FADE IN:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
It is shortly after midnight on an icy night.

An old yellow Mustang pulls alongside the curb on a sleazy
section of Hollywood Boulevard. The passenger door opens and
VIVIAN steps out. She quickly shuts the door and walks away from
the car as if it wasn't there. Cold white breath floats from her
bright red lips.

Dressed in a tight purple leather mini-skirt, sheer black
stockings and a white imitation fur jacket, Vivian is twenty-one
years old. She has been hooking for over five years. Heavy
make-up gives her pretty face a dangerous and hard look.

She lights up a cigarette and takes a drag. She moves gracefully
on spiked heels across the grime-covered sidewalk. She owns this
section of the boulevard. After five years on the street she has
seen it all. She has done everything and will do anything.
Humiliation is for the shy. Fear is for the innocent.

Occasionally a car passes and Vivian's hawk eyes watch it for any
indication of interest.

She passes a vagrant huddled in a pile of ragged blankets and
newspapers in a doorway. She barely sees him; he is simply part
of the scenery.

Across the street a BLACK PROSTITUTE strolls by, rubbing her
shoulders against the cold. At a nearby all-night fast food
stand, several DRUG DEALERS are talking and eating.

Still, except for the occasional sound of police helicopters in
the distance, the street is quiet. It is not bustling with
activity like a TV cop show. It is empty and lonely and cold.

Vivian's ears and cheeks are red from the chill, but her
cigarette keeps her warm inside. A couple more customers and
she'll earn enough for the night.

She glances across the street at a bright yellow Winchell's donut
shop. Half a dozen people sit at the dirty white tables inside.
She sees something that annoys her. She changes course.

Vivian hurries across the street toward the Winchell's.
INT. WINCHELL'S - NIGHT

Behind the counter we see two older VIETNAMESE MEN making donuts,
trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the shop.

As Vivian enters, a gangly, ugly young DRUG ADDICT moves toward
her. His faltering voice and awkward movements indicate that he
is on the last legs of excessive crack use.

DRUG ADDICT
Hi, V-vvivian.

Vivian doesn't even glance at him.
VIVIAN
Hi.

She moves past him toward the back of the shop. Sitting at a
table is KIT, a young, dark-haired prostitute, thin and unhealthy
looking. She is talking with a black OLD MAN.

Kit spots Vivian bearing down on her and jumps to her feet like a
guilty child. Vivian looks at her, annoyed.

VIVIAN
Kit, what are you doing?

KIT
Waiting for you. It's fucking cold out
there.

VIVIAN
It's not getting any warmer tomorrow
night.

The OLD MAN waves at Vivian.

OLD MAN
Hi, Viv.
VIVIAN
Hi.
(to Kit)
Let's get working. We've only got a
couple hours before the street clears.

Kit coughs so loud and deep that it's obvious she has emphysema.

KIT
No one's out, it's too cold. Let's get
high.

Vivian grabs Kit by the shoulder and drags her toward the door.

VIVIAN
We're going to work. Come on.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT

Vivian and Kit come out of the shop and onto the street. As they
walk Kit wraps her arms tightly around her body to shield herself
from the cold. She starts to cough again.

KIT
It's too cold. I'm gonna get sick.

VIVIAN
We've got to work. The rent's coming up.
I'm not going to lose my place.

KIT
We'll make it up tomorrow. Let's get
high.

VIVIAN
How much have you made tonight?

KIT

(hesitantly)

Twenty.

VIVIAN

One fucking date?

KIT
I haven't felt good.

VIVIAN
I'm going to fucking kick you out if you
don't start holding up your end!

Kit's eyes water and she starts to sniffle.

VIVIAN
Don't cry on me. I'm not your mother.
You promised me you'd hold up your end or
I wouldn't have let you move in.

Kit wipes her eyes.

KIT
Tomorrow's Friday. We'll make it up then.
Don't you want to get high?

VIVIAN
I don't want to spend everything we've
got. The rent's coming...

From Vivian's face we see that she is starting to relent.

VIVIAN
Give me the twenty.
Kit reaches down and pulls out a twenty dollar bill from her
sock. She hands it to Vivian. Vivian stares at her levelly.

VIVIAN
You're not holding out on me?

KIT
It's all I've done. No one's out.

Kit starts to cough again.

VIVIAN
(softening)
Maybe it is too cold.

They walk down the street toward the fast food stand.

KIT
Are we going to get high?

VIVIAN
Just be quiet for awhile.

Kit knows that means yes. She rubs her shoulders and hurries to
keep up with Vivian's long strides.

A car approaches slowly and Vivian pauses to watch it. It passes
without stopping. Vivian continues on.

EXT. FAST FOOD STAND - NIGHT
Vivian and Kit approach a Latino DRUG DEALER.

VIVIAN
Where's Carlos?

DRUG DEALER
What you want, girl? I can fix you up.

VIVIAN
Where's Carlos?

DRUG DEALER
The cops got him. What you want?

VIVIAN
I only buy from him. When's he getting
out?

DRUG DEALER
How do I know? You think I'm a lawyer?
You want some stuff or not?

He holds up a small baggie containing three rocks.
VIVIAN
I don't want any of that yellow shit.
Don't you have any white?

DRUG DEALER
This is good stuff.

He shakes them from the baggie into his hand.

DRUG DEALER
I'll let you taste it. Taste it.

He offers it out. Vivian glances around, unsure, looking for
another dealer. Kit comes up to Vivian's side.

KIT
Let's just get it.

The drug dealer offers it to Kit.

DRUG DEALER
Taste it, sugar.

Kit takes a rock and tastes it with her tongue.

KIT
(to Vivian)
Let's get it.

Vivian sighs and pulls out a twenty. Before the dealer can grab
it, she pulls it back.

VIVIAN
Not that one, the big one.

She points at a different rock in the hand of the dealer. The
dealer rolls his eyes around (they all seem the same size to him)
and takes the rock from Kit's hand. He hands Vivian the other
rock. Vivian hands him the twenty.

VIVIAN
When's Carlos getting back?

DRUG DEALER
He's across the street, girl.

He points across the street at another drug dealer who has just
come around a corner. Vivian sees him. She flips the dealer
off.

VIVIAN
You fucker! This better be good stuff.

DRUG DEALER
It's good.
He walks away. Vivian and Kit turn and head back down the
street.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Vivian and Kit stand at the counter of a liquor store. A small
Vietnamese CLERK is behind the counter.

VIVIAN
Give me a pipe kit.

The clerk reaches under the counter and pulls out a small baggie
containing a cheap glass pipe and a bit of steel wool.

CLERK
(in broken English)
You want lighter?

Vivian nods and selects a red Bic lighter from the display. She
hands the clerk a five dollar bill and he hands back the change.
Vivian counts it and then stashes it and the pipe kit away.

VIVIAN
(to Kit)
Come on.

They exit together.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Vivian and Kit walk down the street together, heading for home.

VIVIAN
We should bleach your hair.

KIT
(coughing)
I like my hair.

VIVIAN
You'll make more money if we bleach it.
If you're going to stick with me you're
going to have to make more money.

KIT
(meekly)
Okay.

Vivian puts an arm around Kit's shoulders.

VIVIAN
It'll be pretty. We'll give it a natural
curl or something.
Vivian teases Kit's hair with her fingers.

VIVIAN
You'll like it.

KIT
(more hopefully)
Okay.

Vivian hears a car slowing behind them. She glances over her
shoulder and sees a sleek black Mercedes following them.

VIVIAN
Look at that.

The Mercedes pulls up past them and stops. Vivian and Kit pause.

VIVIAN
(grinning)
There's rent.

Kit isn't happy about the delay, but she waits obediently as
Vivian walks up to the car and leans over the passenger window.

The window electronically rolls down and Vivian looks inside.

In the driver's seat is EDWARD HARRIS, a good-looking, well-
groomed man in his late forties. He is wearing an expensive suit
and tie.

VIVIAN
You want a date?

Edward stares at Vivian coolly. His eyes look at her as if
studying a label on a bottle of wine. He makes a decision.

EDWARD
Yes, hop in.

VIVIAN
How much you want to spend?

Edward smiles, amused for some reason.

EDWARD
What are your rates?

Vivian, influenced by his car, blurts out a high figure.

VIVIAN
A hundred.

EDWARD
For the whole night?
VIVIAN
(quickly)
For an hour.

EDWARD
I'm looking for someone for the whole
night.
VIVIAN
For what?
EDWARD
Whatever.
VIVIAN
Five hundred.
EDWARD

That seems high.

VIVIAN
Three hundred.

Edward is enjoying this game.

EDWARD
Two fifty.

Vivian eyes Edward. Two fifty is more than enough, but she can't
help thinking that she could get more from him. She decides not
to push it.

VIVIAN
Where do you want to go?

EDWARD
I've got a hotel room.

VIVIAN
Okay. Wait a second.

Vivian walks over to Kit's side.

VIVIAN

I'm going to go with him.
KIT

How long?
VIVIAN

I don't know. He said the night. Go on
home. Here...

Vivian hands Kit the baggie with the pipe and the rock.
KIT
Will you be home in the morning?

VIVIAN
I don't know.

KIT
What if I'm hungry?

Vivian pulls out a twenty and hands it to Kit.

VIVIAN
Don't spend more than five.

Kit nods.

KIT
Maybe he'll give me a ride?

Vivian turns back toward the Mercedes and bends down until she
can see Edward through the window.

VIVIAN
Can my friend have a ride home?

EDWARD
No. This isn't a taxi.

Vivian turns to Kit.

VIVIAN
Go on.

Kit coughs. She's unhappy about going home alone.

KIT
I'll wait up for you awhile. In case you
get home. We'll get high together.

Vivian pats Kit affectionately on the shoulder.

VIVIAN
It's okay, babe. You don't have to wait
for me. Just save some.

Vivian gets inside the Mercedes. Kit watches as it drives off.

INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

Vivian sits comfortably in the warm leather seat. She finds the
ashtray on the dash and lights a cigarette with the car lighter.
She looks at Edward curiously as he drives.

VIVIAN
Nice car. Yours?
Edward smiles to himself.

EDWARD
It's rented.

VIVIAN
What's your name?

EDWARD
Edward. What's yours?

VIVIAN
Vivian. What motel are you at?

EDWARD
The Beverly Wilshire.

VIVIAN
Where's that?

EDWARD
Beverly Hills.

VIVIAN
Nice place?

EDWARD
It's all right.

VIVIAN
You from out of town?

EDWARD
New York.

VIVIAN

I've never been to New York. How is it?

EDWARD
It's alright. How do I get back to
Wilshire?

VIVIAN
Make a left up there. Why are you in
L.A.?

EDWARD
Business.

VIVIAN
What kind of business?

EDWARD
(glancing at her sideways)
My, you talk a lot.

10
11
Vivian, squelched, takes a drag from her cigarette.

VIVIAN
Just being friendly.

Edward doesn't say anything.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT

The Mercedes glides through the streets of Beverly Hills.

INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT
Edward looks over at Vivian, who is sitting silently next to him.

EDWARD
My overcoat's in the back seat. Why don't
you put that on?

VIVIAN
Why?

EDWARD
Let's just say you're a little over-
dressed for this.. motel.

VIVIAN
They don't like hookers?

EDWARD
It's not the kind of place that rents
rooms by the hour.

VIVIAN
Every place has hookers. They just don't
like to admit it.

EDWARD
Perhaps so. But if this hotel has any
hookers they don't look like they're...

VIVIAN
off the Boulevard?

EDWARD
Exactly.
EXT. BEVERLY/WILSHIRE HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the
Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Bright flags are illuminated by
carefully placed spotlights.
12

The Mercedes has stopped in a valet parking lane. A VALET opens
the passenger door and Vivian, bundled up in Edward's overcoat,
steps out. Edward hands the keys to ANOTHER VALET.

A DOORMAN opens the huge glass door for Vivian and Edward. They
go inside.

EXT. LOBBY OF THE BEVERLY/WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT

 

The lobby is bright and spacious, filled with thick carved wood
paneling. Even at this hour there is a great deal of activity.
Men in business suits and women in furs and jewels are passing
by.

Vivian's face tries to conceal the awe that she feels at the
sight of all this luxury. Edward is perfectly at home. He
places one hand on Vivian's elbow and guides her through the
lobby as gracefully as he drives his Mercedes.

They reach the elevators and go inside.

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The young ELEVATOR OPERATOR is dressed in a clean red uniform
that seems just a bit too tight. As the elevator doors close he
nods toward Edward.

OPERATOR
Floor, sir?

EDWARD
Penthouse.

OPERATOR
Yes, sir.

The tone of the Operator's voice indicates that Edward will not
have to tell him again. He will remember Edward. There is only
one penthouse.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway leading
to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors. Edward pulls out
his key and unlocks the door. With a gentle push the doors slide
open in unison.

Edward gestures to Vivian to go inside. She does. Edward closes
the doors behind her.
13
INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling
off the top of the building. In front of her is a sunken living
room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the
city below. She is speechless.

Edward is quite at home. He closes the door and walks past her
down the steps to the living room. The living room is filled
with museum quality art deco furniture, all rose and gray and
lavender. On one of the walls is a relief of stylized Egyptian
figures. He picks up a phone.

EDWARD
Room Service... I'd like a bottle of the
house champagne and a bowl of chilled
strawberries sent to my room. Penthouse.
Thank you.

Vivian still stands motionless by the front door. Edward looks
up at her, his trademark half smile drifting to his face.

EDWARD
Nice view?

Vivian says nothing. She makes her way down the steps to the
living room, her legs a little weak.

EDWARD
I've impressed you?

Vivian looks at Edward, her awe giving way to a cynical sneer.

VIVIAN
No. I come here all the time. Asa
matter of fact they do rent this room by
the hour.

Edward laughs. He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans
back.

EDWARD
Very good.

Vivian paces through the room, still hypnotized by the view, but
recovering quickly.

VIVIAN
I don't get it. What's a guy like you
doing cruising Hollywood Boulevard?

EDWARD
Why not?
14
VIVIAN
Hell, you should be able to pick up a
phone and order a girl from Room Service.
(suspiciously)
Unless you're into some weird stuff...

EDWARD
No, not at all. Just the usual stuff. I
don't have that much imagination.

Edward loosens his tie.

EDWARD
To be honest, I wasn't planning on having
a girl tonight at all. I was sightseeing
the Chinese Theater when I got lost.

VIVIAN
Lost?

EDWARD
I don't know the city very well and while
I was driving around I spotted you.

VIVIAN
And fell in love.

EDWARD
Or a close approximation.

A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the front door.

EDWARD
That should be the champagne.

He starts to sit up. Vivian motions for him to stay put.

VIVIAN
Eh, sit! I'll get it.

Edward sits back down. Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the
front door. A WAITER comes into the room with a silver cart; on
it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.

WAITER
Where would you like it?

VIVIAN
Down there, I guess.

The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle of
the living room.

EDWARD
That'll be fine.
15

The Waiter heads back up the stairs and pauses near Vivian.
Vivian stares back at him.

VIVIAN
(annoyed)
What are you looking at?

The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. Vivian closes
the door behind him. Vivian marches back down the stairs.

EDWARD
I think he wanted you to tip him.

VIVIAN
For one bottle?

EDWARD
I quite agree.

Edward stands up and crosses to the silver stand. He lifts the
lid on the bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries. He eats
one. He twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket and then
gracefully lifts it out.

VIVIAN
I still don't see why you picked me up.
Don't you have a girlfriend or a wife, or
both?

Edward deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop
of champagne.

EDWARD
Both. This is the house brand. I didn't
think you'd mind.

VIVIAN
It all tastes the same to me. So where's
your girlfriend and wife? Sleeping
together?

Edward pours the champagne into a single long-stemmed glass and
hands it to Vivian.

EDWARD
My wife divorced me and is in Europe I
believe. My girlfriend is in New York.
Cheers.

Edward drops the champagne bottle back in the bucket. Vivian
holds the glass awkwardly.

VIVIAN
Aren't you going to have any?
EDWARD

I wish I could. But my liver rotted away.

I can't have any alcohol.

VIVIAN
You don't have to get me drunk, honey.

Vivian takes a sip from the glass.

EDWARD

16

No. I just like the smell. Fond memories.

How do you like it?

VIVIAN
Not much. I don't really drink. I smoke
though. I don't guess you do?

EDWARD
No. Not tobacco or otherwise.

VIVIAN
It was the otherwise I wanted.

EDWARD
Try a strawberry. It'll bring out the
sweetness of the champagne.

Vivian eats a strawberry and then washes it down with
champagne.

EDWARD
Better?

VIVIAN
It's okay. Why didn't your girlfriend
come with you?

Edward's face sours.

EDWARD
I don't know. Just being difficult.

Vivian takes another sip and smiles wickedly.

VIVIAN
She wants a new mink.

Edward isn't sure if he finds that funny.

EDWARD
My but we do like to talk.

Vivian shrugs.

the
17
VIVIAN

You want me to shut up, I'll shut up.
It's your two fifty.

She takes another sip from her glass. Edward turns from her and
walks to the windows. He looks out into the city.

Vivian finishes her champagne, goes to his side, and starts to
rub his shoulders. She leans over and kisses his neck.

Edward takes her chin in his hands and studies her face. He runs
a finger over her lips until his finger tip is covered in red
lipstick. He then takes the finger and touches her nose, leaving
a red dot.

EDWARD
Have some more champagne.

He returns to the tray and pours her another glass. Vivian rubs
the lipstick from her nose.

VIVIAN
I don't like it much.

EDWARD
A bit more. Here.

He places the glass in her hand and tips it up toward her face.
She drinks it.

EDWARD
Nothing puts a sparkle in a woman's eyes
like champagne.

Edward's hand continues to lift the glass until Vivian finishes
it. She takes a breath.

VIVIAN
You should see my eyes when I've smoked a
piece.

Edward takes the glass from her hand and sets it down.

EDWARD
Five hundred years ago a cocaine snorting
nation of Indians was enslaved by a few
dozen drunken Spaniards.

VIVIAN
So?

EDWARD
I think it was McLuhan who said that
alcohol is the drug of civilized man.
18

VIVIAN
You like to talk too.

Edward smiles.

EDWARD
Yes. I guess I do.

Vivian glances around the room.

VIVIAN
So where are we going to screw? Or do you
just want to talk?

EDWARD
How about the bedroom?

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edward turns on a light, revealing that the bedroom has been
decorated in keeping with the art deco theme of the penthouse.
Another large relief, this one of prancing unicorns, is mounted
over the bed. The bed itself is enormous and covered with gray
satin sheets and a rose comforter.

Edward walks over to the bed and picks up a mint lying on the
pillow. He tosses it to Vivian.

Vivian catches it, unwraps it and pops it in her mouth.

VIVIAN
(munching)
Can I have my money now?

EDWARD
Oh... yes.

He reaches into his jacket and pulls out a money clip. He takes
five fifties from it and hands them to her. It doesn't appear to
diminish the size of the clip.

Vivian stuffs the money into a tiny pocket in her skirt.

VIVIAN
Thanks, honey.

She gives him a kiss. Edward returns it. Just as he is about to
pull her into his arms she abruptly steps back from him.

She quickly unfastens her clothes. She slips out of her shoes.

VIVIAN
So what would you like? Just a screw, or
you want a blow job first?
19

EDWARD
We'll... play it by ear. See how it goes.

Vivian pulls off her blouse and skirt.

VIVIAN
That means you want the blow job first.

Edward smiles, somewhat embarrassed by her bluntness.

EDWARD
Does it?

VIVIAN
Yeah. You don't mind wearing a rubber do
you?

EDWARD

Seems like a good precaution.

VIVIAN
You look clean but these days you never
know. I don't do it in the ass, either...
unless you want to pay extra.
(beat)
Anything's negotiable if the price is
right. I love money.

She removes her panty hose. Naked but for a pair of black
panties, she sits down on the floor and carefully lays her
clothes out on the carpet, smoothing them down so they won't get
wrinkled.

Edward sits on the bed and watches her, fascinated.

EDWARD

What are you doing?
VIVIAN

I don't want my clothes to get mushed up.
EDWARD

You could hang them in the closet.
VIVIAN

This is fine. I'll help you out of your

clothes.

She stands and walks to Edward, giving him a quick peck on the
cheek. She undoes his tie and pulls it from his shirt. Edward
grabs her wrists, firmly, but gently.

EDWARD
Hey. Slow down. I thought I had you for
the whole night.
20

VIVIAN
Most guys like it quick.

EDWARD
Well, then I'm not like most guys.

Guiding her by the wrists, Edward slowly pushes her back onto the
bed covers. He releases her and settles in beside her. He runs
a finger across her thighs.

Vivian lies back in the bed covers, bored. Edward's fingers pet
her stomach. Vivian winces.

VIVIAN
That tickles.

Edward smiles and touches her stomach again. Vivian sits up
quickly.

VIVIAN
(firmly)
That tickles. I don't like it.

EDWARD
Sorry. What do you like?

VIVIAN
Hot baths and white rocks. Okay? If I
want some guy to turn me on I'll pay you
two fifty. I'm here to make you feel
good. So lay down.

Vivian pushes Edward back onto the bed. She unbuttons his shirt.

VIVIAN
Jesus, champagne, strawberries, mints and
foreplay. You act like you're seducing a
Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.

Edward laughs. Vivian undoes his pants.

EDWARD
I'm an incurable romantic.

VIVIAN
Yeah. Well, you were cruising the wrong
boulevard for romance.
(beat)
But if you want a good fuck, you found the
best. Just lay down and let me drive.

Vivian slips off the bed and walks to the light switch. She
turns it off.
21

In the faint light that leaks through the cracks in the door, we
see her return to Edward. She lies on top of him and kisses him
full on the lips. Edward wraps his arms around her.

They make love.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Vivian turns on a light. The bathroom is large, decorated in
gray tile and gold trim. There is a huge sunken bathtub in the
corner of the room.

Vivian looks at herself in the mirror. Her hair is tangled and
loose, and her body damp with sweat. With her fingers she combs
out her hair to untangle it.

She unrolls a handful of toilet paper and wipes the sweat from
her forehead and neck. She uses her finger to adjust the smeared
line of her lipstick.

She turns off the light.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vivian is sitting on the floor picking up her clothes. Edward
slides over on the bed to see her.

EDWARD
What are you doing?

VIVIAN
Getting my clothes.

EDWARD
I thought we had all night.

VIVIAN
What? You want to do it again? I thought
I finished you off.

EDWARD
You did. But stay the night. I'd like to
sleep with you. I'll get you a taxi in
the morning.

Vivian sighs.

VIVIAN
Why do you want to sleep with me?

EDWARD
I don't like to sleep alone.
22

VIVIAN
Your girlfriend fucking spoils you.

EDWARD
She does.

Vivian stands up and walks over to the bed.
VIVIAN
Alright. Move over, Romeo.
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

The elevator doors open and A WAITER rolls a cart out into the
hallway. He takes it to the doors of the penthouse. He rings
the bell.

EDWARD (0.S.)
Come in! It's open.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

 

The Waiter carries in a tray of food, a bottle of champagne, and
orange juice. Edward, dressed in silk pajamas and a black velvet
robe, stands in the living room talking into a cordless phone.

EDWARD
Cindy, if you really miss me then take a
plane and get out here.

Edward points the Waiter to the dining table.

EDWARD
I don't care what your agent says. One
week isn't going to ruin your career.

The Waiter sets down the tray and returns. Edward picks up his
wallet from an end table and hands the Waiter a five dollar bill.
The Waiter nods and exits.

EDWARD
I want you here. You know how I get when
I'm doing business.

Edward walks over to the dining table and lifts one of the tray
covers. Inside is a gourmet breakfast.
23

EDWARD

(becoming angry)
You promised me when you started this
whole modeling thing that I would still
come first. Now I'm telling you to get
out here. Today.

(beat)
Cindy!

She's hung up on him. Edward slams the phone down on the table.

EDWARD
Spoiled bitch.

Edward takes a deep breath to calm himself. He pours a glass of
orange juice and takes a sip. Still agitated, he crosses through
the living room to the bedroom door.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Vivian is asleep in the bed. She is not a light sleeper. Her
body is in an awkward position and her mouth is frozen half open
on her tranquil face. She looks young and childlike.

Edward stares down at her for a moment. He sips his orange
juice. He is thinking again. Making a decision.

EDWARD
(loudly)
You're quite a sleeper.

Vivian stirs roughly.

EDWARD
Good morning. Would you like some
breakfast?

Vivian's eyes open painfully and she squints at Edward. She
shakes her head, trying to wake up.

VIVIAN
I forgot where I was.

EDWARD
That must be an occupational hazard.

VIVIAN
This is a nice bed. It's so soft. I
sleep'd like a stiff.

EDWARD
Would you like some breakfast? It's still
hot.
24

VIVIAN
I don't eat in the morning.

EDWARD
You should. Come on.

Edward picks up his shirt from the night before and tosses it to
her.

INT. DINING TABLE IN LIVING ROOM - MORNING

 

Vivian wears Edward's shirt as they sit at the dining table.
Edward dishes out some food and sets it in front of her.

VIVIAN
My head hurts. It's that champagne you
made me choke down.

Edward pulls the champagne bottle from its bucket.

EDWARD
A hair of the dog.

He deftly pops the cork.

VIVIAN
No. I'll get sick.

Edward fills a third of the glass and tops it off with orange
juice.

EDWARD
Just a bit. With orange juice. I
guarantee it will make you feel better.

Vivian reluctantly takes the glass.

VIVIAN
I don't like orange juice either.

EDWARD
Don't you like anything?

Vivian swallows some orange juice.

VIVIAN
White rocks. Hot baths.

EDWARD
Well, you're welcome to take a nice long
bath. The one in the bathroom is
practically a pool.

VIVIAN
I saw it. But I have to go.
25

She picks up a fork and starts examining the food on her plate.
Edward begins to eat.

EDWARD
I wanted to talk to you about that.

VIVIAN
What is this stuff?

She eats a forkful.

EDWARD
Crepes.

VIVIAN
It's good. The orange juice isn't that
bad neither.

She takes another sip.

EDWARD
I'm going to be in town until next Friday.
I'm involved in a important business deal
and I won't have the energy to try to
chase down girls when I need to relax...

Vivian is wolfing down her food hungrily.

VIVIAN
(her mouth full)
You want my number? But I charge more on
Saturdays. Especially with the sleeping
thing. I'd lose a lot of business.

EDWARD
Hey, slow down. I'm not going to take
your plate away from you.

VIVIAN
Sorry. I guess I was hungry after all.
So you want my number?

She finishes off her glass and refills it, favoring the
champagne.

EDWARD
Actually, I was wondering if you would
like to stay here for the week.

Vivian tries to conceal her surprise at his offer. Not many
people are interested in her during the day. It takes her a
moment to respond.
26
VIVIAN

(trying to act cool)
It'd cost ya.

EDWARD
How much? Let's see if I can afford it.

VIVIAN
Well, seven full nights and days too?

EDWARD
Yes. You can do what you want during the
days, but I'd like to have you on call, so
to speak.

VIVIAN
Two thousand.

Edward sports the same faint smile that he always gets when he's
negotiating money.

EDWARD
Two fifty a night for seven nights is only
seventeen hundred and fifty dollars.

VIVIAN
But you want me during the days too. And
last night you didn't get me till after
twelve. I did some good money before you
picked me up.

EDWARD
I'm sure you did, but seven nights of
steady work. Shouldn't I get a discount
or something? How about fifteen hundred?

VIVIAN
Don't be an asshole. You know you've got
two thousand. This fucking room must cost
you a couple hundred a night.

Edward smiles broadly at that. Vivian notices.

VIVIAN
Or more!

EDWARD
I like to know I'm getting my money's
worth. I struck a good deal on this room,
too.

VIVIAN
(firmly)
Two thousand.
Edward pours himself some more orange juice.

EDWARD
Alright. I like you. Two thousand it is.
But let me tell you, I have very tough
business to do. There is a lot of
pressure involved. When I get tense, I
need someone to help me relax. That means
no problems. No hassles. Understand?

27

The thought of all that money is starting to warm Vivian's voice.

VIVIAN
Sure, honey. I'1l treat you like a prince
for a week. Anything, any way you want.

EDWARD
I'm not just talking about sex. I need
some nice pleasant company.

VIVIAN
I'll treat you so nice you'll never want
to let me go.

EDWARD
Fine. But I will go. This is only for a
week. I want you to be clear on that too.

VIVIAN
Hey, I'll be looking forward to spending
my money when you're gone.

Edward smiles.

EDWARD
I wish my lawyer was that honest. I
wouldn't even risk this, except I feel
like you're a very sensible girl.
Businesslike. So it's a deal?

VIVIAN
I need to go back to Hollywood and get
some things.

EDWARD
No, I want you to stay here while you're
with me. I don't want any trouble. We'll
buy anything you need. What do you want?

Vivian smiles awkwardly.

VIVIAN
Well, a little bit of rock. Just to get
me through the week. I'11l pay for it
myself.
28

EDWARD
No. No drugs. Not while you're with me.

VIVIAN
I just need a little buzz. It's no
different than champagne.

EDWARD
Champagne is legal. Drugs are illegal.
That's enough of a difference to me.

VIVIAN
I can't go a whole week without getting
high. I don't know if I can go a day...

EDWARD
(shrugs)
Then I'll have to call Room Service and
get another girl.

Vivian sits in silence for a moment. Edward watches her from the
corner of his eye. He enjoys negotiating. Vivian face toughens.
She looks at Edward levelly.

VIVIAN
Alright. A week. But I want three
thousand.

Edward studies her for a moment. He knows when to close a deal.

EDWARD
That's fair. Hardship pay. Three
thousand dollars for one week, no drugs,
no strings attached.

VIVIAN
It's a deal.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Vivian is stretched out in a hot bubble bath. Her face shows
almost orgasmic pleasure. She starts to laugh.

VIVIAN
Three thousand! Three thousand fucking
dollars!

Gloating, she lies back and sinks down into the warm bubbly water
and disappears.

She pops back up, shakes out her hair and laughs again.

VIVIAN
Three thousand!
29
Edward comes into the bathroom and stands by the door, watching

her laugh. He has just finished dressing and is trying to get
his tie tied.

EDWARD
Happy, huh?

VIVIAN

Listen, lover. When I'm not giving you
the best fucks of your life, I'm gonna be
right here, in this tub. Have Room
Service bring the cart in.

(laughing)
Three thousand. To sit in a bathtub for
seven days.

EDWARD
I'm overpaying you. Aren't I?

VIVIAN
Hey, I'd have taken a thousand, but we
both know you can put up three. Can't
you?

EDWARD
(smoothly)
I don't think it will break me.

VIVIAN
Then it's a good deal for us both. I'1l
keep you happy, lover.

EDWARD
Good. I've got to meet with some people.
I'll probably be gone most of the day.

VIVIAN
I'll be right here.

Edward is still struggling with his tie.

EDWARD
I can never get these things right. Cindy
always does them for me. Do you know how
to do these?

Vivian slides to the edge of the tub and wipes her hands on a
towel.

VIVIAN
Let me see.

Edward walks over to the tub and leans over. Vivian reaches up
and tries to tie his tie.
30

VIVIAN
How does this go?

She makes a mess of it. She undoes it and tries again.

EDWARD
Forget it. You're killing my back.

VIVIAN
No, let me try again. I got to learn how
to spoil you like your girlfriend does.

Edward continues to hunch over. Vivian finally gets something
that is almost close.

VIVIAN
There.

Edward straightens up and glances in the mirror.

EDWARD
Close enough. You have the rest of the
week to practice.

Edward reaches into his wallet and pulls out his American Express
Gold Card. He sets it down on the sink.

EDWARD
Here. Buy some nice clothes on Rodeo
Drive. A few dresses, not too fancy, or
too sexy. Soft pinks and pastels are
nice. I just want you to look presentable
in the hotel. Understand?

VIVIAN
Yeah. You want me to dress like your high
class girlfriend.

EDWARD
Well, let's hope you don't spend that much.

VIVIAN
How much can I spend?

EDWARD
Be reasonable. You're a smart girl. I'1l
make you a deal. If you spend too much
I'll send it all back at the end of the
week. If you're sensible, I'll let you
keep it. Fair?

VIVIAN
Fair.

Edward walks over and kisses her on the cheek.
31

EDWARD
"Bye.

VIVIAN
"Bye, lover. It's gonna be a fun week.

Edward smiles and exits. Vivian relaxes back in her tub.

VIVIAN
Three... thousand... dollars.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian is back in her street clothes, lounging about on an art
deco couch, talking on the cordless phone.

VIVIAN
You wouldn't believe it, babe. It's like
Dynasty or something. It's a gas. He's
leaving next Friday. I'11l be back then.

We hear Kit's voice on the other end of the phone.

KIT (0.S.)
But Viv, I don't have any money. What
will I do till you get back?

VIVIAN
Work, baby. You're supposed to be
working. I'm not your mother. I'11l
handle the rent, you just keep yourself
going for a week. Pick up some blow jobs.
You can do that.

KIT (0.S.)
(softly)
Okay.

VIVIAN
Listen, baby. I'm making good money.
Good money. When I get back we're gonna
move to the Strip and work the good part
of town. Just like I promised. We'll get
a nice place -- not like that shithole
we're in now. I always told you I could
get the class tricks.

KIT (0.S.)

That's cause you're pretty, Viv. But I
don't think I could work the Strip. I'm
not pretty like you.
32

VIVIAN
Babe, I'm telling you we'll get your hair
done up right and you'll be a knockout.
Okay?

KIT (0.S.)
Okay.

VIVIAN
You take care of yourself. I'1l be back
in a week. It's not that long.

KIT (0.S.)
Okay.

VIVIAN
"Bye, baby.

KIT
"Bye.

Vivian presses a button to hang up and sets the phone down on the
table. She leans back in the couch, happy and comfortable. She
pulls the American Express card from her pocket and admires it.

VIVIAN
Time to shop.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Vivian is dressed in her street clothes, without the black
stockings, white coat, or heavy makeup. She doesn't look quite
so much like a hooker, but she's not altogether respectable
either.

She is waiting for the elevator. When the doors open she
saunters inside.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

The Elevator Operator stands by the controls as Vivian comes in.
He notices, but tries not to stare at her out-of-place attire.

VIVIAN
(cheerfully)
Hi.

OPERATOR
Hello. Lobby?

VIVIAN
Yeah.

The elevator starts down.
33

VIVIAN
I'm going to be staying here for awhile.

The Operator nods.

OPERATOR
Excellent.

Vivian smiles at him. He reluctantly returns it. The elevator
reaches the bottom floor and the doors open.

VIVIAN
I'll be back.

The Operator nods as she steps into the lobby.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Vivian gets strange looks from the hotel employees and customers
as she strolls through the lobby.

Their stares make her feel uneasy by the time she reaches the
front door. She hurries outside.
EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Vivian comes out onto Wilshire Boulevard and looks around. She
is less confident and excited then she was before. She's feeling
a little lost in this strange place.

She crosses the street and heads up Rodeo Drive.

EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian passes store windows, looking at the expensive things
inside. Something about it all makes her jittery.

She comes to a posh women's boutique. She hesitates for a moment
and then enters.

INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the
disapproving stare of a SALESWOMAN standing behind the counter.

SALESWOMAN
(with a Beverly Hills sneer)
Can I help you?

VIVIAN
I'm just looking.
34

Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with delicate

glass objects. She cautiously examines a dress.

The Saleswoman, unhappy with Vivian's clothes, appearance, and

voice, quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.

SALESWOMAN
Are you looking for something in
particular?
VIVIAN
I need some new clothes.
SALESWOMAN
(sarcastically)

Yes.

Vivian eyes the Saleswoman suspiciously. She's beginning to
the drift. She points at a dress.

VIVIAN
How much is that?

SALEWOMAN
I don't think it would fit you.

VIVIAN
(claws coming out)
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how
much.

SALESWOMAN
It's very expensive.

get

Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman, violence in

her eyes.
VIVIAN
What's with you?
SALEWOMAN
(unblinking)
Pardon?
VIVIAN
What's with this fucking look on your
face?
SALESWOMAN

I think you should leave. You're
obviously in the wrong place.

Vivian is so angry and frustrated she is speechless.

SALESWOMAN
Please leave.
35

Vivian turns and stomps toward the door. She stops and spins
around staring at the Saleswoman incredulously.

VIVIAN
I was going to spend fucking money here!
What's with you?

The Saleswoman says nothing. Vivian flips her off. She throws
the door open and storms outside.

The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns to
her place.

EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost. A MAN passes,
eyeing Vivian as if she were a freak. Vivian's face is red. Her
eyes water up to cry. She takes a deep breath, trying to control
herself.

She looks up and down for another shop. On the street, women in
elegant designer outfits stroll by. Vivian suddenly feels naked.

She heads back toward the hotel.

INT. HOTEL - DAY

Vivian enters the lobby, nervous and paranoid. She heads toward
the elevators. She feels an emptiness in her stomach at the
sight of all the luxury around her. Only this time she doesn't
have Edward to guide her.

MR. THOMAS, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, spots her. He
crosses the room and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.

MR. THOMAS
May I help you, miss?

Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror.

VIVIAN
I'm just going to my room.

MR. THOMAS
You're a guest here?

VIVIAN
I'm.. I'm with a friend.

MR. THOMAS
And who is that?

VIVIAN
Edward...
36
Vivian face is filled with terror. She doesn't know his name.
Her hands are trembling.

MR. THOMAS
What's the matter?

The elevator doors open behind them. She spots the operator.

VIVIAN
(blurting it out)
He knows me!

Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously. The Operator
looks back at them innocently. With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas
waves the Operator over.

MR. THOMAS
Do you know this young lady?

The Operator nods.

OPERATOR
She's with Mr. Harris.
MR. THOMAS
(surprised)
Mr. Harris?
OPERATOR

She joined him last night. Apparently.

VIVIAN
(voice quaking)
I just want to go back to my room.

The Manager's tone toward Vivian changes dramatically. He waves
the Operator away.

MR. THOMAS
Are you alright?

VIVIAN
I just want to go back to my room.

MR. THOMAS
Why don't you come with me? We'll chat
for a moment.

He takes her arm firmly and leads her off.

INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY

In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a
comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk.
As he addresses her his voice is firm, but warm. Fatherly.
37

MR. THOMAS
My dear, I want you to understand that
there are certain things that don't happen
in the Beverly Wilshire. Things that go
on in other hotels. You understand?

Vivian says nothing.

MR. THOMAS
But Mr. Harris is a very special customer
of this hotel. And we like to think of
our special customers as friends. As a
customer, I would expect Mr. Harris to
sign in any additional guests that he
wants to spend the night. But as a
friend, we're willing to overlook it. I'm
assuming you're a relative. You must be
his niece.

Vivian finds herself nodding.

MR. THOMAS
Of course. Naturally when Mr. Harris
leaves, I won't see you in this hotel
again. Correct?

Vivian nods.

MR. THOMAS
I would also encourage you to dress ina
more appropriate manner.

Vivian quickly pulls out her American Express card and hands it
to him as if it somehow validates her actions.

VIVIAN
I was trying to get some other clothes...
but... they wouldn't...

She can't go on. Mr. Thomas politely glances at the American
Express card and hands it back to her. He sighs wearily. The
things he must do to keep his "friends" happy.

He walks around his desk and picks up the phone. He dials a
number.
38

MR. THOMAS

(into the phone)
Women's clothing.

(beat)
Could I speak to Bridget.

(pause)
Bridget, hello. This is Mr. Thomas at the
Beverly Wilshire. Well, that's
flattering. Listen, I'm going to send
someone to you. She's the distant niece
of a special customer of ours. A very
special customer: Mr. Harris. Yes, the
Long Island Harrises. His niece is.. from
out of town. You know. And she needs a
little help dressing. Maybe you could
help her pick something. Thank you very
much. She'll be right over.

Mr. Thomas sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at

Vivian.

MR. THOMAS
There you are. Go to Saks down the
street. It's a tall building with a black
front. Not far from here, thankfully. Go
straight to the second floor and ask for
Bridget. She'll take care of you.

Vivian stands up. She's calmer now.

VIVIAN
Thanks.

MR. THOMAS
If you have any other problems come ask
for me personally. I'm Mr. Thomas.

Vivian nods. He shows her to the door. She exits. He watches
her go, unhappy about the whole matter.

INT. SAK'S / SECOND FLOOR - DAY

The elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room

nervously.

She wanders toward the women's clothing section.

BRIDGET, a large friendly woman, spots her.

BRIDGET
You must be Mr. Harris's niece.

Vivian nods.

BRIDGET
What's your name, dear?
39
VIVIAN
Vivian.

BRIDGET
Well, the mini-skirt is dead, Vivian. I
don't care how many designers try to bring
it back, it's dead. Goodness, you look a
like a streetwalker in that. Let's find
you something else. Come on.

Bridget leads Vivian into the racks of clothes.

BRIDGET
Where are you from, dear?

Vivian is silent for a while.

VIVIAN
Iowa.

BRIDGET
No wonder. How about this?

Bridget holds up a brown designer dress.

VIVIAN
(timidly)
Do you have something in soft pink?

BRIDGET
Like a pastel?

INT. SAKS - DAY

Vivian is dressed in a pink pastel dress with fine white beading
around the neck and shoulders and a tiny lace collar.

BRIDGET
You look lovely.

Vivian nods. She seems dazed and weary. She hands Bridget the
American Express Card. Bridget takes it.

BRIDGET
Do you have any shoes for it?

Vivian shakes her head. Bridget leads her off.

BRIDGET
Come, come.
40
INT. SAKS - DAY

Bridget is ringing up Vivian's new dress and matching hat, purse
and shoes. She packs Vivian's old clothes in a paper bag. She
hands Vivian the small credit card form. Vivian signs it.

BRIDGET
We have a salon on the third floor. Maybe
you'd like to get your hair and nails
done?

Vivian glances at her nails; they are a hideous shade of deep
red.

BRIDGET
Go on. It's a treat. By the time you get
back to Iowa they'll think you were born
in Beverly Hills.

EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - DAY

Vivian's nails are pink. Her hair is cut and styled more
conservatively and done up in a bun. She wears a soft white hat
and pink shoes and a pink dress. In her hands is a pink and
white purse. Her makeup has been redone. She walks down
Wilshire, still quiet and dazed. But lovely.

She carries a bag containing her working clothes. She stops at a
trashcan and throws the offending items away, hoping no one
notices.

She approaches the hotel and pauses. Her eyes are drawn to the
other side of the street: Rodeo Drive. It seems ominous to her.

She sucks in a breath and crosses the street.

EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian walks up Rodeo Drive again. Her manner is uneasy, but
determined, as if forced to stroll down a dangerous street on a
dare. She is better armed this time, in a suit of impenetrable
pink armor.

She darts by the boutique that kicked her out, trying not to be
seen by the saleswoman on the other side of the window.

She continues on to another shop. She takes a breath and enters.

INT. ANOTHER BOUTIQUE - DAY

Vivian strolls though the store, poker-faced but weak at the
knees. She stops at a dress and fingers it.
41
ANOTHER SALESWOMAN comes up alongside her.

SALESWOMAN
It's very pretty. Would you like to try
it on?

Vivian turns and looks at the Saleswoman. Blood flows back to
her skin. Vivian flashes a trademark Beverly Hills bitch sneer.

VIVIAN
Why not?
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian strolls up the street, carrying a clothing box. Her step
is lively, and her face has a trace of a snotty smile.

A well-dressed man passes by, smiling politely. Vivian's nose
lifts as she happily ignores him. She heads for another shop.

INT. BOUTIQUE #3 - DAY

Vivian is in a dressing stall, tossing a dress outside to a
NERVOUS SALESWOMAN.

VIVIAN
Nope.

ANOTHER NERVOUS SALESWOMAN holds a long purple evening gown.

A.N.S.
How about this one?

VIVIAN
Ick! I want something in a pastel.
That's horrid.

N.S.
There's a mint green dress in the
window... ?

VIVIAN
Yes! Let me try that on.
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags. She has
perfected her Beverly Hills sneer. She owns this block.

On her way back to the hotel she returns to the first boutique.
Without a beat of hesitation she marches in.
42
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

Vivian, her hat partially obscuring her face from the Saleswoman,
sails into the store carrying all her boxes and bags. The
Saleswoman smiles to herself. Obviously a professional shopper.

Vivian strides over to the dress she originally looked at. She
fingers it roughly.

SALESWOMAN
(eagerly)
Isn't it pretty? It's on sale.

Vivian abruptly faces the Saleswoman and stares at her coldly.

VIVIAN
It wouldn't fit me.

Vivian marches toward the front door. She turns back to the
Saleswoman, who is trying to remember who Vivian is.

Vivian flips her off again, just to remind her.

VIVIAN
"Bye.

Vivian exits. The Saleswoman stares after her.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DAY

Vivian walks confidently through the hotel lobby, past the
admiring gazes of several businessmen. She enters the elevator.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

In the elevator, Vivian is gripping her packages like loot from a
conquered city. The Operator doesn't recognize her. He starts
the elevator up.

OPERATOR
Floor, ma'am?

VIVIAN
(smoothly)
Penthouse.

The Operator does a double take. Vivian smiles at him.

VIVIAN
Hi again. Like my new dress?

OPERATOR
It's.. lovely.
43

VIVIAN
Mr. Thomas picked it out for me.

OPERATOR
Oh... ?

They reach the top floor. The doors open. Vivian steps out.

VIVIAN
"Bye.

The Operator watches her go.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - SUNSET

 

Vivian, in her pink dress but without the hat, stands in front of
the glass windows, staring out into the city reflectively.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

Edward steps to the front desk and catches the eye of a DESK
CLERK.

EDWARD
Any messages?

The Clerk hands Edward a few message slips and a telegram.
Edward sorts through them. He is tired and on edge.

Mr. Thomas, standing on the other end of the desk, eyes Edward.
He deftly approaches and speaks in a low intimate voice.

MR. THOMAS
Good evening, Mr. Harris.

Edward continues looking through his messages.

EDWARD
(absently)
Hello.
MR. THOMAS
I met your.. "niece" in the lobby today.
EDWARD
(looking up)
My niece?
MR. THOMAS

That pretty young girl staying in your
room. I just assumed...

Edward and Mr. Thomas's eyes meet. They are engaging in some
sort of subtle power struggle. A struggle that Edward intends to
win.
44

EDWARD
I don't have a niece.
MR. THOMAS
Ah, my mistake.
EDWARD
That pretty young girl in my room is a

prostitute.
Mr. Thomas can't think how to respond.

EDWARD
Do you have a problem with that?

MR. THOMAS
(softly)
No, sir. Have a good evening.

Mr. Thomas bows slightly and walks away. Edward watches him go
and turns back to the hotel Clerk, suddenly in a good mood.

EDWARD
Have some champagne sent up. Anda
cheese tray or something. Maybe a pate
and some bread. A large bottle of
mineral water. And strawberries.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

 

Vivian is sitting demurely on the couch when Edward comes in from
the hall. She stands up and smoothes her dress anxiously.

VIVIAN
Do you like it?

Edward strolls down the steps to the living room, studying her.
He smiles.

EDWARD
It's lovely.

Vivian sighs with relief.

VIVIAN
I had my hair done. I hope that was okay.

EDWARD
Yes. I like it.

Edward gives her a quick kiss and sits down in a chair,
exhausted. He loosens his tie and uses one foot to try to slide
the shoe off the other. It's stuck. He reaches down to untie
the shoe, but before he can Vivian practically throws herself at
his feet.
45

VIVIAN
Here, let me help you.

Vivian kneels at his feet and unties his shoes. She pulls them
off and sets them down next to the chair.

VIVIAN
Socks too?

EDWARD
That's alright. My feet were just
swelling up.
(pause)
I had an interesting talk with the hotel
manager downstairs.

VIVIAN
(looking down)
Oh.

Edward takes Vivian's chin in one hand and raises her head. He
looks into her eyes.

EDWARD
Listen to me. I don't know what happened
with you two, and I don't care. I'm paying
a bundle for this room and I expect to be
treated with respect. That includes you.
If anyone hassles you, or makes you feel
uncomfortable, you tell me. I'll see that
they're fired promptly. That includes Mr.
Thomas. Understand?

VIVIAN

(happily)
Yeah.

EDWARD
I don't care whether you're a prostitute,
my wife, my niece or the First Lady. As
long as you're my guest, the people in
this hotel will treat you like a queen.
Alright? If I have to, I'll buy the hotel
and burn it down to prove my point.

Vivian smiles brightly. He lets go of her chin and relaxes in
his chair.

EDWARD
Now, it looks like you did some shopping...

Vivian reaches over to the end table and picks up a pile of
credit card receipts.
46

VIVIAN
I saved all the receipts. I bought three
dresses and some other stuff. That hat
over there goes with this dress.

EDWARD
Only three dresses?

VIVIAN
Well, I didn't figure I'd be going out a
lot. And clothes are so expensive around
here. Two of them were on sale, but even
then it all came to eight hundred and
fifty seven dollars. I could have done
better at Sears or something but...

EDWARD
That's fine. You could teach Cindy a
lesson in saving money.

VIVIAN
(eagerly)
You want to see what I bought?

Edward couldn't care less, but he decides to indulge her.

EDWARD
Yes, I'd love to.

Vivian jumps up, runs to the couch, and picks one of the boxes
she brought home. She opens it to reveal a long mint green
dress.

She unzips her dress and pulls it off. Underneath she is wearing
a soft pink teddy. She picks up the green dress and starts to
put it on.

EDWARD
New underwear too?

Vivian stops pulling up her green dress. She lets it drop to the
floor and models the teddy.

VIVIAN
Yeah, like it?

EDWARD
Very much.

VIVIAN

Good, I got another one that matches this
dress.
47
She steps out of the green dress and runs over to a bag

containing some underwear. She throws off the pink teddy and
puts on the green one.

VIVIAN
And I got a white one too, for my yellow
dress. I couldn't find a yellow one.

She holds up the white teddy.

VIVIAN
I kinda thought they were sexy. But
classy too...

EDWARD
Yes.

The front door chimes.

EDWARD
That's Room Service.

VIVIAN
(joking)
Maybe I should answer it in my teddy.
Give him a thrill?

EDWARD
Let's not.

VIVIAN
(embarrassed)
No. I wasn't going to. I was just
kidding.

Vivian pulls on the mint green dress. She zips it up and darts
up the steps to the door. She pulls the door open to reveal a
BELLBOY with a tray of food.

VIVIAN
Come on in. Put it down there.

The Bellboy carries the tray down the stairs. He sets it down
and returns to the door. Without getting up from the chair,
Edward hands him a five dollar bill as he passes.

After he has exited, Vivian shuts the door.

Edward wearily gets up and walks over to the tray of food. He
pulls the champagne from the bucket and pops the cork. He pours
a glass for Vivian. He opens the mineral water and pours some
into a champagne glass.

As Vivian comes down the steps Edward hands her the champagne.
Vivian takes it. Edward holds up his glass of water.
48

EDWARD
Cheers.

They clink their glasses together. Vivian takes a long swallow
of champagne.

VIVIAN
I'm starting to like this stuff. Let me
show you the yellow one.

She returns to her clothes and puts it on. It has a
conservative, almost businesslike look to it.

VIVIAN
Like it?

Edward carries the bottle of champagne over to her and refills
her glass. He kisses her.

EDWARD
I like it. I'm pleased.

VIVIAN
Great. Now I'll show you the good stuff.

EDWARD
The good stuff?

VIVIAN
(between champagne sips)
Well, I figured you weren't going to be
taking me out a lot, so I figured what I
really needed was some sexy lingerie for
when I was in.

Vivian moves over to another set of boxes. She pauses and eyes
Edward suggestively.

VIVIAN
Why don't you relax while I show you?

Edward sits down.
MONTAGE OF VIVIAN'S OUTFITS
As Edward sits in the chair Vivian changes from outfit to outfit.

She slides up to him in a sexy long white lace and silk
nightgown. She does a turn so he can see it. He smiles. Vivian
tosses the nightgown into his lap as she tries on something else.

She takes a long sip from her champagne glass as she shows him a
sexy pair of red tap pants and matching camisole.

Edward refills her glass as she shows him a black corset and long
stockings.
49

Vivian tosses the stockings onto Edward. He is accumulating a
pile of lingerie on his lap.

Vivian comes up to him in a short bright pink nightie. Very
drunk, she sits on his lap and finishes off the last of her
champagne. She lets the glass drop to the carpet and kisses him.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edward carries a drunk Vivian into the bedroom and gently lays
her out on the bed.

VIVIAN
Did I do good?

Edward rolls her into the covers.

EDWARD
Yes.

He takes off his coat and shirt.

VIVIAN
I got most of it at this great sale. A
lot of it's polyester, but that white one
is real silk.

Edward pulls off his pants and climbs into bed with her. She
pulls him into her arms and snuggles up to him drunkenly.

VIVIAN
It only cost around two thirty-five.

EDWARD
You did very well.

VIVIAN
(a little worried)
Are you going to let me keep it all?

EDWARD
Yes. It's yours.

Vivian's eyes light up. She kisses Edward warmly.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian and Edward eat breakfast at the living room dining table.
Vivian is dressed in one of her sexy nightgowns.

VIVIAN
What do you do all day while you're gone?
50
EDWARD
Meet with lawyers and stockbrokers. Read
financial reports. It's pretty boring.

VIVIAN
What's it for?

EDWARD
I'm acquiring a company.

VIVIAN
What kind of company?

EDWARD
It's called Kross Enterprises. It used to
build ships. Nowadays it doesn't do much
of anything.

VIVIAN
Why would you want it?

Edward takes a sip of his orange juice and looks at Vivian
sideways.

EDWARD
Are you really curious?

VIVIAN
Yeah.

EDWARD

All right. Warn me if I bore you. Twenty
years ago Kross was a huge corporation, and
even though they're almost bankrupt today, they
still have millions in assets. Real estate,
equipment, pension funds. Things that can be
liquidated to generate cash. You understand?

VIVIAN
What are pension funds?

EDWARD
That's cash invested in various accounts to
pay worker's retirement and health benefits.
Sometimes it's hard to get at. But with
good lawyers you can usually strip them down
since only part have been contractually
promised to the employees. Anyhow, we
figure Kross is worth about 400 million. We
hope we can acquire it for between two and
three hundred million. No matter what, I'm
going to make a profit. The question is how
large.
51

VIVIAN
(thinking hard)
If it's worth that much money, why doesn't
somebody else try to buy it?

EDWARD
Try is the key word there. People have
tried. But not everyone has a hundred
million to toy around with like this. And I
know of assets the corporation owns that
other people aren't aware of. It's worth
more than most people think. Besides, the
company management isn't particularly happy
about being sold, because they'll be out of a
job.

VIVIAN
Oh.

EDWARD
I wouldn't lose any sleep over them. They
got the corporation into the mess it's in
now.

VIVIAN
So you can make all that money just by
buying it and then selling everything?

EDWARD
Something like that.
VIVIAN
(admiringly)
What a racket!
EDWARD
(smiling)
Yes.
VIVIAN
So that's how you got rich? Buying
companies?
EDWARD

No. It's been passed down through the
family. But I've doubled it in the last
eight years. These are good days for
making money.

VIVIAN
That's great.

Edward shrugs.
EDWARD
I'm going to have to get dressed, I have a
meeting at ten. Tomorrow I'll give you a
lesson on short selling.

VIVIAN
Okay.

EDWARD
You're a good listener. I like that.

He stands up and gives her a kiss on the cheek.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Edward, fully dressed, is standing at the front door as
ties his tie. She finishes.

VIVIAN
There you go.

EDWARD
How does it look? Do I need to check it?

VIVIAN
No. I've got it down. It looks great.

They kiss.

EDWARD
I'll see you this evening.

52

Vivian

He exits. Vivian stands by the door for a moment and then walks

down the living room steps.

She opens a large cabinet in the wall that conceals a television.

She switches it on and lies down on the couch.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY

Edward is being led through the corridors of a brokerage house by

VANCE, a well-dressed young stockbroker.

VANCE
We can't buy any more stock without filing.
I just can't conceal it any longer. We
might hide it under another name for a week
or two, but we could get into trouble later.

EDWARD
No, no. Let's play by the rules. We'll
just move quickly.
53
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian is on the phone.

VIVIAN
How about hamburgers? Do you have any
hamburgers? Great. And fries. And
ketchup. Yeah. I'm in the penthouse.
The penthouse on the top floor. Right.

EXT. HELIPORT ON TOP OF SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Edward and Vance come out of a doorway on to the rooftop of a
large skyscraper. There is a sleek corporate helicopter waiting
on a landing pad. Edward and Vance lower their heads as they
fight through the wind generated by the propellers.

As they near the helicopter, a young man in a business suit,
JAKE, comes out to greet them. They all have to shout over the
sound of the engines.

VANCE
Mr. Harris, this is Jake Conway. He's our
top researcher. He'll be giving us the
tour.

JAKE
It's a pleasure, Mr. Harris.

EDWARD
Good to meet you.

They all climb into the helicopter. It takes off.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

An empty plate that once held a hamburger sits on the dining room
table.

Vivian is stretched out on the couch. She had been watching
television for hours. She flips through the channels using a
remote control. There's nothing on.

She turns the television off. She lays her head down on the
couch and stares off into the distance, bored.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Vivian comes out of the elevator wearing her mint green dress.

She strolls though the lobby on her way to the hotel dry goods
store.
54

She spots Mr. Thomas. With a wicked look on her face she walks
up behind him and puts a arm on his shoulder.

VIVIAN
Hi. How are you?

Mr. Thomas looks at her uncomfortably.

MR. THOMAS
Fine. Hello.
VIVIAN
How do you like my dress? Better? Hey?
MR. THOMAS
It's very pretty. The color is very good
on you.
VIVIAN

Thanks. See ya.
She smiles brightly and saunters off. Mr. Thomas watches her go,
more amused than annoyed at her.
INT. DRY GOODS STORE - DAY

Vivian buys a pack of cigarettes.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Vivian sits in the bathtub smoking a cigarette. It isn't
satisfying. She tears off the filter and takes a few drags.

She gives up and tosses it into the toilet. She sinks into the
tub.

VIVIAN
How the fuck am I going to last a week?
EXT. PORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

A helicopter flies over the port.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

They look over a huge shipyard as Jake describes it for Edward.
55

JAKE

This is the jewel in Kross's crown. Prime
industrial property straddling the Port of
Long Beach and Los Angeles. We can strip
out all the heavy equipment. Some of the
cranes are very valuable overseas. World
War II stuff that nobody builds anymore
because it costs too much. The Japanese
are salivating for them.

Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.

EDWARD
What's that long building over there?

JAKE
Waste processing plant. They don't use it
anymore. Most of the yard we'll just
level. The real estate possibilities are
endless. In fact, I talked to a couple
developers -- under the table, of course
-- and they said we could...

EDWARD
(cutting him off)
You what?

JAKE
(tentatively)
I talked to some developers about the
land.
EDWARD

What kind of idiot are you? You don't
talk to anyone about this but me!

JAKE
I'm sorry, sir. They're close friends;
they'd never breathe a word...

Edward glares at Vance.

EDWARD
Where did you dig this moron up?

Vance angrily turns on Jake.

VANCE
He's absolutely right, Jake. That was an
incredibly stupid thing to do.

EDWARD
You people are supposed to be
professionals.
56

VANCE
It won't happen again. I'11 pull Jake off
the project.

EDWARD
No. Don't bother. He's probably already
told everyone he knows.

JAKE
I'm very sorry, Mr. Harris.

EDWARD
Forget it. Let's go up the coast. I want
to look around.

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY

Edward, Vance, and Jake enter a large meeting room. Sitting at
one end of a long conference table, piles of papers spread out
before him, is WILLIAM, a crafty-looking lawyer with wire-rimmed
glasses. Edward smiles broadly upon seeing him.

EDWARD
Bill! Where the hell have you been?

WILLIAM
Working on your damned pension funds.
I've found the angle. We can bleed them
dry.

EDWARD
Yeah, if your boys at the brokerage don't
leak the whole deal.

WILLIAM
Leak? What?

EDWARD
Skip it. Jake's going to be good from now
on. Aren't you?

Edward gives Jake a friendly pat on the shoulder.

JAKE
(quietly)
Yes, sir.
EDWARD

Listen, there's something you need to look
into right away. There's a chemical
treatment plant at that shipyard. I want
you to see if the permits are still valid.
And what kind of limits are on them.
57
WILLIAM
Treatment plant? What... oh! You son of a
bitch! What a brain!

EDWARD
Don't get too excited yet. Check the
permits first.

Edward sits down next to William. He glances back at the other

two men.

They exit.

EDWARD
Thanks for the tour. Keep your mouths
shut. I'll see you tomorrow.

BOTH
Yes, sir.

William glances at Edward quizzically.

WILLIAM
What are you ragging them about?

EDWARD
Ask them. Where are we at?

WILLIAM
The Board knows we're after them. A call
came down from Kross. He wants to talk to
you alone.

EDWARD
(laughing)

About what?

WILLIAM
Your intentions.

EDWARD
Alright.

WILLIAM

I don't think you should.

EDWARD
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

WILLIAM
I'll have to be present when you talk.
58

EDWARD
No. Everyone knows you're my muscle. If
the three of us sit down together then we
might as well announce it in the Wall
Street Journal. I'11 meet him in public
for dinner. Less suspicious. Tonight, if
you can arrange it.

WILLIAM
I can. But you shouldn't go alone. He
might claim that you tried to blackmail
him or something.

EDWARD
I'll bring a girl. That'll keep it all on
a friendly level.

WILLIAM
That might do. You brought Cindy along?

EDWARD
No, the little cunt's in New York.
Pretending she's a model. World's only
five-foot two-inch model. But I've got a
little girl to keep me company while I'm
here. She'll do for the evening.

WILLIAM
Alright. I'1l set it up.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian, dressed in a teddy, is dozing on the couch with the TV
on.

The phone rings. Vivian wakes up with a start. She looks at it,
unsure. It rings again. She debates whether to pick it up. It
rings again.

Finally she picks it up.

VIVIAN
Hello?

EDWARD (0.S.)
(firmly)
Don't ever pick up the phone. Ever.

VIVIAN
I'm sorry. I didn't know. You didn't
tell me...
59
EDWARD
It's alright this time. I needed to talk
to you. But from now on, you don't ever
answer it. Understand?

VIVIAN
Yes.

EDWARD
We're going out to dinner tonight. I want
you to look your best. I don't think you
have any clothes that will do. Go buy
something a little more formal. Something
dark and low cut. But tasteful. Spend
whatever you have to. If you don't know
what to get, tell the salesgirl you're
dining at Rex. And have your hair done.
We're a little pushed for time so I'1l meet
you in the lobby at seven forty-five. âBye.

VIVIAN
"Bye.

Vivian slowly sets the phone down.

INT. DRESSING ROOM AT SAKS â- DAY

Vivian is in a private dressing room as Bridget helps her squeeze
into a tight-fitting black evening dress.

Bridget tugs upward on the sides of the strapless dress and
shakes it a bit to get Vivian's breasts in place.

BRIDGET
There we go. Take a breath.

Vivian sucks in and Bridget zips up the back. Vivian steps over
and looks at herself in a mirror.

BRIDGET
Your uncle will like this.

A sheepish look spreads across Vivian's face.

VIVIAN
He's not really my uncle.

Bridget shrugs.

BRIDGET
They never are.
60
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

With her hair done up and bound with a string of imitation
diamonds, Vivian looks elegantly sexy in her black evening dress.
The only thing spoiling the picture as she waits in the lobby is
the sloppy way she drags on a cigarette.

She gets more than a couple of admiring glances from male hotel
patrons. She spots Mr. Thomas standing behind the check-in
counter and crosses to him.

VIVIAN
(nervously)
How do I look?

Mr. Thomas smiles politely.

MR. THOMAS
Stunning. But Miss Vivian, it really
isn't necessary for me to approve every
outfit you wear.

Vivian puffs away on her cigarette.

VIVIAN
I'm just shaking âcause Edward is taking
me to this really fancy place. The Rex?
Is that a nice place?

The ashes from Vivian's cigarette fall to the carpeted floor.
Mr. Thomas winces. He slides an ashtray toward her.

VIVIAN
Oh sorry.

She stashes out her cigarette in the ashtray.

MR. THOMAS
It's a very nice restaurant.

VIVIAN
Do I look okay for it?

MR. THOMAS
You look fine. Mind what fork you use.

VIVIAN
(absently)
Yeah...

She spots Edward entering the lobby. He gestures for her to come
to him.

VIVIAN
Got to go. âBye.
61

She quickly crosses the lobby toward him. As she does, her face
sours as a thought comes to her.

VIVIAN
Fork?

INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT

An array of different forks are neatly lined up on the tablecloth
next to Vivian's salad plate. She stares down at them.

EDWARD (0.S.)

I'll be happy to look into it for you. To
be honest, I don't know if we've bought
any of your stock.

Edward sits across the table from Vivian. He selects the last
fork on the left of the plate and begins eating the salad.

KROSS (0.S.)
Don't play any fucking games with me,
Harris. You know damn well what stock you
have and what you don't.

Sitting next to Vivian is JAMES KROSS, in his early 70's, a bulky
self-made millionaire industrialist. In his youth he was foreman
in a steel mill and during World War II pioneered the use of
welding instead of riveting in the construction of war ships.

But age is beginning to take its toll on him. His skin is
unhealthy looking and his large hands sometimes tremble when he
speaks.

He picks up the fork closest to his plate and starts to pick at
the salad.

KROSS
I know you have control over at least
twenty percent of the stock.

EDWARD
(calmly)
Then call the S.E.C.

Vivian glances back and forth between Kross and Edward's forks,
trying to figure out which one she should use. Does each person
use a different one?

KROSS
If you push me I might.

EDWARD
(politely)
Are you threatening me?
62

Edward notices Vivian out of the corner of his eye. She looks at
him helplessly. He studies her curiously.

KROSS
You might have some explaining to do.
Those guys are tired of parasites like you
jerking them around.

As he talks, Edward eyes Vivian and gently taps his finger to the
empty spot where his fork had been. Vivian gingerly picks up
that fork from her setting. Edward winks at her. She starts to
eat.

EDWARD
Really, Mr. Kross. I don't think we have
anything to talk about. Maybe you should
see my lawyer.

KROSS
I came here to talk to you. Not to eat
succotash or stare at your girlfriend's
tits. I want to talk business.

Edward sets down his fork, abruptly stands, and places his napkin
next to his plate. He nods toward Vivian.

Vivian has just stuffed her mouth full of salad. She looks up at
Edward confused.

EDWARD
Let's go, Vivian.

Vivian obediently stands, still clinging to her fork.

KROSS
Harris, wait.

Kross stands as well. Edward stares at him coolly.

KROSS
I'm sorry. That was out of line.

Edward says nothing. He starts to turn away. Kross quickly
turns toward Vivian.

KROSS
Miss, I'm sorry about that remark. I
apologize. It was uncalled for.

Vivian finishes chewing and swallows quickly.

VIVIAN
Oh, it's okay.

Edward looks over at Vivian with stern sympathy.
63

EDWARD
Are you sure, Viv?

Edward has never called her "Viv" before. Vivian stares at him,
unsure. She doesn't know what to say, what he wants from her.
She glances at Kross, who waits for her reply.

VIVIAN
Yeah... it's okay.

Edward picks up his napkin and slowly sits. Vivian and Kross
sit. Edward leans toward Kross and speaks to him in a low firm
voice.

EDWARD
I didn't have to come here. I don't have
to talk to you. If you have something to
say you better say it without threatening
me or insulting the lady.

Kross hands tremble as he adjusts his napkin onto his lap and
tries to calm down.

KROSS

I'm sorry. I'll get to the point. I
think you're trying to take over my
company. If you do get it, and if what
I've been told about you is true, you'll
liquidate it.

(pause)
I don't want that to happen. I built this
company up myself. I've run it for forty
years. We're in bad shape right now, but
we're going to get through it..

As Kross talks, the WAITER comes by and checks their salads.
Edward indicates that he's finished. The Waiter begins
collecting plates. Vivian, though she's finished her salad, is
still clinging to her fork. The Waiter pauses at her side. She
sees him and sets down her fork. He whisks the plate away.

KROSS
I came here to talk to you man-to-man to
see if I can reason with you. What do I
have to do to get you to call off the
dogs?

EDWARD
I don't understand you.

KROSS
What would it cost to buy out your stock?
Name your price.
64

EDWARD
I really don't know. But from what I've
heard, your company doesn't have any cash.

The Waiter returns with the next dish. He sets a plate in front
of each of them. As they talk, Edward subtly lifts the correct
fork and taps it to the table. He half smiles at Vivian.
Vivian, studiously watching his prompting, selects the correct
fork. They both begin to eat.

KROSS
Not.. right now. But we're going to get a
large contract to build four destroyers for
the Navy. They're a revolutionary design
and, once we can prove it, I know we'll get
more orders. I could give you a promissory
note.

EDWARD
Then I'd be in a position of making your
company a loan. That doesn't seem to make
much sense.

KROSS
We'd pay you interest. As soon as we get
the contract --

Edward shakes his head.

EDWARD
Mr. Kross, you're not going to be getting
any Navy contracts.

KROSS
(upset)
What do you mean?

EDWARD
Just that. You're not going to be getting
any new contracts from the military. I
know.

KROSS
(incredulous)
You've sabotaged them?

EDWARD
You flatter me if you think I can tell the
Pentagon what to do. But I do know you
aren't getting the contract.

Kross sits quietly dazed. Much as he would like to believe it is
a lie, he knows Edward is telling the truth.
65

Vivian half watches him as she eats from her plate. Edward takes
a bite of his food and then speaks smoothly.

EDWARD
Now let me propose something to you. If I
do decide to acquire your company, I will
file the proper papers with the S.E.C. If
that was to happen, I would suggest that you
and the Board cooperate with me, rather than
try to fight it. You couldn't stop me, you
could only lower my profit margin. If you
don't fight me, you'll find I can be a
valuable friend.

Kross shakes his head, amazed at Edward's arrogance.

KROSS
You want me to recommend to the Board that
my company be raped by a man like you?

EDWARD
It's not your company. It's a public
company. We both know that you can barely
keep it going for a couple more years
before you've completely drained it. It's
a waste of capital to keep it running when
it isn't going anywhere.

A MAITRE D' comes up and stands politely next to Edward. Edward
pauses and glances at him.

EDWARD
Yes?

The Maitre d' whispers in a low voice to Edward. Edward nods and
the Maitre d' exits. Edward turns to Kross.

EDWARD
Now it's my turn to apologize. I'm afraid
that I have a private call that I must
deal with. If I may be excused...

Without waiting to see if he's excused, Edward stands and exits.

Vivian and Kross sit quietly. Vivian eats with her usual strong
appetite. Kross seems to be pondering some dilemma. He stares
at Vivian. He knows he has been beaten, but it's difficult to
take in front of this pretty young woman.

KROSS
Your boyfriend's a real sharpie, little
girl. A real shark. That's the kind of man
that makes it these days. They smell money
like blood.
66
Vivian stops eating. Kross continues, his voice full of emotion.

KROSS

There was a time when men got rich by
building things. I built ships the size of
cities! Ships that could rule the seas into
the next century. Why, last year the Navy
recommissioned a ship out of mothballs that
I built forty years ago. They did it
because they knew damn well no one could
build anything better! We built this
country into the greatest industrial power
the world has ever known. We creamed the
Japanese! We dwarfed the rest of the world.
Dwarfed! This country sent men to the moon!

(beat)
But something happened...

He shakes his head uncertainly.

KROSS
We made mistakes, maybe. I don't know. We
lost our way. Listened to too many Harvard
fags telling us how to maximize profits.
And now men like your boyfriend, they
survive by feeding off our decay. They
make themselves rich by sucking the money
out of our shipyards. Blind to the future.
They're destroying everything we built.

His eyes focus on Vivian. She is moved by his speech.

KROSS
Hell, I was no saint. I screwed people
too. But for every guy I stepped on, I
gave a hundred a good job. Men like
Harris are different. They don't give,
they just take. But stay with him, little
girl. You don't want to be on the wrong
side of the fence when this country falls
apart. He's going to be a good little
meal ticket for you.

He is finished. Vivian stares at him, frozen.
Edward returns to the table.

EDWARD
My apologies again.

KROSS
Forget it. I have to go anyway.
67

EDWARD
At least stay for dinner.

KROSS
No. Thank you for this talk. You've
cleared my head. I know what to do now.

EDWARD
Which is?

KROSS
I'm not going to pay you off. I'm going
to fight you with every resource I have.
Neither you nor any of your cronies will
ever set foot in my shipyards. You'll
burn in hell first.

Kross stands up.

EDWARD
If you feel that way, do what you have to
do. But if you change your mind, I won't
hold it against you. Just tell me that
you've changed your mind and I'll forget
about this conversation.

KROSS
What are you rambling about?

EDWARD
If you change your mind. Come to me. My
door will be open.

KROSS
I'm never going to speak to you. I'm
never going to see your face again. I'm
just going to stop you. Got that?

Kross tosses his napkin into his plate and leaves.

Edward sits down in his chair, calm and relaxed. He takes a sip
from his water glass. He smiles brightly at Vivian and then
laughs.

Across the table Vivian stares at him unsmiling.

VIVIAN
Why are you laughing?
EDWARD
You and your fork. You were such a

picture.

A Waiter comes up.
68
WAITER
Would you like the next course, sir?

EDWARD
(brightly)
Yes. Yes, but just for two.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

 

Vivian's face is pensive and thoughtful as she stares out of the
glass window down at the city lights. She quickly drains her
champagne glass.

Edward stands next to her. He refills her glass with the bottle
in one hand as he talks on the wireless phone with his other.

EDWARD
We were right, they don't have any cash.
The only card he had was the Navy contract
and we know what happened to that. It's
perfect. Kross is the only thing in our
way and he's ready to cave in. Lots of
big talk, but one push and he's over the
edge. I could see it in his eyes.

Edward crosses the room and sets the champagne down on a table.

EDWARD
Well, that's your job.

Vivian holds her glass in a daze. Edward, full of energy, paces
back to her, as he listens intently to the phone.

EDWARD

Do some research. The guy used to be a
millionaire. But it's been downhill for
over twenty years. He must be over
leveraged. Where's he get his money these
days? What banks are loaning it to him?
Find out. We have lots of friends. It
wouldn't take much. A couple phone calls.

Something catches Edward's attention. His eyes focus on Vivian's
head. He touches the diamond string wrapped around her hair bun.

EDWARD
(holding his hand over
the phone receiver)
Are those real?

Vivian shakes her head "no. Edward smiles.

EDWARD
They look lovely.
69

He leans over and gives her a kiss on the cheek. Back into the
phone he says:

EDWARD
Now you're thinking. Get on it. We're
going to wrap this up by Friday. I know
it now. Talk to you tomorrow.

He clicks the phone off. He takes it to the table and sets it
down. He turns toward Vivian and slowly stalks toward her.

EDWARD
Have I ever told you how very, very
beautiful you are?

VIVIAN
(weakly)
No.

EDWARD
You are, you know. Very beautiful.

He wraps an arm around her waist and gives her a deep kiss.

EDWARD
I certainly could have done a lot worse
for a wrong turn on Hollywood Boulevard.

Vivian turns away from him and quickly downs her champagne.

EDWARD
Easy, doll. You're supposed to sip it.

Vivian crosses to the bottle on the table.

VIVIAN
(coolly)
I thought you liked me when I was drunk.

She fumbles a little as she picks up the bottle. She starts to
refill the glass, spilling champagne all over. Edward pulls the
glass and bottle away from her. He sets them down on the other
end of the table. He takes Vivian by the wrists and turns her
toward him. His dark eyes peer into her.

EDWARD
Why are you running away? You've been
acting strange all evening. Are you mad at
me?

VIVIAN
No.

EDWARD
Then kiss me again.
70
Vivian throws her arms around his neck and kisses him fiercely.
Edward's hands slide up her thighs and across her back. He runs
them through her hair and unties the bun. Vivian shakes her hair
out and it falls across her shoulders.

Edward gazes into her eyes. Vivian looks away. She roughly
unzips the back of her dress and pulls it from her shoulders.

Before she can get it off, Edward grabs her by the wrists again.

EDWARD
Why are you in such a hurry?

Vivian says nothing, her eyes are on the floor.

EDWARD
Am I so ugly to you? Am I fat and
disgusting? Do I smell bad?

VIVIAN
(softly)
No.

EDWARD
People have been so bold as to tell me I'm
somewhat attractive. Aren't I to you?

VIVIAN
You're very... handsome.

EDWARD
Then why are you in such a rush to get it
over with? We have all night. Is it
really such a chore? Are you so jaded
that you never enjoy making love?

Vivian pulls away and turns her back on him.

VIVIAN
(firmly)
Not with customers.

EDWARD
Why not? I think I've been pretty good to
you the last few days. Haven't I treated
you well?

Vivian stands silently for a moment.

VIVIAN
(softly)
yes.

EDWARD
I can't hear you.
Edward takes her by the shoulder and spins her around.
are full of tears.

VIVIAN
Yes!

EDWARD
Why are you crying?

Vivian says nothing. Edward shakes her gently.

EDWARD
Answer me.

VIVIAN
It's your fucking champagne. You got me
all weird inside. I drank too much.

EDWARD
(gently)
Tell me why you're crying.
VIVIAN
Leave me alone!
(desperately)

What do you want from me?!

EDWARD
My money's worth.

Another tear slides from Vivian's eyes.

VIVIAN
I've given it to you.

EDWARD
No you haven't. I thought I had you for a
week, but you're keeping something from
me. It's hidden back there in a dark
corner of your eyes. In the shadows. And
every time I see you keeping it from me it
makes me want you more and more. Why are
you so determined to hold back?. Let me
have it. Let me see it in your eyes for a
few days. It's only for a week. Is that
so much to ask?

Edward gently takes her into his arms.

VIVIAN
I don't know what you're saying. You
don't make any sense. Just let me go,
please. Let me go.

Her eyes

71
72

Edward kisses her tenderly. Vivian is limp in his arms, tears
rolling down her neck.

EDWARD
Do you want me to make love to you?

Vivian looks into his eyes.

VIVIAN
yes...

EDWARD
There. That's all I wanted.

Vivian's eyes focus upon him. She reaches up and, with trembling
lips, she kisses his cheek.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Vivian, dressed in a white silk nightgown, sits on the carpet in
the middle of the living room. Her head is down and her hair is
a tangled mess that covers her eyes.

Edward, dressed in his usual business suit, comes from the
bedroom, struggling with his tie. He sees Vivian sitting limply
on the floor.

EDWARD
What are you doing?

VIVIAN
Just sitt'n.

EDWARD

Why don't you sit on the couch, or go back
to bed? Don't you feel alright?

VIVIAN
I've got a little headache.

EDWARD
No wonder, the way you were drinking last
night. You want to do my tie?

VIVIAN
Yes.

She pulls herself off the floor and walks to him. She bites her
lip as she deftly ties it into a neat knot. Edward glances at
his reflection in the plate windows to see if it is alright.
73
EDWARD
Hmmm. Cindy always ties it so that the
emblem is right in the center of the knot.

VIVIAN
Oh.

She reaches for him to try to re-tie it.

EDWARD
No, that's alright. I don't have time.
This will do.

Edward gives her a warm kiss. She doesn't return it. Her eyes
are glassy.

EDWARD
I hope you feel better. I'11 be gone all
day. Maybe we'll have dinner someplace
nice tonight.

VIVIAN
(hopefully)
I'd like that.

Edward smiles at her and walks away. He exits up the stairs.
Vivian watches him go.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Vivian, wearing her pink dress, strolls by shops in the hotel
lobby, half-heartedly window shopping. She keeps glancing around
the lobby as if waiting for someone.

She spots Mr. Thomas coming out of a back room. She crosses the
lobby and heads for him.

Mr. Thomas spots Vivian and half smiles. He isn't quite sure
what he thinks about her. Her presence in his hotel makes him
nervous, and yet he secretly enjoys her company.

VIVIAN
(cheerfully)
Hi.
MR. THOMAS
Miss Vivian.
VIVIAN

I've got to talk to you. Boy, did you mix
me up last night with that line about the
fork. I think I made a fool of myself.
74
MR. THOMAS

(honestly concerned)
How?

VIVIAN
Oh, I didn't know which fork to use so I
kept holding off and everyone used
different ones and Edward laughed at me.

MR. THOMAS
Oh, I'm sorry. It really isn't that
difficult.

VIVIAN

Well then show me. Edward might take me
to dinner tonight and I don't want to look
like a dummy again.

Mr. Thomas looks around the lobby uncomfortably.

MR. THOMAS
Well, I'm on duty right now. Just use the
one on the left.

VIVIAN
No, you got to show me the whole thing.
The whole dinner thing. From the top.
You got me in this mess.

MR. THOMAS
(amused)
I..2 How am I responsible?

VIVIAN
Because if you hadn't told me, I wouldn't
have even thought about it. Now I'm all
jittery.

Mr. Thomas smiles and glances around the lobby again. Everything
seems quiet enough. Why not?

MR. THOMAS
Alright, come with me, young lady. In
fifteen minutes I can teach you everything
you need to know to dine with the queen.

INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY
Mr. Thomas's desk is laid out with two opposing sets of

silverware. He shows Vivian the correct piece from his side and
she mirrors his actions from the other.
75

MR. THOMAS
And as you pick up the knife you shift
your fork to the left hand.

Vivian does this.

VIVIAN
Hey, I knew that one. I always do that.

MR. THOMAS
You had good parents.

VIVIAN
But the other guy ate like this.

Vivian switches the fork and knife.

MR. THOMAS
Well, he was either European or badly
brought up.

VIVIAN

No, he was a rich guy too. I could tell.

MR. THOMAS
That doesn't mean a thing. Some of the
richest people I've met have the worst
manners. Of course, Mr. Harris, being of
old money, knows his way around a table.

VIVIAN
What's old money?

MR. THOMAS
That means he has inherited his money down a
long family line. It used to be fashionable
to look down upon people who became rich
through their own labor.

(shrugging)

In fact, it seems to be in fashion again.
But let's continue with our lesson. Most
restaurants don't even lay out their silver
correctly, so if they don't, it isn't your
fault if you pick up the wrong utensil.
Spoons...

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY

Vance is punching numbers into a computer terminal as Edward and
William watch the display.

VANCE
The word's on the street. Stock's at ten
and a quarter.
Edward smiles.

EDWARD
Flight of fancy. Let's offer eight.
should bring them back down to earth.

76

That

Then

we'll raise it to nine and close the deal.

WILLIAM
I'1l work on the papers.

VANCE
So we're filing?

EDWARD
Yes. Time to jump out of the closet.

INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

Edward and William are lounging together at the end of a long
meeting table. A LOVELY YOUNG SECRETARY comes in and serves them

coffee from a tray.

SECRETARY
How do you like it, Mr. Reaves?

WILLIAM
(suggestively)
Any way I can get it, angel.

The Secretary forces herself to smile politely.

SECRETARY
Cream or sugar?

WILLIAM
Both.

EDWARD
Black.

The Secretary pours the coffee into two cups and
them neatly on the table. She picks up the tray
William watches her go.

Edward takes a sip of his coffee.

EDWARD
So, tell me about Kross.

William waits until the Secretary has closed the

saucers and lays
and exits.

door and then
WILLIAM
You're right, as usual. Completely
mortgaged down to his grandson's
scholarship funds. Best of all, he's
applying for another loan.

EDWARD
Bank we know?

WILLIAM
Oh yeah.

EDWARD

Need me to call anyone?

WILLIAM
Nope. It's handled. Nice and quiet. You
can forget all about it.

EDWARD
(sipping his coffee)
I will.

Edward changes the subject.

EDWARD
So why don't we go to dinner tonight? You
can leer at this girl I have for the week.

WILLIAM
Is this the tramp whose honor you defended
from Kross? You think she'll make me stiff?

EDWARD
William, you have the class of a
pubescent. In answer: yes and yes.

INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Edward, William, and Vivian are dining at another elegant
restaurant. Vivian is decked out in her black low-cut dress.

77

William stares at her cleavage as she eats daintily, holding her

silverware carefully in her hands.
78

EDWARD

(to Vivian)
Tell Bill what you said to me, that first
night.

(to William)
It was something like "if you're looking
for romance you were cruising down the
wrong street. But if you want to fuck,
you've found the best..."

(to Vivian)
Was that how it went?

VIVIAN
(uncomfortably)
Yeah, I think so.

William stares at Vivian fixedly.

WILLIAM
You look very familiar to me. Haven't I
seen you before?

Vivian shakes her head no.

WILLIAM
You work for Robert's agency, don't you?

VIVIAN
No.
WILLIAM
Oh.
(to Edward)

I thought that's where you got your girls?

EDWARD

You must be joking. Pay a fortune to have a
high class gold-digger to leech off you.
Last time I called them, I ended up spending
ten grand for a skinny little thing that
kept pressuring me to buy her jewels. I
found Vivian on Hollywood Boulevard and
she's charging me a third of that. And
she's happy to get it, aren't you?

Vivian meekly nods. She isn't enjoying the conversation.
79

WILLIAM
Jesus, Edward, you're the only billionaire
I know who would go catting around
Hollywood looking for a bargain
streetwalker. Just because you got one bad
girl doesn't mean you should write off the
whole agency. When you get a girl from
Robert's you're paying for discretion.

EDWARD
What do I need discretion for? I'm
divorced. And I don't need a girl who
speaks French better than I do. Vivian
has been an absolute doll. I had to buy
her a few things so that she'd be
presentable, but I'm still going to save
money in the long run.

William shakes his head. He glances over at Vivian.

WILLIAM
Can you believe the way this guy talks?
Do you know how much he's worth?

Vivian doesn't answer. She lowers her eyes and concentrates on
her food.

EDWARD
Why are you always pushing Robert's on me,
Bill? You own a piece of that?

WILLIAM
(irritated)
No. It's just a nice agency and I like to
keep my clients happy. But if you can
find true love in Hollywood, for a great
markdown, that's okay by me.

Edward leans over to William.

EDWARD
She's a real tiger in bed.

WILLIAM
(eying her)
I'll bet she is.

Edward eats. William watches Vivian push the food around on her
plate. He seems bothered by something.

EDWARD
(amused)
What are you thinking about, Bill?
WILLIAM
(looking away)
Nothing.

EDWARD
You interested? I don't mind.

WILLIAM
Jesus, Edward, don't be so tacky. I can
rent my own girls.

EDWARD
I can read you like a freeway sign.

WILLIAM
(tensely)
I'm not interested.

EDWARD
Go ahead. Vivian doesn't care. She's used
to six guys a night. Just be sure you wear
a condom. She's careful about that.

WILLIAM
Thanks, Ed. That really turns me on. Now
can we just drop it? Don't we have
anything else to talk about?

Edward leans back in his chair and smiles smugly.

EDWARD
North American Steel.

80

William glares at Edward and then laughs, relaxing at last.

WILLIAM
No. No way. You'll never get it. Nota
prayer.

EDWARD
Why not?

Vivian stares at Edward expressionlessly.

INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Edward and Vivian come into the room. Edward switches on
light. Vivian walks down the steps into the living room.
face is rigid, her eyes are focused on the floor.

Edward follows after her.

a
Her
81

EDWARD
My, you're quiet. You haven't said a word
to me since we left the restaurant. I
kind of like it, but...

As Edward touches her shoulder Vivian suddenly spins and explodes
with anger, pounding him with closed fists.

VIVIAN
You fucker! You fucking bastard!

Vivian frantically pounds away at Edward, not so much to hurt
him, but as if purging herself of emotion.

Edward pulls back for a moment and then forcefully grabs her arms
and throws her onto the couch.

EDWARD
Have you lost your mind?!

Vivian jumps up and runs at Edward. Edward grabs her and throws
her down onto the couch. Before she can get up again, Edward
pushes her back down. Tears well in Vivian's eyes as she yells
at him.

VIVIAN
You fucking asshole. I can't believe what
a shit you are!

EDWARD
Would you please tell me what you're mad
about?

VIVIAN

I'm not a fucking piece of meat for you to
offer to your friends!

Edward is taken aback. He adopts a gentler tone. Vivian sits on
the couch, seething with rage.

EDWARD
Alright. Just calm down.

VIVIAN
I almost picked up that fucking table and
smashed it in your fucking face. I almost
did it!

EDWARD
I appreciate your self control.
82

VIVIAN
I've fucking beat the shit out of street
pimps. I could beat the shit out of you!
I almost started screaming in the
restaurant I was so mad. I would have
punched you in the face and walked out of
there, but... but...

Vivian's voice cools to an icy calm.

VIVIAN
I wanted my money.

EDWARD
I'm sorry. It never even occurred to me
that you would mind. Honestly.

VIVIAN
(exploding)
I WANT MY FUCKING MONEY! I'm getting out of
here! I don't want anything to do with you!

EDWARD
(firmly)
Lower your voice.

VIVIAN
Give me my money.

EDWARD
Can we talk about this? Can you just try
to calm down?

VIVIAN
I'm going crazy âcause you won't let me
get high. I'm bored out of my fucking
mind all day and whenever I see you you
treat me like shit! You don't like the
way I eat. I never tie your tie right. I
don't drink enough and then I drink too
much. You're always shitting on me!

A tear falls from Vivian's eyes. Edward shakes his head at her,
incredulous.

EDWARD
I'm sorry. I thought I was treating you
pretty nicely.

VIVIAN
I've fucked stinking old men that made me
want to puke, but I've never had anyone
make me feel as dirty as you do! You make
me feel dirty inside.
83

EDWARD
I.. I wasn't even serious. It was just a
joke. I was razzing Bill because he runs
this call girl service. We tease each
other like that. It's quite juvenile.
But I didn't think you'd mind my saying... I
mean, it's not as if you're froma
convent.

VIVIAN
YOU DON'T OWN ME! I say when! I say who!
I say how much! If I make a deal with you
it's between me and you and if he wants to
FUCK ME TOO then he can ask me and I'll
tell him how much!

EDWARD
Of course. You're right. I'm sorry.

VIVIAN
I don't fuck anyone who sticks their dick
out at me. I fuck who I want! I say how
much! I run my life! You don't run my
life!

EDWARD
Vivian, I'm very sorry. You're absolutely
right. That was an idiotic and
insensitive thing I did. I can tell that
you have a lot of pride and I should have
known that that would hurt you.

Vivian jumps to her feet.

VIVIAN
It didn't hurt me! It doesn't hurt you
when someone pisses on you! It just
pisses you off!

Edward's face sours. She is trying his patience.

EDWARD
Alright. I've apologized. I've said I'm
sorry. Now if you want to take what
you've earned so far and walk out of here,
I'll understand.

Vivian doesn't say anything.

EDWARD
Do you want me to call a cab?

Vivian is still silent.
84

EDWARD
Do you?

VIVIAN
I don't know.

EDWARD

Then think about it. But we're going to
get past this. I've apologized already.
I've heard what you have to say. You're
right, and it won't happen again. But if
you can't get past it then you should
leave, because I'm only going to be here a
couple more days and I'm not going to
spend it fighting with you. Understand?

VIVIAN
(bitterly)
Fuck off.

EDWARD
Alright. I'll call a cab. If you want
the clothes, pack them up.

Vivian stands frozen for a moment. Suddenly she spins and
marches into the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light of
the bedroom. As she does she starts crying. With each item of
clothing the tears come down harder. Finally she is crying so
hard she can't breathe. She lets the clothes fall from her arms
and starts to shake uncontrollably.

Edward appears at the doorway. His face is genuinely concerned.
Vivian sobs in fits, gasping for air.

EDWARD
(tenderly)
I'm sorry. I really am sorry.

Vivian finally manages to breathe again. She stands limply. Her
face is smeared black with mascara.

VIVIAN
You ..
(barely audible)
Â«hurt me.

Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders. She
touches his hand.
85
INT. BATHTUB - NIGHT
Edward and Vivian are taking a bath together. It isn't a bubble

bath. Edward wipes the black mascara from Vivian's eyes with his
wet hands.

EDWARD
I've been a fiendish cad, and I'll make it
up to you.

VIVIAN

I got so crazy. I'm not like that. I
don't know why I got so crazy.

EDWARD
(exaggerating his
Harvard accent)
Because I was a boor, a clod, an oaf, a
cretin, a dunce, a putz, a shmuck..

He washes the black from his hands and caresses her checks again
with warm water.

EDWARD
Â«but I shall make amends as only a Harris
can.

He runs his little finger across her eyebrows and down her nose.

EDWARD
I shall give you an experience that will
last a lifetime.

Vivian smiles.

VIVIAN
Yeah, sure. You're good, lover, but not
that good.

EDWARD

Vivian, your mind is always in the gutter.

Mine's only there frequently. I speak not

of the lower forms of pleasure, but of high
art.

VIVIAN
What?

EDWARD
I'm going to take you to the opera.
86
EXT. FANCY CLOTHING STORE ON RODEO DRIVE - DAY

 

Edward holds Vivian by the hand as they stand in front of a
display window. Inside the window is a stunning red sequined
dress.

EDWARD
That's it. That's what you're wearing
tonight.

Vivian's eyes light up like a child on Christmas morning.

INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

Edward sits on a comfortable chair sipping tea as he waits by the
dressing room. A prim, elegantly coiffed SALESWOMAN stands at
attention by his side.

Vivian comes out of the dressing room modeling the red dress.
She looks beautiful. Her face is aglow with pleasure as she
admires herself in the mirror. The Saleswoman checks the fit.

SALESWOMAN
It'll need a couple of alterations in the
bust. We can do them here.

EDWARD
We need them done now. I'm taking her to
Aida in San Francisco tonight.

The Saleswoman purrs in Vivian's ear.

SALESWOMAN
Oh, you're so lucky. It's supposed to be
fabulous.

INT. MERCEDES - DAY

Edward is talking on his car phone. Vivian sits happily next to
him, admiring her new dress.

EDWARD

(to the phone)
Bill, Bill, stop panicking. I'll read the
contracts on the plane. Just have the
brokerage arrange the flights for me.
Kross isn't going anywhere. I don't need
to watch the stocks go down today. Have
it ready. I'll make a couple more stops
and be there in an hour or two. âBye.

Vivian looks over at Edward, still reeling from all the attention
he is giving her.
87
VIVIAN
Are you sure this is alright? I don't
want you to hurt your business.

EDWARD
(with mock drama)
My empire may crumble through neglect, but
it's worth it. I've been meaning to see
Aida before it closes and now I have a
good excuse. But you must be freezing in
that skimpy thing.

VIVIAN
I'm okay.

EDWARD
No, no. You're bound to catch pneumonia
if we don't do something.

INT. FURRIER - DAY

Vivian stands wrapped up in a grey mink coat. She rubs the fur
against her cheek in ecstasy. Edward sits near her, watching.

VIVIAN
It's so soft.

A handsome young SALESMAN stands by her side, his arms
overflowing with other coats. He looks to Edward for approval.

EDWARD
Nice, but not what I had in mind. We're
only going to rent it for a few days, so we
might as well get something really special.

SALESMAN
I have just the thing.

He exits into the back room. Vivian looks at Edward pleadingly.

VIVIAN
I like this one.

EDWARD
Vivian, trust me, I know furs. I'm going
to find you one that will give you
multiple orgasms.

The Salesman comes out carrying a long, stark-white fur coat.
Vivian's eyes widen. The Salesman hands it to Edward.
88

SALESMAN
Baby seal, very rare. You can't get them
any more. Normally I wouldn't even consider
renting it. But for you, Mr. Harris...

Edward nods. He stands up and strides to Vivian's side. The
Salesman helps Vivian out of the mink and steps back. Edward
slides the coat over Vivian's arms. He wraps it around her body
and gives her a kiss. Vivian melts.

VIVIAN
(whispering in Edward's ear)
I think I'm coming.

SALESMAN
(loudly)
Of course, if you do decide to purchase it
later, I'll deduct the rental fees from
the total cost.

Edward glances sideways at the Salesman.

EDWARD
Don't get your hopes up, Frank. We're
just renting it for the opera.

INT. SHOE STORE - DAY

ANOTHER SALESMAN fits Vivian with a pair of red high heel shoes.
Edward sits next to her. He leans over and whispers in her ear.

EDWARD
Feel like Cinderella yet?

Vivian nods happily.

INT. BROKERAGE - NIGHT

Edward, dashing in his tuxedo, escorts Vivian by the hand down a
long hallway as William trails after. Vivian, balancing on high
heels, is having trouble keeping up with him on the slippery
marble floors.

WILLIAM
Please, at least think about it. It's a
gold mine. You're the one who thought it
up.
89
EDWARD
Bill, I don't want to get into the toxic
waste business. What a nightmare! I just
want to sell the rights to the highest
bidder. Let them do the dirty work. Those
processing licenses must be worth a fortune.

WILLIAM
But not half as much as if we use them
ourselves.

Edward stops suddenly and turns toward William. Vivian skids and
almost falls; she grabs Edward's shoulder for balance. Edward,
ignoring her, looks down at William like a teacher lecturing a
slow student.

EDWARD
Bill. Cash, leverage, acquire. Cash,
leverage, acquire. Cash, leverage,
acquire. Got it?

WILLIAM
Okay, okay. I got it.

Edward slaps William on the shoulder and drags Vivian off.
WILLIAM
Enjoy the opera! Read the contracts!
EXT. HELIPORT - DAY

Vivian and Edward come out onto the roof and make their way to a
waiting helicopter.

Once they are inside, the helicopter takes off.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Vivian looks out the window as the âcopter flies over the city.
She squeezes Edward's hand.

VIVIAN
It's like a dream.

Edward smiles absently as he reads through some papers.

EXT. HELIPORT AT BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

 

Edward and Vivian climb out of the helicopter and make their way
from the landing pad.

A PILOT in a leather jacket and dark sunglasses greets them.
90

PILOT
Mr. Harris?

EDWARD
Yes.

PILOT

Your plane is ready to go, sir.

EXT. HELIPORT AT BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

 

A small corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.

INT. JET - DAY

Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet.
It is a comfortable room featuring a long couch that curves
across two walls, built-in bar, television and stereo. Edward
sorts through a pile of contracts. Vivian looks at herself ina
small mirror. Her hair is wild and loose from the helicopter.

VIVIAN
Good thing I didn't have my hair done.

EDWARD
Oh, I should have warned you. Cindy won't
even let me get her near a helicopter.

VIVIAN
I can fix it.

EDWARD
Good, now be quiet while I read these.

Vivian smiles wickedly and fluffs her hair up. She takes her fur
off and lays it down on the floor. She walks over to Edward and
slides into his lap. She starts to kiss his neck.

Edward, grinning, pushes her away gently.

EDWARD
Go away.

Vivian, undaunted, slides the straps of her dress off her
shoulders. She stands and it falls to the floor. Wearing only a
pair of red panties, she lies down on the fur coat.

EDWARD
What are you doing?

Vivian gives Edward her finest come-hither look.

VIVIAN
Being quiet.
91
Edward sets down his papers.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUNSET

The sun is just beginning to set as the jet makes a slow pass
over the city and heads for the airport.

INT. JET - DAY

Vivian, naked, stares out the window at the city lights twinkling
below. Her eyes are full of wonder.

VIVIAN
I can see the bridge. It's all lit up.
It's so beautiful.

Edward studies a contract. Without glancing up he speaks to her.

EDWARD
You'd better put on your clothes, now. I
don't want to give the pilot a thrill.

Vivian reaches down and picks up her red dress.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

 

An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco
Opera House. The DRIVER walks around back and opens the
passenger door. Edward emerges and helps the fur-wrapped Vivian
out.

They walk toward the Opera House past a beautifully lit fountain
with several graceful statues in its center. Edward has his hand
on Vivian's elbow as they talk.

EDWARD
Some people say that opera is an acquired
taste -- that's why everyone prefers
movies -- but I don't believe it. It's

something you're born to. But I don't
mean that in an elitist sense. Highborn,
lowborn, you can always tell when someone
goes to the opera for the first time.
Some love it, some hate it. Those who
love it will always love it; those who
hate it might force themselves to
appreciate it, but they'll never love it.
Maybe there's an opera gene in a person's
DNA. It'll be interesting to see how you
react.
92

VIVIAN
Even if I hate it, I'm glad you brought
me.

EDWARD
So am I.

INT. OPERA LOBBY - NIGHT

A crowd of well-dressed PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading
toward the theater. Vivian admires the pretty dresses around
her.

INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

Edward and Vivian sit front row center on the first balcony.
They hold programs while they wait for the curtain. Vivian leans
over to Edward and speaks in a low voice.

VIVIAN
If it's in Italian, how will I know what
they're saying?

EDWARD
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the
story for you. But you'll be surprised at
how much you'll understand by the way they
sing. The music conveys their emotions
more powerfully than any words.

The orchestra begins.
MONTAGE OF OPERA

When the lights dim and the opera is performed, we do not shift
to the stage but rather stay on Vivian.

As the music builds and the changing stage lights dance across

her face we see the opera unfold only through her eyes. As we
DISSOLVE from close-up to close-up, Edward occasionally leans
over and whispers intimately into her ear.

EDWARD
Radames is desperately in love with Aida,
amere slave. Yet he is forced to marry
Amneris, the King's daughter.

The music continues. Vivian's face focuses intensely on the
stage, as if a new world is being revealed to her. Edward leans
toward her ear.

EDWARD
Here he tells Aida how much loves her but...
93

Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth. She nods,
eyes fixed on the stage. She understands what is happening.

As Vivian's hand slowly lowers, Edward glances at her, pleased.
He takes her hand and gently strokes her fingers.

Vivian concentrates on what is happening. The music is reaching
its tragic climax. The emotions building inside Vivian swell.
As the opera ends, she is profoundly moved. A single tear rolls
down her cheek.

INT. STAIRCASE / OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

 

Vivian and Edward stand at the top of an elegant staircase
leading down from the balcony. Vivian is slightly swaying as if
weak. Edward has a firm arm around her shoulder.

EDWARD
Are you alright? Can you make it down the
stairs?

VIVIAN

I just stood up too fast. My head is
spinning. The blood all went to my legs.
Just a second.

Edward holds her tightly as other patrons move past them and down
the stairs. Edward smiles smugly at her.

EDWARD
You liked the opera, didn't you?

Vivian nods.

VIVIAN
Yeah. It was.. I liked it so much. It...
was sad.

As she thinks about it, she feels the urge to cry again. She
fights it.

VIVIAN
I'm okay now.

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Vivian is lying across the lounge couch with her head on Edward's
lap. Edward strokes her hair. Tears are streaming from her
eyes.

EDWARD
You're such an emotional little creature.
94

VIVIAN
(defensively)

It was sad.
EDWARD

I know. But I took you to make you happy,
not to make you cry.

VIVIAN
I'm happy. Just sad happy is all.

EDWARD
You've been crying for an hour.

Vivian wipes her eyes.

VIVIAN
I just.. I'm kinda used to smoking whenever
I get sad, you know? It keeps me feeling
good. I'm not used to being off it.

EDWARD
I'm sorry if that's been tough on you.

VIVIAN
No, no. It's okay. It's just like I'm
feeling all sorts of strange things. It's
kinda nice in a way. I just have trouble
handling it sometimes.

EDWARD
Well, the day after tomorrow I'm off to
New York and you can do whatever you want.
And you'll have some money to do it with.

VIVIAN
Yeah.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edward is sound asleep. Vivian stares off into the darkness.
She can't sleep.

She crawls out of bed. She is wearing a pink teddy. Edward

stirs.

He blinks his eyes.

EDWARD
What's the matter?

VIVIAN
Noth'n. Just can't sleep.

EDWARD
Oh.
95

VIVIAN
Can I get some champagne? Maybe it'll
help me sleep.

EDWARD
Sure. Let me call --

He pulls himself up with difficulty.

VIVIAN
No, no. I can call. You sleep. I'm
alright. Really.

Edward lies back down.
EDWARD
(sleepily)
Okay. Order whatever you want.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Vivian sits alone on the living room floor staring out the
windows into the city. She is dressed in her pink teddy with the
white fur wrapped around her shoulders. She sips straight from
the bottle of champagne.

She hums a tune from the opera.

She takes a long drink and rearranges the bottom of the fur over
her legs for warmth.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Edward is dressed in his robe talking on the phone as he looks
over the morning breakfast on the dining table.

EDWARD
Jesus that was fast. What did you do?
Put a horse head in his bed?

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - MORNING

A Secretary hands William a cup of coffee. He takes a sip.
96
WILLIAM

(on the phone)
Very funny. I barely did anything. The
old coot must be more desperate than
either of us thought. He said he wouldn't
talk to me about specifics until after our
thirty day filing period. But he wants to
talk to you. Get assurances that you're
both on the same side or something. Maybe
get you to call off the dogs, i.e., me.

He takes another sip of his coffee. He waves the Secretary off.
She exits.

WILLIAM
Anyhow, I told him that I might be able to
arrange for you to see him this morning at
your hotel room. What I'd like you to do
is butter him up and then drag him here so
I can grill him.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Edward is sipping orange juice.

EDWARD
You're such a sneaky fucker.

WILLIAM
The guy's pathetic. All you have to do is
take him by the hand and bring him over.
If we could just get him to tell us the
story on the Navy repair commitments it
would be worth it.

Edward glances at his watch.

EDWARD
Alright. Tell him ten-thirty.

WILLIAM
He'll be there.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Vivian is passed out in the bed. Edward comes in and undoes his
robe. He starts to put on a suit.

EDWARD
Wake up, sleeping beauty.

Vivian stirs. She blinks at Edward with sleepy red eyes.
97

VIVIAN
What?

EDWARD
Put on some clothes. We're about to have
a guest.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Vivian, wearing her yellow dress, does Edward's tie for him.

EDWARD
You sure you don't mind? I wouldn't want
you to get mad at me again.

VIVIAN
No, it's okay. I didn't mean it. I like
tying it.

She finishes. Edward checks it in the mirror.

EDWARD
Pattern in the center. Perfect. That's
lovely.

He gives her a peck on the cheek. We hear the doorbell ring from
the living room.

EDWARD
Well, here we go.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian stands near the bedroom as Edward opens the front door.
Mr. Kross slowly enters. He looks old and tired. They shake
hands and Edward closes the door behind him.

EDWARD
Mr. Kross.

KROSS
Mr. Harris.

Edward leads him down the stairs.

EDWARD
Have a seat.

KROSS
I can't stay very long.

Kross notices Vivian standing across the room. He seems
surprised to see her. Surprised and bothered. He nods to her.
98

KROSS
Young lady.

VIVIAN
Hi.

The both seem uncomfortable in each other's presence. Like
former lovers who run into each other by surprise in public.
Kross immediately turns his eyes away from her. He looks at
Edward.

KROSS
I'll get to the point. As I said earlier
today to your lawyer, I've reconsidered my
position on your expected acquisition
offer. After the filing period is over,
I'1l recommend to the board that we accept
your bid.

EDWARD
Excellent. I'm sure that will be the best
for everyone.

KROSS
And the other night... I want to apologize
for...

EDWARD

There is nothing to apologize for. It's
just business.

Kross's hands are trembling. He glances nervously at Vivian and
then back at Edward.

KROSS
Yes. Business.

Vivian is disturbed watching this broken man. She backs away
into the bedroom and disappears.

KROSS
That's all. I just wanted to tell you my
decision in person.

EDWARD
I appreciate that. And I'm sure things
will go well for you.

KROSS
Thank you. I'd better be going.
99
EDWARD
Perhaps you could do me one favor though.
If you could take an hour to accompany me
down to my brokerage and have a brief talk
with my lawyer. Just answer a couple
questions.

KROSS
I don't think that's quite proper at this
time. Maybe after the filing period.

EDWARD
Let me be completely up front with you,
Mr. Kross. We're preparing our bid now.
That bid is based on our speculation of
the corporation's net worth. The more we
know the higher our bid can be. And since
you do own a fair block of shares...

KROSS
Â«It's in my best interest to cooperate.

EDWARD
We might even be able to strike a special
deal with you on your shares.

Kross looks at Edward with a weak smile.

KROSS
I throw myself on my sword, and you
promise to take care of my family.

Edward stares at Kross evenly.

EDWARD
It doesn't have to be that way.

KROSS
Alright. I'1l answer your questions.
Whatever you want.

EDWARD
Good. Vivian --

Edward notices for the first time that Vivian has left the room.

EDWARD
Excuse me for one second.

He heads to the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Vivian is sitting on the bed as Edward comes in. He closes the
door behind him.
EDWARD
Why'd you run off?

Vivian stares at her feet.

VIVIAN
Just... no reason.

EDWARD
Very well. I'm going to be gone all day.
I don't think I'll be back in time for
dinner so go ahead and eat. Alright?

Vivian looks up at Edward.

VIVIAN
What did you do to him?
EDWARD
What do you mean?
VIVIAN
Why is he afraid of you? What did you do

to him?

Edward is silent for a long while. He doesn't like this
question.

EDWARD
I don't think you need to worry about
things like that.

VIVIAN
(almost to herself)
Last time I saw him he was so strong. Now
he's so scared.

EDWARD
(firmly)
The man made a business decision. That's
all. I make business decisions; you make
business decisions. Nobody does anything
unless it's in their own best interest.

Vivian stares at her feet and says nothing. Edward watches
He turns and leaves.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Edward crosses the living room to Kross.

EDWARD
Everything's fine. Let's go.

100

her.
101
EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DAY

It's a cold cloudy day. Vivian stands in front of the hotel in
her mink coat, smoking a cigarette. She watches the cars passing
by, thinking.

An old yellow Mustang passes. She takes a last drag and tosses
her cigarette butt into the gutter.

She turns and goes back into the hotel.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
Vivian walks up to the front desk and addresses the DESK CLERK.

VIVIAN
Is there a phone I can use? I want to
call a cab.

DESK CLERK
You may use this phone.

He pulls a phone from under the desk. Mr. Thomas enters from the
back door. He smiles at Vivian.

MR. THOMAS
Miss Vivian.

VIVIAN
Hi. What's the number of a cab company?

MR. THOMAS
Where are you going?

VIVIAN
Umm... Hollywood like. I need to get some
medicine. You know, for headaches.

MR. THOMAS
Why don't you use one of the hotel's
limousines?

VIVIAN
Limo?

MR. THOMAS

Of course. A small perk for the guests in
our better rooms.

Vivian thinks about that for a moment. She kind of likes the
idea, but it also makes her nervous.

VIVIAN
Umm.. I don't want Edward to know I'm
leaving. He.. I just don't want...
102
MR. THOMAS
Discretion is our middle name here at the
Beverly Wilshire.

EXT. LIMO - DAY

A long black limo drives into Hollywood.

INT. LIMO - DAY

Vivian sits alone in the back of the limo, enjoying the ride.
There is a phone and a tiny television set and a small stereo
system. She examines each carefully and plays with the knobs.

DRIVER'S VOICE
(from a small speaker)
Is this the street, ma'am?

Vivian presses the intercom button.
VIVIAN
Yes. 1312. It's a big apartment building.

EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

 

The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment building
on a dirty Hollywood side street.

The LIMO DRIVER, a large Latino man, steps out of the car and
walks around to the passenger door. As he does, he surveys the
surroundings uncomfortably. This is a rough neighborhood.

He opens the door. Vivian steps out, fur and all.

LIMO DRIVER
Are you sure this is the right place, ma'am?

VIVIAN
Yeah.

LIMO DRIVER
Maybe I should go with you. This doesn't
look like a good place for a lady to be
alone.

Vivian is suddenly aware of how much her appearance has changed.
She draws the fur around herself a little nervously.

VIVIAN
I'll be okay. It'll just be a second.

LIMO DRIVER
You sure, ma'am?
103

VIVIAN
Yeah.

She hurries up the steps to the apartment building. The Driver
unhappily watches her go.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Vivian's bright new shoes and white fur traverse the grimy dark
carpeted hallways. Cockroaches scurry along the edges of the
walls.

Vivian reaches the door to her apartment. She turns the knob.
It opens.

INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Vivian's apartment is small and claustrophobic. The walls are a
dingy faded yellow and plaster is falling from the ceiling.

There are a couple of worn-out overstuffed chairs and a bookcase
piled with everything but books. The majority of the room is
given over to a large bed that is folded out of a couch. A large
mangy pile of old blankets and pillows cover it.

As Vivian enters from the hallway she whispers.

VIVIAN
Kit? Kit? You here?

She blinks into the dim room and waits for an answer. There is
none. It is clear from Vivian's face that she is glad no one is
home. She closes the door behind her.

She moves to a small wooden box on the bookshelf and opens it.
Inside is various drug paraphernalia, but no drugs. She closes
it, annoyed.

KIT
Viv?

Startled, Vivian spins and sees Kit staring at her from under the
blankets on the bed. Her face is pale and ghostly. Her voice is
hoarse.

VIVIAN
Jesus, you scared me. I didn't see you
under there. Why didn't you answer me?

KIT
I was waking up. I'm not feeling too
good.

VIVIAN

You never feel good.
104
KIT
That's a pretty coat. Did your date give
you that coat?

VIVIAN
No, it's just rented.

KIT
Those are pretty shoes.

VIVIAN
Yeah. Well, I can't stay very long. I
got to go back.

KIT
You aren't home yet?

VIVIAN
No, not till tomorrow. I just wanted some
rock. Is there any?

KIT
No. I smoked it all. But we could go get
some if you have money.

Kit sits up. She wears a sleeveless undershirt that exposes her
unhealthily thin and pale arms. Vivian stares at her unhappily.

VIVIAN
Fuck, you look like hell. Haven't you
been eating?

KIT
I didn't have any money.

VIVIAN
You have to work, babe. Besides, there's
food in the kitchen.

Kit coughs hard.

KIT
I didn't feel like it. I just haven't
been hungry.

VIVIAN
You have to eat. No wonder you don't feel
good. Goddamn it.

Vivian stands restlessly, overcome with both guilt and revulsion.

VIVIAN
You're such a fucking baby.

She pulls off her coat and flings it onto a chair. She marches
into the kitchen alcove.
105
INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Vivian's kitchen is piled with dirty dishes, old open cans and
various food boxes. Vivian pours a can of chicken soup into a
small saucepan on a tiny electric skillet.

KIT (0.S.)
What you doing, Viv?

VIVIAN
I'm making you some soup, dammit. You
have to eat. You want onions in it?

KIT (0.S.)
I'd like that.

Vivian gets a small white onion from the refrigerator and chops
it with a large butcher knife. She throws the onion into the
soup.

INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Vivian comes out carrying a bowl of hot soup with a spoon in it.
As she stands in front of Kit for a moment we almost get the
impression that she might throw it at her. Instead, she sets it
down roughly on the bed.

Kit starts to sip the soup. Vivian paces around the room
restlessly. She moves to the window and opens it.

VIVIAN
God it stinks in here. Why didn't you
open the window?

KIT
It's cold.

Kit sips the soup.

KIT
This is good. I feel better already.

VIVIAN
I'm not your fucking mother.

KIT
I'm sorry. I've just felt lonely. You
want to go get some rock?

VIVIAN
No, I got to go. I've got a car waiting
for me. I shouldn't smoke anyway while
I'm working.
106
KIT

You sure look pretty. That guy must be
treating you real good. Is he nice?

VIVIAN
He's alright.

KIT
He must like you a lot to want you around
for so long. He sure must like you.

VIVIAN
Yeah... well, he likes to fuck me.
KIT
He buys you nice things.
VIVIAN
Yeah.
Kit coughs again.
KIT
Maybe you should stay with him, Viv.
VIVIAN
(nervously)

What are you, nuts? The guy's rich. Don't
you know anything? He can have any girl he
wants. He has a high class fuck in New

York. Rich guys don't go for street girls.

KIT
Why'd he pick you up?

VIVIAN
It was a mistake.
(softly)
He was lost. He just wants me till
tomorrow.

KIT
Maybe he'll ask you to stay with him.

Vivian doesn't like to think about that. She turns away.

VIVIAN
No.

KIT
Don't worry about me, Viv. I'll be okay.
I can always get by. You should stay with
him. You look so pretty. I bet if you
asked him he'd want to keep you.
107

VIVIAN
God are you stupid. He's just a date.
That's all.
(beat)

I got to go.

She grabs her coat and puts it on. She walks to the door and
stands for a moment, uncomfortable, guilty. She pulls some money
out of her coat pocket.

VIVIAN

Here's twenty. Hell, forty. Don't spend
it all on rock. Get some food tonight,
okay? You're gonna get sick if you don't
keep eating.

(beat)
I.. don't know exactly what time I'll be
back tomorrow, so don't wait for me or
anything.

She sets two twenty dollar bills on the bookcase. Kit and Vivian
stare at each other silently for a moment. In Vivian's hand is
the rest of her money. She looks down at it.

VIVIAN
Yeah. And.. I'm gonna stash some of this
here. I got it the first night with him.

She opens an empty jar of cold cream and stashes most of the
money inside.

VIVIAN
Don't you touch that money... I'll count it
when I get back...

Vivian walks to the door and hesitates again. Kit looks at her
sadly.

KIT
You're not coming back, are you?

Vivian tries to stay something but chokes on the words. She
takes a deep breath.

VIVIAN
I'll be back, babe.
(pause)
You know what? When I get back we'll go
to Disneyland. Take a bus. Would you
like that? I'1l have lots of money.

KIT
That would be fun.
108

VIVIAN
We'll go on that Space Mountain ride. You
like that?

KIT

I like Small World with all the dolls and
the little boats.

VIVIAN
We'll go on everything. It'll be fun.

Vivian opens the door and steps outside.

KIT
I think you should stay with him, Viv.

Vivian grits her teeth.

VIVIAN
You're so fucking stupid! Just shut up!
I'll be back tomorrow.

She exits and closes the door behind her.

EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

 

Vivian comes quickly out of the apartment building and heads for
the limo. The Driver opens the door for her.

LIMO DRIVER
I was getting worried.

VIVIAN
I'm fine. Just take me back.

INT. LIMO - DAY

Vivian sits in the back of the limo. She is calmer now. She
leans back in her seat and wraps the fur tightly around herself.

INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY

Edward and William stand in front of a conference table staring
at a large flowchart of their acquisition and liquidation of
Kross Enterprises.

WILLIAM
Well, that's about it. Thirty, sixty
days. Six months. One year. After that,
Kross is just naval history.

EDWARD
You really think we can scam all the
pension funds off on P.B.G.?
109

WILLIAM
Hey, '78 was a great year.

He starts to roll up the charts.

WILLIAM
The only question in my mind is what are
you going to go after next.

EDWARD
(smugly)
North American Steel.

WILLIAM
You're dreaming.

Jake comes into the room.

JAKE
Your helicopter's ready, Mr. Harris.

WILLIAM
(glancing sideways at Edward)
Helicopter? Going to the opera again?

EDWARD
I just want another look at the shipyards.
Before I go back to New York.

WILLIAM
You're such a sentimental softy.

EDWARD
Why don't you come with me?

WILLIAM
No. I want to finish that chemical bid so
you can take it back to New York.

EDWARD
You can always FedEx it later.

WILLIAM
No, you know me. I don't like loose ends.

INT. BROKERAGE HALLWAY - DAY
Jake escorts Edward down the hallway.

JAKE
So, did you learn a lot from Mr. Kross?

EDWARD
Who? Oh, no. Not really. We already
knew it all.
110
EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Edward is sitting comfortably in the helicopter as it passes over
the decaying shipyards. He stares down at them thoughtfully.
INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Vivian is standing in front of the glass windows, looking out at
the city, drinking a glass of champagne. The doorbell rings.
Startled, she spills some champagne on her hand. She turns and
looks at the door, edgy. It rings again.

Licking the champagne from her hand, she walks across the room
and up the stairs to the door. She opens it.

William is standing outside with a small briefcase.

WILLIAM
Hello again.
VIVIAN
(nervously)
Hi.
WILLIAM

I take it Edward isn't back from his
little helicopter trip?

VIVIAN
No.

They wait quietly for a moment, Vivian expecting him to leave and
William standing firm.

WILLIAM
May I come in?

VIVIAN
Oh, yeah, sure.

William walks past her and down the steps into the living room.
He spots the open bottle of champagne and strolls over to it.

WILLIAM
You like drinking alone?

VIVIAN
Sometimes.

William picks up a glass.

WILLIAM
Do you mind?
111

Vivian is obviously uncomfortable in his presence, but she
doesn't feel like she can refuse.

VIVIAN
No.

William sets his briefcase down on the table and pours a full
glass. He takes a sip.

WILLIAM
It's been a long day.
(pause)
You know Edward's leaving tomorrow. Don't
you?

VIVIAN
Yeah.

William takes another sip. He opens his briefcase and takes out
a small stack of papers.

WILLIAM
I'm going to leave some papers here for
him to take back to New York.

He sets the papers down on the table and closes the briefcase.
He walks over to the window and looks out. He takes another sip.

WILLIAM
Great view. Lord Harris sure knows how to
live, doesn't he?

VIVIAN
Lord Harris?

WILLIAM
Just a joke. Between me and Ed. This
must be quite a change for a hooker off
the boulevard.

Vivian says nothing. William takes a long drink and goes back to
the bottle for a refill. He stares at Vivian.

WILLIAM
You're a very pretty girl, Vivian. Too
pretty for the street.

Vivian is silent. William stalks closer to her. He takes a sip.

WILLIAM
What do you make a week? Five hundred?
Even that?

Vivian's tone of voice suddenly becomes hostile.
VIVIAN
What's it to you?

WILLIAM

With the right manager you could make a lot

of money. More than Edward's giving you.
Much more than you can make on the street.

VIVIAN
I don't like managers. I don't like
people making money off me.

William smiles.

WILLIAM
You've got a mean streak in you. Don't
you? Maybe that's what Edward liked about
you.

He takes a sip and turns away.

WILLIAM
There's nothing to get hostile about. I
have some friends who run a nice service.
They aren't like the pimps you find on the
street. They don't muscle you. They just
help you. Sure, they take a cut, but
since you're making a lot more money you
won't even think about it.

VIVIAN
Yeah, they take their cut. Then they sell
you their shitty overpriced dope. Then
they rent you their places... they let you
use one of their cars. Then they tell you
they need a bigger cut, and the dope costs
more too. But don't worry, they'll lend
you the money till your next job. Yeah,
they'll help you. They'll help fuck you.
Well, no thanks. I only want to get
fucked by one person at a time.

112

William's face sours. He downs his champagne quickly and sets

the glass down on the table. Obviously straining to keep

voice calm, he turns to Vivian.

WILLIAM
How long have you been on the street,
Vivian?
VIVIAN
(quietly)

Five years.

his
113

WILLIAM
I read in the paper once that the average
life expectancy for a street hooker was
twenty-seven.

VIVIAN
I don't read the paper.

WILLIAM
Don't you like it here? You got your
champagne, your nice Rodeo Drive dresses,
your view. Isn't this nice?

Vivian says nothing. She turns away from him.

WILLIAM
What are you going to do when Edward's
finished with you? Go back to the street?
You're too pretty for that. You're just
wasting yourself. A couple years fucking
niggers and drug pushers and your face
will be ruined.

VIVIAN
Just get out of here.
(desperately)
Does Edward want you here? I don't think
he'd like it if you were talking to me
like this.

William half laughs.

WILLIAM

Edward? Oh, now I get it. It's starting
to make sense. You don't think Edward's
going to get rid of you, do you? What do
you think? You think Edward's going to
keep you?

(intensely)
Don't you know what a cold bastard he is?
He's not going to keep you.

VIVIAN
(yelling)
I know!

WILLIAM
(angrily)
Then what's your problem? I'm trying to
help you!

Vivian spins and stares at him furiously.
114

VIVIAN
I don't want your help! I don't like you.
I'd rather fuck niggers and drug pushers
than fuck you!

William slaps her hard across the face.

WILLIAM
Don't talk to me like that, whore.

Vivian buckles over, holding her face in pain. William stares at
her, seething.

WILLIAM
Fine. Go back to the street. End up dead
in a dumpster. What do I care.

He turns to start to leave, but as he does Vivian leaps at him,
pounding him from behind.

William turns and slaps her hard again. He slaps her again.
Vivian keeps punching him.

VIVIAN
You fucker! You fucker!

In the background, Edward opens the door and enters the room. He
sees the two of them fighting. For a moment is he confused, but
then he hurries down the steps and runs to them.

EDWARD
Cut it out! What's going on?!

Vivian roughly claws William with her fingernails. Edward pulls
her away from him.

William, blood dripping from his cheek, lunges at her and slaps
her again.

Edward intervenes. He punches William hard in the stomach.
William buckles over in pain. Edward pulls Vivian further away
and lets go of her.

As Edward moves toward William, William straightens with an angry
look on his face.

WILLIAM
That little bitch!

William is about to rush toward Vivian again when Edward slugs
him square on the chin. William stops cold and sways in dizzied
pain.

Edward grabs him by the shoulder and hauls him up the steps to
the front door. William, dazed, doesn't resist.
115

Edward shoves him out into the hallway. He follows after and
closes the door.

Vivian stands alone, stunned, holding her face in pain.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Edward roughly throws William up against the wall.

EDWARD
What the fuck are you doing?

William grits his teeth.

WILLIAM
That's some nasty little cunt you found.

EDWARD
Yeah, I kind of like her. What the fuck
were you doing with her?

WILLIAM
I came to drop off some papers and she
started pissing me off.

EDWARD
Why? Did you make a pass at her?
WILLIAM
No.
EDWARD
Well, whatever it was, you look pretty
stupid.

He takes William by the chin and turns his head so that he can
see the cut from Vivian's nails.

WILLIAM
Yeah, I feel pretty stupid. Nice right
hook you got.

Edward smiles and pats William on the shoulder.

EDWARD
So, what'd you bring me?

WILLIAM
The treatment license bid. Try to read it
by next week.

EDWARD
I'd invite you in for a drink, but I don't
think it would be a good idea.
116
WILLIAM
No. That's alright.
(grinning)
I need to go get a tetanus shot.

He wipes the blood from his face with a handkerchief.

WILLIAM
Oh, I need my briefcase. If you would be
so kind...

Edward nods. He opens the doors and goes back into the room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Edward comes down the steps and crosses to the dining table. He
snatches up William's briefcase.

Vivian is sitting on the couch, motionless.

Edward walks up the steps and tosses the briefcase out to
William.

WILLIAM
Have a nice trip tomorrow.

EDWARD
I will.

Edward closes the doors. He turns and looks at Vivian. She
seems frozen. Edward walks to the couch and sits next to her.

EDWARD
You alright?

Vivian speaks with an icily calm voice.

VIVIAN
Why do guys always know how to hit a girl?
Wham, right across the cheek. Nice and high
so it feels like your eye is going to
explode. Pimps, cops, even little asshole
lawyers in suits and ties. They all hit you
the same. What do they do, take all the
boys aside in high school and show them how?

EDWARD
No one's going to hit you anymore.

VIVIAN
Nobody needs to. He already did a good
enough job.
117
EDWARD

I'm sorry about that. I don't know what
got into him.

Vivian slowly stands up.

VIVIAN
I'd better go.

EDWARD
Go? You don't have to go. You didn't do
anything wrong. I kicked Bill out. We've
still got one night together.

VIVIAN
No. I want to go. I hate it here. I
want to go home.

Edward stands.

EDWARD
Alright. I understand.

Edward reaches into this jacket and pulls out a long gray
envelope.

EDWARD
Here. I was going to give you this
tomorrow, but I'll give it to you now.
It's three thousand.

He holds it out to her, Vivian doesn't take it.

VIVIAN
You can take out five hundred for tonight.

Edward takes her hand and puts the envelope in it. He closes her
fingers around it.

EDWARD
Don't be silly. Take it all. I may be
petty about money, but I'm not that petty.
You earned it.
(beat)
I'm sorry about what happened. I'm sorry
you won't stay, but I understand.

Vivian stares down at the envelope. Her eyes moisten.

VIVIAN
You're the nicest guy I've ever known.

EDWARD
Then stay.
118

VIVIAN
I don't know.

EDWARD
Stay tonight. Not for the money. Not
because you have to. Stay because you
want to.

He takes her chin in his hand and kisses her on the lips. As he
pulls back we can see Vivian debating.

VIVIAN
I don't know. I just.. don't think so. My
face hurts real bad and I don't feel so
good. It's starting to swell up.

EDWARD
We don't have to make love. You can just
sleep here and have breakfast in the
morning. Then I'll get you a cab before I
go to the airport.

VIVIAN
I am kind of tired.

EDWARD
Then stay.

Vivian nods. She carefully sets the envelope down on the coffee
table.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the darkened bedroom Vivian and Edward lie together. Edward
sleeps deeply, peacefully with Vivian's back cuddled in close to
his chest, his arm over her body.

Vivian, her face swollen and puffy from the blow she received,
stares into space, sleepless.

She takes Edward's limp hand in her hands and carefully examines
it. The fingers, the palm, the tiny hairs on the back. She
pulls it in close to her body and holds it tightly. She kisses
the fingers. In a low, barely audible voice she says:

VIVIAN
I... love you.

Almost as if she wanted to hear what it sounded like.
119

Edward stirs a little but continues to sleep. Vivian stares off
again, her eyes filled with desperate longing. What she has said
to a sleeping hand she would never dare say to his face. She
knows only too well that his reply would not be "I love you too."
There is nothing she can offer this man. Nothing that would hold
him. Yet there is an emptiness inside her this night that she
cannot bear. If she cannot have his lasting love, at least she
could have a moment of company.

She rolls over and starts to kiss him. Edward stirs.

EDWARD
What? Go back to sleep.

She continues to kiss him, rubbing her hands over his body.

VIVIAN
Make love to me. Make love to me, please.

Edward sighs and smiles sleepily. He returns her kisses.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Edward, fully dressed in a suit, is packing his bags. Vivian,
dressed in her pink outfit, fingers her clothes in the closet.
She has a nasty blue and purple bruise across her cheek and under
her eye. It is concealed with makeup, but with little success.

Edward is the model of a hurried businessman preparing for his
return trip.

EDWARD
We're running a little behind. I have to
be at L.A.X. in two hours.

He looks over at Vivian who is staring forlornly at her clothes.
He tries to understand why she looks so sad.

EDWARD

What's the matter?
VIVIAN

Did.. did you want to take these back?
EDWARD

Of course not. They're yours. Pack them

up.
Vivian smiles. Edward turns and closes his suitcase.

EDWARD
Except the fur, of course. That's rented.

Vivian pauses. She glances at the beautiful fur coat hanging on
the rack.
120

EDWARD
Damn, I forgot all about that thing. I've
got to send it back before I go to the
airport. Bring it along as we go down.

Vivian pulls the fur from the hanger. From her eyes we can tell
that it is going to be very difficult for her to part with it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Edward carries his suitcases into the living room. He sets them
down and picks up the phone. He dials the lobby.

EDWARD
Could I have a bellboy come up and help me
with some bags. Yes. Penthouse.

He sets the phone down. Vivian comes into the room, carrying a
few narrow clothes boxes which she has packed her things into.
Lying on top of them is the fur.

EDWARD
When the bellboy comes I'1l ask him to get
you a cab, or...

Vivian stands emotionlessly, the boxes clutched tightly in her
arms. Edward is debating something.

EDWARD
Oh, what the hell. You want me to give
you a ride? Would that be better than a
taxi?

VIVIAN
(quietly)
I don't want to make you late.

EDWARD
I think we have time. I'11l just drop the
car off at the airport and take the plane.
The tickets are reserved. Yes, let's do it
that way. I can drop off the fur on the
way.

The doorbell rings.

EDWARD
Come in!

A BELLBOY comes in pushing a small cart. Edward points at his
bags and the Bellboy goes to pick them up.
121
As the Bellboy loads everything onto the cart Edward glances
around the room to see if anything has been left. He notices the
envelope with the money in it. He picks it up and puts it in his
jacket.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

As the elevator opens the Bellboy emerges with Edward's and
Vivian's bags. Edward strides to the main desk. Vivian stands
in the lobby, a small figure holding a fur coat in her arms. She
looks around the room, taking it all in for one last time.

Edward hands his keys to the Clerk.

EDWARD
Is everything taken care of?

CLERK
Yes sir, I believe so. Let me just check
the phone bill.

Edward stands impatiently.

Mr. Thomas, on patrol through the lobby, sees Vivian and moves
toward her.

MR. THOMAS
Well, today's the day. I'11l miss you,
Miss Vivian. I hope you had a nice stay.

Vivian is nervous and edgy.

VIVIAN
Oh, yes. It was nice.

MR. THOMAS
So you'll be going to New York with Mr.
Harris?

VIVIAN

No. Back home. Hollywood.

MR. THOMAS
Oh.

He notices the bruise on her face.

MR. THOMAS
(concerned)
Where did you get that bruise?

Vivian touches her face guiltily.
122

VIVIAN
Oh. I bumped into something. Isn't that
dumb?

Mr. Thomas sees through this obvious lie. Vivian is shaking

nervously.

MR. THOMAS
You're trembling. Is there anything the
matter? Can I help you in any way?

Vivian is about to say something when Edward comes up behind

them.

EDWARD
All set. Let's go.

Mr. Thomas nods slightly to Edward.

MR. THOMAS
Mr. Harris.

EDWARD
Yes. We've got to run. Come on, Vivian.

Vivian seems reluctant to leave.

VIVIAN
Could... I get some cigarettes? I need one.

Edward looks a trifle annoyed.

EDWARD
We're in a rush.

VIVIAN
They're just over there.

She points to the gift shop.

EDWARD
(sighing)
Alright.

Vivian and Edward head toward the store. Vivian glances back at
Mr. Thomas who is still watching her, concerned.

VIVIAN
âBye. Thanks for everything.

INT. GIFT SHOP - DAY

Vivian stands in front of the counter. Edward browses a magazine

rack.
123

VIVIAN
Virginia Slim Lights.

The CLERK sets the cigarettes down on the counter. Edward tosses
him a couple of dollars.

Edward pulls a woman's magazine from the rack and shows the cover
to Vivian. On it is a stunningly beautiful young woman.

EDWARD
That's Cindy.

Vivian takes her cigarettes and stares at the cover.

VIVIAN
She's... beautiful.

EDWARD
She's very little. Just over five feet.
But she's got the best body. It's
perfect, and her face... you can see.

He tosses the magazine back onto the rack. As they exit, Vivian
glances back at the smiling face on the magazine.

EDWARD
Dumber than a doornail, though. I guess
they beat the intelligence out of you in
finishing school.

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE / DRIVEWAY - DAY

 

Edward and Vivian come out of the hotel to their waiting car.
The Bellboy has finished packing the bags in the trunk. Edward
tips him.

The Valets open the doors and Edward and Vivian get in. Edward
tips the Valets. They close the doors. The Mercedes drives off.

INT. MERCEDES - DAY

As Edward drives the car down Wilshire, Vivian is nervously
smoking a cigarette. The fur is in her lap and she is
unconsciously stroking it.

EDWARD
How long do you think it will take to get
from Beverly Hills to Hollywood?

VIVIAN
I don't know for sure. Ten minutes or
something.

Edward glances at his watch.
124

EDWARD
And an hour to get to the airport.
(shaking his head)
I don't know why I always cut these things
so close.

Edward slows the car down as they approach a parking spot in
front of the furrier. He pulls in and stops the car.

EDWARD
I'll just run in and get rid of this.

He reaches over and takes the fur from Vivian. Vivian abruptly
turns her head away. Edward notices.

EDWARD
What's the matter?

VIVIAN
Noth'n.

Edward stares at the back of her head for a moment, then decides
he doesn't have time to pursue it. He gets out of the car.

As she watches Edward take the fur into the store, a tear rolls
down Vivian's cheeks. She takes a drag from her cigarette. She
stashes it out in the car's ashtray.

Within seconds, Edward is back out of the store. He rounds the
car and jumps in.

EDWARD
Alright. That's done.

Edward throws the car into gear and drives off.

Now Vivian is crying harder. So much that she can't conceal her
sobs. Edward glances over at her, concerned and annoyed at the
same time.

EDWARD
Now what? What's the matter?

Vivian is crying hard. She can't talk.

EDWARD
Jesus. What is it? Can you tell me why
you're upset now? Damn it, I don't even
know how to get back to Hollywood.

VIVIAN
(choking it out)
Just go straight!
125
EDWARD

What happened to you? Is it the fur? You
didn't expect me to let you keep it, did

you?

It was rented.

VIVIAN
(still crying)

Just forget it!

Vivian tries to control herself. She wipes her eyes and manages

to stop the tears.

EDWARD

Is that it? The fur?

VIVIAN

Just stop it! Why do you always pick at

me?

I don't want to talk. You always

make me talk.

EDWARD

I just want to know what's going on. If
you're unhappy and there is something I

can do...

YES!

alone.

Vivian.

this.

VIVIAN

I LOVED THAT FUR! Now leave me

EDWARD
I didn't want it to end like
I mean, be reasonable. That's a

twenty thousand dollar fur.

VIVIAN

I didn't say I wanted it. I knew you were
going to take it back. Okay! I'm not

dumb!

I knew I couldn't have it. You

asked me why I was crying and I told you!

Edward is quiet for a moment. Vivian has managed to control her
crying. She stares coldly ahead.

VIVIAN

Make a left on Highland. Right there.

Edward turns the car and they head up Highland. Edward's face is

tense.

EDWARD

Look, if you really want a fur, I'll buy
you a fur. That one was just too
expensive. Would you like a fur?
126

VIVIAN
No. Just take me home.

EDWARD
I'll get you a fur. I'1l miss my plane,
but if it'll make you stop crying I'll buy
you something.

VIVIAN
(angrily)
I'm not crying anymore.

EDWARD
God damn it, Vivian. I'll buy you a fur.
A nice one. Just it can't be that one.
That one's too much. I'll get you the
silver mink you tried on first. I'll
throw away a few thousand. Okay? I don't
know what the fuck you plan to do with one
on Hollywood Boulevard but...

VIVIAN
LEAVE ME ALONE! I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
FROM YOU!

Edward slams on the brakes. The car stops hard. Vivian stares
at him defiantly.

VIVIAN
You want me to walk home!? I'11 walk
home! It's three miles but I'll walk!

EDWARD
I don't want you to walk! I want you to
stop yelling!

Vivian turns away from him and stares out her window. Edward
takes a deep breath and starts the car up again.

Vivian glares out the window. They are leaving the nice, well-
tended homes of Hancock Park and approaching the streets of
Hollywood.

They are both tensely silent as Edward drives on. Vivian begins
to cry softly.

Edward listens to her with annoyance, but resists the impulse to
say anything.

They approach Hollywood Boulevard and Edward makes a right.
127

As Vivian stares out the window of the Mercedes she sees the
grimy streets and the shabby people mixing with the occasional
tourists. As they continue down the street toward Vivian's
section of the Boulevard we will see less and less tourists and
more shabbier-looking people. The streets become more grim and
dirty.

Vivian is sobbing harder now, trying to control herself but
unable. Edward, getting madder as it grows louder, finally
bursts.

EDWARD
I don't know why you had to do this to me.
We had a wonderful time together and now
you have to ruin it. You're acting so
emotional. I'd swear to God you aren't
the same girl I picked up last week.

Vivian grits her teeth and tries not to say anything. Edward,
now that he's gotten it out of his system, adopts a slightly
gentler tone as he continues to lecture her.

EDWARD
You should have told me you liked the fur
so much. I could have gotten you
something yesterday. It's really a stupid
thing to cry about. You know I bent over
backwards to make things pleasant for you
and it's just a shame that you're going to
spoil it all by being unreasonable.

The streets they pass are now filled mostly with drug dealers, an
occasional prostitute, and various homeless tramps. Vivian
stares out the window at the destitution outside, her eyes fixed
and red. She is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

EDWARD
This is about the area. Do you want me to
leave you here, or do you have a place
nearby?

Vivian says nothing.

EDWARD
Vivian? Where do you want me to let you
off?

Vivian screams hysterically. She seems to have suddenly gone
crazy. She starts pounding the roof of the car with her fists.

Edward quickly pulls the car over to the curb and stops it.
Vivian is still screaming and pounding.
128

EDWARD
VIVIAN! VIVIAN, CUT IT OUT!

Edward grabs her by the wrists and tries to stop her from
pounding the ceiling. Instead she starts pounding him.

EDWARD
Get out! GET OUT OF THE CAR!

Vivian continues to pound him for a moment but then she breaks
down and starts to sob limply.

EDWARD
You're out of your mind. You're insane!

Vivian is crying.

EDWARD
I've had enough of this. Get out of the
car.
Vivian doesn't move.
EDWARD

Get out of the car!

When she still doesn't move Edward throws open his door and gets
out.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS

 

Edward strides around the car and throws open the trunk. He
yanks out Vivian's few boxes of clothes and sets them down on the
curb. He shuts the trunk.

He walks over to the passenger door and opens it.

EDWARD
(firmly)
Get out.

Vivian doesn't move. She is still crying.

EDWARD
Don't make me regret ever picking you up.
Now please, get out of the car. I have
to go.

Edward grabs her by the hand and starts to pull her from the car.
Vivian explodes again and starts hitting and kicking him.

Edward forcibly drags her from the car and then throws her to the
ground. He slams the door shut.
129

As Vivian hits the ground she begins to cry again, too weak to
fight anymore.

Edward looks down at her. He takes the money envelope from his
jacket and holds it out to her.

EDWARD
Here, take it. It's your money.

VIVIAN
(sobbing in fits)
I don't want it. Just go away.

EDWARD

Take it. I know you're not that stupid.
VIVIAN

No.
EDWARD

You'll regret it tomorrow if you don't
take it. You'll regret it the minute I
drive away.

Vivian doesn't say anything. Edward lays the envelope down on
the sidewalk in front of her.

He turns and walks around the car. Vivian lies frozen for a
moment and then suddenly snaps alive as she hears the sound of
his car door opening and closing.

She grabs the envelope and crushes it in her hand. She leaps at
the car and starts smashing her fists against it and the windows.

VIVIAN
Go to hell! I hate you! I hate your
money! TI hate it!

We see a flash of Edward's face as he stares at Vivian pounding
on his window. She's completely lost her mind. He puts the car
in gear and pushes on the accelerator.

Vivian is still pounding as the car pulls away. In a final
gesture of rage she throws the envelope on the car and it breaks
open as the cars peels off.

The money scatters across the gutter as the car drives away.
Vivian falls to her knees, weak and crying.

Across the street various shabby-looking people stare at Vivian
and the money.

Vivian is on her hands and knees sobbing. She can barely
breathe. She is completely broken.
130
She wipes the tears from her cheeks. She looks down the street.
The Mercedes is gone.

For a brief moment she is still, frozen like a statue.

She reaches down in the gutter and starts to pick up the money.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BUS - DAY

An old Greyhound bus drives down the freeway from Los Angeles.
It moves easily through the traffic. A small sign over the
windshield reads: DISNEYLAND.

INT. BUS - DAY

Vivian and Kit are sitting in the bus. Kit is sitting next to
the window, looking outside with a warm, happy smile. She is so
excited she can barely stand it.

KIT
Could I get one of those balloons? You
know, with the ears?

Vivian sits next to Kit staring off with utterly blank and empty
eyes. The side of her cheek is still bruised. She is wearing
her mint green dress, but her hair is poorly done and lies limply
around her pale face. Kit coughs.

KIT
Oh, I guess that's stupid. Those are for
kids.

Vivian blinks and glances over at Kit, tired.

VIVIAN
No, babe. You can have a balloon. One
with the ears.

Kit smiles happily and looks back out the window. Vivian stares
emptily ahead.

FADE OUT.
