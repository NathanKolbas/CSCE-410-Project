"DISH DOGS"

Ives Original Screenplay, pre-pre-

problems.

FADE IN:
INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

STAINLESS STEEL walls and counters. Dishes CLANGING. STEAM
and SMOKE rising. COOKS in a fury. WAITERS and WAITRESSES
yelling, frantically picking up their orders.

IN THE DISH AREA

The commotion continues as more WAITERS and WAITRESSES unload
an endless supply of dirty dishes.

But on the other side of the dish counter there is order;
MORGAN WRIGHT stands in the "pit," racking the dishes with
speed and precision, talking to the NEW GUY.

MORGAN
Dish washing is like life, once you
get behind you can never catch up.

Morgan sprays down a rack of dishes and launches it into the
HOBART (dishwasher). Morgan is 23 years old, tall, thin, and
wears the look of a Kennedy.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
(continuing)
You've got to spray the dishes
down. This thing'll sanatize'em
but it won't really wash'em. You
can't sacrifice quality for speed.

And as the Hobart spits out the clean dishes, JASON FLETCHER
unloads them. Jason's a solid six feet, mature looking for
JASON
(to the new guy)
Be careful, if you hang out with
him long enough you'll learn to
like him.

MORGAN
Quiet please.

Jason whisks a load of dishes away.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
There's just so many different
little things to this job.

Morgan grabs a dark green rack.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
(continuing)

Like these dark green racks are
much better for these boats then
the light green ones. The light
green ones are better for plates.
It's just practice. It's all
practice.

Morgan shoves the dark green rack of "boats" into the Hobart.

WAITRESS
Full wine glass.

And the WAITRESS flips the wine glass rack over to Morgan and
he shoves it into the Hobart.

KELLY
Is it busy tonight?

MORGAN
Not really. With three of us, we
should be able to toy with this.
A WAITER pokes his head out of the office, yells:

WAITER
Morgan, phone.

INT. RESTAURANT - OFFICE
Morgan sits at one of the desks talking into the phone.

MORGAN
You're still going through with it?

DAVID (V.O.)
Yeah. Can you believe that shit?

MORGAN
",.. and you shall change froma
man with a future to a man with a
past."

DAVID (V.O.)
No... now I'm a man with a
future... and a past!

MORGAN
We'll be there Friday morning.

INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - DISH AREA
Morgan enters. Jason's in the pit racking the dishes.

MORGAN
David's selling out.

JASON
That's a problem. They're really
going to do it?
Morgan nods.

JASON (CONT'D)

We going?

MORGAN
Yeah, to try and talk him out of
it.

Another clean rack of dishes exits the Hobart.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Where's the new guy?

JASON
I thought he was with you.

Jason yells across the kitchen to the MANAGER:

JASON (CONT'D)
Where's your boy?

Worried, the manager moves to the dish area.

MANAGER
What'd you mean?
MORGAN
Looks like you lost another dish
dog.
MANAGER
What'd you guys do to him?
JASON
(yells)

Has anyone seen the new guy?

WAITRESS
I saw him walk out the back door.

Jason pulls the new guy's abandoned apron out of the linen
bag and holds it up. Morgan and Jason laugh.

MANAGER
Shit! Fucking dish dog! Can you
guys stay for a few more days?
MORGAN
Sorry... we got an execution to go
to.
FADE TO BLACK

And the Dish Dog theme song starts to play. It's an upbeat,
fast paced song about freedom and being on the open road.

CLOSE ON NORTH CAROLINA LICENSE PLATE: "DSH DOGS"

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

The license plate is attached to BLACK BEAUTY, a 1958 Ford, F-
100, pick-up truck. Black Beauty wears a rough coat of black

paint and is missing all four hubcaps.

The truck races away from Armorillo Texas, past the "Leaving
Armorillo" sign.

INT. TRUCK

Jason drives, while Morgan sits in the passenger seat reading
a beat up old map.

JASON
You hungry?

MORGAN
Nope.

Morgan highlights Armorillo Texas. Dozens of cities in the
Southwest have already been highlighted.

JASON
You got to go to the bathroom?

MORGAN
No. We got to make it to Oklahoma
City if we're going to make it by
Friday.

Jason looks away.

MORGAN
What's the problem?
JASON
We're not out of gas... it's got to

be the fuel pump.
EXT. TRUCK

Jason gets out, immediately moving to the side of the road to
take a leak. Morgan opens the hood and stares at the engine.

Jason joins Morgan and goes to work. He pulls off a hose
from the engine and covers it with his thumb.

JASON
Try and crank it.

Morgan gets into the truck and turns the engine over.

JASON (CONT'D)
That's good. It's the fuel pump.

MORGAN
Can we fix it?

JASON
Dude... toy.

Jason goes to the back of the truck, opens up an extensive
tool kit and pulls out another fuel pump.

EXT. TRUCK - DAY

handful of snacks.

MORGAN
What'd you get?

JASON
Nothin'.

Jason gets back into the truck.

MORGAN
What'd you spend ten bucks on
snacks?

JASON

No, about Eight-fifty.

Morgan gets back into the passenger seat and the truck
lumbers away.

INT. TRUCK

The temperature gauge nears 240 degrees. Morgan and Jason

notice.
MORGAN
It's getting a little hot, isn't
it?
JASON

Don't worry a thing about it.
EXT. GREENSBORO - BATTLEGROUND ROAD - DAY
The truck maneuvers through the bumper to bumper traffic.
EXT. GREENSBORO - BATTLEGROUND ROAD
The truck turns off, into an upper-middle class neighborhood.
EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD
The truck rolls to a stop. Light steam rises out of the
engine and green anti-freeze boils onto the street and runs
into the gutter.
INT. TRUCK

Jason pats the dashboard, says:

JASON
This is a lot of truck for four-
fifty.

MORGAN
Touche’.

EXT. TRUCK

as Morgan and Jason get out of the truck and walk toward the
WRIGHT'S HOUSE; it's white bred, middle-class America.

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

The vacuum roars. MRS. NORMA WRIGHT pushes it back and forth
and as she turns she sees Morgan and Jason standing in the
doorway holding a few bags.

Mrs. Wright turns the vacuum off.

MORGAN
We came back for David's wedding.

MRS. WRIGHT
You should have called. Your
father will be so happy you're

MORGAN
We're going back on the road in a
few days.

Morgan walks past Mrs. Wright, up the stairs.
Jason follows, says:

JASON
It's good to see you again Mrs.
Wright.

Mrs. Wright nods and watches as they climb the stairs.

MORGAN (0.S.)
We'll be back later. We're going
to see the professor.

EXT. PROFESSOR FROST'S HOUSE - DAY

The truck rests on the street in front of PROFESSOR FROST's
house. Frost's house stands out from the other middle- class
homes, it's more... artsy. There's a few pieces of "modern
art" littering the front lawn.

MORGAN (0.S.)
Dishwashing is to me a soapy
salvation, rejuvenation for my
soul, recuperation from my
upbringing, rejection of the
bourgeoisie, reclamation of my
will, and refuge from a
teleological hurricane.

INT. PROFESSOR FROST'S HOUSE - PATIO - DAY
Morgan sits in a wicker chair.

MORGAN
(continuing)
With each dish I wash it's one less
tie I have to wear. With each pot
I scrub it's one less mortgage
payment I have to make--

PROFESSOR FROST sits across from Morgan, smoking a pipe and
drinking orange juice from a glass bottle. He's nearing 65,
bearded, and wears sandals and shorts.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
(continuing)

--with each glass I rack it's one
less trip to Disneyland I have to
take with my ingrate children, and
each time I crank up Black Beauty,
it's one less car payment I have to
make.

Professor Frost claps and laughs.

FROST
How much longer do you think you
can keep doing it?

JASON
I think we could stay out there at
least another couple of years.

MORGAN
About 37 states. Maybe will hit
Europe after that. We've covered
almost the entire south, all the
way out to the west coast.

Morgan pulls the map out of his backpack, carefully unfolds
it and lays it out on the coffee table in front of Frost.

FROST
I've got to tell you, when you
packed out of here a year ago in
that truck, I didn't think you'd
make it past Georgia. It sounds
like you're really doing what you
want.

Morgan and Jason smile, gloat.

INT. ACURA - DUSK

DAVID ALEXANDER drives, blond hair, blue eyes, conservative.
SHANE MARTIN, dark, nearing six foot and 220 pounds sits in

the passenger seat.

SHANE
So fellas, what's up?

Jason and Morgan are in the backseat.

JASON
Dish doggin' it.

SHANE

MORGAN

It's wet.
SHANE

Yeah... So fellas, what's the word?
MORGAN

Marriage.
SHANE

Our boy's getting married.

DAVID
Isn't that crazy? It's not scaring
me as much as it should.

JASON
Was it just a nightmare getting
everything together?

David looks into the rear view mirror to check his hair; it's
short, slicked back, all in place.

DAVID
Not for me. All the decisions were
pretty much made by Karen and my
mom.

JASON
Is your family pretty excited?

DAVID
Weddings are one big excuse for
people to get pissed off at each
other. My mom and my dad's mom
have done nothing but yell at each
other for a month.

MORGAN
What were they fighting about?

DAVID
My Grandmother is like, " Why
wasn't Uncle Richard invited?" And
we're just like, "because we
haven't seen him in fifteen years."
And then Nanny, my mom's mom, wants
to invite three of her friends, who
we don't even know.

And she went to Karen's mom, who's
to nice to say "no," so then my
other Grandmother wants to invite
some of her friends.

General laughter.

MORGAN
How's the job?

DAVID
I still like it.

MORGAN
I'm not surprised.

DAVID
(ignoring him)
I just finished my first audit.

MORGAN
Was it as bad Granger said it would
be?

DAVID

No, it wasn't that bad. It wasn't
an unqualified report.

JASON
(to Shane)
How's your job?

SHANE
I fucking hate it.

MORGAN
What'd you do?

SHANE
Fucking fraud administrator...
Yeah, I know it sounds great but
all I do is wait by my computer for
someone to call me up and bitch me
out. "I got a fucking sixty-
thousand dollar phone bill. What
the fuck are you going to do about
it?"

MORGAN
Sixty-thousand dollars?

SHANE
Sometimes more. People'd steal
those chips and duplicate them.
There'd be calls to places like
India.

MORGAN
Any chicks?

SHANE
Yeah, I struck out with this older
lady.

MORGAN
How much older?

SHANE
Fucking forty-two.

MORGAN
Shane! What happened?

SHANE
You know, we went out, seemed to
have a good time, and she avoided
me from then on.

JASON
Dude, you should come with us on
the road.

MORGAN

Yeah, we'll strap another chair in
the back of the truck.

SHANE
I might just do that.

DAVID
Have you guys seen the Professor?

MORGAN
Yeah, we were just there.

SHANE
So what's up with him? He just
doesn't seem like a happy guy to
me.

MORGAN
What are you talking about?

SHANE
I mean does he seem like a happy
person to you?

MORGAN
I don't think he cares about being
happy. There's something much more
important than that. He's content.
Content to know that he's lived his
life the way he wanted. He didn't
let women or society trap him.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
(continuing)

He's about the only person I know
that's lived their life with any
semblance of free will. If that
doesn't lead to happiness, it leads
to a helluva lot more.

Jason points at the street sign, says to David:

JASON
Take a left up here.

David gets in the left lane.
JASON (CONT'D)
(continuing)
Let's do a drive through.
SHANE
You guys been back since

graduation?

MORGAN/ JASON
No.

EXT. GUILFORD COLLEGE ROAD - NIGHT

The Acura turns onto Guilford College Road.

EXT. GUILFORD COLLEGE

"Oldest Co-ed college in the country, founded by The Society
of Friends in 1848," reads the sign at the entrance to

SHANE
The Eastern Music Festival just
ended.
JASON

Just think, the people that were
Sophomores when we graduated are
going to be the seniors.

Morgan considers this.

MORGAN
I don't want to talk about it.

David stops the car in front of ENGLISH HALL. They stare at
the building for a moment, remembering. It's a nondescript
brick dormitory.

JASON
We really thought we were the shit.

MORGAN
How many times did we walk down
those steps?

JASON
A bunch.

DAVID
Let's go see some tittys before we
all get depressed.
EXT. GUILFORD COLLEGE
David revs the engine and they're gone.

INT. BABY DOLLS - NIGHT

The fanciest strip club in Greensboro; red carpet, brass
railings, and monied rednecks.

And the girls: beautiful and plentiful; giving lap dances,
standing at the bar counting their tips, dancing on one of
the three stages, serving drinks.

It's dark and the music blares and Jason and David sit by the
main stage ogling LINDA LIPPS.

The songs ends and the announcer comes over the P.A.:

ANNOUNCER
Let's have a big hand for Linda!
Remember gentlemen, these lovely
ladies only work for your tips, so
bring out those wallets and show
them your appreciation... And now,
you've seen her in Penthouse,
you've seen her on your T.V., let's
have a big hand for... Sindee Coxx.

The lights go down and the music goes up, and then the
spotlight finds...

SINDEE COXX, as she runs through the smoke in a cowboy
costume, and jumps onto the stage. BANG! BANG! as Sindee
let's off a couple of rounds from her six-shooter.

The music blares.

The monied rednecks start hootin' and hollerin'.

Shane and Morgan sit at a small table by themselves.

A WAITRESS approaches them.

WAITRESS
You guys need anything?

Morgan shakes his head, looks around, takes it all in.

SHANE
I'm good.

AT THE STAGE

Jason and David watch as Sindee takes off her chaps to reveal
only a G-string. David guzzles a beer as he stuffs a dollar
bill between Sindee's naked breasts.

AT THE TABLE

Morgan stares across the room.

MORGAN
Check that out.

Shane looks, it's a BEAUTIFUL STRIPPER giving a lap dance to
a heavy middle-aged REDNECK. He attempts to fondle her and
she playfully pushes his hands away.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
I wonder how much that cost?

SHANE
You should ask her.

David and Jason join Morgan and Shane.

DAVID
That's a lot of titty for a dollar.

JASON
Maybe we should call the girls and
see if they want to join us.

A WAITRESS stops at the table carrying a tray of shots in
test tubes topped with cherries.

WAITRESS
You want a body shot?

JASON
Get whatever you want, this one's
on us.

David wraps his arms around her waist and pulls her close and
whispers in her ear. She laughs and whispers something back.
The music blares.

The waitress puts the test tube between her breasts and
brings David's face to her chest and leans forward so he can
swallow the drink. David smiles and pulls her closer. She
takes the cherry stem in her mouth and slowly feeds him the
cherry. David eats the cherry and smiles in triumph.

JASON (CONT'D)
Karen would be pretty pleased.

DAVID
I'm not married yet!

WAITRESS
You want one?

Jason nods and turns and the waitress straddles him. She
puts the test tube between her breast and brings Jason's face
to her chest and leans forward so he can swallow the drink.
She takes the cherry stem in her mouth and slowly feeds him
the cherry.

Jason pulls $10 out of his back pocket and gives it to the
waitress.

WAITRESS (CONT’D)
Anyone else?

No thanks.

Morgan shakes his head. The waitress leaves.
DAVID
Morgan, I'm surprised you weren't
all over the body shot.
MORGAN
You should have asked her if she
dances.
David chugs down another beer. Morgan looks back to the lap
dance only she's gone. The redneck reclines by himself,
enjoying the show.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
You guys about ready to go?

DAVID
We just got here.

David gets up and starts walking toward the bar, only there's
a stage in front of him. He jumps onto the stage and walks
across, past a girl dancing, and jumps down on the other
side, which is at the bar.

Morgan and Jason share a look.

JASON
What is that guy thinking?

MORGAN
Don't even worry about it, we're
out of here.
Morgan exits.
AT THE BAR

A bouncer stares down at David.

BOUNCER
You need to calm the fuck down.

EXT. BABY DOLLS - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

As Morgan exits Baby Dolls, he passes the beautiful stripper
that he watched give a lap dance. Her name is ANNE. Their
eyes meet.

As Morgan's almost past her she says:

You got a cigarette?

Morgan stops, turns around.

MORGAN
No... I don't smoke.

ANNE
Oh... okay.

MORGAN

I'm thinking about starting though.

ANNE
Oh yeah, why is that?

MORGAN
You know, you get to use a lot more
of your sick days. You die
earlier. And then I'd have a
cigarette when beautiful girls
asked me for one.

Anne smiles and turns away from Morgan. Morgan walks to the
Acura and gets in.

A moment later Anne jumps in after him.

ANNE
It's cold out there.
MORGAN
It's a hundred degrees.
ANNE
It's cold in here.
MORGAN
It's a hundred degrees in here,
too.
ANNE

Okay, you win, game over. My
name's Anne.

She holds out her hand. Morgan shakes it.

MORGAN
I left it unlocked so I had some
place to go when I wanted to leave
early.

ANNE
You're funny.

MORGAN
Anyways...

ANNE
Stop saying that, it's making me
feel like you don't want to talk to

me.
MORGAN
I say it when I don't have anything
to say.
ANNE

Tell me how much you love me...
don't answer that.

MORGAN
Anyways...

ANNE
Stop saying that!

MORGAN
Okay... Do you like being a
stripper?

ANNE
Not really. It's like waiting
tables, everyone likes to talk
about how much money they make, but
it's like four hundred on a good
week, two hundred on a bad week.
I'm not going to get rich or
nothing.

MORGAN
Why do you do it?

ANNE
This is such an easy job, I mean
how hard is it to get up on stage
and shake your breasts around?

MORGAN
I'm not really sure.

ANNE
I only have to work about six hours
a night. I need something with
flexibility. And it doesn't bother
me to show my breasts to some horny
old man.

Anne pulls up her shirt to expose her breasts.
go straight for them- and they are lovely.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Breasts are like a magnet to a
man's eyes. I mean what's the big
deal?

She pulls her shirt back down.

MORGAN
I don't understand it myself, but
there's just no... "been there done

that," when it comes to breasts.

ANNE
So what do you do?

MORGAN
I'm a dishwasher.

ANNE
Do you like it?

It's kind of a lifestyle choice.

ANNE
You have a girlfriend?

MORGAN
Don't you think a better question
is whether or not someone considers
me their boyfriend?

ANNE
Why?

MORGAN

Well, I mean, that answers your
question a lot better. There could
be a girl out there who I consider
my girlfriend, but she doesn't
think I'm her boyfriend, or there
could be a girl out there that
thinks I'm her boyfriend, but I
don't really think of her as my
girlfriend. It's a perception

thing.
ANNE
(bewildered)
Okay... Does someone consider you

their boyfriend?

MORGAN
Well... no.

ANNE
You like girls?

MORGAN
No- I mean Yes, I do. I resent it,
but I do.

ANNE
I had to ask, I mean you're sitting
out here by yourself when you could
be in there looking at naked women.

ANNE
I don't know... We never talk like
this.

MORGAN

What'd you mean?
Anne thinks for a moment.

ANNE
Like... he might ask me if I liked
being a stripper but- but it would
just end with my saying "yes."
MORGAN
Why'd you go out with him in the
first place?
ANNE
I was attracted to him. You want
to give me a ride home?

MORGAN
How much?

ANNE
How... much?

And it dawns on Anne what Morgan is implying.

Fuck you. I'm not a whore. I just

Morgan's the best man.

Molly pulls closer to Jason. The music continues. Molly's
tall, preppy, "cute."

JASON (CONT'D)
What have you been up to?

MOLLY
I'm waiting tables at the Museum
Restaraunt, the money's great but
I'm looking for more of a career.

JASON
That sounds good, as long as you're
happy.

MOLLY
Other than that, I exercise a lot,

JASON
Do you have anything in mind for a
career?

MOLLY

I'm applying for this job as the
coordinator for a German study
abroad program. I think I'll get
it.

JASON
That sounds pretty good.

Morgan, Shane, and Professor Frost sit at a table watching
the couples dance.

Jason and Molly continue to dance. Jason finally says:

JASON (CONT'D)
Is there... any new men in your
life.

MOLLY
I've been going out with Aaron,
he's nice but it's nothing serious,
I could never marry him.

JASON
Why not?

MOLLY
He's just not as motivated as I am.
He doesn't have much concern for
getting ahead in life.

JASON
That's alright. Maybe he's just a
late bloomer?

MOLLY
I don't think so. What about you,
any new women in your life?

JASON
It's a little tough to go out with
anyone when you only stay in one
place for a week or two.

MOLLY
So when are you going to settle
down and get a real job?

JASON
Who knows? Someday I guess.

MOLLY
Did you give up on the big house,
the Mercedes, and the millions you
were going to have by the time you
were thirty?

JASON
I don't know, I'm just taking it
day by day.

MOLLY

You've got so much potential, it
seems like such a waste.

JASON
I don't know about that. I sort of
enjoy seeing the country and being
free.

MOLLY
Don't you want someone to come home
to and spend the rest of your life
with?

JASON
I've got Morgan.

MOLLY
You can't marry Morgan.

JASON
Settling down means giving up my
freedom. I'm not sure I'm ready to
do that.

"Baby Oh Baby" slowly fades out and the dancing stops and
people clap for Freddy and the Fantastics.

MOLLY
Now is that you talking, or Morgan?

CLINK! CLINK! CLINK! Morgan stands on stage tapping his

David's got it all. A promising
career, a really cool car, anda
beautiful wife. I hope I can one
day be as happy. And with that, I
purpose a toast to David and his

JASON
Nothin'.

Jason takes the empty dish rack and throws it down. He
starts to unload a clean rack but they're dirty.

JASON (CONT'D)
This sucks. Check the soap.

Jason slams another rack of washed dishes back through the

Good... And remember, you guys said

you'd never walk out.

I'm not going to do it because
society tells me to. I'm not going

Morgan smiles.
ANNE (CONT'D)

(continuing)
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

MORGAN
Working. I'm training a new guy,
Juan.

ANNE

What time do you get off?

MORGAN
Probably about one.

ANNE
Come pick me up. We'll go watch a
movie or something.

MORGAN
That's a little past my bedtime.
ANNE
Oh come on, I'll give you a free
lap dance.
(and)

Why do you say "no" when you want
to say "yes?"

MORGAN
I don't know, I think it has
something to do with... something

to do with my childhood. You know,
I was raised in this really
conventional family. I mean, I had
my mom, and my dad and a brother.
And my dad had a job and... I just
really don't know.

EXT. RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - DAY
Morgan and Anne walk toward the truck.
ANNE

An entire conversation without

INT. OUTBACK STEAK HOUSE - DISH AREA - NIGHT

JUAN, "the new guy," is in the pit racking dishes. He's
hispanic-american.

WAITRESS
Full wine rack.

Juan doesn't seem to notice the waitress.

WAITRESS (CONT’D)
Full wine rack.

And Morgan's returning for a load of dishes. He grabs the
wine rack and swings it into the dishwasher.

MORGAN

When ever these get full just

run'em through and put a new rack

up.

Juan smiles and nods, and goes back to racking dishes.

MORGAN (CONT'D)

Hey, we got to replace the soap

every so often.

Juan smiles and nods. Morgan turns the Hobart off and
unplugs the soap bin and starts to roll it out the back door.

INT. OUTBACK STEAK HOUSE - DISH AREA - LATER
Morgan and Juan wash the dishes.

Jason enters the dish area. He's wearing a tie, freshly
shaven, and looks like he just got a hair cut.

JASON
How's it going?

MORGAN
Great. Hey Juan, I fuck your
mother every way to Sunday.
Juan smiles and nods.
Jason laughs and walks away.

INT. OUTBACK STEAK HOUSE - DISH AREA - LATER

It's closing time. Morgan and Juan put the finishing touches
on the dish room.

Morgan exits the house, walking quickly, almost running. He
gets into the truck and tears off.

EXT. BABY DOLLS - BACK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Anne and SUSAN take a break, smoke, argue with the REDNECK
that Anne was lap dancing for earlier. His name is DEWIT.
He's big, a full 250 pounds, always wears a cowboy hat and a
string tie that matches his polyester shirt.

ANNE
Fuck you. I'm not a whore. I'll
get you the money.

DEWIT
You'll get me my money or you'll
fuck my brains out, baby.

SUSAN
Leave her alone.

DEWIT
Maybe you have my $800 dollars?

DEWIT (CONT'D)

You owe me.

And behind them, at the corner of the building stands Morgan,
watching. He walks forward. Dewit turns and sees Morgan.

MORGAN
You ready to go?

ANNE
Yeah.

Dewit turns and starts walking away.
DEWIT
I'll see you later.
(as he passes Morgan)
Your girlfriend's a real looker.
She must be great in bed.
INT. TRUCK - STREET - NIGHT
Morgan drives. They wait at a stop light.
ANNE
Just go through it. No one's

coming.

Morgan looks both ways. The streets are empty at this late
hour.

MORGAN
No. I'll wait.

Silence, until finally Morgan can't stand it anymore, he has
to ask:

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Who was that guy?

ANNE
Just some asshole. You get'em in
the business.

MORGAN
You owe him money?

What movie are we going to see?

INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark, illuminated only by the television, which
sits on the floor. The room is nearly empty. A few boxes
with Anne's belongings and a futon, which Morgan and Anne
lounge on.

"SAY ANYTHING," plays on the television. John Cusack and
Lilli Taylor are making love in a car.

MORGAN
Why exactly did you choose this
movie?

And Anne looks up at Morgan and moves close to him and he
looks at her and tries to hold back and they kiss. The first
kiss is quick. The second kiss is longer, deeper. And the
third kiss is even longer and deeper.

Anne flips the television off, creating complete darkness.
The kissing continues and their hands start to roam around
each other's bodies.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Listen, we can keep going, and we
can do anything you want but- but
that's not going to make you my
girlfriend. It's not going to mean
anything.

Anne pulls away.

ANNE
Why?

MORGAN
I already told you. I don't have
girlfriends.

I'm a low maintenance girlfriend. A
rose once in a while.

never had a girlfriend? Didn't you
ever ask yourself, "what gives?"

ANNE
Toot your own horn, why don't you?

Anne moves away, reaches for a cigarette, lights one.

MORGAN
I'm going back on the road. I'm
not going to settle for a 100K and
a white picket fence and a couple
of kids and a wife. There's got to
be more.

ANNE
You got to be rich to talk like
that. It's a good thing they
didn't have dishwashing as a major
in college, or you wouldn't have
anything to do right now.

MORGAN
I'd have found something, been a
terrorists or joined a gang.

Anne sits, smokes.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
When did you know you liked me?

Anne puffs on her cigarette, trying to decide whether she
should answer the question or not.

ANNE
When you showed up to help me move.
Guys that say shit they don't mean,
pisses me off.

MORGAN
Yeah, I do what I say. It's my
greatest asset and greatest
liability.

ANNE
What do you mean?

I'd like to lie to you. I'd like
to have sex with you.

home?

ANNE
Yeah. Why are we talking about

Sorry. When I get nervous I go

Shane and David eat breakfast.

SHANE

JASON
It's actually going pretty well.

DAVID
You going to follow my lead soon?

JASON
I don't know about all that. I am
thinking about getting a new car
though.

MORGAN
You think they'll let you get one

No, but after I kick your ass and

Alright.
JASON

MORGAN
You're a freakin' horse trader.

You're a cocksucker... Seriously,

INT. VICTORIA SECRETS

Morgan and Anne enter: panties, bras, and lace garters.
Morgan's the only male in the store. He notices.

ANNE
Come on.

Anne grabs Morgan's hand and pulls him over to the bra

ANNE (CONT'D)
Which ones do you like?

Anne sorts through a few bras. Morgan looks at a MIDDLE-

It's the busiest time of the busiest night...

WAITERS and WAITRESSES flock to the dish area, pouring dirty
dishes onto the dish counter but...

Morgan's there, filling the racks as fast as the wait staff

Hobart and...

Jason's on top of it, keeping up with the heavy flow of clean

No, it's not. It's not going to be

You're twenty-one years old, I'm

Shaw. How can you be so sure? Why
are woman so damn sure? On the one
side I think I love you and I'd
like to just buy a house and live
with you, but then, over here, it's

get old and die, and- and we'll

university would accept me. I

love. We made beautiful love on
the beach, but- but I was young and
I let her go. I thought I was
going to find more.

MORGAN
What happened to her?
FROST
She got married... If you've met

someone you really love, and she

ever get another chance.
