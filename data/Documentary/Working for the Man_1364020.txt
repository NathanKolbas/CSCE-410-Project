               CLOSE: An old SNAPSHOT

               CREDITS AND MUSIC ROLL OVER:

               -- A father, closing in on 40 and a son, 11, on a skating 
               rink, wearing hockey uniforms, holding hockey sticks like 
               swords in battle, frozen laughter on their faces.

               Vague CHIRPING of birds in deep background.

                                     DON'S 37 Y.O. VOICE OVER
                         Listen... my Dad isn't really sick, 
                         and he's not really sad, if you think 
                         that you won't understand our story, 
                         or you'll cry instead of laugh.

               PULLING BACK FROM SNAPSHOT TO REVEAL a wall full of snapshots 
               and family memories, Mom, Dad, Cicely, and Don, pets, cars, 
               house, time marching on... Dad and Mom getting old, kids 
               grown, college, girl friends, the time, place and meaning of 
               each itching to be discovered, as DON'S

               VOICE OVER CONTINUES:

                                     DON'S VOICE OVER
                         I call him My Dad instead of his 
                         name because he's probably like your 
                         Dad too. And that's why I want to 
                         share our story... cause you have a 
                         Dad too, and so you and I share the 
                         same feelings.

               PULLING BACK FARTHER TO REVEAL DAD, sitting at the kitchen 
               table in front of the gallery of snapshots, ageless, healthy, 
               strong, yet a gleamy stare in his eyes tells another story; 
               as he is lifting a spoonful of soup to his lips as a two 
               year old might, fascinated with the chanciness of whether it 
               will make it all the way to his lips. A lovable old dog, 
               MAX, sits by his side with big brown eyes also transfixed on 
               the wayward spoon's long journey.

                                     DON'S VOICE OVER
                         When my Dad lost some of his marbles 
                         to become an Alzheimer's case, at 
                         first I thought, how sad, he's gone, 
                         gone, gone. He was just entering a 
                         new and very exciting phase of his 
                         life. The rest of us would just have 
                         to learn how to keep up.

               CREDITS END

               DAD is attracted by the sound of the birds, he looks in that 
               direction, lets his spoon just plop into the soup; he grins 
               at the sloppy results, gets up and walks to the screened 
               window, REVEALING MOM, in her chair, working a crossword 
               puzzle, cigarette drifting smoke from the ashtray, looking 
               up as he goes by her, ingrained resignation in her eyes --

                                     MOM
                              (in her smoker's 
                              foghorn voice)
                         Will you... finish the soup. You 
                         look so damn thin.

                                     DAD
                         Fly away.

               ON DAD, moving to watch the bird feeding station outside the 
               window -- just one bird pecking at slim pickings. Dad reaches 
               into a bag punches the screen window open, and throws a 
               handful of seed in the direction of the feeding station. 
               Luckily much of the seed hits its mark, and about six birds 
               suddenly fly in for a feeding frenzy.

               A glint appears in Dad's eyes. MAX rises up to the window's 
               ledge, gives the birds an obligatory woof and growl. Dad 
               leans in to BARK with Max. Max looks at Dad in surprise, 
               then the two of them join in a barking frenzy. Brothers under 
               the skin.

                                     MOM'S VOICE
                         Okay, Okay... now the birds're eating, 
                         so you come in and finish your soup. 
                         Come on.

               She gets up, joins him, and tries to lead him back to the 
               table. MAX follows.

               Dad turns to her... and BARKS right in her face. So does 
               Max.

                                     MOM
                         I made this soup... and it's damn 
                         good.

                                     DON'S VOICE OVER
                         Mom never really talked WITH Dad. 
                         She always talked AT him... their 
                         whole life... we all did that in our 
                         family. Communication was not our 
                         strong suit. So, when Dad lost his 
                         ability to make sense, it really 
                         didn't make much difference.

                                     DAD
                         ...you... took my money...

               As she leads him to sit at the table by the elbow, Dad winces 
               like a dog in pain.

                                     MOM
                         Your money is in the bank.

                                     DAD
                         ...nobody gloms the man do you see 
                         the man pepper her if not today maybe 
                         a way... get the ticket...

                                     MOM
                         That's right. The soup is good. Come, 
                         eat the soup... eat the soup.

               Finally at the table, Dad barks, thrashes his arms up, 
               throwing her back. Angry, he thrashes at the bowl of soup 
               and it tips over. Mom catches herself at the kitchen sink, 
               grabs a towel and moves to the table to wipe up the soup.

               Max starts lapping up the soup on the floor.

                                     DON'S VOICE OVER
                         Now that I know what I know, I know 
                         that we did have a strong suit. Our 
                         strong suit was... love. L.O.V.E. 
                         Deep, abiding, unspoken and buried 
                         under a dozen layers of pure 
                         dysfunctional shit. It didn't really 
                         matter, we were just like everybody 
                         else.

               Dad starts to scuffle with Mom. He doesn't want her to clean 
               up the soup. Ad-libbing scuffle, as OUR VIEW MOVES through 
               the gallery wall.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         That's me, when I was ten. That's my 
                         older sister, Cicely, she and I used 
                         to write songs together, we even had 
                         one on the charts... "Jumpin' Through 
                         Hoops for You,"... but that was years 
                         ago before she got married to this 
                         rich guy and I became a Certified 
                         Financial Planner... helping other 
                         people to plan their insurance, and 
                         retirements and how to save their 
                         money. -- and that was my dog, Charlie -- 
                         I tried to take him to college, but... 
                         oh, well... and, oops, there's my 
                         wife... oops my ex-wife, Susie... 
                         and my little boy, Richie. He was 
                         six then, and now he's thirteen, and 
                         he hates me.

               DAD AND MOM, scuffling back and forth in front of the Gallery 
               of snapshots. Dad is now trying to put on his hat and a scarf.

                                     MOM
                         Where are you going!?

                                     DAD
                         ...the man... back to the man he 
                         knows. He knows.

               Dad walks through a door, but it's the broom closet. Brooms 
               and buckets fly out hitting him on the head, he steps on a 
               bottle of dish soap, spurting its contents all over him, and 
               Mom too as she tries to stop him.

                                     MOM
                         Where are you going! Stop... right 
                         now.

               Dad throws some bird seed in her face and runs out the door, 
               Max following him. Mom is stunned, fighting to get the bird 
               seed out of her eyes, mouth and hair.

                                     MOM
                         Damn it, you!... wait!

               THE PHONE RINGS. She answers it.

                                     MUFFLED PHONE VOICE
                         Mrs. Markopolis? I'm Rex Borden. Our 
                         records here in Toronto show that 
                         you own 200 Kruggerands and...

               She hangs up and runs out the door.

               EXT. OLD TOWN - MIDWESTERN SUBURBAN STREET - ICY - WINTRY - 
               DUSK

               Dad has moved quickly from the house, through the gate, where 
               Mom is just emerging, looking this way, then that way, when 
               she spots him and calls after him.

               Dad pays no attention as he heads one way, looks around with 
               a puzzled and then a resolved look on his face, scurries in 
               the next direction, and across the street, Max at his side, 
               with Mom yelling after him to stop.

               He and Max get to the other side of the street, when --

               WE HEAR, BUT HE DOESN'T -- SCREECHING BRAKES.

               The BIG CITY BUS glides on the icy street, trying to stop, 
               the driver's face looming large through the window, as he 
               frantically turns the steering wheel... too late.

               ON MOM --

               KA-BASH! -- as she's smashed and thrown aside by the bus 
               like a rag doll.

               ON DAD

               -- as he (and Max) determinedly pushes his way along the 
               street, unaware of what has happened in his wake.

                                     DAD
                              (mumbling)
                         ...waiting... too late... today, NOT 
                         tomorrow. No wait. The man won't 
                         wait. No wait.

               As he goes, the SCENE BEHIND HIM recedes into the background, 
               the ruckus. The bus, the crowd, Mom's lifeless body sprawled 
               on the ground.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Let me tell you about my own life. 
                         It was a piece of crap, and getting 
                         worse.

               SIRENS SEGUEING TO:

               INT. AN OFFICE - DAY

               The BUSY EXECUTIVE sits behind her desk, trying to listen 
               carefully.

               DON, early 40's, dressed in his best suit, has his laptop 
               computer set up on her desk, and he pushes buttons from one 
               read-out to the next, a graphic journey through life's 
               actuarial statistics.

                                     DON
                         ...at age sixty, you'll have what 
                         you need to retire...

                                     EXEC
                         Yes, but not what I WANT to retire.

                                     DON
                         Okay, good point. So, how much is 
                         that? Supposing you want half a 
                         million in securities, plus an income 
                         of $65,000 a year, you'll have to 
                         add to your IRA...

                                     EXEC
                         Hah!

                                     DON
                         Hah?

                                     EXEC
                         Um-hmmm-hah!!? I'll need ten million 
                         in the bank, and one million a year.

                                     DON
                         That much? No one needs a million a 
                         year. You have to be realistic.

                                     EXEC
                         How the hell do YOU know that I am 
                         not being realistic. I'm a fucking 
                         money machine. There's a pot of gold 
                         on the other side of Mount Hood just 
                         waiting for me! I, Mr. SalesMan have, 
                         vision.

               She flexes her bicep and her bosom simultaneously. Don nods, 
               getting the point.

               The intercom buzzes. She picks it up.

                                     EXEC
                         It's your office... for you.

               Don gets up to take the phone, knocks his laptop into a vase, 
               tries to catch it, but too late... the vase crashes into a 
               dozen pieces on the hard floor.

               He grimaces, she rolls her eyes.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         See what I mean? I was dead meat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A 747 AIRPLANE - NIGHT

               On Don, squeezed in the middle seat, sleeping.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I hadn't been home in five years. 
                         Duluth, Minnesota... the kind of 
                         town people are from but never go 
                         to. When I called, -- once a week, 
                         every Sunday, when I had Richie with 
                         me... those Sundays when I had paid 
                         Susie her monthly pound of flesh... 
                         the ransom... for letting me see my 
                         own son... I'd talk to my Mom, but 
                         she'd say Dad was in the basement 
                         working on his wooden toys. He sold 
                         his hardware store and retired just 
                         so he could do that, it turned out 
                         to be a pretty good business, little 
                         toy stores all over the country bought 
                         his old fashioned wooden toys -- 
                         then at Christmas, he'd send one to 
                         Richie and one to my sister's kids... 
                         and he'd always keep a few to give 
                         'em away whenever he met a kid. 
                         Anyway, when Mom said he was busy in 
                         the basement, I always figured that 
                         he just didn't want to talk to me... 
                         sure he taught me to play hockey, 
                         but he also beat the crap out of me 
                         when I was thirteen, and to this 
                         day, I never knew why... what had I 
                         done? So it just seemed better if he 
                         pretended to be working on his toys 
                         when I called. I think we spend our 
                         whole lives trying to please our 
                         fathers, but I was beginning to 
                         believe... you can't. And now, I 
                         guess it was too late. Oh, well, oh, 
                         shit, now Mom's dead, Dad's got... 
                         what did they call it, Old Timer's 
                         disease... Oh, well, oh, shit, life 
                         is a bitch, and then you die. Ho. 
                         Ho. Ho. Merry Christmas.

               Don turns over in his sleep as best he can in the cramped 
               economy class seat in the middle. As he turns over, he pulls 
               on the seat in front of him with one hand, and elbows some 
               extra room from the heavyset lady next to him. Eyes burn at 
               him from two directions but Don doesn't notice it.

               ON HIS LAPTOP COMPUTER SCREEN: Actuarial tables and 
               statistics.

               ON DON - CLOSE

               His eyes pop open, staring, sad.

               ON DAD - CLOSE

               Mumbling to himself, sweating...

                                     DON'S VOICE
                         Dad? Is that you? Dad?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               (SCENE REVEALED)

               EXT. DAD'S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN BEHIND THE WHITE FENCE - 
               MORNING

               Dad's knees dug into the snow, as he searches through the 
               snow, pulling out dormant tulip bulbs as he finds them. Max 
               thinks it's a game, barks, grabs for the tulips, doesn't 
               like 'em, barks again. A "companion", a fat black woman, 
               stands in the doorway of the house.

               Don is well behind Dad, suitcase in hand, speaking to him... 
               but not heard.

                                     DAD
                              (to himself)
                         Hurry... hurry... nothing there. 
                         Nothing there.

               Finally, Don drops to his knees next to Dad.

                                     DON
                         Dad... it's me.

               Dad turns, looks at him, blinks, hands Don some tulips, and 
               keeps digging through the snow.

               Don is bewildered, puzzled, sad, helpless.

                                     DAD
                         No time. No time.

               Dad, Max, Don. In the snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY

               Don is on the phone. The Black Woman is bundled up waiting 
               by the phone. Dad is sitting in his usual chair, staring 
               ahead, planning his next devilish move.

                                     DON
                         But I can't be in two places at once, 
                         Mel. No. No. Of course I want my 
                         son... to live with me... he's been 
                         with his... can't you get a 
                         continuance or whatever... it's today, 
                         the funeral's today...

               INTERCUT --

               INT. MEL CHASE'S OFFICE - PORTLAND, OR. - DAY

               Mel Chase, an overworked patrician, stands behind his desk 
               in Portland, Ore., signing documents for his secretary while 
               Don's disembodied voice crackles on a speakerphone.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         ...my mother's funeral, Mel.

                                     MEL
                         I understand, Don... so then just 
                         drag yourself on a plane... and get 
                         back to Portland... if you want your 
                         kid to live with you.

               INTERCUTTING -- IN THE KITCHEN, Dad has that gleam in his 
               eye. The black teenager moves to Don, looks at her watch.

                                     DON
                         But, I've got my Dad now... can't 
                         the judge... just...?

                                     MEL'S VOICE
                         The judge can excuse a funeral... 
                         but that's it... do what you have to 
                         do, and get back or lose the deal, 
                         that's the deal. Your "ex" is already 
                         here in town, her lawyer is champing 
                         at the bit and the hearing is day 
                         after tomorrow, 1 PM.

                                     DON
                         Will this cover it? Overnight, plus 
                         today?

               He hands the black teenager some money. She shrugs...

                                     BLACK TEENAGER
                         I guess so...

               She opens the overhead latch to go out. Swish! Dad darts for 
               the door, squeezes in front of the girl... and he's gone!

                                     DON
                         Oh, God!
                              (on phone)
                         Later!

               Don drops the phone, and runs after him.

               EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

               Dad and Max moving fast, across the yard, through the fence, 
               and just about to cross the icy street, as Don catches up, 
               grabs Dad by the arm.

               Dad flails his arm free...

                                     DAD
                         You! You! You!

               Dad pokes his finger into Don's chest a half dozen times. 
               Don just takes it, as --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - ICY - DAY

               OUR VIEW - THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF A MOVING CAR,

               revealing the icy streets of the small town, -- tableau's of 
               changing America-people jogging, their breaths steaming in 
               the cold air, shoveling snow on driveways and paths, 
               "hometown" is in the air.

                                     DAD'S VOICE
                         ...no, no! That way. Don't you know... 
                         anything!? That way... no. no. no. 
                         Not ping. Nose. Nose! Can't you see... 
                         the man... the man... he's waiting... 
                         you me late. Making.

               ON DAD AND DON

               -- in the back seat of a limousine, dressed in dark suits 
               and coats.

               Dad is agitated, wide-eyed, gesturing wildly, this way and 
               that. Don is trying to maintain his cool.

                                     DAD
                         How can you... this way... it's THAT 
                         way. Turn that way!

                                     DON
                         Dad... he can't turn that way.

                                     DAD
                         No. Don't you know... the man... 
                         that way.

                                     DON
                         Who is this man? Just say his name.

                                     DAD
                         You know her name.

                                     DON
                         Her name? You mean your wife. My 
                         mother?

               Dad's eyes glaze over. Beat. Beat.

                                     DAD
                         Yes. Where is he?

                                     DON
                         Dad... don't you remember? She died. 
                         We're going to her funeral.

               Dad cocks his head like a puzzled puppy.

                                     DAD
                         Oh?
                              (a beat, he thinks)
                         Will she be there?

                                     DON
                         Yes, Dad, she'll be there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - WINTER - DAY

               A bright day, the sun glistening on the snowy ground, as the 
               caravan of just five or six cars led by the hearse and the 
               family limousine pull slowly around the rolling grounds.

               Some of the signs of the solemn side of Christmas in the 
               cemetery.

               THE BURIAL SITE

               The gravediggers help to unload the casket from the hearse 
               as the mourners take their places.

               GREEK ORTHODOX PRIEST

               In Greek or Latin:

                                     PRIEST
                         For the Markopoulis family and its 
                         friends, we gather in sorrow and to 
                         celebrate God's eternal way, to lay 
                         Gladys Spyros Markopoulis to her 
                         eternal rest...

               The priest continues on as --

               IN THE BACKGROUND, a taxicab pulls up, and a woman gets out 
               and hurries to join the crowd.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         My older sister, Cicely, the righteous 
                         bitch was always fashionably late, 
                         even to her mother's funeral. It's 
                         her Godgiven right to do as she 
                         pleases without caring about anyone 
                         else. She's perfect, and the rest of 
                         us are only there as flaws to allow 
                         her perfection to be seen by 
                         comparison. Luckily for her, she 
                         married a husband who can pay for 
                         the luxury of her perfection.

               Cicely arrives at the group, stands next to Don. Whispers 
               harshly for all to hear.

                                     CICELY
                         Why didn't you wait? Funerals don't 
                         have to start on time. You could 
                         have had them wait. My plane circled 
                         the city for an hour.

                                     DON
                         Oh.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Giving Cicely the satisfaction of an 
                         answer could result in a ten minute 
                         monologue on why I'm no good, and 
                         she's the only one on earth worth 
                         shit. That's why I limited my answer 
                         to one word. "Oh."

                                     CICELY
                         Is that the best you can say? "Oh." 
                         It's my mother's funeral, and all 
                         you can say is "oh." Well, of course, 
                         since you're the one who killed her.

                                     DON
                         Really. I thought she was killed by 
                         a Pontiac station wagon.

                                     CICELY
                         See. Jokes. At your mother's funeral. 
                         Where's Dad?

               The priest had been droning on, and only WE HAVE NOTICED 
               that DAD drifted away from the whispering siblings... and 
               now, when they both look around... he's gone.

               The two siblings each scan, turning their heads in opposite 
               directions and around their respective bodies, until their 
               heads meet on the backside with their eyes locked on the 
               same view.

               THEIR VIEW

               Dad, in the distance, just disappearing into the oldest part 
               of the cemetery.

                                     DON
                         He's looking for the man.

                                     CICELY
                         What man? This is no time to look 
                         for some man. It's his wife's funeral.

                                     DON
                         I'll get him.

                                     CICELY
                         Well, hurry up... how could you let 
                         him do this?

               Don slips away from the group, but not without notice, as 
               one, then all eyes, turn to his receding figure, as the Priest 
               goes on.

               HOLDING ON DON'S RECEDING FIGURE, AS:

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I was beginning to enjoy the sheer 
                         madness of it all. My Dad was no 
                         crazier than my sister, at least he 
                         had an excuse. I was starting to 
                         feel a connection with him -- 
                         something that I hadn't felt in a 
                         long time. It wasn't something I 
                         could put my finger on, not yet. All 
                         I knew for openers was that I wanted 
                         to help him find the man. My Dad was 
                         already in his second childhood, and 
                         you know what, I was jealous. I wanted 
                         to be in my second childhood too.

               DON disappears through the same place in the cemetery's old 
               section, where the tombstones are high and the uncaretaken 
               growth around them is even higher.

               EXT. IN THE OLD SECTION - DAY

               Don makes his way through the aisles of gravestones and 
               growth.

                                     DON
                         Dad? Dad?

               Don goes through the crowded area, passing by tombstones, 
               which we read as he goes by. These are the stones of the 
               long departed, some going back to the turn of the century 
               and before that.

                                     DON
                         Dad, where are you? Dad?

               He moves along, past tombstones, calling out for Dad, and 
               then --

               -- he trips and falls nearly flat on his face in the snow, 
               and from that vantage point, he looks up to see --

               Dad! Scurrying through, confused, scared.

                                     DON
                         Dad...!! Dad... stop!

               Dad, startled, stops in his tracks.

                                     DAD
                         How did you be?... looking for you.

               Dad comes over to him...and helps him get up out of the snow.

                                     DON
                         YOU were looking for ME? I was looking 
                         for you.

                                     DAD
                         Yes right... looking for you. Me 
                         too.

               ON DON, his head cocked now like a puzzled puppy.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I couldn't figure it out, was he the 
                         crazy man, or was I the crazy man?

               From nowhere, the voice of Cicely is unmistakable.

                                     CICELY
                         Oh, there you are... just like you. 
                         The funeral's not even over...

               Everyone from the funeral is there, all ten or twelve people, 
               ad-libbing that they hope everything's okay.

                                     DON
                         Um, don't worry... it's okay, my 
                         father just wanted to mourn in his 
                         own way, away from... you understand.

               And of course everyone says they understand except for Cicely, 
               as Don leads Dad along the way, and the whole crowd passes 
               by the old tombstones, and --

               HOLD ON ONE TOMBSTONE as everyone passes by, but does not 
               notice --

               IT READS

               Tyrus Markopoulis - Loving Son, Loving Father - 1866-1943.

               And then, PANNING as people pass by, but do not notice the 
               stone is next to the first one --

               SECOND STONE READS

               Boris Markopoulis - Loving son, Loving Father - 1905-1966.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Okay... I admit it. I was stupid. 
                         Dad had been looking for his own 
                         father's grave... and he found it 
                         but didn't see it. And neither did 
                         I. I didn't see it. I just didn't 
                         see it.

               EXT. MOM'S GRAVESITE - LATE DAY

               The cemetery workers are finishing the job of shoveling the 
               dirt into the grave over the coffin, as the mourners reemerge 
               from the Old Cemetery section in the deep background, with 
               the shrillness of Cicely's voice stinging the cold winter 
               air.

               ON CICELY

                                     CICELY
                         What was going on here? So stupid, 
                         at my mother's funeral. How can anyone 
                         mourn with crazy people all around? 
                         Don, it's really your fault...

               One of the mourners, a man Don's age, approaches him.

                                     VIC
                         Don... I'm Vic Hudnut... we were in 
                         Miss Troxell's fourth grade class 
                         together...

                                     DON
                              (trying to remember)
                         Oh... yes, hi, Vic.

                                     VIC
                         If there's anything, anything I can 
                         do... don't hesitate to call.

               Vic puts a business card into Don's lapel pocket, pats him 
               on the back for old times sake and he's gone before Don can 
               blink.

                                     CICELY'S VOICE
                         Really, Don... I have to catch the 
                         8:30 flight, and you've just ruined 
                         my Mom's funeral. Here, you take 
                         Dad.

               She moves Dad in to Don, and -- the waiting cab having pulled 
               up, opened its door... she's gone.

               Don's reaction as --

               PULLING BACK, BACK, BACK TO REVEAL

               Don and Dad and, of course, Max, standing together, alone, 
               and aimless in the vast cemetery.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

               Don's face, horizontal, his eyes wide open, staring ahead, 
               as morning light streaks across his face, and PULLING BACK --

               He is in his boyhood bedroom, and nothing has really changed. 
               Memorabilia of the mid-1980's- Michael J. Fox beams from a 
               poster of BACK TO THE FUTURE. Don as a member of the Duluth 
               High School track team. Skis. He's under a bedspread with a 
               racing car printed on it. His eyes roam the room and he 
               finally fixes on a big, no doubt purloined, burlesque 
               poster... ROSE LA ROSE, the Queen of Texas Burlesque... he 
               grins a little remembering the night he and his friends stole 
               off with the giant poster.

               Suddenly, the door bursts open.

               It's Dad, stark naked. Max by his side.

                                     DAD
                         He's gone. Not in the place.

                                     DON
                         Dad. Mom died. She's not coming back.

                                     DAD
                         He has the ticket.

               Don rises, sits on the edge of the bed.

                                     DON
                         Mom died, Dad. She's gone.

                                     DAD
                         He has the ticket.

               He turns, walks out. Max following.

               Don watches. The grin he wore for ROSE LA ROSE now replaced 
               by a sad grimace. He picks up the card he was given at the 
               funeral, and dials on his old Incredible Hulk dial phone.

                                     DON
                         Vic Hudnut please... oh, Vic, it's 
                         Don Markel... I hope it's not too 
                         early to call...
                              (Suddenly a CRASH is 
                              heard... maybe a pot 
                              or pan)
                         Vic... could you come by my Dad's 
                         house... well, as soon as you can... 
                         I have to get back for a court case 
                         in Portland... tomorrow.

               Another CRASH is heard.

                                     DON
                         Thanks... yeah... see you then.

               Don dashes out of the room... another crash is heard.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY

               Don runs into the kitchen. The toaster is in the sink with 
               the water running, causing electrical sparks and buzzes, but 
               Dad is not there.

               Another CRASH is heard, more distinctive, garbage cans and 
               hardware.

                                     DON
                         Oh, God.
                              (his eyes widen)
                         Dad!

               He runs out of the kitchen.

               EXT. THE ICY PATH TO THE GARAGE - DAY

               Crashing sounds, as Don slips and slides, falls, gets up and 
               enters through a side door.

               INT. THE GARAGE - DAY

               ON DON -- FROZEN in a stance of sheer terror.

               HIS VIEW --

               Dad is in the car, naked, driving back and forth, smashing 
               into the garbage cans and his old work shop machines, wooden 
               toys falling off the shelves above, then back into the wooden 
               garage door, cracking it. Max, the dog, is in the car too.

                                     DON
                         Dad... stop! Stop!

               Don tries to open the car door but Dad is locked in, and 
               doesn't hear him. We can see Dad talking to himself inside, 
               and then he sees Don trying to open the door, but pays no 
               attention. He crashes into the garage door, bam, and then 
               crashes again, wildly shifting the gear lever back and forth.

               Finally, Don gloms onto a shovel from nowhere, and with all 
               his might, he hits the back window of the moving car, but it 
               doesn't break. He keeps hitting it and hitting it, and doesn't 
               realize that the car has stopped and Dad, naked, has stepped 
               out of the car, and is watching Don curiously.

                                     DAD
                         Don't act crazy. Don't act crazy!!

               Don does a take, freezes the shovel above his head, and looks 
               at Dad.

                                     DAD
                         He's not in the place.

               Exhausted, Don exchanges a look with his Dad. His Dad gestures 
               meaninglessly. Relieved, Don mimics the gesture.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DAD'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Don has Dad into his underwear shorts and pants, and is 
               kneeling to put on socks and shoes.

                                     DON
                         Is this what Mom did for you everyday? 
                         And she kept it all a secret...

                                     DAD
                         I do my own!

               Dad kicks off the shoe.

                                     DON
                         Dad, please...

               The DOORBELL RINGS...

                                     DAD
                         Cut it out!

               The DOORBELL RINGS again.

                                     DON
                         JUST A MINUTE! I'll be there in a 
                         minute!!
                              (struggling with the 
                              shoe)
                         Come on Dad. Let me do this.

               He and Dad struggle some more, and he finally gets the other 
               shoe on...

                                     DON
                         Okay, now the shirt... and... we'll 
                         get you down for some breakfast...

               ON VIC HUDNUT

                                     VIC
                         Is this the one?

               ON SCENE

               As Vic enters the room, sees the problem, picks up Dad's 
               shirt and holds it open...

                                     VIC
                         Your Mom's house was always open, 
                         Don... just walk in -- cookies and 
                         hot chocolate --

               As Don directs Dad's arms into the sleeves.

                                     DON
                         How come you remember things, and I 
                         remember nothing... my Mom had 
                         cookies?

                                     VIC
                         You left town, Donny, and I stayed. 
                         So, I remember... even if you don't.

               They direct Dad out of the room. Max follows.

                                     DON
                         I thought you were a real estate 
                         agent, not a psychologist.

                                     VIC
                         Freud, that's who got us into all 
                         this hot soup... and Hitler... but I 
                         forgive them both...

               INT. THE KITCHEN

               Empty. Mom's chair is featured. The gallery wall in the b.g.

               As Don and Vic lead Dad into the room. Max too.

                                     VIC
                         Very few historians see the connection 
                         between Freud and Hitler. They were 
                         both just frustrated and angry men... 
                         like everybody else. What's for 
                         breakfast?

               They sit Dad down in the chair in front of the gallery of 
               snapshots. The water is still running over the now smoking 
               toaster in the sink. Don turns off the water, wipes off the 
               toaster while Vic forages in the refrigerator.

                                     DON
                         ...guess it won't be toast.

               Vic laughs.

                                     VIC
                         Guess not. But, here's some milk 
                         and... cereal... and orange juice...

                                     DON
                         Worth a shot.

               ON DAD --

               sitting motionless, expressionless, staring, and then, he 
               starts to blink curiously at his view.

               HIS VIEW -- MOM'S CHAIR --

               -- empty.

               BACK ON SCENE

               As Don puts the glass of juice in front of Dad, and Vic puts 
               a bowl of cereal in front of him.

                                     DON
                         Here, Dad... you have to eat.

               Dad stares ahead, blinking.

               ON MOM'S CHAIR -- empty.

               PULLING BACK FAST to Dad's hands as he suddenly sweeps across 
               the table, knocking the juice and the cereal all over the 
               place.

                                     DON
                         Oh, Dad, come on! Don't do that.

               Dad jumps up from the table and heads away. Don starts after 
               him.

                                     VIC
                         Let him go... he's okay. Here... 
                         check this out.

               Don spreads some papers on the kitchen table.

                                     DON
                         What's this?

                                     VIC
                         The listing. Sign here and the house 
                         will be listed and advertised right 
                         away. We'll price it, say, $15,000 
                         over the market... leave some room 
                         to negotiate.

               Suddenly Dad punches the window open, and throws out some 
               feed for the birds on the feeding station. The birds come 
               immediately. Max woofs and growls.

                                     DON
                         Vic... maybe we could just rent it 
                         out, the house out, until...

                                     VIC
                         Until when, Donny? -- you'll need 
                         the cash to pay the nursing home. 
                         Lots of cash.

               Don nods, takes the pen and signs. Sighs.

                                     DON
                         Dad... let's go see if we can find 
                         the man.

               Dad turns from the birds.

                                     DAD
                         ...is she there now? You know his 
                         bird?

                                     VIC
                         You go ahead... go see the man. I 
                         can clean up around here.

                                     DAD
                         The man... she's there now?

                                     DON
                         Yes, Dad... he's there now.

                                     DAD
                         Dokeyokey, you go.

               Dad turns to go, trips over Mom's chair, then straightens 
               the chair back to its exact original position. Max starts to 
               follow him. Vic grabs Max.

                                     VIC
                         Go ahead. I'll put the dog in the 
                         back yard.

               Don is ready to break into pieces. He nods to Vic, and takes 
               Dad out the door.

               HOLD on Mom's chair.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I didn't have the heart to tell Dad 
                         where he was going. I felt bad about 
                         tricking him... even though he...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE FAMILY CAR - DAY

               Don and Dad. Don at the wheel. Dad is seat-belted in.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         ...wouldn't know the difference... 
                         or maybe he would. I thought about 
                         how when I was seven years old... He 
                         asked me if I wanted to go to Camp 
                         Cherokee for the summer.

               DAD'S VIEW -- THROUGH THE WINDOWS

               Dad is looking around, turns his head.

                                     DAD
                         ...no, no, not the place. Where are 
                         you going... that way!

                                     DON
                         Okay, Dad... let's try it.

               Don takes a left hand turn, hometown nostalgia blurs through 
               the windshield.

               INTERCUTTING, DON AND DAD with the scenery

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         ...I said no to Camp Cherokee. I 
                         wanted to stay home... I had to stay 
                         home. I had to conquer riding my new 
                         bike, and I told him how important 
                         THAT was to me. So, he said, okay 
                         that we won't go to Camp Cherokee... 
                         we'll just take a ride in the country.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DAD'S HOUSE - DAY

               As Vic Hudnut says goodbye to Max the dog, shuts the door on 
               Max's sad look and gets into his car.

                                     DAD'S VOICE
                         Where you going!! ...not the place!! 
                         That way! You know which way it is! 
                         Why do you do it!!?

               BACK ON SCENE -- Dad and Don in the car, driving.

                                     DON
                         I'm trying to find the man for you, 
                         Dad.

               Don takes another turn... heading in a new direction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSERT:

               EXT. DAD'S HOUSE

               Quiet. Then, suddenly, a window is smashed open and Max jumps 
               through the flying shards, lands on his feet in the snow, 
               and takes off across the back yard and into the woods.

                                     DAD'S VOICE
                         For you? Why for you? The man can't 
                         wait... where is the ticket! The 
                         ticket! The ticket!

               Max disappears into the woods.

               BACK ON SCENE -- INSIDE THE MOVING CAR --

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Needless to say when we got to Camp 
                         Cherokee, I was beside myself. I 
                         yelled and screamed at my Dad! You 
                         tricked me! You tricked me! And I 
                         swore too. You tricked me... you... 
                         you... COMMUNIST! It was the worst 
                         thing anyone could call anyone else.

               Dad is getting very frustrated.

                                     DAD
                         You... don't... not this way! That 
                         way.

                                     DON
                         No, Dad, I'm pretty sure. It's this 
                         way.

                                     DAD
                         You! You! Never right! Stupid! 
                         Stupid... Turn... turn!

               Dad grabs the wheel and he and Don start struggling. Dad 
               strains to reach over the seat belt straps, and he has an 
               iron grip on the wheel.

               INTERCUT: On the streets, the car swerves, barely missing 
               another car. A truck honks! The car slides on the ice, bounces 
               off a tree and keeps going.

               INSIDE THE CAR, Don is pulling at Dad's hands, and they are 
               screaming at each other furiously.

               Don wins the battle, but now Dad keeps flailing at Don's 
               face.

                                     DAD
                         No good! You're not good! Bad! Bad 
                         boy!

               INTERCUT:

               Don, as a kid, rowing a boat like a demon in a race on the 
               lake at Camp Cherokee. Cheering spectators.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         That did hurt. No matter how old we 
                         are, I guess, we still want to show 
                         our Dad that we're a good person... 
                         not a bad person.

               ON DON, THE KID'S determined face, teeth gritted...

               BACK TO SCENE

               Don turns up a long graveled driveway towards an old mansion.

               Dad notices the long, snowy drive towards the mansion.

                                     DAD
                         ...this the place?

                                     DON
                         Yes, Dad, this is the place.

               Dad struggles violently to undo his seat belt, but he can't 
               figure it out.

               INTERCUT: CAMP CHEROKEE

               Don almost wins the race. He comes in second. The winner is 
               accoladed by the other kids and counselors. Don, the kid, is 
               alone in his rowboat, destroyed and alone in the crowd.

               BACK ON SCENE:

               The car pulls up in front of the mansion where a small sign 
               reads:

                      OLD OAKS-RETIREMENT HOME (Mentally challenged)

               Don helps Dad to undo his seat belt, and Dad bolts out of 
               the car... and despite Don's protest... scurries up the steps 
               of the portico... as a woman walks out.

               Don takes a deep breath behind the wheel, watching Dad through 
               the windshield.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Funny thing... even though I was 
                         really pissed about being tricked, I 
                         really had a great time at Camp 
                         Cherokee that summer. I won a boat 
                         race. But, I never bothered to tell 
                         my Dad. I wanted him to suffer for 
                         his crime.

               ON THE WOMAN, MRS. OAKLEY, THE DIRECTOR

               as Dad approaches her with purpose in his every step.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Mister Metropolis?

               Her greeting is warm, and Dad responds sociably. He smiles 
               and takes her offered hand, babbling incoherently as if he's 
               known her all his life.

               ON DON -- IN THE CAR --

               Don shakes his head in disbelief.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         That's another thing. Dad was always 
                         nicer to complete strangers than he 
                         ever was to me.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Well, come in, Mr. Metropolis.

                                     DON
                              (under his breath)
                         Mark-op-olus.

               Suddenly, Max appears!... in a great leap over a rocky wall, 
               dashes across the snow, joins Dad at his side with Mrs. Oakley 
               as they go in the front door of the Mansion.

               INT. THE NURSING HOME

               As Mrs. Oakley takes Dad by the arm. He feels comfortable 
               with her, as Don catches up...

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         ...You're also Mr. Metropolis?

                                     DON
                         I'm Don Markel. Mar-kel. My Dad's 
                         last name is Markopoulis.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Oh, I see. Please hold on to the 
                         dog... many patients are afraid of 
                         dogs. And you understand... of 
                         course...?

                                     DON
                         Oh... um... yes, of course.

               Don sees Max, does a take, looks around; takes Max by the 
               collar and tries to keep up.

               Mrs. Oakley walks them into the Activities Room. Antique men 
               and women wandering, sleeping, pretending to listen to the 
               Activities Director reading the newspaper to them.

               A remarkably spry and zaftig older woman in a sort of ragtag 
               nurse's outfit approaches.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Welcome to the Old-Timers ward. Your 
                         father has been diagnosed?

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Yes, Miss Cooper. Yes, senile dementia 
                         is Dr. Sidney's diagnosis.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         I'm so glad. That means he'll be in 
                         my care. Oho... how handsome and not 
                         tooo... old...

               She takes Dad's arm and cuddles him close to her substantial 
               old bosom. Dad's eyes pop. He likes it. He reaches out for a 
               feel; and she moves her bosom right into his hands. He latches 
               on to her bosom for dear life.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Miss Cooper, please. Mr. Metropolis 
                         still has to be admitted.

                                     NURSE COOPER
                         NURSE Cooper!

               Dad looks at his son, Don. Still holding 'Nurse' Cooper's 
               bosom. His eyes steely and far off.

                                     DAD
                         Good-bye.

               Don is taken aback. So sudden.

                                     DON
                         Dad... I want to see your room... 
                         and...

                                     DAD
                         Goodbye.

               Don's eyes start to cloud. He moves to kiss his Dad. Dad 
               holds on to one bosom while he flails his other arm violently, 
               pushing Don away.

                                     DAD
                         I told... GOOD-BYE. You!

               Don is hurt like a little boy, his eyes beginning to tear. 
               Dad flails his arms violently again and again, he pushes Don 
               away.

                                     DON
                         Dad. Why are you so angry with me? 
                         What did I do?

                                     DAD
                         ...this is the place.

               Now, Dad gives Don a mighty shove with both hands.

                                     DON
                         Dad... please... I need to know... 
                         why did you beat me up... when I was 
                         thirteen?

               Now Dad rushes Don full force, flailing at him mercilessly, 
               while Don uses his arms to cover himself without hurting his 
               father. Max is barking. Mrs. Oakley is yelling. Don is being 
               pummeled mercilessly, when --

                                     VIC'S VOICE
                         He beat you up? I don't remember 
                         that.

               It's Vic Hudnut. As usual, he's appeared from nowhere. Dad 
               stops the pummeling --

                                     VIC
                         I brought something for Dad's room. 
                         I hope it's okay. He loves birds... 
                         and I know they don't allow dogs.

               Vic produces a birdcage with two parakeets, on a stand.

               DAD grabs the birdcage and stand, and heads up the hallway 
               with Nurse Cooper on one arm, and Mrs. Oakley on the other.

               Max starts to follow, but Vic catches him by the collar. Max 
               whines.

               ON DON --

               breathless and shaken. Max's whining is HEARD OVER, allowing 
               US the impression that it could be Don who is whining.

               ON DON'S VIEW

               ...Dad disappearing down the hall and through a set of double 
               doors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. 747 - CABIN CLASS - NIGHT

               The "redeye", most people are sleeping in semi-darkeness, 
               but Don's face is spotlighted by the reading light above. He 
               stares ahead, his laptop computer on a musical notes screen 
               saver, waiting for his command.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I couldn't figure anything out. I 
                         never did know why my Dad had beat 
                         me up when I was thirteen and now he 
                         tried it again. My son, Richie was 
                         now thirteen and scheduled to tell 
                         the judge whether he wanted to live 
                         with his Mom, who was moving to 
                         Hawaii, or with me who he had only 
                         seen on some weekends and holidays 
                         for the last three years. And 
                         Christmas was only two days away. 
                         Then, it struck me that I hadn't had 
                         a moment to grieve the loss of my 
                         mother, and I wondered why I hadn't 
                         even shed a tear.

               On the computer, little dancing musical notes. Just a glimpse.

               The 'Old Timers' patients are at dinner, in various states 
               of dress, some are in hospital robes, but most are dressed. 
               It is a study in slow eating. They are having soup, and each 
               eats his or her own soup in his own way... just watching the 
               soup, lifting a spoon in an agonizingly slow process to the 
               lips, and one man, the man next to Dad is slurping his soup 
               very quickly. He might be ninety, skinny as a rail. Dad is 
               not eating his soup.

                         okay.

                         A good day. You had a ticket.

                                     SID
                         Best in town. How's your family.

                                     DAD
                         Best in town.

               Sid laughs loudly, upsetting some ladies.

                         Be quiet. You idiot.

                                     SID
                         Eat your soup, you old bitch.

               She gasps.

               Dad laughs. Sid nods knowingly.

                                     SID
                         You'll be okay. We can be buddies... 
                         or didn't you notice... we're the

                         Too bad, you!

                                     SID
                         Yeah... too bad is right.

               "Nurse" Cooper gets up, comes around the table to Dad.

                                     NURSE
                         Now, listen, Mr. Metropolis. You 
                         listen to me... it's almost bedtime, 
                         and I have a little extra time to 
                         tuck you in early. Would you like 
                         that?

               Dad looks up at her, blinking. She takes his hand and 
               practically lifts him out of his chair.

               The other women shake their heads and ad-lib their 
               disapproval. Sid can only grin wickedly.

               In the background, a few patients are putting gifts under 
               the Christmas tree.

               Dad is lying on his stomach in his bed. His shirt is off and 
               "Nurse" Cooper is now pulling off his pajama pants.

                         give you a full body sponge bath. 
                         Are you comfortable?

               Sid Graybar ambles into the room, pays little attention to

               AGENT" might be.

                                     NURSE
                         I'm giving him a full body 
                         examination, but I can't give you 
                         one. Doctor's orders.

                                     DAD
                         POW!

               She has gone a little beyond the thigh. Dad's head pops up 
               in a state of wide-eyed ecstatic surprise.

                                     SID
                         But see my side of the room. I have 
                         pictures of my wife and my sister, 
                         but you don't have any pictures.

               Nurse turns Dad over on his back. Now, her eyes pop.

                                     NURSE COOPER
                         Oh-oh. OoooOh. Look out. That's good, 
                         honey, That's very good!

               Quickly she throws a towel over his mid-section.

                                     SID
                         ...and you have family still living. 
                         You have two birds. But not me, I'm 
                         86 and I've outlived everybody I 
                         ever knew.
                              (Sid leans over 
                              parallel to Dad's 
                              face and into his 
                              eyes)
                         Nurse doing a good job on you?

               Dad gasps.

                                     SID
                         Do you know I'm here with the nuts 
                         in the Looney bin because I want to 
                         be.

                                     DAD
                         Yow-wa-eeee!

               Sid climbs into his own bed, just a few feet from Dad's.

                                     SID
                         Nobody brought me here. I brought 
                         myself because I didn't want to live 
                         alone. They didn't have a room for 
                         me in the Cody Wing... so they put 
                         me in here. I could've moved, but I 
                         like it here.

               A real nurse, Mrs. Russel, comes to the door.

                                     MRS. RUSSEL
                         Everybody tucked in. You need some 
                         help Mr. Metropolis?

               Dad gasps incoherently. Suspicious, Mrs. Russell enters 
               towards Dad. "Nurse" Cooper ducks down.

                                     MRS. RUSSEL
                         What's...? Oh, dear, Miss Cooper... 
                         This isn't right.

                                     NURSE COOPER
                         Sue me.

               She huffs past Mrs. Russel, with one last word at the door 
               as she escapes...

                                     NURSE COOPER
                         He only needs love.

               Mrs. Russel gives a last bedcheck to both Dad and Sid. She 
               puts a cover over Dad's naked body, tucks him in.

                                     MRS. RUSSEL
                         Well... tomorrow's another day.

               She goes, leaving FULL ROOM SHOT OF dad and Sid in the semi-
               darkness lying in their beds. Sid looks at the ceiling as --

                                     SID
                         It's too bad you didn't meet Herb. 
                         Well... of course, you couldn't meet 
                         Herb because he died last week... 
                         then of course if he hadn't died, 
                         you wouldn't be my new roommate 
                         because you're sleeping in Herb's 
                         old bed. But you woulda liked Herb.

                                     DAD
                         Bat for sincey... how date pile, 
                         ticket for the man... then man.

                                     SID
                         You're looking for the man?

                                     DAD
                         At the company... guess the birds... 
                         to go but boxes lost to wooden... go 
                         there.

                                     SID
                         To see the man.

                                     DAD
                         The man.

               MOVING IN on the parakeets in their cage...

                                     SID
                         Okay... but you can't worry about it 
                         now. Okay?

                                     DAD
                         Dokeyokey.

               The two parakeets are already sleeping.

               FADE OUT on the two parakeets.

               FADE IN:

               INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

               ON A JUDGE

                                     JUDGE
                         ...so each parent wants you to live 
                         with them... go to school. You've 
                         lived with your Mom for the last 
                         four years... why shouldn't you 
                         continue to live with her now?

               ON RICHIE -- Thirteen, bright, non-plussed.

                                     RICHIE
                         ...she's moving to Hawaii, but I 
                         want to play Hockey. They don't have 
                         hockey there.

               WIDER -- Hearing room includes Don and his lawyer, Mel, and 
               Susie, Don's ex, and her lawyer.

                                     JUDGE
                         So you want to live with your Dad, 
                         here in Portland, where they do have 
                         hockey? And some good schools, I 
                         might add.

                                     RICHIE
                         Well, maybe, but my Dad has to work 
                         every day and he lives in a little 
                         condo, but my Mom is rich... or her 
                         new fianc? is rich... and they are 
                         moving into a big house... and...

                                     JUDGE
                         So, you'd be better off there... 
                         she'll take you to school every day?

                                     RICHIE
                         Um... Well, she sleeps 'till eleven 
                         every morning, so, she can't take 
                         me... but I could take a cab.

                                     JUDGE
                         But, there's no hockey.

                                     RICHIE
                         Yes.

               Judge turns to the parents and lawyers.

                                     JUDGE
                         Now, which of you two really wants 
                         this boy?

               Both parents and both lawyers answer simultaneously.

                                     DON, SUSIE, MEL, HAL
                         I do. She does, your honor, he does, 
                         I do.

               The Judge looks at all of them.

                                     JUDGE
                         You ever hear of the wisdom of 
                         Solomon?

               They look at him blankly.

                                     JUDGE
                         Invoking the wisdom of Solomon... 
                         and knowing that Richie here can 
                         stay through New Year's to see how 
                         he likes living with his Dad...
                              (Susie gasps!)
                         For a change. He's been living with 
                         you for four years... and I really 
                         think the only person here capable 
                         of deciding who Richie should live 
                         with is...

               They all hang on his final word.

                                     JUDGE
                         Richie!

               With a sly and knowing grin, he brings the gavel down!

               They are all severally and individually dumbfounded, mouths 
               agape. Even Richie.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DON'S TWO ROOM CONDO - NIGHT

               It's small, but it has a great view of the city lights of 
               Portland, Ore. Good guess he's on the 20th floor of a downtown 
               high-rise condo building. Chic, but clinical. A tiny, plastic, 
               tabletop Christmas tree with a few gifts is a sad looking 
               concession to the holiday spirit.

               Don is couch-potatoing, doing three things at once, watching 
               the Blazers on TV, working some actuarial figures on his 
               laptop computer, and talking to Max, who lies on the floor, 
               watching him for his next move.

                                     DON
                              (to the Blazers)
                         ...good God, put the damn ball in 
                         the basket!! Oh, no... Jesus!

               It's half-time. Blazers lead by a point. He shakes his head, 
               starts typing, but Max is eyeballing him, and he feels it.

                                     DON
                         Hey! Max... don't look at me like 
                         that. I didn't create the situation. 
                         I just play the hand I'm dealt... 
                         and if I can play the hand I'm dealt 
                         so can you... 'cause you're a dog. 
                         Just a dog.

               The doorbell rings. His cell phone rings, too.

               He walks with the cell phone to the door, looks through the 
               peephole. Opens the door. The young woman in jeans and a 
               funny hat is there, this time with little girl in hand.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN (JAN PATRICK)
                         Hi... Mr. Markel?

                                     DON
                         Yes... oh, you're...

                                     JAN
                         Jan Patrick. My daughter, Bren. To 
                         meet Max.

               The phone buzzes insistently. He finally answers it.

                                     DON
                         Okay... you want to meet Max.
                              (on phone)
                         Don Markel. Oh... um... hold on.

                                     JAN
                         Is it okay...?

                                     DON
                         Sure. Max! Come here, Max.

               Max looks over the couch with a curious look on his wise dog 
               face.

                                     JAN
                         See, Bren, isn't he great?

               She goes to Max.

                                     JAN
                         Bren this is Max.

                                     BREN
                         I know...

               She smiles. They both pet Max, who is friendly but cautious.

               Don moves away into the kitchen area, with his back to them. 
               While Bren and Jan check out Max in the foreground.

                                     DON
                              (On phone)
                         Susie? Sorry... um... okay, so how 
                         do you want to arrange this... fine, 
                         he can stay with you tonite in the 
                         hotel, and I'll pick him up 
                         tomorrow... Yes, I've already got 
                         him the hockey stuff. Yes, I can 
                         afford it. Yes, I can afford the 
                         time... I'll make the time.

               He returns to the living area... carrying a leash and a dog 
               dish.

                                     DON
                              (to Jan and Bren)
                         You like Max?

               They nod...

                                     JAN
                         ...we need a big dog to protect the 
                         chickens from the mountain lions. 
                         Bren? You like Max?

                                     BREN
                         I love him. Mom...?

                                     JAN
                         Ok, yes... Mr. Markel?

                                     DON
                         Mountain lions... Max?

                                     BREN
                         Don't worry he's big... so they won't 
                         even try to fight him. Unless they're 
                         really hungry.

               Don's not sure, but nods anyway, and hands over the leash 
               and the dog dish.

                                     BREN
                         We also have a cat... and Max will 
                         love Greta.

                                     JAN
                         A cat named Greta.

                                     DON
                         I just can't keep a dog. It's a no 
                         pets building.
                              (into the phone)
                         Hold on, Susie... hold on.

                                     JAN
                         I understand. So, um, Merry Christmas.

               Don blinks. Oh, yeah, Christmas.

                                     JAN
                         Christmas. Tomorrow?

                                     DON
                         Uh, yes... Merry Christmas.

               Don gives Max a farewell pat on the head and ushers them 
               out. Watches them go down the hall. Max turns his head back 
               to look at Don, then continues down the hall with his new 
               owners.

               Way down the hall, at the elevator, Bren hugs Max, then hugs 
               her Mom. Don remains in the foreground on cordless phone in 
               hall.

                                     BREN
                         Oh, Mom, he's great. Thanks.

                                     DON
                         Susie... okay, so, it's O.K. I'll 
                         pick him up. Send his P.J's... ok?

                                     JAN
                         You're welcome. Have a good trip. 
                         Merry Christmas Aloha.

               They hug again and board the elevator.

               Don hangs up the phone. FOLLOW DON back into his condo.

                                     DON
                         Aloha. Ho. Ho. Ho.

               He plops back down on the couch. Scottie Pippen blocks a 
               shot.

               He looks at the TV with a glassy eyed stare. Sighs.

               Suddenly, with one sweeping, seething, flail of his arms, 
               like Dad, Don knocks everything off the coffee table, 
               including the sad little Christmas tree and gifts... and 
               seethes.

                                     DON
                         Jesus! What kind of a life is this?

               ON TV: Rasheed Wallace swoops through the air, and slam dunks.

               FADE IN:

               INT. DAD'S ROOM - OLD OAKS - DAWN

               ON THE TWO BIRDS... chirping at the DAWN.

               Dad is staring at the ceiling, wide-eyed, in the same position 
               as he went to bed.

               Sid is fast asleep.

               Dad hears the birds chirping. He gets out of bed, looks at 
               the birds, throws some seed on their little feeding station. 
               They eat, chirp, he grins.

                                     A VOICE
                         Merry Christmas.

               Dad grins, and responds... to the birds.

                                     DAD
                         Merry Chr... Chri...

               The voice belongs to a new nurse, a male nurse, Derrick, a 
               big black guy.

                                     DERRICK
                         Here I am, Mr. Macropoulis
                              (Dad whirls around)
                         Merry Christmas.

               Dad looks at him like he's crazy. Derrick picks up the phone 
               at bedside, holds the receiver in the air.

                                     DERRICK
                         It's your son. In Oregon.

               Dad blinks. Puzzled.

                                     DAD
                         Your son?

                                     DERRICK
                         No, your son, Don, in Oregon. He 
                         wants to wish you a Merry Christmas.
                              (Dad just blinks)
                         On the telephone.

               Dad just blinks. Sid sits up.

                                     SID
                         It's your son. On the telephone. 
                         Your son.

               Dad looks at Sid, looks at the phone.

                                     DAD
                         Oh... doo, your son.

               Dad takes the phone to his ear, but he's got it upside down. 
               We can hear Don trying to talk through the phone. "Dad, are 
               you there...?" Dad blinks, knocks the receiver a couple of 
               times on the edge of the bedside table to make it work.

                                     DERRICK
                         Here, try it this way.

               Derrick takes the receiver and turns it around correctly to 
               Dad's ear. We can hear Don's Voice trying to make contact.

                                     DERRICK
                         Say Hello.

               Dad can hear Don but he just blinks.

                                     DERRICK
                         Say Hello, Mister Macropoulis.

               Dad just blinks, not sure what to do.

               Sid rises up again, looks at Dad.

                                     SID
                         Say Hello to your son.

               Dad brightens, seems to understand Sid. What is it about 
               Sid?

                                     DAD
                         Say Hel-lo...!

               Derrick gives the high sign to Sid.

                                                       CUT AND INTERCUT TO:

               INT. DON'S HI-RISE APARTMENT - DAY

               INTERCUT WITH DAD'S ROOM ON PHONES

               Don is on the phone while in the background Richie is putting 
               on an array of hockey equipment... just out of the boxes. 
               Don has a cheap electronic keyboard that Richie gave him.

                                     DON
                         Dad... how are you doing there? Are 
                         they taking care of you?

               It's frustrating. Dad's voice is all mumbles.

                                     DON
                         I called to wish you a Merry 
                         Christmas. Merry Christmas.
                              (Dad's voice-incoherent)
                         I said... MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
                              (..."who?")
                         I'm with Richie on Christmas Day...

                                     DAD'S VOICE
                         You're bitchy?

                                     DON
                         Richie! My son. Your grandson. He 
                         wants to talk to you.
                              (to Richie)
                         Richie... it's Grampa.

               Don brings the phone to Richie's ear. Richie takes the phone.

                                     RICHIE
                         Hi, Grampa.
                              (Dad mumbles)
                         Huh? What did you say?
                              (Dad mumbles)
                         I can't understand what you are 
                         saying. Are you okay? How is Max?

               ON DAD:

                                     DAD
                         Sex. Yes... play.

                                     RICHIE'S PHONE VOICE
                         Your dog, Max. How is Max?

               ON DON, biting his lip, eager to take the phone.

                                     DAD
                         No attacks.
                              (to Sid)
                         She can't hear.

               Sid takes the phone.

                                     SID
                         Hello. This is Sid Graybar...

                                     RICHIE
                         Huh? ...oh, it's for you. Sid Graybar.

               Don grabs the phone.

                                     DON
                         Hello. Who is this?

                                     SID
                         I'm your Dad's roommate.

                                     DON
                         Oh, hi, how's he doing?

                                     SID
                         He and I are buddies. He's doing 
                         fine. He wants me to tell you and 
                         your boy... Merry Christmas.

               But Dad is already wandering out of the room, having trouble 
               with the doorknob. Finally, he gets it and goes out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PORTLAND RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Don and Richie, walking along the riverside park near the 
               great fountain. Richie is definitely overdressed in the pads 
               and uniform of a big time hockey player, the white goalie's 
               mask is worn by Don flipped up on his forehead, and he also 
               carries Richie's hockey stick and Richie's skates are carried 
               over Don's shoulder.

                                     RICHIE
                         ...but why didn't anyone tell me?

                                     DON
                         I did tell you, Rich.

                                     RICHIE
                         I mean then... WHEN she died.

                                     DON
                         Well, you were at your Mom's, and I 
                         think she probably felt it would be 
                         better if I told you.

                                     RICHIE
                         I'm never going to see my grandma 
                         again.

               A long pause. Don has his own feelings about his mother.

                                     RICHIE
                         Will I see Grampa again, Dad?

                                     DON
                         The truth?
                              (Richie looks at him. 
                              ...the truth, of 
                              course)
                         I don't know. In any case, you can 
                         tell, Grampa will never be the same 
                         person you knew.

                                     RICHIE
                         Yeah, I can tell. But, you know 
                         something, Dad. Grampa knows about 
                         life... and I'll bet he still knows 
                         how to have fun.

               Ahead of them is the ice-rink... and also, some people 
               walking... a dog.

               Don stops, does a take. Squints.

               Yep, it's the young woman, Jan Patrick, and her daughter and 
               another kid, walking a dog, and yep, the dog is Max.

                                     RICHIE
                         What about Grampa's dog... did they 
                         allow Max at the old folks home?

                                     DON
                         Un... no... um... I mean yes, yes 
                         they did.

                                     RICHIE
                         They did! That's really neat... Grampa 
                         loves that dog. They're... like, 
                         married.

               The woman and kids and Max go into the enclosure of the 
               outdoor skating rink.

                                     DON
                         Um, Richie... it's getting awfully 
                         cold, and... um... I forgot to tell 
                         you...

                                     RICHIE
                         ...forgot what...?

                                     DON
                         ...um... to tell you... I'm not really 
                         feeling that well, and... um... we 
                         have that party to go to... we'll 
                         just have to do hockey... um... 
                         tomorrow.

                                     RICHIE
                         But, Dad, I'm taking a lesson. Mr. 
                         Bolton is waiting... That party is 
                         tonite.

               Max and the woman and kids are getting closer. Don physically 
               turns Richie around and heads the other direction.

                                     DON
                         Richie, I'm getting really sick... I 
                         have to go back to the condo... I'm 
                         really sick.

                                     RICHIE
                         Yeah. I think you're having your 
                         period.

               Don gives him a funny look, and pushes him along.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I'd lied to my son, and... don't 
                         think I didn't feel bad about it. 
                         But why? Richie could handle the 
                         truth. Hah! O.K. I got it. I'm the 
                         one... who couldn't handle the truth.

               ON JAN PATRICK --

               with Bren and Max, the dog, and a couple of other kids, her 
               eye caught something at a distance... Don having turned and 
               walked the other way with Richie... she stops, wonders, then 
               joins the others again...

               INT. THE LIVING ROOM - OLD OAKS - DAY

               Almost all the patients are just sitting and sleeping in 
               chairs. A big Christmas tree dominates the room.

                                     DERRICK
                         All right, everybody. Perk up... 
                         we're going to light the Christmas 
                         tree... and it's almost 2 o'clock... 
                         visitors and singing... and gifts...

               He turns the switch to light the big tree, which is beautiful. 
               Most everyone looks spacey-eyed at the tree, and one woman 
               applauds a little.

               Sid and Dad sit together amongst fifteen women.

                                     SID
                         That's nothing. I've seen better. 
                         That's nothing.

               Dad nods his agreement.

                                     SID
                         We could have some real fun if they'd 
                         let us.

                                     NURSE COOPER
                         Something naughty.

               Dad nods. Sid looks at her.

                                     SID
                         You're not included.

               She sticks her nose up indignantly.

                                     NURSE COOPER
                         You've gotten your share of sponge 
                         baths from me.

                                     DAD
                         Ho-ho-ho.

               They look at Dad. Sid and Nurse do a take.

                                     NURSE
                         Ho-ho-ho.

                                     SID
                         Ho-ho-ho... Merry Christmas.

               Several middle-aged people and a few kids are trooped in 
               through the main hallway into the living room, bearing 
               Christmas gifts... They spread out to their mothers and 
               grandmothers, "Merry-Christmas" ing as they go.

               Nurse and Dad giggle.

               EXT. A COUNTRY HOUSE - DECORATED - OREGON - NIGHT

               Richie and Don are trekking in the rain with an umbrella, 
               gifts in hand towards the house. So is another father and 
               his daughter.

                                     RICHIE
                         I don't get it, Dad. If you don't 
                         know anybody... who do you give the 
                         gifts to?

                                     DON
                         We just put 'em under the tree. I 
                         give mine to any Mom, and you give 
                         yours to any other kid.

                                     RICHIE
                         And you don't even know 'em? How do 
                         you know these people?

                                     DON
                         I saw it in the newspaper. It's for 
                         single parents and their kids.

               They ring the doorbell. Someone answers immediately. And 
               overweight earth mother with a big smile.

                         Hi... I'm Nan. Merry Christmas.

               She hugs Don and then hugs Richie. They look at each other.

                                     NAN
                         Come on in... put your gifts under

                         Hi... Merry Christmas !

               Betty and Peter take turns hugging Don and Richie, who see 
               each other over the shoulders of the huggers and exchange 
               wide-eyed pleas of helplessness.

               They stop hugging and three more people line up.

                                     THREE PEOPLE
                         Merry Christmas...!

               INT. LIVING ROOM - OLD OAKS - LATE DAY

               Everyone, old patients, dressed up on their 40's and 50's, 
               their children, nurses, Mrs. Oakley, gifts have been 
               exchanged. The patients try on their new sweaters and warm 
               booties. Some have been given toys, rubber balls to squeeze, 
               a slinky, and --

               Mrs. Oakley is at the piano, leafing through a book of 
               Christmas Carols.

                                     SID
                         Look... I got a tie. My nephew in 
                         North Dakota. He's seventy-two... 
                         and you thought I didn't have any 
                         living relatives. I think I gave HIM 
                         this tie... fifteen years ago. What'd 
                         you get?

                                     DAD
                         More... today.

               Dad opens a little jewel box, and pulls out his treasure. 
               It's a Fashion Condom. Dad doesn't seem to know what it is.

                                     SID
                         Who gave you THAT?

               From across the room, "Nurse" Cooper winks.

                                     SID
                         Where did SHE get it?

               Derrick has a grin on his face. He shrugs.

               Dad blinks, puzzled. Thinking. Thinking. Thinking.

                                     DERRICK
                         She asked.

               Mrs. MacKay, a patient who has always looked curious, reaches 
               out to Dad... takes the condom from his hand to inspect it, 
               then passes it along to another patient... Dad is not sure 
               he likes what they are doing.

               ON SCENE -- AT THE PIANO

               MRS. OAKLEY IS AT THE PIANO, AND ONE, AND TWO - AND -

                         Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a 
                         little shiny nose and if you ever 
                         saw him you would even say it glows...

               She starts to play and sing... and the crowd is slow to join 
               her, but the sing-a-long picks up as:

               ...the condom is passed around the circle of senile 
               inspectors, none quite sure what it is, as Dad's eyes follow 
               the condom from hand to hand in the circle --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Similar scene with younger people. Gifts opened and tried 
               out and worn.

               Don and Richie are on the periphery of the sing-along carolers 
               around the piano. Don's gift is opened and in hand, it's 
               Natural Oatmeal Soap, nicely packaged. Richie is holding a 
               Barbie doll... negotiating a trade with a little girl for 
               the Action Figure she has in hand.

                                     GIRL
                         I have six Barbies! And I LIKE Action 
                         Man. I feel sorry for you and all 
                         but... what can I do?

               Richie shrugs. They move in closer... towards the piano 
               player, who sits with her little girl on the bench, playing 
               and singing.

               She turns to Don. It's Jan Patrick.

                                     JAN
                              (in between notes)
                         Hi, there. Mr. Markel.

               Don gulps. Richie does a take.

                                     JAN
                         You should see Max. He's great. He 
                         barks at everybody,... he's very 
                         protective of us.

               Don smiles wanly. Richie is puzzled, thinks about it.

                                     JAN
                         Look! You got MY gift. See, it says 
                         "from Jan."

               Don nods weakly. Richie is starting to get it.

                                     JAN
                         And... I think I got YOURS! Yes? 
                         Chanel... how nice.

               She holds up a tiny bottle of Chanel eau d'toilet. Don nods 
               uncomfortably as Richie gives him a sadly puzzled, dirty 
               look, and moves back and away into the crowd. Don doesn't 
               know which way to go. Jan gets his attention to sing-a-long.

               A short Conga Line has started, those few able bodies have 
               joined in the Conga Line, singing, circling through the living 
               room, singing. Dad and Sid included... and just as another 
               chorus is sung, Nurse Cooper joins the group from down the 
               hall... and she holds up her prize -- The birdcage with Dad's 
               two parakeets.

               Cheers. She has scored a triumph with the crowd, and they 
               continue to dance around and sing.

               Dad looks funny... and moves to Nurse.

                         His dolls. His dolls.

               Dad reaches for the cage. She pulls it away.

                         We're just having fun.

               Agitated, Dad takes a swipe at the cage. She pulls it away. 
               taunting him. He takes another swipe.

                                     DAD
                         His dolls!! His!

               He lunges and grabs the cage from her. Both Dad and the cage 
               crash to the floor.

               The birds fly out...

               Chaos reigns. The nurses come to Dad's aid. Nurse Cooper is 
               shouting her defense. The singing stops. The patients are 
               frightened. The bird fly around through the people. Screaming.

               One of the birds lands on Mrs. Oakley... she shrieks and the 
               bird takes off. The nurses are chasing the birds. The birds 
               are squawking.

               Sid takes Dad's hand -- and just as they are about to reach 
               the door, Dad dashes over to the circle of patients, grabs 
               the condom as it's being passed by one gnarled hand to another 
               gnarled hand... and he's gone.

                         That's the sanest thing you've ever 
                         said.

               The cloak room is there. Sid takes two overcoats, hands one 
               to Dad... and two scarves.

                                     SID
                         LET'S GO HAVE FUN!

               Dad grins nervously, but follows Sid to the front door... as 
               in the background, Derrick is on a chair coaxing one of the 
               birds down from the chandelier.

               Two men with Santa Hats walk out the front door. Sid and 
               Dad.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD OAKS - NIGHT

               It's snowing.

               Sid and Dad walk through the front gate and along the 
               neighborhood sidewalk.

               ON DAD AND SID WALKING

                                     DAD
                         ...go... go.

                                     SID
                         Go. Where? We'll go to see the Man. 
                         Want to find the man?

                                     DAD
                         Ticket... see the man.

               Dad smiles at Sid, bumps into a street lamp. Sid turns him 
               around and they go.

               It's a real Christmas night. Snow glistening on the ground, 
               neighborhood street lamps casting the long shadows of leafless 
               trees.

               One lone car is coming, it's headlights bright on the icy 
               street. It's very slippery and the car moves at a snails 
               pace. It's actually a mini-pickup truck...

               The street lamp casts the long shadows of Two Men Walking 
               then picking up a little speed --

                                     SID
                         Hey, remember... ...we were kids!

               Sid just fast enough to get behind the pickup truck, secretly 
               grab on to its back gate, and planting his feet just right, 
               Sid skates on the icy street. Dad loves it, and once Sid is 
               secured, Dad hurries to take a ride too.

               OUR VIEW rides with them as they ride with joyous smiles.

                                     SID
                              (singing)
                         Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle 
                         all the way...!

                                     DAD
                         ...ingle -- boy-the way.

               NEW ANGLE --

               EXT. LOCAL THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

               FROM THIS ANGLE, it's a quiet night on the thoroughfare, and 
               the street isn't icy, unlike the icy side street which 
               intersects it. Just now, coming gingerly towards us on the 
               side street is the Mini-pickup truck, and when it gets to 
               the intersection, it turns! Sent siding and sprawling into a 
               big embankment piled at the side of the road are it's 
               riders... Sid and Dad.

               ON THE SNOW BANK,

               Dad and Sid are sprawled with ecstatic and exhausted smiles 
               on their faces, catching their breath.

               Finally. Dad mumbles something and Sid agrees.

                                     SID
                         See. There's still life in the old 
                         boy.

               Dad is tracking something.

               HIS VIEW:

               It's a city bus coming up the thoroughfare.

               Dad jumps up. Starts running for the bus.

                                     DAD
                         Go... go. Home.

               Dad waves the bus down and the bus stops for him well before 
               the bus stop.

               The bus door opens, the Black DRIVER is in uniform except 
               for a Santa Hat just like Dad's:

                                     DRIVER
                         Merry Christmas, Brother Claus.

                                     DAD
                         Therr -- stmash.

                                     DRIVER
                         You are smart not to be drinking and 
                         driving. Hop on board, Mr. Claus.

               Dad gets on halfway through the door... mumbles something 
               excitedly, holds the door open.

                                     DRIVER
                         No problem... I'll wait.

               Huffing as fast as his old legs will allow, Sid hustles up 
               the street and onto a bus.

                                     SID
                         Merry Christmas...

               The driver shuts the door and the bus goes.

               INT. THE BUS - NIGHT

               Dad has gone to the back of the bus, but Sid, also in his 
               Santa hat, tries to find some change in his pocket.

                                     SID
                         ...Ooops... looks like I'm an 
                         embarrassed Santa.

                                     DRIVER
                         Oh, hell... it's Christmas. Don't 
                         worry about it.

               Sid pats his fellow Santa on the shoulder and moves to the 
               back of the bus with Dad. Except from them, the bus is empty. 
               They sit quietly next to each other.

               Dad grins devilishly.

                                     SID
                         What's up?

               Dad opens his clenched fist. Grins. In his palm is the Fashion 
               Condom.

               Sid smiles, grabs for it playfully; but Dad clinches his 
               fist. Holds it tight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OLD OAKS - NIGHT

               The Christmas guests are just saying their goodbyes, kissing 
               their loved ones, saying good-bye to the nurses and the 
               smiling Mrs. Oakley at the front door.

               Quickly, the regular patients are once again alone, making 
               way with their aluminum walkers amidst the after math of 
               wrapping paper, napkins, paper plates of the party.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Well, I hope you will all agree... 
                         it was a wonderful Christmas... and 
                         now it's 7:30 and I'm sure you're 
                         all tired, and I know those staff 
                         members not on duty would like to 
                         get home...

               The old folks start moving back to their rooms, slowly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CITY STREET - NIGHT

               The City Bus moves up the street and pulls up to a bus stop.

               ON THE BUS' DOOR...

               ...as it opens and Sid gets out. Dad was behind him, but Dad 
               suddenly runs to the back of the bus. The bus driver shuts 
               the door and takes off.

               Sid watches as the bus moves up the street, then stops, then 
               backs up all the way back to Sid.

               ON THE DOOR --

               -- as it opens and Dad is standing there. He just stands 
               there...

                                     DRIVER
                         Okay, now. Merry Christmas. Make up 
                         your mind... in or out.

                                     SID
                         Okay, I'll get back in.

               He gets in. So Dad gets out. Dad's outside and Sid is inside.

                                     DRIVER
                         Okay, is that it? What street do you 
                         want?

                                     SID
                         Hey, roomie, get back in.

               Dad stands in the snow, puzzled, looks around. Then he points 
               down the side street.

                                     DAD
                         Home...

                                     SID
                         Home? This is where you live?

               Dad gets excited, points down the street!

                                     DRIVER
                         Look, I understand. You guys have 
                         had one too many... but you have got 
                         to make up your minds.

               Dad had run and slipped and slided down the street... so Sid 
               shrugs and stumbles off the bus after him.

               The driver rolls his eyes, shuts the door, and drives off.

               ON DAD

               As Sid runs towards him. Dad is standing next to someone's 
               garbage cans. He picks up the garbage can covers from two 
               cans, and has a gleam in his eyes.

                                     SID
                         Wait for me.

               Dad barely waits for Sid as he throws one of the garbage can 
               covers on the ground and jumps on to it, leaves the other 
               can cover behind as he starts sliding down the hilly suburban 
               street, picking up steam as he goes, looking back to Sid 
               with a crazy smile.

               Sid watches, calls after him.

                                     SID
                         Hey, don't do that. It's dangerous.

               He's not heard. He picks up his garbage can cover, shrugs,

                                     SID
                         Okay, the nuts have taken over the 
                         looney bin.

               He gets on his can cover, and we watch him follow Dad down 
               the long hill of Christmas decorated fine homes.

               They are screaming into the cold silent night as --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OLD OAKS - DAD AND SID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Mrs. Oakley, dressed in her overcoat, the O.D. nurses, Mrs. 
               Russel and Derrick and one or two onlooker patients are 
               standing in the room with two made and unfettered beds.

               The parakeets are back in their cage, and the cage is taped 
               shut with silver plumbers tape.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Okay, let's go through this once 
                         more. They were both seen when the 
                         problem began.

                                     MRS. RUSSEL
                         Mr. Metropolis... yes.

                                     DERRICK
                         It got so crazy...

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Well, they are definitely not HERE... 
                         so we'd better call the police again.

               They shrug and look at each other collectively, as:

               EXT. A BIG CIRCA 1930'S CRAFTSMAN STYLED HOUSE - NIGHT

               The view is like a picture postcard, decorated and lighted 
               with flashing lights, a big Christmas tree in the living 
               room window. Otherwise the house is dark.

               ON SID AND DAD

               Standing, looking, their garbage can sleds just behind them.

                                     SID
                         THIS is where you live?

                                     DAD
                         Go...

                                     SID
                         Okay, let's go.

               They trek up the steps...

               ON THE FRONT PORCH

               As they arrive...

                                     SID
                         I didn't know you were rich. You got 
                         the key?

               Dad looks at the big front door, nods his head like a mystic, 
               and reached up and over one of the porch lights, and... 
               viola... produces the key. Hands it to Sid, with a big grin.

               Sid opens the door, and swings the door open.

               They walk in.

               INT. THE BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

               It is a beautiful traditional home, replete with Craftsman 
               1930's furniture, Tiffany lamps, and... in the living room, 
               the huge Christmas tree with dozens of already opened gifts 
               left under it and around the living room.

                                     SID
                         See what a nice family you've got. 
                         Gifts everywhere.

               They look around, Sid takes Dad's arm and leads him through 
               the foyer, and as they go, Sid stops Dad short.

               They are standing under a sprig of mistletoe.

               Sid looks at Dad, who is confused, and Sid gives him a buss 
               on the cheek... Dad grins, and they continue in.

                                     SID
                         This is the best friggin' Christmas 
                         of all.

               Dad nods.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               PANNING A WALL FULL OF SNAPSHOTS... not unlike the gallery 
               of snapshots on Dad's kitchen wall at his real home.

                                     SID'S VOICE
                         Ding. Ding. Ding.
                              (imitating Mrs. 
                              Oakley's soprano)
                         It's dinner hour. Dinner everyone.

               DAD AND SID ARRIVE INTO FRAME.

               Sid points out the gallery of snapshots.

                                     SID
                         Nice family. That your wife? And 
                         your son, nice lookin' man, and that's 
                         your grandson. Nice. Here, you sit, 
                         I'll get dinner.

               Dad sits as Sid moves to the refrigerator.

                                     SID
                         No picture of you, I see... just 
                         like my family, I took all the 
                         snapshots, so I'm never in any 
                         pictures.

               Dad's eyes are focused on something.

               DAD'S VIEW

               One of the chairs at the kitchen table is on an angle. Dad 
               moves the chair to resemble the angle of MOM'S CHAIR at his 
               real home.

               Sid moves to the table with an array of foods. The basic 
               food groups. Grapes, lettuce, two half gallons of ice cream, 
               two different flavors, and a big jar of pickles.

                                     SID
                         That's what I hate about Old Oaks. 
                         You have to eat what they give you.

               Sid accidentally bumps Mom's Chair out of its position, starts 
               to sit. Dad quickly moves the chair back to its Mom's chair 
               position. Sid blinks, decides not to sit there, and sits in 
               another chair, starts to serve the food.

                                     SID
                         Now we can find out just how come 
                         pregnant women love to eat ice cream 
                         and pickles.

               And he serves ice cream and pickles onto Dad's plate.

               Dad starts to eat a pickle, dips it into the ice cream and 
               eats it. He takes another long look at Mom's Chair, as we --

               Mrs. Oakley with two police officers, and other officers 
               looking around the grounds in the b.g. with flashlights. 
               Three police cars are in the driveway, with flashing lights.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         ...now that I think of it, two of 
                         our Christmas party visitors, Mr. 
                         Sweeney, and Mr. Fiedler both reported 
                         their overcoats missing...
                              (referring to notes)
                         ...one a long, brown gabardine, and 
                         the other a tweedy grey.

               The Police Officer takes notes.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Is it possible that they might not 
                         have walked off... but were taken 
                         home by their families...?

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         ...Well, Mr. Graybar has no family, 
                         and Mr. Markopolis... just got here... 
                         ...maybe they went "home" to Mr. 
                         Metropolis's house... Um, Nurse 
                         Cooper, thank you, everything's under 
                         control here.

               Nurse Cooper has stuck her nose out the front door. And she 
               goes back in with a huff at Mrs. Oakley's insistence.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         We're checking out Mr. Markopoulis's 
                         house... but if they're not there, 
                         we're going to have to put out a 
                         news bulletin.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Oh, dear, that would be negative 
                         publicity for Old Oaks.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         I understand... hopefully they'll 
                         turn up in the next hour or two.

               A piece of mistletoe hangs over their heads. Mrs. Oakley 
               gives the officer a little peck.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         I couldn't resist.

               The officer smiles, tips his cap, and --

               Vic is guiding two policemen through the house IN ONE FLUID 
               CAMERA SHOT. Vic talks nervously and the cops say nothing.

                                     VIC
                         This is the kitchen. Dining Room... 
                         it's a Bert Norris built house... 
                         1945, so you know it was well built 
                         if you know Bert Norris' reputation... 
                         but, hah, here I am trying to sell 
                         you the house... when you're looking 
                         to find out if... Mr. Markopoulis 
                         tried to come home. You say he's 
                         with Sid Graybar. I thought Sid 
                         Graybar died... his daughter died 
                         five years ago. I sold the house.

               They inspected most of the house. Cop talks into a Cellular 
               Walkie Talkie.

                         Officer Burton. We're at the house 
                         on Dalton Street. No sign of them 
                         here. Over
                              (radio voice)
                         Okay... we'll scout the bus station. 
                         Over. Out.
                              (to Vic)
                         Thanks for your trouble.

               Vic nods.

               EXT. THE FINE HOUSE - ANOTHER HOMETOWN TABLEAU - DAWN

               The Christmas decorations are bright in the dark of the dawn 
               until, within a few seconds, a big orange ball rises over 
               the hill, and the dark turns to light.

               INT. THE HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAWN

               Dad is asleep sitting up in his chair at the kitchen table. 
               One of the two gallons of ice cream has tipped over and its 
               melted creamy contents are spilled on the table. The lettuce 
               is wilted. The pickle jar is empty.

               A P.A. Amplified Voice fills the air with a Big Voice from 
               nowhere.

                                     P.A. VOICE
                         HELLO. TESTING. TESTING. THIS IS THE 
                         VOICE OF YOUR CONSCIENCE. YES, I 
                         MEAN YOU. THIS IS THE VOICE... OF 
                         'THE MAN.'

               Dad's eyes pop open. The VOICE continues:

                                     SID'S V.O.
                              (The P.A.)
                         THE VOICE OF THE MAN KNOWS ALL... 
                         EVEN THOSE THINGS YOU NEVER TOLD 
                         NOBODY.

               Dad's eyes pop open more. He looks around. Nobody. Sid's 
               gravelly old voice continues:

                                     SID'S V.O.
                         AND EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE SENILE NOW 
                         AND CONFUSED, YES, I, THE VOICE OF 
                         THE MAN KNOWS THAT YOU CAN STILL 
                         THINK AND REMEMBER AND FEEL THINGS.

               Dad is really frightened. He starts to tremble and look to 
               the ceiling.

                                     DAD
                         ...I didn't mean... who... you have 
                         the ticket?

                                                       CUT AND INTERCUT TO:

               INT. THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Sid is by the Christmas tree, trying out one of the gifts, a 
               Karaoke Sing-A-Long System, now being used like an amplified 
               bullhorn. It bellows.

                                     SID
                              (on bullhorn)
                         YES... I HAVE THE TICKET. I KNOW 
                         EVERYTHING. HAVE YOU BEEN GOOD OR 
                         BAD IN YOUR LIFETIME?

               Dad's VOICE is heard from the kitchen.

                                     DAD'S VOICE
                         ...good! good! No... bad.

                                     SID
                              (on bullhorn)
                         THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'VE BEEN BAD.

               IN THE KITCHEN, Dad is unnerved. He thinks this is IT! The 
               end of it all.

                                     DAD
                         No. Please... good. Please. Good.

               Dad has been looking for The Voice, and he now starts to 
               walk into the living room.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM --

                                     SID
                         HOW GOOD? HAVE YOU EVER HUGGED YOUR 
                         KIDS?

               Dad wanders into the room, listening to the voice, and even 
               though he sees Sid with the Sing-A-long toy, he doesn't get 
               it.

                                     DAD
                         My woman... ice cream.

                                     SID
                         HMMM. THAT'S... BAD. Oops!

               He sees Dad standing right in front of him, puts down the 
               sing-a-long bullhorn.

                                     DAD
                         I... I... I... he... he...he.

                                     SID
                         Who? Who? Who? The man... the man 
                         came?

               Dad nods. Nodding very low, then nodding very high. Nodding...

                                     SID
                         Oh, yeah... what'd the man say?

               Dad points to himself, fingering his own chest several times.

                                     DAD
                         ...good, good.

                                     SID
                         You're a GOOD man?

               Dad nods his head, yes, yes, yes.

                                     SID
                         Well, you must be a good man... 
                         because... did you see how many 
                         presents your family has given you.

               Sid gets up, takes Dad by the hand, and they go over to the 
               tree, sit on the floor with all the gifts. There are the 
               gifts for the family, some for Mom, some for Dad, some for a 
               boy about 12, and some for a girl about 8.

               MONTAGE SEQUENCE: OUR THEME IS UP, AS:

               Sid and Dad play with the gifts.

               1. They try on some clothes and hats. Sid puts a great, warm 
               sweater on Dad. Dad puts a fir hat on Sid's head. They stay 
               this way throughout.

               2. Play with a radio controlled Ford Explorer SUV from room 
               to room. Dad runs the car from a battery operated remote in 
               his hand... and Sid runs after the car from room to room. 
               Just as Sid reaches the car and starts to pick it up, Dad 
               his the button and the car zooms away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Don is packing a suitcase and talking on the phone at the 
               same time.

                                     DON
                              (on phone)
                         O.K., that's great... you'll buy the 
                         non-taxable muni's -- pay seven and 
                         a scrosh... you get the warrants 
                         thrown in... and you let you IRA 
                         sell Yahoo for the year end tax 
                         loss... and you go into the new year 
                         looking at a carryover.

               Richie walks by him again on the return, silently. Sit on 
               the opposite side of the room, with his back turned.

                                     DON
                         Okay, John, Happy New Year... I'll 
                         call tomorrow too. You, too. Thanks.

               FLUID CAMERA FOLLOWING

               Don hangs up, closes the suitcase, looks at his watch. walks 
               into the kitchen, past Richie, without a word Don opens the 
               refrigerator, bachelor empty, takes out a 7-Up.

                                     DON
                         Are you packed?
                              (no answer)
                         Want a soda?

               No answer. He shrugs, walks back.

                                     DON
                         Look, Richie, this is an emergency... 
                         I would really appreciate it if you'd 
                         make it a little easier.

               No answer from Richie.

                                     DON
                         Okay... I know it's not easy. So, if 
                         you feel like you need to choose to 
                         live with your Mom, I'll understand.

               No answer from Richie. In fact, Richie's grim deadpan look 
               could kill.

               Don just looks out the window. On the street below, a cab is 
               just pulling up.

                                     DON
                         Okay. The cab is here.

               He picks up his suitcase and heads out the front door.

               He waits for Richie. Richie takes his time, picks up his 
               backpack and his hockey stick, and makes his way to the door, 
               passes his father within inches without a word.

               Don sighs and closes the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dad and Sid continue the silent but for MUSIC OVER MONTAGE, 
               now they --

               3. Smash balls. Dad and Sid hit a soft rubber balls hard as 
               they can with wooden paddles, but it only floats through the 
               air, and they run to hit it... back and worth... back and 
               forth just missing several disasters, and then like two 
               outfielders running for the same ball in the air, they smash 
               into each other, and pratfall to the carpet, exhausted and 
               happy.

               4. Dad is dressing a Barbie doll, and loves it. Sid comes 
               over with a big GI-Joe action figure and the two dolls start 
               talking to each other in Barbie and GI Joe talk. 'Oh, hi I'm 
               Barbie.' 'Okay, I like your boobs.' Then, in fun, the two 
               dolls start fighting, as --

               It's a smaller interior, but again Don is crushed into his 
               seat, surrounded by larger people. Richie sits in an aisle 
               seat three or four seats away.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I wished I hadn't lied to my son 
                         about Max. I wished my Mom hadn't 
                         died. I wished my Dad hadn't become 
                         senile and nutty. I wished Richie 
                         would decide to live with me, ...but 
                         I felt relieved by that Judge... I 
                         didn't have to make the decision. I 
                         wished I was making more money. I 
                         wished I lived on a farm or in Paris. 
                         I wished I wasn't on an airplane 
                         going back to Duluth again. I wished 
                         I had a better life. And I wished 
                         that wishing would make it so, because 
                         even with all that wishing, I didn't 
                         feel better about anything. So, ring 
                         in the damn new year. Might as well. 
                         Happy F-word New Year.

               Richie is looking at him, also wishing something. Don feels 
               his eyes... looks to Richie, smiles a little, and Richie 
               quickly averts his eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               5. Sid picks up a video cassette, it's a home movie cassette 
               "To Jerry, from: Your 'LOVING' Wife." He puts it into the 
               VCR.

               They sit, stare at the TV with jaws agape.

               ON TV: It's the wife (see snapshots in kitchen) and her 
               husband (see snapshots)... making love in their bedroom. 
               It's an amateur longshot, and as they have finished one phase 
               of love-making, they both laugh, turn to the camera, and 
               bow... and then applaud, then bow again, turn to each other 
               and resume the love-making.

               Dad and Sid applaud vigorously.

               6. They open a fruitcake tin, unwrap the fruitcake and start 
               to eat it in big chunks.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Don and Vic are emerging from the Baggage Area. Don with his 
               one bag, and Richie tails behind with his attitude apparent.

               There's a homeless man with two children, who simply mumbles 
               "Spare change?" Vic reaches in and hands him some spare 
               change. Don doesn't really notice.

                                     DON
                         Vic, I feel like you're an old, old 
                         friend.

                         sweat it.

               They arrive at Vic's car, a new Cadillac, throw Don's suitcase 
               in the back seat, and Richie follows silently.

                         of birth.

               HIS VIEW: A squad car passes slowly in the streets, stops at 
               some neighborhood kids who are sledding, asks them something, 
               they shake their heads, and we overhear, we haven't seen 
               anyone... just people we know.

               The car goes on.

                                     SID
                         Well, nothing lasts forever.

               SID turns to Dad, now coming out of the bathroom... with his 
               pants on and trying to pull a woman's undies over his head 
               as he goes. In his mouth, he's carrying a brassier.

                                     SID
                         Well look at you.

                         No go.

               Sid helps him to take the women's undies off his head, and 
               helps him into his own shirt.

                                     SID
                         This is very becoming, but you 
                         wouldn't want me to get the wrong 
                         idea.

               He takes the brassier from Dad, looks him in the eye.

                                     SID
                         Are you getting bored, like me? Don't 
                         you think we should get out of here 
                         soon?

               Dad agrees, nods yes, definitely, yes.

                                     SID
                         But don't you think we should get 
                         caught... instead of just turning 
                         ourselves in?

               Dad isn't sure, he shakes his head, no, then maybe, then 
               nods...

                                     DAD
                         Pickles.

               Dad pulls something from his pocket. It's the fashion condom. 
               Dad grins, tries like hell to wiggle his eyebrows like Groucho 
               Marx, on the make.

                         Now, that's a good idea. Let's call 
                         "Nurse" Cooper, have her come over, 
                         have some fun...
                              (Sid winks!)
                         ...and then they can catch us, we'll 
                         say gee whiz we're really sorry, but 
                         we're too old to know any better. 
                         Here, take us away.

               Sid puts his hands out to be "cuffed." Dad mimics the action.

               Sid guffaws, and Dad guffaws with him, as Sid picks up the 
               bedside phone, punches in the number.

                                     SID
                         Now, of course, we're going to clean 
                         up your house... your family'll never 
                         know we were even here.

               INT. OLD OAKS - NURSES STATION - DAY

               A nurse is at the desk holding the phone in the air.

                                     NURSE
                         Um, Miss Cooper, telephone. It's 
                         your nephew.

               "Nurse" Cooper hurries to the phone.

                                     "NURSE" COOPER
                         My nephew... ? All the way from 
                         England?

                         why... YES! Oh, I certainly could... 
                         would... and... should.

               She hangs up, looks around furtively, then heads back to her 
               room quickly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BIG HOUSE - DAY

               Dad and Sid are raiding the utility closet, pulling out a 
               vacuum cleaner, a bucket and mop, a broom, duster, etc. Sid 
               starts to fill the pail with water, and suds are starting to 
               form.

               He sees Dad, struggling with the plug to the vacuum cleaner, -- 
               he's trying to plug it into itself.

                                     SID
                         Here, let me help with that.

               Sid plugs it into the wall, and then Dad starts to vacuum 
               with it.

                                     DAD
                         Nooooo... this... is it.

               Dad starts to vacuum in one direction... loves it...

                                     SID
                         Not that way... this way.

               He turns the direction around, and Dad fights with him for 
               control of the vacuum, but Sid wins.

                                     SID
                         This way... okay?

               Dad agrees now and starts to vacuum in that direction, so 
               Sid lets go and heads off, but see that --

               Dad lets the vacuum cleaner go and watches it zoom off through 
               the doorway into the dining room, and it's heading for...

               An huge antique art deco flower vase.

               Sid runs to catch it, and... just before it hits the Ming 
               Vase... he does. He lifts the Deco vase as the vacuum goes 
               by, and he cannot stop the vacuum in time...

               ON DAD -- delighted.

               ...when the vacuum drags a Tiffany standing lamp down and it 
               falls... slowly... teetering...

               Dad is watching it, his neck turning with every teeter.

               Sid now has the same problem, watching it teeter... and then 
               finally, fall, and Sid runs... and... slides... ...just in 
               time to catch the lamp by its shade on his chest, holds it 
               in the air triumphantly, just like a center fielder.

               Dad laughs.

               Sid is just returning the lamp to its upright position, when 
               he sees Dad's expression, puzzled.

               Sid turns to see what Dad sees, which is --

               Foaming water pouring out of the utility room, under the 
               door, and into the hall, and down the stairs... foaming and 
               flowing uncontrollably.

               Sid and Dad run to turn off the water, but of course they 
               must run through the foam to get to its source, and they 
               slip and pratfall, get up, fall, slide a few feet, get up 
               help each other, in fact hold on to each other as their legs 
               slip away and out from them in opposite directions.

               They stare into each others eyes, facing the inevitable, 
               kind of liking the experience IN SLOW MOTION, but finally...

               ...slide and pratfall on their faces. They scream with 
               delight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VIC'S CAR - DAY

               Vic's car is turning a corner as --

                                     VIC'S VOICE
                         See, the real estate business is 
                         like life. People. Family. People 
                         taking risks, people making 
                         commitments to other people, people 
                         being with people, family... whatever.

               INSIDE THE CAR --

               Vic and Don in front seat, Richie, still with a chip, in the 
               back.

                                     VIC
                         You take a few risks, you sign 'em 
                         up, hope for a sale... but when 
                         there's a sale, Don, what a high!

                                     DON
                         You love the deal.

                                     VIC
                         Don, shame on you. It's the people... 
                         with every sale there's a story... 
                         not just ONE story, but two. The 
                         seller's got a story, and the buyer's 
                         got a story. It's the process of 
                         living... right in front of my eyes, 
                         somebody has a baby, needs more room, 
                         somebody's mother-in-law moves in... 
                         the neighborhood gets old... they 
                         move... and I like the naked city, 
                         there's a story... and I'm there, 
                         part of the story... and when I can 
                         help someone... that's a high!

                                     DON
                         It's a sale.

               Don shrugs...it's hard for him to listen to Vic's patter.

                                     VIC
                         See, even now... we're looking for 
                         your Dad, who's... woooee... HE'S 
                         "looking for the Man"... I know you 
                         want to help him find the man... and 
                         me too.

               They have passed through the neighborhood, and in fact they 
               are this moment passing right by the Big house with the 
               decorations, and the kids sledding nearby.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OLD OAKS - THE PORTICO - DAY

               A taxicab pulls up outside and waits.

               INT. OLD OAKS - THE FRONT CHECK OUT DESK - DAY

               Two or three nurses are checking out for lunch.

                                     NURSE DERRICK
                         ...back after lunch.

                                     CHECK OUT NURSE
                         Ok.

               Another nurse mumbles "back after Lunch," goes, and then a 
               third approaches the desk in a very large raincoat with the 
               collar pulled up and a snow hat pulled down to her nose. You 
               can only see her eyes.

                                     "NURSE" COOPER
                         ...lunch.

                                     CHECK OUT NURSE
                         OK.

               "Nurse" Cooper heads for the front door, she can barely 
               believe it was so easy, too easy. Yep, too easy.

               As soon as she goes out behind the other two, the Check Out 
               Nurse is joined by Mrs. Oakley and they go to the window, 
               pull the curtain back --

               WHAT THEY SEE --

               "Nurse" Cooper gets in the cab and the cab goes, and --

               Mrs. Oakley and Check Out Nurse turn their heads --

               THEY SEE --

               Out of sight, Nurse Derrick and Nurse Russel get into the 
               back of a Police Car and it pulls out... following the 
               taxicab.

                                     MRS. OAKLEY
                         Well, soon enough... soon enough.

               She shares a nod with the Check Out Nurse, as --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Vic's car is driving on neighborhood streets... slowly.

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               On Vic and Don and Richie, eating McDonald's burgers, as 
               they go.

                                     VIC
                         ...so when I met Barb... in the 7th 
                         grade... you'd gone off to McKinley 
                         Junior High... I stayed at Peabody... 
                         and it was love at first sight... 
                         and it was love at last sight too... 
                         right?

               Don is getting annoyed, either by Vic or the frustration of 
               one house after another but nothing to find.

                                     DON
                         Yeah, I can see you still love her. 
                         You have a great family, Vic...

                                     VIC
                         ...there's no magic to it, just be 
                         open. You could do it, Don. Find a 
                         good woman, a REAL woman, make it 
                         easier for your son to decide to 
                         live with you.

                                     DON
                         Oh, shit, Vic... will you hang it up 
                         for a minute! I tried. You did it. 
                         You stayed home, I left for the big 
                         city. Fame and fortune. You made it 
                         on your terms, and I've made it... 
                         on... mine.

               Vic smiles, throws up his arms.

               In the back seat, Richie moves up to his father's ear in the 
               front seat.

                                     RICHIE
                         Why don't you listen to Vic? Why 
                         don't you listen to anybody!?

               Don turns his head, pretends to be cool.

                                     DON
                         I thought you weren't talking to me.

                                     RICHIE
                         Well, now, I'm talking to you, you 
                         stupid prick.

               Don looks back at him. Richie strikes out at him with the 
               hockey stick. Don grabs it.

                                     DON
                         Fine... you don't like me? Go live 
                         with your mother.

               Richie jumps out of the back door...

                                     RICHIE
                         Fine, I will. You prick.

               He's gone... slipping and sliding and the standing and running 
               away.

               Vic stops the car completely. Don jumps runs after Richie.

                                     DON
                         Richie... come back here.

               ON RICHIE

               Running... running...running... it's hard to run on the 
               street, it's slippery, so he cuts in through a snow bank ard 
               continues to huff through the snow.

                                     RICHIE
                         Just stay away from me! You dumb 
                         prick!

               ON DON

               Running... running... running... it's hard to follow the 
               younger Richie and Don's starting to huff.

                                     DON
                         Richie...!!

               Richie runs some more. Huffing, looking back after his father, 
               catching up, calling to him. Richie still had his hockey 
               stick in hand, and... whoops, he trips on the stick, stumbles 
               and falls, starts to get back up, but -- Don jumps over him, 
               holding him by the arm.

                                     RICHIE
                         Let go of me! I hate you! I hate 
                         you!

               Richie tries to hit him with the hockey stick, but Don grabs 
               it, and pushes it against Richie's chest.

                                     DON
                         Yeah, if you hate me, I must be doing 
                         a good job. Boys are supposed to 
                         hate their fathers.

               This enrages Richie, who can't move.

                                     RICHIE
                         Real fathers don't lie! You lied to 
                         me... you lied to me! Fathers don't 
                         lie... that's why you're a prick!

               ON DON

               His expression is wide-eyed and he's out of control, trembling -- 
               he makes a fist, cocks his arm back --

                                     RICHIE
                         Go ahead, you prick! Hit your own 
                         son, beat me up... just like YOUR 
                         father beat you, you prick!

               Don smashes his fist... but --

               Someone's hand catches his arm. Holds it. Holds it. Trembling. 
               Trembling.

               Don looks up.

               It's Vic, holding his arm, challenging him eye to eye, arm 
               to arm.

               Don looks into his eyes.

                                     DON
                         Who the Hell ARE you?

                                     VIC
                         I'm your best friend. Check -- I'm 
                         your only friend.

               Vic still holds Don's wrist. Still trembling, Don takes a 
               deep breath, tries to catch his breath...

               Vic finally lets go, and Don let's his trembling arm down. 
               Don, his whole body trembling now, looks at Richie.

                                     DON
                         Richie... forgive me.

               Richie doesn't forgive him, not yet. Richie pulls himself 
               out from under his father, and gets up, picks up his hockey 
               stick and starts trekking back to the car.

               Vic holds his hand out to Don, helps him up. Don brushes 
               himself off, starts to follow Richie. Vic puts his arm over 
               Don's shoulder as they go. Don just barely allows it.

               LONG SHOT, AS THEY GO --

                                     DON'S VOICE
                         Have you ever had a shock run through 
                         your whole body. Like an electric 
                         current. Like the Electric Chair. 
                         That's what happened to me. Sometimes 
                         it takes some shock, some wild moment 
                         in your life -- someone's death, or 
                         maybe you come near dying yourself 
                         somehow. Something to change your 
                         life, something to shake you up from 
                         the inside out... and you never really 
                         know when or where it's going to 
                         come from. In my case, it was my 
                         son... and my... my... best friend, 
                         Vic Hudnut, who did it for me.

               They reach Vic's car in LONG SHOT; get back into Vic's car, 
               silently, and Vic drives off down the streets again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TAXICAB - DAY

               "Nurse" Cooper is putting on lipstick, and unbuttoning the 
               top buttons of her blouse, pulling down the lapels to reveal 
               some substantial cleavage, albeit wrinkled.

               The cabdriver turns up the main thoroughfare.

                                     "NURSE"
                         How soon? How soon? Juniper Street... 
                         3-3-2.

                                     CABDRIVER
                         Streets are slippery, ma'am. We're 
                         getting there.

               He looks into his rearview mirror, and sees what he expects 
               to see. The police car behind him has turned at the same 
               corner he turned at.

               He takes a breath.

               Nurse thinks for a second, makes a decision, and unbuttons 
               even one more button, looks ahead confidently.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BIG HOUSE - DAY

               ON DAD --

               Peeking through the living room window. He gets excited.

               HIS VIEW --

               Vic's car is pulling up in front of the Big House, and Vic 
               and Don and Richie are getting out.

               Dad runs to Sid, jumping up and down like a dog who needs to 
               go out to pee, now!

                                     DAD
                         Tickets. The Ticket, She needs... 
                         too many. BLISTER!

                                     SID
                         Your son? Here...? Now? What about 
                         Nurse Cooper...?

               Sid runs to the window, looks out.

               HIS VIEW THROUGH CURTAINS

               Don and Richie and Vic walking up the walk.

                                     SID
                         Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

               EXT. THE BIG HOUSE - DAY

               Don, Richie, Vic walking up to the house, stopping to look --

                                     VIC
                         ...hard to say... I don't know why I 
                         didn't think of it... the Hansen's 
                         went to Florida Christmas Day... 
                         it's worth a try...

               They walk up further...

                                     RICHIE
                         Grampa!

               HIS VIEW

               Dad in the window, holding the curtains back, frozen there.

                                     DON
                         Dad! Dad?!

               Dad is frozen at the curtain, but Sid comes into view, looks 
               through the window, sees them coming and pulls Dad away from 
               the curtains.

               Don and Vic look at each other.

                                     VIC
                         If we break in, we're trespassing.

                                     DON
                         Maybe they'll answer the door.

               They go to the doorbell, Don rings it. Richie looks through 
               the side windows.

               HE SEES: Sid pushes Dad down the hall away from the door.

                                     RICHIE
                         They're running away.

               The three look at each other.

                                     DON
                         Vic and I'll go around back. Richie... 
                         stay here in case they come out the 
                         front door.

               They split up as:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE TAXICAB - DAY

               "Nurse" Cooper on the edge of the back seat, as the driver 
               turns... and yes it's down Juniper Street.

                                     DRIVER
                         Okay, Lady... just down the street 
                         now.

                                     "NURSE"
                         Do I look all right?

                                     DRIVER
                         If I may say it, lady, for your age...

                                     "NURSE"
                         Yes, for my age...?

                                     DRIVER
                         ...you're the sexiest fox I've ever 
                         seen. There's the house.

                                     "NURSE"
                         Oh... what an adventure.

               Nurse Cooper is excited.

               Suddenly, her eyes widen, then pop.

               HER VIEW THROUGH ADVANCING WINDSHIELD

               FULL VIEW -- the house, with Richie out front and on the 
               roof... two men climbing on to the roof from an attic's peak 
               window... then working their way around the roof to the 
               backside of the roof's peak.

                                     "NURSE'S" V.O.
                         Do YOU see what I see?

               Behind the cab, the Police Car turns on its SIRENS.

               ON DON

               looking down the street, the cab and the police car with its 
               sirens.

               He wonders what's happening, then looks up to see Dad and 
               Sid just disappearing around to the backside of the roof.

                                     SID
                         Time to go!

                                     DAD
                         Oh, boy...

               Dad holds his nose like he's jumping into a pool, and they 
               slide down the snowy slope of the roof...

               ON DON VIC AND RICHIE

               ...running around to the back of the house. Don leads the 
               way now, possessed, fearless, determined.

                                     DON
                         DAD! Where'd they go? Dad?

               ON DAD AND SID

               ...landing in a pile of snow, Dad helps Sid getup and they 
               start to run through the back yard.

               ON DON, VIC AND RICHIE

               ...running around the side of the house.

               NEW ANGLE -- THE BACK YARD

               As Don, Richie and Vic arrive where Dad and Sid just were.

               They turn this way and that, trying to figure it out. Richie 
               points at the ground.

                                     RICHIE
                         Footprints!!

                                     DON
                         Come on!

               Don leads the way, as they all start following the footprints 
               like bloodhounds, methodically... and all too slowly... as --

               ANOTHER ANGLE-FEATURING THE GARAGE OF THE HOUSE

               With the three footprint detectives in the background, they 
               don't see what we see --

               THE DOOR OF THE GARAGE OPENS AUTOMATICALLY, revealing Sid 
               just behind the door, and suddenly one of the cars in the 
               garage, The Jeep Cherokee-4WD revs its engine, starts backing 
               out without stopping and then the Jeep blasts out in reverse.

               ON DON, RICHIE AND VIC

               Their heads turn, and their eyes... POP!

               ON DON

               Amazed, terrified...

                                     DON
                         DAD! DON'T...!! DAD, STOP!!

               Don runs -- trudging through the snow... to get to the 
               driveway, too late to do anything, but just in time to watch --

               DON'S VIEW -- DOWN THE DRIVEWAY

               As the Jeep zooms out in reverse... and instead of stopping 
               or turning into the street, the Jeep runs across the street 
               and up the lawn of the house across the street, finally 
               stopping when it hits the trunk of the big oak tree, but now 
               digging a rut from the wheels reving against the force of 
               the tree.

               Don runs after -- as Vic and Richie struggle to keep pace, 
               well behind.

               NEW ANGLE -- ON THE STREET

               The cab has stopped on the street, and the cop car has 
               stopped. The cops have gotten out of the car and are starting 
               to walk up to the house, when the Jeep slips and slides 
               quickly up the lawn across the street.

               IN THE JEEP

               Dad and Sid, with Dad at the wheel, trying to shift into 
               another gear...

                                     DAD
                         BLUR! See... more! Fast!

                                     SID
                         Here. Do it! I told you. I don't 
                         drive.

               ...and Sid finally helps him, shift into first gear. Dad 
               steps on the gas... they go. The blind leading the blind.

               ON SCENE

               As the Jeep swings out, slides, and finally goes down the 
               street, nearly missing a few parked cars, and the kids who 
               were sledding disperse fast.

               The two cops jump into the squad car and take off, slipping 
               and finally sliding 180 degree turnaround to follow the Jeep.

               ON DON,

               arriving at Vic's car -- he jumps in, starts it, revs it, 
               burns rubber on the ice, slides around 180 degrees, just in 
               time to pick up Vic and Richie.

                                     DON
                         I'm driving, okay?

                                     VIC
                         It's about time.

               They jump in as the car moves off, slipping and sledding...

               ON NURSE COOPER

               Stepping out of the cab with one hand on the door, Watching 
               the events unfold, looking this way, then that way...

                                     NURSE
                         Amazing... amazing...
                              (she jumps back in 
                              the cab)
                         Follow that car. AND that one! And 
                         that one too!!

               The taxicab takes off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON SCENE --

               OVERVIEW FROM A HIGH TOR OVERLOOKING JUNIPER STREET AND 
               ENVIRONS, THEN SEGUEING AND INTERCUTTING AS NEEDED BELOW:

               Three cars, two of them following the Jeep, which is basically 
               frenetic in the directions it chooses to go. It goes up 
               Juniper Street, then turns into and through someone's 
               driveway, through the backyard, and right through a row of 
               bushes, and into the opposing house's back yard, then, 
               reversing angle, through and out their driveway onto the 
               next street, and Vic's car goes right through and the police 
               car follows and goes right through too, but not the taxicab, 
               which despite Nurse Cooper's directions goes around the block, 
               but comes out just in time to be actually ahead of the Jeep 
               as the Jeep emerges, and the Jeep slams into the back of the 
               taxicab and starts pushing it down the street, with the cab 
               driver yelling to stop, and Nurse Cooper having the time of 
               her life, waving to the drivers of the Jeep.

                                     SID
                         Look, it's Nurse Cooper.

               Dad smiles, and they wave to Nurse Cooper.

               ON SCENE

               As a fifth vehicle, the WDDD-TV "EYE WITNESS NEWSVAN" joins 
               the parade.

               The side door is open, and a videocam man hangs precariously 
               out the door, shooting the scene -- while another man holds 
               tight on to his shoulder harness.

               IN VIC'S CAR - JUST BEHIND THE JEEP

               Don is driving Vic's new Cadillac like a race driver, a white 
               knuckler.

                                     DON
                         Ok, hold on!

                                     RICHIE
                         He's turning into the park.

               THEIR VIEW -- as the Jeep turns into a rocky, hilly park. 
               The Jeep goes over one hill, and another -- and finally hits 
               a ditch, starts to rev its wheels and can't move out.

               ON SCENE

               As Don's car runs over the same embankment and falls into 
               the same ditch, spins its wheels but it's no-go.

               And after that, the police car runs into the same ditch, 
               spins its wheels and it's no-go.

               The taxicab follows. Same deal.

               The newsvan follows and dips into the same ditch. Same result. 
               The cameraman jumps out of the van with a Mini-Cam on his 
               shoulder to stay on scene, and a NEWSCASTER, STACEY, jumps 
               into the snow with a microphone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE OLD OAKS - THE TV AREA - DAY

               Most of the residents, elderly and nurses are glued to the 
               TV News event.

                                     NEWSCASTER STACEY
                         ...Jim, the two retirees, may now be 
                         trapped... in a ditch... and, let's 
                         just hope they can be rescued without 
                         incident.

                                     OLD OAKS RESIDENTS
                         Boo! Boo!

               The Old Oaks residents, even the nurses, are on the edge of 
               their seats.

               ON TV SET: TV NEWS VIEW

               While the Jeep spins its wheels, the police, Nurse Cooper, 
               and the Newscaster with the Mic are seen trudging through 
               the snow... from the ditch where their vehicles got stuck.

               BACK ON SCENE

               INT. THE JEEP

               Dad is accelerating wildly. Sid looks at the gear box.

               Sees: CLOSE: GEARBOX LEVERS, One level reads: "4WD"

               Sid pushes the lever and --

               ON SCENE

               The Jeep's wheels grab the ground and it grumbles out of the 
               ditch.

               INT. THE OLD OAKS - DAY

               The residents cheer wildly.

               ON SCENE

               Don and Richie and Vic watch the Jeep go over a ridge and 
               they groan -- Don hits the wheel with the palms of his hands.

                                     DON
                         Damn!

               He revs it hard, again and again, but it's no go.

               ON SCENE

               The cops and the newsmen and Nurse Cooper... each forty feet 
               from the other, and groaning and turning nearly in unison, 
               and trudging through the snow in that direction.

               INT. THE JEEP

               Rough and tumble, slip and slide... Dad and Sid.

                                     SID
                         ...turn it that way. That way!

                                     DAD
                         I do my own...! ...find the man!

                                     SID
                         The Man you wanna find and The Man I 
                         wanna find are two different guys. 
                         You are gonna get us killed.

               Dad looks at him with a Who-Cares grin... and turns it the 
               other way. They start to struggle for control of the wheel.

               ON DON IN VIC'S CAR Reving it, again and again. Turning the 
               wheel, and then... suddenly the wheels catch a tree's root... 
               and --

               ON THE CAR

               As it shoots out of the ditch, and they spin out and away.

               ON THE JEEP

               Slipping and sliding and rolling over a ridge, nearly tipping 
               over, then righting itself, and going strong --

               ON SID

               -- his eyes popping at his view ahead. He holds on for dear 
               life.

               HIS VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- They are heading for a 
               cliff.

               EXT. THE JEEP IN THE SNOW - DAY

               Heading for disaster... as the Jeep sails right up and over 
               the cliff --

               ON THE CLEAR BLUE SKY AS -- IN TANTALIZING SLOW MOTION

               The Jeep sails effortlessly through the blue.

               ON FACES -- DON AND RICHIE

               As Don drives towards the cliff... craning necks to follow, 
               then quickly chins drop and eyes turn down as --

               ON JEEP

               In the blue sky in faltering slomo, then it plummets to earth 
               and plows head first into a snow bank in the gulley below.

               ON VIC'S CADILLAC

               flying through the snow towards the cliff, and just in time.

               DON

               turns the wheel hard, and -- 

               THE CADILLAC

               turns, slides around and around, and then stops... right at 
               the edge of the cliff... miraculously. Don jumps out and 
               runs to the edge of the cliff. Richie and Vic follow.

               THEIR VIEW FROM ABOVE

               The Jeep is buried head first in the snowbank, it's door 
               flung open, and on one side Dad's lifeless body is strewn on 
               the snow next to the Jeep.

               ON DON

               Terror on his face.

                                     DON
                         DAD!!

               Don leaps off the cliff without a second of hesitation.

                                     RICHIE
                         DAD!!

               Richie runs to the cliff side. Looks down, as does everyone -- 
               they've all finally caught up.

               THEIR VIEW OF THE SCENE IN THE GULCH BELOW -- INTERCUTTING 
               WITH VIEW ABOVE GULCH

               Don has fallen in the snow face first, motionless for a split 
               second, GASPS HEARD from above, then he moves, looks to Dad's 
               body... and rolls over to it. He looks into Dad's dead face... 
               starts to weep...

                                     DON
                         Dad? -- Dad!

               Suddenly, Dad opens his eyes, looks at Don... grins --

                                     DAD
                         You!

               He throws snow in Don's face.

                                     DON
                         Dad -- my God. You scared the crap 
                         out of me.

               And Don throws some snow back in Dad's face. They both grin.

                                     DON
                         Richie... he's okay.

               ON RICHIE AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF

               looking down, tears in his eyes. And before Vic can stop 
               him, Richie leaps... over the edge of the cliff.

               ON SCENE BELOW

               As Richie falls on the other side of his father, and he throws 
               snow in Dad's face too. The three of them in a snow fight.

                                     DAD
                         Ticket... you got the ticket?

                                     DON
                              (with tears of joy)
                         Yes, Dad... yeah, I got the ticket. 
                         And I found The Man, too. I did, 
                         Dad. I found the goddamn Man.

               Don, trying to throw snow, but he can't. He's laughing (or 
               is that crying) so hard he can't move. Richie puts his arm 
               around him, and Dad, laughing hysterically, jumps on them 
               both...

               QUICK INT. OLD OAKS - DAY

               The residents watching TV... cheer!

               BACK ON THE OTHERS AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF

               Nurse Cooper wiping a tear from her eye.

               Vic nods and nods and nods as his joyous grin widens.

               ON SID IN THE SHOTGUN SEAT OF THE JEEP

               Motionless. Then, he falls over... dead.

               OUR VIEW BEGINS TO PULL BACK -- PULLING BACK AND BACK AND 
               BACK

               EXT. DULUTH, MN PARK - DAY

               HELICOPTER SHOT

               As the drama's participants start to disperse... the VIEW 
               PULLS BACK AND BACK AND BACK...

                                     DON'S VOICE
                         Dad, I think, had finally found the 
                         man. And I knew that I had found the 
                         man too... I still didn't know exactly 
                         what it meant, but I understood that 
                         Dad knew what it meant, and it was 
                         better not to try to describe it... 
                         you know... describe it... he just 
                         KNEW. And now, I just KNEW. And I 
                         think, maybe, Richie just KNEW too... 
                         and, goddamn, what a wonderful thing 
                         it is to find The Man. You know, the 
                         one inside yourself.

               As OUR VIEW PULLS BACK, the entire city of Duluth is revealed 
               below... and the heavy drone of a Jetliner becomes 
               overwhelming, mixing with the sound of DON'S VOICE, and --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. 747 AIRPLANE - DAY

               Don is looking through the window at the scene below... the 
               City of Duluth receding into the distance, and PULLING BACK...

                                     DON'S VOICE
                         I finally got a window seat...

               ...his place at the window now REVEALED, AND PULLING BACK 
               MORE, DAD is sitting next to him, fast asleep, and the aisle 
               just across from Dad, Richie is playing a video game with 
               Don's laptop computer, looking over to check on Grampa every 
               once in a while.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         It wasn't going to be easy. They say 
                         that the things that are worthwhile 
                         in life are never easy... you have 
                         to work at it... at least you do in 
                         this day and age.

               Dad opens one eye, then the other, looks over at the dozing 
               Don, then the other way, sees Richie, winks, then looks at 
               Don again and grins. Reaches out for Don's hand. Don blinks 
               awake as Dad slams his palm against Don's palm, then takes 
               his hand away, like a magician... and leaving an object in 
               Don's palm.

               It's the Fashion Condom.

               Don looks in his palm, and grins. Dad grins knowingly. Richie 
               looks at it, turns his head.

                                     DAD
                         Busy. Busy.

               He starts to get up. Struggles with his seat belt.

                                     DON
                         No Dad! You can't get up. Please.

               Richie leans in.

                                     RICHIE
                         Dad... Grampa needs to go to the 
                         bathroom.

                                     DON
                         Oh.

                                     RICHIE
                         Don't worry, I'll watch him.

               Richie helps Dad out of his seat belt, and they head up the 
               aisle.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         If I learned anything about My Dad 
                         as an Old Timer's patient it was 
                         that more often than not, there was 
                         a method to his madness... so I have 
                         a hunch he knew how important he is, 
                         how important it was for him to serve 
                         as the missing link...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The lavatory door, reading "Occupied", and a line of people 
               waiting outside. Richie looks at his watch, and smiles 
               sheepishly at the next person in line.

               Richie knocks on the door. A Stewardess now comes forward 
               and knocks on the door with a crowbar. And just as she's 
               about to force the door open, the "Occupied" sign turns to 
               "Vacant" and Dad emerges with shaving cream all over his 
               face and head and hands, and no razor to be seen. He didn't 
               need a shave anyway.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         ...not just the missing link between 
                         my old home and my new home, but 
                         between the generations... the link 
                         to my own son.

               Richie leads Dad back to his seat, helps him sit down, and 
               then straps his seat belt for him. Don and Richie exchange a 
               little knowing grin.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I think maybe Richie felt that too. 
                         He understood how important my Dad 
                         was to him, too.

               ON DON

               Don shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath. Sunlight streams 
               in through the window over his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE AIRLINE BUILDING - PORTLAND AIRPORT - DAY

               Dad and Richie and Don riding a walking sidewalk. Dad feels 
               funny about it, so he sort of dances to keep his feet off 
               the ground as much as he can.

               Richie is holding an airline carton marked "Fragile, Living 
               Animals", with little holes and the sound of Parakeets 
               chirping inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE AIRLINE TERMINAL - OUTSIDE THE BAGGAGE AREA - DAY

               Dad and Richie and Don emerge with their baggage. Formerly 
               Santa Claus, now the same guy has a sign, "Homeless... will 
               work for food" guy is outside the door, and this time, Don 
               gives him some money, returns the homeless man's nod.

               Dad starts to cross the street, and they catch him just as 
               he's about to be hit by a Tram from the Portland Sheraton 
               Hotel.

               And as the tram passes, an old pickup truck is revealed 
               pulling up to the curb.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         It was New Year's Eve day, and... 
                         surprise... I had made a New Year's 
                         date... with, guess who, Jan Patrick.

               Jan leans over Bren to open the shotgun door and waves. Don 
               doesn't see her, not until Max, the dog, barks from the back 
               of the truck... and Don waves back, moves with Dad and Richie 
               to the truck. The truck also has some young potted evergreen 
               trees in the truck bed.

               Max is barking and shaking and jumping with joy at seeing 
               Dad, and Dad feels the same way, and just climbs in the 
               truckbed with him, and Richie follows.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         We left Bren and Richie to baby-sit 
                         Dad and the birds and Max, who was 
                         so happy when he saw Dad that he 
                         just went nuts. Dogs know. Dogs 
                         experience what every human wants to 
                         experience, unconditional love.

               The truck pulls out into traffic, as --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. A SMALL FARMHOUSE WITH A SIGN IN FRONT

                    "JAN PATRICK NURSERY - We have anything you need."

               As the truck pulls up in front, and Jan lets everyone off... 
               except for Don. Then it drives off again.

               ON DON AND JAN.

               ON A MOUNTAIN CREST

               She smiles and he smiles back.

                                     DON'S VOICE
                         Can you believe it, we never said 
                         one word to each other that whole 
                         magical New Year's Eve night. Jan 
                         and I were experiencing something... 
                         unconditional.

               Don and Jan in the truckbed having dinner, wrapped in a big 
               Hudson Bay blanket. Mount Hood is in the distance as the sun 
               sets behind it.

               They toast each other, clinking champagne glasses. Don's 
               Voice never has sounded so mellow, easy, right.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         We drank champagne, waited patiently 
                         'till midnite, drank more champagne.

               TIME PASSING --

               Don and Jan sitting up, wrapped together cozily in the 
               blanket, until the SOUND OF SOME NEW YEAR'S REVELERS' yelling 
               Happy New Year from a passing car.

               TIME PASSING AGAIN --

               Jan and Don come together and exchange their first kiss, and 
               they like it so much that they do it again... and again.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         So, we kissed and kissed and kissed 
                         and then we screwed our brains out. 
                         Nobody makes love on the first date 
                         anymore, but it just seemed right... 
                         not only did we practice safe sex... 
                         but we used the fashion condom Nurse 
                         Cooper had given Dad, and he had 
                         given me. That seemed just right. 
                         Then we slept in the back of the 
                         truck 'till dawn.

               OUR VIEW has delicately MOVED AWAY to the STARLIT NIGHT and 
               then, as the Sun Rises over Mount Hood, OUR VIEW returns to 
               the sleepers, molded together, under the blankets in the 
               open truckbed.

                                            A VERY, VERY, LONG DISSOLVE TO:

               A beautiful sunny day... mountains in the distance... birds 
               chirping...

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         I must have been doing something 
                         right... All my New Year's wishes 
                         came true. Jan and I were married. I 
                         sold my condo, and that paid off the 
                         mortgage on Jan's little farm. We 
                         grew things... and made a living at 
                         it.

               Don loads some little seedlings onto the back of the truck. 
               Richie's mother called me that very day, New Year's, and 
               told me she'd gotten married in Hawaii...

               INT. THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

               CLOSE ON JAN

               Cleaning up the kitchen table, a gallery of family photos on 
               the wall behind her. Many of the photos are from the old 
               gallery wall in the kitchen at Dad's house. But, just as 
               many or more are new, and many of them have Don in the 
               snapshots, with Jan, with Richie, playing with Max, with 
               Dad, with Bren. And, finally, a big one of Sid, in front of 
               the Christmas tree at the big house, smiling in heaven.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Wasn't it, she said, really unfair 
                         to put so much pressure on Richie to 
                         decide which parent he should live 
                         with... and wasn't it time that a 
                         son Richie's age lived with his father 
                         and visited his mother once in a 
                         while?

               Jan moves to the kitchen window, her back to us, revealing 
               in the FOREGROUND that the kitchen table she was wiping is 
               the dinette set from Dad's house, and, yes, MOM'S CHAIR is 
               set at the old Mom's Chair angle.

               Jan watching through the window as --

               HER VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW --

               Richie comes along to help... and approaches Bren, then pulls 
               a squirt gun out from behind his back and squirts her... she 
               pushes him, then runs... and he chases her.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Like what's her name -- Dorothy in 
                         the Wizard of Oz, I'd learned so 
                         much from the most surprising 
                         places... from My Dad, who couldn't 
                         think straight, from my son, who I 
                         thought was supposed to learn about 
                         life from me, and from Vic Hudnut in 
                         my hometown, the best friend I didn't 
                         even know I had... 'til he saved my 
                         life... and from Jan, who came from 
                         Heaven to share her love with mine.

               STILL ON JAN LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW

               -- as Don catches her glance and throws her a kiss. Jan grins, 
               sighs...

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Turned out Jan was not a divorced 
                         woman... she was a widow. Her husband 
                         caught a cold one day and just up 
                         and died of Pneumonia. Shit happens. 
                         Life is a bitch, and then you die. I 
                         don't like that saying. Uh-uh. Life 
                         is precious, live it! That's what I 
                         say, that's what My Dad does every 
                         day.

               EXT. OUTDOORS - DAY

               ON DAD -- OUTDOORS

               Dad is throwing bird seed to the winds, and a hundred birds 
               fly in and out of nowhere and start pecking at the ground.

                                     DON'S V.O.
                         Dad, well, you know My Dad, the 
                         missing link... the man with a method 
                         to his madness. He'd found the man 
                         just like I had -- but it takes a 
                         woman too. So, Jan and I figured Dad 
                         ought to have a full time, around 
                         the clock nurse...

               REVEALING --

               Nurse Cooper breezes into frame, dressed like a real nurse, 
               frilled head crown and all, -- joins Dad, crushing her ample 
               bosom into his ribs.

                                     NURSE COOPER
                         Almost time for our nap, Lester.

               Dad's eyes widen, as her hand moves down to his butt.

                                     DON'S VOICE
                         And it just seemed our family was 
                         destined to grow...

               The homeless guy from Portland Airport comes out of a shed 
               with a bushel of tomatoes, asks where he should put them, 
               and Don points to the spot.

                                     DON'S VOICE
                         ...and grow... again.

               Jan walks into frame, her belly heavy with child. She stands 
               with Don and squints as they look to the horizon.

                                     DON'S VOICE
                         Times have changed, it's harder to 
                         find the man, and all this love stuff 
                         must sound really corny now, but, 
                         you know what, I'll put all my money 
                         on corn any day of the week. There's 
                         still a good life out there, you can 
                         still look life right in the face, 
                         and demand that good life and grab 
                         it while there's still time. If you 
                         haven't found the man yet, I know 
                         you can, and I know you will.

               MOVING OVER DON AND JAN'S SHOULDERS TO THE HORIZON, the 
               beautiful mountains, blue sky, and white clouds.

               MUSIC, OUR THEME IS UP, AND AWAY.

                                         THE END
