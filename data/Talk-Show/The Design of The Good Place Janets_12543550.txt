COLD OPEN

INT. JANET’S VOID - INDETERMINATE TIME (D1) 1001

 

AN INFINITE WHITE SPACE. Then: MICHAEL and JANET POP INTO
IT! Michael takes it in -- relieved, giddy, out of breath.

MICHAEL
Janet... you did it! You brought us into
your void! Wow. If I had a heart it
would be pounding!

JANET
Michael...?

MICHAEL
You'd think there’d be some side effects,
but I feel fine! How’s my hair? still
amazing?

JANET
There may have been a couple of side
effects for the humans.

Michael looks over --

MICHAEL
...Huh.

REVEAL: ELEANOR, CHIDI, TAHANI and JASON... all look like
FOUR IDENTICAL JANETS.

Michael, at a loss, just stares.

ELEANOR-JANET
Dude. Why are there so many Janets? And
why do I sound like Janet?

CHIDI-JANET
You also look like Janet. Do I? Why?!
What? What is happening?

 

TAHANI-JANET
(realizing, terrified)
Oh no. Am I... wearing a vest?!
Michael, help me!

MICHAEL
This is gonna be tricky. How are we even
going to tell them apart?!

One of the Janets is playing with (or pointing to) her own boobs.

ACT ONE

INT. JANET’S VOID - MOMENTS LATER (D1)

 

Janet (the actual one) approaches Michael.

JANET
I can’t put the humans back in their own
bodies, so I’ve done the next best -- but

still not that great -- thing!

(T)

1002

REVEAL: they’re still Janet, but are now dressed in their own

outfits. Tahani-Janet checks out her dress, unimpressed.

TAHANI-JANET
I suppose this outfit will do.

ELEANOR-JANET
(sarcastic)
Are you sure? I mean, wearing a floral
print to an infinite void, at this time

of the nothing?!

CHIDI-JANET
So, where are we, exactly? We’re not on
Earth, right?

JANET
That’s correct, Chidi-Janet, you're not.
Your real bodies dematerialized when you
entered my void, and your essences
reconstituted themselves in this form.

CHIDI-JANET
Cool, cool. And when you say “void”...?

JANET
I mean a subdimension outside of space
and time, at the nexus of consciousness
and matter, tethered to my essence. Does
that help?

CHIDI-JANET
It does not help. Makes it way worse. I
just wanna lie down.
(freaking out)
Where is down?!

Reveal Jason-Janet is UPSIDE-DOWN, above them.

JASON-JANET
I found it! It’s up here.

JANET
Here you go:

She BLOOPS in a LIVING ROOM SET. Chidi-Janet lies down.

MICHAEL
Okay: Janet's void has a back door to the
Janet Warehouse in the Neutral Zone, which
is right near Accounting. You four will
stay here while Actual Janet and I sneak
through it and find the Head Accountant.

TAHANI-JANET
Why can’t we go with you?

JANET
The void is the only place you’re safe.
You just “died,” which means you’re the
first humans in history to not immediately
go to the Good or Bad Place, which in turn
makes you interdimensional fugitives.

MICHAEL
Also the Judge is probably still pissed
at me, for, you know, breaking all the
rules, and she might take it out on you.
Plus the Bad Place is probably hunting
for us. So, literally the entire
universe is against you.

ELEANOR-JANET
.-.--Okay, but what’s a fourth really good
reason?
(off everyone's silence)
Just trying to lighten the mood. Jeez.
Tough void.

MICHAEL

Janet and I will pose as Good Place
employees, and sweet-talk the Accountant
into showing us his books. If I’m right,
we'll find proof that the Bad Place is
tampering with the points system. The
Accountant will tell us what to do, and
this will all be over.

(reassuring)
We're almost at the end, guys. Just stay
here and keep Janets’ heads on straight.

JANET
But if they do fall off, you can just
screw them right back on. You just sort
of push down and turn. You'll hear a
“click.” Okay bye!

Michael and Janet disappear.

INT. ACCOUNTANT’S OFFICE - RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER (D1) 1003

 

Michael and Janet are waiting in a reception area. A NEUTRAL
JANET is there behind a desk. She has a thousand-yard stare.

MICHAEL
(aside, to Janet)
Is that a Good Janet or Bad Janet?

JANET
It’s Neutral Janet. She’s kind of the
Black Sheep of the Janet world. Or, the
blank sheep, I guess.
(excited)
Ooh, I can throw shade now! That’s cool!

They approach her.

NEUTRAL JANET
You have arrived at the accounting
office. All point calculations for
actions taken on Earth are made here.
End of conversation.

MICHAEL
My name is Michael. I need to speak with
the Head Accountant, on official Good
Place business.

NEUTRAL JANET
I will inform the head accountant of your
presence, and he either will or will not
see you in a certain amount of time, end
of conversation.

Michael notices a poster on the wall of Eleanor, Chidi,
Tahani, and Jason. It says “Wanted for Processing.”

MICHAEL
(aside)
Good thing your “void” plan worked out,
huh?

Janet tries to answer, but lets out a very long burp. As it
continues, it begins to sound auto-tuned.

JANET
Burrrrrrrrrrrrrr-eeeeeeeeeeeececeee-—ieve
in life after love?

Janet covers her mouth, embarrassed.

JANET (CONT'D)
Having four humans in my void is weird!

1004 INT. JANET'S VOID - A LITTLE LATER (D1) 1004
Chidi-Janet is pacing, continuing to freak out.

CHIDI-JANET
This is nuts. We’re in a void, in the
body of a white lady --

ELEANOR-JANET TAHANI-JANET
Not a lady. Not a lady, darling.

JASON-JANET
But we are white! Let’s all say white
things:
(just announcing things)
“Billy Joel!” “Mild salsa, please!”
“There was nowhere to park!" “Did you
refill the Brita?”

 

TAHANI-JANET
I find this void quite calming, actually.
It’s like: this time, the Xanax took me.

CHIDI-JANET
I have the worst stomachache. Sorry --
(sarcastic hand quotes)
-- "I" “have” a “stomach” “ache???”

ELEANOR-JANET
Dude, relax. Here... let's see if I can
figure this out...

BLOOP! ELEANOR-JANET creates a cute PUPPY.

CHIDI-JANET
(delighted)
Oh, wow. Eleanor, how’d you do that?

ELEANOR-JANET
(shrugs)
I dunno. We’re Janet now. That’s what
Janet does.

ACTUAL JANET pops in.

JANET
What just happened?! What did you do?!
ELEANOR-JANET
Sorry! I was just trying to help Chidi
calm down by conjuring up --

JANET

(noticing, cute voice)
Awww, puppy! Cuuuute!

(then, serious)
But: the structural integrity of this
void is already at risk, you can’t start
randomly conjuring up objects.

(cute voice; petting puppy)
Because it might shatter the void! Yes
it might! It might blow up everything
and we’ll all disappear forever!

(serious voice)

So stop it.
Janet disappears --
1005 INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE - RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS (D1) 1005
-- and pops back into the Accountant's office.

MICHAEL
Everything okay?

JANET
Nope!

NEUTRAL JANET
The Head Accountant has decided to see
you, this will happen now, end of

 

conversation.
1006 INT. ACCOUNTANT’S OFFICE - BULLPEN (D1) 1006
The Head Accountant, NEIL, approaches -- a congenial fellow

who just goddamn loves being an accountant. He’s sipping
from a mug that says Existence’s Best Boss.

 

NEIL

Hey-oh! There they are! So sorry to
keep you waiting. I’m Neil, the Head
Accountant. You must be Michael and
Janet -- I really depreciate you coming.

(chuckles)
Just a little accounting humor. What can
I do for you?

MICHAEL
Well, it’s sort of a long story. But I’m
concerned about certain... anomalies, in

the points system. I’m worried that
somehow, the Bad Place has been tampering.

NEIL
Tampering? No no no. Quite impossible.
Laughable, really. Janet -- remind me to
laugh about that later?

NEUTRAL JANET
Your amusement has been scheduled, end of
conversation.

NEIL
(rolling his eyes)
She’s a lot of fun.

MICHAEL
Could you just humor us? Show us how the
system works?

NEIL
Ehhhhhhhhhh... I suppose I can give you a
quick tour. We don’t get many visitors.
Follow me.

NEIL (CONT'D)
Love your suit, by the way. Sharp.

MICHAEL
Oh... and I like your tie.

NEIL
Thank you! It’s impossible to remove.

1007 INT. JANET'S VOID - LATER (D1 1007

Chidi-Janet and Eleanor-Janet.

CHIDI-JANET
How'd you know I always wanted a dog like
this?

ELEANOR-JANET
Funny story: it’s one of the things I saw
in the alternate timeline where we were
soulmates on and off for 300 years.
(beat)
Maybe... we should talk about that?

CHIDI-JANET
Well, I suppose we can, but there’s not
that much to talk about. The things you
saw weren’t part of my life, so they
didn’t happen to me.

ELEANOR-JANET
.-.The hell are you talking about, man?
Of course it was you. I saw it.

CHIDI-JANET

Well, it was a Chidi, sure, but it wasn’t

(points to himself)
me Chidi. This is a classic
philosophical question: the concept of
“the self,” or “who we are.” Philo-
sophically speaking, there’s the Chidi I
am, who lived a certain life, and there’s

the Chidi you saw -- your soulmate, or
whatever -- who had some entirely

different life. Not the same Chidis.

ELEANOR-JANET
Ohhhhh. Okay. Cool. Counterpoint:
that’s the dumbest thing you've ever
said, and you do not deserve a puppy
right now! I’m un-blooping your puppy!

She tries to un-bloop the puppy -- but accidentally keeps
blooping MORE AND MORE PUPPIES into existence.

ELEANOR-JANET (CONT'D)
Gah! This is getting cuter and I want it
to get less cute!

ACT TWO
INT. ACCOUNTANT’S OFFICE - BULLPEN - LATER (D1) 1008

Michael and Janet follow Neil past other ACCOUNTANTS, working
at desks. Janet looks a little out of it.

NEIL
Morning Greg! Hey there, Kioko -- TGI-7,
am I right?

Neil stops at a huge monitor with constantly scrolling text.

NEIL (CONT'D)

So! This is the main feed. Every single
action, by every single human on Earth,
is recorded, and sent here to be assigned
a point value based on the absolute moral
worth of that action. I shouldn’t really
let you see this, but what the heck --
one little example won’t hurt.

(re: screen)
A couple in Osaka, Japan just decided to
have a destination wedding. That's
negative 1200 points.

(checks )
Oh dear. It’s a destination theme
wedding. Negative four thousand three
hundred--

(checks again)
The theme is Lord of the Rings. They’re
basically doomed.

 

An ALERT sounds. The monitor flashes “UNDEFINED ACTION.”

NEIL (CONT'D)
Ooh, this is fun! A human has just done
something no one has ever done before!

MICHAEL
(reading)
Richard Moore, of Sugarland Texas,
hollowed out an eggplant, and filled it
with hot sauce and nickels.

NEIL
How about that -- it wasn’t a weird sex
thing! Ninety-nine percent of all new
human behaviors are weird sex things.
(checks again)
Oop, nevermind, actually it was a weird
sex thing. So! Now: we zip it over to
the relevant specialists for valuation.

NEIL (CONT'D)
In this case, Anastasia in the Stuffed
Vegetable Department, Hector over in
American Coins, and my buddy Matt, in
Weird Sex Things.

He gestures to the accountants. MATT looks traumatized, like
he hasn't slept in years.

MATT
(twitchy)
I’m still waiting for a response to the
latest request I filed, for immediate
suicide?

NEIL
Request denied.
(to Michael)
I love Matt! He’s hilarious.

Matt deflates. He and Anastasia begin typing furiously.

MICHAEL
So, they now examine the action -- its
use of resources, the intentions behind
it, its effects on others...

NEIL
Correct, and they arrive at this:

Below the monitor, a printer prints out the results:
ACTION NUMBER 6&7GGp*W4*41211E146 = -9.884 POINTS

NEIL (CONT'D)
And here’s why tampering is impossible.
The result is then double-checked by
three billion other accountants --
selected at random -- and if they all
come to the same conclusion, which they
always do:

ON SCREEN: A green check pops up -- MATCH.

NEIL (CONT'D)
-- it becomes official. Anyone who does
this exact thing in this exact way will
lose this many points.

The screen DINGS.

Someone else just did it?! How is that
possible?

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM/NEIL’S OFFICE - LATER (D1) 1009

Neil crosses to a controller with LARGE BUTTONS, one green,
one red. On either side are huge TUBES, one green, one red.

NEIL
When people die, their biographical
history and final point totals are sent
to the relevant destination. That batch
is headed for the Bad Place --

A WOMAN puts a sack of files under the RED TUBE and hits a
BUTTON -- it flies up and out.

NEIL (CONT'D)
-- they get the files, process the
people, then it’s either “Yayy!” Or
(mock horrified)
“Gahh gimme my penis back!”, and Bob’s
your uncle. It’s a flawless system, and
tampering is quite impossible.

MICHAEL
I see. Could we look at one specific
file, though, just to make sure?

NEIL
(intrigued)
Mmm. All right. Who do you wanna see?
Genghis Khan? Marie Antoinette? Walt
Disney has some weird stuff in his file...

MICHAEL
Doug Forcett.

Neil smiles.

1010 INT. JANET’S VOID - A LITTLE LATER (D1) 1010

Eleanor-Janet turns to Chidi-Janet as Tahani-Janet and Jason-
Janet look on.

ELEANOR-JANET
I don’t get this, man. Why wouldn’t you
want to know what our life was like?
You're not even a little curious what it
was like to hit --

-- this?

ELEANOR-JANET (CONT'D)
(realizing, annoyed)
I don’t mean “this this.” Although,
frankly, I would also hit this this.

 

CHIDI-JANET
I don’t want to see those memories
because, philosophically speaking,
they’re none of my business. They
happened to someone else. Let me
explain.

Chidi-Janet conjures three desk-chairs and a pre-written
blackboard.

ELEANOR-JANET
We can conjure any object in the
universe, and you chose a blackboard.

JASON-JANET
As long as you’re conjuring stuff, can I
have a magical rocket ship with laser

cannons?
(then, revelation)
Oooh, no, wait -- gum!

Eleanor-Janet BLOOPS some Big League Chew and hands it to
him. He tosses it in his mouth.

CHIDI-JANET
Conceptions of the Self! Let’s start
with John Locke, who believed that
personal identity was based on having a
continued consciousness -- essentially:
memory. Memories are links in a chain
that together form a single self. If I
can’t remember what happened, because it
happened to a Chidi from another
timeline, it’s not a unified “me.”

JASON-JANET
Just because you don’t remember doing
something doesn’t mean you didn’t do it.
I have no idea how it happened, but there
is definitely a tattoo on my butt that
says “Jasom.”

CHIDI-JANET
That leads us to Derek Parfit.

TAHANI-JANET
It does?

CHIDI-JANET

Parfit said: even if I have memories from
an earlier time, that doesn't necessarily
mean it was “me.” After all, if my brain
was split in two and each half was put
into a different person, which one is
“me?” All I know is, that other Chidi
doesn’t exist anymore, and

(points to herself)
this one does, so this must be the real
Chidi.

ELEANOR-JANET
And all I know is, you’re just barfing
Wikipedia all over everyone to avoid
talking about your feelings.

CHIDI-JANET

-..-Let’s talk about David Hume!

1011 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM/NEIL’S OFFICE - SAME TIME (D1) 1011

 

Michael, Janet, Neil. Neil goes to the bookshelf and pulls
out The Book of Dougs.

NEIL
Here we are -- the Book of Dougs.
(flipping pages)
Forbush... Forcap... Forcearch... Doug L.

Forcett!

He waves his hand and a SCREEN pops up. Michael tries to
peek at the screen--

NEIL (CONT'D)
Ah ah -- no peeking. Accountants only.

MICHAEL
Can you just tell me his total?

NEIL
Looks like he’s at... 520,000 points.
Well done, Doug.

MICHAEL
---So that’s good?

NEIL
It’s excellent!

He once found a dollar on the ground and
sent it to the Canadian government to
help pay down their national debt -- and
he’s not even close to getting in?! How
can that be?

NEIL
(shrugs)
Look, mate, the points are indisputable.
They have been, ever since the very
beginning.

He points to a PAINTING of a caveman handing another caveman a
rock. Plaque reads: Og Gives His Rock To Grog. 201,993 B.C.E.

MICHAEL
(nodding)
“Og gives his rock to Grog.”

NEIL
The very first altruistic human decision.
Og earned ten thousand points that day.
(beat)
Then Grog used the rock to bash Og’s head
in, and he lost a million.

We see another painting: the second caveman bashing the first

caveman’s

head in.

NEIL (CONT'D)
Point is, the math is cold, objective,
and airtight. And unless you have some
other proof that says otherwise, I don’t
know how I can help you.

Matt pops in holding FILES.

MATT

I just got seven hundred new “Weird Sex

Thing” files in the last one second.

So, in essence, Hume thought that we
don't truly have a “self,” we are just a
bundle of our ever-changing impressions --

ELEANOR-JANET

Just admit it, man -- you’re embarrassed
that you fell in love with an Arizona
trashbag.

CHIDI-JANET
Eleanor, it’s not personal. Someone fell
in love with you, it just wasn’t “me.”

Eleanor-Janet looks hurt. Janet appears, furious --

JANET
I told you not to conjure anything!

CHIDI-JANET
Sorry, I just swapped the living room for
a classroom --

JANET
No, not you -- him! Jason! What is
wrong with you?!

Jason-Janet is sitting in an EMPTY HOT TUB with PILLBOI.

JASON-JANET
Sorry, Janet! I didn’t mean to conjure
Pillboi -- I was just thinking about how
much fun we used to have hanging out in
his broken hot tub, and he showed up!

PILLBOIL
Yeah, I was just chillin’, being nothing?
And then all of a sudden: I was!

JANET
Goodbye, Pillboi.

Okay, here’s a question: if Doug
Forcett’s not getting in, who is? Let’s
look at one more file -- someone who got
into the Good Place this year.

Neil slides over to a COMPUTER and TYPES...

NEIL
Okay. Why don’t we look at...

No one. No one got in.

MICHAEL

NEIL
Correct.

How about the last three years?

Okay... doo doo doo... ah, here we go: no

Yo homie -- you and Eleanor were fighting
before, and I couldn’t help but overhear.

Hey: if we hear with our ears, why’s it
called “butt overhearing?”

Chidi-Janet stays quiet.

JASON-JANET (CONT’D)
Bro, if you don’t like her, you should
just tell her.

CHIDI-JANET
It’s not about whether I “like” Eleanor.
I got into philosophy so I could make
sense of a world that almost never makes

sense... and that was before I learned I
died, and then un-died and then re-
died... I just can’t take one more thing

right now. It’s too much.

JASON-JANET
I’m gonna tell you a story. Back in
Jacksonville, there was a guy in my 80-
person dance crew named Stank Toby --

Hang on. It was a 60-person dance crew.

Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor. I’m Arizona
shrimp horny!

ELEANOR-JANET (JASON CLOTHES)
That’s not what I sound like, Jason! Get
out of here!

Jason-Janet exits. Eleanor-Janet BLOOPS her own clothes
back, and rubs her face, fed-up.

ELEANOR-JANET (CONT'D)
Look, you know what?! Just forget it!
What am I even doing? I'm chasing a dude
who isn't into me, I’m making myself
vulnerable for no reason -- I don't even
know_who I am anymore!

Chidi-Janet looks at Eleanor-Janet, concerned --

CHIDI-JANET
-..-Uh oh. This is new.

REVEAL: Eleanor-Janet has changed into a DIFFERENT PERSON.
RANDOM PERSON 1
I’m so annoyed at myself! Gahhhh!
Stupid Eleanor!
off Chidi-Janet, stunned...

ACT THREE

INT. JANET’S VOID - SOMEWHERE - SAME TIME (D1) 1015

 

Tahani-Janet and Jason-Janet walk through a different part of
the void.

JASON-JANET
I know I asked you this before, but --

TAHANI-JANET
No, darling. This is not “where the Mac
and PC guys live.”
They happen upon a giant screen hanging in the void.
JASON-JANET
Whoa! Check out this dope flat-screen,

it’s air-mounted! You see this, Tahani?

The screen JUMPS to life -- a profile appears, with pictures
of Tahani and a list of everything that ever happened to her.

TAHANI-JANET

Oh my goodness... this must be where
Janet keeps all her information.
(realizing)

This screen can literally show us
anything that has ever happened --

JASON-JANET
(to the screen)
Cartoons. Cartoons. I think it’s
broken. “TV: play cartoons for Jason!”

TAHANI-JANET
Can't believe that’s what you want to use
this for --
(noticing)

Oh my...
Jason's profile comes up -- it’s covered with pink hearts,
and the name “Mrs. Janet Mendoza” written over and over in
cursive, like it was decorated by a lovestruck 14 year-old.

TAHANI-JANET (CONT’D)

Jason... Janet has a crush on you!
(looks closer)
Sorry, not just a crush... I think, in

one of the reboots, you two were married!

On the screen, we now see the WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT of Jason
and Janet from #110. Jason-Janet reacts, surprised.

Ohhhh. This flatscreen must've been a

make sense.

INT. JANET’S VOID - CHIDI-JANET AND ELEANOR (D1) 1016

 

Chidi-Janet is looking at (the new) Eleanor, confused. She
still doesn’t know what’s going on.

RANDOM PERSON 1
This whole thing sucks, you know?

CHIDI-JANET
Eleanor... you... you’re not --

She is now another NEW PERSON -- a 53 year-old Chinese man.

RANDOM PERSON 2
The one thing I never wanted to do, ever,
for any reason, was follow some guy
around, like a lame puppy dog. I mean --
look at me, I don’t need to do that -- I
can get any guy I want!

 

CHIDI-JANET
Eleanor, just -- hang on --

Eleanor is yet ANOTHER RANDOM PERSON -- an 11 year-old boy.

RANDOM PERSON 3
What, dude? What? What do you want?

All around them, the walls of the void begin to CRACK. Janet
POPS IN and sees “Eleanor.”

JANET
What is going on?!
(notices)
Okay. Well. This is bad.

Eleanor is now an 80 year-old lady.
RANDOM PERSON 4
Why are you staring at me? Do I have a
zit on my nose or something?
JANET
Your sense of self is crumbling, and it’s
taking the void down with it.
She is now a 16 year-old girl.

RANDOM PERSON 5
Great. So I don’t feel like myself for
two seconds and it breaks the universe?!
How come nothing went wrong when Chidi
freaked out about his identity for three
hours?

CHIDI-JANET
Because freaking out about everything is
my identity.
(faux cocky, wilting)
Not to brag!

JANET
You have to hold it together. Try to do
something Eleanor-y -- laugh at someone

who falls down, or show up at an event
underdressed and then get mad at everyone
else somehow. I/’11 be right back --

Janet POPS OUT.

 

1017 INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE - BULLPEN (D1) 1017
Neil walks Michael toward the exit... Janet pops in.
NEIL
Well! I gotta run -- we’re having a

little “thing” in the breakroom for
Marisol’s birthday. She’s turning 39
million -- again.

(chuckles)
So, if there’s nothing else...

MICHAEL
“If there’s nothing else?!" Neil,
please: be logical. Not one Good Place
resident in over five hundred years?!
Not Jonas Salk, not Harriet Tubman, not
one single Golden Girl?! The Bad Place
has hacked your system!

NEIL

(stern)
For the last time: no, they have not, and
frankly, I’m beginning to resent your
tone. If you have a problem, go back to
the Good Place and take it up with the
Committee. Now if you’1ll excuse me,
there’s cake over there, and if I don’t
move quickly, Erika will get the last
corner piece!

 

He stomps off...

MICHAEL
No, no, no. This can’t be happening. He
was supposed to tell us what to do! If
he can’t fix this, who’s going to?

JANET

You, Michael. It has to be you.

(off his look)
We keep wandering around these different
realms, expecting someone else to have
the answers. But no one does. You're
the guy, Michael. You’re the only person
who can fix whatever’s wrong with the
afterlife.

Michael takes this in.

JANET (CONT'D)

But before we get into that, Eleanor’s
identity is shattering, inside my void,
and I might blow up, so I’m gonna need
you to grab a paperclip and marbelize me

like yesterday.
Janet's face starts to crack! Light pours through the cracks!

MICHAEL
What will happen to the humans?

JANET
No idea, but I can’t take them out of my
void in the middle of this office, and if
we do nothing, everyone is gone-zo!
Marbelize me, get us somewhere safe, and
bring me back!

Michael looks around frantically --
MICHAEL
Paperclip! I need a paperclip!
(sees Matt)
Matt! Do you have a paperclip?!
MATT

(scared)
What are you gonna use it for?

1018 INT. JANET'S VOID - SAME TIME (D1 1018

The ground shakes, walls shattering. Eleanor is now a JACKED
BODY-BUILDER.

Chidi? I’m scared.

CHIDI-JANET
I know.

The walls keep cracking. Eleanor is now an OLD MAN.

RANDOM PERSON 7
What am I supposed to be doing right now?
I don’t remember. I’m having a hard
time... remembering...

Chidi-Janet gets an idea. Eleanor keeps becoming DIFFERENT
PEOPLE as Chidi-Janet talks:

CHIDI-JANET

Right. Memories! You need to remember
who you are:

(then)
You’re Eleanor Shellstrop, from Phoenix,
Arizona. Your favorite meal is shrimp
scampi, you listed your emergency contact
as Britney Spears as a longshot way of
meeting her, and your favorite movie is
“that clip of John Travolta saying ‘Adele
Dazeem’.” You flew halfway around the
world because you wanted to be a better
person, and it was very brave.

Within the ever-changing Eleanors, one out of every four is
Eleanor-Janet. Chidi-Janet sees that as a good sign...

CHIDI-JANET (CONT'D)

You’re sharp and you’re strong. You make
fun of me a lot -- you once called me a
“human snooze button” -- but you also
showed up in my classroom when I was
drowning in despair and canned chili, and
basically saved my life. You have very
high self-esteem, and a very low
tolerance for men who wear sandals, and
your worst nightmare is someone saying
something nice about you to your face,
but too bad, because you deserve it, and
I need to say it, because -- because --

Chidi-Janet waits, then sees ELEANOR-JANET and GRABS her and
KISSES HER. It’s a Janet kissing a Janet. The camera SWOOPS
AROUND them. Somewhere, during the kiss, through the magic
of computers, they become ACTUAL ELEANOR and ACTUAL CHIDI.

The cracks in the walls slow. Eleanor looks at herself...

ELEANOR
Nice work, bud.

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Did you mean what you said, or did you
just say it because the world was ending?

CHIDI
...I really wanna play this cool, but I’m
afraid I’m gonna ruin it if I try to be
sexy.
(wilting)
I already ruined it. Saying the word
“sexy” is not sexy --

She kisses him again. The cracked walls start to heal. The
white void turns brilliant colors all around them.

1019 INT. ACCOUNTANT’S OFFICE - BULLPEN - SAME TIME (D1) 1019
Michael is about to marbelize Janet, when --

JANET
Wait! I’m okay.

MICHAEL
--.You’re sure?

JANET
Yes. I’m okay. Wait... uh oh...
(she GAGS)
They’re not Janets anymore... they’re...
them... and they’re not sitting well...
(gags)
Incoming!

She “barfs.” Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason pop in, back
to their normal selves. Michael and a wobbly Janet watch.

JANET (CONT'D)
Oh man. Ugh. That was gross. I feel so
much better.

MICHAEL
On the bright side, they’re all here, and
they’re safe.
A loud ALARM SOUNDS.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
-- From the old scary thing. Now there’s

a new scary thing.

ALARMS BLARE. Neil walks up, wearing a party hat, holding
some cake.

NEIL
Hey guys! I’m Neil. Welcome to
Accounting! Now it does look like the
four of you are interdimensional
fugitives, so I did go ahead and hit the
alarm. Sorry about that! On a lighter
note, we do have some cake left, if
you’re interested.

 

JASON
Yyyyyes!
TAHANT
Michael, what do we do?
MICHAEL
I’m sorry, guys. The Accountant was no
help --
NEIL
Rude.
MICHAEL

-- no one has gotten into the Good Place
in 500 years, and we have no plan.
Nobody’s coming to save us.

He looks at Janet. She nods. He swells up.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
So I’m gonna do it. Follow me!

He SMACKS NEIL’S CAKE out of his hand --

NEIL
Nooo! Corner piece!

-- with Neil distracted they all RUN into --

 

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM/NEIL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS (D1) 1021

JASON

That’s most of the things I’ve tried!
MICHAEL

That's my guy. Get in the tube!
JASON

Oh hell yeah -- I love gettin’ in stuff!

He does. Michael SLAMS THE GREEN BUTTON, Jason FLIES UP into
the tube...

MICHAEL
Well... no way to know what happened to
him. The rest of you -- go!
INT. GOOD PLACE OUTPOST - DAY (Dl 1101

We’re in an old quaint HOUSE. Camera pulls back to reveal a
large ANTIQUE MAILBOX.

We hear: THUNK! THUNK! THUNK! Six times, with accompanying
muffled “Ows!” And “Gahhs!”

DOOR is pushed open. Jason crawls out. Then Chidi, Tahani,
Eleanor, Michael and Janet -- like from a CLOWN CAR. They
look around.

ELEANOR
...Where are we?

MICHAEL
We're in the Good Place.

ELEANOR

No offense dude, but you’ve told us a lot
of lies in the last 300 years, so for
real: where the fork are we?

(realizing)
Fork. Shirt. Ash-hole.

(hearing it, emotional)
Holy forking shirtballs... we’re in the
Good Place!

They all look around, shocked...
