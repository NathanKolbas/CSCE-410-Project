THE BOYS
“The Name of the Game”

FADE IN...

OPEN on COMIC BOOK PICTURES WHIRRING PAST. Golden Age to
Modern Age. Beloved heroes you all know and love -- like
Soldier Boy, Lamplighter, and most of all, the Homelander.
Until the images coalesce into a block of text:

VOUGHT STUDIOS PRESENTS:
Then -- A SNAP OF STATIC TAKES US TO --

YOUTUBE. Hand-held iPhone video of a statuesque warrior
(QUEEN MAEVE) kicking the SHIT out of a robber.

Now Queen Maeve perp-walks the cuffed robber to the waiting
NYPD. Most notable is the CROWD that’s gathered around,
cheering and chanting her name. ,A galaxy of phone FLASHES,
as everyone else records it, too.

The CHRYON along the bottom: “EYEWITNESS FOOTAGE OF QUEEN
MAEVE IN ACTION!”

Which LAUNCHES us into.a fast-paced FIREHOSE RUSH of IMAGES.
TV, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat. A multi-faceted, multi-
media world -- but one thing unites us all:

WE LOVE SUPERHEROES.

E! CHANNEL. VIDEO FOOTAGE of the DEEP, a handsome-as-hell
aquatic hero in a skin-tight suit, in Long Island, comforting
a beached whale. Bystanders call out his name ("DEEP!
DEEP!”) as TWO .E! NEWS ANCHORS dish about his granite abs.

SNAP! A moody, Michael, Bay-style image of THE SEVEN, the
world’s most popular,Superhero Team. Homelander, Queen
Maeve, the Deep, the Lamplighter, others.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The Seven. The greatest Superhero
Team on the planet.
(then)
And now you can bring them home.
Collect all Seven commemorative
glasses from McDonal--

SNAP! It’s a Christian Channel. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, on-stage
in a MEGACHURCH. A big BANNER behind: “CAPES FOR CHRIST.”
Adoring CONGREGANTS clasp their hands in prayer.

CAPTAIN FANTASTIC
And it’s just a few short weeks to
our incredible “Believe” festival,
where we give praise to the most
powerful hero of them all, Je--

SNAP! INSTAGRAM. Video taken from the middle of a
rambunctious crowd that’s WAY LARGER than the others we’ve
seen. POLICE barely hold them back. SHRIEKING FOR --

HOMELANDER! Head of the Seven and the world’s biggest
Superhero. If Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise and John Wayne all gang-
banged. He waves from the red carpet of a UNICEF benefit.
People go FUCKING BANANAS, SHOVE against the cops. It’s like
Beatlemania.

‘Likes’ for this Instagram Post shoot into the stratosphere.

Finally -- a LOCAL NEWS INTERVIEW with a GIRL, 20. She’s
bawling her eyes out.
GIRL
..-he just... Homelander does so
much to protect us... and to be this
close to him, it’s... overwhelming.

Homelander, if you seesthis, Adrian
from Brooklyn loves you, loves you
with all her heart...

We PULL BACK. Revealing we’re watching a FLAT SCREEN --
INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

In an upscale living room. As we meet HUGHIE (20's, slight,
kind). In a “BRYMAN AUDIO VISUAL” shirt. Installing
someone's new TV. As well as their Blu-Ray. Sonos.
Programming their Universal Remote. Hughie does it all. We
see his FINGERS, dexterous and deft. He’s quite the tech
virtuoso.

MOMENTS LATER» He presents the BILL on a clipboard -- to a
WEST SIDE MOM in a New York Power Suit. She only half pays
attention, as she returns work emails on her phone.

HUGHIE
You sure? We’re running a special
on Vimtag Security Cameras. HD.
You can access ‘em from your phone.

WEST SIDE MOM
Thanks but no. I don’t think we
really need ‘em. My nanny’s here
all the time.

Hughie just has one of those sincere, earnest faces. He nods
to the woman’s 7-YEAR-OLD in a HOMELANDER COSTUME, playing
with his Dominican NANNY.

HUGHIE
Course. And you got the Homelander
watching over things.
(off the Mom’s smile)
But, you know, the Homelander can’t
be everywhere at once. Neither can
the cops.

HUGHIE (CONT'D)

Or the nanny, for that matter. No,

if we wanna keep an eye on our kids?

That’s up to us. Even if we’re

working long hours and late nights.

Know what I mean?

Mom looks up from her phone. Clearly a long hour worker.

HUGHIE
Maybe you don’t need the cameras,
but what about that one time you do?
Is there such a thing as too safe?

Off Hughie. Smiling warmly. Making the sale.
INT. BRYMAN AUDIO VISUAL - NIGHT

A Mom-and-Pop ELECTRONICS STORE. TV’s and STEREO EQUIPMENT
on the shelves. Hughie behind the counter. As --

The bell over the door RINGS. ROBIN (20's, girl-next-door
cute) enters. She sidles up to Hughie, as _if a customer --

ROBIN
Excuse me, sin? I want to schedule
an appointment. For you to come
over and -—
(arches an eyebrow)
Lay some cable.

HUGHIE
(smiles)
Robin. That doesn’t mean what you
think it means.

ROBIN
‘Laying cable’ means sex.
HUGHIE
‘Laying pipe’ means sex. ‘Laying

cable’ means you want me to come to
your house and take a shit.

ROBIN
(laughing)
That’s disgusting.

HUGHIE
Hey, you said it.

ROBIN
You ready yet? Despite your best
efforts, I’m still hungry.
EXT. NEW YORK SIDE STREET - NIGHT

OPEN ON A BUS-STOP POSTER. A completely BLACK SUITED HERO in
a cologne ad. “BLACK NOIR for DRAKKAR NOIR.”

As Hughie and Robin, holding hands, walk down an empty SIDE-
STREET. She CHUCKLES at a story he just told --

ROBIN
«..SO you got her from ‘no thanks,’
to four cameras?

HUGHIE
What can I say? I’m a good fucking
salesman.

(off Robin’s eye-roll)
Hey, I got you, didn’t I?

ROBIN
Barely!
(beat)
Speaking of, Mr. Salesman. Did you
ask for the raise?

Hughie takes a half-beat. He knows Robin isn’t going to like
this, but plays it off, casually.

HUGHIE
Gary was totally supportive <- he
just says things are slow., Next
year, though, for sure.

ROBIN
Okay.

Hughie looks at her.) Feels guilty.

HUGHIE
What do you want me to do? Go in
there and kick his ass?

ROBIN
I said ‘okay.’

HUGHIE
But you didn’t mean it. I see that
look. C'mon, let’s hear it.

ROBIN
(sighs, alright)
You’re the best guy there, by a long
shot -- and Gary’s taking advantage
of you -- and yeah, you should get
in there and fight for it.

This is banter, not bickering. A sign of how much they love,
and are comfortable with, each other.

HUGHIE

Jesus. I didn’t realize you needed
a sugar daddy.

ROBIN
Blow me. This is about you getting
what you deserve. Hell, I’m killing
myself at school cause it’s gonna
pay off -- for both of us. I mean,
if we’re moving in together --

Robin takes one step off the curb into the street, about to
cross. But Hughie stops on a dime.

HUGHIE
Wait. What’d you just say?
ROBIN
(breaks into a grin)
Well, we can’t keep -- laying pipe --

at your parent’s place. Trying to
keep quiet, staring up at that dumb
Zeppelin poster.

HUGHIE

(also grins)
Hey. Don’t ever besmirch the

Zeppelin poster.

He’s still on the curb, she’s still one step in the street.
As he leans forward and kisses her. Like none he’s ever had
before -- or ever will again.

Hughie steps back, holding both of Robin’s hands. They’re so
in love, then --

SMASH! Robin is suddenly, shockingly ATOMIZED before
Hughie’s eyes. Blood and gummy bits of viscera spatter
against Hughie’s face. Hughie still holds Robin’s hands.
But that’s all he’s holding. They’re gory, detached.

It happens so fast» Hughie doesn’t have time to react.

As fast-running hero A-TRAIN skids to a stop. Robin’s
insides all over his costumed outsides. He clutches a
distinctive BLUE DUFFEL BAG tight to his chest. The
motherfucker just ran right through Hughie’s girlfriend.

A-Train is straight-up frightened. Jittery as hell. But not
because of what he just did. Then why?

A-TRAIN
(sputtering)
Oh God, I’m -- I’m sorry. But I
can’t stop. I can’t stop.

And with that, A-Train RACES away at supersonic speeds,
leaving a blurred trail of motion in his wake.

And leaving Hughie. Alone. Holding two bloody hands. In

shock, he can’t let them go. Until some emotion -- some
abject horror -- begins to seep in...

WIDE SHOT. Down the street. Hughie is small in the frame.
His voice distant, ragged, wrenching, as finally:

HUGHIE
ROBIN! ROBIN!!

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DES MOINES, IOWA - DAY

A generic Nissan Altima pulls up before a generic office
park. STARLIGHT (20's, blonde, sweet, in a reasonably modest
superhero outfit) climbs out of the passenger seat. She
clutches a HEADSHOT, looks nervous.

But not as nervous as her MOTHER. Who licks her finger,
smooths out Starlight’s eyebrow.

STARLIGHT’S MOTHER
Whatever you do, don’t chew your
thumbnail. And remember to smile.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - WAITING ROOM = DAY

All beige, all the time. Water cooler burps. A table with a
sad, out of date PEOPLE magazine. Metal folding chairs
occupied by a few exotically-garbed SUPERHEROINES. (Let’s
play the clash between the mundane and the superheroic).

Starlight enters, signs in. Nods at one of the other
Superheroines, apparently no love lost.

STARLIGHT
Hey Countess.

COUNTESS
Starlight. Omigod. So good to see
you. Is that a new headshot?

STARLIGHT
No. Same one.

COUNTESS
It’s so nice.

Countess gives a “I’m pretending to like you but I fucking
hate your guts” grin. Starlight smiles back, self-conscious.

From there, we enter a MONTAGE of Starlight’s bizarre
AUDITION. INTERCUTTING:

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - AUDITION ROOM - DAY

VIDEO CAMERA POV. It SNAPS to life. Focusing in on
Starlight. Anxious.

CASTING DIRECTOR (0.S.)
Please slate for the camera.

STARLIGHT
Yeah, I’m, um, Starlight. 5 foot 8,
127 pounds.

CASTING DIRECTOR (0.S.)
Turn around please.

She rotates, an awkward 360 degree turn. Then --

CASTING DIRECTOR (0.S.)
Okay, let’s see it, dear.

STARLIGHT
You should look away --

CASTING DIRECTOR (0.S.)
Sorry?

STARLIGHT
Turn away from camera and shut your
eyes. Or else I’1ll blind you.

CASTING DIRECTOR (0.S.)
Alright. Go ahead.

Starlight concentrates -- it starts with her eyes, which glow
white hot -- then the OVERHEAD FLUORESCENTS FLICKER and FADE,
as she draws energy from her nearby surroundings --

Until her EYES emit a J.J. Abrams-style, blazing LIGHT BURST
that explodes into the room --

The camera FREEZES and FRITZES and RATTLES at the concussive
blast. When it resumes, it’s on its side, Starlight is
crouching over someone just off camera, upset --

STARLIGHT
I’m so sorry, are you alright?

CASTING DIRECTOR (0.S.)
Just fine, dear. Very impressive.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - BATHROOM - DAY

Starlight on the toilet. Clearly peeing. (You never see
superheroes peeing!) Then she reaches beneath her, pulls out
the plastic urine test cup. Begins to label it...

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Starlight sits at a POLYGRAPH. Wears sensors. A bland

technician across from her, taking notes. (Fun fact: these
are real questions from CIA employee interviews. )

TECHNICIAN
Have you ever plotted to overthrow
the United States of America?

STARLIGHT
No.

The Technician inspects the answer. Mutters to himself.
Betrays nothing. Starlight starts chewing her thumbnail.

TECHNICIAN
How do you feel when you see a small
animal in distress?

STARLIGHT
Um. Bad.

TECHNICIAN
Did you ever feel sexual urges when
sitting in your parents’, lap?

STARLIGHT
What? No. God. No.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - AUDITION ROOM - DAY

VIDEO CAMERA POV. Starlight in the midst of an interview.
She speaks with genuine heart.

STARLIGHT
...I was just... like most Super-
Abled, I was born like this. My Mom
was thrilled.) She made me go to all
those little miss hero pageants. I
hated it, I can still smell the
hairspray. And at the Q and A, they
always asked me my wish. And I
always saidy “to save the world.”
The judges chuckled, like it was
cute. But it’s not a joke to me.
Since when did ‘hopeful’ and ‘naive’
become the same thing? Why get into
this business, if not to save the
world? It’s all I’ve ever wanted.
And it’s why all I’ve ever wanted
was to be in the Seven...

Off her pixelated video image...

INT. ROBIN’S PARENTS’ APARTMENT - FEW DAYS LATER

PHOTOS of ROBIN. Surrounded by thick FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS.
A ROOMFUL of somber people in DARK SUITS, eating from small
plates. We notice a WOMAN crying into a MAN’s shoulder.

CLOSE ON HUGHIE. A maelstrom of heartbreak, pain and
emotion, beneath a numb shell. He looks up, sees --

POV. Two CHILDREN in nice clothes, sprawled before the TV.
Watching a “SEVEN” CARTOON. Even here, even now... most
people are FANS...

INT. HUGHIE’S FAMILY APARTMENT - QUEENS - DAY

Hughie returns back to his FAMILY APARTMENT. Tie loosened.
His zaftig MOM follows, along with his wheezing FATHER
(sallow, skinny, rolling an oxygen tank beside him).

Dad thumps on the couch, flips on the TV.

HUGHIE’S MOM
Well, I thought it was“a lovely
service. Just lovely.

Hughie. What’s he supposed.to say? It was awesome?

HUGHIE’S MOM
Did you eat?, Can I -- fix you some
pizza rolls?

HUGHIE
...I’m not hungry.

HUGHIE’S MOM
(noticing the TV)
Oh, honey. Look.

ON THE SCREEN. )Six o’clock news. A PRESS CONFERENCE. A-
TRAIN. Beside VOUGHT VICE-PRESIDENT of HERO MANAGEMENT JULIA
STILLWELL (40's).

Hughie noticeably flinches at this.

JULIA STILLWELL (ON TV)
.».-and as you know, A-Train was
placed on standard administrative
leave until the NYPD could conduct
their investigation. Which they’ve
now concluded -- and have ruled no
wrong-doing. But that doesn’t begin
to convey the terrible regret we all
feel at this awful, tragic loss...

A-TRAIN (ON TV)
My deepest condolences to Robin
Ward’s family. I was chasing those

bank robbers... and she just...
stepped into the middle of the
street... and I couldn’t...

A-Train trails off, choked up. Golden Globe-worthy.

FRIEDMAN. All Clinton-esque, lip-biting sympathy.

DOUG FRIEDMAN
Does a Hugh Campbell live here?

INT. HUGHIE’S FAMILY APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

10.

A small stack of LEGAL DOCUMENTS on a TABLE. Hughie sits in

front of the lawyer. Scans the papers.

Hughie’s Mom observes. Dad stillywatches TV in the back,
seemingly catatonic, wheezing through»his nose tube.

DOUG FRIEDMAN
...really, everyone at Vought is
just... wrecked about Robin...

(then, as a ‘friend’)

Now. You two weren’t married and --
look, technically there’s no legal
claim. But still, Vought wants to
do the “right thing --,offer you 25
thousand in restitution.

HUGHIE’S MOM
(that’s life-changing)
25 thousand!

DOUG FRIEDMAN
It’s the least we could do, ma’am.
You just need to sign -- here -- and
I’1l hand over the check --

HUGHIE

But this -- is a confidentiality

agreement.

DOUG FRIEDMAN
It’s a boiler plate NDA --

HUGHIE
You people say ‘condolences’ and ‘my
regrets’ and ‘our sympathies,’ but
no one can look me in the fucking
eye and say “I’m sorry!” I’m not
signing anything! Now get out!

Doug Friedman pauses a beat, unsure. Hughie charges over to
him, ROUGHLY HAULS HIM OUT OF HIS SEAT!

HUGHIE
I said GET THE HELL OUT!

SMASH CUT TO:

CLOSE ON HUGHIE. Sitting quietly in his seat. That outburst
was just in his imagination. There’s churning lava deep down
inside him. But he’s not .a fighter. Not yet.

DOUG FRIEDMAN
You okay? As I said, a boiler plate
NDA, really pretty standard.

HUGHIE
I’1l think about it.

DOUG FRIEDMAN
Hughie --

Let me think about it.

DOUG FRIEDMAN
I get it. I’11 leave the document,

heavily made-up, Jon Benet-style Starlight, ages 4 thru

10, always jauntily posing, hands-on-hips, wearing a kid-
sized, homemade version of her outfit.

A shrine to a Mother’s pride in her daughter.

In the adjacent kitchen -- Starlight herself, in her grown-up
Superhero outfit, pours some Kraft Shells and Cheese into a

pot.

Keeps one ear on a POLICE SCANNER, which babbles on

about some local loitering and a nasty rash of graffiti.

Her Mother enters -- listens briefly to the scanner --

STARLIGHT’S MOTHER
Any maniacs out there?

STARLIGHT
Quiet night. Like every night.

STARLIGHT’S MOTHER
Too bad. We,could use the press
right now.

WIDER. Hughie sits at their kitchen table. Awkwardly
shuffles notes and papers.

In front of Robin’s Mom and Dad. Mom, red-rimmed eyes, only
stares down at her folded hands.,»Dad also averts eye
contact, impatiently taps his wedding »ring onto his beer
bottle throughout. Clink. Clink.

against A-Train. Heroes are like
cops, they can’t)be charged for
collateral damage while in pursuit.

Robin's Mom wipes away a tear. This is all a painful
subject. Hughie continues --

You took their money? Gene?

Dad stops clinking the beer bottle. Searches Hughie’s face.

ROBIN’S DAD
How long have I known you, Hughie?

HUGHIE
Since -- Robin and me were in high
school.

ROBIN’S DAD
Prom night, actually. We met you,
in that tux two sizes too big -- and
there are some kids who just have
that go-getter spark in their eye.

You were not one of those kids.

I'd say to her all the time, didn’t
I? What’s Robin see in him? Got no
drive, no fire, no fight. Boy
doesn’t give a shit about anything.

HUGHIE
I cared about your daughter. I’m
trying to fight now.

ROBIN’S DAD

Too late. She’s dead. And you
wanna drag out some court case? So
we can relive her death?

Yeah, we took the fucking money.
And now we wanna -- try to -- put it
all behind us.

So what? A-Train just gets away

losing Robin. But we can make

Hughie. Clickclickclickclick. As he enters a bodega.

Who's taking pictures? Off this mystery --
INT. NEW YORK BODEGA - NIGHT

A SIXER of BUD LIGHT. Pulled from the fridge case by Hughie.
He’s on edge.

An edge he goes plummeting right over when --

He pivots in the cramped aisle. Coming face to face with A-
Train! Even worse, a DOZEN A-TRAINS! Side by side!

It’s a magazine rack. A-Train onthe cover of US WEEKLY. He
smiles, hugging a chirpy BALD CANCER KID beneath the headline
“MAKING WISHES COME TRUE.”

Hughie, breathing shallow, backs away. Bumping against an
entire row of CEREAL. Box drops, Hughie looks.

Delicious FROSTED A=TRAINS. A whole fucking ROW of them.

WIDE ANGLE. Hughie. Spinning. Drowning. Now sees -- A-
Train on CANS of MONSTER ENERGY DRINK.

On a CARDBOARD CUT-OUT at the aisle’s end, cerveza in hand --
‘A-TRAIN CELEBRA CINCO DE MAYO.’

A-Train, A-Train, A-Train, A-Train.

The guy murdered the love of Hughie’s life. And everyone
idolizes the asshole.

‘VOUGHT INTERNATIONAL: 2017 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS.’
Along with alternating images of their various projects.
Movie Posters. Theme Parks. Toys. Cartoons. Vought makes
Marvel look like a corn-studded piece of shit.

It’s a good time to be in the
Superhero Business.

The crowd applauds -- Julia holds up her hand, goes sincere --

JULIA STILLWELL
But as we all know, none of that
matters. Because job one? Is
managing, supporting, and advising
the brave heroes who put themselves
in harm’s way each and every day.
For us. Take a look.

The spotlight snuffs out. Inspirational music swells, as a
slickly packaged P.R. video begins on the huge screen. TOMMY
LEE JONES got paid a shit-ton to narrate.

Vought International. Handling the
Business of Superheroes, so
Superheroes can handle their
Business...

INT. THE SEVEN TOWER - ELEVATOR - DAY

Starlight. Flanked by her team. Crowded elevator going up,
up and away. Make-up artist primps Starlight on the fly.

ASHLEY
You know, you’re doing really great
so far...

STARLIGHT
I haven't done anything yet.

ASHLEY
Exactly. And you're already up 2
and a half.points with Midwesterners
and Conservative Christians in 18 to
49. I saw your audition, by the
way. The ‘saving the world’ thing.
Really brilliant.

STARLIGHT
I meant it.

ASHLEY
That’s why we love you. So. You
ready for your life to change?
Starlight’s overwhelmed but elated. Yeah. She thinks so.
INT. THE SEVEN TOWER - AUDITORIUM - DAY
The video continues. Classy Ken Burns style visuals. First,

we see black and white photos of a Captain America-like hero
named SOLDIER BOY.

Superpowered human. To be followed
by more. Dozens more. Men and

extraordinary genetic abilities.
Jonas Salk famously called them ‘a
leap forward in evolution.’ No
one’s quite sure why it happened,
but thank God it did.

Multiple IMAGES of HEROES flit past.

TOMMY LEE JONES (V.O.)

Until, of course, the apex. The
pinnacle. The formation of the most
popular Superhero Team the world’s
ever seen. THE SEVEN.

(crowd goes wild)
Led by -- not just a hero -- but an
American institution.« As»powerful
as he is humble. Ladies and
gentlemen -- the HOMELANDER.

Now the crowd goes WILD. ,As a SPOTLIGHT appears in the
center of stage -- revealing the HOMELANDER. Live and in the
flesh! Giving an aw-shucks wave.

TOMMY LEE JONES (V.O.)
And please welcome the rest of the

Spotlights, BLAZE ON beside the Homelander. Introducing each

moment of Mom’s life.

JULIA STILLWELL

The Seven, ladies and gentlemen!
How about ‘em!?

The thunderous clapping continues, as well as a universe of
iPhone flashbulbs. Starlight can’t help but steal glances at
the Homelander. The Deep leans over, whispers to her,
charming, disarming.

DEEP
(re: Homelander)
I know. It’s kinda like sharing a
stage with God, right? But you
wanna know something? He chews. with
his mouth open. Spits little bits
of salad right at you.

Starlight smiles at the-Deep. Grateful to have someone bring
all this back down to,earth.

EXT. BRYMAN AUDIO VISUAL - NIGHT

POV. From across the street. We see Hughie, through the
window, downcast as he upsells some equipment.

REVEAL -- we're in a boat of a Cadillac. Behind the wheel --

Enigmatic, he reaches into his GLOVE COMPARTMENT. Tugs out a
CIGAR BOX. Opens it, revealing --

A PILE of FAKE IDENTIFICATION CARDS. All with his picture.
NYPD, FDNY, NSA, DEA, ATF, DHS, some foreign CARDS. He
shuffles through them, before choosing an FBI ID. Perfect.

Goes without saying -- who the HOLY FUCK is Butcher?
INT. BRYMAN AUDIO VISUAL - NIGHT

A TELEVISION SCREEN. ACCESS HOLLYWOOD. Some b-roll footage
of Starlight, waving shy to the crowd at the Vought
stockholder meeting.

NATALIE MORALES (V.O.)
...and how does newest Seven member
Starlight keep her beach-ready bod?
The answer might surprise you...

Hughie. Before a CUSTOMER. He doesn’t notice the TV --

HUGHIE
...no, you want. the carbon cables.
Cost more, but they conduct
electricity way better --

When the BELL over the door RINGS. Hughie jerks his head up,
illogically hoping against hope that Robin walks through the
door. Of course, she doesn’t. \Instead, he spots --

Butcher. Strolling ins He inspects a section of NANNY-CAMS.
Hughie steps up --

HUGHIE
You interested in a nanny cam?
We're running a special on Vimtag...

Butcher looks up. He’s got a blue collar BRITISH ACCENT. A
lot like Michael Caine.

BUTCHER
Tell me. How many nannies go around
shakin’ their babies, d’you reckon?

HUGHIE
Sorry?

BUTCHER

Goes to show. The bollocks you can
make people swallow, if you get ‘em
scared enough.

HUGHIE
(long beat)
Okay. Is there anything I can help
you with?
BUTCHER

I’m not gonna piss you about,
Hughie. I know what happened to
Robin. Fuckin’ diabolical.

HUGHIE
I’m sorry, who are you?

BUTCHER
She wasn’t in the street. She was
one step off the fuckin’ curb. And
you didn’t take the pay-off.
Respect that.

HUGHIE

I said who. the hell are you? How do
you know that?

BUTCHER
Butcher’s the name. People call me
Billy. I was thinkin’ we could have
a bit of a chat?

OPEN ON: the FBI CARD. Hughie inspects it --

Hughie. Butcher. Pass more and more pedestrians, as they
near the neon atomic blast of Times Square...

HUGHIE
You’re a Fed? You don’t sound like
a Fed.

BUTCHER

BUTCHER
Well, it’s right there in black an’

looksie up me bum to be sure, you go
right ahead.

HUGHIE
Um. So what, exactly, can I do for
you?

BUTCHER

It’s what I can do for you, my son.

Help you get payback for yer girl.
(off Hughie)

You ain’t alone, Hughie, happens a

lot more than you think. Supes, lose

over a hundred people a year to

collateral damage --

HUGHIE
That can’t be true.
(off Butcher)
That’s true?

It’s not that they ain’t strong,
it’s that they don’t care. We’re
just ants to them.

HUGHIE
C'mon.» It’d be all over the news,
people’dbe.screaming bloody murder.

BUTCHER
Might be the odd mention now an’
again, like with Robin. But there’s
a lot more they don’t tell you --
that gets swept under the rug --

 

HUGHIE
Why?

BUTCHER
It ain’t obvious?

He holds his hand out.

WIDE SHOT. TIMES SQUARE. 50 foot high SCREENS:
Wahlberg-esque HERO reclines in his Calvin Klein
whiteys. A-Train in a NIKE SHOE spot. A MOVIE:

But you don’t know half the shit

Spank the bastards, they ever step

HUGHIE

Thank you for an extremely... weird

this is... and I think I should
probably get back.

BUTCHER

Mate. Once I go, I’m gone. This is

your one an’ only. Besides, what’ve

you got to lose, you ain’t already

lost?
CLOSE ON HUGHIE. Thinking. Off this --
We PAN OFF Hughie and Butcher, to the GLEAMING SEVEN TOWER --
INT. THE SEVEN TOWER - BOARDROOM - NIGHT
Starlight. Taking in the PANORAMIC VIEW from the SEVEN

BOARDROOM. 99th floor. Floor to ceiling windows. City
lights before her -- like her own private galaxy.

She pivots to the SEVEN’S FAMOUS CONFERENCE TABLE. Runs her
hand over HOMELANDER’S CHAIR. Tastefully embossed with his
name. Like touching the President’s chair.

Then... she sees... a CHAIR WITH HER NAME ON IT. Her eyes
glisten with emotion.

INT. THE SEVEN TOWER - HALLWAY - NIGHT - LATER

CLOSE ON A SMALL FISHBOWL. With an exotic fish inside -- an
electric blue ram cichlid, to be exact.

WIDER. Starlight carries the fishbowl down the sleek
hallway. Reaches a DOOR. RINGS the bell.

No answer. She KNOCKS. The door drifts open. Unlocked.

STARLIGHT
Hello? Deep?

INT. THE SEVEN TOWER - DEEP’S ROOM - NIGHT

Starlight steps in, tentative. Deep’s apartment is MASSIVE.
All blonde wood and trickling waterfalls and koi ponds and

Chinese writing. Not just aquatic -= Zen aquatic.
STARLIGHT
Just wanted to thank you for being
so ki...

She feels awkward. Certainly doesn’t want to trespass.
She’s about to turn and leave when...

She hears an unmistakable GROANING. Sickly. Sounds like
someone might be ill? Or in trouble?

STARLIGHT
Hello?

She cautiously moves to the sound source. Then steps around
a thick tangle of bamboo trees to see --

THE DEEP. Bites a RUBBER TUBE wrapped tight around his arm.

As he SHOOTS a syringe of BRIGHT BLUE LIQUID into his vein.
What the hell is that stuff?

A PRETTY GIRL in a PARTY DRESS sprawls next to him. Her eyes
flutter, nearly unconscious. A SYRINGE JUTS from her arm.

Deep makes eye contact with Starlight. Who’s horrified --

DEEP
What the FUCK?

STARLIGHT
Oh my God, sorry, I’m sorry --

Deep stands. He’s furious. Aggressive. And completely
different than the charming hero Starlight met.

DEEP
You just walk in??

STARLIGHT
(sputtering)
I knocked... your door was... I was
just bringing you...

She lamely holds out the fishbowl.

DEEP
Turn around. Forget this ever
happened.

But Starlight notices the girl. A thick gob of spittle at
the side of her mouth.

STARLIGHT
Is she... okay?

That sends Deep over the edge. SUDDENLY, with SUPER
STRENGTH, he SHOVES Starlight against the wall!

She drops the FISHBOWL. CRASH!

Scary, Deep clamps his hand around Starlight’s neck. His
forehead veins are popping, he’s so pissed. (It’s a roid-
like reaction to the mysterious blue drug).

DEEP.
Who the HELL asked you??!!

STARLIGHT
(small, scared)
...I think» she needs help...

DEEP

Oh, you’re the fucking hero?

Please. You’re here cause we needed
a few more points with Evangelicals.
There’s a dozen blonde cunts that
fit the bill. You're nobody.

(then)

You breathe a word of this to
anyone? You’re out. For good. The
fuck back to Iowa. We clear?

CLOSE ON STARLIGHT. Just staring at the dying exotic fish,
FLOPPING ABOUT on the floor. Does she fight back? Make a
stand? A long beat...

No. She doesn’t. She does what she needs to do.

Of course. I won’t tell anybody.

He lets her go. She beats a HASTY RETREAT --
EXT. THE SEVEN TOWER - HALLWAY

She scrambles out the door. Then stops. Presses her back
against the wall, out of breath.

It takes every fiber of her being not to cry...
EXT. ALLEY - OLD MONEY BUILDING - NIGHT

Back alley. A SERVICE ENTRANCE behind a tall, ornate, old-
money downtown building.

Butcher strides to the door, Hughie in tow. KNOCKS on it.
Beat. A NERVOUS SECURITY GUARD answers (dark coat, tie,
BADGE). Hughie watches this exchange, curious.

SECURITY GUARD
Fuck, man.

BUTCHER
This is the last time, Harry.

SECURITY GUARD
It’s always the last time. This is
fucking police brutality.
(nods, inside)
You know what these people’1ll do to
me, they catch me letting you in?

BUTCHER
(cool, even)
Not even half of what I’1l do, if
you don’t.

Butcher smiles but never breaks eye contact. It’s
unsettling. Message received.

The Security Guard hands over two SECURITY BADGES. Butcher
gives one to Hughie.

HUGHIE
Did he just say you’re a cop?

BUTCHER
Cop, Fed, it’s all the same to that
cunt. Here, put this on.

HUGHIE
What the hell is this?

But Butcher just strides inside. Uneasy, and now a bit
suspicious, Hughie follows --

INT. OLD MONEY BUILDING - PRIVATE CLUB - NIGHT

DING! CLOSE ON HUGHIE as the ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS. His jaw
hits the floor. As he takes in --

A PRIVATE CLUB. Dark. Thumping music. Lots of SIDE ROOMS
and various nooks and crannies.

AND SUPERHEROES. Male and female. All shapes and sizes and
colors. PARTYING THEIR COSTUMED ASSES OFF. The female
heroes are having as much rambunctious fun as the men. It’s
like Studio 54 -- multiplied by 54.

One FEMALE HERO with a tiara tightens her FLUORESCENT ROPE,
S&M style, around a HOG-TIED NAKED MAN. He happily begs to
be spanked, she happily obliges.

Two HEROES TELEKINETICALLY HURL a CHAIR over a ducking
WAITER, SMASHING it through the window, as if they were
Whitesnake on the Sunset Strip.

Hughie and Butcher step over a burly STEEL-SKINNED SUPERHERO,
passed out on the floor in a pool of his owny)sick. WAITERS
try to drag him away, but he’s far too heavy.

Hughie is absolutely gobsmacked. Then spots --

HUGHIE
Hey, that’s Captain Fantastic. The
‘Capes ‘for Christ’ guy. Holds those
anti-gay rallies.

POV. The stretchy Superhero we saw on TV in the opener is in
ecstasy, wrapped around THREE MEN in G-STRINGS.

BUTCHER
And now he’s the meat in the
Manwich. Fuckin’ hypocrite. Like
Bill Cosby in spandex.

They pass a HERO, his hair a SHIMMERING WAVE of FIRE, quietly
and desperately crying to himself. Who knows why.

HUGHIE
Okay. So this is more than I ever,
ever wanted to see. I’m leaving now
before one of them tries to have sex
with me. Or kill me. Or both.

 

BUTCHER
Not yet.

THE MONITOR. Time-stamped security cam footage of a BACK
ROOM. A-TRAIN. Throws back shots like it’s his job.

HUGHIE
A-Train’s -- here?

BUTCHER
Was. This is from last night.

THE MONITOR. Suddenly, A-Train looks 0.S., as --

A-Train. Your girlfriend’s here.
She's pissed.

A HERO -- BIG GAME =- enters. He carries two MANNEQUIN ARMS.

BIG GAME

Vought Vice-President Julia Stillwell skims down the Tower's

You don’t need to salt my wounds.

No disrespect. But you know police

Cut to the chase, Julia. Who are
you proposing?

meeting her idol in such circumstances. Subtly tries to
cover her neck bruises with her hand.

When Queen Maeve pivots to Starlight. Long beat. Is Maeve
going to say something? But then --

Queen Maeve gently pulls Starlight’s hand away from her neck.
Inspects the bruising.

Then... Maeve reaches into her clutch, pulls out a bottle of
skin tone CONCEALER. Holds it up to Starlight’s neck. With
compassion --

QUEEN MAEVE
I think this is your color.

Implying that Starlight should cover up the bruise. Maybe
even implying that Maeve"s been there herself.

Then -- Queen Maeve pivots for the door. Calls out, without
looking back.
QUEEN MAEVE
Translucent, you’re such a fucking
perv.
Queen Maeve exits. Beat. Then... Translucent the invisible

What did he mean, ‘he can’t stop?’
And what was in that bag? All
sounds bleedin’ dodgy to me.

(off Hughie)
So the big question is: where was he
runnin’?

HUGHIE
Or who was he running from?

Butcher regards Hughie. Impressed. Smart.

BUTCHER
Yeah. True. Good point.
(beat)
Figure that out, we’ll have the
fucker. Got a nose for this shit,
and I’m tellin’ you, I can smell it.

Hughie stares at the reports. Feels emboldened.

Okay. How can I help?

Ring Vought. Tell ‘em you’1ll take
the money, sign the NDA. But only
if A-Train’s there in person when
you do.

HUGHIE
Wait, I don’t... why would I...?

BUTCHER

I dunno. Say you gotta shake his
hand. For closure. They’ll invite
you into the Seven Tower to meet
him. Past their security. And
then, my son, you are gonna stick a
bug in the place. We’l1l have a
listen, really see what’s going on.

HUGHIE
So, sorry -- you want me to go into
the Seven tower? By myself? And
plant -- a bug? Like I’m fucking
James Bond?

BUTCHER
Hughie. Why do you think I came to
you in the first.place? For the
good of me health?

Again, Hughie’s breathing grows.shallow. He pales. Starting
to have another PTSD attack.

HUGHIE

You gotta come with me.
BUTCHER

No waythey give me a pass.
HUGHIE

What if something goes wrong?
BUTCHER

It won’t.
HUGHIE

Oh. Okay. Really comforting. And
easy for you to say, as you sit out
here on your “arse.” I mean, you’re
FBI, if you’re fucking FBI, get a
warrant, why do you need me --

BUTCHER

(a bald lie, of course)
I got a warrant. But that place is
fire-walled and untappable and
locked up tighter than a nun’s

I just -- I can’t» I’m just gonna

fuck it up. You won’t have your bug

Hughie stands. Exits.

Off Butcher. He doesn’t look upset. He smirks, confident,
sips from his club soda. As if he expected this --

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

Butcher. Emerging from the bar. Calmly strolling.

When -- far overhead --,A HERO SOARS through the night sky,
lit by city lights»Followed by ANOTHER. It’s that last one
who's got Butcher’s attention. He’s pretty far away, but
eagle eyed viewers might recognize him as the HOMELANDER.

Just that everything’s great. Just

ANNIE
Yeah. I’m fine.
Hughie pulls a CLOTH HANDKERCHIEF out of his pocket.
Crosses to Annie. Holds it out.
She gives him an odd look. After what she’s been through,
she’s not ready to accept a kindness from a stranger.
ANNIE
No thanks.
HUGHIE
(self-conscious)
I know. Cloth handkerchief. I’m
not really 90 years old, it’s just
my Dad was in dry cleaning, he
insists I carry -- never mind.
Sorry to bother you.
Hughie pivots away. Annie looks after him -- the guy’s just
trying to offer a little, compassion in a cruel world.
ANNIE
No, wait. Actually, thank you,
I'd... appreciate it.

Hughie hands her the handkerchief. She dries her eyes.

ANNIE
Just having a bad day, that’s all.

HUGHIE
That makes two of us. Work thing or
life thing?

Beat. No one’s been willing or able to listen to Annie.
Now, finally, this stranger is.

But then there I was... I needed to
fight. Had to. But -- I didn’t.

Kept my eyes down, mouth shut, did
what it took to keep my job. Turns
out I’m not who I thought I was.
And I think -- I think I just wanna
go home.

Hughie gives her a long, serious look.

ANNIE
Sorry, I didn’t mean to dump all
that on --
HUGHIE
No, it’s not that. It’s just, I can
relate, I’m -- long story.

Listen. Do you like your job?

ANNIE
It’s the only thing I ever wanted.

HUGHIE
And it’s a good job? You don’t get
kids hooked on smokes or anything?

ANNIE
It’s)a great job. I could help a
lot of, people.

CLOSE ON HUGHIE. A flash of vulnerability. Thinking of his
fear of A-Train. Thinking of Robin.

HUGHIE

Thing is, I -- I knew this girl.
Who'd just -- charge headfirst into
everything. Me, I backed away from
everything, I was... I dunno...
scared of falling or failing. But
she'd say ‘just cause you fall on
your ass, doesn’t mean you gotta
stay there.’

Hughie glances at her. She’s right.

Oh, uh, okay. Sorry.
Crash and burn. She goes. Who is this guy?

Oh, no, I’m excited to be here. I’m

seat -- notices some STRAY DOG TOYS. »Bright, cutesy, squeaky
rubber animals. Seems out of character for Butcher.

HUGHIE
You have a dog?

BUTCHER
No.

Butcher doesn’t elaborate further. On Hughie -- umkay.

BUTCHER
Give us your phone.

Hughie complies. Butcher pops it out of its case. Then
pulls out a BUG» As wide and thin as a silver dollar.

BUTCHER
Security won't find it, or the X-
ray.

Butcher hides the bug in Hughie’s phone case, clicks the
phone back in place OVER it --

BUTCHER
Now, what they’1l probably do is
take you to the boardroom. Give it
a minute, say you need a crap. Take
out the bug when you’re in the bog.
Glue’s there on one side, see? Go
back, stick it under the boardroom
table, that’s that.

Ashley smiles, thin. She’s used to working with Gods. Not

Ashley leads Hughie through the SECURITY CHECKPOINT. He
anxiously flits his eyes at --

POV’s. HEAVY FUCKING HARDWARE.) SECURITY GUARDS with semi-
automatics. SURVEILLANCE CAMS mounted everywhere.

machine. Hughie walks through the metal detector, eyes on

X-RAY TECH
Sir, may )I.examine your phone?
HUGHIE
Uh -- sure.

Hughie’s about to have a heart attack. As the X-Ray Tech
carefully pores over the phone. Turns it around. Is he
gonna pop it from its case? Find the bug? This seems to
last FUCKING FOREVER. Hughie sweats bullets. Until --

BEEP! The desk INTERCOM comes to life.

Won't be long, Mr. Campbell.

Steels himself. He-can do this. This is it.

Stands up. Heads to the door. Reaches for the knob --

The door suddenly swings open! And A-TRAIN enters, followed
by Ashley, various HANDLERS, and Doug Friedman -- who begins
to lay out the documents on the table.

CLOSE ON HUGHIE.. Face-to-face with A-Train. Nose to nose.
Tete-a-tete. The source of all his misery. Anger. Anxiety.

DOUG FRIEDMAN
Just to be clear, A-Train’s apology
isn’t an admission of any sort of
culpability whatsoever, do you
understand?

Hughie manages a nod. The Lawyer gives A-Train the okay.

A-TRAIN
(a sullen 3rd grader)
Hey, man. I’m sorry what happened
to your girlfriend. Alright?

A-Train reaches out his hand to shake.

Hughie enters, heads into a stall.

INSIDE THE STALL. Heysits on the toilet. Wrenches his phone
from its case. But if your case is anything like mine,
that’s never, ever easy. He tugs a bit too hard --

The phone CLACKS to the floor! Even worse, so does the BUG!
Which spins like a quarter before landing on the linoleum.
It’s still in the stall, but right beneath the door, in plain
view if anyone was looking for it --

Hughie. Shit. Which escalates into FUCK when --

The door opens and SOMEONE ENTERS. Hughie freezes. He can’t
tell who it is, he only spots boots. But we can see --

It’s STARLIGHT. She moves to the sink, stares in the mirror,
gets her game face back on. If she saw Hughie, she’d
recognize him!

washing his hands of the whole sordid business...

INT. BRYMAN AUDIO VISUAL - NIGHT
WHAM! Hughie is SHOVED BACK into a wall of TV’s. Some CRASH

to the floor, LIVE WIRES SPARKING! As Hughie gets his ASS
KICKED by an invisible man.

TRANSLUCENT (0.S.)
Who was that guy you were with?! In
the car?
With admirable bravery, Hughie doesn’t answer --
So he’s THROWN again. CRASH! OUCH!

TRANSLUCENT (0.S.)
Who was he?? He put you up to this?

HUGHIE
I don’t know! He was just a fucking
Uber driver, okay?!

TRANSLUCENT (0.S.)
Why’d you plant the bug??

HUGHIE
...please... please...
We can SEE -- HEAR -- the crunch of glass». As Translucent

stalks closer to Hughie. Closer.

TRANSLUCENT (0.S.)
Think you can just fuck with us?
We're the Seven!) Earth’s Most
Mighty! Champions.of the Innocent!

This is it. Curtains for Hughie. Fat Lady steps up to the
mike, clears her throat, and --

SMASH! !

BUTCHER'S CAR CAREENS THROUGH THE STORE’S FRONT WINDOW!
SHATTERING THE GLASS. DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HUGHIE!

KNOCKING TRANSLUCENT, CLEAR ACROSS THE ROOM. We can tell,
from the CRUNCH of his body on the windshield, from the THUD
against a collapsing shelf of ELECTRONICS.

Butcher climbs out of the car. For some reason, he holds a
sparking CATTLE PROD (stay tuned for why).

BUTCHER
Hughie, run.
(Hughie hesitates)
Fuckin’ run!

Hughie scrambles for the back room of the store -- as Butcher
straightens up, pivots to Translucent --

BUTCHER
Let him be, you invisible cunt.

TRANSLUCENT (0.S.)
Who are you?

BUTCHER
I’1l1 tell you who you are. A
fuckin’ joke, mate.

TRANSLUCENT (0.S.)
That so?

BUTCHER
Translucent doesn’t even mean
‘invisible,’ you silly twat. It
means ‘semi-transparent.’

Butcher LUNGES with the CATTLE PROD. But he misses -- not so
easy to fight an invisible man.

Translucent RIPS the CATTLE PROD out of Butcher’s HAND.
Hurls it out of reach. SHIT.

INT. BRYMAN AUDIO VISUAL - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON HUGHIE. Darting past boxes and equipment, about to
escape out the back. He opens the door =-—

And STOPS. Who is he gonna be? Someone who backs down? Or
someone who fights?

When he sees, on a rack infront of him -- some CARBON
COMPONENT CABLES. He looks at them. Thinking.

INT. BRYMAN AUDIO VISUAL - CONTINUOUS

WHACK! Translucent punches Butcher across the jaw. Then --
WHACK! Another hit. Butcher only grins, his teeth red.

Then ingeniously SPITS BLOOD in Translucent’s FACE. We see
the spattered BLOOD FLOATING IN MID-AIR.

BUTCHER
There you are.

Butcher SWINGS -- CONNECTS! But then --

Translucent HITS BACK. Over and over. Harder and harder.
It doesn't look good for Butcher. Until --

Suddenly, Hughie is THERE! He PULLS the FIRE ALARM!
WATER SPRAYS from OVERHEAD SPRINKLERS --

Revealing TRANSLUCENT. WATER SPLASHES over his BODY!

HUGHIE
The TV!

Butcher glances -- spots a SMASHED TV on the ground, throwing
sparks into a growing PUDDLE.

CONTINUED:

Butcher gets what Hughie’s saying -- he nods -- UNLOADS a
CRUSHING ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH on Translucent -- OOF -- sends the
bastard flailing back into the sparking WATER --

Which immediately ELECTROCUTES HIM! SPARKS CLIMACTICALLY
RIDE UP Translucent’s body. Before he DROPS.

Dust-settling beat.

The sprinklers stop. Nothing on the floor but a puddle with
the outline of an invisible body in it.

HUGHIE
(out of breath)
Is he dead?

Butcher gives a HARD KICK to Translucent. No noise out of
him, no movement --

BUTCHER
Well, he ain’t movin’.

HUGHIE
Shit. Shit.

BUTCHER
How'd you know electricity
bollocksed the cunt? Took me
forever to work that one out.

HUGHIE
Skin's carbon. Highly conductive.
Saw it on ‘Ellen.’

BUTCHER
Nice one, Hughie. Well, come on.
We gotta get him in the trunk.

HUGHIE
Wait -- we what?

BUTCHER
Think you just offed a member of the
Seven.

HUGHIE

Me? You hit him!

BUTCHER
Semantics, my son, we’re both in a
fucksight a’ trouble.

Already, they can hear SIRENS in the distance --
HUGHIE
No, he attacked us! And you’re --

you're a federal officer! Call the
fucking FBI!

BUTCHER
Yeah. I ain’t really a fed.

Off Hughie -- FUCKING WHAT?
EXT. THE SEVEN TOWER - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

STARLIGHT. On the ROOF of the Seven Tower -- taking in the
infinite constellation of the city below.

PUSH IN ON HER. Her anger, her frustration, boiling and
churning inside. Rising up.

Her eyes begin to glow. Then FLARE.

WIDE. The tower’s top floors -- really, all nearby lights --
FLICKER and BLACK OUT dramatically. Around Starlight. As
she draws energy from them. As her eyes BLAZE like FIRE.

The other Supes might not see theydefiant spark inside her.
Not yet. But we sure do.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT
A PRIVATE JET SOARS.
INT. PRIVATE JET/EXT. SKY =. NIGHT

A PICTURE. The Homelander. “To Mason: Reach for the Sky!
Best, Homelander.” \We've seen this photo before.

The Mayor of Baltimore's son MASON, 10. Draws at a desk in
bit lip concentration, tries to replicate his beloved
Homelander photo with a crayola-on-paper version.

His Dad (the Mayor) dozes in a leather chair. Various AIDES
work or sleep.

When -- Mason happens to glance out the window. He
brightens. His wildest dreams coming true --

POV. ON THE WING. THE HOMELANDER. Proud. Hands on hips.
Cape swirling, Zack Snyder-style. He smiles at Mason.

MASON
Homelander! Dad, wake up! The
Homelander’s here!

The Mayor rouses -- what? He heads over to the window, along
with the aides. They all grin -- major celeb sighting.

MAYOR
Look at that. What’s he doing here?

MASON

Did he come to say goodbye? Are you
guys friends??

CONTINUED:

POV. ON THE WING. The Homelander. Without ever losing his
smile, he looks down to the ENGINE --

And FIRES BLINDING RED BEAMS from his eyes! Flaring camera!
Right at the turbine -- SLICING IT RIGHT OFF --

MAYOR
OH MY GOD!

Guess the Mayor lost the negotiation, after all. THE PLANE
JOLTS. GOING DOWN.

Mason. Open-mouthed in shock and fear. Painfully learning
the old adage -- never, ever meet your heroes.

Homelander, still genially smiling, gives them a friendly
salute. Before FLYING OFF --

STAY WITH THE HOMELANDER. Watching, blank-faced. As the JET
NOSE DIVES. Plummets down to the»Atlantic.

Turns out, Homelander wears a mask, too. »And what’s behind
it is psychopathic, unhinged. And all-powerful. Off this --

BLACKOUT!
