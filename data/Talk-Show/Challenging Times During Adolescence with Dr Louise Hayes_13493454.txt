OAK PARK, ILLINOIS - PRESENT

INT. CLASSROOM — DAY

A public school geometry class in a well-to-do school
district a few miles west of Chicago.

MONROE “MO” KAUFMAN (16) - Sits somewhere near the back of
the room not really paying attention to anything.

The door opens and a uniformed police officer walks inside
with the Principal. They whisper something in the teacher's
ear then turn to the class.

PRINCIPAL
Monroe.

Mo looks up.

MO
Yeah?

SCHOOL HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

A sea of students split in half as the officer leads Mo,
handcuffed, down the hallway. He is a foot shorter than any
of the other students.

MO (V.O.)
I know it seems bad, and for
anybody else it probably would be,
it would be very bad. But Zeke said
this might happen, and while this
is the biggest jam he has ever
gotten me into, it’s definitely not
the first.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 6 YEARS

KATE KAUFMAN (16) watches TV on the couch, she is holding a
bowl of popcorn.

Our narrator is her younger brother, Monroe.

MO (V.O.)
I was ten when I met Zeke and
immediately I knew, I didn’t care
where he was going. I wanted to be
along for the ride.
INT —- KAUFMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME
MUSIC FADES UP: FLEETWOOD MAC - YOU MAKE LOVING FUN

We see a pair of hands go into the freezer and pull out a
bottle of vodka. These hands belong to ISAAC “ZEKE” PRESANTI.
As soon as the glasses of Vodka are poured he puts the bottle
under the water faucet and carefully refills the exact amount
of liquid that he took out.

He is singing along with the music the whole time.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zeke walks into the room holding the two drinks. He is
seventeen with shaggy red hair. He sit’s down on the couch
next to Kate. She takes the drink and studies it for a second
then takes a sip, he smiles.

MO (V.O.)
Zeke was my sister’s boyfriend. I
don’t know if they called
themselves that though. I only ever
saw him on Tuesday nights. That was
my parents date night. For all I
knew he had other girlfriends who
baby-sat their brothers on Monday,
Wednesday and Thursday. But what
was I gonna do? Kate was a big
girl. And I was not a big guy.

Zeke and Kate start making out and we slowly pan up to the
top of the stairs where a 10-year-old MO is watching them
through the gaps in the railing.

EXT. THEME PARK - ANOTHER TUESDAY NIGHT

Mo, Kate and Isaac are walking though the carnival. Mo has a
giant cotton candy in his hand. Zeke rips off a chunk from
the top.

MO(V.O.)
The doctor told my parents I was in
the eighth percentile for my age
group.

The three of them sit in a row playing that game where you
shoot a water gun at a balloon and try to pop it.
MO (V.O.)
That means if you lined up a
hundred random ten-year-olds,
ninety two of them would be taller
than me.

Zeke lifts a hammer high in the air and brings it down hard
on the high striker, the bell rings and the lights flash. The
ride operator hands Monroe a stuffed turtle.

MO(V.O.)
Those other seven kids must live in
Hawaii or something because I had
yet to meet a ten year old smaller
than me.

A group of girls come up and flirt with Zeke, feeling his
muscles and squeezing Monroe’s cheeks. Isaac picks up Monroe
and throws him over his shoulder spinning him around. The
girls love it. Kate comes back with two hot dogs and pulls
Isaac away from the girls.

MO(V.O.)
I knew he used me to hit on girls.
Which should have made me mad...

We see the three of them in line to ride a roller coaster. Mo
is too short to get on. Zeke pulls the ride operator aside
and speaks to him for a minute.

We see Zeke and Mo sitting next to each other on the roller
coaster, screaming with excitement.

INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

The three of them sit in the dark, the lights of the action
movie splashed across their faces. Isaac pulls two beers out
of his jacket. He gives one to Kate and cracks the other for
himself. Monroe looks at Isaac holding his drink. Isaac
checks to see that Kate isn’t looking and let’s Mo take a sip
of the beer. He grimaces at the taste and Zeke laughs.

MO (V.O.)
..-But I didn’t really care because
in my head I kept coming back to
that row of a hundred 10-year-olds.
And I'd think if you lined them all
up in order from tallest to
shortest-—
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

Kate, Mo and their parents watch Zeke play in a big football
game. He has the ball and charges down the field, plowing
through every player on his path to the end zone.

MO
-Zeke could beat the crap out of
every one of them.
The Kaufman family cheers for Zeke along with everybody else.

We watch from Kate’s POV as a cheerleader jumps into Zeke’s
arms.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT

Kate and Zeke are having an intense argument. Mo watches from
the top of the stairs.

MO (V.O.)

I couldn’t really blame her when
she broke up with him. But he
didn’t cheat on me so...

EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Zeke storms out of the house.

MONROE
Where are you going?

Mo is barefoot in his pajamas. Zeke doesn’t even turn around
when he speaks, he just keeps moving towards the car. Mo
chases after him.

ZEKE
Go back inside Mo.
MO
Can I come with you?
ZEKE
No man. Your sister wouldn't like
that.
MO

Now you care what she would like?

Zeke laughs at the quick wit of such a squeaky little voice.
ZEKE
I have things I have to do.

MO
I won’t get in the way, I swear.
Just for tonight.
Zeke looks at him for a second.
ZEKE
Alright fine, but I’m bringing you
home in an hour.
Mo walks around to the passenger side of the car.
MO
What are we going to do for an

hour?

DISSOLVE TO:

AN EMPTY PARKING LOT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
MUSIC: Toots and the Maytals - Take me Home, Country Roads

SLOW MOTION: Zeke’s dark green 1978 Mercedes SLC 170 comes
spinning into view.

The boys scream at the top of their lungs as the car does
donuts all around the lot.

MAIN TITLES - BIG TIME ADOLESCENCE

MONROE (V.O.)
That hour lasted six years.

The green mercedes spins to a stop.

Monroe sits in the front seat he is 16 years old and scrawny
as ever. In the driver’s seat Zeke is 23, he’s tall, handsome
and well built with dark hair and a goofy smile.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXTREME CLOSE UP - A SYRINGE FILLING UP WITH LIQUID
EXTREME CLOSE UP - ALCOHOL SWAB RUBBING SKIN

EXTREME CLOSE UP - NEEDLE GOING IN TO ABDOMEN
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mo is sitting on an examination table, giving himself a shot.
His parents and a doctor look on.

Mo shrugs.

DOCTOR
You are getting good at that.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
What’s wrong.

SHERRI
I think he is upset he isn’t as
tall as he thought he would be.

MO
I thought I would get like...really
tall.

DOCTOR

(finding this amusing)
No no, It won’t make you any taller
than you were always meant to be,
the shots just help to keep you
growing at the same pace with your
peers.

MO
But I’m not.

REUBEN
I’m with Mo on this, I’m spending a
fortune for these shots and he’s
still... (he indicates Mo’s height
with his hands)

DOCTOR
You really don’t need to worry.
Most patients with growth hormone
deficiency's like this don’t start
reaching potential until they are
at least eighteen.

SHERRI
(looking at her watch)
We need to get him back to school.

DOCTOR
Okay let’s do this. When do you
turn sixteen?
MO
Next week.

DOCTOR
You get your license?

Mo nods.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Let’s meet again in six months, if
you aren’t starting to make
improvements, we can talk about
other strategies.

EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
Mo's parents pull up in front of the school, he get’s out.

SHERRI
Don’t forget your lunch.

He takes the lunch bag from her. We see Mo start to walk into
school as soon as his parents pull away he runs back out to
the parking lot. To a car parked on the other side.

Zeke’s POV - Mo running towards his car.

INT. ZEKE’S CAR - SECONDS LATER

Zeke somehow manages to smoke a cigarette, drive the car,
surf the radio, lecture about nothing, and stuff his face
with half of Mo’s peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Mo
quietly watches.

ZEKE
...It’s like in King Kong when the
monkey has got the chick in his
hand and he is throwing her around.
Yea, she is scared but she is also
super turned on, because- this is
what I am saying - girls like to be
thrown around when you are having
sex. They like somebody that’s
going to pick them up and throw
them up against a wall or on the
bed. Because it makes them feel
small, it makes them feel like you
are a real man, but more
importantly like they are this
fragile little girl.

(realizing his audience)
(MORE )
ZEKE (CONT'D)
With you it will be different
though. I don’t think there are
many girls you can pick up. We’ll
have to figure out your own thing.
Shit where am I going again?

INT. SPORTS BAR - AFTERNOON

Mo and Zeke are with Zeke’s two friends, NICK AND TONY,
watching a football game. Across from them, three pretty
girls are at a different table watching the game, minding
their own business.

Zeke yells to the girls at the next table.

ZEKE
What is this? Junior High?

GIRL
Excuse me?

ZEKE
Boys over here, girls over there, I
feel like we are at an eighth grade
dance or something.

The girls laugh.
ZEKE (CONT’D)
(pointing at his friends)
I'll trade you him and him.
(pointing at the girls)
For her and her.

GIRL
That one looks a little young.

Mo blushes.

NICK
He thinks you look a little old.

CUT TO:

BAR — MOMENTS LATER

The guys and girls are all squeezed at one table screaming at
the game on TV. The older one is sitting on Mo’s lap. The two
friends share a look.
INT. CAR - MORNING

Mo drives his car, alone for the first time. He looks around
the empty car feeling incredibly old. He turns on to a nearby
street and stops.

He is double parked, listening to Bruce Springsteen and
singing along with the music at the top of his lungs. Cars
pull up behind him and honk, he waves them to go around.

Across the street Zeke comes out of his apartment building
and jay walks across the street, pissing off the same
driver's that are trying to get around Mo’s car. He hops in
and Mo pulls out.

ZEKE
I can’t believe it.

MONROE
I’m a real person now.

ZEKE
I didn’t think they gave driver's
licenses to kids who couldn’t reach
the pedals.

MONROE
I have to wear special shoes.

ZEKE
No fucking way.

He tries to bend over and see.

MONROE
I'm kidding you idiot. I can reach
the pedals.

ZEKE
Let me see the thing.

Mo pulls out his wallet and shows him his license.

ZEKE (CONT’D)

(reading)
Monroe Ernest Kaufman. God that’s
unfortunate.

(then)
It is going to be so nice having a
personal chauffeur.
10.

MO
Get that idea out of your head
right now. I am not driving you
around.

ZEKE
Are you kidding me? Do you know how
many years of me driving your sorry
ass around you have to make up for?

MO
I’ve got an hour and a half until I
have to be at school. Where do you
want to go?

ZEKE
I thought your school started at
8:30?

MO
Yeah but the first class is
bullshit.

ZEKE
I’m hungry.

Zeke pulls out a joint from his shirt pocket and lights it.

MO
Not in my new car man.

ZEKE

It’s weed, it smells good. It will
compliment the new car smell.

(He takes a puff)
You should really smoke this, you
might relax a little bit.

(then)
Don’t you have that research paper
for your art class?

MO
Yeah, so?

ZEKE
Well let’s go look at some shit.
(british)
To the museum driver, show me the
meaning of haste.

INT —- CHICAGO INSTITUTE OF ART - DAY

Zeke and Mo walk through the museum.
11.

ZEKE
So what's the assignment?

MO
I’m supposed to pick a painting I
think is important and write about
it.

ZEKE
What about this one?

Zeke points to a painting by Cy Twombly entitled “Leda and
the Swan.”

MO
Looks like a bunch of scribbles and
dicks on a blank canvas to me.

ZEKE
If you boiled life down to it’s
essentials that’s probably all it
would look like too. It’s just a
bunch of disruptive gestures and
violence and explosions...and dicks
and liquids flying around in a
void. Everything else is
superfluous window dressing.

MO
There’s more to life than “liquids
flying around” and dicks and
violence.

ZEKE
Not really, you just think there
is. But if you really want to
represent what’s important, what’s
constant, there it is in front of
you in one immediate experience. If
I asked you to make a picture of
what’s important in life you’d
probably show me an iPhone photo of
your fucking Xbox.

MO
I could make this painting in like
5 minutes dude.

ZEKE
Yeah, yeah, you and everyone’s kid
right? First of all, no you can’t
and the proof of that is that you
didn’t.

(MORE )
12.

ZEKE (CONT'D)
Second of all the world doesn’t
care about what you MIGHT be able
to do if you really put your mind
to it, the world only cares about
what you actually did.

Mo is left staring at the painting, Zeke continues on through
the exhibit.

MO (V.O.)
A dick in space. That’s Zeke. He
shouldn’t be here, he should be in
college.

EXT. ZEKE’S DAD'S HOUSE - FLASHBACK THREE YEARS

A group of kids gathered around Zeke as he throws the last of
his luggage in the car. There is a University of Michigan
flag in his back window. Some girls are crying. Mo is in the
back not saying much, but clearly sad to see his friend go.

Zeke waves one last goodbye and drives off. The crowd
disperses, Mo is the last one staring down the empty street.

MO (V.O.)
He went to the University of
Michigan and was persuaded by some
friends to pledge the fraternity
Sigma Nu.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

Zeke is stripped down to his underwear and blindfolded. A
group of college seniors circle around him, taunting him. One
even pours his beer out on Zeke’s head.

MO (V.O.)
I don’t know a lot about pledging
fraternities, but apparently it is
a very rigorous process, and Zeke
soon realized it wasn’t for him.

Zeke punches the senior standing in front of him, he nails
him square in the face. Backing up, Zeke stumbles into
another boy and finds the beer bottle in his hand. He grabs
it and smashes it over another boy’s head, blood starts
pouring. At this point the surrounding boys descend on him
viciously.

MO (V.O.)
The frat boys were really upset he
didn’t want to keep pledging.
13.

EXT. ZEKE’S DAD’S HOUSE - 2 WEEKS LATER

Zeke’s car comes back down the same road it left only a few
weeks earlier. This time there is no crowd of people in his
driveway. Just Mo standing alone. Zeke get’s out of the car,
his face is black and blue.

MO (V.O.)
One of their dads was the dean and
he got Zeke kicked out. It was all
very political.

INT. ZEKE’S DAD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Mo helps Zeke carry his bags back into the house. In the
living room Zeke’s Dad is drunk and passed out in front of
the television.
MO (V.O.)

Zeke’s Dad seemed pretty cool about

the whole thing.
INT. MUSEUM - PRESENT
Mo gives the painting one last look and goes to catch up with
his friend.
INT. SCHOOL - AN HOUR LATER
Mo walks into the school as the first period is ending. The
hallway is completely empty. The bell rings and students pour
in from everywhere around him. He is in a forest of kids and
he barely comes up their chests. He pushes through, miserable
and unnoticed.
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN TABLE - EVENING

Mo eats with his parents.

REUBEN
How was the first day with the car?

MO
Really good.

REUBEN
How was school?
14.

MO
Good.
(clearing his plate)
I gotta go though.

REUBEN
Where?
MO
I was going to go over to Zeke’s.
REUBEN
It’s a school night.
MO
He is helping me with my homework.
SHERRI
That is so nice of him.
MO
Yeah, he had a lot of these classes
before so...
REUBEN

(not convinced)
Doesn’t he have work tomorrow?

MO
He quit his job.
SHERRI
Why?
MO

They were hiring people above him.
He had to leave...It was all very
political.

SHERRI
So what's he going to do now?

MO
He’s still trying to figure that
out. He said he wants to break into
the art world.

DAD
Why doesn’t he come here and help
you with your homework? We haven't
seen him in ages.
INT.

15.

MO
(halfway out of the room)
Come on, he’s doing me a favor. I
can’t ask him to drive all the way
over.

DAD
Alright.

SHERRI
Well, tell him to come over and see
us every once in a while. We miss

him.
MO
I will.
DAD
And be careful in that car.
MO
I will.
DAD

All it takes is ten seconds of
stupid to ruin your whole life.

MO (0.S.)
(gone)
I know.

ZEKE’S APARTMENT - LATER

CLOSE UP - A quarter landing in a glass of brown liquid.

Rack focus to the boys on the other side of the room.

ZEKE
HOMERUN!!! 1!

TONY
No!

ZEKE

That’s never happened to me before.

MO
Who has to drink that?

ZEKE
You do.
16.

MO
(devastated)
What’s in it.

ZEKE
(blissful)
Whiskey, vodka, Beer, red wine,
Robitusin, Milk duds, Xanax, orange
juice.

NICK
(still holding his eye)
No, he’s going to die. I’1l drink
it for him.

MO
Like hell you will.

ZEKE
He can do it.

He holds the glass up to his face.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Wait I need music for this.

Zeke goes over to the speakers and turns up the music.
Mo closes his eyes and chugs the drink.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
(As Mo chugs)

Okay, this is for Nick. What would
you rather, every time somebody
says your name you jiz in your
pants OR every time you wake up in
the morning Mo punches you as hard
as he can in the face.

Mo finishes the drink.

MO
But I would never do that.

ZEKE
It’s a fictional world. In this
universe you would have no control
over your body.

NICK
Can I change my name?

ZEKE
No.
17.

NICK
Momo punch me as hard you can in
the arm right now.

The boys laugh.
MO
It would be much more painful in
your face- Woah I feel weird.
NICK
I know I just want to get a sense
of what I’m working with.

MO
It would hurt, I promise.

They look at him skeptically.

NICK
I‘1ll take getting punched by the
kid.

MO

Fuck you, let me punch you, let me
show you what you’re in for.

ZEKE
Okay enough of this it’s my turn.

Mo punches Nick right in the face. Everybody is stunned
silent. Then Nick starts cracking up.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
What the hell are you doing?

MO
I don’t know I’m sorry. I wanted
you to see I could punch.

ZEKE
Nick can he punch?

NICK
I’1l live.

MO

Yeah but it hurt right.
Mo collapses on the ground.

FADE OUT.
18.

INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

All around him kids are socializing, gathered in little
clumps around the room. He sits alone at his desk with a
terrible hangover.

MO’S POV - SOPHIE WILLITS sitting on her desk, talking to a
group of her girlfriends. She looks over to Monroe, he smiles
and then looks away quickly.

A boy, JON EPSTEIN, comes up to Mo’s desk.

EPSTEIN
Monroe, what’s up man?

MO
Hey Epstein.

EPSTEIN
How do you always get away with
skipping first period? It’s
incredible.

MO
I don’t know.

Mo just wants to look at Sophie in peace.

EPSTEIN
I’m serious, every time I skip a
class I have so many people
crawling up my ass.

MO
I don’t know- My friend told me
once, if they don’t notice you when
you're there, they won’t notice
when you aren’t.

EPSTEIN
You’re a legend.

Mo shrugs at the compliment.

EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
Are you okay?

MO
I’m a little hungover.

EPSTEIN
But it’s Wednesday.

Mo shrugs again.
19.

EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
(under his breath)
Incredible.

Mo goes back to staring at Sophie.
Epstein follows Mo’s eyeline across the room.

EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
Sophie Willits?

MO
What? No?

EPSTEIN

Hey hey, don’t get defensive. She
is hot. Ya know what...

(moving in closer and

whispering)
Paul’s parents are going out of
town this weekend and we are
throwing a rager at his house.
Guarantee Sophie will be there.

MO
Really?

EPSTEIN
What you think I’m lying?

MO
Did Paul say I could come?

EPSTEIN
Don’t worry about Paul. I can
invite anybody I want. I have carte
blanche.

MO
Okay cool, yeah I’1l come.

Sophie looks back over at Mo and smiles. Epstein sees this
exchange.

EPSTEIN
Oh my god it’s so fucking on.

Epstein goes back to his desk but remembers something.

EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
It’s a pimps and ho’s party.

MO
What does that mean?
EPSTEIN
Guys dress like pimps girls dress
like Hos.

MO
What does a pimp wear?

EPSTEIN
I don’t know, robes and chains and
shit.

MO
Alright cool.

EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - AFTERNOON

Mo is at Baseball practice. He is standing at the plate. He
swings hard but misses every time, striking out. He walks

away from the plate defeated.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

Mo is in the back changing out of his baseball gear. A few of
the bigger, more senior players are gathered around nearby.
The ringleaders seem to be DANNY AND JOSH. Mo can’t help but

overhear they are talking about Paul's party.

MO
Hey are you guys talking about
Paul’s party?

DANNY
(caught off guard)
What? No- It’s just, it’s like a
birthday thing.

JOSH
It’s going to be super low key.
Just like some close friends and
stuff.

MO
No, it’s cool, Epstein invited me.

JOSH
Oh really?

MO
Yeah, Pimps and Ho’s party right?

DANNY
Yeah. Epstein invited you?
21.

Mo packs his stuff up and heads out.

MO
Yup. See you there.

The boys shrug at each other, confused at what just happened.

DANNY
Epstein is going rogue.

JOSH
Seriously.
INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
CLOSE UP - fighter jets flying through the air.

Widen to reveal the boys are watching Top Gun.

ZEKE
What do you mean? Your parents love
me.

MO

I know they do. You just have to go
over there and re-up the charm.
Just a little face time every few
months to keep them happy. You put
on a nice shirt. Maybe watch a
little football with my Dad. And
they’re off my case.

ZEKE
Holly, what do you think of this?

We see on the other side of the room Zeke’s girlfriend HOLLY
MCCARTNEY is doing work on a laptop.

HOLLY
I think if I had a kid that spent
this much time with you, I would be
much more concerned than Mo's
parents are.

Zeke sparks a bong and takes a big hit.

ZEKE
Hey what the hell. I didn’t ask Mo
to come over he just kept showing
up.

MO
Fuck you man, I’ll leave right now.
22.

ZEKE
Sit down I’m kidding.

He shakes his head at Holly like he isn’t kidding. Then he
passes her the bong. Mo watches as Holly smokes it.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Stop giving Holly the creepy eyes.

MO
(mortified)
I was not- what? Creepy eyes?

ZEKE
She's not a piece of a meat Momo.

MO
(changing the subject)
I wasn’t- I- I got invited to a
party.

ZEKE
Atta boy. Way to pull your weight
around here. Where are we going?

MO
You aren't invited.

ZEKE
What are you talking about?

MO
It’s a high school party, you don’t
want to come.

ZEKE
Like hell I don’t.
HOLLY
Let him make some friends his own

age.
She passes the bong to Mo but he shakes his head.
ZEKE
(intercepting the bong)
He doesn’t smoke.

HOLLY
Really? How old are you?

MO
It’s not that-
23.

ZEKE
Momo gets a little scared when he’s
high.

MO

-I just don’t like it.

HOLLY
Do your friends smoke?

Mo looks at Zeke sitting next to him, ripping the bong.

MO
Hmmm.

HOLLY
I meant your high school friends.

MO
I don’t need High School friends,
I’ve got these guys.

ZEKE
(seeing through this)
That’s a terrible attitude. What if
something happens to me? Or even
more likely, what if I get bored of
you?

HOLLY
Zeke.

ZEKE
He knows I’m kidding.

He shakes his head at Mo like he isn’t kidding.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
So what are you going to do when
you go to this party and everybody
is getting high and you are sitting
in the corner with your dick in
your hand.

MO
I’m not going to have my-

ZEKE
I mean they already think you are a
pussy.

MO

They don’t think-
24.

ZEKE
I’ve got it! You are going to bring
weed to the party.

MO
What? No.

ZEKE
Yes. You show up at that house and
you have all the party favors. You
are the coolest motherfucker in the
room.

MO
No thanks.

ZEKE
I’m serious. Holly tell him this is
a good idea. I have a ton of weed,
I‘’1l give you a bunch to take to
the party. You sell it to your
friends. A) You are the man B) We
make money.

Mo looks to Holly.

HOLLY
I’m not touching this.

MO
I don’t know-

ZEKE
Just hold on.

Zeke runs into his room and comes out with six pill bottles
filled with weed.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Look, I’ve got six of these things.
You sell each one for a hundred
bucks. Your done. We’ll split it
down the middle.

MO
I don’t want to be that guy showing
up at the party with six bottles
full of weed.

ZEKE
That's like saying, I don’t want to
be that guy everybody thinks is
awesome. That’s like I don’t want
to be that guy girls want to fuck.
(MORE )
ZEKE (CONT'D)
I mean let’s be honest you already
have a bit of a noticeablity
problem. It’s hard to miss the guy
with the drugs.

MO
You think I am going to walk into a
party and everybody is going to
just want to buy pot from me?

Zeke looks at Holly for a response.

HOLLY
He’s an asshole but he’s right
about that.

Mo’s cell phone rings.

MO
Shut up it’s my Mom.
(he answers the phone)
Hi. Oh sorry, I forgot, I’m coming
home right now.
(he hangs up)
I forgot to take my shot.

ZEKE
Bad boy.

HOLLY
Are you diabetic or something?

MO
No it’s not like that.

ZEKE
He’s juicing. Getting ready for the
big leagues.

MO
I am growth hormone deficient.

HOLLY
You aren’t that short. Like you
aren’t a midgit.

ZEKE
He’s my mini me.

HOLLY
There was a guy I used to go to
summer camp with, he had to do that
shot thing too- he was way shorter
than you.

(MORE )

25.
26.

HOLLY (CONT'D)
But it like had a weird reaction,
he never grew any taller, but his
you-know-what got huge. Like really
big.

Her eyes move down his body, he turns bright red.

ZEKE
Mo
MO
(snapping out of it)
Yeah?
ZEKE

Take the weed.

MO
Fine give it to me.

Monroe takes the bottles. And leaves.
ZEKE
You seemed to know mister summer
camp pretty well...
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - FRONT DOOR
Mo walks in to find his Mom waiting up for him.

MO
You didn’t need to wait up.

SHERRI
My baby boy can drive a car, I
don’t think I am ever going to
sleep again.

He laughs.

MO
Did you make it?

SHERRI
Yeah it’s in the kitchen.

MO
Goodnight.
27.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN TABLE - CONTINUOUS

The kitchen table which has been completely cleaned off since
dinner has a small syringe and an alcohol swab resting at the
head of the table.

Mo stands in front of his shot, he looks down at his dick.
EXT - PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We follow Mo into the house. He is wearing a long white
shower robe over his regular clothes and some cheap holloween
jewlery.

As he walks into the house there is a giant handmade sign
that reads “Pimps and Hos” in big happy bubble letters as if
it actually said Happy Birthday Grandma.

The guys are all wearing robes or long jackets. The girls are
all in basically nothing.

CUT TO Mo getting a beer, unsure of himself.

CUT TO Mo staring at Sophie, she is the only girl who isn’t
dressed like a playboy bunny.

Mo narrates over shots of kids socializing, he tries to seem
like he belongs there.

MO (V.O.)
The theme party has been around
since before Zeke was in high
school and its actually a pretty
ingenious idea. Most kids can’t get
into bars yet, so we have to do all
our serious drinking in basements.
Normally it’s the same basement,
drinking the same cheap vodka with
the same kids night after night can
get a bit repetitive. So you give
each party a theme. Everybody puts
on a costume, and boom, new party
every night. It also has a very
important added bonus. Girls love a
good reason not to wear anything.
So you give the party a theme with
the word ho in it, the girls show
up half naked and half your job is
done for you.

Back to Mo's POV of Sophie.
28.

MO (V.O.)
Though I had no idea how to
complete that job.
He starts to walk over to her until Epstein, wasted,
intercepts him. Epstein is really going for it, big floppy
hat, a cane, a long multicolored coat, a fake moustache.

EPSTEIN
You made it dude.

Watching Sophie walk away.

MO
Yep, I’m here.

EPSTEIN
You got a drink?

Mo holds up his drink.

EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
Isn't this shit the best man.

MO
Yeah it’s pretty good.

EPSTEIN
Have you seen Sophie yet?

Playing dumb

MO
What? No, I don’t know-no. Is she
here?

EPSTEIN

Dude that girl is a ten. A ten.

MO
Cool ya-sure.

EPSTEIN
See that girl over there.

POV - some random wasted girl falling on her ass.

MO
Ya.

EPSTEIN
She's so fucking hot right?
29.

MO
She’s okay.

EPSTEIN
Yeah she’s okay, whatever. I could
probably do better. I’1l see you
man.

Epstein starts to walk away then Mo remembers something.

MO
Eppy wait.

He turns around.

MO (CONT'D)
I brought some drugs for you and
the guys. It’s cool if you don’t
want- I just thought- it’s stupid.
Nevermind-

EPSTEIN
(the music is too loud)
What?

MO
(Louder )
I brought Marijuana.

CUT TO:

A BATHROOM IN THE HOUSE

A group of sixteen year old “pimps” huddle around Mo as he
lays the bottles of weed on the sink.

EPSTEIN
Mo, you are a god damn legend.

MO
Do you want it all?

DANNY
Yeah we fucking want it all.

EPSTEIN
Dude. How much you want for it.

MO
(unsure of himself)
What about six hundred dollars. I
understand if that’s too much I
guess-—
30.

JOSH
You are the fucking man.

Instantly the guys start pulling out wads of cash and
throwing them at a shocked Mo.

EPSTEIN
Did I not tell you this kid is one
of us, this kid is a ten.

The boys cough up a large wad of cash and he stuff it in his
giant robe pocket.

DANNY
You gonna hang and smoke with us?

MO
(these are not his people)
Nah I’m already pretty baked, this
stuff is real strong.

RANDOM PIMP
Legend.

BACK IN THE PARTY

Monroe stands with a group of guys. He still feels out of
place. Across the room Sophie stands with a group of girls.

Mo summons some courage and yells to the group of girls.

MO
What is this junior high?

GIRL
What?

The guys stop their conversation and look at him.

MO
I’m just saying. All you girls over
there and we’re over here, it kind
of feels like an eighth grade
dance.

Sophie laughs, nobody else does.
MO (CONT'D)
(pointing at the two guys
he’s with)
I‘1l trade you him and him for her.

He points at Sophie.
31.

GUY
Hey fuck you man.

OTHER GUY
Is this kid for real right now?

Sophie laughs and walks over to him. He leaves his group.

She looks

SOPHIE
I don’t think they got your joke.
MO
That’s alright.
SOPHIE
I didn’t know you were friends with
them.
MO
Who?
SOPHIE
Anybody.
MO
I have friends.
SOPHIE
Okay.
MO

Most of them are older.

SOPHIE
Like your parents?

MO
You are hilarious.

at the name sewn into his robe.

SOPHIE
Who is Reuben?

MO
Just some pimp I know, let me
borrow his robe, no biggie.

SOPHIE
Reuben is your Dad.

MO
Reuben is my Dad.
32.

SOPHIE
Does he know you stole his robe?

MO
He has twenty, it’s the only thing
he’1l wear to work.

She laughs.
The music changes - LCD SOUNDSYSTEM - SOMEONE GREAT
A girl grabs Sophie and pulls her away.

SOPHIE
Does you being here mean I am going
to be seeing more of you?

MO
I really hope so.

She smiles and walks away.

We follow our hero through the sea of pimps and ho’s out the
door of the house, past the kids smoking cigarettes on the
front stoop. Past Paul freaking out that his parents are
going to kill him. Past a kid throwing up in the bushes. He
get's into his car and drives away.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GROCERY STORE - LATER

Zeke and Mo walk down the aisles of a grocery store. Mo
pushes the cart, Zeke reads from a list and tosses stuff in
the cart as they walk.

ZEKE
(reading)
Pea Shoots? What the fuck are pea
shoots?

MO
It ended up being way easier than I
thought it would be.

ZEKE
Breaking News: kids like drugs.
(To another customer in
the aisle)
Excuse me do you know what Pea
Shoots are?

She shakes her head.
33.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
(sotto to himself)
God dammit Holly.

MO
I know. I just didn’t think they
would want to pay that much.

ZEKE
Seventeen-year-olds don’t know how
much shit costs. And the rich ones
that go to your school don’t really
care. Do you think it’s in the
produce section?

MO
Just ask somebody.

ZEKE
I just did.

MO
That was a civilian. Ask somebody
who works here.

They spot a clerk.

ZEKE
Excuse me sir. I’m looking for Pea
Shoots, do you know what those, or
that, or whatever it is might be?

CLERK
Pea Shoots? Is that a vegetable?

ZEKE
I don’t know man. My girlfriend is
cooking dinner and she just gave me
this list of stuff.

CLERK
I’m guessing that would be in
produce.

MO

Sophie was there too.
The clerk yells to another employee.
CLERK

Hey Mike, you know what Pea Shoots
are?
34.

MIKE
Pea Shoots?

ZEKE
(mostly to himself)
This girl I swear to god, it can
never be like, go get milk, or go
get salt. It has to be I need
Harrissa Paste. Like that’s even a
fucking thing.

MO
Did you hear what I said? Sophie
was there.

ZEKE
One thing at a time buddy.

MO
She looked hot too.

ZEKE
Which one is that?

MO
I told you about Sophie.

MIKE
I don’t think we have any Pea
Shoots boss.

ZEKE
Alright, I don’t know is there an
equivalent? Should I just get
regular peas?

MO
Don’t look at me. What’s next on
the list?

ZEKE
(reading)
Fish Sauce?

CLERK
You mean like cocktail sauce.

ZEKE
I’m going to kill her.

MO
We also need wine she said.
35.

ZEKE’S APARTMENT

Mo, Zeke and Holly sit at the table eating dinner. There is a
wad of cash off to the side. They are seated the same way he
sits with his parents, Zeke and Holly on either end, Mo in
the middle. It looks like a bizzaro family dinner. Holly
reads the wine label.

HOLLY
Chateau Diana?

ZEKE
It was only three dollars, we got
six bottles!

HOLLY
You just made like six hundered
dollars.
ZEKE
That’s all being invested.
MO
This is really good Holly.
HOLLY
Thanks.
ZEKE

She's the best cook in the god damn
world. What'd you expect?

HOLLY
Thank you boys for doing the
shopping.
ZEKE
Mo’s got a crush on a girl.
HOLLY
Who?
MO
Her name’s Sophie. She’s
incredible.
HOLLY
Uch that is so sweet. Does she like
you?
ZEKE

Of course she likes him. What’s not
to like?
36.

MO
You think?

ZEKE
You're a sixteen year old high
school drug dealer with a growth
deficiency. I can’t think of
anything more likable.

MO
You forgot virgin.

ZEKE
(to Holly)
See what I’m saying, he’s self
deprecating too! I’m thinking about
fucking him.

MO
I don’t know.

ZEKE
Alright this is what you do. Give
her a lot of attention. Call her
just to say hi and bullshit. Just
lay it on real thick.

MO
Won't she get annoyed?

ZEKE
Just listen to me. Do that for like
three or four weeks. A lot of
attention, she loves it, you are
funny. Maybe she just thinks of you
as a friend and doesn’t plan on
hooking up with you. But if this
girl is as hot as you say she is
than she knows you want to fuck
her, and she loves the attention.
Then after a few days, freeze her
out.

MO
What do you mean?

ZEKE
Give her nothing. Radio silence.

HOLLY
This is disgusting.
37.

ZEKE
Hol I’m sorry baby, but if you
don’t like seeing how the sausage
is made then don’t eat it.

She is mortified.

MO
Finish.

ZEKE
Where was I?

MO
Freeze her out.

ZEKE
That’s right, give her nothing. She
will go nuts wondering what she did
wrong. Why you aren’t interested in
her anymore. This girl who is so
used to getting attention from
every guy suddenly has no idea why
she just lost her biggest customer.
She will think about you night and
day and not know why. After a week
or two of silence. That’s when you
make your move. She will be so
confused and desperate, she'll fuck
you the first night.

HOLLY
I can’t listen to this.

She takes her plate to the kitchen.

ZEKE
Did I give him bad advice?
HOLLY
(yelling from the other

room)
No, it’s great advice, and it will
definitely work. But I am just
saying you use these tricks because
you are a dick. Maybe Mo can just
be himself and girls will like him
because he’s such a great guy.

ZEKE
(calling to Holly)
No you're probably right, Holly.

Zeke shoots Mo a look that says, “fuck that freeze her out.”
38.

Holly comes back and rejoins this fucked up family portrait.

INT. MONROE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

He is on the phone, waiting for somebody to pick up on the
other end.

SOPHIE (V.O.)

Hello?

MO
Sophie?

SOPHIE
Yeah.

MO
It’s Mo.

SOPHIE
Hi.

MO
From school.

SOPHIE
I know.

MO
Okay cool.

SOPHIE
What’s up?

MO
Not a lot. What’s up with you?

SOPHIE
Did you just call to say hi?

MO
I did.

SOPHIE

Oh, cool. Hi.

MO
What are you doing?

SOPHIE
Watching TV.
39.

MO
Nice.

SOPHIE
Yep.

More silence.

SOPHIE (CONT'D)
You are like the first person to
call me just to say hi since I was
in the eighth grade.

MO
(teasing)
Now who’s the one with no friends.

SOPHIE
I have friends, most of them just
text me.
MO
Oh, sure. Texting would have been a
good idea.
SOPHIE
Yeah, there are fewer awkward
silences.
Long silence.
SHERRI
Mo.
MO
Mom??

Reveal Mom in the kitchen on the other line.

SHERRI
Your shot is ready.
MO
Okay.
SHERRI
Who are you talking to?
MO
I get what you were saying about
texting.
SOPHIE

Yeah.
40.

SHERRI
Is that a girl?

MO
Mom.

SHERRI

Sorry, I’m going.
She hangs up.

SOPHIE
Your shot?

MO
Me and my parents do tequila shots
after dinner. It’s a tradition.

SOPHIE
Woah.

MO
Yeah, we get pretty turnt up. I'll
talk to you later.

SOPHIE
Maybe you-

MO
I will text you later.

SOPHIE
There ya go.
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN TABLE

CLOSE UP - The needle going in, he pushes the syringe,
injecting himself with growth hormone.

CLOSE UP - He drops the used syringe in a transparent orange
medical container with hundreds of his other used shots.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Mo walks down the hall. Instead of pushing his way through
the usual sea of bodies, some people see him and nod their
head in silent recognition. He see’s Sophie and waves. She
smiles back but he is quickly flanked by Epstein.

EPSTEIN
Mo. My man.
41.

MO
Hey Eppy.
EPSTEIN
You have a good time at that party?
MO
Yeah it was fun.
EPSTEIN
It was fucking epic. That party was
a ten.
MO
Okay.
EPSTEIN

We’re gonna do it again. Leo
Mcnally’s Mom and Dad are taking
his sister to look at colleges next
weekend.

MO
And he is dumb enough to let you
throw a party in his house?

EPSTEIN
He’s a team player. It’s for the
good of the homies. We’re all out
there trying to have fun, trying to
get our dicks a little wet. If
there were more people like Leo and
Paul out there, this world would be
a better place.

MO
You should run for President.

EPSTEIN
Listen man. We really want you to
come.

MO
I want to-

EPSTEIN
And it would be really cool if you
could bring supplies like you did
last time.

MO
Yeah, that shouldn’t be a-
42.

EPSTEIN
But we were talking, and weed is
cool if its a few guys hanging in
the backyard on a Wednesday jerking
off-

MO
That’s a thing?-

EPSTEIN
-but we are trying to blow the
walls off you know?

MO
No.

EPSTEIN
So we were thinking maybe instead
of weed, is there any way you could
score some coke?

MO
Coke? Like cocaine?

EPSTEIN
Yeah man. It’s cool if you can’t. I
just thought I would ask since you
obviously have some kind of hook
up.

MO
(trying to keep his
composure )
Let me look into it.

EPSTEIN
I mean, you know these dudes have
cash. I am sure you would be well
taken care of.

MO
(afraid to ask)
If I can’t get that stuff. Can I
still come to the party?

EPSTEIN
Yeah man, of course. How could you
even ask a question like that?

MO
Okay okay. I’1l see what I can do.

EPSTEIN
Yes, you are the man.
43.

Epstein walks away.

Mo is left alone, a few guys walking by wave hi to him.

EXT. BATTING CAGES - AFTERNOON
CLOSE UP - A baseball bat crushing an incoming pitch.

Zeke stands at the plate hitting balls and eating a popsicle.
Monroe is next to him against the cage, he doesn’t hit but he
is wearing a helmet. Nick and Tony are there as well.

ZEKE
How much do they want?

MO
I guess as much as we can get ‘em.

ZEKE
Nick what do you think?

NICK
I mean we can get it. That’s not
the problem.

TONY
Can I bat?

ZEKE
Do these kids have the money?

MO
Yes.

ZEKE
I don’t want us buying all this
shit and you coming back with a
bunch of seventeen year old IOUs.

MO
What do I look like to you?

NICK
Maybe you should go with him to the
party.

TONY
It’s my turn you’ve already had
like nine extra swings.

ZEKE
Nah...I’m not going to the party.
44.
NICK
Why not.

TONY
Zeke.

Zeke starts chucking balls at Tony.

ZEKE

Would you shut the fuck up for five
seconds while we figure this out.

(then to Nick)
I’m not going to the party because
Mo is a minor. If the cops come
bust this thing up he’s just like
everybody else. They call his
parents and give him detention.

He takes another swing.

ZEKE (CONT’D)

I’m twenty three, I can’t be seen
at this party and I can’t be the
face of this whole thing.

MO
Well I don’t want to be the face of
this whole thing.

Zeke hands him the bat.

TONY
Bullshit it’s my turn.

ZEKE
Monroe.

MO
Yeah?

ZEKE

Hit the ball.

Mo swings and misses it.

ZEKE (CONT’D)

No no no, you are doing it all
wrong. You have to use your height
to your advantage. If you bend down
lower you will have no strike zone,
they will walk you every time.

Mo squats down, his elbows and knees are practically

touching.
45.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Perfect.

NICK
He’s in a cage for fuck’s sake, he
can’t strike out.

INT. MO’S CAR - NIGHT

Mo and Zeke drive home from the batting cages.

The car turns.

ZEKE
Where are you going?

MO
My sister's.

ZEKE
What. No. No. Why? No.

MO
I told her since we were going to
be on the west side I’d come say

hi.
ZEKE
This is an ambush.
MO
No it isn’t, I told you I had to do
this.
ZEKE

Does she know I’m with you?

MO
She must assume, I said I was going
to the cages with you.

ZEKE
Did she sound like she wanted to
see me?

MO

I can’t even express the joy it
gives me to see you flustered like
this.
46.

The car pulls up in front of a chic mid-century modern one
level house. The front wall is one massive glass window and
you can see right inside.

ZEKE
I am not going to wait in the car
like an asshole.

MO
Okay then come say hi.

ZEKE
I don’t want to talk to her prick
boyfriend. I don’t need to hear how
awesome he is doing and how cool
his art collection is.

MO
He’s not like that at all. He’s
nice.

ZEKE

He’s a dick.
Mo get’s out of the car.

MO
Fine then stay here I don’t give a
shit.

Zeke thinks about it for a second then ultimately decides
it’s much weirder to wait in the car.

INT/EXT. KATE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Kate’s boyfriend Doug answers the door. He is extremely
handsome and seems genuinely excited to see both of them.

DOUG
Hey guys!

Zeke walks in behind Mo.

DOUG (CONT'D)
(super nice)
Zeke, man. How’s it going?

ZEKE
(like an asshole)
Fine.

DOUG
Dude I have been telling everybody
at work about you.

(MORE )
47.

DOUG (CONT'D)
They always give me shit that my
girlfriend's ex knows more about
art than I do, but I love it. I
think you have to come work with us
as a consultant.

ZEKE
I'm pretty busy right now ya know.
Lot of irons in the fire and such.
Lot of balls in the air.

DOUG
No worries, I won’t twist your arm.

Kate comes out of the bedroom.

KATE
Mo Mo. This is so sweet.

As she goes to hug Mo she notices Zeke standing behind him
and her expression changes. Zeke smiles. She get’s flustered.
He was her first love, and that doesn’t go away.

MO
You think I’d come all the way
across town and not say hi?

KATE
You didn’t say you were bringing
your babysitter.

ZEKE
Ouch, well the kid needed a good
role model and I didn’t see anybody
else stepping up to the plate.

She fake punches him in the arm.

DOUG
(oblivious)
Look at you two with that same old
banter. I love it!

MO
We are just coming from the batting
cages over on Division.

DOUG
You should have told me, I love
that spot.

Zeke seethes with rage.
48.

DOUG (CONT'D)
You guys want something to drink?

MO
Sure.
ZEKE
Don’t you have homework Mo?
MO
Yeah- but.
DOUG

He’s right. You should do that.

KATE
(She can’t help it)
Oh relax, one beer.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LATER

The four of them have been drinking and joking around for a
while, Zeke looks uncomfortable.

DOUG
(to Zeke and Mo)
I think it’s really awesome that
you two have managed to stay so
close even after Katie and you
broke up.

ZEKE
I needed the intern. He wasn’t my
first choice, but the climate out
there is rough.

MO
Fuck you.

ZEKE
Alright, I think we should hit it.

KATE
No stay. You just got here.

DOUG
You guys should come over for
dinner next week. A real visit,
none of this pop-in stuff.
49.

ZEKE
Alright, well bye.

DOUG
See ya later.

The boys walk out.

DOUG (CONT'D)
I really like that guy.

INT. MO’S CAR - SAME TIME

ZEKE
He is the biggest piece of shit
I've ever met in my life.

Mo turns the car on and tries to back out of the driveway.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
(to himself)
God your sister is so hot.
(to Mo)
Let me tell you something. Once you
sleep with somebody once, it
doesn’t matter who they are. You
can go fifty years without seeing
them- It’s like having a key or a-

MO
I’m sorry, I wasn’t paying
attention Did you sleep with a
fifty year old?

ZEKE
I have, but that’s not what I’m-
What’s wrong?

MO
The drug stuff. It just seems like
a lot ya know. Weed was one thing.
Coke just feels like a darker
territory.

ZEKE
It’s not like that at all man. It’s
just another thing. It’s not worse.
It’s a lateral move.
50.

INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM - A FEW NIGHTS LATER

Monroe’s POV - He watches out of his front window as a car
drives up and stops in front of the mailbox, Nick rolls down
the window puts a package inside and drives off with Tony in
the passenger seat. They wave at Mo in his window.

EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE

Mo walks down the driveway to the mailbox.

INT. REUBEN’S STUDY

He finds his Father's briefcase, opens it, and empty’s the
stack of papers onto the desk. He leaves with the empty
briefcase.

CLOSE UP - Tightening the knot of his tie
C1OSE UP - Putting on a black suit jacket.

INSERT - Putting several bags of coke into the empty
briefcase, and closing it to reveal his father’s monogram
embossed across the top.

EXT - LEO’S HOUSE

We track behind our hero in his suit and tie while he carries
his briefcase full of cocaine into the party. He looks like a
real badass and feels like one too.

We follow him into the house where he passes under a banner
that says “CEO’s and CORPORATE HOs”. It soon becomes clear
that everybody else is wearing a suit and carrying a
breifcase. Except for the girls who are wearing large white
dress shirts and little else.

INT. BATHROOM

We pan across the small bathroom as eight or ten kids in
black suits snort coke off of every available surface. At the
end of our pan we land on our boy, who is sitting on the sink

counting the money.

MATCH CUT TO:

ZEKE’S APARTMENT - DINNER TABLE

Zeke is counting the money at the table while Holly brings
out the food for another delicious meal she cooked.
51.

Monroe pops the cork on a very expensive bottle of champagne
and almost falls over from the force.

KAUFMAN HOUSE - DINNER TABLE - ANOTHER NIGHT

Zeke sits next to Mo, he is wearing a nice shirt and has
cleaned himself up. Sherri brings a delicious meal to the
table.

FAMILY ROOM - LATER

Zeke and Reuben are watching football together. Mo is
thrilled.

MO’S MAILBOX
He pulls out another package
PARTY

We follow him under a sign that reads “GOLF PROS AND TENNIS
HOs” he is dressed accordingly.

A bunch of young golf pros snorting coke and smoking pot. And
having the best time. One kid is throwing up, another two are
making out..Mo is standing behind Sophie with his arms
wrapped around her, pretending to show her how to swing a
tennis racket. The top 40 music swells.

OFFICE DEPOT

Zeke is in uniform at his job, working late. He is in a red
vest and a name tag that says “ISAAC” which he couldn’t hate
more. He speaks to an older woman.

CUSTOMER
I'm looking for a printer.

Without looking at her he points to a giant xerox machine.

ZEKE
How about that one?
CUSTOMER
That seems like a lot, it’s for my

home.
He points to a small printer.

ZEKE
How about that one?
52.

CUSTOMER
Does this do color or just black
and white.

ZEKE

Ma’am this ain’t the fifties, all
printers are color.

He reads the label.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Fuck me, it’s black and white.
You'd think they’d have that
figured out by now.

He get’s a text.
CLOSE UP - TEXT FROM MO: $$$$

ZEKE (CONT’D)
You know what Ma’am, you are going
to have to speak to somebody who
works here. Because that sure as
shit aint me anymore.

He takes off his nametag and sticks it in a display shredder
on his way out the door but the shredder makes a loud jamming
sound and smokes up. He also grabs a box of pens because fuck
them.

INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

Mo sits in front of three guys. His Father’s briefcase is
open and filled with little bags of weed, coke, and other
pills. He talks fast and does math in his head.

MO
Alright that’s two grams of the
diesel. Plus how many bags of coke
was that one or two? Just give me
180 for the whole thing.

GUY
180?

MO
You are getting a great deal! Trust
me. This is my best shit. Fine, how
about this. I’1l throw in a bar of
xanax, but now you are literally
robbing me.
53.

OTHER GUY
What is your best weed?

MO
I mean that really depends on what
kind of high you want. For a
relaxed body high I would take
this. For more of a head slash mind
high, this is your best bet.

OTHER GUY
Can I do a mix?

MO
Yeah, I can do that. One bag of
each is gonna be 80.

ANOTHER GUY
Is this plus the coke going to get
me fucked up?

MO
(is this guy an idiot?)
Big time.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. J CREW STORE - DAY

The boys walk thru the store together. Mo comes out holding
up a black leather jacket.

MO
What about this?

ZEKE
You can afford it.

MO
It’s like a ninja coat.

ZEKE
(to salesgirl)
Do you have the ninja coat in child
sizes?

INT. SCHOOL - DAY

Mo walks through the halls. New clothes, new haircut, new
attitude. He is cool as shit. The kids seem to get out of his
way. Some say hi, some don’t, but everybody knows he’s there.
At the other end of the hall Sophie is waiting for him.
54.

INT. PARTY - NIGHT

Danny, Josh and Mo are talking while Epstein breaks up lines
of coke.

JOSH
God look at this, we have
absolutely no hot girls at our
school.

DANNY
What are you talking about?
Jessica, Ramona, Sophie, Tess-—

JOSH
No I’m talking about the girls like
when we were Freshman. The seniors
then, those girls were out of
control.

DANNY
True.

JOSH
Like remember Holly McCartney?

DANNY
Oh my god I fucking loved her.

Mo perks up.

MO
Ya know I’m good friends with her.

DANNY
What are you talking about?

MO
She dates my best friend.

JOSH
That makes me so sad.

DANNY
Is she still incredible?

MO
Yeah, she’s pretty great.

He sees Sophie on the other side of the room.

MO (CONT'D)
I’m gonna go do a lap.
55.

Mo walks towards Sophie.

DANNY
Yeah we are too.

Danny and Josh leave Epstein alone with his pile of coke.

EPSTEIN
(to nobody)
Hey is nobody going to do this? I
don’t like to leave food on the
table, guys.

Angle back on Mo, catching up with Sophie.

SOPHIE
(teasing)
I thought your only friends were
older and more sophisticated.

INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT - LATER
Nick, Tony, Zeke and Holly are playing Beer Baseball.

NICK
Alright Zeke. Would you rather have
all of the hair on your body be
silly string, or denim?

ZEKE
Denim? What would that even look
like? It doesn’t matter you are
asking the wrong guy, Tony’s the
one with the hairy chest.

TONY
What kind of denim is it?

NICK
Like some Diesel faded design shit.

TONY
Silly string.

HOLLY
Would you rather get raped by 10
guys at once and nobody ever finds
out, or the whole world thinks you
got gang banged by the entire New
York Jets. But you didn’t actually
do it.

NICK
That just got so real.
56.

At that moment Mo appears in the doorway of the apartment
with Sophie.

MO
I’m sorry. Are we interrupting
something?

The group seems totally caught of guard. And shocked at how
pretty Sophie is.

NICK
Fresh blood.

ZEKE
Don’t be weird Nick.

SOPHIE
(To Mo)
So this is your secret clubhouse.

ZEKE
I hope you blindfolded her on the
way here. We can’t have the
location getting out.

DISSOLVE TO:

ZEKE’S APARTMENT - LATER

Everybody is much drunker. The music is much louder. They all
have forty ounce bottles of beer duct taped to their hands.
Zeke and Nick are wrestling. Tony is in the bathroom trying
to figure out how to pee. Sophie is picking out music on the
ipod. Mo and Holly sit on the couch observing everything.

HOLLY
Sophie is adorable.

MO
Yeah, thanks. So is Zeke. I mean-
You know what I mean.

Holly laughs. Sophie finally picks a song she likes and pulls
Mo to his feet. The dance, awkwardly, since they have no use
of their hands it’s just a lot of rubbing hips. Holly watches
the way Mo looks at Sophie. This is the most confident he’s
ever looked.

Sophie throws her hands up in the air, her bottles are empty.

SOPHIE
Finished!
ZEKE
Wow.

57.

Tony runs out of the bathroom, he appears to have pissed his

pants.

TONY
How is that possible?

NICK
(privately)
Where did you find this girl, Momo?

MO
High school, Nick. I found her in
high school.

ZEKE
Alright I’ve got to put a tent on
this circus. It’s bed time.

MO
We can’t drive.

ZEKE
Holly will you call the children a
cab? Mo I’m sure you have plenty of
cash to pay for it.

TONY
Can I sleep here?

ZEKE
Where are you going to sleep? Nick
is already on the couch.

TONY
I'll crash on the floor. Just give
me a pillow.

ZEKE
Here take this.

He pulls out his old football helmet and gives it to

ZEKE (CONT’D)
It’s got extra padding. Way better
than a pillow.

Tony puts the helmet on and falls to the floor.

Tony.
58.

TONY (0.C.)
This’1l work.

CUT TO:

INT. TAXI - LATER
Mo and Sophie sit in the back of the cab.

SOPHIE
It’s cute to see the way you look
at those guys.

MO
Who, them?

SOPHIE
Yeah, you love them.

MO
I don’t love them. Zeke is like my
older brother.

SOPHIE
Well they love you. And I think
it’s sweet.

She scoots over to the middle seat so they are sitting right
next to each other.

MO
Well I’m glad you had fun.

Mo smiles. She smiles. They kiss.

FADE OUT:

INT. ART GALLERY - DAY

We pull out from the darkness and widen to reveal Zeke and Mo
standing in front of a massive black canvas. They are looking
at a Richard Serra piece, the canvas is so big that the boys
seem miniature standing in front of it.

INT. ART GALLERY - AUCTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A large white room with black folding chairs. On the far side
of the room there is a row of attractive “gallery girls”, all
of them placing bids for collectors over the phone.

Angle on Zeke and Mo sitting on the main auction floor.
59.

Two art handlers bring out a piece.

AUCTIONEER
Our next item up for bid is a
Lucean Cutler oil on canvas. We’1l
start the bidding at three thousand
five hundred.

Zeke raises his paddle. The auctioneer takes note. Another
man in the back raises his arm to bid.

ZEKE
Look at this asshole back here. He
thinks he’s so fucking smug. Look
at him he’s in work out clothes. Oh
he just thought he’d swing by the
gallery and pick up a Lucien Cutler
on his way home from the gym.
Monroe? Are you listening to me?

MONROE
Who are you talking about?

ZEKE
This guy back here.

Zeke raises his paddle again. The bidding is now at ten
thousand. The gentleman raises his hand, Zeke is furious.

CUT TO:

INT. ZEKE’S CAR - LATER

The boys sit in the car in the parking lot of a fast food
restaurant. The large painting on the back seat behind them.
Mo digs through a brown paper bag and gives Zeke his burger.

MO
No pickles?

ZEKE
That’s mine.

They eat, not saying anything until...

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Holly's pissed at me.

MO
Oh.

Neither boy is emotionally mature enough for this.
60.

ZEKE
Yeah.

MO
Are you guys going to break up?

ZEKE
I don’t know.

MO
Do you want to?

Zeke shrugs.

MO (CONT'D)
Is she mad because of all the-

He points at the painting.

ZEKE
No I don’t think she cares about
that. Girls are just weird man.
They get pissed at you for shit you
don’t even know you are doing.

MO
What didn’t you know you were
doing?

ZEKE

Being an asshole.

MO
Oh. Did you apologize?

ZEKE
No I can’t apologize. Because that
means that I agree I’m being an
asshole. And I don’t.

MO

ZEKE

Girls are just crazy. They always
get this way. But the good thing
is, if you date enough of em you
will realize that there are only
like five different ways they can
freak out on you. There is nothing
that surprises me anymore.

MO
What could she do?
61.

ZEKE
It’s more of a general attitude.
She could either ignore me
completely. Girls think that works
on guys because they know it works
on them. But guys love being left
alone.

MO
We do?

ZEKE
You bet your ass we do.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
She could go the other way and hit
me up non stop. Just like a
hysteric baby and you can’t hide
from them and you don’t know how to
make it stop. Holly isn’t that kind
of girl though. She could try to
fuck Nick or Tony.

MO
What?

ZEKE
Probably Nick.

MO
(shocked)
What do you mean?

ZEKE
Girls are nuts man. They’1l fuck
your best friend if they think that
will make you jealous.

MO
But Nick would never do it right?

Zeke shrugs.

MO (CONT'D)
He would?

ZEKE
How are things going with your
girl?

MO
Sophie?
62.
ZEKE
Yeah.

MO
Pretty great.

ZEKE
You can probably stop giving her
attention now.

MO
What? But she likes me. We kissed.

ZEKE
Yeah, but start ignoring her and
see how obsessed she gets.

MO
I don’t think she’1l-

ZEKE
Trust me bud.

ZEKE’S APARTMENT

Zeke hangs the painting on his wall.

MO

I think I am going to take off.
ZEKE

You should stay and smoke with me.
MO

Nah.
ZEKE

I promise you'll be fine.

MO
My Dad’s birthday party is tonight.

ZEKE
Isn't that in like eight hours?

Zeke pulls a bong out of the closet.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Let’s celebrate.

MUSIC: TOP GUN - DANGER ZONE

MO

ZEKE
Like 5 something.

MO
Shit, I have to go.
INT. MONROE’S CAR - LATER
DANGER ZONE is still blasting in the backround. Mo is at the
wheel swerving through traffic like a madman. He can hear
cars honking all around him.
EXT. MONROE’S CAR - SAME TIME
Mo is actually driving five miles an hour and several cars
behind him are honking, trying to pass.
INT. MONROE’S SHOWER - LATER
Monroe is in the shower, somehow trying to wash his eyes. He
sits down in the shower and takes a quick nap.
INT. BATHROOM - LATER
He psyches himsef up the mirror.
MO
You are fine. You are totally
natural. You aren’t stoned. People

smoke weed all the time and nobody
ever notices. You are so fine.
64.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER
His parents sit at the table talking.
MONROE

Standing outside the kitchen still trying to psyche himself
up.

He listens to them talking. They start to laugh at a joke he
can’t hear. On that he walks in laughing as well, he thinks
this will blend him in but he just looks like a crazy person.

REUBEN
What’s wrong with you?

MO
What? I mean excuse me?

He sits down at the table, still trying to appear normal.

MO (CONT'D)
Are we going to this thing?
SHERRI
Oh no. Reuben what’s wrong with
him?
REUBEN

I think I know.
Monroe can hear them talking but can’t bring his mouth to
rebuttal. So he just continues to act as if nothing is
happening.

MO
I totally forgot, Happy Birthday!

He gets up and give’s his father a hug.

SHERRI
What are we going to do?
REUBEN
I don’t know this is a nightmare.
(to Mo)
How could you do this on my
birthday.
MO

Do what?
65.

SHERRI
Do you have any idea how much
trouble you are in?

MO
Hmm?

REUBEN
Let’s just go we are going to be
late.

SHERRI

Should we leave him at home?

REUBEN
I don’t know how to explain to my
parents that Mo got too stoned.

MO
Guys, you are wrong.

SHERRI
About what?

MO
Everything. All of it.

REUBEN
Jesus Christ.

INT. CAR - LATER

The parents sit up front. Reuben drives. Mo is in the
backseat, trapped in his own mind.

REUBEN
This is exactly what I’m talking
about. Ten seconds of stupid.

MO
I think it’s been a
misunderstanding.

SHERRI
Please stop talking Monroe.

REUBEN
Listen, when we go inside. You kiss
your grandparents hello. You say
nothing else. Are you listening to
me?
66.

MO’s POV - His parents are moving in slow motion and sound
like the teacher from Charlie Brown.

The car pulls up to Mo’s grandparents house. His parents give
each other one last look.

SHERRI
Please don’t eat too much.

REUBEN
Oh shit, you're right.
(to Mo)
Don’t even go near the buffet. Just
say hi and go sit down somewhere, I
will give you food.
EXT - GRANDPARENTS HOUSE
The three of them walk to the door.

SHERRI
We good?

MO
We're great!

REUBEN
You are a real idiot.
The door opens. It’s Mo’s grandmother.
GRANDMOTHER
Hello! Come on in. Take off your
coats.

The family takes off their jackets.

GRANDMOTHER (CONT’D)
Hi Monroe.

MO
What- Hi.

GRANDMOTHER
How’s school going?

MO
(long pause)
A lot.
BUFFET

Mo walks past, eyeing the mini hot dogs.
67.

REUBEN
(sotto)
Don’t even think about it.

TABLE

Mo sits at the table not saying anything. Kate and Doug are
on either side of him. The three of them whisper to each
other.

KATE
How high are you right now?
MO
Quiet.
KATE
Nobody can hear me.
MO
How obvious is it?
DOUG
Nobody can tell, you are doing
great.
KATE

Do Mom and Dad know?

MO
I’m not sure. I don’t think so.

Across the table Reuben glares at his son.

CUT TO:

MONROE IN HIS ROOM ON THE PHONE WITH ZEKE

ZEKE (V.O.)
(on the phone)
Grounded?
MO
Big time.
ZEKE

You will never guess what I am
doing right now.

MO
What?
68.

ZEKE
I'm shaving.

Reveal Zeke is in his bathroom shaving, he has a bluetooth
phone in his ear.

MO
What do you mean?

ZEKE
I got one of those bluetooth
things. I am fucking shaving and
talking to you at the same time.

MO
I’m in a lot of trouble man, will
you just focus.

ZEKE
Are you allowed to go to school?

MO
Yes Isaac, my parents are not
banning me from going to school.

ZEKE
That’s good I guess. You are still
going to that party tomorrow night
right?

MO
Are you listening to me at all.

ZEKE
Mo, you gotta go. Nick already got
everything.

MO
I can't.

ZEKE
Sneak out. You have to Momo. You’11l
be fine.

SHERRI
Monroe?

Reveal Sherri in the kitchen on the other phone line.

MO
I’m on the phone.

MOM
Who are you talking to?
69.

MO
Zeke.

SHERRI
Hi Isaac. I am guessing Monroe told
you he is in a bit of trouble.

ZEKE
Yes he mentioned that.

SHERRI
I just don’t understand where these
kids are getting the drugs.

ZEKE
Are you kidding me? The kids at his
school, it’s everywhere. I bet they
are selling it right there on the
playground at recess.

MO
I’m a junior in high school we
don’t have recess or a playground.

SHERRI
Was this going on when you were in
high school?

ZEKE
I had heard about certain kids
doing it. And I was at one or two
parties where it was offered to me,
but it just seems so gross ya know?
It’s like why do that to yourself?
The human brain is a gift, we need
to treat it like-

MO
Alright Rabbi, thank you for that I
think she get’s it.

SHERRI
I wish some of that would rub off
on your friend.

ZEKE
I’m trying. Oh hey Mrs. K, guess
what I am doing right now?

MO
She doesn’t care.

ZEKE
I'm shaving.
70.

SHERRI
How?

ZEKE
Bluetooth.

SHERRI
Wow.

ZEKE
I know.

SHERRI

Alright, well good night Isaac. Mo,
your shot is ready.

MO
Okay I’m coming down.

She hangs up.

MO (CONT'D)
I hate you.

ZEKE
I think they are going to let me
adopt you.

MO
Goodbye.

ZEKE
You are going to the party.

Mo hangs up.

INT. SCHOOL - DAY

Monroe walks down the hall. He sees Sophie, she sees him, he
doesn’t say anything. She is confused but shakes it off. Mo
is very unsure of this plan.

Epstein approaches.

EPSTEIN
Yo baby. You coming tonight?

MO
I don’t know, might have to sit
this one out.

EPSTEIN
No no no. You can’t miss this.
71.

MO
I’m grounded, dude. My hands are
tied.

EPSTEIN

Sneak out. Come after your parents
go to sleep.

MO
Listen man, I said I can’t.

EPSTEIN
I am begging you.

Just then the two boys see Danny and Josh being escorted out
of the principals office.

MO
What were Josh and Danny doing in
Mr. Wool’s office.

EPSTEIN
What?

MO
Look, Danny and Josh were just
talking to Mr. Wool.

EPSTEIN
I don’t know man. That could be
anything.

MO
Fuck this.

EPSTEIN
You are being paranoid man.

MO
The school is on to us. I’ve got to
sneak out of my house. I’m the only
one taking a risk.

EPSTEIN
We're all taking risks baby.

MO
Don’t call me baby.

EPSTEIN
You need to calm down Mo. Nobody
knows anything.

Mo hates having this conversation in school.
72.

MO
Will you just keep it down.

EPSTEIN
So we have a deal?

MO
The price is going up.

EPSTEIN
I love you. I fucking love you. Oh
by the way you think you could
bring some ecstasy.

MO
What do I look like to you?

EPSTEIN
Is this a trick question?

Mo just stares at him.
EPSTEIN (CONT'D)

Ya know what. Forget about ecstasy.

I have a huge exam tomorrow anyway.
INT. KAUFMAN KITCHEN - NIGHT
Mo's parents are in the kitchen drinking wine and talking.
UPSTAIRS
INSERT - TEXT FROM SOPHIE: “MO?”
It kills him but he ignores it. Zeke better be right.
Mo is in his room directly above them, moving around quietly.
He puts on camouflage pants and a camouflage shirt. He goes
to the bathroom where he has laid out green and black face
paint. He paints his face.
Mo moves to the window of his bedroom.
FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW
We see Mo open the window and climb out onto the ledge of the
house. The second floor isn’t that high up, but Mo’s height
makes the drop seem much scarier. He grabs on to a nearby
tree and tries his best to shimmy to the ground. Eventually

he falls off and lands in some bushes. From the kitchen
window his parents are oblivious to the whole thing.
73.

Trying to stay under the view of the window, he crawls to the
end of the driveway.

EXT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT
Mo walks into the house. The banner reads “GI JOES AND ARMY
HOS”. Our hero blends in nicely in a sea of military fatigues
(and camo underwear. )
Eppy is on his knees drinking from a beer bong, but the
crowed surrounding him rushes over to greet Mo, leaving him
alone on his knees holding the giant funnel to his mouth.
Sophie sees Mo and waves. Ignoring her, he walks with a group
of boys to the bathroom.
INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT
Zeke is on his couch with a bowl of cereal. He is in his
boxers and has the phone pinned between his shoulder and his
ear.

ZEKE

You have a pretty voice.

INT. ART GALLERY - AUCTION - INTERCUT
One of the phone bank girls, ALLISON.

ALLISON

Mr. Presanti, the bidding is up to
six thousand.

ZEKE
Would you like to have dinner with
me?

ALLISON

Mr. Presanti, if you want to just
tell me your maximum bid, I will
just bid to your max and you don’t
need to sit on the phone.

ZEKE
You aren’t enjoying talking to me
as much as I am.

ALLISON
I am in the middle of an auction.
74.

ZEKE
Can you go someplace quiet?

She laughs.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
I am making you laugh. Do you have
a boyfriend?

ALLISON
This is really inappropriate.

ZEKE
Something tells me there aren’t any
rules about flirting with
prospective buyers. Something tells
me it is recommended or they
wouldn't have such pretty girls
like yourself working the phones.

ALLISON
I don’t have a boyfriend.

ZEKE
Of course you don’t. I was recently
broken up with.

ALLISON
Why did she break up with you?

As Allison talks she makes silent handmotions to the
auctioneer raising his bid at will.

ZEKE
I don’t know.
(he turns to the other
room)
Why did you break up with me?

Holly walks from the kitchen through the living room carrying
a bag of her stuff. She gives him the middle finger on her
way out.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
I think it’s still a little raw.

The auctioneer bangs the podium.

ALLISON
Congratulations, you are now the
proud owner of an 8,000 dollar
Fujikawa painting.
75.

ZEKE
Is it any good?

ALLISON
Meh.

INT. HOUSE PARTY - SAME TIME

Mo comes out of the bathroom first. He looks around the party
and then we track behind him to the front door like we always
do, except before he can make his escape somebody blocks the

exit.

SOPHIE
What is wrong with you?
MO
Excuse me?
SOPHIE
You have been a dick to me all
week.
MO

I know - I’m not, I--

SOPHIE
You didn’t seem like an asshole but
maybe that’s your secret. You’re a
secret asshole.

She starts to walk away.

MO
I’m not. It wasn’t my idea. I’m
sorry. Zeke thought if I didn’t
give you attention you would like
me more.

SOPHIE
You are an idiot.

MO
I know. A big idiot. Huge one.
Please. Give me another chance. I
won’t mess it up.

She looks at him.

MO (CONT'D)
Let’s go on a real date. None of
this dress up bullshit. Let’s go
out for real.
76.

SOPHIE
You gonna take anymore advice from
your friend?
MO
He’s dead to me I swear!
INT. MO’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
With smeared face paint Mo drives home completely ecstatic.

He sings DAVID BOWIE - YOUNG AMERICAN’S at the top of his
lungs as he drives.

WIDE SHOT - KIDS AT THE PARTY DANCING AND MAKING OUT

EXT. MO’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Mo stands in front of his window trying to jump up and reach
the tree branch. He can’t do it. He gives it a running start
but still no luck.

MO
Oh fuck it.

He walks in the front door.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSE UP - A CAR WHEEL SPINNING

INT. CAR - SAME TIME

Three obscured boys in army fatigues drive in a cloud of weed
smoke and sing along with the radio.

CLOSE UP - THE TIRE SKIDS OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
SFX - CAR CRASH

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

The principal sits at his desk with a uniformed police
officer standing behind him. They talk to a man and woman
77.

OFFICER
I just don’t want there to be any
confusion between us. I don’t want
you to think that your son is off
the hook, because he is not. The
only reason you are sitting here
talking to us is because I ama
practical person. I am not trying
to clog a leak with my finger I am
trying to build a dam. I am trying
to rid this community of all the
underage drinking and drugs that go
on almost every night. Jonathan was
behind the wheel of a car, not only
drunk, but stoned on marijuana and
cocaine. And like I said the only
reason you are sitting here today
is because I want to know who is
responsible for selling these drugs
to him and his friends.

We pan from the distraught parents to reveal Epstein sitting
in the corner of the office, holding back tears.

OFFICER (CONT'D)
Principal Wool has been very
generous in allowing to keep
Jonathan enrolled in school on the
basis of his cooperation.

MONROE’S HOUSE - DAY

His parents are sitting at the table. Reuben is reading the
paper.

SHERRI
Monroe wants to go out.

REUBEN
To a party? Not a chance-

SHERRI
On a date.

Reuben is impressed.

REUBEN
My Monroe? With who?

SHERRI
Sophie something.

REUBEN
What does she look like?
78.

SHERRI
Does it matter?

REUBEN
No of course not, I was just- It’s
your call, I don’t care.

SHERRI
I don’t like him driving after that
car accident.

REUBEN
So say no.

SHERRI
Well I don’t want to take this away
from him-

REUBEN
So say yes, for christ sake what do
you want from me?

SHERRI

Maybe we can send him with
somebody, have somebody else drive?

INT./EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE

Reuben answers the front door for Zeke.

REUBEN
Hi Isaac.

ZEKE
Mr. Kaufman.

REUBEN
Come on in.
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
The four of them sit around the kitchen table.
SHERRI
You understand Zeke this is a
special privilege for Mo.

ZEKE
Yes.
79.

SHERRI
A group of boys in Monroe’s class
got in a car accident, there were
drugs AND alcohol in their system.

ZEKE

Oh my goodness.
MO

Do we really have to do this?
REUBEN

Will you go wait for Isaac in his

car.
Isaac throws him his car keys, Mo leaves the room.

REUBEN (CONT'D)
No drinking. No drugs.

ZEKE

Got it. But what about Mo?
REUBEN

What?
ZEKE

It was a joke.

REUBEN
Sherri is very worried about these
kids drunk driving around.

ZEKE
I would never let anything happen
to Mo.

REUBEN

Listen Isaac, I like you. And that
Eddie Haskel shit works wonders on
Sherri but not me. I work in
advertising... so...

(off Zeke’s unsure look)
Mo looks up to you, he never had an
older brother, and that’s how he’s
always seen you.

ZEKE
I understand.

REUBEN
I’m not your father. Just-just
sometimes I think you and your
friends forget he is sixteen.
80.

ZEKE
Yes sir.

Reuben takes a twenty dollar bill out of his pocket and slips
it into Zeke’s hand.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Mr. Kaufman, I can’t.

REUBEN
Please take it.

ZEKE
I like hanging out with Mo, it
isn’t a job.

REUBEN
That’s why I am giving you this.
Because it is a job. If he starts
smoking dope and drinking, you
aren’t doing your job.

ZEKE
Well I think he’s a pretty good
kid.

REUBEN
I do too.

ZEKE

So can I have a raise?
REUBEN
Get out of my house.
INT. ZEKE’S CAR - LATER
The boys are driving to pick up Sophie.

MO
Listen, do me a favor.

ZEKE
What?

MO
Don’t be you tonight.

ZEKE
(laughing)
Who would you like me to be?
81.

MO
I’m serious. Your shitty advice
almost cost me this date. I just
don’t want tonight to be the Zeke
show.

ZEKE
The Zeke show! ?

MO
You know what I mean. You don’t
always have to be the bride at
every wedding and the corpse at
every funeral.

ZEKE
How long have you been waiting to
use that one?

MO
A while.

ZEKE
You need to relax.

MO
Don’t tell me to relax, I am very
relaxed. Why? Do I not seem
relaxed, fuck it. Turn around.

ZEKE
Do you not trust me?

MO
I trust you.

ZEKE
Would you even be going on a date
if it wasn’t for me?

MO
I am going on this date in spite of
you.

ZEKE

Would you have kissed her if it
wasn’t for me?

MO
What kind of credit are you looking
for here?

The car pulls up in front of Sophie’s house. Zeke honks the
horn.
82.

MO (CONT'D)

Don’t do that. I’ll go get her.
ZEKE

No you won’t. Trust me, this is

better.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Here, take this.

He pulls out a small pill from the pocket of his jean jacket.

MO
What is it?

ZEKE
It’s a Valium. It will chill you
out. Make you much more appealing.

MO
Actually?
ZEKE
Yeah.
MO
Does it have any side effects?
ZEKE
No, just don’t drink too much.
MO
I wasn’t planning on drinking at
all.
ZEKE

Then you’1ll be great.

He takes the pill. Then looks to the house. POV - Sophie
coming out. She looks great.

Zeke opens the middle compartment and then back in his
pocket. Then around as if he is searching for something.

MO
What’s wrong?

ZEKE
Don’t freak out.

MO
About what?
83.

ZEKE
I think I just gave you an Ambien.

MO
What?

Sophie is almost at the car.

ZEKE
(he takes a pill out of
the bottom of the cup
holder)
Because here is the valium and I
only had one.

MO
What kind of an operation are you
running here?

ZEKE
It’s going to be okay.

MO
You gave me a sleeping pill, why
would you even bring that?

ZEKE
It was an accident.

He looks out the window. Frantic.

MO
How long do I have?

ZEKE
Minutes.

MO
Minutes?

ZEKE

Maybe twenty good ones.
Sophie reaches her hand to open the back door.

MO
Abort. Abort. Drive the car.

Zeke starts to drive the car. Sophie is confused.

MO (CONT'D)
No, stop. Fuck.

The car stops. Sophie gets in.
84.

SOPHIE
(half laughing, half
serious)
What was that?

MO
I’m sorry, Zeke drives like a
retard.

Zeke shoots him a look. Then looks at Sophie.
SOPHIE

Is this your idea of not involving
Zeke in our relationship?

MO
I’m sorry, I didn’t want this
either.

ZEKE

Hey, I’ve got feelings you two.

SOPHIE
Where are we going?

ZEKE
Yeah Romeo, where are we going.

MO
(scared to death)
Something fast I think. Right?

SOPHIE
I have nowhere to be.

ZEKE
(starting to enjoy this)
Me either.

MO
I thought you had that thing in
twenty minutes Zeke? That
appointment?

ZEKE
No I am severely unemployed thanks
for reminding me.

SOPHIE
Is everything okay?

MO
Yeah, it’s fine.
85.

ZEKE
He’s just nervous I think. Would
you relax? You guys have already
kissed right?

ZEKE (CONT’D)
(to Sophie)
He kissed you right?

SOPHIE
Yes.

Mo is mortified.

ZEKE
(to Mo)
See dude you're fine, the hardest
part is over.
(to Sophie)
How was he?

MO
Oh for the love of god would you-

SOPHIE
He was good.

MO
What?

ZEKE
Don’t sound so surprised buddy I
bet you were great.

Mo has a very pleased look on his face.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Okay youngins, where is this love
bus going?

MO
I don’t know.
(to Sophie)
Whatever you want to do.

ZEKE
Never tell a girl you’1l do
whatever she wants, pretty soon she
is going to want to do your
friends.

MO
(sotto)
Zeke show?
86.

ZEKE
Sorry, I’m just trying to help.

MO
Ice cream?

ZEKE
Are you asking her or-

MO
Ice cream!

ZEKE
There it is.

SOPHIE
He really is your relationship
coach.

MO
He’s more of a sociopath than a
coach.

She laughs. Zeke looks to Mo and gives him a thumbs up.
ZEKE
(mouths )
You're doing great.
MO

(mouths )
Fuck you.

EXT. ICE CREAM SPOT - LATER

They sit outside at a picnic table eating. Mo is holding onto
consciousness for dear life.

ZEKE
Okay I’ve got one.

SOPHIE
Alright go.

ZEKE

Would you rather every time you
take a shower Gatorade comes out of
the faucet Or-

SOPHIE
That's gross. Can I shower in the
sink?
87.

ZEKE
Hmm. No. You can drink water but
any time it touches your body it is
Gatorade. OR Everything you eat
from now on will taste like
pickles. No matter what the fuck it
is, it tastes like pickles.

SOPHIE
I like pickles.

ZEKE
Every day for every meal for the
rest of your life?

SOPHIE
It’s better than pouring sticky
colored water all over myself.
(to Mo)
What would you do?

MO
Which one is that bad guy?

SOPHIE
Excuse me?

Mo forces an out of place laugh.

MO
Sort of tastes like breakfast food
even though you wouldn’t right or
no? No.

Zeke shakes him.

ZEKE
Hang in there buddy.

MO
You know what would go great with
this ice cream? Pyramids.

SOPHIE
Is he having a stroke.

MO
It’s not me fault. You’re pretty I
like you you're pretty.

ZEKE
(Sotto to Mo)
Stop fighting it, you’re making it
worse.
88.

MO
(shutting his eyes)
I'm just closing for one minutes.
Not even.

Mo falls asleep, collapsing into his cup of Mint Chocolate
Chip.

SOPHIE
Oh my god.
INT. ZEKE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Zeke and Sophie sit in the front. Monroe is asleep but
propped up in the back seat.

ZEKE

Well this is a strange situation
SOPHIE

Yeah.
ZEKE

Listen, don’t let this whole, Mo

passing out thing turn you off. He
really is a great guy. And this is
probably like 10 percent my fault.

SOPHIE
You guys are really running a great
operation over here.

ZEKE
That's what he said! See you two
are perfect for each other.
(then)
Okay, let’s get you home.

INT/EXT KATE KAUFMAN HOUSE - LATER

Monroe's older sister answers the door. Zeke is holding Mo
like a baby in his arms.

ZEKE
(as if nothing was wrong)
Hey Kate.
KATE

Oh my god what’s wrong with him.
89.

ZEKE

(annoyed at her lack of

manners )
How about: Hi Zeke. Nice to see
you. How are you? It’s been a long
time. This is a nice surprise. You
look great. Did you lose some
weight? I can’t stop thinking about
you.

KATE
Does he need to go to the hospital?

ZEKE

(Stepping into the house)
No, he took an Ambien.
Accidentally. I let him out of my
sight for one second and you know-

(then)
You've done a little redecorating
since the last time we were here.

KATE
You drugged him? Is he going to be
okay?

ZEKE

You know I recently came into a
small collection of art myself. A
few Cutlers, a Fujikawa print.
Mostly up and comers. You should
come over some time and check it
out.

KATE
I’m calling my parents.

ZEKE
Please don’t. He’s fine I promise.
He just needs to sleep this off.
Can I put him down somewhere?

KATE
Put him on the couch.

Zeke walks over to the couch and lays him down. He waits
until Kate is looking in his direction and then kisses Mo on
the forehead.

ZEKE
(for her benefit)
It’s going to be okay buddy.
90.

KATE
So what I just wait until he wakes
up and then take him home?

ZEKE
I would really feel more
comfortable waiting with him. Your
parents aren’t expecting him home
for a few hours, he’1ll be up by
then.

She looks at him, knowing full well what he’s doing.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Your Dad gave me a big speech,
there may have been a cash bribe. I
don’t want him to think he can’t
trust me with Mo’s safety.

KATE
(indicating her passed out
brother)
Yeah I don’t know why he would ever
think that. Mo looks up to you. You
have to take better care of him.

ZEKE
(defensive)

I reuse those pill bottles over and
over. It’s very hard to keep track.
(He looks to Mo then turns

back to Kate)
Do you have any water or something?

KATE
That’s a good idea, do you think
he’1l drink it.

ZEKE
I meant more for me.

She rolls her eyes and walks into the other room. Zeke looks
around at the house.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
So where’s what-his-face?

KATE (0.S.)
(from the other room)
You know his name.

ZEKE
Where is Doug?
gl.

KATE (V.O.)
Doug is at an opening.

ZEKE
That sounds about right, what a
prick. Why didn’t you go?

KATE (V.O.)
I didn’t feel like getting dressed
up.

Zeke looks at his sleeping friend on the couch and then gets
up and goes to the kitchen. He comes up from behind and puts
his arms around her.

ZEKE
You know if you were my girlfriend,
you would never have to get dressed
up for anything.

She pretends not to like what’s going on.

KATE
Of course not, we would just smoke
pot and watch Top Gun every night
until we starved to death.

She turns around so they are face to face.

KATE (CONT'D)
You aren’t a kid anymore. But he
is. And you aren’t doing him any
favors. Getting him stoned before
my Dad’s birthday. Drugging him
like this, and god knows what else.

ZEKE
(thinking about everything
else)
That's pretty much it.

KATE
It’s obvious that he hangs out with
you so he can feel cool. But one
day he is going to wake up and
realize you are just hanging out
with him because you need to feel
cool too, and he is the last person
on earth who thinks you are. And
then he won't.

This lands hard with Zeke. He drops his head, this is the
most vulnerable we’ve seen him.
92.

KATE (CONT'D)
I’m sorry. That was maybe too far.

He lifts his head and kisses her.

KATE (CONT'D)
(pulling away)
What are you doing?

ZEKE
I just thought-

KATE
THAT is what you took away from
what I just said?

Long silence.

ZEKE
I love you.

KATE
Don’t say that. Even if it’s true
don’t say it.

He kisses her hard, this time she doesn’t pull away.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ZEKE’S CAR - LATER

Mo slowly wakes up and tries to get his bearings. He is
sitting in the passenger seat. They are parked in front of
Mo's house.

MO
What happened?

ZEKE
You did great tonight buddy.

MO
I fell asleep.
(waking up)
You drugged me.
(very awake)
Oh god you son of a bitch what did
you do?

ZEKE
It’s fine. Everything is fine.
Relax.
MO
Don’t tell me to relax. The last
time you told me to relax I passed
out in my Ice Cream. Oh fuck, I
need to call her.

ZEKE
No no man, it was cool. Like you
didn’t give a shit. Like you
couldn’t be bothered to stay awake.

MO
You really are a psycho.

Mo get’s out of the car.
Zeke sits in the car. Thinking about what Kate

about this boy who’s life he continues to mess
up the music and drives away.

EXT. MO’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Before Mo can make it to the front door he get’

call.
MO
Hello? - Right now? - Is everything
okay? - I’m sort of - Nothing - Can
it wait until tomorrow? Okay I’m on
my way.

Mo walks to his car and get’s in.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING
He rings the buzzer.

MO
It’s me.

The front door buzzes and he rushes in.

INT. APARTMENT

93.

said. Thinking
up. He turns

s a phone

Holly opens the front door, she is in a towel, fresh out of
the shower. She holds an empty drink in her hand and Mo can

smell the whiskey coming out of her pores.

MO
What’s wrong?
94.

HOLLY
Come in.

MO
You made it seem like you were in
trouble.

HOLLY

Oh stop being dramatic.

MO
(still panting a little)
Me? You literally said “come quick
I’m in trouble.”

HOLLY
You are hilarious.
(Then)
I’m going to go get dressed. Make
us a refill.

MO
Um-—

He walks over to the bar she has set up in the corner of the
studio apartment.

MO (CONT'D)
I have to be up really early
tomorrow, I should probably-

HOLLY
So just because me and Zeke broke
up you don’t want to be my friend
anymore? That’s pretty lame.

MO
No it’s not that.

HOLLY
One drink. I just want to catch up.

He gives up. She puts on a record, something sexy.

MO
Your apartment is very adult.

He fumbles his way around the bar trying to remember how Zeke
makes whiskey sours.

When he finally finishes he brings the drinks into the room
where Holly is sitting at a white vanity next to her bed. She
is completely naked combing her hair. He can see her body
reflected in the mirror. She smiles at him.
95.

MO (CONT'D)
(gulping)
I thought you just wanted to catch

up?
She puts on a turquoise silk robe and stands up to face him.

MO (CONT'D)
You don’t want to-

HOLLY
You are a really good guy.

His voice cracks.

MO
Thanks.

HOLLY
You are a lot better than your
friend.

MO

Well I- I don’t think it’s a
competition. We both have our
strengths-—

She opens her robe.

MO (CONT'D)
-and weaknesses.

HOLLY
Have you ever thought about doing
this with me?

MO
Yes.

She pushes him onto the bed.

SFX - A crowd cheering

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

Mo walks up to the plate. Everybody in the stands are
chearing for him, including Zeke, Tony and Nick. Mo clearly
has a pit in his stomach.

The first ball flies by.

UMP
Strike.
96.

He looks at Zeke who motions for him to get lower. Mo
crouches down. The pitch...

UMP (CONT'D)
Ball 1

PITCHER
He’s too short, I have nowhere to
put the ball.
NICK
(yelling from the stands)
Hey asshole I’1l show you where you
can put the ball.
The pitch...

UMP
Ball 2.

Angle on the boys clapping.

Angle on Mo looking at Zeke, feeling terrible.

ZEKE
I’m worried about Mo.
NICK
What about him?
ZEKE
I think we are getting him in over
his head.
The pitch...
UMP
Ball 3.
NICK

He’s loving it.

ZEKE
He’s loving it because he thinks
he’s impressing us.

NICK
So what do you want to do?

ZEKE
I don’t know, I think he is just
losing it a little. Those kids
crashed the car, and the roofie
date. I’m just worried-
97.

TONY
(Godfather impression)
This is not the life I wanted for
my boy.

The pitch....

UMP
Ball 4. Take your base.

Mo walks to first base.

ZEKE
(yelling from the stands)
There you go baby. Just like that.
Every time, every fucking time.
(sitting down)
Love that little shrimp.

INT. MO’S ROOM - NIGHT

It’s snowing outside. Mo is on the phone as he looks out his
window and sees Nick and Tony pull up outside the mailbox.

MO
They just got here.

ZEKE’S APARTMENT
Zeke is talking on his bluetooth while doing crunches.

ZEKE
Alright. You okay?

MO
Yeah, I’m good. Do I not seem good?
I’m good. I swear.

ZEKE
Are you just nervous about seeing
Sophie?

MO

No, no. I mean, yeah sort of.

ZEKE
Well don’t worry, it’s going to be
great. I know she likes you. You
already have it on lock.

MO
You think?
98.
ZEKE
You're going to do great.

MO
Alright, I’1l talk to you after.

Mo hangs up feeling like a big asshole.

EXT./INT. HOUSE PARTY NIGHT

We track behind Mo as he walks into the party. This is easily
the biggest house we’ve seen yet. Snow covers the front yard.

The banner in front reads “Christmas Bros and Ho Ho Hos”

Unlike everybody else, Mo didn’t really feel like dressing
like Santa.

BASEMENT

He sees a girl he recognizes.

MO
Hey do you know if Sophie is here?
GIRL
No.
MO
No she’s not here or no you don’t
know?

The girl is gone before he can finish his sentence.

INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zeke is playing video games and eating cereal in his
underwear. There is a knock at the door.

He get’s up to answer it. It’s Holly, she has been crying.

ZEKE
Hey you okay? Come in.

Without saying anything she moves to the couch and tries to
catch her breath.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
What’s wrong?

HOLLY
I miss you.
99.

ZEKE
Hol.

HOLLY
I know I screwed up with the whole
Mo thing.

ZEKE

What whole Mo thing?

INT. HOUSE PARTY - BASEMENT

Mo walks out of the bathroom, shoving a wad of cash in his
pocket. On the other side of the party we see Epstein wearing
an elaborate Santa costume. He watches Mo.

Mo tries one more time...

MO
Hey have you seen Sophie?

RANDOM DUDE
Who's Sophie?

MO
Never mind.

EXTREME CLOSE UP - PHONE CALL
Eppy, stands in front of the house on the phone.
EPPY
Yes, Officer Peters? It’s Jonathan
Epstein. The kid you are looking
for is at 2253 Ridgeland.
(hating what he is doing)
Yes, I saw the drugs.

We are tight on Epstein but can still make out the booming
party behind him.

EPPY (CONT’D)
Yes. His name is Monroe Kaufman.

He hangs up the phone feeling embarrassed and pathetic.

INT. HOUSE PARTY - SAME TIME
Mo is about to leave the party when Sophie walks in.

SOPHIE
Mo.
100.

MO
There you are.
SOPHIE
You looking for me?
MO
Yes.
SOPHIE

Well I’m here. Are you leaving?

MO
No. Not anymore.

He turns around and walks back in with her.

INT. ZEKE’S CAR - SAME TIME

Zeke is driving his car and stuffing his face with a
cheeseburger and smoking a joint and singing along with
Ashanti’s Foolish on the radio.

ZEKE
(to himself)
My Mo?

INT - PARTY
Mo and Sophie are off in the corner watching drunk kids

acting drunk and stupid. Mo is nervous, he keeps opening his
mouth to talk and then decides not to until...

MO
I’m sorry about the other night.
SOPHIE
It’s okay. Zeke told me what
happened.
MO

I think I am realizing that Zeke
may have no idea what he is talking
about.

It’s hard to hear him over the music.

SOPHIE
You want to go upstairs?

MO
Um, yeah, sure.
They leave the kitchen and walk up stairs into a bedroom.

We see Epstein dressed as Santa looking angry at the world.

He watches them go upstairs, then chugs his beer.

INT. PARTY - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Mo closes the door.

MO
Hi.

SOPHIE
What were you saying?

Sophie sits down on the bed.

ZEKE’S CAR —- SAME TIME

Still driving, eating and singing. He slows down when he sees
three police cars turn down a nearby subdivision. He looks at
the street sign and instantly knows where they are going. He
throws the joint out the window, eats a breathmint, sprays

some freshener and makes a U-turn.

As he turns onto the street he is stopped by one of the
police cars. Their lights are off and they are forming a

quiet barricade. An officer walks to his window.

OFFICER
Sorry, this street is closed off.

ZEKE
What’s going on?

OFFICER
Some house party got out of hand.
Kids selling drugs.

ZEKE
(now very worried)
Do you know who?

OFFICER
We are going to need you to take
another way home.

ZEKE
It could just be somebody watching
TV too loudly. You shouldn’t jump
to conclusions.
102.

OFFICER
Either way sir you need to keep
moving.

ZEKE

This seems like a real waste of
manpower for a little house party.
People are getting shot up in the
street for god sake.

OFFICER
Sir are you saying you are aware of
a shooting going on right now?

ZEKE
What? No? What? I’m just- this is
my tax dollars at work man.

OFFICER
Sir if you don’t-

ZEKE
I’m going I’m going.

Zeke pulls his car around the corner and parks it. He gets
out and starts running through backyards towards the big
house at the end of the street.

INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME
Mo is pacing back and forth in front of the bed.

MO
Can we start over and have a first
date so that we can have a first
date where I didn’t pass out in
front of you and my sister’s ex-
boyfriend--

SOPHIE
Sure...

MO

--but also not totally start over
to before we kissed, because that
was stressful enough and this time
I‘1l just tell you how much I like
you instead of taking Zeke’s advice
to play it cool because let’s face
it Zeke’s advice can only really
get me as far as Zeke and is that
how far I want to go, you know? I
don’t know. I’m--
103.

SOPHIE
(interrupting his rant)
How much do you like me?

Mo snaps to attention.

MO
I really like you.

SOPHIE
I like you too. You know I liked
you before I met Zeke. I liked that
you never tried to fit in.

MO
Ya?

He sits down on the bed next to her.

SOPHIE
Yeah I thought you were like some
cool mysterious bad boy that played
by his own rules.

MO
(sarcastic)
Oh yeah, that’s totally me. Mister
bad ass.

They kiss.

INT./EXT. PARTY - FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME

Three cops burst through the front door. Forty Santas and
slutty elves scream and run in every direction.

OFFICER
Nobody move. Where the hell is
Monroe Kaufman.

They look at a nearby coffee table where a bag of cocaine has
been left out.

OFFICER 2
Don’t let anybody out.

OFFICER
Where is Monroe Kaufman?

EPPY
(pointing upstairs)
He’s upstairs in that bedroom.
104.

BEDROOM
They stop kissing.

MO
Did you hear my name?

SOPHIE
Of course I heard your name the
cops are screaming it.
Mo jumps up.
MO
I was really hoping that was in my
head.
OUTSIDE

Zeke is almost there. He is trudging through the deep snow.

ZEKE
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

BEDROOM
A loud knock on the door.
OFFICER (0.C.)
Monroe Kaufman are you in there?

Open this door. This is the police.

MO
Oh my god.

SOPHIE
How do they know your name?

Mo starts pacing around the room, not sure what to do.

Shit shit shit shit shit.
OUTSIDE
ZEKE
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
BEDROOM

MO
Shit shit shit shit shit.
105.

SOPHIE
What is going on?

Mo moves to the window at the opposite end of the room. It
faces the backyard. He opens the window and looks down. There
is a large patch of soft powdery snow, enough to cushion his
fall. He climbs out onto the ledge.

SOPHIE (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

Mo looks out the window.

MO

They’1l never take me alive.
SOPHIE

What?
MO

No, I’m kidding. They’1l totally
take me alive.

He kisses her then jumps out of the window.
He falls through the soft powder...

CRACK

..-into the frozen over swimming pool.
UNDER WATER

Mo is struggling. Trying to find a way out of the frozen
pool.

Everything goes silent.

OUTSIDE OF THE POOL

Zeke gets to the backyard of the house and looks around
frantically. He sees Sophie in the second floor window. She
points to the pool.

UNDER WATER

Terrified, Mo closes his eyes and curls up in the fetal
position.

Zeke appears under the water swimming towards Mo.

As Zeke pulls Mo to the surface, several twenty dollar bills
fall out of his pockets and float around them.
106.

OUTSIDE OF THE POOL

Zeke emerges, soaking wet with Mo, who is unconscious, thrown
over his shoulder. The music swells.

Zeke turns away from the house and runs with his friend into
the woods.

Zeke carries Mo deep into the snowy woods as fast as he can.

INT. EPSTEIN’S PARENTS MINIVAN - SAME TIME

Epstein sits in the backseat looking out in the window as
kids run in every direction from the house. He destroyed the
only thing he ever loved. A tear falls down his face as the
busted up party fades into the white snowy darkness.

INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM
We push in on Zeke’s shower. He is fully dressed holding his
friend, trying to warm him up under the hot water.

INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT —- LIVING ROOM

Mo comes out of the room, he is wearing new clothes that are
way too big on him and drying his hair with a towel.

Zeke is sitting on the couch.

MO
I’m so screwed. They know my name.
They can find me. I can’t live here
forever. It’s not big enough.

ZEKE
Did you sleep with Holly?
MO
Oh fuck. No.
ZEKE
Mo.
MO

I am so sorry. Zeke, you have to
understand. It happened so fast and
I had never- and she- and the towel-
Wait why are we even talking about
this? My life is over.

(MORE )
107.

MO (CONT'D)
So can we just figure that out and
then get back to whatever else is
going on here.

ZEKE
Oh relax. You will be fine.

MO
Easy for you to fucking say. You
have literally never cared how this
was going to end for me.
(it sinks in)
I need to run away, change my name
or something. Oh shit...my parents.

Mo collapses against the wall and starts to cry. Zeke is
unsure what to do. He tries to remember if he has ever seen
Mo cry before and if he equipped to handle this.

ZEKE
Well I mean you don’t need to go
kill yourself.

Mo doesn’t answer. He just hyperventilates into his hands.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Okay ya know what, I thought about,
and I forgive you for the Holly
thing. Our friendship is stronger
than that.

MO
(through tears)
I’m going to go to jail and end up
like you.

ZEKE
Come on, man. You’re not going to
end up like me.

MO
Of course I am. Look at me, It’s
already happened. I’m you.

ZEKE
(genuinely curious)
And that’s a bad thing?

MO
(sobbing)
It’s a nightmare.

ZEKE
Sure.
108.

He stares at his little distraught friend.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
Look, when the cops come, just tell
them I did it, say I was bringing
you the drugs and maybe you can
make a deal or something, I dunno.

Mo stops crying and looks up.

MO
Really?

ZEKE
Fuck it. sure. Yeah, I mean.
(pointing out his shitty
apartment/life)
What’s the worst they can do to me?

Mo stands up.

MO
Are you sure?

ZEKE
Go home before I change my mind.

Mo moves to the door.

ZEKE (CONT’D)
They would rather arrest a big fish
like me anyway.

Mo freezes, and turns on a dime, wiping away the last of his
tears. He opens the door.

MO
I’m the biggest fuckin’ fish there
is.

Mo leaves, slamming the door behind him so hard that Zeke’s
new painting falls off the wall and crashes to the floor. Mo
comes back in to survey the damage.

MO (CONT'D)
Oh shit, I’m sorry.

ZEKE
I’m glad you could stop crying long
enough to make such a dramatic
exit. That was a first edition
Fujikawa print. Ass.
109.

MO
Should I stay and help clean up or-

ZEKE
Goodbye.

INT. CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY

We are back where we started at the beginning. Mo is sitting
in the back of the room spaced out. When the principal and
Officer Peters walk into the room he knows exactly what is
going on.

PRINCIPAL
Monroe.

MO
Yeah.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Mo is led down the hall in handcuffs, the sea of bodies that
he was pushing his way through a few months earlier

completely splits.

FADE OUT.

ONE MONTH LATER

FADE IN:

EXT. PARK -— DAY

Mo is wearing a neon orange vest over a winter coat. He is
shoveling snow in a local park. Digging out the path as part
of his court ordered community service.

INT. CAR - SAME TIME

Zeke sits in his car watching Mo and drinking hot coffee.
After a while he honks the horn. Through the window we can
see Mo realize who it is. Zeke holds up the hot coffee. Mo
drops the shovel and walks over.

MO
I'm freezing my balls off.

ZEKE
You'll get used to it.
110.
MO
What did you bring me?

Zeke pulls out a PB and J sandwich and splits off half for
his friend.

ZEKE
Are you done over there?
MO
Yeah but now I gotta go do the
thing.
ZEKE
Again?
MO

They called my number.

(off Zeke’s annoyed look)
What do you want from me? I lost my
license. I can’t drive myself. I’m
sure they would give it back to me
if I turned you in. It might not
even be too late for that. Who
knows, I could be wearing a wire
right now.

Zeke grumbles something under his breath and turns the car
on.

MO (CONT'D)
(british accent)

Let’s go driver. Show me the

meaning of haste.

ZEKE
This is some bullshit.

INT. DRUG TESTING FACILITY - CONITNUOUS

A woman sitting at the receptionist desk greets Mo with a
smile. The waiting room is filled with some real grimey
looking halfway-house type dudes. Zeke follows behind.

MO
Just go sit over there. I’ll be a
minute.

RECEPTIONIST
Hi Monroe.

MO
Hey Rhonda.
111.

He goes up to her desk and signs in on a little clipboard
then sits down next to Zeke.

MO (CONT'D)
We gotta go by the grocery store
after this. Soph needs some stuff.

ZEKE
Are you sure I’m not third wheeling
with you guys tonight?

MO
Are you kidding? Sophie loves you.
She personally asked me to bring

you.

ZEKE
Did you ever tell her about you and
Holly?

MO

Ya know it hasn’t come up.

ZEKE
So she thinks that-

MO
She was my first, yeah.

ZEKE
Wow good for Holly. Not only did
she take your virginity. She is
also the first girl you and I have
ever both shared.

MO
First and last.
RECEPTIONIST
Monroe.
ZEKE

I don’t know man, you should see
the way Sophie looks at me.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mo pees into the cup.

INT. DRUG TESTING FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

He puts the cup of urine in the cabinet.
112.

MO
I’m feeling really good about this
batch.

RECEPTIONIST

See you on Thursday.

MO
(To a passed out addict)
Hang in there José.

Zeke follows him out.

ZEKE
Is he dead?

MO
Probably.

INT. GROCERY STORE - LATER

The boys walk down an aisle. Mo pushes the cart and reads
from the list.

MO
(reading)
Raw Catfish nuggets.

ZEKE
Shut up, it doesn’t say that.

MO
Yes it does.

ZEKE
I’m not figuring out what that is,
just bring her fish sticks.

Zeke opens the fridge and grabs a box of fish sticks.

MO
(ignoring that)
Well, I’11 tell you, I did not
think it was going to end like
this.

ZEKE
Like what?

MO
I don’t know. Everything is sort of
fine.
113.

ZEKE
Yeah man. What did you think, you
were going to end up dead ina
ditch somewhere? You sold some pot.
Nobody got hurt.

MO
Well...some people got hurt.

ZEKE
Yeah but that would have happened
with or without you. The sun
doesn’t rise and set just for you.

MO
No. I just- I don’t know. I just
feel the same. Like I am the same
person I was last year. I just go
to a different school.

ZEKE
You have a girlfriend. You are
getting laid regularly.

MO
I do like that.

ZEKE
What’s next? Let’s get out of here.

MO
(reading)
Pickled Ginger.

ZEKE
Go fuck yourself.

MO
Oh look there’s Doug.

On the other end of the aisle Doug walks towards them.

ZEKE
Oh yeah. Ya know. That guy’s not so
bad.

MO
Look at you all grown up and
mature.

ZEKE

I think I’m going to talk to him
about giving me a job.
114.

Doug socks Zeke in the face. Bringing him quickly to the
ground. He starts punching him over and over. Mo is too

stunned to intervene, he just watches as this guy savagely
beats the shit out of Zeke.

MO

That’s how I thought this would
end.

CUT TO BLACK.
THE END
