INT. HAPPY FACE MOTEL - ANOTHER PLANET - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

A shower running in a run-down motel bathroom. Walls covered
with peeling wallpaper; floors cracked and stained.

Neon light flashes through the window. The shower door is
semi-opaque, bright gelatin colors move like an oil slick
over the glass.

Through the glass, a SILHOUETTE of a MAN AND WOMAN, NUDE
showering. Hands roving, washing each other under the spray.

0.G. KOVACS (V.0.)
The first thing she taught us, is
that nothing is what it seems.

INSIDE THE SHOWER -- the Man and Woman are actually washing
BLOOD off each other's bodies.

Their movements are business-like, fast, not remotely sexual.
As blood swirls down the shower drain, revealing their bare
skin, we see these two aren't wounded -- they're splattered
with someone else's blood.

A lot of other people's blood.
On the shower floor -- A HAPHAZARD PILE OF SMALL METAL DISCS.

Each disc about the size of a cervical vertebrae, and roughly
the same shape; thick in the center, tapering on the edges.
Smeared with blood and flecks of bone.

The discs are CORTICAL DATASTACKS, simply called STACKS.

The Man -- call him ORIGINAL (0.G.) KOVACS -- detaches the
showerhead, starts rinsing the stacks. He's Asian ancestry,
strong and lean, a body built for fighting. The Woman, SARAH,
watches --

SARAH
(re: the stacks)
Who do you think they are?

0.G. KOVACS
Who cares? They're Triad. Wortha
fortune. Get the bone flecks out of
the drain, will you?

SARAH
Have you always been such a dick?

0.G. KOVACS
Every sleeve, every time.

CONTINUED:
Sarah shoves him up against the shower wall.

She grabs his arm, roughly -- we see THE TATTOO ON HIS
FOREARM: a snake devouring its own tail, the mythical
OUROBOROS. Plain black ink, beautiful detail but
monochromatic.

SARAH
Don't worry. You got nothing to
give. Neither do I.

They start having sex. There's no tenderness between them --
like watching buddies wrestling to let off steam.
Recreational, not emotional.

0.G. KOVACS (V.0.)
It happened every time, no matter
who I was with...

ON 0.G. KOVACS, as he closes his eyes --

0.G. KOVACS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I closed my eyes, and all I could
see was her.

FLASH TO -- POV 0.G. KOVACS: Looking down at A DIFFERENT
WOMAN'S FACE. Soon, we'll know who this is: QUELL.
Beautiful, in a wild, fierce way. She smiles up as they
make love --

BACK TO -- SARAH AND 0.G. KOVACS, his eyes shut, almost
desperate. The neon light washes over their coupling bodies.

ANGLE ON THE STACKS, glittering like lost treasure, piled on
the cracked shower floor. Blood swirling off them, down the
drain.

INT. HAPPY FACE MOTEL - BATHROOM - LATER

A floor-to-ceiling 3-D MIRROR takes up one wall. 0.G. Kovacs
wipes steam from its surface -- his REFLECTION snaps into
focus, a HOLOGRAM emerging toward him from the glass.

0.G. KOVACS (V.0.)
But she had been dead a long time.

POV 0.G. KOVACS: staring at himself in the mirror. A pile

of his clothes on the counter next to him. Atop the clothes,
a thin blue strand knotted on itself, strung with what look
like teal-and-white carved beads (this is a Songspire bud
branch, thin and flexible as the strands of a weeping willow).

0.G. Kovacs still staring at himself, like he's looking at a
stranger --

CONTINUED:

FLASH TO -- Quell's face, looking at him calmly on a screen,
her face sad but iron-jaw determined. Vague impression from
the background that she's in some kind of SHUTTLE --

QUELL
(almost a whisper,
tender)
Tak...

-- Then suddenly her face is CONSUMED with exploding fire
before she even has time to feel it, much less scream --

BACK TO -- 0.G. KOVACS, see he's now holding the Songspire
strand in one hand, fingers moving over the buds in an
unconscious pattern. Eyes glazed, unfocused.

He looks away from the mirror, digs almost frantically in

his clothes for a vial of pills. Different shapes and sizes.
Downs a handful in a gulp. Shakes out a cigarette and thumbs
it, self-lighting tip glowing.

Smoke winds around him as he leans against the wall, head
tilted back, trying to chase the nightmares out of his head.
RACK FOCUS to the Songspire strand, sitting on the counter,
smoke drifting down over it.

INT. HAPPY FACE MOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT

0.G. Kovacs and Sarah sleep, backs turned to each other in
the bed with garish, glittering sheets. The rest of the

room as gritty as the bathroom -- a kitchenette with a fridge,
stove, ratty cabinets.

Outside the window, TWO MOONS visible in the sky.

0.S. A FAINT METAL CLACK -- 0.G. Kovacs' eyes snap open.
Wide, unfocused. Listening --

POV 0.G. KOVACS ENVOY-VISION: building an image in his head
based on the tiny sounds he's hearing --

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MOTEL ROOM - ENVOY COMBAT-VISION

VFX: CLICKS sketch into RIFLES; RUSTLING MOVEMENTS expand to
show SHOCKTROOPERS in the hallway, every shift of a boot or
a hand expanding to show how many people are there --

INT. HAPPY FACE MOTEL - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

0.G. Kovacs wakes Sarah, a whisper in her ear, calm but this
is some serious shit --

0.G. KOVACS

SIA Shocktroopers, 12, fully armed.
Lethal loads.

SARAH
You can't know something like that --
0.G. KOVACS
Get dressed. Now.
Sarah hesitates -- then swiftly pulls on pants and shirt

heads for the kitchenette. 0.G. Kovacs cocks his head,
hearing a series of TINY CLICKS --

0.G. KOVACS (CONT'D)
Semtex-29 arc flare breacher. Two
seconds or less.

SARAH
Jesus Christ, who are you --

KERRBLOOOMMMM!!! The entire wall of the motel room EXPLODES
inward like thunder --

MAN'S VOICE
(booming)
Takeshi Kovacs!

Through the swirling fog of dust and debris --

SHOCKTROOPERS appear, full armor, insectile-eyed helmets
snub-nosed Kalashnikov 2000's (an evolution of the AK-47).

SARAH THROWS him two guns, DIVES for the other weapons --
0.G. KOVACS catches the pistols in midair, whirls as --

LEAD TROOPER
(voice amplified by
helmet )
You're under arrest --

BLAMBLAMBLAM!!! Sarah and 0.G. Kovacs both OPEN FIRE at the
same instant, diving for cover in opposite directions.

THE SHOCKTROOPERS storm in, AK-2000's blazing fire, shredding
the walls, the furniture, turning the room into a KILL ZONE --

ON 0.G. KOVACS as he leaps, twists, jumps, firing the whole
time --

POV 0.G KOVACS as he fights -- VFX ENVOY-VISION, which gives
him a fast, violent SKETCH of each Trooper's movements an
instant before it happens, his opponent's blows as phantom
limbs made of spiderweb-like material, a split-second
"precognition" of every shot, every blow, every move.

Kovacs is fast, brutal, every blow landing with laser
precision, every advantage taken, no matter how cruel.

(CONTINUED)

Street fighting meets commando skills with no mercy and no
quarter.

IN THE KITCHENETTE --

SARAH is pinned behind the overturned refrigerator, gunfire
thundering around her -- she glances over at --

THE KITCHEN TABLE -- THE REST OF THE WEAPONS still atop it.

She takes a deep breath, KICKS OUT, foot smashing into a
table-leg -- the weapons go FLYING, including A GRENADE --

BLAMBLAMBLAM! The Troopers fire at the movement, table
EXPLODES into hunks of melting plastic, she scrambles back --
at the same time neatly catching the grenade as it falls.
Sarah rips the pin with her teeth, LOBS the grenade --
LEAD TROOPER (CONT'D)
(shouts)
Get down -- !

KERRCRACKKK! The grenade EXPLODES in a halo of searing light
that BLASTS over the room at head-height --

THE LEAD TROOPER is already flat on the floor, but --

THE REST OF THE TROOPERS are caught as the blast wave ENGULFS
their helmets, clanging like a crackling web of fire.

The Troopers stagger, clawing as the helmets spark and smoke,
screaming, collapsing --

0.G. KOVACS sweeps up a fallen Kalashnikov, but --

THE LEAD TROOPER launches himself from the floor, SLAMS into
Kovacs, they both go HURTLING --

INTO THE BATHROOM

-- Where they CRASH into the MIRRORED WALL. It SHATTERS,
glass and circuitry spilling in a bright silver rain
everywhere --

ANGLE ON SARAH as she rolls from behind the fridge, comes up
in a crouch, shard pistol trained on the Lead Trooper --

BLAMBLAMBLAM!!! SARAH flies sideways, riddled with bullets --
MORE TROOPERS storm through the gaping hole in the wall.

0.G. KOVACS hesitates, distracted by Sarah's fallen body --

-- And the Lead Trooper SHOOTS him high in the leg, ATTACKS
fast and brutal, bringing 0.G. Kovacs to the floor.

LEAD TROOPER (CONT'D)
You are charged with treason against
the Protectorate, and working for
the terrorist Quellcrist Falconer.

Kovacs spits blood. Defiant.

0.G. KOVACS
I didn't work "for" her. It was
more like an autonomous collective.

The Lead Trooper KICKS him in the leg again, savagely. 0.G.
Kovacs bites back a scream of agony.

The Lead Trooper takes off his helmet so we can see his face.
He jerks 0.G. Kovacs' face down from behind so his neck is
exposed. A thin PINK SCAR at the base of 0.G. Kovacs' skull.
Puts his gun to it --

0.G. KOVACS (CONT'D)
(snarling)
Go ahead, fucking do it --

The Lead Trooper jerks 0.G. Kovacs' head up by the hair.
Frustrated.

LEAD TROOPER
(through gritted teeth)
I got orders not to make you into a
martyr.

The Troopers drag Sarah's body up to the Lead Trooper

LEAD TROOPER (CONT'D)
But they didn't say anything about
this bitch.

0.G. KOVACS
She's nobody, a local merc, she
doesn't even know who I am. Leave
her alone.

The Lead Trooper shoves her limp head forward, exposing the
same spot on the back of the neck that we saw on 0.G. Kovacs,
same hairline scar.
LEAD TROOPER
Sleeve's fragged, but stack's ok
She could live.

0.G. KOVACS
I said, leave her alone --

The Trooper snaps his gun against the base of her skull --

(CONTINUED)
ALTErED CArBON - 101 INTERIM DRAFT 7-8-16 7.
CONTINUED: (4)

BLAMM! He shoots her at the base of the skull -- strangely,
there's a bright SPARKING FLASH of metal hitting metal.

0.G. KOVACS (CONT'D)
You had to go and be a dick

0.G. KOVACS lurches to his feet, ignoring his leg wounds.
LEAD TROOPER
(sharply)
Stay down, Kovacs.

But 0.G. Kovacs keeps coming -- something about what the
Trooper did to Sarah has enraged him beyond all reason.

0.G. KOVACS
(a growl)
Fuck you.
THE TROOPER FIRES -- the muzzle FLASHES -- 0.G. KOVACS looks
down at the clean hole cauterized in his chest, the edge of
his heart visible, blood pumping down his chest --

-- And 0.G. Kovacs reaches into his chest, holding his heart
with his own hand to stop the bleeding.

0.G. Kovacs looks up, eyes blazing, fixing on the Trooper.
LEAD TROOPER
(suddenly scared)
I said fucking stay down -- !
With a ROAR, 0.G. Kovacs LAUNCHES himself like a wild animal --

ALL_THE TROOPERS open fire on him, a BARRAGE that sends 0.G.
Kovacs HURTLING back through the air --

INT. HAPPY FACE MOTEL - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
-- To crash into the splintered MIRROR in the bathroom.

0.G. Kovacs lies bleeding and broken against the sparkling
wall... blood on the mirror shards on the floor.

POV 0.G. KOVACS, lying on the floor, seeing SHOCKTROOPER

BOOTS striding toward him -- a boot CRUSHES the Songspire

strand to blue dust without noticing.

0.G. Kovacs weakly turns his head toward the shattered mirror --

-- And the last thing he sees is THE BROKEN REFLECTION OF
HIS OWN FACE, splintered image staring back at him --

SMASH TO BLACK.

FADE UP ON:

A MAN'S FACE. Eyes SHUT. Features UNNATURALLY DISTORTED --
like we're looking at him UNDERWATER.

0.G. KOVACS (V.0.)
Coming back from the dead is a bitch.

The Man's eyes suddenly SNAP OPEN. Going wider, reveal --
INT. PSYCHASEC ALCATRAZ RESLEEVING FACILITY - DAY
-- He's inside a THICK TRANSPARENT PLASTIC SAC filled with a

GEL-LIKE LIQUID. A cheap, "disposable packaging" feel to
the sac, which is lying on a battered slab.

 

0.G. KOVACS (V.0.)
Every fucking time.

We're in a MUNICIPAL FACILITY built inside the shell of the
former ALCATRAZ PRISON -- giving us the instant sense that
Kovacs is a prisoner here.

MEDTECH 1 and A TRAINEE approach the plastic sac, Trainee
bringing up a wheelchair

MEDTECH 1
They can barely walk at first, you'll
have to pull him out of the NutriSac
and lift him into the chair

TRAINEE
Do I at least get gloves or something?
I'm gonna get that shit all over me.

MEDTECH 1
You'll get used to it. Just decant
him. We've got four more to do in
the next hour.

The Trainee pulls a RED TAB on the side of the sac, ripping
it open along a pre-made seam -- the GEL spills out in thick
mucilaginous blobs as the Trainee grimaces, reaches to grab
the Man by the shoulders --

-- And the Man SUDDENLY THRASHES violently, fighting the
fluid, tears away the rest of the plastic and HEAVES himself
off the slab, crashing to the floor, vomiting gel then taking
in a huge gulp of air.

TRAINEE
What the fuck -- is that normal?

(CONTINUED)
ALTErED CArBON - 101 INTERIM DRAFT 7-8-16
CONTINUED:

MEDTECH 1
Don't panic. Sometimes they flop
around like fish, usually means their
last sleeve died violently. Just
get him in the chair.

The Man CLAWS at his chest, gasping in pain --
FLASH TO -- 0.G. KOVACS being shot in the chest --

BACK TO -- The Man gasps, reliving the shot to the chest --
yet he's not 0.G. Kovacs. What the hell... ?

TRAINEE
(freaked, backing
away )
You get him in the chair

0.G. KOVACS (V.0.)
You come off slab like something
being born, helpless and
disoriented..

Meet the new TAKESHI KOVACS: nude and slick, we can see he's
handsome, face rugged and weathered, body chiseled with the
unmistakable physique that comes only from combat.

MEDTECH 1 comes to his side, roughly takes his arm --

MEDTECH 1
All right buddy, enough of that --

0.G. KOVACS (V.0.)
Unless you're one of us.

KOVACS REACTS, blinding speed, jerks the Medtech's arm down
hard, KICKS OUT to send him crashing into the slab -- blood
seeping through his hands as he clutches his nose --

MEDTECH 1
(muffled, in pain)
Shit!

TRAINEE
Help! We need help --

2 MORE MEDTECHS come running --
MEDTECH 1

He broke my goddamned nose!
Fucking Rerun went mental on me --

MEDTECH 2
(to Kovacs)
We're going to have to sedate you if
you don't stop, you hear me?

MEDTECH 1
I am fucking bleeding here!

MEDTECH 2
Will you shut up?

Kovacs is in a loose crouch, eyes blazing, light on his feet
as he looks from Medtech 2 to Medtech 3, sizing them up --

Medtech 2 swings out a telescoping baton, starts toward Kovacs --

MEDTECH 2 (CONT'D)
Listen asshole, I said calm down --

Medtech 3 is sweeping through the holofile records --

MEDTECH 3
(realizing)
He was freighted in from U.N. Supermax
Holding on Epsilon 5.
(suddenly frightened)
Who the fuck is this quy?

Kovacs sweeps out a kick, catches Medtech 2, who goes down --
Kovacs slams an arm over his throat, CHOKING him.

KOVACS
(rasping, hoarse)
How long have I been down?

Other Medtechs rush in with what look like CATTLE PRODS, the
ends sparking with current, ready to put him down -- they
stop at the sight of Kovacs with his arm over Medtech 2.

KOVACS (CONT'D)
I'll snap his spine with my bare
fucking hands before you can take me
down. Now look in the goddamned

file and tell me how fucking long
have I been down?
The Medtechs look hesitantly at each other, unsure --
TRAINEE
(blurts out)
Five hundred years.

KOVACS
Get me a mirror.

(CONTINUED)

MEDTECH 3
(glares at the Trainee)
You need time to adjust to the new
sleeve, too fast and you risk schism
or even a psychotic break --

MEDTECH 1
(overlapping)
He's already fucking psychotic!

MEDTECH 2
(choking)
Garggh -- let -- breathe --

Kovacs looks through matted, wet hair, burning eyes fixed
straight on the Trainee, at the same time bearing down harder
on Medtech 2, who is starting to turn RED, eyes BULGING --

KOVACS
Get. Me. A _mirror.

The Trainee scrambles over to a fallen instrument table,
grabs up a small mirror, hurries back --

-- And Kovacs SNATCHES the mirror, shoving Medtech 2 away,
who crab-scuttles back, choking and gasping for air

ANGLE ON KOVACS as he raises the mirror --
0.G. KOVACS (V.0.)
Rapid sleeve acclimation. Another
thing she taught us.

KOVACS' POV: a different face than his own looking back at
him from the mirror --

-- THE FACE OF 0.G. KOVACS staring back at him.

The Medtech and Trainee stare uneasily at Kovacs, apparently
waiting for some kind of collapse or outburst.

He just keeps his eyes fixed on the mirror, staring... and
then it happens.

IN THE MIRROR: a FLICKER of something in the glass, rushing
up behind the 0.G. Kovacs' reflection like an oncoming train --

0.G. KOVACS (CONT'D)
Whatever body you were wearing --

ON KOVACS, staring in the mirror at "0.G. KOVACS'" reflection
seeing HIS "NEW" FACE moving up fast behind it.

SFX 0.G. KOVACS' VOICE BECOMING TWO VOICES, BOTH 0.G. KOVACS
AND THE NEW KOVACS --

CONTINUED: (4)

0.G. KOVACS & KOVACS (V.0.)
(voices in perfect sync)
-- You shed it like a snake sheds
its skin --

HIS NEW FACE SLAMS into 0.G. KOVACS' FACE from behind, the
features DISTORTING and RIPPLING as they reform --

-- And it hits him like the force of a BLOW, as the face in
the mirror CHANGES into the NEW KOVACS.

Now BOTH the reflection and the voice are ONLY NEW KOVACS

(our main actor) -- the visual and vocal transformation are
simultaneous.

KOVACS (V.0.)
-- And your new sleeve becomes who

you are.

Kovacs takes a single staggered step back, like he's been
gut-punched -- then straightens. Fine. Controlled and calm.

He looks around -- he's now surrounded by Medtechs, bristling
with their taser-poles. They're nervous, sweating. Scared.
Kovacs looks to the Trainee --

KOVACS (CONT'D)
Thanks for the mirror.

They start toward him, Medtech 1 motions hastily to stop --

MEDTECH 1
No, leave him, we're not supposed to
damage him --

MEDTECH 2
Damage him?

Medtech 2 staggers to his feet.

MEDTECH 2 (CONT'D)
You almost fucking killed me, man!

KOVACS
You're lucky I was in a good mood.
I hate being shot.

MED TECH 3
(shocked, disbelieving)
Most people would embolize if they
tried to transition that fast.

KOVACS

Don't sound so disappointed.
Where am I?

Bay City. Alcatraz prison.

KOVACS
What planet, genius?

MEDTECH 3
Earth.
(a little disdain)
The most civilized of all worlds
capitol of the Free Worlds

Protectorate.
KOVACS
Lucky me.
Kovacs takes a step -- they all fall back, looking scared.

KOVACS (CONT'D)
Relax. Which way's the shower?

INT. ALCATRAZ - SHOWERS - DAY

Kovacs showers, steam rising around him. Movements precise,
efficient as he rinses clean.

More NUDE PEOPLE stumble in -- unlike Kovacs, they move like
clumsy toddlers as they try to wash off the tank gel. Most
are older, or junkie-thin, strangely unhealthy looking.

Prelap a WOMAN'S VOICE, warm and professionally reassuring --

ORIENTATION WOMAN (PRELAPPED )
Welcome to Alcatraz, and
congratulations on finishing your
prison sentence!

Kovacs looks down at his body: a web of SCARS radiate over
his hand. He flexes, turning his arm, following scars that
snake up his shoulder. MORE SCARS on his back, his chest --

ORIENTATION WOMAN (PRELAPPED) (CONT'D)
You may notice that you are not in
the same body you arrived in.

INT. ALCATRAZ - RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

AN ORIENTATION WOMAN stands on a dais in the middle of a
shabby RECOVERY ROOM. More PATIENTS sit. She's officious,
cheery, annoying. Doesn't make eye contact with anyone.

ORIENTATION WOMAN
For maximum profit and efficiency,
Alcatraz Prison is owned and run by

ORIENTATION WOMAN (CONT'D)
Psychasec Galactic Corp. Now that
you have paid your debt to society,
you have been resleeved in whatever
body this facility had on hand.

Kovacs sits in the back, his black clothing well-cut
expensive but functional.

ORIENTATION WOMAN (CONT'D)
You may feel confused or strange.

A YOUNG WOMAN stares catatonically at a tress of her
unfamiliar, blond hair. Next to her a MAN pinches at the
skin of his arm as if checking to see if it's real.

ORIENTATION WOMAN (CONT'D)
Disorientation and even low-grade
amnesia are normal...

PUSH IN ON KOVACS as the Orientation Woman's voice FADES,
and Quell's VOICE rises --

QUELL (V.O.)
It all began when we discovered Elder
Civilization ruins, hidden on every
world.

INT. GUERRILLA HIDEOUT - DAY - FLASHBACK

A chamber deep in the alien ruins. RAG-TAG ENVOY RECRUITS
listening with rapt attention to QUELL -- the Woman that
Kovacs remembers making love to.

QUELL
An extinct civilization that left a
wealth of technology -- including
the alloy we used to make these.

She SLAPS A CORTICAL STACK down on the table in front of her
(the same type of discs we saw in the shower in the opening)

QUELL (CONT'D)
The cortical stack. Your own personal
hard drive of the soul.

Among the Recruits, find 0.G. KOVACS (younger than in the
opening, with the ouroboros tattoo on his forearm). Also
VIDAURA, GOMEZ, and JIMMY DESOTO, who we'll come to know.
All young and desperate.

Next to 0.G. Kovacs is a beautiful Asian woman, deceptively
delicate-looking -- Kovacs' OLDER SISTER, REILEEN

QUELL (CONT'D)

Human consciousness became software.
Bodies became sleeves. I should
know. I invented stacks.

INTERCUT WITH PRESENT DAY -- ORIENTATION WOMAN AT ALCATRAZ:

The Orientation Woman holds out a hand, and A CORTICAL STACK
rezzes into existence, floating right above her palm.

ORIENTATION WOMAN
Inside the stack is the pure human
mind, coded and stored as DHF --
Digital Human Freight.

The Orientation Woman flickers like a bad tv signal -- then
re-rezzes into existence, now with her back to us.

Her head becomes TRANSPARENT, showing the spine and skeleton
inside -- and the stack rises from her hand as she rotates,
slotting into a VERTEBRA at the base of her skull. The same
place the Trooper shot Sarah.

ORIENTATION WOMAN (CONT'D)
Your consciousness can be downloaded
into any stack, in any sleeve.

She flickers out of existence, then re-rezzes facing the
room again. Smiling blandly.

ORIENTATION WOMAN (CONT'D)
You can even needlecast in minutes
to a sleeve anywhere in the Known
Worlds.

INT. GUERRILLA HIDEOUT - DAY - FLASHBACK
Reileen looks to Quell, accusing, angry --

REILEEN
So the rise of the Protectorate is
your fault?

QUELL
I thought I was giving humanity a
way to travel instantly between the
stars,

REILEEN
Instead you were building the roads
for the Roman Empire. Why the fuck
should we listen to a word you say?

QUELL
No, she's right. What's your name,
Recruit?

REILEEN
Reileen Kawahara. This is my brother,
Takeshi Kovacs.

0.G. KOVACS
We're from Harlan's World. What's
left of it.

Quell looks over the Recruits.

QUELL
We were the transitional generation.
The first to have stacks. The
Protectorate promised us immortality,
but delivered total control, ruthless
and merciless. And worse is coming.
(answering Reileen's
question)
You should listen to me because I
can teach you how to fight back.

INT. ALCATRAZ - RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

As she speaks, Kovacs tenses, sensing without looking --
FOUR HUGE ORDERLIES have come up behind him.

ORIENTATION WOMAN
A sleeve is replaceable -- but if
your stack is destroyed, you die.
There's no coming back from Real
Death.

An OFFICIOUS SUITED MAN joins the Orderlies. Silhouetted in
the darkened room.

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
I'm Director Sullivan. I don't want
to know your name. Let's go.

KOVACS
(re: Orientation Woman)
Shh, she's just getting to the good
part.

The Director nods to the Orderlies, who step up around Kovacs.

Kovacs looks at the hulking Orderlies -- shrugs, gets up to
go with the Director. As they exit the darkened room --

ORIENTATION WOMAN

(chirpily, smiling)
So avoid blunt force trauma to the
base of the brain, or energy weapons
fired at your head. We recommend
you don't drive heavy machinery or
make any life-altering decisions in
the next few days. Congratulations

INT. ALCATRAZ - CORRIDORS - DAY

Director Sullivan walks with Kovacs through the corridors
past repurposed cell blocks, the barred doors hanging open,
unused.

The Director opens a holoscreen in front of them as they
continue to walk.

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
This is your parole document.
Certifying that your DHF has been
sleeved in a body equipped with
military-grade neurachem, combat
muscle memory, and fitted with an
ONI.

KOVACS
ONI? That sounds like sushi.

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
Ocular Neural Interface.

He hands Kovacs a wristband with a thin, matte black
rectangle, a single blue dot glowing in the middle.

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN (CONT'D)
Here's the remote hub. Thumbprint-
keyed.

Curious, Kovacs slips the wristband on, thumbs the blue dot --
and one of his eyes REFLECTS, a glimmering circle around the
edge of the retina.

POV KOVACS as he sees a range of options around the edges of

his vision -- like a smartphone directly in his eye. The
hub glows with a simple, elegant interface.

Contact lens HUD. Fancy.

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
Those were the specs we were given
by your lease-holder. Bancroft
Industries.

KOVACS
Who?

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
You have questions, ask Bancroft.
You're his problem now, not mine.
But if you don't do what he wants?
You come right back here for the
rest of your sentence.

POV KOVACS as they pass SHACKLED PRISONERS being led past.
He meets the eyes of a PRISONER leaning against the wall
smoking a cigarette as a Guard waits impatiently.

MALE PRISONER
(to Kovacs, shrugs)
Gotta put it in neutral, brother
Let it coast.
(takes a deep drag)
Not like I'm gonna use these lungs
again. So who cares, yeah?

Kovacs looks back to the Director.

KOVACS
Real humane.

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
You commit a crime, you go into
storage and your body belongs to the
state to do what we want with. That's
how it is.

KOVACS
What about rights?

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
Someone like you? You don't have
any.

They walk past ANOTHER PRISONER, sobbing and thrashing as
he's dragged down the corridor.

KOVACS
Good to know.

They reach a pair of opaque glass sliding doors.

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
Bancroft's sent someone to pick you
up in the Re-Meet hall. But I'll
see you again soon.

KOVACS
I'm touched by your faith in me.

DIRECTOR SULLIVAN
I read your file. Felony stack theft
organic damage, murder -- and that's
the part that wasn't redacted. You're
a recidivist. You'll be back, and
you'll be locked up for good, where
you belong. I may not know your
name. But I know people like you.

 

KOVACS
There aren't any other people like
me. Not anymore.

The doors slide open, and Kovacs strides out, leaving the
Orderlies and the baffled Director behind.

INT. ALCATRAZ - RE-MEET HALL - DAY

Kovacs emerges into A VAST OUTER HALL that forms the exit to
the building --

THE RE-MEET HALL. At the opposite end of the hall, automatic
doors slide open to reveal a bright day outside -- Kovacs
glimpses a noisy DEMONSTRATION, SHOUTING and SIGN-WAVING
visible for an instant before the doors slide closed again.

Kovacs glances around -- BENCHES scattered, PEOPLE sitting
or milling. Their eyes on the doors from the clinic.
Nervous.

A trickle of NEWLY-SLEEVED PEOPLE emerge, blinking in the
light, stunned, disoriented.

INT. RESLEEVING FACILITY - HARLAN'S WORLD - FLASHBACK
YOUNG TAKESHI KOVACS (12) and his older sister REILEEN (16)
stand in a crowded Re-Meet hall, older tech but still
recognizable. Young Takeshi's eyes dart back and forth as
he searches the crowd EMERGING from the clinic.

YOUNG TAKESHI
Do you see Dad yet?

YOUNG REILEEN
Not yet. But he'll be here.

Off Young Takeshi, eyes searching --

INT. ALCATRAZ - RE-MEET HALL - DAY

An OLDER JUNKIE WOMAN approaches a FAMILY. They crane past
her, looking at the doors, until she greets the FATHER --

OLD JUNKIE WOMAN

Daddy...?
(off his blank look)
It's me.
FATHER
Cindy?

She starts crying as the Family looks at her in disbelief
verging on horror. The Father grabs a passing SECURITY GUARD --

FATHER (CONT'D)
Our girl was murdered in a hit-and-
run! Law says she gets a free sleeve --
(indicates the Junkie)

Cindy is seven years old!

SECURITY GUARD
(tired, he does this
a lot)
This is what we had in inventory.
You don't like it, you can pay for
an upgrade or put her back in storage.

Kovacs passes by, not staring, but listening, absorbing, as
he goes by --

THE JUNKIE WOMAN clings to the Mother, skinny fingers
clutching desperately.

CINDY
I don't want to go back into the
dark, Mommy.

BACK ON KOVACS, headed for the door -- as A WOMAN in MIRRORED
GLASSES unfolds herself from a bench, lithe as a cat. She
crosses to meet Kovacs. She's Latina, with a beautiful,
unselfconscious strength about her

Getting a good look at Kovacs, she stops short, something
about her reaction to Kovacs seems off for an instant...
nervous, surprised, something.

But she quickly covers. Smiles, chatty.
ORTEGA

ORTEGA (CONT'D)
Welcome to Bay City! You're going
to love it here.

Kovacs extricates his hand. Not loving the enthusiasm. As
they start walking, Ortega chats animatedly --

ORTEGA (CONT'D)

The car's right outside. You're

good to go, right? Since if you had
bags, you left them on another planet
a few centuries ago.

KOVACS
She drives and she's funny. Jackpot.

ORTEGA
You're not even sleeve-sick. I'm
impressed. How long ago did they
decant you?

KOVACS
Long enough.

ORTEGA

(as they move to the

doors)
Keep your head down, there's a little
spirited public debate going on
outside. But don't worry. I doa
little security work on the side.
I'll protect you.

KOVACS
Good. I deplore violence.

They exit through the doors --
EXT. PSYCHASEC ALCATRAZ - DAY

-- Into the middle of a RAUCOUS DEMONSTRATION. Kovacs is
swept into the crowd, an almost surreal immersion into yelling
and jostling bodies, people shoving pamphlets into his hand
and SHOUTING into his face.

TWO GROUPS OF PROTESTORS with holographic placards and
pamphlets, SHOUTING at each other and anyone else who comes
near them. (Think the energy, fervor, and anger of pro-life
and pro-choice demonstrators outside a clinic.)

The ANTI-653 SIDE wear crosses, carry signs saying things
like YOU CANNOT DIGITIZE THE SOUL.

The PRO-653 SIDE carry pamphlets with images of VICTIMS OF
CRIMES.

As Kovacs and Ortega push their way through, we can make out
a little bit through the cacophony: "Stop Resolution 653!"
"You cannot store the soul in a stack!" "Yes on 653!"
"Victims have the right to speak!"

As he and Ortega clear the edge of the demonstration, one of
the Demonstrators gets up in Kovacs' face and YELLS --

DEMONSTRATOR
God is watching! And he will judge
your sins!

KOVACS

That's gonna keep him busy a while.
Ortega takes him to a LIMO that's hovering nearby. She hits
the car alarm, it CHIRPS and the car settles to the ground,
doors opening.
EXT. LIMO (TRAVELING) - DAY
Wide on the city as the limo flies over Bay City.
INT. LIMO (TRAVELING) - DAY
The windows are all opaqued, except for the front windshield,
which is showing mostly sky. Ortega drives, continuing to
talk a mile a minute.

ORTEGA

Sorry about that. Neo-Catholics
they're fucking lunatics, and 653
has them coming out of the woodwork --

Kovacs is glancing at one of the pamphlets, rows of HOLO-

IMAGES of mostly YOUNG WOMEN. YES ON 653: Let The Dead Speak!

Is printed below their faces.

KOVACS
What's 653?

ORTEGA
It's a test case just went through
U.N. court, something about spinning
up murder victims in VR to testify
who killed them. But the church
says once your birth sleeve dies
you're in the hands of God -- spin
up your stack and your soul is damned.

Kovacs is thumbing through the pamphlet -- ANGLE ON ROWS OF
FACES, mostly young beautiful women.

[Note: We don't pay much attention now, but these faces will

KOVACS
So these victims -- their stacks
just stay on ice forever?

ORTEGA

And whoever killed them walks away.
Neo-C's have religious exemption
coding on their stacks, makes it
illegal to spin them back up -- 653
was supposed to change that, but the
court threw it out. The Archdiocese
is happy though -- they say it's
better the murder go unsolved than
the victim's soul go to hell.

(glances at him in

the mirror)
What do you think?

KOVACS
I think no one in the Archdiocese
has ever been murdered. Violent
death will do wonders for your
perspective.

ORTEGA
Is that experience talking? I mean
no offense, but whatever you did, it
must have been pretty bad -- down
for close to five hundred years,
they said. What were you in for?

KOVACS
A little of this, a little of that.
Blew some shit up, killed some people.

ORTEGA
Why?
KOVACS
Some people just need killing.
ORTEGA
Any particular way you decide who
dies?
KOVACS
Depends on the day. Anything can

Ortega seems cheerfully undeterred by the jab. Or oblivious.
It's hard to tell.

ORTEGA
Making conversation's just part of
the job. You work for Bancroft, you
do what you're told. So what does
he want with you?

KOVACS
No fucking clue. I don't even know
who the man is.

ORTEGA
You have been under a while.
Everybody knows Laurens Bancroft.
He's one of the richest men in the
Protectorate, powerful, influential --
he's a Meth, of course --

KOVACS
A what?
ORTEGA
Meth. You know -- "Methuselahs."

From the bible?
EXT. LIMO (TRAVELING) - DAY
The limo moves through a cloud layer --

ORTEGA (0.S.)
"And the days of Methuselah were
nine hundred and sixty-nine years."

-- And the limo emerges ABOVE the clouds, where gleaming
spired buildings pierce the cloud layer and rise high above
it, like palaces built for new and unimaginable gods.

ORTEGA (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Laurens Bancroft is five hundred and
thirty-two years old.

INT. LIMO (TRAVELING) - DAY

Kovacs is craning out to see the skyline through the
windshield.

KOVACS
How can people live that long now?
Back when I come from, resleeve too

ORTEGA
Not if you resleeve right back into
your own body. Growing a single
clone still costs more than most
people make in a lifetime. A lot
more. But the ultrawealthy -- and
that's the Meths -- can afford
multiple clones. They resleeve
themselves, one lifetime after
another.

KOVACS
What about everybody else?

ORTEGA
We scrape by. People get hurt or
get old, they resleeve if they can
in whatever they can afford, but
like you say, can't do it too many
times or...

She makes a "kaboom" motion with her hand at her temple.

ORTEGA (CONT'D)
Maybe that's why Meths like to live
up here, they call it the Aerium.
The rest of us seem pretty small to
them. Our tiny, quick little lives.
But if you were around that long
ago, you must have been alive when
stacks were invented.

KOVACS
Yeah. You got any cigarettes?
ORTEGA
You kidding? That shit will kill
you.
KOVACS

Not a big issue for me right now.
EXT. SUNTOUCH HOUSE - DAY

A huge, luxurious estate rising high above the clouds, the
tallest by far of the many Meth super-high structures. A
tasteful combo of manicured green lawns and gravel. The
sprawling grounds go on for acres, cantilevered over the
abyss of sky that seems to go on forever below.

ORTEGA (V.0.)
What was it like? Before stacks?

Below the soaring, graceful architecture of Suntouch House,
CLOUDS drift like a moving landscape.

ORTEGA
So -- home planet, that kind of thing?
Where were you born?

KOVACS
Not here.

ORTEGA
You want to know why Bancroft thawed
you, I'm wondering the same thing.
What does the man who literally has
everything want with a popsicle from
half a millennia ago?

KOVACS
You really do have a way with words.

ORTEGA
My abuela, she always said, Kristin
you can find a way to talk to anybody.

KOVACS
Especially if they're trapped ina
car with you.

Kovacs looks at the rapidly approaching ground -- there's an
edge to Ortega's voice as she wrestles with the controls --

ORTEGA
Listen, pendejo. I want to help
you. I mean, you're a felon, Bancroft
has you by the brainstem. Do what
he wants or go back on ice. He owns
you... but what the hell does he
want?

KOVACS
Nobody owns me.

Ortega lands the limo with a GRINDING THUMP, tearing up chunks
of lush lawn as she brings the limo to a shuddering halt.

ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- SECURITY GUARDS are rushing
from the house, converging on the limo.

KOVACS (CONT'D)
They don't look very glad to see

Ortega's friendly facade drops. All business now.
ORTEGA
I said I worked security. I didn't

Ortega opens the limo door -- slipping a POLICE BADGE out of
her pocket and onto her belt with one easy move.

Last chance. Just give me a name.

Aren't you going to open my door?

EXT. LIMO - DAY

Kovacs stands on the lawn, as Ortega comes scrambling after
him. Large chunks of grass have been gouged out of the
immaculately groomed lawn by the cruiser.

ORTEGA
You're lying. You can't be who you
say you are. All the Envoys died.

KOVACS
All but one. Sunshine.

SECURITY GUARDS converge around them --

CURTIS
Stop where you are!

ORTEGA
I'm Bay City PD and you know it,
Curtis. So lower your weapons and
tell me where your boss is because I
would like a fucking word.

A GORGEOUS BLONDE WOMAN, early 30's, comes striding through
the Guards. MIRIAM BANCROFT. She's dressed in athletic
clothes that show off a figure toned to perfection, dewy
with sweat.

ORTEGA (CONT'D)
(to Miriam, outraged)
What have you people done?

Miriam recognizes Ortega, and there's no love lost here.

MIRIAM
Lieutenant Ortega. You're trespassing
on private property --
(glances at the limo)
-- And you apparently stole one of
our limos. I could have you shot.

A WHIRR OF ENGINES -- A POLICE CRUISER emerges from the cloud
cover, framing Ortega from behind like a looming bird of

prey --

You could certainly try.

even more of the lawn.

The Police Cruiser disgorges several plainclothes policemen
with MOHAWK HAIRCUTS (varying ages and ethnicities, among
them BAUTISTA, a lifer who has Ortega's back).

MIRIAM (CONT'D)

Why did you bring them here? Isaac
was supposed to drive you --

ORTEGA
As in your son, Isaac?

Bautista pulls A YOUNG MAN, maybe 19, out of the cruiser
He looks bleary and sick -- meet ISAAC BANCROFT.

BAUTISTA
We picked him up on a DUI.

Miriam hurries to her son's side, he pulls away sullenly.

MIRIAM
Isaac, what were you doing drinking?

ISAAC
I'm not a goddamned chauffeur

MIRIAM
Go inside.

I'm going to report you, this is

aware of the effect of her looks.

MIRIAM
What are you waiting for? Get inside --

KOVACS
I'm not great at following directions.
Or taking orders. Or really anything
that involves a chain of command.

Miriam pulls back on the snark. She's not used to being
talked back to. Maybe she likes it.

MIRIAM
Of course. We're just all so tense,
since... I'm Miriam Bancroft, we

haven't been properly introduced.
Please forgive me.

They head inside --
INT. SUNTOUCH HOUSE - HALL - MOMENTS LATER

-- Where Miriam leads him past A CRUMBLING BLUE STONE TREE
(a SONGSPIRE) twined like a living sculpture up the walls
topmost branches veining the ceiling. At once majestic and
incredibly fragile.

KOVACS
Shouldn't that be in a museum?

She turns and smiles at him. Sex and innocence at once.

MIRIAM
Definitely. But I have a weakness
for Elder Civilization artifacts. I
collect them. Among other things.

KOVACS
It must have cost a fortune to ship
it here.

MIRIAM

A few fortunes. And several lifetimes
as well. But cost was no object.

Miriam gently trails her fingers down one of the tree's

branches -- and it makes a musical sound, like delicate bells
of chiming glass. An alien, unimaginable sound.

over everything, incredibly complex and massive. SONGSPIRE
CHIMES ringing over the city in a rich natural melody.

Light from 3 suns streams down over broken, crumbling spires --
and the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING.

PAN DOWN to see jury-rigged STRUCTURES built into the ruins.
People working, living. A REBELLION BASE in hiding, including
ENVOYS -- among them, 0.G. KOVACS and the RECRUITS we saw
before. Body armor, ragtag equipment. Talking, working,
playing with the kids and families who have sought refuge
here.

This is the only Songspire on Earth.

MIRIAM
No one is sure what they are, even

programmed to continue expanding.

She holds the door open for him. He's on his own from here.
He opens the door, sees her standing under the curving

-- A beautifully appointed library. Kovacs takes in the
details of the place, the shelves filled with books. Takes
one slim volume from a place of pride: Ethics on the
Precipice, by Quellcrist Falconer

He opens it -- the book is handwritten. Something in his
face as he holds the book... pain. Anger. Sadness.

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
It's a strange thing, holding her
book in your hand, isn't it?

BANCROFT has entered the room: 50's, handsome, athletic,
exuding power and confidence --

-- And without warning, Kovacs turns and SLAMS Bancroft up
against the wall.

KOVACS
Where did you get this?!

Bancroft looks surprisingly calm. Not even breathing hard.
Meets Kovacs' eyes without a shred of fear

BANCROFT
I bought it at auction.

KOVACS
It's her handwriting.

Bancroft sweeps open a holo-window in the air next to them.

BANCROFT (CONT'D)
This is a full pardon, signed by the
President of the Protectorate,
reducing your sentence to time served.
I've opened a line of credit in your
name, DNA trace accessible, to cover
all your expenses. When your
investigation is done, you may keep
that sleeve, or choose another to

I keep it for protection stored ina

(shakes his head)
I'm afraid it was completely
destroyed. RD'd, as they say.
Thoughts?

KOVACS
Only one. Remote storage backup.
I'd guess offsite, secure and secret.
Bancroft goes to a circular staircase, Kovacs follows.

BANCROFT
Let me show you something.

EXT. SUNTOUCH HOUSE - CROW'S NEST BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

They come out onto a high crow's nest-like balcony. The
view is PANORAMIC, over the whole estate and the ocean below.

BANCROFT
When I was younger, I used to come
up here when I had decisions to make,
or difficulties to face. I would
think about the ancient explorers
back when one could spend a lifetime
pursuing the secrets of the Earth
the ocean, the stars...

There are RELICS OF EXPLORATION all around the room -- a
SEXTANT, an ASTROLABE, hand-drawn MAPS of the Earth, more
MAPS OF THE HEAVENS, along with TELESCOPE IMAGES of distant
stars and galaxies, like paintings made of light.

But the room has an unlived-in feel, a light coating of dust
covering everything.

BANCROFT (CONT'D)
But I haven't been here in years.
The age of adventurers and explorers
is over.

Bancroft stops in front of AN ANTIQUE BRASS TELESCOPE, bolted
on the railing. A digital keypad below it, wired to the
telescope. Dust disturbed here, a few fingermarks.

Bancroft keys in coordinates on the pad; as the motor attached
to the telescope WHIRS, repositioning its angle --

BANCROFT (CONT'D)
(as the telescope
comes to a stop)
Go ahead -- tell me what you see.

Kovacs puts his eye to the viewfinder: sees AN ANGULAR METAL
OBJECT floating against the backdrop of the darkening sky.

KOVACS
Protectorate satellite. Looks
military grade.

BANCROFT

It is. But it's not the
Protectorate's. It's mine. Every
48 hours my stack is automatically
needlecast to it. Foolproof backup.

(a beat)
When Miriam found me, my last backup
was already downloading into this
cloned sleeve. Whoever wanted me
dead must have had a plan for
disabling the backup -- but it failed.

KOVACS
So your... current self doesn't have
any memory of what happened?

BANCROFT
The last thing I remember is being
in my lawyer's office, going over
trade deals in the Orion belt.
Whoever killed me pulled the trigger
10 minutes before my backup went
through --

KOVACS
Which means your memories of those
48 hours are gone.

BANCROFT
Lost completely.

32 EXT. SUNTOUCH GROUNDS - DAY
Kovacs and Bancroft walk on the grounds of the estate.

BANCROFT
Someone wants me dead. Permanently.
They will try again, and next time
they might well succeed. Unless you
find them first.

KOVACS
For all I know, you did try to slag
yourself and just botched the job.

For the first time, we see the steel behind Bancroft's
pleasant manner.

BANCROFT
Mr. Kovacs. I have lived through
the Corporate Wars, the collapse and
rebuilding of my industrial and
trading interests, brought 48 children
into the world and survived the real
deaths of two of them. I am not the
kind of man to take my own life, and
even if I were, I would not have
bungled it in this fashion. If I
meant to die, I would be dead.

Kovacs looks into Bancroft's eyes as he speaks.
KOVACS
I've heard you out. But I don't

want your money. Or your pardon.
I'll take eternity on ice, thanks.

KOVACS
You know what regular people do when
they get RD'd? Nothing, because
they're dead. Your world, your
problems. Doesn't have anything to
do with me.

Bancroft regards Kovacs. Thinking.

BANCROFT
Take a day, Mr. Kovacs. Go out
into the world. Breathe air into
your lungs, feel the wind on your
skin. Remember what it is to be
alive.

As Kovacs turns to go --

BANCROFT (CONT'D)
And please. Take this.

He hands him the Quellcrist book.
BANCROFT (CONT'D)
Like everything else I'm offering...
it's yours. If you want it.
Off Kovacs, looking down at the book in his hand --
EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

The famous bridge rises into the foggy sky, ocean water
lapping at the massive pylons at its base.

BUBBLEFAB HOUSING has been built into the spaces of the
cables, and the bridge itself is covered with haphazard
sprawled structures.

ON THE SHORELINE, FIND KOVACS looking up at the bridge from
the edge of the water. His pants rolled up. The sea lapping
at his feet as he walks into the water, ankle-deep... and
closes his eyes.

PRELAP THE SOUND OF TWO CHILDREN LAUGHING AND SHOUTING --

and the buzz of inner-city life, as we --

EXT. STREETS OF BAY CITY - DAY

Kovacs moves through the streets. Looking at the PEOPLE
their clothes and languages a JUMBLE of global styles and
polyglot patois. A street market slum feel, but yet still
vibrant with life and energy.

It's a layered, jumbled lower city, crowded with neon and
holographic ads, a hive-like collection of humanity crowded
on itself, jury-rigged flimsy buildings haphazardly
constructed in the interstices of old architecture.

EXT. BAY CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Find Kovacs stopped in front of a TATTOO PARLOR, looking at
the window thoughtfully. Twining designs rendered in every
color, several people being tatted inside with strange tools.

A rail-thin JUNKIE DEALER stands in the alley next to the
Tattoo parlor, doing business. He's wearing a neon-bright
"Hello Unicorn" backpack, Japanese young-girl style, pulling
several multicolored eyedroppers out of it, slipping them to
a CUSTOMER who pays by swiping his thumb on a black matte
rectangle in the Dealer's hand.

The Dealer looks Kovacs over. Sizing up a potential customer

JUNKIE DEALER
Inking up a new sleeve, it's like
putting old furniture in a new house,
right? Makes it feel more like home.

Kovacs turns away from the window.

KOVACS
Not gonna be in here long enough to
customize the place.

Kovacs notices small, squat MACHINES scuttle by on the
sidewalks on spider-like legs -- people MOVE ASIDE around
them, annoyed.

Kovacs continues walking, they whir past on scuttling legs --

-- And HOLOGRAMS flicker to life around him as he's in range,
then abruptly de-rez as he keeps moving, pixels dissolving
like watercolors in the rain.

Like walking through rooms of smoke, that form and dissipate
one after another --

WOMEN barely clothed, dancing sinuously. MEN, square-jawed,
shirtless, a gay man's dream. And then A STUNNING WOMAN,
filmy gauze barely covering her body, full lips whispering --

WOMAN IN HOLOGRAM
The Houses, the finest in intimate
experiences the Earth has to offer.

She drops to her knees in front of Kovacs --

Kovacs sidesteps her, keeps going, the image dissolves, giving
way to --

IMAGES of a CHARISMATIC NEWS REPORTER, SANDY KIM, standing
in front of sleazy establishments with PROSTITUTES coming in
and out of the buildings behind her

SANDY KIM

caught in a love nest with his
boyfriend. Watch me, Sandy Kim, on
Uniwave One, for the exclusive footage
of their tryst, and the heartbreak

Kovacs puts his head down, strides out of the swirling images

Kovacs' instincts overcome him, he drops into a combat crouch
his neurachem FLARES in a glow beneath his skin, different
and brighter than what we saw in the opening -- he swings a
PUNCH --

-- And his blow SLAMS into something, concrete SHATTERS around
him as --

you?

A hand SLAPS something on the back of his neck -- Kovacs
WHIRLS, stops himself an INCH from hitting Ortega --

He wants me to solve his murder.

You mean he wants you to investigate

KOVACS
Because you didn't. Or couldn't.
Or won't. It was your case, wasn't

So the whole "just-keep-talking"

Fine, you talk. Tell me why Bancroft

It's called Envoy Intuition.

related... and then suddenly they
are.

I'm not the one with the problem.
He got me reprimanded when I couldn't
find his "killer." Tried to screw
with my career, which means with my
life. And he's still doing it.

KOVACS
You're saying you didn't deserve it?

ORTEGA

I polygraphed the wife at her own
insistence. She passed without a
twitch. We chased down every lead,
checked on his friends and his
enemies, people with opportunity and
motive, and we always came back to
the same thing. He locked himself
in his study and offed himself.

KOVACS
And just conveniently forgot that
he'd be resleeved in less than an

silhouettes across bloodstained tiles. No natural light.

A bizarre mix of Grand Guignol theater, gothic architecture,
and high-tech sleek innovation. Again, no one here. Utterly
empty.

bleak avatar of the HOTEL A.I., a sort of Eeyore of the

His back to Dimitri, his eyes dart swiftly around the room --

KOVACS
It's not voodoo, which by the way
absolutely is bullshit, it's a form
of subliminal pattern recognition --

Dimitri shoves him forward -- Kovacs sprawls to the floor.

DIMITRI
Don't play with me.

ON KOVACS as he gets to his feet, WHISPERS rising in his
ears, as we INTERCUT WITH FRAGMENTS OF EARLIER MOMENTS
lightning-fast FLASH TO --

NOSY LADY ON TRAIN
. Hardwired to want guests...

POE
Cabled and enabled...

NOSY LADY ON TRAIN
Like sleeping with a stalker...

BACK TO -- as Kovacs spots A HINGED PANEL in the ceiling --

same ENVOY-VISION we saw with Sarah, POV KOVACS as he
instantly SKETCHES IN a recessed OPENING behind the panel --

KOVACS

(grunts as he fights)
I'm good, thanks.

Kovacs HEADBUTTS Dimitri viciously -- Dimitri staggers back.
The moment he's clear of Kovacs, laser dots BLOOM all over
him --

-- And Kovacs snatches Dimitri's gun off the floor and SLAMS
into Dimitri, PINNING him against the wall. Blocking the
hotel's shot with his own body, targeting laser on his back.

KOVACS (CONT'D)
You're not getting off that easy.
Who sent you?
Dimitri smiles. Teeth smeared with his own blood.
DIMITRI
You're not what I expected, Kovacs.
My mistake.
Dimitri PUNCHES Kovacs low in the kidney, twists free --

DIMITRI (CONT'D)
It won't happen again.

-- He runs toward the cannons, opening his arms with a ROAR!

POE
Eat lead, motherfucker

KOVACS
Wait -- !

 

The guns THUNDER, slamming Dimitri back in a hail of lead --
he DROPS, body riddled with bullets. The guns go SILENT.

Kovacs, bloodied and clothes torn, looks accusingly at Poe,
who shrugs insouciantly -- as the elevator DINGS.

POE
Your room beckons.
(cocks his head as if
listening)
If you'd like to freshen up before
the constabulary arrives.

Kovacs looks down at his bloodied self, the wrecked lobby.

KOVACS
I'm good.

ORTEGA (PRELAPPED)
What the fuck are you still doing
here?

INT. THE RAVEN HOTEL - LATER

SAME ANGLE on the wrecked lobby -- but now POLICEMEN move
through the carnage, taking SAMPLES from the bodies, as ORTEGA
comes striding through the lobby toward Kovacs, who's standing
at the bar.

ORTEGA
You get hit?

KOVACS
I'm touched by your concern.

ORTEGA
What happened to getting laid, a
meal, and re-stacking for eternity?

KOVACS
I got interrupted.

She looks over the bodies on the ground.

ORTEGA
Who the fuck are these guys?

Disgusted, Kovacs grabs a blood-spotted glass, wipes it off,
pours a drink --

KOVACS
I didn't know them. But they knew
me.

ORTEGA
They called you by name? You're
sure?

KOVACS

I was there. It was hard to miss.

One of the MOHAWKS comes up, with a small handheld SCANNER.
A slot on the top to slide in DNA SAMPLES. Ortega reads --

ORTEGA

Four of them are just local muscle...
(whistles)

But the leader. That sleeve is
registered to Dimitri Kadmin,
professional assassin out of
Vladivostok. Otherwise known as
Dimi the Twin. Does a lot of work
for the Yakuza.

ORTEGA (CONT'D)
(to Mohawk 1)
You run it?

MOHAWK JENKINS
Ulan Bator registry, boss.

ORTEGA
The capitol of black market DH
downloads. We've got the bastard.

KOVACS
Got him for what?

ORTEGA
Double-sleeving. Dimitri isn't very
trusting. So he makes an illegal
copy of himself and downloads it
into a black market sleeve.
(to Mohawk Bautista)
Excise it.

Mohawk Bautista nods, flicks a knife out, kicking Dimitri's
body over and crouching by his neck.

ORTEGA (CONT'D)
We hold onto his stack, sooner or
later we catch the other version of
him out there and then -- he's done.

KOVACS
What's the penalty?

ORTEGA
Protectorate-mandated erasure. Total
personality destruction.

KOVACS

You feed his stack to the shredder?
ORTEGA

Somehow society will weather the

loss.

Mohawk Bautista is struggling with his knife, trying to get
the stack out --

ORTEGA (CONT'D)
(impatiently)
Let me do it.

Ortega bends over Dimitri's corpse, knee on his back to steady
it as she flicks a knife in between vertebrae in his neck.

With a sharp blow to the skull, Ortega pulls Dimitri's stack --
mangled by gunfire.

MOHAWK JENKINS
It's fragged. We can get a positive
ID, but can't spin him up to
interrogate.

ORTEGA
Goddamn it.
(to Poe)
You couldn't just disable them?

POE
(coldly)
No gesture is too extreme when it
comes to the defense of a guest

ORTEGA
Enough firepower to bring down a
small aircraft.

POE

Commensurate with the threat to my
business. Should I temper my
enthusiasm for my first guest in
five decades?

(raises an eyebrow)
Perhaps if you'd ever chosen these
halls for an assignation --

ORTEGA
(snaps)
That's enough.

KOVACS
So Dimitri's an expensive hired
killer...

ORTEGA
Top of the line. For a scumbag.

KOVACS
Then Bancroft didn't commit suicide.

ORTEGA
Right, cause you're so well-liked.

KOVACS
I'm disliked plenty. On other worlds
five centuries ago. I don't merit
this kind of hit -- unless someone
wants to stop me looking into
Bancroft's death.

I can find a way to arrest you for
this, Kovacs. Organic Damage and
Real Death, 6 hours out of the tank --

 

KOVACS
You know what, Ortega? You can arrest
me, RD me, fuck me, or fuck off.
Your choice.

Poe opens the elevator doors with a ding. Kovacs gets in
looking back at the wide shot of Ortega standing in the bloody
carnage of the lobby.

INT. THE RAVEN HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Poe appears in the elevator behind Kovacs.

POE
A scintillating evening!
KOVACS
Jesus! Don't just -- show up like

that. Can't you knock or something?

POE
It renews me to partner with a
presence like yourself.

KOVACS
We are not partners.

POE
Perhaps it's time for the consoling
touch of femininity you requested
earlier?

KOVACS
No.

POE
(doesn't take the hint)

I can arrange for a slattern, a woman
of business, a feral virago, whatever
you fancy. I know one courtesan
with eyes bright as day, hair black
as night, a briefcase that she carries
filled with the tools of carnal
delight -- congress with her is a
poignant reminder that the peak of
ecstasy is called "the little death."
Or so I'm told.

POE (CONT'D)
In the decades since the AI hotels
emptied out, I chose this persona to
study the ache of human melancholy,
and it's taught me that --

KOVACS
Have you ever heard of personal space?
As in, give me some? Right the fuck
now?

POE
You are singularly ungrateful and I
must say, somewhat rude. But asa
hotelier, I recognize the guest is
always right.

KOVACS
Recognize it somewhere not in my
face.

Poe sighs disconsolately, vanishes. Kovacs pushes the button
on the elevator that says "Roof Access."

EXT. THE RAVEN HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

ON THE Hello Unicorn backpack, open on the roof, lit by the
pulsing glow of the neon Raven Holocast.

He tilts back his head, uses a thin disposable EYEDROPPER to
drip a half-gas, half-liquid into his eyes.

His eyes seem to STEAM for an instant, then go back to normal --
smoking as he pops a few more pills. Eyes dilated. Feet
swinging out over the abyss.

KOVACS
He was right. Whatever it is, this
is some unspeakably good shit.

He takes out a pulse gun -- we recognize the gun Dimitri
pulled on him. Kovacs looks at it. Then up at the sky.

Then, suddenly, puts it under his jaw. Aimed at the back of
his neck, the base of his brain.

QUELL (0.S.)
Is that really what you want to do
with your only night on Earth?

WIDEN to see that he's not alone on the roof -- QUELL is

standing behind him. Wind blowing her hair from her face,
wearing her Stronghold battle gear, desert robes fluttering.

For the first time, we see Kovacs' confident facade crack
just a little... to see the yawning, endless pain beneath.

KOVACS
I miss you so much.

QUELL
I know, Tak.

KOVACS
I don't know how to be in this world
without you.

QUELL
I'm here.

KOVACS
You're dead.

QUELL
But you're not.

KOVACS
I don't have to go back on ice.
This... right now... this is my only
chance. I can make it stop. End
it, for good. Blow out my stack and
make it all go away...

QUELL
If you do that, it won't all go away.
Just you.

(beat)

Tak. Look at me.

Kovacs turns, meets Quell's eyes -- but instead of seeing
the roof, he sees --

THE RUINS OF STRONGHOLD, bodies strewn everywhere, sprawled
in a silent, unmoving tableaux of death.

And among those bodies, twisted and bodies torn, eyes staring
sightlessly: VIDAURA, GOMEZ, JIMMY DESOTO... and REILEEN.

The Envoy trainees that we saw with Quell -- the men and
women who were Kovacs' closest friends, and his sister.

Quell is the only living thing in the landscape of slaughter.

QUELL (CONT'D)
I've been gone a long time.

KOVACS
I want to be with you.

QUELL
You never could lie for shit.

She comes forward, sits beside him. Both on the roof now,
next to each other.

KOVACS
You think I'm lying?

QUELL
I think you're leaving something

out. How did you feel in that lobby?
Fighting for your life?

KOVACS
(a beat, then admits)
Good.

QUELL
Here's what you learn when someone
tries to kill you: you're still alive.
Take it personally. Do what I taught
you. Fight back.

Slowly, he brings the gun up to his jaw again --

KOVACS
I'm not sure I can anymore.

She puts her hand over his, gently lowering the gun with
their hands intertwined over it.

QUELL
If you love me, you don't get to be
with me by fucking giving up. You
survive.

KOVACS
Why? To help out these people and
their fucked-up world...?

QUELL
Do what you were born to do. What I
trained you to do. Make things
change.

KOVACS
By saving a Meth fuckhead?

QUELL
By doing whatever you have to do to
get your life back.

KOVACS
Without you.

KOVACS
Never. You hear me. Not ever

QUELL
Then don't.

She gets up, moves behind him.

QUELL (CONT'D)

There's more here than you're willing
to see. It's not the threat. It's
the unanswered question. The mystery
that needs to be solved, the box

that needs to be unlocked. Envoys
take what is offered, Tak. Take

this chance, and don't look back

He turns to look at her again -- but she's vanished.

Kovacs curls in on himself, as if he's been punched. The
loss of her, even after those few moments, palpably painful
as a knife to the gut.

After a moment, Kovacs stands. Spreads his arms against the
night sky, as if he could jump from the roof.

From behind, we see him silhouetted against the endless lights
of skyline. Like a GUARDIAN watching over the city below.

EXT. STREETS OF BAY CITY - NIGHT

We're back at the TATTOO PARLOR, garish lights screaming
into the dark. Through the window -- KOVACS in the seat.

KOVACS (V.0.)
Envoys weren't commandos, not exactly.
We weren't terrorists, either. We
were soldiers who turned our backs
on immortality to try to save humanity
from itself.

INT. TATTOO PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
Kovacs has his arm turned up, as the TATTOO ARTIST uses
something like a tiny vibrating arc-welder to cut his flesh --

but instead of black ink, he pours white-hot liquid
"illuminum" into his skin.

KOVACS (V.0.)
Learned techniques of honing pure
mind that let us move between
battlefield planets like ghosts,
from one sleeve to another, digital
guerrillas striking and then melting
back into the electronic sleet

The tattoo takes form like liquid opal in his skin, gem-bright
depth and sheen.

KOVACS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
So it should have been easy for me
to die. I'd done it before.

It sizzles against his skin, then cools instantly, taking
form --

KOVACS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
But I'd seen her. Heard her voice,
watched her move in the moonlight

The Artist continues molding and shaping, carving the form
of the tattoo -- the OUROBOROS.

KOVACS (V.0O.) (CONT'D)
And real or imagined, if the one way
I could be with her was to survive,
then I was going to do it

Kovacs types something into the hub strapped to his wrist.
The ONI in his eye GLEAMS, showing it's activated. He's
talking with someone, we just can't see who.

KOVACS (CONT'D)
(into the phone)
Yeah, it's Kovacs. I'll take the
case.

LINGER ON THE OUROBOROS TATTOO, as the tail is carved to
reach the mouth, and the tattoo is completed --

SLAM TO BLACK.
