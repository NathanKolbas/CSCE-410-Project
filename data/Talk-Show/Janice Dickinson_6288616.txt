SLIDE SHOW - OVER BLACK

The whirring sound of an old-fashioned slide projector. Each
image that appears is small, at the center of the screen.
They are dusty photographs, relics from another time.

NARRATOR
Emily Dickinson was born in 1830,
in Amherst, Massachusetts.

A picture of Emily Dickinson appears. (There’s only one known
photo of her in existence, so it’s this one.)

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
She lived throughout her life in
her father’s house.

A picture of the big, yellow Dickinson Homestead.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Near the end of her life, she
rarely left her own room.

A picture of Emily’s bedroom: sparse, Puritanical.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Aside from a few anonymous verses,
she remained unpublished.

A picture of one of Emily’s poems, scrawled in pencil, ona
scrap of paper.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
When she died, her poems were
discovered.

More poems. Little hand-sewn books of poems. The slides start
moving faster.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Some of the strangest, most
fascinating poems ever written.

More, more. Faster, faster. There are poems on envelopes.
Notecards. Candy wrappers.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Almost two thousand of them.
Hidden. In a maid’s trunk.
The slide reel appears to burn itself out. Darkness.

CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP - A GIRL’S FACE

The face fills the frame. And looks directly at us. The skin
is pale, luminous. The lips are wry, slightly twisted. The
eyebrows, rakish. And the eyes - the eyes are so intelligent,
it’s scary.

A hand comes to the lips. The hand holds a cigarette. This
girl is SMOKING.

EXT. AMHERST COLLEGE, 1855 - DAY

The girl, in a WHITE DRESS, leans against the brick wall of a
college building, smoking a rolled cigarette.

It is springtime. The green lawns of the college are
immaculate. A BUMBLEBEE buzzes on a clover.

The girl takes another drag, and exhales a perfect SMOKE
CIRCLE.

Suddenly, a MAN rides up, on one of those Victorian-era
BICYCLES. He’s a stiff, gray-haired professor-type, in a long
black coat.

He nearly topples off his bike when he sees the girl.

MAN
(indignant)
What’s this?! Women are not allowed
on the grounds of the college. And
smoking?! The very idea... I’11 put
a stop to this. Who are you?

The girl looks at him, ironic, unruffled.

GIRL
I’m nobody. Who are you.

The man sputters.

MAN
I, young lady, am the prefect. And
I‘1l give you one more chance,
before I have you dragged from this
campus by force. Identify yourself!
Who are you?!

The girl, slowly, takes another drag. We push in on her face
again, as she answers.

GIRL
I’m Emily Fucking Dickinson.
MUSIC. Specifically, Kendrick Lamar, “King Kunta” (2015).
This twenty-first century anthem of black empowerment
becomes, for now, an anthem of Victorian white-girl
empowerment. What, you have a problem with that?

EXT. WOODS - DAY

With Kendrick as her underscore, EMILY DICKINSON, 25 years
old, struts through the woods of 19th-century Amherst.

KENDRICK
“Bitch where you when I was
walkin’? / Now I run the game, got
the whole world talkin’...”

As she walks, and walks, the weeds and brambles whip at the
bottom of her dress, getting it dirty. The wind reddens her
cheeks. Untidies her hair.
KENDRICK (CONT’D)
“Everybody wanna cut the legs off
him / Black man, take no losses...”
She looks exhilarated. But also like she could kill somebody.

TITLE: DICKINSON

INT. EMILY’S BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN

Four a.m. in the mid-19th century -- dark and quiet as shit.
Emily wakes up in her small, creaky bed. She throws off the
covers.

She grabs a shawl, lights a kerosene lamp, and sits down at
her tiny, cramped writing desk. Takes out a pencil and a
scrap of paper. Thinks. Chews her pencil.

Then -- she gets into it. Writing. Writing. Lightning
striking in her brain.

And then -- an interruption. A KNOCK on the door. From
outside, her sister’s voice.

LAVINIA (0.S.)
Emily! Emily, wake up!

Emily crouches, like a tiger, then explodes.

EMILY
What the fuck!

She slams down her pencil, bangs over to the door, opens it.
4.

Her sister, LAVINIA, 22, plump and curvy with a gap between
her teeth, is standing there, holding a BUCKET.

LAVINIA
You have to go fetch water.

Emily glares at her.

EMILY
It is four in the god damn morning,
Lavinia. I am writing. Wri-ting.

LAVINIA
Mother says you have to go. I did
it yesterday.

EMILY
Why doesn’t Austin do it?
LAVINIA
Austin’s a boy, Emily! He doesn’t

do chores!
Emily shakes her head.

EMILY
This is such bullshit.

Lavinia shrugs, and hands Emily the bucket.

EXT. PATH FROM THE WELL - SUNRISE

Emily trudges back from the well with her bucket full of
water, as the first light of day appears in the sky.

She half-whispers, still trying to puzzle out her new poem.

EMILY
(under her breath)
“Because I could not stop for
Death”... “Because I could not stop
for Death”...

She thinks up another line, and stops dead in her tracks.
Half the water sloshes out of the bucket. She doesn’t care.

She puts the bucket down. Takes a little pencil and paper out
of her dress pocket. She scribbles.

EMILY (V.O.)
“Because I could not stop for Death
- He kindly stopped for me.”
Up in a tree, a BIRD chirps. Emily smiles.

EXT. DICKINSON HOMESTEAD - MORNING

An establishing shot of the BIG YELLOW HOUSE where Emily
Dickinson spent almost all of her life. A pristine, imposing
New England mansion, set amongst woods and hayfields. The
window up on the right is Emily’s room.

This is Main Street, Amherst, 1855 -- not exactly bustling.
But still, any action that goes on in the town, the
Dickinsons are right in the thick of it.

Now, Emily emerges from the path, with her bucket, and enters
through a SIDE DOOR.

INT. KITCHEN —- MORNING

Emily’s MOTHER, Mrs. Dickinson (think Laurie Metcalf), and
Lavinia are already hard at work in the overheated kitchen.

Mrs. Dickinson tends to a RAGING FIRE on the hearth, while
Lavinia PLUCKS A CHICKEN. As Emily enters, Mrs. Dickinson
attacks her.

MOTHER
We needed that water an hour ago!
Where have you - oh, Emily, this
bucket’s half-empty! You let it all
spill out! Oh, you’re a useless
girl. Useless!

Emily rolls her eyes. This is obviously a familiar routine.

EMILY
Can't we just get a maid?

Mrs. Dickinson is appalled.

MOTHER
Over my dead body.

EMILY
But why? We can afford one.

MOTHER
It’s not for you to say what we can
and can’t afford, you wicked thing.

EMILY
We own six fricking horses, Mom. We
can get a maid.
MOTHER

When your father married me, I said
he was getting the best housewife
in all Hampshire County. No - in
all New England! I’d rather scrub
the skin off my fingers than hire a
maid. And I’m bringing you girls up
to be just like me.

EMILY
But--

MOTHER
(cutting her off)
You're going to make a good
housewife someday, Emily Dickinson,
if it kills me.

Mrs. Dickinson claps some flour on her hands, and begins
kneading a huge pile of dough.

MOTHER (CONT'D)
Now - you need to go get dressed.
We have another gentleman coming to

see you.

LAVINIA
Ooh! A gentleman?!

EMILY
Mom, no --

MOTHER

He'll be here quite soon. So go
upstairs and prepare yourself. This
man could very well be your
husband.

LAVINIA
So romantic!

EMILY
(dark)
I wonder what hideous deformity
this one will have.

MOTHER
Don’t be rude. And you better not
pull any stunts like you did last
time.

EMILY
I made an offering.
MOTHER
You dropped a dead mouse in that
poor man’s lap.

EMILY
Yes. Like a cat.

MOTHER
You are not a cat, Emily!

EMILY
No. Tragically, I am a woman.

Emily exits, but not before grabbing one of the FRESH SCONES
her mother has just pulled from the oven.

MOTHER
Those scones are for the suitor!

Emily's gone. Mother shakes her head. Lavinia looks annoyed.

LAVINIA
Why don’t I get to have suitors?

MOTHER
I’m not trying to marry you off.
You’re good at housework.
LAVINIA
So I have to die an old maid
because I can fetch water?!

MOTHER
Life isn’t fair, Lavinia.

The Dickinson women go back to work.

INT. EMILY’S BEDROOM - DAY

Emily, in her room, is sneaking another chance to work on her
poem. She sits at her tiny desk, and scribbles. She hasn’t
changed her clothes or brushed her hair or anything.

From downstairs, she hears Lavinia screaming.

LAVINIA (0.S.)
Emily! He’s here!

Frustrated, she slams her pencil down.
INT. PARLOR - DAY

Mrs. Dickinson sits in the parlor drinking tea with the
suitor, GEORGE. George is gawky, but cute -- a Jesse
Eisenberg type. Mrs. Dickinson sips her tea, embarrassed.

MOTHER
She’1ll be down in a moment. I do
apologize.

GEORGE
(awkward)
Oh - no worries.

Now Emily makes her entrance. She has brushed her hair so
that it all HANGS IN FRONT OF HER FACE. Like Cousin It. She
looks like a woman walking backwards. She looks insane.
She walks into the room slowly, her hair blocking her vision.
EMILY
(dramatically)
Hello.
Mrs. Dickinson gasps.

MOTHER
Emily - cut that out!

Emily laughs, and flips her hair back, so she can see. Then
she looks at the suitor. She recognizes him.

EMILY

Oh, for fuck’s sake. George?!
GEORGE

Hey, Emily.

Mrs. Dickinson is baffled.

MOTHER
You have already made my daughter’s
acquaintance?

EMILY
Mom, this is George. He’s in the
lit club with Austin. We hang out
all the time.

Mrs. Dickinson’s hand is trembling on her teacup.
MOTHER
Well. I was just telling George
here what an excellent wife you
will be. How frugal and punctilious
you are in all your duties--

EMILY
Oh, yeah - I’m a real catch.

Emily flops down in an armchair and, literally, lights a
cigarette. Mrs. Dickinson almost faints.

MOTHER
You put that out right now!

EMILY
(exhaling)
George, can I talk to you for a
second? Outside?

George leaps up, eager for a chance to be alone with her.

GEORGE
Totally!

EMILY
Cool. Mom - we’ll be on the porch.
Try to relax.
Emily heads outside. George follows. Mrs. Dickinson looks up
at the ceiling, praying for help.
EXT. SIDE PORCH - DAY

Emily leans against the porch railing, and takes out another
cigarette. George scrambles to light it for her.

EMILY
What are you even doing here,
George?

GEORGE

I just wanted to see you. (Beat.) I
always want to see you.

EMILY
You know I’m not going to marry
you, right?

GEORGE
Never say never, Emily. Like you
wrote in your poem - “I dwell in

Possibility.”
10.

EMILY
Nice. I love when people quote me.

GEORGE
Why won’t you marry me? I’m not
good enough for you?

EMILY
You don’t understand - I’m not
going to marry anyone.

GEORGE
That’s not what your mother says.

EMILY
I have one purpose on this earth,
George - and it is to become a
great writer. A husband would put a
stop to that.

GEORGE
I wouldn't.

EMILY
You say that now, but little by
little, you would.
Emily stubs out her cigarette. George grabs her by the wrist.

GEORGE
I’m madly in love with you.

EMILY
Well - too bad.

GEORGE
Is there someone else?

EMILY
Actually - yes.

GEORGE
Who is he? I’1l kill him.

EMILY
You can’t kill him. He is Death.

GEORGE
What?
11.

EMILY
That's right. I’m in love with
Death.

FLASH TO:

EXT. FRONT WALKWAY - NIGHT

A black carriage pulled by white horses rolls up in front of
the Homestead, in the moonlight. Emily waits for it, at the
bottom of the steps.

EMILY (V.O.)
He takes me out for a carriage
ride, every night. He’s a total
gentleman. A silver fox. Sexy as
hell.

The carriage stops, and a HAND reaches out. Emily TAKES THE
HAND, and climbs in. The carriage rolls away.

BACK TO:

EXT. SIDE PORCH - CONTINUOUS
George shakes his head, in amazement.
GEORGE
You're such a fucking weirdo. Why
am I so attracted to you?

Emily smiles at him.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
I'd do anything for you.

EMILY
Well... there is - something - you
could do.

GEORGE
Name it.

Emily reaches into the pocket of her dress.

EMILY
You're still editor of the lit mag,
right?

GEORGE

Well - co-editor - but yes.
12.

Emily pulls out a piece of paper, and hands it to him.

He nods.

EMILY
I want you to publish this.

GEORGE
Whoa! Awesome! You're finally gonna
let me publish one of your poems?!

EMILY
Well - I’ve rewritten it forty
times - I’m still not sure it’s
ready, but...

GEORGE
This is perfect timing. We have a
little space in our newest issue -
I can sneak this in. It goes to
print tomorrow.

EMILY
Really?! Tomorrow?!

EMILY (CONT'D)
Okay - but wait.

GEORGE
What is it?

EMILY
You can’t print my name.

GEORGE
What? Why not?

Emily looks over her shoulder. Paranoid.

EMILY
My father doesn’t approve of women
publishing.

GEORGE
Oh, come on. That’s stupid. You’re
a genius, Emily - he has to approve
of that.

A TAPPING on the windowpane interrupts them. Emily looks and
sees Lavinia inside, waving at her to hurry up and come in.

EMILY
Couldn’t you put my initials or
something? Or like - anonymous.
13.

GEORGE
No way. You deserve credit. And you
should stand up to your father.

Emily’s silent, thinking this over. Then she smiles.

EMILY
You know what? Fuck it. You’re
right. Publish it, with my name and
everything. Thank you, George.

GEORGE
(pocketing the poem)
Any time, Miss Dickinson.

George leans forward, and KISSES Emily on the lips. Then, he
hops over the porch railing, and takes off, down the lawn.

Lavinia, through the window, makes a kissy-kissy face at
Emily. Emily sticks a finger in her mouth like, gag me.

INT. PARLOR - DAY

Emily marches back into the parlor, where her mother and
sister are cleaning up.

EMILY
That was a disaster.

MOTHER
Yes, Emily, you ruined it again.

LAVINIA
She didn’t ruin it! They were
kissing! I saw!

MOTHER
(scandalized)
Kissing?! My god! What is wrong
with you?!

EMILY
You're the one who keeps throwing
me at these men!

MOTHER
I’m not throwing you--

EMILY
Yes you are! It’s humiliating!
You'd pawn me off on a widower, a
cripple - anyone who would take me!
(MORE )
14.

EMILY (CONT'D)
The whole town of Amherst knows how
bad you want to get rid of me!

At this moment, Emily’s father, EDWARD DICKINSON, appears in
the doorway.

As soon as he enters the room, the energy changes. He’s in
charge of this family - a bona fide New England patriarch, in
a top hat and tails.

Mr. Dickinson can be tough, even harsh, which is why it would
be great if he was played by someone adorable (say, Bob
Balaban). He loves his daughter Emily enormously, but their
relationship contains much darkness and complexity.

Now, he regards his wife and daughters the way a farmer might
look at some chickens.

EDWARD
What’s all the fuss?

EMILY
Mother’s trying to disown me again.

MOTHER
You're twenty-five years old,
Emily! I was married at eighteen -
it’s high time for you to find a
husband!

EMILY
And move out, you mean!?

MOTHER
Well yes, that is what happens when
girls get married!

LAVINIA
Why doesn’t anyone care if I get a
husband?!

Edward puts his hands up, shushing them all.

EDWARD
Emily doesn’t have to marry anyone,
as far as I’m concerned.

EMILY
Thank you, Dad. Jesus - at least
somebody around here isn’t trying
to kick me out of the family.
15.

MOTHER
(to Edward, annoyed)
So you’d just let her stay here, in
our house, till kingdom come, doing
nothing all day--

EMILY
I do plenty!

MOTHER
Oh, like what?

EMILY
I’m the one who found all those
bird’s nests.

She points.

INSERT:

In the corner, on a table, is a HUGE PILE OF BIRD’S NESTS.
BACK TO:

EDWARD
(ending the discussion)
All right. It’s time for you ladies
to clear out, so I can enjoy my
pipe and newspaper in peace.

He settles into his armchair. Mrs. Dickinson picks up a tray.

MOTHER
Very well. We should get back to
the kitchen, anyway. Girls, come
with me.

EMILY
God, do I have to?!

MOTHER
(staring at her)
You have a shitty attitude, young
lady.

EMILY
I just don’t want to do chores
twenty-four hours a day.

MOTHER
And what would you do instead?

Everybody looks at Emily.
16.

EMILY
I would just - think.

Mrs. Dickinson sighs. Edward lights his pipe, and chuckles.

EDWARD
Let her have a break, Mother. It’s
all right.

EMILY
Thanks, Daddy! You’re my hero.

She kisses her father on the cheek, and runs out of the room.
Mrs. Dickinson looks at her husband, coldly.

MOTHER
You just love taking her side,
don’t you.

Edward shrugs.

MOTHER (CONT'D)
You're going to regret it. She’s
wild. She doesn’t know how to
behave like a proper young lady.
And she’ll be the ruin of this
family.

With that, Mrs. Dickinson exits. Edward puffs on his pipe.

EXT. GRASSY AREA — DAY

Emily lies face-down on a patch of grass, in the sun, staring
at a BUMBLEBEE. The bee is fat, and buzzy, ass-deep in a
dandelion.

A SHADOW falls over Emily, and the bee. She looks up. It’s
her older brother, AUSTIN.

AUSTIN
What up, sis.

EMILY
(shading her eyes)
Nothin’, bro. Just chillin’.

Austin, 28, is tall and handsome (think Benjamin Walker, or
Anders from Workaholics). Secretly, he’s a bit insecure about
his intellect -- especially in comparison to his supremely
gifted sister.
17.

AUSTIN
Heard you turned down another
suitor.

EMILY

Yeah. Not into it.
AUSTIN
Well - on the subject of marriage.
I have news.
Emily squints up at him.

EMILY
What news?

AUSTIN
I proposed to Sue. And she said
yes.

FLASH TO:

EXT. BACK OF A HAY WAGON - DAY

In the back of a hay wagon, Austin is GOING DOWN on his
girlfriend, SUE. The wagon jostles violently. Austin’s head
is up under Sue’s dress. Sue leans back, eyes closed, in
pleasure.

SUE
Yes. Yes...

Austin emerges from under Sue’s skirt, grinning.

BACK TO:

EXT. GRASSY AREA — CONTINUOUS

Emily looks like she’s just been slapped.

EMILY

No. You can’t marry Sue.
AUSTIN

Why not?
EMILY

Austin, she’s my best friend.
18.

AUSTIN
Look, Emily, don’t get crazy right
now - it’s not a good time. Sue’s
sister Mary is dead.

EMILY
What?! But she was the healthy one.

AUSTIN
I know. But then she got typhus and
died, like all the others. We have
to go to the funeral in an hour.

EMILY
Jesus. Poor Sue.

AUSTIN
Yeah. So just - be respectful of
her situation, okay?

EMILY
You don’t have to tell me to be
respectful of my best friend.

AUSTIN
Be respectful of the woman who is
going to be my wife.

Austin turns and walks off.

Emily stands there, flooded with rage, as a SONG blasts on --
Taylor Swift, “Bad Blood.”

TAYLOR
“Cause baby now we got bad blood /
Hey / Now we got problems...”

As the song plays, we see Emily SHRINK DOWN TO THE SIZE OF
THE BUMBLEBEE.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
“And I don’t think we can solve
them / You made a really deep cut /
And baby now we got bad blood!”

EXT. DANDELION - FANTASY

Emily and the BUMBLEBEE sit together on the BRIGHT YELLOW
DANDELION, drinking from giant tumblers full of liquor.

Emily is WASTED. The BEE is yellow, black, and fuzzy, with
big eyes.
19.

EMILY
It’s so obvious what’s going on
here. Austin knows I love Sue and
he’s trying to steal her from me.
He’s such an asshole.

BEE
(lighting up a joint)
Girl, don’t let this relationship
shit get in the way of your career.

EMILY
That's so smart. You’re so right.

BEE
Just make dat honey, bitch. Make
dat honey.

He hands her the joint, and she takes a HUGE HIT.

CUT TO:

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

At the funeral of Sue’s sister Mary. A sizable crowd,
including all the Dickinsons, stands around the grave as the
COFFIN gets lowered into the ground.

MINISTER
(intoning)
“O Death, where is thy victory? 0
Death, where is thy sting?”

Emily is dressed in white, as always. She looks across the
grave and sees SUE, dressed in black.

Sue is very, very beautiful -- and very, very sad.

She wipes a tear away, and gives Emily a small smile. Emily
mouths at Sue: “I love you.” Sue looks down at the grave.

The minister wraps up his final prayer and men begin
SHOVELING DIRT over the coffin.

Emily fights her way through the crowd, trying to get to Sue,
but just before she reaches her friend’s side, AUSTIN beats
her to the punch. He takes Sue by the arm, protectively, and
leads her off down the hill.

Emily stands there, irritated. Funeral guests pass by her on
all sides, on their way down the hill.

Now, Emily looks behind her and sees A STRANGE MAN.
20.

The man is tall, with SILVER HAIR, and a GRAY SUIT. He’s very
attractive, if intense (think Viggo Mortensen). The MAN
catches Emily’s eye. He WINKS at her.

Just then, LAVINIA appears at her sister’s side. She sees
Emily staring into the distance.

LAVINIA
Emily - what are you looking at?

Emily, rapt, points.

EMILY
At my friend over there.

Lavinia looks where she’s pointing. We see what Lavinia sees,
which is NOTHING.

LAVINIA
What do you mean? That tree?

We look again, and once again see what Emily sees - the MAN,
who is now walking over towards them.

EMILY
Never mind, Lavinia.

The man comes right over to them. He leans in and whispers
into Emily's ear.

MAN
See you tonight.

Emily nods, blushing. The man walks away.

Lavinia is confused, but then, she’s used to her sister being
weird.

LAVINIA
Come on, Emily. Let’s go home.

Emily and Lavinia walk together, down the hill.
LAVINIA (CONT'D)
That was a lovely funeral, don’t
you think?
Emily shrugs.

EMILY
Mine will be better.
21.

As Emily and Lavinia walk, they pass by a GROUP OF GIRLS,
well-dressed and well-coiffed. Emily overhears them,
gossiping about her.

GIRL
Oh my god, it’s Emily Dickinson.

The girls all titter.
GIRL (CONT'D)
She's so intense. I seriously
cannot handle her.

Emily pretends not to have heard them. She lifts her chin
proudly and marches down the hill with her sister.

INT. PARLOR - DAY

Austin and Sue sit on the very stiff couch. Mr. and Mrs.
Dickinson sit across from them, on two very stiff armchairs.

They are all in their funeral clothes. Sue’s face is bleak.

EDWARD
Well. We are very happy for you.

Awkward silence.

EDWARD (CONT'D)

I mean - we’re very sorry about
your sister, Sue. But we’re very
happy you two shall be wed.

Austin smiles. Sue, if it is possible, looks even bleaker.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
So, Austin. What are your plans?

MOTHER
Yes, dear, tell us.

Austin takes Sue’s hand.

AUSTIN
Well - obviously, nothing is
decided yet, but... there is a
firm, in Michigan. They have
offered me a position. And Sue has
a cousin there, so...

He trails off. His father stares at him, blankly.
22.

EDWARD
So what.

AUSTIN
So - we're thinking of moving to
Detroit.

Silence.

AUSTIN (CONT'D)
I’m pretty psyched about it,
actually.

Edward coughs.

EDWARD
I don’t think so.

Austin looks at his father, confused.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
You'll join my firm, and stay right
here in Amherst.

AUSTIN
But - Father, like I just said, I
want to go out West...

EDWARD
Nonsense. We can’t have you living
so far. This is Amherst. You are a
Dickinson. Your grandfather lived
here, and his father before that.
Right here in this house.

Austin stands up in frustration, and paces to the window.

Behind him, OUT THE WINDOW, we notice A WICKER BASKET, that
is being lowered down BY A STRING.

Austin doesn’t see the basket. He’s flipping out at his dad.
AUSTIN

Okay - so what do you expect - that
Sue and I will get married and live

upstairs?!
EDWARD
Of course not. Don’t be absurd.
(beat)

You’1l live next door.
23.

AUSTIN
Next door?! What - in the Irish
shanties?! With the stable boys?
EDWARD
Austin, collect yourself. The lot
adjacent has come up for sale. I
mean to purchase it. We shall build
you a house.
Austin gapes at his father.

Meanwhile, Sue, from the couch, has noticed the BASKET. She
points at it, wordlessly.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
The most modern, most elegant of
houses. You may oversee the design
yourselves. It can be built by
fall. Consider it a wedding gift.

Austin doesn’t know what to say. He looks at Sue, who is
pointing at the window.

AUSTIN
What is it, Sue?

He turns around, and sees the BASKET. Irritated, he tugs the
window open, and pulls the basket inside.

INSERT:

The basket. Which holds AN ENVELOPE.

Austin pulls the envelope out. It says: “For Sue.”
Austin ignores this. He rips the envelope open.

Inside is ANOTHER ENVELOPE. It says: “Austin. Do not read
this. Give it to Sue.”

BACK TO:
Austin, aggravated, hands the envelope over to Sue.
Sue takes it, opens it, and pulls out a notecard.
INSERT:

The notecard. Which says, in Emily’s handwriting: “Meet me in
the woods.”

BACK TO:
24.

Sue looks at Austin. He shakes his head. Sue gets up and
leaves the room.

Austin looks like he wants to punch somebody in the face.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Deep in the woods behind the Dickinson house, Emily stands
with her arms folded, looking pissed off.

Sue comes walking towards her. The two girls face off.

EMILY
Is this some kind of fucking joke?

Sue says nothing.

EMILY (CONT'D)
You're marrying my brother? Are you
insane?

SUE
What else was I supposed to do,
Emily? My entire family is dead.

EMILY
I know, and I feel terrible about
that, but - Austin?! You don’t even
like him! You told me that you
don’t respect his intellect.

Sue shrugs.

EMILY (CONT'D)

And besides, I thought we were
never getting married. I thought we
were going to grow up and become
great writers together.

SUE
That's a stupid promise we made
when we were fourteen years old.
And even then, I knew it was a lie.
I’m not like you, Emily. I didn’t
grow up with money. I don’t get to
prance around a gorgeous mansion
all day and get away with never
doing my chores. I don’t have your
perfect fucking life.

EMILY
You think my life is perfect?! Do
you even know me?!
25.

SUE
I’m all alone in this world. I’m
destitute. If I don’t marry Austin,
I will literally starve to death.

EMILY
So you're marrying him for his
money. Cool. Very cool.

SUE
Spoken like a true fucking rich
girl.

They glare at each other. Then Emily softens.

EMILY
I’m sorry about Mary. I really
liked her.

SUE
Yeah. I liked her too. She was my
favorite sister.

EMILY
Well - since you’re marrying Austin
- I guess I’1l be your sister now.

They look at each other.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Promise me something, Sue.

SUE
What.

EMILY
Okay, promise me two things.

Sue waits.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Number one, that you won’t move
away to Michigan. (Beat.) And
number two —

SUE
Yeah?

EMILY
That you will always love me more
than him.

For the first time, we see something like a SMILE glimmer
over Sue’s face.
26.

SUE
Well. As far as the first one goes -
that’s really Austin’s decision.
But as far as the second -—

EMILY
Yeah?

SUE
Well, that one’s obvious. I love
you so much, Emily. I love you so
much, I think I might go to hell
for it.

A thunderclap. It starts to RAIN. And in the downpour, Emily
takes Sue into her arms, and KISSES HER. Madly, deeply.

The two girls make out furiously in the rain, in the woods.

Now would be a good time for another great song - maybe
something by Lorde? I think you get it.

EXT. LAWN - AFTERNOON

On the lawn, Austin is playing a game of CROQUET with George,
Emily's suitor.

George leans on his MALLET, sipping a glass of SHERRY.

GEORGE
You could have had any girl in
town, and you picked Sue Gilbert?
Why?

Austin lines up a shot, and expertly hits a RED BALL through
a wicket.

AUSTIN
I think it’s because she’s the only
one who didn’t want me.

George laughs, and takes a shot. He misses.

GEORGE
Well - I can relate to that. Your
sister is still playing hard to
get.

AUSTIN
I'm afraid my sister really is hard
to get, old chap. In the sense of,
hard to comprehend. She’s a freak.
27.

GEORGE
She's a genius.

AUSTIN
I'm so sick of people saying that.

Austin takes a big whack at a ball. It goes careening off
down the slope, and hits a tree.

At the same time, EMILY and SUE emerge from the woods. They
are slightly TOUSLED.

GEORGE
Hello, ladies.

EMILY
What are you doing here, George?

Austin takes Sue possessively by the arm.

AUSTIN
Sue - I need to talk to you about
something.

Sue glances at Emily, and then allows herself to be steered
away by Austin.

Emily and George are left alone.

George, trying to be cool, takes out a pair of 19th-century
wire-framed SUNGLASSES and awkwardly slips them on.

GEORGE
Well, babe. It’s done.

Emily looks at him, unimpressed.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
Your poem. It’s in the Indicator.
Right next to a thing I wrote about
Percy Shelley. The printers have it
- it’1l be out next week.

(beat)
You're a little bit famous now,
Emily Dickinson.

He grins at her, expecting to see her smile back.
Instead, she looks pale, anxious. She bites her fingernail.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
Emily? What’s wrong?

She shakes her head.
28.

EMILY
I’m just - scared.

GEORGE
You?! I’ve never seen you scared of
anything - you’re absolutely
fearless!

EMILY
I just don’t know how my father
will react.
George scoffs at this.
GEORGE
Seriously - come on. Your dad is a
good guy. I know he’s a little
conservative - but he loves you.
And he’s smart. He has to know how
brilliant you are. And that’s not
something he’d want to stand in the
way of - is it?
Emily looks at George, wanting to believe what he’s saying.
Then, from the house, she hears Lavinia, SCREAMING.

LAVINIA (0.S.)
Emily! EMILY!!!

CUT TO:

EXT. DOOR TO THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Lavinia stands outside the door to the kitchen, wearing an
APRON, screaming for her sister.

LAVINIA
EMILY! COME! MAKE! DINNER! !!!

BACK TO:

EXT. LAWN - CONTINUOUS
Emily nods to George.

EMILY
I gotta go.

She hurries off towards the house - but calls back, over her
shoulder.
29.
EMILY (CONT'D)
Thanks again, George!

George leans on his mallet, and watches her go. He sighs.

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
Pre-dinner CHORES MONTAGE. Fire. Water. Chickens.

Emily CUTTING AN ONION, and CRYING.

INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

In the dining room, the whole family sits around the table:
Mother, Father, Emily, Austin, Lavinia, and Sue.

The table is laid with beautiful white china, and there’s
lots of delicious-looking food.

A KITTEN plays at Lavinia’s feet.
Edward tears into a piece of chicken.

EDWARD
Wonderful chicken, Mrs. Dickinson.

Mrs. Dickinson beams.

AUSTIN
It really is delicious, Mother.
MOTHER
Well - thank your sisters. They
helped.
LAVINIA

One of us did.
Emily pinches Lavinia, under the table.
Edward clinks on his glass, with a silver knife.
EDWARD
Now, now, listen here. I have a

rather exciting announcement.

Everyone looks at him, curious.
30.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
As you know, in addition to running
my successful law practice, as well
as maintaining my position as
Treasurer of Amherst College, I’ve
also served two terms in the
Massachusetts House of
Representatives. Well - I’ve got my
eye on something bigger now.
(beat)
I have decided to run for Congress.
(beat)
Of the United States of America.

General shock and awe. Mrs. Dickinson looks a bit queasy.

AUSTIN
Father - that’s marvelous!

EMILY
Holy crap, Dad!

Lavinia’s KITTEN, under the table, YOWLS.

EDWARD
I appreciate the enthusiasm. Your
mother was quite opposed to the
idea.

MOTHER
I just don’t want you away from
home so much. Candidates are always
moving about.

EDWARD
Well, we’ve got to get out the
vote, now, haven’t we? The vote,
and the message.

SUE
What is your message, Mr.
Dickinson?

EDWARD
Mine? Well - it’s simple. Let’s
keep the country together, that’s
what I say. Let’s not be torn
apart.

AUSTIN
You mean - by slavery.

LAVINIA
Father, are you an abolitionist?
31.

EDWARD
Of course not. I don’t care one way
or the other about slavery. I just
don’t think we ought to go to war
about it.

MOTHER
Very sensible, dear.

AUSTIN
Personally, I think this Fugitive
Slave Act is ridiculous. It’s
making us regular citizens into
slave-hunting patrols.

EDWARD
You're right about that.

EMILY
Sometimes I feel like a slave.

Everyone looks at her, horrified.

MOTHER
You are a spoiled girl from
Amherst, Emily Dickinson. Far from
a slave.

Emily takes a bite of chicken.

EDWARD
Well, it’s a messy business. But we
must preserve the Union, at all
costs. That’s my platform. Oh - and
bring the railroad to Amherst. That
too.

LAVINIA
The railroad! Fancy!

EDWARD
Yes, Lavinia, if I’m elected, you
shall hear the sound of a train
whistle out your bedroom window!

EMILY
That sounds like a nightmare.

Sue giggles.
EDWARD

I see I may have a problem
convincing some of my constituency.
32.

Austin, now, clinks on his glass.

AUSTIN
Well, congratulations, Father. And
we have an announcement to make as
well.

Everyone looks at him.

AUSTIN (CONT'D)

Sue and I have discussed it - and
we will not be moving to Detroit.
We're staying here in Amherst -
with the family.

EMILY
Hurray!

MOTHER
Oh, that’s wonderful, darling.

EDWARD
Excellent, excellent! You can hold
the firm together, while I’m off
running my campaign.

Austin nods, uneasy.

MOTHER
Oh, we'll have a big, lovely
wedding! We’ll invite all the
Dickinson and Norcross cousins -
and Sue, of course, your whole
family will come--

SUE
My whole family is dead.

Awkward silence.
MOTHER
Well.
(beat)
It will still be very nice.
Now, suddenly, Emily CLINKS ON HER GLASS.

EDWARD
What is it, Emily?

EMILY
I also have an announcement.

Heads turn to her.
33.

EMILY (CONT'D)
It’s not that big of a deal. I
mean, compared to Congress, and
getting married, and whatever.

MOTHER
Well, what is it, then?

She takes a deep breath.
EMILY
A poem I wrote - is going to be
published. Next week. In the
college magazine.

Absolute silence. Deafening, hair-raising silence. Silence
that could crush you.

Then, Edward speaks - very low, and icy.
EDWARD
I don’t think I heard you
correctly. Say that again.

The color goes out of Emily’s face.

EMILY
My poem - will be published.

EDWARD
How. Dare. You.

Emily's face gets even more pale, as she realizes how ugly
this is going to be.
EDWARD (CONT'D)

Have I, or have I not, made it

quite clear that I do not approve

of a woman seeking to build herself

a literary reputation?
Emily, barely, nods.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
And yet you have gone and done it.

Silence.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
Well. Is there any way to stop it?

Emily, scared, shakes her head.
34.

EMILY
(quiet)
It’s already gone to print.

Edward SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN on the table.

EDWARD
You - wicked - girl! You will bring
shame upon this family!

Emily looks at her MOTHER, and finds only more disapproval.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
(shouting)
Your mother was right! We have
given you too much freedom - and
you have taken advantage of our
kindness! Oh, this is a bad time,
Emily - a very bad time indeed,
that you have chosen to exhibit
such scandalous behavior! My god,
you will ruin the good name of
DICKINSON!!!

Again, Edward slams BOTH FISTS down. The plates CLATTER.

Everyone besides him and Emily, all at once, GETS UP AND
LEAVES THE ROOM.

Emily is alone at the big table with her father, and his
rage.

EDWARD (CONT'D)

Do you not understand, Emily, that
we have a reputation to protect in
this town?

He waits for a response. She says nothing.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
Speak to me when I address you.
SPEAK!!!

EMILY
(hoarse)
Yes, Father.

EDWARD
The Dickinsons have lived in
Amherst for two hundred years. We
made this town what it is. Everyone
knows that.

(MORE )
EDWARD (CONT'D)
But your grandfather was a drunk,
and a debtor, and he practically
squandered everything my ancestors
worked so hard to build. I’ve spent
my life cleaning up his mess. I’ve
scrimped, and sacrificed - and by
God's grace, I’ve restored our
family to its good standing. And
now, I refuse to have my efforts
undone BY MY OWN DAUGHTER!!!

Another fist-slam on the table.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
This - foolishness of yours - we
will have no more of it. You will
be correct and proper in all your
ways. You will tend to your duties,
as your mother does. You have much
room for improvement, there. Look -
I see my plate is chipped. You set
the table, didn’t you? Do you give
the master of the house a chipped
plate?

Emily is silent.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
Now. As punishment - you will clean
up in here. And in the kitchen.
Alone.

Edward stands up and leaves.

35.

Emily waits a moment, by herself. The room is silent.

Then, she stands up. Walks around to her father’s
Picks up his PLATE. It is, indeed, CHIPPED.

Emily stares at the plate for a second. Then, she
around and HURLS IT at the STONE FIREPLACE.

The plate SHATTERS.

EXT. FRONT WALKWAY - NIGHT

From a distance, we see Emily waiting outside the

the moonlight. She wears an overcoat, and a scarf.

A BLACK CARRIAGE pulled by WHITE HORSES rolls up.

A HAND reaches out of the carriage. Takes Emily’s
steps in.

36.

The carriage ROLLS AWAY.

INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT

Inside the carriage, Emily sits across from her companion:
the STRANGE MAN she saw earlier, at the funeral.

This is Emily’s lover. This is DEATH.

DEATH
Nice to see you.

EMILY
You were late.

DEATH
Most people would be glad if I
never came.

EMILY
Not me. I always want to see you.

Death smiles at her.

DEATH
So, your poem is going to be
published.

EMILY
No. Father won’t allow it.

DEATH
I thought you said it was too late
to stop it.

EMILY

Father will burn every copy, if he
has to. Anything to prevent me from
ruining the good name of Dickinson.

Death laughs.

DEATH
My dear, you’ll be the only
Dickinson they talk about in two
hundred years. I promise you that.

EMILY
Even if my poems are never
published?
37.

DEATH
Publicity is not the same as
immortality.

EMILY
Immortality is nothing. All it
takes is being very good and well-
behaved. And then you go to heaven.

DEATH
That’s not the kind I mean. Your
immortality will not come from
following the rules. It will come
from breaking them.

Emily smiles at him.

EMILY
Today at Mary’s funeral, they said
she was going to heaven. Is it
true?

Death shrugs.

DEATH
I suppose. She was kind of blah.

Emily laughs. Her body relaxes into the seat. She looks at
Death, flirtatiously.

EMILY
When will you come for me?

DEATH
I come for you every night, my
darling.

EMILY
No - not just for a ride. To take
me away from this place.

DEATH
Ah. Not for many, many years.

EMILY
But you took Mary. Do you love her
more than me?

Death just laughs. He pats the seat next to him. Emily gets
up and squeezes in beside him.

The carriage RIDES THROUGH THE DARKENED STREETS OF AMHERST,
under the moon.
38.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Emily is finishing up the arduous task of cleaning the entire
kitchen by herself, after dinner.

She is sweaty, dirty, and tired.

She wipes a hand on her forehead. Some ASHES from the
fireplace SMUDGE her brow.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Emily trudges upstairs and runs into Austin, in the upstairs
hallway. He’s in his pajamas.

AUSTIN
Another fight with Dad, huh?

Emily shakes her head, exhausted.

AUSTIN (CONT'D)
Don't be too hard on him, Em. I
know he can be tough - but he only
wants to protect us.

Emily says nothing.

AUSTIN (CONT'D)
Can I tell you a secret?

She looks at him.

AUSTIN (CONT'D)
I’m happy we’re not moving to
Detroit. I feel better here, with
the family.

Emily gives him a small smile.

AUSTIN (CONT'D)
Hey - do me a favor.

EMILY
Yeah?

AUSTIN
Do what you can - to cheer up Sue.
She's so depressed. I’m worried
about her.

EMILY
Sure. Of course.
39.

AUSTIN
Thanks, sis.

The siblings are now interrupted by the appearance of their
MOTHER, in her nightgown.

MOTHER
Emily - get to sleep. We need you
up bright and early tomorrow.
Another suitor is coming.

EMILY
Oh, great. Who is it this time?

MOTHER
A pig farmer, from South Hadley.

EMILY
Sexy.

Austin laughs. Mother shoos them both off to their rooms.

MOTHER
Go to bed!

INT. EMILY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the moonlit shadows of her bedroom, Emily sits at her tiny
writing desk, by the window.

She lights a candle, takes out her pencil, closes her eyes,
and thinks.

EMILY (V.O.)
“Because I could not stop for
Death...”
There is a KNOCK on her door.

Startled, she leaps up, BLOWS OUT the candle, and JUMPS IN
BED, under the covers.

Another KNOCK.
EMILY
(from bed)
Who is it?

The door opens. Standing in the doorway is her FATHER. He’s
wearing a nightgown himself, and a knitted nightcap.

EDWARD
Emily. Are you awake.
40.

EMILY
(sitting up)
Yes, Father.

EDWARD
May I come in?

EMILY
Yes, you may.

Edward comes in, shuts the door behind him. He sits down on
the bed, next to Emily.

He waits a beat or two, then speaks.

EDWARD
I was rather gruff with you
tonight.

Another beat.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
I'd hate to think that you were
angry with me.

She says nothing.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
You just - you can’t know how I
worry about you children.

He looks at her. Then, unexpectedly, he BREAKS INTO A SOB.

EDWARD (CONT'D)
(crying)
Oh, Emily!

EMILY
(disturbed)
Father, what is it! Oh, Father,
don’t cry!

EDWARD
I just don’t want to lose you,
Emmy. Promise me! Promise me, okay?

EMILY
Promise you what?

EDWARD
Promise you won't get married and
move away.
41.

Edward clutches Emily’s hand, and stares at her through his
tears. It’s touching, though deeply strange.

EMILY
I won’t leave you, Dad.

He smiles.

EDWARD
Oh, that makes me happy. Keep the
family together, that’s what I say.
Don’t let it get torn apart.

Now Edward lies down in Emily’s narrow bed, beside her. His
head rests on her pillow. She lies down next to him.

EMILY
Hey Dad. Can you promise me
something, too?

EDWARD
What is it, my dear?

Emily stares up at the ceiling.

EMILY
Promise me - that we can hire a
maid.

Edward, against all his better judgement, laughs.

EDWARD
Oh, Emily. All right.

She grins. He closes his eyes, and within seconds, FALLS FAST
ASLEEP. He starts to SNORE.

As soon as Emily realizes that he’s sleeping, she carefully
CLIMBS OUT OF BED, and returns to her WRITING DESK.

She sits down AT HER DESK, in the moonlight. She starts to
write.

EMILY (V.0.)
“Because I could not stop for Death
/ He kindly stopped for me. / The
carriage held but just ourselves /
And immortality.”

She finishes writing. Punctuates her sentence. Leans back.
EMILY

(to herself)
Nailed it.
42.

A FINAL BURST OF MUSIC. This time, it’s KANYE. The remix of
the Daft Punk song, “Stronger.”

KANYE
“N-n-now that don’t kill me / Can
only make me stronger...”

We leave Emily, at her desk, and GO OUT THE WINDOW, into the
night.

KANYE (CONT'D)
“I need you to hurry up now / Cause
I can’t wait much longer...”
The big Dickinson house glows, eerie, in the moonlight.

In the sky, there are thousands of stars.

FADE OUT.
