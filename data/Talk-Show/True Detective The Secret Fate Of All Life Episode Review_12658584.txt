TRUE DETECTIVE
Chapter Five: ‘The Secret Fate of All Life’

TITLE CREDITS.
FADE IN:
EXT. SULPHUR, LOUSIANA - DAY 1

A REFINERY TOWN built around LAKE CALCASIEU; steel piping,
flaming exhaust, ugly beneath the tree-fringed sky--

EXT. ROADHOUSE- SULPHUR, LA - DAY 2

A country ROADHOUSE. Gravel lot, no name on bar. Above the
forest, the oil refineries pump smoke across sky--

Old CHEVY truck with camper and mudders rolls into lot, parks.
Sits a beat as the driver, DEWALL, studies the tavern. He
climbs out, big, bearded-- Enters the bar--

INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY 3

Soft in b.g., Waylon Jennings sings ‘BAKER STREET’ from an old
jukebox while a beefy BARTENDER cleans nozzles. Only other
inhabitants, RUST COHLE and GINGER at a gouged booth--

Dewall enters, nods to bartender, spots Cohle and Ginger--
Bartender alert as Dewall lumbers to them--

He sits, stares, Cohle still in biker gear-- Ginger’s face beat
to shit, broken nose, two black eyes-- Dewall studies Ginger--

DEWALL
Happened your face?

GINGER
«+-Pool game the other night. Called
the wrong dude on cheatin’.

DEWALL
...Huh.
(re Cohle)
And what d’you want, again?

COHLE
.-.I’m repping some people, looking
to get the good cook. They’d trade
you or the IC Brotherhood, however
you want it. Coke for crystal.

All Dewall’s responses come after a pause of scrutiny--
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 2.

DEWALL
Why ain’t I talkin to Miles?

COHLE
Me an’ Ginger’re ole friends.
Boosted together.

DEWALL
(to Ginger)
You ain’t saying much.

GINGER
Figure I let my man give you
details.

Dewall watches them a while longer, jukebox throughout--

No answer,

COHLE
Shit I got coming in, you can step
on it five, six times, it’s still
kick. Just means you cook a little
more. For a lot more profit.

not a hint of anything but a reptile intelligence--

DEWALL
Ain’t got no use for it. Or your
money.

COHLE

Money don’t spend?

DEWALL
...I can see your soul at the edges of
your eyes. It’s corrosive, like acid.
You got a demon, little man.
(rises)
And I don’t like your face. It
makes me want to do things to it.

Dewall nods to Bartender, who nods back--

DEWALL (CONT'D)
You call me again, Ginger, I’m
settin Miles on you...

(to Cohle)
I see you again, I’m puttin you
down. There’s a shadow on you, son.

He walks out. Cohle turns to Ginger, pissed--
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 3.

COHLE
“Called the wrong dude on
cheatin’”? You think I’m stupid as
you? He’s right, you know...

With only his eyes, Cohle threatens Ginger’s life--

COHLE (CONT'D)
...You wanna see my shadow?

INT. MOVING, COHLE’S TRUCK - DAY 4

Cohle drives. Ginger not visible, but audible, whining-- Cohle
juiced from the past 24 hours, sweating. He’s on a CB RADIO--

COHLE
You got him, Marty? You fucking
better, the shit I’ve--

INT. MOVING, HART’S CAR - DAY 5

Hart drives, also on CB RADIO-- Down a rural highway, cutting
away from the refineries, into deep woods--

HART
--I do. I got him. But we’re on empty
roads now. I gotta drop back or he’1l
spot the tail...

AHEAD, Dewall’s truck is small in the distance-- No other cars.
Forest fences the road, distant refineries--

HART (CONT'D)
Where’s Ginger?

COHLE (0.S.)
Wrapped up. Tell me your location--

HART
South of I-10, along the Creole
Nature Trail. Going toward Carlyss.
Hurry up, man--

INT. MOVING, COHLE’S TRUCK - DAY 6
Cohle hangs up the CB. Speeds, zigging through traffic--

COHLE
How we doing back there, Ginger?

PAN as he talks, to extended cab behind front seat-- Where
Ginger has been duct-taped up in several garbage bags,
struggles in vain as Cohle’s driving slams him around the cab--
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 4.

I/E. HART’S CAR - BACK ROADS - CARLYSS, LA - DAY 7

Hart following at a long distance, on an exposed country road--
A slight RISE-- and Hart loses Dewall’s truck--

He can no longer spot the Chevy he’s following-- FUCK--
CUT TO:
EXT. BACK ROADS, FOREST - DAY 8

Hart stands at his CAR, parked on a dirt shoulder beside some
forest as Cohle’s truck arrives, parks-- He exits--

HART
Where's Ginger?

COHLE
Kicking back in a ditch. What’s
going on?

HART
Lost him a minute. I had to double-back
a few times till I saw a turn off--

He nods toward the forest, to a path so thin and grassy it’s
almost indistinguishable from the woods--

COHLE
Did you lose him?

HART
Found his truck. Parked.

CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST, LOUISIANA - DAY 9

Hart and Cohle walk the thin path, badges and guns visible.
THICK FOREST surrounds-—

They stop as the trail tapers off-- Where a rusted CATTLE-GATE
fences off a small CLEARING-- Beyond the cattle-gate sits
Dewall’s CHEVY. DEEP WOODS surround a wilderness maze--

HART
...We gotta call it in, Rust.

COHLE
...We don’t know where they are
yet... Just maybe about where they
are. I don’t wanna flood the woods.
How many directions could they run?

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 5.

COHLE (CONT'D)
Parish? Who says they won't get a

tip-off?
HART
We're not gonna find em from here.
COHLE
.---Cut sign, man. You ever been hunting?
HART
10-point buck, year before last. Sixty
yards.
COHLE

Real hunting. Tracking. Not waiting
to ambush a deer sniffing gash bait.

Hart looks to the thick forest, endless possibilities for
ambush-- He turns back to Rust--

HART
Jesus, you're a prick. ...We find
the place, we come back. Call it
in. One of us’ll stay on
surveillance.

COHLE
Yeah. I can live with that.

They look at each other a moment, an acknowledgment, the
increasing stakes of their reliance on one another--

Cohle steps over the gate, Hart following, until they’re
swallowed--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 10
Hart, 52--
GILBOUGH
So you get a tip where Ledoux
cooks. Cohle comes back... from

wherever he was...

PAPANIA
.--You knew it was gonna get here,
man. Just the once... The way you
tell it.

HART

I tell it the same way I told it to the
shooting board and every cop bar
between Houston and Biloxi...

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 6.
HART (CONT'D)
You know why the story’s exactly the

same, seventeen years gone? Because it
only went down the one way.

EXT. FOREST, LOUISIANA - DAY 11

Cohle and Hart, dirty, moving through FOREST, no clear path is
discernible-- Cohle leads in a crouch, scanning--

HART 2012 (V.O.)
Cohle’s dad taught him bow-hunting. Had
to track game till you got within maybe
thirty yards of it--

Cohle spots broken stalks-- He indicates the path to Hart,
continues in that direction--

TIME CUT:
EXT. FOREST, LOUISIANA - DAY 12
ON a monofilament TRIPWIRE across a pathless bramble-- Cohle
follows the LINE, which leads to a CLAYMORE at the base of a
tree, covered in leaves, ‘Front Toward Enemy'--
Rust carefully leads them over the TRIPWIRE, deeper in--

TIME CUT:
EXT. FOREST, LOUISIANA 13

Same wilderness, another TRIPWIRE Cohle spots, another one
overhead, cross-hatched to CLAYMORES-- They see--

TWO STICK LATTICEWORKS mark the path beyond, small sentinels--
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 14

Rust Cohle, 49, sips his flask. Sets it down. He arranges his
army of beer-can men, toying--

COHLE
...-It’s a really good story. I never
get tired of tellin it. Legend shit,
you know?

PAPANIA
Why you so hot to see the new
discovery file, man?

A quick, admonishing glance from Gilbough to Papania- Shut up--
Back to Cohle, who clocked that--
15

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 7.

COHLE
...-Well, why you so hot to not let
me see it? This is like a
consultation, huh?

GILBOUGH
.»-You go first. You take me
through it, I’1ll let you see what
we got.

Long beat, lights a cig-- Exhales a slow thick plume--

COHLE
I’1l hold you to that.

EXT. FOREST, LOUISIANA - DAY 15

Familiar view of Ledoux’s METH SHACK: TRACK UP a hillock to the
dim sound- Thunk, Thunk -reaching the top of the rise--

Cohle and Hart both crest the hillock. Sweaty, shirts soaked--
They take in the clearing, the shack, back to one another--
They draw guns and they begin their descent--

FOLLOW, halting, crouching in tall grass for cover-- Peering
around to study the shack, the shed. Stick latticeworks are
arranged around the cabin-- Detectives speak in whispers--

COHLE
Tripwires back there. Clearing could
be mined...
HART
Alright. How you wanna do it?
COHLE
«+-Go back. Call it in. I’11 wait

here.
Hart given pause by Cohle’s obvious calculations--

HART
«+-You gonna hold position?

COHLE
You bet.

Hart understands that he has no intention of waiting--

Then, down in the clearing, they both see-- DEWALL exits the
cabin, lumbers toward the SHED near the treeline--

COHLE (CONT'D)
»--Go on now, Marty.
16

19

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 8.

Hart knows he can leave Cohle or he can back him up--
HART
..-Fuck you. Gonna do that without
me...

This means something to Cohle-- He motions that he’ll go first--

COHLE
..-Match my footprints.

Cohle starts down the last dozen yards before the treeline
breaks-- Hart follows--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 16

Rust Cohle, 49--

COHLE
We were just about to turn back and
call in Parish, State, whoever... I

mean, we're ready to just leave the
shit be. Wasn't what happened. Soon
as we'd decided to back off--

He claps his hands together- whack!
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 17
Hart, 52--
HART

--Blam! Bullets cut through, right by

Rust’s head. We both roll opposite

ways, into high growth. But we’re

spotted. They got something high

velocity. Blew apart a tree between us.

I mean, it is on--

EXT. FOREST, CLEARING - DAY 18

No such conflict. Rust leads them out of the treeline, into the
clearing-- He stays in shadow, studying the ground--

COHLE’S POV-- small indentations in the wide lawn, where some
dandelions grow (indicates disturbed earth): mines--

Cohle crosses the open ground quickly, zig-zags dandelion
patches-- Ends by crouching beside the CABIN, beneath a window--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 19

Cohle, 49, over-dramatic--
20

21

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 9.

COHLE
Under fire-- Ferns and whatnot
bursting around us. Later found out
they had an AK. With the drum
cartridge. Cut a swathe right
through the forest--
choomchoomchoom. Heavy fire--

EXT. METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 20

Cohle’s safe against the cabin, beneath the window. Moves to
the other side, out of sight of the SHED--

HART 2012 (V.O.)
Blamblamblam. Felt them AK rounds zip
by, even with the ringing in my ears--
Whif.Whif.Whif.

Hart's followed Cohle down. Now goes a little farther, crouches
at the back of the main cabin-- LATTICEWORKS posted around,
various sizes, recalling the initial crime scene--

ON COHLE, peeping up through a crack in a foil-covered window--
nothing. Sticking his head around the trailer, to the SHED-- no
movement. Sudden creaks from the TRAILER, it shakes with
footsteps, rocking as something heavy moves inside--

Hart indicates the other side of the trailer, a head-nod--
Cohle moves to that side of the trailer--

Hart double-checks the SHED. No movement--

Cohle crouches below another window, near the door-- He peers
through and sights in on the interior, aiming his pistol-- He
signals for Hart to enter through front door--

INT. TRAILER / METH SHACK - FOREST - DAY 21

REGGIE LEDOUX stands at a sink, rinsing out what look likes an
old dog dish. Tattooed, he wears only a towel wrapped around
his waist-- The small kitchen filthy, full of dirty dishes,
chemistry equipment, hot-plates-- A spiral brand on his back--

Outside the window, unseen, Cohle has Ledoux in his sights--
The running water masks the slight squeal of the screen door as--

HART stands in the front door, gun level on the big man’s head--

HART
State Police. Put your hands on top
your head. Lace your fingers and
get on your knees. Do it.
22

24

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 10.

Reggie considers making a move, maybe grabbing the RIFLE near the
sink-- Cohle whistles to him through the window-- Reggie sees this
second man with a gun on him--

Slowly he raises his hands, locks his fingers atop his head--
Flat, belligerent stare, as if he’s in control-- Hart backs out--

HART (CONT'D)
Come on out here now. Get down on
your knees.

EXT. METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 22

Reggie descends trailer steps, Hart with gun on him. Cohle
comes around from the side, covering him while watching the
SHED for signs of movement--

Reggie kneels down, stares between the detectives-- Hart cuffs
his hands behind his back-- Then Reggie looks at the LATTICEWORK
STICKS positioned around the yard-- their shadows--

LEDOUX
..-It’s time, isn’t it? The black
stars.

A muffled THUMP sounds from the back of the TRAILER-- Cohle and
Hart exchange glances--

Hart gestures that he’ll look in. Cohle moves between Ledoux
and the SHED, watching both as-- Hart enters the trailer--

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, POLICE HQ - DAY 23

Hart, 35, testifies across a long table to members of the
police SHOOTING BOARD, telling the same story as in 2012--

HART
They’d spotted us before we crossed
the forest, see? So all we could do
was duck for cover, dig in and try
gettin close... It was chaos.

EXAMINER 1
.+-How did you proceed?

HART
Rust rolled off in the high grass.
He made a run to the back of the
trailer. I was pinned behind a
tree.

EXT. METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 24

Cohle holds his gun on Ledoux, studies him--
25

28

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 11.

COHLE
...Why the antlers?

LEDOUX
.-.I saw you in my dream. You’re a
priest, too... I know what happens

next.

He nods to the stick latticeworks surrounding, their shadows
seem to elongate across the ground as clouds pass--

LEDOUX (CONT'D)
You're in Carcosa now. With me. He
sees you...

Cohle tweaks to ‘Carcosa’, from Charlie’s speech--
INT. TRAILER / METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 25

Hart moves furtively through the trailer, gun drawn-- Dark,
filthy. He passes an AK with drum barrel, turns corner--

Clears room... Turns into hallway-- He reaches a DOOR at the
end. Its outside is pad-locked-- Listens--

EXT. TRAILER / METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 26

Cohle watches Ledoux as-- The SHED DOOR opens, Dewall exits,
carrying a bin of chemistry supplies-- He catches the scene--

COHLE
Right there! Don’t move! Stay right
there and get on your knees! State
police!

INT. TRAILER / METH SHACK, FOREST - DAYS 27

Hear Cohle in b.g. as Hart smashes off the outer hinge where
the padlock connects-- Opens door onto a dark room, dark, a
smell hitting him--

EXT. TRAILER / METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 28

Cohle covers Dewall, who stands frozen near the treeline--
Ledoux still kneels, cuffed--

LEDOUX
You'll do this again. Time is a
flat circle.

COHLE
What’s that, Nietzche? Shut the
fuck up.
29

30

31

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 12.

The trailer’s door slams open and Hart stomps out, walks
directly to Ledoux and BANG-- Executes him with a head-shot--

He stands over the fallen body in blind, twitching rage, Ledoux’s
head smeared across the grass--

Cohle is shocked, looks at Marty, Ledoux’s body--

Cohle swiftly turns back to Dewall, who witnessed-- Without
knowing why Hart did that, Cohle is prepared to back him up. Cohle
raises his gun, aims for Dewall’s head: They have to do them both
now-—

Realizing his intent, Dewall drops the supplies and takes off
running, his big, loping body absurd--

Hart watches as-- Cohle tracks Dewall easily, about to take a
kill-shot, when--

An old bouncing betty springs up. KA-BOOM-- Dewall explodes--

Cohle and Hart flat on the ground as dirt and debris rain-- The
latticework sticks are all still standing. A vantage might
suggest an observational quality in them--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 29
Hart, 52--

HART
I'd come around behind, took out
Ledoux, and the other ole boy made
a run for it. Guess he wasn’t
thinking about where they’d put
them mines.

EXT. TRAILER / METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 30

Cohle and Hart rise as dust settles-- Ledoux’s body between
them, Cohle looks at Marty, wtf?-- Cohle thinks about it--

COHLE
(re Ledoux)
Get those cuffs off him before the
blood settles. We gotta make this
look right.

Cohle enters the trailer--
INT. TRAILER / METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 31

Cohle walks down the dark hallway, toward the closet with the
broken padlock-- Approaches it-- Cohle’s face twists in rage--
32

33

34

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 13.

He sees what Marty saw: Their forms partially obscured by
shadow, TWO CHILDREN’S LEGS are visible, bruised, shackled--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 32
Rust Cohle, 49--

COHLE
Captain America, Marty Hart, he flanks
around behind Ledoux. And just as he’s
turning- Bam. Clean shot. Put him
down. His buddy made a run for it. And
their cracker-ass security system did
the rest.

EXT. TRAILER / METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 33

Cohle exits, furious, carrying the AK-- Hart with Ledoux’s
body, uncuffed, in shock over what he did--

HART
«-.Oh fuck...

COHLE
Come on. We have to hurry. See to
the kids. Don’t let em out here
till I say so.

Hart looks at him, seeing his future vanish. Never killed a
man before... Cohle sees this--

COHLE (CONT'D)
What? Him? Fuck that. Good for you,
Marty.

Cohle moves near the body, stands over it as he aims the AK
toward the woods--

COHLE (CONT'D)

Nice to see you commit to

something.
Cohle opens fire on the woods from where they approached--
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, POLICE HQ - DAY 34
Now Cohle, 32, testifies before the shooting board--

COHLE
-+.-Got lucky, all it was. We coulda

just as easily been chewed to
pieces by that AK...
35

36

37

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 14.

EXT. TRAILER / METH SHACK, FOREST - DAY 35

SLOW MOTION ON Cohle firing AK with barrel drum, shooting
into the woods--

COHLE 1995 (V.O.)
...-Myself? In all honesty?

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, POLICE HQ - DAY 36
Back to Rust and the shooting board--
COHLE
I can tell you I have walked away
from the experience with an even
greater respect for the sanctity of
human life.
Glances sideways- ‘anybody buy that?’--
EXAMINER 2
Thank you, Detective. And I believe
I speak for the board when I
commend you on the heroism
displayed by you and Detective
Hart.
Cohle meekly waves off the compliment, humble--
EXT. BACK ROADS, FOREST - DAY 37
Where Cohle and Hart had left their vehicles parked, now with
STATE PD CRUISERS, lights flashing, AMBULANCES. MEDICS and
PATROLMEN standing around, a REPORTER waiting as--

ON WOODS-- Martin Hart and Rust Cohle emerge side-by-side, each
of them carrying a CHILD covered in a ratty blanket--

Hart carries a little girl, her eyes closed, face dirty--

We don’t know the gender of Cohle’s, because the blanket
covers the child’s face-- Only see the small feet--

As the medics and patrolmen rush to their aid, a news REPORTER
takes a picture--

FADE TO WHITE.

FADE IN:

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 15.

INT. STATE POLICE HQ - DAY 38

COHLE 2012 (V.O.)
There were the twig sculptures. And
LSD they had on hand matched the
batch in Dora Lange. Everybody was
pretty satisfied we’d gotten our
man...

A week later, after the shooting board. Hart and Cohle enter
homicide to applause-- Copies everywhere of THE LAFAYETTE
ADVERTISER, front page pictures of Cohle and Hart carrying
the children. Headline: ‘Hero Detectives Stop Killers, Save
Girl ’--

 

The other detectives shake hands with Cohle and Hart. A
victory for the whole team--

COHLE 2012 (V.O.)
Boy’d gone missing in January. He'd
been dead less than a day. The girl
hadn’t been reported yet. Came from
St. Landry. She was catatonic...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 39
Cohle, 49, no pleasure in recalling ‘the victory’ now--

COHLE
I checked on her, some years later.
In assisted living for girls with
special needs.

Cohle thinks on that event, hits the flask--

COHLE (CONT'D)
...Why should I live in history? I
don’t want to know anything
anymore. This is a world where
nothing is solved. Somebody once
told me, ‘Time is a flat circle.’
...-Everything we’ve ever done or
will do, we’re gonna do over and
over again... And that little girl
and that little boy are gonna be in
that room again and again,
forever...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 40

Martin Hart, 52-- Tired after being pulled into these
memories, but still in them--

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 16.

HART
There’s a few news stories about
us, you wanted to find them. I got
promoted to detective sergeant.
Rust got a commendation for
bravery. Basically because I
insisted. And, uh... Things were
real good, I guess, for a while.
Rust even chilled out, got more
regular... Maggie came around.
After a lot of talking. Counseling.
Getting in a shootout kinda opened
her up to forgiveness. Or the
possibility.

INT. SKATE RINK - DAY 41
SKATING RINK. Hart skating with Macie and Audrey-- Maggie
skates too, left back by the girls wanting to both hold their
father’s hands--

MAGGIE’S POV as Hart skates through stage-fog and laser-
lights with the girls, one holding each hand--

INT. SKATE RINK/VIDEO ARCADE - DAY 42
Macie eyes stuffed-toys through the glass wall of a GRABBING
CRANE MACHINE-- She watches Hart steer the claw, set it ona
large stuffed TOY--

Audrey already has a stuffed toy and Macie watches with
anxiety-- The claw raises and lifts the toy--

TIME CUT:
INT. SKATE RINK - DAY 43

Maggie meets them as they exit, Hart carrying the toys as the
girls skate out the arcade--

MAGGIE
Go take off your skates. It’s time
to go.
They both protest and beg for more time-- ‘Please, please’--
MACIE

Is Daddy coming home yet?

MAGGIE
-..One more time around. Then take
them off, okay?
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 17.
The girls rush to get in their last skate on the rink,
leaving Hart and Maggie alone, stuffed toys under his arms--
HART
Thank you. I needed this. I think
they did, too...

Beat, some kind of inner Rubicon approached in her--

MAGGIE
...Were there others?

HART
...What?

MAGGIE

Besides her. Were there others?

HART
No. No. And- Listen, that was a
different person, Maggie. I lost
it. Just for a little- I’m back.
I’m begging. I'll keep begging.
I‘ll go to my grave begging.

She looks him in the eye, poker-faced-- Looks away--

MAGGIE
It’s not just the... affair. You
used to be a good man. You used to
pay attention...

HART
Mag, I almost died. I cut the booze.
Five weeks now. Started doing this
program, Promise Keepers--—

MAGGIE
«+-You got a long road to climb.

HART
Yes I do.

She scrutinizes him--

Having removed skates, Audrey and Macie run to their side--
They take their toys from Marty, who crouches, kisses them--

AUDREY
Are you coming home?

HART
.--Not tonight.

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 18.

He hugs them, humble, deferential to Maggie--
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 44

Martin Hart, 52, remembering things he’s tried not to think
about--

HART
Few years. Good ones...

EXT. YARD, HART HOME - DAY 45

C.1996, Macie chases Audrey through the yard. Audrey has her
sister’s tiara, teasing her--

Before Macie can catch her, Audrey throws the tiara up in a
tree, where it hangs on a branch-- Macie chases her off
screen--

STAY ON little girl’s TIARA, hung up on a tree branch--
MONTAGE SCENE with--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 46
Hart's affected, remembering his daughters-- Almost to self--

HART

...Do you know the good years, when
you're in ‘em? Or do you just wait
for ‘em, till one day you get ass-—
cancer and realize the good years
came and went? ...Because there’s a
feeling. You might notice it
sometime. A feeling like life
slipped through your fingers. Like
the future is behind you. Like it
was always behind you...

(beat)
I cleaned up, but... Maybe I didn’t
change. Not the way I needed to...
...-You remember what I said, The
Detective’s Curse? ...The solution
to my whole life was under my nose.
That woman. Those girls. And I was

EXT. YARD, HART HOME - DAY 47

ON the little girl’s TIARA, 2002, six years later-- Never
taken down, now molded, rotting, branches grown through it--

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 19.

BELOW, MACIE (now 13) and AUDREY (now 16) walk from the bus-
stop and into their home. Not talking, Macie texting-- Both
oblivious to the tiara hanging above--

HART 2012 (V.O.)
See, infidelity is one kind of

sin... But my true failure was
inattention... I understand that
now.
INT. MEETING HALL / PROMISE KEEPERS - DAY 48

About eighty MEN in a multi-purpose hall, all white, middle-
age, like a Kiwanis meeting-- SIGNS on wall and at front
proclaim ‘PROMISE KEEPERS ‘99: TOWARD THE MILLENNIUM’ --
SPEAKER at the front of room with podium-- Seated behind the
speaker is BILLY LEE TUTTLE--

 

Martin Hart sits in back row, bored, holding a PK PAMPHLET
which reads ‘Male Virility: The Holy Spirit of Creation’--
Chuckles at pamphlet (which presents the male sex drive as an
aspect of the Holy Spirit which must be fed)-- To GUY beside
him--

 

HART
You read this?

GUY
(earnest)
Yeah. I gave one to my wife.

SPEAKER
As we stand on the cusp of our
first decade, we couldn’t be more
happy or fortunate to have as
special guest speaker one of the
spiritual guideposts of our great
state. Billy Lee Tuttle's
ministries have touched
generations, and he’s here to talk
about our roles as Men of Jesus in
the 21st Century...

APPLAUSE as Billy Lee Tuttle rises, takes podium--

TUTTLE
I’m real pleased to be here
speaking with you... Muscular,

Christian men. I see a Renaissance
here before me. Men firm of
resolve. Firm of heart. Firm of
hand. A type we don’t see enough in
this day and age.

Amens, nods-- ON Hart, rolling his eyes, checking his watch--

ON the pamphlet in his hand, a drawing of a biblical EVE,

with the caption “And she was_made to be a companion

 

hurture and serve him"--
He looks up and Tuttle meets his eyes--

TUTTLE (CONT'D)
Men with strength to prove
righteous in faithless times.
...Traditional husbands.
...Traditional wives.

Marty rises, walks out of the meeting--
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Hart, 52, lost in thought--

GILBOUGH
..-How’d Detective Cohle sort of,
chill out, like you say?

HART
Started talking to people, for one.
Down the line, one of those set-ups
Maggie was so intent on finally
hit. A doctor, no less. She and
Rust had a thing, few years.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

49

50

ON a table at a nice country RESTAURANT, soul food, family-

style. Hart, Maggie, Rust and LAURIE PERKINS (35), pretty,

refined-- Hart drinks water, no booze on the table--

LAURIE
(re Rust)
.--No, he’s a lot more right than
he sounds. Serotonin. Endorphins.
Cortisol. Dopamine. It’s more like
a biological computer than we talk
about.

HART
Great. Now there’s two of you.

It’s all genial, relaxed-- Hart and Maggie are close again--

LAURIE
No, I’m not really like him. I like
bright colors. The Three Stooges.
51

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 21.

COHLE
I’m into the Marx Brothers. And I
dig on a good sunrise.

LAURIE
But not sunsets.

MAGGIE
Really?

COHLE
No. Not really.

MAGGIE
They're the same thing.

COHLE
It’s really not.

MAGGIE
Laurie--?

LAURIE

I give him little things like that.
He’s conflict-oriented, so when I
deny him small arguments, it builds
up his energy.

HART
Boy, are you ever a match for this
dude.

Chuckles, but the observation causes a muted disquiet in Cohle, as
does Laurie grabbing his wrist affectionately-- He smiles--

Hart clocks the smile’s tension, recognizes its familiarity-- A
band starts apart from the small dance floor, country-waltz--

HART (CONT'D)
(to Maggie)
Come dance with me.

Maggie rises and he leads her out, Cohle and Laurie watch--
Cohle glances to Laurie, grins, somehow forced--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 51
Hart, 52--

HART
Look. You know about Rust. During
those seven years, he probably pulled
more assists than any detective in the
State.

54

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 22.

HART (CONT'D)
It started getting around real fast,
between city and sheriff’s-- You need
a confession, see if State Detective
Cohle’s available.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 52
Cohle, 49-- Gilbough appealing to vanity, without being obvious--

GILBOUGH
Your interview technique. Sure
there’s no secret you could pass
along? A magic question, maybe.

COHLE
Look... Everybody knows there's
something wrong with them. They
just don’t know what it is.
Everybody wants confession.
Everybody’s got an empty space. An
absence. Now, no matter how they
try filling it- maybe you're a
juicehead, a gash hound, a fat lady
eats every time she feels something
-it’'s the same vacant space. And
that is the silence of God. And it
doesn’t go away. Everybody wants a
cathartic narrative for it. The
guilty especially. And everybody's
guilty... You know that.

INT. LAURIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 53

Living room of Laurie’s house, as she and Cohle sit on the
couch, bathed in the light of the television-- She’s curled
against his side-- Cohle drinking a beer--

His face is somewhat tense, introverted-- Laurie watches the
television, some innocuous reality TV-- Cohle looks at the top of
her hair, the television, the walls--

He seems like a man being slowly, quietly tortured by his
surroundings--

INT. DINING AREA, HART HOME - NIGHT 54
Hart sits at table eating with his family. Maggie (39)

serves. Macie is 13, bubbly, girly, and Audrey, 16, dresses
grungy, frowns at her food-- WALL CALENDAR - 2002--

HART
I’m just trying to understand,
babe... I mean, what’re you going

for, here? What’s the message?
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 23.

AUDREY
There is no message. It’s just me.

HART
What’s you? Your clothes? Your
hair? I mean, I look at Macie, and--

AUDREY
Women don’t have to look like you
want them to.

HART
I agree. I’m not talking about
‘women,’ I’m talking about my
teenage daughter, and I’m not
telling you what to wear. I’m just
doing my best to understand...

AUDREY
Who told you you had to understand?
Why would you?

Hart ducks it; knows she has his number-- Turns to Macie as
Maggie enters, sits--

HART
(to Macie)
Mom said you made cheerleader?

MACIE
There were like, ten girls who
didn’t get it.

HART
They have eighth-grade cheerleaders?

MAGGIE
Same way there’s football players.

AUDREY
(re potatoes, Macie)
Why’re you taking more? You’re just
gonna throw them up.

MACIE
Shut up. Why don’t you go blow a
basketball player, suicide girl?

MAGGIE
Macie!-- Apologize!

HART
--What the hell does that mean?
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 24.

Looking between the girls, who glance at one another, then
face down, pick at their food in a shrinking, demure way that
prohibits his pressing the matter-- But he is enraged--

HART (CONT'D)
(to Audrey)
What does that mean?

MAGGIE
Let it go. Dinner’s not the time
for you to suddenly get particular.

HART
I’'m- What? I am the Man of this
family. My-my daughter makes a
comment like that- I’m-

MAGGIE
.»..-You’re as dramatic as them. Drop
it, Marty.

HART
What’s it mean?

AUDREY
--Why don’t you ask her what I
meant? Huh? It means my sister's a
bitch, that’s all.

The girls answer his lead, but the level of emotion and
confrontation is too much for Marty-- He flips stances--

HART
...-The hell? Christ, can’t we just
have dinner? Your mom made us a
nice meal, we- we’re not supposed
to be like this--

No one buys his sentimental platitudes, since his actions don’t
embody them-- The girls stay silent--

MAGGIE
...-You have to be the way you want
your children to behave.

Girls see the exchange, watch-- He doesn’t reply-- Everyone
picks at their food, silverware against china--

HART
...Hear your grades are good.

AUDREY
That’s because school’s a joke.
55

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 25.
HART
...-Terrific. Great news.
He rises abruptly, takes his plate into the living room--
The women stay at the table-- SOUND of TV turning on--
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 55
Hart, 52--
HART
Rust’s girl, uh, Laurie. She
became, like, Chief of something,
Lafayette General. I think.
GILBOUGH

You know what happened there?
Between them.

HART
What always happens between men and
women... Reality.

(beat)
My understanding, from Maggie. They
wanted different things. You’d have
to ask him.

PAPANIA
.+.-When do you think things started
to, how you put it, change again,
with Detective Cohle?

HART
..-Maybe, early on in 2002. But it
was his life. Mine was steady. Like
I say.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 56
Cohle, 49-- Gilbough listening closely--

COHLE
Years... “Time is a flat circle.”
You know anything about M-brane
theory, detectives?

Papania rolls eyes-- Gilbough shakes his head slowly-- Cohle
uses a beer can to illustrate, tracing the can’s surface,
beyond it--
57

58

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/1

COHLE (CONT'D)

It’s like, in this universe, our
consciousness has to process time
linearly, forward. But outside our
spacetime, from what would be a
fourth-dimensional perspective,
time wouldn’t exist. And from that
vantage, could we attain it, we’d
see--

A sudden display of strength: between two hands, Cohle

crushes the can to a flat disc--

COHLE (CONT'D)

Our spacetime would look flattened,
like a single sculpture, with
matter in a superposition of every
place it ever occupied. Our
sentience just cycles through our
lives like carts on a track.

He lights a cigarette, idly arranges the beer-can men
it’s now four surrounding one, holds up the flat disc

COHLE (CONT'D)
Everything outside our dimension,
see, that’s eternity. Eternity,
looking down at us. To us, it’s a
sphere. To them, it’s a circle.
He twists the disc slowly in front his eyes-- Beat--

GILBOUGH
Mr. Cohle... What happened in 2002?

Cohle’s eyes lock with his--
INT. ABBEVILLE PD - DAY

TWO PD DETECTIVES and SERGEANT observe Cohle working a

with an opaque glass eye. Cohle holds a thick file on Francis,

leafing through the case--

COHLE
They think you’re the drug store
robber, Francis. Killed two people
in Livingston. Call you ‘The
Southern-Fried Pharmacy Firearms
Fiend.’
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 27.

FRANCIS
..-No, sir.

Cohle studies him-- Francis doesn’t say anything, sweats--

COHLE

Stuff they got now, man.
Fingerprints. DNA. You'd have to be
some kinda genius to get around all
that.

(leans in)
And you ain’t no kinda genius, are
you? Best play for you, plead
impairment. You know what that
means? Means you can’t be held
accountable for your actions.

FRANCIS
-.-I don’t think I should be
blamed, entirely, I mean. What I
done under the influence of
anything.

COHLE
I’m not saying you should be
either. Shit, man. PCP, one time,
famous case. Guy cut off his own
face.

FRANCIS
...F’real?

COHLE
Oh yeah. That and meth? If that
ain’t an insanity defense, I don’t
know what is. I mean, how they
gonna call a man not on anything
insane, he does something crazy.
But a man’s on something makes him
crazy, that’s sane? Works both
ways.

FRANCIS
...Yeah... Exactly. I mean, I’m not
even saying I remember. I was so
shit-hammered...

COHLE
.-.I’d take that play. Insanity
defense... But the amnesia thing
won't help. See, cause you sobered
up.

(MORE)
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 28.

COHLE (CONT'D)
So now, you being in your right
mind- best way for you to show the
difference between that man and
this one, is to show shock. Terror
and remorse... This ‘I can’t
remember’ shit. You gotta do
better. You gotta let ‘em clear the
case, show shame, penitence...

FRANCIS
.--I am. I do. I’m scared, sir...
COHLE
Hhn. You remember what you told the
pharmacist?
FRANCIS

.-."Give me everything”...

COHLE
There you go. And you’re sorry,
aren’t you?

FRANCIS
Yeah. Yeah... I’m ill...

COHLE
You see what you just did? You just
copped to a double murder. They got
you now.

Guy stiffens, thinks like a trapped animal and abruptly makes
a decision, leans close to Cohle, as though in confidence--

FRANCIS
I wanna deal. I know things.

COHLE
Like what?

FRANCIS
Like, I know who you are. That
woman in the woods, way back. The
antlers.

Cohle’s eyes widen, piqued--
COHLE

That don’t mean nothing. That was
in the papers. You ain’t got shit.

COHLE
Ain't nobody did that killing’s
still alive, boy. And you don’t

people, know about him. But I wanna
deal.

COHLE

FRANCIS
Deal with me for them murders... I
tell you about The Yellow King.

collar--

Gimme a name. Give me a fucking

Cohle slams him into the wall, pressing his windpipe--

SERGEANT
You got the confession, then you
made it inadmissable--

COHLE
What’re you doing? He’s still
talking--

DETECTIVE 2
We don’t treat our suspects like
that here--

DETECTIVE 1
He’s shucking and jiving you,
Detective. He knows who you are.

COHLE
You called me in--
(calms )
.--Hold on. Hold on, I want to talk
to him--

DETECTIVE 2
We'll let you know, we need
anything else.

SERGEANT
You can visit the prisoner when you
calm down, request further
interview. We appreciate the
assist.

DETECTIVE 1
Come on--

TWO PATROLMEN pass by to take Francis to holding-- One of
them is Childress, who heard the conversation-—

COHLE
What’s going on here?

SERGEANT
We gotta salvage a double-murder
confession, is what's going on. If
he wasn’t just running you, you’1l
get anything we get... You have my
word.

Cohle’s frustrated, mind spinning with what Francis said-- He
clocks the other detectives, shakes the Sergeant’s hand--

Cohle walking from the dining area to kitchen with
hand, fleeing a conversation behind him, as he and
clean up after dinner--

LAURIE
.-.I’m not saying we have to decide
now. It’s just a subject...

They meet in the KITCHEN, Cohle sets plates down--

COHLE
I’m saying. As a subject. I closed
that for myself.

LAURIE
...Baby, I know how you feel.
Because of what happened. I do.

COHLE
...It’s not that.

LAURIE
Of course it is, no matter what you
say. And I’m saying. There might be a
kind of healing in this for you.

COHLE
There’s nothing to heal, Laurie...
It's a philosophical decision.

Laurie

She calls him out, blocking his exit from the kitchen--

LAURIE
Bullshit. If you're going to live...
being so honest. Without illusion, you
said. Then you can’t be serious. If you
really think the reason you don’t want
children is philosophical, you are a- a
blind man describing an elephant...

COHLE

LAURIE (CONT'D)
...Is it you don’t-- with me?
...-You don’t love me that way?

He freezes a half-second too long-- He wants to be a good man,
but that word still registers a suspicious abstraction--

COHLE
No. It’s not about you. I wouldn’t
have children with anyone, Laurie.
I'm sorry...

He passes her, enters the living room, where something
catches his eye... He pauses beside a shelf, looks at it, as
Laurie stands in kitchen doorway--

COHLE POV -- he stares at the framed Lafayette Advertiser
PHOTO of him and Hart, the ‘Hero Cops’ headline-- His own
face in the glass, seven years later--

LAURIE

...A seven-year old picture’s more
important than this discussion?

(beat)
You've got such good eyes for
detail, Rust. The seams in
everything and all the cracks. But
you miss a shit-ton of what's
obvious.

COHLE
...What’ve I missed?

LAURIE
How did you think this would sit
with me? You heard me talk about
it... Did you think I would just be
content to erase any hopes for that
area of my life? For being a
mother?

Without really looking at her--

COHLE
...No. I guess I never expected you
to do that.

Hurts her, that he’d allowed his intentions’
misinterpretation--

LAURIE
..-Are you just-- I don’t know if
you're mostly good, and just a coward.
Or if you’re an asshole, and just a
little smarter than most.
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 33.

COHLE
.-.I’d hate to call that one.

She walks out, and he turns--

COHLE (CONT'D)

He means it, but his mind is almost entirely elsewhere. BACK
to his reflection over the framed newspaper-- The PHOTO--

63 INT. HART’S CAR - NIGHT 63

Late night. Martin Hart parked at home with Audrey in the
car. SILENCE-- Audrey’s lipstick and makeup is badly smeared,
ashamed and Marty drives, furious--

AUDREY
--Dad...

HART
Tell it to your mother.

He glances at her with raw hate that makes her wither with
its disgust-- They get out--

64 INT. HART HOME - NIGHT 64

In her robe and nightgown, Maggie is waiting in the foyer as
Marty and Audrey enter-- Maggie was also awoken from sleep
and has been waiting for Hart and Audrey to come home--

HART
Deputy found her parked in a car.
With two boys.

MAGGIE
(to Audrey)
What?

HART
In states of undress... You know,
like fucking.

Audrey shrinks, as Maggie looks at her shocked and maybe
horrified--

Audrey. My God. Look at me. Look at

HART
‘Thinking?’ What the fuck is wrong
with you? Or is this one of those
things I’1l never understand. You

He slaps her-- She runs to her room-- He’s instantly ashamed
of the act, frozen with fear, guilt-- Maggie’s aghast... She
follows Audrey--

INT. HALLWAY, HART HOME - NIGHT 65

MACIE (14), watches from a crack in her door as Audrey storms
by in tears, hitting Macie’s door--

MACIE

Maggie following behind as Audrey’s door slams, locks--

MAGGIE

Go to bed. This isn’t to do with
you.

Macie smirks to herself, into her PHONE, ‘My slut sister’--
She shuts her door as her mother knocks on Audrey’s--

MAGGIE (CONT'D)

Marty hasn’t moved, looks at his hands, guilt-ridden-- Then,
to save himself, through some inner rationale, he converts
that guilt into righteousness-- He’s the wronged party--

INT. KITCHEN, HART HOME - NIGHT 67

Marty enters the kitchen-- Digs around in a cabinet under the
sink, pulling out junk and old cleansers until--

He finds a dusty, old bottle of Jamesons, half-full-- Pours
himself a tall drink--

INT. LOCKER ROOM, HOMICIDE, STATE PD - DAY 68

Martin dresses-- Younger men, detectives, mill around him--
He’s tired, studies his hands, knuckles on one hand bruised,
scraped (will learn why next ep.)-- Looks to his belt, the
RODEO BUCKLE on it dated ‘82--

At the BATHROOM MIRROR above the sink, he checks the skin
beneath his chin, the thinning hairline; tries a half-ass
comb-over, comb-down, fuck it--

Hart leaves the mirror, unsatisfied with it-- OVERLAP these
images with first dialogue of next scene--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 69
Cohle, 49, twisting the flat beer-can like a doubloon--

COHLE
In eternity, where there’s no time,
everything is eternal. Nothing can

time to grow the things it would
kill... And you are reborn, but
into the same life you’ve always
been born into.

He draws a figure-eight infinity symbol around the can-men--

COHLE (CONT'D)
...-How many times have we had this
conversation, Detectives? Who
knows? We can never remember our

WALKING down a hallway of HOLDING CELLS with PD--
SERGEANT
We did take his belt. Shoelaces

beneath the bars-- YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE over the door. All
stand before the cell, see--

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 37.

Guy Francis’s body is slumped at a rear corner, bent around the
post of his bunk, where a piece has been cut and bent outward a
long time ago, making a small, hooked tooth--

Cohle stares through the bars, Francis’s wrists gouged and bled
out, pooling at dips in the cement--

SERGEANT (CONT’D)
He knew what he was looking at for
the double-murder. Guess he thought
about it, made a choice.

COHLE
You got camera feeds?

SERGEANT
Yes we do. They cover the hallway.
Not the cells.

COHLE
I want to see it.

SERGEANT
You wanna modify your tone,
Detective? Or you wanna obtain a
subpoena?

HART
Sorry. Chief, if we could get a
look, maybe get us out your hair
quicker.

SERGEANT
...It’s under review with our
internal affairs division, but I’m
sure they’d let you have a look, you
ask them as nice as you did me.

Cohle fumes as Hart leads him away, looking at Francis’s dead body
slumped in the cell, the dark river flowed out it...

INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY 73

Cohle leans past an IA INVESTIGATOR and TECHNICIAN watching the
holding area’s camera footage-- FAST-FORWARDING through footage
of empty holding area for some time-- Francis is taken out his

COHLE
Stop. What was that?

IA INVESTIGATOR
«He took a phone call at 7:15.

a little trail of black starts flowing out--

IA INVESTIGATOR (CONT'D)
That’s it. Three hours of
nothing... till you see the blood.

COHLE
«+.-You got audio? Sound.

TECH
No. Just the vid.

COHLE
...So we don’t know what somebody
might’ve told him, on that phone
call. We need to see your logs--

He looks between the PD men and Hart, appearing paranoid--
EXT. PHONE BOOTH / DEFUNCT GAS STATION - DAY 74

An abandoned GAS STATION on the prairie, convenience store
empty, gas pumps ripped out-- A DEPUTY stands with Cohle and Hart
outside a PHONE BOOTH on the edge of the lot--

Cohle looks the phone over, the desolation--

COHLE
...Try to take prints. No kind of
lawyer calls from here.
(to deputy)
Francis have relatives?

DEPUTY
Yeah. Sisters, a few nieces and
nephews.

HART

-..-Connects to his suicide?

COHLE
Maybe somebody told him something.
Gave him no choice...

That doesn’t sound very plausible to Hart or the Deputy--

INT. MOVING, CID CAR - DAY 75

Hart drives he and Cohle away toward the interstate-- Cohle stares
out the window, thinks-- Hart clocks that Cohle is in his state of
obsessive thought--

HART
You really think he could've been
serious, about having something?
..-And if so, then what?

Implications: Conspiracy? We got the wrong man seven years
ago..?

COHLE
..-Reggie Ledoux deserved to die,
Marty. That’s justice. But I’m not
ruling out other agencies.

HART
What’s that mean?

COHLE
Francis and Charlie Lange both said
the Yellow King. Dora Lange said
Yellow King.

HART
Why haven’t we heard anything?

COHLE
.»..You ever wonder why that task
force was so hot to take the case,
back in ‘95?
Hart doesn’t respond, doesn’t like the gears in Cohle’s eyes--
EXT. HIGHWAY, SOUTH LOUISIANA - DAY 76

The CID car passes again through the wilderness cut with
asphalt--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 77
Hart, 52--

GILBOUGH
Did he mention Billy Lee Tuttle?

HART
..-You know that he did.
78

79

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 40.

PAPANIA
Tuttle died a couple years back.
2010.

HART

Yeah. What was it? Mixed
medications? So what.

GILBOUGH
Not long after Cohle turned back up
in Louisiana.

HART
Alright. Fuck this. Fuck it right
now. You tell me why you’re all
over Rust. Or I walk.

GILBOUGH
..-His record. His reports. His
stories. They don’t add up.

HART
So talk to him already. Stop
pissing in my ear.

PAPANIA
We did.

HART
You did? Huh.

GILBOUGH
What?

HART

If you two talked to Rust, you
didn’t get a read on him. He was
getting a read on you.

OFF Hart, feeling superior to his interviewers--

EXT. MALL, LAFAYETTE - DAY 78
Hart, 42, walks through outdoor MALL with a bulky Walgreen's

bag in hand, looking at an ad torn from the paper, pictures of
cell phones-- He pauses in the bustle of shoppers, looks around,
finds the CELL PHONE STORE across the way--

INT. CELL PHONE STORE - DAY 79
Hart lugs the Walgreen's bag, looks at various phones on display

until a salesgirl, BETH (23), approaches him-- As she does, she
seems to be taken with something about his appearance, his face--
80

81

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 41.

BETH
Can I help you with anything, sir?

HART
Oh, yeah. Please. I’m just looking
for this one...

He indicates a picture from the newspaper ad; she glances at
him while checking the ad, lets him catch her looking--

BETH
Right over here. I’ve been seeing
that ad all day.
She leads him over to the item and hands it to him--
HART
...It’s pretty easy to work, huh? I
don’t want anything too fancy...

BETH
It’s easy... Did you want a camera?

Hart thinks it over, looking at the phone box--

HART
Yeah, sure. Good.

Beth glances at his face, his WEDDING RING, the bulky Walgreen's
bag-- NOTICE the bag is full of THREE BOXES of tampons--

BETH
This has one. It’s easy--

EXT. MALL, LAFAYETTE - DAY 80
Later. Walking out the mall, looking at the phone’s box-- Hart
sees he is passing a SUBURBAN BAR-- On the bar’s TV, ESPN is
on--

He looks at his watch, the Walgreen’s bag--

HART
«Fuck it...

He walks into the bar--

INT. ARCHIVES, STATE PD - DAY 81
Cohle sits before a computer with a small stack of thin
folders-- Each one containing Missing Persons-- Notice the

reports are either marked ‘made _in error’ or simply contain no
investigative information, their case files empty--
82

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 42.

He’s copying a list of those names on his legal pad--
INT. SUBURBAN BAR - DAY 82

Hart sits at the bar with a beer, his second, new phone
unwrapped, almost too tiny for his fingers-- He watches between it
and the game on TV, his Walgreen’s bag on the stool beside him--

BETH
(re bag)
Big weekend planned?

He looks up to see Beth standing beside him--

HART
(realizing bag)
Huh? Oh. Hah. Yeah... Looking
forward to it...

He continues to work at the phone-- Can’t quite take his eyes
off her as she leans over the bar, orders a martini, waits--

BETH

»..-You’re a cop, aren’t you?
HART

You see my badge at check-out?
BETH

No. Tell you the truth... I think I

saw you before. Years back.

HART
You get in trouble?

BETH
No. You came around this place I
was staying, asking about a girl...

HART
Oh. ...My name’s Marty.

She takes his hand, happy and inviting, young. We may not
realize it yet, but this is the young prostitute at the ‘ranch’
whom Hart met in ep. 2--

BETH
Beth. I like your belt buckle. You
were a bullrider?

He moves his bag to the floor, and she joins him, receiving her
drink--

84

85

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 43.
HART
Oh, yeah. SBC champs, ‘82.

BETH
I love bullriding.

He grins, almost tense, drinks--
EXT. MOVING, COHLE’S TRUCK, RURAL ROAD - DAY 83

Cohle drives down a rural road, passing fields, deep forests
with dread-- He sees something, slows down, almost stopping--

Out the window, he sees the old BILLBOARD still stands, seen in
ep. 1, mildewed, bleached by the sun, a GIRL’S PORTRAIT and a
legend: ‘10/11/87: DO YOU KNOW WHO KILLED ME? CALL 800-976-5236

 

REWARD’-- Sun has faded the girl’s face so that it’s a large
void, blank-- Cohle passes it slowly, staring--

EXT. CANE FIELDS —- DAY 84

The CANE FIELDS seen in ep 1, the former Dora Lange crime
scene. Cohle, 39, alone, crosses the field, toward the single
OAK TREE at its center--

Cohle enters the small clearing around the oak where they
found Dora Lange’s body seven years ago, sees--

The TREE hosts a SMALL ALTAR-- A half-dozen of the STICK
LATTICEWORKS posted around it, a warped spiral of wood--

From a surrounding vantage, it appears the stick sculptures
or something within the cane observes him--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 85

2012. ON a new CRIME SCENE FILE-- B&W, COLOR PHOTOS of the
body from Lake Charles, a brief bio on the deceased
‘STEPHANIE KORDISH’-- DETAILS in pictures, in Cohle’s EYES as
he leafs through them--

To INVESTIGATIVE REPORT -- ‘Deceased reported missing--’ ‘LCP
High School’-- Surface info--
It’s thin--
COHLE
...-This’s it? Really? Hell, I know
this.
GILBOUGH

What we have. So far.
86

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 44.

PAPANIA
Maybe you can stop dancing with us.
Start talking about what you really
been up to. How you spend your
time.

Gilbough snaps a look at Papania: too far-- Cohle closes the

file, phenomenonally unimpressed.

COHLE
I already told you how I spend my
time.
PAPANIA
Except you been bullshitting us all
day.
Gilbough irritated--
GILBOUGH

.-.’Scuse us, one more time.

Gilbough rises-- Papania opens door, and both walk out,

leaving Rust alone with new file and tin can men--

INT. STATE CID - DAY

86

FOLLOW Gilbough and Papania out the interview room, away from

its line of sight--

GILBOUGH
Shouldn't have gone at him like
that, Tom.

PAPANA

Maybe. Alright. But he’s been

spinning our tops since he walked

in. Let’s take it to real street.
Their MAJOR (MARKAM, 48) meets them--

MARKAM
...Anything?

Papania and Gilbough look between one another--

GILBOUGH
He’s not right.

PAPANIA
He’s not close to right. Come on.

Gilbough weighs where they were against where Papania
them--

left
87

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 45.

GILBOUGH
...We want to go for it.

MARKAM
We can’t hold him, what you got. He
knows it.

PAPANIA
We taken this far as we can. He’s a
sociopath with a thesaurus.

GILBOUGH
‘95 to now. He pulls it all
together, doesn’t he..? He’s the
missing piece. He set the guys up
in ‘95. Pushed it on the two
pedophiles.

MARKAM
.«+-You don’t get an admission, you
blown it. He’1ll walk, maybe leave
the state.

The two detectives look between each other--

GILBOUGH
.--.We’ll get it.

PAPANIA
Fucking right we’ll get it.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 87

Gilbough and Papania enter room-- Gilbough has a new PHOTO he
puts down in front of Cohle--

GILBOUGH
This’s from our crime scene. Once
folks got word.

ON PHOTO-- A CROWD SCENE in a rural area, all standing behind
CRIME SCENE TAPE--

GILBOUGH (0.S.) (CONT’D)
.+.-You recognize anybody in there?

PUSH IN on photo’s faces-- Among the crowd of onlookers
stands RUSTIN COHLE--

PAPANIA
Lake Charles is a bit out of the
way for you, huh?
"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 46.

COHLE
..-How is it you kept her out the
papers?

No answer-—

COHLE (CONT'D)
Maybe you got friends in high
places.

PAPANIA
Your truck and a man fitting your
description were spotted in the
vicinity of our scene, five times,
by five different people, over the
last month.

Cohle’s eyes go dark, looking up at his questioners--
88 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 88

Gilbough and Papania now work Hart, 52-- Who has the CROWD
PHOTO that features Rust at the crime scene--

GILBOUGH
Now, besides people seeing him and
his truck around the location for
weeks, you know he was off the
grid, after he left in ‘02? Doesn’t
show up anywhere till 2010,
Louisiana. Gets his driver’s
license renewed. Nobody knows what
he’s been up to, meantime.

PAPANIA
He’s got a storage shed near Church
Point. He won’t let us see what’s
inside.

On Hart’s face, thinking these things over, not believing it--
89 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 89
Cohle, 49--

COHLE
Fuck no you can’t look at my
storage unit. Get a warrant.
Christ. Try working a case.

GILBOUGH
We're working it. How it works for
us is we think, way back, you put
the case on Rianne Olivier.

(MORE)
90

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 47.

GILBOUGH (CONT'D)
Put it on her old boyfriend. I
don’t know, maybe the Ledoux boys
knew you... Maybe you traveled the
same circles. Same hobbies. Maybe
they had something on you.

Cohle doesn’t respond, studies his accusers like prey--
PAPANA

You just kept pulling the right old
murders, take the case where you

wanted.

GILBOUGH
You're a juicer. You ever black
out?

PAPANIA
Ever wake up, don’t remember what
you did?

Now Cohle rises, moves to the door--

COHLE
You think you can arrest me, go
ahead. You wanna follow me, go
ahead. You wanna see something, get
a warrant. Beyond that, thanks for
the beer. Fuck off. Company men.

Cohle exits the interview room, leaving the detectives
stupified, furious--

PAPANIA
.--Shit. Maynard. We'll keep on
him. This ain’t over.

Gilbough, so tightly wound, for the first time shows emotion--
SNAPS and throws an old typewriter in a rage--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 90

Gilbough and Papania make their case to Hart, 52-- He’s
looking at PHOTOS of the new murder, the crowd photo--

GILBOUGH
He bartends four days a week, this
roadhouse. Has a little apartment
behind it. No other accounting of
his time.

PAPANIA
Says he drinks.

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13

HART
...You’re wrong. Nobody could
change that much. You are dead
fucking wrong.

GILBOUGH
Hey. You been telling us, all day,
about the kind of shit he’d think
up. Way he’d talk. We got a good
earful of that, too.

PAPANIA
You gonna tell me that’s a stable
individual? Left a burn-out, junkie
rumors. You think ten years on the
sauce’s made him more reasonable?
Think about this. You said it. He’d
been there three months.

EXT. CANE FIELDS —- DAY

48.

91

FLASHBACK from early in the first ep., Cohle and Hart being led by

a sheriff's deputy through the field, toward the

GILBOUGH (V.O.)
.--And you two catch a heater like
you never had before or since...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Hart, 52,

listens--

GILBOUGH
One that he shines on. You saying
he did such a great job. Didn’t he
get you every bit of evidence?
Didn't he push you where he wanted
it to go?

PAPANIA

He brought you Rianne Olivier.
GILBOUGH

She wasn’t one of Ledoux’s... She

was one of his.

Marty’s face bleaches, staring at the new PHOTOS--

INT. SQUAD ROOM, STATE POLICE HQ - DAY

INT. COHLE’S APT - NIGHT 94

In Cohle’'s old apartment, the first time Hart saw it-- The
STACKS of homicide literature--

EXT. STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT 95

2012, at a STORAGE FACILITY, Cohle, 49, walks a narrow concrete
strip between rows of storage units-- He stops before a mid-sized
one, looks over his shoulders, checking for tails-—-

PAPANIA (V.O.)
Why can’t we see what he keeps in
storage?

Cohle unlocks the padlock and door-lock on the UNIT, lifts the
metal doorway open and slips under, inside-- Closes and locks it
from inside. A LIGHT comes on, filling the cracks around the door,
framing it in the darkness--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 96
Hart, 52, listens, increasingly paranoid--

PAPANIA
What'd he say? ‘Life is a disease’?

GILBOUGH
When he heard the Abbeville
prisoner, Francis, knew something,
he got on it. He shut it down.

PAPANIA
You ever thought if he made that
phone call to the prisoner? Like, I
dunno: the guy was trying to
blackmail him...

GILBOUGH
He got back on it, too, didn’t he?
The idea that the Lange killer was
still out there?

Hart pauses a few beats, sweating, taking it all in--

HART
Yeah... Yeah, he did...

GILBOUGH
Looking for a new patsy, maybe.

Mutual looks as Hart sits with this--
EXT. PELICAN ISLAND, LOUISIANA - DAY 97

2002. Cohle’s truck travels down the rural road leading into
the desolation of PELICAN ISLAND--

HART 2012 (V.O.)
By the time I knew what Rust was
doing, it was too late...

EXT. LIGHT OF THE WAY ACADEMY - DAY 98

39, Cohle steps out his truck, stands before the Light of the
Way Academy, now even more rundown than before; seven hurricane
seasons partially demolished the place, roofs sinking, its yard
an overgrown tangle of jungle grass, no groundskeeping in a long
time...

Cohle holds in his hand Rianne Olivier’s OLD YEARBOOK, the cheap,
stapled job-- COHLE’S MISSING PERSONS LIST is used as a
bookmark, opening the yearbook onto student PHOTOS-- Rianne
Olivier’s picture circled in red by him--

Cohle walks toward the entrance--
INT. LIGHT OF THE WAY ACADEMY - DAY 99

Cohle enters the darkened, moldering building. Damp, seedy
light through some broken windows-- Glass underfoot-- Old
water stains--

Cohle walks through the dim-lit wreckage and piles of debris,
faded crosses and evangelical mottos on the wall. Faded
acrylic cherubs with hands over eyes, ears, and mouth- see
no, hear no, say no-- style looks familiar--

Cohle’s flashlight cuts through the dim. A CLASSROOM, moldering,
generic Christian elements on the wall--

He climbs creaky, sagging steps, peeling walls, pale light
leaking through--

HART 2012 (V.O.)
Look, you’re giving me a lot to
absorb.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 100
Hart, 52, facing the other two detectives--
PAPANIA

Goddamn right it’s a lot to absorb.
So help us out.
101

"CH. 5: THE SECRET FATE OF ALL LIFE" - 5/12/13 51.

GILBOUGH
Whatever you can tell us. From when he
got back on the Lange killer till you
two had your... altercation.

PAPANIA
...Whatever that was about.

Hart bristles at something patronizing in the reference--
Still troubled by what he’s learned of Cohle, he thinks--

INT. LIGHT OF THE WAY ACADEMY / CLASSROOM - DAY 101
39, Cohle ascends the second floor of the former school-- A row
of GLASS DISPLAY SHELVES, most fallen off, a moldering
CLASSROOM-- He sweeps with his flashlight--

SEES in the beam, OLD STUDENT DESKS-- Occupying a number of
seats are TWIG LATTICEWORKS, some very old, cobwebbed--

The WALLS around the room are painted to look like a cypress
forest beneath a purple sky with black stars--

He turns to the room’s window--

PULL BACK through broken window as MUSIC RISES, ‘ELI’ b
Bosnian Rainbows-- Pulling back to the decrepit exterior of
school, and Cohle’s face through the broken window--

FADE TO BLACK.
