Title Card: The Beginning

EXT. THE GARDEN OF EDEN - DAY

Almost a montage:

A huge black SNAKE slips along a tree branch.

The Snake’s head whispers into EVE’s ear.

A hand, Eve’s, picks an apple from a tree. She takes a bite.
Grins. Passes it to ADAM. (They are both tastefully naked. I

would not make them white people.) Adam also takes a bite...

And then he grins lecherously at Eve. Tasteful blackout...
Time lapse...

A rumble of supernatural THUNDER!

An angel in white robes (AZIRAPHALE but we can’t see his
face), holding a flaming sword, gestures impressively towards
an exit gate: they have to leave...

EXT. OUTSIDE THE GARDEN OF EDEN - DAY

The Garden is walled. Inside, a perfect place of greenery.
Outside, something more like a desert or an African plain.

Adam and Eve, now wearing leaf-based clothes, in tears, are
running, desperately away from the Garden. Adam is holding
something we cannot see. Eve is pregnant.

Animals roar...

EXT. ON THE WALL OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN - DAY

Watching Adam and Eve leave, are the angel, AZIRAPHALE, and
beside him, on a tree, a very, very large black SNAKE. The
Snake HISSES loudly.

AZIRAPHALE
Sorry. What was that?
The snake TRANSMUTES into a male Demon. He’s dressed in black
robes, as opposed to the Angel’s white robes, and his eyes
look like the eyes of a snake. (IF WE DO WINGS his are grey
feathers, the angel’s are white.)

CROWLEY
I said, Well, that one went down
like a lead balloon.

AZIRAPHALE
Oh. Yes, it did, rather.

CROWLEY
Bit of an overreaction, if you ask
me. First offense and everything.
And I can’t see what’s so bad about
knowing the difference between good
and evil, anyway.

AZIRAPHALE
It must BE bad. Otherwise you
wouldn't have tempted them into it.

CROWLEY
They just said, Get up there and
make some trouble. So I did.

AZIRAPHALE
Obviously. You’re a demon. It’s
what you do.

CROWLEY
Not very subtle of Him, though.
Fruit tree in the middle of a
garden, with a don’t touch sign. If
He really didn’t want them to eat
the apples, He could have put it on
the moon.

AZIRAPHALE
Best not to speculate. It’s all
part of the ineffable plan. I don’t
like the look of that weather.

Low rumble of non-supernatural thunder on the horizon.

CROWLEY
Didn't you have a flaming sword?

AZIRAPHALE
Er...
CROWLEY
You did. It was flaming like
anything. What happened to it?

AZIRAPHALE
Er...

CROWLEY
Lost it, have you?

AZIRAPHALE
(mutters inaudibly)
I gave it away.

CROWLEY
You what?

AZIRAPHALE
I gave it away. They looked so
miserable. And there are vicious
animals, and it’s going to be cold
out there, and she’s expecting
already, and I said, here you go,
flaming sword, don’t thank me, and
don’t let the sun go down on you
here.... I do hope I didn’t do the
wrong thing.

CROWLEY
You’re an angel. How can you do the
wrong thing?

AZIRAPHALE
It’s been bothering me.

In the distance, Adam uses the flaming sword on some poor
lion. Aziraphale winces. NB it’s pronounced Azeerafail.

CROWLEY
...I’ve been worrying too. What if
I did the right thing, with the
whole eat-the-apple business. A
demon can get into a lot of trouble
for doing the right thing. Funny if
we both got it wrong, eh?

AZIRAPHALE
Not really. Not funny at all.

The Thunderstorm begins in earnest.
TITLE CARD: ELEVEN YEARS AGO.

Buddy Holly’s song “Every Day” plays, beginning with a tick
tick tick and... Every day, it's a-getting closer...

EXT. SOHO - AFTERNOON

Establishing shot of Aziraphale’s Bookshop. It’s a run-down
Secondhand/antiquarian Bookshop of the kind you used to see
lots of in London...

INT. AZIRAPHALE’S BOOKSHOP - AFTERNOON

AZIRAPHALE is answering the phone. He has not changed since
we saw him as an angel. He looks like a happy, affluent, used-
book dealer. He’s a kind-looking gentleman whose sartorial
style runs to bow-ties. He thinks a little tartan is nifty,
and would use the world nifty with pride. His bookshop is
chaotic, crowded, glorious, dusty. He is sitting at a table
at a desk piled high with books.

AZIRAPHALE
First edition of Gibbons’ Decline
and Fall? Yes, I definitely have a
set here somewhere. Six volumes,
let me see, 1776... No, I don’t
know where it is, but you’re
welcome to come in and have a root
around. And if I come across it, I
could telephone you.

He writes down a phone number.

AZIRAPHALE (CONT'D)
Happy to help.

He puts down the phone. Makes an “I’m a bit naughty but am
profoundly lovable” face (a la Boris Johnson). Sits back in
his chair, returns to reading his copy of Gibbons’s Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire volume I, and drops the phone
number in the bin.

CUT TO:

EXT. BT TOWER - EVENING

It’s 7:30pm in Midsummer, the streetlights are going on, and
people are leaving their offices. One person is going to
work: CROWLEY is wearing stylish very black sunglasses, and a
very nice suit. He is carrying a clipboard and a Thermos
flask.
His hairstyle is perfect for somewhere around a decade ago.
He glances around a little theatrically. He puts on a dayglo
orange donkey jacket.

He hangs an Identity Card on a lanyard around his neck. Then
he walks in to the BT Tower building lobby.

INT. BT TOWER LOBBY - EVENING

A security desk. Behind it, a bored female SECURITY GUARD
does a crossword.

CROWLEY
Rataway Pest Control.

SECURITY GUARD
I thought your lot weren’t due in
until tomorrow morning.

CROWLEY
Preliminary inspection. Traps go
down tomorrow. My job’s to tell
them where.

SECURITY GUARD
Bloody everywhere. I’ve never seen
anything like it. I put down a tuna
sandwich yesterday, never saw it
again. Health and safety closed off
the upper floors as a health hazard
until you lot get here.

INT. BT TOWER LIFT - NIGHT
Crowley and another Security Guard are in the lift.

GUARD 2
Sunglasses?

CROWLEY
It’s my eyes.

GUARD 2
I'm afraid I’m not going to be able
to let you wander around on your
own up here. Unescorted. Lot of
communications go through here. All
the mobile phone services, for a
start.

CROWLEY
Is that right?
INT. TOP FLOOR BT TOWER. LIFT - NIGHT

The lift dings, and Crowley and the Guard step out. The floor
is empty. Night lighting. But we hear a SCRATCHING.

Crowley looks around.

Every surface is alive. A nose. Sharp teeth. A twitch of a
tail. RATS. Hundreds of them! Tiny sinister red eyes glowing
at us from all over. A beat, then they move -- they are
coming towards us! The Guard steps back into the lift.

GUARD 2
You know. I’m just going to wait
here.

CROWLEY

I don’t blame you.

The lift door closes. Crowley walks forward. He takes out his
thermos, unscrews the top, pours himself a cup of steaming
tea.

And Crowley... smiles.
CROWLEY (CONT'D)
Beautiful job! Thank you all, so
much men!
A lady rat chirps angrily.
CROWLEY (CONT'D)
And, yes, obviously, ladies too.

Nice job! You can all go home. And,
yeah, stay cool.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

He walks into a room filled with computer and BT equipment.
All of it old-fashioned and out-dated equipment: the
computers of yesteryear, and some cables.

Lots of green and red lights flashing.

Crowley pours his tea onto the unit. Then he pours the rest
of the tea from the thermos.

All around the room CONSOLE Lights start to flicker.
Something electronic buzzes.
INT. BT TOWER LIFT - NIGHT
Crowley enters the lift.

GUARD 2
That was quick.

CROWLEY
Left something back in the van.

CUT TO:

INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

CONSOLE Lights flickering. And then they start to GO OUT.

EXT. BT TOWER STREET - NIGHT

Crowley walks out of the lobby. On the pavement is a
BUSINESSMAN on an old-fashioned pre-smartphone phone.

BUSINESSMAN
No, I understand. That’s why we
have to close this now. So. Seventy
grand. Our final offer. What do you
say?

And then he shakes the phone. Tries redialling, and we follow
Crowley, who is taking off his jacket, past people on the
pavement, a WOMAN,

WOMAN
No Arthur, you can pick me up here.
I’m on the corner of... can you

hear me? Hello?
...a TEENAGE BOY...

TEENAGE BOY
Look, I know I kissed her at the
party. But I mean, that doesn’t
mean I wanted to dump you. I’m
really sorry. I’m really hullo?
Hullo?

Over this we can hear a telecom voice saying “We are sorry.
All circuits are busy.”

And Crowley is smiling. What a wonderful day. Checks his
beautiful black watch, and stresses a little. He’s late.
He reaches his car, a beautiful vintage Bentley Sports Car ,
and pulls out onto the road.

INT. CROWLEY'S BENTLEY - NIGHT

He fumbles with the radio, and to the beat of either KILLER
QUEEN by QUEEN, or a seriously rocking cover of Buddy Holly’s
“EVERY DAY”, he starts driving through the London streets at
ridiculous speeds.

And as he drives, we see a Title Card with GOOD OMENS on it,
and hear our NARRATOR:

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Good Omens. Being a Narrative of
Certain Events occurring in the
last eleven years of human history,
in strict accordance, as shall be
shown, with The Nice and Accurate
Prophecies of Agnes Nutter.

CUT TO:

EXT. A GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

A small country churchyard. Possibly ruined. Rather creepy.
We move through it slowly...

It’s misty, and brrr.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

It wasn’t a dark and stormy night.
It should have been, but that’s the
weather for you. But don’t let the
fog, with rain later, fool you.
Just because it’s a mild night
doesn’t mean the forces of evil
weren’t abroad. They’re everywhere.
That’s the whole point.

And by now we’ve reached two very evil-looking gentlemen,
standing in the shadows. One squat and monstrous, LIGUR. One
tall, thin and monstrous, HASTUR. They have something -- a
box-shaped object -- behind them, in the dark shadows.

Hastur has been hand-rolling a tobacco cigarette. He puts it
in his mouth, lights it with a flame from his fingertip. In
the flame’s light, we get a good look at them.

They don’t have horns, they wear vintage suits and shabby
raincoats, but they aren’t human. Weird eyes.
Skin like frogs, or pitted with terrible acne. They are
trying hard to pass for human, but not even the fog is
helping.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Take these two. They’ve been
lurking in the fog for an hour. But
they've been pacing themselves, and
could lurk until dawn.

LIGUR
Gissa drag.

Hastur hands him the cigarette.

HASTUR
Bugger this for a lark. He should
have been here an hour ago.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
His name is Hastur. He is a Duke of
Hell.

LIGUR
You trust him?

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Ligur. Also a Duke of Hell.

HASTUR
Nope.

LIGUR
Be a funny old world if Demons went
around trusting each other. What’s
he calling himself these days?

HASTUR
Crowley.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
Back to Titles and Rocking Music. Crowley, still speeding,
looks in his rear-view mirror. A POLICE CAR, behind him,

turns on its blue light.

CROWLEY
No.

And now the SIREN starts.

CROWLEY (CONT'D)
I do not have time for this.
10.

EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

Two POLICE OFFICERS are thrilled to be doing a high-speed
chase in the fog. No, really they are.

POLICE 1
The nutter’s doing a hundred and
ten. In the fog. You know what this
means?

POLICE 2
We get to do a hundred and fifteen.
Brilliant. What the hell kind of
car is that?

POLICE 1
Vintage Bentley, I think. Come on,
nutter. Pull over.

CUT TO:

INT. CROWLEY'S BENTLEY - NIGHT

The noise of the siren is starting to get to him. Crowley,
irritated, snaps his fingers.

INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

POLICE 2
(into police radio)
In pursuit of a speeding vehicle.
Vintage Bentley. And we're...

The Police Car engine makes a whining sound, and then it
slows down and stops.

POLICE 2 (CONT'D)

We're having mechanical problems.
Over.

EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

The police car, on the side of the road. Fog. The car’s
steaming. They open the bonnet.

We move from police officer to police officer: they look
horrified and confused. And now we look at the engine.

Where the engine ought to be is just GREEN GOO, steaming and
bubbling gently.
11.

EXT. A GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Ligur and Hastur, still lurking. Hastur crushes the dog-end
under his foot. We can see a little more of the object behind
him.

A car's headlights approach in the fog.

HASTUR
Here he comes now, the flash
bastard.

LIGUR

What's that he's drivin'?

HASTUR
It's a car. A horseless carriage.
Didn't they have them last time you
was up here?

LIGUR
They had a man walking in front
with a red flag.

HASTUR
They've come on a bit since then.

A car door SLAMs.

LIGUR
What’s he like?

HASTUR
Crowley? Been up here too long. And
he wears sunglasses, even when he
dunt need to.

We look from Hastur’s TOAD-LIKE eyes to Ligur’s FLY-EYES, and
we suspect why Crowley might want to wear Sunglasses.

Crowley is Sauntering up the path. He stops. They stare at
him.

HASTUR (CONT'D)
All hail Satan.

LIGUR
All hail Satan.

CROWLEY
Er. Hi guys. Sorry I'm late, but,
well, you know how it is on the A40
at Denham, and then I tried to cut
up towards Chorleywood --
12.

Hastur interrupts him.

HASTUR
Now we art all here, we must
recount the Deeds of the Day.

CROWLEY
("we do? Oh, I remember
this.”)
Of course. Deeds. Yeah.

HASTUR
I have tempted a priest. As he
walked down the street and saw the
pretty girls in the sun, I put
Doubt into his mind. He would have
been a saint, but within a decade
we shall have him.

Ligur makes approving guttural throaty noises, as if this is
the best thing he’s ever heard.

CROWLEY
(politely)
Nice one.
LIGUR

I have corrupted a politician. I
let him think a tiny bribe would
not hurt. Within a year we shall
have him.

Hatsur hisses approval. They stare at Crowley. Him next. But
that’s good, because he has the BEST one...

CROWLEY
You'll like this.

We look at their faces and know that they won’t.
CROWLEY (CONT'D)
I brought down every London area
mobile phone network tonight.

There is a baffled silence.

HASTUR
Yes?
13.

CROWLEY
It wasn’t easy. I had to send rats
into the BT Tower, and I had to
pour tea into the network
controller, while the backup system
was offline for maintainance...

HASTUR
And what exactly has that done to
secure souls for our master?

CROWLEY
Oh come on! Fifteen million pissed-
off people? Who take it out on each
other? Who take it out on everyone
else? Ruined days. Ruined nights.
The knock-on effects are

incalculable...
LIGUR

It’s not... craftsmanship.
CROWLEY

Head office don’t seem to mind.
They love me down there. Guys,
times are changing. So, what’s up?

Hastur reaches down and picks up the object at his feet. Some
kind of wicker basket. He hands it to Ligur, who grins
unpleasantly...

HASTUR
This is.

CROWLEY
No.

LIGUR
Yes.

CROWLEY
Already?

HASTUR
Yes.

CROWLEY

And it’s up to me to...?

LIGUR
Yes.
14.

CROWLEY
You know. This sort of... well, it
really isn’t my scene.

LIGUR
Your scene. Your starring role.
Take it.
HASTUR
Like you said. Times are changing.
LIGUR
They're coming to an end, for a
start.
CROWLEY
Why me?
HASTUR

They love you down there. And what
an opportunity. Ligur here would
give his right arm to be you
tonight.

LIGUR
Somebody's right arm, anyway.

Hastur has produced a clipboard.

HASTUR
Sign here.

Crowley writes A. J. Crowley on the clipboard.

LIGUR
No. Your real name.

Crowley uses the tip of his finger, and writes a sigil which
burns where he’s touched it. The entire sheet of paper goes
up like flash paper.

Ligur holds out the large wicker basket. It could be a dog-

basket, but it’s the wrong shape... Crowley looks dejected.
CROWLEY
Now what?
HASTUR

You will receive instructions. Why
so glum? The moment we have been
working for all these centuries is
at hand!
15.

CROWLEY
Centuries.

LIGUR
Our moment of eternal triumph
awaits!

Crowley is forcing a smile. It does not convince anyone.

CROWLEY
Triumph.

HASTUR
And you will be a tool of that
glorious destiny!

CROWLEY
Glorious. Tool. Yeah.

He takes the basket from Ligur

CROWLEY (CONT'D)
Okay. I'll, er, be off then. Shall
I? Get it over with. Not that I
want to get it over with.
Obviously. But you know me. Keen.

Two implacable Demon faces. Crowley backs away down the
path.

CROWLEY (CONT'D)
So I'll be popping along. See you
guys ar- see you. Er. Great. Fine.
Ciao.

In the mist. We hear the Bentley car door slam.

LIGUR
Wossat mean. Ciao?

HASTUR
It's Italian. It means “food”.
INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Aziraphale walks in. The Waitress points to his favourite
table, kept free for him.

The Sushi Chef behind the counter says,
16.

SUSHI CHEF
(in japanese)
Here is a selection of your
favourite rolls, Honoured
Aziraphale-San.

The waitress, who puts them, along with a cup of steaming
tea, on the table, and bows. Aziraphale bows back.

AZIRAPHALE
(In fluent Japanese)
You honour me. Thank you Suzuki-
San.

He sits at his table. Smiles as he eats his first nibble.
Life is good.

INT. CROWLEY'S BENTLEY - NIGHT

Crowley is driving. He looks miserable, stressed and upset.
The mystery basket is on the back seat. He turns on the
radio.

CROWLEY
Oh. Shit....

NEWSREADER (V.O.)
And the FT index finished up 5
points today, after vigorous
trading.

CROWLEY
..-Ohshitohshitohshit. Why me?

NEWSREADER (V.O.)
Because you earned it, Crowley.
Didn't you?

CROWLEY
Leave it to me, Lord.

NEWSREADER (V.O.)
That is what we are doing, Crowley.
But if anything goes wrong, then
those involved will suffer greatly.
Even you, Crowley. Especially you.

Crowley nods. He’s terrified.

NEWSREADER (V.O.)
Here are your instructions.
17.

And Crowley FREEZES for a moment, as information is
downloaded directly into his brain. (Perhaps, from behind the
dark glasses, his eyes could glow for a moment.)

A bad idea to do this while he’s driving, because a LORRY is
heading towards him in the fog.

At the last moment, he gets his brain back, and TWISTS THE
STEERING WHEEL HARD, slamming out of the Lorry’s way, a
maneuver that throws the wicker basket across the back seat.

And now, for the first time, we can see what it is: a wicker
bassinet. And the sleeping NEWBORN BABY inside it opens its
eyes, and it WAILS...

TITLE CARD: Bringing about Armageddon can be dangerous.
TITLE CARD: Please do not attempt this in your own home.
Now we get the rest of the

TITLE CREDITS. And these occur, being dealt out while we are
in

THE NARRATOR’S WORLD.

A darkened space, like a studio or a warehouse belonging to a
rich madman who can afford anything he wants.

We can see a big, beautiful, globe of the world, and a
newspaper on a table. Other things that are on the table
right now include a pack of cards and a little wind-up
dinosaur skeleton.

A hand comes out of the darkness, and starts to rotate the
globe. Our narrator is authoritative and reassuring: the
voice of history, of science, of wisdom.

As he speaks things ANIMATE: We see, first, the BIG BANG, and
SCIENTISTS. The CERN particle accelerator.

NARRATOR

Current theories on the creation of
the Universe state that it came
into being about twenty billion
years ago. By the same token the
earth itself is generally supposed
to be about four and a half billion
years old.

(beat)
These dates are incorrect.

Now we see ancient scholars, working with abacuses, scrolls
and scraps of parchment...
18.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Medieval Jewish scholars put the
date of the Creation at 3760 BC.
Greek Orthodox theologians put
Creation as far back as 5508 BC.
(beat)
Also incorrect.

Now, Ussher and his assistants, with a huge genealogical list
of the line of Adam, and how long everyone lived...

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Archbishop James Ussher claimed
that the Heaven and the Earth were
created in 4004 BC. One of his
aides took the calculation further,
and was able to announce that the
Earth was created on Sunday the
21st of October, 4004 BC, at 9.00
a.m. This too was incorrect. By
almost a quarter of an hour.

We're back in the Narrator’s space. His face is in the
shadows, but he’s talking to us directly.

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
This proves two things: Firstly,
that God moves in extremely
mysterious ways. God does not play
dice with the universe; He plays an
ineffable game of His own devising,
which might be compared to playing
poker in a pitch-dark room, for
infinite stakes, with a Dealer who
won't tell you the rules.

(beat)

Secondly, the Earth's a Libra.

The Narrator leans into the light and picks up the newspaper.
Reads to us:

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
The astrological prediction for
Libra in the 'Your Stars Today'
column of the Tadfield Advertiser.
LIBRA. You may be feeling run down
and always in the same old daily
round. A friend is important to
you. You may be vulnerable to a
stomach upset today, so avoid
salads. Help could come from an
unexpected quarter.
19.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A green Morris Traveller is driving cautiously along the Road
outside the hospital. Inside the Car are Deirdre Young and
her husband, Arthur Young. He is in his forties, she is in
her late thirties and hugely pregnant. This is her first
child. But everything’s very normal...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

This was perfectly correct on every
count except for the bit about the
salads.

DEIRDRE
Are we there yet? Arthur? Seven
minutes apart.

MR YOUNG
It's definitely this way. It’s just
the roads look all different int he
dark...

DEIRDRE
The nuns said to come in when they
were seven to ten minutes apart.

MR YOUNG
It’s a bit, um. Well. Nuns.
DEIRDRE
Do we have any egg and cress
sandwiches?

Mrs Young reaches for a sandwich, and as she does so, has a
contraction...

A Sirening MOTORCADE zooms past them -- an ambulance,
followed by three black cars.

DEIRDRE (CONT'D)
Arthur. Just follow them.

INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

Suddenly Rapid-cutting, ultra-adrenaline: The Ambulance is
going at speed. In it is HARRIET DOWLING, the movie-star-
beautiful wife of the American Cultural Attache to London.
Very pregnant. Standing near her, and being thrown around are
TWO SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. Holding a video screen, and a
video camera. It’s a pre-skype Video hookup from the old
days.
20.

On the video screen we can see TAD (THADDEUS J) DOWLING,
cultural attache, back in the US, soon to be presidential
hopeful, in a White House meeting. He’s talking to her:

TAD DOWLING
Breathe, honey. Just breathe.

HARRIET
I am breathing, goddammit, Tad. Why
aren’t you here?

TAD DOWLING
Honey. I’m with you. I’m just also
here with the President.

PRESIDENT BUSH
Hey Harriet. Sorry we had to borrow
your husband.

TAD DOWLING
Hon, I’d better get back to the
strategy conference.

HARRIET
You are meant to be with me, you
useless sonofabitch (Contraction).

TAD DOWLING
Honey, you're going to the best
place we could find at short
notice. The, uh...

SECRET SERVICE #1
St Beryl’s Convent Birthing
Hospital, sir.

TAD DOWLING
St Beryl’s. Right. Honey, you just
keep on having the baby. I’1l be
right here with you. Birth is the
single most joyous co-experience
that two human beings can share,
and I’m not going to miss a second
of it.

PRESIDENT BUSH
Tad. If we can return to the matter
in hand?

TAD DOWLING
I’1ll get back to you honey.

And the screen goes blank. Mrs Dowling bites back some really
impressive swearing.
21.

INT. ST BERYL’S CONVENT - NIGHT

An old convent, part of which has been converted into a small
birthing hospital. We are looking at a dozen NUNS. The Mother
Superior is facing them. The SATANIC nature of the place is
given away by the upside-down Cross on the wall beside the
Mother Superior.

MOTHER SUPERIOR
The child of the American Cultural
Attache. Everything is ready.
Tonight, it begins.

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
Excuse me Mother Superior but I was
wondering where the other baby was
going to come from, not the
American baby, I mean that’s
obvious, that’s just the birds and
the bees, but the, you know --

MOTHER SUPERIOR
Mr Crowley is on his way with our
dark master to be, Sister Mary
Loquacious. Now. We are Nuns of the
Chattering Order of Saint Beryl.
And tonight is what our order was
created for.

We can hear the ambulance Siren drawing up outside.

MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT’D)
Places!

And the Nuns begin to move, and as they do, they begin to
chat to each other, each one saying whatever’s on her mind.
Mother Superior reaches out and tips the upside down cross
right-way up. And she SMILES.

EXT. ST BERYL’S CONVENT - NIGHT

Behind the Ambulance and the Motorcade of Black Cars, we see
a Green Morris Traveller.

DEIRDRE
Right.
22.

INT. ST BERYL’S CONVENT RECEPTION - NIGHT

We watch as two things are happening at the same time.
Harriet Dowling is wheeled in, followed by a secret service
man with a video camera, OTHER SECRET SERVICE MEN saying
things like “Clear!” into their earpieces, and all is
commotion...

Meanwhile Mr and Mrs Young walk up to the front desk. He’s
carrying a little suitcase.

DEIRDRE
Excuse me. Deirdre Young. I phoned.
Contractions now five minutes
apart.

SISTER TERESA GARRULOUS
Welcome to St Beryl’s. We’re all
ready for you. Room Three.

Deirdre turns to Mr Young, takes the Suitcase.

DEIRDRE
Obviously Arthur will be with me,
while I’m in labour...

SISTER TERESA GARRULOUS
I don’t think so. We believe
fathers just... complicate the
process for everybody.

DEIRDRE
But--

Mr Young looks relieved.
MR YOUNG
Not going to argue with Nuns.
Nurses. Know what they’re doing,
Deirdre. I'll be. Um.
He produces his pipe, from his pocket.
Deirdre glares at him as she is swept off in a storm of

nuns...

CUT TO:
23.

EXT. ST BERYL’S CONVENT - NIGHT

Mr Young walks out into the driveway to smoke his pipe. He
tamps down some tobacco -- clearly a man for whom the rituals
of smoking are more important than actually smoking itself.
He starts looking for his lighter...

NARRATOR (V.O.)
It may help to understand human
affairs if you notice that most of
the great triumphs and tragedies of
history are caused, not by people
being fundamentally good or
fundamentally bad, but by people
being fundamentally people.

And a Vintage Bentley pulls up. Crowley gets out, grabs the
carry-cot, and heads towards us.

CROWLEY
Has it started yet?

MR YOUNG
They made me go out.

CROWLEY
Any idea how long we've got?

MR YOUNG
I think we were, er, getting on
with it, Doctor.

CROWLEY
Got it. What room is she in?

MR YOUNG
We're in Room Three.

INT. ST BERYL’S CONVENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

We're in the Corridor. Looking at Sister Mary, from the POV
of the baby in the carrycot.

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
Is that him?

CROWLEY
Yup.

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
Only I'd expected funny eyes. Or
teensy-weensy little hoofikins. Or
a widdle tail.
24.

She's taken the baby out of the carrier and is turning it
over...

CROWLEY
It's definitely him.

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
Fancy me holding the Antichrist.
And counting his little toesy-
wosies... Do you look like your
daddy? I bet you do. I bet you look
like your daddywaddykins....

CROWLEY
He doesn’t. Take him up to Room
three.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM THREE - NIGHT

Watching Sister Mary outside the room, with a three on it --
from further down the corridor the Secret Service Men glare
at her suspiciously. Mary goes in, with the antichrist baby,
to the room in which Deirdre Young is asleep.

Mrs Young has BABY B in a bassinet sleeping soundly beside
her.

Sister Mary carefully takes the ID tag off the Young’s baby,
and just as carefully attaches it to the Antichrist Baby.

Sister Mary looks at the two babies. They look quite similar,
don’t they?

She puts on the kettle.
A HESITANT KNOCK on the door. Mr Young.

MR YOUNG
Has it happened yet? I’m the
father. The husband. Both.

MARY
Ooh yes. Congratulations. Your lady
wife’s asleep, poor pet.

Mr Young looks down at the babies. Baby B and the Antichrist
baby.

MR YOUNG
Twins? Nobody said anything about
twins.
25.

MARY
Oh, no! This one's yours. The other
one's... someone else's. Just

looking after him. No, this one's
definitely yours, your
ambassadorship. From the top of his
head to the tips of his
hoofywoofies - which he hasn't got.

MR YOUNG
All, er, present and correct, is
he?

MARY

Oh, yes. Normal. Very, very normal.
You don't have much of an accent.
Have you been over here long?

MR YOUNG
About ten years. The job moved, you
see, and I had to move with it.

MARY
It must have been very different
where you were before.

She's making tea.

MR YOUNG

Er...
MARY

Taller buildings, for one thing.
MR YOUNG

There’s the Alliance and Leicester

offices.
(he’s given tea)
Oh, thank you.

MARY
And I expect you go to a lot of HER
garden parties.

MR YOUNG
Well, fetes mainly. Deidre makes
jam for them, you know. And I
sometimes have to help with the
White Elephant.

MARY
I expect they're tribute. I read
where these foreign potentates give
her majesty all sorts of things.
(MORE )
26.

MARY (CONT'D)
Are you sure you want tea? There’s
actual coffee in one of the
vendible machines on the second
floor.

MR YOUNG
Tea’s fine.

MARY
My word. You have gone native,
haven't you...?

INT. DELIVERY ROOM FOUR - NIGHT

Everything in this delivery room is fast-cut, with
adventurous camera moves and POUNDING MUSIC: we see the sweat
on foreheads, sharp lighting. It is a much bigger delivery
room, which is good because it has to fit a lot of people. We
have our SECRET SERVICE MEN, one of them with his video
camera, one of them holding up a small screen, a couple of
MINOR US OFFICIALS, nurse nuns, and Harriet Dowling, in the
process of giving birth to Baby A, loudly and angrily.

SECRET SERVICE #1
The Eagle is Landing. Repeat. The
Eagle is Landing.
Two nuns give each other significant looks. One of them,
Sister Teresa Garrulous, nods and leaves. More POUNDING
MUSIC.

CUT TO:

INT. A CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

An intimate classical concert, somewhere nice, like an art
museum.

A String Quintet (two cellos) is playing Schubert’s String
Quintet.

The melody washes over a beaming and well-fed Aziraphale,
sitting happily in the well-dressed audience, at perfect
peace with the world.

CUT TO:
27.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Pounding music. Sister Teresa Garrulous isn’t actually
running down the corridors, but she is moving as fast as she
can, scanning every open room as she passes...

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM THREE - NIGHT

Sister Mary is presenting Mr Young with a selection of pink
iced biscuits.

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
Now these are what we call “bis-
cuits”, but you’ll be looking at
them and going
(fingerquotes)
“cookies”!

MR YOUNG
No, I definitely call them
biscuits.

BLAM! The door opens, Mrs Young stirs in her bed, and Sister
Teresa enters, to see:

Sleeping Baby B... Mr Young... Sleeping the Antichrist
Baby... Sister Mary... Sleeping Mrs Young...

Her puzzled glance returns to the babies...

Sister Teresa looks furious, but only for a second.

She looks at Sister Mary and WINKS.

Sister Mary points at Baby B and WINKS.

Sister Teresa looks happy, wheels the bassinet with baby B in
it out of the door, and TAKES OFF DOWN THE CORRIDOR WITH
IT...

Sister Mary smiles happily. FREEZE FRAME.

The Narrator walks in front of the frozen frame, holding a
long pointer.

NARRATOR
As methods of human communication
go, the wink is quite versatile.
For example, Sister Teresa’s wink
meant,
28.

Sister Teresa comes through the door, furious:

SISTER TERESA GARRULOUS
Where the hell have you been? We're
ready to make the switch, and
here's you in the wrong room with
the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings,
Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great
Beast that is called Dragon, Prince
of This World, Father of Lies,
Spawn of Satan, and Lord of
Darkness, drinking tea. Do you
realize I've nearly been shot?

NARRATOR
And, as far as she was concerned,
Sister Mary's answering wink meant:

Sister Mary looks up from her tea, and says, sharp, sexy and
out of character (the voice could be done by Sister Teresa):

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
This child is the Adversary,
Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the
Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is
called Dragon, Prince of This
World, Father of Lies, Spawn of
Satan and Lord of Darkness. But I
cannot speak freely now because
there's this outsider here.

NARRATOR
Sister Mary, on the other hand, had
thought that the orderly's wink was
more on the lines of:

Sister Teresa is now voiced by Sister Mary.

SISTER TERESA GARRULOUS
Well done, that Sister Mary -
switched over the babies all by
herself. Now indicate to me the
superfluous child and I shall
remove it and let you get on with
your tea with his Royal Excellency
the American Culture.

NARRATOR
And therefore her own wink had
meant:
29.

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
There you go, dearie; that one’s
Baby B, now take him away and leave
me to chat to his Excellency. He’s
telling me all about the Queen and
her elephants.

Back to reality:

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS (CONT’D)
Have you picked a name for him yet?

INT. DELIVERY ROOM FOUR - NIGHT
Sister Teresa hands Baby B to Mrs Dowling:

SISTER TERESA GARRULOUS
Here’s your little man back. All
cleaned up and weighed.

The Secret Service men edge forward nervously. One is still
filming: Mrs Dowling shows the baby to his camera.

MRS DOWLING
Look, honey. Our son.

THADDEUS DOWLING
He’s beautiful, hon. What a little
tyke, huh? Seeing him makes me
understand what’s important in
life. It’s not work. I’m going to
teach him to play baseball, and on
Sundays we'll go fishing and, sorry
hon, that’s someone on the other
line.

The awkwardness of the moment is increased as the Mother
Superior, whom we had not seen enter the room, says,
ominously:

MOTHER SUPERIOR
You must name the child.

HARRIET
Well, we were going to name him
Thaddeus, after his pop. And his
pop’s pop...

MOTHER SUPERIOR
Damien’s an excellent name.

HARRIET
Damien Dowling? Too alliterative.
30.

MOTHER SUPERIOR
Warlock, then. It’s an old English
name. A good name.

Harriet looks down at little Warlock.

HARRIET
Hello, Warlock.

INT. ROOM THREE - NIGHT

Deirdre Young is still asleep, as is the Antichrist Baby.
Sister Mary is getting into the naming.

MR YOUNG
Damien? No, I had fancied something
more, well, traditional. We've
always gone in for good simple
names in our family.

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
Cain. Very modern sound, Cain,
really.

MR YOUNG
Hmm.

SISTER MARY LOQUACIOUS
Or there's always .. . well,
there's always Adam.

MR YOUNG
Adam? Hm. Adam...

And at that moment, the baby wakes, and opens its eyes, and

starts to cry... and the baby, waking, wakes Deirdre Young,
DEIRDRE
Oh. Give him here, George. Come on
little one...

She reaches for the crying baby and prepares to breastfeed.
MR YOUNG
You know, Deirdre, I think he looks
like an Adam.

INT. CROWLEY'S BENTLEY - NIGHT

Crowley has a hands free calling system: He’s driving and
says,
31.

CROWLEY
Call Aziraphale.

CARPHONE SYSTEM
Calling Aziraphale.

PHONE SYSTEM
We are sorry. All circuits are
busy. We are sorry. All circuits
are...

INT. THE BOOKSHOP - NIGHT

Aziraphale enters, humming Schubert. Hangs up his coat.

The phone on the desk rings... Aziraphale glares at it. He
wants to let it ring. Then he picks it up.
AZIRAPHALE
I'm afraid we're quite definitely

closed.

INT. VILLAGE PHONE BOX - NIGHT

Crowley is standing in the last village phonebox in England
to have a working payphone in it.

CROWLEY
It’s me. We have to talk. It’s the
Big One.

AZIRAPHALE

Crowley. “The Big One”. Really?
Isn’t that a little melodramatic,
even for you?

CROWLEY
Don’t be like that, Aziraphale.
I'll explain when I see you. Usual
place. Usual time.

AZIRAPHALE
What’s the usual time?

CROWLEY
Whenever I get up.

AZIRAPHALE
Ten thirty?

CROWLEY
One-ish.
32.

AZIRAPHALE
When you say “The Big One..” you DO
mean...?

CROWLEY

Armageddon. Yeah.

He breaks the connection.

INT. AZIRAPHALE’S BOOK SHOP - NIGHT
Aziraphale looks like someone’s punched him in the stomach...

AZIRAPHALE
Oh dear.

CUT TO:

EXT. AFRICAN ROAD - DAY

A dusty red-painted truck rumbles along a dusty road that’s
little more than a track. African music, African animals. A
beautiful establishing shot.

Title card: I

EXT. AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY

A quiet, perfect village. Children run, laughing through the
streets. A woman sits beside her wares in the market. And
there’s a gunshot...

-..no. It’s a truck, backfiring. We see it limping through
the main road, and then it makes some noises trucks should
not make, and STOPS completely.

The DRIVER gets out and lifts the trunk: thick smoke comes
out. An African PASSER-BY walks over.

PASSER-BY
That does not look good.

The driver looks up, and we discover that she is a white
woman in her 20s with the most amazing flame-red hair. She
has an American accent. She’s called SCARLETT. She is WAR.

SCARLETT
Nope. It’s not. Is there a bar
around here? Somewhere I can make a
phone call?
33.

PASSER-BY
Over there. But you can’t just
leave your truck here.

Without a look back, she walks over to the bar...

INT. AFRICAN BAR — DAY

Scarlett opens a bottle of beer by casually slamming it and
her hand against the counter, and drains it. The Bartender is
a bored African woman in her mid 30s.

SCARLETT
I got a truck. The Engine’s shot.
Anyone around here I can talk to?

BARTENDER
Only Nathan. But he’s gone back to
Kaunda to his father-in-law’s farm.

SCARLETT
When’s he coming back?

BARTENDER
A week. Perhaps two weeks.

EXT. AFRICAN ROAD
The Passer-by walks around the truck. Then he peeks inside...

There are a lot of boxes in there. And the boxes are all
stencilled with WARNINGS. High explosive. Ammunition. Guns.
Rocket launchers...

INT. AFRICAN BAR - DAY
A elderly payphone in the corner. Scarlett is talking.

SCARLETT
Yeah, I know you paid for the
shipment. You'll just have to wait
another two weeks to start your
war.

There are TWO MEN sitting at a corner table, having an easy-
going conversation, drinking and laughing.

SCARLETT (CONT’D)
Don’t be like that. No, you listen
to me. No.

(MORE )
34.

SCARLETT (CONT’D)
You may have bought the equipment,
but it begins when I get there...
Really? REALLY?

She puts down the phone, sits down at the table with the men.

SCARLETT (CONT’D)
Hey. When was the last war in these
parts?

The two men look at each other.

BAR CUSTOMER 1
I don’t think we’ve ever had one.

BAR CUSTOMER 2
We don’t go in for things like that
here.

BAR CUSTOMER 1
No! 1952. In the town square...

BAR CUSTOMER 2

That was not a war. And they both
felt a bit silly when they woke

up...

Scarlett gets up and walks out of the bar...

EXT. AFRICAN ROAD - DAY
She looks out at the lazy African paradise.

SCARLETT
Oh, what the hell. I needed a
holiday anyway.

TIME SHIFT...

EXT. AFRICAN ROAD - EVENING

It’s 24 hours later. An explosion rocks the street. A GROUP
OF MEN in improvised uniforms come charging down the street.
A Rattling of sub-machine gun fire takes them out. They fall.
A WOUNDED BOY behind them lobs a grenade...

We follow the grenade behind improvised sandbags. The PEOPLE
BACK THERE see the grenade, and look horrified, as it blows

up...

We look at the Corpses on the street.
35.

And then we see the Empty Truck.

Five Women, one of them the Bartender, are up on the truck.
They have a rocket launcher.

BARTENDER
If the Rebels want War, we will
give them war, my sisters...

EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

A busy African airport. Scarlett, not a hair out of place, is
talking to a an African businessman in the lounge.

BUSINESSMAN
..+-which is why microeconomics is
much more interesting than people
believe. And what about you, Miss?

SCARLETT
You know, I think maybe it’s time
for a new profession... I think I’d

like to be a journalist.

BUSINESSMAN
An agony auntie?

SCARLETT
A war correspondent.

EXT. ST JAMES’S PARK DUCKPOND - MORNING

It’s morning in St James’ Park. It feels like a spy movie.
Our narrator is sitting on the park bench. He is eating a
sandwich.

NARRATOR
They say the ducks in St James’s
park are so used to being fed by
secret agents, that they’ve
developed Pavlovian reactions to
them.

We pull back from him. There are people around the pond, all
pretending that they are not secret agents having clandestine
meetings. We can see a Russian and an American having a
meeting, a British agent and a Chinese, a French and a
Brazilian. In each case, they are pretending to feed the
ducks.
36.

RUSSIAN AGENT
(tossing black bread)
Rudnitsky’s gone triple.

BRITISH AGENT
(cucumber sandwich)
If the treaty is signed, it will
have global repercussions...

FRENCH AGENT
(baguette)
We will match their offer...

NARRATOR
The Russian cultural attache’s
black bread is particularly sought
after by the more discerning duck.
Crowley and Aziraphale have been
meeting here for several hundred
years.

Aziraphale is tossing his breadcrust to a drake. The drake
pecks at it, then squawks, and DIES.

Crowley has come up behind Aziraphale. They talk without
looking at each other, like the other spies do.

AZIRAPHALE
Really, my dear. Was that
necessary?

CROWLEY

Sorry.
The drake RETURNS TO LIFE, quacks and paddles off.

AZIRAPHALE
We knew something was going on, of
course. I’ve made enquiries. An
American diplomat. Really? As if
Armagedden were a cinematographic
show you wished to sell in as many
countries as possible.

CROWLEY
The Earth and all the Kingdoms
thereof.
Aziraphale looks at Crowley for the first time.

AZIRAPHALE
We will win, of course.
37.

CROWLEY
You really believe that?

AZIRAPHALE
Obviously. Heaven finally triumphs
over hell. It’s all going to be
rather lovely.

Crowley starts walking through the park. Aziraphale
reluctantly follows him.

CROWLEY
Out of interest, how many first
class composers do your lot have in
Heaven? Because Mozart’s one of
ours. Beethoven. Schubert. All the

Bachs...

AZIRAPHALE
They have already written their
music...

CROWLEY

And you'll never hear it again. No
more Albert Hall. No more
Glyndebourne. No more proms. No
Compact Disks. Just celestial
harmonies.

AZIRAPHALE
Oh dear.

CROWLEY
And that’s just the start of what
you'll lose if you win. No more
fascinating little restaurants
where they know you. No gravlax
with dill sauce. No more old
bookshops. No more Regency Silver
Snuffboxes.

AZIRAPHALE
But after we win, life will be
better for everybody.

CROWLEY
You'll be about as happy with a
harp as I'll be with a pitchfork.

AZIRAPHALE
We don’t play harps.
38.

CROWLEY
And we don’t use pitchforks. You
know what I mean.

AZIRAPHALE
But it has to happen. The Four
Horsemen will ride out. The Seas
will turn to blood...

CROWLEY
The seas are fine just as they are.
It’s where your sushi comes from.

They've reached Crowley’s Bentley. He’s parked it on the
Mall, somewhere you can’t park. It already has a wheelclamp
on it, and a Traffic Warden is walking around it, writing
things down in his notebook, because this is the past, when
they had notebooks.

CROWLEY (CONT'D)
We've got about a decade. Then it’s
all over. You have to help me.

AZIRAPHALE
No.

CROWLEY
I’m serious. It’s the end of the
world we're talking about. Not some
little temptation I've asked you to
cover for me while you’re in
Edinburgh for the festival. You
can’t just say no.

AZIRAPHALE
No.

CROWLEY
We can do something. I’ve got an
idea.

AZIRAPHALE

I. Am. Not. Interested.

A breath. Crowley is about to fall apart. But he pulls
himself together.

CROWLEY
Fair enough. Let’s have lunch. I
still owe you one from...

Aziraphale glares at him. Then softens...
39.

AZIRAPHALE
Paris. 1793.

CROWLEY
Oh, yes. The Reign of Terror. Was
that one of yours or one of ours?

They get in to the car... The WHEELCLAMPS VANISH.

AZIRAPHALE
Can't recall. Quite a nice
restaurant though.

The Traffic Warden, who is looking triumphant, is startled
when his notebook bursts into flames as the Bentley drives
away.

CROWLEY
I didn’t mean to do that.

AZIRAPHALE
That was me. I thought your people
invented them.

CROWLEY
Really? I thought they were yours.

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

We pan across a restaurant. It’s a fancy restaurant. Dry ice
and liquid nitrogen. Molecular Gastronomy. It’s very fancy...

Aziraphale and Crowley are looking around.

CROWLEY
Ah. Sorry about this. Under new
management. Still the most
expensive restaurant in London.
Just now it’s molecular gastronomy.
Apparently they use, er, molecules.

AZIRAPHALE
Not really my kind of thing.

CROWLEY
What is your kind of thing?

AZIRAPHALE
Well, they always do a lovely high
tea at the Ritz.

Crowley sighs and turns around. They leave....
40.

But we remain in the restaurant. We pan across until we meet
the owner of the restaurant...

RAVEN SABLE, who is American, dressed in black, and has the
kind of beard popularised by the late Roger Delgado, or
failing that, Max Maven. He looks sinister without trying. He
is FAMINE.

Title Card: II

Sable looks on with approval as a WAITER brings his dining
partner, FRANNIE, his accountant and Financial Manager, a
nearly empty but beautiful plate...

WAITER
Your main course, madam. Chicken
froth, on a reduction of broccoli
gel, with a mushroom foam. And the
chef recommends this, first...

He hands her a balloon...

FRANNIE
What is it? It looks like a
balloon.

WAITER

A balloon filled with lavender-
scented air. Inhale it, then eat
your dinner.

FRANNIE

I need another glass of wine.
WAITER

Of course.
SABLE

Bon appetite, Frannie. So. You saw
the latest royalty statement?

Frannie is hungry. The molecular gastronomy is lost on her...

FRANNIE
12 Million copies, Dr Sable.

SABLE
C’mon. Eat hearty. Molecular
gastronomy. Amazing, huh?

FRANNIE
It’s a lot of copies...
SABLE
I was thinking about this place.
All the money these folks pay to
stay hungry. Yeah. I think it’s
time to expand.

FRANNIE
A new line of diet books?

SABLE
Much more than that. It’s time to
go corporate. A chain of fast food
outlets. Factories. The whole
schmear.

They are interrupted by SHERRYL, a FASHION MODEL.

41.

Horrendously underweight. Beautiful but dear god how can a

human being be that thin...?

SHERRYL
Uh. Dr Sable. I hope you don’t mind
me interrupting you. But your book.
It changed my life... Sherryl. Two
Rs. And a Y.

She puts the book down on the table. Sable’s photo
cover -- “THE D-PLAN DIET.” And the subtitle “SLIM
BEAUTIFUL -- TERMINALLY!”

He signs, saying:
SABLE

Why indeed? There. A quote from the
book of the revelation of St John.

SHERRYL
You don’t know how much this means
to me.
She backs away.
FRANNIE
That girl looks like she’s starving
to death.
SABLE

She is. She’s dying of hunger right
now. So. Corporate...

Frannie has an ultrathin, ultralight black laptop.

She's

FRANNIE
Already on it. We can buy into
Holdings (Holdings) Incorporated
for the initial Lichtenstein
toehold. We use the Cayman Islands

as a... Dr Sable? Are you
listening?

SABLE
Sorry -- It just occurred to me.

I’ve never seen a room full of rich
people so hungry...

EXT. AZIRAPHALE’S BOOK SHOP - DAY

Crowley and Aziraphale are heading down the pavement to the
Book shop.

AZIRAPHALE
I have several very nice little
Chateuneuf De Papes in the back. I
picked up a dozen cases of them in
1921, and I still have a couple of
bottles left, for special
occasions.

CROWLEY
Not very big on wine in Heaven, are
they? Not going to get any more
nice little Chateuneuf De Papes in
Heaven. Or Single malt scotch. Or
little cocktails with umbrellas.

AZIRAPHALE
I told you, Crowley. I’m not
helping you. I’m not interested.
This is purely social. I’m an
angel. You’re a demon. We’re
hereditary enemies. Get thee behind
me, foul fiend!

He unlocks the door to the bookshop.
AZIRAPHALE (CONT'D)
After you.
EXT. OIL TANKER - DAY
WHITE is in his twenties. He’s beautiful, in a dirty sort of
way. Everything about him, overalls, face, hair, is slightly

grimy... He’s mopping a deck of an oil tanker... FREEZE on
his face.
43.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

He’s called White, or Albus, or
Chalky, or Snowy. He’s had lots of
interesting jobs in lots of
interesting places... He’s helped
design the petrol engine, plastics
and the ring-pull can... He can
turn his hand to anything, Mr
White.

Title Card: III

White is walking through the Tanker’s decks. He passes the
Captain’s Cabin:

SHOT, CAPTAIN in bed, a hand releases an empty bottle to the
floor of the cabin. It rolls away and back.

White passes a toilet. The NOISES of someone having a
miserable time being sick emerge as he passes.

White walks through the galley, where the SECOND MATE is
passing the time by tossing peanuts into the air and catching
them in his mouth. Or failing to catch them...

NARRATOR (V.O.)

The captain is drunk in his cabin.
The first mate is sick with a tummy
bug. The second mate is in the
galley. And that doesn’t matter,
because the tanker is almost
entirely automated.

White reaches a door marked RESTRICTED ACCESS. The door
swings open as he gets there.

NARRATOR
There’s almost nothing left for a
person can do.

There’s a small Video Cam Unit in a corner, and a black and
white monitor showing what’s going on inside. White ISN'T on
it.

INT. RESTRICTED AREA - DAY

WHITE walks to the Emergency Cargo Release Switch. It says
“Insert KEY to Initialise EMERGENCY CARGO RELEASE”. He licks
a finger, thoughtfully, and twirls it in the air...

As if in sympathy, lock turns, with no key in it.
44,

White flicks the Cargo release switch into the RELEASE
position.

WHITE
(gently. Wistfully.)
Oops.

BIRDSEYE VIEW: THE TANKER - DAY

We see the tanker below us, and, all around it a huge black
oil spill spreading out across the blue of the sea.

NARRATOR
Afterwards, there was a huge amount
of discussion as to whose fault it
was. Neither the captain, the first
or the second mate ever worked
again...

EXT. TANKER DECK - DAY

The CAPTAIN, FIRST MATE and SECOND MATE are led off, dazed,
in handcuffs, by POLICE...

A tiny ship, a little steamer, as different as can possibly
be from the gleaming huge tanker, IS PASSING IN THE
BACKGROUND. We zoom in on it....

NARRATOR
But no-one gave any thought to Able
Seaman White...

EXT. SMALL SHIP - DAY
And there is White, eating crisps on the deck of the steamer.
He tosses the empty crisp packet overboard. Behind him, we
pan up to see, are rusting barrels each stencilled with
WEEDKILLER -- TOXIC -- EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and Death’s
heads...
NARRATOR
Nobody ever does.

EXT. AZIRAPHALE’S BOOK SHOP - NIGHT

Establishing shot of the outside of the shop. Soho...
45.

INT. AZIRAPHALE’S BOOK SHOP

We move through the bookshop, listening to their
conversation, until we reach the back room. There are a LOT
of bottles of wines and spirits on the various surfaces,
along with the teetering piles of books, the regency snuff
box display. Crowley is Drunker than Aziraphale, but they are
both drunk.

AZIRAPHALE
So what. Exactly. Is. Your. Point?

CROWLEY
My point is. My point is. The point
I’m trying to make is... the
dolphins. That’s my point.

AZIRAPHALE
Kind of fish.

CROWLEY
Nononono, ‘S mammal. Your actual
mammal. Difference is...

Neither of them are very clear on the differences.

AZIRAPHALE
Mate out of water?

CROWLEY
Don’t think so. Something about
their young. Not the point. The
point is. Their brains.

He pours himself a huge glass of wine. It takes a lot to get
supernatural beings drunk.

AZIRAPHALE
What about their brains?

CROWLEY
Big brains. That’s my point. Size
of. Size of. Size of damn big
brains. Not to mention whales.
Brain city, whales, take it from
me.

AZIRAPHALE
Kraken. Great big bugger. Supposed
to rise to the surface right at the
end, when the sea boils.
46.

CROWLEY
That's my point, whole sea
bubbling, dolphins, whales,
everybody turning into bouillab,
bouillab, fish soup. Not their
fault. Same with gorillas. Whoops,
they say, sky gone all red, stars
crashing to ground, what they
putting in the bananas these days?

AZIRAPHALE
All creatures great and small. Poor
little, big...

CROWLEY

And you know what makes it worse.
When it’s all gone. You are going
to have to deal with... ETERNITY!

Crowley makes a huge gesture and sends a glass and contents
flying. It smashes, loudly. Aziraphale gestures, and it
reforms, slightly drunkenly.

AZIRAPHALE
Eternity?

Crowley has found Aziraphale’s collection of Theatre
programmes.

CROWLEY

It won't be so bad at first. No
Stephen Sondheim first nights in
Eternity. But I’ve been assured He
has a fondness for Andrew Lloyd
Webber musicals. And He really
loves the Sound of Music. Fancy
spending Eternity watching that?
You could literally climb every
mountain over and over and over...

Crowley walks around the back room...

AZIRAPHALE
I don't like it any more than you,
but I told you. I can't disod - not
do what I'm told. 'M a'nangel. I...
(pause)
I can't cope with this while 'm
drunk. I'm going to sober up.

CROWLEY
Me too.
47.

He closes his eyes, and jerks: We watch the all bottles
around the room refill with alcohol. Crowley and Aziraphale
look like people who have just become un-drunk and don’t like
it.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Mr Young drives the car up to the Main Door. Deirdre comes
out, with the baby. A bunch of chattering nuns wave goodbye,
still chattering. Over this we hear Crowley and Aziraphale
talking.

INT. AZIRAPHALE’S BOOK SHOP - NIGHT

Crowley is pacing, impatiently. Putting corks back into wine
bottles, perhaps. Aziraphale is agitated. They are both
sober. And Aziraphale is coming over to the dark side.

AZIRAPHALE
Look! It’s not that I disagree with
you. But I’m an angel. I’m not
allowed to disobey.

CROWLEY
You think I am?

AZIRAPHALE
You’re a demon. You love to
disobey.

CROWLEY

My people are only into
disobedience in general terms. Not
when it applies to them.

AZIRAPHALE
Even if I wanted to help, I
couldn’t! I can't interfere with
divine plans.

Crowley gets an idea...

CROWLEY
What about diabolical ones? My lot
have put the baby in play, after
all. You can interfere with that!

AZIRAPHALE
But... It's still part of the
overall divine plan. It’s all part
of the divine plan.
48.

CROWLEY
Then you can't be certain that
thwarting me isn't part of the
divine plan too. I mean, you're
supposed to thwart the wiles of the
Evil One at every turn, aren't you?

AZIRAPHALE
Well...

CROWLEY
You see a wile, you thwart. Am I
right?

AZIRAPHALE

Broadly. Actually I encourage
humans to do the actual --

CROWLEY
The Antichrist is here. But birth
is just the start. It's the
upbringing that's important. It's
the Influences. And the evil
influences -- that’s all me!

AZIRAPHALE
If you put it that way, Heaven
couldn't actually mind me thwarting

you...

CROWLEY
It'd be a real feather in your
wing.

Aziraphale looks at him, doubtfully. Then he reaches out a
hand, and Crowley and Aziraphale shake hands on it.

CROWLEY (CONT'D)

We'll be godfathers, sort of. Over-
seeing his upbringing. He won’t be
evil. He'll be normal.

AZIRAPHALE
You know, I'd never have thought of
that. Godfathers. Well, I'll be
damned.

CROWLEY
It’s not that bad. Once you get
used to it.

We hear a crack of thunder...
49.

EXT. A HILLSIDE ABOVE THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A storm has begun. There’s a motorcade, ready to take the
Dowling baby away. Mrs Dowling comes out of the Door, with
the baby.

We pull back: From the top of a nearby hill, Hastur steps
from the shadows. The Mother Superior and Sister Grace
Voluble runs up the hill.

MOTHER SUPERIOR
Our Mission is done, Lord Hastur.
The baby is in place.

HASTUR
No need for the convent any longer,
then. Or for the Order.

MOTHER SUPERIOR
I'm afraid I --

HASTUR
Your order is dissolved.

MOTHER SUPERIOR
We're what?

SISTER GRACE VOLUBLE
Now hang on a moment. We did
everything that was asked of us.
What about our rewards?

HASTUR
You irritate me. You talk too much.

SISTER GRACE VOLUBLE
We are a chattering order. We say
exactly what is on our mind, and
right now, what’s on my mind is
that you can’t treat us like --

Hastur reaches out and puts his hand over Sister Grace’s
mouth, and squeezes. She dies. Hastur looks at the Mother
Superior.

HASTUR
Do you want to tell them the order
is dissolved? Or do you want them
all to perish in the fire.

MOTHER SUPERIOR
(shaken)
Fire?
50.

Hastur gestures. Lightning strikes the roof of the Hospital.
The Mother Superior looks at him, and then runs back down the
hill. Hastur begins to laugh, and it’s absorbed by the
thunder.

The lights of the fire brigade are coming...

DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE:
We hold on the fallen body of the late Sister Grace Voluble.

And then we move from her to the fallen bodies in the African
Village Square.

From there to Sherryl the supermodel from the restaurant, in
bed, dead.

From there to dead fish, floating in an oil spill...

And from there back to the Weedkiller boat, and we close in
on the death’s head on the POISON signs. The sign of the
grinning skull.

Title: IV
Over all this:

NARRATOR
And there’s a Fourth. He’s
everywhere, and what he does is
what he is. He isn’t waiting. He’s
working. Although in a manner of
speaking, he’s waiting for us all.

CUT TO:

EXT. WARLOCK’S RESIDENCE - DAY

It's fancy, and there are secret service men outside. We see
a Mary Poppins style NANNY walking towards the house, with
her back to us.

The doorbell is pressed. The door is opened. And the Nanny,
wearing dark glasses, reminds us of Crowley. She’s sexy and
domineering.

NANNY
I understand you need a nanny.
51.

EXT. WARLOCK’S BACK DOOR - DAY

The back door is opened. A saintly friar-like GARDENER, big
victorian gaffer sideburns, angelic, with a spade, who
perhaps reminds us a little of Aziraphale, possibly chewing a
grass-blade, raises his hat and says,

GARDENER
They do say as you moight be
lookin’ for a gardener.

EXT. WARLOCK’S RESIDENCE GARDEN - DAY

TITLE CARD: SIX YEARS AGO

A small boy in a garden. Brother Francis, the gardener, is
feeding the birds...

YOUNG WARLOCK, aged about 5, wanders over:

YOUNG WARLOCK
Hello Brother Francis.

GARDENER
Hullo, Young Warlock. My, you're
growing fast. You must be all of...

YOUNG WARLOCK
Five. I'm five. What’s that?

GARDENER
Brother Sparrow. And here’s Brother
Snail... Sister Slug. Remember,
Warlock, as you grow, to have love
and reverence for all living
things.

YOUNG WARLOCK
Nanny says Living things are only
fit to be ground under my heels,
Brother Francis.

GARDENER
Don’t listen to her. Listen to me.
INT. WARLOCK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Nanny has wound up the SPOOKY MUSIC BOX and the thing that
casts SCARY SHADOWS ON THE WALL. Young Warlock is in bed.
52.

YOUNG WARLOCK
Will you sing me a lullaby, Nanny?

NANNY
Of course, dear.
(sings)
Go to sleep and dream of pain/ Doom
and darkness, blood and brains/
Sleep so sweet, my darling boy/ You
will rule, when Earth's destroyed.

YOUNG WARLOCK
Francis says that I must be kind
and nice to everybody. And hug
them. Even Brother slug. And not
destroy the earth.

NANNY
Don’t listen to him. Listen to me.
EXT. LONDON BUS - DAY

The top deck of a bus. Aziraphale is reading a paper. Crowley
sits down next to him.

CROWLEY
He’s too normal.

AZIRAPHALE
Not at all. It’s working. The
Heavenly influences are balancing
out the hellish. A no score draw.

CROWLEY
I hope you’re right. Six years to
go.
INT. LIFTS - DAY
Cut between Crowley and Aziraphale entering lifts, and
pushing buttons for the top floor and the bottom.

INT. OFFICE HELL - DAY

Crowley gets out of the lift. He saunters over to reception.
Muzak in background.

CROWLEY
Er. Crowley. Annual report.
53.

RECEPTIONIST
Room Five.

Crowley walks down a dull corridor, past identical doors.
Door Four opens, and Hastur comes out, along with a blast of
fire and screams from inside. He’s dusting himself off.

CROWLEY
Hastur.

HASTUR
Crowley.

They both go through door 5.

INT. DOOR 5 - NO DAYLIGHT

It’s an office. It’s shadowy, which is good, as we do not
want to see the entities to whom Crowley is reporting in too
much detail.

DAGON
Tell uss about the boy Warlock.

CROWLEY
He’s a remarkable child.

HASTUR
Is he evil?

CROWLEY
Fantastically evil.

LIGUR
Killed anyone yet?

CROWLEY
Not yet. But there’s more to evil
than just killing people.

Vague noises of agreement from hellish entities: Crowley has
a point.

LIGUR
Yeah. But it’s fun.

INT. HEAVENLY OFFICE - DAY

We're at the top of a skyscraper, looking out over London.
Aziraphale’s meeting is very similar. Nicer decor. The
incredibly well-dressed, nice men and women he’s talking to
have faces that seem slightly burned out by light.
54.

AZIRAPHALE
And I feel that, on a deep level,
the child is being influenced
towards the light. By me.

ANGEL #1
That sounds very commendable.
Excellent work, Aziraphale. As
usual.

ANGEL #2
Yes. But Aziraphale. We will be
most understanding should you fail.
After all, wars are to be won.

ANGEL #1
Not avoided.

ANGEL #2
Still. As he likes to say. Climb
every mountain.

ANGEL #1
Ford every stream.

And we finish on Aziraphale’s face, as he winces.

TITLE CARD: THE PRESENT DAY.

TITLE CARD: TUESDAY.

INT. BRITISH MUSEUM - DAY

WARLOCK, a couple of days before his 11th birthday, is being
dragged about the British Museum by his mother.

MRS DOWLING
Honey. Look. It’s old. And
educational.

WARLOCK
It’s dumb.

MRS DOWLING
It’s not dumb, sweetie. It’s
thumbscrews.

WARLOCK
Dumbscrews more like. Can we talk
about my birthday party?
55.

Mrs Dowling drags him over to the next exhibit. We pull back

to see that Crowley and Aziraphale were both watching.

CROWLEY
Thumbscrews! What normal kid
doesn’t like torture?

AZIRAPHALE
But it’s good he’s not interested
in torture! Isn’t it?

CROWLEY
I don’t know.

AZIRAPHALE
So. I hear that your people will be
sending him a Hell Hound.

CROWLEY
It’s the start of it all. He has to
name it: Stalks By Night, or Throat-—
Ripper or something. But if we’ve
done our job, properly, he’ll send
it away, unnamed.

AZIRAPHALE
And if he does name it?

CROWLEY
Then you and I have lost. He’1l
have all his powers, and Armageddon
will be just around the corner.

AZIRAPHALE
At his birthday party?

CROWLEY
Yes.

AZIRAPHALE
We should be there. In fact...(He’s
just had an idea) I could.
Entertain.

CROWLEY

No. Please, no.

AZIRAPHALE
(wiggling his fingers)
I'd just need to get back in
practice.

Attempts a French Drop with a coin. Drops it. Fumbles around

to pick it up, irritating tourists.
56.

CROWLEY
Don’t do this. Please. I am
actually begging you, and you have
no idea how demeaning that is.
Please.

EXT. WARLOCK’S PARTY - DAY

We are in a huge tent in Warlock’s back garden. It’s a party!
Birthday balloons. We have a couple of dozen eleven year
olds, all very well dressed. Warlock is wearing an 11 Badge,
the kind you get off a birthday card.

We also have some SECRET SERVICE OFFICERS. The same ones we
saw eleven years ago, just a little older.

We have caterers, all wearing white food-serving jackets,
even Crowley, who seems to be in charge of them, and is
waiting by the cake. There are trifles and jellies and such.

Crowley looks down in embarrassment.

The Kids all look bewildered -- horrified -- saddened.
Because, up on a little stage...

It’s AZIRAPHALE! Dressed in the style of a Victorian
conjurer, top hat and tails and all, in clothes he bought a
hundred and fifty years ago and has not work for fifty, and
has never dry cleaned, proud as punch.

THE AMAZING MISTER FELL AND HIS REMARKABLE FEATS OF
PRESTIDIGITATION is painted on a peeling old canvas in front
of him. He has a little collapsible table, a magic wand, and
he’s in heaven. Right now, he’s showing them his hat.

AZIRAPHALE
Now you sees my old top hat? Where
did you get that hat, as you young
uns do say? Well, you also see that
there is nothing inside my
perfectly normal top hat such as
any of you might wear on a trip to
the confectioners. But wait! What
is this? Could it be our furry
friend, Harry the Rabbit?

A rabbit is produced from the hat. The kids are unimpressed.

WARLOCK
Dumb. It was in the table.
57.

GIRL 1
You said there were going to be
cartoons. I got cartoons at my
birthday. An I got an Ipad an I got
an Iphone an I got a smartwatch an
I got a...

GIRL 2
You're rubbish.

BOY 1
Excuse me. Excuse me. She’s right,
you know. You are actually rubbish.

Crowley is looking around for the Black Hound. He looks at
the Clock -- 2 minutes to 3. Checks his watch: almost 3...

AZIRAPHALE
(pressing on)
Do any of you young’uns have such a
thing as a thruppeny bit about your
persons? No? Well, what’s that
behind your ear?

Crowley is counting the seconds now. Five, four, three,
two...

INT. HELL, DOG HANGAR

Hastur and Ligur. They are standing in a huge aircraft-hangar
like building in Hell. A huge portcullis-like gate behind
them. We can’t see the animal in there, but it would appear
to be about thirty feet high and terrifying. It GROWLS.

They are eyeing it nervously. A DISPOSABLE DEMON near them,
eyes it with stark terror.

HASTUR
That’s... that’s a hell hound all
right.

LIGUR
It’s big.

HASTUR

It’ll be what he wants it to be.
You! Get in there. Open the gate!

DISPOSABLE DEMON
Me?

HASTUR
You. Yeah. Watch out for his teeth.
58.

Hastur and Ligur watch, as the demon vanishes off. Hell Hound
growls. The Sound of a winching gate lifting...

Then a SCREAM from the disposable Demon. Hastur and Ligur
wince. Sound of a disposable demon being eaten.

LIGUR
It’s not like you didn’t tell him
to look out for the teeth.

HASTUR
Point. Now. He’s free to find his
master...

They look up, scared, as the shadow of something huge goes
past them...

INT. WARLOCK’S PARTY - DAY
Crowley’s watch says 3 pm. Crowley looks around. Nothing.

BOY 1
This sucks.

AZIRAPHALE
And for my next remarkable
illusion, I will need a pocket
handkerchief. A perfectly normal
one. Does anyone have a pocket
handkerchief?

Blank kids. Some of them have pulled out their phones and are
playing video games.

AZIRAPHALE (CONT'D)
I do. I really will need a
handkerchief. I...

He blinks and performs a miracle. Ping! Turns to a Security
Guard...

AZIRAPHALE (CONT'D)
You, my fine young jack-sauce. If
you look in your pocket, I have no
doubt you will find a handkerchief.

GUARD
M’afraid not, sir.

AZIRAPHALE
No. You do. Just look. Please look.
59.

The guard reaches into his inside pocket, and looks puzzled.
Then pulls out AN ENORMOUS LACE-EDGED HANKIE which goes not
into his pocket, but into his shoulder holster... and which,
as he pulls it out, snags his gun.

The gun ARCS slowly and gracefully and in slow motion through
the air.

It splashes down in a bowl of trifle near Warlock.
The kids applaud. This is more like it!

GIRL 2
Not bad.

Warlock grabs the gun. Covers the room.

WARLOCK
Hands up lowlife scumbuckets! I got
a gun.

A beat. The Guards look around, panicky, and aren’t sure what
to do...

GIRL 1
S'not fair. Why have you got a gun
and we don’t?

WARLOCK
I’m not stopping you.

Girl 1 is next to a Security Guard, and grabs at his gun...
The Guard doesn’t quite know how to deal with this.

Boy 1 throws a lump of cake at Warlock, who whirls around,
and reflexively, squeezes the trigger...

FREEZE IMAGE.

INT. NARRATOR'S WORLD

We are in the Narrator’s World, and the scene is on a big
Screen. The Narrator is standing beside it.

NARRATOR
The .357 Magnum Hollow point
cartridge, coming out of a secret
service Sig Sauer P229 at 1,430
feet per second, is capable of
blowing anyone away, leaving only a
red mist in the air, a messy corpse
and a certain amount of paperwork.

(MORE )
60.
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
It would have taken a miracle to
avoid a massacre.
INT. WARLOCK’S PARTY - DAY

Close up on Aziraphale’s face. He does a Miracle Blink, and --

A STREAM OF WATER comes from the nozzle of Warlock’s gun.
Which is now a water pistol.

Aziraphale looks rather proud of himself.

And then a huge lump of birthday trifle HITS HIM IN THE FACE.
Guards are (puzzled) firing water pistol guns.

Kids are (enthusiastically) firing water pistol guns.

Perfectly timed lumps of jelly and trifle and cake are being
thrown around. IT’S A FOOD FIGHT!

WARLOCK
Best Eleventh Birthday ever!

And through the chaos and the flying food, Crowley walks
perfectly unharmed, untouched, barely paying attention to the
chaos, checking his watch, removing his white caterer’s
jacket, and dropping it onto the ground...

EXT. WARLOCK’S RESIDENCE - DAY

The street outside. Crowley is standing, looking worried.

Aziraphale joins him. He’s reaching into his sleeve.

AZIRAPHALE
It was all a bit of a mess, I’m
afraid.

CROWLEY

Nonsense. You gave them all a party
to remember. Last one they’1ll ever
have, mind...

Aziraphale has removed the dove from his sleeve. He’s
prodding it, but it’s dead.

AZIRAPHALE
It’s late.

CROWLEY
Comes of putting it up your sleeve.
AZIRAPHALE
No. The Hell Hound. It’s late.

Crowley irritably taps the dead dove, which flutters and
flies off. He reaches into the Bentley and turns on the

radio. It’s JUST A MINUTE...

NICHOLAS PARSONS (V.O.)
And you have Just a Minute to tell
us all about Fish Fingers starting
Hello Crowley. Is sssomething
wrong?

CROWLEY
Um. Hi. Who’s this?

NICHOLAS PARSONS
Dagon. Lord of the Files. Master of
Torments.

CROWLEY
Yeah. Just checking in about the
Hell Hound...

NICHOLAS PARSONS
We freed him. He walks to find his
master. Is something wrong,
Crowley?

CROWLEY
Wrong? No.... Nothing’s wrong. What
could be wrong? I can see it now.
What a lovely big helly hell hound.
Hey, great talking to you.

He turns off the radio.

AZIRAPHALE
No dog.

CROWLEY
No dog.

AZIRAPHALE
Wrong boy.

CROWLEY
Wrong boy.

There’s a gunshot.
AZIRAPHALE

(not swearing)
Oh sugar! I must have missed one.

61.
62.

CROWLEY
Armageddon is days away. And we've
lost the Antichrist. Get in.

Aziraphale just stands there, shocked.
AZIRAPHALE
How can you lose the Antichrist?
INT. CROWLEY'S BENTLEY - DAY
They are both shocked.

AZIRAPHALE
You said it was him.

CROWLEY
It was him. I should know. I
delivered the baby. Not delivered-
delivered it. You know. Handed it

over.
AZIRAPHALE
Someone else must be interfering,
then.
CROWLEY

Who? There isn’t anyone else.
There’s good, that’s your lot.
There’s evil. That’s mine. One side
or the other. And between us, we've
lost the antichrist.

AZIRAPHALE
I can’t believe it. Even Heaven was
certain that the Hell Hound would
be showing up today.

CROWLEY
It was sent. And the boy was meant
to have named it. You have to name
the beast: it gives it its purpose
and its function. It’1l be stalks
by night, or throat-ripper or
something.

AZIRAPHALE
Perhaps he won’t name it.

CROWLEY
He’1ll name it. I’m screwed. Do you
know what they can do to you down
there?
63.

AZIRAPHALE
The same sort of thing they can do
to you up there.

CROWLEY
Yeah, but you lot get ineffable
mercy.

AZIRAPHALE

Remember Sodom and Gomorrah? That
was my team.

CROWLEY
Oh, the good times. There was a
little bar you could get a
fermented date palm cocktail...

AZIRAPHALE
I mean, after.
(pause)
So if that appalling child wasn’t
the antichrist, where in blessed
blazes is he? And where’s the Hell
Hound? And what do we do?

EXT. TADFIELD - DAY

Still a beautiful little village in England. We are moving
through it.

The clock on the village steeple is striking Three.

EXT. TADFIELD: THE ROAD TO THE QUARRY - DAY

Look! There’s a sort of an abandoned quarry down there,
through the bushes. It’s a perfect place for kids to play. An
area of natural beauty that adults have forgotten. And
there’s a lane above it.

Birds are singing. A lazy bumble bee buzzes in the flowers at
the side of the lane.

Down in the quarry we can see CHILDREN, four of them, all
about eleven, playing.

They are a gang of Four, called The Them, and we will meet
them next episode.

They look harmless and sweet and VULNERABLE...
64.

And one of them is swinging down a rope, in a repeat of the
Zip-Line incident, only rather more successful: Golden-
haired, glorious, the ultimate 11 year old. It MUST be ADAM.

And now we hear something, as the last of the bell chimes
fades away. Something metallic and disturbing, rumbling and
nightmarish.

A ripping, rumbling noise, and now, LOOK! There’s a beat and
in front of us, on the lane, appears, from Hell --

THE HELL HOUND.

If we can, this should be a REAL big black dog, possibly CGI
enhanced. It’s huge: a terrifying monster of a dog. The Hound
of the Baskervilles would take one look at this brute and
flee, whimpering. The Dog’s eyes are glowing red. It drips
saliva.

It looks at the kids below, hungrily and evilly...

And it opens its mouth and GROWLS terrifyingly, showing huge
and awful teeth as we -

FADE TO BLACK.

OVER END CREDITS, BUDDY HOLLY’S “EVERY DAY”, THIS TIME DONE
BY A BOYS’ CHOIR, IN THE STYLE OF CARMINA BURANA.
