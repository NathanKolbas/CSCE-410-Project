BREAKING BAD

“I.F.T"

Episode #303

3.36
TEASER

MACRO-CLOSE - A CIGAR

A quality Cuban. Torpedo shaped, with a deep brown wrapper.
We're focused on the freshly-cut end of it.

We hear a button CLICK! -- the sound of a butane TORCH
LIGHTER being triggered...

PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF! -- a thin BLUE FLAME jets into frame.
It’s luminescent and beautiful in the dim surroundings.

The flame doesn’t touch the cigar (the guy working the
lighter knows what he's doing) -- the point of it stops a
centimeter or so from the cigar end, which is angled downward
some forty degrees.

We hold on the pretty flame. Watch, as it BENDS slightly,
sucked into the cigar end as the smoker draws air though it.

The tobacco ignites, starts to GLOW. The cigar TURNS (spun
in the smoker’s fingers) so the wrapper burns evenly around
its circumference, casting a line of gray ash as it recedes.

Thick, white SMOKE billows and floats lazily across the
frame. It’s oddly calming. A contrast for what’s to come...

INT. MEXICAN CANTINA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

REVEAL TORTUGA -- cartel henchman-turned-DEA-snitch from
Episode 207 -- puffing on the cigar as it gets lit. We know
we‘re in flashback because his head is attached. He sits at
the thick, wooden bar of a seedy Mexican CANTINA, wearing his
caballero hat and boots. A barkeep (BETO, male, younger than
Tortuga) stands behind the bar holding the lighter.

We are at a dark watering hole in a one-horse border-town in
rural Juarez -- a place where campesinos, town drunks, and
unemployed youths come to escape the blistering heat and self
medicate themselves into oblivion. No chicas in this joint.

Dingy, rustic, with Spanish-style Western character (arches
and stucco walls would be great). Lines of liquor bottles
behind the bar (maybe shelved in front of plate mirrors)
reflect dim overhead lights and a few neon cervezas signs. A
back KITCHEN (or pantry) abuts the main barroom, separated by
a swinging door.

TWO work-weary LABORERS (character faces: more rural Mayan

than bullet-headed toughs) drink cervezas at the bar a few
seats down from Tortuga.

FIVE or SIX other PATRONS sit at roughly-hewn wood tables,
staring with disinterest at a futbol match playing on an
older model TV over the bar. Just killing time. A lot,
judging from the clutter of empty long-necks lined up like
casualties on the tables.

Beto finishes lighting Tortuga’s cigar. Slides him a beer.
Then pours him a brimming tumbler of tequila. Tortuga downs
it in one throw-back. TAP-TAPS! his glass hard on the bar.
{All dialogue in Teaser is in SPANISH, subtitled in English.]

TORTUGA
More.

Whoa. Beto’s served Tortuga a few times prior, and he’s got
a strong hunch Tortuga is el cartel. Thus, his banter is
amiable with no mind to affront. That said, Tortuga’s got a
treacherous, make-or-break deal going down in a couple of
hours; he’s even surlier than usual.

BETO
(friendly, just kidding)
Careful, sefor. Hot day like
today, too much oil in the machine
can cause it to blow a gasket.

TORTUGA
(beat, scoffs)
There are two kinds of men in the
world. Those who drink, and those
who pour.
(stares coldly)
Shut up and fill my glass.

Uh-oh. A dead silence cuts across the bar. The laborers
shift nervously on their stools, sensing trouble. Beto
refills the tumbler with a shaky hand.

Tortuga fishes for a GOLD MONEY CLIP with a THICK wad of
pesos and dollars. As he plucks out bills to pay for his
drinks, the laborers can’t help but glance at his copious
cash. Tortuga notices their envy. Indeed, he relishes it.

TORTUGA
Hey, you two.
(off patrons: us? gulp!)
Yeah, you. My Mayan brothers. You
know, I used to be just like you?
Good, honest campesinos. Worked
dirt for the man til my hands bled.
(snorts, waves bankroll)
The way you just looked at me...

TORTUGA (CONT'D)
I had that same stupid look on my
mug whenever I saw a rich man flash
his bank. No more. Wanna know
why?

No. They really don’t. But God forbid they show disrespect.
They swallow nervously. Timidly nod their heads.

PATRON #1
Si, sefior.

Tortuga makes them wait for it, while he gulps down his
second tequila. Ahhh! Grits his teeth against the burn.

TORTUGA
I learned that a man can never
drink his fill by waiting in line
for the tap.

Tortuga raises his beer. The laborers share a confused look,
before lifting their own in response. As Tortuga tilts the
bottle...

MAN'S VOICE (0.S)
Bravo, Tortuga.

All other heads TURN toward a MEXICAN MAN, who stands in
bright sunlight streaming through the now open barroom door
(if there are plate mirrors behind the bar, maybe we do a
cool mirror reveal for this).

This is JUAN BOLSA, avuncular, a little paunchy, in his late
50s or 60s. Wearing loose, tropical cotton garments, perhaps
a Panama hat, he may have been a Mexico city bureaucrat
before he turned a dark corner. From a more refined social
stratum than gruff Tortuga, or so he prefers to convey. A
cartel underboss, Bolsa is higher up in our fictional cartel
than Tortuga, but not one of the controlling capos. He
doesn’t look particularly threatening.

Tortuga turns, surprised to see his boss.

TORTUGA
Heyy, howya doin‘, boss!?

Tortuga stands, shakes Bolsa’‘s outstretched hand.
BOLSA
Good to see you, my friend. You
know, I never pegged you for such a
deep thinker.

Tortuga shrugs it off -- ah, it’s nothing.

TORTUGA
I got a lot of thoughts about a lot
of things, boss. There’s no time
or place for them all.

Bolsa slides into a bar stool. Tortuga follows his boss’
cue, his cocky air now replaced by respectful deference.
Tortuga motions to Beto who pours them both tequilas.

TORTUGA
So, what brings you way out here to
this burro’s asshole of a town?

BOLSA
I knew I would find you here.

Tortuga’s eyes widen a notch. Bolsa checks his watch.

BOLSA
Don’t you have a shipment to
deliver in a couple of hours?
Cutting it close, aren’t you?

TORTUGA
Ahhh, lots of time. Tortuga may be
slow out the gate, but he always--

BOLSA
(overlapping him)
--finishes first. Yes, I know,
just like your namesake. I like
the way you talk, Tortuga.

TORTUGA
Yeah?

BOLSA
Yeah. You’ve got such a way with
words. They just roll off your
tongue. I like that about you.

Bosla raises his glass in toast. Tortuga CLINKS it. They
throw back. Bolsa shoots Tortuga a look of apology.

BOLSA
I missed your birthday last month.
(off Tortuga, so what?)
No, I feel terrible. So bad I came
all the way here... to this
‘burro’‘s asshole’... to bring you
my present.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (4)

TORTUGA
Present? Ahh, come on, boss. No
need to go through the trouble.

BOLSA
Forget it, I wanted to. I have it
for you in the kitchen.

Bolsa nods toward the kitchen. Tortuga peers over. The door
is shut. Looks quiet. Foreboding. Like a good place for an
ambush. Tortuga doesn’t like the smell of this. Not at all.

TORTUGA
Back there?

BOLSA
Yes. Come. Follow me.

Bolsa stands, motions for Tortuga as he paces toward the
kitchen. Tortuga hesitates. Oh, shit! If he splits now,
Bolsa will know for certain he’s got something to hide (i.e.,
he’s a snitch) and then he’s a goner for sure. Reluctantly,
he rises, follows Bolsa through the swinging door, into...

INT. MEXICAN CANTINA - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

A grimy, unkempt kitchen. Tortuga, expecting to be jumped,
cautiously files in behind Bolsa. To his relief, however, he
finds the kitchen totally empty -~ PHEW! -- except for...

A very large, familiar TORTOISE crawling across the floor.
It was a present after all! Tortuga explodes in a burst of
relieved laughter. AH-HA-HA-HA-HA!...

TORTUGA
It's perfect!

BOLSA
You really like it?

TORTUGA
I love it! What a great pet it
will make. Thank you, boss!

BOLSA
Excellent. Let me sign it for you.

Bolsa picks up a small CAN of WHITE PAINT and a PAINTBRUSH
from a nearby counter. Squats, begins to paint some letters
with the brush across the animal's shell. Bolsa’s back
shields Tortuga’s (and our) view of what he’s spelling out...

(CONTINUED )
BREAKING BAD #303 "I.F.T." Writer's Draft 8/26/09 6.

BOLSA
Sign it ‘for the big talker’.

Huh? Bolsa finishes painting. He stands and steps aside,
REVEALING...

“H-O-L-A_D-E-A". Tortuga freezes. Oh, FUCK! -- HE KNOWS!!
[Note: This lettering should match what we saw in Episode 207
exactly, as we realize what we're witnessing is the run-up to
a scene we've previously seen].

The door to the kitchen SWINGS OPEN. In file THE COUSINS!

They pace toward Tortuga, eyes on their quarry. One Cousin
grabs a large BUTCHER‘’S KNIFE from the counter.

ON TORTUGA, paralyzed with fear at the sight of these weird,
silent killers, approaching like terrifying forces of
Nature. Or, more precisely, of Death.

His hands shaking, Tortuga fumbles under his shirt for his
gun. But it’s too late. Before he can get a handle on his
weapon, the Cousins grab his arms (Juan Bolsa merely
watches). Tortuga writhes and struggles to free himself.

TORTUGA
No..! No..!

But it’s no use. They hold him down. Wrench his head back
by the hair, exposing his neck like a lamb at the slaughter.

As the knife-wielding Cousin presses the blade to Tortuga’s
throat, arm cocked and ready to saw off his head, we cut to:
INT. MEXICAN CANTINA - DAY - CONTINUOUS
AH-AH~AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHE! ! !
Tortuga’s ear-piercing scream shatters the silence.

The bar patrons lower their heads in terror. Like docile,
beaten-down mules, too scared even to move. Their wide,
vacant eyes glued to their drinks.

Tortuga’s scream reaches an almost inhuman pitch, before it’s

truncated by an odd gurgling sound, and then STOPS.

ACT ONE

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ~ ROOFTOP - DAY

TIGHT ON a dried up PIZZA. Half out of its box and smeared
on the roof. This is the pizza Walt hurled at the end of
Episode 302. If we look carefully, we might see way in the
b.g. MIKE'S BROWN CHRYSLER parked down the street.

A LADDER swings into frame -- CLUNK! -- slams against the
edge of the roof. A pair of bright-yellow RUBBER-GLOVED
HANDS (first one, then the other) grabs onto the top rung...

WALT’S head pokes up into frame. His eyes shift to and fro,
assessing the mess. Shakes his head -- what the hell was I
thinking? He fishes into his back pocket, pulls out a

scrunched up plastic TRASH BAG. Flaps it around, airing it
open. Peels the pizza off the roof, shoves it into the bag.

He takes a damp CLOTH from his other back pocket, scrubs the
cheesy residue off the shingles. As he stops to pluck off a
PEPPERONI slice that has petrified to the roof, we cut to:

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - STREET - DAY - SIMULTANEOUS

MIKE, in his car, spies Walt, while he talks into his CELL
PHONE to Gus’s minion, Victor (whom we do not see or hear).

MIKE

(into phone while spying)
Yeah, he’s breathin’, alright. By
the looks of him, he’s got no idea
how close he came.

(beat)
I‘m assuming Saul Goodman doesn’t
need to know.

(beat)
Mum, it is.

Mike hangs up. Starts the car, pulls away from the curb.
Makes a U-turn to avoid passing by the White house. As
Mike's sedan drives off, we:

INT. SKYLER’S JEEP - DRIVING - DAY
SKYLER drives, while baby HOLLY sits quietly in the car seat

behind her. She sings along to the mind-numbing BABY MUSIC
playing on the car stereo (though she’s not into it):

SKYLER
The wheels on the bus go round and
round, round and round, round and
round...

As Skyler nears the White house, she fumes at the sight of
Walt‘s Aztek parked in the driveway. What?! He's back..?!
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Skyler shuts off the music. Pulls into the driveway behind
the Aztek (but leaves the engine idling). Rifles through her
BABY-BAG for her cell phone and dials Walt:

SKYLER
Walt? Are you in the house?

 

SKYLER’S POV: A hand pulls the curtain of the front window
aside, revealing Walt's face. Cell phone to his ear, he
speaks to Skyler as he peers at her through the window.

WALT
(filtered, almost chipper)
Oh, hi. Yep... it’s me. I’m back.

SKYLER
(beat, vexed)
No, you‘re not, Walt. Get out of
the house.

WALT
(calm, simply explaining)
It’s my house, too, Skyler. I’m
staying. For good.

SKYLER
We had an agreement.
WALT
I didn’t agree to anything.

(beat)
Look, come on inside. We'll talk
this through.

SKLYER
--No. There’s nothing to talk
about. I’m not coming in until you
get... OUT.

WALT

(long beat, shrugs)
Suit yourself.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Walt vanishes back behind the curtain. Skyler, bewildered,
hangs up. Stares in disbelief out the windshield at the
Aztek. Last night was frisbee pizza, now breaking and
entering? Her anger mounts, until she’s nearly trembling.

Then, little Holly, cueing off her mom's anxiety, starts to
stir and fuss -- weh-weh!...weh! -- in back. Skyler glances
over her shoulder. Ugh! Not going to win this standoff with
a restless baby in the car. In utter frustration, she shuts
off the car. As she shoves the door open, we cut to:

INT. WHITE HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Skyler barges through the front door, holding the car seat
with Holly strapped in. She spots Walt at the dining room
table, casually grading exams as if nothing is awry.

She sets the car seat down on the living room floor (Holly is
awake but, of course, now quiet). Storms toward Walt.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Walt looks up, sees her charging. Puts his pen down, sits up

straight, and waits with his hands clasped on the table.
Like Lord Nelson under fire, a picture of calm.

SKYLER
What is wrong with you?! You're
trespassing! How did you even... I

changed the locks!

WALT
(beat, calmly explaining)
Skyler, I have every right to be
here.

SKYLER
No, you do not. You don’t live
here any more. We are getting a
divorce.

WALT
I don’t agree to a divorce.

SKYLER

It’s not up to you!

(beat, “ok, that’s it”)
If you don’t get out right now, I
will call the police and I will
tell them everything.

(a beat)
I mean it, Walt!

(CONTINUED )

CONTINUED:

A long beat. Walt shrugs. Nods toward the phone.

WALT
Go ahead. There’s the phone.

Skyler cocks her head. Oh, you think I'm kidding? She grabs
a phone book off the counter, rapidly fans through the pages
until she finds the number for the police. Snatches up the
phone and dials. Eyes fixed on Walt, she waits for the call
to go through. Then, with demonstrative aplomb, flips the
receiver around and holds it out, ear piece towards Walt...

SKYLER
(don’t fuck with me)

It's ringing.
But Walt is serious, too. He’1ll either live in this house,

or go to prison. There is no third way. Through the out-
turned receiver, we faintly can hear the operator answer.

APD OPERATOR
(filtered)
Albuquerque police department.

Beat. Skyler huffs. Rights the receiver and talks into it:

SKYLER
I want to report a disturbance,
please.
(beat)
No, it’s not... not exactly a...

It's a domestic issue.

(beat, then to Walt)
They’re connecting me. Right hand
to God, I will tell them.

 

WALT
(total resignation)
Do what you have to do, Skyler.
This family is everything to me.
Without it I got nothing to lose.

Walt’s total lack of fear in the face of her threat, his
Buddha-like acceptance of whatever may happen, only stokes
her anger. Is he not taking her seriously?

SKYLER
Fine.
(beat, into receiver)
Yes, officer. My name is Skyler
White. I need police assistance at
my home right away.

SKYLER (CONT'D)

My soon to be ex-husband broke into
my house. I-I need an officer to
come and remove him.

(beat)
It’s Thirty-Eight Twenty-Eight
Negra Arroyo Lane.

(longer beat)
Okay... okay. Thank you.

Skyler hangs up. Finger raised, lays down the law.

SKYLER
They‘re coming. If you do not get
out of here right now, you are
going to jail. And it’s all gonna
be on you.

Beat. Walt goes back to grading his papers. Skyler
continues to stare at him. Who is this man? Has he lost all
fear for the law? Square-jawed and determined to find out,
she turns and... and now what..?

Arms crossed, Skyler wanders into the living room, sits down
on the couch, and... she waits. Ugh! Stewing in
excruciating silence.

ANGLE ON the LIVING ROOM CLOCK. Seconds slowly tick-tick-
ticking away “High-Noon” style, as Skyler’s moment of truth --
when she makes good on her threat to tell the police on Walt
or not -- gets closer. And closer. And closer. A grueling,
nerve-wracking, tediously slow burn...

, we hear O.S. the sound of an APPROACHING CAR!
Sie leaps up off the couch. Nearly runs to the front
door... But right before she gets there, it SWINGS OPEN...

An upbeat WALTER, JR. clunks in. Just in time for the
fireworks. Perfect! Skyler frowns. She’s not mad at her
son ~- but he’s the last complication she wants to deal with
right now. In contrast, Walter, Jr. (having seen the Aztek
outside) is upbeat, thrilled by the prospect of seeing his
father, whom he spots across the room. Upbeat:

WALTER JR.
Dad’s here.

SKYLER
Why are you home so early?

WALTER, JR.
I‘m not.

Skyler glances at the clock -- terrific. Walt emerges from
the dining room.

WALT
Hey, son.

WALTER, JR.

Dad, you're back..! For good?

Walt shrugs -- let's hope so.

WALT
(evading)
Hey, I’m starving. You want a
grilled cheese?

WALTER, JR.
Ah... sure. I guess.

Walt crosses to the kitchen. On the way, he asks Skyler...

WALT
Want one, , too?

Skyler glowers in reply. She turns to Walter, Jr.

SKYLER
Walter, your father and I have
something to discuss. It's
private.
(beat, do as I say)
I‘ll bring your sandwich to your
room when it’s ready.

WALTER, JR.
Mom, I haven't seen Dad in, like...

forever.
Walter, Jr. turns his back on her, heads to the kitchen.

SKYLER
Walter..?

Walter, Jr.'s fed up being kept in the dark. And he's
genuinely glad to see his dad. In his teenager’s mind, how
could this not be a step in the right direction, even if
mom’s not yet on board? Off Skyler’s isolation:

INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER
CLOSE ON a PIECE OF TOASTED BREAD, with greasy melting cheese
on top, frying in a PAN. We watch as another piece of toast

is laid DOWN on top of it, then pressed with a spatula.
Cheese goops out the sides and sizzles.

PULL BACK to reveal Walt, standing over the stove, working
the spatula. Walter, Jr. leans against the counter nearby.

As father and son chat, Skyler (visible in the b.g.) paces in
front of the living room window. Baby Holly is asleep near
her, now in a bassinet. Though Walter, Jr.‘s arrival is
highly unfortunate, she hasn‘t lost her resolve. But man,
those cops are taking their sweet time!

WALTER, JR.
You gonna be at work tomorrow?

WALT
That‘s the plan.

WALTER, JR.
Good. Cause everyone's saying that
sub they got for you really sucks.

WALT
Everyone, wow. Well, don’t believe
everything you hear. But... it’s

good to be missed.
Finally, we hear 0.S., DING-DONG! In the b.g., anxious
Skyler rushes toward the door.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Skyler opens to reveal two APD PATROLMEN, a SENIOR OFFICER
(40s, male) and a ROOKIE OFFICER (younger, male or female).

SENIOR OFFICER
Hello, ma‘am. Are you the one who
called the police?

SKYLER
Yes, that was me.

Just then, Walter, Jr. walks into the foyer area behind
Skyler. A look of shock comes over him.

WALTER, JR.
You called the cops on Dad? What
the hell‘s WRONG with you?!
OFF Skyler, mortified, we...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Skyler stands with the Senior Officer. Per police protocol,
the cops have separated the spouses. We can see in the b.g.
Walt being questioned by the Rookie Officer in the dining
room. Walter Jr. sits on a bar stool on the dining room side
of the breakfast bar -- confused, silent, scared.

Skyler is nervous, even more anxious now that Walt has called
her bluff and she is being put to the task. The Senior
Officer, on the other hand, has responded to dozens of
domestic calls in his career, and he’s got certain
preliminary questions he must ask as a matter of procedure.
He jots down occasional notes on a pad.

SKYLER
I-I came home from work and he was
back. Just moved back in. I asked
him to leave, but he won't listen.
I, ah... I just want him out. I
want him out of the house.

SENIOR OFFICER

(polite)
Okay, Mrs. White. There's a couple
questions I need to ask you right
off the bat. It’s very important
that you answer them honestly.

(beat)
Did he strike you?

SKYLER
No.

SENIOR OFFICER
Has he ever hit you?

SKYLER
(frustration mounting)
No. This is not about violence.
This is about trespassing. About
him being here against my will.

The cop has heard “no violence” before, only to be called
back later when the wife is beaten to a pulp. He turns,
checks to make sure Walt’s not eyeballing her into silence
from afar. But Walt appears to be cooperating, fully engaged
with the rookie cop. Does not even appear agitated at all.

SENIOR OFFICER

Okay. Trespassing. You‘re
divorced, then?

(CONTINUED)

SKYLER
No, working on it. Right now,
we're separated.

SENIOR OFFICER
(I can work with that)
Legally separated.

As he starts to make a note in his pad...

SKYLER
Well... there’s no court order, if
that’s what you mean. But we've
been living apart for-for... almost
two weeks. Give or take.

The cop looks up from his pad. So much for cut and dry.
SKYLER
Look, I changed the locks. Isn't
that breaking and entering?

SENIOR OFFICER
Whose name is on the title to the

house?

SKYLER
Both of us are. It's, ah, jointly
owned.

SENIOR OFFICER

We can’t arrest a man for breaking
into his own house. Not without an
order from the court requiring him
to stay away from the premises.

(beat, tries again)
Unless he‘s threatened you or the
kids in any way?

SKYLER
(frustrated, but can’t
pull the trigger)
No. Not physically. But having
him in the house is... it’s not...
it’s just not a good thing.

WEH-WEH-WEEEEEEEAAAAAHHH!! -- baby Holly stops Skyler mid-
sentence with a startling, screeching CRY. And what a cry!
One of those “my-child-is-possessed-by-a-demon” shrieks of
anger and injustice and hunger. Skyler’s head swivels toward
the sound. The Senior Officer turns, too, as we:

INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERCUTTING

SKYLER'S/SENIOR OFFICER'S POV: Walt rushes from the dining
room to Holly. Lifts her from the bassinet. Gently bounces
her in his arms, soothing her.

WALT
Shhhhhh. It's okay, baby.

Holly’s fussiness starts to ease. Walt flashes Skyler a
kindly look from the living room - I got it, no problem.
Walt picks up a half-full bottle of formula from inside the
bassinet. He feeds it to Holly while he paces back to the
rookie cop (who now stands at the threshold of the living
room). Like a perfect, even-tempered, responsible father.

WALT
Sorry about that. Where were we?

ROOKIE OFFICER
(checks notes)
Disagreements.

WALT
Right. Yes, we've been having... a
few problems. She‘’s not in the
wrong. I’ve not been the most
attentive husband, lately. I’ve
been... a little distant. Cold.

As Walt bores the rookie cop to tears, he doesn’t look so
unattentive. In fact, as he deftly feeds the baby, Walt
appears more like a dutiful (if not whipped) house-husband.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - INTERCUTTING

The Senior Officer turns back to Skyler, now off her game
plan, watching Walt feed the baby. Regains her attention:

SENIOR OFFICER
Mrs. White. Would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

SKYLER
Um... no. I’m-I‘m fine right here.

To the officer, this call is looking like a nonviolent
(albeit heated) marital disagreement, the cops called in to
up the ante. It happens. But he’s covered too many ill-
fated domestics to not be wary. And he senses Skyler is
holding something back. He wants to give her every
opportunity to say something that might give him authority to
kick Walt out.

CONTINUED:

SENIOR OFFICER

I’m gonna level with you, Mrs.
White. If you want your husband
out of the house, you gotta help me
out. If he’s broken any laws that
you know of, anything at all, you
should tell me that.

(long beat, encouraging)
Even if you just got a suspicion of
some wrongdoing, I'll work it out.
I‘ll get him out of here for you.

And there it is -- the “law” practically begging her to make
good on her threat.

Skyler exhales deeply. Digs to regain her mettle, as she
locks eyes with Walt across the room. So nauseatingly Gandhi-
like and passive. She's sick of his smug manipulations and
bullshit, his imprisonment of her. She warned him. To hell
with him! Skyker looks at the cop in front of her. Then,
just as she’s about to turn Walt in:

ROOKIE OFFICER
What’s your take on all this, young
man?

SKYLER‘S POV: From across the living room, Skyler glimpses
the Rookie Officer now questioning her son.

(distraught)
It’s my Mom’s fault! She won’t say
what my dad did because he didn’t
do anything. She’s nuts! My Dad,
he’s a great guy.

Skyler stops herself. She wants so badly to vindicate
herself, scream out the truth. But she just can’t do it.

A long beat, as the officer reads her. Finally, he concludes
she’s got nothing to tell him. Reaches into his pocket for a
card.

SENIOR OFFICER

Sorry, ma‘am. We have no legal
basis to remove your husband from
the house.

Next time you feel that things are
getting out of control, you should
call that number. That’s the

The Senior Officer motions across the room for his partner.
The Rookie Officer crosses to the front door to meet him.
Walt follows to see the police out, while Skyler sits down on
the couch, utterly humiliated.

SENIOR OFFICE
Best of luck to you folks.

WALT
Thank you, Officers.

The two cops head out. As soon as they leave, Walter, Jr.'s

anger at Skyler explodes:

WALTER, JR.
How _c: that t !

Walter, Jr. storms off toward his room. Walt calls out:

WALT
Son, wait... Don’t blame your
mother for this.

But it falls on deaf ears. 0O.S., we hear his bedroom door
SLAM shut as he locks himself in. Skyler, seething in her
defeat, walks up to Walt. Takes the baby from his arms.

SKYLER
(calm, but venomous)
Welcome home.
She, too, disappears down the hallway. SLAMS the door to her
bedroom. Off grim Walt, stewing in his “victory”...

ACT TWO

INT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

LOW and WIDE ON JESSE, knees to chest, sitting on the floor.
His back is propped against a newly-painted bare wall.

We’re in the living room of Jesse’s big “new” house. No
furniture yet. Nothing but a field of glossy hardwood floor
in the f.g., bathed in a pale sunlight slipping through the
window. Dwarfed by the wall, Jesse stares introspectively
off into the empty space. A lonely tableau.

Several moments pass, before he fishes a cell phone from his
pocket. Presses speed dial, puts the receiver to his ear.
When the call goes through (we don’t hear it), a faint,
nostalgic smile creases his face. It’s a sweet moment. A
fleeting glimpse of the Jesse we knew before the plane crash,
the addiction, the loss. What did he just hear?

DING-DONG, the doorbell rings. Jesse hangs up. But he
doesn’t budge. He’s got no desire to see anyone.

DING-DONG, again. Followed by a hard KNOCK-KNOCK! Jesse
considers. Whoever it is knows he’s inside. He pockets the
phone. Rises, paces slowly to the door. Opens, to find...

SAUL, wearing a shit-eating grin. He holds a cheap, pathetic-
looking POTTED CACTUS, the kind you get from Ralph's. Jesse
is not thrilled to see him (he’s been dodging Saul’s calls).

SAUL
He lives!
(off deadpan Jesse)
Happy housewarming, kid. Don‘t
look so glad to see me.

Saul hands him the cactus. Oh, boy.

JESSE
Cool. Thanks.

Saul waits to be invited inside. Jesse would prefer not to,
but Saul did just help him fleece his parents for the crib.
Reluctantly, he steps aside. Saul files in, looks around the
empty space. Jesse sets the cactus down by the window sill.

SAUL
Interesting decor. Subtle. The
whole minimalist thing never blew
my hair back, but hey.
(off Jesse)
So. Howya doing? Staying clean?

(CONTINUED )
BREAKING BAD #303 “I.F.T." Writer's Draft 8/26/09 20.
CONTINUED:

Jesse nods -- yeah.

SAUL

Good. I was kinda worried you were
back to your old habits, since I
didn’t hear from you. You got any
idea how stupid it is to ignore
your counsel’s calls?

(beat)
What if I was tryin’ to warn you
the DEA was about to kick in your
door? What then, huh?

JESSE
How’s about you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

SAUL

(beat, resets)
Fair enough. The other day, when I
brought up the idea about you
gettin’ back in touch with your
partner. Well, I kinda wanna re-
float that boat.

(beat, Jesse is blank)
Don’t get all excited. I'm not
suggesting you yourself get back to
cooking. You being in rehab and
all, that would be... beyond the
pale, even for me.

(beat)
I care about you, kid. I only want
you to convince the master-chef to
do his thing. So... Whaddya say?

Jesse gets it. Unlike Walt, he’s not essential to Saul’s
deal with Gus. In fact, Jesse's irrelevant. For any meth
cook with a smidgen of pride, it’s a major snub. But Jesse
appears not to care. Even gives a half-hearted shrug:

JESSE
Sure, man. Whatever.

Jesse tries to show him to the door. But:
SAUL
Whoa, whoa, hold on. ‘Whatever’
what? You gonna talk to him?
JESSE

I said, I'll handle it. Now,
bounce, will ya, please.

(CONTINUED)

Saul reads him. Still skeptical. But for now, he’s played
his hand. Throws him the Saul finger point.

SAUL

Final thought.
(re: the empty house)

Look at this place. You’re house
poor, you got no bankroll. You get
the maestro cooking again, I can
make it worth your while. Call
him.

Saul leaves. Alone again, Jesse heads back to his perch at
the wall. Sits, tries to clear his mind. But he can’t.

He reaches for his cell again. Speed dials. This time, we
hear what he was listening to before: JANE‘'S VOICEMAIL
MESSAGE (established in Episode 213):

JANE (RECORDED V.O.)
Hey. If you're trying to sell me
something, I‘ve got four little
words for you: “Do-Not-Call-List.”
However, if you're cool, leave it
at the beep.

BEEP. He hangs up. Off Jesse’s loss:

INT. DEA ABQ - HANK’S OFFICE - DAY
CLOSE ON a BLUE PUSHPIN, pinched between strong fingers.

We PULL BACK to reveal HANK. He sits at his desk, phone to
his ear. He’s hoping to find a spot to stick this pin. Laid
out before him is the previously established MAP of the
Southwest, riddled with blue push-pins marking all the
locations where Walt's blue magic has turned up.

But it’s been at least a month since any blue meth has been
reported. Hank is on the phone with an agent in the field,
hoping to hear some good news. But to his disappointment...

HANK
No blue stuff, huh?
(beat, deflated)
Alright. Let me know if you hear
of anything.

Hank chucks the pin back in it‘s plastic box. Just then,
ASAC MERKERT pops into Hank's office.

ASAC
Hey, Schrader. Got a minute?

(CONTINUED )
BREAKING BAD #303 “I.F.T." Writer's Draft 8/26/09 22.
CONTINUED:

HANK
Yeah, sure, boss. What’s up?

The ASAC sits down in front of Hank’s desk. He looks proud
of himself, exudes a sense of accomplishment.

ASAC
I made a few phone calls, got
Dallas and D.C. in the loop. To be
frank, I had to pull out a couple
of stops for you, Hank.

HANK
Yeah?

ASAC
Bottom line, I just got off the
phone with El Paso. They agreed to
have you back.

HANK
(beat)
Hey, that’s great! Thanks, boss!

ASAC
You deserve it. It’s good for your
career, good for our department.
And I know you'll prove me right,
that you're the best man for the
job.

HANK
Oh, you can bet on that.

ASAC
(as he gets up)
As soon as you get your house in
order, you're good to go. You just
let me know when.

HANK
Alright. Will do.

As Hank watches (through the glass) the ASAC cross the
bullpen, his excited expression fades to a grim frown. We
remember his PTSD. Uh-oh. Off Hank‘s anxious preoccupation:
EXT. PARKING LOT - BINGO PARLOR - DAY
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHH!...

We FOLLOW CLOSE ON a RUBBER-TIRED WHEEL, spinning across
pavement to the whining drone of an electric motor.

WIDEN to reveal a FEMALE RETIREE (dumpling-shaped, pushing
70, but feisty -- we‘ll call her “AUNT”) zipping across a
parking lot in her RASCAL SCOOTER. In the b.g., a BINGO
PARLOR (or other place where older folks congregate).

The camera FOLLOWS her as she motors down a row of parked
cars to a HANDICAP VAN. She stops, presses some buttons on a
REMOTE CONTROL. Unlocking it and LOWERING the WHEELCHAIR
LIFT. As she scoots forward onto the lift, we hear the CLOP-
CLOP-CLOP of approaching boots. The footsteps stop.

ANGLE CLOSE ON two pairs of COWBOY BOOTS, ornamented with...
Oh, no... not those menacing silver SKULLS!

Aunt presses a button on the remote. The lift starts to
raise her. Sensing a presence behind her back, she cranes
her neck over her shoulder as far as she can -- ehh!-ehh!
But with her older ligaments, she just can’t get a good
look... until the lift reaches full height and she sees...

The Cousins! (Note: maybe we place the camera on the
wheelchair lift, so it rises into the reveal of The Cousin's
faces in Auntie’s POV as she looks over her shoulder).
Death’s Doppelgangers are a frightening spectacle. But our
feisty lady, God bless her, still manages a smile.

AUNT
Hello.

No response. OFF the wide-eyed Aunt, we:

TIMECUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - BINGO PARLOR - DAY

A TIGHT shot of the Cousins, now sitting in the front seats
of the parked Handi-Van. The Cousin in the driver's seat
starts up the vehicle. As the van PULLS AWAY, we cut to:

The REAR END of the Handi-van, with a BUMPER STICKER that
reads “ASK ME ABOUT MY CATS.” The WHEEL of the scooter, now
toppled on its side, spins in the f.g. Poor Auntie.

Off the image of this spinning wheel:

EXT. POULTRY FARM - ESTABLISHING - DAY

LOW ANGLE between two long, weathered SHEDS with corrugated
walls and sloping roofs, stretched out before us the length
of a football field. A weirdly-muffled, low MURMUR of bird
infestation emanates from everywhere and no place in
particular.

The sound is creepy, juxtaposed against the institutional-
looking barracks-shaped sheds -- like the Place is some kind
of aviary Auschwitz.

INT. POULTRY FARM (STOCK) - BROILER SHED - DAY

A sea of obese CHICKENS. Tens of thousands of them, packed
wing to wing, head to tail, foraging on the ground inside a
long BROILER SHED. The bird sound is deafening. They cluck-
cluck and peck-peck at each other in overcrowded agitation,
competing for bits of feed buried in the shit and the dirt.
(Note: let's use stock footage, making sure the farm is for
broilers -- raised for meat, not eggs -~ so the shed interior
reflects the proper farming technique, i.e., the birds are
fed crowded together on the ground, not kept in stacked cages
for egg laying).

EXT. POULTRY FARM - DAY

WIDE ANGLE to give a view of the whole farm ~- some SIX long
BROILER SHEDS lined up parallel. This is Gus’s industrial
chicken farm, a major operation that raises for slaughter
some half a million birds at a time.

A dirt road runs alongside the sheds. Between the sheds and
the road, there’s a MOBILE OFFICE TRAILER, like a foreman
would have on a construction site. A small DIRT PARKING LOT
is next to the office, with a single American-made SEDAN
(Gus‘s car). Besides Gus’s car, no other signs of workers
today (perhaps it’s a weekend). Beyond the farm, nothing but
sun-scorched plains for miles, with train tracks slicing
through. We’re in the middle of nowhere.

LOW ANGLE on the OFFICE -- from across the dirt road and down
a ways. A WHEEL ZIPS through the frame, coughing up dust.

As the vehicle distances, we see the rear end of deceased
Auntie’s Handi-Van (there’s that familiar “Ask Me About My
Cats” bumper sticker again) heading toward the office.

The Handi-Van pulls into the dirt lot, a comfortable distance
from Gus’s car. The Cousins climb out. Open the elevator
door. Using the Handi-Van lift -- WEEEEEHHH! -- they
lower... you guessed it -- TIO! In his wheelchair.

As our killers finish lowering Tio, they hear the GRUMBLING
approach of another car. They turn to the sound and wait:

INT. OFFICE TRAILER - POULTRY FARM - DAY

TIGHT ON a sheet of Saran Wrap -- SCHWEEEK! -- as it’s peeled
off a snack tray. Carrots, celery, dip, maybe some cut
pineapple and melon chunks. Coffee, a pitcher of iced tea.

TILT UP to REVEAL GUS, alone, meticulously laying out this
spread for his soon-to-arrive guests. Getting things just
so. We’re inside the office, which is nothing fancy, just
like you would find at a construction site: a standard desk,
phones, a bunch of file cabinets, coffee machine and fridge,
and a conference table front and center.

The sound of a SLAMMING DOOR grabs Gus‘s attention. He peers
outside through the window at...

GUS‘s POV THROUGH WINDOW: Juan Bolsa -- the cartel underboss
whom we met in the teaser -- walks from his parked AIRPORT
RENTAL SEDAN and greets the COUSINS with warm hugs. Then, he
leans close to Tio, clasps Tio’s bell hand in both of his
own. A warm, respectful greeting.

Gus studies his guests at beat. Then, steps to the door:

Gus gestures for them to come inside the trailer.

GUS
Please, come in. I apologize that

down Gus‘s offer in Episode 301.

Bolsa glances at Tio and the Cousins, who are getting more
and more impatient. Bolsa gives them a subtle nod -- a
petition for calm. Then, he begins to speak for them:

BOLSA

Tuco,

He was loyal.

So, now you see... blood must be

exact vengeance. The Salamanca
family, the cartel, everyone stands
shoulder to shoulder on this.

knows all of this. However, as always, he keeps what he
knows close to the vest. Addressing Tio and the Cousins:

loss deeply. Please accept my
condolences. I have no issue with
your right to vengeance. And I do
not stand in the way of justice.

bell and grinds his jaw -- wrong answer! The Cousins stare
coldly at Gus, who doesn’t flinch. Bolsa calms Tio down.

Not meant as an insult. Bolsa says this somewhat casually --
but the seriousness, the warning here, is clear.

GUS
Do I not run my own territory?

BOLSA

Of course you do. And I will
advise them to be patient. But I
recommend you finish your business

INT. WHITE HOUSE - NURSERY - NIGHT

OVERHEAD ANGLE on Walt, as he tosses and turns on an AIR
MATTRESS on the floor. Wide awake in his new makeshift
sleeping quarters, unable to get comfortable.

A POLICE SIREN sounds in the far distance. Not startling.
Just a subtle reminder of the constant threat of Skyler, or
anyone, disclosing Walt’s secrets. Off Walt, wide-eyed and
restless:

INT. WHITE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
A CLOUD OF SMOKE wafts lazily through the air.

WIDEN to REVEAL Skyler, sitting in a chair she’s pulled to an
OPEN WINDOW, pensively smoking a cigarette. Her feet propped
up on the sill. A picture of melancholy. This completes the
picture of the new “normal” in the White house: two sad,
discontent people living separately under the same roof.

Holly, in a bassinet across the room (a “safe” distance from
the smoke), starts to cry. Skyler snuffs out her cigarette.
Pads over to the crib, holds the crying child to her chest.
After a few beats, Walt calls out from the hallway:

WALT (0.S.)
Skyler..? Want some help?

Skyler ignores him.

Walt, now standing in the hallway. He tries to turn the
knob. It’s locked. He continues to wait until the baby
quiets down. Then, in a pleading (slightly pathetic) voice:

WALT
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

Again, no answer. Walt crinkles his nose, catching a whiff
of something. Smoke?! Not only has Walt lost master
bathroom rights, Skyler is smoking in there with the baby?!
Man, does this piss him off. Walt turns, tries Walter, Jr.'s

as in Episode 301) rants with conviction, Jesse appears
bored. We get the feeling he’s coming here only by routine.

expected. Remember, you’re
starting over from scratch.

JESSE

That‘s right. Just like it’s not
good to dwell on the past, we can’t
obsess about what’s coming tomorrow
or the day after. Take it day by
day, minute by minute. That’s what
it means to live in the “now.”

Skyler sighs. She’s never told a soul about what Walt has
done, not even Marie. But after what happened yesterday, she
needs to unburden to somebody. She’d never admit it, but
this is perhaps the reason she is here.

up on the internet.

Pamela raises a brow at her. Then sits back, in deep
concentration. Perhaps Skyler hoped for more sympathy, an
“Oh, my God, you poor thing.” But sober professional advice
is all she’s going to get from this lady. After a long beat:

PAMELA

This is my advice and you should
take it,

Sue your husband for divorce
immediately. Let me go to the
police and tell them what you just
told me. I‘11 go in ex parte and
get a restraining order from the
court today. If he comes anywhere

SKYLER

How's Walt’s secret meth life going

to make him look to his boss? For

all I know, he could be fired.
(beat, overwhelmed)

God, I... I’m sorry, I... I just

feel so... so trapped.

An emotional beat, as Pamela lets Skyler gather herself.

PAMELA
You have to do what’s best for you
and your kids. And that does not
entail living with a meth cook.

SKYLER

You're right, it doesn’t. But
Walt... he’s got lung cancer. His
treatment bought him some time.
But the doctors... they all say his
cancer is probably going to come
back, sooner or later.

(beat, almost ashamed to

say it)
I-I don’t know what the future
holds in store. But... I can’t see
why I should lay all of this on my
family... when things may resolve
themselves soon enough on their own
without anyone else needing to
know?

Pamela is not unsympathetic. She understands why Skyler
wants to keep quiet about Walt’s crimes, even though she
doesn't agree it’s the right, or the smartest, path. In any
event, it appears her client has made up her mind. For now.

PAMELA
Well. I still stand by my advice.
I guess you just aren’t ready for
it.

Quite true. Off Skyler’s sober acknowledgment:

INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY

Hank and Gomez sit at a table in a rathole of a bar. Dark,
seedy -- a pit stop for the freshly sprung from Los Cruces

hard up to score some crank and wet their tip in one of the
resident bag-whores. If there’s blue meth anywhere in Duke
City, it’s gonna be here.

Two METH-SKELLS (wiry and tough-looking) drink jet fuel a few
tables over. Other DEGENERATES scattered about the place. A
couple TOUGH HOMBRES shoot cue in the back, squabbling
indecipherably.

Though Hank and Gomez are in plainclothes, their clean-cut
appearance screams out “cop.” Or “chump.” Either way,
they're unwelcome. Rude glances flash their way.

It's lunchtime, but most people wouldn’t deign to eat here.
Goopy, diarrhea-~colored nachos are set out at the table
before them. Gomez scrutinizes them with disgust.

GOMEZ
What‘re we doing in this shithole,
anyway?

HANK

Just relax.

GOMEZ
Relax? This is a good place to get
knifed. We should’ve gone to
Chili’s, man.

HANK
(scanning the bar)
We ate there three times last week.
What‘s wrong with spicin’ things up
a little.

GOMEZ
(re: the brown nachos)
This spice looks like it’s run
through a coupla guys before us.

A few beats pass, while Hank gives the “once-over” to the
tough-looking Meth Skells. Doesn’t like the looks of them.

GOMEZ

So, when ya headin’ back down to El
Paso, anyway?

HANK
Ah, you know. Between all the

in a row... maybe a week or two.

GOMEZ
Week or two? Come on, man. I'd be
dying to get back to the action.
You gonna clean that place up good.

This ruffles Hank’s feathers. A hot-button topic.

HANK
Yeah, well, it’s not like there's
nothing goin’ on up here.

GOMEZ
What‘re you talking about? Ain’t
jack going on up here.

Hank scoffs. Gomez studies him -- what's wrong with you?

HANK
I’m hittin’ the head.

He crosses to the bathroom, leaving Gomez to wonder at his
reaction. On the way, Hank takes a good long look at the two
nearby Meth Skells.

HANK'S POV: One of them hands the other one something in a
closed fist. Could be money for drinks, could be drugs.
They catch Hank staring at them. Sneer -- what the fuck you
looking at? Hanks glares back, but keeps his bearings.

INT. SEEDY BAR — BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Hank finishes up at the urinal, walks over to the sink. He
stews a moment in front of the mirror. Even lowlife
pipeheads are showing him no respect. Motherfuckers.

His agitation builds, his breath quickening. 0h, no, not
this again! Leaning over the sink, he splashes water on his
face. Struggles to control his breathing. Hold it together,
Hank... Atta boy, hold it together. His anxiety starts to
subside. Phew! Close call. He regains his composure.
Splashes water on his face. Then he heads back out.

INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Hank sits back down next to Gomez, who is nursing his soda
and itching to go. The unpaid BILL is on the table. Hank
shoots another look at the Meth Skells. Can‘t let it alone.

Shit, man. In this place, the
bartender’s probably holdin’.

Hank looks at him -- you with me or what? Gomez is
skeptical, but he’s always got Hank's back. Reluctantly:

GOMEZ
Alright.

He pulls out his cellphone. Starts to dial.

HANK
Whoa, whoa, what’re you doing?

GOMEZ
Callin’ APD. Whaddya think?

HANK
What the hell you doin’ that for?
We can handle a couple dirtballs.

GOMEZ

I ain’t sayin’ we can’t handle it.
But if we roust ‘em without runnin’
it by the locals, ASAC‘1l be all up

(off Hank's frown)
Come on, man. Courtesy call. What
if vice is runnin’ some kinda
undercover op we don’t know about.

Hank is pissed. But Gomez has got a good point.
HANK
Screw it. Your turn to pay. Meet
you in the car.

Hank shuttles out of the bar, leaving Gomez to pay up.

EXT. SEEDY BAR - STREET - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Hank sits behind the wheel of his JEEP COMMANDER, the bar
visible in the b.g. He can’t stop seething over the two
thugs inside. He starts to get hit with another wave of
anxiety. Only this time, it’s stronger. He sucks wind. His
blood boils over, until, finally -- Fuck This..!

And now he does something strange. Disregarding all rules of
peace officer protocol (and common sense), Hank...

...unfastens his holster. He stashes his sidearm under the
driver's seat. Jumps down out of the Commander, heads back
toward the bar. Crosses Gomez coming out.

GOMEZ
Where ya going? I just paid up.

HANK
Gotta take another leak.

GOMEZ
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

Gomez watches Hank disappear into the bar. He shrugs.
Climbs into the passenger seat and waits...

INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Hank cuts across the bar with a vengeance. The two Meth
Skells spy him coming. What the..? He steps right up to
them. Wide-eyed, fists balled low at his sides. A tense
beat as they stare from their seats.

SKELL #1
You gotta problem with us... bitch?
HANK
(beat)
Stand up.

The Meth Skells rise. Glare right in Hank’s face. For
several long moments, they stand like a triad of trees,
elbows flared, wooden and mute. Until, finally...

HANK
Your move.

A short beat. Then, suddenly, Skell #1 tries to steal a
punch, and it’s on! (We're in close, at odd angles, so we
feel we're immersed in the brutality.) Hank ducks it, comes
back with a hard right -- AHH! -- into Skell #1’s kidneys.
Skell #1 staggers, clutching his side in pain, as...

Skell #2 swings at Hank from the blind. Hank dodges and
deflects, locks the Skell’s arm. Wrenches it, spins him into
awall. But now Skell #1, back in the mix, lands an uppercut
to Hank’s body. UGH! Not good. Hank stumbles, cringing.

And here comes Skell #2 again -~ swinging a BEER BOTTLE down
like a mallet at Hank’s head.

(CONTINUED )
BREAKING BAD #303 "I.F.T." Writer's Draft 8/26/09 40.
CONTINUED:

Hank dips low and blocks the makeshift cudgel with his
forearm. Lurches and swings his fist, almost from the floor,
low and hard -- OOOOFFF! -- doubling him like a bag of rice.

Hank grabs the back of Skell #2's head two-handed, pulls down
while driving up with his knee -- WHAMM!! -- into Skell #2's
face. Skell #2 hits the floor hard, rolling half-conscious.

Skell #1, frantic at the fate of his compadre, scans for
weaponry. Grabs the back of a chair. But as he turns to
swing it -- SNAPP! -- Hank fouls him up with a palm strike to
the chin, Skell #1 reels back. Hank seizes him by the neck,
spins and body SLAMS him into a table, breaking its legs and
collapsing it to the floor. Hank riding down on top of him.

Not yet depleted of fight, Skell #1 reaches up double claw-
handed, tries to pry out Hank‘s eyeballs with his thumbs.
Hank lets loose an animal growl, grips Skell #1’s hair in
both hands. Hammers the man’s head into the floor, over and
over again, until he is duly pacified.

Kneeling over him, Hank cocks a fist in rage, about to do
grave damage to the now defenseless man. But then stops
himself.

He falls back on his knees, clutching the limp head trophy-
like by its hair, blood tricking down from its scalp and
dripping from one ear. Stares at it, eyes crazed with
adrenalin. Then, as if aghast at his own doing, shrinks back
and lets the head flop to the floor with a PLUNK.

Hank stands, breathing hard. Pulls cuffs from his pocket...

HANK
D-E-A. Don‘t move.

Yeah. Now he says it. He starts to cuff the two skells,
groaning and face down on the floor. Looks up and sees the
bartender watching, open-mawed and speechless.

HANK
Go on out, tell my partner to get
his ass in here.

A beat. The bartender slowly backpeddles a few steps.

Before he turns and rushes outside. Off Hank, struggling to
bridle his PTSD-fueled fear and rage...

ACT FOUR

INT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

OVERHEAD ANGLE on Jesse, prone in his SLEEPING BAG on the
floor. Like Walt, not getting much shut-eye these days.

Restless, he reaches beside him for his cell phone. Presses
speed dial. He’s been doing this a lot lately. This time,
however, before the message finishes...

JANE (RECORDED V.0.)
Hey. If you're trying to sell me
something, I've got four little
words for you: Do-Not-Call...

The message CUTS OFF. Weird. Jesse waits a couple beats.
Presses speed dial again. This time he gets that familiar
three-tone sequence, followed by the operator recording:

OPERATOR (RECORDED V.O.)
The number you have reached: One-
Four-Nine, Four-Nine-Eight-Five, in
area code Five-Zero-Five, is no
longer in service. If you feel
you've reached this recording in
error...

Jesse hangs up. A look of sadness overcomes him, as he
realizes this last reminder of Jane’s voice is now gone.

But then, his expression grows pensive. Was it just
coincidence that he happened to be calling right when the
message got disconnected? Or is this one of those signs the
rehab leader was talking about? Off Jesse, thoughtful, we:

glances briefly at the closed door of the master bedroom --
where Skyler has been holed up since last night. Considers
it a beat, then continues toward...
BREAKING BAD #303 “I.F.T." Writer's Draft 8/26/09 42.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Walter, Jr. stops at the threshold of the dining room, where
Walt is cleaning up dirty breakfast dishes. Though father
and son have already eaten, Skyler’s place setting is still
laid out and clean (Walt leaves it there, just in case she
wants to eat).

WALTER, JR.
I don’t think she’s coming out.

WALT

(beat, searching)
She will. She’s just, you know,
going through a rough patch. We
are, all of us. Obviously.

(nods, willing it so)
Everything will be back to normal.
Just... give it some time.

Serious denial. Walter, Jr. gives him a dubious look. To
Walt’s relief, a car HONK-HONKS outside.

WALTER, JR.
I gotta go.

WALT
See you at school.

Walter, Jr., heads to the front door. Walt, wheels spinning,
watches him exit. As the front door shuts...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Skyler, dressed for work, sits on the edge of the bed,
holding Holly. She hears the car door shut outside. Waits

for the sound of the motor as the car pulls away.

Thinking Walt has just left, she straps the baby in the car
seat. Exits into the hallway, ready to leave for work:

INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Skyler walks down the hall holding the car seat. She sees
something odd in front of her, and stops in her tracks.

Placed on the floor at the juncture of the living room, where
she can’t miss it on her way to the front door, there is a
familiar, large DUFFEL BAG. It is unzipped, but from that
distance, we can’t quite make out what’s inside.

Until Skyler takes a few steps closer... and we see that it’s
BRIMMING WITH CASH!

Skyler’s jaw drops. Before her, more cash than she’s ever
seen in her life -- more than she ever imagined Walt had made
cooking meth. Though her expression is not one of greed or
lust, she is astounded.

WALT
Skyler...

She looks over to Walt, who stands nearby in the living room.
Gauging her every reaction. Partly because she’s entranced

by the sight of so much cash -- but also because she now
needs to hear how her once humble schoolteacher husband can
lay claim to so much money -- she slowly steps over to the

breakfast bar and takes a seat on the nearest stool. Her
body language is clear. She is ready to listen.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Walt doesn't come too close to her, afraid it might unsettle
her and cause her to leave. Keeping his distance, he leans
against the back of the armchair in the living room (the
money framed between them in the b.g.). When he begins to
speak, he’s not the resigned Walt of yesterday. This Walt is
impassioned, sincere. Yet also nervous, for he knows that
this is his one chance to make his case.

WALT

I did a terrible thing. An illegal
thing. No one knows that better
than I do. But I did it for a good
reason. I did it for us.

(re: the money)
That right there... that’s not
about money for my medical
expenses. I grant you, I could've
taken Gretchen’s handout to cover
that. No. This is so much bigger
than that. It always was.

(beat)
I earned that money, not for
myself. But to pay college
tuitions for Walter, Jr., and for
Holly seventeen years down the
road. For health insurance for you
and the kids.

(beat)
It’s for Walter, Jr.'s physical
therapy, his SAT tutor. Money for
groceries, and for gas, and for
graduation parties.

Skyler, that money is for this roof
over your head -- the mortgage that

you’re not going to be able to
afford on a part time bookkeeper's
salary when I’m gone.

SKYLER
Walt...

He holds up his hand -- please let me finish.

WALT

I did not steal this money, it
doesn’t belong to anyone, I earned
it. What I've done to earn it, the
things I’ve had to do -- I‘ve got
to live with them. And I alone
will die with them. No one else.

(chokes back emotion)
I don‘t even expect you to love me
anymore... But, Skyler, all that
I’ve done, the sacrifices that I've
made for this family, it’s all for
nothing if you don’t accept what
I’ve earned. Please. I’m not
asking you to do it for me. But
take the money for our kids.

A emotional beat. For the first time, Skyler truly grasps
that Walt’s love for his family, his paternal desire to
provide for kin, is what drove him to break the law.

And there’s that great big gym bag of American Dream, just
sitting there. Somebody’s going to take it. Why shouldn’t
it be her kids? Have not the scions of the nation’s myriad
robber barons and rum runners and corporate criminals enjoyed
fruits of their fathers’ illegalities in sums far greater?

Walt sees his words have hit home. But also he knows that
his wife's pride alone would preclude an immediate answer.

WALT
I'll be here when you come home
from work. You can give me your
answer then.

Off Skyler, a small but distinct crack in her armor:

INT. DEA ABQ - BULLPEN - DAY

Hank stands and fixes coffee at the beverage table. This, as
he steals worried glances of Gomez through the glass of the
ASAC’s office. Inside, Gomez is giving his report of Hank's
“bust” of the two meth skells. On the bullpen floor, some
FIFTEEN or so DEA AGENTS go about their business.

A DEA AGENT happens to cross by Hank, catching him off guard:

DEA AGENT
Nice bust, man. Rock‘n’roll.

HANK
Ah, thanks. Just caught an eight-
ball. No big deal.

Hank resumes to stir and spy, until Gomez finishes. As Gomez
exits the office, we overhear the ASAC through the open door:

ASAC
Ask Schrader to step in, please.

Hank eyes Gomez -- get over here. Gomez approaches, stands
next to him at the coffee machine. As both men stand side by
side, neither one looking at the other, Gomez speaks quietly:

GOMEZ
We were hanging back. Saw a deal
go down. I stepped outside to call
it in. You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects. That’s when they
attacked you.

A beat. Hank nods, relieved. Then, before he can turn away,
Gomez inches his face closer. Looks him hard in the eyes.
Says with bridled anger, but in a cold, calm voice:
GOMEZ

What I didn’t tell him was that you

left your gun under the seat before

you went back inside.
Off Hank, knowing that Gomez knows he’s not playing with a
full deck:

sheets. She is deep in thought. ‘Trapped. Miserable.

TED BENEKE enters the break room, on his way toward the
coffee machines. As he rushes by her:

TED
Hey, Sky.

Skyler doesn’t reply. Ted (thinking nothing of it) reaches

the counter, starts to fix his coffee. Skyler looks over at
him. Stares at his back (which is turned to her) while the

stack of copies keeps running through the machine.

Then, as if without realizing it, she finds herself moving
toward him....

She stops close behind Ted. He doesn’t know she’s there
until she reaches out, touches his back. He turns,
surprised. Reads her eyes. As she slowly... gently... leans
closer... and then kisses him.

WOW! They linger a beat, lips just inches apart. Then
separate further. Both a little bewildered.

Just then, a FEMALE CO-WORKER comes in and approaches the
fridge. Like teenagers caught kissing on the couch, they
quickly quail away from each other, while the co-worker grabs
a lunch bag and drink. She leaves, without noticing a thing.

They share an anxious look -- close call! Which turns a bit
impish, as each finds humor in the other's embarrassment.
This, too, fades, into an awkward silence. Then:

SKYLER
Are your kids home?

UBLE WOW! Ted shakes his head -- nope.
Off Skyler and Ted, about to take an extra-long lunch, and an
irrevocable plunge:

his cooking outfit.

After a long, thoughtful (yet determined) beat, he grabs his
mask from the workbench, pulls it over head and into place.
Then, he steps to the alter, and commences to cook. So,
that’s what the signs told him to do.

Off Jesse, living proof that idle hands are the devil’s
playthings, we:

Skyler, in her Jeep, pulls into the driveway behind Walt‘s
Aztek. (NOTE: Louis’ car is parked on the street, where
Skyler won't necessarily notice it.)

She sits behind the wheel (Holly is in the car seat behind
her). She stares blankly at the Aztek, thinking.

Is she feeling guilty about her indiscretion with Ted earlier
in the day? Happy? Confused? Or relieved, perhaps, that
she’s at least emotionally escaped the captivity of her
unbearable marriage?

Or is she pondering her response to Walt’s pitch earlier that
morning that she accept his ill-gotten gains for the family?
That she accept him?

Finally, she climbs out of the car...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

The front door opens. Skyler enters the house with Holly in
her car seat. She is surprised to see LOUIS watching TV with

Oh, hey, Skyler. I’m, ah, cooking
dinner. Pot roast. Could ya...

He signals her -- come here. Skyler pauses, sets down the
baby in the car seat, then slowly approaches.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

She finds Walt, in perfect dad mode, chopping up vegetables
for a salad. He’s chipper. Hopeful that things are about to
take a favorable turn for him in the domestic battlefield.

He mixes the salad as he speaks, keeping his voice low, so
the boys can’t hear him from the living room over the TV:

WALT
How was your day?

SKYLER

Good.

WALT

Good. Excellent.

I hope you don’t mind. I invited
Louis to stay for dinner. You
know, to thank him for driving
Walter, Jr. to school.

(stops mixing)
We've been kind of... absent. And
Louis has really pitched in.

Skyler looks at him. Reads (correctly) the absurd timing of
Walt's dinner invitation to Louis as yet another manipulation
-- an effort to keep Skyler from skipping out on dinner and
retreating into her bedroom (as has been her habit the past
few days) to avoid his burning question about the money.

motions for Skyler to come closer.
