Deserted except for A FEW SLEEPING BUMS.

FAVOR AN APARTMENT FLAT.

INT. MARIA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

THE CAMERA ANGLES UP the body of MARIA, asleep in bed, lying on
top of her sheets. Maria, a 17 year-old Italian with bleached
blonde hair, wears an oversized t-shirt that clings to her

exquisite body.

SFX: THE BUZZING OF A CLOCK RADIO FOLLOWED BY AN HARD ROCK SONG
PLAYING FULL BLAST ON THE RADIO.

Maria slaps the buzzer off, gets out of bed and crosses to her
bedroom window.

TIRED FEMALE VOICE

(yelling, Bronx

Italian)

Maria! Turn that radio down!

Maria ignores the voice. With her back to the camera, Maria faces
the windw and pulls off her t-shirt. She turns her head to the

door.

MARIA
(yelling)
Today's the day I go to camp!

During the following dialogue, Maria crosses to her dresser and
pulls out a pair of shorts, crosses to the closet and gets a
t-shirt then checks under hthe bed for her shoes.

During all her actions, THE CAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HER, making
sure that at no time do we see Maria's chest.

MARIA (CONT'D)

(yelling)

Ma! Ya hear me? I'm goin' to
that camp today.

TIRED FEMALE VOICE

(yelling)

Yeah I heard ya. Whaddya want me to
do about it?

MARIA
Aren't ya gonna walk me to the bus
or anything?

TIRED FEMALE VOICE

(yelling)

At 6:30 in the fucken' mornin'?

Walk yourself. And turn down that noise!

TIRED MALE VOICE
(yelling)
Hey. Shuddup.

TIRED FEMALE VOICE
(yelling)
No. _You_ shuddup.

MARIA

(yelling)

You _both_ shuddup! I'm goin' to
camp, and I may never come back!

FEMALE AND MALE VOICES

(yelling in unison)

GOOD!

Maria turns angrily to the door.

As she does, we get a quick view of her bare chest. Maria's right
breast has been tattooed with the word "MILK." Her left has been

tattooed with the word "SHAKE."

MARIA
FUCK YOU!

EXT. GRIMY RESIDENTIAL STREET - EARLY MORNING

Maria, in tight shorts and a cut-off "I LOVE NEW YORK" t-shirt,
walks down the deserted street. She carries a battered duffel bag
and sleeping bag.

In the b.g. a black dump truck appears.

Maria pays no attention to it.

The dump truck, gaining speed, ROARS AHEAD. Only the outline of
the driver can be seen.

HEARING, Maria turns to look.
The truck runs over the street's curb onto the sidewalk.

MARIA
What the hell -

The truck heads straight towards Maria.

MARIA
shit!

Maria runs. The truck follows.

Maria, panicked, turns into an alley.

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Maria runs down the alley as the truck turns in and follows.
Maria runs to the end of the alley. A dead end.
Maria SCREAMS.

The truck roars at her, full speed.

NEW ANGLE

The truck smashes her into the brick wall.

EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

ANGLE ON THE DUMP TRUCK

parked on the street, lifting up a dumpster.

ANGLE ON MARIA'S BODY
in the dumpster. The body gets dumped into the trash-filled
truck.

ANGLE ON ANGELA BAKER

It has been a year since we have last seen her. Angela, now 21,
gets out of the garbage truck and runs across the street toa
city bus picking up PASSENGERS.

Dressed in jeans and a clean, new "I LOVE NEW YORK" t-shirt, she
carries a small pink suitcase and a pink sleeping bag. Her hair
has been cut and dyed blonde, similar to Maria's.

Just before she boards the bus, she turns and looks at the
garbage truck.

EXT. CAMP NEW HORIZONS - DAY

Formally known as Camp Rolling Hills. Upperstate New York.
September.

ANGLE ON TAWNY RICHARDS

a pretty woman in her mid 30's, smiling directly into the camera.
Tawny wears an expensive, coordinated outfit. She holds a
microphone with a WMGH logo.

TAWNY

Hi. I'm Tawny Richards with the
WMGH newsteam. We're at Camp New
Horizons, where an autumn retreat
called "An experiment in Sharing"
is about to begin. Let's meet the
owners of the camp, Herman and
Lilly Miranda.

NEW ANGLE

Tawny and her ASSORTED TELEVISION CREW cross to HERMAN AND LILLY
MIRANDA, who stand beneath a large banner saying "AN EXPERIMENT

IN SHARING - CAMP NEW HORIZONS." Lilly, short and somewhat plump,
is in her mid 40's. Herman, about two inches shorter than Lilly,
seems a few years older. Both wear Camp New Horizons t-shirts.
Herman also sports tight jeans, boots, and a belt with a large
Playboy insignia on the buckle. Lilly wears flowery shorts and
sandals.

On either side of Herman and Lilly stand TWO GROUPS OF TEENAGERS,
who we will meet in a moment. The first group looks very
affluent; the other group looks poor and streetwise. Angela, with
the latter group, stands a bit off to the side of them. She is
dressed as we saw her this morning.

Herman gives his best smile to Tawny as Lilly stares into the
WMGH camera.

TAWNY (CONT'D)
Herman, tell us about this
wonderfully unique program.

HERMAN

Well, Tawny, we've brung together
two specially chosen groups of
teens from all over America. One
group comes from upper class homes
while the other comes from our low
class establishments.

TAWNY

Lilly, what do you wish to
accomplish?

LILLY

In our own little way we'd like to

promote harmony, peace, love, sharing, and a
better understanding between the

rich and poor.

TAWNY
That's wonderful. Let's meet the kids.

CINDY, a beautiful 17 year-old brunetter dressed in Ralph Lauren
casual, steps forward. Her Southern accent could melt butter.

CINDY
Hi, y'all. I'm Cindy Hammersmith
from Peachtree, Georgia.

Next is GREG, a friendly-looking 17 year-old Japanese boy,
dressed in beach shorts and an Hawaiian shirt.

GREG
Greg Nakashima. Westwood,
California.
Tawny turns to JAN, an exotic-looking Hispanic 16 year-old
dressed in an expensive khaki outfit that shows off her beautiful
body.

JAN
Jan Hernandez. Palm View,
Arizona.

PETER, a pudgy black 14 year-old dressed in a Polo shirt and
plaid shorts, is next.

PETER
Peter Doyle. Houston Heights,
Texas.

Tawny turns to BOBBY, a white 15 year-old dressed in a yellow
button-down short-sleeved shirt and bright green green golf
shorts. He grins broadly.

BOBBY

Bobby Stark. Western Springs,
Illinois. Home of the Western
Springs Wildcats!

Last, but not least, is MARCIA, a pretty blonde 16 year-old
dressed in a colorful t-shirt and shorts. Her slight nervousness

makes her all the more appealing.

MARSHA
Marsha Holland. Defiance, Ohio.

Tawny crosses over to the other group.
TAWNY
And let's see who we have over

here -

She turns to ARAB a gorgeous 17 year-old Asian female wearing
black leather biker gear.

ARAB
Arab. San Francisco.

TAWNY
Do you have a last name, Arab?

Arab gives her a dark look.

ARAB
No.

Tawny doesn't push it.
TAWNY
Okay.

Tawny moves to SNOWBOY, a thin 16 year old white male wearing
torn blue jeans, a Grateful Dead t-shirt, and a "Foreign Legion"

hat. He also sports a tattoo of a skull on his bicep.

SNOWBOY
Snowboy. Chicago.

Next is ANITA, a pretty yet tough black 16 year-old dressed in
old jeans and a worn plaid workshift.

ANITA
Anita Burcham. Sawtelle Gap,

Kentucky.

Tawny turns to RIFF, a muscular black 17 year-old male dressed in
jeans and a muscle t-shirt.

RIFF
Riff. Detroit.

TONY, a handsome, well-built 17 year-old Hispanic dressed in
jeans and a white t-shirt is next.

TONY
Tony DeHerrara. East L.A.

Tawny then turns to Angela, who has been admiring Tony.

TAWNY
And what's your name, honey?

ANGELA
Maria. Maria Nicastro.

TAWNY
And where are you from, Maria?

ANGELA
All over. Right now New York.

Tawny studies Angela a moment, then turns and smiles into the
WMGH camera.

TAWNY
Wonderful. What great kids.

ANGLE ON MARCIA AND CINDY

standing next to each other.
MARCIA
(whispering)
That Tony's cute.

Cindy gives her a look.

CINDY
He's _Mexican_.

Marcia tries not to react to Cindy's comment.
ANGLE ON TAWNY

She suddenly becomes quite serious as she looks into the WMGH
camera.

TAWNY

Ironically, Camp New Horizons was
formerly known as Camp Rolling
Hills, where last year nineteen
people were brutally slain by
alleged psychopath Angela Baker.
Baker, known as the "Angel of
Death," was also allegedly
responsible for another string of
grisly murders seven years ago at
nearby Camp Arawak, which has
since closed down.

Lilly pops her head in.

LILLY
But things have changed here!
We're under new ownership!

Tawny throws Lilly a look, then turns to her crew.

TAWNY
Stop tape. We're outta here.

Tawny crosses over to the SOUND MAN and gives him the microphone.
Lilly, worried, follows behind her.

LILLY
I thought we agreed you wouldn't
talk about those murders.

TAWNY

You gotta give the people what
they want. Violence sells.

(to the crew)

See you Monday morning, boys.
Turning, she spots Angela.
TAWNY
You look a little older than the

others.

ANGELA
Massive drugs.

Tawny looks around a moment to make sure no one is listening.
TAWNY (CONT'D)

(whispering)

Speaking of - do you know where I

could get some coke? I need about

a half a gram. It's been a shit of a

day - know what I mean?

Angela reacts. Then:

ANGELA (CONT'D)
I'll be right back.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY
ANGLE ON A KITCHEN DRAWER BEING PULLED OPEN.

Inside is a box of plastic sandwhich bags alongside rolls of
aluminum foil and plastic wrap.

Angela's hand snatches a baggie.
INT. DINING HALL BATHROOM - DAY
ANGLE ON GENERIC TOILET BOWL CLEANER

on a wooden shelf filled with other bathroom products. Angela's
hand grabs the cleaner.

NEW ANGLE

as Angela pours some of the cleaner into the baggie.
ANGELA

One of the many dangers of being a

drug addict is never really

knowing if the stuff is pure.

EXT. CAMP NEW HORIZONS - DAY

Angela and Tawny stand near to Tawny's porsche. Angela holds up
the filled baggie. Tawny, nervous, quickly grabs it.
TAWNY (CONT'D)
This is way too much.

ANGELA
It's a gift. You're my favorite newscaster.

TAWNY
Good stuff?

ANGELA

(nodding)

It'll really clean your pipes.
Tawny climbs into the Porsche.
TAWNY

(sarcastically)

Happy camping!

ANGELA
Thanks. Have a good life.

The Porsche ROARS TO LIFE.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

(under her breath)

What's left of it.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

ANGLE ON TAWNY'S PORSCHE

speeding down the road.

ANGLE ON TAWNY

looking into the rear-view mirror. She smiles. No one around.
ANGLE ON THE PORSCHE

as it turns on to an unpaved forest road.

ANGLE ON TAWNY

as she parks the car several yeards from the main road. She dumps
the contents of the baggie into a large pile on her dashboard.

She then takes a small straw out of her coat pocket.

TAWNY
Ready or not, here I come!

She lets out a deep breath, positions the straw, and snorts the
majority of the white powder up her nose.
Tawny instantly reacts.

She coughs. Gags.

Tries to blow it out of her nose. The only thing that comes out
is blood.

Tawny opens her mouth. A bubbling, bloody substance eats away at
it. She leans over the side of the car and retches. Then vomits a
massive ammount of blood, parts of her esophagus and stomach
lining.

But it's soon over.

Slumping over the side of the Porsche, she dies.

EXT. DINING HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON ANGELA

SCREAMING.

NEW ANGLE

A string of firecrackers EXPLODES at her feet.

She looks up to see Peter watching and GIGGLING as he runs inside
the dining hall, dodging the other campers who file inside.

HERMAN

(to Angela)

It's just a firecracker.
(laughing)

You city brats should be used to
things like that!

Angela tries to calm down.

INT. DINING HALL - DAY

The dining hall, like the rest of the camp, seems neglected.
Several of the folding chairs are stacked against the wall. Some
of the tables have also been stacked up. The bare walls and dusty

windows add to the gloom.

Lilly GREETS the campers as they enter AND ASKS THEM TO TAKE A
SEAT. Almost everyone takes a table for themselves.

Marsha approaches Tony's table.

MARCIA
Can I sit here?
TONY
It's not my table.

Marsha smiles and sits down a few seats away from Tony. Tony
studies her a moment, then turns away.

Bobby crosses to a table occupied by Arab. He gives her a toothy
grin. She ignores him.

BOBBY
Hi! Bobby Stark. Mind if I sit

with you?

ARAB
Drop dead, fag.

Bobby crosses to a table occupied by Riff. Next to Riff a ghetto
blaster PLAYS A RAP SONG.

BOBBY
Hi! Bobby Stark.

Bobby points to a nearby seat.

BOBBY (CONT'D)
This seat taken?

Riff pulls out a switchblade, pops it open and flings it.
INSERT: THE KNIFE

imbedding itself in the middle of the seat.

ANGLE ON BOBBY

smiling and backing away.

BOBBY
Cool, man. No sweat, man.

Bobby crosses to Angela's table.
BOBBY (CONT'D)

Hi. Bobby Stark. Want some
company?

Angela smiles.

ANGELA
Sure.

BOBBY
(a little surprised)
Cool.

He sits down.

BOBBY (CONT'D)
Your name's Maria Nicastro, right?

ANGELA
How'd you remember?

BOBBY
I'm great with names.
That's how I got to be Senior Class

President of my high school!

ANGELA
That's nice.

Bobby gives her another of his famous grins.

BOBBY
So you're underprivileged, huh?

Angela reacts.

ANGLE ON LILLY

CLAPPING HER HANDS to get everyone's attention.

LILLY

Okay, everybody! It's time to get

started!

She turns to Riff and points to his portable beat box.
LILLY (CONT'D)

Do you think you could turn that

off?

Riff gives her an icy stare.

LILLY (CONT'D)
Please?

Riff stares a moment longer, then TURNS OFF THE MUSIC.

LILLY (CONT'D)

Thanks. Herman's going to hand
out camp t-shirts for everyone to
wear. That way we'll all look the
same and we won't feel different.
Action lets out a small LAUGH. Herman starts handing out the
shirts.

LILLY (CONT'D)

As soon as out third counselor
arrives, we'll be splitting up
into three groups. Then we'll
stay in the groups for three days.
During that time each group will
be camping out in the woods. And
we'll get to know and understan
each other as best we can.

Cindy raises her hand.

CINDY
Excuse me!

LILLY
Yes, Cindy?

CINDY
What do y'all mean by campin' out?

LILLY
You know. Sleeping in tents,
cooking our own food, hiking -

CINDY
Where do we go to the bathroom and
take showers?

LILLY

There's outdoor toilets near our
camping sites. And we'll be
washing up in the lake.

CINDY
You're kiddin.'

HERMAN
No. We ain't.

RIFF
What kinda food we gonna have?

LILLY
Fish, mostly. We'll be catching them.

Several of the kids react.

LILLY
Fish are good for you. Besides,
we've got to watch our budget.
After you've spent three days in
the small groups, we'll come back
together for the last two. Any
other questions?

SNOWBOY
Yeah. Do the guys get to sleep
with the girls?

LILLY
(laughing)
No.

SNOWBOY
Why not?

LILLY
Because. You know.

SNOWBOY
No. I don't. Tell me.

ARAB
They're afraid we'll _fuck_.

Lilly decides it's time to change the subject.
LILLY (CONT'D)

Why don't we all loosen up with a

good, old fashioned camp song.

Does anyone know "The Happy

Camper" song?

Angela raises her hand, excited.

ANGELA
I do!

Most of the campers turn and react.
SFX: A CAR DRIVING UP O.S.

LILLY
That must be Barney.

ARAB
(laughing)
_Barney_?

TONY
Barney Rubble.
Everyone LAUGHS.

EXT. DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS

An old model Mustang, driven by BARNEY WHITMORE, pulls up and
parks next to Herman and Lilly's Jeep. In his early 40's,
Barney is a handsome, solidly built man. He wears jeans and a

polo shirt.

Barney exits the car and crosses to the dining hall entrance.

INT. DINING HALL - DAY

Barney enters.

LILLY

Everybody - I'd like you to meet
our third counselor, Officer
Barney Whitmore.

Barney nods hello to the campers. Snowboy slumps.

him. Arab and Riff sneer.

ANGLE ON ANGELA

looking at Barney.

She is not happy.

NEW ANGLE

BARNEY

Sorry I'm late. I guess I'll have
to catch up on all your names

later.

CINDY
Are you a cop?

BARNEY
Yep.

Riff BELCHES. Barney ignores him.
BARNEY

That's one of the reasons I'm
here. To make sure there's no
trouble.

RIFF BELCHES AGAIN. LOUDER.

Arab and Snowboy LAUGH.

Tony studies
TONY
(to Riff)
Hey. You got a problem?

Riff turns to him.

Pause.

RIFF
Suck my dick, spic.

NEW ANGLE

Tony jumps from the table and quickly flattens Riff on the
ground, sending chairs flying along the way.

Riff yanks out his switchblade. It flies open in Tony's face.

RIFF
You're dead, spic.

An arm suddenly wraps around Riff's neck, as a hand swiftly
twists Riff's hand with the knife, forcing him to drop it.

NEW ANGLE

as Barney, with a chokehold on Riff, slams Riff into a table.

BARNEY

Any more shit like this and I'll
send your butt to jail so fast you
won't know what happened. You got
it?

Riff nods. Barney releases his hold on Riff, then picks up the
switchblade. He closes it and pockets it.

BARNEY (CONT'D)

(to the grouo)

Anybody else carrying anything?
Give it to me now. Cause the same
goes for you that goes for him.
(to Riff)

Sit down and behave yourself.

Riff obeys.
ANGLE ON ANGELA AND BOBBY
BOBBY

(whispering)
This is better than t.v.!
On Angela's reaction:

EST. SHOT: EXT. CABIN - AFTERNOON

Angela's cabin from last year. Lilly, with her clipboard,
stands in front. She checks her watch.

LILLY

(shouting)

Hurry up, girls! We've got a lot
to do!

INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE ON CINDY

in a fashionable satin bra and panties, as she crosses to the
bathroom carrying a makeup case. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER until
Han, nude from the waist up, exits the bathroom and passes by
Cindy.

THE CAMERA THEN FOLLOWS JAN to a bed, where she picks up a Camp
New Horizons t-shirt. In the b.g. Anita, in a simple cotton
bra, changes into her camp t-shirt.

ARAB (0.S.)
(to Jan)
Gimme a shirt, will ya?

Jan grabs another t-shirt on the bed and crosses to Arab,
WITH THE CAMERA FOLLOWING. As Jan reaches Arab, Arab peels
off her black t-shirt. She is nude underneath.

Angela, still wearing her "I LOVE NEW YORK" t-shirt, sits

on a bed directly in back of Arab and Jan. She glances up at the
two pairs of breasts in front of her face, then quickly looks
back down to the floor.

Angela takes off her "I LOVE NEW YORK" t-shirt, revealing a
very heavy, ultra-conservative white cotton bra.

ARAB

(noticing)

How do ya get _that_ thing off?
With a can opener?

Angela quickly slips on her camp t-shirt as Arab and Jan
LAUGH.

MARSHA (0.S.)
Hey - look at this.

ANGLE ON MARCIA
in her camp t-shirt, as she walks into the empty counselor's
room. Scrawled on the walls are "ANGELA BAKER = THE

_DEVIL_ OF DEATH," "ANGELA - GO TO HELL," "THE KILLER COUNSELOR
SLEPT HERE," "THE ANGEL OF DEATH MUST DIE," and "FUCK ANGELA
BAKER." Also on the walls are crude pictures of Angela
supposedly killing people. Marcia is disgusted and a little
firghtened by what she sees.

MARSHA (CONT'D)
How weird. It's that girl who
killed everybody. Angela Baker.

Anita, Jan and Arab, dressed in their t-shirts, enter. Their
reactions are similar to Marcia's.

ANGLE ON ANGELA

as she listens. Cindy, still in her panties and bra, rushes by
to join the other girls.

CINDY (0.S.)
Yuck! These drawings are so
gross!

ANITA (0.S.
They should've told us about this.

ARAB (0.S.)

You think anybody could come here
if they did? Shit, you're dumber
than you look.

ANGLE ON ARAB

turning to Cindy.

ARAB (CONT'D)
How much did they charge _you_ to
come here, rich girl?

CINDY
I dunno. Three thousand bucks I
think.

ARAB

God. I bet the fucking government
paid 'em at least that much for
us. "An experiment in Sharing,"
my ass. We're here cause they
can't get anybody else.

ANGLE ON ANGELA
listening.

ARAB (CONT'D, 0.S.)

And we've got some crazy asshole
named Angela Baker to thank for
it.

Angela flashes Arab an angry look.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CABIN - AFTERNOON

Angela, in camp t-shirt, exits the cabin to see Barney at the
bottom of the stairs checking Arab's driver's license.
Angela tries to sneak by.

BARNEY
(to Angela)
Hold it. I need to see some i.d.

Angela looks at him a moment. Then reaches into her pocket and
pulls out a driver's license.

Arab exits as Barney takes Angela's license.

HIS P.O.V.: A NEW YORK DRIVER'S LICENSE

saying "Maria Nicastro" with Angela's picture. The birthday
reads "July 28, 1972." The hair reads "blonde."

BARNEY

No offense, but you look like
you've been through a lot in 17
years.

ANGELA
I have.

BARNEY
I hope you have a good time here,
Maria.

ANGELA
Thanks.

He gives her back the license. Lilly crosses to Barney with a
xeroxed map.

LILLY
(to Barney)
Here's your map.
Angela crosses to the other kids. All have changed into Camp
New Horizons t-shirts, although Riff has rolled his sleeves up
to accentuate his muscles and Cindy has tied the bottom of her
t-shirt to make it look more cute. In the b.g. Herman sorts
various camping equipment into three different piles.

Lilly turns to the campers.

LILLY (CONT'D)

Now pay attention!

When you hear your name,

go stand next to your counselor.

She looks down at her clipboard.

LILLY (CONT'D)
Arab, Bobby, Riff and Cindy will
be with me.

Lilly's group isn't very excited about Lilly or each other.
They reluctantly cross her.

LILLY (CONT'D)
Peter, Jan, Maria and Snowboy will be
with Herman.

Peter, Snowboy and Jan start crossing to Herman. Angela stays
with the others.

LILLY (CONT'D)
Maria -

Angela, realizing Lilly is talking to her, crosses to her
group. In the b.g. Herman points his Playboy buckle in Jan's
direction and scams her.

LILLY (CONT'D)
That leaves Marsha, Tony, Anita
and Greg with Barney.

Marsha grins at Tony, who grins shyly back. Angela notices.
She can't help but feel a little jealous. Tony's cute.

LILLY (CONT'D)

I hope everybody learns a lot in
the next three days. And when we
come back together, I gaurantee it
won't be the same.

ANGLE ON ANGELA

reacting.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GROUP THREE CAMPSITE - AFTERNOON

the clearing. Each carry their backpack and sleeping bags.
Marsha and Tony also carry an ice chest between them while
Anita and Greg carry the tent supplies and fishing poles.
Barney carries a large box full of various camping items.

BARNEY
Here we are.

GREG
Home sweet home!

BARNEY
Why don't we put everything down
and rest a second.

The campers, grateful for the break, quickly drop everything
and sit down.

MARSHA
I thought we'd never make it.

ANITA
It wasn't so bad. Back home we've
got hills like this all over.

GREG
So do we. The Hollywood Hills.
Right, Tony?

TONY
I guess.

BARNEY
Who's hungry?

Everyone but Tony AD LIBS that they are.

BARNEY (CONT'D)

We're supposed to catch fish. And
we will - maybe tommorow. But I
thought you might enjoy something
else tonight.

He opens up the chest. It is filled with hamburger meat,
hotdogs, condiments, buns, and a variety of soda.

Everyone APPROVES.
BARNEY (CONT'D)
I know I'm bending the rules a
bit, but hey -

TONY
(deadpan)
You can do it. You're a cop.

Silence. An uncomfortable moment.

BARNEY

I'm doing it because

when I had the chance to

do it with my own son, I didn't.

GREG
How old is he?

BARNEY
Sean would have been seventeen.
he was murdered here last year.

GREG
God. I'm sorry.

BARNEY
You didn't know.

Pause.

TONY
And I'm sorry for giving you a
hard time.

BARNEY
It's okay. I'm used to it. I
cop, remember?

ma

Everyone LAUGHS.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Who wants a soda?

THEY ALL AD LIB THAT THEY DO.

Barney tosses sodas to his campers.

EXT. HERMAN'S CAMPSITE - AFTERNOON

ANGLE ON A DOUBLE-EDGED AX BLADE

Slicing through the air...
And landing on a log, chopping the log in two.
ANGLE ON ANGELA

with an ax. Beside her are several other pieces of chopped
wood. In the b.g. Peter sits by the tents, sorting his
firecrackers.

Angela picks up a piece of wood and carries it over to a fire
being startled by Herman. Jan stands nearby with a handful of
kindling.

HERMAN
(to Angela)
Where'd you learn to chop wood?

ANGELA
I've never chopped wood before.
But I've chopped other things.

JAN
Let me know when you want these

sticks, Mr. Miranda.

HERMAN
Anytime now, sweatpea.

Herman gives her a fond pat on the rear as he gets up.

HERMAN (CONT'D)
And call me Herman.

Herman turns to Snowboy and Peter.

HERMAN (CONT'D)
Where's Snowboy?

PETER
I dunno.

HERMAN
(shouting)
Snowboy!

EXT. - WOODS BY HERMAN'S CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS
Snowboy, spray-painting his gang's logo on a tree with a small
can

of red spraypaint, turns.

SNOWBOY
(shouting)
Yeah?

HERMAN (0.S.)

(shouting)

Time to go fishing!

Snowboy stuffs the can down the front of his jeans.
EXT. - HERMAN'S CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS

Snowboy enters from the woods.

JAN

(to Herman)

Do we have to?

HERMAN
We gotta eat, don't we?

JAN
I hate fish.

Herman playfully touches her nose.

HERMAN
Hey, that's no way to talk.

Jan, pouting, crosses and exits into a tent.
Herman turns to the other three.

HERMAN (CONT'D)

You guys each grab a pole and some

Here.

Without any hesitation, she takes the worm and deftly spikes it
on the hook.

tomorrow.

Peter throws the fish head at Angela.

ANGELA (CONT'D)
You brat.

Peter gives Angela the finger, then runs into the woods.

bag.

She grabs the stick and holds it over the ever-increasing flames.
EXT. LILLY'S CAMPSITE - MORNING SCENE 32*

Lilly's campsite is the former location of the abandoned cabin
where Angela stored several campers' bodies during last year's
reign of terror.

Now only a pile of boards remain where the cabin used to stand.
The outhouse trench has been filled in. The only recognizable
fixture from the area is the old barbecue pit, which remains
intact.

Lilly and her campers sit around the barbecue pit, silently
eating a breakfast that looks something like mush.

They look up to see Angela enter. Angela carries her suitcase,
sleeping bag and Berman's map. Her camp t-shirt is somewhat
wrinkled, but clean.

LILLY
What are you doing here?

ANGELA

I'm supposed to switch with
someone from this group. Herman
said so.

LILLY

(a little miffed)

I wish he wouldn't do things like
that.

supposed to switch with?

Angela throws Arab a look.

Angela leads the way through the woods as Arab, with her gear,
follows sullenly behind her.

ARAB
How old are you, anyway?

ANGELA

I know. When I was young, our
town's water supply didn't have
any fluoride.

ARAB
You're one weird motherfucker.

EXT. HERMAN'S CAMPSITE - DAY SCENE 34

Angela and Arab enter from the woods. With the exception of only
one tent and no campers in sight, everything seems normal.

ARAB
Where's the other tent?

ANGELA
It got sort of wrecked. We're all
in one now.

ARAB
All right!

gives her a quick cool smile that basically says "You are shit."
Riff gives her a "You are shit" frown.

LILLY (CONT'D)

I call this our "Sharing and
Caring" time. For instance,

what's your favorite movie?

ANGELA
"ELT."

LILLY
How nice. How about- you, Riff?

RIFF
Ones with tits and blood.

CINDY

(to Riff)

Why do we have to listen to
those stupid rap tapes? I mean,
who likes that stuff anymore?

RIFF
Fuck you.

LILLY
Now, Riff -

RIFF

(interrupting)

Rap is a helluva lot better than
that country shit.

CINDY

I never said I liked country. But
I'd rather listen to that than a
bunch of darkies who can't sing.

Riff spits in her face.

LILLY
Riff!

Cindy, shocked and angry, wipes off the spit. Then looks at him
with undisguised hatred.
CINDY
You dirty nigger.

Riff jumps up and starts strangling Cindy.

LILLY
Riff! Stop it! Stop it right now
or I'll get Officer Whitmore!

Riff lets go. Cindy, crying, runs into her tent. Everyone is

We see that everyone is busy cleaning. Tony scrubs the grill
while Greg, using a plastic tub, washes various cooking utensils.
Greg hands the utensils to Marsha, who rinses them in a similar
tub. Marsha then hands the clean utensils to Anita, who dries
them. Barney in the b.g. picks up a pile of wood, crosses to the
campers and sets it down.

MARSHA

I think Tony scared the raccoon
half to death!

Come on. Scream again! I want to
hear it!

Tony turns toward Barney.

TONY

(mock angry)

Barney, this rich white girl keeps

giving me a hard timel

BARNEY
Oh, poor babyl

Everyone LAUGHS.

ANITA
(to Barney)

I hate to bring this up. But what
do you think happened to that
Angela Baker?

BARNEY

Nobody knows. There's no pictures
of her since 7 years ago. Plus
when she was 18 her juvenile
records were destroyed. All we
can go on are descriptions.

GREG

But she was a counselor here last
year. Didn't anyone take her
picture?

BARNEY
Nope. Supposedly nobody wanted
to. She wasn't very popular.

MARSHA
What does she look like?

BARNEY
She's white. About 5 foot 7,
115 pounds. Brown eyes. Reddish

brown hair. Twenty-one years old.

We're going to do a trust game
right now. Let's break up
into pairs.

Cindy glares at Riff, then turns to Angela. Riff gives Cindy an
attitude and turns to Bobby. Bobby gives it his best shot.

BOBBY
(to Riff)
Looks like we're partners.

RIFF
Shut up.

BOBBY
Cool, man. Right on.

Lilly hands two strips of cloth each to Cindy and Bobby.

LILLY (CONT'D)

One of you will be blindfolded and
have your hands tied behind your
back. Your partner will then lead
you around. After fifteen minutes
or so, you'll switch.

CINDY

Oh, this'll be fun.
(to Angela)

You can go first.

EXT. WOODS - DAY SCENE 42

Angela, blindfolded, gets led through the woods by Cindy. Cindy
pays little attention to her.

CINDY
How you doin', honey?

ANGELA
Okay.

CINDY
Good. I wish I could say the
same. That nigger could've killed me.

She shudders.

CINDY (CONT'D)

I bet he would've liked that, too.
He could brag to all his
â€œ"homeboys" how he massacred some
rich white girl. Those street
gangs do that, you know.

Cindy LAUGHS and stops. Angela keeps walking, unaware that Cindy
has stopped.

Angela bumps into a tree. Cindy LAUGHS and catches up to her.
CINDY (CONT'D)

Be a good girl, and

just stay there a second. I'll be

right back.

Cindy walks several feet away.

ANGELA
Hey -

ANGELA
(yelling)
Something was crawling on me!

The rabbit has long since disappeared.

CINDY
I don't see anything.
ANGELA
Get this blindfold off!

Cindy, laughing to herself, removes the blindfold. Angela's eyes
get used to the light as Cindy unties her wrists.

CINDY

used to the country.

Angela gives Cindy one of her famous looks.

Hey -

NEW ANGLE

Angela begins hoisting Cindy up the flagpole.

CINDY (CONT'D)
WHAT'S GOIN' ON? LET ME DOWN

Angela, ignoring her, turns Cindy around so Cindy's head faces
the ground. Angela then reaches up and wraps the rope around one

of Cindy's legs.

CINDY (CONT'D)
STOP IT! I'LL SUE YOU FOR
EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT!

Angela starts hoisting her up again.

CINDY (CONT'D)
STOP IT!! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
TO ME??!

Angela hoists her to the top of the flagpole.

ANGELA

Because you're a cheerleader, a
fornicator, a drug-taker, and a
nasty, snotty bigot. Besides
that, you're real nice.

Angela lets go of the rope. Cindy drops to the bottom.

Her head SMASHES into the cement surrounding the flagpole.

EXT. LILLY'S CAMPSITE - DAY SCENE 44

Lilly cooks a larger juicy steak as Angela enters.

LILLY
Where's Cindy?

LILLY

Why don't you be a dear and get

that sack of garbage by my tent.
There's a place to dump it behind
the dining hall.

Ancela crosses to the garbage and picks it up.

LILLY

Oh - I'm just about out of tanning
lotion. There's some in the pantry
right next to the kitchen. The
front door should be open.

ANGELA
Did there used to be a cabin up
here?

LILLY
Yes. Right over there.
She points to the pile of boards.
ANGELA

Was that the cabin where all those
bodies were found last year?
LILLY

(surprised)

How'd you know about that?

ANGELA
I guess I read about it.

LILLY

Well, don't tell the others. They

Angela passes by a shelf containing old sports equipment and life
preservers. Much of the equipment is damaged.

Angela spots a bottle of sun tan lotion next to a cassette tape
recorder in the "lost and found" section. Next to the tape
recorder is a microphone and several tapes.

Angela picks up the lotion, then wipes her finger across the top
of the tape recorder. Angela looks at her finger. It's covered
with dirt and dust.

A COCKROACH runs past hez hand.
Angela SCREAMS and jumps back. She quickly crosses back to the

I'm going to be tying you two together.
You'll have to coordinate your walking,
your hand movements, everything.

Lilly starts tying the wrists of their inner hands together as
she turns to Riff.

LILLY (CONT'D)
Riff, since Cindy isn't feeling
well, I think you and I will have

to be partners.

RIFF
No fucken way.

Lilly lets it pass. Never argue with a juvenile delinquent.

ANGELA
How long do we have to do this?

LILLY

Until you've caught enough fish
for lunch and dinner. It'll test
how well you can work together.

ANGELA
What?

BOBBY
I like being tied up. Especially
next to you. It turns me on.

Angela tries not to look nauseated.

Just as she is about to say something, Bobby attacks her, wildly
kissing her and fondling her breasts with his free hand.

Angela drops the pole and slaps Bobby hard.

ANGELA
STOP IT!

BOBBY
But I thought you wanted it. Your
type always do.

ANGELA
No!

Pause.

ANGELA
At least not now.

She smiles.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

Meet me by the dining hall right
after dark.

Bobby grins.

BOBBY

But how will we get away from

Lilly?

ANGELA
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

EXT. LILLY'S CAMPSITE - DAY SCENE 57

ANGLE ON LILLY
lying on the recliner - eyes closed, sunning herself.
A string of fish are shoved in front of her face.
She frowns, then opens her eyes.

NEW ANGLE

Angela, still tied to Bobby, holds the fish.

LILLY

Good job!

(beat)

Why don't you put them down?

Angela complies. Lilly gets out of her chair and begins to untie
them.

Lilly turns to a tent occupied by Riff. As dsual, his RAP MUSIC
blares in the b.g.

LILLY (CONT'D)

Riff! Since Maria and Bobby
caught the fish, I think you
should clean them.

No answer. Lilly turns back to Angela and Bobby.

LILLY (CONT'D)
Bobby, maybe you should clean
them.

BOBBY
But that's not fair. He doesn't
do anything.

ANGELA
Let me talk to him.

She crosses to the tent and opens the flap. Riff, hands behind
his head, lies on his sleeping bag.

ANGELA (CONT'D)
Hi.

Riff doesn't answer.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

We just spent two hours catching
fish. It's only fair that you

clean them.

RTFF TURNS UP HIS MUSIC FULL BLAST.
ANGELA (CONT'D)
Please turn that down.

RIFF
What?

ANGELA (shouting)
I said turn down your music.

RIFF
What?

ANGELA
(shouting)

You heard me the first time!

Riff looks at her a moment. Turns down his music. Then pulls a
pistol from behind his head and points it at her.

Angela turns to Bobby.

ANGELA (CONT'D)
Clean the fish, Bobby.

EXT. WOODS - DAY SCENE 58

Marsha her hands tied and her eyes blindfolded, is led by Tony
through the woods.

MARSHA
This is easy. Make it harder.

TONY
Okay.

He grabs her shoulders and starts leading her around, almost
bumping her into several trees. She loves it. Tony then starts

spinning her around.

MARSHA
Stop it! I'm getting dizzy!

Tony stops. Marsha wobbles to the ground. He sits next to her.

MARSHA
It's your turn.

TONY
Huh uh.

MARSHA
I'll tell!
TONY
Geez. I'm scared.

He unties her, and takes off her blindfold.

TONY (CONT'D)
So what's it like where you live?

AS MARSHA STARTS TO SPEAK, Tony playfully interrupts.

TONY

No. Don't tell me. You go toa
little red brick school. And
you're in the choir.

MARSHA
It's orange brick. And I'm in the
band.

TONY

Same difference. You've got
really nice parents. And your
town has a park where every Fourth
of July there's fireworks. Plus
at Christmas there's a big parade
when Santa Claus arrives. Am I
right?

MARSHA
Don't make fun of me!

TONY
And what have you been doing to me
this whole weekend?

MARSHA LAUGHS.

MARSHA
Are you in a gang?

TONY
Yeah. Where I'm from, everybody
is.

MARSHA
What's it like?

TONY

You don't want to hear about it.
I wish I could get out. But the
only way to do that is to move.
MARSHA
Why don't you?

TONY
Maybe I will. I'll come live with
you. In Idaho.

MARSHA
Ohio.

TONY AND MARSHA
(in unison)
Same difference.

Pause.

TONY (CONT'D)
Are you scared of me?

MARSHA
No. But I was.

TONY
You're very pretty.

MARSHA

(softly)

Thanks.

They look at each other.

Smile.

TONY
Can I kiss you?

She nods.

He kisses her tentatively. Then tenderly.

Marsha pushes away.

TONY (CONT'D)
What's wrong?

MARSHA
Nothing.

Marsha fishes into her pants pocket.
MARSHA (CONT'D)

If we're gonna make love, you've
gotta wear one of these.
She pulls out a wrapped condom.

Tony reacts. Then:

TONY
I'm moving to Ohio!

MARSHA LAUGHS, then they continue where they left off.

ANGELA

Lilly-

Let's do the blindfold game

together.

Lilly frowns.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

Please? I'll lead you back to

camp. That way you can check up

on Cindy.

Lilly puts down her magazine.

LILLY

Why not? I was getting a

little worried about her anyway.

Let me get a couple strips of cloth.

Angela produces two strips of cloth from behind her back.

Angela leads the blindfolded and tied Lilly.

As they talk, Angela leads Lilly in the direction of the garbage
trench behind the dining hall.

ANGELA
Are you planning a trip soon?

LILLY

Yes. Herman and I are going to Europe.
It'll be very expensive, but like
Herman says, "we're worth it."

ANGELA
You have cockroaches in the
pantry. And I think I sawa
mouse.

LILLY
Really? We'll have to do
something about that.

ANGELA
Why do you bury your trash?

LILLY
Because garbage companies charge
an arm and a leg.

ANGELA
They're not that expensive.

LILLY

Every penny counts. It hasn't
been easy taking this place over,
let me tell you. Nobody wants to
go to a camp where everyone's been
slaughtered.

They arrive at the garbage pit, with Lilly directly in front of
it.

ANGELA
Have you ordered your tickets to
Europe yet?

LILLY
No.

ANGELA
Good. Your trip's been canceled.
Angela shoves Lilly into the pit. Only Lilly's head is above the
ground.

Angela crosses to the shovel as Lilly struggles to get out..

LILLY

WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET ME OUT OF
HERE! THERE'S RATS DOWN HERE!
THEY'LL EAT ME ALIVE!

ANGELA
No they won't. They'll be suffocated
soon.

VARIOUS ANGLES

Angela, ignoring LILLY'S SCREAMS, SINGS while burying Lilly up to
her head.

ANGELA

Oh, I'm a Happy Camper!

I love the summer sun,

I love the trees and forests,
I'm always having fun!

Oh, I'm a Happy Camper!

I love the clear blue sky,
And with the Grace of God,
I'll camp until I die!

Lilly, except for her head, is completely buried.

ANGELA (CONT'D)
Goodbye, Lilly.

She begins to exit.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

By the way, your husband fools

around.

Lilly, confused and frightened, yells at the exiting Angela.
LILLY

back! You're in big trouble

No answer.

Guess who?

ANGELA
Bobby.

NEW ANGLE

Angela sits under a tree. Bobby takes his hands away from her
face. He looks freshly groomed.

BOBBY
Yeah. How'd you know?

He kisses her on the head. Angela gets up.

Angela points to the tree.

ANGELA (CONT'D)
Stand in front of the tree.

Be does. On the cround next to the tree are two pieces of rope.
One is about three feet long. The other rope is wound in a coil,

with one end trailing away from the tree.

Angela takes the short piece of rope and ties Bobby's feet
against the tree.

ANGELA (CONT'D)
So you like to be tied up, huh?

Bobby blushes.

BOBBY
Yeah. But don't tell anybody,
okay? If the wrong person found
out, I could lose an election
someday.

ANGELA
My lips are sealed. Put your
hands behind the tree.

BOBBY
Shouldn't I take my clothes off
first?

ANGELA
No. It's more fun like this.

He complies. Angela takes the end of the coiled rope and ties his
hands behind the tree.

BOBBY

Wow. This is like something in a
dirty magazine. Wouldn't that be
cool? Reading about this?

ANGELA
It's more fun to live it.

BOBBY
Yeah.

He closes his eyes.

ANGLE ON BOBBY

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I really appreciate this. It's
not like I don't respect you or
anything. I do. I think you're
really a neat person.

He opens his eyes.

BOBBY (CONT'D)
When do we screw?

NEW ANGLE

Bobby looks around. No Angela. Turning around, he sees that
Angela is about to enter Herman and Lilly's Jeep parked nearby.

BOBBY (CONT'D)
Whaddya doing?
ANGELA

(as she climbs in)

Thank the Lord there will be one

less idiot in politics.

SHE GUNS THE MOTOR.

VARIOUS ANGLES

Angela speeds away in the Jeep. As she does, we see that rope is
tied to the Jeep's hitch. The very same rope that leads to the

coil ... and to Bobby.

BOBBY
Hey -

The coil of rope quickly starts unraveling. Bobby notices.

BOBBY (CONT'D)
NOI!!!

Bobby tries to quickly untie himself.

But it's no use. The coil of rope soon disappears.

Hello.

Ignoring him, Angela crosses to Barney, who plays frisbee with
Greg and Anita. Tony and Marsha curious, get up and follow
behind.

this group. I'm supposed to
switch. With Marsha.

THE CAMPERS VOICE THEIR SURPRISE AND DISAPPOINTMENT.

EXT. WOODS - DAY SCENE 66

Angela silently leads the way as Barney and Marsha walk behind
her. They walk down a very narrow path next to the edge of a
hill.

MARSHA
Our group was so good, too.

BARNEY

Maybe, if I talk with Herman, you

can stay. But it's not my camp, so
we've got to do what he wants. Besides,
we're all getting together tomorrow
anyway .

MARSHA
I know. But even so. Tonight was
going to be special.
BARNEY
With us? Or with Tony?

Marsha, embarrassed, LAUGHS.
Angela, jealous and angry, turns and looks at Marsha.
Marhsa looks at her and smiles. Then notices:

MARSHA
Maria, look out -

Too late.

Anaela trips over a root in the path. Marsha rushes over to her
side.

Are you all right?

Angela tries not to cry.

ANGELA
It hurts.

Marsha, concerned, turns toward Barney.

ANGELA
What a surprise.

Barney starts bandaging the ankle.

BARNEY

It's not too bad. You'll just
have to stay off of it as much as
possible.

Marsha strokes Anaela's hair.

MARSHA
Feel better?

ANGELA
Yeah. Thanks a lot. I mean it.

Marsha smiles. Maria's a little strange. But she's okay.

BARNEY
I'd better go find Herman.

ANGELA
How well do you know him?

BARNEY
Not very well.

ANGELA
Good. Cause he's a terrible
counselor. So's Lilly.

BARNEY
They're not so bad.

ANGELA

They eat steak while we eat fish. He
fornicates with the campers. And
Lilly's so lazy, she doesn't do
anything. Just sits all day and
sunbathes.

BARNEY
How do you know?

ANGELA
I have eyes.
Beat.

BARNEY (CONT'D)

Did Herman really want Marsha to
switch with you, or did you just
make that up?

Pause.

ANGELA
I made it up. I want to be with
you guys.

BARNEY

Sorry, Maria. We've got to stick
to the rules. You should get back
to Herman.

ANGELA
But I don't want to.

BARNEY
It's only for another day. Come
on. We'll help you walk there.

They help her off the table.

MARSHA
Does Lilly really sunbathe all
day?

ANGELA
Yeah. In fact, she's out in the
back right now.

MARSHA
Really?

ANGELA
Go look for yourself. But I'm
warning you, it's not a pretty
sight.

How many have you killed this
time?

ANGELA
I don't know. Lots. But I had no

choice. They deserved it.

You have exactly two minutes to
find out. If you try to run away,
I'll kill you. if you don't find

FADE UP:

CLOSING CREDITS AND -

RAP MUSIC.

ANGELA'S VOICE
(rapping)

Angels are pretty,
Angels can fly,

And here's an angel
That can make you die.
You've got no style,
You've got no flair,
All you do

Is fight and swear.
So say your prayers,
And make amends,
Cause your life story
Is about to end.

LOUD, FRIGHTENING MUSIC BEGINS AND CONTINUES DURING THE REMAINING
CREDITS.

FADE OUT.
