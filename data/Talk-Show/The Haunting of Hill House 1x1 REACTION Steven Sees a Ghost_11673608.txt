THE HAUNTING

SO1E01:
"Steven Sees a Ghost"

by
Mike Flanagan

02/23/17
EXT. HILL HOUSE, THEN - NIGHT

Dense, New England woods, lit only by the moonlight. The leaf-
less branches crossing our frame like skeletal hands.

STEVEN (V.0.)
No live organism can continue to
exist sanely under conditions of
absolute reality, which is why all
conscious things - man, child, and
beast - must sleep. And dream.

The camera moves beyond the trees and branches to REVEAL:

A sprawling family home in the woods, all by itself. Large,
striking, and brimming with history.

Huge windows, brick and iron, with hints of the Gothic in its
architecture. The longer one stares, the more off-kilter the
house seems to be.

All around, the signs of a RENOVATION IN PROGRESS.
Scaffolding, tools, abandoned to the late hour. Someone is
working hard on this house.

LEGEND: HILL HOUSE. THEN.

STEVEN (V.O.)
Hill House, not sane, stood by
itself against its hills, holding
darkness within. It had stood so
for a hundred years before my
family moved in, and it might stand
for a hundred more.

INT. HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS

We float through the halls. Past the grand staircase. Past
the large, ornate windows. The architecture is old, but the
dressing is clearly 1990's.

Small HOME IMPROVEMENT projects throughout the house. Fresh
paint on some elements, absent from others.

STEVEN (V.O.)
Within, walls stood upright, bricks
met neatly, floors were firm.
Silence lay steadily against the
wood and stone of Hill House...

We linger on details: CHILDREN’S TOYS, abandoned to the late
hour. Patched dry-wall, corners of the bannister in the midst
of renovation.
2.

FAMILY PHOTOS of the CRANES: HUGH (late 30’s), his wife MARY
(late 30's), and the children: STEVEN (11), SHIRLEY (9),
THEODORA (7) and the twins, LUKE and NELL (5).
STEVEN (V.O.)
.-- And whatever walked there,
walked alone.

CUT TO:

INT. STEVEN’S ROOM, HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS

A boy's room, with all the expected flourishes of the
nineties: a TV, video games. We float toward the boy, asleep
in his bed, moonlight on his face. He is YOUNG STEVEN (11).

We come to rest on Steven’s face, as he’s stirred from sleep
by a sound...

The sound of a CHILD CRYING. He blinks, sitting up.

CUT TO:

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS

He steps into the hallway, looking smaller against the sheer
size of the home. High ceilings, archways.

The crying is LOUDER now.

He sees his sister YOUNG THEO (7) standing by her door,
rubbing her eyes. The crying woke her too.

YOUNG STEVEN
It’s okay Theo, go back to bed.

YOUNG THEO
Should we wake mom and dad?

YOUNG STEVEN
I've got it.

He moves past her, toward the last door in the hall. He
pushes it open.

CUT TO:
INT. NELL’S ROOM, HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS

He moves into the room. In the soft glow of the night light,
he sees YOUNG NELL (5) perched at the foot of her bed. Crying
her little tears, clearly afraid.

YOUNG STEVEN
You okay Nellie?

She shakes her head “no.”

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
You scared?

She shakes her head “yes.”

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
That’s okay, I get scared too
sometimes.

He steps into the room, and looks over to the bed on the
other side, where Nell’s twin brother YOUNG LUKE (5) sleeps
soundly, despite his sister's cries.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
Luke sleeps through anything, huh?
What was it?
YOUNG NELL
(beat)
The bent-neck lady.

YOUNG HUGH (0.S.)
Oh, her again.

They turn. Standing in the doorway is YOUNG HUGH CRANE. In
his pajamas, eyes tired - but still managing a gentle smile.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
Where was she?

Nell POINTS to the foot of the bed, almost where her brother
is standing. Hugh smiles, stepping into the room.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
Oh boy, let’s take a look.

He moves to the spot.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
Here, huh?

She nods.
YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
Your big brother must have scared
her away. Big brothers are good
like that.

YOUNG NELL
What if she’s hiding?

YOUNG HUGH
Well let’s make sure she isn’t.
Where could she go?

Nell’s eyes go to the foot of the bed. Hugh follows her gaze,
and crouches to look underneath the bed.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
Anyone under here? You better come
out, or you’re in trouble.
(beat)
Hmmm. Not there...

He looks up at Nell, who points toward the closet.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT'D)
Ah.

Steven steps aside, watching as his dad goes through the
motions for Nell. He smiles, watching close. Learning how.

Hugh opens the closet door, moving the clothes to the side.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
You better come out, bent-neck
lady. Stop scaring Nellie.
(beat)
Nope, she’s long gone.

Nell relaxes a little.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
And now, everybody can go back to
bed.

Steven heads for the door, turning to watch his father tuck
Nell back into bed.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
There we go. Do you remember what
we talked about before? About our
dreams?

YOUNG NELL
They can spill.
YOUNG HUGH
That's right. Just like a cup of
water spills sometimes. And a kid’s
dreams are special, they’re like -

At the door, Steven smiles. He remembers this part...

YOUNG STEVEN
(very softly)
An ocean.

YOUNG NELL
An ocean.

YOUNG HUGH
That's right. Sometimes the big
dreams can spill out.
(turns )
Back to bed, Stevie.

Steve smiles, and walks away. Hugh turns back to Nell.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
I know the bent-neck lady is scary,
but that’s all she is. Just a
little spill. You know that, right
Nellie?

She stares at him.

She nods.

YOUNG NELL
How long do we have to live here,
daddy?

YOUNG HUGH

Well, I’ve got to finish fixing the
house. And then, somebody has to
buy it.

YOUNG NELL
And then we can go?

YOUNG HUGH
(smiles, feels bad)
Yep, then we can go. Just like the
last house.
A little relieved.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
I love you sweetie. Sweet dreams.

CUT TO:
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS
Hugh gently CLOSES Nell’s door. Smiles to himself. He starts
down the hall, stopping at another door. Hand-drawn letters
reading SHIRLEY, clearly decorated by a little girl.
Behind him, we can see NELL’S DOOR, CLOSED, in the BG.
From inside, he hears A SOFT VOICE SPEAKING. He pushes the
door open. The soft light falls on YOUNG SHIRLEY (9), asleep
in her bed. Her eyes are closed, but she’s mumbling.
YOUNG SHIRLEY (0.S.)
(softly)
Dancing in the red room. Don’t step
so loud.
YOUNG HUGH
(smiling)
You're dreaming, Shirl.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
The pandas aren’t dreaming.

YOUNG HUGH
Pandas, huh?

YOUNG SHIRLEY
(trailing off)
Pandas don’t eat macaroni...

YOUNG HUGH
Noted.

He closes Shirley’s door. He’s about to walk away, but turns
to see -

NELL’S DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.
Odd, he just closed it...

He walks back, looking inside. Nell is lying motionless in
bed, on her side. She hasn’t moved since he last saw her.

Hugh frowns, and gently closes the door once again.
He walks away, leaving the upstairs hallway empty and dark.

We linger for a few extra moments, scrutinizing those
shadows. Wondering what they’re hiding...

CUT TO:
INT. MASTER BEDROOM, HILL HOUSE, THEN - MOMENTS LATER
Hugh CRAWLS back into bed. His wife MARY (30's) stirs.

MARY
Everyone alive?

YOUNG HUGH
Nellie had a nightmare and
Shirley's sleep-talking again.

MARY
Anything good?

YOUNG HUGH
Pandas don’t like macaroni, Mary.

Mary smiles as Hugh kisses her, and settles back into sleep.

Then, a SOUND. Like a GROANING, muffled. From within the
walls. Mary’s eyes open.

MARY
Again?

YOUNG HUGH
You're kidding.

He sits up, sighing.

MARY
I thought you replaced the pipes -

YOUNG HUGH
Gotta be something else, then. Or
the guy fucked it up.

Another GROAN from the walls.
YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
Fix one problem, find five more.

This house is a contractor’s dream.

MARY
Then how come they keep quitting?

They listen. All is quiet again.
YOUNG HUGH
(beat)
Nellie’s ready to go.

MARY
She's not alone. I miss the city.
YOUNG HUGH
This flips how I think it will,
I’1ll buy you a penthouse off the
park.

MARY
With a doorman.

She settles back onto her side to sleep.
MARY (CONT'D)
(chuckles )
Pandas don’t like macaroni.

He settles back into his pillow, closing his eyes.

CUT TO:

INT. NELL’S ROOM, HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS

Nell lays in her bed. She hugs her plush bear to her chest.
She rolls upright, looking at the spot by the foot of her bed
again.

There’s nothing there... though we note the DOOR IS OPEN
again.

Nell rolls onto her side. Facing her brother's bed. He’s
still sound asleep.

YOUNG NELL
Luke?

He SNORTS a little in his sleep, and rolls onto his side,
away from her. She frowns.

She stares at the NIGHT LIGHT, plugged into the wall. It
casts WARM COLORS and SHAPES on the wall above it. She fixes
her attention there. Her eyelids getting heavy...

She closes her eyes. We watch her try to sleep for a few long
moments. And then...

Something SHIFTS in the frame behind her. OUT OF FOCUS, IN
THE DARK, it’s been there this whole time but we’re only now
REALIZING IT -

The silhouette of a WOMAN.

NECK BENT AT A HORRIBLE ANGLE.

CUT TO:
INT. WALKER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

OVERHEAD CU: A smart phone voice recording ap. A finger moves
into frame, and hits “record.”

Legend: SACRAMENTO. NOW.

MRS. WALKER (0.C.)
Carl was driving on Rural 86 during
the storm. Do you remember that
storm? Course not, you were in LA.
It was a bad one. Cats and dogs,
worst I’ve seen in ten years.

REVEAL MRS. WALKER (50's), seated on her sofa. The sunlight
pouring in through the windows. She looks TIRED, bags under
her eyes. Absently holding a cup of tea in her hands.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
He was out there in the boons and
he lost control of the car. He went
over the guardrail, down a ravine.
The car flipped over and you
couldn’t see it from the road,
especially with the rain. Couldn't
even see the lights.

Reveal STEVEN CRANE (now grown up, in his mid 30's, a patient
expression on his handsome face.) In front of him, his phone
records her story.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
Took me an hour to figure he was
late. Almost three hours for
someone to start looking for him.
And I kept thinking maybe he just
stopped off, waited out the
weather.

She sips her tea. Steven watches, patient.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
He was, um... he was hanging there,
that whole time. Hours. Upside
down, tangled up in his seat belt.
They said he could reach the horn,
but he couldn’t hold it long
because - see, his arm was broken.

(beat)

And that’s how he died. Upside
down, pressing on that horn
whenever he could stand to.

Steven nods, scribbling a NOTE in his notebook.
She leans

10.

STEVEN
So when did it start?

MRS. WALKER
The night after he died. It started
with drops of water. I’d be asleep,
in our bed, and I'd be woken up
because I'd feel... rain, I guess.
Raindrops, falling onto my face.
I'd wake up, there’d be nothing
there. But my face would be a
little wet, and my pillow.

forward.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
It got worse. I’d hear a car horn.
Short bursts. Distant, I think, but
close enough to wake me and then,
finally - this was right after the
funeral itself, the night after he
was buried, you see —

Her voice quiets to almost a whisper.

She makes

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
I felt the water. On my cheeks, and
I heard the horn, and I looked up
at the ceiling and... there he was.
Hanging there, upside down.

eye contact with Steven, shaking her head.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
I could see the water dripping off
his hair, his face was a deep
purple, like the blood had all just
- pooled - in his cheeks.

(beat)

It’s funny, you think you'd scream
when you see something like that,
but you don’t. You just stare. You
just stare at it like an idiot,
like your brain just... tripped.

She swallows. This is hard for her to talk about.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
So it was dripping off him, the
rain and blood too, and he was just
staring at me and then his mouth
dropped open. But instead of a
scream it was - a car horn. Coming
out of his mouth. So loud.

(MORE )
11.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
So loud I fell off the bed. Then I
screamed. I screamed because I hit
the floor and it startled me, and
it was like I only just remembered -
“oh, right. I can scream. I should
probably scream.”

Steven nods, smiling gently.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
So I screamed all right, and then I
ran. Tripped in the hall and looked
back and he was gone, and I laid
there and I cried and that was...
that was the last time I’ve slept
in that room.

Steven nods. Waits, but it seems her tale is over. He reaches
forward, and TURNS OFF THE RECORDER.

STEVEN
That’s a very interesting story,
Mrs. Walker.

MRS. WALKER
Irene.

STEVEN
Irene. This is what I’d like to do.
I'd like to look around your house,
and I’d like to set up some
equipment. I’d also like to sleep
in that room tonight.

MRS. WALKER
Goodness -

STEVEN
I'll be fine. I can’t promise that
I‘1l include your story in my book -

MRS. WALKER
Of course -

STEVEN
But it’s possible. And I thank you
for sharing it with me.

MRS. WALKER
Well... thank you. For listening.

CUT TO:
12.

INT. WALKER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER

Steven moves through the house, taking it in. Taking a moment
to look at the PHOTOGRAPHS of Mrs. Walker with her husband,
CARL (60's). Happy photographs, of a normal couple in their
golden years.

He pauses at one showing Carl by a NEW CAR. Probably the one
he died in. Steven notes it, and moves toward the bookcase,
glancing at what’s on the shelves -—

HE STOPS.

We see one of the titles that has caught his eye:
THE HAUNTING OF DANVERS. BY STEVEN CRANE.

Next to it, more books. Similar fonts to the titles.
THE HAUNTING OF ARLINGTON CEMETERY. BY STEVEN CRANE.
THE HAUNTING OF ALCATRAZ. BY STEVEN CRANE.

He sighs, not surprised to see the first book, the thickest
book:

THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE. BY STEVEN CRANE.

He reaches out, picking it up. On the cover is a photograph
of HILL HOUSE, as we saw it in the beginning. He turns it
over, and on the back -

WE SEE THE FAMILY PICTURE from 1992, the faces now familiar
to us. Young Hugh, Mary, Young Steven, and his brothers and
sisters...

MRS. WALKER
I’m sorry, I should have told you.
I’m a fan.

He frowns, looking up. There are at least another EIGHT
BOOKS, “THE HAUNTING OF...” series. All written by him.

MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)

(off the one in his hand)
That's my favorite, the first one.
“Silence lay steadily against the
wood and stone of Hill House, and
whatever walked there, walked
alone.”

(beat)
I can’t imagine what it was like...
growing up there. The most famous
haunted house in America -
He stuffs

13.

STEVEN
In fairness, it wasn’t famous when
we moved in.

MRS. WALKER
I remember seeing your dad on TV,
during the trial. I always wondered
how he kept it together, with all
the media, the tabloids -

STEVEN
Well he didn’t exactly hide from
the media.

It was a long time ago.
the book back onto the shelf.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
And besides, you’ve got me beat.

MRS. WALKER
What do you mean?

STEVEN
I mean if you actually saw your
husband hanging upside down over
your bed, you’ve seen more than I
ever have.
(beat)
I’ve never seen a ghost.

MRS. WALKER
But your books -—

STEVEN
Not at Arlington, Danvers,
Alcatraz, the Queen Mary, or in
Williamsburg. And not in Hill
House.

MRS. WALKER
Oh. The way you write, I assumed -

STEVEN
Other people’s stories. People like
you, Irene. I give them the right
voice, is all.

Mrs. Walker is a little disappointed.

MRS. WALKER
Well I hope tonight is a game
changer for you.
14.

STEVEN
How so?

MRS. WALKER
Maybe my Carl can finally give you
a story of your own. You were one
of his favorite writers, so
Maybe... that’s the reason. For all
of this.

She smiles at him, hopeful. He feels sorry for her.

STEVEN
You know, I can tell you one thing
about Hill House that isn’t in the
book.

MRS. WALKER
(lights up)
Yes, please!

STEVEN
All those years, trying to
understand what happened in that
house, you know what I never found?
(beat)
A reason.

MRS. WALKER
(changing the subject)
How are your brothers and sisters?
I’ve wondered, since the book. How
are they doing these days?

His PHONE RINGS in his pocket. Saved by the bell. He turns,
fishing it out. The call is from NELL.

It rings for a beat... and he DECLINES THE CALL.
MRS. WALKER (CONT’D)
You know who I wish would write a
book? Your dad. I’d love to hear
what he says about that night...
STEVEN
(beat)
You and me both.
He steps away, looking further into the house.

15.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOCATION UNKNOWN - DAY

We watch as the outgoing call to STEVEN ends. Reveal NELL
(mid 20's now), looking down at the phone in her hand.

The hotel room looks CHEAP, the curtains are DRAWN tight,
keeping light out of the room.

Nell herself is ON EDGE. Pale, disheveled. Unkempt... and
clearly FRIGHTENED.

She shakes her head, frustrated -
And dials another number: SHIRLEY.

CUT TO:

EXT. HARRIS FUNERAL HOME - AFTERNOON

A humble, stately independent funeral home. The sign out
front reads HARRIS FAMILY FUNERAL HOME.

Legend: MASSACHUSETTS.

INT. HARRIS FUNERAL HOME, CONSULTATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A hand holds a phone. The incoming caller is NELL. A moment,
and then the call is DECLINED.

REVEAL SHIRLEY (early 30’s now, kind and genuine.) Sitting in
a chair, across from a GRIEVING FAMILY. It’s a funeral
INTAKE. Her husband RYAN (30's) sits beside her.

SHIRLEY
I’m sorry. So are you saying you'd
prefer not to do a viewing?

GRIEVING FATHER
No, we want to, it’s not that.

RYAN
It’s part of your mother’s pre-
need, so it’s already taken care
of.

GRIEVING MOTHER
And we want to. It’s Max, I think
he’s just a little...

Shirley turns to MAX (8 years old), who is COLORING by the
end table, near the CASKET CATALOGS.
16.

SHIRLEY
A little nervous about it?

GRIEVING FATHER
I’d say “adamantly opposed.”

In the nearby OFFICE, the LAND LINE rings. Shirley glances at
Ryan, and he stands to answer.

RYAN
I'm sorry, excuse me a moment.

Shirley smiles, getting up from her chair. She crouches next
to little Max.

SHIRLEY
Hi Max. I’m Shirley.

He looks up at her, smiling shyly.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
I know this might be a little weird
for you, but I promise this is all
normal. There’s nothing to be
scared of, not a single thing.

RYAN
(in background)
Harris funeral home... she’s with
clients, can I have her call you

back?
He looks back to his drawing.

SHIRLEY
The reason mommy and daddy are here
is that it’s important to say
goodbye to Grandma. A viewing is
just a way to do that, to see her
one last time and tell her you love
her.

Ryan smiles at Max’s parents. His wife is good at this, and
he knows it. Loves her for it.

MAX
I don’t need to say goodbye.

RYAN
A lot of people feel that way at
first, but they feel much better
when they do.
MAX
That’s what mommy said but she was
wrong. Grammy keeps sitting on my
bed at night and touching my hair.
She doesn’t say anything. She
doesn’t talk, even if I yell at
her. She just stares at me. And her
eyes must hurt.

SHIRLEY
Why?

MAX
Because she doesn’t blink.

Shirley frowns.

INT. HARRIS FUNERAL HOME, FOYER —- LATER

17.

CUT TO:

Shirley and Ryan stand with the parents, looking out the

front door where Max plays with a toy on the steps.

SHIRLEY
We see things like this from time
to time. He’s what, eight?

GRIEVING MOTHER
That’s right.

SHIRLEY
He’s still a little too young to
really understand death. Kids fall
back on memories to help them
process it. Whatever their
strongest memory is, or their most
recent, they’1l pull it up. Replay
it. Imagine them doing the things
they did in life.

The parents exchange glances, unsure.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
He'll be fine. You’1ll find the
funeral helps.

They nod.

GRIEVING FATHER
Thank you.

(MORE )
GRIEVING FATHER (CONT'D)
I don’t mean to embarrass you, but
my wife and I were talking, and we
wanted to ask...

18.

Shirley forces a smile. She already knows the question.

GRIEVING FATHER (CONT’D)
You're... Shirley Crane, right?

SHIRLEY
(beat, smiles)
It’s Harris now.

She reaches out, taking Ryan’s hand.

GRIEVING MOTHER
I thought so.

GRIEVING FATHER
But I told her she was probably -
makes sense, I guess. Your career
choice.
(realizes)
I’m sorry, I don’t mean offense.

SHIRLEY
I’m used to it. We’ll talk
tomorrow.

They watch them head out the doors, into the sun.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
Who was on the phone?

RYAN
Your sister.

Ryan puts

CUT TO:

INT. HARRIS FUNERAL HOME, SHIRLEY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Shirley sits at her desk, checking voicemail on her cell.

NELL (V.O.)
It’s Nell - I need you to call me.
It’s hard to explain. Everything's
so dark and it’s hard to understand
it but...

(long beat)
It’s about Luke. Just call me.
19.

Shirley sighs. She dials Nell back, waiting. It rings. And
rings. And rings. And then goes to voice mail. She sighs.

Ryan enters, carrying a LARGE FRAME and a hammer.

RYAN
It’s here!

Shirley looks up. He holds up the photograph - it’s of
Shirley and Ryan, and THEIR TWO CHILDREN (eight and six), the
HARRIS FAMILY FUNERAL HOME sign behind them.

SHIRLEY
That’s great.

Ryan goes to the wall, pulling down an older, smaller photo,
this one without the family.

RYAN
I think it sends the right message.
I sent it to Billy, he’1ll update
the website, and I think it could
work great for print, too. If
people still read papers, that is.

He starts HAMMERING a new nail into the wall. Shirley
watches, the BANGS of the hammer jarring her -

CUT TO:

INT. HILL HOUSE, DOWNSTAIRS, THEN - AFTERNOON

Young Shirley moves through the house. Around her, we hear
LOUD BANGS. LOUDER AS SHE APPROACHES...

She rounds the corner just in time to see Young Hugh taking
aim with a sledgehammer.

He’s targeting a wall, already stripped and opened in several
places.

He swings, THE LOUD BANG as the hammer connects. It punches a
BIG HOLE, and a BURST of dust BLOWS OUT at Hugh’s face. He’s
COUGHS, stumbling back. Laughing a little.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
You okay daddy?

YOUNG HUGH
Yeah sweetie, just taking out this
wall.
(wiping dust from his
face)

20.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT'D)
House isn’t too happy about it, I
guess.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
You're too loud.

YOUNG HUGH
Sorry honey. This is gonna be
great, you'll be able to see right
into the dining room. A little
counter here, see?
(remembers )
Hey. I found something for you.

He reaches into his pockets, and pulls out AN OLD METAL KEY.
Shirley's face LIGHTS UP.

CUT TO:

INT. HILL HOUSE, TOP OF THE STAIRCASE, THEN - AFTERNOON

Young Shirley heads up the stairs. Just beyond the landing,
Mary stands in the hall, looking confused.

MARY
Shirl, come here a sec.

Shirley has somewhere else she wants to be.

SHIRLEY
But Nellie and I are -

MARY
Just for a second.

She heads toward her mother.
MARY (CONT'D)
Stand here... is it cold? Do you
feel cold?
YOUNG SHIRLEY
(stands )
Yeah.
Mary takes two steps to her right.

MARY
Not here though.

Shirley follows suit.
21.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
Nope.

MARY

(stepping back)
But here... you feel that?

Shirley shivers, nodding.
MARY (CONT'D)
No vent, no windows - but there’s a
draft, right?
YOUNG SHIRLEY
Maybe Daddy’s making more holes.
Can I go play now?
MARY
(lost in thought)
The hell is that coming from?

Shirley takes that as a “yes,” and bounds down the hall,
toward the next set of stairs.

CUT TO:

INT. HILL HOUSE, ATTIC, THEN - CONTINUOUS

Shirley steps into a LARGE ROOM off the attic. Young Nell is
already there, playing on the floor in front of a -

LARGE RED DOOR.
Nell GIGGLES, on her hands and knees, eyes close to the door.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
I got it!

YOUNG NELL
(eager)
Open it!

Shirley rushes to the red door, the key in her hand.
YOUNG SHIRLEY
Daddy says this is a master key.
It’s supposed to open any of the
doors in the house -

YOUNG NELL
What do you think is in there?

Shirley pushes the key into the lock.
22.

YOUNG NELL (CONT’D)
What if it’s a cotton candy
machine?

YOUNG SHIRLEY
(working the key)
That'd be something.

YOUNG NELL
Or a pony.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
Not a pony. This isn’t working.

YOUNG NELL
You don’t know that, it could be a
pony. Something was moving, I saw
the shadow under the door.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
Daddy said this door’s been locked
for years and years and years, so
if there’s a pony in there, it’s
dead.

Nell’s face falls into a horrified shock. Shirley jiggles the
key, but no luck. The door isn’t opening.

YOUNG SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
This one doesn’t work either.

YOUNG NELL
(pouting)
Where’s the freakin’ key!

YOUNG SHIRLEY
(chuckling)
Don’t say that word.

YOUNG NELL
You say it.

They sit back, staring at the red door.

YOUNG NELL (CONT’D)
The keys never work. Can’t he just
use that big hammer?

YOUNG SHIRLEY
He says he’s gonna finish
downstairs before he starts up
here.
(beat)
(MORE )
23.

YOUNG SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
We'll find the key. I wanna see
what’s in there too.

YOUNG NELL
If it’s candy, I’ll share it with
you fifty and fifty.

Shirley smiles at her, brushing the hair from her face.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
Come on. Let’s see if daddy has any
more keys.

They SCAMPER out of the room. The camera LINGERS on the red
door. It may just be our imagination...

But we swear we see A SHADOW MOVE silently underneath it...

YOUNG NELL (0.S.)
Daddy! We need more keys, it’s an
emergency!

CUT TO:

INT. WALKER HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Steven holds the phone to his ear as he hooks up an INFRARED
CAMERA, pointed up to the ceiling above the bed.

STEVEN
(distracted)
I know you don’t need me to tell
you this, but literally everything
is an emergency with Nell.

He hits a button on his LAPTOP, and we see the CAMERA FEED on
the screen. He tests it, recording a few seconds.
INT. HARRIS FUNERAL HOME, FRONT PORCH - INTERCUT

Shirley holds the phone to her ear. Behind her, the new
picture is displayed prominently.

SHIRLEY

I know, but she sounded rough.
STEVEN

Shirl -
SHIRLEY

Rougher than usual. She said it was
about Luke.
24.

STEVEN
So call Luke.

He leans over the laptop. A few more KEYSTROKES and the
footage is logged.

SHIRLEY
I did. Someone else answered.

STEVEN
So he sold his phone, or traded it,
which means he’s using again, which
means we stay out of it. I can’t
deal with this right now, I’m
working.

SHIRLEY
(with an edge)
Yeah? You working?

Steven shakes his head. There’s something here, we can almost

sense the

She hangs

fight they’re not having, underneath their words...

STEVEN
That's right, Shirley. Something
else you want to add?

SHIRLEY
(beat)
Fine. I’1l just handle it, shall I?
That's why everybody dumps their
shit on me, isn’t it Steve. I’m the
oldest, it’s my job. Oh wait -
that’s you.

up. Steven puts the phone down, shakes it off.

Takes a breath, and goes back to setting up his equipment.

He turns,
clutching

She hands

He turns,

MRS. WALKER
Tea?

smiling. Mrs. Walker stands in the doorway,
a mug.

STEVEN
Sure, thank you.

it over. He takes a sip, nodding his gratitude.
MRS. WALKER

So does this stuff... you know.

Capture the supernatural?

smiling a little.
25.

STEVEN
Don’t believe in that word.

MRS. WALKER
(confused)
Oh...

STEVEN
(smiles)
I’m just talking about the word
itself; “supernatural.” There’s
“natural” phenomena that we
understand, and then there’s
“natural” phenomena that we don’t.

He adjust the camera.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Primitive humans used to die of
fright during an eclipse. They had
no idea what it was. The eye of an
angry god, an evil spirit - nothing
supernatural about it, though. Once
we understood it, well... it was
just “natural.”

He sips his tea, sitting on the bed.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
I prefer “preternatural.” Natural
phenomena that we don’t quite
understand yet.

MRS. WALKER
(beat)
So will it capture that? The
preternatural?

STEVEN
This just captures infrared light.
(beat, smiles)
But you never know.

CUT TO:

EXT. WALKER HOUSE - EVENING

Steven has the phone to his ear as he opens the trunk of his
car. A BEEP as it goes to voice mail.

STEVEN
It’s Steve. Missed your call. Been
a minute, hasn’t it.

(MORE )
26.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Listen, I’m working but if it’s
actually an emer -

He closes his eyes, realizing he needs to change his tone.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
I‘1l be around tomorrow if you
still need to chat. I... I hope
you're well, Nellie. I mean that.

Steven shuts his trunk, throwing his overnight bag over his
shoulder. He looks up at the unassuming house he’1l be
spending the night in.

He leans against the trunk, pulling a cigarette from his
pocket. He lights it, drawing deep. Takes a few moments, and
we can tell something is nagging him. Another drag...

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Goddammit.

He lifts up his phone. In his contacts, we see:
SACRED HEART SHELTER. A number already programmed. He dials.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
Hey, it’s Steve Crane... yep, and
how are you? I wanted to see if
Luke’s been staying there lately.

CUT TO:

INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

The club is THUMPING. Colored lights, loud music, lots of
young people dancing the night away.

Close on a MARTINI being set on the bar.

A WOMAN’S HAND reaches into frame, wearing a thin DESIGNER
GLOVE. She picks up the drink, and lifts it to her lips.

She’s THEO (late 20’s now, dark mascara. Effortlessly sexy,
but intentionally unapproachable.) She smiles at the
bartender, taking a healthy sip of the drink.

She turns her back to the bar, leaning on her elbows. Looking
out at the dance floor. Her wandering eyes (and her tight
clothes) tell us she’s on the prowl.

Across the way, a HANDSOME GUY gives her a smile. Theo rolls
her eyes, sips her drink. Not interested.
27.

Then, someone catches her eye...

TRISH (20's, very pretty), leaning against the bar. Theo
watches, interested. Slowly TAKES OFF ONE OF HER GLOVES.

Trish can feel someone staring at her, and looks. Theo’s
staring right at her, a smile on her face. Trish looks away,
playing it cool.

After a few moments, she turns back to where Theo was
leaning. Theo is gone.

THEO (0.S.)
Hi.

She turns. Theo’s just a few inches away, having closed the
distance undetected.

THEO (CONT'D)
Theodora.

Trish smiles.
TRISH
Trish.
INT. NIGHT CLUB - LATER
Theo and Trish DANCE. The music blasts, the lights dance
across them. Theo is aggressive, confident. Pulling Trish

close, lips inches from hers as they writhe together.

The dance is very sexual, Trish giving into it as she ARCHES
HER BACK, throwing her head back -

CUT TO:

INT. THEO’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

- Trish’s head is thrown back, her back arched above the
mattress —

And she COLLAPSES, EXHALING. Smiling wide, her hair and face
glistening with sweat.

Seconds later Theo appears from below frame, still wearing a
tank top, flopping next to her. They catch their breath.

TRISH
(out of breath)
Jesus, where did you come from?
28.

Theo looks up at the ceiling, satisfied. Smiles, but we can
tell she doesn’t feel much like talking.

TRISH (CONT'D)
How did you do that?! It was like
you knew exactly what I -

THEO
Haven't been with a lot of girls,
have you.

TRISH

No, that’s not it, it’s just -

Theo rolls over. Sits up, reaching over to the night stand.
Finds what she’s looking for:

A joint. She lights it.
Trish rolls over, propping herself up.

TRISH (CONT'D)
So what’s your story?

THEO
What do you mean?

TRISH
I mean, who are you? What do you
do? Where are you from?

Theo takes a drag off the joint. Smiles at her.

TRISH (CONT'D)
I’m here for grad school.
Sociology. The program is brutal
but I love Boston, it’s such a
great town. Do you venture into the
city much or stay out here in the
‘burbs?

Theo starts PUTTING HER GLOVES back on.

TRISH (CONT'D)
(off the gloves)
What’s that about?

THEO
I'm kind of a Germaphobe.

TRISH
(beat)
That’s okay, none taken.
29.

Theo turns, resting her gloved hand on Trish’s thigh.

THEO
That was good.

TRISH
(leaning closer)
Damn right.

THEO
I’ve got to work. Early.

TRISH
Oh. Oh! Okay.

She sits up, a little confused. Watching as Theo pulls her
jeans back on.

TRISH (CONT'D)
Okay.

CUT TO:

INT. THEO’S BEDROOM, FRONT DOOR —- MOMENTS LATER

We realize Theo’s apartment is a STUDIO. The bedroom we were
just in is actually most of the room. A small kitchenette, a
bathroom. It’s more of a GUEST HOUSE.

Theo OPENS the door to let Trish out.

TRISH
Was it something I did?

THEO
Nope. Just not much more to say, we
did what we came here to do, yeah?

TRISH
(disappointed)
Okay then.

Theo lets her out, and then walks over to the fridge. Opens
it up, and takes out TWO BEERS.

CUT TO:

EXT. HARRIS FUNERAL HOME, FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Shirley is sitting on the front porch, looking out at the
stars over the trees. She hears footsteps coming from around
the side of the house, and looks over to see -
30.

TRISH, walking away from THE GUEST HOUSE. Heading up the
driveway, toward her car. She stops as she sees Shirley
watching her.

Shirley waves, casual. Trish waves back, and gets in the car.

Shirley smiles a little, and looks back just in time to see
Theo emerge from the front door of the guest house, beers in
hand.

Heading her way.

THEO
(holding out the beer)
Figured you could use one.

Theo sits next to her sister, watching as the car pulls away.

SHIRLEY
New friend?

Theo just sips her beer.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
She gonna come back?

THEO
Oh, no. Sweet enough, but she’s got
a pile of issues. Dependency,
abandonment issues, so much
confusion...
(beat)
She was a good kisser though.

SHIRLEY
You know what amazes me? It’s
always one date. One date, and you
think you know everybody's life
story. One night, and they’re
codependent. Mommy issues.
Emotionally abusive.

THEO
They are.

SHIRLEY
Those aren't things you glean off
someone in a few hours, Theo.
You’ve got to actually get to know
them! People are tough, they take
time to show you their true colors.

THEO
Not necessarily.
31.

SHIRLEY
Yeah? How old were you when you
came out? Twenty five? Because we
didn’t have a clue. None of us. And
we've known you your whole life.

Theo shrugs it off.

THEO
Once there’s a deal breaker, I
don’t waste their time. Or mine. I
think that’s kinder.

SHIRLEY
You're like a guy! You’re worse
than a guy. You're like a frat guy.
When I said you could live here, I
wasn’t expecting the pussy parade.

Theo chuckles, swigs her beer.

THEO
So what's bugging you?

SHIRLEY
How did you know something was
bugging me?
(Theo waits)
Nell called me today.

THEO
So?

SHIRLEY
She sounded bad.

THEO
Because it sucks to be Nell.

SHIRLEY
She call you?

THEO
Nope, she knows better. Haven’t
talked to her in three months -

SHIRLEY
Theo -

THEO
If she apologizes, maybe - maybe -
we can talk. But until she does,
forget it.

(MORE )
32.

THEO (CONT'D)
(beat)
What’s wrong with her?

SHIRLEY
I don’t know.

THEO
One foot in crazy and the other on
a banana peel. Her whole life.
That's just Nell, the worst thing
you can do is let yourself feel
responsible for her state of mind.

SHIRLEY
She said it was about Luke. I don’t
know, something about it scared me.

Theo nods, taking another pull off the beer.

THEO
He’1ll show up. When he needs money.

SHIRLEY
I just keep thinking, what if he
doesn’t... or if he does, it’s the
last time I’1l ever see him -

THEO
I feel that way every time I see
him.

RYAN (0.S.)

You ladies okay?
They turn as Ryan steps onto the porch.

SHIRLEY
Hey sweetie. Yeah, we're okay.

Theo finishes her beer.

THEO
The beer has gone and so must I.

They stand.

SHIRLEY
Thanks for the company.

She hands Theo her beer, which is still HALF FULL. Theo takes
a sip as Shirley steps inside.
33.

RYAN
(smiling)
And how're you doing?

Theo turns her attention to Ryan. Not sure why he’s
lingering.

THEO
I’m pretty nifty, Ryan. How are
you?

RYAN
I’m good.

Theo waits.

RYAN (CONT'D)
Really good. Your sister and I are
talking about shutting the business
down for a week, maybe getting out
of town.

THEO
Scandalous.

RYAN
Not sure if it’s happening yet,
just a heads up.
She finishes the beer, putting the bottle down.

THEO
Well keep me posted, handsome.

She turns, walking away. Ryan picks up the bottle, and goes
to head back inside...

LINGERING for just a moment in the doorway. Watching Theo
walk away, in those tight jeans...

THEO (CONT'D)
(without looking back)
Good night Ryan.
Startled, Ryan pulls the door open.

RYAN
Good night!

EXT. HUGH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A small, humble house, nestled in the suburbs. Palm trees
abound.

Legend: FLORIDA

INT. HUGH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

HUGH CRANE (in his 60’s now) is asleep in his bed. Silence
and darkness in the room...

We sense the mattress DEPRESS next to him, as though someone
just climbed into bed with him.

Hugh’s eyes SLOWLY OPEN.

He waits. Nothing. After a few long seconds...

A WOMAN’S ARM SILENTLY REACHES AROUND HIM.
Spooning him. Pulling herself up against his back.
HUGH DOESN’T MOVE.

Just lays there, eyes open. Not making a sound.

Her arm hangs around him, and finally GOES LIMP, as if she’s
just GONE TO SLEEP.

VERY slowly, Hugh looks down at the hand dangling in front of
him.

He swallows. Holds his breath.

VERY SLOWLY... so as not to wake her... he begins to ROLL
OVER, TURNING TO GET A LOOK AT HER FACE...

Slowly he turns, careful to be as SILENT AS POSSIBLE.

As he passes the halfway point, almost to the point he could
just begin to see her face -

SHE SCREAMS -

DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE, A HIGH, SHRILL SCREECH -

HUGH’S EYES FLY OPEN.

HE BOLTS UPRIGHT IN BED. HE’S ALONE... NO ONE ELSE IS THERE.

The SHRILL SCREECH is just his RINGING PHONE.
35.

He catches his breath, letting the nightmare recede. The
phone keeps ringing, and he finally lifts it off the night
stand.

IT’S NELL.

He answers the phone, shaken, slowly waking up.

HUGH
Nell?

NELL (0.S.)
Daddy...

HUGH

Honey? You okay? What time is it?

He starts to shuffle in the bed, getting comfortable,
settling back down.

NELL
(beat)
Do you remember the bent-neck lady?
HUGH SITS UP IN BED.

Staring ahead, very still now. The color has DRAINED FROM HIS
FACE. He takes this VERY SERIOUSLY.

HUGH
(quietly)
Yes.
NELL
She's back.

Hugh swallows. Catches his breath.

HUGH
Okay. Okay.
(beat)
Where are you?

CUT TO:

INT. NELL’S CAR - INTERCUT

Nell is behind the wheel of her car. The engine isn’t
running. It is VERY DARK outside, she’s surrounded by
OVERGROWN TREES. No street lights AT ALL.

NELL
I’m at home. In bed.
36.

Like she’s parked in the MIDDLE OF THE WOODS.

CUT TO:

INT. HUGH’S BEDROOM - INTERCUT
Hugh sighs.

HUGH
Okay, stay there. Listen... I want
you to go to Steve and Shaye’s. I
can drive to Orlando, get a flight
to L.A. in the morning. Steve’s the
closest, you go to him, and -
(beat)
I‘1l meet you there, sweetie.

Nell smiles a little. Sadly.

NELL
Okay. I love you, daddy.

Something about the way she says it doesn’t sit right with
Hugh.

HUGH
Are you okay?

INT. NELL’S CAR - INTERCUT

Nell smiles, sadly. Tears fall down her cheeks, but her voice
doesn’t betray her feelings.

NELL
I'm fine. I’m sorry to wake you.
Good night, daddy.

She hangs up. Takes a deep breath. Looks forward, at
something we can’t see, in the darkness beyond the front of
the car.

Then, she GETS OUT OF THE CAR, leaving the DOOR OPEN... and
walks into the darkness.

CUT TO:

INT. HUGH’S BEDROOM - INTERCUT

Hugh stares at the phone in his hand. Looking around his
room, taking deep breaths. THIS MAN IS AFRAID. He shakes his
head, this isn’t possible...
37.
Finally, he gets up. Goes to his closet, pulling his bags
down.

He QUICKLY PACKS HIS THINGS, throwing just what he needs in
the suitcase.

Bag in hand, he PULLS THE BEDROOM DOOR OPEN -

CUT TO:

INT. STEVEN'S ROOM, HILL HOUSE, THEN - NIGHT

- YOUNG HUGH BURSTS through Young Steven’s door, startling
the boy.

YOUNG HUGH
Get up. Stevie, get up.

YOUNG STEVEN
Dad? What’s —

YOUNG HUGH
Get up, we have to get out of here.
Right now.

YOUNG STEVEN
Why? What’s -

YOUNG HUGH
Quietly.

He pulls Steven up by the arm, moving him toward the door.

YOUNG STEVEN
My shoes -

YOUNG HUGH
Shhh.

Hugh pokes his head out into the hallway -
AND QUICKLY PULLS IT BACK, as though he SAW SOMETHING.
Slowly, silently, he PULLS THE DOOR CLOSED.

He keeps one hand on the doorknob, and raising a finger to
his lips with the other. “Shhhh.”

Steven nods, confused.
He stares at his father. Hugh is SWEATING, PALE. PANICKED.

Steven studies him, he doesn’t know why his father is acting
like this.
38.

Then he hears -

FOOTSTEPS IN THE HALLWAY. Moving closer and closer. Slow,
almost SHAMBLING.

Hugh holds the door knob, reaching up to gently PUSH THE
BUTTON LOCK.

They wait in silence as the footsteps REACH THE DOOR.
Nothing for a few seconds...
AND THEN THE KNOB STARTS TO TURN. Softly, exploring.

Hugh RELEASES HIS GRIP but keeps his hand hovering around the
door knob, watching it turn softly.

They wait, HOLDING THEIR BREATH...
And the footsteps BEGIN TO WALK AWAY.

Further and further down the hallway they go, until all is
silent again.

Hugh turns to his son.
YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
(whispering)
We're going to run.

YOUNG STEVEN
Dad, what's happening -

YOUNG HUGH
Quiet.

He reaches down for the doorknob, and slowly -
TRYING NOT TO MAKE A SOUND -
TURNS THE KNOB UNTIL THE LOCK DISENGAGES.

He takes a breath, and then silently PUSHES THE DOOR OPEN. He
pokes his head into the hall, looking both ways.

After a moment, he STARTS BREATHING AGAIN. He turns to
Steven.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
I’m going to carry you.

YOUNG STEVEN
What? I can -
39.

YOUNG HUGH
Hold on to me, very tight. Keep
your eyes closed. No matter what
you hear, don’t open them. Do you
promise?

YOUNG STEVEN

YOUNG HUGH
Do you promise?

YOUNG STEVEN
(beat)
I promise.
Hugh SCOOPS him up, which is tough. He’s not a little kid
anymore. Steven awkwardly wraps his arms around his dad’s
neck, hooking his legs around his hips.
Hugh WINCES from the weight, but manages to support him.
YOUNG HUGH
Eyes closed. No matter what. Eyes
closed.

Steven shakes his head, rests his chin on his father’s
shoulder, and CLOSES HIS EYES.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Okay. Okay... okay.

CUT TO:

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS

He pushes the door open and starts moving FAST down the
hallway.

WE STAY ON STEVEN’S CLOSED EYES. We hear -
HUGH'S FOOTSTEPS, heavy with the weight of both of them.
But then, something else —
BANGS. CREAKING WOOD.
As though the house around him is MOVING AS WELL.
HUGH

(desperate)
Eyes closed!
40.

The BANGS GET LOUDER, and then -

AN EAR-SHATTERING SCREECH comes from the other end of the
hall.

A woman SCREAMING, growing in volume and intensity -

Just as Hugh is about to round the corner, Steven OPENS HIS
EYES -

YOUNG STEVEN'S POV: The hallway, dark, but for just a split
second before we turn the corner we think we see -

A WOMAN, AT THE FAR END OF THE HALLWAY -—

EITHER IN A NIGHTGOWN OR A LONG DRESS -—
ADVANCING QUICKLY -

Hugh turns the corner, and we can’t see any more.

CUT TO:

INT. FOYER, HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS

Hugh’s feet THUNDER down the stairs, clutching Steven to him.
Sprinting toward the door.

Behind them, a HORRIBLE VOICE SHRIEKS:

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
BRING HIIMMM BAAAACCCCKKKK!

Hugh barrels toward the front door, WHICH IS ALREADY OPEN.
Panting, gasping for air, he RUNS OUTSIDE, the boy in his
arms.

CUT TO:

EXT. HILL HOUSE, THEN - CONTINUOUS

Hugh SPINS Steven in his arms, putting his FEET ON THE
GROUND.

YOUNG HUGH
The car!

Steven’s eyes are open now, he starts RUNNING next to his
father, panicked.

Behind them, the front door of Hill House SLAMS SHUT.
41.

Steven starts to turn to look, but Hugh PUSHES him forward.

YOUNG HUGH (CONT’D)
Keep going!

As Steven nears the car, he sees -—
ALL OF HIS SIBLINGS ARE ALREADY INSIDE.

Nell up front. Theo, Shirley, and Luke are all there, in
their pajamas, all shouting and panicked.

They get to the car and Steven opens the back door, climbing
in. Hugh races for the driver's seat.

CUT TO:

INT. HUGH’S CAR, THEN -—- CONTINUOUS

Young Hugh FUMBLES with the keys, trying to get the car
started. Around him, the kids shriek.

YOUNG SHIRLEY
What’s happening?! What’s
happening?!

YOUNG THEO
Daddy!! Daddy?!

Nell just SOBS LOUDLY. Hugh IGNORES THEM, TURNING OVER the
engine. It ROARS as he floods it with gas.

Steven surveys the scene, breathing heavy, and REALIZES -
YOUNG STEVEN
(realizing)
Where’s mom?
Steven looks back up at the house as -

Hugh FLOORS IT.

The tires DIG INTO THE GRAVEL, throwing it up behind the car
as he swings it onto the drive.

The kids SHOUT and CRY, panicked and lost.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
Where’s mom! Dad, where’s mom!

Hugh ignores him. Drives as FAST AS HE CAN away from Hill
House, while his children scream and cry.
42.

Steven turns around in his seat, looking at the house, dark
against the woods, as it gets smaller in the window.

In the GRAND, GOTHIC UPSTAIRS WINDOW he sees -

THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN, IN A LONG NIGHTGOWN (OR IS ITA
DRESS?) STARING DOWN AT THEM.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
Dad! Dad! We can’t leave mom!
Where’s mom!
Hugh drives, CRYING NOW.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
Dad! Dad! DAD!

CUT TO:

INT. WALKER HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

STEVEN
Dad...

Steven holds his phone to his ear, speaking softly while he
PACES. The house is dark, all of his equipment is set up and
running.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Dad, I can’t.

INT. HUGH’S CAR - INTERCUT
Hugh DRIVES in the dark, pale.

HUGH
You’re the closest. Your sister
needs you.

INT. WALKER HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - INTERCUT

STEVEN
She’s freaked about Luke. I already
called all the shelters and the
clinics looking for him, like she
wanted -

HUGH
That’s not -
43.

STEVEN
- and unless he shows up in a
morgue, we all know what he’s
doing. He’ll pop up in a week or
two looking for money, just like
every other time -

HUGH
This isn’t about Luke.

STEVEN
Nell said it was.

HUGH
It’s about her. Get home, stay with
her. Don’t let her out of your
sight. I'll meet you there.

STEVEN
Dad, listen, I’m not even -

Hugh hangs up.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
- living at home right now.

He lowers the phone. Sighs.

AT THE INFRARED CAMERA: Steven takes a look at the ceiling
above the bed. Just grey, nothing unusual. He scribbles a
note, checking his watch.

AT THE WINDOW: Steven looks out at the street below. They’re
on the corner lot, the empty roads lit by street lights.

The roads SHIMMER with the faint rain.

He settles into the bed. On his back, still clothed. Looks
around.

Steven’s POV: the ceiling above him. No spirit, just the
light fixture.

He closes his eyes, going to sleep.

CUT TO:

INT. THEO’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

The camera slowly moves in on Theo, asleep in her bed. We
drift toward the ALARM clock.

We see the time, glowing red in the darkness: 3:02 am.
44,

As we watch, it changes to 3:03...

And Theo suddenly BURSTS UP IN BED, a startled SCREAM in her
throat.

She GASPS, her hand absently clutching her neck. Eyes wide.
Like she woke from a nightmare.

CUT TO:

INT. HARRIS FUNERAL HOME, SHIRLEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Ryan is STARTLED by a SHORT SCREAM. DISORIENTED, he sits up,
looking around as he gets his bearings -

SHIRLEY IS SITTING UPRIGHT IN BED. Gasping, breathing heavy.
Hand over her heart.

SHIRLEY
(catching her breath)
Nellie’s in the Red Room...

RYAN
Shirl?

She blinks at him. Snapping out of it.

SHIRLEY
Oh... sorry...

RYAN
What’d you say?

SHIRLEY
I don’t... what?

We can tell she can’t remember. And we notice, though he
doesn’t, the clock beside her. 3:03.

CUT TO:

EXT. UNDER AN OVERPASS, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

WAKING WITH A START, A STRUNG-OUT YOUNG MAN (20's, filthy)
scrambles to his feet. Under the overpass there are tents,
blankets - the tiny homeless colony common to the city.

He knocks against the trash can, startling others. Staring
wildly at the BLANKET he was just asleep on, eyes wide.

CUT TO:
45.

INT. WALKER HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Steven’s eyes BURST OPEN. He looks around, catching his
breath. Something woke him up...

We realize the clock beside him reads 12:03 am.

There’s nothing in the room. Steven slowly closes his eyes,
going back to sleep.

From high above him, the camera SLOWLY BOOMS DOWN on his face
until we land in a CLOSE UP...

A DROP OF WATER HITS HIS FOREHEAD.
He opens his eyes. Looks up at the ceiling...

NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. Just the light fixture, and a
whole lot of ceiling.

He WAITS. WAITS...

ANOTHER DRIP.

Intrigued, Steven ROLLS OUT OF BED. Stands up.

Looks at the ceiling, the light fixture.

Waits.

Looks down at the pillow on the bed...

WAITS...

DRIP. A drop of water hits the pillow.

Steven STEPS UP ONTO THE BED, looking up at the ceiling.

He STRETCHES ON THE TIPS OF HIS TOES, trying to identify the
source of the water...

WAITS...
WAITS...
A CAR HORN BLARES!

Steven SPINS, almost FALLING off the bed. He turns, looking
out the window -

And from his height, he can see the TWO CARS in the
intersection that just avoided a collision.

Another SHORT HONK, and they go off in separate ways.
46.

Steven SMILES, catching his breath.
STEVEN'S POV: The intersection, dark.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WALKER HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
- Steven's POV: The intersection, IN DAYLIGHT.

STEVEN
There was a stop sign there until
recently, yes?

Steven stands at the window, with Mrs. Walker next to him.

MRS. WALKER
.--. I don’t know, I think so.

STEVEN
There’s a pole there, see? But no
sign.

There is indeed a silver pole sticking up from the ground at
the intersection... but nothing on it.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Kids take them for their dorm
rooms. It’s a moderately trafficked
area; a four way stop without a
sign is bound to have a few near
misses.

(beat)
You slept better with your husband
in bed, right?

MRS. WALKER
Of course.

STEVEN
You're probably just noticing the
car horns now because you’re not
sleeping as well. Things you used
to sleep through.
(beat)
The water...

Steven hops up onto the bed. He reaches up, slowly turning
unscrewing the bolt holding the light fixture.
47.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
It was a big storm the night he
died, one of the biggest you've
seen in a long time.

MRS. WALKER
Yes...

STEVEN
There’s a leak in your roof. And
you just didn’t notice the water
damage because...

He removes the bolt, and PULLS DOWN THE LIGHT FIXTURE. There,
where the power cord goes into the ceiling, is a WATER STAIN.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
It was covered. It was only
drizzling last night, and I even
got a few drips.

He places the light fixture on the night stand, and waits
patiently. Mrs. Walker looks up at the stain, and we can
tell... SHE’S EMBARRASSED.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
This happens all the time, Mrs.
Walker.

MRS. WALKER
And the man I saw hanging from my
ceiling?

Steven sighs, sitting on the mattress.

STEVEN
The mind... it is a powerful thing,
ma’am. Especially the grieving

mind.

MRS. WALKER
I know what I saw -

STEVEN
The water, the car horn, you’d be
picturing how he died, as much as
you wouldn’t want to -

MRS. WALKER
I saw him.
48.

STEVEN
And when you push that stuff down,
it comes out at night. You couldn’t
help it.

She shakes her head. She’1ll buy the rest, but not that.
Steven frowns. He speaks softly, gentler.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
When I said I’ve never seen a
ghost, that’s not exactly true.
I’ve seen a lot of ghosts. Just not
the way you think.

He steps closer, sympathetic.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
A ghost can be a lot of things. A
memory, a daydream. A secret.
Guilt, grief, anger. But in my
experience, most times they’re just
what we want to see -

MRS. WALKER
He looked so horrible. Why would I
want to see my Carl... like that?
STEVEN
Because it’s better than never
seeing him again.

She looks at him, tears in her eyes.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Most times, a ghost is a wish.

CUT TO:

INT. WALKER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Steven reaches up, taking down the copy of THE HAUNTING OF
HILL HOUSE from the book shelf. He looks at it, sighs.

He sits down on the couch, pen in hand. Opens the book, to
the title page, and starts to inscribe.

“To Irene... thank you, and Carl, for your support. ‘And
whatever walked there... walked alone’.

He signs his name with a flourish. Mrs. Walker watches,
smiling to herself.
49,

MRS. WALKER
Thank you for doing that. Carl
would have loved it.

STEVEN
My pleasure.

He finishes signing, and closes the book. Looks at the cover,
and the photograph of his childhood home. As he stares at it -

CUT TO:

INT. STEVEN AND SHAYE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

A MANUSCRIPT of THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE is forcefully
DROPPED on the table in front of Steven.

He’s a few years younger, and living in a modest apartment.
He looks up, startled by the loud noise. Shirley stands in
front of him... she’s PREGNANT.

SHIRLEY
The fuck, Steve.

STEVEN
You didn’t like it?

SHIRLEY
No. I didn’t like it.

From the other room, Steven’s wife SHAYE (30's) enters, a
little alarmed by the argument.

SHAYE
What’s going on?

SHIRLEY
My brother just raped the family,
is what’s going on.

STEVEN
Hang on.

SHIRLEY
Look, I get that things haven't
exactly been going well with your
writing, and when you said you were
doing a book about the house I
understood that. But this -
50.

STEVEN
I sent you guys the manuscript in
case you objected to anything, I
didn’t have to do that -

SHIRLEY
Of course I object! We object,
Steven!

SHAYE

Let’s calm down a bit -

SHIRLEY
You be calm, Shaye, your name’s not
in here. He’s not exploiting your
worst memories for some
sensationalized coffee table book,
it’s not your family -

SHAYE
(hurt)
Hey! It is my family, I’m a Crane
now too -
SHIRLEY

You weren’t there.

(back to Steven)
Nell. Luke. Theo. They were just
kids, the things they told you in
confidence -

STEVEN
I’m clear that they were kids -

SHIRLEY
You make mom sound fucking crazy -

STEVEN
Oh, mom wasn’t crazy?

SHIRLEY
And the Dudleys, and dad - this is
the worst of the bullshit, worse
than dad with the tabloids -

STEVEN
Dad's had every opportunity to set
it straight - what am I supposed to
write? He said it was haunted,
those are his words -

SHIRLEY
He was a wreck! He just lost his
wife -
STEVEN
- and he hasn't said shit about it
since then! Does he talk to you,
Shirl? Has he told you what
happened that night? Because all
I’ve got are the tabloid quotes, he
refuses to tell us anything else -

SHIRLEY
He believed it, Steve!

This shuts him up.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
When he said those things he
believed them, in the moment at
least, but you... you never did -

STEVEN
Neither did you -

SHIRLEY
- and now you're digging up all
that stuff, so you can make a buck
and stop living on credit for a

change -
STEVEN
(incredulous)
A buck.

Shaye steps into the room, toward her husband. Cautious, she

knows how this goes...

SHAYE
Honey, she’s upset, don’t make it -

STEVEN
You know how much they offered on
the advance? A buck... this is a
life for us, Shirl. We can get a
house. We can move to L.A. I have
to start a real life. For my own
family -

SHIRLEY
We’re your family, Steve.
(beat)
And what you're doing to mom -

STEVEN
Mom was mentally ill. It’s a fact.
And damned if the apple didn’t fall
too far from -—
52.

He STOPS HIMSELF. Too far. Shirley GLARES, the wound obvious.

SHIRLEY
Wow.

STEVEN
(standing, regretful)
I’m sorry. That wasn’t -

SHIRLEY
Wow.

He holds his hands up, and we see he truly regrets saying
that. Shirley collects herself.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
You sent me your book, now you know
what I think. You publish this, you
know what it costs.

STEVEN
(quietly)
No one’s buying the novels, Shirl.
I have a chance here, to make a
real life -

SHIRLEY
You know what it costs.

She turns, walking away. Shaye moves to Steven, and puts her
arm around him as they watch Shirley go. Steven looks back
down at the manuscript on the table, the title page -

CUT TO:

INT. WALKER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven stares at the book for a moment, and then hands it to
Mrs. Walker.

STEVEN
I‘1ll write your story.

She blinks. Surprised.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
It’s a good story, Mrs. Walker. And
I researched your house - did you
know it was used as a hospice
briefly in the sixties?

MRS. WALKER
I didn’t.
53.

STEVEN

And I'd like to talk to you more
about your marriage, get some
background on Carl. Who he was, who
you both were. That’s what matters,
really. I’1l need to take some
liberties, I always do, but I
promise to be respectful.

(beat, encouraging)
He was a fan. I'll do it in a way
he would have really liked.

She nods. Steven stands, and begins packing up his equipment.

MRS. WALKER
You really didn’t see anything?

Steven frowns. He feels for her.

YOUNG HUGH (0.S.)
They didn’t see anything.

CUT TO:

INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE, THEN - AFTERNOON

YOUNG HUGH paces in the attorney’s office. Young Steven
watches on.

ATTORNEY
That’s not the point -

YOUNG HUGH
My kids don’t take the stand, Ross.
I’ve been clear about that.

YOUNG STEVEN
I had my eyes closed when we left -

YOUNG HUGH
Don’t say anything, Stevie.

ATTORNEY
No one else can corroborate your
story, Hugh!

YOUNG HUGH
That’s right.
54.

ATTORNEY
Look, the jury hears you talk about
packing five kids into your car at
three in the morning, they’re gonna
wonder why they aren’t hearing from
those kids! Not a single one -

YOUNG HUGH
Right. Not a single one.

ATTORNEY
The media’s already piling on, if
we don’t give them someone else to
write about, it’s gonna be more of
this -

He DROPS TWO TABLOIDS on the table in front of them. Steven
sees the headlines:

“Crazy Crane Claims Hill House Haunted”
“Hugh Crane Trial: Blames Ghosts for Wife’s Death!”
Steven looks up at his father. SEEING HIM DIFFERENTLY NOW...

YOUNG HUGH
We don’t engage.

ATTORNEY
They got this off your statement!
To the police!

YOUNG HUGH
I wasn’t thinking clearly that
night, we lean on that.

ATTORNEY
You can’t un-ring a bell -

YOUNG HUGH
Fine, they can rip me to pieces.
They don’t get to take bites out of
the kids.

ATTORNEY
Okay. We do it your way. It’d just
go a long way if I you’d let the
press near the house - hell,
they’1l pay you! They’d pay to walk
the grounds, take some pictures,
that money could help cover your
defense -
55.

YOUNG HUGH
No one goes near the house. The
cops have to, but no one else.

ATTORNEY

Then sell it, you need the money -
YOUNG HUGH

No.
ATTORNEY

Hugh... you’re saying you want to

keep the house your wife just died
in. Do you know how that looks?

Hugh shakes his head. This guy doesn’t get it...

YOUNG HUGH
I want the gates and doors locked.
I want the only keys. I want to
know, every day, that it’s empty.
No gardeners, no staff, no grounds
keeping.
(beat)
I want it to sit there and rot.

CUT TO:

INT. HUGH’S CAR, THEN - DAY

They drive. Young Steven looks up at his father from the
passenger seat. Stares at him. Hugh feels the gaze.

YOUNG HUGH
I’m sorry you had to hear that.

YOUNG STEVEN
What happened, dad?

Hugh doesn’t answer.

YOUNG HUGH
(long beat)
It’s going to be okay. I promise

you.

Steven stares at his father, realizing for the first time
that he DOESN'T BELIEVE HIM...

CLOSE on Young Steven, looking at the driver. We cut around
to his POV:

CUT TO:
56.

INT. STEVEN'S CAR -— DAY

STEVEN is driving. We’re now in his car, many years later.
The passenger seat is EMPTY.

He PASSES a sign: LOS ANGELES - 180 miles.
A VOICE from his car speakers:
VOICE
I’m sorry, there’s no Luke Crane at
our center. We can contact you if

he shows up.

STEVEN
I appreciate that. Thanks!

He reaches out, hanging up the call. Drives, frowning.
Considers... and then reaches out, hitting the SPEED DIAL
button on his console. Selects the first name on the list:
SHAYE.

It rings. After several rings, a woman’s voice picks up.

SHAYE
(long beat)
Hello.
STEVEN
Hey.

There's a beat between them. She’s waiting for him to speak,
he’s not sure what to say.

SHAYE
What do you want?

STEVEN
So my sister - there’s something up
with Nell, she may show up at the
house today.

SHAYE
(beat)
At my house?

STEVEN
At the house, yeah.

SHAYE
Why?
57.

STEVEN
My dad told her to, and I didn’t
get a chance to tell him what's...

She sighs. Steven looks down at the WEDDING RING on his
finger, gripping the steering wheel.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
I’m sorry, you can just point her
to me.

SHAYE
Is that all?

He shakes his head. Frustrated. He’s not sure what to say, he
could take this conversation in a few different directions,
and we sense him trying to pick the one least likely to
combust...

STEVEN
Maybe I can come by, and we can
talk about this some more?
Nothing.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
How long does this need to go on,
Shaye? You tell me what I have to
do, and I'll do it. I mean, I just
want to come home -
SHE HANGS UP.

He sighs. The road rolls forward in front of him... but the
traffic is SLOWING.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Great.

He slows. Ahead, down the rural highway, it’s BUMPER TO
BUMPER. An accident, most likely.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Just great.

He sits there, staring at the unmoving car. And at the TREES
beside the highway... some of the Northern California forest,
between the bigger cities.

He stares. Thinks.

Remembers...

CUT TO:
58.

INT. HILL HOUSE, THEN - DAY

The view of the woods, through a window. Another time, before
that night. Before the escape...

Reveal YOUNG STEVEN looking out at the trees... and at the
TREE HOUSE near the house.

Behind him, MARY PACES.
MARY
Luke? Luke! Has anybody seen your
brother?

Steven smiles, eyes on the tree house.

CUT TO:

EXT. HILL HOUSE, THEN - MOMENTS LATER

Steven crosses the yard, heading toward the tree house. Hand-
made, clearly with love, the structure itself sits on an
ancient tree, cradled by huge branches.

Steven climbs the ladder.

INT. TREEHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Steven POPS UP through the trap door. Nearby, coloring on the
floor, YOUNG LUKE (5) JUMPS.

YOUNG STEVEN
Mom's looking for you.

Steven starts to climb up. Luke goes back to coloring.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
Trying every closet. Every single
one. It never occurs to her you’ll
be in your tree house.
(beat)
The one dad built. For you.

Luke giggles.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
Dinner’s ready.

YOUNG LUKE
I don’t wanna go in yet, I don’t
like it inside.
59.

YOUNG STEVEN
I hear you.

Distant, we hear MARY'S VOICE calling, presumably out the
front door.

MARY (0.S.)
Luke?!

Luke sighs.

YOUNG STEVEN
No rush, my man.

He looks around. Lots of toys are scattered, and little Luke
has clearly been busy decorating.

Next to all the crayon drawings, Luke is hard at work on a
sign. He’s gotten a large N and O onto the paper.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
Whatcha making?

YOUNG LUKE
A new sign. How do you spell “no
girls allowed?”

YOUNG STEVEN
“yo 40",

YOUNG LUKE
I got those.

YOUNG STEVEN
“gr,

Luke starts the “G”.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
I told you last time, that’s a bad
idea. What happened to your other
sign?

YOUNG LUKE
Theo ripped it.

YOUNG STEVEN
I’‘ll bet. “I”.

He looks at the DRAWINGS, scattered around the floor.
Drawings of the FAMILY. Steven smiles.

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
Is this the family? “R”.
60.

Luke starts drawing the “R”.

YOUNG LUKE
Yep.

And then, begins to notice a trend. There are OTHER PEOPLE IN
THE DRAWINGS, TOO.

YOUNG STEVEN
Who's this?

YOUNG LUKE
Friend.

Steven looks closer. It’s a crude drawing, but there is
something striking about it. The eyes are just BLACK CRAYON
MARKS. The figure has no FEET.

YOUNG STEVEN
Your imaginary friends again, huh?

YOUNG LUKE
What’s next?

YOUNG STEVEN
“re

He looks at the drawings. There are several of them... it’s
easy to tell who the adults are, given their height. He can
see representations of the kids, too...

We notice THE CRUDELY DRAWN RED RECTANGLE in some of the
pictures... THE RED DOOR...

And then these other people. Tall. Grown ups. But less
color... and those black eyes...

YOUNG STEVEN (CONT’D)
You know I used to have imaginary
friends too. They go away when you
get bigger. “S.”

YOUNG LUKE
Okay.
(looking at his sign.)
No girls. Theo can’t rip this one,
it’s not allowed.

YOUNG STEVEN
I’1l tell her.

YOUNG LUKE
Will you hang out here though? With
me?
61.

YOUNG STEVEN
You want me to?

YOUNG LUKE
Yeah. That way it’s just the cool
kids. You, and me.

YOUNG STEVEN
Just us?

YOUNG LUKE
You can hang out in here all the
time. We could draw together, or
play whenever you want. No girls,
just Stevie and Luke.

YOUNG STEVEN
The cool kids.

Steven laughs. His smile fades a little. There’s something
about those drawings...

One of them really catches his eye. It almost looks like a
woman, but the dress is very large. RED SHOES on her feet.
But the striking thing is HOW BIG HER MOUTH IS...

A LARGE BLACK OVAL, TWICE AS LONG AS A MOUTH SHOULD BE, even
given the kid’s perspective...

OPEN IN A YAWNING SCREAM...
A CAR HORN, AS IF COMING FROM THE OPEN MOUTH -—

CUT TO:

INT. STEVEN'S CAR -— CONTINUOUS

THE CAR HORN startles Steven out of his reverie. Traffic is
moving again, slowly. He waves at the car behind him, pulling
forward.

He’s almost on the ACCIDENT SCENE. He slowly passes the
ambulance, lights flashing. The car, MANGLED.

It’s not even on his side of the highway. He’s been stuck in
traffic from the rubbernecking, that’s all.

He sighs heavily.
STEVEN

Everybody get a good look? Okay?
Can we go now?
62.

He and the other cars CRAWL past the scene, and get up to

speed again. THE PHONE RINGS, an incoming call.
On the console: RICHARD.
Steven accepts it.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Hey.

RICHARD
See any ghosts?

STEVEN
I've got a title: “The Leaking of
Walker Roof.”

RICHARD
Anything useful?

STEVEN
It used to be a hospice, there’s
stuff there. Maybe we find a few
more? Hospices turned residential?
Two more of those and I might have
something.

RICHARD
You don’t sound too excited.

He looks back in the mirror at the ACCIDENT SCENE behind him.

STEVEN
She gave me a great visual of a car
accident ghost - maybe we go that
way? Find some gnarly car
accidents, ghosts in the wrecks,
most haunted highways? Something
like that?

RICHARD
Haunted highways isn’t bad. You
know what I could really sell,
though?

Steven shakes his head. He knows exactly.

STEVEN
Hanging up now.

RICHARD
People want to know where you guys
are these days!
63.

STEVEN
No way, Richard.

RICHARD
None of your sales ever topped Hill
House. There’s so much interest -
your dad, your siblings, what the
house looks like today -

STEVEN
(thinks )
Bet it looks like shit.

RICHARD
It would sell.

STEVEN
Not interested. My family’s still
pissed about the first one. I do
another one, I won’t ever be able
to show my face again.
A sigh on the other end. They’ve done this before.

RICHARD
Think about it?

Steven HANGS UP.

CUT TO:

EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

LEGEND: LOS ANGELES

Steven steps out of his car outside of a DINGY APARTMENT
BUILDING, in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Grabs his bags from
the trunk, and heads in through the front door.

INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT, STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

The “lobby” of the building is really just a series of wall-
mounted mail slots, cracked tile floors, and the foot of an

old staircase.

This isn’t a place where someone lives - it’s a place where
someone squats, until the crisis has passed.

Steven DROPS his tripod, and it CLANGS noisily at the bottom
of the stairs.
64.

STEVEN
(frustrated)
Aw, fother mucker -

He grabs it, looking up the stairs -
AND FREEZES.

Standing at the landing, CLUTCHING an armful of odds and ends
is the STRUNG-OUT YOUNG MAN we met under the overpass.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
(sighs)
Hey Luke.

Luke (20's, no longer the little kid we knew) has clearly had
a HARD ROAD. Pale, sweaty. Thin. He looks like he’s been
sleeping on the streets.

LUKE
Hey Stevie.

Steven stares at him, nodding to himself. Looks at the things
Luke is CLUTCHING in his hands...

Odds and ends, some cash. An old CAMCORDER. An iPAD.

STEVEN
How'd you know where to find me?

Luke just stares at him. He seems CAUGHT.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Tell you what...

Steven drops his bags, reaching for his wallet. Luke watches,
a bit humiliated.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
I’ve got... let’s see. Two hundred
bucks here. You hand me that iPad,
you can keep the cash and you can
sell that old camera.

He points to the iPad.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
I need that iPad though. I’ve got
manuscripts on there, and some
personal things. Research, pictures
- it stays here.

Luke lowers his head. Ashamed.
65.

Silently, he moves down the stairs. He hands Steven the iPad,
and sheepishly takes the cash Steven holds out.

LUKE
I’m sorry.

STEVEN
I know.

Luke lingers. Somehow, this is worse than being yelled at.

LUKE
I just gotta square up and then I’m
good again, and I’m going back to
the clinic.

STEVEN
Good.

Steven makes no effort to stop his brother, just looks at him
sadly.

LUKE
And before you say anything about
rehab - I know what you’re gonna
say, and I don’t need -

STEVEN
I’m not saying a damn thing.

Luke blinks, a little surprised... and then heads to the
door.

Steven watches his brother go, vanishing into the streets. He
sighs. Looks down at the iPad in his hand, and picks up his
bags.

CUT TO:

INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Steven gets to his door. It’s OPEN a little, and we can see
the DAMAGE to the door frame from when Luke broke in.

STEVEN
Awesome.

He pushes the door open. Heads into the darkness of his
apartment.

CUT TO:
66.

INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

It’s a SMALL place, dark. COLORED LIGHT from an advertisement
near the window spills in, painting some of the shadows.

Steven drops his bags, hitting the LIGHT -
REVEALING NELL, standing in the living room.

STEVEN
(startled)
Jesus!

He laughs, shaking his head.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Thanks, I needed a good scare.

She stands still... her expression SAD.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Shaye booted you too, huh? I tried
to tell dad. We’re having some
issues, but - did you tell Luke
where I lived? You bring him here?

Nell doesn’t answer.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
You just stood here and watched him
loot me? Christ, Nell.

(beat)
So you hit up everybody. Dragged
Luke out, made Dad hop on a
plane...

He puts his hands on his hips.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Fine. You got us all listening.
What do you want? What’s so damn
important, Nell?

Nell looks up, making eye contact. She starts to MOVE HER
LIPS, but she doesn’t make a sound...

Steven’s PHONE RINGS. He looks down, lifting it out of his
pocket.

It's HUGH.
STEVEN (CONT'D)

Shit. I didn’t give him the
address...
67.

Behind him, he doesn’t see NELL’S ARM COME UP, POINTING JUST

OVER HIS SHOULDER.
He answers.

STEVEN (CONT'D)
Hey. I tried to tell you.

HUGH (0.S.)
Steve...
STATIC.

STEVEN

Dad?
HUGH (0.S.)

(static, broken up)

- bout - Nell -
STEVEN

Can’t hear you.
HUGH (0.S.)

(static)

«+. you hear me? I said it’s about

Nell.
STEVEN

I know, I just walked in and she -
HUGH (0.S.)

Nell was lying.
STEVEN

Shocking.
HUGH (0.S.)

She wasn’t in LA. She was... at

home, Steve.
He looks up at Nell.

HUGH (0.S.) (CONT'D)
She was at the house.

Steven stops, blinking. Smirks a little.
HUGH (0.S.) (CONT'D)

She... she killed herself. Around
three (static) morning...
68.

STEVEN
(beat, laughs)
What?
HUGH (0.S.)
Last night. At the house, Steve.
The goddamned house -
More STATIC.

Steven holds his breath. This doesn’t compute... he turns, to
look back where Nell was standing -

SHE'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. INCHES AWAY.
He DROPS THE PHONE.

HUGH (0.S.) (CONT'D)

(over the phone)
Steve? Steve, you there?

Nell STARES AT HER BROTHER. And just like Mrs. Walker said,
Steven doesn’t scream. He just stares back, a look of
CONFUSION on his face...
As her eyes SLOWLY ROLL UP INTO HER HEAD.

SILENTLY, SLOWLY. No fanfare, just... slowly ROLLING BACK,
until he can only see the WHITES OF HER EYES...

Steven doesn’t move. He doesn’t scream. His mind can’t even
PROCESS what he’s seeing... he just STARES.

And the RED VEINS spread across them...

HER SKIN CHANGES. STRETCHING, losing its color. BECOMING
WAXEN, GREY AND DEAD.

Her mouth SLOWLY DROPS OPEN... reaching its limit...
AND KEEPS GOING.

DROPPING LOWER AND LOWER, IMPOSSIBLY LOW...

A SOUND COMING FROM HER THROAT -

Like a SCREAM, but starting VERY FAR AWAY -
BUILDING IN INTENSITY AS HER JAW DROPS -

FINALLY BECOMING DEAFENING -—

Steven’s paralysis is broken. He SCREAMS, FALLING BACKWARD.
HITS the ground, looking back up -
69.

And just like that, NELL IS GONE. Like she was never there.

HUGH (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Steven? Steve?

Steven GASPS, catching his breath. Eyes wide and terrified.
The room is empty, and he is alone inside.

HUGH (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Steve?

FADE OUT.
