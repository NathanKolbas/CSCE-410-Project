“Pilot”

EXT, PARAGUAYAN TOWN - DAY (1948

A YOUNG BOY holding the reins to an ALBINO DONKEY covers his
head from the beating rain, watches an ancient bus wheeze to
a stop across the muddy road.

Super: San Bernadino, Paraguay, 1948.

NARRATOR (V.0.)

This is the story of four
superheroes.

(a tired sigh)
Four more TV superheroes. Just
what the world needs.

(a beat)
Be honest - have you hung yourself
yet?

A MAN in a suit and wide-brimmed hat steps from the bus, a

satchel slung over his shoulder. This is MR. MORDEN - 40s,
pale - clearly from away. Even the heavy rain can’t dampen
his mile-wide smile of expectation.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Our story begins with a man, not a
good man, not one of our heroes,
who simply wanted to become a
better bad man.

The Boy turns up the road with the Donkey (which wears a
DISTINCTIVE BRIDLE), whistles for Mr. Morden to follow.

EXT. PARAGUAYAN TOWN - VARIOUS — DAY (1948)

The Boy leads Mr. Morden through the town center, Morden
greets each face with a smile, gets stony stares in return.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
And his story begins, as most bad

mens‘ stories do -- with a visit to
a Nazi.

(correcting himself)
Cobbler.

THEY EVENTUALLY ARRIVE at a foreboding home. An imposing
VALET holds an umbrella over an older German man. This is
VON FUCHS - 608/70s, German, an ex-Nazi.

VON FUCHS
Mr. Morden.

MR. MORDEN
Yes, yes! You must be
Sturmbanhfuhrer Von Fuchs.

VALET
(re: Von Fuchs)
Martinez.

MR. MORDEN
Sorry?

VALET
Senor Martinez.

MR. MORDEN
Who?

VALET
The village cobbler.

MR. MORDEN
Oh?

(mow he gets it)

Ohhh.

Mr. Morden delights in their little secret. Von Fuchs and
the Valet just stare.

INT. VON FUCHS’ LABORATORY ~ DAY (1948

Von Fuchs leads Mr. Morden in. There are a multiple baroque
contraptions befitting a mad scientist of the era.

Mr. Morden grins, steps forth-- the Valet stops him. Mr.
Morden gets it -- they want to see payment. He opens his
satchel, displays contents we never see. But - as Von Fuchs’
eyeballs widen - we know it’s more than enough.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Von Fuchs was renowned for his
theoretical experimentation,
offering certain enhancements for a
price - a price Mr. Morden was more
than willing to pay.

Mr. Morden moves to gawk at what looks like a standing
isolation chamber, hooked up to various pumps and levers.

VON FUCHS
My finest invention. Designed
according to the Fuhrer’s most
demanding specifications.

CONTINUED:

MR. MORDEN
(quietly awed)
Herr Hitler himself used this?

VON FUCHS

Because I’d be hiding in this sixth
world hellhole if he had?

(then, a smile)
The Fuhrer died before its
completion. Meaning you could be,
should be...

(eyeing the satchel)
+ ethe very first.

INT. VON FUCHS’ LABORATORY — MOMENTS LATER (1948

Mr. Morden, wearing a specialized suit, steps into the
chamber. Von Fuchs shuts him in, steps to a control panel
where the satchel hangs. Von Fuchs dons a headset, pushes a
few buttons, pulls a few levers, compression tubes wheeze as—-

INSIDE THE CHAMBER ~ Mr. Morden is in a strange and wonderful
space. Sound drops away, time slows, as Von Fuchs’ VOICE
sounds tinny and echo-y over small speakers in the chamber.

VON FUCHS
Can you hear me, Mr. Morden?

MR. MORDEN
Yes!

But his voice sounds funny. Like he sucked heliun.

MR. MORDEN (CONT‘D)
Oh.

Which sounds different, too. He giggles. Which in itself
sounds funny. Which leads him to hysterics,

VON FUCHS
Are you ready, Mr. Morden!
MR. MORDEN
Ready!
VON FUCHS

Repeat after me, please. The.

MR. MORDEN
The.

As they speak, Von Fuchs pushes various levers and the
chamber begins to glow a blinding white.

CONTINUED:

The voices grow trippier and slower as Mr. Morden is driven
from hysterics to amazed euphoria.

VON FUCHS
Mind,

MR. MORDEN
Mind.

VON FUCHS

MR. MORDEN

VON FUCHS

MR. MORDEN

VON FUCHS

VON FUCHS (CONT‘D)
Again.

As Mr. Morden repeats the phrase, HIS LIPS SEEM TO DETACH
FROM HIS FACE, float in the whiteness, speak to him:

MR. MORDEN
The mind is the limit. The mind is
the limit. The mind is the - oh.
(hot damn...)
Funky.

As the LIPS SMILE and everything goes to WHITE and FUNKY, 60s-
style, THEME MUSIC kicks in and we go to TITLES:

DOOM PATROL

EXT, PANAMA CITY, FL — TACKY MANSION — DAY (1988
Godawful tacky piece of property. New money lives here.
Super: Panama City, Florida, 1988

NARRATOR (V.0.)

And now, to the 1980s. Somewhere
in this abomination of glass and
blow is a pale white ass pumping up
and down. Up and down. The ass of
a hero.

There it is. Mmm, smells like hero

CLIFF
Who's the fox?

GISELLE
You are.

EXT. GUESTHOUSE — DAY (1988)
Kate approaches the guesthouse. Growing suspicious.

KATE
Giselle?

INT. GUESTHOUSE — DAY (1988)
Giselle and Cliff keep pounding.

CLIFF
Who’s the fox?

GISELLE
(climaxing)
Oh - my - god...

EXT. GUESTHOUSE - DAY (1988)

Kate walks to the door, raises an arm to knock when -- the
door opens. Giselle, perfectly put together in her nanny
uniform, exits. Kate stares daggers. It’s mutual.

KATE
The baby’s crying.

GISELLE
Really? Looks fine to me.

Kate reacts -- huh? She whips around to see--
Cliff, dressed, with their now~calm daughter in his arms.

CLIFF
She’s fine, honey. You can’t be so
scared of her.

Giselle sashays past her to pluck the child from Cliff's
arms. And now they both face her, as if they’re the loving
couple. But Kate stares only at Cliff, who does his very
best to withstand her withering glare.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Behold, the bottom rung of
Marriage: contempt.

EXT. RACETRACK — DAY (1988

Cliff, in full racing attire, walks through the pit area
where he is adored by fans and crew. He is joined by his
crew chief, BUMP WEATHERS - 30s, Southern - on the way to his
car. Bump wears a shit-eating grin.

CLIFF
What?

BUMP
How in the hell’d you get Kate to
agree to her?

CONTINUED:

Bump’s talking about Giselle, who tends to Clara.

CLIFF
You’re a dirty old man, Bump.
(then)
It’s called trust. Thought you
woulda learned that by wife number
three.

They come to his race car, where Kate - playing the smoking
hot race car driver’s wife - awaits. Cliff leans in for a
perfunctory kiss, more for the crowd than anything, as Kate
whispers into his ear:

KATE
Crash and die, babe.

CLIFF
Love you too, honey.

Cliff waves to the adoring crowd, slips into his car and——

INT. CLIFF’S CAR/EXT. RACETRACK ~ DAY (1988)

We're racing! Cliff whips expertly around the track.
Maneuvers through a tight pack of other drivers.

BUMP (V.O.)
(through the comms)
Get to center, big fella.

CLIFF
Little snug getting there.
BUMP (V.0.)
How ‘bout you cry about it back in

the box?

Cliff smiles. Jerks the car center. Narrowly misses a guy
as he passes him.

CLIFF
Whoo! You see that! God-damn!

BUMP (V.0.)
(not talking to him)
Whoaaa. Hey, there...

CLIFF
What?

BUMP (V.0.)
Uh, nothing, Cliff.

BUMP
Hell, yes.

My god, sugar, don’t do that--

CLIFF
Bump?

Cliff tears into the straightaway, passes his pit crew and he
turns to check out what the hell is going on as--

TIME SLOWS. CLIFF‘S POV - Kate has draped herself around
Bump, her hand down his pants, stares directly at Cliff.

ON CLIFF. Time still slowed.

CLIFF (CONT‘D)
What the fuck!

As TIME SPEEDS UP, Cliff whips his attention back to the
track but he’s furious--

CLIFF (CONT'D)
You're fucking my wife!

BUMP (V.O.)
Cliff, I swear to god no-~

KATE

--oh, yes he is, guess what I never
have to say when I’m banging big
ol’ Bump?

CLIFF
Don't.

KATE

Cliff SCREAMS. Distracted, his front end taps the back of
the car in front of him, sets off a chain reaction --

CLIFF
Whoa. Whoa!

OVER BLACK -

An ANSWERING MACHINE BEEP. WE HEAR CLIFF’S TIRED VOICE and
the same message, a few times. Except we hear it in
different pitches, as if someone were playing with getting it
just right.

CLIFF (V.0.)

I don’t know what happened to us.
I'm going to be better.

A GLIMPSE -

CLIFF (V.0.)

There's an incongruous sound running beneath this image: THE
SOUND OF A BLOWTORCH.

INT. STEELE TRAILER — DAY — FLASHBACK (1983

Cliff and Kate, younger, poorer, happier, in their single-
wide. 80s ROCK BLARES, Kate dances around with a beer, Cliff
mixes Mac n Cheese, sliced hot dogs and barbecue sauce on the
stove. It’s all a little frantic:

CLIFF
TRAINWRECKS READY!

KATE
Wooooo!

Beneath all of it, that sound: THE BLOWTORCH.

INT. STEELE TRAILER - DAY - FLASHBACK (1986)

Cliff and Kate on the sofa, newborn CLARA sleeps on his
stomach, Kate’s head on his shoulder. They’re exhausted.

CLIFF

big-time race car driver.

CLIFF
Naw, I mean the important things.
(then, to Kate)
Do you think she knows how much I
dove you?

Weary chuckles. Which, after a beat, begin to SOUND like a
BLOWTORCH... as IMAGES OF A MAN IN A WELDING HELMET BEGIN TO
JARRINGLY CUT INTO THE MEMORY and we’re in--

INT. DOOM MANOR — CHIEF'S LAB - NIGHT (1989

AN UNKNOWN POV(CLIFF’S): A laboratory/machine shop. Vintage
machinery. Hand-tools. MUSIC BLARES, SPARKS FLY as a MAN
wearing a FLAME-DECALLED WELDING HELMET holds a BLOWTORCH and
makes a weld... somewhere around what would be Cliff's chin?

[A NOTE HERE: The POV is not crystal clear. It is grainy,
staticky, an imperfect video screen. ]

The Man stops abruptly. Flips up his mask, we see his face
for the first time. A bit wild-eyed, sweat-streaked, dirty,
he’s been at this for awhile. He stares in slight horror at
his mistake. This is DR. NILES CAULDER aka THE CHIEF.

NILES
Fudge.

INT. DOOM MANOR — CHIEF’S LAB — NIGHT (1992

CLIFF’S POV: What appears to be a MAN wrapped fully in
bandages sits slumped in chair in the corner of Cliff's field
of vision. Is he drunk? Dead?

A moment later, something else creeps into Cliff's POV, a
black, electrical mass that kinda sorta appears to be in the
rough shape of a human... and it’s definitely checking Cliff
out...

INT. DOOM MANOR - CHIEF’S LAB — NIGHT (1995

CLIFF’S POV: A BOWL OF POPCORN rests on... his stomach? He
can’t tell. The man who wore the welding mask - Niles -
sits on one side of him while a woman - elegant, a bit
haunted - sits on the other. This is RITA FARR.

They face away from him, watch a 1950s black and white
melodrama on the TV which appears to star... Rita Farr?
Niles and Rita are like an old married couple, acting out
this movie they’ve watched a million times.

RITA/TV RITA
I’m not sure you ever loved me,
Tom.

NILES/TV TOM
Of course I loved you. But I was
just never any damn good at showing
it.

RITA/TV RITA
You know what my father used to say
about smooth talkers like you?
Everything before the “but” is
baloney.

Dramatic music swells from the TV as TV Tom gives TV Rita one
last look and leaves. Niles pats Rita’s hand, knows watching
herself is always bittersweet.

NILES
You're experiencing something
called dissociative memory. After
a severe trauma, your brain only
lets you remember what it wants you
to remember. It’s a coping
mechanism.

CLIFF
Which makes no sense. Why would I
only remember the bad?

It will all come back. The bad and

RISE UP, through the smoke, to see ARMY VEHICLES racing at
them from across the field.

Whirr. Whirr. Up, back. Up, back...

Has anyone ever left this place?

NILES

Some have. Some come and go.
Others, like Larry and Rita, prefer

Larry, his horticulture. To be
perfectly honest with you, those
who leave find it’s often more

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Lovely, Rita. Queen of 50s cinema.
Some critics called her the poor

called her the rich man's Yvette
Vickers.

(another tired sigh)
Critics. What do they know?
They’re gonna hate this show.

And landing on our star, Rita, in early-50s explorer garb
with pith helmet. The cameras are rolling, she writes a

Rita glances at the camera crew, staring bullets at her.
There's a strapping new FOCUS PULLER. Shiny and whole.

Of course. It’s fine, it’s totally

She sinks into a deeper sinkhole, flails to get her bearings.
Claws at rocks on either side of her...

Watches the bubbling water. Nobody moves a muscle.

As crew members reluctantly spring into action--

The Wardrobe Gal approaches with a towel. Freaked.

What_are you staring at!

The Wardrobe Gal meekly produces a compact mirror. Shows
Rita her face... we just see a small piece, the side of her
eye seems to... droop? Rita takes the girl’s arm, directs
the mirror for a better look. As WE ARM AROUND T0 SEE--

Rita. Half her face, collapsed, like some monstrous candle-
dripping. It’s horrible.

The Wardrobe Gal begins to sob. The new Focus Puller begins
to retch... Rita, mortified, looks for escape... only to
realize her foot has swollen to grotesque proportions.

Still, she walks off, an ungainly shuffle, tears running down
her cheeks. Away from them all.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
And away she ran. Monstrous Rita.

Rita puts down her knitting. #nough is enough.

RITA
One step. So I don’t gut myself.

Cliff throws her a look. But -- a LITTLE GIRL’S LAUGH swings
his attention back to the steps. But-- where is ghe...?

LARRY
What is it, Cliff?

CLIFF

(after a beat)
I used to hold my daughter’s hands
when she was learning to walk,
she’d always want to go to the
steps, always wanted to go up. And
then she’d just stand there, and
I'd get so frustrated, you know?
Just walk up the steps. It’s the
most normal goddamn thing in the
world.

LARRY
So walk up the goddamn steps.

Cliff looks down at the steps, but now: they’re the steps
from home, and he sees his daughter CLARA between his legs,
arms outstretched, awaiting his help. Stunned, he pulls his
hands from the guardrails, gingerly takes hers, her fingers
on his robot fingers.

Cliff raises his left foot as she raises hers. Success.

And now the right... as she raises hers... yes...

Cliff can’t believe this is happening. He gives in to it--

then they can decide what to do

Thank you for everything you've

BUT: Cliff jerks the wheel at the last moment, narrowly
avoids being hit! Emerges from the pile-up untouched!

MOMENTS LATER. Cliff roars past the finish line in first!

He slows the car to a stop. Pops his helmet visor open, sits
there for a moment, shaken.

He’s yanked out of the car by his adoring pit crew. A MAGNUM
OF CHAMPAGNE is thrust into his hands as he spins to come
face to face with an also-shaken Kate.

For a brief moment we wonder if his near-death experience
will bring them together... but then he raises the magnum...
and proceeds to wallop the living shit out of Bump Weathers,
as the crowd falls into a stunned silence.

Cliff rears up, his face speckled with Bump’s blood, pops the
cork and sprays the shocked crowd while letting out a totally

Anyone ever tell you to shut your

CLANG! Jane/Hammerhead slams her multi~ringed hand right
where Cliff's loins would be... if he had any. She holds her
hand there, making her point. You’re no man at all.

JANE/HAMMERHEAD (CONT’D)
Little toybot does what?

SLAM! The door closes between them. Shut by Rita, who gives

Cliff a look -- see what I mean? But Cliff stands there a

Don’t you start with me, too. When
you and I both know this field trip
was for little more than your own
amusement.

Jane retreats - stung by the truth of that.

CLIFF
So now she’s the bad guy. Okay.
Let's talk about you, Chief.
(then)
You told me my daughter was dead.

Niles is taken aback.

NILES
I was trying to protect you.

CLIFF
By lying.

NILES
I'm trying to protect you now.
(then)
Do you honestly think she would
have accepted you?

CLIFF
Did I get a chance to try? She
lost her mother, her father, I
don’t know if she would have
accepted me. You robbed me of that
chance. What am I to her now? I‘m
nothing. I’m a monster.

A beat. Niles softens.

NILES

I assure you, there are many
monsters in this world, and none of
them - not a one - is you.

(then)
There are things out there I’ve
tried to warn you about. Many of
them, if I’m being totally honest,
might be considered my enemies.

(as this sinks in)
Who, if they found me, would not
hesitate - in any way ~ to destroy
me and those I love. And, yes, the
town if -- well, just because.

(then)
I've tried so hard to shield you.
And I know what I am asking of you.
To leave the safest place you've
ever known. To step out into a
world that would rather ignore you.
Shun you. Belittle you.

NILES (CONT'D)
But - if you stay here - if we die
now - this magical experiment, this
- you - my life accomplishments
all, it just --

 

His hands flutter in orbit for a lost moment -- it all dies.
CLIFF
Or. We stay. And we fight.
NILES
We could.
(then)

And we'd be doomed.

CLIFF
What are we now?

Both men’s words hang over the room.
LARRY
(after a beat)
I’m going to go with the Chief.
Larry exits.
RITA
Agreed.
(to Cliff)
You were good today, Cliff. And I
thank you.
She exits as well. All eyes on Jane.

JANE
Fuck it.

She exits. Cliff’s not sure what that means. Niles is.
A few moments later she returns, duffel in hand.
JANE (CONT'D)
(to the Chief)
Shotgun.
Jane walks out, no ceremony. Cliff stands there. Gut-punched.
EXT. ROAD — NIGHT (2018

Big, empty shot. Cliff walks along the side of the road.
Alone. Toward town.

Behind him, the Doom Bus pulls out, turns the opposite way.

INT. DOOM BUS ~ MOVING ~ NIGHT (2018

Quiet. Rita can’t help but watch Cliff’s receding figure.
Turns back, worried for him.

Niles gives her a small smile, This is the right thing.
Cliff recedes in the sideview mirror. Jane never looks.
EXT. TOWN ~— NIGHT (2018

The town is quiet. Nothing seems amiss. TWO TRASH HAULERS
throw debris into their truck. Cliff approaches.

CLIFF
Hey.
(then)
Seen anything weird?
The Trash Haulers stare.

INT. DOOM BUS - MOVING - NIGHT (2018)

Jane sings along to the tune on the radio, then falls silent.
Each of them has fallen off into their own thoughts.
Perhaps... second thoughts.

EXT, TOWN STREET — NIGHT (2018

Cliff walks.

INT. DOOM BUS - NIGHT (2018

dane drives. Her hand bangs anxiously against the wheel.
JANE

Anyone else think Cliff was right
about saving that town?

NILES
It's over, Jane. Let it go.
JANE
Okay, except I vote we turn around.
NILES
No.
JANE
Rita?

RITA
I can’t promise I won't, you know,
“blob out”, but - yes.

JANE
Larry?

Larry doesn’t answer, head in his hands.

RITA
Larry’s a yes.

JANE
Whoo!

Jane fishtails the bus into a turn.

EXT. TOWN — NIGHT (2018
Cliff walks. As the DOOM BUS pulls up alongside him.

ON THE DOOM BUS

Jane, Larry and Rita exit the bus. Rita hesitates. Shares a
moment with Niles.

NILES
This is wrong.

Rita gives him a small smile.

RITA
Might be. Probably is. We’1l be
back.

And she goes.
WITH CLIFF

Quietly moved as they approach. He gives them a small nod,
starts off again, toward town. They walk with him.

Rita’s leg swells - a sign of her anxiety - but Larry touches
her arm, gives her a nod. She smiles, gamely shuffles on.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
And there they go, our four lovable
losers, banding together to become
the superhero fighting force no one
Saw coming except everybody.
(then)
But. Fear not. Hope blooms.

NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
There’s a way out of this dreck,
follow me.

As our team marches on... and THE GROUND BEGINS TO RUMBLE...
ON THE DOOM BUS ~— INTERCUT
Niles reacts. Oh, no.

NILES
Paraguay.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Yes, Niles! Paraguay.

Niles turns to see a MAN that looks sort of like... Mr.
Morden? He’s half-man, half-nothing, of this world and not.
Also, he’s got a new name. He’s MR. NOBODY now. And he’s
apparently been our Narrator for this entire story.

NARRATOR/MR. NOBODY
Always, Paraguay.

NILES
Morden.

NARRATOR/MR. NOBODY
Sure. But no. I haven’t been Mr.
Morden since, well,
(mock screams)

“Ahh! Help me! WNoooo!”
We have no idea what he means. But Niles does.
WITH THE DOOM PATROL
As the ground rumbles around them--

RITA
It’s fine. It’s totally fine.

--Clip clop clip clop... That ALBINO DONKEY rounds a corner,
stops, looks at them askance. They stare back.

The Donkey farts white smoke. Which drifts up into the air,
forms into letters and words, like some twisted sky-writing.
The words float high above them:

THE... MIND... IS... THE... LIMIT...

They stare. Awed, unsure.

NARRATOR/MR. NOBODY (V.0O.)
I’ve been admiring your friends,
Niles, those freaks of yours, for
quite some time.

NILES
Don't you dare hurt them.

NARRATOR/MR. NOBODY (V.0.)
Hurt them? No. That wouldn't be
much fun, would it? Would be quite
the same old story, actually. I
think we’ll try something different
this time,

A MASSIVE RUPTURE OPENS IN THE STREET. UPENDS CARS, TILTS

BUILDINGS,

NARRATOR/MR. NOBODY (V.0.)
You were right about them in one
respect, however.

THE RUPTURE OPENS FURTHER - like something was opening a
zipper in the middle of town - HEADS RIGHT FOR OUR TEAM--

NARRATOR/MR. NOBODY
They are quite doomed.

--Growing bigger, more ferocious, more foreboding, as our
foursome stands in its path, unsure what they are looking at,
unsure what to do, AS WE--

CUT TO BLACK.
