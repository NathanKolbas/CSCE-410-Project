TRUE DETECTIVE
Chapter Two: ‘Seeing Things’

TITLE CREDITS.

BLACK.
COHLE (V.0.)
Back then, not sleeping. I’d lay in
the dark. I’d think about women. My
wife. My daughter.
FADE IN:

INT. COHLE FAMILY APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DAY

A YOUNG COUPLE on a bed, with a year-old BABY between them.
Light diffuses through thin curtains over a large window as
the young parents delight in the child, playing with her.
Rustin Cohle, 26, with his WIFE and daughter--

COHLE (V.0.)
Who knows why we choose the ones we
do? Some just have your name on
them. Like a bullet. Or a nail in
the road.

Off the happiness of the parents and their baby--
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

The established interview room- old table, bulletin board,
institutional walls. RUSTIN COHLE, 51, sits before us, three
BEERS into his six pack, cigarettes beside a mug. The flame-
and-dice TATTOO visible on his forearm, he speaks into the
camera, drinks, smokes--

COHLE
...-Sorry. I drift when I have a
few. S’why I like to drink alone.

He finishes the can--

COHLE (CONT’D)
Still won’t tell me about the new
one..? Alright. None of my
business, you guys don’t want to
fill me in.

He waits a beat, watching his questioner, pops open a new
beer--
COHLE (CONT’D)
None of my business, you tell me
you lost most of our old files ina
basement flood...

I/E. CID CAR, MOVING - DAY

ON a black, unmarked CID car cruising through the Ozark
foothills. Rust Cohle, 31, rides passenger as MARTIN HART,
36, drives them into a frosty, rural landscape, pine-covered
hills marked with dirt driveways, trailer parks and
ramshackle homes, dense woods and hazed mountains in the
distance. Dollops of SNOW spotting the edges of things--

HART (V.O.)
We dug up the victim’s mother after
talking to her ex in Pine Bluff.
Piece of work, that guy.

EXT. LEWIS HOME, OZARKS - DAY

A dilapidated CINDERBLOCK BUNGALOW with corrugated metal
roof, its small yard a tangle of knee-high weeds and debris.
Cardboard covers one of the front windows. Cohle and Hart
step out their car in the high grass, move toward the house--

EXT. LEWIS HOME, FRONT DOOR - DAY

A WOMAN, 60s, opens a plywood front door for the detectives.
She's thick, stone-faced with her thin gray hair pulled into
a greasy pony-tail, a tent-like house dress making a solid
mound of her. From the darkened doorway she squints upward at
the detectives, into the daylight--

INT. LEWIS HOME, OZARKS - DAY

Rust, Martin, and the WOMAN (ELLEN LEWIS), sit on ancient
furniture in a cramped LIVING ROOM. Ellen is weeping, wiping
her eyes as Rust and Martin exchange a glance--

They look around the house, NOTICE a very old TV in one
corner, and in another, a VOTIVE KNEELER before a STATUE of
the Virgin Mary, the statue framed by flea-market PORTRAITS
of Christ and the Madonna. Cast iron STOVE, makeshift chimney
with ash gathered beneath it in a pile. On a shelf, a few
family PHOTOGRAPHS--

HART
Far as helping us find out what
happened, Mrs. Lewis. Maybe you
could remember the last time you
saw your daughter?

Ellen dabs at her eyes with a rag--
ELLEN
It'd be... maybe a month, I think.
Last time. She brought me some
supper.

COHLE
She call since then?

ELLEN
I- I don’t have a phone.

Ellen turns to the kneeler, the portraits above it--

ELLEN (CONT’D)
Bright Lady! What else do you
want?!

She breaks down again, gathers herself. Meanwhile Hart looks
uncomfortably at Cohle, but Rust’s eyes are tracking details
of the house--

Soot-stains on the low ceiling, dirt, dust, old newspapers.
ON the row of PHOTOS on the shelf-- a young girl that must be
DORA LANGE, wearing an inscrutable expression. In one photo,
she’s about twelve, and a MAN stands behind her, shadowed--

COHLE
Mrs. Lewis... how about her father?
Did they have a relationship?

ELLEN
Him? Why? What did she say?

HART
No, Mrs. Lewis, we're asking if
he’s around, if they were close.

ELLEN
Why wouldn’t a father bathe his
child?

Glances between the partners and Ellen--

COHLE
...Is your husband here? Can we
talk to him?

She becomes solemn, shakes her head, sets her jaw proudly--

ELLEN
Died on the road. Drove a
Peterbilt, rolled over when he took
an exit too fast. Outside of Rowan,
Oklahoma. May 11th, 1984.
COHLE
What about the last time you saw
Dora? What was she like-- how’d she
seem, I mean?

ELLEN
...-She’s had a little trouble. But
I thought there'd be time yet, for
her. I waited. She said she’d
started going to church. Said she'd
been talking to a priest--

She chokes. Detectives exchange looks, Hart re-taking lead--

HART
She have any specific reason for
seeing you, last time she came
around?

ELLEN
.»-No. No, she said she just hadn’t
been by in awhile. Brought me
spaghetti... She knows I don’t have
any money, if that’s what you mean.

HART
How about her ex-husband, Charlie
Lange?

ELLEN

Him? He’s in prison.

HART
You get along with him?

ELLEN
...They both growed up together...
They always want more, you know,
kids... How do you keep them from
wanting what’s bad for them?..
Why’d the Lord make people this
way? That we can only want what
hurts us?

They give her some space with her desperation, then--

HART
...She seem to be doing alright,
last time you saw her?

ELLEN
She seemed alright. Yes. A little
happier. More positive. I was glad
she'd been talking to a priest.
At once, Ellen clutches her head, grimaces as if in the
throws of a terrible migraine. She groans. Hart moves to her
side--

HART
Mrs. Lewis?

ELLEN
..-My headaches. I get storms...

NOTICE Rust continues watching her interaction with Hart
impassively, almost coldly. Gradually, she pushes out of the
pain--

ELLEN (CONT’D)
Worked at a dry-cleaners twenty
years. Now I get headaches. I had
to handle all these chemicals for
such a long time. That’s what’s
wrong with my nails--

She holds out her hands, shows her NAILS; they’re yellow and
gnarled, fungal, and the ends are soft and rotted off--

Creepsville. Off Cohle and Hart’s look to one another--
INT. CID CAR, MOVING - DAY

ON the detectives’ car as it travels southward on Highway 71,
through the wintry geography of the Ozark foothills. Hart
drives, Rust sits back, staring ahead, thinking to himself--

Hart clocks Rust in thought, and as if the silence bothers
him--

HART
Piece of work, right? My mother,
Donna Reed type. Hot meals. Lunches
packed.

Rust doesn’t respond--

HART (CONT’D)
++-Your mom still alive?

COHLE
.»..-I guess so.

The answer jabs Hart, Cohle’s indifference taken as an
inchoate stab against family values. Cohle doesn’t engage him
further, keeps thinking to himself. Visibly annoyed, Hart
turns back to the road--
HART (V.O.)
My parents?

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
MARTIN HART, 56, suited, robust, speaks to his interviewers--

HART
My father, you know, I had about
six inches on him, and even when he
got old, I’d still say he could
take me... Cobbler. Sold shoes.
Made shoes. Navy in World War Two.
Swam to North Africa when his PT
Boat went down...

There is a kind of boyish pride in Hart’s tale, informed by a
matrix of private inflations--

HART (CONT’D)
He was tough. But fair. You always
knew where you stood with him...
Cancer. ‘95. Mom passed a couple
months after him. Married forty-two
years.

A conservative idealization of marriage and parenting is
discernible in Hart’s recollection. He watches the camera as
though being asked a question--

HART (CONT’D)
No. Rust’s mom lived somewhere out
West, and he didn’t talk about his
Dad... To me, looking back, the
family stuff... I think part of
Rust’s problem was that he needed
things he wouldn’t admit to.

On that succinct analysis--

EXT. GAS STATION / CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

ESTABLISHING-- a rural GAS STATION surrounded by desolate
fields and dark forest, snow-dappled. Tires, car parts,
junkyard effluvium. NOTICE the black CID CAR parked at the
entrance--

INT. GAS STATION / CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

FOLLOW along the store counter, its pornography and tobacco

and cheap impulse buys, to the end, where Cohle and Hart
stand over a store ATTENDANT, CARLA EUSTICE--
She's large, corn-fed and plain, wearing a work vest and
sitting in a chair at the end of the counter, crying as the
detectives look down. Though on duty, she drinks from a fresh
40 OZ. of malt liquor--

CARLA
--And the worst is that I had a
feeling. Like maybe something was
wrong with Dora and I should call
her--

Carla looks to Cohle and Hart for assurance. A ribbon of
TATTOOED STARS winds out of her collar and halfway up her
neck--

COHLE
You remember the last time you
talked to her, Carla? Last time you
saw her?

CARLA
She came by my place. She needed
somewheres to crash, and I let her
spend the night... Charlie needed
some cash. I told him she wouldn’t
be able to help, but I gave her the
message. Told her to call him.

COHLE
She was homeless?

CARLA
No, not the way she said it. She
seemed, it don’t matter now, but I
guess she’d gotten into the christy
again. Or something. She said it
was just for the night. I hadn’t
seen her in a long time, and I
could tell things were hard on her.
I shoulda helped out more. I had a
feeling...

HART
You clean, Carla?

Carla's eyes dart. She shrugs, almost ashamed, drinks--

COHLE
Don’t worry about that. What’d she
say to you? How was she?

CARLA
Thin. Loopy, like I’m saying. On
something...

(MORE )
CARLA (CONT'D)
Oh- like this nursery rhyme? I woke
up in the night cause I heard her.
She’s curled on the couch. Blanket
pulled up. And she was repeating
this rhyme... I think I’d heard it
before. Something like, ‘I met a
man on the stairs, but he wasn’t
there or anywheres.’ I don’t know.
Weird. I went back to bed.

COHLE
...’Yesterday upon the stair, I met
a man who wasn’t there... He wasn’t

there again today.’

CARLA
That’s it.

COHLE
...’I wish, I wish he’d go away.’

She looks between the two detectives, Hart watching Cohle for

explanation--

COHLE (CONT’D)
It’s a poem. Antigonish.

Hart slightly baffled, back to Carla--

HART
You have any idea where she
might’ve been staying? Landlord at
her last address said she moved out
about a year ago.

CARLA
Yeah. No, she moved out of there.
She might’ve had a fella for
awhile? There’s this, like, women’s
shelter? It’s outside Fayetteville,
um, up near the highway before
Springdale. I know she went there
sometimes. Where the Wal-Mart is.

HART
How far back you and Dora go, as
friends?

CARLA

Since junior high.

HART
You knew her father?
Carla drinks--

CARLA
...You gonna ask about the baths?

Cohle and Hart show no reaction. A beat as Carla hits her 40--

CARLA (CONT'D)
...-I can sense things sometimes...
Do you- do you think I knew this
was going to happen to Dora..?

 

She looks between the two cops, pleading for acquittal--
Cohle just shrugs--
INT. CID CAR, MOVING - DAY

Late afternoon. Hart drives as Cohle watches out the window,
always observing the icy landscape. FROST covers the glass,
and light ripples and bounces off the ice--

Cohle’s POV FX: a small BIRD appears within the frost,
flickering, its wings rising to the light, flapping once
before it evaporates to runny ice on the glass--

Almost a trick of the light--
ON COHLE, shutting his eyes hard, as if fighting the vision--

COHLE
...We’re doing this wrong.

HART
Your expert opinion.

COHLE
We're trying to learn more about
her. We should be trying to learn
more about him.

HART
There’s nothing to go on with him.

COHLE
Hits up prosts. Self-hating.
Artistic. Possibly trained in
taxidermy. Religiously inclined.

HART
Every person within a thousand
miles is religiously inclined.
10.

COHLE
(to self)
...Unless... was he mocking?

Hart watches Cohle sort through his own thoughts--

HART
Listen, I can appreciate a kind of
academic model you’re adding here--

COHLE
She sounds sad, Marty. A tired,
ripped-up person on her last legs.
Made her a good target for our man,
but it wasn’t personal. Prost yards
would be his hunting grounds. We
should be on that, put Demma and
Lutz on victim background.

HART
Ninety-five percent of murders are
committed by someone the victim
knows.

COHLE
And in what percentage of those
murders does the DB have wings
soldered to their back?

Hart scowls, doesn’t retort, acknowledging the point--

COHLE (CONT’D)
I’m telling you, there’s a scope to
this. A vision. She was just chum
in the water. We should be working

on methodology.

The car passes out of frame, but the camera lingers on the
ice-laced hills under a deep gray sky, as though they watched
us back--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Martin Hart, 56, speaks to the camera--

HART
...Well, you're looking for a
narrative. That’s the job. You’re
just trying to find the story that
fits. Crime scene protocols.
Interrogate potential witnesses.
Parcel evidence. Talk to people.
Talk to everybody. Establish a
timeline. Build a story... Days.

(MORE )
11.

HART (CONT'D)
Weeks. That’s still how it’s done,
yeah..? You talk to people.

Off his point--
INT. PLATINUM CABARET, SPRINGDALE - DAY

Inside an empty STRIP CLUB where a homely woman gyrates
lethargically on a pole for no audience. A MANAGER (40s)
speaks to Cohle and Hart near the bar. The Manager holds a
PHOTOCOPY of Dora Lange’s mug shot--

MANAGER
Gave her a couple day shifts. She
only showed up for one. Wasn’t good-
looking enough to put up with that
kind of shit.

ON Cohle, scrutinizing the man’s face as he hands back the
mug shot--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Rustin Cohle, 51, semi-relaxed with his beer--
COHLE

You fill in blanks. Try to account
for the state of things using

objective correlatives... Like
historians, writing a secret
history. ...That’s why you’re

talking to me, yeah?

On the slightest sense that he knows something his
interviewers don’t--

EXT. WOMEN’S SHELTER, ARKANSAS - DAY

Day shading toward evening. A small brick BUILDING in a
rundown patch of county between Fayetteville and Springdale,
Arkansas. Cohle and Hart stand at the front door, looking up
at a sign which reads ‘ST. JOHN’S HOUSE OF WOMEN’ - ‘Love and
Shelter abide Within’--

COHLE
Next on our tour of female
tragedy...

INT. WOMEN’S SHELTER, KITCHEN - DAY
Inside the home’s KITCHEN, Cohle and Hart stand before a

casually-dressed NUN (60s) and FOUR WOMEN, aged 25-40, who
share TWO PHOTOCOPIES of Dora Lange’s mug shot between them.
12.

Dishes and food suggest that the Nun was directing the women
in preparing dinner prior to the detectives’ entrance. The

WOMEN seem reticent in the company

NUN
Yes. She’s been here.
around of late--

Ha:

WOMAN 1

of the police--

sn’t been

Maybe two weeks? Think that’s the

last time I saw her.

WOMAN 2
She just come for dinner
times. I don’t think she
here.

NUN

a few
stayed

No. She didn’t stay here.

HART
You all maybe know where
stay?

The women look between each other,

NUN
A lot of the women come
here, they don’t have pe:
places.

she did

shake their heads--

through
rmanent

The Nun puts down the photocopy and returns to preparing

dinner--
WOMAN 3
..-I talked to Dori befo:
WOMAN 1
Me too.
HART

Anybody know if she had
boyfriend, a man?

The woman glance at one another--
WOMAN 3

--She had a husband in
Bluff, I think.

NUN
.-She asked me before,
taking vows.

about
13.

NUN (CONT'D)
She once asked me what it meant,
being a bride of Christ. I remember
that...

The Nun moves to put a dish in the oven--

NUN (CONT'D)
Not a serious inquiry, you
understand... Something’s happened

to her, yes?
She and the other women face the detectives--

NUN (CONT'D)
Happens now and then. Men of your
vocation come see us. Ask
questions.

She makes the sign of the cross--

NUN (CONT'D)
(to girls)
We'll hold a mass for her, Sunday.

The women nod to one another grimly--
I/E. WOMEN’S SHELTER, ARKANSAS - DAY

FOLLOW the Nun as she leads the detectives out. Cohle and
Hart clock the features of the home as they walk-- everything
old but immaculately clean, shelves full of books, many of
them more progressive than one might expect, WOMEN appearing
and shrinking back into doorways at their presence--

NUN
Usually ten to fifteen here at one
time. No room for more than that.
Get more for the meals. I’1l pass
Dora's picture around.

HART
And you got our cards. Anybody
remembers anything, ring us up.
Totally anonymous.

COHLE
Anything at all. No matter how
irrelevant it seems.

She opens the door and the two detectives step outside--
14.

NUN
A lot of the women here have
problems trusting men... I’1l do

what I can.

COHLE
They can trust us.

The Nun looks over Cohle and seems flatly unimpressed. She
just steps back, watching him as though she glimpsed a
threat, shutting the door--

Cohle and Hart walk back to their car--

HART
You got a way with folks, Rust.
They warm up around you.

COHLE
I make friends and influence
people.

They climb in the car--
INT. ARKANSAS STATE CID - NIGHT

Back in the HOMICIDE DIVISION of the State Police. DETECTIVES
milling about (DEMMA, LUTZ, GERACI, FAVRE). LT. QUESADA
talking on the phone--

HART (V.O.)
See what the other boys had before
we called it a day.

Hart and Cohle enter the squad room, acknowledged by the
RECEPTIONIST. They walk through the division toward the BIG
BOARD established for the Dora Lange Case--

Demma and Geraci approach Hart--

DEMMA
Landlord said she moved out a year
ago. Lost the deposit. Never heard
from her. Neighbors check out. Only
ones remembered her said she used
to come home in the mornings. A
lot.

Demma’s eyes are a little glazed, and he and Geraci display
the barest physical signs of inebriation--

HART
Thanks.
15.

COHLE
(sniffs)
You two canvas the bars pretty
heavy?

GERACI
Up your ass, Cohle. Do your own
legwork, you rat fuck.

COHLE
What’d you call me?
GERACI
S'what’s going on here, right?
(re Cohle)
Company Man here’s working CID for

the Feds.
Cohle puts his finger in Geraci’s face--

COHLE
One time. Say it again rummy.

Geraci lunges at Cohle, who side-steps and bitch-slaps the
back of his head. Then Hart and LT. QUESADA are between the
two, shoving them apart--

QUESADA
What the hell is this?!
HART
(to Geraci)

Goddamnit, Jerry. Go home.
Geraci backs down, straightens his tie--

GERACI
Nothing, Loo. Breaking balls.

Hart looks at Cohle, who’s eye-fucking Geraci. NOTICE that no
one likes matching stares with Cohle for very long. Geraci
and Demma walk out the squad room, snide--

GERACI (CONT'D)
New kid likes talkin out the side
of his mouth.

Quesada stays with Hart and Cohle, awaiting explanation. But
LUTZ and FAVRE approach, Lutz reading from his notepad--

LUTZ
Got a couple hits from working
girls. Nothing special.

(MORE )
16.

LUTZ (CONT'D)
Nobody close to her. Few names
recognized her as an occasional.

FAVRE
Like she tricked only now and then.
Show up at a couple truck stops
when she needed the cash. Got the
names of which ones.

HART
Right.
QUESADA
(to Cohle and Hart)
What about you two? You get
anything today?

Cohle and Hart look at one another, mutually acknowledging
failure--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
Martin Hart, 56, speaking to the camera--
HART
Few days like that. We ask around,
talk to other working girls. Talk
to her former employers...

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

A large grocery store where the MANAGER (40s) speaks to the
two detectives--

MANAGER
Had her on checkout. She quit after
a few months. No notice.
He shrugs, returns to stocking cans on a shelf--

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Hart and Cohle sit at a booth with ANNE (30s), whose
appearance suggests a cut-rate streetwalker--

ANNE
She told me about where she came
from. Her dad... But I never knew
her that close. Sorry to hear what

happened.

Cohle rubs his eyes as though he has a headache--
17.

INT. COHLE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Early morning, cold, windows frosted. Rust Cohle rises to
start his day. His bed is a mattress on the floor, surrounded
by books. No furnishings. A crucifix on the wall. FOLLOW him
to a narrow bathroom, it’s mirror as he stares at himself:
sleep-deprived, hollow-cheeked--

COHLE (V.0.)
Days of nothing. That’s what it’s
like, yeah? You work cases...

INT. HART HOME, BEDROOM - DAY

Early morning. In his big bed with his WIFE, MAGGIE, Hart is
happily woken by his TWO DAUGHTERS running into the room,
bouncing on the bed. Embraces, tickling--

COHLE (V.0.)
You talk, you listen, look for
something to break. Days of
searching. Like lost dogs...

On the groggy, familial joy of Hart’s morning wake-up--
INT. TAXIDERMIST - DAY

A MAN (50s) stands behind the counter inside a Taxidermist’s,
stuffed, mounted ANIMALS clogging the walls all around, game
animals- deer, duck, quail, a bear’s head. Cohle and Hart
stand on the other side, asking the MAN a question, dialogue
only voice-over--

COHLE (V.0.)
Talked to something like ten
taxidermists. Nobody had ever done
a turkey vulture, much less sold
one.

The Taxidermist shakes his head to answer their question--
INT. CID CAR, MOVING - DAY

Hart drives while Cohle looks over the NOTES that fill the
big legal tablet he uses. Hart watches him peripherally, the
portfolio spread across his lap--

HART
Hey. Other night, you were over for
dinner... Why didn’t you go home,
when I had Chris call for you?
18.

COHLE
...-I don’t know. I guess I'd
sobered up. And it wasn’t as bad as
I thought, meeting your family. I
liked talking to them.

HART
‘Bad’? Why’d you think it’d be bad?

COHLE
I didn’t. Look--

He closes his portfolio, sighs--

COHLE (CONT’D)
I was married, Marty. Three years.
We had a baby girl. She died, two
years old. Car accident. Marriage
couldn’t handle it.

HART
Shit, man. I’m sorry. Sorry to hear
that. I didn’t--

COHLE
S'alright. It was just me, not you
guys. I was worried... being around

that kind of thing...

After a beat, Rust goes back to looking at his notes, and
Martin glances at him from the corner of his eyes, a new
sympathy in his appraisal--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

51, Rust Cohle smokes, listens to his interviewer. Perhaps
slightly buzzed, he speaks a little discursively when he
answers--

COHLE
Yeah. Just married once. Came close
another time. That was later on.
Marty introduced us. She broke it
off. For the best. I gave her
cause... I can be hard on people.

He puts his cigarette out, thinks, sips his beer. In an oddly
confessional outpouring--

COHLE (CONT’D)
I can pick people apart. I don’t
mean to. But I can be critical. I
have problems getting angry...
(MORE )
19.

COHLE (CONT’D)
I’ve had the thought before that
I’m not good for other people. Like
it’s no good for them to be around
me long. I wear them down. They
become unhappy. I don’t mean for
that. But life works its way
through you... I can’t say the job
made me this way. More like, me
being this way made me right for
the job. I don’t know. I used to
think about it a lot. Not so much
now. You reach an age and you
understand who you are...

A beat as he stares into the camera, unable to fully hide the
pathos in his eyes--

COHLE (CONT’D)
It’s better now. I live in a little
room out in the country. Tend bar
four nights a week. In between I
drink, and there’s nobody around to
make me stop. Which is good. I
understand who I am. After all
these years... There’s a victory in
that.

Cohle’s flat gaze carries no sense of achievement--
INT. ARKANSAS STATE CID - NIGHT

The HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM, fairly empty. NOTICE the BIG BOARD,
and how little evidence has been added to the Dora Lange
case. At their desk, Cohle is typing up the Daily Log--

ACROSS THE ROOM Hart speaks softly into the phone, trying not
to be heard--

HART

(into phone)
No, babe. I understand. Of course I
want to be there... It’s just the
case got moving, I needa follow
something up tonight... Listen, you
tell her Daddy’s proud, and I'1l
see it next time... Alright, sorry.
I love you.

Marty hangs up. Walks across the room to where Cohle is
typing--

HART (CONT’D)
You alright doing the DL? I got
somewhere to be.
20.

COHLE
Boy's night at Glory Holez?

HART
Nice. Audrey's piano recital.

COHLE
Sure. Go on.

HART
Thanks.

Hart grabs his jacket and makes for the exit while Cohle
regards him with a slight suspicion--

INT. SCARLET O’S TAVERN - NIGHT
A mid-scale bar, dim, mostly attended by adults or the middle-

aged. Hart stands at the bar with Demma and Lutz, all three
drinking boilermakers--

HART
10 to 1 we never get this guy.
LUTZ
You're giving yourself too much
credit.
HART
Don’t let Cohle hear you say that.
DEMMA
Fuck Cohle. He called my man Geraci
incompetent.
LUTZ

Steve is incompetent.

DEMMA
You know he’s ex-DEA or something?
S'why Willey forced him on our
division. The feds are running
something.

HART
No, no. See, that’s you all
starting shit, Chris. Bullshit
rumor. Quesada already talked to
him about it.

DEMMA
What a relief.
21.

The BARTENDER delivers three whiskey shots to the men, who
all toast and throw them back. Hart starts moving away--

LUTZ
Where you going?

HART
Make a call.

INT. SCARLET O'S TAVERN - NIGHT

In a dark hallway, Hart leans against the wall, using the PAY
PHONE--

HART
(into phone)
Alright if I drop by..? Scarlet
O’s... No I’m not. I barely had
anything to drink... Leave the door
unlocked?

He hangs up the phone, straightens his jacket. FOLLOW as he
walks back to the bar, the barest hint of conflict in his
features--

HART (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I did. I enjoyed being married.

When Cohle rejoins his buddies, he quickly fakes a grin--
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Hart, 56, speaking to his interrogators--

HART

I mean, sure, you miss some things,
being a cop. And yeah, I probably
could have worked it better than I
did. But you know how it is. Things
you see... You gotta decompress
before you go being the family man.
I mean, what’s in your head, you
can’t have the kids around it...

A beat--

HART (CONT’D)
I’m saying, sometimes you’re not in
a position to listen to twenty kids
trying to play ‘chopsticks.’ This
for my wife, too. She doesn’t want
to be around me when I’m this way,
juiced on a case.

(MORE )
22.

HART (CONT’D)
So sometimes you go have a drink
instead of going home... A tiny
lie, as those things go. The kind
that keeps the peace.

EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX, SPRINGDALE, AR - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING- a set of manufactured CONDOS in a suburban area
north of Fayetteville. Hart’s CAR parks at the curb. He
climbs out, starts walking to a door--

HART (V.O.)
I mean the first lesson of
adulthood is compromise, right?

EXT. LISA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Hart has just knocked on a door, and it opens onto LISA
TRAGNETTI, 26, dark-haired and sexy in shorts and a loose T-
shirt. She smiles at Marty, who holds up a bottle of RUM.
Lisa rolls her eyes as she steps aside for him to enter--

INT. LISA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ON a STENOGRAPH MACHINE, parked in one corner outside the
living room at a desk with a stack of paper (this telling us
Lisa is a court reporter). MOVING into the living room,
fairly tasteful, relatively cheap furnishings. A COFFEE TABLE
where the bottle of RUM stands--

A TELEVISION shows continuing coverage of the Exxon Valdez
oil spill--

Martin sits back on the couch as Lisa enters from the kitchen
with two glasses of ice and a liter of Coke--

She starts to make the drinks, bending over in front of
Marty, who reaches out and slides his hand up her shorts--

HART (V.O.)
...That was part of Rust’s problem,
like I’s saying. A man needs a
family.

She turns around and they start kissing, Martin yanking her
shorts down--

TIME CUT:
INT. LISA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The drinks sit untouched on the coffee table, ice melted.
Lisa lies on the couch with Marty, wearing only her T-shirt.
23.

Hart’s in his boxers and undershirt, running fingers through
her hair--

HART
...What’d you do last night? I
called up here late.

LISA
What were you doing?

HART
Working. Thought about dropping by.
Where were you?

LISA
Out with girlfriends.

Marty stops fondling her hair--

HART
-+--I don’t like that.
LISA
What? You're jealous?
HART
Don’t be stupid. I mean... there’s

crazy people out there. A man
killing young women.

LISA
..-Are you talking about that girl
in Benton county again? In the
paper?

HART

(lying)
...Not just her. There’s more.

LISA
More? Really?

HART
We're not saying. Keeping it out of
the press. But we’re thinking he’s
been doing it awhile. Still doing
it.

LISA
Oh. Wow. Jeez.

HART
There’s no need to be going out.
Have a drink at home.
24.

LISA
I can’t meet a nice man at home.

HART
That hurts me, see, when you say
that. When you speak to me ina
passive-aggressive way. I always
talk straight with you.

LISA
Oh, excuse me. I meant, since
you're married, I need to be
considering my options as a young
woman. I want things Marty. This is
okay. But it won’t last on.

HART
I want things, too.

Lisa shakes her head, leans away, reaching for her drink--

LISA
You just want your cake and to eat
it, too.
Marty moves to her--
HART

What the hell good is cake if you
can’t eat it?

He buries his face in her ass. She gasps, sets down the drink
and closes her eyes--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Rust Cohle, now on his last beer, telling his story--
COHLE
Me? I told you. I didn’t sleep.
Most nights I’d read manuals.
Study. Go over case stuff...
He drinks--
COHLE (CONT’D)
Other times I’d just lie in the
dark. Think about women.
INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A cheap, cramped STUDIO apartment by the railtracks, the
single room cluttered with loose clothing, fast food bags.
25.

A BED takes up most of the space, festooned with STUFFED
TOYS, plush animals for which the WOMAN on the bed is much
too old--

Lucy (20s, the prostitute Cohle met in ep. 1), sits cross-
legged on the bed, a few baggies of PILLS in front of her,
prescription bottles without labels. Rust Cohle, 31, stands
at her window, exhausted, looking out at a streetlight in an
alley--

LUCY
You wanted blues?

COHLE
Qualludes. The dopey stuff.

He turns to watch her rifle through the pills--

COHLE (CONT’D)
What’s it run?

LUCY
Um... I’m thinking. I seen the blue
go for three a pill.

COHLE
We'll say two-hundred for all of
them.

Lucy blinks back disbelief: the cop’s not going to rip her
off. Cohle hands her the money, which she takes wide-eyed,
cautiously--

Cohle examines the bottle of about sixty pills while Lucy
watches, relaxing a little for the first time--

LUCY
Thought you might just take them.
Or that you wanted something
else... Some kind of something
else.

She reclines on her bed, legs stretching under a denim skirt,
bruises on her knees. An invitation--

COHLE
No.

LUCY
...Then I thought, you’re a good-
lookin man. You wouldn’t need a
shakedown to get some.
26.

Lucy continues to watch Cohle as puts the cap back on the
pills, stuffs them in his blazer pocket. During their
interaction, Cohle remains civil but cold, unresponsive to
her gestures. The light from the window is dowdy and orange,
dramatizing his edge--

LUCY (CONT’D)
...What’s your deal?

SFX: SOUND of a BOTTLE BREAKING outside the window--

Cohle moves to the window, sees down below a PERSON run into
SHADOWS across the street, disappearing--

COHLE
I don’t have a deal.

LUCY
I mean, what you do. You’re not
like cops I know. Even the bad
ones.

COHLE
Who’re the bad ones?

LUCY
..-Nevermind... I thought you was
gonna bust me last week.

COHLE
Not interested.

LUCY
Yeah. I know. You’re kind of
strange... Like you might be
dangerous.

COHLE
Of course I’m dangerous. I’m
police. I can do terrible things to
people with impunity.

She goes quiet, and Cohle scans the stuffed toys on her bed,
their paws and glass eyes an uncomfortable decoration--

COHLE (CONT’D)
..+-You remember that girl I first
asked you about? The blonde?
She nods--

LUCY
I still ain’t heard nothing.
27.

COHLE
You know anybody might’ ve?
LUCY
No. I talked to everybody I know...
But...
COHLE
What?
LUCY

I just thought of this... If she
was gaming, and she was south side?
I heard about this place. A kind of
trailer park. Or campground like.
Some of the working girls stay
there. Supposed to, anyway. Kind of
a, what you call it, co-operative?
Call it The Ranch.

COHLE
...Where’s this?

LUCY
South of Fayetteville. Around
Devil’s Den. Supposed to be, way I

heard it.

COHLE
.+-Hill people. Meth cookers.
Bikers.

LUCY

Yeah. You know the place?..

Lucy watches Rust’s face as he thinks to himself, putting
something together--

COHLE
Take care, Lucy. I’1l holler.

He exits, shuts the door--

On her bed with the pills, almost unconsciously, Lucy curls
up with a stuffed bear and closes her eyes--

INT. COHLE’S TRUCK, MOVING - NIGHT

Cohle heads south in his TRUCK, moving down a rural highway
toward his apartment. DAWN just starting to break, red
spilling into the horizon’s edge, barely lighting an
ELECTRICAL STATION, an AIR TRAFFIC TOWER, BARBED WIRE fences--
28.

COHLE’S POV FX: a system of TRACER IMAGES flashes from the
things he passes, similar to a drugged effect. LINES of
ELECTRIC LIGHT flickering in the dark sky around him--

Cohle squints, shakes his head, fighting the hallucination--

COHLE’S POV FX: In his HEADLIGHTS, the faintest images of a
WOMAN'S FACE, like a poorly projected film, barely there-

COHLE (V.0.)
..-Yeah, my ‘vision problems’. I
told Marty about them down the
line. Like years down the line...

Driving, tracer images fleeting around him, Rust massages his
temple--

COHLE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Chemical flashbacks. Neural fallout
from my time in the HIDTA.

The tracers grow in intensity, the light swallowing him as he
drives, FADE TO WHITE--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Cohle, 51--

COHLE
As in High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Area. Three years
undercover... You know what that
means?

A beat as he receives an answer from his interviewer--

COHLE (CONT’D)
That stuff’s still sealed, huh?
-.-Nah. I’11 talk about it. I don’t
care...

A beat as Cohle watches his cigarette burn, sinks into
personal recollection--

COHLE (CONT’D)
...Blowout. Car swerved suddenly.
She'd just stepped into the road...

He gathers his words a moment, having begun off-track--

COHLE (CONT’D)
Anyways. Afterward, Claire and I
sort of turned on each other. All
the ways a man and woman can.
(MORE )
29.

COHLE (CONT’D)
Subtle betrayals. Cruelty... We
resented each other for being
alive, you know? ...I transferred
from robbery to Narco, started
going 24/7. Street rips, kicking
doors.

Cohle pauses, puts out his cigarette--
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

In a darkened ALLEY behind a convenience store, Rust Cohle,
27, braces TWO DEALERS against the wall, gun to their heads,
yanking baggies out their pockets and stuffing them in his
own--

COHLE (V.0.)
Within a year I was ripping-off
dealers and robbing couriers--

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A dim MOTEL ROOM. Rust sits shirtless at a table, doing a
line of coke with a burnt glass crack pipe, some bronze
scouring pads, and tequila nearby--

COHLE (V.0.)
.+-Holing up at a Ramada Inn with a
couple eight-balls and Don Julio.

He falls back in his chair, his eyes crazed and blinking, lit
by the window blinds--

COHLE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Somewhere in there Claire left.

INT. TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

POV- looking upward at Cohle in a dim room. 27, dressed as a
white trash tweaker, circles under his eyes, Cohle points a
S&W NINE MILLIMETER at the camera--

COHLE (V.0.)
Somewhere in there I emptied a nine
into a crankhead who'd been
injecting his infant daughter with
his own blood.

Cohle discharges all fourteen rounds directly at the camera,
his face impassive, muzzle flash like a strobe, more blood
with every flare. The only sound the voice-over--
30.

COHLE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Guy said he was trying to ‘purify’
her.

INT. ROOM, POLICE STATION, LOUISIANA - NIGHT

Cohle, 27, still dressed like a tweaker, looking rough, sits
in a room with FOUR suited POLICE OFFICIALS, listening as
they speak sternly to him. One of them slaps a hand on the
table, having insulted Cohle--

COHLE
. (to group) .
Bein’ UC... It’s like the persona I

maintain. Like, uh, Serpico...

MAN 1
Serpico never pissed himself after
passing out in court.

MAN 2
Serpico never executed an unarmed
man.

The men sit back and let Cohle fully digest his situation--

MAN 1
I think you better listen very
closely to what Special Agent Bokum
tells you--

One man, SA BOKUM, starts talking, laying out a course of
action, but Cohle’s voice-over provides the dialogue--

COHLE (V.0.)
State Attorney and IA Commander
gave me one shot. Keep your
profile, they said. Be our maniac
addict...

INT. BIKER GARAGE - NIGHT

A BIKER GANG, heavily armed, has assembled to conduct a deal
in a converted garage/headquarters. Merchandise in TWO
SUITCASES on a table, money and drugs--

NOTICE Rust Cohle, 27, facilitating the deal, dressed in
riding leather and bandanna, no shirtsleeves, his flame and
dice TATTOO visible down his forearm--
31.

COHLE (V.0.)
They made me a floater. I became
like some kind of trick got passed
around to any state department or
interagency task force that needed
a deep cover narc. Got Special
Agent Bokum beaucoup political
clout.

ON Cohle, paranoid, suppressing his fear as he watches the
BIKERS negotiate the deal...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Rustin Cohle sits behind the table, the beer gone but the
ashtray and cigarettes still there. Traumatized eyes--

COHLE
Three years of that and I couldn’t
get the walls in my apartment to
stop whispering. Or the carpet
fibers to quit their high-pitched
shrieking...

He reaches into a jacket pocket and produces a slim FLASK
(unmistakably smartass, as he made his interrogators furnish
him with beer) --

COHLE (CONT’D)
-..You really don’t know this?..

He unscrews the cap on the flask and sips it. Shrugs--

COHLE (CONT’D)
In January of ‘88 I killed three
cartel men at the Port of Houston.
Took one in the chest. Spent four
months at the Northshore
Psychiatric Hospital in Slidell.
They offered me a medical pension.
Jackpot, right? I said, No. I said,
Put me on homicide somewhere...
People owed me favors by then.
Special Agent Bokum was State
Attorney General Bokum, at that
point...

EXT. RAINBOW APARTMENTS - NIGHT

Just barely inching toward dawn, the night/morning blue,
objects tinged with snow and frost outside the ratty brick
APARTMENT BUILDING where Cohle, 31, lives. His TRUCK pulls
up, shuts off--

 
32.

COHLE (V.0.)
For a long time after that, I don’t
really sleep. Nightmares. PTSD.
Exhausted nerves. Whatever.

Cohle exits his car and approaches his front door. ICICLES
line the eaves above the door, glittering pink in the new-
rising sun--

COHLE’S POV FX: an ICICLE shimmers, fractures, and an ICE
ANGEL manifests, turning once into the brightness, then
fading back to squiggly light running down an ICICLE. Again,
almost a trick of the light--

COHLE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
So back then, at times I’d see
things. Neural fallout, like I
said.

Cohle opens his door, pauses. He stands directly under the
icicle, turns his face up to it, as if daring it to fall into
his eye--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Cohle, 51, sipping his flask and smoking a cigarette,
listening to a question--

COHLE
..-Why homicide? Something I saw at
Northshore. This quote from
Corinthians. ‘The body is not one
member but many. Now are they many,
but of one body.’

He lets the answer lie, hits his smoke. Let’s them ask a
follow-up question--

COHLE (CONT’D)
...I was just trying to stay part
of the body.

Off the complexity of this nihilist’s answer--
INT. ARKANSAS STATE CID, LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Cohle, 31, is in the locker room washing his hands when Hart
enters. Both men looked tired. Cohle dries his hands and
watches as Hart goes to his LOCKER and starts pulling out a
new shirt and tie--

Cohle walks over to him, talking while Hart re-dresses
himself, taking off yesterday’s shirt and tie and replacing
them--
33.

COHLE
Got something might be good. Some
Prost co-op to the south, ‘round
Devil’s Den.

HART
Thought we were looking at the
husband's old running buddies
today?

COHLE
Try this first.

Hart continues getting dressed, shrugs in acquiescence. He
notices Rustin still standing by him, watching him--

HART
...What?

COHLE
Nothing, man...
(sniffs)
Wash up, you got some pussy on you.

Cohle turns away, moves to grab his jacket from his own
LOCKER--

HART
...Spontaneity. Key to a healthy
marriage.

Cohle doesn’t turn to him, gathering up his own gun and
jacket from his locker--

COHLE
..-Yeah? That’s Maggie, huh?

Hart's eyes widen in fury before Cohle can even realize the
implication of what he said--

HART
Hey, what’s with you and your
fucking nose?
Hart marches toward him--

COHLE
What..? Nothing. Forget it.

Hart braces him, slams him into the lockers--
HART
I get a connotation of something
being implied here. About my wife?
About ‘Maggie’?

COHLE
You saying that’s wife, that high-
tide you're walking in with?

HART
You got some opinion ‘bout how my
wife’s pussy’s supposed to smell?!

They struggle, but Hart pins him against the locker--

COHLE
...I meant you wearing the same
clothes as yesterday, too. Coupled
with. I didn’t mean to imply
anything about any...
particularity, to the scent...

HART
You don’t say fuck-all about my
wife. Don’t say her name.

34.

The men stare at each other with inches between them, Hart’s

fists bunched at Cohle’s collar, raising him up--

COHLE
(re Hart’s hands)
You got some self-loathing this
morning, fine. Not worth losing
your hands over.

Hart chuckles at the threat, Cohle considerably outsized by

the older man--

HART
How'd that work, exactly?

COHLE
I break both your wrists. You're a
cop... You think I’m lying?

Hart studies his face, something cold in Cohle repulsing him.
He lets go and storms toward the exit, snatching his jacket

on the way--

Cohle watches him depart, let’s out a long sigh and leans
against the locker, calmly takes the pulse in his neck, as if

idly curious about his heart rate--
35.

INT. CID CAR, MOVING - DAY

Hart and Cohle drive south on 71 through the foothills of the
Boston Mountains, deep hollers and hilly woods, layers of
shaded obfuscation and cave systems--

Silence, tension--

Cohle thinks to himself, staring outside the window. Hart
glances at him now and then, still fuming (his anger based in
self-loathing, as Cohle guessed)--

Ahead a GREEN HIGHWAY SIGN reads ‘DEVIL’S DEN STATE PARK 21
mi.’--

HART
You got a specific location for
this place? Or we just going to
wander around till we find it?

Cohle keeps staring outside the window--

COHLE

Gonna have to get directions.
HART

...-Maybe you can just follow the

smell.

A few beats pass, then Cohle starts laughing. Hart grins,
chuckles with him--

EXT. HIGHWAY 71 - DAY

Both men laugh as the CID car exits the highway into steep
hill country, descending into a labyrinth of cold shadows and
icy, skeletal trees--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Martin Hart, 56, speaks--

HART
No. Except for what happened in
2002, we never fought. He was a
pretty even-keel guy, Rust.
Strange, but we got along.

EXT. DEFUNCT AUTO GARAGE - DAY

The CID car pulls into a small, junkyard-style SERVICE
STATION, blocks of exposed concrete foundation where its fuel
pumps used to be. The detectives exit the car, begin walking
toward the open-air garage portion through high weeds--
36.

INT. DEFUNCT AUTO GARAGE - DAY

Inside, TWO MEN on stools are fiddling with something on a
work table as Cohle and Hart approach. We only hear Hart’s
voice-over for dialogue----

HART (V.O.)
..-And he had some moves. Turned
out he had a few CIs down this way
from his time undercover. Told him
some names to maybe talk to.

Both MEN are skinny tweakers with wiry, greasy hair, bundled
in raggedy jackets against the cold. They appear to be
working--

COP’S POV-- as the detectives get close, see that the two men
have dismantled an old hi-fi SOUND SYSTEM, scattering the
electronic guts over the work table--

Cohle asks these men something--
HART (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Tell you this, too. He had as good
a bullshit detector as anybody...

The two men both shake their heads in adamant ignorance at
Cohle’s question--

EXT. DEFUNCT AUTO GARAGE - DAY
Cohle and Hart walk out of the garage, back to the car,
dejected, having learned nothing. Hart climbs in, but Cohle
pauses at his door--
HART (V.O.)
...-And Rust had the keenest eye for

human weakness I’ve ever seen.

Cohle doesn’t get in the car, thinks, tells Hart to ‘hold on’
and starts walking back to the garage--

INT. DEFUNCT AUTO GARAGE - DAY

The two tweakers look up from their work table to see Cohle
storming toward them--

COHLE
Sorry. I realized we got off on the
wrong foot--

Cohle kicks over their stools--
37.

COHLE (CONT’D)
--So I wanted to come back and put
the right foot up your ass.

With a wild roundhouse swing he smashes a half-dismantled
TURNTABLE over the head of one tweaker, grabs the other by
his jugular, slams his face on the table--

INT. CID CAR - DAY

Car running, heater on, Hart waits with a measure of boredom.
Casually, he sniffs his fingers... Then COHLE appears from
the garage, walks back. Cohle opens the door and gets inside--

COHLE
We want to go south on 220. There’s
a loop off the shoulder before it
hits 74... Gotta go down a dirt
fishing road toward Lee Creek.

Hart is both surprised and slightly unnerved--

HART
...’Kay.

Hart puts it in reverse, backs out as the tweakers stagger to
the garage entrance, one massaging his throat, the other his
head--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Martin Hart, 56, continues talking--

HART
..-Yeah. I mean, I didn’t know
then, but he told me later. All
that undercover stuff... Looking
back, I just think he hadn’t quite
transitioned yet, you know? Like
soldiers rotating back into the
world. He had some issues he had to
work through. But he did. He got
over it... He was a straight arrow
for a long time.

A beat, as he listens to a question. Answers--
HART (CONT’D)
No. You want to know about that
stuff, you need to ask Rust.

Off the dim sense that Hart is in some way covering for his
ex-partner--
38.

EXT. DEVIL’S DEN - DAY

ESTABLISHING- a forest of limestone cliffs and mostly bare
trees, some verdant foliage, bucolic, steep declivities of
rock and clay, creek SOUNDS in the near distance--

ON a DIRT ROAD cutting through the brush as the CID CAR
enters the forest, bumping along the uneven path, taking
tight turns--

EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

ESTABLISHING- a series of TRAILER HOMES- old, decrepit but
restored -sit arranged in semi-circle, like a wagon train, an
improvised, interdependent shelter nestled in an overhang of
trees and forest. LAUNDRY hangs between trailers, all female
items, an abundance of antennas on the roofs of the trailers--

The yard around is unusually clean, and only two CARS are
nearby, both beaters--

A WOMAN (JAN) exits one trailer and crosses the yard to
another, freezing to look up the rise as the CID CAR starts
trundling toward her--

INT. TRAILER HOME, THE RANCH - DAY

Inside one trailer, somewhat messy with a scattering of
magazines and dirty plates. TWO WOMEN lounge on a couch,
watching a soap on TV. They look up as ANOTHER WOMAN (JAN,
40s) leads Cohle and Hart inside--

FOLLOW them down a thin hallway with three small bedrooms,
each with a MATTRESS on the floor--

As though conducting a brief tour, Jan leads them back toward
the kitchenette--

JAN
I’m usually here, ‘cause the lease
is in my name. Lots of girls come
through, though...

COHLE
And this is what, like some
hillbilly bunny ranch?

JAN
Excuse me? You might want to talk
to Sheriff Bilson ‘fore you start
tossing accusations around.
39.

HART
Relax. It doesn’t matter. We’re not
vice.

COHLE

Something happened to a girl. We
need to know if any of you knew
her.

Cohle has taken Dora’s mugshot from his jacket, hands it to
Jan--

JAN
-.-Yeah... That’s Dori. Huh.
Something happened?

BETH (0.S.)
Something happened to Dori?

Everyone turns to look at the trailer doorway, where a very
young girl (BETH) now stands, looking concerned--

INT. JAN'S TRAILER HOME, THE RANCH - DAY

Inside another of the trailers, this one neater and cleaner,
cheaply furnished but well-maintained. Home decor includes a
good amount of Precious Moments porcelain figures, other
signs of childish romanticism. Beth sits upset, with Cohle
and Hart on chairs across from her. Jan stands at the
kitchenette counter, smoking a cigarette and listening--

Beth is petite, brunette, very pretty, and looks MAYBE
fourteen--

HART
How old are you?

Beth’s eyes dart to Jan and back--

BETH
Eighteen.
HART
You got I.D.?
BETH
Somebody stole my wallet. Last

week.

Hart looks sternly toward Jan, who smokes with a nonchalant
defiance. A hard-weathered woman who’s made her peace--
40.

COHLE
(back on track)
You knew Dora? Dori?

BETH
Yeah. I mean, a lot of us did. She
was here... a good bit?

JAN

For about three months, more or
less. Not every night.

BETH
Yeah. Stopped seeing her a few
weeks ago. She left a bag.

HART
You pretty good friends with her,
Beth?

She shrugs, sad, teary--

BETH
She was nice to me, when I first
came around. Gave me tips and
stuff.

HART
Tips about what?

Beth glances at Jan again--

BETH
..-Nothing. You know, just how to
be.

We might now NOTICE that something about Hart’s gaze is
unusually intense when applied to this girl, Beth, a concern
that also includes a kind of fascination. His eyes linger too
long on her, thought not in a covetous way--

HART
You got any idea where she might
have been staying, these past few
weeks?

Beth thinks, wipes her eyes, glances at Jan--

BETH
I don’t... Her ex’s in prison. I
supposed she maybe just got a new
place and that’s why we didn’t see
her no more.

(MORE )
41.

BETH (CONT'D)
She'd been going to church. I's
hoping maybe she just got it

together.

HART
Anybody else around here would
know?

BETH

I don’t know... She talked to me
more than anybody, I think.

HART
(to Jan)
We're going to need to question any
of the girls might’ve known her.

JAN
That’s a tougher ask than you
think. Folks be staying away, they
hear y’all are at the ranch.

COHLE
It’s the best way to get us to
leave quick.

Jan shrugs, puts out her smoke. Hart is still looking at
Beth, who demurely shrinks under his gaze--

COHLE (CONT’D)
You said she left a bag?

Beth nods, wipes her nose and glances at Jan--
Jan nods--

TIME CUT:

INT. JAN’S TRAILER - DAY

Beth is gone. The detectives face Jan, who still stands at
the counter, now smoking a new cigarette--

HART
That girl ain’t eighteen. Sheriff
know you got teenagers working
here?

JAN
What do you know about where that
girl’s been? Where she’s come from?

Jan displays a cool stridency--
JAN (CONT'D)

What kind of provisions you think
the world makes for a woman in
these parts? My husband proved out
to be a lying piece of dogshit, and
the only thing I ever got off him
was his daddy owned a little
hunting lease. This. You want to
know Beth’s situation ‘fore she ran
out on her uncle?

COHLE
Take it easy.

HART
There’s other places for her to go.

JAN
Such dick-swinging bullshit from
you. It’s a woman’s body, isn’t it?
A woman's choice?

HART
Sometimes. Don’t make it right.
Don’t make it healthy. There's
diseases.

JAN
Don’t people walk around this earth
all the time having sex for free?
And unprotected? You want to stop
disease you should stop people
having casual sex... Why is it you
add business to the mix, boys like
you can’t stand the thought?
...It’s ‘cause suddenly you don’t
own it like you thought you did.

 

42.

Some part of this strikes Hart, but before he can respond,
Beth enters with a small CANVAS BAG. She clocks the tension
in the room, glances at Jan for approval, and hands the bag
to Hart. He watches her sit as Cohle immediately begins to

dig through the bag--

Hart watches him, observes the bag’s contents: bundled

CLOTHES, some MAKE-UP, a ratty NOVEL (Peyton Place), a small

NOTEBOOK and a number of folded, yellow FLYERS--
Cohle starts reading the notebook--

HART
(to Jan)
How about her customers? Anybody
saw her regular, you can point out?
JAN

43.

Now that... that I would not know.

She and Hart lock eyes. She’s unbudging--

Cohle stands--

COHLE

Ma’‘am. You’ve both been very
helpful. Thanks much. You got
friends at State CID.

He shakes Jan’s hand, then

Beth’s, slipping her two twenties--

Hart seems briefly torn, like he’s not ready to leave, but
then stands, his glance repeatedly returning to Beth. She by
now is becoming more comfortable with his attention, smiles

shyly--

Then the detectives exit--
EXT. THE RANCH - DAY
WOMEN have stepped outside
the path toward their car.
flipping through the small
almost distraught--

COHLE

to watch the policemen trudge up
Cohle carries Dora’s old bag,
notebook. Hart seems perturbed,

(reading notebook)
‘Closed my eyes and saw St. Michael
and his sword on fire over my

head...’ Marty..
journal...

HART

this is like her

Believe this shit? A girl that
young? And you know the sheriff's
got a stake in the place. Fucking

Christ.

COHLE
(reading)

‘,..and his voice was silent but
what he said was spelled in flames
that came from his mouth...’

Both men climb in the car,

slam the doors--

WOMEN’S POV-- they all watch as the black CID car backs up

and turns around--
44,

INT. CID CAR, MOVING - DAY

Hart drives as he and Cohle reach the main road, Cohle just
finishing flipping through her notebook--

HART
(re notebook)
She sounds like a nutjob. Too much
of whatever she was on, for too
long.

COHLE
It’s... interesting...

A few beats pass as Hart drives and Cohle pulls the YELLOW
FLYERS from Dora’s bag--

HART
...-Figure we should maybe stay out
here today. Check around the bars
and truck-stops for johns, maybe
knew her.

COHLE
Yeah. Okay. Lookit this--

Cohle hands him one of the flyers--

ON the FLYER-- it’s a cheap photocopy on yellow paper, a
strange amalgam of COLLAGE cut from magazines and magic-
marker TEXT. Images include a STONE CHRIST, a GLOBE, FLAMES
and drawn, black TENTACLES reaching up into the flames. TWO
EYES watching over it all--

PAN down handwritten TEXT that reads ‘ARE YOU LOST? DO YOU
FEEL THE FLAMES AT YOUR HEELS? JESUS CHRIST CAN SAVE YOU! YOU
ARE OUR FAMILY - VISIT YOUR HOME - SPEAK WITH CHRIST -
WORSHIP IN FELLOWSHIP - BE RESTORED - IT’S NOT TOO LATE!!!’
FRIENDS OF CHRIST THE REDEEMER - 13590 CR 4588 - Northwest
Arkansas--

HART
Huh. Lot of those type places,
expect the flock to canvas for
them.

COHLE
Make some time for it, we’re done
cruising johns.

Hart nods, gives the flyer back, and the car accelerates onto
the highway--
45.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Rustin Cohle, 51, listening to his interviewer and smoking.
His flask stands on the table beside the ashtray--

COHLE
Nah. Nothing from any johns that
time... Late by the time we headed
back to Fort Smith...

Rust listens a beat as he receives a questions, smokes--

COHLE (CONT’D)
Think it was eating at Marty a
little. That girl at the ranch. Him
with two daughters.

In Cohle’s expression is the barest hint that he is studying
his interviewers--

INT. HART HOME, KITCHEN TABLE - NIGHT

Early evening. Dinner simmering on the stove. ON MARGARET
HART, 35, sitting at the kitchen table, drink in hand, her
face staring into the glass, cold, unhappy--

Martin stands over her--

MAGGIE
Just don’t see the point... I mean,
why bother?

Hart sits down beside her quickly--

HART
Honey, I’m sorry. It’s just the
case. I slept it off in the car.
You know how I do. We been through

this.

MAGGIE
It’s like you don’t want to be here
anymore.

HART

What? Years we been through this.
Sweetheart, listen to me. There is
nowhere else I want to be.

 

Maggie looks at him. She is pretty, but not as young or
obviously sexy as Lisa Tragnetti. We might notice, though,
that Lisa is essentially a younger, fitter version of the
same physical type as Maggie--
46.

MAGGIE
I don’t think that’s true.

Defensive, hair-trigger, Hart stirs up some self-
righteousness--

HART
Oh come _on. Bad enough the shit I
have to wade through on a daily
basis. Now you bring me this feel-
bad-for-me crap when I been working
forty hours straight. I come home
to the place, the one place where I
know there’s peace and love, and
this, this--

She doesn’t respond, and he re-mounts--

HART (CONT’D)
What do you want me to say? You
want me to talk about a woman got
killed, had wings melted to her
back? You want me to talk about

kids getting raped and beheaded?
Then you’re going to stop the “poor-
me” shit?

MAGGIE
..-That’s what I’m doing, huh?
Trying to make you feel bad for me?

He calms, touches her hand--

HART
You’re my world, babe... But yeah,
you know, sometimes I think you
might have a penchant for self-
pity... And I need you strong. So
that I can do my job.

She watches him, her eyes subtly picking him apart. Without
acknowledging any belief in him, she wipes her eyes and
stands, moves to the stove--

MAGGIE
.»-Can you tell the girls dinner?

Marty rises, watches her back at the stove for a few beats,
feeling that there is some opportunity for him here, a
partial healing, if he can just cross the kitchen to her--
But he turns around and walks down the hall--

Dry-eyed, Maggie continues stirring a pot of mashed potatoes--
47.

INT. HART HOME, HALLWAY/GIRLS’ ROOM - NIGHT

Martin Hart walks down the hallway of his home, FAMILY
PICTURES on the wall, including his WEDDING PICTURE, the
GIRLS at various ages--

As he nears the girls’ room he can hear their voices, and it
sounds like one of them says “killed her” --

Hart moves into the doorway. His TWO GIRLS (Audrey, Macie)
both kneel on the floor around a group of DOLLS and
immediately look up at him, beaming--

AUDREY MACIE
Daddy! Daddy!

They leap up to swamp him with hugs. There is a slight
desperation to their clamoring for his love, and though Hart
could never define the reaction or its catalyst, it makes him
vaguely uncomfortable--

He doesn’t notice, but he gently prods them off of him--

HART
Go into the kitchen, okay? Dinner’s
ready.

MACIE

Are you coming?

HART
You bet. I’m starved.

AUDREY
Okay!

They girls move out the room, though they wish to linger--

Hart stands alone in their doorway, looks into their room:
its pink colors and toys, a little girl’s room, these images
contrasting in his mind to the lives he’s seen the past few
days. His eye catches the DOLLS his daughters were playing
with on the floor, and he approaches the toys--

HART’S POV-- we see that the girls have a NAKED BARBIE lying
on the carpet. Arranged around her, standing and wearing
clothes, are THREE KEN DOLLS and a G.I. JOE--

It looks unmistakably like four men looking down at_a dead,
violated body--

ON Hart’s eyes, wide with the inarticulate dread every father
with a daughter must feel at some point--
48.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Rustin Cohle, 51, faces us, smokes and drinks--

COHLE
.--I think of my daughter now, what
she’d been spared. I feel
grateful...

Cohle leans forward, as though the point he is making is his
most serious--

COHLE (CONT’D)
Docs told us she didn’t feel a
thing. Went straight into a coma.
Then, in that blackness, she
just... slipped into another,
deeper blackness... Isn’t that a
nice way to die. Painlessly, as a
happy child? ...Problem with dying
later is that by the time you grow
up, it’s too late. All the damage
has already been done.

Cohle sits back, hits his cigarette--

COHLE (CONT’D)
-+.I think now of the hubris it
took to yank a soul out the bliss
of non-existence into this- this
meat. No matter what else, the
world hurts. 24/7. To force someone
else into that hurt...

 

He drinks, shakes his head as if the idea is unconscionable--

COHLE (CONT’D)
...So my daughter, she spared me
from the sin of being a father.

On Cohle’s eyes, the layers within his gaze--
EXT. COUNTY ROAD, NORTHWEST ARKANSAS - DAY

ESTABLISHING-- a RURAL ROAD cutting through barren, rolling
hills, dead yellow grass, desolate fields of scrubweed.
Occasional stretches are demarcated with barbed-wire fencing,
all under a metallic white sky, hazy mountains fringing the
distance--

 

COHLE (V.0.)
That’s how I learned to see it.
49.

Cohe and Hart’s black CID CAR passes down the county highway,
dwarfed by the expanse of snowy countryside--

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Martin Hart, 56, slightly irritated, adjusts himself in his
seat--

HART
Listen. Can we cut through this a
minute? I know what’s going on. I
got friends. I read... You caught
another, didn’t you? What was it,
in Bastrop..? Wings.

He sits back, pleased with his intelligence, waits a few
beats as an answer is given to him--

HART (CONT’D)
Right... And I understand our old
files being lost in the flood, but
you're taking the long way
around... You keep asking about
Rust.

He becomes more serious, studies his interviewers--

HART (CONT’D)
You're trying to jam somebody up.

Sit a beat on Hart’s stern eyes, then--
INT. CID CAR, MOVING - DAY

Inside the detectives CAR as it continues through the same
expanse of hinterland, cruising the desolation. JUNK in the
fields, isolated SHACKS--

Hart drives while Cohle consults a MAP spread over his lap,
the yellow FLYER for ‘FRIENDS OF CHRIST’ on top of it--

They pass empty plains, a ruined HOMESTEAD or collapsed BARN
here and there--

HART
Doesn’t make sense... There’s
nothing out here.

COHLE
Looking at the map, it’s got to be
around these few miles.
50.

They drive a few beats, pass a burned out BUILDING with high
gables but no roof, outer walls only standing in a field of
overgrown sawgrass and scrub--

HART
Maybe it was like one of those tent
revival places? Those things move

around.
COHLE
...There’s no date on the flyer.
(thinks )
Wait. Go back. Make a U--
HART
What? Why?

Hart slows and starts turning--
EXT. BURNED CHURCH - DAY

ESTABLISHING- the burnt-down BUILDING they already passed,
looks like it might have been a small CHURCH, with its tall
gables like steeples. Its front windows are broken out, SOOT
STAINS running halfway up the walls, no door, no roof, KUDZU
engulfing much of the structure--

The CID CAR pulls up. A field of BLACKBIRDS erupts beside the
church to their right--

ON the BLACKBIRDS--
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Cohle sits at the table, fiddling with his flask, responding--

COHLE
Wasn’t like that. I mean, I could
always tell what was real and what
wasn’t. I knew it wasn’t real...So
I'd just roll with it...

He pauses, lights a cigarette as his interviewer asks another
question--

COHLE (CONT’D)
...No. They tapered off. Stopped
all together after I was clean a
couple years.
51.

I/EXT. CID CAR / BURNED CHURCH - DAY

COHLE’S POV FX: out the window, he sees the FLOCK OF
BLACKBIRDS lift into the sky in a tight cluster, and ina
pointillistic abstraction, they seem to suddenly form a
WOMAN’S PORTRAIT--

--Then immediately the birds scatter into a looser grouping,
the picture gone. The flock keeps swaying over the field like
a phantom thumbprint--

HART
(re building)
No numbers on the place. Looks like
the fire was a long time ago...

Cohle looks away from the window, to Hart, then the building.
The men open their doors--

EXT. / INT. BURNED CHURCH - DAY

SLOWLY PAN into the demolished CHURCH, following Cohle and
Hart’s POV as they walk through the TALL GRASS and through
the open church entrance--

The church floor is covered in RUBBLE-- broken PEWS,
shattered GLASS crunching underfoot, the walls vandalized,
ALTAR crushed, strewn with debris, feces--

ONE WINDOW is still intact, a high one above the back wall.
It’s round, STAINED GLASS depicting the Madonna’s Ascension.
The LIGHT from the window is kaleidoscopic with stained
color. It falls on Cohle and Hart as their feet crunch over
the detritus--

HART
Okay. What? Place been trashed.
This is old damage. And no kind of
lead, son.

Cohle stands still and looks over the walls, their graffiti,
his eyes sharp and intense--

COHLE (V.0.)
Back then, the visions... Sometimes
I was convinced I’d lost it...

Cohle’s eyes fall on a particular section of the wall. He
starts approaching it--

COHLE (CONT’D)
Marty...
52.

Hart crosses the trashed space to Cohle, who’s studying the
wall. Hart likewise turns his attention to the wall--

 

POV-- on the WALL is a large, crude PAINTING which shows the
SILHOUETTE of an unclothed FEMALE ANGEL, kneeling as if in
prayer, a BEAM of painted light shining down on her figure.
Though her hands are in prayer, her HEAD is laid down, as if
resting--

It is unmistakably the exact pose in which Dora Lange’s body
was left to be found in the woods--

COHLE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
..-And other times I thought I was
seeing straight into the true heart
of things.

Cohle and Hart look at one another, confused as to what this
image might mean. Then back to the wall--

BEGIN RISING OVER the detectives, through the open roof,
framing the painting on the wall. Off the two men staring at
this spectral representation of Dora Lange’s body--

FADE TO BLACK.

END CHAPTER TWO.
