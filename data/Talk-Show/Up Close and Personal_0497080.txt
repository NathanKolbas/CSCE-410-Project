solves in which children grow up, women age, and men vanish and
get replaced, and in the b.g., always the trailer park.

LUANNE V.O.

-.-she was six years younger than me, so
she doesn’t remember our father. I mean
even before he split he was working down
in Vegas and we were stuck up at State-
line. Sallyanne didn’t get along with Lee
..-Lee was our mom’s third husband, he was
a pit boss at Harrah’s...so that’s how
Sallyanne came to move in with Wade and
me. I wouldn’t call that a big success,
but don’t put that in the interview...

mean, you're fired...

A CLICK as Trish hangs up. To Vic:

WARREN JUSTICE
I warned her, she could do the job or do
the nose candy, her choice. She made it.
Okay. Who you got for Barker Dan?

VIC NASH
Nobody. You could unfire Trish. She
always wanted to go on-camera.
WARREN ignores this and pours himself the last of the coffee.

WARREN JUSTICE
Melba...there’s no coffee again...

MELBA
Trish makes the coffee...

attention to a pub) ie servant violating
the voters’ trust..

No, Harvey. We play it straight. ‘The
superintendant of the consolidated school
aistrict was found guilty of banging a 14-

day in his defense School Superintendant
Lee Anders denied having carnal knowledge

TALLY ATWATER

MARCIA MILLER
The governor so appreciates a pretty face,

Tally, where are you sitting? You must
stop by our table...

No. I only drink decaf. Well.

We've got these marketing guys upstairs.
They run...focus groups. You know, ask
twenty citizens in for cold cuts and see
what they like and...don’t like.

TALLY sits absolutely still, her fear of failure confirmed.

Look. You’re coming across...as if you
haven‘’t decided you like being here...

TALLY ATWATER
That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.
I just think I need more support.

BUCKY TERRANOVA
That’s why you called 911 and said get ne
Bucky. Let’s cut to where you are. You
just had the stakes upped. You got the
network watching, Marcia makes you feel
like a babyfat wannabe from the wrong side
of town, and you’re scared shitless.

TALLY (too vehement)
I am not scared.
(a beat)
I was just wondering...if maybe I should
go back to Houston...say for a year...

BUCKY TERRANOVA
That could definitely be arranged.

TALLY lights up, then gets the body blow:

BUCKY TERRANOVA
And the year after that you go to Tupelo,
Mississippi. And the year after that you
blow your brains out.
(off the look on Tally’s face)
I told you in Houston. Not everybody ends
up sitting down when the music stops.

INT. JOANWA KENNELLY’S OFFICE -- TALLY ATWATER

daring to look at Joanna Kennelly directly.

TALLY ATWATER

Did he ever tell you what happened when he
was covering the White House?

TALLY turns, too distraught to see the point of this.

TALLY ATWATER
I shouldn’t keep you. You tape today.

JOANNA (ignoring her)
He kept asking questions they didn’t want
asked. One morning the briefer was giving
some bullshit line and Warren called him a
liar. Quote unquote. And the briefer
said, Justice, you are out of business.

(a beat)
Meaning nobody takes your calls.
(a beat)

After that he covered it from outside.
Broke stories nobody else had. The White
House got to the network and made it
clear, no more access for anybody...

TALLY ATWATER
They couldn’t carry through on that.

JOANNA KENNELLY
- Sure they could. There’s a flight to a
summit and I don’t sit next to the chief
of staff. There’s a one-on-one in the
Oval Office and Tom Orr doesn’t get it.
(a beat)

The network left it to Buford Sells to
tell him. Play it their way or the high-
way. Warren chose the highway.

TALLY stares at the skyline, unable to look at Joanna.

JOAMNA KENNELLY
Buford Sells was his best friend. He even
came on our honeymoon. To Lebanon, for
the Israeli invasion. After Buford laid
down the terms, they stopped speaking.

BUCKY TERRANOVA

They’re right.

TALLY ATWATER

BUCKY TERRANOVA

on Reform Act. Cut to McBride, smash into

his campaign bites, “this is a prison, not

@ resort" blah blah blah...over each bite
we show the effect on his ratings...

ANOTHER ANGLE -- TALLY

watches JOHN MERINO to get his reaction.

JOHN MERINO looks at Tally, then at Warren.

TALLY ATWATER
His approval jumps five points every time
he mentions three-strikes-you’re-out...

MERINO (doubtful)
What/s the centrepiece.

WARREN JUSTICE
The night we air, his reelection campaign
is staging a victims’ vigil outside the
capitol. He's going to call for ten new
super-max prisons. Tally does it. Live.

JOHN MERINO
You’re coming down heavy on McBride...

WARREN JUSTICE

These prisons, John, are maxinum security
warehouses. You don’t need so many guards
inside, because nobody leaves his cell.
You don’t even need so many guards out-
side, because you'll have what they call
®death fences". Touch the fence and you
die. That’s what McBride calls reform.
Reform is a code word. For lock ‘em up
and throw away the key.

INT. WIL CORRIDOR -- DAY -- TALLY

sensing his hesitation, catches up with JOHN MERINO.

TALLY ATWATER
It’s a strong piece, isn’t it.

Strong. Right.

(a beat)
I just don’t want Warren to put you too
far ahead of the curve on this one.

TALLY ATWATER
Ahead of what curve?

MERINO

He shrugs.
- 102 -

Do I think the crime issue is manipulated
for political ends? Absolutely. Do I
think there’s a contradiction between what
McBride says and what he means? Absolute-
ly. Do I think large numbers of citizens
want to hear that? Not necessarily.

TALLY
T thought it was our job to tell people
things they didn’t want to hear.

MERINO (carefully)
I don't think you want Warren too far out
on a limb here. Not if you want him to
get another one of these on the air.

INT. . TALLY’S & WARREN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT -- TV SCREEN

EXT. STATE CAPITOL -- NIGHT -~ SCALE MODEL OF PRISOW

‘ANOTHER ANGLE -- WARREN JUSTICE WATCHING

TALLY ATWATER
Plans specify a private room for each men-

WARREN (to Ned)

it.

(to Tally)
Is “private room" how the governor’s of-
fice puts it?

{no response) >
Is “private room" @ pretty way of saying
isolation cell? The intention being no
interraction among inmates?

ANGLE ON DEMONSTRATORS
gathered for the the governor’s photo op vigil. .

TALLY ATWATER
I suppose so.

WARREN JUSTICE
‘nen say so. Did you rewrite this?

TALLY ATWATER
I did...a little editing.

WARREN JUSTICE
You edited out the point. McBride’s
peddling an ugly and very volatile package
to get himself reelected. Meanwhile let-
ting the voters feel good about themselves
by calling it “refora". Say so.

ANGLE ON JOHN MERINO WATCHING

TALLY ATWATER
I just wanted to balance...

WARREN (overrides her)
You're fudging. You’re trimming. You‘re

JOHN MERINO

WARREN JUSTICE

MERINO (loses it)
You think I didn’t know I’d get this kind
of shit from you? You think I wanted it?

TALLY (helpless)

JOHN MERINO
You think I even wanted this show? She
wanted it. You talk about your precious
honesty, she’s the one out there on the
line. And the only reason she’s out there
is to give you something to AO..-

TALLY AND WARREN look at each other, a long terrible beat as
John Merino, realising vhat he has said, breaks off. .

WARREN (to Tally)
You do what you want. I’m s: gning off.

WARREN tosses the script to John Merino, then turns and walks
back through the gathering crowd toward the street.

TALLY ATWATER
You walked out on me. The whole show
could have fallen apart. You let John get
between us and you left me up there alone.

WARREN JUSTICE
I was there because you dreamed up a job
for me. You dreamed it up and then you
bought it for me.
(looks at her)
you have any idea how that feels?

TALLY ATWATER
Anything I did was for us.

WARREN JUSTICE
"yg" has been the problem ever since I

came up here.

TALLY ATWATER
Us isn’t the problem. You are the prob-
jem. You wanted to stay in Houston and
protect yourself and not ever get your
hands dirty. You didn’t want to play.

WARREN JUSTICE
I told you that.

TALLY ATWATER .
You were afraid you wouldn’t win.

WARREN JUSTICE
You‘re not a fast study but you finally
got it.

TALLY ATWATER
I am #0 sick of trying to make this work
all by syseif.

WARREN (picks up bag)
You don’t have to try any more.

TALLY ATWATER

wes month ago, Governor George McBride,
who is campaigning for relection on the
pledge to “refora" Pennsylvania prisons,
cancelled this job-training program, sign-
ing an act confining inmates to their
cells. This act was the beginning of the
trouble here at Homesburg. I recently
asked Gov-ernor McBride how he could de-
scribe the permanent warehousing of pris-
oners as a reform. Repeated offenders,
he said, forfeit the right to rehabilita-
tion. "A prison is about punishment," he
added, “it’s not about another chance."
Fernando and his children know that now.
This is Tally Atwater...
