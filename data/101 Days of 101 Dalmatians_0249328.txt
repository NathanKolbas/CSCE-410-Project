aging beauty. White skin, heavy eye make-up, carefully drawn red
lips, stark, raw cheek bones. Her hair is white-blonde on one
side and jet black on the other. Her slender frame is wrapped in
white fur. A cigarette burns in her jeweled right hand. She lets
out a puff of smoke and addresses Anita in an earthy voice.

CRUELLA
Good morning, darling.

CU. ANITA

She quickly recovers from her surprise and greets Cruella with
genuine warmth. She likes her and is pleased to see her.

Cruella, relieved that Cruella likes her design.

 

CRUELLA
Fur?
#2

Anita's surprised by the question.

ANITA
No, no. Linen.

CRUELLA
It would be stunning in fur.

ANITA
It's funny you should say that. I
got the idea for the pattern from my
dog. She's a Dalmatian.

CRUELLA
How charming.
(looking at the drawing)
Linen? You're quite sure?

ANITA
You're wearing it to the Chesterton
Trials. That's in April. Fur would
be inappropriate.

CRUELLA
I suppose so.

She leans back in her chair.

CRUELLA
Isn't this marvelous? I'm taking
your advice. You were a hopeless
child lost in the most desperate
surroundings, pleading for escape. I
recognized your talent, swept you
from the gutter and introduced you
to a world of beauty, comfort and
achievement. A few short years, and
iim taking your council. I don't
know who's more blessed. Me or you.

ANITA
Me, of course, Cruella.

CRUELLA
But only by a whisker.

Cruella rises and crosses around the desk.

CRUELLA
You've done wonderful work for me.

Anita nods cautiously. Cruella steps around behind Anita. She
plants her bony hands on Anita's shoulders.
 

CRUELLA

You're not very well-known despite
your obvious talent.

ANITA
That doesn't matter to me.

  

releases Anita and crosses to the window. She looks out
@ square.

CRUELLA
Your work is fresh and clean,
unfettered, unpretentious. It sells.
And one of these days, my
competitors are going to figure out
who you are and they're going to try
and steal you away. I just want you

to know that you're very important
to me,

Anita is embarrassed by the praise.

CRUELLA
I'll top any offer you get. I want
you to stay with me. Forever.

ANITA
Cruella, it's never occurred to me
to leave my job. For another anyway.

CRUELLA
{turns to Anita)
What do you mean, “anyway?"

Cruella returns to her desk.

ANITA
I don't know. If I met someone.
CRUELLA
Marriage?
ANITA

Perhaps. Someday.

CRUELLA
More good women have been lost to
marriage than to all the wars,
famines, epidemics, and disasters
combined. You'd be an absolute fool
to throw you life away for a kiss on
the neck and a wedding ring.

Anita smiles politely. It's very much time to end the
conversation.

it was nice having this time with

A makeshift tannery. The musky room is crammed with pelts and
trophies, stuffed, skinned, and mounted animals, birds, and
insects. The macabre tools of an unsavory trade. The bespectacled

of an elephant foot umbrella stand. His name is MR. SKINNER.

out a black leather case.

JASPER

The sight of all these deceased
Creatures puts a mighty shrivel in

Skinner crosses to Jasper and Horace. He thrusts the case
into Jasper's arms.

JASPER
Much obliged, sunshine.

Horace tips his hat. Skinner examines his hairline. Horace slowly
brings his cap down over his eyes. He's uneasy.

ign firm. The managing director, ALLAN, a trendy young man in
his mid-twenties, is sitting behind a desk. His feet are up, he's
sipping a soft drink.

 

ROGER
Normally, I'd finish the game
completely then bring it to you,
but...I need the money.

ALLAN
I'm not the one you have to
convince.
CU. NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY

He's small and pasty. The sort of kid you'd expect to be a

HERBERT
Potentially good graphics,

dog's good, the environments are
engaging.

Roger's excited. He looks to Allan for his reaction.
HERBERT
But I'm not interested in a game
that has a chubby little dog catcher
as the bad guy.

Roger stares at him nervously.

HERBERT
Even girls won't like this. Sorry,
mate.
He gets up from his chair.
HERBERT

I'm late for choir practice.
ROGER
What if it had a better villain?
Someone you'd really hate.
HERBERT
It's not hatred that's important.
It's a desire to annihilate. Have a
nice day.
He exits. Roger sighs in defeat. He looks to Allan.
ALLAN
He's got the best instincts in the
industry. Since he was six, he's
picked the top selling game every
year.

ROGER
And it tastes like fish.

ANITA
You fell in, didn't you? No one with
their wits about them swims in a
dirty pond in a nice jumper and
slacks. And you lost a shoe, Did you
know that?

ROGER

As a matter of fact, I did. I
noticed it running down the gravel
path. I crashed my bicycle in the
pond. The only part of my body that
wasn't injured was my head. But now,
thanks to you, I have the complete
set of bodily injuries.

It was nice being assaulted by you,

EXT. VICTORIA MONUMENT. ROGER

Roger makes an extra circle around the Victoria Monument,
secretly hoping to run into Anita again. Roger CLEARS FRAME,
Anita ENTERS. They're on opposite sides of the monument, unaware
of each other's position.

CU. PONGO

He looks up at Roger. We can presume he's Pleased. He BARKS at
Roger. Roger looks down at him.

ROGER

You have it entirely wrong, Pongo.
I'm simply trying to decide on a
route home. It has nothing...

He squints in the late afternoon sun.

HIS Pov

Anita's gone.

CU. ROGER

A hint of disappointment.

screen.

INT. ROGER'S LIVING ROOM

Roger and Anita are sitting in front of the fire. Roger has an
ice bag on his head, a mug of tea in his hands, a blanket around
his shoulders. Anita is wearing one of Roger's shirts. She has a

blanket around her shoulders, a tissue to her nose, a cup of tea
in her hand.

ANITA
(stuffy)
I've never been rescued before. It
was very exciting. And you were very
sweet to give me a kiss.

Roger stares at her.

ROGER
That wasn't a kiss. It was mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation.

ANITA
(embarrassed)
Oh.

ROGER
But it didn't work very well. You're
supposed to lie flat on your back
and remain still. I couldn't really
do it properly with your arms around

my neck.

ANITA
I'm very sorry.

ROGER
It's alright.

ANITA

{after a pause)
You give very good rescue.

ROGER

They're going to be broken-hearted
when you leave.
CU. PERDY AND PONGO
They look to Roger and Anita with concern.
INT. LIVING ROOM. ROGER AND ANITA
Anita looks at Roger.
ANITA

I don't think I can bear to live
with a broken-hearted Dalmatian.

ROGER
They're miserable when they're
lonely.

ANITA

(setting her teacup aside)
We better think of something.

ROGER
I agree. Would you like another cup
of marriage?

ANITA
Excuse me?

ROGER
Tea. Another cup of tea?

ANITA
You said marriage.

26
#2

ROGER
Marriage?

ANITA
That's what you said. You meant to
say tea, but it came out marriage.

ROGER
I'm sorry. Do you want another cup
of tea?

ROGER
You do?

ANITA
I will.

ROGER
You will?

If you ask me.
Roger nervously looks into his teacup.

a second floor. NANNY, a plump, 60-year-old housekeeper, is
dusting blinds.

NANNY
T so loved living with your family
when you were little and now to be
with you again as you start a family
of your own is a dream come true.

ANITA
I'm not sure Roger and I are quite
ready to start a family, Nanny.

That's a shame. Well, first the
puppies then the babies...

Nanny's last remark suddenly hits her.

ANITA
Puppies?

He's working on his game. Pongo's sitting in front of the Tv,

If I've done my job right, when this
new villain comes on, you're going
to run from the room in a panic.

Focused, attentive, ears up.

CU. TV SCREEN

The animated Dalmatian runs into a hollow log. The screen GOES
BLACK for a moment. The end of the log comes into view as the dog
moves to a new level. A toothy, slime-dripping Dog Catcher drops
INTO FRAME, brandishing a net.

It's the look every woman gets when
she knows she's going to be a
mother. Notice how tranquil she is?
Her eyes are soft and warm.

CU. ANITA

As she stares at her dog, she assumes the human equivalent of
Perdy's expression.

NANNY (0.S.)
And though you might not see it, you
can certainly feel that she's
smiling. It's the smile we wear when
we're guarding a precious secret.

NANNY (0.S.)
Now she's living for others as well

NANNY (0.S.)
And every now and again, for no
reason other than she's so happy
with herself, she sighs.
Anita lets out a sigh.

Anita gives Perdy an affectionate hug and a kiss. Then she leans
back and turns to Nanny.

Roger)
You must be Rufus.

Roger offers his hand.

ROGER
It's Roger. It's a pleasure, Ms.
DeVille.

Cruella blows a puff of smoke in Roger's direction. She ignores
the handshake and returns to Anita.

CRUELLA
Don't tell me you married him for
his dog.
#2

She laughs. Anita sneaks an apologetic look to Roger. He bristles
as he unfastens the dogs from their leads and shoos them up the
stairs. Cruella swoops across to the sofa. She spreads her fur
coat and sits down. Anita sits in the arm chair. Roger stands
behind the chair.

 

 

CRUELLA
I've missed you, darling. I hate
that you've taken a leave.

I'm still working. You've been
getting my sketches?

No. He's very good at it. It's a
growing business.

CRUELLA
Those horrible noisy things that
children play with on their
televisions? Someone designs them?
What a senseless thing to do with
your life.

Roger simmers with anger.

ROGER
Did Anita tell you the news?

Anita tries to signal him to be silent. Cruella‘s suspicious. She
expects the worst.

You have been a busy boy.

She rises from the sofa and takes a pull on her cigarette.

I must say that is somewhat better
news. I adore puppies.

She collects her purse.

CRUELLA
I hate to run when I'm having fun

If I'm this nervous about your
