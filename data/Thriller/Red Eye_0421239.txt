FADE IN:

INT. A HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

SLOWLY TRACK ACROSS A FEW PHOTOGRAPHS ON AN OFFICE DESKTOP
(OR DRESSER) -- pictures of a young girl (who'll we'll soon
know as LISA REISERT) smiling wide, posing with her father
and two brothers... there’s a much smaller photo next to
this of Lisa with both her mother and father... we then come
across the final two photos...

Lisa, in cap and gown, at her HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION... Lisa
posing with her field hockey teammates and the trophy they’ve
just won... another photo in the same frame is an ATHLETIC
ACTION SHOT of Lisa facing down a foe on the field...

We hold on this image as Lisa's DAD enters, his back to us.

He drops his keys, his wallet, a stack of mail and the Miami
Herald on the desk, then heads 0.S.

But we keep HOLDING ON the stuff he’s: just placed on the
desk...

Dad closes the bathroom door... the shower starts --

Then suddenly -- a

LATEX-GLOVED HAND

WHIPS IN from out of frame and SWIPES Dad’s wallet away --
SMASH TO:

A SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS AND JUMP CUTS

SWISH PAN ACROSS A ROW OF WOODEN CRATES.

CU - INSPECTORS’ HANDS mark clipboards, STAMP the crates,
LIDS are FASTENED DO! -

ANOTHER SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS

- CROWBARS pry the lid off the WOODEN CRATE -- the lid is
tossed to the floor --

- GLOVED HANDS move in, quickly PEEL the sides of the crate
away to reveal FRESH FISH on ICE...

- BLUEPRINTS of a HIGH RISE BUILDING are unrolled across a
table...

- HANDS MOVE ACROSS SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of the LUX ATLANTIC
HOTEL, CLOSE-UPS of its upper floors, fingers pointing...

- BACK ON THE CRATE - Fish and ice are scraped away to reveal
another HEAVY PLASTIC CASE underneath... as the hands
earnestly clear the rest of the ice off this hidden case --
- CU - The PLASTIC CASE is shoved into the back of a VAN.
~ HEAVY LINE FISHING RODS are tossed in behind it.
- The van’s DOORS SLAM SHUT --

SMASH TO BLACK.
JUMP CUTS:

CU - HANDS RIP OPEN a FED-EX ENVELOPE -- the same WALLET we
saw next to Lisa’s photos slides out...

CU - The hands empty the CONTENTS OF THE WALLET -- credit
cards, Lisa's Dad's license, and VFW Membership card.

CLOSER ~ The cards and license are dropped back into the Fed-
Ex envelope.

TIGHT SHOT - The Fed-Ex envelope is tossed in the trash...

How could this happen, we made this

reservation six months ago --

Meet BOB and MARYANN TAYLOR, an unhappy couple, standing at
the front desk, glaring at our panicky assistant manager-in-
training, CYNTHIA, 22, frantically typing on her keyboard.

CYNTHIA
I know, ma'am, but I'm just not seeing
it --

MARYANN

Where's Lisa? She usually handles
our account, and we never have a

problem.
CYNTHIA
She's out of town, her grandmother

Cynthia, is it?
CYNTHIA
Yes, sir.
BOB

Would you get in more trouble if you
bothered her or if we complained to
corporate?

Cynthia's speechless, somewhere between exploding and bursting
into tears --

SMASH TO:
EXT. DALLAS, TEXAS - AIRPORT ROAD - NIGHT 1
Downpour. Thunder and lightning. Crawling TRAFFIC. An
impatient CHECKER CAB weaves in and out of lanes on a crowded
terminal road.

lays on the HORN, swings the wheel hard to the right, throwing

LISA REISERT

from one end of the back seat to the other. She's mid 20's.
Exhausted, frazzled, but not enough to detract from her simple
beauty as she digs for the ringing cell in her purse...

the anxious car)
Sorry. Man, crazy guy's gonna kill
somebody! Don't worry, you're still

smile, hands them to Bob and Maryann.

CYNTHIA
You're all set, and the first two
nights are on us. If you need
anything else, just let me know.

MARYANN

We won't.

Cynthia forces a smile as Bob and Maryann move off.

CYNTHIA

God, they totally threw me, they
were such assholes.

LISA
Cynthia, there are no guests who are
assholes, only guests with "special
needs.”
Cynthia smiles.

Lisa's cab rolls to a stop at the terminal. Lisa digs in
her purse, fishes out her wallet...

Um, the Simpsons say they didn't get
the California King they requested,
chiropractors need a bigger conference

mad.

Lisa slams the trunk, dashes for the terminal doors...

LISA
Okay, tell the Simpsons they do have
a California, 84 inches head to toe --
but still have the tape measure ready,
go ahead and swap the chiropractors
with the bingo suppliers and a fruit
basket and a bottle of Dom should
reset the mood for our lovebirds.

Cynthia jots notes, then finds a stray post-it note: -

CYNTHIA
Oh my god, security left a message
saying the Charles Keefe party is
arriving at 5:30 A.M. instead of
P.M.

 

Lisa reacts. Shit.

LISA
Yeah, they always change arrival
times, it's a security thing. Just
make sure our security has the front
entrance set for Keefe, his own guys
will take it from there.

reminiscing at the sight of dusty dolls, games, cheerleading
outfit, a field hockey uniform...

dead in her tracks as she looks ahead to see
A TICKETING AREA 11A

We come upon LISA in line, listening to the concerto on her
I-Pod, trying to drown out the world, but having little luck.

She shifts her eyes between the crawling check-in process
and the last few paperback pages of Dr. Phil's "Self Matters.”

The line moves a little more.
LISA'S FooT

pushes her bag forward, a little too far. The bag's wheels
knock a nice older LADY's foot in front of her.

LISA
Whoops.. I'm sorry...

NICE LADY
Oh, don't sweat it, I'm wearing my
combat boots.

LISA

Excuse me?

Yes you can, I just finished...
besides, my dad's given me enough of
these to start a library. Please.

The way Lisa says this, polite, warm, but firm, there's
nothing the nice lady can do but take it.

NICE LADY
(taking the book)
Well, thank you. That's very nice.

The redcoat nears Lisa's position in line, still addressing
the crowd;

REDCOAT
Once again, anyone who was scheduled
on the flight to Atlanta, if you
wanna get out of Dallas tonight,
come to the front of the line at
this time.

As several PASSENGERS finally get the message and scoot under
the ropes, an irate passenger in the b.g. steps out of line
and approaches the Redcoat.

IRATE PASSENGER
(to Redcoat)
Excuse me. You're letting them go,
but we've been standing here for
over an hour. How does that happen?

Lisa stares at the passenger, overhearing. She shakes her
head, sympathizing with the poor Redcoat.

REDCOAT
Sir, if we don't re-book 'em, they're
gonna miss their flight.

IRATE PASSENGER
So it doesn't matter that you canceled
my first flight, then re-routed me
twice --

REDCOAT
I understand, but -~

IRATE PASSENGER
Just get your boss, this is
ridiculous.

Lisa reflexively speaks up:

LISA
I understand, it's just that --

The irate passenger suddenly takes a step toward Lisa:

IRATE PASSENGER
Listen -~

Just then, the passenger standing behind Lisa intervenes,
stepping in between her and the passenger. He's pushing 30,
rugged good looks. Call him RIPPNER.

RIPPNER

Sir, please --

(re: Lisa)
She's right.

(re: the redcoat)
She's the only one standing between
us getting out of here and total
anarchy.

IRATE PASSENGER
But she's ~-

RIPPNER

She's exhausted, she's worked 18
hours straight, and she suspects we
all hate her just as much as you do.
So whaddaya say we give her a pass,
and let her go back to a job I’m
betting's a lot more thankless than
yours.

There's something in Rippner's eyes that makes the irate
passenger hesitate -- something that says there's only one
right answer to Rippner's proposal.

The irate passenger holds Rippner's gaze another beat, then
retreats to his place in line.

This airline sucks.

stale nachos, a vacant barstool next to him. Off Lisa --

takes off her stained blouse, drops it in her carry-on, and
starts putting on a fresh one.

In the mirror, before her buttoning hides it again, we see a
two-inch SCAR near the base of her neck. Her eyes fall on
it just once, then flick quickly away.

Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security,
Charles Keefe, embarks on a seven-
day tour of southern port cities
starting tomorrow...

This as the passenger checks over his ticket, then turns to
watch the continuing TV NEWS REPORT on CHARLES KEEFE airing
behind him: :

REPORTER (cont'd)

-»-You may recall that four months
ago, Keefe sent shock waves through
the department when he made these
remarks at his first press conference:

ON THE TV

As cameras FLASH, CHARLES KEEFE speaks at a microphone-strewn
podium, the Homeland Security emblem hanging behind him.

CHARLES KEEFE

(on TV)
No, we're not waging a war against
“terrorism” anymore. Terrorism’s a
word, an abstract term. You can’t
fight that. What you fight are the
thugs who practice it, no matter who
they are, where they live, or what
they believe. I don’t discriminate,
I communicate. Just not always
with a kind word.

This gets a few 0.S. chuckles from the 0.S. Reporters.

CHARLES KEEFE (cont'd)
(then, with a wink, heading
away)
Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fan of
diplomacy, it can work... but you’ve
gotta have their attention first.
Thank you, thanks very much...

Scanning for her row, she holds her breath as she and we
take in the sight of passengers you pray you never sit next
to: a portly MAN, a WOMAN trying to calm her crying baby, a
20-something GUY shoveling down CHOW MEIN...

Lisa stops just shy of her row, waiting as a passenger stows
his luggage in the bins above the window seats. He then
takes his seat in the middle section, revealing

bin. Remember, she's had a couple.

Rippner grabs her arm, steadies her.

As a few more passengers file past, Rippner and Lisa notice
a 40ish attractive WOMAN struggling to lift her carry-on
into the middle overhead bin. The woman turns, sees Rippner,
her eyes pleading for help.

LISA
Bellhop to row 16.

Rippner, always the polite smile, gets up.

Yes, Ma'am.

Rippner moves to the woman. As he hoists her carry-on into
the bin, he GRIMACES, mostly for Lisa's benefit. Lisa smiles.

Rippner resumes his seat as Lisa eyes the nice LADY moving
down the aisle. The lady smiles, holds up the Dr. Phil book
with:

Lisa brings up her purse, takes out her cell phone, shuts it
off, stuffs it back inside. She puts her purse in her seat
pocket as the fluorescent cabin lights suddenly start to
SWITCH OFF. The cabin becomes VERY DARK. Only a few reading
lights remain on as most passengers opt to sleep.

Rippner flips on his reading light, punches some buttons on
a fancy, military-style watch with lots of sub dials and
push buttons. He sets the time FORWARD from 1:28 to 2:28

There's some STATIC. The phone suddenly CUTS OUT altogether
leaving us and Dad with just the silence of the house. Dad

eyes the cordless for a curious beat -- then sets it aside,

grabs the remote and clicks off the TV...

Hesitant another beat. Then ~-- she starts to reach for it,

Excuse me.

They look up. The 40ish woman is standing over them.

40ISH WOMAN (cont'd)
(to Rippner)
I'm sorry, would you help me again?
Last time, I promise.

An awkward beat. Rippner can't be a jerk. He hangs up the
air phone.

As he gets up, he stares Lisa down, RIPS her credit card out
of the airphone slot, TAKES HER PURSE from his seat pocket,
stuffs it in the overhead bin then moves to help the 40ish
woman.

ON LISA

Shifting her eyes around. The 40ish woman's bought her some
time to perhaps do something, but what -- Rippner just took
her purse, her cell phone -- Lisa starts sifting through the
contents of her seat pocket, looking for something to write
on...

NICE LADY (0.S.)
Hello again.

Lisa whips her head up to see the nice lady standing in the
aisle with the Dr. Phil book and a pink highlighter pen in
hand. She opens the book. We see some passages highlighted
as she explains:

these surveys he wants you to answer
about yourself before you read the
rest --

Lisa tries to re-focus. Her eyes shift to Rippner who
momentarily has his back turned taking the 40ish woman's
carry-on down from the overhead bin --

Lisa quickly reaches over, and as gently as she can, takes
the book and highlighter out of the nice lady's hands:

LISA
Oh, don't worry about the surveys, I
just -- let me highlight my favorite
part -~

NICE LADY
Oh. Wonderful. And give me your
address, too, I want to return the
favor.

Lisa flips the book open, starts scribbling furiously --

Turning back toward Lisa and the old lady as the 40ish woman
takes her sweet time rooting around in her carry-on.

BACK TO LISA

We see FLASHES of KEY WORDS she's writing: ...HELP ME...CALL
POLICE...

Over the above, the nice lady keeps rambling:

NICE LADY (cont'd)
I'll send you one of my favorites,
oh, what it's called now... oh yes,
"Noodle Knowledge" -- isn't that
funny? It takes you on a tour inside

Lisa's caught.

NICE LADY
I'm sorry, I'm blocking your seat.
RIPPNER
No worries.
Rippner just glares -- at Lisa. The nice lady scoots out of

the way toward the approaching cart. Rippner resumes his
seat. His eyes shift to the highlighter still in Lisa's
hand. He YANKS it away --

THE DRINK CART

is now practically on top of the lady --

she cuts across to the other row, heads back down the other
aisle.

RIPPNER
(watching the lady but
talking to Lisa)
I have to assume she’s gonna read
it...

Rippner watches the nice lady all the way. She puts the
book under her arm as she approaches the occupied aft
lavatory. She waits, starts to strike up a conversation
with another seated passenger.

RIPPNER (cont'd)
-- I didn't wanna get complicated,
Lisa.
(then; turning to her)
Start getting that --

LISA
(shaking with anger)
All I get is that this is wrong --

BAM! Rippner's forehead suddenly SMACKS Lisa's in a vicious
HEAD-BUTT that knocks her OUT COLD.

This as Rippner throws quick ‘glances toward the seats that
might be in his line of sight. But no one's looking. Most
still sleeping. The Headphone Kid's doing homework.
Rebecca's playing her gameboy.

Rippner turns back, shaking, adrenaline overload --

He reaches over, pulis a pillow from Lisa's seat pocket,
stuffs it between her head and the window.

He quickly glances aft again -—-

Still with the book under her arm, waiting outside the

He looks to Lisa again. No visible injury.

SENIOR FLT. ATTENDANT (0.5S.)
How's she doing?

Rippner turns back. The senior flight attendant’s standing
over him. He brings his hand up, covering the cut on his
forehead, acts like he's merely scratching his head.

RIPPNER
Much better now. Thanks.

As soon as the senior flight attendant moves off up the aisle,
Rippner quickly stands from his seat, flips off the reading
light --

We slowly FADE BACK IN --

Still out.

A sudden jolt of TURBULENCE causes her eyes to flutter ever
so slightly.

Another TREMOR. Lisa's eyes open, gradually bringing the
dark, blurry cabin into focus.

She's still disoriented, and we along with her, not entirely
sure how much time has passed --

Lisa slowly sits up, turns to see Rippner sitting in his
seat, thoroughly engrossed in the DR. PHIL BOOK.

Lisa fully awakens at the sight. Stunned. She looks back,
gets a glimpse of the nice lady who's sleeping in her seat.
Or so we hope.

TURBULENCE. Heavy. Continuous now. The kind that makes
even the most seasoned traveler wonder. A few LIGHTNING
FLASHES out the window. The seat belt signs BING to life.

Fact ~- you've been out for a half

A beat. Then -- Rippner holds out his fist to Lisa. She
eyes it as he turns it over, opens it to reveal -- TWO
ASPIRIN.

RIPPNER (cont'd)
You'll thank me later.

Lisa hesitates.
RIPPNER (cont'd)

It's aspirin, Leese. I need you
coherent, remember?

 

Another beat. Then Lisa holds out her hand. Rippner drops
the aspirin into it. He pulls a fresh bottled water from
her seat pocket, cracks it open, hands it to her. She downs
the aspirin. Takes a few swigs amidst more TURBULENCE.

LISA
(fighting her fear of
erashing)
If I do it, if I call, then you'll
call the person outside dad's house?
Tell him to go away?

Rippner smiles, sure now he's got her.

The engines ROAR LOUDER, the plane beginning its ascent...

This as Rippner RIPS the airphone out, takes Lisa's credit
ecard, inserts it in the phone. Studies the LCD SCREEN. It
flashes the "okay" to make the call.

RIPPNER
Now, I'll connect you to area code
305-555-Two Thousand.

Rippner dials as the TURBULENCE intensifies. Lisa's fighting
stark panic. Horrible turbulence, and the maniac in the

next seat. Rippner could care less. He puts the phone to
his ear. -- We hear a RING. Rippner hands the phone to

Lisa with:

 

RIPPNER (cont'd)
I don't have to tell you to sound --

LISA
You've said enough.

He hands her the phone. She puts it to her ear. We hear
another RING. Then -- the slightly GARBLED VOICE of CYNTHIA:

CYNTHIA (THROUGH PHONE)
Good morning, Lux Atlantic Resort,
this is Cynthia.

Lisa hesitates. Trying to contro] her emotions and welling
tears at the sound of this familiar voice.

conversation.

LISA (cont'd)
-- No, you're gonna need the pin...

As Lisa continues, Rippner turns away briefly, looks over to
the far left aisle to another PASSENGER who's using an air
phone.

Then he notices something peculiar -- the passenger suddenly
takes the phone from his ear, curiously looks at the LCD
sereen. Then hangs the phone up.

Rippner slowly turns his head back to Lisa:

LISA (cont'd)
Yeah, we're gonna put him in 4080. --
Right.

Rippner's eyes focus on the LCD screen: NO SERVICE.
But for some reason, Lisa's still talking...

LISA (cont'd)
Yeah, the pin's two-five-four-eight-

Suddenly, Rippner RIPS the phone out of Lisa's hand, puts it
to his ear -~-

RIPPNER
Hello, Cynthia? Helloooo?

DEAD AIR. Rippner turns the phone over, shows the LCD screen
to Lisa. Damn.

Rippner hangs it up. Play a beat of silence between Rippner
and Lisa. Then:

RIPPNER (cont'd)

Pretty clear thinking given the
circumstances. Let me guess. Stress
Management courses?

{off her silence)
Well, they're really paying off. We
come out of this, I might have to
steal you.

RIPPNER (cont'd)
Are the phones not working?

YOUNG FLT. ATTENDANT
Oh, they sometimes cut out during
storms. They'll probably come back
when we find some clear air.

She moves off toward first class. Rippner's visibly irritated
as he looks at his watch, then to the phone.

LISA
What, you don't have a back-up plan?

Rippner remains silent.

look)

She forces her body to turn around. She throws open the
toilet seat. Dry heaves. Convulses. Tears flowing. The
onset of an emotional meltdown that's long overdue.

Oh my God -- help me -- somebody

She tries to regulate her breathing. Grabs a bunch of toilet
paper and wipes her nose. Throws the paper in the bowl and
flushes, watching as the blue liquid swirls around the bowl.
Slams the lid shut.

One more deep breath gives her the strength to pull herself
to her feet. Her legs are still wobbly as she puts her hands
on the sink, her arms supporting most of her weight. Splashes
water on her face, drinks a little.

Then squirts some soft soap into her hand, about to rinse —-

As soon as the senior flight attendant has moved several

thrusts it out at her.

Holding her breath, she reaches for the cordless phone on

so she doesn't even breath as she does this.

She screams or we scream —— not important which — as Rippner
attacks, knife high. There’s a brief but terrifying struggle
— he’s slashing at her, feinting, thrusting... But she’s
also taking a toll on him — she’s damn fast with that stick
— she gets a couple of good ones — even catching him on
the wrist so hard that he loses control of the knife. It

But Rippner is far from out — there’s an even more personal
struggle as she swings again. Rippner sidesteps, grabs out
—- and suddenly has a grim hold on the stick.

This happens near the doorway to the hall. He spins her
around, slams her against the door (now it’s back wide open
again), flings her stick away — then they grapple. Both
nearly lose their balance, and they reel out through the
door onto the

SECOND FLOOR LANDING - CONTINUOUS 107D
Where Rippner SLAMS her against the wall --

But Lisa still has plenty of fight left —- she attempts a

knee to the groin, her hands claw for his eyes, but none of

it works. She’s pinned within moments. But she never takes

her eyes off him, never flinches or looks scared. Her face

is a study in fury and defiance.

It’s overwhelmingly clear that far from being afraid of him,
she’s just seeing him at last for what he is:

LISA
You're pathetic.

And it’s almost as if we see Rippner see himself in the mirror
of her eyes -~ He sees that, and he can’t bear to look at

it. In frustration, Rippner tosses Lisa UP and OVER the
railing. Lisa, wide-eyed, SCREAMS as she flips back, TUMBLING
DOWN THE STAIRCASE to the first landing in the

open, catching Rippner, out of focus, making his way down

Rippner kneels down to Lisa when the COCKING OF A GUN 0.8.

and pissed as all hell, has the gun trained steadily on him --
THWUMP. Dad FIRES a SILENCED ROUND, hitting Rippner in the
chest. The impact spins him around. He falls to his knees.
Exhaustion setting in. He slinks to the floor, rolls on his
back. Alive but beaten.
Dad advances, keeping the gun trained as he helps Lisa pull
herself up. She and Dad stand over Rippner as the outside
SIRENS CLOSE IN.
Off Lisa, looking down at Rippner...-

A suited DETECTIVE escorts Lisa into the lobby. She spots
CYNTHIA

talking to a couple of SUITS. Lisa heads toward her, the
detective clearing the path...

Cynthia looks over, sees Lisa. She smiles wide, races to
Lisa, a bit dazed but dealing with it.

LISA
Are you okay?

CYNTHIA
Oh yeah. I mean, I think we had a
really smooth night all things
considered. Just... that one incident

really.
LISA
Cynthia, you did really good.
CYNTHIA
Yeah?
- LISA
Yeah.

Keefe smiles, nods. His bodyguards quickly usher him away-
Lisa and Cynthia watch him go --

MARYANN TAYLOR (0.S-)
Lisa?

Lisa and Cynthia turn to see a fuming Bob and Maryann Taylor
making their way out, a BELLHOP and. cart following them.

MARYANN TAYLOR (cont'd)
Lisa?

Lisa and Cynthia eye each other, brace themselves.

MARYANN TAYLOR (cont'd)
Lisa, do you have any idea what we've
been through? First, no reservation,
and then I got chunks of plaster all
over me... I’1l probably get asthma...

LISA
(feigning concern)
I am so sorry, Mrs. Taylor, how can
we make it up to you?

. BOB TAYLOR

(ve: Cynthia)
First you clean house, starting with
her...

MARYANN TAYLOR
She’s completely incompetent.

BOB TAYLOR
Absolutely.

LISA
I see.

Lisa reaches behind the small CONCIERGE PODIUM, grabs a 5x8
comment card, hands it to Mr. Taylor.

LISA (cont'd)
Well here, why don’t you take this+-

BOB TAYLOR
A comment card? You want us to fill
out a comment card?

LISA

ahead and shove it up your ass-
(off the Taylor’s shock)
Thanks for staying with us.

Lisa doesn’t wait for a response. She quickly turns, pulis
Cynthia away.

CYNTHIA
You are so my hero.

As WE PULL BACK and AWAY, Lisa and Cynthia melting into the
crowd...

LISA
No, Cynthia, you are so mine.

CYNTHIA
You wanna hit the bar? I mean we
should make a toast to being alive
or something...

LISA
Good idea.

CYNTHIA
What are you in the mood for? .

LISA
Anything but a Bay Breeze.

FADE OUT.
