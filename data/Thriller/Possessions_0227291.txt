OPEN ON BLACK

A WOMAN'S VOICE speaks, softly, whispering:
. CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
There was once a little tailor, a
good and unremarkable man,

journeying through a forest. And as
he advanced into the dark...

SLOW FADE UP TO:

EXT. FAIRY TALE FOREST - DAY/NIGHT

Moonlight. A magical forest of trees. Diamond shards of
blue light on wrinkled, wormy roots. Over the mossy gorse,
steps --

A little TAILOR, with scissors, needles and thread hanging
from his belt. A glass key round his neck. And a tall,
grey hound beside him. He sees ahead --

A giant stone, where a crack opens up. The Tailor peers
inside. And squeezes down inside a dark tunnel. Which
leads out into --

INT. STONE CHAMBER - DAY/NIGHT

A shimmering hall of phosphorescent light. The Tailor sees
a tall glass dome; and a shining glass coffin, on a velvet
pall, surrounded by moths and butterflies.

The Tailor peers inside the glass dome, sees --

A miniature castle, with windows and battlements.

FROM POV - INSIDE GLASS COFFIN

The Tailor peers in, to see: a sleeping PRINCESS, her
breath ruffling her golden hair. In her hands: a box, like
a@ green ice egg.

BACK TO SCENE

The Tailor -- takes his glass key, slips it into the lock.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)

... And the little tailor thought
to bend and kiss her perfect cheek,
because he knew this was what he
must do...'

And kisses the Princess. She opens her eyes, full of
wonder.

PRINCESS
You must be the one I have been
waiting for. You must be the
prince.

TAILOR
No, you are mistaken. I ama
tailor. In search of work to keep
me alive.

The Princess laughs. And the sound of her laughter SHATTERS
the GLASS COFFIN into splinters. And on the box, CLOSE IN
and --

REVEREND (V.0.)

... I am the resurrection and the
life,' said Jesus. “He that
believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live...'

SLOW FADE UP TO a silvery BLACK AND WHITE --

EXT. CEMETERY (LONDON) - DAY (1888)

The box lies in the hands of a widow, MRS. ELLEN ASH, in
front of a mausoleum. It's a dripping November day, sun low
in the sky.

Ellen lifts back her veil to kiss the box. Which she places
inside -- a wrought iron vault. Its doors close.

REVEREND
Let the body and soul of Randolph
Henry Ash lie in eternal peace,
mourned by his sorrowing widow
Ellen...

PULL BACK to see Ellen and mourners, men in black hats and
cloaks like silk-clad ravens round an Egyptian-style vaulted
tomb. Ellen focuses on the box behind a metal grille. HOLD
ON -- the box.

As before our eyes, the box and tomb rapidly --

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Age a hundred years. Roses wither and die. Moss, weeds,
leaves, briars, tendrils of undergrowth push and coil ‘round
the grille.

REVEREND (V.0.)
honored not only by those of the
year of our Lord 1888, but by all of
time...

And as a wind blows leaves, FADE UP TO --

EXT. LONDON STREETS (BLOOMSBURY) - DAY (PRESENT)

The spinning wheel of a bicycle. The spokes blur in
a constant motion, giving an illusion of stillness.
As --

Suddenly VIVID COLOR and SHRIEK of CAR HORNS --

A young man weaves perilously ‘round a worm of traffic. In
anorak and cycle clips, ROLAND MICHELL, thirtyish, dodges
down back streets, cutting through into --

EXT. BRITISH MUSEUM - DAY

Roland wheels his bicycle to sheds, removes his clips.
Oblivious to his trousers splashed by mud. He unpacks his
bicycle panniers. Heads through a side entrance into!--

INT. BRITISH MUSEUM - DAY

Roland walks down a long corridor, leading through to an
ECHOING domed hall. He pauses by a party of TEACHER and
school-kids in front of a statue of an eminent Victorian:
Randolph Henry Ash.

CLOSEUP - STATUE

Roland stares fondly up at the stern features of Ash gazing
lifelessly out over the kids' bored faces.

BACK TO SCENE

TEACHER
Poet, philosopher, naturalist,
statesman, Randolph Henry Ash was
one of our most eminent literary
heroes...
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

TEACHER (CONT'D)

‘ whose famous love poems to his
wife Ellen are among the most
glorious jewels of our literary
heritage. From the Victorian age,
only Browning and Tennyson --!

(to unruly kids)
Pay attention, Kylie --!

Who stare amusedly at Roland's nerdy appearance, cycling
helmet still on. He slips unnoticed down a side stair-well,
entering --

INT. BRITISH MUSEUM BASEMENT - ASH FACTORY - DAY

Through a door marked, "Ash Institute: Director Professor
James Blackadder." This is the "Ash Factory": <A basement
of corridors, in institutional grot. Strip lighting,
peeling paint-work.

PAOLA, a fifty-something secretary with moth-like glasses,
glances up at Roland.

PAOLA
‘Morning, Roland. Blackadder's in a
panic. Mortimer Cropper has landed.

ROLAND
Oh, God. Did Blackadder finish my
reference? I asked him weeks ago.

PAOLA
I reminded him. But you know what
he's like when Cropper's in town.

ROLAND
I must talk to Blackadder. He knows
since he gave that job to Fergus...

PAOLA
Accident?

Notices his ruined trousers, on her way to the photocopier.
ROLAND
(hadn't noticed before)
Oh... my bicycle, I suppose.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Roland puts down his panniers, squeezes past Paola into the
pantry. He flicks on the kettle. Looks for his coffee mug.

ROLAND
Who's been using my mug?

As he unscrews the coffee jar, waiting for the kettle to
boil, he turns to see at the door, a grey-haired woman,
staring at him.

BEATRICE
If you have a minute, Roland...

This is Dr. BEATRICE NEST, doyenne of Ellen Ash studies and
Keeper of the Ash Museum, an eccentric spinsterish scholar.

ROLAND
Actually, Beatrice, I was about to
get started on those Ash
footnotes!--!

BEATRICE
It's important. It's about Ellen...

Ominous silence. Roland registers Beatrice's insistence.
She disappears down the hall. Roland has to follow her into

--!

INT. MUSEUM - ASH FACTORY - BEATRICE'S ROOM - DAY

A musty cavern of cardboard boxes and yellowing papers.
Behind them, almost bricked in, sits Beatrice. Who flings a
letter over to Roland.

BEATRICE
I can't bear it. Another letter
from that impossible woman, Leonora
Stern. She wants a piece from me
for some ghastly new journal about
Ellen Ash's sexual relations --

ROLAND
With... Ash?
BEATRICE
With anyone. This woman's obsessed

with sex.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

ROLAND
You protect Ellen from questionable
suitors, Beatrice. I've always
admired that.

BEATRICE
Ellen was a faithful wife. And I'm
faithful to her. She needs
protection. I'm the only one now
who cares...

NOISES in the corridor. Two academics poke their noses in.
One, his rival, a trendy young lecturer, FERGUS WOLF; the

other, a bluff elderly Scottish professor, JAMES BLACKADDER,
Roland's boss.

FERGUS
Hi, Roland. Still here?

ROLAND
Fergus..
(beat)
Congratulations on your
appointment...

Downcast, Roland shrinks back in defeat. Blackadder
blusters in.

BLACKADDER
Ah, Roland... I want you at the
London Library. Come along,
Cropper's in town for the auction...

Blackadder whisks Roland out from the room.

INT. MUSEUM - ASH FACTORY CORRIDORS - DAY

They walk down the corridor with Fergus, Blackadder putting
on his coat.

ROLAND
I feel sorry for poor Beatrice.
Even the feminists hate her now for
championing a dull wife --

BLACKADDER
(exasperated)
Beatrice Nest and her bloody letters
of Ellen Ash are completely
irrelevant to modern scholarship.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

BLACKADDER (CONT'D)
She's wasted twenty-five years
looking up every recipe for
gooseberry jam and jaunt to
Broadstairs. That's what I get for
hiring a Ph.D from...
(can barely say it)
New Zealand.

FERGUS
The old witch. She's the best
keeper of the Ash Museum you'll find

BLACKADDER
Yes. Like Ellen, Beatrice is best
behind closed doors...

Blackadder and Fergus swoop off. Roland watches them go,
turns ‘round to see -- Beatrice scurry back into her room
like a crab. Obviously overheard their comments. Roland
sighs --

CUT TO:

EXT. LONDON STREETS (PICCADILLY) - DAY

The spinning wheel. On his bicycle, with his panniers and
clips, Roland swerves through noisy traffic, heading for --

EXT. LONDON LIBRARY (ST. JAMES'S SQUARE) - DAY (PRESENT)

An elegant London square. Roland cycles in as leaves blow
from a tall tree towards a vast Victorian library, where
people leave by stone steps, armfuls of books. As Roland
parks his bike --

Some LEAVES float away, tumble towards a skylight on the
library roof TAPPING like birds trying to enter, as --
INT. LONDON LIBRARY - HALL - DAY

Roland enters the shabby hall. Bespectacled scholars

shuffle around in a silent hum. Roland seems suddenly "at
home." All around him, wasted lifetimes devoted to books...
INT. LONDON LIBRARY - STACKS - DAY

Roland navigates like a mole accustomed to the dark through
amaze of metal shelves. Hidden stairs and tiny corridors
like a Piranesi prison, books piled high: dark, dusty,
infinite...

Roland seems to know his way, even in the dark...

INT. LONDON LIBRARY - BASEMENT - RARE BOOKS DEPARTMENT -
DAY

Zig-zagging through a labyrinth of books, Roland emerges
down in the basement. He knocks at a door marked "Rare
Books 5." No reply, so he enters --

A musty room like a pharaoh's tomb, a high window casting
light into a cell of vellum and leather. Roland puts files
down.

ROLAND
My name's Dr. Michell, Roland
Michell. You have a copy of Donne's
poetry for me. An 1858 edition.

A pebble-glassed LIBRARIAN emerges, crooked as his tottering
piles of books. Slightly deaf, he takes his time.

LIBRARIAN
You ordered it through Professor
Blackadder over at the Ash
Institute?

ROLAND
Correct. I'm working on the
Complete Works edition with him.

LIBRARIAN
I didn't know Ash was an admirer of
Donne?

ROLAND

He quoted one of Donne's poems on
his deathbed. I'm checking
references in the Nineteenth Century
editions... just to be sure.

The Librarian finds Roland's book, bound with tape. He
wipes away black dust, hands it over. Roland sits down,
cracks pages apart.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

LIBRARIAN
Doesn't look like it's been touched
for a while. I'll check...

Flicking through, Roland sees notes scrawled in the margins.

CLOSEUP - HANDWRITING

BACK TO SCENE
It intrigues him.

ROLAND
Someone's scrawled notes all over
the margins.

LIBRARIAN

Hm...? Well... it's never been
called for, as far as I know...

(checks file cards, as

Roland reads)
Odd... According to our records,
this edition was bequeathed to us by
Ash's widow, Ellen.

ROLAND
You mean this copy belonged to Ash
himself? Someone must have
consulted it before now.

LIBRARIAN
Seems it was lost in our filing
system...

Intrigued, Roland goes back to cutting leaves. With great
delicacy he cuts open a set of pages, suddenly two old
letters fall to the floor. Roland bends down to pick them

up --

LIBRARIAN
(rambling on)
. Devil and Demonology, Dogs,
Domestic Servants and... Donne...'
(beat)
You can lose anything in here. I
found a set of false teeth once...

Roland isn't listening. Dazzled by a thin shaft of
sunlight, Roland starts to read. On yellowing PAPER, a
sound of a PEN SCRATCHING.

(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
And Ash's voice -- deep, intimate -- OVER:

ASH (V.0.)

... Dear madam, Excuse this letter
to a stranger. Yet since our
pleasant and unexpected conversation
at Crabb Robinson's party, I have
thought of nothing else...'

 

On hearing Ash's voice, Roland turns the letters over. Like
a spell, the voice stops. Roland stares hard at the
letters, then looks back at the Librarian. Concealing the
letters from view.

Warily, Roland turns the letters over again. As Roland
reads the next passage, his expression changes to wonder.

ASH (V.0.)
... I feel, I know with a certainty
that cannot be mistaken, that you
and I must speak again...'

He reads on, silently. Then turns the letters over again.
He folds back the book to the front paper: A signature
"Randolph Henry Ash." Roland pulls the letter up beside the
signature --

ROLAND
Incredible...
CLOSEUP - LETTER/SIGNATURE

A match.

BACK TO SCENE

Like a great poker hand, Roland can't believe his luck.
Suddenly alive, confused, palpitating, he looks ‘round.

LIBRARIAN
Hm...? Found anything interesting?

EXTREME CLOSEUP ON ROLAND
deliberating. His heartbeat seems to pause. Time stops,
his whole life converges in a single moment: Life or death,

truth or lie, a simple "Yes" or "No":

ROLAND
No. Nothing really...
ll.
BACK TO SCENE

Guiltily, Roland slides the letters into his copy of
Poems of R.H. Ash. And slips the book beneath his arm, as -

A loud KNOCKING sound CARRIES OVER from --

AUCTIONEER (V.0.)
Sold once... sold twice...

INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE (LONDON) - DAY

A hammer bangs on a gavel as an AUCTIONEER closes a deal.
In a panelled room, a crowd of buyers sit waiting, some
poised on phones, others with catalogues: Victorian
Literary Memorabilia.

AUCTIONEER
Sold for a hundred and twenty-five
thousand guineas...

The tall, handsome buyer, acknowledges the Auctioneer:
MORTIMER CROPPER, U.S. scholar, collector, master of the Ash
universe. Nearby, the elderly LORD ASH, and his wastrel
son, HILDEBRAND.

AUCTIONEER
... Letters and memorabilia of
Randolph Henry Ash, including
wedding rings belonging to the poet
and his wife... to Professor
Cropper.

Behind him, Blackadder and Fergus Wolf exchange glances.
Cropper acknowledges Blackadder, turns to Lord Ash.

CROPPER
We can rest easy, Lord Ash. The
wedding rings are secured for the
Ash Collection.

LORD ASH
You beat the Japanese again?
CROPPER
Of course, sir. We have very ample
funds.
LORD ASH

(repeating vaguely)
Very ample funds...

Lord Ash smiles. Cropper comments to Hildebrand.

(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:

CROPPER
Pleased to see your father so happy.

HILDEBRAND
Money always excites him.

CROPPER
Then we should go. No more buried
treasure here. Your father's very
frail.

HILDEBRAND
But not frail enough.

Envy in his voice, as Cropper collects the rings. He wheels
Lord Ash's chair to the exit. Blackadder and Fergus gossip.

FERGUS
You have to hand it to Cropper,
repackaging Ash as a New Victorian.
All moral rigor and family values.
Pure opportunism! --

BLACKADDER
Now Newsweek picked it up, the old
goat thinks he'll get a Pulitzer for
his book. Hideous...
(beat)
But I wouldn't trust anyone, faced
with Cropper's loot...

Blackadder rushes up to Cropper.

BLACKADDER
Congratulations, Professor Cropper.

CROPPER
Ah, Professor... Dr. Wolf... Look at
these rings. Wonderful things...

He proudly holds up the rings before them. All look on.

CROPPER
I remember when my father would
amuse himself by placing the
treasures of his own collection in
my sweaty paw...

(CONTINUED)
13.

CONTINUED:
CROPPER (CONT'D)
(stroking his palm;
sensuously)
‘ “Here, Morty, my boy,' he would
say. “Here is history to hold in
your hand.' Priceless...
BLACKADDER
Surely a strain even for your
budget.

Effortlessly superior, Cropper smiles condescendingly.
CROPPER

At the Cropper Foundation, we don't

have a budget. Just a check book.
Blackadder, Fergus watch him wheel Lord Ash out.
EXT. ROLAND'S FLAT (STOKE NEWINGTON) - SPINNING BICYCLE
WHEEL - NIGHT
Roland rides up the lanes of rundown Stoke Newington.
Outside a tall Victorian house, Roland stops, brings his
bicycle up steps. Opens his doors, and enters --
INT. ROLAND'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Locking his bicycle in the hall, he picks up a pile of mail.
And wearily goes down the stairs into the basement.

INT. ROLAND'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Portraits of Randolph Henry Ash stare down at a kitchen
table. CATS gather, MIAOWING for food, as --

VAL, his long-time girl friend, sets down before Roland a
plate of lamb and ratatouille. It's reheated, and like
their relationship, tepid, and potentially poisonous.

ROLAND

Shall I get a bottle of wine?
VAL

You should've thought of that

before.
Roland dutifully picks at the meat. Then --

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

14.

ROLAND
I made an amazing discovery today!--

VAL
It'll go cold.

ROLAND
I was in the London Library. I
found Ash's own copy of Donne poems
with all his notes in the margins.
And I'm sure no one knew it was
there --

VAL
I expect they didn't.

ROLAND
... If I tell Blackadder, I know
he'll think it's important --

VAL
I expect he will.

Roland sees the bad mood. Like a storm gathering strength.

ROLAND
I'm sorry to bore you, Val. It does
look exciting. I can write it up.
It'll make me a better job prospect

VAL
There are no jobs. And if there
are, they go to Fergus Wolf --

Val gets up from the table. Roland dutifully prods the

lamb.

ROLAND
If you think what I do is so
unimportant --

VAL
(lighting a cigarette)
You do what turns you on. You have
this thing about this dead man. Who
had a thing about dead people.
That's okay, but not everyone is
very bothered about all that...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

VAL (CONT'D)
(draws on cigarette)
I see some things, from my
menial vantage point in my lawyer's
office. Last week, when Euan and I

Roland starts to feed cats below the table.

ROLAND
Who...?

VAL
A lawyer. In my office... Oh, never
mind.

Val turns to him. At first slowly, calmly. Then louder...

VAL
I suppose I envy you, piecing
together old Ash's world picture.
Only where does that leave you, old
mole? What's your world picture?
And how are you ever going to afford
to get us away from dripping cat-

piss and being on top of one
another?!

Roland stares, stricken by Val's show of temper.

ROLAND
Something's upset you, hasn't it?

VAL
Seems a reasonable deduction.
EXT./INT. ROLAND'S FLAT (STOKE NEWINGTON) - BEDROOM -
NIGHT
Three A.M. Outside a dilapidated Victorian house, a breeze
RUSTLES through a tree's LEAVES. MOVE IN THROUGH a WINDOW,
where Val lies in bed, alone. Outside the bedroom --

INT. ROLAND'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sitting on the lowered loo seat, Roland goes over the
letters. He stares at the handwriting, hears Ash's voice.

(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:

ASH (V.0.)
. Dear Madam, Excuse this letter
to a stranger...'

RUSTLED by WIND, with a strange, harmonic MUSIC, the letters
hover delicately in his hands. Haunted by Roland's...

DREAM - EXT. HOUSE - CRABB ROBINSON PARTY
(BLACK & WHITE) - DAY

 

As Ash escorts Ellen into the house, he carries on through a
party, inside a conservatory of Oriental plants which
conceal guests playing blind man's bluff. Ash sees a WOMAN,
head turned away.

ON that look --

ASH (V.0.)

Since our pleasant and
unexpected conversation at Crabb
Robinson's party, I have thought of
nothing else...'

Ash is drawn towards the Woman -- FREEZE ON his expression,
his features turn as if to stone, as --

END OF DREAM.

INT. UNIVERSITY OF LONDON LIBRARY - AT DESK - NEXT DAY

Crisp pages of a yellowing volume. Roland reads the journal
of Crabb Robinson. An entry under 1858.

CRABB ROBINSON (V.0.)

June 18, 1858. My breakfast
party went off very well indeed. I
had with me: Mr. Bagehot, Mr. Ash,
Mrs. Jameson... Professor Spear,
Mrs. Lees, Miss La Motte and her
friend Miss Glover, the last
somewhat taciturn...'

Roland locks up, scribbles a note: "Christabel La Motte."
He dreamily sees --

FLASHBACK - EXT. CRABB ROBINSON'S HOME (RUSSELL

SQUARE) (BLACK & WHITE) - DAY (1858)

In the conservatory, Ash, as before, walking towards a
Woman, turned away from him (and us).

(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:

The host, CRABB ROBINSON, a mustachioed aesthete, observes
his guests.

CRABB ROBINSON (V.0.)
Ash had never met Miss La
Motte, who spoke more forcefully
than I expected. She is
surprisingly handsome when
animated...'

In BLACK AND WHITE we see as distant shadows -- Ash with a
Woman -- Christabel La Motte -- and behind her, another
Woman -- BLANCHE GLOVER, an attractive, but less confident
artist.

CRABB ROBINSON (V.0.)

. We all discussed with Mrs. Lees
her claim to have conversed with the
spirit of Charlotte Bronte... Mr.
Ash appealed to Miss La Motte on the
question of visions and second
sight; she declined to express an
opinion, answering only with a Mona
Lisa smile.'

From Ash and Christabel's smile: Rapturous, intense...
END _OF FLASHBACK.
CUT TO:

CLOSEUP
as Roland double-underlines the name "Christabel La Motte."

He takes his slip of paper to --

INT. UNIVERSITY OF LONDON LIBRARY - INDEX - DAY

Standing in a catalogue room, trousers still coiled by
bicycle clips, Roland flicks through the cards in a
gargantuan index. Under "L," he rummages until he finds the
reference...

ON CARD
ROLAND
(mumbling)
La... La... La... La Motte.

(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:

"La Motte, Christabel 1825-1890. Poet, critic."

ROLAND

jots down a reference: 719.640. Moves down to related
literature. Roland holds a card at arm's length. From
behind, a voice:

FERGUS (0.8.)
I didn't know you had an interest in
Christabel La Motte...

Roland turns, sees Fergus peering over his shoulder. Fergus
reaches over to investigate the card. And laughs.

ROLAND
I don't. I never heard of her until
now.
(beat)
Why did you laugh?

FERGUS

You're looking for an involuntary
expert. There are two people in the
world who know all about Christabel
La Motte. One is Professor Leonora
Stern from Tallahassee. The real
expert is Doctor Maud Bailey at
Lincoln. Cropper and I met them
both in Paris. A conference on
sexuality and textuality.

(beat)
A formidable pair... they have quite
a thing together.

. ROLAND
A “thing'?
FERGUS
I don't think they like men.
ROLAND
Oh, dear.
FERGUS

Maud runs a resource center up there
in Lincoln. Cropper's funding it.
They've got Christabel's papers
there. If you want anything, that's
where to look.

(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:

ROLAND
I might. Thanks. What's she like?

FERGUS
Unreadable. The feminists are
interested in her. Wrote a poem
about a fairy who married a mortal
for a soul --

ROLAND
I meant Dr. Bailey... Will she eat
me up?

Fergus considers briefly. A lot of undecodable feeling.

FERGUS
She thicks men's blood with cold.

ON Roland's look, a mix of intrigue and worry --

EXT. LINCOLN UNIVERSITY - NEXT DAY

The beautiful face of MAUD BAILEY: pale and cool, like a
marble statue. Blonde hair up, Maud stands in a doorway of
a modern campus block, as past campus fountains and lawns --

Roland walks toward her. As he closes in, he is drawn in by
her beauty. He recognizes it, yet cannot even admit it.

She is middle-class, beautiful, confident: everything he
dare not aspire to.

MAUD
You must be Dr. Michell?

ROLAND
Yes... Roland...

Maud offers him her long, cool hand. Roland puts down his
briefcase, shakes her hand.

MAUD
I hope you haven't wasted your
journey, Dr. Michell.

With neither a word nor a smile, Maud turns, walks into the
faculty building. Roland takes a step, remembers his
briefcase. Turns back to pick it up, and has to --

Catch up with Maud, now several steps ahead, opening a door
to --
20.
INT. FACULTY HALL (LINCOLN UNIVERSITY) - DAY

In a new building of beige wood and tinted glass, Maud walks
with Roland towards an elevator. Young, punky female
students walk past, rings in their noses, holding hands.
Roland sees no men.

MAUD
On the phone you said you found a
connection between Randolph and Ash
and one of my poets.

ROLAND
I found a draft of a letter in one
of Ash's books. I thought it might
be to Christabel La Motte.

MAUD
What sort of letter?

ROLAND
A love letter, I think.

MAUD
Hard to believe. Where's your
evidence?

Maud presses the button for the elevator. They wait.

ROLAND
There was a breakfast party, June
18, 1858. At the home of Crabb
Robinson. I believe they met one
another there --

MAUD
You can never rely on Crabb
Robinson. He was a notorious
gossip, always inventing things...

The ELEVATOR PINGS, opens doors. Maud and Roland step
inside.

ROLAND
Of course, but he has some curious
details...

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Inside the elevator, Roland and Maud are uncomfortably close
together, as they go down into the resource center's
basement.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

el.

ROLAND
: He says Ash and Christabel
discussed each other's poems. And
met the spiritualist Mrs. Lees. It
sounded plausible to me. In 1861,
Ash wrote Mummy Possest after a
seance --

MAUD
My Christabel was interested in
spiritualism. But I don't think Ash
would have appealed to her. His
poem is full of hatred for women --

ROLAND
Then it's probably a wild goose
chase. As you said.
(beat)
I hope you don't think I've made all
this up. This relationship --

_ MAUD
You said connection.' Now it's a
relationship?

ROLAND

Between two people. Two human
beings. Isn't that normally called
a relationship?

MAUD
Depends. I think your theory is way
off the mark. It sounds, frankly, a
little bizarre.

Maud turns away, heads off into the library. Roland follows

her.

ROLAND
I need to cross-reference it with
her journal. You did say Christabel
kept a journal...

MAUD
No. But we have a diary by a friend
of Christabel. An artist, Blanche
Glover...

ROLAND
Crabb Robinson mentions Miss Glover.
Who was she?

(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:

Maud picks up interest. The ELEVATOR PINGS, doors open.
They walk out of the elevator, towards the library doors.

MAUD
Blanche was Christabel's housemate -
- and most certainly her lover.

In front of the doors, Roland hangs back. Maud holds the
door open.

ROLAND
Am I allowed in?

MAUD
Naturally.

INT. LIBRARY (LINCOLN UNIVERSITY) - RESOURCE CENTER - DAY

On a desk, Maud brings out a box of musty manuscripts. She
picks a single volume, places it on the desk in front of
Roland. A thick, green, leather-bound notebook.

MAUD
Blanche's diary was among
Christabel's papers when she died.
Leonora is looking for a grant to
have it edited. She's found a
researcher from France who's
interested. But we can't go through
everything...

ROLAND
Then I'll let you know what I find.

Maud is about to go. She relents, giving in to her
curiosity.

MAUD
I checked my files before you
arrived. Christabel only referred
to Ash. In a letter she wrote to
William Rosetti, towards the end of

her life.
(beat)

It was... if anything... hostile.
(beat)

You have a couple of hours.

Roland sits at a desk. Illuminated by a shaft of overhead
light.

ON COVER

A gilded dove, flying out from a keyhole. He opens the
lavishly-illustrated book, with marbled endpapers.

"A Journal of Our Home-Life In Our House in Richmond"
By Blanche Glover
Commenced on the day of our Setting up House
May Ist, 1853."

As Roland flicks to June 1858, her writing is decorated with
pretty drawings, slowly merging into swirling, macabre

BLANCHE (V.0.)

... June 18, 1858. We went out to
breakfast at Mr. Crabb Robinson's
home. Present were Mr. Bagehot,
Mrs. Lees, Mr. Ash the poet, though
without Mrs. Ash, who was
indisposed...'

In his mind's eye -- Roland tries to penetrate a misty cloud

FLASHBACK - EXT. CRABB ROBINSON'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE)
(SILVER NITRATE BLACK & WHITE) - DAY (1858)

In a garden conservatory, Ash moves towards a beautiful
woman, back turned away from him. Behind her, as Ash draws
closer is --

A woman, we now recognize as -- BLANCHE GLOVER.

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... The Princess was much admired
and rightly...'

Ash is intercepted by HELLA LEES, a spiritualist. Who
introduces the beautiful woman: CHRISTABEL LA MOTTE, a
beguiling pre-Raphaelite brunette.

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... She professed to like Mr. Ash's
poem Ragnarok greatly. Which
naturally flattered him...'

Christabel returns Ash's smile. Modestly flirtatious, she
is drawn into his orbit, staring deep into his eyes.

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... This famous poet would have
been much surprised to know my true
opinion...'

(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
Blanche watches Ash walk with Christabel away from her.

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... But I smiled and nodded as best
I might, keeping my thoughts to
myself.
(beat)
I desired to be at home.'

Blanche holds in her hand a book, with an embossed gilded
dove on its cover. Then --

INTERCUT WITH:

ROLAND

Checking the clock, flips through yellowing pages of
Blanche's journal, filled with portraits of Christabel.

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... My Princess is much exercised
about a long letter which arrived
today, which she did not show me,
but smiles over, and caught up and
folded away...'

Slowly her portraits change into macabre drawings of
serpents and goblins. Roland returns to a page he's
skimmed:

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... Letters, letters letters...'

INT. BLANCHE & CHRISTABEL'S HOUSE (1858) - DUSK

In the hallway, a pile of letters. Christabel picks them
up, heads upstairs. Followed at a distance, by Blanche:

Her face brooding and suspicious. As Christabel drops a

letter --

Blanche picks it up, goes to the door, confronts her with
it. Christabel runs upstairs, sobbing...

BLANCHE (V.0.)

'... Not for me. You need not hurry
them away...'

INSIDE HER ROOM

Christabel hides letters in her sewing basket, folds them
under handkerchieves. Outside, through the keyhole --

(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... I am no sneak, no Governess.
From that fate you rescued me, my
Princess, as I shall rescue you from
yours...'

Blanche spies in.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - IN IRIS

Her eye large, unblinking. Blanche moves back, stares out
the window. The panes frame her face. A storm is
beginning. By candlelight --

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... Now we have a prowler...'

Blanche sees tree shadows move across windows. RAIN and
WIND HOWL outside. WINDOW FRAMES RATTLE, Blanche's anger
mounts. As branches scrape over windows --

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... I hear him out there. A wolf
at the door...'

Blanche watches as from outside something BANGS against a
door. A low moan of CRACKING WOOD. A latch is BATTERED
until ready to give. In a reflection, Blanche sees --

BLANCHE (V.0.)
'... This peeping Tom has put his
eye to our walls. Now he peers
shamelessly in...!

A man's face -- Ash -- BOOM! A sudden GUST OF WIND.

Windows and shutters are blown in -- rain pours through. A
silhouette -- a face like Ash. Then the WINDOW BURSTS open

Splinters of glass fly towards Blanche --
SMASH CUT TO:

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Silence. Dusk has turned to night. Beneath an isolated
pool of overhead light, Roland looks up from the diary into
darkness. Among the shelves, a shadow stirs. From the
darkness --

MAUD
Did you find anything?

(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
Maud steps into the light. Stunned, Roland closes the book.

ROLAND
I think so.

Alone together in the deserted library. Unexpectedly
intimate, even erotic. Maud perches on a desk.

ROLAND
Do you know about this prowler
Blanche was so worried about? The
wolf at the door?

MAUD
You think it may have been Ash? You
saw her drawings. Blanche had a
vivid imagination.

On the desk, Roland and Maud flick through Blanche's macabre
drawings of labial flowers and serpents' tongues.

ROLAND
And was jealous.

MAUD
Possibly. If Christabel was her
lover. Lovers do get jealous, don't
they?

ROLAND
What happened to Blanche?

MAUD
She drowned in the Thames, shortly
after completing this book.
Suicide. Christabel was distraught.
It was all very sad.
(beat)
But it's getting late.

ROLAND
I need to find out what happened
next.

MAUD
Sorry, not tonight. The center's
closed.

Roland looks at Maud. Realizes now or never.

ROLAND
Then I'd better explain.

(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:

Roland takes out the two stolen letters from his pocket. He
tosses them on the table. Maud starts to read them.

ROLAND
I found these. They're in Ash's
handwriting.
MAUD
You're sure they're authentic?
ROLAND
I've checked. They're dated June
19, 1858.
MAUD
The day after Crabb Robinson's
party.
ROLAND

Precisely. If I can find something
definite, they could change our
whole idea of Ash.

(beat)
And perhaps of Christabel.

Maud's pulse quickens. She finishes, looks up, regaining
her composure. Senses their importance.

ROLAND
I haven't shown them to anyone else.
No one else knows they exist. I
found them in a book in the London

Library.
MAUD
You stole them -- ?
ROLAND

I don't think they're mine, or
anything. But they're not Cropper's
or Blackadder's or Lord Ash's
either. Don't you see? My Ash
lived a quiet and exemplary married
life. Now, suddenly...

(beat)
A love letter to an unknown woman.

As Roland ties himself in knots, Maud is coolly accusatory.

MAUD
I suppose they might represent a
considerable academic scoop. For
you.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

28.

ROLAND
Well, I wanted to be the one who
does the work...
(realizes her
insult)
... Wait a minute -- it wasn't like
that.
MAUD
I'm sorry. I'd never have the nerve
to do that. Steal them...

ROLAND
It was an impulse. For the first
time, I felt Ash was alive in those
letters. It was incredible. That's
why I need you to find out the truth
about Ash and Christabel --

MAUD
You know Cropper funds the center.
If he finds out --

ROLAND
He won't. If you don't tell him.

MAUD
I can't let you Xerox Blanche's
diary. The spine won't stand it.
Maybe you could copy it out. I need
to think.

ROLAND
You can't throw me out.
MAUD
Can I book you a guest room?
ROLAND
I don't have any money.
MAUD
I thought you were working for
Blackadder.
ROLAND

Part-time. I also wash dishes in a
restaurant.

Maud mulls it over.

(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:

MAUD
You'd better come back to my place.
(beat)
You can sleep on my sofa.

Roland looks at the diary. The traces of the faded brown
writing. As Maud's hand rests close by.

INT. MAUD'S FLAT - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Outside in the hall, Maud collects bedding, plays back an
ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE from Cropper, as in her sitting
room --

Photographers from Leonora, letters from the Cropper
Foundation. An illustrated book has been left open for him
on her desk.

MAUD (0.S.)
I found something for you. A first
edition of Christabel's poem, The
Fairy Melusina that Blanche
illustrated...

ROLAND
Can I read it?

MAUD (0.S.)
Yes. It's very beautiful. Critics
still dismiss her poetry. But I
always found it strange and
powerful. There's one passage about
a woman who'd give anything for a
child, even a hedgehog, and duly
gives birth to a monster...

Roland looks at the macabre illustration. As Maud enters.

ROLAND
I think Blanche is sorry for the
hedgehog.

MAUD
Is she?

(impressed by Roland's

insight, Maud

examines a picture)
Yes, maybe you're right. Leonora
thought it was related to
Frankenstein, the product of Mary
Shelley's horror of birth --

(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:

ROLAND
Thanks. I'll read it. Perhaps
it'll help me sleep...
(realizing his
mistake)
I didn't mean it like that.

Maud throws him blankets. Glares at him.

MAUD
See you in the morning. There's a
train every hour.

Maud closes the door. Roland lies on the couch, listening
to her in the next room. He settles down, picks up the book
of Christabel's poetry, starts to read. In shadowy darkness

DISSOLVE THROUGH IRIS TO:

EXT. FOREST OF ARDEN ("FAIRY MELUSINA LAND") - DAY

EMERGE as the IRIS OPENS OUT INTO a strange dreamlike place
of Christabel's secret imagination: a dark, sinister
fairyland where owls cry, wolves howl. Through an enchanted
silver forest --

A distant KNIGHT in armor dismounts his weary blood-
spattered horse. Over, Christabel whispers her poem:

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
'... A draggled knight came riding
through the trees,
Behind him fear, before him
darkest night...'

The knight hears a song from a hollow chamber: Inside a
glass coffin, bound by silver chains and sapphire ropes,
lies a fairy princess in white silk. She holds a goblet up
to the Knight:

KNIGHT (V.0.)
'... What I shall become, I know
not.
But I crave a place of rest,
A draught of water, for I choke
on dust...'

The Knight pulls back thorny briars, steps into the mossy
hollow. He shatters the glass coffin, magically exploding
into shimmering splinters. The Knight lets the liquid drop
on his tongue, and --

(CONTINUED)
Sl.
CONTINUED:

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)

'... All one long look consumed
his soul

Into desire beyond the reach of
hope,

Beyond the touch of doubt or
despair,

So that he was one thing, and all
he was --'

As the Knight kisses her, her golden hair wraps itself
around him -- silver chains and emerald ropes bind his
limbs, cut through his armor -- from her mouth a serpent's
tongue darts out --

Plucks his eyeballs from behind his chain mail visor. As
the Knight lets out a painful roar, which freezes --

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. MAUD'S FLAT - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

In the book -- A horrific woodcut illustration: the fairy
princess, as Roland catches his breath, waking up!--

Almost falls off Maud's couch. He checks a clock. Hears
DROPS OF WATER. He gets up. On Maud's mantelpiece, Roland
is drawn to --

An old photo of a young Edwardian lady. He looks closely at
the picture: a bride clutching a bouquet of flowers. On
the back, an inscription: "M.B. On her wedding day."

Intrigued, Roland hears the DRIPPING sound GROW LOUDER, as -

INT. LIBRARY - RESOURCE CENTER - NIGHT

In the basement, Blanche's diary lies open. Shafts of
moonlight on a deserted hall. A breeze blows, ruffling
pages, past strange drawings of flying doves, as --

Past an aisle of desks, walks a shadowy figure, humming a
childlike song. Along the floor, LEATHER SHOES SQUEAKING, a
soaking wet dress trailing behind her, sound of WATER
DRIPPING...

As this figure vanishes through double doors...
32.
INT. MAUD'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

On her bed, Maud lies asleep on her pillow. A breeze blows.
Maud stirs, something enters the room...

ON MAUD'S FACE

Drops fall like tears. Above her, a pallid hand, delicate
but withered. As Maud's eyes flicker --

At the end of her bed -- bathed in palest lilac light,
Blanche's ghost stares at her, wet clothes DRIPPING PUDDLES
OF WATER.

From her pockets -- Blanche removes stones sewn with thread
into cloth. She snaps each thread, hurling stones up in the
air over Maud, where --

They don't fall, but float in the air. Strange, silvery
spiral shapes upon jet black surfaces --

INT. MAUD'S FLAT - NIGHT

Inside his room, Roland is distracted by strange sounds:
The SNAPPING of THREADS, a SOFT HUMMING, then...

MAUD (0.S.)
No... no... no...
INT. MAUD'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Still half-asleep, Maud tosses her head. Until Blanche
stretches out her hand, strokes her face. Desirous, tender,
filled with grief, Blanche leans over Maud --

INTERCUT -- Roland on the other side of the door -- as --

BLANCHE
My dear princess...

Blanche's bedraggled tresses spill over Maud's face.
Tenderly she lowers her lips in a kiss. But Maud -- awakes
-- a shriek -- the ghost vanishes, and --

Roland rushes in. Maud sits up, sobbing.

ROLAND
What was it -- ?

MAUD
I saw her...

Suddenly, Maud looks up at him --
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:

ROLAND
You...

Maud rushes into the other room, Roland follows --

INT. MAUD'S FLAT - SITTING ROOM - DAWN

Maud by the mantelpiece, next to the framed photo. Roland
enters, puts his hand on her shoulder.

MAUD

I shouldn't have let you stay.
ROLAND

Maud, please --
MAUD

Go back to London. I don't want you

here --
Maud picks up the framed photo, hurls it to the floor.

MAUD
Please --

Roland gives her a final look: no chance but to accept.

ROLAND
If that's what you want.

Maud exits, shuts the door behind her. Roland kneels down
to pick up the mess. Looks at the photograph: initials,
"MB."

EXT. LINCOLN STATION - DAY

Next day. Roland waits on the platform for his train. Maud
waves briefly, hurries away. The train pulls in, stops,
passengers board.

ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
(over loudspeaker)
The train at platform two is the
London Inter-City, now ready for
departure...

Roland looks back, sees Maud getting into her car. A
WHISTLE BLOWS. A moment of decision before the doors lock.
Roland --

Unlocks the door. Gets out --
34.
EXT. LINCOLN STATION - TAXI STAND - DAY

In time to see Maud driving away in her car. Roland hails a
cab, gets in. Sets off, following her --

EXT. LINCOLN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Maud drives out of town into hills. Her car twists 'round
country lanes, drawing Roland onwards. A dark sky glowers,
as --

IN HER CAR

Maud sits staring ahead. Almost trance-like. She drives to
a place she obviously knows well. Roland follows her up to

A remote village amid sweeping hills. At its edge, a
churchyard. Roland loses Maud's car. But as he nears the
church, Roland --

EXT. ST. ETHELREDA CHURCHYARD (LINCOLN) - DAY
Sees her car parked nearby. Roland stops his taxi.

DRIVER
Not much 'round here. Want me to
wait?

Roland checks his pockets. No money.

ROLAND
No, er...
(an embarrassed
silence)
I've done something silly. I don't
have any cash --

The Driver looks at him. Then at his wrist watch.

EXT. ST. ETHELREDA CHURCHYARD (LINCOLN) - DAY

(FEW MOMENTS LATER)

The Driver zooms off -- Roland's watch now strapped to his
wrist. As Roland sets off to search for Maud. He wanders
round the old Norman churchyard. Over in the distance,
stands Maud.

EXT. ST. ETHELREDA CHURCHYARD (LINCOLN) - DAY

A fierce wind blows as Roland hikes up towards her.

(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:

Out on a hill, over a deep, narrow valley, a graveyard.
Maud hears him coming, swivels round as he stands over her.

MAUD
I asked you to leave me alone. How
did you find me?

ROLAND
Sorry. I followed you. I had so
many questions...
(beat)
That girl in the photograph. 'M.B.'
Who was she?

MAUD
May Bailey. Christabel's niece.

ROLAND
Why did you have her picture?

MAUD
Sophie La Motte was Christabel's
sister. She had a daughter called
Maia. Everyone called her May.
(beat)
She was my great-great-grandmother.

ROLAND
So that's why you're so interested
in Christabel. The family
connection.

MAUD
No. Christabel was so unhappy. I
felt she was cursed. I always
avoided her. But her poetry always
drew me back. This is where
Christabel died.

Roland looks at the tombstone. In white stone, a female
saint curves round a humble tomb: Christabel La Motte 1825-
1890.

ROLAND
She died alone?

MAUD
Christabel never married. She had
no children. She spent her last
years living with Sophie and her
husband over at Seal Court.

(CONTINUED)
36.

CONTINUED:
ROLAND
Where is that? Nearby?
MAUD
Not far. You can see it over the

hill.

A gale blows fiercer. Above, BRANCHES RUSTLE and CREAK.
Roland picks up an old bouquet of rusting wire and dead
chrysanthemums.

ROLAND
Can we visit?

MAUD

I'm afraid not. It's not open to
the public. I've never even been
inside. Leonora tried. But she
didn't get on with the owners.

(beat)
The wind is getting up. You should
go now. I'll drive you to the
station. This time I'll make sure
you get on a train.

As wind and rain blow across the saintly figure. Roland
looks back up a hill. Silhouetted on the skyline, Roland
sees glints of silver -- a person in a wheelchair, in
difficulty.

ROLAND
Look. Up there...

To Maud's annoyance, Roland heads off up the hill.

EXT. HILL - DAY

On the hilltop, a wind blows as Roland rushes up. Maud
follows behind. Stuck in mud, a branch has fallen in front
of a lady in a wheelchair: silk scarves, hat and boots:
LADY JOAN.

LADY JOAN
I seem to be stuck. Bogged down.
Foolhardy, my husband says. Most
humiliating. Can you see the
offending object -- ?

ROLAND
(shifting the
branch, slipping)
There. It's out of the way...

(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
Lady Joan lets off the brakes. Maud arrives up the hill.

MAUD
Just as well we were up here. Are
you alright?

LADY JOAN
I feel a bit shaky. My dog is meant
to stay with me. Never does.
Useless great lump. Useless... If
you'd accompany me to the foot of
the track, my husband will get me --

ROLAND
I don't know round here. Which way?

LADY JOAN
Down there. I live at Seal Court.
My name's Bailey... Joan Bailey. I
hope you don't mind. It's not too
far...

Maud looks at Roland, who suppresses an exclamation.

MAUD
We'll take you there.

EXT. SEAL COURT - DAY

Dusk. Rain. Roland and Maud push Lady Joan up a weed-
infested driveway. A tall tower dominates a huge, crumbling
Gothic ruin, covered in roses and vines. Escaping the
storm, they enter --

INT. SEAL COURT - HALL - DAY

A grand decaying hall. Stained glass windows, Pugin-style
carvings, rotting velvet tapestries and RAIN DRIPPING
NOISILY into buckets on stone floors.

LADY JOAN
Better come into the servants' hall.
The only wing we use now. My
husband should be there...

Past a tiger rug on a wide floor, Roland, Maud and Lady Joan
pass through a temple of taxidermy: surrounded by ancient
stuffed animals: bear, lion... wildebeest. Sadly moth-
eaten, dilapidated.

(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:

On wooden panelling, a crest of arms: a crossed shield,
held by unicorn and centaur. Now faded and abandoned,
obviously broke...

INT. SEAL COURT - BAILEY LIVING AREA - DAY

Roland and Maud sit in a kitchen of faded grandeur: piles
of newspapers, pots of jam, old shoes, dog food, broken
toasters...

Her husband, SIR GEORGE, sits with The Sporting Life,
watching TV horse-racing. While Lady Joan serves tea from a
china service, preserving an air of decorum.

LADY JOAN
I suppose we must be related,
Miss Bailey. But the Lincolnshire
Baileys never got on with the
Norfolk Baileys. Family feud.

(beat)
Tea, Mr. Michell? You say you're a
writer...

ROLAND
Not quite. A research assistant.
I'm working on a scholarly edition:
The complete works of Ash, the
Victorian poet --

Roland clears a space on the table. Sir George shouts up
from TV.

SIR GEORGE
Old Tommy Bailey named a horse after
him. Can't think why... Did him at
school once...

LADY JOAN
We had a sort of poet in this
house...

SIR GEORGE

The little lady poet. Terrible
stuff about fairies...

LADY JOAN
Mr. Michell and Miss Bailey might
like poetry --

SIR GEORGE
They can't like Christabel La Motte

(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:

MAUD
I do. We were visiting her grave.

Sir George puts down his paper, glares at Maud.

SIR GEORGE
Who was that frightful nosy American
female ranting about the state of
the grave? You're not in league
with her -- ?

Maud kicks Roland beneath the table. Smiles at Sir George.

MAUD
No... I remember Christabel
described the Seal Court garden in
winter, as she walked there with her
dog...

Maud goes to the window, looks out onto an overgrown garden
with a chipped stone pond at the center.

MAUD'S POV

A ghost of a hound walks across the landscape, then vanishes

BACK TO SCENE

MAUD
... 'the sheltered bench and the
silvery fish in the little pool...
even under the ice, I could see them
suspended. '
(beat)
I've been studying her life.

SIR GEORGE
Not much of a life. She shut
herself away in the East Wing tower.

MAUD
That's what she must have seen.

LADY JOAN
The east wing's never been used. I
came here as a bride in 1929. No
one's touched her room since then.

(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:

Maud looks through the window, a Gothic tower in rain and
wind.

LADY JOAN

We must find the scones. I'm afraid
we don't have too many luxuries
here. But one has to make an
exception --

(to Sir George)
After tea, I think you should show
these young people Christabel's
room. That is, if they want to see.

Roland looks at Maud, whose eyes betray her excitement.

INT. SEAL COURT - EAST WING TOWER - DUSK

Outside, a storm. Up a towering spiral staircase Sir George
leads with an old lantern. Maud and Roland follow with the
Labrador, up CREAKING BOARDS; night sky visible through gaps
in ceiling.

SIR GEORGE
No electricity in this wing. Closed
since the First War...
Roland stumbles, puts his foot through a rotten board.

SIR GEORGE
Careful... Don't want to lose you..

Maud and Roland look up the winding stair: a panelled door

with a latch. Sir George tries pushing it, then pulls it
open. A wind rushes through, as --

INT. SEAL COURT - CHRISTABEL'S ROOM - DUSK

By lantern-light, Roland and Maud see a panelled room with a
box-bed, a mahogany desk carved with goblins, a rocking
horse, heavy trunks and bureau drawers. In a wall beside
the bay-window --

A gaping hole. A pigeon flutters out --

SIR GEORGE
Damn --

Sending the lantern's light across a mirror entwined with
gilded roses.

(CONTINUED)
4l.
CONTINUED:

In its reflection, Maud and Roland see a row of -- staring
tiny white faces propped against an embroidered cushion.

MAUD
The dolls --

On the bed: three dolls with china faces: gold hair, black
hair, and a white nightcap. All stare with blue glassy
eyes.

MAUD
Christabel wrote poems about her
dolls. Here's one...

Maud picks up the cushion: embroidered with verses and
daisy chains. Meanwhile, as Sir George inspects rain damage

ROLAND
I suppose any papers were cleared
from her desk. May we look?

The wind blows out his lantern. The room plunges into
darkness.

SIR GEORGE
-- Not now. Too windy. The boards
are all rotten. Best wait until
morning.

MAUD
Morning...?!

SIR GEORGE
I'm sure Lady Jean will want you to
stay --

MAUD
But that's --

ROLAND
-- very kind of her.

Maud, still holding the cushion, glares at Roland.
SIR GEORGE
Good. Joanie loves having someone
to talk to.
INT. SEAL COURT - KITCHEN - NICHE

Outside, a storm. Ice on the windows.

(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:

Steam from the kettle, as Lady Joan boils up for the hot
water bottles.

LADY JOAN
I think we should get the bed made
up, get some hot water bottles in it
now. Don't you think, Dr. Bailey?

Sir George scurries across with another antique hot water
bottle:

MAUD
You're sure both of us can stay.
This isn't an imposition --

LADY JOAN
Nonsense --

SIR GEORGE
I'll go up and see to the bed. I'll
need help with the sheets --

ROLAND
I'll help.

MAUD
No. I'll go...

Sir George and Maud head upstairs. Lady Joan fills the
kettle. She has taken to Roland, addresses him
affectionately.

LADY JOAN
I hope you haven't had a tiff, or
something.

ROLAND
Tiff?

LADY JOAN

You and your young woman. Girl
friend. Whatever.

ROLAND
Oh no. That is, no tiff, and she
isn't -- my girl friend. I hardly
know her. I've got a girl friend!--

LADY JOAN
(not listening)
She's a beautiful girl, Dr. Bailey.

CONTINUED:

LADY JOAN (CONT'D)
Stand-offish or shy, maybe both.
What my mother called a chilly
mortal.

(beat; holds up a

hot water bottle)
I hope you aren't frozen in that
great draughty room...

EXT. SEAL COURT - NIGHT

Wind, rain. A pristine, magical setting. Trees
fantastically hung with ice, a pond glints in moonlight,
water covering with ice. Frozen gold and silver fish swim
beneath the surface, glowing.

INT. SEAL COURT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the old main bedroom, Roland -- in old jumpers -- makes
up an armchair as a bed. Bitterly cold. As they talk, Maud
gets undressed, behind a screen.

MAUD
You didn't have to stay the night.

ROLAND
Lady Joan wanted us to. They think
we're a couple. Besides, they'll
let us look at Christabel's room
tomorrow.

MAUD
I could have come back on my own.

ROLAND
You're stuck with me now. You'd
never have got in here without me.

MAUD
That doesn't mean I'm grateful.
Turn around...

Roland dutifully snuggles into the armchair, as Maud emerges
from behind the screen in her bedtime outfit: a sugar-pink
winceyette nightdress over long johns, knitted mittens,
Arran sweater.

ROLAND
Then I'll have to tell Sir George
how you and Leonora are such good
friends. I'm sure he'd be very
interested...

(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:

MAUD
You wouldn't do that...

ROLAND
Of course I would. Leonora must
have really offended him.

As Maud gets into her bed, for added protection from the
cold and Roland, she puts on a knitted balaclava. Only her
eyes are visible, peeping out.

MAUD
(getting into bed)
She only complained about the state
of Christabel's grave. But she got
Sir George all upset. It ended with
him firing shots --

ROLAND
Attempted murder. That's handy for
blackmail.

MAUD

I've heard enough from you. I want
to go to sleep.

Maud rolls over, an embroidered cushion next to her head.
Roland lies staring at the ceiling.

ROLAND
You know, in the beginning, they
were very romantic --

MAUD
Who?

ROLAND
Ash and Ellen. He took her to the
south of France for their honeymoon

MAUD
Roland, this is no time for a
lecture --

ROLAND

I always think of them as having a
perfect marriage, no children, just
lives devoted to poetry --

(CONTINUED)
45.

CONTINUED:
MAUD
Just like Christabel --
ROLAND
At least they had something in
common.
MAUD

Good night, Roland.

ROLAND
Good night.

Maud grabs the cushion. Roland switches out the light.
Darkness.

INT. SEAL COURT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

In another far-away bedroom, smothered in blankets and
paraffin stoves, lie Sir George and Lady Joan, fast asleep.
With the Labrador curled up between them.

INT. SEAL COURT - BEDROOM - NIGHT (2:00 AM)

Roland awakes.

ROLAND
Maud...?

Maud is not beside him. Nor is the cushion. The candle has
burnt down. He gets out of bed, lights another.

INT. SEAL COURT - CORRIDORS AND STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Out into corridors, Roland steps with his light.

He walks down a long hallway, reaches the east wing, the
door to the tower.

UP SPIRAL STAIRCASE

Roland walks up, up, up. He reaches the panelled door. He
pauses, pulls the door open, enters to see --

INT. SEAL COURT - CHRISTABEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

By candlelight, WIND still HOWLS in. Roland sees --

the golden-haired doll. He picks it up. And -- as he
stoops down, Roland looks up to see -- Maud. He gasps in

shock --

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
MAUD
Quiet -- !! They might hear us --
ROLAND
-- What are you doing -- ?

Maud points to the embroidered cushion: a poem, sewn in a
childish design around a daisy chain.

MAUD
I couldn't sleep. I think Dolly is
hiding something. Look...
(beat)
'... Dolly keeps a Secret, Safer
than a Friend.
Dolly's Silent Sympathy Lasts
without end.
Friends may betray us, Dolly's
lips are sealed.
Could Dolly tell on us? Much she
concealed...'
(beat)
Give me the knife.

Roland hands her the knife, Maud unpicks a knotted ribbon.
As the ribbons unravel, the silk gown opens up, padding
spills out, and --

MAUD
Something's inside...

Among tufts of duck down -- a package. Wrapped in white
linen with tape like a mummy. Maud unwraps it, and out fall

TWO BUNDLES OF OPEN LETTERS

Maud picks up one pile: in handwriting: "Randolph Henry
Ash Esq., 29 Russell Square, London." Roland picks up the
other, to "Miss Christabel La Motte, Bethany, Mount Ararat
Road, Richmond."

ROLAND
Ash's handwriting. Look at the
dates. He did send it. How did you
know?

MAUD
I didn't.
(beat)
This is Christabel's writing too.
Read yours.

(CONTINUED)
47.

CONTINUED:

Roland picks out a letter, written in Ash's distinctive
handwriting. He can hardly speak --

ROLAND

(reading the

letter)
'... Dear Miss La Motte, Excuse this
letter to a stranger. It was a
great pleasure to talk to you at
dear Crabbe's breakfast party. May
I hope you too enjoyed our talk --
and may I have the pleasure of
calling on you...?!'

(to Maud)

And the answer? Did she answer?

Maud takes a letter, carefully unfolds it.

MAUD

(reading the

letter)
The next day. '... Dear Mr. Ash, I
am a creature of my Pen, my Pen is
the best of me, and I enclose a
Poem, in earnest of my great
goodwill towards you...'

ROLAND
Go on. Please...

Maud holds up the letter. About to read, then --

MAUD

No. It wouldn't be right.
ROLAND

Excuse me?
MAUD

You should read Ash's letters. I'11
read Christabel's.

ROLAND
But why?

MAUD
Those are the poets that interest
each of us --

ROLAND
But they're writing to one
another!--

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

48.

MAUD
That's not the point. How can I be
expected to remember Christabel's
words -- ?

ROLAND
But if they're love letters, don't
you want to hear what he wrote to
her?

MAUD
Roland, please. This is not the
time for your theories --

Maud freezes him with a glance. They settle on the floor,
both take their respective piles. And sit there, opening
letters in silence. Roland opens his, reads a little --
then stares at Maud. Who produces from her pockets a pencil
and some index cards.

ROLAND
What are you doing?

MAUD
I have some cards. I need to record
her observations. It's a system I
use at the center --

ROLAND
This is ridiculous --

MAUD
I have to be methodical. We can
eross-refer later. Just because
you're unprepared --

ROLAND
Unprepared -- ? It's the middle of
the night. I want to get a sense of
what happened to them, how they felt

MAUD
Roland, you're a scholar. There's
no need to get carried away.

Maud goes back to reading. Coldly hostile, she doesn't look
up. Roland picks up his letters, starts reading. Silence.
Their senses are drawn into the words, until --

CONTINUED:

ROLAND (V.0.)

(from the letter)
'... Dear Miss La Motte, You
encourage me more by your permission
to write again, than by your wish
not to be seen. Perhaps you will
tell me about your Fairy Melusina
poem...'

Roland stops reading. He looks across at Maud. Who frowns
with concentration, making neat notes.

ROLAND
Sorry to interrupt...
(as Maud looks up)
Was Christabel still living in
Richmond when she wrote The Fairy
Melusina?

MAUD
Yes.

ROLAND
With Blanche...?
(as Maud nods)
Hmmm...

MAUD
Why do you ask?

ROLAND
Ash seems to have written to
Christabel about her poem. At some
length...

MAUD
Oh...?

ROLAND
Yes. Quite interesting...

Roland lets it drop. But Maud's curiosity is piqued.

MAUD
May I look?

ROLAND
A quick glance.

Maud peers over, sees the reference. Looks up.

MAUD
What did he say?

(CONTINUED)
50.

CONTINUED:
ROLAND
I don't know. I'm just in the
middle...
MAUD

Of course. Maybe you could...

ROLAND
Read it aloud?

MAUD
Just the reference to her poem --

ROLAND
Of course. If you insist...

As Roland starts to read aloud:

FLASHBACK - EXT. BLANCHE AND CHRISTABEL'S HOUSE
(RICHMOND) - DAY (1858)

The postman walking up to their door, carrying the letter
clearly in view. He pops it through the letter box, !as!--

ROLAND (V.0.)
'... Perhaps you will tell me about
your own Fairy Melusina poem...'

From the front window, Christabel watches him go. She --

INT. BLANCHE AND CHRISTABEL'S HOUSE (RICHMOND) - DAY
(1858)

-- runs 'round to the hall, to pick up the letter. She runs
upstairs, unaware of Blanche emerging from downstairs.

ASH (V.0.)
'... By your writing may I come to
know your most secret self, though
my eyes never see your person. When
I write, then I know... Your friend,
Randolph Ash...!

END OF FLASHBACK.
CUT BACK TO:
51.
ROLAND AND MAUD
caught in a spell, in each other's eyes.

ROLAND
How did she reply?

Maud goes for the next letter. Then pauses,

electrified --
MAUD
I can't go on. My hands are
trembling.
ROLAND

Let me find it for you.
(fiddles among
the letters)
It's the next day. They were
writing every day.

Roland selects the right datemark, pulls out the faded
letter, hands it to Maud.

ROLAND
Do you want to read it?

MAUD
Just this one...

Who trembles as she opens it up. She looks up at Roland, as
she reads --

MAUD
'... My dear friend, how shall I
answer? Your inspiration means so
much to me. Yet I feel I cannot
continue our correspondence.
Blanche and I have made a pact,
chosen a way of life. I cannot
choose to break it...'

Roland watches Maud reading, his eyes over her face in the
candlelight. Sensing their deep immersion in this love
story.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

FLASHBACK (BLACK AND WHITE) - EXT. RICHMOND STREETS -
NIGHT

A rainstorm. Up the hill, Christabel and Blanche walk,
followed at a distance by FOOTSTEPS. Outside their house,
Blanche pauses, turns suspiciously. She sees nobody. They
enter their house --

(CONTINUED)
52.

CONTINUED:

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
'... You will say you are no threat
to that. I know the threat is
there. Perhaps it would be better
if we ceased to correspond...'

INT. BLANCHE AND CHRISTABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The WIND HOWLS. A storm blows. From inside, Blanche looks
out from behind shutters. The night of "the Prowler"...

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
'... The world would not look well
upon such letters between a woman
and a married man -- even if that
man were a great and wise poet.
Your friend, Christabel La Motte...'

Down the street, stands a man in black cloak and umbrella,
next to a hansom cab. Windswept, lashed by rain, reveal --
Ash, eyes fixed upon the house. Through trees on the
window: Blanche.

CRASH -- !! The WINDOW SMASHES, SPLINTERS --

ASH (V.0.)
'... I cannot forgive myself.
I have no designs on your freedom.
I know too well the unhappiness a
lack of freedom can bring. This
must be your choice. And yet...'

EXT. RICHMOND HOUSE - DAY
A postman arrives, puts the letter into the letterbox.
ASH (V.0.)
'... Our inspiration is so rare, so

special, I cannot think it better if
we ceased to correspond...!

INT. RICHMOND HOUSE - DAY

THROUGH the letterbox, the postman's letter falls to the
floor. It lies on the hallway, like an evil omen.

(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:

ASH (V.0.)
'... I shall send you the manuscript
of my new poem, with the ink barely
dry, inspired by the thought of
you... Ever yours most truly...'

Christabel picks up the letter, only to reveal -- Blanche
upstairs behind her. She swoops down, snatches the letter,
takes out pages of handwritten poetry. Christabel tries to
retrieve --

A struggle. Blanche throws off Christabel's hand, who
recoils. Blanche takes the poem, holds it up in front of
her --

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
'... I dare not write more. Your
poem is lost. I cannot be sure any
further letter of yours will reach
me...'

Christabel walks upstairs, enters her room, closes the door.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
'... And shall I give up? No, I
will not. If it is possible for you
to walk in Richmond Park at eleven,
I shall be there...!

Out of the window, Christabel sees Blanche leave the house.

BLANCHE'S POV

She looks back up at Christabel, like a princess in the
tower. Blanche clutches the letters in her cloak, hurries
away.

END OF FLASHBACK.

INT. ATTIC - CHRISTABEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Maud looks up at Roland, faces by lantern light, surrounded
by letters. Roland opens up another, hands it to Maud, who
pauses. Gently touches his hand, listening to the WIND
HOWLING --

MAUD
They're here with us now. Aren't
they...

(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:

Roland looks into her eyes. Maud picks up a letter, opens
it. In Christabel's handwriting, the words seem
terrifyingly real:

MAUD
(reading)
'... This is a moment of madness.
You have summoned me out of my tower
-- and out of my wits. I did not
think you would come...!'

The WIND HOWLS, and with a ROLL of THUNDER --

FLASHBACK - EXT. RICHMOND PARK - DAY (1858)

Black clouds. A LIGHTNING STORM ROLLS. Lost in a silver
forest, his horse tethered nearby, Christabel turns towards
Ash. His eyes on hers, her pale face trembling, she holds
out her hand to him.

ASH (V.0.)
'... And then it was my madness.
For in that moment, I could take
your hand... or not. Do the deed,
or turn back forever. I was able to
choose either path...'

Ash reaches out, takes her hand, gloved. Puts it to his
cheek.

ASH (V.0.)
'... And now only the one.'

The moment of contact is too much. Christabel watches as
Ash takes her glove, slowly unpeels it. Lets it lie limply,
then --

Kisses her hand. A moment of perfect stillness. And in
that moment, for the first time, we hear Christabel's voice:

CHRISTABEL
What are we to do?

Ash and Christabel stare into one another's eyes.

ON ASH

ASH (V.0.)
'... There is a fire within us which
must burn...
55.
INT. ASH'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - DAY (1858)

By candlelight inside his study, Ash sits with his books,
composing a letter to Christabel. In the b.g. --

ASH (V.0.)

'... I had a plan to go away to
Yorkshire. There are reservations
for two. I beseech you to accompany
me.

(beat)
I shall wait at noon. St. Agnes's
Church.'

Ellen hovers like a ghost, peering out of the window. She
looks out to raindrops on the windowpane. A servant removes
Ash's bag, Ash kisses Ellen upon the cheek. And heads
downstairs.

EXT. ASH'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - DAY

A driver waits, luggage and gear on a carriage. Ash gives a
letter for Christabel to a messenger. Who races off. The
horses set off, Ash in the back. A CLOCK CHIMES. One, two,
three...

ASH (V.0.)
'... I write in haste. I fear your
answer -- I know not whether to

depart or no...'
Besides Ash's carriage, another black carriage pulls up with
a white crest. Then as Blanche steps out --
INT. ST. AGNES'S CHURCH - DAY (1858)
At the back of the knave, Ash kneels in prayer. He hears
the CLOCK STRIKE TWELVE. Ash turns, sees an outside door
open slowly. Daylight comes into darkness. The candles
flutter as --

MAUD (V.0.)

Did she go with him...?

INT. SEAL COURT - CHRISTABEL'S ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)

Dawn. Maud and Roland lie together, surrounded by the
letters.

ROLAND
There's one left.

(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:

MAUD
You read it...

Roland picks up a final letter. From Christabel's pile. He
reads it in silence, intrigued by its contents.

ROLAND
It's from Christabel. She asks Ash
to return all her letters --

MAUD
Is there any more? There must be...

Frustrated, Maud rummages among the letters. Suddenly, a
door opens, Maud and Roland looks up to see --

Sir George staring at them.

SIR GEORGE
What in hell's name -- ?

On the floor, letters are fanned out. Dolls lie, ribbons
untied, dresses unravelled. Maud and Roland look up at Sir
George.

ROLAND
Sir... we found letters from Ash and
Christabel --

MAUD

This could change everything --
Sir George points his hunting gun at them.

SIR GEORGE
Hands up --

EXT./INT. SEAL COURT - HALL/LIVING AREA - DAY (LATER)

Roland stands outside, whistling. Waiting for the taxi.
Inside -- Maud descends the staircase, sees Sir George in
the hall on the telephone. Maud enters --

KITCHEN

where the letters lie on a mound of yellowing newspapers.
Lady Joan greets her sympathetically.

MAUD
Once it's known these letters exist,
everyone will be at your door.
Everyone.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:

LADY JOAN
Oh, dear... Sir George has a fizzing
temper. I'm sorry you have to go.

From outside, the taxi BEEPS its HORN. Roland waves to
Maud.

MAUD
So am I.

EXT. ST. ETHELREDA'S CHURCH - DAY

VOOM, VOOM -- ! Maud REVS up her CAR outside the church
where they left it. She pulls out past the taxi which
dropped them. Beside her, Roland looks downcast.

ROLAND
They must be worth a fortune.

MAUD
We both had the same instinct. To
play them down. Cropper would love
to get his hands on them. Do you
think we should tell him -- ?

ROLAND
No -- they'd be in New Mexico
tomorrow. He's have to sit on them.
Or his whole theory about Ash would
be blown away --

MAUD
Sir George would be a lot richer.
He could mend that house --

ROLAND
I don't know why I feel so
possessive about the damned things.
They're not mine.

MAUD
We found them. And they're private.
They're love letters. I'll bet Sir
George will sell them...

A moment passes. Roland is agitated. He turns to Maud.
ROLAND
We should make a pact. If one of us
finds out any more, he or she tells
the other, and no one else.

(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
Maud comes to a crossroads. Left to Lincoln, right to the

North. She pauses. Then revs up, sets off. Roland expects
to turn left -- to Lincoln. She turns right.

ROLAND

You went the wrong way.
MAUD

We're not going back to Lincoln.
ROLAND

Where are we heading?
MAUD

Whitby...

(beat)

We have to find out. Did Christabel
go there with Ash?

Maud stares at Roland. HOLD ON his expression. As the b.g.
whizzes past --

EXTREME CLOSEUP

An intense sound of WHEELS POUNDING a CLICKETY-CLACK rhythm
-- a relentless HISS of STEAM and ROARING FIRE, that bursts
into a PIERCING WHISTLE -- that tears through time, as --

SMASH CUT TO:

FLASHBACK - INT. TRAIN - RAILWAY CARRIAGE (YORKSHIRE) -
DAY (1859)

Black smoke billows in a hellish cloud, as an iron
juggernaut zooms on, landscape zips past a window at
breakneck speed, as -- in DAZZLING VIVID COLOR --

ASH

looks out of a window, with a patch of warm breath. A
gloved hand wipes through the haze to reveal, in the
reflection, Christabel's face in bright sunlight. Both
nervous, they sit opposite one another. Both with books
upon their knees, Ash suddenly looks up. He has been
planning his speech --

ASH
Forgive this boldness. What I do
not know is... whether you wish to
travel as my wife. It is a large
step --
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:

CHRISTABEL
I want to be with you. I am quite
happy to be called your wife. That
is what I had understood I -- we --
had decided.

ASH
You must not regret this.

CHRISTABEL
Of course I shall regret. So will
you, will you not? But that is of
no importance at this time.

Silence. Then from his pocket, a box: inside, a gold
signet ring.

ASH
I hope you will accept this ring.

CHRISTABEL
My resolution was as strong as
yours.

She produces her own ring, jade with initial "C." They
smile. Ash peels off her glove. He pushes his ring over
hers.

CHRISTABEL
So... it is done.

Ash holds onto her hand. Suddenly with a WHOOSH of smoke
the TRAIN plunges into flickering darkness of a tunnel. Ash
presses her hand to his lips. Shards of sunlight flicker
like a kinematoscope on his face, Ash lets her fingers fall.
Then -- into light again -- Ash turns her leather glove in
his hands, smoothing its soft leather pockets back into
shape like a fetish. Staring at her.

EXT./INT. WHITBY HOTEL - DUSK (1859)

Late sun. A white hotel, perched on a cliff looking out to
sea. As if in a vivid dream -- Ash and Christabel dismount
from a horse-drawn carriage. The hotelier MRS. CAMMISH
organizes the baggage: hatboxes, trunks, collecting boxes,
nets, writing desks. Which are carried upstairs, as -- Ash
and Christabel go to a window. A view over cliffs, of grey
sea.

ASH
There. The German sea. Like steel,
with life in it.

(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:

CHRISTABEL
It reminds me of the Breton coast.
Which is in some sense my home.
It's so changeable. Blue and clear
one day, the next dark and wild.

ASH
(awkwardly)
I -- we -- must go there too. There

are so many places. Even around
here. Such curious northern names.
Ugglebarnby. Jugger Howe. Howl

Moor --

CHRISTABEL
On the map, I saw one. The Boggle
Hole.

She starts to laugh. Ash smiles too.

ASH
The Boggle Hole...
(laughs too)
Do you like the sound of that? Then
we shall go there.

Ash says it agreeably. Christabel relaxes a little.

CHRISTABEL
I should like that. Very much.

Outside, a wind blows in from the sea, as --

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. WHITBY HOTEL, DINING ROOM - DUSK

outside a picture window, a tall TREE RUSTLES in the wind.
In a large Victorian room now with modern furniture --

Maud and Roland at a table, busy with piles of books and
notes. Map open beside Cropper's biography of Ash, Roland
jots down names... Boggle Hole.

ROLAND
There's a place on the map, the
Boggle Hole. That's a nice word.
Maybe we could go --

ROLAND (CONT'D)
(off Maud deep
in her book)
Found anything?

MAUD
(looking up)
I've been reading Ash's love poems.
Most love poetry is only talking to
itself. But Ash wasn't. I think he
was talking to her.

ROLAND
To Ellen --
MAUD
No, Christabel.
(beat)
I like them now.
ROLAND
I'm glad you like something about
him.
MAUD

I didn't say I didn't like Ash. I
only thought Christabel wouldn't
like him. I've been trying to
imagine him. Them.

ROLAND
They must have been in an extreme
state. A moment of madness brought
them here, threw their lives up in
the air. Just like us!--

MAUD
They were in love.

ROLAND
Of course. Don't you envy them?

MAUD
I don't know. We never say the word
love, do we. It's always sex. We
see it everywhere. We say we're
driven by desire, but we can't see
it as they did.

(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:

ROLAND
Sometimes I feel that the best state
is to be without desire. I have
this image of a clean empty bed in a
clean empty room, where nothing is
asked or to be asked --

MAUD
That's what I think about too, when
I'm alone. The same image. An
empty bed in an empty room. AI1l
white.

ROLAND
Exactly the same.

Outside, a gust of WIND RUSTLES LEAVES. Mrs. Cammish enters
with a tray, Maud presses her napkin to her lips, dabs her
mouth.

MAUD
How strange.

Instinctively, Maud stares down at her napkin. In that
moment --

CLOSEUP
ON the imprint of her lipstick --
CUT TO:

FLASHBACK - INT. WHITBY HOTEL - DINING ROOM - DUSK

Christabel lowers her napkin politely, stares back at Ash
seated opposite. As a 19th Century Mrs. Cammish fusses at
the table. Now a private dining suite, decorated in
Victorian damask finery.

MRS. CAMMISH
Your lady wife is looking a bit
peaky, sir. Not eating her food?

ASH
Soup. Boiled hake and potatoes.
Cutlets and peas. Arrowroot molds
and treacle tart. We have dined
well, Mrs. Cammish.

63.
CONTINUED:

MRS. CAMMISH
A spot of sea air. That's the tonic
for your wife, sir. I can tell,
she's a chilly mortal --

Mrs. Cammish breezily removes her tray, exits. Christabel
smiles politely, as Ash takes out a thin cigarillo from a
silver case.

ASH
Mrs. Cammish is right. You must
enjoy the sea air.

CHRISTABEL
Perhaps it is considered a wifely
pursuit. I think Mrs. Cammish
considers me lacking in wifely
virtues.

Ash lights the cigarillo, takes a lung-full of smoke.

ASH
I care not for such wifely virtue.
(beat)
Will you go up first, my dear?

Christabel stands up, strained but mocking. She smiles.

CHRISTABEL
If you wish, my dear...

Christabel takes a lit candle, exits. Ash walks to the
window. Enjoys his cigar smoke curling in front of him, the
CRASH of the SEA below, as Mrs. Cammish reappears.

ASH
Do you have a cognac?

MRS. CAMMISH
Nothing French in this house, sir.

ASH
Quite so.
(to himself, beneath
his breath)
“Le degout, c'est voir juste. Apres
la possession, l'amour voit juste

MRS. CAMMISH
No cognac, and no Balzac, neither,
sir.

Good night, Mrs. Cammish.

Mrs. Cammish exits. Ash blows a last puff of cigar smoke,
then --

INT. WHITBY HOTEL - HALLWAY AND STAIRS - NIGHT (1859)

Ash walks down a dark hall, past towering plants, elaborate
mosaics, to the stairs. Maids dutifully wax wood, shine
brass.

. ASH (V.0.)
Dear Ellen... Today I made a
curious geological discovery..

Ash mounts stairs, footsteps muffled by carpet. He nears
the top, on his face -- dread and wonder. Ash walks down
the corridor.

ASH (V.0.)

Adornments may be made here
from ancient ammoniate fossils,
creatures long dead but not
vanished. They are jet black, with
a special silver lustre. In this
very marvel of science, I now see a
perfect miracle...'

Two chambermaids walk past Ash, curtseying. Ash stubs out
his cigarillo on a brass ashtray. He stands in front of the
room, then opens the door --

INT. WHITBY HOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT (1859)

Ash enters a dark, candle-lit room. On a chair sits a --
Crinoline petticoat like a collapsed cage, all steel hoops
and straps. To one side, a brass bed: Where Christabel

stands, her back to him, arms on the rails, in a corset.

CHRISTABEL
I need some assistance.

Ash moves over to her. His fingers pick up fine, long
laces; unthreads, trembling over boned silk; he fumbles,
drops them.

(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:

ASH
I am inexperienced in such matters.

Christabel does not look back. She pulls her hair up to
reveal the nape of her neck, downy hair by candlelight. Ash
sees the swell of her breasts, as he plants...

A kiss upon her bare shoulder. And with a whisper --

ASH
You are safe with me.

CHRISTABEL
I am not at all safe with you.
(beat)
But I have no desire to be
elsewhere.

Ash unthreads the laces. He feels the curve of her waist,
her hips. Slowly, as she turns to undo his collar stud, she
kisses him on his neck. As ina...

MONTAGE

of buttons and laces -- stockings unrolled -- corset removed
-- candle blown out --

UPON BED

Ash embraces her.

CHRISTABEL
Are you afraid?

ASH
Not now... my white lady,

Christabel.
Ash takes her in his arms. They lie upon the bed.

ASH
Do not fight me...

CHRISTABEL
I must...

A pool of light from a bedside lamp, as Roland murmurs a
poem aloud from a book of Ash's poetry.

ROLAND
... Or the thundering roar
Of the Ash volcanic,
Thrown from some crater
Of earth-fire within?'

Roland walks over to the bathroom. A heavy, latched door.
He knocks, no reply. Then opens the door --
INT. WHITBY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

The door swings in -- IN SLOW MOTION. Steam gathers in cold
air. Roland nearly falls over a part-naked figure!--

Maud in a silken robe, who steadies herself on his shoulder

Roland throws up a hand, clasps her supple body beneath her

robe -- Maud gasps. An electric current between
them --
ROLAND
I knocked -- I'm sorry...

Roland briefly clutches the silk. He lets it go, as if
stung. He sees her hair -- damp, over bare shoulders and
neck. Beads of water, running down to her breasts.

MAUD
(composing herself)
I waited some time for you to use
the bathroom.

ROLAND
So did I. I was looking for a light

MAUD
Well...

ROLAND
If we don't find anything, I'm sorry

it was my fault.

MAUD
It's okay. I don't blame you.

ROLAND
I wanted us to find something,
together. I really did. And if we
reach a dead end, then...

MAUD
I wanted this to happen too. We'll
think of something.

Good night.

Maud exits, closing the door. Leaving Roland in the foggy
steam, looking at himself in the mirror -- in which he sees
a blurred figure. He wipes away the steam to see a swirl of
white sheets --

In darkness, Ash awakes. Not beside him. He sees her over
by a windowseat. In a swirl of sheets, he gets up, goes
over. Finds her shaking silently, with tears. He puts out
an arm.

ASH
What is it, my dear?

CHRISTABEL
How can we bear it? For so short a
time. How can we sleep this time
away?

ASH
We can pretend that we have all the
time in the world.

CHRISTABEL
And every day we shall have less.
And then none.

ASH
Would you rather have had nothing at
all?

CHRISTABEL
No. We are here, we are now. Let
me hold you...

(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:

Christabel caresses Ash. He kisses her neck, her breast.

CHRISTABEL
You will burn me up.
ASH
Then let us burn until we are both

consumed...

Ash kisses her. Draws his hand down her body to her breast

ASH
Now I know you, truly.

CHRISTABEL
Yes, I admit. You know me...

Through the open window, a wind blows, ruffling her hair. A
breeze floating through the room, as --

INT. WHITBY HOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

A breeze wafts through, ruffling her hair, awakening Maud
from her dream to hear Christabel's voice... half-dream,
half-real.

CHRISTABEL (0.8.)
Admit. You know me...

In pale dawn light, Maud sees letters scattered over her
table. Then over by the windowseat --

Christabel sits looking out, head turned away, hair blowing
in the breeze... through the window: sea spray crash on
rocks: the water resembles flames of fire.

Framed in the window with the ghost, the reflection of the
leaping flames against her face, Maud gets an epiphany --

MAUD
Oh my God... Roland.
INT. WHITBY HOTEL - ROLAND'S BEDROOM - DAWN

Roland awakes to KNOCKING at his door. Groggily he gets up,
goes to the door. Opens it to see -- Maud.

(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:

MAUD
My room. Now.

Maud returns swiftly. Roland steps out warily, wondering.

INT. WHITBY HOTEL - MAUD'S BEDROOM - DAWN

Roland walks into Maud's room. Sees her staring out of the
window. For a moment, he can't see anything. He looks
closer at the window.

MAUD
I saw her.

ROLAND
Who...?

MAUD
Christabel.

Maud moves closer to Roland. Almost touching. As Roland
sees traces of a reflection in the window. He turns to her.

MAUD
All my life, since I was a child,
I've seen her. But never with
anyone else. You saw her, didn't
you...?

ROLAND
I'm not sure what I saw...

MAUD
I saw Blanche that night in Lincoln.
That's why I wanted you to go. I
thought it was a warning.

ROLAND
And now?
MAUD
I don't know. You don't think I'm
crazy --
ROLAND
No, never. Not much, anyway.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
ROLAND (CONT'D)
But two crazy people are no more use
than one. We still have no proof.

Now the ghost has vanished, Maud can see out over the beach.

MAUD
Look. Out there.

Roland squints his eyes. Focuses out in the distance:
waves crash upon rocky caverns, sun scattering light like
flames.

MAUD
You read Christabel's poem about
Melusina --

ROLAND

But I never finished it.
Maud moves closer to the window, entranced by what she sees.

MAUD
‘And where the water moved and
shook itself
A show of leaping flames, of
tongues of light --

Roland moves towards her. An idea.

ROLAND
Wait. Say it again. Do it, and
I'll recite a line from Ash.
(as Maud protests)
Just do it --

Now inspired, Roland starts. Suspicious, Maud carries on.

ROLAND MAUD
'Shall our hearth's ash '... And where the water
grow pale or spark in moved and shook
waves--' itself!--'

FROM Roland's face, PAN ONTO Maud.

ROLAND/MAUD
(together)
'-- A show of leaping flames, of
tongues of light,
A fountain of cold fire, self
renewed.'
(CONTINUED)
71.

CONTINUED:

Both amazed, as the words coincide.

ROLAND

The same lines. Word for word.
MAUD

They were here. They saw it...

 

together.

They look out to sea. In the window reflection, flames
dance off waves as they crash against rocky caverns. Roland
and Maud's faces together in the window.

INT. ASH FACTORY - BASEMENT - DAY

Inside his office, Blackadder is hard at work on a footnote

of an Ash poem (Mummy Possesst). He looks up to see:
Fergus. Instinctively, Blackadder puts a hand over his

writing.

FERGUS
I was looking for Roland Michell.

BLACKADDER
He's on holiday. He asked for a few
days off... Never had a holiday
before, now that I think of it --

FERGUS

Maybe this was personal. I was
pretty sure Roland was onto
something about Christabel La
Motte...

(as Blackadder

raises an eyebrow)
But it may have come to nothing. Or
he'd have told you.

BLACKADDER
He probably would.

FERGUS
Exactly.
INT. ROLAND AND VAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Val is eating cornflakes. CATS MEOWING. The DOORBELL
RINGS. She goes to answer it. It's Fergus Wolf.

FERGUS
Hello, my dearest. Is Roland in?

(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:

VAL
No. He's gone away for a few days.

FERGUS
What a pity. I need to get in touch
with him rather urgently.

VAL
He hasn't phoned. I don't know when
he's back. I haven't been all that
nice to him.

FERGUS
I see...

VAL
I don't know what you see, Fergus.
You always see a bit more than there
is to see. What's up?

FERGUS
There's something going on I don't
understand. Yet. You don't happen
to know Maud Bailey?

A silence. Now Val is intrigued.

VAL
I see... He didn't tell me what he
was up to. He knows I'm not
interested. But I did have a phone
number. For emergencies.

FERGUS
This could be an emergency.

EXT. SOHO STREETS (OUTSIDE L'ESCARGOT) - DAY

Outside a restaurant, Mortimer Cropper walks with Hildebrand
Ash down the street. When he hears a voice behind him.

FERGUS
Professor Cropper --
(as Cropper and
Hildebrand turn
'round)
Sorry to interrupt. I was curious
if you'd seen Roland Michell
recently...
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:

FERGUS (CONT'D)
(beat; catches his
breath)
I think he may have discovered
something. A connection between Ash
and the poet Christabel La Motte...

Hildebrand and Cropper exchange glances.

CROPPER
How extraordinary. We were just
discussing an enquiry about some
letters up in Lincoln --
(giving his full
attention)
You interest me, Dr. Wolf.

Like a cat with the cream, Fergus purrs quietly.

INT. SEAL COURT - DAY

THROUGH the kitchen window, Sir George peers out from behind
the curtain to see a swanky Mercedes arrive outside the
house. He goes into the hallway, picks up his shotgun,
and!--

EXT. SEAL COURT - DAY

Sir George aims his shotgun down its sights at Mortimer
Cropper, standing by his Mercedes looking up at the house.

SIR GEORGE
Who the hell are you?

Cropper walks forward, holding out his card.
CROPPER
Professor Mortimer Cropper of the
Cropper Foundation, Harmony City,
New Mexico. I've come a long way!--
Sir George doesn't take the card. Still aims the gun.

SIR GEORGE
Go away. What do you want!-- ?

(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:

CROPPER
Don't shoot. I never trouble the
truly reluctant. I believe you may
be in possession of letters by
Randolph Henry Ash. Have you any
idea of how much they would be
worth?

SIR GEORGE
Worth?

CROPPER
In money. In money, Sir George.

Sir George's brow creases with thought. The gun lowers.

SIR GEORGE
English things should stay in
England in my view!--

CROPPER
Understandable. An admirable
sentiment. But these days, how
relevant is sentiment?

Cropper sees the gap, leaps in. He proffers Sir George his
card.

EXT. WHITBY SEASHORE - NEAR CAVERN - DAY

Roland and Maud at a rocky cavern they glimpsed from the
hotel. Maud with scarf covering her hair, suddenly seeing
Roland in a new light, as she examines the distinctive,
jet-black stones.

MAUD
Look at these. All shiny and black.
No wonder Ash wrote about them.

ROLAND
I wonder if they ever met again...

MAUD
No one knows where Christabel went
when Blanche died. She seems to
have vanished --

ROLAND
Then it's hopeless. We still need
to find real proof Ash and
Christabel were here together.

(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:

MAUD
That could take weeks...
(beat)
Will you be sorry to go back now?

ROLAND
Will you?

MAUD
I have the impression both of us
will be sorry.

Maud looks up at Roland. And as the sunlight reflects on
the stones in her hand --

DISSOLVE TO:

FLASHBACK - EXT. WHITBY SEASHORE (ROCKY CAVERN) - DAY
(1859)

Stones in the hand of Christabel, glinting. Ash and
Christabel are in a cavern aglow with light. Outside, WAVES
CRASH against rocks, as Christabel fills her basket with
jet-black stones. In a playful, light-hearted mood, Ash
nuzzles close to her.

CHRISTABEL
I shall take these home, use them to
prop doors, weigh down the sheets of
my poem!--

Affectionately, hands intertwined, she teases him.

ASH
Let me carry them back for you.

CHRISTABEL
(laughingly)
I can carry my own burdens.

ASH
Not while I am here!--

Ash takes the basket. She relents, then suddenly her mood
shifts. She looks away saddened, as they head out onto the
rocks.

CHRISTABEL
You know that after these few days
together! --

ASH

Let us not think of time!--

(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:

CHRISTABEL
We must part, never look back. It
is inevitable, we both know it!--

ASH
I cannot, will not. I love you!--

CHRISTABEL
You speak to me of love? You have a
wife, sir. Speak to me of her.

In sudden fury, the SEA CRASHES against rocks below. Wind
buffets them. In anguish, words stick in his throat, tears
in his eyes.

ASH

I have a wife... and I love her.
Not as I love you...

(he stops; unable

to go on)
There are good reasons why my love
for you need not hurt her. I know
this must sound bald and lame. It
must be what many men, philandering
men, have said before me. I never
thought to find myself saying such
things. Yet I believe what I have
said to be true. I can never tire
of you!-- of this!--

CHRISTABEL
It is in our nature to tire.
Fortunately. Let us collude with
necessity. Let us play with it...
(beat)

'... And if we cannot make our sun
stand still, yet we will make him
run.'

ASH
A poet after my own heart.

CHRISTABEL
And mine. Though not more beloved
than Randolph Henry Ash...

She moves towards him. They embrace passionately. From her
pocket, Christabel throws a paper out on the wind, flying
away !--

ASH
What is that?

(CONTINUED)
77.

CONTINUED:
CHRISTABEL
A poem. I was writing it here.
ASH
Why!-- ? You... are not happy with
it?
CHRISTABEL
These feelings!-- I want them to

live forever. To survive the few
days we have here.

She trembles, close to tears. Ash takes her in his arms.
And as the wild sea buffets the shore, WAVES CRASHING
against rocks!--

HOLD ON the scraps of paper, as they fly on the wind, PAST
the tide pools, ACROSS the beach, TOWARDS the seashore,
where! --

They scatter across two pairs of feet. One in chic modern
sandals, the other wearing old tennis shoes. REVEAL!--

END OF FLASHBACK.

EXT. WHITBY SHORELINE - DAY

Roland and Maud on the shore. Reluctantly, getting ready to
go.

ROLAND
I don't know what will happen to me
when I get back. I've got no real
job. And then there's Val... I've
lived with her since university. I
owe her so much. But it doesn't
work. Not for any good reason. But
because...

MAUD

I had a relationship like that. We
tormented each other. One of those
people who as soon as you open your
mouth, they say another cleverer,
louder thing. Quoting Freud at six
in the morning. I felt battered.
For no good reason.

Roland sees Maud smiling. Fiddling with her head scarf.

(CONTINUED)
78.

CONTINUED:
ROLAND
Tell me!-- Why do you always cover
your hair?
MAUD

It's the wrong color. No one
believes it's natural. Ata
conference once I got accused of
trying to please men. So I cut it
off. Now it's grown, I put it away.

ROLAND
You shouldn't. You should let it
out.

MAUD

Why do you say that?

ROLAND
Because if anyone can't see it, they
think and think about it, they
wonder what it's like...

MAUD
Do they?
ROLAND
Yes... Life is so short. It has a

right to breathe.

Suddenly, Maud unties her head-square, undoes the clips
slowly.

MAUD
You are an odd man.

ROLAND
I'm not making a pass. You know
that.

MAUD
Yes, I do. That's what's so odd.

She puts down her head, shakes it.

ROLAND
That feels better.

MAUD
All right. That feels better.

A moment between them. Roland is drawn towards her. But
up to the cliff, Maud sees a familiar figure appear, waving
at them.

(CONTINUED)
79.

CONTINUED:
CROPPER
Hello, down there!-- !
Roland and Maud swivel 'round to see!-- the urbane

silhouette of Mortimer Cropper, walking towards them in the
sandy cove.

CROPPER
At last. You're a hard pair to
track down!--

ROLAND
How did you find us!-- ?

CROPPER
A little detective work. You're
forgetting. I know our dear
Randolph better than any of you.
Congratulations on your discovery...
(beat)
Tea, anyone...?

Cropper moves up to them, with his shark's grin.

INT. HOTEL - TEA ROOM - DAY

Cropper pours tea for Maud, Roland looks on. Cropper is
charmingly proprietorial, gleeful at his new possessions.

MAUD
At least Sir George and Lady Joan
will get some money --

ROLAND
But have you read the letters?

CROPPER

That's not so important. I'll be
sending them back to New Mexico for
safekeeping. Poor Lord Ash found
the news very upsetting. He had a
stroke --

(as Roland and

Maud react)
Hildebrand has stepped in to look
after the Ash estate.

ROLAND
We can't prove it yet. But we think
Ash and Christabel came here.
Together! --

(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:

CROPPER

Fascinating...

(beat; a grin)
Perhaps. Perhaps not... Of course,
if something did develop between Ash
and Christabel, Maud and I would be
the natural team to do the research.
After all...

(puts a proprietorial

arm around her)
We have a 'special relationship’...

Roland picks up the nuance. Cropper turns to him.

CROPPER
We already fund Maud's work. And
with what I know about Ash... I
don't think you'll be needed, Dr.
Michell.

Roland sits, saying nothing. Furious.

CROPPER
Thanks for your time and energy, Dr.
Michell. I'm sure you understand.

ROLAND
I understand.

Roland looks at Maud, like a rabbit in the headlights. Says
nothing. Roland gets up, walks off in disgust. Cropper
stops Maud following. She turns to him.

MAUD
Now you own the letters you can do
what you want -- why do you need me?
CROPPER

My lawyer tells me Ash wrote a note
returning his letters to
Christabel's possession. A legal
technicality --

MAUD
You mean the letters could belong to
me?

CROPPER
Open to dispute. But I'd hate to
see you waste money on law suits.
So unnecessary.

(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
Maud pulls her hand away from Cropper.

MAUD
I was worried you were being nice to
me. How silly...

INT. ROLAND'S ROOM/CORRIDOR - DAY
Maud follows Roland up to his room. She knocks on his door.

MAUD
Roland, let me in --

ROLAND (0.S.)
Go away --

Maud tries the door. To her surprise, it's unlocked. She
enters. Finds Roland flinging his books and papers into a
bag.

MAUD
Look at me, Roland --

ROLAND
I can hear you fine --

MAUD
I can't back out of this. The
center. The students. That's my

life --
ROLAND

Good. You're welcome to it --
MAUD

I -- we -- need Cropper's money.
ROLAND

He wants to own everything. Now he
does. Including you --

MAUD
So what can we do? If we had any
firm proof about Ash and Christabel

ROLAND
We could have carried on -- I can't
believe you expect me to listen to
Cropper's bullshit -- when, on top
of everything else -- you slept with
this... this
cowboy --

(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:

Roland finishes his packing, heads for the door.

MAUD
Roland, you're jealous. It's
nothing --

ROLAND

Nothing?! You're kidding -- one day
I'm on the academic scoop of the
decade -- the next this necrophiliac
ex-boyfriend of yours tells me I'm
unemployed --

MAUD
You don't even have a job --

ROLAND
I don't even have a life. I wash
dishes --

MAUD
I thought that was a story -- some
wimpish puppy dog trick for sympathy

ROLAND
I don't need to invent things. I
live in a stinking basement, full of
cat piss --

MAUD
Then you're pathetic, Roland. Go
back to your basement, with your
books and your dreams and your
stupid romantic illusions -- because
you don't live in the real world --

ROLAND
I'm glad. I hate the real world.
As a concept, it's much overrated.

Maud tries to calm it down. Roland heads out the door.

MAUD
Okay... okay... Listen -- I'll see
what I can do. I'll go to London.
Stay at Leonora's. Maybe I can
persuade Cropper --

ROLAND
Don't bother. I thought we wanted
the same thing. Obviously, we
don't.

(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:

Roland takes his bag, pushes past her. Exits down the
corridor. Maud watches him disappear. Behind her, Cropper

CROPPER
Not your type, Maud. Too weak.
Leonora and I would both be
devastated.

The sound of a TRAIN, WHISTLING through a tunnel, as --

INT. TRAIN (LONDON) - DAY

Drifting off, Roland sits in his carriage as the train zips
through the rolling countryside. In the newspaper, an
article:

"Ash Letters Rock Literary World" with a picture of...
Cropper. The light plays on his face, flickering like a
kinematoscope --

As a WHISTLE SHRIEKS and carries over TO --

FLASHBACK - INT. STATION/TRAIN (LONDON) - DAY (1859)

Amid the steam of a train on its platform, Ash and
Christabel disembark. His luggage sits awaiting him with
porters.

He takes Christabel to a carriage, loaded with her cases.
Ash helps her up. Holds onto her hand, as she sits down.

CHRISTABEL
I must go.

ASH
If only...

He kisses her hand. Christabel gives a rueful smile.

CHRISTABEL
I am sad we went walking, sir.
(beat)
Yet sad too, that we are not walking

still.
She does not withdraw her hand. Ash lets it go. The
coachman shuts the door. They stare into each other's eyes,
as the driver cracks his whip and her carriage sets off --

Ash stares at the carriage. His eyes moist with tears. As
Christabel vanishes into the distance.

END OF FLASHBACK.
84.
INT. ROLAND'S FLAT - DAY

Weary and exhausted, finally home, Roland passes his
bicycle, makes his way down his flat. In the corridor,
Roland finds Val. With her coat on. A suitcase. And vase,
in hand.

VAL
Hello, Roland. Did you have a good
time with Maud Bailey?

ROLAND
I rang and rang you ...

VAL
I thought if you could vanish, I
could. So I did.

ROLAND
You don't look very angry, Val.
Actually, you look happy.

Roland looks 'round the flat. Furniture seems to be
missing.

VAL
I decided I could be...
(beat)
I'm going to live with Euan.

The shock, when it comes, is a double whammy: he has no
idea.

ROLAND
Who?
VAL
A lawyer. In my office. Anything
to say?
ROLAND
Er... I'm glad.
VAL
I hope not altogether glad. Are you
all right?
ROLAND
In some ways. In others, I'm ina
mess.
VAL

You'll survive, I suppose. The
rent's paid until the first of the
month. This week, that is.

VAL (CONT'D)
I'll leave you the cats... Dry food.
And sardines. No tins. And change
the tray. Daily... if you can
possibly manage.

Roland stands in the hallway, Val picks up her suitcase,
exits. The door slams. Welcome home.

INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

Inside a studio, a TV panel gets ready to debate the hot
literary news. LEONORA STERN, a loud, energetic US feminist
sits next to Blackadder, in the makeup chair, while Cropper
and Hildebrand Ash sit under lights getting ready.

MAKEUP

Ready, Professor Stern -- ?
LEONORA

More blush, deary, I can take

it --

As an interviewer announces a lead-in, Leonora leans over,
whispering to Blackadder, hand poised on his thigh.

LEONORA
You've got to make your Mr. Ash to
be the hottest property in town,
Professor. Get them by the balls.
Give them one sexy thing, you'll do
fine!--

BLACKADDER
One sexy thing. Mmnnn...

LEONORA

I love the way you talk. By the
way...

(hand on his thigh)
I take it neither of us want Cropper
to win this. You may be interested,
Professor. I got a letter from a
research student in Brittany...

Alone in his apartment!-- Roland glowering at the TV screen.
A low moan. The cats keep out of his way.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. LEONORA'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Watching the same TV program, like two lonely hearts, Maud
sits on the sofa in Leonora's. She uncovers a letter on a
table. <A French address catches her eye. She reads it
avidly.

MAUD

I am currently working on an
unpublished writer, Sabine de
Kercoz, and have discovered material
I believe will be of interest to

Maud flicks through Leonora's files. Finds an address. She
hesitates.

INTERCUT between --

‘ Roland...? Are you there...?
Roland, I need to speak to you... I
know you don't want to speak to
me... But I think I've found another
clue...

BACK TO TV
as each of the panel competes for 15 seconds of fame.

LEONORA (V.0.)
‘ Of course, from a radical
feminist perspective, it was a
surprise to learn Christabel might
have loved a man!--

BLACKADDER (V.0.)
A complete shock. It's as if we'd
discovered Shakespeare's Dark Lady!-

CROPPER (V.0.)
I don't think we have to rush to
conclusions. Nothing happened. To
my eyes, this correspondence was a
purely literary love affair. Ash
was always a complex man. This only
proves his moral stance as
exemplary. Until Dr. Fergus Wolf
and I examine the evidence! --

BLACKADDER (V.0.)
That's why the letters must stay in
our country as part of our
heritage!--

PATEL (V.0.)

With your father now ill, doesn't

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. ASH HOUSE MUSEUM - LIBRARY - DAY

Up in the old Ash house, now a museum, shelves are filled
with books, papers, portraits. Glass cases of specimens.
Amid a huge box-file, Beatrice takes shelter. On the phone

BEATRICE
... Yes. Are you alright? I'm over
at the Ash Museum -- Blackadder's
been in a fearful rage. Says you've
been doing things behind his back --

ROLAND
Right now I hate Blackadder -- I
hate Ash -- I hate the whole Ash
factory --

BEATRICE
He's screaming for a copy of Mrs.
Lees's book, with a description of
the Ash seance --

ROLAND
The seance? Why?

BEATRICE
Cropper's onto something. He's
checking up on Ash's whereabouts in
1860. He's desperate. My filing
system is his last hope. I can't
find a copy anywhere. Maybe you
could help --

ROLAND
Hmm... I don't know... It's called
The Shadowy Portal, isn't it?

Roland looks distractedly at his piles of books. Around the
apartment, books on shelves. On window ledges. In boxes...

(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:

BEATRICE
Yes. Call me if you have a
brainwave. My life will be
miserable otherwise.

ROLAND
I'll have a think. I'm sure I've
seen it recently... 'Bye.

CLICK. Roland puts down the phone. But he's already
gripped by an idea. He runs his fingers along the shelves.
Scanning for a title. He moves to another pile, rapid
search --

ROLAND
(from memory)

The Shadowy Portal... An
autobiographical reminiscence... by

Mrs. Hella Lees...
Roland darts from shelf to box, repeating his mantra --

ROLAND
the London Library copy...

Until like a divining rod, his hands guide him to a pile of
books behind a box. Roland dives in, brings out --

A book. It's old. With gilded leaves, an embossed dove on
the cover. And in the frontispiece -- an oval photograph of
Mrs. Lees. Roland leafs through the

pages --

ROLAND
The seance... of course, the
seance...

He takes the copy, sits down in an armchair. Finds a
chapter, headed "A Mummy Possest?" As he starts to read, a
cat jumps up, curls 'round him. Over Roland, reading --

Lights, let the seance begin...

A circular table: seven ladies, four men; they clasp hands.
Ash takes a seat in the circle.

MRS. LEES
(to spirit world)
We are ready to receive you, if your
spirit stands at the threshold, we
ask you to reveal yourself. Is
anybody there...?

Mrs. Lees taps the table. Ash scans the circle, his eyes
hit those of a woman opposite. A sharp intake of breath as

MRS. LEES
I feel hands. As cold as ice...

The table vibrates. Ash watches Mrs. Lees shake
uncontrollably. A spirit voice speaks through her --

MRS. LEES
“Do not force me...'
(as herself)
Who is it?
(as voice)
“Nobodaddy...'

Ash sees a halo of electromagnetic force like fire surround
Mrs. Lees. Suddenly Ash feels a TAPPING shake the table. A
breeze lifts skirts. Ash hears a WOMAN SOB, then LAUGHTER.

MRS. LEES
There is a hostile presence in the
room. Is there a spirit who wishes
to speak?
The sound of RUNNING WATER. Ash looks at the woman
opposite: and recognizes Christabel, who speaks in a
trance, a spirit voice possesses her.

(CONTINUED)
gl.
CONTINUED:

CHRISTABEL
(in a spirit voice)
“Remember the stones...!
(in her own voice)
Where are you?
(in the spirit
voice)
“I bring gifts...!

MRS. LEES
She is possessed. A spirit is with
us...

Ash wants to go over to her. But the circle's hands hold
onto him. He hears RUSHING WATER boom LOUDER, then
sees --

A vision of a white hand carrying a white wreath, hanging
from the chandelier by threads. The circle clasps hands
again --

MRS. LEES
Let her go... the spirit has
entranced her... Do not wake her...

As Blanche's spirit manifests itself --

MRS. LEES
You bring a message of love...?

But an ELECTROMAGNETIC CURRENT CRACKLES, holds Ash's hands
fast. Ash struggles to get free --

ASH
I must speak...

Ash moves towards Christabel. But the wreath tangles him in
threads like a web. He tries to break free, but ghostly
hands wrap around his throat --

ASH
Away, foul spirit. I beg you --

Ash turns to see a ghostly face of Blanche. In rage, he
raises the wreath in his hands. Mrs. Lees pleads --

MRS. LEES
-- Don't break the spell -- her
spirit will be harmed forever -- !

But Ash hurls the wreath away, a SHRIEK as Blanche's spirit

disappears. Ash rushes at Christabel, who almost faints in

her trance. He holds her in his arms, removes her mask --
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ASH
Speak, I beg you... I came to
France... you turned me away, my
darling... For God's sake, answer...

tell me the truth... I must know...
Weeping, Ash cradles Christabel in his arms.
ASH
Where is she...? Is she not dead?
Tell me... Tell me what you have
done...
Ash bends to hear Christabel's whisper.

CHRISTABEL
You have made me... a murderess.

Christabel collapses. Guests try to pull Ash away from her.
He howls in pain and rage --

ASH
Dead...? No-o-oo -- !!

Ash pushes over a candle flame, which spills over. Mrs.
Lees comes to her senses.
HER POV

around Ash a fiery halo of red.

BACK TO SCENE

MRS. LEES
Sir, you are a demon... Go now...

Ash stands up, a force of red light surrounding him. He
looks at his own hands, sees them -- smeared in translucent
blood.

END OF FLASHBACK.
SMASH CUT TO:

INT. CONVENT OF ST. ANNE (BRITTANY, FRANCE) - LIBRARY
- DAY

In a cavernous library lined with ancient tomes, at a long
oak table, Maud finishes work for the day. Around her, nuns
put away leather volumes, ready to close up. Maud picks up
her notebooks, piles of photocopied documents. Exits into -
93.
EXT. CONVENT OF ST. ANNE (BRITTANY) - LIBRARY - DAY

A cloistered courtyard of a medieval convent. RAIN POURS
down. She passes nuns scurrying about their business,
sheltered by the old cloister roofs. In her brisk, modern
clothes, Maud is a surreal contrast, as she emerges to see -

A young, chic French scholar, DR. ARIANE LE MINIER.

EXT. BRITTANY COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Inside a battered Renault, WINDSCREEN WIPERS SLOOSH BACK AND
FORTH, as Le Minier and Maud drive into a small town.

LE MINIER
When I sent my discoveries to
Professor Stern, I hoped she would
notify you. I am a great admirer of
your writings on Christabel.

MAUD
You couldn't have been more helpful,
Ariane.

LE MINIER

The photocopier is a great
democratic invention, no...?

As Le Minier talks, Maud stares through windscreen wipers,
in a blur of rain and glass, she suddenly sees --

HER POV - AT SIDE OF ROAD

Two bedraggled figures, one of them Christabel, distressed
and crying, holding out her hands. Maud focusses on her as
the CAR ZOOMS past -- Their eyes meet -- as --

LE MINIER (0.S.)
We should share our information,
should we not? Is it not a feminist
principle, cooperation?

BACK TO SCENE

Maud snaps back, answers with a smile. Le Minier buzzes
along the country roads, heading for the nearby small town.
94.
EXT. HOTEL (LA CAP COZ, BRITTANY) - DAY

Rain pours down. Le Minier sets Maud down nearby her hotel
in a provincial seaside town, near a sandy bay and dark sea.
As Maud runs to the entrance, she sees someone sheltering

from the elements. Hunched over, slumped, drenched by rain

On closer inspection, she sees -- Roland. Shocked at first,
she warms to a smile. As Roland looks up, anorak collar
pulled up. And through the rain, they rush together, throw
arms 'round each other. Then slowly pull apart --

ROLAND
We must be mad.

MAUD
Of course we are mad.

Roland pauses as if about to say something important. And
sneezes.

INT. HOTEL (LE CAP COZ, BRITTANY) - DAY

In her bedroom, Roland sits, feet in a bowl of steaming
water. He wraps a towel 'round his head, as he and Maud
share their discoveries.

ROLAND
She was there. Christabel was there
at the seance. But Ash was so full
of rage --

MAUD
Or grief. He believed Christabel
was responsible for someone's death.
The question is -- “Who?!

ROLAND
Blanche, of course. You said no one
knew where Christabel was when
Blanche committed suicide.

MAUD
Until now. That's what I found from
Leonora's letter. Christabel had
family in Brittany. A young cousin
who wrote a journal. A French
researcher found fragments of poems
by Christabel dated Spring 1860.
This is where she was. Until now,
nobody knew...

Maud takes the towel, rubs Roland's hair dry.

(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:

ROLAND
I wish nobody knew where I was.

MAUD
Me too. I've lied shamelessly to
Leonora. I even stole Dr. Le
Minier's address.

ROLAND
All scholars are a bit crazy.

Roland sneezes, blows his nose. He's in a bad way, his
towel like a turban, balanced on his head.

MAUD
Roland, you said Ash came to France.
When exactly -- ?

ROLAND
Spring, 1860...

MAUD
Exactly?

ROLAND
Around... March.

MAUD

So think about it, Roland.
(Roland is blank)

How long is that after Ash and

Christabel were in Whitby?

Under his turban, Roland does his sums. Maud knows the
answer.

ROLAND
About... eight... no... Nine months.

MAUD
Nine months.

Maud stares at Roland. Who gasps with surprise. As he
dries his hair, he freezes. A sudden realization --

ROLAND
A... child.

EXT. BRITTANY - INTERCUT VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY/NIGHT

Out walking -- two figures, Christabel with her young
cousin, SABINE. Christabel's pale face, unwell, under
strain.

(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
CHRISTABEL
And how do you think things are with
me, cousin Sabine?

Christabel turns her face away. Sabine sees she is weeping.

CONVENT

Christabel knocking on the door. Then INSIDE the courtyard.
A cloak conceals her figure. INSIDE an office, a nun pulls
aside the cloak. Pregnant. Then --

CUT BACK TO:
ROLAND
ROLAND
If there was a baby, did it survive?
MAUD
I don't know.
ROLAND

Though if it survived --

MAUD
Ash could have believed she was
trying to speak to her child in the

seance.

ROLAND
Her dead child. But if Ash ever
knew --

MAUD

In the records of the Convent, they
record a visit by a gentleman who
answers Ash's description. He was
turned away. They never spoke
again...

INT. HOTEL (LE CAP COZ, BRITTANY) - DAY
Maud and Roland go downstairs, peering over the bannister.

Suddenly, they freeze. In the lobby of the hotel, they see

Leonora Stern with Blackadder, canoodling fondly.

MAUD
Oh, no...
97.
IN LOBBY
Roland and Maud overhear Leonora with Blackadder.

LEONORA
I don't understand why Maud dashed
off without a word. That letter
from Le Minier was mine, after all.
We were good friends...
(beat)

Perhaps your Roland Michell is some
kind of macho boss-man.

BLACKADDER
He's not forceful. It's his major
failing.

LEONORA

Then it must be love.

BACK ON STAIRS
Maud and Roland sneak back to their room.

MAUD
Should we go and confront them?

Maud puts out both her hands. Roland takes them.
ROLAND

I think we should. And I think we

can't.
INT./EXT. HOTEL (LE CAP COZ, BRITTANY) - DAY
As Leonora and Blackadder, in bright leisurewear and
sunglasses, stride out from the hotel. Roland and Maud
sneak out of the entrance into -- a taxi CAB.
Which ZOOMS off at high speed, passing them on the
esplanade.
EXT. PORT (CAEN, BRITTANY) - EVE
At a cross-channel port, an overnight ferry in dock. Roland
and Maud walk up the gangway, into the passenger sections.

INT. FERRY BOAT CABIN - EVE

Inside the tiny cabin, Roland and Maud put down their bags
and investigate. A white room. Twin bunks.

(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:

Shower. They seem light-headed and giddy. Roland takes
stock.

ROLAND
These are clean narrow white beds.
Just like we always wanted.

MAUD
So they are. Do you prefer top or
bottom?

ROLAND
I don't see that it matters. And
you?

MAUD

I'll take the top.
Suddenly, perfectly aware of the absurdity and sexual
ambiguity of it all, they laugh out loud.
EXT. FERRY BOAT - NIGHT
Night time. Outside, the WATER HISSES and PRICKLES. Dark
waves carved by the huge boat... as down below --
INT. FERRY BOAT - CABIN - NIGHT
On a low light, Roland and Maud lie together, back to back

on the bottom bunk, ankles overlapping. Maud is reflective,
muted. Neither can sleep.

MAUD
I feel sad about Christabel's
baby...

ROLAND

We don't know it was dead.

MAUD
I can't help thinking... if it
wasn't destined to die, why did she
run away? Why didn't she stay where
she was safe?

ROLAND
Maybe she meant no one to know what
happened. Not even us...
Roland turns toward Maud. Who is still turned away.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

99.

ROLAND
I think I've lost everything I've
ever had or cared about. Ash. My
job. Even Val now...

MAUD
Oh...?

ROLAND

She walked out. I should feel
frightful. But if I had to tell the
truth...

(beat)
I want... that life, Maud. Ash and
Christabel's. I'm not afraid to
admit it.

Roland puts his hand on Maud's, looks directly at her. His
face next to hers, a moment of truth.

ROLAND
I know it sounds crazy --

MAUD
I thought you were like me. You
wanted the empty room.

ROLAND
I did. Now I'm not so sure.

MAUD
No, please -- I can't -- I don't
want to lose myself. Do you
understand how important that is?

ROLAND
Yes -- but -- to live life so
powerfully. Does anyone do that
anymore?

MAUD
Not me -- too romantic. Life isn't
like that.

ROLAND
Maybe that's why we read books, you
and me.

Silence overtakes them. Comfortable and safe, the swell of
the SEA hushes them. The WIND outside CARRIES OVER INTO --
100.

FLASHBACK - INT. ASH'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - LIBRARY
- NIGHT (1859)

At the open window, a lace curtain billows in the breeze.
Ellen closes the window. She walks into the library, a FIRE
ROARS.

At a desk, Ash looks through a microscope: At a dead
butterfly. Its intricate patterns. A pin is poised over
the sample. Yet his mind is on something else. He gets up,
moves behind her. Ellen stops.

ASH
Ellen, I have something I must tell
you.

Ellen turns to him. Ash pauses, then words tumble out.

ASH
For the last year, I have been in
love with another woman. I could
say it was a sort of madness. A
possession, as by demons. A kind of
blinding. At first it was only
letters -- and then -- in Yorkshire
-- I was not alone --

ELLEN
I know.

Ellen looks up at Ash, his proud crest fallen.

ASH
How long?

ELLEN
I was told. I had a visitor.

Ellen unlocks a drawer. Brings out the original copy of
Ash's poem, in an envelope addressed to "Miss La Motte,
Bethany..."

ELLEN

The original version of your poem.
Certain passages are superior, I
think, to what you now have here.

(beat)
I sensed a new inspiration. A muse.
As I would care to inspire you, were
I a poet.

Silence. Ash is speechless, deep in thought.

(CONTINUED)
1ol.

CONTINUED:

ASH
If I had not told you about this --
about Miss La Motte -- would you
have restored this to me?

ELLEN
I think not. How could I? But you
have told me.

ASH
Miss Blanche Glover gave you this?

CLOSEUP - ELLEN
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT./INT. ASH'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - DAY (1859)

Up at the window, the lace curtain flutters out on the
breeze.

Inside, in the reception room -- a letter is flung onto a
table.

ELLEN (V.0.)
She wrote twice. And came here...
On the envelope: Ash's handwriting: Inside, a manuscript
of a poem. Addressed to "Christabel La Motte..." Ellen
stares at it.

She turns away from -- Blanche. Who paces up and down in
her neat worn boots, clasping and unclasping her hands.

BLANCHE
Your own happiness is ruined, is a
lie. You could help me if you
chose. We were so happy --

From the table, Ellen picks up a bell. She rings it.

ELLEN
I can do nothing about your
happiness, Miss Glover. Please
leave my house.

A maid comes to the door. Ellen stares at her. Blanche
pauses. Then exits. Ellen turns away.

DISSOLVE TO:
102.

INT. ASH'S HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - LIBRARY - NIGHT (1859

Ash before Ellen, stumbling to find words.

ASH
I do not know what to say, Ellen. I
do not expect to see her -- Miss La

Motte again. We were agreed that
this one summer must see the end --

of...
(voice trembles)
the end. And even if that were
not so -- she has vanished, she has
gone away --

Ellen hears Ash's pain, notes it, says nothing.

A silence

ASH
You must be angry -- distressed --

ELLEN
Not angry. I know how gentle and
patient you have been with me. For
I have never been a real wife to
you...

ASH
Ellen, do not --

ELLEN
If I have not proffered the proper
intimacy between husband and wife,
that is my regret, Randolph.
(beat)
Yet you have never ceased to love
me.

falls between them.

ASH
You are my wife, Ellen. I shall
always love you.

ELLEN
Then, as you have forgiven me, so I
shall forgive you.

Ellen wipes a tear from her eye, looks up at Ash.

ELLEN
It is a question of silence. Let us
not talk of it again, Randolph.

Ellen gently responds, touching his hand. NOISES FADE IN
from a MODERN-DAY STATION, as we --

DISSOLVE BACK UP TO:
103.
EXT. VICTORIA STATION - DAY (PRESENT)

A busy train station. Roland and Maud emerge on a platform,
push through crowds. Roland looks up to see: a wild figure
dashing up the platform: Beatrice, waving frantically.

ROLAND
Beatrice -- ?

Beatrice arrives, huffing and puffing, out of breath.

BEATRICE
Oh dear. I am sorry. You may think
I'm mad, or bad, or presumptuous --
I could only think of you --

MAUD
Dr. Nest -- Beatrice -- please...

BEATRICE
I wouldn't have come unless you
seemed to care about her --

ROLAND
About...

BEATRICE
Her... Ellen.
(beat; as if it was

obvious)
I have to tell you both something.
It's urgent.

INT. ASH HOUSE MUSEUM (RUSSELL SQUARE) - NIGHT (SUNSET)

Back indoors, a cup of tea freshly made, Beatrice is back
under control. Roland and Maud listen, as Beatrice calms
down.

BEATRICE
Mortimer Cropper was here today.
Looking at sections of Ellen's
journal.

MAUD
About Blanche's visit?

Beatrice looks at them both. Very serious.
BEATRICE
No. About Ash's funeral. He
brought young Hildebrand Ash.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
104.

CONTINUED:

BEATRICE (CONT'D)
I'm absolutely certain Cropper wants
to open up Ash's tomb. He wants to
find out what is in the box.

MAUD
What box?

BEATRICE
Ellen's.

ROLAND

The one Ellen buried in Ash's tomb.

Maud sits down with Roland, now surrounded by Beatrice and

Maud.

BEATRICE
I don't know what to do. They all
dislike me so -- they think Ellen's
diary is unimportant. I've been
thinking...
(beat)
Ellen wrote to baffle us.

ROLAND
What do you mean?

BEATRICE

She wrote so much. To throw us off
the scent.

(beat)
I believe she must have known if
there was a child... what happened
to it. How it died. That's why she
buried the truth in a box...

From a leather portfolio, Beatrice removes an old scrap of

paper.

BEATRICE

She left this scrap of paper in her
desk when she died. I'm sure Ellen
knew the scavengers would come --
sooner or later...

(reciting from memory )
“What shall I be without you?
My Randolph now is gone...'

Beatrice stands in front of the glass cases, from inside,
Roland and Maud hear a FLUTTERING sound. As if the
BUTTERFLIES are suddenly alive, fluttering wings, trying to

escape,

as --

105.
CONTINUED:
With Maud, he follows Beatrice towards the old bedroom.

BEATRICE
Follow me...

Beatrice walks into the old bedroom, past the glass cases
and portraits, the aquarium and books of the first dreamlike
shot --

As if Beatrice has become Ellen's ghost...

CUT TO:

FLASHBACK - INT. ASH'S HOUSE (LONDON) - BEDROOM - NIGHT
(1888)

Ellen leans over her dying husband. Ash lies in bed,
propped up on pillows. He is dying.

ASH
Forty-four years with no anger. I
do not think many husbands and wives
can say as much...
(beat)
It cannot be helped. Do you think,
after death, we continue...?

Ellen bows her head, begins to weep.

ASH
Do not cry. I am not sorry. I have
not -- done nothing, you know. I

have lived.

Ellen sees Ash clutching in his hand a gold pocket watch: a
long, plaited chain of gold hair tied around it.

ASH
Do not let me be picked by vultures.
Burn what they should not see...

Ellen unwinds her hair from his hands. A KNOCK at the door.
As she gets up to go, Ash moans deliriously --

ASH
Summer fields... in a twinkling of
an eye, I saw her. I should have
looked after her. How could 1? I
could only hurt her...

(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:

ELLEN
You saw who? In the summer fields?
You saw who, Randolph?

ASH
(after a pause)
I... forgot...

Ash falls back asleep, his hand clutches the watch with the
golden hair which Ellen will also later bury. Ellen goes to
the door, opens it to a doctor. As he enters, Ellen turns
back --

To look at her husband -- a moan as she sees he is --

Dead. A wind blows her candle, smoke past tearful eyes.

INT. ASH HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - LATER THAT NIGHT

ON a ROARING FIRE, flames burn up papers. Ellen watches,
throws more on. At her husband's desk --

ELLEN
What shall I be without you?

(NOTE: The one Roland and Maud now read, lies on the desk.)
She takes a packet of letters, tied with ribbons. She
hesitates.

Instead of throwing them on the fire, Ellen walks toward a
box...

ELLEN (V.0.)
~-- My Randolph now is gone.
Tomorrow we will set out together on
his last blind journey...'

She unlocks the box, removes an envelope, addressed to
"Randolph Ash." The broken seal recognizable as
Christabel's: a crest of arms, a shield held up by a
unicorn and centaur.

Ellen goes to the bed-stand: a pocket watch with a plait of
golden hair wrapped around the chain-ring.

ELLEN (V.0.)
... And these letters and mementoes
-- why do I choose to put them up,
in their sealed enclosure...?

On the desk beside Ellen's note, an open box. She
hesitates, holding the letters in her hand, then --
107.
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY (1888)

As in the opening -- the same box. Closed and sealed in
Ellen's hands. PULL BACK to reveal: mourners in black.
Ellen walks forward with the box --

ELLEN (V.0.)
'... I want them to have a sort of
duration. A demi-eternity...'

Places the box in the mausoleum near Ash's coffin.

ELLEN (V.0.)
'... And if the seekers dig them out
again...?'

On cue, the GATES CLOSE WITH a THUD. The box now locked and
sealed in the mausoleum --

ELLEN (V.0.)
'... Then justice will perhaps be
done to her when I am not here to
see it.'

END OF FLASHBACK.

INT. ASH'S HOUSE MUSEUM - NIGHT

In the shadowy twilight, Beatrice looks out from the
darkness. She takes back her precious note from Roland and
Maud.

. ROLAND
Justice will perhaps be done to
her.' Who did she mean?
BEATRICE

I've asked myself that question all
these years. A scholar's
lifetime...

MAUD
If Cropper digs it up, he can keep
the truth hidden forever.

ROLAND
So what can we do? We'd need to
catch him in the act --

BEATRICE

Or get to the box before him --
ROLAND

You mean, break in... to the tomb?

(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:

BEATRICE
I know it sounds... barbaric.

MAUD
This note you've shown us -- no one
else has seen it?

BEATRICE
(shaking her head)
No one else has asked. They don't
think Ellen is important. But, you
see? She is.

Roland looks at Maud, an unaccustomed glint in his eye.

ROLAND
Then we need to go now.

EXT. INN (NEAR CEMETERY) - NIGHT

An 18th Century inn with mossy roof and orchard, near a
village church. Beneath a large tree, the dark shape of a
Mercedes. Trunk open, with Cropper and Hildebrand
inspecting lights, shovels, ropes.

HILDEBRAND
I suppose we could leave false
clues. Blame it on the Satanists.
A black mass or something...

Hildebrand snorts with laughter. Cropper frowns.

CROPPER
I am not a common thief. It's only
that box -- the thought of it
decaying in the ground -- the
thought of perhaps never
knowing --

He closes the trunk. Cropper and Hildebrand walk over to
the inn, and enter, VOICES CARRYING OVER inside --

EXT. ROADS TO CEMETERY - NIGHT

On hilly roads, Maud drives her car through thickening mist,
Roland at her side. They pass the trip in silence, each

waiting for the other to speak.

MAUD
You packed the things?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

109.

ROLAND
Sure.
MAUD
The crowbar?
ROLAND
Yes. The crowbar.
MAUD
We might need it. Aren't you

worried -- ?

Maud glances over towards him, her excitement palpable.
Then -- she swerves to avoid a truck; Roland winces, sighs.

ROLAND
I don't worry about anything. Not
now. At the moment, I feel all --
clear in the head -- if you know
what I mean.

They sit in silence as she zooms down a narrow side street
through the fog. Then down a steep hill with trees on both

sides.

MAUD
Roland, I'm sorry how it turned out.
ROLAND
For who?
MAUD
You. And me. I think I was afraid.
ROLAND
I don't think so. Not you. Of
what?
MAUD

Of falling in love with you.

ROLAND
I didn't know you wanted to...
That's over now, anyway. I don't
want you to love me.

MAUD
You don't?

(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
ROLAND
No. Too complicated. I can't think
about 'us' anymore.
The fog grows thicker, as if they're driving back in
time --

FLASHBACK - INT. ASH'S HOUSE - DAY (1888)

Illuminated in a flash of lightning: as the beginning --
FOOTSTEPS. A hand KNOCKS on a door. Three knocks.

MAID (0.8.)
Mrs. Ash...?

END OF FLASHBACK.

RETURN TO:

EXT. ROADS NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

Roland slams on the brakes. Swirling fog clears to reveal -

A hound like Christabel's companion from Seal Court, in the
road. The animal vanishes behind another cloud of fog.
Roland and Maud drive slowly forward. The fog grows more
misty --

COVERING the SCREEN as we --
RETURN TO:

FLASHBACK - INT. ASH'S HOUSE - DAY (1888)

The same hand KNOCKING on the door. Details become clearer,
as we REVEAL. Again the KNOCKING. A hushed servant's
voice:

MAID (0.8.)
Mrs. Ash... a letter.

Sound of RAIN ON GLASS. HORSES' HOOVES ON COBBLESTONES.
The door opens to reveal Ellen, facing her young MAID.

MAID
A lady called Miss La Motte came to
the door. She gave me this letter
for your husband. She said it was
very important.

Ellen takes an envelope from the girl's hand, closes the
door.
111.
CLOSEUP - LETTER
The coat of arms from Seal Court. In Christabel's
handwriting: "To Randolph Henry Ash Esq -- Most Urgent."
And her name: "From: Christabel La Motte, Seal Court,
Lincolnshire."

Ellen takes the letter. Slowly, softly, she walks into the

BEDROOM

Where Ash lies in bed, deathly ill. As Ellen picks up the
letter, she holds it to her, unable to let it go --

Poised over a candle's flame --

EXT. INN (NEAR CEMETERY) - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Peering through the bar window, Roland sees Cropper eating
and drinking with Hildebrand and Fergus. He sneaks back to
Maud, standing by Cropper's Merc.

ROLAND
They're all there. Cropper,
Hildebrand, even Fergus.

MAUD
Roland, did you bring a knife?

ROLAND
Yes. Do you need it?

MAUD
Yes, I do.

Roland brings out a knife from his bag. Without warning,
Maud takes it over to the Merc, stabs one tire. Then the
other. AIR RUSHES OUT. The TIRES PUNCTURE fast.

MAUD
All right -- shall we?

Roland stares at Maud and the knife. Both is disbelief.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Maud and Roland pull up on the hill near the cemetery gates.
On the gates, a sign: "STRICTLY NO ADMITTANCE" Nearby a
large wall, where they place a ladder.

Up over the wall, into the cemetery they go.

(CONTINUED)
lle.
CONTINUED:
Walking through the graveyard, ‘round long curved avenues of
the necropolis. As if, from the tombstones and graves,

voices fill the air.

. CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
My dear, my dear...'

HOLD ON Roland and Maud as they disappear up the hill, into
the gloomy darkness among the trees waving in the breeze.

INT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
Near the mausoleum, the tomb awaits, the box inside.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
I ask for your forgiveness for
intruding on you at this time. I am
told you are gravely ill...'

INSIDE CABINET

HOLD ON the letter, its flap of envelope open. We hear a
voice, MOVE TOWARDS it, until white paper FILLS the SCREEN.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
... I have writ down some things I
dearly wish you should know...'

FLASHBACK - INT. SEAL COURT - DAY (1888)
As in Roland and Maud's earlier journey, we CLIMB UP --

A winding spiral staircase leading to a tower bedroom, walls
now freshly-pained, Christabel's dolls -- where Maud and
Roland find the letters a century later -- kept neatly on
their bed.

A woman sits at her desk, talking softly as she composes a
letter. It is Christabel, now an old woman, in her 60s.

CHRISTABEL

I sit here like an old witch in
a tower. You will say to me, it
should have been told, twenty-eight
years ago. I know -- I have known
for these many years -- that I have
done you wrong. Yet, my guilt for
all that happened made it
impossible...'

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Christabel drifts to the window. Golden summer sun floods
in.

CHRISTABEL
The truth is, that you have a
daughter, who is well, and married,
and the mother of a wonderful boy.'

She looks down from her isolation onto the grass knoll
below, so well-kept in its day. A beautiful woman in her
late 20s, MAIA BAILEY, plays with her baby boy.

CHRISTABEL
... She is beautiful, and called
Maia, and resembles, I think, both
her parents, neither of which she
knows to be her parents...!

Christabel turns from the window, lost in her memories.

FLASHBACK - EXT. FIELD (BRITTANY) - NIGHT (1860)

Christabel's memories. We are FLYING OVER rugged winter
terrain before a farmhouse, TOWARDS a barn in Brittany,
decades ago.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)

. We agreed to leave each other
and never look back. And for
pride's sake, and yours, I resolved
to keep my side of it. When I
discovered my condition, Blanche and
I quarrelled bitterly. I could not
come to you. So I made arrangements
-- I found a place to go in France -
- but you came searching after
me...'

The doors of the barn open for us, and we CREEP PAST cows
and mules that stare TOWARDS us.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
So I fled, I fled...'

We REACH a haystack in the back, where the squatting
Christabel trembles in agony. CIRCLE AROUND, we see her
sweat-drenched face.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
I concluded that no decent
refuge remained fit for me...'

She opens her mouth to scream, as --
114.
INT. CHRISTABEL AND BLANCHE'S HOUSE (RICHMOND) - 1859
CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
... And when I thought of poor
Blanche...'
INT. SITTING ROOM

Alone, Blanche sewing pockets of a dress: stones (from
Whitby) expertly bound with needle and thread...

ON TABLE
A suicide note in Blanche's writing, placed on a desk: "To
whom it may concern..." Weighed down by a stone.

EXT. THAMES RIVER - CHELSEA BRIDGE - 1859

Upon a bridge, Blanche looks into swirling waters of a dark
river. In her pockets, silvery-black stones sewn in by
thread. As she walks to the precipice of the bridge, and
jumps --

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
I knew I had killed her...'

UNDERWATER

At the bottom of the river, Blanche tumbles, bubbles slowly
expiring from her mouth. Her body weighed down by the
fossil stones, she floats eerily in the cold darkness...

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
I could not face the world.
Nor you...'

EXT. CLIFFS (BRITTANY) - 1860

In a dark cloak, Christabel, alone, facing out to sea. At
her lowest ebb. Distraught, tears streaming down her
cheeks.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
I felt haunted, cursed, and
alone...'

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
115.

INT. SEAL COURT - CHRISTABEL'S ROOM - DAY (1888)
Despite the memory, Christabel's face is calm and peaceful.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
... So I gave dear Maia to my
sister Sophie Bailey, who brought
her up as her own...'

Christabel wanders into the shadows of her room, which are
covered with stacks of papers. A lifetime of words.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)

... Now I want to make amends, let
these ghosts rest in peace. I have
flown about the battlements of this
stronghold, crying on the wind of my
need to see and feed and comfort my
child, who knows me not and -- to
whom can I say this, but you? -- who
loves me not...'

She returns to the window.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
And yet, she is so happy. Ah,
but if you were here, you would see
how I dare not disturb her peace...!'

CLOSEUP ON YOUNG MAIA'S FACE

She looks up, perhaps her eyes meet Christabel's. But the
young mother quickly averts them.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
... I have been angry for so long -
- with all of us, with you, with
Blanche, with my poor self... and
now, near the end, I think of you
with clear love...'

She moves to her desk, signs her name to the letter, then
picks up a small art-nouveau picture frame. She removes the

photo.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
: I send you her picture. She
will have nothing of her strange
name, and prefers to be called May,
which suits her...'
116.
CLOSEUP ON PHOTO

of a woman on her wedding day. Original of the photo on
Maud's mantelpiece, her great-great-grandmother, May.

CHRISTABEL (V.0.)
... Did we not -- did you not
flame, and I catch fire? Is that
not fine? Shall we survive and rise
from our ashes...?'

ON CHRISTABEL'S FACE

as she prepares to part with her photo. A burst of sunshine
surges through the window.

She is consumed in white. As the light slowly fades, we
HOLD ON photo, but now it's old, faded, and in muddy hands.

END OF FLASHBACK.
DISSOLVE THROUGH and REVEAL --

EXT. CEMETERY - DAWN

Rain starts. The sun is about to rise. Roland and Maud sit
at the graveyard by the mausoleum. On the ground --

MAUD
(reading letter)
... And so, "in the calm of mind,
all passion spent," I thank God --
if there must be a dragon -- that he
was you.'

The box has been opened, the letter (with crest) sits out of
its envelope, photos in their hands, watch with its braided
lock of golden hair. Roland holds it against Maud's own
hair.

ROLAND
It's her. May. She was...
MAUD
My great-great-grandmother, yes.
May...
ROLAND

Now I know why they left all this --
the clues, the poems, the letters.
They wanted you to know, Maud. They
left them for you.

(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED:

Holding the old crumpled pictures of May, Maud is overcome.

MAUD
She looks like Christabel. You can
see it.

ROLAND

She looks like you. She looks like
Randolph Henry Ash, too.

MAUD
So I look like Ash?

A hint of lightness. Roland smiles, gently touches her
face.

ROLAND
I would never have thought of it.
But yes -- here, at the corner of

the eyebrow -- the edge of the mouth

MAUD
Now you see it, you'll always see it

ROLAND
I'll never be free of it.

MAUD
No. We'll never be free.

Maud smiles too, looks up at Roland, as if for the first
time. Roland reaches out to her, holds her close to him.

ROLAND
Maud... I... love you so much...

The ice queen melts. Maud buries her face, tears fall.

ROLAND
I just love you. That's how it is.

Maud raises her arms to him, his hands stroke her wet hair,
tracing the curves of her shivering body. As --

MAUD
The worst possible way then.

They pull away for an instant.

(CONTINUED)
118.
CONTINUED:

ROLAND
Yes, total obsession. The worst...

They move closer. Roland knows her heart is barely
triumphing over her fear. Fighting every inch of the way,
Maud softly brings her lips to his. A heartbeat away from
a...

Long, lingering kiss. Until --

Maud opens her eyes, looks up slowly. And behind Roland,
sees -- over the brow of the hill, a familiar figure:

Beatrice. Smiling, white hair streaming in the rain.
Roland swivels around, to see --

A gathering crowd of sodden, desperate scholars: Beatrice,
Cropper, Hildebrand, Fergus, gloomy; ever Blackadder and
Leonora.

INT. INN (NEAR CEMETERY)

RAIN POURS down. In the bar, around a fireplace, a muddy
crew of scholars, in pajamas and dressing gowns, drink hot
toddies; Blackadder and Leonora hold hands, in love.
Beatrice passes around the letters.

BLACKADDER
How strange for Maud to be descended
from both Ash and Christabel...

FERGUS
Yes. Your lives' work, all in
vain...

CROPPER

No, no. I sensed it all along. The
old Cropper instinct. I knew it was
something vast...

BEATRICE
I can imagine Ellen. She didn't
even read it. Just put it away --
BLACKADDER
For Maud. As it turns out. She
preserved it for Maud.

BEATRICE
Poor Ash. He never knew... never
knew..

(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED:

Looking to Leonora, for once speechless, gazing at a damp
letter.

LEONORA
Wow.

PULL BACK from the discussion -- TO upstairs -- where --

INT. INN (NEAR CEMETERY) - ROOM
THROUGH the windows of the 18th Century inn --

In a white room, with a white four-poster, with white-veiled
curtains. Maud and Roland by a white bed.

ROLAND
I'm afraid of it, too. Just like
you.
MAUD
What cowards we are, after all.
(beat)
Kiss me.
ROLAND

That's what I was afraid of.

Behind the white veils, Maud finally kisses Roland, softly
at first, then with all her repressed passion, as they lie
down upon the bed --

DOWN BY BED - BOX

And beside it -- the WATCH. With its plait of golden hair,
where we HOLD for a moment. Until, weakly, fitfully, the
sweeping second-hand gasps out a few inexplicable TICKS --
enough to let us know --

It is alive.

ASH (V.0.)
There are things that happen and
leave no discernible trace, are not
spoken of or written of, as though
such things have never been. Two
people met, on a hot May day, and
never mentioned the meeting...

DISSOLVE TO:

FLASHBACK - EXT. MEADOW (SEAL COURT) - DAY (1868)
The same WATCH, TICKING...

In the hands of a man, walking down a country lane on a hot
May day of bright sunlight and BUZZING INSECTS. Nearby, a
meadow full of flowers, like a Monet: blue cornflowers,
scarlet poppies, a carpet of yellow daisies sway in the
breeze.

Up a lane, walks a bearded man in a black, wide-brimmed hat.
From cool shadows, he stares wistfully out in the distance,
at -- the gothic towers of Seal Court. The old man is hot,
wipes his brow.

As he catches his breath, a nearby CREAKING sound, to and
fro, distracts him. Yet so intense is his stare, he hardly
notices a young GIRL (8), swinging on a gate.

GIRL
Hello! Are you lost?

The Girl, in blue dress and white pinafore, hums to herself,
making a daisy chain. The man looks down at her: he is
Ash.

ASH
Am I -- ? Oh, hello. Yes... I was
looking up at yonder house. Do you
know it?

GIRL
That house? Of course I do. That's
my house.

ASH
(beat)
Is it really?

Suddenly curious, Ash cocks his head towards her, lowers
himself on one knee. A gentle matter-of-fact tenderness.

ASH
Well, you are a very fortunate girl.
(holding out his
hand)
My name is Randolph Ash. How do you
do? May I know yours?

GIRL (MAY)
My name is May Bailey. I have
another name also, but I do not like
it.

(CONTINUED)

ASH
I think I know your mother. You
have a true look of your mother.

MAY
No one else says that. I think I
look like my father.

ASH
I think you have a look of your
father, too.

Ash puts his arms around her waist, lifts her down to his
side. Mays sits, pulling grass, surrounded by a cloud of
butterflies.

Ash hunts

ASH

You seem very happy.
MAY

Oh, yes. I am, I am.

(beat)
Can you make daisy chains?

ASH
I will make you a crown for a May
Queen. But you must give me
something in exchange.

MAY
I haven't got anything to give.

ASH
Oh, just a lock of hair. To
remember you by.

MAY
Like a fairy story.

ASH
Just so.

And very gently cuts a long lock from her golden

MAY
Here. I'll plait it for you, to
keep it tidy.

May's fingers set to work, Ash gathers up twigs, ferns,

flowers.

(CONTINUED)
122.
CONTINUED:

ASH
I'll make you a crown, like a
fairy's child. Or like Proserpine.
Do you know any poetry?

MAY
I have an Aunt Christabel who is
always telling me poems. But I
don't like poetry.

ASH
I am sorry you don't like poetry, as
I am a poet.

MAY
Oh, I like you. You make lovely
things and don't fuss.

ASH
If I wrote down a message, would you
be kind enough to deliver it to your
aunt?

MAY
A message? What will it say?

ASH
Simply that you met a poet, who was
looking for his fairy goddess, and
who met you instead, and who sends
her his compliments, and will not
disturb her, and is on his way to
fresh woods and pastures anew.

Ash locks into May's eyes. A moment he will remember with
absolute clarity, but which will fade in her memory over the
years. Tiny beetles crawl about their feet.

They go back to working beneath the sun. A man and a girl,
content to share one moment of their lives. As a breeze
floats through, ruffling the leaves around them --

DISSOLVE TO:

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

Ash stands by the gate, watching May run through the meadow,
note in hand, daisy crown upon her head. Ash winds her
blonde hair-plait around the chain of his watch.

CONTINUED:
May climbs up a hill towards Seal Court, where her brothers
ambush her. They rough and tumble, falling down the grassy
slope. Her crown falls beneath one brother, is crushed.
Among her things, May picks up her half-embroidered cushion
(the one Maud finds a hundred years on) with verses only
begun. Ash turns away as --
HIS NOTE
without May even registering --
Flies from her hand, up into the air. Carried by the wind
like a leaf, it floats through the fields. Over the grass,
connected by diamond-threads of light --
Over the yellow and purple flowers, up into the branches of
a tree. When a wind blows, RUSTLING LEAVES, seeming to play
music upon them. HOLD ON the tree. SLOW PAN THROUGH TO --

END OF FLASHBACK.

EXT. LONDON LIBRARY (ST. JAMES'S SQUARE) - DAY

That same tree. <A hundred years later. Now full circle,
growing magically in an elegant square in central London.
As the WIND RUSHES through the branches, in an ancient
harmony --

About to pluck from its branches to tap upon a library
window --

Leaves, floating like birds.

FADE TO BLACK.
