to a CLOSHUP OF BARRY.

Driver
Tas town's only about eight hundred yards tons, se if youtre
going out to any one of the ranches I'll be glad to drop

We see that Barry is thinking hard. Beside his head,
out of focus, but in the forosround, is the end of the
extinguisher, Barry's face bagins to light up and the
screcn is flllcd with a veprise, superimnosed over

Barry's face. .

It-is the moment during the molee outside tho aircraft
factory when the contents of tha wallet fell on tho
ground co Barry picked them up. Over Barry's faco we
see, against the background of rimming feet, Rarry's
hand as it pisks up the envelope. It rushes to the
screen and ve soe the first line of the address, with
the namo "Frant: Fry," and in the bottom right-hand
corner, "Deep Springs Ranch, Bridgeport." :

On the sound track there is the faint sound of a
polica siren from belind them. Barry's face tightens.
The Griver automatically lets up on the gas.

Oh, oh - Santa Claus.

It wasn't the evidence. I could have argued with them

mother seered to think I was guilty -- I just couldn't take
it... And so I beat it.

Teddies looks at him calmly, disbelieving.

facing a tall, young man who is dancing with another
woman, whose age is about twenty-seven or twenty-eight.
She is a wallflower type.

With a deft movement, before Barry can realize what is
