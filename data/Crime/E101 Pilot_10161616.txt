INT. EPCOT THEATRE -- DAY 2

A MIRRORED BALL DESCENDS. Horns BLARE. Hips SHIMMY. Clumps of
students whip around in succession, beaming with optimism and
enthusiasm, painting rainbows of joy with their arms as they
roar through a DISCO MEDLEY. “Last Dance,” “That's The Way I
Like It,” "Disco Inferno” -- all the classics are covered.

Their dancing is youthful, the kids are overwhelmed with joy.

The choir hits its final position as they bleat "You Should
Be Dancing.” CLOSE on our NERVOUS YOUNG MAN near the back,
eyes open wide, partner in a dip: the world has just opened
up fo him.. SMASH TO BLACK. TITLE UP...

"GLEE"
INT... SCHUESTER APARTMENT -— DINNERTIME -- 2008 3
TIGHT on a HALF-EMPTY BOTTLE OF KRAFT LITE RANCH DRESSING.
WILL SCHUESTER -- thirty, naturally optimistic -- pours a

DOLLOP on his iceberg salad, then smiles at his wife TERRI
across the card table they use as a dining room.

WILL
How was work today?

TERRI
Quarterly reports came in this
morning -- our sales are up two

point three percent -- that's in
the top twenty of all of the Sheets
N’ Things in the state.

WILL
Wow.

TERRI
I‘m pretty sure moving the
Primaloft comforters out front made
the difference -- and we all know
whose decision that was.

They share a smile. Terri flips through a POTTERY BARN
CATALOGUE, carefully marking items she’s interested in with
COLOR CODED POST-IT FLAGS.

WILL
You're not going to buy any of that
stuff are you?

TERRI
Dreams are free.
 

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 3.

WILL

I wish you could have seen Glee
Club rehearsal yesterday, Terr.
The new number is going to take us
to nationals. I'm feeling it.

(then, sexy)
You know, the District pays for the
trip to Orlando, Maybe I could
convince them to let you tag along
as my “assistant.”

TERRI
Wow. Epcot. You don’t think they'd
put us up in the Grand Floridian do
you? The Polynesian's nice too.

WILL
I think they usually get us rooms
at the Motel Six. Maybe I could get
them to book us at the Floridian if
I offered to pay the difference?

TERRI
Sure, maybe we could trade in some
of your stock options. All I‘m
going to say is they're hiring at
HW Menken...

WILL
I’m not going back to accounting,
Terri. Remember what happened? The
fluorescent lights gave me rickets.

TERRI
All I remember is your paychecks
were twice as big. You were an
economics major in college, Will.

WILL
And when I tried it I was
miserable. I need something
more.,.creative.
(noticing the Post-Its)
Why does the lamp get a red one?

TERRI
Red is for accessories, yellow is
luxuries, green is for necessities,

Terri pours what's left of the DRESSING on her salad. Then,

pissed -~
 

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 4.

TERRI (CONT'D)
You need to get more when the
bottle is half-empty.

WILL
Or half-full.

TERRI
Doctor Musky said I have to start
relaxing if we want to conceive.
You know what she told us about the
shape of my uterus. I'm in charge
of two part-time employees. I don't
need the added stress of making
sure we have enough condiments at
home. Sometimes I think you care
more about those kids than you do
about me.

WILL.
Baby, no. You're right. I'll stock
up on everything tomorrow.

TERRI
Don’t go too crazy -- we need to
dip into the emergency fund, the
muffler fell off the car again.

She exits with her catalogue, leaving him alone at the table.
EXT. MCKINLEY HIGH ——- THE NEXT MORNING 4

TIGHT on the busted muffler, DRAGGING along the blacktop as
it pulls into a parking space. QUICK CUT: Will exits the car,
brown bag lunch in one hand, briefcase in the other, passes a
PACK OF JOCKS and a STUDENT -- KURT HUMMEL.

WILL
Making some new friends, Kurt?

PUCK, & MANCHTLD answers for him,

PUCK
Totally, Mr, Shue.

Will points at FINN HUDSON, a handsome jock who looks too
kind to he hanging out with the rest of the motley crew.

WILL
You still owe me that report on
“Que Hace in su verano pasado",
Finn.

(MORE)
 

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 5.

WILL (CONT'D)
(off Pinn‘'s confiision)
What you did last summer.

FINN
Almost half way done with almost
all of it, Mr. Shue.

He smiles at them and enters the school, feeling good about
his connection with the student body. As soon as he's gone,
Puck SCOOPS up Kurt and carries him towards a DUMPSTER.

KORT
Please —- this is from the Marc
Jacobs Grunge collection.

FINN
Wait.

He pulls Kurt down, then gently pulls off the scared
freshman's stylish jacket, folds it under his arm.

FINN (CONT'D)
Ok.

Puck picks up a jacketless Kurt, TOSSES him in the dumpster.
INT. MCKINLEY HIGH —- MORNING 5

Will walks the halls. Typical Midwest student body. A few
KIDS greet Will with an “hola.” He passes the school's TROPHY
CASE and stops. We PUSH IN on A FRAMED PICTURE OF MRS. ADLER:
“LILLIAN ADLER, 1937-1997," And then a quote: “By its very
definition, Glee is about opening yourself up to Joy.“

Next to the photo tribute: a LARGE TROPHY. PUSH IN on the
award, the engraving reads 1993 SHOW CHOIR CHAMPIONSHIPS,
ORLANDO FLORIDA —- WILLIAM MCKINLEY HIGH FIRST PLACE. The
trophy and all it represents HAUNTS Will.

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 6

FIND RACHEL BERRY, at the mirror, making herself up. Her
makeup is way too THEATRICAL, TWO CHEERLEADERS, SANTANA LOPEZ
and QUINN FABRAY, check her out, laugh cruelly.

QUINN FPABRAY
Getting ready for the tranny prom,
Rachel?

SANTANA
Get a stylist.

Rachel takes out her can of AQUA NET and unapologetically
sprays her hair -- HEAVILY, gassing the girls away.
“Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 6.

As soon as they're gone, Rachel takes herself in -- she's so
lonely. She pushes the feelings way down inside, regains her
determination and continues SPRAYING.

INT. WILL’S CLASSROOM —- DAY 7

The room is decorated with MAPS of MEXICO. Will is running a
full classroom of STUDENTS through the conjugation of the
verb “to be.” He spies the clock on the wall. RACK FOCUS to
the clock -—- 2:45. The BELL RINGS and everyone rushes out,

WILL
Hasta manana.

Will excitedly loosens his tie, grabs a pile of SHEET MUSIC
from his drawer and is out the door before the last student.

INT. CHOIR ROOM —- DAY 8

Mckinley High's Glee Club sings “Sit Down You're Rocking The
Boat.” It's not much of a choir. Just five kids, all
OUTCASTS. One, ARTY ABRAMS, is paralyzed from the waist down.
Arty belts out his solo. The song ENDS, everyone turns to
Will for guidance. Until --

RACHEL
We suck.

WILL
It will get there —- we just need
to keep rehearsing.

RACHEL
Mr. Schuester -- do you have any
idea how ridiculous it is to give
the lead solo in “Sit Down You're
Rocking the Boat” to a kid in a
wheelchair?

ARTY
i think Mr. Shue was using irony to
enhance the performance,

RACHEL
There‘s nothing ironic about show
choir!

She storms out. Slow PUSH IN on Will’s sad face as —

WILL (V.0.)
Rachel was right...we do suck. We
might have been the worst glee club
in the state.

(MORE)
 

10

“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 7.

WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I mean, really -- it's an
unbelievable story how we ended up
the way we did. T guess it all
started with Mrs. Adler's
replacement...Sandy Ryerson.

INT. AUDITORIUM -—— DAY -— FLASHBACK 3

SANDY RYERSON, 35, with highlights and a pastel sweater
thrown over his shoulders, coaches the kids. It's a mess. For
some reason, every member of the choir is holding a STOOL.

WILL (V.0.
Sandy loved props. In the span of
one year, McKinley became the
bottom feeders of the glee world —-
we were a "stool choir."

As the rehearsal continues, girls begin DISAPPEARING.
They’ze dropping out, so are some of the better boy dancers,

WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Years passed. Glee was no longer a
place where you went with dreams of
being a star, it was a haven for
outcasts.

Finally, everyone has disappeared eacept for Rachel, Kurt,
Arty, MERCEDES, TINA, who TWITCHES and HANK -- the last of
the “in crowd” still in Glee Club.

WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Slowly but surely, anybody who
could do a jumping jack defected to
McKinley High’s nationally ranked
cheerleading squad, Cheerios!

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -— DAY —- FLASHBACK 10.

Highschool Bitch Goddess Quinn Fabray forms the top of the
Cheerios! pyramid. Beads of sweat drop down their faces, An
over-tanned, ponytailed WOMAN stares at a stopwatch.

WILL (V.0.)

Led by Sue Sylvester, Cheerios! had
placed third at internationals in
Pyongyang and had twice appeared on
Fox Sports Net. There was a rumor
that Sue had posed for Penthouse
Magazine and took horse estrogen,
but that was only a rumor.

The stopwatch reads 23 minutes. The pyramid trembles.

SUE
(staring them down)
Don't disappoint me. Don‘t
disappoint me.

INT. CHOIR ROOM -- DAY -—- FLASHBACK iL

Hank leans on the baby grand holding his stool, nervous, as
Sandy, now 45 and still sporting highlights despite a bad
bald spot, enters, spraying breath spray in his mouth,

WILL (V.0.)
Glee Club languished, but still,
the school didn't care -- as long
as Sandy came in under budget. He
would probably still be teaching
today if he had been able to
control himself.

SANDY
This is a song about wanting
someone, Hank.

HANK
i don’t know, Mr. Ryerson. I mean,
this is kind of not cool anymore.

SANDY
Is that why you're here? To be
cool? Guess what, bud, stars aren’t
cool, they burn -- hot. Now sing.

Sandy starts playing the PIANO and Hank breaks into a

rendition of “Where Is Love?” from “Oliver!” When Hank gets
to the chorus, Sandy softly sings along with him, then takes
a hand off the keys and places it firmly on Hank's. ZOOM to
the closed glass doorway, revealing RACHEL, staring daggers.

INT. PRINCIPAL FIGGINS’ OFFICE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK 12

A CRYING Sandy, a SECURITY GUARD behind him, sits across from
a stern looking PRINCIPAL FIGGINS, 40s.

FIGGINS
My hands are tied, Sandy, We cannot
afford another lawsuit.

SANDY
But I’m not even gay!

As Sandy weeps gay tears -—

“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 3,

WILL (V.0.)
There was a vacancy, and fate
called on me to fill it.

INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE -- DAY --— FLASHBACK 13

Will goes to get coffee, but there’s no pot. He turns to his
buddy, KEN TANAKA, the history teacher/football coach.

WILL
Where's the coffee machine?

KEN TANAKA
Figgins got rid of it. Budget cuts.
I know for a fact they're still
getting hot java over at Carver. We
should strike.

Sue Sylvester enters with LATTES.

SUE
Hello boys. Who needs a pick me up?

KEN TANAKA
Wow, lattes!

EMMA PILLSBURY, the school guidance counselor, enters and
sits. Emma's pretty, but she doesn't think she is.

KEN TANAKA (CONT'D)

(flirty)
Hey Emma.
EMMA,
(not flirty)
Hey, Ken.

(then, trying to be cool)
Hey, Will. What's with the lattes?

SUE
I felt just awful about Principal
Figgins cutting the coffee budget
to pay for a nutritionist for rhe
Cheerios,

EMMA
I heard you guys were six hundred
dollars over budget on that.

Suz
Well, my performers didn’t get on
Fox Sport Net last year because
they ate at The Sizzler.
14

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 10.

EMMA
Since when are cheerleaders
performers?

Ken and Will share a look, this could get ugly. A long beat.

SUB
Your resentmént is delicious.

She smiles seductively at Emma, exits. Ken, wearing a latte
mustache, checks out Sue‘s ass as she goes.

Emma pulls a HANDY WIPE out of her purse, starts CLEANING the
table in front of her. Will watches as she meticulously
scrubs her place setting, then takes her own plastic
silverware, plate and cup out of her bag. She notices the
stares, smiles nervously hoping they won’t talk about her
OcD, then puts her LUNCH on her plate and starts eating.

KEN TANAKA
I didn’t see you at the singles
mixer last weekend, Emma.

EMMA
Oh, yeah, I didn’t go. A pipe
exploded in my building. It was
wild. Fire trucks, police. I think
it was on the local news. Did you
see it Will?

WILL
Sure, maybe.

EMMA
I hate those mixers, anyway. Just
a big meat market. I gave one of
the firemen my phone number, but he
hasn't called yet.

Eye contact. Tanaka notices chemistry there. Then --

EMMA (CONT'D)
Hey, did you hear they fired Sandy

Ryerson?
WILL
Really? Who's going to take over
Glee Club?
INT. PRINCIPAL FIGGINS’ OFFICE -- DAY ~~ FLASHBACK 14
WILL

I’d like to take over Glee Club.

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 ll.

FPIGGINS
You want to captain the Titanic,
too?

WILL

I think I can make it great again.
There’s no joy in these kids. They
feel invisible. That's why every
ne of them has a Myspace page.

FIGGINS
Sixty bucks a month. That's what I
need to keep the program up.

WILL
And you expect me to pay it?

FIGGINS
I'm certainly not going to. We’re
not talking about The Cheerios
here, Will, They were on Fox Sports
Net last year. When Glee Club
starts bringing that kind of
prestige to the school again, you
can have all the money you want.
Until then, sixty a month -- and
you've got to use the costumes and
props we already have. Oh, but we
need the stools for wood shop.

INT. SCHUESTER BEDROOM -- THE MIDDLE OF THAT NIGHT 15

Will stares up at the ceiling. Terri is next to him, taking
up the whole bed, he's just got a sliver of space,

WILL (V.0.)
Hiding the sixty dollars a month
from Terri was going to be hard.
But I had a bigger problem. How was
I going to get these kids
motivated? One thing I knew for
sure, we needed a new name. Sandy's
“Rhythm Explosion” didn’t cut it.

Will pops up in bed, eyes wide with excitement -- he has it.
INT. MCKINLEY HIGH -- HALLWAY -- DAY — PLASHBACK 16

Will pins up a SIGN UP SHEET to reveal the NAME printed in
bold letters -- “SIGN UP HERE FOR “NEW DIRECTIONS!” QUICK
CUTS: Shyly, Arty, Kurt, Mercedes and Tina sign in, then
exit, hoping no one picks on them. Finally Rachel proudly
bounces to the sheet, and begins to sign in as we hear —-

RACHEL ‘S VOICE
Hi. My name’s Rachel Berry, and
I'll be singing “On My Own” from
the seminal Broadway classic "Les
Miz.”

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY -- FLASHBACK 17
Will smiles from his audition perch.

WILL
Fantastic. Let’s hear it.

She begins to sing in the spotlight. The song continues over:
INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY —- FLASEBACK 18

Rachel finishes writing her name. After it, she draws a big,
cartoon STAR.

RACHEL (V.0.)

You might laugh because every time
I sign my name I put a gold star
after it. But it’s a metaphor, and
metaphors are important. My gold
stars are a metaphor for me being a
star.

She turns around, very self-satisfied. Puck throws a Big Gulp
at her head, drenching her.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -—- DAY -- FLASHBACK 19
Rachel speed walks down the hall, on a mission,

RACHEL (V.0.)
And just so we're clear, I want to
clear up that hateful rumor that TI
was the one who turned Sandy
Ryerson in because he gaye Hank
Saunders the solo I deserved.
That's horsepucky.

INT. PRINCIPAL FIGGINS’ OFFICE —- DAY -- FLASHBACK 20
Rachel sits across from Figgins, crying melodramatically.
RACHEL
«..and he was touching Hank,
caressing him...it was so wrong!

Principal Figgins, upset growing, hands her a Kleenex.

I am NOT homophobic. In fact, TI
have two gay dads.

INT. MCKINLEY HIGH -- DAY —— FLASHBACK 21
Rachel is at her locker.

RACHEL (V.0.)
See, I was born ont of love.

The locker door slams back revealing a FAMILY PORTRAIT of
RACHEL between her TWO DADS, one black and one Jewish.

RACHEL (V.0.) (CONT’D)
My two dads screened potential
surrogates based on beauty and IQ.
Then they mixed their sperm
together and used a turkey baster.
To this day, we don’t know which
one is my real dad, which I think
is pretty amazing.

The locker door slams shut taking us ta --
INT. DANCE CLASS —- DAY -~ PLASHBACK 22

PANNING A ROW OF LITTLE GIRLS, trying to tap. They are sweet
and untalented.

RACHEL (V.0.)

My dads spoiled me in the arts, I
was given dance lessons, vocal
lessons.,..anything to give me a
competitive edge.

REVEAL Little Rachel at the end, grinning manically and tap
dancing like a fiend.

INT. RACHEL’S ROOM -- DAY —- FLASHBACK 23
Rachel is at her computer.
RACHEL (V.0.)
You might think that all the boys
at school would totally want to tap
this, but my MySpace schedule keeps
me way too busy to date.

She types vigorously.

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 14,

RACHEL (V.O,) (CONT'D)
I try to post a MySpace video every
day, just to keep my talent alive
and growing.

WHIP PAN to reveal Rachel, still singing “On My Own.”

RACHEL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Nowadays, being anonymous is worse
than being peor, Fame is the most
important thing in our culture now.

INT. SCHOOL GYM -—— DAY 24

Quinn, Santana and the cheerleaders are huddled over a laptop
with wireless, dying laughing at Rachel’s MySpace entry.

RACHEL (V-0.)
And if there's one thing I've
learned, it's that no one is gonna
just hand it to you.

INT, RACHEL'S ROOM —- DAY —- FLASHBACK 25

Back to the computer. Rachel, biting her lip, scrolls through
her feedback, all nasty notes from The Cheerios.

“Why don't you die already?” “Your videos make me want to
kill my entire family.” “Please get sterilized.” Rachel is
hurt. We stay on her as the last mournful notes of “On My
Own” reverberate,

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY -—- FLASHBACK 26
Rachel has just finished.
RACHEL
Thanks so much, I enjoyed
performing for you.
WILL
(moved by her talent)
Very nice Rachel.

RACHEL
When do we start rehearsals?

INT. AUDITORIUM —- THE NEXT DAY 27
TIGHT, at ground level, on a pair of Hush Puppy covered FEET.

PAN UP to reveal Will, singing “Sit Down” as he patiently
demonstrates some choreography to the glee club.

“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 15,

SHIMMY, SHUFFLE STEP, HOP -- he’s good. The kids are another
matter. They‘re in costume.

WILL
Pretty simple stuff -- any
questions?

MERCEDES
I’m not wearing this,

WILL
Those costumes are good luck. The
“93 team took nationals wearing
them.

MERCEDES
I know -- I can still smell them.
Whoever wore this dress before me
clearly had the stink ass. I want a
new costume.

WILL
I'll take it to the dry cleaners
for you.

MERCEDES

You can take it to the moon, baby —
everyone knows you can’t get stink
ass out of polyester.

Rachel shakes her head, unable to hide her frustration.
MERCEDES (CONT‘D)
You want to be startin’ somethin’,
Britney?
Staredown, until Rachel breaks and storms out.
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- DAY 28

The Cheerios are running through a routine. They could open
the Olympics. They finish, breathing hard, hoping for praise.

SUE
That's sloppy! You're sloppy
babies!

They wilt. PAN UP, to find Rachel, sitting high up in the
Stands. She stares down longingly at The Cheerios...the
popular ones. REVEAL Will climbing up. He sits next to her.
 

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 16.

WILL
You’re the best kid in there,
Rachel -- but that comes with a

price. The other kids are looking
to you for guidance. You've got to
be more optimistic.

RACHEL
You sound like my dads -- “power of
positive thinking” and all of that.
I know I'm just a sophomore but I
ean feel the clock ticking away. Tf
don't want to leave high school
with nothing to show for it.

WILL
You get great grades, you're 24
fantastic singer...

RACHEL
Everybody hates me.

WILL
And you think Glee Club is going ta
change that?

RACHEL
Being great at something is going
to change it. Being part of
something special...makes you
special. Right?

WILL.

What if I give you all the solos?
RACHEL

Glee club isn’t about solos -- it's

about duets, it's a team sport. I
need a male lead who can keep up
with me vocally. -—

WILL
Maybe if I tutor Arty a little...

RACHEL
Look, Mr. Shue, I really appreciate
what you're trying to do, but if
you can’t get me what I need, I'm
sorry...I'm not going to make a
fool of myself. I can’t keep
wasting my time with Glee -- it
hurts too much.
“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/06 17.

Will ponders his next move when A WHISTLE BLASTS.

KEN TANAKA
Schuester! Figgins wants you.
29 INT. PRINCIPAL FIGGINS’ OFFICE -- DAY 29
WILL

But we just started rehearsals.

FIGGINS
My hands are tied, Shue, I need the
auditorium. Alcoholics Anonymous
wants to rent it out for their
afternoon meetings. Lots of drunks
in this town, and they're paying me
ten bucks a head.

WILL
Give me two months. If we show at
Regionals, Glee stays, if not the
bar's open in the auditorium.

FIGGINS
What is it with you and this club,
Will? I like to see passion in my
teachers, but this is bordering on
obsession. It's time to let it go,
You've only got five kids -- one of
them’s a cripple.

WILL
Then I guess you've got nothing to
worry about,

FIGGINS
Fine, two months -- but you're

running detention for free to make
it up to me.

WILL
Deal.

Off Will, having no idea how he’s going to pull this off -—

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
30 INT. SHEETS N’ THINGS -— DAY 30
Terri is showing HOWARD how to fold a FITTED SHEET.

TERRI
You've got to stick your hands in
the corners like this, see?

HOWARD.
I can‘t do it. I'm dyslexic. Maybe
I should just stick to towels and
washcloths.

TERRI
If you can't fold a fitted sheet
you can’t work at Sheets N’ Things,
Howard.

INTERCOM VOICE
Associate to returns.

TERRI
Make sure they have a receipt.

Howard slinks off as Will arrives. Terri smiles.

TERRI (CONT'D)
To what do I owe this pleasure?

He goes to kiss her, she pulls away, makes sure no one saw.

TERRI (CONT'D)
Not at work.

Will hides his hurt and holds up a deli bag.

WILL
We've been fighting 50 much I just
thought I’d bring you a peace
offering. Roast beef on
pumpernickel -- your favorite.

TERRI
Is this mayo? If my diabetes comes
back I can't get pregnant. What do
you want, Will? I know you --
something's up.

WILL
T just wanted to tell you that I
have to start working late for the
next couple of months.

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 19.

WILL (CONT'D)
I'm monitoring after-school
detention. I made a deal with
Figgins so he wouldn't kill Glee
Club.

TERRI
I‘m on my feet six hours 4 day
here, then you want me to come home
and cook dinner for myself?

WILL
Things are a little hard at school
right now. I guess I just wanted ta
come by to talk to you about it.

Before Terri can respond, Howard returns.

HOWARD
This lady wants to return these
sheets, but something tells me
we've got another bedwetter.

He holds up the sheet -- there's a HUGE STAIN in the middle.

TERRI
We'll talk about it over dinner,
okay?

Will smiles, nods as they exit. Suddenly, as he goes to
leave, he hears a FAMILIAR VOICE coming from the aisle.

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
And two-hundred is the highest
thread count you have?

Will peeks through a display to see Sandy Ryerson talking to
a STOCK BOY. Will tries to sneak out, but --

SANDY
William?

WILL
(faking it)
Sandy. Hey!

SANDY
Well hello. How are things? I hear
you took over Glee Club,

WILL
Yeah, I hope you're not too upset.

SANDY
Are you kidding? Getting out of
that swirling eddy of despair was
the best thing that ever happened
to me. Don’t get mé wrong, it
wasn’t easy at first. I mean, being
dismissed for what I was accused
of? My long distance girlfriend in
Cleveland nearly broke up with me.
Tt’s taken me weeks to get over my
nervous breakdown.

WILL

Did they put you on medication?
SANDY

Better -- medical marijuana. It’s

genius. And as long as I tell my
Doctor Feelgood that I can’t sleep,
I can get as much as I want. I’ve
found the system to be quite
lucrative.

WILL
You're a drug dealer?

SANDY
I make five times more than I did
teaching. I keep some for myself
and take money baths with the rest.

WILL
But who do you sell it to?

EXT. MCKINLEY HIGH -- UNDER BLEACHERS —- DAY -— FLASHBACK 31

Sandy hands a BAGGY of weed to KEN TANAKA, who gladly pays
him while looking over his shoulder.

INT. SHEETS N' THINGS -- PRESENT DAY 32

SANDY
You want in?

WILL
No -— I mean I tried it once in
college, but you know, Terri and I
are trying to get pregnant.

Sandy tries to STUFF a bag of weed in Willi’s blazer jacket.

SANDY

Take it -- I do the packaging
myself, and the first sample's
free. You're coaching those tone
deaf spazoases, you're going to
need it.

(flirty)
Cail me.

Will, head down, sneaks out of the store.
INT. SUE SYLVESTER'’S OFFICE -- DAY 33

TIGHT on a bottle of PLEDGE SPRAYED on an already glistening
TROPHY. Sue's polishing one of her many prizes. There’s a
knock, Will enters.

WILL
Hey, Sue. Can I have a sec?

Sue‘s face contorts. Will is the enemy. As soon as she
spins around, though, a huge smile splays across her face.

SUE
Sure, buddy. Come on in.

EXT. BREEZEWAY — DAY 34

Emma) \mdves quickly down the breezeway, steps straight into a
WAD OF GOOEY CHEWING GUM. She starts to panic, sits down on a
bench, looks at the gum, can’t touch it. Will shows up.

WILL
Hey, Emma, can I have a sec?
(then)
What is that, gum?

EXT. TRACK -— DAY 35
Ken jogs around the track. Will jogs up next to him.
KEN
Hey, dude. You got cholesterol

problems too? My doctor said start
running or give up Hometown Buffet.

WILL
I actually needed your help with
something.
INT. SUE SYLVESTER'S OFFICE --— DAY 36

Theyre sitting now. Sue fights to suppress evil laughter.
 

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 22.

SUE
You want to talk to my Cheerios
about joining Glee Club?

WILL
I need more kids, performers —- and
all of the best ones are in the
Cheerios. I figured that some of
them might want to double up.

SUE
Ok, so what you're doing right now
is called “blurring the lines.”
High school is a caste system. Kids
fall into certain slots -- the
jocks and the popular kids up in
the penthouse, the invisibles and
the ones who play World of Warcraft
on the bottom floor,

WILL
Where do the glee kids lie?

SUE
Sub-basement.

37 EXT. BREEZEWAY -- DAY 37

Emma's on a bench, her foot up in Will's face as he SCRAPES
the gum off the bottom of her shoe with a CREDIT CARD.

EMMA
Sue’s not wrong -- but I don’t
think anything is set in stone.
Kids do what they think is cool,
which is not always who they are.
You just need to find a way to get
them out of their boxes.

WILL
How do I do that?

EMMA
They follow the leader. Get a
couple of the popular kids to sign
up and the rest will fall in line.

34 EXT. TRACK —- DAY 38

WILL
dust let me talk to them.

KEN
I don’t know, dude. I can’t imagine
any of my guys wanting to join Glee
Club. Last month they held down one
of their teammates and shaved off
his eyebrows because they found out
he watched Grey's Anatomy.

WILL
All i‘m asking for is an
introduction.

KEN
Fine -— but you've got to put in a

good word for me with Emma.
EXT. BREEZEWAY —- DAY 39
Will finishes cleaning Emma's shoe.

WILL
There you go, Cinderella.

EMMA
Thanks, Will. I have trouble with
stuff like that. Messy things.

They share a smile. He knows. A beat, then --

EMMA (CONT'D)
It's nice, how much you care about
Glee, about those kids.

INT. SUE SYLVESTER’S OFFICE -— DAY 40

SUE
Tf you really care about them,
you'll leave well enough alone,
Children like to know where they
stand. Let your glee kids have
their little club, but don’t
pretend that any of them are
something they're not,

Off Will, realizing Sue’s an obstacle he will always have to
go around, we CUT TO:

INT, LOCKER ROOM -- THE NEXT DAY 41

The FOOTBALL TEAM is changing. Ken BLOWS HIS WHISTLE,
 

 

“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 24.

KEN TANAKA
Circle up. Mr. Schuester is going
to talk to you. You don’t listen,
you do laps, you mouth off, you do
laps.

Will takes center stage. He’s endearingly nervous,

WILL
Hey, guys. I think I know most of
you from Spanish class, but I
wanted to talk to you about
something else -- music. Who are
some of your favorite musicians?

pucK
Lil’ Wayne,

qocK #1
Usher.

WILL

Great. All of those guys started
somewhere, right? I’m here to offer
you guys a chance to be like your
heroes, get up on stage.

ANGLE ON Finn...silently riveted...inspired even. But he is
too afraid of peer pressure to show it.

WILL (CONT‘D)
Glee Club needs guys.

The guys look at each other -~- is this dude serious? Then --

PUCK
I can sing.

WILL
Really? That’s fantastic.

PUCK
Wanna hear?

He gets up and stands next to Will. He closes his eyes as if
about to sing, then PARTS. The crowd goes wild. Puck FLEXES
his biceps. Ken glares at him and MOUTHS "Laps."

WILL.
I’m going to hang a sign-up sheet
by the door to the locker room for
anybody that's interested.

43

“Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 25.

The guys grumble. Ken SLOWS HIS WHISTLE again.

KEN TANAKA
Dismissed.

They disperse. Will looks into Ken's eyes.

WILL
You been sleeping okay? Your eyes
look bloodshot.

Ken shrugs. As soon as Will's gone though, a PARANOID Ken
pulls out a tiny bottle of VISINE and drops some in his eyes.

INT. LOCKER ROOM -- TWO DAYS LATER 42

Will, filled with hope, walks up to the New Directions! sign-
up Sheet. People have signed up! The sheet reads: “Gaylord
Weiner.” “Butt Lunch.” “Dick Taco.” A few lines down, just
“Penis,” Will deflates. PUSH IN on his despair as -—

WILL (V.0.)
I honestly thought that was the end
of the very brief fever-dream that
was New Directions!

He hears something...an echoing voice from the locker room
singing REQ Speedwagon’s “Can't Fight this Feeling.” Will
follows it.

INT. LOCKER ROOM —- CONTINUOUS 43

Someone is alone in the showers. Will stands listening,
hidden in the shadows.

VOICE (0.5S.)
“And even as I wander/I'm keeping
you in sight..."

It's FINN HUDSON. Will is wildly impressed.

WILL (V.0.)
I suddenly realized why I had
wanted to do this thing in the
first place,...it was seeing a gift
in 2 kid that they didn’t even know
they had, It was pure talent.

Will’s eyes widen. Something occurs to him.

WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
What I did then was the blackest
moment of my Life.

(MORE )
“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 26.

WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
It was worse than when I ran over
Terri's yippy dog on prom night.
And like then, what happened next
was Messy and no accident.

44 INT. WILL'S EMPTY SPANISH CLASS -- DAY 44
Will coolly slides Sandy's bag of marijuana across the desk,

WILL
Wanna tell me how long you've had a
drug problem?

REVEAL Finn, across from him. Really about to lose it.

WILL (CONT'D)
Look, if it were up to me, we
wouldn't have mandatory bi-weekly
afternoon locker checks...

FINN
But I’ve never seen that before,
Mr. Shue! T swear! It isn’t MINE!
I‘ll pee in a cup!

A beat. Will is momentarily stymied by this, then —~

WILL
It wouldn’t make any difference,
possession is eight-tenths of the
law. I'm pretty sure this much pot
is a felony. You’ll get kicked ont
of school, lose your football
scholarship...

FINN
Wait, I was gonna get a
scholarship? To where?

No idea. A beat. Struggling, getting back on track --

WILL
You could land in prison, son.

FINN
Oh my God. What is my mom gonna
say?!? Please don’t tell my mom...

“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 27,

WILL
I see a lot of myself in you, I
know what it’s like to struggle to
make good life choices, and I don't
want to see you throw away
everything you have to offer the
world. I just expected more cut of
you, Finn.

FINN looks up, destroyed.

FINN (V.0.)

That really got to me, when Mr.
Schuester said that. Because every
day of my life, I expect more out
of myself. See, I might look
confident and everything? But I
really struggle with the same thing
others kids do...peer pressure,
bacne...

EXT. FINN'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON -—- FLASHBACK 45

A rundown split-level with a brown, patchy lawn. Ten-year-old
Pinn and his MOM, CAROLE, bring in groceries from a Honda.

FINN (V.0.)
I never knew my dad. He died in
Iraq when we were fighting Osama
bin Laden the first time.

INT. FINN'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON —- FLASHBACK 46

QUICK CUTS: young Finn puts away the groceries, upset as his
mother battles a bill collector on their rotary wall—phone.

FINN (V.0.)
My mom and me, we're real close.
But being a single parent can be
hard. The only good time for Mom
was when we splurged a littie bit
and ordered Emerald Dreams.

HEAR the doorbell ring as --
INT. PINN'S ROUSE —- DAY -- FLASHBACK 47

EXT. FINN’S ROUSE —- DAY -— FLASHBACK 48

Carole'’s in a lawnchair, watching as Darren teaches young
Finn how to apply Emerald Dreams. As the green paint sprays
across the lawn, Darren sings along to Journey's “Lovin’‘
Touchin" Squeezin” which blares from a boombox.

FINN (V.0.)
That was the first time I really
heard music.

Young Finn sings along.

DARREN
You gotta voice, buddy. Seriously.
T£ I had your voice, my band would
still be together. Stick with it.

EXT. PINN’S HOUSE —- DAY -- FLASHBACK 49

Young Finn plays football with himself on the now beautiful,
green front lawn, throwing the ball across the yard and
running to try to catch it, as Carole sits despondent on the
stoop, staring into the distance.

FINN (V.0.)
My mom took it real hard when
Darren left her for that girl he
met at Sam’s Club.

The EMERALD DREAMS truck passes, blasting Journey, a cute
BLONDE GIRL inside. Carole grabs, the, ball away, runs after
the truck and whips the football at, it. It thumps against the
back of the truck, which keeps driving. She remains standing
in the road, crying, destroyed. PUSH into Young Finn's
reaction.

FINN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
It was at that moment I decided to
do whatever it took to make my mom
proud of me...make her feel all her
sacrifice was worth it.

INT. WILL’S CLASSROOM -- DAY 50

We're back at the weed accusation. ANGLE: tears roll down
Finn's cheeks. Will feels awful.
 

51

“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 29.

WILL
Look. We have two options. I’m
running detention now, so you can
do six weeks after school...but
that'll be on your permanent
record.

FINN
What's the other option, Mr. Shue?

INT. AUDITORIUM —- DAY 51

MOVE down a line of SNAPPING FINGERS. The Club is lined up
on stage, snapping, tapping their feet and singing the “ba-
dum, ba-da-da-da-dums" from the top of “Summer Lovin'.”
Rachel stands nearby, confident, head bopping to the beat.

FINN
Summer lovin', happened so fast.

RACHEL
Summer lovin’, had me a blast.

FINN
Met a girl, crazy for me,

Rachel tosses down her sheet music and SASHAYS towards Finn,

RACHEL
Met a boy, cute as can be.

They're looking at each other, she's in love, he’s taken
aback by her enthusiasm. The CHORUS kicks in and the whole
gang performs a couple of verses. PUSH IN on Will..,riveted.

is i i After a lyric or two, the group stops, looks
to Will for direction, Before he can speak --

MERCEDES
Hold up, I'm not down with this
background singing nonsense. I'm
Beyonce, I ain’t no Kelly Rowland,

WILL
It's just one song, Mercedes.

KURT
And it was the first time we have
ever been good.

The rest of the crew agrees. Even Mercedes has to agree.

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 30.

MERCEDES
Ok, you're good white boy, I‘1l
give you that.

Rachel smiles up at him, totally smitten. Finn doesn’t know
what to make of any of this, he is completely bewildered.
Will doesn't care about any of the drama. He just sees, for
the first time, a glimmer of hope,

INT. TERRI'S CRAFT ROOM -- NIGHT 52

Half-finished craft projects EVERYWHERE: raggedy straw
wreaths, a wan-looking gingerbread house, the Pilgrims first
Thanksgiving in macaroni. Will and Terri silently pot
together an AMERICAN GOTHIC JIGSAW PUZZLE.

WILL
You usually don't let me in your
craft room.

TERRI
Isn't this fun? And challenging!
Every Wednesday we'll have pugzle
night. I know how important it is
for you to have a creative outlet.

Terri smiles sweetly, making the effort. A long beat.

WILL
The kids have been working so Hard.
I was thinking about taking them on
a field trip next Saturday. Carmel
High's performing a showcase ‘down
in Akron. Carmel’s going to be the
team to beat at Regionals. I
thought you might want to come
chaperone it with me.

TERRI
Saturday? I can‘t, Will. We're
living paycheck to paycheck. I had
to pick up an extra shift at work.

WILL
How much of that paycheck goes to
your Pottery Barn credit card?

TRERRT

I don’t know what youre talking
about.

He gets up, walks towards the closet.
 

“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 31.

Don't go in the Christmas closet.

He opens it up, it is filled to the brim with Pottery Barn.

Strangely,

WILL (CONT'D)
We can’t afford this stuff, Terri.

TERRI
But we could, Will. I’m a shoo-in
to be promoted during the Christmas
rush at Sheets ‘'N Things, I reek of
management potential. And they're
still hiring at H.W. Menken, it's
not too late...

WILL
My passion is teaching, Terri, for
the last time I don’t want to be an
accountant.

TERRI
Dr. Phil says people can change.
(welling up)
I'm not wrong for wanting a real
life, Will. It's hard not having
the things you need.

WILL
We need three mahogany toilet brush
holders?

TERRI
They're Balinese! It’s not a bad
thing to want more for yourself.
You said you needed an outlet. Weil
this is mine. Pottery Barn is my
Glee Club.

TERRI (CONT'D)

Will PINS up a CHAPERONE SIGN UP SHEET. Emma secretly watches
him from a table occupied by TWO OTHER TEACHERS. As soon as
he's gone, she heads for the sheets, checks it out.

CLEAN the PEN hanging from the sign and volunteers her

services. She looks at her name on the sheet and smiles,

Puck nods empathetically.

Loge tickets.

EMMA
No thanks, not my thing.

KEN TANAKA
Truckzilla ys. Truckasaurus. And

Emma pauses, wanting to be kind. Then with a deep breath —

EMMA.
Ken, you know how every time you
ask me out T tell you I’m on my
period?

KEN TANAKA
Which doesn’t bother me.

EMMA
Or I say I'm suffering from cluster
headaches? Or how I’m allergic to
nighttime? None of those things are
true. I’m just not interested in
dating you.

KEN TANAKA
What do I have to da...to get your
fine behind in my Scion?

EMMA
Fine Ken, make me say it -- I like
somebody else, okay? There’s
nothing I can do about it, he’s not
even available, it’s just something
I have to deal with.

Ken suddenly realizes who they're talking about. Hurt, he
turns to go, then comes back, LICKS HIS HAND and SMEARS IT on

Those hotdogs look like they’ve

EMMA
You want to go halvsies on a PBJ?

WILL
That sounds: perfect.

She reaches into her purse, puts on a PAIR OF RUBBER GLOVES
then pulls a sandwich oyt of a CAREFULLY WRAPPED sheet of TIN
FOIL before Handing half to Will. As they walk away, he
grins then takes 4 bite.

WILL (CONT'D)
I haven’t had one of these in a

long time -- my wife is allergic to

EMMA
That's sweet of you —- not eating

something because she can’t. How
long have you guys been married?
“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08

WILL
Five years last March -- but we've
been together since highschool. She
was my first girlfriend, actually.

EMMA
Wow. Love at first sight.

WILL
For me it was. You know when I
really knew she was the one? I
failed my trig final senior year
and she literally covered my car
with those little smiley face
stickers. There must have been ten
thousand of them.

(then, wistful)

I drove that Geo until every one of
them fell off.

Emma smiles, somewhat disappointed -- how could she possibly

compete with this superwoman.

WILL (CONT'D)
She used to be filled with so much
joy. Like this ray of sunshine.

EMMA.
And now?

WILL
You don’t want to hear about my
marital problens.

EMMA

No, I do. IT mean, people tend to
like to talk to me...I’m a guidance

counselor.

WILL
Okay, here’s the thing. Terri rides
me -- hard -- and I’ve always

appreciated it. I figure she just
wants me to be better. Lately
though I keep asking myself, better
at what? Making money? Being
upwardly mobile? I love her, but
we've...grown apart. We’ve just got
to get back on the same page...

INT. CARMEL HIGH AUDITORIUM —- AKRON —- DAY 61

State of the art and PACKED. PAN DOWN to reveai ail the
Mckinley High Glee Clubbers, reading programs, a little
nervous. Will picks up on this, leans in to address the row.

WILL
Okay, now I’ve heard these guys ere
pretty good, but I honestly don't
think they’ve got the talent we've
got. But let’s be a good audience,
guys, give ‘em some of thet ol’
McKinley High respect.

Emma smiles shyly, Will is a great teacher. Suddenly, the
lights go down and the audience erupts with anticipation.
Lights start whizzing around as an announcer bellows:

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen...welcome to
the Carmel High Fall Invitational
Showcase. We’d like to remind you
that video-recording and flash
photography is prohibited.

The curtain rises and the Carmel High Glee Club is revealed
with their backs to the audience, they are wearing
stunningly beautiful couture dresses and black tuxes. The
Mckinley High Glee Clubbers share a worried look -- by
costume comparison, they look like homeless people.

ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
AND NOW...let’s give a warm Buckeye
State welcome to last year’s
regional champions...Vocal
Adrenaline!

And the show begins. Vocal Adrenaline begins to roar through
“Rehab,” the guick-paced Amy Winehouse number.

VOCAL ADRENALINE
“They tried to make me go to Rehab,
I said “No, No, No..."

They look like they've been doing this for years. All these
kids could be on Broadway. Rachel's eyes are saucers. This is
the most amazing thing she’s ever seen.

The group splits in two, and the guys come down to the
center. THREE MIRRORED PANELS turn around from the back of
the stage, revealing THREE HORN PLAYERS, who blast the
trumpet part as the rest of the band pulls away,
A6l

“Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 39,

The crowd is now losing it. Some kids in the audience are
standing, Vocal Adrenaline has groupies, they are trying to
scream above the tidal wave of pitch-perfect sound.

Now the whole choir is moving, formation after stunning
formation, the kids are haying the time of their life,
possessed by the disease known as “show face.”

Finn cannot believe what he’s looking at. Kurt is near tears.
Mercedes shakes her head back and forth in horror.

The big finish now. Suddenly, two male Adrenaline members
start executing Olympic-worthy BACKFLIPS ACROSS THE STAGE.

Vocal Adrenaline hits their final position. Sweaty, panting,
looks of complete ecstasy on their faces, they know they are
special. A moment of silence, then the audience leaps to its
feet in a deafening ovation.

Only the New Directions remain in their seats. Will looks
ashen, Emma looks sick to her stomach. PUSH IN ON Tina, who
through her stutter finally says something.

TINA
We're d-d-d-d-d-doomed.

HEAR a STEEL DRUM VERSION OF "Don’t Worry Be Happy.”
ExT. SCHOOL, -—- DAY (LATER) AG1

The song continues as a dejected Finn heads across campus
toward his car. Suddenly, we realize the source of the music
as Finn passes TRE STEEL DRUM CLUB, practicing the song in
the courtyerd.

Pinn walks on, turns a corner and STOPS. There is Puck with
his. football posse, aiming PAINTBALL GUNS at him. Finn turns
around, but there are jocks behind him now too with guns.
He's encircled.

PUCK
Chicks don't have prostates. I
looked it up.

Bll the boys COCK their guns.

PUCK (CONT'D)
You broke the rules, Finn. I don’t
know what they are exactly, but by
hanging out with those Glee
rejects, you broke a big one. And
for that, you must be punished.

Suddenly, Finn is belted by paintballs, on his chest on his
back. HIGH ANGLE, down: it’s like Sonny Corleone in “The
Godfather."

62 INT. SCHUESTER APARTMENT —- LATE AFTERNOON -- LATER 62

A wary Will enters to find a CONGRATULATIONS BANNER draped in
the ENTRY WAY. Terri skips out of the kitchen, two PLASTIC
FLUTES of what appear to be CHAMPAGNE in her hands.

TERRI
There's my baby!

WILL
Wow, honey, this is amazing.
But...what's the congratulations
for? The kids haven't won anything
yet.

TERRI
(with quiet emotion)
I'm pregnant, Will.

Will needs a moment -- really? He's OVERWHELMED.
WILL.
Oh my God, Ter, this is it -- we’re
going to become...a family.

Terri nods sweetly, tears of joy in her eyes, He reaches for
her with emotion, she falls into his arms,

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 40.

CU on her face...hoping this is enough to get them over the
hump of their rocky marriage, hoping they can make it.

cU on his face..shis joy has given way to reality. It’s time
to grow up. There's someone coming that's more important than
his dreams now.

INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM —- DAY 63
The kids are absolutely SHOCKED. Then —-

ARTY
You‘re leaving us? When?

Reveal Will, addressing them.

WILL
I*ve given my two weeks notice. I
promise I‘1ll find a replacement
before I go.

MERCEDES.
Ts this ‘cause those Carmel kids
were so good? Because we can work
harder.

RACHEL
This isn't fair, Mr. Schvester -—-
we can't do this without you.

FINN
Does this mean I don’t have to be
in this club anymore?

Will is s0 moved, this is harder than he thought it would be.

WILL

This isn't about you guys. Being an
adult is about having to make
difficult choices. It's not like
high school, sometimes you have to
give up the things that you love.
One day you guys are going to grow
up and understand that.

(then, with emotion)
I have loved being your teacher.

This doesn’t matter to them -- all they understand is that

they're losing the one person at this school who believed in
them —- and Will knows it. He exits as we ——

ACT FOUR
INT. AUDITORIUM -- AFTERNOON 64

Dark and deserted. Will is on stage, packing up some sheet
music from a lectern into. his battered briefcase.

He goes to leave, stops in the middle of the stage, looks out
at the empty seats. This is the last time he‘ll be here. 360
REVOLVE AROUND HIM. He smiles softly, remembering his youth,
his dreams. He starts to exit. Suddenly, as he does --

THOOMP. A single hot SPOTLIGHT turns on, aimed at the place
he was just standing. It’s eerie, strange.

Will stares at the spotlight, a place that once gave him such
strength. Slowly, he moves toward it with purpose. He picks
up his guitar and begins to play Peter, Paul and Mary's
“Leaving on a Jet Plane”. Standing in the spotlight he starts
to sing. He looks out at the house, magnetic, moved.

WILL
"All my bags are packed, I'm ready
to go. I'm standing here outside
your door. I hate to wake you up to
Say goodbye. But the dawn is
breakin', it's early morn. The
taxi's waiting, he’s blowing his
horn. Already I'm so lonesome I
could cry.."

INTERCUT WITH:
EXT. SCHOOL COMMONS -- DAY 65

PUSH IN on a wide view of Emma, back to us, sitting at a
table. We come around, reveal she’s looking at last year’s
Mckinley High yearbook. A picture of Will, smiling dreamily
at her. She takes a Sharpie, draws a heart around it.

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY 66
The song continues. Will belts it out, confidence growing.

WILL
“So kiss me and smile for me. Tell
me that you'll wait for me. Hold me
like you'll never let me go. I’m
leavin on a jet plane. I don't know
when I'll be back again. Oh, babe,
I hate to go."

INT. DETENTION -— DAY 67
SLOW SOAR OVER the tables, filled with the odd student doing
time. FIND Will at his station, filling out an application.
REVEAL it's for a position at H.W. Menken. As he sadly writes
down his information -—
INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE -- DAY 68
A group of TEACHERS gossip. The camera glides by them --
BARB, A HOME-EC TEACHER

I heard he’s having a baby, that’s

why he gave Figgins his notice.
-~ to find Emma, overhearing this. Shattered in many ways.
INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY 69

Will continues to sing, pounding his boots in beat with the
rhythm as ——

INT. HALLWAY -- DAY ; 70
-— Emma races down the empty corridor ora mission as ——
INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY 71
Will finishes the number. It was the performance of his
life...that no one heard. The curtain behind him is closed,
the music was all in his mind. As THE MONTAGE ends...

INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY 72
Click. Will closes his Bic pen. Ais application is finished.

FEMALE VOICE
Need help grading those papers?

He looks up to reveal Emma standing there, a bit breathless.

WILL
It's an application to H.W. Menken.
They're hiring.
(self conscious)
C'mon...accounting is sexy.

A moment, then with direct eye contact —-

WILL (CONT'D)
I'll miss you.
 

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 43.

EMMA
Before you leave, can you do me a
fayor? I made an appointment for
you tomorrow, In the career center.
You need some guidance.

WILL
I’m having a kid, Emma. I need
better benefits, more money for
things I never had.

EMMA
Just come, Will. For me?

He hesitates, nods, She exits. As he watches her go —-
73 INT. HALLWAY -— DAY -- LATER 73

Finn retrieves a textbook from his locker. He slams it shut,
and Rachel is right there, startling him.

RACKEL
Didn’t see you at Glee Club today.

PINN
Is that still happening?

RACHEL
I‘ve taken over. I’m interim
director, but I expect the position
will become permanent.

Quinn walks by with Santana. Brightly —

QUINN
Hi, Finn. Hi RuPaul. What are you
doing talking to her?

RACHEL
Science project. We’re lab
partners.

Finn is so relieved to be helped out. Quinn is suspicious.
QUINN
Christ Crusaders, tonight at five.
My house.
She exits. A beat, then -—-
FINN

I should go. I can’t do Glee
anymore, it conflicts with —
74

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 44,

RACHEL
Your reputation? You've really got
something, Finn, and you're
throwing it away. It took years of
discipline and hard work to get
peoples to look at me. And all you
have to do is roll out of bed and
people can’t take their eyes off
you. I'd kill for that.

PINN
I’m gonna be late...

RACHEL
You can't worry about what people
think of you, Finn. You’re better
than all of them.

She gently squeezes his hand, then walks away. Off Finn —-

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -—- DAY -- LATER 74
Finn and Puck, in PRACTICE PADS, walk off the field. Tanaka‘s
prediction proved to be correct -- Finn has rejoined the
herd.

PUCK

What do you want me to do,
apologize? That's not me, dude.
Look, if I joined the Flag Team,
you'd beat the crap out of me. I
just don’t understand why you did
it.

PINN
Schuester told me he'd give me
enough extra credit to pass Spanish
if I joined the club -- I had no
choice. If I failed another class
I'd be off the team. But I quit,
okay? It’s over.

PucK
Cool. And as a welcome back to the
world of the normal, IT got you a
present.

They arrive at a LARGE, BLUE PORT-A-POTTY surrounded by the
JOCK GANG who threw Kurt into the dumpster.

FINN
What's that noise?
 

 

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 45.

75 INT. PORT-A-EPOTTY -— CONTINUOUS 75
Arty SLAMS his wheelchair into the door, trying to escape.
76 EXT. PORT-A-POTTY -— CONTINUOUS 76

PUCK
We got that wheelchair kid inside,
we're gonna flip it.

PINN
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

PucK
He's already in a wheelchair. Come
on, we saved you the first roll.

Bveryone looks at Finn, waiting, laughing, expecting him to
follow through. Finn HESITATES as Arty continues his BANGING.
Is he going to do it? Then, after a few long beats, Finn goes
to the port-a-potty and OPENS THE DOOR. Arty wheels out.

ARTY
Thank you, thank you so much. Oh my
God, the smell.,.

PUCK
What the hell. T can't believe
you're helping out this loser.

PINN
Don’t you get it? We’re all losers.
Everyone in this school, hell
everyone in this town. No one has
any money, most of our parents are
divorced or hate each other. Only
half the kids who graduate ever go
to college and maybe two leave the
state to do it. Our football team
is one and seven and the only win
we have is against that school for
the deaf.

Finn‘s passion just roars out of him.

FINN (CONT'D)
I'm not afraid of being called a
loser because I can accept that
that’s what I am, I am afraid of
turning my back on something that
actually made me happy for the
first time in my sorry life.
 

77

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 4b.

A beat, then a confident Finn starts to wheel Arty away.

PUCK
What...so you're quitting ta join
Homo Explosion?

wit EON
No. Bm doing both. You can’t win
without me. And neither can they.

As they go, Arty licks his finger, touches his ass and makes
a SIZZLING SOUND. Finn isn‘t smiling, though: he hears
something. He looks to the other end of the field and sees
his mom's ex DARREN standing beside his EMERALD DREAMS TRUCK,
hosing down the field. There's a new HOTTIE in the cab and
Journey's “Don‘t Stop Believin'” is BLASTING from a BOOM BOX.

Finn takes the sounds in, remembers how much the music of
that time touches his SOUL. Then, as if struck by a lightning
bolt of INSPIRATION, he wheels Arty away.

INT. AUDITORIUM -- CONTINUGUS 77
The club is rehearsing a dance move. There's an argument.

RACHEL
I know what I'm talking about. I
won my first dance competition when
I was three months old.

Finn slams Arty through the deors, which fly open.

KURT
This is a closed rehearsal.

FINN
Look, I owe you guys an apology. TI
shouldn't have quit.

MERCEDES
Whatever. I’m about to quit. Take
myself to Ponderosa.

FINN
Por too many years, I've been a
total douchebag. I don't want to be
the guy who just drives around
throwing eggs at people.

RACHEL
That was you?
 

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 47.

KURT
You and your friends threw pee
balloons at me.

FINN
I know.

KURT
You nailed all my lawn furniture to
my roof.

FINN

I wasn't there for that, but I'm
really sorry. Look, that isn't who
I am and I'm tired of it. This is
what I want to be doing. With you
guys. I used to think that this was
like the lamest thing on earth. And
maybe it is, but...there’s a reason
why we're all here. It’s because we
all want to be good at something.

hey‘re taken aback. Then:

FINN (CONT'D)
Arty, you play guitar, right? Think
you could recruit the jazz band?

ARTY
Sure.

FINN
Mercedes, We need new costumes.
And they have to be cool. Can you
do that?

MERCEDES
DAMN, don't you see what I got on?

FINN
Great. Rachel, you're gonna
choreograph.
She smiles despite herself, thrilled to use her talents.

FINN (CONT'D)
Tina, what are you good at?

TINA
W-W-W>-W=W-W ss «

FINN
We'll figure out something for you.

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 48.

MERCEDES
What are you bringin’ to the table,
Justin Timberlake?

FINN
I've got the music.

Off the kids, their interest piqued, we hear:

EMMA'S VOICE
I want to show you something.

INT. EMMA‘S GUIDANCE. OFFICE -- THE NEXT DAY 78

Will sits waiting 4s Emma grabs a VIDEOCASSETTE from her
desk, puts it in the VCR.

EMMA
I did a little research. This is a
‘tape they had in the library of the
93 team at Nationals in Epcot.

The GRAINY IMAGE begins to play on the screen. After a few
seconds she PAUSES the tape, just as the camera catches a
CLOSE UP of a JOYFUL young BOY, his mouth open in mid-song
(we should remember this featured face from the opening),

EMMA (CONT'D)
Do you know who that is?

Will just stares with quiet emotion -- this is hard for him.

EMMA (CONT’D)
It’s you, Will -- happier than I’ve
ever seen you.

WILL
(softly)
That was the greatest moment of my
life.

EMMA
Why?

WILL
I loved what I was doing. I knew
before we were half-way through
with that number that we were going
to win. Being a part of that, in
that moment...I knew who I was in
the world. The only time I’ve felt
that way since then was when Terri
told me I was going to be a father.

"Pilot" Blue Revisions 10/21/08 4g.

WILL (CONT'D)
(then)
I need to provide for my family.

EMMA.
Provide what? The understanding
that nothing is more important than
money? Or the idea that the only
life worth living is one that
you're passionate about?

That hits Will right where he lives. PUSH IN on his face as
the first notes of a Glee Club VERSION of “Don’t Stop
Believin’” begins to play...

INT. HALLWAY -- DAY 79

Will walks down the hallway, passing the auditorium. He
hears singing. He pauses, then sneaks in the door. New
Directions is on stage in new costumes, cute cut-up tops over
torn jeans and Chuck Taylors. Finn and Rachel sing a capella
in front of the choir, who hums a simple harmony.

FINN
"JUST A SMALL TOWN GIRL/ LIVING IN
A LONELY WORLD.../ SHE TOOK THE
MIDNIGHT TRAIN GOING ANYWHERE..."

RACHEL
"JUST A CITY BOY/ BORN AND RAISED
IN SOUTH DETROIT.../ HE TOOK THE
MIDNIGHT TRAIN GOING ANYWHERE..."

It’s JOURNEY. And it’s incredibly emotional...because the
kids are really FEELING it. Arty wails a sick guitar lick,
and the JAZZ BAND surges in. The choir starts to dance behind
them. They look and sound really different...what they lack
in expertise they make up for in sweet youthful enthusiasm.
Everyone starts te sing:

EVERYONE
“WORKING HARD TO GET MY FILL/
EVERYBODY WANTS A THRILL.../
PLAYING ANYTHING TO ROLL THE DICE
JUST ONE MORE TIME...“

PUSH IN on Will, unseen in the back of the theatre,
overwhelmed by what he’s seeing. For a moment he can’t move,
He slowly moves to the kids as ——

The New Directions have found their groove as they continue
practicing "Don‘t Stop Believin’.” The jazz band sinks their
teeth into the chorus, and the choir sings in a piercing
seven-part harmony. Even Tina has found a place here -- she's
@ HUMAN BEAT BOX.
 

 

“Pilot” Blue Revisions 10/21/08 50.

As they move through their positions, they share looks across
the stage, laughs and smiles between them, breathless;
sweating...they’re on fire.

EVERYONE (CONT'D)
“DON'T STOP BELIEVING...HOLD ON TO
THAT FE-E-5-EDING...STRE-E-ET
LIFE...PE-E-OPLE..."

Finn and Rachel share a look that hints of something to come.

EVERYONE (CONT'D)
“DON'T STOP BELIEVING... HOLD ON TO
THAT FE-E-ELING! DON'T STOP!!!"

They hit their final position, hold it, panting through
ecstatic smiles. Suddenly, the sound of someone CLAPPING.

The kids see Will, standing there, smiling at them. A moment.
Then after a beat of careful deliberation --

WILL
Good, guys. It's a 9, we need a 10,
Pinn, I think if we worked on it,
you could hit a high EB. Rachel,
easy on the jazzhands and let's try
te get those bangs out of your
face. Mercedes, sometimes when you
sing, it looks like you're in pain,

MERCEDES
‘Cuz it HURTS to be this good.

REVEAL Sue standing in the back of the auditorium; she’s in
one doorway, Puck is in another. Their expressions hint
future-powerplays to come. They exit.

FINN
(to Will)
So...does this mean you're staying?

WILL
(with emotion)
It would kill me to watch you win
Nationals without me.
Huge smiles. Then, overwhelmed with pride and potential:
WILL (CONT’D)
From the top.
