Forward.

To Whom It May Concern,

| wrote this script in the Spring of 2009 when | was 22, about to turn 23. | wanted to
make a movie utilizing my dad’s law offices in Phoenix, Arizona, and so | came up with
this story about stockbrokers creating a ponzi scheme. This was around the time that
the Bernie Madoff scandal broke and it was everywhere. | finished the first draft in two
weeks and six months later we were shooting.

| constantly read scripts online and thought it was only fair to “pay it forward” by posting
my own script as well. It was my first produced feature screenplay and although I’ve
improved as a writer since then, I’m still very proud that we got this made. (it’s currently
available on iTunes and | now liken it to a micro budget “Wolf of Wall Street”)

Enjoy and please look out for my new work as well.
Sincerely,

Cole Mueller.

FADE IN:
EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON A FEW BULLETS BEING LOADED INTO A CHAMBER.
INT. OFFICE -- NIGHT

WE ARE WIDE on this darkly lit office. A giant glass wall
overlooks the bright, city lights of Phoenix, Arizona.

Standing in the middle of the room is a MAN that we can't
identify.

He holds a gun in his hands, clutching it tightly.
INT. WHITE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

WE ARE CENTERED ON A WHITE HALLWAY -- THREE MEN, F.B.I.
OFFICIALS, suddenly rush around the corner.

They're holding a few folders, walking briskly...

OFFICIAL #1
He's ready-

OFFICIAL #2
-Full confession?

OFFICIAL #1
Full confession.

OFFICIAL #3
He wants total immunity.

They turn the corner and enter a small dark room, where a single
light shines over a MAN at a table. WE NEVER SEE the man's face.

The three men pull up chairs across from him.

One of them pulls out a small recording device, sets it up in
front of the man.

OFFICIAL #2
Someone went to work on that eye.

The man doesn't respond.

Official #2 reaches over and hits record on the recording
device.

OFFICIAL #2 (CONT'D)
Okay...tell us what happened...
INT. OFFICE -- NIGHT

The other man continues to clutch the gun, staring out at the
city.

Finally, in one swift movement, he raises it to his head and
fires...

ROLL OPENING CREDITS.
cut TO:
INT. OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

Our guys, LEVI CHARLES, TRAVIS HOWARD, ANDREW THOMAS, and BILLY
ADAMS sit around a conference table, talking to JEFF REYNOLDS,
an older man in his late 50's with short, white hair.

LEVI
We're an exclusive group here,
Jeffrey. Do you realize that?

JEFF
I guess so-

LEVI
-How long have I known you?

JEFF
About...four years.

LEVI
Okay. No offense, but the only reason
we are talking right now is because
I've built a rapport with you.

ANDREW
We have twenty other people that want
to meet with us but we're sitting here

with you.

BILLY
We don't let just anyone invest with
us.

TRAVIS
We're trying to maintain an image.
JEFF
Yes, of course.

TRAVIS
Someone's gonna get rich. It might
as well be you.

LEVI
Do you understand what this
opportunity is? I mean, do you truly
understand what this opportunity is?

JEFF
Um...

LEVI
Tell'em Billy.

BILLY
We will all but guarantee ten percent
back on your investment in the first
month.

JEFF
In the first month?

LEVI

The first month, Jeffrey. You have
to realize...there is a reason that
we are some of the most sought after
brokers in the country right now.
It's because we've created our brand.
The Phoenix Group brand. And it
stands for strength, reliability and
consistency.

JEFF
I just don't like how the minimums-

ANDREW
-There's only a minimum so we can know
that you are serious about the
investment. Serious about the
commitment.

JEFF
Well...

ANDREW
Look-If you feel uncomfortable after
a few months and you want your money
back, you can just pull out, and
that'll be it.

TRAVIS
But you won't. Because after you see
the returns you're getting in the
first two months, you'll be dying to
give us more money.

LEVI
Do you know how our site works,
Jeffrey?

JEFF
Not really.

LEVI
Well, let me break it down really
quick. We have implemented a system,
utilizing the internet, that allows
our investors to constantly keep
track of their net gains. Billy here
is the computer whiz that created it.

BILLY
It's set up so that you can look at
your account at any time, and
actually see where your money is
going. You will be fully aware of any
fluctuation. Complete transparency.

JEFF
And I'1l have access to that account?

He looks at each man and then over to Levi. He flashes a big
grin.

LEVI
No, Jeffrey. But let me assure
you...it's in safe hands.
CUT TO:
INT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Luxurious high-rise, overlooking the lights of Phoenix,
Arizona.
CLOSE-UP ON A CIGAR BEING LIT -- WE PULL BACK TO SEE OUR FOUR

MEN LIGHTING CIGARS, smiling, wearing expensive cut
Levi admires his cigar and proclaims...

LEVI
Welcome to the twenty-first century,
gentlemen.

SUPERTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THAT
January 1st, 2000.

ANDREW
Feels good.

LEVI
This is our time. This is our time
to define what the twenty-first
century is going to represent. Wecan
shape it.

BILLY
The first outlaws of the new
millennium.

ANDREW
I get to be Wyatt Earp.

TRAVIS
Fuck that, Andrew. I'm Wyatt.

ANDREW
No, you're more of a side kick.
You're more of a Doc Holliday.

BILLY
I get to be Billy the Kid...cuz...
well...my name's Billy...

He grins.

TRAVIS
Nice reasoning, Bill.

ANDREW
Well, Billy the Kid died when
he was twenty-one. You still wanna
be him?

BILLY

suits.

READS :
Well I’m still alive, aren’t I?

TRAVIS
No way I'm Doc Holliday.

ANDREW
Just live with it, Travis.

Levi steps back and grandly says...

LEVI
(smiling)
I'm Jesse James.

BILLY
Jesse James wasn't black.

LEVI
So?

ANDREW
You can't be Jesse James.

LEVI
I'm the black Jesse James.

BILLY
Doesn't work like that.

LEVI
Fuck yourselves.

TRAVIS
Yeah, you're gonna have to be...
well...you're fucked.

LEVI
I'm Jesse James because I say I
am.

TRAVIS

Whatever, Levi.

ANDREW
So we've decided? Billy is Billy.
Travis is Doc. Levi is Jesse James.

BILLY
Black Jesse James.
ANDREW
Black Jesse James. And I'm Wyatt
Earp.

TRAVIS
And what are we called?

ANDREW
I don't know.

BILLY
I think we're more of a Rat Pack if
you ask me.

ANDREW
That's not gonna work because
everyone wants to be Sinatra.

BILLY
And Levi won't wanna be Sammy Davis.

LEVI
I'd be Sinatra.

TRAVIS
Black Sinatra?

LEVI
Look--How about we just all shut the
fuck up and get down to business, huh?
I wanna get back to the point I was
trying to make.

Everyone quiets down...

LEVI (CONT'D)
Gentlemen--We can define this
century. The internet is allowing us
to do things we've never done before.
It's allowing us...to do what we're
doing.

ANDREW
Scamming the shit outta people.

LEVI
We are not "scamming" people.

BILLY
How is it different?
LEVI
Because...these people will never
feel the affects of losing their
money. All we're doing is searching
for oil, and when we find it, we
extract a small, insignificant
share.

BILLY
Well, insignificant to them.

LEVI
These people. .how many people we have
already?

ANDREW
Seventeen.

LEVI

Seventeen! Okay, clearly, they're
all fucking millionaires. They give
us that one hundred thousand...like
Peter Williams did...they give us
that one hundred thousand knowing its
just going to sit in that account and
accumulate cash flow. It's money
they never plan on touching in the
first place!

BILLY
Good point.

ANDREW
Yeah.

LEVI

We are taking money from people
that already have it...people that
plan on dying rich...and we're giving
it to the new generation...us!

TRAVIS
Gotta keep it going is all.

LEVI
Gotta keep it going.

ANDREW
Gotta stay out of trouble.
LEVI
We will...as long as we
communicate...collaborate...and
continue finding investors. This
isn't going to work if we let up.
Seventeen is good. It is. But it's
not eighteen. And eighteen isn't
nineteen. And nineteen isn't
motherfucking twenty.

TRAVIS
I think getting that call room was a
good idea.

LEVI
We hired anyone yet?

TRAVIS
We hired the main manager, not the
telemarketers.

LEVI
Okay, well we gotta get on that.

ANDREW
I'm still against it.

LEVI
What do you mean?

ANDREW
Well, before it was just private
investors we met through
connections. Now it's cold calls? I
don't know.

BILLY
But the problem is we ran outta
connections, Andrew.

LEVI
It's fine. Anything gets
fishy...ever...all we do is get rid
of the call room.

ANDREW
Yeah...

LEVI
Okay, gentlemen. Time to roll.
Let's go.

SLOW-MOTION -- WE DOLLY BACK WITH THEM AS THEY ALL WALK ACROSS
THE ROOM AND OVER TO THE FRONT DOOR.

THE SCREEN SPLITS INTO FOUR SEPARATE FRAMES, EACH FRAME WITH
A SHOT OF EACH MAN AS THEY WALK.

cut TO:

WE SHOW A QUICK SCENE FROM EACH MAN'S INDIVIDUAL LIFE AND THEIR
CONFLICT:

INT. CASINO -- NIGHT

Packed casino. Travis is sitting down at the Texas Hold'em
table, looking over his cards. Finally...

TRAVIS
Fuck it. I'm all-in.

He pushes his chips into the middle of the table, and pulls out
a cigarette. He whips out a lighter but before he can light
it...

DEALER
No smoking, sir.

TRAVIS
The most nerve-racking game in the
world, you can't fuckin' smoke?

The man across from him, contemplates his call, and...

GAMBLER
I call.

Travis looks shocked.

The man flips his cards over and shows pocket Kings. Travis
is beat.

He freaks out...
TRAVIS
FUCK! You're slow playing Kings!

You fuckin' bitch!

Travis has a gambling problem to say the least...
cut TO:
INT. OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

Billy, dressed in a suit and tie, sits across from his father,
MR. ADAMS, a foreboding man of great stature.

MR. ADAMS
You are doing well for yourself, son.

BILLY
Thanks, father.

MR. ADAMS
But you know, your line of work
can fluctuate immensely.

Billy grins...

BILLY
Well...not necessarily...

MR. ADAMS
What I'm trying to say is...I want
you to go to Law School.

BILLY
Law School?

MR. ADAMS
Everyone in our family...it's your
rite of passage, Bill.

BILLY
That's not gonna happen.

MR. ADAMS
Look at your brother. You know how
much money he's making right now?

CUT TO:
INT. ANDREW'S HOME -- NIGHT
Andrew is sitting indian-style on the bed with his new
girlfriend, HEATHER. They're playing a card game and also

playing "would you rather" at the same time.

ANDREW
Would you rather have one arm or one
leg?

She responds quickly...

She slaps

She slaps

HEATHER
One arm.

a card down...

ANDREW
Higher.

the next card down.

HEATHER
Fly or teleport?

ANDREW
Fly, no question. Lower. You know,
we're supposed to be taking shots in
this game I think.

HEATHER
Not necessarily.

ANDREW
Eight feet tall or two feet tall?

She laughs.

HEATHER
Two feet?! Umm....eight feet tall,
easy.

ANDREW
How is that easy?

HEATHER
It just is.

ANDREW
Higher.

HEATHER

Okay, I have a good one.

ANDREW
I'm ready.
HEATHER
Would you rather...be rich and die
young...or be broke and die old...

He looks at her closely...

ANDREW
Good question.

cut TO:
INT. LEVI'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

WE ARE CLOSE-UP ON A STEREO SYSTEM -- A HAND COMES IN AND TURNS
UP THE VOLUME.

Levi steps back from the stereo, wearing a wife-beater, jeans.
He looks really high, and is nodding his head to the beat of
the music with his eyes closed. He does that for a moment and
then comes back over to the couch and plops down.

He leans over the coffee table and starts rolling a blunt of
weed.

He continues nodding his head, the music flowing through him.
He zones out.

We pull back...leaving him alone...in isolation...and
finally...

FADE OUT:
cut TO:
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

Our four guys are shaking hands with two ASIAN BUSINESSMEN. They
exchange "goodbyes."

EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- LATER

The four men walk out of a doorway and wander through the parking
garage...

LEVI
Great work, gentlemen.

ANDREW
You think they're in?
A beat.

LEVI
Of course.

ANDREW
I don't know. They seemed pretty damn
skeptical.

LEVI
No, no, no. We got ‘em. Trust me.
We wait two days, then call them back.
We'll get it. Billy, I liked that
thing you said about "risk."

BILLY
Thanks.

TRAVIS

Guys...I just don't...I don't
know...I feel like we should be going
after some bigger fish here. I
mean...these guys...maybe they
invest our minimum...but I'm not
trying to nickel and dime this shit.
I want the big run, the big hit.

ANDREW
The big hit is how we get fucked! The
big hit is how we get the SEC all over
our backs.

LEVI
Hold on, holdon. Travis--Do you have
something in mind?

TRAVIS
Well...
BILLY
You got someone, don't you?
TRAVIS
I do.
ANDREW
Who?

Travis contemplates bringing this up, but finally...
TRAVIS
This guy...Tan'el.

LEVI
Tan'el?

TRAVIS
Tan'el Garcia.

ANDREW
Is this that Mexico City connection?

TRAVIS
Yes.

ANDREW
No--Screw that guy!

LEVI
What? I haven't heard about this.

ANDREW
Travis met some guy playing-

TRAVIS
-Can I speak for myself?

Andrew bites his lip, steps back.
Travis prepares his story and then delivers...

TRAVIS (CONT'D)

Okay. Well, I was playing in this
underground hold'em tournament,
exclusive shit, fifty thousand
dollar buy in. Atlantic city about
two months ago. Well, I'm hot,
seriously fuckin' hot. I'm check
raising blind before the flop and
hitting. Just pure magic, man.

AS HE IS TELLING THE STORY, WE SHOW A FLASHBACK OF THE ACTUAL
INCIDENT.

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
Well, I'm the chip leader and people
are starting to take notice. After
awhile, they combine a few tables,
and I get put next to this big fuckin'
Carlos Santana motherfucker, chest
hair, gold chains, sunglasses, the
whole damn archetype man. This guy
just smells like money. So, we start
this little convo. And the whole
time, I'm pitching myself as a
broker, playing it off like I'm
fuckin' Gordon Gekko and shit. But,
we aren't playing against each other,
until finally I hit big and go all-in.
Well, this fucker calls me, flips
over a damn straight flush. A
straight fuckin' flush. I lose
everything. As I'm walking away, he
pulls me aside and says..."I'1ll give
you a chance to make some of that
back." He slides me his card and says
“you make it to my city, we'll talk
business." Talkin' about Mexico
City.

LEVI
Perfect. Great lead.

ANDREW
Finish the story, Travis.

TRAVIS
Well, it turns out, this guy runs the
largest drug operation in Mexico, and
isn't even allowed
in the U.S.

BILLY
Geez, Travis.

TRAVIS
But this guy...he's a big fish.
Fuckin' Moby Dick, man!

ANDREW
Scamming these middle-aged
Republicans is one thing but you
gotta be insane to fuck with a drug
lord. We could be negotiating, and
out of nowhere this guy could think
somethin's up and fuckin' kill us!

DREAM SEQUENCE:
Tan'el sits across from our four guys. He gives a scowl and
in SLOW-MOTION whips out a 9mm, stands and BLASTS ALL OF OUR
GUYS IN THE CHEST, ONE BY ONE, BLOOD IGNITING FROM THEIR BODIES
and QUICKLY CUT BACK TO REALITY...

INT. PARKING GARAGE --

LEVI
Well, that's the debate then, isn't
it? Billy, wat'd you say in there
about risk again?

BILLY
Basically just...no risk, no reward.
No big risk, no big reward.

LEVI
No big risk, no big reward.

He smiles. Andrew looks around at the others and notices he's
the only one who is nervous about this.

They stand in silence for a moment.
MUSIC CUE TAKING US TO...

CUT TO:
INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY

The guys are sitting on a private plane, wearing suits, cool
sunglasses, traveling to...Mexico City.

EXT. RUNWAY -- DAY

The plane lands on a private runway outside of Mexico City. The
four men are met by a private limousine. They get in.

EXT. RANCH -- DAY

The limo pulls up to a huge ranch estate. The four men get out,
wearing their suits, looking sharp.

Billy takes off his sunglasses...

BILLY
Holy shit.

LEVI
Chill Bill.
INT. WHITE SURVEILLANCE VAN -- SAME TIME

Large surveillance van probably two miles away. There are THREE
F.B.I. officials sitting around a tracking and recording
device, surveillance video.

They're drinking coffee.
One of the men sips his drink and burns his mouth...

OFFICIAL #1
Fuck that's hot!

MIKE NORTHCUTT, a strong, intelligent man, will become a central
figure in the story...

MIKE
I told you.

OFFICIAL #1
Whaddya mean you told me, you
didn't say shit.
MIKE
I told you! Didn't I say something,
Dan? I said "cool it off."
OFFICIAL #1
I don’t need any advice froma fuckin’
rookie.

MIKE
Rookie? Where?

OFFICIAL #1
Right..(he points at him) there.

MIKE
Please..I was in the field for ten years
before they begged me to help out on your
unit.

OFFICIAL #2

Whatever you say, Mike.
MIKE
That’s not subjective, that’s a mother
fuckin’ fact.

He reaches into his pocket and takes out some nicorette gum.
He pops a piece into his mouth.

OFFICIAL #2
Nicorette?
MIKE
Yeah.
OFFICIAL #2
You’re really losing your edge.
Mike doesn’t react.
INT. RANCH -- DAY

Our guys are being led through the house by a hired ASSISTANT.
This place is a palace, the product of drug money.

Billy and Andrew are looking around, admiring the place. Levi
and Travis walk ahead of them, staring straight forward.

They turn the corner to see TAN'EL GARCIA, 40's, overweight,
watching a movie, holding his young nephew in his lap. He hears
their footsteps and turns...

TAN'EL
Gentlemen!

He moves his nephew to the side and gets up...

TRAVIS
Good to see you again, Mr. Garcia.

LEVI
Great to meet you.

They all shake hands.

INT. DINING ROOM, RANCH -- LATER
They all sit around this huge dining room table. Tan'el's
assistant wanders around with a cigar box and offers one to each
of them.

They each take one and put it to their lips.

TRAVIS
Been hittin' any of the tables
lately?
Tan'el laughs.
TAN'EL

Of course! And if you want your money
taken again, lemme know.

TRAVIS
(grinning)
Any time, any place.
Tan'el laughs again.
The assistant wanders around once more and lights each cigar.

He grows serious, wanting to get down to business.

TAN'EL
So talk to me, talk to me, talk to me.

LEVI
Well, how much do you know about us?

TAN'EL
Nothing.

LEVI
Our job is to make you money.

ANDREW
You provide the capitol, and we
provide the interest.

BILLY
Heavy interest.

LEVI
We guarantee returns.

TAN'EL
Guarantee?
LEVI
Ask any one of our partners and you'11l
hear the same thing. We do not
bullshit. We are in the business of
making money.

INT. WHITE SURVEILLANCE VAN -- SAME TIME

Mike has his headphones on, listens intently to the
conversation. He turns up the volume on his mixer.

OFFICIAL #1
Who are these guys?

INT. DINING ROOM, RANCH -- DAY

LEVI
We have connections, relationships
we've developed, that allow us and
help assist us to predict the market
and make the calculated decisions
necessary to put benjamins in your
pocket.

INT. WHITE SURVEILLANCE VAN -- SAME TIME

MIKE
Fuckin' insider trading?

INT. DINING ROOM, RANCH --

ANDREW
You at least know our track record,
right? Travis filled you in?

TAN'EL
Yes, yes. He pumped you guys up.

ANDREW
So, you're aware of our reputation
then?

TAN'EL
I am.

ANDREW

Okay, then before we go further, what
kinds of questions and concerns do
you have about the process?
A beat.

TAN'EL
Well...you know...I work hard for my
money. I work for twenty years to get
to where I am. Twenty years. Twenty
years of gathering,
accumulating...wealth, power...to
get to where I am today. To get all
of this! So, now that I am here, now
that I am on the pedestal, as you
will, I don't plan on jumping off. I
plan on staying up on my fucking
pedestal.

ANDREW
Of course-

TAN'EL
-Do you know how I stay on my
pedestal? By making good decisions.
By making the right decisions. I
don't partner with people, rule
number one. I don't trust anyone. I
don't get fucked, rule number two.

TRAVIS
That's a pretty good rule.

TAN'EL
I expect my money to grow...if I'm
with you guys...I expect straight
forwardness...I expect honesty-

BILLY
-You can trust us, sir.

Tan'el sits back in his chair.

He slowly takes out a gun from his belt and sets it on the table.

TAN’EL
Every man’s gun is like an extension
of their dick. This right here? This
is my dick. Do you know what I do with

it? I fuck with it. And I fuck people up
with it. You guys trying to pull something
on me? You guys lose my money? You get

fucked.

LEVI
I..understand.
He grins, the guys don’t know if they should laugh or not.

TAN'EL
Lemme show you something.

INT. DINING ROOM, RANCH -- LATER

They all stand around a huge, framed painting on the wall.
Tan'el is standing in front of them, admiring it.

TAN'EL
See that? Guess how much that cost.

TRAVIS
Um...sixty bucks?

Levi hits him in the arm.

TAN'EL

That painting right there cost me one
hundred thousand dollars. But, it
was an investment. Because now, I
have people come over, look at the
painting, I tell them how much it
cost, and they are impressed. It
reflects positively on me. I paid to
impress people...and it continues to
pay off. I want the same thing in all
of my investments.

LEVI
Of course.

TAN'EL
I like you boys. I wouldn't have
given Travis my card if I didn't like
him. I felt...guilty about taking
his money.
TRAVIS
Okay, okay.

TAN'EL

My point is that I take risks. I
realize that it takes money to make
money. But if I don't make money, if
I lose money, someone is going to get
their balls cut off. If I invest with
you gentlemen, and I lose money,
which one of you is going to get it?

 

ANDREW
What?

Tan’el whips out a pocket knife...

They look

TAN'EL
Which one of you is going to get their
balls cut off?

at each other strangely.
TAN'EL (CONT'D)
You want my money? I could make it

all of you...?

TRAVIS
Billy volunteers!

BILLY
What?!

TRAVIS
C'mon, Bill! Take one for the team
here!

BILLY

This isn't fuckin' dodgeball! He's
talking about cutting off my balls,
man!

DREAM SEQUENCE:

ANDREW
Not me. I got a girlfriend. I need
mine.

LEVI

I'll fuckin' voluntee, damn. Put it
on me. And you wanna know why? Cuz
you aren't losing shit. You have my
word.

TAN'EL
Okay!

He shakes his hand.

TAN'EL (CONT'D)
Hopefully we'll both keep what we
got.

He flashes a big smile.

TAN'EL (CONT'D)
I’ma gambler, a risk taker, it’s what
I do, it’s howI survive, it’s why I’m
where I am. But I’m
also a little crazy.

(a beat)
Alright! I will invest in you
boys...I will invest...I have a small
account that just sits there...doin'
nothin' but sittin', gettin'
cobwebs...I will invest that...

Levi leans in...

LEVI
How much?

TAN'EL
Ten.

BILLY
Ten what?

TAN'EL
Million.

The others looks shocked, but immediately try to hide it...
LEVI
Well, great!

TAN'EL
Do you know who's on the million
dollar bill?

BILLY
Um-

TAN'EL
-ME! Keep it that way.

He tosses his pocket knife to Travis...
TAN’‘EL (CONT’D)

And keep that as a reminder.

Travis looks down at the knife and clutches it tight.

score.

INT. PRIVATE AIRPLANE -- LATER
They pile into the small aircraft.

ANDREW
Can you believe this?!

BILLY
Ten million!

Billy starts hyperventilating..
BILLY (CONT'D)
That’s a lot of..pressure...

Travis gives him a strange look...
TRAVIS

Will you chill out please?

Travis sits down, starts to light up a cigarette...

ANDREW (CONT'D)

This is the biggest score we'll

probably ever get!
LEVI

Relax, relax. Everyone just relax.
TRAVIS

Levi's just on edge cuz he put his

balls on the line.

LEVI
Well that's part of it!

They all laugh.
LEVI (CONT'D)
But do you guys realize...with an
investment like that...for the

scheme to work...we need more
investors to keep it going.

ANDREW
Yeah but-

LEVI
-We got more work to do fellas.

cut TO:
INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

Andrew and Heather are having dinner, celebrating over some
champagne.

They hold up their glasses to toast...

ANDREW
A toast!

HEATHER
To what?
ANDREW
You have to toast to something?

HEATHER
Of course!

ANDREW
We can't just clink our glasses
together?

HEATHER
No silly!

Okay, well, toast to Mexico!

Si? I bet that's the only Spanish
word you know.

HEATHER
Nu uh.

Okay. What else you know?

HEATHER
Gracias. And...fiesta...

ANDREW
Wow, are you bilingual or something?

HEATHER
Shut up.

They smile and sip their wine.

HEATHER (CONT'D)
So tell me about this deal?

ANDREW
We got a really big investment.

HEATHER
How much?

ANDREW
I don't wanna go into details, babe.

HEATHER
That's not really a detail.

ANDREW
That's definitely a detail. I'll
tell you that...it's alot...and it's
going to make our lives better.

HEATHER
Well, that's good then.

ANDREW
Yeah.

HEATHER
How about I guess how much the
investment was?

ANDREW
No.

HEATHER
C'mon!

ANDREW

Geez, fine.

HEATHER
Okay...

She ponders...

HEATHER (CONT'D)
Fifty million?!

Andrew coughs on his wine, and spits some of it out.

ANDREW
Dear lord, I wish!

They start laughing.

HEATHER
Well...now that you're gonna be
making a lot of money, how are you
gonna protect yourself?

ANDREW
What do you mean?

HEATHER
Andrew, it's the year two-thousand
now. You know how many scams they
have these days?

Andrew shrugs.

HEATHER (CONT'D)
I just heard about some guy stealing
people's identities online and
getting into their accounts and
things like that.

ANDREW
Baby, you don't have to worry about
that-

HEATHER

-You're gonna feel pretty stupid if
some computer hacker takes all your
money, your hard earned money-

ANDREW
That's not gonna happen. You're
crazy.

HEATHER

Why risk it though?

ANDREW
So what're you saying? That I
shouldn't have a bank account?

HEATHER
I just think you should have some type
of backup plan in the times we're
living in.

ANDREW
I'm pretty sure all my money is
insured.

HEATHER

I think you should just keep a little
nest egg in cash.

ANDREW
And what? Bury it in our fuckin'
backyard?

EXT. BACKYARD, ANDREW'S HOUSE -- LATER

Andrew finishes shoveling some dirt over a hole as Heather
stands a few feet behind him, waiting patiently.

Andrew's sweating hard and stops to wipe the sweat off of his
forehead...

HEATHER
One million in cash...completely
safe...

She turns and heads back toward the house. Andrew turns around
and glares at her.

INT. OFFICE — DAY

CLOSE-UP ON A PIECE OF NICORETTE GUM — Mike takes the piece and
pops it into his mouth. WIDER NOW — We see Mike is sitting in
his office — He checks his watch, grabs a few folders and walks
into the hallway. We follow him, he passes a few people. No
one says “Hi” to him.

INT. F.B.I. -- LATER

Mike is sitting around a conference table with a bunch of other
F.B.I. officials.

PETER DONNELLY, late 50's, high official, booming voice,
strides into the roonm..

PETER
What’s F.B.I. stand for people?!

He’s drinking coffee, walking quickly. A young official starts
to respond until Peter cuts him off...

PETER (CONT'D)
Fidelity, bravery, and motherfucking
integrity. That’s what you should
say to yourself before you start every
day. Those five little words

that just roll off the tongue and make

you wanna DO YOUR FUCKING JOB.
(overemphasizing)

Say it with me people.

The group follows unenthusiastically..

ALL
Fidelity..bravery..and mother..fucking..
integrity.

PETER
Fantastic.

He sips his coffee.
Another young OFFICIAL walks in late...

YOUNG OFFICIAL
Sorry I’m late.

PETER
The only person that can be late
in this room is me. Do it again
and I’1l pour this delicious coffee
down your pants..and that’s not a threat.
Okay! Who’s gonna start?!

He glances over at Mike...

PETER (CONT'D)
Northcutt--Brief us on the Garcia
operation.

MIKE
We're still doing investigations.

PETER
Anything substantial?

MIKE
It's no secret the kind of
ring that he has going on down there.
But, this isn't like raiding a crack
house in Compton. We make the wrong
step, and this sets up a war.

PETER
You have funding to continue your
program.

MIKE
I actually had something
else...that...is now kind of

interesting...
PETER
What?
MIKE

Tan'el met with some brokers but...

PETER
Who would've thought the fat fuck
would play Wall Street?

He smiles.

MIKE
It's more than that. These guys he
met with...there's something off
about it...

PETER
We're trying to bring down a drug
lord, not some yuppy, stock brokers.

MIKE
But-—

PETER
-Did you get names?

MIKE
Just their business title. The
Phoenix Group.

PETER
SEC on them yet?

MIKE
They were audited last year, no red
flags but...

PETER

Well tell'em to do another.

Mike scribbles something into a notebook, he seems frustrated.
PETER (CONT'D)
Who’s next?!

CUT TO:
INT. OFFICE BUILDING --
Levi and Billy walk out of an elevator, wearing sharp suits.

They rush quickly through the hall and turn the corner into the
call room.

INT. CALL ROOM, OFFICE BUILDING --

The room is lined with desks, where telemarketers are sitting
down, talking on the phones, looking over their cold call lists.

At the head of the room is RICHARD MARTIN, mid-20's.

Everyone stops and looks at Billy and Levi as they enter the
room.

Richard sees them and darts over, shaking their hands...

RICHARD
Gentlemen, hey.

BILLY
Lookin' good in here.

RICHARD
Thanks. I got everyone working
really hard. Gathering a shit load
of leads.

LEVI
How are the pitches coming?

RICHARD
Good. It's the first week. Some are
better than others.

LEVI
No, no, no. Fuck that. Everyone's
pitch needs to be fire. If there's
someone who's weak on the phones, not
getting leads, you fucking fire them!
No weak links.
He shouts out over the room...

LEVI (CONT'D)
Hear that boys! No leads, no fuckin'
job!

Levi walks over to the nearest telemarketer and kneels down next
to him.

LEVI (CONT'D)
Let's hear your pitch.

The TELEMARKETER looks nervous, doesn't move...

LEVI (CONT'D)
Wanna take a picture? C'mon, make a
call!

The young man dials a number from his call sheet, waits for an
answer and gets it...

TELEMARKETER
Hi! How are you, sir? Oh, I mean,
maam. No, I'm sorry, I...well...I'm
from The Phoenix Group and-

Levi rips the phone out of his hand and hangs it up...

LEVI
What the fuck was that?!

TELEMARKETER
Uh...

LEVI
You're a fuckin' salesman man! Did
you sound like a salesman there?

TELEMARKETER
Uh...

LEVI
No, you didn't. You know what you
sounded like? You sounded like a
fuckin' pussy! Are you a pussy?

TELEMARKETER
Um...no.

LEVI
No you aren't. You know why? Because
we don't have pussies in this room,
sir. We have salesmen. And you're
in this room because that's what you
are!

TELEMARKETER
Yes, sir.

LEVI
Okay, your first mistake. You can't
ask them how they are right off the
bat. Someone calls up and asks how
you are you're gonna say who the fuck
is this? The suspicion grows
immediately. So,
you have to hit them with your
identity immediately. "Hi, sir.
This is Big Fuckin' Pussy at the
Phoenix Group. I'mcurious, have you
heard of us?" Of course
they haven't heard of us, but this
gives us a little bit of credibility
as if they should know us. After they
say no, you
say “okay, great. Well, let me tell
you a little bit about what we do."
Never tell them it's a sales call.
They'll fuckin' hang up. And never
tell them you're going
to make them money. They'11 hang up.
All you do is tell them that you'd
like to inform them about our
services and that if they would like
more information then you can connect
them directly to a broker
for a consultation. You book the
consultation, that's a lead. That's
how you get commission.

TELEMARKETER
(sheepishly)
We get commission here?

Levi glances over at Richard...

RICHARD
I told him!
Levi looks at the telemarketer, then back at Richard.

LEVI
Can I talk to you outside for a
minute?

BILLY

I'll be right back, Levi.

LEVI
Okay, Bill. Richard, come here.

Levi and Richard walk out into the hallway...
INT. HALLWAY --

LEVI
Richard, we hired you to be the
captain of our ship in there. But
you're not. You need to step up.

RICHARD
I've been teaching those guys none
stop how to pitch. I'mon their backs
constantly.

LEVI
You're a salesman, right? That's
what your resume said. Was your
resume lying?

RICHARD
No, of course not. I have years of-

LEVI
Okay, okay, I don't need to hear any
bullshit. Just do better, alright?

RICHARD
Yeah, yeah.

He pats him on the back.

LEVI
Okay. We're counting on you. Can we
count on you?

RICHARD
Of course.
LEVI
Good.

QUICK CUTS OF TRAVIS DOING COCAINE.
INT. CLUB —

WE FOLLOW TRAVIS AS HE WALKS THROUGH THE CLUB AND OVER TO THE

The music is blasting, the place bumping.

Travis and Billy are in the club, taking shots with a few
attractive women.

Travis is hammered.
Levi walks by, being led by MONICA, his ex-girlfriend.
LEVI
(to the guys)

I'm in trouble. See you later.

TRAVIS
Oh fuck!

They laugh as Monica leads Levi to a booth in the corner.
Billy turns to Travis...

BILLY
That's my last shot, Travis.

TRAVIS
Fuck that! It's only...

He looks at his watch...

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
-One fifteen! We got forty-five
more minutes!

BILLY
You need to slow down.

TRAVIS
That's my fuckin' point, Bill! Why
slow down! Why the fuck should I slow
down! I'11 slow down when I'm dead!

BILLY
That's not the best philosophy.

TRAVIS
We're rich, man! We are fuckin'
rich! And you know what, this is just
the beginning. We're gonna make
more. We're gonna make a lot more!

BILLY
Yeah...

TRAVIS
See...we can't stop...do you realize
that? This is set up to go on forever.

BILLY
That doesn't mean we have to floor the
gas pedal.

TRAVIS
Billy, I'm going ninety in a thirty

Monica continues to lecture Levi...

MONICA
I heard about fuckin' Angela.

So?

MONICA
So?! I heard you let that skank put

LEVI
That's none of your business

MONICA
I'm not lettin' some slut get on my
man.

LEVI

We broke up!
MONICA
We did not break up.

LEVI
What are you talkin' about?! Get out
of Monica World for just one moment
so you can listen to what I'm
saying...so you can absorb this shit.
This...this is nothing.

MONICA
No it's not.

LEVI
Yes it is.

MONICA

No it's not.

LEVI
Yes it is.

They stare at each...and then start making out.
Back to...

INT. CLUB -- SAME TIME

Travis and Billy still talking at the bar.
Travis takes out a huge wad of twenties...

TRAVIS
Bartender!!!

The bartender comes over...

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
Get these ladies whatever they want!

They laugh, Travis smiles and turns back to Billy...

BILLY
You gotta be a little more low key,
man.

TRAVIS

Low key isn't in my nature.

BILLY
Yeah but...

TRAVIS
We gotta live fast.

BILLY
Die young, huh? You tryin' to go out
in a blaze of glory, Travis?
CUT TO:
DREAM SEQUENCE:
We see Travis running down a hallway, looking over his shoulder,
dressed in a suit. We see three cops running after him. He
turns the corner and continues running. The cops turn the
corner, pull out their guns and unload bullets into Travis'
back. SLOW-MOTION AS THE BULLETS PENETRATE HIS FLESH AND HE
FALLS TO THE GROUND.
CUT TO:
INT. BOOTH, CLUB -- SAME TIME

Monica and Levi stop kissing. He looks at her...

LEVI
You don't want to be associated with
me.

MONICA
Why not?

LEVI

Because I'ma bad man. I'ma bad man
and I do bad things.

MONICA
So...

LEVI
So? That doesn't scare you?

MONICA
Nothing scares me.

LEVI
Nothing scares you? I doubt that.

MONICA
I know the real Levi...I know you
aren't as bad as you pretend to be.

LEVI
Are you sure about that?

MONICA
Pretty sure.

LEVI
Do you know what I do for a living?

MONICA
Yeah.

LEVI
What?

MONICA

You sell stocks or something...

LEVI
Wrong!

He runs his finger down her arm and over to her necklace.
LEVI (CONT'D)
I look for things I want...and I take
them.
She smiles...

Travis sips his beer, takes a deep breath, turns...

INT. BILLY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

Billy slowly wakes up, rubs his head, has a huge hangover.

He gets out of bed.

Billy shakes his head.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP -- DAY

Across the street we see Mike, sitting in his parked car.

Billy sits down in a booth, sipping coffee...suddenly...Mike
slides into the seat across from him.

Billy looks startled, Mike immediately whips out his F.B.I.

badge...

MIKE

Mike Northcut. F.B.I.

BILLY
Hi...is there a problem?

MIKE
No. Just wanted to ask you
questions.

BILLY
About what?

MIKE
The Phoenix Group.

BILLY
Well, we're a brokerage.

MIKE

Why don't you live in New York?

BILLY

We haven't made the move yet, but
with today's technology we can handle

business all over the world

MIKE
What do you know about insider
trading?

BILLY
I know enough.

MIKE
What about front-running?

BILLY
Are you investigating us?

MIKE
Just pickin' at the scaba little bit.
I'll keep this brief. You give us any
information that may lead to an
arrest, you obtain complete
immunity.

He takes out a business card and slides it over to him.

MIKE (CONT'D)
That's my number.

Billy takes it.

He calmly

MIKE (CONT'D)
I don't know what you guys have going
on...but whatever it is, you can be
sure that you will be caught
eventually-

BILLY
-Let me cut you off right there, sir.

sips his coffee.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Our profession is legitimate and we
have the referrals to prove it.
There's a reason the SEC isn't on our
backs.

MIKE
They have thousands of registered
traders to worry about-
BILLY
-You want my contact list of
investors? You can have it. Every
one of them will tell you about the
deposits they get from us every
month.

MIKE
But is it bigger than their
investment is my question.

BILLY
Well, Mr...

MIKE
Northcut.

BILLY

Northcut. Why don't you write me a
check and find out?

MIKE

BILLY
No? Okay, then, if you wanna talk
further, you know where to find
me...at the fuckin' coffee shop
trying to fuckin' relax. Good
day to you.

He slides out and walks away. Mike seems frustrated.
EXT. COFFEE SHOP --

Billy walks quickly down the street. He's thinking hard,
breathing hard, stops in his tracks, and looks back in the
direction of the coffee shop. He bites his bottom lip, annoyed.

INT. ANDREW'S OFFICE -- DAY
Andrew is on the phone, having a consultation with a lead...

ANDREW
Sir, we are in the business of
making money. That's what we do.
Would you like to talk to some of my
other clients? To confirm the
returns they're getting as we speak?
Billy walks in, Andrew holds up his hand.

ANDREW (CONT'D)

I understand. Well, then let me
talk to your wife about it. (pause)
Yes, that's fine. Call anytime.
(pause) But Rick, remember, you're
dealing with the champs here. You're
dealing with Andrew Thomas! If you
were smart, you'd tell your wife that
if she wants that anniversary in the
Bahamas this year, you should do
something with your money and allow
us to help you. (pause) Okay, Rick.
I'1l have my phone on me at all times.
Bye now.

He hangs up, then holds his cell phone like a gun, pointing it
at Billy.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
We are in the old west, Billy. And
this here, is my damn pistol.

He spins it around in his hand.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
We're the cowboys, baby. Modern age
cowboys.

Billy comes over and sits down across from Andrew.
Andrew sits down and starts doing some paperwork.

BILLY
We are in the desert.

ANDREW
And I have the quickest draw in the
West.

LEVI

Faster than Levi?

ANDREW
Eh. So what's up?

A beat.
BILLY
Andrew...I was down gettin' some
coffee this morning...and some
F.B.I. official approached me.

Andrew freezes, looks up at him.

ANDREW
What?

BILLY
He wanted me to give him information
and said that I'd get total immunity
and all this shit.

He takes out Mike's business card and flips it onto Andrew's
desk.

BILLY (CONT'D)
They're investigating us, man.
They're onto us!

ANDREW
Calm down.
(a beat)
See, we're making money now. Lots of
money. And people don't like that.
They don't wanna see young guys
making more than they do.

BILLY
He was like "you're gonna get
caught."
Andrew ponders...
ANDREW

This is okay. He wants to talk to
someone? Send him up to my office
next time this guy approaches you.

BILLY
You sure about that?

ANDREW
Yes. There's nothing to pin on us.

BILLY
This just got me thinking...I don't
know...how long...
He stops. Andrew leans in...

ANDREW
Say what you wanna say, c'mon.

BILLY
I don't wanna get caught, Andrew.

ANDREW
Knock that off, right now!

BILLY
I just-

ANDREW
-First off, you knew what you were
getting into when you got involved.
You have to believe one hundred
percent in this or it falls
through...or the pyramid crumbles.

BILLY
I know, I know...this guy...just kind
of shook me up a little bit. Before
I thought we were untouchable-

Suddenly, Levi walks in...

LEVI
Andrew, you call that last lead?

He sees the mood...

LEVI (CONT'D)
What's wrong?

ANDEW
(bluntly)
Billy wants to quit.

What?! No...I...

Levi looks at him sternly...

LEVI
You wanna fucking quit?

BILLY
No, I just said...
ANDREW
Tell him what you just told me.

Billy nervously stands up, takes a deep breath...

BILLY
The fuckin' F.B.I. talked to me, man.
F.B.I.
Levi contemplates...
LEVI

What'd you say to them?

BILLY
It was just one guy. I told him to
fuck off, what'd you think?!

LEV
Okay, okay...this is fine. I don't
know what triggered this but this is

fine.

BILLY
And I didn't say I wanna quit, I just
said...

LEVI

Well, I'll clear that up for you right
now...this is amafia, Bill. And like
all mafias, you can't quit, you
can't...it's for life. Blood in,
blood out kind of thing.

BILLY
I would never think about quitting.

LEVI
Remember, we are defining the 21st
century right now, as we speak. We
are defining the age of technology
with this. Jesse James, remember?

BILLY
I know, I know.

LEVI
So are you cool?

BILLY
Yeah.

LEVI
You're cool?

BILLY
Yeah.

LEVI
Okay...now...let's make some phone
calls, huh?

BILLY
Yeah.

Billy gets up and walks out of the room.
LEVI
And that F.B.I. official approaches
you again, you tell him Levi wants to
talk to him!

Andrew picks up Mike's business card on his desk and stares at
it.

EXT. NORTHCUTT’s MODEST HOME — EVENING

Mike parks his car in the driveway, grabs his briefcase and
wanders over the front door.

INT. NORTHCUTT’s MODEST HOME —
MIKE
Becky?!

He tosses his suitcase onto the living room couch, takes off
his jacket and heads into the kitchen.

He calls out again...
MIKE (CONT'D)
Becky?! You home?!

He pauses, waits for an answer, and then quickly opens up a
cabinet drawer and takes out a handle of Jack Daniels. He grabs
a glass and starts pouring. A smile comes on his fact, he stops
pouring, takes a big swig.

It doesn’t go down smooth and he winces.
We HEAR footsteps from the other room...

Mike quickly tries to hide the alcohol but Becky turns the corner
and sees him.

BECKY
Hey, honey, are-

Mike freezes.
BECKY (CONT'D)
I thought you were quitting?

MIKE
Baby...I had a rough, rough, day. A tough,
tough day.

BECKY

A promise is a promise, Mike.

MIKE
I know, I know. Look—I haven’t had
a cig in weeks. Can’t we take this
one at a time?

BECKY
It was your idea to quit! I agreed
of course, but you can’t just back
out of it.

MIKE
Your right. Well, how about I quit
next week? I need something to keep
me going. I need something to keep
my blood boiling.

He walks over to her and puts his hands on his shoulders.

MIKE (CONT'D)
I’m chasing some bad people right now.
But I don’t think anyone believes me.
They think I’m wrong..but I’m not..and I’m
gonna prove it.

BECKY
So you get to drink because of that?

MIKE
(smiling)
Yes.
INT. CASINO -- NIGHT
Travis is playing hold'em.

Billy wanders up behind him...

BILLY
Hey Travis, I think I'm taking off,
okay?

TRAVIS
Yeah, yeah.

BILLY
You gonna taxi home?

TRAVIS
Sure. (to the table) Ten thousand.

Travis stacks some chips and slides them into the middle of the
table.

A few other players fold, but finally, this other guy calls
him...

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
Got some action, okay.

The DEALER starts flipping over the cards, and finally, Travis
wins.

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
Fuck yeah!

Travis jumps up and starts pumping his fist, celebrating way
more than he should.

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
Too bad, baby, time to walk!

The other PLAYER is getting annoyed by this taunting.

PLAYER
Go fuck yourself!
TRAVIS
Oh, you gonna cry little baby? You
a little baby? C'mon, you set
yourself up for that shit.

The Player makes a bee line for Travis and gets up in his face.

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
Chill the fuck out.

PLAYER
You're lucky I don't break your nose
right now.

Travis scowls and looks away...

TRAVIS
Can someone get this guy a piece of
gum, fuck.

The Player shoves Travis in the chest and he flies back! The
rest of the players get up and try to break it up. Travis flies
back at him but is stopped by Billy.
TRAVIS (CONT'D)

You better watch your back! I fuckin'

know people man! I could buy you

right now! You

know how much money I have?! Huh?!
The scuffle continues, Billy thrown in the middle of it.

A young female REAL ESTATE AGENT leads Andrew and Heather up
to a beautiful home...

REAL ESTATE AGENT
I think you’ll love this one.

Andrew grabs Heathers hand, they smile at each other.
INT. MANSION —
They wander into the home and it is gorgeous to say the least.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
This was actually just put on the market.
Perfect for a young, rich couple like
yourself.

She laughs.
ANDREW
How do you know we’re rich? Do I smell
like money or something?
He smiles and sniffs his shirt as a joke.
REAL ESTATE AGENT
I think I know when you asked to look
at houses in the two to five million
dollar range!
ANDREW
Yes of course.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
How long have you been married?

ANDREW
We're not.
REAL ESTATE AGENT
Oh, how long have you been engaged?
They don’t say anything, awkward moment, until...
HEATHER
This place is beautiful.
Heather walks out and over to the kitchen. Andrew follows...

REAL ESTATE AGENT
I’1l give you a chance to check it out.
They wander away from her and over into the kitchen.
INT. KITCHEN, MANSION —

HEATHER
Do you like it?

ANDREW
I like the kitchen. But if this place
has any secret passageways I’m signing
today!

Suddenly, his phone rings.

ANDREW (CONT’D)
I gotta take this.

HEATHER
I thought you said you weren’t gonna
answer your phone?

ANDREW
Baby, please, I have to. This is
important.

HEATHER

Well so is this!

Andrew looks back and forth at Heather and then his phone, back
and forth and finally he whips open his phone.

ANDREW
Hey...yeah..what’s up?

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, OFFICE BUILDING --

Levi, Andrew, and Billy sit around a conference table...all
looking very serious.

Suddenly, Travis walks into the room, kind of dishevled, wearing
his suit.

TRAVIS
Sorry I'm late.

The others look at each other.
Travis takes his seat.
They all look at him. Travis feels uncomfortable...

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
What?

No one says anything.

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
What's wrong?

Levi leans forward.

LEVI
We need to talk to you.

TRAVIS
Yeah, about what?

LEVI
You're drawing too much attention to
yourself...to us.

TRAVIS
What are you talking about?

LEVI
I don't wanna lecture you,
Travis...but...we don't need any
extra attention from anyone. People
hear you talking about how much money
you have, they're going to start
getting interested into where that
money is coming from.

TRAVIS
Our cover is completely credible.

ANDREW
It doesn't matter, Travis. We can't
seem reckless.

TRAVIS
You a little tattle-tale, Bill?

LEVI
Leave him out of this.

TRAVIS
Okay, so what do you want me to say?!

LEVI
Just take it easy for a little bit.

ANDREW
Just be smart. Use common sense.

Travis takes a deep breath.

TRAVIS
Shit...alright, fine. You gonna take
my gambling priviledges away too?

LEVI
Gamble all you fuckin' want. Lose
your entire share if it makes you
happy.

TRAVIS
You know what, fuck you, Levi. You
always act like you're the leader,
but let me tell you something, there
is no fucking leader!

INT. HALLWAY, OFFICE BUILDING --

As they're arguing, Richard wanders up the hallway, going over

to ask them a question.
He hears Travis shouting, and stops by the door.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, OFFICE BUILDING --

LEVI
You wanna be in charge, Travis?

TRAVIS
That's my fucking point! No one is
in charge! We're a fucking team!

ANDREW
Travis, just chill out.

TRAVIS
We get busted, we all go down
together. Together. No one is
different here. And I might as well
point something else out...this
whole fucking scam was my idea! The
fake accounts, the Ponzi scheme!

BILLY
Quiet down.

LEVI
Sit your ass back down and shut your
mouth!

TRAVIS

I was the one who thought this shit
up, man! And don't forget it!

INT. OFFICE BUILDING --

Richard is listening closely now, looks confused, squints. He
passes over the doorway, blocking a little bit of light going
into the room.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, OFFICE BUILDING --

The guys continue to argue as Billy watches the doorway...sees
the light in the doorway kind of flickering because of Richard.
He watches more closely and finally jumps up and rips open the
door. He sees Richard, grabs him and throws him into the room.

TRAVIS
What the-

Immediately Andrew and Billy toss him into a chair. They all
gather around him...

LEVI
What the fuck did you just hear?!

Richard is freaked out...

RICHARD
Nothing, nothing. I was just walking
by.

LEVI
Bullshit!

Travis wanders away, rubbing his head in frustration.

ANDREW
Richard...be smart here...tell us
what you heard.
RICHARD
I...I didn't...hear anything.

BILLY
You're lying, Richard.

LEVI
How long were you standing there?

RICHARD
Just for like...a minute.

LEVI
A minute! You can hear a lot ina
minute, Richard.

ANDREW
Dammit!
Andrew walks away.
Levi contemplates...
LEVI

We gotta kill him.

RICHARD
What?!

He tries to jump up but Billy and Andrew grab him again and hold
his arms behind his back as he continues to squirm.

Levi bends down right in front of his face.

LEVI
Richard...tell me...what would you
do right now?

RICHARD
I...I...don't...

LEVI
I'm sorry. We have to kill you.

RICHARD
I don't care what you're doing, I
dont...I won't tell anyone...

ANDREW
So you did hear something!
RICHARD
Just the end.

LEVI
Tell me what you heard, Richard. Tell
me what you heard and we'll think
about not killing you.

RICHARD
I just...

ANDREW
Time to talk, c'mon.

RICHARD
I just heard Travis, say, the thing
about the fake accounts.

Travis turns to the group...

TRAVIS
You're right...we do have to kill
him.

RICHARD

Guys, guys, please...

LEVI
I'm gonna go get my gun, I'll be right
back.

He turns for a moment...

ANDREW
Wait a second.

BILLY
You have a gun?

LEVI
Hell yeah I have a gun.

BILLY
Why?

LEVI
For shit like this, what you think?

BILLY
You're just gonna shoot him right
here?

LEVI
Yes! One shot and it's done.

He holds his hand like a gun and points it at Richard AND FIRES
IT LIKE A GUN AND WE SEE RICHARD IN A DREAMLIKE SEQUENCE BEING
SHOT, BUT THEN WE QUICKLY CUT BACK TO REALITY AND SEE HE'S STILL
ALIVE.

ANDREW
What would we do with the body?

LEVI
We'll carry his ass outta here and
dump it somewhere.

CUT TO DREAM SEQUENCE -- THE FOUR GUYS CARRYING RICHARD'S DEAD
BODY THROUGH THE HALLS -- QUICKLY CUT BACK TO REALITY.

ANDREW
Hold on. Let's figure this out first.

LEVI
There's nothing to figure out! He
knows! He knows! He knows! He knows!
He leaves this room and we're all
dead!

RICHARD
Who am I gonna tell?-

LEVI
-Richard, shut up!

BILLY
How about we just...

LEVI
Just what?

BILLY
I don't know. This is tough.

LEVI
No, this isn't tough. This is an easy
decision in my book.

ANDREW
You don't think anyone's gonna be
curious why he disappeared?

LEVI
Not if we do it right.

RICHARD
Everyone knows I work here...people
will know what happened...

Levi jumps back over to Richard and talks an inch from his
face...

LEVI
Say one more word...c'mon...say one
more...

Richard freezes.
Levi goes back over to Andrew.

ANDREW
We can't kill him. The F.B.I.'s all
over us right now anyway, we don't
need to give them another reason to
talk to us.

Levi looks back over at Richard...

LEVI
How about this...

He walks over to him, talks in a quiet, calm voice...

LEVI (CONT'D)
If you tell anyone, if...if...if...
you better fuckin' run...you better
find a fuckin' rock and hide behind
it for the rest of your life because
I will hunt you down...I will hunt you
down Richard...got it?

RICHARD
Got it, yeah.

LEVI
You gonna say anything?

RICHARD
No, of course not.
LEVI

No?

RICHARD
No.

LEVI
No?

RICHARD
No.

LEVI

Alright...now...go back to work.
Richard gets up and runs out of the room.
They all look at each other.

BILLY
This is a problem.

ANDREW
I think we should like...tap his
phones or something...

Levi nods...

LEVI
Not a bad idea.

A beat.
Travis looks over at them...

TRAVIS
Sorry guys...nothing like that will
ever happen again...

LEVI
Damn right.

There's an awkward tension in the room.
CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN, ANDREW'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

CLOSE-UP ON -- A stereo plays a SONG.
Heather is in the kitchen, moving to the beat as she reaches
into a cabinet and pulls out a bottle of wine. She hums to the
song, uncorks the bottle, and pours a glass of wine.

Andrew wanders in behind her, watches her for a moment...
She turns and is startled by him...

HEATHER
Oh shit, Andrew. You scared me.

Andrew is still wearing his suit, but his tie is undone. He
smiles at her.

ANDREW
What's that?

HEATHER
Wine.

ANDREW
I know it's wine. What year?

HEATHER
Oh.

She examines the bottle.
HEATHER (CONT'D)
Ninety five...Napa Valley...pinot.
I thought it would add a little
something to the meal.

She nods toward the kitchen table. She's prepared a nice dinner
for both of them.

Andrew smiles, but clearly exhausted from the day.
INT. DINING ROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE -- LATER

They sit across from each other, not saying much, but making
eye contact here and there.

HEATHER
How was work today?

A beat.

ANDREW
Okay.
HEATHER
Just okay? That's it?

ANDREW
It was...interesting. Everyday is
interesting working with those guys.

HEATHER
Working with those psychos?

ANDREW
Hey, those are my business partners
you're talking about.

HEATHER
I've met your business
partners...and they're psychos.

ANDREW
As psycho as wanting to bury a million
dollars in the ground?

HEATHER
No, that's strategy.

ANDREW
Strategy?

HEATHER
Yes! You're gonna thank me for that
one day!

ANDREW
Yeah, okay.

HEATHER
Are you in a bad mood?

ANDREW
No.

HEATHER
No?

ANDREW

No. I'm fine.

HEATHER
Well, is something wrong?
ANDREW
I'm just stressed out...very, very
stressed out.

HEATHER
I'm sorry.

ANDREW

It's getting harder and harder to
kind of...turn off work...in my head.
It's hard to come home and not think
about all the stuff I had to go
through...and all the stuff I have to
deal with tomorrow...and the next
day...it just keeps...building...

HEATHER
Do you need help with anything?

ANDREW
(smiles)
No, but thank you.

HEATHER
So why don't you take a little
vacation?

ANDREW
I can't...this job...making the type
of money I'm trying to make...is an
all-day, everyday endeavor...it
never stops...

They look at each other and sit in silence...
MUSIC COMES IN AND CONTINUES TO PLAY OVER...

CUT TO:
MONTAGE:

We show a bunch of scenes where all of our guys are talking on
the phones with investors, closing deals, Levi pacing the call
room, Monica half-naked in bed as Levi walks into the room,

Andrew and Billy shaking hands with other investors, Andrew and
Heather kissing in bed, Travis collecting more chips at the

casino, the montage ends with the four guys sitting in chairs,
smoking cigars, the image of success.
Taking us to...
INT. CIGAR LOUNGE -- DAY

They're all sitting in oversized, brown, leather chairs,
smoking cigars at this low key lounge...

LEVI
Gentlemen--We have tripled our
client roster.

ANDREW
Now be smart with what you spend your
money on.

BILLY
Yeah.

TRAVIS

Why you looking at me?

ANDREW
Nothing.

TRAVIS
Yeah I bet. Well, when we first
started this thing, I honestly
thought it'd be difficult.

LEVI
Sayin' shit like that's gonna fuckin'
jinx us, man!

TRAVIS
What?
LEVI
You could've just jinxed us right
now!
TRAVIS
Please.
LEVI

You don't believe in a jinx?

TRAVIS
No, I don't.

LEVI
Do you Billy?

BILLY
Yup.

LEVI
Andrew?

ANDREW
Yeah.

LEVI
See!

TRAVIS

Well, I hope you don't believe
in karma too, cuz then we're all
dead men walking.

He smiles.

LEVI
I'm more inclined to believe ina
jinx then some motherfuckin' karma.

TRAVIS
How is it different?

LEVI
It just is...

BILLY
It's not that different, Levi.

LEVI
Okay, I'm sorry I brought it up.

TRAVIS
So...what'd you say we fly out to
Vegas this weekend?

ANDREW
I'd be down.

BILLY
Yeah!

LEVI
I don't know. We gotta lot of work
to do.
TRAVIS
Do we though? Honestly?

LEVI
You wanna go to Vegas? Go. I don't
care. I'm gonna work.

TRAVIS
Okay, fine.

ANDREW
Actually, I can't.

TRAVIS
Why not?

ANDREW
Heather's parents are visiting.

BILLY
That's gettin' pretty serious, huh?

ANDREW
I'm not gonna lie...but...I think
I want to marry her.

LEVI
Okay, okay, we don't need to hear this
shit, Andrew.

ANDREW
I'm just telling the truth. You don't
wanna hear about my personal life?

LEVI
No, I don't.

BILLY
Well, I say congrats, Andrew.

ANDREW
Thanks, Billy.

TRAVIS
Yeah, Levi's just jealous cuz' he
wanted Andrew all for himself.

Levi flicks him off.

The others laugh.
cut TO:
INT. CASINO -- NIGHT

Travis wanders up to the outside of the casino, smoking a
cigarette. He puts it out and walks inside.

He heads over to the cashier...and slaps down a huge wad of
money, wrapped in a rubber band. The CASHIER looks at it, looks
up at him strangely...Travis smiles.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

Mike and CHARLES DOWNS, another F.B.I. agent, are briefing
WALTER JACOBS, a former official, on a meeting with the Phoenix
Group.

Charles is strapping a recording device to Walter's chest.

MIKE
Make sure you stay calm and keep
asking questions.

WALTER
Just because I'm retired doesn't mean
I don't remember how to do this shit.

CHARLES
Your name is Jonathan Mitchell.

WALTER
Jonathan, okay.

Walter has a cocktail on the table next to him, grabs it and
takes a swig.

CHARLES
Should you be drinking before this?

WALTER
I'mfine. I need to loosen upa little
bit. Take the edge off, the fuckin'
nerves.

MIKE
Try to see if they'll let you onto
a trial account on their website.

WALTER
At what point do I cut off the
conversation?

MIKE
Keep it going as long as possible.
Try to set up another meeting. Try
to get some referrals.

CHARLES
You need to get referrals. Try to get
a list of everyone they have
investing.

WALTER
Why the fuck would they give me that?

MIKE
Because...they're trying to gain
credibility. They're trying to get
you to trust them.

CHARLES
At least get one.

MIKE
Say you want to follow up and get a
first hand account of their services.

Walter chugs the rest of his drink.

WALTER
Showtime.

ELEVATOR, OFFICE BUILDING --

Levi, Billy and Andrew all walk into the elevator.

LEVI
Where's Travis?

They all look at each other...

BILLY
I don't know.

LEVI
Fuck.

ANDREW
It's fine. We don't need him.
LEVI
Who do we got right now?

ANDREW
Some CEO of...an accounting
firm...Jonathan Mitchell.

LEVI
We background check this guy?

They don't respond.

LEVI (CONT'D)
Jesus! We let anyone walk up in here
now? Background check, background
check!

ANDREW
He seemed credible and usually that's
Travis' job.

LEVI
Travis is a fuck up, so let's not use
that excuse.

The elevator doors open and they quickly rush over to a
conference room.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM --
They walk in and sitting down is Walter.
He gets up and shakes their hands...

WALTER
Gentlemen, how do you do?

EVERYONE
Good.

They all shake.
INT. WHITE SURVEILLANCE VAN -- SAME TIME

Mike and Charles are sitting in front of a large recording
device, each listening on headphones.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM --

LEVI
So how you feeling today Mr.
Mitchell?

WALTER
Good, good...

LEVI
You feel like making money today?

WALTER
Today?!

LEVI
Well, are you ready to start the
process of making money? Cuz' that
can happen right now, yes.

WALTER
(smiling)
You gonna buy me dinner before you try
to fuck me?

ANDREW
Walter...how much do you know about
us and what we do?

WALTER
A little...I saw the website.

BILLY
The website doesn't let you know who
we are. How we work. You can only
determine that by meeting like we are
right now.

WALTER
What are your names again?

LEVI
Levi, Andrew, and that's Billy.
We're basically brothers here.

WALTER
Brothers, huh? Don't look like
brothers.

LEVI
As far as you're concerned we are.
Our company is a family of
like-minded individuals dedicated to
prospering in a vicious and
competitive world. We look out for
each other...like brothers...

we have each other's backs...like
brothers...and we trust each
other...like brothers. If you invest
with us, you will be treated in the
same fashion.

WALTER
Well, what concerns me is...I want to
know where my money is going.

LEVI
We don't reveal who we invest with,
or what stocks we buy, but you can see
the allocation of funds, per month,
and also track the returns.

WALTER
Why can't I see where my money is
going?

ANDREW
Because then you become a critic, a
referee. We don't want you to judge
our expertise, or for that matter,
spread any information about what
stocks we feel are quality.

WALTER
I guess that makes sense.

BILLY
Of course it makes sense.

WALTER
I'm still skeptical though.

LEVI

There's nothing to be skeptical
about, sir. It's not like we're gonna
take your money, kidnap you, carry
you into the woods, chop your body up
into little pieces, cover each limb
with honey and then wait for the
wolves to show up.
Walter looks at him strangely...an awkward moment...until
everyone starts laughing.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING -- LATER

Mike paces the room. Charles is sitting down ona stool. Walter
is taking off his recording device.

Mike rubs

A beat.

WALTER
You know, there's a chance they could
be legitimate.

MIKE
No way.

WALTER
Why is that not possible?

MIKE
Trust me.

WALTER
I wanna know, Mike. Why is that not
possible? What's with the vendetta?

MIKE
There's no fucking vendetta!
Alright, yeah, I'm skeptical
sometimes, but you know what I'm
gonna do? I'm going to Mexico...I'm
talking to Tan'el.

CHARLES
You gonna call up his secretary and
ask for a fuckin' appointment?
Forget it.

his head, takes a deep breath.

MIKE
I know what they're doing...I know.
And I'm not stopping until all those
guys are in fuckin' cuffs.

EXT. HOTEL -- DAY

A brand new Ferrari pulls up to the valet at this fancy hotel
in Scottsdale. Levi and Monica step out.

The valet helps Monica out.

Levi walks around and they proceed into the building.

MONICA
What am I supposed to do during this
thing?

LEVI

I don't know.

MONICA
How long is it gonna be?

Levi stops and turns to her...

LEVI
Just hang out in the lobby or
something.

MONICA
I'm not hanging out in the fucking
lobby, Levi.

He quickly whips out his wallet...
LEVI
Alright, just get a room and sit
there.
He hands her his Black Amex.

She smiles...

MONICA
See ya.
He turns and heads to...
INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

Levi walks into the conference room where a small camera crew
has set up two chairs, clearly prepared for an interview of some
kind.

A young JOURNALIST greets him, wearing a slick suit.

JOURNALIST
Levi Charles -- Thank you so much for
agreeing to this.

LEVI
My pleasure.

JOURNALIST
Lot of business majors dying to hear
some of your secrets.

LEVI
Well, I don't think I'm giving away
too many of those today.
He laughs.

JOURNALIST
It'd be a good story.

LEVI
But seriously. I love reaching out
to people and I'mthrilled to do this.

JOURNALIST
Well, in that case, let's get going.

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM — MOMENTS LATER
They begin the interview...
JOURNALIST
Where did you go to college?

LEVI
Cornell, Business School.
JOURNALIST
How old are you?
LEVI
People think I look young..and that’s

because I am.I’m twenty eight years old.

JOURNALIST
And that’s what makes your story so

intriguing.

INT. ANDREW'S APARTMENT -- DAY

Heather is sleeping in bed. Andrew crawls up next to her. He's
holding something in his hands.

He kisses her on the cheek, waking her up. She readjusts herself
toward him.

She opens

Baby...wake up...I have something I
want to tell you.

HEATHER
Tell me.

ANDREW
You have to look at me.

HEATHER
Yes...

Levi and the Journalist have started their interview...

LEVI
Success is a product of desire. A
desire to have the things you want,
to live the way you want to live, to
be the person you want to be. The
people that succeed, that fight for
that success, they have those
qualities.

INT. ANDREW'S APARTMENT --

ANDREW

I'm doing really well right now...as
you probably know...everything in my
life is perfect. In this moment
everything is exactly how it should
be...except for one thing...one
thing isn't complete yet...one thing
isn't right yet...yet...

HEATHER
Yet...?

ANDREW
I wanna give you my last name...

He takes out a massive diamond engagement ring...

She rolls

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Will you marry me?

HEATHER
Oh my god!

ANDREW
(laughing)
Is that a yes?

over onto him and they start kissing.

LEVI (V.0.)
I believe the new generation, the
eighties babies, we have that strong
desire flowing through our veins.

INT. F.B.I. OFFICE -- NIGHT

Mike sits

at his desk, reading over a bunch of documents about

the Phoenix Group. He leans back in his chair and stretches.
He looks exhausted.
LEVI (V.O.)
We are a spoiled generation and we
want to keep it that way. Our parents
didn't have fuckin' cell phones, the
internet!

EXT. ADAMS' HOME -- DAY

Billy, his father, and his mother, MRS. ADAMS, wander out of
the house.

Both his parents have their eyes closed and Billy

is leading them outside.

BILLY
Keep them closed!

MR. ADAMS
Fuck, Bill, I'm gonna hit something.

He leads them over to the driveway and sets them up in
of a brand new MERCEDES with a giant bow around it.

LEVI (V.0.)
We have a new way of life that we are
trying to sustain.

BILLY
Okay...open!

MRS. ADAMS
Oh my god!

BILLY
You like it?!

MR. ADAMS
What's this?

BILLY
A gift.

You didn't have to do this, Billy!

BILLY
I wanted to.

MRS. ADAMS
Wasn't that sweet?

MR. ADAMS
You afford this?

BILLY
Yeah. I wanted to do somethin'
special for you guys.

MR. ADAMS
Well, thank you, thank you...

BILLY
I expected a little more excitement
outta you.

MR. ADAMS
I'm excited...yeah...I mean...I have
my SUV...I love that
thing...but...momma will drive
it...won't you?

MRS. ADAMS
Of course I will!

BILLY
Well, good.

MRS. ADAMS
Maybe we should start investing with
you, huh?

Billy sheepishly grins...

BILLY
Yeah, maybe...

LEVI (V.0.)
And yet, it's survival of the
fittest.

INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

LEVI
You have to fight for every breath out
there. Everyone in business is out
for themselves. Including me.

Well, you have business partners,
don't you?

LEVI
Ethics are overrated.

LEVI (CONT'D)
I'm just kidding. No I'mnot. Yes,
Iam. Okay...my advice? Find your
niche.

JOURNALIST
Does it ever get stressful knowing
that you are in control and in charge

of millions and millions of dollars...

of other people’s money.

Levi stares back at him, a slight grin on his face...

The journalist stays relentless...

JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
And how have you managed to stay so
consistent in your investments? Is it true

you guarantee returns?

LEVI

There is no way to guarantee returns.
Who told you that?

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

Mike is standing in front of a projector screen in this small
conference room.

Peter Donnelly is standing in the back of the room with his arms
crossed.

Mike is explaining what he thinks our guys are doing...

MIKE
Basically...what I believe...is that
it's a form of online banking, but
they use their own program and their
own database. For instance, if
someone gives them one hundred
thousand dollars, they create an
“account" for this person. With this
"account" the investor can check
their balance, can check
their gains, losses etc. But what I
believe they're doing...is setting
up invisible money. This
account...this number...is just
that...a number. It has no monetary
representation. They actually
deposit the investment into their own
account.

OFFICIAL
Then how do they give returns to their
investors?

MIKE

Well, that's it right there. They're
feeding money from investor to
investor. In achain. So when they
give their investors the returns,
they are actually depositing money
into that person's account, but it is
only a small percentage of what that
person invested. So technically, as
long as the investor never decides to
walk away, they could be funneling
their own money back to them forever.
The group

PETER
Now, is any of this information
backed up? Confirmed?

MIKE
It's just speculation at this point,
sir.
sighs.

PETER

Don't bother us anymore with
speculation...get some facts.
Alright, who's next?!

Peter walks down the aisle toward the front of the room.

Mike starts breathing hard, getting more and more frustrated
until he bursts out...

MIKE
I’m not done!

Peter pauses in his tracks.

PETER
What?

MIKE
I’m not done! This is priority! This
is a high-technology crime! Maybe you’re
not briefed enough on this material
Peter but let me tell you..this is the
twenty-first century and the biggest
wars we have are the cyber-wars!

Addressing the rest of the officials in the room...

PETER
Please cover your ears--I’m about
to start cussing now.

(a beat)
Sit your fucking ass over in that
motherfucking chair Northcutt!

Mike pauses and then walks over to his chair and sits down.
Peter wanders over to the projector screen, examines it and
turns around.
PETER
First off, you ever call me Peter
again and I’ll rip your nose off your
fucking face. You address me as “sir”
or you address me as Mister Donnelly.
I may be attractive and youthful but I have earned
my status as “Mister.”
You got that?

Mike doesn’t react.

PETER
Issue number two..we are not in the business
of skepticism Mike. We are in the business
of fact. And I like facts. Facts don’t
fucking lie, and the only facts you have
right now, Mike, Mike Northcutt, is that
you are a novice fucking official that
enjoys raising his voice to heads of criminal
investigative divisions.

(he begins pacing the aisles)

A man is shot with a bullet equals fact.
A car crashes into a telephone pole equals
fact. Tears are wet, fire is hot, ice is cold, fact,
fact, and fact. You have no facts son,
you have skepticism and the world is not
run that way and neither is the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. This may be the wrong
Unit for you. Maybe you should transfer
to Cyber Division and handle internet
Fraud? You know where they’re stationed?
(changing tones) Do you wanna know where
they’re stationed? You want to be in the
criminal investigative division? This division? You
need to do some criminal investigating.
You need to get tangible evidence. So let
me say it one more time, Mikey, and I hope you can
contain your tears. Don’t bother us again with
speculation—get some facts.

(he heads toward the door)
Now all of you go turn your teeth into
fucking fangs and start making some arrests.

INT. CALL ROOM -- DAY
We travel around the call room, listening to different pitches
from telemarketers. We end on Richard, as he sits there, staring
forward, looking kind of nervous. Behind him...Levi stands in
the doorway with his arms crossed.

After a moment, we suddenly see Andrew rush down the hallway...

ANDREW
Levi!

Levi turns.

LEVI
What's wrong?

ANDREW
Tan'el's on the phone...it's not
good.

INT. OFFICE --
Levi rushes into Andrew's office, picks up the phone...

LEVI
Mr. Garcia! How are you?

INT. RANCH -- SAME TIME

Tan'el paces back and forth in his living room, talking to them
on his cell phone.

TAN'EL
Not good, not good.

LEVI
Why?

TAN'EL
I know I promised to invest but...I'm
sorry...I need my money back...

INT. OFFICE --
Levi mouths "shit" and sits down in Andrew's chair.

LEVI
Can you explain why?

TAN'EL
I understand if you've already
invested some of it...that's
fine...keep it...but...the rest of
the capitol I need back.

LEVI
You gettin' cold feet? C'mon, what
changed?

TAN'EL

I had a few...deals...that...got
fucked up...I lost some money. I'm
not trying to dance around this, I
need my money back.

LEVI
Well, just so you know, we're looking
at some big returns very soon for you.
We plan on tripling your money!

TAN'EL
That's all good, but, at this moment,
I'm putting together something that
requires the extra money...I will
eventually be able to reinvest with
you gentlemen, but right now...

LEVI
Okay, okay. How about this? Let me
and my partners come back down there,
down to Mexico-

Andrew shoots him an awkward look.

LEVI (CONT'D)
And we'll sit down with you and work
out how we can continue our business
together.

Tan'el takes a deep breath...

TAN'EL
Well...I don't know if it'll change
anything...but...you wanna come down
to my city? I won't turn you away.

LEVI
Then we're getting on a plane right
now. You're important to us Mr.
Garcia. You're our most important
client and we don't want to lose
your business. (pause) Okay, sir.
See you soon. Bye.
He hangs up, rubs his head, Andrew is silent.
EXT. RUNWAY -- DAY

Levi and Andrew walk down this private runway and over to their
private plane. They're dressed in nice suits.

Andrew is talking to Travis on the phone...
ANDREW
Where are you? (pause) No, we can’t
wait! You supposed to be here thirty
minutes ago! (pause) Just stay there
with Billy. (pause) Bye.
He hangs up.
ANDREW (CONT’D)
Travis isn’t coming.
LEVI
What are we gonna do with that kid?
ANDREW
He was our connection to Tan’el.
LEVI
Doesn’t matter now.
INT. BILLY'S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
Billy is leaning back in his chair, zoning out. He's taking
pieces of computer paper, crushing them into little balls and
trying to shoot it into the waste basket near the door. He shoots
a few times and misses.

He stretches, takes a deep breath, bored.
EXT. RUNWAY, MEXICO -- DAY
The plane comes to a smooth stop on the runway.

Our guys get out and are met with Tan'el's assistant, standing
next to the same limousine as before.

They all shake his hand and get in.

EXT. RANCH -- DAY

Tan'el is sitting in a lawn chair in the back of the ranch. He's
wearing a wife-beater, smoking a cigar, and shooting a rifle

at a few targets.

He fires...BANG! Misses. He reloads. BANG! BANG! He misses
again.

He squints, trying to see if he hit it or not.

After a moment, our guys turn the corner, being led by the
assistant.

Tan'el hears them and turns...

TAN'EL
Oopa!

LEVI
How you doin' sir?

TAN'EL
Good, good. Where's Travis?

ANDREW
He's back home.

Changing subjects...

LEVI
You a good shot?

Tan'el looks down at his rifle.

TAN'EL
One of the best!

He clearly is terrible.

LEVI
Can I try?

TAN'EL
Sure, sure.

He hands the gun to Levi. Levi grabs it, seems comfortable with
the rifle, walks over in front of the lawn chair, quickly cocks
it, points it at a target...BANG! BANG! BANG! He hits three
straight targets.

Tan'el tries to not look impressed.

TAN'EL (CONT'D)
Good, good. Almost as good as me!

LEVI
I'm trying.

INT. BILLY'S OFFICE -- SAME TIME

Billy is still hanging out in the office. He looks at his watch,
then gets up, grabs his jacket, and leaves.

EXT. RANCH -- DAY

Andrew is holding the gun now, looking down the sight. He
fires...misses...fires...misses.

LEVI
You suck, Andrew.

ANDREW
Shut up.

He lowers the gun...
ANDREW (CONT'D)

This seems like a pretty good
bargaining tool.

TAN'EL
It is, it is. I use it in all my
negotiations!

They laugh.

TAN'EL (CONT'D)
So...you have my money?

Silence...a beat.
Finally...

LEVI
Well, that's why we wanted to come
down here.

ANDREW
We really want you to continue to work
with us.

TAN'EL
I already explained this. I need that
money.

LEVI

Let's try to figure something out
that works for both of us.

Tan'el calmly reaches out for the rifle.
TAN'EL
(quietly)
Can I see that for a moment?
Andrwe hands it to him.

Tan'el quickly grabs it and points it right at Levi's head.

TAN'EL (CONT'D)
Give me my money.

Levi nervously smiles.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET -- SAME TIME
Billy, hands in his pockets, wanders down the street.
He passes a deli, stops, and heads inside.
INT. RANCH -- SAME TIME

TAN'EL
Everyone is a good shot when they're
standing an inch from their target.
I don't think I can miss from here.

ANDREW
Just calm down, calm down.
LEVI
Let's talk about this.

TAN'EL
I made a mistake. I was too quick to
invest with you gentlemen. Too

stupid.

ANDREW
We can make you money. Just give us
time.

TAN'EL

No! If my money is not in my account
by next weekend...I will kill you. Is
that clear? Is that English? I can
tell you in Spanish if you want?

LEVI
Well, this wasn't much of a
negotiation, was it?

TAN'EL
No...

ANDREW
Give us two weeks. And just the rest
of the capitol.

TAN'EL
Why two weeks? Why more time?

ANDREW
We have to organize our accounts.

LEVI
Yeah, crunch some numbers.

TAN'EL
Okay, two weeks.

He lowers the gun and smiles.
INT. DELI -- SAME TIME

Billy looks over the menu, orders, pays, and takes his seat at
a table about ten feet away. He's looking at his cell phone.

As he's looking at his phone, a MAN enters through the front
entrance. Billy hears him, but doesn't look up.
CASHIER
Hey, Walter, how ya doin'?

Billy finally looks up, sees Walter and does a double take. He
recognizes him and realizes he's going by a different name...

BILLY
(smirking)
Hey, Jonathan...

Walter snaps his head over to him, gives a surprised expression
and quickly turns back to the cashier.

Billy flashes a huge smile, knows he was spying on them.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Nice one.

CUT TO:
EXT. RUNWAY -- DAY
Andrew and Levi walk down the runway.
Levi has his phone to his ear...

LEVI
Billy, what's up?

INT. BILLY'S HOUSE -- SAME TIME

BILLY
You guys landed yet?

LEVI
We're just taking off. Be there in
a few hours.

BILLY
Okay...well...when you land...I need
you guys to come over to my house.

LEVI
Why?

BILLY
I'll explain when you get here.

He hangs up.
Levi lowers the cell phone, looks oddly over at Andrew.
EXT. BILLY'S HOUSE --

They walk up to the front door and knock. After only a moment,
Billy rips the door open, he's biting his nails.

BILLY
Hey.

ANDREW
So what's going, Billy?

BILLY
I have to show you something.

The guys look confused. Billy turns and leads them through his
house and over to a bedroom.

They open the door next to him...
INT. BEDROOM -

Sitting there on the far side of the room is Walter, a blindfold
around his eyes, his mouth bleeding, and his arms tied behind
his back.

Andrew quickly slams the door shut again...

ANDREW
What the hell is that?!

BILLY
That's Walter, man.

LEVI
Walter?!

BILLY
He's F.B.I. He was spying on us.

ANDREW
What are you talking about?!

BILLY
Remember Jonathan Mitchell? The
investor of that accounting firm we
met last week?

ANDREW
Yes.

BILLY
That's him!

ANDREW
So why the hell is he tied up in your
house, Billy?

BILLY
I didn't know what to do.

ANDREW
Oh my god.

Andrew walks away, rubs his forehead.

LEVI
Billy, Billy...listen to me for a
second. Did anyone see you bring this
guy here?

BILLY
No way.

LEVI
Are you sure about that?

BILLY
Yes, positive.

ANDREW
What the hell were you thinking?

BILLY
I was thinking I was gonna save our
asses by catching a spy!

ANDREW
This is insane.

LEVI
But Billy...what do we do now, huh?

BILLY
I don't know!

LEVI
Dammit.
ANDREW

Where’s Travis? Does he know about this?
BILLY

He didn’t answer.

LEVI
Billy...I appreciate you looking out
for us. I know you thought this was
the right thing to do, but this was
not the right thing to do. This was
the wrong thing to do.

Billy rubs his eyes.
Andrew opens the door again and studies Walter...

ANDREW
Is he knocked out?

BILLY
Yeah, I think so. I hit him pretty
hard.

LEVI

So let's just dump him somewhere.

ANDREW
Then he'll just come back and arrest
us.

BILLY

No, no. I blindfolded him right away,
he doesn't know where he is.

ANDREW
Will he recognize you from our
company?

BILLY

I don't think so.

ANDREW
You don't think so?

BILLY
Yeah. He only saw me for a moment.
He probably won't remember anything.
Andrew closes the door.

ANDREW
We need to worry about Tan'el right
now, we don't have time to think about
a freaking hostage!

LEVI
Billy's gonna handle this.

BILLY
How?

LEVI
How?

BILLY
Yeah.

LEVI

You're gonna fuckin' dump him back
off somewhere, somewhere in this
desert so no one sees your ass doing
it.

BILLY
walright...okay.

LEVI
Got it?

BILLY
Yeah, got it.

ANDREW
Somebody call Travis!
EXT. DESERT -- EVENING

All is quiet until...Billy's flies by and screeches to a stop.
No one is around.

Billy quickly jumps out and walks around to the side of the car.
He opens the door, grabs Walter by the arms and drags him out
into the desert.

WALTER
What the hell?! You better run!
You're going to jail for a long time,
son!

His blindfold is still on, he has no clue who Billy is...

BILLY
Sure about that?

Billy jumps into the driver's seat and takes off.

Walter tries to get to his feet, but trips and falls.
CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- NIGHT

Our guys sit around the room.

Andrew's pacing back and forth.

Travis is there.

LEVI
Tan'el...

No one says anything.

ANDREW
There's nothing we can do with him.
We have to bite the bullet on this
one. Cut our spending and continue
to push forward, finding more people.
We haven't even asked any clients to
refer us yet. We should work those
connections more.

A beat...

TRAVIS
Tan'el...what if...what if we killed
him...kept the money.

ANDREW
Are you fuckin' serious? Levi get you
on that coke or what?

LEVI
First of all, fuck off. Secondly,
that's not a bad idea, Travis.

Billy doesn't say anything.

ANDREW
Are you insane?!

TRAVIS
You wouldn't kill him for ten million
dollars?

ANDREW

No! What the-where the hell am I?

LEVI
It's definitely intriguing.

ANDREW
Intriguing?! You plan to just walk
in there, say "hey, howya' doin?" and
then cap his ass? You don't think
anyone's gonna have a problem with
that?

LEVI
Well, obviously, we'd be smarter
about it than that.

TRAVIS
What would you do for ten million
dollars, Andrew?

He doesn't respond.
TRAVIS (CONT'D)
(overly articulate)
What would you do for ten million
dollars, Andrew? Tell me.

ANDREW
Shit...I don't know! Not murder!

TRAVIS
Then I'll do it, or Levi, or Billy.

DREAM SEQUENCE:
We see Tan'el smoking a cigar, laughing, and then Levi, Travis
and Billy come up behind him. Levi draws a gun and POINTS IT

AT HIM.

ON THE SOUND OF THE TRIGGER WE CUT BACK TO...

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM --

Silence.

Silence.

TRAVIS
You stay here, be a pussy.

ANDREW
I don't consider that being a pussy
you head-case. I consider that
rational thinking.

LEVI
Travis is right though...you don't
have to be involved.

ANDREW
I'm involved no matter what, so stop
saying that. If I know about it, and
I don't stop it, I'm involved.

TRAVIS
I just don't see any other way.

ANDREW
How about giving him his money back?
(a beat)
We wire him his ten mill, we suck it
up, and move on. We haven't spent
that much of it any way.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Right?

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Look, I gotta get out of here. I'm
not having this conversation.

LEVI
Now you quitting?

Andrew stops...

A beat.
ANDREW
(mockingly)
You can't quit, right? This isa
mafia...blood in...

No one responds.
He leaves.

BILLY
You don't really wanna murder Tan'el,
do you?

Travis leans back in his chair.

TRAVIS
I think it should be an option.

BILLY
I'm worried about Andrew, I am.

LEVI
You don't need to be.

BILLY
I don't know...I mean...I thought
I was feelin' skeptical but
Andrew...I think everything's
starting to get to him. What if he
tells someone?

LEVI
Well, then we'll probably know about
it.

TRAVIS

What do you mean?

LEVI
(frankly)
I tapped his phones and miked his
house.
TRAVIS

What? Are you kidding?

LEVI
No. I'm serious.

BILLY
Why?!

TRAVIS
Wait-You tap my shit?

LEVI
No.

TRAVIS
You're a liar.

LEVI
I didn't, Travis! I trust you.
Andrew, I don't trust. Not lately.

BILLY
I don't like that, man. That's fucked
up.

LEVI

I'm lookin' out for us, okay?

BILLY
When did you tap his phones?

LEVI

Same time I did Richard's. If he's

so trust worthy then we should have

nothing to worry about, right?
Levi's point kind of makes sense.
The group sits in silence.

CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Heather sits on the floor, looking at some CD's.
She pops one into the stereo and turns it upa little bit...as...
Andrew walks in the front door. He's slouching, looks tired.

Heather hears him...

HEATHER
Hey baby.

He wanders into the living room...
ANDREW
What are you doing?

HEATHER
Just listening to some music.

He collapses onto the couch.

ANDREW
Some day, I bet we won't even have
CD's.

HEATHER

What do you mean?

ANDREW
Well, first we had records, then
tapes, now CD's, I mean it's the year
two thousand, I'm sure they're gonna
think of something.

HEATHER
Maybe like a little CD player, but it
has all your music without putting
any CD's in.

ANDREW
That's just crazy.
She laughs.
HEATHER
Whatever.
ANDREW

Wasn't it weird how everyone thought
Y2K was gonna be the end of the world?
Everyone bought all this canned food,
searched for bomb shelters, and then
the clock struck midnight and nothing
fuckin' happened. Nothing. How can
people be so wrong about something?
Just completely wrong.

HEATHER
I was worried.

ANDREW
No way! You were?
HEATHER
A little bit. You weren't?

ANDREW
Nope.

HEATHER
You know, you think you're a tough
guy, but I know you're really just a
big baby.
ANDREW
(playfully)
Dem's fightin' words.

HEATHER
I could take you.

ANDREW
Really, huh?

She gets up and jumps on him.
They wrestle for a moment and it ends with Andrew holding her.
HEATHER
So, where are we having the wedding?
We haven't even decided yet.

Andrew grows serious...

ANDREW
Well...

HEATHER
How about...Jamaica?

He doesn't respond.

HEATHER (CONT'D)
Okay, not Jamaica.

He takes a deep breath.
ANDREW
We might have to push it back for

awhile.

She perks up and turns to him...
HEATHER

Why?

ANDREW
Well...we had some...problems...at
work.

HEATHER

What kind of problems?

ANDREW
We lost some money.

Heather looks concerned.

HEATHER
What happened?

ANDREW
I don't wanna get into it...but...
I just want you to know that I'm
trying to give you the wedding of your
dreams...I wanna make sure it's
perfect. So I'm going to need more
time.

HEATHER
Can you tell me what happened?

He takes another breath...

ANDREW
Remember that big investment we got?
Well, we lost it.

HEATHER
You lost it? How?

ANDREW
We had to give it back.

He gets up and starts pacing, getting increasingly stressed out.
ANDREW (CONT'D)
I really didn't wanna talk about
this.

HEATHER
If we're going to get married, I
deserve to know everything about your
life, don't I?

ANDREW
Yes, but...

HEATHER
You can talk to your wife, Andrew.
What are you hiding?

ANDREW
I'm not hiding anything.

HEATHER
Sure sounds like it.

ANDREW
It's just...complicated...

HEATHER
I want to trust you. I have to trust
you...you have to trust me.

ANDREW
I trust you.

HEATHER
Then tell me what's going on.

He turns to her. He's about to crack.

ANDREW
Everything I do...I'm not
perfect...I've made mistakes...but I
think...I don't know...I'm sick of
being the bad guy.

HEATHER
Bad guy?

ANDREW
What I'm about to tell you, you can't
repeat, you can't question, and I
want you to know that I'm trying to
make it right. Okay?

HEATHER
Okay. You can trust me.
ANDREW
I can trust you?

HEATHER
Of course. I love you.

ANDREW
Well, I'm telling you this because I
love you too. I love you more than
anything.

HEATHER
Just tell me.

He walks over and sits down next to her...

ANDREW
Our company...baby...our company is
a fucking fraud. We don't invest,
we're not stock brokers, we're
frauds! What we do...we take peoples
investments and then pay them back
small portions of their own money
pretending it's their interest. But
there is no fucking interest! We're
spending their money!

HEATHER
But...how...wouldn't you run out?

ANDREW

Not if you keep getting investors!
Especially if the investments keep
getting bigger! And we keep getting
them! Baby...we're stealing their
money! This house is stolen!
Everything in here! Everything I buy
you! It's all a scam, baby!

He gets up and starts pacing.
He notices she's starting to get nervous.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
But Heather...see...the only reason
I'm telling you this is because I'm
gonna stop, I'm quitting, I'm not
gonna be a criminal anymore.
HEATHER
What if someone finds out?

ANDREW
No one's gonna find out, ever. No one
knows. No one will ever know.

HEATHER
I think you should tell someone.

ANDREW
And go to jail?! Are you insane?!

HEATHER
Are they gonna let you just walk away?

Andrew ponders...

ANDREW
No, not exactly. I'm still figuring
that out.

Heather starts to tear up.
ANDREW (CONT'D)

Heather--Don't cry. Everything's
gonna be fine. Really. I promise.

HEATHER
I don't want anything to happen to
you.

ANDREW

Nothing's gonna happen to me.
We're going to be alright.

HEATHER
How are you gonna protect yourself?
A beat.
ANDREW
There is one option...a backup
plan...
HEATHER

What is it?

ANDREW
If all else fails, and I have to get
out, if I need to do something
drastic...

HEATHER
What?

ANDREW
There's this F.B.I. agent that's
been trying to get information from
us. He told us...he told
Billy...that...he'd grant immunity
to anyone who disclosed information
about our company, if it lead to
indictments.
CUT TO:
INT. OFFICE -- SAME TIME!

WE ARE WIDE ON -- LEVI'S OFFICE -- HE SITS BEHIND HIS DESK,
HEADPHONES ON.

WE DOLLY IN ON HIM -- HE'S FROZEN WITH SHOCK, ANGER, AWE...HE
IS LISTENING TO THEIR CONVERSATION THROUGH THE MICROPHONES HE
PLANTED IN ANDREW'S HOUSE.

WE FAINTLY HEAR ANDREW AND HEATHER CONTINUE TO TALK.

WE GET A SENSE THAT LEVI IS GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS...
INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Andrew and Heather lie in bed -- Andrew is awake and staring
up at the ceiling.

cut TO:
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING -- NIGHT

Levi is sitting under a street light, waiting. After a moment,
Travis and Billy wander up.

TRAVIS
So what's this about?

Levi pauses for a moment.

Travis looks around...
TRAVIS (CONT'D)
What the fuck is goin' on?

LEVI
We have a problem with Andrew.

BILLY
What kind of problem?

LEVI
A big problem...a really big problem.

TRAVIS
Like what?

LEVI
I have something I want you to hear.

Levi walks toward the office building.

Travis and Billy look at each, and finally, follow Levi toward
the building.

CUT TO:
INT. BATHROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE -- DAY
He brushes his teeth in front of the mirror, getting ready for
a day of work. He takes an extra long look at himself in the
mirror.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- LATER

Andrew, dressed in his suit, holding his suitcase, crosses
through the parking garage. He seems nervous, breathing hard.

INT. ELEVATOR --

LONG TAKE -- He gets into the elevator, rides it up, gets off,
and walks through the entire office. He passes Levi's office,
empty, passes Travis' office, empty, Billy's office, empty. He
heads over to the conference room and opens the door...

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM --

Levi, Billy, and Travis sit around the conference table with
serious expressions. They turn and stare at Andrew.

ANDREW
We having a meeting?
Levi nods.
Andrew senses some tension in the air.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
What's wrong?

TRAVIS
(calmly)
Can you close the door?

Andrew closes the door.

As he does, Levi stands up and smoothly takes out a gun and points
it right at Andrew's back. He turns around to see the gun and
freezes.

ANDREW
What the fuck?

LEVI
Sit down.

Andrew puts his hands up and wanders over to a chair.

He sits down and Travis immediately whips out some duct tape,
rips off a large piece and slaps it across Andrew's mouth. He
jerks up but Billy grabs his arms and holds them behind the
chair. Travis takes the rest of the duct tape and starts
wrapping it around his body and the chair.

Levi leans in...

LEVI (CONT'D)
Andrew, Andrew, Andrew. We have a
problem.

Andrew fights for a moment...

LEVI (CONT'D)
Do you know why we're doing this?

He obviously can't respond...

LEVI (CONT'D)
I thought we were brothers. I thought
we were family. We had a circle of
trust here, Andrew. But you know what
you did? You broke that bond. You
broke the motherfuckin' trust
circle, Andrew.

Andrew's eyes look confused.

LEVI (CONT'D)
You were gonna sell us out. You were
gonna tell the F.B.I. and fuck us!

He shakes his head furiously.

LEVI (CONT'D)
You can't deny that!
I...hear...everything. I have tiny
little eyeballs everywhere. This
isn't easy for us, Andrew. This is
hard....very, very hard. We don't
wanna have to kill you...but...I
think we have to. I think we have to
kill your girl too.

Andrew is breathing heavily, and in one big burst of strength
tries to rip out of the duct tape. He kind of breaks some of
it, and Travis and Billy hold him back down.

BILLY
Shit.

LEVI
Use more duct tape, shit.

Billy holds him down as Travis applies more tape.

LEVI (CONT'D)
Maybe I'm wrong here. Maybe I
shouldn't kill you. Do you have a
better idea? A better option? Cuz
we don't. We're not going to jail,
Andrew. We're not gonna let you sell
us out.

Andrew is trying to say something, we hear it muffled by the
tape.

BILLY
Maybe we should let him say
something.

Levi thinks about it...finally...rips the duct tape off of his
mouth.
Andrew yells out in pain.

LEVI
Talk, talk, talk.

ANDREW
(through breaths)
I don't...know...what the hell
you're talking about.

LEVI
Andrew...I miked your house.

ANDREW
Huh?

LEVI
I...miked...your...house. You were
going to rat us out.

ANDREW
What? No! No, I wasn't!

LEVI
We fucking heard you.

ANDREW
I wasn't serious! I would never
do that!

He motions to Travis to cover his mouth up again. Travis quickly
does...

LEVI
No denying it now, sir. I'm sorry.

Levi wanders over to the window.
LEVI (CONT'D)
You've put us in a very difficult
position.
He clutches his gun in his hands, calmly walks over to Andrew,
and WHACK! He hits him in the face with the back of his gun
and knocks him out.

FADE TO BLACK:

WE HEAR A RUSTLING AROUND, BREATHING, FINALLY, BRIGHTNESS...
EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- DAY

Andrew was in the back of a trunk, his face bruised and cut.
His hands are tied behind his back and he still has duct tape
over his mouth. Billy has just popped the trunk.

They're on top of a parking garage, no other cars around.
Billy is leaning up against the car.
He takes out a cigarette and lights it.

Andrew squirms for a moment and then realizes he can't free
himself.

BILLY
I don't know how we got here, man.
I feel like I'm in a fucking
nightmare...and I'm just waiting to
wake up from this shit.

(a beat)
They're looking for Heather right
now, Andrew. And me? I'm supposed
to get rid of you. I'm supposed to
kill you. I'm supposed to kill one
of my best friends!

Billy rubs his head.
Andrew fights harder to untie himself but it's useless.

BILLY (CONT'D)
The first outlaws of the 21st
century, huh? It sounds
romantic...but...all this shit...
everything we've been doing for the
last two years...it's all fucked up.
We're all insane, you know that? To
do what we've been doing? You have
to be wired a little
differently up here to go through
with any of this stuff. You know...my
goal...was always just about making
money...make as
much money as you can...make all the
money in the world...prove to people
and myself that I could do it. Why?
Probably cuz it was important to my
parents, I guess. But, one day I
finally realized
that isn't what makes me happy. I
still don't know what does
though...I'm still trying to figure
that out.

(a beat)
You're one of my best friends,
Andrew. I could never kill you...I
could never kill anyone. Levi?
Travis? They could kill.
They might have already killed her.
I don't know. But...that's for you
to figure out I guess.

He tosses his cigarette away, reaches over and helps Andrew out
of the trunk. Andrew's feet and hands are tied and he collapses
onto the ground.

Billy stands over him...

BILLY (CONT'D)
I'm leaving, Andrew. Billy the Kid
isn't gonna die young. Billy the Kid
is running off into the sunset. You
guys? I don't know what's going to
happen. I don't wanna know. I don't
wanna be here anymore. I wanna
change, I wanna be somebody else,
have a different
life.

He takes out a small knife and unties his feet and hands.

BILLY (CONT'D)
Wyatt Earp, huh? Good luck, man.
Take care of yourself.

He tosses Andrew's cellphone into his lap, rushes over to the
driver's seat and gets in. Andrew jumps up and rips the duct
tape off his mouth...

ANDREW
Billy! Wait! Where are they?! Where
are they?!

He jogs after the car but Billy quickly peels away and is gone.

He stops and looks down at his cellphone.
CUT TO:
INT. PARKING GARAGE -- LATER
Andrew dials Heather's number, and rushes down the stairs.
He listens for a moment, but the answering clicks on...

ANDREW
Fuck!

He continues down the stairs. Dials again...answering machine.

He reaches the bottom of the stairs and takes off into a full
speed sprint.

Mid-stride, he dials again...
No answer.

CUT TO:
EXT. CITY STREETS -- LATER

Andrew runs along the city street, breathing hard, sweating,
scanning the area for a taxi.

He sees one and darts into the street to flag it down. He waves
his arms wildly into the air. The taxi slams on its brakes.

cut TO:
EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE -- LATER

Levi and Travis are parked across the street waiting in their
car.

Travis lights a cigarette.

They wait, not talking to each other, Levi's eyes fixed on the
front door.

cut TO:
INT. TAXI -- EVENING

Andrew is breathing hard, continues to dial her number and still
no answer.
He reaches into his pocket, grabs his wallet and opens it. He
takes out Mike's business card and looks at it.

Finally, he dials the number.
ANDREW
Hello? Mike Northcut? (pause) Yes,
this is Andrew Thomas with the

Phoenix Group. (pause) I have
something to talk to you about.

EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE -- EVENING

The taxi pulls up to his house and Andrew jumps out. He doesn't
pay the driver and just runs toward the house.

DRIVER
Hey! You owe me...

He trails off as Andrew reaches the front door. He opens it...it
was unlocked.

ANDREW
Heather?!

He jogs into the kitchen, no one. He jogs into the living room...
INT. LIVING ROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE --

Levi and Travis are standing there, Levi holding a gun...
Andrew sees them and freezes...

LEVI
What the...

TRAVIS
Shit! I told you I should do it!

Levi doesn't respond to him.

ANDREW
Where's my wife?

LEVI
You tell me. We've been waiting for
her.

TRAVIS

Where's Billy?
ANDREW
He left.

LEVI
What'd you mean "he left?"

ANDREW
He's gone! He bailed! He doesn't
wanna be a part of this anymore...
just like me.

Levi raises his gun to Andrew...

LEVI
Too bad.

Andrew puts his hands up...

Levi kind

ANDREW
You think me and Billy are the only
ones who wanted out? Travis was gonna
do the same thing I was!

TRAVIS
Shut the fuck up.

ANDREW
I'm serious, Levi! He said you were
getting out of control.

of looks over at Travis...

TRAVIS
Shoot him, please.

ANDREW
He told Billy too! He always hated
that you were the leader! Remember?!

TRAVIS
Gimme the gun, please, I'll shoot
him.

LEVI
What's he talking about?

TRAVIS
He's trying to save his ass, what'd
you think?! Fucking kill him, man,
and lets get outta here!
ANDREW
It's the truth, Levi! Ask Billy!
It's true! He always hated how you
were Jesse James and shit, the
leader...isn't that right Travis?

TRAVIS
Shut your fucking mouth, Andrew.
Levi! Gimme the gun!

He lunges for it, but Levi steps back and points it at him.
They freeze there for a moment.

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
What're you doing?

LEVI
Maybe I should just kill both of you?

TRAVIS
Yeah, fuckin' maybe.

(a beat)
You really gonna let him manipulate
you like this? Are you that weak?

LEVI
I forgot...do I trust you?

TRAVIS
You're so fucking paranoid, man.

Travis takes out a cigarette and lights it.

TRAVIS (CONT'D)
You need to figure some shit out for
yourself, because if you can't trust
me, you can't trust anyone.

LEVI
Yeah, maybe I can't trust anyone.

TRAVIS
You know...I always thought I had
some problems...but...compared to
you...

EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE -- SAME TIME

A car pulls up to the side garage...and out steps Heather.
INT. LIVING ROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE --
TRAVIS
Is this what you wanted, Andrew?
You wanted this thing to
self-destruct? We were on top of the
world, you realize that?

LEVI
We still are...

Suddenly, Heather crosses into the living room, sees them
standing there, and SCREAMS!

Her high-pitched scream startles Levi and he SHOOTS TRAVIS!
BANG!

The bullet slices through Travis' chest, his cigarette drops
from his mouth.

In this instance, Andrew spins around, and grabs Heather...

ANDREW
RUN!

Levi looks over at them but rushes over to Travis...

LEVI
Shit! Shit!

Travis is coughing up blood, as Levi leans down next to him.

LEVI (CONT'D)
I didn't...mean...

TRAVIS
(coughing)
This feels...pretty real.
EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE --

Andrew and Heather run out to her car...

ANDREW
Gimme the keys!

She tosses the keys to him, and they pile in.

He fires up the car and they peel out.
INT. LIVING ROOM, ANDREW'S HOUSE --
Levi gets up and runs out of the house.
EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE --

Levi makes it outside in time to see Andrew and Heather drive
down the street.

INT. CAR -- LATER
Andrew and Heather drive down the street, Andrew pulls the car
over on the side of the road. He unbuckles his seat belt, reaches

over and they hug...

ANDREW
Baby, I love you.

HEATHER
I'm scared...what's going on...

ANDREW
It's okay...everything is taken care
of now...we're gonna be alright...
FADE TO BLACK:
CUT TO:
EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON A FEW BULLETS BEING LOADED INTO A CHAMBER.
INT. OFFICE -- NIGHT

(SCENE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE)

WE ARE WIDE on this darkly lit office. A giant glass wall
overlooks the bright, city lights of Phoenix, Arizona.

Standing in the middle of the room is a MAN, that we now identify
as Levi.

He is holding a gun in his hands...clutching it tightly.
INT. WHITE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

WE ARE CENTERED ON A WHITE HALLWAY -- THREE MEN, F.B.I.
OFFICIALS, suddenly rush around the corner.

We now identify one of the men as Mike Northcut.
They're holding a few folders, walking briskly...

OFFICIAL #1
He's ready-

MIKE
-Full confession?

OFFICIAL #1
Full confession.

OFFICIAL #3
He wants total immunity.

They turn the corner and enter a small dark room, where a single
light shines over a MAN at a table, that we now identify as
Andrew.

The three men pull up chairs across from him.

One of them pulls out a small recording device, sets it up in
front of Andrew, and hits record.

MIKE
Someone went to work on that eye.

He doesn't respond.
MIKE (CONT'D)
I’ve been chasing you guys for awhile
now, huh?
Still no response...
MIKE (CONT'D)
But I always knew..I always knew.
He reaches over and hits record on the recording device.

MIKE (CONT'D)
Okay...tell us what happened...

INT. OFFICE -- NIGHT

Levi continues to clutch the gun, staring out at the city.
Finally, in one swift movement, he raises it to his head and
fires.

CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM --
Andrew leans into the light...
ANDREW
Well, first, I wanna know I have
immunity.
Mike looks around.
MIKE

Sir, we actually can't promise that
at this time, but I assure you, that
your cooperation will favor you in
court sentencing-

ANDREW
-What if I told you that I could help
bring in another person
too...someone you might be very
interested in bringing in. Would
that give me immunity?

MIKE
Who?

EXT. DESERT -- DAY

There are two SUV's parked in the middle of the desert. After
a moment, we see Andrew get out of one of the cars.

He walks out into the middle of the two cars and waits for a
moment, until the doors of the other car open and out steps
Tan'el and his assistant.

Andrew flashes a huge fake smile.

TAN'EL
My favorite broker!

Andrew tosses them a duffle bag...

ANDREW
Ten million. Back like we told you.
TAN'EL
My man! And don't think I won't want
to invest with you guys again.

ANDREW
I don't think that's gonna happen.

TAN'EL
Why not?

ANDREW
I'm quitting the business. Moving
away for awhile.

TAN'EL
Too bad. Well, I hope you live a good
life my friend.

ANDREW
You as well.

They shake and Andrew turns and heads back to his car.

He gets in as Tan'el wanders back to his car.

Andrew peels out and dust flies up. Before Tan'el is even in
the car, Andrew is already booking out of there. Finally, after
Andrew's car is about fifty yards away, WE SEE FOUR BLACK SUV'S
APPEAR FROM EACH ANGLE HEADING RIGHT TOWARD TAN'EL'S VEHICLE.
Tan'el looks around, scared, not knowing what's going on.

INT. F.B.I SUV --

Mike is in shotgun of one of the cars, staring straight ahead,
clenching his jaw.

CUT TO:
EXT. BACKYARD, ANDREW'S HOME -- SAME TIME
We slowly move in on a hill of dirt...and see that next to it
is a big hole...where Heather and Andrew buried the one million
dollars in cash...it's gone now.

cut TO:

INT. ANDREW'S CAR --
Andrew lets out a scream of excitement. Heather appears from
the backseat, she was ducking down.

ANDREW
We did it baby!

HEATHER
Home free, huh?

ANDREW
Yeah, we just gotta find where that
home is now.

He smiles.

HEATHER
Well, what are you thinking...Vegas?

ANDREW
Can we afford Vegas?

Heather reveals the duffle bag with the one million dollars in
cash...

HEATHER
We got about one million, so how long
can that last in Vegas?

ANDREW
I guess we'll find out.

They both laugh.
EXT. DESERT --

THEY FLY THROUGH THE DESERT AND FINALLY REACH A PAVED ROAD. WE
WATCH THEM DISAPPEAR INTO THE DISTANCE.

We hear a voice over from an earlier scene as they drive away
and we see the desert, old west landscape...

LEVI (V.0.)
Welcome to the twenty-first century,
gentlemen.

ANDREW (V.O.)
Feels good.

LEVI (V.0.)
This is our time. This is our time
to define what the twenty-first
century is going to represent. Wecan
shape it.

BILLY (V.O.)
The first outlaws of the new
millenium.

FADE OUT:

THE END.
