       EXT. REDDINGTON ROAD, HAMPSTEAD. LONDON. LATE AFTERNOON.
 

        
		FADE IN... THE PURR OF A CAR ENGINE, idling. WINTER TWILIGHT.    
		       HEAVY RAIN... A leafy avenue  
		bordered with somber mansions...  
		      
		       A HAND FLICKS a cigarette out the carís window...  
		It flies through   
		       the rain...  
		       HITS THE WET TARMAC WITH A SPRAY  
		OF SPARKS.  
		       IN AND HOLD ON XAVIER LOMBARD, at the wheel of a TRIUMPH 2000.    
		        
		Late 30s, dark, short hair, stony-faced, in a conservative dark   
		       suit and white shirt - collar  
		button undone... Through the open   
		       window his eyes survey...  
		        
		BEYOND OPEN GATES FLANKED WITH A SECURITY CAMERA: the lit- up   
		       facade of a white mansion fronted  
		by a gravel drive; parked there:   
		       A BLUE ASTON MARTIN, TWO FERRARIS AND A DAIMLER...
 

        
		INT. TRIUMPH. LATE AFTERNOON.
 
       IN ON Lombard as he glances at... The passenger seat: A SCRIBBLED  
		       NOTE beside an OPEN PACK OF PLAIN GITANES and A SPORTS BAG:   
		        
		ďSpitz, 46 Reddington Road, NW6... 5pm...Ē  
		       HIS WATCH (leather strap, flat with hands): 17:07...   
		       Lombard swallows without parting his lips...  
		       QUICK SEQUENCE...  
		His left foot (FINE BLACK LEATHER SHOE) pushing   
		       the clutch pedal; His left hand (GOLD WEDDING  
		BAND) shifting the   
		       car into gear; His right hand spinning the wheel (SILVER   
		        
		CUFFLINKS); His right foot pushing the rev pedal...
 

       EXT. DE MORAES DRIVEWAY. LATE AFTERNOON. 
 
       The Triumph wheel crunches to a stop on the gravel next to the   
		        
		Aston Martinís polished spoked wheel...
 

       INT. TRIUMPH. LATE AFTERNOON.
 
        
		Eyeing up the Aston Martin, Lombard turns his engine off, starts   
		       winding up his window and catches  
		sight of...   
		       A UNIFORMED BUTLER under a huge umbrella heading his way...  
 

        
		EXT. DE MORAESí DRIVEWAY. LATE AFTERNOON.
 
       The butler - stiff, sour, middle-aged - opens  
		the Triumph door.  
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                 Mister Xavier Lombard?
 
        
		Lombard eyes him coldly, then, unfastening his seatbelt:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thatís right.
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                 Will you please come with me?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 That might depend on where  
		youíre going.
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                 I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and  
		Mrs De Moraesí   
		                 majordomo. They are  
		expecting you.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat; he looks  
		him up and down)  
		                 De Moraes? I was  
		asked here by a Mrs   
		                 Spitz.
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                 That would be Mrs De Moraes  
		mother, Sir.   
		                 Mr and Mrs Spitz are  
		here with their   
		                 daughter.
 
        
		Lombard eyes him a while longer, pockets his Gitanes and steps out   
		       the car under the butlerís  
		umbrella... The butler shuts the door.
 

       INT. DE MORAESí MANSION, HALLWAY. LATE AFTERNOON.
 
        
		Footsteps echoing... Grand white marble floor, broad staircase,   
		       modern art...  Lombard peers  
		around, following close behind the   
		       butler who heads for...  
		        
		Huge double doors; The butler opens them, stands aside, announces:
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                 Mister Lombard.
 

        
		INT. DE MORAESí DRAWING ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON.
 
       Lombard steps in past the butler - who backs  
		out, closing the   
		       doors - and stops... taking in...  
		       A BLACK  
		AND WHITE NIGHTMARE of modern Italian interior decorating:   
		       lots of marble, chrome, glass, steel  
		and leather; more modern art.    
		       WE FIND...  
		       An old couple,  
		THE SPITZES, sit side by side at a glass table,   
		       strangely upright, she dark, intense, her hands  
		on a large   
		       envelope, he morose and bespectacled, with a coffee mug and half-  
		        
		eaten DOUGHNUT...  DEBORAH (stunning, in a crimson tweed suit, its   
		       jacket low cut, baring  
		her cleavage and pearl necklace) stands   
		       behind them, arms crossed, a cigarette between her fingers...  
		And,   
		       deep in the room by a blazing fire, CARLOS (dark, handsome, Latin   
		        
		manhood in all its carnal glory) and MR BANI (50s, very Italian)   
		       sit in armchairs studying huge  
		technical diagrams and EYEING   
		       LOMBARD ABSENT-MINDEDLY. Mrs Spitz motions to the chair of twisted  
		       metal opposite her, saying, in a strong, rasping GERMAN ACCENT:
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 You are late, Mr Lombard.  
		I very much hope   
		                 you are better at  
		your job than at keeping   
		                 time. Anyway,  
		come and sit down.
 
       Lombard peers at her; a flicker of irritation behind his eyes...   
		        
		Then, wilfully:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Good afternoon, Mrs...?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  
		                    
		(perfunctorily introducing the others)  
		                  
		My husband...  
		                   (Mr Spitz  
		nods at Lombard)  
		                 My daughter, Deborah,  
		whose house this is.  
		                   (Deborah  
		just looks back at him)  
		                 My son-in-law,  
		Carlos...    
		                   (he shows  
		a few white teeth)  
		                 The gentleman is  
		a business partner of   
		                 his.  
		                    
		(Mr Bani looks blankly at Lombard)
 
       Now are you going to sit down or is it your intention  
		to remain   
		       standing, Mr Lombard?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Come, come, give the man time  
		to probe,   
		                 Mummy. Donít you know private  
		detectives   
		                 like to appraise people?  
		                   (looking Lombard up and  
		down)  
		                 Arenít I right, Mr Lombard?
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; a frown... He APPRAISES Deborah... rests his gaze   
		       on her cleavage... SMILES...  
		glances towards... Carlos and Mr Bani   
		       have begun to whisper IN ITALIAN over their diagrams (THEIR  
		KEEN   
		       WHISPERED CHAT WILL GO ON THROUGHOUT THE SCENE)... turns back to   
		        
		Deborah, sends her a charming smile and starts for the table...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The pleasure is mine, Mrs  
		De Moraes.
 
       Deborah purses her lips, takes a drag of her cigarette and sneers   
		        
		as...  Lombard sits, grimaces, twists to inspect his chairís   
		       tortuous back, turns back to  
		the Spitzes and, now appreciating why   
		       they sit so stiffly, grins, pushes his chair back, settles  
		on its   
		       edge and reaches for his Gitanes...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 May I...(smoke)?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                   (she waves a  
		hand: ĎIf you mustí)  
		                 May I ask if  
		you are Jewish, Mr Lombard? 
 
       IN ON Lombard; a fed-up frown as he lights his cigarette...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Lombard, this is not a Jewish  
		name, is it?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (pocketing his  
		Gitanes, with a SMILE)  
		                 I hope itís  
		not too significant.
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 What if it is?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Well, I would have to point  
		out that we   
		                 could have dealt with  
		that question when   
		                 you called this  
		morning, Mrs Spitz. I   
		                 wouldnít like  
		to think Iíd kept you   
		                 waiting for  
		nothing.
 
       IN ON Mrs Spitz... Displeasure darkens her eyes... She appraises   
		        
		him...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Whatever, you come recommended.  
		We...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Recommended?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Must I speak to you in French?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Didnít you say I came recommended?  
		                    
		(off her look: ĎYesí)  
		                 Thatís what  
		I thought. May I know by whom?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 You may not. And besides,  
		it is   
		                 irrelevant.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (after a beat,  
		deciding to yield)  
		                 Okay. Recommended...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Good. Now, as I trust you  
		may have   
		                 guessed, we are looking  
		for someone to   
		                 work for us. Someone  
		whose discretion can   
		                 be relied upon.  
		Someone who while in our   
		                 employ would  
		give us full commitment. Do   
		                 you think  
		you could be that person, Mr   
		                 Lombard?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he peers at her,  
		then at his   
		                    cigarette)  
		                  
		Look Mrs Spitz... I donít know to whom Iím   
		                  
		indebted for the recommendation but... Iím   
		                  
		not in the business of making oaths of   
		                  
		allegiance or giving myself character   
		                  
		references. What I do is listen to what   
		                  
		the people who care to call me have to say   
		                  
		and judge whether or not I can be of help.   
		                  
		I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.  
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 What I can appreciate is  
		insolence, Mr   
		                 Lombard!
 
        
		Lombard scowls, turns to... Mr Spitz, eyes fixed on his cup, says   
		       a few words in YIDDISH... his  
		hand squeezing his wifeís arm, a   
		       gesture firm but appeasing.  
 
                                
		DEBORAH (OS)  
		                 Would you like a doughnut,  
		Mr Lombard?
 
       Lombard looks up... IN ON Deborah; a provocative smile, gleeful   
		        
		contempt...  
		       Lombard stands, leans across the table, stamps out his cigarette   
		        
		in her ashtray.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Donít disturb the butler.  
		I remember the   
		                 way out.
 
                                
		MISTER SPITZ  
		                   (softly;  
		MILD GERMAN ACCENT)  
		                 Sit down, please,  
		Mr Lombard. Sit down...
 
       Lombard turns to Mr Spitz... uneasy eyes in a patchwork of deep  
		       wrinkles...
 
                                
		MISTER SPITZ  
		                 Please, forgive us. We  
		did not mean to   
		                 offend you. Itís  
		just that...
 
                                 
		 DEBORAH  
		                 Let him go, Daddy. This  
		is pointless   
		                 anyway. Wonder boyís  
		soon enough going to   
		                 run out of cash  
		and stagger back to the   
		                 nest.
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Shut up, Deborah!
 
        
		UNEASY SILENCE.  Deborah sighs, sneers, stamps out her cigarette.
 
                                
		MISTER SPITZ  
		                 We were hoping to ask  
		you to look for our   
		                 son, Mr Lombard.  
		He...  
		                   (off Lombardís look)  
		                  
		He has been missing for three weeks now.   
		                  
		We are worried he might be in trouble...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Oh, come on! If you must go  
		ahead with   
		                 this you might as well  
		get to the point.  
		                   (to  
		Lombard)  
		                 As for you, if youíre determined  
		to stay   
		                 and hear about my dear brotherís  
		riveting   
		                 personality, you might as  
		well sit down   
		                 again. Boredom is easier  
		handled that way.   
		                 And by the way,  
		before you ask, the boy   
		                 Leon is 31  
		years old.
 
       SILENCE AGAIN.  Mrs Spitz glares at Deborah, who lights a new   
		        
		cigarette...  Mr Spitz fixes his pained eyes on his clasped   
		       hands...    
		        
		Lombard decides to sit down, saying helpfully to the Spitzes:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I take it your son is called  
		Leon?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Leonard. What my daughter  
		is on about, Mr   
		                 Lombard, is that  
		Leonard is somewhat of a   
		                 Bohemian.  
		You might as well know that...  
		                  
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 For Bohemian read ex-university  
		drop-out   
		                 and ex-failed rock star  
		recently turned   
		                 Artist Photographer.  
		Oh yes, and a most   
		                 likely relapsing  
		ex-heroin addict.
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 We do not know that for  
		certain, Deborah!  
		                   
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I said Ďlikelyí, Mummy.
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                   (to Lombard,  
		irritated)  
		                 Leonard is a good boy,  
		but sadly he likes   
		                 bad company and  
		is susceptible... Two   
		                 years ago we  
		sent him to a... a   
		                 detoxification  
		clinic. It has had the   
		                 desired effect.  
		He has since been very   
		                 content living  
		in the apartment I bought   
		                 him here  
		in London and, until three weeks   
		                  
		ago, he called every fortnight to our home   
		                  
		in Scotland.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Money doesnít grow on trees...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                   (to Lombard,  
		with irate defensiveness)  
		                 Leonard  
		is now devoting his time to   
		                 photography.  
		It is good for him. My   
		                 husband and  
		I have chosen to support him   
		                 in this.  
		He also works, though. In a   
		                 restaurant...  
		                    
		(quickly, preempting Deborah)  
		                 He washes  
		the dishes. Three evenings a   
		                 week  
		he washes the dishes.
 
       TENSE SILENCE; Lombard surveys the opulent room, comes across...  
		        
		A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH: Carlos, triumphant in racing driverís   
		       overalls, on a podium - Magnum of  
		Champagne in one hand, garland   
		       around his neck...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What do you think has happened  
		to your   
		                 son, Mrs Spitz?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 You wouldnít be here if  
		I knew, Mr   
		                 Lombard. What I do know  
		is that he has not   
		                 been at work for  
		three weeks. That   
		                 enquiries to the  
		police and London   
		                 hospitals have  
		borne no results. And that   
		                 a check  
		with his bank revealed he has not   
		                  
		used his account for four weeks now.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Do what, Mr Lombard?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Check with your sonís bank.  
		Banks donít   
		                 usually give out information  
		about their   
		                 customers. 
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 I said earlier that my husband  
		and I are   
		                 supporting Leonard in his  
		photography, Mr   
		                 Lombard. By this  
		I mean that since his   
		                 return from  
		America I have been depositing   
		                 for  
		him a monthly allowance in an account   
		                  
		we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not   
		                  
		have to break the law to find out if he   
		                  
		used the account.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I didnít mean to imply you  
		did, Mrs Spitz. 
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Then you should not have  
		sought an   
		                 explanation.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (after a beat,  
		grinning)  
		                 I presume you checked your  
		sonís   
		                 apartment...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Yesterday. It all looked  
		normal.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Did you look for his passport,  
		driving   
		                 licence?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Leonard does not hold a  
		driving licence.   
		                 As for his passport,  
		I do not know where   
		                 he keeps it.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 So he could have decided to  
		go on a   
		                 trip...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 He could indeed, Mr Lombard.  
		But had he   
		                 done so I think he would  
		have let us know   
		                 about it.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Then why arenít you asking  
		the police to   
		                 look for your son,  
		Mrs Spitz?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 At last! A pertinent question.  
		Come on,   
		                 Mummy: answer the detective.
 
                                
		MISTER SPITZ  
		                   (looking  
		up sadly into Lombardís eyes)  
		                 Leonard  
		used to disappear like this before   
		                  
		his treatment, Mr Lombard. Whether he has   
		                  
		reverted to his former habit is something   
		                  
		we would rather not find out through the   
		                  
		police. Iím sure you can understand...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                   (with a scolding  
		glance at her   
		                    husband)  
		)  
		                 I am categorical Leonard has had  
		no   
		                 interest in drugs since he came  
		back from   
		                 America.
 
        
		The Spitzes eye each other somberly... 
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Now you know why youíre here,  
		Mr Lombard.   
		                   (enjoying  
		herself now)  
		                 It might be difficult  
		for someone like you   
		                 to discern,  
		but we are people of a certain   
		                 standing.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Appearances can be deceptive,  
		Mrs De   
		                 Moraes.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 That depends what youíre looking  
		at.
 
       IN ON Deborah; cold defiance in her eyes... IN ON Lombard; a cruel   
		        
		flicker in his... He softens, smiles, asks, only slowly moving his   
		       eyes away from hers...  
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I take it your son is not  
		married, Mrs   
		                 Spitz?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 No. And before you ask,  
		no, heís not gay!   
		                 He has had girlfriends,  
		but nothing   
		                 serious...  
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Any friends?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 The proprietor of his workplace  
		is the   
		                 only friend of his we know  
		about.   
		                   (she slaps the  
		envelope on the table)  
		                 His address  
		is in this envelope with   
		                 Leonardís  
		address, keys and other things   
		                 you  
		might need.  
		                   (she glances  
		impatiently at her watch)
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím sure... As far as you  
		know, when and   
		                 where was your son  
		last seen?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 When... Iím told he came  
		here...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Three weeks ago. To borrow  
		money. I wasnít   
		                 here but he got to  
		my husband, sold him   
		                 some fancy story  
		about an exhibition of   
		                 his work and  
		needing money to get new   
		                 prints made.  
		Carlos handed over £1,000 to   
		                 get  
		rid of him.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 And that is the last time  
		any...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Well, Leon does not need money  
		for prints,   
		                 Mr Lombard. Does his  
		own printing.   
		                 Wouldnít want anyone  
		to interfere with his   
		                 ĎArtí!  
		                    
		(after a beat, perversely)  
		                 Which,  
		as he subsequently vanished, raises   
		                  
		the question: what was the money for?   
		                  
		Perish the thought.
 
       IN ON Mrs Spitz - this has hit home; she scowls at the envelope   
		        
		under her fingers... slides it across the table towards Lombard...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 The £1,000 is on account.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he peers at the  
		envelope, then off   
		                     
		her look)  
		                 My rates...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 We are aware of your rates,  
		Mr Lombard. We   
		                 will pay you double  
		your rates plus   
		                 expenses. In return,  
		need I say it again,   
		                 we expect discretion  
		and undivided   
		                 attention.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a long beat;  
		then, grinning)  
		                 Why do you think your  
		son chose not to   
		                 come to you for  
		funds for his photography,   
		                 Mrs Spitz?
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His  
		monthly   
		                 allowance is all he is to  
		expect from us.   
		                 He knows it and we  
		feel the amount is more   
		                 than adequate.
 
        
		Lombard nods... thinks... reaches for the envelope and stands...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 My husband and I will be  
		leaving tomorrow   
		                 for a short stay  
		in Israel. Deborah will   
		                 be here if  
		you need anything before our   
		                 return.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Fine. One more thing, Mrs  
		and Mr Spitz;   
		                 may I ask what is or  
		was your occupation?
 
                                
		MISTER SPITZ  
		                 We make and sell shoes  
		and leather   
		                 garments.
 
        
		Lombard peers briefly at him, nods, then turns to Deborah:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (taken aback,  
		after a beat...)  
		                 I have too much money  
		to work, Mr Lombard.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Is that why your brother braved  
		coming   
		                 here to ask you for a loan?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (she eyeballs  
		him, then, calmly:)  
		                 Perhaps it wasnít  
		so brave of him. Had I   
		                 been here  
		I just might have given him his   
		                 money,  
		Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards   
		                  
		from the strangest of conduct, as someone   
		                  
		in your line of work ought to know.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he grins, nods,  
		turns to Carlos,   
		                     
		calls:)  
		                 Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  
		                    
		(Carlos looks back, baffled)  
		                 The £1,000.  
		You gave it to him in cash?
 
                                   
		CARLOS  
		                   (SUAVE BRAZILIAN  
		ACCENT)  
		                 Oh. Leon. Yes. Weíve always  
		got cash in...   
		                 We always keep money  
		in the house.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 De Moraes. Thatís a Brazilian  
		name, no?
 
                                   
		CARLOS  
		                   (flashing white  
		teeth)  
		                 Thatís right. Do you know Brazil?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No. Do you work, Mr De Moraes?
 
                                   
		CARLOS  
		                 Work? Oh yes. I race motorcars,  
		you   
		                 know...  
		                    
		(waving towards the diagrams)  
		                 That  
		is what this is all about, ha ha...
 
       IN ON Lombard...  A polite smile.
 

        
		EXT. FOOTBALL PITCH, MARKET ROAD. EARLY EVENING.
 
       POURING RAIN on a floodlit pitch.   
		A match is in progress, a LOCAL-   
		       SHOPKEEPERS-KEEP-FIT kind of affair; men of all shapes, ages  
		and   
		       races run, puff and yell in disparate shirts divided into YELLOWS   
		        
		and REDS.  
		       The ball is kicked into the air... drops to... Lombard (LIVERPOOL   
		        
		SHIRT) kills its fall on his chest, proceeds upfield...  past one   
		       YELLOW PLAYER... another...  
		goes for a third, slips and falls...   
		       ďFOUL!Ē screams someone...  Lombard picks himself up,  
		grins at...   
		       A player with a crew cut: MARK OAK.
 

       EXT.  
		UPPER STREET, NORTH LONDON. EARLY EVENING.
 
       MORE RAIN. CARS CRAWL in the halos of their headlights,  
		crowds   
		       scurry along the pavements, between the cars...   
		       IN  
		ON A GOOD-LOOKING BRUNETTE, a striking figure, umbrella held   
		       high; she saunters around the front  
		of...  
		       LOMBARDíS TRIUMPH, at the kerb, engine idling... Through swishing   
		        
		wipers, Lombard, in tracksuit top, watches her impassively, a   
		       cigarette between his lips... His  
		passenger door is open, a man,   
		       Mark Oak, in a raincoat, is leaning into the car, eyes greedily  
		       following the brunette as he talks (HIS DIALOGUE COVERING ALL THE   
		        
		ABOVE):
 
                           
		MARK OAK (ON/OFF SCREEN)  
		                 ĎSo whatís  
		your problem?í I says; ĎI mean,   
		                 if  
		sheís beautiful and great in bed,   
		                  
		huh?!í  ĎWell, sheís kind of psychic,í he   
		                  
		says; ĎYou know - precognitive.í  ĎWell,   
		                  
		if sheís a good fuck,í I says, Ďwho cares,   
		                  
		huh?í ĎThatís just it,í he says; ĎWhenever   
		                  
		weíre at it, she keeps yelling ďAnthony!   
		                  
		Anthony!Ēí The guyís called Steve, right?   
		                  
		ĎSorry?í I says. And you know what the   
		                  
		poor bloke says?  He says: ĎShe says she   
		                  
		canít help it. Sheís got to yell the name   
		                  
		of the next bloke sheís gonna lay.í    
		                  
		Honest to God, ha-ha...
 

       INT. TRIUMPH. EARLY EVENING.
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; a polite smile... then a frown as he sees...    
		       Arriving beside Mark Oak: JANE  
		(young, bubbly, shamelessly   
		       flirtatious, in a puffa jacket) panting but beaming through her   
		        
		drooping wet blond hair...
 
                                  
		MARK OAK  
		                 Oh Dear! Hereís my other  
		tenant...
 
                                   
		 JANE  
		                   (keeping her  
		eyes on Lombard)  
		                 Hello, Mr Oak. Hi,  
		Savieer. Youíre going   
		                 home?
 
                                  
		MARK OAK  
		                   (before Lombard  
		can speak, gesturing   
		                     
		her in)  
		                 He is. If you would, mademoiselle.
 
        
		Jane sends Lombard a searching glance...  He nods...  She beams,   
		       gets in, noticing...  
		Lombardís eyes on her hands holding something   
		       under her jacket...
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Fish and chips. Keeping it warm.
 
                                  
		MARK OAK  
		                   (leaning in again,  
		winking at Lombard)  
		                 Better rush. Just  
		saw a brunette going my   
		                 way.  
		                    
		(sniffing the air above Jane)  
		                 Ah,  
		the smell of warm, moist fish... Too   
		                  
		bad...
 
       He grins at Jane and shuts the door.  Jane watches him walk away   
		        
		with a disgusted look on her face, then, as Lombard pulls away,   
		       says coyly:
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Hello again, neighbour. I didnít  
		intrude,   
		                 did I?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 How are you, Jane?
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Fine. How was the match? Did  
		you loose? 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No.
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Must be your lucky day then.  
		Iíve got your   
		                 accounts - you donít  
		owe much tax for last   
		                 year.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Good.
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Yes. But my boss reckons youíd  
		still be   
		                 better off as a limited  
		company. For   
		                 expenses and all that,  
		you know? Itíd cost   
		                 you about £100  
		but he said itíd be worth   
		                 it.  
		                    
		(off Lombardís silence)  
		                 Of course,  
		youíd need a partner to   
		                 register.  
		But thatís a formality. I mean,   
		                 I  
		could be your partner. I mean, just as a   
		                  
		name, right?
 
       Lombard grins; this is all too familiar... He pulls into quiet   
		        
		ESSEX ROAD, revs-up...  Jane gazes pensively at his hand on the   
		       gear stick, looks away...
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Have you heard of a French film  
		called ďLa   
		                 CollectionooseĒ?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 La what?
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 ďLa collectionooseĒ. Itís about  
		a young   
		                 girl in the south of France  
		who seduces a   
		                 different man every  
		night and then meets   
		                 one who resists  
		her. Itís on TV tonight   
		                 and as Iím  
		in I thought we could perhaps   
		                 look  
		at your accounts and... The review   
		                  
		says itís about the conflict between   
		                  
		intellect and instinct. And witty. The   
		                  
		directorís supposed to be famous. Rommel   
		                  
		or something. French. You must know him?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Should I?
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 I donít know. How many famous  
		French film   
		                 directors can there be?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 That are called Rommel or  
		something, I   
		                 guess not that many.  
		                    
		(he pulls up at the kerb)
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 So you havenít seen the film,  
		then?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Itís Friday night, Jane. What  
		happened to   
		                 your latest boyfriend?
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Oh... We split up.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (switching his  
		engine off)  
		                 Well, I hope youíre not  
		too heartbroken   
		                 and...
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Oh no. Iím all right. He was  
		a jerk,   
		                 really. Another boy, you  
		know? All I meet   
		                 is boys. When I  
		think of all the fuss   
		                 about older  
		men fancying young girls. I   
		                 mean,  
		is it true?
 
       Lombard shakes his head, picks up his sportsbag and gets out...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Your fish and chips must be  
		getting cold,   
		                 Jane.
 

        
		EXT. ESSEX ROAD. EVENING.
 
       Jane gets out INTO THE RAIN, asking across the Triumph roof: 
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 No. Seriously. I mean, what about  
		you,   
		                 Savieer? Do you think older  
		men like   
		                 younger girls?
 
        
		He peers at her... Mild despair... He flicks his Gitane away,   
		       locks his door...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What about Mr Oak, Jane?  
		                    
		(looking up, off her puzzled look:)  
		                  
		He might even give you a rent rebate.
 
       IN ON Jane; she understands... A stung young animal...  
		she glares   
		       and... storms off to a door beside the screened shop front of a   
		        
		building... IN ON Lombard; a touched smile as he watches her   
		       struggle angrily with her keys...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iíve got work tonight, Jane.
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                   (too hurt and angry  
		for cleverness)  
		                 Oh yeah! Better be  
		good and hurry away   
		                 then! Who knows?  
		We might be being   
		                 watched! Maybe  
		one of your stupid French   
		                 companies  
		has got a detective prying into   
		                 your  
		life - after all, thatís what they do   
		                  
		to their employees, isnít it? Huh! Hope   
		                  
		you enjoy ruining peopleís lives. Thanks   
		                  
		for the lift!
 
       She goes in, slams the door... Standing in the rain, Lombard peers   
		        
		coldly at the door then... makes for it, puts his key in the   
		       lock...  As he struggles with  
		the lock we see.. A sign above the   
		       shop: M. OAK &amp; SONS, FAMILY BUTCHER.
 

        
		INT. LOMBARDíS OFFICE, LOMBARDíS FLAT. EVENING.
 
       SILENCE BUT FOR SOME SOFT SHUFFLING MOVEMENTS...   
		The room is BARE   
		       - four chairs, a desk with computer, telephone and answering   
		        
		machine and TWO GOLDFISH in a large aquarium.
 
       IN ON the desk; on and around MRS SPITZíS  
		ENVELOPE: a wad of £50   
		       notes, a set of Yale keys, an A4 sheet with, in neat handwriting:   
		       Deborahís phone number... the Spitzes Scottish number... and:
 
        
		-ďLeonardís Address: 14b, Drake Avenue, NW2. (top floor)Ē  
		       -ďPhilip Smith (Leonardís Employer):  
		The Four Seasons, Holmes   
		       Road, NW5. Tel: 0171...Ē 
 

        
		INT. LOMBARDíS BEDROOM, LOMBARDíS FLAT. EVENING.
 
       DIFFUSED LIGHTING. In front of a mirror,  
		Lombard finishes dressing   
		       in a clean suit, fastening his cufflinks... WE MOVE ON TO...
 
        
		LOMBARDís football kit strewn on a chair... A TV set on a stool...   
		       An open wardrobe... A roughly  
		made bed with a dry-cleanerís   
		       wrapper and a dark suit jacket on it... A half-full ashtray and  
		       Gitanes pack on the bedside-table... 
 

       EXT. RESIDENTIAL  
		STREET, NORTH LONDON. EVENING. 
 
       RAIN. In a raincoat, smoking, Lombard leans against his  
		Triumph,   
		       eyeing...
 
       Across the street: A MODERN APARTMENT  
		COMPLEX... He flicks his   
		       cigarette away... 
 

       INT. LEON  
		SPITZí APARTMENT. EVENING.
 
       SILENCE.  Lombard stands in the doorway, against the lit  
		       corridor... IN ON his gold-banded hand feeling the wall, finding   
		        
		the lightswitch... LIGHT!  He is looking into a HALLWAY.  He goes   
		       in, shuts the door  
		and steps into...
 
       THE LIVING ROOM (spacious, all mod-cons, noticeably CLEAN AND   
		        
		TIDY).  Lombard surveys the room, eyes scanning the walls hung   
		       with...  
		        
		Large BLACK &amp; WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS: A naked girl in a coffin as if   
		       dead ;  A scantily  
		clad girl in contorted pose with blood and   
		       wounds (after-rape scene?) ; A girl pierced with arrows  
		(fallen   
		       angel?) ; A girl in nightgown impaled on railings (broken   
		        
		innocence?) ; A girl in a foggy landscape, dressed as death, with   
		       scythe and all, mouth wide  
		in a scream - an explanatory caption   
		       here: ďDOES DEATH FEAR DEATH?Ē.  
		        
		Lombard shakes his head, proceeds around the room, past...  
 
       Bookshelves... A few spines...

       Tape and CD collection - Bob Dylan, The Doors, Nirvana...  
		        
		Video shelf... old B&amp;W thrillers, Ďnoirí titles like ĎDOAí, ĎThe   
		       Big Heatí etc...   
		A Disney tape: ĎSleeping Beautyí... LOMBARD   
		       RAISES AN EYEBROW...
 
        
		Now he rifles through a pile of magazines... ĎTime Outí, ĎSight &amp;   
		       Soundí... a book of  
		photographs by Bill Brandt...  
		       He glances at the FLASHING LIGHT of an Answerphone and goes out  
		       to...
 
       THE KITCHEN (tidy, but for a dirty bowl and spoon  
		by the sink).    
		       He lifts the dustbin lid, looks inside...
 
        
		Empty cereal box, milk carton, Ravioli cans...
 
       THE BEDROOM (Spartan, a double bed, messed  
		up on one side only).   
		       Lombard scans the room from the doorway, moves to...
 
        
		The bedside table... A box of tissues, an open book, cover facing   
		       up: ďOCCULT BONDAGE AND DELIVERANCEĒ...
 
        
		Lombard opens the drawer... a COLOUR PHOTO in a perspex stand...    
		       He reaches for it... A  
		COUPLE arm in arm by a mountain stream -   
		       she, good- looking, blond, late 20s, jeans, country  
		type; he,   
		       early 30s, thin, with long black curly hair, roughly dressed.  
		                                        
		       He replaces the snapshot, moves to... A chest of drawers; he pulls   
		        
		open the top drawer, glances in...
 
       THE BATHROOM (bare except for a bar of soap, toothbrush,  
		       toothpaste, shampoo, towel, pack of disposable razors and can of   
		        
		shaving foam).
 
       Lombard opens a medicine cabinet; box of Q-tips, aspirins... 
 
        
		Looks into the small dustbin; a twisted toothpaste tube... 
 
       Gazes at the toothpaste tube  
		on the sink... half used, lid on...
 
       A DARKROOM (wealth of equipment, hanging negs, dry developing  
		       trays; piles of contact sheets and prints).  Lombard leafs through   
		        
		some prints... More girls in macabre poses... Checks the   
		       enlargerís neg carrier... empty... Leafs  
		through a pile of contact   
		       sheets... shots of London scenes: market crowds, STROLLERS IN   
		        
		PARKS, roadworkers...  
		       Leaving the room he distractedly glances at... A wall-mounted   
		        
		phone, NUMBERS SCRAWLED ON THE WALL around it.
 
       BACK IN THE SITTING ROOM.  
 
        
		A DESK DRAWER... Lombard leafs through a pile of papers... Leonís   
		       last bank statement:... in  
		credit by around £20...  Access card   
		       statement: credit limit £1,000.  Leon owes £997,50...   
		Bills...   
		       final Reminders...  
		       Another drawer... among personal  
		effects - silver lighter, cheap   
		       watch, Donald Duck keyring, pens - an ADDRESS BOOK and a BRITISH  
		       PASSPORT...
 
       Lombard flips through the address book:  
		mostly blank pages...
 
       Opens the passport: the same man as in the colour photo; eyes dark  
		       and haunted, long black hair plastered to his skull, mouth tightly   
		        
		shut...   
		       NAME: LEONARD JOZEF SPITZ...
 
       Lombard glances  
		out the dark window to the streetlamps below,   
		       pockets the address book, replaces the passport,  
		shuts the drawer,   
		       PUSHES THE ANSWERING MACHINE PLAY BUTTON and moves back to...
 
        
		THE BEDROOM... Lombard returns to the bedside cabinet, retrieves   
		       the colour photo and removes  
		it from its perspex stand...

       Thoughtful, Lombard pockets the photo and checks his watch....
 

        
		INT. THE FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT. EVENING. 
 
       Small, seedy, Ďcoolí place.  LOUD ROCK  
		MUSIC.  A foursome talking   
		       animatedly; couples eating quietly; a gay couple; a lone WAITRESS  
		       moving between the tables, some empty.  WE FIND...
 
        
		Lombard, out of place, waits for attention just inside the door,   
		       COLD EYES ASSESSING... By the  
		kitchen door behind the bar: PHIL   
		       (pony-tailed) chats with a young CHEF (messy uniform, smoking,  
		       rocking to the music). BOTH ARE CLEARLY HIGH ON DOPE.
 
                                  
		WAITRESS  
		                 Evening. Table for one?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (charming, milking  
		his French accent)  
		                 No. Thank you.  
		Could you tell me if Leon   
		                 Spitz is  
		here, please?
 
                                  
		WAITRESS  
		                   (she eyes him  
		up and down, surprised)  
		                 Leon? No.  
		Iím afraid he left.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Left? When? I just come from  
		his place and   
		                 there was no one there.  
		A neighbour of   
		                 his...
 
                                  
		WAITRESS  
		                 No. I meant he left as in  
		no longer works   
		                 here.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he affects a  
		worried frown)  
		                 Oh. This is... Weíd  
		arranged to meet   
		                 tonight and Iím  
		due to return to Paris   
		                 tomorrow...
 
                                  
		WAITRESS  
		                 Iím sorry...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Yes. You wouldnít know where  
		I could reach   
		                 him? We had to discuss  
		an exhibition of   
		                 his photographs  
		at my Paris gallery, you   
		                 see? I really  
		need to see him before I   
		                 leave. 
 
        
		After a beat, she shrugs, gestures for him to wait...  
		       She makes for the bar where she speaks to  
		Phil who eyeballs   
		       Lombard over her shoulder before striding across the room...  He   
		        
		stops in front of Lombard, hands in pockets, with a pissed-off   
		       frown: 
 
                                    
		PHIL  
		                 Welcome to the club.  
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Excuse me?
 
                                    
		PHIL  
		                 I hear youíre looking for Leon.   
		That   
		                 makes me, his old-lady, and  
		now you,   
		                 looking for the little bastard.  
		Leonís   
		                 gone, man. Vanished. You interested  
		in his   
		                 photographs?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Uh-huh.
 
                                    
		PHIL  
		                 No shit... Well, Iím afraid I  
		canít help   
		                 you.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I take it you donít know where  
		he is,   
		                 then?
 
                                    
		PHIL  
		                 Huh! You could always try Suicide  
		Bridge.  
		                   (off Lombardís  
		puzzled look)  
		                 You donít know Leon,  
		do you?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I know his work better than  
		I know him.
 
                                    
		PHIL  
		                 Let me put it this way then;  
		the   
		                 photographs and the man? One  
		and the same,   
		                 man, one and the same.  
		At best fucking   
		                 weird, at worst fucked-up  
		fucking weird.   
		                 Maybe you should think  
		yourself lucky.   
		                 Some folks just ainít  
		worth getting   
		                 involved with. And  
		Leon sure is one of   
		                 Ďem.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What about his girlfriend?
 
                                    
		PHIL  
		                 What about which girlfriend?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (describing the  
		girl from the photo)  
		                 Small, blond,  
		good-looking. She was with   
		                 him when  
		we met. She had a funny English   
		                 accent.
 
                                    
		PHIL  
		                 Oh. Thatíd be Rhian, a Welsh  
		chick he used   
		                 to lay at weekends.  
		She got wise and   
		                 dumped him months  
		ago... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Would you know where I might  
		reach her?
 
                                    
		PHIL  
		                 Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I donít  
		really   
		                 know her. Used to turn up  
		in a Transit van   
		                 on weekends, sell  
		old furniture at Camden.   
		                 Thatís how  
		come he only laid her at   
		                 weekends,  
		ha ha... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Could that be Camden Market?
 
                                    
		PHIL   
		                 Yeah. Why? Youíre going to look  
		for her...  
		                   Shit! You really  
		think his pictures   
		                 are that good?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 (his cold eyes focused on  
		Phil)  
		                 Fucked-up fucking weird.
 
        
		IN ON Phil; a confounded frown...  Should he laugh?
 

       EXT. OUTSIDE THE FOUR SEASONS.  
		NIGHT.
 
       RAIN.  Under a streetlamp, Lombard leafs through...  LEONíS   
		        
		ADDRESS BOOK: ĎRí page... It is blank... He frowns, pockets the   
		       book, turns to...
 

        
		EXT. CAMDEN MARKET. DAY.
 
       A GREY DAY. A CACOPHONY OF 60S AND 70S TRACKS AS WE SEE... A slow  
		       moving sea of trendiness drifts between the market stalls... WE   
		        
		FIND... 
 
       SEQUENCE of Lombard searching the faces of Ďantiquesí stall-  
		        
		holders through the market... Now peering at A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN...   
		       Glaring at a group of impeccable  
		YOUNG PUNKS, as if preserved from   
		       the 70ís, but French; their voices drift across: ĎHey, cíest  
		cool   
		       Áa, non?í...  Looking over an AGEING WOMAN in fishnet tights   
		        
		swaying to a Bob Dylan song...  Walking calmly on as people hurry   
		       from the RETURNING RAIN...  
		and on until, drenched and weary, he   
		       stops to light a cigarette near...
 
        
		A GUY with a plastic hood hops up and down behind his sorry   
		       display of wet cigarette lighters  
		on a box. A sodden handwritten   
		       sign reads: Ď5 LIGHTERS £1í
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (eyeing the sign,  
		without malice)  
		                 Is there really a  
		living in this?
 
       The young guy looks back at him, vexed, looks away...   
		        
		Blowing the smoke from his cigarette, Lombard eyes him, confused,   
		       then turns away to... A TRAMP  
		rummaging through a bin...
 

       INT. LEONíS FLAT, SITTING ROOM. DAY.
 
        
		Lombard is listening to the messages again...
 
                              
		ANSWERING MACHINE  
		                 MRS SPITZ: ... in  
		London next week and I   
		                 hope to hear

		you - I hope everythingís all right - long   
		                  
		beep. Rewind.
 
       Lombard picks up the receiver, is about to dial, changes his mind,   
		        
		presses the LAST RECALL BUTTON.  A few rings... No answer. He   
		       DIALS... 1-4-7-1...
 
                           
		PHONE COMPUTERIZED VOICE  
		                 Call box  
		number 01766 770 471 called on

       He hangs up, peers out the window... a flicker of thought...
 

        
		INT. LEONíS DARKROOM. DAY.
 
       A RINGING TONE. Lombard is on the wall-mounted phone, waiting,  
		his   
		       eyes on... THE NUMBERS SCRAWLED ON THE WALL: Amongst a few London   
		        
		numbers, several six digit numbers, WITH THE CODE 01766...
 
       No answer.  He redials...  
		After a few rings a little girlís voice:  
 
                             
		LITTLE GIRL #1 (OS)  
		                 Hello?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Hello. Who is this?  
		                    
		(A giggle... whispers... several girls   
		                     
		giggling; Lombard frowns...)  
		                 Hello?  
		Can I speak to your mother?
 
                             
		LITTLE GIRL #1 (OS)  
		                   (suppressing  
		giggles)  
		                 You have reached the wrong  
		number... This   
		                 is the speaking sheep.  
		At the third baa it   
		                 will be time  
		to have a pee - baa, baa,   
		                 baa!  
		                    
		(roars of girlish laughter)
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Listen you...
 
                             
		LITTLE GIRL #2 (OS)  
		                   (speaking  
		very fast, laughing)  
		                 This is the speaking  
		sheep. At the third   
		                 baa it will be  
		time for a pooh - baa, baa,   
		                 baa!  
		                    
		(she laughs and hangs up)
 
       IN ON Lombard staring at the handset, incensed; he dials again.
 
                     DIRECTORY  
		ENQUIRIES OPERATOR (OS)  
		                 Directory  
		enquiries. Can I help you?
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 Yes. Iím trying to reach

		01766 770 471. Let me check it for you,   
		                  
		sir.
 
       Waiting, Lombard takes out a pen, reaches for a CONTACT SHEET,   
		        
		absent- mindedly scans it... STROLLERS IN A PARK... He flips it   
		       round as:
 
                      
		DIRECTORY ENQUIRIES OPERATOR (OS)  
		                  
		Thereís nothing wrong with the line, sir.   
		                  
		Are you sure you have the right number?   
		                  
		770 471 is the number of a call box.
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 A call box? Thatís odd. Where  
		exactly?
 
                      
		DIRECTORY ENQUIRIES OPERATOR (OS)  
		                  
		Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.

		INT. STATIONARY TRIUMPH OUTSIDE LEONíS FLAT. DAY.
 
       RAIN DRUMS ON THE CAR.  Lombard scans  
		a road map...  
		       IN ON A ROAD MAP: up along the M1... onto the M6...blue lines   
		        
		snaking... move to another page... M54... A5... And on until...
 

       EXT. WELSH ROAD. AFTERNOON.
 
       Rain: A road sign: ĎPENRHYNDEUDRAETHí... The Triumph speeds   
		        
		past...
 

       EXT. PENRHYNDEUDRAETH, MAIN SQUARE. DAY.
 
        
		His back to a red phone box, Lombard scrutinizes... The village   
		       square: police station, Post  
		Office, Pub, ĎSparí grocer....  Itís   
		       quaint, quiet and dull.
 

        
		INT. SPAR GROCER. DAY.
 
       A couple of CUSTOMERS (country housewife types).  Lombard is  
		       talking to the GROCER (red-faced, lovable type)...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 ... She sold me a couple of  
		chairs in   
		                 London and Iíve come to  
		collect the   
		                 matching pair. Unfortunately,  
		I seem to   
		                 have mislaid her address.  
		Sheís small,   
		                 blond, attractive. I  
		think she drives a   
		                 Transit van...
 
                               
		LADY SHOPPER    
		                   (cutting  
		in behind him; Welsh accent)  
		                 Rhian  
		Gelli is the one he must be looking   
		                  
		for...
 

       EXT. SMALL COUNTRY ROAD. AFTERNOON.
 
       The  
		rain has stopped.  No houses in sight.  The Triumph crosses a   
		       small bridge... pulls  
		over by a cattle grid leading to A DIRT   
		       TRACK along a river...  
		        
		       INT. TRIUMPH.  Lombard checks a roughly drawn map on a paper   
		        
		bag...  
		         
		       EXT. The TRIUMPH bounces through puddles along the  
		TRACK...comes   
		       to...   
		       A SMALL CLEARING; A battered blue TRANSIT  
		VAN stands there, alone.  
		         
		       INT. TRIUMPH.  Lombard parks  
		by the Transit... lights a cigarette,   
		       eyeing...    
		       Up  
		ahead, A FOOTPATH WINDS UP RIVER INTO THE WILDS...
 

       EXT. FOOTPATH. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		UNDER DRIPPING TREES, Lombard walks along the footpath...   
		       reaches...
 

        
		EXT. RHIANíS COTTAGE. AFTERNOON.
 
       The bottom of a field with grazing sheep leading to a STONE  
		       COTTAGE, smoke rising from its chimney.  Out front RHIAN (in   
		        
		gumboots) splits logs with an axe.  An Asian boy, SHIVA, about 10,   
		       and a blond girl, CARYS,  
		about 6, play football near her.  
		       Lombard stops, observes them... starts upfield...  
		        
		IN ON the Asian boy; he spots Lombard, FREEZES WITH DEAD EYES.  
		       IN ON the blond girl; she turns  
		to Lombard; cries out to...  
		       IN ON Rhian; she follows the girls gaze... DREAD IN HER EYES...   
		        
		IN ON Lombard; he stops, frowns as...  
		       Yelling in WELSH, Rhian herds the two children into the  
		cottage...    
		       Lombard peers at the empty field for a moment, flicks his   
		        
		cigarette away and resumes walking... He stops again, STIFF.  
		       Rhian is back, heading his way, holding  
		a DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN.
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 This is private property. The  
		public   
		                 footpath is back to the left  
		of the   
		                 bridge.
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                   (as she stops  
		ten yards from him)  
		                 How are you, Rhian?
 
        
		IN ON Rhian; somethingís wrong... She dithers... RAISES THE   
		       SHOTGUN...
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 On-on the ground! Lie down on  
		the ground!
 
       Lombard scowls.  She FIRES ABOVE HIS HEAD.  He ducks... glares...
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Lie down on the ground, I said!
 
        
		Lombard reluctantly kneels down on the wet grass, hands up...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Itís wet. Will this do?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                   (a beat as she hesitates)  
		                  
		Whereís your wallet? Have you got a   
		                  
		wallet?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Is this some kind of mugging?  
		Because...
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Shut up! Whereís your wallet?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 In my jacket. Left inside  
		pocket.
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Reach for it and throw it to  
		me. And... My   
		                 fingerís on the trigger,  
		you hear!
 
       Lombard groans, reaches for his wallet, tosses it to her...  She   
		        
		picks it up and, struggling to keep the shotgun on him, searches   
		       it...  
 
        
		A FRENCH DRIVING LICENCE, BUSINESS CARD... She frowns, reading:  
		                    
		ďXAVIER LOMBARD, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR...Ē 
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 A private investigator... Youíre  
		not   
		                 Austrian?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Should I be?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                   (she tosses his  
		wallet back)  
		                 Whatís a French private  
		investigator doing   
		                 here?
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                   (reaching for  
		his wallet)  
		                 Can I get up now?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 No! What do you want here? How  
		do you know   
		                 me?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 As you know from speaking  
		to Phil, your   
		                 friend Leon has disappeared,  
		Rhian. His   
		                 family have hired me to  
		find him.
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 ...Leonís not here. How did  
		you get here?   
		                 Phil doesnít know where  
		I live.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Well, I obviously do. And  
		I also know that   
		                 Leonís not here,  
		Rhian. But I thought that   
		                 you might  
		know where I should look for   
		                 him.
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 You thought wrong. I havenít  
		seen Leon for   
		                 months.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Havenít you? Then why the  
		worried messages   
		                 on his answering  
		machine, Rhian? Iíd have   
		                 sworn you  
		expect him to be in trouble.
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 You-youíre wrong. I just called  
		to ask if   
		                 I could stay with him next  
		time Iím in   
		                 London. Thatís all.
 
        
		Lombard peers at her.  She looks away, uneasy... He pockets his   
		       wallet.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Well, since you have a gun,  
		Iíll take your   
		                 word for it. Now,  
		Iím going to stand up   
		                 and quietly  
		return to my car, all right?
 
       Rhian stays silent... He gets to his feet and, with a pissed-off  
		       frown, inspects his wet trouser legs, sweeps the dirt from them,   
		        
		saying:
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 By the way. Does your friend  
		Leon employ a   
		                 cleaner? His flat seems  
		remarkably clean,   
		                 for a single man  
		suspected of being back   
		                 on drugs.
 
        
		He peers at her... She stares, too perturbed to speak... He looks   
		       down again...   
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Never mind. You were my best  
		hope of   
		                 locating him, so I guess  
		Iím now out of a   
		                 job. I expect his  
		family will relay my   
		                 findings to  
		the police.  
		                   (he turns  
		to her again... grins)  
		                 I trust you  
		have a shotgun licence. My   
		                 apologies  
		forsounding Austrian. Goodbye,   
		                 Rhian.
 
        
		He turns and starts walking away, pulling his Gitanes from his   
		       pocket... 
 
                                 
		RHIAN (OS)  
		                 Wait...  
 
        
		Lombard stops, turns back...  IN ON Rhian; SHE IS CRYING,   
		       softly...
 

        
		INT. RHIANíS COTTAGE, FIRST FLOOR LANDING. AFTERNOON.
 
       Lombard stands behind... Rhian leans  
		against a closed door, calls   
		       IN WELSH:
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Carys? Tell Shiva not to be  
		scared. The   
		                 manís not going to come  
		in, all right?  
		                   (she stares  
		at Lombard, takes a deep   
		                     
		breath, opens the door and moves   
		                     
		aside)  
		                 My daughter Carys and her friend  
		Shiva, Mr   
		                 Lombard.
 
        
		Lombard looks into...  
		         
		       A CHILDRENíS BEDROOM: deep inside,  
		Carys stands protectively in   
		       front of Shiva, her arms hugging him behind her, sullen eyes on  
		       Lombard.  Shiva, much taller, cowers behind her, DEAD-EYED. 
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Shiva doesnít speak English  
		so we donít   
		                 know where heís from  
		or what his name is.   
		                 But we have  
		to call him something, so   
		                 Shiva it  
		is.  
		                   (a beat; she goes  
		on, in bursts)  
		                 He cost £15,000. Leon  
		bought him. From an   
		                 Austrian who  
		sells children to perverts.   
		                 Arenít  
		you glad you came, Mr Lombard?
 
       IN ON Lombard; a puzzled frown... He turns to...  
		        
		Rhian, lips trembling, through her tears, she eyes him   
		       defiantly...
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 What are you going to do now?  
		Call the   
		                 police?  Take him away?  
		I must warn you   
		                 heís terrified of  
		men, so...  
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 Shut up!
 
        
		Lombard turns to the children again... SMILES REASSURINGLY...
 

       INT. RHIANíS LIVING ROOM.  
		AFTERNOON.
 
       Cave-like but welcoming.  SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING UPSTAIRS.    
		        
		Lombard sits by a log fire, sombre, smoking, a cup in his hand,   
		       eyeing...  
		        
		Rhian, on the edge of an armchair, clasping a tea-mug, fighting   
		       tears - beautiful with fire-light  
		reflected in her tearful eyes...
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 ... I thought Iíd call the social  
		services   
		                 but... He took to my daughter,  
		started to   
		                 come out of his shell,  
		so... He needs   
		                 care. They donít...  
		                    
		(a beat, she sighs)  
		                 Anyway, thatís  
		all I know. Six weeks ago   
		                 Leon turned  
		up with Shiva, said he bought   
		                 him  
		in London from an Austrian, gave me   
		                  
		£3,000 for his keep and left saying he was   
		                  
		going to try to rescue another child...   
		                  
		Apparently, thereís plenty more where   
		                  
		Shiva came from. 
 
       Lombard scrutinizes her... He drinks - she has a heavy heart,   
		        
		needs time, no point in harassing her.  His eyes roam the walls...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Leonís?
 
        
		She follows his gaze to... A B&amp;W PORTRAIT of her - itís pleasant,   
		       sensual even, unlike  
		Leonís other work... She nods.  He smiles.    
		       She looks away.  
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 We didnít quite make it as lovers...  
		Leon   
		                 is a good man, though... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Did Leon tell you why he didnít  
		want the   
		                 police involved, Rhian?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 He just said he had good reasons.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Good reasons?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Thatís what he said. I tried  
		to dissuade   
		                 him... Told him I couldnít  
		take on another   
		                 child, that heíd  
		get into trouble... I   
		                 mean, people  
		who sell children... But he   
		                 wasnít  
		listening... I guess he finally   
		                 found  
		himself a crusade... His family   
		                 think  
		heís back on drugs, eh?  
		                    
		(off Lombardís smile: ĎIím afraid soí)  
		                  
		Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs.   
		                  
		Went through his self-destruct phase, you   
		                  
		know?  Things to come to terms with.   
		                  
		Demons to fight... Some peopleís minds are   
		                  
		gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leonís. He   
		                  
		did beat the drug, though. He did.
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 His mother would be pleased  
		to hear that.
 
                                   
		RHIAN   
		                 Yeah... But he didnít beat  
		the demons...  
		                   (off Lombardís  
		look)  
		                 A quarter of all the shoes sold  
		in Europe   
		                 are made by or retailed  
		through his   
		                 parentís leather empire.  
		All started from   
		                 a small shop in  
		the East End of London and   
		                 war reparation  
		money for holocaust   
		                 victims.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím afraid I donít understand.
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Theyíre German Jews. Came here  
		before the   
		                 war. They both lost all  
		their families in   
		                 extermination camps,  
		but they themselves   
		                 never went near  
		one. The idea that his   
		                 family wealth  
		was started with money he   
		                 believes  
		should have gone to camp   
		                 survivors  
		has been haunting Leon. Itís not   
		                  
		guilt, more of a curse...  
		                    
		(a beat)  
		                 And then thereís something  
		about his   
		                 parents being involved  
		with Nazi   
		                 hunters... But I think  
		thatís just one of   
		                 Leonís dark delusions...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (after a beat,  
		thoughtful)  
		                 Do you know Leonís parents  
		names?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Albert... Albert and Ethel.  
		Why?
 
       Lombard stays silent... CHILDISH LAUGHTER from upstairs...  Rhian   
		        
		glances up, down again, sends out a tense sigh, turns to Lombard   
		       and looks away again, gently  
		drying her tears on her sleeve.
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 What happens now, eh? 
 
       Lombard drags his cigarette, flicks it into the fire, pensive... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		       Who else knows about the boy?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 My sister... She lives in the  
		next valley.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Is she on the phone?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Yes...You-youíre not going to  
		take Shiva   
		                 away?
 
        
		Lombard takes out his wallet and a pen, finds his card and holds   
		       it out to her.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I canít think of a good reason  
		for it -   
		                 for now anyway. My number  
		if anything   
		                 happens. Whatís your  
		sisterís number?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                   (incredulous, reaching  
		for the card)  
		                 Oh, I... She just moved.  
		Iíve got her   
		                 new... Itís in my book  
		in the kitchen.   
		                 Wait... Thank you.
 
        
		Lombard watches her hurry out... He sighs, scans the room, rests   
		       his gaze on... Rhianís shotgun  
		against a wall... and stands,   
		       pocketing his wallet and pen...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 And you better stop greeting  
		strangers   
		                 with a shotgun. If Leonís  
		Austrian was   
		                 looking for you I reckon  
		heíd have found   
		                 you before I did.
 
                                   
		RHIAN   
		                 Iím sorry. Itís just you donít  
		look   
		                 local...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No sick people in the country,  
		huh?...   
		                 Just tell me one thing, Rhian.  
		Leonís   
		                 story about the boy? You just  
		took his   
		                 word for it?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                   (staring at him  
		from the kitchen   
		                     
		doorway)  
		                 Heíd come prepared. He had  
		something   
		                 besides Shiva... ĎSleeping  
		Beautyí. The   
		                 Disney film...  
		                    
		(a beat, off his look)  
		                 Well, it looked  
		like the Disney film. It   
		                 was something  
		else. I couldnít watch...
 
       IN ON Lombard; a thoughtful frown...
 

        
		EXT. PENRHYNDEUDRAETH, MAIN SQUARE. DUSK.
 
       Lombard is in the phone box, his Triumph parked  
		beside it. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Moreau? Laurent... Yeah. And  
		you?... Good.   
		                 Listen, I wonder if  
		you could check some   
		                 people in the  
		computer... Yes, again...    
		                 No,  
		theyíre new clients of mine, Albert   
		                  
		and...  
		                   (an approaching  
		car drowns his words)
 

       INT. LEONíS FLAT, SITTING ROOM. EVENING.
 
        
		Lombard reaches for the ĎSLEEPING BEAUTYí video box from the   
		       shelf... It looks like the real  
		thing... He opens it, pulls the   
		       tape out...   
		       IN ON... Lombard  
		turns it over in his hands; it is properly   
		       labelled...  
		       He  
		slots it into the VCR, presses PLAY...  The arrow lights up...   
		       A CLUNK...
 
        
		IN ON THE TV SCREEN: A LITTLE GIRLíS HEAD ON A PILLOW, ASLEEP...   
		       CUT TO: TWO MEN LAUGHING AT  
		A RESTAURANT TABLE. THEIR DIALOGUE, IN   
		       STIFF DUBBED ENGLISH: ďRenatta assures me sheís got something  
		       special in store for us this weekend.Ē ďWell, after last time   
		        
		there can only be one thing: the perfect love machine, ha-ha...Ē
 

       INT. A BRASSERIE, SOHO.  
		NIGHT.  
		       Lombard stands in the doorway, eyes searching... A late night hang   
		        
		out; tired, lonely people, whispered conversations... NATHALIE   
		       (young, elegant, very French)  
		sits at a table over a coffee,   
		       reading a ďLe MondeĒ, smoking...
 
        
		Lombard settles opposite her.  She looks up, eyeballs him,   
		       deadpan.
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 You look like shit, Xavier.
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; HE DOES, THERE IS ANGER IN HIS EYES.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Comment vas-tu, Nathalie?
 
        
		Nathalie just stares; a lot of things flow between their eyes,   
		       things they donít need to speak  
		about.  She frowns...
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Quíest-ce que tu veux?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Un Autrichien. Negociant en  
		prť-  
		                 pubescents.
 
        
		Nathalie raises her brows, sneers, turns back to her newspaper.
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Les histoires díenfants ne  
		míintťressent   
		                 pas, Xavier.
 
        
		Lombard grins - he knew she was going to say something like that.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Whatís an hour of your time  
		worth these   
		                 days, Nathalie?  
		                    
		(she looks up again, softly blows out   
		                     
		smoke)  
		                 Combien, Nathalie!
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Cinq cents.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Viens.
 
        
		As Lombard stands, Nathalie looks beyond him...  He looks back,   
		       sees...   
		        
		IN THE DOORWAY: TWO MEN (middle-aged, well-groomed) stand   
		       searching the room.  On seeing  
		Nathalie one of them beams. 
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Jíai bien peur quíil te faudra  
		attendre.  
		                   (off Lombardís  
		look: ĎWhen?í)  
		                 Pas avant la matinťe.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Tu sais oý me trouver.
 
        
		Lombard turns and makes for the door, SCOWLING AT THE TWO MEN now   
		       making for Nathalieís table...  
		ďMichelle! Long time no see, ha-  
		       ha...Ē
 

       INT. LOMBARDíS  
		OFFICE. MORNING.
 
       Lombard, asleep, slumped at his desk, head on the table between a   
		        
		glass, a bottle of Cognac, the ĎDisneyí tape, a wad of £50 notes.  
		       BANG! A red folder hits the  
		desk.  Lombard starts, sits up, bleary-  
		       eyed...  Jane (coat, handbag) gazes at him,  
		frowning.
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Your door was open. This... This  
		women was   
		                 downstairs, ringing your  
		bell.
 
       Lombard looks past her... Nathalie is in the doorway, a laconic   
		        
		smile on her lips...  Their eyes lock... Silence... Jane waits,   
		       then, indicating the red  
		folder:
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Your accounts. They just need  
		your   
		                 signature. Iíve got to go to  
		work.   
		                 Goodbye.
 
        
		And she edges her way to the door... IN ON Jane as she passes   
		       Nathalie; threatened, searching  
		eyes... IN ON Nathalie; a smirk.
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		       Bye. And thanks...  
		       Nathalie gently closes the door,  
		eyes Lombard who shakes himself   
		       awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Oý est passť ton salon?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Mon bureau coŻtait trop cher.
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Eh bien... Tíes sŻr que tías  
		besoin de   
		                 moi?  
		                    
		(off Lombardís look: ĎWhat?í)  
		                 La petite  
		mía líair assez bien foutue,   
		                 non?
 
        
		Lombard frowns, grabs the £50 notes and videotape from his desk   
		       and starts across the room...   
		Barely stopping, he grabs her hand   
		       and pushes the money into it, then goes on towards the kitchen.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Cafť?
 
                                                             
		CUT TO:
 
       Lombard leans against the window, smoking, a coffee in his hands,   
		        
		eyeing...  
		       Through the kitchen doorway: Nathalie sits at the table, smoking,   
		        
		watching the TV screen above the fridge...  
		       IN ON her profile; her eyebrows twitch, her cheek muscles  
		tense...  
		       IN ON Lombard; quiet satisfaction in his eyes...
 

        
		INT. LOMBARDíS KITCHEN. MORNING.
 
       He switches the TV off, turns to Nathalie... She gazes  
		at the   
		       ĎSleeping Beautyí box on the table, her hand trembling just a   
		        
		little as she lights a new cigarette.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Alors? 
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Alors quoi?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Le montage, líemballage. Not  
		your regular   
		                 street muck, is it?  
		This is collectorsí   
		                 stuff. How much  
		would it cost me?
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 A líachat, trois ou quatre  
		mille. En   
		                 location, cinq cent. Mais  
		Áa pourrait   
		                 faire plus. Je ne sais  
		pas. Cíest pas   
		                 vraiment mon truc.  
		                    
		(off his look: ĎAnd...?í)  
		                 I donít  
		know any Austrian, Xavier.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 But maybe you know someone  
		who does. An   
		                 Austrian, in London,  
		dealing in kids and   
		                 snuff videos.  
		How many can there be? These   
		                 people  
		supply to order. He has to be   
		                 known,  
		reachable.
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Then why donít you reach  
		him?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I donít have your credentials,  
		Nathalie.
 
       He looks hard into her eyes...  She looks back, coldly, then takes   
		        
		a drag from her cigarette, eyes on the video box again... She   
		       looks up, sneers, then grins:
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Can you afford a room in  
		a proper hotel?  
		                   (off his  
		look)  
		                 It will look better. I also  
		need more   
		                 money; five hundred in  
		an envelope and the   
		                 same again for  
		my time.
 

       INT. WEST END NIGHTCLUB. NIGHT.
 
       LOUD  
		MUSIC.  Happy groups around tables... Sweaty people writhing   
		       on the dance floor... Couples  
		snogging... We FIND...   
		       At a table near the bar: Lombard sits, smoking, watching as...   
		        
		Nathalie works her way across the room to a table where a MIDDLE-  
		       AGED MAN (suit) and a YOUNG  
		WOMAN (a prostitute) sit.  The man   
		       eyes Nathalie, grins, signals the young woman... She  
		scowls at   
		       Nathalie, stands and makes for the bar.  Nathalie sits, pulls an   
		        
		envelope from her handbag and puts it in front of the man as...   
		       Passing Lombardís table, the  
		young woman turns, stops, smiles,   
		       steps towards him.  He smiles, politely...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím afraid Iím otherwise engaged.
 

        
		EXT. WEST END NIGHTCLUB/PICCADILLY CIRCUS. NIGHT.
 
       Lombard and Nathalie emerge from the club...  
		walk into the dark...
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Youíre a trustworthy sicko  
		of mine whoís   
		                 heard only good things  
		about the   
		                 Austrianís products and  
		doesnít want   
		                 anything else. He claims  
		not to know of   
		                 any Austrian but heíll  
		call around.   
		                 Thereís no refund if  
		he fails to deliver.   
		                 You should get  
		a call tonight.
 
       They go on walking in heavy silence...  reach PICCADILLY CIRCUS.   
		        
		Nathalie stops, flags down a BLACK TAXICAB.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Is he your pimp?
 
        
		She looks straight into his eyes.  He smiles, sadly, as the cab   
		       pulls up beside them and  
		the CAB DRIVER opens his window.
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 We are so alike, Xavier.  
		Still, sometimes   
		                 I wonder which one  
		of us is the ugliest.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (after a beat,  
		opening the cab door)  
		                 If you can,  
		send me a receipt.
 
       Nathalie smirks, gets into the cab, says to the driver:
 
                                  
		NATHALIE  
		                 Clarence Square. And hurry,  
		Iím late.
 
       Lombard shuts the door and the cab pulls away...    
		        
		He stands for a moment, gazing at... EROS, silhouetted against   
		       neon; homeless youths on the steps  
		around it... He turns away,   
		       down Piccadilly, towards...  
		         
		        
		ĎLE MERIDIANí HOTEL, glistening expensively in the dark night...
 

       INT. LE MERIDIAN, ROOM  
		142. NIGHT.
 
       Lombard lies on the bed, shoes and jacket off, the phone on his   
		        
		chest, dialling.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Moreau? Cíest moi. Alors...
 
                                
		MOREAU (O.S.)  
		                 Salut, Laurent. Ouais.  
		It wasnít easy but   
		                 I got what you  
		wanted through Interpol.   
		                 Say, whatís  
		your business with these   
		                 Spitzes?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 They lost their son. Why?
 
                                 
		MOREAU (OS)  
		                 It appears that in their  
		younger days they   
		                 were actively involved  
		with a shady German 
 
                 group of  
		Nazi hunters known as ďNever   
		                 ForgetĒ.  
		Over the years weíre talking   
		                 about  
		a dozen or so execution-type   
		                 killings.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Are they still operative?
 
                                 
		MOREAU (OS)  
		                 Their last suspected kill  
		occurred two   
		                 years back, though your  
		Spitzes now   
		                 probably do no more than  
		bankroll the   
		                 group. Still, Iíd watch  
		my step. These   
		                 people are well-connected,  
		Laurent; former   
		                 Israeli prime minister,  
		etc. The ladyís   
		                 also president of  
		an international Zionist   
		                 organisation...  
		Anyway, you get the   
		                 picture.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Mossad?
 
                                 
		MOREAU (OS)  
		                 Itís a good guess...
 
        
		Lombard frowns... Mutters a ĎThanks, Moreauí... and replaces the   
		       handset, thoughtful...   
		The phone RINGS almost immediately. He   
		       picks it up: ĎHello?í.
 
                                 
		MAN (O.S.)  
		                 I met your friend earlier.  
		You got a pen?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (grabbing a pen  
		from the bedside   
		                     
		table)  
		                 Go ahead.
 
                                  
		MAN (OS)  
		                 You want Mr Friedman - 0171  
		435 6268. Say   
		                 youíre calling about  
		the puppies.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Friedman - 0171 435 6268.  
		The puppies...? 
 
                                 
		MAN (O.S.)  
		                 Yeah. You saw the ad at  
		Georgeís, alright.
 
       The man has gone.  Lombard dials... A few rings... a woman   
		        
		answers, ĎHello?í
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Can I speak to Mr Friedman?
 
        
		A few clicks, as if the line is being diverted... a few rings...   
		       then AN OLD MANíS VOICE, with  
		a GERMAN ACCENT: ĎYes?í
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím calling about the puppies.
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                   (silence,  
		then:)  
		                 Have we done business before?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I saw the ad at Georgeís.  
		                    
		(no reply)  
		                 Iím passing through town  
		and Iím in a   
		                 hurry.
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 May I have your phone  
		number?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Why?
 
                               
		FRIEDMAN (O.S.)  
		                 This is a bad line.
 
                                                             
		CUT TO:
 
       Lombard sits on the edge of the bed, lighting a Gitane, the phone   
		        
		on his lap.  It rings.  He answers: ďYes?Ē
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 What sort of puppy are  
		you looking for?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What sort have you got?
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 Pups. Bitches. From  
		three to twelve   
		                 months.  Trained  
		and untrained ones. White   
		                 and brown  
		ones. You understand?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (after a beat,  
		voice calm)  
		                 Yeah.
 
                               
		FRIEDMAN  (OS)  
		                 We also provide  
		24-hour after-sale   
		                 service. Were  
		the puppy to fall sick or   
		                 accidently  
		die, we would unburden you, you   
		                 understand?
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 Yes... Good, good... 
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 So, what are you looking  
		for?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What about an untrained pup,  
		white...
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 How much of a hurry  
		are you in?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Tomorrow?
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 Iím afraid the only  
		pups currently   
		                 available at such  
		notice are brown and   
		                 trained. But  
		they are all very cheerful   
		                 and have  
		been thoroughly checked for   
		                 diseases...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I see. How much?
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 Fifteen for a straight  
		delivery. Twenty   
		                 with the provision  
		of a safe place.   
		                 Visitors tend to  
		find the second option   
		                 more convenient.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 ... Fine. Iíll go for the  
		safe place.
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 Have the money ready  
		by 11am. Weíll call   
		                 you.  
 
        
		Lombard puts the receiver down, checks...  HIS WATCH: 00:10...
 

       INT. DE MORAES DRAWING  
		ROOM. NIGHT.
 
       The butler, in his dressing gown, waits in the open doorway   
		        
		wearily watching...  
		       Lombard, holding a briefcase, stands staring into the cold   
		        
		fireplace...  
		       Deborah - clinging robe, eyes puffy with sleep but still made up   
		        
		(sheís clearly been drinking) - comes in past the butler (who   
		       closes the door behind her), glowers  
		at Lombard and makes for the   
		       sofa.  In a croaking voice:
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I wonít comment on the time  
		but youíll   
		                 understand if I donít  
		tell you to sit   
		                 down. Now, spare  
		me the apology and get to   
		                 the point,  
		will you, Mr Lombard.  
		                    
		(she sits down and lights a cigarette)
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím afraid I have bad news,  
		Mr De Moraes.   
		                 I have reason to believe  
		your brotherís in   
		                 trouble.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 For your information, Mr Lombard,  
		trouble   
		                 is possibly the one thing  
		Leon is capable   
		                 of getting into all  
		by himself. Though I   
		                 doubt he will  
		not ultimately fail even at   
		                 that.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (smiles, sighs,  
		retaliates:)  
		                 I donít know. He seems  
		to delight in so   
		                 much sisterly love,  
		he might become   
		                 determined.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Oh-oh! Touchť, Mr Lombard!  
		But tell me,   
		                 what would you know  
		about sisterly love,   
		                 eh?  
		                    
		(a beat, with an icy glare)  
		                 No. Donít.  
		You might get confused speaking   
		                 of  
		things you donít understand and we need   
		                  
		you clear- headed, at least until youíve   
		                  
		done what we are paying you for.
 
                                  
		LOMBARD    
		                 Now you are confusing  
		me, Mrs De Moraes.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Can it be that easy?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Can it be that you want your  
		brother   
		                 found?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Anything is possible.
 
        
		Lombard peers at her... chooses not to bother... He opens his   
		       briefcase... throws ĎSLEEPING BEAUTYí  
		onto the low table in front   
		       of her:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I found this at your brotherís.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (she glances at  
		the cover, then:)  
		                 Disney! How inter...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Itís a snuff movie. Prime  
		paedophile   
		                 material. Iím told it  
		retails at around   
		                 £4,000.  
		                    
		(as Deborah frowns at the tape, rigid)  
		                  
		I see you donít require a definition.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 You... You found that at Leonís?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thereís more. Your brother  
		also purchased   
		                 a young boy for £15,000.
 
        
		Deborah looks back at him, confounded... LOST FOR WORDS for once.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You seem surprised. Could  
		it be you donít   
		                 think that badly  
		of him after all?  
		                   (off  
		her silence)  
		                 You neednít worry. It  
		seems his motives   
		                 were pure. From  
		what I can make out he   
		                 bought the  
		boy to rescue him from further   
		                 abuse.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 What... What are you talking  
		about?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Your brother got mixed up  
		with child   
		                 procurers  and tried  
		to make this world a   
		                 better place,  
		Mrs De Moraes. And having   
		                 rescued  
		one little life he unwisely set   
		                 out  
		to repeat the exercise.  
		                    
		(a beat)  
		                 You donít mess around with  
		child   
		                 procurers. Right now my guess  
		is heís   
		                 either on the run, held captive,  
		or dead.  
		                   (off her horrified  
		frown)  
		                 I understand your misgivings,  
		Mrs De   
		                 Moraes. But Iíve seen the  
		boy and made   
		                 telephone contact with  
		the man Leon bought   
		                 him from. If  
		anyone knows what happened to   
		                 your  
		brother it will be that man. Which   
		                  
		leads me to why Iím here at such a late   
		                  
		hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this   
		                  
		morning.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Excuse me?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I need the money to smooth  
		my way, you   
		                 understand? Now, have  
		you got that sort of   
		                 cash here or  
		do we need to meet in the   
		                 morning?
 
        
		Deborah stares at him, thinking hard... her amazement turns into   
		       indignation... Lombard pre-empts  
		what he thinks is coming:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I will of course do my best  
		to hang onto   
		                 it.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Where is it?  
		                    
		(off his look: ĎWhat?í; shouting)  
		                  
		He. The boy you said my brother bought!    
		                  
		Where is he?
 
                                  
		LOMBARD    
		                 I canít tell you that  
		yet. But heís being   
		                 well looked after.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Oh no. Youíll have to do better  
		than that,   
		                 Mr Lombard.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (angry)  
		                  
		Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let   
		                  
		down it might be, your brotherís not back   
		                  
		to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable   
		                  
		as he is, he probably grew tired of   
		                  
		healthy girls in grisly poses, tried   
		                  
		moving on to bigger things, came upon more   
		                  
		than heíd bargained for and somehow   
		                  
		fancied he could take on the real world.   
		                  
		Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way   
		                  
		to that thing now sitting on your table...   
		                  
		Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told   
		                  
		you I had bad news...
 
       Deborah scowls... Lombard waits, giving her time to calm down   
		        
		but... It seems too much for her...  She laughs nervously, looks   
		       at the video, shakes her  
		head:
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Not Leon...
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; a puzzled frown... 
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 How dare you...  
		                    
		(a beat, eyeing the tape again)  
		                 You  
		donít know this tape belongs to my   
		                  
		brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The question now is whether  
		or not your   
		                 brother still owns anything,  
		Mrs De   
		                 Moraes.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (glaring at him)  
		                  
		No. The question now is how long itís   
		                  
		going to take you to get out of here, Mr   
		                  
		Lombard.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Excuse me?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Get out of my house. Youíre  
		fired, Mr   
		                 Lombard.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (an angry frown...  
		Then, calmly:)  
		                 Perhaps I should come  
		back when youíre...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (cutting in, getting  
		to her feet)  
		                 No. Youíre fired! Get  
		out of my house. And   
		                 take your sick  
		tape with you...
 
       And she picks up the videotape and hurls it at him...  He ducks,   
		        
		turns to see... THE TAPE CRASH AGAINST THE WALL... turns back,   
		       bemused...
 
        
		       Deborah now watches him in cold disdain.  She calls to the door: 
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Laurence!
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                   (peering hard  
		at her)  
		                 I was hired by your parents,  
		Mrs De   
		                 Moraes.  
		        
		 
 
                                  
		DEBORAH   
		                 The family hired you and  
		I have just fired   
		                 you, Mr Lombard.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (long beat as  
		he looks back at her,   
		                     
		then:)  
		                 Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why  
		should such   
		                 well-connected people  
		as you hire a small-  
		                 time French detective  
		to look for their   
		                 missing son, Mrs  
		De Moraes?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Huh! Who do you think we are,  
		Mr Lombard?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Couldnít Nazi hunters do the  
		job?
 
       Deborah sizes him up, surprised, then... To the butler in the   
		        
		doorway:
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 See Mr Lombard to the door,  
		Laurence. He   
		                 is leaving.
 
        
		Lombard peers at her, realises he wonít get anywhere now... He   
		       holds up a hand appealing to the  
		butler to wait, searches his   
		       pockets, pulls out a ĎLE MERIDIANí MATCHBOOK, throws it on the   
		        
		table and turns for the door.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iíll be in room 142 until  
		11am. Keep the   
		                 tape.
 

        
		EXT. DE MORAES DRIVEWAY. NIGHT.
 
       ĎMerde!í In the rain, Lombard throws his briefcase into  
		his   
		       Triumph.
 

       INT. LE MERIDIAN, ROOM 142. MORNING.
 
        
		THE EMPTY BRIEFCASE OPEN on the undisturbed bed... A full ashtray   
		       by the phone and... Lombard  
		leans against the window, smoking,   
		       staring through rain streaked glass...   
		        
		BELOW: traffic and pedestrians swarming over wet Piccadilly...
 
       The phone rings.... Lombard  
		turns and snatches it up: ĎYES?í
 
                               
		MANíS VOICE (OS)  
		                   (with  
		a YORKSHIRE ACCENT)  
		                 Itís about the  
		puppy. You got the money?  
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat, he glances  
		at the briefcase)  
		                 Yeah.  
 
                               
		MANíS VOICE (OS)  
		                 At what time will  
		you be available?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (glancing at his  
		watch: 11am)  
		                 Three oíclock.

		                 ĎLe Mercuryí. Newman

		INT. LOMBARDíS BANK. DAY.
 
       Lombard empties his Safety Deposit Box, pockets bundles of used  
		       £20 notes...  
		       The box is almost empty now.  Lombard looks  
		over the remaining   
		       items...   
		       More money (mostly French)...  
		AN OLD BLUE FRENCH PASSPORT...
 
       IN ON Lombard; hurt in his eyes...  He slams the box  
		shut: CLANG!
 

       INT. LOMBARDíS OFFICE. DAY.  
		       Lombard reaches  
		into the pebble bottom of his aquarium, pulls out   
		       a flat plastic- wrapped bundle... THE DOORBELL  
		RINGS... He shakes   
		       the bundle dry... shoves it in a desk drawer... looks out the   
		        
		window...   
		       Through the rain: A BLUE ASTON MARTIN is doubleparked down below.  
 

        
		INT. FIRST FLOOR LANDING, LOMBARDíS FLAT. DAY.
 
       Lombard stands in his doorway, looking down  
		into...  
		       The Stairwell: Deborah, looking rough, but in an attractive suit,   
		        
		climbs the stairs... She stops on the landing, silently holds out   
		       a Marks &amp; Spencers  
		bag...  
		       Lombard takes it, glances inside: BUNDLES OF PRISTINE £50 NOTES...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I still donít buy your story  
		but I figured   
		                 it canít do any harm  
		to let you go on with   
		                 your enquiry.  
		Besides, if you do turn out   
		                 to be  
		nothing but a cheap little   
		                 extortioner,  
		we could always get the right   
		                 people  
		onto you. I trust you know who I am   
		                  
		talking about.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (grinning)  
		                  
		You drive a hard bargain.
 
       Deborah opens her mouth, wavers, turns and starts down the stairs.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Youíve got your money. Do  
		your work.
 

       INT. LOMBARDíS OFFICE. DAY.
 
       Lombard  
		at his desk, writing; over his shoulder we glimpse a few   
		       words:    
		                   
		ĎRhian... Penrhyndeudraeth... Friedman...í
 
       IN ON a wastepaper bin; the wrapping from the  
		aquarium bundle...  
		       IN ON a corner of the desk; A HANDGUN AND SILENCER...   
		                                        
		       Lombard folds the note, puts it into an envelope addressed to...    
		        
		Deborah De Moraes... inserts this envelope into another

		INT. JANEíS FLAT. DAY.
 
       A square of floor just inside Janeís door... an envelope is slid

       EXT. WEST END STREET. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		HEAVY RAIN. A smart, busy street lined with restaurants and   
		       cafes... A black cab halts the traffic  
		as it pulls up...   
		       Lombard, with his briefcase, gets out and, as the cab drives on,   
		        
		stands on the kerb, peering at...  
		       Across the road: ĎLE MERCURYí restaurant - elegant facade, tinted  
		       windows.  A WHITE MERCEDES sits in front; inside a YOUNG DRIVER   
		        
		reads a paper.   
		       Lombard checks his watch: 14:52.
 

       INT.  
		ĎLE MERCURYí. AFTERNOON.
 
       Dim lighting.  Empty tables.  A MUSCLY BARMAN in a white  
		shirt   
		       polishes wine glasses... He looks up...  
		       Lombard stands  
		inside the door, eyeing across the room...  
		       The only customer: PETER (fat, grey-hair, smart suit)  
		looks back   
		       at Lombard while talking into a mobile phone, a half-eaten ice   
		        
		cream sundae of him.
 
                                   
		BARMAN  
		                 We open at six.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Peter?
 
        
		The barman eyeballs Lombard... nods towards Peter... Lombard sends   
		       him a stony grin and makes  
		for...   
		       Peter, keeping his eyes on Lombard, pockets his phone and... as   
		        
		Lombard reaches his table, checks his watch. 
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                 Five to three. Youíre early.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Should I come back in five  
		minutes?
 
       IN ON Peter; he scoffs... glances at the briefcase, indicates the   
		        
		seat opposite. 
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                 May I offer you a drink?
 
        
		Lombard slips into the seat, putting the briefcase on the table.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No. Iíd like to see what Iím  
		buying.
 
       Peter raises his brows... then casually resumes eating his   
		        
		sundae...
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                 I gather weíve done business  
		with a friend   
		                 of yours?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat; then  
		deadpan)  
		                 Have you?
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                   (swallowing ice-cream,  
		perplexed)  
		                 The person who put us in  
		touch seems to   
		                 think so.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I donít recollect mentioning  
		a friend.
 
       Peter swallows more ice-cream, puts his spoon down, dabs his lips   
		        
		with a napkin, reaches for the briefcase, turns it round, opens it   
		       just enough to look inside...   
		He shuts it again, turns it back to   
		       Lombard and lights a cigarette.
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                 Your lady friend did.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The ladyís not a friend. Sheís  
		a whore.  
		                   (he pauses, staring  
		at Peter)  
		                 Someone at a special screening  
		I attended   
		                 mentioned certain goods  
		could be got from   
		                 an Austrian here  
		in London. And not just   
		                 movies.
 
        
		Peter scrutinizes Lombard, calmly, then breaks into a smile.
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                 And while visiting our fair  
		city you...  
		                   (off Lombardís  
		look: ĎThatís rightí)  
		                 An Austrian?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 An Austrian.
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                 An Austrian... Not much to go  
		on, is it?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (impatiently)  
		                  
		Questions can amount to revelations. Now,   
		                  
		Iíd hate to think I was made to come here   
		                  
		carrying a substantial amount of money in   
		                  
		order to be subjected to a cross-  
		                  
		examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe   
		                  
		we had a deal. Do we? 
 
       Peter eyes Lombard, takes a drag from his cigarette, peering at...  
		       LOMBARDíS WEDDING BAND... He nods his head in agreement... 
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                 Will you be alone?  
		                    
		(off Lombardís frown: ĎWhat?í)  
		                 The  
		merchandise. Is it just you or...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iíll be alone.
 
                                    
		PETER  
		                   (a beat; he grins)  
		                  
		You must agree to be blindfolded...  
		                    
		(off Lombardís look: ĎWhat?í)  
		                 Just  
		for the journey. It might appear   
		                  
		unseemly - youíre the paying customer -   
		                  
		but ordinarily clients come with some kind   
		                  
		of endorsement.
 
       Lombard glances at his briefcase... Peter follows his eyes...  
		        
		Lombard looks up, eyes hard... Peter gestures he is sorry but...
 

       EXT. ĎLE MERCURYí. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		RAIN.  Lombard gets into the back of the Mercedes...  Peter behind   
		       him...
 

        
		INT/EXT. MOVING MERCEDES/AROUND LONDON. AFTERNOON.
 
       IN ON Lombard; tight-lipped, he looks  
		down at...   
		       In his hands: a deck of POLAROIDS... He shuffles them slowly...   
		        
		SIX SHOTS OF SIX YOUNG BOYS, each with a number on the top left   
		       corner; all aged between 7 and  
		11, all naked, all standing limply   
		       before the same dark backdrop.  
		        
		Lombard hands the polaroids to Peter without looking at him...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Number six.
 
        
		Peter pockets the photos, dials on his mobile...   
		       Lombard turns to the window to watch LONDONíS  
		RAINY STREETS pass   
		       by... We HOLD on his grim face as... 
 
                                 
		PETER  (OS)  
		                 Number six. Weíre  
		on our way...  
		                   (a beat,  
		then, to the driver)  
		                 Stop in a quiet  
		spot when you can, Jack...
 
       Lombard turns...  Peter is unfolding a black hood...  
		        
		EXT.  THE MERCEDES IS STATIONARY IN A QUIET STREET...  
		       INT. MERCEDES.  Lombard stretches  
		out on the floor between the   
		       front and rear seats, holding the hood... Peter, sitting in the  
		       front now, looks back...  
		         
		        
		IN ON Lombard; he peers at Peter, then, as he puts the hood on:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Drive carefully...
 
        
		DISSOLVE TO BLACK as Lombardís face disappears into the hood.
 

       INT. ROOM 40. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		IN ON Lombard (standing) as the hood is removed from his head...
 
                               
		MANíS VOICE (OS)  
		                   (Yorkshire  
		accent, as on phone   
		                     
		earlier)  
		                 I hope your journey wasnít  
		too unpleasant.
 
       Lombard squints in the neon light... looks down...    
		        
		MARTIN (burly, 50s, in shirtsleeves) sits behind a table, looking   
		       him over.  
		        
		Lombard turns to survey... AN AUSTERE, IMPERSONAL BEDROOM...   
		       On a single bed a muscly GIANT in  
		a tight suit sits FOLDING THE   
		       HOOD... He greets Lombardís gaze with a stony nod and tucks the  
		       hood into his pocket...  Lombard turns back to Martin:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What happens now?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 We conclude our transaction.
 
        
		IN ON Martin; he peers at Lombard... Lombard steps forward, puts   
		       the briefcase on the table,  
		opens it, swivels it towards...  
		       Martin looks inside, picks up a bundle of £50s, pulls one note  
		       out, examines it, then proceeds to transfer the rest from   
		        
		briefcase to table, saying tonelessly:
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 The roomís yours for 24 hours.  
		Itís sound-   
		                 proofed, stocked up with  
		food, drink and   
		                 other things you  
		might find useful. You   
		                 can do anything  
		you like.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Anything at all?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Anything at all. I presume  
		you wonít want   
		                 to take the boy with  
		you when youíre   
		                 finished?  
		                    
		(he shuts the briefcase, pushes it   
		                     
		back towards Lombard, looks up)  
		                 Thereís  
		a £500 fee for disposal. The boy   
		                  
		is yours, you understand?
 
       Lombard nods, jaw clenched... Martinís eyes linger on him...
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Vous Ítes FranÁais?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Does it matter?
 
        
		MARTIN scrutinizes Lombard a little longer, then motions towards   
		       the Giant and turns his attention  
		back to the money.
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Heíll take you to the boy.  
		Donít forget   
		                 your briefcase.
 
        
		And Martin starts counting the money, his fingers expertly racing   
		       through the notes... Lombard  
		turns to the giant who stands up... 
 

       INT. CORRIDOR. AFTERNOON
 
        
		IN ON A GOLD NUMBER 40 as the door is slammed shut. 
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 This way.
 
        
		And Lombard, briefcase in hand, follows the giant down a   
		       windowless corridor, past more doors...  
		41... 42... 43... until...   
		       DOOR NUMBER 46... ďDO NOT DISTURBĒ on the handle...   
		        
		The giant unlocks the door with his back to Lombard who frowns   
		       at...  
		        
		Through the giantís tight jacket: THE LINES OF A HOLSTER STRAP...   
		       The giant opens the door and  
		steps aside to let Lombard through:
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Iíll lock behind you. Pick up  
		the intercom   
		                 when youíre finished  
		or if you need   
		                 anything, alright?
 
        
		Lombard pauses, then steps into...
 

       INT. ROOM 46, INNER CORRIDOR. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		A narrow passage to a PADDED DOOR... Lombard waits as the outer   
		       door is locked... turns to the  
		padded door, opens it... THE SOUND   
		       OF A BUGS BUNNY CARTOON...
 

        
		INT. ROOM 46. AFTERNOON.
 
       Lombard stands just inside the padded door, peering at...  
		        
		In an armchair: BOY NUMBER 6 (T-shirt, short trousers, plimsolls)   
		       looks back at Lombard, apprehensive  
		but docile...  ĎBugs Bunnyí is   
		       on the TV in front of him.  Lombard raises his voice  
		above the TV: 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Do you speak English?  
		                    
		(the boy frowns)  
		                 FranÁais?
 
        
		No reaction.  Lombard sighs... scans the room... Padded walls,   
		       mirrored ceiling, a huge  
		bed, small drinks bar, a hifi, video   
		       player, fridge, shelves of porn videos and literature, a  
		dark   
		       doorway... And the boy again, still gazing at him...  Lombard   
		        
		smiles, shuts the padded door and crosses to...  
		         
		       The dark  
		doorway: he turns on the light; A WINDOWLESS BATHROOM.  
		         
		       He  
		walks to the fridge... stocked with food and drinks...  
		       Opens a cupboard: S&amp;M paraphernalia,  
		sex aids, aphrodisiacs,   
		       tranquillizers, a still camera, video camera, etc... all neatly   
		        
		stacked.  
		         
		       He eyes the boy again... turns to the fridge, opens  
		it, reaches   
		       for a chocolate bar... makes for the boy, squats and hands it to   
		        
		him with a reassuring smile...  The boy warily reaches for it.  IN   
		       ON Lombard as he  
		peers with a frown into...    
		         
		       THE BOYíS EYES: dilated  
		pupils - heís obviously been sedated.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (pointing to the  
		bathroom)  
		                 You go in there. In there,  
		yes....
 
       The boy frowns, stands... docilely walks into the bathroom and out   
		        
		of sight...  
		       Lombard peers after him, then straightens up and follows him...  
		        
		       THE BATHROOM: the boy stands by the bath eyeing Lombard in the   
		        
		doorway.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (pointing to a  
		stool)  
		                 Itís all right, huh. You sit  
		down. Sit.  
		                   (the boy timidly  
		sits down)  
		                 Good. You eat your chocolate.  
		Itís yours.
 
       He points at the chocolate in the boys hand, makes eating   
		        
		motions...  The boy doesnít seem to want to eat...  Lombard brings   
		       his finger to his  
		lips...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You stay here and be quiet,  
		okay. Shhh...
 
       And he slowly and softly shuts the door.    
		        
		Now Lombard switches the TV off, puts his briefcase on the bed,   
		       picks up the intercom and, with  
		it wedged between his shoulder and   
		       ear, pulls his handgun and a silencer from his pocket and  
		calmly   
		       starts screwing one onto the other.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thereís no toilet paper.  
		                    
		(pause)  
		                 Thereís no toilet paper.  
		                    
		(pause again)  
		                 Uh-huh. Iím sure. And  
		hurry, will you.
 
                                                             
		CUT TO:
 
       Lombard stands behind the open padded door, gun at the ready, a   
		        
		cigarette between his lips, listening... The outer door is being   
		       unlocked... slams shut... footsteps...  
		The giant steps in with a   
		       pack of toilet rolls: ĎHereís the...í  
		        
		Lombard sticks the gun into the nape of his neck and kicks the   
		       door shut.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 On the bed!
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                   (bemused, turning)  
		                  
		What...?
 
       Lombard whacks him across the face with the gun, shoves him   
		        
		hard... The giant drops the toilet rolls, stumbles back onto the   
		       edge of the bed... He puts his  
		hands to his face, takes them away -   
		       theyíre red with blood from his nose.
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Jesus...
 
        
		He starts to rise, furious, reaching under his jacket...  Lombard   
		       sends him back down with  
		another crack across the face...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Where is the Austrian?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 You... Fuck you! 
 
        
		Lombard aims at one of the giantís knees, SHOOTS...  THE GIANTíS   
		       LEG JERKS, FALLS STILL...  
		The giant gapes at his knee.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Youíre not playing with little  
		boys now,   
		                 scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Jee... Fuck... Youíre fucking  
		mad!
 
       Lombard SHOOTS HIS OTHER KNEE... Stunned - though still showing no   
		        
		pain - the giant gapes at the blood cascading onto his polished   
		       shoes... looks up:
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Who are you?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (aiming the gun  
		at the giantís crotch)  
		                 Where is the  
		Austrian? Is Friedman the   
		                 Austrian?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                   (grabbing his crotch)  
		                  
		Yes. Friedmanís the fuckiní Austrian!
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Where is he?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 I donít know. Heís gone!   
		                    
		(Lombard slaps him)  
		                 Heís gone. I donít  
		fucking know where, I   
		                 swear... Heís  
		gone. On holiday...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 ...On holiday?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Yeah... This morning. He left  
		this fucking   
		                 bloody morning... Jesus,  
		man, my knees...
 
       And the giant begins to sob with his trembling hands suspended in   
		        
		mid-air above his knees...  Lombard watches him, thoughtful, then: 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Whoís the money man?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Who?  
		                    
		(Lombard aims at his crotch again)  
		                  
		Martin... Heís Martin... 
 
       Lombard pulls out the SNAPSHOT OF LEON - with Rhian torn off,  
		only   
		       her arm around Leonís waist visible.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Ever seen him before?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                   (he peers at the  
		snapshot)  
		                 No... No...  
		                    
		(off Lombardís look: ĎAre you sure?í)  
		                  
		I swear...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Whatís this place? A hotel  
		of some kind?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Yeah... The Diplomat. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Where?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 What?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Where are we? 
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Finsbury Park. Weíre in Finsbury  
		Park.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Where are the kids?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 What kids?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 There were six on offer, you  
		scumbag.   
		                 Where are the other five?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 I donít know...   
		                    
		(Lombard whacks him across the face)  
		                  
		This is just a delivery place, man! I   
		                  
		swear I donít know where the kids are... I   
		                  
		work for Martin, thatís all. Martin knows.   
		                  
		He works for Friedman. He knows... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 And who does Friedman work  
		for?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 The company. We all work for  
		the company.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What company?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 I donít know. I donít know,  
		man. I donít   
		                 even know Friedman that  
		well... I...  
		                   (he stares  
		at his bloody knees again)  
		                 Man, youíve  
		got to get me out of here...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 How many of you scumbags are  
		here?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Just me...  
		                    
		(off Lombardís look)  
		                 Martinís gone  
		back to the Ambassador.   
		                 Look...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Whatís the Ambassador?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Another hotel. Down the road.  
		Martin lives   
		                 there. He took your  
		money. Heís got a   
		                 safe...    
		                    
		(staring at his bleeing knees again)  
		                  
		I need a doctor... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What about the staff?  
		                    
		(off the giantís look:íWhat about   
		                     
		them?í)  
		                 Theyíre in on whatís going  
		on, arenít   
		                 they?  How many of  
		them?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 F-five. The Wilsons and their  
		three kids.   
		                 They run the place. Look,  
		man, Iíve got to   
		                 get to...
 
        
		Lombard knocks him out with a gun blow to the back of the head... 
 

       INT. CORRIDOR. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		ROOM 40... Gun at the ready, Lombard knocks at the door... No   
		       answer.  He tries the handle;  
		itís locked...  He frowns, thinks,   
		       turns towards...
 

        
		INT. SEQUENCE. STAIRWELL/CORRIDORS. AFTERNOON. 
 
       Stairwell. Lombard hurries down the stairs,  
		hand gripping his gun,   
		       reaches...  
		       A SIGN: ĎSECOND FLOORí...   
		DULL SOUND OF TELEVISION from behind a   
		       door.  Lombard goes on down the stairs... ĎFIRST  
		FLOORí... VOICES   
		       drift up from the lobby... Lombard listens... The voice of a YOUNG   
		        
		GIRL is drowned by a loud DRUNK IRISH MAN...: ĎBecause Iím telling   
		       you, woman. Iíll be home next  
		Sunday...í  Lombard turns, looks   
		       back along...  
		       The corridor:  
		at the end, A WINDOW shows cold twilight... He makes   
		       for it...  
		        
		THROUGH THE WINDOW: in heavy rain, cars crawl in their headlights   
		       along the dark expanse of FINSBURY  
		PARK...
 

       INT. ROOM 46. AFTERNOON.
 
       Lombard squats  
		over the groaning giant (now tied to a radiator, A   
		       POOL OF BLOOD around his legs), searching  
		him...  He tosses the   
		       giantís gun away, disregards his wallet, mobile phone... finds THE  
		       ROOM KEY - pockets it - and KEYS ON A BMW KEYRING. He examines   
		        
		them... pockets them... stands, kicks the giant...  
		       The giant groans... opens dazed eyes to see...  
		LOMBARDíS SHOES   
		       STANDING ON THE BLOOD SOAKED CARPET...  
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What colour is your car?  
		                    
		(off the giantís dazed look: ĎHuh?í)  
		                  
		What colour is your car?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 B-Black...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Where is it?
 
                                    
		GIANT  
		                 Downstairs... At the front...  
		Jesus...
 
       The giant looks up, hopefully... Lombard knocks him out again with   
		        
		the gun...  
		         
		       THE BATHROOM: boy #6 still sits with his untouched  
		chocolate   
		       bar...
 

       INT. CORRIDORS/STAIRWELLS/LOBBY. THE  
		DIPLOMAT.
 
       IN ON LOMBARDíS BLOODY SHOE stepping onto the corridor carpet...   
		        
		STAIRWELL: Lombard, his gun in one hand - concealed beneath the   
		       raincoat over his arm - his briefcase  
		and the boyís arm in the   
		       other hand, hurries down the stairs towards the SOUND OF MUFFLED   
		        
		VOICES from below...  
		       He tugs the boy past the ĎSECOND FLOORí sign and on down the   
		        
		stairs...  
		       SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING and LAUGHTER below... Lombard stops,   
		        
		tightens his grip on the gun, peers over the bannister...   
		       FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR: AN EMBRACING  
		YOUNG COUPLE steps into the   
		       stairwell and starts slowly down, exchanging kisses and   
		        
		pleasantries...  
		       Lombard frowns, glances at the boy, decides to... He picks up the   
		        
		boy, sits him on his arm, and hurries down after...  
		       The couple... Lombard slows, follows close  
		behind them as they   
		       near the lights and noise of the lobby, eyeing over their heads...  
		        
		       AN ORDINARY 2 STAR HOTEL LOBBY.  A DRUNK leans against the wall   
		        
		with a bag at his feet...  Beyond, at THE DESK, by a flickering   
		       TV, a PRETTY RECEPTIONIST  
		is giving directions to TWO MEN bent   
		       over an ĎA to Zí.  Further, a WOMAN shakes her wet  
		umbrella by the   
		       glass front door...  
		       The couple skirt the  
		drunk... Lombard follows, speeding up... He   
		       catches up with the couple as... The man puts his  
		room key onto   
		       the desk without stopping... As the receptionist looks up and   
		        
		smiles mechanically,  Lombard hurries ahead... past the couple...   
		       past the umbrella girl  
		and...
 

       EXT. THE DIPLOMAT/STREETS, FINSBURY PARK. DUSK.  
		        
		...Out, into POURING RAIN.  Hugging the boy to him, Lombard turns   
		       right outside the door  
		and hurries away... He looks back over his   
		       shoulder just once before... He turns the corner...  
		Crosses the   
		       road... Strides past shops... Turns another corner... stops and,   
		        
		pocketing his gun, searches the street... Sees...
 

       EXT. BUS SHELTER. DUSK.  
		        
		TWO WOMEN wait for a bus... IN ON WOMAN #1: an instinctive smile   
		       as... IN ON WOMAN #2: a frown  
		as... Lombard steps into the shelter   
		       still hugging the boy... He returns woman #1ís smile, puts  
		the boy   
		       down, scrutinizes him...  
		       The boy stands in his plimsolls,  
		wet and shivering, clasping his   
		       sodden chocolate bar to his chest, staring at the ground...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Quíest-ce que je vais faire  
		de toi, hein?
 
       He turns to... Woman #1ís smile has gone; she stares at the boy   
		        
		with a worried scowl... Feeling Lombardís gaze, she looks up...   
		       Lombard grins, contritely:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I just found him standing  
		all alone in the   
		                 rain. Iíd be grateful  
		if one of you would   
		                 be kind enough  
		to take him to the local   
		                 police station.  
		His parents are probably   
		                 looking  
		for him.  
		                 Sorry. Iím in a hurry. Thank  
		you.
 
       And he hastens away into the rain... The two women frown at each   
		        
		other...
 

       EXT. ROAD ALONG FINSBURY PARK. DUSK.
 
        
		Dripping wet, smoking, Lombard stands with his back to the park...  
		       Facing him across the street:  
		NONDESCRIPT HOTELS - one lit up neon   
		       sign reads ĎTHE DIPLOMATí; another, 50 yards away: ĎTHE  
		       AMBASSADORí.  Lombard flicks his cigarette away towards...   
		        
		A SHINY BLACK BMW parked along the kerb... 
 

       INT. LOBBY. THE AMBASSADOR. DUSK.
 
        
		Similar to the Diplomat. A harassed-looking MALE RECEPTIONIST   
		       argues over a bill with a SCOTTISH  
		FAMILY checking out...  
		         
		       Dripping onto the carpet, Lombard  
		peers past the receptionist   
		       into...  
		       AN OPEN DOORWAY behind  
		the desk: TWO FILIPINO-LOOKING WOMEN   
		       (raincoats, handbags) sit silently at a table over tea mugs.  
		A   
		       BALD MAN (English, shirtsleeves) reads a tabloid in an armchair   
		        
		beyond them... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (curtly, interrupting  
		the   
		                    receptionist)  
		                  
		Hello there. Martin around?
 
       The receptionist frowns, looks Lombard quickly up and down,  
		       glances at his briefcase, hesitates, then, off Lombardís stony   
		        
		grin:
 
                              
		MALE RECEPTIONIST  
		                 Er, Mr Martinís  
		gone to the dentist. He   
		                 should be  
		back soon.   
		                   (pointing  
		to an armchair by a potted   
		                     
		plant)  
		                 If you want to wait...
 
        
		Lombard turns to... 
 
       The entrance; TWO MEN (one middle-aged,coat, scarf; the other   
		        
		young, long-hair, leather jacket) walk in, wave at the   
		       receptionist, cross behind Lombard and  
		the family and go through   
		       another door past the desk... to reappear in the room with the   
		        
		Filipino women and the bald man who, seeing them, stands up to   
		       close the open door, absent-mindedly  
		peering at Lombard as he does   
		       so...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thank you. Iíll come back  
		later.
 
       The receptionist nods and turns back to the family with a sigh...
 

        
		EXT. THE AMBASSADOR/FINSBURY PARK. DUSK.
 
       RAIN. A few yards from the Ambassador, Lombard  
		shelters in a dark   
		       doorway, eyes searching the pavements left and right and across   
		        
		the traffic packed road... He focuses on the BURLY SILHOUETTE of a   
		       coated man with an umbrella  
		heading his way... Itís not Martin...   
		       Turns to A VOLVO parking nearby... A woman and two children  
		get   
		       out... Turns as A TAXI stops across the road...   
		       MARTIN  
		- coat, gloves, scarf - gets out and starts to cross   
		       between cars...
 
        
		Lombard blocks Martinís way as he steps onto the kerb...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 How are you, Martin?
 
        
		IN ON Martin as he stops dead with a tight-lipped frown; his LEFT   
		       CHEEK IS SWOLLEN, it takes  
		him a moment to recognise Lombard... He   
		       glowers, instinctively lowers his eyes to... the pocket  
		in which   
		       Lombard conspicuously holds a gun... peers at his briefcase...   
		        
		Then, WITH A SLIGHT SLUR:
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Problems?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (nodding back  
		at the Ambassador)  
		                 Is my money in  
		there?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                   (a beat, a bit  
		reassured, foxy eyes   
		                     
		smiling)  
		                 Uh-huh. You couldíve waited  
		for me inside.
 
       Lombard nods, gently... grins an icy grin... signals towards the   
		        
		Diplomat...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Letís go.
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                   (not moving, still  
		smiling)  
		                 I donít know what your problem  
		is, but...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Right now your big friend  
		at the Diplomat   
		                 is bleeding fast,  
		Martin. He might still   
		                 possibly survive  
		if attended to soon. And   
		                 he did cooperate.
 
        
		IN ON Martin; incredulity and fear... He automatically glances at   
		       the Ambassadorís lit up entrance  
		behind Lombard... Then... a   
		       frustrated grin...
 

       EXT.  
		BLACK BMW NEAR DIPLOMAT, FINSBURY PARK. DUSK.
 
       Lombard shoves Martin into the BMW driverís  
		seat, slams the door   
		       shut and...
 

       INT. STATIONARY BMW,  
		FINSBURY PARK. DUSK.
 
       Martin, pissed-off, watches Lombard settle behind him in the   
		        
		rearview mirror...
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 If itís money you want youíre  
		making a   
		                 mistake.
 
        
		Ignoring him, Lombard opens his coat, pulls the snapshot from his   
		       jacket pocket, holds it out  
		over Martinís shoulder...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Ever seen him before?
 
        
		Martin squints in the semi-dark, turns, signals Lombard that heís   
		       going for his inside pocket...  
		slowly takes out spectacles, puts   
		       them on...
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Am I supposed to know him?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Six weeks ago. He bought a  
		boy of yours.
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Clients come and go.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 This one came back and was  
		never seen   
		                 again. I understand Friedman  
		looked after   
		                 him.
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                   (squinting at the  
		snapshot, sceptical)  
		                 Huh, I doubt  
		it...   
		                   (he trails off,  
		takes his glasses   
		                     
		off...)  
		                 Friedman only deals directly  
		with select   
		                 customers. I handle the  
		rabble...
 
       IN ON Lombard; a frown... He pockets the snapshot...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Where is Friedman?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                   (eyeing Lombard  
		in the rearview   
		                     
		mirror)  
		                 Look, I donít think youíre  
		fully aware of   
		                 what youíre playing  
		with here, Mister.   
		                 Whoever put you  
		up to this either pays too   
		                 well or  
		misinformed you. Why donít you   
		                 just  
		tell me what it is you want so we can   
		                  
		do business in a civilized manner, eh?
 
       IN ON Lombard; his eyes darken... In one swift movement  
		he whacks   
		       Martinís swollen cheek.  Martin screams in pain... Lombard watches   
		        
		calmly as he buries his cheek in his hands, moaning... Then:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 If I were you Iíd stop acting  
		dumb and   
		                 narrow down my thoughts  
		to speculating on   
		                 whether Iím going  
		to kill you even if you   
		                 do answer  
		my questions, Martin. Now, where   
		                  
		is Friedman?  
		                   (he waits  
		for Martinís moans to   
		                     
		subside)  
		                 Where is Friedman, Martin?
 
        
		As Martin glares ahead without answering, Lombard sticks the gun   
		       into the nape of his neck...  
		ďWhere is...Ē
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Alright. Alright...   
		                    
		(nervous, he peers in the rearview   
		                     
		mirror)  
		                 Youíre not gonna like it...  
		Right now   
		                 Friedman must be landing  
		in Los Angeles.   
		                 Not due back for  
		a month.
 
       IN ON Lombard; a flicker of dismay.  Martin sees it... Sneers...
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Whatíll you do now, eh? Fly  
		to the U.S. or   
		                 make an appointment  
		for next month?
 
       Lombard thinks, staring at the gun still stuck in Martinís neck...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Friedman lives with you at  
		the Ambassador? 
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 No. In Hampstead... Why? 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (holding out the  
		BMW keys)  
		                 Donít jump any red lights.
 

        
		EXT/INT. HAVERSTOCK HILL/BMW. DUSK.
 
       Rain and heavy traffic.  The BMW climbs towards  
		Hampstead...   
		       JOLTS...
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 This car needs petrol.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (whacking him  
		across the back of the   
		                     
		head)  
		                 Shut up and drive!
 
        
		The car coughs, jolts... Runs smoothly again as Martin turns into   
		       a level road...
 

        
		EXT. HAMPSTEAD RESIDENTIAL ROADS. EVENING.
 
       The BMW cruises past a few opulent houses...  
		        
		Through the rear WINDOW: IN ON Lombard peering at...  
		       A STREET SIGN: ĎReddington Road, NW6í...   
		Lombard looks back at it   
		       over his shoulder as the BMW continues on and disappears around a   
		        
		corner... 
 

       INT. STATIONARY BMW. EVENING
 
       The car  
		is idling.  Martin peers across the road...  
		       Lombard eyes... A quaint HAMPSTEAD COTTAGE (ALARM  
		SIREN BOX   
		       conspicuous on facade); the diamond-paned windows are dark, a car   
		        
		under a tarpaulin sits in the drive, A SIDE GATE visible in the   
		       darkness behind it...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 So this is Friedmanís... How  
		many kids is   
		                 that worth, eh?  
		                    
		(a beat)  
		                 Pull across and park in front  
		of the   
		                 drive.
 

        
		EXT. ROAD BY DRIVEWAY, FRIEDMANíS COTTAGE. EVENING. 
 
       Rain hammers onto the gun and  
		silencer in Lombardís hands...   
		       Through the BMWís open rear window, Lombard takes aim... pulls  
		the   
		       trigger: four flashes in quick succession... PHEWT, PHEWT, PHEWT,   
		        
		PHEWT...  
		         
		       IN ON THE ALARM BOX; THUD, THUD, THUD, THUD....  
		Four holes, smoke,   
		       sparks... The LOW WHINE of a starting siren... It dies. SILENCE.
 

        
		INT. BMW. EVENING
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Youíre out of your mind. Whatís  
		the idea?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (peering out at  
		the nearest house; no   
		                     
		sign of life)  
		                 Maybe the thought of  
		people like you going   
		                 on holiday  
		bothers me. Come on, letís   
		                 go...
 

        
		EXT. FRONT DRIVE, FRIEDMANíS COTTAGE. EVENING.
 
       Lombard pushes Martin up the wall by the  
		side gate...
 

       EXT. BACK GARDEN, FRIEDMANíS COTTAGE. EVENING.
 
        
		CRASH... LOMBARDíS FIST (wrapped in his coat) punches out a pane   
		       of the FRENCH WINDOWS...   
		Dripping wet, Martin watches sternly...  
		       Now Lombard has the door open, gestures Martin inside...
 

        
		INT. FRIEDMANíS DRAWING ROOM. EVENING.
 
       SILENCE, DARKNESS.  Lombard waits just inside,  
		watching... Martin   
		       moves through the dark, stops, reaches for... CLICK; a chandelier   
		        
		lights up...  
		       Lombard scans the room... Regency furniture, oil paintings, bronze   
		        
		statuettes...  He frowns at... A PICASSO NUDE... then turns to...    
		       Martin, hands in  
		pockets, gazes grimly at the muddy footprints   
		       heís left across the carpet... Lombard nods towards  
		the Picasso...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Is it real?  
		                    
		(Martin sneers)  
		                 You people are sick.
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Huh. Iíd have thought a tough  
		guy like you   
		                 would know better. The  
		sick ones are out   
		                 there, friend.  
		They make up the clientŤle.   
		                 Get rid  
		of them and weíre out of business.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Only feeding the disease,  
		eh, Martin?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Money talks, bullshit walks,  
		whether you   
		                 like it or not.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Maybe I donít.
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Maybe you should. Think about  
		it. Those   
		                 who can afford our goods  
		do their thing   
		                 without upsetting  
		anyone. Those who canít   
		                 do it to  
		kids from the streets or their   
		                 own  
		family and it makes upsetting   
		                 headlines.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím overcome by your public-spiritedness.
 
                                   
		MARTIN   
		                 Boys like the one you met  
		today are   
		                 surplus. Commodities worth  
		a handful of   
		                 notes in whatever arsehole  
		of the world   
		                 they happen to be born  
		into. We improve   
		                 some lives buying  
		them where theyíre not   
		                 wanted, improve  
		still more selling them   
		                 where they  
		are. Is that too hard for you?
 
       IN ON Lombard; loathing burns in his eyes.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You know what, Martin? I ought  
		to tie you   
		                 down with your old arse  
		up in the air and   
		                 advertise the hole  
		in the middle of it to   
		                 the world.  
		Free. And hope you never die.
 
                                   
		MARTIN   
		                 Huh... Iím sure thereíd be  
		lots of takers.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Could someone have hurt you  
		that bad?
 
       They eyeball each other... Lombard waves his gun towards a door...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Come on. Letís find somewhere  
		to keep you   
		                 out of sight.
 

        
		INT. KITCHEN, FRIEDMANíS COTTAGE. EVENING.
 
       Lombard shoves Martin through a door into...   
		A WINDOWLESS LAUNDRY   
		       ROOM; Martin crashes into a washing machine... Lombard slams the   
		        
		door...
 

       INT. FRIEDMANíS COTTAGE. EVENING.
 
       UPSTAIRS  
		CORRIDOR: walking, gun in hand, Lombard opens doors,   
		       switches on lights, glances into... 
 
       A BEDROOM: Double bed, impersonal, obviously a spare bedroom...  
 
        
		A BATHROOM: carpeted, antique bathtub, gold taps...
 
       A LAVATORY: Wooden toilet lid, gold  
		toilet roll holder...
 
       THE MASTER BEDROOM: Spacious, oil landscapes, bay window...   
		       Lombard steps in, frowning at... The single bed with silk spread;   
		        
		A MANíS LEATHER SLIPPERS on the carpet, square to the bed...  
		       He peers into the closet... Menís  
		clothes and shoes, neatly   
		       arranged and hung...  
		       The bedside  
		cabinet.  He pulls open the drawer... A handkerchief,   
		       neatly folded, a leather bound book...  
		He picks it up... A BIBLE,   
		       IN GERMAN... 
 

       INT. OFFICE,  
		FRIEDMANíS COTTAGE. EVENING.  
		       Lombard sits in a swivel chair at a leather-topped desk, its   
		        
		drawers pulled open.  Lighting a Gitane he solemnly surveys...  
		         
		        
		THE DESK: a mat, lamp, pen-set, three telephones in line and his   
		       gun, next to a pile of papers...  
		IN ON the top sheet: a gas bill   
		       made out to OTTO GLUCK.  
		       Lombard  
		sighs, scans the room... panelled walls, leather bound   
		       books and...  
		        
		Opposite the desk; AN OIL PORTRAIT OF A MAN, about 40, dark and   
		       handsome, sitting legs crossed  
		before a fireplace...  Lombard   
		       focuses on it... frowns... sticks his cigarette between his  
		lips   
		       and makes for it...  
		         
		        
		IN ON the painting: beyond the man, hung above the fireplace, a   
		       SKETCH OF THE PICASSO NUDE FROM  
		FRIEDMANíS DRAWING ROOM...   
		       Lombard peers at the painterís signature... illegible... The manís  
		       eyes... intense and dark... He unhooks the painting, turns it   
		        
		over...  
		         
		       In small letters on the canvas we read: ďO.G.   
		WIEN, 1979Ē.  
 

       INT. KITCHEN. EVENING.
 
       With  
		the painting and gun in one hand, Gitane in his mouth,   
		       Lombard unlocks the laundry room door,  
		pushes it open, frowns and   
		       freezes, looking into...  
		         
		        
		DARKNESS... A SCREAM.  Lombard starts, sees... MARTIN COMING AT   
		       HIM, face contorted in a  
		scream...  Lombard bites on his Gitane,   
		       drops the painting, drops to a squat, aims and...  
		FIRES!  Martin   
		       crashes hard into his shoulders, stumbles over him and Lombard   
		        
		springs up, sending him tumbling into the kitchen where...   
		       Martinís body hits the floor with  
		a loud thud.  Lombard spins   
		       round, trains his gun on him.  Face up, Martin lies still...  
		       ĎDamn...í  
		         
		       SILENCE. Lombard  
		waits... moves to Martin... inspects his chest:   
		       BLOOD GURGLES through his shirt... Martinís face;  
		a grin... In a   
		       throaty voice:
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Thought I might as well have  
		a go. You   
		                 were going to bump me off  
		anyway, werenít   
		                 you?
 
        
		Lombard stays silent, flicks his cigarette into the sink, looks   
		       around, picks up the painting  
		and holds it above Martin.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Is this Friedman?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Who are you? Who are you working  
		for, huh?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Is this Friedman, Martin?  
		                    
		(Martin glances at the painting,   
		                     
		snarls)  
		                 Come on, scumbag. Youíve reached  
		your sell-   
		                 by date. Tell me if this  
		is Friedman,   
		                 where he is in Los Angeles  
		and what name   
		                 heís using?
 
                                   
		MARTIN   
		                 Youíre making a mistake, tough  
		guy.   
		                 Whoever he is, your guyís not  
		one of   
		                 Friedmanís...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You seem very sure about that.
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 I told you... The rabble, itís  
		me...  
		                   (a beat; he looks  
		away... distant)  
		                 Huh... Itís sad.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What is?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Dying without ever reaching  
		the top...
 
       And he goes off into rasping laughter...  Lombard stares, A   
		        
		CRAZED, CRUEL GRIN on his face...  He drops the painting, gets   
		       hold of Martin, drags him  
		to the wall, sits him up and rips his   
		       bloody shirt open as Martin dazedly protests.  
		        
		Lombard eyes his bleeding chest, looks back into his eyes... IN ON   
		       LOMBARDíS FIST, THROWING A  
		PUNCH AT THE WOUND...IN ON Lombard;   
		       BLOOD SPLATTERS his face...IN ON Martin; eyes wide, mouth  
		open in   
		       a harrowing yell...  
		       IN ON Lombard; a grin as he stares  
		at Martin...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Feel the invigorating tonic  
		of pain,   
		                 Martin? Itís amazing how  
		long a dying man   
		                 can be kept alive.  
		Sometimes itís just a   
		                 matter of keeping  
		his adrenalin flowing.   
		                 Iím going  
		to keep yours swirling until you   
		                  
		wish youíd never turned bad.
 
       He throws another punch at the wound - more blood splatters  
		       Lombard, Martin becomes mute with pain - then stands, turns, opens   
		        
		kitchen drawers; another, and another, until he finds... A BONING   
		       KNIFE...  He turns back...  
		        
		IN ON Martin: dread... He tries to speak, can only gasp and   
		       stutter. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Trying to say something, Martin?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Hyatt... Friedmanís... at the  
		Hyatt...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The Hyatt...? Whatís that?
 
                                   
		MARTIN  
		                 Ho-hotel... Los Angeles...  
		He...
 
       THE SOUND OF FAST APPROACHING POLICE SIRENS... Lombard turns,   
		        
		frowns... turns back to Martin, hesitates... picks up his gun and   
		       hurries to...
 

        
		INT. OFFICE, FRIEDMANíS COTTAGE. EVENING.
 
       Lombard switches off the light, hurries to the  
		window...  
		       BEYOND THE FRONT DRIVE: all is peace in the road as the police   
		        
		siren nears and...  A POLICE CAR SPEEDS PAST THE BMW AND AWAY... 
 

       INT. KITCHEN. EVENING.
 
        
		IN ON Lombard: a thwarted frown as he lights a Gitane eyeing...   
		       Martin, eyes and mouth open,  
		still hugging his chest... DEAD.  
		       Lombard turns to the wall-mounted phone by the fridge, picks  
		it   
		       up, starts dialling, changes his mind... 
 

       EXT/INT.  
		BMW/STREET, FRIEDMANíS COTTAGE. EVENING.
 
       EXT. HOWLING WIND AND RAIN, A STARTER MOTOR TURNING  
		OVER..   
		       Lombard, in the BMW, trying and trying to start the engine...  
		        
		INT. Lombard gives up, scowls at... IN ON the GLOWING FUEL WARNING   
		       LIGHT on the dash...   
		He inspect his blood spattered coat, peers   
		       through the pouring rain to Friedmanís cottage...  
		turns to... In   
		       the wet distance, the halo of a phone box... He swallows without   
		        
		parting his lips and...  
		       EXT. Through the deluge, Lombard strides away from Friedmanís   
		        
		cottage...
 
                               
		LOMBARD (V.O.)  
		                 Itís me. Be at my office  
		in one hour.
 

       EXT. ESSEX ROAD. EVENING
 
       RAIN. Deborahís  
		Aston Martin pulls up in front of the butcher   
		       shop...
 

        
		INT. BATHROOM, LOMBARDíS FLAT. EVENING.
 
       THE HISS OF A SHOWER. THROUGH STEAM: Lombardís wet  
		coat and   
		       clothes in a heap on the floor... THE DOORBELL RINGS.
 

        
		INT. LOMBARDíS OFFICE. EVENING.
 
       Naked, drying his hair with a towel, Lombard buzzes the  
		street   
		       door open, opens his door and makes for his desk, wrapping the   
		        
		towel around his waist...  
		       Heís lighting a Gitane when...  Deborah - radiant, low cut evening  
		       dress, fur coat - stops in the door... She looks him over,   
		        
		coldly... examines the room...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thank you for coming. Come  
		in and close   
		                 the door, will you?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (without moving  
		from the doorway)  
		                 Last night you upset  
		my sleep. Tonight my   
		                 social life.  
		We have two minutes. My   
		                 dinner guests  
		are waiting.
 
       Lombard looks her over, sullen... He opens his briefcase, swivels   
		        
		it towards her and sits down, saying:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 It may not look as good as  
		yours but I   
		                 guess you wonít mind.  
		The envelope   
		                 contains what I know.  
		Plus the location of   
		                 your brotherís  
		boy.
 
       Deborah frowns... Glances at...   
		       In the briefcase:  
		the bundles of USED NOTES from Lombardís safety   
		       deposit box and the envelope heíd left with Jane  
		earlier (torn   
		       open)...  
		         
		        
		IN ON Deborah; disquiet in her eyes... She quickly composes   
		       herself again...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 You lost my money?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You could say that. And Friedman  
		left this   
		                 morning for Los Angeles.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Who is Friedman?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The man who sold the boy to  
		your brother.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Iím impressed. That information  
		could have   
		                 cost me £20,000.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Well, I found a little more  
		than that. Let   
		                 me put it this way:...  
		                    
		(deliberately using her earlier   
		                     
		syntax)  
		                 Last night I thought your  
		brother might be   
		                 dead, tonight Iím  
		convinced he is. That   
		                 said, I have  
		no evidence and I advise you   
		                 to let  
		the police deal with it. 
 
       Deborah peers at him... runs her eyes over his bare chest...   
		        
		focuses on... HIS SHOULDER, BADLY BRUISED (from Martinís   
		       attack)...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Iím beginning to think you  
		want my brother   
		                 dead, Mr Lombard.  
		What happened? Did   
		                 someone frightened  
		you?  
		                   (a beat, looking  
		up into his eyes   
		                     
		again)  
		                 Or is the job too formidable  
		for you?
 
       IN ON Lombard; irritation... Deborah sneers... glances at her   
		        
		watch...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 No police, Mr Lombard. You  
		talk of strange   
		                 and unpleasant things.  
		You found a   
		                 loathsome tape. Perhaps  
		even a poor little   
		                 boy. But as yet,  
		youíve not found my   
		                 brother. When  
		you have, weíll ascertain   
		                 whether  
		or not to contact the police and   
		                  
		break my parentsí hearts with the news   
		                  
		that their son is involved with...   
		                  
		pornographers.  
		                   (a beat)  
		                  
		Your Mr Friedman could shed some light on   
		                  
		the matter, you say. Well, find him.   
		                  
		Didnít I hear you say he was in Los   
		                  
		Angeles?
 
       SILENCE. They outstare each other for a moment... Lombard runs his   
		        
		eyes over her rings, earrings, bracelets... (sheís wearing her   
		       wealth tonight)
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Are we understood?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You watched the tape?  
		                    
		(off her look; ĎMaybe I did.í)  
		                 Friedman  
		and his people donít just provide   
		                  
		little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes.   
		                  
		Theyíre in the import-export business.   
		                  
		They run hotels here in London which they   
		                  
		probably use as ware- houses and ports of   
		                  
		call for their merchandise.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (after a beat,  
		uneasy, then   
		                    dismissive)  
		                  
		Huh! Really? Hotels?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The hotels are useful capital  
		investments.   
		                 The kids liquid assets.  
		My guess is they   
		                 own hotels across  
		the globe, and travel   
		                 agencies specialising  
		in flights from the   
		                 third world to  
		boot.
 
       Deborah gets the picture, but sheís sceptical, and baffled...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Minimizes the risks. Children  
		can be moved   
		                 across borders using  
		reliable businesses.   
		                 These can also  
		be used to move women and   
		                 drugs...  
		Anything that makes money really.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (after a beat,  
		still sceptical)  
		                 W-why are you telling  
		me all this, Mr   
		                 Lombard?
 
        
		Lombard looks at her for a moment... sighs...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 This has become dangerous.  
		Iíll have to   
		                 double my fee.
 
        
		Deborah peers at him... GLANCES AT THE MONEY IN THE BRIEFCASE,   
		       then up at Lombard again, focusing  
		again on his bruised   
		       shoulder...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 You drive a hard bargain,  
		Mr Lombard.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You do want me to keep the  
		job, donít you,   
		                 Mrs De Moraes? 
 
        
		She sends him a rueful smile... thinks... turns AND WALKS AWAY...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Let me know where youíre staying  
		when you   
		                 get to L.A. Just in case  
		Leon does turn   
		                 up.
 
        
		Stony-faced, Lombard eyes the door she has left open behind her,   
		       listening to her footsteps as  
		she starts down the stairs... HE   
		       CALLS:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 By the way, did I mention  
		that Mr Friedman   
		                 lives just around  
		the corner from you?
 
       DEBORAHíS STEPS STOP... quickly start again... Lombard grins, a   
		        
		cruel grin... reaches for the envelope from the briefcase, snaps   
		       the briefcase shut, pulls open  
		his desk drawer, shoves the   
		       envelope inside and shuts it: Slam!
 

        
		INT. BEDROOM, LOMBARDíS FLAT. MORNING.
 
       IN ON Jane; a sulky pout... Dressed for work, she  
		stands in the   
		       bedroom doorway fingering her handbag, watching Lombard pack a   
		        
		small case (a spare suit, a few essentials)...  Lombard makes for   
		       the bathroom...
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Why wonít you tell me where youíre  
		going?
 
       No reply.  She gazes around the room: forbidden territory...  
		        
		Lombard comes back in, zipping up a sponge bag with a weary   
		       smile...
 
                                
		LOMBARD (OS)  
		                 When Iím back. If you  
		look after my fish   
		                 well.
 
        
		She guffaws, nervously, then - sheís obviously been dying to ask   
		       this:
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Who was that woman? Sheís French,  
		isnít   
		                 she?
 
        
		Lombard frowns, shuts the case, takes a key from his bedside   
		       table.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 She used to be my girlfriend,  
		Jane.  
		                   (he throws her the  
		key)  
		                 Here. Youíll be late for work.  
		And you can   
		                 pick up my accounts from  
		the desk. Theyíre   
		                 signed.
 
        
		She catches the key, slightly stunned...then smiles...
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Sheís pretty... See you, huh?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Bye bye, Jane. And donít be  
		naughty.
 
       She nods - ĎYeah, yeah...í - waves a hand, turns away...
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Actually, Iím thinking of becoming  
		a   
		                 lesbian...
 

        
		INT. LOMBARDíS KITCHEN. MORNING.
 
       Rain outside the window... Lombard sits at the table, the  
		phone   
		       held in the crook of his neck... On the table: a MICROWAVE OVEN,   
		        
		its back panel removed, a screwdriver, his gun, silencer and the   
		       money from his briefcase...  
		        
		As he speaks on the phone he reaches into a large brown padded   
		       envelope, pulls out... TWO RED  
		EUROPEAN COMMUNITY PASSPORTS. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Hello. This is Mr Lombard  
		- I... 
 
                             
		WOMANíS VOICE (O.S.)  
		                 Ooh, yes. Rhian  
		said you might call. Sheís   
		                 fine.  
		I saw her this morning... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Good. Tell her I called, all  
		right.  
 
       Holding the passports, Lombard dials again, replaces the phone in   
		        
		the crook of his neck and, as the PHONE RINGS, inspects...  
		       The passports: ONE ITALIAN, ONE BRITISH...   
		He puts the British   
		       one down, replaces the other in the envelope, adding his gun,   
		        
		silencer and money...
 

       INT. SITTING ROOM, NATHALIEíS FLAT. MORNING.
 
        
		A RINGING PHONE. IN ON a vase: a bunch of flowers still in their   
		       wrapper... A tastefully furnished  
		room... An ANSWERPHONE   
		       responds...  
 
                         
		NATHALIEíS ANSWERING MACHINE  
		                 CLICK...  
		I am not here. Leave a message   
		                 after  
		the beep or try again later. Thank   
		                  
		you...
 

       INT. BEDROOM, NATHALIEíS FLAT. MORNING.
 
        
		IN PROFILE: Nathalie, on her bed wrapped in a duvet, her bedside   
		       table crowded with cold remedies,  
		the floor around her strewn with   
		       tissues.  She gazes at a silent flickering TV screen, a  
		cigarette   
		       between her fingers...
 
                                
		LOMBARD (OS)  
		                 Cíest moi. Rťponds si  
		tíes lŗ, Nathalie...
 
       IN ON Nathalie; she turns towards us, frowning, her nose red, eyes  
		       moist...
 
                                
		LOMBARD (OS)  
		                 Your friend... (he corrects  
		himself) ...   
		                 your man called with  
		what I needed but   
		                 things got a bit  
		messy. I think youíd be   
		                 wise to go  
		away for a while. They donít   
		                 know  
		who I am but they know you led me to   
		                  
		them... (long silence) ...Iíll be away a   
		                  
		few days. Look after yourself, okay.
 
       CLICK. Silence... Nathalie stares in front of her,  
		SNEERS...   
		       SNEEZES.
 

       EXT. ESSEX ROAD. MORNING.
 
        
		Standing in HEAVY RAIN holding his case, Lombard looks grim as he   
		       flags down a BLACK TAXI and  
		stands back as it pulls in.  
		       IN ON the taxi wheel sending up a splash from the streaming   
		        
		gutter...
 

       EXT. THE HYATT, SUNSET BOULEVARD, LOS ANGELES. DAY.
 
        
		LYNYRD SKYNYRD ON A CAR RADIO.  BRILLIANT BLUE SKY... A HUGE   
		       MARLBORO COWBOY erected on  
		a rooftop displays his virility to...  
		         
		       ĎTHE HYATTí, a chic  
		multi-storey hotel.  A YOUNG GUY (shirt,   
		       sneakers) comes out the entrance and, chewing gum,  
		grinning,   
		       passes TWO DOORMEN and A CHAUFFEUR fussing around a stretch limo   
		        
		in the FORECOURT...  
		       A GITANE HITS THE PAVEMENT WITH A SPRAY OF SPARKS.  
		        
		THE MUSIC CARRIES OVER...
 

       INT. STATIONARY TAXI CAB. DAY.
 
                                  
		YOUNG GUY  
		                   (settling at  
		the wheel)  
		                 They have a guest by the  
		name of Gluck but   
		                 no Friedman, sir.
 
        
		In the back, unshaven, Lombard squints tiredly in the bright   
		       light.
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 Did you get Mr Gluckís room  
		number?
 
                                  
		YOUNG GUY  
		                 Three three seven, sir.  
		                   (a beat)  
		                  
		You in the entertainment business?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No. And turn that radio down,  
		will you?
 
       And Lombard turns to the Hyatt, thinking... The cab driver pulls a   
		        
		face, turns away, shuts the radio and, glancing in his mirror   
		       while starting the engine, asks:
 
                                  
		YOUNG GUY  
		                 Right. Where to now, sir!
 
        
		Lombard thinks... turns, peers across the boulevard towards...  
		         
		        
		A multicoloured tower block: ĎTHE MONDRIAN HOTELí.
 

       INT. ROOM 504, MONDRIAN. DAY.
 
        
		A RINGING TONE. IN ON ďMondrian, Hotel De Grande ClasseĒ on the   
		       matchbook in Lombardís hand...  
		A Gitane in his mouth, showered, a   
		       towel around his waist, the phone under his chin, he gazes  
		out his   
		       5th floor window...  
		       SUNSET BOULEVARD snakes up and  
		away into the Hollywood hills...   
		       Across the boulevard, the Hyatt doormen chat in the shade of  
		the   
		       forecourt...
 
                             
		HYATT OPERATOR (OS)  
		                 Iím sorry but  
		Mr Gluck is not answering,   
		                 sir.   
		Would you like to leave a message?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iíll call again.
 
        
		Lombard hangs up, stays at the window, eyeing with a puzzled   
		       frown... THE EMPTY PAVEMENTS...  
		He raises his brows, redials...
 
                             
		HYATT OPERATOR (OS)  
		                 The Hyatt. Good  
		afternoon. May I help you?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (in a SLIGHT GERMAN  
		ACCENT)  
		                 Can I have the reception desk,  
		please.
 
       A click.  The ringing tone, then: ĎReception...í
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 This is Mr Gluck, room 337.  
		I am expecting   
		                 delivery of a parcel  
		at the hotel in the   
		                 next hour or  
		so. Could you see to it that   
		                 it is  
		taken to my room immediately.
 
                           
		HYATT RECEPTIONIST (OS)  
		                 Fine, Mr Gluck.  
		Room 337. No problem.
 

       INT. THE MONDRIAN BOUTIQUE. DAY.
 
        
		The LADY ASSISTANT gift-wraps A BOX OF CHOCOLATES while... Lombard   
		       tries on SUNGLASSES, looking  
		at himself in the display mirror...    
		       He selects a plain pair, takes them to the desk.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iíll have them too.
 
                             
		LADY SHOP ASSISTANT  
		                   (pushing  
		the box to him, sweet smile)  
		                 How will  
		you be paying, sir.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (pulling out his  
		wallet)  
		                 Cash. You wouldnít happen  
		to have a sticky   
		                 label and a pen.  
		I need to send the   
		                 chocolates somewhere.
 
        
		She sends him a knowing smile - a gift for a lady? - but then:
 
                               
		SHOP ASSISTANT  
		                 We have packs of ten  
		labels for two   
		                 dollars and pens...  
		                   (she breaks off, perhaps  
		encouraged by   
		                    Lombardís  
		enticing smile...)  
		                 Well, I guess I  
		could lend you a pen.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat, grinning)  
		                  
		Thatís very kind. I guess I better buy a   
		                  
		pack of labels then.
 

       INT. MONDRIAN RECEPTION DESK. DAY.
 
        
		Lombard hands the LABELLED PARCEL - we glimpse: ďMr O. GLUCK...Ē -   
		       to the RECEPTIONIST.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Would you please see this  
		is delivered to   
		                 the Hyatt in ten  
		minutes...
 

       EXT. MONDRIAN, SUNSET BOULEVARD. DAY.
 
        
		Lombard stands just outside the entrance.  He peers up at the sky,   
		       puts on his SUNGLASSES  
		as...  A GORGEOUS BLOND (starlet type, low-  
		       cut top, shades) in a convertible Porsche pulls  
		up in front of   
		       him... In a flash a PORTER holds her door open, beaming... ďHello,   
		        
		Miss JonesĒ...   
		       The Blond flashes her teeth, climbs out the car, proceeds to the   
		        
		entrance, past Lombard...  IN ON Lombard... IN ON the porter; both   
		       follow... CLIP CLOP...  
		every curve moving beneath her mini skirt   
		       and along her LONG LEGS ON STILETTOES... She slithers  
		through the   
		       door and out of sight...   
		         
		        
		The porter wiggles his brows at Lombard, hops into the Porsche,   
		       revs away...   
		        
		Lombard starts across Sunset Boulevard...
 

       INT. THE HYATT, LOBBY. DAY.
 
        
		Eyeing the HOTEL GUESTS around him, Lombard makes for the lifts...
 

       INT. 3RD FLOOR CORRIDOR,  
		HYATT. DAY.
 
       IN ON a door: ROOM 337...  The corridor is quiet, then...  
		        
		The LIFT DOORS slide open, a PORTER gets out holding Lombardís   
		       parcel and hurries along to...   
		       DOOR 337.  He knocks... No answer... He lets himself in with a   
		        
		key...   
		       Lombard steps out from behind a corner, makes for the door, goes   
		        
		on in and...
 

       INT.  ROOM 337, HYATT. DAY.
 
        
		...almost bumps into the porter hurrying back out.
 
                                   
		PORTER  
		                 Oh. Hi there. Mr Gluck...?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Uh-huh.
 
                                   
		PORTER  
		                   (signals towards  
		the parcel on the   
		                     
		table)  
		                 That packet just came for you,  
		sir. I was   
		                 told to bring it to your  
		room. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thatís right. Thank you...
 
        
		Lombard dips into his pocket, pulls out a $5 bill...
 
                                   
		PORTER  
		                 Thank you, sir. Have a nice  
		day...
 
       And he backs out, bowing, grinning, closing the door... And   
		        
		Lombard turns into the room...   
		         
		       No bags or personal belongings  
		to be seen...   
		       He peers through the BATHROOM DOOR; same...  Opens the wardrobe;   
		        
		empty but for... a HEATHROW DUTY FREE BAG and a SMALL LEATHER   
		       TRAVELLING BAG with a VIRGIN AIRWAYS  
		tag... He looks inside...  
		       In the duty free bag: a bottle of Armagnac...  In the travelling  
		       bag: LEATHER SLIPPERS, like those in Friedmanís London bedroom...   
		        
		       IN ON Lombard; he doesnít like it... He makes for the window...  
		        
		       Across Sunset, the ĎMondrianí... In the sidestreet alongside the   
		        
		hotel, the Blond drives her Porsche out of the underground   
		       parking...  
		        
		       Lombard scans Sunset a moment longer, turns back into the room,   
		        
		sees a bright HOTEL BROCHURE on a table... Picks it up, PROPS IT   
		       UP AGAINST THE WINDOW, draws  
		the curtain over it and...
 

       INT. 3RD FLOOR CORRIDOR, HYATT. DAY.
 
        
		...places a ĎDO NOT DISTURBí sign on the handle of door 337.
 

       INT. ROOM 504, MONDRIAN. DAY.
 
        
		THE RINGING TONE.  Lombard sits back in an armchair, smoking, his   
		       bare feet up on the DOUBLE  
		BED beside his case, waiting for his   
		       call to be answered while gazing gloomily out the window  
		at...  
		         
		       The Hyatt; THE BROCHURE IN THE WINDOW OF ROOM 337 IS  
		CLEARLY   
		       VISIBLE AGAINST THE DARK CURTAIN.  
		       He is about the  
		hang up when...  ĎHallo?í
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
 
                                
		DEBORAH (OS)  
		                   (after a  
		beat, hesitant)  
		                 Mr Lombard?
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 Have you got a pen?
 
                                
		DEBORAH (OS)  
		                 Just a moment...   
		Go ahead.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The Mondrian, room 504. The  
		number is 266   
		                 7548, plus the L.A.  
		code...
 
                               
		DEBORAH (O.S.)  
		                 ...7548. Have you...  
		Have you found him   
		                 yet?
 
        
		Lombard frowns - this hesitant woman doesnít sound like Deborah.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Are you all right?
 
                                
		DEBORAH (OS)  
		                 Yes... You woke me up...  
		Itís the middle   
		                 of the night here.  
		Have you found Mr   
		                 Friedman?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Not yet. The place I hoped  
		to find him   
		                 turns out to be little  
		more than a contact   
		                 address. Iíll  
		give it 24 hours. He just   
		                 might show  
		up.  
		                   (after a beat, off  
		her silence)  
		                 If you need to reach  
		me ask for Mr Lamont.   
		                 Paul Lamont,  
		all right?
 
                                
		DEBORAH (OS)  
		                 Paul Lamont...?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
 
        
		Lombard hangs up, sighs, stamps his cigarette...
 

       INT.ROOM 504.SEQUENCE.EVENING/NIGHT/DAWN.
 
        
		EVENING. Through the open window; A FLAME RED SUNSET... Down in   
		       the Hyatt forecourt, a steady  
		stream of limousines pull in...  
		       On the table, in red light, the remains of a meal, a half-empty  
		       bottle of wine... On the floor, a pack of Gitanes, a full ashtray,   
		        
		Lombardís watch... Then...  
		       LOMBARD, SOUND ASLEEP in his armchair by the window...
 
        
		NIGHT.  SILENCE. A TV flickers in the dark... Lombard stands at   
		       his open window... Across  
		Sunset, Friedmanís window is dark...   
		       SWISHHH... Lombard strikes a match, lights a cigarette,  
		flicks the   
		       match out the window...
 
       DAWN.  Lombard  
		is lying on the bed, eyes closed...  A SHUFFLING   
		       SOUND... He opens his eyes, alert, turns  
		to the door...  
		       On the carpet inside the door; ĎTHE LOS ANGELES TIMESí...
 
        
		Now Lombard is back at the window...  L.A. IS WAKING UP: shapes   
		       move in many of the Hyattís  
		windows... A ROADSWEEPER with an air   
		       blower blasts dust away from the hotel entrance...
 

        
		EXT. MONDRIAN RESTAURANT TERRACE. MORNING.
 
       BRIGHT SUN, a terrace overlooking L.A.   
		Lombard sits by a sky blue   
		       pool, smoking, leafing through ĎThe LA Timesí... A bustling   
		        
		EFFEMINATE HISPANIC WAITER turns to him.
 
                              
		EFFEMINATE WAITER  
		                 Good morning, sir.  
		How can I help you?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 A coffee and a couple of croissants.
 
                              
		EFFEMINATE WAITER  
		                 Crow what?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Croissants.
 
                              
		EFFEMINATE WAITER  
		                 Iím sorry, sir.  
		Could you try that again?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (after a beat,  
		irritated)  
		                 Croissants. Like that...
 
       And he points to the croissants at A YOUNG COUPLEís table.
 
                              
		EFFEMINATE WAITER  
		                 Oh! Crescents.
 
        
		Lombard looks the waiter up and down, raises his brows:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The word for those things  
		is croissants.
 
                              
		EFFEMINATE WAITER  
		                 Not in America,  
		sir. You must be from   
		                 Europe.  
		                    
		(off Lombardís frown; smiling)  
		                 So,  
		black coffee and a couple of   
		                 crescents.
 
        
		Incredulous, Lombard watches the waiter strut away, then turns   
		       back to his newspaper.  His  
		eyes fall on...  
		         
		       A HEADLINE: ďChild Agency Chief In Attack  
		On Defense ĎExpertí.Ē  
		         
		       Lombardís gaze shifts to... A B&amp;W  
		PHOTOGRAPH: A WOMAN PUSHING PAST   
		       REPORTERS, hair wild, eyes blazing in fury...   
		        
		The CAPTION reads:  ďMS Emily Stewart, Leaving Court.Ē...    
		       Back to the article... WE  
		READ: ďMs Emily Stewart, Chief Executive   
		       of the Orlando Bright Child Foundation, gave evidence  
		today in the   
		       case that has...Ē  
		       Reading, Lombard pulls his  
		Gitane stub from his lips and flicks it   
		       absent- mindedly away behind him...  
		        
		       HISSS... IT LANDS IN THE POOL...  
 

       INT. ROOM 405,  
		MONDRIAN. DAY/DUSK.
 
       Lombard is back at his window, scanning the Hyatt again, on the   
		        
		phone again...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Does Mr Gluck call for his  
		messages?
 
                             
		HYATT OPERATOR (OS)  
		                 Absolutely, sir.  
		As a matter of fact he   
		                 called this  
		morning, sir.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Next time he calls tell Mr  
		Gluck he better   
		                 be there to take  
		his calls at 9 tonight or   
		                 at 9 in  
		the morning if he cares about his   
		                  
		puppies. Got that?
 
                             
		HYATT OPERATOR (OS)  
		                 Got it. Puppies.
 
        
		Lombard hangs up... looks at his watch - 14:30... sighs...  
		         
		        
		DUSK.  SILENCE. Lombard is sound asleep on the bed, his head on   
		       the crumpled LA Times...  
		        
		       IN ON THE DOOR - A KNOCK... IN ON THE PHONE - RING RING... Lombard   
		        
		opens his eyes, sits up, groggy... The phone goes on ringing.    
		       Another knock at the door...  
		He checks his watch - 20:15 - frowns,   
		       clears his throat, stands, picks up the receiver; ĎHallo?í
 
                                
		DEBORAH (OS)  
		                 Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De  
		Moraes...
 
       And he puts the receiver down and makes for the door...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What is it?
 
                              
		MANíS VOICE (O.S.)  
		                 This is the hotel  
		supervisor, Mr Lamont.   
		                 Iím terribly  
		sorry to disturb you but   
		                 thereís  
		been a mix-up with our bookings   
		                 which  
		you might be able to help us   
		                 resolve.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What are you talking about?
 
                              
		MANíS VOICE (O.S)  
		                 We need a double-room  
		and as I understand   
		                 youíre here alone  
		weíd be much obliged if   
		                 youíd agree  
		to move to a single room...
 
       Annoyed, Lombard peers at... HIS DOUBLE BED... Opens the door...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I asked for a room facing...
 
        
		TWO MEN IN PORTER UNIFORMS, a small HISPANIC, a big BLOND...  The   
		       Hispanic grins, steps  
		forward... Lombard frowns... The Hispanic   
		       JABS A STUN GUN INTO HIS STOMACH... A CRACKLE... Lombard  
		cries   
		       out, is shoved back... hardly sees the TRUNCHEON in the big   
		        
		Blondís hand...   
		         
		       It CRACKS against his skull - BLACK OUT...TOTAL  
		SILENT BLACK OUT. 
 

       INT.  CAR TRUNK.  NIGHT.
 
        
		RISING, THE ROAR OF A CAR IN LOW GEAR.  BAD SUSPENSION THUMPS OVER   
		       ROUGH GROUND.  In  
		the darkness, becoming visible, Lombardís head   
		       pounding against car metal... blood glistens...  
		his eyes glint...    
		       Moaning, he wraps his arms around his head, enduring until...  
		        
		THE CAR COMES TO AN ABRUPT HALT.  Lombard crashes into the metal   
		       with a cry...  THE  
		ENGINE DIES... A COUPLE OF DOORS OPEN AND SLAM   
		       SHUT...  THE SOUND OF MUFFLED CONVERSATION...   
		       The trunk swings open... A BLINDING TORCH BEAM hits Lombard... He   
		        
		shields his eyes behind bloody hands, his face and hair also wet   
		       with blood... We hear FRIEDMANíS  
		VOICE (the German-accented   
		       Ďpuppiesí voice). 
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 What is this blood?  
		I told you not to   
		                 injure him.
 
                              
		HISPANIC MAN (OS)  
		                 We didnít do that.  
		He must have gotten   
		                 thrown around  
		on the last stretch of road.
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 Huh! Do you have his  
		belongings?
 
                                
		BIG MAN (OS)  
		                 Yeah.
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 Get him out.
 
        
		Two pairs of hands grab hold of Lombard, lift him out and...  
		         
		        
		EXT. NIGHT. ...he hits the sandy ground in front of a pair of   
		       polished shoes.    
		        
		Lombard tries to look up from the shoes, is blinded by a torch   
		       beam, lifts his hands to shield  
		his eyes...  Above, through the   
		       dazzle of the torch, against the dark sky, the shape of  
		a head and   
		       shoulders...  He groans:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Friedman...
 
        
		The torch is thrust closer to his face... Now, at the edge of its   
		       beam, Lombard sees... A MANíS  
		MOUTH, tight-lipped.  The lips   
		       move... a throat clearing sound... the lips open...   
		        
		SPLATTT... A thick spurt of spittle lands on Lombardís hand...
 
                               
		FRIEDMAN (OS)    
		                 Imbecile!
 
        
		A kick in the head sends Lombard onto his front, face in the sand.  
 
                                
		FRIEDMAN (OS)  
		                 Go ahead!
 
        
		And someone sits on Lombardís back, pins down his arms...  LOMBARD   
		       CRIES OUT...  IN  
		ON Lombard as, teeth gritted, winded by the   
		       weight on his back, he cranes his head up and around  
		to see...  
		       In the torchlight - A NEEDLE STUCK INTO HIS ARM through his shirt,   
		        
		the brownish liquid in the syringe slowly being emptied into him.  
		       His eyes fill with horror...  
		He wails: ĎNon...í  
		       The syringe is empty, the needle yanked out of his arm...  
		        
		A DEAFENING HUM AS WHITE LIGHT FLOODS THE SCREEN...  Lombard cries   
		       out again: ĎNonnnn...í  
		his voice A DISTANT CRY...
 

       DRUG-INDUCED SEQUENCE.   
		         
		        
		INT. PARKED RENAULT, PARIS. DAWN.
 
       A DAWN NIGHTMARE... ALL SOUNDS ECHOING...    
		        
		A SUDDEN HUSH... THEN, COMING CLEAR... FOOTSTEPS PATTERING... THE   
		       SOUND OF BREATHING...  
		        
		SNAP!  Red fingernails snap an elastic band around a pony-tail of   
		       blond hair...   
		        
		A goodlooking woman, MARTINE, checks her lipstick in the rearview   
		       mirror..  
		        
		A GROAN... On the back seat: TWO CHILDREN, a boy and a girl, sleep   
		       under a white blanket...  
		        
		CLATTER... Martineís hands clear the cluttered dashboard of maps,   
		       sunglasses, cigarettes...   
		CLICK... She opens the glove   
		       compartment...    
		       IN ON  
		Martine... A PISSED OFF FROWN....
 
       EXT. RENAULT.  Martineís arm is out the passenger  
		window, a   
		       HANDGUN hanging limp from between her thumb and forefinger...
 
                                
		MARTINE (OS)  
		                 Laurent...
 
        
		IN ON a manís hand, WITH WEDDING BAND, clasping a rope...   
		       IN ON the man, Lombard - a different  
		man, younger, softer, with   
		       longish hair.  A Gitane burns in his mouth as... with his hands  
		on   
		       the ropes that fasten the canoes and fishing rods to the carís   
		        
		roofrack, he peers stoically at the gun...
 
       EXT. AVENUE.  FOOTSTEPS ECHOING.  Lombard  
		carries the gun into an   
		       apartment building 20 yards along from the Renault... 
 
        
		INT. RENAULT.  CLACK... as Martine pushes a tape into the cassette   
		       player: SINATRA SINGS:  
		#... Letís take it nice and easy...#
 
       INT. FOYER.  SWISHH... The lift doors slide open...  
		Lombard gets   
		       in... reaches for button 5, as...   
		       THE ERRATIC  
		PURR OF A CRUISING CAR OUTSIDE... IN ON Lombard; a   
		       frown... a thought... a look of dread...
 
        
		EXT. AVENUE.  Lombard bursts out into the street and stops dead...   
		       Sinatra sings: #...The  
		problem now of course is, to simply hold   
		       your horses...#  
		        
		A PEUGEOT, coming towards Lombard, nears the Renault with its   
		       passenger door SLIGHTLY OPEN...   
		       SILENCE as Lombard stares at.... A manís hand clutching an object   
		        
		under the door... The fingers let go... TOC, TOC, TOC... A GRENADE   
		       GENTLY BOUNCES ON THE TARMAC  
		AND ROLLS UNDER THE RENAULT...  
		       SINATRA SINGS ON.  Lombard looks up... Martine is reaching  
		into   
		       the back of the Renault, unaware... THE PEUGEOT TYRES SCREAM...   
		        
		Lombard turns... IN ON THE TWO MEN LOOMING BEHIND THE WINDSCREEN   
		       of the fast approaching Peugeot...  
		GRINNING AS THEY LOCK EYES WITH   
		       LOMBARD who... throws himself between parked cars to avoid being  
		       hit... The Peugeot roars past and away... Lombard jumps back to   
		        
		his feet...  
		       IN ON Martine through the windscreen; bewildered, she gapes at... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 MARTINE! Get out! Get the  
		Hell out!
 
       Martine understands, moves as if to open her door and...    
		        
		BOOM... SHE IS ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FIRE.  SILENCE AGAIN.
 
       EXT. DESERT. DAY.   
		IN ON Lombard; head against sun-baked sand,   
		       shaggy-haired, lips cracked and sand-caked, he gazes  
		up at...   
		       A HAZY VISION: a YOUNG BOY peering down in fascination... A YOUNG   
		        
		GIRL appears beside him; a scowl of fear and disgust...  
		       Lombardís lips move as he tries to speak...  
		He cannot... IN ON his   
		       WEDDING-BAND HAND; he lifts it from the sand.  It flops back...  
		        
		Now, WIDE FROM ABOVE - Lombard, dressed in BAGGY JEANS, A   
		       ĎBUDWEISERí T-SHIRT AND WORN-OUT SNEAKERS,  
		lies prostrate, lost in   
		       the wilderness.  The two children stand over him... 
 
        
		EXT. STREETS, PARIS. DAWN.  SOUND OF SOBBING THROUGH RUNNING   
		       FOOTSTEPS.  Lombard, CRYING,  
		runs along an empty street... Now   
		       along a boulevard... Running... Running...
 
        
		EXT. ĎLA SANT…í PRISON. DAWN.  PANTING AND RUNNING FOOTSTEPS.  The   
		       prison, peaceful  
		in the dawn... Lombard runs into shot...
 
       INT. PRISON RECEPTION. DAWN.  SILENCE.   
		With a shaky hand but his   
		       face dead calm, Lombard signs a form, pushes it to a WARDER...
 
        
		INT. PRISON CORRIDOR.  FOOTSTEPS ECHOING, GATES CLANGING SHUT.    
		       Lombard follows ANOTHER  
		WARDER...
 
       INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM.  SILENCE.  Lombard peers at... Across a   
		        
		sea of empty tables, an INMATE, in pyjamas, a sneer on his sleepy   
		       face... Lombard waits for the  
		warder to leave, pulls out his gun   
		       and makes for the inmate, the gun held out in front in both  
		       hands....
 
       EXT. DESERT. DAY.  IN ON Lombard; HATRED,  
		as he murmurs:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I shouldíve killed you when  
		I first laid   
		                 hands on you, scumbag!  
		Your little brother   
		                 just missed me!  
		Your little brother just   
		                 missed me...
 
        
		IN ON A CHILD HANDS prising the wedding band from Lombardís   
		       finger.
 
        
		INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM.  The inmate sits petrified, eyeing...   
		       Lombardís gun nearing him...  
		A COMMOTION from the doorway...  
		       Lombard stops, looks back over his shoulder...   
		        
		In the doorway, INSPECTEUR MOREAU, in a sweat, looks straight back   
		       at him, eyes pained: ĎDonít  
		do it...í  
		       IN ON Lombard staring at Moreau; DEAD EYES...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Je sais, Moreau. But I canít  
		die. I   
		                 canít...
 
        
		IN ON his finger, pulling the trigger.  BANG!... THE SCREEN FLOODS   
		       RED...  FLAMING  
		RED... A FLAMING SUN... BEATING DOWN...
 
                                                      
		END OF SEQUENCE
 

       INT. BEDROOM, RANCH. DAY/EVENING.
 
        
		A SPEAR OF SUNLIGHT FALLS ACROSS COLD BLUE ADOLESCENT EYES   
		       WATCHING... Lombardís head against  
		a white pillow, cleaned up and   
		       shaven but covered in sweat, muttering wildly to himself with  
		his   
		       eyes closed... Now he opens his eyes, stares, sits up   
		        
		(barechested) and sees...  
		       The adolescent (jeans, T-shirt), a rifle across his lap, eyes him   
		        
		from a chair... He stands, hurries out, leaving the door open.  We   
		       hear his feet on the  
		stairs...  
		       Lombard scans the room... Heís in an old timber bed with a home-  
		        
		made quilt... bare floorboards, patterned fabrics, papered walls,   
		       a jug and bowl, an oil lamp  
		beside the bed - all old and clean, as   
		       if heíd arrived in the past... He examines his arm...  
		A bruise   
		       where he was stabbed with the needle...  He turns to...  
		        
		       The window; a FEW CHILDREN play by a shabby PICK-UP TRUCK parked   
		        
		near a stone well... A donkey and some bony cattle graze lazily in   
		       pasture... Beyond, a colourless  
		desert landscape... WE HEAR a   
		       MANíS VOICE:
 
                               
		MANíS VOICE (OS)  
		                 Youíre no citizen  
		of these United States,   
		                 are you?
 
        
		Lombard turns... AN OLD COWBOY in a leather waistcoat eyeballs him   
		       from the doorway, a rifle  
		hanging at the end of his arm...
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY  
		                 And you ainít neither one  
		of those damned   
		                 Mexicans who end  
		up littering the   
		                 landscape after  
		getting ripped-off by   
		                 their friendly  
		cross- border guides, are   
		                 you, mister?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he clears his  
		throat, then:)  
		                 No...
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY  
		                   (walking into  
		the room)  
		                 I didnít think so. The rags  
		on their sorry   
		                 backs are the only  
		wordly possessions   
		                 those wretched  
		creatures are ever found   
		                 with...  
		                   (he stops by the bed,  
		searching his   
		                    waistcoat  
		pocket)  
		                 I donít wanna know who you  
		are or how come   
		                 you ended up roasting  
		in Owl Canyon. But   
		                 you might as well  
		know Iíd have let you   
		                 fry to a buzzard  
		meal if not for this...
 
       And he tosses... LOMBARDíS WEDDING BAND lands on the quilt...
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY   
		                 Now, can you stand up?  
		                    
		(off Lombardís puzzled look: ĎWhat?í)  
		                  
		Can you use your legs and stand up?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I... How long have I been  
		here?
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY  
		                 Three days and thatís three  
		days too   
		                 many.Come on. Get your ass  
		up.
 
       Lombard frowns, then proceeds to get out of bed, slowly,   
		        
		grimacing... until he stands on shaky legs, in a pair of shorts...
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY  
		                 Huh... I guess you ainít  
		quite ready for   
		                 civilisation yet...  
		Iíll give you one more   
		                 day, a meal,  
		and then youíre on your way.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Los Angeles?
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY  
		                   (a beat, he  
		raises his brows)  
		                 Los Angeles is 100  
		miles away.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he frowns, sits  
		back on the bed)  
		                 Iíd appreciate it  
		if I could use your   
		                 phone.
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY  
		                 Iím sure you would. But  
		if I had one, I   
		                 wouldnít let you  
		near it. Now you tuck   
		                 back in and  
		rest until youíre told   
		                 otherwise.  
		                    
		(he turns, makes for the door)  
		                 And  
		for what itís worth, I wouldnít try   
		                  
		anything that might be construed as   
		                  
		unappreciative of my hospitality. Iíd   
		                  
		sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
 
       And the Old Cowboy leaves, closing the door behind  
		him... Lombard,   
		       sombre, picks up his wedding band, puts it back on his finger,   
		        
		eyeing... ON A WICKER CHAIR, a neat pile; the jeans, T-Shirt and   
		       sneakers he was found in...
 
                                                             
		CUT TO:
 
       EVENING. By the light of the oil lamp (a half-eaten steak on a   
		        
		plate beside it) Lombard sits up in bed, trying to roll a   
		       cigarette...from below WE HEAR...
 
                      
		OLD COWBOY, WOMAN &amp; CHILDREN (OS)  
		                  
		...For what we are about to receive, may   
		                  
		the Lord make us truly thankful...
 

       EXT. DESERT. DAY.
 
        
		The shabby pick-up truck travels in a cloud of dust along A DIRT   
		       TRACK...
 

        
		EXT. ROADSIDE. DAY.
 
       A straight Tarmac road cuts through the desert. The pick-up truck   
		        
		idles where the dirt track meets the road, the Old Cowboy at the   
		       wheel.  Lombard (back in  
		Bud T-shirt, jeans, sneakers) stands in   
		       the open passenger door...
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY  
		                 Barstowís 30 miles to the  
		left. Los   
		                 Angeles a hundred to the  
		right. Wherever   
		                 youíre heading, I  
		reckon somebodyíll pick   
		                 you up. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 (squinting in the direction  
		of LA)  
		                 Huh... I suppose the idea of  
		a one day   
		                 trip to Los Angeles doesnít  
		appeal to   
		                 you...
 
                                 
		OLD COWBOY  
		                 Is that where lawyers toil  
		for an industry   
		                 that turns serial  
		killers into heroes who   
		                 give thrills  
		to young women who write   
		                 erotic novels  
		about psychopaths and   
		                 rapists?  
		                  
		(off Lombardís look: ĎIs it?í)  
		                 You  
		go to your world, Iíll stay in mine.   
		                  
		So long, Mister.
 
       Lombard peers at the old cowboy... grins and slams the door... The   
		        
		old cowboy revs away, does a U-turn and drives back along the   
		       track in a cloud of dust...   
		Lombard sighs... peers right where   
		       the road joins the horizon...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Los Angeles, ŗ droite...
 

        
		EXT. HYATT/MONDRIAN, SUNSET BOULEVARD. DAY.
 
       Lombard stands at the kerb peering up at...   
		The Hyatt, across the   
		       boulevard... The BROCHURE is still there in Friedmanís window... 
 

       INT. RECEPTION/LOBBY, MONDRIAN. AFTERNOON.
 
       Lombard  
		waits at the desk, ignoring the looks from GUESTS and   
		       STAFF around him, his eyes on...   
		A YOUNG RECEPTIONIST, on the   
		       phone... He mutters a ĎThank youí, hangs up, turns to Lombard with  
		       a tight smile.
 
                              
		YOUNG RECEPTIONIST  
		                 Iím sorry, Mr Lamont.  
		According to our   
		                 records no personal  
		property was found in   
		                 room 504 after  
		settlement of the account.
 
       Lombard nods, put out but not surprised... asks:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Could you tell me who settled  
		my bill?
 
       The receptionist pulls a face, taps into the deskís terminal...
 
                              
		YOUNG RECEPTIONIST  
		                 No. It was a cash  
		payment. Iím sorry.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat; he nods  
		again)  
		                 Let me see your phone directory,  
		will you?  
		                   (off the receptionistís  
		look,   
		                    snapping)  
		                  
		Your phone directory!
 
       CUT TO: Lombardís hand ripping a page from a telephone directory.
 

       EXT. OCEAN AVENUE, SANTA MONICA. AFTERNOON.
 
       Santa  
		Monica pier stretches out into the Pacific... Strollers   
		       stroll... A cluster of scheming YOUNG  
		MALES... VAGRANTS watch   
		       rollerblading TEENAGERS display their skills around cones along   
		        
		the promenade... WE FIND...   
		         
		       Lombard, on the kerb, peering  
		at...  A SMALL MULTI-STOREY   
		       BUILDING... IN ON A PLAQUE by the door;   
		        
		  ď... 4th Floor: ORLANDO BRIGHT CHILD FOUNDATION...Ē  
 

       INT. CORRIDOR. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		ANOTHER PLAQUE, on a metal door: ďORLANDO BRIGHT CHILD...Ē  
		       A SECURITY GUARD dozes at a desk beside  
		it (a desk clearly not   
		       meant to be there: it restricts access to further down the   
		        
		corridor)... THE SOUND OF LIFT DOORS OPENING... The Guard looks   
		       up... Lombard steps out... peers  
		at the guard (already   
		       suspicious)... sees the plaque... makes for the desk...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Mrs Stewart?
 
                               
		SECURITY GUARD  
		                 You got an appointment?
 
        
		Lombard glances at the door... NO HANDLE... it can only be opened   
		       with a key or electrically  
		perhaps... He grins at the guard...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Could you tell Mrs Stewart  
		that Mr Paul   
		                 Lamont wants to see  
		her. Itís important.
 
       The guard eyeballs Lombard... pushes an intercom button... 
 
                               
		SECURITY GUARD  
		                 Thereís a Mr Lamont  
		out here for Ms   
		                 Stewart. Says itís  
		important but no   
		                 appointment...
 
        
		Silence as Lombard and the guard eyeball each other, waiting...  
		       The door opens, revealing... a  
		BESPECTACLED YOUNG MAN (genial   
		       type); he smiles at the guard, turns to Lombard; a sceptical frown  
		       forms on his face... 
 
                            
		BESPECTACLED YOUNG MAN  
		                 Er, good afternoon,  
		Mr Lamont... Ms   
		                 Stewart is in a meeting  
		right now. Perhaps   
		                 if you could let  
		me know what you wish to   
		                 discuss  
		I could arrange an appointment for   
		                  
		you to see her.
 
       Lombard peers over the young manís shoulder through the door...  
		        
		A BRIGHTLY COLOURED RECEPTION - cheerful posters and childrenís   
		       drawings on the walls... Jars  
		of sweets...    
		       Lombard eyes the young man... the guard... turns to the lift...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Tell Ms Stewart Iíll be outside.  
		And she   
		                 better come if the purpose  
		of this set-up   
		                 of yours is to help  
		kids rather than to   
		                 provide you with  
		an easy living.
 

       EXT. PROMENADE, SANTA MONICA. AFTERNOON/EVENING.
 
        
		Lombard sits on a bench, gazing pensively across the beach...    
		       Beyond the rollerblading  
		teenagers, A YOUNG COUPLE IN SWIMSUITS   
		       argue near the ocean...
 
                                 
		EMILY (OS)  
		                 Mr Lamont?
 
        
		Lombard looks up, squinting in the sun...  
		       EMILY (30s, attractive, well-dressed, a huge battered  
		handbag over   
		       her shoulder) stands above him, the Security Guard beside her...  
		        
		       IN ON Emily; she frowns, not liking what she sees... Then, hard,   
		        
		professional: 
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Emily Stewart. The Ďeasy livingí  
		lady. If   
		                 this concerns a child or  
		childrenís well-  
		                 being, I suggest  
		you contact the police.   
		                 The foundation  
		is not a law enforcement   
		                 agency.
 
        
		Lombard smiles his charming smile... gets to his feet, holds out a   
		       hand.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím afraid itís not that simple.  
		Good   
		                 afternoon, Miss Stewart.
 
        
		She hesitates, grabs his hand, shakes it with a nod, pulls her   
		       hand away.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (to the security  
		guard)  
		                 Iíd rather speak to Miss Stewart  
		alone.   
		                 You can watch from the next  
		bench if you   
		                 like.
 
        
		The guard turns to... Emily eyeballs Lombard... decides to... She   
		       signals to the guard itís okay...  
		The guard scowls at Lombard and   
		       walks away...   
		       Lombard and  
		Emily watch him cross the street back towards the   
		       building, then turn back to face each other...  
		He smiles... She   
		       sends him an icy grin...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 May I ask where youíre from,  
		Mr Lamont?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Europe...  
		                    
		(off her look)  
		                 France. Iím French  
		but I live in London...  
		                    
		(deliberately elaborating)  
		                 ... England.
 
                                    
		EMILY   
		                   (surprise,  
		then scepticism in her   
		                     
		eyes)  
		                 Youíre a long way from home...
 
        
		Lombard nods, grins... indicates the bench and sits down himself,   
		       asking:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You wouldnít have a cigarette,  
		would you?
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 I donít smoke. If you could  
		get to the   
		                 point...
 
        
		Lombard grins again...  peers at her, thinking... He glances at...   
		       Her hands, clutching  
		her handbag to her skirt...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Youíre sure you wonít sit  
		down, Miss   
		                 Stewart?
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Iím fine standing, thank you.
 
        
		Lombard nods... goes for for it...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Am I right in thinking someone  
		in your   
		                 line of work is aware of  
		the existence of   
		                 child traffickers,  
		Miss Stewart?
 
       Emily stares down at him, intrigued... She nods...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Good...   
		                    
		(a beat)  
		                 Iím a private investigator.  
		Iím here on   
		                 the trail of an Austrian  
		child procurer. I   
		                 cannot say if his  
		operation extends to   
		                 your country  
		but I doubt heís here to   
		                 enjoy the  
		sunshine.  
		                   (pauses to let  
		her take in his words)  
		                 I believe he  
		killed a man I was hired to   
		                 find  
		back in London. A few days ago he   
		                  
		also tried to kill me. He didnít succeed   
		                  
		but itís left me stranded without money,   
		                  
		passport or a decent wardrobe in this   
		                  
		distant land... I need help to finish what   
		                  
		I came here to do, Miss Stewart - to find   
		                  
		him and, perhaps, see to it that he   
		                  
		doesnít hurt anyone again... Your help,   
		                  
		Miss Stewart.
 
       IN ON Emily; her expression shifting with conflicting thoughts...   
		        
		Her eyes move down to his T-shirt... She glares...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Is this some kind of sick stunt?  
		Let me   
		                 guess.  You want money,  
		right?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 A small loan would be welcome.  
		More   
		                 urgently, I need access to a  
		telephone and   
		                 an address where things  
		can be sent to me.
 
       IN ON Emily, something close to hate in her eyes... She turns to   
		        
		the ocean, as if to shake her thoughts, muttering angrily:
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 I canít believe this...  
		                    
		(back to Lombard)  
		                 Whatís coming now,  
		eh? If I donít pay all   
		                 Hellís gonna  
		break loose, is that it?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (with a mystified  
		frown)  
		                 Well, Iíd sooner mug an old  
		lady...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 You... (She screams:) Jesus  
		Christ!
 
       The rollerblading kids nearby stop and turn to them as Emily leans   
		        
		forward, pointing a finger in Lombardís face:
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Listen and listen well, Mister!  
		I donít   
		                 care if youíre just sick  
		or if some other   
		                 sick mind put you  
		up to this. Either way,   
		                 donít you  
		ever come to my office or cross   
		                 my  
		path again, you hear? Ever!
 
       And, as she turns to go, Lombard swiftly grabs hold of her wrist,  
		       pulls her back, glares into her eyes...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Maybe you didnít hear me right,  
		so Iíll   
		                 say it again; I need help,  
		Emily. Maybe my   
		                 creepís kids donít  
		come from your streets.   
		                 And maybe  
		you donít care much about boys   
		                 and  
		girls in faraway places being   
		                 sodomised  
		and killed. Hey, this is   
		                 America,  
		right! But just now the  man is   
		                  
		here. Amongst your children. And wherever   
		                  
		he goes, his poison follows. Have a nice   
		                  
		walk back to your office, Emily. 
 
       And Lombard letís go of her... The rollerblading kids  
		stand   
		       gawking around them... IN ON Emily; a flustered stare... IN ON   
		        
		Lombard; a flicker of hope...  
		       Emily grimaces, something almost grotesque, turns and storms   
		        
		away... Lombard watches her go... turns back towards the   
		       promenade...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Merde!  
		                    
		(to the gawking teenagers)  
		                 Keep on  
		playing, you little shits!
 
       And he glares beyond them to... The couple on the beach, still  
		       arguing...  
		       We see him briefly from behind, perhaps from Emilyís  
		POV, his bent   
		       back as he slumps forwards, bringing his hands up to his face...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (wearily rubbing  
		his eyes)  
		                 Merde, merde et remerde...
 
        
		A RUSTLING NOISE; Lombard looks sideways through his fingers...  
		       Emily sits on his bench, rummaging  
		in her bag... He lowers his   
		       hands, prepares to speak but... from the resolve in her face he   
		        
		decides to let her lead...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Okay. The woman just canít walk  
		away...  
		                   (a beat)  
		                  
		I want straight answers. No hesitation or   
		                  
		I walk for sure. Why canít you go to your   
		                  
		Embassy?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 French people need a visa  
		to enter this   
		                 country. That takes  
		time and I didnít have   
		                 any. I used  
		a British passport. My nameís   
		                 not  
		Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
 
       Emily stops searching her overflowing handbag, turns  
		to him,   
		       guffaws: ĎHuh!í... then resumes her search...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Where were you staying before  
		the attempt   
		                 on your life and why  
		canít you go back   
		                 there?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The Mondrian, room 504. I  
		was checked out   
		                 in my absence.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 By your Austrian?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Yeah.
 
        
		At last she pulls A PEN AND NOTEPAD from her bag... turns to   
		       Lombard, scrutinizes him, and...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 You donít know why heís come  
		to Los   
		                 Angeles?  
		                    
		(off Lombardís look; ĎNoí)  
		                 The man  
		you say he killed? Who was he? A   
		                  
		colleague of his?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No. A poor little rich boy  
		who thought   
		                 heíd save a few kids  
		from their retailer.   
		                 He disappeared  
		on his second shopping   
		                 expedition.
 
        
		Emily tightens her lips; she finds his choice of words   
		       distasteful... She holds out the pen and  
		notepad...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 I need a few numbers where I  
		can check you   
		                 out. And donít tell  
		me you canít.
 
       Lombard nods, grins, takes the notepad... opens it on his lap and   
		        
		starts writing...  Emily watches him writing for a moment, then...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Have you never heard of collect  
		calls,   
		                 Mr...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Lombard...  
		                    
		(he understands, grins...)  
		                 It will  
		take a few days for the things I   
		                  
		need to get here. Meanwhile Iíd sooner not   
		                  
		draw police attention walking the streets   
		                  
		like a hungry dog...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 There are over 4 million people  
		in this   
		                 city - why me?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I thought youíd never ask...  
		As I was   
		                 having my coffee and crescents  
		at the   
		                 Mondrian the other morning  
		I spotted your   
		                 photograph in the  
		Los Angeles Times...   
		                 Thereís a tough  
		lady, I thought. Just the   
		                 kind who  
		might help me... 
 
       Emily frowns. Lombard hands back the notepad... As she looks over   
		        
		his list:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Janeís infatuated with me,  
		so try not to   
		                 shatter her dreams.  
		Mr Oakís my landlord,   
		                 so Iíd rather  
		you didnít call him.   
		                 Nathalie is...  
		Nathalie is Nathalie. And   
		                 Moreau  
		is a cop. Heís in Paris, the others   
		                  
		in London. Sorry, thatís all I can do. I   
		                  
		donít have that many friends...
 
       Emily raises her brows - ĎReally!í- shoves the notepad into  
		her   
		       bag... 
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 You know where to look for your  
		Austrian,   
		                 right?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I know where to look.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                   (she gets to her  
		feet)  
		                 I might come back, I might not.  
		But if I   
		                 do, it wonít be for a couple  
		of hours.
 
       Lombard grins...  She turns away and starts towards her   
		        
		building... Lombard turns back towards the ocean, frowns, turns   
		       and calls after her:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Emily?  
		                    
		(she turns back)  
		                 I could do with a  
		cigarette and something   
		                 to eat...  
		Iíll pay you back.
 
       IN ON Emily; she hesitates... sighs... starts searching her   
		        
		handbag...  
		         
		       EVENING. MOONLIGHT plays on the choppy sea...  
		SWISH: A MATCH FLAME   
		       HELD TO A CIGARETTE BETWEEN A VAGRANTíS LIPS... ĎThanks, maní.    
		        
		Lombard, on his bench, a cigarette between his lips, waves bye   
		       to... the vagrant strolls away  
		tugging a loaded trolley behind   
		       him... A SHOUT:
 
                                 
		EMILY (OS)  
		                 Mr Lombard!
 
        
		Lombard looks back... then up... A FOURTH FLOOR WINDOW: Emily...
 

       INT. SEQUENCE. ORLANDO  
		BRIGHT FOUNDATION. EVENING.
 
       THE RECEPTION AREA - dimly lit and deserted at this hour...   
		       Lombard follows Emily who talks in rapid, professional mode...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 The foundation was set up 8  
		years ago by   
		                 Orlando Brightís parents.  
		Orlando died as   
		                 a result of repeated  
		sexual abuse and a   
		                 systematic draining  
		of his blood in what   
		                 pathologists  
		could only describe as a

		                 while riding  
		his bike to school...
 
       A CORRIDOR - more cheery posters and childrenís drawings...   
		Emily   
		       goes on walking, Lombard following behind her...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 When his body was found in a  
		wood four   
		                 weeks later, his ankle  
		was broken and bore   
		                 the scar of a  
		tight shackle. He was   
		                 nine...
 
        
		She pauses at a door marked: ĎINTERVIEW ROOMí, calls inside:  
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Iíll be in my office...
 
        
		Over her shoulder Lombard glimpses... A brightly painted   
		       conference room... A BOY sits on a carpet  
		scattered with toys.    
		       WHITNEY (young, tired-looking) kneels beside him... She nods...   
		        
		Emily shuts the door and walks on...
 
                                   
		EMILY    
		                 Our team includes doctors,  
		therapists,   
		                 social workers and volunteers.  
		We try to   
		                 help abused kids cope with  
		their   
		                 memories,...
 
        
		ANOTHER CORRIDOR, similar to the last.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 ...Offer what support we can  
		to the   
		                 families of disappeared children.  
		Monitor   
		                 court cases. Compile dossiers  
		of   
		                 disturbing information that comes  
		in, and   
		                 spend way too much time trying

		                 funds and convince law enforcement  
		                 agencies of the reality of the perverse  
		                 practices that go on in this beautiful  
		                 world...
 
        
		She opens a door, switches on the light, motions for Lombard to go   
		       in...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Fortunately some corporations  
		think itís   
		                 good PR to be associated  
		with a child-care   
		                 agency.  Their

		END OF SEQUENCE
 

       INT. EMILYíS OFFICE. EVENING.
 
        
		Crammed with filing cabinets.  One large desk, computer   
		       terminal...  Emily shuts the  
		door, makes for a coffee machine,   
		       still talking...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Thereíve been 7 international  
		treaties   
		                 since 1904 aimed at preventing  
		child   
		                 slavery. But still no worldwide  
		body   
		                 dedicated to investigating the  
		                 maltreatment of children used in  
		sexual   
		                 exploitation. Officially,  
		itís just not   
		                 called for. Sit down.  
		Can I offer you some   
		                 coffee?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I wouldnít mind. Thank you.
 
        
		As Emily busies about the coffee machine, Lombard settles in a   
		       chair in front of the large desk,  
		scanning the walls...  
		       POSTERS everywhere: one lists the centerís sponsors: McDonalds,   
		        
		Toshiba, Disney... Another advertises the Anti-Slavery Society...   
		       A wall is papered with posters  
		of MISSING CHILDREN, issued by The   
		       National Center For Missing And Exploited Children; each with  
		       about 30 SMILING LITTLE FACES...    
		       Sitting at the desk  
		with a coffee in a DISPOSABLE CUP, Emily   
		       follows Lombardís gaze towards... A HUGE SAFE with a  
		combination   
		       lock.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 A recent acquisition. Weíve  
		had four break-  
		                 ins this year alone;  
		files stolen,   
		                 computers wrecked,  
		faeces smeared on   
		                 walls. The good  
		guys dismiss us as   
		                 alarmist do-gooders;  
		the bad guys will   
		                 risk prison to  
		intimidate and rob us. An   
		                 easy living  
		indeed, Mr Lombard.  
		                   (she  
		grins, pushes the coffee to   
		                     
		Lombard)  
		                 I got through to Moreau and  
		Jane. I left   
		                 your landlord out of  
		it. Your flatís been   
		                 broken into.  
		Jane wants you to call her   
		                 back.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Hah... What about Nathalie?
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 No answer. You have no passport  
		and your   
		                 Embassyís out. How do you  
		plan to leave   
		                 the U.S., Mr Lombard?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat as he  
		is taken aback; then:)  
		                 Iím sure Iíll  
		find a way.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Like youíll find a way to stop  
		your   
		                 Austrian killing you a second  
		time round?
 
       Lombard grins, but thereís irritation in his eyes... He reaches   
		        
		for the coffee...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thank you for the guided tour,  
		but would   
		                 you mind telling me what  
		weíre doing here?
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 How come youíre alive? Child  
		traffickers   
		                 usually achieve what  
		they set out to do.  
		                   (off  
		Lombardís frown)  
		                 What am I really  
		looking at here, huh?  
		                    
		(off Lombardís scowl)  
		                 Are you really  
		not just a lousy private   
		                 eye? Am  
		I really looking at some kind of   
		                  
		cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (after a beat,  
		peering into her eyes)  
		                 Did you call  
		me up here to enjoy yourself,   
		                 Emily,  
		or to let me use your phone?   
		                 Because  
		we seem to have a slight   
		                 problem...
 
                                
		WHITNEY (OS)  
		                 Weíre the ones with a  
		problem, Mr Lombard.
 
       Lombard turns to...  Whitney eyes him from the doorway...
 
                                   
		WHITNEY  
		                 You and you alone know of  
		a child   
		                 trafficker who you say might  
		be here   
		                 plying his trade. We donít  
		think thatís   
		                 right. We want his name,  
		his addresses in   
		                 LA and London, and  
		anything you have on   
		                 any of his associates...  
		In short,   
		                 everything you know.
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; a bemused frown...  He turns back to Emily...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Whitney Armstrong, my deputy.  
		What   
		                 Whitneyís trying to say is that  
		you might   
		                 not live to tell the tale  
		next time you   
		                 meet your Austrian...
 
                                   
		WHITNEY  
		                 And losing you, weíd lose  
		him. And that   
		                 would be a shame, donít  
		you agree?
 
       Scowling, Lombard watches Whitney settle onto the chair beside   
		        
		him.
 
                                   
		WHITNEY  
		                 Hi...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 If you have hard evidence about  
		a child   
		                 trafficker, we want it, Mr  
		Lombard. And we   
		                 want it before you  
		get yourself killed...
 
                                   
		WHITNEY  
		                 Most of our information comes  
		out of the   
		                 mouths of babes, Mr Lombard  
		- confused and   
		                 frightened victims.  
		Itís all too easily   
		                 discredited,  
		you understand. Now, you   
		                 might be  
		just what weíve been waiting for.   
		                  
		Your information could be enough to make   
		                  
		Ďem sit up and listen.
 
       Lombard peers at Whitney, teeth clenched...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Itís give and take time, Mr  
		Lombard. You   
		                 need help, we need information.  
		You didnít   
		                 really expect me to put  
		my ass on the line   
		                 helping a criminal  
		just for the thrill of   
		                 it, did you?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat; he swallows  
		hard)  
		                 A criminal?
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Did you not enter this country  
		illegally?
 
       Lombard glares... Then, between clenched teeth, screwing up his   
		        
		eyes...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Huh... I have no... (a beat)...  
		hard   
		                 evidence...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed  
		your man   
		                 all the way here from Europe.  
		You told me   
		                 you knew where to find  
		him, remember? Or   
		                 didnít I hear you  
		right?
 
       IN ON Lombard; rage... IN ON his fingers tightening around the   
		        
		paper cup in his hand. It caves in: COFFEE SPILLS OVER HIS T-SHIRT   
		       AND LAP... He curses... ĎNom  
		de...í  
		       He turns to Emily, grinning, doing his best to sound calm...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 As I recall, you asked if  
		I knew where to   
		                 look for him, Emily.  
		I said I did. Even in   
		                 English that  
		doesnít mean ĎI know where he   
		                 is.í  
		                    
		(he slams the crushed cup on her desk)  
		                  
		Now, I appreciate what you ladies are   
		                  
		doing here. But I have nothing for you. I   
		                  
		wouldnít worry, though. The man is slimy.   
		                  
		I reckon when I find him Iíll find slime.   
		                  
		I promise Iíll share it with you...    
		                  
		Before I die...
 
       SILENCE. Emily and Whitney exchange a heavy glance... Emily is not   
		        
		convinced, turns back to Lombard, unflinching...  IN ON Lombard; a   
		       rueful grin... Now Emily  
		gently rocks her head to and fro...   
		       glances back at... Whitney purses her lips, shakes her head  
		- ĎI   
		       Donít knowí - ... and Emily turns back to Lombard, opens a drawer,   
		        
		pulls out a box of tissues, tosses it to him...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Dry yourself up...  
		                    
		(she turns the phone and a notepad to   
		                     
		him)  
		                 The address is my home. Which  
		I guess is   
		                 also where youíll be sleeping  
		tonight.  
		                   (she stands,  
		signals Whitney to   
		                     
		follow)  
		                 Youíll find us next door when  
		youíre done.  
		                   (off Lombardís  
		furious look: ĎIs that   
		                     
		it?í)  
		                 Huh. We wouldnít want you to  
		go out and   
		                 mug an old lady, would  
		we?  
 
                                                             
		CUT TO:
 
       Lombard is on the phone...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 ... OK, Moreau. Bon, ťcoute,  
		jíai besoin   
		                 díun passport...
 

        
		INT. SPARE BEDROOM, EMILYíS HOUSE. NIGHT.
 
       Lombardís phone calls carry over: 
 
                             
		LOMBARD (VOICE OVER)  
		                 Uh huh... Yes,  
		Jane... Thank you... My   
		                 microwave  
		is still there?... Good. Now   
		                 calm  
		down and listen...
 
       Lombard, in TIGHT PYJAMAS, looking tired, hair wet from a shower,   
		        
		slowly buttons his pyjama top, his eyes idly scanning...  
		       Against a wall: BOXES AND BOXES OF LITERATURE,  
		JOURNALS AND   
		       PAMPHLETS... SOME ARE LABELLED... ĎPAEDIKAí... ĎNAMBLAí...
 
                                 
		EMILY  (OS)  
		                 Nambla - North American  
		Man Boy Love   
		                 Association.
 
        
		Lombard turns... Emily is in the doorway, nods towards the boxes: 
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Fund raising material. Some  
		people will   
		                 only believe what they  
		see... And some   
		                 wonít even believe  
		that. Too decent, I   
		                 guess...
 
        
		Lombard smiles... She looks him up and down, smiling sadly.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 A little too tight, eh?  
		                    
		(off his shrug: ĎTheyíre okay.í)  
		                 ...They  
		were my sonís. Only thirteen and   
		                  
		already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  
		                    
		(she breaks off, smiles nervously)  
		                  
		I... Thereís some cold chicken salad in   
		                  
		the fridge if youíre hungry.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thank you. But I think Iíll  
		go to bed.   
		                 Itís been a long day.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                   (she nods; a beat,  
		then:)  
		                 Right... Well, Iíll get your  
		money first   
		                 thing in the morning,  
		okay?  
		                   (off Lombardís smile:  
		ĎOkayí)  
		                 Okay. Goodnight then.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (smiling kindly  
		rather than warmly)  
		                 Yeah. Goodnight,  
		Emily.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Donít fall asleep with your  
		hair wet.
 
       Alone, Lombard reaches for a booklet from a box...  
		        
		OVER HIS SHOULDER, the booklet in his hands: titled ĎWONDERLANDí,   
		       printed by ĎTHE LEWIS CAROLL  
		COLLECTORíS GUILDí... He leafs   
		       through it... DRAWINGS OF CHILDREN... he pauses...  
		        
		IN ON... ĎTHE FAMILY THAT PLAYS TOGETHER STAYS TOGETHERí.   
		       Lombard tosses it back in its box and  
		peers at a glossy   
		       publication in another:   
		       ĎSEX BY AGE EIGHT  
		- OR ITíS TOO LATEí by THE REN…E GUYON SOCIETY,   
		       Los Angeles, 5,000 members.

       EXT. CENTURY CITY SHOPPING MALL. MORNING.
 
        
		BRIGHT SUNSHINE... A PONTIAC pulls up outside the gleaming mall.   
		       The passenger door swings open...  
		Lombard (still in T-shirt and   
		       sneakers, now with a two-day stubble) climbs out, shuts the door  
		       and leans in the window:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 If the cops get to you, donít  
		get into   
		                 trouble denying you know  
		me. I picked you   
		                 up in a restaurant  
		and you fell for my   
		                 Gaelic charm.  
		You thought I was a   
		                 businessman and  
		had no idea Iíd used your   
		                 address  
		as a mail box. Could you live with   
		                  
		the shame?  
		                   (Emily nods,  
		worried...)  
		                 My money should get here  
		tomorrow. The   
		                 passport might take  
		a little longer. I   
		                 have to send a  
		photograph...
 
       Emily just looks back at him, not knowing what to say.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Well... Iíll be in touch.
 
        
		Lombard turns, squints into the sun, starts towards the crowds of   
		       SHOPPERS...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                   (leaning out the  
		car window)  
		                 What am I to do with the  
		packages if...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he stop, thinks,  
		turns...)  
		                 Burn the passport and keep  
		the money.

       A PHOTO BOOTH.  A soft ĎCLUNKí... A strip of photos drops into the

		Lombard - SHAVED, IN A NEW BLACK SUIT, WHITE SHIRT - looks deadpan   
		       at the four shots of his grim

		The phone booth is on the

		is parked at the end of a small sidestreet OPPOSITE THE HYATT, a   
		       block along from the Mondrian...  
		        
		Lombard stands there, surveying his surroundings, as if this

		EXT. HYATT. DAWN.  A ROADSWEEPER blasts dust off the pavement   
		       around the hotel entrance... 
 
       INT. MUSTANG. DAY.  THE SUN BEATS DOWN.  Lombard, looking rough   
		        
		now, searches the radio - Pop, rap, rock, inane talk, news,   
		       country music - settles for LOUIS  
		ARMSTRONG: ĎAinít Misbehaviní...   
		       He checks his watch - 11:20 - sighs, peers out, lights a Gitane,  
		       reaches for a cup, gulps some cold coffee with a grimace, leans   
		        
		back in his seat, peers out again... stiffens...   
		       Through the windscreen: TWO MEN (dark, ITALIAN-LOOKING,  
		in   
		       immaculate suits) walk away from the Hyattís door...  
		       IN  
		ON Lombard; a frown as he peers at...  Swaying at the end of   
		       one of the menís arms; THE  
		LEATHER TRAVELLING BAG AND HEATHROW   
		       DUTY-FREE BAG FROM FRIEDMANíS ROOM...    
		        
		The men climb into a waiting 4x4 JEEP with tinted windows...  
		       Lombard throws his coffee out the  
		window, puts on his sunglasses,   
		       starts the engine...  THE MUSIC carries over...
 

        
		INT/EXT. TAILING SEQUENCE. DAY. 
 
       EXT.  A road sign: ďSAN BERNARDINOĒ... The Jeep with  
		the Mustang   
		       in tow cruise past...  
		       Now the two cars drive  
		through rich fields with sprinklers...   
		       Another road sign: FREEWAY 215 - Victorville: 30; Barstow:  
		62; Las   
		       Vegas: 216...
 
       INT. MUSTANG.  Ahead, the  
		Jeep changes lane... Lombard peers at a   
		       road sign: ROUTE 395... EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE: 40 miles...  
		        
		EXT.  Scrub and dried-up lakes... a straight road through this   
		       lifeless landscape... A lizard  
		basks in the sun... The Jeep drives   
		       past... then, AFTER WHAT FEELS LIKE AN ETERNITY, the Mustang...  
		        
		INT. MUSTANG.  A frown on Lombardís face as he eyes... A sign   
		       where a track cuts through  
		the HIGH CHAIN-LINK FENCE flashing past   
		       his window...  
		       ďCLOSED  
		TO THE PUBLICĒ  
		       EXT.  The Jeep and Mustang (now separated by another car) cruise   
		        
		along yet more chain-link fencing, stretching forever...  
		       INT. MUSTANG.  Lombard slows...  
		Far ahead, the Jeep takes a   
		       turn...  
		       Lombard slows right down  
		now, peering after... The Jeep, rolling   
		       away along a dusty road into the desert... No fence here,  
		just an   
		       old weatherbeaten sign:   
		       ďCLOSED TO THE PUBLICĒ...  
		        
		Lombard turns to the road ahead... In the far, far distance, on   
		       the other side of the road...  
		A SMALL CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS...
 
                                                      
		END OF SEQUENCE
 

       EXT. GAS STATION/RED MOUNTAIN MOTEL-BAR. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		IN ON a dusty sign: ĎRED MOUNTAIN MOTEL-BARí...  The old PUMP   
		       ATTENDANT fills up the Mustangís  
		tank...  Lombard takes off his   
		       sunglasses... mops his brow, put his dumb face on. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Hot...  
		                    
		(the attendant nods: ĎSure is.í)  
		                 These  
		roads all round here, closed to the   
		                  
		public... Whyís that? Military bases?  
		                    
		(the attendant grunts)  
		                 Huh. I guess  
		thereís space enough for war   
		                 games...  
		Must be good for business.
 
                                  
		ATTENDANT  
		                 Must it?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 All those soldiers out there...  
		getting   
		                 bored, thirsty. Come out  
		here for   
		                 refreshment or female company  
		perhaps?
 
                                  
		ATTENDANT  
		                 Ainít nobody out there,  
		Mister.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Nobody? Huh!... How come?
 
                                  
		ATTENDANT  
		                 Maybe for the same reason  
		that made   
		                 someone somewhere not consider  
		this a spot   
		                 to build the Getty Museum...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Ha-ha... Yeah...  
		                    
		(motioning to where the jeep went)  
		                  
		What about that road back there, though?   
		                  
		It says Ďclosed to the publicí, doesnít   
		                  
		it?
 
                                  
		ATTENDANT  
		                   (scrutinizing  
		Lombard)  
		                 You a tourist?
 
        
		Lombard nods with a grin... The attendant shakes his head, pulls   
		       the nozzle out of the Mustang  
		and hooks it back on the pump.
 
                                  
		ATTENDANT  
		                 Used to lead to a detention  
		camp for   
		                 Japanese Americans, but  
		that was during   
		                 world war two.   
		Whateverís down there now,   
		                 Iím sure  
		it ainít worth a detour...   
		                 Thatíll  
		be 11 dollars and 34 cents.   
		                 Anything  
		else I can do for you, Mister? 
 

       INT. MOTEL BAR. LATE AFTERNOON.
 
        
		A JUKEBOX plays TONY BENNETT...  Lombard, holding a cold beer   
		       bottle to his neck, is at  
		the PAYPHONE by the door, waiting for an   
		       answer, looking out at the desert beyond the parking  
		bay where his   
		       Mustang sits... No answer.  He hangs up, picks up a piece of paper   
		        
		from above the phone, folds it, puts it in his breast pocket,   
		       drains his beer, turns and peers  
		at...  
		       TWO GIRLS (rucksacks, sparkling country eyes, on their way to LA   
		        
		in search of decadence) scribble letters over sodas... 
 

       EXT. DESERT SEQUENCE. DAY/DUSK/NIGHT.
 
        
		THE SIGN: ĎClosed to the Publicí... Lombard, jacket slung over his   
		       shoulder, walks past and onto  
		the track where the jeep pulled   
		       off...    
		       THE SUN BEATS  
		DOWN... Lombard marches on, shirt soaked with sweat.    
		       Now the road narrows to a rough DIRT  
		TRACK over ridges of rock and   
		       sand... Lombard plods on, the only living thing in sight in the  
		       vast sandy landscape...  
		       FOOTPRINTS, clear against tyre marks  
		in the sand...  Lombard,   
		       following the tyre marks past a dried-up river bed...    
		        
		IN ON Lombard; sunburnt, pouring sweat, he stands peering at...    
		       A DERELICT GUARDHOUSE,  
		no door, but a new painted sign:   
		       ĎRESTRICTED AREA. DO NOT PASS BEYOND THIS POINTí...  Lombard  
		wipes   
		       the sweat from his face, sets off again, past it...  
		        
		Now the track climbs a small ridge... Lombard reaches the top,   
		       stops...   
		        
		40 yards ahead, A GATE through a 15ft CHAIN-LINK FENCE topped with   
		       RAZOR WIRE that cuts through  
		the desert.  The gate is shut, fitted   
		       with a SECURITY CAMERA and INTERCOM.  Beyond,  
		the track   
		       continues...  
		       Lombard ducks back beneath the brow  
		of the ridge and...   
		       Reappears 40 yards to the side of the gate, out of camera range...   
		        
		THE FENCE. Lombard eyes the razor wire above... the dry sand   
		       beneath... He gets on his knees  
		and starts digging... IN ON HIS   
		       hands shifting the sand and...
 
        
		DUSK. A MAGNIFICENT SUNSET SKY paints the landscape... We find...  
		       Lombard, covered in sand, is  
		THROUGH THE FENCE, dusting his jacket   
		       off... He puts it on, spits, lights a cigarette... starts  
		for the   
		       next ridge...   
		       IN ON... the burrow under the fence...  
		HUGE; the fence is buried   
		       deep - about 4 feet - and LOMBARD has had to shift a veritable   
		        
		mountain of sand, which now stands outside the fence... 
 
       NIGHT.  AN INKY BLACK SKY  
		PEPPERED WITH STARS... A BRIGHT MOON...   
		       And Lombard, back on the track, marching on, following  
		the tyre   
		       marks still visible in the moonlight...   
		       Now he  
		climbs yet another ridge, reaches its brow, stops...   
		       Below, in a crater-like hollow... AN EERIE  
		SIGHT, light in the   
		       darkness (we hear the distant hum of a GENERATOR and throb of ROCK   
		        
		MUSIC).  
		       Lombard frowns, as if needing time to interpret the sight...
 
        
		A SPRAWLING RANCH within a HIGH PERIMETER FENCE marked with   
		       SPOTLIGHTS.  Light shines from  
		every window of the MAIN BUILDING   
		       which overlooks a courtyard filled with a FLEET OF LUXURY CARS.   
		       Light also shines from the windows of SMALLER BUILDINGS; a HUGE   
		        
		SATELLITE DISH dwarfs one; another, a BARRACKS-LIKE BUILDING, is   
		       FENCED OFF.  Out-buildings  
		- sheds, stables, are in darkness...  
		       Lombard peers along the track... It snakes sharply down to  
		a   
		       brightly lit ENTRY GATE - the only way into the enclosure.  TWO   
		        
		MEN guard it, small figures in army fatigues armed with rifles...  
		       Lombard grips his gun, starts  
		down the slope, away from the   
		       track...  
 

       EXT.  
		THE RANCH. NIGHT.
 
       The Rock Music is loud now...  In the DARKNESS BEHIND A STABLE   
		        
		BUILDING WE FIND... Lombard drags himself through a burrow beneath   
		       the perimeter fence, gets  
		to his feet and peers around the   
		       buildingís corner to....  
		        
		The entry gate: the guards quietly smoke and chat... The main   
		       building 60 or so yards away across  
		a clear expanse: dancing   
		       figures in the open windows...  
		       Gun  
		at the ready, he makes a dash for...  
		         
		       THE MAIN BUILDING (Music  
		very loud now)... He flattens himself   
		       against the wall between two windows, looks inside...  
		        
		A GAMES ROOM: ARMED MEN dance with a dozen TEENAGE GIRLS between   
		       slot machines and gambling tables.   
		The girls are of various races   
		       and types but all are at various stages of PREGNANCY and all look  
		       DOPED.    
		       Lombard moves on, ducks beneath another window  
		giving into the   
		       games room and along to the next...  
		       A BUSY  
		KITCHEN: A UNIFORMED CHEF puts the final touch to a tray of   
		       canapťs in the hands of a NAKED TEENAGE  
		GIRL.  Around them, COOKS,   
		       PORTERS and more NAKED GIRLS busy about with drink trays, etc...  
		        
		IN ON Lombard; a bemused frown... He moves on, around a corner,   
		       stops at another window...   
		       AN EMPTY OFFICE...  We hear A ROAR OF GENERAL LAUGHTER... Lombard   
		        
		turns... It comes from another window... He makes for it...  
		       A HUGE HALL. Cigarette smoke. A CROWD  
		OF ABOUT 30 MEN (suits,   
		       polished shoes) and A HANDFUL OF WOMEN (sharp, executive-type).   
		       From sofas and armchairs scattered around, some accept drinks and   
		        
		canapťs from the trays being offered by more naked teenage girls.    
		       Most faces are turned  
		towards A MAN ON A DAIS (shirtsleeves,   
		       smooth)...
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 ... Okay! So there we  
		are, folks. As our   
		                 Russian friends  
		kindly explained, soon   
		                 even white  
		kids wonít be worth their skin   
		                 now  
		those sons of bitches from Eastern   
		                  
		Europe are flooding the market...
 
                                 
		RUSSIAN MAN  
		                   (bawling in  
		a strong Russian accent)  
		                 Competition  
		is the blood of business. Thus   
		                 spoke  
		the Americans, no?
 
       Mild laughter around the room.
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 Ha ha... Yes. With prices  
		reaching an all   
		                 time low, the name  
		of the game has become   
		                 Ďhave-it-  
		where-itís-atí... As we all   
		                 know,  
		transportation has always been the   
		                  
		costliest and trickiest part of this   
		                  
		business...  
 
                           
		MAN WITH ITALIAN ACCENT  
		                 Cost what?
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 Costliest!
 
                           
		MAN WITH ITALIAN ACCENT  
		                 Whatís that?  
		A word?
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 What do you think?
 
                           
		MAN WITH ITALIAN ACCENT  
		                 I donít know.  
		Could be the sound of   
		                 jewellery hitting  
		a parquet floor, huh?
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 Very funny. Can I go on  
		now?
 
                           
		MAN WITH ITALIAN ACCENT  
		                 Sure. But  
		speak English, will ya, ha ha...
 
       As this is going on, Lombard scrutinizes the faces... -  
		most of   
		       the males are 40- plus, a lot are LATINS, a few clearly look   
		        
		RUSSIAN or EAST-EUROPEAN... 
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 Iíll try... The future,  
		ladies and   
		                 gentlemen, is in doing  
		away with   
		                 transportation. Breeding  
		babies in safe   
		                 houses in the countries  
		where theyíre most   
		                 wanted not only  
		reduces costs... By doing   
		                 away with  
		cross-border smuggling of live   
		                 children  
		and organs it also greatly   
		                 reduces  
		the risks. This pilot-farm weíve   
		                  
		invited you to is now one year old...
 
       IN ON Lombard; he frowns, peering at... ONE OF THE  
		MEN he followed   
		       from the Hyatt; he sits in a corner, listening wearily... Then   
		        
		goes on searching the room (heís looking for Friedman)...
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 ...And let me tell you,  
		in that short   
		                 period both profit  
		margins and demand for   
		                 our products  
		have increased far beyond our   
		                 best  
		forecast. By guaranteeing faster,   
		                  
		cheaper, more reliable delivery, weíve   
		                  
		begun to wipe out the competition. Wordís   
		                  
		getting round. The long term potential is   
		                  
		simply huge. In this country alone on any   
		                  
		one day in excess of 20,000 good folks are   
		                  
		waiting for a replacement organ... Just   
		                  
		multiply five percent of this by say   
		                  
		$10,000 per kidney, $40,000 per heart,   
		                  
		$100,000 per liver, and you might begin to   
		                  
		get the picture...
 
       Now Lombard peers at... THE SECOND MAN from the Hyatt; reclining   
		        
		in a sofa, he observes the bare bottom of a naked waitress...
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 ...Bringing third-world  
		kids to where the   
		                 money is is out-of-date.  
		Trying to beat   
		                 the cops and the clock  
		by smuggling kids   
		                 and parts across  
		borders is at best   
		                 haphazard. Trafficking  
		is yesterdayís   
		                 news, ladies and gentlemen,  
		breeding is   
		                 tomorrowís profits...
 
        
		Lombard moves to another window, hoping for a better view.  
 
                                 
		MAN ON DAIS  
		                 ... A safe house, an in-house  
		doctor or   
		                 surgeon, a hot-line to  
		a carefully   
		                 selected network of doctors,  
		surgeons and   
		                 lawyers, and a few fuckable  
		girls...   
		                   (laughter from  
		his audience)
 
       Lombard moves swiftly away, past the fleet of parked cars to...  
		        
		       THE SATELLITE DISH BUILDING. Through a lit window: computer   
		        
		terminals... A MAN engrossed in a computer game (DOOM)... a   
		       flickering TV (a HOLIDAY PROGRAMME)...  
		Through a dark window: more   
		       computers... TELEPHONES and, through an open door, the man playing  
		       in the next room...  
		       Lombard moves on... creeps around the  
		ranch and through a gate in   
		       the fence enclosing... 
 

        
		EXT. BARRACKS BUILDING, RANCH. NIGHT.
 
       Light behind the curtains of BARRED WINDOWS spaced  
		along the   
		       wall... From inside, SOUNDS OF WOMEN CHATTING, BABIES CRYING...   
		        
		Lombard moves swiftly along the narrow alley between the building   
		       and its fence, searching for  
		a window with open curtains...   
		       A PANTING SOUND... A GROWL somewhere behind him...  He turns...  
		        
		A TOOTHY DOBERMAN looks back at him, ready to pounce, growling...  
		       IN ON Lombard; FEAR, thereís  
		no escape...  Eyeballing the   
		       Doberman, he starts to slip off his jacket, softly hushing  
		the   
		       dog... ĎChut, petit chien...í  
		       He drops gently to his  
		knees, holding his jacket open in front of   
		       him, eyes on the dog...  takes a deep breath,  
		jerks his jacket...    
		       THE DOBERMAN LEAPS, going for the throat...  Lombard catches its  
		       head in his jacket, falls to the ground holding the dog by the   
		        
		neck... The dog thrashes, wrestles... Lombard cracks its skull   
		       through his jacket with his gun  
		butt; once, twice, three times...    
		       The Doberman WHINES... weakens...    
		        
		A SHAFT OF LIGHT SPEARS FROM THE WINDOW ABOVE...  Lombard freezes,   
		       looks up...  The  
		curtain above him is open... Through the bars,   
		       the top half of A YOUNG WOMANís FACE looking out...   
		The Doberman   
		       in Lombardís grip WHIMPERS, shudders violently...  
		        
		IN ON the woman searching the darkness... She flicks the curtain   
		       shut.  
		        
		DARKNESS AGAIN.  Lombard turns to... The main gate: the guards   
		       havenít moved...  The  
		dog: itís dead...    
		       IN ON Lombardís hands peeling the jacket from the dogís head...   
		       his jacket glistens with blood...  He yanks it out from under the   
		        
		dog, sits up, puts it back on, turns to...  The main building: the   
		       pregnant girls are still  
		dancing...   
		       His eyes move to...   
		       Away, against the perimeter  
		fence: a SMALL STONE BUILDING flanked   
		       with STACKS OF OIL DRUMS; it seems to be the source of  
		the   
		       generator hum... Lombard turns back to the main building,   
		        
		thinking...
 

       INT. GENERATOR SHELTER, RANCH. NIGHT.
 
        
		IN ON the roaring GENERATOR lit by...  Lombard stands inside the   
		       door, holding a match,  
		the dead Doberman under one arm, surveying   
		       the small interior...  OIL DRUMS AGAINST THE  
		WALLS...   
		       He dumps the dog...
 

       EXT. THE SATELLITE DISH  
		BUILDING, RANCH. NIGHT.
 
       Lombard looks in window #1... The manís still playing on his   
		        
		computer, the TVís still on... He moves to window #2... Eyes the   
		       phones and, keeping his eyes  
		on the man playing in the next room,   
		       climbs through the window...
 

        
		INT. SATELLITE DISH BUILDING, RANCH. NIGHT.
 
       ...tiptoes to the phones, picks one up, squats  
		to keep the man   
		       next door in sight and starts dialling... He stops, frowning...   
		        
		pulls the paper from his breast pocket... Itís soaked in blood.    
		       He peels it open and, squinting  
		to decipher the numbers, dials...   
		       HE TRAINS HIS GUN ON THE MAN NEXT DOOR... RINGING TONE... Then:  
		       ĎYeah?í
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Get a pen and donít ask any  
		questions.
 
                                 
		EMILY (OS)  
		                 Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Route 395. Past Edwards Air  
		Force base and   
		                 about half a mile  
		before a place called   
		                 the Red Mountain  
		Motel. Thereís a dirt   
		                 track with  
		a ĎClosed to the publicí sign.   
		                 It  
		leads to some kind of ranch in the   
		                  
		middle of nowhere. If you havenít heard   
		                  
		from me by morning send the cavalry, okay?   
		                  
		But not before, you hear?
 
                                 
		EMILY (OS)  
		                 Have you found your man?  
		Is that where he   
		                 is?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I think so. And if it comes  
		to it, tell   
		                 the cops anything you  
		think will make them   
		                 move. Whatever  
		you came up with couldnít   
		                 come close

       And he hangs up, eyes still firmly on the game player. ď...For

       EXT. GENERATOR SHELTER, RANCH. NIGHT.  
		        
		(This building is 60 yards behind the main building, out of view   
		       of the gate.)  
 
        
		Lombard walks backward from the door pouring petrol from a drum...  
		       After 30 yards, he puts the  
		drum down, looks around as he lights a   
		       cigarette... focuses on... A dark SHED, to one side, half-way  
		to   
		       the main building...  
		       He takes a few steps towards the  
		shed, stops, takes a deep drag of   
		       his cigarette, flicks it away...  THE CIGARETTE FLIES  
		THROUGH THE   
		       AIR...   
		       Lombard sprints towards the shed... The  
		cigarette hits the petrol -   
		       WHOOSH...  Lombard reaches the shed...  A RIVER OF FIRE  
		rushes   
		       towards the shelter...  Lombard throws himself to the ground   
		        
		beyond the shed... ĎWHOOMPHí...  Flames engulf the shelter...   
		       Lombard curls up, head in  
		his arms...  
		       BOOM.... The shelter blows up in a deafening conflagration... The   
		        
		MUSIC STOPS, all over the ranch the LIGHTS GO OFF...  
		       Lombard looks up... A ball of fire roars  
		into the night sky...  WE   
		       HEAR SCREAMS...  He turns to...    
		        
		The main building: SEVERAL MEN, guns at the ready, gape at the   
		       fire...  
		        
		Now Lombard again buries his head in his arms...  BOOM...   
		       WHOOMPH... as the petrol drums  
		outside the Generator shelter   
		       blow...  The men outside the main building are thrown to the  
		       ground... WINDOWS SHATTER...  
		       Lombard hurriedly crawls to  
		the door of the...
 

       INT. SHED. NIGHT.
 
       IN ON Lombard  
		as he crawls in; a grimace...  He stops, sniffs the   
		       air, peers into the shed...  In  
		the fire-light coming through the   
		       shattered window: a BATHTUB... BAGS OF LIME... GALLON   
		        
		CONTAINERS...  
		       He goes on in, kicks the door shut, stands, buries his nose in the   
		        
		crook of his elbow and makes for the bathtub...  IN ON Lombard;   
		       sickened eyes...  
		        
		IN THE BATH: the floating remains of A BODY, gruesome, half-  
		       dissolved, face up; could it be Friedman...  
		IN ON Lombard; he   
		       scowls... ĎNom de...í    
		       He turns to...   
		The gallon containers: ĎSULPHURIC ACIDí read the   
		       labels...    
		        
		He glances back at the body, crosses to the window, looks out,   
		       breathing air...    
		        
		Outside:  A strange sight.  A SILENT, 60 STRONG CROWD.  Men in   
		       suits, naked waitresses,  
		pregnant girls, YOUNG MEN IN ARMY   
		       fatigues and jeans, men and women in night-clothes, in servant  
		or   
		       cook uniforms...  A mass of speechless faces all glowing in fire-  
		        
		light, mesmerised by the gigantic flames...   
		       Lombard runs his eyes over the faces...  FINDS...   
		       At the back of the crowd: one of the men he followed from the   
		        
		Hyatt.
 

       EXT. MAIN BUILDING, RANCH. NIGHT.
 
       Lombard  
		runs to the front of the main building... Hurries across   
		       the yard packed with cars... Turns and...
 

       EXT. RANCH. NIGHT.
 
       IN ON the Italian from the  
		Hyatt; hard, dark...   
		       Behind him... Lombard stops, one of the crowd, listening...
 
                      
		MENíS VOICES ABOVE THE FIREíS ROAR  
		                  
		MAN #1: What about back-up? You got back-   
		                  
		up juice?  
		                 MAN #2: Sure, we got a spare  
		generator.   
		                 But it ainít much use  
		without fuel, is it?  
		                 MAN #3: Are you  
		guys saying we got no   
		                 juice?  
		                  
		MAN #4: Who cares, huh! Weíll use candles.   
		                  
		Itíll be romantic.  
		                 MAN #5: Yeah? What  
		kind of romance you got   
		                 in mind,  
		eh? Fuck me in the dark?  
		                 MAN #4: Huh!  
		Fuck you? I wouldnít fuck you   
		                 if  
		I was blind and had a paper bag over my   
		                  
		head.  
		                 MAN #5: Great. Thatís all right  
		then...  
		                 MAN #1: Hey! Can the funny  
		guys shut up?   
		                 Okay. What weíre gonna  
		do is syphon gas   
		                 out the cars to  
		get the spare generator   
		                 going. Frank,  
		John, get to the gate. Pedro   
		                 and  
		Stan, take some men to patrol the   
		                  
		outer fence. If this fireís visible from   
		                  
		the road some assholes might decide to   
		                  
		come this way... Right, everybody,   
		                  
		scatter. And someone see if we got   
		                  
		candles.
 
       The crowd begins to ripple, small clusters form...
 
        
		Lombard jabs his gun into the Italianís back.  Between clenched   
		       teeth:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You make a sound and we both  
		die.  
		                   (the man turns; he  
		jabs him again)  
		                 Letís go.
 
        
		The Italian dithers, glances at Lombardís bloody jacket, frowns...    
		       then grins and shrugs,  
		obviously not giving Lombard much chance...
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Sure. Where to, huh?
 
        
		Lombard jabs the Italian again, steers him towards...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 And keep your head down.
 
        
		WIDE VIEW; Lombard steers the Italian towards THE STABLE BUILDING   
		       behind which he dug his way  
		in, through clusters of slowly moving   
		       people all still too mesmerised with the fire to pay them  
		any   
		       attention...
 

       EXT. STABLE BUILDING, RANCH. NIGHT.
 
        
		Lombard shoves the Italian round the corner, grabs him by the   
		       collar, rams him against the wall,  
		digs the gun into his belly: 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Okay, shitbag. Iím only going  
		to ask you   
		                 this once. Where is Friedman?
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Who?  
		                  
		(off Lombardís black look)  
		                 I donít  
		know who the fuck youíre talking   
		                  
		about, sunshine.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Gluck.
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                   (after a beat,  
		he grins)  
		                 Figlio di puttana. Youíre  
		the French   
		                 asshole who bumped off  
		the London guys...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (slapping him)  
		                  
		Five seconds. Then you die.
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 (his pride hurt, glaring)  
		                  
		Fuck... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 (he slaps him again)  
		                  
		Three...
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 (fighting not to retaliate)  
		                  
		Gluckís dead, you sonofabitch!
 
       IN ON Lombard; dread in his eyes... 
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Youíre the lantern man,  
		huh?  
		                   (as Lombard just  
		goes on staring)  
		                 If you wanna see  
		whatís left of him...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The acid bath?
 
                                
		THE ITALIAN   
		                 Huh! Youíve been around,  
		eh? 
 
       Lombard looks down, dispirited...  He looks up again, eyeballs the   
		        
		Italian, slaps him again and, holding him against the wall, peers   
		       around the corner...   
		       The entry gate: TWO GUARDS, caught in a Jeepís headlights as it   
		        
		leaves... The dazed crowd moving towards the main building...   
		       and...  The barracks building:  
		FRIGHTENED GIRLS gaze out through   
		       the barred windows...  
		       Lombard  
		again eyeballs the Italian - who glares back - quickly   
		       searches him... and thrusts him to the  
		ground by the burrow under   
		       the fence and kicks him.  
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Crawl!
 

        
		EXT. THE DESERT. NIGHT.
 
       In the distance, flames lick the night sky... Across moonlit   
		        
		sands, WE FIND...  
		       Lombard, sombre, his gun arm tensed and ready, trudges a few yards   
		        
		behind the Italian who stares ahead with murderous eyes.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Why did you kill Friedman?
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Let me give you a tip,  
		asshole - no one   
		                 pulls stunts like  
		what you pulled in   
		                 London and here  
		tonight and hopes to get   
		                 away with  
		it. It upsets people. Itís   
		                 wrong.  
		Fucking wrong.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Why did you kill him?
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Huh! You turned him into  
		a liability,   
		                 didnít you know?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Nice way to help a colleague  
		in trouble.
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Thatís just it. The sonofabitch  
		didnít ask   
		                 for help from his colleagues...   
		                   (a beat, then to himself)  
		                  
		Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur   
		                  
		outsiders to fix you... He hasnít gone to   
		                  
		hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr   
		                  
		Lamont!  
 
       IN ON Lombard trudging along; a perplexed frown... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Are you telling me Friedman  
		didnít tell   
		                 you I was here looking  
		for him? 
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 If he had, youíd be dead.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 So why didnít he?
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 What do you think, huh?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I think youíd rather not know  
		what I   
		                 think.
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Huh. Maybe he figured  
		the news our London   
		                 bureau got a  
		visit from a hitman on behalf   
		                 of  
		a pissed off client wouldnít go down   
		                  
		too well. He only shared his guilty secret   
		                  
		last night. And then only Ďcause he was so   
		                  
		fucking edgy after calling his hotel we   
		                  
		persuaded him to talk.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat; more  
		and more intrigued)  
		                 So you killed  
		him and went to clean out   
		                 his hotel  
		room... How did Friedman say he   
		                 got  
		to know where to find me?
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Thatís the beauty. An  
		anonymous call.   
		                 Makes you wonder  
		how many people know what   
		                 youíre  
		up to, eh, French-fuck?
 
       Lombard glares, hurries after the Italian, grabs him by the   
		        
		collar, pulls him close, puts his gun against his head. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Try again, and this time be  
		polite.
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                   (with a snigger)  
		                  
		I can only tell you what he told us... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Not even scum like Friedman  
		would go to   
		                 the trouble of killing  
		a stranger on the   
		                 strength of one  
		anonymous call.
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Some guy called to let  
		him know the   
		                 Frenchman whoíd called  
		the night before he   
		                 left London was  
		in L.A. looking to kill   
		                 him. He did  
		his sums and decided to take   
		                 the  
		call seriously.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What sums?
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Two stiffs and a missing  
		kid followed your   
		                 visit to one of  
		the London hotels. He   
		                 didnít need  
		your confession...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Youíre sure he said his caller  
		was a man?
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Thatís what he said...
 
        
		Lombard, thinking hard, holds him a moment longer, then shoves him   
		       forward... The Italian stumbles,  
		regains his balance, and resumes   
		       walking...
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 When they realise Iím  
		missing...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Shut up and walk...
 

        
		EXT. OUTER PERIMETER FENCE. NIGHT.
 
       The fire is just a distant glow now.  Lombard and  
		the Italian near   
		       the FENCE...  THE ROAR OF AN ENGINE... Lombard turns...    
		        
		In the near distance along the fence; CAR HEADLIGHTS, coming...    
		       Lombard thrusts the Italian  
		down and lies beside him, the gun   
		       pointed right in his face... As the car nears, their faces  
		close,   
		       Lombard and the Italian stare hard at each other... IN ITALIAN: 
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 What you gonna do? Kill  
		me?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Donít tempt me. The last scumbag  
		who   
		                 thought I might kill him died  
		soon   
		                 afterwards.
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Huh. Iím a businessman.  
		What are you, eh?
 
       IN ON Lombard; hatred... IN ON the Italian; hatred...  Lombard   
		        
		looks up... A jeep patrolling the fence rolls past...
 

       EXT. DESERT. DAWN
 
        
		FIRST LIGHT.  Two weary figures plod through the silent sands...
 

       EXT. DESERT/MAIN ROAD.  
		DAWN.
 
       The Italian drags himself over the last sand before the road,   
		        
		stops and peers away to...  Coming up behind, Lombard follows his   
		       gaze... 
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; alarm as he sees... 70 yards away: EMILYíS PONTIAC   
		       near the track entrance...  
		The door opens... Emily climbs out,   
		       looking his way.  
		       Lombard  
		yanks the Italian around, forces him to the ground and,   
		       holding him down, looks back...   
		Emily is trotting towards him...   
		       He shouts:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Get the hell out of here!  
		                    
		(Emily stops in the road)  
		                 Go! Go!  
		                    
		(he waves his gun at her)  
		                 Damn it!  
		Go on, clear off! Wait for me a   
		                 few  
		miles back, all right? Go! Now!
 
       IN ON Emily; she wavers, mutters: ĎShit,í... runs back to  
		her car.  
 
                                 
		THE ITALIAN  
		                 Trouble?
 
        
		Lombard turns, rams the Italianís face in the sand, turns back...   
		       Emily gets into her car, does  
		a U-turn and drives away...  
		         
		       Lombard letís go of the Italian  
		and kicks him angrily...
 

       EXT. RED MOUNTAIN MOTEL. DAWN.
 
        
		Lombardís Ford pulls out of the silent motel forecourt...
 

       EXT. MAIN ROAD, DESERT. DAWN.
 
        
		The Italian lies trussed up with his own tie and belt, in a ditch   
		       near the road, his bare-feet  
		strapped to his wrists behind his   
		       back, socks stuffed into his mouth...   
		        
		The Mustang screeches to a halt... Lombard climbs out, OPENS THE   
		       TRUNK... IN ON the Italian in  
		his ditch; he looks worried now...
 

       INT. MUSTANG. DAWN.
 
        
		THUMP!  Driving fast, muttering unintelligibly between clenched   
		       teeth, Lombard repeatedly  
		smashes his fist into the dash...
 

       EXT. MAIN ROAD, DESERT. DAWN.
 
        
		The Mustang pulls up behind Emilyís Pontiac.  Lombard gets out,   
		       makes for...
 

        
		INT. EMILYíS PONTIAC. DAWN. 
 
       ...slams the door shut behind him, screaming:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Whatís wrong with you, woman!
 
        
		IN ON Emily (she looks tired, has obviously not slept); she   
		       returns Lombardís stare, unperturbed  
		but angry inside... 
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Look, you donít tell me about  
		some   
		                 Godforsaken place where stuff  
		so bad even   
		                 I couldnít imagine it  
		goes down and expect   
		                 me to go quietly  
		to sleep! What happened?   
		                 Whoís the  
		guy? The Austrian?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Whoís the guy? Whoís the guy!  
		Nom de Dieu!  
		                   (he turns  
		away, seething)  
		                 Had the guy got a  
		closer look at you or   
		                 your number  
		plate Iíd have had to kill   
		                 him.
 
        
		Emily frowns, unsure... frightened for a moment...  
		       Lombard glares into her eyes... turns away,  
		taking deep breaths,   
		       calming himself down...  Emily looks him up and down, uneasy, her   
		        
		eyes lingering on... His two-day stubble... His blood-caked   
		       jacket... The GUN in his belt...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Where did you get...  
		                    
		(a beat; she better not...)  
		                 What-what  
		did you find out?
 
       Lombard goes on frowning out the window, exhausted features   
		        
		haunted, AS IF ONLY NOW TAKING IN THE HORROR OF HIS NIGHT...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 What...?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What...  
		                    
		(a beat; he goes on staring out...)  
		                  
		Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant   
		                  
		girls doped up. Babies. Thereís a lot of   
		                  
		people back there. Theyíre holding a   
		                  
		seminar. Traffickingís the past, breeding   
		                  
		the future...
 
       Emily just stares at him, speechless.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Friedmanís dead... They killed  
		him...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                   (not interested  
		in Friedman)  
		                 So who... Whoís the man?  
		Where is he?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Some Italian I picked up back  
		there. Heís   
		                 in the boot of the Mustang.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                   (looking back at  
		the Mustang)  
		                 Italian? The Mafia...?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Who knows. Who cares...  
		                    
		(a beat, he turns to her)  
		                 You wanted  
		slime. You got slime.
 
       SILENCE.  They look at each other, thoughts passing between their  
		       eyes...  She opens her mouth to speak but... Lombard pre-empts   
		        
		her:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No one saw me but the Italian  
		and a dog. I   
		                 blew up their generator.  
		They thought it   
		                 was an accident but  
		by now they must have   
		                 realised one  
		of their party is missing. It   
		                 might  
		make them feel insecure enough to   
		                  
		decide to pack up...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Weíre both thinking the same  
		thing, right?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Do you know a friendly cop?
 
        
		She nods... They look at each other, briefly, 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Call from the motel and tell  
		him if he   
		                 moves fast enough there  
		might be something   
		                 left of a body  
		dissolving in acid.  
		                   (he  
		opens his door)  
		                 Can I have the keys  
		to your house?
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                   (after a beat, understanding)  
		                  
		That-that wonít do. Thatís not the way it   
		                  
		goes. You saw it, you tell it, thatís the   
		                  
		way...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím finished here and Iím  
		tired, Emily.   
		                 You shouldnít be here.  
		Now donít make it   
		                 worse.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 A seminar in a baby breeding  
		farm! Bodies   
		                 in acid! You think Iíll  
		get anywhere with   
		                 that? Jesus! With  
		luck I might raise a   
		                 laugh. They  
		might even send a patrol car   
		                 to check  
		the place out. Whatever, itíll be   
		                  
		too late.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Then find another way. 
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Look! Either you talk or the  
		creeps are   
		                 gonna walk. For godís  
		sake. What am I   
		                 supposed to say?  
		I got this from a French   
		                 guy from  
		England who broke in there to   
		                 have  
		a chat with an Austrian child   
		                 trafficker?  
		Is that it?  
		        
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 Iíll be waiting outside your  
		place.
 
       And he gets out...
 

       EXT. MAIN ROAD. MORNING.
 
        
		...slams the door, makes for the Mustang.  Emily gets out after   
		       him, shouting:
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Damn it! You canít fucking walk  
		away from   
		                 this!
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Itís up to you whether they  
		walk or not.
 
       As he makes his way around the back of her car towards the Mustang   
		        
		driverís door, Emily blocks his way between the two cars.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Me! Me! Do you know who I am,  
		Mr...
 
       Before she can finish Lombard is on her, his hand over her mouth:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Youíre turning into a nuisance,  
		Emily.   
		                 Weíve got company, remember?
 
        
		He looks hard at her.  She frowns, understands, glances at the   
		       Mustang... He holds her a  
		moment longer then lets go.  She goes   
		       on, whispering now... 
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 ...Iím Emily Stewart. The hysterical  
		                 female who sees evil everywhere since  
		the   
		                 day her thirteen year-old boy  
		disappeared.   
		                 The pain in the ass  
		who cries wolf at the   
		                 drop of a hat.  
		However I go about this   
		                 thatís who  
		I am. Do you get what Iím   
		                 fucking  
		saying, Mr Lombard?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What about your friendly cop?
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 My ex-husband. My work drove  
		him away.   
		                 Made his life a misery.  
		He thinks Iím   
		                 obsessed, punishing  
		myself for what   
		                 happened to our son.  
		                    
		(a beat)  
		                 But heís a good guy. Heíll  
		listen to you.   
		                 He wonít turn you  
		in if I ask him not to.   
		                 I can pretty  
		much guarantee that. Okay?
 
       Lombard peers at her, thoughtful, then turns to...  
		        
		       THE QUIET EXPANSE OF DESERT towards the ranch...  
		       IN ON Emily;  
		she waits... IN ON Lombard; he thinks hard... A WAVE   
		       OF SADNESS crosses his face... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I always wanted to come to  
		America... La   
		                 Nouvelle-Orlťans; Baton  
		Rouge; Le Pays   
		                 Cajun... Those were  
		magic names to a Paris   
		                 kid... The  
		far-west, wild and French...
 
       IN ON Emily; What?... IN ON Lombard; he swallows, tight-lipped...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Theyíd never let me go. And  
		youíd end up   
		                 in more trouble than  
		you know for helping   
		                 me.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 You cannot walk away from this.  
		You   
		                 cannot.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I can... The question is,  
		can you lie to   
		                 your ex- husband?
 
        
		IN AND HOLD ON Emily; probing eyes... DISSOLVE AS...    
		       RISING: THE WHIRRING OF A HELICOPTER...  
		continues rising over...
 

       EXT. DESERT. DAY.
 
       A convoy  
		of POLICE CARS charges in a cloud of dust through the   
		       GAPING GATE of the outer perimeter fence...  
		Through the helicopter   
		       whirr WE HEAR:
 
                               
		LOMBARDíS VOICE  
		                 Heíll come. If he  
		ever loved you heíll   
		                 come.   
		You tell him you saw it. You tell   
		                  
		him you went in there. You had to. You got   
		                  
		a letter at the foundation. You had to   
		                  
		check.    
		                   (pause)  
		                  
		Iíll draw you a map... 
 
       Now, A HELICOPTER blots out the blue sky, swoops away towards...
 
                                
		EMILYíS VOICE  
		                 What about the Italian.  
		He knows...
 
                               
		LOMBARDíS VOICE  
		                 Iíll look after the  
		Italian...
 

       INT. POLICE HELICOPTER. DAY.
 
       A DEAFENING  
		WHIRR NOW.  IN ON A ROUGHLY DRAWN MAP OF THE RANCH AND   
		       VICINITY HELD IN A MANíS HAND...  
		        
		Emily sits in the back, behind the PILOT and a police LIEUTENANT   
		       (suit, sunglasses, communication  
		headset, holding the map)...   
		         
		       IN ON Emily, frowning at...  
		        
		In the distance, A PLUME OF SMOKE GENTLY RISES INTO THE SKY...
 

       EXT. RANCH. DAY.
 
        
		SILENCE as we see from above: the ranch in its crater, a WAR   
		       ZONE... Police cars and CLUSTERS  
		OF COPS move slowly around the   
		       CHARRED RUINS of the main building and burnt-out remains of the  
		       wooden outbuildings... Only THE BARRACKS and satellite dish   
		        
		building still stand, blackened but intact, smoke billowing from   
		       their broken windows... 
 

        
		EXT. BARRACKS. DAY.
 
       SILENCE but for... THUMP, THUMP... Emily, the Lieutenant and two   
		        
		COPS stand grimly watching a third COP axing through the barracksí   
		       door...
 

        
		INT. DORMITORY, BARRACKS. DAY.
 
       Shafts of smoky sunlight: BEDS AND BABY-COTS, blackened but  
		still   
		       standing, arranged in military style rows along the length of the   
		        
		room to a badly charred far wall with a GAPING BLACK HOLE in it -   
		       once a doorway. The fire was  
		clearly lit beyond it and never quite   
		       caught in the dormitory.    
		        
		NOW WE SEE... Emily, the Lieutenant and the two cops, just inside,   
		       gazing at the cots and beds...   
		The Lieutenant sends Emily a ĎStay   
		       hereí look and starts down the centre aisle with the other  
		cops in   
		       tow.  
		       We stay with Emily, standing transfixed, watching  
		them head for...   
		       ...The Lieutenant reaches the burnt out door, peers in, steps   
		        
		back, exchanges A HEAVY GLANCE with the other cops, pulls out a   
		       handkerchief, brings it to his  
		mouth and nose and moves on   
		       through, the others in tow...  
		        
		SILENCE.  EMILY IS ALONE... She turns to look at...    
		       A TALL CUPBOARD in the corner  
		of the far wall...  She slowly walks   
		       towards it... PULLS OPEN ITS DOUBLE DOORS...  
		        
		IN ON Emily; a tremor in her cheek, awe in her eyes...  
		       Inside: STACKS OF COLOURFUL PACKS OF BABY  
		NAPPIES...  
		       FOOTSTEPS... Emily starts, turns... The lieutenant, peering grimly   
		        
		ahead, and his cops, emerge from the charred doorway, march past,   
		       not seeing her in her dark  
		corner... Emily watches them go on out,   
		       turns to the charred doorway...
 

        
		INT. INNER HALLWAY, BARRACKS. DAY.
 
       All soot and smoke, three gaping doorways...   
		        
		IN ON Emily; she retches, brings her hand to her nose, turns to...  
		       One of the doorways: through  
		smoke, A BURNT-OUT SURGERY. Debris,   
		       AN OPERATING TABLE, SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, twisted by the  
		heat...  
		       IN ON Emily; horrified, she now peers towards...   
		        
		The open door of a cold-store: a bare foot sticks out from what   
		       COULD BE an entangled mass of  
		CHARRED ADULT BODIES.  WE HEAR a   
		       manís shout:
 
                              
		LIEUTENANT (O.S.)  
		                 Emily!
 
        
		Emily starts, retches, throws up...
 

       INT. BATHROOM, EMILYíS HOUSE. AFTERNOON.
 
        
		Lombardís suit and clothes, washed, hang to dry above the bath...   
		       WE HEAR:
 
                               
		NEWSREADER (OS)  
		                 Acting on a tip-off,  
		police today raided a   
		                 burnt- out

		of...
 

       INT. LOUNGE, EMILYíS HOUSE. AFTERNOON.
 
       IN  
		ON the television set... 
 
                                 
		NEWSREADER  
		                 ... around a dozen bodies  
		near a disused   
		                 military base in a  
		remote area of Barstow   
		                 county. In  
		what is so far believed to have   
		                 been  
		the home of yet another extremist   
		                  
		religious or survivalist cult group, it is   
		                  
		not yet clear what occurred or whether the   
		                  
		deaths are the result of foul play, but   
		                  
		early indications are that the ranch was   
		                  
		deliberatly set alight and the deceased   
		                  
		shot dead before...
 
       Emily, DRUNK, looking awful, slumped on the sofa with a bottle of   
		        
		beer, SWITCHES THE TV OFF with the remote (the room is messy - a   
		       heap of newspapers in a corner,  
		a vacuum cleaner against a wall).
 
       She raises her beer in a toast, slurring...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Hallelujah... Thank God for  
		convenient   
		                 religious nuts...
 
        
		Lombard (in pyjamas), sombre, holding a cup of coffee, sits in the   
		       armchair opposite, eyes on...
 
        
		On the table; a couple of FED-EX packages, A EUROPEAN PASSPORT, A   
		       WAD OF POUND NOTES and a HANDWRITTEN  
		NOTE - we glimpse a girlish   
		       signature: ĎLove, Janeí... 
 
                                   
		WHITNEY  
		                   (standing grimly  
		by the window)  
		                 Weíve still got the  
		Italian...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Thatís right. Whereís the fucking  
		Italian,   
		                 eh, Mr French hero?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (after a beat,  
		scowling at Emily)  
		                 I left him in the  
		Mustang outside a police   
		                 station,  
		with a covering note tying him to   
		                  
		the ranch. Not that heíll talk. 
 
       IN ON Whitney; fear in her eyes as she peers at Lombard...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Of course not. Nothing sticks  
		to slime and   
		                 whatís new, huh?
 
        
		She gulps down more beer, eyeing Lombard, confrontational...   
		       Lombard ignores her, starts counting  
		his money...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Look at him, Whitney. Come all  
		the way   
		                 from England to clean up  
		California. Huh!
 
                                   
		WHITNEY  
		                 Emily...
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 No. Youíre looking at a real  
		Musketeer   
		                 here, Whitney. Brave and  
		rash. Had to dash   
		                 in there.   
		Take a prisoner... Might as   
		                 well  
		have sent them a notice to quit...  
		                    
		(off Lombardís silence)  
		                 Come on, Musketeer!  
		Got anything to say?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  
		                    
		(tossing money towards her)  
		                 This should  
		cover what you lent me.
 
                                    
		EMILY  
		                 Huh! And they say charityís  
		only rewarded   
		                 in Heaven... Hallelujah...  
		                    
		(she drinks, retches, staggers to her   
		                     
		feet)  
		                 Christ...
 
        
		Lombard and Withney watch her stagger out the room... WE HEAR a   
		       door open... A clatter... hear  
		Emily being sick... Then silence...   
		       Whitney sighs, peers at Lombard, who is swallowing coffee  
		and   
		       peering in the passport...
 
                                   
		WHITNEY  
		                 Are you going back home, Mr  
		Lombard?   
		                   (off his look)  
		                  
		Arenít you... Wonít they be looking for   
		                  
		you?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I doubt it. The Italian called  
		me   
		                 Lamont... Whoever tipped off Friedman  
		told   
		                 him I was a hitman called Lamont.
 
        
		Whitney peers at him, not sure she understands... Turns to... The   
		       SOUND OF GLASS SHATTERING in  
		the bathroom...  WE HEAR:
 
                                 
		EMILY (OS)  
		                 Shit! Fuck! Whatís fucking  
		wrong with   
		                 people!  
		                    
		(sound of footsteps)  
		                 Iím going to  
		bed. And sweet dreams to you   
		                 to!  
		                    
		(door slams shut)
 
                                  
		WHITNEY   
		                 Sheíll be alright. Sheís  
		tough... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (a beat, then,  
		grimly:)  
		                 Yeah. The tough ones can  
		only break.
 
       IN ON Whitney; she peers back at him, unsure...  
 
                                                             
		CUT TO:  
		         
		       THROUGH HUSHED SILENCE, THE SOUND OF A TAP RUNNING...  
		The table is   
		       now clear except for a Gitane-stub in a saucer... The sofa   
		        
		empty... Through the open kitchen door: Whitney, glum, washes-up   
		       at the sink...  
		        
		The sound of running water merges into...  
 

       EXT. RIVERSIDE FOOTPATH/FIELD TO RHIANíS  
		COTTAGE. DAY.
 
       THE SOUND OF POURING RAIN, A ROARING RIVER... IN ON a plastic   
		        
		football bouncing with a splash a few times on the grass, rolling,   
		       and...   
		        
		Lombard, standing by the swollen river at the bottom of the field   
		       leading to Rhianís cottage  
		watches the ball come to a stop near   
		       his shoes...  
		       He looks  
		up... Upfield, the Asian boy (gumboots, in a waterproof   
		       much too big for him) stands still, staring  
		at him... HE BOLTS for   
		       the cottage door...
 

       INT. KITCHEN,  
		RHIANíS COTTAGE. DAY.
 
       IN ON a NEWSPAPER ITEM in the ĎNEWS IN BRIEFí COLUMN: 
 
        
		                 ďThe body of Leonard Spitz, 31, was  
		found   
		                 hanging from a tree by a man  
		walking his   
		                 dog north of High Beach  
		in Epping Forest,   
		                 Essex, yesterday.  
		The body was in an   
		                 advanced state  
		of decay. High Beach police   
		                 are treating  
		the death as suicide...Ē
 
       Lombard, standing, peers at ĎThe Guardianí in his hands, checks  
		       its date... NOVEMBER 15 199... then up at...  Rhian standing   
		        
		across the table... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Whatís the date?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 The nineteenth... How come you  
		didnít   
		                 know?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iíve been away.   
		                    
		(a beat, he turns to Rhian)  
		                 Did Leon  
		speak to you about his sister?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Er... Yes...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Did he ever refer to the hostility  
		between   
		                 them?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 He... Apparently the hostility  
		was all   
		                 hers. Leon didnít... It hurt  
		him. They   
		                 used to be close...  
		                    
		(off Lombardís look: ĎIs that so?í)  
		                  
		Their parents were in their forties when   
		                  
		they were born, you see. And mostly away.   
		                  
		They grew up in a Scottish mansion with   
		                  
		old nannies and servants. He... ďOur world   
		                  
		was so old and cold, we shone for one   
		                  
		another,Ē Leon used to say. His sister cut   
		                  
		him off after she got married. He never   
		                  
		understood why but thought it was because   
		                  
		she had no children. Was bitter...
 
       Lombard looks at her, thoughtful, throws the paper down.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The money Leon left for the  
		boy, was it   
		                 cash?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Yes. Three thousand pounds.  
		I still...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Did he mention anything about  
		having an   
		                 exhibition of his work?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 ... No. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You sure? What about before  
		he turned up   
		                 with the boy?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 ... No. In fact, Iíd seen him  
		a couple of   
		                 months earlier. He was  
		quite depressed.   
		                 His work wasnít  
		getting anywhere. He said   
		                 he was  
		going to try something new,   
		                 realism,  
		London in the nineties -   
		                 documentary  
		stuff, you know...
 
       IN ON Lombard; a flicker of thought... Rhian goes on, smiling   
		        
		sadly now.
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 He showed me a book with a picture  
		of a   
		                 couple caught kissing in a street...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Howís the boy doing?
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 Fine...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Good. You neednít worry about  
		the Austrian   
		                 anymore. Heís dead.  
		Iíll be in touch.
 
       And Lombard turns to leave... IN ON Rhian; a quizzical frown... 
 

        
		EXT. LEONíS STREET. AFTERNOON.
 
       Lombardís Triumph, parked outside Leonís apartment building...
 

        
		INT. LIVING ROOM, LEONíS APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.
 
       Lombard stands inside the door, surveying...   
		Leonís life has been   
		       packed away: a heap of boxes in the middle of the floor, the walls   
		        
		and shelves bare...  
		       He makes for the Darkroom door, opens it, switches on the light...  
		        
		       THE DARKROOM: stripped bare... He turns off the light.  
		         
		        
		SITTING ROOM. The boxes now sit scattered around, their contents   
		       littering the carpet; books,  
		records, photographic equipment... WE   
		       FIND...  
		       Lombard, emptying  
		another box - more photographic stuff, prints,   
		       rolls of film, chemicals...  He pulls out  
		A BOX-FILE, opens it...  
		       Inside: CONTACT SHEETS, SHOTS OF LONDON SCENES...  He leafs   
		        
		through, stopping now and then to scrutinize one or the other...    
		       STROLLERS IN PARKS...  
		MORE PARK SCENES...  Finally, he pulls one   
		       sheet out and brings it close to his eyes.  
		        
		IN ON the contact sheet: more park scenes; two strips of shots   
		       follow A TRAMP carrying bulging  
		bags along a park fence with a   
		       busy road beyond...   
		       Lombard  
		scowls, seeing... THREE SEQUENTIAL SHOTS: BEYOND THE   
		       ADVANCING TRAMP, THE FAMILIAR FACADE OF  
		THE DIPLOMAT, its sign   
		       clearly readable, first to the trampís left, then half concealed   
		        
		behind his head, then to his right...  
		       IN ON Lombard glaring at... the strips of shots of the trampís  
		       progress along the fence... HIS FACE STIFFENS AS HE SEES...  A   
		        
		shot of the tramp, now facing the camera, angry, swearing at the   
		       photographer...    
		        
		Lombard brings the sheet even closer, peers hard at it, turns,   
		       scans the floor... picks up a  
		photographerís magnifying block from   
		       the carpet, makes for the window, places the magnifying  
		block on:  
		       THE SWEARING TRAMP THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING BLOCK: to the right of   
		        
		the trampís head, parked cars in a side street; among them, the   
		       distinct contours of an ASTON  
		MARTIN...   
		       Lombard flicks the contact sheet over...   
		                           
		ĎPENRHYNDEUDRAETHí, in his handwriting...  
		       Lombard is livid. ďMerde...Ē
 

        
		INT. OFFICE, LOMBARDíS FLAT. DUSK.
 
       The gold fish swim serenely in their aquarium... Still  
		in his   
		       jacket, smoking, angry, Lombard is at his desk, on the phone:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 ...Je vous remercie, Charles.
 
        
		He hangs up, crosses a name from a long handwritten LIST OF NAMES   
		       AND PHONE NUMBERS - a third  
		are already crossed out - and dials   
		       the number beside the next name - JEAN PROVOST.    
		        
		Waiting for an answer, he stubs out his cigarette, lights another,   
		       blows out smoke and rubs his  
		eyes peering at... the contact sheet   
		       on his desk.  THE SOUND OF A KEY IN THE LOCK...   
		Lombard   
		       stiffens...
 
       The door opens... Jane stands in  
		the doorway holding a white   
		       bundle - A BABY.  She beams, comes in...
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Savieer! Youíre back! 
 
        
		Lombard sends her a stony smile, signals her to be quiet...  Jane   
		       quickly murmurs something  
		to a young man who has appeared beside   
		       her - TIM - then calls in a whisper:
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 I came to feed your fish. I didnít  
		know...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (signalling her  
		to shut up again)  
		                 Oui, bonjour, Jean...  
		Oui, trŤs bien,   
		                 merci. Dites-moi,  
		pourriez-vous me dire si   
		                 vous avez  
		recommandťmes services   
		                 ŗquelquíun  
		rťcemment... Vous Ítes   
		                 certain...  
		Non, non...  Je vous   
		                 remercie...  
		                    
		(hangs up, crosses out Provostís   
		                     
		name...)
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Hello there. Howís the flat.  
		I cleaned...
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 Jane, there was an envelope  
		in my desk.   
		                 The one Iíd given you  
		and then got back,   
		                 remember? I canít  
		find it. Do you know   
		                 where it is?
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                   (she stares, thrown  
		by his briskness,   
		                     
		then:)  
		                 No... I told you on the phone.  
		Whoever   
		                 broke in messed-up all your  
		papers. I put   
		                 everything back where  
		I thought it ought   
		                 to be.  
		                    
		(nodding to a pile of papers)  
		                 Maybe  
		itís there with...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Itís not.
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Well, Iím sorry. I...  
		                    
		(a cry from the baby in her arms; she   
		                     
		smiles at it, then at Lombard)  
		                 This  
		is my nephew... And my brother, Tim.   
		                  
		Iíve got the week off and heís come to   
		                  
		stay.
 
       Tim waves a hand, mutters ĎHelloí, Lombard ignores him, staring   
		        
		instead at the baby in Janeís arms... Jane sends him a nervous   
		       smile now...
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Anyway. You see, your lockís  
		fine. I donít   
		                 know how they got in.  
		So, how was L.A.,   
		                 eh?
 
        
		Lombard just goes on eyeing the baby... Jane looks more and more   
		       uneasy. 
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 I-Iím sorry about your envelope,  
		okay?
 
       Now he glances quickly at her, then back at his list, saying:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thank you, Jane. Iím busy.
 
       And he starts dialing...  FLUSTERED, Jane retreats to the doorway,   
		        
		where Tim is already moving away.
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Well, excuse me!
 
        
		She slams the door behind her... Waiting for his call to be   
		       answered, Lombard once again peers  
		at THE CONTACT SHEET...  A   
		       FROWN... He looks up...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No children...
 
        
		He slams the phone down, thinks hard... eyes the contact sheet   
		       again, dials again...
 
                                 
		BUTLER (OS)  
		                 Good afternoon. De Moraesís  
		residence.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Could I speak to Carlos or  
		Deborah?
 
                                 
		BUTLER (OS)  
		                 Iím afraid they are out  
		at the moment,   
		                 sir.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 When will they be back?
 
                                 
		BUTLER (OS)  
		                 Mr De Moraes is due back  
		from Brazil late   
		                 this evening. Mrs  
		De Moraes is out and not   
		                 expected  
		before eight. Do you wish...
 
       Lombard hangs up, thinks hard again... checks his watch: 18:35...
 

        
		INT. LANDING, LOMBARDíS FLAT. DUSK.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (calling up from  
		his doorway)  
		                 Jane!  
		                    
		(no reply; he moves to the stairs)  
		                  
		Come on, Jane!
 
       We hear A DOOR OPENING, then a shout:
 
                                  
		JANE (OS)  
		                 Piss off!
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he frowns, then:)  
		                  
		Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my   
		                  
		money, all right?... Come on, I need you.   
		                  
		Itís important. 
 
       Silence. Lombard waits... SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS UPSTAIRS...
 

        
		INT. OFFICE, LOMBARDíS FLAT. DUSK.
 
       Lombard puts on his coat talking to Jane who stands at  
		his desk   
		       eyeing his list...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Just ask if they can recall  
		recommending   
		                 my services to anyone  
		in the recent past.   
		                 Say youíre my  
		secretary, all right?
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                 Your secretary, huh!
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (picks up the  
		contact sheet, walks   
		                     
		away)  
		                 Iíd appreciate it if you could  
		do this for   
		                 me. If you canít, donít  
		worry about it.   
		                 Iíll call in about  
		an hour anyway. Sorry   
		                 but Iím in  
		a hurry.  
		                   (he steps out  
		the door)
 
                                    
		JANE  
		                   (alone, shouting  
		after him in   
		                    frustration)  
		                  
		What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean,   
		                  
		not this but... Money, passports, a gun in   
		                  
		a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
 

       EXT/INT. REDDINGTON ROAD, HAMPSTEAD/TRIUMPH.  
		DUSK.
 
       EXT.  TWILIGHT. HEAVY RAIN. THE PURR OF AN IDLING CAR ENGINE... A   
		        
		cigarette hits the wet tarmac with a spray of sparks...  
		       INT. STATIONARY TRIUMPH.  Lombard  
		peers out through his swishing   
		       wipers at... THE DE MORAESí MANSION... NO CARS IN THE DRIVE...  
		He   
		       checks his watch... 19:10...  
 

       EXT. DE MORAESí  
		MANSION DRIVEWAY. DUSK.
 
       The Triumph crunches across the gravel into the empty drive... CUT  
		       TO:  
		       The butler stands in the doorway, frowning at... Lombard,  
		climbing   
		       the steps with a tired grin... 
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                 Good afternoon, Mr Lombard.  
		Iím afraid...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I know, Laurence. Your Mistress  
		isnít   
		                 expecting me Ďtill eight. But  
		as I was in   
		                 the area I thought I  
		might as well wait.
 
       And he pushes his way in past the butler,...
 

        
		INT. HALLWAY, DE MORAES MANSION. DUSK.
 
       ...wipes his feet on the mat, makes for the drawing  
		room and stops   
		       as the butler reluctantly closes the front door...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 By the way, Laurence, were  
		you here last   
		                 time your mistressís  
		brother came over?   
		                 You know, just  
		before he disappeared?
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                   (heading stiffly  
		for the drawing room)  
		                 I work here,  
		sir. Iím here most of the   
		                 time.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (following the  
		butler)  
		                 You wouldnít recall if the  
		brothers-in-law   
		                 left together, would  
		you?
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                 You will have to ask Mr De  
		Moraes that,   
		                 sir.  
		                    
		(opens the drawing room door, steps   
		                     
		aside)  
		                 Would you like a drink while  
		you wait?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 No. Thank you. Iíll be fine...
 
        
		And Lombard steps into the...
 

       INT. DRAWING ROOM, DE MORAES MANSION. DUSK.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Mrs De Moraes must have taken  
		it hard, eh?  
		                   (off the  
		butlerís blank look)  
		                 Her brotherís  
		death.
 
                                   
		BUTLER  
		                 Dial O-O-O on the telephone  
		if you change   
		                 your mind about the  
		drink, sir.
 
       And the butler shuts the door... Lombard puts his ear to the door   
		        
		... FOOTSTEPS LEAVING... carefully opens the door...  
		       The hall is empty, distant sounds of kitchen  
		activity from a   
		       corridor...
 

       INT. HALLWAY/STAIRWELL.  
		DUSK.
 
       Lombard hurries across the hall and up the curving carpeted   
		        
		stairway to...
 

       INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR. DUSK.
 
        
		Moving fast, he barely pauses as he opens and peers into the doors   
		       along his way, turning the  
		lights on and off, searching for...  
		       Now he turns on the light in yet another room... goes in...
 

        
		INT. DEBORAHíS BEDROOM. DUSK.
 
       ...Carefully closes the door behind him, surveying...  
		        
		A feminine bedroom (RED PREDOMINATES): fourposter bed, dressing   
		       table, a Constable landscape,  
		an oil portrait of Deborah,   
		       majestic; two doors...  
		       Lombard  
		opens one: A MARBLE BATHROOM...  The other: a masculine   
		       bedroom (pastel colours, modern,  
		spacious) - CARLOSíS BEDROOM...   
		       Now he searches Deborahís bedside table drawer (Marlboro packs,  
		       ear plugs, tissues, sleeping pills, etc.)...   
		       Rifles through  
		the drawers of the dressing table covered with   
		       expensive cosmetics; in the drawers, more cosmetics;  
		one contains   
		       nothing but LIPSTICKS (ALL THE SHADES OF RED), another jewellery..    
		        
		Steps into a WALK-IN CLOSET: fur coats, suits, lots of shoes...   
		       Opens the wardrobe: a lot of  
		seductive LINGERIE, SOME STILL WITH   
		       PRICE TAGS, NEVER WORN... IN ON Lombard; an intrigued frown.
 

       INT. EN-SUITE BATHROOM. DUSK.
 
       Lombard scans the  
		contents of the medecine cabinet: the usual   
		       household medecines, plus TEMAZEPAM... NITRAZEPAM...  
		VALIUM...  
		       Now he opens and closes the drawers of a dresser... One, two,   
		        
		three... He keeps the last one open, focusing inside...  
		       Boxes of tampons and panty liners... 
 

        
		INT. DRAWING ROOM, DE MORAES MANSION. DUSK.
 
       Lombard is at the phone, dialling...  A  
		ring then: ĎHalloí.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Hello, Jane. Itís me.
 
                                  
		JANE (OS)  
		                 Really? And how are you,  
		eh?   
		                   (Lombard sighs, waiting...)  
		                  
		Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a   
		                  
		month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian   
		                  
		friend of...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Carlos De Moraes?
 
                                  
		JANE (OS)  
		                 Yes. How did...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Thank you, Jane.
 
        
		He hangs up, stares thoughtfully in front of him for a moment,   
		       drawn and dispirited, all of a  
		sudden looking VERY, VERY TIRED...    
		       He turns to...  
		         
		        
		THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE TRIUMPHANT CARLOS ON THE WALL...
 

       EXT. DE MORAES DRIVEWAY. EVENING.
 
        
		Deborahís Aston Martin pulls up beside the Triumph...
 

       INT. DRAWING ROOM, DE MORAES MANSION.  
		EVENING.
 
       Lombard sits placidly peering ahead, his back to... Through the   
		        
		window: the butler escorts Deborah from her car, sheltering her   
		       with his umbrella, talking...  
		        
		HOLD ON Lombard, expressionless as... WE HEAR the front door   
		       close, heels move quickly across  
		the hall... The door opening...  
		       IN ON Lombard; a stony grin... Deborah stands stiffly in the   
		        
		doorway, in black, wearing sunglasses, with a new hairstyle (A   
		       FRINGE covers most of her forehead),  
		holding a handbag and a   
		       HARRODS SHOPPING BAG...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Mr Lombard...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 When did you get back?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Why donít you ask when I left  
		the   
		                 Mondrian?
 
        
		She hesitates... steps in, makes for the table and... keeping her   
		       back to Lombard, reaches for  
		her cigarettes, doing her utmost to   
		       sound calm:
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I was going to phone you.  
		We...  
		                   (a beat as she lights  
		her cigarette)  
		                 Leon is dead. He hung  
		himself... They   
		                 found him in Epping  
		Forest... Five days   
		                 ago...
 
        
		Lombard stays silent...  She turns to face him, sends him a   
		       nervous grin, sits at the table  
		and starts searching her handbag   
		       with jerky movements...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I canít say it came as much  
		surprise.   
		                 Still...  
		                    
		(she seems lost for words)  
		                 Iím sorry  
		no one called you. You must have   
		                  
		come for your money. How much do we owe   
		                  
		you?
 
       She pulls a cheque book and pen from her bag, opens the cheque   
		        
		book, looks up at Lombard... He just looks at her, coldly.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Iím really sorry you were  
		not called...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Youíre repeating yourself,  
		Mrs De Moraes.
 
                                  
		DEBORAH    
		                 I... Well, weíre burying  
		Leon tomorrow   
		                 and... Look, I wish  
		I had more time, but   
		                 itís late and  
		with the funeral...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (dark grin)  
		                  
		Arenít you curious to know about Friedman?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I... If you donít mind, I  
		do not think he   
		                 matters now. It...  
		Things turned out to be   
		                 as we thought;  
		Leon was weak. Thereís no   
		                 point in  
		delving into his sad life   
		                 anymore.  
		Now, will you please tell me how   
		                  
		much we owe you?
 
       IN ON Lombard; a cruel glimmer as he peers at... The pen in her   
		        
		hand: sheís so tense sheís burying its tip in the cheque book...   
		       He looks up again...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Black suits you.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Sorry?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (signalling towards  
		the Harrods bag)  
		                 Whatís in the bag?  
		Underwear? To seduce   
		                 your husband?  
		Or is it for your own   
		                 recreation?  
		                   (off her mystified silence)  
		                  
		Tell me, how come such a handsome couple   
		                  
		sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because   
		                  
		he does it with little children?
 
       He glances at... she holds the pen so tight her fingers  
		have gone   
		       white... He looks up, giving her no time...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Or is it the other way round?  
		The children   
		                 are needed because you  
		canít satisfy him?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 You... You are out of order,  
		Mr Lombard.   
		                 I...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (jumping to his  
		feet, SHOUTING)  
		                 You what, Mrs De Moraes?  
		YOU WHAT?
 
       She just sits, startled... He glares at her, calms himself down...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 How did you break into my  
		office, Deborah?   
		                 Ladies of your standing  
		donít learn to   
		                 pick locks between  
		shopping trips.  
		                   (off her  
		startled silence)  
		                 Come on, Deborah!  
		Acting dumb doesnít suit   
		                 you! Who  
		knew Iíd found dirt on your   
		                 brother,  
		huh? Who knew it was in an   
		                 envelope?  
		Taking me for dead, whoíd want   
		                 to  
		make sure it didnít fall into the wrong   
		                  
		hands?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Youíre mad...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iíve had a long and unpleasant  
		day. Iím   
		                 tired and Iím angry. But  
		mad? Not yet.  
		                   (a beat)  
		                  
		I paid Leonís boy a visit this morning.   
		                  
		Found him alive and well. Why havenít you   
		                  
		told your husband where he is since   
		                  
		reading my note, eh?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Why... I donít know what youíre  
		talking   
		                 about.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You know heíd have had him  
		killed, donít   
		                 you? Does a conscience  
		still burn   
		                 somewhere inside your  
		sore mind, Deborah?   
		                 Or is it just  
		cold expediency? Could the   
		                 boy perhaps  
		come in useful when and if the   
		                 day  
		ever comes for you to face up to the   
		                  
		man you married?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Have you finished?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 When did you learn about his  
		taste for   
		                 kids, huh? On your honeymoon?  
		Or was it   
		                 later, when bitterness  
		set in and you   
		                 turned against your  
		beloved but weak   
		                 little brother?  
		How did you find out? Did   
		                 he confess?  
		Try to convert you perhaps? Or   
		                 was  
		it womanís intuition? Or just the way   
		                  
		he fucked you?
 
       Deborah whips off her glasses - ONE OF HER EYES IS BRUISED...  She   
		        
		says, haughtily, too haughtily:
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 You do have a vivid imagination,  
		Mr   
		                 Lombard. I only wish youíd use  
		it   
		                 fruitfully instead of in being  
		obnoxious.   
		                 I fail to understand your  
		purpose in this.   
		                 Still, say what  
		youíre owed if you still   
		                 wish to  
		be paid or get out, all right?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (peering at her  
		bruised eye)  
		                 I guess the news youíd  
		sent me after   
		                 Friedman didnít go  
		down too well, eh?
 
       She glares... replaces her cheque book and pen in her bag.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Why did you send me after  
		Friedman,   
		                 Deborah? 
 
        
		She stubs out her cigarette, RISES TO HER FEET.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Whatever the reason, Iím sorry  
		I did.   
		                 Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe  
		you know   
		                 your way out.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You knew he had nothing to  
		do with your   
		                 brotherís disappearance,  
		didnít you?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Huh! Donít you recall convincing  
		me he   
		                 had?  You should learn  
		to live with your   
		                 mistakes, Mr Lombard.  
		There is some merit   
		                 in it.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I take it you learnt to live  
		with yours   
		                 then. Take it all the  
		mind-dulling pills   
		                 in your medicine  
		cabinet are surplus to   
		                 your well-being... 
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 How... When did you...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 It must be tough being married  
		to Adonis   
		                 to end up sleeping alone  
		every night.   
		                 Sleep must be hard coming.  
		Whatís harder?   
		                 The thought of the  
		fine litter you two   
		                 could have bred  
		if? Or imagining what he   
		                 does with  
		his children?
 
       IN ON Deborah; HATRED in her eyes. Her lip twitches, she opens her   
		        
		mouth to speak... but holds back...   
		       SILENCE. They eyeball each other, Deborah filled with scorn,  
		       Lombard with disgust... She takes a deep breath...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 What exactly did you come  
		here for, Mr   
		                 Lombard?
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; a frown of disbelief... He shakes his head, pulls   
		       the contact sheet from his pocket,  
		makes for her unfolding it,   
		       flattens it on the table, turns it round, pushes it towards her:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What were you satisfying?  
		Morbid   
		                 curiosity? Was it gratifying?
 
        
		She stares at the contact sheet... Looks up, mystified.... He puts   
		       his finger onto the shot with  
		the Aston Martin...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Look closely, Deborah! How  
		many Aston   
		                 Martin DB6 do you think  
		there are in   
		                 London, huh?
 
        
		IN ON Deborah; DREAD IN HER EYES... She looks down again...   
		       Lombard takes a couple of steps back  
		to watch her peer at the   
		       shot, searching...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Tell me, did he kill his little  
		victims   
		                 too?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 No!
 
        
		SILENCE.  She looks towards him but not at him... Lombard snarls,   
		       watching her realise she  
		has slipped...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What do you mean, ĎNoí, Mrs  
		De Moraes?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 My brother hung himself.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Does the name Pierre Dreyer  
		mean anything   
		                 to you? Heís a client  
		of mine and a friend   
		                 of your husband.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Leon hung himself.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Adonis thought your brotherís  
		bodyíd be   
		                 found reasonably quickly  
		when he hung it   
		                 in Epping Forest,  
		didnít he? Seemed like a   
		                 good idea.  
		An ex-junkie, obsessed with   
		                 death;  
		the perfect candidate for suicide.   
		                  
		He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers   
		                  
		are rare during your average blustery   
		                  
		English November. An Englishman might have   
		                  
		thought of that, but a Brazilian... 
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Leon hung himself...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Leonís not found, your parents  
		worry, talk   
		                 of hiring help to find  
		him, even mention   
		                 their manhunter  
		friends perhaps... and   
		                 Adonis panics,  
		takes control, brings me in   
		                 reckoning  
		a small- time detective is   
		                 unlikely  
		to dig up anything awkward, not   
		                 before  
		Leonís found anyhow. He must have   
		                  
		kicked himself when he learned Iíd   
		                  
		exceeded his expectations.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Leon hung himself...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Leon didnít hang himself,  
		Deborah. Your   
		                 husband killed him  
		and made his death look   
		                 like suicide.  
		How did he do it, eh?   
		                 Strangulation?  
		Drugs? No doubt an autopsy   
		                 will tell.
 
        
		IN ON Deborah; FEAR... 
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Maybe... If Leon didnít hang  
		himself,   
		                 maybe Friedman killed him.  
		Maybe Friedman   
		                 has your envelope....
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; amazement... She canít help fighting. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I doubt Friedman ever even  
		met Leon,   
		                 Deborah. Friedman dealt  
		with select   
		                 customers. As for my  
		envelope, had he know   
		                 where it was  
		he wouldnít have mistaken me   
		                 for  
		a hitman called Lamont when we met in   
		                  
		Los Angeles.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 ...You-you spoke to him?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Not in the strict sense of  
		the word, no.   
		                 He was in too much  
		of a hurry to kill me   
		                 when we first  
		met and too wasted in acid   
		                 when I  
		caught up with him later.
 
       SILENCE. Deborah sends him a long look... IN ON her; a flicker  
		of   
		       relief... IN ON Lombard; he scowls, understanding...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Yes. Youíre safe. He swallowed  
		the bait   
		                 and paid for it by dying.  
		Was the hitman   
		                 story your idea or  
		Adonisís, huh?  
		                   (off Deborahís  
		silence)  
		                 What was the trouble? Friedman  
		might have   
		                 told me he didnít know  
		your brother? I   
		                 might have told him  
		who I worked for...?
 
       SILENCE... Deborah stares at him, expressionless. 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Your brother stumbled upon  
		Adonisís little   
		                 secret, didnít he?  
		And traded his silence   
		                 for a kid  
		and some cash. And Adonis fell   
		                 for  
		it, bought him his kid, sent him away,   
		                  
		and then killed him when he came back for   
		                  
		more.  
		                   (a beat)  
		                  
		Leon didnít come here to borrow money for   
		                  
		prints. He came to extort a second kidís   
		                  
		life. Your flunkey let him in, so his   
		                  
		visit couldnít be concealed, hence the   
		                  
		exhibition story. There was no exhibition.   
		                  
		Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah?   
		                  
		ďLeon does his own prints. Wouldnít want   
		                  
		anyone to interfere with his ĎArtíĒ.   
		                    
		(off her silence)  
		                 I should have paid  
		more attention to your   
		                 words. Perhaps  
		itís the way you say   
		                 them...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                   (turning to the  
		contact sheet)  
		                 If-if my car is there,  
		I could be the one   
		                 who... Why donít  
		you accuse me of killing   
		                 my brother?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Kids are not your thing, Deborah.  
		Youíd   
		                 have been ready for me when  
		I turned up   
		                 with ĎSleeping Beautyí.  
		Damn it! Then too   
		                 I should have paid  
		more attention. ďNot   
		                 Leon,Ē you said.  
		It struck me at the time,   
		                 but obviously  
		not hard enough. You didnít   
		                 say ĎMy  
		God!í, or whatever else well-bred   
		                  
		ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry   
		                  
		misbehaved. ďNot Leon.Ē Who then?  
		                    
		(a beat)  
		                 You sure were right about  
		one thing,   
		                 Deborah, the job was too  
		formidable for   
		                 me. I should have  
		thought a little more   
		                 before I left  
		for Los Angeles. But there I   
		                 was  
		focused so hard on Friedman Iíd   
		                 stopped  
		thinking. Nothing added up - Leon   
		                  
		soliciting money for prints while buying   
		                  
		kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the   
		                  
		world of child traffickers; duping   
		                  
		Friedman into selling him a little boy...   
		                  
		You sure were right. The job was too   
		                  
		formidable for me. But you knew that,   
		                  
		didnít you?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Leon could still have hung  
		himself.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Oh no. At long last Leon had  
		found a   
		                 mission. Heíd never have  
		killed himself   
		                 when glory beckoned.  
		Your husband killed   
		                 your brother.  
		And thanks to you, almost   
		                 got me  
		killed too.
 
       SILENCE. Deborah stares at him... and... as if suddenly drained,   
		        
		falls back in her chair... She lights a cigarette with a trembling   
		       hand, takes a deep drag...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Poor Leon... How typical of  
		him to be in   
		                 the wrong place at the  
		wrong time...  
		                   (a beat)  
		                  
		When I called you in Los Angeles... I   
		                  
		wanted to warn you. Maybe I would have if   
		                  
		you hadnít left me waiting on the line. I   
		                  
		hung up...
 
       IN ON Deborah; tears well up her eyes...  IN ON Lombard; a cold,   
		        
		mean spark deep in his eyes... IN ON Deborah; she goes on looking   
		       up at him, resolute...  
		        
		Lombard pushes his hands deep into his pockets, turns, makes for   
		       the window, and says, staring  
		into the darkness outside:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Donít cry. I might become  
		nasty...
 
       Deborah eyes him through tearful eyes... then turns to the contact   
		        
		sheet: 
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Youíre wrong about my being  
		there, though.   
		                 Carlos borrowed my  
		car that day, his had   
		                 broken down...  
		                    
		(a beat, she wipes away a tear)  
		                 Leon  
		saw it, like you, assumed I was   
		                 there,  
		thought heíd wait to ask for a   
		                 lift.  
		But Carlos turned up, with the tape   
		                  
		you found...  
		                   (she wipes  
		away another tear)  
		                 Leon got his lift,  
		and accidentally picked   
		                 up the tape  
		with his photo equipment when   
		                 he  
		got out. He watched it, confronted   
		                  
		Carlos, threatened to tell the police   
		                  
		about the hotel... I donít know how he   
		                  
		knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos   
		                  
		talked too much... My husband did not tell   
		                  
		me... You more or less guessed the rest...  
		                    
		(looks up, peers hard at Lombardís   
		                     
		back)  
		                 I didnít know any of this before  
		you left   
		                 for Los Angeles.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (keeping his back  
		to her)  
		                 You donít say.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 That my brother, my husband  
		and your Mr   
		                 Friedman were linked,  
		that much I had   
		                 guessed. But that  
		my husband had killed   
		                 Leon? No.
 
        
		IN ON Lombard; he could kill her... but keeps his back to her... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Why did you send me after  
		Friedman? To   
		                 atone for your sins?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I didnít know my husband and  
		Friedman knew   
		                 each other. I just...  
		                    
		(off his silent back)  
		                 Do you think  
		we spoke about it? Iíve known   
		                 for  
		five years. Heís known Iíve known for   
		                  
		five years... But not once have we spoken   
		                  
		about it. There are things one just   
		                  
		doesnít speak about...
 
                                  
		LOMBARD    
		                   (turning  
		to her, sickened)  
		                 One just doesnít...  
		Tell me, what does one   
		                 speak about,  
		huh?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Think what you like. But donít  
		presume to   
		                 understand.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I donít.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Good.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Is there anything to understand?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Why do I feel I neednít answer  
		that?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Rich. Young. Beautiful. You  
		must at least   
		                 get a kick out of what  
		he does to his   
		                 kids.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 You bastard...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Five years of it. Surely,  
		youíd have   
		                 divorced him if he disgusted  
		you?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 You splendid bastard...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Are there truly no extenuating  
		                 circumstances?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 ...Weíre turning in circles.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 And you still havenít told  
		me why you sent   
		                 me after Friedman.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Maybe I wanted to give my  
		husband a   
		                 fright.
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 A fright?... Five years of  
		cowardice led   
		                 to your brother being  
		murdered and you   
		                 wanted to give his  
		murderer a fright?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I didnít know who or what  
		had happened to   
		                 my brother yet, Mr  
		Lombard!
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What was the idea? Husband  
		is filled with   
		                 fear when he learns  
		his child supplierís   
		                 being tailed?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Something like that.
 
                                  
		LOMBARD   
		                 Something like that?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Something like that.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What happened? Adonis slapped  
		you about a   
		                 little and you reverted  
		to cowardice?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Here we go again.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Where is that?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Simplify and damn.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Donít you believe in simplicity?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Should I?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 We all have to like what we  
		become.   
		                 Cowards included. We achieve  
		this by   
		                 complicating things a little.  
		But itís   
		                 never that complicated really.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 You seem to know what youíre  
		talking   
		                 about.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Perhaps it came to me while  
		dying in a   
		                 Californian desert because  
		a woman set   
		                 upon giving her husband  
		a fright got   
		                 slapped about a little.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 My husband didnít need to  
		slap me about,   
		                 Mr Lombard. I volunteered... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 To get me killed...?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I didnít intend it that way...  
		It just   
		                 happened.  
		                    
		(off his look: ĎJust happened...?í)  
		                  
		He heard from Laurence that youíd been   
		                  
		back.  That weíd argued. He asked why and   
		                  
		it just happened; I told him everything...   
		                  
		I couldnít help it. Wanted to see him   
		                  
		scared. I had never seen him scared   
		                  
		before, you see...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Perhaps I did... Until fear  
		turned into   
		                 panic. Thatís when he  
		hit me, and told me   
		                 heíd killed my  
		brother... ďYou donít know   
		                 what youíve  
		done,Ē he said.  ďWeíre in   
		                 deep  
		trouble,Ē he said. ďWe,Ē he said.   
		                  
		ďWe.Ē  
		                   (a beat as she sneers)  
		                  
		Weíd both be killed if Friedman ever found   
		                  
		out you were working for us, he said. We   
		                  
		had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
 
       IN ON Lombard; sickened... She sends him a proud,  
		contemptuous   
		       glance...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Fear is contagious. I donít  
		know if you   
		                 can or want to understand,  
		but I didnít   
		                 want to die because  
		of what heíd done...   
		                 It was you or  
		us...
 
       SILENCE.  They stare at each other... She finally says, somewhat   
		        
		menacingly: 
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Well, now you know, what do  
		you propose we   
		                 do, eh, Mr Lombard?  
		                    
		(off Lombard look of incredulity)  
		                  
		My brother and Friedman are dead.  
		                    
		(nodding towards the contact sheet)  
		                  
		That proves nothing. Indeed, you have no   
		                  
		proof of anything. And even if you did,   
		                  
		you wouldnít really go to the police,   
		                  
		would you, Inspecteur Laurent Delfosse?
 
       IN ON Lombard; his eyes darken...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 The real Xavier Lombard died  
		six years ago   
		                 in a car accident in  
		Southern France... As   
		                 you know we  
		have friends. We asked them to   
		                 do  
		some research, for just such a   
		                 contingency  
		as this.  
		                   (a beat)  
		                  
		You could have been more imaginative in   
		                  
		your choice of a new profession.   
		                  
		Especially since you made the front page   
		                  
		for shooting dead a convict in a prison   
		                  
		waiting room. 
 
       She eyeballs him... Lombard scowls, then grins, a sickened grin.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 You know something? Iíve just  
		seen so much   
		                 ugliness I donít think  
		Iíd mind four walls   
		                 and dinner served  
		every night at a regular   
		                 time.  
		                    
		(he turns and makes for the phone)  
		                  
		Iíd hoped to have a private word with   
		                  
		Adonis, but if thatís the way you want it.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 What are you doing? You canít.  
		I...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (starting to dial)  
		                  
		Do you think the boy you saved might   
		                  
		identify your husband as his purchaser,   
		                  
		Deborah? And then, your brotherís not   
		                  
		buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy   
		                  
		will...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 He... He is dead!  
		                    
		(he goes on dialling; SHE STANDS...)  
		                  
		MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  
		                   (Lombard  
		turns to her, sceptical)  
		                 Call my parents.  
		Theyíll tell you. Call   
		                 them!
 
        
		Lombard hesitates, hangs up...  IN ON Deborah; she suddenly looks   
		       gaunt and tired...   
		Tears once again well-up in her eyes...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Do you think weíd let him  
		get away with   
		                 the murder of my brother?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 We? You and your parents killed  
		your   
		                 husband?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 No. Not us...
 
        
		She looks dazed for a moment, reaches for a new cigarette, lights   
		       it with a trembling hand...  
		Lombard just peers at her, waiting...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 They found his body yesterday.  
		In the pool   
		                 at our house in Sao Paulo.  
		He drowned.   
		                 Drank too much, went  
		for a swim and   
		                 drowned.
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (with a frown  
		of disbelief)  
		                 Your flunkey said he  
		was expected back   
		                 tonight.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 The staff donít know yet...  
		                    
		(off his baffled look)  
		                 I called my  
		parents, told them   
		                 everything...  
		                    
		(she sits down again, too weak to   
		                     
		stand)  
		                 I just couldnít take any more...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Get to the point, will you...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 My parents flew back from  
		Israel... Told   
		                 him they would get  
		him killed unless he   
		                 flew back to  
		Brazil immediately and agreed   
		                 to  
		a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...   
		                    
		(she drags deeply on her cigarette)  
		                  
		And his drowning was arranged...
 
       Lombard just goes on looking at her...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 He took away five years of  
		my life and my   
		                 brother. He was sick,  
		but perhaps it   
		                 wasnít his fault...  
		His parents bought   
		                 young girls for  
		him when he reached the   
		                 age. For  
		him to gain sexual experience.   
		                 When  
		he had finished or grew tired of   
		                  
		them, they were sold off to procurers and   
		                  
		replaced. Itís common practice in Brazil,   
		                  
		he said. The wealthy buy the children of   
		                  
		starving parents. He got a taste for it...
 
       Lombard just watches her... no sympathy whatsoever  
		in his eyes...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 So you did talk about it,  
		huh?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 On... Once...   
		                    
		(off Lombardís look: ĎOnce, eh...í)  
		                  
		Once... What are we... you going to do?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 What do you suggest?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I donít know. Everyoneís dead...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                   (he nods, A LONG  
		BEAT, then:)  
		                 Your parents arranged  
		the visit to my   
		                 office?
 
        
		She nods... Lombard makes for the table, turns the contact sheet   
		       over... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Tell them to meet me there  
		in the main   
		                 square at two tomorrow.  
		They better be   
		                 there. And no bad  
		things. Iíve taken   
		                 precautions against  
		bad things.
 
       She peers at...   
		       ...the word ĎPENRHYNDEUDRAETHí...  
		Looks up....
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 What are you going to do?
 
        
		Lombard peers at her, icily... She just looks back, shaken, but   
		       defiant...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Why the hell couldnít you  
		divorce the man?
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 (she dithers, sneers...)  
		                  
		You wouldnít understand.
 
       He just looks at her, waiting...  IN ON Deborah; a flicker  
		of   
		       fear... Then...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 Shame... And then, a good  
		girl does not   
		                 divorce...  My  
		parents...  
		                   (she frowns,  
		then, surprise in her   
		                     
		voice as she says:)  
		                 Do you know, they  
		might pass on the family   
		                 fortune  
		to a cousin?
 
       IN ON Lombard; mystified... IN ON Deborah; her haughty self again.
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I told you you wouldnít understand.
 
        
		Lombard eyes her... He neednít tell her whatís on his mind, his   
		       eyes do it... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Donít forget to convey my  
		message to your   
		                 parents. Goodbye,  
		Mrs De Moraes.
 
       Her eyes follow him, then, as he opens the door...
 
                                   
		DEBORAH  
		                 I... We have to bury Leon  
		tommorrow...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 The dead can wait.
 
        
		HOLD ON Deborah as he slams the door behind him; she starts, then   
		       just goes on staring at the  
		door, hurt but still proud...
 

       EXT. RHIANíS COTTAGE. DAY.
 
        
		A GREY DAY.  Rhian, her daughter and Shiva play football near the   
		       river...   
		        
		THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW: Mr and Mrs Spitz sit at the kitchen   
		       table, watching them, he uneasy,  
		she hard...
 

       INT. KITCHEN, RHIANíS COTTAGE DAY.
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 One will have to regularize  
		the boyís   
		                 situation in this country,  
		Mr Lombard.
 
       Lombard sits at the opposite end of the table, smoking...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Iím sure youíll find a way,  
		Mrs Spitz. You   
		                 have ways of getting  
		what you want.
 
       Silence as they stare hard at each other...
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 £10,000 a year to the girl  
		for as long as   
		                 she looks after the  
		boy?
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Plus a trust fund to provide  
		for the boyís   
		                 education.
 
        
		The Spitzes exchange a glance, agree... Mr Spitz turns to Lombard:
 
                                  
		MR SPITZ  
		                 It will be done.
 
        
		Lombard nods, watches them for a moment, then:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Look at it this way. He might  
		achieve   
		                 everything your son never  
		did.
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Jah...
 
        
		The two Spitzes turn to the window again as... The boy kicks the   
		       football high into the air...  
		Mr Spitz watches it arc... Says   
		       wistfully:
 
                                  
		MR SPITZ  
		                 Maybe we waited too long  
		to have children.
 
                                  
		MRS SPITZ  
		                 Maybe children should listen  
		to their   
		                 parents.  
		                    
		(she stands; to Lombard:)  
		                 We own a  
		cottage like this in Norfolk. I   
		                 wanted  
		Leonard to go there after his   
		                 return  
		from America. But he would not live   
		                  
		in the countryside because he could not   
		                  
		drive. Had he listened and stayed out of   
		                  
		London perhaps none of this would have   
		                  
		happened.  
		                   (she turns to  
		the door)  
		                 Come on, Albert. We have  
		taken enough of   
		                 Mr Lombardís time. 
 
       IN ON Lombard; a puzzled frown...
 

       EXT. RHIANíS  
		COTTAGE. DAY.
 
       MUSIC SLOWLY RISES: Pink Floydís ĎWish You Were Here: Part 1í...   
		        
		At the bottom of the field the old Spitzes turn out of sight along   
		       the track...  
		        
		By the cottage; Lombard, frowning, watches them go and turns to...   
		       Rhian stands smiling sadly  
		at him, hugging her daughter to her   
		       legs... 
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 How did Leon and the boy get  
		here, Rhian?  
		                   (off her  
		frown)  
		                 Leon couldnít drive. How did  
		he bring the   
		                 boy here? And donít  
		tell me they came by   
		                 train.
 
        
		IN ON Rhian; she stares back him, then smiles, a guilty smile...
 
                                    
		RHIAN  
		                 No. They didnít come by train...
 
        
		Lombard peers hard at her... sighs and turns to...  
		       By the river, Shiva is tossing stones into  
		the rushing water...  
		       Lombard swallows, tight-lipped, and turns to survey... The   
		        
		hills... the woods... Looks down the field, locks eyes with a   
		       SHEEP, watching smugly...   
		        
		       He looks back at Rhian, she makes to speak... He waves a hand,   
		        
		turns away...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 I donít want to know.
 
        
		He flicks his cigarette away and starts down the field... THE   
		       MUSIC GOES ON RISING...
 

        
		EXT. PENRHYNDEUDRAETH, MAIN SQUARE. DAY.
 
       A bunch of noisy SCHOOLGIRLS at the bus stop near  
		the red phone   
		       box...    
		       On the road, Lombardís Triumph  
		comes into sight...
 

       INT. TRIUMPH. DAY.
 
       Lombard  
		glances at the schoolgirls... pulls hard down on the   
		       wheel, pulls up at the kerb...  He  
		leans across, winds down the   
		       passenger window, then, deadpan:
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Baa baa. Iím looking for the  
		speaking   
		                 sheep.
 
        
		The girls gape at him... exchange dazed looks, suppress giggles...   
		       IN ON Lombard; he coldly runs  
		his eyes over them, frowns seeing...  
		       IN ON A GORGEOUS LITTLE GIRL (about ten); tight-lipped, she  
		looks   
		       guiltily down as Lombardís eyes reach her...
 
                                   
		LOMBARD  
		                 Sheep donít wear watches and  
		little girls   
		                 donít scratch, hey?
 
        
		The little girl glances up at Lombard, chuckles and turns her back   
		       to him with both hands over  
		her mouth to suppress her giggles...   
		       Lombard goes on frowning at her, then starts winding his  
		window   
		       up, eyeing...    
		       IN ON ANOTHER SCHOOLGIRL: a bewildered  
		expression...  
		       Lombard pulls away... THE MUSIC GOES ON RISING...
 

        
		EXT. PENRHYNDEUDRAETH. MAIN SQUARE. DAY.
 
       WIDE VIEW - the schoolgirls at the bus stop all  
		watch as Lombardís   
		       Triumph drives off into the distance...  THE MUSIC GOES ON RISING   
		        
		AS...  
		       DISSOLVE TO BLACK... THEN, AS THE MUSIC GOES ON, MOODY...
 

        
		EXT. ROAD ALONG FINSBURY PARK. DAY.
 
       WIDE VIEW, THROUGH A VEIL OF RAIN: the stretch of road  
		between THE   
		       DIPLOMAT and THE AMBASSADOR is lined with POLICE CARS... UNIFORMED   
		        
		POLICE OFFICERS loiter, arms folded or hands in pockets, at the   
		       hotels doors... On the pavement,  
		near a parked WHITE MERCEDES,   
		       PETER (from ĎLe Mercuryí) and his driver stand arguing with a   
		        
		couple of police officers... THE MUSIC CARRIES OVER... HARD CUT   
		       TO:
 

        
		EXT. PARLIAMENT HILL CAFE. HAMPSTEAD HEATH. DAY.
 
       LOMBARDíS EYES, fixed, staring through  
		the rain... PULLING OUT...   
		       his face; lips tight, face and hair wet with rain... He looks worn  
		       out, haunted...
 
       PULLING OUT FURTHER we see... He sits  
		over a coffee at a metal   
		       terrace table outside the cafeís steamed-up glass front, his hand   
		        
		manically tapping his pack of Gitanes on the table... Beside him,   
		       NATHALIE also sits silent over  
		a coffee, smoking, also staring   
		       grimly ahead, one arm folded across her body... The only two  
		       customers outside...  And we continue to PULL OUT until they have   
		        
		become two anonymous, featureless people...  Until the cafe is   
		       just a building in the expanse  
		of the Heath... Until the Heath is   
		       just a spreading patch of green in the aerial view of WET  
		NORTH   
		       LONDON...  
		          #...Remember when you were  
		young, you shone like the sun...#
