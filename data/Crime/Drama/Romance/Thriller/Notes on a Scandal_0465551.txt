FADE IN:

EXT. PARLIAMENT HILL, NORTH LONDON - DAY (SEPTEMBER)

Barbara alone on a bench. She is high above the city, the
view is magnificent.

She watches the couples, kids playing, families.
BARBARA (V.0.)
People have always trusted me with their
secrets.
INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY
Barbara writing her diary in her one bedroom, basement flat.

BARBARA (V.0.)
But who do I trust with mine?

A whole shelf of hardback notebooks, her collection of
diaries dating back to the 1950’s.

BARBARA (V.O.)
You. Only you.
EXT. ARCHWAY ROAD - EARLY MORNING
The roar of traffic. The urban ravine of the Archway Road.

The red, black and gold cast-iron ‘suicide bridge’ which
straddles it.

Barbara driving to work in her old W Polo.

EXT. ST GEORGE’S SCHOOL/CAR PARK —- MORNING

The school is a bleak, Victorian building with various modern
add-ons.

Barbara locks her car and heads for the main entrance.

INT. CLASSROOM —- MINUTES LATER

Barbara takes out her lesson planner, text books, registrar.
She organizes them neatly on her desk.

Barbara stares at the rows of empty desks and chairs.
BARBARA (V.0.)
The first day of a new term.

Sound of PUPILS arriving outside. Barbara observes them from
her high window.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

Kids in school uniform stream through the gates.

BARBARA (V.0.)
Here come the local pubescent proles.

They play football, gossip, fight and skirmish. A diverse
ethnic mix, about fifty percent white.

BARBARA (V.O.)
The future shop assistants and plumbers. And
doubtless the odd terrorist too.
A teacher (BRIAN) oversees the general activity.

SHEBA HART comes in through the main gates pushing her tatty,
old bicycle. She looks a little lost.

Brian directs her to the bike racks.

INT/EXT. RECEPTION AREA/MAIN COURTYARD - LATER

Barbara watches TED MAWSON (Deputy Head) outside with Sheba,
he’s introducing her to MEMBERS OF STAFF passing by.

BARBARA (V.0.)
In the old days we confiscated cigarettes and
‘wank mags’. Now it’s knives and crack
cocaine. And they call it progress.

The school bell rings and Sheba is whisked away in another
direction.
INT. CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Barbara writes ‘Wittenberg’ on the board. Other stray phrases
already there: ‘Diet of worms’ ‘Martin Luther’.

She’s teaching ‘The Reformation’ to a class of bored 16 year
olds.

The bell rings. The kids immediately snatch up their hooks to
leave. Barbara makes a gesture - they sit back down.
RID
(under his breath)
Fuckin’ poison granny.

Barbara surveys her class. Another gesture: ‘you may go’.

INT. SPORTS HALL - AFTER-NOON (A WEEK LATER)

A committee meeting of around TWENTY TEACHERS chaired by the
Headmaster, SANDY PABBLEM.

His secretary (GITA) takes notes. The staff sit in chairs in
a circle, Barbara amongst them. In passing we see teachers
ELAINE CLIFFORD and SUE HODGE.

PABBLEM
Before we start, can those of you who haven’t
delivered your reports please lob ‘em in my
general direction.

He goes round the circle. Staff hand him their school issue
report files, all thick with their work.

PABBLEM
Thanks Bill, Elaine. Thank you, Linda - how’s
Greg?

LINDA

A bit better, thanks.

He holds his hands together - a gesture of emotional
solidarity.

PABBLEM
Good, good.

Sheba comes in mouthing apologies for her lateness.

PABBLEM
Ah! Has everyone met our new Art teacher,
Sheba Hart?

General murmars of ‘hello’ and ‘welcome’.

PABBLEM
I’ve invited Sheba to sit in on this meeting.
As you know, I regard The Arts as absolutely
central to our policy of ‘reform through
nurture.’
Barbara gestures to the empty chair beside her. But another
teacher (BILL RUMER) is comically commanding Sheba to sit
next to him. Which she does.

PABBLEM
Welcome to you.

Sheba takes out a note-pad and pen, looking nervous but keen.
Pabblem continues collecting the reports.

PABBLEM
Thank you, Sue. Ooh, that’s a big one! I’1ll be
up ‘til the crack of dawn. Anyone else not
handed in their homework?

He turns to Barbara, a hint of nervousness.

PABBLEM
Barbara...?

Barbara coolly produces her file. It’s impossibly thin.
Pabblem pretends to weigh it on his hand go that others can
witness its paucity.

Encouraged by polite laughter he opens it to reveal a single
sheet of typed paper.

PABBLEM
This is your report? On the History
Department? On its entire workings? And your
general thoughts for its future development?

BARBARA
You’ll find it’s quite thorough, Headmaster.

The teachers look tense but one or two are secretly amused —
this is vintage Barbara. Gita looks appalled.

Pabblem stares at the report; it’s one paragraph long.

PABBLEM

(reads aloud)
‘The History Department functions much as one
would expect for a school of this stature and
intake. Examination results have been
consistent for thirty years; below the
national average but above the level of
catastrophe. Recommendation: no change
necessary’.

Barbara looks innocent, defying Pabblem to explode-
BARBARA
It took me most of the summer to write it.

He stares at her in impotent fury.
Barbara sneaks a look at Sheba.
BARBARA (V.0.)
Hard to read the wispy novice. Is she a sphinx
or simply stupid?
EXT. PLAYGROUND - LUNCH—TIME (A WEEK LATER)

Sheba on playground duty, wrapped in a coat, she’s patrolling
amongst the children. Barbara lurks nearby.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Artfully dishevelled today. The tweedy tramp
coat is an abhorrence. It seems to say, ‘I’m
just like you’. But clearly she is not.

Sheba intervenes between two kids sparring for a fight.

BARBARA (V.0.)
A fey person, I suspect. Fey.

suddenly - a roar from some BOYS playing football. The goal
scorer, a BOY of fifteen, celebrates by whipping his shirt
off and waving it in jubilation - naked from the waist up.

BARBARA
Put your shirt on!

BOY
I got the winner, Miss!

BARBARA
Glory be. Shirt.

Barbara glances at Sheba. She seems to be looking straight at
her. Barbara wonders if Sheba disapproves her ticking off the
boy. As he runs away:

BARBARA
Good goal!

INT. SCHOOL CANTEEN - DAY

Barbara with her tray cating lunch.
BARBARA (V.0.)
She has certainly rippled the waters of our
stagnant pond. They flock to her.

She watches Brian approaching Sheba.
BARBARA (V.0O.)
Even limp, little Brian had a go. Oh, the ‘
horror.

Other TEACHERS, almost queuing for Sheba’s attention. :

INT/EXT. CANTEEN/COURTYARD - ANOTHER DAY

BARBARA (V.O.)
And Fatty Hodge has pounced on her.

Barbara at a grubby canteen table - watching with a seemingly
benign smile.

Sheba and SUE HODGE are on a bench outside, bathed in
sunlight as they eat their sandwiches.

BARBARA (V.0.)
A dubious double-act; the blonde and the pig
in knickers.

Sue chews like a rabbit as Sheba chortles.

INT. STAFF ROOM - A WEEK LATER

Barbara on a break. A few other TEACHERS dotted around. Brian
comes in looking a little sheepish.

BRIAN
I just went past the Art Studio...

Barbara glances up-

BRIAN .
It’s bloody Lord of the Flies in there.

ELAINE CLIFFORD
Have they gone for her?

BRIAN
(nods)
Torn her posters down, full on paint fight,
they're chanting, ‘get your tits out for the
lads’. Girls too. It’s carnage.
Barbara looks concerned, shares a shake of the head with
Elaine. Bill looks up from the coffee station.

BILL
How was Madam?

BRIAN
Totally lost it.
(imitates Sheba)
‘Stop it! Stop it you little fucking
bastards.’

ELAINE
You should’ve stepped in.

Brian looks anxious, thinks she’s right.

BILL
He didn’t want to patronize the little lady.
She’1l be alright. The bourgeoisie need a good
pasting now and then, reminds ‘em where the
true power resides.

He lobs a tea-bag in his mug.

BILL
This time next year she’ll be Headmistress.

Antonia - another teacher - explodes:

ANTONIA
Oh Christ, will you shut up?! I’m trying to
work!

She gestures to a mountain of school books she’s marking.

BILL
(sarcastic)
Sorry, sorry. Char, anyone?
(pointedly)
Babs?

BARBARA
Milk, no sugar.

BILL
Sweet enough?

BARBARA
Evidently.

ELAINE
Didn't her father invent inflation?

 
BRIAN
You what?

ELAINE
Wasn’t her dad that academic; Donald whatsit?
Economics bloke, he invented the word
‘inflation’.

BRIAN
(lying)
Oh yeah, yeah, I know who you mean.

BARBARA
I think you’ll find that Mrs Hart’s father was
Professor Ronald Taylor. He didn’t ‘invent
inflation’, he devised a theory about the
relationship between inflation and consumer
expectation.

A silence. Brian and Elaine share a look at Barbara’s
expense.
INT. RECEPTION AREA - A WEEK LATER

The school day over. Barbara walks through the lobby. she
hears loud noises from the library and goes to look.

A photocopied sign on the door: HOMEWORK CLUB.
Through the window she sees TWO BOYS fighting and Sheba
desperately trying to separate them. OTHER KIDS encourage the
fighters. It’s mayhem.
SHEBA

Stop this immediately! Stop it both of you or

you’1l be up before the Head!
Barbara waits: let Sheba suffer or be her saviour?

The chaos continues - she takes a deep breath then bursts in,
bellowing:

Int. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

BARBARA
ENOUGH!

Immediate silence. She parts the boys with swift and vigorous
force. Sheba is hugely relieved but Barbara’s not finished

yet.
BARBARA
(To the boys)
Outside. Now!

The two boys file out. Barbara surveys the rest of the class.
A BOY has a baseball cap on. Barbara points to her head, the
boy removes the cap from his own.

BARBARA
(To other kids)
Get on with your work!

Which they do, at once. And then Barbara marches out.
Sheba is unsure whether she’s supposed to follow. Barbara
gestures for her to come with.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LIBRARY — MOMENTS LATER

The boys are looking at the floor, hands in pockets.

BARBARA
Why were they fighting, Mrs Hart?

SHEBA
The motive was unclear.

BARBARA
(To first boy)
Davis I know - you’re a little thug, aren’t
you?
(To second boy)
And who might you be?

The second boy is STEVEN CONNOLLY (15).

 

STEVEN
(mumbling)

Steven Connolly, Miss.

BARBARA
What?

STEVEN
Steven Connolly, Miss.

BARBARA
Year?

STEVEN

Year Ten, Miss.
BARBARA
(suddenly remembers )
The naked footballer. Why were you fighting?
(beat)
It’s a perfectly simple question.

STEVEN
Dunno, Miss.

BARBARA
You don’t know. One minute you’re an inert
lump, the next you’re attempting to castrate a
fellow pupil. Nothing cccurred between these
two states?

STEVEN
No, Miss.

BARBARA
(cod Irish accent)
Don’t be a hero, Connolly, it’s hardly da
place.
(pause)
Yes? Brain - mouth - and speak.

STEVEN
(reluctantly)
He was saying stuff about Miss.
(nods at Sheba)
He was bang out of order.

This is news to Sheba.

BARBARA
(To Davis)
What did you say?

DAVIS
I never said nothing-

BARBARA
(correcting him)
‘I didn’t say anything’.
(To Connolly)
What did he say? Oh, come on!

CONNOLLY
He said she’s a tart...he said he gave her one
up the arse.

Sheba is shocked, Barbara is not.
BARBARA
(To Davis)
Did you indeed? Odious boy, apologize at once.

DAVIS
(To Sheba)
Sorry, Miss.

BARBARA
Deputy Head in the morning. Now back in, both
of you.

The boys shuffle in to the library. Sheba shakes her head.

BARBARA
Little towers of testosterone, you'll get used
to them.

SHEBA

Thank you so much. I’d better...
She gestures to the library but Barbara holds out her hand.

SHEBA
oh, sorry, we haven’t met properly, have we?
Sheba Hart. Art department.

They shake hands.

BARBARA
Barbara Covett. History.

Barbara watches Sheba go back in. And smiles for the first
time.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Quite a nice voice, plummy and deep. As if her
mouth was pure, as if she’d never had a
filling.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - ANOTHER DAY

Barbara and Sheba on playground duty. They smile at each
other.

BARBARA (V.0-)
The complexion of a white peach. One can
almost see her veins.
INT. SCHOOL CANTEEN — ANOTHER DAY

BARBARA (V.0O.)
Her trendy politics are similarly transparent .

Barbara, Sheba and Sue in the busy lunch queue.

BARBARA
We serve them best if we teach them to read,
write and add. They don’t need to know about
the basket weavers of Chile.

SUE
Barbara’s very keen on the basics.

Sheba helps herself to some sad looking coleslaw.

SHEBA
(To Barbara)
But when you started, didn’t you want to give
them a...a real education? To help them
overcome - well...
(sotto)
-.-the poverty of their backgrounds?

BARBARA
Yes of course but one soon learns that
teaching is crowd control - we’re a branch of
the social services.

Barbara spots a boy stealing a Kit Kat.

BARBARA
(To boy)
Put it back!

Sheba looks mournful, Sue tries to rally her.

SUE
Console yourself with the gems. Every now and
then you find one with an agile mind and a
will to learn. That’s when it’s satisfying,
when you can really make a difference.

Sheba seems to really ‘hear’ this.

BARBARA
The rest is just cattle prod and pray.

They carry their trays to a vacant table. Barbara watches
Sheba intently, she seems so defeated by it all. But her
sadness is beautiful to behold...

[a
[3

BARBARA (V.0.)
I can see why others are beguiled by her.

EXT. ART STUDIO - LATE AFTER-NOON (ANOTHER DAY)
Barbara waiting outside.

BARBARA (V.0.)
But I wonder if she possesses the requisite
heft?

Sheba emerges pulling on her coat, surprised to see Barbara
there.

BARBARA
Fancy a coffee?

SHEBA
Mmm.

They head off. But then Barbara spots SUE emerging from the
other side of the playground. She tries to usher Sheba at
speed but Sue is gaining on them. A chase!

Fatally, Barbara glances back and Sheba follows suit. she
sees the panting Sue and waits for her to join them - much to
Barbara’s frustration.

INT. GREASY CAFF — LATER

Barbara smoking - ever so slightly sulking. Sue and Sheba sip
cappuccinos. Sue mock taps the table with her spoon.

SUE
Ahem. I’ve got a bit of an announcement:

BARBARA
You’re leaving St George’s?

SUE
No!

BARBARA
(flatly)
oh, you’re pregnant.

Sue registers a moment of anti-climactic sadness.
SHEBA

That’s fantastic! Congratulations! When are
you due?
SUE
June the seventh.

SHEBA
A summer baby, how lovely.

BARBARA
So you'll be taking maternity leave?

SUE
Mmm, can’t wait!

Barbara nods, encouragingly.

BARBARA
Rest is so important.

SHEBA
Do you know what it is?

Sheba catches Barbara’s eye and suggests she put her
cigarette out. Barbara does so but only to please her.

SUE
Rog reckons it’s a boy but I'm certain it’s a
girl. Aren’t they supposed to be iow slung? I
can’t believe nobody noticed, I’m 14 weeks!
Didn’t you see how chunky I’m getting?!

Barbara notices a dab of froth on Sheba’s nose. She hands her
a serviette. Sheba thanks her with a smile.
EXT. CHEMIST/STREET - LATER

Barbara and Sheba waiting outside. Sue inside buying a hot
water bottle.

SHEBA

Do you want to come for lunch, on Sunday?
BARBARA

Where?
SHEBA

To mine, to our house.

BARBARA
Won't you be with your family?

SHEBA
Yes but you’re very welcome. It’s no big deal,
I’1l just do a lasagne or something.
BARBARA
I adore lasagne.

 

Barbara is almost blushing.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - SATURDAY

BARBARA (V.O.)
Bliss!

Women's wear. A SHOP ASSISTANT nods as Barbara discusses the
virtues of a skirt she’s interested in.

BARBARA (V.O.)
A merry flag on the Arctic wilderness of my
calendar.
Shoe Department. Five different pairs for consideration.
To ANOTHER SHOP ASSISTANT’s relief Barbara finally plumps for
a pair of black, low heelers with a strap.
INT. HAIRDRESSERS - SAME DAY
Barbara seemingly asleep while the GIRL washes her hair.
BARBARA (V.0.)
One must make an effort when one receives an
invitation.
She half opens one eye and sees the girl making faces. The
gixl at the next sink mocks her own customer similarly.

INT. BARBARA’S FLAT - EVENING

Barbara walks into the bedroom in her new heels. She twirls
in front of the mirror, ‘catching herself’.

BARBARA (V.0.)
The art of it is seeming not to.

Barbara carefully spray starches her white blouse.

INT/EXT. BARBARA’S CAR/STREET - SUNDAY

Barbara cruising down the street looking for a space. Her VW
Polo incongrucus amongst the smart cars already parked.
BARBARA (V.0.)
Lasagne tends to disagree with my bowels...

She parks and takes out her compact, touches up her make up.
She’s early. And nervous.

BARBARA (V.O.)
T’1l ask for a small portion.

She lights a cigarette. Determined to stay calm.

EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE ~- TEN MINUTES LATER
Barbara walks up the front steps of a large Victorian house.

She observes the front garden; a cherry tree, a rusty bike, a
mildewed cricket bat handle impaled in the unkempt grass.

She stands there, pristine in her grey skirt, white blouse,
new black heels. She holds a bunch of flowers.

She composes herself and presses the bell. No sound.
She tries again. Waits. Nothing. She tries the knocker.

The door is opened by a tall, slightly shaggy MAN in his late
fifties.

BARBARA
I think I’ve come to the wrong house.

MAN

(smiles) .
No, you're bang on. I’m Richard. Come in!

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

BARBARA
I’m so sorry, I thought—

RICHARD
That I’‘d be twenty years younger and twice as
handsome.

He helps her out of her coat.
RICHARD

Sorry, were you out there long? The bell’s
knackered.

/lo
He dumps her coat over the bannister. The hall is cluttered
with junk, boots, bicycles etc.

RICHARD
Bash!

A flustered Sheba pokes her head out the kitchen.

SHEBA
Hi, Barbara! The kitchen’s on fire!

Richard raises an eyebrow and ushers Barbara:

INT. SITTING ROOM — CONTINUOUS

BARBARA
Oh, what a splendid room.

RICHARD
What can I get you? We’re semi-pro drinkers
here; absinthe, hooch, pick your poison.

BARBARA
Could I have a dry sherry, please?

RICHARD
Erm...I might have some apricot brandy
knocking around...

BARBARA
Or a dry white wine?

RICHARD
Done. Have a seat.

Barbara takes in the room; the look is ‘battered bourgeois’ -—

the big sofas, the bare boards, paintings, overflowing
bookshelves, Sunday papers.

She sits in an armchair and finds herself semi-recumbent such

is its hidden depth. A GIRL of 15 drifts in. She quietly
observes as Barbara struggles to sit up.

BARBARA
You must be Polly.

POLLY
(shrugs)
Must be. Hi.

BARBARA
I’m Barbara.
POLLY
Hi, Barbara.

Polly’s contempt is instantaneous but she makes a vague stab
at concealing it.

She flops into a sofa, sips her bottle of Evian.

POLLY
Are you going somewhere?

BARBARA
Excuse me?

POLLY
You’re all poshed up.

BARBARA
Oh...I have an appointment. Later. In town.
(beat)
Have you always lived here?

POLLY
Mum inherited it. It’s her little joke -

RICHARD
(coming in)
- I only married her for the property.

He carries an opened bottle of wine and glasses.

RICHARD
(To Polly)
Morning.
He hands drinks round.
RICHARD

Did Pete go?
Polly nods.

RICHARD
He was welcome to stay.

POLLY
He’s not really into lunch.

RICHARD
(To Barbara)
cheers.

IB
BARBARA
Mom. What is it?

RICHARD
A witless Chardonnay.

BARBARA
Are you interested in wine?

RICHARD
Only the drinking part. You?

BARBARA
Well, I spent a portion of the summer on the
Amalfi coast and I became-

She's interrupted by loud thumps as someone thunders down the
wooden stairs.

RICHARD
Here’s trouble...

BEN runs in and leaps head first onto the sofa.

RICHARD
Easy, Rocky! Easy!

Ben is twelve. He has Down’s Syndrome. Barbara didn’t know.

She watches Richard and his son playfully fighting with each
other.

BARBARA (V.0.)
I'd anticipated a suave, young lawyer and two
perfect poppets. Not so. She's married some
crumbling patriarch - he’s nearly as old as
me!

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Everyone sat at the big table, eating their slightly burnt
lasagne and salad-

Barbara has a tiny portion, almost untouched. She conceals it
with a large lettuce leaf.
BARBARA (V.0.)
And then there’s the daughter; a pocket
princess.

Polly picks at her food, uninterested.
; BARBARA (V.0.)
And finally, a somewhat tiresome court jester.

Ben wolfs his food down, makin hi s i
habitually. 1 g a mess which Sheba wipes up

BEN
I’m going to be a wizard.

BARBARA
Oh? ...Is that when you‘re a growh up...?

SHEBA
No, he’s just been cast in his school play!

Ben beams with pride as Sheba hugs him.

RICHARD
(critic’s voice)
Amongst next year’s cultural highlights I
greatly look forward to Benjamin Hart in the
key role of ‘The Wizard’. Indeed I find myself
to be beside myself with anticipation for this
doubtless auspicious stage debut.

As Richard continues...
BARBARA (V.O.)

A rogue image swam through me, hubby’s pruney
old mouth pursed at Sheba’s breast.

INT. SITTING ROOM - LATER

Sheba and Ben are dancing to ‘Funky Kingston’ by Toots and
the Maytals up loud on the Bang & Olufsen.

BARBARA (V.O.)
After lunch a rather mortifying family
tradition...

Sheba’s quite drunk and having a ball. Richard moves to his
own slower rhythm amusing the delighted Ben.

BARBARA (V.O.)
They do things differently in bourgeois
bohemia.

Polly and Barbara, sour bedfellows on the sofa, both mortally
embarrassed.

Polly offers Barbara a fag which she accepts gratefully.

0
As the music continues Barbara's expression changes: her
admiration for Sheba’s enthusiasm, her love for her son, her
natural warmth, her beauty...

As Sheba dances Barbara is almost overcome by her.

Richard grooves up and encourages Polly to join in. She bats
him away and draws on her Marlboro Light. Now he tries to
haul Barbara to her feet, she protests but he's relentless.
Polly - the traitor - ‘helps’ her up.

Barbara stands in the centre of the room. An awkward moment
as she half raises her arms for a formal dance but Richard’s
not there to reciprocate.

Ben grabs Barbara’s hand and they dance.

A mobile phone rings - unheard by all except Polly. She
passes it to her mother.

Sheba goes out into the hallway to speak. Her conversation
seems intense, possibly furtive...

EXT. GARDEN ~ LATER

Richard and Ben are playing French Cricket. The garden is
large, rambling and overgrown.

Barbara and Sheba head to a partially concealed SUMMER HOUSE
at the back. Sheba carries coffee and biscuits on a tray.

SHEBA
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about Ben - not
that it’s - just sometimes people don’t quite
know how to react.

BARBARA
Wot at ali, he’s charming.
(beat)
Has it been difficult?

SHEBA
Well, you just get on with it, don’t you?
Polly’s the tricky one but who isn’t at
fifteen? I was impossible.

BARBARA
Surely not!

SHEBA
Wilful and flighty - lethal combination. You?
BARBARA
I think I was rather quiet.

SHEBA
Did you want children?

BARBARA
Mmm. But I never found the time.

They reach the large, bashed up Summer house.

BARBARA
How wonderful.

SHEBA
Richard took me away for our wedding
anniversary, years ago. When we got back it
was here, as if by magic.

They go inside.

INT. SUMMER HOUSE -— CONTINUOUS.

Barbara sips her coffee, conscious she’s in Sheba’s ‘lair’
and feeling privileged to be so.

The ‘studio’ is full of Sheba’s pottery works, drawings and
sketches. A comfy, messy den of curios and artefacts.

SHEBA
It was supposed to be my studio but it’s more
of a refuge really.

BARBARA
A room of one’s own.

There’s a big stack of vinyl LP’s and 7” singles by the
stereo. A large photo pinned to the wall amongst a collage of
other images. Sheba as a teemager with a gang of friends,
exotically dressed in post punk splendour - heavy eye make up
etc. Threatening, confident, sexy.

BARBARA
Is this you?

SHEBA
Well...it was.

Barbara admires some glazed plates on a shelf.

BARBARA
I like these. Such vibrant colours.

ae
3

SHEBA
Take one. Take two. Have the lot actually.

BARBARA
Oh, I couldn’t possibly.

Sheba takes a few down and hands them to her.

SHEBA
Honestly, no one else wants them.

BARBARA
I’ll treasure them.

Too intense, too much - Barbara knows it.

Sheba starts wrapping the plates in old newspaper. Barbara
carefully sits on a rickety chair.

BARBARA
It must be exhausting, running a family and
teaching as well?

SHEBA
I can’t wait for term to end. Roll on
Christmas and a month of sod all. Oh, I
shouldn’t have kidded myself I could teach.
I’ve spent the last ten years looking after
Ben - I was desperate to get out and do
something - finally we got him into this great
local school and I'm free to work and...

She shakes her head at the difficulty of it all.

BARBARA
You’‘re going to be a terrific teacher.
SHEBA
Thanks, but I’m bloody hopeless and everyone

knows it.

She finishes with the plates and flops into the shabby, old
sofa.

BARBARA
Children are feral, don’t let them sense your
anxiety.

SHEBA

How do you cope?
BARBARA
Oh, I’m a battle-axe. I’m not popular but at
least they respect me.

SHEBA
Well, you’re popular with me.

Barbara smiles. A hint of therapist and patient. Barbara on
her chair, Sheba on the couch - the hip bone exposed, the
ankles, her hands waving as she continues to talk.

BARBARA (V.0)
She spoke of her ‘vile’ mother, her grief over
the death of her father, the glory days when
Richard scooped her up and then jettisoned his
wife and children for what she called a ‘non
stop fuckfest.’ It's a peculiar trait of the
privileged: immediate, incautious intimacy.
But Sheba went well beyond the tendencies of
her class. She was utterly candid; a novice
confessing to the mother superior.

It’s getting dark outside. Richard and Ben have gone in.

The atmosphere in the Summer House is intimate now, sisterly.

Sheba concludes her long speech:

SHEBA
But you know, marriage and kids, it’s
wonderful but it doesn’t give you meaning. It
gives you an imperative but it doesn’t help
you...my father used to say - you know on the
tube - ‘Mind The Gap’.

Barbara looks a little confused.
SHEBA
I dunno, the distance between life as you
dream it and...
(softly)
...life as it is.

Barbara stares at her, rapt.
BARBARA
I know exactly what you mean.

INT. SITTING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

CLOSE: A gold star on a page of Barbara’s diary-
WS

BARBARA (V.O.)
A gold star day!

She sticks the star down with her thumb.
BARBARA (V.0O.)
I aiways knew we’d be friends. Out mutual
reserve inhibited us but now it is manifest; a
spiritual recognition!
As she continues to write we see the strangely anodyne
possessions of her life: the trinkets, the cat toys, etc.

INT. SCHOOL HALL ~ DAY

Assembly. Pabblem making announcements. The PUPILS sit in
rows. STAFF on a raised platform.

BARBARA (V.0.)
‘S’ and I share the ability to see through the
quotidian awfulness of things. In a different
(better) age we would be ladies of leisure;
lunching together, visiting galleries,
travelling, putting the world to rights.

Barbara sits behind Sheba who is casually twirling the hair
at the back of her neck. A strand falls into Barbara’s lap.

BARBARA (V.O.)
We would be companions.

The strand of hair taut between her fingers.

INT. SCHOOL HALL - LATE AFTER-NOON (DECEMBER)

The school carol concert. The last day of term.

A school band on stage doing a ‘rap’ version of ‘Hark The
Herald Angels Sing’. Toasting each other, the hoods, the
attitude.

Sue Hodge is conducting them, gleefully.

Pabblem beams. This is what his school is all about.

Brian is into the groove. He wears a Tottenham Hotspur
baseball cap and stuffs a mince pie in his gob.

Gita fakes enjoyment — in common with many other staff_
The kids are allowed to ‘dress down’. Some are in festive
fancy dress. Some clap along. Others throw food around.

Barbara sits at the end of a row. An empty seat beside her.
Bill tries to sit in it but Barbara says it’s reserved.

She looks around for Sheba. Not here. she slips out of the
room.

INT. BARBARA’S CLASSROOM.

Barbara goes over to the window and looks out. It’s dark
outside. There’s a dim light on in the Art Studio.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

Barbara heads for the exit. Christmas decorations and
children’s art fill the walls.

The rap music echoes down the empty corridor.

EXT. PLAYGROUND.

The playground in darkness. Barbara heads towards the Art
Studio. The light still on. But then it goes out.

Barbara waits for Sheba to emerge. But she doesn’t.
Now Barbara approaches, perplexed...

She hears a noise - a chair scraping back - male laughter, a
‘shhh’ - silence.

Barbara sneaks up to a window. Standing on tip toes she can
just see inside.

Darkness. Footsteps. A murmur...

And then...a match...a tiny flare of light. And then an
orange glow - a cigarette.

Still she can’t see properly, her eyes beginning to adjust.
She can make out Sheba’s desk now...

and Sheba sitting on her chair at the desk...

er shirt undone to the waist...

Barbara holds her breath.

alo
ot

Sheba’s mouth - she’s saying something...

And now the orange glow comes back into view.

She sees a white shirt. A man holding a cigarette.

Sheba gesturing - something to do with the cigarette...
The man stands in front of Sheba.

A playful exchange of words. He puts the cigarette out.
Sheba nods and then undoes his zip. Pulls him towards her.
Barbara watching as Sheba gives head.

The man comes quickly. Sheba’s hand on his mouth, silencing
him.

Barbara’s hand on her own mouth.

Distant applause and stamping. The carol concert’s finished.
The lovers hear the applause. They kiss passionately.

Sheba buttons her shirt. He goes to the door and slips out.

Barbara edges round the building to see him...it’s that boy —
fifteen year old - STEVEN CONNOLLY.

Barbara grips the wall for support.

Steven heads towards the school gates pulling his coat on and
lugging his school bag over his shoulder.

The Art Studio lights flash on.

Barbara turns back, sees Sheba picking something from the
floor - a fag butt. She wraps it in paper and pockets it.

CHILDREN and STAFF start streaming out the school doors.

Barbara alone for a moment before she’s engulfed.

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara sat in her armchair, still in shock. Thinking.
EXT. SUPERMARKET CAR PARK - DAY

Sheba and Ben loading the car with their shopping. Sheba
humps a box of mineral water into the boot.

Her mobile rings, she answers.
BARBARA (V.0)
It’s Barbara. I need to talk to you about
Steven Connolly.
Sheba freezes. The best she can do:

SHEBA (IN PHONE)
Who...?

INTERCUT AS
NECESSARY

INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME TIME
A thin smile from Barbara.
BARBARA (IN PHONE)
Let’s not, shall we? I’m afraid I’ve learnt of
your ‘activities’.
Sheba - horrified - before she can respond:
BARBARA
Doubtless you're aware you could go to jail.
I’m driving to Eastbourne tonight, I’m
spending Christmas with my sister. I’1l be
with you at five.
Barbara puts the phone down. Silence.

Then, a strange CROAK. Her cat, Portia, has vomited at her
feet.

EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

Before Barbara can knock Sheba comes out in her coat.

SHEBA
Let’s go to the pub, OK?

BARBARA
I brought you this, for all of you.
a

Barbara hands her a bottle of sherry. Sheba looks at. it like
it’s a bomb, then deposits it inside the door.
EXT. HIGHGATE STREETS/PUB - MOMENTS LATER

They walk in silence. Sheba sick with fear. Barbara has to
double her pace to keep up.

They arrive at the pub. It’s festooned with festive cheer. A
couple of drunks barge past them singing carols.

Barbara gestures to a wooden table with benches, chained to
the wall outside - quieter.

EXT. PUB - LATER

Sheba and Barbara sat with their drinks - a dry sherry and a
hefty scotch. Barbara lights a cigarette. Sheba is shaking
with fear (and cold).

‘SHEBA
So...when...when will you tell them?

Barbara is inscrutable, relishing her power.
BARBARA,
I need to know the circumstances. You must
inform me of everything.
Sheba takes a slug of her drink, her only option to comply.
SHEBA
Actually, you were there, when I first noticed
him...

EXT. PLAYGROUND — FLASHBACK

A roar. Steven scores his goal then whips his shirt off and
points in glory at Sheba.

SHEBA (V.0O.)
I think you gave him a telling off.

BARBARA (V-.0O.)
No, I gave him a slight ticking off.

Sheba gives Steven a little smile-
SHEBA (V.0.)
Be dedicated his goal to me. It was just a
sweet thing, it amused me.

Steven runs off past Barbara who tells him to put his shirt
back on.

But Sheba continues to gaze at the boy - his smooth skin, his
hips, his muscles moving as he pulls the shirt over his head.
INT. ART STUDIO - AFTER-NOON

Sheba alone, repairing her torn posters.

SHEBA (V.0.)
A few days later he came to see me.

steven comes in carrying a large envelope.

STEVEN
Miss, would you look at my drawings, please?

SHEBA
I’1l look at them in class. You do Art, don't
you?

STEVEN
I’m not allowed...
(embarrassed)
I'm special needs. I gotta do extra reading
instead.

SHEBA
You did these at home?

He nods and hands her the envelope.

Sheba looks at the boy’s ‘work’. Pencil sketches of fruit, a4
can of coke, a woman vaguely like herself, his own hands..-

SHEBA
These are good. You can draw.

Steven is thrilled.

SHEBA
Hands are very difficult, aren’t they?

STEVEN
Yeah, they’re a right bastard.

=O
3

SHEBA
You have to really study them, the bone
structure...look...

She does a quick sketch of his hands. She's talented, deft.
Her sketch is simple but clear.

STEVEN
Can I keep it, Miss?

She hands it to him - unsure if she’s already crossed a line.
SHEBA (V.0.)
I told him I’d speak to the Deputy Head, look
into his timetable.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Sheba with Ted Mawson. Kids streaming past between lessons.
TED
If we started pulling strings for one child
the whole system would unravel.
SHEBA
But he’s talented, he’s actually found
something he believes in!

TED
ch, they’re all talented!

CUT BACK TO:

EXT. PUB - EVENING
Sheba and Barbara at their table. Barbara looks steely-

BARBARA
You’d found your ‘gem’ as Sue would say?

SHEBA .
I said I’d teach him after school, but only if
he felt like it. It’s our job, isn’t it?

BARBARA |
Within specified hours and a specified
curriculum.
SHEBA
He came every day for two weeks. Yes, i was
flattered but more than that I was excited to
find someone who actualiy wanted to learn.

BARBARA
But you must’ve suspected his motives?

INT. ART STUDIO - DAY
Sheba showing Steven a book of Da Vinci’s drawings-

SHEBA (V.0.)
I sensed he had a little crush on me but so
what? It was innocent.

STEVEN
So he invented a sort of helicopter five
hundred years ago? Does your brain in.

Sheba smiles, charmed by him.

ANOTHER DAY: Steven’s new drawing of his hands. A slight
improvement.

SHEBA
That’s so much better. Look, you’ve absolutely
got that knuckle.

STEVEN
(grins )
Nailed it.

She’s pleased for him and ruffles his hair. Mistake. She
knows it instantly.

STEVEN
Do that again, Miss.

SHEBA
Don’t be silly. off you go-

She gets up, starts tidying, pushing chairs under desks. He
leaps up to help her.

STEVEN
What you having for tea, Miss?

SHEBA
I don’t know, I’11 probably buy something on

the way home.
STEVEN
Are you a good cook?

SHEBA
Not really.

STEVEN
You suck?

Pause. She narrows her eyes.

SHEBA
Go home, Steven.

He stares at her and then leaves. Sheba puts on her coat.
BARBARA (V.0.)
That’s when you should've stopped it.
INT. OUTSIDE SPORTS HALL - DAY

SHEBA (V.0.)
I did! I told him I wouldn’t teach him
anymore.

Busy lobby area. Sheba comes out of a meeting, carrying
papers and files.

Steven, in sports kit, suddenly throws her a football.

STEVEN
Miss!

Sheba catches it and sternly hands it back to him.
SHEBA (V.O.)

He wouldn’t accept it. He just kept coming
back.

EXT. STREET - ANOTHER DAY

Sheba cycling home. She passes Steven in the street. He gazes
at her.

SHEBA (V.0.)
It began to feel like ‘our secret’. And
secrets can be seductive...
EXT. DELICATESSEN/STREET - ANOTHER DAY

Sheba comes out with a bag of shopping. Steven is polishing
her saddle with his sleeve. He finishes with a flourish and
stands back gesturing for her to alight.

She dumps her bag in the bike basket.

SHEBA
What are you doing here?

STEVEN
I live here.

He gestures to the tower blocks of a grim looking estate.
STEVEN
‘S’‘alright, apart from the crack’eads and
that. Some bloke got stabbed last week-

Sheba looks concerned. He steadies the bike as she fiddles
with the chunky lock.

SHEBA
I’m going now. Good day to you, young man.

STEVEN
D’you wanna come for a walk?

SHEBA
Absolutely not! I‘m going home to my family.
As should you.
She climbs on the bike. He’s still holding the handlebars.
STEVEN
My Dad’s got the hump. He got sacked, been
taking it out on me.
He gestures with his arm, Sheba looks shocked.

SHEBA
He hits you?

Steven vaguely nods, embarrassed-

SHEBA
Does your mother know?

 

_ a
She looks at
face.

STEVEN
(shakes head)
She's got this kidney problem, been waiting
months for an operation. I don’t wanna give
her more grief.

SHEBA
You could call the Social Services. They’11
come and see him, give him a warning.

STEVEN
(shrugs)
I’11 be alright.

SHEBA
If he does it again you tell me, OK?

STEVEN
Thanks, Miss.

him, full of sympathy. He leans in and holds her
STEVEN

You're beautiful, Miss. You don’t know how
beautiful you are.

Before she can respond he’s on his way.

EXT. PUB.

Barbara looks at Sheba reproachfully.

SHEBA
(desperately explaining)
My heart went out to him...he was so
vulnerable. I knew it was wrong and immoral
and completely ridiculous but...I don’t
know...I just...allowed it to happen.

BARBARA
The boy is fifteen!

SHEBA
But he’s quite mature for his age.

BARBARA
‘But’ is not a helpful word here! He’s a minor
and you’ve broken the law.

Sheba nods, chastened, Pupil to teacher.
SHEBA
This’1l sound sick but something in me
felt...entitled.
INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

Between lessons. Staff and pupils coming in and out of
classrooms.

SHEBA (V.0.)
I’ve been good ali my adult life; decent wife,
dutiful mother, coping with Ben...
Steven passes Sheba in the crush of bodies, he slips her a
handwritten note.

INT. ART STUDIO — LATER

Sheba struggling to control her class as they splatter each
other with paint.

SHEBA (V.0.)
This voice inside me was going, ’why shouldn’t
you be bad?
She sits at her desk and reads the note: ‘MEET ME AT 8
TONIGHT. PLEASE.’ His mobile number is scrawled below it.
INT. SHEBA’S HOUSE, SITTING ROOM/HALL - THAT EVENING.
Sheba in an armchair with a glass of wine.
SHEBA (V.O.)
‘Why shouldn’t you transgress? You've earned
the right.’

Ben is watching TV with Richard. Sheba checks her watch:
7.45.

She stares at her husband and son. She decides. She gets up,
ruffles Ben’s hair, kisses him on the top of the head.

SHEBA
Sue phoned, OK if I go for a drink?

RICHARD
Sure. I‘1l put bugalugs to bed.

He tickles Ben as Sheba goes out into the Hall.

a0
4

She checks herself in the mirror.

Polly emerges from the kitchen talking intensely on her
mobile. Sheba flinches, somehow feeling ‘caught’.

SHEBA
I’m just going for a drink, with Sue.
Polly points to her phone ‘I’m busy’ - and slopes upstairs.
EXT. PUB.
BARBARA
Why Sue?

Sheba gulps her scotch, feeling the cold.

SHEBA
Dunno, first person I thought of.

On Barbara: disappointed.

EX£. RAILWAY ARCH - NIGHT

Sheba locks her bike to a railing. She makes her way to the
meeting place, giddy with anticipation.

SHEBA (V.0.)
I remembered that gorgeous feeling, like being
sixteen. I’m going to give you what you want
and you don’t know it yet.
Steven is waiting there, smoking.

STEVEN
Evening, Miss.

She looks him in the eye.

SHEBA
Have you done this before?

He nods but his cockiness is slightly diminished.
STEVEN
Not with someone like you, I mean...a proper

woman .

She touches his cheek, tenderly. They walk together.
EXT. DISUSED RAILWAY YARD ~ NIGHT

Sheba follows Steven down an ‘alley’ between a disused train
and a siding.

Steven stops. A clearing. He puts his coat down.

STEVEN
Make yourself comfortable.

He looks at Sheba, barely believing his luck.

SHEBA
It's incredibly important that we keep this
secret. Does anyone know you’re here?

STEVEN
No.

SHEBA
You can’t tell anyone, ever.

She stares at him. He takes her hand, soothes her...

STEVEN
Miss, I’m no genius but I aint no dickhead. I
wont tell anyone. You can trust me.

SHEBA
(distantly)
We'd both get into terrible trouble.

Steven looks into her eyes. She kisses him. They fall onto
the ground. They start making out like teenagers - laughter,
gasps and elbow banging.
SHEBA (V.O.)
It was easy. Like having another drink when
you know you shouldn’t.
Sheba and Steven fucking. Semi-clothed. It’s very quick.

STEVEN
Miss?

SHEBA
What?

He murmurs in her ear.

33
SHEBA
What?
(he murmurs again)
What?!
STEVEN

Can I come inside you?

SHEBA
Yes!

And he does. Sheba holds him tight.

LATER: Steven lies on her stomach. She strokes his hair. He
reaches for his cigarettes. Thinks.

STEVEN
Can I smoke, Miss?

SHEBA
You can do what you want. But enough of this
‘miss’.
He grins. Lights a fag, offer her one, she shakes her head.
Steven cracks open a can of beer and offers her the other.
She takes it and swigs some. He watches her intently.

STEVEN
Were you a model once?

Sheba shakes her head.

STEVEN
You shoulda been. You’re well fit.

SHEBA
“Gosh but don’t I know it’.

STEVEN
You're into ‘The Streets’?!

SHEBA
My daughter is.

STEVEN
She the same age as me?

SHEBA
None of your beeswax.

He’s smart enough not to persist.
STEVEN
Anyway, the point is you’re fit.

SHEBA
Well, so are you.

STEVEN
You reckon? My sister says I look like a
bollock with measles.
SHEBA
(shakes her head)
You’ve done my brain in.
They toast each other in the moonlight.
It’s freezing cold and they start to button up their clothes.
But Steven can’t bear to let her go, he stops her doing up
her shirt, kisses her.

STEVEN
You wanna do it again?

Sheba smiles. Men can’t do this.

STEVEN
What? What?

She laughs then sees he’s getting upset.

SHEBA
Yes. I want to do it again.

She pulls him towards her and feels his cock.
SHEBA
I want to do it again.
INT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

Sheba parks her bike in the hall. As she checks herself in
the mirror, an angry voice from the sitting room:

RICHARD (0.S.)
Oh, you TART! You feckless bitch!

Sheba freezes - then realizes he’s shouting at the TV.
She goes into the sitting room. Richard is slobbed out on the

sofa, remote control perched on his belly. He raises an arm
in greeting.
HI

RICHARD
I’m dying! These people are killing me! I’m
having a coronary right here on this sofa.

SHEBA
Coffee?
RICHARD
Love one. Add a vat of scotch will you?
(At TV)

ANSWER THE QUESTION! It’s ‘yes’ or ‘no’ you
dozy, old bastard!

SHEBA
(amused)
Change channels.
She goes in to the kitchen.
RICHARD
I keep flipping back. I'm in an orgy of
masochism.
Sheba starts making coffee.
The fridge with its collage of family photos and school
schedules. The clutter of family life...
EXT. PUB - NIGHT
Barbara stubs another cigarette out, she’s realized
something.

BARBARA
The day we met, it had already begun?

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR —- (FLASHBACK)

The ‘Homework Club’ day. Steven and Davis getting a dressing
down from Barbara as Sheba watches.

SHEBA (V.O-)
Yes.

BARBARA (V.0-)
you had further relations that day?
EXT. PUB-

Sheba thinks, truth is best policy here.
SHEBA
We went to the Art room.

BARBARA
Well, I’m glad I was such an aphrodisiac. I
was trying to help you.
SHEBA
And you did. I’m incredibly grateful. You've
been such a good friend.
BARBARA
(quietly)
Not reciprocated it seems.

Sheba suddenly sees that Barbara’s anger is personal ~— and
potentially explosive. She proceeds carefully...

SHEBA
I desperately wanted to confess to you. But
how could I? ...Barbara...?
She waits until Barbara looks at her.
SHEBA
It would've put you in an impossible
situation. But I so wish I had. You’d have
made me see sense.
Barbara considers, is Sheba ‘playing’ her? No, impossible.
They sit in silence. Barbara watches Sheba - then blinks:

BARBARA (V.0.)
And then I realized my fury had blinded me...

SHEBA
Do we need moxre drinks?

Barbara nods, miles away.

SHEBA
But can we go inside? I’m freezing.

BARBARA (V-.0O.)
There was a magnificent opportunity here...
INT. PUB -— MOMENTS LATER

Sheba at the bax, Barbara at a table.

Yo
43

BARBARA (V.O.)
With stealth I might secure the prize, long
texm, forever in my debt...

Sheba heads back to Barbara carrying the new drinks.

BARBARA (V-0.)
I could gain everything. By doing... nothing.

Sheba sits, fraught with anxiety. Barbara lights a cigarette.

SHEBA
I..-I know you have to tell them; the head,
the school, whoever. All I ask is you wait
‘til the new year? I’m begging you, please,
let me have this christmas with my family...?

She’s almost in tears. Barbara stares at her. Then smiles.

BARBARA
I think you’ve misunderstood me.
(beat)
I'm your friend. We’re friends.

SHEBA
I know. Of course. But...

BARBARA
Oh, you poor thing, have you got yourself ina
terrible state? I’m not going to report you. I
only want to help you, to support you through
this.

She gives Sheba a tender squeeze on the hand.

SHEBA
You’re not going to tell?

Barbara shakes her head. Sheba is overcome with relief.

SHEBA
You won't tell anyone?

BARBARA
Who would it benefit? Not you nor the boy and
certainly not the school. No. It’s a private
matter and we must keep it so0-

SHEBA
Yes — maybe I should resign?
BARBARA
No, no, no! That might alert suspicion. You
must stay at the school but the affair has to
end.
(Sheba nods)
Immediately. Your solemn promise. I can’t help
you unless you promise.

Sheba realizes that Barbara means it literally.
SHEBA
I - I promise.
BARBARA
Will it be difficult?
Sheba stares into her glass.
SHEBA
He’ll be very upset. He comes from such

a...loveless home.

BARBARA
You’re not in love?

Sheba looks up, an innocent. She gives a slight nod. Barbara
tries not to react but is clearly shocked.

SHEBA

I know it’s appalling and illegal and
unethical but I’m hopelessly besotted.

Barbara looks vaguely sick.
SHEBA
Sorry. When you’re in love you want to tell
the whole world about it.

BARBARA
I wouldn’t though.

They manage to share a grim smile.

BARBARA .
But isn’t it..-just a physical thing, mainly?

 

SHEBA
Well...
(raises an eyebrow)
I can’t tell you.

BARBARA
I think you just have.

GY
Ys

SHEBA
Do you know what I’m talking about?

BARBARA
Well, I’ve read quite a bit of D.H.Lawrence.

EXT. PUB/STREET - LATER
Barbara and Sheba walking.

BARBARA (V.0.)
I played the maiden aunt but I’m well aware of
the proclivities of the fifteen year old male.
Even I have been the subject of their
graffitied yearnings in the school toilets. By
law they are children, but their grim, pungent
urges are entirely adult...

They arrive at Barbara’s car.

BARBARA
So you'll tell him straight after Christmas?

Sheba nods, determinedly.

BARBARA
All for the best.

SHEBA
I know. Thank you so much. You've been so
brilliant.

BARBARA
And you’ll tell me when it’s done?

SHEBA
Yes.

A big hug. Then, Sheba sees the travelling cat box on the
passenger seat. Portia is asleep.

SHEBA
You never said...

BARBARA
Standard issue for spinsters.
(frowns )
She’s been off her food recently, I’m a bit
worried about her...
SHEBA
There’s a terrific vet up the read, he was
great with Ben’s rabbit.

Barbara lingers, relishing this time with Sheba.

BARBARA
Have you got many people coming tomorrow?
SHEBA
Mmm, my lot, Richard’s lot - including first
wife.
They share a grimace.
BARBARA
And your mother?
SHEBA
oh yes.
A second grimace.
BARBARA
Well, Happy Christmas.
SHEBA
¥ou too. And thank you.
BARBARA

Courage mon brave!
Barbara gets in her car.

BARBARA (V.0.)
And bon voyage to her little leprechaun.

Barbara drives off as Sheba heads back to her house.
BARBARA (V.0.)
Sheba and I share a deep understanding now.
INT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Sheba composes herself in the hall and then goes into the
sitting room.

BARBARA (V.O.)
No one can violate our magnificent complicity.

Richard is wrapping a present. He turns with the ineptly
wrapped package, taunts her with it.

Ylo
RICHARD
Ha!

She tries to steal it from him.

RICHARD
Don’t snatch! Wait ‘til tomorrow!

He chucks the present under the Christmas tree.

RICHARD
You’ve been gone ages.

SHEBA
oh, Barbara was...just some school thing.

He pours some wine for them.

SHEBA
fow’s his nibs?

RICHARD
Still awake, madly excited, I said he could
wait up for you.

SHEBA
And her ladyship?

RICHARD
(points upstairs)
‘Depressed’. Pete phoned. They had a barney,
he’s not coming tomorrow.
They share a moment of parental sadness-

SHEBA
Do you think he’s bad news?

RICHARD
Well, these older men can be very dodgy.

She smiles, suddenly kisses him, passionately. Richard is
slightly surprised but responds in kind.
INT. POLLY’‘S BEDROOM - LATER.

Polly is lying on her bed, i-Pod on, smoking. She's been
crying. Sheba sits with her.

POLLY
Bid Daddy tell you?
Sheba nods.

POLLY
Re’s gonna bin me, I know it.

SHEBA
You’re very lovely and he’s clever enough to
appreciate it.

POLLY
i’m fat as fuck, mum.

SHEBA
He’ll be back.

POLLY
ZI can’t live without him.

Sheba holds her. The girl resists a little but then succumbs -
grateful for the contact.

EXT. GRAND HOTEL, EASTBOURNE — CHRISTMAS DAY

Establishing Shot. The sea. The promenade.

The white stuccoed Regency hotel.

Sounds of festive music from a jazz combo.

INT. DINING ROOM - SAME TIME

A huge ornate room packed with the elderly, the infirm and
their families. A smali band playing on a raised area.

Barbara surveys the room: an old man spilling his soup, an
old woman tottering in on her crutches, an elderly couple
struggling to pull their cracker.

She's mid~lunch with her family: her sister, MARJORIE, with
husband, DAVE, also their daughter LORRAINE and her husband
MARTIN. They all wear paper hats,

Barbara is deep in thought, ruminating on Sheba...

BARBARA (V.0.)
Her fetish for the boy was simply her snobbery
manifested; ‘he’s working class and he likes
Art’. Bs if he were a monkey who’d just
strolled out of the rain forest and asked for
a gin and tonic.

eee
a

She straightens her paper crown, oblivious to everything.

DAVE
Ba! Wakey wakey!

MARJORIE
Lorraine was asking if you’d heard from that
nice friend of yours?

BARBARA
(confused)
Who?

LORRAINE
Jennifer.

BARBARA
Oh...yes. She left the school, she’s teaching
at a Primary in Stoke. There’s a chap
apparently. I heard they’re engaged.

Lorraine and Martin stifle a giggle but Barbara’s seen it.
She bides her time...

BARBARA
How's your eczema, Martin?

He shakes his head, a sad look in his eyes.
MARTIN
Bit grim. But Lorraine's found this top
specialist in Hastings.
LORRAINE
He’s state of the art. He'll give it a really
good bash in the new year.
She puts an arm round her disconsolate husband. Barbara
eyeballs the hapless couple.
BARBARA
It must be so distressing - for both of you.

Marjorie squeezes her son in law’s crusty hand.

MARJORIE
You’ve been in my prayers all year.

BARBARA
Fingers crossed for a Christmas miracle.
DAVE
(raises his glass)
And so say all of us!

INT. KITCHEN, SHEBA’S HOUSE - SAME TIME
In contrast: noise, hubbub and mayhem. Booze, food, mess.

Round the big table: Richard, Polly, Ben. Richard's first
wife MARCIA and their daughters SASKIA and CLAIRE. Sheba‘s
older brother EDDIE with his WIFE and their infant BoYs.

Sat next to Ben, Sheba‘s MOTHER (MRS TAYLOR) ~ a formidable
woman in her sixties.

Sheba gets up, gives Polly a little squeeze then fetches more
cream from the fridge.

Her mobile beeps, a text message. She reads: ‘happyxmas miss!
wish i woz fucking u blind rite now’

Sheba looks around - her mother is watching her. She deletes
the message and turns off the phone.

INT. SHEBA'S HOUSE - EVENING

Sheba outside the half open sitting room door with a tray of
coffees. Sheba’s mother is sat with Marcia.

MRS TAYLOR
Her father was an exceptional man.
Exceptional. Bathsheba’s a loner I'm afraid.
She’s beautiful (thank God) - and it’s got her
through —- but it’s not quite the same as
possessing substance.

Sheba listening in horror.

MARCIA
Mmm, strong personality, weak character.

MRS TAYLOR
She's a time bomb, actually. Non~bonders are
always dangerous -

Marcia nods, knowingly. Sheba is really stung. But she goes
in with the tray.

The women smile as she serves them theix coffec.
EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - EVENING

Sheba comes out the front door and down the steps with two
black bin bags crammed full of rubbish.

As she’s stuffing the bags into the front bins:

STEVEN
Happy Christmas.

Steven is lurking near the car. He hands her a little
package. Sheba glances at the house ~ the front door is open.

SHEBA
Everyone’s inside! Please, you have to go!

STEVEN
Aren’t you gonna open it?

She quickly opens the package,

STEVEN
It’s made of real fake gold.

It’s a cheap, gold necklace with an ‘S’ on it. It glints in
her hand. She’s touched by the gesture.

SHEBA
Thank you.

STEVEN
What’s up? I haven’t heard from you...

She motions him back to the side of the house where it’s
hidden from the front door.

SHEBA
I - I can’t see you anymore - I’m sorry - I’m
really sorry.
She’s beside herself. He pulls her towards him.

SHEBA
I can’t, it’s over.

STEVEN
Why?

RICHARD (0.S.)
Bash?!
They freeze. Richard’s legs appear above them at the top of
the outside stairs. Then a bag of rubbish.

RICHARD
Bash?
(To someone inside)
She’s not here!

Richard dumps the bag on the doorstep, groaning a bit with
drunk exhaustion.

RICHARD
Oh, sod it.

He goes inside closing the front door behind him.
STEVEN
(innocently)
Was that your Dad?
Sheba is stunned.

SHEBA
No. He...he’s my uncle...

She stares at Steven. Lost. He returns her gaze.

STEVEN
D’you wanna end it?

SHEBA
I - I ~ don’t look at me like that.

STEVEN
Have you gone off me?

SHEBA
No - I - you should go. Please.
Don’t...just...you have to go now.
He strokes her cheek, she catches his hand.

SHEBA
It’s stupid.

He gives her a slight grin.

SHEBA
Go away.

He shakes his head-

Joe

53

SHEBA
Go.

She struggles with herself. He kisses her and she suddenly
responds. She clenches the necklace.
INT. HOUSE ~ MINUTES LATER

Sheba comes in and nearly bumps into Polly who’s heading
upstairs - she’s on her mobile.

SHEBA
Is it him?

Polly nods happily and climbs the stairs, still talking.
Sheba watches her daughter go ~ natural teenage love.

Sheba goes into the kitchen, contemplates the necklace. One

of Eddie’s kids runs in. Sheba stuffs the necklace into her

pocket. The boy runs out with the plastic cup he was looking
for.

Sheba loads dirty crockery into the dishwasher.

Family noises from the sitting room.

She takes out a sachet of detergent, opens it with her teeth.
She stares at the hard tablet, the little ball in its centre.

She breaks down, knelt at the machine, retching with sobs.
BARBARA (V.0.)
I long to phone ’S’ but it’s late.
INT. SPARE ROOM, MARJORIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Barbara at a little dressing table writing her journal.

BARBARA (V.0O.)
Poor girl, all alone with her awful family.

Above her a framed silkscreen print of ‘The Last Supper’.
Portia lies on the bed, whimpering a little.

BARBARA (V.0.)
Our lives are acutely similar in so many
respects.

A knock at the door. Barbara annoyed at the interruption.
MARJORIE (0-.S.)
Sis?

Marjorie comes in wearing her nightie. Sees Portia, coos at
her and then strokes the cat as an excuse to enter.

MARJORIE
Writing the old diary? I can’t imagine how you
keep at it. I'd have nothing to say.

Marjorie sits on the bed, settling in for a sisterly chat.
MARJORIE

You know you’re welcome whenever you want? Not
just once a year.

BARBARA
It’s just...I’m rather busy at the moment.
MARJORIE
Your racy London life. I’m glad it’s so full.
(pause)

I’m sorry about Jennifer. She was lovely.

Barbara flinches a touch.

MARJORIE
Is there anyone else...someone else who's
special?
Silence.
BARBARA

I don’t know what you mean.

MARJORIE
I didn’t mean to pry-

Barbara stares her out.

MARJORIE
Well, Good-night.

BARBARA
To you too.

Marjorie goes. Barbara reflects, a stab of regret.

EXT. RATLWAY YARD - NIGHT
Sheba and Steven, half dressed, fucking like horny rabbits.

ot

sate nim
se

They lie in each others arms. Steven toys with the 'S’
necklace, happy she’s wearing it.
INT. PIZZA EXPRESS — DAY
Barbara and Sheba with menus. Barbara glances over hers,
catches Sheba’s eye.
BARBARA
Are we ladies who lunch?

SHEBA
I think we must be.

Barbara twinkles with delight.

SHEBA
Oh, belated Christmas present.

She takes a beautifully wrapped package out of her bag.

BARBARA
Thank you! Shall I open it?

SHEBA
silly not to.

Barbara unwraps it, savouring the ribbons, cooing over the
smart wrapping paper.

BARBARA
Oh my word, Asprey.

She takes out a sterling silver photo frame engraved with the
name ‘Portia’.

Barbara can barely speak, just nods in gratitude.

SHEBA
How is she?

Barbara shakes her head, Sheba gives her a consoling squeeze.
BARBARA
You‘re the most wonderful friend.
INT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

Sheba and steven lying, post-coital on the sofa.
SHEBA
Don’t fall asleep.

He opens his eyes, looks around.

STEVEN
Bit close to home, isn’t it?

SHEBA
Well, Little Lord Fauntleroy complained of
brambles up his arse.

He grins, thinks, animal instinct at work.

STEVEN

Yeah...but d’you wanna get caught?
SHEBA

No!
STEVEN

Course you do. Trash it all.

SHEBA
Why would I want to do that?

He's not sure he wants to explore this, jokes instead:

STEVEN
So you can be with me.

She digs him in the ribs.

SHEBA
You’re cocky.

STEVEN
You love it.

He gently disengages from her arms, gets up, looks around,
exploring her territory.

He turns back, she’s deep in thought, considering what he’s
suggested...

STEVEN
I was only making conversation. It’s polite to
talk after sex, so’s I don’t feel like a slut.

He wanders over to her record collection. Sheba pulls on her
sweater and comes over to him. He’a looking at ‘Kaleidoscope’

by Siouxsie and the Banshees.

awe
St

STEVEN
Any good?

SHEBA
It’s a masterpiece. Don’t they teach you
anything?
Sheba strokes his naked back, stares at the record cover.
SHEBA
We used to worship her...we were children
...she made us feel invincible...
She’s sixteen again. Lost in the memory of it.
Steven wanders over to her work table. There’s a half
completed wizard’s hat on it. He tries it on. A comical
figure in his pants, socks and pointed hat.
SHEBA
(smiling)
Take it off.

STEVEN
What’s it for?

SHEBA
Take it off, please. I’m still making it.

STEVEN
Yeah but why?

SHEBA
It’s for my son.

STEVEN
But he’s twelve, isn‘t he?

SHEBA
He’s got Down's Syndrome.

Pause.

STEVEN
You never said. Sorry.

He takes the hat off, puts it back on the table.

Sheba turns away not wanting to burden him with her sadness -

He looks at her, suddenly knows he’s way out of his depth.
INT. KITCHEN — SATURDAY MORNING

Barbara saunters in carrying her shopping. She stops short,
horrified.

Portia is lying on the floor in a pool of urine and vomit.

INT. VET’S SURGERY - LATER
The vet has just told Barbara the news.

VET
I’m sure she’s had a very happy life.

BARBARA
Oh, yes. She has. Thank you.

She strokes Portia as the vet continues to talk.

INT. SHEBA’S KITCHEN — LATER

Barbara sat at the table, tears in her eyes. Sheba plies her
with scotch.

SHEBA
You’ve had a terrible shock.

Barbara drinks some more.

BARBARA
Where’s Richard? I don’t want to disturb your
weekend.

SHEBA

It’s fine, everyone’s out.

Sheba’s mobile rings. They both stare at it. Sheba presses
‘BUSY’ - looks a touch anxious.

SHEBA
Can they treat her?

BARBARA
He says it’s a matter of weeks...

She’s recovering now, embarrassed by her tears.

BARBARA
Oh, she’s only a pet.
SHEBA

57

I cried for weeks when our dog died. Weeks!

BARBARA
One does get so attached.

Barbara dries her eyes with a tissue.

BARBARA
I should leave you in peace...

Not what Barbara wants but Sheba stands to facilitate it.

SHEBA
Yuh, well...

She’s in a tight t-shirt, arms bare. Her ‘S’

mecklace on.

Barbara gazes ~ takes in Sheba’s make-up: red lips, dark eye

liner - an echo of her youth.

BARBARA

I like that top. It suits you.
SHEBA

Oh, thanks.

Sheba edges to the door, hinting. But Barbara
speaks very softly...gently...

Sheba closes her eyes, knowing this is ‘the deal’.

 
Barbara holds Sheba’s hands in hers and then stretches out
her arms, palms upwards.

BARBARA
Good.

Barbara begins to gently run her fingertips along Sheba’s
bare forearms. Up and down.

Sheba is in a silent rictus of embarrassment.

Barbara continues. All the while gazing at Sheba’s face, her
breasts beneath the tight t-shirt, her arms...

BARBARA
There's a good girl.

Sheba opens her eyes, tries to remain polite...

SHEBA
I think that’s enough.

BARBARA
Close your eyes.

SHEBA
(firmly)
I really think that’s enough, Barbara.

She stares her out. Barbara stands her ground but is wretched
with humiliation.

But now her focus changes from Sheba’s face to over her
shoulder:

BARBARA
There's someone in your garden!

She points through the French windows. Sheba turns. At the
foot of the garden a FIGURE jumps down from the back wall and
slips into the Summer House.

BARBARA
A thief - he came over the wall!

SHEBA
Oh - it’ll be one of the neighbours’ boys,
lost his ball.

Sheba knows it’s Steven - prays he stays put.
BARBARA
No, he’s gone into your summer house - quick,
phone the police!

SHEBA
It’s just a kid from next door, forget it!

Sheba’s mobile rings again. They both stare at it - Sheba
paralysed - and now Barbara twigs it. She snatches the phone
and answers:

STEVEN (V.0.)
Where are you? I want your hot, sweet cunt
right now!

Barbara listens, sickness rising in her. She hands the phone
to Sheba.

SHEBA (IN PHONE)
Richard just called, he’s on his way - I can’t
- I’1l call you.

As she speaks Barbara collects her bag and storms to the
front door, Sheba sprints after her.

SHEBA
Barbara!
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
Barbara’s heading for her car, Sheba catches up.
SHEBA
I’m sorry, Ba. I tried to end it, honestly, I -
I just couldn’t!
Barbara fumbles for her car keys, fighting back tears.
BARBARA
I risked everything for you and in return you
humiliate me.
SHEBA
I - I - didn’t mean to upset you. Please - I
need your help more than ever now - pleage,
don‘t go!

Barbara opens the car door.

BARBARA .
You promised you’d end it, why didn’t you?
Sheba is too

SHEBA
Because...

BARBARA

(witheringly)

You’re ‘in love’?

SHEBA
I-I-

BARBARA

And the child? Do you imagine he reciprocates
your soppy ‘feelings’? Oh I dare say he’s
fascinated by the neurotic compulsions of a
middle class lady with marital problems!

SHEBA
Ba-

BARBARA
There’s nothing crueller than the adolescent
boy, I know them! Once he’s had his fill he’ll
discard you like an old rag -

SHEBA
Ba-

BARBARA
- and revert to rutting with schoolgirls. YOU
ARE NOT YOUNG!
(beat)
I say this to help you.

stunned to respond.

BARBARA
End it now.

SHEBA
Erm...yes - I - I’m thinking...

BARBARA
Don’t think - DO! Do! DO! bo!
(beat)
Or shall I sit here polishing my nails until
your husband returns?

SHEBA
No ~ no - please - I’ll do it, I promise.

BARBARA
So what are you waiting for?

Barbara gets in her car and drives off.

EXT. STREET - TEN MINUTES LATER

Sheba on her bike, speeding towards Steven’s home.

EXT. COUNCIL ESTATE.
Sheba gets off her bike, starts pushing it.

To her surprise it’s a clean street, well kept blocks and
houses. Not the sink estate she’d imagined - or been told of.

Kids riding around on bikes. She asks them if they know
Steven Connolly. They point her in the right direction.

She finds his home - not the tower block but an ordinary
Maisonette. She rings the bell.

MR CONNOLLY opens the door. He’s a slight man without an
ounce of aggression in him. She’d expected tattoos and
brutality.

SHEBA
Mr Connolly? I’m Mrs Hart, from St George’s -
Steven’s not in trouble. I just need to see
him about...an art project and I was in the
area S80...

MR CONNOLLY
(amiably)
of course, come in, come in!

He shows her in.

MR CONNOLLY
Very good of you to give him these extra

lessons.
(calls upstairs)
Steve! Visitor!

He’s holding a remote control. He gestures into the sitting
room where there’s a massive TV set, the screen image paused.

MR CONNOLLY

I’m watching ‘Amelie’.
(nods, moved)
Have you seen it?

Sheba shakes her head.
MR CONNOLLY
(calls up)
Steve! Mrs Bart’s here!
(To Sheba)
Probably on his mobile, usually is. Why don't
you go up? First door on the right, probably
best to knock.

He goes back into the front room.

Sheba climbs the stairs. The house is spotless. Framed school
photos line the walls and there are family shots of Steven
with his parents and two sisters.

She finds his bedroom door. It says ‘STEVE’S GAFF’ in letters
cut out from different magazines - punk style-

She hears his voice, knocks and goes in. He’s astonished.

STEVEN (IN PHONE)
Call you back, OK? Laters.

They look at each other.

Sheba takes in the adolescent room, shocked at its
‘childishness’: the music posters, football paraphernalia,
the kid’s duvet and strewn clothes.

EXT. COUNCIL ESTATE —- MINUTES LATER
Sheba pushing her bike. Steven smoking, edgy-

SHEBA
So that’s your vicious father?

STEVEN
(shrugs)
You wanted a sob story, I gave it you. Made
you feel like Bob Geldof.

SHEBA
You lied to me!

STEVEN
Oooh, sorry, Miss. D’you prefer it if T lived
in a shit’ole?

SHEBA
And your mother?
STEVEN
(sniffs)
I think she’s gonna pull through. What d‘you
want, what you doing here?

And now she has to tell him.

EXT. PLAYAREA/COUNCIL ESTATE — LATER

Steven sits on a swing, flicking at his fag in fury.

STEVEN
They’re gonna expel me now!
SHEBA
No they won’t. I’1l get the blame if she
tells.
STEVEN
As if she won't?
SHEBA
She likes me, she might not.
STEVEN
Likes you how? Like ‘that’? You giving her one
‘n’ all?
SHEBA
(snaps)

Why are you being so cruel? Why, Steven?
He’s chastened. He swings slowly to and away from her.

STEVEN
I really like you. You’re a nice person and
you’ve been cool. And it's been great, OK?
But it was s'posed to be fun. Now it’s like
this serious thing. Whatever shit you’re
working out, you know; your husband, your kid,
you - I dunno...I can’t help you.

Sheba manages a smile. Determined not to show him her pain.

SHEBA
So you’re seeing someone else?

He looks at her, caught. Nods an apology. She stares at him.
A stab of intense jealousy.
SHEBA
So you just - what - you prefer her? Because
she’s young? Huh? Because she helps you with
your sums? What - because she’s so nice and
tight? I risked my whole life for you, you
little shit!

STEVEN
I never asked you to!

SHEBA
I taught. you how to fuck!

Sheba is powerfully conscious she’s out of control. She
clenches her fists, holds it in, fights back her tears.

STEVEN
Why are you so upset?

She can’t answer. He suddenly gets that she loves him. He
glances around.

STEVEN
I’d give you a hug but there’s people who know
me...
(pause)
I can't deal with this. I’m not old enough.
She’s overcome with guilt, tries to be practical.
SHEBA
Steven. Don’t be embarrassed at school. Ignore
Me, OK? You’re a sweet boy...and I‘ve loved
our time together. I’m sorry if I ever harmed
you.
He shakes his head.

STEVEN
You never.

They look at each other, tenderly. Then Sheba walks away.

INT/EXT. BARBARA'S CAR/STREET - THAT NIGHT
Barbara driving at speed. Her mood bas brightened...

She cuts up another car and hurtles along. She spots Sheba
outside Steven’s estate, a wan figure on the pavement.

Sheba gives her a sad little wave.

(lo
Barbara pulls in to the kerb and leaps out. Sheba comes to
her, face streaked with tears.

Barbara opens her arms. Forgiveness. They hug. Barbara
comforting Sheba - and herself in so doing.

BARBARA (V.O.)
As Ma would’ve said, ‘the boy done her like a
kipper’ .
INT. BARBARA'S FLAT - NIGHT
Barbara in her dressing gown, writing her journal.

mantelpiece. A photo of Portia inside it.

Sheba wraps the ‘S’ necklace in paper and puts it in the bin.
BARBARA (V.O.)
She mopes and mourns for her pubescent
paramour - often at punishing length.
INT. SCHOOL — DAY

First day of the new term. Barbara watching as Sheba comes in
the main entrance.

BARBARA (V.0.)

But she knows my interventions have saved her
life and she is sweetly grateful.

INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

Staff buzzing around, comparing their Christmases, moaning
about holidays not being long enough.

BARBARA (V.0.)
Her betrayal hurt me more than I dare show.

Barbara sat in her chair, Sheba comes in. They smile at each
other.
_, BARBARA (V.0.)
But I will forgive her and heal myself in
private.
INT. SUMMERHOUSE ~ NIGHT

Sheba carefully sticking a silver crescent onto Ben’s wizard
at.

BARBARA (V.0.)
She’s worth it, thie one. She's the one I’ve
waited for...
INT. LIBRARY, HOMEWORK CLUB - DAY
Barbara patrols the desks.
BARBARA (V.0O.)
At last she’s beginning to understand that her
dalliance with Master Connolly was a
consequence of her dead marriage.

She arrives at Steven’s desk. He keeps writing.

INT. RAF MUSEUM - DAY
An outing. Barbara walking with Sheba.
BARBARA (V.0.)
It‘s a sham - fuelled only by the memory of
former glories.

Richard and Ben are behind them looking at the aeroplanes.

INT. CANTEEN - LUNCHTIME
Sheba and Barbara sitting with their trays, talking.
BARBARA (V.0.)
Whereas we are going through the fire, forging
our friendship with a stronger bond each day.
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Barbara at her high window, watching Sheba lock up her
bicycle far below.

BARBARA (V.0.)
In fact, we are now entering a delicate new
phase...
EXT. ART STUDIO ~ DAY

Barbara approaches and sees Sheba inside.

BARBARA (V.O.)
We are silently and stealthily negotiating the
terms...of a life lived together.

Sheba sees Barbara and nods amiably.

INT. SHEBA’S KITCHEN — DAY

Sunday lunch. Barbara at the head of the table, making the
family laugh with some anecdote.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Now more than ever we are bound by the secrets
we share.
Ben snorts as Barbara makes a funny face.
BARBARA (V.0.)
I’m invited to drop in on them this summer. At

their house in the Dordogne. I might just do
that...

INT. BARBARA’S BEDROOM — NIGHT
Barbara sat up in bed, writing.
BARBARA (V.O.)
Though no rush. We’ll have plenty of time a
deux once she's left her family...
EXT. PARLIAMENT HILL - DAY

Barbara and Sheba on the bench seen at the beginning. They
share sandwiches.

BARBARA
Do try the prawn, it's delicious.

Raxrbara munches contentedly-

CT
BARBARA
I once sat here discussing Elgar. For three
hours.

SHEBA
God! Who with?

BARBARA
Oh, just a friend. Jennifer. This was our
haunt.

Sheba conceals her discomfort.

BARBARA
We were quite chummy for a while. But...the
poor thing suffered from this terrible
depression. I tried to help but she rather
unravelled. She became alarmingly. ..deluded.

SHEBA
Did she go to hospital?

BARBARA
No, she got a job in Stoke.

Sheba thinks, putting it all together...

SHEBA
When was this?

BARBARA
Last summer. I did what I could but she was
too far gone. Even so I feel I should’ve done
more...

SHEBA
I’m sure she knows you did your best...you’re
such a sensitive person.
Sheba pats Barbara’s shoulder, Barbara takes her hand.

BARBARA
One conceals it of course.

She turns to Sheba, vulnerable.
BARBARA
People languish for years with partners who
are clearly from another planet.

SHEBA
Mmm...
4]

BARBARA
We so want to believe we’ve found our ‘other’.
One needs courage to recognize the real as
opposed to the convenient.

SHEBA
Yes.

Barbara is still holding Sheba’s hand.
BARBARA
When I was young I had such a vision of
myself. I dreamt I’d be someone to be reckoned
with. You know, in...in the world.
(beat)
But one learns one’s scale.
Sheba squeezes Barbara’s hand. Barbara responds gratefully.

BARBARA
I’ve such a...dread...of ending my days alone.

SHEBA
Mmm. Well we all-

BARBARA
Though recently, I've allowed myself to
imagine I might not be...am I wrong?

SHEBA
Of course not.

Sheba gives Barbara a ‘loving’ hug. Barbara crumples in
gratitude.
EXT. VET’S SURGERY -~ DAY

Barbara rushes in, cradling the stricken Portia in her arms.

INT. VET’S SURGERY - DAY
The vet feels Portia’s tummy.

VET
Do you want to stay?

Barbara shakes her head.
VET
Sometimes people find it comforting to see
them at peace. Would you like to come back
++-in twenty minutes, to say good-bye?

EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Barbara comes out of the vets. A zombie on the busy street.

Then she remembers - Sheba lives nearby. She starts to hurry,
almost pushing people out of the way as she rushes to her
friend.

EXT. SHEBA’S STREET - MINUTES LATER

Barbara panting for breath, a broken woman desperately
needing comfort. She hurries towards Sheba’s house.

Suddenly ~ the Hart’s car comes out their driveway nearly
knocking her over. Richard is at the wheel, he parks up, the
car skewed on the road, engine running...

Ben and Polly are in the back. Barbara sees Polly groaning
comically, mockingly - and Ben (who holds his wizard hat) is
laughing at his sister’s antics. Sheba is shushing them.

Sheba sees Barbara is in great distress, says something to
Richard and gets out the car.

Barbara falls into her arms, sobbing.

SHEBA
Is it Portia? Oh no.

Richard gives Sheba a quizzical look from the car, ‘what’s
up’? Sheba grimaces, indicates this might take a while.

Richard exhales in frustration and points to his watch —
‘we're late’.

BARBARA
I have to go back to the vets...after it’s
done...will you come with me? I just can’t on
my own...

SHEBA
Oh, I - of course I would but...Ben’s doing
his play at his school and-

BARBARA
A play??

Tp
SHEBA
The - wizard thing, remember? We’re all going.
We're a bit late actually...

BARBARA
Someone has died!

SHEBA
I - = know...and ~ and it’s terribly sad.

Ben is banging on the car window. Richard shouts at Polly to
stop him. She shouts back. It’s mayhem in there.

BARBARA
You owe me this.

Richard revs the engine, Sheba turns, impossibly pulled in
both directions. Richard’s face - ‘We have to go’.

Ben looks anxiously from the car. Meanwhile, Barbara’s on the
turn, Sheba pleads:

SHEBA
He’s doing a show for the first time in his
life!

BARBARA

That's your choice is it?

SHEBA.
Look -— why - why don’t you come? You’re very
welcome...

Barbara doesn’t hear it.

BARBARA
I thought you understood what friendship
means .

SHEBA

He’s my child!
Richard honks the horn in frustration.

SHEBA
He’s my son, he’s just a little boy!

BARBARA
Don’t play the good mother with me.

Barbara cyes the car — a threat. But now Richard leaps out
and shouts across the bonnet.
RICHARD
Excuse me? Can one of you tell me what’s going
on? Is this some kind of coven?

BARBARA
(coolly)
Oh, I can explain perfectly. Would you like me
to?
SHEBA
(jumps in)

It’s just that Barbara’s had some very bad
news, about her cat.

RICHARD
(To Barbara)
My condolences. Poor, poor pussy! Now can I
have my wife back please?

BARBARA
(fixes him)
I don’t like your tone.

RICHARD
(fo Sheba)
Why is she always here? What fucking spell has
she cast on you?!

Polly pokes hex head out the car window.

POLLY
Ben’s getting really stressed! I think he’s
gonna blow!

RICHARD
(fo Sheba)
God‘s sake, woman, will you get in the bloody
car!

SHEBA
GIVE ME A MINUTE WILL YOU! I CAN HANDLE THIS!!

Richard storms back to the car.
BARBARA
Oh - oh ~ so I’m to be handled am I? Like
toxic waste. So you see me on sufferance? I’m
an imposition, to be tolerated!

Emergency! Sheba hugs Barbara.

+f
SHEBA
No! Of course not! I love our time together!
I’m your good, good friend.

BARBARA
Then stay with me.

SHEBA
I would if I could. And I’m desperately sorry
about Portia. But you know I have to go.

Sheba gently detaches herself. A moment of reckoning:
BARBARA
Think very carefully, madam. Be aware of the
consequences.

The car starts pulling away from the kerb, slowly making it’s
way up the road.

SHEBA

Please don’t make this mean more than it is!
BARBARA

I need you to stay. I don’t know what 1/11

do...
A herculean honk of the horn - and now Sheba runs for it.

SHEBA
I’1l phone you later! I promise!

Sheba gets in the car. Barbara watches it disappear down the
road.

BARBARA (V.O-)
They always let you down in the end...
EXT. BARBARA'S GARDEN — LATER
Barbara digging a hole in the ground with a small trowel.

She’s exhausted from the effort, has been sobbing for the
last hour. Her hands and arms are covered in soil.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Jennifer said I was ‘too intense’. Meaning
what exactly?

Barbara buries Portia’s body tightly wrapped in a blanket-
BARBARA (V.0.)
That I am loyal in my friendships?

Then she buries the cat toys and the cat bowl. And with a
grim last look - the Asprey frame from Sheba.

BARBARA (V.0.)
That I will go to the ends of the earth for
someone I admire?

She treads the earth down.

INT. BEN’S SCHOOL - SAME TIME

Ben’s little ‘play’. Audience of parents and relatives
watching their kids. Richard videos it.

Ben comes on in his wizard hat, waving a wand. Applause and
laughter. Sheba is powerfully moved. Polly holds her hand.
INT. SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTER-NOON

It’s getting dark outside. Barbara sat in her chair.

She’s still wearing her ‘gardening’ clothes. Dried mud on her
face and arms. She’s immobile, a statue in grief.

The door bell rings. She goes down the corridor - hoping it’s
Sheba come to apologize. She opens the door.

BRIAN
Not disturbing you, am I?

She shakes her head, still dazed by the day’s events.

BRIAN
It’s just...I need to talk to you about Mrs
Hart. Sheba.

BARBARA

Ah...
She looks at him, feels sure he knows something...

BRIAN
It’s a bit delicate. can I come in?

Barbara leads him into the kitchen.

BARBARA
Tea?

ee
a ~

BRIAN
Lovely, thanks.

She fetches milk and sugar. Brian hovers.

BRIAN
You haven’t got a biscuit?

Barbara produces a tin and hands it to him.

BRIAN
Cheers.

As he munches he notices the muddy trowel on a side table.

BARBARA
Would you like me to take your hat?

He removes his Tottenham Hotspur hat and scarf.
BRIAN
Been up the lane. White Hart Lane. Home of the
mighty Spurs.

BARBARA
Were you victorious?

BRIAN
Three nil! Jermaine Defoe - get in there!

He mock heads a ball.
BARBARA

My father supported Charlton Athletic. it
mever seemed to give him any pleasure.

Barbara prepares the tea.

BRIAN
Where’s the moggy?

BARBARA
She's dead.

Brian eyes the mud on her face and arms.
BRIAN
Oh, dear. My condolences. Ahhh. Is this not a

good time?

Barbara thinks. Then, a dark glint in her eye-
BARBARA
It’s a very good time.

They sit at the kitchen table.

BARBARA
Mrs Hart.

BRIAN
Yeah. Well...it’s just...erm...

BARBARA
Anything you tell me will be in strictest
confidence.

He nods, gratefully.

BRIAN
The thing is...I was wondering if she’s...ever
mentioned me?

Barbara’s eyes widen-

BRIAN
Does she ever...mention me?

BARBARA
Let me think...

She puts her fingers to her temples, a little theatrically.

BARBARA
No. Never.
(beat)
Actually - yes! She mentioned you’d invested
in a new shirt. I think it was last term.

BRIAN
Yeah, T lashed out at Nicole Farhi. The thing
is...over the last few months, ever since I
met her really, I’ve...

BARBARA
Brian, are you in love?

BRIAN
I’ve been a bit bloody obvious, haven’t I?

BARBARA
You’ve been utterly clandestine.

He senses she’s mocking him but can’t be sure.

48
BRIAN
So she mentioned the shirt then?

BARBARA
You do know she’s married?

BRIAN
Yeah but she’s quite flirty. You never know
with people, do you?

BARBARA
Indeed you don’t.

BRIAN
But I wouldn’t want to make a move if I’m
gonna get knocked back. What with staff
politics and the Head being such a stickler -—
you have to be really careful these days.

BARBARA
It’s a minefield.

BRIAN
So...would...do you think you could have a
word with her? suss the lie of the land?

BARBARA
You’d like me to ask Mrs Hart if she’s
inclined to commit adultery with you?

He looks at her - could not be more exposed. But she’s had
her fun and is tired of toying with him. To business:

BARBARA
I don’t want you te suffer more than is
necessary. No one should. I couldn’t possibly
speak for Mrs Hart but instinct tells me you
Might not be her type.

Brian nods, crestfallen. Then thinks...

BRIAN
She’s got a type then?

BARBARA
It’s no reflection on your attractiveness. But
I get the impression her preference is
for...the younger man. Surprisingly young.
(pause)
Boys, I’m told.

Brian absorbs the information.
BARBARA
Naturally she’s never discussed any of this
with me. But I’ve been hearing some rather
disturbing rumours that there’s one in
particular. Playground gossip, staff room
whispers and so on...

She’s alone now, turned away from him, as if he were
invisible. Or she in confession.

I think you might know the boy in question
..+.Steven Connolly.

BRIAN
Year Ten?

She nods, distantly. Brian stares at her, slow cogs whirring,
his moral outrage increasing with his jealousy.

Barbara turns to him now - as if none of this had been said.
BARBARA
I think the kettle’s boiled.
INT. BEN’S BEDROOM —- THAT NIGHT

Sheba tucking Ben in. His wizard’s hat sits on a bed post.
She brushes his hair from his face.

BARBARA (V-0.)
You say the words and it’s done. Easy.

Sheba kisses Ben good-night and turns out the light.

INT. BARBARA’S FLAT - SAME TIME

Barbara picking at her dinner in front of the TV, vaguely
watching the lottery show.

BARBARA (V.0.)
Judas had the grace to hang himself.

She goes to the kitchen, scrapes her scraps into the bin.
BARBARA (V.O.)

But only according to Matthew - the most
sentimental of the apostles.

90
INT. POLLY’S ROOM ~ LATER THAT NIGHT

Sheba tidying. She finds a pair of boxer shorts belonging to
Polly’s boyfriend.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Is this the last night of her old life?

Polly stands in the doorway having had a bath. Sheba holds up
the shorts, quizzically. Polly smiles.

INT. RICHARD’S STUDY - LATER

Richard hard at work. Sheba removes a finished mug of coffee
and sets down a new one. He strokes her hand.

BARBARA (V.0O.)
I wonder how long my messenger will take?

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
Barbara in the bath.

BARBARA (V.O.)
People like Sheba think they know what it is
to be lonely. But of the drip drip of long-
haul, no-end-in-sight solitude they know
nothing.

She draws on her cigarette.

BARBARA (V.C.)
What it’s like to construct an entire weekend
around a visit to the launderette. Or to be so
chronically untouched that the accidental
brush of a bus conductor’s hand sends a jolt
of longing straight to your groin.

INT, SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

Sheba alone on the sofa, thinking.

BARBARA (V.0.)
Of this, Sheba and her like have no clue.
INT. BARBARA’S BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM - SAME TIME

Barbara in bed. The phone is ringing but she doesn’t move.
The ansafone beeps and Sheba leaves her message.

SHEBA (V.0.)
Ba, I’m so sorry about today. It was an
impossible situation. Richard feels dreadful
too. You must be so upset. Poor you. Poor
Portia. Call me as late as you like. Let’s not
fall out, come to dinner tomorrow night, OK?

Barbara listens, guilty but resolved.

INT. SITTING ROOM, SHEBA’S HOUSE - EVENING

Coffee after dinner. Richard lies on a sofa, feet on Sheba’s
lap. She idly strokes his calves. Not a sight Barbara enjoys
as she sits across from them, nervously smoking.

RICHARD
Actually, I write quite quickly, it’s the
thinking that takes an eternity.
(sighs)
You're never satisfied; when I’m lecturing I
long for time to write and when I’ve got it I
yearn to be back with the students.

From her seat Barbara has a view of the front path. She sees
a WOMAN in her mid-thirties jump out of a car and come
storming up to the front door.

Barbara watches Sheba, her last moments before the
calamity...

SHEBA
More coffee, anyone?

RICHARD
I’1ll have a slug, please.

SHEBA
Barbara?

BARBARA
No, thank you.

The woman has now established that the bell makes no sound.
She starts to bang on the door. Richard looks at Sheba —
‘who's that?’ Sheba shrugs ‘dunno’.

sx

en et te
Richard opens the door. A big Irish voice, full volume:

MRS CONNOLLY
Are you her husband?

RICHARD
What? Whose?

MRS CONNOLLY
Don’t you fuck with me Mister, don’t you dick
Mme around! WHERE IS SHE? Tell her Steven
connolly’s mother wants to see her right Now!

Mrs Connolly forces her way in.

RICHARD
Hey, hey, excuse me!

He tries to grab hold of her but she lashes out catching him
across the face. He exclaims in pain.

Sheba comes out into the hall and Mrs Connolly lunges at her,
kicking, punching, scratching, screaming.

MRS CONNOLLY
Ya slut! Ya fuckin‘ whore! How could you! He's
only a child! My little boy is a CHILD!

Richard and Barbara manage to pull her off but she’s strong
and hurls herself at Sheba again, grasping her hair.

A struggle. Barbara and Richard plant themselves between the
two women — keeping them apart in the tight hallway.

RICHARD
What the hell is going on! Will you just stop
and calm down for one second, please! PLEASE!

MRS CONNOLLY
You ask your wife what’s going on. ASK HER! Ya
perverted bitch!

She manages to whack Sheba once more as MR CONNOLLY appears
in the front doorway. A sad, quiet figure.

MR CONNOLLY
Come on. Leave them alone.

He stares at Sheba with contempt.

MR CONNOLLY
There’s nothing here for us.
He leads his weeping wife down the path back to the car.

Richard closes the front door. Sheba sits at the foot of the
stairs, tears streaming.

Richard stares at her, horribly confused...

Polly appears at the top of the stairs. Followed by Ben in
his pyjamas. Polly’s voice, taut with vulnerability.

POLLY
What’s happening. .?

Barbara looks at Sheba who gives her a weak nod. Barbara
climbs the stairs to deal with the children.

INT. LANDING/SITTING ROOM - LATER

Barbara sat on the stairs with a partial view of the sitting
room - where Richard and Sheba are in meltdown.

BARBARA (V.0.)
By the time I took my seat in the Gods, the
opera was well into its final act...

SHEBA
It just happened. It just happened!

RICHARD
Things don’t just - people make them happen.
You think you’re the only one who’s ever
wanted someone young? Everyone - sometimes —
everyone thinks about it. But they don’t act
on it, they deal with it!

SHEBA
When you met me I was-—

RICHARD
You were an adult it’s not the same! You're
his teacher!

SHEBA
And you were mine! I’m not justifying, I’m not
saying-

RICHARD

Oh, you're so full of shit! It’s totally
different, you were TWENTY!
SHEBA
He’ll be sixteen in May! He’s not some
innocent.

RICHARD
Of course he’s innocent - he’s FUCKING
FIFTEEN! Are you INSANE?!

Barbara lights another cigarette ~ a casual spectator.

RICHARD
If you meant to destroy us why not do it with
an adult? That’s the convention, it’s worked
for centuries.

SHEBA
It wasn’t about us.
RICHARD
This boy—
SHEBA

I told you, it’s over.

He holds his head in pain.

RICHARD
why?

SHEBA
I...-just wanted him.

RICHARD
Why?

SHEBA

I don’t know!
RICHARD
WELL FIND out!
EXT. SCHOOL — DAY

A Police car waits outside the gates.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR — DAY

Gita with TWO POLICE OFFICERS, they head for Pabblem’s
office, School kids pass by, curious.
INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

Teachers gossiping as the rumours spread.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR ~ DAY
Between lessons, Barbara passes Brian as they head in
opposite directions.
EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - DAY
Two POLICE OFFICERS waik Sheba to their waiting car. Richard
stands in the background.
INT. BARBARA’S BEDROOM ~ NIGHT
Barbara lies in bed, in the dark.
BARBARA (V.O.)
My guilt is tempered with relief. She assumes
the boy cracked and told his mother all. Who
am I to disabuse her?

INT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

Barbara spots Brian coming in. As he strides away down the
corridor.

BARBARA
Brian, do stop a moment, please...

BRIAN
I don’t want to hear it.

INT. BARBARA'S FLAT ~— NIGHT

Barbara watching the news on TV. A report on the ‘London
teacher sex scandal’.

TV JOURNALIST
--.and there are further unconfirmed reports
that a member of staff may have known of the
affair...

Barbara watches, agog with fear.
INT. PABBLEM

The spotless

’S OFFICE - DAY

office of a liberal zealot; the pot plants, the

good cause posters, a carved ‘ethnic’ figurine.

BARBARA
I’ve told you, had I known anything I’d have
informed you immediately. My only loyalty is
to the school!

Pabblem at his desk, doesn’t believe a word of it.

He stares at

PABBLEM
Brian thinks you‘ve known for months.

BARBARA
Brian ‘thinks‘?!

PABBLEM
And then there's Sue Hodge-

BARBARA
Will you be running through the entire staff
room?

PABBLEM
If you knew and did nothing then you’ve
enabled a crime.

BARBARA
I didn’t so I haven’t. Your point?

her, has wanted to do this for years.
PABBLEM

I think it would benefit everyone if you
retired. With immediate effect.

Oh so it’s a witch hunt - Salem comes to
Islington!

She strides to the door but Pabblem gets there first and
blocks her exit.

PABBLEM
The stress of the job, radical new ideas in
teaching not to your taste-

BARBARA
I’ve got an idea; your school, your disaster -
why don’t you resign?
PABBLEM
BECAUSE I AM NOT THE CONFIDANTE OF A CRIMINAL!

Now...tell me about this ‘friendship’ with Mrs
Hart...

BARBARA
I think you’ll find that a friendship between
consenting adults is perfectly legal - even
under your regime. My record here is beyond
reproach, the majority of the staff regard me
as their moral guardian.

Pabblem quails at the outrageousness of the woman. Barbara
tries to open the door but he stops it, eyeballs her.

PABBLEM
I’ve just spoken to another of your ‘close’
friends. Jennifer Dodd.

 

Barbara reacts. He gently closes the door, stares at her,
penetrating.

PABBLEM
She was most enlightening.

He has deployed the ultimate weapon. For the first time ever,
he’s got her.

BARBARA
Jennifer became unwell, that’s why she left
the school.

PABBLEM
She says it’s because you were stalking her.
BARBARA
She’s an hysteric.
PABBLEM
Jennifer threatened you with an injunction,
didn’t she?
BARBARA

Nonsense!
He dashes to his desk and brandishes a piece of paper.

PABBLEM
A fax from her solicitors! Jennifer didn’t
want you within five hundred yards of her — by
law! You call that a friendship?! She told me
you sent her fiancee a wreath!

33
Barbara looks away, won’t let him see her distress.
PABBLEM
Now we wouldn’t want all this to come out,
would we? Thirty years of ‘exemplary’ service

ending in shame and humiliation. Hmmm? Your
choice, Barbara.

INT. SCHOOL TOILETS - MOMENTS LATER,

Barbara vomiting.

Above her head, amongst the graffiti: Mad Babs Covett = nasty
old lezza

Someone else has scrawled: i wanna lick her mangy twat!!!

INT. STAFF ROOM - LATER

fea break. Staff buzz around, agog with the ’Covett sacking
rumour’. Barbara comes in. A pause as people see her.

Sue Hodge - big as a barn - stares at her defiantly from
Barbara’s own chair. Elaine Clifford serves her tea while
other teachers fuss around her.

Barbara hurries out the room.

EXT/INT. BARBARA’S STREET/FLAT —- LATE AFTER-NOON
Barbara gets out her car and approaches home. Shattered.

There’s a FIGURE on the other side of the road. He emerges
from behind a car - sees her. They lock eyes. It’s STEVEN. He
looks ravaged with exhaustion and the stress of it all.

He comes up to her, close. Barbara bustles past him and he
follows, impassive, it scares her.

She rushes down the stairs to her door, fumbling for the key.
He follows after. Just as he comes tearing down the stairs
she manages to get in and slam the door. He bangs at the
window in fury.

Inside - Barbara clutches herself in fear and shame. Junk
mail littered at her feet.

She listens...relieved to hear the sound of his footsteps up
her stone stairs.
BARBARA (V.0.)

He knows. Does she know too?

(beat)

More than I can bear.
INT. SITTING ROOM ~ NIGHT
Barbara in her armchair, curtains drawn. Still and silent.

BARBARA (V.0O.)
Is that why she’s not returned my calls?

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Barbara removing her make up. Slow, meticulous, distant. She
stares at herself, consumed with self-loathing.

She opens her mirrored cabinet. Tucked in the corner there’s
a bottle of paracetemol. She focuses on it.

BARBARA (V.0.)
Is this the shape of it? ‘Ex~teacher takes
life in basement flat’.

And then the phone rings...

EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - DAY

PRESS have assembled on the pavement with TV cameras and
PHOTOGRAPHERS - some on step ladders.

TWO POLICE OFFICERS prevent them from storming the front
garden.

The POLICE hold them back as Barbara hurries up the path to
the front door where Richard lets her in.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Richard looks bedraggled, up all night misery. She gestures
outside.

BARBARA
Barbarians!

Richard nods. They stand facing each other. A weird echo of
their first meeting four months ago.

Wp

eae
RICHARD
Sorry about your job.

She's over-emotional and speaks needlessly.

BARBARA
You see, the headmaster thought I knew!

He’s on to her in a flash:

RICHARD
Did you?

BARBARA
No!

They stare at each other.

Where is she?

RICHARD
In her lair.

He gestures outside.

EXT. GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER.

Barbara hurries to the summerhouse. Polly and Sheba are mid-
xow. Barbara hides behind a bush.

POLLY
Your boyfriend is younger than mine!

SHEBA
He’s not my boyfriend!

POLLY
Don’t kid yourself we’ll ever forgive you.

SHEBA
I don’t expect you to. Hate me ~ I deserve it.
But I won’t stop loving you and I won’t stop
being your mother!

POLLY
The fuck is that?! What’s that?! You slept
with a child!

Polly storms off, then spots Barbara.
POLLY
Oh, Jesus wept! The spectre at the feast!

BARBARA
Watch your tongue, young lady.

. POLLY
Frigging freak!

Barbara knocks on the open door. Sheba turns, relieved to see
her. Barbara opens her ams and they hug warmly.

There, there.
Barbara fishes in her bag and gives Sheba a tissue.

BARBARA
Here you are.

Barbara sits Sheba down.

SHEBA
Thanks for coming.
(pause)
I’m so sorry about school. Was he awful to
you?

Barbara nods, bravely. They sit in silence for a while.
SHEBA
Listen...would...you can say no,..I'd
completely understand. Richard... needs some
time alone...actually, he's asked me to leave.
Could I come and stay with you? Just for a few
days?
Barbara manages to affect the illusion of ‘thinking about it’
despite her elation.
You’re welcome for as long as you like.

Sheba hugs her with gratitude.

INT. HOUSE - LATER

Richard paces in the sitting room as Barbara hovers in the
hall.

BARBARA
Ts Ben at school?

}
1

Richard nods.

BARBARA
Does he...know what’s happening?
RICHARD
(furiously)

It’s really none of your business!
Sheba comes down the stairs carrying a suitcase.

Richard gives Barbara a look, ‘go’. Barbara takes the
suitcase and goes out the front door.

Instantly the cameras flash - and then the groans as the
press see it’s not who they want.

Richard faces Sheba, his back to the front door.

RICHARD
I knew who you were when we met. You were
young. I knew it might get tough. But I was
prepared.

He hoids her shoulders:

RICHARD
You’re a good mother. But at times you’ve been
a fucking lousy wife. Why didn’t you come to
me? You could’ve told me how lonely you were.
You never trusted me to help you.
I’m not saying I’m so fucking fabulous but I
was here.

Sheba accepts it. They look at each other. Then he opens the
front door and stands behind it as she goes out.

A HUGE FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT as she faces the CAMERAS.

FADE TO:

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT (A MONTH LATER)

BARBARA (V.O.)
This last month has been the most delicious
time of my life.

Sheba asleep on the sofa bed. A bare leg exposed. Barbara in
an armchair, watching over her.
BARBARA (V.O.)

Of course we've had our ups and downs. The
pressure is intense when two women share their
lives.

Her hand hovers over the leg, wants to stroke her but doesn’t
dare.

BARBARA (V.O.)
But oh, what marvellous intensity it is!

She carefully covers Sheba’s leg with a blanket.

EXT. BARBARA'S FLAT - DAY
A bright Spring day - but the basement curtains are drawn.

A pack of JOURNALISTS, TV CREWS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. They joke
amongst themselves, an atmosphere of crude jollity.

The front door opens a crack. They jump into action. Barbara
emerges with her tartan shopping trolley on wheels.

MALE JOURNALIST
It’s the crone!

Barbara comes up the exterior stairs to ground level. They
cluster around her. Barbara wheels her shopping basket
through their midst, imperious.

A few give chase but the majority know it’s not worth it.

Back at the flat a curtain twitches and the cameras flash.

INT. SITTING ROOM, FLAT.

Sheba closes the curtain. She wears a long, ratty t-shirt,
knickers and socks.

It’s noon. She’s just got up. She starts to fold her sheets
and blankets. A prisoner.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Admittedly, circumstances are not always
ideal...
INT. BATHROOM.

Sheba on the loo, urinating. Utterly desolate.

44
BARBARA (V.0.)
The swinish press, the stringent bail terms,
meetings with lawyers and so on.

The clutter of Sheba’s toiletries and make-up mingled with
Barbara’s.

BARBARA (V.0.)
But all things considered we're coping
admirably. In fact, gold stars abundant!

Sheba steps on a tiny gold star - incongruously bright and
shining - on the grubby floor.

INT. CORRIDOR/BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Sheba comes out the bathroom and wanders down the corridor
into Barbara’s bedroom.

She hitches up her t~shirt in front of the mirror, broodily
posing like an adolescent.

BARBARA (V.0.)
The cuckold permits her to see their children
once a week. Under strict supervision of
course.

Sheba sits at the dressing table. She examines her foot. she
picks the gold star off. Odd...

BARBARA (V-O.)
There are usually tears - such big, salty
tears she cries - and fits of teenage tantrums
too.

Sheba puts on some make up, dark eye liner, red lips. She’s
bored out of her brain.

BARBARA (V.O.)
In time she’ll recognize she’s just not the
mothering kind...

Sheba stops, spots another gold star on the carpet. She picks
it up and flicks it into the bin.

BARBARA (V.0.)
And then Barbara will be there to comfort her;
nurse, beloved friend and wise counsel.

The bin is full of fag butts, evidence of a long night’s
work. Sheba sees another gold star amongst the detritus.
BARBARA (V.0.)
I used to waddle through the world virtually
invisible but now I seem somehow to shine.

Sheba spots a scrap of crumpled paper ripped from a notebook -
two gold stars on it.

BARBARA (V.O.)
At last, I am me.

Sheba takes the scrap of paper from the bin. Sees Barbara’s
handwriting on it. Sheba reads...

CLOSE: the page from Barbara’s journal.

Sheba reading in horror.

INI. SUPERMARKET - SAME TIME

Barbara choosing food, comparing prices, has to be frugal.
She merrily picks out a big, white loaf. Fish fingers,
Sausages, baked beans. Comfort food.

INT. BARBARA’S BEDROOM.

Sheba leaps up, pulls opens a dressing table drawer: Make up.
Another: a hair dryer. Another: Stationery; pens, paper and a
packet of gold stars...

Sheba frantically searches, ransacking the place.

INT. SUPERMARKET - SAME TIME

Barbara queues at the checkout, chatting with her fellow
shoppers. No longer one of the lonely - a woman of purpose.

INT. BARBARA’S BEDROOM

Sheba searches drawers, under the bed, in cupboards, turns
out the laundry basket - until finally...in the bottom of a
little drawer beneath the mirror she finds the journal.

She flicks through: Barbara’s black ink handwriting - mainly
neat but now and then with violent crossings out and furious,
mad, margin scrawlings.

The gold stars charting the various ups and downs...

Ibo
A photo: Barbara and JENNIFER DODD in Paris, smiling at the
camera. Jennifer is around the same age as Sheba, a similar
look.

Beneath the photo Barbara has written, ‘Paris 2003 - before
the worm turned’.

On another page Sheba finds a Pizza Express receipt marked
‘Ladies who lunch! !!’.

And there are numerous clippings from recent newspaper
reports on the scandal.

On an earlier page a strand of hair is taped in. Barbara‘s
handwriting: ‘A strand of her hair’.

Sheba reads on with mounting horror...

EXT. STREET/BARBARA’S FLAT - LATER

Barbara wheeling her full shopping trolley down the street.
The Press still camped outside her flat.

JOURNALIST
The crone returneth!

Barbara sails through the hordes.

INT. BARBARA‘S FLAT - CONTINUOUS
She lets herself in. Instantly knows something’s wrong.

BARBARA
Sheba. ..?

The flat has been completely trashed. Furniture and cushions
ripped with a carving knife, crockery smashed, books and
ornaments torn from shelves.

Sheba is sat on the edge of an armchair. Fully dressed now,
wearing her coat, her suitcase by her side.

She's savage with rage - clutching the journal. Her make up
disturbing, eyes black with mascara, lips a violent red.

SHEBA
What you say, about me, about Richard. You’re
not fit to shine his shoes. And Ben and
Polly-..that I'd be better off without them?

Sheba rises. Slowly approaches. Barbara holds her ground.
SHEBA
Why did you do it? Because I didn’t help you
collect your CAT!

Sheba slaps her hard across the face. Barbara flinches but
doesn’t budge, accepting her punishment.

Sheba slaps her again. Barbara stands firm, taking it,
despite the pain. .

BARBARA
Let it all out...

SHEBA
You’ve cost me my family!

BARBARA
Oh, take some responsibility! They’d have
found out in the end! I’ve given you exactly
what you wanted - without me you’d still be
stuck in that marriage!

SHEBA
What?!!

BARBARA
You can’t accept it yet but-

SHEBA
You think I wanted to be HERE WITH YOU!!

BARBARA
Maybe you didn’t want it to - to happen quite
like this but we both know you need me, I’m
your friend!

SHEBA
You’ve put me in prison, I could get Two
YEARS!

BARBARA

They'll fly by! 1’11 visit every week. We have
so much life to live - together!

SHEBA
You — WHAT? You think this is a LOVE affair?!
A relationship?!

She brandishes the journal as evidence.

SHEBA
Sticky gold stars and - and - a strand of my
HAIR??! A receipt from PIZZA EXPRESS!?

SHEBA (cont'd)
(gestures to the room)
It’s a basement flat off the ARCHWAY ROAD and
you think you’re Virginia frigging Woolf! And
where did you get my hair? Did you pluck it
from the bath with some special fucking
tweezers?!

BARBARA
Don’t you know it’s rude to read a person’s
diary, it’s PRIVATE!

Barbara lunges for the diary but Sheba pulls it away.

SHEBA
It’s all BULLSHIT! We‘re not COMPANIONS, we’re
not FRIENDS - you don’t even like me!

BARBARA
(urgently)
No! I - I have only tender feelings for you -
only love!

SHEBA
YOU’RE BARKING FUCKING MAD! You don’t know how
to LOVE! You‘ve never - your whole life - me -
Jennifer fucking Dodd - you’re just WASTE and
disappointment, you DYKE, you BITTER OLD
VIRGIN! Endlessly justifying yourself with how
lonely you are - you’re lonely for a REASON!
They hated you at school ~ all of them ~ for
THIRTY YEARS! I was the idiot who bothered but
only cos no one told me you’re a VAMPIRE! So
what is it, Ba - you — you wanna roll around
on the floor like LOVERS?! You wanna fuck me,
Barbara?

BARBARA
Please don’t diminish our-

SHEBA
Our WHAT?!! OUR WHAT??1!

Sheba starts ripping out the sacred pages from the diary.
Barbara fights for the book desperate to rescue it.

BARBARA
Give it back!

They tug and pull - struggling - locked together.

BARBARA
I know you - born selfish and vain - think
you’ve a divine right - you BIG BABY! You
don’t belong in the world, YOU BELONG HERE!
Sheba lets out a roar of fury right in Barbara’s face.

SHEBA
AABABAAGGGGGHHHHH! !!

Barbara releases her grip and Sheba tears the book from her.
She runs out the front door - wild.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Sheba charges up the basement steps only for the amazed Press
to surround her.

SHEBA
HERE I AM! HERE I AM!

Sheba screams and howls giving them exactly what they want.
Barbara watches it all from her window.

JOURNALIST 1
Oh my god, she’s gone berserk!

JOURNALIST 2
It’s Christmas!

Sheba tries to break through them but is trapped in their
tight circle. She’s scared now...

SHEBA
Please...let me go now...that’s
enough. ..please...

They continue to flash their cameras and pummel her with
questions.

Barbara rushes out the door and barges through them, elbowing
her way with all the force in her body - a strangely heroic
little figure amongst the seething men.

BARBARA
Let me through you OAF - GET OUT MY WAY ~ give
us some room here!

She manages to hustle an almost grateful Sheba back into the
flat. She slams the door.
INT. HALLWAY — CONTINUOUS

Barbara and Sheba getting their breath. Two fighters all
punched out.
INT. BARBARA’S FLAT —- LATER THAT NIGHT

Barbara with a big, black bin liner tidying the mess. She
scoops some broken glass into the bag.

Sheba at the kitchen table, still holding the journal.

SHEBA
We never invited you to the fucking Dordogne.

BARBARA
I’m sorry but you specifically said if I
happened to be in France then I must drop-—

SHEBA
We didn’t mean it!

Barbara forces herself to stay calm.
BARBARA
Well...fine.
(an afterthought)
I won’t come then.
Sheba shakes her head, ‘bonkers’. She puts on her coat.
SHEBA
I asked you to lunch because I liked you. I
would’ve been your friend.
BARBARA
(softly)
I need more than a friend.

They look at each other. No anger, just stalemate. Sheba
hands Barbara the journal and leaves.

Barbara in her trashed flat. Desolate.

She places the journal on an empty shelf.

INT/EXT. TAXI/LONDON STREETS - LATER

Sheba in a cab, heading home.

EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Sheba stood outside her house. Warm lights on inside.

She climbs the stairs and nervously knocks on the door.
0"

After a while Richard opens it. They look at each other.

And then he motions her in and closes the door.

EXT. HIGH STREET - DAY (A WEEK LATER)

Bustle of people. Barbara amongst then.

INT. STATIONERS.

Barbara selects a new journal from the shelf.

She goes to the checkout - ignoring the section where they
sell the gold stars.

EXT. BARBARA'S STREET.

Barbara walking, her new journal in its plastic bag. She
heads down the concrete stairs to her front door.

INT. BARBARA’S FLAT, SITTING ROOM - DAY

Barbara at. her kitchen table. The flat looks bare and bleak,
stripped of all life.

She takes out her new diary and smooths down the spine on the
first page.

She uncaps her pen, poised to write. ‘
She thinks. Nothing to say.

She sits in silence. ‘

EXT, PARLIAMENT HILL - DAY (3 MONTHS LATER)

CLOSE: newspaper headline: ‘Sex Teacher sentenced to 16
months’ -

Under it a press photo of Sheba being shepherded into court
by Richard.

A WOMAN sat on ‘the’ bench reading the newspaper. She sips a
takeaway cappuccino, reads on, engrossed in the story.

BARBARA (0-S.)
I knew her...
[So

The woman turns, Barbara is standing behind her.

WOMAN

Really?
BARBARA

We taught at the same school.
WOMAN

God. What was she like?
BARBARA

(thinks)

---A bit chilly. And perhaps a
touch...furtive. A sort of absent person. But
I didn’t know her well.

(beat)
May I?

She sits next to the woman.

WOMAN
Do you still teach?

BARBARA
No, no, retired. Thank goodness.

The woman sips her coffee producing a little dab of froth on
her nose. Barbara points to it, amused. The woman shrugs,
charmingly, and searches for a tissue. In an instant Barbara
produces one and hands it to her.

WOMAN
Thanks.

They sit back admiring the view.

BARBARA
I do love it here.

WOMAN
Mmm.
BARBARA
It’s spectacular at dusk.
Barbara turns to her lovely new prey.

BARBARA
I’m Barbara.

WOMAN
Annabel.
They shake hands.

As they continue to talk the camera moves behind them to take
in the view, as at the beginning.

Two women on a bench. The city in the distance.

FADE TO BLACK.
