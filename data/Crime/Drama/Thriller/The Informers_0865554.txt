GREEN CORN STALKS STROBE PAST

We hear a happy and informative man’s voice. We will come to
know this voice as MARK WHITACRE’S.

WHITACRE (V.O.)
You know the orange juice you have
every morning? You know what’s in
that?

REST ON AN EAR OF CORN IN THE CENTER OF FRAME
Golden kernels peaking out from behind the husks.
WHITACRE (V.0.)
Corn.

EXTERIOR CORN FIELD - DAY

We are in the middle of an endless cornfield in SOUTHERN
ILLINOIS.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
And you know what’s in the maple
syrup you put on your pancakes?
You know what makes it taste so
good?

Huge industrial machines work the ruler straight rows of
crops.

WHITACRE (V.O.)
Corn.

A red PORSCHE 911 speeds past the corn, down US HIGHWAY 36.
WHITACRE (V.0.)

And when you’re good and help with

the trash, know what makes the big,

green bags biodegradable?
INTERIOR PORSCHE 911 - CONTINUOUS
WHITACRE, 33, drives his young son ALEXANDER, 6, to school.
God doesn’t make creatures any happier than Whitacre.
Alexander sips his half-pint carton of ORANGE JUICE.

WHITACRE
Do you?

Alexander hazards a guess.

ALEXANDER
Uh-huh. Corn.
AS PRODUCED 2.

WHITACRE
Corn starch. But, Daddy’s company
didn’t come up with that one--
DuPont did.

Whitacre thoughts continue in his head.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

Porsche or Porsh-a. I’ve heard it
both ways. Three years in Germany,
I should know that. What’s the
German word for corn? The word in
German I really like is
“kugelschreiber.” That’s “pen.” All
those syllables just for “pen.”

EXTERIOR ADM HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

The Porsche pulls up to the security gate at ARCHER DANIELS
MIDLAND headquarters in Decatur. A sprawling industrial
facility that makes most of what America eats on any given
day. And the rest of the world.

Grain elevators, cooling towers, processing plants, loading
docks and a six story concrete bunker of an office building.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

Archer Daniels Midland. Most
people have never heard of us. But
chances are, they’ve never had a
meal we're not part of. Just read
the side of the package.

INTERIOR ADM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Whitacre walks through the office.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

That’s us. Now ADM is taking the
dextrose from the corn and turning
it into an amino acid called
lysine. It’s all very scientific.
But if you’re a stockholder, all
that matters is that corn goes in
one end and profit comes out the
other.

He waves to everyone he passes. Smile flashing like a casino
sign.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

We've got the largest lysine plant
in the world here. That’s where I
come in.
AS PRODUCED 3.

Whitacre spots his pal KIRK SCHMIDT from accounting.

WHITACRE
Kirk, when are we gonna get out
there and hit some balls?

They shake hands and Whitacre moves on, his inner monologue
continuing over Kirk’s response.

WHITACRE (V.O.)

What do they pay Kirk...What does a
guy like that get? I bet he gets a
hundred grand. He’s just going to
sit behind that desk and ride it
into the future.

Whitacre waves to a coworker as he enters his glass walled
office.

WHITACRE
Gutten morgen.

SUPER: DECATUR OCTOBER 1992

INTERIOR WHITACRE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Whitacre’s secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, 35, enters. Her earrings
are little golden EARS OF CORN.

LIZ TAYLOR
Morning Mark. They have lysine
results.

She hands him a folder. He opens it and scans the data. A
column of red numbers and negative signs. Whitacre remains
positive.

WHITACRE
Great.

INTERIOR LYSINE PLANT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Whitacre walks among the giant fermenters -- he’s joined by
DISCOURAGED FOREMAN. They check various gauges and dials.

DISCOURAGED FOREMAN
We adjusted the dextrose again, but
the virus keeps showing up. Thought
we had it surrounded this time.
We're starting a new set of

cultures.

WHITACRE
We'll get it. We just have to stay
after it.

The things eat sugar and that’s
what we’re giving them -- a warm

INTERIOR ADM BOARDROOM - LATER

Whitacre sits with MICK ANDREAS, Vice Chairman, 45,

4.

and TERRY

WILSON, 55, President. An overhead projector displays the

desultory performance of Whitacre’s division.

ANDREAS
The fucking thing is supposed to
produce 113 thousand tons annually.
We're not gonna get anywhere near
that. We got 150 million dollars in
costs over there guys.

WILSON
Did the Japanese have these kind of
problems with lysine?

ANDREAS
(to Whitacre)
I don’t give a shit about the
Japanese. You just gotta get the
Goddamn lysine bugs to eat the
dextrose and shit us out some
money.

WHITACRE
We’re still having problems with
this virus.

ANDREAS
I don’t want to hear about the
virus anymore. Terry, how much are
we losing a month?

WILSON
We are down like seven million per.

ANDREAS
That’s not gonna fly much longer.
You want to go in there next month
and tell my father we’re sucking
hind tit on this? I sure don’t.
We're number 44 on the Fortune 500
list, Mark. I don’t want this
turning us into number 45.

He gives Whitacre a we’re-done-fucking-around glare.

ANDREAS
Fix it.

EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION - EVENING

Warm light radiates from a large home with tall white
columns.

A PORTRAIT OF THE WHITACRE FAMILY
On the mantle. Whitacre, his wife and their three children.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
You feed a chicken a diet of corn
and it gets sick -- like what
happened to the first settlers.
Pellagra disease. Niacin
deficiency -- gave them all sorts
of problems -- dermatitis, ataxia
and even dementia.

INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION DINING ROOM - EVENING

Whitacre stares at an EAR OF CORN on his dinner plate. His
wife GINGER, 33, slices up Alexander’s dinner -- a CHICKEN
BREAST. Whitacre is lost in thought. His focus shifting
from corn to chicken and back again.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
But you feed a chicken corn and
lysine and it goes from egg to
supermarket fryer to in six months
instead of eight.

Ginger stares at Mark. He’s miles away in his head.

GINGER
Mark? Where are you?

WHITACRE
You look great.

GINGER
They got the first wall of the
stables up today. You see that?

WHITACRE
They’re doing a new thing in
hydroponics. They’re now feeding
lysine to jumbo shrimp. Can you
imagine that? You’re a jumbo shrimp
and one day some corn goes floating
by. What do you think about that?
Weird, right?

Alexander smiles.
AS PRODUCED 6.

WHITACRE
You know, there’s an opening down
in the plant in Mexico -- they

might need me to go down and set
some stuff up. What do you think
about Mexico?

ALEXANDER
I thought we were getting horses.

EXTERIOR ADM —- MORNING
Grey smoke pumps into a grey sky.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
Toro. That’s what Spanish
bullfighters say. But it’s also
what the Japanese call the high-end
tuna sushi. Toro. Raw fish.

INTERIOR ADM - CONTINUOUS
The trading floor is bustling.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
Who went first on that? The guy
without the grill.

Soy and corn futures from around the world are displayed on a
tote board. Numbers tick up and down.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
I’ve been to Tokyo. They sell
little girl underwear in the
vending machines right on the main
drag -- the Ginza, or whatever.

INTERIOR WHITACRE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Whitacre frowns as he pours over the lysine results -- more
red.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
Guys in suits buying used girl
panties. How is that okay? That’s
not okay.

His secretary buzzes him on the intercom. Whitacre picks up.

WHITACRE
Yeah?
AS PRODUCED 7.

LIZ TAYLOR
(on the intercom)
There’s a Mr. Nakawara calling from
the Ajinomoto Corporation. He says
you know him and he needs to speak
with you.

WHITACRE
Put him through.

Whitacre picks up the phone. Gets to work.

INTERIOR MICK ANDREAS' OFFICE ADM - LATER

Mick Andreas sits at his desk. Whitacre paces -- very wound
up.

WHITACRE
It’s the Japanese. There’s this
guy, Nakawara. He works at
Ajinomoto. He was here a couple
weeks ago. You met him. Now I’ve
been talking to him on the phone--
sometimes at work, sometimes at
home because of the time
difference. Mick, this guy knew
everything. Everything. He says
to me, “You know the total
nightmare you had during May, June,
July?” Before I can ask him what
he means he goes, “Those months
when ADM was losing about seven
million dollars a month in the
lysine business?”

Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock -- no one outside the
company should know that. Andreas is stone faced.

WHITACRE
Mick, I couldn’t believe it. He
goes on to tell me that one of our
highest paid employees is actually
an employee of Ajinomoto who is
sabotaging the plant. They’re
injecting a virus into the dextrose
and contaminating the whole deal.
That’s the problem. I'’11 tell you
Mick, it’s like Rising Sun, that
Crichton novel, it’s just like it.
So I go, why are you talking to me
about this and you know what he
says...

ANDREAS
Yeah, I know what he says. How
much does he want?
AS PRODUCED 8.

WHITACRE
Ten million dollars. Ten million.
But that gives you the identity of
the saboteur, the secret identity,
and a new lysine bug that is immune
to the virus. We have the plant up
and running in three days.

Andreas pauses, takes it all in, and then...

ANDREAS
How well do you know this guy?

WHITACRE
I met him when he was here. We've
spoken on the phone a half dozen
times.

ANDREAS
So, not very well.

WHITACRE
Very well? No, I wouldn’t say that.

Andreas ponders the situation.

ANDREAS

Okay, if you hear from him again --
talk him down on the price. I want
you to find out the least amount of
money he’d settle for. If we can
get a bug that's resistant to the
virus, this might be worth it. But,
I want you to keep this secret, if
there is a mole, we don’t want him
to know we’re onto him.

WHITACRE
Absolutely.

EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION - EVENING

Whitacre stands with a cocktail in the fading light, looking
at the foundation for the NEW HORSE STABLES being built
across the road from the main house. On all sides of the
house -- more cornfields. Not another home in sight.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

This’d be a great place for some
outlet stores...People would come
from all over southern Illinois and
probably Missouri, too. Famous
name brand labels and appliances at
savings of up to fifty per cent
every day. Maybe a food court with
a Mexican place.
AS PRODUCED 9.

Whitacre looks at a swarm of insects around the lone street
light.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
The birds eat the bugs, the cars
eat the birds, the rust eats the
cars and the new construction eats
the rust...

Ginger interrupts Whitacre’s grand plan from across the
street...

GINGER
Corky, Alexander says there’s a bat
in his room.

INTERIOR ADM - MICK ANDREAS' OFFICE

Whitacre shakes his head in disbelief. He paces nervously.
Stunned by the news.

WHITACRE
The FBI! God, no.

Andreas and MARK CHEVIRON, 38, tell Whitacre of his upcoming
FBI interview. Cheviron is a barrel chested, linebacker of a
man. A former Decatur cop, who is now ADM’s version of a
bouncer.

WHITACRE
I thought you wanted me to talk him
down on the price. That’s what you
told me to do and I was doing it.

ANDREAS
We're not gonna sit back and let
the Japanese fuck us sideways on
this.

WHITACRE
(off Cheviron)
I just don’t understand -- we
weren't going to mention it and now
he’s in on it?

ANDREAS
Of course he’s in on it. If it’s a
mole then it’s a security issue.

CHEVIRON
I’‘ll be sitting in with the FBI.

WHITACRE
I already told you everything there
is to tell. What is the point?
AS PRODUCED 10.

Cheviron is annoyed by Whitacre’s histrionics.

CHEVIRON
We don’t like the idea of talking
to the FBI any more than you do.
They’re just going to tape the
guy's calls -- and ask you a few
questions. No big deal.

Whitacre shakes his head, even more upset.

WHITACRE
Questions? Jesus.

Whitacre storms out.

ANDREAS
Mark.

INTERIOR WHITACRE KITCHEN - DAY

Ginger talks on the phone, surrounded by full grocery bags.
She remains calm and firm -- never a hair out of place.

GINGER
The FBI? Why do you have to talk to
the FBI? It’s their plant. Just let
them talk to the FBI.

INTERIOR WHITACRE’S OFFICE - INTERCUT
Whitacre is on the phone -- pacing like a caged animal.

WHITACRE
I’m really uncomfortable with this.
There are some things going on
here.

INTERIOR KITCHEN/WHITACRE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Ginger looks uneasy. This isn’t like him to be so upset.

GINGER
What does that mean, “things?”

WHITACRE (0.S.)
It just means we have to be
careful.

GINGER
Whatever you do, Corky, no matter
what’s going on, just be honest
with them and tell the truth.
Okay?
AS PRODUCED 11.

INTERIOR ADM CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING

FBI SPECIAL AGENT BRIAN SHEPARD, 43, sits with Cheviron and a
very anxious Mark Whitacre. Shepard wears a rumpled dark
suit and tie from the days when Jay Edgar Hoover set the
dress code.

Whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat. Cheviron on the other
hand is an old hand at this. He watches Whitacre closely --
all poker faced.

WHITACRE
He told me he wanted his payments
wired into a numbered account in
Switzerland and then also in the
Caribbean.

Shepard writes down everything.

SHEPARD
And when did you last have contact
with him?

WHITACRE

Two days ago. But I think he's
getting suspicious. I've been
dragging this thing along. I think
if we don’t make a move. I mean,
he could already have backed down
here.

SHEPARD
And these calls, they’ve been
coming in on your home line?

Whitacre looks at Cheviron -- there’s clearly a right and a
wrong answer here.
WHITACRE
I have an ADM line at my house -- a
business line -- they’ve been

coming in on the business line.
WHITACRE’S POV

Drifting from Shepard’s face to his ADAM’S APPLE. The knot
of his FBI TIE bobs up and down as he speaks.
SHEPARD

(under )
Well, we need to start by
putting a recording device on
your phone. We should make
arrangements to do that as
soon as possible. We also
need a list of everyone in
the bioproducts division to
see if we can see who's
operating on the inside.
We’ll want phone records,
employment histories and any
other background checks that
ADM may have...

CHEVIRON

I can help with that.

WHITACRE
So, that’s it then.

Shepard hands Whitacre his card.

SHEPARD

WHITACRE (V.0.)

(over)
There’s a sale at Bacarach’s.
They have those Oscar de la
Renta ties that nobody buys--
what are they two for one for
another week? Diagonal bands
of color hanging around your
neck. They never put the
nice Brioni ties on sale. I
should just get all my ties
in Paris, wear them once or
twice, and shove them in a
duty free bag. Nobody gets
stopped at customs for ties.

I can go?

They shake hands.

I’d like to come out tomorrow and

get on that phone.

WHITACRE
No problem.

Thank you for your

INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

Whitacre comes in from a long day at work.

Ginger walks in

from the kitchen. She gives him a welcome home hug -- but he
doesn’t let go -- holding on like a man caught in the
current.

GINGER

You told them the truth, Mark.
That’s all you can do.

WHITACRE
I never even had the chance.
She slips from his arms -- disappointed.
WHITACRE

They were watching me the whole
time. Cheviron was in the room.

Ginger eyes him disdainfully.

Off her disappointment, he
heads upstairs to bed.

INTERIOR ADM HEADQUARTERS - MORNING
Whitacre walks through the office.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

Mick Andreas gets born with the
Vice President of the United States
as his Godfather. He goes to
Richard Nixon’s house for
Thanksgiving. It’s not like his
parents died in a car accident when
he was three and he ended up in an
orphanage.

His secretary walks over with two message slips.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

Mick’s dad wrote a check to the
Nixon campaign and it wound up in
the bank account of the Watergate
burglars. Did he admit it? I don’t
think so. Besides, ADM probably
owns the FBI. They probably wanted
me to buy Dwayne’s old house when I
took this job because they’ve got
it wired like in a Chrichton
novel.

INTERIOR WHITACRE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Liz hands him the messages.
LIZ TAYLOR
Marty Allison called and Sid Hulse

INTERIOR COUNTRY CLUB OF DECATUR - NIGHT
Whitacre and a very dolled-up Ginger dine with SID HULSE, 35,

Whitacre shoots him a look.

WHITACRE
Not funny, Sid.

SID HULSE
You're telling me.

Sid laughs. Ginger doesn't get the joke.

WHITACRE
So, Sid, you're off tomorrow? Where
to?

ANGLE ON WHITACRE'S HAND UNDER THE TABLE

He covertly slides a business card into Ginger's hand.
GINGER’S POV OF THE CARD

On the back is scribbled, "The FBI is coming at 10 PM."

SID HULSE
West coast swing -- I gotta get out
there and kick some Japanese butt.
So, I’m not gonna see you for a
couple weeks. Maybe longer if I
get lost in the Ginza.

She’s still digesting what’s on the card -- trying to act
natural.

GINGER
Have a great trip, Sid.

INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION - LATER

Alexander is sleeping. He stirs when he hears Ginger and
Whitacre whispering in the living room.

GINGER (0.S.)

will.

Her face is a mask of determination.

Behind them the drapes are illuminated by headlights in the
drive. Whitacre is desperate.

WHITACRE
Ican’t. Not now.

The doorbell rings. Whitacre opens the door to reveal Agent
Shepard.

WHITACRE
Hello. Please come in. Agent
Shepard, my wife, Ginger.

SHEPARD
Ma‘am. I know it’s late. I'll be
out of your hair in a minute.

WHITACRE
Great.

Maybe a cup of coffee for Agent

Okay.

She watches them over her shoulder as she heads to the

There should be a TV show about a
guy who calls home one day and he’s
there -- he answers. He’s talking

He’s somehow divided into two and
the second one of him drives away.
And the rest of the show is about
him trying to find the guy.

EXTERIOR WHITACRE PORCH - NIGHT
Whitacre walks Shepard to the door where Ginger is waiting.
SHEPARD
I'll give you a call tomorrow. We
can test it out.
WHITACRE
Great. Great, thank you for coming

SHEPARD
Good night. Good night, Mrs.

Shepard walks toward his car. Ginger and Mark linger.
GINGER
(to her husband)
Are you going to say something or
am I?
Ginger pushes past him.

GINGER

Shepard stops. Whitacre has no choice.

You got a minute?

Whitacre walks past his wife toward the car. Ginger squeezes
his hand as he passes her on the steps.

WHITACRE

They might have it bugged. We're

Shepard is confused.

SHEPARD
Bugged? What? Who? Us?

Whitacre is ready to spill. He looks at the house -- knows
Ginger is watching.

WHITACRE
There are things I know. If I
decide to tell you, could I be
prosecuted?

SHEPARD
I cannot provide you with immunity,
but any information you tell me
about your involvement in criminal
activity would be discussed in a
favorable light with the US
attorney’s office.

Beat.
WHITACRE
Okay. Everything I told you
yesterday about Nakawara was true --
except one thing. He never called
me on my business line.
Shepard looks at Whitacre -- he’s confused.

SHEPARD
Why did you tell me that he did?

WHITACRE
Before I spoke with you yesterday I
was coached by the guys at ADM to
tell you that he called me on my
business line and not my home line.

SHEPARD
Why?

It’s too late to turn back.
AS PRODUCED 18.

WHITACRE
What I'm about to tell you involves
something very large. This
Nakawara extortion thing is nothing
compared to it, nothing at all.
This involves price fixing in the
lysine business...

Shepard gets out his notebook. Fires up his pen.

WHITACRE
I've been in several meetings with
our Japanese and Korean competitors
in the past few months where the
sole purpose was to fix the prices.
ADM made me go to these meetings.

Shepard writes furiously, struggling to see in the dark.
Most of it goes over his head.

WHITACRE
That’s why they wanted me to lie.
Because the Nakawara calls came in
on my home line. But, so do the
calls from the people we’re fixing
prices with. They didn't want you
to hear those conversations so they
instructed me to tell you that the
Nakawara calls came in on my ADM
line. But, see I realized once you
guys started digging around in the
records you’d see that I have all
these calls to Japan. And that’s
what scared me. Nobody's got more
calls than me. If you ever figured
out about the price fixing, I’d be
the fall guy.

Shepard considers the explanation.
SHEPARD
Who told you to participate in
these price fixing talks?
Whitacre takes a deep breath -- lets the cat out of the bag.
WHITACRE
I'm operating under the direction
of Mick and Dwayne Andreas.
EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Whitacre watches from the front door as Shepard turns on his
headlights.
AS PRODUCED 19.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
He seems like a real good guy. I
hope he doesn’t mind me calling him
“Brian” instead of “Agent Shepard.”
I might even try “Bri” out. This

Talking to a guy like me instead of
a bank robber or a drug dealer.

Whitacre waves as Shepard drives away.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
I could see us fishing or whatever.
What a good listener -- you don’t
Meet one of those every day.

INTERIOR ADM - THE NEXT MORNING

Whitacre tries to look natural as he walks to his office, his
first day as a whistle blower. No sooner does he take his
seat than Cheviron appears.

CHEVIRON
Morning. What happened last night?

WHITACRE
What do you mean? Nothing. They put
a recorder on the phone.

CHEVIRON
That’s it?

WHITACRE
Well, yeah. He said when Nakawara
calls, I just flip a switch and
record the conversation.
Whitacre gets buzzed by his secretary. He answers.

morning yogurt.

SHEPARD
....a pound of bacon, a peanut

INTERIOR ADM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Whitacre is headed down the hall with a full head of steam.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

You think the automobile companies

WHITACRE
You told me they were only going to
tap one line! One line!

CHEVIRON
They are only monitoring one line.

WHITACRE
That is not true. That is
absolutely not true. I just got
off the phone with my wife and some
woman named Regina from the phone
company called her saying that both
our lines are tapped. My home
phone!

Cheviron is sick of Whitacre’s antics. He doesn’t believe a
word of it. He gets in his face.

CHEVIRON
Come on, Mark, the phone company
doesn’t call people and say,
“Hello. We just wanted to let you
know that the FBI is tapping your
phone lines.”

WHITACRE
Then why would Regina say that?
CHEVIRON
She didn’t say it, you’re saying
it.

WOOL TURTLENECK.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
I don’t like wool on skin. Not even
that merino wool they have at
Marshall Field in Chicago. Ginger
likes it, cuz it’s form fitting,
but she likes avocados and who
wants that texture in their mouth?
Who would make up someone named
Regina? It’s the capital of
Saskatchewan.

INTERIOR FBI DECATUR - DAY

On the third floor of some mid-70's default architecture in
the heart of downtown Decatur, Brian Shepard sits in an
office big enough for himself, a small evidence safe, a
picture of his family and the flag. Out the window the
stacks of ADM send up great white plumes. Shepard is boning
up on anti-trust law when the phone rings.

Beat.

SHEPARD
FBI. Shepard.

CHEVIRON (0.S.)
Hello. Brian, it’s Mark Cheviron at
ADM.

SHEPARD
Yeah, Mark.

CHEVIRON (0.S.)
I was talking to you guys a couple
of days ago about which of the
lines at Mark Whitacre’s house you
were would be monitoring and we had
agreed it would only be the
business line. So, that’s all you
did right?

SHEPARD
I really can’t answer that.

CHEVIRON
Okay. Thank you.

INTERIOR ADM WHITACRE'S OFFICE - LATER

Whitacre stares out through the glass walls drinking a COKE.
Mick Andreas and Cheviron march into Whitacre’s office on a

mission.
AS PRODUCED 23.

ANDREAS
We've decided that we’re not going
to be cooperating with any further
FBI requests.

Whitacre is outraged. He turns on Cheviron.
WHITACRE
I knew it! I knew it! I told you,
but you wouldn’t listen. You said
just the office line, Mark.

Cheviron has to eat shit here in front of Andreas.

CHEVIRON
Evidently, they were lying to us,
too.

WHITACRE

Evidently, you can’t keep track of
what the FBI is doing.

The phone buzzes.

LIZ TAYLOR
(on intercom)
The call you were expecting, Mark.

Whitacre pauses, then...

WHITACRE
(on intercom)
Well, put him through.
(to the others)
It’s a Swedish deal I’m working on.

Whitacre picks up the phone. It’s not Sweden.

WHITACRE
Mark Whitacre.

SHEPARD (0.S.)
Hey, Mark, it's Brian Shepard.

Andreas and Cheviron continue.

CHEVIRON
I told Shepard we’re done working
with them as of now.

WHITACRE
(over the phone)
Hi. So, it’s good to hear from you.

Whitacre shifts uncomfortably and tries to cover in front of
Mick and Cheviron -- he puts on a phony cheerful voice.

SHEPARD (0.S.)
I'd like to bring my Supervisor by

WHITACRE
Well, great. So, uh, Mr. Andreas is

I’ll talk to you later.

Whitacre hangs up and looks to Mick.

WHITACRE
Now what do I do if this Shepard
guy calls?

ANDREAS
You let me know and I'll tell my
dad. But, you’re done talking to
them.

WHITACRE
Absolutely.

EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LAWN - DAY
Ginger walk across the lawn with Alexander and BILLY.

GINGER
Okay. I’m going to go over the
rules. No running, no pushing, no
horseplay by the pool. When you've
fished all the leaves out, go into
the garage and get the cover for
the pool. And I’m going to go get
your dad when he’s done. He’s
gonna come and do an inspection.

ALEXANDER
You already told us this.

GINGER
Well, I’m going over it again.

Whitacre walks through his six car garage. He passes a Range

Car.

INTERIOR WHITACRE’S BARN - MOMENTS LATER

A large open room looking more like a theme restaurant than

anything that might have once involved agriculture.
pong and foosball tables and a console TV.
AS PRODUCED 25.

Across a pool table, Whitacre talks with FBI agents Shepard
and Paisley.

WHITACRE
Now, what is the scoop with all my
phones being tapped?

PAISLEY
The only listening device was the
recorder, Mark.

SHEPARD
We had a trap and trace device on
your home line -- but we can’t

listen in with that.

PAISLEY
However, the phone company calling
your wife and telling them about
our intel gathering, well, my face
is red on that one. Shouldn't
happen.

SHEPARD
Did you bring the expense reports
we talked about?

Whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork.

WHITACRE

Yeah. This is Mexico City, Paris,
Hong Kong, Tokyo. There was a Corn
Refiners Association meeting in
Florida last week-- Mick and Terry
went to that one. They did the
regular meeting during the day, and
then at night they’d get together
with our competitors and work out
how to fix the prices. Now you
just watch-- in about six months,
the price of a liter of soda pop is
going to be about five cents more.

SHEPARD
When's the next meeting?

WHITACRE
Uh, January. Somewhere in Asia.

Paisley takes it all in. He sizes up Whitacre.

AGENT PAISLEY
Mark, I gotta ask you, why are you
doing this? We know you lied to us
about the phone line and you’re
afraid of that.

(MORE )
AS PRODUCED 26.

AGENT PAISLEY (cont'd)
But, now you’re telling us all this
other stuff out of the blue. I
gotta ask you why.

Whitacre weighs the question.

WHITACRE
Well, cuz things are going on I
don’t approve of. I'm a biochemist.
I’m a technical guy. They pulled me
into the business side and suddenly
I find out all these things are
going on that are illegal. You
know, if I want to grow with ADM I
got to learn the business side.
And suddenly they’re making me lie
to people. I lie to you.

He gestures toward Shepard.

WHITACRE
I mean, I feel real bad about that.

SHEPARD
You look at yourself as wearing a
white hat and they're wearing black
hats.

WHITACRE
Yeah. Absolutely. Something like
that. You know, when I was a kid my
folks died in an automobile
accident. I was maybe six years
old and a wealthy man from Ohio
adopted me. The guy owned
amusement parks and he did very
well for himself. I got a big break
there, a real big break. I went to
a good school and all. Now I
adopted two kids of my own. I’m
trying to do the right thing here.

PAISLEY
Well, Mark, do you think you’d be
willing to go a few steps further
in helping us?

WHITACRE
What does that mean?

Whitacre considers the request -- it’s a chance to be a hero,
but why should he clean up the free market?

SHEPARD
Would you be willing to wear a
wire? We don’t have any other
sources at this time. We need your
help.
AS PRODUCED 27.

PAISLEY
We'll be there with you all the
way, but it won’t be easy.

He looks around at the good life Whitacre has amassed -- the
family, the pool, the house, the cars. A lot to put on the
line.

SHEPARD
I‘’1l use my beeper to signal you
when it’s time to set up a meeting.
When you hear this...

Shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button -- “BEEEEP.”

SHEPARD
You call me.

Whitacre takes the wire. You’re only a White Knight if
you'll carry a sword.

INTERIOR FBI, DECATUR - DAY

Shepard sits in the small office with another agent assigned
to the case -- BOB HERNDON, 33. If Shepard looks like he
stepped out of Dragnet, then Herndon looks like he stepped
out of GQ. He’s younger, more polished, and hasn’t spent his
entire career in Decatur.

SHEPARD

He's watched closely at work and
there's reason to believe that ADM
has bugged his home. He’s under a
great deal of pressure. You gotta
feel for the guy. He tells us the
truth one day and wakes up the next
with two lives instead of one.

HERNDON
Well, the good news is he decided
to wake up and tell the truth.

INTERIOR BEST WESTERN HOTEL - EVENING
Whitacre stands in the lobby watching GUESTS use the indoor
pool.
WHITACRE’S POV OF THE POOL
WHITACRE (V.0.)
There are these butterflies in

Central America.
(MORE )
AS PRODUCED 28.

WHITACRE (V.O.) (cont'd)
They’re blue and orange and yellow
and have poison in their wings,
just enough to stop a bird heart.
But the birds know this somehow, so
they don’t eat them. But there are
other ones, butterflies, they’re
orange, blue and yellow too but no
poison wings. They’re just flying
around, looking dangerous, getting
by on their looks.

Shepard enters wearing a TRENCH COAT.

SHEPARD
Mark. You ready to make the call?

He walks to a bank of phones adjacent to the pool. Whitacre
looks around.

WHITACRE
We’re gonna do it here?

SHEPARD
We can’t get a room, Mark. There's
problems with that.

The door to the pool opens and A GROUP OF DRIPPING WET
TEENAGERS run for the soft drink machine at the end of the
hall.

WHITACRE
I don’t know. It just kinda seems,
you know, awkward.

SHEPARD
It’s the best I can do right now.

Shepard takes a micro-cassette recorder out of his pocket
with a small microphone that clips onto the phone. He
demonstrates for Whitacre.

SHEPARD
Just hold the microphone on the
receiver. I’1l hold the recorder.

Whitacre looks around -- not sure if this is a good idea. He
holds the microphone to the mouthpiece as he talks.

WHITACRE (INTO PHONE)

SHEPARD

(whispering)

SHEPARD
On the receiver. Where you hear.

Finally getting it, Whitacre moves the mic.

WHITACRE
I’m on hold.

Shepard waves him off as he pushes the record button.

WHITACRE
Hello, Mr. Yamamoto. It is Mark
Whitacre...Hi, sir. How are
you?...No, I’m doing a lot of
traveling this week. How are
sales?...Certainly we need to, in
terms of our big customers,
definitely need to be thinking
about a good price, yes?

Shepard tries to read the response on Whitacre’s face. What
does it all mean? Whitacre nods.

EXTERIOR BEST WESTERN PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
Whitacre and Shepard are jubilant.

WHITACRE
“It's better to maintain a price of
$2.50 in other countries and $1.05
in the U.S.” Just like that.
There it is: price fixing.

SHEPARD
Well, this is great, Mark. This
verifies everything you’ve been
saying.

WHITACRE
Yeah.

SHEPARD
Thank you. Thank you so much.

WHITACRE
Absolutely.

They shake hands and go their separate ways. Shepard to his
Dodge Dynasty, Whitacre to yet another high end vehicle.

INTERIOR DECATUR CLUB - DAY
Whitacre eats lunch with MARTY ALLISON, 35.

WHITACRE
Marty, when you started work at
ADM, how much money did you want?

MARTY ALLISON
I wanted fifty grand.

WHITACRE
But, I went and told Terry, we
can’t get this guy for less than
seventy-five. I got it for you. You
were the first person I hired.

MARTY ALLISON
I know, Mark. You’ve always been
really generous with me. I

Here’s what I want you to do. I
want you to write down a name.

Marty takes out a note pad.

MARTY ALLISON
Okay. What’s the name?

WHITACRE

MARTY ALLISON
What is that, like a Nigerian name

Marty writes it down.

EXTERIOR ST. LOUIS STREET - DAY

Whitacre drives through snowy streets, the Gateway Arch in

INTERIOR ANHEUSER BUSCH LOBBY - ST. LOUIS - DAY
Whitacre enters with Andreas and Wilson.

WHITACRE

Andreas and Wilson wait for the elevator.

Whitacre hangs up abruptly and jogs toward the elevators to
join the others.

WHITACRE
OK, we’re all set now. Wait for
me.

INTERIOR ADM - DAY

Whitacre clips some papers together as he walks across the
office.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

Being able to do two things at one
is a big part of success. I try to
do abdominal exercises, isometrics,
even when I’m at a meeting.
Tensing. Holding. Then releasing.
I’1ll floss in the shower while the
conditioner is in my hair during
the part when you just supposed to
leave it in. Those things can
really add up to a significant time
savings.

INTERIOR KIRK SCHMIDT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

over. No more price fixing.

Shepard is confused.

SHEPARD
What? When did this happen? This

WHITACRE
Everything has changed. I got

Whitacre hangs up -- frustrated.
He walks over to a table in the club where a middle aged

Over the rest of their conversation...

WHITACRE (V.0.)

One of the Japanese guys told me a
story. This lysine salesman is in a
meeting with someone from ConAgra
or some other company. The client
leans forward and says, "I have the
same tie as you, only the pattern
is reversed.” Then he drops dead,
face down on the table. Alive --
and then -- dead. Brain aneurysm...

Mark rubs at the ink stain.

INTERIOR ECONO LODGE, DECATUR - EVENING

Shepard and Herndon are waiting in the most generic of hotel

the drapes at a sparsely populated parking lot. Herndon eats
a Granola bar and reads the side of the package.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

...Maybe everyone has a sentence
like that; a little time bomb...”I

and puts electrical clips on his fingers.

Herndon takes out a list of questions and watches Whitacre

The gluconate guy. He’s out of a

INTERIOR HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM (JAPAN) - MOMENTS LATER
Terry Wilson speaks with authority to the Asian executives.

TERRY WILSON
Before we even deal with Latin
America, we have to agree that we
are going to swap numbers. That's
the only way this is going to work.
Keep everyone on target. It’s
possible to do -- but we’ve got to
be very careful. We need to check
your phones.

Whitacre gets up.

WHITACRE
Excuse me. I need a comfort break.

He heads for the door.

INTERIOR HOTEL BATHROOM (JAPAN) - MOMENTS LATER

Whitacre checks under the stall doors to make sure he is
alone.

He takes the recorder from his suit jacket and talks into it.

EXTERIOR AMERICAN EMBASSY (PARIS) - CONTINUOUS

Whitacre gets out of the car and walks calmly into the
embassy.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
...-I get a letter from the CEO
every year thanking me. It’s a
form letter but it looks like he’s
really signing it. They probably
walk in and he signs like a hundred

Shepard meets him and ushers him through the lobby.

INTERIOR AMERICAN EMBASSY PHONE ROOM (PARIS) - MOMENTS LATER

Whitacre talks on the phone to Mick Andreas at ADM -- the
consummate corporate spy. Agent Shepard stands next to him,
taking notes.

WHITACRE
(into phone)
It went great. I think we’1ll be
able to keep it at a buck anda
quarter.

Agent Shepard sneezes loudly. Whitacre watches Shepard's
hands go from Kleenex, to coffee cup, to pen, to a tug on his
ear.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
Now what happens? Something you
breathe in on an airplane, some
bacteria, now it’s in his hands,

from his kids and now I’1l spend
the weekend with it in bed...

WHITACRE (V.0.)

Alexander will run a fever and who
pays for that? Where does the FBI
weigh in on that, as a cooperating

exposure to airborne contaminants?

In a stall, Whitacre sits on the toilet, fully clothed. He
flips the tape and talks into the recorder.

WHITACRE
Tape seven, side two. Chicago
O’Hare. Once again, Terry Wilson
representing ADM. Representing
Eurolysine, Alain Crouy and
Philippe Rollier. That’s a French
company.

He puts the recorder back in the ADM folder and looks down at
his feet. A piece of CANDY lays on the floor swarmed by ANTS.

WHITACRE'S POV

The candy is being carted away by ants, inches from his wing
tips.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
That's a big break, right there.
Absolutely. There's no choices to
be made. No debate. You're an
ant. You just eat it.

INTERIOR GASLIGHT LOUNGE, O'HARE AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

Wilson sits at a table with two FRENCH EXECUTIVES -- ROLLIER
and CROUY. The lounge did well in the 70's and has decided to
stay there -- most everything is covered in red velvet,
except for the waitresses -- they're covered in sequined body
suits and fishnets.

WILSON
We cannot have one section of the
world where it works and the rest
of the world where it doesn't. It

Whitacre returns from the bathroom. He puts the TAPE
RECORDER/FOLDER on the table. Wilson rests his cocktail ON
IT.

WHITACRE

We would obviously play the game.
But, the Koreans and the

Japanese...

CROUY
...They'll cheat.

TERRY WILSON

Then it won’t work.

WHITACRE

Well, you make it work in the other

divisions. Tell them.

TERRY WILSON (CONT'D)
Look, everyone has to share
numbers. It's so goddamn
simple. How the hell else
would you do it?

It's what we do in the citric
acid business and look at the
price of vitamins.

CROUY

WHITACRE (V.0.)
Terry doesn’t like me very
much...He’s got blotchy
skin...What causes that
blotchiness?? It must mean
something medical...He’1l
have a stroke and someone
will say -- “He was
blotchy...it happens.”

Let's not forget that if prices
went up in Europe it's because we
talked in Mexico first.

TERRY WILSON
That's right, you made it happen.

ROLLIER

It was our pleasure.

INTERIOR HAMPTON INN DECATUR - EVENING

Shepard has headphones on -- he's excited by what he hears.
Whitacre excitedly diagrams the world's lysine market on a
dry erase board for Herndon, illustrating the relationships.

A primer in corporate greed.

EXTERIOR WHITACRE DRIVEWAY - MORNING

RUSTY THE GARDNER blows leaves off the driveway. Whitacre
pulls out of the six car garage in a Lincoln Town Car. He
yells at Rusty over the leaf blower.

WHITACRE
Hey, Rusty, check this out.

Whitacre gestures to his briefcase lying in the passenger
seat.

WHITACRE
What do you think?

RUSTY THE GARDENER
It's a nice briefcase.

WHITACRE
But, wait. There’s more.

Whitacre opens the briefcase and pulls a secret panel to
reveal a TAPE RECORDER. He couldn’t be more proud.

WHITACRE
That is a Nagra SN. Had the bureau
custom make it for me -- Mark
Whitacre secret agent double 0
fourteen.

RUSTY THE GARDENER
Why double O fourteen?

WHITACRE
Cuz I'm twice as smart as double O
seven.

INTERIOR ADM CORPORATE JET - DAY
Whitacre sits with Andreas and some ADM SUITS on the COMPANY

Whitacre.

ANDREAS
Whatever happened to that girl who
was working for us -- didn’t she

move to California? What’s her
name, Tina?
AS PRODUCED 48.

WHITACRE
She’s getting married.

ANDREAS
My Tina is getting married?

WHITACRE
Two or three weekends from now.

ANDREAS
That won’t last for very long.
She’s a bit of a do-do head. She’1l
be back. I just hope she doesn’t
get pregnant. Fuck up her body. Oh,
she had a nice body.

Whitacre doesn’t respond. He’s wearing a wire.

ANDREAS
It'd ruin her tits. She’s got the
greatest tits in the world...

Whitacre looks out the window at white billowing clouds.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

When polar bears hunt, they crouch
down by a hole in the ice and wait
for a seal to pop up. They keep
one paw over their nose so that
they blend in. Cuz they’ve got
those black noses. They’d blend in
perfectly if not for the nose.

EXTERIOR JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, ORANGE COUNTY - DAY

Whitacre walks across the tarmac with Andreas and some other
SUITS.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

So the question is. How do they
know their noses are black? From
looking at other polar bears? Do
they see their reflections in the
water? And think, “I'd be invisible
if not for that.” That seems like
a lot of thinking for a bear.

Whitacre’s looks back and forth between the two men-- trying
to conceal his terror.

WHITACRE
You're kidding, right? I didn’t get

TERRY WILSON
He’s kidding. Relax, Mark.

ANDREAS
They don’t have the balls to mess
with ADM.

The men make their way across the lobby.

WHITACRE (V.0.)

When it’s over, the board of
directors at ADM is gonna
understand. They’re gonna see the
position I was in and that I acted
in everyone’s best interest, I
think that’s the only conclusion
they can reach. I mean, I’m the
youngest division President they've
ever had and I speak a number of
languages fluently.

The EXECS sit around the table eating the BAKED GOODS and
discussing business.

YAMADA
We already spent more than one year
to get better market situation in
lysine.

WHITACRE
We talked a little bit about it in
Paris, but we need to come to an
understanding on volume.
INTERIOR SURVEILLANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Shepard and Herndon watch video footage of Andreas.

Shepard struggles with the joystick that controls the
lipstick camera in the lamp -- his framing is way off.

HERNDON
We need a shot of these guys

Shepard tries to re-frame the group.

Ikeda goes over to the easel and makes a PIE CHART as a
visual aid for Andreas’ proposal.

..-Now the question is, if the
market grows, who gets it? If Kyowa
Hakko, Miwon and Cheil Corporation
each get two thousand tons, we can
divide up the rest. If we’re going
to have any stability at all...

Whitacre is distracted by a CLICKING SOUND. He shifts
uncomfortably. Andreas notices the sound and pauses.

IKEDA
We need some specific number.

ANDREAS
What would you be willing to
accept? Isn’t that the question?

YAMADA
ADM has already eaten all the
growth.

More CLICKING. Whitacre realizes his briefcase seems to be
the source of the clicking. He opens it. The CLICKING is
coming from inside.

INTERIOR SURVEILLANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Shepard and Herndon watch the monitor nervously as Whitacre
opens the briefcase with the hidden tape recorder.

INTERIOR CONFERENCE ROOM - MARRIOTT HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Whitacre removes the panel concealing the tape recorder,
fiddles with a pieces of the lining caught in the apparatus.

ANDREAS
You gotta remember we have a lot
more capacity than we’re using. We
could be growing twenty thousand

Whitacre is still fiddling with the case.

I can’t understand him.

SHEPARD
They have a board of directors and

HERNDON
If this isn’t an agreement, then
what are they all doing there?

SHEPARD
You’re getting bogged down with the
words. Just look at the actions.
Look what happens right here.

I’m just telling you -- from the

Herndon and Shepard are discouraged.

INTERIOR HAMPTON INN - AFTERNOON

Whitacre hands another small stack of tapes to Shepard and
Herndon. Whitacre has good news.

WHITACRE
We're having another meeting to
work out some issues in lysine.
We've got to divide up the volume
and set prices for some of the

SHEPARD
Europe again?

Shepard watches on a video monitor as Whitacre and other

another hidden camera.

TERRY WILSON (ON MONITOR)
Damn it Mark. Look at the size of

down and get us a bigger room?

INTERIOR SHERATON MAKAHA —- MEETING SUITE - CONTINUOUS

A medium-sized room overlooking the grounds. Iced tea and
fruit trays for the execs and an easel in the corner.

Wilson is right. The room does seem cramped for the number of
men assembling -- Whitacre, Mimoto, Ikeda and a number of
others from Asia and Europe. The men sit uncomfortably close
to each other. It’s all awkward.

WHITACRE
(to Terry, whispering)
There are a bunch of conferences.

TERRY WILSON
Will you call them, please?

WHITACRE
I will. Make yourselves at home
please.

CU ON THE PHONE BASE

Whitacre’s finger holds down the receiver switch. He’s faking

SHEPARD
Oh no.

They’re screwed.

Whitacre sees that the camera is blocked by Mimoto. He acts

Outside piss?

Language problem.

TERRY WILSON
It’s better to be part of the

Whitacre chimes in.

WHITACRE
What he’s saying is that the
customers are our enemy. The
competitors are our friend. Which
is why it’s important we have all
the lysine producers involved,
including the Cheil Corporation.

JM SUH of Cheil Corporation responds.

SUH
I want to know why we have been
excluded from association in the
past. We need to be part of this.
How can we know ADM will stay at
agreed-upon levels?

Wilson steps in.

TERRY WILSON
Well, it would be our preference
that we simply trust each other.
And if we find out someone’s been
lying, we'll just hire some Mafia
figure to rub you out.

Quiet laughter.

TERRY WILSON
That’s just a little bit of levity,
of course. But the point is that
if we can’t trust each other, it
ain’t gonna work.

MIMOTO
(to Suh)
You are okay with that?

SUH
Yes. I am all right.

So what are we saying?
Wilson looks at Whitacre like he’s an idiot.

HERNDON
We wanted to show you this. That’s
a picture of Mark Whitacre and his

The group passes it around.

HERNDON
We carry this with us all the time

as a constant reminder that he is a

the government stand behind him?

INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM —- MORNING

Whitacre looks in the mirror as he puts on a tie.

He sees

good things on the horizon. He buzzes with positivity. His

master plan is coming to fruition.
But Ginger sees it differently.

GINGER
Mark, are you an idiot?

WHITACRE
Ginger, I‘’1l be the only one left.
Mick will be gone. Terry will be
gone. Dwayne will be gone. I ama

qualified to run ADM.

GINGER
Mark, that’s completely illogical.
How can you possibly stay there
when you’ve just taken down the
company?
AS PRODUCED 59.

WHITACRE
Because they need me to run the

extremely valuable to the company.
And secondly, I did the right
thing. OK? The board is going to
see that. The board’s gonna respect
that.

GINGER
It’s the FBI, right? They're

at various locations and a CHART of which agent will contact
which ADM executive. Go time.

Shepard, Herndon, Mann and Mutchnik surround Whitacre
preparing him for what’s to come. He looks like a man about
to be shot into space.

SHEPARD
How’s your family doing?

WHITACRE
They’re good. They'll be at an

your move.

ROBIN MANN
Whatever happens tomorrow, I think
it’s in your best interest to get
an attorney who represents your

Whitacre is confused.

WHITACRE
You want me to get an attorney now?
AS PRODUCED 60.

HERNDON
No, not now.

MUTCHNIK
The first thing that’s going to
happen is the company lawyers are
going to come to all the executives
with a list of attorneys for you to
pick from. You gotta understand,
these attorneys are paid by ADM.
They don’t represent you. Do not
pick one of these attorneys. That’s
when you tell them that you have
your own attorney.

SHEPARD
You need to tell them that you're
cooperating with the government.

MUTCHNIK
It’s perfectly reasonable for you
to cooperate. It happens all the
time.

WHITACRE
I think I know a lawyer in Decatur.

SHEPARD
No, Mark. The town’s too small.

MUTCHNIK
I’m sure you’ve met lawyers in your
business dealings who can handle
this.

WHITACRE
Definitely.

He searches his mind for who that might be.

SHEPARD
Now, Mark, once this starts it is
going to be intense. They’re going
to know that somebody was on the
inside working with us. They’re
going to do almost anything to find
out who it is.

WHITACRE
You guys still think I’m going to
be okay at the company? Right? You
guys are gonna take down the bad
guys, but I’1l be okay.

He searches Shepard for reassurance. They’ve been in this

MICK appears in the headlights ready for a fight -- shirt un-

Gnats swarm around the yard lights -- crickets chirp out the

ANDREAS
We're going to the lawyers -- I

don't want to use the phones.

WHITACRE
See, the phones.

ANDREAS
They hit everybody -- my dad,
Schmidt, Randall...

WILSON
Fuck me.

ANDREAS
They played me a tape -- of me --
some meeting with the fucking
Japanese. I called the lawyers.
We're gonna go there.

TERRY WILSON
They played a tape? How the fuck
did they get a tape?

ANDREAS
I really don't think they have that
much and when you factor in
everything we've ever done for them
-- it'll be a ten year thing for
the lawyers, then a deal, maybe a
fine. That's all this is ever gonna
be. Trust me.

Whitacre stands with his co-workers. A tape recorder even
now spinning in his jacket.

An agent answers the phone.

AGENT TEMPLES
I just interviewed an ADM employee,

MUTCHNIK (0.S.)
Yeah?

AGENT TEMPLES
Schmidt knew we were coming. Says
he knew about the raid days ago. He
says Whitacre told him.

Mutchnik hangs up the phone. One unhappy guy in the midst of
a lot of law enforcement back-patting. He stomps off in the

EXTERIOR HOLIDAY INN PARKING LOT - LATER

Whitacre waits in his Mercedes drinking a Coke -- humming
happily. Herndon and Shepard’s sedan pulls up next to him.
The three men get out and stand in the parking lot.

WHITACRE
That was amazing. You guys should
have seen it. Terry was so scared
and Mick and the lawyers, they were
pissed!

SHEPARD
(sarcastic)
That's super, Mark.

But, Whitacre misses his tone. He continues on his rant.

The best part is, they think you
gave me the once over. They’re

HERNDON
Did you make a tape?

Whitacre again reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small
tape recorder.

WHITACRE
Yeah, I made a tape. A great one.
Really good.

He hands the agents the tape.

WHITACRE
So, it's over then.
Whitacre nods -- a moment to savor, until...
SHEPARD
Mark, who did you tell?
WHITACRE
What?
SHEPARD
Who else did you tell about the
raid?

Shepard is furious, he glares at Whitacre.

WHITACRE
Well, I had to tell my secretary.
Guys, I’m the head of the
bioproducts division. She has to
know how to get in touch with me. I
told her months ago. All I said
was, “Liz, I’m doing some work with
the FBI. I might be out of touch
for a while.” That’s it. She had
no idea about our case.

Shepard still glares.

WHITACRE
I’m pretty sure I’ve mentioned the
name Kathy Dougherty a time or two,
in my division. Kathy is a friend.
She is a trusted ally. I didn’t
want her to be scared.

SHEPARD
Why did you do that, Mark? Why
would you tell Dougherty?
AS PRODUCED 68.

WHITACRE
Because I didn’t want her to be
scared! I trust her! Guys, we can
trust Kathy!

Shepard glares in harder, his voice cracking. He knows
there’s more.

SHEPARD
Who else?! Don’t jack us around,
Mark.

WHITACRE

Mmm...Kirk Schmidt. Schmidty. Look,
I was afraid that he wouldn’t say
anything to you guys, that he would
clam up and not talk on account of
he’s loyal to me.

Shepard explodes.

SHEPARD
You could have ruined this entire
operation. Two and a half years...

WHITACRE
Has anything gone wrong? Has
anything gone wrong tonight?

Whitacre and Shepard are about to square off.

HERNDON
Time out. Mark, you know what you
did was wrong in our eyes. It was
supposed to be a secret.

Whitacre contemplates more excuses -- but before he can get
them out...

SHEPARD
Look, we can get past this. But is
there anything else we need to
know?

WHITACRE
No. No. Not that I can think of.

SHEPARD
Remember to tell them that you’re
getting your own lawyer.
Whitacre loses it.

WHITACRE

The success of the evening has been lost in the anger. The
men retreat to their cars -- Whitacre the successful mole in
his Mercedes. The agents in their non-descript Dodge.

INTERIOR ADM - THE NEXT MORNING

Whitacre strolls through the trading area amazed at the
mayhem he’s created. Documents are being carted away by the
arm load. Secretaries make frantic phone calls to lawyers.

Whitacre takes his secret to his office and sits at his desk.

INTERIOR WHITACRE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Through the glass wall the GREAT AND POWERFUL DWAYNE ANDREAS,
70, crosses the chaotic room, followed by Mick, Terry Wilson,
and two starched and suited men of deliberate bearing who can
only be LAWYERS -- AUBREY DANIEL and JOHN DOWD.

Whitacre’s eyes widen. Do they know? Dwayne enters -- cold
and formidable.

DWAYNE ANDREAS
Mark Whitacre, this is Aubrey
Daniel.

AUBREY DANIEL
Pleasure meeting you. I’m
representing ADM in this matter.
And this is John Dowd, a colleague
of mine. Dwayne has filled us in
on your responsibilities here.

They shake hands.

DWAYNE ANDREAS
Aubrey prosecuted Lt. Calley after
the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. So
this ought to be a cake walk for
him.

AUBREY DANIEL
We were hoping you’d have some time
to sit down and talk to John here.

MICK ANDREAS
ADM’s behind you on this, Mark.
Dad and I want the key people to
know that we'll be paying for all
your legal fees.

Whitacre relaxes.

DWAYNE ANDREAS
Then we'll let you fellas get

Okay.

Everyone leaves except for Dowd and Whitacre. Dowd gives
Whitacre a warm, knowing look.

How you holding up, Mark?

WHITACRE
Good. Please sit down.

Whitacre closes the door.

WHITACRE
John, can I ask you something?

JOHN DOWD
Sure. Anything.

WHITACRE
If I say something to you are you
allowed to say something to Mick
and Dwayne?

ANGLE ON WHITACRE’S OFFICE

From the trading floor. Whitacre closes the vertical blinds
one by one as he continues talking to Dowd. Whatever he’s
saying to Dowd seems to be taking more time than the script
the FBI laid out for him.

EXTERIOR ADM - LATER

Twilight. From the parking lot you can see two men still
talking in the fluorescent light of Whitacre’s office. Dowd
nods along with Whitacre’s tale.

INTERIOR ADM TRADING FLOOR - LATER

Mick, Terry, and Aubrey Daniel sit among boxes of pizza and
beer. The end of a day they would all like to forget. The
blinds finally open in Whitacre’s office. Dowd and Whitacre

emerge.

Dowd looks stunned. Hours and hours with Whitacre can do
that. Whitacre is solemn.

Wilson, Daniel, Mick stop what they’re doing and look up.

JOHN DOWD
No question about it.

Dowd and Daniel share a knowing look. An uncomfortable
silence follows.

WHITACRE
I’m sorry for what’s happened.

Whitacre shakes Mick Andreas’ hand and walks away like a
little boy who broke the neighbor's window.

ANDREAS
Sorry? What’s that?

INTERIOR MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Whitacre sits alone fully engrossed by the movie.

ON THE MOVIE SCREEN

The Firm. TOM CRUISE, as Mitch McDeere, talks with FBI agent
Wayne Tarrance, played by ED HARRIS at a DOG TRACK. McDeere
is wearing a wire -- he’s taping Tarrance, turning the
tables.

WHITACRE (V.0.)
It feels good to talk, to clear the
air -- you get to be like a balloon
after a while. A balloon looking
for a pin to bump into and relieve
the pressure. You could get sick
from keeping it inside and get a
tumor or something... I didn't ask
for that.

INTERIOR LAW OFFICES OF EPSTEIN, ZAIDEMAN, CHICAGO - DAY

JIM EPSTEIN, 43, and BOB ZAIDEMAN, 50, sit with Mark Whitacre
in their offices in the Loop. Whitacre recounts his life as a
mole in a rambling fashion -- leaping tangent to tangent. To
the uninitiated, his story challenges logic and belief.

EPSTEIN
So, there wasn’t a saboteur in the
beginning at all? You made that up?

WHITACRE
Maybe there was, there could’ve
been. ADM steals technology from
the Japanese -- so I wouldn’t put
it past the Japanese to do the same
thing to us. But once I told the
FBI that I’d made that part up they
said I had very little choice but
to be a cooperating witness.

ZAIDEMAN
And you began making tapes. How
many tapes did you make?

Whitacre moves his lips and mind in different directions.
The interior monologue takes precedence -- it’s taking over
now. The on-camera story we've heard before.
WHITACRE
There are over 200 tapes. I
carried a tape recorder
almost every day to work once
I signed a cooperating
witness agreement, and then
they gave me a special
briefcase that I took to
meetings that had a hidden
recorder in it -- they even
sewed a small one they just
developed into my suit and
I’d ride around on the plane
and tape Mick and the guys
talking about price fixing or
stealing technology and
illegal campaign
contributions, just whatever
we'd talk about.

WHITACRE

WHITACRE (V.0.)

There are so many really nice
people in the world. People
who want to help out. Good
neighbors. Good listeners.
Like when they have these
floods out on the Mississippi
and people lose everything
and are sleeping in a school
gym, someone always shows up
with a warm coat for the old
people and a homemade pot
roast. That’s why Ginger and
I bought that girl in town a
special computer after she
had the spine injury. That
kind of thing really makes a
difference. Jim here strikes
me as that kind of guy, you
can tell he’s the one-in-a-
hundred guy who when you come
into the emergency room, you
thank your lucky stars that
it’s his watch.

Then I’d come back. Two nights a
week, Brian and Bob and I would get
together and we’d work it. We’d

build the investigation.

Get what

we needed, gather all the
information. Then we went to DOJ,
briefed those lawyers and soon we
were hitting ADM, raiding the

place, taking it down.

Epstein can’t believe it.

EPSTEIN

And for how long did you do this?

Work as an informant?

WHITACRE

Uh, two and a half years.

a half years.

Two and

A moment of reflection and then...

WHITACRE

The lawyers look at each other.

I_ always thought there’d still be a
place for me at ADM when this whole
thing was over. I still have a lot
of friends there. A lot of friends.

Who could be that stupid?

They stifle their laughter.

I want you to know you can tell us
anything.

serious they might be. Okay? For
instance, what if a company gave an

corporate car. But instead of
driving it to work he drove his
personal car and gave the company
car to his daughter. Would that be
a problem?

HERNDON
That’s it? That’s the hypothetical?

What if it was a corporate plane
and the executive was using that
for personal use?

He slides the forged ABP documents toward Whitacre.

WHITACRE
Now where did we get those?

These are ADM documents showing the

INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Shepard, Herndon, Ginger and Whitacre. Mark looks used up --
his hair seems to be graying around the edges.

In front of him are a pile of newspapers -- Washington Post,
WSJ, Chicago Tribune, etc. Each with a banner announcement
of his predicament.

HERNDON
We can’t see you anymore and if you
call us and start to talk about the

SHEPARD
You can talk to us about your

ANGLE ON WSJ

7/13/95 headline reads: YOU DIRTY RAT, SAYS DECATUR,
ILLINOIS -- PEOPLE THINK MARK WHITACRE BETRAYED THEM AND ASK
WHY HE TURNED TO THE FBI.

SHEPARD
Remember, Mark, we told you it was
impossible to predict what would
happen when the case went public.

HERNDON
And you never told us about the
five million dollars you took...

WHITACRE
I don’t see what that has to do
with the price fixing?

Ginger has heard this before and she can’t hear it again.

GINGER
He worked for you for two and a
half years. He risked his career,
his home...And now you turn your
back on him and leave us out here.

WHITACRE
Ginger...

But the dam has burst. She sobs.

SHEPARD
The reason we came today is because
we’re concerned about your and
Mark’s well being.

Whitacre is sitting on the bed up and dressed when the alarm

WHITACRE (V.0.)

We took the kids one year to the
Renaissance Festival in Indiana.
You get to be the White Knight. The
kids get to ride a horse and joust
against the forces of darkness with
a helmet on. And the White Knight
always wins, the forces of darkness
fall onto an old mattress...

He stares at a PICTURE OF HIS FAMILY. His mind races ina
hundred directions. There’s nowhere to turn.

Whitacre -- in his hospital gown -- vanishes slowly, head

WHITACRE (V.0.)

...We were next in line and the
mare collapsed -- went down in a

drumstick and she dropped it in the
dirt. The kids were crying and I
remember this farmer saying he had
a gun in his truck. Just like
that. From the White Knight to a
gun in the truck. They had
everyone turn their backs before
they put the animal down. But even

Ginger has a cup of coffee with a psychiatrist, DOCTOR
MILLER, 60s, as they wait for Whitacre’s test results.

GINGER
He just kept buying things. We had
eight cars -- three of them we

never even used.

MILLER
And how else has he changed?

GINGER
I was always the one with the
temper and Corky was the happy one.
But that’s changed too. Since he
said he’d cooperate with the FBI --
he’s become so intolerant of
everyone...

MILLER
Why do you call him Corky?

GINGER
He’s had that name since high
school. He was like a champagne
cork always flying off somewhere.

INTERIOR PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE (CHICAGO) - LATER

Whitacre sits on the couch talking to Doctor Miller. This is

WHITACRE
There’s one in Hong Kong. And then

WHITACRE
I had an aunt who they used to say

I can’t be sure. My parents died in

This is your chance to put

the chance to redeem yourself, but
if you’re not going to be
completely honest just stop talking

WHITACRE
I understand that. And I want to

guy. And these are cases we know
we can convict. Forty-five counts
of wire fraud, money laundering and
tax evasion. Explain to us, where
is the wiggle room?

EPSTEIN
I’m not stupid. Mark committed a
crime. He stole nine million
dollars. That’s pretty
indefensible. But these guys at
ADM, they stole hundreds of
millions of dollars from innocent
people all around the world. Mark
showed you that four white guys in
suits getting together in the
middle of the day, that’s not a
business meeting -- it’s a crime
scene. And not only did he tell you
about it, he got the evidence to
prove it. When agents go under
cover for the FBI, they get trained
for the stresses of living a secret
life. We hear all the time how
easy it is for a trained agent to
crack. Here’s Mark, a civilian with
no training. But you guys just
shove him in there. You tell him
'go for it,' without any training
to make sure he doesn't crack under

...And the study said that people
had nice, sympathetic feelings
about people who were adopted and
treated them better. So I made up
this adoption story -- and people
did treat me better -- and when I
got a job one of my professors told
the people at Ralston Purina that I
was this amazing guy that had
accomplished all of this in spite
of being adopted --

Mark Whitacre with a briefcase when
Mark was cooperating with the

Walker is in full rant. He pulls out a letter.

completed three post-graduate
degrees while in detention. A

degree and another advanced degree
in the psychology of jury
selection. I sleep better in
prison than I have in years. My
wife has forgiven me and believes
that the ordeal with ADM has
brought us closer together in a
marriage of over twenty years. I
hope you will allow me to leave
here, so that I can rejoin that
life with my family and three kids,
two of whom are adopted. Especially
when you consider that thanks in
large part to my testimony the

able to collect over a billion
