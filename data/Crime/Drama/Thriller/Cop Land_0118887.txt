SHOOTING SCRIPT 6.3.96
Well it's Saturday night.

You're all dressed up in blue.
I've been watching you awhile.
Maybe you been watching me too.

- Bruce Springsteen
"tougher than the rest"
INT: FOUR ACES TAVERN - GARRISON, NJ - NIGHT

The walls of this suburban bar are lined with NEW YORK CITY
POLICE PARAPHERNALIA and FRAMED NEWSPAPER STORIES - tales of
police heroism clipped from the major New York Dailies.

A SCOTCH AND BEER MUG upon A 'LETHAL WEAPON' PINBALL MACHINE.
Danny Glover and Mel Gibson leap about a blinking triptych of
high octane police action. The score tallies into the millions.
Strips of tape line the side of the machine, noting high scores,
almost all of which are attributed to - .

FREDDY HEFLIN (42) EYELIDS HEAVY, LEANS LOW OVER THE MACHINE.
Fingers on the buttons, he paddles the silver ball skillfully.
A belly hanging over his belt, he is a slump-shouldered man,
puffy, wilted. Dull with booze, HIS EYES ARE FOCUSED ON -

A NEARBY TABLE WHERE - A HARD-JAWED WOMAN (BERTA, 38) AND A
BALDING BRIGHT-EYED MAN (GARY 'FIGS' FIGGIS, 44) sip drinks.
Both have the peculiar posture, gestures, and vocabulary of
N-Y-P-D, though they are in civilian clothes.

BERTA
- but this Armenian guy, he's from the
other side over there. 'Told her she's dead
- that she'll be dead by morning -

FIGS
uh huh.
BERTA
- so, he drops off this box at her
apartment -
FIGS
- and they call bomb squad -
BERTA
(nods) - and we X-ray it - on-scene. But I

can't see anything. So I cut a little hole.
And there's something in there.

Freddy nimbly holds the ball on the flipper, straining to listen
in. SENSING FREDDY'S STARE, BERTA GROWS UNCOMFORTABLE.

BERTA
Some white fuzz - and something pink.
But I can't figure what it is. And
I realize I'm looking at a tongue. A fat
pink tongue - sticking out at me.

FIGS
Shit.

BERTA
The guy put a goat's head in there.

Freddy sends the ball back into play.

Figs sighs and takes an NYPD ATHLETIC BAG from beside Berta's
chair. Though unimpressed by her story, Figs is always happy to
pontificate - and he does so - as he rummages through the bag:

FIGS
This in nineteen ninety six. H.G. Wells'd
roll over in his grave to think at the end
of the twentieth century - some Iranian -

BERTA .
- Armenian.
Figs snaps the bag closed, putting it down beside his chair.
FIGS

- some Armenian be delivering a goat's head
to the door of the woman that he loves.

BERTA
‘From a backward culture.
FIGS
Berta. We're all backward. Our machines are
all modern and shit - but our minds - our :

minds are primitive -
AN ATTRACTIVE PUERTO RICAN WOMAN (32) emerges from the rest

room, sniffling. From a distance, she is sexy. But as she
sashays behind FIGS, kissing his ear, we see her vacant eyes.

FIGS
Come on, Monica. Sit down.

MONICA
I want to go home. We gotta go to your
place ~- and I still gotta drive back to -

FIGS
I waiting on the call, baby.

FREDDY'S PINBALL DROPS INTO THE GUTTER.

The LED's blink "DEPOSIT QUARTER TO CONTINUE"
Freddy searches his pockets for quarters.
Berta's eyes meet Freddy's eyes, watching.

BERTA
Excuse me - Do you mind?

Beep! FIGS REACHES FOR HIS BEEPER, looking at the display.
He rises, finger in the air, waving off the tension.

FIGS
Ooo. Don't worry 'bout Freddy. Can't hear
from this side, anyway. Right, Freddy?

Freddy nods, stepping back from the pinball machine. Woozy.

FREDDY STANDS AT THE BAR - HE PULLS A BILL FROM HIS WALLET.
THE BARMAID (DELORES) through the FOOD SLOT, with the COOK.
FREDDY LOOKS TO -
BERTA, who lights her cig, watching Freddy.
MONICA hovers over the jukebox. Flipping the electronic menu.
FIGS stands at the pay phone by the door, on hold.
Freddy approaches Figs, unsteadily, dollar in hand.

FIGS
Quiet tonight, huh?

FREDDY
Yeah. (Everyone's) ‘At that bachelor party.
Across the river.

FIGS
"You celebrating long distance?

Freddy thinks a moment, numb with liquor, then shakes his head.

FREDDY
- Today's my birthday. (beat)
Um. You got any quarters?

FIGS
Happy Birthday, Freddy. So - Where's your
new girl? Your "Deputy."

Freddy shrugs.

FREDDY
Her Mom's. I - uh - I wasn't into
making a big deal, you know? After Ray made
the big racket - for the ten-year thing.

Figs nods, cradles the phone, reaching in his pockets. He pushes
through some change. A voice squawks on the Phone.

FREDDY HEFLIN fumbles with a LARGE RING OF KEYS.
HE UNLOCKS A PARKING METER. QUARTERS SPILL OUT INTO HIS HAND.
SOME ONTO THE SIDEWALK. Freddy kneels picking them up.

FIGS (0.S.)
‘Two kinds of people in the world -
- Pinball people. And Video game people.

FIGS stands in the tavern doorway. He smokes a cigarette.
Freddy looks up, bleary eyed, drunk.

FIGS
You - Freddy - are pinball people.

Freddy blinks, smiles. Figs looks to -
A SQUAD CAR at the curb. On the side, it says -

SHERIFF - TOWN OF GARRISON.
Figs crosses to the driver's door, beckoning Freddy.

FIGS .
Call it a night, Sheriff.
CUT AWAY TO:
EXT: GOLDFINGER'S TOPLESS NIGHT CLUB - MANHATTAN - NIGHT

WE ARE IN NEW YORK CITY.

The thumping of dance music from A NIGHT CLUB.

COLORED LIGHT POURS OUT AS THE SEAL OF THE DOOR BREAKS.

LOUD MUSIC RISES. WE SEE THE CLUB INTERIOR; A STRIPPER ON A
TABLE, ANOTHER GYRATING ON A MAN'S LAP. A CROWD OF MEN, SOME IN
UNBUTTONED NYPD UNIFORMS, HOLDING BEERS, BOTTLES OF SCOTCH.

STANDING ON THE STEPS - MURRAY "SUPERBOY" BABITCH (38), SHIT-
FACED - confetti around his neck. He shuffles through the lot
packed with CIVILIAN AND PATROL CARS - the civilian cars all
sporting Patrolman's Benevolent Association bumper stickers.

A HONDA sits in front of a hydrant. AN NYPD PARKING PLACARD
poised on the dash. Babitch unlocks the door.

A dull sound; muffled gagging.

Babitch looks into the darkness, groggy, squinting.

Music throbs. But there is something else, something near,
in the ungroomed bushes that run the perimeter of the lot.

Babitch pulls a FLASHLIGHT and PISTOL from his glove box.
He holds the flashlight, arm cocked over his ear.

THE BEAM FINDS - A BLACK COP IN UNIFORM, kneeling in the bushes.
He looks up into the light, his chin wet with vomit.

BLACK COP
Superboy.

BABITCH (SUPERBOY)
Russ? You okay?

The Black Cop (Russell) nods, waving Babitch off.

Babitch sighs. He turns off the flashlight and throws it - along
with the revolver - onto the seat of his Honda.

He starts it up, backing onto the street.

Suddenly; SMASH! HIS FRONT TIRE CRUSHES A BEER BOTTLE.
Babitch leans out his door, looking at the shattered glass.

BABITCH
Fuck me.

CUT TO:
INT./EXT. BABITCH'S HONDA - G-W BRIDGE ON-RAMP - NIGHT

MURRAY BABITCH drives, his head against the glass.
The radio dribbles sports scores.

THE BRIDGE APPROACH GLOWS blue-green under the mercury lights. A
tangle of pot-holed ramps and deserted vehicles.
Babitch slows, moving through a red light.

IN A LOT, THREE FIGURES MOVE EFFICIENTLY AROUND A CAR; ONE
STANDS WATCH BY THE BROKEN GLASS AS ANOTHER RIPS AT CABLES FROM
INSIDE, AND A THIRD PRIES THE TRUNK WITH A CROW BAR.

Disgusted, Babitch pulls onto the ramp.
SUDDENLY - krunch! - HIS HONDA IS SIDE-SWIPED BY A RED CAR.

Jolted, Babitch swerves into opposing traffic. He reels, glaring
out his window at the damage.

BABITCH
Mother fucker!

Honnk! - A TAXI'S LIGHTS FLARE, HEADING STRAIGHT FOR BABITCH.
Babitch twists the wheel, lurching his Honda over the shallow
concrete meridian, bottoming out, and back into his lane.

Up ahead, THE SPEEDING RED CAR, A MAZDA RX7, SNAKES CRAZILY,
MOVING OUT ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

BABITCH STEPS ON THE PEDAL.

HE PULLS UP ALONGSIDE THE MAZDA - THUMPING HOUSE MUSIC.
TWO BLACK TEENS, WILD-EYED, ON A JOY RIDE.

BABITCH GLARES, ROLLING DOWN HIS WINDOW.
HIS EYES MEET WITH ONE OF THE TEENS. BABITCH UNFURLS HIS BADGE.

BABITCH
N-Y-P-D! PULL IT QVER!

THE KIDS LAUGH AND THE MAZDA RIPS FORWARD. ONE OF THEM LEANS,
WAVING A_DARK OBJECT, aiming the barrel at Babitch. A GUN.

BAM! - BABITCH'S FRONT TIRE BLOWS OUT.
WIDE-EYED, BABITCH DUCKS - (assuming it was a gun shot) -

BABITCH
shit fuck piss! '

HE SWERVES, SCRAPING A CONCRETE DIVIDER.
BABITCH
(voice cracking)
Motherfucker! MOTHER-FUCKER!

BABITCH STICKS HIS PISTOL OUT THE WINDOW -
FIRING - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM !

THE MAZDA'S REAR GLASS SHATTERS. AND THE RED CAR SKIDS WILDLY
ACROSS THE BRIDGE. IT CAREENS INTO A BRIDGE SUPPORT. THUNK.

SMASH.
BABITCH'S HONDA SLAMS AGAINST A JUTTING CONCRETE DIVIDER.
HE HITS THE WINDSHIELD AND ROCKS BACK, HIS FACE BLOODY.
Steam rises. The bridge is quiet.

Bleary, FREDDY HEFLIN drives, straddling the double yellow.
HIS EYES ARE NOT ON THE ROAD - he stares longingly out toward -
THE LIGHTS OF MANHATTAN REFLECT IN THE CHURNING WATER.
Freddy turns back to the road.

A YOUNG DOE STANDS ON THE DOUBLE YELLOW - EYES GLOWING -
FREDDY'S CAR CAREENING TOWARD IT.

FREDDY SLAMS ON THE BRAKES - BUT - SCREEEEECH!
HE WILL NOT STOP IN TIME, THE DEER FROZEN IN HIS HEADLIGHTS.

FREDDY
Shit!

FREDDY JERKS THE WHEEL. HIS SQUAD CAR SKIDS OFF THE ROAD,
HEADING FOR A TREE. FREDDY DUCKS DOWN.

THE SQUAD CAR SMASHES THROUGH THE BRUSH
AND SLAMS INTO THE TREE. Foomp. Steam rises from the hood.

CUT AWAY TO:
EXT. NYC - GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT

A chorus of honking, sirens.

Dead traffic in both directions.

Vapor lights spray through suspension cables.
EMERGENCY VEHICLES, cherry topped.

THE MAZDA RX7 sits, impaled by a bridge support.
A PAIR OF MEDICS GRAB SUPPLY BAGS FROM THEIR AMBULANCE.

A RED-HAIRED COP (JACK COTTER) pokes over the medic's shoulders
as they tend to THE PASSENGERS - THE TWO BLACK TEENS :

THE DRIVER gurgles, his ear a sopping trench.
THE OTHER KID sits, his forehead sprinkled across the dash.

COTTER (THE RED-HAIRED COP) TAKES SOMETHING FROM THE CAR.
AN HISPANIC MEDIC nudges him out of the way.

HISPANIC MEDIC
Traffic incident. Bullshit, man.

The medic glances at the rear window of the Mazda.
It is shattered five times, from five small holes.

OTHER MEDIC
Nobody said they were popped.

COTTER shrugs, smug, wordless.
He drops A CRACK PIPE AND VIAL INTO A PLASTIC BAG.

ANOTHER NYPD, RUSSELL (THE BLACK COP) sets flares, his eyes
moving heavily from the accident to - THE GRIDLOCKED TRAFFIC.

A BARREL-CHESTED OLDER COP steps from the gridlock on the Jersey
side, a cell phone to his ear. As he gets closer, we see his
eyes. Deep blue. Saucy. His badge reads - LIEUTENANT RAY GLYNN.
Cops nod as he moves, unfettered, toward -

MURRAY BABITCH (Superboy), who stands slumped behind his SMASHED
HONDA, gesticulating wildly to A FAT COP (LAGONDA).

Short, pot-bellied, DETECTIVE LEO CRASKY (50) crosses, a
squawking radio in his hand. He meets eyes with Russell.

CRASKY
What you're thinking, Russell - swallow it.

RUSSELL
Hey. 'he saved five babies at Red Hook.

CRASKY
That's right. Black babies.
Mashed potatoes don't mean gravy.
cut TO:
ACROSS THE BRIDGE - BABITCH, LAGONDA & GLYNN - (CONTINUOUS)

CLOSE ON - BABITCH, his BADGE clipped to his jacket, a bandage
on his nose, eyes wet. He gulps for air, sucking a cigarette.

BABITCH

gonna be the fuckin' poster boy for the *
C-C-R-B. I'm dead. My life is fucking over. *
They're gonna string me up by my balls, Ray *
- just like Durkin. .
LAGONDA meets eyes with RAY GLYNN, THE SAUCY-EYED LIEUTENANT. .
Glynn takes Babitch's head, his thick fingers in his hair.
GLYNN
Listen to me. We ain't gonna let it go down :

like that. I'm here this time. Suck it up.

BABITCH
Durky didn't even get to the Grand Jury.

LAGONDA
Fuck the G-J. You're superboy. You saved
what - six black babies? That shit plays.

DETECTIVE LEO CRASKY arrives, listening to his squawking radio.

CRASKY
The car was hot.

Glynn nods, pleased.
Babitch stares, dull-eyed, at the sunrise.

BABITCH
Three babies.

CRASKY holds his walkie in the air. A woman's voice squawks.

CRASKY
- Miss DKNY says there's a jurisdictional
question. If it began on the bridge, it's
P.A. - if it began on the ramp, it's ours.

LAGONDA
- on the ramp.

CRASKY

(into his radio)
One at a time please!

(looking up)
I got I-A on another channel, the Mayor's
Office, Assistant D-A, Press up the ying-
yang; The only reason they're not here now
is we got gridlock - from Cross Bronx to
the Palisades.

GLYNN
We're lucky. We have time.

COTTER (THE RED-HAIRED COP) returns from the crumpled Mazda.
He whispers something to Glynn. Babitch watches them.

Glynn looks to Crasky. Crasky hands Cotter a set of keys.

CRASKY
In my trunk. In a Grand Union bag.

BABITCH
Guys. You don't have to.
I saw it. I heard the shot.

Cotter departs.
GLYNN

It was a semi, Murray.

where you will fuck your uncle and
everything we've built.

GLYNN

BABITCH
I don't drop dimes.

CRASKY
Yeah? How much blow you do tonight?
I heard they had a fuckin' brick.

BABITCH
Fuck you.

CRASKY
Fuck you. The black van's gonna be here in
a minute and I haven't done shit. What I'm

GLYNN
Sympathetic. It is.

CRASKY
It looks like I been standing on this
bridge popping pimples. But fuck-it, you're
Ray's nephew - “superboy" - saved ten black
babies - and I caught the case. I caught
the case and now I want it simple cause
this racial shit eats you alive -

GLYNN

It could eat all of us, Murray.

Crasky's eyes meet Jack Cotter's as he passes with a CRUMPLED

THE LIGHTS OF A SUBURBAN HOUSE FLICK ON.
SOMEONE STANDS ON THE PORCH, tentative.

PERSON ON PORCH
Hello?

FREDDY'S SQUAD CAR SITS THERE, steaming in the brush,

its front end wrapped around a tree, the driver door open.

The concert piano continues to play...

Off in the darkness, FREDDY sits at the river's edge.

Tears run down his cheeks. He faces the water and the lights of
the great city beyond. The water moves slowly, hypnotically.

A CAT WITH A BELL AROUND ITS NECK rubs against Freddy's leg.
Freddy pets the cat, his eyes moving again to -

THE CITY ACROSS THE RIVER. A SIREN SOUNDS and one can see the
lights of emergency vehicles on the George Washington Bridge.

Suddenly; SPIRALING RED LIGHTS MOVE ACROSS THE BACK OF FREDDY'S
HEAD, THE SIDE OF HIS FACE. THE SIREN IS HERE.
Freddy turns, wiping his cheeks.

A SHERIFF'S SQUAD CAR - WITH THE SAME MARKINGS AS FREDDY'S -
PULLS TO A STOP, ROADSIDE. A door slams.

A TOUSLE-HAIRED DEPUTY emerges. He wears a gray uniform. He
shines a flashlight on the wrecked car, and over the landscape.

DEPUTY
Freddy? It's Bill. Freddy.

FREDDY
Over here.

Bill (the Deputy) moves past the car, approaching -

Freddy, who wipes away his tears - and blood - on his sleeve.

HISPANIC MEDIC
No, it wasn't.

COTTER
Yes, it was.

Cotter moves to take the semi out of the car.
BUT THE MEDIC GRABS THE GUN BY THE BARREL.

COTTER
MOTHER FUCKER. HEY!

HISPANIC MEDIC
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

There is a moment of struggle, both men gripping the weapon.

AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE ~ CRASKY TURNS.
LAGONDA, GLYNN AND BABITCH stand behind him, watching the face-
off. LaGonda's sleepy eyes widen.

LAGONDA
Oh, shit...

Crasky clips his radio to his side, moving off.

CRASKY
Jesus Christ!

He waddles toward THE MAZDA, his hands waving.
Panicking, tearful, BABITCH steps backward, to the railing.

BABITCH .

He looks like he might throw up - or jump...

BABITCH
I'm going down, Uncle Ray.
Just like Durk... I'm going down.

Ray Glynn turns, watching the vehicles approach, his mind racing

THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW - A UNBLEMISHED SQUAD CAR pulls in

BILL GEISLER (THE TOUSLE-HAIRED DEPUTY) CLIMBS OUT.
He wears his gray uniform.

In his robe, smoking, FREDDY backs away from the window.

Bill enters the house without knocking. He holds a newspaper and
two covered coffees. He drops a grocery bag on the table.

Freddy brings spoons and two plastic bowls to the table.

BILL
(nodding to the bowls)
‘don't need ‘em. I got a variety pack.

Bill pulls a KELLOGG'S VARIETY PACK from the bag. He smirks as
he selects a mini 'Frosted Flakes' and cuts its face open with a
pocket knife, fashioning the box into a make-shift bowl.

He hands Freddy a mini 'Corn Pops' box.

Freddy looks at the little box suspiciously. He rips it open
from the top, and pours it into his plastic bowl. He takes
another little box - Fruit Loops - and pours that into his bowl
too. The two of them munch wordlessly.

Freddy watches as Bill pulls a DAILY NEWS from the bag.

FREDDY
How long's the car gonna take?

BILL
Lenny won't know - till the parts-guy gets

RUSSELL (THE BLACK COP) sits in a wooden chair that won't sit
level. It rocks, knocking on the floor. Nervous, he looks -

THROUGH THE DRAWN BLINDS - THE MEDICS sit out in the hall.

A few feet from Russell, A BLACK DETECTIVE (CARSON, 48) sits on
the edge of a table, looking at some notes on a steno pad.

Russell's eyes drift to - AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM SITS -
THE GREEN EYED MAN - DET. MOE TILDEN. He wears a white shirt,
sleeves rolled, and a bureaucratic tie. He listens.

CARSON
And why is that?.. Everyone else on that
bridge lives there. Is that a coincidence?
Bro? Or you just be the wrong color?

RUSSELL
‘Bro?' You in the 'Mod Squad'?
(nodding toward Tilden)
‘might as well be talking to him.

Impatient, TILDEN STANDS, crossing into the next room -

CARSON enters the war room. Approaches Tilden.
CARSON
Cotter's coming at nine tomorrow. I know.
You want Glynn. He says he's grieving for
his nephew. ‘That he'll come in next week.

Moe Tilden smiles. He reaches for the map, twirling his thumb
and finger on - A TACK PINNED IN - THE TOWN OF GARRISON.

CARSON
I don't know. If the guy's alive - he's the
fuckin plague, y'know? - why bring him home
with you? I mean - You don't shit where you
eat, right?

Tilden turns - his green eyes bright. He speaks quietly,
his jaw barely moving, smoke trickling from his lips.

SHERIFF FREDDY HEFLIN opens his puffy eyes. He wears a gray
uniform. He sits in the patrol car. He looks down as —

A FEMALE HAND withdraws from his thigh.

DEPUTY CINDY BETTS cups her newly freed hand over a RADAR

Cindy sighs. Thick armed, she is uncomfortable in her uniform

He holds out his wallet, unflapping it to reveal -

CINDY
You were on the job?

Cotter leans over from the passenger side.
COTTER
No - we're coming from Forest Hills, honey.
I'm John MacEnroe. That's Jimmy Connors.
Cindy takes the wallet from Glynn.

Freddy leans in the window of the Olds, from the other side. He
looks in the car at Cotter and Glynn. He notices - The Man in
Back - obscured - lying still.

FREDDY
‘This the new car, Ray? It's nice.
I didn't recognize it.

COTTER
Come on, Freddy. I want to go home.
Tell your cupcake to heel.

CINDY
Listen buddy. I'm not -

Freddy shakes his head at Cindy, cooling her jets. He backs her
off with his hand. She turns and storms back to the squad car.

The Oldsmobile lurches away and, as it does - Freddy notices -
THE MAN IN BACK RISING FROM HIS "SLUMBER" - STARING OUT THE REAR
WINDOW OF THE OLDS. The man wears a bandage on his nose - a
mirror of Freddy's wound. Except for the gauze, it is the same
face from the morning's paper - BABITCH (SUPERBOY) .

Freddy touches his own bandage, thoughtfully.
The Oldsmobile disappears round the bend, leaving Freddy
standing on the shoulder.

Cindy stands at the squad car, disgusted with Freddy.

CINDY (0.S.)
How do I know that guy?

Freddy turns with a start, closing the newspaper, putting his
hand - protectively - over the picture of Babitch.

But Cindy is looking over Freddy's shoulder at the snapshots on
his desk. She refers - sarcastically - to a photo of Freddy.

CINDY
Not bad for forty-something. 'Looks like he

Cindy knocks a basket of papers, reaching for the receiver.

Struggling to keep the papers from spilling, she knocks the

Freddy sighs, looking out through the window -

THROUGH THE GLASS - ACROSS THE STREET - A SUPERMARKET AND
A BURGER KING, under construction :

A BEAUTIFUL BROWN-HAIRED WOMAN (35) EMERGES FROM THE MARKET,
PUSHING A CART. Her hair blowing, a CHILD in her arms. The child
holds a PLUSH TURTLE.

The woman struggles to move several bags into her van and fasten
her child in a safety seat. She takes the plush turtle and puts
it on the roof of her van.

Dweeep, dweeep, dweeep...

CINDY

Cops in cherry-topped squad cars race through Manhattan.

Freddy's eyes wander back to the rear of the tavern where
voices are rising intermittently.

A shouting match breaks out between COTTER and FIGS.

FIGS
Bullshit. What is this, "Omerta"?

GLYNN
Sit down, Gary.

FIGS

Suddenly, FIGS LEAPS ACROSS THE TABLE, PUMMELING COTTER.
Everyone stands. More chairs fall backward.

FREDDY RISES FROM HIS STOOL.

HIS FACE BLOODIED, COTTER SUDDENLY DRAWS A REVOLVER,
waving it about wildly. LAGONDA STEPS BACK.

STILL SEATED, GLYNN WAVES HIS HAND IN THE AIR.

GLYNN
Oh, for Christ's sake!

BUT COTTER DOES NOT PUT DOWN HIS WEAPON. AND FIGS DOES NOT BACK
OFF, ignoring the gun pointed at his chest. HE TAKES COTTER BY
THE SHIRT AND SHOVES HIM FACE FIRST AGAINST THE DART BOARD.

FREDDY SHUFFLES FORWARD.

FREDDY
Hey, hey. Guys.

FIGS PULLS A DART FROM THE DART BOARD AND STICKS ITS TIP UP
COTTER'S NOSE, HOLDING HIS HEAD WITH A FISTED GRIP ON HIS HAIR.

COTTER
Owwwwwww! Jesus Chriiist!

FIGS
You got a problem - me helping a girl in
trouble? You got a problem with that?

COTTER
No. NO! You're a fuckin' humanitarian.

COTTER LOWERS HIS GUN, MOVING WITH FIG'S EVERY GESTURE, YELPING -
TRYING TO KEEP THE DART TIP FROM RIPPING HIS NOSE OPEN.

FIGS
You think you're so bad, little boy.

Figs presses Cotter's face against a portrait of a young blue-
eyed cop. The nameplate reads "Officer Chris Durkin’. *

GLYNN

Figs looks up, his lip bleeding, meeting eyes with Glynn.

GLYNN
Freddy, get him out of here.

FREDDY
Come on, Figsy...

Figs shakes off Freddy's hand with a spin of the shoulder.

FIGS

Ray. Don't shut me out. Okay. Yes - you're
still the big man - you found us a sweet
town. Got us the low interest. Finessed the
Rez requirements. Hey. I was grateful - I
am grateful - but don't forget who it was -
two years ago - who you came to - to cover
your ass - He was my partner, Ray. And what
we did to him - it was a bad thing.

eee eee ee

Glynn's eyes are flaming. LaGonda moves to stand but - with a
simple gesture Glynn keeps him in his chair.

Figs points to the portrait of "Officer Chris Durkin".

FIGS
It's not my fault you can't look at him.
You sit in that chair. With your back to
him. You want it to go away. But I'm still
here, Ray. In for a penny, in for a pound.
Just don't shut me out.

Figs moves to the coat rack, donning his P-D jacket.

Freddy follows Figs to the door. Everyone else watches, frozen,
until Figs, taking his sweet time, fixing his sleeves, exits.

But Figs spins around, facing Freddy through the cracked door.

The smiles disappears from Cotter's lips.
There is a silence. Freddy peels at the label on his beer.

COTTER
You know I'm the man, Ray.

Glynn looks up at Freddy. He smiles.
GLYNN

Freddy's my man. Unfortunately, he's on
the wrong side of the river.

FREDDY

With anything.

GLYNN

And I do. I do trust you, Freddy.
Freddy nods appreciatively. Glynn fingers THE DART on the table.

GLYNN
I trust you to keep the kids from killing
themselves on Prom night. I trust you to
suggest a good Opera record for my sister
at Christmas-time. I trust you to keep an
eye on my wife when I'm in the city

Glynn points the dart at Freddy.
Freddy squirms, glancing back at - Joey Randone, exiting.

GLYNN
Maybe I don't trust you with "“any-thing".
But I trust you with my home and my family.
And that's everything.

Glynn rises, crossing to the dart board.
He pushes THE DART back into the cork. The sharp tip squeaks.

Liz nods sadly.
Joey pushes away Bill's bandage. HE CHARGES THE DOOR.

Bill wanders about the porch, giving them space.

FREDDY sits, slumped, on the edge of his bed, taking off his

Freddy lies back on his pillow, sighing. He looks -

Freddy pulls open the door.
A LILY WHITE HAND EXTENDING to him from the driver's side.

A BEAUTIFUL BROWN-HAIRED GIRL sits, bent in the cab,

HE PULLS HER UPWARD TOWARD THE LIGHT.

Shivering on the bank, Freddy lays the BROWN-HAIRED GIRL in the
reeds. He looks out. He can see -

HIS CONSTRUCTION CO-WORKERS. Working.

Young Freddy screams - ‘Help! HELLLLLP!" - but nothing seems to
come from his lips. We hear nothing but the dull thumping rumble
of his heart - and the rising chords of a grand piano...

A TRUCK GUNS ACROSS THE OVERPASS. It too makes no sound.
A JERSEY STATE POLICE CAR PULLS TO THE EDGE OF THE OVERPASS -
lights swirling around silently.

In the distance, the contruction workers react to Freddy's
"silent" plea. They pause, looking out across the weeds. As does
a TROOPER, peering over the broken guard rail.

YOUNG FREDDY touches the side of his head, confused by this new
silent world. BLOOD DRIZZLES FROM BOTH OF HIS EARS AND HIS HEAD
(where he slammed against the roof of ice). Freddy wipes at his
ears, consumed with his injury. He looks to -

THE GIRL AT HIS FEET. Her body clings to her pruned dress.

Her skin is pale blue. But eeriely beautiful. Twisted to the
side, A SMALL STUDDED CROSS HANGS AROUND HER NECK.

It is LIZ RANDONE, young, beautiful, and lifeless...

A distant siren rings through the air.

Freddy steps back as -
FIGS - TEARFUL - kneels beside Monica down in the grass...

IT IS AN ELABORATE “TWENTY GUN" BURIAL IN THE TOWN OF GARRISON.
Everyone in full NYPD uniforms, medals pinned to chests. A sea

CARSON

may be law enforcement. So am 1.
But you are not a "cop."

Across the street - OUTSIDE THE FOUR ACES - RAY GLYNN, COTTER,
RANDONE, LAGONDA AND OTHERS converse in a huddle.

TILDEN
Now, I may watch cops. But - tell me if I'm
wrong - so do you. And because we are both
law enforcement. we share a duty. Where
there's a stink, we must investigate. We
must gather evidence. Because evidence
makes us see the truth. Is this the stink
of a criminal act? Or is it a turd ina
bag? No - listen to me, Sheriff. Everyday,
I see cops who lost their way. And I can
tell you - these lost cops - they are the
Minority - but they tend to gather. They
can be family men. Heroes. They can have
their reasons. But they are also the cops
who bring cases down. Addicted cops. Cops
who look the other way. Cops who plant.
Cops who beat. Cops who take. Cops who
kill. Their ambivalence is contagious. They
infect those around them. They are like
maggots. Where you find one - you often
find a nest. Now, I don't like this. I went
to the same fucking Academy. I stood by Ray
Glynn at graduation. He was a beauty. A
piece of work. And to the cop he was - to
his memory - I am loyal. But through the
fog of my loyalty - to the men - the
evidence makes me see. And these days -
what I see - like an island - out of my
reach - I see a beautiful island - shining
through this fog - every house financed by
one of two mob banks - uh-huh, that's
right, Sheriff - what I see is your town.

Freddy shakes his head. Tilden takes a deep drag.

OUTSIDE - GLYNN AND COMPANY disperse, some climbing into cars
and driving off. Glynn and Cotter head into the Four Aces.

TILDEN
That's why I want your help. Because you

traffic and the cats in the trees - there
isn't much here for you. To keep your mind

waiting for something to do. And here I .

BABITCH
I will. Thanks to Ray.

MURRAY BABITCH is at the door saying tearful *good-byes" -

Cotter puts his arm around Babitch, interrupting.
He smiles, but appears tense.

COTTER
Ray wants to see you out back.

BABITCH
Tell him fifteen minutes.

Cotter looks firm. Babitch is tipsy. There are a few more cops
waiting to wish Babitch well.

BABITCH
What? Tell him fifteen. I'm saying my good-
byes here.
Cotter moves off, pissed.

ANOTHER EXITING COP
They taking you away tonight, Mur?

BABITCH
I guess so.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. REDDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Freddy and Liz sit on the couch. Music playing.
Smoking. Sipping drinks. The tv running silently.

Liz holds the beaten up record jacket, examining it.
LIZ
This is pretty scratchy.
You can get C-D's - you know - in stereo.

FREDDY
Wouldn't matter to me.

Liz blinks, then gets it, touching her ear, smiling.

Oh. Right.

FREDDY
Isn't he great? He played like that -
so fast - without even looking at the keys.

LIZ
- like Ray Charles.

FREDDY
Yeah. Everyone thought he was a genius. But
he stopped doing concerts after that. Cause
he couldn't get it perfect, you know?

The music builds. Freddy conducts with his hands.

LIZ
Oh.

Liz watches Freddy in wonder. Barely listening. Buzzed.
Fascinated by him, not the music. She touches Freddy's ear.

LIZ
Which one is it?

Freddy smiles, trying to focus on the music...
wishing Liz would do the same.

FREDDY
The other one.
(pointing to the album)
Beetoven was completely deaf at the end of -
you know - his career. Gould had this funky
ear, too - See? 'Kind of a goofy looking
guy - But he was a genius, you know?

Liz sits up. She leans on Freddy's shoulder. Freddy stiffens.
She turns, her lips close to Freddy's bad ear. She whispers.

LIZ
You smell good.

FREDDY
Hm?

Liz smiles sweetly. A bit amazed with herself.

LIZ
Nothing.

Freddy blushes, unsure what to say - unsure of what she said.
LIZ

You know - it's a funny thing - when you
owe someone your life.

LIZ
Why is it you never got married?

Freddy turns. He looks deep into her eyes.

FREDDY
All the best girls got taken.

Tears drop from Liz's cheeks. They make a quiet popping sound as
they hit the record jacket in her hands. Freddy reaches, wiping
her cheeks. His eyes drink her in. A rumbling silence rises...

WE FLASH TO - THE MEMORY : AT THE EDGE OF THE WATER.

...the music continues...
YOUNG FREDDY leans down, straightening YOUNG LIZ'S HEAD,
brushing back her hair. Lifeless, she lies in the reeds.

He presses his mouth against hers.
He blows (so gently, the air squirts out the sides.)

No response. He blows again. Determined. And again.
Her belly swells. Her eyes flutter. She coughs water.

As the piano keys trill romantically -
Her eyes open weakly, slowly, like sleeping beauty.
Color blossoms in her cheeks.

Freddy leans away, smiles nervously, shaking. Blood drizzling
from his ear. He covers her with his jacket

In the distance, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS APPROACH, tentative, soon *
sprinting. THE TROOPER shuffles down from the overpass above.

THEY ENCIRCLE FREDDY AND LIZ.
They shout to one another but we do not hear them.
They look at bloody Freddy in wonder. The music builds.

BACK TO THE PRESENT - FREDDY & LIZ ARE KISSING ON THE COUCH.
Glenn Gould plays...

Freddy and Liz tenderly peck at each other.

Sweet kisses - each mirrors the last - his cheek, her cheek -
his neck, hers, the hair, the forehead. The kisses quicken.
Liz and Freddy build a tender rhythm but are somehow unable,
unwilling, to move further, like school kids, up against the
limits of their experience.

Suddenly, Liz backs away, self-conscious.
She puts the back of her hand to her mouth.

THE MARKED NAPKIN clinging to his drink. He peels it off the
glass, reading the scrawl. He looks up in the mirror, suddenly
terrified, the color gone from his cheeks.

COATS AND HOLSTERS are hanging on the shower rod.
Babitch takes a REVOLVER.

MURRAY BABITCH stands at the back door. Shaken.

IN THE SHADOWS, AT THE FAR SIDE OF AN ABOVE GROUND POOL, RAY
GLYNN smokes, tense. The water tower looms against the sky.

Babitch looks at the water tower - then - nervous — stumbles
down the steps, approaching the covered pool. He walks along the
perimeter, pausing suddenly, talking to Glynn from the opposite
side, looking about philosophically, terrified...

BABITCH
- You know, Ray. It's is a great thing you
did. Making a place. Where guys could stick

RAY GLYNN, COTTER AND LAGONDA STRUGGLING WITH BABITCH AT THE

Cotter and LaGonda recoil from the shots.
Babitch springs from the water -

BABITCH

JOEY RANDONE stands - horrified.

JOEY
What the fuck are you doing?!

Cotter runs off after Babitch. LaGonda follows. Glynn moves off

JOEY

Y'think I'm all that, Joey? No. You do not.

Lovely and strangely numb, she stands resolute and plain,
her hair blowing with the wind, her daughter at her side.

FREDDY watches Liz with obsessive interest as she solemnly
accepts everyone's good wishes."He was a great guy, Liz" "Don't
you worry about a thing". She finds comfort in Freddy's eyes.

Freddy can't stop staring at Liz.

Over his shoulder, distant, the old Garrison water tower.

CARSON

The "Sheriff of Garrison, New Jersey" is

Tilden's face is numb.

CARSON
Y'gonna tell him we're frozen?

Tilden thinks.
He smiles, wheels turning. He stands. Picks up a computer
monitor - still plugged in - and throws it in an empty box.

He tosses another box to Carson, who stands, puzzled.

TILDEN
Put your files in there.

CARSON
What?

TILDEN

Throw'em in. Do it. We're done.

Tilden moves along the desks of OTHER DETECTIVES, throwing files

Get the fuck outta here! All of you!

I-A Detectives shuffle out. Carson looks at Tilden, dumbstruck.
Tilden grins. Carson blinks.

TILDEN
Carsie - put your work in the box.

Carson reluctantly stuffs "Garrison" files into his box.

Tilden steps across the mess he's made, moving back toward his
office. He closes the door. He puts his feet up, checking once -
bright-eyed - over his shoulder as -

FREDDY HEFLIN enters the war room, nervous. He is taken aback by

Freddy is confused. He furrows.
Look. You guys were right.
Babitch is alive.

In the back office, TILDEN LISTENS, gleeful, snapping a rubber

CARSON
It's a little late, Sheriff. But -
Thanks for coming in anyway.
Freddy turns. Confused. He nods toward Tilden.

FREDDY
I want to talk to him.

Carson put his hand on Freddy, moving him to the door.
CARSON
Sheriff. Look around you.
It's out of our hands, now, you dig?

FREDDY
I gotta talk to him. It's important.

Freddy breaks past Carson - he opens Tilden's door.

FREDDY
Hey.

Tilden sits there. He refuses to meet Freddy's eyes, lighting a
fresh cigarette, turning his back on Freddy, facing the window.

Freddy is perplexed. Carson crosses to Tilden's door, pulling on
Freddy's sleeve.

TILDEN

Freddy speaks slowly, his eyes blazing with emotion.

TILDEN
Hear this. You blew it.

hand is a royal flush. You play cards with

GLYNN
Listen to me. I invited men - cops - good
Men to live here. And these men - to make a
living - they cross that bridge everyday -
to a place where everything is upside down -
where the cop is the perp and the perp is
the yictin.

Cotter smiles. He's heard this speech before and he loves it.

But they play by the rules. They keep their
guns in their holsters and they play by the
rules. The only thing they ever did was get
their families out - before it got to them.

(beat)
And you come to me - Freddy - with a plan.
A plan to “set things right". Everyone in
the city holding hands - singing "We are
the World". It's very nice. But Freddy -
your plan is the plan of a hoy. You made it
on the back of a match book - without
thinking - wi i :
And you say - "come in with me, Ray - bet
your life on this hand" - and I look at the
cards - and I see nothing. I see Superboy
crucified. I see this town destroyed. I see
the death of everything we've built,
Freddy. That's not what you want, is it?

FREDDY
Ray. I look at this town -
And I don't like what I see anymore.

Glynn stands, eyes flaming.

GLYNN
Whe the fuck do you think you are?

FREDDY
I'm the Sheriff of Garrison, New Jersey.

LAGONDA
The grass hasn't even taken root above
Joey's grave, you fuck.
COTTER PUTS HIS GUN ON THE TABLE. Playing with it.
COTTER
‘you feel like a cop now, Freddy, sticking
it inside a cop's widow?
Some of the other cops are getting uncomfortable. A few leave.

COP #1
I'm outta here, Ray.

COP #2
Yeah. This is too rich for me.

CINDY AND BILL ARE FROZEN - TORN...
FREDDY'S HAND TOUCHES HIS HOLSTER. Cindy looks away.

Freddy. You got him at the station?
Freddy says nothing.
GLYNN
Just drop the keys. Maybe they fell out of
your pocket. Or maybe Cindy's. And you go
ome and you sleep. And you wake up - and
you guide that traffic through town -
Tears well in Freddy's eyes.

GLYNN
- and everything will be the way it was.

Freddy looks at the clock on the wall.
FREDDY
Um. I'm leaving at six. That's in a few
hours. I'd like you to come with me, Ray.
Bill joins Freddy, hesitant. Glynn wilts.

GLYNN
There's nothing I can say?

Freddy looks up solemnly.
Glynn puts his hands in the air. Crafty.

GLYNN
Okay, then. Six it is. It's a date.

Freddy blinks, stunned. Cotter and LaGonda glare at Glynn.

FREDDY -
Okay. I'll see you then.

Freddy shuffles, uneasily, toward the door. Bill follows.

Freddy looks to Cindy. She turns to Cotter - torn.
She shakes her head, tearful.

Freddy pulls the door shut.

INT. STATION HOUSE - NIGHT
BABITCH sits, pacing in his cell.

TWO SHOTGUNS on the table, FREDDY sits slumped, facing the
windows of the station. BILL paces, on the phone.

- No, honey. I'm telling you - Because I
can't just leave him here.
Bill hangs up the phone. Slowly.
The second hand on the clock sticks. It is four thirty.

Bill glares out the window. A CAR IDLES OUTSIDE... watching...

FREDDY
Go home, Bill.
BILL
(tortured)

I mean. I want to be here for you, Freddy.
But... Lisa's nervous. She's pregnant. I
mean. There's a reason I never applied to
the city, you know? This is your thing.

FREDDY
So, go on. I'm gonna be fine. (smiles)
They're not going to kill me.
Babitch mutters in the bg. Bill moves to the door. He turns.

BILL
Why don't you just go now?

FREDDY
I told him I'm leaving at six.
Besides. They're out there already.
BILL
(nodding)
Take care, Freddy.

Freddy nods, weary. Bill exits.
Babitch puts his head in his hands.

119 INT. FIG'S CHEVY - NJ TURNPIKE - NIGHT

Driving, music blasting, his car piled with belongings, GARY
'FIGS' FIGGIS keeps staring at himself in the driver's mirror.

FIGS
Shut the fuck up, would you please?
But Figs looks once more and - with a sigh - hits the brakes.

FIG'S CHEVY screeches to a stop in the deserted turnpike.

Birds sing. The mud-yellow sun rises over the distant city.
The second hand sticks, then moves on. A few minutes to six.

Freddy wakes with a start. He peers out the window.
The street is empty. Desolate. The car from last night - gone.

FREDDY
Oh, well.

He takes A SHOTGUN.
He opens Babitch's cell. Babitch is sitting there, groggy.

FREDDY
Come on. We're going.

CUT TO:
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAWN
The bank clock blinks - 5:58 am, 5:58 am, 5:59 am.
FREDDY and BABITCH exit the station.
They round the corner, walking in the alley behind the Sheriff's
Office toward - FREDDY'S PARKED SQUAD CAR.
Freddy stops in his tracks. The tires have been slashed.

BABITCH
Oh God.

A HAND REACHES FROM BEHIND FREDDY, taking his shotgun.
He feels the cold press of steel against his head.

COTTER
Get down.

Jack Cotter pushes Freddy down on his knees.
LAGONDA takes Babitch. Cotter pushes Freddy's back.

COTTER
I said - get down, Freddy.

Color washes from Freddy's face as he gets down on all fours.

FREDDY
Jesus. Guys. You don't want to do this.

THE MUZZLE OF A GUN TOUCHES FREDDY'S EAR.

COTTER
This is the good one, right?

Freddy nods. HE CLOSES HIS EYES. HE HEARS THE TUMBLER CLICK.
HE HEARS THE HAMMER PULL. CRACK!

The gun fires, not into Freddy’s head, but .
Freddy rolls to the pavement, powder burns covering his ear,
blood trickling from the canal.

Delirious with pain, Freddy looks up as —

COTTER AND LAGONDA LOAD BABITCH INTO A CAR.

Since the gunshot — all we can hear is a ringing sound.
A low distant piano, and Freddy's racing heartbeat.

THEY ROAR UP THE ROAD, TOWARD THE HOUSING TRACTS ON THE HILL
leaving Freddy alone, deaf and bleeding on the roadside.
He struggles to stand. He collapses to his knees.

EXT. ROAD UP THROUGH THE TRACT HOUSES - EARLY MORNING

The rumble and piano continue to build.
Smacked with dawn light, Manhattan glimmers across the river.

AT A NEATLY KEPT HOUSE - COP #1 - in his robe - takes his
morning paper from the stoop. He notices -

Stumbling up the center of the road —

SHERIFF FREDDY HEFLIN, blood trickling from his ear, running
down his neck, soaking his shirt. His face is pale and haggard,
the powder burn smeared over one side of his head.

SHOTGUN IN ONE HAND, REVOLVER IN THE OTHER, FREDDY LOOKS LIKE A
WESTERN GUNFIGHTER, his eyes glazed with anger, his face stone.

They meet eyes. The cop closes his door.

Freddy trudges on. Up the steep hill.
Past the mailbox that reads - RANDONE...

THE DOBERMAN ON THE CHAIN BARKS SILENTLY AT FREDDY...

JACK COTTER POINTS HIS FINGER AT FREDDY - SAYING SOMETHING -
SCREAMING A BARRAGE OF UN-HEARD INSULTS AND WARNINGS...

GLYNN AND CRASKY PULL BABITCH - KICKING AND SCREAMING -

FIGS and FREDDY emerge with BABITCH.

In the golden light, A CROWD OF STUNNED COPS IN ROBES AND

BABITCH
He's deaf. They shot out his ears, man.

Freddy pulls to a stop at the TOLL BOOTH.
Freddy hands THE TOLL TAKER three bucks.
The toll taker is nonchalant. Oblivious to the blood all over.

As Freddy pulls the car through through the mechanical arm and
out onto the bridge, Figs shakes his head in wonder.

BABITCH

crazy. He is. He's fuckin’ nuts.
Figs turns, meeting Babitch's eyes. Figs smiles.

FIGS
No. He's a cop.

Driving across the bridge, oblivious, Freddy glances at Figs.
Figs puts a spinning red light on the dash and flicks it on.

Freddy smiles a weary smile.

WIDER - THE GREAT GRAY BRIDGE - MANHATTAN TO THE OTHER SIDE -

From somewhere - a piano rises - lilting, romantic and strong.
