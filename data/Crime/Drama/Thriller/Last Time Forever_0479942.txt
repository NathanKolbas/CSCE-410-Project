BLACK.

WOMAN (V.O.)
You can't trust anyone...

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

A cheap short-stay motel room. A strip of daylight shows
between drawn curtains at one of the windows. A woman is
sitting on the edge of the bed, her back to us. She's on
the phone. We track slowly toward her as she speaks.

WOMAN
(into phone)
There was a time when I
trusted my husband, but I
can't anymore.
(listens)
I think he's seeing another
woman.
(listens)
Well, I'm told that you're
very good at what you do.
(listens)
That's fine. What time?
(listens)
Okay. I'll be there.

We are in a close shot now. The woman hangs up the phone
and turns around, and we see her face. She's beautiful.
She's in her early thirties, very well-put together. Her
name is GLORIA CONOVAN.

GLORIA
How was I?

Sitting in a chair, across the room, in the corner, is a
man. His suit jacket is draped over the arm of the chair
and his tie is loosely knotted. He has a wary look. He's
about thirty-five. His name is JOHN MACDONALD.

JOHN
.-.Good.

He lights a cigarette.

GLORIA
Can I have one of those?

JOHN
I thought you quit.

GLORIA
(smiling)
I guess I'm just not good at
giving things up.

She rises from the bed and crosses the room.
He shakes a cigarette loose from the pack.
She takes it, holds it up to her lips.

He lights it for her.

She smokes in slow, steady pulls.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
I really am trying to quit.

JOHN
I can see that.

GLORIA
(smiling)
It doesn't count if someone
else lights it.

She goes to the bureau, primps in the mirror, surveys
herself critically, is reasonably satisfied.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
...Something wrong?

JOHN
I'm just thinking. Someone you
know could drive by and see
your car.

GLORIA
No one I know ever comes up
here. Why -- you afraid we'll
get caught?

JOHN
Maybe.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
GLORIA
Really?

JOHN
Aren't you?

She makes a careless gesture with her cigarette, flicks
the ashes into an ashtray.

GLORIA
No.
JOHN
Maybe you should be.
GLORIA
(playfully)
You think someone's following
you?
JOHN
That's cute.
GLORIA
(teasing)

Your ex-wife, maybe?

JOHN
Please.

GLORIA
Another woman?

JOHN
(unsmiling)
There are no other women. Only
you. Besides, I don't think
you're in a position to be
jealous.

GLORIA
(archly)
Who says I'm jealous?

JOHN
I do.

She gives him a sly smile.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
GLORIA
I think you're putting words
in my mouth.

He's a little annoyed.

JOHN
So you wouldn't mind if I was
seeing other women?

GLORIA
(still playing)
Are you gonna cross-examine
me, counselor?

JOHN
I'm serious.
GLORIA
Okay, fine. I might.
JOHN
You "might" -- what does that
mean?
GLORIA

Is that a rhetorical question?

JOHN
No.

She blows a slanting plume of smoke. It swirls around her
head.

GLORIA
It means you're having an
affair with a married woman.

JOHN

Does it ever bother you?
GLORIA

What.
JOHN

That you're married.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
GLORIA
(smiling)
Does it bother you?

He takes a deep drag on his cigarette and then crushes it
out in the ashtray.

JOHN
I should get back to the
office.

She stubs out her cigarette and sits down on the bed. She
gives him a languishing, inviting look.
GLORIA
You don't really want to go
out into that heat, do you?

He stares at her, absorbing the lines of her figure, the
slim legs sheathed in silk stockings.

JOHN
It's not much cooler in here.

She slides her skirt up her thighs, revealing the creamy
flesh between her stocking tops.

GLORIA
What'1l I do with myself?

He drifts toward her.

JOHN
You could go home to your
husband.

GLORIA

I will. Just not yet.

She reaches for him, pulling him down onto the bed. They
tug at each other's clothes, kissing deeply.

JOHN

Why do I keep taking these
chances?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
GLORIA
Because...you can't help
yourself.

CREDIT SEQUENCE. 2
EXT. RACETRACK - MIAMI - DAY 3

A concrete grandstand with a tacky, art-deco look.
Gloria's Mercedes convertible turns into the parking lot.

Gloria parks, gets out, looks around. She has dark
sunglasses on.

BEAUMONT (0.S.)
Mrs. Conovan?

She turns.

At the end of a row of cars, a stout, florid man in his
early fifties is standing next to a well-battered Crown
Victoria. He's dressed in a rumpled summer weight suit
and a wide-brimmed Panama hat. He has the face of a man
who's seen things. This is NED BEAUMONT.

Gloria approaches him.

He smiles. There's something oily and smooth about him.
He extends a fat pink hand.

She shakes it.

He walks around the car and opens the passenger side
door.

She gets in.

INT. BEAUMONT'S CAR - DAY 4
It's a mess. Paper napkins on the floor, a bottle of No

Doz, a few soda cans, a couple of those little cartons
take-out burgers come in.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
Beaumont settles himself into the driver's seat and looks
over at Gloria.

She twists her lips, showing her distaste.

BEAUMONT
(noting her
expression)
I work out of my car.

GLORIA
I never would've guessed.
BEAUMONT
Thought this would be more
private.
GLORIA
You meet all your clients
here?
BEAUMONT

Well, I spend a lot of time
here. I like watching the dogs
run.

(a beat)
I take it you've never been to
the races.

GLORIA
No.

BEAUMONT
It's a funny thing. The dogs
chase this mechanical rabbit
around the track, but they can
never catch it. They just keep
chasing it around in circles.
You'd think maybe with a
little luck one of ‘em might
catch up to it, but it always
gets away.

She turns and gazes out the window.
GLORIA

I've never been a great
believer in luck.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
BEAUMONT
Okay, then. Let's talk about
what you believe in.

GLORIA
I believe my husband's having
an affair.

BEAUMONT

Well, what you believe and
what you can prove are two
different things. What makes
you so sure?

GLORIA
(evenly)
A wife can tell.

BEAUMONT
How long've you been married?

GLORIA
Ten years.

BEAUMONT
Has he been unfaithful before?

GLORIA
...Yes.

He fixes his small, shrewd eyes on her.

BEAUMONT
But you didn't have him
followed.

GLORIA
No.

BEAUMONT
Why now?

GLORIA
I never had a reason to leave.
(a beat)
Now I do.

BEAUMONT
...-John recommended me?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
GLORIA
Yes. I didn't think there were
private detectives anymore,
except on TV.

BEAUMONT
Well, it's not what you think.
A lot of the time I just sit
in my car and stare at motels.
Last night I was parked
outside a motel for five
hours, waiting for a lady's
husband to come out with his
girlfriend. My eyes're still
bleary with neon. Got some
good pictures, though.

In the closeness of the car, he is starting to sweat. He
digs into his pocket, takes out a sodden handkerchief,
blots his forehead with it.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)

You know if you come to the
track at night, they don't let
you take pictures. They say it
spooks the dogs. I don't know
why. They're so involved in
what they're doing, I hardly
think they'd notice.

She's not really listening. She reaches into her handbag
and comes out with a manila envelope. She hands it to
him. He tucks it into his jacket.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
You included a recent picture,
and addresses?

GLORIA
Yes.
(a beat)
..-And this is strictly
confidential?

BEAUMONT
‘Course it is.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
Now, I oughta shove off. I
have a lot of getting around
to do, and I don't want to
rush.

She looks at him coolly and gets out of the car, leaving
the door open. He stares at it for a moment, then leans
over and pulls it shut.

EXT. STREET - NORTH MIAMI - DAY
A seedy two-part commercial block.

A late model Dodge coupe pulls over to the curb. John
gets out. He shrugs his jacket on as he heads into a
small office building.

INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY
A cheaply furnished reception room.

John comes in. His secretary, SUSAN, is sitting behind
the desk. She's a lanky, sunburned girl, barely past
twenty.

JOHN
(brusque, but not
unpleasant)

Any messages?

She pushes a phone message slip toward him.
SUSAN
The judge postponed your
alimony hearing another twenty-
one days.
He picks up the message slip.

JOHN
Anything else?

SUSAN

...I called to order those
office supplies?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary

JOHN
Uh-huh --
SUSAN
(hesitantly)

-- and they said that your
account was past due. They
wouldn't accept any new
charges.

JOHN
(nonplussed)
All right. I'll pick them up
myself.

He heads into his private office. She gathers her things.

SUSAN
Should I bother coming in
tomorrow?

JOHN
Yeah. Half day.

INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - DAY 7

A cramped office with a busy, cluttered look. Bookshelves
lined with legal codes, a couple of file cabinets, stacks
of legal pads, a Dictaphone recorder.

John sits at his desk, which is covered with work he
hasn't gotten to. He's on the phone. The sun cuts through
the blinds behind him in glaring strips.

JOHN

(into phone)
Believe me, I'm aware of that,
but this is my divorce here...

(listens)
I handled it myself, so I know
the alimony's subject to
review.

(listens)
Because I'm the one who put in
the provision that says the
court has to re-examine it.

He swivels his chair toward the window, squints, closes
the blind slats.

JOHN (CONT'D)

(into phone)
That's fine, but they still
have to rule on whether the
payments should be
discontinued.

(listens)
I don't think you understand.
I've reached the point where
I'm sending her everything I
make, and I can't do it
anymore.

(listens)
Well, if she's working, she
doesn't need it -- she's self-
sufficient.

(listens)
Okay, I don't have time for
this. I have too much to do.
You know where to reach me.

(listens)
Yeah, ‘bye.

He slams the phone down.

EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
A parking lot that overlooks the water.

Beaumont's car is parked at the water's edge.

INT. BEAUMONT'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

He's tucking into a hamburger. He has some fries spread
out on a paper napkin on the dashboard, a cup filled with
soda in the cup-holder. There's a heap of napkins on the
passenger seat.

He looks out the window.

John's car pulls up, stops. John gets out and approaches.

Beaumont rolls his window down.

BEAUMONT
Get in.

John glances into the car.

JOHN
...Why don't we talk out here.

BEAUMONT
I'm eating.
(a beat)
You want some fries?

JOHN
No.

BEAUMONT
All right. I'm almost
finished.

JOHN
Finish out here.

Beaumont gets out of the car, the burger in his hand.

BEAUMONT
You're in a good mood.
(a beat)
What's the matter -- you fall
short on your alimony again?

JOHN
What makes you say that?

BEAUMONT
I'm a private investigator.
It's my job to know these

things.
JOHN
Right.
(a beat)

-..You meet with Mrs. Conovan?

BEAUMONT
Uh-huh.

JOHN
What'd you think?

BEAUMONT
She's an eyeful.

You two an item?

JOHN
I'm not gonna dignify that
with an answer.

BEAUMONT
(smiling)
You could dignify it with a

no.
JOHN

(all business)
.--How long's it gonna take?

BEAUMONT
Depends on how long it takes
her husband to make a mistake.

JOHN
Shouldn't be too long.

BEAUMONT
How do you know?

JOHN
(a slight smile)
I'm a divorce attorney. It's
my job to know these things.

Beaumont bolts down the last of his burger, then wipes
the grease off his hands with a napkin. He bunches the
napkin up and tosses it onto the ground.

JOHN (CONT'D)
(suddenly serious)
What're you doing?

BEAUMONT
What do you mean?

JOHN
Pick that up.

BEAUMONT
Are you serious?

Pick it up.

Beaumont looks at John, realizes he's serious. With a
sigh, he bends down, picks up the napkin, stuffs it into
his pocket.
BEAUMONT
(slightly amused)

You always like this?

John turns, heads to his car.
JOHN

I don't like it when people

don't clean up after

themselves.
EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - COCONUT GROVE - LATE AFTERNOON 10
Modest Spanish-style houses. John's car swings into the
driveway of a stucco house with a tile roof.
INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 10A
John comes in, throws his jacket across a chair, sets his
briefcase down.
INT. JOHN'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON 10B
John opens the refrigerator and stands there for a
moment, trying to cool off. He pulls a beer off the rack.

INT. JOHN'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 10Cc

John walks over to the window, looks out, loosens his
tie, sips his beer.

INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 11

John looks at his reflection in the mirror. He turns the
faucet on, gets a handful of water, splashes it on his

face. The water runs down his chin and drips. He looks at
himself again. A smile pulls at the corners of his mouth.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - MIAMI - DAY 12

A street lined with mirrored, shimmering buildings.
Expensive condominiums and soaring commercial structures.

Beaumont sits in his car, eyes fixed on the entrance of a
tall office building across the street. He wears a
desultory shave. His clothes are limp, unfresh. There's a
half-eaten sandwich in a wrapper on the dashboard.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
16

TOM CONOVAN strides out of the building. He's a
powerfully built man in his fifties, nicely dressed in a
well-cut suit. He's carrying an expensive attache case.

He looks up and down the crowded street, then starts
walking. After a moment, he blends in with dozens of
other people. Men in tailored suits and women in stylish
dresses.

Beaumont jots a few notes on a small pad. Sweat glistens
on his round cheeks.

EXT. CONOVAN HOUSE - CORAL GABLES - LATE AFTERNOON 13
A golden-hued mansion fanned by towering palm trees.

Gloria's Mercedes is parked in the driveway. Tom's
Cadillac convertible pulls in next to it.

EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 14

A wide sweep of emerald grass. Sunlight glitters off a
spectacular pool.

Gloria is in the water, swimming laps. She swims with a
perfect crawl and a powerful kick.

Tom comes out, walks down to the end of the pool. There's
a glass-topped table with an umbrella and several deck
chairs. He eases himself gingerly into one of the chairs
and watches Gloria.

She does a barrel turn, swims another length, and then
climbs out of the pool. She's wearing a skintight racing
style swimsuit, one piece, cut high on the legs. Water
glistens off her lean, athletic body. She grabs a towel,
pats herself dry.

GLORIA
You're home early.

TOM
Got a meeting tonight, wanna
change clothes.
(conversationally)
That a new suit?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary

GLORIA
No.

She gathers her wet hair in both hands, sweeps it up off
the nape of her neck.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
Got time for a swim?

TOM
No, I should go.

He rubs his eyes. He's tired.

GLORIA
-.-What is it?

TOM
Ah, it's this new high-rise.
We're scheduled to break
ground in about a month, but
the construction loan hasn't
closed yet.

GLORIA
Can't you just postpone the
ground-breaking?

TOM
It's not that simple.

GLORIA
(smiling thinly)
Right. I guess I'm too dumb to
understand.

As they're talking, a Cuban maid comes out of the house
carrying a tray with a glass of iced tea on it. She's in
her early twenties. Even in her sexless uniform she's a
striking woman. Her name is AURORA RUIZ.

GLORIA (CONT'D)

You think you'll be back in
time for dinner?

TOM

(distracted)
No.

Aurora sets the tray down, turns, and heads back into the
house. She moves with an easy sure-footed grace.

As she walks away, Tom watches her. His nostrils flare.
His eyes glaze.

Gloria notes this.

TOM (CONT'D)
Who's that?

GLORIA
Aurora.

TOM
She new?

GLORIA
Mm-hmm.

TOM

What happened to Maria?

Gloria picks up her drink, takes a sip, holds the cool
glass against her forehead.

GLORIA
She wasn't really doing her
job. I had to let her go.

TOM
What about this one -- the pay
the same?

GLORIA

(exhaling irritably)
Of course. I know what the
budget is.

She turns and walks toward the house.

She leans over the sink, rinses a plate, loads it into
the dishwasher.

TOM (0.S.)
You like it here?

She turns around, a little startled. After an awkward
pause, she gives him a small, polite smile.

AURORA
(with an accent)
Yes, sir.

TOM
Everything okay?

AURORA
(nodding)
Yes.

TOM
Mrs. Conovan -- you getting
along with her?

AURORA
(a little
uncomfortable)
Yes, of course.
TOM
(smiling)
Good.
(a beat)
You have a problem, you can
always come to me, okay?

AURORA
Yes, sir. Thank you.

He stands there for a moment, smiling, and then he turns
away.

She watches him as he goes.

Aurora is cutting flowers, placing them into a basket.
Gloria is standing nearby. She's wearing a large sun hat.

GLORIA
..-Have you decided?

AURORA
(nervous )
Ay, sefora.
(a beat)
This is hard for me.

GLORIA
Think about your family.
You'll have enough money to
bring them here from Cuba.

AURORA
(close to tears)
I know. But for me to do
this...

She trails off, snips a flower off with her clippers.

GLORIA
Look, you've seen how he
treats me. If you help me,
I'll be able to get a divorce,
and this house will be mine.
You'll have a place here with
me as long as you want.

Aurora is on the verge of great emotion now.
Gloria takes hold of her arms.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
(firmly)
Look at me.
Aurora slowly looks at her.
GLORIA (CONT'D)

Aurora nods.

AURORA

composure)
...-What if Mr. Conovan doesn't
want me?

GLORIA
(laughing sharply)
Have you seen the way he looks
at you?

Aurora flushes with shyness. She nods.
GLORIA (CONT'D)

Well, then, just remember --

the best way to chase

something is to let it chase

you.
INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - RECEPTION - LATE AFTERNOON 17
John comes in. He crosses the reception room, opens the
door to his office.

INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 18

JOHN
You shouldn't have come here.
We need to be careful.

She gets up and moves toward him. She puts her hands
around his neck and pulls his head toward hers, until
their mouths all but touch.

GLORIA
I'm always careful. Besides,
you're my attorney. We could
account for a couple of
visits, couldn't we?

JOHN
That's not the point.

GLORIA
Don't be angry...

She kisses him. He pulls back, gazes at her.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
What's that look?

I can't believe you're with
me.

You could have any man you

Aren't you?

lot of people get divorced.
I've been through it. And it's
never easy.

GLORIA
It's the only way to get
everything we want.

JOHN
Is it?

GLORIA

My husband thinks I should be
able to manage with what he
gives me, which is a generous
amount for a reasonable woman.

(smiling)
It just so happens that I'm
not a reasonable woman.

(a beat)
Besides, we're doing this for
us. I thought that's what you

wanted.
JOHN
It is.
GLORIA
Don't say it if you don't mean
it.

Neither would I.

Yes.

JOHN
..-But I know I could never
give you what he could.

Why would you say that?

JOHN
It's the truth. An honest
lawyer doesn't make much.

GLORIA
(smiling)
You're not that honest.

JOHN
(a quality of fate in
his voice)
Well, whatever I've got, it's
yours. Whatever you need, I'1l
get.

GLORIA
That's what I love about you.
But you don't need to worry,
because we're going to have
plenty.

JOHN
I just don't want anything to
go wrong.

Nothing's going to go wrong.
We're close now. We just need
to follow things through.

That'd be a good place to

Yes.

Yes, she's going to lead my

going to have the photos to
prove it. Yes, he'll be forced
to pay me. Yes, yes, yes...

They kiss.
JOHN
...When's it gonna happen?
GLORIA
I don't know.
JOHN
Soon?
GLORIA
We need to wait for the right
moment.
JOHN

So what's the plan?

GLORIA
Well, I was thinking...after
he and I have an argument, I
could go out somewhere for a
while, leave him alone in the
house with her...

Gloria is on the phone.

GLORIA
(into phone)
Where are you?

EXT. PAYPHONE - LATE AFTERNOON 20

Beaumont's car is parked next to an open-air phone. The
racetrack is visible in the background. He's on the
phone, disheveled and bleary-eyed, still dressed in his
grimy, unpressed suit. His scruffy tie is crooked.

INTERCUT BETWEEN GLORIA AND BEAUMONT.

BEAUMONT
(into phone)
I've been at the track.
Figured I'd come and watch the
dogs a while.

GLORIA
(sarcastic)
Sounds exciting.

BEAUMONT
Well, it's like I told you --
the rabbit always wins.

He takes out a small package of sunflower seeds. A few
pigeons waddle by. He tosses them a handful of seeds.

GLORIA
(becoming impatient)
Right. So do you have
anything?

BEAUMONT
Not yet. He's been a good boy.
If you want, I'll keep
following him, but it's gonna
get expensive.

GLORIA
Well, look, I'm not that
concerned about days. Just
stay on him a few more nights.

BEAUMONT
All right.

He hangs up the phone, looks around. He tosses the
pigeons some more seeds. They peck away at the ground.

21 INT. CONOVAN HOUSE - NIGHT 21

Tom and Gloria sit at opposite ends of the dining room
table, which is set with fine china and crystal. They're
finishing dinner. She pushes her food around on her
plate.

TOM
Not hungry?

GLORIA
I've had enough.

TOM

smile)

TOM (CONT'D)
Guess you're at that age where
you need to start watching
what you eat.

She rests her tanned arms on the table, gives him a
jaundiced look.

GLORIA
Have you decided if you're
coming to the gallery opening?

He slices off a piece of rare sirloin, raises the fork to
his mouth, chews.

TOM
No, you go. Just don't buy
anything.

GLORIA

Don't worry. With what you
give me, I couldn't afford to.

He shakes his head.

TOM

(laughing irritably)
It must be rough on you,
living in this house,
wondering which dress you're
gonna wear and which car
you're gonna drive. You didn't
have those problems when I met
you. Who knows -- if we hadn't
met, you might still be
working as a stewardess.

She fingers the stem of her wine glass, inspecting a
crescent her lips have left on the rim.

GLORIA
I'm not complaining.

TOM
‘Course not. You know better
than to do that.

She tucks her hair behind her ears. Her bejewelled
earlobes glitter.

TOM (CONT'D)
Nice earrings.

GLORIA
(without looking at
him)
Thank you.
He picks up a piece of French bread, runs it through the

juice on his plate, puts it in his mouth, washes it down
with some red wine.

TOM
I don't remember buying those
for you.

GLORIA

I bought them for myself.

He grimaces, showing his teeth. There's a sudden
intensity in his eyes. A hint of menace.

TOM
They expensive?

She looks up slowly. There's a scornful expression around
her mouth.

GLORIA
(an edge to her
voice)
Why -- are you going to deduct
them from my allowance?

He stares at her for a moment, then slices off another
piece of steak and chews it.

TOM
I just wanna know where my
money's going.

GLORIA
Well, it is only money, Tom.

TOM
(glowering)
Yeah. Mine.

He rises, walks away from the table.

22 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 22
Tom heads for the door. Gloria follows him.

GLORIA
Where are you going?

TOM
(terse)
Out.

GLORIA
Where?

TOM
Why, you gonna miss me?

He walks out.

She blinks, stands there, stares at the door.

23 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 23
Tom is tooling around in his convertible.
There's a bus stop ahead. As Tom gets closer to it, he
sees Aurora sitting on the bench. She's wearing a nice,
simple dress.

Tom slows down and pulls over to the curb.

TOM
Hey, where you headed?

AURORA
I was going to get something
to eat.

TOM
You want some company?

AURORA
Oh, no, that's okay.

He leans over, opens the passenger side door.

TOM
Come on, I'll take you

Reluctantly, she gets into the car and closes the door.

TOM (CONT'D)
Fasten your seat belt.

AURORA
What?

He tugs on his seat belt.

AURORA (CONT'D)
(a little
embarrassed)
Oh, yes.

He watches, amused, as she struggles with the belt.

TOM
You look nice.

AURORA
Thank you, sir.

TOM
You don't have to call me
that. Call me Tom.

AURORA
(diffidently)
I can't do that.

TOM
(mock serious)
Who's the boss?

AURORA
(laughing)
You, sir.
TOM
(smiling)
Okay, then. Call me Tom.

He drops the car into gear, and they pull away.

INT. BAR - NIGHT 24
Tom and Aurora are sitting at a table, sipping drinks.

TOM
(looking around)
I like this place.

AURORA
(smiling)
Me too.

TOM
How do you say "me too" in
Spanish?

AURORA
Yo tambien.

TOM
(mangling it)
Yo tambien.

She laughs.

TOM (CONT'D)
(chuckling)
That bad, huh?

AURORA
(touching his arm)
No, no, I should not laugh.
I'm sorry.

TOM
(amused)
Don't be.

She leans forward to sip her drink, revealing a bit more
of what he can't help but notice.

TOM (CONT'D)
So, you have a boyfriend?

Tom laughs.

INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT

Tom and Aurora are parked outside the bar. He leans

toward her. Being this close

The scent of her. The allure.

He moves in for a kiss.

He works his lips together as if tasting something he
likes. He moves in again. She moves back again. She's
running out of room.
TOM
Tell me what you want.
Anything.
AURORA
Please...
(a beat)
Just take me home.

TOM
I won't hurt you. I promise.

AURORA
And tomorrow...?

He gives her a wet smile.
TOM
Don't worry, sweetheart. You
know the old song? Mafiana
never comes.

25A EXT. MOTEL 25A

A cheap motel with a neon sign.

26 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 26
Shabby, anonymous furniture.

Tom is in the bathroom. The door is half-closed. A narrow
shaft of light slices out across the floor.

Aurora sits in a chair in the corner. She seems nervous,
scared.

Glancing around, she notices the heavy curtains blocking
the window.

She gets up, goes to the window, parts the curtains.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 27
Tom splashes a handful of water on his face. He grabs a

towel, dries his face off. He looks at his reflection in
the mirror.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 28
The bathroom door opens. Tom comes out. It's time.
Aurora turns around.

He moves toward her. He looks into her eyes, smooths her
hair back.

TOM
(almost tenderly)
It's okay.

He takes her by the wrist, leads her to the bed, sits on
the edge of it. She stands there as he admires the full
swell of her breasts. She seems embarrassed. He cups her
breasts in his hands and looks up at her.

TOM (CONT'D)
Is this all right...?

AURORA
(quietly)
Yes.

TOM
Let's see what's underneath
this...

He reaches for the top button of her dress, unfastens it,
and pauses. Then he unfastens the next button. He can see
her bra now. Next button.

TOM (CONT'D)
(smiling)
Could you...?

She looks at him for a moment, then unfastens her dress
so that it hangs loose on her shoulders.

He reaches up and slips the dress down, just a bit, his
eyes fixed on the tops of her breasts.

She shrugs out of the dress and lets him pull it all the

way down, until it's at her feet. She is wearing a modest
white bra and panty set.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
36

He is mesmerized. Her figure is even more voluptuous than
he had imagined.

He puts his hands on her waist, kisses her stomach. His
hands move over her skin.

She's starting to realize how much power she has over
him, but she isn't sure how to use it, or even how much
she wants it. She's not immune to what he's doing to her,
though. She likes it.

She's standing with her back to us now. She reaches back
and unclasps her bra, and the only thing that's keeping
it in place is his grip on her breasts.

He lifts his hands, and the bra slips off. He grips his
arms around her back and pulls her down onto the bed.

INT. BEAUMONT'S CAR - NIGHT 29

Beaumont is parked outside the motel, clutching a camera
with a long telephoto lens. He trains the camera at the
motel window and clicks off a few quick shots. He lets
out a yawn.

INT. CONOVAN HOUSE - NIGHT 30
The phone rings. Gloria answers it.
GLORIA
(into phone)
Hello.
BEAUMONT (0.S.)

Mrs. Conovan?

GLORIA
Yes.

BEAUMONT (0.S.)
Yes ma'am. I believe you owe
me some money.

There's a click on the other end.

37

She hangs up, sits there for a moment. Then she picks up

the phone and hits the speed dial.

INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

31

The room is dark. John lies in bed, face down, sprawled

out. The phone on the nightstand rings. He turns on a
light, opens one eye, looks at the phone, answers it.

INTERCUT BETWEEN GLORIA AND JOHN.

JOHN
(into phone)
Hello?

GLORIA
Hi. It's me.

JOHN

(sleepy)
Hey.

GLORIA
I just got a call...

JOHN
Uh-huh.

GLORIA
I'll have the pictures
tomorrow.

I hope they're good.

JOHN
Don't worry. They'll be good

JOHN
I know. We'll be together
soon.
GLORIA
Okay.
(sweetly)

Go back to sleep.

She hangs up the phone. A smile flashes across her face.

EXT. CONOVAN HOUSE - MORNING 32

A beautiful morning. A blue sky fleeced with perfectly
white clouds.

Gloria, wrapped in a thick terry cloth robe, sits at the
table by the pool. She sips a glass of orange juice.

Tom comes out of the house. He's wearing suit pants
without the jacket. He picks up his juice, takes a long
swallow.

GLORIA
You were out late last night.

TOM
(nonchalant)
Ran into a friend.
GLORIA
Did you?
(a beat)
A male friend, or a female
one?

TOM
It was Stan Carlisle.

Aurora comes out, carrying a serving tray.
Gloria looks at her.
Tom doesn't see her, because she's behind him.

GLORIA
So how is he?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
39

TOM
He's fine. Said to say hello.

GLORIA
Really. How nice.

Aurora sets the tray down. There's a large covered plate
with Tom's breakfast, a smaller one with his bagel, a
platter with some cream cheese on it, a fork, a large
knife, a smaller knife to spread the cream cheese.

Gloria seems to be enjoying the awkward tension between
Tom and Aurora. She watches as they ignore each other.

Aurora uncovers the larger plate.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
Looks good.

TOM
(gruff)
Yeah.

Aurora turns and heads back into the house.
Tom throws his tie over his shoulder, starts eating.

Neither one speaks for a moment. The only sounds are the
tiny clicks of Tom's knife and fork against his plate.

GLORIA
Something bothering you?

TOM
Why?

GLORIA
You're not acting like
yourself.

TOM
Really? How'm I acting?

GLORIA
I don't know...

Tell me, what was Stan
wearing?

TOM
(irritably)
What?

GLORIA
Last night, when you ran into
him.
(a beat)
A suit? Pants and a sport jacket?
(a beat)
A low cut dress?

He jabs a piece of egg, skewers a bit of ham, sips his
last swallow of juice, dabs his mouth with a napkin.

TOM
(caught off guard)
What're you talking about?

GLORIA
I think you have an idea.

TOM
(muttering)
Christ...
(a long sighing
exhalation)
I don't need this. Not this
morning.

He rises, walks away.
Gloria watches him go.
GLORIA
(smiling)
Have a nice day, sweetheart.

EXT. MOTEL - DAY 34
The same cheap motel. An exterior hall balcony on each
floor has the entrance doors to the rooms. Beaumont's car
turns into the parking lot.

INT. MOTEL OFFICE - DAY 35
The clerk looks up as Beaumont enters.

CLERK
Can I help you?

BEAUMONT
I've got a reservation. It's
under Tom Conovan.

The clerk goes over his reservation list. It's short.

CLERK
Conovan, yeah, here it is. You
him?

BEAUMONT

No, he'll be here later.

Beaumont hands the clerk a credit card. The clerk checks
the number against what's on his reservation list.

CLERK
This is for you.

He hands Beaumont a registration form. Beaumont checks
the form to make sure that "Tom Conovan" is listed as the
room's primary occupant.

BEAUMONT
Room 110 available?

The clerk goes over his reservation list again.

CLERK (CONT'D)
Yeah. Here ya go. 110.

The clerk hands Beaumont a key with a large plastic tag.

CLERK (CONT'D)
Just turn left when you walk

out.
BEAUMONT
Thanks.
36 INT. CONOVAN HOUSE - DAY 36

Gloria is talking with Aurora in the master bedroom.

Aurora is clearly feeling mixed emotions about what she's
done.

GLORIA
It's over now. You don't have
to do anything else.

AURORA
Now you divorce him?

GLORIA
Uh-huh. And then we can start
to work on bringing your
family here.

AURORA
(moved)
Oh, sefiora. This means
everything to me.

GLORIA
I know it does.

She puts an arm around Gloria, leads her to the bedroom
door.

AURORA
...Thank you.

GLORIA
(smiling)
No. Thank you.
37 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 37

Beaumont is stretched out on the bed, the phone pressed
to his ear. He dials. After a moment:

BEAUMONT
(into phone)
Hi, uh -- you're not by any

chance the same desk clerk who
was on duty this afternoon?
(listens)
No, I didn't think so.
(listens)
Well, the thing is, I was here
last night, in the same room,
but I lost my statement. I was
wondering if I could get
another copy of it.
(listens)
Tom Conovan. C-O-N-O-V-A-N.
(listens)
If you could just slide it
under my door, that'd be
great.

38 INT. DARKROOM - DAY 38

Darkness. We hear the click of a pull-string. A red light
bulb is illuminated.

We're in a makeshift darkroom. It's crowded with metal
developing pans, bottles of chemicals, packages of photo
paper, developer bath, stop bath, fixing bath.

Beaumont slides a piece of photo paper into the developer
bath.

The paper sinks in the solution until it's submerged.

Sweat rolls into his eyes. He wipes his forehead with a
sleeve. Then, gently, he lifts a corner of the pan up and
down so that the solution flows back and forth over the
paper. Delicate work.

By degrees, pale and indistinct forms appear on the
paper.

He examines them.

A high-contrast black-and-white image materializes. It's
Tom and Aurora, in the motel room.

He smiles.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING 39
A darkening sky. Incandescent light from within the
coffee shop.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING 40
Gloria is seated in a vinyl booth.

Beaumont comes in, looks around, sees her. He approaches
and slides into the booth.

BEAUMONT
(genial)
Greetings and salutations.
He places a manila envelope on the table between them.
She unfastens the clasp, bends back the flap, reaches
into the envelope and pulls out an 8 x 10 black-and-white
photo.

It's grainy, but the faces are unmistakably those of Tom
and Aurora. They're standing in the motel room.

Gloria stares down at the photo, a smooth untroubled look
on her face.

Beaumont fans himself with his hat.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
45

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
You seem to be taking this a
lot better than I thought you
would.

She glances at him coolly, then takes a few more photos
out of the envelope and looks at them. They are
progressively more compromising.

One of them shows Tom and Aurora on the bed, without
their clothes.

Gloria's untroubled look turns abruptly hard.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
That's one of my favorites.
Didn't have a hell of a lot of
light to work with, but
there's no doubt about what
those two are doing.

She puts the photos down on the table and pushes them
into a stack with her finger.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
There's a copy of your
husband's bill for the room in
there, too.

She slides a thick pay envelope across the table.

He picks it up and turns it over in his plump hands. He
opens it. There's a packet of stiff new bills inside.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
Genuine coin a' the realm.

He takes the bills out, counts them, taps their edges
into alignment. He stuffs them back into the envelope and
tucks the flap in over them.

GLORIA
All fifties, as requested.

BEAUMONT
I appreciate that. Anything
larger creates problems. And I
don't like having problems.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary

GLORIA
You like having money, though.

BEAUMONT

.--I like having peace of
mind. Which is not the same
thing.

(a beat)
It's like the man said.
Money's round. It rolls toward
you, and it rolls away.

She picks up the photos and slips them into the manila
envelope.

GLORIA
Does anyone besides John know
I hired you?

BEAUMONT
Not a soul.

GLORIA
Good. If my husband ever found
out about this, I'm afraid it
would be over between us.

BEAUMONT
(smiling bleakly)
Well, I'm not a marriage
counselor, but offhand I'd say
it's already over between you.

As he slides out of the booth, he hacks out a chuckle.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
Look at it this way -- half of
all marriages end in divorce.
Which is not as bad as it
sounds, when you consider the
other half end in death.

GLORIA
..-You're an interesting man.

BEAUMONT

(putting on his hat)
It's just an act.

doorbell. We hear distant chimes.

GLORIA (0.S.)
(through the
intercom)
Yes?

TOM
(into intercom)
My key's not working.

GLORIA (0.S.)
I had the locks changed this
morning.

TOM

What's going on?

GLORIA (0.S.)
You don't live here anymore.

TOM
Let me in.

There is no response.
TOM (CONT'D)
Come on...

We can discuss this.
GLORIA (0.S.)
You can discuss it with my
attorney.
He pounds on the door.

Open the goddamn door!

He pounds on the door again, then steps back and stares
at it. He blinks with vacant eyes.

All right. I'll be there soon.

43 EXT. CONOVAN HOUSE - AFTERNOON 43

steps away from the door, and John enters the house.
44 INT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON 44
Gloria leads John through the house toward the pool.
JOHN

(looking around)
Aurora here?

GLORIA
I sent her out to run some
errands.

JOHN

Where's your husband?
GLORIA
When he came home this
afternoon I told him I'd had
the locks changed. He's
already gone.
45 EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - AFTERNOON 45

John and Gloria come out of the house.

She stretches herself out on a chaise lounge.
He shucks off his suit jacket, sits in a deck chair.

JOHN
Any idea where he might spend
the night?

She turns her face toward the sun.

GLORIA
Does it matter?

JOHN
I think we should serve him
with the papers as soon as
possible.

GLORIA
He'll probably sleep on his
boat.

JOHN
You don't think he'd check
into a hotel?

GLORIA
That's the interesting thing
about Tom -- he's got more

money than he knows what to do

with, but he'd rather die than

spend any of it.
EXT. MARINA - LATE AFTERNOON 46
Tom is unloading gear and supplies from the trunk of his
car. A sleek ocean-going yacht is tied up at the dock
behind him.

A car wheels into the parking lot. A man gets out. He
walks up to Tom.

MAN
Tom Conovan?

Tom looks up.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
47

50

TOM
Yeah.

The man flourishes a sheaf of typewritten pages.

MAN
These are for you.

The man unceremoniously hands over the documents, then
walks away.

Tom looks at the papers.

The top page reads: IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 11TH
CIRCUIT IN AND FOR DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA. FAMILY DIVISION.
IN RE: THE DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE. "Petitioner: Wife."

Tom's jaw sags.

INT. LAW FIRM - DAY 47
A well-appointed conference room.

John and Gloria are seated at a long table. John's nerves
are clearly on edge. Gloria, looking cool in a fitted
skirt suit, is preternaturally calm.

Across the table, Tom is seated next to his attorney, SAM
MASTERSON. He's a heavy man in his late fifties, sharply
dressed in a custom suit.

Tom flips through the photos of him and Aurora. His face
is grim. He passes the photos to Masterson.

Masterson glances at a couple of them, lays them on the
table.

MASTERSON
At this point my client is
willing to consider
reconciliation.

JOHN
We've ruled that out.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
51

MASTERSON
Then I'd like to propose a
thirty day cooling off period
before initiating any
proceedings.

JOHN
My client has made a decision.
She doesn't need any more
time.

MASTERSON
(nodding equably)
All right. If you've got a
proposal, let's hear it.

JOHN
Monthly alimony payments in
the amount of twenty thousand
dollars, plus sole possession
of the house and fifty percent
of all cash and liquid assets.

MASTERSON
(smiling tightly)
Let's be reasonable.

JOHN
That is reasonable. Your
client signed a prenuptial
agreement. I believe you drew
it up for him, so I'm sure
you're familiar with its
provisions. And I'm sure you
realize that a court is going
to rule in our favor.

MASTERSON
Well, I'm not as sure you are.

JOHN
Your client plainly violated
the agreement's fidelity
clause.

Gloria gives Tom a hurt, reproachful look. It seems
perfectly sincere.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
52

MASTERSON
I think that's for a court to
decide.

John looks squarely at Masterson.

JOHN
Look, I have a witness who can
testify that your client
checked into a motel with
another woman, I have a copy
of his statement for the room,
and I have photos of
everything.

The color has drained from Masterson's face. He
compresses his lips into a narrow seam.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Now: you can allow your client
to be humiliated in a very
public way, or we can avoid
all of that and agree on a
settlement. It's up to you.

TOM
Gloria, for God's sake. Can't
we talk about this?

JOHN
My client is not here to
answer questions. You have her
terms.

MASTERSON
Her terms are outrageous.

JOHN
..-All right, then. If there's
nothing else, I think we're
finished.

He points to the photos.
JOHN (CONT'D)
You can keep those, and the

receipt from the motel. We
have copies.

JOHN (CONT'D)
(to Gloria)
Shall we?

John and Gloria stand.
JOHN (CONT'D)
(to Tom and his
attorney)
Gentlemen.
He opens the door, holds it for Gloria, follows her out.
Tom sits there and watches them go. He is white with
anger.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 48
John and Gloria step into an elevator. John presses a
button. The doors close.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 49
John and Gloria are alone in the elevator. They look at
each other for a moment. She moves closer to him, then
kisses him deeply and pins him against the wall. She
reaches bluntly between his legs.
GLORIA
Is this for me?
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 50
John and Gloria step outside, keeping a respectable
distance from each other, casually smoothing their
clothes. They head across the parking lot toward their
cars.
He is smiling.

Her face is flushed with excitement. Her eyes are
brilliant.

They walk in silence for a moment. When they do speak,
they don't look at each other.

GLORIA
I want you more right now than
I ever have.
JOHN
(grinning)
Really.
They come to her car.
He turns, offers his handshake.
She takes his hand, shakes it for show.
GLORIA
Will you follow me back to the
house?
He nods.

She gets into the car.

He looks around, then heads toward his own car.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 51
Beaumont stands behind a pillar. He's been watching John
and Gloria. He takes a small pad out of his hip pocket,
makes a note. He smiles.

INT. CONOVAN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 52
John follows Gloria into the living room.

GLORIA
We did it.

JOHN
It's not completely done.

GLORIA
He can't contest anything.

JOHN
It still has to be presented
to the court for written
approval. The judge has to
sign off on it.

GLORIA
I thought you were excited.

A smile doesn't entirely hide his wariness.

JOHN
I am.

GLORIA
Then don't worry so much.

She heads to the bar. She picks up a tumbler, fills it
with ice, splashes some bourbon into it, hands it to him.
She fixes one for herself, holds it up to the light. She
taps her glass against his.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
To us.

They drink. She cracks an ice cube between her teeth. She
sits on the sofa, sinks back onto it, crosses her legs.
Her drink dangles from her hand. She swings her upper leg
gently.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
(with a sexy pout)
So...what we should we do now?
JOHN
(smiling)
I don't know.

He moves toward her. He sets his glass down and lightly
strokes her cheek.

She sets her glass down, holding his gaze.
He bends down and kisses her.

She pulls him to her tightly, moving her hands over his
body.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING 53

John stirs and wakes up. He's alone in the bed. He scrubs
at his eyes with his knuckles, looks around.

The bathroom door is open and the shower is running.

He swings his feet to the floor, sits on the edge of the
bed, hunches forward. He notices a framed photo on the
nightstand.

The photo shows Tom and Gloria standing on a sunstruck
beach. Tom's wearing a long beach robe, and Gloria is in
a swimsuit.

John traces his finger down Gloria's leg. Then his eyes
shift over to Tom, whose head is thrown back slightly.

Tom is laughing.

GLORIA (0.S.)
I've been meaning to do
something about that.

John turns his head.

Gloria, fresh out of the shower, is framed in the doorway
of the bathroom. She has a plush bath sheet wrapped
tightly around her shapely figure.

She moves past him, plucks the photo off the nightstand,
tosses it into a drawer. She sits down next to him on the
bed.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
...-We don't have to hide from
anyone now.

He rubs the back of his neck.

She moves behind him on the bed, starts lightly massaging
his neck and shoulders. She speaks softly into his ear:

GLORIA (CONT'D)
We can finally be together.
Take care of each other.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
And with the money we've got,
you won't have any problem
making those alimony payments.

JOHN
(laughing)
My ex-wife'll be thrilled.

GLORIA
I'm sure she will be. But none
of that matters, does it? No
one else really matters now.
It's just us.

JOHN
When are you going to pay
Aurora?

GLORIA
When the divorce is finalized.
(a beat)
And then I'm going to fire
her.

JOHN
What?

GLORIA
You saw the pictures. You've
seen her body. You don't think
I want that body walking
around in front of you every
day, do you?

He lies down on the bed. She lies down next to him.

JOHN
It's good to know that you
trust me so much.

GLORIA
Sorry...

It's been a long time since I
was in a loving relationship.

JOHN
You've been married for ten
years.

GLORIA

(laughing mournfully)
That's what I mean.

JOHN
You don't consider that a
relationship?

GLORIA
I don't know. It never really
felt like he was my husband.
(a beat)
It felt more like...an
arrangement.

JOHN
An "arrangement"?

GLORIA
Yeah. It was like we had a
deal. He actually used those
words. "Let's make a deal."

JOHN
...What was the deal?

GLORIA
My looks. His money.

JOHN
..-That's romantic.

GLORIA
Well, I knew what I had to
offer him, and he knew what he
had to offer me.

EXT. MARINA - DAY 54

A couple of seagulls wheel around lazily over the water.

Tom's car pulls up. He gets out. He's wearing a T-shirt,

a pair of shorts, deck shoes. He has a few days of beard

on his face. He walks out onto the dock, pauses to admire
his boat.

BEAUMONT (0.S.)
She's a beauty.

Tom starts, turns, looks around. Beaumont is standing in
the parking lot. He pushes his hat back on his head,
gestures toward the boat.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
You take her out much?

TOM
Who are you?

BEAUMONT
(smiling inscrutably)
I'm the man's gonna haul your
ass out of the fire.

55 EXT. BOAT - DAY 55
Tom and Beaumont sit at the stern, each with a beer.

BEAUMONT

(dry, matter-of-fact)
I've done a lot of work for
John, but when he called me
about your wife, I knew there
was something strange about
it. The way he talked about
her. It got my attention. I
decided to do some freelance
work, started tailing him. Saw
him meet up with your wife in
a parking lot. Followed them
to a motel, got some nice
pictures of them together.

(a beat)
All of this went down before I
took the pictures of you.

Tom sits there, waiting for more. Finally:

TOM
How much?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
60

BEAUMONT
(chuckling)
You get right to it, don't
you?

TOM
How much?

BEAUMONT
(sipping his drink)
Well, I'd say that depends on
how much you want what I have.

TOM
What -- some pictures?

BEAUMONT
No, no, no. These are not
“some pictures." These are the
pictures that are going to
nullify the infidelity charge
your wife is using to take
away a whole lot of your
money. From what I've heard,
she's doing quite a number on
you. Quite a set-up.

TOM
(watchful)
What do you mean, "set-up"?
BEAUMONT
The girl -- Aurora? I went to

the agency she works out of.
Your wife had a cattle call at
your house before she picked
her. Seems she was looking for
a very specific type of girl.
(smiling)
The type you'd find
irresistible.

TOM
(staggered)
.+-The girl was in on it?

BEAUMONT

You were there. You tell me.
Did she come on to you, ever?

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary

TOM
(nonplussed)
..-No.
BEAUMONT

And that night?

TOM
She was waiting for a bus. We
wound up going to a bar...
(a beat)
How'd you know where we were?

BEAUMONT
It's my job to know these
things.

TOM

(thinking out loud)
I wonder how much Gloria's
paying her.

BEAUMONT
Not enough, considering.

TOM
Would you be willing to give a
deposition?

BEAUMONT
(getting up to leave)
Absolutely. No extra charge.

TOM
All right. I'll call my
lawyer, see if I can get an
extension on the hearing.
(draining his glass)
You bring me the pictures,
we'll talk about money.

56 EXT. ROAD - DAY 56

Tom's car is parked next to Beaumont's.

INT. BEAUMONT'S CAR - DAY 57

Beaumont sits quietly in the driver's seat as Tom pores
over a series of 8 x 10 black-and-white photos.

The photos, taken through a telephoto lens, show John and
Gloria in bed.

Tom slowly flips through the photos. He turns and gazes
out the window.

TOM

(bemused)
You know, a month after we
met, she said we should get
married. I said, Don't you
want to get to know me a
little more? She said, Why,
does it get better?

(laughing bitterly)
My family never liked her. We
had a small wedding. Flew down
to Santo Domingo, hired a
local band, got married on the
beach. She said she didn't
want a thing in the world
except to be with me...

Beaumont pats his pockets, takes out a roll of antacid
tablets. He pops a couple into his mouth and chews them.
He grimaces.

BEAUMONT

I'll tell you the way I look

at it, the ones who say they

don't want anything always get

more in the end.
Tom carefully slides the photos into a manila envelope.
Beaumont rubs his nose with the back of his hand.
Tom hands Beaumont a fat pay envelope.

Beaumont opens the envelope with his thick fingers,
counts the money inside.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
.--I've been thinking...
(a beat)
I'm not sure how much good
those pictures are gonna do
you.

TOM
What?

BEAUMONT
...They prove she was having
an affair with her lawyer. But
they don't prove she set you

up.

TOM
What're you suggesting?

BEAUMONT
I'm suggesting you'd be on
firmer ground if you had
another piece of evidence.

TOM
Like what?
BEAUMONT
Like, say, a taped confession.
TOM
(laughing)
And how do you propose I get
that?
BEAUMONT
There're ways.
TOM
(skeptical)
Really.
BEAUMONT
Uh-huh.
TOM

Such as...?

BEAUMONT
The less you know about it the
better.
Tom considers this for a moment.

TOM
When could I have it by?

BEAUMONT
Few days. Sooner, maybe.

TOM
...All right...

He gets out of the car.

INT. JOHN'S OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 58

Beaumont heads down the hall to John's office carrying a
tool kit. He moves quietly, looking relaxed.

He kneels in front of the door. He opens the tool kit and
starts using lock-picking tools on the lock.
INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 59
Beaumont enters, closes the door, locks it.

He takes out a penlight and turns it on. He flashes it
around the office, finds the phone.

He goes over to the phone, picks it up, unscrews the
earpiece.

He takes a small, round listening device out of his
pocket. He peels off the backing to expose the adhesive.

He attaches the listening device inside the phone, puts
the phone back together.

He heads for the door.

EXT. PAYPHONE - AFTERNOON 60

Behind John's office. Beaumont's car is parked nearby.

Beaumont is dialing a number. He waits, clears his
throat.

INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON 61

The phone starts ringing in the reception room. Susan
picks it up, then hits the hold button.

SUSAN
(yells) )
John. It's for you. He
wouldn't give his name.
(a beat)
You want him?

JOHN
Sure.

John swivels in his chair so that he can see Susan in the
reception room.

As she hangs up her phone, she gives him a strange,
ambivalent look.

He watches her as she goes back to work.
INTERCUT BETWEEN BEAUMONT AND JOHN.
JOHN (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Hello?
BEAUMONT

Hiya John.

JOHN
Hey...

BEAUMONT
...When you and your

her husband, whose idea was it
to bring in the maid?

JOHN
What?

Beaumont hangs up.

INT. BEAUMONT'S CAR - AFTERNOON 62

The driver's side door opens and Beaumont gets in. He
puts on a pair of headphones.

The headphones are connected to a radio surveillance
receiver. The receiver is hooked up to a tape recorder.

We hear the phone ringing in the headphones.

BEAUMONT
Come on...

GLORIA (0.S.)
(through headphones )
..-Hello?

JOHN (0.S.)
(through headphones )
It's me...

GLORIA (0.S.)
What's wrong?

JOHN (0.S.)
I just got a call. I think
Beaumont knows something.

GLORIA (0.S.)
About what...?

JOHN (0.S.)
You, me, Aurora. He knows
about the whole thing...

GLORIA (0.S.)
I don't see how he could.

JOHN (0.S.)
I'm telling you, he does.

GLORIA (0.S.)
(chafing)

Well, what do you expect me to

do?

JOHN (0.S.)
-+-I don't know.

GLORIA (0.S.)
Look, you're a lawyer. He
can't do anything unless he
has some evidence, right?

JOHN (0.S.)
Right...

GLORIA (0.S.)
So, then, don't worry about
it.

(a beat)
.--I can't really talk now.
I'll call you later, okay?

JOHN (0.S.)
(still distraught)
Okay.
We hear a click on the line.

Beaumont takes off the headphones, sits back, smiles.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 63
An empty parking lot.

Tom's car turns in. As the car's headlights sweep across
the lot, they briefly throw light on Beaumont's car,
which idles unobtrusively in the darkness.

Tom parks, gets out.
Beaumont rolls his window down.

BEAUMONT
‘Evening, Tom.

INT. BEAUMONT'S CAR - NIGHT 64

Tom settles himself into the passenger seat. He glances
at Beaumont, who's rumpled and sweating.

BEAUMONT
You know, a lot of people come
here at night. You'd be
surprised.

Beaumont takes out a handkerchief and wipes the sweat
from the palms of his hands.

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)

(getting expansive)
Sometimes I'll see two cars
pull in and park next to each
other. The drivers'1ll go off
somewhere in one of the cars.
I jot down the license plate
numbers and look ‘em up the
next day. If their listings
don't match, there's a chance
they're married to other
people. And if they are, I'll
place a call to the spouses.
I've found a few clients that
way.

He mops his brow.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary

BEAUMONT (CONT'D)
...-The things people think
they can get away with.

TOM
You ever been married?

BEAUMONT
No. Can't say I have.

Tom turns and peers out the window.

TOM
It does strange things to
people.

BEAUMONT

Well, despite my line of work,
I've seen a few happily
married couples.

Tom shrugs.

TOM
Marriage has got nothing to do
with happiness.

Beaumont laughs at this. His amusement is genuine and
unalloyed.

BEAUMONT
I'd say you've got a
particular slant on the
subject.

Tom is silent for a moment.

TOM
(unsmiling)
Yeah, I do.
(a beat)
You have something for me?

Beaumont dips into his jacket pocket with two fingers,
pulls out a tape. He hands it Tom.

BEAUMONT

..-And I believe you have
something for me...

Tom slips the tape into his pocket, then hands Beaumont a
thick pay envelope.

Beaumont tucks the envelope into his jacket.

TOM
You're not gonna count it?

BEAUMONT
(smiling)
Nah, I trust ya.

Tom pulls a roll of bills out of his pocket. He peels off
a twenty, hands it to Beaumont.

TOM
Here. Get your car washed.

He gets out of the car.

INT. MASTERSON'S OFFICE - DAY 65
A large, richly decorated office.

Tom sits across from Masterson. He has just slapped the
tape on the desktop, next to the photos of John and
Gloria.

MASTERSON
And he's willing to testify
that he took these before he
took the ones of you and the
girl?

TOM
Yeah.

MASTERSON
You ever hear the term,
"connivance?"

Tom shakes his head.

MASTERSON (CONT'D)
Well, essentially, it's when
someone sets up a situation so
tempting that someone else
will commit a wrongdoing in
the pursuit of that
temptation. I've seen the
pictures. This girl definitely
falls into that category.

TOM
Which means...?

Masterson leans back in his chair.

MASTERSON
Which means your wife is in
for a very rude awakening.

TOM
What about the tape. Is it
admissable in court?

MASTERSON

(with a dismissive

wave)
It doesn't matter. I could go
out and get some corroborating
witnesses if I had to.

(smiling)
But I don't think I'll have
to.

TOM
(skeptical)
Why not?

MASTERSON
Believe me, once her lawyer
friend hears this tape, he's
not gonna want to go to court.

TOM
(thinking)
».--Can you get me a court
order so I can get into the
house, pick up some of my
stuff?

John stubs his cigarette out in an ashtray and stands up.

JOHN
(tense)
Hey.

GLORIA
Hi.

He comes out from behind the desk and moves toward her.
She locks her arms around his neck, looks up into his
eyes.

GLORIA (CONT'D)
Have you got any more of those
cigarettes?
JOHN
(restive)
Yeah.

He shakes a cigarette out of the pack and hands it to
her.

She fits it between her lips.
He lights it for her.
She takes a long slow drag and exhales.
He starts pacing up and down.
JOHN (CONT'D)
What if he really knows
something?
Gloria rotates her cigarette, looking at the ash.
GLORIA

If he knew anything, he'd have
done something by now.

JOHN

What if he goes to Tom?
GLORIA

With what? He doesn't have

anything.

JOHN
We don't know that.

GLORIA
He's done work for you in the
past, hasn't he?

JOHN
Uh-huh.

GLORIA
And has he ever given you a
reason not to trust him?
JOHN
With a guy like that, you
don't need a reason.

She screws her cigarette out in the ashtray and moves
toward him.

She straightens his tie, smooths his shirt to his chest.
She looks into his eyes.
GLORIA
(soothing)
Don't worry. Everything's
fine.
She kisses him on the lips, then pulls away.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
(smiling)
...-Meet me at the house in an
hour.

She turns and goes out the door.

INT. CONOVAN HOUSE - DAY 68

on the bed. A stylish one-suiter. He's hastily packing
some clothes.

The phone starts ringing.

He looks at it. He decides to let the answering machine
pick up. After a beep:

JOHN (0.S.)

(on the machine)
Hi, it's John. I just got a
call from Tom's attorney. They
got a thirty day extension.
We're gonna have to figure
something out. I'm on my way
over now. I'll see you soon.

Tom stands there, looking at the blinking message light
on the answering machine.

He lays some folded shirts into the suitcase.
Aurora comes in. She stands there.
He turns around.

AURORA
(in a small, parched
voice)
I just want you to know, I --

TOM
(shortly)
-- How much is she paying you?

AURORA
What?

TOM
My wife. How much is she
paying you, to do what you
did?

AURORA
(contrite)
Ten thousand dollars. And she
promised to help bring my
family here. She said they can
live here, with her.

He studies her for a moment, moves toward her.

She lowers her head. Tears well up in her eyes.
He gently raises her chin.
TOM

It's okay.

She gives him an honest, steady look.

AURORA
(shyly)
I only wanted to take care of
my family.
(a beat)
But that night...that was real
for me.
TOM

God, you are sweet.
He wipes her tears with his fingertips.
TOM (CONT'D)
Don't worry about your family.
I can help them.
AURORA
(brightening)
Really?
She clasps her arms around his waist.

He holds her for a moment, pulls away, goes to the bed,
resumes packing.

She stands there, watching him. After a moment, he turns
his head.

She smiles.

Tom is coming around the corner. He has a caddy bag slung

over his shoulder. It's filled with golf clubs. He sets
the bag down, walks toward John.

TOM (CONT'D)
What brings you here?
JOHN
I might ask you the same
thing.
TOM
Well, this is still my

He wants to talk to you.

Gloria thinks.

JOHN (CONT'D)
-.-Gloria?

GLORIA
All right.

John hands the phone to Tom.

TOM
(smug)
Hi, sweetheart. How ya doin'?

GLORIA
Get to it, Tom.

TOM
Get to what? I just want to
say hi. Nothing wrong with
that, is there?

GLORIA
I have nothing to say to you.

TOM

(sing-song)
I know something you don't.

GLORIA
I don't think so. Take a good
look around, because it's the
last time you're going to see
my house.

TOM
You know, I never did thank
you...

GLORIA
For what?

TOM
For Aurora. She makes me feel
young again. I don't know how
I could ever repay you.

He snaps the phone shut and tosses it back
catches it, a little bewildered.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Aurora is standing in front of the mirror,
herself, admiring the earrings.

EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - DAY

Tom walks slowly over to the caddy bag. He
club, inspects it, makes a couple of short

TOM
..-You know, in business,
there's a risk that the people
who are closest to you will
betray you. It's happened to
me; somehow, I've always found
a way to get satisfaction. But
what you did to me wasn't just
business. And so I find myself
looking to the outer edges of
acceptable behavior to make
myself feel better...

Suddenly, Tom rears back and swings the golf club

squarely into John's midsection.

John folds over, howls in pain and drops to the ground.

TOM (CONT'D)
(building)
How'd it happen?

John tries to crawl away, hissing his agony through
clenched teeth.

TOM (CONT'D)
She come to you? Talk you into
it?

Tom draws his lips back in a snarl, tightening his grip
on the club.

TOM (CONT'D)

What did she tell you -- that
I was a terrible husband?

(a beat)
That you were meant for each
other?

(a beat)
What kind of promises did she
make?

He raises the club over his head, then smashes it down on
the glass-topped table. The glass explodes.

He's breathing heavily now. He has a hard, implacable
look on his face.

TOM (CONT'D)
(grinning
humorlessly)
Look at you.
(a beat)
You know, I almost feel sorry
for you...

He heads into the house, still holding the club.

John rolls around, breathing in rasping gulps.

Beaumont is on the phone. We hear a woman's voice on the
other end of the line.

BEAUMONT
So what're you gonna do now?

WOMAN (0.S.)
I'm going away for a while.

BEAUMONT
Really? Where to?

WOMAN (0.S.)
Someplace far away.

BEAUMONT

Sounds nice. I guess you made
out pretty good, didn't you?

A darkened room. We are close on a phone.
WOMAN (0.S.)

I need you, I'll know where to

A woman's hand cradles the receiver.
The woman turns, and we see her face. It's Aurora. (She
has been speaking without an accent.)

EXT. MOTEL - DAY 80

John emerges from one of the rooms. Gloria is at the
door, kissing him goodbye. She closes the door and he
heads toward his car.

Standing in the shadows, across the courtyard, watching

everything, is Aurora -- or at least the woman we have
come to know as such.

FLASH CUT:

INT. BEAUMONT'S CAR - DAY 81

Beaumont is at the wheel. Aurora is in the passenger
seat. They're parked outside the racetrack. She hands him
a thick envelope. He opens it. There's a packet of bills
inside. He smiles and begins counting them.

FLASH CUT:

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY 82

Tom strides out of his office building, carrying his
attache case. He looks up and down the crowded street,
then starts walking.

After a moment, he blends in with dozens of other people.
Men in tailored suits and women in stylish dresses.

We notice one of those women now. Her hair is wrapped in
a silk scarf, and her eyes are concealed behind dark
sunglasses.

As Tom passes her on the sidewalk, she turns around to
look at him. She takes off her sunglasses. It's Aurora.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY 83
Aurora walks down the hallway, coming from the back of
the house, carrying a suitcase.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 84
Aurora sets her suitcase down.

She looks around.

There is a vase filled with fresh-cut flowers on a table.

She moves the vase slightly, rearranges the flowers a
little. She steps back and admires them.

Tom comes down the stairs with his suitcase.

TOM
Is that all you have?

She smiles. Her bejewelled earlobes glitter.
AURORA
(with an accent)
Yes.
TOM
Let's go.
EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY 85

Tom's car is parked out front. The top is down. Aurora is
in the passenger seat.

Tom has the trunk open. He tosses in the suitcases, then
the golf clubs. He slams the trunk shut. He opens the
driver's side door, gets into the car, closes the door,
keys the ignition.

EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - DAY 86
John staggers to his feet, doubling up. He looks dazed.

His eyes are dull. He teeters at the edge of the pool for
a moment, and then he plummets into the water.

Yes. As long as I'm with you.
INT. GLORIA'S CAR - DAY 89

confusion -- and then realization.
