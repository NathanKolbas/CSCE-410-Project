behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to

INT/EXT. ALTAMONT FAIR - NIGHT 1 *

LUKE GLANTON; 28, handsome; has sex with a GROUPIE in his *
trailer. Very animal. They finish. *

He zips up a motorcycle jacket over two faded prison tatoos,
strides from his trailer through the corridors of the arena,

passing other performers on his way to the main ring. He *
ears echoing strains of DEATH METAL on the PA mix & a *
cheering audience. *
INT. ALTAMONT FAIR MAIN RING- CONTINUOUS 2 *
Luke climbs onto his bike, revs the engine. Roadies slap his
back, give him high 5's. He is joined by 2 motorcyclists.
ANNOUCER OVER P.A.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girts, get ready to be rocked
by the motor-cycle mayhem of... *
A spherical, metal cage sits under the Big-Top. Next to it
stands an ornate portico with a red velvet curtain as a door.
ANNOUCER OVER P.A. (CONT’D)
Luke Glanton and his Rough Riders!
The two motor-cycles ride ahead of Luke through the curtain
and into the cage. Luke bursts through, stops, revs his
engine and pumps his fist at the roaring crowd.
ROMINA GUTIERREZ, 26, Hispanic; sits in the bleacher seats, *

watching the spectacle. Enraptured.

Luke drives into the cage where the other riders make long,
Lazy loops. Luke guns it, guides his bike over the inside
walls of the cage. He defies gravity while weaving his way
around the other two stunt riders. He makes it look easy. But
it isn't. It is a death-defying act of bravado.

The other two drivers leave the cage and Luke performs his
finale; a slow inside loop where his bike leaps from one
facet of the cage to another. The crowd goes wild.

ANNOUCER OVER P.A. (CONT’D)
Let's hear it for Luke Glanton and
his Rough Riders, folks!

LATER 3

bights are up. Luke sits on his bike, signing autographs and
taking pictures with a gaggle of extremely psyched 8-year old
boys. Luke clearly enjoys being the coolest thing in the
world to these kids.

Romina walks against the surge of people exiting the arena.
Luke catches sight of her; he drops what he's doing.
PINES WHITE SCRIPT AS OF 6/14/11 2.

LUKE
Hey!

ROMINA
gsnitting, awkward)
I didn't know if you'd remember.

Luke looks at her like she's crazy. His fans tug on his
clothing, vying for his attention. He pushes through them to
get closer to Romina. They give each other a little hug,
careful not to smush the youngsters all around them.

LUKE
You wanna go somewhere? You got
plans tonight?

ROMINA
(shrugs )
I gotta go. I just wanted to see
you again.

LUKE
Can I give you a ride home?

She remembers the thrill riding on the back of Luke's bike.

ROMINA
I'm fine. I can just take the bus.

EXT. ROUTE 5 - NIGHT 4

Luke tears away from the Arena. Everything around looks run-
down, abandoned. We are in Schenectai a smaller, upstate-
New York version of Detroit. It is 1994.

Romina rides on the back of his bike, her arms holding tight
around his abdomen. The wind blows hair into her indecisive
face. She really should be on the bus right now. But the air
is cold and Luke's body is warm. She buries her face into the
back of his leather jacket.

EXT. TWO-FAMILY HOUSE - LATER 5

Luke pulls up in front of an old, two-family house. Romina
gets off, looks over her shoulder; the living room light is
ON. She says, "thanks" and gives Luke a peck on the cheek.

LUKE
That's it? You don't wanna talk, or
anything...

ROMINA

(hiding something)
I can't. I think about you a lot.
PINES WHITE SCRIPT AS OF 6/14/11 3.

LUKE
So then lets hang. We pack up after
tomorrow night ' s show and I
probably won't be back this way for
another year. At least. Wanna get a
beer or something?

ROMINA
(comes close, whispers)
I'm with someone... I just wanted

to see you again...

She kisses him again quick, wishing she could stay. Then runs
away, not looking back, up the steps of her childhood home.

LUKE
Say 'hi' to your mom.

Luke starts his bike, tears out of the neighborhood, tires
squealing smoke, blackening the street.

EXT. ALTAMONT FAIR. NIGHT. 6
Engine gunning, Luke circles the inside of the steel cage in
a rage. He is on the verge of crashing. The audience rapt.
LATER 7
ROADIES and performers pack up the steel cage. Luke wanders
through the activity and ignores the throngs of kids seeking
autographs. He searches the fair for Romina. She is nowhere
to be found. He mounts his bike.

EXT. ROUTE 5 - NIGHT 8

Raging, Luke drives fast through the night streets.

EXT./INT. TWO FAMILY HOUSE - LATER. 9

MALENA, 47, Guatemalan, opens the door in nurse's scrubs.
Instantly, "she recognizes Luke.

LUKE
Hello mama.

MALENA
She's no here.

LUKE
(sighs, resigned)
Is the man of the house home?

Luke hears a BABY crying from inside. Malena tries to hide it
by closing the door so only her head is visible.

PINES WHITE SCRIPT AS OF 6/14/11 4.

MALENA
Nobody's home...

Malena is short. And Luke peeks over her into the house. SEES
- a few baby toys scattered in the floor. Luke looks down.
Malena relents. She can't keep him away from the truth any
longer.

INT. TWO- FAMILY HOUSE- CONTINUOUS 10

He gets past her. Looks around the house. Follows the sound
of the crying baby upstairs. He pushes open the door to
Romina’s bedroom.

A BABY wails in the center of a twin bed surrounded by
pillows. Malena comes in, scoops him up, starts to bounce and
"shush" him. Luke stands near the door, rocked.

MALENA
You wanna hold him?

Luke is unsure. He awkwardly, but gently accepts the baby
into his arms. Luke and the baby stare at one another. Tears
well in Luke's eyes as he falls in love with his son. Malena
smiles.

LUKE
Romina still work at the diner?

Malena tries to give nothing away.

INT. OLYMPIC DINER - LATER 11

Luke walks into the diner. He’s pissed, looks around but
doesn’t see Romina.

Luke doesn’t sit. He waits. Romina exits kitchen with a tray
of food. Sees Luke immediately.

ROMINA
What are you doing here?
LUKE
Oh, I don’t know... You think we

have anything else to discuss
before I take off again tomorrow
forever?

Romina is frozen for a second. She knows that Luke knows her
secret. She walks to a table with her tray of food. Luke
stands still. Waits for her to come back.

When she returns, she is flustered.

LUKE (CONT'D)
You weren't gonna tell me?

_ ROMINA
It was just a fling.

ROMINA .
I haven't heard from you in a year.

LUKE
I know it. It's not 'cause I
haven't thought about you...

ROMINA
I haven't been waiting to hear from
you, or anything.

LUKE
What's his name?

ROMINA
Jason.

Luke and Romina look at each other in silence.

ROMINA (CONT'D)
I'm going to school nights now.

LUKE
(quickly)
Good for you.

ROMINA
I don't have a lot of time for
anything except Jason and school
and wor. And my boyfriend.

Silence. A challenge.
LUKE
Great. Sounds like you got
everything you need.

Luke turns and_ walks away from Romina. She is crushed as she
watches him walk away. e gets back to work.

JACK

Why?
LUKE

I need whatever's coming to me now.
You can cut off the next two days.

JACK
I don't give out advances.

LUKE
It's not an advance. I quit.

JACK
You can't quit.

LUKE
I'm taking the bike too.

JACK
You can't take the bike.

It's my bike.

Jack sighs. He leans forward and pulls a wad of bills from
his back pocket. He peels off some bills.

it in his boot.

LUKE
Wow. Look at you. You look like a
princess.

ROMINA

What are you still doing here?

LUKE
I’m here.

He holds out the bag of BISQUICK.

LUKE (CONT’D)
You like pancakes? I like to make
people ancakes . I got a special
way with 'em. You wanna know my
secret ingredient? Huh? LOVE.
They're not the kind of pancakes
you get at that greasy place you
work. You know?

Romina nervously looks back into the house.

LUKE (CONT'D)
And anyway... I'd like to make you
and Jason some of my special
pancakes. Would you allow me to do
that?

ROMINA
This isn’t a good time.

KOFI (0.S.)
Ready?

Romina turns. Sees KOFI CANKAM - 28, black, wearing a suit
come down the stairs carrying Jason in his arms.

ROMINA
(back to Luke)
We're going to church.
Kofi opens the door. Steps out onto the porch. Faces Luke.

KOFI
I know who you are.

LUKE
Well you got me at a disadvantage.

Luke sees his son, Jason, dressed in a white baptismal gown.
He is less frightened of his own son now. In fact, he wants
to hold him. He gestures to Kofi.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Do you mind?

Kofi doesn’t want Luke to take Jason away from him.

ROMINA
It’s okay. Let him.

Kofi hesitates. Concedes that he really has no choice in this
matter. He hands Jason to Luke.

KOFI
Watch his neck.

Luke and the baby stare at one another.
LUKE
Whoa. He looks like a little
prince.

Romina watches Luke and Jason, smiles. Tears well in her
eyes. Kofi sees it all happen.

KOFI
So, when do you leave town?

Luke doesn’t answer. Instead, he asks his own question.

LUKE (TO KOFI)
How long you lived here?

Kofi has had enough but is playing along.

KOFI
Couple months.

LUKE
Little cheaper than having your own
place, I suppose...

ROMINA
Kofi’s helping us buy this house.

LUKE
Wow. You move fast huh?

KOFI
I’m not moving at all actually.

LUKE
How much they want for a place like
this anyway?

KOFI
Bout a hundred and twenty five
thousand. Why? You in the market?

Romina reaches in and takes Jason from Luke.

ROMINA
Okay we have to go. Or we’re gonna

Luke counts his paltry sum. Sighs.

Luke gets up and starts to walk away.

ROBIN (CONT'D)
Now don't be like that. You know

a thief. It takes a man to steal.

LUKE
You don't know a thing about me.

ROBIN
Oh, please do pardon me. I
certainly hope my misjudging you in
this way didn't hurt your feelings
too deeply. Tell me you've stolen!

LUKE
I've stolen.

ROBIN
But you did it stupid, right? You
got liquored up and knocked over a
convienience store or something?

LUKE
I didn't need to be liquored up.

ROBIN

Fair enough. But you got caught...
I know you like you're my own flesh
and blood. Your problem wasn't your
lack of courage. It was your lack
of foresight. Your plan failed you.
Look, how would you like to do it

all, thank your for considering me.
Second of all, fuck you. I gota

Avery hears Luke's heart monitor beep erratically. He watches
the doctors act more frantically. Finally, the heart monitor
emits a flat, even tone.

The sound of screaming. Avery looks and sees Romina wailing
and fighting with ER staff. Kofi helps to restrain her.

An INTERN straddles Luke and starts to give him CPR. A nurse
closes a curtain around Luke.

herself. Avery turns up the volume.

AVERY
How are you? How's your boy, Jason?

ROMINA
Do you really care about my boy?
You care about my family? Or is
this just small talk?

Avery can't keep eye contact, her eyes full of venom. He
looks down, notices that Romina is pregnant.

AVERY
I'll just take a coffee...

Romina walks back into the kitchen. Avery watches her go.
Scott Stevens approaches and sits down. Both men shake hands.

scoTtT
Thanks for meeting me. You order?
I'm starving.

Scott puts his hand up and waves for Romina. "Ma'am!"

SCOTT (CONT'D)

We're dealing with a case, DeLuca
and me. And it's pretty sensitive.
I'm hoping this can stay private.

Avery is listening. Romina comes back to the table, trembling
with fear and rage. She pours Avery's coffee.

SCOTT (CONT'D)
Tuna melt. Large iced tea.

Scott hands her the menu, notices who she is, makes big eyes
at Avery. She turns to Avery, waits for his order. Avery
can't tell if she is terrified or angry. Probably both.

AVERY
I'm fine with coffee.

She takes his menu, walks away. Scott looks at Avery like a
kid who has just gotten away with something.

scoTtT
Small fucking world.

AVERY
What'd you want to talk about?

Right. I knew I could come to you.
You could really help us bust this

money for an operation and the list
of regulations... It's insane. As
long as your arm, right?

Romina returns with the ice tea. Scott adds 4 sugars.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

DeLuca and I thought, you know,

114 INT. ELAN'S STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 114

Girls on stage grind to music and will do anything for a

We'll use it and then get it or
something exactly like it back to

AVERY
For this one investigation?

Scott and DeLuca look at one another.

SCOTT
Well, yeah, for this investigation.
But we were hoping this could be
like something we're all involved
in. periodically. If we need it.

A COKE-HEAD moves quick through the club and ducks into the
bathroom. DeLuca eyes him, lets it slide.

What are you saying? You want us to
bribe you or something? To do your

AVERY
I'm not asking for fucking bribes.
Just assurances. I want to do

DeLuca grabs the man by his hair, jerks his head _ back, looks

Avery leans in and whispers.

AVERY
Listen. You have any idea what kind

AVERY
This is your last chance.

JUNKIE

The other cops hoot with laughter. Avery is mortified by the
man's defiance and the ultimate ghetto insult - no man calls
another man a bitch without a fight. Avery slams the junkie
up against the tree.

AVERY
Give me a fucking name.

Avery's presses the mans face against the tree. He pulls his
head back and slams against the tree again. Deluca puts his
hands on Avery’s shoulder.

Whoa. Wait a minute. I want you to

follow. “oh my fucking ged." Avery stops. Sees, Deluca's

what you would call a low impact
man. I remember as a boy looking at
him in his judges gown and thinking
my dad is a super hero. Now looking
back I think I was not so far off.
My father had that all important
quality as a Judge of being both
compassionate and ferocious at the
same time. He was not afraid to
make enemies and because of that_he
made many friends. Before he fell
into a coma I was able to tell him
that I was dedicating my run for
Senate to him.

EXT. AVERY'S HOME. POOLSIDE. DAY. 139

Avery is sitting in an patio chair, trying to lead a
conference call with his political advisors. They discuss
details of his campaign.

A.J. walks out of the house with a big beach towel, sets it
on a chair. He takes off his shirt and stands on the edge of
the pool, watching his dad talking on the phone.

Avery looks at his son, shirtless, skinny, pale, standing on
the edge of his pool. As if A.J. senses his dad’s inspection,
he jumps and cannonball’s into the pool.

He makes a big splash and lots of noise. Avery takes the
conference call inside. A.J. is left in the pool alone.

you. That he truly did. And I know
if he could see you now, he'd be

Robin has walked Jason to the edge of his property.

He turns and walks to where Jason has parked his bike. Grabs
it. Walks it back to Jason.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

He holds it up for Jason, ensuring he gets on. Jason does.
Robin pats his ass and sends him on his way. Jason feels
pretty dejected. He pedals away.

Jason enters a pharmacy. Surveys nervously. He knows what he
wants and he scans the aisles until he finds the cough
medicine section. Scans the cough medicine until he finds
boxes of little red Coricidin pills. Looks nervously around -
puts a bunch of boxes in his sweatshirt. Now he's really
nervous but tries to play it cool. A CLERK stands in front of
the door as Jason walks towards it.

CLERK
Take the shit outta your pockets.

Jason keeps going. The guy tries to stop him. Jason breaks
free and runs out the door. Outside Jason grabs his bike and
tries wildly to run with it as he's jumping on. The guy
chases after him. Jason peddles like mad. Barely gets away.

Sound of music, bass thumping. Jason rides his bike up to a

The MUSIC is so loud that you cannot have a conversation
without screaming in someone's ear (ala FIRE WALK WITH ME).

Jason makes it through the crush of dancing bodies, finds
A.J. in a crowd of kids. They shout to tal

They give hugs. Jason is all wet and sweaty.

A.J. (CONT'D)
Damn, bro. You stink!

JASON

A.J. leans in to shout in Jason's ear.

A.J.
You got the skittles?!

Jason produces the boxes of Coricidin from his hoodie
pockets. A.J. is beyond psyched. He grabs the boxes and
immediately shows off the score to friends around him.

A.J. starts handing out the skittles to party goers. An
adoring group forms quickly around him. Jason looks on
somewhat dejected. He approaches the group and waits his turn
to receive.

He holds out his hand. A.J. pops 6 little red pills in his
palm. Jason eats them like candy. Someone hands him a beer.
He takes a long slug.

In time the party | starts to slow down. Lights blur. Music
seeps deep into his consciousness. He goes and sits down on a
couch. Watches ASHLEY, a girl with an endless mid-riff, dance
before him: so beautiful, so sensual. Jason falls into’ the
spell of everything.

The girl beckons him up off the couch. He gets up. She keeps |
dancing so good. He does his swing two step from earlier t

go and moves away. Leaving his girl in an animal embrace. *

Drugs really setting in now, Jason's unstable. He winds his

them in a moment of pure exploration.

can't make out anyone's face, as hard as he squints.

He looks down at the floor to try and center himself, but the
rug is vibrating. Jason steadies himself against the "wall.
The wall is covered with photos. Jason zeroes in on a photo
of A.J. when he was young sitting in Grandpa Al's lap. Jason
is sucked in, he moves to the next and the next; pictures of
a fractured and empty family.

Jason finds himself at the end of the hall looking at Avery's

A.J.

JASON
Stop it! Just fucking stop it!

A.J. is in hysterics. Jason swings the gan sideways and fires
a shot into the floor beside A.J.'s hea It tears through
the hardwood floor, kicking up a cloud of sawdust and smoke.
The muzzle flash burns A.J.'s face and deafens him. He goes
silent his ears ring with deafness.

Avery is in his car, slowly driving up the driveway. The
garage door is automatically moving up.

Avery, on the phone, steps out of his car, stares up at his
house — he thought he just heard a gunshot. He forgets to
close the car door behind him.

AVERY (INTO PHONE)
Gotta call you back.

He pockets the phone, deep concern in his eyes. He runs under

Avery's car is parked away from the side of the road. Jason
pushes Avery deep into the woods. Avery limps.

You'll be in jail for the rest of
your life if you do this. You
understand that?

JASON
What do you think I'm going to do?

AVERY

I'll give you the phone. You can
call it. That way you don't have to
worry about me tricking you.

Avery gladly complies. Jason wings the device against the
nearest pine tree. It shatters into a hundred pieces.

AVERY
Oh Jesus.
JASON
Take off your jacket.
Avery hesitates.

JASON (CONT'D)
Take off your fucking jacket!
PINES WHITE SCRIPT AS OF 6/14/11 110.

Avery complies. Hands his jacket to Jason. Jason digs into
the pockets, grabs Avery's keys and his wallet. Pockets them.

JASON (CONT'D)
Keep going.

Avery turns, continues to limp into the woods, his hands up.

JASON (CONT'D)
I know who you are, but you don't
know who I am, do you?

AVERY
I_don't_know... I'm sorry. Just
please let me know if my son is
okay. Is A.J. okay?

Jason hits Avery in the head with the pistol. He topples
over.

JASON
Shut up! I told you! I told you!
He's fine! Don't you fucking
listen? He's fine!

AVERY
Oh, my son! My son!

Avery wails. Jason tries to get a hold of himself and the
situation.

JASON
Shut up! Stop crying!

Jason puts the muzzle of the pistol against Avery's head.

You’re not crying for him. You’re
crying for yourself.

Avery stops wailing for moment. He stares at Jason, and with
a flush of realization, it all come clear to him.

AVERY
I know who you are. I'm sorry. I'm
so sorry! You shoulda just killed
me, not my son.

Jason points the pistol at him.
AVERY (CONT’D
I deserve it. I should die. But not
my son. Not my poor son.

Avery wails. Jason aims at Avery, prepares for the rapport of
his pistol.

AVERY (CONT'D)
You shoulda killed me.

Jason lowers the pistol to his side. He can't do it. He's not
a killer.

more faint.

Notices the faded picture of his family. *

EXT. PINE BARRENS - CONTINUOUS 214
Avery's wails become slow and more quiet until they transform

INT. AVERY'S HOUSE- CONTINOUS 218

Avery heads up stairs. People talk to him, but he can't hear
it. He heads into his bedroom.

MORE APPLAUSE.

Sitting on the edge of the bed, wrapped in a blanket and
absentmindedly holding a bottled water is a dazed and
exhausted A.J. His head is bandaged, but he is alive.

AVERY (V.O.)
Thank you all so very much.

Avery is stunned. He thought his son was dead, It all feels
like’ a dream. He runs over to A.J., Gathers his son in his
arms. Both of them cry.

sunset years telling our children
and our children’s children what it
was once like in the United States
where men were free.

Romina opens the mailbox. Sorts through letters. Finds one
with no return address. She opens it.

INSIDE, she finds the old, faded picture. She sees herself in
a happier time. Surrounded by love.

EXT. ROAD - DAY 221

Jason walks down a long, straight road surrounded by flat
farm land in all directions. It's winter, and his coat is
inadequate for the season. Behind him in the distance stand
the Rocky Mountains. He turns left and heads down a long
driveway which leads to a farm house.

EXT. SECLUDED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 222
Jason rings the doorbell. An OLD MAN opens the door, waits.
JASON

Hi... We emailed? I told you I'd be
coming today?

OLD MAN
Oh, right, of course. Wow, you're
early.
JASON
There's only one bus out this way a
day.
INT. SECLUDED HOUSE - LATER 223

Jason sits at the breakfast table, clutching a coffee cup for
warmth, with the old man and his WIFE.

OLD MAN
You're not from around here, huh?

JASON
How do you know that?

OLD MAN
I'm as observant as the next guy.
You just passing through?

at the barn. We'll go take a look,
okay?

224 EXT. GARAGE - LATER 224

Jason and the old man stand over a dirt-bike which is much
like Luke's old Fair special.

OLD MAN
Runs great. Gotta a lot of miles on
it, but I kept the maintenance up.

JASON
Can I take it for a test drive?

OLD MAN
Okay. Go on ahead and take ‘er down
the driveway.

Jason hands the old man a stack of bills.

JASON
Here. You can hold onto this. For
like collateral.

OLD MAN
That's okay.

JASON
No, really. It's a little more than
what you were asking.

Jason holds out the money until the old man accepts it. He
then straddles the bike. He starts it up with confidence.

OLD MAN
You ever ridden one of these
before?

Jason can barely hear the old man over the engine. He does a
tight donut and guns the engine as he takes it down the
driveway. He turns left at the road and rides with the
Rockies at his back.
