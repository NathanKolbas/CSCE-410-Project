INT. KENMORE SQUARE SOVEREIGN BANK —- EARLY MORNING

We are inside a bank in the morning hours, just before it
opens. We hear the VOICES of people as they approach. A
spear of daylight precedes a woman’s hand. Keys turn in
reinforced locks, releasing strongbars.

A WOMAN, CLAIRE (30) the bank manager and A MAN,
DAVID, (37) the assistant manager, enter, talking
casually.

The BANDITS move with JARRING SPEED AND VIOLENCE.

They wear BLACK JUMPSUITS, hold ASSAULT RIFLES and wear
Halloween masks.

The FIRST BANDIT, DOUG (35) GRABS CLAIRE by the arm and
leads her toward the back.

The SECOND, JEM (34) KICKS the coffee tray from David's
hand, staining the wall, then knocks him to the floor
with the butt of his AK-47 rifle.

Doug leads Claire down the short hall, taking her KEYS
and handing her off to GLOANSEY (32) another thief, who
pushes both employees to the floor behind the teller
cages, and YANKS OFF THEIR SHOES.

Doug passes the FOURTH, (DEZ, 28) -- with a RADIO WIRE in
his ear

GLOANSY
Close your eyes. Don’t move.

Doug aims his rifle at the David and Claire:
DOUG
Where’s the vault key?
INT. BANK, VAULT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Doug stands behind Claire while Jem holds Bearns in front
of the closed VAULT.

DOUG
What’s the time lock set for?

CLAIRE
Nine when the bank opens.

DOUG

If you’re not telling the truth
we’re gonna kill you're friend.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:
The digital clock on the vault door reads 8:17.

CLAIRE
...eight eighteen.

DOUG
When it hits, no panic code. Open
it clean. Understand?

Everything has gone very fast to this point. Now it moves
agonizingly slow- They watch it like three people waiting
for an elevator.

The timer CLACKS! Doug inserts the vault key.

Claire reaches for the big dial with a trembling hand.
She rotates it once, then overshoots the next number.

JEM
Now you’re stalling.

Jem has his gun pointed at Bearns’ head. Claire makes a
mistake and the TUMBLERS RESET.

JEM (CONT'D)

(re: Bearns)
Do you like this lefty? ‘Cause I’m
gonna drop him like a hot rock.

DOUG
(calmer)
How many attempts before a duress
delay?

CLAIRE
Th-three.

DOUG
You want us here another fifteen
minutes?

Claire reaches fast, but Doug grabs her wrist, holding it
steady: it looks fragile in his gloved hand.

DOUG (CONT'D)

Breathe. Once you start, do not
stop.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

Claire reaches for the dial -- begins working the
numbers. After the third turn, there’s a CLACK. Jem
spins the wheel and the vault door OPENS.

INT. SOVEREIGN BANK, INSIDE THE VAULT - CONTINUOUS

Doug and Jem collecting CASH. They rip the color-coded
bands, fanning each thick packet.

Doug deftly removes each DYE PACK from each bundle. We
jump cut and watch him to the same to the TRACERS.

INT. BANK - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As Doug emerges, Dez halts him in the shadows, pointing.

DEZ
ATM.

A STUDENT inside the ATM vestibule at front.

Doug’s attention is pulled to Claire, lying face-down
behind the teller cages.

Her heel is slowly moving Claire peeks at Gloansy, who
is distracted by the student. Her foot PRESSES A BUTTON
UNDER THE COUNTER -- then quickly glides back.

Claire looks the other way... and sees Doug’s mask
STARING at her.

She’s caught. She’s dead.
The Student finally gives up, walking away from the ATM.
Doug stares at terrified Claire. After a beat:

DOUG
We gotta go.

JEM
Bleach it up.

Gloansy pulls ZIP CUFFS from his pocket. Jem and Dez
pull jugs of ULTRA CLOROX from the work bag.
INT. BANK - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Bearns in a teller chair, wrists bound behind his back.
Gloansy is doing the same to Claire as --

CONTINUED:

DEZ
Hold it!
(touching his ear)
Silent alarm, this address.

JEM
Who did it?

DOUG
Doesn’t matter. Let’s go.

BEARNS
Look, no one did anything --

Jem HITS HIM WITH THE RIFLE. Then rains down a flurry of
punches. His knuckles pound Bearns’ temple.

Bearns slumps to one side, but Jem does not let up. He
HAMMERS at Bearns’ defenseless face. Claire SCREAMING.

Jem rises, grabs a bottle of bleach. Moves to empty it
over Bearns’ face. But Doug HOOKS his arm, stopping him.

DOUG
Let’s go. Load the bags.

After hesitating, Jem rises.

Doug takes the bleach, dowsing the teller station. He
returns to the teller station and Bearns’ WHEEZING.

Claire's chair is empty.

INT. KENMORE SOVEREIGN BANK, REAR DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Jem has Claire doubled over near the waiting bags, her
hands bound, his hand gripping the back of her neck.

DOUG
Fuck is this?

JEM
They get us walled in, we need
her.

DOUG

Leave her.

But Jem is already hustling her out, past the Prius. Doug
hates the idea but won’t waste time arguing.
EXT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Gloansy pulls up FAST in the WORK VAN. Doug boosts Claire
into the van with her head kept down.

INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Doug pushing her into the bench, sitting next to her.

DOUG
Eyes shut, no noise.

Doug pulls out a small knife. He tugs at her jacket hem,
CUTTING OFF a strip of fabric -- making her flinch.

The rest of the crew REMOVE THEIR MASKS.

As THE VAN LURCHES FORWARD, he ties it around her head as
a blindfold. He makes a fist and drives it -- STOPPING
JUST SHORT OF HER NOSE. Making sure she can’t see.

He sits back. STUDYING her with impunity.

As he stares at her we have a NON-LINEAR SEQUENCE where
we FLASH BACK TO Doug scouting the bank job, observing
Claire as she came and went from work--but we HEAR a
conversation between Claire and an FBI agent that takes
place AFTER the robbery.

EXT. KENMORE SQUARE SOVEREIGN BANK - FLASHBACK

Doug watches intently as Claire comes to work in the
morning.

FRAWLEY (V.O.)
I’m assuming they warned you not
to cooperate with the police.

CLAIRE (V.O.)
One of them took my driver’s
license and read it to me. Said
he was keeping it.

EXT. KENMORE SQUARE SOVEREIGN BANK - FLASHBACK
Claire gets off, sunset. She is quite beautiful but it
isn’t that, there is something endearing in her dignity,

her poise. Doug watches from a Cadillac STS.

FRAWLEY (V.O.)
Did he say anything else?
INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - WORK ROOM - PRESENT

In two chairs set next to a table, Claire facing FBI
AGENT ADAM FRAWLEY, 36, talented and intense.

Claire's legs are bare, her jacket gone. Her ELIMINATION
PRINTS are being taken by a MALE TECH in blue ink.

CLAIRE
‘If you tell the FBI anything, we
will come to your house and fuck
you and kill you.’

The Print Tech looks up before resuming.

FRAWLEY
And then what?

CLAIRE
Then nothing. We just drove.

FRAWLEY
This was a passenger van?

CLAIRE

I went skiing in Vermont at
Christmas, and we rented a
Villager. I only remember because
we called ourselves the Villager
People. It was like that.

(nothing)
Yes. It was a passenger van.

FRAWLEY
And you never tried to escape?
CLAIRE
No.
FRAWLEY
They didn’t say anything else to
you?
CLAIRE
No.

(pause)
I didn’t try to escape because
they had guns.

FRAWLEY
(smiles reassuringly)
I understand.
(beat)
Then they let you go.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

CLAIRE
Then they let me go.

Claire notices her hand shivering and can’t control it.

FRAWLEY
That’s the adrenaline getting out
of your system. Its normal.

He drapes his jacket over her shoulders.

CLAIRE
Why did they take our shoes?

FRAWLEY
To keep you from running. Or
kicking. Did you see Mr. Bearns
activate the alarm?

CLAIRE
(beat)
No.

Frawley reaches over, turns off his tape recorder.

FRAWLEY
When someone feels their life is
in jeopardy it often has some
residual effects.

CLAIRE
I haven’t even cried.

FRAWLEY
You can expect some bursts of
anxiety--you will definitely cry.
(he smiles)
If there's anything you’re
victim's witness specialist can’t
help with.

He offers his card.
CLAIRE

What are the chances that you’1l
catch them?

FRAWLEY
We're going to do everything we
can.

CLAIRE

They have assault rifles and my
drivers license. Can you please
not give me the Dragnet answer?

(CONTINUED)

FRAWLEY
We have some very strong profiles
for these subjects.

CLAIRE
That’s the Dragnet answer.

He has to smile. Likes her, loosens up.

FRAWLEY

When an armed robbery call comes
into the Boston Police, the first
thing they have done, for the last
hundred years-- is close the
Charlestown bridge.

(gestures around)
There are four hundred bank
robberies a year in Boston, more
per capita, than anywhere in the
world. The world. And one square
mile generates ninety percent of
the perpetrators: Charlestown.
People in the Town have been
handing it down like a trade- like
glassblowing- longer than you or I
have been alive. I don’t
understand it but it does make it
easier when you know what bridge
to close.

(beat, smiles)
Does that help?

CLAIRE
Not really.

FRAWLEY
Why is that?

CLAIRE

I moved to Charlestown three
months ago.

ghs. Let’s his head fall forward, a bit. Brings

it back up.

FRAWLEY
Okay. Aside from me, you are the
last person these subjects want to
see. They don’t want to see anyone
who could link them to this. As
such, you are probably the safest
woman in the the Town right now.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)

But I will come check up on you
which will make you completely
radioactive to these people.

CLAIRE
Thank you.

DINO (PRE-LAP)
You took your time with her.

INT BANK - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snaps shots of fallen ceiling
concrete and a GAPING HOLE in the ceiling. Frawley walks
through.

FRAWLEY
I’m very thorough.

Boston Police Detective DINO CIAMPA (50s), follows,
grinning. FBI agents work alongside local police officers
from the BPD. Dino and Frawley are similarly partnered.

DINO
They ran a Jack-In-The-Box. Worked
a bypass and busted in overnight.

INT. TELLER CAGES - MOMENTS LATER

TECHNICIANS scan the walls with BLUE LASERS for prints.
Frawley and Dino hold handkerchiefs to their noses.

DINO
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

They stop over the blood stain where the assistant
manager fell.

DINO (CONT'D)
Silent bell came from cage two.

Assistant Manager’s at Beth
Israel.

Those were the Verizon lines

Frawley takes in the exploded telephone wiring and then
deadpans, (like the Verizon commercial):

FRAWLEY
Can you hear me now?

DINO
Our guys let the time lock expire
and had the manager open sesame.

FRAWLEY
(ruminating)
Even a ten foot steel safe, only
as strong as the guy with the key.
THE VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

The busted cabinet is smeared with fingerprint dust.

Frawley, examines discarded stacks of cash. Holds up a
bill with a thin magnetic TRACER STRIP attached.

FRAWLEY
Blew the dye packs. Even found the
tracers.

DINO

Good pick. Three and a quarter?
Frawley’s Blackberry goes off.
FRAWLEY
Three and a half.
(looks at berry)
Got the van. Torched.

DINO
Where is it?

FRAWLEY
Where do you think?

SMASH CUT TO:

TITLE: “CHARLESTOWN.”

Helicopter shot of Charlestown. We see the water. The
bridge, the projects --all framing the MONUMENT at the
heart of the neighborhood like a sundial.

EXT. O’NEIL MEMORIAL ICE SKATING RINK - DAY

Establishing. Quiet outside the hockey rink. No cars in
the lot. Few pedestrians.

INT. O’NEIL MEMORIAL ICE SKATING RINK - DAY
Doug enters. The rink is dark and ghostly.

He climbs the bleachers to a dark corner. Jem’s knuckles
are purple around his emerald-and-gold Claddagh ring.

JEM
So -- we're out clean. Nothing
went sour until the end

Awkward silence. Attention on Gloansy.

GLOANSY
Won't happen again.

DOUG
It’s all right.

JEM
I tell you what won’t happen
again.

Jem seems serious, which makes for tension in the group.

JEM (CONT'D)

That joint gets boosted again’
Happy’s keepin’ his hand off the
fuckin’ buzzer.

Jem laughs. Gloansy laughs, panders:
GLOANSY
Four guys come in: Full body armor-
-Ak's--Skeletor masks. He decides
that’s the time to hit the fuckin’
alarm? You gotta be fuckin’ slow.

JEM
Lucky he just got tuned up.

DOUG
What’s the magic number, Drago?

JEM
7-6-7-5-0. A piece.

Whistle from Dez.

JEM (CONT'D)
Minus some consecutives I
incinerated. Plus ten off the top
for the Florist.

We see a look from Doug on the Florist line.

JEM (CONT'D)
Duggy’s share is back at my place.
You two...

Jem hands Dez and Gloansy ORANGE LOCKER KEYS.

JEM (CONT'D)
Your pieces are out front. And
anyone who’s down--I known
Gloansy’s down--it’s a laundry run
to the reservation tonight.

He looks up to Doug.

JEM (CONT'D)
Now what?

EXT. HOCKEY RINK PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Out in back of the rink. It should be evident that these
two are old friends.

DOUG
This shit with the Florist is
gettin’ old.

JEM
Dig dug, do you think I would set
us up for some bullshit? I’m
buyin’ us a marquee score down the
line. If we need to make payments
to get there we make payments.

DOUG
Fuck makin’ payments. We’re takin’
risks and breakin’ him off for
nothing.

JEM
Don’t let your pride get in front
of your money now-- that’s
somethin’ I learned.

DOUG
Now you have money expertise you
acquired I don’t know about? I
known you your whole life.

CONTINUED:

This pisses Jem off.

JEM
Were you with me seven years in
Walpole?

Doug knows how to unwind him.

DOUG
What money did you have in
Walpole?

JEM
(laughing)
Shut the fuck up.

DOUG
Let me ask you something, are we
gonna start takin’ hostages now?

JEM
We’re doin’ what we need to do,
brother.

DOUG

We don’t need to be workin’ with
that piece of shit.

JEM
Why do you hate money, Doug E.
Fresh? You think he’s a piece of
shit? You can tell him tonight.
INT. FLORIST’S SHOP - NIGHT

Doug and Jem enter the shop. It is a dingy little hole.
Jem moves in ahead of Doug who hangs back.

We find RUSTY (65) and FERGUS COLM (THE FLORIST) a sixty
year old former boxer.

Jem approaches the counter and drops a plastic shopping
bag on the counter. He reaches out and shakes Fergie’s
hand, deferentially.

JEM
Fergie.

FERGIE
How are ya, son?

Doug nods to Fergie from behind Jem.

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:

DOUG
How are ya, Fergie?

Evidently this was not sufficiently respectful.
FERGIE
(provocative)
How are you?

Doug doesn’t want a confrontation.

DOUG
Good.

Jem drops an envelope on the table.
JEM
(re: money)
Run that under the sink.
Fergie nods.
DOUG
(to Fergie)
Merry Christmas.

We're on Fergie as the door closes.

INT. INDIAN CASINO - LAUNDERING MONTAGE, MUSIC- NIGHT
--HIGH ENERGY SEQUENCE TO MUSIC. FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR.
--We see STOLEN CASH being exchanged for CHIPS

-- Roulette wheel. High stakes. Jem and Gloansy.

-- Doug at a Blackjack table. Dez comes up and tries to
play. Doug starts losing and makes Dez leave.

-- Roulette wheel stops, Jem losing BIG this time. He
points out a Hot Waitress to distract Gloansy and Dez --
then nicks chips from their dwindling stacks.

-- Doug hits 21. He rises, done, many chips in his tray.

They turn in their CHIPS FOR CLEAN MONEY

INT. FOXY LADY - FROM ABOVE - LATER

The four of them sitting around the stage -- three of
them wasted -- smiling up at a sinuous STRIPPER.

Jem and Gloansy do cocaine with a stripper.

INT. FOXY LADY - LATER

Doug sits for a private lap dance.

EXT. BOSTON - DAWN

The guys make it back to Charlestown just as the sun
crests the horizon.

EXT. BANK BOSTON (KENMORE SQUARE BRANCH) - DAY

A COMCAST CREW in a cherry picker examines the hacked
junction box above the Kenmore Square bank.

Below, Frawley, Dino and the CREW CHIEF examine fresh
wounds in a telephone pole: GOUGE MARKS left by a
lineman's spikes.

CREW CHIEF
They obviously knew how to work
the box but I like how they
zappped the bipper to the back-up
alarm to the D-4 Station.

FRAWLEY
How would you learn that?

The crew chief looks down -- realizing he’s set himself
up for an uncomfortable admission:

CREW CHIEF
Get a job at Comcast.
SAME - MOMENTS LATER
Dino and Frawley alone now, walking back to their cars.
FRAWLEY
Let’s subpoena work logs, employee
records. Start with everyone who
lives in the Town.

ECU: Claire Keesey 321 Monument Ave Boston

And her Picture. Beautiful, even on her license.

EXT. MONUMENT AVE, CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - MAGIC HOUR

Doug is sitting up on the Bunker Hill Monument, holding
Claire’s license, looking down at her place. He watches
as she leaves her house.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

On a long lens, back lit, that time of day she looks like
nothing he has known--he is transfixed...

INT. THE TAP - NIGHT
Brick-walled, low-ceilinged. A dungeon of piss and beer.
Jem sees Doug.

JEM
This is my brother right here.

Jem puts his arm around, slightly drunk. Gloansy rolls
over holding some drinks.

GLOANSY
There’s the man.

JEM
Are we lucky or are we just good?

DOUG
Fuckin’ A, we’re the best.

Doug’s heart is only half in this ritual.

JEM
Let me know when you man up and
start drinkin’ again, I’1l fuckin’
buy this place.

SAME -— LATER

Doug at the bar, observing the scene without expression.
KRISTA COUGHLIN (29) comes up and sits next to him.

KRISTA
I'm starting to feel old.

DOUG
Still look young.

KRISTA
I think we’re being replaced.

DOUG
Maybe that’s not a bad thing.

KRISTA
Not if you got somewhere to go.
(a long beat)
Fuck, we smoked it to the filter,
right?

(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:

She turns to him.

KRISTA (CONT’D)
You want me to come up later?

Doug smiles, maybe a little sad.

DOUG
I'll be right back, Kris.

Doug stands and squeezes through the crowd of drinkers.
He pushes through the front door...

EXT. TAP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

.--and out of the bar. He breathes in the fresh night air
and moves off up the street.

EXT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - LATER

Doug passes Claire’s apartment on Monument Square and
looks up to see the lights on. He stands and looks.

INT. DOUG'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
A KNOCK.

Doug, barefoot, in boxers, pads into the hall to listen.
He sees a shadow in the stripe of light beneath the door.

KRISTA (0.S.)
Dug-ggy.

Her voice is bar-hoarse and bourbon-rich. The knocking
becomes a cat-like NAIL-SCRATCHING.

KRISTA (0.S.) (CONT’D)
I know you’re in there...

The door moves faintly, her body against it. He puts his
hand on the opposite side, holding it still.

KRISTA (0.S.) (CONT’D)
You don’t want to fuck me?

He glances over at his sofa -- where the armrest has
GROOVES where Krista’s NAILS have made their mark.

KRISTA (0.S.) (CONT’D)
(singing lightly)
How do you want to fuck me

Duggggggy?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KRISTA (0.S.) (CONT'D)
(whispers)
I‘1l let you do it.

Then, mercifully, she gives up and retreats down the
stairs; her shadow slipping back...
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY

The morning sun is brilliant in the city. Doug sits in
his car outside Claire’s apartment.

Her front door opens and she exits, cap brim low,
trundling a basket of laundry.

Angle on Doug: thinking...

INT. JAY'S ON THE CORNER LAUNDROMAT - MINUTES LATER

The bell above the door jingles as Doug pushes through
hefting a sack of laundry over his shoulder. He sneaks a
glance at a bank of washers Claire is filling with
clothes.

SAME - LATER

Doug feigning interest in a newspaper, watching Claire's
back as she folds a load of clean whites. They are alone
but for the Greek proprietor and an Old Woman watching

TV.

Claire heads to a CHANGE DISPENSER in back. Over and
over, she tries to feed it a crumpled dollar bill.

Tentatively, Doug approaches with a fistful of quarters.
But as he nears, the dispenser accepts her dollar and
rattles out four quarters -- leaving him stranded. She
returns to folding her laundry.
Doug takes a deep breath -- gathering his courage.
DOUG
(to her back)
Excuse me?

She turns fast, startled to see him there.
There are TEARS IN HER EYES, she tries to smile again.

DOUG (CONT'D)
You all right?

(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:

CLAIRE
I’m fine.

With Doug hovering, she scoops the rest of a load from
the dryer, dumping her clothes into the basket and bee-
lining for the front door.

CROSS FADE TO:

DRYERS

Still churning around him, Doug sits in a bucket seat. A
figure stands above him; it’s Claire.

CLAIRE
Excuse me, hi. Hello?
DOUG
Oh, hey -- how are you?
CLAIRE
Really embarrassed. I wanted to
apologize...
DOUG

No, no. You got nothing to
apologize for.

CLAIRE
I’m having a really bad month, and
it all kind of hit me at once.

DOUG
No problem at all.

Some of her remaining clothes sit folded on the table.

CLAIRE
Anyway -- thanks for the quarters,
and pulling my clothes out. And --

DOUG
No problem.
(steps after her)
Maybe, maybe you can let me buy
you a drink? I don’t even know
what that means but people say it-

She looks up at him, wasn’t expecting this. Says nothing.
DOUG (CONT’D)

Not now. It’s ten thirty in the
morning. At a normal time.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

20.

She’s not saying anything.

DOUG (CONT’D)
I actually don’t even drink
myself. I don’t mind if you do.
Or we can get dinner.

CLAIRE
Uh.

DOUG
This is why I’ve never done the
public ask out before.

CLAIRE
No, I just wasn’t expecting this.
Dinner?

DOUG
That’s what I was going for.
(beat)
But I could also just put some
more quarters in the machine and
mind my business, too.

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD, CHARLESTOWN - SUNSET

The baseba
Doug, Dez

11 field is underneath the Tobin bridge. Jem,
and Gloansy in the empty stands.

JEM
When somethin’s your job, that’s
your job. Are you gonna not go to
work the next day?

DEZ
None of you ever go to work except
me.

DOUG

I got two things I’m looking at, a
Newton thing and a just over here
thing two miles away thing.

GLOANSY
Newton’s a fuckin’ haul ina

Mailboxes etcetera don’t count.

INT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - DAY
The buzzer is ringing. She opens the door. Its Frawley

FRAWLEY
May I come in?

JUMP TO- ONE MINUTE LATER-
They are coming upstairs, she is talking fast.

CLAIRE
I’ve been doing better, actually.
It finally happened, like you
said. My breakdown. Ina
Laundromat of all places...

FRAWLEY
Good. It gets easier now.

CLAIRE
So is there any progress?

FRAWLEY
I think so, yes.

Frawley sits her down on the couch, kindly:

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Tell me about the Laundromat.

Claire lets some of her angst go.

CLAIRE
There was this guy in there, he
was really nice and he asked me
out. I just said yes, sort of in
the moment. He’s a furniture
mover or something, I don’t know.
I’m not sure I’ll go.

FRAWLEY
Oh... good.

22.
CONTINUED:

Not the story he was looking for.

INT. NORTH END RESTAURANT - LATER
Claire and Doug at dinner. Slightly awkward.

DOUG
So, now, where are you from?

CLAIRE
I grew up in Canton.

DOUG
Canton. Nice out there.

CLAIRE
It’s okay.

Their WAITER arrives with their dinner.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
What kind of work do you do?

DOUG
Demolition. Well, the owner named
the company ‘Sky Makers’ -- like

every time we knock down a
building we’re really ‘making
sky.’ But the truth is I hit big
cinder-blocks with little cinder-
blocks and at he end of the day I
punch a card and slide down the
back of a brontosaurus like Barney
Rubble.

(beat)
And we make more dust than sky.

CLAIRE
Don’t sugarcoat it for me.

He laughs.

DOUG
What about you?

CLAIRE
I’m a manager at a bank.

DOUG
Oh, Yeah? That’s a good job.
(off her grimace)
You don’t like it?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

CLAIRE
I did...

DOUG
Not anymore?

Doug wishes he had that question back.

CLAIRE
We were robbed, last week. They
were waiting for us inside. Made
us take off our shoes. I don’t
know why I’m stuck on that, But
now I’m barefoot in all my dreams.

DOUG
But you weren’t hurt.

CLAIRE
No. David was. My assistant
manager. The silent alarm went off
and they...assaulted him.

DOUG
They did that because of a silent
alarm?

She avoids answering. Then, softly yet plain:

CLAIRE

They took me with them. I thought
I was going to die. They let me
out at the beach in east Boston--
where the planes come in.

(beat)
The FBI agent told me this would
feel like I was in mourning.

DOUG

So you're working with the FBI?
CLAIRE

This ne guy, he’s been great.
DOUG

He what, he calls you, checks in?
CLAIRE

Yeah.
DOUG

Are you happy with the
investigation? Progress? Suspects?

I’m not sure that’s the kind of
thing that makes you happy.

DOUG
They haven’t talked to you about
that?

CLAIRE

Not beyond telling me that all
robbery investigations, evidently,
begin in Charlestown.

DOUG
The FBI said that?
CLAIRE
To that effect.
DOUG
They don’t see you as a suspect,
do they?
CLAIRE

No. Why would they?

DOUG
Just, you said they hurt this
other guy and they let you go...

CLAIRE
No. I wouldn’t say that’s the
dynamic between me and the
investigator right now.

DOUG
Just be careful.
(beat)
Do you have a lawyer?

CLAIRE
No.

clear how much this is wearing on Claire by

her silence.

DOUG
You know what? We can not even
talk about this.

CLAIRE
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-

CONTINUED: (3)

DOUG
No- no It’s my fault. I should
keep my mouth shut. I don’t even
know the story.

A quiet beat passes between them.

CLAIRE
Anyway, that’s why I was crying in
the laundromat. And why I’m not
loving my job so much these days.
(beat)
The health insurance sucks too.

She smiles.

EXT. CHARLESTOWN BRIDGE - NIGHT

Doug and Claire walk across the bridge back home to
Charlestown.

CLAIRE
So all this time I had been
thinking, “I found the cutest
apartment, cheap, close to work-
there has to be a catch” Turns out
the neighborhood was built around
a prison years back and the
inmates families moved in. So here
I am, living in a prison
community, known for unsolved
killings and armed robberies.

DOUG
Yeah...that’s a catch. But I don’t-
-who told you all that?

CLAIRE
The FBI.

DOUG
The FBI told you that.

Did she offend him?

CLAIRE
I had asked how one small place
had so many robbers and murders- I
mean not everyone here’s a bad
person...

They walk in silence for a moment. Then Doug speaks
without looking at her.

DOUG

When I was a kid we used to go for
ice cream, at Wizards across from
JJ's bar--where all the big armed
car guys hung out-- they were like
rock stars here. All we ever saw
were the cars and pretty girls...
You heard all about the jobs they
ran and the houses they had up
Billerica, Winthrop... There were
a lot of kids in that ice cream
parlor, faces pressed to the
glass, couldn’t wait to grow up
and be like the big guys--some
did, some went another way.
I was scared of those guys. I just
wanted to play hockey.

(that’s enough)
But it’s all condos here now.

CLAIRE
All us immigrants from the
suburbs.

DOUG

The neighborhood’s gone to pot!
CLAIRE
Easy Lou Dobbs.
EXT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT, MONUMENT SQUARE - LATER
Having said their good-byes, Doug watches Claire go
inside the foyer and unlock the inner door, she turns
back one more time and WAVES to DOUG. He WAVES back.
Stands there for a beat and mutters:
DOUG
What the fuck am I doing?
INT. WARREN TAVERN - AFTERNOON
Different date, different guy.

A colonial-era pub, crowded and upscale. Claire and
Frawley sit by the window.

CLAIRE
You know, somebody warned me that
I shouldn’t talk to you without a
lawyer.

(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:

FRAWLEY
Somebody from Charlestown, right?

CLAIRE
How’d you know?

He considers how to answer this, then:

FRAWLEY
It epitomizes the character of
this place--- suspicious,

parochial, clannish and rude. I
get cursed at every time I walk
into a 7-11, like I’m the bad guy.
This isn’t a very civil
libertarian thing to say but in my
experience the only people who
lawyer up are guilty. Whoever your
friend is, he did something.

BLACKBERRY GOES OFF. He looks at it. Nasal exhale.

CLAIRE
What?

FRAWLEY
Stick up. Chelsea Credit Union.

He shows her his BLACKBERRY IMAGE: A JPEG STILL of the
SECURITY CAMERA--GUY AT A TELLER WINDOW WITH A .22.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
(flips it off)
What would we do without Chelsea?

CLAIRE
So, can I ask you a professional
question and you’1ll tell me the
truth.

FRAWLEY
Depends on the question.

CLAIRE
Am I a suspect?

FRAWLEY
(surprised, amused)
A suspect? Would I ask you out if
I thought you were a suspect?

CLAIRE
I don’t know. Would you?

(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED: (2)

FRAWLEY

Not if I wanted a conviction.
CLAIRE

I might be seeing someone already.
FRAWLEY

The piano mover? The guy in the

Laundromat?
He smiles when he sees, by her reaction, that it is.

CLAIRE
What’s so funny? He’s...

FRAWLEY
No, good. That’s good.

CLAIRE
He’s not a piano mover. And
anyway, aren’t there FBI rules...?

FRAWLEY
Against dating the vic? There is
a rule.
(forces a smile, wry)
It’s not, uh..you don’t do it.

INT. FBI OFFICE - DAY

Frawley sits at his desk, an array of STILL PHOTOS from
the bank’s security cameras spread out before him.

DINO (0.C.)
Look at this.

Dino stands over Frawley’s desk, extending a piece of
paper towards him. Frawley grabs it.

FRAWLEY

DINO (CONT'D)

So when they rob a bank, we go to
the foreman he says ‘oh yeah guy
was here yesterday’ and shows us a
forged time card. But they can’t
play them games at comcast because
it’s a public company--they have
actual rules. If you don’t show up
to work it’s a recorded sick day.
And ‘Dezzy’ has some interesting
sick days.

He names banks that were robbed, the dates of the
robberies coincide with Dez’s sick days. He holds up 8x10
surveillance stills taken from each of the robberies.

DINO (CONT’D)
Bank Boston, Strong Armored,
Arlington Brinks and... Kenmore
Sovereign.

Frawley can’t quite believe it.

FRAWLEY

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - HARD TO TELL
An AA/NA meeting. A SPEAKER shares his story.

While his story goes, we push through the attendees,
coming to rest on DOUG. Speaker points to woman in front.

SPEAKER
That's Janice, she’s my wife.
She's right there. Anyway, I was
dying. But I was hardheaded and I
didn’t think it could change. Like
the guy at the bar-- he sees a
priest pull up a chair. The guy
says to the Priest, “I hate to do
this to you but you’re wasting
you're time. I know for a fact
there is no God.” Priest says,
“How is that?” He says, “Because I
was an explorer at the north pole.
I got lost in a storm once, I was
blinded and freezing to death and
I prayed, if there is a God, save
my life, but God didn’t come.” The
Priest looks at him confused and
says, “but you’re alive...God
saved you.” Guy says, “God? God

never showed up.

EXT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Doug pulls up outside and DOUBLE PARKS. He heads toward’s
her door when she EMERGES FROM IT, surprising him.

DOUG
Hey, I was just stopping by to see
you.

Claire is slightly taken aback, obviously this wasn’t
planned, but not completely unwelcome.

CLAIRE
Hi. Were we supposed to?

DOUG
No, I just wanted to stop by.
Thought maybe we could go out and
do something, spur of the moment.
Whatever.

CLAIRE
Oh, I’m actually on my way out.

DOUG
I can come with you if you want. I
don’t know what you’re doing but--
I can give you a ride, it’s a nice
day, I got nowhere to go.
He smiles. She looks at him.
CLAIRE
Okay.
INT. DOUG'S AVALANCHE - MOMENTS LATER
They get in.

CLAIRE
Wow.

He recognizes her look as amusement. He feels the sudden
sting of foolishness.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
This is not a work truck that
looks as though its been on the
job site recently.

DOUG
I keep it clean for re-sale.

CLAIRE
My car is going to be jealous.

DOUG
I figured I would get the Prius
lecture eventually.

CLAIRE
How did you know I drove a Prius.

Whoops. A few beats for him to come up with something.

DOUG
That wasn’t your Prius I’ve seen
by the apartment?

CLAIRE
I guess so.
(beat)
I thought maybe you'd been spying
on me.
DOUG

Where we going?

CLAIRE
Mass General.

Doug realizes this might be bad for him.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

A hospital
seems more

hallway. Claire leading. Doug sees that she
nervous than he is.

DOUG
You seem worried about something.

CLAIRE
I don’t like hospitals. My brother
died in one.

DOUG
When was this?

(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:

CLAIRE
I was young. He was little. He had
lymphoma.

Before Doug can come up with something to say in
response, he sees they are coming up on a COP sitting in
a chair outside a room. Doug slows.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
It won’t take long. I promise.

DOUG
It’s fine, I can wait out here.

CLAIRE
No, meet him.

INT. HOSPITAL RECOVERY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

David Bearns propped up against an avalanche of pillows,
gauze and bandaging masking his face..

Doug stays put while Claire crosses the room and kisses
his cheek.

CLAIRE
I wish you had let me bring you
something, David.

BEARNS
Uh, people bring so much clutter --
it’s like, what am I supposed to
do with balloons? Make animals?

CLAIRE
(pulling up chair)
So they’re hopeful?

BEARNS
Well, hopeful means I may recover
fifty percent of my sight in this
eye. I just want to get back to
work.

CLAIRE
Really? Back to work?

BEARNS
God, yes. Preferable to large
print sudoku.

CLAIRE
That’s the last place I want to

go.

BEARNS
Well, you have memories, sweetie.
The one inconvenience I was
spared.

DOUG
I’m gonna leave you guys alone.

Doug does an awkward wave, as he retreats to the doorway.

BEARNS
I won’t keep her long. But we will
talk about you.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Claire exits and Doug catches up to her. They walk.

DOUG
Your friend got a tough break.

Claire says something he doesn’t catch. Doug realizes she
has stopped, turns back to her.

DOUG (CONT'D)
What?

CLAIRE
It was me. I hit the alarm. He
just doesn’t remember.

She lets go.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
The FBI instructions are very
clear, we’re told to hit the alarm
when the ‘subjects’ are still in
the bank. That’s what I did.
(emotional)
I could have told them it was me
but I let it happen. Because I
was scared.

DOUG
Hitting an alarm during an armed
robbery is brave. There aren’t too
Many people who do that.
(quieter)
And there was nothin’ you could do
to help your friend.

CLAIRE
Should I tell the FBI?

(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:

DOUG
No. No. Cops are just people. They
just want to find a bad guy so
they can go home and nuke their
supper. And usually whoever’s
runnin’ their mouth the most.

CLAIRE
I should hire a lawyer.

DOUG
I think you need to try to let
this go Claire

CLAIRE
I have to, I know.

She looks at him and smiles, recovering a bit.

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
Thanks.

DOUG
Guidance through the justice
system is how we show affection in
Charlestown.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

They’re now at dinner. A WAITER refills Doug’s glass with
water and Claire’s with WINE.

CLAIRE
(re:wine)

Are you sure this doesn’t bother
you?

DOUG
No, it’s fine.

CLAIRE
But you don’t drink?

DOUG
Nope.

CLAIRE

Don’t like to talk about it?

DOUG
Uh, not really.

(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:

CLAIRE
If you’re worried about making a
bad impression-- I’ve seen your
truck. How much worse can it get?

He laughs.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Your life didn’t go well with
alcohol. You can say that.

He exhales a little. Okay.

DOUG

I don’t mind telling you my life
didn’t go well with oxycontin and
cocaine...but I wouldn’t mind
talking about something else now,
either.

(beat)
And I really don’t know what you
have against my truck.

CLAIRE
(smiles)
Okay.
(beat, teasing)
What about your family? You can’t
shut it down on the family, too--

DOUG
What are you talking about? I’m an
open book.

He smiles.

DOUG (CONT’D)
My mother left when I was six. My
father, uh, we don’t talk. He
lives in the suburbs.

CLAIRE
Your mother left when you were
six?

DOUG
Yeah.

CLAIRE

That’s terrible. What happened?
Doug goes back to his food.

DOUG
She left.

CLAIRE
Doug, I just want to know about
something that tells me who you
are. If I can’t know that I don’t
know what I’m doing here.

Doug just looks at her. Then he starts talking.

Claire doe!
moved.

DOUG

I just turned six. This noise woke
me up in the morning. I thought it
was an animal maybe. I’d never
heard what a man sounded like
just, you know, crying.. When I
saw my father in the kitchen all I
remember is the ashtray. Looked
like he'd been through a hundred
cigarettes. Ash like a little
mountain. He had stopped crying
and he was sitting there watching
TV on our little black and white
with no sound. I think he just
didn’t know what else to do. He
saw me standing in the doorway and
he just goes, “your mother left.
She’s not comin’ back.” Just like
that. Smokin’ cigarettes and eatin
a tv dinner at six in the mornin’.

(beat)
We lost our dog the year before. I
thought “lost” was a place people
went. I wanted to make these
posters so if she was lost she
could call us like they did when
someone found our dog. To this day
my father will tell you he helped
me make those posters. But he
didn’t. He sat there and drank a
case of beer and I went around by
myself on school street asking
people if they seen my mother. I
always assumed she went off and
started another family somewhere
and knowing my father-- I don’t
blame her.

sn’t know what to say. We see she is extremely

into Sex and the City all of a
sudden?

, breaking the tension.

CLAIRE
I‘1l call you, believe me.

DOUG
Well, that’s good.

CLAIRE
At the very least I need someone
to walk me home at night.

DOUG
No...Charlestown’s pretty safe in
terms of street crime.

CLAIRE
Guess I’m just lucky-- or maybe I
attract the right kind of people.

DOUG
What kind of people?

CLAIRE
I didn’t even want to say
anything. I didn’t want you think
i was some kind of crime magnet.

DOUG
If you can’t tell me, I don’t know
what I’m doing here.

CLAIRE
I’m fine. I came out of store
twenty-four and these guys came
grabbed me and kind of shoved me
and were grabbing for my purse but
the store owner saw it and started
yelling-- and I’m at the point
where I felt like, “I’ve been in
the big leagues, you guys are JV
criminals” and they ran off and I
went home and went to bed.

The look on Doug’s face is as deadly serious as we’ve

seen him.

She realizes this.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
I'm fine. It just scared me.

DOUG
No, it’s not fine.

He lifts her sleeve and sees she has a LONG SCRAPE/CUT on
her arm that is ugly from where she was manhandled.

CLAIRE
Doug, I’m fine. I’m just going
through a lot.

DOUG
Did you get a look at, uh, either
of their faces?

INT. JEM’S APARTMENT - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
Doug walks in. Jem is watching television.

DOUG
I’m asking for your help. I can’t
tell you why, you can never ask me
about it after and it involves
hurting people.

Jem stares at him, eyes thoughtful.

JEM
Whose car we gonna take?

EXT. MISHUAM PROJECTS - NIGHT

Doug and Jem cruise slowly through the project streets.
People are out, standing around their cars.

JEM
Like little reddish hair? Reddish
brown? Puerto Rican kid?

DOUG
Yeah.

Yup, Agarid Colazzo, Alex they

DOUG
Alex!

He raps on the metal door.

DOUG (CONT’D)
Alex!

From within.

ALEX
What?!

The door cracks, Alex is about to look through using the
chain but Jem HITS IT with the SLEDGEHAMMER-- sending
ALEX SPRAWLING BACK into his apartment.

Doug and Jem seamlessly continue their momentum and rush
through behind the door.

INT. ALEX COLAZZO’'S APARTMENT, INSIDE - CONTINUOUS

Jem removes an EXPANDABLE METAL STICK and uses it to
CRACK the FAT FRIEND of Alex’s across the face as he
emerges to help.

Doug is all over Alex, punching and stomping him. It is a
very fast, brutal flurry of violence that is more a
beating than a fight--despite the fact that if anything,
Jem and Doug are outsized.

Jem and Doug let up--they stand heaving and sweating over
the two thugs and their demolished apartment.

Jem opens a bag of WHITE POWDER and THROWS some on ALEX’s
FACE and SCATTERS THE REST ON THE FLOOR.

DOUG (CONT'D)
Let’s go. Now!

Jem turns to both of the thugs, thinks for a beat and
takes of his mask.

JEM
You know who I am? Go tell the
cops. ‘Cause I know who you are,

He shakes Doug off him.

JEM (CONT'D)

DOUG
Oh, me, definitely. Embarrassing

Really, which kind?

She is kneeling in the garden and the top of her
UNDERWEAR is revealed above her jeans. The underwear have
LILACS on them.

DOUG
Lilacs.

She half smiles half laughs but doesn’t jump up.

CLAIRE
Me, too.

I’m at the point where I’ve
started having dreams about you.

She stands, brushing away dirt, moving to him.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
I dreamt you worked at the bank.
In one we were both barefoot and
then you were six years old.
You're a little boy in a lot of
them. The thing is-- you’re never
a real person. You never have any
context. You’re just vapor. And it
made me realize, I know you really
well but you’re not real. It’s
like I invented you. Are you real
Doug?

DOUG
I think so.

CLAIRE
All I have is a cell number. It’s

Okay look, it’s not even prepped.
Let me keep working I’1l tell you
when. For now, let’s not be seen
with each other if we can help it.

EXT. PIZZERIA - DUSK

Claire and Doug share a pizza in a Boston Pizzeria. His
is plain. Hers in Hawaiian, pineapple and sausage.

CLAIRE
So, I’ve been telling my friends
all about you.

This is not Doug’s favorite thing to hear.

DOUG

Oh yeah? All good things I hope.
CLAIRE

Mostly good.
DOUG

(smiles)
What do they say?

Her momentary pause tells Doug the answer. Of course.

DOUG (CONT'D)

They can’t believe your luck. You
moved to Charlestown snagged a
rock breaking Townie. Couldn’t
even snag one that owned a scratch
ticket store?

CLAIRE
No...They just think it’s a
rebound. I’m like, rebound from
what? The robbery? Anyway, I feel
sort of estranged from them now. I
think that’s what they’re picking
up on. I’ve changed. I can feel
it. They still have this,
carelessness- which I sort of envy
but at the same time I hardly
understand anymore. It feels like
I'm leaving them behind.

(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:

DOUG
I know what you mean.

People walk by. We feel the day outside.
CLAIRE
My brother died on a day like
this. I was holding his hand.
The sun is bright through the shop.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Now on really sunny days I think
about someone dying. That’s wrong,
isn’t it?
DOUG
I’m sure he’d be glad you’re
thinking of him.

She smiles, the mood is melancholy but they are no less
connected to one another.

Doug gestures to the pizza, the cafe, the day.
DOUG (CONT’D)
I'm having a good time. This is a
good day.
She sets her napkin on the table, pushing back her chair.
CLAIRE
Good. Then you'll miss me while
I’m gone.
Claire disappears inside to the bathroom. Doug sits
back, tipping his chair, looking up at a jet trail in the
sky.
Someone pokes him in the back of the neck.

VOICE (0.S.)
Money, Bitch.

Doug tenses -- but notices the rest of the diners eat
calmly. He turns and sees that it’s Jem.

JEM
I froze you.

Doug glances hard at the pizzeria door.

JEM (CONT'D)
What’re you doing here?

(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED: (2)

Jem steps over the low fence, drops into Claire’s seat.
DOUG
(watching the door)
What?

JEM
Fuck is this? Who you here with?

Jem scoops up Claire’s slice and bites in.

DOUG
No one.

JEM
No one?

Jem picks up Claire’s lemonade glass. He puts his lips
on her straw and SUCKS.

JEM (CONT'D)
What is this?

Doug peels off two twenties, making to stand. He sees the
pizza is “Hawaiian” pineapple and sausage.

JEM (CONT'D)
Is this yours?

DOUG
You wanna get outta here?
JEM
Naw, naw, I’m cool. Let me get a

beer.
The door opens and Claire steps back outside. Doug goes
deaf -- the sound of the ballpark drowning all else, like
a passing jet. Without sound, Claire’s lips say, “Hi.”

“Hey,” says Jem, chewing. He surrenders his seat with a

flourish -- SOUND RETURNING to Doug’s ears.

CLAIRE

I’m Claire.
JEM

Jem.
CLAIRE

Jim?
JEM

Jem. Just Jem.

(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED: (3)

Claire nods, turning to Doug for help.

JEM (CONT'D)
I'ma friend of this loser. He
lives with me. Not with me,
domestic partners. Above me, my
house. Third floor of my house.

Claire sits staring across the table at silent Doug.

JEM (CONT'D)
Yeah, I saw the Avalanche parked
around the corner.

(to Doug)
I told you that thing stands out.

Doug flashes to Jem, realizes he has been following him.

CLAIRE
The Avalanche?

JEM
His truck. The work truck. Duggy’s
quite the worker.

CLAIRE
You two have been friends a long
time?

JEM

Like brothers. Since we were six.
But he never breathed a word about
you, the secrets with this one.

CLAIRE
I’m sorry, did you say your name
was Jim or Gem?

JEM
Both actually. Teachers always
used to say, ‘You can have this
one, he’s a real gem.’ It kind of
stuck.

Claire smiles

JEM (CONT'D)
So what do you do for yourself
there, Claire?

Claire takes up her lemonade. Her lips move to the
straw. She takes a long draw as Doug looks on, helpless.

CLAIRE
I work in a bank.

Doug dead-

JEM
Oh yeah? Which one?
CLAIRE
Kenmore Square.
JEM
Wasn’t that the one -- ?
CLAIRE

We were robbed, yeah

JEM
Yeah I read about that. So how’d
you two meet?

CLAIRE
Um... we met in a Laundromat.

JEM
Love among the bleach. Happens
more than you think.

staring at Jem now. No cracks in Jem’s facade.

JEM (CONT'D)
Don’t you trust a word he says,
Claire.

CLAIRE
You mean he’s not really an
astronaut?

JEM
Well, -- that one’s true. We’re
in the space program. So if you
got any friends interested in
-- manned exploration, preferably

redheads.
CLAIRE
I‘1l let them know.
JEM
Don’t get too used to your life of
leisure here. Duggy -- he’s a

real workaholic...

Jem’s smile vanishes a moment under his dead eyes as he
rises to leave.

JEM (CONT'D)
... always taking his work home
with him.

(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED: (5)

Claire watches him go. She turns to Doug.
CLAIRE
I guess you haven’t been telling

all your friends about me.

DOUG
Not that one, anyway.

He tried to smile it off. She reaches for her lemonade
again, but this time DOUG TAKES THE GLASS from her hand.
INT. JEM’S BASEMENT - DAY

A dank stone cellar of weeping walls. The CLANK of iron
on iron. The basement has been made into a weight room.

Doug comes down the stairs, seeing Jem doing presses.

Jem sits up, veins swollen in his forearms. He sees Doug
and drops a curling bar.

DOUG
You got something to say, say it
now.

JEM
That’s my line here.

DOUG
That was a mistake coming over
there.

JEM

Me?? You're at fuckin’ Stefani’s
pizza with the witness from our
armed robbery!

DOUG
Relax. I know what I’m doing.

JEM
Duggy, if you fuck up in this
life, there are consequences. And
you’re fuckin’ up.
Jem holds Doug’s look.

JEM (CONT'D)
Is it over?

DOUG
Don’t worry about me.

(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:

JEM
I am worried about you,
motherfucker. You’re tryin’ to get
me incarcerated and you’re slow
rollin’ this other deal, too.

DOUG
I haven’t been slow rollin’ shit.

JEM

This pussy must be tight. It got
you on a three week bender and you
don’t even drink. But don’t let it
be some five week delay pussy and
really don't let it be some get-
your-boys-in-the Lewisberg pussy
neither! !

In the face of Jem’s anger Doug gets Zen.

DOUG
We got heat on us right now and
this shit takes time to get right.

JEM
We got heat on us, lets start
fuckin’ all the witnesses. I’m
blowin’ the assistant manager. Did
I forget to tell you?

DOUG
Fuck you. You want to take over,
you're welcome to start.

JEM
Douggy, no one needs to know
you're fuckin’ her and no one
needs to know you’re puttin’ hits
out on Puerto Ricans for her
neither. So get off your ass and
set it up.

Doug turn on Jem, gives in to anger.
DOUG
Jem. It’s been set up. You got
such a fuckin’ hard on to go?
We'll go tomorrow.

INT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Doug enters Claire’s apartment, she sees him arrive on
the top step. He sees her and has a slightly off look.

(CONTINUED)
54.

CONTINUED:
CLAIRE
What?
DOUG
Nothing?
CLAIRE

What is it?
He says this plainly and honestly.

DOUG
It’s just-- every time I see you I
keep thinking I’ve exaggerated in
my mind how beautiful you are and
you can’t really look that amazing
in real life. But then I see you-
and...you do.

CLAIRE
That is...a great line. How girls
are there in Charlestown whose
hearts were broken with that line?

He laughs.

DOUG
None.
(beat)
They’re in Brighton and Malden and
suburban areas.

She moves toward the back and throws the line over her
shoulder:

CLAIRE
I saw your picture yesterday.

This slows him. His instinct kicks in.

DOUG
Sure it was me?

CLAIRE
Pretty sure, yeah.

He holds her look. She’s giving him nothing.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Why do you look horrified. It
wasn’t that bad-- as hockey

pictures go. The hair was bad.

DOUG
Oh. That picture.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Well, when I said I knew you, they
were very intimidated. I felt like
I was dating Tiger Woods.

DOUG
I wasn’t that good.

Doug gets uncomfortable.

Doug plain

CLAIRE
Apparently you were ‘drafted.’ I
don’t know exactly what that means
but I’m fairly sure they don’t do
it to the bad players.

DOUG
You'd be surprised. I got drafted
by the St. Louis Blues, they
aren’t even a team anymore.

CLAIRE
You were pretty good. There was
only one other picture up there
and he was a pro football player
who's on TV now. Howie something.

ly tells her the truth.

DOUG
Yeah, I was good. And I got
drafted. And I didn’t do what it
took to make the team. I wasn’t
smart enough to know it or classy
enough to accept it and when I got
a second chance, I blew that, too.
So when I look at that picture,
all I see is a guy who fucked up
every chance he ever got.

Doug's vulnerability takes him by surprise and has a self-

propulsive

quality.

(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED: (3)

DOUG (CONT’D)

But it’s a good reminder about the

price you pay when you throw away

the most important thing in the

world can I be your boyfriend?
She smiles, surprised.

CLAIRE

I haven't had a ‘boyfriend’ since

sixth grade...
The gap between them closes, and the kiss, once it comes,
is at once both soft and electric.
INT. CLAIRE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Claire and Doug, in her bed. The camera floats over the
bed, alternating between ECUs and slightly wider shots.
Love scene. We don’t hear what they’re saying. The sound
of score and the drift of the camera creates something
impressionistic.
EXT. OUTSIDE CLAIRE’S DOOR - NIGHT
Doug exits Claire’s door, as high as he’s been in a long

INT. DARK SPACE - MORNING

Dez, Jem, Gloansy and Doug huddled across from one

DOUG
We don’t need to get hurt and we
don’t need to hurt anyone else.

call goes out.

GLOANSY

You can throw that out. Depends

You want to close the bridge? Just

FRAWLEY
That’s a metaphor, about
Charlestown, Dino. You don’t
literally “close a bridge.” Do I
want to close a major traffic
artery and compound our
professional embarrassment for a
wives tale? No.

DINO
Okay. Just asking.

FRAWLEY
You know what we should do? We
should tell people to be on the
general lookout for bank robbers

INT. MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER

GLOANSY drives the MINIVAN through the North End. DOUG
and JEM are in the BACKSEAT. They are cruising the North
End. The hold their weapons and masks on their laps so
they cannot be seen from outside the car.

Children trickle in to a parochial school they pass by.

They must circle the block, orbiting while they wait for
the truck to arrive. No one says a word, until:

GLOANSY
Here we go!

The ARMORED CAR turns out onto the street in front of
them and pulls up in front of the bank. Everyone’s
adrenaline level skyrockets.

Doug reaches down and pulls up his mask, pulling it over
his head. Their masks have the faces on the back of their
heads and a sheer black which cover their faces--this has
the disconcerting effect of making one not immediately
sure if they are coming toward you or walking away.

The ARMORED CAR pulls up IN FRONT OF THE BANK and TWO
GUARDS (MESSENGERS) EMERGE. One holds a dolly.

Our guys will time their arrival just as the messengers
are opening the back door of the truck and loading money.

Doug and Jem JUMP from the car, weapons out.
JEM CRACKS Messenger #1 with the butt of the AK.

JEM
Stay on the ground.

Doug takes aim at messenger #2.

DOUG

The GUARD FLAILS. Doug QUICKLY SUBDUES HIM, grabs the
COAL BAG. He stands over the two guards, waiting for Jem.

One GUARD appears to be making a move, DOUG gets the AK

Gloansy fires up the car and they start down the street

CRUISER bearing down on them.

GLOANSY
That was quick.

DOUG
Must have been down the street.

Jem picks the gun back up.

JEM
Light him up.

Gloansy locks up the brakes. The CRUISER comes SCREECHING

Jem and Doug get ready to light up the cruiser with AKs.

Doug sees that behind the cruiser to one side is a
schoolyard FILLED WITH CHILDREN.

DOUG
Wait, wait WAIT!

Jem looks, Gloansy looks.

JEM
Fuck.

EXT. NORTH END STREET - MOMENTS LATER

The minivan comes CAREENING around the corner of a narrow
street, nearly taking out a bench.

A van is parked up on a sidewalk so the minivan is forced
to drive up on the opposing sidewalk.

The cruiser gives chase around several incredibly narrow,
ancient turns and alleys-- built to accommodate
horses(and even those only narrowly) in the 1700's.
Driving though at 60 mph is harrowing.

The chase lasts about thirty seconds until a car PULLS
OUT in front of them AND SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES forcing our
guys to a halt.

The driver of the front car gets out, our guys go for
their guns, we reveal the driver is DEZ in the ‘switch
car’ and our guys are readying themselves to shoot it out
with the pursuing policeman.

The guys jump out of the minivan, and leave it in the
middle of the street, Gloansy grabs the bags of money
while Jem uses the door for cover, taking aim at the
cruiser who has pulled up behind them.

Jem starts FIRING at the car, incredibly loud automatic
rifle report-BANGBANGBANG-quickly disabling it and
forcing the driver out of the car.

Another CRUISER arrives from the street perpendicular,
followed by a third. Jem, supported by Doug, begins
firing at the police. The automatic weapons totally
overwhelm the police officers who retreat quickly under
the loud and terrifying onslaught.

INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS
The back is filled with JUGS OF GASOLINE. Doug OPENS ONE,
dumping as much of it as he can over as much area of the

Gloansy turns onto School street, approaching the
intersection of School and Main streets.

The guys grab their bags in one hand, rifles in the
other, still wearing masks.

As they hit the intersection, Gloansy pulls up behind the
SECOND SWITCH CAR and they JUMP OUT.

EXT. SCHOOL ST. AND MAIN - CONTINUOUS

Dez, Doug, Jem and Gloansy come out of the jeep, carrying
duffel bags in one hand and AK-47’s or tech-9’s in the
other. They stay low and move quickly.

As they get to the second switch car, Doug looks across

him cold. The other four guys stop immediately after.

thirty feet from four guys with bags, masks and assault
rifles.

Angle on our guys: not moving a muscle.

Angle on the cop: his face hasn’t even had time to react
to what’s happening in his brain.

After a long beat, the cop simply TURNS HIS HEAD THE
OTHER WAY, holding his stare in the opposite direction.

Our guys wait a beat, frozen still... Then they simply
pick up where they left off, throw their stuff in the
switch car, fire it up and get on their way.

INT. THIRD SWITCH CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Doug, Jem, Gloansy and Jem all tear off their masks and
start stashing their weapons.

Frawley walks closer to the minivan. The bullet-riddled
cruiser is still behind it. Small yellow markers have
been laid next to all the casings on the ground.

DINO
What do you mean ‘print the van?’
The van is a volcano.

FRAWLEY

Just find something and make it
look like something that looks
like a print.

(circles car)
Because right now they’re burning
the money bands in a safe house--
someone’s cousin’s wife’s sister
who got paid twenty thousand not
to be home for the day. Their
alibis were paid a week in
advance. We won’t find any DNA
here or on the switch car. And
that, as they say, is the end of
that. This is the ‘not fucking
around’ gang. So, get me something
that looks like a print so I can
shake their tree. ‘Cause the not
fucking around thing can go both
ways.

Were they robbin’ bike messengers?
Ten speeds? I’m playin’.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Doug and Dino enter. Dino waves at Doug to have a seat.
There is a seat and three chairs.

DINO
Have a seat, son.

DOUG
Thanks.

DINO
I knew your father.

DOUG
Me, too.

DINO

Got a few years left on his bid.
Doug opts not to reply, knows where this routine goes.

it used to be. Maybe you can
change that when you’re up there.

DINO (CONT'D)
You know we pulled a print off the
van, right?

aque.

DOUG

Let me ask you something. Let’s
say someone is around a group of
people, just by chance. So
naturally, because they associate
with him, he has personal
information about those people.
Work, neighborhood, whatever. Now
let's say that person gives that
information to the police for
money. What do you call him? A
rat. Now lets say that person has
a badge, what do you call him?

(beat points at Dino)
Dino. Dino the dego from
Somerville. The cops need to know
who had an abortion, who got
thrown out by their aunt. Big D.
But let me ask you somethin’,
Dino, the neighborhood expert,
when your friends here decide to
get serious and go on the big
operations, how come they always
put you in the back seat?

The DOOR OPENS and Frawley enters. He walks over to Dino

and stands

beside where he is sitting, across from Doug.

FRAWLEY

Do you know what they teach us at
the academy, Mr. MacRay?

(no response)
During interrogations, always
begin treating the subject kindly
so as to win his trust, the logic
being that you can always turn
ugly later but its very difficult
to start off unsympathetic and
later become a ‘trusted figure.’

Frawley takes a large file, conspicuously labeled MacRay
and puts it on the table between them.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Even in light of that, Doug, I
gotta tell you, I think you’re a
shithead.

He points to photos on the wall of the armored car that
was robbed.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)

And you fucked up-- look at me,
asshole. You fucked up. You didn't
roll a star market in Malden for
boxes of quarter rolls. You hit an
A Car in The North End with AKs
and body armor and left .762
rounds in the fucking streets of
Boston!

He regains his composure a bit.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
400 Bank robberies a year in this
city and guess what wanted number
you are, toolbox?

He holds up his index finger. Number “one.”

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Congratulations, I bet you’ve
never been number one at anything
in your life. Well, it’1ll be short
lived because now you’re
threatening my job and my friend's
jobs and you've jeopardized things
like dollars appropriated to our
division-- matters so far beyond
the extraordinarily limited scope
of your Townie, douchebag mind
that I seriously question the
wisdom of even bringing it up. But
I do want to say this so we're
both very, very clear: because
sometimes, in these circumstances,
various parties bandy about the
possibility of sentence reduction
in exchange for cooperation,
testimony or otherwise assisting
the prosecution.

He leans over the table and looks Doug right in the eye.

(CONTINUED)
72.

CONTINUED: (3)

A moment.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Not this time. You’re here today
so I could tell you personally
that you’re going to die in
federal prison. And so are all
your friends. No deal. No
compromise. So when you start
trying to stab each other in the
back--and you will--I know you
have a pitiable, misguided, Irish
‘Omerta’ but in the end you will
cry and beg--you always do--and
when that day comes... I just want
you to know, its gonna be me who
tells you to go fuck yourself.

 

 

This sinks in.

DOUG
I thought it would be the federal
prosecutor telling me to go fuck
myself.

Frawley smiles.

DOUG (CONT’D)

I’m glad you came in here because
this room smells like piss and
you’re wearing a nice cologne.

They all look at each other.

DINO
So, what kind of tree did we

EXT. COPELY PLAZA MALL, FOOD COURT - EVENING

Early evening crowd, Doug and Claire walking hand-in-
hand. They come towards the food court.

DOUG
Hey I want to show you something.
I wanted to wait for the right
time but I’m gonna abandon that
and go with the food court.

CLAIRE
Okay, what are we abandoning and
doing?

DOUG

I got you something.

Doug reaches into his pocket and produces a BOX. He opens
it and reveals a DIAMOND PENDANT NECKLACE.

DOUG (CONT’D)
This is for you, because you make
me happy and I don’t know how to
thank you except to buy you
something. I know that makes me
shallow but I hope you can see
past that and try to forgive me.

Claire looks at the diamond, amazed and stunned and a
little overwhelmed.

CLAIRE
I’1l work on it.
EXT. TRINITY CHURCH PLAZA - DAY
Sitting on a bench. She is admiring her diamond.

CLAIRE

CLAIRE
How can you afford this?

DOUG
I have a job, Claire. I put away
some money.

CLAIRE
(looks up at him)
I quit my job today.

DOUG
Really, what are you going to do?

She tucks her diamond away.

CLAIRE
Teach maybe. Volunteer more.

DOUG
What if I told you I been thinking
about quitting my job?

She looks up at him and smiles, thinks he is saying this
out of misguided sympathy.

CLAIRE
Then I guess I’ll have company.

DOUG
How many people do you know who
have changed their lives?

CLAIRE
Not very many.

DOUG
I’m gonna change mine.

She recognizes that he is serious.
DOUG (CONT’D)
Why don’t you do it with me. Take
the money we have. Quit our jobs..

She looks at him.

DOUG (CONT’D)
Why not?

CLAIRE
Where would we go?

DOUG
Wherever we want.

She looks away, seems bothered, distracted by something.

CLAIRE
Do you know that newspaper, the
Town?

Doug is thrown for a second.

DOUG
The giveaway paper? Yeah?

CLAIRE
They keep putting it in the foyer
of my building and it just piles
up. I was recycling it the other
day and I saw this face in it I
recognized but I wasn’t sure from
where and then I realized, it was
the guy who tried to mug me.

DOUG
Really?

CLAIRE
Yeah. It was an article about how
he had been robbed and someone
shot him.

She just holds Doug’s look. She could know something. It
could be his imagination.

DOUG
They say who did it?

CLAIRE
No. The Police said they he was
too terrified of them-- local
gangsters apparently.

DOUG
Shouldn't have been dealing drugs.
CLAIRE
What makes you say he was dealing
drugs?
A beat...
DOUG

What else would he be getting
robbed for? I grew up here,
believe me.

Am I right?

CLAIRE
Yeah, you’re right.

DOUG
Okay. Trust me, they had, he got

CLAIRE
He did?

DOUG
He hurt you, would have hurt you
worse- if someone hadn’t come out.
He got what he had coming. Laws of
the universe. That’s karma.

CLAIRE
I don’t think Karma works that
way.

INT. MCI CEDAR JUNCTION (WALPOLE) VISITORS AREA - DAY

Doug is opposite his FATHER (70). A shrunken man, who
wears a prison jumpsuit and sits opposite Doug.

DOUG'S FATHER
I could tell there’s something
wrong with you, what’s the fuckin’

DOUG
Yeah? I didn’t hear about it.

DOUG'S FATHER

A GUARD calls out.

GUARD

All right, Dad...

DOUG'S FATHER

DOUG'S FATHER (CONT’D)
Do you remember when your mother

There is a beat, Doug realizes his father is waiting for
an answer.

DOUG

If I think back on it.

DOUG'S FATHER
I never seen a kid cry so hard.
You started throwin’ up. I told
you if you looked hard enough she
might come back. Trying to make it
better for you. Then you turn
around and carried that like it
was your fault. It wasn’t. There’s

EXT. MISHUAM HOUSING PROJECTS ROOFTOP - SUNSET

Doug, Gloansy and Dez come up a stairwell and out onto a
rooftop, they look around, Jem is waiting for them.

GLOANSY
Do the four of us need to be
coming up here right now?

JEM
It came in.
DOUG
What came in?
JEM

Should have thought about that

Dez and Gloansy watching like a tennis match. Finally:

GLOANSY
Duggy, they were on us before this
one and we got by...

DOUG
Oh, now you, too?

JEM
We're robbin’ motherfuckers. Do
you understand that? Boostin’
people. Banks. There’s ain’t no
time out in this shit.

DOUG
Do you want to get caught? You’re

play.

JEM

She doesn’t know anything.
GLOANSY

DOUG

Listen, she doesn’t know anything,
I'm telling you straight. I’m out.
Okay. I’m done. I consider us
lucky to be where we are.

JEM
That’s not the way Fergie sees it.
DOUG
I don’t give a fuck how Fergie
sees it.
JEM

You should. He set this aside for
us and now that’s the expectation.

explained to you? It’s finished.

(was this it?)
Did you think I was gonna be with
your sister for the rest of my
life?

(deeper )
I ain’t the father, Jem, you know
that, right?

No one says anything.

DOUG (CONT’D)

I don’t know who is, but there
ain’t enough free clinics in
Matapan to find out.

Jem SWINGS AT DOUG, who is quick enough where he only
takes half the impact. He grabs Jem by the SHIRT and they
go at it, TRADING PUNCHES, vicious and quick. Gloansy
tries to break it up but has to back off.

Jem comes loose and trips, falling toward the edge of the
roof. He lands and NEARLY FALLS OVER THE EDGE. Doug comes
toward him. Jem raises his hand as if to say “enough.”

JEM
Dougie. Wait.

Doug slows. JEM SUCKER PUNCHES Doug, sending him back. He
lands on top of him, throwing more punches. Doug pulls
his shirt over his head, tying up Jem’s hands and puts
the other hand around his neck-- holding him there. Both
out of breath and bloodied.

DOUG
I’m done.

Doug gets up and heads for the stairs.

Yes, come in.

FRAWLEY

He moves past her, down the hallway into the living room.

CLAIRE

His eyes spark to a TIFFANY JEWELRY CASE on the table.
He takes out the diamond necklace like a jilted lover.

CLAIRE (CONT'D)
That -- it was a gift.

FRAWLEY

She doesn’t answer. He sets it down, exhales.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)

CLAIRE

FRAWLEY
The furniture mover.

prime suspects.

Frawley holds up the envelope.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
I came here to share that with
you. Or I can certainly leave if
that’s what you’d like.

He takes her silence as indication of consent and starts
going through the mug shots.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Alfred Macgloan...Desmond
Elden...lesser figures.

He sets those aside.
FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
James Coughlin we think assaulted

He turns the paper over, revealing JEM’S PHOTO.
FRAWLEY (CONT'D)

Fregus moves through the small shop spraying flowers. His

Doug enters and they both look up.

DOUG

Beg your pardon?

FERGIE
Nothin’ compared with what I lose
if this doesn’t get done. You’re

DOUG

Who do you think you are? The only

fucked up face who don’t know his
glory years are behind him. I
ain’t workin’ for ya.

Doug stiffens a bit.

DOUG
Don’t bring up my father.

Fergie looks at Doug, who hasn’t moved.

FERGIE (CONT’D)
All them fliers you passed out
when you were little-lookin’ for

heart to tell his son he was

Angle on Doug: impassive, dark.

Doug's heart drops. He rings her buzzer. She doesn’t
answer. He POUNDS the door. No answer.

He HURLS his body into the door- SMASHING it. It comes
partially loose.

DOUG

He KICKS the door again, twice. It SMASHES OPEN. He runs

INT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Doug comes running up the stairs, breathing heavy, slows

He moves the through the apartment with stealth.

Through the front living area, to a dining/kitchen, then
through a ‘guest/den’ and ultimately into the bedroom.

Doug Stands in the bedroom, sensing something, not sure
what it is. He moves to the bathroom, sees the door
slightly AJAR and a SHADOW on the FLOOR. He PUSHES IT
OPEN slowly.

We reveal: CLAIRE, SITTING ON THE FLOOR, she’s been

Boston? Priceless.

Rusty laughs. Fergie thinks the Mastercard joke is
funnier than hell. Doug stares. The guys gather round the
chart. We see a FENWAY PARK SEATING CHART.

EXT. THE FLORIST SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
Doug, Jem, Gloansy and Dez come out. Doug turns to Jem.

DOUG
This is going to be a
motherfucker, you know that.

JEM
If they were easy, kid, everyone
would do them.

The tension between them begins to ease.

DOUG
How long ‘till Rusty finds the
inside man after the job?

JEM
He should have picked better
horses.

INT. THE TAP —- DOWNSTAIRS - EVENING

Krista sits at the bar and we see Frawley is watching
her. He comes over and sits next to her.

FRAWLEY

Seems like we were having a bit of
a staring contest over there.

(he gets her a drink)
Funny story, one night at a bar,
this guy was going around telling
ladies he was judging a Hugging
Contest, And most of the time,
they fell for it. He would hold
them and rub their backs, I
finally got sick of it, and I told
him I was judging a Face-Punching
Contest.

KRISTA
I'd punch him myself.

He TOASTS her his Bud, then drains it.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:

FRAWLEY
Oh, by the way, I’m here tonight
judging a Fucking Contest.

She smiles, Frawley drops another twenty on the bar. The
drinks come quickly.

KRISTA
What are you doing down here?
Slumming?
FRAWLEY
Trying to do my job.
KRISTA
Oh, right. The Fucking Contest.
FRAWLEY
Basically correct. I work for the

FBI.

Krista throws her head back and laughs, warming to him.

KRISTA
That’s the first laugh I had ina
month.

FRAWLEY

You and Doug MacRay used to run
around, right?

KRISTA
How you know Duggy?

FRAWLEY
We sorta work together.

KRISTA
Demolition.

FRAWLEY
Nooooo.

He pulls out FIVE MORE TWENTIES.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
You a pretty decent judge of size?

KRISTA
Depends. Size of what?

He holds up one of the twenties.

FRAWLEY
How big would you say this is?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

94,

(2)
KRISTA
Smaller than a hundred.
FRAWLEY
Six inches? Over or under.
KRISTA
Under.
FRAWLEY

Wrong. Six point one four inches
exactly. Now the width.

Girth. Some claim it’s more
important. Give a guess.

She just looks at him.

She’s hear.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Two point six one inches. I know
everything there is to know about
money. Thickness? Point oh oh
four three inches. Not much to
excite you there. Weight? About
one gram. That makes a twenty
almost worth its weight in, say...
Oxy.

ing him now -- eyes wide open.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
So how’s it work? Bartender takes
a call, gives you an address? You
pick up a package at Point A,
deliver it to Point B, and for
that the Florist pays you a C.
(beat)
You're thinking about walking out
on me. See, it’s not that simple.
I start waving this around.
(shows badge)
.».. bad for you.

KRISTA
I want a lawyer.

FRAWLEY
Good, get one. This is about
protecting yourself. Not even
yourself. Your daughter.

KRISTA

Don’t fuckin’ talk about my
daughter.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

95.

FRAWLEY

How long were you with MacRay?
KRISTA

All my life.
FRAWLEY

And in all those years you were

together -- how many diamond

necklaces he buy you from Tiffany?

EXT. CHARLESTOWN GARDENS - DAY

Doug heads

through the nearby gardens to Claire’s plot.

There she is. Claire turns when the gate latch CLICKS,
her bare limbs glowing in the afternoon sun, she sees him

DOUG
Just let me say something.

She just looks at him.

DOUG (CONT'D)
You know who I am. You always
have.

CLAIRE
If I knew who you were I would
have called the police as soon as
I saw you in the laundromat.

DOUG
Imagine there was no robbery. Then
what? We would be the same people.

She can’t do this.

CLAIRE
You have to go away, Doug.

DOUG
If you want me to go away? All you
need to do is call the police and
tell them that we’ll be set up at
the Howard Johnson on Yawkey way
in room 224 in two days.

CLAIRE
What?

DOUG

On Monday we’re going to rob the
cash room at Fenway Park.

(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:

Now he has completely exposed himself.

DOUG (CONT’D)
So I guess I’1l either end up in
Walpole- or I'll end up with you.

CLAIRE
Why are you telling me this?
(angrier)
Why are you doing this to me?

DOUG
I’m gonna change my life, Claire.
(beat)
I want it to be with you.

A HORSE’S SNORT interrupts. A MOUNTED POLICEMAN trots on
the path toward them.

Claire’s eyes dampen, and she faces him.

CLAIRE
Doug --

He cuts her off.
DOUG

Come with me. I won’t leave you, I

won’t hurt you and I will never

lie to you again.
INT. JEM’S HOUSE - DAY
Jem is cleaning the weapons and ammunition on a table in
a basement room. Doug comes downstairs. Jem does not

immediately acknowledge him.

Doug looks at the several automatic and semi-automatic
assault weapons.

DOUG
(re: guns)
You gotta love New Hampshire.
Jem keeps cleaning.

JEM
Uniforms set?

DOUG
Yup. Vests, plates.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Jem snorts

97.

JEM
Heard you’re thinking about
leaving.

DOUG

If this goes right, might be your
time to step away, too.

JEM
What am I gonna do? Go down to
Margaritaville, drink up half a
yard, come back in five years?
(beat)
This is who we are.

DOUG
Things change, man. Nothing wrong
with it.

JEM
Depends what kind of change.

DOUG
We had a good run, Jimmy. By any
standard.

JEM

We set the standard.

DOUG
The Florist -- kid, he’ll keep
turning you out till you get
bounced for good.

JEM
Just so we're clear. We get hemmed
in tomorrow- you won’t see my
hands in the air. I expect to see
no one else’s either...

INT. HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL - ROOM 224 - AFTERNOON/NIGHT

Doug opens

a curtain revealing a view of Fenway Park.

He checks the message light on the phone, picks up the
receiver, makes sure the phone is working.

HOTEL ROOM

BATHROOM - LATER

Doug’s in the shower, standing under its heat. Thinks he
hears KNOCKING. He shuts off the water and listens.
98.

HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Wearing only a towel, Doug throws open the door. A woman
three doors down turns fast to the sound. It’s Krista,
not Claire, with Shyne’s dead weight on her hip.

Doug doesn’t move. Krista comes up, looking past him into
the room.

KRISTA
Got any juice?

She holds up Shyne’s empty bottle.

KRISTA (CONT’D)
Dez told me you were here.

DOUG
What do you want, Kris?

He throws on his pants.

KRISTA
To see you before you go.

Krista sits on the edge of the bed.

DOUG
You can’t stay.

KRISTA
I don’t want to stay. I want to
go... With you.

Doug stiffens -- looks away.

KRISTA (CONT’D)
I want to change, too, Duggy. Why
can’t I change? I could be a
different person.

(beat)
I’ve been so fucking patient all
these years -- always thinkin’ my

time was coming. My whole life- I
mean, haven’t I been loyal?

DOUG
It’s not about loyalty, Krista.

KRISTA
Tell me what it’s about, then, and
I‘1l do it. I’1l1 do whatever you
want me to do. I know you think I
can’t make you happy, but it’s not
true. I can.

(CONTINUED)
99,
CONTINUED:

Doug watches Shyne flash blue-green in the TV light,
casting a small shadow. Krista releases him, hurt.

KRISTA (CONT’D)
You can’t wait for me to go, can
you.

DOUG
I’m leaving with somebody else.

She looks around the room.

KRISTA
Why isn’t she here then, if she’s
going with you? Such a trashy
little fuck pad. After a Tiffany
necklace, I’d’ve thought a room at
the Ritz.

DOUG
What did you say? Who told you?

KRISTA
A little bird.

He grabs her, his anger eliciting a fierce smile from
her. He shakes her, but can’t shake away that smile.

KRISTA (CONT’D)
You always did like it rough.

DOUG
What do you know about a necklace?

He GRABS HER BY THE NECK AND SLAMS HER INTO THE WALL.

KRISTA
I know you’d rather see a rope
around my neck.

DOUG
It’s not a FUCKIN’ JOKE! WHO TOLD
YOU?

Doug sees Shyne in his periphery. He releases Krista and
scoops up Shyne and her doll, the child’s eyes never
leaving the TV screen.
KRISTA
Take me with you. I’1l go to hell
for you.

He marches to the door with Shyne under his arm.

(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED: (2)

Doug opens the door and sets Shyne down gently on the
hall floor. He steps back into the room, facing Krista.

KRISTA (CONT’D)
We’re coming with you.

DOUG
You're getting out of here.

He starts to resolutely move her.
KRISTA
Don’t say no to me. You better
think about what you’re doin’.

He grabs her arm. She fights him --

KRISTA (CONT'D)
No!

-- POUNDING his chest, pushing her nails into his
windpipe, Doug maneuvers her toward the door.

She shakes free of his grip and walks the few remaining
steps out into the hallway herself.

KRISTA (CONT’D)
You don’t know what you just-

Doug SLAMS the door on her, throws the lock.

He waits. Expecting banging, screaming -- but there’s
NOTHING. When he looks through the spyglass, she is gone.
EXT. BOSTON STREETS - MORNING

Rain. Frawley is crossing the street, listening to the
cell, trying to shovel eggs in his mouth and keep the

ones in the box from getting wet.

FRAWLEY
Go ahead, I can hear you.

SERGEANT (PHONE)

Agent Frawley? We got a DWI here,
one-car in the C-town Navy Yard.

EXT. CHARLESTOWN NAVY YARD - DRY DOCKS - CONTINUOUS
ACTION

Cruisers surround an accident: Doug’s Truck demolished
against an old anchor on the dry docks, hood steaming.

(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:

SERGEANT (V.O.)
Coughlin, Kristina. Had a kid
with her. Little girl’s fine, but
the mother is banged up --

INT. HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL ROOM 224 - SAME

Doug, Jem, Dez and Gloansy all prepare for the job. They
are DRESSED AS COPS and loading WEAPONS into DUFFEL bags.

Doug checks the door and cracks the blinds slightly to
look out.

JEM
Will you quit fuckin’ doin’ that.
You’re makin’ me nervous. There’s
no one at HoJo’s. Shit.

Doug ignores him and goes back to loading bags.

INT. MASS GENERAL - ER - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Frawley walks in squeaking wet shoes, showing his creds --
then walks to one of the curtained bays.

INT. ER BAY

Krista sits in the padded visitor’s chair, gauze wrapped
around her forehead, a bright red bloom over her eye.

Blood spatters her shirt and jeans.

KRISTA
Here he is. Six inches.

The SERGEANT pokes his head in, nods to Frawley, leaves.

FRAWLEY
What happened?
KRISTA
You're in the FBI. Figure it the

fuck out.

Frawley glances at the EMPTY CAR SEAT in the corner,
crumb-dusted and milk-stained. Krista sees him looking.

KRISTA (CONT'D)

No, she wasn’t hurt. Nota
scratch.

(CONTINUED)
102.

CONTINUED:
FRAWLEY
You could be looking at Mother of
the Year.
KRISTA

What do you know what I go
through? Fuckin’ Barney. I’m doin’
my best. Do you know my life?

FRAWLEY
Your daughter's in the back seat
of a state van, being driven by a
stranger to the Department of
Social Services. How long you
want to talk here?

Krista stares, eyes dampening. Frawley holds his glare.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Maybe you want a lawyer, not FBI.

She looks crestfallen as he makes to leave.
KRISTA

Why is it I’m always the one who
gets used?

FRAWLEY
You're going to need a plea
agreement -- if you want any

chance to retain custody.

She looks up fast, her eyes blinking wet.

KRISTA
I want your guarantee.
FRAWLEY
I never said guarantee.
KRISTA
You said --
FRAWLEY

I said I could try. If that’s not
enough, maybe your brother can
help. Maybe ‘Doug’ can do
something?

(smartass )
Fergie have social services juice?

Her eyes spark to the last name.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
I'm kidding.

(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED: (2)

Nothing in her low-eyed look is telling -- except its
duration.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Oh, Jesus. You and the Florist?

The list of suspects just narrowed to one.
FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
(to self)
Mercy.

Krista’s chin trembles. A hard woman crumbling is an
awful thing to watch.

KRISTA
Why you have to lean on me so
hard?
FRAWLEY
You called me. What do you have?
KRISTA
Duggy’s going away after. With

her.
Frawley is stunned. Then starts piecing it together.

FRAWLEY
Wait, what after? After what?

Krista stares at the ground. Frawley zeroes in.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
You need to be smart Krista. This
is a big moment for Shyne. This
can make the difference for her.

She looks away, her jaw quivering.

KRISTA
(breaking down)
She's retarded. She’s going to
need things. Special schools.
For her I’m doing this. It’s not
me. Not for me.

EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL ROOM 224, BALCONY - SAME

The four cops emerge with their gear. Doug looks around,
all directions. She didn’t come- but she didn’t dime.
104.

INT. THUNDERBIRD (LANDSDOWNE ST.) - NOON

Four cops sitting in a parked Thunderbird. Gloansy at the
wheel, Dez beside him, Doug and Jem in back: all wearing
COP UNIFORMS. On the RADIO, a reporter is in hysterics
over traffic tie-ups. Nervous anticipation is thick
inside the car.

WEEI RADIO
...Tie ups on the expressway, the
pike...

Doug stares out the window. He glances at his watch.

DOUG
Let's go.

EXT. THUNDERBIRD (LANDSDOWNE ST.) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The two rear doors open simultaneously as Doug and Jem

exit. Gloansy and Dez remain in the car. Doug and Jem

start toward an entrance under the green monster.

EXT. LANDSDOWNE ST. - CONTINUOUS

Steadicam, Doug and Jem through the crowd, around the

ballpark, into the entrance.

EXT./INT. LANDSDOWNE ST. ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Jem BANGS HARD ON A BANK OF EXIT ONLY DOORS. We stay with
them in STEADICAM real time.

The DOOR OPENS revealing the INSIDE MAN (55). He is the
PARK HEAD of MAINTENANCE. His Izod shirt is tucked in
over his belly. He sports a gold pinky ring and the tan
from his most recent trip to bet Jai Alai in Florida has
yet to fade.

He eyes them with deep regret, not a bad man--just a guy
with a sickness who couldn’t get out from under.

INSIDE MAN
Officer.

JEM
Yeah, let’s go.

Doug holds his look as he passes: the face of a dead man.

The Inside Man leads them through the doors and onto an
open metal staircase. They go DOWN ONE FLIGHT.

(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:

As our camera counters, we reveal an open MAINTENANCE
door the size of a truck that opens out on to LEFT FIELD
and the GREEN MONSTER SCOREBOARD. It is odd to be so
close, the field almost unnaturally green.

WORKERS mill around, no one gives them a second look.

The Inside man leads them into his office, a menagerie of
lawn tools, odds and ends-- and gestures toward a small
DOOR IN THE BACK.

They step through the door and find themselves in a
CAVERNOUS AREA UNDERNEATH THE SEATS.

The Inside man indicates that this where they’1l PART
WAYS.

Jem and Doug continue and are able to walk, unobserved
all the way around the park and into the REAR TUNNELS.
Since that would take too long to do in real time we

CUT TO:

INT. UNDERNEATH SEATS - MOMENTS LATER

Jem and Doug proceed to an UNMARKED DOOR.

They move through it. It leads into the security tunnels.
They down the tunnels.

INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE CASH ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

NOW THEY SEE THE GUARDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TUNNEL,
PREVENTING THEM FROM GETTING ANY FARTHER.

Two ARMED SECURITY PERSONNEL in blue shirts stand talking
to a YOUNGER SECURITY GUARD, ERIC in a RED SHIRT. Doug
starts at them, his voice BOOMING inside the tunnel.

DOUG
Who called 911?

The Guards peer down the long tunnel. Jem’s hand is on
his waist.

JEM
Was it you who called?

The Red Shirt (ERIC) comes hustling up -- young and
jittery.

JEM (CONT'D)
911 call we got.

(CONTINUED)
106.

CONTINUED:
ERIC
I didn’t... it wasn’t...
JEM
Robbery call. Who else is here?
ERIC
Robbery?
DOUG
Call says you're being held up.
Right now.

The concerned Guards put their hands on their holsters.
JEM
We got a distress call! Who made
the call?

The Guards step into the far end of the tunnel.

GUARD #1
No call from us.
JEM GUARD #1
(closer) (raising one hand)
Who called it? Hold on. Where’s Mike?
JEM GUARD #2
ID! Let’s see some ID! Hold on, hold it, now.

Guard #1 drops down into a protective crouch.

JEM DOUG
Whoa, whoa! Don’t do that.

Doug pushes Eric flat to the ground.

DOUG
Everybody on the ground now.
JEM DOUG
For our safety! I want IDs Get down!
from everybody.
GUARD #2
Wait, hey!
JEM

ON THE FLOOR!
Panicky Guard #1 pulls the sidearm from his holster.

DOUG
Gun! Gun!

(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED: (2)

JEM
Drop your weapon! Put it down now!

Both Doug and Jem DRAW AND AIM.

GUARD #2 JEM
We did not call! Stop resisting! Get down!

Cursing, Guard #1 yields, lying on his belly, arms out.
Jem approaches, stepping on his wrist. Guard #2 relents.

Doug hustles to Jem’s side, quickly binding their hands
with plastic ties and taking their radios.

DOUG AND JEM PULL MASKS UP FROM INSIDE THEIR COLLARS,
only their eyes are exposed.

GUARD #1
(look of terror)
I don’t want no trouble.

Doug grabs Guard #1. Checks watch, looks to Jem.

DOUG
We got fifteen minutes until they
bring the cash out of the safe and
pack it up for the truck.

Jem is staring at GUARD #1. Who is DOUBLED OVER in pain.

JEM
(to Guard #1)
Christ. Are you gonna shit?

INT. BATHROOM —- MOMENTS LATER

Doug is outside an open stall. Guard #1 has his trousers
down and hugs his bare knees. Jem at the open door.

JEM
Ho! Armed robbery enema.

INT. FENWAY PARK, OUTSIDE MONEY ROOM - 15 MIN LATER

Jem watches over Guard #1 and the others while Doug
approaches the money room, it has a steel door and
concrete walls. There is a smoked glass window. He has
Guard #1. Doug calls loudly to the security guys inside
the cash room that cannot be seen but that can hear him.

DOUG
Arnold Washton! In the cash room.

You got a wife, Linda.

DOUG (CONT'D)
You live at 311 Hazer Street,
Quincy -- with three small dogs.

Guard #1 looks surprised.
DOUG (CONT’D)
Also in the cash room: Morton
Harford, 27 Counting Lane,
Livingston Arms, Randolph -- wife
also Linda. Arnold, the Lindas
want you to open this door.
Nothing from the cash room.
DOUG (CONT’D)
(to Guard #1, quiet)
So much for marriage.
(to the door, loud)
Arnold, you will not always be
behind a steel door. We know where
you live, we will come and find
you and when we do, you will
fuckin’ hate that.

CLACK goes the cash room door, opening.

INT. CASH ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

VALHALLA --BIG BRICKS of CASH- Counting machines.
Doug and Jem pull out all the cash.

ARNOLD and MORTON are zip tied.

Jem dumps off two heavy racks of coins, the rolls
BURSTING nickels and dimes to the floor.

Jem tosses cash parcels at Doug who bags them.

MONEY LOADED on a DOLLY, they set to roll out.

Jem and Doug look at each other, loaded up with a HUGE
BAG OF MONEY.

INT. FENWAY PARK, OUTSIDE MONEY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JEM AND DOUG TAKE: TWO HOSTAGES AND A DOLLY OF MONEY
They head toward the LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

Arnold is one of those guys who starts talking when he
gets scared.

(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:

ARNOLD
Listen, no money’s worth-

DOUG
--That’s fine, Arnold. All be over
in a minute.

Long beat as they roll down the hallway.

ARNOLD
(to Doug)
That’s two million dollars right
there.
DOUG

There’s only one smart thing my
father ever told me, Arnie: anyone
can grab money. It’s the getaway--
separates the pros from the cons.

INT. TRUCK DELIVERY BAY - MOMENTS LATER
THE ARMORED TRUCK HAS ARRIVED.

There are THREE BAYS where trucks can pull in and off-
load their goods into the warehouse like room. The
armored truck is in BAY ONE.

BAYS TWO AND THREE ARE CLOSED with a metal grate.

Doug sees the driver of the armored car is a WO --
frizzy-haired, startled.

SHE SEES THEM, TOO! She fumbles the keys in the ignition,
STARTING UP THE TRUCK.

The LOCKS RESET; the rooftop BEACON SPINS. Tailpipe
COUGHS diesel smoke. But the bay door is still closed --
she’s got nowhere to go. Driver begins talking fast into
the handset of a ceiling-mounted radio.

GUARD #1
Assholes fucked up. Sandy’s locked
in there. She’s calling five-oh.
Doug produces a walkie-talkie, pressing the call button.
DOUG
(into walkie-talkie)
Did you get the tail car?

DEZ (ON RADIO)
Ready. All clear out here.

(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:

Doug hits the switch on a second bay door, which crawls
open.

Dez, in his cop slicker, enters holding his Beretta on
the bound TAIL-CAR DRIVER Black Suburban.

The Suburban then BACKS INSIDE the bay, trunk end first.
Gloansy leaps out, engine running, taking the Tail-Car
Driver from Dez and walking him over to the Guard #1.
Doug makes a remark to the tail car driver.

DOUG
Sit over here, you can go right
back to sleep.

Dez touches the radio wire looped over his ear.

DEZ
There it is. Call just went out to
PD from dispatch.

Doug nods calmly -- trotting with Dez to the idling can.

DOUG
(indicating uniform)
We got here just in time.

EXT. FENWAY PARK - GATE A - SAME TIME

Outside the “1912 Fenway Park” facade, Frawley opens his
trunk and puts on his nylon FBI vest. He pulls his
REMINGTON 870 TWELVE-GAUGE from its sleeve, Dino’s Taurus
pulls up.

DINO
I looped the block. No vans
around, nothing.

FRAWLEY
Maybe we’re too early. Too late.

A blue police CAMPER idles: the Entry and Apprehension
Team Mobile-Command Center. Two pairs of EAT COMMANDOS
emerge and approach Frawley. Frawley indicates the main
pedestrian concourse.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Guys, we have to close off these
streets.

One cop interrupts him.

(CONTINUED)
111.

TAC COP
Sir, there’s a voice inside, says
they've been robbed. We're setting
up there now.

Frawley starts running that way.

INT. LOADING DOCK - DAY

Jem and Doug load the money into the follow car. Doug
sees something shiny over Jem’s shoulder.

DOUG
Look out!

It’s a small mirror on a long pole poking through a crack
in the wall. Doug opens up, SHATTERING the mirror --
DEAFENING. The pole clatters to the floor.

The dock suddenly fills with ricocheting fireballs:
STARFLASH ROUNDS.

Jem FIRES as they take cover. Jem breaks off his empty
mag and reloads, cursing.

There is ANOTHER EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE. The HOSTAGES are
yelling and screaming. Gloansy peeks out a door.

GLOANSY
That’s the fuckin’ swat team!

JEM
(quiet)
We got dimed.

He leaps out, SPRAYING gunfire, then leans back in again.

THREE GUNSHOTS CRACK from a different direction. Dez’s
knee explodes and he SHRIEKS in agony -- twisting and
falling.

Doug rushes to him, dragging Dez to the rear tire of the
can. Hostages are YELLING.

Doug searches for the source of the gunshots. Dez, white
as a ghost -- his knee blown off -- sits in a widening
pool of his own blood. Then -- MORE SHOTS, over their
heads.

Jem ADVANCES, FIRING on a SOURCE OF FIRE and BACKS OFF

some of the EAT guys. His .762 Rounds BLOW OFF PIECES OF
EAT SHIELDS.

(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:

Doug HOLLERS, but then sees: The shots are coming from
the gun ports INSIDE the truck. The Driver has them
pinned down.

Ducking low, Doug sees Gloansy’s feet on the other side
of the can’s wheelbase. He YELLS his name, but Gloansy
can’t hear him. He rips off his walkie-talkie and slides
it under the truck, striking him in the shoe.

DOUG
(to Gloansy)
The door! Open the door!

Gloansy crawls and HITS the plunger -- the bay door
RISING.

JEM
What are you doing?

But Doug was right: the driver PANICS, jumping into the
front seat and POWERING FORWARD, SCRAPING the can against
the brick door frame, lurching out onto Van Ness.

EXT. GATE D - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Frawley watching as the Provident truck comes out, beacon
twirling, SURGING toward him. Other cops rush up, FIRING -
- wasting rounds against the grill and windshield.

The truck SKIDS on the wet road, then over-corrects,
veering toward the sidewalk on Yawkey -- and RAMMING THE
MOBILE COMMAND UNIT HEAD-ON.

The blow is TREMENDOUS: the camper BUCKLING AND GRINDING
on its rims, tearing up asphalt and uprooting ornamental
trees. Cops tumble out of the open end, hurt and
crawling away.

INT. LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Now that the full tactical team is assembled AND they
know there are armed men firing at them from inside, the
firing becomes a continuous assault.

Jem and Doug are firing back but they recognize that
ultimately they are going to be overwhelmed. There will
be improvised dialogue to this effect and a lot of
shooting from inside the loading dock back out to the
tactical guys, with Jem’s rounds being the only thing
that keep them at bay.

Gloansy darts to the can and lifts Dez over his shoulder -
- Jem emptying another magazine as cover.

(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:

Gloansy throws Dez into the Suburban, SLAMS THE TRUNK
SHUT, and climbs inside.

GLOANSY
Meet you at the switch!

Gloansy gets their attention-

GLOANSY (CONT’D)

I’m gettin’ seven to ten.

(to Doug)
You’re ten to twenty.

(to Jem)
And you’re done.

(beat)
They’1l be all over me, they won't
know there's more people in here.
You two go back out through the
park.

(he smiles)
Meet me at the switch.

This self sacrifice is acknowledged by shared looks-
broken off quickly as gunfire comes through the door.

Gloansy heads for the follow car.

Doug turns and runs the length of the cave, hitting
buttons on every bay door -- all of them rising.

EXT. GATE D - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Black Suburban shoots out of the second bay door. It
starts in the opposite direction of the ARMORED CAR, but
APPROACHING CRUISERS make it cut back in a controlled
skid, racing toward Frawley.

Frawley works the pump action on his shotgun: BLAM! --
MISSES the first shot, sparks kicking up off the asphalt.
He jumps the curb, careening into the parked Thunderbird.
Several other OFFICERS FIRE. GLOANSY JERKS HARD to the
RIGHT and then has to OVER CORRECT.

INT. AMBULANCE BAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

SOUND OF GUNFIRE AND A CRASH FROM OUTSIDE

One empty duffel remains on the floor by the cart. Jem
moves to it, STUFFING IT WITH CASH.

JEM
Fuckin’ Gloansy...

(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:

DOUG
The fuck are you doing? Leave it!

JEM
How the fuck did this happen?

Jem raises the Tec-9. Doug backs off. Jem can taste his
guilt.

JEM (CONT'D)
Did you do this?

Jem staring at Doug -- holding the gun on him.

JEM (CONT'D)
Why?

More SIRENS.-- His eyes and gun never leaving Doug.

Doug OPENS HIS ARMS, awaiting Jem’s bullet.

Jem stares at him until...his gun comes down. Jem hefts
the bag and turns and exits back into the park.

EXT. YAWKEY WAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

SIRENS AND FLASHING BLUES arrive. In the Suburban,
Gloansy is slumped against the blood-streaked window and
deployed airbag, unmoving. Dez crumpled to the floor of
the passenger seat.

The place is SWARMING WITH OFFICERS.

Frawley is down on his haunches behind a patrol car, his
shotgun on his knees, which are bobbing and jumping with

adrenaline.

Frawley rises, searching for Dino among the crowd of cops
and umbrellas -- finding him talking to a POLICE CAPTAIN.

FRAWLEY
Where'd the patrol cars come from?

POLICE CAPTAIN
We got a 911. Distress call from
inside the armored.

Frawley looks at the armored truck at the camper wreck.

FRAWLEY
Dean, these guys... they go around
alarms.
(thinking)

They wanted the call to go out.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:

DINO
What?

He looks back up Van Ness: a sea of cops.
FRAWLEY
They wanted police here.
INT. GRANDSTANDS CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Doug moves back through the tunnel. He opens a door the
leads him onto a MAIN CONCOURSE.

He walks up some stairs and out a SIDE DOOR.

EXT. YAWKEY WAY - MOMENTS LATER

Frawley is trolling slowly and sees ONE OFFICER off in
the MIDDLE DISTANCE who doesn’t appear to be engaged.

FRAWLEY
Him. Follow him.

EXT. VAN NESS —- CONTINUOUS ACTION

Doug crosses the street briskly. Painful glances at the
smashed Suburban at the far end of the street.

Then, ahead of him, he sees Jem with his duffel -- a man
in an FBI vest (Frawley) trailing him. Doug looks at
freedom--looks back and follows Jem.

EXT. IPSWICH STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Frawley following Jem along a row of parked cars.

FRAWLEY
Officer! Hold up a minute there,
please.

Jem stops, motionless. When he turns, he turns firing his
shoulder-harnessed Tec with a sweeping arm motion.

Two cops drop a sawhorse and run. Frawley spins away--
just in time. Jem FIRES. BYSTANDERS scatter.

Jem methodically comes after Frawley, who scrambles back
on his haunches. He is shooting to kill Frawley rather
than escape and if he hadn’t run out of ammunition-he
would have.
116.

ON DOUG
Two other Cops run past, one YELLING to Doug:
COP
Take the left flank! We’re gonna
sweep up Boylston!

He sees Jem break across the street, bag in one hand, Tec-
9 in the other. Frawley stalking Jem with a shotgun.

Jem heads for a crowded McDonald's, a panicked, grainy
voice SCREAMING at him on the Drive-Thru speaker.

ON FRAWLEY

Shotgun to his shoulder. He FIRES WIDE, hitting a stand
of free Apartment Guides in front of Jem, stopping him
and keeping him away from the McDonald's.

Jem cuts back the other way as people stream out of
McDonald's. People are running in all directions.

ON DOUG

Seeing Frawley, panicked, looking almost childlike trying
to pick up and load dirty shells from the gutter. Doug
lines up A PERFECT SHOT AT FRAWLEY...

Doug tenses, waiting -- but does not take the shot.

ON JEM

Holding the money bag as a shield now, he crosses the
intersection, where MORE COPS lie in wait. A FLURRY of
rounds peck at his vest, his leg, his shooting arm.

Jem spits rounds back. He staggers up the ramp to an Osco
Drug, arriving just as a Clerk inside locks the door. Jem
stutters GUNFIRE, SHATTERING the glass -- until his Tec
runs out of ammo. He throws it to the ground.

He produces a Beretta and CONTINUES FIRING.

Frawley returns fire, hitting JEM in the HAND.

FRAWLEY
On the ground, FBI. FBI!

Jem raises his extra pistol in his bloody hand. Frawley
squeezes one blast low -- BLAM! - and one high.

(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED:

JEM FALLS BACK, backpedaling until finally he falls off
the wet curb and drops hard onto the road, back against a
MAILBOX.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Coughlin! Throw me your weapon.

Doug looks back at him. A sea of police officers,
skulking behind cars, holding weapons. Bouncing brass,
glass and distant sirens are the only sounds.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
Coughlin!

JEM
All right!

Jem sees a DISCARDED MCDONALDS SODA, dropped in the
panic.

JEM (CONT'D)
One second!

He strains to reach for it and finally grasping it, he
takes a pull from the straw, quenching some deep thirst.
Closes his eyes, he puts the GUN UNDER HIS CHIN AND
FIRES.

The Police now enjoy a burst of courage and begin FIRING.

DOUG'S POV: Jem lying in the middle of the road, cops
firing. Torn cash blowing everywhere.

Doug stares out at his friend -- his brother -- dead in
the streets.

Something washes over Doug. He looks at the Beretta in
his hand -- then holsters it, as he walks away.
EXT. MAIN STREET (CHARLESTOWN) - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

Doug walking almost in a trance, kids staring up at the
beat cop. He sees nothing.

It starts to rain.

EXT. TOWN FLOWERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Doug stops, looking at the storefront window with hatred.
118.

INT. TOWN FLOWERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The bell RINGS over the door as he enters. Doug waits a
few airless moments -- Another funeral arrangement lies
in the shop--like the one for Claire.

-- until Rusty pushes through the black curtain behind
the counter. He looks up eyeing the cop like any
customer. Then he recognizes Doug’s face. Doug indicates
that Rusty should come, in a hushed, secretive manner.

DOUG
Is Fergie here? Something
happened.

Rusty comes to the counter and the second he turns his
head, Doug puts a GUN to it and PULLS THE TRIGGER,
killing him instantly.

INT. FLORIST’S BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The back room is empty.

Doug enters, comes to the center of the room. He sees a
SMALL DOOR, slightly open, lifts his gun.

DOUG
(calling out)
Fergie, come on out.

The door opens and Fergie comes through in his
sweatpants, holding a BOSTON HERALD in one hand and a .45
in the other he stands seven or eight feet from Doug.

FERGIE
Prick.

They start SHOOTING at one another.

Rather than sexing it up-- the feel should be of watching
people shoot one another on surveillance video: wide,
detached and oddly pedestrian.

Doug has the clear advantage of a VEST and after five or
six shots Fergie BUCKLES and DROPS to the floor abruptly.

Doug walks over to him, unsteady, now realizing he has
been hit once or twice himself. He replaces his empty
clip with a new one, chambering a round.

He kneels next to Fergie who lies on the floor (now we

see blood coming from Doug’s neck) and puts his gun in
the florist’s CROTCH.

(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED:

DOUG
Fergie, remember who clipped your
nuts for you-

BOOM-—

EXT. YAWKEY AND BOYLSTON INTERSECTION - TEN MINUTES LATER

Frawley listens to a COP give his SHOOTING STATEMENT to
an INTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER, exaggerating his role.

COP
At that time, I believe the
suspect was holding the weapon
like so-
Shows a gun held in front of the chest pointing skyward.
COP (CONT'D)
To reload, at which point I fired,
struck the suspect. I believe at
least once in the clavicle...
Frawley tunes this guy out

Then a flurry of activity among the cops nearby. A
passing cop’s police radio drones:

POLICE RADIO (V.O.)
«+. repeat, all units, 529 Main
Street, Charlestown...

Dino and Frawley look at each other.

FRAWLEY
That’s the Florist.

Dino hails a passing plainclothes DETECTIVE he knows.

DINO
Hey! Bobby!

DETECTIVE
Looks like somebody got Fergie.

Frawley steps forward into the rain.

FRAWLEY
Jesus Christ, that must be MacRay.

DINO
Slow down, Frawl.

(CONTINUED)
120.
CONTINUED:

FRAWLEY
(moving)
Claire Keesey.

INT./EXT. CLAIRE’S CONDO - ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER

Doorbell RINGS. Through the door glass, Claire sees the
outline of a policeman. She cautiously opens her door.

The cop raises his head. Claire sees Doug’s face -- and
the dirty, bloody hand at his neck.

Her hand goes to her mouth, eyes wide.

INT. CLAIRE’S CONDO - MOMENTS LATER

Doug is LOWERED slowly onto the floor, then we see he is
resting on her leg- she is holding him there, trying to
be careful with him.

He is dying.

Doug looks up at Claire, consciousness starting to come
and go

DOUG
Its okay.

She is holding his hand, trying to keep pressure on his
neck.

CLAIRE
I’m gonna call an ambulance, Doug.

DOUG
(seems distant)
No, stay here.

Frawley arrives at the open door. Seeing the blood trail
on the floor, he draws his SIG-Sauer and moves inside --

-- finding Claire kneeling beside a dying Doug MacRay.

Frawley comes up on the other side -- tugging the Beretta
from Doug’s holster. Doug just watches him take it.

CLAIRE
(seeing Frawley)
GET AN AMBULANCE!

Frawley finds and grabs a telephone.

(CONTINUED)
121.
CONTINUED:

FRAWLEY
They're on their way, Claire.

CLAIRE
(at Frawley, crying)
Did you do this?

He sighs, why is he always the bad guy? Shakes his head,
‘no.’

DOUG
(to Frawley)
She dimed me?

FRAWLEY
That’s right.

The feeling this gives Doug is worse than dying.

DOUG
Why’nt you take us at the hotel?

Frawley looks at Doug and Claire, confused.

FRAWLEY
You're talking about Coughlin’s
sister, right?

Doug’s eyes fix on Frawley, then he nods. Something seems
to have come free from its moorings in him.

FRAWLEY (CONT'D)

You got the Florist, huh?
(beat)

Rusty, too?

The smallest of smiles- mostly in his eyes. His pupils
start to PIN.

DOUG
(looking at Claire)
I’m sorry.

MUSIC CUE
She eases Doug’s head into her lap, and begins stroking

his hair as though comforting him to sleep. She sees his
hands are covered in dirt, as if he’d been digging. She

studies him -- as he studied her when she was
blindfolded. For a passing moment, she is overwhelmed
with grief. Then -- as if responding to some inner voice

-- she straightens her back, composing herself.

(CONTINUED)
122.
CONTINUED: (2)

CLAIRE
Shhh. Walk to the water. Until
you can feel it on your toes.

Doug’s eyes fix on something in the distance -- she rocks
him a little, slowly enough that we see just the smallest
movement in the frame to match our

CUT TO:

MOVEMENT INSIDE A CAR. THAT SAME RHYTHMIC MOTION

We're tight on something, not clear what it is, light is
flaring and something is moving. We realize now we are in
CLAIRE’S P.O.V. IN HER BLINDFOLD.

INT. MINIVAN - FLASHBACK

Doug is riding next to Claire in the back of the minivan.
Gloansey is driving and Jem rides shotgun. Claire’s blind
fold is wrapped tight around her face. She is silent.
Doug is pressed close to her.

Doug looks out the window and sees the BEACH as they
approach. He whispers in her ear so that no one else can
hear.

DOUG
I know you’re scared. It’s almost
over. You're gonna to be fine.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Claire has been released from the car but still wears her
blindfold. She walks forward on the beach toward the
water nervously, unable to see where she’s going. Over
this we hear the words Doug has just spoken to her.

DOUG (0.S.)

Don’t be afraid. Just walk to the
water. Until you can feel it on
your toes.

Her toes touch the water. She pulls at the blindfold,
yanking it loose.

Looking up she sees a giant AIRLINER FLYING OVERHEAD as
it TAKES OFF.

Black.
