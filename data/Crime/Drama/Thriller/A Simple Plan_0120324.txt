BEGIN CREDITS
INT. FEED MILL - DAY

The air is thick with dust. Grain is being milled, a loud,
steady GRINDING: WE SEE the machinery moving in the shifting
light. Shelves line one wall, sagging with burlap sacks. HANK
MITCHELL is tallying the bags on a Clipboard. He's thirty years
old, slim, light~haired, dressed in khakis and a sweater.

EXT. FEED MILL - DAY

A tall narrow building, roofed with corrugated tin. It's
separated from the feedstore by a barren, snow-covered yard.
The snow is dirty, pockmarked with tracks. We still HEAR the
grinding, but it's more muffled now.

The mill's door opens, and Hank emerges, clutching his
Glipboard. He coughs, spits into the snow, then picks his way
quickly toward the feedstore, slapping at his sweater and pants
as he goes, leaving a cloud of dust in the air behind hin.

INT. HANK'S OFFICE = DAY

A tiny office, which Hank shares with his boss, TOM BUTLER. The
bookshelves are crowded with files; the desks are messy; a
fluorescent light flickers on the ceiling. Butler, a heavyset
man approaching forty, is talking on the phone: no words, just
an intermittent string of HMMM‘'s, UH-HUH's, and UNE-UNH's.

Hank enters, plucks the top sheet of paper from his clipboard,
deposits it on Butler's desk. Butler scans its columns without
pausing in his conversation. As Hank sits down at his own,
slightly smaller desk, his watch BEEPS. He fumbles with it,
checking the time: it's noon.

Hank hurriedly shuts his briefcase, turns off his desk lamp.
When he steps to the door and pulls down his coat, Butler
glances at his own watch, raising his eyebrows, the phone still
pressed to his ear. Hank hesitates, halfway into his overcoat.

HANK
The cemetery..?
(Butler's face remains blank)
My brother and I...

Butler nods, suddenly remembering, and waves Hank away. Hank
rushes out the door. It SLAMS shut, then immediately pops back
open as Hank sticks his head in.

HANK (cont'd)
Happy New Year!

CONTINUED:

Before Butler can respond, the door shuts, and Hank is gone.
EXT. SMALL TOWN MAIN ST. - DAY

A small, worn-looking town. The street is lined with two-story
buildings, their paint peeling, gutters sagging. The few people
out and about are dressed heavily against the cold. Snow has
been shoveled into long piles along the sidewalk's edge. Wind-
tattered Christmas decorations cling to the light poles.

Hank emerges from the feedstore, buttoning his overcoat. He
turns to the right, hurrying, his head ducked against the cold.

MOVING

We follow Hank down the block. He passes a woman carrying a
bulging grocery bag, a SMALL CHILD trailing behind her,
androgynous in its snow gear. The woman's name is LINDA.
~ BANK
Happy New Year, Lindal
(to the child)
Happy New Year, Marcil

The mother and daughter both RESPOND, their faces too muffled by
their scarves for us to make out their words.

HANK walks on, passing a tavern, several stores, the library:
all of the buildings look equally rundown. Only the town hall
stands out in any way, a red-brick structure with a police truck
parked on the street before it. CARL JENKINS, the town
policeman, a white-haired, vigorous-looking old man, is scraping
the truck's windshield. He waves at Hank.

CARL
Happy New Year, Hank!

As Hank waves back, a little girl glides toward him down the
sidewalk, perched on a sled: silent, almost magical. Hank
steps aside to let her pass. Then he turns the corner, starts
down the next block. He stops at--

THE MITCHELL HOUSE

--which is just a bit less dilapidated than its neighbors, an
essentially rundown building with a thin facade of renovation:
fresh paint, clean windows, a wreath on the door. Christmas
lights blink on the porch railings. Hank climbs the steps,
vanishes inside, the door SLAMMING shut behind him.

END CREDITS
INT. MITCHELL ENTRANCEWAY —- DAY

Hank pauses inside the door, unbuttoning his coat. To his right
is the dining room, to his left the living room. Nothing's
expensive, but all the furnishings have obviously been chosen
with care. A poinsettia sits on a table by the front door.

Hank drapes his coat over the bannister, bends to remove his
shoes, then stops, listening. WE HEAR water running, and--too
faintly to make out the words--a woman singing. Hank yanks off
his shoes, starts quickly up the stairs.

INT. MITCHELL BEDROOM —- DAY

A bed, night tables, a pair of bureaus. Photographs dot the
walls; the windows look out onto the street. A door, cracked
open, leads to a bathroom. This is where the water's coming
from: Hank's wife, SARAH, is singing in the shower. We can
HEAR her words now. She's singing, "In the Bleak Midwinter".

Hank enters, moves to the bathroom door. Very slowly, he pushes
it open, steps into--

THE MITCHELL BATHROOM

A sink, toilet and tub. Everything shines whitely, except for
the shower curtain, which is bright red. Behind it, Sarah
continues to SING, her voice hauntingly pretty. Hank stands in
the center of the room, perfectly silent, listening.

After a few beats, the singing stops and the water is turned
off. Then the shower curtain is slowly pulled open, revealing--

SARAH

--who, like her voice, is hauntingly pretty. She flinches at
the sight of Hank, startled, hiding behind the shower curtain.
It clings to her body, betraying the huge dome of her belly:
she's extremely pregnant. After a moment, she smiles, and Hank
grabs a towel, steps forward with it, holding it out to her.
Neither of them says a word.

INT. MITCHELL BEDROOM = DAY

Hank is knotting his tie in front of the mirror; he's changed
into a dark suit. Sarah stands behind him, adjusting his
collar, HUMMING the Christmas carol. She's wearing a bathrobe;
her hair is still wet. She brushes at Hank's jacket.

From downstairs, WE HEAR a sudden pounding. Sarah steps to the
window, peers out.

(CONTINUED )
9 CONTINUED: 9

SARAH
Oh-oh. Looks like it's going to be a long
afternoon for you.
(grinning from the window)
Be brought Lou along.

Hank turns from the mirror in dismay, his shoulders sagging.

18 INT. MITCHELL FRONT ENTRANCEWAY - DAY 18
The POUNDING resumes, as Hank comes down the stairs. He grabs
his coat off the bannister, pulls open the door. His brother,
JACOB, waits on the porch. He's heavy, slovenly, dressed ina
dirty red parka. He eyes Hank, taking in his suit and tie.

JACOB
You ready?

Hank stares past him, buttoning his overcoat.
19h HANK'S POV — THE STREET 108
Jacob's rusted red pickup idles at the curb. His DOG, a
shepherd mix, is in the back. LOU sits in the passenger seat:
fortyish, balding, stoop-shouldered. He throws Hank a wave.
1@cont BACK TO SCENE 1@cont
Hank waves back with an obvious lack of enthusiasm.
HANK
(to Jacob)
What's he doing here?
Jacob shrugs, not looking at his brother.
JACOB
Needed a lift home.
HANK
Kind of out of the way, isn't it?
, JACOB
(another shrug)
I thought we could take him after.
Hank looks as if he's about to protest more strongly, but then

he checks himself. He sighs, reaches back inside for the
poinsettia, then shuts the door and leads Jacob down the steps.
"1

EXT. COUNTRY CEMETERY - DAY W

A small graveyard behind a ramshackle church, surrounded by open
fields. Snow covers everything. Jacob's truck idles in the
church's lot. His dog sits in back, pressed against the rear
windshield, which has been replaced with a sheet of plastic.

Hank and Jacob trudge toward the center of the cemetery. Hank
is carrying the poinsettia. They stop before a gravestone.
Jacob stoops to wipe it clear of snow, revealing an inscription:

Jacob Hansel Mitchell Josephine McDonnell Mitchell
June 2, 1930 May 5, 1933
December 31, 1990 December 31, 1990

Beneath this are two blank spots, for Hank and Jacob. The men
stand for a beat, heads bowed. The dog watches from the rear of
the truck, ears erect.

After a moment, Hank kneels to place the poinsettia before the
grave. He scoops out a little crevice for it in the snow,
inadvertently excavating the frozen remains of a potted
chrysanthemum. Hank stares at it in surprise, then up at Jacob.
HANK
Somebody else was here.

JACOB
I brought it.

Bank seems to have trouble accepting this idea.

HANK
When?

JACOB
(laughing)
You think this is the only day we can come?

Before Hank can respond, WE HEAR a screeching sound from the
parking lot. Both men turn to look.

HANK'S POV - CHURCH PARKING LOT

Lou has climbed out of the truck. He unzips his pants, starts
to pee. As he urinates, he shuffles slowly to the right.

Lou
Bey, Jake! I'm writing my name!

BACK TO SCENE

Jacob laughs. He starts toward the lot, unzipping his own fly.
Hank remains crouched there, watching as the two men, giggling
like boys, pee their names in the snow. The dog jumps from the
truck to sniff at their urine. :

EXT. PEDERSON BARNYARD - DAY *11A

The explosive sound of FLAPPING WINGS. WE SEE a chicken coop,
surrounded by a wooden fence. The chickens are scrambling, a
FOX in their midst. The fox lunges, catches one of the birds,
snaps its neck with one quick shake of the head, then darts
away, scampering over the wooden fence. The windows of the
Pederson house are blank: no one's home.

WE RISE into the air, watching the fox set off into the fields,
its paws throwing up a wake of snow. On the horizon, WE SEE a
dark mass of trees. The fox is heading straight for them.

EXT. COUNTRY CEMETERY - DAY *11B

Jacob's truck is pulling away from the parking lot, the dog in
back. WE SEE the two men's names yellowing the snow. Lou's is
written in large, bold letters. Jacob's starts out equally big,
but then gradually shrinks as his bladder empties: JAcob.

EXT. JACOB’S TRUCK ~ DAY - MOVING/BRIDGE & CREEK *1IC

The truck crosses a low bridge over a half-frozen creek. Plowed
snow is piled thickly over the bridge's railings. In the
truck's rear, the dog sits pressed against the back of the cab.

LOU (OS)
So the cop starts to search the car, right?

INT. JACOB'S TRUCK - DAY - MOVING/BESIDE FROZEN LAKE *110

Jacob drives with his gut pressed against the wheel. Like Lou,
he has a beer can nestled between his thighs. Lou is on the
outside, with Hank in the middle. Lou and Jacob talk back and
forth above Hank's head, as if he weren’t even there.

Lou
And when he looks under the seat, he
shouts: “What the hell is this supposed to
be?” And you know what the guy says?

JACOB
(snickering)
It’s a crockpot.

Lou shakes his head, LAUGHING.

He says, “Moooo.”

They both LAUGH. Hank glances from one to the other, mystified.
Lou
No. He says, “Why, officer. It’s just a
piiiiiineapple.”
They LAUGH even harder; Lou prods Hank with his elbow.

LOU (cont'd)
Get it?

Hank shakes his head. Lou turns to Jacob.

LOU (cont’d)
Mr. Accountant doesn’t get it.

Jacob starts to respond, but then a startled, panicky expression
sweeps across his face. He slams the brakes.

HANK'S POV - OUT THE WINDSHIELD 15

The fox is sprinting across the road, directly in front of us, a
chicken hanging from its jaws.

EXT. EDGE OF PARK - DAY

The truck goes into a skid, its right front tire dropping into
the ditch beside the road, the right headlight shattering.

INSIDE THE TRUCK

Everyone's thrown forward. The dog comes flying in through the
plastic rear window, legs flailing, then scrambles quickly out.

OUTSIDE THE TRUCK 16
The dog leaps down, BARKING, and chases the fox into the woods.

Jacob slaps the steering wheel with his hand.

Lou GIGGLES, and pushes open his door.

EDGE OF THE PARK

The three men climb out to inspect the damage. WE SEE their
breath in the air. Jacob flips up his parka's hood; Lou pulis
on a hat. Hank shivers in his overcoat. The dog’s BARKING
grows fainter and fainter. Jacob WHISTLES.

JACOB
MARY BETH!

Lou peers across the road. Hank follows his gaze.
ACROSS THE ROAD - HANK'S POV

The fox’'s tracks trail off across the field, a dotted line
pointed toward the Pederson farm.

BACK TO SCENE
Lou
Looks like Dwight Pederson's missing a
chicken.

Jacob WHISTLES again. The BARKING sounds very far away now, but
it seems to have stopped moving. The three men listen.

JACOB
She treed it.

LOU
That‘s how it sounds.

Jacob walks to the truck and reaches inside, rummaging behind
the front seat. He emerges with a hunting rifle in his hand.

HANK
What’re you doing?

Jacob doesn’t answer. He loads a bullet into the gun, slams the
truck's door, shoulders the rifle. .

HANK (cont’d)
It’s a nature preserve, Jacob.

JACOB
So?"

HANK
It’s posted land. You can’t hunt here.

Lou grins, watching the brothers. Jacob points at his truck.

CONTINUED: (2) 17

JACOB
He busted my headlight.

LOU
We're not really hunting here, Hank. It's
more like we're collecting a debt.

Jacob and Lou set off into the woods, LAUGHING. It's clear that
they're a bit loaded. Hank hesitates, then hurries after them.

EXT. WOODS - DAY 1B
A small stream. WE SEE the dog and fox's tracks running up the
far bank. Lou has already crossed; Jacob is Sloshing through.
Bank, in dress shoes, searches for a dry passage. Lou and Jacob
LAUGH as they watch him teeter his way across on some stones.

EXT. WOODS - FURTHER IN - DAY 19
Lou and Hank stop to rest on the edge of a small valley. Jacob
has fallen behind. He struggles toward them, his jacket open,

his face shiny with sweat. Lou points into the valley.

Lou :
Jesus. Look at all those birds.

HANK'S POV - DOWN THE SLOPE

The trees are different here: smaller, planted in rows, the
remains of an apple orchard. Their branches are full of crows.
The fox's tracks go straight through the orchard, disappearing
over the far slope. In the distance, the dog continues to BARK.

JACOB (OS)
Wish we'd brought something to drink.

BACK TO SCENE

Jacob has reached them, GASPING, soaked with sweat. Lou waves
his hand in the air, snaps his fingers over his jacket pocket,
pulls out a can of beer. He opens it, hands it to Jacob.

Lou
Always be prepared.

Jacob takes two large gulps, returns the can to Lou. Lou sips
at it, then holds it out to Hank, but Hank shakes his head.

LOU (cont’d) .
What? Can't drink till after five?

Hank SIGHS, peers off into the orchard, pointedly ignoring Lou.

LOU (cont'd)
(trying to get a rise)
Or maybe you don't wanna share? ‘Fraid
you'll catch something from us.

He winks at Jacob, who smirks. When Hank still refuses to
react, Lou hands the beer can to Jacob, scoops up a snowball.
He feints a throw at Hank, and Hank ducks. Lou and Jacob LAUGH.

Lou
See, now that's what you might call in-sin-
uea-ting a throw. Remember? You said that
last time I saw you. Could've just said
"hint," but nooo, you had to put on airs,
show us all the fancy words you know.

Lou tosses the snowball into the orchard.
BANK’S POV - THE ORCHARD

The snowball arcs into the orchard, smacks into a mound of snow
upon which a dozen crows are perched. CAWING, the crows rise
up, and a sheet of snow slides off the mound, partially
REVEALING a SINGLE ENGINE PLANE. Both its wings are missing.
It's balanced, nose-down, over the trunk of a fallen tree,

BACK TO SCENE
The three men stare into the orchard, stunned.

HANK
Jesus Christ.

INT. PLANE - DAY 26

Near darkness--we shouldn't be sure where we are. A thin stream
of light enters from a crescent-shaped tear in the fuselage. WE
HEAR muffled voices, then the cabin begins to shake. There's a

CREAKING sound, metal pushing against metal, and a perpendicular
crack appears in the darkness, a doorway opening.

WE SEE Hank’s face shoved through the crack, blinking.

INT. PLANE ~ HANK'S POV FROM THE DOORWAY - DAY

The plane’s rear is lost in shadow, but it looks empty. Toward
the front is a large duffel bag. Beyond it are two seats. in

the gray light filtering in through the ice-covered windshield,
it's impossible to tell if they're occupied.

2i EXT. ORCHARD - DAY 21

Hank pulls his head from the doorway. Jacob has his rifle
cradled in his arms; Lou is drinking from his can of beer.

HANK
I can't see.
(to Jacob)
Can you scrape some of that snow off the
windshield?

Jacob shuffles off, while Hank tugs again at the door. He pulls
so hard that he rocks the plane, dislodging the remainder of its
shell of snow, but the door refuses to budge any further,

Hank turns sideways, pushes his head and shoulders through the
doorway, then gets stuck. He tries to pull back, but his coat
is snagged. WE HEAR a tearing sound.

‘HANK (cont'd)
Shit.

22 INT. PLANE - DAY . 22

Hank is trying to worm his way in, when WE HEAR Jacob start to
Scrape at the windshield. Sank squints toward the cockpit.

Jacob continues to scrape at the windshield, but to no effect.
Through the gray opacity of the ice, WE SEE the shadow of his
arm moving back and forth. It disappears, then comes THUMPING
down against the glass. The ice shatters, falls away. Light
floods in, REVEALING a man's body, slumped in the lefthand seat.

The pilot's head, resting against the dashboard, seems to be
shaking back and forth.

Jacob shuffles back toward Lou from the front of the plane.

JACOB
What'd he say?

Lou shrugs: he neither knows nor cares. He finishes his beer,
tosses the can off into the trees, then steps behind Hank.
Watch this.

He begins to tickle Hank. Hank kicks out, but misses and loses
his footing. ‘The doorway’s grip holds him up. Lou LAUGHS.

24 INT. PLANE 24
Hank strains to get free. Lou and Jacob’s LAUGHTER filters in.

JACOB (05)

Hank freezes as WE HEAR a loud flapping sound from the cockpit.

The pilot's head is tossed aside as two crows burst from his
lap, THUDDING into the windshield. They beat against the glass,

the other on the seat beside it. Their heads dart back and
forth, eyeing Hank.

pitches forward, and finally breaks free, landing inside the

its way out, followed almost immediately by its partner.

The birds emerge from the hole. Lou flinches at the sight of
them, stumbling backward, falling onto his rear end in the snow.

Jacob fills the doorway, blocking the light.

JACOB
You see those birds?

Hank doesn’t answer. His forehead is bleeding. He stands up,
moves hurriedly toward the cockpit.

The pilot is a thin young man, dressed in a flannel shirt and
jeans. WE SEE Hank's hand tap him on the shoulder.

Hank stumbles backward, trips over the duffel bag, falls. His °-

impact upsets the plane's balance across the fallen tree: its

nose lifts into the air, and Hank slides toward the plane’s

tail. The pilot's body swivels in its chair, as if to pursue

him; the duffel bag slips along the floor till it's blocking the

doorway; and a soda can rolls ont from under the pilot's seat,

RATTLES down the length of the plane, thumps into Hank's leg.

fingers, Finally, he rises, struggles toward the door, shoving
the duffel bag out before him.

27 EXT. ORCHARD - MOMENTS LATER 27

Hank crouches beside the plane, holding snow to his wound. Lou
removes his gloves, starts to work at the duffel bag's knot,

JACOB
I say we just stop by the police station.
If we call it in on the CB, we'll never
out of here. We'll have to wait forever——

Lou has managed to open the bag; WE SEE him look inside with an
expression of stunned amazement. He reaches in, touches
whatever's there. Neither Hank nor Jacob notices his reaction.

HANK
We'll still have to come back, Jacob.
We'll have to lead them to the--

LOU
Jacob!
(Jacob turns)
Look...

He tilts the bag. It’s filled with hundred dollar bills,
packets held together with pai bands. The three men stand in
shocked silence, not even n cing when the dog reappears,
wading down through the snow on the opposite slope. Finally,
Lou starts to GIGGLE. He bends his head into the bag, kisses
the money, then looks up at the other two, ecstatic.

LOU (cont ’d)
Can you believe this?

Hank steps forward to look more closely. Jacob glances from him
to Lou, bewildered.

JACOB
It's real?
LOU
Of course it's real. Don't be stupid.

He plucks out a packet, tosses it to Jacob. Jacob catches it,
staring in wonder. Lou jumps up, pumped with excitement.

Stay the hell out of it, then. We don't

HANK
I don't want to stump you with another
"fancy" word, but does the term accomplice
mean anything to you?

Jacob tries to intercede before Lou can reply.

Hank is

JACOB
Why would we get caught?

HANK
It's a lot of money, Jacob. Someone has to
be looking for it. And when they find the
plane, and it's not inside-~

LOU
That's bullshit. That guy's gotta be a
drug dealer or something. As far as the
police're concerned this doesn't even
exist. Nobody knows about it but us.

JACOB
(nodding enthusiastically)
Like lost treasure!

obviously unconvinced. Lou turns to Jacob, disgusted.

Lou
Your fucking brother--it's the American
dream, and he just wants to walk away from
it.

HANK
You work for the American dream, Lou. You
don't steal it.

Then this is even better!

It's drug money, Hank. It's not stealing.

LOU (cont'd)
I'll bet you ten thousand dollars that when

the money.

He holds the packet toward Hank. Hank peers down at it. When
he doesn't take it, Lou tosses it at him. It smacks Hank in the
chest; he catches it as it bounces off.

LOU (cont ‘d)
Why give it up before we even know if
someone's looking for it?

ON HANK, as he stares down at the money, hefting it in his paln.
The other men watch him, waiting. Hank opens his mouth to
speak, but then stops, hesitating, trying to make his way
through this new territory, struggling to discern a path.

Finally, slowly, as if he were merely thinking out loud:

HANK
What if I was the one to keep it?
JACOB
All of it?
HANK
Sust till spring. Till someone finds the
plane.
Lou
And then?
HANK

If you're right, and nobody mentions the
money, we can split it up and move away.
LOU
Why should you get to hold it?
HANK
That's the only way I'll do it. Otherwise,
we can turn it in right now.
Jacob gives his brother a quizzical look.

JACOB
You don't trust us?

Hank hesitates, weighing the merits of a truthful answer. Then:

HANK
I guess I don't.

Jacob nods. He doesn’t seem surprised. Hank turns to Lou.

No promises. If it looks like anyone's
searching for the money, I'll burn it, and
that'll be that.

Jacob and Lou stare at each other, silently debating. Finally,
Jacob shrugs, tossing his packet back into the bag.

Lou
(threatening)
We count it first.
Hank and Lou lock eyes for a moment. Then Hank nods.

HANK
That's probably a good idea.

EXT. EDGE OF ROAD ~ DUSK 28
Jacob’s truck is repositioned at side of the road. The three
men Stand behind it. WE SEE the packets lined up on the
tailgate, forty-four stacks of ten. The three men stare down at
them, mesmerized. Very faintly, WE HEAR a car approaching.
Lou :
(breathless)
Four million, four hundred thousand
dollars.
JACOB
How much is that apiece?
HANK
Almost a million and a--
The CAR is much louder now. All three men look up at once.

JACOB
Shit.

HANK'S POV - DOWN THE ROAD

WE SEE a pickup approaching. It has a bubble light on its roof.

half of it. He waves Jacob and Lou toward the cab.

window, smiling broadly as Hank steps out to greet him.
Hey, Carl.
CARL
Engine trouble, Hank?
HANK
Dog trouble. Jacob’s mutt ran into the
woods after a fox.

CARL
Tree it?

HANK
Thought so, but just as we started to go
after her she came running back.
Carl leans forward a little, squinting up at Hank‘s face.

CARL
What happened to your head?

Hank touches his wound, then waves toward the woods.

HANK
Walked into a branch.
Carl looks toward Jacob’s truck. Hank follows his glance.
BANK'S POV ~- JACOB’S TRUCK
Through the torn rear windshield, WE SEE Lou and Jacob talking
animatedly, their faces close together. Jacob's dog suddenly
pushes her way between them, scrambling out the window into the
truck's rear. She starts sniffing at the money.

Carl leans forward, turns up his truck’s heater.

HANK
Well, we should probably-~

The door to Jacob's truck CREAKS open, and Carl looks up.
HANK'S POV ~ ACROSS THE ROAD

For an instant WE SEE the plane's pilot approaching, his eyeless
face, his bloated hands held out before him, but then WE HEAR:

CARL (0S)
Hello, Jacob.

And the figure becomes Jacob approaching us, the door of his
truck standing open behind hin.”

BACK TO SCENE

CARL (cont'd)
I was beginning to think maybe you were
trying to avoid ma.

I was just cold. Wanted to get in the
truck and warm up a bit.

You tell him about the plane?

Hank stares at his brother, speechless with surprise and horror.
INT. JACOB'S TRUCK - NIGHT - MOVING 3a
Hank sits between Jacob and Lou, his legs hugging the duffel
bag. He keeps glancing out the torn rear window, making sure
they aren't being pursued.
HANK

I've seen you do a lot of stupid things,
Jacob, but that pretty much takes the cake.

Before Jacob can respond, Lou jumps to his defense.

Lou
It was my idea.

HANK
Well, that's brilliant, Lou. .If they fina
the plane now, and they realize the money's
gone, he’s gonna know right off who took
it.

Jacob shakes his head, grinning.

JACOB
That’s the beauty of it. There's no way
we'd have mentioned it if we were the ones
who took the money.

Lou
It's not like we told him you actually saw
. a plane going down. Just that you thought
you heard one with engine trouble. 1 don't
really think--

(furious)
You want me to burn the money?

The other two men are mute, intimidated by his Tage. .

HANK (cont'd)
I'm not going to jail for this, Lou. If it
looks like there’s even the slightest
chance of us getting caught, I swear to
God, it's all gonna vanish. You
understand?

Again, silence. The torn Plastic makes a flapping sound behind
their heads. Finally, Lou throws Jacob a little smirk.

Lou
(whispering)
It's a piiiiiiineapple,

He and Jacob begin to GIGGLE. Hank glances from one to the
other, still angry, and--with no small effort--they Manage to
stop laughing.

Out the window WE SEE a rundown farmhouse. Jacob slows the
truck, pulls into the driveway.

Lou ignores this, brushing at his sleeve.

She’s gotta know sometime. she’s gonna

Then the same goes for Sarah.

Before Hank can respond, a snowball smacks Lou in the neck.
Nancy gives a gleeful SHOUT.

INT. MITCHELL FRONT ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT 32

Light streams in from the kitchen, but otherwise the hall is
dark. WE HEAR pots clinking, Sarah singing. The front door
CREARS open, and Hank steps inside, dragging the duffel bag
behind him. He shuts the door, then hesitates, staring at the
bag. Sarah continues to SING, unaware of his return.

Finally, Hank comes to a decision. He leaves the bag, starts
down the hall, still in his overcoat. He stops after a few
steps, though, comes back, twists shut the door's lock. Then he
moves quickly toward the kitchen.

INT. MITCHELL KITCHEN - NIGHT 33

Sarah stands by the stove, stirring a pot, SINGING softly.
She's dressed in a bathrobe. She glances up, smiling, when Bank
appears in the doorway.

SARAH
Hey! I didn’t hear you-~
{setting down her spoon,
concerned)
What happened to your head?

She picks up a dish towel, runs it under the faucet, steps
toward him. Hank stares at her, struggling to think things
through. She takes him by the hand, leads him to a chair.

SARAH (cont'd)
It's all bloody.

She starts to clean his wound. Hank watches her for a beat,

Four million dollars. Would you keep it?

Sarah gives him a funny look, half-smiling, half-wary.

SARAE
Of course not.

The pot begins to boil over on the stove. Sarah jumps to turn
it down. Hank stares after her, astonished.

HANK
How come?

Sarah resumes her stirring.

SARAH
Well, for starters, it'd be stealing.

Hank shakes his head, standing up, growing animated: this is a
Teservation he's sure he can appease.

HANK

We're talking about lost money here.
Nobody's looking for it.

SARAH
Four million dollars and no one's looking
for it?
(Hank nods emphatically)
Then whose money is it?

HANK
What do you mean? It's yours.

Sarah opens the oven, bends to check on the bread.

But whose was it before?

The question seems to stump Hank. Re has to think for a moment.

HANK
All right, it's a drug dealer's.

Sarah stirs the pot, considering this. It's clear that she's
searching for a reason not to take a drug dealer's money.

SARAH
This is so silly, Hank.

Hank gives her a long look of disappointment, which she doesn't
seem to notice. Then he turns and strides from the room. Sarah
continues to stir, oblivious of his departure.

SARAH (cont'd)
{to the empty room)
I mean, it doesn't matter where it's from.
I wouldn't take it.
{a pause)
It's just wrong. That's all that--

Hank returns, dragging the duffel bag. He pours the money into
a massive pile across the table, packets sliding off and.
dropping to the floor. Then he turns to Sarah, a huge grin on
his face. She's staring open-mouthed at the money.

HANK
It’s real.

Sarah looks almost pained. She reaches behind herself, drops
the spoon onto the stove, touches her hand to her forehead.

HANK AND SARAH - LATER *33A

seated at the kitchen table, eating dinner--spaghetti, garlic
bread, green beans, milk. The money is piled messily on the
floor beside them. They keep glancing at it while they eat.

HANK
If we keep it, we'll never have to worry
about money again.

SARAH
We don’t have to worry about money now,
Hank. You’ve got a good job. We don’t
need this.

Hank lets this go. He stares down at the money, chewing his
food, thinking, searching for another approach.

HANK
Nobody gets hurt by our keeping it.

Hank is washing the dishes, while Sarah dries them and puts them

organized into stacks now. A TV is playing on the counter.

HANK (cont'd)
That’s what makes it a crime, isn’t it?
People getting hurt?

He turns off the water. Sarah begins to dry the last pot.

SARAH
(impatient)
What makes it a crime is that it's against
the law. It doesn't matter whether anybody
gets hurt or not. You get caught and you
go to jail.

HANK
But you aren’t listening to me. The
money’s the only evidence that we've done
anything wrong. We can sit on it and see
what happens—

A COMMERCIAL is playing on the TV, and both it and Hank’s
dialogue roll over into the next scene.

INT. HANK’S FAMILY ROOM —- LATER *33C

Hank and Sarah sit on the couch in front of a larger TV.
They're sipping sparkling cider. The money is back in its bag,
which sits across the room now, leaning up against the doorway.

BANK (cont'd)
--if someone comes searching for it, we'll
burn it, and that'll be that. There's no
risk, we'll always be in complete control.

On Tv, the commercial ends, and a New Year’s Eve show comes on-—-
there are shots of Times Square, frenzied crowds, the gold ball.

What about Jacob and Lou?

band strikes up AULD LANG SYNE. Sarah lifts her glass, and Hank
returns the gesture, but distractedly, merely out of reflex.

just give it up now, before anything's even
gone wrong.

UPWARD until WE SEE .

HANK AND SARAH

Sarah is crouched over Hank; his hands are on her breasts. They
both seem to be deeply involved in what they're doing, but then,
suddenly, Sarah freezes,

SARAH
You have to go back and return some of it.
A lot, like five hundred thousand.

It takes Hank a moment to focus in on what she's saying.

HANK
What?

SARAH
That way when they find the plane, they‘11
assume no one’s been there yet. It’ll put

us beyond suspicion. No one would walk
away from that much money.

Sarah brushes the hair from his forehead, then leans forward,
kisses his cheek.

SARAH
It's just being careful. That's what we

She begins moving up and down again; Hank Tesponds accordingly,

Hank stands at the top of a dingy, dimly lit stairway, pounding
on a Closed door. There’s no answer. Hank pounds again, louder
this time.

HANK
Come on, Jacob. Open up.

He pushes at the front of his jacket. There’s a definite buige
there, which he tries to shift a bit with his hand. He’s still
working at it when the door opens. He quickly drops his hand.

Jacob blinks out at us. His face is puffy, his hair uncombed.
He’s wearing long johns and a too-small T-shirt. Behind him, we
glimpse a small, sparsely furnished, extremely dirty studio,
with a scraggly Christmas tree in the corner.

Hank glances anxiously down the stairs. He puts his hands in
his jacket pockets, pushing out, trying to hide the bulge,

I moved the pilot. We gotta go put him

Hank leans back into the car. When he emerges, he's holding a
jack. He crouches beside the car's left rear wheel, starts to
fiddle with the jack, but then stops, turning to Jacob.

HANK
I want you to take responsibility for him.
If he fucks up, it'll be your fault. I'll
hold you to blame.

Jacob hesitates, thinking this through.

the road, breathless, bewildered.

HANK

Jacob's nose is bleeding heavily, and he's started to cry. He

You gotta do CPR. Don't you know CPR?

Hank doesn't respond. He's peering off toward Pederson's farm.

Jacob starts to push at Pederson’s chest. It's clear he has no

idea what he's doing: he slams his hands down with far too much
force, totally out of control. Hank turns to watch.

HANK

Jacob keeps pushing, too fast, too hard. Hank strides over.

Pederson, takes Jacob by the arm, guides him toward the car.

HANK (cont'd)

Hank slings Pederson's rifle over his shoulder, climbs onto the

CLOSE on Pederson's right hand, as the fingers clench slightly.
When the snowmobile starts forward, Pederson's eyes flash open.
He looks glassily out at the world, then GROANS, jerking his
head. Hank flinches, tumbling off the snowmobile, which’
continues on its own for a few yards before veering to a stop at
the edge of the woods. Pederson rolls off into the snow.

Hank stares in shock. Finally, he manages to rise and

SEE the jack itself still sitting on the pavement.

HANK (cont'd)

He jogs over, picks up the jack, returns to Pederson, crouches
over him. Pederson biinks up at him, his face smeared with
blood. He gestures toward his farm.

PEDERSON

He GROANS, shuts his eyes. Hank is clutching the jack in his
arms. He stares down at Pederson, then across the road toward
the farm, then back at the old man, thinking hard. Pederson
opens his eyes, peers up at Hank, as if surprised to find him
still crouched there.

PEDERSON (cont'd)
Hank..?

They hold eyes for a moment. ‘Then Hank lowers the jack into the
snow. A sudden look of fear passes over Pederson's face. He
struggles up onto his elbows, turns toward his home. WE SEE his
house, tiny and dark against the horizon. Pederson YELLS.

Hank pushes him back down, ducking low.

Pederson tries to rise again, SCREAMING:

Panicking, Hank grabs Pederson's scarf, presses it against his
mouth. Pederson resists, flailing, but Hank won't let him up.

Gradually, the old man's struggling weakens. Then all is still.
Hank lifts his hands away from Pederson’s mouth, stares down at

pinning him there. He leans down, SHOUTS into Hank's face.

JACOB
This is my decision! Mine!

He lifts Hank off the hood, SLAMS him back down, banging his
head. Then he turns, starts back toward the edge of bridge.

JACOB (cont'd)
I'm the one who killed him. I'm the one

HANK
You didn't kill him.

Jacob turns to look at him. Hank sits up, rubbing his head,
wincing. He remains silent, hoping Jacob will let the statement
go, but Jacob doesn't. He stands there, waiting.

HANK (cont’d)
(hedging)
We both did.

JACOB
What do you mean?

Hank slides down off the hood, starts toward the driver's side
door. He obviously doesn't want to say anything more.

HANK
Can't we just get out of here, Jacob? If
somebody sees us...

Jacob doesn't move. Hank glances up and down the road, then
SIGHS, rubs at his face.

HANK (cont’d)
He was still alive when you left. I
smothered him with his scarf.

Jacob struggles to absorb this. Hank moves to the driver's side
door, turns back to his brother. The dog pushes past him,
jumping into the car.

Hank considers this for a beat. It's obviously not the answer

Stops behind Jacob's truck, and he climbs out. The ruins of a
house and barn stand on a rise above the road, along with a
rusty old windmill. WE SEE Jacob sitting on the edge of the
house's porch. He stands up, waves. Hank starts toward him,
leoking anxious. .

EXT. PARENTS' FRONT PORCH = DAY 67

Several of the house's windows are Shattered; the front door is
boarded up. The barn's roof is caving in. Jacob is trying to
peer in through one of the windows. He turns, smiling, when he
hears Hank CRUNCHING toward him through the snow. Hank stops in
front of the porch, raises his hands, questioning.

JACOB
You want me to just drive off all alone?

Hank doesn't know how to answer this. He rubs tiredly at his
face, steps up onto the porch beside his brother, turns to stare
eff across the fields.

HANK
Where would you say you got your money?

Jacob brightens; he's obviously already thought this through.

JACOB
We could tell people Sarah inherited some.
Nobody around here knows anything about her
family. We'll say you guys bought the farm
before you left, and set me up to run it.
{cutting off Hank's protest)

I thought you'd be happy. It’s our farm;
I’m gonna bring it back.

HANK
It’s so hard, Jacob. You don’t just buy a
farm, you have to work it. You have to
know about machines and seed and
fertilizers and pesticides and herbicides
and drainage and irrigation and the weather
and the government. You don’t know about
any of that. You’d end up just like Dad.

JACOB
(sharp, stepping back)
How do you think he ended up like that?

HANK
He had two mortgages riding on the place.
There was no way he could keep up--

spent it on the farm?

Jacob kicks at the porch railing, splintering it.

Hank lifts his hands toward his brother, pleading.

HANK
Jacob, you've got the whole world. You can

JACOB
This is where I want. Right here.

Hank stares off at the empty fields, his shoulders hunched.

Then, without looking, he reaches out, touches Jacob's arm, the
first sympathetic gesture we've seen him make toward Jacob.

Sarah holds a finger to her lips, nodding toward MRS. TRILLING,
an old woman on the far side of the room. Then she waves Hank

behind the counter. She removes some papers from beneath a

Not yet, Mrs. Trilling. Stephen King
recommends it, though. So it must be okay.

Mrs. Trilling frowns at the book, unsure. Then she moves back

No, I want to know: Lou, or me?

Jacob glances down the hall, searching for a way out. Finally:

JACOB
I‘d pick you. You’re my brother.

rh) INT. SARAH’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 7s

The curtain is still pulled. Behind it, the TV continues to
play. Hank sits beside Sarah's bed. Sarah is unwrapping
Jacob's gift, a rumpled~looking teddy bear with a brass key in
its back. She holds it up, inspecting it.

SARAH
It’s used.

She examines it with distaste, then winds its key. A man’s
voice begins to SING “Frere Jacques”. Hank stares in surprise.

HANK
It was his bear.
(Sarah looks up, startled)
When he was little.

Sarah lifts the bear again, reappraising it. She sniffs at it.

SARAE
I guess it’s sweet of him then, isn’t it?

The nurse enters, carrying Hank and Sarah's baby, AMANDA.

NURSE
Feeding time for the little princess.

Everyone COO0S over the baby. Sarah unbuttons her nightgown,
begins to nurse the infant. The bear’s MUSIC slows to a stop.
Sarah leans forward to make sure the nurse has gone, then turns
to Hank. He's stroking her arm, distracted, gazing at the baby
in wonder.

SARAH
I want you to buy one of those little tape
recorders--the little dictating ones--the
type you can hide in your pocket.

HANK
{not glancing up)
What do you want with a tape reco-der?

Sarah glances toward the curtain, lowers her voice.

SARAH
You’re going to tape Lou confessing to
Pederson’s murder.

Hank looks up in surprise, stops stroking her.

HANK
. What're you talking about?
Sarah holds her finger to her lips, gestures toward the other
half of the room. They both stare at the curtain, behind which
the only sign of life is the Tv.

SARAH
You and Jacob invite him out for drinks,
you get him drunk, take him back to his
house, and then start joking about
confessing to the Police. You take turns
pretending to do it-~you first, Jacob
Second, Lou last--and when Lou does it, you
tape him.

Hank starts to LAUGH, but then realizes she isn’t joking.

HANK
That’s absurd. There’s no way it’d work.
The baby makes a MEWLING sound. Sarah smiles down at it.
SARAH
(in a baby voice)
Yes! You're a hungry little girl, aren’t
you? .
She jiggles the baby for a moment, then glances back up at Hank.
SARAH (cont'd)

Jacob helps you. That’s the key. If Jacob
eggs him on, then he'll do it.

But even if we could get him to say it, it

believe it.

SARAH
That doesn’t matter. All you have to do is
get him to see that you and Jacob could
Claim he killed Pederson just as easily as
he could claim you did it. If you make him
think that Jacob would side with you, he’11
never risk bringing in the police.

Hank considers this, frowning. Sarah watches him, caressing the
infant, then reaches out and touches his arm.

INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DUSK a79

Dirty, dimly lit. The scraggly Christmas tree still stands in
the corner. Jacob is slouched on the bed, a beer can in his
hand, the dog is sleeping beside him. Hank is sitting on a
chair a few feet away from his brother, dressed in a suit, his
tie loosened. He's leaning forward, intense, hectoring Jacob.

BANK
It's not like I'm asking all that much of
you, Jacob. You pick up the goddamn phone.
You say, ‘Hey, Lou. Hank suggested we go
out drinking tomorrow night-~'

JACOB
But why would you ask me and Lou to go

Jacob gives him an incredulous look. He sits up on the bed.

JACOB
You're gonna tell me that?

HANK
I can tell you--

Furious, Jacob flings his half-empty beer can across the room.
The dog jumps up, BARKS.

JACOB
You know nothing about him, Hank. You've
seen him drunk a few times, so you think--

Hank cuts him off, impatient.

HANK
Look. You want me to help buy back the
farm?
(silence)
Well?

Jacob still doesn't answer. He realizes he's trapped and is
searching unsuccessfully for a way out. Finally, he nods. Hank
steps over to the night table, grabs the phone, slams it down
into Jacob's lap. :

HANK (cont'd)
Then you gotta help me first.

He strides back to the window, stares out into the night. Jacob
wavers, watching his brother's back. Finally, he picks up the
phone and begins, very slowly, to dial. WE SEE Hank shut his
eyes, as if oddly pained by his success.

HANK
I don't know... I guess so.

JACOB
I mean, that's why they killed themselves.
If they'd had what we have now, they'd

HANK
What're you talking about?. They were
drinking. It was an accident.

Jacob SCOFFS at this.

JACOB
You saw where it happened, right?

Notice any skid marks?

Hank's silence is answer enough. Jacob shakes his head sadly.

JACOB (cont'd)
Dad thought their life insurance would be
enough to pay off all their debts.

A short pause; the mood in the room has plummeted. Jacob picks
up the stuffed bear, winds its key.
“JACOB (cont’d)

A long room with a bar running down one side, a line of booths

fuck it, all in the Past, right? Whaddya

He extends his hand across the table. r+ takes Hank a moment to
understand what's expected of him. Then, while Jacob watches
with Something close to disgust, Hank Smiles, shakes Lou's hand.

Lou
Hell yes! Live and let live:

He drops Hank's hand, quickly downs a shot, then wipes his mouth

Lou rises, a bit unsteady on his feet. As he's moving along the
bar to the bathri 1 he stumbles into a large, BEARDED MAN on a

Hank is standing behind Jacob, holding Lou’s jacket. Lou allows
himself to be led away, but not without a parting shot.

Lou and Jacob are taking turns sipping from a bottle of whiskey.

Lou
We gotta be real quiet. Nancy's asleep.

INT. LOU’S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 83

The living room is a step down from the entranceway. There’s a
green shag carpet, an old-looking TV. Hank and Jacob are
sitting on the couch; Lou is in an armchair across from them.
Everyone's drinking whiskey; Lou and Jacob are both quite drunk.

Lou
(loud)
--so this guy steps forward, right? And he
says, ‘He was doin’ fine till we twisted
his head back around for him. Then he

pretend that nothing is happening. Lou sits down.

LOU
Guess we oughta keep it down a bit, huh?

Hank nods, sips from his glass. Jacob is still watching him,
with something like revulsion now,

JACOB
What the fuck is wrong with you?

Hank glances up, shocked. Lou grins as Jacob turns to hin,
gesturing at Hank, his voice angry.

JACOB (cont'd)
See how he drinks from that glass? Like a
goddamn bird.

He mimics Hank sipping, exaggerating his hesitancy. Hank
attempts a joke.

HANK
You gonna play older brother now? Teach me
how to drink my whiskey?

Jacob ignores him, still looking at Lou.

JACOB
Ever seen me drink like that?
(he downs his glass, slams it
to the table)
My dad?

LOU
Tell the truth, Jake, I ain't never seen
nobody drink like that.

JACOB
So where'd he learn it?

Hank sets his glass down. He leans forward, trying to meet his
brother's eyes, questionin , but Jacob continues to ignore him.

. JACOB (cont'd)
I mean, tell me one thing we got in common
besides our last name.

Aw, come on. He don't care. Do you Hank?

Hank stares at Jacob, who's leaning forward to refill his glass.
His hands are unsteady, and he sloshes whiskey onto the table.

HANK
Crossing the stream?

Jacob takes a sip of whiskey--mimicking Hank again. Then he
stands up and begins making fun of the way Hank crossed the
stream that first day, as they made their way through the woods
to the plane. He exaggerates Hank's awkward hops, his teetering
in midstream. Lou CLAPS and GUFFAWS: it's obvious this has
been a recurrent joke between them. Hank blushes.

LOU
Do him getting bit by the crow!

Jacob ignores him. His smile has faded.
JACOB
We never should've let him keep the money.
Look at him. He thinks he owns us.
Lou's smile fades. Hank rises, picks up his jacket, appalled.
HANK

Look, we've all had too much to drink.
Maybe we should--

JACOB
Isn't this what you want? Me to pick a
side?

HANK

What're you talk--

JACOB
(sneering, to Lou)
Know what's gonna happen? He's gonna end
up confessing. Crawling into Carl's office

I'll be carl,

Hank turns, staring. Jacob avoids his gaze. SNICKERING, Lou
gulps some whiskey, stands up and mimes knocking on a door.
Hank moves back toward the couch. :
Lou
(mimicking Hank's voice)
Carl?
Hank pulls off his coat, sits back down.

JACOB
Yes? Who is it?

Lou
It’s Hank Mitchell. 1 got something to
tell you.

JACOB
Come on in, Hank. Have a seat.

Lou pretends to open a door. He walks in place, grinning, then
sits down. Hank fumbles at his shirt, pretending to scratch at
his chest. With a SOFT CLICK, the tape recorder turns on.

Lou
It’s about Dwight Pederson.

JACOB
Yes?

Lou
Well, he didn’t die in an accident.

Creek. I made it look like an accident.

That's enough for Hank; he gestures at Jacob to stop.

Okay. That's--
Jacob ignores him.

JACOB
Why would you do something like that?

Lou
‘Cause four million dollars is worth a hell
of a lot more to me than some old man's
life--

Hank reaches up, turns off the tape recorder in his pocket.

HANK
(firm, to Jacob) -
That's enough.

Lou
(shaking his head)
I wanna get to the part where you offer to
testify against us. Keep asking me
questions, Jake.

Jacob takes a swallow of whiskey. He seems spent by the whole
episode, drained. He dr back on the couch as Hank takes out
the tape recorder and rewinds it. Hank presses play, sets it on
the table. They all stare at it while it replays Lou and
Jacob's DIALOGUE. Lou looks utterly bewildered.

LOU (cont'd)
You taped us?

Neither Hank nor Jacob answers him. When the tape is finished,
Hank reaches forward and rewinds it.

Lov (cont'd)
What ‘re you doing, Hank?

HANK
It's your confession. It's you saying how
you killed Dwight Pederson.

Lou stares at the tape recorder for a moment, realizing finally
what it’s for. He sneers at Hank.

Lou
Nobody’s gonna believe that thing. It’s
obvious I’m just kidding around.

HANK
If you and I both went into carl’s tomorrow
and claimed that the other killed Dwight
Pederson, who do you think he'd believe?
You? A forty-year-old, unemployed high
school dropout who's Broud when people call
him the town drunk? Or me? I've got a
job, Lou. I don't get drunk and shout
obscenities at my wife in public. I don't
pass out in other People's doorways.

A tense moment, then Lou tries to grab the tape recorder, but
Hank snatches it away, returns it to his shirt pocket.

Lou
(angry, humiliated)
You fucking--
He rises. Hank does, too. Lou scowls at him, waves at Jacob.

LOU (cont'd)
Come on, Jake.

Jacob sags deep into the couch, not looking at either of them.
JACOB
The tape doesn’t hurt you. It’s just to
keep you from hurting him.

Lou
What?

JACOB
He’s not gonna use it unless you tell on
him. That seems fair, don’t it?
Lou
You're in this together?
Jacob finally looks up:

JACOB
He promised to help me buy back the farm.

Lou clenches his fists, his body taut with anger. He glares at

Jacob until Jacob looks away, then spins and strides toward the
front of the house, disappearing down the hallway to the left.

Lou approaches from the garage, jamming shells into his shotgun.

Jacob pushes Hank.

JACOB

Jacob runs outside. Hank remains, looking at Lou in disbelief.

HANK

Lou stops five feet away, pumps the gun, aims it at Hank’s
chest. Outside, WE HEAR Jacob’s truck door slam shut.

LOU

Hank starts to back onto the porch, dragging the door shut

LOU
How could you do this? You think he's your
friend? He doesn't give a fuck about you.

HANK

Lou raises the gun till it's pointing just above Hank's head,

runs off. An eerie quiet settles in. Lou Pumps another shell
into the chamber, gives Hank an edgy smile.

it's pointing just a few inches above Hank's head, and pulls the
trigger. Another EXPLOSION. At the same instant, Jacob FIRES
his gun. The bullet smacks Lou in the forehead. Lou falls into
the house. Nancy begins to SCREAM.

Hank steps inside. Lou lies on his back a few feet from the
door, a small hole in his forehead. His shotgun rests beside
hin. A large puddle of blood is spreading across the floor.

Nancy rushes down the stairs, WAILING. She crouches beside
Lou's body, but doesn't touch it. Hank steps forward, as if to
comfort her. When she sees him coming, she backs toward the
family room, SOBBING hysterically.

HANK

She spins, starts into the family room, but Hank grabs her arm.

HANK
Wait. We have to decide what--

Nancy SCREAMS, yanks her arm free. She turns on him in a
frenzy, CRYING, her words unintelligible. Hank makes a quieting
gesture with his hands. Jacob steps through the door, looking

Hank retreats across the entranceway. Nancy pursues him. As
she passes Lou's corpse, she stumbles against the shotgun,
kicking it across the tiles. They all stare down at it.

There's a pause, then Nancy stoops, picks up the gun, pumps it.
Hank lunges forward, grabbing for the barre]. They struggle,
ana Hank rips the gun from her hands. Nancy falls backward,
tripping down the step into the living room, landing on her rear
end. SHRIEKING, she lifts her ams to protect herself, thinking
Hank's about to shoot her.

HANK

He crouches to lay the gun down. Nancy scrambles to her feet,
begins backing into the living Toom, still SHRIEKING.

Hank starts after her, the gun in his hands. Nancy turns to

end table in her flight.

Nancy FIRES again. The bullet comes through the doorway, THUDS

going: he stumbles into the overturned table, falls onto his
back just as Nancy appears. She aims her pistol at him, but
before she can shoot, he FIRES the shotgun from the floor. The
blast hits her in the chest, knocking her back into the kitchen.

He's starting hesitantly toward the kitchen when he hears—-

standing in the front doorway. Jacob cowers. Hank holds the
gun on him for a moment, trying to find his bearings. Then he
pumps the shotgun, swings it a few inches to the right, FIRES
into the wall. He SHOOTS the ceiling, the armchair, the coffee
table, Jacob flinching at every’ shot.

Nancy lies crumpled against the refrigerator, her chest a mess

blood slowly begins to pool on the surrounding tiles.

Hank stands by the couch, talking on the phone. The coffee
table has been obliterated; the armchair has a giant hole in it.

HANK
~-at Lou Chambers' place. Out on County
Road 27, just past Burnt Road.
{a pause)
They're both... They're both dead.
{he feigns a sob)
You gotta hurry. Please.

He sets down the phone, his hand noticeably shaking.
LOU'S FRONT ENTRANCEWAY - MOMENTS LATER 98
Hank crouches over Lou's body, plants his prints on the gun,

sets it on the floor. He glances into the family room, which is
empty, and a frightened look comes over his face.

Jacob?

He rises quickly to his feet. Jacob's parka is lying on the
floor a few yards away. Hank steps over and picks it up.

HANK (cont'd)
(yelling)
Jacob?

After a beat, WE HEAR, very faintly, a gasping sound-~like a
stifled sob-~come from the kitchen. Hank steps down into the
living room, hurrying toward the kitchen's open doorway.

INT. LOU’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 1
Hank pauses on the threshold. Nancy still lies in her bloody
puddle. Hank stares at her, as if he thinks that she might've
been the one to make the gasping sound. There's no sign of
Jacob. Hank is just about to turn from the doorway when he
stops, peers again at the floor.

HANK'S POV - THE KITCHEN FLOOR

On the far edge of the puddle, WE SEE a man's bloody bootprint.
BACK TO SCENE

Hank edges his way around the puddle. There’s an open doorway
just beyond Nancy's body, leading down to the cellar, lost in
darkness. Hank reaches in, flicks on the light, REVEALING:

THE CELLAR STAIRS

Jacob sits midway down the steps, his head in his hands. After
a beat, he turns, blinks up at us over his shoulder. It's clear
that he’s been crying. Hank watches him from the doorway, a
worried look on his face.

HANK
What're you doing?

Jacob shrugs, struggles for a smile, but can't quite make it.

JACOB
Hiding.

They look at each other for a moment in silence. Hank shifts
the parka from his right arm to his left.

HANK
You gonna be okay?

We can make this work, Jacob. We can--

He starts down the steps, and Jacob jumps up, turning to face
him, scared. He shakes his head again, slowly at first but then
more and more quickly.

JACOB
No...

Hank crouches, bringing his eyes almost level with his
brother's. He makes a quieting gesture with his hands.

HANK
Shhh. dust listen, all right? All we
gotta say is--

Jacob continues to shake his head, covering his ears.

JACOB
Not

Hank stands up, raises his voice, almost shouts:

HANK
Stop itl

Jacob freezes, startled. Hank comes down another step, lowering
his voice, struggling to sound soothing.

BANK (cont’d)

I need you to calm down. Can you do that
for me? Can you calm down and listen to
what I have to say?

(a long pause; finally Jacob

manages a nod)
They were fighting, okay? They were both
drunk, and Lou started pushing Nancy
around. When we tried to stop him, he went
and grabbed his gun, and Nancy ran for her
pistol. We sprinted out to the truck and
got your rifle, but by the time we got back
to the house, it was too late. He'd
already shot her. He was shooting up the
whole place, firing into the ceiling, the
walls, everything. And when we stepped
into the doorway, he fired at me. The shot
went wide, so he pumped the gun again and .
aimed right at my chest... And that's when
you killed him...

sirens approaching)
Come on, Jacob. Say it for me.

Jacob remains silent, the SIRENS closing. Then, hesitantly:

JACOB

»..and Lou... Lou started shooting the
walls...

He begins to shake his head again, CRYING too hard to speak.
The SIRENS are closing.

HANK

And what'd we do?

We ran out to the truck--

INT. SHERIFF'S INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 93

Hank sits on one side of a table, facing the Fulton County
SHERIFF, a DETECTIVE, and Carl. WE SEE a tape recorder spinning
on the table, several half-empty cups of coffee. The detective
is taking notes. Hank hesitates, surprised by the question.
When he nods, the detective stops scribbling.

CARL (cont'd)

HANK (cont’d)
Well, I suppose I can see how it might've
seemed that way to him.

Another pause. The policemen exchange a look. Hank shifts in
his chair, looking right through Carl, straining for a solution.
Then, slowly:

HANK (cont’d)

Because he did go to the truck alone... I
mean, I followed him, but then when I heard
Nancy get shot, I turned back toward the
house. I was on the porch when Lou started
to come outside, and that's when I turned
to run back down the walk again.

(a pause)
So, I guess that's how it might've seemed
to Jacob that I was running out of the
house.

The detective scribbles more notes. Carl studies Hank. Before
he can speak, a policeman enters the room, carrying a pot of
coffee. He leaves the door ajar behind him. Hank glances out.
HANK'S POV - OUT THE DOOR

Sarah sits in the hallway, the baby in its pouch. She stares
blankly in at us, as if she were looking at a stranger.

BACK TO SCENE

The policeman sets down the coffeepot, exits, shutting the door
behind him. The Sheriff refills everyone's cups.
CARL
And then?
: HANK (cont'd)
Then Lou fired at me and missed. He pumped

the gun to try again. And that's when
Jacob shot him.

Hank glances from policeman to policeman, fearing another
challenge. When none arrives, he waves at the tape recorder.

Hank, still dressed in his suit from the funeral, is reading the

containers full of food, jars of jam, foil-wrapped loaves of
bread. Hank sets the card beside them, starts up the stairs.

Hank heads for the bedroom, loosening his tie. He pauses in the

The baby is on the bed. Sarah’s changing her diaper, but she's
paused to play for a moment. She dips her head to Amanda's,
then pulls it back, COOING. Amanda smiles, kicks her feet.

Sarah glances up, turns toward us, her face blank. Finally,
after a long moment, she manages a smile.

On the house, Jacob.

Jacob stares at the whiskey, as if he's not sure what to do with
it. Everyone in the bar is watching, silent.

BARTENDER (cont'd)
Come on now, down the hatch. Do you good.

Jacob lifts the shot, downs it. Everyone smiles; someone CHEERS
drunkenly. The DRINKER next to Jacob slaps a bill onto the
counter, gestures toward Jacob's glass.

DRINKER
Next one's on me.

The man gives Jacob a sympathetic nod. Jacob glances quickly
away. People are crowding around his stool. A woman puts her
hand on his shoulder. For a moment Jacob looks as if he's about
to cry: his face trembles. But then he regains control, lifts
the shot to his mouth, pours it in.

Hank is in his pajamas, brushing his teeth. WE HEAR a faint

Saw a light on, so I figured--

Hank shakes his head.

HANK
It's all right.

CARL

I hate having to do this.

(he sighs, glances back toward

his truck)
See, I was driving by Lou Chambers's place,
and I saw your brother's truck parked right
in the center of the road there, could
hardly even squeeze by it. Found him
inside the house, passed out in an
armchair. Looks like he popped a pane of
glass to get in. Place was all dark, heat
off--he probably would've frozen to death,
if I hadn't happened by.

He pauses, as if waiting for Hank to respond, but Hank doesn't.

CARL (cont'd)
I'd have taken him to his apartment, but he
was pretty firm about wanting to come here.

Hank finally realizes what Carl's saying: Jacob's in the truck.

HANK
No, no, I appreciate it. I mean I'm sorry
you even had to... Is he gonna be in any
trouble?

Carl waves him into silence.

CARL
I know you guys have been having a rough

That's the last place in the world you

JACOB
I didn't... I didn't mean to. I was just
driving and I... I...

He starts, very softly, to CRY. He tilts slowly to the side,
pulling his feet away from Hank, and curls into a fetal position
on the bed, WEEPING quietly. Hank glances toward Sarah, waves
her away. She hesitates a moment, watching Jacob, then leaves.

HANK

Do you ever feel evil?
Hank is startled by the question. He thinks for a moment.

HANK
No. I feel like... I mean we didn't--

There's a "For Sale" sign in the yard; the place looks even more

the road. Hank's car approaches, stopping behind it.

INT. HANK'S CAR - DAY

Hank puts the car in park, waits for Jacob to climb out, but
Jacob doesn't move. He stares off at the house, then out at his
truck, thinking. When he finally speaks, his voice is quiet.

JACOB
Maybe I can get a family of my own now.
(a pause; he turns to Hank)
I mean, with the money and all.

He appears to expect a response from Hank, but Hank just watches
him, mute, Jacob continues, his voice suddenly irresolute.

Jacob shakes his head, smiling grimly.

JACOB
Her friends all chipped in and bet her a
hundred bucks she wouldn't go steady with
me for a month.

HANK
{with sympathy)
Jesus, Jacob.

JACOB :

It wasn't that bad. I mean, we never
kissed or touched or anything like that,
but we walked around a lot together, and
talked, and when the month was up she still
stopped to say hello when we passed in the
hall, which she didn't have to do.

(a pause)
I‘m thirty-three, Hank, and I've never even
kissed a woman. If being rich'll change
that, then fine. I don't care if it’s just
for the money.

They fall silent: an awkward moment which Jacob finally breaks
by pushing open his door. He turns back before he climbs out,
though, his voice like a child's, full of uncertainty.

JACOB (cont'd)
I'm gonna be happy now, aren't I?

Hank only hesitates for a second. Then he manages a nod.

. HANK
Sure you are. We all are.

Jacob nods, too, staring off down the road, pursuing a vision.

JACOB

dusting the bottles behind the bar.

JACOB

Hank jumps up, throws some bilis onto the table.

shirt--before finishing the last.

” HANK
Maybe we should leave. Just take the

Sarah grabs him as he passes before her. With one hand she
holds the SCREAMING baby, with the other she grips Hank's wrist.

SARAH
You've got to remember how people see you.
You're just a normal guy. A nice, sweet,
normal guy. No one would ever believe that
you'd be capable of doing what you've done.

Hank pulls himself free, walks to the window. Behind him, Sarah
continues to jiggle the SHRIEKING infant. Hank shuts his eyes,

rests his fingertips against the glass, pressing till they grow

white. Then he spins back toward Sarah--

. HANK
Christ! Can't you shut her up?

They lock eyes for a moment, then Hank strides from the room.

Hank, Jacob and NEAL BAXTER sit before Carl's desk. Baxter is a
large, crewcut man, dressed in a suit and trench coat. Carl is
behind his desk. His office is-neat and spare-~a filing
cabinet, a nearly empty bookshelf, a gun cabinet on the wall.

HANK
It was snowing pretty hard, so we weren’t
really sure, but it sounded like an engine
coughing on and off. We pulled over to
listen, but we didn’t hear anything more--
no crash, no engine, nothing.

He watches Baxter write this down. When Baxter finishes, he
shuts his notebook, then glances from brother to brother. Jacob
shifts uncomfortably in his seat, making it CREAK.

It was probably just a snowmobile.

Another moment passes in silence, while Baxter continues to
examine them. Then he nods at Carl. He rises to his feet,
sliding his notebook into his jacket. Carl stands up, too.

128 INT. MITCHELL KITCHEN - DUSK 128

Hank has just come home. He's still wearing his overcoat, snow
melting on his shoulders. Sarah is washing lettuce at the sink.

' SARAH
There's no way it's from an armored car
robbery.
HANK

This isn't a guess, Sarah. The guy from
the FBI told me where it's from.

SARAH
But it doesn't make sense. The kidnapping
made sense.

HANK
BHe’s searching for a plane full of money.
.You can't tell me there's more than one of
those around here.

Hank pulls a bottle of beer from the refrigerator. The stove’s
timer BUZZES. Sarah opens the oven, checks inside. WE SEE a
roast chicken, not quite done. She resets the timer.

SARAH
It's hundred dollar bills, Hank. If it
were an armored car, there'd be other
denominations. There'd be fifties and
twenties and tens.

Hank twists the cap off his beer, flips it into the sink.
HANK

Well congratulations, Sarah. I guess you
know more than the FBI.

Sarah starts to respond, but then stops, thinking, as Hank heads
into the hall. She waits a beat, then rushes after him.

MITCHELL FRONT ENTRANCEWAY - DUSK 121

Hank is hanging his overcoat in the hall closet. Sarah comes
toward him from the kitchen.

SARAH
Did he show you his badge?

BANK
Why would he show me his badge?

Sarah bolts up the stairs without answering. Hank stands there
a moment, exasperated, then trudges slowly after her.

INT. MITCHELL BEDROOM - DUSK . 122

Hank ENTERS. Sarah is digging through her bureau's top drawer.
As Hank sits on the bed and starts to remove his shoes, she
turns, excited, the articles about the kidnapping in her hand.

SARAE :
It's him, isn't it? The older one, Vernon.
(she hands him the article)
He's looking for his brother.

WE SEE the kidnapper's photographs: he does resemble Baxter a
bit, though not much. Hank shakes his head.

HANK
The guy I met today was skinnier. He had a
crew cut and no beard.

. SARAH
Maybe he's lost weight. Maybe he cut his
hair and shaved his beard.

Hank continues to stare at the article. They're both growing
impatient with each other; their responses are quick, sharp.

HANK
He wouldn't be coming around like this;
it's too big a risk.

SARAH
You're telling me that if Jacob took off in
a plane and disappeared with all the money,
you wouldn't try to find him? -
{a pause)
Think what we've already done to keep it.

SARAH (cont'd)
What he’s doing is nothing compared to
that.

Hank drops the article onto the bed.

HANK
It doesn't really make a difference, does
it? No matter who he is, I still have to
take him to the plane.

SARAH

If we think it's him, you shouldn't go.
HANK

Why not?
SARAH

He'll shoot all three of you, Hank. As
soon as he sees the plane. That's why he
wants you to go, so he can eliminate the
witnesses.

HANK
But if he's really from the FBI, it'll look
suspicious if I don't help.

As he watches Sarah search for a response, WE HEAR the stove's
timer go off. It goes on and on, but neither of them reacts.

123. INT. MITCHELL KITCHEN - NIGHT 123

Hank and Sarah sit at the table. Sarah is serving the chicken,
which is noticeably burnt. She starts to eat, setting aside the
burnt part. Hank watches her, ignoring his own food. He's
tense, overwrought.

SARA
I'll call the FBI in the morning. I'11 ask
for an Agent Baxter.

HANK
I'm meeting them at nine. They won't be
open before that.

. SARAH
You can stall them for a bit. I'11 call
from here, then call you at Carl's office.

HANK
And if there's no Agent Baxter?

SARAH

Then you won't go. You'li tell Carl that
the baby's sick and you have to come home.

HANK
And Jacob?

SARAH
Say he's hungover. Carl'll believe that.
(sprinkling salt on her food)
No matter who this guy is, we don't want
Jacob there.

Hank starts to protest, but Sarah jumps on him before he can.

SARAH
What do you want, Hank? You wanna just
walk out there and get shot by this guy?
I'm trying to come up with a plan--

HANK
(out of control)
A plan? Like the one to take the money
back to the plane, and we wind up killing
Pederson? Or the one to tape Lou and two
more, people end up dying? That the sort of
plan you're thinking of?

A long, strained beat of silence. Then, with sudden resolution:

HANK (cont'd)
I'm gonna take the money back to the plane.
(a bewildered look from Sarah)
The snow'll cover my tracks. By the time--

SARAB
Hank--
Hank stands up abruptly, nearly knocking over his chair. He
heads toward the hall, leaving his food untouched behind him.

HANK
If we put it back, everything'll be just
like it used to be.

For a moment, Sarah is too astonished to react. Then she jumps
up and starts after him.

SARAH
(furious)
That's what you think you want?

Hank is climbing the stairs. Sarah comes down the hall from the
kitchen, YELLING at him.

She stops at the foot of the stairs. Hank has vanished up them,

but she keeps SHOUTING after him.

SARAH (cont'd) ,
Coming home each evening to this cheap,
ugly house, with the basement flooding
every spring, the furnace breaking down
twice a year, those disgusting yellow tiles
on the kitchen floor? Is that all it'll
take to make you happy?

Bank reappears at the top of the stairs. He starts down then,

dragging the duffel bag behind him.

SARAH (cont'd)
What about Amanda? You think she's gonna
like growing up in somebody else's hand-me-
down clothes? Playing with other kid's old
toys because we can never afford to buy her
anything new?

Hank reaches the bottom of the stairs, turns to Sarah, a pained

look on his face,

HANK
Sarah--

Sarah keeps going, ignoring him.

SARAH
And me? You think I want to spend the rest
of my life stamping due dates on books?
Eight hours a day with a fake smile
plastered on my face, then home to cook
dinner for you, the same meals over and
over, casseroles and macaroni and meatloaf,
whatever the week's coupons allow, only
splurging for a restaurant on birthdays or
anniversaries, and even then watching what
we order, skipping the appetizers, waiting
till we get home for dessert? You think
that's what I want?

occasional odd job, but without Lou to fill
the dead-time now, just himself and his dog
ail alone in that dirty apartment. How
leng do you give him, Hank? A year? How
long till he takes out that rifle of his,
sticks it in his mouth and--

HANK
Stop it!

A beat of silence. Hank looks at Sarah as if she's just stabbed
him in the chest. Sarah remains wrapped within her fury. From
outside, WE HEAR the wind buffeting the house.

SARAH
(with venomous disgust)
Sounds wonderful, doesn't it? Everything
just like it used to be.

She grabs the bag, starts to drag it back upstairs, leaving Hank
all alone in the hall. WE HOLD on him, staring dully after her,
while outside, the storm continues to rage.

INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY 127
Hank sits in front of Carl's desk, his hat in his hand. Carl is
at his filing cabinet, fiddling with a coffee maker. He turns,
hands Hank a steaming cup, then sits behind his desk.
CARL

Well, if Jacob can't make it, that'll just

HANK

A badge?

HANK
I always wondered if they look like they do

Hank takes the phone.

Carl waves him back up the steps.

Hank moves quickly to Carl's desk. He takes the key from
beneath the paperweight, unlocks the gun cabinet, grabs a
pistol. He re-locks the door, returns the key to its hiding
place, and starts to leave, but then stops to see if the gun is
loaded. It's not. He moves to Carl's desk, yanking open the
drawers. He finds several boxes of bullets in the bottom
drawer, all different. sizes. He tries one, but it doesn't fit.
WE HEAR a horn honk. Hank jumps, glancing out the window.

Carl is driving. Baxter sits in the middle with Hank on his
right.

CARL
This guy's body's going numb, the wind
whipping through the front of his jacket.
So he pulis over, climbs off his
motorcycle, and turns his jacket around.
Smart, right? That way the wind won't be
able to come through the front as he
drives. But then, a few miles up the road,
he hits some ice. The bike starts to slip
out from under him and his jacket’s too
tight for him to regain control. He shoots
right off the road, smack into a tree.

Carl SMACKS the wheel, and Hank jumps. He's sweating; he keeps
pushing at the gun beneath his coat, not listening at all.

CARL (cont'd)
By the time I arrive, a big crowd's already
gathered. When I ask what happened, this
gay from Wisconsin steps forward and says,
‘He was doin' fine when we first showed up.
But then we twisted his head back around
for him, and he just up and died on us.'

Baxter LAUGHS heartily, slaps his knee. It's obvious Hank
hasn't heard a word, but he forces a LAUGH for Carl's benefit.

Carl takes a silver whistle out of his pocket, hands it to Hank.

You'll have to use this. Blow on it loud

Hank nods, frowning at Jacob, who's lumbering toward them now.
Jacob hesitates wnen he notices Hank's obvious disappointment.
He raises his eyebrows, questioning.

Hank trudges through the snow, weaving between the trees. The
other three men are nowhere in sight. He stops, stares.

HANK'S POV - DOWN INTO THE ORCHARD 138

From the rim, WE SEE the plane, nearly hidden by the fresh snow.
The crows still cling to the branches of the apple trees.

EXT. ORCHARD - DAY . 139
Hank moves through the orchard. As he's passing the plane, WE
HEAR a crunching sound beneath his boot. He stops, turns to see
what he's stepped on. It's Lou's beer can, crushed now, and
half-covered with snow. Hank grins, bending to pick it up.

Then he starts jauntily up the slope, not looking back.

EXT. WOODS - FURTHER IN - DAY 148
Hank glances around to make sure he's alone, then heaves the

beer can into the woods. As it SMACKS into a tree trunk, WE

Carl is on the slope above the orchard, a huge grin on his face.
He's come around from the east, and is facing the tail of the
Plane. Hank's tracks cut straight across the orchard, from left

pauses, listening. WE HEAR the whistle. Then:

HANK (OS cont’d)

Carl squints off into the woods, bewildered.

crotch. His fingers are clumsy with his gloves on, though, and
he can't get anything open. Finally he just points at Baxter.

Baxter and Carl LAUGH. Hank continues toward them, walking
awkwardly because of the pistol.

Baxter lashes out at him with his pistol: a Savage, back-handed
blow to the side of his face, knocking Hank backward. Hank
touches his cheek. His hand comes away bloody.

When he glances at Baxter again, he finds the pistol aimed at
his head, its hammer cocked. Hank waves toward the plane.

HANK (cont'd)

Baxter glances down at the gun on Carl's belt, then up at Hank.

BAXTER
Then go get it.

Hank doesn't move. Baxter quickly scans the orchard's rim, then
waves toward the plane with his gun.

BAXTER (cont'd)

Hank starts toward the plane. He has to tug the door several
times to get it open, rocking the plane, once again freeing it
of its covering of snow. Taking a deep breath, he slips inside.

HANK
It's okay, Jacob.

Jacob moves toward Carl's body, as if in a trance.

Jacob stares at him vacantly. Hank shakes his arm, shouts:

Jacob nods)
Well this is how you get it. Right here.

You don't have to. We're gonna--
Jacob shakes his head.
JACOB
I can't pretend like you...
(a pause)
Do it in the head, okay? /
Hank stands frozen: confused, frightened, the guns in his
hands.
Stop it.

JACOB
From behind, so I don't have to see.

HANK
STOP IT!

They face each other in silence. Jacob's dog stands by Carl's
corpse, ears cocked, watching. Jacob holds out his hand.

JACOB
Here.

He steps forward, reaching to take back the gun. Hank retreats,
scared. Jacob shuffles to Carl's corpse, crouches, removes the
policeman's gun from its holster. Then he stands, faces Hank.

HANK
Goddammit. We don't have time for this.

Jacob stares down at the pistol in his hand, struggling to think
things through. He looks up at his brother.

JACOB
You have to...
(he points toward Baxter's
pistol)
It won't make sense if I--~

His dog rubs against his legs, distracting him. He stares down
at her for a beat, then stoops to pet her. He hugs her roughly,
kisses the top of her head.

HANK
Jacob.

Jacob pushes the dog away, rises, lifts Carl's pistol. For an
instant it looks as if he's going to aim it at Hank, but then he
presses it to his own temple.

HANK (cont'd)
(horrified)
Jacob!

JACOB
It's okay.

Hank raises Baxter's pistol, points it at his brother.

HANK
Put the gun down.

Jacob nods, encouraging him.

JACOB
Do it, Hank.

Hank shakes his head, his face anguished.

HANK
No...

Tears are starting to. leak down Hank's cheeks. Jacob cocks the
pistol's hammer with his thumb. Hank takes a single step toward
him, but Jacob backs away.

JACOB
You have to...

Hank keeps shaking his head. Finally, Jacob shuts his eyes, his
face tightening in anticipation of the bullet's impact. WE SEE
his finger begin to squeeze the trigger.

HANK (cont'd)

A GUNSHOT echoes out across the orchard, and Jacob crumples into
the snow. For an instant we shouldn't be sure who fired the
shot. Then WE SEE the bullet hole, in the exact center of
Jacob's forehead.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT

Hank is surrounded by the three corpses, the pistol still held
out before him. He slowly drops to his knees, then lifts his
head and lets loose with a long WAIL of pure despair. Behind
him, the plane shines in the sun. Mary Beth BARKS frantically,
while the crows whirl above the trees, CAWING.

TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE TO:
ORCHARD - SAME HIGH ANGLE SHOT - LATER 158

The trio of dead men are covered with blankets. Policemen mill
about the orchard. One of them videotapes the plane, another
photographs the bodies. A news cameraman is trying to approach
the scene, but the police won't let him. An ambulance crew
stands waiting for the photographer to finish with the corpses.

On the orchard's edge, WE SEE Hank talking to a group of
policemen.

CUT TO:
HANK

as two men, dressed in identical overcoats, approach him from
behind. They're Special Agents RENKINS and FREMONT. Fremont
has the plastic bag full of money.

RENKINS
Mr. Mitchell?

Hank turns to find Renkins holding his badge toward him. It's
bright and silver with a big F~B-I stamped in the center.

RENKINS
Mind if we have a word with you?

INT. CARL'S OFFICE - LATER 151

Renkins is seated behind Carl's desk, watching Hank, who sits

across from him. Fremont stands peering in at the gun cabinet.
The garbage bag full of money and the pistol Hank stole earlier
that morning sit on the desk, alongside a running tape recorder.

FREMONT

You know, Mr. Mitchell, for someone who's

been properly trained, there are many ways
to detect a liar.

There's a dark red gash across Hank's cheek, but the wound has
stopped bleeding. He gives Fremont a frightened look.

HANK
I don't--

FREMONT
The shifty eyes of pulp fiction have a
certain basis in fact. A wooden or stilted
tone, gestures that seem either slightly
robotic or unnecessarily expansive--

Renkins nods in agreement, joining in.

RENKINS
Details tend to be vague, slippery.
Sometimes the suspect will cover his mouth
with his hand as he speaks...

Fremont rests his palms on the desk, leans toward Hank.

FREMONT a
You notice anything like that from the man
you shot today?

Hank still hasn't grasped what the agent is saying. He glances
from Renkins to Fremont, gives a nervous shake of his head.

FREMONT (cont'd)
He was lying to you, Mr. Mitchell. He
wasn't from the FBI.

Hank lifts his hand, starts to cover his mouth, but then
realizes what he's doing and quickly lowers it. He struggles to
mask his relief, to feign confusion.

HANK
I don't understand. He said--

Fremont nods; he knows what he said.
FREMONT
His name was Vernon Bokovsky. His brother

was in that crashed plane you found out
there today.

HANK
He was looking for his brother?

151 CONTINUED: (2) 151

The words seem to suck everything out of Hank; for an instant,
he looks as if he might crumple. The other two men don't appear
to notice. Renkins leans forward, opens the bag of money.

RENKINS
He was looking for this.

He shakes it, displaying the money. Hank stares, unseeing.

FREMONT
Bokovsky and his brother were the guys who
kidnapped that McMartin girl last November.
You remember? The one they shot and dumped
in the lake?

RENKINS
Four point four million dollars in ransom.

Hank continues to stare into the bag, completely absent; he
hasn't heard a word they've said. The agents smile at each
other, misinterpreting his reaction. Renkins reaches into the
bag, pulls out a packet, holds it out to Hank.

RENKINS (cont'd)
Wanna touch it?

Hank blinks up at him, too dazed to answer. Renkins nods
encouragingly.

RENKINS (cont'd)
Go ahead,

Hank finally realizes what the man wants of him. He takes the
packet, balances it for a moment in his palm, then hands it back
to Renkins, who returns it to the bag.

RENKINS (cont'd)
This is only part of it, of course. we're
still tracking down the rest.

FREMONT
(confidently)
Just a question of time.

The words jerk Hank back into the conversation. He glances
apprehensively from Renkins to Fremont.

HANK
What do you mean?

FREMONT
We had the money for two hours before the
kidnappers picked it up. We couldn’t mark

it--we were afraid they'd detect the
markings and kill the girl--so we put
together a task force of twenty agents,
and they wrote down as many of the serial
numbers as they could. We ended up
recording just under five thousand of them,
one out of ten of the bills.

Hank stares at them, too shocked to speak.

RENKINS
Simply a matter of waiting for the numbers
to turn up. You can’t go around passing
hundred dollar bills without eventually
sticking in someone’s memory.

HANK
(stunned)
The money’s marked.

FREMONT
That’s what it amounts to. Marked money.

Renkins leans back in his chair, smiles.

RENKINS

pouring out across the Mitchell's living room carpet.
INT. MITCHELL LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Hank drops the empty duffel bag to the floor, bends, picks up a
handful of packets. Logs burn in the fireplace. Sarah stands
before it, facing Hank. She's crying, shaking her head.

SARAH
No.

She holds her hands out before her, blocking his way. Hank just
stares at her, his eyes empty.

SARAH (cont'd) ~
We can run with it... We can leave the
country, go to South America, Australia,
somewhere far away...

HANK
Sarah...

She wipes at her tears, steps forward, holding out her hands.

SARAH
Please, Hank.

She touches his face, then leans in, hugging him, kissing him.
He tries to pull away, but she holds on, intense, and for an
instant it seems as if he might submit. Then he jerks free,
pushes past her to the fire. She grabs at him, and he turns,
shoving, knocking her back into the pile of money. She falls to
the floor.

Hank crouches, opens the fire screen. He throws the packets
onto the logs. Behind him, Sarah lies weeping on the carpet.
She's on her stomach, scrambling at the pile of money, dragging
packets toward her, trying to hide them beneath her body.

Hank stares into the fire. WE SEE the packets catching, their
edges curling, their ink going black. Very faintly, WE begin to
HEAR the grinding of the feed mill, which carries over into:

Amanda lies in a bassinet by the counter. Mrs. Trilling coos at
the baby while Sarah stamps her books. She gives Mrs. Trilling
a fake smile. The sound of the FEED MILL is growing steadily
louder, carrying over into:

Hank is crouched beside Sarah, prying the packets from her grip.
She’s sobbing. Behind them, the fire blazes. The GRINDING is
almost unbearably loud now.

INT. FEED MILL - DAY *168C

Hank stands in the center of the storeroom, his clipboard in his
hand, staring blankly at the shelves, which sag beneath the
piled sacks of grain. The air is thick with dust, the walls
vibrating with the violence of the mill. ~
