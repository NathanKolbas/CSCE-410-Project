BLUE RUIN

(PRODUCTION DRAFT- WHITE 8/10/2012)
INT. SUNNY HOUSE - DAY 1
A spacious 2nd floor of faux paint and crushed sea shells.

A TV REMOTE with a shit-ton of buttons. Behind it, a FLAT-
SCREEN squawks to an empty room.

A SNACK PLATE and EMPTY CUP sit atop a kitchen island.
PUSHING PAST a BIN of CHILDREN’S TOYS, down a hallway filling
with STEAM...

INT. BATHROOM - SUNNY HOUSE - DAY 2
THE STEAM swirls around the spa-like interior.

A PLASTIC COMB rests between HIS AND HER SINKS, under EMPTY
TOWEL RACKS.

Buried within the aquatic echo-chamber, FAINT CRUNCHING.
The faucet SQUEAKS OFF.

DRIPS resonate from behind the shower curtain. Through a
cracked window, an OCEAN BREEZE swallows the steam. A CAR
STEREO attacks and decays. Then quiet.

The shower SQUEAKS ON and the STEAM retakes the room.
ANOTHER NOISE. The water SQUEAKS OFF and the shower curtain
yanks back, revealing a BEARDED MAN (36) with sun-baked skin,
alarmed but motionless.

Muffled, through walls: TIRES ON GRAVEL. THE THUMP OF CAR
DOORS.

ON THE BEARDED MAN: FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT...

INT. FOYER - SUNNY HOUSE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 3
A FAMILY spills through the door (FATHER, MOTHER, weighed
down with GROCERIES and TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS running wild)- a
wonderful cacophony disrupting the quiet.

INT. KITCHEN - SUNNY HOUSE - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 4

The FATHER places REALTOR’S HOUSE KEYS on the island counter,
beside the SNACK PLATE...

FATHER
Hey! QUIET...
The WIFE turns from the THERMOSTAT and hushes the kids.
The TV IS AUDIBLE.

The Father sidesteps into the hallway, seeing DISSIPATING
STEAM DRIFT FROM THE BATHROOM.

FATHER (CONT'D)
Honey. AMANDA. Take them back to
the car. Call 911.

The Wife corrals the girls as the Father DRAWS FROM A WOODEN
KNIFE BLOCK SET, creeping down the hallway...

MOTHER
(urgent whisper)
Eric! What are you doing?
FATHER
(bluffing a threat)
I'VE GOT A DOG!

DAUGHTER (0.S.)
There’s a dog?!

Nearing the bathroom threshold, the Father tightens a two-
handed grip around his weapon, realizing he’s selected a
ROUNDED STEEL SHARPENER from the knife block.

HE SLIPS TO THE HARD WOOD FLOOR, landing torso upright with a
SHARP BREATH.

A Daughter breaks free as the Mother fumbles her purse.

The Father’s lower vantage reveals A TRAIL OF WET FOOTPRINTS
LEADING TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

His daughter runs past GIGGLING, following the footprints.
FATHER
ELLA! NO! Dammit...
INT. BACK BEDROOM - SUNNY HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) 5
Her Father in pursuit, the Daughter crosses the carpeted room
and pokes her head through an open window.
EXT. BACKYARD - SUNNY HOUSE - DAY 6

FROM ABOVE: The Bearded Man runs naked clutching a wad of
clothes, disappearing into an alleyway.
10

ON THE WINDOW: The daughter watches nonchalantly until her
father scoops her up.
EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY 7

Obscured through CLOTHESLINES and fencing, the Bearded Man
jogs to a stop and steps into his worn khakis.

CLACK.
He squats and rises, inspecting his PLASTIC COMB, now
speckled with sand. He blows it clean.
EXT. STREET - BEACH BLOCK - DAY 8
Dressed but damp, the Bearded Man drips a trail up the sandy
walkway, anxiously combing his hair. He moves against beach
traffic past modern condos, older bungalows and monstrous
resort homes.
EXT. MAIN DRAG - DAY 9
The Bearded Man sheaths his comb and turns down a walkway
leading to a SMALL TOWN POLICE STATION.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 10
The Bearded Man opens the door for an exiting PATROL OFFICER,
returning a nod and weaving his way past RECEPTION to a
FEMALE OFFICER (55) eating an egg sandwich at her desk.
BEARDED MAN
If you get any calls about 104 St.
Louis...

She looks up from her desk, chewing.

BEARDED MAN (CONT'D)
-..it was me.

FEMALE OFFICER
Good morning...

He fails to read her expectant look.
FEMALE OFFICER (CONT’D)
(relenting)
I think I just heard that go out.

She motions to a nearby DISPATCHER who removes his HEADSET.
FEMALE OFFICER (CONT’D)
Dale, who picked up the ten-
fourteen?

DISPATCH OFFICER
Maucieri and Lutz.

She picks a WALKIE TALKIE from her desk, waving it.

FEMALE OFFICER
May I?

DISPATCH OFFICER
(replacing headset)
Yes ma'am.

FEMALE OFFICER
(into walkie)
County five one nine?

She deadpans the Bearded Man. He returns an anxious stare.

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE STATIC)
Go for county five one nine.

FEMALE OFFICER
Make that ten fourteen on St. Louis
a ten-thirty-one. Repeat, ten-
thirty-one, same address.

MALE VOICE (OVER WALKIE STATIC)
Roger.

She sets the walkie down and gestures to the untouched half
of her sandwich. The Bearded Man shakes ‘no’.

BEARDED MAN
Is there anything I should do?
There was a kid. Kids.

FEMALE OFFICER
Sure, hon- not do it again.

BEARDED MAN
Use houses or get busted?

FEMALE OFFICER
One would take care of the other,
wouldn't it? Next time, you’1ll be
processed.

He nods. She returns to her sandwich.

FEMALE OFFICER (CONT’D)

And I‘’d worry more about the

realtor. Those places go for three

thousand a week.

Four.
EXT. STREET - DAY 11
The Bearded Man stands curbside, gazing vulnerably into
RUSHING TRAFFIC.
EXT. BEACH - ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY 12
LOOKING TOWARDS THE OCEAN, a CROWDED stretch of beach.

The Bearded Man hunches into a foreground SILHOUETTE,
settling under the shade of the boardwalk.

Foot traffic CLUNKS above as he observes the bustle.
A TOSSED FOOD CARTON lands in the nearby sand. He looks up.
SEAGULLS HOVER ABOVE, aggressively competing for scraps.

THE SOUNDSCAPE FUSES INTO WHITE NOISE.

EXT. BEACH - ATLANTIC OCEAN - EARLY EVENING 13
THE WIND WHIPS across the now desolate beach.

An older couple scan the shore with a METAL DETECTOR.

The Bearded Man collects RECYCLABLES, placing them in an
oversized canvas bag.

EXT. VACANT LOT - EARLY EVENING 14
The Bearded Man drags the bag through reeds and coarse grass.
He digs into his shirt collar and lifts a BALL BEARING
NECKLACE over his head.

Threaded through the necklace, a set of CAR KEYS.

He unlocks the trunk of a BLUE FOUR-DOOR 1990 PONTIAC
BONNEVILLE, in disrepair and weathered by the sun.

He heaves the recyclables into the trunk and latches it.

INT./EXT. BONNEVILLE - VACANT LOT - EARLY EVENING 15
The Bearded Man opens the driver’s side doors, throwing light
onto stacks of neatly folded clothes, books and supplies. A
pillow and sheets line the back seat.

He pulls out BOOTS and throws a SATCHEL over his shoulder.
FROM THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE, chipped paint and rust
surround BULLET HOLES grouped by the windshield frame.

EXT. BOARDWALK - ATLANTIC OCEAN - EVENING 16
FROZEN CUSTARD, AMUSEMENT RIDES and OVERFLOWING GARBAGE CANS.
The beachfront shops cash-in on an ARMY OF TOURISTS.

EXT. BACK OF HOTEL - EVENING 17
The BOARDWALK DIN carries to a hotel service entrance. The
Bearded Man expertly sifts through a DUMPSTER. He wipes
grease off a ‘FUNLAND’ TICKET BOOK and tucks it away.

He rescues a FATTY CUT OF MEAT from a nest of foil. Opening
his satchel, he reveals a FOOD-PREP KIT WITH MISMATCHED
COOKING UTENSILS AND CONTAINERS.

He places the meat in Tupperware, adding a homemade marinade
before sealing the lid.

EXT. VACANT LOT - EVENING 18
ON A TIN PLATE: STEAK BONES sucked clean.

The Bearded Man wraps a RAG around the handle of a dented
CAMPING KETTLE and pulls it from a COOKING FIRE. He pours
BOILING WATER into a CUP.

INT. BONNEVILLE - VACANT LOT - NIGHT 19
WIND through reeds, crashing WAVES, and CHIRPING Crickets.
The Bearded Man reclines in the back, sipping tea and reading

under a solar garden lamp hung from sagging upholstery.

His eyes drift from the page. He slides the ‘FUNLAND’ TICKETS
into the crease and closes the book.

FROM OUTSIDE, the lamp dims to black.

EXT. BOARDWALK - AFTERNOON 20
THROUGH A LONG LENS: Distorted by rising heat from the
crowded boardwalk planks, the Bearded Man offers something in
his hand to several PASSERS-BY. He is ignored.

EXT. FUNLAND - LATE AFTERNOON 21

ON THE ‘FUNLAND’ TICKETS: six are ripped from the book.

A TICKET-TAKER seats the Bearded Man in a suspended track
ride-car and secures the lap bar.

The ride-car lurches forward and up through hydraulic HAUNTED
MANSION DOORS with a BLAST OF PIPE ORGAN MUSIC...
INT. HAUNTED MANSION RIDE - FUNLAND - AFTERNOON 22

The Bearded Man RUMBLES PAST A MIRROR MAZE, BOBBING SKULLS,
HOWLING WEREWOLVES, A MISTY GRAVEYARD...

A STROBE flashes.

EXT. HAUNTED MANSION RIDE - BOARDWALK - AFTERNOON 23

THE EXIT DOORS HISS OPEN: The Bearded Man squirms from the
ride-car before the ATTENDANT can lift the lap bar.

A GHOULISH LAUGH through crackling speakers.

EXT. ‘WHAC-A-MOLE’ BOOTH - FUNLAND - AFTERNOON 24
The Bearded Man SLAPS the ticket book on the counter of a
WHAC-A-MOLE amusement game. A LUCKY KID snatches it up.

EXT. BEACH INLET - EVENING 25
The Bearded Man CASTS A ROD AND REEL from the surf, his
SATCHEL over his shoulder.

EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT 26

By the light of a MAKESHIFT HEAD-LAMP, the Bearded Man
FILLETS A BLUEFISH with a CORK HANDLED FISHING KNIFE.

EXT. STREET - BAYSIDE - PRE-DAWN 27
‘O-Dark-thirty’. A COMPACT CAR drifts by upscale homes,
tossing out NEWSPAPERS.

INT. BONNEVILLE - VACANT LOT - DAWN 28

Cast in deep blue light diffused through dew-covered windows,
the Bearded man lies curled in the back seat.

TIRES CREEPING ACROSS SANDY ASPHALT.

THROUGH THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW, abstracted by moisture,
POLICE LIGHTS roll in. A CAR DOOR opens and shuts. A BLURRY
FIGURE approaches the Bonneville and KNOCKS.

The Bearded Man rises, waiting with blinking eyes.

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
It's officer Eddy.

He flips the lock and pushes the door open for OFFICER EDDY,
the Female Officer from the police station.

 

OFFICER EDDY
I'd like you to come in to the
station.

BEARDED MAN
Is this about the house? I coul-

ON A WIDE OF THE SCENE:
OFFICER EDDY
Dwight, sweetheart, I’1l explain.
Just come with me.
INT. POLICE CRUISER (MOVING) - EARLY MORNING 29
The Bearded Man, DWIGHT, stews in the back of the cruiser.

FLASHING THE CRUISER’S TURRET, Officer Eddy coasts through a
red light and turns off the road.

OFFICER EDDY
How ‘bout some breakfast?
EXT. DRIVE-THRU RESTAURANT - EARLY MORNING 30

The cruiser rolls under a canopy up to a DRIVE-THRU WINDOW.
The SPEAKER CRACKLES.
31

32

INT. POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING 31

A SKELETON CREW works to the HUM of vending machines and a
few SLURRED OUTBURSTS from the drunk tank.

Officer Eddy guides Dwight past empty desks and down a
hallway, carrying a TAKE-OUT BAG and NEWSPAPER.

INT. BREAK ROOM - POLICE STAION - MORNING 32

Officer Eddy seats Dwight at a kitchenette table and pulls
boxed food from the bag.

OFFICER EDDY
I apologize for the mystery- I
don’t mean to scare you. You’re not
in any trouble, everything’s fine-

She winces into a solemn, regretful grin. Dwight settles into
his seat as she takes hers.

OFFICER EDDY (CONT'D)

-you'll be fine. Oh, see, I just
don’t know exactly how to handle
this. And I know I’m not to bring
this up- but, honey, someone
brought this to our stoop.

(unfolding the newspaper)
I just thought you should be
somewhere safe when you found out.

Dwight suppresses a rush of realization.

OFFICER EDDY (CONT'D)
With somebody...

She slides the newspaper across the table. He pulls it close
without laying eyes on it. His attention shifts to a WALL
CALENDAR hanging behind her.

OFFICER EDDY (CONT'D)
He’s going to be released. I’m not
sure how much you... I just need
you to know that you’re safe and
that you can let me know whatever
you need. They are missed. It’s an

awful thing he did to them. I’m just going to
hold you here for a little bit, let you breathe

And who knows? This might even be an opportunity...
HER VOICE WASHES INTO CARDIOVASCULAR PULSING.

DWIGHT’S FACE GOES SLACK.

EXT. STREET - BEACH BLOCK - LATE NIGHT 33

Dwight takes the center of a residential street, moving
numbly through pools of orange light, the NEWSPAPER in hand.

COLLEGE KIDS watch him from a outdoor hot tub. Their mouths
are moving, but Dwight hears no voices.

EXT. BEACH - ATLANTIC OCEAN - SUNRISE 34
Dwight takes a solitary swim in the Atlantic.

And goes under for a long time...

EXT. SUPERMARKET —- MORNING 35

Aluminum and glass CLANK into a self-serve RECYCLING MACHINE.

INT. SUPERMARKET CHECKOUT - MORNING 36
Dwight hands a RECEIPT to a CASHIER and sets a ‘DE, MD, VA’
ROAD MAP on the counter. He looks half-dead.

EXT. BONNEVILLE - VACANT LOT - DAY 37

Dwight pops the lid off a rusted coffee can from his trunk.
He adds a handful of SMALL BILLS to the modest stash.

He pulls out a GAS CANISTER and sets it down.
..-opens the driver's side door, pops the gas and the hood.
.-.-Shakes the canister, empties it into the tank.

..-walks an 8” cube wrapped in plastic bags from the trunk to
the hood.

.»»-peels away the plastic bags, revealing a CAR BATTERY.
.+-props the hood open, sets the battery in the tray and
secures the connections.

INT. BONNEVILLE - VACANT LOT - DAY 38
Dwight places the map on the seat and turns the engine over.

Beside the map is THE NEWSPAPER. An article is titled: ‘97
PLEA DEAL MANDATES VA DOUBLE MURDERER FREED.

EXT. BONNEVILLE - VACANT LOT - DAY 39
HALF-FLAT FRONT TIRES roll back, breaking free of overgrown
grass. The car reverses out of the sandy lot onto the street.
EXT. FOOD MART / GAS STOP - DAY 40
A general store with a fueling station. Dwight presses a
HISSING AIR HOSE to a tire, behind him a display of colorful
rafts and floatation devices. He moves to the next tire.

INT. PAWN SHOP - AFTERNOON 41

HAND GUNS LAID ON VELVET, behind thick glass. TAGS tied to
the trigger guards are marked from $180-$700.

Dwight thumbs his cash and pockets it, surveying the shop:
florescent lights, drop ceiling and linoleum. He drifts along
the gun displays, spotting HIMSELF ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR
atop a stack of VHS DECKS. He locates the security camera and
turns to the WOMAN behind the register.

She glances under the counter and stares back hard.

Dwight approaches.

She steps closer to the counter.

He stops at the register and spins a CAROUSEL OF POSTCARDS.

DWIGHT
Do you sell stamps?

WOMAN
I do. But those ones have postage
included.

INT. BONNEVILLE - CURBSIDE - AFTERNOON 42

CLOSE-UP, POSTCARD: OUT OF FOCUS TEXT, a BALLPOINT PEN hovers
above in contemplation...

In crude script: ‘Your brother,’
A WIDER VIEW:

The Bonneville idles beside a MAILBOX. Dwight signs his name
and deposits the postcard.

INT./EXT. BONNEVILLE - HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 43
Dwight drives a two lane highway bordered by corn fields and
metal framed irrigation equipment.

INT. BONNEVILLE - ROADSIDE VENUE - EVENING 44
CICADAS drown out THUMPING LIVE MUSIC. Dwight watches
HEADLIGHTS SWEEP BY before exiting the car.

EXT. BONNEVILLE - ROADSIDE VENUE - EVENING 45
A jumbo shack-themed bar for half-assed bikers. Dim light
from the facade casts a warm edge onto the VEHICLES in the
lot. Dwight walks along the cars, inspecting their contents.

He tries a car door- LOCKED.

He tries the next- UNLOCKED- and rummages inside, thrown off
by the OVERHEAD INTERIOR LIGHT. Nothing.

Another UNLOCKED DOOR. He SWITCHES OFF the interior light
before searching. Nothing again.

Cupping glass, Dwight checks the cab of a locked PICKUP
TRUCK. He moves to ANOTHER TRUCK a few spots down with a
‘NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RIFLE OWNERS’ WINDOW DECAL.

He spies something on the cab’s floor, angling his head for a
better view.

He circles around and tries the other door- LOCKED...
AND A LOUD FUCKING ALARM.

Dwight flees, nearly tripping over a ROCK- he snatches it up,
does an about face and SMASHES it through the cab window.

He reaches through the jagged glass and unlatches the door,
pulling a SMALL PLASTIC CASE from under the seat.

THE LIVE MUSIC SURGES as a COWBOY exits the bar holding a KEG
CUP, wresting his keys from his tight jeans.

Dwight dives behind his car, panicking across the dirt.
The COWBOY aims his keys at the BLARING truck.

TWO QUICK HONKS and the ALARM IS SILENCED. The Cowboy heads
back inside with a BELCH.

INT. BONNEVILLE (MOVING) - STATE ROAD - EVENING 46
Dwight rolls up his window. DUST SETTLES as he checks the
rear view and opens the case beside him: BINGO- A SNUB-NOSED
REVOLVER fitted in foam with SIX .357 CARTRIDGES.

He lifts the weapon, noticing a HEAVY DUTY TRIGGER LOCK.

EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK - MORNING 47
MUTED, RHYTHMIC CRACKING ECHOES through the river valley.
The Bonneville is parked alone in the lot, below tall trees
and rock formations. WATER RUSHES nearby. There’s a small
PLAQUE for tourists, a rustic TRASH BIN and PORTA-POTTIES.
EXT. NATURE TRAIL - SCENIC OVERLOOK - MORNING (CONTINUOUS) 48
Dwight SMASHES THE REVOLVER’S TRIGGER LOCK WITH A TIRE IRON.
He assesses the damage- very little. He places the gun on a
rock and pounds with more and more might and less and less
control, following it with wild swings into the dirt.

THWAP, THWAP, CRUNK. The metal gives. He dusts off the gun-
it’s broken in several places, the TRIGGER LOCK STILL INTACT.
EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK - RUSTIC TRASH BIN - MORNING 49
TRACKING WITH DWIGHT, marching in disappointment towards the
trash bin. He watches a HYBRID SUV pull in with a half-
hearted smile and nod.

He discretely deposits the broken gun, returning to the
Bonneville as the SUV DRIVER (40), fit and wearing fleece,
hops out with a LEASH and a LATTE.

A DOG BARKS from the SUV as Dwight pulls out.

EXT. WINDING ROAD- BONNEVILLE - AFTERNOON 50

The Bonneville weaves between eastern foot-hills.

EXT. INTERSECTION - DUSK 51
A shadowed ROAD SIGN against a waning blue sky.

HEADLIGHTS illuminate it: ‘PRISON AREA: HITCHHIKING

INT. BONNEVILLE - STATE PRISON LOT - EARLY MORNING 52

Soft morning light. Dwight sits with predatory stillness.

EXT. STATE PRISON LOT - EARLY MORNING (CONTINUOUS) 53
The Bonneville is parked a few rows from the lot’s edge with

a view of the prison gate. Rising behind it is high fencing,

razor wire and concrete.

INT. BONNEVILLE - STATE PRISON LOT - DAY (HOURS LATER) 54
Midday sun beams into the car.

The PATTER OF LIQUID FLOWING INTO PLASTIC. Dwight is hunched

in his seat, eyes to his lap.

EXT. BONNEVILLE - STATE PRISON LOT - DAY 55
LOW ANGLE OF TIRES AND GRAVEL, the prison visible between the
ground and the car chassis: the driver's side door opens and

urine pours from a plastic bottle onto the gravel.

A large sedan pulls into the lot.

INT. BONNEVILLE - STATE PRISON LOT - DAY 56

Dwight tugs his door closed, observing THROUGH THE
WINDSHIELD:

An early ‘90s model WHITE STRETCH LIMOUSINE parks in the spot
closest to the prison gates. ON THE DOOR: ‘CLELAND LIMOUSINE’

From the far side, A MAN and a WOMAN step out for cigarettes,
the engine idling.

Dwight half turns the keys in the ignition and rolls down the
passenger side window.

Their VOICES compete with MUSIC emanating from the limousine,
their smoke puffs drift into the wind.

Dwight pulls his satchel from the floor and rests it on the
passenger’s seat.
EXT. STATE PRISON LOT - DAY (LATER) 57

LOUDER MUSIC and LAUGHTER from behind the closed doors of the
limousine. Dwight’s Bonneville hasn’t moved.
58

15.

INT. BONNEVILLE - STATE PRISON LOT - DAY 58

Dwight squints at the prison entrance. An INMATE (42, white
male) is being escorted out by a CORRECTIONS OFFICER. The
inmate struts in prison issued slacks and shirt, carrying a
cardboard BOX. He’s tattooed up his arms and neck, strong but
with a gut.

Dwight is frozen.

THE FAMILY exits the limousine with a brief BLAST OF MUSIC.
The TEDDY (45), stocky in casual preppie attire, hops back
inside the driver’s seat to lower the volume.

There’s CARL(39), wiry and tattooed in baggy clothes, CHRIS
(46), scornful with teased, dirty blond hair, and HOPE (42),
tight pony-tail and a dark, chiseled face.

A BOY (14), lanky with hand-me-down clothes, scoots to the
edge of the back seat, slouched over a HAND-HELD VIDEOGAME
CONSOLE.

The corrections officer hands the inmate a white envelope and
heads back with PARTING WORDS. The Family Members circle the
Inmate.

Chris motions for the Boy to greet the Inmate, but he
refuses. She power-walks over and grabs the Boy around the
biceps. He shakes her off, retreating into the car as she
palms his chin and shoves it back.

They all pile back in the limousine.

Dwight starts his car.

INT./EXT. BONNEVILLE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY 59

ON THE REAR OF THE SPEEDING LIMOUSINE, FROM THE HOOD OF THE
BONNEVILLE, several car lengths back.

CHRIS rises from the SUNROOF with a PLASTIC CUP in hand. She
flinches as airborne debris blows into her eye, the cup goes
flying as she awkwardly ducks below.

INT. BONNEVILLE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 60

The cup CLACKS PAST Dwight’s vibrating car. He checks the
speedometer.

They're averaging 83 MPH.

EXT. HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 61

The limousine pulls into the dirt lot of a single story
stucco bar. The only other vehicle is a TRUCK FOR SALE.

The Bonneville whips past, maintaining course.

INT. BONNEVILLE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY 62

Watching his rearview, Dwight slows to a stop on the
shoulder.

P.O.V. (DWIGHT): HOPE yanks up a metal entrance gate, a
PADLOCK in her hand. The Family follows her into the bar.

ON DWIGHT as he rolls out into a wide U-turn.

EXT. HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 63
Dwight pulls the Bonneville up a grassy incline beside the
limousine and cuts the engine.

INT. BONNEVILLE - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 64

Dwight has a look around the car cabin and UNZIPS the
satchel. He slides SOMETHING into his pant pocket.

He closes his eyes. Then yanks the keys.

EXT. HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 65

Dwight steps from the Bonneville, looping his key chain
around his neck and tucking it into his shirt.

TRACKING WITH DWIGHT as he shuts the door and walks
unsteadily around the side of the building.

A SOUND SYSTEM inside the bar cycles through RADIO STATIONS.
Muffled, celebratory VOICES lure Dwight towards the back.

He tries a side door near a dumpster. Locked.
A DOOR SPRING. A WOMAN'S VOICE. A CLINKING CHAIN.

Dwight follows the wall towards the sound, peeking one eye
beyond the edge of the building.

Hope is crouched by the rear entrance, opening cellar doors
as the Teddy rolls a BEER KEG from a gated cold-storage unit.
66

67

17.

Dwight rotates out of sight, his back to the wall.

OLDER TEDDY (0.S.)
Stop breathing out your mouth.

HOPE (0.S.)
Yeah, if you stop talking out your
ass. Putting him on your books-
they’1l be looking at you if he
fucks up even once- and it won’t be on me...
Dwight TUNES OUT, drawn to a DISTANT RUMBLE above.
IN THE SKY: a drifting contrail in the wake of a jet...
The cellar doors swing SHUT.

Dwight pivots around the corner- they’re gone.

He slips inside the back door.

INT. HALLWAY - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 66
From bright daylight into a black cave.

AUTO-TUNED RAP SWELLS as Dwight navigates the memorabilia-
lined hallway, his eyes adjusting to the darkness.

TRACKING BEHIND DWIGHT, as he reaches in his pocket and pulls
out the CORK HANDLED FISHING KNIFE.

He passes the kitchen, steadying himself against the wall,
nearly knocking off a framed picture. He presses his hand to
a door and it swings open...

INT. BATHROOM - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 67
It’s a cramped, dingy-tiled bathroom bisected by a narrow
walkway. On one wall: two stalls and a trash can. On the
other: two urinals and a stickered-up mirror mounted above a
porcelain sink.

Dwight crosses the walkway and turns to face the door.

He adjusts the blade in his hand.

The MUSIC lowers, then blasts LOUDER.

ON DWIGHT, inching towards the door- VOICES from just beyond
it stop him short.
18.

The Convict and Carl push through the door, drinking from
plastic cups.

CONVICT
Naw, man- she just talks too much.
Shit- I ain’t used to that.

CARL
She talks shit, or she just talks
too much?

IN THE FAR STALL, Dwight stands silent, shadowed.

CONVICT
(jokingly fed up)
Motherfucker.

The two men place their cups atop the urinals and relieve
themselves.

CARL
What, me too?

CONVICT
Yeah, maybe just let me piss.
Haven’t done it alone with four
walls in over a decade.

CARL
Ha, dude.

They share a bit of a laugh then urinate in silence. Carl
Finishes up and ZIPS.

CARL (CONT’D)
Hey, man. You all right?

CONVICT
Got some shit lined up. Favors.

Carl walks to the door.

CONVICT (CONT’D)
You ain’t gonna wash up?

CARL
Naw, man, I don’t piss on my hands.
(walking out)
You want another one? Or you want
beer?

CONVICT
All that shit...
19.

CARL
I hear that.

The door swings shut behind Carl.
The Convict lets out a deep breath, passes some gas.

He zips up, his face expressionless as he steps to the sink
across from the far stall. Dwight is three feet from the
Convict, DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM.

The Convict pumps soap, scrubs his hands.

INSIDE THE STALL, Dwight watches, sweaty, seething.

ON THE FISHING KNIFE, Dwight nervously auditions hand grips.
ON DWIGHT’S contorting face. The MUSIC IS LOUD.

The convict splashes his face and inspects his pores in the
mirror- his jaw tenses as his EYES LOCK ON A REFLECTION IN
THE STALL BEHIND HIM.

Counterbalanced by fear and rage, Dwight’s thrust is almost
lethargic. The Convict whirls around as the stall door pushes
open- DWIGHT SWINGS THE FISHING KNIFE, CUTTING A DEEP SLICE
INTO THE BACK OF THE CONVICT’S NECK.

The Convict fails to register the wound and rushes Dwight,
grabbing him by the throat with jailhouse power, forcing him
against the stall.

CONVICT
THE FUCK? MOTHERFUCKER.

IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THEM, we see the severity of the
Convict’s wound, LIKE A BLOODY GILL, AS IT RAPIDLY OVERFLOWS
WITH DARK RED FLUID.

Dwight gasps in the Convict’s two-handed clench, flailing,
WEAKLY JABBING THE KNIFE INTO THE CONVICTS RIBS.

CONVICT (CONT’D)
C'MON, LET’S...

DWIGHT RAISES THE FISHING KNIFE AND THRUSTS IT DOWNWARD INTO
THE CONVICT’S SKULL. The Convict lets out an open-mouthed
GRUNT, the KNIFE PLANTED IN THE TOP OF HIS HEAD.

Enraged, with shock setting in, the Convict throws Dwight
towards the still-running sink, then to the floor.

They slip and flail, bathed in blood. Dwight takes a beating
until the Convict BLEEDS OUT, clutching Dwight’s shirt.

Dwight pushes off with his feet, his SHIRT RIPPING as he
disentangles from the Convict, who crumples to the floor,
wheezing. He stares at Dwight, a hint of recognition.

CONVICT (CONT’D)
(quietly)
Do I know you?
Dwight stares back.

DWIGHT
Yes.

Dwight ramps into hyperventilation.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
YES.

He leans over the Convict, YANKS THE KNIFE FROM HIS SKULL.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
YES!

Unhinged, Dwight STABS THE CONVICT REPEATEDLY IN THE CHEST.
Then collapses, completely spent.
SOMEONE POUNDS ON THE DOOR.

TEDDY (0.S.)
(muffled, through door)

Hurry the fuck up, man! Party’s for

you!

Dwight crawls to the sink, puts a bloody hand on it and pulls
himself to his feet.

TEDDY (0.S.) (CONT'D)

(projecting further away)
WHAT? HELL NO! HE’S PROBABLY
BEATIN’ OFF.

Dwight heaves with pain, resigned. He tosses the knife
towards the door.

TEDDY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
(through door)
Told you we shoulda had a hooker
waiting...
Two playful SMACKS AGAINST THE DOOR.

Dwight’s breathing regulates. Eyes on the door: JUST MUSIC.

He turns off the running faucet and retrieves the knife.

INT. HALLWAY - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 68

TRACKING WITH DWIGHT, COVERED IN BLOOD, swaying into the
hallway and heading out the way he came.

Behind him, Teddy walks off, oblivious.

The RADIO STATION runs an ADVERTISEMENT, the stereo CYCLES
THROUGH STATIONS, casual VOICES and LAUGHTER fill the void
until it lands on CLASSIC ROCK.

As Dwight exits, the sunlight is blinding.

EXT. HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 69
Dwight treads heavily towards the Bonneville, past the
limousine. He turns back and STABS THE LIMOUSINE’S FRONT
TIRE, HIS HAND SLIDING DOWN THE BLADE ON IMPACT.

He leaves the knife in the FIZZLING tire, HIS HAND DRIPPING
BLOOD TOWARDS HIS CAR.

INT. BONNEVILLE - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 70
Dwight takes his seat, admiring the DEEP CUT ACROSS HIS
FINGERS. He reaches into his collar, feels around his neck:

NO KEYS.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 71

DWIGHT’S CAR KEYS ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR, the broken ball-
bearing necklace threaded through. CLASSIC ROCK ECHOES.

CARL (0.S.)
(muffled, through door)
Let’s go, brother. Coming in...

In the background, the door swings in and impacts the
Convict’s body, sliding it a few inches on the wet tile.

CARL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Oh...fuck. Oh FUCK!

EXT. HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 72
WHISTLING WIND and QUIET ROCK.

ON THE STABBED TIRE, as Dwight shuffles past.

He rounds the limousine hood and tries the driver’s side door-
UNLOCKED.

INT. LIMOUSINE - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 73
Dwight sits and scours for keys- the ignition...the visor. He
digs in a console CUP-HOLDER and pulls out a set, turning
them in the ignition as the bar door opens.

LOUD, OFFENSIVE MUSIC emanates from the limousine’s stereo as
Dwight shifts and hits the gas.

EXT. LIMOUSINE - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 74
ON THE STABBED TIRE, as it WHIRLS THE KNIFE.

The limousine carves a wobbly path, kicking up DUST as the
Family Members exit, confused, furious, bloody. Hope holds a
PUMP SHOTGUN.

Chris and Carl sprint after the limousine, shouting
hysterically.

INT. LIMOUSINE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 75

Dwight’s face quivers with emotion, but he can’t quite cry.

DOWN THE ROAD, about a quarter mile, there’s a CONCRETE
BARRIER along a curve. MUSIC STILL BLASTS.

ON THE SPEEDOMETER: from 50MPH to 70MPH.

EXT. LIMOUSINE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 76
The shredded tire DISINTEGRATES, only the rim remains,
SHRIEKING METAL and SHOWERING SPARKS.

INT. LIMOUSINE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 77
Dwight TURNS OFF THE BLASTING RADIO.

Relaxing now, with peace soon upon him, he maxes out the
speed of the teetering sedan. HE CLOSES HIS EYES.

23.

In the relative quiet, A STEADY THUMPING IS NOW AUDIBLE.

Dwight blinks aware, triangulating the source- it’s behind
him, in the passenger compartment.

VISIBLE BEHIND THE PASS-THROUGH WINDOW: THE BOY, BEATING
AGAINST THE SOUNDPROOF GLASS, unnerved but composed.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 78
The limousine WHIRS to a stop amidst SMOKE AND DUST.

Dwight exits the car, caked in blood, opening the rear-hinged
passenger door like a zombie chauffeur.

The BOY climbs out grasping his video game console, scurrying
a safe distance before turning to face Dwight.

They regard each other.
Chris and Carl pant towards them, far in the distance.
Dwight pushes the passenger door closed and turns away.

BOY
Did you hurt Wade?

Dwight turns back, breaths some air.

DWIGHT
I did. Wade hurt my parents.

BOY
No he didn’t. He just helped out.

The boy turns and walks the highway towards his relatives,
their frantic YELLING LOST IN THE WIND.
EXT. CONCRETE BARRIER - HIGHWAY - DAY 79

The limousine SPARKS past the barrier at sublethal speed.

INT. LIMOUSINE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY 80
Dwight hangs in limbo, his adrenaline dumped.

INT./EXT. BONNEVILLE - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 81
FROM INSIDE THE BONNEVILLE, Family Members congregate around
Dwight’s vehicle. The MAP and the NEWSPAPER flap on the
passenger’s seat.

LOST IN THE BACKGROUND: Chris YELLS ABUSIVELY at the Boy.
Carl burns testosterone with VOWS OF REVENGE.

Closer to the Bonneville, inspecting the bullet holes...

HOPE
Was that the car?

TEDDY
Yep.

HOPE

You think he was alone?
TEDDY

Do we care?
EXT. ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY 82
The limousine CARVES INTO A DITCH AND LANDS HARD.
Dwight pops from the door, dismounts the SMOULDERING sedan
and walks off towards a TREE LINE on the far side of an open
field.
EXT. WOODS - DAY 83

Dwight takes cover in the shade of trees.

EXT. WOODS (DEEPER IN) - DAY 84

Dwight DRY HEAVES, nestled between limbs of a fallen oak.

EXT. CREEK - WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON 85

A shallow creek of mostly mud. Dwight follows the trickle of
water upstream to a CONCRETE DRAINAGE DITCH.

He follows the ditch to a clearing, beyond which lies a
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.

POV (DWIGHT):
A crowded cul-de-sac of McMansions surrounded by vacant land.
Some homes are unfinished- cars in some driveways, piles of
red, upturned dirt in others.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 86
Dwight watches from closer in, crouched on a hill.

All's quiet. A PILE OF BAGGED NEWSPAPERS lies two stoops in.
INT. MCMANSION - EVENING 87

A well kept, oversized home. Evening light filters through
the windows.

A TV REMOTE with a shit-ton of buttons. Behind it, a FLAT-
SCREEN illuminates the room.

A RIPPED-OPEN PACKAGE OF SANDWICH MEATS and an empty GALLON
JUG sit atop the kitchen counter.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MCMANSION - EVENING 88
PUSHING TOWARDS the MASTER BATH as backlit STEAM drifts into
the shadowed chamber.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MCMANSION - EVENING 89
The fogged-up medicine cabinet hangs open. A PLASTIC COMB,
RAZOR and SCISSORS sit between HIS AND HER SINKS littered
with HAIR TRIMMINGS and pink, DILUTED BLOOD.

IN THE SHOWER: Dwight scrubs the coagulated mess off his
body, his face CLEAN SHAVEN.

INT. BATHROOM - MCMANSION - LATER 90
Seated on the toilet, Dwight pours HYDROGEN PEROXIDE over his
GASHED HAND into a small trash bin. FIRST AID SUPPLIES are
laid out on the sink beside him.

INT. CLOSET - MASTER BEDROOM - MCMANSION - NIGHT 91

Dwight picks through a rack of clothes, finding a modest
outfit: COLLARED SHIRT, SLACKS AND WORK SHOES.

He finds a WORKOUT BAG on the floor and empties it of TENNIS
GEAR, placing the contents neatly on a shelf.

INT. KITCHEN - MCMANSION - NIGHT 92
Dwight chugs water from the gallon jug.

On the counter, the workout bag is zipped and loaded. Next to
it, half a roll of paper towels and his bloody clothes in a
plastic grocery bag.

Dwight refills the jug at the sink and chugs.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - MCMANSION - NIGHT 93

Dwight stands over the toilet pissing like a racehorse.

INT. BATHROOM —- MCMANSION - LATER 94

Dwight combs his hair in the mirror.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MCMANSION - NIGHT 95
Dwight cycles through LOCAL NEWS CHANNELS on the TELEVISION:

- CLICK - “A tornado touched down in Western VA" - CLICK -
“an area surgeon was accused of sexual abuse” - CLICK...

NEWSCASTER (ON TELEVISION)
.«..porch. Small dogs and cats
should be kept in an enclosure if
left unattended, as coyotes are
able to jump fences- get this Amy-
up to seven feet, oops, it says
‘less than seven feet’- I guess
that would make it six feet and
eleven inches and anything below?
Curious wording...

CO-ANCHOR/AMY (ON TELEVISION)
(rescuing her co-anchor)
- More or less Steven, and I was
surprised that they could climb
even taller...

EXT. MCMANSION - BACK PORCH - NIGHT 96

Dwight locks the door handle before closing it, the workout
bag draped over his shoulder and the grocery bag in hand.

EXT. BASEMENT WINDOW - MCMANSION - NIGHT 97
Dwight circles from the porch to a basement window left ajar.

He slides it shut and trots silently across the sodded lawn.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 98

Dwight stuffs the bag of soiled clothes into a pebbled trash
receptacle near the perimeter of a truck stop.

Industrial lights cast a sick hue across the asphalt lot.
BIG RIGS all over- CHUGGING on and off the highway, lining up
for fuel, idling in an adjacent lot.

Dwight heads for a filling station CONVENIENCE STORE.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - TRUCK STOP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 99

Dwight clears the side of the store, stepping into the
fluorescent lights of its facade and within yards of a parked
STATE POLICE CRUISER.

The STATE TROOPER is visible inside, paying for coffee.

Dwight’s eyes track the Trooper as he exits the store and
settles in to his cruiser. The Trooper throws Dwight a
dismissive glance and starts the engine.

Dwight steps closer with an awkward, expectant gaze.
The Trooper backs out, reversing over to Dwight.

STATE TROOPER
(rolling down window)
You alright, sir?

DWIGHT
Are... you looking for me?

STATE TROOPER
(halfhearted jest)
Not unless you’re looking for
trouble...

A forced smile from the trooper, nothing in return from
Dwight...

STATE TROOPER (CONT’D)
Okay then. You got ID?
100

101

28.

Dwight fishes in his pocket, pulls out a RUBBER-BAND WALLET
and hands over a ratty ID.

The trooper runs his name.

STATE TROOPER (CONT’D)
You have a vehicle here, Mr. Evans?
You driving?

DWIGHT
Not right now, no.

STATE TROOPER
Good. This is a learner’s permit
from...
(inspecting the ID)
..-nineteen ninety-seven. You got
anything else?

DWIGHT
No, sir.

STATE TROOPER
Get this up to date. And I don’t
want you hitchhiking in the
meantime, alright?

DWIGHT
Okay.

STATE TROOPER

Have a safe night.
INT./EXT. TRACTOR TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT 100
Dwight stares out from the cab of a truck, the DRIVER focused
on the road ahead. CRACKLING COUNTRY MUSIC and RUSHING WIND.
INT. LIVING ROOM - RANCH HOUSE - MORNING 101
Two KIDS (4&6), watching TELEVISION.
A DOOR BELL RINGS.

A MOM (39) walks through, plucks CAR KEYS from a CERAMIC JAR
atop a cluttered table and exits into the foyer.

A DOOR floods daylight inside and she reappears with a BABY
SITTER (30's).
102

MOM
(to the sitter)
Bit of a late start- you mind
moving the sprinkler into the
bushes in about twenty minutes?

BABY SITTER
Sure, yeah.

The Mom kisses her kids on the cheeks.

MOM
Then turn it off after fifteen.
They painted Shrinky-Dinks last
night- if you could put ‘em in the
oven? I think three minutes at
three-fifty- it’s on the box.

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - MORNING 102

The Mom walks briskly from the modest, two-story home.
A ‘FOR SALE’ SIGN is staked in the neat grass.

Juggling her keys, purse and a file folder, she ducks behind
a hedge and OPENS AN EXTERIOR FAUCET.
INT. HATCHBACK —- RANCH HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS) 103
The Mom slips into the car as water PATTERS across the
windshield. She starts up, plops her purse and checks the
REAR VIEW MIRROR. She waits for the passing sprinkler and
rolls down her window...
EXT. HATCHBACK - RANCH HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS) 104
...She pops her head out towards the rear.

MOM

(friendly warning)
Pulling out!

Dwight, standing at the edge of her driveway, sidesteps to
the lawn. The Mom retracts into the car with a wave.

INT. HATCHBACK —- RANCH HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS) 105

PROFILE ON THE MOM as she backs the car out, struck by a
REVELATION. She hits the brake.

EXT. HATCHBACK - RANCH HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS) 106
The Mom pops her head back out with a furrowed brow.

MOM
Dwight?

DWIGHT
Hi, Sam.

The Mom, SAM, is quietly stunned.
Dwight sets his bag down and cautiously approaches.

SAM
Dwight?

He’s clean shaven, in respectable attire, his ill-fitting
shirt tucked tight into his pants.

SAM (CONT'D)
(searching)
«.-You look good.
His pained eyes, his BANDAGED AND BLOODY HAND.
SAM (CONT'D)
(shifting car into ‘park’)
Or do you?

WIDE SHOT: Dwight backs away as Sam swings open the car door
and stands. A protracted silence, then a tentative embrace...

...the SPRINKLER TICKS ITS SPRAY onto them.

SAM (CONT'D)
Let me call work.

She has another look and Dwight, starts untucking his shirt.
SAM (CONT'D)
.+-sorry, but ‘no’ to this.
INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - MORNING 107
An independent version of Roy Rogers half full with LOCALS.

At the register, Sam lifts a plastic tray, one shoulder
bracing her phone.

Dwight, seated, watches her approach. Two wrapped breakfast
sandwiches slide in front of him atop the tray. Sam scoots
into the booth across.
31.

SAM
Wish I had more time, I’ve got an
asset inventory that can’t push.

Dwight absorbs the surreal setting.

SAM (CONT'D)
You need money?

DWIGHT
No, I - did you get my letter?

SAM
There haven’t been any letters.

DWIGHT
Sent it after I crossed the bridge-
it was a postcard.

SAM
No. When?

DWIGHT
Couple of days ago.

SAM
Yeah, postcards take more time-
Dwight, I’m not following...

DWIGHT
I sent it on my way to Deerfield.

She leans with deep concern.

SAM
I know he’s out, if that’s why
you're here. D.O.C. sends a
notification. And a restraining
order. Let’s not...

She trails off, unwraps her sandwich.

DWIGHT
You're selling the house?

SAM
Have been. For two years. It’s not
really a hot market here. I've
gotten a better job since then...

She bites into her sandwich. Not enjoyable.

DWIGHT
But you want to leave?
32.

SAM
The absolute second I can.

DWIGHT
Why can’t you?

SAM
Good god, Dwight. You want me to
answer that?

DWIGHT
Sorry. It’s fine...
(stretching jaw)
I’m not used to talking this much.

SAM
Well, it’s what people do.

DWIGHT
I know.

He unwraps his sandwich. It’s greasy and grey.

SAM
Do you? Wanna know what I do?

Dwight kindly postures for a storm.

SAM (CONT'D)
I’m a secretary for a probate
attorney.

Dwight can’t ask.

SAM (CONT'D)
They settle estates. I knew so much
about it, he hired me during the
interview...
(fighting tears)
I couldn't ‘just leave’. I fought
Uncle Steve in court. He wanted the
house. I got the IRS on him and he
took off to the Philippines. I was
holding on but there was nothing...
(blowing a breath)
So I married an asshole. He tried
to take the house too. I probably
should've let him...

Dwight reaches for Sam’s hand. She pulls away, then takes
hold of his.
33.

SAM (CONT'D)
Crap. I took us here so this
wouldn’t happen. There’s way too
much...

DWIGHT
I’m sorry I left.

SAM
I'm sorry too.
(sniffs, wipes)
For this busted sandwich.

DWIGHT
I’ve had worse.

They behold their sandwiches.

SAM
As far as the estate- you’re still
owed twenty eight hundred dollars.

DWIGHT
You keep it.

SAM
I spent it on new siding for the
house. It apparently needed curb
appeal. I'll pay you from the
proceeds when it sells- if it
sells. And there’s still a box of
your things. I gave some to the
kids- mostly the toys. Sold the
rest at yard sales.

DWIGHT
It’s fine. Keep it all.

SAM
Dwight, I don’t want it. And you
need to register the Bonneville in
your name if you still have it. I
have spare keys if you want ‘em.

DWIGHT
It's...gone.

They share some silence.

SAM
So, how’s Delaware?

DWIGHT
You knew...?
34.

SAM
Not exactly where. We still go when
we can- every few years, keep the
tradition. Mostly for the kids-
I've got two now.

DWIGHT
I know-I mean... I saw you. Few
summers ago.

SAM

You didn’t say anything?
DWIGHT

I... looked a mess.

His hand retracts and presses his sandwich bun.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
You were on the boardwalk. Your
older one was crying.

SAM
So why now? Wade Cleland gets
released?

DWIGHT
I thought it’d be on the news, but
there’s nothing...

SAM
We knew. This was the deal to avoid
trial.

Dwight wraps his sandwich then stops.
DWIGHT
(whispering)
I killed him, Sam. I killed Wade
Cleland.
She looks again at his bandaged hands, mild shock setting in.

SAM
What? Bullshit. When?

DWIGHT
I think yesterday...

SAM
God damn you. This was over.

DWIGHT
Never for me.
35.

SAM
People don’t do this.

Dwight shrugs a pathetic laugh.

DWIGHT
Thought he’d kill me first.

SAM
Well I’m glad he didn’t.
(quiet, seething)
And I’m glad he’s dead. I hope he
suffered...

Sam's attention is drawn to a LARGE MAN looking straight at
them, sitting behind Dwight at an adjacent booth.

LARGE MAN
S‘’cuse me.

Dwight turns to face him.

LARGE MAN (CONT’D)
Y'all got ketchup on yours? We
don’t.

Sam slides their KETCHUP to Dwight, who passes it over his
shoulder to the Large Man.

LARGE MAN (CONT’D)
Sorry, thank you.

Dwight and Sam stare at each other.

SAM
The Clelands still live up on East
Hundred. The older one, he owns
limousines-

DWIGHT
(between her words)
Yup.

SAM
-How great is that? Operates out of
Charlottesville. Every time I see
one on the way to the airport, or
pass through town- fucking June,
fucking prom... You don’t own-

DWIGHT
WHERE ARE YOUR KIDS?

Dwight takes the wheel. Sam takes shotgun, dialing her phone.
HAND HELD, CHOPPY CUTS. TIME IS BROKEN.
THE ROAD BLURS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
SAM (BARELY AUDIBLE)
She's not picking up. She’s not
picking up!
EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY 109
PUSHING TOWARDS THE HOUSE, THE PIERCING STRINGS CUT OUT as
the hatchback SCRAPES up the driveway and SKIDS to a halt.

Dwight and Sam race from the car.

SAM
No no no no no no...

Dwight makes it to the door.

BABYSITTER (0.S.)
Wait!

The Babysitter stands from behind the hedge, holding the
sprinkler.

SAM
Oh my god.

Sam runs past Dwight into the house, the Babysitter follows.

BABYSITTER
What’s wrong?!

DWIGHT
Me...

INT. FOYER - RANCH HOUSE - DAY 110

As Dwight enters, he’s SMACKED REPEATEDLY IN THE FACE by Sam,
her kids in the background, SAFE AND SOUND. Dwight barely
resists. The Sitter looks the children over.

INT. KITCHEN - RANCH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 111

Sam pulls BURNT SHRINKY-DINKS from the oven, tossing them
into a flip up GARBAGE CAN.

EXT. BACK PORCH - RANCH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 112
Dwight peers into the kitchen through a glass-pained door.

DWIGHT

(through door)
...She knew them from the beach. I
think she knew dad from the car
shows. We don’t talk much about it,
but she looks out for me. I’1l do
it there. Her name is... I forgot
her first name. Officer Eddy.

Sam appears through the glass, Dwight straightens up.

SAM
(through door)
The Clelands need to be arrested.

DWIGHT
(rubbing his face)
All of them? For what?

Sam nervously bites her lip, leaves frame.
Some CLANKING from the kitchen.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
(through door)
I‘1l turn myself in here if that’s
what you want. But I can’t do it
until I know you’re safe- the kids
are safe. Just go.
(MORE)
38.
DWIGHT (CONT'D)
If you want, call the police from
Pittsburgh. As long as you're not
here, Sam.
Sam reappears, UNLATCHES the door and opens it a crack.

SAM
It’s my house, Dwight.
DWIGHT
They know it, and the car is
registered here. It’s not worth- I
messed up, sis...
(fading)
I didn’t mean to scare you.

SAM
Well, I’m scared.

DWIGHT
Is there a gun in the house?

SAM
Of course not.

She walks off, leaving the door open.

Dwight enters and locks the door behind him.

113 INT. BEDROOM - RANCH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 113
The television sits on the floor, an extension cord attached.
Sam's two kids are seated on the floor, watching it.
Dwight sits by the closed door, watching the children.
SAM (0.S.)

Okay. I only told work. Nobody

He opens the door, Sam stands amongst hastily PACKED BAGS.

114 EXT. HATCHBACK/DRIVEWAY- RANCH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 114

Dwight closes the packed trunk. He walks to Sam’s window as
she puts the car in gear.

SAM
I'd forgive you if you were crazy.
But you’re not. You’re weak.

She backs out of the driveway.

Dwight watches them leave. The car stops, then keeps going.

INT. RANCH HOUSE - VARIOUS - EVENING 115
The air conditioner is dialed off, silencing a rickety HUM.
The front window is cracked open, EXTERIOR SOUNDS pour in.

A lamp is turned off. Then another.

A kitchen drawer is opened. Dwight removes a FLASHLIGHT.
A LETTER OPENER too.

Winter coats, a scooter, umbrellas... a closet door SHUTS.

EXT. SHED/BACKYARD - RANCH HOUSE - EVENING 116
A rusty shed door SQUEALS open. Dwight selects a broom-

Street light spills in, silhouetting Dwight by the window.

Just CRICKETS.

Dwight scans the backyard through the kitchen door.

Dwight dozes in the chair, his chin sunk into his neck. He

INT. NURSERY - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 121

The flashlight beam pushes through the door and sweeps low,
settling on an ATTIC DOOR in the wall.

Dwight unlatches it and pulls, inspecting faded PENCIL
SCRAWLINGS that once transformed the inside panel into a
spaceship cockpit.

He crawls into the dark and drags out a CARDBOARD BOX.

He pulls out a shoebox, paper stacks and a dusty yearbook
bound in blue leather. Leafing through the pages, he-

THE HUM OF AN ENGINE echoes quietly through the house.

He sets the yearbook down and kills the flashlight.

INT. STAIRCASE - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 122

Dwight descends the stairs, old wood CREAKING underfoot.

INT. LIVING ROOM - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 123
Dwight floats to the window, LOOKING OUT:
THE BONNEVILLE IS PARKED A FEW DOORS DOWN, ACROSS THE STREET.

DWIGHT
Shit.

There’s SHAPES within the car, hard to make out.

ON THE BONNEVILLE: A FLICKER WARMS CARL’S FACE as he lights a
smoke, its ember lingering in the dark.

ON DWIGHT: Reaching for the garden weeder propped against the
wall: IT SLIPS FROM HIS GRASP, SCRAPES THE WALL AND CLUNKS TO
THE FLOOR.

He grimaces, frozen with anticipation...

ON THE BONNEVILLE: The ember is snatched and tossed out by
the driver’s silhouette, ORANGE SPARKS bounce from the curb.
INT. DINING ROOM - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 124

Dwight sets the weeder down and CREAKS his way upstairs.

INT. FRONT BEDROOM - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 127
Keeping low, Dwight grabs bed pillows and positions them

FROM OUTSIDE, the bedroom window WARMS WITH LIGHT, now a
beacon in the dark.

INT. BATHROOM - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 129
Dwight crawls into the bathroom, craning to FLICK ON THE

INT. DINING ROOM - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 130
AN EMPTY DOOR FRAME. CREAK, CREAK, CREAK...

Dwight slinks in and takes position by the window.

THROUGH THE WINDOW: THE BONNEVILLE SITS EMPTY ON THE STREET.
The front door handle CLICKS. A TUG tests the lock.

Dwight’s eyes dart around. He walks to the foyer, listening,
winding up the garden weeder...

The CLINK of a fence latch from the side of the house.

He double backs to the dining room, hugging the wall to a
side window...

THROUGH THE WINDOW: A fenced, narrow side yard filled with
junk, shadowed by the BLUE LIGHT OF A BUG-ZAPPER.

Teddy moves through shadows with a SPORTING SHOTGUN.
Dwight can hear his own pulse.

He backs into the foyer.

INT. LIVING ROOM - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 131
Dwight peers through the living room into the kitchen:

TEDDY APPEARS THROUGH THE BACK DOOR WINDOW, WRAPPING A
BANDANA AROUND HIS KNUCKLES.

FUCK.

Dwight heads to the front door, slowing his pace to appease
THE SQUEAKING FLOOR.

FROM THE KITCHEN, A MUFFLED POP, SPRINKLING GLASS...
He squats to the door, surgically unlatching the lock. CLICK.
FROM THE KITCHEN, A few more TAPS, CLINKING GLASS...

He turns the knob, cracks the front door, revealing a DIRECT
VIEW OF THE BONNEVILLE.

BZZZZ2Z. Just outside, a CELL PHONE LIGHTS UP with a text
message. Carl removes a glove and types a response. Dwight
pulls back and re-locks the door.

He commando-crawls to the living room, checking the kitchen.

AT THE BACK DOOR, THROUGH BROKEN GLASS: Teddy’s face GLOWS in
the cool light of his cell phone.

Dwight crawls to the SIDE TABLE...

He POPS ON HIS FLASHLIGHT, cupping the beam with his hand,
searching frantically through the CERAMIC JARS.

THE BACK DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS OVER GLASS AND LINOLEUM.
Dwight sifts through rusty paperclips, rubber bands and

coins, inspecting KEY SETS with plastic tabs and handwritten
labels: ‘Honda’, ‘Shed’, ‘Ginny’.
132

133

134

43.

He pulls a moldy set from the bottom of a jar: ‘PONTIAC’.
THE FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.

Dwight pockets his flashlight and makes a fist over the keys,
crawling off as Teddy steps in.

Dwight hides under the dining table, a bit exposed,
containing his breaths.

Teddy enters the foyer- shotgun first, stopping feet from
Dwight. He unlocks the front door and opens it, greeting Carl
with his gloved index finger over his lips, gesturing
upstairs:

THE BATHROOM DOOR IS CRACKED WITH LIGHT, RUNNING WATER RUSHES
FROM WITHIN.

Carl steps into Dwight’s view, nodding: he’s carrying a
SCOPED HUNTING CROSSBOW, a sheathed BOWIE KNIFE hanging from
his belt.

The brothers ascend the SQUEAKY STAIRS with heavy boots.

Behind them, Dwight crawls across the foyer.

INT. KITCHEN - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 132
Dwight steps through the kitchen, CRUNCHING over shards of
glass and slipping out the back door.

EXT. SIDE YARD - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 133

Dwight breaks for the front fence.

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 134
Dwight pushes through the gate and scurries across the lawn.

SQUEAKING FROM THE HOUSE- Dwight looks back over his
shoulder...

ON THE FRONT BEDROOM WINDOW: Carl holding his crossbow
upright, violently cranking the casement window open...

DWIGHT SPRINTS TO THE BONNEVILLE.
THMMMP- An ARROW rips through the air and CLANKS into the

street. Dwight reaches the Bonneville and unlocks the door
with trembling hands.

Teddy jogs from the front door, heading straight towards
Dwight with the shotgun.
INT. BONNEVILLE - SAM'S STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 135

Dwight starts the car and pops it into gear.

EXT. SAM'S STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 136
Teddy slows and levels the shotgun. THMMMP.

An ARROW WHIPS PAST Teddy, SINKING INTO A NEARBY TREE. He
looks furiously up to Carl at the window.

THE ENGINE REVS AND THE TIRES SCRUB PAVEMENT.

INT. BONNEVILLE - SAM’S STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 137

FLOORING IT, Dwight bites his lip and shuts his eyes. KADUNK.

EXT. SAM’S STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 138

Teddy BOUNCES HARD OFF THE HOOD INTO THE STREET, the shotgun
RATTLING beside him. He’s out cold.

The Bonneville jolts to a stop. Dwight hesitates, then bursts
out and drags Teddy towards the idling car.

Teddy exits the house, lining up a crossbow arrow. Dwight
drops Teddy and scrambles for the shotgun.

THMMMP. AN ARROW PINGS OFF THE HOOD OF THE CAR.

Dwight snatches up the shotgun, hands inexpertly finding the
trigger and pump, sending Carl into full retreat.

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 139
Carl bolts up the driveway and through the wooden gate,
Dwight giving chase with the shotgun...

EXT. SIDE YARD - RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 140

Dwight steps through the gate and stops cold. He can’t see
into the BLUE DARKNESS and it’s suddenly DEAD QUIET.

Nearby, A BUG GETS ZAPPED.
141

142

143

45.

He huffs through an open mouth, calculating the risk...

AND DARTS BACK TOWARD THE CAR.

EXT. BONNEVILLE - SAM'S STREET - NIGHT 141

Dwight sets the shotgun next to Teddy and muscles him into
the back. He slams the door and turns for the shotgun-

THMMP. AN ARROW EMBEDS INTO DWIGHT’S HIP. Nearly collapsing,
he limps back, LEAVING THE GUN.

Carl loads another arrow from Sam’s driveway.
Dwight hops in the Bonneville and shifts, GRUNTING IN PAIN.
THMMP, THE ARROW CRACKS THE FAR WINDOW.

Carl drops the crossbow and sprints to the car, opening the
back door as Dwight PEELS OUT.

CARL IS YANKED TO THE STREET as Dwight speeds off with an
open door.
INT. BONNEVILLE (MOVING) - SAM’S STREET - NIGHT 142

Dwight steers, contorting to keep pressure off the ARROW IN
HIS HIP.

THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW: Carl gathers strewn weapons in the
street... The car slows, then speeds up, SWINGING THE BACK
DOOR SHUT. DAY IS STARTING TO BREAK.

INT./EXT. BONNEVILLE - FIELD - DAWN 143
Teddy is unconscious across the back seat, WHEEZING through
his nose. Dwight searches his pockets, removing a WALLET, HIS
BLOODY CAR KEY NECKLACE, a CELL PHONE, a TOBACCO POUCH,
SHOTGUN SHELLS and a FOLDED PAPER.

He pockets CASH from the wallet and unfolds the paper.

ON THE PAPER: THE BONNEVILLE’S EXPIRED VIRGINIA REGISTRATION
listing the owners: ‘Evans, William C., Evans, Katherine J.’

He puts the loot in the glove box and POPS THE TRUNK.

ON A WIDE: The car is parked in a desolate field under a
purple-gray sky. The trunk bobs open.
144

THE ARROW PROTRUDING FROM HIS HIP, DWIGHT DRAGS TEDDY INTO
THE TRUNK, slamming it down and testing the latch.
Reconsidering, HE POPS THE TRUNK AGAIN.
CLOSEUP: TOOLS FROM THE TRUNK CLANK TO THE GROUND.
He strips off Teddy’s hunting jacket, SLAMS THE TRUNK.

He picks a HANDSAW from the grass and positions his hip
against the open frame of his car door.

WITH GRITTED TEETH, HE SHUTS THE DOOR ON THE CARBON ARROW
SHAFT, MAKING A VICE. HE SAWS IT OFF CLOSE TO THE WOUND.
INT. PHARMACY - MORNING 144

MUZAK. Dwight hobbles down an isle with a basket, concealing
his wound with Teddy’s jacket.

‘PAIN RELIEF’: He tips an ASPIRIN BOTTLE into his basket...
‘FIRST AID’: Grabs RUBBING ALCOHOL, PEROXIDE, GAUZE...
‘HOUSEHOLD’: A SEWING KIT, X-ACTO-KNIFE...

‘HARDWARE’: Sets down SEWING KIT, picks up SUPER-GLUE...

INT. CASH REGISTER - PHARMACY - MORNING 145

A CLERK counts behind a register, noticing BLOODY BILLS.
He looks to Dwight.

Dwight: So. Fucking. Tired.
DWIGHT
Just uh...
(walking away)

Yup.
INT. BONNEVILLE - FIELD - MORNING 146
Dwight is prepped in the back with a NOVICE SURGICAL KIT. He
pours HYDROGEN PEROXIDE on his wound. He dips NEEDLE-NOSED
PLIERS in RUBBING ALCOHOL and goes to work.
ON HIS GORY WOUND: Fatty tissue hugging the carbon shaft, the
tip buried within. The pliers delicately clamp down on the
shaft. Then a tug.
DWIGHT SCREAMS...

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MORNING 147

SLIDING AUTOMATIC DOORS PART FOR DWIGHT. He strides in, pale
and damp with sweat.

A TRIAGE NURSE looks up from her computer.

DWIGHT
(depleted)
‘Scuse me. I have a question. Maybe
a little goofy...

TRIAGE NURSE
Sure.

DWIGHT
Do you need- are you required- to
report arrow wounds? Like an
accident- hunting accident. With
buddies. Alone, actually...

TRIAGE NURSE
Sir, do you need medical
assistance?

DWIGHT
Just, um...yeah. A little hunting
accident- my hip. Do you need to
report it, if it’s self-inflicted
..-by mistake?

TRIAGE NURSE
I'd have to check with the charge
nurse, sir. I’ve never handled-

DWIGHT COLLAPSES TO THE LINOLEUM.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 148
Dwight’s eyes flutter open.

They close again in feigned sleep as a NURSE steps close,
checking his CHART.

He waits for her to walk off then lifts his gown to inspect
THE WOUND: IT’S PROPERLY STITCHED AND DRESSED.

There’s a wall mounted light box with an X-RAY OF HIS INJURY.
There’s a bin of BLOODY POST-OP CLOTHES.

He pulls TAPE and TUBING and NEEDLES from his arms.

EXT. HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON 149
Dwight climbs out a window wearing his bloody clothing, now
HANGING FLAPS OF SURGICALLY CUT FABRIC.

EXT. BENEATH A BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON 150

MOVING WITH DWIGHT, as he walks under a secluded railroad
bridge, cautiously approaching...

..-THE BONNEVILLE: PUSHING IN ON THE TRUNK.
Dwight leans in, his ear to the trunk.
He TAPS LIGHTLY-

POUNDING AND EXASPERATED SHOUTS ERUPT FROM WITHIN, STARTLING
DWIGHT.

TEDDY (0.S.)
(muffled, in trunk)
..-HEY! I’M IN HERE! I GOTTA GET
OUT! HELP...

Dwight backs off and plucks the car keys from the wheel well.

INT. BONNEVILLE - BENEATH A BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON 151
Dwight starts the engine, letting it idle as the PLEADING
devolves to POUNDING HOSTILITY.
EXT. BONNEVILLE - BENEATH A BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON 152
Dwight exits, walks over and SLAMS his fist on the trunk.
DWIGHT
(projecting through steel)

You're alone. You came into my

sister’s house with guns. Unless

you be quiet, I WILL DRIVE THIS

DAMNED CAR OFF A BRIDGE!
The pounding and yelling stop. Dwight walks off...
ON A PROFILE SHOT OF THE TRUNK (MOUNTED TO THE CAR).

Dwight returns, bending down into frame.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
I just want this to be over.

TEDDY (0.S.)
(muffled, through trunk)
SURE, MAN. LET ME OUT AND THIS CAN
END RIGHT NOW.
DWIGHT
You guys got guns. I’m not opening
the trunk until I have one.

TEDDY
Shit, I could get-

DWIGHT
BE QUIET.

Dwight exits frame: HOLD ON TRUNK SHOT...

CUT TO:

EXT. THRIFT STORE - EVENING (CAR MOUNT) 153
JUMP CUT OF THE SAME TRUNK SHOT, in a parking lot donation
site. Dwight sorts through MATTRESSES and JUNK, expertly
digging out a BAG OF CLOTHES...

intersection...

CUT TO:

A WIDE PROFILE OF THE STAIRCASE. A faint RUSH..

Dwight treads heavily through the door and up the stairs.

INT. BATHROOM - RANCH HOUSE - EVENING (CONTINUOUS) 158

ON THE SINK, THE WATER STILL RUNNING. Dwight turns the faucet
off, hits the lights and heads downstairs.

Halfway down, he doubles back...

INT. NURSERY - RANCH HOUSE - EVENING 159

Dwight’s CARDBOARD BOX, where he left it. He drags it off.

EXT. SIDE YARD - RANCH HOUSE - EVENING 160
Dwight places the box in the garbage, salvaging the YEARBOOK.

He folds up a cardboard top-flap and RIPS IT OFF.

Dwight TAPES THE CARDBOARD FLAP OVER THE BROKEN WINDOW.

He sweeps up GLASS with a BROOM and DUSTPAN.

INT. FOYER - RANCH HOUSE - EVENING 162
ON THE FRONT DOOR: Dwight swings it open and exits.
It LOCKS from outside.

HE DROPS THE HOUSE KEYS THROUGH THE MAIL SLOT.

INT. BONNEVILLE - PARK - NIGHT 163
Dwight flips though his YEARBOOK, circa 1996: TEENAGE
PORTRAITS, names in black type: denim, Hard Rock Cafe’
shirts, acne, crimped hair and braces.

BZZ2ZZZ2Z. A vibration inside the car. Dwight opens the glove
compartment and removes Teddy’s CELL PHONE.

ON THE SCREEN: ‘C IS BACK. WHERE R U?!’
164

TEDDY (0.S.)
(muffled, through trunk)
WHAT’S THAT? I NEED WATER.

DWIGHT
NOT UNTIL I HAVE A GUN.

Dwight sets the phone down and returns to the yearbook.

ON THE YEARBOOK: UNDER THE HEADING ‘JROTC’, A PORTRAIT OF A
TEENAGER IN MILITARY FATIGUES.

TYPED UNDERNEATH: ‘BENJAMIN GALICIA’

EXT. BEN’S MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 164

An interior door opens inward, MARGARET GALICIA (67) stands
guardedly behind a screen door.

MARGARET
Yes?

DWIGHT
Hi, Mrs. Galicia. I’m looking for
Ben. Is he still in town?

MARGARET
No, he moved a while ago.

DWIGHT
Okay. I’m Dwight, from Orange High.
I just...

MARGARET
Oh! I’m so sorry- you had me a
little scared. Mr. Galicia is
already in bed. I didn’t recognize
you, Dwight.
(a rush of sympathy)
Oh my.

Dwight deflects with a polite nod.
MARGARET (CONT’D)
Ben has a house near Wyndam. Come
in, I'll write down the address...

Margaret unlocks the screen door and Dwight follows her
inside.
165

52.

INT. KITCHEN - BEN’S MOTHERS HOUSE - NIGHT 165

MARGARET
He moved when he got back from
Japan. He was deployed...

Margaret leads Dwight to the kitchen table. She opens her
address book on the counter, picks up a phone and dials.

DWIGHT
Oh, he doesn’t know I’m coming-

MARGARET
(gesturing to sit)
Oh he’1l be thrilled...

He watches her as the line TONES.

MARGARET (CONT’D)
(hanging up)
He’s not picking up. He works at a
concert hall in the city. He's
probably playing tonight...

DWIGHT
Richmond?

MARGARET
Yes. I never remember the name.
It’s not a nice place...

She passes a finger along POST-ITS, MAGNETS and PHOTOS
displayed on her refrigerator. She slides a BUSINESS CARD
from under a magnet and brings her address book to the table.

Dwight watches her pencil information onto the card and into
her book.

MARGARET (CONT’D)

This way...we can both have
everything...just need this...for
myself...

(pointing to the card)
Here. This is where he works.

(flipping it)
This is where he lives. You can
take this ‘to go’.

A TEA KETTLE WHISTLES. She hands the card over and rises.
MARGARET (CONT’D)

You might need a map, it’s out of
the way, off six twenty four.
166

53.
DWIGHT
I’ve got a map. Thank you.

MARGARET
Are you in a rush?

DWIGHT
Sort of. Yes, ma'am.

MARGARET
I'd offer you tea, otherwise.

Dwight glances around, and at Margaret.

DWIGHT
I'd love some, Mrs. Galicia.

MARGARET
Oh good! Ben works late anyway. And
they play God awful music...

warm kitchen glow.

CUT TO:

INT. BONNEVILLE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - NIGHT 167
POUNDING FROM THE TRUNK.

Dwight speeds down the road, patting around his seat. He
checks the glove box, shuts it.

He reads the address off the business card, looks ahead.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:
A HIGHWAY SIGN: ‘Zion Crossroads, Fork Union Exit 136’

ANOTHER: ‘I64E Richmond’

EXT. MUSIC VENUE - NIGHT 168

MUSIC BELLOWS WITHIN a textured concrete building with

INT. ENTRY HALLWAY - MUSIC VENUE - NIGHT 169

Dwight angles past SMOKERS, along a vinyl rope partition,
greeted by a ROCK GIRL (20s).

ROCK GIRL
(over the music)
FIVE DOLLARS.

Disoriented by the THROBBING MUSIC, he pulls CRINKLED BILLS
from his pocket and hands them over.

He continues past the Rock Girl as she counts six singles
then yanks Dwight back.

ROCK GIRL (CONT'D)
HOLD ON...

Dwight resists as she steadies his arm, shoves the extra
dollar in his hand and STAMPS IT with a BLACK-LIGHT LOGO. He
hurries off, inspecting it...

ON HIS HAND IN GLOWING INK: ‘STRANGE MATTER’

INT. MAIN ROOM - MUSIC VENUE - NIGHT 170

Dwight dips through the crowd to the STAGE. He checks out the
BAND MEMBERS. NOTHING.

He scans around, lost.

INT. ENTRY HALLWAY - MUSIC VENUE - NIGHT 171
The Rock Girl rolls her eyes as Dwight timidly approaches.

DWIGHT
EXCUSE ME. I’M LOOKING FOR A BAND
MEMBER NAMED BEN. BEN GALICIA. HE’S
SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING TONIGHT?

ROCK GIRL
YEAH. BENNY?

DWIGHT
YES.

ROCK GIRL

HE’S HERE- HE WORKS THE BOARD. HE’S
NOT IN THE BAND.

DWIGHT
THAT’S FINE. WHEN DOES HE GO HOME?
172

55.

ROCK GIRL
AROUND TWO-THIRTY OR THREE.

DWIGHT
I’LL WAIT HERE.

ROCK GIRL
HE USUALLY LEAVES OUT THE BACK. YOU
CAN'T WAIT HERE.

DWIGHT
(pivoting in search)
OKAY. I’LL WAIT OUT AROUND BACK.

ROCK GIRL
(pointing)
OUT THE FRONT AND AROUND THAT WAY.
THERE’S AN ALLEY.

DWIGHT
THANK YOU. DO YOU THINK I COULD
HAVE MY MONEY BACK? I COULDN’T STAY

IN THERE...
ROCK GIRL
NO, MAN. YOU’RE GONNA NEED TO FUCK
OFF...
DWIGHT
OKAY.
EXT. BACK ALLEY - MUSIC VENUE - NIGHT (LATER) 172

IT’S QUIET. A BAND is loading up GEAR into a CONVERSION VAN.

IN THE RED WASH OF BREAK LIGHTS, Dwight watches them pull
out. He’s alone.

There’s a DUMPSTER across the alley. He walks over, places
his hand on the rim and rises onto tip-toes. He peeks in-

A METAL DOOR SCREECHES OPEN. Dwight wipes his hands on his
shirt, observing a LARGE MAN with long black hair turn down
the alley.

DWIGHT
Ben?

The Large Man walks on, insulated by HEAVY METAL MUSIC
coursing through his HEADPHONES.

Dwight follows.
173

174

56.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT 173

Dwight steps from the alley, guided by HEADPHONE SPILL.

EXT. VENUE PARKING LOT - NIGHT 174

The Large Man unlocks his PICKUP. Dwight stops short of the
truck, noting the numerous MILITARY AND FIREARM DECALS.

DWIGHT
BEN!

The Large Man turns, whipping his headphones off, LOUDER
around his neck. Dwight stands ready with a cautious hand.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
Ben. Hey, it’s Dwight. Evans.

The Large Man, BEN, walks over, assessing the claim. Dwight
meets him at the tailgate and they shake.

BEN
Wow, bro- you look square.

DWIGHT
I’ve been away.

Ben nods, waiting for more.

BEN
No shit, man- just peaced-the-fuck-
out...

He pulls out cigarettes, Dwight declines and Ben lights up.

BEN (CONT'D)
...Same year El Duce got hit by a
train.
(slaps his truck)
Yo, I put the first two hundred
miles on this thing stapling up
your ‘missing’ posters.

DWIGHT
(struck, ashamed)
Never thought of that.

BEN
Your sister, man. She was hell
bent. Then I think a bunch of your
parking tickets came in the mail-
she called it all off...
57.

Dwight nods, thrown off. They listen to HEADPHONE CRACKLE.

BEN (CONT'D)
I took off too!
(lifting shirt, showing a
‘U.S.M.C.’ tattoo)
Joined up soon as I graduated. Nev-

Ben cuts himself off, cocking his head.

BEN (CONT'D)

Was...that you?
(pointing back)

By the dumpster?

DWIGHT

Yeah.
BEN

Yeah... So should we get beers?
DWIGHT

Look, I need to warn you that I’m
here- that I came to you- for a
favor. A big one.

Ben reaches in his jacket, SILENCING HIS HEADPHONES.

BEN
Sure. What do you need?

DWIGHT
I need a gun. And I don’t have a
lot of time to get it. You were the
only person I could trust.

BEN
Whoa.

DWIGHT
And has guns.

BEN
(taking a drag)
Shit, man- you can pretty much buy
one anywhere.

DWIGHT
I tried to get one on my own. I
don’t have any money- wait...
(digging crumpled bills
from his pocket)
I mean, I’ve got- but my I.D. is-

58.

BEN
Hold on. Are you a junkie, dude?
DWIGHT
No. No, I shouldn't have just...
BEN
(realizing)
Oh, wait. Shit. It’s about that

time...
Ben gives a subtle nod, takes another drag.

BEN (CONT'D)
Yeah. Hop in brother.

Ben heads to his truck.

DWIGHT
I should take my car...

BEN

You gassed up? I’m in the boonies.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 175
The Bonneville’s headlights project onto kicked-up dust from
Ben’s truck. The tree-lined road vanishes into pitch black.
EXT. BEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT 176
The two vehicles pull past a shotgun shack up to a single
story prefab house. Dwight parks twenty feet short.
INT. BEDROOM - BEN’S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN 177

HALLWAY LIGHTS CLICK ON. Ben leads Dwight into the sparse,
earthy room, neatly kept if a bit dank.

BEN
Hey- I got something..

DWIGHT
What’s that?

Ben opens a JUNK DRAWER in a old bureau, rifles through it.

BEN
You remember when James Henry’s
brother had the stripper at his
party? At his shop?
59.

DWIGHT
Haven't thought that far back in a
while.

BEN

I got a Polaroid of me and you with
the stripper. It’s hilarious- we’re
both terrified.

DWIGHT
Ben. I need to hurry.

Ben nods, shoving the drawer closed, turning to two METAL
LOCKERS along the wall.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
Do you hunt?

BEN
Very little.

Ben pulls a MAGNETIC BOX from behind a locker, shaking out
KEYS and turning them in the locks.

BEN (CONT'D)
More into target shooting. What do
you need it for?

DWIGHT
I’d rather...

BEN
Oh- no, man. The less I know, the
better. What do you need out of the
gun. At range? Close quarters?

Dwight stands at a loss as Ben swings open the doors.

BEN (CONT'D)
Close up or far away?

DWIGHT
Probably close. I don’t know.
Hopefully not at all.

BEN
Roger that. See what I’ve got...
(running his hand along
the racks)
An Enfield mark three, Circuit
Judge, a Mosin...

He pulls out a vintage BOLT-ACTION RIFLE, feeling the weight.
60.

BEN (CONT'D)
..-which is my current favorite.
Bolt action, heavy, and the surplus
ammo is cheap.

He sets it on the bed and wipes his nose.
BEN (CONT'D)

The AK, Mossberg- might be a bit
much. What do you weigh?

DWIGHT
Don’t know.
BEN
...the Sterling might jam up on

you.
Ben pulls out a VINTAGE SUB MACHINE GUN.

BEN (CONT'D)
It’ll clear a room, though. Ah.

He replaces the sub machine gun, removing a bulky automatic
pistol from the cabinet.

BEN (CONT'D)
I picked this up this year. Steyr
nineteen-twelve. Shoots it’s own
nine mil cartridge, great shape-
but you gotta load it slide-back
with a stripper clip.

DWIGHT
Nothing that’s special to you- the
least expensive, as long as it
works...

BEN
The World War I and II models are
bring-backs- no papers, no import
marks. But you don’t want a bolt-
action...

Dwight stews in ignorance. Ben reads it, selecting a MINI-14
RIFLE.

BEN (CONT'D)
Here. The Mini Fourteen. Gunshow-
no papers. It’s a carbine- that
just means it’s short. Semi-auto-
it fires every time you pull the
trigger- twenty rounds. Very
reliable. Plus, I got ammo here.
61.

Ben expertly loads a clip and assumes a firing position, his
trigger finger extended against the guard.

BEN (CONT'D)
Recognize it?

Dwight shakes ‘no’.

BEN (CONT'D)
It’s the A-Team gun. From the show.
Their’s were stainless...

Ben presents the rifle. Dwight grabs it, but Ben holds firm.

BEN (CONT'D)
(nodding)
What’s up with that?

Dwight follows Ben’s gaze to a BLOOD STAIN on his SHIRT AND
PANTS.

DWIGHT
Oh, that’s not- it’s from an arrow.
It’s stitched up.

BEN
Not so well, huh.

Ben lets go of the rifle. Dwight feels the weight.

BEN (CONT'D)
So then, you’re already in this?

DWIGHT
Yes.

Ben locks eyes with sincere concern.

BEN
Because I was just blowing smoke up
your ass, bro. Preparing a speech
in my head to stop you from
whatever crazy shit you’re about to
do.

DWIGHT
It’s already done...

BEN
Thought about calling the cops.

DWIGHT
Please don’t. Not yet. I don’t have
a speech- just please trust me.
178

62.

BEN
I do, bro. But I can’t send you off
like this. I could teach you. CQB,
man! Surprise, speed, violence of

action...

DWIGHT
I just need somewhere quiet right
now.

BEN

I’ve got sixteen acres. Follow the
road we came in on ‘till it ends-
you'll see the targets.

DWIGHT
Thanks.

BEN
You right handed?

Dwight nods ‘yes’.

BEN (CONT'D)
Real quick. Keep the safety off.
Wherever your eyes look, the gun
follows. And keep your distance- or
it can get sloppy.

DWIGHT
I know. You ever killed anyone?

BEN
(shutting the lockers)
Two on purpose.
DWIGHT
(nodding thoughtfully)
Can I get a thing of water?
EXT. SECLUDED AREA - BEN’S PROPERTY - EARLY MORNING 178
A dead end clearing littered with SANDBAGS, TRAFFIC CONES,
SHOT-UP TARGETS and a ROTTING PICNIC TABLE. A field of tall
grass flanks one side.
CLOSE-UP: A WATER BOTTLE is placed on grass.

ON DWIGHT, rising with the MINI-14 RIFLE, like a seven year
old about to jump off the high-dive for the first time.

ON THE TRUNK OF THE BONNEVILLE.

INT./EXT. BONNEVILLE - SECLUDED AREA - EARLY MORNING 179

The passenger door hangs open. Dwight takes a knee,
stretching in to unlatch the glove box.

He pockets the CELL PHONE, draws a breath and POPS THE TRUNK.

EXT. BONNEVILE - SECLUDED AREA - EARLY MORNING 180

Dwight scurries to the trunk as it’s pushed up by Teddy,
emerging disoriented in a sheen of filth and sweat.

DWIGHT
Stay in the trunk.

Teddy swallows air, squinting in the daylight, seeing the
rifle trained on his chest.

TEDDY
(hoarse)
That's easy, my leg is broke.

Dwight stands mute, the bottle of water by his feet.
TEDDY (CONT'D)
(weakly snapping his
finger)
That for me?

Dwight wiggles a firmer grip around the rifle.

DWIGHT

Were you coming for me or for her?
TEDDY

Who?
DWIGHT

You came to my sister's house. Who
were you coming for?

TEDDY
Look, man. You.

DWIGHT
Then how come you didn’t just call
the police? Send me to jail?

TEDDY
Same as you. Keeping it ‘in-house’.

Dwight tosses the water bottle, TEDDY snatches it from the
air, uncaps it and chugs...
64.
DWIGHT
What if I surrender?

Teddy raises his eyebrows, chugging. He empties the bottle
and tosses it to the ground.

TEDDY
(ecstatic breath)
I accept.
DWIGHT

Please, dammit. To the police- I'll
plead guilty.

TEDDY
You don’t get to do what you did
and just lock yourself up. Shit,
I'd give you props if he wasn’t my
brother. Or if he had it coming.

DWIGHT
If Wade didn’t deserve it, then
nobody ever has.
Teddy rubs his face, looks off.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
Which one are you, again?

TEDDY
Teddy.

DWIGHT
And who was the boy in the
limousine?

TEDDY
You totaled it. That’s my
livelihood...

Dwight waits patiently for the answer.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
Just a boy. Not a concern.

DWIGHT
When I let him out, he said
something about Wade. That he
didn’t hurt anyone...

TEDDY
Yeah, well-
(chuckling)
Coupla dead negroes might disagree.
(MORE )
65.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
(unsmiling)

He just meant Wade didn’t kill your

parents.

DWIGHT
Not true.

TEDDY
Well that settles it, then.

Dwight anxiously finds a new stance, flushing red.

TEDDY (CONT'D)

That’s how this works, man. The one
with the gun gets to tell the
truth. Problem is, you don’t know
shit.

DWIGHT
Tell me.

TEDDY
(quiet, taunting)
I should’ve done the time.

DWIGHT
(raising the rifle)
Are you saying you killed them?

TEDDY
Nope.

DWIGHT
Forget this.

Dwight CLICKS THE SAFETY, taking aim at Teddy’s arm.
TEDDY
(flinching, blurting)
What‘er you tryin’ to do?! WHAT’ER
YOU TRYIN’ TO DO!?
DWIGHT SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER - PANG! - AND MISSES.
TEDDY (CONT'D)
(exhilarated)
HOT DAMN! Fish in a barrel!

DWIGHT
STOP IT!

Teddy settles, suppressing a smug grin.
66.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
Whatever you're saying, say it.

TEDDY
I didn’t do it. Wade didn’t do it.
Our father, Big Wade, shot your
dad. As was his right.

DWIGHT
His right?

TEDDY
You don’t fuck with a man’s wife.
His family.

DWIGHT
Whatever my dad did, he did with
your mom. They made a mistake.
Togeth-

TEDDY
SHIT’S NOT A MISTAKE.

DWIGHT
Whatever it was, both my parents
are dead-

TEDDY
Your dad got what he deserved. Your
mom was just in the car- that was a
fuckup. I’1l give you that...

DWIGHT
I don’t want your opinion on
things. If it’s true about Wade-
why did he...?

TEDDY
Big Wade had cancer. We couldn’t
let him die in prison. I would've
done the time, but I had two
strikes. Would’ve been life with no
parole. Little Wade could take a
plea... You smoke?

Teddy watches intently as Dwight, lost in thought, lets the
rifle barrel drift downward. Dwight pulls out the CELL PHONE.

DWIGHT
Call them.

TEDDY
Who’s them? The cops?
67.

DWIGHT
Your family.

Teddy gestures for the phone. Dwight cautiously lobs it over,
Teddy catches it and checks the screen.

TEDDY
What do you want me to say?

DWIGHT
We're all going to meet up-
somewhere public- and it’s going to

end.
TEDDY
Okay.
He dials and waits.
DWIGHT

Don’t say my name and don’t say
anything about a gun. We’re in
Kentucky.

TEDDY
(surveying)
You ever been to Kentucky?

Dwight blinks, re-focusing down the rifle sights.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
(into cell phone)
It’s me. Call me back. NOW.
(to Dwight)
Not picking up. May I call the
house?

Dwight nods his approval. Teddy dials and waits.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Hey. Yeah- shut up. I’m fine...just
my leg. I’m with him, he’s here.
Not now, he wants to meet- fine.
I'll try, but we just went through

it.
(to Dwight)
She wants to talk to you.
DWIGHT
Who?
TEDDY

My sister. She’s bossy...
68.

DWIGHT
Throw it.

Teddy pivots the phone in his hand, tweaking its position.

TEDDY
I would- the signal’s weak. We
can’t blow this- just take it...

He extends the phone with one hand.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
It’s fine. You can point that thing
right at my face. I’m not moving.

DWIGHT
Turn around. Look away.

Teddy shifts his weight around, looking back into the trunk.

TEDDY
Keep your finger on the trigger...

Dwight approaches, two hands gripping the rifle, pointing it
directly at the back of Teddy's head.

TEDDY (CONT'D)

It’s over as far as I’m concerned.
(towards the phone)

You hear that, sis?

Dwight reaches for the phone, steps on the discarded water
bottle. CRUNCH.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
.--don’t go starting ANY SHIT-

TEDDY WHIPS FROM HIS CORE, ARMS SWEEPING BROADLY AROUND,
DEFLECTING THE GUN BARREL AS DWIGHT FIRES INTO THE TRUNK.

PATANG! TEDDY LAUNCHES FROM THE TRUNK AND TACKLES DWIGHT TO
THE GROUND, ELBOWING HIM HARD TO THE FACE.

Teddy snatches the gun and SLAMS THE PHONE INTO DWIGHT’S
STUNNED FACE.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
THERE’S NOBODY HOME, STUPID FUCK!
They’re huntin’...

He backs off fast, rising with the gun.
69.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
YES. FUCK! My fucking legs are
asleep...

Teddy wobbles back to the rear bumper and sits. He pulls the
slide handle and ejects a cartridge. Dwight grimaces, his jaw
trembling...

DWIGHT
I'll die. I should. But my sister
never did anything. Just tell me...

TEDDY
You bet. I got the gun, you get the
truth. But not to satisfy your
fucking curiosity, Dwight.

Teddy rises and hovers over Dwight with a cold stare.

TEDDY (CONT'D)
Just know that the man who killed
your parents didn’t die by your
hands. He smoked and he drank and
he- guess he didn’t fuck cuz of the
cancer- but he watched all his
favorite TV shows and he died a
free man. You'll die like your
whore father did... ...Shot in the
fucking face. Or first do you wanna
open up that belly? See your guts
steam?

Teddy raises the M-14 barrel to Dwight’s stomach.
Dwight drowns in dread.
TEDDY (CONT'D)
Must have a little in there since
you took Wade from us.
(quiet, sinister)

And for that, your sister and tho-
SWIP. THE AIR BETWEEN THEM IS DISTURBED VIOLENTLY.
Dwight and Teddy share confusion.
KOOSH. A distant thundering sound.

Teddy looks to the far tree line, searching.

Dwight looks to Teddy as HIS HEAD SMACKS APART AT THE BASE OF
THE NECK AND JAW.
70.

KOOSH. Another thundering sound as Teddy’s body collapses to
the side.

DWIGHT
-.-wait.

Dwight sits up, face smattered with blood, finding where
Teddy's eyes were trained.

BEN IS WALKING BRISKLY ACROSS THE FIELD AIMING HIS MOSIN BOLT-
ACTION RIFLE. Wearing camouflage hunting overalls, he ejects
a shell and loads the chamber.

BEN
(echoing across the field)
JUST THE ONE?

Dwight nods ‘yes’, his chest heaving. Ben is too far for
subtle gestures.

DWIGHT
(echoing back)
YES.

Ben safeties his weapon, still bridging the distance.

BEN
SORRY. COULDN'T SHOOT ‘TILL HE
AIMED AT YOU. HAD TO BE LEGAL- ON
MY END AT LEAST.

Ben reaches the clearing, pulls the clip and sets the Mosin
on the picnic table.

DWIGHT
His head...

BEN
That’s what bullets do.

Dwight watches in awe as Ben scoops the Mini-14 from the
ground, pops the clip and safeties it beside the Mosin.

BEN (CONT'D)

Jesus man, I am not impressed. Told
you to keep your distance- you
missed from two yards?

Ben grabs Teddy’s corpse under the armpits, waits for Dwight.
BEN (CONT'D)

Let’s go man. I’d like him off my
property. C’mon.
71.
Dwight dusts off and grabs the corpse by the ankles. They
lift and carry.

BEN (CONT'D)
This Wade Cleland?

DWIGHT
(straining)
His older brother. Wade’s already
dead.
BEN

(noticing the blood)
Wipe your face off. He’s probably
got hepatitis.

They drop the body in the open trunk.

BEN (CONT'D)
(re: Teddy’s cell phone)
Pick that up, throw it in here.

Dwight does as he’s told.

BEN (CONT'D)

Don’t forget to wipe it down before
you get rid of it. You got the
keys?

Dwight checks his pockets and nods ‘yes’.

BEN (CONT'D)
Show ‘em to me.

Dwight presents the keys. Ben shuts the trunk firmly.

DWIGHT
(pointing)
What about the rest of his head?

There’s BRAIN TISSUE AND CARTILAGE in the nearby grass.

BEN
Coyotes will get that.
(second look)
Long as there’s no teeth...

DWIGHT
(wiping face with shirt)
They won’t let it end. Not now.

BEN
Yeah, well. I’m switching you to
buckshot.
181

72.

EXT. SECLUDED AREA - BEN’S PROPERTY - LATER 181
A CRUDE STACK OF JUGS AND CRATES BLOWS APART.
Dwight FIRES a CIRCUIT JUDGE REVOLVING RIFLE.

He lowers the barrel, pops the cylinder and tosses the spent
shells, looking to Ben.

BEN
It’s doesn’t have the stopping
power of a twelve gauge- but you
seem comfortable with it.

Dwight nods, drifting.
Ben swaps guns as Dwight TUNES OUT.

BEN (CONT'D)
Shoots slugs too- but you wouldn’t
hit anything. Only five shots
though, so the Steyr is your secondary-
backup. Another eight rounds, and stopping power-

Ben steps to Dwight until his wandering eyes make contact.

BEN (CONT'D)
This is personal, I know. But
that’s how you’ll fail. No talking.
No speeches. If you point the gun,
you shoot the gun.

Dwight nods.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - BEN’S HOUSE - DAY 182
Dwight and Ben load the guns and a pack in the Bonneville.

BEN
This should do you.

DWIGHT
Where’s the closest car repair?

BEN
Well, once you're back to the main
road- closest one’s about 20 miles.
But that’s east. I assume you’re
heading west. It’s just a gas
station, though- watcha need?
183

184

73.

DWIGHT
It‘ll be fine. But do you have some
food I could take?
(holding his belly)
Think I’m going to pass out...

BEN
Yeah, man.

Dwight watches Ben double time it to the house.

INT. KITCHEN - BEN’S HOUSE - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 183
Ben piles SNACKS from cabinets into a SHOPPING BAG. From a
pantry he pulls packets of VACUUM SEALED FOOD.

EXT. BEN’S HOUSE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 184

Dwight shuts the Bonneville’s door and turns to Ben,
approaching with the grocery bag.

BEN
Threw a few MREs in there.

Dwight accepts the bag and hands Ben the OLD YEARBOOK.
BEN (CONT'D)

(flipping through)
Nice! I lost mine, or shot it up...

DWIGHT
I wish I didn’t bring all this to
you.

BEN

(closing yearbook)
It’s come and gone. Plus, I’m glad
you did. You'd be dead otherwise.

DWIGHT
You know what I mean.

BEN
If it were my family, I might do
the same. I don’t know. But I’m not
helping ‘cus this is right. This is
ugly, man.

The two stand in silence, acknowledging the weight.
185

186

187

74.

DWIGHT
Hey. If you ever do come across
that Polaroid- of us with the
stripper-
Ben smiles.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
Do me a favor?

BEN
Yeah?

DWIGHT
Destroy it?

Ben’s smile fades.
BEN
Okay.
INT. BONNEVILLE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY 185

Dwight drives west, squinting peacefully into the sun, wind
from open windows scattering his hair.

ON THE RADIO: He powers it up and SCANS STATIONS.
A LOCAL OLDIES STATION CRACKLES THROUGH THE SPEAKERS.

ON THE BACK SEAT FLOOR: WIND WHIPS A CANVAS TARP OFF THE
GUNS.

CLOSE UP: TRACKING ALONG THE RIFLE BARREL, THE TARP FLAPPING
LOOSE, REVEALING A HEAVY DUTY CAR BATTERY.

CUT TO:

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - BEN’S HOUSE - DAY 186

The truck cab is packed with HUNTING GEAR. Ben tucks TWO
RIFLE CASES behind the seats and turns the ignition.

THE ENGINE DOESN’T TURN OVER, NOT EVEN A CLICK.

He pulls the hood latch and hops out.

EXT. PICKUP TRUCK - BEN’S HOUSE - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 187

STEAK and a GLASS OF RED WINE.

INT. BEDROOM - BEN’S HOUSE - DAY 190

Ben returns RIFLES to their locker, looks off...

INT. BONNEVILLE (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DAY 191
THE OLDIES SONG SURGES.

Back on the road, Dwight heads into the horizon.

INT. KITCHEN - BEN’S HOUSE - DAY 192
FLASHES OF BLINDING BLUE LIGHT WITH MELTING, BUBBLING LAYERS.
It’s a POLAROID PICTURE BURNING IN A MICROWAVE.

Ben leans against the kitchen counter, watching the show with
a TALL-BOY in hand.

He drinks.

INT. BONNEVILLE - WOODS- AFTERNOON 198
Dwight darkens. He cuts the engine.

FROM THE BACK SEAT: Dwight opens the rear door and gathers
his WEAPONS.

ON THE KEYS, STILL DANGLING IN THE IGNITION, as Dwight shuts
the door and passes the window. He places a FALLEN BRANCH
against the car, shading the interior. Then another.

EXT. FRONT GATE - CLELAND PROPERTY - AFTERNOON 199

A narrow, rutted road leads to a weathered brick entrance
with an iron gate secured by a HEAVY CHAIN and PADLOCK.

A worn, hand painted PLAQUE reads: ‘CLELAND’

EXT. FENCE - CLELAND PROPERTY - AFTERNOON 200
Dwight slides the Circuit Judge rifle and the Steyr pistol
under a low, twisted fence. He tosses his backpack over and
straddles the sagging wire, rolling over and off...

EXT. TREE LINE - AFTERNOON 202
Dwight crouches, getting the lay of the land.

A rustic single story house sits in a half acre clearing. A
two-car garage lies beyond, its doors obstructed by a BOAT
TRAILER parked on sunken concrete.

Four generation’s worth of ARTIFACTS clutter the property.

EXT. CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 203

WIDE, FROM AFAR, Dwight starts towards the quiet house.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 204

Dwight rounds the back with trained eyes, moving past an old
TOW TRUCK, its load covered in BLUE TARP.

THE BACK SCREEN DOOR, FRAMED IN WOOD. Dwight leans close,
listening inside.

He cracks it open, turning the interior door handle. LOCKED.

EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 205
Dwight hugs the mossy siding, ducking under a window.

He sets the rifle down, cupping the glass for a view.

EXT. CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 206
Dwight stalks towards the front door.

A DISTANT NOISE. He pivots to the woods and listens.

INT. CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 207
THROUGH A WINDOW, Dwight appears, squinting into the dark
interior cast in green from surrounding foliage.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 208
Dwight opens the back screen door, widens his stance and

VIOLENTLY KICKS THE INTERIOR DOOR. The screen SMACKS his back
with each LOUD IMPACT.
209

78.
The door holds firm. Spooked by his failed breach, Dwight
clears out, the screen door SLAMMING behind him.

He scampers behind the tow truck and readies the rifle, his
grip arm resting on a fender.

RIFLE SIGHTS ON THE BACK DOOR...
Nobody comes.

He turns to the tarp behind the truck, weighted by a CINDER
BLOCK. He kicks it over and lifts the tarp.

UNDER THE TARP: The WHITE LIMOUSINE wreckage, scorched and
half-cannibalized.

THUNK. Dwight plants the CINDER BLOCK, propping open the
screen door. He leans the rifle by the frame and backs off.

With a running start, Dwight delivers a POWERFUL KICK.

The INTERIOR DOOR CAVES INWARD SEVERAL INCHES and the frame
comes loose.

He backs up further and runs...

INT. CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON (CONTINUOUS) 209
THE BACK DOOR SMASHES OPEN AND THE FRAME GIVES.

The rifle barrel pushes inside, Dwight guiding it.

HAND HELD WITH DWIGHT AS HE SEARCHES:

DOWN A HALLWAY. It’s musty and dark, THICK DRAPES block the
daylight.

THROUGH THE NARROW KITCHEN with JUNK FOOD WRAPPERS and dated
appliances.

INTO THE DINING AREA with an oval TABLE, three ASHTRAYS,
chairs piled with NEWSPAPERS and a wood laminate CREDENZA.

THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM, past a feline SCRATCHING POST, a
corduroy COUCH, COFFEE TABLE, RECLINER and an oversized
projection TV.

INTO THE MASTER BEDROOM with a QUEEN BED, STUFFED ANIMALS and
a COT.

BACK OUT AND DOWN A HALLWAY, ducking in and out of a
BATHROOM, past an IRONING BOARD against the wall.
210

211

212

213

79.
INTO A SECOND BEDROOM with two DOUBLE BEDS, a small
TELEVISION and a GAME CONSOLE...
AND BACK INTO THE HALLWAY- the full tour. Dwight lowers the
rifle in the light of the doorway.
EXT. GARAGE - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 210
DWIGHT CRASHES THE RIFLE BUTT THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE SIDE
DOOR. He reaches in, unlatching the dead bolt.
INT. GARAGE - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 211

Dwight moves through a mudroom stacked with BOXES, swinging
his rifle into the garage.

Scattered LIMOUSINE PARTS, TOOLS, a REFRIGERATOR, and a full
sized MATTRESS and BOX SPRING.

BLOOD SPLATTER above the baseboard bleeds through FRESH WALL
PAINT. On the floor lies a ROLLER, an ALUMINUM TRAY and a CAN
OF WHITE PAINT.

ON DWIGHT, turning to the near wall...

OVER HIS SHOULDER: HALF A DOZEN RIFLES ON RACKS, encased in
the glass of an ANTIQUE CABINET.

There are TWO EMPTY RACKS IN THE CASE.

His shoulders sink, gazing at the arsenal before him.
He turns a KEY in the lock and the door drifts open.
He turns to the bed.

Atop a MILK CRATE ‘end table’ are scraps of TIN-FOIL, BOTTLE
CAPS and a cloudy GLASS PIPE.

Dwight PULLS THE TOP SHEET FROM THE MATTRESS.

EXT. GARAGE - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 212
Dwight backs out the side door dragging the bedsheet, the
CLATTERING guns wrapped inside.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 213

Dwight opens the drapes, cross-lighting stagnant dust.
80.

He unhooks THREE ANTIQUE RIFLES hanging above the television.
He runs his hands under the couch.

He pulls open a side table drawer.

With a knee to the floor, he searches the credenza.

He stands, noticing a BLINKING ANSWERING MACHINE on top.
He hits ‘PLAY’.

CHRIS (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Teddy, check in. We took the truck.
Headed to the shore, left you the
map and your charger. William is
with Sherri. She is not happy about
all this. Might need to do
something about her too. This is a
fucking mess. Erase this if you get
it. We’ll pick William up on the
way back. Should be there Thursday
night. I hope to God you're not
dead. Erase this if you get it.

BEEP.

Dwight finds the PHONE CHARGER and MAP on the dining table.
It’s his map from the Bonneville, with a line from Delaware
to Virginia.

TEDDY & DWIGHT (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)

(muffled, wind whipped)
TEDDY: ...he’s here. No. Listen. Not now,
he wants to meet- fine. I’1ll try, but
we've already been through it. She wants
to talk to you.
DWIGHT: Who?
TEDDY: My sister. She’s bossy...
DWIGHT: Throw it...
TEDDY: Shit. The signal’s weak. I don’t
want to blow this- just take it. It’s
fine. You can point that thing right at
my face. I’m not moving.
DWIGHT: Turn around. Look away.
TEDDY: Keep your finger on the trigger...
It’s over as far as I’m concerned. You
hear that, sis? Don’t go starting ANY
SHIT- AN OVERMODULATED SCUFFLE
TEDDY: THERE’S NOBODY HOME, STUPID FUCK!

TEDDY (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Hey, when you’re home stay there.
Had to swap out a tire to tow her

And keep Carl in check.

BEEP.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 214
Dwight circles the bed, checking under the mattress.

FEMALE VOICE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Hello. This is officer Downey with
Community Corrections calling to

He slides open a bedside drawer and removes a NICKEL PLATED
REVOLVER. He tests the weight and tucks it in his belt.

The other an AIR MATTRESS with pressed sheets and a CARTON OF
CIGARETTES by the pillow.
CARL (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Pick up. Pick up! She was not there-

Dwight’s eyes settle on a HOMEMADE BANNER draped above the
door frame with letters drawn in marker: ‘Welcome Home

EXT. BACKYARD - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 216

The bedsheet lies open by the back door. Dwight tosses the
hung antiques onto the HEAP OF GUNS.

EXT. HILL - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 217

Dwight drags the bedsheet down an incline, coming upon a low,
rusted gate bordering a CRUDE GRAVE SITE.

LIMESTONE MEMORIALS, GRANITE HEADSTONES and SLABS OF SLATE
sit shaded by a tree, crooked from its roots.

Near the edge, FRESHLY CHURNED DIRT with DRIED WILD FLOWERS
and a LIQUOR BOTTLE in place of a stone.

EXT. WOODS - CLELAND PROPERTY - LATE AFTERNOON 218
Dwight shovels dirt under a canopy of trees.

He pulls the bedsheet of guns into the ditch and fills it in.

He walks over loose dirt, packing it down.

INT. KITCHEN - CLELAND HOME - LATE AFTERNOON 219

Glistening with muddy sweat, Dwight pulls a cup from a
cabinet, filling it from the tap and chugging water.

He refills it.

EXT. GRAVE SITE - CLELAND HOME - LATE AFTERNOON 220

ON THE FRESH GRAVE, PUSHING PAST IT, MOVING TOWARDS A GRANITE
HEADSTONE: ‘WADE MARSHAL CLELAND SR.’

Urine desecrates the grave. A healthy amount of it.

INT. LIVING ROOM HALLWAY - CLELAND HOME - EVENING 221

ON THE WELCOME MAT, Dwight props a GLASS JAR of coins, tacks
and hardware against the front door.

He takes shelter behind a PILED FURNITURE BUNKER, bracing
against the wall, his rifle barrel resting on a couch pillow.

Dwight waits patiently in the dark.

EXT. CLELAND HOME - NIGHT 222
The BUSY DRONE of night creatures.

PUSHING IN ON THE PITCH BLACK HOUSE.

INT. LIVING ROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT 223
Dwight’s heavy, drifting eyes.

HUM...TICK - THE LIVING ROOM LAMP THROWS WARM LIGHT AND DEEP
SHADOWS IN EVERY DIRECTION.

Dwight springs up with his weight against the wall.

His eyes sharpen, his breaths ease- in through the nose, out
through the mouth. The rifle is trained steadily on the door.

He hunts for a trace of sound or motion.
But there is none.
He steps in for a better angle of view. Still no trace.

He ducks past the window and drops down.

INT. KITCHEN - CLELAND HOME - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 224

Dwight crawls through the kitchen and out the back door.

84.

EXT. CLELAND HOME - NIGHT 225

Dwight jogs in a crouch around the house, sweeping with his
eyes through the rifle sights.

He lines-up the front porch. Nothing but night.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLELAND HOME - NIGHT 226
Dwight enters from the kitchen, approaching the PHANTOM LAMP.
He drops to all fours and traces the lamp cord to an OUTLET.
Between the plug and socket is a SMALL BEIGE DEVICE, like a
thermostat, but marked with hours instead of degrees. Written
in brown font:

‘Intermatic TIME-ALL’ It’s set for 9PM.

From his low vantage point, Dwight notices a stack of BOOKS
under the coffee table.

He pulls out two dusty vinyl PHOTO ALBUMS.

He cocks his head and listens. Then settles on the floor
against the recliner and flips through...

THE PHOTO ALBUM:

A photo timeline of the Clelands. Vintage black and whites,
faded color prints and stained Polaroids. From stoic,
depression era hunters to Teddy and his limousines.

Pelts and guns.

A man and a woman.

The man sick. The woman pregnant.

The woman with a baby, others wear black.

A young boy beside a slain deer, with indifferent eyes...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLELAND HOME - EARLY MORNING 227
Dwight sits asleep on the floor against the recliner, the
album across his lap. The lamp’s warm glow clashes against
the morning blue.

HUM...TICK. The lamp turns off.

Dwight wakes in the cold light.

INT. 2ND BEDROOM - CLELAND HOME - MORNING 228
Dwight pulls the bedsheet off the air mattress, sets the
cigarette carton back on top.

EXT. WOODS - CLELAND PROPERTY - MORNING 229
TRACKING WITH DWIGHT, back through the woods, the sheet over
his shoulder.

EXT. BONNEVILLE - WOODS - MORNING 230
PUSHING IN ON THE BONNEVILLE, half camouflaged with branches.

ON THE TRUNK as it unlatches and bobs. Dwight lifts it open,
wincing at the escaping smell.

He spreads the bedsheet on the ground, holds his breath and
lunges into the trunk, grappling with TEDDY'S BODY until it
slumps over the edge and onto the sheet.

Dwight gasps upward for air, pockets Teddy’s CELL PHONE and
shuts the trunk.

He wraps the body.

EXT. FENCE - CLELAND PROPERTY - MORNING 231
Dwight struggles with THE BODY, caught in the fence by its
own weight.

EXT. WOODS - CLELAND PROPERTY - LATE MORNING 232

Dwight drags THE BODY by the bedsheet, torn and muddy with
blood pooling at one end.

He’s exhausted, sweating profusely.

EXT. GRAVE SITE - CLELAND HOME - DAY 233
ON DWIGHT’S FACE, as he shovels dirt.
ON THE GRAVE he’s digging, by the edge of the gated plot.

WIDER, Dwight stands in the ditch, hips at ground level. He
pulls THE BODY into the grave.

ON DWIGHT’S FACE, as he shovels.

A MUFFLED PULSE stops him mid swing.

AGAIN, clearly now- A TELEPHONE RING.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLELAND HOME - DAY 234

ON THE PHONE. Dwight stomps to a halt, catching his breath as
the ANSWERING MACHINE ENGAGES.

TEDDY'S VOICE (V.O.)
(answering machine)
You've reached the Cleland
residence- drop it like it’s hot.
BEEP. DEAD AIR.
FOUR NUMERIC TONES. Dwight tenses.
ANSWERING MACHINE
(electronic menu voice)
You have-no-new messages. You have-
five-saved mes-
THREE NUMERIC TONES. Dwight steps closer with wide eyes.
ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT’D)
(electronic menu voice)
You have-no-messages.
A SUSTAINED DIAL TONE...
CLICK. Dwight stares, shaken.

He fishes in his pocket, sets Teddy’s phone on the dining
table and plugs in the charger.

Fumbling with the power connector, Dwight scowls until the
phone CHIRPS AFFIRMATIVE.

EXT. GRAVE SITE - DAY 235
Dwight wiggles a SLAB OF ROCK flush with the dirt.

He PAINTS ‘TEDDY’ on it with the roller and tray.

INT. LIVING ROOM HALLWAY - CLELAND HOME - DAY 236

Dwight swings his rifle in the hallway, testing the width.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM —- CLELAND HOME - DAY 237

Dwight shuts the closet door and pinches the drapes, reaching
through them to open the bottom window pane.

He kneels behind the bed.

RIFLE SIGHTS THROUGH THE DOOR, INTO THE LIVING ROOM HALL.

INT. 2ND BEDROOM - CLELAND HOME - DAY 238
Dwight closes the drapes and turns on a table lamp, leaving
the door slightly ajar.

INT. HALLWAY - CLELAND HOME - DAY 239
Dwight steps to the ironing board against the wall. He moves
it aside and discovers a narrow doorway into a utility area.
INT. UTILITY AREA - CLELAND HOME - DAY 240
Dwight enters the dark and pulls a hanging chain. A
fluorescent light warms up, flickering above a compact
washing machine and utility sink. DRIED BLOOD coats the sink

rim, a bag of soiled clothes sits on the washer.

A silver CHARM NECKLACE dangles from a wire shelf.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 241

ON THE CELLPHONE, atop the dining table. It CHIRPS again, the
charger unplugged. Dwight rises behind it.

He disconnects the phone and arranges the charger on the
table as he found it beside the map.

He dials a number on Teddy’s cell phone, referring to a LABEL
on the house phone.

He waits. The house phone RINGS...

The answering machine CLICKS AND SPEWS SHRILL AUDIO FEEDBACK.

EXT. BACK YARD - CLELAND HOME - AFTERNOON 242

Dwight stands thirty feet from the house, the phone pressed
to his ear, waiting for a BEEP.

Hello. It’s me...
INT. LIVING ROOM - CLELAND HOME - EVENING 243
ON THE WELCOME MAT: Dwight removes the GLASS JAR from against
the door.
INT. LIVING ROOM HALLWAY - CLELAND HOME - EVENING 244
LOW, BROODING STRINGS.
The furniture bunker is gone. Dwight tucks to the wall and
sinks to the floor, the rifle in his lap.
EXT. CLELAND HOME - EVENING 245

FIREFLIES BLINK in the brush as the house darkens.

EXT. WOODS - CLELAND PROPERTY - EVENING 246
The night sky envelopes the surrounding woods.

THE LOW STRINGS BUILD.

EXT. WOODS - CLELAND PROPERTY - NIGHT 247

Black trees sway.

EXT. FRONT GATE - CLELAND PROPERTY - NIGHT 248

Through the rusted gate, HEADLIGHTS APPEAR around a bend and
skip off the dirt.

THE STRINGS INTENSIFY.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLELAND HOME - NIGHT 249

EXTREME CLOSE-UP, THE INTERNAL MECHANISM OF A LOW TECH
ELECTRONIC DEVICE. ROTATING PLASTIC AROUND SIMPLE WIRING.

A FAMILIAR BUZZ...CLICK.
The PHANTOM LAMP illuminates.

DOWN THE HALL, Dwight waits.
89.

The distant CLINK OF A GATE. The RUMBLE OF TIRES.

Dwight brings his knees to his chest, his feet flat against
the carpet.

He pulls out Teddy’s cell phone, presses a button and waits.
OUTSIDE, A VEHICLE PULLS UP.
Dwight backs into the dark, pressing another button.
THE HOUSE PHONE RINGS.
MUFFLED VOICES OUTSIDE. RUNNING FEET.
CHRIS (0.S.)
(through door)
It’s the phone!
CARL (0.S.)
(through door)
Move!
KEYS CLANK AGAINST THE DOOR.
THE DOOR LATCHES OPEN: CARL, CHRIS, AND HOPE BURST THROUGH...

ON DWIGHT, shadowed out of view, quietly closing the phone
and slipping it away.

THE RINGING STOPS as the trio reaches the phone.

CARL (CONT'D)

Fuck!
CHRIS
There’s a message!
HOPE
Go. Play it!

Chris presses ‘PLAY’.

ON DWIGHT, DOWN THE HALLWAY, dripping sweat. He raises the
Circuit Judge Rifle, finds a firm grip.

Chris, Hope and Carl gather around the table, listening
intently to the message.

THEY’RE ALL IN HIS SIGHTS.

CLICK. BEEP.
90.

DWIGHT’S VOICE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Hello. It’s me. Dwight Evans...

CARL
MOTHER FUCKER!

HOPE
Shut the fuck up!

DWIGHT (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Wade is dead. Teddy is dead too. He
told me everything. I think.

Chris weeps. Carl BLURTS but Hope SLAPS him quiet.

DWIGHT’S VOICE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
I didn’t kill him- well, I guess I
did. It doesn’t matter. By my count
that’s two of yours and two of
mine. I don’t know how this ends,
but I'd like it to, uh...
Or it can keep going. I just need
my sister to be left out if this-

CARL
(erupting)
THAT’S WHY WE’RE GOING TO
PITTSBURGH YOU SONA-

BOOM! CARL’S CHEST POPS OPEN, SPLATTERING BLOOD ON THE
ANSWERING MACHINE AND ACROSS THE DINING AREA.

Carl keels over YELLING THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH as Dwight
steps from the shadows.

HOPE
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?!!

CHRIS
THAT’S HIM!

DWIGHT’S VOICE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
I have Teddy’s phone.

Dwight aims and fires. BOOM.

A MISS. The bulk of the buckshot SPLINTERS THE TABLE, some of
it GRAZES HOPE, HER SLEEVE TEARING WITH BLOODY MIST.

DWIGHT
(quick, instinctual)
Sorry.

HE CHECKS HIS AIM AND BLOWS ANOTHER HOLE IN CARL’S SIDE.
91.
HOPE
WE’RE GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU!
DWIGHT’S VOICE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
You'll find his body in the yard
with some family.

Dwight nods, showing teeth. Carl slumps in the corner.

DWIGHT
Wish you woulda...

He aims, alternating between Chris and Hope.
DWIGHT’S VOICE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Call it if you want to talk this
through...
Tears flow down Dwight’s flushed face.
DWIGHT
(trembling)
You people...

DWIGHT’S VOICE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Sorry to bother you at home.

CLICK. BEEP.
Chris looks to the wall above the television.

DWIGHT
Guns are gone. Buried them.

He shows the nickel plated revolver tucked in his belt.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
This one too.

Chris looks to the RECLINER.

Hope turns her head ever so slightly, eyes drifting to the
front door:

THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR: OUT OF DWIGHT’S VIEW STANDS THE BOY,
grasping his hand held video game console. He creeps backward
towards the PARKED TRUCK.

CHRIS (0.S.)
Don’t shoot us.

DWIGHT (0.S.)
I've been here a while. Waiting.
92.
The Boy delicately opens the cab door and removes a DOUBLE
BARRELED SHOTGUN from a GUN RACK.
DWIGHT (CONT'D)

Trying to think of reasons not to

do this- to end your family.

There’s a thousand. But there’s one

why I should.

HOPE
Fine. We'll leave her out.

Dwight looks up from his sights.

DWIGHT
How ca-—

BOOM. DWIGHT IS THROWN BACK SEVERAL FEET BY THE IMPACT FROM
THE SHOTGUN BLAST, HIS RIFLE DROPS TO THE GROUND.

Dwight defiantly attempts to stand, bleeding from his ribs.

HOPE
GO! BLOW HIS HEAD OFF!

The Young Boy walks in closer as Dwight staggers to his feet.

CHRIS
KILL HIM, WILLIAM.
HOPE
(to Dwight)

Your whole family will die...

The Young Boy, William, shakes his head ‘no’ as Chris steps
towards the door.

WILLIAM
(crying, still walking)
I don’t want to.
As William approaches, Dwight grabs the Circuit Judge from
the floor and swings it like a sword, sweeping and SMACKING
THE BARREL OF WILLIAM’S SHOTGUN. BOOM.
PLASTER FROM THE CEILING RAINS DOWN ON DWIGHT AND WILLIAM.

Chris reaches the recliner in a crouch as Dwight puts her in
his sights.

DWIGHT
STOP.

Chris stands slowly.
93.

Hope holds her bleeding arm, exuding pure hatred.
William stands stunned with a loose grip on the shotgun.
ON THE SHOTGUN: TWO SMOKING BARRELS, TWO TRIGGERS.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)

(calmly, to William)
I don’t know much about guns. But I
think I have more bullets than you.

HOPE
DON'T KILL HIM.

DWIGHT
(to Hope)
If he dies tonight, your father
killed him. Your father killed
everyone here.

Dwight lifts his shirt, exposing the GUSHING HOLE IN HIS
SIDE.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
(calmly, to William)
I think you did your job, William.
I still gotta finish up, though.
Fast, I think.

William looks around the room. Dread everywhere.
Settling into shock, Dwight watches his shotgun wound bleed.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
It’s funny- hurts less than
the...uh, arrow...

Hope Nods to William. He backs towards the door.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
(calmly, to William)
Leave the gun. You can just wipe it
off... My car is down the road, off
in the woods a little. It’s dark
though.

Chris nervously shifts her weight as William runs past and
out the door, gun still in hand.

Dwight, Hope and Chris stand listening to the PAT OF WILLIAMS
FEET AGAINST THE DIRT ROAD.

Until they stand in silence.
94.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
He’s my Father’s son?

Chris and Hope find each other’s eyes.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
Teddy told me about the cancer. Big
Wade.

CHRIS
(quiet, furious)
Don’t you mention their names.

Dwight pulls out the nickel plated revolver and sets it on
the window ledge to his side.

DWIGHT
You know what’s awful?

He raises the Circuit Judge.
DWIGHT (CONT'D)
Just because my Dad and your Mom
loved each other? We all end up
dead...
Eyes glistening, lip trembling, DWIGHT LOWERS THE BARREL.

CHRIS DIVES FOR THE RECLINER, SLAPS THE WOODEN LEVER ON THE
SIDE, EXTENDING THE FOOT REST.

HOPE
AHHHHHHHH!

HOPE CHARGES DWIGHT. DWIGHT AIMS AND FIRES.

BOOM. HOPE’S LEG SPEWS BLOODY CHUNKS- IT DOESN’T SLOW HER
DOWN ONE BIT.

UNDERNEATH THE RECLINER’S EXTENDED FOOTREST: A HOMEMADE
WOODEN GUN COMPARTMENT REINFORCED WITH DUCT TAPE: CHRIS PULLS
OUT A TEC-9 MACHINE PISTOL, UNLOADING THE 30 ROUND CLIP AT
DWIGHT. PTRDDDDDDDDDDDD....

ON DWIGHT, RATHER CALM. AIMING...

THE FURNITURE AND WOOD PANELED WALLS BEHIND HIM ARE RIDDLED
WITH BULLETS AS HOPE FLAILS CLOSER.

DWIGHT BLASTS A HOLE IN CHRIS’ SHOULDER, SHATTERING THE LAMP
BY THE DOOR.

ILLUMINATED BY RAPID GUNFIRE: THE BULLET SPRAY FROM CHRIS’
TEC-9 RIPS APART HOPE’S BACK AS SHE REACHES DWIGHT.

ON DWIGHT, CALMLY FIRING.

EXT. CLELAND HOME - NIGHT 250
William watches from the dark woods holding the shotgun.

The Cleland home is ABLAZE IN GUNFIRE.

Within seconds, it falls QUIET.

William turns to the front gate, tossing the shotgun before
disappearing into the darkness.

Just the DRONE OF THOSE BUSY NIGHT CREATURES.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLELAND HOME - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 251
The DRONE carries inside.
The room is A DARK, BLOODY MESS.

CLOSE ON DWIGHT. He sets his chin atop the window sill,
unable to focus his gaze beyond the glass pane.

WITH HEAVY BREATH, he tucks his neck until his forehead rests
on the sill and his eyes stare down at the shag carpet.

DWIGHT
(gurgling)
Keys are in the car. The keys are
-..in the car...

His words are overtaken by blood.

EXT. CLELAND HOME - NIGHT 252
The Cleland property sits still in the night.

Can’t see Dwight.

EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING 253
A TRANQUIL SUBURBAN SOUNDSCAPE.
KIDS ON BICYCLES pass a BENT CARBON ARROW by a sewer drain.

Another ARROW, EMBEDDED IN AN OAK TREE. Just behind it, an
oblivious NEIGHBOR cleaning his gutters.

along with a few bird droppings.

INT. RANCH HOUSE - MORNING 255
IN THE KITCHEN: the TAPED UP CARDBOARD on the back window.

UNDER THE DINING TABLE: The GARDEN WEEDER lies in a pool of
sunlight.

THE SOUND OF SOMEONE APPROACHING FROM OUTSIDE.

ON THE FRONT DOOR: The Mail slot swings open, fluttering
daylight as a STACK OF MAIL shoves through.

ON THE FLOOR: SAM’S HOUSE KEYS, 4 days worth of JUNK MAIL,
and a POSTCARD, with a drawing of Thomas Jefferson’s home and
outlined block letters filled-in with images of lighthouses,
waterfalls, blue mountains and trees.
