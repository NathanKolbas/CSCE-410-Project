American Bullshit
By

Eric Warren Singer

9/2/10
The following is a true story based on a whole lot of
bullshit...
EXT. STREET - OUTSKIRTS OF ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT

HIGH ANGLE OVER a dark street lined with industrial buildings
and warehouses. Behind the street, The Jersey Turnpike --- we
can see billboards advertising Atlantic City.

A SILVER CADILLAC DEVILLE appears, rolls down the street, turns
into the lot of the "Allied Amusements" warehouse and HONKS.

SUPER: "December 29, 1979 - Atlantic City"
INT. CADILLAC DEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

MEL WEINBERG in the back seat stuffed in between TWO LARGE
GINZO BONEBREAKERS. Immaculately dressed in a Pierre Cardin

suit and overcoat, Mel's wear ing a pair of gold Cazal eyeglasses
with just enough tint to hide the fear in his eyes.

SONNY BLITZ, a nattily dressed wiseguy, is behind the wheel.
Riding shotgun is the Capo of this crew, DOMINICK CASALE, a
stalwart man with the jovial facade of a grandfather.

We see FIVE MOB GOONS emerge from the warehouse and approach.
Blitz gets out, confers with the lead soldier and nods to the
Bonebreaker on Mel's left who then opens the door and exits.

Looking to Dom, Mel makes a silent appeal to him with his eyes
but is ignored --- so he gets out.

EXT. PARKING LOT - ALLIED AMUSEMENTS - CONTINUOUS

Blitz flashes Mel a vicious grin as the Goons take custody of
him and escort him towards the warehouse.

INT. ALLIED AMUSEMENTS - SECONDS LATER

MOVING with Mel as the Goons manhandle him through the dark
warehouse filled with slot machines and arcade games --- down a
flight of stairs --- through a door and into...

INT. RUMPUS ROOM - ALLIED AMUSEMENTS - CONTINUOUS

A formica wood-paneled rumpus room. Mel is ushered over to a
card table seated at which is a little switchblade of a man,
NICKY SCARFO. He’s reading the Wall Street Journal and marking
his stock picks with a mechanical pencil.

On the table: a plate of Italian cheese, a bottle of Barolo
glasses and the Milton Bradley Game of Operation ready to play.

SCARFO
You know who I am?

Mel nods. Gesturing him to take a seat, Scarfo pours a glass of
wine and slides it towards him. Mel declines.

SCARFO (CONT'D)
Well then try some of this Belicino ---

MEL
How about you just tell me what I’m
doing here, Scarfo?
SCARFO
Come on Mel, I insist. Try the goat
cheese. It’S world famous.
(slides plate towards Mel)
Comes from my family’s farm in Sicily’s
Belice Valley...

Feigning disgust, Mel slides the plate back.

SCARFO (CONT'D)
What’s the problem?

MEL
I know a guy, a fuckin’ cheesemonger ---
he told me all about the goat cheese
from that part of Sicily. He says he
won’t touch it. Says it’s tainted...

SCARFO
Fuck do you mean it’s tainted?

MEL
Tainted with that, uh, that animal

disease, you know --- Anthrax...
SCARFO

What !?
MEL

Yeah. The cheesemonger says they got
serious anthrax problems in that area
of Sicily, like an epidemic, cause

all the Tarmers there --- after they
assfuck their i 90ats they all assfuc
each other. s like a vicious circle.

Scarfo flashes a lethal grin and eats a piece of cheese.

SCARFO
You like to play games Mel?

From the darkened, far corner of the room a lighter is ignited
and a cigarette lit --- in the brief illumination Mel catches a
glimpse of the dim outline of a SHADOW MAN seated in a chair

SCARFO (CONT'D)

Friend of mine down in Florida -- you
know the guy you’re into some business
with -- he calls me the other day,
says that you like to play games.

This revelation hits Mel like a fucking sledgehammer --- and
the fear that was contained begins to seep out.

MEL
Bullshit --- why would the guy in
Florida say that you?

SCARFO
Cause he knows that I’m an avid
gamesman myself and he thought that
I'd enjoy playing with you. Monopoly,
Clue, Parcheesi, (MORE) S| and fucking
SCARFO (CONT'D)
Ladders --- I love ‘em all --- but
the game I love the most is this one
right here, Operation. (Beat) So
whaddya say Mel, wanna play?

MEL
I don’t think so...

SCARFO
Mel, what do I do for a living?

MEL
--- You paint houses.

SCARFO
That’s right ---
(slides him ‘Doctor’ cards)
Now pick a fuckin’ card.

Mel hesitantly picks the card: ‘WISHBONE, $300.’

SCARFO (CONT'D)
Tough break. Wishbone’s a bitch.

On edge, Mel takes the tweezers connected to the wire and plucks
the Wishbone out without touching the metal.

SCARFO (CONT'D)
Bravo ---

Scarfo picks his own card, ‘CHARLIE HORSE’ and then masterfully
plucks the piece from the gameboard. He gestures to Mel who
picks another card: ‘WRITER’S CRAMP, $200’ with an illustration
of a pencil in someone’s arm.

SCARFO (CONT'D)
Lucky prick, that’s a fuckin’ gimme.

Struggling for the pencil, Mel’s finger twitches, he hits the
metal -- the patient’s nose FLASHES RED as the BUZZER SOUNDS.

And like a COBRA STRIKING --- Scarfo PINS Mel’s left arm to the
table and PILEDRIVES his metal pencil through Mel’s WRIST like
an icepick. Mel screams in agony as blood SPURTS from the wound.
Scarfo’s Goons hold Mel down, keeping his arm pinned.

MEL
WHADDYA DOING?!
SCARFO
Whaddya mean? We’re playing the game.
MEL
You don’t need to tune me up. Whatever
you want --- we can talk ---
SCARFO

My friend in Florida, he’s through
talking Mel. He never got the Arab’s
money ---
MEL
(screaming at SHADOW MAN)
There was nothing I could do ----

SCARFO
Who you talking to, Mel? There's nobody
there. It's just you and me.

Mel SCREAMS as Scarfo GRINDS the pencil into the wound.

MEL

Whaddya want?!
SCARFO

Whaddya think I want? The truth.
MEL

The truth? (Beat) The truth...
CLOSE ON MEL’S FACE AS SCARFO PUNCHES HIM IN THE SKULL

MEL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
(calm, meditative
The truth is bullshit.

MATCH CUT TO:
CLOSE ON THE TERRORIZED FACE OF MEL'S FATHER, NATHAN WEINBERG:

Nathan screaming a millisecond before a thick pane of clear
glass is savagely smashed and broken over his face ---

MEL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I learned this lesson at a very early
age from the most honest man I ever
knew, my father Nathan...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
INT. GLASS INSTALLATION SHOP - BRONX - DAY
SUPER: "1954 - Bronx, New York"

A warehouse filled with panes of glass glazier’s tools, etc.
Nathan is splayed out on the floor; help ess to stop LUCKY
BARRETTI from stomping his ass out.

MEL (V.0.)
Nate had a successful glass business
in the Bronx --- that is until Lucky
Barretti decided to start a local
glaziers union --- and then everything
just went to shit...

BARRETTI
Smatter with you Weinberg?
(stomps him in the balls)
Why won’t you just fall in line like
everyone else!?

CAMERA CONTINUES PULL BACK through warehouse as Barretti’s crew
of FIVE UNION GOONS destroy everything in sight.
MEL (V.0.)
My father wouldn't get in line cause
even though joining the union would’ve
insured his business, Barretti_was
gonna take a piece of every dollar he
clocked --- making it so that the
only way he could earn for himself
would be to cheat his customers ---
which is something Nathan Weinberg
would never do...

THE CAMERA FINALLY PULLS BACK INTO:
INT. TRUCK - GLASS INSTALLATION SHOP - CONTINUOUS
An ELEVEN YEAR OLD MELVIN WEINBERG hides behind the steering

wheel and cries -- watching the violence in helpless terror
MEL (V.0.)
And so they tuned his ass up ---
wrecked his shop --- tried to knock

him outta of the box...
INT. WEINBERG APARTMENT - KITCHEN - BRONX - NIGHT

Mel is seated at the kitchen table, a birthday cake in front of
him, his face cast aglow by the twelve candles. He’s flanked by
his SISTER and MOTHER, everyone singing “Happy Birthday”.

Mel blows out the candles and with excited anticipation looks
across the table with at his battered and bandaged father.

NATHAN
Mel, I know I promised you a bike for
your birthday but business is ---
(starts to choke up)
I’m sorry Mel ---

The heartbroken expression on Mel’s face is too much for his
father who breaks down and starts to cry.

MEL (V.0.)

It was a terrifying thing for me to
see my father like that. But more
than fear, there was the anger. I
mean just look at this poor schmuck.
Here he is on verge of losing his
livelihood, security for his family,
the respect of his son ---

INT. WEINBERG APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
It’s late, all the lights are out and everyone is asleep.

MEL (V.0.)
...And for what?

We see Mel slink out of the shadows and sneak out the front
door, fully dressed to brave the cold winter night.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - BRONX - MINUTES LATER

A winter-swept street lined with row houses... We see Mel
approach the rear cab of his father’s work-truck.
MEL (V.0.)
What’s the point of having integrity?

CLOSE ON TRUCK: Mel unlocks a storage chest, takes two boxes of
bolts and stuffs them into a shoulder-slung bag.

MEL V.0. (CONT’D)
Integrity ain’t gonna get you what
you want outta this world.

EXT. CLASSIC NEW YORK CITY STOREFRONT WINDOW - BRONX - LATER
CLOSE ON an old school store front window: MANNY’S MEATS.

MEL (V.0.)
Why pledge allegiance to the truth?

Mel’s reflection suddenly appears in the glass. Only a few feet
away from the window we can see that Mel has a slingshot in his
hand. He loads it with a bolt, takes aim and fires --- the huge
glass window SHATTERS with a terrible violence...

MEL V.0. (CONT’D)
The truth can’t save you...

EXT. WEBB AVE. - BRONX - SECONDS LATER

HIGH ANGLE OVER Webb Avenue as Mel rolls down the street; using
his slingshot and bolts to break every window in sight.

MEL (V.0.)
That night, I musta broke every window
in my neighborhood. I broke so many
fuckin' windows they had to import
glass in from Jersey to replace them
all... And I kept on breaking glass
until business got better --- and I
got my bike... Fuck the square life.
Fuck integrity. Fuck the truth. (beat)
The truth is bullshit.

CUT TO BLACK:

Over the blackness we HEAR the shrill DESCENDING WHISTLES AND
EXPLOSIONS of 4th of July fireworks going off...

ROLE TITLE: Big, bullshit letters... “AMERICAN BULLSHIT”
INT. JFK AIRPORT - EASTERN AIRLINES CONCOURSE - MORNING

FOLLOWING CLOSELY BEHIND THE BALL-CRUSHINGLY RAPTUROUS FIGURE
OF A WOMAN tightly wrapped in a chic Chanel skirt-suit ---
striding down the middle of the bustling flight concourse.

SUPERIMPOSE OVER ASS: “September, 1978 --- New York City”

REVERSE ANGLE: In her late twenties, MAXINE GARDNER is a ravenous
beauty whose scorching blue eyes give her a visceral, blow-torch
appeal. Ann Margaret meets Dorothy Parker.

Max approaches the gate of an arriving flight as PASSENGERS
flow into the terminal. HAROLD PIEDMONT, a craggy blue-blood
steps off the jetway, sees the orchid broach pinned to Max’s
lapel and greets her with an unctuous grin.
PIEDMONT
Ms. Gardner --- ?

MAX
(finishing school accent)
Please Harold, it's Max... So good to
finally meet you in person ---
(taking him by the arm)
Now come along, the car is waiting..

EXT./INT. LIMO - A LITTLE LATER

Stretch limo making its way into the city. Piedmont and Max are
seated directly across from each other.

PIEDMONT
I must confess, I’m not comfortable
dealing with loan brokers like
yourself. I’ve heard stories, unseemly
stories about the kind of capital you
people represent ---

MAX
Please, Harold, there’s really no
need to be so vituperative e shop
we’re meeting with only deals with
the most reputable lenders ---

Piedmont looks out the window as they cin a gas station and
sees a long line of cars waiting to fill Someone has
spray-painted the words: “FUCK OPEC” over the station’s sign.

PIEDMONT

That god damn peanut farmer in the
White House is running this economy
into the void! Stagflation, inflation ---
credit markets are all locked up ---

(eyes return to Max)
I mean when institutional bankers
like Chase Manhattan won't lend to a
Piedmont, you know this country's in
serious trouble.

MAX
(clever grin)
And yet despite all of this I’m still
confident that your luck is about to
change.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - MID TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT MORNING
Max and Piedmont enter a stunning, Fifth Ave. skyscraper.
INT. 10TH FLOOR - SKYSCRAPER - MINUTES LATER

Max and Piedmont approach a door: “LONDON INVESTORS - New York
London, Zurich”. We MOVE with them as they enter...

INT. LONDON INVESTORS - SKYSCRAPER - CONTINUOUS

 

 

. The sumptuously appointed reception area of a very smart
looking establishment that exudes an air of success and
reputability. Max can see that Piedmont is impressed.
INT. MEL’S OFFICE - LONDON INVESTORS - SECONDS LATER

The RECEPTIONIST ushers Piedmont and Max into a handsomely
decorated office whose walls are gilded with fine art, pictures
of Mel Weinberg with prominent luminaries and awards from various
civic and business organizations.

Clad in a beautiful bankers suit, Mel greets Piedmont with an
earnest smile and handshake.

MEL
Mel Weinberg...

Mel then gives Max a cordial peck on the cheek.
MEL (CONT'D)

Hi ya Max... How are things?
MAX
Lovely --- and you?
MEL
Capital.
Mel directs Max and Piedmont to sit --- and as she moves to the

couch Mel tilts his head slightly to the right and admires the
swing of Max's ass. He then sits across from Piedmont.

MEL (CONT'D)
Not to be rude but I’ve got a back to
back day as I’m sure you do as well ---
so if we could just cap to the climax ---

MAX
Well have you looked at the setup?

MEL

Yeah, fantastic deal. Top shelf
property. Perfect location for a
shopping center ---.

{takes out cigarette)
Now, I don’t know what Max has_told
you about London Investors so let me
just give you the quick of it ---

(lights up, takes a drag)
I work very closely with a consortium
of off shore banks that are expanding
their loan portfolios. On their end I
help them find worthy deals that the
mainline lenders have missed. On your
end I help you put a_ loan package
together and hand-hold the deal through
the process --- using all my weight
to get the loan approved ---

PIEDMONT
Can you guarantee an approval?

MEL
Of course not. That being said you
should know I never take on deals I
can’t close.
PIEDMONT
How much is all this going to cost
me?

MEL

Six points on the backend, after you
get yours. Only thing I ask is that
you cover my costs with processing
your package, which in your case will
e about twenty-five thousand ---

PIEDMONT
If you don’t get me the financing do
I get the twenty-five thousand back?

Mel flashes Max a “the fuck’s wrong with this guy?” look.

MEL
No. The twenty five is non-refundable,
just like my time...

With an anxious sigh Piedmont gives Mel a desperate glare.

PIEDMONT
I just need to know that you can get
me the money ---

MEL
Look, I’m not Willy Loman. I’m not
here to sell you --- that being said---

(leans forward earnestly)
You should know that I believe in
cash and happy endings. I mean when a
businessman needs money, he needs
Money --- not an aspirin and a fuckin'

prayer. That’s how I make my living ---
(gets up from chair)

Anyway, think it over. I hope we can
do some business together. If not
best of luck down the block.

Piedmont and Max stand, Mel ushers them towards the door. Mel
gives Max a peck on the cheek and then shakes Piedmont's hand.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - MID TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT DAY

We see Mel behind the wheel of a forest green, Lincoln Mark-V
as it exits the garage and heads down the street.

EXT. STREETS - MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS

VARIOUS ANGLES of Mel driving --- sultry late afternoon. We
see him pull up to the valet of the PIERRE HOTEL and exit...

INT. SUITE - PIERRE HOTEL - MINUTE LATER

Mel enters the elegant residential suite. Late afternoon sunlight
is flooding in through the huge window which overlooks the par
There is a Shirley Temple waiting for him on the bar. He grabs —
it, sits on the couch and sips as he gazes out.

The room darkens as the sun sets behind the skyline of buildings
across the park --- and Mel suddenly sees the reflection of a
10.

woman in the window’s glass. The woman is standing in the doorway
of the bathroom behind him.

MEL
What’s up, pussycat. Is he hooked?

MAX
Heavy as lead.

Walking towards Mel, the woman reveals herself to be Max. She
hands Mel a check from ‘Harold Piedmont’ made out to London
Investors for ‘$25,000.’ --- And gives him a sensual kiss.

Pulling up an armchair, Max positions it directly in front of
Mel and sits down provocatively, her skirt hiked up to her
anties. Kicking off her heels, she perches her feet on Mel’s
nees and lazily spreads her legs wide open.

MAX (CONT'D)
(foxy grin)
I also got him to front me three points
on_ that Bank of Sark CD I’ve been
holding.

MEL
What is it with you Max? Always
wanting. I mean we talked about this.
You never send a guy to the river ---

MAX
Oh please. Don’t show me the moves if
you don’t want me to make them.

MEL
I just want you to make them smartly ---

MAX
Life is short and so is money ---

Max reclines into the chair; totally relaxed, completely
uninhibited. Then beckons Mel with a pleasure seeking grin.

MAX (CONT'D)
So why not go out on a limb? I mean ---
(slides hand over crotch)
...Isn’t that where the fruit is?

Mel moves in but Max shoves him back with her feet.
MAX. (CONT'D)

(off Mel’s look)
You know, it occurred to me earlier

today --- that once I walk into your
office I’m just a spectator...
MEL

Whaddya mean?

OVER THE SHOULDER of Max; Keeping Mel pinned back with one leg,
she slides her underwear off the other
11.

MAX
I always have to just sit there with
my mouth shut and watch you get
yourself off as you close the deal.
(begins playing with herself)
Well, now it’s your turn to watch me --

Max’s legs contort, feet bend and flex. Her body slowly twists
and turns like a corkscrew as she gets herself off.

Mel’s grin swells into a stupefied, life affirming smile.
EXT./INT. STELLA'S SUPPER CLUB - FIFTY SEVENTH STREET - LATER

A fully packed and incredibly noisy but chic restaurant filled
with a mixture of wiseguys, hustlers and celebs. Like the Copa
but without the shows. Clearly the place to be seen.

ANGLE CLOSE on two hustlers standing at the end of the bar; SY
LENTZ (very gay) and RONNY DAMONE.

RONNY
Get out. Guy was chief of staff to
Nixon. Fuckin NATO Supreme Commander.

SY
And men of his stature can’t be
faggots? Cause I’m telling you, they
can, they are and thank God for it.

Mel carrying an attaché, approaches and greets them with a nod.

MEL
Fellas... what’s up?

RONNY
Sy says that Al Haig’s a shitstabber.

SY
Oh, Haig doesn’t engage in sodomy.
No, he's strictly into helmeting ---

MEL
The fuck is helmeting?

SY
He gets off from having bald men try
to stick their heads up his ass.

Mel laughs --- Ronny is horrified.

RONNY
That's the worst thing I ever heard ---

MEL
(rubs Ronny's head)
Don't knock it till you try it, Ron.
(to Sy
You got anything tasty for me?

SY
Setups on the packages we’re bringing
in through Artie Kessler in Pittsburgh ---
12.

Sy hands Mel some files which he puts into his attache.

MEL
Just keep feeding me the action fellas ---
and spread the word, cause I’m hungry.

SONNY BLITZ suddenly rolls up next to Mel.

SONNY
Well, if it ain’t the golden Hebe
MEL
So Sonny ---_I guess that makes you
the nickel plated ginzo?
SONNY
Don't get smart with me jagoff ---
MEL

Zip your fly, Sonny ---
Sonny looks like he’s about to stab Mel but is stopped by the

sight of his boss, DOMINICK CASALE. Blitz quickly backs down.
DOM
Hey, there he is --- how are ya Mel ---

Taking Mel by the arm, Dom ushers him towards the back door

MEL
What is it with your fucking crew ---
always breaking my balls ---

DOM
Whaddya expect? You’re a compulsive
earner -- Ya make 'em look bad.

EXT. PARKING LOT - ALLEY - BACK OF STELLA'S - MINUTE LATER

 

Dom and Mel lean up against Dom's Cadillac.

DOM
Anything you need me to take care of?
Problems, beefs, whatever ---

MEL
Nothing ---

Mel takes a cash stuffed envelope out of his attaché, hands it
to Dom.

MEL (CONT'D)
July.

DOM
(smiles, impressed)
Heavy.

MEL
These things come in streaks. And
it’s been seven come eleven for me
lately.
13.

DOM

Luck is the residue of design, Mel.

(lights a cigarette)
While everyone else is out there
scrambling for the big score --- you ---
you Figured out that the real money's
in small scores at a high volume. You
took the front end scam off the street
opened up a front office where your
marks are delivered to you by your
own network of feeders --- you're
like the McDonald's of con merchants.
A real innovator ---

MEL
Thanks Dom ---

DOM
I just don't get how you keep it all
going. Thirty-forty marks a week
none of them is getting their loan
and no one’s making a beef?

MEL
Almost all of these assholes applying
for a loan cook the numbers on their
financial statements --- gives me the
perfect blow off: “Hey douchebag, you
didn’t get the loan cause your
financials are bullshit".

DOM
But what if they're legit?

MEL
Keep the fees low and for most people
it ain't worth the time or headache
to go to court or the cops ---
(smiles at Dom
But on_ the rare occasion that I have
a problem, I always got you ---

EXT. MEL’S HOUSE - LONG ISLAND, NY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Driving down an upper-middle class street of ranch houses, Mel
pulls into his driveway, parks next to a station wagon. We can
see the name WEINBERG on the mailbox.

INT. MEL’S HOUSE - LONG ISLAND, NY - MINUTES LATER

The house is in the midst of a REMODEL. Walking into his home,
Mel navigates his way through a maze of construction materials
and into the living room where he finds his wife, ESTELLE
WEINBERG, asleep on the couch in front of the TV. Clad ina
lightweight nightgown, Estelle is a petite and attractive woman
in her late thirties.

Mel turns the TV off and scoops her up in his arms and WE MOVE
with them as he carries her to the bedroom.

ESTELLE
(sleepy, eyes closed)
Long day at the office ---?
14.

MEL
Braindead. Been locked in a room
crunching numbers with my accountants
since this afternoon.

ESTELLE
Sorry.

Hey, nobody ever” Said a life in finance
was gonna be exciting.

ESTELLE
(tired smile
But it beats installing glass...

MEL
(affectionately)
Yeah...

INT. BEDROOM - MEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

He gently lays her down on the bed...

ESTELLE
Dinner's in the fridge and please
look over the bid for the pool ---

MEL
Go back to sleep, we’ll talk in the
morning.

INT. KITCHEN - MEL’S HOUSE - MINUTE LATER

Mel opens the fridge, sees the sandwich and a child-scrawled
note: “YANKEES 8 - OREOS 5. YOU OWE ME FIVE BUCKS, WILLIE”.

Smiling at the note, Mel grabs the sandwich and is about to sit
when_the backdoor suddenly opens --- and in shuffles little
WILLIE WEINBERG, age 12 il

Mel lights vp like a pinball machine when he sees his son ---
his eyes filled with pure adoration and joy.

MEL
Hey boychick --

WILLIE

ie’s wearing nothing but boxers.

(groggy
I’m sleeping in the hammock. Too hot
to be inside. Mom says it's okay.

MEL
Okay.

WILLIE
I gotta pee.

Willie sleepily marches over to the bathroom off the kitchen.
Mel watches him lift up the seat and pull down his boxers.

MEL
How was camp today?
15.

WILLIE
Don’t talk to me. You know I can’t go
if you talk to me.

Mel shuts his mouth and smiles inwardly. Willie finally pees
flushes, washes his hands --- and shuffles out.

WILLIE (CONT'D)
You get my note?

MEL
Yeah. I got your note. What happened?

WILLIE
Top of the eighth, Reggie Jackson
took it downtown off a high and hard
one.

Willie holds out his hand with a grin which Mel returns as he
hands him the cash.

MEL
Willie-boy, if you were purple then
purple would be my favorite color.

WILLIE
Likewise, Pop.

EXT. FIFTH AVE. - MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY

REVERSE TRACK ON JIMMY BOYLE as he strides up Fifth Ave. clad

in a suit and tie, carrying a briefcase. In his early thirties
Boyle has hard boiled good looks of a book-smart boxer and exudes
the edgy, alluring intensity of a man on the make.

An ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in front of him suddenly gets her high heel
caught in a ventilation grill. Boyle smoothly swoops in to help
her, effortlessly pulls the heel out and then flashes the woman
a self-assured smile --- before moving on and entering the
skyscraper Mel’s office is in.

INT. LONDON INVESTORS - SKYSCRAPER - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Boyle is waiting in the reception area. The Cute Receptionist
gets up from her desk and nods to Boyle.

BOYLE
Do you mind if I use your phone for a
second?
The Receptionist turns her phone around --- Boyle dials and

then flashes the Receptionist a flirtatious smile which she
can't help but return.

BOYLE (PHONE) (CONT’D)
It’s me. Let her call in five.

Hanging up, Boyle FOLLOWS the Receptionist though a door and
into Mel’s office and closes the door behind him...

INT. MEL’S OFFICE - LONDON INVESTORS - SKYSCRAPER
Mel gives Boyle a hearty handshake.
16.

BOYLE
James Boyle ---

MEL
(gesturing Boyle to sit)
Mel Weinberg...

Boyle takes a seat and Mel sits across from him.

MEL. (CONT'D)
So who are you coming to me through?

BOYLE
Maxine Gardner ---

Boyle hands Mel Max's business card and surveys the office.

MEL
Funny, Max never mentioned your name ---

BOYLE
I didn't see the point in giving her
a fee for just walking me in ---

MEL
The point is that I know her and I
don't know you.

BOYLE
I'm strapped for cash, Mel ---
Mel eyes Boyle with a subtle wariness, sizing him up.

MEL
Well as Max might of mentioned I have
a strong relationship with a consortium
of offshore banks that are expanding
their loan portfolios ---

BOYLE
(interrupting)
How do I know your banks are real?

MEL
Real? These are all legally chartered
reputable, second tier lenders.

BOYLE
Just because they’re chartered doesn’t
mean they have money. For all I know
your bank is just some guy in the
Bahamas with nothing more than a phone,
Telex, and a box of stationary.

Mel leans back and tenses up --- upset by Boyle's comment.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
I don’t mean to be rude. It’s just
that I know people who’ve been burned
by scam artists posing as money brokers ---
guys who take front end fees by
promising loans from banks that don’t
exist...
17.

MEL

If you have questions about my lenders
I can get you financials, counter
party references, whatever --- and if

ave concerns about me --- take a
ook around, does it look like I’m
some five and dime hustler dealing
out of my hat?

BOYLE

(looks around)
No, I’ vd ot to hand it to yoy" Mel.
This really is an unbelievabl
convincing setup. It’s the detail
work, the little things --

(gesturing)
Like the picture of you with Spiro
Agnew. That’s what pulls it al
together. Makes everything feel so
legit --- and safe

(locking eyes with Mel)
You’ve got a real gift.

Mel sits back. An uneasy silence as they stare each other down.

MEL
Who you with?

The phone on the table next to Mel suddenly RINGS. Mel doesn’t
pick it up, just sits there glaring at Boyle

BOYLE
You’re going to want to take that
call.

MEL (INTO PHONE
(finally picks up phone

Yeah, okay put her through... What’s

up, Max? --- When?
(gives Boyle a glare

No, don’t say anything. I’1l take

care of it. Where have they got you? ---

Alright, just sit tight...

Mel hangs up the phone, lights a cigarette, takes a drag.

BOYLE

Special Agent Jimmy Boyle --- FBI ---
MEL

So what’s on your warrant for me?
BOYLE

Bank fraud, wire fraud, securities
fraud, criminal conspiracy. (Beat)
But whether or not I execute it, that
all depends.

MEL
Yeah okay, whatever, kid --- you mind
if I call my lawyer now?
18.

BOYLE
Sure, but how about you let me buy
you a drink first? |

(off Mel’s silence)

C’mon Mel. You lawyer up then I have
to arrest you. Why not at least hear
me out? I know a place right around
the corner.

EXT. STREET - MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - A LITTLE LATER

MOVING with Mel and Boyle as they stroll down Fifth Avenue.
Boyle takes off his tie and unbuttons his shirt.

BOYLE

This goddamn heat is oppressive ---
MEL

So then why the fuck are we out here?
BOYLE

Cause I wanted you to feel it.
MEL

(annoyed)

Jesus... Whaddya wanna talk to me
about, Boyle?

BOYLE
Love.

MEL
Love?

BOYLE

Yeah, right, love. (Beat) You see the
bitch of it for me is that you do it
all so smart. I mean trying to build
up enough evidence to make a case on
you, it’s like trying to pick up
Mercury with a fork. But then I

realized ._---

{uittze smile at Mel)
Who needs evidence when you’ve got
love?

MEL
What is this? Do you wanna to fuck me
or arrest me?

BOYLE
I've been watching you for the past
few months --- Your wife Estelle,
your son Willie --- I know that your
amily has no idea who and what you
really are. They think you’re a
completely legit guy --- A loyal
husband --- Adoring father --- Pillar
of the community, right?

They hit 42nd Street and Boyle steers Mel to the right, towards
Bryant Park.
19.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
I don’t know how you do it, Mel. I
mean the energy it must take to sustain
the lie. Day %, day out. (beat) And
it tells me things --- like how much
you want to protect them --- how much
ou care about what they think ---
ow much you love them ---

They roll up to a hot dog stand on the outskirts of the park.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
You want anything?

MEL
Lemme have a Tab.

BOYLE
(to vendor)
Gimme a Tab and a Yoohoo.

The hot dog vendor pulls out the drinks out from the cooler,
gives them to Boyle, who pays and then hands Mel his soda. Moving
to a bench in the park, Boyle and Mel sit.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
And then there’s Maxine Gardner.
(taking a swig of Yoohoo)
When I watch you two together you
know what I see? I see a man that's
head over heels. And who could blame
you? She’s a phenomenal woman.

Reaching into his pocket, Boyle pulls out and hands Mel a Justice
Department indictment summary that, point by point, lays out
their case against Max.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
Unfortunately she’s greedy --- and
not as careful as you are.

As he reviews the document, we can see Mel’s cool facade begin
to melt into one of restrained anxiety.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
Now you might be able to beat your
rap down to a banker’s bit, maybe
even probation -- but as you can see
our case against Max is a lock.

(takes summary, from Mel)

She’s going away and I mean for
at least a nickel --- and there’s no
fix Dominic Casale can put in that's
gonna make this go away.

MEL
(after long hard beat)
Whaddya want?

BOYLE
Five high-line white collar busts ---

Mel gives Boyle a nod and watches him leave.

EXT. MET CORRECTIONAL CENTER - DOWNTOWN - WAITING AREA - LATER
Mel sits impatiently on a bench in the bustlin
the city's federal remand center. He has a pin
Moishe's 2nd Ave. bake shop on his lap.

We HEAR the electric buzz of the door being unlocked ---

Max is escorted out by a FAT BAIL BONDSMAN. She looks like hell.

waiting room of
BAKERY BOX from
21.

Mel and Max lock eyes --- both relieved to see each other. Mel
approaches and can see that she's shaken up. Max sees the bakery
box in Mel's hand and her face brightens up slightly.

MAX
Chocolate rugelach from Moishe's?

MEL
Your favorite.

Deeply touched by the gesture, Max throws her arms around Mel
and gives him a soulful and tender hug.

MEL (CONT'D)
You okay?

MAX
I am now.

EXT. MEL'S LINCOLN - A LITTLE LATER

We are gazing through the Lincoln's windshield at Mel and Max.
Mel's driving and Max is riding shotgun, eating the rugelach.

MAX
You should reach out to Dom ---

MEL
I can't. I get this anywhere near Dom
and suddenly this thing has predicates ---
FEDS will try to fold it into a RICO
statute ---

 

MAX
Then call Bernie Meyerson, you always
said he's the best defense in town ---

MEL
Whaddya think Bernie's gonna do except
take his fee? He can't fix this ---

MAX
How do we know until we talk to him?

MEL
Cause that snot-nosed little feeb
showed me their summary against you --
it's open and shut. Tapes of you
closing over the phone. Signed letters
of commitment that you sent through
the mail. Your prints on The Sark

paper. I mean I couldn't believe it ---
(disappointed look at Max)

And the worst part about it is that
you knew better. I taught you better...

MAX
What do you want me to say? You're
right? I'm sorry? We all know better
despite doing worse.

MEL
Don't get all fucking abstract on me.
I'm talking here and now ---
22.

MAX
So am I. This is my calamity, I'll
deal with the consequences ---

MEL
Can you deal with doing five years in
shit city?! (Beat) One week inside
you'll be ready to talk ---

An enraged Max PUNCHES Mel in the mouth hard enough to draw
blood. Mel slams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt.

MEL (CONT'D)
The fuck is wrong with you?!

Max gets out of the car and starts marching up Broadway barefoot.
As she walks away Mel dabs his lip, looks at the blood on his
fingers and then gazes out at Max --- tilting his head slightly
to the right to admire the swing of her ass.

He pulls the car over, gets out. We see him catch up to her

EXT. WEST BROADWAY - TRIBECA - CONTINUOUS
Mel tries to grab her but she swats his hand away.

MEL
I didn't mean how that sounded ---

MAX
Yes you did. You're so fucking scared
that I'd rat you out you'd become a
rat yourself just to stop me ---

MEL
That's how it works with the Feds
They come after the things you care
about the most and turn ‘em on you ---

MAX
Which is why you can't take this deal
Mel. You can't trust them.

MEL

So what am I supposed to do Max? Just
let these fucks put you away? Let
them out me to my family?

MAX

Taking this deal won't stop that --

it just postpones the inevitable.

Once you make your cases for them
it's all gonna come out at the trials!

MEL

No, not everything. Not you and me.

And this will buy me some space between
now and then.

MAX

The only thing this is gonna buy you
is more trouble.

(MORE )

 
23.

MAX (CONT'D)
locking eyes with Mel
Tell Estelle the truth, tell the Feebs
to fuck off --- let's go to court and
fight this thing together.

Mel's silent, overwhelmed by the terrible choice he's gotta
make...

MEL
I don't know...

EXT. MEL’S HOUSE - LONG ISLAND, NY - LATER THAT MORNING

 

Mel pulls in his driveway, parks and gets out of the car sporting
a fat lip --- looking totally strung out.

INT. MEL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

 

Estelle is in the kitchen’s laundry alcove loading the washer.
Willie’s at the table, eating cereal and watching cartoons.

Mel moves to the kitchen cabinet, grabs a bottle of J&B and a
glass --- and then sits.

WILLIE
Hey Pop.

MEL
Hey ---

ESTELLE

What’re you doing home? I thought you
were staying in the city ---

No response. Estelle comes out, sees the sorry state of Mel and
the booze. Tensing up with concern, she turns the tv off. Mel
shoots the glass of whiskey, then Looks up at Estelle.

ESTELLE (CONT'D)
What is it? What's wrong?

The weight in his eyes makes it clear that Mel's on the verge
of confessing everything to her --- but then he pulls back...

MEL
I’m shutting down London Investors.

ESTELLE
What?! Why!?

MEL
Financing I_was counting on pulled
out at the last minute and some very
big deals fell through. The only way
I can avoid a Chapter 11 is to fold
the company up.

ESTELLE
Jesus, Mel --- I mean --- four years
you spend building a business and
it’s over in one day?

Mel says nothing and has another drink.
24.

ESTELLE (CONT'D)
What about the vacation to the Bahamas?
What about the remodel?

MEL
We're gonna have to tighten our belts.
Put everything on hold for a little

while ---

ESTELLE
On hold?! Mel, look around --- how
can we live like this?

MEL

I’m sorry, Estelle. I just need a
little time to figure things out.

Beyond upset, Estelle blows out of the kitchen. Not wanting to
look vulnerable in front Willie, Mel puts on a brave face and
gesture's Willie to come over to him. Mel then reassur ingly

puts his hands on his son's shoulders and locks eyes wit im.

; MEL (CONT'D).
Everything’s gonna be all right. I

promise --- okay?
WILLIE
Sure pop ---
MEL

Go get dressed.

Willie exits kitchen. Mel takes Boyle’s business card out and
stares at it for a long beat. He then finishes his drink gets
up, moves to the kitchen’s phone and dials.

MEL (CONT'D)
Okay Boyle ---- let’s fuck.

CUT TO BLACK:
EXT. GRAVEYARD - THE BRONX - DAY

A light drizzle falls over an overcast expanse of tombstones
and trees. In the distance we see Mel’s Lincoln cut along a
road towards the center of the screen and park.

SUPER: “November, 1978”

CLOSE ON THE GRAVESTONE OF NATHAN WEINBERG: Standing solemnly
at the tombstone of his father, Mel notices that his father’s
grave is dirty with grime and leaves -- but the grave next to
it is immaculate. Mel then sees that there’s a small “Perpetual
Care” plaque affixed to the bottom of the clean gravestone.

JUMP CUT TO:

SECONDS LATER - ANGLE CLOSE ON OPENED TRUNK_OF MEL’S CAR: |
Reaching into a tool box, Mel pulls out a flat-head screwdriver
hammer and tube of super glue.

JUMP CUT TO:
25.

MINUTE LATER - ANGLE ON GRAVE NEXT TO MEL’S FATHER: Mel uses
the screwdriver and hammer to chisel off the Perpetual Care
plaque. He then squeezes out the entire tube of super-glue on
the back of the plaque and affixes it to his father’s stone.

MEL
From me to you Pop...

_ MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
(grating New England accent)
Put it back ---

Spinning around, Mel sees a STIFF: clad in a raincoat, suit and
tie; marching towards him. In his late forties, the Stiff has a
face like a foot --- and exudes the tight-ass, awkward energy
of a man who is so painfully ill at ease with himself he makes
everyone around him uncomfortable.

STIFF
I saw what you did. Now put it back.

MEL
Put what back? I don’t know what you’re
talking about.

STIFF
Empty your pockets.

MEL
Fuck you, jaggoff ---

The Stiff suddenly makes an aggressive move to reach for one of

Mel’s pockets --- and Mel SHOVES him back so hard the Stiff
slips on the slick grass and falls on his ass.
BOYLE (0.S.)
(hollering)

What the hell is this?

Both men look and see Boyle getting out his Crown Vic and storm
towards them. The Stiff scrambles to his feet, embarrassed.

Boyle is being followed by two men: SPECIAL AGENT BURT GROSSWALD
and SPECIAL AGENT ALVIN ACKERMAN.

STIFF
I observed the 2-0-9 as he removed a
perpetual care marker from this grave
and put it on that grave and when I
ordered him to put it back he denied
everything and assaulted me.

MEL
Assaulted you? This asshole tried to
stick his hands in my pockets and ---

BOYLE
I don’t want to hear it, Weinberg...
(gets into Mel’s face)
If an FBI agent tells you to do
something, anything --- tells you to
pour gasoline on your cock and balls
ight them on fire so he can warm his
(MORE )
26.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
hands around it --- you do it, or you
are done.

MEL
This hump is with you?

BOYLE
(gesturing to Stiff)
That’s Special Agent Bob Polk.
(to Grosswald)
Special Agent Brut Grosswald...
(to Ackerman
And Special Agent Alvin Ackerman ---

MEL
(chuckling to Ackerman)
Holy 's shit! I don’t believe it! A
fuckin' Jew_in the Bureau!?
(smiles, offering hand)
Hey, nighpokheh --- mazel tov, babe ---

ACKERMAN
I’m not Jewish...

MEL
(chuckles)
Yeah, sure you're not...

BOYLE
These agents along with myself will
be handling you.

MEL
Terrific --- so what now?

BOYLE
Tony Denato.

MEL
Tony the Nutcracker --- ?

BOYLE
(nods)
He's one of the city’s biggest
butterfly dealers --- stolen
counterfeit securities, funny paper ---

MEL
Fuck that. The deal was for me to
help you make cases against con
merchants like me --- not a mobbed up
maniac like Denato.

GROSSWALD
Maniac!? Guy’s a lawyer for chrissake.

MEL
Yeah, he’s a lawyer who worked his
way through law school by doing hits
for the Bino’s. Got his nickname by
puttin’ guy’s balls in a nutcracker
and squeezing them till they popped ---
27.

BOYLE
This is the target Mel --- and you're
going to deliver him ---

MEL
You won’t put me on salary --- how do

you expect me to deliver anything
when I gotta put food on the table?

ACKERMAN
You must've made three million last
year. Where’d it all go?

MEL
My overhead was murder ---

BOYLE
Bullshit.

MEL
I wanna get paid.

BOYLE
Until you produce Denato we’ve got
nothing to talk about. |
(starts back to his car)
Thanksgiving’s in a couple of weeks ---
I want to hear some ideas for an
approach the following Monday.

Mel stands there with a_ “fuck me” expression on his face. As
Ackerman and Grosswald follow Boyle back to the car. After a
beat, Mel sees that Polk is staring at him.

MEL

What the fuck’s with you?
POLK

The marker --- put it back.

Mel just walks off.

EXT. CHELSEA HOTEL - MANHATTAN - LATE THAT AFTERNOON

The venerable old hotel for artists and stoners of the day...
INT. ROOM - CHELSEA HOTEL - A LITTLE LATER

 

The worn, bohemian charm Chelsea is a stark contrast to the
elegance of the Pierre...

Mel's fully dressed and lies on the bed, smoking a cigarette ---
clearly strung out with high anxiety.

In the full-sized mirror affixed to the opened bathroom door we
can see the reflection of Max soaking naked in the tub, smoking
a joint.
MAX
(lamenting)
I miss the Pierre. I miss the days
that I_ could just reach under my bed
and pull out forty thousand dollars
in cash.
28.

MEL
For chrissake, it’s been a_coupla
months and you’re talking like it was
ten years ago.

MAX
Well it feels like it was.
(beat, takes a long drag)
I've got no action, can’t make any

Moves --- running out of cash. I don’t
know what to do with myself...
MEL
(snaps)

Spare me, Max. I got bigger problems
to deal with right now than your
inertia.

In the mirror, we see Max get up out of the tub --- and without
toweling herself off, she slinks out of the bathroom towards
Mel. Her eyes filled with sexy resolve, she straddles him.

MEL (CONT'D)
Hey -- you're all wet!

MAX
(grabbing Mel's dick)
I know ---

MEL
(shoves Max off
What the fuck are you doing?

The pain and humiliation of Mel's rejection cuts across Max's
face --- the intensity of its sting shocks her. Not wanting Mel
to see her vulnerability, she storms into the bathroom ---
slamming the door shut behind her.

Mel shuts his eyes with dread --- gets up and walks over to the
door only to find that it's locked.

MEL (CONT'D)

Come on Max --- Open the door ---
MAX (0.S.)

Fuck off, Mel ---
MEL

I'm sorry, okay? It's just I'm tense ---
MAX (0.S.)

Yeah, I know. Which is why I was trying
to help you, shitbag ---

MEL
If you really wanna help, then help
me figure out this Denato thing.

MAX (0.S.)
Help you help the Feds? I think not.
MEL

Hey, you’ re the one that got me into
this
29.

MAX (0.S.)
I told you not to take the deal. I
knew that they'd screw you ---

MEL
(locking eyes with himself
in the mirror) | .
No matter what happens in life there's
always some asshole who knew it would ---

MAX (0.S.
Whatever, Mel. If you had any balls
or brains you’d stop wasting your
time thinking of ways to help them
and start thinking of ways to help
yourself! Now leave!

Mel grabs his jacket and leaves.
EXT. CHELSEA BAR - A LITTLE LATER

Gazing through the window of a local pub, we see Mel sitting at
the bar next to a COUPLE OF BARFLIES.

MIKE WALLACE (V.O.)
Tonight on 60 minutes, the shadowy
world of Arab oil and the fabulous
wealth it’s creating in the Middle
East ---

INT. CHELSEA BAR - CONTINUOUS

Mel nurses his drink, lost in his thoughts while kind of watching
the TV behind the bar at the same time.

ON THE TV Mike Wallace presents a_60 MINUTES intro to a segment
about the Arab sheiks that control OPEC. IMAGES ARE INTERCUT OF
white-robed Arabs, Rolls Royces, gas fields in Saudi Arabia and
gas lines in the United States, etc...

MIKE WALLACE (ONSCREEN)
--- From their extravagant homes,
their opulent yachts, their incredible
lifestyles... all of it powered by
the world’s most valuable commodit
Petroleum. Are the men that contro
OPEC getting filthy rich at the expense
of the rest of the world? Tonight on
60 Minutes!

The show cuts to a commercial and Mel sits up as if stung by an
inspired notion. His wheels begin to turn...

BARFLY ONE
Fucking Arabs keep getting richer and
I gotta wait forty five minutes just
to fill up my goddamn tank!?

BARFLY TwO
They got all the money in the world,
whadda they need more for?
30.

The exchange between the Barflies triggers something in Mel and
we suddenly see his face light up with an inward smile as his
inspired notion blooms into an ingenious scheme.

MAN’S VOICE (OVER SPEAKERPHONE )
You had such a good thing going with
London. It’s a fuckin’ shame ---

INT. MEL’S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

MOVING ACROSS MEL’S DESK which is covered with a mosaic of
library books, note-filled legal pads, Xerox’d news stories,
magazine articles, etc. --- and all of it about Middle East
oil, OPEC, the men who control it, etc.

MEL (INTO SPEAKERPHONE )
Hey, when God closes one door, he
opens a window ---

The phone on the desk is hooked to a SPEAKER-PHONE.
MAN'S VOICE (OVER SPEAKERPHONE )

What’s up?

MEL
I'm into some new deals with an Arab
sheik ---

MAN'S VOICE (OVER SPEAKERPHONE )
An Arab sheik!?

MEL
Yeah, from the Emirates ---

CAMERA PANS UP to reveal Mel seated at his desk, glancing at a
volume of “THE MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC DIGEST” as he chats.
Unbeknownst to him ESTELLE is standing in the door behind Mel ---
listening to him talk...

MAN'S VOICE (OVER SPEAKERPHONE )
Come on Mel, you being serious?

; _ MEL
Serious as prick cancer ---

MAN'S VOICE (OVER SPEAKERPHONE )
Anything for me?

MEL
You gotta line on any paper? CD’s
securities, b-bonds, notes, whatever ---

MAN'S VOICE (OVER SPEAKERPHONE )
Maybe. Why?

MEL
The Sheik can’t earn interest on the
money he’s got in his country’s banks
cause of the Arab laws against usury ---
and he's scared that the shitstorm
they got in Iran is coming his way.
He wants to get all his cash out now,
before it’s too late.
31.

MAN'S VOICE (OVER SPEAKERPHONE )
But how does funny paper help him do
at?

MEL
If the sheik signs over a million
dollar CD to his bank --- they’1l
allow him to withdraw the cas
equivalent --- ya see, cause as far
as the bank’ s concerned, the sheik’s
money isn’t really leaving their
vaults. Get it?

MAN'S VOICE (OVER_ SPEAKERPHONE )
Yeah, yeah. How much you lookin for?

MEL
As much as you can get your hands on.

MAN'S VOICE (OVER SPEAKERPHONE )
Yeah, okay --- lemme get back at you ---

MEL
You do that Mick, and spread the word
cause I’m hungry.

EXT./INT. MEL’S MARK V_- STEINWAY ST - ASTORIA - DAY

Mel slowly cruising down Steinway Street in the Little Egypt
section of Astoria, Queens. Mel scans both sides of this small
neighborhood thoroughfare lined with Arab shops and restaurants ---
clearly looking for something.

EXT. BASIR’S TOBACCO SHOP - STEINWAY STREET - CONTINUOUS

The TOBACCO SHOP PROPRIETOR, a stately fooking EGYPTIAN in his
sixties, play s backgammon on a card table with ANOTHER EGYPTIAN
MAN. They’re surrounded by their FIVE RESPECTIVE SONS. Everyone
speaking Arabic.

We see Mel’s LINCOLN roll down the street. Mel locks eyes on

the men, quickly sizes them up, pulls over and parks. The chatter
goes quiet as the wary-eyed Egyptians watch Mel get out of his
car and approach.

 

 

MEL
Salam wa aleikum, fellas.
PROPRIETOR
Aleikum ah salam. Can I help you?
MEL
Well, if eyouere interested in making
a few she els, then yeah...

EXT. STELLA’S SUPPER CLUB - NIGHT

A BLACK ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM pulls up in front of Stella’s. A
CHAUFFEUR gets out and opens the door.

Donning his best suit, Mel steps out and stands aside as _ the
Tobacco Shop Proprietor exits the car iy’ fol a beautiful white
thobe and kingly headdress. He is_ quickly followed by his
entourage of three sons who are also clad in Arab garb.
32.

INT. STELLA’S SUPPER CLUB - LITTLE LATER

Mel and the Egyptians are seated at the best table in the house ---
a private corner booth at the far end of the room.

It’s obvious that everyone is checking them out. Mel occasionally
waves or nods to people he knows -- carefully and respectfully
keeping everyone at bay and away from his "Sheik"

CLOSE ON TABLE; The Proprietor’s sons are chatting in Arabic
and having a good time but all in deference to their father who
sits back with a reserved and regal posture.

Son #2 accidentally spills some red sauce on his robe...

MEL
(screaming whisper )
Hey, shmuck, careful will ya. Costume
shop’s gonna jam me on the dry cleaning ---

Mel is abruptly interrupted by the sight of BOYLE walking into
Stella's. He approaches the booth and sits down next to Mel,
leans in close. The two men talk in hushed but angry tones.

MEL (CONT'D)
The fuck you doing here?!!!

BOYLE
Let me ask you a question Mel --- do
I look like some bog-trotting, shanty
asswipe from Hackensack?

MEL
What?

Boyle suddenly and stealthily gives Mel a quick but savage sucker
punch in the groin. Mel does his best to maintain his composure
ut is obviously in pain ---

Tobacco Shop Proprietor is alarmed and confused...

BOYLE
Answer the question Mel. Do I look
like some bog-trotting, shanty asswipe
from Hackensack?

MEL
What the hell are you talking about!?

Boyle gives Mel another even_harder tightening fast dick-punch.
He keels forward and Boyle, like a concerned friend, pats him
on the back as if he's having digestion trouble.

BOYLE

I’m talking about it hasn’t even been
two weeks since we started up and
you’re already back into business for
yourself !?

(off look on Mel’s face)
Yeah, I know about you and the Arab.
Everyone knows. It’s all over the
street!

The freaked out Tobacco Shop Proprietor starts to get up to
leave but Mel forces him to sit back down.
33.

MEL
The fuck you going?
PROPRIETOR
I do not want a problem ---
MEL
Then sit your ass down and keep your
mouth shut ---
BOYLE
What the hell are you into here?
MEL

How do you think this works Boyle?
You think I just call up a wiseguy
like Denato and say let’s make a deal?
No. You gotta put out the honey-pot
and let the flies come to you ---
(smiling nod to Proprietor)

..And what better honey-pot is there
than an oil-rich Sheik? You got some
jacked paintings? Yeah, sure, the
Sheik’s a fuckin' art lover!’ Stolen
securities, bullshit CD’s? Just what
the camel-jockey ordered! You see
where this is going? The Sheik can be
all things to all hustlers --- a scam
for all seasons...

BOYLE

(incredulous)
The bullshit with you is so constant
it gets to be a kind of a truth.

MEL

Whatever Boyle, I been lining things
up. Just say the word and I can deliver
twelve buy-busts for you by the end

of the day --- all cock solid cases.

 

Reeling, Boyle shakes his head in furious disbelief.

BOYLE
Are you out of you're fucking mind!?
Everything you do, EVERYTHING has to
be authorized before you do it ---

MEL
You said you wanted five cases, I got
you twelve.

BOYLE
This isn't the Mel Weinberg show. You
don't decide what cases we run with.

I do.

MEL
Don’t get badge heavy with me. I
produced.

BOYLE

Produced what? I said I wanted Denato ---
34.

MEL
(gesturing to the bar)
And there he is, sitting p pretty
three hundred mil in bullshit to? 5 ---

Following Mel's line of Sight to the bar Boyle sees TONY DENATO,
a hefty, hatchet-faced fuck with a wandering left eye.

BOYLE
You're approaching him here, now?

MEL
I was until you walked in ---

BOYLE
Well then I’m going with you.

MEL
C’mon, Boyle, that’s retarded. Guy's
gonna take one look at your choirboy
ace and know ---

BOYLE
Know what? He knows only what you
tell him, fuckstick ---
(off Mel's look)
Look, Weinberg, this isn’t the first
time I’ve been under. I know how to
handle my shit ---

MEL
Here’s how Yong handle your shit, Boyle.
You say not follow my lead and
let me do all the talking. But if you
gotta speak only three things should
e coming out of your mouth: yes, no,
or none of your fuckin' business.

Mel takes out a pair of sunglasses and puts them on Boyle.

MEL (CONT'D)
And leave these on no matter what.
(to Proprietor)
I’ li be back, ; Just keep doin' what
you're doin'

Mel and Boyle get up and WE MOVE WITH THEM as they cut across
the restaurant to the bar --- near but not next to Denato...

MEL (CONT'D)
(shouts to BARTENDER)
Pack of Pall Malls ---

After a few beats Denato cuts over and nudges up to Mel.

DENATO

Mel ---
MEL

Hey --- Tony D --- how are you?
DENATO

Yeah, okay ---

(MORE)
35.

DENATO (CONT'D)
(gesturing to table)
So do I get to meet the Arab?

MEL
No Tony --- the Sheik doesn't wanna
talk to anyone --- that's what he's
paying me for ---

DENATO

(turns to eyefuck Boyle)
You never said anything about bringing
company ---

MEL
Yeah, well, this is, uh, James Hoyle,
a special advisor to the sheik ---

Denato gives Boyle the once over while hustling his balls ---
and then throws Mel a suspicious glare.

MEL (CONT'D)
Hey, you don’t like it? I can take
the Sheik's money down the block. But
this guy’s gotta have eyes on
everything I do.

h DENATO
Why?

MEL
Whaddya mean why? Fucking Arabs don’t
trust Jews.

DENATO
Well I guess that’s one thing the
Sheik and I have in common ---
(turns back to Boyle)
Too bright in here for your, Mr. Hoyle?

BOYLE
None of your fucking business.

Mel cringes --- but Denato chuckles.
EXT. PARKING LOT IN BACK OF STELLAS - MINUTE LATER

We MOVE with Mel and Boyle as they emerge from Stella's back
door and follow Denato through the maze of cars parked in the
alley. They approach Denato's brown Seville --- when suddenly ---

A savage, rabid-eyed, scar-ravaged PITBULL hurls itself up
against the Caddie's backseat window, in full-attack mode. Scares
the shit out Mel and Boyle --- but Denato doesn't flinch.

DENATO
My bride and joy. Fifteen bouts and
still undefeated ---

There's a blood-like substance dripping from the dog's mouth
and he stains the window with it as he tries to bite his way
through the glass.
36.

MEL
What is that shit --- blood!?

DENATO

Uh uuh. It's my own little cocktail
of hot sauce, gravy and gunpowder.
Helps maintain his heightened sense
of rage ---

(gesturing to dog)
Those steel trap jaws of his can
deliver over two thousand pounds of
pressure per square inch and once he
ocks them into some flesh, there’s
only one way to unlock them.

(motions with index Finger )
You gotta stick your finger all the
way up his ass and press on his
prostate.

(eye- fucking Mel)
You ever Stick your finger up a rabid
Pit Bull’s ass?

MEL
Uh... No. Tony I haven’t.

DENATO
Neither have I.

Denato opens his trunk, pulls out a pair of plastic gloves and
hands them to Mel who puts them on. Unlocking a steel briefcase,
Denato takes out a CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT FROM THE BANK OF
SCOTLAND. The CD is sealed in a clear plastic sleeve --- he
hands it to Mel who takes the CD out of its sleeve and carefully
inspects every aspect of it. He's impressed.

MEL
(hands CD back)
Beautiful, Tony --- really.

DENATO

I got one hundred security backed
units at a half a mila pop --- all
vouchable through Bobbie Allenwood’s
new shop in the Bahama’s ---

(grins with pride)
Stuff is so clean you’1l have at least
a six month lead before anyone figures
they’re bullshit ---

MEL
Whaddya want?
DENATO
Nine and a half on the dollar, cash.
MEL
I’ll give you four million --- for
all of it. When can you deliver them?
DENATO

(in a state of shock&awe)
Uh, couple of weeks ---
37.

MEL
Call me when they're ready and we'll
arrange the meet...

Mel and Boyle begin to head back when Denato hurriedly closes
everything up in his trunk and scurries after them.

DENATO
Hey, Mel --- Mel --- lemme ask you --
if the Arab’s really got that kind of
money, where’s he gonna put it all
once he gets it out of the desert?

MEL
Someplace where it can earn for him ---

DENATO
Atlantic City, Mel... You know they
just legalized gambling there ---

MEL
Yeah --- I spent my birthday losing
my ass at the tables at Resorts...
DENATO

You along with every other hump in

the tri-state area. Resorts is

projecting their first year drop to

e over two hundred mil. That’s more

than any joint 's ever made anywhere
1

in the story of the world.

MEL
That’11 change once some other joints
open up ---

DENATO

No, you see as things stand there
aren’t going to be any other casinos

opening up.
MEL
How is that possible?
DENATO

Jersey gaming laws require a joint be
approved twice by the Casino Control
Commission --- the first license before
they start construction and only after
they’re done, a permanent license to
operate. So here you’ve got the banks
being asked to invest 80 mil in
construction without knowing if the
casino's gonna' get their permanent
license --- and that’s all she wrote.
No one's willing to put up the money
cause of the risk of a default if the
permanent license is denied.

BOYLE
What about the Teamsters?

Mel and Denato turn to Boyle, both surprised by his sudden leap
into the discussion.
38.

DENATO
Uh uuh. Department of Labor stripped
the trustees of their control over
the pension --- (beat) Everyone’s
scrambling to find a white knight and
they’re witling to do whatever it
takes to hire his money. You could
whack up the interest rates, take a
stake in the joint, a piece of the
skim, whatever ---

BOYLE
Interesting...
MEL
(glaring at Boyle)
No. It isn't --- cause the Sheik ain’t

a schmuck and there's no way he’s
gonna risk his cash without _the
guarantee of the permanent license ---

DENATO
And what I’m telling you is that I
can get him that guarantee ---

MEL
Bullshit ---

Boyle takes off his sunglasses, his eyes wide with excitement
as he tries to read Denato.

BOYLE
How?

DENATO
I gotta guy who owns three of the key
votes on the Casino Control Commission.

MEL
Look, we're getting way ahead of
ourselves. We came here for the paper ---
I don't have the authority to get
into anything like Atlantic City ---

BOYLE
But I do.

Mel flashes Boyle a "what the fuck are you doing" look --- which
Boyle ignores.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
(to Denato)
Who’s your guy?

DENATO
Kiss my sweaty wop ass, that’s my
guy.

BOYLE
I won’t take this to the Sheik without
a name...

Denato stares at Boyle for a beat, hustles his balls and winces.
39.

DENATO
Errichetti. Mayor Angelo Errichetti.

INT. HALLWAY - FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - MANHATTAN - EARLY EVENING

Boyle waits on a bench across the hall from a closed courtroom
door. The door suddenly opens and Boyle stands as people start
to roll out --- among them, ASSISTANT US ATTORNEY JOSEPH “TOOCH”
TUCCIO. Head of the Organized Crime Strike Force for NYC's
Southern District, Tuccio is a bald and stocky man in his late
thirties

Surprised to see Boyle --- the two men approach each other when
suddenly a DEFENSE ATTORNEY gets to Tuccio first.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
Joe, can’t we work something out?---

TUCCIO
(Jersey accent)
Sure. Your client either testifies,
or he's on the bus to Marion where
he’1l be spending his days eating th the
crust out of his cellmate’s shithol

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
C’mon, my guy’s just an accountant ---

TUCCIO

So what? I’1l ask for the max, get
it, eat a ham sandwich and then come
back and do the same thing to the
next asshole I catch washing cash for
the Colombos --- and it won’t mean a
goddamn thing to me cause I’ve got
More important stuff to do with my
time, like getting my hair cut.

On that note, Tuccio walks over to Boyle who's smiling.

BOYLE
Nice.

TUCCIO
It's seven-thirty on a Friday night.
Don't you have a life, Boyle? A
girlfriend? Something?

BOYLE
I don't want the load right now. How
are things with you?

TUCCIO
Just a never-ending river of crap ---

BOYLE

(points just below eye
Know what these are? The world’s
smallest fucking tears weeping for
you. Thirty five and already head of
an Organized Crime Strike Force for
Justice --- everyone should have your
problems.
40.

Tuccio gives Boyle and smiling nod. MOVING with the two men as
they walk...

TUCCIO
What’re you doing here?
BOYLE
Angelo Errichetti, the Mayor of Camden ---
TUCCIO
What about him?
BOYLE
You tell me.
TUCCIO

Errichetti's about as heavy as they
come in Jersey ---

BOYLE
Guy's the fucking mayor of Camden ---
how much weight can he possibly carry?

TUCCIO
Factor in that he's also the most
owerful senator in the state
egislature and the backroom boss of
the Jersey Democratic machine... And
I’d say a lot...

BOYLE
What about Errichetti's connections
in Atlantic City?

TUCCIO
He's Resorts International's velvet
steamroller --- one of the ke

legislators that got the gamb1ing
referendum passed in Jersey ---

BOYLE
You think he helped Resorts get their
casino license?

TUCCIO
Somebody did.

BOYLE
Why do you say that?

TUCCIO
Everyone knows Resorts was started by
Meyer Lansky's group --- shit, as we
speak the Bahamian government is trying
to expropriate Resorts' Paradise Islan
Hotel for everything from money-
laundering to tigging games. And yet
in spite of all of the overwhelming
evidence against them, Resorts not
only gets a casino license, they get
it before anyone --- ?

Tuccio can see Boyle's wheels turning...
41.

BOY
Got any old Jersey ‘Suddies that can
give us the inside and out on
Errichetti?

TUCCIO
Sure, I know a guy in the A.G.'s office ---
but what's going on Jimmy? What are

you into?
BOYLE
(flips Tuccio a quarter)
Give him a call -- find out what you

can -- and then I’1l buy you that ham
sandwich and tell you all about it.

INT. SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - LONG ISLAND - DAY

MEL
(restrained rage)
You guys are un-fucking-believeable!

CLOSE ON MEL at a_table in an upscale restaurant, eating shrimp
cocktail as he talks. Also present are Boyle, Tuccio, Grosswald,
Ackerman and Polk, but they aren’t eating.

MEL (CONT'D)
I put myself out on the line, spend
my own money setting up a scam that
gets you Denato --- and now you wanna
piss it all away!?

BOYLE
We’re not pissin' it away, we’re just
doubling down on Denato for Errichetti ---
MEL
Well then Denato should count as one
of my busts. What's right is right,
Boyle.

Boyle looks to Tuccio who nods --- then Boyle nods to Mel.

MEL (CONT'D)
(gesturing to Tuccio)
Who the fuck are you again?

TUCCIO
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tuccio ---
I run the Organized Crime Strike Force,
Southern District.

BOYLE
Just think of him as my lawyer ---

This discussion is interrupted by a ruckus at the next table
where a DOUCHEBAG BERATES HIS WIFE. This continues throughout
the scene. They are all annoyed, but do nothing.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
I want Errichetti, Mel ---
42.

MEL
Yeah? I wanna tit-bang Racquel Welch
while eatin a Porterhouse steak --
still don’t mean it’s ever gonna

happen.
A WAITER arrives with Mel’s main course and puts the dish in
front of him --- it’s a lobster missing its right claw.

MEL (CONT'D)
Hey, what happened to the other claw?

WAITER
Maybe he lost it in a fight with
another lobster...

MEL
(hands waiter the plate)
Well then bring me the fucking winner.

TUCCIO
Denato said he’d set up the Errichetti
meeting ---

MEL

We're supposed to give the guy four
mil for his paper end of next week
He ain’t gonna set up anything till
he sees his.

GROSSWALD
f mon, we all know you could stall
im ---

MEL
Even if I could, still wouldn’t matter.

BOYLE
Why not?

MEL

Cause Errichetti’s been playing his
game and winning since you were
shittin’ yellow.

(off Boyle’s look)
First thing he’s gonna do is check
you out. Wi addya think’s gonna happen
when it comes back that James Hoyle
don’t exist?

ACKERMAN
I could call Bill Tager in Undercover
Safeguards. See if he can rush a full
package job for us. Backstopped
onafides, creds...the works.

MEL
You guys just don’t get it? Only way
to bag an elephant like Errichetti is
to give him the big show ---

GROSSWALD
For those of us that don’t speak
fucking mutt, you wanna translate?
43.

MEL
A con’s nothing more than a big
Broadway show. I’m talking about living
theater with sets and props, costumes
actors, special effects. I mean Boyle
you saw it for yourself when you came
to my shop.

POLK
It didn’t take a Broadway show to
nait you, just some good old hard
work.

MEL
Polk, better to keep your mouth shut
and just look stupid than open it and
remove all doubt.

POLK
Hey, up yours mister ---

Mel just laughs and shake his head...

BOYLE
Will you stop with him and stay on
point.
ME

If you get the meet with Errichetti,
where are you gonna have it?

ACKERMAN
What difference does it make?

MEL
You're supposed to be repping a
billionaire Sheik. Errichetti’s gonna
expect the Presidential Suite at the
Ritz or a swank office. He’s gonna
wanna experience the Sheik’s wealth
and through it the magnitude of his

own impending good fortune --- and
for that you need a stage.

BOYLE
Say we could figure something out ---

MEL
Fine. Now where are you gonna get the
money to convince him?

TUCCIO
The bribe money won't be a problem ---

 

MEL

I'm not talking about the bribe money,
I talking about the convincer.

(off everyone's clueléssness)
For Errichetti to be convinced that
the Sheik's real enough to bankroll
casino construction you gotta show
him that the Arab’s sittin_on hundreds
of millions in cash. Actual cash.
44.

BOYLE
Couldn’t we mock-up some bank account
statements ---?

MEL

Fuckin' account statements? Whaddya
in the second grade? Before he ever
agrees to get in a room you gotta
assume Errichetti’s gonna call the
bank, verify the Sheik’s deposits.

ACKERMAN
(after a beat
Good friend of mine from college is
now the Senior VP at Chase Manhattan ---

BOYLE
Can you trust him?

Ackerman nods. The men exchange a look of resolve and then turn
to Mel for a sign of encouragement -- but get none.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
Come on Mel, this can work...

The wife of the Douchebag at the table next to them succumbs to
her husband’s abuse and egans to cry hysterically --- just as
the waiter delivers Mel’s lobster

Overloaded by the insanity, Mel looks over to the crying wife,
looks at the lobster, looks up at the agents -- disgusted.

MEL
All my life I been lookin' over my
shoulder worried about the Feds, and
for what? If I knew how fuckin’ stupid
you guys really were I woulda stole
the world.

And with that, Mel stands up and as he does, he accidentally-on-
purpose KNOCKS HIS DRINK, spilling it on the Douchebag.

DOUCHEBAG
WHAT THE HELL!?---

MEL
Oh, I am so sorry. Total accident. I
feel terrible. Listen, I’1ll tell ya
what, let me buy lunch --
(Mel cuts Douche off)

No, I insist --- I’m taking care of

everything. What’s your name?
DOUCHEBAG

Ted.

MEL
Okay, Ted, I’m gonna talk to the
maitre’d. So when you see me point
you out to him just wave your hand so
e knows who I’m paying for. Ok?

DOUCHEBAG
Yeah okay sure, thanks.
45.

We MOVE with Mel and the others as they cut to the front of the
restaurant. Mel quickly flashes a look at the MAITRE'D’s nametag
as he approaches ---

MEL
Hey Michael, you see that guy sitting
there --- my good friend Ted?

(points to Douche)
Ted lost a little bet so he’s picking
up my tab for lunch today, okay?

When Mel and the Maitre'D look at the Douche, he waves back at
them --- smiling and nodding his head.

MAITRE’D
No problem.

Mel gives the Maitre'D a smile and exits. Boyle and Tuccio
standing in the doorway, having witnessed the whole thing.

BOYLE
Hey, you can’t do that ---

MEL
No, you can’t do that. And that’s why
this will never work.

Mel blows past them and heads for his car...
EXT. PARKING LOT - SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - LONG ISLAND - CONTINUOUS
We MOVE with Boyle and Tuccio as they head for theirs...

TUCCIO
He's got a point, Jimmy --- Bureau’s
experimented with this kind of thing
before, it’s always ended in disaster.

Boyle stops and squares off with Tuccio.

BOYLE

I'm well aware of the risks on this
one. But I mean, you yourself said
that Errichetti's corrupt as fuck ---
a king's man to Resorts and the Lansky

roup --- and we both know that the
amilies are moving into Atlantic
City. This could be our backdoor into

all of it.

TUCCIO
Maybe --- but that's swinging for the
bleachers --- and right now, you've

got Tony Denato set up for a buy bust
that'll put him away for a dime. Make
you look like a_ superstar. You really
want to risk all that for the "what-
if" of Errichetti?

BOYLE
You don't think I can handle it.

TUCCIO
It's not that ---
46.

BOYLE
(angry) . .
Then why are you coming at me like
this?!
TUCCIO

Because I'm your friend. (beat) There
are consequences to taking a shot at
a heavy like Errichetti and missing.
Now me, I'm not afraid to do it. I'm
a lawyer. I've got options beyond my
tour at Justice --- But the Bureau is

your life Jimmy ---

BOYLE
So what?

TUCCIO
So you’re thirty years old and already
on your way. In ten years you have a
good shot of becoming a big swinging
Bureau dick ---
(nods to Grosswald by car)
Now you see Grosswald over there?

He’s the same age as you --- and in
ten years he’s got a chance to be
forty.

(locks eyes with Boyle)
I don’t want you to end up being the
guy with a great future behind hil

EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - MANHATTAN - NIGHT
We gaze across 5th Ave., at the elegant Plaza Hotel.
SUPER: “March 10th, 1979”

INT. ROOM - COMMAND POST - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

The small hotel room has been converted into the operation’s
makeshift command center.

Ackerman and Grosswald are quietly conferring in the corner
Behind them, Tuccio and an FBI TECHIE are at a table on top of
which are two TV monitors connected to two video recorders.

ON EACH OF THE MONITORS: A crude, low resolution, black & white
image being telecast via a pinhole camera secretly laced in
the suite adjoining this hotel room. We can see Boyle, Polk and
a few FBI TECHIES moving about.

TUCCIO
(anxious, to Techie)
Can you brighten up this image so we
can use these tapes at the trials?
(looks back to Grosswald)
What's the ETA on Errichetti?

GROSSWALD
Thirty-forty minutes...

Tuccio puts on headphones connected to monitors, nudges Techie.
47.

TUCCIO
I can't hear anything...

Techie adjusts volume and we suddenly HEAR Mel's voice over the
headphones.

MEL (HEADPHONES)
--- Fuckin' joke! I ask for champagne
and caviar and you gimmee chopped-
liver, Shlitz, and the shittiest suite
in the joint.

INT. SUITE - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

The living room area of this shoe-box suite is so small and
awkwardly shaped it's laughable.

MEL
Best thing I can say about you guys
is that you're cheap ---

Mel suddenly catches sight of something --- grabs a small stack
of paper off the desk and angrily holds it up.

MEL (CONT'D)
What the fuck is this!?

POLK
It’s the sheik’s stationary...

MEL
You think a billionaire Sheik is gonna
have his stationary printed on Xerox
paper?! Shit no! Egyptian cotton! Two
pound, four ply, Ivory Monarch.
Embossed, motherfucker!

BOYLE
Will you calm down? It’s nothing ---

MEL
No, it’s everything Boyle. Get it
through your thick fucking skulls ---
It’s all in the details!

Mel drops the stack of paper on on the desk and STORMS out of the
room. Boyle flashes Polk a look

BOYLE
Lose the paper.
INT. ROOM - COMMAND POST - PLAZA HOTEL - A LITTLE LATER
Everyone in a pregame huddle.

TUCCIO
Alright, Mel, the rules of entrapment ---

MEL
(rolling his eyes)
Jesus, how many times you gonna break
my balls about this?
48.

BOYLE
Just shut up and give it to him will
you?

MEL

(annoyed, reciting by rote)
It's okay to put out the honey pot by
tellin trric etti we're gonna pay
him off for certain favors. But I
can't induce him to commit specific
illegal acts. The flies gotta come to
the honey pot outta their own volition.

TUCCIO
Exactly --- without a clean admission
we’ve got nothing. So before any money
gets handed to Denato, Errichetti
needs to make it clear that he’s the
one ultimately getting the payort in
exchange for the casino license.

POLK
Uh --- the payoff isn’t being made
directly to Errichetti?

MEL

Lemme explain Bob, cause it's obvious
that you're dumber than a box of
fuckin' hair --- Denato's the Mayor's
bagman, his insulation ---

(off Polk's cluelessness)
If we try to give the money directly
to the Errichetti we’1l blow the whole
show.

Suddenly, we HEAR an AGENT over a WALKIE-TALKIE ---

FBI AGENT (OVER WALKIE TALKIE)
Control, the package is in the lobby.

The room EXPLODES with FRANTIC ACTIVITY, everyone rushing into
position. Tuccio hustles Boyle, Polk and Mel to the door.

INT. SUITE - PLAZA HOTEL - MINUTES LATER

Mel is anxiously pacing --- Boyle and Polk are sitting ona
couch together.

There is a KNOCK at the door and everyone stiffens up as Mel
answers it revealing: Tony Denato and MAYOR ANGELO ERRICHETTI.
With his handsome, Sinatra-esque appeal, Errichetti exudes the
kind of raw, unapologetic bravado and power reserved exclusively
for a backroom boss.

MEL
(shakes with Denato)
Tony --- how are ya?
(shakes with Errichetti)
Pleasure to finally meet you in person
Mr. Mayor --- Mel Weinberg.

ERRICHETTI
It's Angie, Mel --- please.
49.

Mel ushers the men into the room, and by the look on their faces
it becomes very clear to everyone that they are not onl
unimpressed by the chickenshit set up, but put off by it.

Boyle and Polk approach --- greeting Denato and the Mayor with
smiles and handshakes.

a DENATO ;
And this is James Hoyle, special
advisor to the Sheik.

ERICHETTI
James, beltway buddies of mine speak
very highly of you. West Point into

Military Intelligence --- then DIA.
Impressive resume for such a young
man.

BOYLE

Thank you, Sir ---
INT. ROOM - COMMAND POST - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
Everyone crowded around the monitors --- headphones on.

BOYLE (ON MONITOR)
(gesturing to Polk)
And this is Bob Dolk, President of
Abdul Enterprises, the Sheik’s
investment company.

ERRICHETTI (ON MONITOR)
Bob, I understand you’re an alum of
HBS?

ON MONITORS: Polk hesitates, unsure of what he's talking about.

TUCCIO
(under breath)
Harvard Business School. Harvard
Business School...

ERRICHETTI (ON MONITOR)
(off Polk’s silence)
Harvard Business School.

POLK (ON MONITOR)
Oh, yes. Of course. Class of 63.

INT. SUITE - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

As the men take their seats, Polk retrieves an ATTACHE CASE and
gracelessly places it on the coffee table in front of Errichetti ---
and then sits himself. Mel restraining his irritation at Polk.

Mel can see Errichetti's not sure what to make of any of it,
his face a mixture of bewilderment and discomfort.

MEL
So I assume Tony’s explained what the
Sheik’s intentions are here.
50.

ERRICHETTI

He has, Mel. And let me just say that
I welcome and appreciate the Sheik’s
interest in Atlantic City; which I
believe is one of the greatest
investment opportunities in the world
today. Beat), Wanna know why?

off Mel's nod)
Cause life for Americans is always
becoming, never being. Al Einstein
said that, he was a fucking genius.
And because it's only a_short piece
from Philly, New York, Boston,
Baltimore --- AC gives more gamblers
a chance to become somebody than any
other place on Earth.

BOYLE
The Sheik couldn't agree with you
more, and is eager to get involved.

MEL
Provided that he can overcome certain
obstacles ---

ERRICHETTI

If the Sheik does the right thing,
there won't be any obstacles, only
opportunities...

MEL
(gesturing to attache)
He's ready and willing to put his
consideration for you on the table,
Angie. But we’d like to know how it's
gonna work for him ---

DENATO
Fellas, we’ve discussed this in detail---

POLK
(stiffly interrupting)
Mr. Denato, if you please, we’ve only
discussed this with you. Now we have
a hundred thousand dollars for Mayor
Errichetti and we need to hear from
the Mayor exactly how he intends to
guarantee us the casino licenses ---

DENATO
No, you please. I thought ya did hear
And if you didn’t, ya should have,
cause we’ve been over it enough times ---

In a calming gesture, the Mayor puts his hand on Denato.

ERRICHETTI
Look, Bob, first rule in politics is
never make a promise you can’t keep.
Now I’ve been in public office for
over thirty years because I always
abided by that rule --- and I give
(MORE )
51.

ERRICHETTI (CONT'D)
you my word --- the Sheik will get.
everything that he needs in Atlantic
City. Alright?

INT. ROOM - COMMAND POST - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Everyone’s eyes glued to the TV MONITORS --- when suddenly Polk
for no apparent rhyme or reason, stands up...

TUCCIO
The hell is he doing?!

 

INT. SUITE - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

 

Polk awkwardly grabs the attache case, leans forward --- but
instead of handing it to Denato, he attempts to hand it directly
to Errichetti --- who sits there motionless, refusing to even
acknowledge the existence of the case.

DENATO

(tries to take case)
That’s supposed to go to me.

... But Polk won’t let him have it --- and once again attempts
to hand it to Errichetti, who is visibly put off.
MEL
Bob, whaddya doing? Give Tony the
case.
POLK
But this money’s for the Mayor.
DENATO

(still grabbing for case)
I’1l make sure it gets to the right
place.

Refusing to relinquish the money to Denato, Polk jerks the case
back towards himself at which point Errichetti’s had enough.
Disturbed and pissed, he stands up, grabs his coat.

ERRICHETTI
I thought everyone here had an
understanding. Clearly you don’t.

And with that, Errichetti walks out of the room...
INT. ROOM - COMMAND POST - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

 

Everyone frozen in horror. Tuccio has his hands on his head ---
if he had any hair, he’d be pulling it out right now.

TUCCIO
This is not happening.

DENATO (ON MONITOR)
What the hell is wrong with you people?
We had an agreement---
52.

MEL (ON MONITOR)
getting up . .
Lemmee go talk to Angie --- I’1ll fix
everything. Sit tight.

ON MONITORS: Mel rushes out of the room.

DENATO (ON MONITOR)
. (to Polk)
This how they teach you to do deals
at Harvard?

EXT. ENTRANCE - PLAZA HOTEL - MINUTE LATER

Mel exits the hotel and catches up to Errichetti who is about
to hail a cab.

 

MEL
Hey, Angie --- I’m sorry about how
that went down. It was a total
misunderstanding ---

ERRICHETTI
Misunder standing? I can’t afford to
do business with people that don’t
know how to do business.

MEL
Yeah, yeah, I know. But you gotta
realize Dolk and Hoyle, these guys
are squares, alright? Barefoot pilgrims ---
and Dolk was just following orders
from up on high.

ERRICHETTI
The Sheik told him to do that?

MEL
Yeah. Ragheads don’t like to deal
with middlemen. Everything’s direct.

ERRICHETTI
Well we’re not in the Middle East ---

MEL

Angie, don’t be a shmuck. I know you
called Chase about the Sheik’s
deposits. So you know the Arab’s got
over four hundred million friends in
the bank there. You really wanna turn
your back on that kind of money?

(off Errichetti’s silence)
Look, I’m not supposed to tell you
this, okay? But the Sheik’s got big
plans for Atlantic City. Much bigger
than simply financing one joint.

ERRICHETTI
Whaddya mean?
53.

MEL
He wants to own the entire town: buy
all the choice casino sites and then
offer would-be owners prepackaged
deals at whacked up prices. Everything
wrapped up in a bow: the land, the
financing, and the gambling licenses.

Mel sees Errichetti's hardened face soften with greed --- and
moves in close for the kill.

MEL (CONT'D)
All the deals would flow through you
and you'd get a piece, a serious piece,
at both ends.

(locks eyes)

But first we gotta grease you, and
then your casino commissioners
directly. No middle men, no builshit.
It’s the Arab way, Angie

ERRICHETTI
(after a beat)
What about Denato?

MEL
Up to you. He’s your guy, comes out
of your pocket ---- or not.

Errichetti stands in silence, not sure what he's going to do.

INT. SUITE - PLAZA HOTEL - MINUTES LATER

Denato, Polk and Boyle sit in an uneasy silence. Mel enters the
Study and breaks the anxious trance.

MEL
rony, I tried talking to him. He
wouldn’t listen. Maybe you can get
him back in the room?

DENATO
Where is he?

MEL
I think he caught a cab to Penn Station ---

DENATO
Jesus Christ.
(getting up gesturing)
Gimme the case, I 11“see what I can
oO.

MEL
Get him back in here, lemme make sure
everything’s okay, and the case is
yours. You got my word on that.

Denato storms out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
Collapsing into a chair, Boyle deflates in "fuck me" defeat.

MEL (CONT'D)
I swear to God Polk, if it was raining
pussy you’d get hit by a cock...
54.

__ MEL (ON MONITOR)
--- I mean, if you knew nine more
things, you'd be a fuckin' idiot ---

BOYLE (ON MONITOR)
Shut up, Mel ---

Tuccio angrily TURNS OFF the volume on the monitors.

TUCCIO
Fucking disaster. Unmitigated disaster ---

INT. SUITE - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

MEL
--- You're a double threat --- can't
hold your tongue or your booze ---
POLK

You don't know what you're talking
about Mister!

MEL
Oh no? You think eating onions is
enough to cover that stink coming

outta your mouth ---?
Polk finally snaps with anger and lunges for Mel --- but Boyle
is already there to stop him.
POLK
I’m sorry Jimmy--- I didn’t --- we
didn’t have the admission ---
MEL

We had a deal! Had you just stuck to
it and given the case to Denato, I
woulda gotten you the admission ---

BOYLE
Will you back off?

MEL
He has no business being on stage.
with us and you know it. I want him
out ---

BOYLE
Out of what?! Our hand’s been played,
we blew it. It's over.

MEL
I'm glad you feel that way Boyle ---
Mel lights a cigarette, takes a drag and flashes Boyle a grin ---

MEL (CONT'D)
Cause as soon as you can accept the
possibility of loSing philosophically,
you automatically improve your chances
of winning.
55.

Boyle looks at Mel quizzically. Suddenly there is a KNOCK at
the door. Boyle seizes up.

INT. ROOM - COMMAND POST - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

 

A dejected Tuccio quietly confers with Ackerman and Grosswald.
Grosswald looks over at the monitors and sees Errichetti walking
back into the room.

GROSSWALD
(SCREAMING WHISPER)
Look --- Errichetti’s back ---!!!!
Everyone RECOILS back into action --- rushing over, putting
headphones on --- as Errichetti marches back into the room,

takes the attache case and sits down with a broad smile.

ERRICHETTI (OVER HEADHONES)
Bob, James... Mel’s explained
everything to me. So I’m gonna tell
you in no uncertain terms, here, now ---
I’m in.

INT. SUITE - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

ERRICHETTI
I’1l_ deliver the casino commissioners
the licenses, zoning variances, union
concessions --- everything the Sheik
needs will be his cause I’m gonna be
his fucking rabbi. I tell you ---
without any bit of imagination or
whatever have you --- Atlantic city;
the fucking town is ours.

MEL
So what's the next step?

ERRICHETTI
(getting up to leave)
Just sit tight --- I'll have things
rolling in a week.

An amazed Boyle flashes Mel a subtle grin --- his eyes filled
with rekindled excitement and deep gratitude.

INT. ROOM - COMMAND POST - PLAZA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Everyone staring at the screen with dumbstruck smiles --- like
they just witnessed some incredible magic trick.
ACKERMAN
Have we given this op a name yet?
TUCCIO

Yeah. ABSCAM.
INT. NYC METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - KING TUT EXHIBITION - DAY
LONG SHOT OF AN EGYPTIAN PHARAOH’S TOMB: This massive museum

 

gallery has been done up like a set from Cleopatra --- the
artifacts from King Tut’s tomb on display. A river of museum
PATRONS flow down the gallery’s concourse towards us --- everyone

stopping to look at the treasures.
56.

Although we can’t see them yet... the VOICES OF MEL AND MAX can
be HEARD over the din of the crowd.

MAX (0.S.)

You're really sick, you know that?
MEL (0.S.)

Sick how?
MAX (0.S.)

Doesn’t really matter if you’re
hustling for yourself or the Feds,
does it? You just love the action
like a junkie loves his dope.

MEL (0.S.)
Hey, if I’ve got action, it’s like
anything’s possible.

We suddenly see Mel and Max emerge from the crowd --- they stroll
down the gallery and peruse the artifacts...
MAX

Just because they’re forcing you to
play doesn’t mean you have to win.

MEL
only the existentially terrified play
reak even, Max --- and besides ---

I'm telling you, this thing was like
“springtime or Hitler.” It shouldn’t
have worked but it did.

ckling)
When he took the cash and declared,
even I couldn't believe it.

MAX
Oh no?
MEL
To hook a gmar tly like Errichetti
with the p ay we made --- ?
‘cht ling)

Boyle went crazy. Thinks I'm Harry-
fucking-Houdini. Kid was so happy he
takes me out for a porterhouse at
Peter Luger' S everything on him. You
believe that?

MAX
(stops to confront Mel
So that's why you never showed up
last night? Because you were bouncing
with your new playmate?

MEL
Guy invited me out to dinner... what
was I supposed to do?

MAX
Tell him to fuck off and die! This is
the prick that ruined our lives!
57.

MEL
The kid's just doin' his job. It's
not personal.

MAX
Yes it is. It couldn't be more
personal.
Max resumes her stride, her face filled with anger... Mel gently
grabs her by the arm and stops her.
MEL

What is it with you? You've been acting
crazy for the last few months and
it's just getting worse.
MAX
I don't want to do this here.

MEL
You don't wanna do what?
(off her silence)
Come on Max. Talk to me.

Mel sees that Max's eyes are filled with an intense fear.

MEL (CONT'D)
What is it?

MAX
(after a beat, looks away)
I need some space --- away from you.

Mel is caught completely off guard by this revelation and it
takes a few beats for it to fully register..

MEL
So I'm out here on the wire doin'
what I'm doin' cause of you ---
MAX
(angrily interrupting)
Oh don't even go there Mel! You're
doing this for yourself!

And with that, Max storms off and out of the gallery.
EXT. FRONT STEPS - METROPOLITAN ART MUSEUM - MINUTE LATER

Max emerges onto the museum steps. Mel chases her down.

MEL
Max, please. You're the only erson I
can be myself with --- the only one I

can talk to without having to think
about what I'm gonna say first ---

MAX
You can pay a shrink fifty bucks an
hour to do that...

MEL
Come on. You know what I mean.
58.

MAX
No, I don't.
(locks eyes with Mel)
What are we without the scam? What am
I to you? A great fuck? A shoulder to
cry on? (beat) Seriously Mel, what am
I to you?

We can see the intense fear in Max's eyes spread to Mel's.

MEL
(flustered)
I don't know. I mean, what am I to
you?
MAX

I asked you first.

Tears well up in Max's eyes as she waits for Mel to answer. But
he can't.

Leaving Mel on the steps, Max gets into a cab and disappears.

EXT. HILTON HOTEL - JFK AIRPORT - NIGHT
Gazing at a massive hotel located next to the airport.

MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
...AS Vice Chair of the Casino
Commission, I have tremendous sway
over every aspect of the licensing
process ---

INT. SUITE - HILTON HOTEL - JFK AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

Boyle, Polk, Mel, Errichetti --- and KENNETH MACDONALD, VICE
CHAIR OF N.J. CASINO COMMISSION --- sit around a coffee table...

ERRICHETTI
And he's here to help us...

MEL
We're glad to hear that ---

BOYLE
(Hands bag of cash to
_ Macdonald)
phe Sheik appreciates people that can
elp.

MACDONALD
I’1l talk to two of my fellow
commissioners. You’1l be able to make
the same arrangement with them ---
which gives you all the votes you
need.

ERRICHETTI
And the first package I’d like us to
bring to the Sheik is a deal to buy
and revamp the old Shelburne Hotel ---
(MORE )
59.

ERRICHETTI (CONT'D)
(hands Mel pictures and
setup of property)
We can turn it into the swankiest
joint in A.C. and do it for half the
cost than anyone else.

MEL
How?

ERRICHETTI
I've given Harrison Rand a piece of
the action to fix things...

Boyle and Mel flash each other a quick look of astonishment...

BOYLE
Do you mean Senator Harrison Rand?

Errichetti nods. Boyle and Mel's astonishment quickly shifts to
restrained excitement...

ERRICHETTI
Harry’s gonna push some buttons and
get a declaratory ruling that’1l allow
us to renovate the property instead
of tearing it down and Starting over.

That'll save forty mil right o the
top.

MEL
No shit?

MATCH CUT TO:
CLOSE ON TV PLAYING SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM SUITE:
The timecode on the tape: “May 18, 1979.”

ERRICHETTI (ON MONITOR)
Yeah. Harry can do things for us in
Trenton and D.C. --- he's lifestyle.
He's beautiful. He's with us, okay? ---
and he’s easy to handle.

BOYLE (ON MONITOR)
What do you mean by that?

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:
INT. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - FBI HQ - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

Boyle and Tuccio are seated at a conference table watching the
TV Monitor with LAWRENCE HOUSEMAN, THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI.

SUPER: "May 23, 1979 - FBI Headquarters, Washington D.C."

ERRICHETTI (ON MONITOR)
Guy’s a lush and a whoremaster. Harry’d
fuck a snake if you held its head for
him. He’s good people ---
60.

HOUSEMAN
(disgusted)
Just turn it off. I've read the
transcripts ---

Tuccio STOPS the tape. An uneasy silence overtakes the table.
We can see that Tuccio and Boyle are both very nervous in the
presence of Houseman and look a little out of their depth.

Houseman LIGHTS a cigarette, takes an anxious drag.

HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
Errichetti’s claims about Rand...?

BOYLE
Yes sir. We think they're credible.
There’s too much money at stake for
him to lie to us.

HOUSEMAN
You know Rand's not only the fourth-
ranking Democrat in the Senate, he's
the co-chair of CJS Appropriations...
(off their blank looks)
That's the Subcommittee that controls
our budget.

TUCCIO
If Rand's involved in influence
peddling, it’s a federal crime---

HOUSEMAN
I'm well aware.. But I also have to
be mindful that Congress is a vengeful
institution and will see this
investigation as an attack.

BOYLE
This isn’t the first time we’ve
targeted political corruption.

HOUSEMAN

It’s the first time we’ve used such a
radical approach...

(gets up and paces)
You're talking about pushing the
envelope of inducement with the man
that controls our purse strings ---
and the guy who you've positioned to
run point is a criminal whose stock
and trade is bullshit!

BOYLE
All due respect, but Mr. Weinberg’s
gift for bullshit is precisely why
we've been so successful.

HOUSEMAN
Are you telling me that you actually
trust Weinberg?

BOYLE
a telling you that I can control
im.
61.

Staring Boyle down, Houseman lets that hang in the air fora
few beats. He then takes a seat at his desk and reviews a file.

HOUSEMAN

So Rand has agreed to take a payoff?
BOYLE

That's what we've been told --- but

the caveat is that the Senator won't
take until he meets the sheik face to
ace.

TUCCIO
We found an agent out of the Chicago
office of Saudi descent who we think
can play the part.

HOUSEMAN
When and where will the meet take
place?

TUCCIO

Well, what's being discussed isn't
exactly a meeting, sir. (beat) Mayor
Errichetti wants to throw a coming-
out party for the sheik in Atlantic
City.

 

HOUSEMAN
(incredulous)
A coming out party?

BOYLE
Along with the Senator, all the key
players would be there; casino owners
union leaders, politicians, organized
crime elements ---

TUCCIO ;
It could be an intelligence jackpot
for us ---

Houseman leans back in his chair, anxiously runs his hands
through his hair.

HOUSEMAN
What kind of resources would you need?

BOYLE
We'd need you to designate Abscam a
"Bureau Special"

HOUSEMAN
(after a considered beat)
You'll coordinate everything through
my office --- and I want to see al.
of your intel as it becomes available ---
(looks at Tuccio)
But I trust you'll be circumspect
about what it is you're showing me.
Are we clear?

; TUCCIO
Yes sir.
62.

HOUSEMAN
Fine. Now go to work.

Tuccio and Boyle stand up to leave.

BOYLE
Sir, there is one more thing. Mayor
Errichetti has requested that the
sheik deposit two million dollars in
an account at his friend's bank ---

TUCCIO
It would be a personal favor to the
Mayor. If do this, the bank will give
him a sweetheart loan on a house he
wants to buy in Boca Raton, Florida.

HOUSEMAN
Is this an ask or a demand?

BOYLE
It's an ask. But we think the gesture
could buy us a tremendous amount of
goodwill and credibility.

HOUSEMAN
Table it until after the party. I
want to see what the Mayor does for
us before we do for him.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MEL’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

It’s pouring rain outside. The house is still completely
unfinished. Birthday decorations in the living room.

Mel's drinking a beer and setting up a brand new Atari 2600
videogame system. We can see that he's put on about fifteen
pounds --- and the accumulated stress of the past few months ---
it's all in his face.

Hearing a car pull into the driveway, Mel rushes to turn the TV
and game on. Estelle, Willie and his TwO BEST FRIENDS come in
through the front door.

Mel smiles with anticipation as Willie, his friends and Estelle
enter the room. They're all surprised to see him. Willie flips
out over the Atari.

WILLIE
Aww man, no way! I thought my present
was the Knicks game?

MEL
Yeah well, that too. Happy Birthday
boychick.

WILLIE
(giving Mel a big hug)
Thanks Pop.

Estelle glares at Mel. The tension between them is heavy.
63.

INT. KITCHEN - MEL’S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Estelle's making sandwiches. Mel comes in, opens the fridge,
grabs another beer.

ESTELLE
I wish you wouldn't drink in front of
his friends.

EL
Come on, you don" t think they've seen
their fathers drink a beer?

Mel cracks open the beer, takes a sip.

_ ESTELLE
I thought we didn't have money for
extras --- like videogames.

MEL
We don't. But it's his birthday---

ESTELLE
Some birthday --- we can't even have
a proper party for our son --- because
I'm too embarrassed for his friends'
arents to see how we're living ---
ike a bunch of shlumps ---

MEL
You really wanna start?

The phone on the kitchen counter starts to RING. She answers.

ESTELLE (INTO PHONE)
Hello? Yeah, just a moment---

Estelle hands the phone to Mel.
MEL (INTO PHONE)

Yeah ---

(suddenly tenses up)
Tony? --- Yeah --- Why y you calling me
at ome? --- Whaddya ta

king about? ---
I can’t, it’s my kid's birthday

Why can’t this wait until tomorrow? ---
Tony, you need to calm down.

We hear Denato SCREAMING over the phone line and see Mel's face
tighten with fear.

MEL (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D)
No --- I’1l meet you someplace halfway ---
there’s a bowling joint outside
Freeport, Victory Lanes, right off
the 27 --- 5:30 --- Tony, you're laying
this on me at the last minute. I don't
know if I can get Hoyle there, he's a
busy guy ---

Mel hangs up the phone, a worried look on his face. He looks
over to Estelle, who has heard everything and is furious.

ESTELLE
I don't believe you ---
64.

You really think. fh d be doing this if
it wasn't that important?

ESTELLE
More important than your son? Your
family?

MEL
I gotta serious problem. I gotta meet
this guy ---

ESTELLE

What problem?! What guy? What are you
doing, Mel?

MEL

Oh, so now you suddenly care?
ESTELLE

I've always cared ---
MEL

Don't hand me that. My comin' and

goin' never bothered you before ---

as long as the money was rollin' in ---
but now that times are a little rough
you wanna know everything!?

Mel moves towards the door to exit the kitchen --- but Estelle
steps in front of him, preventing him from leaving.
ESTELLE

I just wanna know when it's gonna get
better, Mel. When can we finish the
house?

(locks eyes with Mel)
When are things gonna be like they

were?
MEL
Estelle, please --- it's all gonna be
okay --- but you just gotta trust me ---
ESTELLE

Trust you? Ever since you closed London
Investors, it's like you aren't even
you anymore.

; / MEL
You're being crazy.

ESTELLE

You don't think I hear you in your
office lying to those people you talk
to on the phone? Talking about the
sheik's private jets --- going to
Geneva, London? It's all lies. You're
not in business with some zillionaire
Arab Sheik.

MEL
You don't know what you're talking
about ---
65.

ESTELLE
I don't? Well then how come we're
living like we're on the edge? I mean

where's all the Sheik's hundreds of
millions?
MEL
It's locked up in the banks in his
country! I'm helpin' him get it---
ESTELLE
(cuts him off, gesturing)

Just stop.
There's a devastating silence between them.

ESTELLE (CONT'D)
Look, Mel, what you and I got, I know
it's not some big love affair ---
It's a respect for each other ---
that's what's made our marriage work

for the past fifteen years.
(tears in her eyes)

But you can't have respect without
trust.

We can see Mel wants to confess but just can't do it.

MEL
Everything that I am doing right now,
I am doing for our family.

ESTELLE
How am I supposed to know that when
I've got no idea what you're doing?

MEL
It's complicated.

ESTELLE
Then explain it to me. Give me
something.

MEL
(angry frustration)
I can't. Not right now.

Estelle stands aside to allow Mel to walk out of the room.
EXT. VICTORY LANES BOWLING ALLEY - LONG ISLAND - LATER

HIGH ANGLE OVER a bowling alley situated along a two-lane
highway. It’s still raining. We see Mel pull into the lot, park
get out of the car and enter the bowling alley.

Moments later, a brown Cadillac El Dorado rolls into the parking
lot and parks next to Mel’s car

INT. CADILLAC EL DORADO - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

We can see that Polk is strung out with anxiety. Reaching into
his glovebox, he grabs a small bottle of whiskey and takes a
few big swigs. Polk then pulls an onion out of a brown bag,
bites into it, and chews.
66.

INT. BAR - VICTORY LANES BOWLING ALLEY - MINUTE LATER

An empty shot-to-shit bar overlooking the vacant lanes. Mel
takes a seat across from Denato at a table in the back. Both
men glare at each other unhappily.

DENATO
Is Hoyle coming?

MEL
He’s in DC on business _but Dolk should
be here. And I can tell you right now
he’s not happy about the shit you’re
pulling.

DENATO
The shit that I'm pulling?! First you
fucks blow me off_on my CDs... Now I
find out your dealing directly with
Errichetti, cutting me out of the
thing that I set up --- and I’m the
asshole?

MEL
No one’s cutting you out of anything,
Tony. You just gotta understand that---

DENATO
No, you gotta understand, Weinberg...

Denato leans back to hustle his balls and reveals a belly-
holstered REVOLVER.

DENATO (CONT'D)
. That I am a guy best left unfucked
with.
MEL
Jesus. No one's gonna fuck with you.
Now put that away will ya?

They see Polk enter the far side of the lounge and approach.
Denato puts the gun in his jacket pocket.

POLK
Gentlemen ---
(takes off raincoat)
I’1l be right back, I just need to
use the john.

Hanging his coat on the chair, Polk heads for the bathroom.

MEL
Look, Tony, we’re all businessmen
here. We’re gonna get this thing
straightened out ---

Polk’s coat suddenly slides off the chair and DROPS to the
ground.
MEL (CONT'D)
...But you gotta gear down. I mean
Dolk’s a civilian, a square---
67.

CLOSE ON DENATO: he leans down under the table, out of Mel’s
line of sight and grabs the tail of the coat --- roughly picking
it up --- Causing a WALLET to fall out of a pocket.

MEL (0.S.) (cont'd
You try to put the fear on him an
flash your piece? He'll flip out --

Mel sees Denato rise back up and lock eyes with him --- a
homicidal expression on his face.
DENATO

You know I know where you hang your
hat, right Mel? Where your wife and
kid sleep?

MEL
What the fuck Tony? Why would you say
something like that?

Denato answers his question by holding up an opened wallet and

revealing --- POLK’S FBI BADGE AND ID --- his other hand is on
the gun inside his pocket and he's pointing it at Mel.
DENATO

Get up. We’re leaving.

Mel’s initial shock and horror are quickly overpowered by an
all-consuming rage -- he suddenly erupts to his feet but instead
of heading for the exit, he marches towards the bathroom.

DENATO (CONT'D)
Mel ---2?! --- Mel!!!

INT. BATHROOM - VICTORY LANES BOWLING ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE ON POLK: at a urinal stall in the midst of flushing ---
oO

when Mel suddenly and savagely smashes him face first in the
steel piping above the urinal.

 

Blood spurts out of Polk's nose as he drops to the floor ina
shellshocked daze. Mel continues his brutal beat down as he
viciously stomps Polk in the stomach and solar plexus.

Denato enters and is stunned, confused and alarmed to find Mel
whaling on the bloodied, semi-conscious FBI agent...

DENATO
The fuck you doing!?

MEL
The fuck does it look like?
(stomps Polk)
Whatever he's got, it's shit without
his testimony. Now gimme your piece.

DENATO
You_ can't whack a fucking feeb! Not
while I'm around!

MEL
Help me or not Tony --- I'm gonna
tell everyone that you did.
68.

Mel drops down to his knees, gets Polk in a strangle-hold and
begins choking him out. In a panic, Denato rushes over, grabs
from behind and pulls him off Polk ---

Using Denato's momentum, Mel drives the bastard backwards
hammers him into the sink counter --- then grabs Denato's ankles
and sweeps him off his feet --- Denato's head smacking the
counter-top as he and Mel fall to the floor

Mel flips over and tries to pin Denato down while reaching for
his pocketed gun. Denato counters the attack by grabbing Mel's
balls and squeezing --- Mel screams --- looks over to Polk who
is coming to ---

MEL (CONT'D)
Bob --- he's gotta gun...

Denato's eyes go wide with shock and fury as he suddenly realizes
that Mel's attack on Polk was bullshit.

Polk moves to help --- and Mel uses the distraction to grab the
gun out of Denato's pocket...

Denato smacks the gun out of Mel's hand --- the revolver slides
across the bathroom floor --- out of reach of everyone.

As Polk goes for the gun, Denato brutally hammers his elbow

into Mel's esophagus ---
Sputtering off of Denato, Mel struggles to breathe --- Denato
scrambles to his feet and BOLTS out of bathroom --- just as

Polk grabs hold of the gun ---
MEL (CONT'D)
(wheezes to Polk)
He's got your badge---
Polk explodes out of the bathroom in pursuit of Denato.

EXT. PARKING LOT - VICTORY LANES BOWLING ALLEY - SECONDS LATER

 

Polk blows out the backdoor, sees Denato making a mad dash for
his black Seville --- about sixty yards ahead of Polk -- and is
almost there ---

 

Polk points the gun at Denato's back and screams ---

POLK
STOP!!
Ignoring the warning, Polk watches as Denato reaches his car
and is about to grab the door ---
Polk squeezes off two quick shots --- BAM --- BAM --- the bullets
whizzing by Denato --- too close for comfort --- he FREEZES,

puts his hands up in a surrendering gesture.

POLK (CONT'D)
(screams)
Get on your knees! Lock your hands
behind your head!

Denato drops to his knees and locks his hands behind his head.
69.

As Polk begins to carefully approach Denato, Mel suddenly comes
barreling out of the bowling alley's back door.

Looking ahead, he sees Polk slowly moving in on Denato --- and
out of the corner of Mel's eye, he also sees Grosswald and
Ackerman rushing towards them from a cover car parked across
the highway, their guns in hand.

MOVING WITH POLK: He's drawing closer to Denato --- when suddenly
Denato reaches for the handle of the Seville's back door ---
OPENS IT ---

DENATO'S PITBULL EXPLODES OUT OF THE CAR like a bullet froma
gun --- and makes a rabid blitz straight for Polk ---

completely unprepared, Polk is only able to squeeze off one

SHOT at the charging dog --- which misses --- before the beast
pitches into him --- RAMMING Polk to the ground with so much
Force it causes him to drop the gun. The pit begins to viciously
maul him ---

Jumping into the Seville, Denato starts the engine and kicks up
a spitstorm of mud as he spins his car around and heads for the
ighway.

Mel, Grosswald and Ackerman rush to help Polk ---
INT. DENATO'S SEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

Denato peels out of the parking lot and just before hitting the
highway, takes a quick glance into his rear-view mirror

He sees his pit bull going berserk on Polk ---
Denato cuts a grin of pride --- just as ---

THE THUNDERING BLAST of an approaching truck's airhorn overtakes
the moment ---

Looking out his driver's side window with horror, Denato sees a
KENWORTH SEMI BARRELING TOWARDS HIM FULL BORE --- and that's
all she wrote --- there's no time for Denato to do anything but
close his eyes before THE CATACLYSMIC IMPACT...

EXT. PARKING LOT - VICTORY LANES BOWLING ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

 

As Mel, Grosswald and Ackerman continue to rush towards Polk ---

Behind them we see the Kenworth RAM INTO DENATO'S SEVILLE WITH
DEVASTATING VIOLENCE ---

Polk's screams of agony overtaken by the sounds of SCREECHING
BRAKES --- EXPLODING GLASS --- CRUMPING, SHEARING METAL ---

All three men stop to look as the semi wades deep into the
driver's side of the Seville, finally flipping it over on its
roof and sending it sliding down the rain-slicked highway...
until both vehicles finally come to a stop --- at which point ---

Polk's SCREAMS regain their attention and the men resume their
dash towards him...

ANGLE CLOSE ON POLK: He and the pit bull are wildly thrashing
about in the mud --- Polk punching and clawing the pit bull
70.

which has its jaws locked deep into his left thigh --- blood
gushing out ---

Grosswald and Ackerman are the first to arrive on the scene,
quickly followed by Mel.

POLK
GET IT OFF ME!

Grosswald tries to get a clean shot on the dog and is about to
take it --- but Ackerman suddenly stops him ---

ACKERMAN
A forty-five slug will go right through
the dog and into Bob.

GROSSWALD
What do we do?

MEL
You gotta stick your finger up its
ass, press on its prostate.

GROSSWALD
WHAT! ?

MEL
Only way to get it to unlock its jaws!
Stick your finger up its ass---

Overwhelmed by the suggestion, the agents hesitate --- and so
Mel acts. Jumping down on top of Polk and the dog he cringes
with disgust as he JAMS his finger up the pit bu i's ass and
presses as hard as he can.

The pit bull's eyes go wide with alarm, the abrupt anal intrusion
causing the dog to release its grip on Polk's thigh---

As Polk rolls out of the way, the pit bull lashes back and moves
to attack Mel --- but is stopped dead in its tracks by a BULLET
from Grosswald's gun ---

A quick beat of silence and inaction as the dust settles.

Ackerman takes his belt off, and tightens it around Polk's thigh
using it as a tourniquet.

| ACKERMAN
Just hang tight, Bob. Help's on the
way.

Mel gets up and heads for Denato's car. Grosswald follows.

ANGLE ON HIGHWAY CRASH SITE: The shaken TRUCK DRIVER is
approaching the Seville. Mel and Grosswald overtake him.

GROSSWALD
(to Trucker)
Just sit down on the side of the road
till the paramedics get here.

ANGLE CLOSE ON THE DECIMATED SEVILLE: Mel and Grosswald lean
down, look inside, and see Denato's crumpled, mutilated body
lying there motionless. Grosswald reaches in, pulls Denato
through the shattered window, then checks for a pulse.
71.

Seeing the grim expression on Grosswald's face, Mel knows that
Denato is dead. He shuts his eyes in dread and shakes his head.

GROSSWALD (CONT'D)
What the fuck happened in there?

Mel reaches into Denato's pocket, pulls out POLK'S FBI BADGE
and hands it to Grosswald.

Covered in a cold sweat and green with nausea, Mel gets up
staggers towards his car.

GROSSWALD (CONT'D)
Mel, where you going!?

Mel doesn't answer, just gets into his car and peels away.

EXT. CHELSEA HOTEL - MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT

 

Gazing down the street, we see Mel walk down the block and enter
the Chelsea.

INT. LOBBY - CHELSEA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

 

Mel holds his jacket closed, hiding his bloodstained shirt.
High anxiety in his eyes, like he's on the verge of a breakdown.

He approaches the FRONT DESK MANAGER.

MEL
Can you ring Room 708 --- Miss Gardner?

The Desk Manager, clearly put off by the state Mel's in, gives
him a suspicious glare and then looks at his guest log.

MANAGER
I'm sorry but Miss Gardner is no longer
staying with us.

This revelation hits Mel like a sledgehammer to the gut.

MEL
Whaddya mean she's not here?! When
did she check out?

MANAGER
I'm sorry sir, but we're not allowed
to divulge that information.

Mel angrily pulls out a C-Note, and slips it to the Manager

MEL
When?
| MANAGER
Five weeks ago.
MEL
Did she leave a forwarding address?
MANAGER

(after checking)
No, she did not.

Mel staggers away from the desk in shell-shocked despair.
72.

EXT. BURNSIDE BATHHOUSE - LONG ISLAND - LATER THAT NIGHT

Boyle pulls _in behind a GREY CROWN VIC which is parked behind
Mel's Lincoln. Getting out, Boyle walks over to the Vic inside
of which are TWO FBI AGENTS.

BOYLE
How long has he been in there?

DRIVER AGENT
Bout an hour ---

INT. STEAMBATH - BURSIDE BATHHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Clad in a towel, Mel sits hunched forward on a bench --- sweating
it out in the Russian Banya style steambath.

Boyle enters, also wearing a towel. He spots Mel through the
wet haze and takes a seat next to him.

BOYLE
You okay?

Mel looks up at Boyle before returning to his hunched position.

BOYLE (CONT'D)

Look, before we get into everything,
I just want to say ---

(locks eyes with Mel)
What you did, for Polk, the operation ---
you really showed us something and I
just ---
J (offers his hand, sincere)
Thanks Mel... Really...

Mel doesn't shake. Turning on the cold water tap next to him,
he fills a bucket and dunks the water over himself.

MEL
I did what I did for me and my family ---
end of story.

BOYLE
Really? What'd you pulling the pit
off Polk have to do with your family?
(off Mel's silence)
Look_man, what went down tonight was
completely fucked up --- should've
never happened ---

MEL
Tonight was pre-ordained! How many
times did I tell you about Polk?

BOYLE
And I'm taking him out of the game,
effective immediately---

MEL
Point is, he shouldn't have been
playing in the first place and you
fucking knew it ---
73.

BOYLE
Polk's got almost twenty years on the
job and I'm supposed to back you
against him!?

MEL
Spare me this bound by allegiance
crap cause I'm out here in the real
world. This is life and death and you
guys could fuck up a cup of coffee.
(dunks himself with another
water bucket)
Freak accident --- fuckin' Mack truck,
that's all that stopped things from
going from bad to worse. (beat) what
appens the next time?

BOYLE
We've been doing the best we can with
what we've got, but that's all going
to change now.

MEL
How?
BOYLE
Let's get dressed --- I want to show

you something ---
EXT. VESCO TOWNHOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Boyle parks across the street from an elegant, four story
townhouse located on 69th between Fifth Ave. And Madison.

The two men exit the car. Mel follows Boyle to the townhouse's
front door.

MEL
What is this place?

BOYLE
(unlocking front door)
Used to belong to Robert Vesco ---
Bureau seized all his assets when he
fled the country ---

INT. VESCO TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Although the place is dormant, both men are wowed by the size
and grandeur of the sumptuous Ly decorated townhouse...

MEL
What are we doing here?
BOYLE
This is our new home, the Sheik's new

home ---

(off Mel's stunned glare)
We hit the majors, Mel. ABSCAM has
been made a "BUREAU SPECIAL."

MEL
That supposed to mean something to
me?
74.

BOYLE
It means anything we want, we get.
This op is now_a top priority. Fucking
Director himself is overseeing.

Boyle takes out an envelope, hands it to Mel. Mel opens it and
pulls out a CHECK for $5,000.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
Your monthly salary ---

At first Mel is stunned --- but then he just shakes his head

with dismay.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
Hey, don't tell me it's not enough
cause that's more than twice what I
get paid...

MEL
You just don't get it, do you? The
Money ain't the issue.

BOYLE
Then what?

MEL

(after a beat)
I been a con merchant for over two
decades --- tonight was the closest
I've ever come to gettin' clipped
First time I ever Saw a guy get killed.
Thirteen years of marriage and never
once has Estelle ever suspected that
I was into anything shady --- not
until I started up with you. I mean
here I am working with the good guys
and now she thinks I'm up to no good.

And then Hey” beat
Max broke thangs off ---

BOYLE
(interrupting)
You and Max split up?

MEL
She skipped town without even n letting
me know where she was going.

BOYLE
Why didn't you say something?

MEL
Cause fuck you. That's why You_could
give a shit about the problems I got.

BOYLE
That's not true ---

MEL
So you’ re my new best friend, is that
it, le? My Compadre? I don't even
know W io you are!
75.

BOYLE
And what do you want to know? That I
come from a family of drunks? That my
hobbies are beating off, Tegestology
and taking long walks on the fucking
beach? That I got nobody and nothing
except for the job?

An awkward beat between the men...

MEL

What the hell is Tegestology?
BOYLE

Coasters. I collect beer coasters.
MEL

(amusingly disturbed)
You're right Boyle, the less I know
about you the better ---

BOYLE
Will you stop breaking my balls!?
This thing is turning into the Bureau's
biggest investigation but I can't do
it without you...

MEL
Bet that must drive you fuckin' crazy.

BOYLE
You have no idea.

MEL
Look, I appreciate you coming through
on the case-dough but ---

BOYLE
(cutting Mel off)
But what? Come on man --- what do I
need to do to make things right?

Mel flashes Boyle a pregnant look
EXT. MEL’S HOUSE - LONG ISLAND, NY - DAY

A BLACK LIMO, pulls up to Mel's house. A CHAUFFEUR gets out and
opens the door for Boyle who is clad in a sport coat and slacks.

As Boyle approaches the front door, it opens and Willie is the
first to come out dressed in a sport coat and slacks.

 

BOYLE
(shakes hands)
I'm Jimmy.
WILLIE
Willie Weinberg.
(noticing the limo)
Wow. Is that your car?
76.

MEL
(stepping out the door)
No, it's the sheik's limo. But Mr.
Hoyle here gets to use it.

WILLIE
Cool! Never been in a sheik's limo
before.

MEL

Why don't you go check it out...
Willie runs over and disappears into the limo.

MEL (CONT'D)
Glad you could make it, Jimmy.

Estelle steps out the front door looking prettier than we've
ever seen her and greets Boyle with a warm smile.

BOYLE
Hello --- I'm James Hoyle ---

ESTELLE
(eagerly shaking hands
Estelle. It's really such a pleasure
to finally meet you in person ---

MEL
Yeah, Estelle was beginning to think
you didn't exist.

ESTELLE
(embarrassed smile)
Stop it.

An awkward beat, Boyle clearly uncomfortable with the charade.

MEL
(heads towards limo)
Come on, we're gonna be late ---

ESTELLE
(following with Boyle)
Do you enjoy horse racing? Mel's just
crazy about the ponies. Never missed
opening day at Belmont since I've
known hil

EXT. BELMONT RACETRACK - DAY

VARIOUS ANGLES of opening day at Belmont Racetrack --- THE
RINGING OF THE OPENING BELL! Horses ERUPTING from the gates ---
Hooves MASHING through dirt --- scrambling and fighting for

position on the one-mile oval ---
INT. BELMONT ROOM - BELMONT RACETRACK - CONTINUOUS

An elegant, members only club/bar/restaurant --- with huge glass
windows which overlook the finish line.

Mel_ and Willie are standing at the window, watching the horses
roll into the final stretc Behind them, Estelle and Boyle are
seated at a table watching father and son as their horse comes
77.

in_--- and they both go CRAZY --- we can see this pure joy on
Mel's face to be with his son ---

An ebullient Mel and Willie come back to the table.

MEL
Can my boy pick 'em or can my boy

pick ‘em?
WILLIE
How much did we win?
MEL
Well, he was a false favorite at 6-1,
and we bet a hundred bucks... So how

you gonna figure that out, champ?
Willie trying to figure it out the math on a napkin---

WILLIE
Six hundred bucks!

MEL
You wanna collect? Or you wanna lay?

WILLIE
I roll with you Pop.

 

MEL
(smiling wink at Estelle)
We'll be back in a little while.

Boyle and Estelle watch them walk towards the betting windows.

BOYLE
It's nice to see this side of your
husband.

ESTELLE

nods)

This is the side I married.

BOYLE
He really seems like a wonderful
father.

ESTELLE

He is, when he's around ---
(pointed at Boyle)
Which hasn't been much lately ---

BOYLE
Yes, well I'm sorry about that ---
Mel's been working very hard ---

ESTELLE
Doing what, exactly?
BOYLE
Uh --- Mel helps us find worthy

business opportunities to invest in.
He's a tremendous asset to our
organization ---

(MORE )
78.

BOYLE (CONT'D)

(locks eyes with Estelle)
I'm sure you'd be very proud of the
work he's doing.

INT. CASHIER'S WINDOW - BELMONT RACETRACK - MINUTES LATER

 

Mel's waiting in line at the cashier's window with Willie.

MEL
(showing the racing form)
These are my picks for the fifth---
Whaddya think?

WILLIE
I like Daddy Longlegs.

MEL
He's a roughy! Look at the stats on
him.

WILLIE

Yeah, but his name is cool.

Mel laughs when suddenly a HAND comes down on Mel's shoulder.
Mel spins around and sees DOMINIC CASELE and SONNY BLITZ.

DOM
Hey, there he is --- openin' day at
Belmont --- I knew you were gonna be
here --- How are ya, Mel?

MEL
Okay, Dom ---

DOM

Okay's okay. You're a tough man to
get a_hold of Mel. I been reachin'
out, left a few messages.

MEL
Yeah, and I ---

DOM
When I call, it's for a reason. We
need to talk.

MEL
Look, Dom, I got my kid and the wife
with me. It's almost post time. How
bout I come down tomorrow.

DOM
No, now.
(grabbing Mel by the arm)
This won't take long. Bring the kid.

INT. PADDOCK - HORSE STAGING AREA - MINUTES LATER

 

A wide green open lawn area where the horses are saddled and

kept before post time.
As Dom paces in front of Mel --- Mel watches anxiously as Sonny
Blitz chaperone's Willie amongst the jockeys and horses.
79.

DOM
Haven't seen you_in a_long time, Mel.
Never call back let alone call ---
stopped kickin' up.

MEL
I thought you understood. I mean I
shut down London cause the heat was
all over me. Last thing I wanted to
do was get any of it near you. So I
stayed away, been laying low.

DOM
So this thing you got going with the
Arab. You call that layin' low?

MEL
No, no, Dom. You got it all wrong.

DOM
Do I? Cause I'll tell you, Mel -- few
months back when I heard about you
showin' up at Stella's with this
fuckin' sheik, whoever -- I thought
for sure you were runnin' a ringer on
a new scam. I didn't know what, but

somethin' ---
MEL
It's not like that ---
DOM

So you're going on record with me,
this deal with the Arab is legit?

MEL
Due respect, but what does any of it
gotta do with you?

DOM
I'll tell you what. I gotta call from
Somebody -- IN MY FUCKIN' LIFE -- I
never thought I'd hear from. Okay?
Never wanted to hear from. And this
somebody was askin' me 'bout you,
Mel.

MEL
Who?

DOM
Far_as you're concerned, might as
well be Satan himself! Might as well
be fuckin' God Almighty! That's who
and how heavy -- and He wants to know
if this deal with the Arab is for
real.

MEL
Dom- - -
80.

DOM
(cuts him off)

Before you open your mouth I want you
to listen. If you are into somethin'
you shouldn't be, workin' one of your
"specials". This is your one fuckin'
chance to get out clean. Just tell me
and that'll be that.

The gravity of the situation weighs on Mel as he gazes out and
sees Sonny Blitz with his son. After a long beat..

MEL
No misunderstanding Dom. I mean, we're
buying, not selling ---

DOM
So you're goin' on record with me?

MEL
Yeah, the Sheik is for real.

DOM
Okay, Mel. Well, then there are some
friends of ours that wanna have a sit
down with him when he comes in for
the Atlantic City party next month.

MEL
What friends?

DOM
The guy that called me about you ---
is the guy that runs the table --- in
Vegas, in A.C. --- everywhere...

The realization of who Dom is talking about seizes Mel like a
vice.

MEL
The Little Man?

DOM
(nodding)
Lansky's sending his heir apparent,
Arthur Zelnick to sit down with the
Sheik ---

MEL
I don't know if he'll deal directly
with these guys ---

DOM

Well then you need to explain how
things work to him Mel. If the Sheik
wants to play in A.C., he's gotta
meet with Zelnick and they gotta come
to an understanding . .

(WHISTLES at Blitz, waves

him over) .
You hear what I'm saying?

MEL
Yeah.
81.

DOM
They'11 be in touch.

Dom leaves and Blitz joins him. Willie comes over to his father
and can see that he's shaken.

WILLIE
Who were those guys Pop?

MEL
Nothing, nobodies. But let's keep
this between us.

EXT. MEL'S HOUSE - LONG ISLAND, NY - LATER THAT NIGHT

The limo is in front of Mel's house. Everyone's out of the car
Willie shakes hands with Boyle and heads for the house.

BOYLE
Estelle, it was a pleasure meeting
you. Thanks for a wonderful afternoon.

ESTELLE
I'm so glad you could join us --- and
I hope we can do this again soon.

Estelle gives gammy a hug and kiss and then trails after Willie,
letting him into the house. Then Boyle angrily snaps on Mel.

BOYLE
Can't believe I let you drag me into
your bullshit. One of the worst things

I've ever done --- like I wanna go
home and take a shower. You have a
beautiful family --- you have to tell
them Mel...

MEL
I am.

BOYLE
When?

; ; MEL

Tonight, right now --- cause I'm done
Boyle.

BOYLE
Done with what?

MEL .
You, the operation, this whole thing ---
I am out.

Boyle eyes Mel for a beat, and sees that he's dead serious ---
and suddenly his indignation shifts to alarm.

BOYLE
Is this cause of what I just said?
MEL
Dominic Casale cornered me at the
track today --- this is cause of what

HE said ---
82.

EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - WASHINGTON DC - DAY
Hard rain is falling over the DC and the FBI building.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - FBI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

Boyle, Mel and Tuccio sit silently at the table, waiting... Mel
looks about as comfortable as a priest in a pussyhouse.

On the wall behind Boyle and Tuccio is a large FBI insignia
under which are the words: "FIDELITY, BRAVERY, AND INTEGRITY."

The door suddenly swings open and in marches FBI Director
Houseman --- all business, no time to waste. Both Boyle and
Tuccio stand, Mel does not.

HOUSEMAN
Good morning gentlemen ---

Waving the men to sit, Houseman takes a seat next to Mel.

HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
I have to be on the Hill in thirty so
let's get to it, shall we?

MEL
Absolutely --- no. Fuck no.
HOUSEMAN
Excuse me?
MEL
The answer is no --- as in I am done.
HOUSEMAN

Mister Weinberg, I understand that

you have some trepidation in continuing
this operation but the work you've

been doing is important --- and given
these latest developments it's become
even more vital ---

MEL
ey, you wanna continue, I'm all for
t -- so long as it ain't with me.

HOUSEMAN

ABSCAM doesn't work without you, Mel ---
and with it we have a rare opportunity
t
c

Bex

o make a lasting impact on organized
rime and political corruption. Surely
this must mean something to you.

Mel gives Houseman a "not really" shrug.

HOUSEMAN (CONT'D

What if we were to offer you a fifteen
thousand dollar bonus for every case
you make from here on out --- plus an
additional one hundred thousand

once the trials are done ---

 
83.

MEL
There's no amount of money you can
ay me to line up against an emperor
e Meyer Lansky or his people ---
you're talkin' suicide.

HOUSEMAN
The Bureau can protect you and your
family ---

MEL
Yeah, okay --- I'll pass.

Houseman leans back in his chair and eyes Mel like a butcher
sizing up a piece of uncut meat.

HOUSEMAN
Your plea agreement specifies five
cases. You've only made four

MEL
You're right --- and if you wanna
send me to shit city, so be it ---
I'll do the three years.

HOUSEMAN
Three years? Well, when all is said
and done I think it's going to be
considerably longer than that Mel ---

Boyle and Tuccio flash each other a look, troubled by this turn.

MEL
Whaddya talkin' about? --- My sentence
stipulation was signed off on by a
Federal Judge. It's permanent.

HOUSEMAN
It's permanent, for now.

MEL
Yeah, okay, you wanna try to fuck
with my deal? Fine. I'll see you in
court.

HOUSEMAN

I have no intention of "fucking" with
your deal", but what I am going to do
is out you to every 2-0-9 on the East
coast, and make sure the street knows
that you've been cooperating with the
Bureau on several high profile 0.C.
ops. Then I'm going to contact the
editor of every major paper in the
country --- and have them run a story
about you on the front page of their
business section which will describe
in detail your criminal exploits and
accomplices --- like Miss Gardner ---
and urge anyone that's been defrauded
by one of your scams to contact the

Justice Depar tmeMonEy
84.

HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
(leans forward)
Given your talent I have no doubt the
phones will be ringing off the hook.
One month and we'll have enough cases
and evidence to put you and your
confederates away for life ---
(hardcore)
Although I doubt Dominic Casale will
ever let you get to trial.

Tuccio and Boyle are stunned and appalled by Houseman's tactics.

/ _ BOYLE
Sir, please, is this really necessary?

HOUSEMAN
(snaps at Boyle)
Yes it is Agent Boyle, but you most
definitely are not.

Mel chortles cynically and gestures to the words on the wall ---

MEL
Fidelit bravery, integrity, huh?
Buncha bullshit. ~-- ’
HOUSEMAN
It's up to you --- either continue

with ABSCAM and play to the best of
your ability or don't and suffer the

consequences ---

MEL
I don't know what makes you such a
hateful fuck, Larry --- but whatever
it is, it really works...

HOUSEMAN

I understand this is difficult, Mel ---
and I don't blame you for being upset ---
but when it comes to protecting the
foundations of our democracy ---

(dry, almost empathetic

smile) ar
...Sometimes you need to take it in
the ass for the team.

 

And with that Houseman gets up and exits --- jeaving Mel sitting
there looking like he's on the edge of a full-on meltdown.
TUCCIO
Mel ---
MEL

(muttering to himself)
I gotta get outta here ---

Mel gets up and starts staggering towards the door. Boyle jumps
out of his chair and cuts Mel off.

MEL (CONT'D)
Outta my fuckin' way or I'll lay you
out right here and now!
85.

BOYLE
Mel, you gotta believe that Joe and I
had no idea this was coming.

MEL
The fuck's the difference? It came.

Mel tries to get past Boyle and Boyle pushes him back.

MEL (CONT'D)
(desperate)
Boyle, please, I gotta get outta here.

BOYLE
Where you gonna go?

MEL
Anywhere. Somewhere. Just away from
you douchebags.

BOYLE
(after a heavy beat)
Max is at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

MEL
What---? How do you know?

BOYLE
I made some calls. Reached out to a
few people.

MEL
You did that for me?

BOYLE
Yeah. (beat) Take the rest of the
week but you got to be back on Monday.

Mel doesn't say anything, just blows out the door
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - EARLY MORNING

We see a cab pull up to the front of the big pink hotel. A VALET
opens the door and Mel gets out.

INT. FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - BH HOTEL - MINUTES LATER

As Mel strolls down the hall, looking for the right room number
he approaches a_housekeeping CART, sees a KEY RING hanging from
a hook and deftly SWIPES it.

Finally finding the room, Mel UNLOCKS the door and WE MOVE WITH
HIM as he enters...

INT. HOTEL SUITE - BH HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Mel steps into the dimly lit diving room area of the suite. A
few shafts of early morning sunlight illuminate this disaster
area_strewn with the rubble of an all night party. Champagne
bottles, dirty dishes, cigarette butts, a mirror dusted with
blow on’ the coffee table.

Looking round, Mel suddenly becomes aware of the sickening,
gargly SNORE OF A MAN EMANATING FROM THE BEDROOM.
86.

WE MOVE WITH HIM as he follows the snore into...

THE BEDROOM: Where Mel is stupefied and disgusted by the grisly
sight of MAX in bed with WAYNE NEWTON.

Both are splayed on either side of the bed, crashed out cold
and completely naked. And let me just say this before we
continue... Wayne Newton has the most disgusting bitch-titted
body you've ever seen in your life. Just fucking revolting.

Gazing at Max for a few beats, the party fatigue and depression
is evident on her face.

Mel walks over to Newton and nudges him to wake up but gets no
response. So Mel SMACKS him on the cheek. Guy sti 1 won't wake

up --- but the smack rouses Max, who leans up and is shocked
and mortified to find Mel there.
MEL

Hiya, pussycat.
MAX
This isn't what it looks like.

MEL
(bittersweet chuckle)
It never is for us, is it Max?

MAX
What are you doing here?

MEL
Well, I've been thinkin'. Thinkin'
bout that question you asked me before
you left ---

MAX
Mel ---

MEL
(cuts her off
You're my anchor. And I didn't know
it till you were gone but without you ---

I'm adrift.
ae MAX .
This is insane, you're insane --- I
mean I appreciate you telling me, but ---
MEL

But what? Look at yourself, you're
just as lost without me as I am without

you.
MAX
I'm fine ---
MEL
Come on Max. There's one mark you can
never beat --- that's the mark inside.

Mel can see Max's facade begin to break...
87.

MEL (CONT'D)
You were right about the Feebs ---
about everything ---

MAX
(bittersweet )
Well, no matter what happens in life
there's always some asshole who knew

it would --- huh Mel?
MEL
I need you Max. (beat) And I need
your help.
MAX
With what?
MEL

(sly grin, raised eyebrow)
Gettin' back to my roots. (beat) Come
back to New York with me.

A beat as Mel and Max stare at each other, silently trying to
find reconciliation in each other's eyes --- when suddenly ---

Newton, with a SICKENING SNARL, inexplicably convulses back
into consciousness and recoils into an upright position ---
terrified and confused to see Mel standing in front of him.

MEL (CONT'D)
Wayne fuckin' Newton. Man just gotta
say. You seriously have the most
disgusting body I have ever seen.

WAYNE NEWTON
Who are you?

MEL
Your arch-fuckin'-enemy.
fturaing to Max)
So whaddya say, pussycat? You hooked?

MAX
(ebullient smile)
Heavy as lead.

EXT. ATLANTIC CITY AIRPORT - ATLANTIC CITY, NJ - DAY

A stately, black Mercedes limo with diplomatic flags waits on
the tarmac --- parked in the middle of a Presidential-looking
motorcade complete with police escort.

SUPER: "July 8, 1979 - Atlantic City"

Mel, Boyle, Errichetti and four FBI Agents posing as the Sheik's
personal BODYGUARDS stand outside the limo watching as a LEAR
JET lands and begin to taxi towards them...

ERRICHETTI
The two mil I been asking you to
deposit in the Boardwalk Bank, have
you cleared it with the Sheik yet?
88.

; BOYLE
We're working on it, Angie

ERRICHETTI
You keep tellin' me that but nothin's
happening I mean what's at issue?
All I'm talkin' about is just parking
some money in an account.

BOYLE
Dolk was the issue but now that he's
been transferred to the London, things
are gonna be different.

ERRICHETTI
Well thank God for that. It's not
that I'm trying to be pushy --- but
for me to do certain things for you ---

MEL
We're gonna get the two mil for you,
Angie. You can bank on that.

ERRICHETTI
Good... So, uh, what --- how do I
address him? Your eminence?
BOYLE
They call him Shake, we call him Sheik.
MEL
Sheik --- call him Sheik ---
ERRICHETTI
I'm gonna say my friend, Hello my
friend...

The Jet pulls up to the motorcade, kills its engines, opens its
door and the stairs drop out. Boyle and Mel enter the jet.

INT. LEAR JET - CONTINUOUS

They find the FBI Agent who is playing the part of the Sheik ---
SPECIAL AGENT SAM SHADDABI, a 30-something Arab whose proud
bearing gives him a noble appeal. Shaddabi is wearing a regal-
looking keffiyeh headdress and white thobe

(For the purpose of clarity, Agent Shaddabi will be referred to
in the script as_"FBI SHEIK") Agent Ackerman and three other
FBI Agents are also on the plane.

BOYLE
_ (shakes with Fbi Sheik)
Sam, Jimmy Boyle. It's good to meet
you in person. You look terrific.
(gesturing to Mel)
This is Mel Weinberg, our 2-0-9..

The two men acknowledge each other with a nod but don't shake.

ACKERMAN
Any word on the meeting with Lansky's
guy Zelnick?
89.

MEL
It's gonna go down sometime tonight
or tomorrow but we're still waiting
on specifics. One of their people is
supposed to reach out to us...

ACKERMAN
What about Senator Rand?

MEL
Errichetti's saying he'll be there...

BOYLE
(to FBI Sheik)
Ackerman get you all up to speed?

. FBI SHEIK
(Chicago accent)
Yeah, I've been fully briefed.

MEL
Well your role is real simple. Act
stupid like you understand English
but can't speak it. Say as little as
possible and follow my lead.

FBI SHEIK
(insulted, to Boyle)
Are you running this operation or is
e?

BOYLE
Forget about it. He doesn't mean to
be an asshole, he was just born that

way, okay?

(off FBI sheik's nod)
Alright, it's showtime --- once we
step out that door, so --- anything
you'd like to go over?

FBI SHEIK
Yeah, I'd just like to say that I
think the name and premise of your
operation is fucking offensive, plays
into the worst kind of stereotype ---

MEL
Hey--- stereotype wouldn't be a
stereotype unless it was true.

FBI SHEIK
Yeah? So how would you feel about an
FBI op called JEWSCAM where Ackerman
posed as a greedy, conniving Israeli?

ACKERMAN
(pissed)
My father was Jewish but my mother
was not. WHICH MEANS I AM NOT JEWISH!

MEL
He's right --- technically speaking.
90.

BOYLE
Will you both shut the fuck up!?
(turns to Fbi Sheik)
Look, Sam, I see your point but if
this was a problem, you should've
told us before now ---

FBI SHEIK
You don't have to worry about me,
okay? I'll do the job --- but I just
wanted you to know that I'm not happy
about it ---

MEL
Join the club.

EXT. TARMAC - ATLANTIC CITY AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

Errichetti excitedly watches as the Fbi Sheik and his entourage
of Feds posing as bodyguards and advisors approach. He greets
the FBI Sheik with a retarded bow as if he were a king.

ERRICHETTI
Sheik, my friend. It is such an
superior honor and what have you. On
behalf of all Americans and the great
Garden state of New Jersey, I welcome
you to Atlantic City, my friend.

Slipping into character, the Fbi Sheik puts his hand over his
heart and speaks broken English with a thick Arab accent.

FBI SHEIK
Salam wa aleikum, my friend. Yes.
Yes. Thank you. Please.

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ATLANTIC CITY - A LITTLE LATER

VARIOUS ANGLES of the Sheik's motorcade making its way into the
ghetto shithole that is Atlantic City. An absurd contrast between
the procession's pomp and circumstance and the dire poverty

that surrounds it --- Burned out, boarded up buildings. Vacant
lots. Trash-littered streets. Impoverished residents.

EXT. RESORTS CASINO & HOTEL - ATLANTIC CITY - A LITTLE LATER

The entrance to the hotel has been roped off like a movie
premiere in anticipation of the sheik's arrival. A High School
MARCHING BAND plays "Hail to the Chief." Local newspaper
PHOTOGRAPHERS and TV CREWS. Big-titted SHOWGIRLS dressed as
glittery peacocks...etc...

And at the center of it all, a reception line consisting of
ATLANTIC CITY'S MAYOR, the PRESIDENT OF RESORTS INTERNATIONAL,
other prominent LOCAL POLITICIANS.

The motorcade rolls up. The limo stops in front of the welcome
party, the door is opened and out steps the Sheik followed by
Errichetti.

INT. LIMO - RESORTS CASINO - CONTINUOUS

Boyle exits the limo but Mel holds back a beat.
91.

Reaching into his pocket, Mel pulls out a prescription bottle
of DEXEDRINE amphetamines, pops it open, shakes out five ---
and swallows them dry before getting out of the car.

THE FIRST GROOVY OPENING NOTES of Eddie Fisher singing the
classic "I'm a Born World Shaker" can be heard as we watch Mel
follow the Sheik, Boyle, and Errichetti down the reception line.

INT. PARTY - HOTEL SUITE - RESORTS CASINO - LATER THAT NIGHT

A_ swank, 4,000 square foot suite on the top floor of Resorts
with massive windows that overlook the boardwalk and water.

The place has been fully tricked-out for the occasion and is
packed with a motley assortment of politicians, movers and
shakers, hookers and the biggest players in the casino business.
Everyone either talking shop or rocking out to EDDIE FISHER on
a small stage erected in the back of the room.

ANGLE ON ERRICHETTI AND MEL: Watching the action from the corner.
Errichetti is clearly a little shitfaced.

MEL
This is fantastic, Angie. The party,
the spread --- everything...
ERRICHETTI

(wistfully joyous)
Mel, I'm fifty years old, seen a lotta
things, dreamed a lotta things; but
this is the most un-fuckin-believable
thing I've ever been into my whole
life --- and it just keeps coming up ---
(puts his arm around Mel)
You and me are gonna do beautiful
things together---

MEL
How bout a toast to the guy that
brought us together?

They raise their glasses of champagne together.

ERRICHETTI
Hey-- to Tony Denato. May the poor
bastard rest in peace.

Just then, a scantily clad COCKTAIL WAITRESS struts on by.
Errichetti reaches out and PINCHES her on the ass. She angrily
WHIPS around and confronts Errichetti.

WAITRESS
Did you do that?

ERRICHETTI
Hey, I love you baby. I write you
oems; Roses are red. Violets are
ue. I like spaghetti. Let's fuck.

The shocked and offended waitress storms off, leaving Mel and
Errichetti LAUGHING hysterically.

ANGLE ON: THE BAND ONSTAGE SUDDENLY SHIFTS INTO a tamped-down
royal fanfare and drumroll...
92.

EDDIE FISHER
Ladies and gentlemen... Coming in_all
the way from the Emirates, may I lay
onto you, a_great man and humanitarian ---
I feel humbled in his presence ---
jonignt | s guest of honor, Sheik Kambir
Abdul Rahman!

A portable spotlight swings from the stage to the FBI Sheik and
his procession who enter the party. Everyone CLAPS as the FBI
Sheik moves through the crowd, waving as if he were a rock star.

RAPID FIRE FLASH-CUT MONTAGE OF SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS: grip and
grin snapshots of the FBI Sheik with: TEAMSTER BOSS, N.J.
ASSEMBLYMEN, MAYOR OF UNION CITY, PRESIDENT OF CAESAR'S WORLD,
PENTHOUSE'S BOB GUCCIONE. Each photo is labeled with the names
of the subjects.

DEN - LATER: this small, intimate den is brightly lit compared
to the dim nightclub atmosphere of the party. Although the den
is connected to the main room, it has been roped off.

Errichetti, the FBI Sheik, Mel and Boyle are all seated on
couches. they an are ‘talking to BUCKY ROACH, MANAGER OF THE
TROPICANA IN VEGA:

ROACH
I've been runnin the Tropicana for
ten years so I know whereof I speak ---
and I never lie to my friends. You
bring me and my crew in to run your
new joint at the Shelburne --- we
break bread? You'll never have a
problem. If you're a point holder ---
you're golden...

FBI SHEIK (MONITORS)
Point holder? Yes. Please what does
it mean?

ROACH (MONITORS)
Every casino has one hundred secret
ownership points, each of which
represent a percentage of the skim ---

CAMERA PANS FROM THE SHEIK TOWARDS THE WALL BEHIND MEL AND THEN
ZOOMS IN ON THE WALL...

SURVEILLANCE CLOSET - CONTINUOUS: The utility closet abutting
the den has been converted into a makeshift observation post.
Three monitors observe three different angles: one of the main
room and two others dedicated to the den/meeting room. The tiny
Closet has been heavily soundproofed and as a result, is like a
sweatbox.

Grosswald and the FBI TECHIE watching the meeting on the
MONITORS. They're in t-shirts and shorts --- wearing headphones.

MEL (MONITORS)
If you're the majority point holder
of a joint, your name won't appear
anywhere, but you are an owner ---
93.

ROACH (MONITORS
That's right... And my boys and me,
we got our systems down to a science.
We can clip the drop seven ways from
Sunday « You come to me and say you
need Tiv six hundred thousand taken
off? It'll be there. Cash. Tax free ---

GROSSWALD
(cracks an excited smile)
Fuck, this is great shit ---

PARTY - LATER: In another part of the room, Errichetti
introducing the FBI Sheik to Eddie Fisher.

ERRICHETTI
Sheik, this is a very famous
entertainer. Sold millions of records.
Had his own TV show. Mr. Eddie Fisher.

FISHER
An honor to meet you, sir ---

Mel quickly jumps in to shake Fisher's hand himself.

MEL
Hey Eddie, Mel Weinberg. I just_had
to shake the hand that got to play
with Liz Taylor's pussy.

Everyone except for Fisher starts to LAUGH. Even the Sheik.

RAPID FIRE FLASH-CUT MONTAGE OF SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS: grip and
grin snapshots of FBI Sheik with: A.C. COUNCILMEN, PRESIDENT OF
BALLY'S, MAYOR OF NEWARK, N.J. STATE SENATORS, PLAYBOY'S HUGH
HEFNER.

DEN - LATER: Mel and Errichetti sit with the senior U.S. SENATOR
FROM NEW JERSEY, HARRISON RAND.

MEL (CONT'D)
--- The Sheik's really been looking
forward to this sit down with you
Senator Rand ---

SENATOR RAND
As have I, Mel ---

MEL
He's not gonna say much. He's ashamed
of his English but he understands
everything ---

ERRICHETTI
And it's important you understand
what he wants to hear from you ---

SENATOR RAND
About the Shelburne deal?

SURVEILLANCE CLOSET - CONTINUOUS: Grosswald and FBI Techie
intently watching the meeting on the monitors...
94.

MEL (MONITORS)
No. Don't go into specifics about the
casino. All you have to do is tell
him how powerful you are ---

ERRICHETTI (MONITORS)
In no uncertain terms, Harry ---

MEL (MONITORS)
Fourth ranking Democrat in the Senate
ear of the President, Chairman of
whatever committee, who you know ---
mention names --- what you can do ---

ERRICHETTI (MONITORS)
Come on as strong as possible. You
won't offend him, it's the Arab way ---

DEN - CONTINUOUS:

MEL
Right, without you there is no casino.
Explain to him that because you gotta
stake in the deal you're gonna use
all your power and influence to get
him everything he needs: declaratory
ruling to renovate instead of build,
special tax incentives ---

ERRICHETTI
Whatever he needs. You are the fuckin'
man...

SENATOR RAND
I understand --- not a problem...

Boyle escorts the FBI Sheik into the den and all three men stand--
we can see that Boyle is carrying a BRIEFCASE filled with cash.

ERRICHETTI

Sheik, my friend. I would like to
introduce you to the senior U.S.
Senator from New Jersey -- Harrison
Ri

SENATOR RAND
It's a pleasure to meet you.

FBI SHEIK
(shaking hands with Rand)
Yes. You are welcome.

HIGH ANGLE OVER HOTEL SUITE - PARTY - LATER: We see Mel,
Errichetti, Boyle, the FBI Sheik and Rand emerge from the Den ---
everyone smiling. RAND IS HOLDING THE BRIEFCASE OF CASH.

They all shake hands and Rand leaves. Errichetti walks the Sheik
over to another group of people and begins introductions.

ANGLE CLOSE ON Boyle and Mel as they get a drink at the bar

BOYLE
It shouldn't be this easy.

 
95.

MEL
It isn't that it's that easy, it's
that we're that good ---

Mel and Boyle are suddenly approached by HOWARD CRIDEN. At age
fifty-six, Criden is a swollen seer of a man who wears thick

rimmed glasses with coke-bottle lenses --- and carefully examines
everything he touches: plates, handshakes, doorknobs, everything.
CRIDEN

Good evening, I'm Howard Criden. I
believe you've been expecting me.

(off their blank looks)
I'm Mr. Zelnick's attorney.

Mel and Boyle stiffen up and shake hands with him.

MEL
Is Mr. Zelnick here?

CRIDEN
No. If you could please get the Sheik
there's a helicopter waiting for us
on the roof.

Both Mel and Boyle are shocked by this revelation.

BOYLE
No one ever told us that we were going
to be leaving the premises.

CRIDEN
I'm telling you now.

BOYLE
Well I'm telling you, there's no way
the Sheik's gonna get on a chopper
and fly off for points unknown ---

MEL
Sheik's a paranoid guy. He don't like
surprises and he don't like powerplays ---

CRIDEN
These steps were taken to ensure your
employer's safety, not imperil it.

BOYLE
And we're supposed to just take your
word for that?

CRIDEN
Not my word. Mr. Zelnick's.
(glances at his watch)
vou have twenty minutes before I take
off.

Criden smiles and leaves. Boyle and Mel exchange an extremely
anxious look.
EXT./INT. HELICOPTER - OFF THE COAST OF ATLANTIC CITY - LATER

A helicopter flying over the ocean.

 
96.

Criden, Mel, Boyle, the FBI Sheik and TWO FBI AGENTS POSING AS
BODYGUARDS are seated in the back of the copter. They aze out
the window and the see the dimly lit outline of a LARGE 150FT
YACHT anchored about a mile off the Atlantic City coast.

There's a ring of brig ht lights illuminating a landing pad
situated on the yacht® s stern deck. The men exchange a tense
look as the helicopter begins its descent...

EXT. YACHT - OFF THE COAST OF ATLANTIC CITY - CONTINUOUS

The moment the helicopter touches down and kills its engine the
landing pad lights are turned off. While TWO DECKHANDS quickly
lock down the copter's skids to the pad --- a THIRD HAND opens
the door for the FBI Sheik and his entourage --- and ushers
them toward ARTHUR ZELNICK.

Zelnick's a _power-player whose causal elegance masks the cold
intensity of his bottom-line demeanor. With a practiced
refinement, Zelnick greets the ap pproaching FBI Sheik by touching
the tips of his right fingers to his forehead while bowing the
head slightly. The FBI sheik responds with the same gesture.

ZELNICK
Shake Kambir Abdul Rahman --- Ahlan
wa-sahlan.
FBI SHEIK
Ahlan Beek.
ZELNICK
Esmee Arthur Zelnick. Motasharefon.
FBI SHEIK

Anta lateef.

The two men finally stop shaking hands and Zelnick immediately
places the palm of his right hand over his chest.

ZELNICK

Kaifa haloka?
FBI SHEIK

Al hamdu lillah, bi khair. Wa ant?
ZELNICK

Ana bekhair, shokran.

The FBI Sheik is startled and a little freaked by Zelnick's
fluency. Mel and Boyle are gravely concerned.

FBI SHEIK
You speak Arabic very well Assayed
Zelnick.
Zelnick thanks the Sheik with a nod --- gently takes him by the

arm and ushers him along the starboard deck.
We MOVE WITH Criden, Boyle and Mel as they follow ---

ZELNICK
I understand that you're from the
United Arab Emirates?
97.

FBI SHEIK
Yes.

ZELNICK
Which Emirate?

FBI SHEIK
Why should you ask?

ZELNICK
I'd like to get to know you better ---
especially in lieu of the fact that
none of my contacts at the State
Department have any record of a Shake
Kambir Abdul Rahman from the UAE...

The atmosphere suddenly goes from tense to severe. Boyle and
Mel flash each other an ‘oh fuck' look: is the jig up?

FBI SHEIK
I'm not surprised. The American
intelligence apparatus in my part of
the world is pathetic at best ---

ZELNICK

Well then please enlighten me ---
MEL

The Sheik didn't come here to be

interrogated ---
Zelnick stops and gives Mel a vicious glare.

ZELNICK
Was I talking to you, Mr. Weinberg?
(off Mel's silence)
When I want your opinion, I'll ask
for it ---

The FBI Sheik gives Mel a patronizing, diminutive hand-gesture
to stand down.

FBI SHEIK
I hardly call asking someone where
they're from an interrogation.
turns back to Zelnick)
My blood, the blood of my father's
runs from the Bani Bakhit tribal region
of Ras al-Khaimah ---

ZELNICK
Ras al-Khaimah --- that sits in the
East, yes? Along the Gulf of Oman?

The FBI Sheik stops and glares at Zelnick who stands steadfast.

FBI SHEIK
Laa. It is in the North, and sits
along the Persian Gulf. But then you
know this ---
98.

ZELNICK
Forgive me Shake, I hope you understand
a man in my position cannot be too
careful ---

FBI SHEIK
Yes -- but for the sake of our
discussion things would go much
smoother if you could dispense with
the, how do you say..? Bullshit ---

INT. LIVING ROOM - ZELNICK'S YACHT - A LITTLE LATER

 

A sprawling and elegant living room with windows overlooking
the water. The Sheik, Mel and Boyle sit across a large coffee
table from Zelnick and Criden. The table is covered with a
traditional Arab feast: kabasa, flat breads, fruits, etc...

Mel, the FBI Sheik and Boyle notice that in the far corner of
the room, there is a SHADOW MAN sitting in a chair, watching
from the dark.

ZELNICK

Shake, as I'm sure you are aware, the
casino business is controlled by a
consortium of hidden interests ---

(off Sheik's nod)
Well, I help oversee the organization
which manages this consortium, as
well as almost every other aspect of
our industry. We're the ones that
make sure that nobody cheats or steals.
We keep track of everyone's secret
points. We handle the weekly skim
from each casino and distribute it to
the point holders. We take care of
the credit, set the odds, operate the
cages and the pits, run the unions,
political protection --- everything.
Hal tafham?

FBI SHEIK
Afham.
ZELNICK
Good --- because Atlantic City is the

product of a considerable investment
of time and money by the group I
represent --- and we have no objection
to you profiting from the fruits of
our labor so long as you're willing

to do it our way ---

FBI SHEIK
Please explain ---

ZELNICK
If you want to become a casino owner
and member of our group --- you must
first become a U.S. citizen.

FBI SHEIK
And why must I do this?
99.

CRIDEN
The Gas crisis has created an enormous
amount of anti-Arab sentiment. As
soon as you apply for a license,
they'll legislate against it.

; ZELNICK ;
But, if you're a U.S. citizen, it
gives us the political cover we need.

We suddenly hear the METALLIC SNAP of _a Zippo lighter being
opened and ignited as the Shadow Man lights a cigarette.

BOYLE
(interrupting)
Excuse me...
(gesturing to Shadow Man)
Who's that person?

ZELNICK
Nobody you need to concern yourself

with. |

(back to Sheik)
Mister Criden will handle everything
through our friends in Congress, who
will introduce a private bill providing
you and your family political asylum.

CRIDEN

The process will be no different than

it's been for you in Atlantic City

with the local and state officials.

Do the right thing with the right
the

people, re won't be any problems.
FBI SHEIK
And in exchange for your political
contacts and influence --- what is it
that I must do for you?
ZELNICK

We'd like you to assume twenty one
million in Teamster mortgages on
various resort properties in Atlantic
City, the Poconos and Miami.

FBI SHEIK

I'm confused. I came here to discuss
projects in Atlantic City -- not Miami
or this other place he speaks of.

ZELNICK
Shake, what you need to understand is
that New Jersey is only the beginning
of our plans. Statistics show that
the vast majority of gamblers reside
on the east coast... and so we are in
the process of taking the Atlantic
City model and transplanting it along
the entire Eastern seaboard; the
Poconos. Miami. New Orleans. Savannah.

We're currently ARETE campaigns for

 
100.

ZELNICK (CONT'D)
legalized gambling referendums in six
different states, acquiring all the
political support we need --- tying
up all the best properties in the
areas we're looking to exploit ---

FBI SHEIK
(cutting him off)
This is_all very interesting. But
again, I am here to discuss
opportunities in Atlantic City.

Mel can see that Zelnick is put off by the FBI Sheik's
closemindedness.

ZELNICK
(sternly)
Doing things our way means investing
in our whole vision. Not part of it.

FBI SHEIK
Be that as it may, I would rather
start with Atlantic City and see how
things progress.

ZELNICK
(irritated and suspicious)
Why is it you're so fixated on Atlantic
City when there's so much more money
to be made elsewhere?

Mel flashes the FBI Sheik a glare, trying to signal him to just
play along with Zelnick --- but the FBI Sheik doesn't get it.

FBI SHEIK
Because I only invest in what is. Not
what might be ---

MEL

(cutting in)
Money is like manure, Sheik. If you
spread it around, it can do a lot of
good. Make things grow. But if you
pile it all up in one place and let
it sit there sta panty it won't do
anythin ut sme ike shi

y Ygesturing to sereteky

All Mr. Zelnick here is saying is
that the smart move is to spread it
around --- and I couldn't agree with
him more.

FBI SHEIK
Ah yes, I see. Thank you for that Mel ---
once again your eloquence illuminates
the path of my understanding...

ZELNICK
Shake, I know you are new to this
country and my business. But please
believe me when I tell you that my
(MORE )
101.

ZELNICK (CONT'D)
organization is perhaps the most
trustworthy and dependable operating
in the world today. We always honor
our agreements and we always make

money for our partners --- and you
can be sure that this is true because
if it weren't --- I'd be dead.
_ FBI SHEIK
(nodding)
Ana fahim ---
ZELNICK

Good. Then should you decide to move
forward with us, we cannot formally

engage until your citizenship has

been secured --- but I'd like you to
pledge the twenty-one million in an

escrow account as a sign of good faith ---

FBI SHEIK
And if I don't agree to these terms?

ZELNICK
You can either be at the table, or
you can be on the menu. The choice is
yours.

WE HEAR CLAPPING AND CHEERING AS WE CUT TO:
INT. BASEMENT COMMAND CENTER - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - NEXT DAY

The small group of FEDS making up the ABSCAM team clap and cheer ---
giving Mel, Boyle, and the FBI Sheik pats on the back as they

walk into a large basement which has been converted into the
investigation's off-site Command Center.

 

Beers are passed out as everyone celebrates the success of the
Atlantic City party. A jubilant Grosswald throws his hands around
both Boyle and Mel --- giving them a simultaneous bear hug.

GROSSWALD
Holy shit!!! You guys did it! I mean
you really did it!!!

Boyle and Grosswald start to laugh with excited glee.

ACKERMAN
(raising his beer to toast)
Everyone shut up! I want to say

something

he room quiets down)

From thd very beginning I was convinced
that this whole op was going to be a
goddamn train wreck. Boyle, I thought

you were crazy. And Mel, I knew_you

were nothin ut full of shit. I

remember telling Grosswald that this

was going to be the end of our careers --
102.

a hi GROSSWALD
augnin
He did --- Ke aed,

ACKERMAN
Now here we are, the day after what
has got to be one of the most insane
episodes in FBI history --- but also
one of the most successful. Last night
was a smash hit in every way. And I

just a ---
Jus got Fa Ag up his beer)
You guys made a believer out of me!

Everyone joins in TOASTING and CHEERING Mel, Boyle, and the FBI
Sheik --- but the good vibes are quickly extinguished when...

Tuccio STORMS into the room and angrily SLAMS THE DOOR, glaring
at Mel like he wants to eat him. Unfazed, Mel begins to take a
sip from his beer. Before it reaches his lips Tuccio ANGRILY
SMACKS IT out of his hands.

MEL
The fuck's with you?

TUCCIO
Like you don't know.

MEL
Whaddya talking about?

BOYLE
What's up, Joe?

Tuccio hands Boyle a HIGHLIGHTED transcript.

TUCCIO
It's from last night. Mel's little
pep talk with the Senator. Read the
ighlights.

As Boyle reads, his face contorts into a mixture of rage and
anxiety...

MEL
What the hell is everyone's problem?

BOYLE

(looks up at Mel, explodes)
You! You're the fucking problem! How
many times have we been over the rules
of entrapment?! Chapter and verse---
how many times?! And then you go and
fucking do this? | .

(reading from transcript)
"Explain to him that because you gotta
stake in the deal you re gonna use
all your power and influence to get
him everything he needs"! !??

Boyle angrily HURLS the transcript at Mel.
103.

MEL
What?! I was just trying to make sure
you guys got what you needed.

TUCCIO
You were coaching him, putting words
into his mouth ---

MEL
I didn't force the Senator to take
the money or say what he said!

BOYLE
(picking up transcript
What's the potential impact of this?

TUCCIO
There's nothing potential about it.
The impact is actual, systemic and
toxic. Mel's pep talk not only
undermines the case against Rand, it
cripples virtually every case connected
to this operation because every single
defense attorney will use this
transcript as evidence that Mel did
the same with their clients.

A heavy silence overtakes the room.

BOYLE
It's bad. But it's not fatal. We can
fix this. We just need another_meeting
where we can get a clean, unsolicited
admission from Senator Rand.

TUCCIO
(after a thoughtful beat)
It doesn't solve the problem, but it
might minimize it to an acceptable
evel ---

MEL
And how we Supposed to_get another
meeting when the guy already took?

BOYLE
You fucked this up, Mel. You're going
to figure it out.

TUCCIO
Houseman's office has been calling
all morning. He wants the transcripts.

BOYLE
The Director sees this --- and that's
it! We're over.

TUCCIO

(after a long, hard beat)
Look, Houseman isn't asking for the
warm-up with Rand. He's aski for
the transcript from the actual game ---
hard look at Boyle)
So let's give it to him.
104.

ACKERMAN
Wait a minute. Are you suggesting we
bury Mel's pep talk

TUCCIO
No. I'm suggesting that we show it to
Houseman after we get a clean admission
from the Senator.

ACKERMAN
I don't know if I'm comfortable with
that. You're talking about knowingly
withholding vital information from
the Director of the FBI.

BOYLE
Come on, Al. There's too much at stake
here to let this stop us from serving
the greater good.

 

Ackerman stands there with everyone in the room staring at him
waiting for him to protest --- but he doesn't.

TUCCIO
(looking at everyone)
If anyone else here has a problem,
speak now or forever hold your shit.

No one says anything. After a beat, Mel speaks up.

MEL
What about Zelnick? He's expecting an
answer from the Sheik.

TUCCIO
Reach out tomorrow and let Criden
know the Sheik wants to move forward ---
and get him to start setting meetings
with their politicians ---

MEL
How you gonna do that without puttin'
up the twenty one mil Zelnick's askin'
or?

TUCCIO
Cause we're gonna stall him for as
long as we can --- and see how deep
we can get before he calls our bluff.

EXT. LEXINGTON AVE. - MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - EARLY EVENING

Mel cuts across early morning traffic on Lex Ave. He's carrying
another one of those pink BAKERY BOX'S from Moishe's. We see
him enter a low rent, run-down office building.

INT. SEVENTH FLOOR - LEX AVE. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
Mel exits the elevator and we MOVE WITH HIM as he walks down

the hallway. He reaches a nondescript office door and we FOLLOW
HIM as he enters.
105.

INT. OFFICE - SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Mel enters a small, cluttered temporary office. Reclining behind
a desk in the middle of the room sits Max. She's on the phone,
but gives Mel a huge smile when she sees him.

Mel catches a few fleeting glimpses of the walls which are
covered with an array of info --- as he comes over to the desk
puts the bakery box in front of Max and gives her a quick but
sensuous kiss on the lips.

MAX (INTO PHONE)
Yeah, Teddy, do what you have to do,
but just make sure the trucks are

there on time ---

As Maxine wraps up her call, Mel reaches into his pocket and
takes out his bottle of DEXEDRINE, pops out a couple of pills,
swallows. Max hangs up and rises to embrace and kiss Mel.

MAX (CONT'D)
Thanks for the rugelach --- but you
really shouldn't be here.

The phone starts ringing again.

MEL
Need to answer that? ---

MAX
I'll let the service get it. How did
everything go?

MEL
So far so good. How's everything goin'
with you?

MAX
It'd be going a lot better if I had a
hard date.

MEL

I'm workin' on it, pussycat. I'm
workin' on it.

Max reaches into Mel's pocket and pulls out the bottle of
Dexedrine and holds it up.

MAX
Since when did you start using speed?

MEL
You know how many plates I'm spinnin
right now. I let any of them drop an
we're fucked to forevermore.

MAX
You need to take better care of
yourself. I mean you look really strung
out.
106.

MEL
Hey, strung out comes with the
territory.
(gives her a tender grin)
But it's nice to know you give a shit.

EXT. VESCO TOWNHOUSE - MANHATTAN - DAY

Late afternoon sunlight washing over the elegant townhouse.

BOYLE V.O.
Uh, you ready --- are we taping?

ACKERMAN (OVER WALKIE-TALKIE)
Yeah, wait, okay --- go ahead Jimmy...

INT. STUDY - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Boyle sits behind a desk situated in an elegant mahogany paneled
study. In front of him are ten packets of cash. Looking directly
into a hidden camera, Boyle speaks stiffly, self consciously.

BOYLE

(clears his throat)
This is Special Agent James Boyle.
Federal Bureau of Investigation. The
date is August 19th, 1979. Time,

(and ca ing oO Gash)
I have in front of me fifty thousand
dollars in five packets of one hundred
dollar bills. .

(puts cash in desk drawer)
I am now placing the money in this
drawer where it will remain until it
is given to Representative Meyers.

ACKERMAN (OVER WALKIE-TALKIE)
Okay --- we got it ---

MEL (0.S.)
You sound like the spawn of
Frankenstein and fuckin' Howard Cosell.
Loosen up, will ya?

We hear a big brassy, bombastic orchestra begin to play Franz
Von Suppe's "Bellman March" --- as the...

THE BULLSHIT MONTAGE BEGINS: Music playing over montage.

CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER: We can see the TABLE OF CONTENTS of a top-
secret FBI memo being typed out... The memo is entitled:

for what you"re giving --- I control

the whole bloc of Congressman from
Philly and will make sure they all
back an asylum bill for the Sheik.
With me in his corner, his chances
are a 100% ---

BOYLE
I'm really glad to hear that
Congressman, because this is a lot of
money ---

Boyle takes out the fifty thousand in packets of cash and hands
them to Meyers with an envelope.

MYERS
You're going about this the right
way... Money talks and bullshit walks
and it's the same way down in D.C.

BOYLE
(nods, smiles)
Spend it well.

Myers tries to stuff the cash into the envelope. It won't fit.

MYERS
I'm gonna need a bigger envelope.

CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER: The table of contents of the top-secret
memo continues to be typed out. We see a list of names --- U.S.
Congressman Michael"Ozzie Meyers, 1st District, (D-PA.) ---
U.S. Congressman Raymond Lederer, 3rd District (D-PA.) ---

SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM TOWNHOUSE: Timecode: September 7, 1979.

This is Richard Kelly. Representative
from the 5th District in Florida ---

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL BASEMENT COMMAND CENTER: Tuccio,
Ackerman, Boyle sitting around a table in the command center
watching the Kelly video over beers and burgers.

We can see Mel in the background, talking on the phone. After
hanging up, Mel pops a few Dexedrine and then approaches.

; TUCCIO
So what did Angie say?

MEL
He just having trouble understanding
why we need another meeting with Rand.

TUCCIO
Well then give him some of your
bullshit and make him understand!
108.

MEL
(savagely barking back)
Hey, I'm dancin’ as fast I can
mot erfucker --- but Errichetti said
he won't do shit unless we make good
on our word and deposit that two mil
in his friend's bank.

BOYLE
So if Houseman green-lights this and
we make the deposit --- Angie will
set up the meet?

MEL

Yeah. No question.

BOYLE
(off Tuccio's reticence)
There's zero risk for us, Joe ---
it's our account. Money's just gonna
be sitting there, earning interest.

TUCCIO
I'll ask, but it's Houseman's call.
CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER: The name currently being typed out --- U.S.

Congressman John Wilson Jenrette, Jr., 6th District (D-S.C.)

INT. BASEMENT COMMAND CENTER - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - DAY: Tuccio,
Ackerman and Grosswald are crowded around the TV MONITORS
watching the meeting between Boyle, Mel, Criden and U.S.
CONGRESSMAN JOHN W. JENRETTE JR. Timecode: “November 11, 1979.”

CONGRESSMAN JENRETTE
-If you invest in my district it
will give me the cover I need with my

people --- explains why I'm helping
Sheik Kaboom or Sheik Kabaam ---
BOYLE

So you'd rather us commit to invest
in your district than take the cash?

CONGRESSMAN JENRETTE
You kidding? I got larceny in my blood.

Tuccio and the rest are all shocked and disgusted as they watch
Jenrette scoop the packets of cash off the desk and stuff them
in his jacket and pant pockets.

SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM TOWNHOUSE: Timecode: November 20th

INT - HOTEL SUITE - JFK AIRPORT HILTON - DAY: Boyle, het and
Criden sit in the living room of the suite. Boyle's on the phone.
109.

CRIDEN (CONT'D)
It's already the end of November ---
Zelnick wants to know when he can
expect the money from the Sheik ---

Mel doesn't answer. He looks to Boyle.

BOYLE
Uh, soon --- very soon ---

CRIDEN
Jimmy, we've been following through
on our end. He wants a hard date ---

BOYLE
How about the end of December --- the
latest.
CRIDEN
Why don't we just say, December 29th.
MEL
Why the 29th?
CRIDEN

It's Zelnick's birthday.

Boyle gives Criden a nod. We can see the high impact of this
hard date agreement on Mel's face.

There's a knock at the door. Mel gets up, answers it and ushers
CONGRESSMAN JOHN MURPHY into the suite.

As Mel and Congressman Murphy shake hands in the background, we
see Criden take out a list of typed names and hand it to Boyle.

CRIDEN (CONT'D)
Here's what I'm trying to line up
over the next month.

Putting the list in his pocket, Boyle and Criden rise to greet
the Congressman as he approaches.

INT. BASEMENT COMMAND CENTER - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - DAY:
Mel, Boyle, Tuccio, Ackerman and Grosswald.

BOYLE
(reads from Criden's list)
John Murtha, Co-chair of the House
Ethics Committee. Pete Rodino, Chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee.
Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neil ---

GROSSWALD
Tip O'Neil?!

BOYLE
Yup. But I saved the best for last.
(beat) The President's Chief of Staff
Hamilton Jordan...

TUCCIO
Get the fuck out!
(MORE )
110.

TUCCIO (CONT'D)
(takes list and reads)
How deep does this thing go?

MEL
Greed's a bottomless pit. Always has
been.

Boyle, Tuccio and Grosswald are definitely thunderstruck ---
but the expression on Ackerman's face is one of abject fear

CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER: The TABLE OF CONTENTS of the Memo being
completed --- The Memo being SEALED into a TOP-SECRET FOLDER ---

INT - DIRECTOR HOUSEMAN'S OFFICE - FBI HQ - WASHINGTON: FBI
Director Houseman sits behind his desk, reading from the open
ABSCAM SPECIAL REPORT. He has a profoundly disturbed look on
his face as he reads the list of potential new targets.

HOUSEMAN
(muttering, horrified)
Jesus Christ.

Houseman pulls out a cigarette and lights it, takes a deep and
anxious drag. Cringing with fear and dismay as if he'd just
been punched in the face by some unseen hand, Houseman gazes
out his window at the illuminated dome of the Capitol Building.

END MUSIC AND BULLSHIT MONTAGE.

CUT TO:
EXT. BOARDWALK - ATLANTIC CITY - MORNING
SUPER: "December 27, 1979 - Atlantic City"

An epic shot of the morning sun rasing over the ramshackle
majesty of the Atlantic City boardwal

EXT./INT. LIMO - STREET - ATLANTIC CITY - CONTINUOUS

Grosswald's behind the wheel --- looking at the addresses on
buildings as he passes them. Boyle and Mel are in the backseat.

MEL
(to Boyle)
Zelnick's having Criden call me every
day now ---

 

 

GROSSWALD
(hollers back at Mel)
The bank's address --- ?

MEL
(looks at a piece of paper
Fifty-six twenty-four --- Supposed to
be on a corner.

EXT. BOARDWALK BANK - ATLANTIC CITY - A LITTLE LATER

Situated on the corner of St. James and Broadway, the Boardwalk
Bank is just your average local bank. We see the limo pull up
to_the front of the bank. Mel and Boyle exit the car. Boyle has
a large suitcase handcuffed to his wrist.
141.

MEL
...I don't know what to tell him any
more --- I got no stalls left to give

these guys. And even if I did, they
ain't hearin' em ---

BOYLE
Who are we meeting with?

MEL
(looking at paper)
Marvin Donaldson, bank's President.

BOYLE
And he knows we're coming?
MEL
Yeah, yeah, Angie set it all up ---
WE MOVE WITH BOYLE AND MEL as they enter...
INT. BOARDWALK BANK - ATLANTIC CITY - CONTINUOUS

The inside of the bank is just as bland as the outside. Phones
are ringing. Customers lined up at the teller windows. Your
ne

typical We sday morning. Mel and Boyle speak in hushed tones.
BOYLE
I get that Zelnick's on a short fuse ---
MEL

Short fuse? That was yesterday. Today
they're ready to blow ---

Boyle looks over to an ACCOUNT MANAGER at his desk.

BOYLE
Where's Marvin Donaldson's office?

The account manager points to a back corner office and we
continue to MOVE WITH MEL AND BOYLE as they make their way
towards Donaldson's office. A SECRETARY sits at her desk next
to the door.

MEL
Zelnick's deadline is only a few days
away. You gotta bring down the curtain
on this show!

BOYLE
And we will.

MEL
When?

BOYLE

(to secretary
Please tell Mr. Donaldson that James
Hoyle and Mel Weinberg from Abdul
Enterprises are here to see him.

SECRETARY
Of course. Just one moment.
112.

She disappears into the office.

MEL
When, Boyle?

BOYLE
As soon as we get our meeting with
Rand, we're done. It's over. Tooch
wild move on the indictments the next
ay.

The Secretary comes back out, followed by MARVIN DONALDSON: a
fat, bald, forty-something man in a Brooks Brothers suit.
Donaldson greets them both with a hearty smile and handshake.

DONALDSON
Gentlemen, Marvin Donaldson. A real
pleasure to meet you both.
(ushering them inside)
Please come in.

INT. DONALDSON'S OFFICE - BOARDWALK BANK - A LITTLE LATER

Donaldson's secretary sits at_a conference table, watching as
the last packet of hundred dollar bills is processed through a
CASH COUNTING MACHINE. The two million in cash sits next to the
machine in a neat stack.

Behind her, we see Donaldson at his desk with Boyle, walking
him through a series of SIGNATURES.

DONALDSON
James, if I could just have three
more signatures --- right here, here,
and here --- and date the last one ---

Boyle signs the last documents. The Secretary nods at Donaldson
affirming that all the money is there.

DONALDSON (CONT'D)
Please take it to the vault.

As the Secretary leaves the office with the money, Donaldson
gathers up all the documents.

DONALDSON (CONT'D)
I'm just going to make copies of these.
I'll be right back.

Donaldson quickly exits the office.

MEL
Jimmy, I vouched for you guys. I went
on record with Dom who went on record
with Lansky. Now you know what that
means. If we don't end this before
the 29th, I'm a dead man on the street.

BOYLE
(locks eyes with Mel)
Mel, mark my words: I'm not going to
let anything happen to you or your
family.
113.

MEL
Mark ‘em yourself --- cause the only
thing that'll protect me is if arrests

are made and indictments handed down.
Donaldson returns to the office and hands the documents over

DONALDSON
Here are your copies of the account
documentation --- Your receipt for.
your deposit --- Temporary checks if
you wish to draw on the account ---

_ BOYLE / /

We're not going to be drawing on this
account.

DONALDSON

Well, in any case, you'll be receiving
a checkbook by the end of next week.

BOYLE
So that's it?

DONALDSON
(broad smile)
That's it. I'd like to thank you both
and the Sheik, for doing business
with us here at Boardwalk Bank. And
as a token of our appreciation, I'd
like to present you with this gift.

Donaldson hands Boyle a box. Boyle opens it and sees a cheap
gold-plated PEN and a MECHANICAL PENCIL with the bank's name
engraved on the side of them. Mel LAUGHS.

MEL
We just deposited two mil in cash and
this is what we get?

BOYLE
I'd rather have the toaster

Boyle gives the pen set back to Donaldson.
EXT. BOARDWALK BANK - ATLANTIC CITY - MINUTE LATER
They exit the bank and walk towards the limo.

BOYLE

So when are you going to tell Estelle?
MEL

I dunno. I gotta find the right moment.
BOYLE

Along with the bad, you've done some
good Mel. When this breaks it's going
to change things for the better. And
you can be proud of that.

MEL
Proud of what? Whaddya think it is
we've done, Boyle?
114.

BOYLE
We've rooted out organized crime and
political corruption at the highest
evels ---

MEL
(shaking his head)
We've been shoveling smoke ---
nothing's gonna change. Not really.

BOYLE
How can you say that?

MEL
Not believing in bullshit is like not
believing in gravity --- it's part of
who we are in this country --- and
it'll always be there --- cause

Americans, they don't want the bad
truth. They want the good lie.

EXT. ALIBI CLUB - WASHINGTON, DC - LATE AFTERNOON

A light snow falls over a townhouse that is home to the most
exclusive and oldest social club for Washington's power elite.
Behind the townhouse looms the illuminated dome of the Capitol
uilding.

 

We see a CAB pull up in front of the club and Tuccio gets out
and enters the club.

INT. LIBRARY - ALIBI CLUB - WASHINGTON, DC - CONTINUOUS

We follow Tuccio into a large and handsome panelled library.
Small groups of men have quiet conversations throughout.

Stopping for a beat to look around, Tuccio sees FBI Director
Houseman in the far corner of the room seated in front of a
crackling fireplace. Someone is sitting in the chair opposite
the Director, but Tuccio can't see who it is.

Houseman waves Tuccio over and we move with him as he approaches.

HOUSEMAN
Joseph. I appreciate you coming on
such short notice. But I'm afraid
this face to face simply couldn't
wait.

TUCCIO
Of course sir -- What's the problem?

Houseman pulls out a transcript and holds it out to Tuccio.

HOUSEMAN
Mr. Weinberg's pep-talk with Senator
Rand ----

This revelation drops on Tuccio like a fucking bomb.

HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
I know you had your reasons for
withholding this MORE) me --- but now
115.

HOUSEMAN (CONT'D)
that I've been made aware, I've got
to do something about it.

TUCCIO
How'd you get it?

ACKERMAN (0.S.)
I gave it to him, Joe.

We PAN WITH TUCCIO as he whips around and is shocked to discover
that the person seated across from Houseman is Agent Alvin
Ackerman.

Rage welling up in Tuccio like lava...

HOUSEMAN
Don't hold it against him. Agent
Ackerman was simply responding to the
unfortunate circumstances created by
an out of control informant, an over-
ambitious U.S. attorney and an
inexperienced supervising agent.

INT. MEL'S BEDROOM - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT

 

Mel's lying on the bed, watching television --- a segment on
the Presidential campaign trail and the run-up to the election
dovetails into a segment about President Carter attending new
years eve fund raiser celebration in New York.

He glances at his watch: 1:30 AM. Turning off the TV, Mel gets
out of bed and pops a few Dexedrine. He then opens the door,
and peers out into the hallway.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

WE MOVE WITH MEL as he slips through the darkened hallway ---
approaching the upstairs den where he hears a group of men
KIBITZING and LAUGHING.

Stealing a peek into the room, Mel can see that Boyle, Grosswald
and three other agents are having a late-night poker game. Mel
tiptoes past them without anyone noticing and disappears down
the back stairs to the kitchen.

INT. BASEMENT COMMAND CENTER - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - A MINUTE LATER

Closing the basement door behind him, Mel creeps down the Steps
moves to a huge steel shelf in the back of the room lined wit
rows and rows of labeled and dated videotapes. He scans the
tapes until he finds the one he' § booking for --- "CONGRESSMAN
MYERS -- August 19, 1979" --- pulls it ---

Moving to two half-inch video recorders connected to each other
Mel puts the labeled tape into one machine, a blank tape into
the other, and begins DUPING the Myers tape.

Mel then cuts across the room to a portable refrigerator, reaches
around to its back, and unhooks a hidden key ring. He uses one
of the keys to open up a locked filing cabinet.

 
116.

Mel rifles through the files until he finds the one he's looking
for --- "OPERATION ABSCAM: SPECIAL REPORT TO THE UNITED STATES
ATTORNEY GENERAL..."

INT. SECOND FLOOR DEN - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Your typical ballbreaking banter and bullshit. Tuccio suddenly
APPEARS at the door, looking fucked up and far from home.

TUCCIO
(to Boyle)
I need to talk to you.

INT. BASEMENT COMMAND CENTER - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Mel is XEROXING off the report when he hears the muffled sound
of men ARGUING in the townhouse's study right above him.

Curious, Mel stops Xeroxing, moves to the video monitors, flips
them on and sees the crude, hidden camera images of Boyle and
Tuccio having it out in the study. Mel puts on the headphones.

BOYLE

How could Ackerman do this to us!?
TUCCIO

He pussied out --- couldn't handle

it. So he decided to save himself.

BOYLE (ON MONITOR)
So that's it? Houseman won't even
approve another meeting with Senator
Rand?

TUCCIO (ON MONITOR)
You're not hearing me, Jimmy.
Houseman's going to pull the plug on
the whole thing -- and he's positioning
us to take the fall.

BOYLE (ON MONITOR)
And so Errichetti, casino
commissioners, six Congressmen, the
fuckin' Senator --- Zelnick and Lansky?

. TUCCIO (ON MONITOR)
They're going to dump it all.

INT. STUDY - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Boyle rubs his head and paces, trying to get a grip on it all.

BOYLE
And this is all because of what? ---
Mel's pep-talk with Rand?

TUCCIO
It's not just that. Everything about
this operation scares Houseman ---

BOYLE
Oh, but he's not scared about the
fact that Atlantic City's corrupt to
(MORE )
117.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
the core --- or alarmed that U.S.
Congressmen and Senators can be so
easily bought off?! He's not shitting
his pants over how many politicians
Zelnick and Lansky might have locked
up in their pocket and why?

TUCCIO
He's playing politics Jimmy. It's an
election year ---

BOYLE
(thundering)
Bullshit! This has nothing to do with
politics and everything to do with
the worst kind of cowardice ---
cowardice in the face of absolute
guilt.

Tuccio stands there in devastated silence.

BOYLE (CONT'D)
What about Mel? Without the arrests
and indictments he's out there naked
on the street.

TUCCIO
As far as Houseman's concerned, Mel's
a fucking Dixie Cup, a throwaway.

BOYLE
We can't just leave him out there.

/ TUCCIO
pimmy we're going to have enough
trouble covering our own asses.

BOYLE
(after a long beat
I don't know if I can swallow it.

TUCCIO
You've got no other choice.
; BOYLE
I_can pick up a whistle and start to
blow --- To the Times, the Post ---
TUCCIO

Houseman will crucify you and he'll
force me to help him.

BOYLE
Then fuck him and fuck you.
TUCCIO
Jimmy --- you of all people know if

there's one thing the Bureau's good
at, I mean really good at, it's
character assassination.
118.

Moving to one of the armchairs in front of the massive Mahogany
partner's desk, Boyle grabs the top of the chair and leans down
as if he's overwhelmed with nausea.

TUCCIO (CONT'D)
It'd be like running into a machine
gun.

We see and HEAR Boyle's GRIP TIGHTEN INTENSELY ON THE WOOD. And
then in a sudden and visceral EXPLOSION OF TOWERING FRUSTRATION
AND RAGE, he swings the chair above his head and begins SMASHING
IT against the partners desk

INT. BASEMENT COMMAND CENTER - VESCO TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mel is mesmerized by the si ht of Boyle wielding the chair like
a battlehammer --- using at of his strength to try to DESTROY
the desk, but the only thing he ends up destroying is the chair.

Mel TURNS THE TV OFF...
EXT. MEL'S STREET - LONG ISLAND - DAY

 

Mel pulls into the driveway of his house, gets out of his car
carrying a briefcase.

SUPER: "December 29, 1979"
INT. LIVING ROOM - MEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mel walks in and finds Willie on the floor playing video games.

MEL
How you doing boychick?
WILLIE
(preoccupied with videogame)
Hey Pop.
MEL
Where's Mom?
WILLIE

I think she's in the bedroom.

INT. OFFICE - MEL'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Mel places his briefcase on his desk, removes the duped tapes
and the copy of "OPERATION ABSCAM: SPECIAL REPORT."

He then unlocks a filing cabinet and pulls out a LARGE PARCEL
BANKER'S BOX. Inside the box are even more duped videotapes,
audiotapes, and documents that Mel has apparently accumulated
over the course of the investigation.

Mel puts the videotapes into the box and then places the SPECIAL
REPORT on top of everything, as if it's to be read first.

Grabbing some packaging tape out of his desk, he seals the box,
then appiics a ADDRESS STICKER to it. Typed on that sticker:
"CONFIDENTIAL; LESLIE MAITLAND, NEW YORK TIMES...

Before leaving his office, Mel shakes out a HANDFUL OF DEXEDRINE
and washes them down with a swig of whiskey.
119.

INT. BEDROOM - MEL'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
Estelle's on the bed, reading People Magazine. Mel walks in.

MEL

Hey --
ESTELLE

I didn't know you were here---
ME

Yeah, I'm in and out. I just came
home to change for an important

meeting... But I'll be back in a few
hours...

ESTELLE
Okay.

ME

Any chance you an 1 I could go out to
dinner tonight, alone?

Estelle can see the tension in Mel's face.

ESTELLE
What's wrong?

 

MEL
Nothing. I just wanna talk. Get some
things off my chest.

ESTELLE
I'll see if I can get the sitter

EXT. MEL'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Mel comes out dressed in his best suit and coat. He has the
ABSCAM BANKER'S BOX in his arms. He locks the box in the trunk
of his car and walks towards the driver's side door...

A silver Cadillac Deville suddenly pulls up in front of his
driveway and stops.

Sonny Blitz is the first to get out of the car. He throws Mel a
vicious smile as Dominic Casele emerges from the Caddie along
with two of his Bonebreakers.

MEL
Hey--- Dom --- Whaddya doing here?

EXT. MEL'S STREET - CONTINUOUS

FROM DOWN THE STREET we see Mel get into the back seat of the
DeVille, Bonebreakers on either side of him. The car peels away
from the curb and disappears around a corner.

EXT. ALLIED AMUSEMENTS - OUTSKIRTS OF ATLANTIC CITY - LATER

The same dark and dingy street of industrial warehouses we began
the film with.
120.

MEL (V.0.)
Whaddya want?!

SCARFO (V.0.)
Whaddya think I want? The truth.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS ON the Allied Amusement's warehouse ---
as we pick up the scene where we last left it...

MEL (V.0.)
The truth? (Beat) The truth... The
truth is bullshit!!

INT. RUMPUS ROOM - ALLIED AMUSEMENTS - CONTINUOUS
Scarfo's SAVAGE SKULL PUNCH sends Mel hurling to the floor.

SCARFO
The truth's bullshit? You're bullshit!
(STOMPS Mel in the guts)
Commitments were made based on the
deal with the Arab. Financial
commitments --- that the man in Florida
is now on the hook for.

Scarfo takes out a GUN, crouches down to Mel, and puts the muzzle
on his left KNEE ---

SCARFO (CONT'D)
What kind of game is the sheik playing,
Mel? Why didn't he get the money up?

MEL
Because there is no sheik ---
Without missing a beat, Scarfo PULLS THE TRIGGER --- AND BOOOOM ---
BLOWS MEL'S KNEE TO SHIT --- Mel SHRIEKS --- the mind-numbing
agony overloads his circuits and he begins to go into shock.
SCARFO

I don't want him tapping out.

Two Goons peel Mel off the floor, sit him in the chair and hold
him up. The third Goon takes out a glass pellet of smellin
salts, snaps it open and waves it under Mel's nose. Mel takes
one whiff and RECOILS back into consciousness.

SCARFO (CONT'D)

It's gonna be like this all night ---
piece by piece. Until you gimme a
straight answer.

Scarfo puts the muzzle of his gun to Mel's other kneecap.

SCARFO (CONT'D)
The truth, Mel.

Mel HYPERVENTILATING his way through the pain...

MEL
I'm tryin' to tell you. The sheik ---
everyone surrounding him --- they're

all Feebs.
121.

SCARFO
(pulls gun hammer back)
Keep fucking with me ---

MEL
I swear on the soul of my son, the
whole thing's an FBI sting operation.

SCARFO
I don't believe it. No way the Feebs
coulda pulled something like this
off.

MEL
No, not unless they had someone show
them how ---

SCARFO

You crazy rat motherfucker.

(puts gun to Mel's mouth)
You shoulda walked away when Dom gave
you the chance.

MEL

You're right ---

(tears welling up)
But the Feds have @ got nothing on
Zelnick or any is key people,
except for arden and the politicians ---
and they ain't gonna move against
them either.

SCARFO
You're full of shit, Weinberg. That
don't even make any sense.

MEL
It's politics. Sense don't enter into
the equation.

Mel leans forward as if he were about to throw up ---

SHADOW MAN (0.S.)
(gruff Yiddish accent)
How do I know you're telling us the
truth?

MEL
(cackles)
That's all I got left ---

The Shadow Man suddenly emerges from the darkness. We can only
see him from behind as he walks up to Mel and examines his face.

SHADOW MAN
Know what, Mel? I believe you.

Mel starts to LAUGH deliriously. Feverish with pain from his
knee and arm, he suddenly seizes up and grabs his LEFT CHEST as
if he were just stabbed there with an icepick -- and then
COLLAPSES TO THE FLOOR -- overwhelmed by the onset of a massive
HEART ATTACK.
122.

SCARFO
The fuck is this..?

GOON
Look's like he's having a heart attack.

SCARFO
You gotta be shittin me.

MEL'S POV: Looking at the Shadow Man's shoes...

SCARFO (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Whaddya wanna do?

SHADOW MAN (0.S.)
Take care of him.

Darkness overtakes Mel's vision as we...
FADE TO BLACK:
CLOSE ON BLACK TELEVISTON SCREEN:

The TV is SWITCHED ON. A stupid 70's commercial plays, before
the channel is switched to the CBS Evening News. DAN RATHER
BREAKS THE ABSCAM STORY ---

CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - ATLANTIC CITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Seated in the room are Boyle, Estelle and Willie. Boyle's jacket
is off and the FBI BADGE clipped to his belt is in plain view.
Although they're all watching the TV, the tension between Estelle
and Boyle is so extreme you can cut it with your finger

A DOCTOR suddenly appears. Everyone gets up.

DOCTOR
Agent Boyle --- He'd like to speak
with you first.

Boyle follows Doctor to an ICU ROOM being guarded by two COPS.

INT. ICU ROOM - ATLANTIC CITY HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Boyle finds Mel in bed, his leg in a cast, elevated by a sling.
His wrist is bandaged. There's a gruesome STITCH WOUND running
vertically through the center of his chest from open heart
surgery. He's hooked up to all manner of monitoring machines.

MEL
What happened? These stiffs won't
tell me anything.

BOYLE
You were dumped at Emergency in
critical condition. They had to crack
you open --- do a bypass.

MEL
How long I been out?
123.

BOYLE
Been touch and go for the last five
days. .
(moving close to the bed)
Mel, who tuned you up?

MEL
I tuned myself up ---
BOYLE
That's not good enough.
MEL

(hard look)
It's all your ever going to get.

BOYLE
(after a heavy beat)
This was all my fault... I broke my

promise --- I'm sorry ---

MEL
I know --- and I'll get over it as
long as my family is okay ---

BOYLE
Everyone's fine. Estelle and Willie
are right outside... Maxine wanted to
come, but...

MEL
What does Estelle know?

BOYLE
That I'm an FBI agent --- that you

were working for us, not some Sheik ---
and now that the story's leaked to
the press, she knows why ---

MEL
Somebody leaked the story --- ?

BOYLE
Yeah it's all over the news. CBS even
got videos of the some of the payoffs.
Washington's going batshit --- like
it was fucking Watergate --- they all
think you did it.

MEL
Yeah, well they're only half wrong. I
was gonna do it but got picked up
before I could finish the job ---
(with a raised eyebrow)
Had to of been someone else ---

BOYLE
(blowing off Mel's look)
Well in any case it all worked out.
Arrests have been made, indictments
are in the works, grand juries should
be convening in a couple of weeks.
124.

Mel grins, closes his eyes with relief.

MEL
Blowing the whistle took a lot of
left tit Jimmy --
(opens his eyes and locks
with Boyle's)
I'm proud of you ---

BOYLE
What makes you so sure I'm the one
that did it?

MEL
Cause you're the only bog-trotting,
shanty asswipe I know that's noble
enough to run into a machine gun.

Boyle's smile is his silent admission --- which Mel acknowledges
with a grateful nod. After the shared moment...

BOYLE
You ready for Estelle and Willie?

MEL
The fuck am I going to tell them?

BOYLE
That's the good thing about the truth
Mel. You don't have to think about
it. It just is.

The expression on Mel's face goes fragile with fear.

MEL
I don't want to lose them, Jimmy.

BOYLE
If you don't do this, you will.

Mel shuts his eyes in dread and nods. Boyle disappears. A few
seconds later, Estelle and Willie come into the room. Estelle
is overwhelmed by a storm of conflicting emotion ---

Willie sees the state his father is in and starts to cry. Mel
reaches out for him, takes his hand, pulls him in close and
tenderly consoles him.

MEL
It's okay boychick, I'm okay. But I
gotta tell you something ---

h WILLIE
What?

Mel gently lifts up Willie's chin to look him in the eye.

MEL
This is the hardest thing I've ever
had to say cause it's gonna be the
hardest thing you've ever had to hear ---
but you need to know that I -- me --
your father ---

(MORE )
125.

MEL (CONT'D)
(deep breath)

All that I have, all that I know, I
stole. (Beat) If I saw you holding a
cigarette a certain way, and I ed
it, I'd steal it. I'm nota
businessman, never have been. I'ma
bullshit artist, a hustler, a thief ---
and that's the truth of me. It's all
a lie, my whole life --- everything ---
Except 1h hokey willie.

There's (oching truer in this world
than my love for you. You're the only
honest thing I've ever done.

Mel breaks down and starts to CRY. Willie hugs his father. Mel
looks over at Estelle --- they exchange a soulful, heartbreaking
glance before she leaves the room.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - MANHATTAN - LATE AFTERNOON

 

It's a cold and windy day in New York
SUPER: "Three Months Later"

INT. TUCCIO'S OFFICE - JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

 

The floor of Tuccio's office is awash in a ocean of stacks of
files --- the walls are covered by charts, time-lines, etc. --
everything pertaining to the upcoming ABSCAM trials.

Boyle, Tuccio and Mel are seated around a small table covered
with transcripts. Although not fully recovered, Mel looks well
on his way -- in a wheel chair, leg still in a cast.

TUCCIO
Look Mel, the defense is going to try
to nail us on this, so when they ask
you if Boyle specifically authorized
you to make the approach on Tony Denato
at Stella's --- you need to answer in
the affirmative.

MEL
(chuckling)
In the affirmative... So you want me
to bullshit.

TUCCIO
No. We don't lie. We never lie. We
just put our own interpretation on
the truth.

MEL
I like that, that's good. I shoulda
used that line with Estelle.

BOYLE
How's she doing?
126.

MEL
Okay --- Considering --- I dunno, I
think somehow everything finally’ coming

out, it freed her up.

TUCCIO
And youre sure she's going to wait
until after the trials to serve you
with the divorce papers?

MEL
Yeah--- I gave her everything anyway.

Suddenly, the door to the office BURSTS OPEN and in storms FBI
Director Houseman looking like a man out for blood. Boyle and
Tuccio are surprised and disturbed to see him in this state.

Houseman's holding a FILE in his hand --- focusing all of his
barely controlled fury on Mel. Tuccio opens his mouth to say
i

something, but is immediately silenced by Houseman's stone cold,
"shut the fuck up" glare.
HOUSEMAN
Where's the money, Mel?
MEL
Money?
(he looks around the table)
What money?
HOUSEMAN
The two million.
MEL
Two million?
HOUSEMAN
The two million dollars that I
authorized --- that you were supposed
to have deposited in ythe Boardwalk
Bank --- where is it?

MEL
Whaddya mean where is it? It's ina
bank account ---

HOUSEMAN
No, Mel, I don't think so ---

BOYLE

(interrupting)
Sir, excuse me, but I personally
deposited the money in the bank.

HOUSEMAN
WHAT BANK! THERE IS NO FUCKING BANK!!!

Boyle and Tuccio are freaked and totally confused.

BOYLE
I don't understand ---

 

Houseman angrily throws a paper-clipped stack of PHOTOS at Boyle.
127.

HOUSEMAN
Those were taken early this morning
when agents from the Atlantic City
office went to close the Abscam
account.

ANGLE CLOSE ON A SERIES OF PHOTOS as Tuccio and Boyle flip
through them. The snapshots reveal that where there was once

the Boardwalk Bank, there is now just an EMPTY, UNOCCUPIED SHELL
OF A BUILDING.

Boyle and Tuccio are mortified and speechless.

BOYLE
Did you do this?

HOUSEMAN
Of course he did! That's who he is!
That's what he does!

MEL

Look, I wanna be very clear right
now. I have absolutely no idea what
you're talking about.

(raised eyebrow)
But let's just say for argument's
sake --- hypothetically speaking ---
that I did take your fuckin' money.
(Beat) Whaddya you gonna do about it?

HOUSEMAN
I'm going to prosecute you to the
fullest extent of the law!

MEL
You're onty a few weeks out from the
start of the trials. Seven Congressmen.
One Senator. Biggest case in FBI
history --- and you wanna go after
your linchpin witness? Hey, I'm not a
awyer but wouldn't doing that play
right into the defense's strategy?

i 2

Under ming VEY Agar ete ot

Think about it Larry. I'm your Golden
Hebe. Without my credibility everything
falls apart. So I dunno, maybe the
smartly move here is to just pretend
like this never happened? ---

Mel slides the photos towards Houseman.

MEL (CONT'D
Cause if you fuck me, you fuck yourself ---
hypothetically speaking.

Houseman stands there palpitating with rage, the desperation of
his predicament like a scar disfiguring his face.

HOUSEMAN
I wish the heart attack killed you.
128.

MEL

I understand that this is difficult,
and I don't blame you for being upset.
But it's like you said, Larry, when

it comes to protecting’ the foundations
of our democracy.

(cuts a grin)

Sometimes you need to take it in the
ass for the team.

INT. BATHROOM - MARRIOT HOTEL - MANHATTAN - DAY

Mel's cast is off and he's completely recovered. He stands in
front of a mirror in the bathroom --- adjusts his tie and primps
himself like an actor about to go on stage.

Max appears in the mirror in an open robe, nothing under it.
She comes up behind Mel and gives him a hug.

MAX
It's gonna be a helluva show.

MEL
Yeah.

She hands Mel a small, thin BOX which has been wrapped.

MEL (CONT'D)
What's this?

MAX
It's that thing you wanted me to wrap
for Jimmy.

MEL
Oh right, thanks.
(smiles, gesturing to box)
Hey -- This was a beautiful touch to
the play, Max. One of those genius
little details I never woulda come up
with on my own.

MAX
It wasn't that big of a deal.

MEL
No, I was there --- It was a moment.
(locks eyes in mirror)
I couldn't have pulled this off without
you.

Mel turns around to face Max --- locks eyes with her.

MEL (CONT'D)
I love you Max.

A vulnerable, soul-stirring expression cracks across Max's face ---
and she gives Mel a deep, sensuous kiss.

We suddenly hear a BANGING on the door.

GROSSWALD (0.S.)
Come on, Mel! We're gonna be late.
129.

Giving Max a final kiss, Mel begins to head out of the bathroom ---
but is stopped my her voice...

MAX
I love you too.

They exchange a terrified smile before Mel is out the door.
EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - MANHATTAN - DAY

The courtroom steps are a MEDIA CIRCUS --- Reporters, TV Crews,
Photographers all covering the first ABSCAM trial.

A_BLUE VAN pulls up. The doors open. Grosswald, Polk, and Boyle
all get out and form a human SHIELD around Mel. Mel uses a cane
to walk as they cut their way through the ocean of flashbulbs,
microphones and insanity.

INT. HALLWAY - FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - MANHATTAN - A LITTLE LATER

As Mel is ushered down the hall he suddenly catches sight of
Estelle, Willie and FRANK, Estelle's boyfriend, waiting by the
door to the witness chamber. Mel and Willie see each other and
huge smiles crack across both their faces...

 

MEL
Hey boychick, glad you made it ---
WILLIE
Me too Pop ---
MEL
So Grosswald here has got some prime
seats for you --- you're gonna be
sitting with all the FBI agents ---
WILLIE
Cool ---
MEL

why don't you go with him now ---
I'll catch up with you later...
Grosswald ushers Willie down the hall and into the courtroom ---
leaving Mel standing there with Estelle, Boyle and Frank...
After an awkward beat, Mel looks to Frank and Boyle.
MEL (CONT'D)

Could you guys give us a second?

Boyle and Frank step away giving them some privacy. Mel takes a
oO.

beat to admire Estelle --- she oks fabulous, better than we've
ever seen her --- as though she's bloomed.

MEL (CONT'D)
You look fantastic. Really ---

ESTELLE
Thanks, I feel good ---

MEL
You know I really appreciate you
bringing Willie down here --- so he

can see me like this ---
130.

ESTELLE

He's your son ---

Mel nods... and then gestures to Frank...

MEL

So how are you and Frank doing?
ESTELLE

Things are good --- this is better

for me --- you know?
MEL

I'm happy for you ---
ESTELLE

You'll drop Willie off at school
tomorrow morning?

MEL
Yeah.

ESTELLE
Break a leg up there...

With that, Estelle walks to Frank and they exit the courthouse
together. Boyle comes over and gives Mel an anxious look...

BOYLE
You ready?

MEL
Yeah.

Mel hands Boyle the gift box.

BOYLE
What's this?

MEL
A little souvenir. Nothing fancy. But
I thought you'd appreciate it.

Mel gives Boyle a smile and wink and disappears into the Witness
Chamber, the Bailiff closing the door behind him.

INT. COURTROOM - FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - MANHATTAN - LATER

The gallery's packed. Tension is thick. Congressman Ozzie Myers
and his Defense Team quietly confer on one side of the aisle.
Tuccio and his Staff are in a pregame huddle.

ANGLE CLOSE ON BOYLE, who's sitting in the last aisle opening
the gift. First he takes off the bow, then tears the paper
revealing a VELVET PEN BOX --- when suddenly ---

A solemn looking JUDGE appears behind the high bench.

COURT BAILIFF
All rise! This court is now in session
the Honorable Judge Henry Pratt
residing.

 

 

The court settles down, everyone takes their seat.
131.

JUDGE
; _(to bailiff)
Bring in the jury.

The jury files in and takes their seats.

JUDGE (CONT'D)

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Tuccio, do the people wish to
call their next witness?

TUCCIO
Yes, your Honor. The people call Melvin
Weinberg.

As the Bailiff leads Mel into the courtroom and ushers him
towards the witness stand, Boyle OPENS THE BOX in his hands.

Revealing; a cheap, gold-plated PEN and MECHANICAL PENCIL with
"BOARDWALK BANK" engraved onto the sides.

Boyle rubs his head --- like he doesn't want to smile --- he
doesn't want to laugh --- but he can't help it. He looks up at
Mel, shaking his head in reluctant awe and affection ---

ANGLE CLOSE ON MEL standing in the witness stand.

BAILIFF
Raise your right hand.
(Mel raises right hand)
Do you swear to tell the truth, nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

Mel turns, looks straight into the camera and cuts a razor-thin
almost imperceptible smile --- like a knife gleaming briefly
from concealment.

WE CUT TO BLACK.
AMERICAN BULLSHIT
The ABSCAM operation ultimately resulted in an unprecedented
number of arrests, but it was the indictment and conviction
of six U.S Congressmen and one U.S Senator that came to
define its legacy as one biggest political scandals in
American history.

In almost every case the accused claimed they were entrapped
by the FBI and used the tape of Mel’s “pep talk” with the
Senator to support this allegation. Nevertheless, the
defense was not able to overcome the power of the video
evidence of the defendants taking bribe money.

ABSCAM marred the public’s trust of Congress and its effect
on the Democratic Party was especially severe. The scandal
was one of the key factors that helped deliver the 1980
Presidential election to Ronald Reagan, which launched a
quarter-century long period of Republican rule in America.

ABSCAM’s impact on organized crime was no less significant
in that it helped undermine the Mafia’s master plan to
expand and control the gambling industry. After the scandal
broke every single ballot measure to legalize gambling was
defeated by the voters -- six different campaigns in six
different states.

As a result, the mob lost hundreds of millions of dollars
and the secret point holders were eventually forced to sell
their interests in Atlantic City casinos to the same
conglomerates who muscled them out of Las Vegas.

Today Mel Weinberg and Maxine Gardner reside in Florida.
