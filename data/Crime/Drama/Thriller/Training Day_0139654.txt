TRAINING DAY

Written by DAVID AYER

April 2001 Draft

FOR EDUCATIONAL
PURPOSES ONLY
FADE IN:
INT. JAKE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CLOSE ON ALARM CLOCK -
PREDAWN (4:59 AM)

In a Santa Clarita housing tract. It's dark.

WIDER ANGLE

Eyes glisten in the clock's shine, patiently watching the
time.

BZZZZ! The ALARM SOUNDS. A hand that's been hovering
over the clock drops. Silence. JAKE HOYT, a fit young
man, rolls over, throws an arm over his sleeping wife --

JAKE
It's time.

-- she's not there, just empty blankets. He sits up,
sporting a scraggly goatee, his hair growing out.
HIS POV

LISA, his wife, in a rocking chair in the corner.

BACK TO SCENE
Jake is surprised. How'd she sneak off?

JAKE
What are you doing up?

She pulls back the blanket, she breast-feeds their infant
daughter.

LISA
Mooooo.

She lavishes kisses on her baby.

CUT TO:

INT. JAKE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CLOSEUP - BRASSO - DAWN

is squirted on terry cloth. A badge is rubbed against it
in precise circles.

CONTINUED:
WIDEN TO:

Jake in T-shirt and jeans, studies the gleaming badge,
snaps it in its case, clips it to his belt. He tosses a
duffel on the counter. Searches through the police gear.
Lisa taps a police baton on his shoulder. He takes it.

JAKE
Thanks.

LISA
Wrong day to forget stuff.
Everyone's saying how lucky you
are. Don't screw this up.

He gives her a look, shoves it in the bag.

JAKE
She go back to sleep?

LISA
Mmm-hmm. Ate like a pig.

Jake does a final check of gun belt. Inspecting his
Beretta and magazines.

JAKE
I know how lucky I am. I ace this
assignment. Department's wide
open. Get my own division
someday. You should see those
guys' houses.

She grabs a pack of English muffins. Jake catches his
reflection in a mirror, rubs his chin. He doesn't like
the way he looks. Next to the mirror is his police
academy graduation photo -- Clean-cut, almost adolescent.
Lisa plays with his goatee, she likes it.

LISA

Want some eggs for the road?
JAKE

I gotta roll. Gotta beat the

traffic.

He shoves his gun belt in the duffel. Zips it shut. He
grabs a pressed uniform off a chair, and his police hat,
wrapped in plastic. He kisses Lisa's cheek, her neck,
her lips. Heads to the door. The PHONE RINGS. Jake
stops. Lisa answers.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

LISA
Hello?
(beat, laughs)
How nice, thank you.
(beat, giggles)
I will, don't worry.

Jake looks at her, wondering who the hell is making his
wife giggle so much.

LISA
He's right here.
(to Jake)

Jake. It's Alonzo.

Jake reacts, steels himself and takes the phone.

JAKE
Hello?

ALONZO (V.O.)
Hoyt?

JAKE
Yessir?

ALONZO (V.O.)
On your way to roll call?

JAKE
Yessir. I'm out the door right
now.

ALONZO (V.O.)
Hoyt.

JAKE
Yessir?

ALONZO (V.O.)

Patrol fairies go to roll call.
We don't go to roll call.

JAKE
Yessir.

ALONZO (V.O.)
There's a coffee shop at 7th

and Witmer. See you there at
ten. Be in civvies. Comfortable
shoes. Got a back-up gun?
Something pocket-sized?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)

JAKE
Nossir. Just my department
issue service pistol.

ALONZO (V.O.)

Bring it. Cuffs, too. We're
gonna be in the office all day,
but who knows, maybe we'll do some
business. We're an aggressive
unit.

JAKE
I know. That's why I signed up.
I want to thank you for giving me
the oppor --

-- CLICK! Alonzo hangs up. Jake too. He stands there,
grabs his nervous stomach.

LISA
What's wrong?

JAKE
Feel like it's football tryouts.
Wish it was tomorrow so I'd know
already if I made his squad or
not.

LISA
It's not tomorrow. It's today.
And it's gonna work out. I know
it will.

JAKE
I gotta relax.

Lisa looking at him. He gets an idea, snuggles up to
her.

JAKE
Don't have to show up until ten.
She breaks the embrace -- sore breasts -- Ouch!
JAKE

Soon they'll be mine again.

Jake chases them with cupped hands as she retreats,
giggling. Their game.

CUT TO:
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Old and tired, near Good Samaritan Hospital. Jake
struts through the door, confidently looks around.

JAKE'S POV

DETECTIVE SERGEANT ALONZO HARRIS, in black shirt, black
leather jacket. And just enough platinum and diamonds
to look like somebody. He reads the paper in a booth.
The gun leather-tough LAPD vet is a hands-on, blue-collar
cop who can kick your ass with a look.

BACK TO SCENE

Jake walks over. Slides in across. Alonzo's eyes will
never leave his newspaper.

JAKE
Good morning, sir.

A young waitress pours Jake coffee, offers a menu. Jake
waves it away.

JAKE
I'm okay, ma'am. Thank you.

ALONZO
Have some chow before we hit the
office. Go ahead. It's my
dollar.

JAKE
No, thank you, sir. I ate.

ALONZO
Fine. Don't.

Alonzo turns the page. A long beat. Then:

JAKE
It's nice here.
ALONZO
May I read my paper?
JAKE
I'm sorry, sir... I'll get some

food.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

ALONZO
No. You won't. You fucked that
up. Please. I'm reading. Shut
up.

Jake does -- Jeeez, sorry. Pours a ton of sugar in his
coffee.

TIME CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
The waitress pours refills. Alonzo reads. Jake fidgets.
JAKE
Sure wouldn't mind not roasting
in a hot black and white all
summer.

Alonzo sighs, carefully folds his paper. Glares at Jake.

ALONZO
Tell me a story, Hoyt.
JAKE
My story?
ALONZO

Not your story. A story. You
can't keep your mouth shut long
enough to let me finish my paper.
So tell me a story.

JAKE
I don't think I know any stories.

Alonzo waves the paper in Jake's face.

ALONZO
This is a newspaper. And I know
it's ninety percent bullshit but
it's entertaining. That's why I
read it. Because it entertains
me. If you won't let me read my
paper, then entertain me with your
bullshit. Tell me a story.

JAKE
A real one or should I make one
up?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

ALONZO
(sighs)
Where'd you do your probation?

JAKE
Van Nuys.

ALONZO
Right. The Valley. No cute
little anecdotes about writing
underage smoking cites at the
shopping mall?

Jake thinks. Bingo! He's got it.

JAKE
There was this D.U.I. stop.
ALONZO
A D.U.I. stop. Wow. Go on.
JAKE
We were on the mid-watch.
ALONZO
We? You and...?
JAKE
Debbie.
ALONZO
Debbie? The hell's Debbie?
JAKE
My training officer. Debbie
Maxwell --
ALONZO
-- Your T.O. was female?
JAKE
Yessir.
ALONZO
She white? Black?
JAKE
White.
ALONZO

She dyked out or she any good?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

(2)

JAKE
She's pretty good.

ALONZO
(he's hooked)
So you and Debbie are pullin' a
mid-watch?

JAKE
Right. It's a real quiet night.
A yawner. We're rolling on
Vanowen. I'm driving. And this
Acura, just a beautiful car, comes
out a side street. In excess.
All over the median. So I light
it up and hit the wailer. Guy
drives on like I'm invisible for
ten blocks before he pulls over.
Plates ran clean. Debbie covers
as I approach. Driver's this huge
white guy. Can barely keep his
eyes open. I field test and
arrest and I'm belting him in our
unit. Debbie's tossing his car.
She calls me to the vehicle and
shows me a snubbed .38 and two
shotguns, all loaded and locked.

ALONZO
No shit?

JAKE

No shit. She calls our supervisor
and I keep searching. I find five
hundred grams of meth in the dash.
Turns out our D.U.I. was on bail
for distribution. He was on his
way to smoke his ex-partner before
trial.

(proudly )
We prevented a murder.

Alonzo is astonished.

ALONZO
«+. amazing...

Jake beams -- some story, huh?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)
ALONZO
You're driving around the Valley
with a fine bitch in your car for
a year and the most entertaining
story you got is a drunk stop?
Never hit her up for some Code X
in the back seat? Didn't tap it?

JAKE
I have a wife.

ALONZO
You also have a dick.

Alonzo shakes his head in disgust. Jake is crushed.

ALONZO
Let's go.

Alonzo tosses a fifty on the table. OFF his heavy
wedding band we --

CUT TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - DAY
Jake and Alonzo crossing. Alonzo sizes Jake up.
ALONZO
You walk and talk like a damn
cop.

Alonzo stops at:

G-RIDE

A narc-machine supreme. A clean, black 1978 Monte Carlo
on nice rims.

ALONZO
Gimme that menu.

Jake pulls a Chinese menu from under the wiper. Hands it
to Alonzo, who folds and pockets it.

ALONZO
Get in. S'unlocked.

Jake admires the car, climbs in.

10.

INT. G-RIDE/EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 6

Jake buries his shoes in beer cans and coffee cups.
Alonzo twists the key and pumps the hell out of the gas.
After a beat, the ENGINE CATCHES -- VROOM!

JAKE
This isn't from the motor pool.

ALONZO
Don't worry. My baby puts out
when she has to.

Alonzo rubs the dash lovingly.
JAKE
Where's the office? Back at
Division?

Alonzo hits the switches and the G-Ride is raised by
hydraulics.

ALONZO
You're in it.
Jake reacts. Then smiles -- This is kinda cool.
INT. G-RIDE (7TH STREET) - MOVING - DAY AT

Alonzo SQUEALS out of the lot. They pass the formidably-
stylish Metropolitan Detention Center.

ALONZO
Rover's in the glove box. Wanna
ten-eight us?

JAKE
Yessir.

ALONZO
Shitcan the sirs. I'm not your
domestic violence awareness
instructor.

Jake takes a Motorola radio from the glove box.

JAKE
What's our I.D.?

ALONZO
Nora fifteen.

JAKE

(into Motorola)
Nora fifteen, ten-eight.

(CONTINUED)
AT

11.

CONTINUED: AT

DISPATCH (V.O.)
Nora fifteen, ten-twenty.

Jake checks the street signs -- 7th and Broadway.
Before he can tell Dispatch, Alonzo snatches the
Motorola as he makes a left on Broadway.

ALONZO
(into rover)
Nora fifteen, South on Rampart at
Beverly.

DISPATCH (V.O.)
Ten four.

Alonzo tosses Jake the rover.
ALONZO
Bad guys are listening. Don't
trust the radios. Never let
anyone know where you're really
at. Ever.

Jake nods and smiles -- makes sense.

CUT TO:

INT. G-RIDE (BROADWAY) - MOVING - DAY 7

Heading north on Broadway in downtown LA. It could be
San Salvador or Guatemala City. Jake is mesmerized by
the crowds.

JAKE
This looks like the Third World.

ALONZO
It's my world.

Jake notes several men making hand signs as they pass.

JAKE
They're flashing gang signs.

ALONZO
They're selling micas. Fake
I.D.s. Green cards, licenses,
socials.

Alonzo gives Jake a fatherly look, lights a smoke.
Settles in his seat.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

12.

ALONZO
Today's a training day. Gonna
show you around, give you a feel
for the business. I have thirty-
eight cases pending trial. I have
sixty-three active investigations.
There's another three hundred and
fifty cases on the log I can't
clear. I'm supervising five
officers. That's five different
personalities, five different sets
of problems. You, Officer Hoyt,
if you got the guts to succeed,
will be number six. I don't have
time to baby-sit or hold hands.
You have one day to show me who
you are and what you can or cannot
handle. You can't hack narcotics,
feel free to work a pussy desk
chasing bad checks. Hear me,
Officer Hoyt?

JAKE
I hear you.

ALONZO
Good. Gonna show you reality.
Think you can handle it?

JAKE
Yeah.

ALONZO
Why you wanna be a narc?

JAKE
I want to serve my community by
ridding it of dangerous drugs.

Alonzo gives him a look -- Don't b.s. me.

JAKE
I wanna make detective.

The boy is ambitious. Alonzo likes that. As they
cruise down Broadway, a black and white up the street
does a sudden U-turn.

ALONZO
Stick with me and you will. If
you can unlearn the bullshit
they've filled your head with.

ALONZO (CONT'D)
You gonna be passing out baseball
cards and carrying old ladies'
groceries like the rest of the
newfucks Washington's flooded the
streets with?

JAKE
I'll do anything you want me to
do.

ALONZO

Good. Roll your window down.
Can't hear the street.

ALONZO

Stand by, because narcotics ain't
about staying in the car and
looking good. I bet you write
great paper, Hoyt.

(before Jake

can answer)
You do. I checked it out. Cover
your area, cover your ass, but not
necessarily in that order, right?

JAKE
Right.

The two cops from the black and white have their guns
drawn on five hardcore cholos with tats on their
shoulders and heads. A white cop screams at them in
English, then switches to Spanish as his partner pours
beer on a cholo's head.

ALONZO
How's the Espanol?

JAKE
Mas o menos.

ALONZO

Work on it. People'll be plotting
the worst kind of shit behind your
back.

JAKE
Right. Are you going to teach me
that old school, hard-charging,
beat up everything that moves
Rodney King shit?

ALONZO
No way. I'm the new breed. I use
this...

(taps his head)
This is my tool.

The G-Ride crosses the lst Street Bridge, revealing Echo
Park spread before them.

INT. G-RIDE (1ST STREET BRIDGE) - MOVING - DAY A8

ALONZO

How long you been married?
JAKE

A year.
ALONZO

Gotta kid, right?
JAKE

(smiles)

A nine-month-old girl.

ALONZO
I got four kids. All boys. You
want a son, lemme know. I'll do
your old lady up. I can't miss.

Jake angers, although he knows he is being tested.

JAKE
Let's not talk about my family.

ALONZO
It's cool. I can respect that.
I'm married. I have my queen,
too. I remember what it's like to
have a pretty young bride. Bet
you still fuck her face-to-face.

JAKE
(clenched teeth)
Can we not talk about my wife?

(CONTINUED)
15.

A8 CONTINUED: A8

ALONZO
Kick back, kid... You're so in
love it's comin' out your eyes.
The day you bring the old lady to
the office is the day you don't go
home. If you don't hide your love
deep inside, maggots out here
will find it and chew it up.

Jake realizes Alonzo is right. Alonzo hands him a card.

ALONZO
That's our Chaplain, Lieutenant
Conelly. Give hima call. Invite
him and his wife over for dinner.
He's a good guy and no dumbshit.
You and your woman need any kinda
help, call him. I'm serious.

Jake takes the card. Kind of smiles.

JAKE
Thanks. I will.

They cruise a beat.

JAKE
Who's Mr. Clean?

Alonzo nails him with surprised look.

ALONZO
Where the hell you hear that?

JAKE
From a Valley Robbery Detective.
Told me to ask you that.

ALONZO
(smiles, shakes
his head)
Asshole.
8 EXT. G-RIDE (NETO'S STREET) - DAY 8

Alonzo pulls onto a street of dense apartments. Parks
along the curb.

JAKE
What's here?

(CONTINUED)
16.

CONTINUED: 8

ALONZO
Transactions... See the
Salvatrucha zero head on the fence,
trying not to look like he's
slangin'?

Jake looks, sees a young, bald cholo, Neto, just hanging
out.

ALONZO
That's Neto. Homeboy did three
years in the boyna roja. Red

beret.

JAKE
What's that?

ALONZO
Batallon de accion rapida

Atlacatl.

(off Jake's look)
El Salvadoran special forces.
Punk's only seventeen and can
kill with the best of them. Works
for me.

JAKE
Jesus. He an informant?

ALONZO
I got eyes everywhere. He gets to
peddle reefer, make a little cash
for the family. I get a heads-up
when shit goes down. The barrio
dot com.

JAKE
And you trust him?

ALONZO
Goddamn right I trust him. Sprung
his mom from I.N.S. detention.
Alonzo watches his mirror, perks up.
ALONZO
Here we go.
INSERT - MIRROR

A new VW Beetle pulls onto the street, moving slow.

(CONTINUED)
17.

CONTINUED: (2) 8
BACK TO SCENE
The VW passes the G-Ride. Jake glimpses three people
inside, two guys in front, a girl in back. Hipster
university students.
ALONZO

Shit's going down.
JAKE'S POV
The VW stops. Neto looks around, crosses to the driver's

window, a drink cup in hand. Neto plucks a foil pack
from the cup. Trades it for the driver's ten.

BACK TO SCENE
Neto walks away, disappears into some apartments.

ALONZO
See the hand-to-hand?

JAKE
I saw it.

The VW drives off, fast. Alonzo pulls out. Follows it.

ALONZO
When was your last felony stop?

JAKE
Couple weeks ago.

ALONZO
You need practice.

JAKE
They look like college kids.

ALONZO
They need a lesson. I want the
Brady Bunch grabbing glass. I got
front. You got back.

Alonzo pulls his gun. Jake reaches for the Motorola.

ALONZO
Stay off the rover.

Jake puts it away, pulls his gun. Alonzo stomps the gas.
The G-Ride HOWLS. The VW is at the corner, about to
turn!-—
18.

EXT. G-RIDE/VW BUS AT STREET CORNER - DAY 9
SCREEEEEECH! -- Alonzo slaloms to a stop, blocking its
path. His pistol aimed through Jake's window at the
DRIVER.

ALONZO
Police! Lemme see your hands!

Jake draws a bead on the girl in back.

JAKE
Police officers! Your hands!

The kids gawk at the two narcs for a stunned beat.

JAKE
Don't look at us! Look straight
ahead!

ALONZO

Driver and right front passenger!
Palms on the windshield!

JAKE
You in the back! Palms on the
side window! Look straight ahead!

ALONZO
Driver! Use your left hand, put
the vehicle in park.

The Driver is mortified because:

DRIVER
-.. it's a stickshift...

ALONZO
Shut up, dickhead! I'11 shoot
your face off! Take the keys out
of the ignition. Throw 'em out
the window!

The Driver does, quickly, as Alonzo jumps from the car,
charges the Driver, shoves the gun in his face. These
are just scared kids. The girl tries not to cry.

ALONZO
Fork it over, smartman.

DRIVER
What, sir?

Alonzo grabs his ear, tugs violently.

(CONTINUED)
19.

CONTINUED: 9

ALONZO
The marijuana I just watched
you purchase!

The Driver hands over the foil pack.

PASSENGER
I'm very sorry, sir. I didn't
know he was bringing me here.

ALONZO
Shut up, dumbass. You're here
now! Gimme that pipe!

There's an ornate pot pipe on the floor mat. The
PASSENGER picks it up. Reluctantly hands it to Alonzo.

PASSENGER
My mom gave me that pipe.

ALONZO
What else you got?

DRIVER
Cigarettes...?

ALONZO

Gimme those too.

He gives him a squished packed of Marlboro reds. The
kids realize Alonzo isn't your average cop. The girl
sees Neto standing down the block like nothing is going
on. She lowers her hands -- bad move.

ALONZO
Control your suspect, Hoyt!

JAKE
Miss! Palms on the glass!

Alonzo sees her lip quiver.
ALONZO
Cry and I slap the eyes outta your
face!
Back to the Driver.
ALONZO
You aware this is a gang

neighborhood?

That gives him pause -- no kidding -- Alonzo grabs his
ear again, shakes.

DRIVER

Yes, sir.
ALONZO

Thank you for your cooperation --
Safe your iron.

ON VW
Jake holsters his gun. Follows Alonzo to the G-Ride.
The kids lower their hands.

ON G-RIDE

Alonzo and Jake climb in. As they drive away, the girl
nails Jake with a look of revulsion. Jake reacts.

CUT TO:

INT. G-RIDE (NETO'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - MOVING - DAY 10

Alonzo laughing. Jake didn't like what happened. It
shows.

JAKE
Was that training? How to roust
students for dime bags?

ALONZO
They have no business being here.
Sooner or later that little smart-
ass white boy college puke is
gonna get jacked. I saved his

life.
JAKE
Taught him a real lesson.
ALONZO
Sure did, buy your shit on campus.

(beat)
I like your moves. Someone
trained you well.
Jake smiles to himself. Alonzo opens the foil, sniffs --

ALONZO
Shitty dime. Check it out.

He hands it to Jake. Who takes out a bud.

ALONZO
See the small hairs? The
undeveloped seeds. How it's all
stems?

Jake nods.

ALONZO
It was picked immature. See how
flat it is? Classic brick-pack
Mexican. See how brittle it is?
It's not bud season. It's from
last year.

Jake is amazed. Alonzo snatches the bud, crumbles it in
the pipe, tosses aside seeds.

ALONZO
To be truly effective, a narcotics
detective must know and love
narcotics. A good narcotics
detective should have narcotics in
his blood.

JAKE
You going to smoke that?

Alonzo smiles devilishly, offers Jake the pipe.

ALONZO
You are.
JAKE
Hell if I am.
ALONZO
What? You a Mormon? A Jesus
freak?
JAKE

No. I'm not losing my job.
ALONZO

This is your job.

Take a damn hit.

JAKE
I became a cop to keep people from

ALONZO

This ain't a review board. We
ain't doing rails. Just leafy
green bud.

Jake stands firm, shaking his head.

EXT. G-RIDE/ROGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 11

SCREECH! Alonzo stops in the middle of the street, pulls
his gun, jams it in Jake's ear. CARS behind them HONK.

ALONZO
If I was a dealer, you'd be dead.
Turn shit down on the street and
the Chief hands your wife a
crisply-folded flag.

Jake stares stubbornly at Alonzo. Alonzo pockets the
gun. Lights the lighter. And takes a huge hit, blows
smoke in Jake's face.

ALONZO
I don't want you in my unit. Not
even my division. Go back to
Valley. Get the fuck out of my
car.
A staring contest. Jake decides to play the game.

JAKE
«+. Okay...

He takes the pipe, takes an absolutely huge hit --
ALONZO
Alright. That's how it's done,
son.

-- And is racked with a spasm of coughing.

ALONZO
Betrayed by your virgin lungs.

driving, takes a hit. They pass the pipe around a few
times before Alonzo tosses it on the dash.

ALONZO
It's cashed.

INT. G-RIDE (ECHO PARK) - DAY Al2

They cruise in a strange otherworldly silence. Jake is
clearly messed up, his head lolls from side to side.

ALONZO
Shit, you took some man-sized
hits. You gonna be okay? When's
the last time you smoked out?

JAKE
... Twelfth grade...

INT. G-RIDE (SUNSET BOULEVARD) - DAY B12

ALONZO
Left that out of your service
jacket. Knew you had secrets,
everyone does. Didn't know you
dig dusters.

JAKE
What are dusters?

ALONZO
You know, dusted bud. Dippers?
C'mon, dipped in P.C.P. Primos.
Sherm, kool, P-dog, angel dust...
Didn't you smell it? Taste it?

JAKE
(horrified)
-+. I've never done it...

ALONZO
Now you have. Remember the smell
for next time. Think I'd inhale
that shit?
Jake is scared as hell, pale, sweaty.

JAKE
Oh, no. No. No. No.

JAKE
I'm gonna get piss tested. I'm
gonna get fired.
ALONZO
Lieutenant's got our backs. We
know a week before we piss.
JAKE
(panicking)
Shit. How could you do this to
me? Shit. Shit. Shit!
Alonzo slams an elbow across Jake's throat.
ALONZO
Chill and ride the high. You're
an adult. You chose to smoke.
Live with your decisions. You
cool?
JAKE
I'm cool.
ALONZO
Besides, no one put a gun to your
head.
Jake shoots him a look.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROGER'S HOUSE - DAY 12

A well-tended Craftsman on a steep hill of fixer-uppers

in Echo Park. The G-Ride parks out front.

Roger and Alonzo hug.
ALONZO
Did I wake you ?
ROGER
No. C'mon in. Please have a

seat.

Alonzo and Jake sit in big chairs. Three beepers, three
cell phones on the coffee table. Roger sits, takes a
bottle of whisky, three tumblers from a liquor cart.
Pours booze. Jake looks around at the modest traditional
furniture. The tacky porcelain figurines. Family photos
on the wall.

ALONZO
Alright. Time to get my swerve
on.
Roger gives Alonzo a concerned look.
ROGER
Heard you had a beef in Vegas.
There's a greenlight on your ass.

ALONZO
I'm cool. People talk shit.

ROGER
You know I got your back.

ALONZO
I know. Thanks.

They clink glasses. Jake doesn't. He stares into the
liquid, enraptured by its smoky patterns.

ALONZO
Jake, drink your medicine.

Jake takes a sip and winces. Roger tugs Jake's goatee.
Jake recoils.

ROGER
Went and got yourself a daisy-
fresh rookie.

Roger leans back in the couch. Jake is looking around
the room again. A BEEPER BEEPS. Roger checks it.
Ignores it. Roger studies Jake.

ROGER
Jesus, Alonzo. He's high as a
motherfucker. The hell you give
him?

Alonzo tosses the foil pack on the table. Roger takes
it, smells the PCP and shakes his head.

ROGER
Where'd you grow up?

JAKE
North Hollywood.

ROGER
What's your last name?

JAKE
Hoyt.

ROGER
(it clicks)
You play strong safety for North
Hollywood High?

JAKE
Yessir. How'd you know?

ROGER
I follow all the good players.

His BEEPER BEEPS. He checks it, sighs. Dials a cell
phone.

ROGER
(into phone)
It's me. Whassup?
(beat)
Can't do a thing for you. Your
mess. You clean it up. Don't be
callin' me.

He hangs up. Freshens the drinks.

ROGER

(to Jake)
Here's a joke, boy. One day this
man walks out of his house to go
to work. He sees this snail on
his porch. So he picks it up and
chucks it over his roof, into the
back yard. Snail bounces off a
rock, cracks its shell all to
shit, and lands in the grass.
Snail lies there dying.

A BEEPER BEEPS. Roger checks and ignores it.

ROGER
But it doesn't die. It eats some
grass. Slowly heals. Grows a new
shell. And after a while it can
crawl again. One day the snail up
and heads back to the front of the
house. Finally, after a year, the
little guy crawls back on the
porch. Right then, the man walks
out to go to work and sees this
snail again. So he says to it,
‘What the fuck's your problem?'

Jake stares at Roger a beat. Then starts laughing.
Really laughing. Maybe too much. He wipes his eyes.

JAKE
That's messed up. That wasn't
funny.

ALONZO
Then why are you cackling like a
jackal?

JAKE
I dunno.

ROGER

Figure that joke out and you'll
figure the streets out.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3) 13

ALONZO
Don't listen to him. There's
nothing to figure out. The
street's a buncha senseless

bullshit.
JAKE
Uh-uh. I got 'em figured out.
ROGER
You got the streets figured out?
JAKE
Yeah. It's all smiles and cries.
ALONZO
Give up. You're too high, space
captain.
ROGER
Hold on -- smiles and cries. I
hear you.
JAKE

You gotta control your smiles and
cries. No one can take them away

so... they're all we really have.
Roger and Alonzo trade looks -- sharp kid. Alonzo pats
Jake's shoulder. To Roger:
ALONZO
Think this greenhorn can handle

undercover?
Roger scrutinizes Jake a beat. Smiles and nods: yes.

ROGER
You were just like him.

ALONZO
(laughs )
Bullshit.
ROGER
Same silly-ass look and
everything. Saving the Goddamn
world.

ALONZO
That lasted a week.

Alonzo stands, shakes with Roger.

Roger gestures at the phones and beepers.

ROGER
Think I get out of the house?

A BEEPER BEEPS. Roger shakes with Jake.

ROGER
Take care, Hoyt. You're gonna do
okay.
CUT TO:
INT. G-RIDE (6TH STREET TO ALVARADO) - MOVING - DAY 14

East on Sunset. Jake senses he passed a test. Alonzo
smiling at him. Alonzo offers him a cigarette. Jake
accepts.

JAKE
What?

ALONZO
He liked you.

JAKE

Who is he? One of your snitches?

ALONZO
He's no snitch. He's a good man
to know. C'mon, let's find some
action in Niggertown.

(off Jake's look)

That's N-wordtown to you. What
are you, Hoyt? You ain't pure
whiteboy. You mixed?

JAKE
Italian, Irish and Mexican.

ALONZO
No shit? You're all dicked up.

Jake looks green, tosses the cigarette out the window.
Alonzo senses what's coming and SLAMS on the BRAKES,
flings open Jake's door. Jake vomits. A beat of dry
heaving.

ALONZO
Okay, well's dry, kid.
JAKE
Sorry.
ALONZO

Wipe your chin.

Alonzo hands Jake a handkerchief. Jakes wipes his sweaty

face.
JAKE
I'm cool. Had to unload the
groceries.
ALONZO

You gotta learn how to party. To
handle a high. It's a necessary
job skill. I'm not kidding. It's
an alcohol world down here. You
gotta be able to hang. To get
wasted and talk shit with sketchy
sociopathic dumbasses and not pass
out and get your shoes stolen.

JAKE
I'm fine, just a little dizzy.

Alonzo lights a smoke, leaning on his car, cracks a brew.
ALONZO
Oh, damn!
JAKE'S POV
A beautiful Mexican woman pushing a baby carriage.
CAMERA PLAYING OVER her in luscious SLOW MOTION.

ALONZO

I like my meat dark. C'mon, get

EXT. G-RIDE (MACARTHUR PARK) - MOVING - DAY B15
Alonzo sees Jake has his eyes closed.
ALONZO
C'mon, man. Open your eyes.
You'll make it worse.

Nothing.

ALONZO
Sit your ass up. Hoyt!

Jake locks bleary red eyes on Alonzo, jokingly:

JAKE
Who're you?

ALONZO
The Goddamn zig-zag man.

JAKE
Cool. I'ma cop.

You're a little bitty boot.

Alonzo cracks beers for him and Jake.

ALONZO
C'mon. It helps. Believe me.
Gives you ballast.

Jake takes one. Alonzo drives over the 6th Street
bridge. Jake drops his beer, soaking his leg.

ALONZO
Dumbass.

He leans his head on the window pillar, feeling better.
Jake's eyes absorb the street's tableau of unworldly
beauty gliding by. Palm trees and sunshine. Paradise
and hell in one. His lids begin to drift shut. Then
Jake sees a flash of movement in an alley. Suddenly
alert, he paws at the door handle.

JAKE
Activity on the right! Stop the
car!
ALONZO
Siddown, Hoyt. Everything's fine.
JAKE
Stop the car!
ALONZO

C'mon, relax. You're tripping.
Jake grabs the gearshift, throws it in reverse. The
transmission GRINDS, TIRES SCREECH. The ENGINE STALLS.
Jake is out like a shot --
EXT. STREET/CRACKHEAD ALLEY - DAY 15
-- he dodges an oncoming car.

ALONZO
Get your ass back here!

ON G-RIDE
Alonzo pulling to the curb.

ALONZO
Dumb-ass kid.

Running like a deer. He enters the alley. Sees a book
bag on the ground -- A dumpster ahead. Jake rounds it.
Fast.

HIS POV

A devastatingly-beautiful Latina SCHOOLGIRL is pinned
against the wall by a tall CRACKHEAD. Her nose dots
blood on her uniform blouse.

BACK TO SCENE
The Crackhead hauls back to smack her. Jake charging.

JAKE
Police officer! You're under
arrest!

The Crackhead punches Jake's throat. Stops him cold.
Jake realizes how huge this guy is. Gulp.

CRACKHEAD #1
Gonna fuck you too, cop.

ANOTHER CRACKHEAD dives from the shadows and tackles
Jake. Both go down hard. Jake gets his arm around
Crackhead #2's neck, squeezes -- the forbidden choke
hold.

Crackhead #1 stomps on Jake's head.

Alonzo drives the G-ride into the alley. Sits in the car
and enjoys the action.

Jake rides out Crackhead #1's vicious kicks as Crackhead
#2 convulses from hypoxia. And finally goes limp. Jake
lets go, sweeps Crackhead #1's legs out from under him
and hops to his feet. Crackhead #1 stands too.

CRACKHEAD #1
Your ass is doomed.

Jake growls, snatches him up like a rag doll, spins him,
slams him hard. Ina flash, Jake twists him into a
pretzel, drops a knee on his neck, grinds his head into
the asphalt. Clicks on the cuffs.

CRACKHEAD #1
We didn't do shit. Bitch is crazy
and shit.

Crackhead #2 coming to, starting to stand. Jake crosses
to him, pins his head with his knee. Slips a pair of
flexicuffs from his sock, zips them on the man's wrists.

(CONTINUED)

CRACKHEAD #2
Man, you messin' up, slick.
Homegirl tradin' her ass for
cookies.

JAKE

(bellows in rage)
Shut the fuck up, sir!

ANGLE ON ALONZO

He casually exits the G-ride with a smile, impressed by

Jake's raw skill.

JAKE
Thanks for the help.

ALONZO
Shoulda shot ‘em.

Jake crosses to the Schoolgirl.

JAKE
We're police officers. You okay?
You hurt?

SCHOOLGIRL

(to the Crackheads)
You're dead! My cousins are
from Trece Flats. They're gonna
blast you fools! Pinche mayates!

ALONZO
Miss! Relax! Are you okay?
SCHOOLGIRL
What? No. No, I'm not okay.
Lookit my nose... My mom's gonna

trip out.
Alonzo gingerly examines her nose.

ALONZO
Honey, it's just a nosebleed. Put
ice on it. Don't be walkin'
around here alone. Tell your
cousins to get your back. You
know what those piecesa shit were
gonna do. Probably got AIDS. Why
aren't you in school?

SCHOOLGIRL
I was going to a ditch party.

Go home. Go home, now.

She grabs her book bag and gets out of there.

JAKE
I gotta get her statement.
ALONZO
Unhook 'em. We're not racking up
arrests.
JAKE
(shocked)

Kick 'em loose?

ALONZO
No. Get some shots in first.

JAKE
I have a punching bag at home. I
want them off the street.

Alonzo squats by Crackhead #1. Searches him.

ALONZO
Hear that, bro? My dog, here,
wants to lock you up. Been to the
bootyhouse? Grabbin' ankles for
the big boys?

CRACKHEAD #1
Suck my dick, bitch. I know
people.

ALONZO
Kick back, who's-who.

Alonzo finds rocks in one sock. Some twenties in the
other. He pockets the cash and crack. Searches
Crackhead #2.

ALONZO
Where's your horn?

CRACKHEAD #2
Ain't got no horn.

Alonzo finds a glass pipe.
ALONZO
So what's this, chief? Gonna make
you eat it.

(CONTINUED)

Instead, Alonzo grinds it underfoot.

ALONZO
You, stand up.

Alonzo hauls Crackhead #1 to his feet. Unlocks the
cuffs, tosses them to Jake. Crackhead #2 strains against
the flexicuffs.

ALONZO
(to Crackhead #2)
You get to keep those. Want to go
to jail or go home?

He steers Crackhead #1 to a wall -- cocks his fist.

ALONZO
Ain't the first honey y'all pinned
to a wall, huh? Close your eyes.

Crackhead #1 does. Alonzo knees his groin -- oof! -- He
falls to the ground, whimpers in the fetal position.

ALONZO

Lucky I got pressing business.
Next time I cut your dick off and
shove it up your ass.

(pats Jake's

back, winks)
I'll leave you three alone for
some quality time. Gonna grab
some beer.

Alonzo gets in the car, backs out of the alley. Jake
watches Crackhead #1 whimper; Crackhead #2 writhes in the
gutter. It's futile to beat these men. Jake takes pity,
walks away.

CRACKHEAD #2
Pussy-ass fool. Gonna see your
ass again. Gonna fuck you up,
bitch. Won't see shit coming.
Creep like a ninja and crack your
head open. Blow your house up.
Punk-ass white boy. Now you in my
world, motherfucker.

Jake stops and turns around. He stoops to pick up a pink
plastic change purse.

CRACKHEAD #2
She all woman. Tax that ass for
days.

Man! Jake could kick his brains out. Somehow, he turns
and walks away.

CUT TO:

INT. G-RIDE (LONG BEACH AVE.) - MOVING - DAY 16

Jake steams. Alonzo offers a beer from a new sixer.
Jake refuses. Alonzo counts and pockets the money he
took. Notes Jake's stare.

ALONZO
Wanna book sixty bucks? Where're
the suspects?

JAKE
You let them go.

ALONZO
Get over it. You wanna go runnin'
and gunnin', stay in patrol. This
is Investigations. Leave the
garbage for the garbage men.
We're professional anglers. We
reel in the big ones. Shoulda
dished out some shoe leather.
You'd have a big 'ol smile on your
face.

JAKE
I get my shits and grins booking
bad guys, not beating them.

Those hemorrhoids woulda killed
you without mercy or hesitation.

JAKE
That's why they belong in prison.

ALONZO
They lost their money, their rock,
got beat down and now the eses
from Trece Flats are gonna smoke
‘em. Jesus, what more do you
want?

JAKE
Justice.

ALONZO
Is that not justice?

JAKE
That's street justice.

ALONZO
What's wrong with street justice?

JAKE
Let the animals wipe themselves
out, right?

ALONZO
God willing. But it don't work
like that. They wipe out the good
folks. It's always school kids,
mommies and ass-bustin' family men
catching stray slugs in their
noodles. You protect the flock by
catching the wolves. And it takes
a wolf to catch a wolf.

JAKE
What?

ALONZO
You protect --

JAKE

I heard you. Whatever.

JAKE
When do you lock anyone up? Seems

Bad mistake. Alonzo slaps him. Glares at him.

ALONZO
Shut up, boot! Nothin' but shit
‘tween your ears. They build
prisons cause a me! Judges have
handed out fifteen thousand man
years of incarceration time based
on my investigations. My record
speaks for itself. How many
felons have you collared?
Dickhead.

Now that it's clear who's the boss, they drive in tense
silence for a long beat. Alonzo digs in his pocket --

ALONZO
Here...

-- hands Jake the rocks he found. A beat.

JAKE
I'm not smoking crack.

ALONZO
Good. I'm glad to hear that.
Toss 'em in the glove box.

Jake does, sees several more rocks under some papers.

ALONZO
Comes in handy. Like a credit
card.
(offers Jake a beer)
You earned it. C'mon.

Jake refuses.

ALONZO

No matter what I say, I want you
to know, you did the right thing.
Reminds me of when I could chase
down anyone and rock their world.
You're a good cop. You got fire.
That was some amazing shit back

You did what you had to do.

Alonzo gives Jake a beer and grins at him like a proud
dad.

ALONZO
You got a magic eye, Hoyt. You
have a goddamn magic eye. Up your

damage, crime fighter.

They clink cans. Jake smiles.

CUT TO:

EXT. CENTRAL AVE. AND SLAUSON - DAY 17

If you don't know the neighborhood, stay the hell out. A

through the intersection, oozing menace. Then the G-Ride
rolls through the intersection.

CUT TO:

INT. G-RIDE (CENTRAL AVE.) - MOVING - DAY 18
The area fills Alonzo's eyes with memories.

ALONZO
Did my probation here. Learned a
lot on these blocks. Kicked some

Alonzo turns on McKinley. He reaches over, digs in the
glove box. Pulls out a photograph and hands it to Jake.

INSERT - PHOTO

A spit-and-polish, young cop in crisp blues, white
gloves, holding his pistol at inspection arms.

BACK TO SCENE
Jake looks at the photo, then at Alonzo. Realizing:

JAKE
You're Mr. Clean.

ALONZO
I had a few misconceptions when I
started out.
(notes a graffited
wall)
Shit's going down. See that?

Several black and whites, crime-scene tape. A coroner's
van. Flares block the street. A rookie gestures for
Alonzo to stop.

Alonzo badges him and drives around a bullet-riddled
Cutlass with two dead gangsters spilling out the open
doors. Jake gawks, Alonzo is utterly nonplussed.

ALONZO
Learn to read walls, not just
street signs.

Alonzo turns down an alley. Then pulls onto a boulevard.
After a block, he pulls into a different neighborhood.
Alonzo glimpses some pit bulls down a driveway. A beat
later he points out a house.

ALONZO
On the left. See that house?
Dude named Spooky lived there.
Mean old vato loco. Mexican
Mafia. No one messed with Spooky.
Even got respect from the cops.
We'd keep an eye on his house.
You like dogs?

JAKE
Gotta six-year-old Rottweiler.
Not too bright, but he's good with
my kid.

ALONZO
Rotties are good dogs. Dobermans
are better. Spooky raised
Dobermans. On my second week of
patrol, when I was not knowin'
shit, we roll by Spooky's one
night. I observe this old, black
fool named Too Fine, all drunk,
beating the shit out of this
female Doberman. Beautiful dog,
seven months old. Too Fine's
whoopin' her with a garden hose.
This dog's just crying, shaking.
I grew up with Dobermans. I was
pissed. I tell my T.O. 'I'm gonna
take him.' And my T.O. is like:
'No, no. It's cool.' He waves to
Too Fine and this motherfucker
smiles and waves back and keeps
hitting the dog.

me in the eye and says: 'Teaches
‘em to hate niggers.' Almost quit
right there. Almost got out of
that black and white and took the
bus home.

Jake looks at Alonzo.

JAKE
That's fucked-up. That's one of
the most whacked things I ever
heard.

ALONZO
Just remembered that. Every time
I'd seen it all, the street'd show
me something even more twisted. I
know you didn't see no shit like
that in the Valley.

Jake searches the Dealer as rows of display heads stare

Jake is stunned. Alonzo inspects the spattered sidewalk.
Sees Saran-wrapped rocks.

Honor Ranch.

ALONZO

CLICKING. The door is unlocked, opened. SANDMAN'S WIFE,
an attractive black woman, stands on the other side of
the security screen. Alonzo waves the menu.

ALONZO
Search warrant. Unlock the door
and back away.

She does, Alonzo snaps it open, rushes in, Jake follows.

INT. SANDMAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 27
Jake and Alonzo swinging guns around the room -- two

scared toddlers in a playpen. Sandman's Wife sits on the
couch.

JAKE
Stand up, ma'am.

He searches the couch for a weapon.

ALONZO
Anyone else in the house, ma'am?

SANDMAN'S WIFE
My nephew, Dimitri. He in the
bedroom. The boy is ten.

ALONZO
Cover her. Gonna clear the house.

Alonzo marches Dimitri, 10, into the living room. The
youngster trembles.

ALONZO
S'okay, son, we're the good guys.
Go sit on the couch with your
aunt -- House is code-four. Gonna
start my search.

Alonzo exits. Sandman's Wife glares at Jake.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
I wanna read the warrant.
Supposed to give me a copy.

JAKE

My partner has it.

She looks out the window at the empty street.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Where's your back-up?

JAKE
Ma'am, please be quiet while we
conduct our investigation.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
You got the gun, boss.

Crooked-ass pigs.

The kids stare at Jake like an occupying soldier. He
crosses to Dimitri, smiles.

JAKE
Hey, little man. How's it going?

Jake tries to shake. Dimitri crosses his arms, looks
away. Sandman's Wife smirks. 0O.S., the SOUNDS of Alonzo

Alonzo is suddenly quiet. Jake backs to the doorway,
peeks around it. Sees a dresser with a mirror.

IN MIRROR

Alonzo shoves something big down his jacket.

BACK TO SCENE

JAKE
Siddown. Now.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Gonna shoot me, boss? Kids, don't

Alonzo enters, excited, grinning.
ALONZO
Didn't find shit. Let's go --

Sandman's Wife bursts out of the house, screams at Jake and
Alonzo as they climb in the G-Ride.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Y'all jackers! You ain't no damn

She sees the gangsters.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Why y'all standin' there lookin'

The gangsters trade looks. Start running towards --

Alonzo sees the gangsters. Tries STARTING the CAR. The
engine won't catch.

ALONZO
C'mon, baby. Don't do me like
that.
The gangsters getting closer.

ALONZO
You bitch! Start!

Jake sees a Glock pulled from a waistband.

JAKE
Gun! Gun! Gun!

VAROOM! Alonzo SQUEALS from the driveway.

The armed gangster drops to one knee. The G-Ride tear-

Alonzo rounds the corner, tosses the wounded cans out the

ALONZO

Jake fingers the hole in the dash.

ALONZO
Gun! Gun! Gun!

Jake startles, Alonzo laughing.

ALONZO
First time you been shot at?
JAKE
(lies)
No.
ALONZO
Yeah, it was. Take the jacket
off.

Jake does, Alonzo takes whatever is in his jacket, wraps
it in the raid jacket and sets it at his feet.

JAKE
That wasn't cool. That wasn't
cool at all. Where's the Sandman?
What the hell were you doing in
there?

ALONZO
Looking for narcotics activity.
Scales. Baggies. Guns. Coke.

daisy-fresh boot. You tell me
what.

ALONZO
I don't deny my shit stinks. I
will never deny that. So why do I
got the best arrest and conviction
record in the county. Why?
‘Cause I don't handicap myself
with bullshit.

JAKE
I thought that bullshit served a
purpose.

ALONZO

You thought wrong. There's

some profoundly evil people
walking free on the streets right
now who've killed three, four, five
people. I know it, they know it,
every detective on payroll knows it.
Why do these turds still float
around? The rules. I take down
the duly deserving. I'm not
locking up Mr. Nine-to-five,
Mr.!Family Provider.

Jake shaking his head angrily.
ALONZO
C'mon, communicate. What aren't
you saying? Talk to me.
A beat. Then Jake fixes Alonzo with a stare.
JAKE
I think... I think you're a rogue
cop.
Alonzo laughs his ass off. Wipes his eyes, he laughs so
hard. Ahead on the freeway, a Highway Patrol cruiser is
on the opposite shoulder.

and handcuffs because of you.
With the scandals and whatnot,
it's open season on misconduct.
They'11 nail us to the wall.

(worried, repentant)
God, what the hell did I just do?

Alonzo holds up a finger for him to stop and pulls over
on the shoulder opposite the cruiser. A highway patrolman
helps a distressed female motorist change a tire.

ALONZO
You're in a privileged position to
learn a thing or two if you can
keep your mouth shut and your eyes
open. If you're serious about
doing good in the real world,
this is the place to learn how.
Gun! Gun! Gun! If this shit
shakes you up, go back to Division
and cry to the Watch Commander.
He'll find you a nice job lighting
flares and measuring wrecks. Decide
now if you want to be a wolf or a
sheep. If you want on my squad,
I'll sign your card.

Alonzo stops the car. Alonzo puts his foot on the dash,
reveals his unit's tattoo on his ankle. Jake reacts.

ALONZO
Get your ink.
(re: the patrolman)
Or get out and give him a hand.

Alonzo reaches over and opens Jake's door. Jake looks
around, looks at the tattoo. Forget it, he's out. Jake
exits the car. Jake stands on the shoulder, squints at
the patrolman fighting lugnuts. Jake knows what he
wants to do. He gets back in the G-ride. Slams the
door and nails Alonzo with a steely look of resolve.

JAKE
I'm in.

Alonzo holds out his hand. Jake shakes, serious.

Jake nervously glances around one of the toughest parts
of the city. A strong point adorned with wrought iron
and concertina wire. Alonzo looks around cautiously,
puts his gun in his lap, wary.

JAKE
What are you doing? We'll be
killed coming in here.

ALONZO
Oh, you've heard about this neck
of the woods?

JAKE
This is the Jungle. They said
never come in here with anything
less than a platoon.

EXT. G-RIDE (CUL-DE-SAC) - MOVING - DAY 39

Alonzo enters a cul-de-sac of run-down houses and
apartments. Formidable fences line the entire block. A
fortress.

ALONZO
This is the heart right here. The
headquarters. A lot of murder
investigations lead here. One way
in, no way out. Strictly heavy
hitters. Damus don't play.

A little kid runs out of the corner house. He eyes
Alonzo, then hops on his bike and rides OUT OF VIEW into
the cul-de-sac. A beat. The little kid returns. Waves
Alonzo into the cul-de-sac. Alonzo turns onto the
dangerous dead-end, driving around a poorly-parked van.

ALONZO
Lots of eyes on us right now.
Never come up in here without me.
For your safety. I'm serious.

JAKE
Okay. Why do you have a golden
pass?
The little kid gives Jake an unsettling maddog stare.
ALONZO
Because I'm square with 'em. But
they know if the line is crossed,
I'm leading the platoon in here.
Two solid, early teen gangsters lean against a fence.
One claps sharply. Alonzo gestures for Jake to look up
through the windshield.
JAKE'S POV

A dozen pigeons dive from the sky, right at the G-ride.

BACK TO SCENE

Jake reacts. The gangster claps his hands again and the
pigeons pull out of their dive and arc back into the sky.
The gangster smiles at Alonzo.

JAKE
What the hell was that?

ALONZO
They're flipping pigeons to let
folks know I'm here.
Jake looking at Alonzo, lost. Alonzo grins.

GANGSTER
‘Sup, Lonz. Thanks for helping
my cousin.

ALONZO
I got your back, dog.
(re: Jake)

He's my people.

Alonzo pushes open the gate. The gangsters regard him
coldly as he passes.

NEW ANGLE

Behind Alonzo's back, the gangsters' disposition becomes
disdain.

GANGSTER
Sick'a that pig actin' like king-

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY 40

Kids play in the bare dirt yard. A huge pit bull is chained
to a tree.

JAKE

And those guys?

ALONZO
Punk ass fools. I got all these
busters under my thumb.

An old woman sweeps her doorstep and glares at Jake.

ALONZO
Buenas tardes, Dona Lucila.

The old woman smiles, nods. Jake and Alonzo cross to
some stairs, climb the steps. A 15-year-old girl exits
with a laundry basket. Alonzo leers.

ALONZO
Gonna throw her dad in jail.
Raise her up myself. Like veal.

Jake reacts, unsure if Alonzo is joking.

The living room is filled with Salvadoran kitsch. It's
bright, airy, a refuge. A 2-year-old boy on the couch
watches cartoons. Alonzo motions for Jake to sit.

ALONZO
You had a rough morning. Relax
and let her hook you up.

He disappears into the bedroom. Sara hands Jake the
remote.

SARA
Here. Take this. I have cable.
You watch what you want. This is
your house. Don't be shy.

She crosses to the kitchen. Sounds of POTS, DISHES.
Jake is about to change the channel. The kid gives hima
look. He puts away the remote.

Sara returns with a massive tray of food, chicken stew,
beans, rice, salad, tortillas, the works. She sets the
mouth-watering spread before Jake.

Jake stirs, stretches. Stands. Alonzo shows him the

ALONZO
Go to the car.

JAKE
I'd like to thank her for the

Jake tussles the kid's hair.

No, thanks. I get mine at home.
ALONZO
You're missing out. I should

JAKE

Her kid looks just like you. He's

ALONZO
Number six.

JAKE
Six kids. That's all? Or you

houses?

ALONZO
I'm only aware of six.

JAKE
It's easy to make a baby --

Jake overhears:

ALONZO
You'll get the damn money.

Alonzo hangs up, exits the car uncharacteristically shaken.
He and Jake cross to the entrance. Alonzo slips an old
man polishing shoes a twenty. Alonzo, the raid jacket

Leather booths and big, padded chairs. It's empty. Save

immaculate suits, DOUG, STAN, and LOU, share a top-notch
cabernet.

Doug and Stan see Alonzo, react like they've seen a
ghost. Lou turns, sees Alonzo. And quickly stands.
It's tense. Like there could be a gunfight. Jake's
hand creeps to his gun. Alonzo and Lou converge,

Alonzo grabs Jake's shoulder, pulls him into the huddle.
Jake notes none wear shoes.

ALONZO
This is Jake Hoyt, first day in my

Jake shakes Lou's hand. Sees an LAPD Captain's badge on
his belt. Jake realizes these guys are police
administrators.

ALONZO
Jake, this is Lou Jacobs. You

talk to this man first. He'll
get your back.

JAKE
Pleased to meet you, sir.

is a little nervous.

PAUL
You say we get away with it, let's
hit this fool -- Who's this?

JAKE
Jake Hoyt. First day in the unit.
I'm coming from Valley patrol.

He holds out his hand. Paul scoffs.

PAUL
You're a long way from Starbucks.
(to Alonzo)
Why's he in on this shit?

ALONZO
Gotta pop his cherry sometime.

PAUL
(to Jake; peeved)
Stay the hell outta my way, little
puppy. This is big dog work.
Alonzo notes Jake's unease, shows him the warrant.

It's the real deal. Signed by the

(addresses everyone)
Our safety comes first. He gives
us shit, we give him lead. Let's
do this right so everyone can go
home and do the wife and girl
friend thing tonight.

(checks his watch)
Suit up, ladies. Time to punch
in.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROGER'S HOUSE (ALLEY) - FENCE - DAY 50

Five cops crouch outside a gate with shotguns, MP-5s.
Assault vests and helmets worn over civvies. Jake and
Jeff to one side. Paul, Mark and Tim to the other.
Alonzo crosses to the gate with boltcutters and snaps the
padlock. The five cops open the gate and run to --

EXT. ROGER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 51
The back door of the little house. Paul and Mark kick it
open. Wood splinters. The five cops rush inside.

INT. ROGER'S HOUSE - DAY 52
The cops run through the kitchen into a familiar living
room. A familiar one -- This is Roger's house. Jake is
surprised, confused.

Roger reads on the couch, the morning paper. He's
nonplussed to find himself surrounded by police, weapons.

MARK
Freeze up! You need to not move,
breathe, think or blink.

ROGER

What are you clowns doing here?
PAUL

Shut up! -- New guy! His hands

move, blast him.
Jake aiming his shotgun at Roger's head.

CONTINUED: 52

JAKE
I'm on him.

Roger, holding his newspaper, recognizes Jake.

ROGER
You know what you're doing, son?

Jake nods: yes. The truth is; he doesn't.

PAUL
Drop what's in your hands. Before
zero. Five. Four. Three. Two.

CLUNK-CLUNK! Two tiny derringers hit the coffee table.
Roger had been palming them. Paul sweeps them aside with
his foot. The cops relax a little. Roger folds his
paper. Sets it down, takes off his reading glasses. A
principal besieged by truants.

ROGER
Alonzo's gonna kill you guys.

Alonzo enters the shattered door. Holding picks,
shovels. He drops the tools. They crash to the floor.
Roger crosses his arms and glares at his friend.

ROGER
What's going down, Alonzo?

ALONZO
I had lunch with the three wise
men. You gotta render unto
Caesar.

Roger sees the tools and knows exactly what they are for.

ROGER
Those goddamn vampires want my
pension.

ALONZO

No, man, it's not like that.
You're just getting taxed. They
got their boat payments and God
knows what. I'm sorry. They're
makin' me do it. I'm just a lowly
civil servant.

ROGER
Bullshit. You're their bitch.
What happens with me?

ALONZO
Don't worry, bro. I promised
you'd never go back to prison. I
got your back. You won't even
miss what I'm gonna take. I hate
doing this. Orders is orders.
Sorry, dog.

ROGER
No, you ain't. Cop.

ALONZO
(to Tim and Jeff)
You guys are gonna work. Get the
tools.
(grabs Jake's
shotgun)
Gimme the boomer.

Tim and Jeff gather the tools. Alonzo hands Jake a pick
and leads the three men to the kitchen. Roger pours a
slug of Crown Royal as Paul and Mark guard him.

ROGER
Who's paying for my floor?
ALONZO
The city.
INT. ROGER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 53

Alonzo flips the table. Taps the floor with his toe.

ALONZO
Open the floor. Right here.

Jake, Tim and Jeff begin chopping. It's quick work to
tear a large hole in the wood.

ALONZO
Hop in, Hoyt. Couple a feet down,
there's a locker.
Jake jumps in. Attacking dirt with his pick.

CUT TO:

INT. ROGER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY (10 MINUTES LATER) 54

Jake, Tim and Jeff haul a trash-bag-wrapped footlocker
out of the hole.

JAKE
What's in it?

ALONZO
Open it.
Jake tears away trash bags. Alonzo takes a pick and
snaps the lock. Jake opens the lid -- taped bundles
inside.

JAKE
It's coke?

Alonzo hands him a penknife.

ALONZO
Cut the damn thing open.
Jake does -- it is a brick of fifty dollar bills. Alonzo
is relieved to see the money. Jake likes its heft.
JAKE
This is sweet.
ALONZO

That's a hundred grand in your hot
little hands. There's four
million bucks in there.

Alonzo slaps Jake's back.

ALONZO
First day on the job and you're in
on a three million dollar seizure.

JAKE
You said four.

ALONZO
Told you, nothing's for free.
Gotta grease the rails to make the
big moves.

Alonzo grabs a shopping bag. Tosses bricks of fifties
in it. Hands it to Jake.

ALONZO
Here. Lucky to get this, day-one-
motherfucker.

JAKE

What's this?

CONTINUED: (2) 54

ALONZO
Sweet green clean legal tender.
Start the kid's college fund
early. Get the old lady a
minivan.

However pleasant the heft, Jake could never accept. He
returns the shopping bag to Alonzo.

JAKE
No way. Only checks I cash say
City of L.A. on ‘em.

JEFF
Someone didn't sleep through
Ethics.
ALONZO
You said you wanted a piece.
JAKE
Not like this.
ALONZO

I understand. I'1l hold on to it
for you. Not everyone's
comfortable the first time --
Let's wrap up.

Alonzo drops the bag in the locker. Exits. Jake,
Tim and Jeff follow.

CUT TO:

INT. ROGER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 55

Roger reads a Vegas odds paper. Alonzo, Tim, Jeff and
Jake enter. Roger glares at Alonzo.

ROGER
What have I done to those guys?
Are they nuts? Am I supposed to
stand still and let them horsefuck

me?

ALONZO
No. We can put you out of your
misery.

Alonzo tosses Jake the shotgun.

ALONZO
Lemme tell you a secret, Hoyt. If
you kill someone on duty, they
have to be your slave in the
afterlife.
(points to Roger)
There you go. Start an entourage.

JAKE
You want me to shoot him?

Paul, Mark, Tim and Jeff snicker, crack smiles. Roger
too. Jake plays along, points the shotgun at Roger.

ROGER
You'd be doin' me a favor, kid.

JAKE
Bang -- There.

He lowers the weapon.

ALONZO
Not gonna do it?

JAKE
Of course not. This isn't funny.

Alonzo smiles. Takes the shotgun from him.
ALONZO
Man, youngsters these days. Can't
get shit done unless you do it
yourself.
Alonzo aims at Roger. Roger suddenly understands.

ROGER
This is all you...

BOOM! Roger is punched ragged with BUCKSHOT, lifted off
his couch, knocked into the wall.

Jake jumps back. A peal of laughter from Tim.
Contagious giggles from the others. Roger gurgles. Jake
stares wide-eyed at Alonzo.

JAKE
Holy shit!

Jake's shock elicits more giggles from the squad.

PAUL
Finish him.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2) 55
Jake watches Alonzo cross to Roger, blindly gasping.

ALONZO
He's finished.

Alonzo takes one of Roger's derringers from the floor.
Slaps it in the dying man's hand.

ALONZO
C'mere, Jeff. You took fire
coming through the door.
Jeff smiles, gets in position so Alonzo can shoot him.

JEFF
Alright. Gonna get some time off.

He braces himself. Alonzo aims Roger's hand. Pop! A
BULLET THWACKS harmlessly into Jeff's VEST. He removes
his sunglasses from a pocket.

JEFF
Watch my shades.

Jake looking at Roger, it's hard to watch a man die.
Again Jeff braces. Pop! The THWACK of another BULLET.

ALONZO
How's that?

Jeff probing his hand under the vest.

JEFF
Fine.

Alonzo drops the gun in an envelope marked: EVIDENCE
HANDGUN. Jake can't believe what he just saw.

ALONZO
Listen up. This is the scenario.
Mark and Paul kick the door. Jeff
is first through. Roger opens
fire. Hits Jeff twice.
Jeff coughs -- bright foamy blood in his hand.

JEFF
Oh, shit.

ALONZO
One go through?

Jeff answers by coughing more blood. Tim runs to him.

(CONTINUED)
81.

55 CONTINUED: (3) 55

TIM
Siddown, dude.

Jeff does. Tim opens the vest -- a hole in a seam on the
edge. Underneath, bruised puckered flesh drools blood.

TIM
You shot him!

JEFF
You shot me!

TIM
Call a rescue.

ALONZO
You're fine. You'll get a medal.

JEFF
Call the R.A.!

ALONZO

Let me quarterback the goings on
and I will. Okay -- Mark and Paul
kick the door. First through is
Jeff. Bang. Bang. Gets hit.
Wounded. Second through is our
new guy, Hoyt. He drops the
suspect with some fine shotgun
work.

(points at Mark)
Who shot Roger?

MARK
The new guy. Came in spraying.
ALONZO
Paul?
PAUL
The boot shot him.
ALONZO
What'd you guys see?
TIM
Hoyt blasted him.
JEFF
Hoyt went for it -- Now will you

get me a damn rescue ambulance?

Jake looks at these guys. They look back, smiling,
smirking. He feels dizzy, sick as the nightmare sinks
in.

Jeff coughs blood. Alonzo tosses his rover to Paul.

PAUL
(into rover)
Eleven forty-nine. Nine-nine-
eight. Shots fired. Shots fired.
Officer down. Fifty-nine fifty-
one Baxter Street.

ALONZO
(slaps Jake's back)
Good job, son. Congratulations.
Gonna get a medal of valor.

JAKE
«+. I didn't shoot him...
ALONZO
Roomful of cops says you did.
JAKE
I don't care. I didn't shoot him.

You did.
Alonzo pulls his gun. Aims at Jake's face.

ALONZO

(as a newscaster)
A Los Angeles Police Department
narcotics officer was killed
serving a high risk warrant in
Echo Park today. An L.A.P.D.
spokesperson said the young
officer was survived by his wife
and infant child.

(himself)
Shit gets deeper. Get the
picture?

JAKE
I got the picture.

Jake strikes -- twists back Alonzo's gun sharply --
sweeps away his legs with a kick. Alonzo finds
himself on his back, Jake's knee on his neck,
staring down the maw of his own pistol.

(CONTINUED)
55

JAKE
That's the second time you've
stuck a gun in my face. Won't be
a third.

ALONZO
That's what I'm talking about.
You guys watching this? That's
it, Jake.

Paul presses his Beretta against Jake's temple.

PAUL
Be my pleasure putting a
hydrashock in your melon.

Tim, Jeff, Mark gawk at the Mexican standoff.

PAUL
But I'm gonna be cool. Open your
hand slowly. Drop the weapon.

Jake's free hand inches to his holstered gun --

JAKE
(super-calm)
Hey, sorry, man. Relax, okay?

-- and snatches it -- He swings on Tim -- who swings his
-45 on Jake. A three-way standoff.

JAKE
Wanna shoot me, Paul? Go ahead.
Because these two are gonna be
wiping my ass in the netherworld.

A beat. Then:

TIM
Alonzo. This is bad.

PAUL
This dude's a fed.

ALONZO
He's no fed. Just a choirboy with
heart who got the drop on you
fools. Everyone, let's take a
deep breath and defuse this --
Jake? You hear me?

JAKE
You can't just spring this shit on
me. I never signed up for this.

ALONZO

down your guns.

TIM
Hell no.

PAUL
Choirboy first.

SIRENS APPROACH. Lots of them.

ALONZO
Both of you: guns down. Now.

Paul and Tim reluctantly lower their weapons. Jake lifts
his knee off Alonzo's neck, stands and backs away, aiming
both pistols at Alonzo, who climbs to his feet.

ALONZO
Jake, use your ears and listen.
Sometimes we take shit all the
way. That's the nature of the
game. We don't do this every day.
No one will ever again ask you to
pull a trigger you don't want
to!-- Mark, where're you
transferring to?

MARK
Westside Homicide.

ALONZO
Westside Homicide -- Just made
detective. Jake, give me
eighteen months and I'll give
you a career. We make the big
arrests. We make the big
seizures. When someone's in my
unit they're in all the way or not
at all. I thought you were man
enough to handle this shit.

Alonzo calmly pours himself a glass of Roger's whisky.

ALONZO
Five proven, decorated officers
say you were the shooter.
Investigators are gonna pull a
tube of your blood and test for
intoxicants. Remember all the
P.C.P. you smoked today?

(CONTINUED)
55

CONTINUED: (7)
Jake does, wincing at his stupidity.

JAKE
You've been planning this all day.

ALONZO
I've been planning this all week.
You start talking crazy shit, I
will make sure your dirty blood
makes it to the lab. Still wanna
walk your babynuts around the
block? You won't make it to the
corner. But if you're cool.
You're a hero. A virgin shooter
above suspicion.

Jake looks at Roger, gasping like a beached carp. The
SIRENS are getting CLOSER.

Alonzo gulps his drink and!-- Pfffffst! Spits the booze
in Jake's face. Jake is blinded. Paul seizes Jake's
wrists and aims the pistols at the ceiling. Alonzo
wrenches the pistols from his hands. Jake wipes his
eyes, looks at the roomful of crazy cops, scared. Paul
points at Roger's other derringer, laying on the carpet.

PAUL
Alonzo, there's two shots in that
stinger. Let's kill your boy
right now and say Roger dumped him
coming through the door.

Mark, Tim, Jeff like the idea. Jake doesn't. And lucky
for him, neither does Alonzo, who stands protectively in
front of Jake.

ALONZO
No. We're not killing him. He's
a good guy. Man's got the magic.
Just having a little freakout is
all. We've all been there. I say
he's cool. No one's gonna hurt
him.

Jake and Alonzo trade a look. The SIRENS are close.

ALONZO
Hoyt, you gotta decision to make.
In ten seconds, this place will be
overrun with blue suits. Go
outside and clear your head.
(returns Jake's gun)
Or shoot me now.

Jake is only too happy to get out of there. Jake crosses

Crack! Jake nails his jaw. Paul staggers, almost falls.
To Jake as he exits:

PAUL
You're dead! I'm takin' you out.
I don't care.

ALONZO

Kick back, Wyatt Earp. Gotta
respect a cat who puts you on

Kid's got more balls than all you
faggots combined.

EXT. ROGER'S HOUSE - LONG SHOT - DAY 56

from a distant hilltop. The ambulances and black and
whites out front shimmer in golden afternoon heat. Two
distance-distorted LAPD paramedics wheel out Roger on a
stretcher.

ZOOM IN.

Amidst the heat mirages, Alonzo talks to a uniformed
sergeant. Two more paramedics wheel Jeff outside on a
stretcher. Mark, Tim and Paul following. Roger is
lifted into an ambulance. Alonzo dismisses Jeff's
paramedics and huddles with his men.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROGER'S HOUSE - ALLEY - DAY 57

Pops the trunk. Dumps everything inside. He shuts the

leaning against a phone pole. Watching as Alonzo pulls a

glasses. Alonzo begins writing a major incident report
as he talks on his cell. A beat. Alonzo STARTS the
G-RIDE. Motions for Jake to get in.

INT. G-RIDE (ROGER'S HOUSE - ALLEY) - DAY 58

Jake gets in, on the verge of freaking out. Alonzo with
his reading glasses, the clipboard on his steering wheel,
filling in the report, talking on his cell phone,
laughing.

ALONZO
-- you're gonna be scrubbing the
bathtub, homie. Later.

Alonzo hangs up. Preoccupied with filling in little
boxes on the report.

ALONZO
Why didn't you take off?

JAKE
There's nowhere to run.

ALONZO
Roger was D.O.A. at Good
Samaritan. Let's get the paper
rolling now.

Alonzo looks at Jake, sees his torment.

ALONZO
Justifiable homicide in the line
of duty. Anyone'd be proud to
have that in their jacket.

JAKE
Not this way. Say I don't play
along?

ALONZO

At this point it behooves you not
to dick around.

Jake has a lump in his throat. A beat of silence.

ALONZO
What happened today was --

JAKE

Wait. We had badges. It's
different.

ALONZO
Dammit, boy! Why can't you open
your eyes and see?

Jake can see. Too clearly. Softly:

JAKE
That man was your friend and you
killed him like a fly.

ALONZO

(laughs )
Friend? Because I drank his
whisky and he knew my name? Shit.
I was playing his ass. That's my
job. That's your job. Roger sold
dope to kids. World's better off
without him. He's the biggest major
violator in L.A. I've been watching
the cocksucker operate with impunity
for ten years. Now I got him.
This shit's chess not checkers.
Can't just slap cuffs on a cat
like that.

That's the truth. And Jake knows it.

ALONZO
Look, keep the money.

JAKE
Told you, I don't want it.

ALONZO
Just take it. Throw it in the
ocean. Barbecue it. Just take
it. It would make the boys feel
better.

JAKE
Fuck their feelings.

Jake stares out the window a beat, clenching his jaw.
He looks at dozens of birds sitting on the power
lines, backlit by the setting sun.

Jake finally looks at Alonzo, stares into Alonzo's scary,
empty eyes. Amazed to be utterly trapped by them. We
can almost hear Jake's heart breaking.

JAKE
It can't be like this.

A beat.

ALONZO
It is like this. I'm really sorry
I exposed you to all that. It was
ugly but it was necessary. Never
seen no one die before? Too damn
soft. Bet you never missed a meal
in your life.

JAKE
(glares at Alonzo)
Missed a lot meals growing up.
Why?
(pantomimes shooting up)
Because the folks had to do their
shit.

OFF Alonzo's amazed look:

JAKE
That's right. I'm in the cop
business to lock up the criminals,
the poisoners. Not to be one.

Alonzo sizes up Jake anew, laments not knowing that
earlier. He tries a different tack.

ALONZO
All the shit you're feeling now,
it's going to go away. I know
you're scared.

Jake, there's gotta be dirt on you
if anyone's gonna trust you.
After this is behind you, a whole
new life will open up. I walk a
higher path. I can give you the
keys to all doors.

JAKE
What are you talking about?

ALONZO
I'm not the asskicker I once was,
but you are. Want to run my unit?
My guys are good but not one of
those clowns is a leader. You
are. Want my job? You got it.
Wanna lock up criminals? This is
the best place to do it. Do your
time and make detective. Play the
game, grow wise and change things
from the inside.

Jake looks at him. And realizes Alonzo is right. Alonzo
STARTS the CAR, exits the alley.

Alonzo points out a well-tended, quiet, quaint house near
the cholos. Alonzo gets out. Opens the trunk. Loads up
his arms with appliances.

ALONZO
Sometimes I bring food. Believe

A drunk PeeWee maddogs Jake. Jake maddogs back.

PEEWEE
You know where you're at, fool?

A VETERANO shoves the PeeWee aside.

VETERANO
Outta the way, punk. It's

Alonzo knocks. A beat. A little girl cracks it.

ALONZO
Hi. Got some stuff for your
family.

She closes it. A beat. The door opens to reveal SMILEY,
a huge, drunk veterano sleeved with prison tattoos. He
looks at the two cops. Massive, impassive. Smiley never
smiles.

SMILEY
Kitchen's this way.

Alonzo enters. Jake hesitates. Then follows.

SNIPER and MORENO, big and intimidating like Smiley, have
been playing poker around a beer-bottle-covered table.

Smiley, Alonzo and Jake enter.

Moreno, ignore Alonzo. And vice versa.

JAKE'S POV

The box contains the bag of cash Jake refused.

DREAMER, 19, an attractive young lady, enters. Smiley
hands her the bag of Jake's money.

SMILEY
Count that shit in the bedroom.

DREAMER
Thanks, eh. I was doing stuff.
You learn to count, math whiz.

She gives him a dirty look and exits. Smiley takes his
seat and picks up his cards. He eyes Moreno.

SNIPER

Sniper finishes dealing. Jake looks at the cards
intended for him.

JAKE
Okay. One hand.

Jake sits. Now he can see a shotgun against the wall by
Moreno. The three cholos check their hands, signal for
more cards. Jake checks his cards.

MORENO
How long you been a cop?

Nineteen months.

Moreno shakes his head, points at Jake's waist.

MORENO

SNIPER
Your gun, dude. Let him see your
gun. Under your shirt.

Jake is outnumbered, outsized, outgunned. All he can do
is take the pistol from his holster and show Moreno.

MORENO
That's down. What is it? A three
eighty?

Three eighty stainless. Double

He hands it back. To Jake's relief. Jake looks down the
hall. Getting up:

JAKE
We have to go. I'm gonna get
Alonzo.

Kick back and party.

Smiley pulls aside the curtain.

Smiley slides the deck to Jake.

Okay. Thanks -- Gimme three.

Dreamer grabs a beer and exits. Jake deals three.

Moreno guffaws. Sniper chuckles.

Turns out the dude was somebody.
Alonzo's into the Rooskies for

that.

JAKE
How do you know?

Smiley gives Jake a look.

SMILEY
They gave Alonzo till today to
pay up. But his name's already
on a list. No one thought he
could get cash that big. Good
thing he got his blood money,
‘cause a crew's waiting on
standby. He don't get downtown
and pay up by midnight and not
a minute after, Cinderfella
turns into a corpse.

MORENO
It's all about punctuality, ese.

Jake tries to laugh. But it's getting weird.

Jake picks up the deck. Starts dealing. Smiley arranges

Looks of agreement are traded. Moreno grins at his

Hurry up, cop. Gimme three.

Jake reaches for the deck. This happens fast: Jake
flings the deck in Sniper's face. Smack! Cards scatter.

Jumps up from his chair, flips the table into Moreno.
Smiley SMASHES a beer BOTTLE on Jake's head. Moreno

She gives him the finger, pops out. Smiley pats Jake

SMILEY
You tripped, fool. You know that.

He finds Jake's handcuffs -- clicks his wrists together
behind his back. He takes his badge, clips it on his
belt.

SMILEY
Look. I'm acop. Gonna start
taxing.

Smiley commences kicking the hell out of Jake:

SMILEY

You're under arrest. For being a
cop. For being a buster. For
dogging me in the mouth in my own
pad. And for bleeding on my clean
kitchen floor. You have the right
to be kicked. And the right to be

grabs the shotgun from Moreno. Thumps the butt against
Jake's head, flips it, shoves the muzzle in his ear.
Snicks the shower curtain shut to catch the spatter.

SNIPER
Do it, eh.

SMILEY
It's gonna be loud. Close the

Moreno does. Sniper plugs his ears. Smiley braces for
the recoil. Jake is dazed, like steer ina
slaughterhouse chute.

MORENO
Wait. Lemme get his money first.

Smiley nods. Moreno searches Jake's pockets, takes his
wallet. Pockets forty bucks. Finds the Schoolgirl's
pink change purse. Opens it, reacts.

He hands it to Smiley.

The vato was tellin' the truth.
Life's a trip, huh?

The driver gives him a look, unties her shoe. Hands it to
Jake.

JAKE
Go straight to the Jungle. Stop
only when I say.

Cool. Jake jerks his head -- "Hurry up." He picked the
right driver; her sock-clad foot stomps the gas pedal.
The bus lurches forward.

The bus drives away under Jake's walking feet. He turns
and is scooped right into the back seat. Jake's ridden a
lot of busses.

EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT 74
Jake enters, wary. He rounds the misparked van. The

G-ride parked in a grassy lot. Jake glimpses the Little

Kid on the bike disappear down a driveway. Jake notes a
glowing cigarette on an apartment rooftop. Across the
street, Jake sees rooftop movement, as someone takes cover.
CLICK-CLACK as a rooftop shadow cocks a RIFLE.

Jake is on a mission, undeterred.

ON HOUSE

A porchlight turns off. The curtain moves in the window.

COUPLE G'S

kick it on a wall. Veteran soldiers ready for anything.

Jake continues toward Sara's building. Where a GANGSTER

unlocks the door. Jake enters quickly, grabs the boy and
hides him in a bookcase with little doors at the bottom.

Shhh. It's okay. Lay down.

The boy looking at Jake as he closes the door. Jake

Jake kicks it open.

Jake barges through the door, gun ready. Sara jumps

from the bed, clutching a sheet. Alonzo is dressed down,
ready for his important rendezvous. Finishing counting
and repacking Roger's money into a war bag of police gear.
Twenty-two pounds worth of Benjamin Franklin. Alonzo
spins, reacting as he recognizes the ghost before him.

He raises his hands, impressed. Unable to reach his gun
sitting on the dresser by his wallet.

JAKE
Smiley didn't want the job.

ALONZO
Goddamn, Jake. Lemme shake your
hand. You did it, you passed the
test. You a man now.

Alonzo offers his hand. Jake scoffs. Alonzo reaches for
the war bag. Real slow. He fishes a smoke from the pack
inside. Lights it.

ALONZO
Shit I've been through. Shit I've
seen. Took me a long time to get

Then hook and book me. For what?
You shot Roger when you were whacked
on P.C.P. and ran off like a maniac.
Got witnesses? Smiley? My squad?
My loyal troopers? Tell your tales.
We'll tell the truth. It's not

what you know, it's what you can
prove. Where's your evidence, Jake?

JAKE
There's my evidence.

Jake nods at the cash. THWACK! Alonzo flicks his
cigarette at Jake's face. A blinding explosion of SPARKS.
Alonzo dives over the bed, grabbing the war bag of cash.
In a rack under the bed is a sawed-off, pump SHOTGUN.
Alonzo jerks the trigger -- BOOM! -- PELLETS SIZZLE past
Jake's feet as he dives out of the room.

Jake must act. He scrambles to his feet, exposing himself.

Alonzo seizes the moment to depart, dropping the empty
shotgun and disappearing into the bedroom.

Alonzo's silhouette running along the treacherous
rooftop, takes cover alongside a pigeon coop covered
with elaborate graffiti. Alonzo FIRES at Jake.

Jake drops, rolls and FIRES back blindly. Alonzo runs
for the adjacent roof.

Alonzo jumps onto a balcony.

Jake runs at full tilt. Toward the edge of the roof.
Where nasty coils of razor-wire lay in wait.

Jake jumps -- His foot hits rotten plywood -- Jake flies
awkwardly through space.

EXT. OTHER ROOFTOP - NIGHT 80

Another pigeon coop. Chairs, a card table, potted

plants; a little oasis. The edge of the roof approaching
fast, and its concertina of razor-wire. Jake's chest hits
it -- oof! An iron spike atop a fence a mere inch from
his ear. Jake pulls himself onto the roof.

Smack! Alonzo nails Jake's face with the war bag of
cash.

Jake is stunned, Alonzo grabs the gun tied to Jake's hand
and both hit the deck. They wrestle as Alonzo gets a
finger in the trigger guard -- POP-POP-POP-CLICK!
Emptying Jake's PISTOL.

Using his gun as brass knuckles, Jake punches Alonzo's
head. Alonzo head-butts Jake, knees him in the crotch.
Jake gasps in agony.

Alonzo stands, begins stomping Jake's head. Jake rolls
out of the way. Alonzo kicking. Jake rolling...

Right off the edge of the roof.

Jake falls a story to -- THUD! -- a roof below.

Alonzo looks down at Jake. Who looks half-dead. Alonzo
looks at his watch -- he has 25 minutes. Alonzo spits on

Jake and moves on. Alonzo crosses to a stairwell and

tries to pull himself up, but the sheet metal wiper bends
back on itself.

JAKE'S FEET

drag along the street. RUBBER GRINDING off his heels.

INSERT - WIPER

It cuts Jake's hand, now slick with blood. Stress cracks
in the sheet metal. The METAL TEARS...

BACK TO SCENE

The wiper snaps off. With three desperate fingers, Jake
grabs the window stanchion, pulls himself back onto the
windshield, his bloody face pressed against the glass,
crimson streaks cascade down.

Jake begins whipping Alonzo with the wiper in his left
hand. Pffck! Pffck! Opens a gash on Alonzo's face as
he backs down the street.

Alonzo presses a button and a GUN slides out of the dash,
Alonzo grabs it, presses the muzzle against the glass
where Jake's face is. Jake jerks his head -- BAM! A
near miss.

BAM! Another hole in the glass. But fortunately not
Jake's head.

WHAM! The G-RIDE backs into a car. The gun flies from
Alonzo's hand, out the window. Jake tumbles off the car
onto the street. The G-ride stalls. It didn't get far
at all. Alonzo is pretty beat up from the crash. Jake
scrambles for the gun, then leans in the window of the G-
ride and punches Alonzo several times. Jake grabs the
war bag, pulls open the door and yanks Alonzo out onto
the street, Jake backs up, sets the war bag at his feet.

The porch lights of two houses come on. Steel doors
open. People tentatively step outside. Women and
children, mothers with babies on their hips. Blue-collar
fathers in shop uniforms. The Old Woman appears with two
pretty girls. More porch lights come on.

A dozen gangsters boil out of a driveway like angry

To Alonzo's astonishment, no one moves. He's on his own.

at his side.

JAKE
They're not like you. Know what
I learned today? I'm not like you.

ALONZO
Good. Now what? Gonna kill me?
Gonna break your cherry with a

Ain't easy. Do it clean, right

Alonzo taps his forehead as he takes a step toward Jake.

Alonzo looks diminished, broken.

Jake's eyes fall to the badge around Alonzo's neck. He
smirks at the irony. Then yanks the badge from Alonzo's
neck.

JAKE
You don't deserve this.

Jake looks at the gangsters, their faces, the faces of
the people around him. He sees satisfaction. Hears
murmurs of approval. Jake meets the Bench Presser's
gaze, who leans against the G-ride. Pulls a beer from
his pocket and cracks it.

BENCH PRESSER
Better get on outta here.

The Bench Presser gives Jake a slight nod of respect and
Jake leaves. Alonzo watches Jake go in outraged amazement.
Alonzo moves to follow Jake and gets the Bench Presser's
gun in his face. The crowd surrounding the G-ride drifts
away. People return home.

ALONZO
That's right. That's right. I'll
burn this down. Take it all down.
Walk away. See what happens.

No one listens. Alonzo has been abandoned save for the
gangsters guarding him. He despairs in his defeat.

ON JAKE

walking away, the money in hand, his innocence gone.
Though there is a heavy burden on his shoulders, there
is much strength in his gait.

CUT TO:

EXT. SEPULVEDA BOULEVARD - NIGHT 83

The G-ride barrels west toward LAX. A 747 in the landing
pattern overtakes it, its ENGINES HOWL as it descends.

INT. G-RIDE (STREET NEAR LAX) - MOVING - NIGHT 84

Alonzo tears open the head liner, exposing a Glock duct-
taped inside the roof. He lays the weapon on the seat
next to him, where a ROVER plays routine POLICE CHATTER.
Alonzo tears back the head liner more, finds a manila
envelope, dumps it on the seat -- there's plane tickets,
cash, pesos, passports, travelers' checks, IDs, apartment
keys. His getaway kit.

A red light ahead. Light cross traffic. Alonzo notes
headlights following him. Stops at the light. He takes
a pull on a pint of vodka. Wipes his lips with a shaky
hand.

A van pulls into the intersection to make a left. Too
far into the intersection. Alonzo eyes it, wary.

The headlights pull up behind him -- another VAN --
SCREECHING to a stop at an angle, blocking him. The side
doors on both vans slide open. Gun steel glimmers.

This is it. It's going down. Alonzo reaches for his
Glock. Hesitates. It's over. Alonzo lifts his chin
and braces for what is coming...

BRRRDDDDDDDT! Two men in each van open FIRE with heavy
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS -- AKs and HK-9ls. Muzzle flashes
strobe across bandanna-covered faces and shiny eyes.
These pros know their weapons.

BULLETS PUNCH into Alonzo, the G-Ride. Passing straight
through the car, SHATTERING GLASS. Shattering Alonzo.

After forever, the weapons are empty. Gun smoke wafts
through the intersection. Alonzo, his beloved G-ride,

are shredded. Alonzo leans forward, his head hits the

HORN.

The DOORS of the vans SNAP SHUT. The vans take off in
different directions.

FOOM! A small FIRE STARTS under the G-ride, leaking fuel
and fluids. The flames spread, the interior burns.

CLOSE ON FINGERS OF FIRE

as they probe out from the bullet holes.

CUT TO:

INT. JAKE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 85

Jake slowly approaches his house.

HIS POV

In his driveway is a plush unmarked police sedan.

BACK TO SCENE

Jake grabs his service nine from his duffle. He parks
and gets out.

CUT TO:

EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 86
Jake shoves the nine in his waistband and crosses to the
sedan. Lou, Doug and Stan exit the car. They've been
waiting.

STAN
Where's the money, Jake?

JAKE
The evidence room at headquarters.

Jake slaps Alonzo's badge on the trunk.

STAN
That's not necessary.

JAKE
That's not mine.

Doug picks up Alonzo's badge, impressed, pockets it.
Before Doug can say anything.

JAKE
Now leave me the hell alone.

With the last of his strength, a battered and mauled Jake
limps away. The three wise men climb in their car. The
plush sedan backs out of Jake's driveway. Jake enters
his house.

PULL BACK.

Jake's home becomes indistinguishable in a sea of houses.

FADE OUT:

THE END
