CO shaped swimming pool... move in on him ...He wears orange
trunks, green flip-flops, gold rings,heavy gold chains, big

(that’s deeply!) tanned and heavily oiled with pungent |
Hawaiian tropic suntan lotion ... this is GAL DOVE ... aged i
49 ... half a dozen empty San Miguel bottles beside him ...
he basks ... intermittently we hear the sound of
unenthusiastic brushing from nearby ...

GAL lazily reaches down to a bowl of iced water and extracts
a white flannel ... lightly wrings it ... carefully folds it
into a rectangle and gently lays it on his crotch ... pats it
| ... Closes his eyes and sighs ...

 

ENRIQUE, grudgingly brushing, muttering obscenities under his
breath in Spanish ...

 

GAL {cont’d)

(Eyes closed.Smiling)
What's that? ... You slaggin’ me off? ...
