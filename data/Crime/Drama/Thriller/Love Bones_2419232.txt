INT. SALMON HOUSE - DAY (WINTER 1963) 1

CLOSE ON: The BLURRED IMAGE of a WORLD, distorted by a wall of
CLEAR PLASTIC ...

CAMERA is INSIDE a small SNOW GLOBE, looking out ... as we
glimpse PEOPLE moving about in the room beyond. They only come
nto FOCUS when they get CLOSE.

SUSIE (V.0.)
I remember being really small, too
small to see over the edge of a table.

CHUBBY, LITTLE FINGERS grope towards the OBJECT ... a 4 year old
SUSIE SALMON comes into FOCUS clutching at the SNOW GLOBE ... a
YOUNG FATHER, JACK SALMON, looks on -over his daughter's
shoulder. I Dream of Jeannie plays on TV in the BACKGROUND.

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
There was a snow globe ...

CLOSE ON: SUSIE, captivated by a PLASTIC PENGUIN wearing a red
and white striped scarf around it’s neck ...large in the
FOREGROUND.

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
And I remember the penguin who lived
inside the globe. He was all alone in
there and I worried for him...

JACK takes hold of the GLOBE and flicks it. SNOW FLAKES FALL ...
streaming towards the CAMERA ... tumbling down the PENGUIN’S
FACE.

THROUGH the PLASTIC we see the distorted image of SUSIE and JACK
watching the FAKE SNOW fall gently around the PENGUIN.

ANGLE ON: The YOUNGER JACK looks in to LITTLE SUSIE'S eyes.
JACK
Don’t worry, kiddo he has a nice life
- he’s trapped in a perfect world.
TITLE CREDIT SEQUENCE ...
MONTAGE:0N THE SOUNDTRACK Reelin’in the Years by Steely Dan

YEARS PASS ... our view from WITHIN the SNOW GLOBE shows it being
moved from room to room; fashions change, people grow older.

IMAGES of FAMILY PHOTOS are glimpsed from our distorted view
inside the SNOW GLOBE ... WEDDING PHOTOS and BABY PICTURES tell
the story of a young FAMILY growing up.

VIEW from inside the GLOBE which is now discarded on the FLOOR
... HOLIDAY, the family DOG, sniffs at it.

The GLOBE is suddenly picked UP and dropped into a CARDBOARD BOX
++. carried UPSTAIRS, plunged into a DARK CUPBOARD.

MONTAGE: JACK, now several years OLDER, reaches into the BOX and
takes the SNOW GLOBE, regarding it like an old friend.
2.

He is now decorating his STUDY He finds the perfect spot on a
SHELF ... a BABY crawls on the FLOOR by his feet ...

IMAGE: JACK gives the GLOBE a SHAKE ... swirling snowflakes fill
the screen ...

EXT. SALMON STREET - DAY (WINTER 1971) 2

REAL FLAKES swirl around a quiet SUBURBAN STREET bathed in a SNOW
DRIFT.

INT. SUSIE’S BEDROOM - DAY (SUMMER 1973) 3

SUN shines through the LACE CURTAINS to reveal the SNOW GLOBE
sitting half buried in the debris of makeup, jewelry, trinket
boxes, badges and gum which litter SUSIE SALMON’S DRESSING TABLE.

++. she is now 14 YEARS OLD, painting her TOENAILS with Magenta
Glitter nail polish and listening to her RADIO playing a 70‘s
song.

CLOSE ON: SUSIE flicking pages of Seventeen magazine in a bedroom
plastered with pin-up images of teen idol DAVID CASSIDY ... the
BAY CITY ROLLERS ... BREAD ...

EXT. SALMON GARDEN - DAY 4

ANGLE ON: BUCKLEY and NATE, two five year old BOYS, are playing
in the GARDEN. BUCKLEY is SUSIE’S YOUNGER BROTHER and NATE is his
PRIEND.

CLOSE ON: NATE attempting to insert a twig up his nose.

BUCKLEY
I know! I know! Watch me!

BUCKLEY jams a twig in his mouth and puffs on the pretend
cigarette, prancing about showing off.

INT. SUSIE’S BEDROOM - DAY 5

SUSIE flips the PAGE of Seventeen as she dips the NAILBRUSH in
the bottle. She suddenly freezes - a FLY is stuck on the
NAILBRUSH. SUSIE is about to flick it off, but slowly lifts it up
to her face ... drawn to the FLY’S EYES.

SUSIE reaches for her INSTAMATIC CAMERA and snaps a photo of the
PL

SOUND ... LOW, building BUZZ of FLY ... SONG runs out on SUSIE'S
CASSETTE PLAYER, replaced with the HUM of STATIC which all but
obliterate‘s NATE’‘S DISTANT VOICE, calling for SUSIE.

SUDDENLY ... the plastic cassette players BUTTON pops up with an
overly loud THUNK! It pulls SUSIE back to reality.

NATE (0.S.)
(panicked)
Help! Somebody!
SUSIE flicks the FLY away.

NATE (CONT'D)
HELP!!!!

SUSIE slams the WINDOW up and looks aghast ...

CLOSE ON: BUCKLEY choking on the GROUND his body bucking and
writhing ... the TWIG stuck down his THROAT.

INT. SALMON HOUSE - DAY 6
ANGLES ON: SUSIE races down the stairs, screaming for her family.

INSERTS: SMILING PHOTOS of her MOM and DAD ... GRANDPARENTS ...
GRANDMA LYNN ... BABY PHOTOS ...

SUSIE
(yelling)
Mom! Dad!

The HOUSE is SILENT and EMPTY.

EXT. SALMON BACKYARD - DAY 7

ANGLE ON: SUSIE blasts through the back door. Jumps a dog fence
and scoops BUCKLEY into her ARMS - he is in spasm.

SUSIE
(panicked)
Buckley!
(to NATE)
What happened?

NATE
(pale and frightened)
He swallowed a twig.

ANGLES ON: GARAGE DOOR OPENS revealing a classic MUSTANG CAR ...
SUSIE throws BUCKLEY into the BACKSEAT ... terra-cotta POTS smash
on the garage FLOOR, as SUSIE snatches up her DAD’S KEYS from
their hiding place.

EXT. NORRISTOWN STREETS - DAY 8

ANGLE ON: The MUSTANG roars off down SUSIE’S STREET - with her
behind the WHEEL! She glances back at BUCKLEY, lolling
UNCONSCIOUS on the BACKSEAT. SUSIE stabs her FOOT at the
ACCELERATOR PEDAL, lurching the CAR forward in a series of angry

ANGLE ON: SUSIE‘S MUSTANG pulls out into the TRAFFIC of a MAIN
ROAD, SUSIE barely VISIBLE above the DASHBOARD. She clips a ROAD
SIGN, sending it spinning - it’s the SIGN to the LOCAL HOSPITAL.

SUSIE’S not so much driving the car, but aiming it at the
HOSPITAL and hoping for the best!
 

ANGLE ON: A COUPLE have to SWERVE their car out of SUSIE’S WAY to
avoid being hit ... SUSIE’S PARENTS, JACK and ABIGAIL SALMON, sit
looking shocked behind the wheel!

JACK
My Car! Was that my car?

JACK speeds off after the MUSTANG!

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 9

CAMERA DRIFTS over a SEA of SHEETS, seeming to stretch endlessly.
HAZY DISTANT FIGURES, out of FOCUS, hovering at the END of an
EXPANSIVE BED.

ANGLE ON: BUCKLEY'S SLEEPING FACE ... his EYELIDS flutter open
.». BUCKLEY stares dazed at his family.

ANGLE ON: LOW, across the HOSPITAL BED, as the VAST DISTANCE
seems to SHRINK ... FIGURES glide closer ... we recognize
LINDSEY, in tee-shirt and track pants ... JACK, SUSIE ... GRANDMA
LYNN and finally ABIGAIL in a CREAM COLOURED SMOCK leans into
SHOT, huge in the FOREGROUND. TEARS of RELIEF, as she hugs her
son BUCKLEY. It’s as if BUCKLEY has returned from the dead.

This is the worst trial this family has ever faced. ABIGAIL and
JACK are consumed with GUILT.

JACK wraps an arm around ABIGAIL’S shoulders.

JACK
(softly)
He‘s alright ... he’s okay.

SHOT SETTLES: on SUSIE and GRANDMA LYNN who are standing near the
back of the ROOM.

GRANDMA LYNN
(low)
I told her. I warned her ... it was a
disaster waiting to happen.

SUSIE
Buckley’s gonna be fine, Grandma.

GRANDMA LYNN
Buckley? I was referring to your
Mother’s passion for polyester.
That's not a frock - it’s a catering
tent

ANGLE ON: JACK and ABIGAIL in the DOCTOR’S OPPICE ... he is
giving them a stern REBUKE - barely audible as the CAMERA glides
past ...

Buckl avery luck:

juckley’s a very lucky boy. If your
daughter hadn’t been there, you"
would’ve lost him.

JACK
Well, I suppose it is - technically
speaking.

As we move into the thick of the party the CAMERA assumes a
slightly more uneasy POV ...

MR. STEAD turns away from CAMERA as it approaches ...

JOB ELLIS, a surly teenager, sneers contemptuously and hurls a
rock which flies wide of his target - a tin can perched on a
fence.

CLOSE ON: MR. TARKING’S EYES shift past a TABLE laden with FOOD.

ANGLE ON: TESSA GILBERT, a young girl around 7 years old, skips
through a plastic HOOP.

ANGLE ON: ABIGAIL SALMON supervising BUCKLEY, who staggers under
the weight of a tray of COOKIES ...

ABIGAIL
Hello Tessa. Would you like a cookie?

TESSA takes a COOKIE from BUCKLEY’S TRAY.

ANGLE ON: MRS. TARKING and MRS. GILBERT in full flight as MRS.
TARKING rapidly devours a BUNDT CAKE.

MRS. TARKING
(mouth full)
The apple pie was overly moist, but
her bundt cakes are really quite
bearable.

BUCKLEY thumps the TRAY of COOKIES down on the table.

MRS. GILBERT
Abigail, is that the smell of home
cooking?

ABIGAIL

I made them this morning.
MRS. GILBERT elbows MRS. TARKING in the ribs.

MRS. GILBERT
And you said she’d bring Ritz
Crackers and Easy Cheese.

MRS. TARKING scowls. GRACE TARKING, her DAUGHTER, a heavy set
girl with braces, swoops in on the table.

MRS. TARKING
Grace, dear - leave some for others.

GRACE stomps off in a HUFF.
ABIGAIL

(sweetly)
Is Grace still taking ballet lessons?
11

JOE ELLIS scores a direct HIT, knocking the tin over ... a
terrified KITTEN jumps out!

CLOSE ON: MR. GILBERT - his gaze lights upon GRACE TARKING, as he
chats with MR. HARVEY, an unremarkable looking 36 year old man.

MR. HARVEY
Egg shells. Best fertilizer, bar
none.

MR. HARVEY gestures towards his immaculate GARDEN, festooned with
RED GERANIUMS, just as JACK appears with a TRAY of DRINKS.

JACK
Must get a bit ripe in the
summertime!

MR. HARVEY
My wife Sophie, put me on to them.

JACK
Well, I can’t argue with the results.

MR. HARVEY'S SMILE fades ...

MR. HARVEY
We bought this place just before she
was diagnosed.

SUSIE
pad! (calling)

CLOSE ON: JACK looking concerned.

MR. HARVEY
I lost her to cancer.

JACK
Oh, I’m sorry.

SUSIE
Hey! Dad! Look at me!

IMAGE: RED GERANIUMS on MR. HARVEY‘S HEDGE in the FOREGROUND ...
in the background out of focus SUSIE cavorts on her bike ...
while HOLIDAY barks and runs in circles.

INT. SALMON KITCHEN - NIGHT 11

ANGLE ON: ABIGAIL serving up dinner ... she puts plates of
steaming food in front of BUCKLEY and LINDSEY who are seated at
the dining table.

ABIGAIL
, (calling)
Susie! Jack! Dinner’s ready!
12 INT. JACK’S STUDY - NIGHT 12

ANGLE ON: JACK and SUSIE huddled over a BOTTLE on his WORK DESK
--. we drift past FOREGROUND SAILING SHIPS, peering through
MASTS, SAILS and RIGGING. JACK looks up as ABIGAIL’S voice
resounds upstairs.

SUSIE
We've gotta finish it - Mom won't
mind if dinner gets cold.

JACK
Yes, she will.
(squinting into the bottle)
++. hold it steady.

SUSIE slowly pulls a tiny piece of THREAD between her fingers.

JACK (CONT'D)
You kids take your mother far too
much for granted.

SUSIE
I just think there’s more to life
than cooking and cleaning.

JACK
This may surprise you, but your
mother does too. I remember when she
decided to go to California ...

SUSIE
She never told me about that!

JACK
She never went.

CLOSE ON: JACK gently waves a BURNING CANDLE under the THREAD to
tighten it.

SUSIE
Why not?

JACK
Because you came along.

ANGLE ON: SUSIE looking surprised.

JACK (CONT'D)
Okay, shipmate ...

CLOSE ON: Inside the bottle the BOW of the SHIP slides into view.

JACK (CONT’D)
Take it away!

CLOSE ON: SUSIE gently pulls the thread out of the BOTTLE’S NECK
+++ the MASTS RISE on a tiny SHIP in the BOTTLE. Sails unfurl,
revealing a delicate CLIPPER SHIP.

JACK (CONT'D)
(blowing out the candle)
Now that is a thing of beauty!

SUSIE watches her DAD proudly place the ship on a SHELF, among
MANY OTHERS.

INT. SALMON HOUSE/SUSIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 13

ANGLE ON: SUSIE is in BED reading ... ABIGAIL crosses to the
WINDOW and closes the CURTAINS.

EXT. SUSIE’S STREET - NIGHT 14

THE CAMERA DRIFTS away from SUSIE‘S BEDROOM ... down the STREET
+++. across NEIGHBOURING ROOFTOPS ... travelling down towards a
HOUSE at the end of the STREET ... a HOUSE exactly like any other
in this NEIGHBOURHOOD - except it is PALE GREEN and has a
slightly neater LAWN, and slightly cleaner paint work, and RED
GERANIUMS are blooming in the slightly nicer garden.

INT. MR. HARVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 15

ANGLE ON: CAMERA DRIFTS past the FRONT of a MOONLIT HOUSE - neat
and tidy, with FLOWERS PAINTED on the WALLS. We think it’s real
at first, but soon REALISE that we're looking at a model ... an
intricately constructed DOLLSHOUSE.

On the SOUNDTRACK: The Great Pretender by Brian Eno

As the CAMERA rises above the roof of the DOLLSHOUSE, we see the
hunched FIGURE of a MAN; a shadowy giant, grotesquely out of
proportion with his small scale surroundings, working intently
with plywood and glue.

There are 4 or 5 more DOLLSHOUSE in various states of completion
lined up in a row on the LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

An ALARM CLOCK RINGS! Through a window of the DOLLSHOUSE, we
watch the MAN rise - as if compelled by the ALARM - to pull the
inds °

CLOSE ON: Neatly painted flowering vines rise from miniature
flower boxes up the weatherboard wall of the miniature house.

CLOSE ON: A PAINT BRUSH painting more FLOWERS on the WEATHERBOARD
WALL but these ones are CLUMSY and CRUDE LOOKING ... there is a
faint but continuous TREMOR in the HAND that is holding the

ANOTHER ALARM RINGS! The MAN rises, takes four paces to the left,
and without looking - flicks off the LIGHTS.

INT. MR. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 16

ANGLE ON: The figure of the MAN, alone in BED ... consumed with
thoughts which won‘t let him sleep.

10.

THE LIGHT SNAPS ON.

CLOSE ON: MR. HARVEY, in SINGLET and BOXER SHORTS, sitting ina
BRIGHT POOL of LIGHT. It is the first time we have seen him since
the block party ... an IDEA is forming in his mind.

CLOSE ON: MR. HARVEY grabs a SKETCH PAD from his bedside table.

EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT 17

ANGLE ON: A CLASSIC WIDE of a FULL GROWN CORNFIELD laid out in
the MOONLIGHT. The CAMERA starts to DESCEND, sinking down into
the CORNSTALKS ... DISAPPEARING into the BLACKNESS of the GROUND,
which now appears as CROSS-SECTIONED GROUND - like a large ant
farm.

INT. MR. HARVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 18

DARK EARTH fills the SCREEN... DISSOLVING over: quick, nervous
pencil lines ... a drawing of a small UNDERGROUND CHAMBER begins
to take shape. The EARTH DISSOLVES completely away ... leaving MR
HARVEY’S pencil sketch, stark lines on white paper.

ANGLE ON: MR. HARVEY sits on the edge of his bed in BOXERS, bare
legs hang ... the NOTEBOOK on his LAP.

CLOSE ON: MR. HARVEY, tense and grin ++. trying to maintain his
concentration against an internal FLOOD of SOUND:

REPRISE: SOUNDS from the BLOCK PARTY: A BICYCLE BELL RINGS ... A
PENCIL DRAWS A LINE ... SUSIE’S LAUGHTER ... MORE LINES ON PAPER
WHICH BECOME: A SKETCH of SOME STAIRS ... HOLIDAY BARKING ...
BIKE TIRES skidding to a halt on the ROAD ... SUSIE'S FINGERS
wrap around the HANDLE BARS + THE SOUNDS resound in MR.

HAR\ *S HEAD: BICYCLE BELL ... BARKING ... SUSIE’S LAUGHTER ...

CLOSE ON: MR. HARVEY'S stabbing pencil writes the dimensions: "6
foot by 8 foot”

 

EXT. BLOCK PARTY REPRISE - DAY 19

IMAGE: MR. HARVEY talking at the BLOCK PARTY ... in his GLASSES a
reflection of SUSIE turning circles on her bike.

SUSIE
Look at me!

SOUNDS MUFFLE into BLOCK PARTY BABBLE ...

CLOSE ON: MR. HARVEY - IMAGES of SUSIE play in his GLASSES like a
voyeuristic MOVIE SCREEN ... her LAUGHTER is now all he hears.
EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT 20

CLOSE ON: The CORNFIELD ... BUGS, flying, darting, crawling - a
thriving, busy ecosystem.
21

22

ll.

CLOSE ON: A WASP attacks a MOSQUITO ... they roll on the GROUND
in a DEATH GRIP.

SUDDENLY! A TRAPDOOR SPIDER springs out of the GROUND, grabbing
both the WASP and MOSQUITO, dragging them underground, the
earthen lid of his lair slamming SILENTLY SHUT.

EXT. SALMON GARDEN - DAY (AUTUMN 1973) 21

CLICK! SUSIE is trying to get a PERFECT PHOTO of HOLIDAY ... but
every time she takes a photo - he MOVES his head.

ANGLE ON: ABIGAIL, unaware of SUSIE, comes out and sits on the
BACK STEP, her morning coffee in hand.

CLICK! SUSIE automatically snaps off a photograph of her mother.
CLOSE ON: ABIGAIL: quiet, reflective ... lost in thought.
ANGLE ON: JACK hurries towards his car, briefcase in hand.
ABIGAIL looks up ... CLICK!
As JACK bends down to kiss her on the CHEEK.
CLICK! SUSIE takes one last photo of ABIGAIL as JACK drives away
«+. CLICK! Nothing ... SUSIE’S FILM has run out.
INT. SUSIE’S BEDROOM - DAY 22
SUSIE arrives in her BEDROOM, pulling the CARTRIDGE out of her
CAMERA, appalled to find LINDSEY flipping through her SCHOOL YEAR
BOOK.
SUSIE
Hey! That’s private!

SUSIE tries to snatch back her YEARBOOK, but LINDSEY deftly
sidesteps her.

LINDSEY
I let you read mine!

SUSIE
Give it back!

LINDSEY
What is the big deal? It's only a
stupid year book.
LINDSAY opens the book and reads aloud ...
LINDSEY (CONT'D
“My greatest personal achievement is:
beating Dad at chess...”
LINDSEY pulls a FACE ...

SUSIE
You are so going to regret this!
~~

23

12.

LINDSEY
“My life long ambition is: to be a
wild life photographer.” Boring!

SUSIE lunges for the book again, as LINDSEY darts away.

LINDSEY (CONT’D)
Now for the juicy stuff ...
(reading )
“My heart belongs to ...”

SUSIE snatches the BOOK and SLAMS it shut!

INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY 23

ANGLE ON: RAY SINGH, shopping with his PARENTS. His FATHER is an
academic, and his MOTHER wears a traditional INDIAN SARI. Of
INDIAN DESCENDANT this family stands out among the other
SHOPPERS.

SUSIE (V.0.)
His name was Ray Singh. He came from
England and he was eight hundred
times smarter than anyone else in my
class.

ANGLE ON: SUSIE, in a LIGHTING STORE with her GRANDMA, watches
the SINGH FAMILY from behind a CANDELABRA.

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Plus - he was cool. Not like some
lame-brain sports jock who thought he
was cool when he wasn’t. Ray was
different...

ANGLE ON: RAY turns and looks back at SUSIE.

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
He was nice ...

GRANDMA LYNN
Who's that?

ANGLE ON: SUSIE looks up at her GRANDMOTHER. They are seated at a
table in the FOODHALL, eating takeaway food. A SALAD for LYNN and
a BURGER for SUSIE.

SUSIE
Who's what?

GRANDMA LYNN
Who is the boy you can’t take your
eyes off?

SUSIE blushes ...
GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)

Does he like you as much as you like
him?
13.

SUSIE
I don’t know?! ... Maybe.

GRANDMA LYNN
Then what’s the hold up?

SUSIE looks away, embarrassed.

SUSIE
I’m just not sure I‘11 be any good at
it.

GRANDMA LYNN frowns ...

GRANDMA LYNN
(realising)
Ah, the kiss question! You’re quite
right - it’s a serious business. Your
first kiss is destiny knocking.

SUSIE watches as GRANDMA LYNN snaps open a powder compact and
reapplies another coat of lipstick.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
If I had it to do over again I would
have worn something stupendous - like
Fire and Ice! But Revlon didn’t make
that lipstick back then. I would have
left my mark on the man.

GRANDMA LYNN smacks her lips.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT'D)
See Susie, if you kiss like a lemon ...

SUSIE
You make lemonade.

GRANDMA LYNN
Precisely.

GRANDMA LYNN leans closer ...

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
Can you keep a secret? My first kiss
came from a grown man. The father of
a school friend.

SUSIE
(shocked)
Grandma!

GRANDMA LYNN
You're not going to tell on me, are
you?

SUSIE
Course not.

GRANDMA LYNN
I knew it wasn’t ‘allowed’ but boys
my own age, I just couldn’t tolerate!

14.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT'D)
I can't describe it Susie but those
few seconds with Mr. McGahern ... Now
there was a man who knew how to kiss!

SUSIE
But ... what about Grandad?

GRANDMA LYNN
Not much of a kisser. After we got
married I thought that with practice
he might improve, but he never did.

ANGLE ON: SUSIE looking distracted and anxious. GRANDMA LYNN pats
her on the ARM.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
Susie ... just have fun kid.

EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY (EARLY WINTER 1973) 24

We rise past short CHOPPED STUMPS of a HARVESTED CORNFIELD, to
see the SALMON FAMILY CAR driving past.

SUSIE & LINDSEY (0.S.)
(singing)
Stones and Bones; Snow and frost;
Seeds and beans and polliwogs.

INT. SALMON FAMILY CAR - DAY 25

ANGLE ON: JACK driving SUSIE, LINDSEY and BUCKLEY seated in the
back of the FAMILY CAR.

SUSIE and LINDSEY are singing at the top of their lungs!

SUSIE & LINDSEY
(singing)
Paths and twigs, assorted kisses,
We all know who Daddy misses ...

CLOSE ON: JACK smiles at them in the rear-view mirror.

JACK
(singing in answer)
His two little frogs of girls, that’s
who ... They know who they are ... do
you? Do you?

EXT. RUTH‘S HOUSE - DAY 26

WIDE ON: The SALMON FAMILY CAR pulls off the ROAD and goes up a
narrow DRIVE towards an old HOUSE perched on a small field.

BUCKLEY (0.S.)
(chanting)
Sinkhole! Sinkhole!
15.

CAMERA CRANES UP past old CAR WRECKS and other debris: to reveal
a LARGE SINKHOLE that has spread across the backyard of the
property. With crumbling sides, and a gaping dark center, it’s
impossible to see how deep it is.

BUCKLEY leaps out of the CAR and hurries towards the SINKHOLE!

JACK
(alarmed)
Buckley! No! ... Susie!

SUSIE quickly stops her little brother short of the edge ... both
stare into the JUNK-FILLED ABYSS.

BUCKLEY
I want to see the tiny people!

SUSIE
Shhh! If you make too much noise they
won’t come out.

THUD! JACK tips an OLD FRIDGE out of the back of the car, and
starts to push it toward the SINKHOLE.

BUCKLEY
{loud whisper)
But where is the village?

SUSIE
It’s right at the bottom. There’s an
entire race of really small repairmen
who love fixing things. They ‘re gonna
greet our old refrigerator like it’s
a gift from heaven!

A LARGE MAN in DIRTY OVERALLS approaches them. This is MR.
CONNORS.

JACK
You might want to think about
investing in a fence.

MR. CONNORS
They don’t respond to fences.

A MANGY DOG is manically scratching it’s back on the underside of
an old CAR WRECK.

MR. CONNORS (CONT'D)
In ten years it’s swallowed half the
property.
(to BUCKLEY)
That's why we call it The Beast!

CLOSE ON: BUCKLEY squeezes SUSIE’S HAND.
MR. CONNORS takes SWIG of WHISKEY from a FLASK ...

MR. CONNORS (CONT'D)
It’s sneaky, see?
27

28

16.

JACK
Sneaky?

MR. CONNORS
Course it is. Comes with the
territory.

JACK
Pardon me?

MR. CONNORS
I’m not stupid.
(lowering his voice)
One of these days I’m gonna dump ten
ton of concrete down it’s craw - seal
the sucker up for good.
ANGLE ON: MR. CONNORS helps JACK heave the FRIDGE into the ABYSS
of the SINKHOLE ... it tumbles into DARKNESS.
INT. RUTH’S SHED - DAY 27
ANGLE ON: JACK and MR. CONNORS, seen through a COBWEB covered
half-broken WINDOW ... JACK fishes in his pocket pulls out a
check book.
MR. CONNORS
No checks... In God we trust -
everybody else pays cash.
A CLOUD OF SMOKE floats through the FOREGROUND.

RUTH CONNORS, the CONNOR’S DAUGHTER, is SMOKING POT in the old
SHED that she has converted into a makeshift DEN.

A KNOCK on the DOOR ...

MRS. CONNORS (0.S.)
Ruth?

RUTH
Shit!

RUTH jumps up and starts madly waving the smoke away.

MRS. CONNORS (0.S.)

hanging out with a GROUP of BORED TEENAGERS in the LOCAL SHOPPING
MALL which is festooned with tawdry CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS. BRIAN,
CLARISSA and the others SNIGGER LOUDLY as RUTH passes.
BRIAN
Preak-a-zoid!
RUTH
Piss off shit-for-brains!
BRIAN
What are ya gonna do for a face when
the camel wants it’s ass back?

RUTH
Give it yours!

The GROUP erupts into peals of laughter.

ANGLE ON: RUTH, seen from inside a moving DOLLSHOUSE, as she
disappears from view.

INT. MALL TOY STORE - DAY 30
FROM INSIDE the DOLLSHOUSE, as MR. HARVEY carries it into the
STORE, lifting it on to COUNTER ... THE CAMERA slides out of the
window and glides along the miniature BALCONY past the GIANT
FIGURE of MR. HARVEY and settles on: AN EYE! It blinks!

STORE KEEPER 0.S
Look at that! Built-in shelves!

WIDER ON: THE STORE KEEPER rises up from behind the counter.
STORE KEEPER

disconnection.

STORE KEEPER
It’s a pleasure to be in business
with a man who takes such pride in
his work.

INSERT: MR. HARVEY fitting the HATCH of an UNDERGROUND DOOR...

STORE KEEPER (CONT’D)
What happened to the flower boxes
this year?

CLOSE ON: A WHITE WASHED WEATHERBOARD WALL - the failed FLOWER
BOXES barely visible beneath the PAINT.

STORE KEEPER (CONT’D)
(chuckling)
Did you forget to plant your spring
bulbs!

RING! RING! The familiar SOUND of a BICYCLE BELL ...

PUSH IN: A CHILD’S HAND rings a BELL on a BICYCLE at the back of
the STORE.

CLOSE ON: The STORE KEEPER talking ... but all MR. HARVEY can
hear is the heightened sound of the BELL RINGING. He looks at the
STORE KEEPER, trying to mask the conflict inside his head. -

STORE KEEPER (CONT'D)
(distant)
You‘re gonna give some little girl a
Christmas to remember!

A MOVEMENT to his LEFT makes MR. HARVEY TURN:

ABIGAIL with BUCKLEY in TOW is hurriedly BUYING a few CHRISTMAS
GIFTS from another SHOP ASSISTANT. MR. HARVEY stares as a SMALL
CHARM is slid across the COUNTER with a DOLLAR NOTE.

CLOSE ON: The tiny SILVER CHARM shaped as a HOUSE, disappears

INT. SALMON HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY (WINTER 1973) 33

SUSIE and LINDSEY are leaving for school. BUCKLEY sits at the
KITCHEN TABLE working on a CRAYON DRAWING. .

ABIGAIL produces a WOOLLEN HAND KNITTED HAT, adorned with a
POMPOM and JINGLE BELL on top. She gives it to SUSIE - who holds
the HAT as if it were a dead animal.

SUSIE
What ... is it?

ABIGAIL
(to LINDSEY)
I’ve got book club tonight. Don’t be
late home.
SUSIE and LINDSEY exchange a look as LINDSEY slips past.
ABIGAIL (CONT'D)

t'
SUSIE
Oh yeah! It’s ... lovely.
ABIGAIL
Well, put it on, it’s cold out.
EXT. SALMON HOUSE - DAY 34

SUSIE and LINDSEY head off across their LAWN. Noticing her MOTHER
watching, SUSIE reluctantly jams the JINGLE BELL HAT on.

LINDSEY
Really suits you, Suze!
INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 35

WIDE ON: SUSIE stuffing BOOKS into her school LOCKER, in the BUSY
SCHOOL CORRIDOR. From behind her locker door she hears a voice.

RAY (0.S.)
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.

SUSIE shuts the locker door and sees:
RAY SINGH ... leaning against the corridor wall.
SUSIE
Oh! Hi, Ray ...

RAY
I have a spare ticket to the
Zefferelli film. They're screening it
in the gym.
20.

SUSIE
(regaining composure)
I can‘t. Have to be home early.

RAY
You sure?

SUSIE starts to feel self conscious and averts her eyes.
CLOSE ON: SUSIE staring into the back of her LOCKER, her hands
fumbling BOOKS ... she doesn’t dare look at RAY.
SUSIE
If I don’t hurry I’11 miss my bus.

SUSIE scoops out a PILE OF BOOKS and FOLDERS ... exercise BOOKS
covered in POP STAR photos ... poetry BOOKS.

DREAMY SHOT: SUSIE spins around and finds herself staring into
RAY'S EYES.
RAY
I‘11 walk you.

RAY OFFERS his HAND ... SUSIE takes it ... in SLOW MOTION they
walk down the CORRIDOR hand in hand.

BACK TO REALITY:

SUSIE turns with an ARMFUL of BOOKS ... they topple, CRASHING to
the FLOOR! Horrified, she scrambles to PICK THEM UP.

RAY (CONT'D)
Maybe next time?

CLOSE ON: RAY gathers up SUSIE’S BIOLOGY BOOK ... he secretly
slips a FOLDED NOTE into the BOOK.

ANGLE ON: SUSIE stands ... RAY hands her the BIOLOGY BOOK.

RAY (CONT'D)
You forgot this.

SUSIE
Thanks! Well ... enjoy the movie. I
hope it’s better than the last one!

RAY
Ah, yes. Othello!

SUSIE
That guy looked pretty stupid with
black make-up on.

RAY
Sir Lawrence Olivier?

SUSIE
What a loser!
21.

RAY
Well, it’s not every actor who can
play ‘The Moor’.

RAY is staring intently at SUSIE ...

RAY (CONT'D)
(softly)
You are beautiful Susie Salmon.

RAY leans closer ...

SUSIE (V.0.}
I suddenly wished I was wearing
something other than my yellow bell-
bottoms and my stinking sheepskin
boots with dirty synthetic shearing
spilling out at the seams.

SUSIE (CONT'D)
(flustered)
Are you really from England?

RAY
Yes ...

RAY is looking deeply into SUSIE’S EYES. The corridor is
EMPTYING.

SUSIE (V.0.)
If I had known this was to be the sex
scene of my life, I would've at least
prepared a bit in advance and
reapplied my Strawberry-Banana
Kissing Potion.

RAY leans closer still ...

RAY
Susie ...

SUSIE
What?

RAY‘’S lips part slightly ... SUSIE’S eyes close ... she prepares
to receive her first dizzying KISS.

RUTH
(loudly)
For God's sake!

SUDDEN COMMOTION as RUTH CONNORS, comes storming out of a
CLASSROOM, into the CORRIDOR. PRINCIPAL CADEN is on her heels,
clutching a WOODEN ARTIST’S FIGURE.

PRINCIPAL CADEN
(annoyed)
There are no breasts on this wooden
armature.

SUSIE and RAY quickly straighten up.
36

22.

RUTH
There isn’t a nose or mouth either!
Is art about realism or stupid dolls?

PRINCIPAL CADEN
That’s enough, young lady! It’s clear
your unnecessary anatomical additions
got the Nelson boy thoroughly over-
excited!

RUTH
He stole my drawing!

PRINCIPAL CADEN
And now there are copies all over the
school! It’s flagrant abuse of a
xerox machine!

SUSIE and RAY avert their eyes as RUTH stalks past ... the MOMENT
BROKEN. PRINCIPAL CADEN scowls at them.

PRINCIPAL CADEN (CONT’D)
Move along. School’s out!
EXT. SCHOOL - DUSK 36
TRACKING: with the SCHOOL BUS as it pulls away from the ENTRANCE.
SUSIE runs out of the school as the bus DISAPPEARS. She slows to
a walk as she realizes she is one of the FEW KIDS left in the
near empty car park.

SUSIE has no choice - she sets off towards the CORNFIELD which
lies between the SCHOOL and her STREET.

ANGLE ON: AHEAD, RUTH is already walking across the CORNFIELD,
weaving around the DEAD STALKS and broken HUSKS.

INT. SALMON HOUSE - NIGHT 37
CLOSE ON: BUCKLEY’S DRAWING is now taped to the FRIDGE - a curved
horizon with layers of cloud and sky, rendered with sweeps of
BOLD COLOUR ... he looks proudly on, as ABIGAIL crosses back to
the BENCH with some CHOPS.

LINDSEY is watching "The Partridge Family” on TV.

JACK arrives home. BUCKLEY leaps on him!

JACK
Whoa! Help! Oxygen please!

JACK disentangles BUCKLEY and kisses ABIGAIL on the cheek.

INTERCUT CLOSE UPS: RUTH’S FEET and SUSIE’S FEET trampling across
the ICY FIELDS ... the LIGHT is dropping fast on this MURKY
WINTER AFTERNOON.

ANGLE ON: RUTH hurries on, hunching against the COLD ... DARKNESS
is closing in ... RUTH makes it to the FAR SIDE of the CORNFIELD
and disappears into TREES.

WIDE ON: SUSIE is now ALONE, halfway across the CORNFIELD ...
away in the distance BOYS play SOCCER on the SCHOOL FIELDS ...
faint SHOUTS as a GOAL is scored.

CLOSE ON: SUSIE‘S FEET crunching.

SUSIE walks briskly, pulling her COAT around her. She takes the
JINGLE BELL HAT out of her pocket and JAMS IT ON ... in the
process dropping her BIOLOGY BOOK ...

Before SUSIE can pick the book up, the WIND flicks the PAGES OPEN
and RAY‘S NOTE blows out ... SUSIE frowns and HURRIES after it.

CLOSE ON: The NOTE rolls and sails amongst the BROKEN CORN
STALKS, managing to stay just ahead of SUSIE'S outstretched
FINGERS.

INT. SALMON LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT 39

The STOVE TIMER RINGS.

EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT 40

MR. HARVEY
You're the Salmon girl, right?

SUSIE is taken aback.

SUSIE
Yes.

MR. HARVEY
I‘ve built something back here. Would
you like to see it?

MR. HARVEY GESTURES to a patch of BROKEN GROUND, hidden amidst
the CORN REMNANTS.

SUSIE
Actually, Mr Harvey, I have to get
home -

MR. HARVEY
It won't take long ... Come on, Susie
- you can spare five minutes.

CLOSE ON: SUSIE stares MR. HARVEY ... caught off guard.

SUSIE (V.0.)
I was kind of flattered that he knew
my name. I wish now I had known this
was weird ...

SUSIE glances at the ground with a mix of SUSPICION and
CURIOSITY.

SUSIE (CONT'D)
I don’t see anything.

ANGLE ON: MR. HARVEY ... HEADLIGHTS from PASSING TRUCKS reflect
in his GLASSES.

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I was aware that Mr Harvey was
looking at me strangely. Older men
had looked at me that way since I'd
lost my baby fat, but not when I was
wearing my royal blue parka and
yellow elephant bell-bottoms.
MR. (VEY
You should be more observant, Susie.
MR. HARVEY taps his foot on the ground: a HOLLOW SOUND.

SUSIE
What is it?

SUSIE walks forward, CURIOUS.

CLOSE ON: With each STEP, a thin layer of ICE cracks beneath
SUSIE’S FEET ... like breaking glass.

ABIGAIL calling everyone to dinner.

ABIGAIL

Susie?

LINDSEY has almost finished her meal. ABIGAIL keeps glancing out
of the WINDOW, looking for SUSIE coming down the STREET.

LINDSEY
Maybe she went to the mall.

ABIGAIL
(concerned)
What would she be doing at the mall?

LINDSEY
(shrugs)
Clarissa got a job at Dairy Queen.

JACK is already on his feet, hauling on his JACKET.
JACK
I'll go.

44 EXT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - NIGHT 44
As MR. HARVEY helps SUSIE down the STAIRS, the CAMERA SINKS past
BROKEN CORNSTALKS. BUGS crawling over the DEAD BROWN PLANTS.

45 INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - NIGHT 45
ANGLE ON: SUSIE steps off the BOTTOM STAIR and takes in the
UNDERGROUND ROOM: the SHELF adorned with small decorative
HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS ... a GLASS with a TOOTHBRUSH ... a MIRROR ...
in any other circumstances, this would be a child’s dream fort.

SUSIE
(surprised)
Hey! This is neato!

MR. HARVEY
Look around. Make yourself at home.

46 INT, SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT 46

TRACKING WITH JACK: as he strides through the MALL. Mindless 70's
MUZAK bounces off store windows and tiled floors as the SHOPS
prepare to close up. JACK scans the CROWD for any sign of SUSIE.

SERIES of QUICK IMAGES: several BROWN-HAIRED GIRLS - anyone of.
whom could be SUSIE - turn their HEADS as the CAMERA races past.

JACK finds CLARISSA serving at DAIRY QUEEN ... BRIAN is nearby
Playing PINBALL with a GROUP of FRIENDS. They haven‘t seen SUSIE.

As JACK hurries away, he hears A SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER as BRIAN
makes a JOKE at JACK’S expense.

itiful lie. I imagined he was
onely.
MR. HARVEY
I thought it could be some sort of

SUSIE (V.0.)
We had read about men like him in
health class. Men who never married
and who ate frozen meals every night.
I felt sorry for him even though he
gave me the skeevies!
CLOSE ON: SUSIE’S EYES stray towards the STAIRS.
MR. HARVEY
Would you like a refreshment, Susie?

TRACKING: JACK driving back through the neighbourhood scanning
the streets.

INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - NIGHT 49

MR. HARVEY’S PHOTO FLICKERS in the CANDLE LIGHT, SUSIE holding a
COKE is reflected in the GLASS. This SAME PHOTO is later seen in
other places: in his car, his house ~- it’s his preferred image of
himself. The respectable persona he has spent years cultivating.

MR. HARVEY
It’s so warm in here. Why don’t you
take off your parka?

SUSIE is feeling very uncomfortable ... without taking her eyes
off MR. HARVEY, she slowly puts her COKE BOTTLE down on the SHELF
«+. mext to a SHAVING BRUSH and RAZOR.

against it.

Sit down.

MR. HARVEY pulls SUSIE down off the STAIRS and shoves her onto a
BENCH.

(babbling)
If I’m late home, Mom's gonna be mad
as hell. It’s book club night - she’s
gonna be really upset if she’s misses
her meeting!

MR. HARVEY
You’re not leaving Susie ...

struggles to fight off MR. HARVEY.

could not to let Mr. Harvey hurt me.
But “as hard as I could" was not good
enough. It was not even close.

CLOSE ON: SUSIE'S FACE as RADIO MUSIC from distant TRUCKS whizzes
past.

IMAGES: of disturbed SOIL, SUSIE’S discarded SHOE ... a COKE
bottle half buried in churned up DIRT.

SUSIE (V.0.)
All I knew was he had done this thing
to me and I had lived. I was still
breathing.

CLOSE ON: MR. HARVEY leans over SUSIE, gently brushing away a
lock of her HAIR from her damp forehead ... his GLASSES reflect
the smiling PHOTOGRAPH of himself in both LENSES.

and lifts the heavy LID, peering inside.

At that moment: JACK looks across the STREET, and his GAZE
settles on a rough looking HOMELESS GUY. JACK moves towards him
with PURPOSE. The HOMELESS GUY becomes AWARE of JACK’S focus and
starts to HURRY AWAY.

JACK runs across the STREET ... SUDDEN SQUEAL of BRAKES! A CAR
has to SWERVE SUDDENLY to avoid hitting JACK.

JACK stumbles and loses his GRIP on SUSIE’S PHOTO ... it gets

like SUSIE.

opens the car door and angrily hurls it shut, jolting JACK out of
his reverie.

Neither JACK nor LINDSEY notice HOLIDAY bounding away from the
CAR towards the CORNFIELD.

. JACK
I'll come get you after school.

PRINCIPAL CADEN swoops in, guiding LINDSEY towards the corridor.

PRINCIPAL CADEN
Lindsey ... I’ve just spoken with the
police. The staff - the entire
school, want you to know we are so
very sorry.

LINDSEY
Sorry for what?

PRINCIPAL CADEN hurries to keep up with LINDSEY as she strides

Well ... for your loss.

FENERMAN
It appears to be a love letter.

ABIGAIL
A love letter ... to Susie?

FENERMAN
We've recovered some items of
interest.

JACK
What does that mean?

FENERMAN
We've found the remains of a ...
cavity in the earth ... some kind of
wooden structure.

JACK attempts to digest this. He looks RATTLED ... He knows that
on some level things are looking ominous but he can’t quite
process this new information and chooses to focus only on what he
can manage. ABIGAIL, on the other hand, is processing too much.

ABIGAIL
Jack, I want to go home. Now. Please.

JACK
I’m sorry - I don’t follow. How is
this relevant?

PENERMAN
We don’t know if these things are
relevant, Mr. Salmon. We've sent the
wood and soil samples to the lab.

boxes away to reveal an OLD-FASHIONED SAFE.

MR. HARVEY is dishevelled ... shoes muddied, bits of CORN-STALK
are stuck to his trousers. He is breathing hard, his agitation
fills the CONFINED SPACE ... He fumbles at the SAFE DIALS and
wrenches open the DOOR.

MR. HARVEY hauls a SACK towards the SAFE - a WAXY, ORANGE SACK
leaking a DARK, VISCOUS LIQUID which STAINS the CONCRETE FLOOR.
He stuffs the SACK into the SAFE.

THUD! The heavy SAFE-DOOR smashes SHUT ...

SUSIE looks around in growing ALARM as the SHOPPING MALL starts
closing down in a spooky, automated kind of way ...

ESCALATORS lurch to a juddering halt ... METAL GRILLS grind down
over dimming shop frontagea ... ORNAMENTAL FOUNTAINS abruptly
shut off ... the ubiquitous MALL MUZAK SLOWS to a distorted
atonal whine, eventually subsiding into STATIC WHITE NOISE ...
while all around FLUORESCENT LIGHTS FLICKER and die ...

THUD! THUD! SUSIE is now trapped in PITCH DARKNESS, the SOUNDS of
the SHOPPING MALL DECAY to NOTHING ...

ANGLE ON: in the distance, lit by a single spotlight in the inky
black, is MR HARVEY'S SAFE.

CRASHING through a life-size DOLLSHOUSE DOOR, sprawling onto her
CK.

the CAR - replaying a familiar scene from a different point of
view.

MR. HARVEY accelerates away...

SUDDENLY, SUSIE'S PHOTO swirls in the wind and lands against MR.

HARVEY'S WINDSCREEN. For a SPLIT SECOND, he finds himself looking

be replaced by a REFLECTION of MR. HARVEY staring wild-eyed into

leaving light trails like sky rockets.

SUSIE'S eyes swing back to EARTH ... she stares back at the world
from which she has fled. There is a mortified expression on her
face ... as her pace slows almost to a stop.

HOLLY (0.S.)
Don‘t stop! You’re not supposed to
stop!

SUSIE looks around and sees HOLLY ... a VIETNAMESE GIRL of around
13 years of age running towards her wildly waving her arms.

HOLLY (CONT'D)

sitting in the middle of a PARK ... DOGS of all varieties run
free on rippling LAWNS ... OLD FASHIONED STREET LAMPS with
hanging globes throw pools of light on to ICE CREAM SHOPS,
MAGAZINE STANDS ... there are FOOTBALL FIELDS ... HOUSES and
SCHOOLS ... it’s SUSIE’S world as she knew it - filtered through
the BDEALIZED LENS of a teenage girl. An eclectic mix of DREAM

personal existence ... in their own altered realities.

SUSIE

HOLLY is staring at SUSIE’S ROYAL BLUE PARKA ...

Oh my God! I’ve got an eyeshadow that

ABIGAIL dutifully kisses her MOTHER as the HUGE FUR COAT is
unceremoniously dumped in her arms. GRANDMA LYNN makes a beeline

GRANDMA LYNN starts fumbling around in her handbag.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT'D)
Nothing’s going to happen to me. Do

FENERMAN offers the PHOTO to MR. HARVEY ... who starts searching
for his READING GLASSES.

FENERMAN takes in the IDEALIZED PHOTO of MR. HARVEY on the TV
SET, but doesn’t respond.

MR. HARVEY (CONT'D)
Awful. Just awful. What a terrible
thing to happen. How’s the
investigation going? Have you spoken
to the Ellis boy? I heard a rumour he
tortures animals.

FENERMAN
How long did you say you lived here?

MR. HARVEY
Let's see, I moved here after Leah
passed away ... so that would make it

- six years.
FENERMAN
Leah?
MR. HARVEY

My late wife. We bought this house
just before she was diagnosed.

MR. HARVEY finds his READING GLASSES, and pops them on ... taking
in the PHOTO of SUSIE.

was very quick.

The darkened outline of a DISUSED QUARRY ... as MR. HARVEY’S
WAGON crawls to a stop.

WIDE ON: Under the COLD LIGHT of a WINTER'S MOON, MR. HARVEY
wends his way through towering SLAG HEAPS and WATER FILLED HOLES.
It looks like an ALIEN LANDSCAPE.

flickering CANDLE.

INT. SALMON HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 113

TRACKING: down the HALL to find ABIGAIL lying alone in BED,
unable to SLEEP. She stares into the blackness of the room.

SUSIE (V.0.)
I knew what she was thinking. That I
was out there somewhere; I knew she
hoped that I was safe and and
warm... But in the back of her mind
she wondered ...

EXT. OLD QUARRY - NIGHT 114

MR. HARVEY stands near the top of a recently excavated slope,
fishes something from his pocket ...

CLOSE ON: SUSIE'S CHARM BRACELET in MR. HARVEY'S HAND.

MR. HARVEY stares at it for a long moment, reluctant to give up
his trophy.

Impulsively he yanks the LITTLE HOUSE CHARM off the silver link
chain and slips it into his POCKET.

ANGLE ON: MR. HARVEY hurls the BRACELET high into the AIR.

SUSIE (V.0.).

And at night my mother dreamt of
crumpled corn stalks and warrens of
wild rabbits and gardens laced with
toxic bait ...

ANGLE ON: Wisps of MR. HARVEY'S frozen breath hang in the air as
he watches SUSIE’S CHARM BRACELET arc up and over the CHASM of
the QUARRY ... disappearing into darkness ...
INT. SALMON HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 115
CLOSE ON: ABIGAIL as she closes her eyes ...
SUSIE (V.0.)

And inside the earth she saw an

entire family of rabbits curl into

themselves and die.
INT. SALMON HOUSE - DAY (SUMMER 1974) 116

ABIGAIL opens the door to find LEN FENERMAN on her doorstep.
52.

ABIGAIL
(composes herself)
Detective Fenerman. Jack will be home
soon. I know he wanted to talk with
you.

FENERMAN
He must’ve left me a dozen messages.
He seems to have a theory about
everyone in the neighbourhood.

ABIGAIL
Yes well, I’m sure you’re too busy to
wait.

FENERMAN

Not too busy.

ANGLE ON: FENERMAN sits at the kitchen table, watching ABIGAIL
help BUCKLEY with a crayon drawing.

FENERMAN (CONT'D)
What is that?

ABIGAIL
Don’t ask. I have no talent for
drawing.
FENERMAN
No, seriously, what is it? A bread
roll! No, wa: ~ a pancake!
BUCKLEY
(gravely)
It‘s a merry-go-round.
FENERMAN
Oh yeah! Course. It’s obvious.
ABIGAIL

You are such a bad liar.

. PENERMAN
I know. It’s a terrible handicap in
this job.

ABIGAIL starts to laugh. The laughter catches in her throat and
turns into sobs.

BUCKLEY
Mommy ...?

ABIGAIL
I’m sorry...
(to BUCKLEY)
I’m alright ... Mommy’s alright.

ABIGAIL searches for a handkerchief; not finding one she pulls a
RED SILK SCARF free from around her neck and starts to mop her
eyes.

ABIGAIL looks at FENERMAN ... it‘s been a while since someone has
looked at her as anything other than a mother or wife.

FENERMAN (CONT'D)
Not many women can wear that color.
It’s beautiful.

FENERMAN’S fingers close around ABIGAIL’S HAND.

INT. MR. HARVEY'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 117
MR. HARVEY sits on a chair in the middle of the basement.

He is sweating. There is a TENSE EXPRESSION on his face. He is in
CONFLICT: his internal tension is BUILDING.

EXT. VALLEY FORGE PARK - MORNING (AUTUMN 1974) 118

ANGLE ON: A FAMILY of KIDS and PARENTS are playing with their
FAMILY DOG, a beautiful GOLDEN RETRIEVER. They are laughing and
squealing with delight. An 8 YEAR OLD throws a STICK into the
WOODS, and they laugh as the DOG BOUNDS into the TREES after it.

SUSIE (V.0)
Mr. Harvey started taking risks...

CLOSE ON: The DOG chases after the stick, deep into the woods ...
suddenly stopping short at the STICK, which lies at MR. HARVEY'S
FEET.

SUSIE (V.0) (CONT'D)
For me the saddest thing was that
animals smelt the brokenness in him
«+. the human defect.

ANGLE ON: MR. HARVEY’S white STATION WAGON slides out of the
PARKING LOT ... in the DISTANCE, the FAMILY are SEARCHING the
WOODS for their pet.

ANGLE ON: A SCREAMING MOTHER ... finding a DISMEMBERED DOG.

INT. SALMON HOUSE/SUSIE‘S BEDROOM - NIGHT (SUMMER 1975) 119

CLOSE ON: The LID of a SHOE BOX opens - full of SUSIE’S
PHOTOGRAPHS.

JACK is sitting on her bed. He lifts the SHOE BOX out and beneath
it is another box marked “Rolls to Hold Back” in SUSIE‘’S
handwriting ... with another of her scrawls across the lid:
“Rolls to be Sent Out ... One per Month!!!”

FLASH BACK TO:

120 INT. SALMON KITCHEN - DAY (SUMMER 1973) 120

CLOSE ON: DOZENS of ROLLS of undeveloped KODAK FILM clatter out
of a SHOEBOX on to the KITCHEN TABLE.

ANGLE ON: ABIGAIL turns from the STOVE in SURPRISE ...

ABIGAIL
Have you gone through all the film
you got for your birthday?

SUSIE
Not entirely.

ABIGAIL
There must be twelve rolls in this
box! Who’s going to pay to get them
developed?

SUSIE
I thought you might.

ABIGAIL
Well, you'd better think again.

SUSIE
But Dad said my artistic shots are
basically genius.

JACK
I think I‘ve been misquoted.

SUSIE
Dad!

JACK
One roll a month. That’s my best
offer.

SUSIE
But!!! You realise by the time I see
these pictures, I’m gonna be middle-
aged?

ON THE SOUNDTRACK: SUSIE’S VOICE DECAYS AWAY ...

ABIGAIL (0.S.)
Jack?

JACK turns around and sees ABIGAIL standing in the CORRIDOR.

121 INT. SALMON HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT (SUMMER 1975) 121

ANGLE ON: ABIGAIL in her nightgown, standing bare foot in the
corridor. She looks fragile and drawn.

JACK goes over to ABIGAIL ...

JACK
What are you doing up?
55.

ABIGAIL
I couldn’t sleep.

JACK gently wraps his arms around her.

JACK
Abbie ...

ABIGAIL
What happened to us?

JACK

Do you know how much I love you?

ABIGAIL looks up at JACK in surprise ... he kisses her tenderly.

122 INT. HEAVEN/GAZEBO - NIGHT 122

ANGLE ON: HOLLY wanders into the GAZEBO, performing impossibly
COMPLEX tricks with a YO-YO.

: HOLLY
Yeech! I hate it when that happens.
It’s just so gross when parents kiss.
Thank God, mine hardly ever did!

SUSIE is sitting on the FLOOR of the GAZEBO. As SUSIE turns to
HOLLY, the IMAGE of JACK and ABIGAIL HUGGING, plummets away to
become a DISTANT view of SUSIE’S old STREET.

HOLLY (CONT'D)
There should be some kind of law
against the over forties doing it.

SUSIE
They're not over forty.

HOLLY
I did a head count the other day. I
reckon I’ve kissed a hundred guys.

SUSIE
A hundred?

HOLLY
Up here, I mean. I didn’t do so well
on earth. What about you?

SUSIE
I only ever wanted to kiss one
person.

HOLLY flips the YO-YO into gravity defying series of loops.

HOLLY
Did ya do it?

SUSIE shakes her head.

HOLLY (CONT‘D)
Bummer.

SILENCE ...

HOLLY (CONT'D)
Cheer up. There’s lots better places
than this.

SUSIE
What kind of places?

HOLLY
I don’t know exactly. But it’s where
my grandfather is. He’s gonna come
and get me.

SUSIE (V.0.)

I began to wonder what the word
heaven meant. If this was heaven,
truly heaven, it would be where my
grandparents lived ... where my
father’s father, my favourite of all,
would lift me up and dance with me
and I would feel only joy and have no
memory ... no cornfield ... no grave.

JACK (0.S.)
The school want to have a memorial
service.

123 INT. SALMON HOUSE/JACK’S STUDY - NIGHT 123
ANGLE ON: JACK gently brushes ABIGAIL’S hair away from her FACE.

JACK
They think it would be good for the
kida ...

ABIGAIL looks away ...

ABIGAIL
It won’t change anything ... I see
her on the street, on the bus,
outside the school. I see her hair,
her body ... the way she moved. I
know she’s gone, but I can’t accept
oe

JACK
You live through it, Abbie. It’s all
you can do.

ABIGAIL looks at JACK ... for the first time since she lost her
daughter her husband is offering her real comfort.

ABIGAIL
I thought for a moment we'd lost each
other.

JACK

I was lost. I was overwhelmed.

CAMERA pushes in on ABIGAIL as JACK continues ...

JACK (CONT'D)

I was trying to cope with all of it.
I thought it was up to me. But it was
too much ... and I realized I had to
take a step back. I said to myself:
keep it simple. Keep it small. Focus
on the familiar. The neighbourhood.
The school. Her circle of friends.

CAMERA continues to push in on ABIGAIL as she begins to register
a horror even deeper than their shared grief...

JACK (CONT'D)
Statistics tell us there’s a ninety
percent probability this crime was
committed by a local. He knew her!

EXT. ST. PETER’S CHURCH - DAY (WINTER 1975) 124

CLOSE ON: MR. HARVEY, OUT OF FOCUS ... adjusts his tie as he
walks three steps behind JACK SALMON.

JACK is watching a SERIES of FACES slide past him... He studies
each one with intent.

SOUNDTRACK: Wafts of dreary ORGAN MUSIC ...

WIDE ON: a LARGE GROUP of MOURNERS are wending their way solemnly
towards a neat, white Revolutionary era CHURCH ... ancient
TOMBSTONES surround the old building.

MR. HARVEY slides by OUT OF FOCUS - the invisible man.

INT. ST. PETER’S CHURCH - DAY 125

ANGLE ON: SUSIE’S SCHOOL PHOTO, now framed in gold leaf and
wreathed with flowers, sits at the head of the AISLE.

ABIGAIL walks towards it, to take her SEAT in the FRONT ROW. JACK
joins her, taking in the PEOPLE in each PEW as he passes ... the
STEADS, the GILBERTS, with young daughter TESSA.

REVEREND STRICK addresses the gathering from the pulpit.

REVEREND STRICK (V.O.)
Two years ago an unimaginable evil
found it’s way into the heart of this
community and preyed upon that which
we fzeasure most - the life of a

ANGLE ON: MR. TARKING, looks up to see JACK SALMON staring at
him. Unnerved MR. TARKING looks away... deep in the BACKGROUND we
glimpse the OUT OF FOCUS face of MR. HARVEY, pious and humble.

REVEREND STRICK (CONT’D)
But it is not our place to question
the will of the God...

ANGLE ON: the BACK ROW, BRIAN’S hand slides up CLARISSA’S thigh.

REVEREND STRICK'S voice fades to dull MUMBLE ... WHITE NOISE
BUILDS.

INSERTS: MACRO SHOTS OF ... a wisp of BLONDE CURLING HAIR ...
small fingers clutch the prayer book ... a glimpse of white
socks.

126 EXT. ZOOK CEMETERY - DAY (WINTER 1975) 126

WIDE ON: RAY sitting alone in a SMALL ancient CEMETERY, reading a
MEDICAL TEXT BOOK.

SUSIE
Ray's world began to take on other
shapes ...

CLOSE ON: The page in the large book on RAY’S knee turns to
reveal images of human biology ...

SUSIE (CONT'D)
The shapes of muscle and sinew; of
heartbeats and blood flows. The world
of the living and breathing.

RAY LOOKS UP as RUTH approaches through the GRAVESTONES.

RUTH
I thought you’d be at the service.
RAY shakes his head.

SUSIE (V.0)
He was slipping away from me ...

RUTH digs her hand in her PEACOAT POCKET, pulls out a CHAPSTICK.

RUTH
Want some?

RAY takes the stick of lip balm and looks at it doubtfully.

SUSIE (V.0.)
But then Ruth Connors, that strange,
weird girl - who, if anything, had
gotten even stranger and weirder ...
would bring him back.

RAY
What are you doing here?

RUTH shrugs.
RUTH
I guess I like hanging out with dead
people.
RAY

I miss her ...

SUSIE (V.0O.)
Ray never quite understood why he
found comfort in her sureness ... in
her willingness to count the presence
of the dead among the living ...

ANGLES ON: RUTH walking with RAY ... FALLEN, CROOKED old
TOMBSTONES seems to surround her from every angle.

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
But together they kept me alive in
the back of their minds.

RAY
People still think I did something. I
see them looking at me side-ways.

RUTH
I know.

RUTH slips her arm through his...

RAY
Brian Nelson reckons he’s gonna punch
my lights out.

RUTH
Brian Nelson is a toe-nail chewing
latrine cake. If that guy had a price
on his head - I'd be the first to
volunteer.

RAY smiles ...
RAY
Just be sure to use a weapon that
can’t be traced.

RUTH
What kind of weapon can’t be traced?

RAY steps towards a GNARLED TREE and reaches up to a LOW HANGING
BRANCH.

CLOSE ON: RAY gently snaps a small, delicate icicle hanging from
the frozen BRANCH. It is sharp, pointed, almost invisible ...

ANGLE ON: RAY drops it, IMPALING it into the SOIL like a KNIFE
«+.» it immediately begins to MELT.

RUTH (CONT’D)
That‘s clever.

SILENCE hangs between them a beat.
RUTH (CONT'D)
You‘re wrong, though ... it always
leaves a trace.

follow his gaze to find he is looking at ...

holds centre-stage, overblown arrangements of FLOWERS flanking it
on either side.

Push in on the FRAMED PHOTO of SUSIE ... a TYPICAL SCHOOL
PORTRAIT ... her smiling face revealing a mouth full of braces.

SUSIE
This is supposed to be the saddest
day of my life! It's supposed to mean
gomething! How can anyone mourn my

passing when I look so utterly geeky!

INT. HEAVEN/GAZEBO —DAY 128

REVEREND STRICK is leading the MOURNERS into an appallingly
dreary version of: “How Great Thou Art” ... SUSIE turns away from
EARTH.

A murmur ripples through the CROWD. SUSIE brightens upon hearing
snatches of conversation ...”“She was too young!"; “So
beautifull"; “Incredibly talented!"; "What an unimaginable
tragedy!"

SUSIE turns to look back ...

INT. ST. PETER'S CHURCH - DAY 129

INSERT: The picture of SUSIE in the FRAMED SCHOOL PHOTO dissolves
into a shot of SUSIE looking like a TEENAGE GLAMOUR QUEEN.

ON the SOUND-TRACK the ORGAN MUSIC transitions into: “Cherish” by
8 8:

DAVID CASSIDY
(sings)
Cherish is a word I used to describe,
All the feelings that I have hiding
here for you inside ...

SCHOOL PUPILS wail and sob ... flinging themselves in wild spasms
of GRIEF at the foot of SUSIE’S glamour queen photo.

Cherish me as much as I cherish you

PRINCIPAL CADEN and other TEACHERS, with tear streaked faces

Of course, Detective.

ANGLE ON: ABIGAIL taking a long drag on a cigarette ... she and
FENERMAN are semi hidden in a sheltered spot behind the CHAPEL.

ANGLE ON: A DOG CARCASS thuds to the FLOOR. MR HARVEY picks up
his garden SHEARS and kneels over the BODY ... he begins to
DISMEMBER the ANIMAL ... his CALM PACE contrasts the sickening
CRUNCHING NOISES.

SUSIE (V.0.)
By taking lesser lives he tried to
stay away from what he wanted most;
to go upstairs and sit in the dark in
the straight back chair; to look out
towards another house ...

FLASH INSERTS: a WISP of CURLING BLONDE HAIR ... WHITE ANKLE
SOCKS ... a SILVER BUCKLE on a PATENT LEATHER SHOE....

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT’D)
And give in to his lust.

+++ MR. HARVEY scatters QUICK LIME from a bag. We see him spread
it over the REMAINS of several DEAD DOGS and CATS, laying a HOLE
neatly dug in his BASEMENT FLOOR.

He suddenly FREEZES as the GLOW of a passing HEADLIGHT sweeps
through the narrow basement window, momentarily illuminating him.
EXT. SALMON STREET - CHRISTMAS EVE 132

SAMUEL still wearing the HELMET sits down opposite LINDSEY at the
kitchen table.

Are you going to open it?

ANGLE ON: LINDSEY looking very uncertain.
LINDSEY
Are you going to take off your
helmet?

SAMUEL reaches across and pulls the oven mitts off LINDSEY’S
HANI!

SAMUEL
Open it.
LINDSEY unwraps the present and opens a small box which contains
HALF A GOLD HEART. She looks up as SAMUEL finally wrenches the
HELMET off his head ... tussled hair falls down his forehead.

LINDSEY sees the other half of the GOLD HEART PENDANT hanging
around his neck on a rawhide cord.

SAMUEL (CONT'D)
Do you like it?

LINDSEY
It’s not that ...

LINDSEY looks away.

LINDSEY (CONT'D)

CLOSE ON: MR. HARVEY pushes his FOCUS past MRS GILBERT ... at
JACK SALMON, striding straight towards him! MR. HARVEY can do
nothing ...

SUSPENDED MOMENT: JACK walks Fight at MR HARVEY, intent on his

much to drink.

You know what your problem is: you’re
weak. You always took the easy
option. You never once in your life
toughed it out.

ABIGAIL steels herself for the verbal onslaught.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT‘D)
I don’t know why - but you always had
terrible self esteem.

ABIGAIL
I‘m sorry I’ve been such a
disappointment.

GRANDMA LYNN
You‘re not a disappointment. You’re
very much a product of your father’s
genes.

GRANDMA LYNN drains her HIGHBALL GLASS.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
He had a long term affair with a
woman in New Hampshire.

ABIGAIL is taken aback - she’s not sure if this is the liquor
talking.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
I didn’t like it but I put up with it
- for twelve years. I wanted to
confront him. I wanted to dispatch a
death blow to the ‘other woman’ But I
didn’t. It was a tactical decision. I
kept my weight down and my hair
coloured and our home looking nice. I
out-lasted her!

He‘s hunting your daughter's
murderer. That’s a brave thing. Abbie
darling, don’t you see? You have to
be brave.

GRANDMA LYNN pounces on a bottle, and stands up, clutching it to

ABIGAIL
That’s cooking sherry.

GRANDMA LYNN
You won’t go into Susie’s room. You
don’t let anyone touch her things.
qhere is a tomb in the middle of your
jouse

ABIGAIL is SILENT. Her mother has hit a nerve.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT‘D)
Do you think if you seal it up - the
pain goes away?

ABIGAIL
It never goes away.

GRANDMA LYNN
Then how do you expect this family to
heal?

question.

LINDSEY
I don’t know.

LINDSEY wrestles a SWEATER down BUCKLEY'S arms ... BUCKLEY'S
anxious face suddenly pops out from neck of the SWEATER ...

BUCKLEY
Are we not going to be a family any
more?

ANGLE ON: GRANDMA LYNN'S arms are crossed, she has a no nonsense
expression on her face.

GRANDMA LYNN
Of course we’re a family! Your mother
is in crisis and your father is a

wreck.

LINDSEY
What are you?

GRANDMA LYNN

I'm in charge!

On the SOUNDTRACK: Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress by The
Hollies:

IMAGES: GRANDMA LYNN cleaning and smoking simultaneously;
sweeping floor debris under rugs ... she VICIOUSLY KICKS the
washing machine ... flooding the laundry with soap suds.

GRANDMA LYNN (V.0) (cont‘d)
I will refrain from drinking ...
until five o’clock on week nights and
until lunchtime on Saturdays and
Sunday.

IMAGES: GRANDMA LYNN pulling a tiny shrunken t-shirt out of the
dryer and staring at it mystified ... serving up awful looking
shrivelled meals; we notice a GRADUAL DETERIORATION in GRANDMA
LYNN’S normally immaculate appearance ...

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
I will not stand by and watch this
house descend in to domestic chaos.
151

FLAMES leap out from under the grill ... LINDSEY and BUCKLEY look
startled!

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
Oh shit! Where do you keep the take
out menu?

ANGLE ON: GRANDMA LYNN taking control of LINDSEY'S makeup ... she
sits LINDSEY back in a chair and applies CUCUMBERS to her eyes.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT'D)
My God! Look those bags! You need
help, child! I’m starting you on the
seven day beauty plan.

CLOSE ON: OATMEAL FACE-PACK is being spatulated onto an alarmed
LINDSEY'S FACE.

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
Cleanse, tone and moisturize. Beauty
comes from within: jars, tubes and
compacts!

CLOSE ON: EGG YOKES poured on LINDSEY‘S HEAD!

GRANDMA LYNN (CONT’D)
Greasy hair is just another word for
ugly.

ANGLE ON: LINDSEY looking beautiful, as SAMUEL HECKLER has DINNER
with the FAMILY ... GRANDMA LYNN, displaying an inappropriate
amount of CLEAVAGE, is flirting outrageously with SAMUEL. LINDSAY
takes her arm and firmly steers her out of the ROOM.

SUSIE (V.0.
yy grandmother, in all her obnoxious
inery, opened up our house and
dragged the light back in.

INT. MR. HARVEY’S HOUSE - DAY 151

ANGLE ON: RAIN DRIBBLES down MR. HARVEY‘S WINDOWS, throwing a
watery light into his LIVING ROOM.

He sits in his ARM CHAIR watching TELEVISION. He’s SEWING with
purposeful concentration .... IMAGES of a NEEDLE being pulled, as
ie WORKS from a tray perched on his lap. GLIMPSES of PINK and
WHITE CLOTH.

On the TV: a DOCUMENTARY describing an exotic culture in MALI.

TV NARRATOR
Unique among the many cultures of
Mali are the Imezzureg people.

TV IMAGES: TRIBES PEOPLE constructing an elaborate TENT from
stripped sapling branches.

WIDER: MR. HARVEY'S impassive eyes flick to a CAT ... cautiously
making it’s way across his LIVING ROOM, drawn to a BOWL of FOOD
sitting on newspaper in the middle of the room.

ANGLE ON: A CAR draws up at the edge of a BEACH.

ABIGATL gets out and clambers down the cliffs towards the ROLLING

CLOSE ON: Her feet carefully climb over ROCKS ... then steps into
the WATER. Her FACE is still, and distant, as the SEA BREEZE
ruffles her hair.

She steps deeper into the WATER.
AT THAT MOMENT: a CHILD LAUGHS.

ABIGAIL turns, and sees a young TODDLER playing dengerously close
to the waves ... her PARENTS distracted further along the beach.

ANGLE ON: ABIGAIL scoops the child up, ++. it LAUGHS, and she
responds, something in her FREES at that MOMENT. She carries the
BABY back to it’s PARENTS.

EXT. CALIFORNIA VINEYARD - DAY 153
ABIGAIL picking GRAPES.

SUSIE (V.0.)
That same week my mother found work
at Krusoe Winery.

IMAGES: of ABIGAIL with FELLOW WORKERS.

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
She never mentioned a husband. And
when people asked her, she said she
had two children.

CLOSE ON: ABIGAIL.

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
She would feel it then, creeping into
her gut, the onslaught, the grief
coming, the tears approaching like a
relentless army. She would breathe it
in, to try to stop herself from
erying in public.

INT. JACK’S STUDY - DAY 154

CLOSE ON: JACK picks up a tattered KODAK ENVELOPE, lying amid old
BILLS and LETTERS.
155

SUSIE (V.0.)
My father didn't understand how two
people who were married, who saw each
other every day, could end up ag
strangers ...

He sits in his chair, slowly thumbing through the photos f.
SUSIE'S last roll of film. © $ $ Prewog rom

SUSIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
And yet the more he looked at her
the more he felt it: a familiar
feeling that he couldn’t quite name.

CLOSE ON: SUSIE’S PHOTO of ABIGAIL: A FAMILIAR IMAGE ... she is
sitting on the back porch, lost in thought ...

SUSIE (V.0) (CONT’D
It took him a long time to realise
what it was ... he was falling in
love with her all over again.

CLOSE ON: JACK as this thought sinks in.

ANOTHER PHOTO: Something has changed in ABIGAIL’S EXPRESSION ...
She is no longer vulnerable ... it’s as if a switch has been
flicked and she is shutting down ...

SUSIE (V.0) (CONT'D)
And he began to see ...

NEXT PHOTO: JACK is leaning into shot, KISSING ABIGAIL - and in
that moment JACK sees it: ABIGAIL, the woman with whom he fell in
love, has gone. She has been replaced by the woman who became his
wife and the mother of his children: a mask worn for so many
years that it now slips easily and effortlessly into place.

EXT. SALMON HOUSE - DAY (AUTUMN 1976) 155

CLOSE ON: LEN FENERMAN takes a drag on a cigarette, outside the
SALMON'S FRONT DOOR. He’s hurrying to finish it before ringing
the DOORBELL.

He suddenly hears footsteps approaching from inside the house,
stubs out the cigarette, and grabs the heavy brass KNOCKER ...
the DOOR swings open. LINDSEY is staring at him.
73.

LINDSEY
Those things will kill you.

FENERMAN
Is your father in?

156 INT. SALMON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY 156

JACK looks up as FENERMAN walks into the room, tailed by LINDSEY

JACK
What‘s on your mind, Len?

ANGLE ON: FENERMAN looking uncomfortable.

FENERMAN
Jack, this is very awkward ...

ANGLE ON: JACK looking concerned ... we watch as his expression
changes as FENERMAN talks to him...

SUSIE (V.0.)
Len Fenerman had come to tell my
father that after spending thousands
of man hours on case and after
interviewing hundreds of suspects;
there were no new clues and no fresh
leads and there was no expectation my
body would ever be found.

JACK
You're shutting down the
investigation?

FENERMAN
We're scaling it back.

JACK
Bullshit! This is bullshit, Len}!

FENERMAN
In_the beginning there was sympathy,
a lot of good will ... but the guys

at the station can only take so much.
These calls have to stop! You are
pissing people off.
74.

JACK
(incredulous)
I’ve become the villain now!

FENERMAN
We've had dozens of complaints;
invasion of privacy, trespass,
harassment ... frankly you're lucky
you haven't been charged. Jack,
you’ve gotta leave your neighbours
alone. People have a right to live in
peace.

JACK notices LINDSEY standing in the DOORWAY. FENERMAN continues
prattling on ... oblivious.

FENERMAN (CONT’D)
Look, we gave it our best shot. I’m
not proud of the result. I’m just
saying -

LINDSEY
(interrupting)
You’re quitting on us.

PENERMAN turns in surprise ...

FENERMAN
No... No, I am not.

GRANDMA LYNN comes into the room...

GRANDMA LYNN
Who’s quitting?

LINDSEY
(to LYNN)
Detective Fenerman came to tell us
he’s not going to look for Susie any
more. He’s got better things to do -
isn’t that right, Detective?

FENERMAN
Your sister is more than a number to
me. I care very much about solving
this case.

LINDSEY
Whatever.

LINDSEY walks off in disgust.
GRANDMA LYNN

The front door is open, Detective.
Close it on your way out.

SUSIE
Is this legal? Are they allowed to do
that? Can the cops just give up?!

HOLLY shrugs.

HOLLY
{matter of fact)
They gave up on me.

SUSIE turns away, frowning. A sharp wind rises, blowing scraps of
litter across the GAZEBO.

SUSIE (0.S8.)
I had always assumed Mr. Harvey would
be caught and that he would be
punished. I wanted him to suffer as
my family had suffered. I wanted him
to lose what he had taken from me!

INT. JACK’S STUDY - NIGHT 159
A strong wind rattles the windows ...

CLOSE ON: JACK is alone, defeated, thumbing through SUSIE’S

SUDDEN CUT: JACK spins in front of the MIRROR, swinging a MAGNUM
PISTOL into FOREGROUND ... he squeezes the TRIGGER:

Flow by The Bellamy Brothers :

EXT. HEAVEN/CORNFIELD - DAY 160

TRACKING: MR. HARVEY is running through the CORN ... he looks
FEARFULLY over his SHOULDER, as if being PURSUED.

MR. HARVEY throws a look back ... SUDDENLY, THUD! He runs
straight into JACK, bouncing off his chest and sprawling back on
the GROUND.

LET YOUR LOVE FLOW
There's a reason for the sunshine
sky; And there's a reason why I'm
feelin' so high;

JACK raises his MAGNUM PISTOL ...
LET YOUR LOVE FLOW (CONT’D)

Must be the season; When that love

ice-cream in the GAZEBO.

IMAGES: JACK, with bullet BELTS over both shoulders, and holding
a ,nange MACHINE GUN stalks MR. HARVEY through a FILM NOIR

SUSIE (V.0.)
That's what you see in the movies,
that’s what happens in books. An
ordinary guy gets a gun or a knife
and stalks the murderer of his family
and does a Bronson on them and
everyone cheers!

BANG! BANG! BANG! MR. HARVEY is riddled with BULLETS!
SUSIE CHEERS her DAD!

LET YOUR LOVE FLOW
So let that feeling grab you deep
inside; And send you reeling
where your love can't hide;

IMAGES: JACK throwing KNIVES at MR. HARVEY ... swinging a CHAIN
SAW ... then a MACHETE ... throwing a HAND GRENADE, jumbled with
IMAGES of MR. HARVEY SCREAMING, blood spurting!

LET YOUR LOVE FLOW (CONT'D)
Just let your love flow like a
mountain stream ...
And let “oUt love bind you to all
living things ...

As MR. HARVEY sprawls across the GAZEBO.

SUSIE
I’m gonna nail him, Holly!

HOLLY
No, you‘re not.

SUSIE
He's going down! He’s not gonna tap
dance his way out of this! Not as
long as I‘m around.

HOLLY
You’re not around.

SUSIE
Dad‘s almost there - he just needs a
nudge in the right direction.

SUSIE and HOLLY’S ARGUMENT is surrounded and interrupted by

HOLLY
You can’t interfere with things on
earth!

IMAGE: JACK in a CRANE, swings a huge WRECKING BALL, splattering
MR. HARVEY against his FRONT DOOR, bringing the front of his
HOUSE crashing down.

ANGLE ON: HOLLY and SUSIE in the GAZEBO as the wreckage of MR.
HARVEY’S HOUSE floats down around them.

HOLLY (CONT’D)
I guess that‘s that then.

HOLLY reaches into her pocket and PULLS out a folded piece of
PAPER ... which she hands to SUSIE.

HOLLY (CONT’D)
I'm supposed to give you this.

SUSIE opens the piece of paper +++ but there is nothing written
on it. She looks puzzled and lets it flutter to the ground as
HOLLY walks away.

suddenly starts to MIS-FIRE.

SAMUEL
Looks like we‘re walking ...

SAMUEL stops the BIKE and they climb off. LINDSEY is confused
when he pulls off his HELMET and takes her hand.

the GAZEBO ROOF.

MRS. SINGH
Are the police any closer to making
an arrest?

JACK
No...
{lowering voice)
But I have a father’s suspicion.

MRS. SINGH
You are wise to listen to your
instincts. If it were me ... if I
knew who did it ... I would find a
quiet way to meet this person ... I
would take the matter in to my own
hands and ...

MRS SINGH leans close to JACK.

MRS. SINGH (CONT'D)
+++ I would kill him.

EXT. WOODLANDS - DAY 167

SAMUEL and LINDSEY are muddy and DRENCHED, as they PUSH through

PORCH; the DOOR swings open ... DIM LIGHT streams in to a LARGE
WHITE-WASHED ENTRANCE HALL.

She wanders from room to room ... Each room is full of infinite

A FLASH of LIGHTNING rips through the air outside.

SAMUEL (CONT'D)
What do you think?

LINDSEY turns to SAMUEL ... his face is full of expectation. She
looks at SAMUEL with infinite sadness ...

LINDSEY

ANGLE ON: JACK is hurrying home during a pause in the RAIN ... as
he passes the GILBERT HOUSE, HOLIDAY starts whining and pulling
at the LEASH.

MR. GILBERT and his daughter TESSA are searching his GARDEN, not
paying attention to JACK ... MR. GILBERT is clearly PRE-OCCUPIED,
searching for their LOST CAT.
MR GILBERT

Lilly! Where are you, girl?

TESSA
Lil-leeeee!

and DISTORTED by the GAZEBO IMAGE ... she quietly WHIMPERS in
SHOCK ...

EXT. MR. HARVEY'S HOUSE - DAY 172

You don’t know when to stop, do you?

ANGLE ON: MR. HARVEY looks up, slightly alarmed.

JACK SALMON is walking towards him, a bunch of the SAPLINGS under
one arm.

JACK (CONT'D)
Gotta keep your hands busy even in
your leisure time.

JACK dumps the SAPLINGS as MR. HARVEY flashes a brief,
unconvincing smile.

JACK (CONT’D)
What are you building?

MR. HARVEY freezes as JACK catches sight of a HALF BUILT
STRUCTURE in the BACKYARD.

MR. HARVEY
It‘s a ceremonial structure. I saw it
on television.

JACK wanders over for a better LOOK.

JACK
What’s it for exactly?

MR HARVEY scuttles over and resumes working on the TENT.

MR. HARVEY
My amusement.

He struggles to bend a ROD into an ARCH. JACK drops down beside
h;

JACK
Here ... you stake it, I’1l lash.

MR HARVEY
Mr. Salmon, you really needn‘t -

JACK
(insistent)
It‘s no trouble.

MR. HARVEY thinks better of it and decides to back down.

handiwork ... glancing up as BLACK CLOUDS gather in the skies.

JACK (CONT'D)
Looks like the weather has turned.

without a word.

On the SOUNDTRACK: Look at Me by John Lennon:

JACK stares at the FACELESS WINDOWS which are hidden behind MR

NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH sign on the FRONT DOOR ... JACK’S EYES stray
to the DEAD GERANIUM BUSH...

Behind him, the BACK DOOR slowly opens ... MR. HARVEY'S EYES
visible through the dark FLY SCREEN.

in the PALM of her hand.

EXT. MR. HARVEY‘S HOUSE - DAY 179
ANGLE ON: JACK, seemingly lost in a dream ...

Mr. Salmon?

JACK appears to come to.

MR. HARVEY (cont’d) (CONT'D)
I never had a chance to tell you...
I’m sorry for your loss.

JACK
(awkward)
Thanks.

At that moment: the SOUND of a FAINT clock ALARM from within MR.
HARVEY'S HOUSE.

MR. HARVEY looks momentarily confused ... then he slowly goes to
his MAIL BOX and removes JUNK MAIL, thumbing through it as if it
has some importance.

The incessant BEEPING ALARM. MR. HARVEY is slightly flustered.
SUSIE (V.0O.)

MR. HARVEY winces as a SNOWFLAKE brushes past his CHEEK.

181 EXT. MR. HARVEY’S HOUSE - DAY 181

JACK stares at the DEAD GERANIUM in his HAND ... in his mind's
eye, the BROWN PETALS flex and curl into a cluster of little
BUDS; the WITHERED STEM swells green with life ... and all at
once the GERANIUM bursts into flower - an impossible BLOOD RED
BLOOM.

A SINGLE SNOWFLAKE falls on JACK ... melting on his cheek like a
TEARDROP. The FLOWER slips from JACK’S HAND ...

--- MR. HARVEY watches the DEAD GERANIUM land at JACK’S FEET. He
slowly raises his eyes to meets JACK’S knowing gaze.

MR. HARVEY and JACK look at each other ... neither bothers to
hide what they know to be the truth.

MR. HARVEY
I think you should go home now, Mr.
Salmon.

ANGLE ON: JACK incredulous ... uncomprehending as the realization
dawns that MR. HARVEY killed his DAUGHTER.

JACK

Susie ...

ANGLE ON: HOLIDAY starting to WHIMPER ...

MR. HARVEY
Go on home.

JACK

Why?

JACK lurches forward as MR. HARVEY suddenly turns and makes a
beeline for the safety of his house.

SNOW is falling in thick fat drops.
ANGLE ON: HOLIDAY straining on the leash, growling ...
JACK (cont‘d) (CONT'D)
(shouting)
Why??22?

JACK blunders after MR. HARVEY, HOLIDAY snarling and snapping on
the lead.

Near the FRONT PORCH, MR. HARVEY turns ...
MR. HARVEY

LINDSEY

Dad? Dad!

GRANDMA LYNN

BRIAN NELSON leaps onto JACK, dragging him off CLARISSA. JACK is
stunned, confused ... BRIAN swings the TORCH, hitting JACK in the
HEAD. JACK CRIES OUT as BRIAN hits him again in the FACE!

MR. HARVEY for one brief second.

would be met with a questioning
stare.

MR. HARVEY and the FEMALE TEACHER exchange soundless pleasantries
as SUSIE'S VOICE OVER continues ...

SUSIE (V.0.) geont’>.
He would tell stories of true love,
widowhood and tragic loss. It was
luscious food to a middle aged

nodding and smiling as he pictured

PHOTO of benign MR. HARVEY.

SUSIE
Do you know Holly?

FLORA
Did she give you a map to this place?

pushing the SAFE towards the HOLE...

SUSIE (V.0.)

bland man. The kind of man who is
easily pitied and sometimes scorned
++. but never blamed. This was the
face he showed to the world. I saw
another ...

ANGLE ON: MR. HARVEY looks up and appears to stare directly at
SUSIE ... but he sees only RUTH.

Horror is real. It is every day. It

be contained.

Say it! I need to hear you say it!

CLOSE ON: RUTH stumbles ... as she is BLASTED by a SUDDEN IMAGE
of SUSIE.

SHOCKING, VIOLENT ... it’s the same IMAGE that hit her all those
years EARLIER.

EXCEPT this time, SUSIE’S HAND doesn't brush past RUTH’S ARM - it
GRABS her ARM and SPINS her ROUND!

ANGLE ON: RUTH slumps to the GROUND in a FAINT. RAY leans over
her, worried.

RAY
Ruth ... can you hear me? Ruth?

CLOSE ON: RUTH lifts her FACE ... there is something different
about her ...

What RAY sees is RUTH, what the AUDIENCE see is SUSIE.
SUSIE

Ray - he’s here. He’s going to bury
me.

the light ...

I had been granted a moment of grace...

SUSIE (CONT’D)
Ray -
RAY
What is it? What‘s the matter?

SUSIE (V.O.)
But it was beginning to fade...

SUSIE looks into RAY‘S EYES. She has a choice - she could tell
him about the SAFE ... her BODY ... her KILLER.

SUSIE (CONT’D)
Ray ...

«+. she HESITATES.
SUSIE (CONT’D)
kiss ‘gos?
RAY lips slowly touch SUSIE’S, with a gentle tenderness.

As they part, TEARS well up in SUSIE'S EYES ... a teardrop
trickles down her face. RAY gently brushes away the TEARDROPS.

RAY
(gently)
Don‘t cry ... Susie?

RAY pauses realizing what he has just said. He looks into SUSIE’S
EYES.

SUSIE
You wrote me a note once. You called
yourself the Moor.

RAY sees SUSIE for the first time: a FRAGILE IMAGE like a
fragment of MEMORY from an earlier time.

RAY
(whispered)
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon...
INSERT: the SAFE tumbles into DARKNESS ...
RAY leans toward SUSIE ... and softly kisses her again.

The SCREEN radiates into brilliant WHITE.

LATER:

SLOW MOTION: ABIGAIL shakes a billowing sheet over SUSIE’S BED
