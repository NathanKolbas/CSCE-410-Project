FADE IN:
EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- NIGHT

It is a plain building with a sign that reads Federal Bureau
Of Investigations, Dallas Branch. There are only a few cars
parked in the parking lot, including an ambulance.

INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

A MAN sits in the lobby flipping mindlessly through a
paperback book, his face unseen. There is no one else in
the lobby except for the OPERATOR behind her desk.

OPERATOR
(into the phone)
This is my third double shift this
month...I know, I know, but the only
other operator is out sick...I think
She's on drugs...Well her boyfriend
is DEA you know...

AGENT RANDY HULL comes into the lobby and motions to the
man. He gets up and walks toward Hull, stopping at the
operator's desk. The operator looks up at him.

OPERATOR (CONT'D)
{into phone)
Hold on.
(to the man)
Yes?

He puts the paperback on her desk and slides it toward her.
She looks at the book and then up at him.

MAN
I found it on the seat over there.
Someone must have left it behind.

She nods with a smile, and picks up the book. As he walks
off, she looks at the back of it and goes back to ‘her phone
call. He walks over to Agent Hull, and they shake hands.
INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Hull stands in the doorway facing the man, but we still don't
see the his face.

HULL

You can wait in here. You need
anything? Water? Coffee?

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

MAN
No I'm fine. Thanks.

HULL
It shouldn't be long.

Hull leaves, shutting the door behind him. The man looks
around the small office, noticing all the details: the walls
are covered with framed citations, official plaques, and
several framed newspaper articles on the capture of various
serial killers. There are several gory police photographs
from case files taped on the side of a filing cabinet.

The man wanders over to the desk which is littered with
papers, pens, a few more case file photos, and one framed
eight by ten glossy color photograph of a MAN in his twenties
standing next to a WOMAN in her late forties with graying
brown hair. The man reaches for the photograph.

EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- LATER

A car pulls into the parking lot, and AGENT WILLIAM DOYLE
gets out. He is the man from the photograph except he is
older now in his mid-thirties and has a hard, world-weary
yet powerful look to him. He looks at the ambulance as he
walks up the little concrete path to the building. Thunder
rumbles off in the distance.

INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

Doyle walks into the reception area, where the operator is
reading the paperback.

DOYLE
What's that ambulance doing out there?

The operator glances up from her book, shrugs, and goes back
to reading. He frowns at her, and exits into the main office
where there are several lines of cubicles that are mostly
empty except for one or two. Along the walls of the room
are enclosed offices with large glass windows. He strides
down the hall. All of the offices are dark except for one.
Doyle looks at the lit office window and sees the back of a
man's head sitting inside. Hull sits at one of the desk
cubicles. He looks up at Doyle from his computer.

HULL
Hello sir.

DOYLE
Hey Randy, how you tonight?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HULL
Can't complain. Is it raining out
yet?

DOYLE

Not yet. A big storm's coming though.
I can smell it in the air.

(nods toward the office)
That him?

HULL
Yep. Been here about an hour. Said
he'd only talk to you.

DOYLE
He asked for me by name?

HULL
Nope. Asked for the agent in charge
of the God's Hand case.

Doyle nods, still staring at the back of the man's head.

HULL (CONT'D)
Said he had some important info on
it.

DOYLE
Didn't say what?

HULL
Nope. Said he'd only talk to you.
Might just be some crackpot but I
figured I should call you anyway.

DOYLE
With six murders and no substantial
clues, anything's worth a shot at
this point.

HULL
Well if anyone can crack this case.
it's you sir.

DOYLE
(deadpan)
What's that on your nose Randy?

HULL
(touches his nose)
Huh?

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

DOYLE
Looks a little brown from here.

Hull gets it.
DOYLE (CONT'D)
If you want that promotion, you give
me hard work not a wet ass. You
read me?

HULL
Yes sir.

Doyle looks at the back of Fenton's head behind the window.

DOYLE
Well, I'd better get to it.

Doyle walks off toward the office. Hull goes back to work.
INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Doyle comes in. The man, FENTON MEEKS, looks up at him from
his chair by the door, but doesn't get up. This is the first

time we actually see his face. He is in his late twenties,
with an easy smile and bright blue eyes.

FENTON
You the agent in charge of the God's
Hand case?
DOYLE
(nods)

Agent William Doyle.

He extends his hand to Fenton, but Fenton looks down at the
framed picture in his hands, ignoring Doyle's gesture.

FENTON
(looking at the picture)
Is this you and your mother?

Doyle sees the picture he's holding, the one of him and the
woman, and snatches it out of his hands.

DOYLE
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
take things off my desk.

Doyle crosses the little office and puts the picture back on
his desk facing him.

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

FENTON
Sorry about that. I've been in here
™, for awhile. I've already read all
ae your plaques and citations. And I

didn't care to look at those.

Fenton indicates the case file photos. Doyle sits down at
his desk and regains his composure.

FENTON (CONT'D)
Quite impressive, the plaques I mean.

DOYLE
I'm good at what I do.
FENTON
You must be.
DOYLE
So what can I do for you, Mr...
FENTON
Fenton Meeks. I have some information

for you.
Doyle just looks at him, waiting for him to continue.
FENTON (CONT'D)

This may sound crazy, but... I know
who the God's Hand killer is.

 

Doyle stares at him flatly, but he doesn't continue. They
stare at each other for a moment.

DOYLE
Alright, I'll bite. Who?

FENTON
You haven't even heard me out yet,
and already you doubt me. Why?

DOYLE
Because in a case like this no one
just walks into your office and tells
you who the killer is. It doesn't
work that way. .

FENTON

Sometimes truth defies reason Agent
Doyle.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

DOYLE
Yeah? That's pretty good. Youa
philosopher Mr. Meeks?

FENTON
No. A novelist.

DOYLE
That right?

FENTON _.
Well, a pulp novelist really. Crime
fiction.
DOYLE
Uh huh, well everybody's got to have
a job. So let's get back to mine
for a moment. Who is it?
They stare at each other for a moment.

FENTON
My brother.

Doyle waits for him to continue, but he doesn't.

DOYLE
How do you know that?

FENTON
I got a call from him last night...

CUT TO FLASHBACK:
EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
It is a small frame house. There is a van and a car parked
in the driveway. All the lights to the house are off except
for a dim light in the front window. Johnny Cash's Peace in
the Valley plays softly from inside the house.

INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

ADAM MEEKS, in his late twenties, sits at a small desk in
the far corner of the living room with his eyes closed. The
song plays on an old record player. He hums along with it.
On the desk is an old typewriter, a gun, and two stacks of
paper. In one hand Adam holds a half empty bottle of Jim
Beam, and in his-other hand is a picture. It is a faded
color photograph of a man, DAD, and two boys, FENTON AGE
TWELVE and ADAM AGE NINE. He opens his eyes and sings to it
for a moment and then suddenly throws it to the floor.

(CONTINUED)
(

 

 

CONTINUED:

He takes a drink from the bottle and looks thoughtfully at a
piece of paper taped on the wall in front of the desk. It

is a list of seven names with six of them crossed out. Taped
next to the list are newspaper clippings. One of the
headlines reads: GOD'S HAND CLAIMS 6TH VICTIM. He gets up,
stumbles over to the phone, picks it up, and dials.

INT. FENTON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Fenton sits on the couch in the darkened living room, sipping
a beer and watching television. The phone rings. Fenton ..
reaches over and picks it up on the second ring.

FENTON
(into phone)
Hello.

There is a long pause. Fenton is about to hang up when...

ADAM
Demons are taking over the world.

INTERCUT BETWEEN FENTON AND ADAM:

FENTON
Adam? Is that you? What...

ADAM
I can't take it anymore Fenton. I
can't destroy them all. They're
everywhere.

FENTON
Adam, we need to talk about this...

ADAM
There's nothing to talk about.
Whatever happens, you have to take i
me to the rose garden. You promised. i
Remember? |

FENTON
I'm on my way over, alright?

The line goes dead.

FENTON (CONT'D)
Adam? Adam!? Damn it! .

He slams the phone down and gets up.
 

 

%,

INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Adam goes back to his desk and sits down. He drinks the
rest of the bottle and picks up the gun, holds it to his
head for a moment, and then pulls the trigger. A WOMAN lets
out a startled cry from down the hall. The song ends.

INT. FENTON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Fenton walks down the hall and looks into the bedroom where
a@ woman, MARY, is asleep in bed with her back to him. He
looks at the back of her blonde head for a moment and then
sighs. He quietly goes to the dresser next to the door,
opens a drawer and takes out a handgun. He stares at it for
a moment, then shuts the drawer, grabs his car keys off the
top of the dresser next to the door, and hurries out.

INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- LATER

Adam's corpse is laying half in the chair and half on the
floor. Adam's GIRLFRIEND is on her knees, holding onto him,
crying. A police officer, HENDERSON, is kneeling beside
her, trying to coax her away from Adam's body.

HENDERSON
(softly)
C'mon ma'am. He's gone. C'mon now...

GIRLFRIEND
(crying)
Oh Adaaaam...

Henderson uncomfortably looks up for help and sees the two
paramedics MATT, and HUBERT come in carrying a stretcher.
They wait for Henderson to take her away. Matt is clean cut
in his mid-twenties. He looks around awkwardly, trying not
to look at the woman. Hubert is fat and frumpy in his late
thirties, and is staring straight at her. He can see her
breasts dangling in her over-sized nightgown perfectly from
where he stands.

ANGLE ON HER BREASTS

The image is broken as Henderson gets her on her feet and
leads her to another OFFICER who takes her out to the porch.
Henderson nods at Matt and Hubert. They unfold their
stretcher and put Adam's body on it. Matt pulls a sheet
over him. They all stand and regard the covered body.

HUBERT

Think the Cowboys'll make it to the
superbowl this year?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

HENDERSON
Well hell yeah,

SU MATT
{looking at the chair)
You guys didn't chalk him?

HENDERSON
What's the point? That's for a crime
scene.
MATT ~-
Well isn't this a...
HENDERSON
(impatiently)

The gun was in his hand.. There's
nothing to investigate.

(to Hubert)
You boys take him on over to the
morgue in Abilene. Tell Ed I'll be
over directly to fill out the

paperwork.
Hubert nods.
MATT
fs Aren't you supposed to escort us?

a Henderson looks at. Hubert who shrugs.

HUBERT
He's new.

INT. FENTON'S CAR - NIGHT

Fenton drives down Adam's street. He sees the ambulance and
police cars in front of Adam's house. He turns off his lights
and parks down the street. He sees the Girlfriend on the
porch, crying, and the paramedics loading the stretcher into
the ambulance. He punches his steering wheel.

FENTON
(upset)
Oh goddamnit Adam! Goddamnit!
INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

Hubert climbs into the driver's side as Matt gets in on the
passenger side and buckles up. Hubert starts the engine and

puts it in gear.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MATT
Shouldn't you buckle up?

Hubert looks at him, rolls his eyes, and punches the gas.
INT. FENTON'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Fenton watches the ambulance drive off. He wipes at his
tears, and pulls out after the ambulance.

EXT. HIGHWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
The ambulance gets on the highway, followed by Fenton's car.
INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

Hubert and Matt drive along in silence. Hubert's eyes are
half glazed in thought as he drives.

INSERT: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hubert is looking at the Girlfriend's breasts. It's the
same scene as before except Henderson and Matt aren't there.

He walks up to her, pulls her up from Adam's corpse, and
kisses her, grabbing one of her breasts.

MATT (0.S.)
Jesus look out!

BACK TO SCENE:

Hubert snaps to and steers the ambulance back into the lane.
A car drives by honking and the DRIVER gives them the finger.

HUBERT
Yeah, fuck you too buddy.

MATT
You almost ran him off the road!

Hubert sees a big shining Texaco sign up ahead. He puts on
the blinker.

MATT (CONT'D)
What are you doing now? This isn't
the exit.

HUBERT
Gotta take a piss.

: MATT
I don't believe this shit.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HUBERT

Well believe it.
MATT

Man, this is against regulations.
HUBERT

Look we got us a dead guy back there

right?
MATT

Yeah but... ~
HUBERT

And that dead guy is still gonna be
dead whether I stop or not right?

MATT
Yeah man but...

HUBERT
But nothing. I'm stopping.

EXT. TEXACO STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

The ambulance pulls into the parking lot and parks by the
pumps. Hubert kills the engine and gets out.

HUBERT
I'll be back in a few minutes.

He leans into the window.

HUBERT (CONT'D)
Lighten up kid this ain't necessarily
against the rules.

He walks off.

MATT
(watching him go)
Asshole.

HUBERT
(walking away)
Dipshit.

Hubert waves at the attendant and then disappears to the
side of the gas station. Fenton's car pulls in, it's
headlights shining on Hubert as he opens the bathroom door.
 

INT. TEXACO RESTROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Hubert enters, locks the door behind him, walks up to the
urinal and unzips his pants. He closes his eyes, and it is
obvious that he is doing something other than peeing.

INT. FENTON'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

He is parked right outside of the restroom doors. He sits
for a moment, thinking, then leans over, opens the glove
compartment, and takes out the gun. He checks the chamber
and gets out of the car.

INT. AMBULANCE -~- CONTINUOUS

Matt looks back at the shadow of the corpse, and then at the
side of the Texaco and frowns.

INT. TEXACO RESTROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Hubert continues to "relieve" himself.

EXT. TEXACO RESTROOM ~-- CONTINUOUS

Fenton checks the restroom door: it's locked. He looks around
nervously, positions his gun, and kicks the door open. He
sees Hubert. Hubert sees him. They both freeze: Fenton

with his gun in his hand, and Hubert with his dick in his
hand.

INT. AMBULANCE -~ CONTINUOUS

Matt lights a cigarette, and watches a pretty young GIRL
pump gas into her car.

INT. TEXACO RESTROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Hubert faces the wall with his hands behind his head. Fenton
stands behind him with the gun.

HUBERT
I know what this must look like but...

Fenton hits him with the butt of the gun and he falls
unconscious on the bathroom floor. Fenton peels off Hubert's
white paramedic shirt from him.

EXT. TEXACO RESTROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Fenton puts Hubert in the trunk of his car, and shuts it.

INT. AMBULANCE -- MOMENTS LATER

Matt watches the girl put the gas nozzle back. She notices
him and smiles. As he smiles back Fenton walks up, gets
into the ambulance and starts it up. Matt glances over at
him, but turns back to the girl.

MATT
Well it’s about time. You've been
in there long en...

Fenton slams the ambulance into gear and hits the gas. The
ambulance squeals out of the parking lot, hits the curb as
it gets back on the access road, and causes a car to swerve
into a telephone pole. Matt sticks his head out the window
to see the MAN from the crashed car screaming and waving his
arms after them.

MATT (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ! Did you even see him?

He pulls his head back in the ambulance and turns to Fenton.

MATT (CONT'D)
You just caused a wreck you stupid...

His speech is cut off by Fenton's face.

MATT (CONT'D)
What the...Who the fuck...

His speech is cut off again by Fenton's gun in his face.
CUT TO PRESENT:
INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Doyle sits at his desk, looking at Fenton carefully. Fenton
just sits, looking blankly back at Doyle.

DOYLE
And where is this paramedic now?

FENTON
(shrugs)
I dropped him off here in Dallas .
last night on my way to Tyler. Hell
of a guy. He's probably back in
Meat by now.

DOYLE
Meat?

CONTINUED:

FENTON
Where all this took place. About
200 miles west of here. Just north

 

of Abilene.
‘

DOYLE
Why did you go to Tyler?

FENTON
To bury Adam in the Rose Garden.

DOYLE ~
And why would you do that?

FENTON
I promised him I would a long time

ago.
Doyle rubs the back of his neck, still looking at Fenton.

DOYLE
I've got a lot of problems with what
you've just told me. But I'll just
lay out the two major ones for you.
First of all you're describing events
that you couldn't have possibly
witnessed.

(4 FENTON
~ I described the suicide and the
ambulance driver's reasons for
stopping as I imagined them to be.

DOYLE
You've got a pretty sick imagination.

FENTON
(shrugs)

Maybe, but the facts remain that my
brother did call and he did kill |
himself. And the ambulance driver |
did stop, and I did catch him going
at it like a thirteen year old boy
in that bathroom. I filled in the
blanks with my imagination and from
what Matt told me.

 

DOYLE
Matt? The paramedic?

Fenton nods.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

 

CONTINUED:

DOYLE (CONT'D)
And where's your brother's body now?

FENTON
Buried in the Tyler Rose Garden.

DOYLE
And you did all this because of some
promise you made?

FENTON
Yep.

DOYLE
That's a pretty wild story Mr. Meeks.

FENTON
It's the truth.

Doyle looks at him and frowns.

DOYLE
My other problem with this little
tale of yours is I can't see what,
if anything, it has to do with my
case.

FENTON
Adam was the God's hand killer.
He's the one you're looking for.

DOYLE
Uh-huh. He tell you that before he
asked you to take him to Tyler? If
so, you left that part out.

FENTON
I haven't finished.

DOYLE
Oh there's more?

FENTON
A lot more.

Doyle stares at him for a long moment, and then suddenly
stands and smiles coldly at him.

DOYLE
Excuse me for a moment.

FENTON
Of course.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
He crosses the office and exits.
INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

Doyle shuts his office door behind him and looks back through
the window at Fenton. He walks down to Hull's cubicle where
he's still working on his computer. The place is even emptier
and darker than before.

DOYLE
Hey Randy. Do me a favor and watch
my office for awhile.

HULL
What's up?

DOYLE .
Might be a crackpot after all. Just
keep an eye on him for me.

HULL
Yes sir.

Doyle takes off down the hall. Hull looks over at the back
of Fenton's head through the window.

EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- MOMENTS LATER

Doyle walks out to the ambulance, puts on latex gloves, and
tries the door. It's unlocked. He opens the door and looks
inside. A white paramedic's shirt lays in the passenger
seat. There is nothing in the back except for a stretcher.
He opens the glove compartment and sees the gun. He takes
it out, and checks to see if it's loaded: it is. He sniffs
the barrel, puts it back in the glove, and shuts the door.
BA bolt of lightning lights up the sky as he walks away.

INT. FBI OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Doyle sits in front of a computer. He picks up the phone
next to him and dials a number from the screen.

INT. MEAT POLICE DEPARTMENT ~- CONTINUOUS

A pregnant blonde WOMAN sits at the front desk, reading a
magazine. The phone rings. She ignores the phone and keeps
reading, but picks it up on the third ring. .

WOMAN

INTERCUT BETWEEN WOMAN AND DOYLE.

DOYLE
Yes, may I speak to the chief of
police there please? This is Agent
William Doyle of the FBI.

 

WOMAN
He's not here right now, may I help
you?
DOYLE ~

Well, I've got a man here in my office
by the name of Fenton Meeks that...

WOMAN
Fenton Meeks? What's he doing there?

DOYLE
(confused)
You know him?

WOMAN
Yeah, he caused a bit of a ruckus
here, stole an ambulance and the
paramedic too.

e DOYLE
( ‘ You already know about it?

WOMAN
Well, yeah. Do you?

DOYLE
He just confessed it to me.

WOMAN

Hell of a thing, huh? Matt, that's
the paramedic, told us all about it.
Just got back into town about an
hour ago.

(laughs)
Sounds like Mr. Meeks kind of caught
Hubert with his pants down. The
sheriff left not twenty minutes ago
to let him out of that trunk.

Doyle just sits there, thinking. There is a long pause.

WOMAN (CONT'D)
Hey. You still there?

He snaps out of it.

(CONTINUED)
 

L$.

 

CONTINUED:
DOYLE
Yeah. I'm going to detain him awhile
here for questioning and then I'll
have an agent bring him back to you.
WOMAN
Ah there's no need for that. Just
tell him to bring the ambulance back.
DOYLE
What!? You're not going to charge
him?
WOMAN
With what?
DOYLE
How about theft, assault,
kidnapping...
WOMAN

Matt doesn't want to press charges.
And I doubt Hubert'1l want to from
what Matt told us. And it was just
an ambulance, though it is our only
one. As long as he brings it back
the sheriff said they'll be no
charges. Tell him that will you?

 

DOYLE
But he stole a corpse!

WOMAN
Yeah, but it was his brother Agent
Doyle. We've all done some crazy
things when family's involved. But
he'll need to bring him back too.
Make sure you tell him that, okay?

DOYLE

I don't believe this crap.
WOMAN

Excuse me?
DOYLE

Nothing. I'1l tell him.

Doyle hangs up the phone incredulously.
INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS ~- MOMENTS LATER

Doyle walks quickly toward his office, lost in thought.
Hull sees him.

HULL
He's still in there, sir.

DOYLE
Huh? Oh, oh yeah. Thanks.

He keeps walking.

HULL
Everything alright? Want me to come
in there with you?

DOYLE
What? No, no. Everything's fine.

He opens his office door.
INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
Doyle comes in. Fenton is still sitting in his chair.

FENTON
Did my story check out?

Doyle frowns at him, but nods.

FENTON (CONT'D)
So am I under arrest now?

Doyle crosses to his desk and sits down.

DOYLE
You should be, but apparently the
sheriff there is willing to forgive
and forget as long as you bring the
body and the ambulance back. No one
wants to press charges.

FENTON
(smiles)
You've got to love smail towns.

DOYLE
Well, I'm not so sure the authorities
in Tyler will feel the same way about
you burying your brother in their
public garden.

(CONTINUED)

 
 

 

CONTINUED:

20.

FENTON
Probably not.

DOYLE
You know I get the distinct impression
that you're playing some kind of
game here with me.

FENTON
Why is that?

DOYLE
Why would you go through all that
trouble and then just walk in here
and confess it to me?

FENTON
I did it because I promised Adam I
would. I'm here because I can't
live with what I know anymore.

DOYLE
And what exactly do you know?

Fenton nods to the picture of him and the woman.

FENTON
That is your mother, isn't it?

Doyle glances at the picture and then looks at Fenton for a
long moment, sizing him up.

DOYLE
Yes it is.
FENTON
I knew it. You can tell by the eyes.
DOYLE
Why are you so interested in my
picture?
FENTON

Curiosity I guess. It's the only
personal picture you have in here.
No family portraits, no snapshots of
kids, just that one. Why is that?

DOYLE

I don't have a wife or kid. I'm too
busy for that.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

 

 

CONTINUED:

FENTON
Why not a more recent one of your
mother then?

Doyle looks at the picture for a long moment, a trace of
sadness in his expression.

DOYLE
My mother... died just a few weeks
after this picture was taken.

FENTON
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

DOYLE
Yeah, well why don't we get back to
your story. Why do you think your
brother was the God's Hand killer?

FENTON
I know it was him.

DOYLE
How?

FENTON

It started back in Tyler near the
summer of seventy-nine...

CUT TO FLASHBACK:
EXT. TYLER 1979 -- DAY

It is a beautiful, sunny day. The townspeople go slowly
about their business, nodding or waving at one another as
they pass. A little yellow school bus goes down the street
and pulls over. Children burst out of the bus door. Two
boys, ADAM AGE NINE and FENTON AGE TWELVE, break away from
the rest of the children and walk away from the town. The
resemblance between them is apparent, though Fenton is taller.

ADAM
(sings)
I got the joy joy joy joy down in my
heart!
He looks to Fenton and frowns.

ADAM (CONT'D)
You're supposed to say where.

FENTON
I don't want to sing that dumb song.

They turn down a road with a big banner hanging across it
that reads, "Tyler Rose Garden”.

EXT. TYLER ROSE GARDEN -~ MOMENTS LATER

They walk down a little cement path that runs through the
huge and sprawling gardens. .

FENTON (V.0.)

We lived right behind the Tyler
Municipal Rose Garden...

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

Every rose imaginable is in bloom around them. Adam chases
a butterfly as he sings his song. They walk off the path to
a wire fence at the back of the garden. On the other side
of the fence is a small graveled road that runs from around
the garden to an old wood and brick house.

FENTON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
.in the house where they used to
keep the gardeners back in the
fifties. Dad got a good deal on it
back when he and mom got married.

They climb the fence and head toward the house.
INT. HOUSE -- LATER

Adam sits on the floor in the living room watching Banana
Splits on television.

FENTON (V.0.)
Adam was three years younger than
me. Our mom died giving birth to
him so I basically took care of him
ever since I can remember.

Fenton is in the kitchen, preparing dinner.

FENTON (V.0.) (CONT'D
Our dad worked as a mechanic over in
Chandler at a Ford dealership. He
usually got home around five thirty
and we'd all have dinner together.

DAD comes into the kitchen. It is the same man from the
picture in Adam's suicide scene. He is in his mid-to-late
forties with thinning dark hair. He puts his lunchbox down
on the table and smiles at Fenton.

DAD
Hey kiddo. Something sure smells
good.

INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Adam, Fenton, and Dad all sit around the kitchen table,
putting food on their plates from various bowls and plates.
Adam piles peas on his plate.

DAD

(to Adam)
Whoa there tiger. Save some for us.

ADAM
I love peas!

DAD
{laughs)
You must.

Dad takes the bowl from him and puts it back on the table.

DAD (CONT'D)
Better be careful though. You might -
turn into one if you're not careful.

Adam giggles and puts a big spoonful of peas in his mouth.

DAD (CONT'D)
(to Fenton)
So how'd you do on that math test?

FENTON
(looks down)
I barely passed.

DAD
I never was any good at math either.
Shoot, I still can't do anything
without a calculator.

FENTON
But I've got another test next week,
and it's going to.be even harder.

DAD
Oh don't sound so gloomy about it.
We'll sit down this weekend and see
if we can't figure that junk out
together, alright?

Fenton smiles at him and nods.
INT. BEDROOM -- LATER

There are two single beds with a little nightstand between
them. On Adam's side of the room there is a Pete's Dragon
poster and a toy box. There is a Farah Fawcett poster and
one of the Dallas Cowboy's 1978 team on Fenton's side. Adam
is already laying in his bed, playing with a couple of Star
Wars figures. Fenton changes into his bed clothes.

ADAM

Hey Fenton, can we go see Meatballs
after school tomorrow?

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:
Fenton climbs into bed.

FENTON
You've already seen it.

ADAM
I want to see it again.

FENTON
We're going to see Alien.

ADAM
We can't. It's rated R.

Dad comes in.

DAD
Teeth all brushed?

They both nod.

DAD (CONT'D)
You sure about that Adam?

Adam nods emphatically. Dad goes to his bed and leans down.

DAD (CONT'D)
Come on. Breath test time.

Adam breathes on him. He cringes dramatically and falls on
the bed as if he has died. Fenton breaks up laughing. Adam
shakes Dad.

ADAM
I did brush them!

Dad opens his eyes and laughs. He lifts up and puts an arm
around Adam.

DAD
I'm just yolking with you egghead.

He gives him a squeeze, and kisses him on the forehead. He
stands and looks over at Fenton, who rolis over.

DAD (CONT'D)
Don't worry Fenton. I know you're
too big for a goodnight kiss.

Fenton rolls back over and smiles at him. He reaches down
and tousles Fenton's hair. He clicks off the lamp between
the beds. A night-light still shines next to the lamp on
the wall. Dad sees it.

No I don’t. You do.

I don't like it too dark.
DAD

That's right. Love you.

ADAM

Too bad.

ADAM
Please.

FENTON
(sighs)
Alright. Just go to bed.

Adam smiles and lays back down. Fenton lays there staring
up at the ceiling, slowly drifting off.

FENTON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
That was our family. Just the three
of us. All of Mom and Dad's relatives
had died off. There was no one but
us left. We didn't mind though. We
didn't need anyone else. We were
happy together...

He closes his eyes.

FENTON (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Until...

INT. BEDROOM -- LATER

Fenton's eyes snap open. The lights are on. Dad is standing
between their beds in his underwear.

DAD
(excited)
Come on, wake up.

Adam lifts up, confused and tired.

ADAM
Dad?

DAD
Get up boys. I've got something to
tell you.

FENTON

What's wrong?
Dad sits down on Fenton's bed.

DAD
Come over here Adam.

Adam gets up and gets on the bed with them.
, DAD (CONT'D)
I want you to wake up and listen to
me. Are you awake?

They both look sleepy, but they nod.

DAD (CONT'D)
I love you both. You know that don't
you?

They both look confused, but they nod again.

DAD (CONT'D)
I need you both to listen to me very
carefully.

INT. DAD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Dad is laying in bed, asleep.

FENTON (V.0.)
He said he'd had a vision that night.

The room slowly fills with light from an unseen source. Dad
opens his eyes and sees the room washed with light. A figure
comes out of the light, moving slowly toward Dad.

FENTON (V.0.) (CONT'D)
A vision from God.

The figure reaches the bed and Dad sees that it is a beautiful
ANGEL straight out of a Botticelli painting.

FENTON (V.0.) (CONT'D)
An angel came to him and told him
the truth of this world...

The angel reaches out and touches Dad's forehead.

FENTON (V.0.) (CONT'D)
And revealed God's special purpose
for our family...

The room disappears into swirling darkness.
INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Fenton and Adam sit on the bed staring at Dad with a mixture
of disbelief and awe.

DAD

We are near the end of the world

here boys. I know it's crazy, but

the angel showed me. There are demons
among us. The devil has released
them for the final battle. It's
being fought now, but no one knows

it, except us and others like us.

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

ADAM
I'm scared Dad.

 

Dad puts an arm around him and pulls him close.

DAD

There's nothing to be afraid of tiger.
God has chosen us. He's given us
jobs to do. We don't fear demons;
we destroy them. We pick'em out one

! by one and pitch'em out of this world.
This is God's purpose for us. The

! angel called us God's hands.

Adam thinks about this. Fenton just stares at Dad.

' ADAM
' So we're like super-heroes?

DAD
Exactly. A family of super-heroes.
We're gonna help save the world.

Dad and Adam are excited. Fenton is dumbfounded.

FENTON
But Dad, that's crazy.

DAD
I know it sounds that way, but it's
the God's honest truth son. I
wouldn't lie to you.

ADAM
So what are our super-powers?

 

DAD
We can see the demons while others
can't. Plus the angel told me God
would send us three weapons to destroy
the demons with.

ADAM
Magical weapons!?

DAD
I imagine so.

Adam's face lights up with excitement. Fenton just stares
numbly at his father, his eyes glazing over in shock.

ADAM .
When do we get them?

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

DAD
I don't know son. The angel just
said soon. I don't know anymore
than what I've just told you except
that we can't tell anyone about this.
The angel was pretty clear on that.
If we tell anyone, we put them and
ourselves in danger. The angel said
God was watching us, that certain
Stars are like cameras that transmit
everything we do straight to God.
Isn't that neat?

Adam nods enthusiastically. Fenton just stares off in space.
Dad notices his expression.

DAD (CONT'D)
I know it's hard to swallow Fenton.
I wanted to wait to tell you once I
had it all figured out myself, but
the angel said I had to wake you up
and tell you now.

Fenton doesn't seem to hear him or see him, he is ina
complete daze.

DAD (CONT'D)
(concerned)
Fenton? Hey, look at me...Fenton?

ANGLE ON FENTON'S FACE

FENTON (V.0O.)
I didn't know what to say or how to
feel. It was too crazy and messed
up to understand or even acknowledge.
I didn't realize it at that moment,
at least not consciously, but my
happy and mostly secure world had
just been flipped over and there
were dark things under there. Very
dark things. And my little boy's
mind just couldn't take it.

INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

DAD (0.S.)
Adam! Fenton!

Fenton's eyes snap open. He lifts up and looks around,

registers where he is. Sunlight streams into the room.
Adam is still asleep, clutching his Princess Leia figure.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED: BL

DAD (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Up and at'em boys.

Fenton pulls back the covers as Dad appears in the doorway.

DAD (CONT'D)
(smiles at Fenton)
Morning kiddo.

He goes to Adam's bed and shakes his leg.

DAD (CONT'D) 7”
C'mon lazy bones.

Adam stirs and mumbles.

DAD (CONT'D)
C'mon, it's late. We overslept.

Fenton just stares at Dad.

DAD (CONT'D)
Snap to it boys and get dressed.
The bus has come and gone and that
means I'm taking you to school. So
get a move on it.

He heads out the door. Fenton stares after him, and then
looks over at Adam as he lifts up. Adam yawns and they look
at each other for a moment.

ADAM
What's wrong with you?

Fenton snaps out of it.

FENTON
Nothing.

INT. TRUCK -- LATER

Dad is driving with Adam-next to him-and Fenton next to the
window. The boys eat toast as Dad drives. Patsy Cline's
Walking After Midnight Plays softly on the radio.

FENTON (V.0.)
None of us mentioned it. It was
only a dream, a nightmare. Nothing
that crazy could be real. Everything
was okay, just like before.

The truck pulls into the school parking lot. Dad puts it in
park and looks over at his sons.

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

DAD
Well, have a good day at school.

Fenton opens the door to get out.
DAD (CONT'D)
And remember not to tell anyone what
I told you last night.
Fenton freezes. Adam pushes him out, and gets out himself.

ADAM
We won't Dad. Bye!

He shuts the door and Dad drives away. Adam walks off toward
the school, leaving Fenton standing in a daze.

INT. CLASSROOM -~- AFTERNOON
The TEACHER talks as she writes math equations on the
chalkboard. Fenton sits at his desk, watching her with heavy
eyes, trying not to fall asleep.
FENTON (V.0.)

I refused to believe it. It was

just a dream. That whole next week

was just a dream too...
INT. HOUSE -- EVENING

Fenton is in the kitchen preparing dinner. Adam sits at the
table, drawing with crayons.

FENTON (V.O.)

Like when Dad started bringing home

the magical weapons.
Dad comes in excited, holding an ordinary wood-handle axe
and an old pair of work gloves. He talks excitedly to Fenton
and Adam, gesturing with the axe.
INSERT: INT. TRUCK -- MORNING
Dad drives down a country road. It is overcast outside.

FENTON (V.0.)
He was on his way to work...

There is an old broken down farmhouse ahead.

FENTON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
When God called to hin.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly a beam of light appears out of the sky and shines
behind the farmhouse. Dad slows down and pulls over across
from it. He gets out of the truck and walks toward the side
of the house.

EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Dad walks up the dirt path around the house and sees a pile
of rotted wood. There stuck in the middle of one of the
logs is an axe with a pair of old work gloves next to it.
The light shines on them from the heavens above.

“BACK TO SCENE: INT. HOUSE -- EVENING

Dad and Adam smile excitedly at one another. Adam reaches
out and touches the axe blade in awe.

DAD
(looks at the gloves)
I still don't understand what these
are for though.

Fenton turns away and busies himself in the kitchen. Dad
notices him and looks concerned.

INT. CLASSROOM -- AFTERNOON

The teacher talks and writes on the chalkboard. Fenton sits
at his desk, his eyes closing and opening sleepily.

FENTON (V.0.)
Just a long long dream...

INT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

Fenton and Adam sit on the couch, watching Mork and Mindy on
television. Dad comes in with a piece of lead pipe and
gestures with it.

DAD
(excitedly)
We got'em all! Won't be long now.
The angel came again last night and
told me that God will send us a list
of our first seven demons soon.

Adam jumps up to look at the new weapon. Fenton looks away
and stares at the television set.

DAD (CONT'D)
Once we finish the first list another
will come, and then another and

DAD (CONT'D)
another for the rest of our lives or
until all the demons have been
destroyed.

ADAM
Yeaaa!!

Fenton just stares at the television without emotion.

FENTON (V.0.)
It wasn't real. It couldn't be. I
just had to wait it out...

INT. KITCHEN -- EVENING

Fenton washes dishes. Dad sits at the table smoking a
cigarette. He watches Fenton, but Fenton ignores him.

DAD
Come over here a minute Fenton.

FENTON
I'm washing dishes.

DAD
They can wait. Come here. I want
to talk to you.

Fenton reluctantly stops and dries his hands on a towel. He
goes to the table and sits down. He stares down at his hands.
Dad looks at him and takes a deep drag off of his cigarette.

DAD (CONT'D)
(exhales)
Fenton, I know you've had some
problems adjusting to everything
that's happened this week, and I'm
sorry son. I really am, but God has
willed it, and we have to obey God.

FENTON
But maybe you just think He did or
dreamed it.

DAD
He did. I wouldn't lie to you son. -

FENTON
But maybe you're...you're not right
in the head Dad. Maybe you need
help.

DAD
(smiles)
It happened Fenton. God sent an
angel to me. It's true. I'm not
crazy. You'll see that soon. That's
what I wanted to talk to you about.
I have the first list now.

He pulls it out of his shirt pocket, unfolds it, and places
it in front of Fenton. There are seven names on it. The
first one is CYNTHIA HARBRIDGE. Fenton looks at it and then
up at Dad.

INSERT: INT. REPAIR GARAGE -- AFTERNOON
A car is jacked up with Dad underneath it, working on it.

FENTON (V.0O.)
The angel came to him while he was
at work.

He is working when suddenly blackness washes over everything.
The Angel's beautiful face floats in front of him. The
Angel's hand reaches out of the darkness and touches his
forehead, and then the darkness recedes and everything goes
back to normal.

He pushes himself out from underneath the car, lifts up,
pulls a small notepad and a pen out of his breast pocket,
and furiously begins to scribble names on it. He stops and
looks at the names he's written. There are seven of them.

BACK TO SCENE: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
Fenton just stares at Dad as though he's lost his mind.
FENTON
(frightened)
But these are people's names.
DAD

Yep and they'll look like people
too, but they're really demons.

Fenton looks at him with horror.

DAD (CONT'D)
The angel said when I lay my hands
on them, I'll reveal them for what
they truly are. That's what the
gloves are for.

DAD (CONT'D)
I've got to get them and bring them
back here with the gloves on. Once
they're here, I take the gloves off
and reveal them. You'll see, then
you'll believe.

He smiles at Fenton. Fenton just stares at him.
INT. CLASSROOM -- AFTERNOON

The teacher talks as she writes on the chalkboard. Fenton
sits at his chair, trying not to doze off.

FENTON (V.0.)

The dream had finally ended. It was
all real. My father was insane. He
was going to murder someone. He had
never been a violent man. I'd never
seen him hit anyone, much less me or
Adam. He didn't even own a gun.

But I knew he was going to kill
someone...

He finally rests his head on his arms and closes his eyes.
INSERT: DAD SWINGS THE AXE. :

Fenton lifts up and screams. The whole class turns and looks
at him.

FENTON (V.0.) (CONT'D)
And I had to stop him.

EXT. ROSE GARDEN -- AFTERNOON
Fenton lays on the grass, reading the bible.

FENTON (V.0.)

The obvious answer was to tell someone
what he was planning, but I couldn't
do that. I loved him even if he'd
gone crazy. I had to save him from
himself. If he thought it was God
that told him to do this awful thing
then I had to prove to him that it
wasn't God. That it had to be the
devil. So I studied the bible looking
for something to fight him with...
 

 

 

“FU

INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Dad is laying in his recliner, reading a book. Adam is laying
in front of the television watching The Love Boat. Fenton
comes in, carrying a bible. Dad looks up at him. Fenton
opens the bible and reads.

FENTON
There is a way that seems right to a
man, but in the end it leads to death.

He looks up at Dad. Dad just looks back at him for a moment.

DAD
Proverbs?

FENTON
Yep. Verse 14. Line 12.

DAD
Huh. Can I see that?

Fenton hands him the bible. Dad takes it, looks at it for a
moment, and then hands it back to him.

DAD (CONT'D)
Read line 32.

Fenton takes it, finds the line and reads it aloud.

FENTON
When calamity comes, the wicked are
brought down, but even in death the
righteous have refuge.

Adam turns away from the television and listens to them.

DAD
You think this is wrong and you're
trying to prove it. I respect that
son, I do, but calamity has come.
The end of the world is near and it
is our jobs to bring the wicked down.
God will take care of us because we
are the righteous. Do you understand?

FENTON

But Dad what would the Baptists say?
We are still Baptists aren't we?

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

DAD

Well, before that angel came to me,
I wasn't so sure I really believed

os in God. I just wasn't sure. God

: was something far away, that didn't

exist everyday in my life or at least
I couldn't see it. I went to church
more or less out of habit than for
spiritual reasons. But now I know,
I really know that God exists. He
is here with us right now. We're
beyond religion. We've got a direct
line to God.

ADAM
Does that mean we don't have to go
to church anymore?

DAD
It sure does.

ADAM
Yeaaa!

Fenton looks disappointed, but doesn't say anything.

EXT. YARD -- AFTERNOON

Dad sits on the ground, pulling weeds out of the flower bed
in front of the house. Fenton walks up next to him and gets

a drink of water from the hose. He wipes his mouth and looks
over at Dad.

 

FENTON
What about thou shalt not kill Dad?

Dad sighs and stops what he's doing.

DAD
This isn't killing. This is
destroying demons. Now get out there
and finish mowing that yard.

FENTON
But what about be careful battling
monsters lest ye become one?

Dad stops what he's doing and looks at Fenton, impressed.

DAD
Shoot Fenton, that's pretty good. I
like that. I'm gonna keep that one
in mind.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

BA
CONTINUED:

He goes back to pulling weeds.

DAD (CONT'D)
Now get out there and finish that
lawn.

INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA -- DAY

Fenton studies the bible while the other children eat and
laugh.

FENTON (V.0.)
There wasn't much in the old testament
to use. Actually there was more in
there to support Dad's case than
mine. All kinds of gruesome stuff
going on back then in the name of
God. The new testament, with the
exception of Revelations of course,
was where all the real ammo was.
When I found Jesus back there I knew
it was going to be alright. I finally
had Dad beat.

INT. KITCHEN -- EVENING

Fenton and Dad sit at the table. Fenton looks up from the
bible in front of him at Dad. They just look at each other
for a long moment.

DAD
Fenton. Everything you just said is
absolutely right and ‘true.

Fenton smiles proudly and Dad smiles back at him.
DAD (CONT'D)
But it only applies to humans son,
not to demons.
Fenton's smile falls away and Dad lights a cigarette.
DAD (CONT'D)
I'm proud of you for all this bible
reading though. You've got
determination that's for sure. You
get to Revelations yet? :

Fenton doesn't say anything.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

DAD (CONT'D)
You tell me when you do cause I never
could understand half of it, but I
figure I should. Maybe we could
figure it out together.

Adam comes into the kitchen with a piece of manilla paper.

ADAM
Hey Dad look. I got a list too.

He hands it to Dad, who looks at it. There are seven names
written on it in crayon. The first name is Billy Dobbs.

DAD
Where'd you get this Adam?

ADAM
(proudly)
God gave it to me.

DAD
(looks at the list)
Isn't Billy Dobbs the kid who was
picking on you last week at school?

ADAM
(nods)
He's a demon.
Dad looks up at him.
DAD
Adam, tell the truth. You made this
list up yourself didn't you?

ADAM
No, God...

DAD
(sternly)
Adam. Tell the truth.
Adam looks down at his shoes.

DAD (CONT'D)
Come here.

Adam climbs into his lap.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

An.

CONTINUED:

DAD (CONT'D)
You can't just make something like
that up son. We destroy demons. If
we used your list, we wouldn't be
destroying demons, we'd be killing
people. And we must never do that.
Destroying demons is a good thing,
but killing people is a very bad
thing. Do you understand?

Adam looks ashamed, but nods his head.

ADAM
I'm sorry Dad.

DAD
(hugs him) .
It's alright, you've just got to be
patient. God will send you your own
list when you're older.

Fenton looks at Adam and Dad with disbelief.

FENTON (V.0.)
I had tried to fight him with God,
but God had forsaken me. The only
thing left to do was to tell.

EXT. POLICE STATION -- AFTERNOON

Fenton stands in front of the station, looking at it and
pacing back and forth.

FENTON (V.0O.)
But that was easier said than done.
I stood out there for almost an hour,
wrestling with myself. Could I really
send my Dad to prison or an insane
asylum? What if the police didn't
believe me? After all it was a pretty
unbelievable situation. And if they
didn't, what would Dad do to me when
he found out?

A POLICE OFFICER comes out of the station and nods at Fenton.
Fenton nods back and hurries off.

INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

It is dark outside. Fenton and Adam sit at the kitchen table,
finishing dinner. There is an empty plate at the table.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

FENTON (V.0.)
That was the last day of school and
Dad had promised to take us to the
movies that night, but he didn't
come home from work.

 

Fenton gets up, takes the empty plate, fills it with food,
and puts it in the oven.

INT. BEDROOM -- LATER

Adam lays in his bed. Fenton turns off the light and gets
into his bed. Adam lifts up and looks over at Fenton.

ADAM
When's Dad coming home?
FENTON
I don't know.
Adam lays back.
, ADAM

You think he's destroying a demon?

FENTON
That's all make believe Adam.

 

ADAM
No it's not, it's...

FENTON
(lifts up)
Listen to me. None of that demon
junk is real. Dad just made it up.

ADAM
No he didn't.

FENTON
He did too. Just like Santa Claus.

Adam frowns. An old wound has been exposed.
FENTON (CONT'D)
You remember last Christmas when you
caught Dad putting our presents under
the tree don’t you?
Adam's frown deepens and he nods.

FENTON (CONT'D)
It's just like that.

Adam looks unsure.

~ FENTON (CONT'D)
: Adam, have I ever lied to you?

Adam thinks about this for a moment and then shakes his head.

FENTON (CONT'D)
That's right. I haven't, but Dad
has. You've got to trust me now
Adam. I'm telling you the truth.
Dad' sick. Demons do not exist.
Those names on Dad's list are real
people. Do you understand?

ADAM
But why would he make it up?
FENTON
I don't know, but I think we should

leave.
Adam thinks about this for a moment.

ADAM
You mean run away?

FENTON
aa (nods)
Mca Would you go with me?
ADAM

I don't want to leave Dad.

FENTON
Neither do I, but we might have to.

ADAM
Why?

Fenton stares at the ceiling.

FENTON
Dad's going to kill somebody.

INT. BEDROOM -- LATER

Adam and Fenton are both asleep. Headlights from the window
wash the room with light for a moment and then disappear.
Fenton wakes up. Outside an engine IDLES for a moment and
then shuts off. A truck door OPENS and then SHUTS. Fenton
gets up and goes to the window. He sees Dad's silhouette,
carrying something over his shoulder toward the house.
 

4%.

INT. FRONT HALL -- MOMENTS LATER

Keys RATTLE in the front door. Fenton peeks around the corner
of the hallway. The door opens, revealing Dad. He reaches

in and turns on the front hall light switch next to the door.
He sees Fenton watching hin.

DAD
Hey there kiddo.
(motions to him)
Come over here and help me.

Dad turns back to something on the porch. Fenton walks toward
him and looks past him to the porch. He sees a WOMAN laying
there, her mouth covered with duct tape, her eyes wide with
fear and tears streaming down her face. Fenton freezes,
staring at the woman. He notices dried blood in her hair

and on her forehead. Dad bends down, picks her up, and
carries her inside the house. Her hands and feet are tied.

DAD (CONT'D)
(to Fenton)
Shut the door.

Fenton moves forward slowly, eyeing the woman in his father's
arms, and shuts the door. Dad carries her into the living
room and puts her down on the couch. Fenton comes in and
looks at her and then at Dad.

4 ADAM (0.S.)
Dad?

Dad and Fenton turn and look at Adam who is standing in the
hallway in his pajamas rubbing his eyes. Adam sees the woman.

ADAM (CONT'D)
Who's that?

That's a demon, Son.

INT. GARAGE -~ DAY

Dad is standing in front of a car with an opened hood, working
on it.

FENTON (V.0.)
God came to him earlier that day at
work and told him that the time had
come.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

He suddenly stops what he's doing and goes to a shelf in the
corner of the garage and pulls out several phonebooks. He
flips through one until he finds a name. He pulls out his
list from his pocket and looks at the first name on it,
CYNTHIA BARTLETT, and then over at the phonebook where her
name, address, and phone number is printed. He tears the
page out of the book, stuffs it in his pocket, and goes back
to work on the car.

INT. TRUCK -- LATER
Dad drives down the highway.

FENTON (V.0O.)
After work he drove down to
Jacksonville, about 45 minutes or so
southwest of Tyler.

INT. TRUCK -- NIGHT
Dad drives slowly down a run-down residential street.

FENTON (V.0.)
He said he'd never been there before,
but he had no problem finding it.
God was leading him.

He cuts the headlights, pulls the truck over on the side of
the street, and gets out.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- CONTINUOUS

He looks at the house across the street. It's lights are

on, and there is the faint sound of music playing. He puts

on the gloves and pulls out the lead pipe from his back pocket
as he walks toward the house.

EXT. HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Dad goes to the front door, holding the lead pipe behind his
back, and is about to knock when the door opens and Cynthia
comes out, carrying her purse. She shuts the door behind
her and locks it, never noticing Dad standing behind her.

DAD
Cynthia Bartlett?

CYNTHIA
(turns startled)
Yes?
 

EXT. BACKYARD -- MOMENTS LATER

Dad comes out of the backdoor carrying the woman over his
shoulder, with Adam right behind him. Fenton follows after
them reluctantly.

DAD
(calls quietly to him)
Come on. It's alright.

He leads them to the tool shed near the back fence. It is
one of those big red aluminum sheds from Sears.

INT. SHED -- MOMENTS LATER

Dad puts the woman down on the dirt floor of the shed. Adam
stands looking at her curiously. Fenton lingers in the
doorway.

DAD
(to Fenton)
Come in and shut the door.

He does as he is told. Dad goes to his work bench where
there is a little shelf that holds the axe. He takes the
lead pipe out of his back pocket and puts it on the shelf,
and turns to his sons. Adam looks excited, but unsure.
Fenton looks scared.

DAD (CONT'D)
Come here boys.

Adam goes to him, but Fenton comes to him reluctantly. He
puts one arm around Adam and one around Fenton, and turns
them both toward the woman on the floor.

DAD (CONT'D)
That may look like a woman, but it's
not. That is a demon.

The woman looks up at them with tears in her eyes, and tries
to say something from behind the tape on her mouth.

DAD (CONT'D)
They all look like humans, just like
her. But inside they are murderous
- beasts... .

Fenton and Adam look at the woman.

DAD (CONT'D)

.-here to destroy the entire human
race. And it is up to us, our family,
to destroy them. It is God's will.
When I put my hands on her, you will
see the truth.

 

Dad pulls off his gloves and takes down the axe from the
shelf. Fenton looks terrified. Adam looks mostly curious.

FENTON
Dad, don't do this!

Dad holds the axe and looks at Fenton.

DAD
I love you with all my heart Fenton.
If I could spare you this I would.
But this is God's will and we are
His servants. Don't be afraid, Son.
You'll understand when I touch her.

' He moves toward the terrified woman. He bends down and
extends his free hand toward her. Fenton watches him,
paralyzed with terror.

CUT TO PRESENT:

INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE

 

Doyle stares at Fenton incredulously.

DOYLE
Is that true?

FENTON
Why would I make it up?

DOYLE
Where's your father now?

FENTON
Dead.

Doyle sits there, thinking about what he’s just heard. The
door opens and Hull sticks his head in the office. Doyle
looks up at him.

HULL
Thinking about heading out.

Unless you need me to stay.

CONTINUED:

DOYLE
No. No. You go ahead.

HULL
Alright, see you later.

Doyle waves and nods absentmindedly, and Hull leaves. Doyle
looks at Fenton.

DOYLE
So he killed that woman? Right there
in front of you?
Fenton nods.
FENTON
But not to his way of thinking. He
hadn't killed a woman. He had
destroyed a demon. You see, he
believed that when he touched her...
CUT TO FLASHBACK:

Dad reaches out and touches Cynthia. Her eyes go wide.

That's what he claimed.

DOYLE

Believe me I've heard all kinds of
crazy stuff, but that's a first.
What ‘did you do? . '

FENTON
What could I do? I watched him kill
her and then I watched him bury her.

CUT TO FLASHBACK:

EXT. ROSE GARDEN -- NIGHT

They are in the back of the garden, away from the garden
proper. Dad digs a hole near a lone rosebush while Adam
sits on the ground, holding the flashlight for him. There
are three holes in the ground, forming a circle, and three
black trash bags laying on the ground. Fenton sits next to
Adam, staring at the bags, crying. Dad finishes the last
hole and picks up one of the trash bags. Adam gets up and
picks up one too. He throws the bag inside one of the holes.

DAD
No Adam. Do it like this.

He reaches down and pulls the bag out of the hole, opens it,
and dumps the contents into the hole.

DAD (CONT'D)
We've got to do this right boys.
The angel was real specific.

ADAM.
Why do we have to bury them in three
different holes?

DAD .
That's the way God wants it done.
We cut them at the neck and the waist
and then bury'em out here. That's
all I was told.

ADAM
Why out here?

(CONFINUED)
 

 

Bo,
CONTINUED:

DAD
God chose it just like he chose us I
suppose.

Dad looks over at Fenton, sees him crying. He goes to him
and puts an arm around him.

DAD (CONT'D)
Don't cry Fenton. It's alright.
She wasn't human. Didn't you see
that when I touched her?

Fenton shakes his head no and tries to hold in his sobs, a
few escaping him anyway.

ADAM
I saw it Dad.

Dad smiles and winks at him and he smiles back.

FENTON
You...You killed her...

He cries harder.

DAD
I didn't kill her son. She was a
demon. I don't understand why you
didn't see it. You were supposed to
see the truth just like we did.

Dad looks over at the black trashbags.

DAD (CONT'D)

You know I wasn't so sure I could do
it myself. I mean she looked like a
woman to me too, but after I touched
her all I could see was the demon.
And I just had to destroy it. That's
what seeing it did to me. I'm sorry
you didn't see it. :

(gets up)
I don't understand why though. But
there's always next time.

FENTON
You're going to do it again?!

DAD .
This is our job now son. We're God's
hands. You've got to accept that.
We've started something we've got to
finish. There's thousands...

FENTON
You can't! I won't let you!
DAD
You can't stop it. We're doing God's
wor...
FENTON
I'll tell!

Dad's face goes dark, and he grabs Fenton by the arn.

DAD
If you do, someone will die. Maybe
even you. The angel was clear on
that. Do you understand?

Fenton cries and tries to pull away.

DAD (CONT'D)
Answer me! Do you understand!?

FENTON
(cries)
Yes!

Dad lets go of him, and looks ashamed.

DAD
I'm sorry. It's just...I love you.
I don't want you to get hurt or get
anyone else hurt. You'll understand
soon. I promise. But until then
you have to promise me you won't
tell.

Fenton doesn't say anything.
DAD (CONT'D)
(sternly)
Fenton.

FENTON
I..pr..pr..promise.

He reaches down and tousles his hair, though Fenton jumps a
little at his touch. Dad frowns at his reaction.

DAD

You'd better keep that promise.
Remember, God is watching you.

Dad goes back to the hole and begins to fill it with dirt as
Fenton looks up at the stars fearfully.

CUT TO PRESENT:
INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
Doyle stares at Fenton.

DOYLE
So you didn't tell?

Fenton shakes his head.

FENTON
I should have, but I was afraid. I
loved my father, but I was terrified
of him. He was a murderer. “How
could I know how far it went?

Doyle looks lost in thought. He glances at the picture of
his mother. Fenton studies him carefully.

FENTON (CONT'D)
So now do you understand why I think
my brother is the God's Hand killer?

DOYLE
(rubs his eyes)
I suppose. But then again what you've
described happened to you both. So
it could be you just as much as him.

FENTON
But I didn't believe Agent Doyle.
Adam did. That night I saw my father
kill a woman with a hand axe, but
Adam saw him destroy a demon. No
matter what I tried to tell him, he
still believed Dad. To him we were
knights of God on a holy mission to
abolish evil.

-Doyle thinks about this for a long moment.

DOYLE
Do you have any physical proof?

FENTON
I read in the paper that only one of
the bodies of the six victims had
been found. Is that true?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

DOYLE
You read it in the paper didn't you?

FENTON
That doesn't make it true.

DOYLE
Well in this case it does. The first
victim was found mutilated with a
note saying that God's hand had taken
him. With all the others, only notes
were found. No bodies.

FENTON
How do you know they're dead then?

DOYLE
We don't for sure. But the first
note told us we wouldn't find any
bodies from then on. It said he
wanted to keep them.

FENTON
I've got a pretty good idea where
the bodies are.

DOYLE
The Rose Garden?

FENTON
(nods)
There were other holes out where I
buried him. Some of them looked
freshly covered.

DOYLE
Why didn't you tell me that to begin
with!?
He jumps up.
FENTON

Would you have believed me?
Doyle gives him a look.

DOYLE
Come on.

Doyle and Fenton walk through the lobby. The operator glances
up at them from her book and then continues reading.
 

 

 

EXT. PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

It is raining lightly. Fenton and Doyle walk quickly out to
Doyle's car. Doyle reaches into his back, pulls out a set
of handcuffs, and tosses them to Fenton.

FENTON
What's this?

DOYLE
There's something about you I don't
trust. Everything you've told me so
far is screwy. It may be the truth
like you say, and if it is I'll
apologize later, but for now you
put'em on or I'll put'em on you.

Fenton puts the cuffs on as Doyle opens the backdoor of the
car. Fenton starts to get in. Doyle reaches out to help
him, but Fenton recoils.

FENTON
I've got it.

Doyle backs off, lets him get in, and then shuts the door.
INT. DOYLE'S CAR ~- MOMENTS LATER

Doyle drives. Fenton sits in the back. There is a metal
cage divider between them. Doyle looks at him in the rearview
mirror and then back at the road.

DOYLE
So tell me something. Why did you
wait so long to come forth?

FENTON
I didn't even know about the case
until three days ago.

DOYLE
That's impossible. It's been all
over the news for the past few months.

FENTON
I don't watch the news or read
newspapers.

DOYLE

You just told me that you'd read an
article on it in the paper.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
FENTON
I did. I happened to see the headline
“ three days ago. God's hand claims
ae sixth victim. I bought the paper

and called Adam, but he wasn't there.
I left a message and he called me
back that next night.

DOYLE
You knew and you left a message?

FENTON
I didn't know for sure. I suspected.

DOYLE
No, you knew. Admit it. You knew
and you didn't tell anyone.

FENTON
I'm telling you now.

They drive in silence for a long moment.

DOYLE
You have to admit it's all a pretty
big coincidence. I mean, the day
after you just happen to notice that
there is a killer on the loose, who
you know is your own brother, he
kills himself.

 

FENTON
I'm telling you the truth. He was
the killer.

DOYLE

I'm just saying it's a pretty hard
tale to swallow.

FENTON
Yeah, and so was the one I told you
when I first came into your office.
But it was true, wasn't it?

Doyle looks at him in the rearview and then back at the road.
FENTON (CONT'D)

Lies are always easy to.believe Agent
Doyle. It's the truth that's hard.

Doyle? Tell me, how did your mother
die?

 

 

‘ Doyle looks up sharply at him in the rearview mirror.

DOYLE
What did you say to me?

FENTON
You told me she died after that
picture was taken. But there was
something about the way you...

DOYLE
My mother is none of your damn...

Doyle catches himself, though he grips the wheel angrily.
Fenton doesn't say anything. Doyle coldly watches the
windshield wipers wiping away at the rain.

om, DOYLE (CONT'D)

eon My mother was...murdered. Senselessly

“ butchered by some whacked out killer
like your Dad.

FENTON
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

DOYLE
I don’t like to talk about it, but
it's not a secret.

FENTON
I'm sorry.

DOYLE
Forget it.

They drive along for a moment.

FENTON
Did they ever catch her killer?

DOYLE
Nope.

FENTON
Is that why you took this job?

DOYLE
Something like that. You know, you're
pretty good at this. Ever think of
becoming a cop?

FENTON
When I was a kid.

DOYLE
You've got the instincts for it.
But I've got them too and mine are
telling me you're hiding something
from me.

FENTON
What do you think I'm hiding?

DOYLE
I'm not so sure yet, but my instincts
are hardly ever wrong. So why don't
you finish your story and I'll see
if I can't figure it out.

INT. HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Fenton and Adam sit in the living room watching Good Times
on television. Adam laughs at the television, but Fenton
just sits staring at it, lost in thought.

FENTON (V.0O.)
After that night, I guess you'd expect
Dad to set out to teach us murder
like most Texans teach their children
racism. But nothing happened. Dad
didn't mention it anymore, and neither
did Adam. After a couple of weeks I
began to think it was over.

Fenton and Adam swim in the water with the other CHILDREN.

Fenton lays back on the ground and looks up at the clouds.

FENTON (V.0.)

Dad reads a book. Adam plays with his Star Wars figures in
the back of the van. Fenton just stares at the mall entrance.

FENTON (V.0.) ¢
I know Dad's abductions may seem
really simple, but those were simpler
times. Nowadays you'd have to concoct
some elaborate scheme to abduct
someone. People expect psychos around

Fenton sits on the ground with his eyes still shut tight,
shaking with sobs. Dad sighs and grabs Edward by the waist
and lifts him by himself.

INT. VAN -- LATER

Dad drives along in silence. Fenton's crying has tapered
off, but hasn't completely stopped. Adam wraps Edward's
hands together with an enormous amount of duct tape as he
lays unconscious on the floorboard in the back. His feet
are already taped together with an even thicker wad of tape.
Dad looks back at Adam in the rearview mirror.

DAD
That's good Adam. Don't waste tape.

ADAM
You sure? What if he gets loose?

You've already used three rolls. I

Adam wraps his hands one more time and then stops.

at Fenton who stands against the shed wall next to Adam.

there, don't you? Well, it's not.

FENTON'S P.O.V. Dad walks over to Edward and puts his hand
on him. Dad jerks as though he's being shocked. Edward
looks up at Dad, his eyes wide with fear.

DAD'S P.O.V. Edward sits in.a living room, watching a sitcom.
Over the sound of the television, there is a baby crying off
screen. On the couch next to him are two dead bodies, a man
and a woman. He laughs hysterically at the sitcom, blending
with the baby's cries.

ADAM'S P.O.V. A bright shining light illuminates the shed.
Angels appear out of the light and circle Edward.

Dad takes his hand off of him and steps back, seething with
rage.

DAD (CONT'D)
Didn't think anyone knew about that
did you!?

He goes to the workbench and picks up the axe.

DAD (CONT'D)
But God saw you.

He moves closer to him, holding the axe with both hands.

FENTON
(moves forward)
Dad don't! Don't!

DAD
And you can't escape God's wrath!

He swings it straight at the man's head. Blood splatters
Fenton's Charlie's Angels t-shirt.

EXT. ROSE GARDEN -- NIGHT

Adam and Fenton dig holes while Dad sits on the ground,
smoking and watching Fenton.

DAD
I can't believe you still didn't see
it. >
Fenton looks up hatefully at him, but keeps digging.
DAD (CONT'D)

He was a murderer Fenton. He killed
little babies!

He gets up from the ground and tosses his cigarette.

DAD (CONT'D)
(upset)
Babies.

He walks off toward the house in the distance. Fenton stops
digging and takes one of the black trash bags and dumps it
in one of the holes. He stands over the hole and looks down
at the bloody mess.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

FENTON
He's the murderer. We've got to get
out of here Adam.

Adam looks over at him as he digs.

ADAM
What do you mean?

FENTON
We've got to run away. Remember I
told you we might have to.

ADAM
I don't want to run away.

FENTON
We have to. Dad's crazy Adam. He's
a murderer.

ADAM

No he's not. He's a demon slayer.
FENTON

That's all lies Adam.
ADAM

No it's not. I see it when he touches

them.
Fenton looks angrily at his brother.

FENTON
No you don't! Dad's brainwashed
you. It's all a big lie. He's a
murderer and you help him!

ADAM
Nuh-uh! We're serving God's will!
I'm gonna tell Dad on you.

Fenton charges at Adam who drops his empty bag and runs off
toward the house. The wind catches the empty bag and blows
it into a rose bush where it snags on the thorns. Fenton
falls to his knees and cries as Adam runs off. Blood drips
from the empty bag onto a rose.

INT. HOUSE -- LATER

Fenton comes in, looking exhausted. He enters the living
room and finds Dad sitting in his recliner in the dark.
They look at each other for a long moment, but neither says
anything. Fenton walks off down the hall.

 

CF
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

 

 

 

It is very early. Dad comes in fully dressed and shakes
Fenton awake.

DAD
Get up and get dressed. And don't
wake your brother. |

Fenton watches him leave the room. He looks over at the
clock and sees that it is 5:03 AM.

INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Fenton comes into the kitchen looking sleepy. Dad sits at
the table sipping a cup of coffee. Dad looks up at him.

DAD
Sit down. '

He takes the seat across from Dad.

DAD (CONT'D)
Your brother told me what you said
last night. I want you to know that
I've never killed anything in my
entire life Fenton.

FENTON
That's a lie and you know it.

DAD

(sighs)
When God asked me to destroy demons,
I had to trust God's word that they
really were demons. It was a question
of faith. I've heard preachers call
it the leap of faith. And I took
that leap. I chose to believe.

(beat)
And when I did that, everything
flipped over. And I ‘realized that
it was the right thing. It was my
destiny.

Fenton just looks at him.

DAD (CONT'D)
I did a lot of thinking and praying
last night after you went to bed. I
prayed for an angel to visit you.

told me something I...I don't want

FENTON
What?

DAD
It doesn't matter because together
you and I are going to prove him
wrong. JI love you son. I don't ~
want anything to happen to you.

Dad looks down at his coffee.

DAD (CONT'D)
You just don't have any faith. That's
why you can't see the truth.
{looks up at him)
But we're going to change that.

EXT. BACKYARD -~ MOMENTS LATER

The sun is barely starting to come up. There is a glaze of
dew over the grass. Dad comes out of the shed with Fenton
following him, carrying a shovel. Dad walks out into the
yard and looks around. He walks back toward the side of the
shed and stops, looking at the ground. He motions for Fenton,
and points at the ground.

DAD
I want you to dig a hole here. It'll
need to be about twenty feet deep
and about twenty feet wide in both
directions.

 

Fenton looks at him incredulously.

DAD (CONT'D)
The length and width should form a (
perfect square.

FENTON
What!?

DAD
You heard me.

FENTON
Why! ?

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

DAD
‘ Take that tone out of your voice.
a Because I told you to. You might
think I'm some crazed killer, but
I'm still your father and you'll do
what I tell you. You understand me?

Fenton doesn't respond.

DAD (CONT'D)
(in a warning tone)
Fenton.
FENTON
Yes sir.
DAD

Now, we're going to build ourselves
a little cellar out here.

FENTON
A cellar?

DAD
Yep. And until you give in to God's
will and accept your place in this
family, you're going to do most of
the work by yourself.

 

FENTON
I can't do that by myself. I don't
even know how to build a cellar.

DAD
I'll take care of that. All you
have to do is the labor.

FENTON
All of it!?

DAD
Yep. You're going to serve God's
will one way or another. And God
wants us to have a cellar to help us
in our mission so get to work.

He walks off.
DAD (CONT'D)
(calls behind him)

I want at least half that hole dug
when I get home from work.

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

FENTON
But Dad! I can't do that!

DAD
Pray. Maybe God will help you.

Fenton watches him disappear around the side of the house,
and then looks down at the ground angrily.

EXT. BACKYARD -- LATER

It is late morning now. The dew is gone and the sun blazes
in the sky. Fenton digs the hole. It is about five feet
wide and long, but only about two feet deep. There is a
small pile of dirt by the hole. He is covered in sweat.

FENTON (V.O.)
I started digging that goddamn hole,
but I did not pray. I would not. I
hated God. I despised Him. My hatred
helped me dig. It kept me going.
Dad's or God's or the angels' or
whoever's plan it was would not work
on me. I knew what Dad was doing
was wrong and nothing was going to
change that.

EXT. BACKYARD -- LATER

The sun beats down on Fenton as he digs diligently. His
shirt is now off and tied around his head. His back is
slightly sunburned. He is literally drenched in sweat. The
hole is about three feet deep, and about ten feet in length
and width. Fenton digs steadily, throwing dirt over his
shoulder into the ever growing pile by the hole.

ADAM (0.S.)
Hey Fenton.

Fenton keeps digging, lost in thought.

ADAM (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Fenton!

Fenton stops and looks up at his brother. He is holding a
big plastic cup of water. He extends it to Fenton. Fenton
takes it and gulps half of it down. Adam looks at the hole.

ADAM (CONT'D)
How big does it have to be?

FENTON
Twenty feet long, wide and deep.

ADAM

(eyes wide)
That's huge.

 

Fenton puts the cup down and starts to shovel again. Adam
watches him for a moment.

ADAM (CONT'D)
I'm sorry I told on you.

He stops digging and looks at Adam.

FENTON
You didn't tell him what I said about
running away, did you?

ADAM
No.

FENTON
Will you go with me then?

ADAM
(shakes his head)
There's no reason to go.

FENTON
He's a killer Adam.

ADAM
No, he's not. Why can't you just
believe? Dad said we could both
help you dig the hole if you did.

 

Fenton looks angry, but doesn't say anything. He begins to
dig again.

ADAM (CONT'D)
I've been praying for you.

He digs faster, his anger mounting.

ADAM (CONT'D)
Have you been praying?
FENTON
(snaps at him)
Nope. And I'm not going to.

ADAM
But Dad said that...

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

 

FENTON
I don't care what Dad said! He might
be able to make me dig this stupid
hole, but he can't make me pray.

ADAM
But maybe if we both pray God will
show you the truth like he did for
me and Dad.

Fenton stops digging and looks sharply at him.

FENTON
You're as crazy as Dad. Just get
out of here and leave me alone.

Adam looks crushed. Fenton goes back to digging. Adam turns
to go, but turns back.

BDAM
I'll help you if you promise you
won't tell Dad.

FENTON
I don't want your help.

He keeps digging.

ADAM
But there's another shovel in the...

FENTON
Get out of here!

He throws dirt at him, and he runs off. Fenton watches him
run off, and frowns regretfully.

FENTON (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I wanted to run away, far away, but
I still couldn't leave Adam no matter
how crazy Dad was turning him. And
besides, there was nowhere to go.

Fenton goes back to digging.

EXT. BACKYARD -- LATER

The sun is starting to go down. Fenton still digs, but a
little slower than before. The hole is considerably deeper

now, about five feet deep, but still about ten feet long and
wide. The dirt pile has grown considerably.

(CONTINUED)

 
yo,

 

CONTINUED:

DAD (0.S.)
Looks like you've been busy.

Fenton looks up and sees Dad standing over the side of the
hole.

DAD (CONT'D)
Ain't exactly half, but it's
impressive. Pretty smart way to do
it too. I wouldn't let it get much
deeper before you start the other
half though. -

Fenton climbs out of the hole with the shovel, and starts to
dig at the edge of it to make it longer.

DAD (CONT'D)
Oh, I'd say that's about enough for
today. Come on in and I'll make us
some supper. Looks like we've both
had a long hard day.

Fenton ignores him and keeps digging.

DAD (CONT'D)
Fenton. I said that's enough.

Fenton keeps digging. Dad watches him for a moment.

DAD (CONT'D)
(sighs)
Well supper'll be waiting for you
when you decide to come in. You did
good today Fenton.

He looks at Fenton for some sort of response, but gets none.
Fenton just keeps digging. Dad sighs again and walks off.
Fenton never stops digging, an angry look of determination
on his face.

EXT. BACKYARD -- LATER

It is pitch dark out now. The only light is from the porch.
The hole is a little longer now. Fenton stops digging and
puts the shovel down. He looks at the hole for a moment and
then starts to walk toward the house.

INT. HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Fenton enters from the backdoor in the kitchen. He looks

hungrily at the plate of cold food sitting on the table, but
walks past it. He walks down the hall and goes into the

bathroom.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED: We

The sound of the television playing and Dad and Adam laughing
is heard in the background. He turns on the faucet in the
sink, wincing at the pain. His hands are a bloody mess of
popped blisters. He puts them under the water and cries out
softly.

INT. KITCHEN -- LATER

Fenton sits at the table, eating. It is hard for him to
hold his fork and knife because of his blistered hands. Dad
enters from the hallway and sees him at the table.

DAD
Finally gave up, huh kiddo?

FENTON
I didn't give up. I'll be out there
again in the morning.

Dad frowns at him and sits down across from him at the table.

DAD
I didn't mean it like that. Look, I
don't want to fight with you son. I
love you. I'm not doing this to
hurt you.

Fenton keeps eating, staring down at his plate.

DAD (CONT'D)
I wish you could understand that.

Fenton keeps eating. Dad watches him for a moment.

DAD (CONT'D)
Did you pray while you were out there?

FENTON
(looks up defiantly)
Nope.

Dad frowns, but doesn't say anything. Fenton keeps eating,
but drops his knife loudly on the plate. He picks it up
again, but it’s obvious he's in pain.

DAD

What's the matter with you?
FENTON

Nothing.
DAD

Let me see your hands.

(CONTINUED)
oo,

 

CONTINUED:

FENTON
They're fine.

Dad reaches out and pulls one of Fenton's hands out where he
can see it.

DAD
Didn't you use gloves today?

Fenton pulls his hand away.

FENTON
I didn't need them. I'm fine.

Dad gets up, goes to the kitchen cabinets, and gets some
aspirin. He takes a couple out of the bottle and tries to
hand them to Fenton.

DAD
Here. It'll ease the pain.

FENTON
I said I'm fine.

DAD
Fenton, I know you're mad at me, but
that's no reason to cause yourself
pain. Now take them.

Fenton hesitates, but takes the pills and swallows them.
Dad watches him with a concerned look on his face.

DAD (CONT'D)
There's a pair of work gloves out in
the shed.

FENTON

They've got blood on them.

DAD
I didn't mean those. There's some
others. I want you to use them from
now on. They won't do you any good
now that you've wrecked your hands,
but in a few days you'll be fine.

Fenton keeps eating.

DAD: (CONT'D)
You did good out there today Fenton.

He tries to tousle his hair, but Fenton pulls away.

Fenton doesn't respond.

DAD (CONT'D)
Did you hear me?

FENTON ~-
(flatly)
I heard you.

DAD
Well, good-night then.

Fenton stares silently at his plate. Dad sighs and exits.
EXT. BACKYARD -- MORNING

It is extremely early. The sun is just barely starting to
come out. Fenton comes out of the house, walks out to the
hole, and looks down at it. He takes the shovel from where
he left it the day before, and winces from the pain in his
hands. He slowly starts to dig in the dew covered grass.

EXT. BACKYARD -- LATER

The sun is out, but it is still early morning. Fenton still
digs. The back screendoor creaks open and shuts in the
distance. Fenton keeps digging. Dad walks up to the side

of the hole and watches him for a few moments. Fenton notices
him, but doesn't look up or stop. Dad walks off.

After a few moments, a pair of gloves hit him in the head.
He stops and looks in the direction of where the gloves came
from, and sees Dad's back walking away. He looks at the
gloves, and starts to dig again.

, FENTON (V.0.)
I kept digging. My hands hurt, but
I wouldn't stop. The pain helped me
keep going. It fed my hatred. I
would never give in to Dad or his
God.

EXT. BACKYARD -- EVENING

The sun is going down. Fenton keeps digging. The hole and
the pile of dirt beside it are both considerably larger.

FENTON (V.0.)
I kept digging and Dad kept killing.

Dad comes around the side of the house, carrying a person
over his shoulder, with Adam following behind him. Fenton
stops digging and watches them. Dad looks over at Fenton,
their eyes lock for a moment, and then he disappears into
the shed. Adam goes in and shuts the door behind then.

FENTON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But he left me alone.

Fenton goes back to digging.
FENTON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I kept at it morning, noon, and night
for five days.
EXT. BACKYARD. -- MORNING

Fenton stands on the edge of the giant hole, looking down
into it.

FENTON (V.0.)
And by the sixth day, it was as dark
and deep as my hatred for Dad's God.
Dad walks up from behind Fenton, and peers down at the hole.

DAD
Well you finished it alright.

Fenton just stares down at the hole.
DAD (CONT'D)
But I bet you didn't pray once the
whole time. Did you?
Fenton looks up at Dad, defiant and proud.

FENTON
Nope.

Dad looks at him wearily and then back down at the hole.
EXT. HOUSE -- DAY

The van is parked way up in the driveway near the backyard.
The side door of the van is open and there are stacks of
wood inside of it. Adam and Fenton take wood from the van

to the backyard where Dad is in the hole, using a hoe to
smooth out the ground. They stack the wood next to the hole.

FENTON (V.0O.)
We started the cellar after that.
At least that's what Dad called it,
but I knew better. We were building
a dungeon down there.

Fenton stacks the wood and stares down at Dad in the hole.
EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY

There is the beginnings of a wooden cellar in the hole.
Dad, Adam, and Fenton hammer away.

FENTON (V.0O.)
It wasn't much of a cellar though or
even a dungeon. Dad was definitely
no architect.
EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY
The cellar has a roof now.
FENTON (V.0.)
We basically built a big wooden box
in the ground.
INT. CELLAR -- DAY
There is a lantern, but it is still somewhat dark. Fenton
and Adam help Dad build a stairway that leads up to the top
of the hole to an opened hatch where sunlight floods in.
FENTON (V.0.)
But Dad said it would hold. God
would see to it.
EXT. BACKYARD -~- DAY

Fenton and Adam and Dad stand on the ground, shoveling dirt
onto the cellar, covering it up.

INT. CELLAR -- CONTINUOUS

The makeshift support beams creak, but hold.

EXT. BACKYARD -- LATER :

The cellar is completely covered up with packed dirt, except
for the hatch. Fenton and Adam come in and out of the shed,

taking things out of it, and putting them in the yard. Dad
packs the dirt some more with the back of a shovel.

EXT. BACKYARD -~ LATER

They move the shed, with Dad on one side and Fenton and Adam
on the other, and position it over the cellar hatch.

INT. SHED -- MOMENTS LATER

Adam and Fenton and Dad put stuff back in the shed. Dad
looks around, satisfied.

DAD
You did good boys. Especially you
Fenton.

Fenton ignores him and keeps arranging things. Dad frowns.
INT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

Fenton and Adam sit in the living room watching Happy Days

on television. Dad's van is heard pulling up in the driveway.

Adam jumps up and runs to the front door to greet him, but
Fenton doesn't move.

FENTON (V.0.)
The next night he brought home another
demon.
Fenton hears Dad come in and Adam greet him.

DAD (0.S.)
Hey tiger. Where's your brother?

ADAM (0.S.)
Watching tv.

DAD (0.S.)
Fenton!

Fenton stays where he is and doesn’t say a word. He hears
Dad's footsteps coming down the front hall.

DAD (CONT'D)
Fenton! ?

Fenton looks at the entryway to the living room, and sees
Dad standing there, holding a TEENAGE GUY over his shoulder,
his hands and feet tied together with duct tape.
DAD (CONT'D)
Fenton, you answer me when I call
you. Come out to the cellar.

Fenton stares at him stubbornly, and doesn't move.

Fenton gets up angrily, and Dad turns to walk away. When he
does, Fenton sees the teenager's terrified face. There are
tears in his eyes and duct tape over his mouth.

INT. CELLAR -- MOMENTS LATER
Dad puts the teenager down on the floor. Adam holds the
lantern, looking at him curiously. The teenager looks back _

at Adam and seems to calm down a little. Fenton hangs back
on the steps. Dad notices hin.

DAD
Get down here.

Fenton does as he's told, though slowly. Dad peels off his
gloves and picks up the axe from the corner of the room. He
walks toward Fenton, and extends the axe to him. Fenton
looks at it, but doesn’t take it.
DAD (CONT'D)
(sternly)
It has to be done. It's God's will.
He extends the axe to Fenton again.
DAD (CONT'D)
Now do it like I showed you. The
neck first.

The teenager squirms and moans on the floor. Fenton looks
from him to Dad to the axe, and then runs back up the steps.

DAD (CONT'D)
Fenton! Get back here! Fenton!

Dad hears the shed door slam.

ADAM
I'll do it Dad.

He looks at Adam and then at the teenager.

Fenton runs away from the house quickly, and breaks into a
sprint once he hits the gravel road.

himself to come out of the night and

stop me. But I had to do it. I had ~
to put an end to the whole thing.

EXT. POLICE STATION -- MOMENTS LATER
Fenton runs up to the station and enters.
INT. POLICE STATION -- CONTINUOUS
Fenton runs in, panting. The place is empty.
FENTON

No one answers. Fenton walks through the place, looking
increasingly worried.

FENTON (CONT'D)
Hello! Hello!?

There is no one there.
FENTON (CONT'D)

head out.

Deputy Smalls looks at him for a long moment and then hangs
up the phone.

DEPUTY SMALLS

He gets up and Fenton follows him.
EXT. HOUSE -- LATER

A patrol car pulls up to the house and parks. All the lights
to the house are off. Fenton and Deputy Smalls get out.

 

FENTON
It's around back, under the shed.

DEPUTY SMALLS

That's enough of that boy. We're
gonna put an end to this. Come on.

He pulls him towards the porch.

FENTON
But he's in the back.

 

DEPUTY SMALLS
Let's see what your Dad has to say.

Dad, now in a pair of blue-jeans, pours Deputy Smalls a glass

DAD
Well, that is quite a tale alright.
Makes me cringe to think he told
lies like that to everyone down at
the police station.

FENTON
They're not lies and you know it!

Smalls looks uncomfortable at Fenton's outburst.

DEPUTY SMALLS :
Well, you can put your mind at ease
about that. I was the only one there
and of course...

(looks hard at Fenton)

I don't believe a word of it, but
what got me is why in the world he'd
make something like that up. That's
why I brought him over here myself.

DAD
(sighs)
I don't know why he made it up.
Probably to get back at me for
punishing him earlier.

Did you tell him about that?

 

FENTON

Fenton jumps up and grabs Small's arm.

FENTON
Check the shed! Or the Rose Garden!
I can show you where they're buried!

Smalls looks to Dad. Dad shrugs.

DAD
Maybe you should check the shed.

DEPUTY SMALLS
I know there's nothing out there.

Well, it won't hurt none. Maybe
even calm him down a bit.

a thud. Fenton runs to him and sees the blood flowing from
the huge gash in his chest. He is still alive. He looks
down at his wound, confused, and then up at Fenton. He tries
to say something, but can't form the words. There are
FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Fenton looks up and sees Dad coming
down the steps with the axe in his hand. Fenton moves back ~~
in fear. Dad reaches the bottom of the stairs and looks at
the dazed Deputy who is looking right back at him. He lifts
the axe, but there are tears in his eyes.

DAD
May God welcome you and keep you.

He brings the axe down. Smalls' legs twitch a little and
then stop. Dad throws the bloody axe to the floor, and
then turns and vomits. Fenton watches him.

EXT. ROSE GARDEN -- LATER

Fenton digs a hole as Dad sits on the ground, wiping tears
from his eyes. Smalls' body lays on the ground a few feet
away from Dad.

Adam also digs a hole a little further away from them. Beside
Adam there are three black trashbags. He finishes his first
hole, dumps the contents of one of the trashbags into it,

and then starts to dig another hole.

Fenton finishes his hole, sticks his shovel in the ground,
and looks at Dad who is still crying, though silently. Dad
notices Fenton, and looks away.

DAD
I never killed a man until tonight.

FENTON ,
I've seen you kill plenty.

Dad looks up hard at Fenton, and there is hate for the first
time in his eyes.

DAD
Those were demons you heathen! Demons!

Adam stops digging and looks over at them.

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

DAD (CONT'D)
{points to the corpse)
That was a man! Not a demon! Why
can't you see that?! What's wrong
with you?! Why can't you see it?!

FENTON
You didn't have to kill hin.

DAD
I had to protect our mission. I
told you what would happen if you
teld! But you told anyway!

FENTON
There is no mission! You're crazy!

Dad jumps up and goes for Fenton. Fenton tries to back up,
but is too slow. Dad grabs him by the arms.

ADAM
(cries)
Dad don't!

DAD
That man is dead because of you!
Dead because you have no faith!
Don't you understand what you've
done! ?

FENTON
I didn't do anything!

He pulls him into his face.

DAD
You've made me a murderer Fenton! A
murderer!

He throws Fenton to the ground. He grabs the shovel and
raises it above his head. Adam screams. Fenton covers his
head, readying himself for the blow. Dad holds the shovel,
his face dark with rage. He lets out a cry, throws the shovel
to the ground, and collapses on the ground sobbing.

DAD (CONT'D)
Oh God help me. Help me God. Please
help me.

Adam goes to him and puts an arm around him. Fenton watches
him cry without any emotion.

ADAM
It's alright Dad. Don't cry.

co Fenton gets up and pushes Smalls' body into the hole. Adam
iu looks at Fenton and frowns. Fenton starts to cover him up
with dirt.

EXT. HOUSE -- LATER

Fenton walks across the road from the garden, carrying his
shovel. Dad and Adam follow behind him. The patrol car is
still parked in front of the house. Fenton reaches the house
before them, and starts to climb the porch steps. Dad looks
at the patrol car and sighs.

DAD
(calls to Fenton)
Wait a minute Fenton.

Dad and Adam walk up to him on the porch.
DAD (CONT'D)
(to Adam}
Go on inside son. I'll be there in
a minute to tuck you in.
Adam looks at Dad then at Fenton.

DAD (CONT'D)
Go on. It's alright. You did good.

 

Adam smiles weakly at Dad.

ADAM
It was easy.
(to Fenton)
I destroyed a demon.

DAD
(rubs his head)
You sure did tiger.

Adam passes Fenton on the steps and goes inside the house.
Dad watches him go and then turns to Fenton.

DAD (CONT'D)
Come on around back to the shed.

He walks off, and after a moment Fenton follows him.

Ao
 

 

INT. SHED -- MOMENTS LATER

The door is open. Dad stands at his workbench, cleaning off
the axe blade with a rag. Fenton walks into the doorway,
but lingers there when he sees Dad with the axe.

DAD
(not looking up)
Come inside and shut the door.

Fenton hesitates for a moment, and then does as he is told.
Dad looks up at him, sees the fear.

DAD (CONT'D)
Are you afraid?

Fenton nods.

DAD (CONT'D)
Of what?
FENTON
(beat)
You.
DAD

Only demons should fear me.

He takes a step toward Fenton, holding the axe casually.

DAD (CONT'D)
And you're not a demon.
(beat)
Are you?

Fenton backs up a step, eyeing the axe.

DAD (CONT'D)
The angel said you were.

Fenton looks at him with new terror.

DAD (CONT'D)
That night before I had you dig the
hole. Said you were a demon down
deep. That me and Adam couldn't see
it, but that we would in time. Said
it was why you wouldn't help us.

They stare at each other for a long moment. Dad tosses the
axe to the side of the shed.

DAD (CONT'D)
But I don't believe that. I...1
just can't. You're my son, and I
love you more than my own life.

Fenton visibly relaxes.

DAD (CONT'D)
You know what's funny about this
situation Fenton? I'm afraid of
you.

He walks to the cellar hatch, bends down on his knees, and
opens it. He looks down into the darkness of the cellar
with a frown.

DAD (CONT'D)
I don't understand you, and that
scares me. I can't trust you, and
that scares me even more. You're
the only part of this whole thing
that doesn't make sense to me.

He straightens himself and looks over at Fenton.

DAD (CONT'D)
Go on. Get down there.

Dad nods to the steps. Fenton looks down into the dark
cellar, and then at Dad.

DAD (CONT'D)
Go on.

FENTON
But...

DAD
I don't want to do this Fenton, but
I have to after tonight. I had to
kill a man because of you. I won't
let that happen again.

FENTON
I promise I won't tell again.

DAD
I can't trust you. I wish I could,
but I can't. Now go on.

FENTON
Please Dad, I'm sorry.

DAD
I'm sorry too, Son.
(sternly)
Now go on before I put you down there
myself.

FENTON
But...but it’s dark down there.

DAD
I don't have time to argue. I've
still got to clean up the mess you -
caused tonight. Now go on.

FENTON
Let me take the lantern.

DAD
(shakes his head no)
Go.

Fenton makes a run for it, but Dad grabs him by the arn,
picks him up, and carries him down the opened hatch as he
kicks and screams.

INT. CELLAR -- CONTINUOUS

Dad puts him down at the bottom of the steps. He tries to
run up the steps, but Dad pushes him back.

DAD
You'll stay down here until you see
the truth.

Dad walks quickly up the stairs. Fenton scrambles toward
the hatch, but Dad closes it on him, leaving him in total
darkness. He beats his fists on the hatch door, crying.

FENTON
I'm sorry! Please Dad! Please!

He hears Dad put the pad lock on the hatch.

DAD (0.5S.)
Pray for a vision son. Only God can
show you the truth. Pray to Him
Fenton. Only He can help you now. .

He hears Dad walk off, and the shed door shut behind him.
Fenton collapses on the steps in tears. He wraps his arms
around himself, and screams.

INT. SHED -- DAY

Adam opens the shed door and comes in carrying a big cup.
He goes to the hatch door, puts the cup on it, and gets on
his hands and knees beside it.

ADAM
(to the hatch)
Fenton?

INT. CELLAR -- CONTINUOUS

It is completely dark except for a few tiny shafts of light
around the hatch door. Fenton lays underneath the hatch
door, curled up on the steps.

ADAM (0.S.)
Fenton?

He stirs and looks up.

ADAM (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Fenton? You alright?

Fenton moves closer to the hatch and tries to see through
the cracks, but can't.

FENTON
(rasps)
Adam. Get me out of here.

ADAM (0.S.)
I can't.

INTERCUT BETWEEN FENTON AND ADAM

FENTON
Please, Adam. I'm scared.

ADAM
Dad says you have to stay down there
until God shows you the truth.

FENTON
But I'm hungry and I've got to go to
the bathroom.

ADAM
Dad won't let me feed you. He-says
it'll help you find God. He called
it fasting. I brought you some water
though. He said you can have a cup
a day, but I'll bring more if I can.

“ I can't.

Adam picks up the cup.

ADAM (CONT'D)
Put your mouth by the crack. Here.

He pours a little water on the crack. The water trickles

down it and into the cellar. Fenton puts his mouth by it.

ADAM (CONT'D)
You ready? Here.

He pours more of the water into the crack. Fenton drinks
from the trickle, and let's it wet his face.

“ADAM (CONT'D)
You want some more or you want me to
save it for later?

FENTON
More.

He gradually pours the rest of the cup down the crack and
Fenton drinks it.

 

FENTON (CONT'D)
You've got to let me out of here
Adam.

Adam doesn't respond.

FENTON (CONT'D)
Adam?

ADAM
I've been praying for you Fenton.
We both have. Dad says that you'll
probably be out of there by the end
of the week. You just have to accept
God's will. :

ADAM

He walks away from the hatch door. Fenton hears him walking
out and beats harder.

FENTON
Adam! Please don't go! Please!

He hears the shed door shut, and breaks down into tears.

CUT TO PRESENT:
INT. DOYLE'S CAR -- NIGHT

The rain beats down on the car. Doyle drives as Fenton sits
in the backseat.

FENTON .

The days came and went. I counted

them by the cracks of light in the

hatch door, and Adam's visits with

water. My fear never lessened. I

even pissed and shit myself because '
I was too afraid to leave my little

spot by the stairs.

DOYLE
That's awful.

FENTON
The hunger and the stink helped me
forget the fear for awhile, but it
always came crashing back. You would
have thought that I would have
eventually gotten over my fear of
the dark, but I didn't. I was
terrified the entire time. I only
slept when I passed out from
exhaustion and fatigue.

DOYLE
What about your Dad? Did he ever
come back to at least check on you?

FENTON
On the seventh day.

CUT TO FLASHBACK:
 

INT. CELLAR -~ NIGHT

The hatch door opens and light shines down into the darkness,
revealing Fenton laying in his spot. He lifts his head weakly
and squints at the figure standing above the hatch, looking
down at him. Dad's face is filled with misery as he looks

at his son.

DAD
Has God spoken to you yet?

Fenton tries to stand, but falls back down. He lifts his
head up and looks Dad right in the eyes.

FENTON
(rasps)
There is no God.

Dad stands there for a long moment, looking sadly at Fenton.
He shuts the hatch and the light disappears into total
darkness. The sound stops. There is no light or sound at
all. There is nothing but pitch black darkness.

FENTON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I lost count of the days after that.
It felt like weeks. I finally went
beyond fear into total insanity. I
saw God. He had finally sent me a
vision alright. It was like that
line in Acts, "Immediately something
like scales fell from Saul's eyes
and he could see again." And it was
then that I understood my destiny
just like Dad had said I would.

There is a SPLASH sound, and light from the opened hatch
falls on Fenton. He is drenched and laughing hysterically.
Dad is shaking him, and calling his name.

DAD
(worried)
Fenton! Fenton!

Adam stands at the top of the stairs crying. Suddenly Fenton
stops laughing. Dad and Adam both freeze. There is a perfect
moment of silence. Fenton looks up at Dad and smiles weakly.

FENTON
{croaks)
I saw God Dad.

Dad looks at him for a long moment, and a big smile spreads
slowly over his face.

He pulls Fenton to him, tears of joy in his eyes, and caresses
his head.

: DAD
Oh thank you God. Thank you.

Adam jumps up and down with excitement, clapping his hands.
INT. KITCHEN -- LATER
Fenton, now cleaned up and in fresh clothes, sits at the
kitchen table eating a plate of food. Dad and Adam watch --
him as he devours the food.
DAD
(smiles)
Slow down there. You don't want to
make yourself sick.
Fenton tries to slow down a little, but can't help himself.
ADAM
(excited) .
So did God tell you about the demons?
Fenton nods with his mouthful. Dad smiles proudly.

FENTON
I'm sorry I doubted you Dad.

Dad reaches out and tousles his hair.

DAD
I'm sorry too son.

They smile at each other.

ADAM
What'd God look like?

FENTON
It's hard to describe.
ADAM
Was he big?
DAD

Adam, leave him alone. He can't
tell you something like that. You
have to see it for yourself.

ADAM
But I want to know.

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED: 44

DAD
Then maybe you should pray for it.

ADAM
(pouting)
It's not fair. All I've seen are
angels and he gets to see God.

DAD
Look at the price he paid for it
though.

Dad looks at Fenton devouring his food. He almost frowns,
but forces a smile instead.

DAD (CONT'D)
But that's all behind us now. This
is a new day. Isn't it. Fenton?
Fenton smiles and nods with his mouthful.

ADAM
So we gonna go get us a demon now?

DAD
After awhile. When Fenton's ready.

INT. VAN -- EVENING
Dad drives. A ballgame plays softly on the radio. Fenton
sits in the passenger seat, looking at a map. Adam sits in
the back.
FENTON (V.0.)

A week later I was ready. I remember

it was a Friday night near the very

end of summer. My first demon was

to be Brad White from Dallas.

Fenton puts down the map and looks through the windshield at
the lights and buildings of downtown Dallas in the distance.

EXT. STREET -- LATER
The van drives slowly down the street.
INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Dad drives looking at the numbers on the houses. Fenton
points at one.

FENTON
There it is.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

It is a small house with a beat-up car sitting in the
driveway. Dad pulls the van down the street, turns around,
and parks by the curb. They all three stare at the house.
Dad turns on his flashers and looks over at Fenton.

DAD
You sure you're ready for this?

FENTON
(solemnly)
Yes sir.

Dad smiles at him, and puts on his gloves. He pulls out a
second pair of gloves and hands them to Fenton.

DAD
I've been saving them for you. You
might need them now that God has
spoken to you.

Fenton takes them and puts them on.

DAD (CONT'D)
Alright, let's go.

He reaches between the seats and pulls out the lead pipe.

ADAM
I want to go, too.

DAD
Not this time Adam.

Adam looks disappointed.

DAD (CONT'D)
Don't worry your time will come.

Dad and Fenton open their doors and get out.
EXT. HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Fenton and Dad walk up to the porch. The porch-light is
off, but there is a light on inside, and a television can be
heard. They reach the front door. Dad knocks. They hear
someone moving around inside and coming to the door. Fenton
looks up at Dad who smiles reassuringly. A man in his mid-
thirties, BRAD WHITE, opens the door, and looks at them.

BRAD
Yeah?

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED: tol
DAD
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've
got a flat tire.

He points to the van with its flashers going. Brad looks
out and. sees it.

DAD (CONT'D)
I was wondering if you had a tire
iron. I went off and left mine at
home.
Brad looks at Dad and then at Fenton.

BRAD
What's with the gloves?

DAD
To change the tire.

BRAD
(smirks)
Don't want to get your hands dirty?

WOMAN (0.S.)
Brad! Who is it?

Brad turns and shouts back into the house.

BRAD
Mind your business bitch!

Brad turns back to them and gives Dad a look.

BRAD (CONT'D)
Goddamn women.

Dad forces a smile.

BRAD (CONT'D)
Yeah, I think I got one for you.

He walks out and shuts the door behind him.

BRAD (CONT'D)
Come on. It's around back.

Fenton and Dad follow him off the porch and around the house.
EXT. GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Brad walks up to the garage and opens the door. There is
stuff all over the place inside of it.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: fez

BRAD
Now let's see.

He flicks on a light and starts to rummage through the place.
Dad watches him and slowly pulls the pipe from his back.
Fenton looks over and sees a hammer laying on the floor.

Dad gets behind Brad and raises the pipe.

BRAD (CONT'D)
Here it is.

Just as Dad is about to bring it down on his head, Fenton -
accidentally knocks over something, and Brad looks up and
sees Dad with the pipe. He dodges, and Dad misses him.

BRAD (CONT'D)
Motherfucker!

Brad brings the tire iron up and hits Dad in the stomach.
Dad doubles over. He raises the tire iron to hit Dad again,
but cries out in pain and grabs the back of his neck. He
turns and sees Fenton holding the hammer.

BRAD (CONT'D)
You little son of a bitch!

He raises the tire iron, but suddenly falls forward revealing
Dad with the pipe. Dad holds his stomach in pain and looks
at Brad unconscious on the floor.

DAD
Grab his legs.

INT. VAN -- LATER

Dad drives down the highway. Fenton sits in the passenger
seat staring out the window. Adam is in the back taping
Brad's hands and legs. He finishes and slaps an extra piece
of tape over his mouth.

ADAM
All done.

Dad turns to look and winces. Fenton notices.

DAD
Is it good and tight?

ADAM
Yep.

could've been worse. We might not
have got him.

FENTON
I thought God was supposed to protect _
us.

DAD
He did.

(smiles proudly)
God was working through you tonight
kiddo.

Fenton looks back at Brad out cold on the floorboard.

DAD (CONT'D)
I have to admit I was a little worried
earlier, but now I know everything
is going to be alright. I'm proud
of you Fenton.

EXT. HOUSE -- LATER

The van pulls up in the driveway. Fenton gets out and opens
the side door. Adam is asleep, but Brad is awake. He looks
right at Fenton. Dad comes around the side of the van and
sees that Brad is awake. He puts on his gloves.

DAD
Let's get him in the cellar.
(to Adam)
Adam, wake up.

He reaches in and shakes him.

DAD (CONT'D)
Come on Adam. Wake up.

Adam mumbles and turns over. Dad looks at him sleeping and
smiles. :

DAD (CONT'D)

Might as well let him sleep. We'll
get him later.

Dad reaches for Brad.
 

ao,

INT. CELLAR -- MOMENTS LATER

 

Dad drops Brad on the floor. Fenton hangs back on the steps,
holding the lantern and the axe. Dad steps back from Brad,
exhausted and holding his stomach. He looks over at Fenton.

DAD
You know son, I've been waiting for
this moment ever since all this
started.

Fenton sets the lantern down and steps forward with the axe, -
looking at Brad.

FENTON
I'm ready to fulfill my destiny.

Dad looks at Fenton, smiles, and walks over to Brad on the
floor, peeling off his gloves. Brad watches Dad and says
something muffled by the tape.

DAD
{looks to Fenton)
You ready?

Fenton nods and moves forward next to Dad. Dad kneels down
next to Brad and grabs him by the arm. Dad's eyes go wide
and so do Brad's. Adam walks down the stairs, sees Dad with
his hands on the demon, and his eyes widen. Fenton lifts
the axe, a look of determination on his face. Dad lets go
of Brad with disgust.

DAD (CONT'D)
(outraged)
Destroy him!

Fenton swings the axe. Brad's eyes widen with shock. Dad
falls back onto the floor with the axe buried in his chest.
Adam screams and runs down the steps. Dad looks at Fenton
with pain.

DAD. (CONT'D)
How...could you...do this?

Fenton stares at him coldly. Tears fall from Dad's eyes.
Adam rushes to Dad's side, crying. Dad puts an arm around
Adam, pulls him close, says something to him, -and dies.
Fenton watches him die, and then turns to Brad and pulls the
tape off of his mouth. Brad looks past him and screams.
Fenton turns to see Adam with the axe raised above his head.
Fenton falls back and closes his eyes and the picture fades
to black as Brad screams.

He cries uncontrollably as Fenton watches him without emotion.

CUT TO PRESENT:

INT. DOYLE'S CAR -~- NIGHT

Doyle drives. Fenton sits in the backseat. They drive along
in silence. There are tears in Fenton's eyes. He looks out
the window at the rain, and wipes at his tears. Doyle glances
at Fenton in the rearview.

DOYLE
You had to do it, you know. He was
a mad dog. He had to be put down.

Fenton stares out the window, and doesn't say anything.

DOYLE (CONT'D)
So what happened then?

FENTON
I buried him in the Rose Garden.

He doesn't say anymore.

DOYLE
You didn't tell anybody?

FENTON
We went to the sheriff about a week
later, right before school started
and told him that Dad hadn't come
home one day.

Doyle waits for him to continue, but he doesn't.

DOYLE
That's it?

FENTON

The sheriff filled out a missing
persons report, but never found
anything. We were sent to separate
orphanages after awhile.

never questioned us about any of it.
He looks back out the window.

DOYLE
So no one ever knew about any of it?

FENTON
Nope. Not until now.

DOYLE
But what about Adam...

FENTON

Do you mind if we just sit here for

awhile? I don't feel like talking

anymore.
Doyle looks frustrated, but doesn't say anything.
EXT. ROAD -- MORNING
The rain has stopped and the sun is beginning to come out,
though it is still very early. Doyle’s car drives down the
empty road in front of the Rose Garden.
INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS
Doyle drives as Fenton looks out the window at the garden.

FENTON
Pull over here.

Doyle pulls the car over. Fenton yawns.

DOYLE |

ago. Let me out.

Doyle gets out and opens the backdoor for him. He reaches
in to give him a hand, but Fenton refuses.

He pulls himself out of the car with the handcuffs on.
EXT. ROSE GARDEN -- MOMENTS LATER

They enter through a narrow gap in the chain link fence near
the back of the garden. Fenton walks off through the wet
weeds to a small, barely noticeable path. Doyle follows.

FENTON
(as they walk)
It's a little further back this way.

DOYLE
But this isn't even in the garden.

He points to the garden in the distance where rosebushes are
lined up in neat symmetrical rows in front of the Rose Museum.

FENTON
I said it was near the back.

They continue to walk, the garden proper disappearing behind
them as they enter a thicket of trees.

DOYLE
You know, you never told me what the
promise was. The one you made to
your brother.

Fenton looks over at him, but keeps walking.

FENTON
It was later that night...

DISSOLVE TO FLASHBACK:
EXT. ROSE GARDEN -- NIGHT

Fenton digs a hole. Adam sits on the ground next to Dad's
corpse, holding him and crying. Fenton finishes digging the
hole, and walks over to the corpse. Adam looks up at him
angrily with tears in his eyes. Fenton pulls Dad away from
Adam and drags him into the hole. He picks up the shovel
and starts to fill the hole. Adam stands over the hole
watching Dad being slowly covered with dirt.

Doyle and Fenton are still walking, though the woods have
become thicker.

that he would bury you here?

FENTON
That's right.

DOYLE

If he ever killed you?

FENTON
Not killed. Destroyed.

Wait a minute.

Doyle stops walking.

DOYLE (CONT'D)
That doesn't make sense.

Fenton stops and turns to him.

FENTON
It does if the man in front of you

Doyle stares at him for a moment and then goes for his gun.
Adam stands calmly where he is, watching him. Doyle raises
the gun and levels it on him.

DOYLE
{still confused)
So you're the killer?

ADAM
No. I told you before. I've never
killed anyone in my life. Fenton
was the killer.

DOYLE
Stop playing games and tell me the
truth!

ADAM

The game is over. You'll understand
soon. Just let me show you where I
buried Fenton. We're almost there.

He points to a clearing up ahead. Doyle looks unsure, but
nods after a moment.

DOYLE
You take it slow or I swear to God
I'll shoot you.

Adam smiles at him and starts to slowly walk in the direction
of the clearing. Doyle follows, keeping the gun aimed at
him. They reach the large clearing where a few giant
rosebushes stand.

ADAM
This is it. This is the spot.

There are literally dozens and dozens of spots on the ground

where the grass has been uprooted and holes have been dug

and filled in. The covered holes are all in little clusters

of threes. Adam points to one of the fresher clusters, where
a shovel lays next to it.

ADAM (CONT'D)
That's where I buried him.

Doyle studies the ground.

There's too many holes here. There
were only six victims.

Doyle looks at him, but Adam stares at Fenton's three graves.

ADAM (CONT'D)
That night I went to Fenton's house
was the first time I had seen him
since we were kids. I didn't even ~-
know he lived so close to me until
he showed up on my list.

CUT TO FLASHBACK:
EXT. FENTON'S HOUSE (PREVIOUSLY ADAM'S HOUSE) -- NIGHT

It is the same house from the very beginning. All the lights
to the house are off except for a dim light in the front
window. Johnny Cash's Peace in the Valley plays softly from
inside the house. Adam stands in the driveway, holding a
lead pipe in his gloved hand, looking at the house.

INT. FENTON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Fenton (previously Adam) sits at a small desk in the corner
of the living room, typing on an old typewriter. The song
plays on an old record player on the other side of the room.
He hums along with it as he types. On ‘the desk there are
two stacks of paper. Taped to the wall in front of the desk
are several newspaper clippings from the God's Hand case and
a single piece of paper with seven names on it, six of them
crossed out. Fenton pulls the piece of paper out of the
typewriter, puts it on top of one of the stacks of paper,
takes another sheet from the other stack, puts it in the
typewriter, and starts to type again.

 

ADAM (0.S.)
Fenton Meeks.

Fenton whirls around barely in time to see Adam bringing the
pipe down on his head.

INT. FENTON'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Fenton lays on the floor with his hands and feet taped.
There is a trickle of blood on his forehead. Adam leans on
the desk, the axe next to him, watching him. Fenton opens
his eyes, dazed, tries to move, but can't. He looks around
and sees Adam. He looks at him for a long moment.

. (CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED:

FENTON
So you finally came for me.

ADAM
God finally came for you.

FENTON
I knew this day would come.

ADAM
I've prayed for the past twenty years
that it wouldn't, but I guess I knew
it too.

FENTON
Dad would be so proud of you. You
always were his favorite. You even
look kind of like him, you know it?

ADAM
(not looking at him)
Why did you leave the notes?

FENTON
To lure you to me and get this whole
thing over with once and for all. 1
just couldn't take it anymore. I
like to be the hunter not the hunted.
I knew when those killings made the
news, you'd track me down. I have
to admit though, I didn't expect you
to wait so long. Six people. You
let six people die before you came
after me.

ADAM
I came only when God put you on my
ist. To come before then would
have been murder.

FENTON
You might call it something else,
but you're a murderer just like me.
The only difference is you kill for
God and I kill because I like it.
The look in their eyes as they die,
the way the blood feels on my flesh.
It makes me feel good.

ADAM
Did killing Dad make you feel good?

FENTON
(half sings)
It put that joy joy joy joy down in
my heart.

Adam looks away from him, fighting his emotions.

FENTON (CONT'D)
C'mon Adam, you're supposed to say
where remember?

Adam pulls off one of his gloves. _.

FENTON. (CONT'D)
I guess that's not your favorite
song anymore.

Fenton looks at Adam's bare hand, and smiles sadistically.

FENTON (CONT'D)
Remember the look in Dad's eyes that
night?

ADAM
Yeah, I remember.

Adam takes off his other glove and tosses them both down on
the desk. Fenton watches him.

FENTON

I should have killed you when I first
got to town, but that was too easy.
I had to have you come for me.

(laughs bitterly)
I guess I forgot that God protects
you. But he didn't protect all those
people I killed in the past twenty
years. And he sure didn't protect
Dad, did he?

Adam walks around Fenton, takes a roll of tape out of his
pocket, and tears off a big piece.

ADAM
God asked Dad to destroy his own son
much like he asked Isaac to sacrifice
his own son to test his faith. But.
Dad couldn't do it. He loved his
son, demon or not.

He reaches down and slaps the tape on Fenton's mouth.

ADAM (CONT'D)
He simply could not do what God had
asked of hin.

He walks to the desk and picks up the axe.

ADAM (CONT'D)
And God didn't take pity on Dad like
he did with Isaac.

He walks back over to Fenton and looks him right in the eye.

ADAM (CONT'D)
But that was back at a time when God
had pity.

Adam reaches a hand out toward him.

CUT TO PRESENT:
EXT. ROSE GARDEN -- MORNING
Doyle stares at him for a long moment.

DOYLE
(softly)
Jesus Christ, you really do believe
all that stuff.

ADAM
I've always believed.

DOYLE
I told you my instincts were always
right. I knew there was something
about you.

ADAM
So you think you've finally figured
out what I've been hiding all this
time? Do you know my secret?

Doyle looks at him for a long moment and shakes his head in
disgust.

DOYLE
You're insane, you know that Fenton.
or Adam or whoever you are? And
these little stories you've been
telling me all night are just as
crazy.

DOYLE (CONT'D)
And I honestly don't care which ones
are true and which ones aren't.
Maybe I'll figure that out later,
maybe not. But right this minute
all I need to know is that you're a
sick murderer and I've got you.

ADAM
Maybe, but that's not going to bring
back your mother is it? She's dead
and her killer got away. Didn't he? -_
Doyle looks hard at him and he smiles.

DOYLE
You son of a...

He rushes at him. Adam puts out his handcuffed hands and
touches Doyle right as he gets close enough. Doyle stops
and both of their eyes go wide. .

Doyle drops the gun in a daze. Adam quickly reaches into
Doyle's pocket, takes out his keys, and un-handcuffs himself.

DOYLE (CONT'D)

How...how did you do that?
Adam reaches out and grabs his arm.

ADAM
God knew. You were on my list.
That's why I brought you out here.

Adam pushes him towards one of the rosebushes.

INTO HER

Adam bends down and picks up the axe that is hidden under
the bush, and pushes him...

INSERT: BLOOD SPLATTERS THE SHEETS ON THE LINE

...behind the bush where there is a freshly dug hole. Doyle
falls into the hole. He seems to snap out of it and his
eyes widen in fear when he sees Adam standing over him with
the axe. He struggles to stand.

DOYLE :
You...You can't do this! I'm...I'm
an FBI agent. They'll come looking
for me!

ADAM
No they won't. They'll keep looking
for Fenton. You're going to be his
last victim. God has willed it.
DOYLE
But...but you've been seen! They'll
know it was you!
Adam knocks him back down with his foot, and lifts the axe.

ADAM
God will protect me.

He brings the axe down.
INT. CAR -- LATER

Adam drives Doyle's car down the highway, turning the radio
dial until he finds an old country and western station.

EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- LATER
Adam pulls into the parking lot next to the ambulance, and

gets out of the car. He gets into the ambulance, starts it,
and pulls off.

INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- LATER

The operator sits at her desk still reading the novel from
earlier. The phone rings, and as she reaches for it a folded
piece of paper falls out of the book. She answers the phone,
transfers the call, and then unfolds the paper. She reads
the typed words, "God's hand has taken William Doyle." Her
eyes widen. She drops the paper on her desk and grabs the
phone. ‘Next to the piece of paper is the book. The cover
has a picture of single red rose with the title Frailty above
it, and the words by Fenton Meeks underneath it.

INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS
Adam drives down the highway singing with the radio.
INT. FBI OFFICE -- LATER

The place is buzzing with activity now. Agents come and go
down the hallway. Inside one of the offices, Agent Hull,

the operator, and TWO AGENTS are gathered around a video
monitor. Hull fast-forwards the tape until he sees something.
He stops it and pushes play.

HULL
There he is.

The monitor shows a man walking into the reception area, but
it is impossible to make out his face. He moves out of frame.
Hull fast-forwards again until the man walks back into frame.
He lets it play, and the man walks to the operator, gives

her the book, and then turns toward the camera.

HULL (CONT'D)
We got him now.

As the man turns toward the camera there is a glitch and he
moves out of frame without revealing his face.

HULL (CONT'D)
What?!

He rewinds, watches it again, but the glitch is still there.

HULL (CONT'D)
Goddamnit!

AGENT 1
Are you sure neither one of you can
remember what he looked like?

The operator and Hull both shake their heads.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

CONTINUED:

HULL
I told you it's just a blur. I can't
understand it. I looked right at
him, shook his hand.

AGENT 2
Well, we're running the name he gave
you now.

AGENT 1

It's got to be a fake name.

AGENT 2
Maybe. Pretty weird one though.
Fenton Meeks?

The operator looks up.

OPERATOR
Fenton Meeks? That's the name on
the book! The one I found the note
in.

All the agents look at her.
EXT. FENTON'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Several FBI agents position themselves around the house.
Hull gives the signal and they storm the place.

INT. FENTON'S HOUSE -~ MOMENTS LATER

Hull comes in after the other agents have secured the place,
and walks through the house. He walks to the desk and looks
down at the old typewriter, phonebooks, and the stacks of
papers next to it. He reads the top page. It reads "God's
hand has taken Karen Levy.”

HULL
Son of a bitch.

He flips through the other papers and they all have the same
thing typed on them except the names are different on each
one. He notices the list taped on the wall, but this time
all seven names are crossed out on it. He pulls it off the
wall and sees that the last name is William Doyle as one of
the agents walks up to him, carrying something.

AGENT

There's no one here sir. We found
this in the basement.

He holds it out in his plastic-gloved hand and reveals that
it is a bloody wallet with Doyle's picture ID on one side
and his badge on the other. There is a blood stain on the

_ picture. Hull frowns.

HULL
Is...is he down there too?

AGENT
(shakes his head)
Not him.

INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

The door near the far wall is opened, revealing a set of
steps that lead down. Hull goes down the stairs. The other
agents in the kitchen watch him.

HULL (0.S.)
(yells in disgust)
Jesus Christ!

The other agents shuffle uncomfortably as they hear him vomit.
INT. MEAT POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY

Agent Hull enters and walks up to the reception desk. A
woman is turned, filing something.

HULL
Excuse me.

The woman turns and we see that it is the same pregnant blonde
woman that Doyle spoke to earlier on the phone. She smiles.

WOMAN
I didn't even hear you come in. How
can I help you?

HULL
I'm with the FBI. I need to speak
to the sheriff, is he in?

WOMAN
Sure thing.

 

She swivels around in her chair.

WOMAN (CONT'D)
Sheriff!
{back to Hull)
You want some coffee or something?-

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HULL
wo™ No I'm fine. Thanks.

Officer Henderson comes in from the front door. Hull turns
to him and they nod hello at each other. Hull turns back to
the sound of a door opening and sees Adam, dressed in a police
uniform, come out of the office. Surprisingly, there is
absolutely no recognition in Hull's eyes or in Adam's.

HULL (CONT'D) ~-
Sheriff Meeks?

ADAM
Yes?

They shake hands.

HULL
I'm Agent Hull of the FBI. I need
to ask you some questions about your

brother.
ADAM
(taken aback)
Fenton?

Hull nods solemnly.

 

EXT. MEAT POLICE DEPARTMENT -- LATER
Hull walks out the door of the station followed by Adam.

ADAM
Well, I appreciate you coming by to
tell me personally. I...I don't
know what to say.

HULL
It's got to be hard. I just wanted
you to know before we go public.

ADAM
Well if there's anything I can do...

HULL
I think we've got it pretty well
covered from here. But again if you
can think of where he might have
gone or if he contacts you...

Ss Of course.

ADAM

He extends his hand and Adam shakes it.

HULL
_ Take care sheriff.

Hull tries to pull his hand away, but Adam holds it for a
brief moment and looks him right in the eye.

ADAM
You're a good man Agent Hull.

Hull looks at him strangely but smiles, and Adam lets go of -
his hand. Hull gets into his car, starts it, and drives :
off. Adam watches as he pulls away. The woman comes out.

ROMAN
Adam? Is everything okay?

He turns and smiles at her.

ADAM
Everything's fine Mary.

He goes to her and kisses her.

ADAM (CONT'D)
God's will has been served.
AE She smiles at him. He reaches down and caresses her pregnant
Se stomach.
MARY

Praise God.
A beam of light shines down on them from the heavens above.
