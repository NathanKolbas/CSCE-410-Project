1 INT. CRISTINA'S ROOM ’-- DAY : 1

Male and female clothing is strewn around an upper middle class
room, decorated in good taste. A leather jacket hangs draped over
a chair and a lead blue dress lies on the floor.

half covered by the sheets, barely lit by the light coming through

_ the window.

Fade in to a soda fountain with white walls and red booths. The
walls are hung with images of their products: milkshakes, sodas,
hamburgers.

Michael (37) - dressed informally with a pleasant, relaxed face -
sits at a table with his daughters: Laura (5) and Katie (4). Both
look very pampered.

Laura slurps her chocolate milkshake through a straw.

MICHAEL
Sweetie, don’t slurp.

LAURA
Why?

MICHAEL

It sounds awful.
 

LAURA
Daddy! But the bottom’s the yummiest
part!

<> She slurps again. Michael shakes his head in mild disapproval.

MICHAEL
Hurry up: mom’s waiting for us.

Katie starts blowing into her straw, making bubbles.

KATIE
Look daddy, a volcano..

MICHAEL
Your volcano's very pretty, but finish

CRISTINA

Last night I was watching "Cinderella"
with my daughters when suddenly Laura,
the older one, asked me why neither
Cinderella nor "Beauty", nor Ariel
had mothers and goddammit, she was
right: there are no mothers in
Disneyland. And they know about their
grandma, that I was a motherless
child, and they're scared to death
that they'll lose me and I don't
know what to tell them because I'm .
just as fucking afraid.

Afraid of losing control, of ending
up in a hospital again, dying from
an overdose.

She remains meditative for a few seconds. It is obvious that she
is in pain, but will not-cry.

my daughters and Michael, and they
love me, and I love them, and I know
I can't fail them, I just can't...

She remains silent. It seems as if she wants to say something
else, but she just smiles painfully.

4 INT. RELIGIOUS CENTER ROOM -- DAY

Jack (35) is a strong, wiry man, with a‘closely shaven face and
wolfish features. He wears blue jeans, a short-sleeved shirt.

The phrase “Jesus loves you" is tattooed on his left forearm. On

Paul -with a grown beard, slightly long hair, and wearing a white
robe- is half sitting on a bed in the Intensive Care Unit of a
modest clinic.

He is connected to a respirator, with an I.V. in his left arm and
electrodes attached to his chest. A discontinuous green line jumps
in a monitor.

Mary (38) with vigorous, sweet eyes- is lying on a gynecologist‘s

examining table, with her legs open on the stirrups. A

in the eyes.

GYNECOLOGIST
You can get dressed now.

8 INT. GYNECOLOGISTS OFFICE -~ DAY

Mary is sitting before the gynecologist in a nicely decorated,
but not over-luxurious, office. The doctor looks over some charts.

GYNECOLOGIST
For how long have you been trying to
get pregnant?

MARY
A year anda half.
(Worried)
Is there something wrong?

The doctor looks at her and hesitates before answering.
 

GYNECOLOGSIT
I’m afraid so. Your uterus and
fallopian tubes are severely damaged.
It looks like you had an infection
that was not taken care of.

Hadn't this been detected before?

They'd mentioned something, but...

Mary looks troubled. She turns to look at the doctor.

GYNECOLOGIST
We can operate and hope you get
pregnant in three or four months.

MARY

irony)
He's got one month left... at most.
The doctor looks at her, speechless.

12 EXT. MOTEL SWIMMING POOL -- DAY

Paul is sitting on an old pool chair made of interlaced plastic
strips. His face is filthy with dust and sweat.

Absorbed, he stares at the empty pool, the bottom covered with

branches, dry leaves and dirt. Behind him are the rooms of a dusty

desert motel. Far off we can hear the coos of a mourning dove.

Cristina (dressed as she was in Sc.6 where she snorts the cocaine)

13 INT. PRISON HALLWAY -~ DAY

Jack walks down the hallway of a large jail, escorted by two
guards. Many inmates mock him through the bars.

INMATE 1
What happened? Jesus don't love you
no more?

INMATE 2

Hey Wolf: you're back motherfucker.

Jack pays no attention. His serious, concentrated stare contrasts
with their babbling.

.They reach a cell. One of the guards opens it and signals Jack to

(geet inside.

12.

There is no religious imagery inside the hall. There are no pews,
only twelve metal chairs against the walls where two or three old
women sit.

They all repeat John’s words in unison.

16 INT. BEDROOM, PAULS APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

Paul is lying on his bed watching the news on T.V. in a well
furnished, but unpretentious, apartment. He looks very thin, some
15 pounds underweight, ragged and pale.

He breathes oxygen through a tube connected to his nose from a
green tank on wheels.

He sits up with difficulty and turns off the T.V. He fixes his
robe and stands up taking care not to get tangled. He walks into
the bathroom, trailing the tank behind him.

17 INT. BATHROOM, PAUL’S APARTMENT DAY/EVENING

He locks the door. In front of the mirror are several photographs
of babies and on the sink there is a rubber ducky. Paul looks at
.it and puts it back in its place.

Inside there is a cigarette and a lighter. Paul takes the tubing
out of his nose and lights the cigarette. He breathes in deeply
and exhales the smoke with great pleasure.

Noises. Paul pricks up his ear. He gives the cigarette a long
drag, opens the window and flicks it out.

He tries to push the smoke out of the window with his hands.

MARY

Paul shrugs his shoulders.. She gets upset.

MARY (CONT'D)
For fuck's sake Paul. Don't you
realize the state you're in?

Paul puffs, unaffected. Mary starts to search under one of the
sofa's cushions and can't find anything. She goes over to a
different couch and finds a plastic tube like the one Paul opened
in the bathroom.

PAUL
If I don't smoke I'll go nuts. I'm
Cy sick of being locked up in here.

Paul is aying “on a mobel _xoom floor (the..same as where Cristina
snorted the coke in Sc.6), with a gunshot wound in his chest. He
is barefoot and his shirt is soaked in blood.

Cristina is bent over him, trying to rouse him. She turns to Jack
who is standing at one end of the room with his forearm torn and
covered in clotting blood, his face and body beaten.

CRISTINA
Call an ambulance.

Jack remains motionless, stunned.

CRISTINA (CONT’D)
(Screaming)
Call an ambulance, goddamit.

Jack is motionless for a few more seconds. He goes toward Paul,
bends down and looks at him.

JACK
There’s not enough time, we have to
take him to the hospital.

Without another word, he grabs Paul by the shoulders and starts
dragging him outside.
 

CRISTINA
What are you doing? You’re going to
kill him.

QO Jack pays no attention and keeps dragging Paul, leaving a thick

trail of blood on the floor. Cristina runs toward him and carries
Paul's feet to help him.

21 EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT ~~ CONTINUOUS 22

A small group of curious onlookers (some half-dressed couples, a
woman in her fifties) surround the room. Jack and Cristina carry
Paul out, bleeding.

Stumbling from Paul's weight, they finally reach a 99 Ford Focus.
Cristina realizes she doesn’t have the car keys. She lets go of
Paul and runs toward the room.

Jack hesitates for a moment. He snatches the keys from Cristina,
and, with his hand stained with Paul’s blood, opens the driver’s
door.

22 EXT. CRISTINAS HOUSE -- DAY 22

Paul is standing outside Cristina’s house in an upper middle class
residential area. He rings the doorbell repeatedly but no one
opens.

He takes two steps back, stares at the entire house and leaves.
23 EXT. GOLF COURSE ~- DAY 23

Several caddies are chatting, sitting on parked golf carts at the
edge of the golf course.

  

Jack arrives carrying a golf bag. He is dressed in white like the
others, but wears a long-sleeve shirt.

 
 

 

16.

Jack drops the bag heavily next to one of the carts. One of the
caddies makes fun of him.

CADDY 1
What’s the matter? Sticks too heavy
for you?

Jack smiles and grabs his crotch.
JACK '
Just this one. Wanna help me carry
it?

The answer makes the other caddies cackle. One of them points to
a cooler overflowing with beers.

24 INT. HEAD OF CADDIES OFFICE DAY 24

Jack is sitting before Brown (40), the head of caddies. He is
wearing thick glasses, a cheap tie and a blue shirt with sweat
stains around the armpits.

JACK
(Upset)
I know I’m not the best caddy, but
I’m working at it. I’m learning,
Brown, I swear, I.won’t make you
look bad...

BROWN
That's not the problem Jack. The
thing is, some mémbers have been
complaining about your tattoos.

Colsack shows him his shirtsleeve.
JACK
I’ve got a long-sleeve shirt; you
can’t see them.

») Brown gets up and points to a tattoo on Jack’s neck.

BROWN
What about that one? Does your sleeve
cover that one too, or are you going
to start wearing a scarf?

Brown looks out the window and points to some golf players.
BROWN (CONT'D)
Look Jack, this is a club for people
different from you and me, you
understand, right?

Jack looks hurt.

      

Brown, fl don’, ,\t ‘drink, r don’t steal,

Jack looks shocked. He runs his fingers through his hair and stands
up, apparently calm. Brown holds out his hand; Jack just looks at
him scornfully.

BROWN (CONT’D)
Try to understand.

Suddenly, Jack gets a putter from a bag in the corner and feigns
he is about to smash some paintings of old-fashioned golfers.

Brown stands fearless, waiting for him to finish releasing his
anger. Jack doesn’t break the paintings, throws the putter away
and leaves, slamming the glass door behind him. Luckily, it does
not break.

25 INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, CRISTINA'’S HOUSE -- DAY 25

She spreads it out, looks at it painfully, then puts it into the
washing machine.

She keeps pulling out Katie’s clothes and with each one Cristina
seems to break down, but does not cry. The phone starts ringing,
but she pays no attention.

 

Finally, she pulls out a pair of blue sneakers with red shoelaces.
She looks at them for a long time. She puts them to one side and
covers her face with her left hand. The phone will not stop
ringing.

From a suitcase, he pulls out a glass jar in which floats a human
heart. Bewildered, Paul looks at the jar.

Jack's house is humble. The living room is sparsely furnished,
decorated with cheap Wal-mart paintings - vases, boats - all
surrounding a large color photograph of Jack and his family
receiving the keys to the Ford Lobo in front of a Wal-Mart.

A broken electric fan sits in one of the corners. In the center
stands an old television .set - one of the first made with a remote
control.

Marianne is in her living room surrounded by several guests: ex-
convicts (among them the fat man from Sc.9), door-to-door salesmen,
converted young men, women with dyed hair and reverend John.

On the tables are bottles of soda, potato chips, pretzels, but no
alcohol. The only smoker in the room is a squalid, pale young
woman.

The house seems too small for so many guests, and Marianne seems
uncomfortable. She moves from one group of people to the next
almost without talking to anyone. Overwhelmed, Marianne goes to
the kitchen.

38 INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 38

looks around her and checks that no one is watching. She ducks
down and pulls out an open beer from under the sink. She shows it
to Marianne.

PAUL

The gynecologist sighs in disapproval. He opens a drawer and pulls
out a plastic receptacle and a latex glove and gives them to him.

GYNECOLOGIST
You need to put this glove on to
avoid contaminating the pauiple.
Make sure it all lands in the
receptacle.

From a cabinet, he pulls out a Playboy and gives it to Paul.

dented and bloodstained.

He arrives at an empty nursing station. He looks both ways. No

checks it. He doesn't seem to find anything. He closes it and
opens another drawer. As he is checking, he hears a woman's voice
behind him.

DOLORES (0.S.)

born at the hospital in March.

A private investigator (55) bald, with a spade beard- is standing

lets the ball go. There are two pins at the end of the lane. He
only knocks down one of them.

He turns around and smacks his left palm with his right fist.

P.I.
Shit!

He goes to sit down. On one of the chairs is Paul. The P.I. grabs
a beer and drinks. When he's done he wipes his mouth off with the

back of his hand.

Claudia walks in and stares at her.

CLAUDIA

Cristina, challenging, knocks back the entire contents of the
glass and serves herself some more before Claudia's disapproving
stare.

CRISTINA

It is a pretentious restaurant decorated in bad taste, where some
middle class families eat. The P.I. is sitting at a table.

P.I. (CONT'D)
This Jordan guy's really something.
He's been in and out of the joint
since he was 16. The last time they
locked him up was 'cause he let off
a shot while he was mugging someone
and he hit a pregnant woman walking
by. God knows how the woman survived,
but he went fucking nuts with guilt
and punched his cell walls until he
cracked his wrists and hands. He got
out just two years ago.

Paul takes the cutout and looks at it. He pales and starts .
breathing with difficulty. The P.I. is frightened at seeing him
like this.

Jack, Jesus didn't come to free us
from pain. He came to give us the
strength to bear it.

JACK
Jesus wanted this pain for me.

JOHN
He had nothing to do with this, it
was an accident.
Jack lifts his head and looks John in the eyes.
JACK
No, this wasn’t an accident: Jesus
chose me for this...
John stands up and leans against the wall.

JOHN
You're damning your soul; shut up

JACK
Forgive me? I did everything he asked
me to do. I changed, I gave him my
life and he betrayed me...

John looks gravely offended. His eyes light up and he can barely
contain his rage. But Jack keeps staring at John with even more
fiery eyes.

JACK (CONT'D)

96 EXT. BAR STREET -- NIGHT

Cristina's car stops in front of a bar. A valet walks up to her,
opens her door and hands her a ticket. She heads for the bar.

Paul's car also pulls up in front of the bar. He gets out and
another valet hands him a ticket.

97 INT. BAR -- NIGHT

It is the same bar from Sc. 69. It is crowded with 27, 28 year-
olds. Cristina dodges her way around them, makes her way to bar
and calls the bartender.

From the back of the bar, Paul watches Cristina walk toward a
table where Ana is sitting with some other people. On noticing
her arrival, Ana stands up and hugs Cristina enthusiastically.
They talk about something Paul cannot hear.

Ana grabs Cristina by the arm and impels her to follow her.

end up marrying that hunk you brought

CRISTINA
Yes.

ANA
And so, was he a good lay?

Cristina doesn't answer and just swallows. Ana looks at her
cheerfully.

ANA (CONT’D)
It’s busy.

They stop knocking and Ana points at each bag.

ANA (CONT’D)
Angel dust, special K, the oldtime
favorite cocaine and the ‘Newest of

She pulls out a tiny Ziploc bag with several pills and gets off
the sink.

Cristina takes two, looks at Ana and grabs another two. She
swallows all four down with tap water. Ana raises her eyebrows.

ANA (CONT’D)
That’s my girl. Just take it easy on
the booze, ok? We don’t want you
stuck in the other side of heaven.

Cristina looks at her deprecatively. She grabs the bag of coke, a
fistful of pills and puts them in her purse.

100 INT. BATHROOMS JAIL -- NIGHT . 100
The bathrooms are decorated with chipped green and white tiles.

There is a row of open showers. A fat prisoner with an eagle

tattooed on his back bathes in a cloud of steam.

Jack sits barefoot on a bench in front of the showers. He wears a.
white sleeveless t-shirt and prison uniform pants. Taciturn, he
stares at the water running into the drain.

The prisoner finishes and starts to dry himself. He looks at Jack,

Cu wRe is still motionless.

PRISONER
Hurry up: there’s role call at eight.

 
62.

 

Jack doesn’t pay attention. The prisoner covers himself up with
the towel and walks toward the dressing rooms. Jack watches him
leave. He stands up and pulls the bench toward the showers.

 

He stands on the bench, ties one of his shirt-sleeves to the
| showerhead and the other to his neck. He sighs, kicks the bench
away and hangs.

His body is starting to go limp when the showerhead suddenly
breaks. Jack falls on his ass.

Upon hearing the noise, the other prisoner runs into the bathroom.
He finds Jack sprawled out on the tiles, getting soaked by the
water flowing out of the broken showerhead, with his shirt-sleeves
tied around his neck.

When he sees the fat prisoner looking at him worriedly, Jack starts
laughing to himself.

VALET
You're in no condition to drive.

CRISTINA
What the fuck do you care, asshole.

Cristina pushes him, gets in and slams the door shut. She steps
on the accelerator and drives. The valet moves out of the way to
avoid being run over.

Cristina's car goes 20 yards before it rides up on the sidewalk.
The valets and Paul run toward her.

They find her leaning on.the wheel, muttering curses. A valet
puts his hand through the open window and opens the door. Cristina
turns to him, furious.

Cristina sees the patrol car pass and sighs. She looks around
her: there are curious onlookers and valets scrutinizing her. She
is too high and drunk to protest, and docilely slides over to the
copilot seat.

102 INT. CRISTINA’S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER : 102
Paul drives. She sleeps soundly beside him.
They arrive at Cristina's house. Paul searches the visor. for the

105 INT. ROOM JAIL -- DAY 105

Marianne sits in a room with a table and three chairs, lit by a
dusty, bare, 60 watt bulb. It is dark, cold and windowless.

Jack walks in escorted by two guards and sits down in front of
her. The guards retire to the door.

MARIANNE

Lying is a sin, Marianne.

They are quiet for a few seconds. Marianne, nervous, wets her
lips before she goes on.

MARIANNE
I sold the truck to pay for the
lawyer.

JACK

I didn’t ask for a lawyer.

Marianne exhales, exasperated. She opens her purse, takes out her
children’s grade reports and puts them on the table.

MARIANNE
The kids’ grades. Gina did good, but
Freddy had 4 detentions for
misconduct.

The kids need you. I need you..

JACK
I can't leave here...

MARIANNE .
Do you want your children to spend
another five years without you? Is
that what you want?

 

JACK
This is God's will..

MARIANNE
Four years ago you didn't believe in
anything, and now everything has to

She crosses between the two door guards. Jack rests his elbow on
the table and rubs his head.

106 EXT. HALLWAY HIGHWAY MOTEL -- DAY/ DAWN 106

Cristina, dressed in shorts and a black t-shirt, is leaning on
the hallway banister. In-the distance, we can see the lights from
the cars driving down the highway. The sun is about to rise.

She takes long drinks from a bottle of tequila. She pulls out a
plastic bag, opens it: there are several R-2 pills. She takes
four and washes them down with a drink. She turns around to go
into the room.

That was quick.

PT.
Piece of cake, friend. Just a matter
of checking the calls.

He shows him a phone bill where a phone number is highlighted in
yellow. He takes out some photographs of Jack’s police record and
shows them to him.

P.I. (CONT’D)
These are recent photos of Jordan
from his last stay in jail.

Paul looks at them and puts them away.

. PAUL
And what about the other thing?

The P.I. looks at both sides of the street. He opens the glove
compartment and pulls out a red terrycloth that is wrapped around

something.

He puts it on the seat and spreads it out. Inside is a .38 Smith
and Wesson (the same from Sc.12 where Paul shows Cristina the
empty shells) and eight golden bullets.

     
 

 

 

P.t.

Clean gun, no record.

Paul tries to open the cylinder but cannot. The P.I. gestures for
Paul to give him the gun. He skillfully opens the cylinder and
puts the bullets in.

 

He closes the cylinder and leaves the gun loaded.

P.I. (CONT’D)
To shoot you just have to cock it.

He shows him how to do it and then puts the hammer back in place
and hands Paul the loaded gun.

110 REHAB CENTER -- DAY 110

Cristina is in a rehabilitation session. The group listens to a
skinny, unpleasant woman (48) who speaks excitedly on the verge

of crying.

SKINNY WOMAN
They were terrible months. My husband
didn’t even touch me. And I felt
lonely and ugly and I was only happy
when I was at parties where I could
drink and make jokes and have fun...

Cristina listens to her annoyed. She looks uncomfortable.

SKINNY WOMAN (CONT'D)
And I didn't care if my husband got
angry, because he had his things and
I had mine and then I met..

up. She walks toward the door and leaves.

MARIANNE

Freddy is still upset.
FREDDY

Marianne, worried, turns. to Freddy.

MARIANNE
That's stupid.

She throws the hamster cage and goes inside. Her children,
awestruck, run after her.

Cristina looks at him, hesitant. She peers out at the street with
the hope that her taxi will arrive. She only sees cars moving
exasperatingly slowly.

CRISTINA

PAUL
Yep, that.

Cristina gives her vodka a long drink. He watches her.

CRISTINA
And what do you teach them?

PAUL
That numbers aren't cold, that numbers
express life. That numbers sometimes
are an order, sometimes a chaos.
That there's a hidden number in every
act of life, in every manifestation
of the universe, that there's a number
screaming to tell us something. That
a number...

suddenly stops and looks at Cristina.

She is increasingly aroused. Jack, after being distant, is turned
on, takes Marianne's pants off and gets naked.

He turns Marianne face down and starts fucking her roughly ‘and
with no amorous concessions. She seems as if she is on the edge
of enjoying or suffering.

Suddenly Jack: stops, hugs her from behind and starts crying. She
turns to kiss him, but he will not stop crying. He hugs her
forcefully, as if here were going to break her, crying.

strange things. She opens her hand and feels his chest for a few
moments and then rests her ear on it.

She listens for a few moments and then starts to cry softly. Paul
holds her and delicately kisses her on the forehead. He then lowers
his head and kisses her on the mouth.

161 INT. CRISTINA’S ROOM (BEGINNING SC.1) -- DAY 161

Paul and Cristina are lying in bed. Their clothes are strewn about
the room as in Sc.1.

Paul wakes up and looks at Cristina asleep next to him. He sits
on the mattress and lights a cigarette. On the nightstand beside
him he sees a book, a case for glasses, and a male wristwatch.

It is obvious this was Michael’s nightstand. He takes the book;
it is "Cruising Paradise" by Sam Shepard. He leafs through it and
discovers a Polaroid photograph of Michael and Cristina hugging
and smiling.
100.

Paul studies it and puts it back between the pages. He closes the
book, grabs the case and takes out the glasses. He puts them on,
looks through them and then puts them back in their place.

 

He opens the nightstand drawer. Inside is a small plastic bag
with cocaine and some R-2 pills beside it. He moistens his finger,
rubs some coke on his gums and then puts the bag back in the
drawer.

He turns to Cristina and sadly looks at her naked back. He runs
one of his fingers down her back without ceasing to look at her.

Cristina shifts position without waking up. Paul blows out smoke
and brings his hand to his forehead, worried.

one, I've been able to sleep through -
not one minute I don't think about
them.

His voice breaks up. Cristina turns to look at him full of
resentment and rage.

CRISTINA
You let them die lying in the street.
You didn't do anything to help them.

JACK
( ‘ There was nothing I could do and I
/ was scared, very scared.

Jack is desperate, on the verge of crying.

 
 

 

 

JACK (CONT’D)
Forgive me, please. If I could I
would exchange my life for theirs...

Cristina starts crying quietly.

CRISTINA
Your life is useless to me.. It's
just useless...
(a beat)
Take your life somewhere else, if
its of any use to you.

JACK
Please forgive me.. I don't know what
else to do.

Cristina turns to look at him.

bathroom. She opens a backpack and takes out a small baggie filled
with cocaine. She scoops some out with a bottlecap and snorts it.
She sits on the toilet cover, swallows and brings her hands to
her head.

She sighs, stands up and leaves the bathroom.
183 EXT. MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS 183

Cristina walks down the hallways looking for Paul. She spots him
far away, sitting on the old plastic chairs in front of the motel's
empty pool. Far away we hear the coos of a mourning dove.

She walks over to Paul and stands before him. He lifts his hand
to shield his brow from the sun vibrating behind her.

CRISTINA
‘Where were you?

Paul doesn't answer. He pulls out a revolver from his waist, opens
the cylinder and empties out three shells. He puts them on the
glass top of a white iron table. Mesmerized, Cristina examines

one of them.

CRISTINA (CONT'D)
Did you kill him?

Paul nods. Cristina grows pale and runs her left hand through her
hair. They are silent.

CRISTINA (CONT’D)
Why didn’t you wake me up?

Paul doesn’t answer. He just looks out into the horizon.

CRISTINA (CONT’D)
What about the body?

PAUL i
No one will ever find it..

CRISTINA

see his fucking dead face...

She kisses him on the mouth.
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
Let's go home... Let's get out of here.
Paul shakes his head.
PAUL

He coughs and lies on the bed. She caresses him, worried.
185 INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT/ DAWN 185

Paul sleeps. Cristina, awake, stares at the ceiling. She looks
restless. Someone knocks. Cristina is startled. She wakes Paul by
touching his shoulder.

CRISTINA
(Whispering)
There's somebody outside.
 

116.

Paul wakes up. Another knock. He signals for her to be quiet.
Breathing with difficulty, he grabs the revolver and cautiously
Ca toward the window. He looks out: nobody.

He opens the door and looks to one side: nobody. When he is about
to look the other way someone pushes him in. The shove makes him

stumble and he bumps into a table.

Jack bursts into the room. (He is dressed as he was in Sc.172
where he cut his forearm, which is still bleeding.)
JACK
(challenging)
You wanted to kill me motherfucker?

Cristina turns on the light.
JACK (CONT'D)

Paul turns to look at Cristina, but Jack pushes him.

CRISTINA (CONT'D)
You didn't kill him, you bastard...

JACK
Kill me asshole...
CRISTINA
Kill him... kill him.
JACK
You don't have the balls,

CRISTINA

Shoot him...

OO jack slaps the gun out of Paul's hands and headbutts him in the
face, knocking him to the floor.

 
 

Jack turns to Cristina.

CRISTINA (CONT'D)
You killed my family, murderer...

JACK
Here I am..

He lifts up his arms defiantly. Cristina grabs the bedside lamp
“and throws it at him. Jack opens his arms and receives the blow,
unfazed.

Cristina grows furious and grabs the poker from the run-down fake
chimney and starts beating him furiously.

Jack withstands the first blow, but the second blow to his head
makes him stagger.

Paul tries to get up but cannot. He starts. yelling at Cristina

\ | Son of! La bitch, | son of ‘pitch... fy

Paul, increasingly pale and weak, starts to breathe with great
difficulty as he watches how Cristina furiously beats Jack, who
falls on his knees.

   

PAUL (CONT'D)
No, Cristina, no..

Cristina seems ready to strike a mortal blow to his head. Paul
gasps for air: he asphyxiates. His face shows great pain. He looks
as if he is about to faint, to die.

| He tries to yell at Cristina, but no longer has the strength.

i Lying on the floor he sees how she grips the poker to kill Jack.
He grabs the gun, brings it to his chest with difficulty and
shoots.

He falls back from the impact, which enters above his heart and
blasts out his shoulder.

Cristina stops her attack and stares, stupefied, at Paul lying on
the floor. Sudden silence. She drops the poker and runs to him.
. She bends down and tries to rouse him.
j
oe, Jack sits up and stares at the scene, awestruck. Cristina turns
to him as in Sc.20.

 
 

CRISTINA -
(To Jack)
eS Call an ambulance.

 

Jack remains motionless, stunned.

CRISTINA (CONT'D)

bends down and looks at him.

bandaged) .

No cars pass. In the distance, he sees some vultures eating some
roadkill on the pavement.

He draws near and sees that they are devouring a dead jackrabbit.
He scares the vultures away and squats to look at it.
