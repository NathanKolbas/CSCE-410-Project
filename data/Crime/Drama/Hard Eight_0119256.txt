INT. SYDNEY'S '62 BUICK REGAL - MOVING - MORNING/LATER

Sydney is driving, John is in the backseat. Sydney gives a look in

the rearview mirror, locks eyes with John, who looks away.

JOBN
.+..you pull over a second?

EXT. SYDNEY'S CAR/HIGHWAY - MORNING - THAT MOMENT

of the back and into the front. The car pulls back out onto

the highway... -

INT. SYDNEY'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING/LATER

Sydney driving, John in the passenger seat. HOLD.
while in silence, then:

SYDNEY
My Uncle died in 1949.
He was a policeman in Boston.
My Uncle worked as a policeman in
Boston for thirteen years and he was
fired upon twenty three times in
the line of duty without being hit.
(beat)
One morning: He woke up, got dressed,
walked outside and down the street.
He went to buy his coffee and his
paper. He walked fifty yards from
his house...he was fifty yards from
reaching the store. He slipped
on a patch of ice, fell down and
cracked his forehead open on the
pavement.

BEAT.
SYDNEY

There are thirty-six possible
combinations of numbers on a pair
of dice. There's one way to roll a
two and six ways to roll a seven.
That's the math. That is what can be
proven. If you want to roll a four,
how can you do it? What are the
combinations?

JOHN

What number plus what number
equals four?

JOHN
Two plus two.

SYDNEY
What else?

JOHN
Three and one.

SYDNEY
What else?

JOHN

-.-That's it.

SYDNEY
One and three.

JOHN
I said that.

SYDNEY
There are three ways to make
a four, John. Two and two,three
and one, one and three. That's the
math. It's the only given in the
situation. Only thing is: we can't
control how they come up. In walking
down the street to buy a cup of coffee,
we relinquish the control to what?
Maybe, to who? I don't know. But it
doesn't matter to what or who or why,
because that's the way it is. We've
got nothing to do with any of it.
(beat)
All we can do is bet on it.

HOLD. They drive for a while in silence, then:

JOHN
No thanks.

SYDNEY
The lighter there doesn't work.

JOHN
I heard you. I just can't use matches.

Sydney lights the cig for himself with the matches. While he does,
John holds the wheel. Once the cig is lit, Sydney drives for a few
beats in silence, then:

SYDNEY
Are you going to smoke that?

JOHN
No.
 

SYDNEY
Why don't you use these matches?

JOHN
It's a rule with me. I just don't
use matches.

SYDNEY
Why not?

JOHN
I had a really bad experience once.
I promised I'd never use them again.

SYDNEY
Tell me.

JOHN
You know those monster book of
matches...those big daddy match books
with like forty matches?

SYDNEY
Yeah.

JOHN
I had one of those in my pocket once.
They just lit on fire, exploded in my pocket.

SYDNEY
The matches just went off?

JOHN
It's got something to do with friction
from what I understand...spontaneous
friction...and then WHAM. They went off.
I was standing in line for a movie,
all of a sudden....I swear to God,
the shock of it. It scared the shit
out of me. I had like third degree burns
on my leg...this close to. my dick...

SYDNEY
I was just thinking that.

JOHN
And a brand new pair of pants too.
I mean, the matches go off, burn the
hell out of my leg, scare the shit
out of me...but the real pisser was
blowing a hole in a brand new pair of jeans.

SYDNEY
That's terrible.
JOHN .
I thought about suing the matchbook
a . company...but...I understand that these
sorts of things happen. You know?
I mean, shit just happens. This happens,
that happens, you just deal with it.

SYDNEY
That's right. That's absolutely right, John.

HOLD. Sydney drags from his cig, then hands it to John.

SYDNEY
Here.

John takes the lit cig and uses it to light his own.

JOHN
Thanks,

John smokes his cig a moment, then:

JOHN

SYDNEY

JOHN
a You're a professional gambler.

SYDNEY
I play long enough and hard enough
“to get a comped room and put food in
my stomach.

JOHN
You've got it all figured out.

SYDNEY
John. I'm gonna loan you fifty dollars.
Now tell me: What'll you do with it?

JOHN
You asked me. I told you +-

SYDNEY
-- you could take it and play it.
Play it a certain way long enough
and hard enough to get a bed and a meal.
You won't win six thousand dollars,
I can assure you of that. And if you
think that you can: Well. You just can't.

SYDNEY
But if you don't --
CLEMENTINE
-- I'd get questioned and "Why were you
rude to so and so..." I can't talk back

to them. I can't tell them to fuck off

You're a good tipper, Captain.

Tell me something. Are you required
te flirt...to behave as you do towards
that table of men, maybe as some part
of your job?

CLEMENTINE
They don't say to do it.
SYDNEY
But if you don't --
CLEMENTINE
-- I'd get questioned and "Why were you
rude to so and so...” I can't talk back

to them. I can't tell them to fuck off
and leave me alone.

SYDNEY
As a rule --

CLEMENTINE
-- an unsaid rule. I'd also lose the tip.
SYDNEY
It seems an occupational hazard.

you pressed it for two.

SYDNEY
Did I hit it?

JIMMY
You didn't hit it, but it was
big balls bet and I remembered ~-

Jimmy laughs hard at his own joke, John joins. Sydney smiles
slightly, shoots a look at John, then places his reading glasses
in his pocket. i

SYDNEY '
It passes the time.

JOHN
Sydney and I saw a guy win $38,000
playing Keno once. He played
all day, sat in the same spot,
something like twelve hours...it
must have cost him about four grand
to win the thirty eight, but jesus...

JIMMY
I saw a guy the other night at
the El Dorado who fell down and had
a heart attack at the craps table.
Right in the middle of a hot shoot,
this guy gets all worked up,
he starts sweatin’ and shit,
all of a sudden the old motherfucker
just keels over...the joke of it
is the game kept goin'...people screamin,
"Place the four...get an ambulance...place

SYDNEY
It's not for my ears, but her's.
She can hear that sort of thing

JIMMY
I doubt if hearing she's got a
great pussy puts her in an
uncomfortable position ——

SYDNEY

from my table.

JIMMY
Well I don't know if you knew this,
but half the girls in this place

Just...y'know...I dunno --

JIMMY
Hey, I mean, I live up here.

It's a compliment to them. Believe me.

CLEMENTINE
I can't believe I just thought of this...
do you wanna hear a funny story? Oh my god --

JOHN
What?

CLEMENTINE
There was this guy and this girl,
I don't know them, my friend knew
the girl and she told me about this
story...oh my god...so this guy and
this girl -- they went to high school together.
And all through high school, they really
like each other but they were always
together with other people. But still,
on the side, they were always looking
at each other, smiling and kind of noticing
each other, but nothing ever happens.
So they graduate and they both go off
to different colleges and two years pass --
and it's summer vacation and they're both
back in town, back from school and they happen
to bump into each other on the street.
"Oh my God, Hi How Are You?" "What are you up to?"
"Nothing, what about you?" "Oh you know,
same old thing.” They're both thinking
about each other's boyfirend and girlfriend
from high school, rigt? So he asks her,
“Are you still going out with so and so...?"

CLEMENTINE (conta. )

She says, “No, we broke up..." She says
— to him, "Are you still going out with..."
He says, "No, it didn't work out, we broke up.”
So they're both like: cool, this could work out.
So they get together that night, they have
a date, they go and eat, they have a beautiful :
and great dinner....they're both a little nervous,
though. So outside the restaraunt, they have
their first kiss -- and it's beautiful and
sweet and perfect. So they look at each other
and he says, “Come stay with me, let's go back
to my apartment." They agree -- but then he
remembers he's got his roommate and all this
so it won't work out. She's staying with her
parents so that won't really work - but she tells
him she has this empty apartment that she's about
to move into but there's nothing in it --
no water, or heat, electricity,
just a matress -- well they finally
decide and say, "All we need is a matress,
let's go to the apatment."
So they go back...they have sex and it's
great...no first time jitters, nothing awkward,
it's just like....perfect, right?
Perfect sex and they're totally, totally in love.
Afterwards, they're in bed, they're naked
and holding each other in their arms and she
starts feeling his body, she feels his back
and she says, "You're so skinny, I never realized
you were so skinny." He says, "No I'm not..."
And he stands up -~ and he's showing
her his body, he says, "It's all muscle,
y'know, look:" So he turns his back to her :
and lifts his arms up like this -~ and he tightens
up, flexing his back muscles real hard and -- BOOM!
This projectial terd shoots right out of his
butt and lands SMACK on her neck....this poo
hits her right on the neck --
Now remember, they're in this apartment with
no towels, no water, nothing -- so they get up --
get dressed, they drive down to a gas station
and they have to hose her off -- they hose this
poo off her neck -- and then he drove her to her
parents house and that was it -- they never spoke
again -~ can you believe that?

I know John and I love him like
he was my own child, but I can tell
you this: I don't want to die.
I killed his father. I can tell you
what it was, but this is not an excuse.
I'm not begging for clemency.
All that matters: I don't wish to sacrifice my
life for John's well being, but I will
sacrifice this money for mine. Because
you have asked me...because after this I have
done all I can do for John: and for myself,
I will ask you, with all the sincerity
and heart that I have: Please don't put
a bullet in me and please don't tell John
what I have done. I trust that once I give
you this money you and I will have separate
paths and that this negotiation will settle
everything. That's what I hope.
I don't want to die.
