JAMES                                                                   This is my boys bedroom. BAYLISS                                                                   Mister James, are there any weapons                                                                   in the house? JAMES                                                                   This is how his room was three months                                                                   ago.  It hasnt been touched.          BAYLISS guidesJAMES to a wall, frisks him. JAMES (cont.)                                                                   Im not carrying a gun either. BAYLISS                                                                   Just making sure, thats all. JAMES                                                                   What, you dont trust me? PEMBLETON                                                                   You were at the Inner Harbor this                                                                   morning, werent you, Mister James?                                                                   And at the hospital this afternoon? JAMES                                                                   I was working.  Lemme tell you                                                                   something, awright?  My Tom, my Tommy,                                                                   hes got it all.  Smarts, looks,                                                                   girlfriends.  This is someone who                                                                   will make his mark.  Put his imprint                                                                   on the world.          BAYLISS releasesJAMES, sets him down in a chair.  A beat,          JAMES looksaround the Room. JAMES (cont.)                                                                   He

PEMBLETON                                                                   Where is Missus James? JAMES                                                                   Who knows?  She left a coupla weeks                                                                   ago.  Didnt say for where.  Id                                                                   guess her sisters in Buffalo, but I                                                                   havent called, she hasnt either.                                                                   Dont have the energy.  Yeah, I shot                                                                   that man this morning.  Giardello. BAYLISS                                                                   Mister James, I have to advise you                                                                   of your rights -- JAMES                                                                   My what?  Rights? --                                                                           (smiles, looks away)                                                                   I have a right to have things as                                                                   they were three months ago.  Id                                                                   always played by the rules.  Cut my                                                                   lawn, paid my taxes, didnt honk at                                                                   anyone coming out of the church                                                                   parking lot.  What else was I supposed                                                                   to do?  I dont deserve my Tommy                                                                   dying.  That is my right. BAYLISS                                                                   Your son is dead? JAMES                                                                   Yes. BAYLISS                                                                   Im sorry. JAMES                                                                   What for?  You didnt know him BAYLISS                                                                   No one should have a child die. JAMES                                                                   Tell that to all them bigshots who                                                                   want to legalize drugs.  Who want                                                                   everyone to have the right to get                                                                   themselves high on anything they                                                                   want. PEMBLETON                                                                   Youve admitted shooting Al Giardello. JAMES                                                                   I shot him, yeah.  I was aiming for                                                                   Schmoke, too, but, hey, why should I                                                                   expect to be a sharpshooter, huh?                                                                   Why should I expect my boy to go                                                                   into Baltimore, buy himself his dope                                                                   and O.D. right on the street?  Why                                                                   should I expect his friends who I                                                                   know were with him, why do they leave                                                                   him on the street, right there at                                                                   Broadway and Fleet and let him die?                                                                   Three months ago almost to the day.                                                                   And this is how Tommy leaves his                                                                   room.  If hedve just cleaned the                                                                   damn place up, I couldve sold our                                                                   home.  But, naw, hes gotta leave it                                                                   like this.  His personal touches.                                                                   How can I sell this house that his                                                                   mother cannot stand to live in                                                                   anymore?  I shot the dealer who sold                                                                   Tommy the drugs.  And that man,                                                                   Giardello, because he wants to                                                                   legalize drugs.  Im trying to stop                                                                   that.  Ill shot whoever says its                                                                   okay.  Cause its not.  Im trying                                                                   to save these innocent kids.  Thats                                                                   all. BAYLISS                                                                   I understand.          JAMES and BAYLISSexchange a look.  BAYLISS stands JAMES up,          reflexivelyreaches for his cuffs, turns to PEMBLETON. BAYLISS (cont.)                                                                   I dont have any cuffs on me. JAMES                                                                   You dont need em.          BAYLISS and PEMBLETONlead JAMES out of the Room, into:A97    INT.

sympathy for James?                                                                   What hes going through? PEMBLETON                                                                   Hes laying the blame off on Gee                                                                   cause in his heart of hearts, he                                                                   knows hes responsible for what                                                                   happened to his kid. BAYLISS                                                                   I appreciate how he feels. PEMBLETON                                                                   You can appreciate all the hell you                                                                   want, Tim, but theres a line.                                                                   Between right and wrong. BAYLISS                                                                   Youre the expert on that.  Nothing                                                                   lumpy about you, cause you know                                                                   all. PEMBLETON                                                                   The city looks good

wine and dine her at Pierpoint.                                                                   Romantic.  Of course the line is                                                                   clear.  Theres good, theres evil.                                                                   Dont be one of these

expert.          PEMBLETON turns,sees that BAYLISS stopped. PEMBLETON                                                                   It doesnt take an expert to

BAYLISS                                                                   Time for one last confession, Frank... PEMBLETON                                                                   Confession? BAYLISS                                                                   I killed a man.

PEMBLETON                                                                   Huh? BAYLISS                                                                   I shot the bastard dead. PEMBLETON                                                                   Good.  Go to jail.  Lethal injection                                                                   or the gas chamber? BAYLISS                                                                   Im not kidding.  I killed him. PEMBLETON                                                                   You couldnt kill anyone. BAYLISS                                                                   He got off on a technicality.                                                                   Sonofabitch had to die before he                                                                   murdered another

Ryland. PEMBLETON                                                                   Internal cleared you? BAYLISS                                                                   Frank, Im saying I went to hunt                                                                   this bastard down.  I found him and                                                                   blew his brains out.  I executed him                                                                   in cold blood. PEMBLETON                                                                   And Im saying, Internal rules it                                                                   was a good shooting. BAYLISS                                                                   Internal doesnt know crap about me                                                                   killing Ryland. PEMBLETON                                                                   Youre standing here and youre                                                                   telling me you killed someone. BAYLISS                                                                   Yes. PEMBLETON                                                                   In self-defense. BAYLISS                                                                   No. PEMBLETON                                                                   You were standing there with your                                                                   gun and then it went off and you                                                                   dont remember how. BAYLISS                                                                   Frank -- PEMBLETON                                                                   Cause guns go off accidentally.                                                                   Happens all the time. BAYLISS                                                                   This was no accident. PEMBLETON                                                                   Im saying its an accident.  For                                                                   you to shoot someone, it has to be a                                                                   mistake. BAYLISS                                                                   No mistake, no accident. PEMBLETON                                                                   Tim -- BAYLISS                                                                   Youre a good cop. PEMBLETON                                                                   Im not a cop anymore. BAYLISS                                                                   Youll always be a cop. PEMBLETON                                                                   Im a teacher now.  A civilian. BAYLISS                                                                   I murdered this guy, cause he was a                                                                   predator.  He preyed on women. PEMBLETON                                                                   Why are you doing this? BAYLISS                                                                   I put the gun right up to the mothers                                                                   brain and I pulled the trigger. PEMBLETON                                                                   Shut up. Just -- shut up. BAYLISS                                                                   What do I do, Frank? PEMBLETON                                                                   You put this on me?  You sunofabitch. BAYLISS                                                                   You have a conscience.  I have one.                                                                   I dont know why mine keeps kicking                                                                   me, but it does.  All the time.                                                                           (taps his chest, open-                                                                            palmed)                                                                   Here  Im okay with it.  In my heart,                                                                   I know I saved some girls life.                                                                   Some girl in New Orleans.  Who will                                                                   never know.  Thats where Ryland was                                                                   headed.  He said the girls were easy                                                                   there.  Hed have access --                                                                           (taps his temple)                                                                   But here?          Pause. PEMBLETON and BAYLISS exchange a look. PEMBLETON                                                                   I come back for this. BAYLISS                                                                   Maybe its cause this James guy                                                                   hes going to jail for basically the                                                                   same reasons I had for doing what I                                                                   did.  And Im out here.  Free. PEMBLETON                                                                   You wait til Im back and then you                                                                   have to unload, huh?  Unburden                                                                   yourself... Whats supposed to happen                                                                   now? BAYLISS                                                                   You tell me. PEMBLETON                                                                   Im not bringing you in. BAYLISS                                                                   No, huh? PEMBLETON                                                                   Im not a cop.  Im not official. BAYLISS                                                                   So youll what, not tell anyone?                                                                   Keep my secret to yourself? PEMBLETON                                                                   Sunofabitch.  Youre a sunofabitch.                                                                   You murdered him. BAYLISS                                                                   Yes. PEMBLETON                                                                   Whos the primary? BAYLISS                                                                   Lewis. PEMBLETON                                                                   You talk to him? BAYLISS                                                                   Youre the first to know.  Who else                                                                   was I going to tell? PEMBLETON                                                                   But did you talk to Lewis? BAYLISS                                                                   About the case?  No. PEMBLETON                                                                   No one suspects it was you. BAYLISS                                                                   Cmon, me?  Whod suspect me?  Good                                                                   old Tim Bayliss.  The Zen Detective. PEMBLETON                                                                   Hunh. BAYLISS                                                                   So youll take me in. PEMBLETON                                                                   Im going to take you in?  Are you wild? BAYLISS                                                                   Youll take me in. PEMBLETON                                                                   No. BAYLISS                                                                   Did I take a bullet for you once? PEMBLETON                                                                   Cut it out. BAYLISS                                                                   Did I? PEMBLETON                                                                   Im not taking you in. BAYLISS                                                                   I take one for you, you take one for                                                                   me.  Thats square business. PEMBLETON                                                                   This is not taking a bullet for you.                                                                   This is you wanting me to toss your                                                                   ass into a jackpot.  Youre confessing                                                                   to a murder, Tim.  You understand                                                                   that? BAYLISS                                                                   You want someone else to bring me                                                                   in.  Someone else should bust me. PEMBLETON                                                                   No. BAYLISS                                                                   Then it has to be you. PEMBLETON                                                                   No. BAYLISS                                                                   I thought about eating my gun.  I                                                                   figured if I didnt tell you and you                                                                   didnt do what is right --                                                                           (taps temple)                                                                   -- for here -- then theres only one                                                                   other way out. PEMBLETON                                                                   Tim, cops in prison -- not a pretty                                                                   sight. BAYLISS                                                                   I respect you, Frank, I love... you...          PEMBLETON andBAYLISS look off, then back at each other. PEMBLETON                                                                   You thought about putting a gun to                                                                   yourself? BAYLISS                                                                   Youd be saving my life.  I dont                                                                   know for how long, but for now, at                                                                   least, you would. PEMBLETON                                                                   I believe that you didnt mean to do                                                                   this killing. BAYLISS                                                                   If thats what you want to believe. PEMBLETON                                                                   Do you want to go back inside now? BAYLISS                                                                   Never delay whats inevitable, right?                                                                   It has to be what it has to be. PEMBLETON                                                                   Sonofabitch. BAYLISS                                                                   Frank, do you absolve me? PEMBLETON                                                                   Absolve you?  I cant. BAYLISS                                                                   Cant  You mean you wont. PEMBLETON                                                                   I cant.  Can not.  Its not within                                                                   my power...          BAYLISS takeshis badge out of his pocket, hands it to          PEMBLETON. PEMBLETON looks at it a moment, puts it in his          pocket, looksout at the sky. PEMBLETON (cont.)                                                                   I think maybe Mary and I should stay                                                                   home tonight and have dinner with                                                                   the

Lieutenant.  Pre-ordained                                                                   or anything. FELTON                                                                   Take you, for example.  If youd                                                                   just slept five minutes longer this                                                                   morning, you woulda run into this                                                                   fender bender on Light Street on                                                                   your way to the Inner Harbor -- CROSETTI                                                                   Which wouldve made you a half hour                                                                   late for your speech -- FELTON                                                                   And the guy who shot you woulda got                                                                   nervous and left -- CROSETTI                                                                   Probably shot somebody else -- FELTON                                                                   And we wouldnt now be having the                                                                   pleasure of your company. GIARDELLO                                                                   I suddenly got worried that -- My                                                                   son, hes a cop.  I thought, maybe -- CROSETTI                                                                   I wouldnt worry.  Life is short,                                                                   but once youre dead, youre a long                                                                   time dead, if you know what I mean. FELTON                                                                   Your son -- ? GIARDELLO                                                                   Michael.

wait and see.  See what                                                                   hand hes dealt -- GIARDELLO                                                                   And how he plays it. FELTON                                                                   The best thing about this place?                                                                   All those cares and worries you had                                                                   in life?  They dont matter anymore.                                                                   Rest in peace, means what it says. CROSETTI                                                                   You want some coffee? GIARDELLO                                                                   Coffee?  Coffee would be good.  You                                                                   got espresso? CROSETTI                                                                   Espresso?  Where do you think you                                                                   are?
