Bet loose by the opium, NOODLES’

& little dlack coffin, floating in
the air, comes forward through the
darkness, lighted only by four flick=
ering flames. SGuddenly a spotlight
atrikes it, and we see that it rests
om & bed of flowers borne on tha
shoulders of two waiters. It's a
eaka, & chocolate cake, with a rib- -
bon of spun sugar that reads -
“FROHIBITION." And sugar champagne
bottles at the cornera of ths

eoffin serve as candlesticks.

We're at Fat Moe's, one of a mgl~

picks out the glitter and the gleam,
aa do the little Tiffany lamps on
each teble.

The boys in the band leave their
platform to lead the procession with
a funeral march is the Arestrong
manner. Two young blades, PATSY and
COCKEETE (We recognize them from
their pictures in the paper aa the

leu ady (PEGGY) and several | —
other gaudy chicks, all carrying on
like the nearest and dearest of tha

NOODLES turns the smalier ef the
two keys in the metal door of a

He's in a peeling passageway that
‘leads to the subway platform. He
opens the locker door and takes
dat @ heat-up straw suitcase.

Holding it against his chest, he
unsDaps the catch and opens the
suitcase just a crack, just enough
to look inside.

His eyos widen with alarm at what
Ne sees. He opens the suitcase
all the way and gropes through the
Contents with one spastic hand.

There's nothing in it but crumpled
paper and old tabloids.

He moves in 2 daze to a rubbish

He moves towards then.

His PALS shove @ push-cart

NOODLES has a moment of hope, as
he sees WHITEY, the cop, peering

BUGSY calls off bis dogs. He

Side of the garbage truck, but
at's 1968 again. The truck is
a later model, with shinier,
more menacing teeth, It's
parked and abandoned by the

" gates of a fancy Long Island

mangion.

HOODLES cautiously ups to the
gates and peers through. He
sees @ car sppreachings down
the twisting drive. It's the
#ame limousines with the smoky
windows that he aaw et the
semetery.

As it passes through the gates,
he compares the license plate
umber with the one he jotted
down earlier; it's the same.

He watches the car drive off.

It doean't get far. A few
hundred yards down the street,
and the car explodes with an

BLAST.

chaise longue in a well-kept
garden. She looks up and
sighs. Her hair ia white

now, her face lined. An open

book lies forgotten in her
lap. She stares off into
space for a moment, and then
says,

Standing beside her chair,
NOODLES follows her Sitter
gaze, and sees other elderly
olks, sitting om denches
under the trees or strolling
slowly with canes or nurses.

She looks around her.

NOODLES takes a lawn chair
and Sits dbaside her.

She seems startled by the
question, Then she nods
towards the others, all with
their noses in papers or
books, and says quietly,

CAROL

I kept wishing I'd see you
again some day, Nocdles.

I never thought I'd end up
here.

I got ay husband's pension
to live on. You remexber
him, my husband? He's the

NOODLES

That's the nov only funny

He doesn't say anything. She
pauses, then says,

Another slow shake of the head.

CAROL gets wearily up from the
chaise. NOODLES gets up too
and gives her a hand, They
move Slowly towards the porch

Some of the old folks are still

eating. The dismal silence is

broken only by the sound of

As they cross the reom, CAROL
Glances back at NCODLES with the
old antagonism in her eyes.

GaROL

But, aa. they pass into the

ROODLES stops.

A photograph on the wall has
caught his eye. It shows the
innaugtral festivities of the
home - a group of elderly in-
mates gathered behind a ban-
quet teble full of dignitaries,
doctors, and nutses, 411 with
champagne glasses in their
bands? And in the center of

He points to DEBORAE.

NOODLES steps towards it.

NOODLES (Cont.)

Then, without noticing it,
I atarted to forget her.
And when I remembered, it
gust made me realize I'd

out her.

CAROL

NOODLES
You don't know her?

CAROL

She catches sight of a NURSE
in the hallway, and she be-
eomes almost maniacally intense
as she leans towards NOODLES.

NOODLES doesn't take his eyes
or his mind from the photograph
aa he takes out bis wallet and
Randa her a fifty dollar bill.

She goes to the NURSE, mutters
something to her, and passes
her the money. Then she starts
up the stairs, moving quickly
uow, forgetting NCODLES com-
pletely. .

He remains in front of the

armed policamen come out and
eatation themselves at each
side of the entrance.

A truck pulls up and stops in
front of the steps, a small
truck bearing the name of an
industrial cleaning establish-
ment. MAX and NOODLES get
out. They're wearing work
clothas and act as cool as a
couple of cukes.

They sling their equipment
around their necks, take 4
pucket in each hanc, and
start up the steps.

They enter the bank by a door

banking room. It's half an
hour to opening time; the clerks

‘gnd tellers are busy with their

Hittle tasks; a couple of clean-
dng women are polishing the
woodwork and sweeping up.

MAY and NOODIES put their ceases

down, and while they get out

their rags and brushes and ah «:
ammonia, they look casually .
avouml. Anyone in the trade can

-tell they're casing the joint.

Policemen are already on duty at
strategic points sround the room.
Glancing up at the two balconies
that circle the rooa, NOODLES sees
more boys in tinue, armed and ready
for business,

“MAX and NCODLES exchanges a compli-

oitous glance. MAX will check out

TES will take the upper floors.
They nove swiftly ane efficiently,
as they've deen cleaning spis-

dis all it takes - ona to empty the
used sawdust into one bucket, one

_ to swipe a little ammonia around

wind-up toys. And they cover the
whole territory, corridors, offices,

warren of the building. and every-
where they go there are cops, cops
who take their joos seriously.

MAX doesn't miss the trolleys that
deliver hefty packets of bilis ta
the tellers, so_ba stashed neatly
in drawers and locked away.

NOODIES, on the other hand, has
his ees on the cops who are

ng the plece. It's pretty
glear what each of the boys is
thinking about the attractions of
this particular locale for an
eventual heist.

NOODLES strays from his spittoons
eng enough to get a general view
of the hall from one of the bal-
conies, but he's quickly warned
off by the wava of a gun barrel.
The cops are obviously more than
just decoration.

NOODIES joins MAX downstaira to

The SENATOR - MAX - standa at a
window in an upper floor of his
house on Long Island. Perhaps

muddy vhe image, but he looks old
and tired, much pore cuanged over
the years than Nocdies. His eyes
are bright and anxious as he scans
the spacious grounds of the house.

Lanterns and flares light the aoe
@laborate gardens, the walks and
Poadways, and the path that leads
down to the wharf and the sound.

A party is going on in vais spac-
tacular setting; tre srounds are
full of people, and mora are arri-
ving: handsome women in smart
gowns, genta in tuxes, milicary
officers in full dress. The Es-
tablishment s'amuse; cordiel hand-
shakes, formal hand-kissing, slaps
on the shoulder, a¢rsetings ecress
the crowd. Waiters circulate with
drinks and food; buffet tables are
scattered lavishly across the lawns.
And Ridden speakavs bring the nusic
played indoors by the orchestra out
to the party-goers.

. SOFT MUSIC
fhe elegance, the sophistication;.
and the luxury are.ail real; for
once, all that glitcvers is gold.
And the guests circulate through
the gardens and tne pavillions,
around the pool and down to the
aea, with the conscious aatisfac-
tion of the very very rich.

MAX sees DEBORAH in the crowd, dazz-
ling as ever, surrounded by admirers.
DAVID is there too, with a gang of
young friends,

Suddeoly, MAX pulls back from the

MAX comes away from the window
and ¢rosses the huge, dark room,
The walls are panelled in oak;
the iided bindings of the com-

. plete works of everyone gleam

om the bookcases; the windows
are shrouded in heavy velour;
the rug is a Chinese masterplece;
and a Lautrec hangs over the
mantle.

MAX passes an arnchair where
another old friend sits -
JIMMY O'DONNELL, the former
knight in shining armor, now
in evening clothes and carry-
ing a cane instead of & lance.

MAX goes to his desk, a slab

of satiny walnut beside which

Another screen shows the gateg

glimpses of the interior of

where guests mingle and chat.

JIMMY watches for a mouent,

JIMMY
I've got to admit that this

party was a good idea, Sena~

MAX sits at the desk as JIMMY

It's like saying, I may be

JIMMY havis himself up and
limps over to the bar for

‘a drink. He rejects the in-

sinuation.

Ze nods towards the screens.

JEMMY goes back to his chair.
He picks up a briefcase fron
the floor beside it.

Ee puts the case on the desk
and takes out papers and docu-
meats, and a couple of “ledgers.

Especially if the house blows
up. Where are you putting
the next bomo? In the freez-

 IIMer

You're out of your mind. You
can't even think straight

any more. There's a waiting
list of people who'd like ta
send flowers to your funeral.

I could point out ten of then
right now, if you want me to.
MAX

Fine.But: nobody wants to rear
my obituary in froat of the
commission as much as you de,
you and the union.

JIMMI

We just want to get out of
this clean and legal.

MAX

I've heard these lyrics be~
fore..

JIMMY

There are still a few develop-
ments that need te be seen to.

Everything's as we agreed.
I had my lawyers draw it up.
All you have to do is sign.
MAX glances over the papers.

MAX flips through the papers.

JIMMY sa7s nothings his face
is a blank.

the ledgers.

SIMMY keeps cool.

. MAX (Ironically)
My last wishes, huh?

JIMMY (Staring)

I don't think you're ina
position to express any wishes.

MAX
Everything goes, eh?

JIMMY

Twelve per cent ia put aside
for your son. We're not in-
erates. You don's have to
worry about hin,

MAX
Unless I don’t siga, Suh?

In twenty-five years, I've
helped you make a forvune,
you and the rest of the ass-
holes.

JIMMY

It was a reasonable arrange-
ment detween labor and manage-
ment.

MAX

Two par cent for them and
forty for you. You defend
them and you screw then. I¢'s
been the story of your life.

MAX grabs JIMMY by his lapels,
ready to hit him.

TIMMY doesn't react. He gives
MAX an icy look and says,

 

MAX catches sight of NCODLES
in the screen that shows the
gate, showing his invitation
to one of the servants.

MAX lets go of JIMMY end

You're stupid, and, unfor-

JIMMY

Why don't you take care of

His tone and expression change.
He sits at the other end of

NOODLES looks at him and sgys
nothing.

MAX takes a gun from his poc-

He glides the gun towards
