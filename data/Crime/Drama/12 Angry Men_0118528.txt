“The notes on characters are extremely brief, since it is

felt that what they are and who they are will be revealed
in their dialogue and actions ruing the course of the
film.

35 years old. Assistant high school football coach. A
small,petty man who is at first wary of, and then
impressed with the authority he has. Handles himself quite
formally. Not overly bright, but dogged.

38 years old. Bank clerk. A meek, hesitant man who finds
it difficult to maintain any opinions of his own. Easily
swayed and usually adopts the opinion of the last person
to whom he has spoken.

40 years old. Head of a messenger service. A very
strong, very forceful, extremely opinionated man within
whom can be detected a streak of sadism. A humorless man
who is intolerant of opinions other than his own, and
accustomed to forcing his wishes and views upon others.

50 YEARS OLD. Stockbroker. A man of wealth and position.
A practiced speaker who presents himself well at all
times.. Seems to feel a little bit above the rest of the
jurors. His only concern is with the facts in this case
and he is appalled with the behavior of the others.
Constantly preening himself, combing his hair, cleaning
his nails, etc.

25 years old. Mechanic. A naive, very rightened young man
who takes his obligations in this case very seriously but
who finds it difficult to speak up when his elders have
the floor.

33 years old. Housepainter. An honest, but dull-witted
man who comes upon his decisions slowly and carefully. A
man who finds it difficult to create positive opinions,
but who must listen to and digest and accept these
opinions offered by others which appeal to him most.

42 years'old. Salesman. A loud, flashy, glad-handed
salesman type who has more important things to do than sit
on a jury. He is quick to show temper, quick to form
opinions on things about which he knows nothing. He is a
bully, and, of course, a coward.

JUROR #12:

THE JUDGE

42 years old. Architect. A quiet, thoughtful, gentle
man. A man who sees many sides to every question and
constantly seeks the truth. A man of strength tempered
with compassion. Above all a man who wants justice to be
done, and will fight to see that it is.

70 years old. Retired. A mild, gentle old man, long
since defeated by life, and now merely waiting to die. A
man who recognizes himself for what he is, and mourns the
days when it would have been possible to be courageous
without shielding himself behind his many years. From the
way he takes pills whenever he is excited, it is obvious
that he has a heart condition.

46 years old. Garage owner. An angry, bitter man. A
man who antagonizes almost at sight. A bigot who places
no values on any human life save his own. A man who has
been nowhere and is going nowhere and knows it deep within
him. He has a bad cold and continually blows his nose,
sniffs a Benzedrine inhaler, etc.

48 years old. Watchmaker. A refugee from Europe who has
come to this country in 1941. A man who speaks with an
accent and who is ashamed, jumble, almost subservient to
the people around him, but a man who will honestly seek
justice because he has suffered through so much injustice.

30 years old. Advertising man. A slick, bright
advertising man who thinks of human beings in terms of
percentages, graphs and polls, and has no real
understanding of people. A superficial snob, but trying
to be a good fellow. Throughout the film he doodles on a
scratch pad.

the comings and goings of a number of ordinary people on an
ordinary day. Camera holds on steps and building front from the
distance and then dollies in slowly.

INT. THE LOBBY - SAME

Seething with activity, people of all kinds walking swiftly,
purposefully to and from elevators, newsstands, etc. Others
standing, waiting. Guards stationed at various posts. Camera pans
across lobby and then dollies into a bank of elevators. A number
of people crowd into one. The door closes.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS - SAME

The elevators on left. Many doorways to various courtrooms on
right. Each door marked with a hanging sign. The first sign reads
“Court of General Sessions. Part I”. The second sign reads “Court
of General Sessions. Part II” etc. An elevator door opens and a
number of people exit and walk down the corridor. Other people,
men and women, stand in the corridor talking. The whole feeling is
one of movement, activity, intense concentration. Everyone has a
purpose. -Camera dollies down the corridor, following a group of
people who exited from the elevator. People peel off from the
group at various doors. At each door stands a guard. People move
in and out of the doors. Camera reaches the door marked “Part VI”,
and pans around to face the door. A guard stands in front of it,
impassively. No one else is in front of the door, as compared to
the knots of whispering people in front of all the other doors.

The case going on in “Part VI” obviously has very little general
interest. ‘Through the glass window of the door we can see, far in
the background, the judge at his bench. He is facing to his left,
and talking. We hear nothing. He stops and turns to his right.

He raises his hand as if calling the waiter.

JUDGE
..-and that concludes the court's
explanation of the legal aspects of
this case. And now, gentlemen of the
jury, I come to my final instruction
to you. Murder in the first degree -
- premeditated homicide -- is the
most serious charge tried in our
criminal courts. You've listened to
the testimony and you've had the law
read to you and interpreted as it
applies to this case. It now becomes
your duty to try and separate the
facts from the fancy. One man is
dead. The life of another is at
stake. I urge you to deliberate
honestly and thoughtfully. If there

is a reasonable doubt -- then you
must bring me a verdict of "not
guilty". If, however, there is no

reasonable doubt, then you must, in
good conscience, find the accused
guilty. However you decide, your
verdict must be unanimous. In the
event you find the accused guilty...

ACCUSED
Rican man vulnerable and afraid.

_. JUDGE (CONT)
...the bench will not entertain a
recommendation for mercy. The death
sentence is mandatory in this case.
I don't envy you your job. You are
faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

There is a brief pause. The jurors file out.
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96 3

INT. JURY ROOM - DAY

A very hot summer afternoon. It is a large, drab, bare room in
need of painting, with three windows in the back wall through which
can be seen the New York skyline. Off the jury room is a washroom,
with a lavatory beyond. A large, scarred table is C with twelve
chairs around it. A bench stands against the wall and there are
several extra chairs and a small table in the room, plus a water-
cooler, with paper cups and a waste basket and an electric fan over
the bench and a clock over the cooler and row of hooks for coats,
with a shelf over it. There are pencils, pads and ashtrays on the
table. At night the room is lit by fluorescent lighting with the
switch next to the door.

The Jurors enter preceded by a Guard. He checks his list. The 9th
Juror, an old man, crosses, goes into the washroom, and exits to
the lavatory. The 4th Juror begins to read a newspaper. Several
jurors open the windows. Others move awkwardly about the room.
There is no conversation for a few moments. The 3rd Juror takes
out some notes and studies them. The 2nd Juror crosses to the
water-cooler, gets a cup of water. The Foreman tears a sheet from
the notepad and tears up little slips of paper for ballots. The
Guard crosses to the 12th Juror and checks his name. The 7th Juror
crosses to the 4th Juror and offers him a stick of gum. The 4th
Juror shakes his head.

7TH JUROR
(turning to the 8th Juror)
Do you want some gum?

8TH JUROR
(smiling)
No thanks.

The 7th Juror vigorously chews a piece of gum himself and crosses
to the 6th Juror.

7TH JUROR
(mopping his brow)
y'know something? I phoned up for
the weather. This is the hottest day
of the year.

7TH JUROR (CONT)
(the 6th Juror nods and gazes out
the window)
You'd think they'd at least air
condition the place. I almost
dropped dead in court.

GUARD
Okay, gentlemen. Everybody's here.
If there's anything you want, I'm
right outside. Just knock.
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96 4

The Guard exits and in the silence the sound is heard of the door
being locked.

5TH JUROR
I never knew they locked the door.
10TH JUROR
Sure they lock the door. What'd you
think?
5TH JUROR
I don't know. It just never occurred
to me.

The 10th Juror crosses and pauses beside the Foreman and indicates
the. slips of paper.

10TH JUROR
Hey, what's that for?

FOREMAN
Well, I figured we might want to vote
by ballots.

10TH JUROR

Great idea! Maybe we can get him
elected senator.

He laughs until he begins to cough.

The Foreman looks at his watch and compares it with the clock. The
3rd Juror takes a cup of water from the water-cooler, moves to the
2nd Juror and looks around the room as he sips the water.

3RD JUROR
(to the 2nd Juror)
How'd you like it?

2ND JUROR
. (mildly)
I don't know, it was pretty
interesting.

3RD JUROR
Yeah? I was falling asleep.

2ND JUROR
I mean, I've never been on a jury
before.
oe —

FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

 

3RD JUROR
Really? I've sat on juries, and it
always amazes me the way these
lawyers can talk, and talk and talk,
even when the case is as obvious as
this one. I mean, did you ever hear
so much talk about nothing?

2ND JUROR
Well, I guess they're entitled.

3RD JUROR
Sure they are. Everybody deserves a
fair trial. That's the system.
Listen, I'm the last one to say
anything against it, but I'm telling
you sometimes I think we'd be better
off if we took these tough kids. and
slapped 'em down before they make
trouble, you know? Save us a lot of
time and money.

The 2nd Juror looks nervously at the 3rd Juror, nods, rises, moves
to the water-cooler, refills his cup and stands alone, sipping.

7TH JUROR
(to the Foreman)
Hey, how about getting started here?

3RD JUROR
Yeah, let's get this over with.
We've probably all got things todo.

FOREMAN
Well, I was figuring we'd take a
five-minute break. I mean, one man's
in the bathroom...

5TH JUROR
(to the Foreman, hesitantly)
Are we going to sit in order?

FOREMAN .
What? I don't know. I suppose so.

The 8th Juror is looking out the window.

12TH JUROR
(to the 8th Juror)
Not a bad view.
(the 8th Juror nods)
What d'you think of the case?
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96 6

12TH JUROR (CONT)

(the 8th Juror doesn't answer)
It had a-lot of interest for me. No
dead spots -- know what I mean? I['11
tell you we were lucky to get a
murder case. I figured us for a
burglary or an assault or something.
Those can be the dullest.

(he looks out of the window)
Say, isn't that the Woolworth
Building?

8TH JUROR
That's right.

12TH JUROR
Funny, I've lived here all my life
and I've never been in it.

The 8th Juror gazes ‘out of the window. The 12th Juror looks at him ~
for a moment then moves away. The 7th Juror, talking with the 10th
Juror, laughs)

. 10TH JUROR
Yeah, can you imagine, sitting there
for three days just for this?

7TH JUROR
And what about that business with the
knife? I mean, asking grown-up
people to believe that kind of
bullshit.

10TH JUROR
Well, look, you've gotta expect that.
You know what you're dealing with.

7TH JUROR
Yeah, I suppose so.
. (the 10th Juror blows his nose
vigorously)
What's the matter, you got a cold?

10TH JUROR
And how. These hot weather colds can
kill you. I can hardly touch my
nose. Know what I mean?
(he blows his nose loudly)

7TH JUROR :

Well, your horn's all right. Now try

(the 7th Juror climbs on to the

bench and tries the fan)
Oh, that's beautiful, the fan doesn't
work.

(he steps down)
Somebody take a letter to.the mayor.
"Dear Stingy..."

The 3rd Juror moves about the 4th Juror, leans over and scans the
4th Juror's newspaper. The Foreman climbs on the bench and
examines the fan)

3RD JUROR
(to the 4th Juror)
I didn't get a chance to look at the
newspapers today. Anything new going

on?

4TH JUROR
I was just wondering how the market
closed.

3RD JUROR

I wouldn't know. Say, are you on the
Exchange or something?

4TH JUROR
I'm a broker.

3RD JUROR
Really? I run a messenger service.
"The Beck and Call Company." The
name's by wife's idea. I employ
thirty-seven people... started with
nothing...

7TH JUROR
(looking at his watch)
Hey, Mr. Foreman, let's go. What

d'you say?

FOREMAN
All right, gentlemen. Let's take
seats.

(to the 2nd Juror)
This better be fast. I got tickets
to a ball game tonight. Yankees --
Cleveland. We got this new kid
pitching, Modjelewski, or whatever
his name is. He's a bull, this kid.
(He shoots his hand forward and
out to indicate the path of a
curve ball)
Shhooooooom. A real jug handle.
(no reaction at all from the 2nd
Juror)
You're quite a ball fan, aren't you?
(He turns to the Foreman)
Where do you want us to sit?

FOREMAN
Well, I was thinking we ought to sit
in order, by jury numbers.
(he points with each number)
Two, three, four, and so on, if
that's okay with you gentlemen.

10TH. JUROR
What's the difference?

4TH JUROR
I think it's reasonable to sit
according to number.

10TH JUROR
(rising)
Let it be.

He moves and sits on chair 10.

The Jurors begin to take their seats. The 8th Juror continues to
star out of the window. The 9th Juror is still in the lavatory.

12 JUROR
(to the 11th Juror)
What was your impression of the
prosecuting attorney?

11TH JUROR
(with a German accent)
I beg pardon?

12TH JUROR
I thought he was really sharp. I
mean, the way he hammered home his
points, one by one, in logical
sequence.

It takes a good brain to do that. I

11TH JUROR
Yes, I think he did an expert job.

: 12TH JUROR
I mean, he had a lot of drive, too.
Real drive.

7TH JUROR
Okay, let's get this show on the
road.

FOREMAN

(to the 8th Juror)
How about sitting down?
(the 8th Juror does not hear the
Foreman)
The gentleman at the window.
(The 8th Juror turns, startled)
How about sitting down?

8TH JUROR
Oh, I'm sorry.

He moves his chair and sits.

The 9th Juror enters the washroom from the lavatory and washes his

hands.

10TH JUROR
(across the table to the 4th
Juror)
It's pretty tough to figure, isn't
it? A kid kills his father. Bing!
Just like that.

12TH JUROR
Well, if you analyze the figures...

10TH JUROR
What figures, it’s those people. I'm
tellin' you they let the kids run
wild up there. Well, maybe it serves
‘em right. Know what I mean?

Is everybody here?

The 6th Juror rises and moves to the washroom door.

7TH JUROR
(to the 5th Juror)
Hey, you a Yankee fan?

5TH JUROR
No. Milwaukee.

7TH JUROR

Milwaukee! That's like being hit on
the head with a crowbar once a day.
Listen, who they got...

(the 6th Juror knocks on the

washroom door)
...I'm asking you, who they got
besides great grounds-keepers?

The 9th Juror enters from the washroom.
FOREMAN

(to the 7th Juror)
We'd like to get started

9TH JUROR
I'm sorry.
(he crosses to his seat)
7TH JUROR
Milwaukee!
9TH JUROR

I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

FOREMAN

All right. Now you gentlemen can
handle this any way you want to. I
mean, I'm not going to have any
rules. If we want to discuss it
first and then vote, that's one way.
Or we can vote right now to see how
we stand.

(he pauses and looks around)
Well, that's all I have to say.
slowly.

FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

4TH JUROR
I think it's customary to take a
preliminary vote.

7TH JUROR
Yeah, let's vote. Who knows, maybe
we can all go home.

FOREMAN
It's up to you. Just let's remember
we've got a first degree murder
charge here. If we vote "guilty" we
send the accused to the electric
chair. That's mandatory.

4TH JUROR
I think we all know that.

3RD JUROR
Come on, let's vote.

10TH JUROR
Yeah, let's see who's where.

FOREMAN

Anybody doesn't want to vote?

(he looks around, the others are

silent)
All right. This has to be a twelve-
to-nothing vote either way. That's
the law. Okay, are we ready? All
those voting "guilty" raise your
hands.

Seven or eight hands go up immediately. Several others go up more
Everyone looks around the table as the Foreman rises and

begins to count hands. The 9th Juror's hand goes up now, and all

hands are raised except the 8th Juror's.

FOREMAN
...Nine -- ten -- eleven. That's
eleven for "guilty". Okay, "Not

guilty."

The 8th Juror slowly raises his hand.

He resumes his seat.

FOREMAN
One. Right. Okay, eleven to one --
"Guilty". Now we know where we are.

3RD JUROR
(leaning over towards the 8th
juror)
Well, look, do you really think he's
innocent?
8TH JUROR

I don't know.

3RD JUROR
I mean, let's be reasonable. You sat
in court and heard the same things we
did. The man's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

8TH JUROR
The man! He's sixteen years old.

‘ 3RD JUROR
Well, that's old enough. He knifed
his own father. Four inches into the
chest.

6TH JUROR
(to the 8th Juror)
It's pretty obvious. I mean, I was
convinced from the first day.

3RD JUROR
Well, who wasn't?
(to the 8th Juror)
I really think this is one of those
open and shut things. They proved it
a dozen different ways. Would you
like me to list them for you?

8TH JUROR
No.

10TH JUROR
Then what. do you want?

8TH JUROR
Nothing. I just want to talk.
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

. 7TH JUROR
Well, what's there to talk about?
Eleven men here agree. Nobody had to
think twice about it, except you.

10TH JUROR
I want to ask you something. Do you
believe his story?

8TH JUROR
I don't know whether I believe it or
not. Maybe I don't.

7TH JUROR
So what'd you vote "not guilty" for?

8TH JUROR
There were eleven votes for “guilty.”
It's not easy for me to raise my hand
and send a°boy off to die without
talking about it first.

7TH JUROR
Who says it's.easy for me?
8TH JUROR
No-one.
7TH JUROR

What, just because I voted fast? I
think the guy's guilty. You couldn't
change my mind if you talked for a
hundred years.

8TH JUROR
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that we're talking about
somebody's life here. I mean, we
can't decide in five minutes.
Suppose we're wrong?

7TH JUROR
Suppose we're wrong! Suppose this
whole building fell on my head. You
can suppose anything.

8TH JUROR
That's right.

(after a pause)
What's the difference how long it
takes? We honestly think he's
guilty. So suppose we finish in five
minutes? So what?

8TH JUROR
Let's take an hour. The ball game
doesn't start till eight o'clock.

7TH JUROR
(smiling)
Okay, slugger, be my guest.

There is a silence.

FOREMAN
(hesitantly)
Well, who's got something to say?

He looks at the 2nd Juror.

2ND JUROR
Not me.

9TH JUROR
I'm willing to put in an hour.

10TH JUROR
Great. I heard a pretty good story
last night. This woman comes running
into the doctor's office, stripped to

the waist...

8TH JUROR
That's not what we're sitting here
for.

10TH JUROR

All right, then you tell me. What
are we sitting here for?

8TH JUROR

Maybe for no reason. I don't know.
Look, this boy's been kicked around
all his life. You know -- living in
a slum, his mother dead since he was
nine. He spent a year and a half in
an orphanage while his father served
a jail term for forgery. That's not
a very good head start. He's had a
pretty terrible sixteen years.
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

8TH JUROR (CONT)
I think maybe we owe him a few words.
That's all.

10TH JUROR
I don't mind telling you this,
mister. We don't owe him a thing.
He got a fair trial, didn't he? What
d'you think the trial cost? He's
lucky he got it. Know what I mean?
(he rises and looks around at the
others)
Look, we're all grown-ups here. We
heard the facts, didn't we? Now
you're not going to tell us that
we're supposed to believe that kid,
knowing what he is. Listen, I've
lived among 'em all my life. You
can't believe a word they say. You
know that. I mean, they're born
liars.

9TH JUROR
It suddenly occurs to me that you
must be an ignorant man.

10TH JUROR
What do you mean? What's he talking
about?

9TH JUROR
Do you think you have a monopoly on
the truth?

10TH JUROR
What are you making a Federal Case
out of it for?
(to the others)
How d’ya like this guy?

9TH JUROR
(to the others)
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

3RD JUROR
All right. It's not Sunday. We
don't need a sermon in here.

10TH JUROR
Monopoly! For Chrissakes.

The 9th Juror half rises but then feels the 8th Juror's hand firmly
on his arm, gently pulling him down. The 12th Juror doodles on his
notepad. : .

4TH JUROR
I don't see any need for arguing like
this. I think we ought to be able to
behave like gentlemen. If we're
going to discuss this case, let's
stick to the facts.

FOREMAN
I think that's a good point. We have
a job to do. Let's do it. Maybe if
the gentleman who's disagreeing down
there could tell us why. You know,
tell -us what he thinks -- we could
show him where he's probably mixed

up.
11TH JUROR
(looking at the.12th Juror's
doodle)

What's that?

12TH JUROR
Mmm?
(he holds up the doodle)
It's one of the products I work on at
the AD Agency. Rice Pops. "The
Breakfast with the Built-In Bounce."
I wrote that line.

11TH JUROR
(smiling in spite of himself)
It's very catchy.

FOREMAN
If you don't mind!

The 2nd Juror rises, goes to the coat-hooks and takes a package of
cough drops from his jacket pocket)

12TH JUROR
I'm sorry. I have this habit of
doodling. It keeps me thinking
clearly.

We're trying to get some place here.
Y'know we can sit here forever...
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

12TH JUROR
Well, look, maybe this is an idea.
I'm just thinking out loud, but it
seems to me it's up to us to convince
this gentleman --

(he indicates the 8th Juror)
that we're right and he's wrong.
Maybe if we each took a minute or
two. I mean it's just a quick

No, I think it's a good one.
Supposing we go once around the
table. :

7TH JUROR
Anything. Let's start it off.

FOREMAN
Okay. .
(to the 7th Juror)
How about you going first?

7TH JUROR
Not me. I think we oughta go in
order.

FOREMAN

That sounds fair. Okay, in order --
a coupla minutes apiece.

(To the 2nd Juror)
I guess you're first.

2ND JUROR
Oh. Well --
(he pauses nervously)
Well, it's hard to put into words. I
just -- think he's guilty. I thought
it was obvious from the word go. I
mean nobody proved otherwise.

8TH JUROR
Nobody has to prove otherwise. The
burden of proof is on the
prosecution. The defendant doesn't
have to open his mouth. That's in
the Constitution. You've heard of
it.
FIRST DRAFT + 2/14/96

2ND JUROR
(flustered)
Well, sure I've heard of it. I know
what it is. I -- what I meant --

well, the man is guilty. I mean,
somebody saw him do it.

He looks around helplessly.

3RD JUROR

Okay.

(he refers to his notes)
Now here's what I think, and I have
no personal feelings about this. I'm
talking facts. Number one. Let's
take the old man who lived on the
second floor right underneath the
room where the murder took place. At
ten minutes after twelve on the night
of the killing he heard loud noises
in the apartment upstairs. He said
it sounded like a fight. Then he
heard the kid shout out, "I'm gonna
kill you." A. second later he heard
a body fall and he ran to the door of
his apartment, looked out and saw the
kid running down the stairs and out
of the house. Then he called the
police. They found the father with a
knife in his chest.

FOREMAN
And the coroner fixed the time of the
death at around midnight.

3RD JUROR
Right. I mean, there are facts for
you. You can't refute facts. This
boy is guilty. Look, I'm as
sentimental as the next guy. I know
the kid is only sixteen, but he's
still got to pay for what he did.

7TH JUROR
I'm with you, pops.

4TH JUROR
(removing his eyeglasses)
It was obvious to me, anyway, that
the boy's entire story was flimsy.
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing and
yet one hour later he couldn't

played in them.

3RD JUROR
That's right. Did you hear that?
(to the 4th Juror)
You're absolutely right.

. _ 4TH JUROR
No-one saw him going into or out of
the theater.

10TH JUROR
Listen, what about that woman across
the street? If her testimony don't
prove it, nothing does. :

11TH JUROR
That's right. She was the one who
actually saw the killing.

FOREMAN
(half rising)
Let's go in order here.

10TH JUROR

(rising, handkerchief in hand)
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

(he blows his nose)
Here's a woman who's lying in bed and
can't sleep. She's dying with the
heat. Know what I mean? . Anyway, she
looks out the window and right across
the street she sees the kid stick the
knife into his father. The time is
twelve-ten on.the nose. Everything
fits. Look, she's known the kid all
his life. His window is right
opposite hers, across the el tracks,
and she swore she saw him do it.

8TH JUROR
Through the windows of a passing
elevated train.

10TH JUROR
Right. This el train had no
passengers on it. It was just being
moved downtown. The lights were out,
remember? And they proved in court
that at night you can look through
the windows of an el train when the
lights are out and see what's

I'd like to ask you something.

10TH JUROR
Sure.

You don't believe the boy. How come
you believe the woman? She's one of
"them", too, isn't she?

That's your privilege. How about the

6TH JUROR
I don't know. I started to be
convinced, uh -- you know, very early

in the case.. Well, I was looking for
the motive. That's very important.
If there's no motive, where's the
case? So, anyway, that testimony
from those people across the hall
from the kid's apartment, that was
very powerful. Didn't they say
something about an argument between
the father and the boy around seven
o'clock that night? I mean, I can be
wrong.

: 11TH JUROR
It was eight o'clock. Not seven.

8TH JUROR
That's right. Eight o'clock. They
heard an argument, but they couldn't
hear. what it was about. Then they
heard the father hit the boy twice,
and finally they saw the boy walk
angrily out of the house. What does
that prove?

6TH JUROR
Well, it doesn't exactly prove
anything. It's just part of the
picture. I didn't say it proved
anything.

8TH JUROR
You said it revealed a motive for the
killing. The prosecuting attorney
said the same thing. Well, I don't
think it's a very strong motive.
This boy has been hit so many times
in his life that violence is
practically a normal state of affairs
for him. I can't see two slaps in
the face provoking him into
committing murder.

How about the next gentleman?

7TH JUROR

Me? .

(he pauses, looks around, shrugs)
I don’t know, it’s practically all
said already. We can talk about it
forever. I mean, this kid is oh for
five. Look at his record. He was in
Chidren’s Court when he was ten for
throwing a rock at his teacher. At
fourteen he was in Reform School. He
stole a car. He’s been arrested for
mugging. He was picked up twice for
tyring to slash another teenager with
a knife. He’s real quick with switch
knives, they said. This is a very
fine boy.

8TH JUROR
Ever since he was five years old his
father beat him up regularly. He
used his fists.

7TH JUROR
So would I. A kid like that.

motive for him to kill his father?

8TH JUROR
(after a pause)
I don't know. It's a motive for him
to be an angry kid. I'11 say that.

3RD JUROR
It's the kids, the way they are
mowadays. Angry! Hostile! You
can't do a damn thing with them.
Just. the way they talk to you.
Listen, when I was his age I used to
call my father. "Sir". That’s right.
Sir! You ever hear a boy call his
father that any more?

8TH JUROR
Fathers don't seem to think it's
important any more.

3RD JUROR

No? Have you got any kids?
8TH JUROR

Two.
3RD JUROR

Yeah, well I've got one. He's
twenty. We did everything for that
boy and what happened? When he was
nine he ran away from a fight. I saw
him. I was so ashamed I almost threw
up. So I told him right out. "I'm
gonna make a man outta you or I'm
gonna bust you in half trying."

Well, I made a man outta him all -
right. When he was sixteen we had a
battle. He hit me in the face. He's
big, y'know. I haven't seen him in
two years. Rotten kid. You work
your heart out...

He has said more than he intended. He is

3RD JUROR
All right. Let's get on with it.

4TH JUROR (CONT)
We're here to decide whether he's
guilty or‘“innocent of murder, not to
go into reasons why he grew up this
way: He was born in a slum. Slums
are breeding grounds for criminals.
I know it. So-do you. It's no
secret: Children from slum
backgrounds are potential menaces to
society. Now I think...

Brother, you can say that again. The
kids who crawl outta those places are
real trash. I don't want any part of
them. I'm telling you.

I don't care what you do.

8TH JUROR

All right. I haven't got anything

you do. According to the testimony
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

up. Everybody sounded so positive
that I started to get a peculiar
feeling about this trial. I mean,
nothing is that positive. I had
questions I would have liked to ask.
Maybe they wouldn't have meant
anything. I don't know. But I
started to feel that the defense
counsel wasn't doing his job. He let
too many things go. Little things.

10TH JUROR
What little things? Listen, when
these guys don't ask questions,
that's because they know the answers
already and they figure they'll be
hurt.

8TH JUROR
Maybe. It's also possible for a
lawyer to be just plain stupid, isn't
it?

6TH JUROR
You sound like you've met my
brother-in-law.

A few jurors laugh.

8TH JUROR

(smiling) :
I kept putting myself in the boy's
place. I would have asked for
another lawyer, I think. I mean, if
I was on trial for my life I'd want
my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least to
try. Look, there was one alleged
eye-witness to this killing. Someone
else claims he heard the killing and
then saw the boy running out
afterwards. There was a lot of
circumstantial evidence, but actually
those two witnesses were the entire
case for the prosecution. Supposing
they were wrong?

12TH JUROR
What do you mean, "Supposing they
were wrong?" What's the point of
having witnesses at all?"

Let's try to get to the point here.
What about the switch-knife they

Well, wait a minute. I think we

haven't talked yet. Shouldn't we...?

3RD JUROR

Look, they can talk whenever they
like. Now just be quiet a second,
will you.

(he turns to the 8th Juror)
Okay, what about the knife? You
know, the one that fine, upright boy
admitted buying on the night of the
murder. Let's talk about that.

8TH JUROR
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.
I'd like to see it again. (He turns
to the Foreman) Mr. Foreman?

The Foreman rises and crosses to the door.

3RD JUROR
We all know what it looks like.

The Foreman knocks on the door. The Guard enters. The Foreman
whispers to him. The Guard nods and exits.

3RD JUROR
What are we gonna get out of seeing
it again?

5TH JUROR

You brought it up.

4TH JUROR
The gentleman has a right to see
exhibits in evidence.
(to the 8th Juror)
The knife, and the way it was bought,
is pretty strong evidence. Don't you
think so?

8TH JUROR
I do.

4TH JUROR
Good. Now suppose we take these
facts one at a time. One. The boy
admitted going out of his house at
eight o’clock on the night of the
murder after being punched several
times by his father.

8TH JUROR
He didn't say "punched". He said
"hit". There's a difference between

a slap and a punch.

4TH JUROR
After being hit several times by his
father, Two. The boy went directly
to a neighborhood junk shop where he
bought a... What do you call these
things --

' 3RD JUROR
Switch-knives.

3RD JUROR/4TH JUROR
--a switchblade knife.
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

30.

4TH JUROR

(to the 3rd Juror)
Thank you: Three. This wasn't what
you'd call an ordinary knife. It had
a very unusual carved handle. Four.
The storekeeper who sold it to him
identified the knife in court and
said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock. Five. At,
oh, about eight-forty-five the boy
ran into three friends of his in
front of a diner. Am I correct so
far?

8TH JUROR
Yes, you are.

3RD JUROR
(to the 8th Juror)
You bet he is.
(to the others)
Now listen to this man. He knows
what he's talking about.

4TH JUROR -
The boy talked with his friends for
about an hour, leaving them at nine-
forty-five. During this time they
saw the switch-knife. Six. Each of
them identified the death weapon in
court as that same knife. Seven.
The boy arrived home at about ten
o'clock. Now this is where the
stories offered by the boy and the
State begin to diverge slightly. He
claims that he stayed home until
eleven-thirty and then went to one of
those all-night movies. He returned
home at about three-fifteen in the
morning to find his father dead and
himself arrested. Now, what happened
to the switch-knife? This is the
charming and imaginative little fable
the boy invented. He claims that the
knife fell through a hole in his
pocket some time between eleven-
thirty and three-fifteen while he was
on his trip to the movies and that he
never saw it again. Now this is a
tale, gentlemen. I think it's quite
clear that the boy never went to the
movies that night.
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96 31

4TH JUROR (CONT)
No one in the house saw-him go out at
eleven-thirty. No one at the theater
identified him. He couldn't even
remember the names of the pictures he
saw. What actually happened is this:
the boy stayed home, had. another
fight with his father, stabbed him to
death with the knife at ten minutes
after twelve and fled from the house.
He even remembered to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints.

The Guard enters carrying a curiously designed knife with a tag
hanging from-it. The 4th Juror goes to the Guard, takes the knife
from him. The guard exits.

4TH JUROR (CONT)
Everyone connected with the case
identified the knife. Now are you
trying to tell me that it really fell
through a hole in the boy's pocket
and that someone picked it up off the
‘street, went to the boy's house and
stabbed his father with it just to be
amusing?

8TH JUROR
No. I'm saying it's possible that
the boy lost the knife and that
someone else stabbed his father with
a similar knife. It's possible.

The 4th Juror flicks open the knife and jams it into the table.

4TH JUROR
Take a look at that knife. I've
never seen one like it. Neither had
the storekeeper who sold it to the
boy. Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

8TH JUROR
I'm not asking anyone to accept it.
I'm just saying that it's possible.

(shouting)
And I'm saying it's not possible.

The 8th Juror stands for a moment in silence, then he reaches into
his pocket and swiftly withdraws a knife. He olds it in front of
his face and flicks open the blade, then he leans forward and
sticks the knife into the table alongside the other. They are
exactly alike. There is a burst of sound in the room. The 8th
Juror stands back from the table, watching.

I was walking for a couple of hours
last night, just thinking. I walked
through the boy's neighborhood. The
knife comes from a little pawnshop
three blocks from his house. It cost
six dollars.

4TH JUROR
It's against the law to buy or sell
switch-blade knives.

8TH JUROR
That's right. I broke the law.

trick here. Now supposing you tell
me what you proved? Maybe there are

Maybe there are.

So what does that mean? It's the
same kind of knife. So what's that?
The discovery of the age or
something?

It would still be an incredible
coincidence for another person to
have stabbed the father with the same
kind of knife.

3RD JUROR
I know. He claims he bought it as a
present for a friend of his. He was
gonna give it to him the next day
because he busted the other kid’s
knife dropping it on the pavement.

8TH JUROR
That's what he said.

7TH JUROR
Baloney!

9TH JUROR

The friend testified that the boy did
break his knife.

3RD JUROR
Yeah. And how long before the
killing? Three weeks. Right? So
how come our noble lad bought this
knife one half hour after his father
smacked him and three and a half
hours before they found it shoved up
to here in the father's chest?

7TH JUROR
Well, he was gonna give the knife to
his friend. He just wanted to use it
for a minute.

There is scattered laughter.

8TH JUROR

(to the 3rd Juror)
Let me ask you this. It's one of the
questions I wanted to ask in court.
If the boy bought the knife to use on
his father, how come he showed what
was going to be the murder weapon to
three friends of his just a couple of
hours before the killing?

3RD JUROR
Listen, all of this is just talk.
The boy lied and you know it.

8TH JUROR

He may have lied.
(to 10th Juror)
Do you think he lied?

he lied.

You don't have to ask me that. You
know my answer. He lied.

8TH JUROR
(to 5th Juror)
Do you think he lied?

5TH JUROR

He breaks off and looks nervously around.

3RD JUROR
(leaping into the breach)
Maybe! Now wait a second.
(to 8th Juror)
What are you, the kid's lawyer or
something? Who do you think you are
to start cross-examining us?

8TH JUROR
Isn't that what's supposed to happen
in a jury room?

3RD JUROR
Listen, there are still eleven of us
in here who think he's guilty.

7TH JUROR
Yeah. What do you think you're gonna
accomplish? You're not gonna change
anybody's mind. So if you want to be
stubborn and hang this jury, go
ahead. The kid’s be tried again and
found guilty sure as he's born.

You're probably right.

Well, that's all. I£ you want to try
it, I'm ready.

3RD JUROR
Well, finally you're behaving like a
reasonable man.

12TH JUROR
Check. I'11 buy that.

7TH JUROR
Okay. Let's do it.

FOREMAN
That sounds fair.

Some of the Jurors nod. The 8th Juror moves to the window.

FOREMAN (CONT)
Anyone doesn't agree? Okay. Pass
these along.

He passes out the slips of paper.

The 8th Juror stands watching the others. The Jurors pass the
slips along. Finally each of them begins to write. Now some of
them begin to fold their slips and pass them back to the Foreman.
The Foreman stacks all the slips on the table in front of him. He
picks up the first slip of paper, opens it and reads:

FOREMAN ~
Guilty.
(he opens and reads the other
slips in turn)
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
Not. Guilty.

There is a babble of voices. The 8th Juror relaxes, moves to his
chair and sits. Foreman reads the last slip.

FOREMAN
Guilty.

11TH JUROR
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.
We agreed on this. .

3RD JUROR
Secret? What d'ya mean, secret?
There are no secrets in a jury room.
I know who it was.

(he. crosses to the 5th Juror)
Brother, you're really something!
You come in here and you vote guilty
like everybody else, and then this
golden-voiced preacher over here
starts to tear your heart out with
stories about a poor little kid who
just couldn't help becoming a
murderer. So you change your vote.
If that isn't the most sickening...
Why don'tcha drop a quarter in his

. collection box?

5TH JUROR
Now wait a minute.

(the 3rd juror turns away)
You can’t talk to me like that!

The 3rd Juror turns to face him. The 4th Juror slips in between

them and takes

the 5th Juror by the arm.

5TH JUROR
No.
(he shakes off the 4th Juror).
Where does he get the right to shout
at me?

4TH JUROR
All right. Let's calm down.

5TH JUROR
Who does he think he is? I mean, did
you see him?

4TH JUROR
Just sit down. He's very excitable.
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

3RD JUROR
You bet I!m excitable. We're trying
to put a guilty man into the chair
where he belongs and all of a sudden
somebody's telling us fairy tales --
and we're listening.

2ND JUROR
(mildly)
Take it easy.

3RD JUROR
What do you mean -- take it easy!
D'you feel like seeing a proven
murderer walking the streets? Why
don't we give him his knife back?
Make it easier for him.

FOREMAN
Okay, let's stop the yelling. Who's
got something constructive to say?

11TH JUROR
Please. I would like to say
something here. I have always thought
that in this country a man was
entitled to have unpopular
opinions... ,

7TH JUROR
Let's stick to the subject.
(to the 5th Juror)
What made you change your vote?

9TH JUROR
He didn't change his vote. I did.
Would you like me to tell you why?

7TH JUROR
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me
why.

9TH JUROR

Well I'd like to make it clear,
anyway, if you don't mind.

10TH JUROR

9TH JUROR
Thank you.

(to the 7th Juror)
This gentleman --

(he indicates the 8th Juror)
has been standing alone against us.
He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.
He just isn't sure. Well, it's not
easy to stand alone against the
ridicule of others. He gambled for
support and I gave it to him. I
respect his motives. The boy on
trial is probably guilty. But I want
to hear more.

(The 7th Juror crosses to the

washroom)
For the time being the vote is ten to
two. .
(the 7th Juror enters the
washroom, slams the door after
him) :
I'm talking here. You have no right
to...

8TH JUROR
(to 9th Juror)
He can't hear you. He never will.
Let's sit down.

3RD JUROR
Well, if the speech is over, maybe we
can go on.

FOREMAN

I think we ought to take a break.
One man's inside there. Let's wait
for him.

The Foreman moves above the table.to where the two knives are stuck
into it. He plucks the tagged knife out and closes it.

12TH JUROR
(to 11th Juror)

Looks like we're really hung up here.
I mean, that thing with the old man
was pretty unexpected. I wish I knew
how we could break this up.

(he suddenly smiles)
Y'know, in advertising... I told you
I worked at an ad agency, didn't I?

The Foreman crosses to the door and knocks. The Guard enters. The
Foreman hands him the knife. The Guard exits.

12TH JUROR

Well, there are some pretty strange
people -- not strange, really -- they
just have peculiar ways of expressing
themselves, y'know what I mean?

(the 11th Juror nods)
Well, it’s probably the same in your
business -- right? What do you do?

11TH JUROR
I'm a watchmaker.

12TH JUROR
Really? The finest watchmakers come
from Europe, I imagine.

The llth Juror bows slightly. The 6th Juror rises, goes into the
bathroom.

12 JUROR
Anyway, I was telling you -- in the
agency, when they reach a point like
this in a meeting, there's always
‘some character ready with an idea.
And it kills me, I mean it's the
weirdest thing sometimes the way they
precede the idea with some kind of
phrase. Like -- oh, some account
exec'll say, "Here's an idea. Let's
run it up the flagpole and see if
anyone salutes it," or "Put it ona
bus and see if it gets off at Wall
Street." I mean, it's idiotic, but
it's funny.

8th Juror goes into the washroom and hangs his jacket on a hook.
3rd Juror crosses to 5th Juror.

- 3RD JUROR
(to 5th Juror)
Look, I was a little excited. Well,
you know how it is -- I didn't mean
to get nasty or anything.

5th Juror crosses away from 3rd Juror without answering. 7th Juror
steps away from the washbasin and dries his hands. The 8th Juror
crosses to washbasin.

not bad. Considering marmalade.

(he watches the 8th Juror for a

moment )
What are ya getting out of it --
kicks? The boy is guilty, pal. So
let's go home before we get sore
throats.

8TH JUROR
What's the difference whether you get
one here or at the ball game?

7TH JUROR
No difference pal... No difference at
all.

7th Juror exits the washroom. 6th Juror enters from the lavatory,

goes to the washbasin and washes his hands.

6TH JUROR
(to the 8th Juror)
Nice bunch of guys.

8TH JUROR
I guess they're the same as any.

6TH JUROR
That loud, heavy-set guy, the one who
was tellin' us about his kid -- the
way he was talking -- boy, that was
an embarrassing thing.

8TH JUROR
Yeah.

6TH JUROR
What a murderous day. You think
we'll be here much longer?

8TH JUROR
I don't know.

6TH JUROR
He's guilty for sure. There's not a

wastin' your time.

8TH JUROR
Suppose you were the one on trial?

6TH JUROR
I'm not used to supposing. I'm just
a working man. My boss does the
supposing. But I'll try one.
Suppose you talk us all outta this
and the kid really did knife his
father?

The 6th Juror looks at the 8th Juror for a moment. then goes into
Do the jury room. The 8th Juror stands alone for a few moments and we

know that this is the problem which has been tormenting him. He

does not know, and never will. He switches out the washroom light,

goes into the jury room.

FOREMAN
Okay, let's take seats.

2ND JUROR
Looks like we'll be here for dinner.

FOREMAN
Okay. Let's get down to business.

There is a pause, then the 4th and 6th Jurors start to speak at the
same time.

6TH JUROR/4TH JUROR
Well, I'd like to make a point...

4TH JUROR
(t6 the 6th juror)
I'm sorry, go ahead.

6TH JUROR
I didn't mean to interrupt.

4TH JUROR
No. Go ahead. It's all right.

6TH JUROR

Well, I was going to say, well, this
is probably a small point, but
anyway...

(to the 8th Juror)
The boy had a motive for the killing.
You know, the beatings and all. So
if he didn't do it, who did? Who
else had the motive? That's my
point. JI mean, nobody goes out and
kills someone without a motive, not
unless he's just plain nuts. Right?

8TH JUROR
As far as I know we're supposed to
decide whether or not the boy on
trial is guilty beyond a reasonable -
doubt. We're not concerned with
anyone else's motives here. That's a
job for the police.

4TH JUROR

Very true. But we can't help letting
the only motive we know of creep into
our thoughts, can we? And we can't
help asking ourselves who else might
have had a motive. Logically, these
things follow.

(he nods towards the 6th juror)
This gentleman is asking a reasonable
question.. Somebody killed him. If
it wasn't the boy, who was it?

3RD JUROR
Modjelewski.

7TH JUROR
You're talking about the man I love!
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

4TH JUROR
If you haven't got anything to add
besides jokes, I suggest you listen.

3RD JUROR
Okay. It's just letting off steam.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

4TH JUROR
(to the 8th Juror)
Well, maybe you can answer me. Who
else might have killed the father?

_ 8TH JUROR

Well, I don't know. The father
wasn't exactly a model citizen. The
boy's lawyer outlined is background
in his.closing statement. He was in
prison once. He was known to be a
compulsive gambler and a pretty
consistent loser. .He spent a lot of
time in neighborhood bars and he'd
get into fist fights sometimes after
a couple of drinks. Usually over a
woman. He was a tough, cruel,
primitive kind of man who never held
a job for more than six months in his
life. So here are a few
possibilities. He could have been
murdered by one of many men he served
time with in prison. By a bookmaker.
By a man he'd beaten up. By a woman
he'd picked up. By any one of the
rough characters he was known to hang
out with.

10TH JUROR
Boy-oh-boy, that's the biggest load
of crap I ever... Listen, we know the

father was a bum. So what has that
got to do with anything?

_ 8TH JUROR

I didn't bring it up. I was asked
who else might have killed him. I
gave my answer.

9TH JUROR
(pointing at 4th Juror)
That gentleman over there asked a
direct question.
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

46
10TH JUROR
Everyone's a lawyer!

3RD JUROR
Look, suppose you answer this for me.
The old man who lived downstairs
heard the kid yell out, "I'm going to
kill you." A split second later he
heard a body hit the floor. Then he
saw the kid run out of the house.
Now what does all that mean to you?

8TH JUROR
I was wondering how clearly the old
man could have heard the boy's voice
through the ceiling.

3RD JUROR
He didn't hear it through the
ceiling. His window was open and so
was the window upstairs. It was a
hot night, remember?

8TH JUROR

’ The voice came from another

apartment. It's not easy to identify
a voice, especially a shouting voice.

FOREMAN
He identified it in court. He picked
the boy's voice out of five other
voices, blindfolded.

8TH JUROR
That was just an ambitious district
attorney putting on a show. Look,
the old man knows the boy's voice
very well. They've lived in the same
house for years. But to identify it
positively from the apartment
downstairs... Isn't it possible he
was wrong -- that maybe he thought
the boy was upstairs and
automatically decided that the voice
he heard was the boy's voice?

4TH JUROR
I think that's a bit far-fetched.

10TH JUROR

10TH JUROR (CONT)
(to the 8th Juror)
Look. The old man heard the father's
body falling and then he saw the boy
run out of the house fifteen seconds
later. He saw the boy.

12 JUROR
Check. And don't forget the woman
across the street. She looked right
into the open window and saw the boy
stab his father. I mean, isn't that
enough for you?

- 8TH JUROR
Not right now. No, it isn't.

7TH JUROR
How do you like him? It's like
talking into a dead phone.

4TH JUROR
The woman saw the killing through the
windows of a moving elevated train.
The train had six cars and she saw it
through the windows of the last two
cars. She remembered the most
significant details. I don't see how
you can argue with that.

3RD JUROR
(to 8th Juror)
Well, what have you got to say about
it?

8TH JUROR
I don't know. It doesn't sound right
to me.

3RD JUROR

The 12th Juror hands the pencil to 3rd Juror who starts to draw
what is obviously a tic-tac-toe pattern on the pad.

What would you say?

Ten seconds. Approximately.

4TH JUROR
All right. Say ten seconds. What
are you getting at?

8TH JUROR
This. It takes a six car el train
ten seconds to pass a given point.
Now say that given point is the open
window of the room in which the

8TH JUROR (CONT)
killing took place. You can almost
reach out ‘the window of that room and
touch the el tracks. Right?

5TH JUROR
Right.

8TH JUROR
All right. Now let me ask you this -
- has anyone here ever lived right
next to the el tracks?

6TH JUROR
Well, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.
I'm a house painter, y'know. I was
there for three days.

8TH JUROR
What was it like?

6TH JUROR
-What d'ya mean?

8TH JUROR
Noisy?

6TH JUROR

Brother! Well, it didn't matter.
We're all punch in our business,
anyway.

8TH JUROR
I lived in a second-floor apartment
next to an el line once. When the
window's open and the train goes by,
the noise is almost unbearable. You
can't hear yourself think.

3RD JUROR
Okay. You can't hear yourself think.
Will you get to the point!

8TH JUROR
I will. Let's take two pieces of
testimony and try to put them
together. First, the old man in the
apartment downstairs. He says he
heard the boy say, "I'm going to kill
you," and a split second later he
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

51

8TH JUROR (CONT)
heard the. body hit the floor. One
second later. Right?

2ND JUROR
That's right.

. 8TH JUROR ,

Second, the woman in the apartment
across the street. She claimed that
she looked out of her window and saw
the killing through the last two cars
of a passing elevated train. Right?
The last two cars.

_ 3RD JUROR
All right. What point are you making
here? .

8TH JUROR
Now, we agreed that an el train takes
about ten seconds to pass a given
point. Since the woman saw the
‘stabbing through the last two cars we
can assume that the boy fell to the
floor just as the train passed by.
Therefore, the el train had been
roaring by the old man's window for a
full ten seconds before the body
fell. The old man, according to his
own testimony, hearing "I'm going to
kill you" and the body falling a
split second later, would have had to
hear the boy make this statement
while the el was roaring past his
nose. It's not possible that he
could have heard it.

3RD JUROR
That's idiotic! Sure he could have
heard it.

8TH JUROR
(to 3rd Juror)
Do you think so?

3RD JUROR
The old man said the boy yelled it
out. That's enough for me.

8TH JUROR
If he heard anything at all, he still
couldn't have identified the voice
with the el rearing by.

 
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

You're talking about a matter. of
seconds here. Nobody can be that
accurate.

8TH JUROR

could put a human being into the
electric chair should be that
accurate.

5TH JUROR .
I don't think he could have heard it.

6TH JUROR
Yeah. Maybe he didn't hear it. I
mean, with the el noise...

3RD JUROR
What are you people talking about?

5TH JUROR
Well, it stands to reason...

3RD JUROR
You're crazy! Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

sayings. Why don't you send one in

The 3rd Juror looks at the 6th Juror then turns disgustedly away.
The 6th Juror reaches out and turns the 3rd Juror firmly around by
the arm.

again -- I'm gonna lay you out.

(he releases the 3rd Juror and

speaks to the 9th Juror)
Go ahead. You can say anything you
want. Why do you think the old man
might lie?

9TH JUROR ~
It's just that I looked at him fora
very long time. The seam of his
jacket was split under his arm. Did
you notice it? I mean, to come into
court like that. He was a very old
man with a torn jacket and he walked
very slowly to the stand. He was
dragging his left leg and trying to
hide it ‘because he was ashamed. I
think I know him better than anyone
here. This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who has been
nothing all his life, who has never
had recognition, his name in the
newspapers. Nobody knows him, nobody
quotes him, nobody seeks his advice
after seventy-five years. That's a
very sad thing, to be nothing. A man
like this needs to be recognized, to
be listened to, to be quoted just
once. This is very important. It
would be so hard for him to recede Q
into the background when there's a
chance to be...

7TH JUROR
Now, wait a minute. Are you trying
to tell us he'd lie just so that he
could be important once?

9TH JUROR
No. He wouldn't really lie. But
perhaps he'd make himself believe
that he'd heard those words and
recognized the boy's face.

10TH JUROR
Well, that's the most fantastic story
I've ever heard. How can you make up
a think like that? what do you know
about it?

There's another think I wanted to
talk about for a minute. I think
we've proved that the old man
couldn't have heard the boy say, "I'm
going to kill you," but supposing...

10TH JUROR
You didn't prove it at all. What are
you talking about?

But supposing he really did hear it.
This phrase, how many times has each
of us used it? Probably hundreds.
"I could kill you for that, darling."
"TE you do that once more, Junior,
I'm going to kill you."  "'Come on,

it. Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

Well, gee, I don't know. I remember
I was arguing with the guy I work

kid said he was going to kill him and
he did kill him.

8TH JUROR
The lawyér was court-appointed.

7TH JUROR
So what does that mean?

Well, it could mean a lot of things.
It could mean he didn't want the

money. No glory. Not even much
chance of winning. It's not a very
promising situation for a young
lawyer. He'd really have to believe
in his client to put up a good fight.
As you pointed out a minute ago, he
obviously didn't.

7TH JUROR
Sure he didn't. Who in hell could,
except God come to earth or somebody?
(he looks at his watch then up at
the clock)
Come on already! Look at the time!

11TH JUROR
Pardon me, but I have made some notes
here.

10TH JUROR
Notes yet!

11TH JUROR

I would like please to say something.
I have been listening very closely,
and it seems to me that this man --

(he indicates the 8th Juror)
has some very good points to make.
From what was presented at the trial
the boy looks guilty, but maybe if we
go deeper...

10TH JUROR
Come on, will ya.

11TH JUROR
There is a question I would like to
ask. We assume that the boy
committed murder. He stabbed his
father in the chest and ran away.
This was at ten minutes after twelve.
Now, how was he caught by the police?
He came home at three o'clock or so
and was captured by two detective in
the hallway of his house. My
question is, if he really had killed
his father, why would he come back
three hours later? Wouldn't he be
afraid of being caught?
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

58
3RD JUROR
Look -- he came home to get his
knife. It's not nice to leave knives
sticking around in people's chests.

7TH JUROR
Yeah, especially relatives.

4TH JUROR
I don't see anything funny about it.
(to the 11th Juror)
The boy knew that there were people
who could identify the knife as the
one he had just bought. He had to
get it before the police did.

11TH JUROR
But if he knew the knife could be
identified, why did he leave it there
in the first place?

4TH JUROR
Well, I think we can assume he ran
out in a state of panic after he
killed his father, and then when he
finally calmed down, he realized that
he had left the knife there.

11TH JUROR
This then depends on your definition
of panic. He was calm enough to see
to-it that there were no fingerprints
on the knife. Now where did his
panic. start and where did it end?

3RD JUROR
Look, you can forget all that other
stuff. He still came home to dig out
his knife and get rid of it.

11TH JUROR
Three hours later?

3RD JUROR
Sure, three hours later.

11TH JUROR
If I were the boy and I had killed my
father, I would not have come home
three hours later. I would be afraid
that the police would be there. I
would stay away, knife or no knife.

3RD JUROR
Listen, you voted "guilty", didn't
you? What side are you on?

11TH JUROR
I don't believe I have to be loyal to
one side or the other. I am simply
asking questions.

12TH JUROR
Well, this is just off the top of my
head, but if I were the boy, and I'd,
you know, done the stabbing and
everything, I'd take a chance and go
back for the knife. I'll bet he
figured no one had seen him and that
the body probably wasn't even
discovered yet. After all, it was
the middle of the night. He probably
thought no one would find the boy
till the next day.”

11TH JUROR
Pardon. Here.is my whole point. . The
woman across the street testified
that a moment after she saw the
killing, that is, a moment after the
el train went by, she screamed and
then went to telephone the police.
Now, the boy must certainly have
heard that scream and known that
somebody saw something. I don't
think he would have gone back if he
had been the murderer.

4TH JUROR
Two points. One: in his state of
panic he may not have heard the
scream. Perhaps it wasn't very loud. .
Two: if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.
Remember he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly
commonplace.

3RD JUROR
Right! There's your answer.

8TH JUROR
Maybe. Maybe he did stab his father,
didn't hear the woman's scream, did
run out in a panic, did calm down
three hours later and come back to
try to get the knife, risking being

those things are so. But maybe
they're not. I think there's enough
doubt to make us wonder whether he
was there at all during the time the
murder took place.

What d'ya mean doubt? What are you

He's twisting the facts. I'm telling

He's an old man. You saw him. Half
the time he was confused. How could
he be positive about anything.

The Guard enters carrying a large diagram of the apartment. The
diagram is a layout of a railroad flat. A bedroom faces the el
tracks. Behind it is a series of rooms off a long hall. In the
front room is an "X" marking the spot where the body was found. At
the back of the apartment we see the entrance into the apartment
hall from the building hall. We see a flight of stairs in the
building hall. Each room is labeled and the dimensions of each
room are shown. Foreman takes diagram. Guard exits.

I don't see what we're going to prove
here. The man said he saw the boy
running out.

8TH JUROR
Well, let's see if the details bear
him out. As soon as the body fell to
the floor, he said, he heard
footsteps upstairs running towards
the front door. He heard the
upstairs door open and the footsteps
start down the stairs. He got to his
front door as soon as he could. He
swore that it couldn't have been more
than fifteen seconds. Now, if the

Now, the old man was in bed in this
room.

He says he got up, went out into the

door, opened it and looked out just
in time to see the boy racing down

...twelve feet from his bed to the
bedroom door. The length of the hall
is forty-three feet, six inches.
Now,. he had to get up out of bed,
walk twelve feet, open the bedroom
door, walk forty-three feet and open

the front door -- all in fifteen
seconds. Do you think he could have
done it?

He can only walk very slowly. They

He didn't bring it up because he knew

d’ya think of that?

FOREMAN
Okay...

8TH JUROR
It's possible that he didn't bring it
up because it would have meant
badgering and bullying a helpless old
man, something that I don't think
sits very well with a jury. Most
lawyers avoid that kind of thing if
they can.

7TH JUROR
So what kind of a bum is he, then?

That's what I've been asking. All

the bedroom door. He reaches it and pretends to open the door. He
then hobbles along the simulated forty-three-foot hallway.

9TH JUROR
I don't think the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it. The
facts are supposed to determine the
case.

10TH JUROR
Ah, don't give me any of that. I'm
sick and tired of facts. You can
twist 'em any way you like. Know
what I mean?

It's very hot in here.

11TH JUROR
Do you want some water?

9TH JUROR
No, thanks.

It has grown considerably darker in the room and its oppressively
still. There is a murmur of voices at the cooler where the 7th,
10th, and 2nd Jurors are in various stages of getting a drink.

2ND JUROR
It's going to rain.

7TH JUROR
No! How did you figure that out,
blue eyes? Tell me, how come you
switched?

2ND JUROR
Well, it just seemed to me...

7TH JUROR
I mean, you haven't got a leg to
stand on. You know that, don'tcha?

2ND JUROR
Well, I don't feel that way.
There're a lot of details that never

yourself get bull-dozed by a bunch'a
what d'ya call ‘em -- intellectuals.

(the 10th Juror walks away.)
(softly)
Loudmouth!

It is now darker than before. There is no movement in the room.
Everyone waits for the storm. And suddenly it comes.. We hear only
the sound of the rain pouring down into the silence. Heads turn
toward the window. The rain pours down.

The 4th Juror goes into the washroom and exits to the lavatory.

The 8th Juror steps back from the window as the rain splashes in,
closes it. The Foreman rises, goes to the light switch at the door
and switches on the lights. There is a flickering of harsh white
light as.the fluorescent lights come on. The rain, continues
throughout the remainder of the film. The Foreman moves to the 8th
Juror.

FOREMAN
Wow! Look at that come down, will
ya. Think it'll cool things off?

8TH JUROR .
Yeah, I guess so.
‘ FOREMAN
Boy! Look at it go! Reminds me of
the storm we had last -- November

something. What a storm! Right in
the middle of the game.

7TH JUROR
Hey, let's try to get this fan goin'

The 4th Juror enters the washroom from the lavatory. The Foreman
goes to the bench, stands on it and starts the fan.

7TH JUROR (CONT)
It musta been connected to the light
switch.

3rd Juror and 4th Juror are in the washroom together.

3RD JUROR

Some rain, huh?

(the 4th Juror nods)
Well, what d'ya think of this thing?
It's even-steven.

suprising, isn’t it?

4TH JUROR
Yes. :

3RD JUROR
Listen, that business before, you
know, where that guy was baiting me.
I mean, that doesn't prove anything.
Listen, I'm a very excitable person,
y'know. So where does he get off to
call me a public avenger and a sadist
and everything? Anybody in his right
mind’d blow his stack, wouldn't he?
He was just trying to bait me.

4TH JUROR
He did an excellent job.

Excuse me.

Well -- isn't this the god-damnedest

It's a joke.

3RD JUROR
What are we gonna do about it? Can't
we break it somehow?

10TH JUROR -
Those six bastards in there aren't

4TH JUROR
Five of them already have changed
their minds. There's no reason why
they can't be persuaded to do it
again.

10TH JUROR
How?

4TH JUROR
Just by using logic.

10TH JUROR
Logic! Holy cow!

Judge -- we'll be here all night.
For chrissakes let's tell him we're
hung. The hell with this. I mean,
what am I gonna do, break my brains
over scum like that?

3RD JUROR
Well, that's the most ridiculous
think I ever... You took an oath in

the courtroom. You can't just quit.

10TH JUROR
Why not?

3RD JUROR
It's dishonest. Why don't you vote
not guilty?

10TH JUROR
I voted guilty because I think he's
guilty.

3RD JUROR
But you don't care what happens to
him?

10TH JUROR
No. Why should I?

4TH JUROR
All right, let's stop this. We're
not going to get anywhere like this.

10TH JUROR
Well, what does he want? I gave my
honest opinion.

The Foreman opens the washroom door.

The 4th Juror exits the washroom.

10TH JUROR
(to the 3rd Juror)
How about him? Is that something?

3RD JUROR
A hung jury doesn't mean anything.
They just have to start the trial
with another jury. That's not what
we're here for.

10TH JUROR
What the hell's the difference? A
hung jury is what you're gonna get.

You still don't think there's any

No, I don’t.

Pardon. Maybe you don't fully

What d'ya mean, I don't understand
it? Who the hell are you to talk to
me like that?

(to the others)
How d'ya like this guy? I'm tellin'

to this country running for his life
and before he can even take a big
breath he's telling us how to run the

: FOREMAN
All right. Let's stop arguing for
two minutes in here. Can't we stick
to the subject?

8TH JUROR

I'd like to go over something, if you
gentlemen don't mind. An important
point for the prosecution was the
fact that the boy, after he claimed
he was at the movies during the hours
the killing took place, couldn't name
the pictures he saw or the stars who
appeared in them.

(he points to the 4th Juror)
This gentleman has repeated that
point in here several times.

4TH. JUROR
That's correct. It was the only alibi
the boy offered and he himself
couldn't back it up with any details
at all. :

8TH JUROR
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
if you can, do you think you'd be
able to remember details after an

- upsetting experience such as being

struck in the face by your father?

4TH JUROR
I think so, if there were any special
details to remember. He couldn't
remember the movies at the theater he
named because he wasn't there that
night.

8TH JUROR
According to the police testimony in
court he was questioned by the police
in the kitchen of his apartment while
the body of his father was lying on
the floor in the bedroom. Do you
think you could remember details
under such circumstances?

4TH. JUROR
I do.

8TH JUROR
Under great emotional stress?
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

85

4TH JUROR
Under gréat emotional stress.

8TH JUROR
He remembered the movies in court.
He named them correctly and he named
the stars who played in them.

4TH JUROR
Yes, his lawyer took great pains to
bring that out. He had three months
from the night of the murder to the
day of the trial in which to memorize
them. I'll take the testimony of the
policeman who interrogated him right
after the murder, when he couldn't
remember a thing about the movies,
great emotional stress or not.

, 8TH JUROR
I'd like to ask you a personal
question.
4TH JUROR
Go ahead.
8TH JUROR
Where were you last night?
4TH JUROR
I was home.
8TH JUROR

What. about the night before last?

10TH JUROR
Come on, what is this?

4TH JUROR
(to 10th Juror)
It's perfectly all right.
(to 8th Juror)
I went from court to my office and
stayed there till eight-thirty. Then
I went straight home to bed.

8TH JUROR
And the night before that?
4TH JUROR
That was -- Tuesday. I -- was -- oh,

yes. That was the night of the
bridge tournament. I played bridge.

Monday night my wife and I went to

The Scarlet Circle: It's a very
clever who-done-it.

8TH JUROR
What was the second feature?

4TH JUROR

Bainbridge. The Remarkable Mrs.
Bainbridge.

2ND JUROR

Excuse me. I saw that.. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

4TH JUROR
The -- Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge. Yes.
I think that's right.

Who was in The Amazing Mrs.
Bainbridge?

Barbara -- Long, I think. She's a
dark, very pretty girl. Barbara --
Lang -- Land -- something like that.

The 4th Juror takes a handkerchief and mops his suddenly sweating
forehead.

4TH JUROR
Well, I’d never heard of them before.
It was a very inexpensive second
feature, with unknown...

8TH JUROR
And you weren't under an emotional

strain, were you?

4TH JUROR
No, I wasn’t.
9TH JUROR
I think the point is made.
10TH JUROR
Big point! :
9TH JUROR

I think it is a big point?

10TH JUROR
What? Just.because he can't remember

the name of some two-bit movie star?
I suppose that proves the kid was at
the movies.

9TH JUROR
No. But it indicates that no one can

prove he wasn’t. He might have been
at the movies and forgotten what he
saw. It’s possible. If it‘s
perfectly normal for this gentleman--

(he indicates the 4th Juror)
to forget a few details, then it’s
also perfectly normal for the boy.
Being accused of murder isn’t
necessarly supposed to give him an
infallible memory.

drops?

2ND JUROR
They’re all gone, my friend.

FOREMAN
Y'know, there’s something we're
forgetting here that I was just
thinking about. Well, that’s the
whole business that dragged out
forever, y'know with the
psychiatrist, where he got all
involved...

10TH JUROR
Now don’t start with all that phony

psycho-what-ever-you-call-it stuff.
What a racket that is! Filling
people’s heads with all that junk.
Listen, I’ve got three psychiatrists
keeping their cars in one of my
garages. The whole three of ‘em are
crazy.

FOREMAN
Listen, there’s a point I’m tryin’ to
make here. Do you mind?

10TH JUROR
I wouldn’t give you a nickel for a

psychiatrist’s testimony.

8TH JUROR
Why don’t you let the man talk? You

can take five minutes on the
uselessness of psychiatry when he’s
finished.
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

89

FOREMAN
What I was gonna say was, the

psychiatrist definitely stated that
the boy had strong homicidal
tendencies. I mean, that he was,
what d’ya call it -- capable of
committing murder. He described all
those tests, inkblots and all that
stuff, and he said the kid is
definitely a killer-type. Am I
right?

12TH JUROR
Check. I think he said something

about paranoid tendencies if I’m not
mistaken.

FOREMAN
Right. Whatever that is, he said it.

Let's not forget, we’re talking about
a. boy who’s always had murder on his
mind.

12TH JUROR
His unconscious mind.

. FOREMAN
Nobody else's.

11TH JUROR
I beg pardon, in discussing...

10TH JUROR
I beg pardon. What are you so

goddamn polite about?

11TH JUROR
For the same reason you’re not. It’s

the way I was brought up.

(he turns to the others)
In discussing such a thing as the
murder potential we should remember
that many of us are capable of
committing murder. But few of us do.
We impose controls upon ourselves to
prevent it. The most these
psychiatric tests can accomplish
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96

He stops. The

90

11TH JUROR (CONT)
along these lines is this: They can

tell us that some day a particular
person may commit a murder. That’s
all. They prove nothing.

4TH JUROR
Then how come they're admitted in
evidence?

11TH JUROR

They have many uses, of course. In
this case they added to the general
impression the prosecution was trying
to create. Perhaps we would find
that if we twelve men took the same
tests, one or two of us might be
discovered to have.unconscious
desires to kill, and the potentiality
of carrying them out. Yet none of us
has. To say that a man is capable of
murder does not mean that he has
committed murder.

10TH JUROR
But it can mean it. Listen, if they

said the kid is capable of killing,
he could’ve killed, couldn’t he?

8TH JUROR
You're the one who said, and I quote,

“I wouldn’t give you a nickel for a
psychiatrist’s testimony.

10TH JUROR
Boy, I’m telling you --

I'd like to...

8th Juror does not look up at him. The 10th Juror

12TH JUROR

2ND JUROR
Um -- there’s something I’d like to

say. I mean, it’s been bothering me
a little and as long as we're

stuck Well, there was this whole
busin about the stab wound and how
it was made, the downward angle of
it, you know?

 

3RD JUROR
Don’t tell me we’re gonna start with

that. They went over it and over it.

2ND JUROR
I know they did, but I don’t go along

with it. The boy is five feet, seven
inches tall. His father was six-two.
That's a difference of seven inches.
It’s a very awkward thing to stab
down into. the chest of someone who's
more than a half a foot taller than
you are.

The 2nd Juror hands the knife to the 3rd Juror.

3RD JUROR (CONT)
Look you’re not gonna be satisfied

till you see it again. I’m gonna give
you a:demonstration. Somebody get
up.

There is a pause. No one moves for a moment, and then the 8th
Juror rises and crosses to the 3rd Juror. They stand looking at
each other. .

3RD. JUROR (CONT)

Okay.

(to the 2nd Juror)
Now, watch this. I don’t want to
‘have to do it. again.

(he turns to the 8th Juror,

looks squarely at him, and

squats to make himself shorter)
I'm six or seven inches shorter than
you. Right?

2ND JUROR
That’s right. Maybe a little more.

3RD JUROR
Okay. Let it be more.

He flicks open the knife, changes its position in his hand and
holds it aloft, ready to stab downwards.

The 8th Juror and the 3rd Juror look steadily at each other, then
the 3rd Juror suddenly stabs downward, hard.

2ND JUROR
Look out!

The blade stops about an inch from the 8th Juror’s chest. The 8th
Juror does not move. The 3rd Juror smiles.

6TH: JUROR
That's not funny.

3RD. JUROR
Now just calm down. Nobody’s hurt.

Right?

8TH JUROR
No. Nobody’s hurt.

3RD JUROR
All right. There's your angle. Take

a look at it. Down and in. That's
how I'd stab a taller man in the
chest and that’s how it was done.
Now go ahead and tell me I’m wrong.

The 3rd Juror hands the knife to the 8th Juror and crosses away.
The 12th Juror crosses to the 8th Juror and using his closed hand,
simulates stabbing the 8th Juror in the chest.

12TH JUROR
Down and in. I guess there’s no
argument.

5TH JUROR

(moving to the 8th Juror)
Wait a minute. Give me that.

The 8th Juror hands the knife to the 5th Juror. He closes the
knife and holds it gingerly.

5TH JUROR (CONT)
I hate these things. I grew up with

them.

8TH JUROR
Have you seen them used in fights?

. 5TH JUROR
Too many of them. On my stoop. In my

backyard. In the lot across the
street. Switch knives came with the
neighborhood where I lived. Funny, I
wasn’t thinking of it. I guess you
try to forget those things. You
can’t use this kind of knife that
way. You have to hold it like this
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96 94

5TH JUROR (CONT)
to release the blade. In order to

stab downwards, you would have to
change your grip.

8TH JUROR
How do you use it?

5TH JUROR
Underhanded.

He flicks the knife open and holding it underhanded, swings round
and slashes swiftly forward and upward.

5TH JUROR (CONT)
Like that. Anyone who's ever used a

switch knife’d never handle it any
other way.

8TH JUROR
Are you sure?

5TH JUROR
I’m sure.

(He closes the blade and flicks
it open again)
That’s why they’re made like this.

8TH JUROR
Everyone agreed that the boy is

pretty handy with a knife, didn’t
they?

5TH JUROR
That’s right.

8TH JUROR
(to the 5th Juror)

Do you think he would have made the
kind of wound that killed his father?

5TH JUROR
Not with the experience he’d had with

these things. No, I don’t think he
would. He’d go for him
underhanded...
FIRST DRAFT - 2/14/96 95

3RD JUROR
How do you know? What -- were you in

the room when the father was killed?

5TH JUROR
No, and neither was anyone else.

He sticks the knife in the table and crosses away.

3RD JUROR
- (to the 8th Juror)

You're giving us a lot of mumbo-jumbo
here. I don’t believe it.

4TH JUROR
I don’t think you can determine what

type of wound this boy might or might
not have made simply because he knows
how to handle a knife.

3RD JUROR
That‘s right.  That’s absolutely
right.

8TH JUROR

(looking at the 12th juror)
What do you think?

The 12th Juror hesitates for a moment. He is confused, but trying
to be honest.

12TH JUROR
Well -- I don’t know...

3RD JUROR
What d’ya mean -- you don’t know?

12TH JUROR
I don’t know.

8TH JUROR

You heard me. I’ve had enough.

Hey, listen, you! Just worry about

11TH JUROR

(crossing to the 7th Juror)
He’s right. That is not an answer.

I can talk like that to you. If you

want to vote not guilty, then do it
because you’re convinced the man is
not guilty -- not because you’ve had
enough. And if you think he’s guilty
then vote that way. Or don’t you
have the guts to do what you think is
right?

7TH JUROR
Now, listen...

Guilty or not guilty?

You do have to. Say it. Why?

You at the window, you're so god-

five times as fast as we are. That’s

destroy us. That's right.

Don't look at me like that! There’s

The 4th and 10th Jurors stare at each other. Finally, the 10th
Juror turns away, crosses to a chair and sits his back to the
others. The other Jurors slowly cross to their seats.

8TH JUROR
It’s very hard to keep personal

prejudice out of a thing like this.
And no matter where you run into it,
prejudice obscures the truth. Well,
I don’t think any real damage has
been done here. Because I don’t
really know what the truth is. No one
ever will, I suppose. Nine of us now
seem to feel that the defendant is
innocent, but we're just gambling on
probabilities. We may be wrong. We
may be trying to return a guilty man
to the community. No one can really
know. But we have a reasonable
doubt, and this is a safeguard which
has enormous value in our system. No
jury can declare a man guilty unless
it’s sure. We nine can’t understand
how you three are still so sure.
Maybe you can tell us.

4TH JUROR
I’ll try.. You’ve made some excellent

points. The last one, in which you
“proved” that the boy couldn’t have
made the kind of overhand stab would
that killed his father, was very
persuasive. But I still believe the
boy is guilty of murder. I have two
reasons. One: the evidence given by
the woman across the street who
actually saw the murder committed.

3RD JUROR
And how, brother! As far as I’m

concerned that’s the most important
testimony .in the whole case.

4TH JUROR
And two: the fact that this woman

described the stabbing by saying she
saw the boy raise his arm over his

head and plunge the knife down. into
his father’s chest. She saw him do

it -- the wrong way.

3RD JUROR
That’s right! That’s absolutely
right!

4TH JUROR

Now, let’s talk about this woman for
a minute. She said that she went to
bed at about eleven o’clock that
night. Her bed was next to the
window -- and she could look out
while lying down and see directly
into the boy’s window across the
street. ‘She tossed and turned for
over an hour, unable to fall asleep.
Finally, she turned towards the
window at about ten minutes after
twelve, and, as she looked out, she
saw the killing through the windows

that the lights went out immediately
after the killing but that she got a
good look at the boy in the act of
stabbing his father. As far as I can
see, this is unshakable testimony.

3RD JUROR
That’s what I mean. That's the whole

case.

4TH JUROR

What do you think?

The 8th Juror remains silent. The 4th Juror looks at the 12th

Juror.

How about you?

Well -- I don’t know. There’s so
much evidence to sift. This isa
pretty complicated business.

4TH JUROR
Frankly I don’t see how we can vote

for acquittal.

12 JUROR
Well, it’s not easy to arrange the

evidence in order.

3RD JUROR
You can throw out all the other

evidence. The woman saw him do it.
What else. do you want?

Okay. Now here’s what I think. I

The time is...

He squints and puts on his spectacles.

3RD JUROR
Quarter after six.

4TH JUROR
(looking at clock)

- Quarter after six.

He removes his spectacles and lays themon the table. He looks
tired. He closes his eyes and clasps his fingers over the marks
left by his spectacles at the sides of his nose. He rubs these
areas as he speaks.

I don’t know. I’m guessing. I’m

didn’t put on her glasses when she
turned and looked casually out of the
window. And she herself said that
the murder took place just ass he
looked out, and the lights went off a
split second later. She couldn’t
have had time to put glasses on then.
