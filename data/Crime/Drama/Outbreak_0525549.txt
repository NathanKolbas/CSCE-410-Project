OUTBREAK

FADE IN:

EXT. JUNGLE

HIGH-PITCHED WHINES. LOUDER AND LOUDER. MORTARS race
through the air and EXPLODE in the distant jungle. Sol-
diers -- black, white, Oriental -- curse and mutter in
French, German, Australian and American as they reload.

COMPUTER KEYS POUND -- the letters leap across the screen:

THE MOTABA RIVER VALLEY, BELGIAN CONGO (ZAIRE), 1960.
THE CAMP OF FORCES LOYAL TO MOISES TSHOMBE - DAY

BLACK MALE NURSE

carrying a bucket of water from the Motaba River rushes
past the Mercenary Army to --

CAMP INFIRMARY

Where he replaces the towel on the forehead of a fever-
ish, delirious AUSTRALIAN MERCENARY with a cold new one.

AUSTRALIAN MERCENARY
Gimme somethin' for the bleedin'
pain. C'mon, mate, help me.

The Mercenary tries to lift himself out of his stretcher.
Can't. He's too weak. His skin is yellow and covered
with blisters that look like chicken pox.

NURSE
(checking the
soldier's temp)
He's still over a hundred and
six. Why can't we bring it down?

The black African army physician, DR. RASWANI, looks on,
helpless. Suddenly, the Australian emits a sharp cry.
His eyes roll back, and he begins convulsing. Before
Raswani can even reach into his bag for medecine, the
Mercenary is dead.

Raswani and his Nurse stare with horror.

The DRONE of a CHOPPER grows LOUDER as a Bell Z180 ap-
pears over the edge of the forest and kicks up a storm of
dust as it lands. Raswani and the Nurse run to meet it.
In their eyes, hope.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

Two space-suited figures emerge from the chopper, their
faces hidden by thick green plexiglass shields. The U.S.
flag is emblazoned on the side of their helmets, which
also display their ranks. The much taller man is a
lieutenant whom we'll know as McCLINTOCK. Through his
visor, we can just make out his pock-marked, angular
face. The shorter, pear-shaped man is a CAPTAIN. We
can't see his features, only the reflection of horn-
rimmed glasses.

RASWANI
Have you brought the medicines?
CAPTAIN
Soon.
RASWANI
Why the hell didn't you bring
them?

Cut TO:

INFIRMARY

The two space-suited figures follow Dr. Raswani past
soldier after soldier infected with the same disease.

RASWANI
Thirty deaths yesterday, eighteen
the day before, the disease is
killing our men faster than enemy
bullets.

The Captain stops at a young AMERICAN MERCENARY'S cot.
He's shaking with fever. His skin is mottled and looks
like the pulp of an orange. His voice is a whisper:

AMERICAN MERCENARY
Take me home, Captain... Get me
outta this shithole. Please, I
wanna see my girl.

The American Mercenary reaches out with his arms to the
Captain, who shrinks back, not wanting to be
contaminated.

CAPTAIN
We'll get you home, soldier.
First, I need a tissue sample.

He pulls from his black bag a long metal syringe and
plunges the biopsy needle deep into the man's liver. He
places the needle in an aluminum test tube and seals it.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

AMERICAN MERCENARY
Promise me you'll get me home.
Promise me, Goddamit!

A long uneasy beat.

CAPTAIN
We'll get you home.

Cut TO:

TWO SPACE-SUITED U.S. ARMY FIGURES

boarding their chopper, Dr. Raswani and his Nurse
standing by.

RASWANI
Not just supplies, but doctors
and nurses. And suits like yours
to protect us. This disease
spreads too fast.

CAPTAIN
The plane tonight will bring
everything.

Cut TO:

INSIDE CHOPPER
ascending above the camp.

Lt. McClintock and the Captain look out the window at the
campsite.

McCLINTOCK
It's viral. There's no way to
stop it. It could spread all
over the world.

We can't see the Captain's face, but feel his remorse.
So can McClintock:

McCLINTOCK
If you'll excuse my bluntness,
sir, you can't go halfway on this
one.

CAPTAIN
Don't ever -- ever -- tell me
what I have to do.

Cut TO:
TSHOMBE CAMPSITE —- DUSK

Dr. Raswani gives a shot to the American Mercenary, who
looks terminal.

DR. RASWANI
This will help the pain.

The Male Nurse rushes up.

MALE NURSE
They're coming.

AMERICAN MERCENARY
I knew... they'd come back... I
knew. Help me up. Help me --

Cut TO:

RASWANI

ThE Male Nurse, and dozens of soldiers rush across the
forest to the makeshift runway beside the camp. In the
distance a camouflaged DC-3 is rapidly approaching.

INT. DC-3

The PILOT, no more than 21, sees the soldiers celebrating
their arrival down on the runway. His hand is on the

green bomb release lever.

PILOT
I can't.

McClintock is in the copilot's seat.

McCLINTOCK
It's either them or us.

He puts his hand on the green release lever. Hesitates.
PILOT
You can't either.
ON GROUND

Dr. Raswani and the soldiers stare at the plane, coming
in too high for a landing.

INSIDE PLANE
McClintock squeezes the green lever.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

The bomb cannisters under the wing open up, releasing a
thick cloud of yellow cyanide gas.

ON GROUND

Screams of agony rip out as Raswani and the soldiers
convulse and die.

The plane shoots over the treetops, spraying the ground
below like a crop duster.

Then the plane arcs and approaches again.

OVER RUNWAY

littered with the dead, the plane releases a waxy grey
cloud. One second. Two seconds. An eerie stillness.

The CLOUD EXPLODES in a huge inferno.

The plane releases more and more napalm, burning the
jungle for miles.

The CRIES of ANIMALS caught in the fire pierce the night.
Flames shoot up trees a hundred feet high.

PULL BACK to show the whole forest ablaze. A long beat,
then at the very LEFT CORNER OF the FRAME, a MONKEY with
a black and white coat (a Colobos monkey) emerges from
the fire, looks back at its mate, threatened by the
flames. The Colobos jumps up and down, baring its teeth,
SCREAMING. The fire moves relentlessly forward. The
monkeys dart to safety.

Cut TO:

MOTABA RIVER VALLEY - NEXT MORNING

A metal syringe burned to a molten shard lies beside a
mortar launcher, twisted and deformed like some bizarre
modern sculpture. PULL BACK to reveal acre after acre,
mile after mile of nothing but ashes and carcasses of
burnt-out trees. Not a single living thing remains.

FADE OUT and ROLL CREDITS.

FADE UP:
TREETOPS

A wind rippling through treetops.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

COMPUTER KEYS POUND: "THE MOTABA RIVER VALLEY, AUGUST
12, 1994."

SHOCK CUT TO:

ABOVE RAINFOREST

Brilliant streams of orange and purple, the last rays of
the setting sun, dance across the sky and penetrate the
vapor cloud above the rain forest. Unworldly silence.
Shattered by:

Giant TREES CRASHING to the ground. TRACTORS ROAR,
CHAINSAWS REV with a penetrating whine. Huge trees
living undisturbed for hundreds of years topple to earth,
their roots ripped from the soil.

REVEAL the army of construction workers clearing a path
for the new road linking Kinshasa with Bangui. White
foremen bellow orders in French at their black workers,
including:

MORAZU: a seven-foot tall Goliath with mischievous eyes.
He PUNCHES on his CHAIN SAW and RIPS into another tree.
A cloud of wood dust envelops him.

OVERHEAD - ZAIREAN ARMY HELICOPTERS

ROAR by overhead, their machine gunners searching for
guerilla activity.

INTERCUT - TWO COLOBOS MONKEYS

a mother and her daughter, whom we'll know as Betsy.
Betsy plays with a fat, round jackfruit, kicking it and
rolling it every which way. Her mother watches the
construction workers warily.

Morazu hums as he pulls a huge tree limb off the road and
into a thick patch of brush where he comes face to face
with Betsy. Morazu smiles. He takes a long piece of
sweetened bread from his pocket and lays it down right in
front of the young monkey.

Betsy eyes it warily.
MORAZU
(softly)
Take it.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

A long beat. Betsy takes the bread, examines it careful-
ly, finally takes a bite.

Morazu grabs her. BETSY struggles, thrashing and SCREAM-
ING. Morazu pins her hands behind her back. She spins
around and sinks her teeth into his finger.

He lets go with a shriek and swears at Betsy, who disap-
pears with the bread.

STAY WITH Morazu as he returns to his work. He sucks the
blood out of the small wound.

Cut TO:

EXT. MOTABA RIVA VALLEY (AUGUST 15)

Morazu gets off a bus by a small muddy river and walks
slowly toward his village of about fifty mud-thatched
huts. Pain in his back makes him wince. We see him UP
CLOSE: his eyes are red and his skin is pale. He's
sweating.

He stops at the village well and takes a drink. Other
villagers come up to say hello, and Morazu greets them
wearily, dipping his cup back in the water for another
drink. The villagers drink too.

DISCOVER in the background: the tribal medicine man, the
"ju-ju man." Streaks and circles of paint cover his
skin. He watches the excitement surrounding Morazu's
return.

Cut TO:

RAIN FOREST - LATER THAT NIGHT

A small group of Colobos monkeys including Betsy and her
mother run swiftly through the forest. Suddenly, BETSY
CRIES OUT. Her foot is snagged in a trap. Before her
mother can respond, she's pulled high into the air into a
bamboo cage. The DOOR SNAPS SHUT. BETSY SCREAMS in fear
and pain, hanging upside down --

Cut TO:

SAME - FOLLOWING MORNING

The Colobos monkeys scatter as VOICES APPROACH, REVEALING
two TRIBESMEN pulling a small wagon. The men chatter as
they lower the cage holding Betsy onto the cart.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

FADE UP LUCIANO PAVAROTTI singing a love song from
“La Boheme" and...

Cut TO:

CLOSE ON HUMAN SKULL

wearing Porsche sunglasses and an Army Colonel's hat.
COMPUTER KEYS POUND: "Frederick, Maryland, August 19."

INT. GILLESPIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

FADE UP the VOICE of a MAN SINGING along with the GREAT
TENOR. CONTINUE PANNING OVER the room: the skull gives
way to a full skeleton wearing a star-spangled red-white-
and-blue bow-tie and carrying an umbrella over its fore-
arm. CONTINUE PAST the oak rolltop desk.

MIKE GILLESPIE, about 40, keeps singing as he reads
through a lengthy typed report, making notes in the
margin.

LUCIANO hits a high C. Gillespie reaches for it... and
misses badly. DOGS WHINE O.S., probably in closer
harmony to Luciano than Gillespie. He's not pleased.

GILLESPIE
I rescue you from certain death
and instead of gratitude, you mock
me.

His two WOLFHOUNDS, Olser and Harvey, GROVEL on the floor
contritely, each with a worn shoe in his mouth. Behind
them we see the rest of Gillespie's living/dining room.
His townhouse is spartan; it needs a woman's touch. Un-
packed boxes stand in the corner beside a treadmill.
GILLESPIE

That can't go unpunished. No

Letterman for three nights.
The dogs wag the running shoes.

Cut TO:

OLD CREEK PARK (FREDERICK, MARYLAND) - NIGHT

Gillespie, puffing, a weekend runner, strains to keep up
with the DOGS. They BARK excitedly.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

GILLESPIE
(reaching into his
pockets)
Okay! Okay!

Without breaking stride, he throws what look like sticks
high into the air. The dogs jump and catch the objects in
their mouths and race back to Gillipsie.

We see they're old stethoscopes with thick rubber tubing.
Gillespie lets them fly again. He laughs at their eager-
ness and keeps running, sprinting now, trying to prove to
himself that he's still young. Suddenly -- a PHONE RINGS.
Without breaking stride, he pulls a cellular phone from
his pocket:

GILLESPIE
(into phone)
Dr. Gillespie... How many dead?...

INT. BILLY FORD'S OFFICE (FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND)

Gillespie's boss, GENERAL BILLY FORD, MD, is a heavy-set
man in his early 60's with thinning hair, piercing, in-
telligent grey eyes and a warm smile. Scattered all
around his office are cages filled with frogs and rep-
tiles. As he talks on the phone, he's feeding a green-
horned toad some dead flies.

FORD
Almost an entire village.

INTERCUT WITH:

FORD WITH GILLESPIE
still running.

GILLESPIE
Is is Lassa Fever? Ebola? What?

FORD
How the hell do I know? I'm the
bureaucrat, you're the detective,
remember? All I know is State
wants us to lend a hand and when
the Secretary talks, I listen.
And when I talk, you listen.
You're Code Red. The plane's
leaving at 01:30.

(CONTINUED )
10.
CONTINUED:

GILLESPIE
Yes, sir.

Gillespie hangs up, out of breath... excited.

Cut TO:

EXT. GILLESPIE'S OLD BMW - LATER THAT NIGHT

Gillespie and the dogs pull into the driveway of a comfor-
table two story colonial home, passing a "For Sale" sign
on the front lawn pasted with a "Sold" sticker.

EXT. COLONIAL HOME
Gillespie knocks. The DOGS BARK excitedly.

WOMAN (0.S.)
Who is it?

The dogs recognize the voice and jump against the door.

GILLESPIE
Mike.

ROBERTA "ROBBY" KEOUGH, an attractive, intelligent woman
in her mid 30's, opens the door a few inches, until the
latch LOCK CHAIN SNAPS tight. The dogs try to push
inside.

ROBBY
(smiles; delighted)
Hey, guys!

But when she looks at Gillespie, she's guarded.

GILLESPIE
Robby, I know I'm the last guy
you'd do a favor for, but I've got
no one else to ask.

ROBBY
My lawyer said not to talk to you
anymore.

GILLESPIE
Then just listen. I gotta go to
Zaire.

Robby shakes her head, "No, no way."

(CONTINUED )
11.
CONTINUED:

ROBBY
Put 'em in a kennel.

GILLESPIE
So they can die of some weird
disease like Stripes did?

She mouths the word "no."

GILLESPIE
-- Look, Robby, if I had any other
choice, I wouldn't be here.

ROBBY
You should've let me have them.
You can't take care of them.

Beat. Robby's torn. The dogs nuzzle against her leg.

GILLESPIE
I won't be gone long.

ROBBY
You know I'm moving to Atlanta --
they want me to start in four days.

GILLESPIE
I'll be back before that.
ROBBY
(sharply)
Four days is four weeks -- to you.
Silence.
GILLESPIE
It wasn't all my fault, Robby.
ROBBY
(quietly)
I know.
A long beat.
ROBBY

I'll look after them on one

condition: if you're not back in

four days, they're mine.
Gillespie doesn't like it.

GILLESPIE
Okay.

(CONTINUED )
12.
CONTINUED:

ROBBY
In writing.

She unlatches the door and moves inside. The dogs race
after her. Gillespie enters...

FRONT HALL

overflowing with moving boxes, some sealed, others waiting
to be packed. Gillespie feels awkward, a stranger in his
own home.

She hands him a prescription pad. He crosses off her
nameplate, "Roberta Keough, MD," and starts writing
while Robby enters...

KITCHEN

ROBBY
Hey, guys, c'mon!

They follow her in.

ROBBY
Guess what I got?

The DOGS BARK excitedly.

ROBBY
Damn straight!

She opens the freezer, grabs a couple of frozen bagels and
flips them to the DOGS. They catch the bagels and start
CHOMPING.

ROBBY
I missed you guys so much.

Gillespie hands her the note.

ROBBY

(reading it)
'I, Michael Gillespie, agree that
if I'm not back in exactly four
days from now, the ownership of my
dogs, Osler and Harvey, will go
to Roberta Keough.'

(handing it back)
Time and date it.

He does. She points to a huge box on the kitchen
table:

(CONTINUED )
13.
CONTINUED:

ROBBY
That's stuff from med school...
Some of it's yours. I don't know
if you want any of it.

He fishes through it, shoving aside old medical books
and equipment. He finds an old wood stethoscope with
thick rubber tubing. He shoves in into his pocket.

GILLESPIE
Got a place yet?

ROBBY
An apartment.

GILLESPIE

The first thing you'll do is spend
the whole night unpacking...
You'll stay up 'til dawn but
you'll get everything in its
place.

ROBBY
(smiles)
Probably.

GILLESPIE
Nothin' in my life has been
organized since you left, Robby.

Beat. She's surprised at his admission. And un-
comfortable. So's he. He continues searching through
the box and pulls out...

A photo taken during their honeymoon cruise: they're
both smiling radiantly as they hold between them a
trophy of a dancing couple.

GILLESPIE
Y'know, this is the only evidence
on Earth that I was ever graceful.

He checks her reaction. There is a hint of a smile.

ROBBY
Take it.
GILLESPIE
Nah, people might see it... get

the wrong impression.

He drops the photo back in the box and moves toward
the door.

(CONTINUED )
14.
CONTINUED:

ROBBY
Four days.

GILLESPIE
Or less.

As we hear the front DOOR OPEN and SHUT, HOLD ON
Robby: a hint of regret.

Cut TO:

ANDREWS AIR BASE, MARYLAND
COMPUTER KEYS POUNDING: "Andrews Air Base, Maryland."

Flood lights illuminate a huge C5A transport plane
waiting on the runway, its nose cocked open exposing
its innards to the pouring rain. Several enlisted
men rapidly wheel equipment into the open hatch. A
private pushes a dolly loaded with boxes with the red
cross emblem up the ramp.

DR. ISAAC "IZZY" BERMAN, a short, bald Army Major in
his late 30's directs traffic.

IZZY
Blood in the freezer over the
right wing. C'mon! Gut it!
We're late.

The private grunts and pushes the dolly slowly up the
ramp. Izzy lends a hand, and the two of them run it up
the ramp.

Mike Gillespie, dressed in a uniform, climbs down from
the cockpit. Now we see his rank: Colonel.

GILLESPIE
Where the hell's Yaffe?
IZZY
His wife... she's due tomorrow.

I put him on leave.

GILLESPIE
We need him now! Who's going to
read the electron micrographs?

IZZY
I will.

CONTINUED:

15.

GILLESPIE
You can't even read a Playboy
pinup.

IZZY

He said he'd get a guy to fill in.

GILLESPIE
We can't wait.

A Jeep drives across the tarmac, toward them and comes

to a park

a short distance away. The Driver scurries

out to open the passenger door to let --

General Ford get out.

IZZY
What does he want?

The driver pulls two suitcases out of the Jeep and
follows Ford into the plane.

FORD
I'm comin' along, Mike.

GILLESPIE
Sir, we're going into very
dangerous territory.

FORD
I'm well aware of the dangers.

GILLESPIE
Beggin' your pardon, General, I
don't think you are. You've had
only the most cursory training
on how to avoid contamination.
Concerns for your safety would
distract us.

FORD
Nothing distracts you, Colonel.
You won't even know I'm there.

GILLESPIE
Sir, I'm not comfortable --

FORD
Mike, have a little compassion for
an old man who's been rotting
behind a desk.

FORD (CONT'D)
For once I'd like to be there
when one of these buggers hits.
You're not going to tell me I
can't go, Colonel, are you?

GILLESPIE
No, sir.
FORD
Good. I feel wanted, now.

I get airsick in the back. I'll
be up with the pilot.

DOWN BELOW
Gillespie pulls a lever and the hatch starts to close.

IZZY
Wait!

Mike follows his eyes out to the --

TARMAC

where a BLACK MAN carrying a duffel bag is sprinting
toward them at incredible speed, like a ghost through
the pelting rain.

Berman swings the lever down and the hatch starts to
open but the Man doesn't wait for it to lower
completely. Without breaking stride, he leaps the
four feet onto the plane and slides to a stop right
in front of Gillespie. He steadies himself and
salutes:

SALT (BLACK MAN)
Captain Walter Salt reporting, sir.

Izzy smiles. He looks at Gillespie, who is impressed
but won't show it.

SALT
I'm sorry to be late, sir. I was
wrapping up some tests in my lab --

GILLESPIE
-- Strap in.

The huge JET ENGINES come to life. Gillespie, Berman,
and Salt strap themselves into the row of jump seats
along the fuselage.

Issy is filled with the excitement of a young kid who
can't believe his luck:

IZZY
You're not the football player
from West Point, that Salt?

SALT

IZZY
Don't call me sir. The only one
who does that is the Colonel here.
Everyone else calls me Izzy.

SALT
Izzy, sir?

IZZY
My mother calls me Isaac, but I
hate it. I pitched for my high
school team. My dad thought I
was gonna be another Dizzy Dean.
So he called me 'Izzy.'

SALT
Yes, sir, Izzy, sir.

surges forward and taxis down the runway.

GILLESPIE
I want to know just one thing.
Can you read electron micrographs
as well as you can run?

SALT
I'm not sure how to assess the
question --

IZZY

-- Just say ‘yes, sir,' Captain.
Whatever the Colonel asks, you
just say ‘yes, sir.' That's how
we keep him under control.

GILLESPIE
Have you ever seen filovirus
infection in a human being?

SALT
No, sir.

GILLESPIE
It's about as pretty as goin'
naked up the middle against the
Dallas Cowboys.

The machine gunner looks up at the U.S. Army insignia

INT. BACK OF CHOPPER

Izzy slips the clear helmet over General Ford's head.
PULL BACK to reveal:

The General covered from head to toe in BL-4 bio-
safety suit. Salt, dressed the same, looks on, amused.

FORD
(panicking)
How do you breath in here?

IZZY
(laughs)
With a respirator. Positive
pressure's what you want. Keep
those buggers out.

Izzy flips the switch on Ford's respirator, which sucks
air out of the atmosphere, filters it, and pumps it
into the suit. Ford starts to swell up like the
Pillsbury doughboy.

FORD
And I thought it was a hassle
wearin' a tie all day.

INT. FRONT OF CHOPPER - A LITTLE LATER

Gillespie, now suited up in full biosafety gear, but
holding his helmet in his hands, sits beside the
CHOPPER PILOT. In the distance, we see a village in
which numerous huts are burning.

GILLESPIE
We got a lot of equipment.
You're gonna have to get us in

close.

PILOT
I... I don't want to get no
disease, sir.

GILLESPIE

Then don't kiss me, Sergeant.

CHOPPERS

throwing up a storm of dust as they sweep down to the
ground on the perimeter of the village.

INT. CHOPPER

Gillespie, Salt, Berman and Ford stand by the door,
ready to get out as soon as the chopper puts down.
Gillespie has to shout at Salt over the sound of the
WHIRLING CHOPPER BLADES:

GILLESPIE
Captain Salt, if you fail to
observe strict decontamination
protocol, three things can happen.
First, you can be court-martialed.
Second, you can die from this
horrible disease. Third, and
worst of all, you can incur my
displeasure. You got it?

SALT
Yes, sir.

GILLESPIE
If one of us gets sick, we all get
sick.

(turns to Ford)
And I didn't come here to die.

BURNING HUTS - WIDE ANGLE SHOT

juxtaposed against the U.S. Army choppers disgorging
the U.S. Army Infectious Disease Team -- blue space-
suited figures with the U.S. flag emblazoned on their
arms and helmets.

The ju-ju man remains high on the cliff above the
village, chanting and wailing, burning an offering to
the gods.

The U.S. Army Team approaches the village through the
smoky haze, and we see --

Two different worlds juxtaposed -- men in spacesuits
and a man in a loincloth.

Gillespie, followed by Berman, Salt and Ford, moves
across the village which now looks devastated and
deserted except for a few remaining huts and a small
cinder block building with an old Volkswagen van,
marked with a red cross, parked out front.

(CONTINUED )

CONTINUED:

Ford walks slower taking everything in, appalled at
what he sees.

The U.S. Army team enters the cinder block hut.

INT. CINDER BLOCK HUT

A short, slender, bespectacled black man in his late
forties -- DR. IWABI -- head of the Zaire Infectious
Disease Heath Agency -- and his NURSE, protected only
by a smock, a surgical mask, and gloves, gives comfort
to a young woman who's dying.

GILLESPIE
Doctor Iwabi? I brought blood,
plasma --

DR. IWABI

-- You're too late.

GILLESPIE
I came as soon as I could.

DR. IWABI
It wouldn't have mattered when you
came. This one is different --
worse than Lassa, worse even than
Ebola. It strikes and kills so
fast. The young, the healthy,

everybody.
GILLESPIE
Who was the index case?

We don't know. He died three days

The corpse's eyes are yellow and his flesh, speckled
with hemmorrhages, looks like pulp. Blood oozes from
his nose and his nipples. Ford turns away in horror.

SALT

I'm gonna be sick.

He starts to rip off his mask. Gillespie grabs his
arms.

GILLESPIE
Keep you helmet on, Goddamit!

SALT
I can't breath.

Salt vomits in his helmet. Rips it off. He rushes
out. Izzy moves after him.

GILLESPIE
Put him in quarantine. Now!
DR. IWABI
You don't need to.
GILLESPIE
Why?
DR. IWABI

It's not spread in the air.

GILLESPIE
How do you know?

DR. IWABI
(pulls down his mask)
There's no cough. Or we'd all be
dead. For days we've been working
with only these masks. They can't
keep out a particle as small as a
virus.

GILLESPIE
Could any infected person have
gotten out of this village and
spread it?

DR. IWABI
The incubation period is only one
or two days. The mortality is one
hundred percent.

CONTINUED:

DR. IWABI (CONT'D)
If anyone got out, they are dead,
or will be soon. And if they have
spread the disease, we will know
rather quickly.

GILLESPIE
Finding the host is the only way
to control the spread. Our only
hope is that this is like most
viruses and that it has to live in
a host, an animal, to which it's
adapted over thousands of years.
And that animal host has developed
antibodies to protect itself
against the virus. If we can
identify that animal host, and
harvest its antibodies, we can use
them to fight the disease in
humans.

DR. IWABI
There are a hundred thousand
species of animals and insects in
this rain forest. The
construction worker could have
been in contact with any one of
them. Where do I start?

GILLEPSIE
General, tell him that our
government will help with money,
personnel supplies, whatever it
takes.

Ford hesitates.

Of course, we'll do whatever we

can.

The ju-ju man chants. He seems to float above the
funeral pyre like a mirage.

GILLESPIE
What's he saying?

DR. IWABI
He's asking for forgiveness from
the Gods of the forest. They're
angry because they've been awoken
from their sleep by the men
building the road. These deaths
are their punishment.

FORD
Why isn't he sick?

Salt watches with horror. In spite of their BL-4 suits,
you just don't play with these things. Salt checks
Gillespie, expecting the same reaction, but...

He's so excited; he's going to

ROBBY
Dr. Gillespie wants us to send
out a special bulletin warning all

Congo Fever in Nairobi in '87,
and suddenly it's in every
American kid's lunch box --

ROBBY
-- You're not being fair --

In '91 he said Tsutsugamushi
Fever was coming. In '92 it was
Ebola. His panics cost us plenty.
Around here he's known as Doctor
Doom.

ROBBY
He could've been right about any
of them. Rule out the worst

always taught.

DREW REYNOLDS
Your father was one of the
greatest Surgeon Generals this
country ever had. He took me
under his wing and let me fly.
I've always been grateful. And
I've always had a special feeling

for you, Robby. The... pain it
gave him to see you working under
Gillespie... all your promise...

the man never gave you a chance

GILLESPIE

We've got to quarantine the entire

quick. Morning will be too late --
people will panic and try to leave.
If even one infected person gets
out, the entire effort could be

for nothing.

GOODELL
Why can't the State Police do it?

GILLESPIE
They can shut down the major
roads, but we need a much larger
force to encircle the town.

GOODELL
Where would I get troops at this

about this?

GILLESPIE
Yes, sir, of course. He asked me
to call you.

GOODELL
Colonel, all I can do is refer the
matter to the National Security
Council. An action of this scope
would require the President's

approval.

GILLESPIE
Then get it, sir. Right away,
please.

They break radio contact. Salt looks at Gillespie with
awe.

IZZY
If the C.D.C. asked us to help, why
did you have to call the Defense
Secretary? Why didn't General
Ford make the call?

Gillespie shifts uncomfortably. Salt realizes he's in

You bet your ass, Captain.
Colonel Gillespie has taken it

local police, wearing respirators, hold back a crowd of

Robby and Lisa and the state police officers climb out

She tries to go around him. He grabs her arm.

INT. HOSPITAL

Robby, followed by Mike, moves down the corridor.

ROBBY
On whose authority are you here,
Michael?

GILLESPIE

Want me to leave?

She doesn't answer. We hear only the RUSH of AIR in their
SUITS, drowning out the horror we see as they pass room
after room of Motaba patients, screaming and moaning in
pain. They pass...

Izzy in a room with Henry, the lab tech. Lips blue,
gasping for every breath, he fights against the vent-

the fine red vesicular rash of end-stage Motaba. She
pleads with Salt, standing there in a biosafety suit,
completely helpless.

MOTHER
Save my baby... Please... Save my
baby.

Robby exchanges a glance with Gillespie. She's
devastated.

GILLESPIE
I tried to warn you.

But nothing he could have said could have prepared her for
this. She moves on into...

Nurse Emma and Dr. Mascelli, in biosafety suits, pack
Tracy, the movie-counter girl, in ice.

Robby looks at Rudy, lying in the next cubicle, eyes com-

black-and-blue splotches. His chest rises and falls in
short gasps.

GILLESPIE
Bonneville patient zero. He never
regained consciousness so we don't

Robby, who in a second, pops it open, pulls out the
syringe of Valium and shoots the yellow liquid into

Tracy's IV. She stops seizing.
Dr. Mascelli and Nurse Emma are impressed.

ROBBY

the antiserum is still flowing. In the next bed, Corinne,
Henry's girl friend, also lies dead.

McCLINTOCK
The Motaba antiserum doesn't work.

FORD

The virus has changed enough so
that the antibodies can't recognize
it. We've got to find the host,
Donny.

McCLINTOCK

How? The San Jose animals were
all negative.

For thirty years you've thought it
was a breath away. And we looked,

No. Unless Jimbo Scott had close

There's got to be something at

Salt looks plaintively at the Rhesus. He opens the

He's about to close the fridge, but stops and stares...

Inside the refrigerator: a unit of antiserum just lying
around. He looks at the antiserum, then at the monkey,
sick in its cage.

QUARANTINE PERIMETER - DAWN

The line of troops and tanks stretches for miles. HUEYS
THUNDER overhead, keeping watch.

Behind the tanks are a swarm of figures wearing red BL-4

animals toward a huge series of trailers.

INT. GENERAL FORD'S COMMAND CENTER - DAWN

The Command Center is buzzing with activity. Along one
wall is an array of supercomputers all feeding data to...

The big board -- a computerized map of the Quarantine
Area.

DR. FRANKLE, a Biowar Defense expert, an intense, bearded
man of about 50 -- paces in front of the big board. As
Frankle briefs Ford and McClintock, we literally see the
epidemic spreading out from the center of Bonneville --
more and more terrain is colored red each time the big
screen redraws. The red gets larger and larger, until it
comes within three miles of the Columbia River, which cuts
a big blue swath through the map.

FRANKLE
Mosquitoes are picking up this
virus. An hour ago a squirrel
with Motaba was trapped just three
miles from the river.

FORD

(angry)
Increase the spraying, Goddamnit!

FRANKLE
The best stuff we've got won't
kill every last one. Eventually
one bug, one animal's going to get
through to the river. Worst case
is the virus penetrates the
ecosystem. Then we can't stop it.

FORD
There's got to be a way to deal
with it --

FRANKLE
-- The only similar case I know of
is the Influenza Epidemic of 1918.
It circled the globe in two weeks.

Silence.

McCLINTOCK
People can be asymptomatic, for
weeks. The tests are faulty. We
have to assume everyone in this
town is infected and will get this
disease sooner or later.

Silence. Finally:

FORD
I want the most rapid-acting nerve

never know what hit ‘em.

INT. BIO-TEST MAIN OFFICE (SAN JOSE) - DAY

cabinets and ancient PC's. The company President, Felder,
and Lisa Aronson sit near a speakerphone.

LISA ARONSON

SMALL OFFICE IN BACK OF BL-4 LAB

Gillispie, Robby, and Izzy are running out of options as
they converse with Lisa Aronson in San Jose, California,
on the speakerphone:

GILLESPIE
Could Jimbo Scott have deleated all
traces of an animal stored at your
facility?

FELDER (V.O.)
Don't be absurd, he was a good
employee --

GILLESPIE

Mr. Felder, don't take this
personally, but either you're a
horrible judge of character or the
world's in deep shit. Could Jimbo
Scott have erased all records on
an animal stored at your facility?
Yes or no?

Felder hesitates.

Suddenly Gillespie's WALKIE-TALKIE BEEPS:

SALT (V.O.)
Colonel, come quick.

INT. BL-4 LAB

Robby, Mike and Izzy enter the animal lab and stop cold.

The brown rhesus is sitting up in his cage, weak but
eating some lettuce.

SALT
He should be dead.

The last of the antiserum drips into the animal's arm.

SALT
I gave him the antiserum.

IZZY
It doesn't work on people. It
shouldn't work on simians either.

SALT
So how come it worked on this one?

Gillespie's mind is racing:

GILLESPIE
He was infected with the first
strain, before it mutated.

IZZY
It still shouldn't work. This
Korean Filo4 doesn't cross-react

GILLESPIE
Maybe it's not Korean Filo4.

SALT
What else could it be?

Izzy leans against the wall; he's pale, feverish. The
others pay no attention.

IZZY
I need some air.

He takes a step, then starts seizing, his whole body
shaking in one convulsive wave after the next.

Gillespie, Robby and Wally rush over.
SALT

He's slowin' down. He's gonna

Gillespie smiles.

GILLESPIE
You were a hundred and eight. Not

You musta lost a billion brain

IZZY
Now I'm only as smart as you.

Gillespie grins.

Berman tries to smile. His lip twitches... uncontrolla-

GILLESPIE
We need a line.

Robby flips Gillespie a catheter set. He looks for a
vein. Robby and Wally try to keep Izzy flat while
Gillespie works, but...

SLOW MOTION SHOT

Izzy's arm jerks free, pushing Mike's hand and the razor-
sharp needle right at Mike's other hand.

ROBBY
Watch out!

She shoves Mike's hand out of the path, but the needle
nicks her glove.

Mike and Wally are horrified.

Her finger -- we see just the tiniest thin line of
crimson blood.

Terrified, she runs into...

pours iodine into the tiny wound and frantically scrubs,
as if her life depened on it. It does.

She turns at the sound of the DOOR OPENING. It's

You took the hit for me... Why?

Tears fill her eyes. Her mouth opens. She can't talk.
Only a low moan of terror.

He stands up on the hood of an old blue van and screams
at the troops.

TOMMY
That's right. Kill us all. C'mon!

They can't hear him or see him. He finishes the last of
the bottle and climbs into...

from the other side of the hill:

Two Apache helicopters appear.

Hull sticks the AK-47 out the window and FIRES at the

They keep coming.

Red sparks erupt from their bellies. HELLFIRES.

The VAN EXPLODES into tiny pieces.

Gillespie GUNS the JEEP toward the wreckage.

Nobody move!

Gillespie sits down beside the Anchor. He shrinks back

Gillespie studies the map.
GILLESPIE
To get back up there we're gonna

SALT
Luck ain't gonna be enough.

Salt pushes the wheel down, until the Black Hawk is just
a few feet above the tall redwood trees. He veers to
avoid --
A particularly tall redwood -- and misses it by inches,
whacking off a few of its upper branches with the rotor
blades.

McCLINTOCK
Give me an order to fire, sir. We
don't need the monkey.

antiserum. How long did it take
you to do the last one? A year?
Two years? Five?

Ford's torn.

might see us.

She smiles, remembering.
GILLESPIE
I never felt anything except with
you, Robby. I was so stupid to
let it slip away.
She closes her eyes. A cry of anguish:

GILLESPIE
Salt!

Beat. Then Salt appears in the doorway holding a large
plastic bag of Betsy's antiserum.

Gillespie connects it to Robby's IV and the brown fluid
flows into Robby. Gillespie sits down beside her. A
long beat. Then he does:

Something crazy. He removes the glove from his biosafety
suit so that his own bare hand can touch Robby's skin.

He touches her face gently.

HOLD ON Gillespie, sitting beside his wife's bed, holding

Frankle's troubled too:

DR. FRANKLE
He's right.

Ford agonizes.

FORD
To implement the plan and to kill
only a portion of the population...
That would cause great harm and
solve nothing.

McCLINTOCK
Sir!! The nerve gas rapidly loses
its potency after it's mixed. The

The virus will escape and we'll
have to use nuclear weapons to
sterlize the area.

FORD
I gave you my orders.

Beat. Then quietly:

McCLINTOCK
Let's say the antiserum did work,
General. You'd bus out the people,
move ‘em somewhere, and treat 'em.
And with luck some of them would
live. But it's not going to work
and in the meantime you don't
understand what you've done.

FORD
I understand perfectly.

McCLINTOCK
No, you don't. We can't fool the

McClintock has slowly drawn his belt out of his trousers.
He quickly throws it around Ford's neck, crosses it, and
pulls violently on the two ends. Ford kicks and
struggles, but he's no match for McClintock's strength.

McCLINTOCK
I am relieving you of command on
the basis of cowardice in the face
of a national emergency.

Ford's dead. McClintock lays him out on the floor. Opens
the door and screams into the main room.

McCLINTOCK

He starts doing CPR as aides rush in.

forth, its tongue twitching hungrily. It moves past:

The barbed-wire fence emblazoned with the sign warning:
"U.S. MILITARY PROPERTY: TRESPASSING STRICTLY
PROHIBITED."

Behind the fence the duplexes are dark and abandoned.

The gila monster catches a fly and disappears into the
night.

FADE OUT.

THE END
