JERRY&S VOICE:
Tonight we heve in our power
to ask definitely incriminating
questions of these offictalsse.
and the power to demand satis-
factory answers, What really
is the truth in the case of the
racketeer and gunman -» Rocky
Sullivan? Why did the polico
release him so suddenly with all
the evidence they had piled up
against him? Why did the not-
orious Mac Keofer pay Sullivan
$100,000 in cash as ransom, and
what political sword does he
hold over the trembling heads:
of district sttorneys, judges,
end police officials? Why does
the prosecutor's office refuse
to investigate ws. ? But to-
morrow the new Grand Jury will
meet, and these questions must
be answered, Therefore, Task
the public. to pass the follow-
ing resolution addressed to the
Grend Jury: "That we demand an
immediate indictment of Rocky
Sullivan, together with a com-
plete investigation of everyone
connected with this travesty on
justice, and a probing into the
nefarious activitics of all the
ec Kecfers and James Fraziers
in this crime ridden communityl"
