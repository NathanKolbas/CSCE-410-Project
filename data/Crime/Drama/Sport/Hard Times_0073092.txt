SPEED
Gandil's 4 businessman. Always
worried about his reputation.
He's not going to try any muscle
play.

Wait.

SPEED

But there's one thing we got to
live with. Since you beat Jim
Henry you're marked. From now
on we'll have to give the odds.
Fights are going to be hard to
come by. Things are really
going to get expensive. It's
possible we could use Gandil.

CHANEY
No need worrying about it. We're
getting toward the end of things.
