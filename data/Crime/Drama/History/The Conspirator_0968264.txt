MALE VOICE
(over a black screen)
Two men waiting at the Pearly Gates
strike up a conversation.

FADE UP: On FREDERICK AIKEN, 26, a handsome, young turk.

AIKEN/MALE
"How'd you die?" The first man asks
the second.

Aiken is wearing the blue and gold of the Union Army.

AIKEN
"I froze to death," says the second.
"That's awful. What's it like to
freeze to death?"

PULL BACK: to reveal Aiken has been shot in the abdomen,
uniform blood-soaked, slumped inside a cold, muddy BUNKER.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
"You get the shakes and pain in all
your fingers and toes. But eventually
you kind of drift off as if you're
falling asleep.
(a beat)
How 'bout you? How'd you die?"

Revealing Aiken is not alone. Best friend, NICHOLAS BAKER,
27, is nearby - right leg nearly severed above the knee.

AIKEN (CONT'D

"Heart attack," says the first man.

"You see my wife was cheating on me.
So, I show up at home unexpectedly.

I burst into the bedroom. She's all
alone knitting. So, I race down to

the basement to find the louse, but

no one's there. I sprint up to the

attic, and just as I arrive... I had
a massive heart attack and died."

Baker's breathing becomes labored. He is beginning to fade.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
The second man shakes his head.
"That is so ironic!" "what do you
mean?" asks the first. "Well, if
you'd only stopped to look in the
icebox, we'd both be still alive."

Baker manages to turn towards Aiken, rolls his eyes, then
begins to gurgle, choking on his blood.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Hang on, Nick. Help is on its way.

But there's no sign of anyone. Aiken, his own pain evident
starts up again, desperately trying to keep his buddy awake.
AIKEN (CONT'D)
A blind dog walks into a saloon...
(Baker murmurs)
What is it, Nick?

Aiken lowers himself to hear his comrade.

BAKER
Shut up... and I promise to live.

Suddenty, two STRETCHER BEARERS appear. As they begin to
cart Aiken away, he pushes them off. Pointing at Baker --

STRETCHER BEARER #1
But, Colonel, he's as good as dead.

AIKEN
That's an order.

They take Baker away. Aiken begins to fade from loss of
blood. His eyes flicker SHUT, as we --

PULL BACK to a wide shot of a BATTLEFIELD at GETTYSBURG --
littered with the DEAD and WOUNDED.

FADE TO BLACK:
SUPERIMPOSE : BASED ON A TRUE STORY

TOASTMASTER (V.0.)
Hip hip hooray...Hip hip hooray...

FADE UP: INT. CENTURY CLUB - BALLROOM -- LATER

CELEBRANTS
(shouting, in unison)
..Hip hip hooray!!!

Crystal clanking. Corks popping. Behind the TOASTMASTER,
an enormous BANNER: "Victory to the Union"

TWO YEARS LATER

APRIL 14, 1865
WASHINGTON, D.C.

A grand CELEBRATION instantly denoting prestige and influence --
all powerful and all for Union.

BAKER (0.S.)
Is he here, yet?

AIKEN (0.S.)
No. But half his cabinet is.

REVEAL: FREDERICK AIKEN, now 28, aged a bit by events, joined
again by NICHOLAS BAKER, now minus his leg. Another hotshot,
WILLIAM HAMILTON, is present too. They've all had a few.

Aiken scans faces. Notes players. POWER BROKERS abound.
AIKEN
There's Interior...the Postmaster...

INSERT: GRAYBEARDS, as Aiken identifies the members of
LINCOLN'S CABINET, Like positions around an infield.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Treasury...Navy...and War

BAKER
Secretary Stanton, where?

 

Aiken points to EDWIN STANTON, 50, imperious, chest length
beard, eyes concealed behind tiny, gold-rimmed glasses.

BAKER (CONT'D)
I'd give my eye-teeth to meet him.

Aiken begins to beeline towards Stanton, then stops.

AIKEN
Aren't you coming?

BAKER
Just like that?

HAMILTON

Are you mad? You can't approach
Edwin Stanton without an introduction.

AIKEN
Watch how it's done. Unless, you'd
prefer to meet him too?

Baker nods. Aiken moves to help his one-legged friend.

BAKER
I can do it myself.

AIKEN
Like hell, you couldn't walk straight
with two.

A BOOMING VOICE catches Aiken from behind.

BOOMING VOICE (0.S.)
Mr. Aiken, I've been to creation and
back looking for you.

Aiken turns toward a familiar voice.

AIKEN
Baker, Hamilton... May I introduce
the distinguished Senator from
Maryland -- Mr. Reverdy Johnson.

REVEAL: REVERDY JOHNSON, early 50's, a thorn in anyone's
side. Blind in his left eye. Very southern.

HAMILTON
A great honor, Senator
BAKER
(slurred from drinking)
May I say, sir...you were our first
I mean, our finest Attorney General.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Honor's mine, gentlemen. You've
done this nation proud. Glad to see
y'all are enjoyin' this evenin'.

Reverdy Johnson winks at Baker with his good eye.

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Country needs you boys more than
ever to put it back together.

Reverdy Johnson spots several GRAYBEARDS passing by.

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Gentlemen, would you excuse us a
moment? They're some folks I reckon'
my new associate ought to meet.

The Senator leads Aiken away. Hamilton watches with envy.

HAMILTON
I reckon Fred has to if he's to be
considered seriously.

BAKER
Yes, Hamilton, some of us do have to
work for a living...

INT. CENTURY CLUB - JEFFERSON ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Reverdy ushers Aiken inside the club's inner sanctum lined
with PORTRAITS of its past luminaries JEFFERSON, MADISON...

; AIKEN
Quite a turnout.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Victory is like shit to flies,
Freddie. One whiff is all it takes.

sarcastically) .
Mr. Secretary, such a delightful
surprise.

REVEAL: EDWIN STANTON puffing furiously on a FAT CIGAR.

SECRETARY OF WAR
Life's full of â€˜em, Senator

REVERDY JOHNSON
Frederick Aiken. Of course, you're
familiar with our venerable War
Secretary, Edwin Stanton.

AIKEN
Yes, of course. It's a great
pleasure, sir.
SECRETARY STANTON
I understand you took two bullets at
Gettysburg, Colonel, and never quit
the field. The pleasure is mine

Stanton warmly clanks Aiken's champagne glass. Aiken beams.

STANTON

We can always use a loyal man like

you over at the War Department.
REVERDY JOHNSON

My godson works for me now, Ed.

It's time to heal the nation -- not

wage war.

STANTON
Depending on whose side you're on.

REVERDY JOHNSON
One needn't be a Yankee to be for
Union same as you.
STANTON
Well then, I dare say, the enemy is
never far from hand.
An AIDE hands Stanton a NOTE. Stanton reads it.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Is everything alright?

; _ STANTON ;
President Lincoln sends his regrets --
seems Mrs. Lincoln made other plans.
...The SOUND of laughter.
PULL BACK: INT. THEATER - STAGE -- NIGHT
As TWO ACTORS perform the farce, "Our American Cousin." One
is dressed as a Victorian DANDY; the other, as an eccentric
BACKWOODSMAN. The setting is an English drawing room.
...The SOURCE of laughter
PULL BACK: INT. THEATER - BALCONY BOX -- SAME
As ABRAHAM and MARY LINCOLN enjoy the performance.

The PRESIDENT tilts back-and-forth in a crimson rocking chair
The FIRST LADY lovingly drapes her hand across his knee.

A couple in their twenties, MAJOR RATHBONE and CLARA HARRIS,
are seated nearby.

...A P.0.V on the LINCOLNS and their GUESTS.
PULL BACK: INT. THEATER - HALLWAY -- SAME

Revealing the P.0.V is coming from a small PEEPHOLE in the
door leading to the President's BALCONY BOX.
6.

A Sliver of light barely illuminates the viewer's identity --
JOHN WILKES BOOTH, 26, Strikingly attractive and attired.

As Booth spies on President Lincoln...

MATCH CUT TO:
...A TALL MAN with a BLACK FELT HAT, spying too.
PULL BACK: EXT. MANSION -- SAME

Only, he's watching the ENTRANCE to a stately, three-story
MANSION from across Washington's Lafayette Square.

Private Residence
o
Secretary of State Frederick Seward

The Tall Man pulls a BOWIE KNIFE from beneath his felt hat,
a REVOLVER from his overcoat, and crosses the street.

He mounts the mansion's FRONT STOOP and rings the door BELL.
A BUTLER answers...

MATCH CUT TO:
...The DOOR swinging open.

Only, instead of the Tall Man entering, it's a SMALL MAN,
wearing a BEAVER SKIN CAP...

PULL BACK: INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- SAME

...And instead of the Mansion's entrance, we're now inside a
plush HOTEL LOBBY, crowded with GUESTS.

The Residence
o
Vice President Andrew Johnson

The Short Man shuffles UNCOMFORTABLY amidst all the opulence,
his EYES flashing to a CLOCK on the WALL, which reads:

10:15 P.M.
...The sudden POP of a CHAMPAGNE CORK.
PULL BACK: INT. CENTURY CLUB - BALLROOM -- SAME
As Baker opens a fresh bottle. Aiken has rejoined his mates.
BAKER
Good to see the last four years did
someone good.
REVEALING: the stunning CATHERINE MORGAN, early 20's.

BAKER (CONT'D)
Hello, Catherine.

CATHERINE
Too grown up to call me Katie anymore?
BAKER
You're the one who's grown up.

Catherine warmly greets Baker, Hamilton. Glances at Aiken.

CATHERINE
Johnny Reb' get his tongue?
AIKEN
How are you, Katie?
CATHERINE

Not a letter from you in 18 months.
I should ask how you are?

AIKEN
We didn't see much I wanted to share.
CATHERINE

(re. Hamilton)
Bill wrote me twice a month.

AIKEN

That so?
HAMILTON

Just checking in with the home front.
CATHERINE

One's imagination wanders when you
haven't a word.

; AIKEN ; ;
Might we have one now - in private?

Catherine nods, turns back to Baker and Hamilton.

CATHERINE
Sure good to see you, boys.

Aiken escorts Catherine away, fingers clasped. Hamilton
looks on with envy. Baker pops a cigar. LIGHTS a match...

CUT TO:
...The startling BANG of a pistol.

An EXPLOSION, like the deep POP of a heavy, paper bag. Then,
a BURST of smoke. And finally, a THUD, bullet against bone.

PULL BACK: INT. THEATER - PRESIDENTIAL BOX -- SAME

As Lincoln's rocking ceases, and his chin pitches into his
chest. MARY LINCOLN clutches his neck to keep him upright.

Booth stands a few paces behind -- a brass DERRINGER in his
right hand; a DAGGER in his left.

Major Rathbone dunges for Booth. But Booth swings his dagger
wildly, piercing the Major's left arm.
Booth vaults over the FRONT RAILING, and clips his SPUR in
the BUNTING, causing him to land awkwardly on the STAGE below.

SNAP! His left ankle fractures badly above the in-step. He
limps across the stage, stopping just long enough to YELL...

BOOTH
Sic Semper Tyrannis! Revenge for
the South.
Then, rushes past dazed ACTORS, and escapes into the WINGS.
EXT. SECRETARY OF STATE SEWARD'S RESIDENCE -- SAME

Just as Booth's TALL ACCOMPLICE bursts out the FRONT DOOR,
his hands dripping with blood.

INT. SECRETARY OF STATE SEWARD'S RESIDENCE -- CONTINUOUS
TRACKING through the house to REVEAL what's left behind:

-- First, the Tall Accomplice 's BLACK FELT HAT tipped on its
side, at the bottom of the staircase;

-- Then, a GUARD, coughing blood, writhing along the stairs;

-- Followed by an ARMY AIDE, badly hurt and bleeding, slumped
on the second floor landing;

-- Next, SEWARD'S SON, alive, but unconscious with a fractured
skull, inside a bedroom doorway;

-- And lastly, SECRETARY of STATE FREDERICK SEWARD, in bed
gasping for air and bleeding, from a near-fatal facial gash.

INT. THE VICE PRESIDENT'S RESIDENCE - HOTEL LOBBY -- SAME

Booth's SHORT ACCOMPLICE, with the BEAVER SKIN HAT, is frozen
with fear on a bar stool, his eyes leaden with drink.

A SOLDIER casts a suspicious glance his way, causing the
fearful Associate to flee out the front door, as we CUT TO --

INT. CENTURY CLUB - BALLROOM - SAME

Just as Aiken is placing an ENGAGEMENT RING on Catherine's
finger. Baker, now piss drunk, celebrates his mate's new
union by drinking champagne from his artificial leg.

A SOLDIER rushes past knocking Baker's leg out of his hands.

BAKER
What the hell?

Suddenly, Secretary Stanton is whisked away under heavy
security. Followed by several more party-goers.

Hamilton approaches Aiken and Catherine, his face ashen.

CATHERINE
What is it, Bill?
HAMILTON
They've attacked Lincoln - and the
Secretary of State too.

Aiken registers the shock. As Baker tries to locate his leg
amidst the tumult, we DISSOLVE TO --

A near-riotous crowd assembled outside PETERSEN HOUSE, a
townhouse across the street from Ford's Theater

Torches ablaze. Vengeance on many lips.
We TRACK with Union MAJOR H.W. SMITH inside --
INT. PETERSEN HOUSE - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

A small, sloped BEDROOM adorned with pastoral prints. It is
an unspectacular setting for a spectacular end.

DOCTORS, CABINET MEMBERS and a PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER surround
PRESIDENT LINCOLN, who is laying diagonally across a bed

far too short -- his bare feet angling over the edge. The
only sound is of Lincoln's near-final gasps.

Major Smith passes a PHYSICIAN carrying a bundle of
bloodstained towels. Smith continues down the HALLWAY, into --

An adjacent SITTING ROOM, now functioning as a WAR ROOM --
SEVERAL ACTORS, still in costume, are being interrogated.
Major Rathbone is trying to console his fiancee, Clara Harris.
Her clothes are soaked with Lincoln's blood.

Major Smith surveys the chaos -- revealing EDWIN STANTON is
in charge. Stanton beckons him inside a CLOAK ROOM.

MAJOR SMITH
It was the actor, John Wilkes Booth.

STANTON
Are you certain?

MAJOR SMITH
They all know him from the theater

Pointing to the ACTORS being interrogated in the other room.

STANTON
What about the other assassins?

MAJOR SMITH
The only name mentioned so far is an
acquaintance of Booth's -- a young
man named, John Surratt.

STANTON
What do we know about him?

MAJOR SMITH
Twenty-one years of age. Lives here
in the city with his family. Mother
runs a boardinghouse. That's it.
10.

STANTON

I guarantee he's a Confederate.
Find him. Find all of them.

(a beat)
I want this city closed down. Nothing
leaves Washington without my
authorization. No trains. No boats.
If any one of these assassins gets
South of the Potomac or up into
Canada, he'll never be found.

Major Smith exits. Another AIDE approaches.

AIDE
Sir, the Vice President wishes to
pay his respects.

STANTON
He may leave that hotel only when I
say it's safe to do so.

The Aide nods, begins to exit.

STANTON (CONT'D)
(calls out)
And keep him away from the liquor.
He's liable to drink himself into a
stupor with fright!

MARY LINCOLN lets out a piercing wail from the adjacent room.

FULL SCREEN: On President Lincoln's motionless FACE
accompanied by more screams.

PULL BACK: to reveal the screams are coming from a LOCOMOTIVE
whistling into the night, wrapped in black bunting. Lincoln's
face is actually a PORTRAIT fixed to the front of the train.
Lincoln's COFFIN is inside.

MONTAGE BEGINS:
As the train builds speed, we INTERCUT between:

LINCOLN'S DEIFICATION -- Newspaper headlines chronicle the
1700 mile funeral procession from Washington, D.C. to

Springfield, Illinois, his hometown and inal resting place.

"40,000 in the Rain in Cleveland"..."300,000 at Independence
Hall"..."Half a Million Along Broadway"

STANTON'S REIGN of TERROR -- The ROUND-UP of the alleged
ASSASSINS. Ford's Theater is chained shut; DOZENS are
arrested in saloons, churches, outhouses and homes.

BOOTH is cornered inside a BURNING FARMHOUSE. He is shot
and killed. Another accomplice, DAVID HEROLD, surrenders.

The FINAL IMAGES shown are of --
A slender three-story TOWNHOUSE along a residential street.

All appears peaceful. No sign of the hysteria beyond.
Suddenly, the FRONT DOOR bursts open.
11.

SIX SOLDIERS escort a MYSTERY WOMAN, 45, down the front stoop
while her DAUGHTER, 22, is restrained by several troops.

The Mystery Woman is placed inside a JAIL CELL. The DOOR is
slammed shut behind, plunging her world into darkness.

MONTAGE ENDS
FADE TO BLACK:
FADE UP: On the AMERICAN FLAG
PULL BACK: EXT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING -- DAY

A_ glimpse of the unmistakable CAPITOL DOME, its American
flag still flying at half-mast for Lincoln.

MAY 10, 1865

ONE MONTH LATER
INT. U.S. CAPITOL -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken races inside the ROTUNDA, nearly knocking over an
ELDERLY SENATOR in his path.

He sprints across STATUARY HALL, past the busts of our
Founding Fathers.

Aiken continues down a long HALLWAY lined with Senate offices
a stack of legal briefs virtually spilling out of his hands.

Finally, he enters through an enormous OAK DOOR bearing the
brass inscription:

United States Senator (Maryland)
Reverdy Johnson

He finds REVERDY JOHNSON already long in wait.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Mornin', young man. Nice of you to
show up.

AIKEN
My sincerest apologies, Senator. I
was just finishing the land conveyance
you requested.

The Senator performs a cursory review.

REVERDY JOHNSON
You've been up all night on this?

AIKEN
Most of it, sir.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Plus some carousing with your mates?

AIKEN
Just a bit.
12.

REVERDY JOHNSON
I appreciate your enthusiasm, Freddie.
I just hope you haven't run yourself
ragged, nor forgotten the Assassins'
Trial begins tomorrow.

AIKEN
No one's talking about anything else.
My mates and I hope to squirrel a
seat.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Well, you've 'squirreled' a chair
instead.

AIKEN
How's that, sir?

The Senator hands Aiken a stack of papers.

REVERDY JOHNSON
I'm trying the case. You'll be
assisting -- my second chair.

AIKEN
But I thought the government was
planning a military court-martial.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Indeed. Secretary Stanton picked
himself nine generals to serve as
judges -- all for Union and all
riends of the late President.

the bearded and bespectacled GENERAL HUNTER, 62,
his pearl-handled saber to his hip.

CUT BACK TO:
CAPITOL -- CONTINUOUS

As Aiken and Reverdy Johnson continue their conversation
through the hallway of the Capitol.

AIKEN
If it's a military trial, won't the
War Department be handling the
prosecution?

REVERDY JOHNSON
Stanton's put his most trusted in
charge of the case -- the Chief
Adjutant General, Joseph Holt.
13.
INT. WAR DEPARTMENT - STANTON'S OFFICE -- SAME

REVEALING Edwin Stanton's devoted aide-de-camp, JOSEPH HOLT,
56, as he devises a strategy with the War Secretary.

The corner features a shrine to Lincoln from Ford's Theatre --
Lincoln's rocking chair, top hat and coat -- blood-stained.

CUT BACK TO:
EXT. U.S. CAPITOL STEPS -- CONTINUOUS

As Aiken and Reverdy descend the steps, which are now lined
with folks hawking LINCOLN MEMORABILIA -- death portraits
supposed locks of hair...

AIKEN
Then, what are we to do?

REVERDY JOHNSON
Defend one of the eight.

KEN
One of the Assassins?

REVERDY JOHNSON
Alleged, counselor.

Reverdy Johnson holds up a NOTE.

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
I received a letter this morning
from the lady, the one with the
boardinghouse... a Mrs. Mary...

The Senator searches the note for Mary's last name. Aiken
is quick with the answer.

AIKEN
Surratt.

REVERDY JOHNSON
She says I once helped her late
husband on a tax matter.

AIKEN
But you don't recall?

REVERDY JOHNSON
Truth is I don't remember ever laying
eyes on her late husband or her.
But she's from Maryland too...

AIKEN
Sir, the government believes her
son, John, was Booth's right-hand.

REVERDY JOHNSON
If they suspect her son, then they
ought to try him.
14.

AIKEN
I've heard they have 250 agents out
looking for him. Senator, you don't
Know her. But you're still defending
er?

REVERDY JOHNSON
Young man, it matters none if I've
heard of Mary Surratt -- or her son.
She's entitled to a defense. So, I
shall defend her!

Reverdy continues onward as Aiken remains frozen in place.

GENERAL HUNTER (0.S.)
Mary Eugenia Jenkins Surratt...

PULL BACK: INT. U.S. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTROOM -- NEXT DAY

As we REVEAL -- MARY SURRATT, 45 -- dressed from head-to-toe
in black, her face concealed by a heavy veil. (She is the
Mystery Woman shown earlier being led from her home.)

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
You are charged with conspiring,
aiding and abetting...

GENERAL HUNTER, 62, reads from parchment, his saber dangling
by his side. He is surrounded by the members of the MILITARY
COMMISSION, nine grizzled Union vets, high-ranking all.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT. )
The late John Wilkes Booth -- and
his Confederates...

SEVEN 'CONFEDERATES' are revealed beside Mary Surratt as
each name is called. They are seated inside a raised
PRISONERS' DOCK. All are in their twenties or early thirties.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D. )
David Herold, Michael O'Laughlin,
Edward Span fer, Dr. Samuel Mudd
Samuel Arnold, George Atzerodt and
Lewis Payne...

(NOTE: Lewis Payne is readily identifiable as Booth's Tall
Accomplice; George Atzerodt as his shorter one.)

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
In a treasonous plot to murder
President Abraham Lincoln; Vice
President Andrew Johnson; and
Secretary of State William Seward...

The PACKED courtroom stirs with each charge.

Hastily converting a BARRACKS into a courtroom inside the
prison for security reasons, the chamber measures only 55-
feet x 20-feet with an 11-foot high ceiling. The WALLS are
freshly white-washed. All FOUR WINDOWS are barred.
15.

The PRESS and JUDGES are seated at long TABLES cutting the
room lengthwise. The GALLERY (by invitation only) are crammed
in at the rear. ARMED SOLDIERS are stationed throughout.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D. )
Pursuant to special orders #211 and
#216, does the accused wish to offer
a plea?

The veiled defendant is frozen with fear.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
What say you, madam? Guilty or not.

Mary Surratt removes her veil revealing a handsome face.

. MARY SURRATT
I am innocent.

GENERAL HUNTER
Of all charges?

MARY
Yes, sir. I most certainly am.

GENERAL HUNTER
In that case, as each defendant has
entered a not guilty plea, we'll
begin with the woman first -- the
United States versus Mary Surratt.

General Hunter looks to the PROSECUTION table positioned
advantageously by his side.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
Major Holt, please proceed.

Joseph Holt rises to begin, his chest laden with medals. He
is surrounded by a HALF-DOZEN ASSOCIATES.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Just a moment, your honor

Reverdy Johnson rises directly in front of Mary Surratt.
Frederick Aiken, his lone associate, remains seated beside.

GENERAL HUNTER
What is it, Senator?

REVERDY JOHNSON
I wish to request an adjournment.

GENERAL HUNTER
An adjournment! We just got here.

Even the LAWYERS defending the other prisoners seem shocked.

REVERDY JOHNSON
The defendant has been in custod
for over a month. But wasn't allowed
to contact counsel until yesterday.
(MORE )
16.

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
I've still not been permitted to
meet with her.

JOSEPH HOLT
Your honor, a delay will only serve
to prolong the nation's sorrow.

REVERDY JOHNSON
My learned colleague, you've had
four weeks to prepare your case. No
doubt, assisted by the entire War
Department. I believe the defendant
is entitled to equal consideration.

GENERAL HUNTER
Senator, our fellow citizens must be
allowed to put this tra edy to rest.
The sooner we dispose of this case,
the better for everyone.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Everyone but my client.

GENERAL HUNTER
Proceed, Major.

Holt rises.

REVERDY JOHNSON
In that case, I move for termination.

| | GENERAL HUNTER
Termination!

Aiken turns to the Gallery spotting Baker, Hamilton and
Catherine. Aiken looks as if he'd rather be anywhere else.

REVERDY JOHNSON
On the grounds this trial is
unconstitutional!

jehe, allery stirs)

The defendant is a civilian entitled
to a public trial before a jury of
her peers. Not a military court-
martial.

JOSEPH HOLT
Military courts adjudicated matters
involving civilians throughout the
war.

REVERDY JOHNSON
May I remind the distinguished Major
the war is over. Moreover, the civi.
courts in Washington remained open
throughout the entire conflict. And
continue to be, as we speak
17.

JOSEPH HOLT
And may I remind the Senator, the
Attorney General affirmed the
legitimacy of this proceeding:

Holt reaches for a DOCUMENT, which he reads aloud.

JOSEPH HOLT (CONT'D)
"Persons conspiring to assassinate
the President -- the Commander -in-
Chief -- are considered enemies of
the State. And shall be judged by a
military tribunal, as would soldiers
belonging to a hostile force."

REVERDY JOHNSON
"Soldier!' Surely, no member of
this Commission recalls a figure as
lovely as this under his command?

The Senator playfully draws gattery Ss physique in the air,
prompting laughter from the galle

GENERAL HUNTER
Senator, you will mind the horror
which summons us.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Gentlemen, we all mourn the loss of
our most cherished leader. But, in
our grief, let us not betray our
better judgment and execute a reign
of terror.

MAJOR GENERAL HARRIS, a member of the Military Commission
shouts out with a heavy New England accent.

GENERAL HARRIS
"Reign of Terror.' How dare you!

REVERDY JOHNSON
Every right-minded citizen desires
the punishment of those responsible.
But one must be judged accor ding to
the law -- not as passions see fi

GENERAL HUNTER
Senator, I assure you this tribunal
will make every effort to protect
the rights of those on trial. But,
all Americans have the right to feel
safe and secure.

REVERDY JOHNSON
None of us is safe when a citizen
can be dragged from her home, held
without charge and denied access to
counsel -- merely on a suspicion?

Another Commission Member, MAJOR GENERAL KAUTZ, mocks Reverdy
Johnson's southern accent. Kautz is a New Englander.
18.

GENERAL KAUTZ
"Mearlay onah suhspicion.' Sounds
to me like the enemy is among us. I
recall Maryland was not among our
most loyal states during the War. I
think its Senator ought to certify
his allegiance to this court.

BRIGADIER GENERAL HOWE chimes in with his Philadelphia accent.

GENERAL HOWE
I quite agree. Make him sign.

REVERDY JOHNSON
I have served this nation as its
Attorney General. That is
certification enough.

General Kautz holds up a CONTRACT.

GENERAL KAUTZ
Nevertheless, Senator. We may require
counsel to sign this oath of loyalty
as prescribed by Congress.

REVERDY JOHNSON
I_am a member of Congress! The branch
of government empowered to authorize
military tribunals like this.

GENERAL HUNTER
Our authorization comes from the War
Secretary, Edwin Stanton -- by order
of the President of the United States.

REVERDY JOHNSON

Had our founding fathers desired
tyranny to prevail, I'm sure they'd
have intended for the President and
his War Secretary to have such
indiscriminate powers.

(seething)
But they drafted a Constitution with
laws limiting power, not trusting in
human nature to limit itself --
precisely for times like these:

(losing his temper)
When our leaders claim to be serving
the People... when, in fact, they're
only serving themselves.

 

The Gallery erupts. The Prisoners beat iron against wood.
General Hunter slams his gavel, repeatedly.

GENERAL HUNTER
Order...Order...SILENCE!

Order is barely RESTORED.
GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)

This court will stand in recess.
Senator. In chambers!
19.
Off Aiken woefully glancing at his Mates, then at Catherine.
INT. U.S. ARSENAL PRISON - HALLWAY -- A SHORT TIME LATER

The prison CORRIDOR outside the generals' CHAMBERS is near-
RIOTOUS -- rabid REPORTERS, excited SPECTATORS, and the like.

Moments later, Reverdy Johnson appears in the hallway with
Aiken in-tow. The inquisitive PRESS converge in a frenzy.

Johnson pulls Aiken into a BACK STAIRWELL to escape the
hoards. A SOLDIER bars anyone else from following.

As Aiken trails his boss upstairs, his face is filled with
panic. The pair are in mid-conversation.

AIKEN
..But you can't be serious.

REVERDY JOHNSON
As serious as the charges against
our client.

AIKEN
But defending her? ME!

REVERDY JOHNSON
She doesn't stand a chance with a
Southerner like me representing her
She needs a Yankee colonel like you.

AIKEN
Yes, but --

REVERDY JOHNSON
-- You'll do fine, son. Our nation
still has never executed a woman.

AIKEN
This nation never considered a woman,
or aman for that matter, capable of
murdering the President. I'm sorry
but I can't take on this case.

REVERDY JOHNSON
"Course you can, boy. They taught
you somethin' at Harvard, didn't
they?

ATKEN
I mean, I won't
(off Reverdy s glare)
I won't defend he Not someone who
murdered my Commander -in-chief.

TwO SOLDIERS descend the stairs past Aiken and Reverdy.
They are guarding an attractive, unidentified WOMAN, 22.
She's just overheard Aiken and stares him down. Aiken
uncomfortable, waits for her to pass before continuing.
20.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
With all due respect, sir, I'll gladly
find you a rebel to represent her.

REVERDY JOHNSON
No court in the Union would judge
that woman fairly with Confederate
counsel.

AIKEN
Most folks I know wish for her what
happened to Booth.

REVERDY JOHNSON
No doubt you'd gladly pull the trigger
yourself.

AIKEN
I'd hardly be alone.

Aiken points to a CROWD outside the PRISON WALLS -- Lincoln
DEVOTEES holding shrines to Lincoln.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Look at Lincoln now! Remember how
so many used to hate him. Now, no
one dares utter a word against him,
let alone defend his murderer

REVERDY JOHNSON
Alleged, counselor.

AIKEN ;
You don't honestly believe she's
innocent?

REVERDY JOHNSON
'Til proven otherwise.

AIKEN
I will not betray my country, sir.
Nor my friends who died in battle
defending it.

The pair now stand directly in front of the COURTROOM DOORS.

REVERDY JOHNSON
I'm not suggesting you betray your
allegiances. I'm simply asking,
rather, telling you to uphold your
oath ee an attorney and do your job!
eat

I demand nothing more. And I assure
you, neither your mother or father
would've accepted anything less!

Aiken wavers.
AIKEN

Sir, I don't see how I can possibly
walk in there.
21.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Son, sometimes a man must be willing
to 'walk' on faith alone.

A beat as we begin to hear...
HOLT (0.S.)
The conspirators attempted what the
confederacy could not accomplish in
at
FULL SCREEN: On Aiken listening to Holt's opening argument.

INT. COURTROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

HOLT (0.S.)
To destroy our nation by striking at
our chain of command -- targeting

not_only our President, but the next
in line: his Vice President and
Secretary of State.

(Aiken looks distressed)
That a woman - a mother with children -
built the nest where this vile
conspiracy was hatched, operating a
safe-house for the assassins to meet.

 

PULL BACK: To reveal Mary over Aiken's shoulder. Both look
equally panicked but for different reasons.

HOLT (0.S.)
Makes Mary Surratt as guilty of this
crime as John Wilkes Booth himself!

EXT. U.S. ARSENAL PENITENTIARY -- LATER THAT EVENING

A UNION SOLDIER escorts Aiken across the prison grounds -- a
FORTRESS surrounded by BRICK WALLS topped by ARMED SENTRIES.
Just beyond the high walls JAMES CREEK, the foul smelling
repository for much of washington" s waste.

Blanketing the courtyard is a TENT ENCAMPMENT housing the
soldiers, who are guarding the prisoners on trial.

Aiken crosses through the encampment. SOLDIERS gather and
stare. Some salute Colonel Aiken. Others turn their backs.

INT. PENITENTIARY - CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

We continue with Aiken and his armed escort down a long
CORRIDOR lined with CELLS --

Each cell is packed with PRISONERS. Some faces are familiar --
the ACTORS being interrogated after Lincoln's assassination.
They are still wearing their costumes, now in tatters.

Off Aiken's look of confusion, the Guard offers up --

GUARD
The Witnesses, sir.
22.

AIKEN
How long have they been here?

GUARD
Coupla months.

Aiken is escorted through a pair of huge IRON DOORS. As he
continues down a SECOND STORY CATWALK, we REVEAL --

The CONSPIRATORS' CELLS, eight in all. Inside each cell
Aiken discovers the same horrifying sight -- a PRISONER, in
solitary, head covered by a CANVAS HOOD, no slot for seeing,
barely a hole for breathing. Legs and arms are chained to
IRON BALLS. Wrists are separated by piercing METAL MANACLES.

IKEN
Is all this necessary?
GUARD
According to orders.
AIKEN
Whose?
GUARD

Secretary Stanton, sir

Aiken lingers momentarily to ponder, then continues towards
the FINAL CELL at the end of the corridor.

INT. MARY SURRATT'S CELL -- CONTINUOUS

CELL DOOR number 200 swings opens as Aiken steps inside.
MARY is crouching on all fours, chained like a barnyard
animal. Though not forced to wear a hood, her ANKLETS and
WRIST CUFFS are painfully attached. STRAW is spread beneath
her; a BUCKET for bodily functions is nearby.

The Guard remains at the door

AIKEN
Thank you, private. That'll be all.

The Guard doesn't move.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
This meeting is confidential.

_ GUARD
Sorry, sir.

MARY (0.S.)
Where's the Senator?

Aiken turns toward Mary.
AIKEN

Ma'am, he's instructed me to handle
your case.
23.

MARY
Really?
AIKEN
Is there a problem?
MARY
No disrespect, Mister...
AIKEN
Frederick Aiken.
MARY
Mr. Aiken, how many years have you?
AIKEN
I'm a month past 28.
MARY
Young man, you're barely older than
my son.
AIKEN

The Senator would not have placed me
in this position unless he had
complete confidence in my abilities.

MARY
I take it then you've handled cases
like this before?

AIKEN
Ma'am, there's never been a case
like this before.

MARY,
But, you have defended others?

Aiken is silent.

MARY (CONT'D)
I see they've left nothing to chance.

AIKEN
I take it then you'd prefer to conduct
your own defense?

A beat. Off Mary's silence, Aiken opens his notes.
AIKEN (CONT'D)
Very well. I understand you own a
boardinghouse at 604 H Street, is
that correct?

MARY
Yes.

Aiken awaits more information. Mary offers none.
24.

Ma'am, all I know about you is what
I've read in the papers. And what
they're reporting isn't flattering.

Mary grudgingly.

MARY
I moved there a year ago with my son
and daughter after my husband passed
away.

AIKEN
The conspirators were frequent
visitors to your boardinghouse, were
they not?

Aiken doesn't even bother to call them alleged conspirators.

MARY
As were many others.

AIKEN
But, you don't deny having been
acquainted with John Wilkes Booth
or the other prisoners behind bars?

MARY
No, sir. I do not.
(sternly)

Mr. Aiken, my husband died a drunk
leaving me with loads of debt.

I had no other way to support my
family, except by renting rooms to
boarders. I considered those men
customers, nothing more.

/ AIKEN ; ;
Did you 'consider' their sentiments?

MARY
I did not inquire as to their
"sentiments,' sir.

AIKEN
What about yours, ma'am?

MARY
I am a Southerner by birth, a
Christian by belief, and a devoted
mother above all else. And I am NO
assassin!

AIKEN
Ma'am, your freedom will depend on
far more assurance than that.

MARY
Well, then you tell me what I should
say to those Generals?
A beat.

25.

AIKEN
Nothing. The rules prohibit you
from testifying in your own defense.
I suppose you know of someone else
who would? Your son, John, perhaps.
Any idea where he might be?

MARY
I do not. Even at 21, Mr. Aiken
he's still my baby. My son will be
kept out of this.

AIKEN
That won't be easy, ma'am. He's on
the wanted poster.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
How about his roommate, Louis
Wiechmann? Shall I call on him to
testify?

MARY
Louie is like a member of my family.
I don't want any harm coming to him
on account of me.

AIKEN
Is there anyone I can call upon to
give your version of events?

MARY _ ; ;
Who are they calling to give their
version?

AIKEN

The Government is not revealing its
list of witnesses, or the evidence
it plans to use against you.

MARY
They can't do that, can they?

AIKEN

This is a military proceeding in
which the Government can do just
about anything it chooses. Of course,
it makes preparing a defense more
difficult.

MARY

Of course. But what difference does
it make? Even these failing eyes of
mine can see those Generals made up

 

their minds -- just by the way they
were looking at me.
AIKEN

"Looking" at you?
26.

MARY
Just like you, Colonel.

A GUARD appears with Mary's dinner, hardly appetizing. Aiken
heads for the door.

AIKEN
I must go.

MARY
Mr. Aiken
(Aiken stops)
I haven't a word from my daughter
since they put me here. Would you
check on her for me? Please.

He reluctantly nods.

MARY (CONT'D)
Thank you, Mr. Aiken. I see you've
got a spark of human feeling in you
after all.

EXT. SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

The three-story townhouse seen during the round-up of the
alleged assassins. Aiken climbs the front stoop and knocks.
A Union SOLDIER is posted outside her door.

Aiken feels a PRESENCE behind -- NEIGHBORS spying from WINDOWS
and DOORWAYS. Aiken flips his collar to conceal his identity.

Finally, the boardinghouse DOOR opens.

AIKEN
Anna Surratt?

REVEALING: ANNA SURRATT, 22 -- a beautiful young woman who's
had to grow up very fast.

AIKEN. (CONT'D)
My name is Frederick...

ANNA SURRATT
I know who you are, Mr. Aiken.

AIKEN
Then you know I'm representing your
mother.

ANNA SURRATT
I was under the impression you could
not -- or rather, "would not".
Aiken now places her from the stairwell inside the courthouse.
AIKEN
I'm sorry you heard that. It was
meant to be a private conversation.

Aiken nervously glances back at the Neighbors.
27.

ANNA
Are you afraid or just embarrassed
to be seen with me, Mr. Aiken?

AIKEN
Your mother asked that I check on
you.

ANNA
If you will be so kind, please tell
her not to worry.

She begins to close the door.
AIKEN

Actually, I was hoping to get a look
inside.

He begins to enter. She momentarily blocks his path, then
reluctantly steps aside so he can enter.

INT. VESTIBULE -- CONTINUOUS
As Aiken enters the boardinghouse, he surveys the scene.

AIKEN
Are you the only one here?

ANNA
Business tends to slow down when
there's a soldier stationed out front
day and night for my "protection".

AIKEN
I'll take that as a "yes"?
ANNA
Yes.
Aiken moves from room-to-room -- each strikingly cozy and

familial. DAGUERREOTYPES of the Surratts line the mantels.

AIKEN
(under his breath)
It's perfect.

ANNA
Pardon.

AIKEN
Sorry, it's nothing.

ANNA

Please, do tell.
Aiken says nothing.
ANNA (CONT'D)

Mr. Aiken, I'm sure I've heard much
worse in the past month.
28.

AIKEN
Very well. I was thinking this would
be the perfect place to conspire to
overthrow the government.

ANNA
No one would ever suspect, right?

Aiken doesn't know what to make of Anna.

AIKEN
May I take a look upstairs?

Anna knows why Aiken is here. Without missing a beat --
ANNA

My brother's room is the third on

the left.
INT. SECOND FLOOR -- A SHORT WHILE LATER
Aiken ascends the narrow STAIRCASE up to the SECOND FLOOR,
then crosses down a short HALLWAY. He enters a small BEDROOM
with two single beds, a desk and dresser inside.
Aiken begins to carefully search the bedroom -- underneath
the beds, the desk, then inside the DRESSER. He finds
undergarments, rolled socks...and, finally, a slip of PAPER.
Just as he pockets the paper, Aiken is startled from behind.

ANNA
Find what you were looking for?

Aiken quickly recovers. Rises.
AIKEN
Louis Wiechmann shared this room,
correct?

ANNA
That's correct.

AIKEN
Have you seen him recently?

ANNA
No, I haven't. Did you see much
action?
Anna is staring at Aiken's UNIFORM.

AIKEN
A bit.

ANNA
Kill any on our side?

A beat.
29.

AIKEN
Miss Surratt, do you have records
indicating who stayed here? A
registry? A book of accounts?
(no reply)
Do you want me to help your mother
or not?

We hold on Anna, as we CUT TO --
FULL SCREEN: On a FLOORBOARD being pried loose
PULL BACK: INT. VESTIBULE -- SHORT TIME LATER
As Anna produces a REGISTRY from beneath the floorboard.
She hands it to Aiken.
AIKEN
Anything else you're hiding?

ANNA
Such as?

AIKEN
Your brother to start.
(silence)
If you know where he is, I need to
know. Is that clear?

ANNA

Do you have siblings, Mr. Aiken?
AIKEN

No.
ANNA

I thought not.

Suddenly, there is a tremendous CRASH --
Glass sprays across the floor

Aiken dives on top of Anna, placing them nose-to-nose.
A large ROCK rests beside them, inscribed in blood-red:

DIE REBEL DIE
Aiken pulls himself off Anna, races OUTSIDE revolver drawn...
EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken turns to the Guard outside the door, still standing in
place as if nothing has happened.

AIKEN
Who did that?

SOLDIER
Did what, sir?

You're telling me you didn't just
see someone throw that rock
30.

SOLDIER
Guess I missed it, sir.

Aiken gets it. He returns back inside...
INT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken commands Anna, his gun still drawn.

AIKEN
Pack up. I'm getting you out of
here.

ANNA
I'm not going anywhere.

AIKEN
It's not safe for you to be here all
alone.

Anna calmly picks up the rock, and walks it across the room.

ANNA
I've managed thus far.

She places the rock on a shelf, steps back revealing a small
pile of similar rocks.

AIKEN
Let's go. I will arrange for other
accommodations.

ANNA ; ;
A cell at Arsenal Penitentiary? No,
thank you.

AIKEN
I will not have it on my conscience
should something happen to you.
ANNA
Would you please holster your weapon,
Colonel.
Off Anna remaining resolute, we CUT TO --
INT. BEDROOM -- SHORT WHILE LATER

As Aiken now prepares Louis Wiechmann's bed for sleep.

ANNA
Breakfast is at seven. Supper at
six.

AIKEN

This is only for one night. I'll
have a new guard posted out front
tomorrow.

As Anna starts to exit, she calls out.
31.

ANNA
You're on your own for lunch.

FADE TO BLACK:
Remain in DARKNESS and SILENCE for several beats... indicating
the passage of time... then the SOUND of a SLAMMING DOOR.
Aiken LIGHTS a lantern as we --
FADE UP: INT. BEDROOM -- HOURS LATER, MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Aiken, startled AWAKE from a deep sleep, tries to make out
the VOICES coming from downstairs, accompanied by BOOTS
clomping across hardwood floors.
He rises from Wiechmann's BED, heads toward the noise --
STAIRWELL,
Tiptoeing downstairs to the --
GROUND FLOOR,

The voices grow louder as he nears the PARLOR DOOR, which is
slightly ajar. Aiken creeps forward, trying to peek inside.

Aiken's POV: of a HALF-DOZEN MEN crowded around a table.
Anna is serving them coffee.

Aiken inches closer to get a better look. The FLOORBOARD
buckles beneath in the spot where Anna hid the registry.

The creak of the floorboard silences the voices inside.
Suddenly, the DOOR swings open on Aiken.

He is frozen in place.
MALE VOICE (0.S.)
What kept you, Freddie? We've been
waiting a long time.

Aiken's expression turns to shock as we reveal the speaker's
identity -- JOHN WILKES BOOTH.

SLAM CUT TO:
PRESENT TIME: INT. BEDROOM

Aiken wakes with a start from his BAD DREAM. His brow is
soaked with sweat, concern etched across Aiken's face.

FADE TO BLACK:

FADE UP:
EXT. U.S. ARSENAL PRISON - FRONT GATE -- NEXT MORNING
The atmosphere outside the prison is part-carnival, part-mob --

VENDORS hawk SOUVENIRS and REFRESHMENTS, while an angry MOB
eagerly awaits the first witness in Mary Surratt's trial.
32.

They are carrying PLACARDS calling for the prisoners' heads.
A life-size EFFIGY of Mary Surratt hangs from a lamp pole.

MARY SURRATT (0.S.)
How is she?

PULL BACK: INT. COURTROOM -- SAME

Mary leans across the bar to confer with Aiken. The other
prisoners on trial are seated beside her.

AIKEN
Your daughter is... fine. She's
looking forward to the day you come
home.

MARY
It's nice of you to say -- even if

you don't think that day is coming
any time soon.

HOLT (0.S.)
In the matter of the United States
v. Mary Surratt...

The Prosecutor, JOSEPH HOLT, announces to the court.

HOLT.
...the People call as their first
witness -- Lieutenant Louis Wiechmann.

LOUIS WIECHMANN, 22, marches in, PATRIOTISM personified --
resplendent in Union blue. He settles confidently into the
WITNESS BOX, at center, as the BAILIFF stands ready.

Aiken leans over to Mary.

AIKEN
Why would the prosecution be calling
him?

MARY
I have no idea.

BAILIFF
Take this Bible in your right hand.
Now repeat after me.

Mary looks at Wiechmann, who, in turn, looks away.

BAILIFF/WEICHMANN
(responsively)
The evidence I shall give before
this Court, shall be the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Major Holt approaches the witness.

HOLT (0.S.)
Lieutenant Wiechmann, are you
acquainted with the defendant, Mary
Surratt?
33.

WIECHMANN
Yes. Yes, I am. I attended divinity
college with her son, John.

HOLT
Until recently you resided at the
boardinghouse owned by Mrs. Surratt.
Isn't that correct?

WIECHMANN
That is correct, sir.

Holt gestures to the prisoners' dock

HOLT
Were any of those prisoners ever
present in her home?

WIECHMANN
Yes, sir. Those five to the right.

Pointing at the five furthest to the right -- HEROLD, ARNOLD,
O'LAUGHLIN, ATZERODT and PAYNE.

WIECHMANN (CONT'D)
They were 'present' many times.

HOLT
At whose invitation?

WIECHMANN
Her son's.

AIKEN
Objection!

HOLT
Objection?

Aiken rises, but tentatively.

AIKEN

Uh, yes, there's no way of knowing...
I mean no foundation John Surratt

even knew these men -- let alone
invited them. And since Mr. Surratt's
whereabouts are_unknown at this time,
the question calls for speculation.

GENERAL HUNTER

Mr. Surratt's absence from this
roceeding is Mr. Surratt's problem.
bjection overruled. Continue, Major

 

ou

Aiken sits down.

HOLT
Was John Wilkes Booth a frequent
guest of John Surratt's?
34.

WIECHMANN
Indeed. But all the Surratts adored
him. John. His sister, Anna. And
their mother, too.

Wiechmann glances at Mary.

HOLT
Were there ever meetings at the
boardinghouse involving Mr. Booth?

WIECHMANN
Many. Sometimes lasting two, three
hours. And always in secret, behind
closed doors.

HOLT
Did you ever see Mary Surratt object
to these meetings?
. WIECHMANN
No, sir.
HOLT

Or to the presence of those men?
Pointing at the prisoners.
Wiechmann and Mary's eyes meet, then Wiechmann looks away.

WIECHMANN
No, I did not. She appeared to
welcome them.

HOLT
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you
very much. That'll be all for now.

Wiechmann rises and begins to leave. Aiken is fumbling
through his notes. He seems lost.

AIKEN (0.S.)
How long did you say these â€˜secret
meetings' lasted?

Wiechmann stops in his tracks. Returns to the witness box.

WIECHMANN
At least, two...three hours.

AIKEN
Yes, that's right.

Finally, Aiken looks up from his notes.

AIKEN. (CONT'D)
So, if you were timing them,
Lieutenant...then, I suppose, these
"secret meetings' weren't actually a
secret kept from you.
35.

WIECHMANN
I knew about them, sir. But, I had
no knowledge of what they were about.

AIKEN
That's because you never attended
any yourself?

WIECHMANN
Exactly!
AIKEN
And why was that?
WIECHMANN
I thought them suspicious.
AIKEN
"Suspicious'! So then, you did know
what they were about?
WIECHMANN
No, sir. I did not.
AIKEN
Then why were your suspicions aroused?
WIECHMANN

By the snatches of rebel conversation
I overheard in the hallways. And by
their frequent whisperings.

AIKEN
Well, in that case. Why didn't you
immediately report your 'suspicions'
to your superiors at the War
Department?

WIECHMANN
My suspicions weren't of a fixed and
settled nature.

AIKEN
"Fixed and Settled.' Were you
instructed to use those words?

WIECHMANN
Absolutely not.

Aiken ponders a moment, then sits down.

GENERAL HUNTER
If there's nothing else, Colonel.

AIKEN
Uh, I do have something else, sir.
Tell me, Mr. Wiechmann. Tell us.
Have you ever been to Richmond?

HOLT
Objection.
36.

AIKEN
I merely wish to know if the
Lieutenant has ever visited the
capital of Virginia - and Confederacy.

General Hunter nods for Wiechmann to answer.

WIECHMANN
I don't recall.

Aiken withdraws the slip of PAPER -- the one he pocketed the
night before at the boardinghouse.

AIKEN
Perhaps, this train receipt will
refresh your memory. It indicates
passage to Richmond, and has your
name on it.

WIECHMANN
Yes. That's right. I considered
continuing my divinity studies there
after the war. I plan on becoming a
minister.

AIKEN
A noble calling, indeed. At what
institute in Richmond did you think
of enrolling?

WIECHMANN
The name?
AIKEN
Yes, Lieutenant. The NAME!
WIECHMANN
Well, ah...
HOLT
Objection!
AIKEN

There is no academy of the kind in
Richmond, is there, sir?

HOLT
Objection, your honor!

AIKEN
Perhaps, you visited Richmond for
another purpose entirely?

HOLT
The question is argumentative.

AIKEN
I'll withdraw the question.
Lieutenant, you worked for the General
in charge of rebel prisoners, did
you not?
37.

WIECHMANN
Yeah, so?

AIKEN
So perhaps, a distinguished clerk
like yourself knew information.

WIECHMANN
What sort of 'information'?

AIKEN
Of the sort that might've been of
divine interest to many rebels within
the capital of the Confederacy.

| ; HOLT .
Objection, your honor! The witness
is not on trial here.

The prisoner, LEWIS PAYNE, yells out from the dock.

LEWIS PAYNE
He ought to be!

GENERAL HUNTER
Objection allowed. The witness is
not on trial.

AIKEN
Sir, I am simply trying to establish
theâ€™ credibility... or rather, the
lack of credibility.

HOLT
Objection!

GENERAL HUNTER
Colonel Aiken, you are incriminating
the witness.

AIKEN
"incriminating the witness"! The
Lieutenant shared a room with John
Surratt. I think it reasonable to
conclude Mr. Wiechmann might know a
thing or two about this plot to
assassinate our President.

HOLT
what the Colonel
is entirely irrelevant!

GENERAL HUNTER
Counselor, unless you have something
more pertinent to ask, the witness
will stand down.

; AIKEN ;
No, sir. No. I have nothing more
"pertinent" to ask.

Your honor

"concludes"
38.

EXT. CENTURY CLUB -- EARLY EVENING

A discrete BRASS SIGN is all that identifies the entrance.
Illuminated by GAS LANTERNS, it says all one needs to know
about the elite, all-male SOCIAL CLUB inside:

The Century Club
- A Gentleman's Preserve -

INT. CENTURY CLUB - SMOKING ROOM -- SAME

Aiken enters the smoke-filled room. A HALF-DOZEN youn
HOTSHOTS, including Baker and Hamilton, are playing poker.

HAMILTON
Someone should tell the Colonel he's
got on the wrong uniform.

AIKEN
I thought we're permitted to dress
down in here, if no lady is present.

BAKER
Fred's right.

HAMILTON
My mistake then. I just thought the
Colonel traded his blues for gray.

Several laugh at Aiken.

AIKEN
Is Treasury now hiring arselickers
or did they make an exception for
you, Bill? 'Cause after I'm done
making a name for myself in the trial
of the century, I'll need to protect
my rear.

The men start laughing at Hamilton.

HAMILTON
That name is Judas.

Hamilton rises. Squares off with Aiken.
BAKER
Knock it off, Hamilton. Aiken, sit
down and join the game.

AIKEN
I've got to prepare for trial.

BAKER
You've got time enough for a drink.
Hamilton's buying.

Aiken reluctantly takes a seat. Baker deals Aiken in.
BAKER (CONT'D)

So, Freddie. Tell us. How did you
know?
39.

AIKEN
"Know"?

BAKER
That the Lieutenant was lying. That
there's no divinity schoo in â€œall of
Richmond.

AIKEN
I didn't.

BAKER
You bluffed?

AIKEN
And he folded.

Several chuckle aloud with the notable exception of Hamilton,
who refuses to join in any adoration of Aiken.

At that instant, SECRETARY STANTON passes by the door.
Stanton holds a_ menacing gaze on Aiken for several moments
before exiting frame. Hamilton observes the exchange.

HAMILTON
Appears the Secretary doesn't care
much for your cards!

HOLD ON: Aiken looking visibly troubled.
INT. U.S. CAPITOL - REVERDY JOHNSON'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

Aiken, still concerned, confers with Reverdy Johnson, who is
reviewing the previous day's TRIAL TRANSCRIPT.

AIKEN
He did not look pleased.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Your cross wasn't exactly what
Stanton's kangaroo court had in mind.
I'm sorry I wasn't there to enjoy
it.

Reverdy smiles. Aiken does not.

AIKEN
Wiechmann would've said anything to
save his hide. But it still doesn't
justify Mary Surratt befriending
Booth or the others.

REVERDY JOHNSON
The makings of a case, but hardly
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

AIKEN ;
What about those "secret meetings"
Wiechmann testified to?
40.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Louis Wiechmann is a liar. You
practically said so in court.

AIKEN
Wiechmann is just the start. Who
knows what else they've got on her

REVERDY JOHNSON
Exactly. _'Cause Stanton is keeping
it under lock and key -- in violation
of every known rule of evidence.

AIKEN
If the Secretary's so out of line,
why are we the only ones saying so?
Not one court in the nation has
objected to this tribunal. And the
public supports it ten to one.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Because everyone's scared to death.
You did read Cicero at that fancy
school of yours?

Aiken nods.

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Inter Arma Silent Leges.

AIKEN
"In time of war, the law is silent."
(a beat)
But the war is over.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Stanton intends to keep it alive for
as long as he sees fit.

Reverdy pushes a newspaper in front of Aiken. HEADLINE reads:

Stanton warns of future Rebel Plots:
Poisoning Nation's Water Supply,
Spreading Smallpox & Firebombing Cities

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Fear is the most potent weapon in
the Secretary's arsenal.

AIKEN
Who's to say any of this won't happen?
The unthinkable already has. 600,000
men slaughtered on the battlefield.
Our President murdered while in
office. The world has changed --
and so must we.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Don't be so eager to throw away Mary
Surratt's rights. One day, you may
need them.
41.

AIKEN
Sir, I appreciate your confidence in
me. I really do. But you should
find someone who gives a damn if her
rights are violated. I don't. Not
after what she did.

REVERDY JOHNSON
You're right, Fred. I can't expect
you to care. I'll tell you what:
if you prove to_me beyond a reasonable
doubt she's guilty, I'll take you
off this case.

AIKEN |
Are you serious, sir?

Reverdy nods. Aiken smiles.

| _. REVERDY JOHNSON
You think it'll be that easy?

AIKEN
I know it.

EXT. U.S. ARSENAL PRISON -- MORNING
As the SUN beats down on the prison walls.
INT. MARY SURRATT'S CELL -- SAME

Aiken enters and finds Mary, to his_surprise kneeling in
prayer before a Catholic priest, FATHER WALTER, late-30's

AIKEN
Pardon me, Father. I wish to confer
with the prisoner.

MARY

Speak freely, Mr. Aiken.
AIKEN

Alone, if you don't mind.
MARY

All things are naked and open unto
the eye of the Lord.

FATHER WALTER
Quite all right, Mary. I must be
going anyway. See you in a week.

MARY
Thank you for visiting, Father walter
Your words were most comforting.

Father Walter departs. Mary puts aside her Bible, removes
her reading glasses.

MARY (CONT'D)
Search me, and know my heart
(MORE )
A beat.

42.

MARY (CONT'D)
Try me, and know my thoughts. And
see if there be any wicked way in
me.

AIKEN
The Lord knows the way of the wicked,
and the way of the wicked will perish.

MARY
You know your Proverbs, young man.

AIKEN
My father read them to me each night.

MARY
Is that right?

AIKEN
Said it contained all I needed to
know. Good versus evil, right versus

wrong.
MARY

Is your world so black and white?
AIKEN

When it comes to doing what's right.

MARY
So, what is it you wish to know?

AIKEN
Why Booth and his associates were
constantly in your home?

MARY
I ran a boardinghouse, Mr. Aiken.
Forgive me if I chose to fill it
with boarders.

AIKEN
I checked your registry. There's no
record Booth ever stayed with you.
Fact is, he checked into the National
whenever he came to town. So, why
was he a regular in your home?

MARY
I suppose my son invited him. They
were friends.

AIKEN
A famous actor like Booth engaging
your son out of friendship. I find
hat hard to believe.
43.

MARY
Ny Johnnie is no less a gentleman
than you, Mr. Aiken, and capable of
forming acquaintances in society.

AIKEN
I've read all about your family's
acquaintances, ma'am. About your
late husband contributing to the
Confederate cause; about your eldest
son, Isaac, fighting for the rebel
army down in Texas; and about your
'Gentleman' Johnnie, too.

MARY
What about him?

AIKEN
He made quite a sum as a Confederate
courier carrying rebel secrets across
enemy lines. So, I know damn well
what your family's capable of, and I
know you're not telling me the truth.

MARY
Then you know what I do not.

AIKEN
You were despondent over losing the
war, and would've done anything to
save the Confederacy -- including
using your own son, John.

MARY
Honestly, Mr. Aiken.

AIKEN
So, you arranged a meeting with Booth --
figuring he'd befriend your son
because of what John knew -- what
expert couriers know --

MARY
And what might that be?

AIKEN
The best escape routes out-of-town.

MARY
I take it there's more.

AIKEN
Your son was supposed to lead the
other assassins to freedom that night.
Except, your son was the only one
that got away.

MARY
Quite persuasive, Mr. Aiken. Except
my son was up in Canada at the time
of the assassination.
44.

AIKEN
Where exactly in Canada was he?

MARY
Exactly, I don't know.

Off Aiken's DISBELIEF.

MARY (CONT'D)
Does your mother know your exact
whereabouts at all times?

Silence.

MARY (CONT'D)
Very well.

Mary withdraws a wrinkled POSTCARD from inside her corset.

MARY (CONT'D)

My son sent this to me from Canada,
the same day as the assassination.
Proves he was out-of-town that night.

AIKEN
Proves nothing. He could've had it
sent.

Aiken drops the card. It flutters to the cell floor. Mary
scrambles in her chains to retrieve it. Aiken looks down at
Mary with a cold detachment.
AIKEN (CONT'D)
Perhaps, to save your daughter, you'd
consider telling me the truth.
Mary turns, looks up beseechingly at Aiken.

MARY
What's happened to Anna?

Aiken LIES to her.

AIKEN
She's disappeared.

MARY
Where to?

AIKEN

I have no idea. I suspect they intend
to hang her alongside of you.

MARY,
You're cruel, Colonel Aiken.

AIKEN
If you want to help her, ma'am, you
better start telling me the truth.
45.

MARY
I'll tell you anything to protect my
daughter. Even if it means confessing
to something I did not do.

AIKEN
Guard.

Aiken raps on the cell door

AIKEN (CONT'D)
I'm not defending your lies any
longer. And I damn well am not making
enemies on account of you.

Aiken begins to exit.

MARY
You say you want the truth, Mr. Aiken.
But you're so blind with vengeance,
you can't see it anymore.

AIKEN
Try me.

MARY
My son abhorred the North. We all
did! How can a Southerner not feel
anything but bitterness towards your
side for denying us our independence?
But, my son did not conspire to kill
your President.

A beat. Aiken turns to leave.

MARY (CONT'D)
He conspired to kidnap him.

Aiken STOPS DEAD in his tracks.

AIKEN
KIDNAP Lincoln?

CUT TO:
...A SLENDER MAN, 21, with wispy goatee atop a horse.
PULL BACK: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
It is JOHN SURRATT, and he's concealed in the bushes along a
remote road. SIX more HORSEMEN are hidden on either side.
All but John Surratt are familiar from the trial -- ATZERODT,
ARNOLD, HEROLD, O'LAUGHLIN, PAYNE and BOOTH.

A FANCY CARRIAGE approaches from around the bend. The
kidnappers await Booth's signal to strike.

Suddenly, Surratt's HORSE bucks prematurely.

The COACHMAN spots him, then the others. He strikes his
whip, plunging his Carriage forward. Booth SIGNALS to pursue.
46.

The Carriage races ahead. Booth and Payne cut through the
WOODS. The Coachman takes it too fast around a curve, causing
his Carriage to pitch momentarily onto two wheels.

Booth and Payne intercept the Carriage, their RIFLES drawn.
Surratt is the last to pull up alongside.

Everything is already well under control. The Coachman is
unlocking the Carriage door. But Surratt is overeager and
pokes him with his GUN.

JOHN SURRATT
We got ourselves Abe.

He exclaims as the Carriage door is pulled open, revealing --
TwO MIDDLE-AGED LADIES -- corpulent and panic-stricken.

Booth looks DAGGERS at Surratt.

EXT./INT. SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE -- LATER (FLASHBACK CONT.)
The failed KIDNAPPERS ride up to the front stoop, as seen
from Mary's POV out the parlor window. As John Surratt leads

the others INSIDE, Mary retreats to the back of the house
where Anna is cleaning.

MARY
Anna, upstairs.

ANNA
Mother.

MARY
Now.

Anna heads upstairs. Mary remains. She can barely make out
what is being said down the hall.

SAMUEL ARNOLD, 31, is barking at DAVID HEROLD, 23.

SAMUEL ARNOLD
The war is lost now 'cause of you.

DAVID HEROLD
I was told he'd be there.

JOHN SURRATT
He's right. I heard the same thing.

MICHAEL O'LAUGHLIN
(to Surratt)
You couldn't even control your mount.

LEWIS PAYNE
Fools like you two are the reason
we're losing this fight.

Payne pushes Surratt. O'Laughlin squares off with Herold.
Booth raises his PISTOL. He points the barrel at Herold.

BOOTH
Enough!
47.

DAVID HEROLD
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

Then he aims it at Surratt. Holds it there.

JOHN SURRATT
Wilkes, what are you doing?

Booth fingers the trigger. Mary calls out.

MARY (0.S.
Johnnie Surratt, I'd like a word
with you.
Booth lowers his gun.
BOOTH
Answer, Johnnie. Your mommy's

calling.
Off the others laughing at the young man, we CUT BACK TO --
PRESENT TIME: INT. MARY'S CELL --
Aiken is rapt as Mary reveals the details of the plot.

MARY
Seemed they planned on ransoming him
in_exchange for all the Confederate
soldiers kept inside your prisons.

AIKEN
Why didn't you report them to the
authorities?

MARY
"Cause one of 'them' was my son.

AIKEN
Instead of kidnapping the President
your son helped murder him -- and he
nearly got the Vice President and
Secretary of State as well.

MARY _
No. Not my Johnnie.

; AIKEN /
Damn it, ma'am. You just said so
yourself.

_ MARY
No, my son is not a murderer.

Aiken thrusts Mary's BIBLE at her.

_ AIKEN
Swear to it.

Mary's agony is evident...
As we CUT TO --
48.

INT. SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

DOWNSTAIRS, Anna cooks a meal for many. UPSTAIRS, Mary enters
her son's bedroom to find John busy packing.

MARY
Wash up, Johnnie. Supper will be
ready shortly.

JOHN SURRATT
I can't stay, mama. I have to leave
town straightaway.

MARY
What could be more pressing than
fried chicken?

JOHN SURRATT
Nothing that need worry you. Just
some cotton speculating, that's all.

MARY
Don't sport with me, son! You're
not stepping outside this house.

JOHN SURRATT
Don't speak to me like I'm a child.

MARY
You and Anna are all the family I've
got left. I'll be damned if I let
you run off and do something else
oolish.

JOHN
"Foolish!" What I'm fighting for is
far more important than any of us.

MARY
Sweetheart, nine tenths of our army
is buried underground. You think
they'll wait until we grow another?
The war is all but over, love. There
is nothing more you can do.

JOHN
The war is far from over, mother
There's still much we can do!

John turns to leave. Mary grabs hold.

MARY
John, please.

JOHN
Unhand me, mother.

But Mary won't let go. John pushes Mary as he tries to break
free. She stumbles, banging her face on the table -- cutting
her eyebrow. Blood begins to trickle down her face.
49.

BOOTH (0.S.)
(shouts from downstairs)
John, are you coming or not?
JOHN SURRATT
For God's sake, mother, if this cause
ain't worth dying for, what is?
He turns and exits. Off Mary's dismay we CUT BACK TO --

AIKEN (0.S.)
And this happened when?

PRESENT TIME: INT. MARY'S CELL --
A SCAR, now healed, is above Mary's RIGHT EYE.

MARY
April 3rd.

AIKEN
Eleven days prior to the
assassination?
Mary nods. Tears are streaking her face.
AIKEN (CONT'D)
So then you admit your son did
conspire to murder President Lincoln?

MARY
I don't know.

AIKEN
May God help you.

Aiken turns for the door
MARY
Honestly, I don't. Lord, I pray
not. I only know that I did not.
(a beat)

I swear.
Mary's hand is on the Bible. Off Aiken and Mary in silence.
EXT. ARSENAL PENITENTIARY -- MOMENTS LATER, DUSK
As Aiken exits the front gate.

He stops and turns back toward the prison -- with a look of
stunned disbelief.

And then continues on his way...
EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- SHORT TIME LATER

Aiken purposefully ascends the front stoop. He salutes the
new SOLDIER posted out front, and enters without knocking.
INT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

50.

Aiken beelines for Anna, who is sweeping up shattered glass.

AIKEN
You knew about the train ticket,
didn't you?

ANNA

And good evening to you, Colonel.
Did you see my mother?

AIKEN
She's fine.

ANNA
You told her not to worry about me?

Again, Aiken lies.

AIKEN
Yes, I told her. Why didn't you
just give me the ticket? Instead of
oping I'd find it.

Anna ascends a ladder to fix a broken window.

ANNA
Because you never would've offered
it in Court.

AIKEN
What are you talking about?

ANNA
Chain of Custody: the ability to
guarantee evidence from collection
to presentation in Court.

Off Aiken's surprised look, Anna explains --

ANNA (CONT'D)
Counselor, a boardinghouse with no
guests leaves one with plenty of
spare time.

Then nods to a stack of law journals nearby.

AIKEN
Then you're aware I can't possibly
defend your mother unless I know
what's coming next.

/ ANNA
Meaning?

AIKEN
I believe you know what witnesses
the prosecution may call, and the
evidence they'll use against her.
51.

ANNA
Wonderful, Mr. Aiken. Now, you're
accusing me of "building the. nest".
At least you're introducing reasonable
doubt for my mother.

Smash! Anna whacks a broken pane from the window.

AIKEN
Do you need some help?
ANNA
I can manage.
AIKEN
Please let me do it.
ANNA

Thanks just the same. But my father
and brother's example taught me never
to depend on a man.

A beat.

AIKEN
How dong . did you know Lt. Wiechmann
was working for the Confederacy?

ANNA
A while. And he didn't work hard
enough.

AIKEN
Excuse me.

ANNA
Lou was too much of a coward to devote
himself to the Cause. That's why
I'd never consider marrying him.

AIKEN
He proposed to you?

ANNA
Don't seem so surprised by the notion
Mr. Aiken. Fact is, I was in love

with a man -- not_a boy. Lt.
Wiechmann didn't like that.
AIKEN

You really think that's why he
testified against your mothe

. ANNA | |
For it is written, vengeance is mine.

AIKEN
Any other Louis Wiechmanns I need to
be prepared for?

Anna, atop the ladder, turns and catches Aiken's eye wandering
up the back of her skirt.
52.

ANNA
Are you more interested in me or
defending my mother, Colonel?

AIKEN
I'm interested in the truth. Starting
with: where's your brother?

ANNA
I don't have the slightest idea.

AIKEN
Then perhaps you'll level with me
about what I can expect next at trial.

Several beats ensue.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
You're going to have to learn to
"depend" on me, Miss Surratt.

Anna thinks on it.

Finally, she descends the ladder. She gestures Aiken into
the PARLOR -- the exact spot where Booth and the others met.
As Anna and Aiken begin to go over the case, we CUT TO --

HOLT (0.S.)
...Let us_ proceed with events
immediately following the
assassination of President Lincoln.

PULL BACK: INT. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTROOM -- NEXT MORNING
MAJOR H.W. SMITH, precise in manner and response, fills the
WITNESS BOX. (The Major was seen earlier reporting to Stanton
immediately after the assassination.) The prosecutor, HOLT,
is beside him, as the case against Mary Surratt continues.
HOLT
Major Smith, what were your duties
that night?
MAJOR SMITH
I was charged with finding John
Surratt.
INT. SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE - PARLOR -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A DOZEN POLICEMEN ransack the house, fii pping over furniture,
paintings and rugs. A PATROLMAN approaches Major Smith.

PATROLMAN #1
No sign of the son.

PATROLMAN #2 comes down the stairs.

PATROLMAN #2
Major, take a look.

He hands the Major a stack of card-sized PICTURES.
53.

PATROLMAN
We found these upstairs in the
daughter's bedroom.

Pointing at Anna Surratt, still in her nightshirt. Louis
Wiechmann is nearby, looking fearful.

INSERT: Each IMAGE as the Major flips through them:

-- First, a half-dozen DAGUERREOTYPES of CONFEDERATE GENERALS,
including pictures of Generals Lee, Beauregard and Jackson.

-- Then, a PRINTED CARD featuring the seal of the state of
Virginia with Confederate flags.

-- And lastly, a color LITHOGRAPH of a nursery fable, titled:
"Morning, Noon & Night".

The Major examines the fable more closely. He flips it over
revealing a PHOTO on the reverse side of JOHN WILKES BOOTH.

MAJOR SMITH
Young lady, does this belong to you?

Mary shields her daughter

MARY
This young lady belongs to me!

PRESENT TIME: INT. COURTROOM --
Holt holds up the CARD baring the Virginia state seal.
HOLT
Major. Please read aloud what's
inscribed here.
The Major positions his reading glasses.

MAJOR SMITH
Sic semper tyrannis.

HOLT
Can you translate?

MAJOR SMITH
Of course. "Thus always for tyrants."

HOLT
Are these words familiar to you?

MAJOR SMITH
Indeed. Booth yelled them after he
butchered our President.

HOLT
And you found the same -- just an
hour later -- in her daughter's

bedroom next to a photo of the
assassin himself?
54.

MAJOR SMITH
Like a shrine, sir.

AIKEN
That's preposterous. Sic semper
tyrannis is the state motto of
Virginia. This is hardly proof of a
shrine to Booth.

General Hunter interjects with contempt.

GENERAL HUNTER
No more proof is needed, Colonel.

Aiken is stunned silent.

HOLT
Major Smith, please tell us what
happened next.

MAJOR SMITH
As I was fixin' to take the Surratts
down to headquarters for questioning,
I heard a commotion outside...

...The sound of several men SHOUTING.

INT. SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE - FOYER -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Major Smith draws his gun before opening the back door
Lewis Payne (Booth's TALL ASSOCIATE, who attacked the
Secretary of State) is standing in the doorway.

Payne is sweating profusely -- like the fugitive he is --
with PICKAXE in hand. He is surrounded by TWO SOLDIERS.

SOLDIER #1
We found him sneaking around outside.

PAYNE
I told these imbeciles a lady inside
asked me to dig a gutter for her.

MAJOR SMITH
At this time of night?

PAYNE
In the morning. I just wanted to
know what time I should start.
Major Smith turns to Anna, who is watching from the doorway.

MAJOR SMITH
Is this true?

Anna says nothing. Major Smith calls into the PARLOR.

MAJOR SMITH (CONT'D)
Mrs. Surratt. Come here a moment.

Major Smith spots BLOODSTAINS on the back of Payne's sleeve.
He takes the pickaxe from his hand.
55.

MAJOR SMITH (CONT'D
Did you hire this gentleman to do a
job for you?

MARY
Absolutely not. I've never seen him
before in all my life.

PRESENT TIME: INT. COURTROOM --
Holt stands beside Lewis Payne at the prisoners' dock

HOLT
Is this man, Lewis Payne, the one
she denied knowing?

MAJOR SMITH
Yes, sir.

HOLT
The same man, who has confessed to
boarding at the Surratt's several
times -- prior to daggerin' the
Secretary of State and his kin.

MAJOR SMITH
Yes.

HOLT
Thank you, Major. Nothing further

Holt sits down triumphantly. Aiken rises.

AIKEN
Are you aware Mr. Payne boarded at
the Surratt's under an alias, claiming
to be a Baptist minister from
Baltimore named Wood?

MAJOR SMITH
That's what she claimed.

AIKEN
Supposing it was the truth. Supposing
Mrs. Surratt simply failed that night
to recognize Wood, the preacher, in
the guise of Payne, the ditch digger.

MAJOR SMITH
Not possible. He stood barely two
paces in front of her.

Aiken pulls a LETTER from his briefcase.

AIKEN
Your honor, I present the court with
a notarized letter from Dr. Sanford
Wilkerson, a well respected
optometrist in town.

Aiken presents the letter to General Hunter.
56.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Mary Surratt has been a patient under
his care for the past six years,
suffering from severe presbyopia --
more commonly known as farsightedness.

General Hunter examines the letter. But not before having
to put on a pair of READING GLASSES himself.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Major Smith, it was late at night.
The defendant was dressed for sleep.
Isn't it possible she merely had
trouble seeing him?

MAJOR SMITH
Well, I uh..

AIKEN
A simple yes or no.

MAJOR SMITH
Yes, it's possible...I suppose.

AIKEN
So, it's also possible you -- or
rather we -- might also be wrongfully
accusing her of disloyalty too?

Major Smith holds up the daguerreotypes.

MAJOR SMITH
I_think these more than indicate her
allegiances, Colonel.

AIKEN
Have you not seen the like in stores
around town?

MAJOR SMITH
Yes, of course, but...

_ AIKEN
So, do you intend to arrest me too?

Aiken presents to the Court an identical set.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
What's next? Roun ing up everyone
whose name rhymes with General Lee?

Several laugh aloud, including Baker and Catherine.

MAJOR SMITH
Course not.

AIKEN
Then I dare say, we ought to presume
the accused is innocent unless we
have proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
(MORE )
57.

AIKEN (CONT'D)

(a beat)
A thirst for vengeance, Major, is
not enough to avenge this crime.

Even Hamilton has to admire Aiken's commanding presence....
INT. REVERDY JOHNSON'S HOME -- LATER THAT EVENING
Reverdy Johnson is eating his supper ALONE.

The doorbell rings. A STEWARD goes to answer the door.
Reverdy calls out.

REVERDY JOHNSON
I'll take the transcript in here.

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.
Sure you don't want me to read it
aloud?

Reverdy instantly recognizes the voice, looks up. It's
STANTON. He hands Reverdy the transcript.

STANTON
You're associate is putting up quite
a spirited defense. Reminds me of a
lawyer I faced 35 years ago.

REVERDY JOHNSON
He learned to fight in your army.

STANTON
Our young men certainly have been
through four years of hell.

REVERDY JOHNSON
And we older ones better ensure it
was worth the fight.

STANTON
Reverdy, you've done as much for our
nation as anyone I know.

| REVERDY JOHNSON
Feeling's mutual, Ed.

STANTON
Don't you think it's time us war
horses called a truce?

REVERDY JOHNSON
Not if you insist on staging this
abomination.

STANTON
What you consider an 'abomination'
will do more to keep the peace than
any paper treaty could.

REVERDY JOHNSON
How'd you convince yourself of that?
58.

STANTON
Because it will deter the South from
conspiring again. And discourage
the North from seeking revenge.

REVERDY JOHNSON
What about the rule of law?

STANTON
For God's sake, we've never known an
enemy like this. They enjoy our
freedom at the same time they plot
to destroy us. Your actions only
serve to aid them -- by eroding our
unity and diminishing our resolve.

REVERDY JOHNSON
By abandoning our laws we become
just like them.

Stanton begins to leave.

STANTON

You may prefer eating alone, Senator
But do you really want the Colonel
doing so the rest of his life?

qa beat)
If_he continues this way this case
will destroy him. You know I'm right
about this.

Off Reverdy Johnson taking this in...
BAKER (0.S.)

So, this one time we were surrounded
by a rebel column.

PULL BACK: INT. PRIVATE RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM -- SAME
Aiken is seated at an elegant DINING TABLE surrounded by
friends -- notably Baker and Hamilton. Catherine is across
from Aiken. Baker is mid-story.
BAKER
Their General yells out, "I demand
you surrender immediately !" Well,

Freddie shouts back, "my compliments,
General. But we don't Surrender!"

All eyes are once again on Aiken.

BAKER (CONT'D)
"Hope you said your prayers," the
General replies. "Cause they're 400
of us. And only 100 of you!"

Aiken pretends not to revel in the attention.

BAKER (CONT'D)
"Heck, we've got less than that,"
Freddie hollers back

(MORE )
59.

BAKER (CONT'D)
"But we don't surrender. So, shut
up and come get some." And with
that, Freddie pulls down his pants
and bares his ass.

FEMALE GUEST
No, he didn't.

BAKER
As the moon is my witness.

Laughter.

FEMALE GUEST #2
So, did they come?

Hamilton jealously glares at his date.

BAKER

Six times. And each time the General
shouts out, "I won't ask you again.
Now, surrender at once."

(a beat
"Pray don't," Freddie shouts back.
"For we never surrender!" And then
he blows a tremendous fart in their
direction.

FEMALE GUEST #3
He didn't!
; BAKER ;
His seventh was so deadly it sent
them runnin' for their lives!
The TABLE erupts in laughter.
CATHERINE
Doesn't seem like the Colonel ever
intends to surrender.

BAKER
Only for the right woman.

Baker smiles reassuringly at Catherine.

HAMILTON
Appears the Colonel has surrendered
to one -- she's fair, fit and 45.
AIKEN

I don't see why the Lieutenant insists
on bringing his mother into this.

More laughter. Hamilton seethes. Baker attempts to pacify.

BAKER
Freddie, why don't you tell _us what
your conspirator is really like.
I'm sure we'd all like to know.
60.

FEMALE GUEST #1
fcontemptuously)
I understand she's a Catholic.

FEMALE GUEST #2
Is it true she wears black from head-
to-toe as if she's in mourning?

AIKEN

Perhaps, by papal decree.
HAMILTON

How did you do it, Fred?
AIKEN

How did I do what?

HAMILTON
Destroy that Major on cross like
that? The doctor's letter, the
postcards... You didn't bluff your
way through this one.

As Baker raises his artificial leg --

BAKER
My leg's falling asleep. Let's go
dance.

HAMILTON

You knew what was coming, didn't
you, Fred? Those meetings with the
Surratt girl seem to be paying off.

An awkward silence. Baker glances at Catherine.

BAKER
Are you through, Bill?
(Hamilton says nothing)
Good. Now, let's dance.

Baker rises. The others follow suit. We HOLD ON Aiken and
Catherine -- still seated...

...Gradually, PIANO MUSIC begins to fill the room.
PULL BACK: INT. SALON -- LATER

As Baker is now at a piano, playing/singing, "The Children
of the Battle Field". He has a sonorous voice. But only
Aiken is around to hear it.

BAKER
Upon the Field of Gettysburg
The full moon slowly rose,
She looked, and saw 10,000 brows
All pale in death's repose...

Baker continues singing as Aiken is deep in thought and wine.
Catherine enters the room.
61.
CATHERINE
If I had known it was a wake, I'd
have dressed more appropriately.

Aiken turns to take in Catherine's floral dress.

AIKEN
You're the vision of perfection,
Catherine.

CATHERINE

You lie, pass gas and never surrender
Quite a catch.

a_beat)
Why defend her, Freddie?
AIKEN
Not you too, Catherine.
CATHERINE

Is it because of Senator Johnson? I
know your father and he were very
close. But you don't owe it to either

of them.
AIKEN

Of course not.
CATHERINE

Does it have to do with Anna Surratt?
Aiken is taken aback.

AIKEN
Bill is an ass.

CATHERINE
I understand she's very beautiful.

AIKEN
Catherine, please.

CATHERINE
I accepted not hearing from you for
18 months. The front must've been
horrible. But I will not accept
our silence on why you're defending
er.

AIKEN
I don't know.
(off her skepticism)
Honestly, Catherine. I don't.

Catherine can see Aiken means it. A beat.

CATHERINE
Just one more thing.
62.

AIKEN
You're the one who doesn't
"surrender". What? What do you
need to know?

CATHERINE
Does the Colonel still remember how
to dance?

They exchange looks.

He holds out his hand. She takes it. Baker starts to pray
a slow waltz on the piano. With each turn across the floor,
the distance between Aiken and Catherine becomes less.

Aiken inhales Catherine's scent as she grasps his shoulder.
His eyes begin to fall to half-staff. His head rests against
hers. It looks as if Aiken is finally going to surrender.
Suddenly, he pulls away.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
What is it?

AIKEN

There's something I need to ask you.
CATHERINE

Of course, Freddie. You can ask me

anything?
Off Catherine waiting expectantly...
AIKEN (0.S.)
I want you to wear this in court
today.
PULL BACK: INT. MARY'S CELL -- NEXT MORNING

As Aiken presents Mary with Catherine's floral DRESS. Mary
doesn't take it.

MARY
I want the truth from you this time.

Aiken knows exactly what she's after.

AIKEN
Anna never went missing.

MARY
She's been helping you all along?

Aiken nods.
MARY (CONT'D)

How could you lie to me about such a
thing?

AIKEN
I needed to know the truth about
your son.
63.

MARY
Nothing they do to me could compare
to the torture of not knowing my
daughter was ok.

AIKEN
I'm sorry.
Aiken pulls out NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS from his briefcase.
MARY

Please leave.

AIKEN (CONT'D.

(reads from a clipping
"Mrs. Surratt looks no less masculine
than the male prisoners on trial --
removing any doubt a woman like her
could be capable of such a crime."

(re. other clippings)
The others are less kin

Aiken holds out the dress. Mary refuses it.

MARY
It matters none to me what they think.

AIKEN
It matters to me. This country has
never executed a woman. We need
those Generals to begin seeing their
own wives in you.

Mary grimaces momentarily, but conceals it from Aiken.

MARY

You speak of womanhood with such
reverence, Mr. Aiken. Yet, we aren't
trusted enough to vote, while a former
slave now can as long as he has $250.

(heavy Southern drawl)
Yes, I'm certain y'all would prefer
I acted like a good Southern lady.
Met my fate in that pretty dress
with a painted face. But, I'd prefer
to act naturally . And take the
consequences like a man.

AIKEN
Please. Ma'am. Wear the dress,
smile at those Generals and pray
they show you some mercy.

Mary holds a beat. She starts undressing in front of Aiken.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

MARY
Just obeying orders, Colonel.
64.

She drops her black dress to the floor. Starts unlacing her
corset. She is now standing in a calf-length chemise. She
slips off her pantalettes, and tosses it into the bucket.

MARY (CONT'D)
Come now, Freddie, don't be shy.
Surely, you've undressed a woman.

; AIKEN
You're insane.

Mary presses up against Aiken, seductively.

MARY
I'm just showing you how I'd please
those Generals.

AIKEN
Stop it!

Aiken pushes Mary to the ground, just as her son did at the
boardinghouse. But this time Mary doesn't get up.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Ma'am?
(no response)
Ma'am. Are you alright?

Aiken spots her chemise in the bucket, stained BLOOD RED.
Aiken calls out.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Call a doctor.

Mary remains crumpled, clutching her belly.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Call a doctor. NOw!

..A door marked: SECRETARY of WAR
PULL BACK: INT. WAR DEPT. - STANTON'S OFFICE -- LATER
An AIDE intercepts Aiken outside Secretary Stanton's door.

STANTON'S AIDE
I'm sorry, sir. No one sees Mr.
Stanton without an appointment.

Joseph Holt emerges from inside.

HOLT.
Good morning, Colonel. Perhaps I
can be of assistance.

AIKEN
Fyou can arrange a meeting for me
wat the Secretary. My client is
not well
65.

HOLT
So I heard. Just a touch of the
woman's curse, thank goodness. She'll
be well enough to continue with her
trial within a few days. In the
meantime, we'll pursue our case
against the other Conspirators.

AIKEN
My client requires a proper meal and
some fresh air. Otherwise, I can
not assure you she'll be fit for
trial. Which is why I must see the
Secretary -- immediately.

HOLT
Unfortunately, he's quite busy right
now. Perhaps, you'd take a turn
with me instead.

Aiken hesitates.

HOLT (CONT'D)
Please, Colonel.

Aiken reluctantly follows Holt outside.
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE -- CONTINUOUS

As Aiken and Holt continue their conversation across swampy
Pennsylvania Avenue. The WHITE HOUSE looms in the background.

HOLT.
One of the Conspirators refuses to
be guarded by a Negro. Another will
only eat his mother's cooking. We
can't accommodate every whim.

AIKEN
I'm merely asking you stop treating
her like a savage.

HOLT
How dare you accuse US of savagery?

An AMPUTEE crosses in front of Holt and Aiken's path.

HOLT (CONT'D)

Have you forgotten how our own were
treated by the rebels? Thousands
starved to death at Andersonville.
Not to mention the horrors for those
held at Libby and Liggett's Farm.

AIKEN
It hardly enhances our cause to act
as the enemy would.

HOLT
Security demands it.
66.

AIKEN
Mary Surratt is not a present danger
I assure you.

HOLT
Can you say the same about her
daughter?

AIKEN

Anna Surratt? Of course. But I'm
sure you've been tracking her every
move.

HOLT
Not well enough. She disappeared
last night.
AIKEN
What? Where is she?
HOLT
I thought you might know.

AIKEN
I have no idea.

HOLT
Then I can only conclude she does
not wish to be found -- much like

her brother.
Both men pass inside the prestigious CENTURY CLUB.
INT. CENTURY CLUB - STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS
As Aiken and Holt continue up the Club's GRAND STAIRCASE.
HOLT
...Counselor, I appreciate your zeal
in defending your client. But I
hardly think it prudent to do so at
your own peril.
AIKEN
"Peril"?

HOLT
You exhibit a bright future, dear
boy. Don't dim it by mounting
unnecessary campaigns.

AIKEN
You offer me no other alternative.

Holt freezes, makes certain NO ONE else is listening.
; HOLT
I think I know a way to save both
your client -- and yourself.

A beat.
67.

HOLT (CONT'D)
I'll deny ever telling you this.
Understood?

Off Aiken nodding...
EXT. COURTYARD, U.S. ARSENAL PRISON -- LATE AFTERNOON
A beautiful late Spring day.

Aiken spots Mary across the open-air courtyard. She has
made a swift recovery -- exercising in the sunlight, her
arms now free of chains. She is wearing the dress given to
her by Aiken, the plunging neckline tempered by a shawl.

Father Walter passes Aiken, after having prayed with Mary.

AIKEN
Good Morning, Father.

FATHER WALTER
Colonel.

Aiken approaches Mary tentatively.

MARY

You should've pushed me down a month
ago, if that's what it took to spell
me from that cage. Feel that sun.
Now, all I need is a few boiled
oysters with Spanish olives.

(giddy ) .
Your mama ever boil oysters for you
Frederick?

Aiken is taken aback by Mary's use of his first name.
AIKEN

No, ma'am. I never had the good
fortune to taste my mother's cooking.

MARY
She doesn't cook?
AIKEN
She passed when I was born.
MARY,
I feel for your loss -- and hers.

(a beat
Some day I'll make oysters for you --
with Spanish olives, of course. You
must never eat 'em without the olives.

AIKEN
I look forward to it.

Aiken struggles for the right words.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Mary. I, uh...
68.

MARY
Young man, I don't believe I've seen
you ata loss for words.

Aiken comes right out with it.

AIKEN
Do you know where your son is hiding?

MARY
(laughs)
My Johnnie! 'Course not!

AIKEN
The government believes you do.
That you're in contact.

MARY
From here?
AIKEN
Ma'am, you need to tell us where he
is.
MARY
"US!" Whose side are you on?
AIKEN
I'm trying to save your life.
MARY

By suggesting I trade my son's life
for my own. Seems more like you're
trying to save yourself.

AIKEN
How dare you! You think I asked to
defend you?

MARY
"Course not. But every time you
walk out those gates something pulls
ou back inside. Well, if you're
ooking to slip out the back door
yout have to unlock it yourself.
ecause I have no idea where my son

is hiding.
AIKEN

How about your daughter?
MARY,

You've already played that card, Mr.

Aiken. Now, if you please, I wish
to enjoy the rest of this glorious
gay. There may not be many more
eft.

Mary resumes her exercises.

AIKEN (0.S.)
Are you absolutely certain?
69.
PULL BACK: INT. CAPITOL -- REVERDY'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING
As Aiken now confers with Reverdy Johnson.

REVERDY JOHNSON
The Secretary assures me they don't
have her.

AIKEN
Anna chose to flee? Why would she
do that?

REVERDY JOHNSON
Perhaps she's as guilty as her
brother.

AIKEN
Do you believe that?

REVERDY JOHNSON
It matters none. Fact is with two
children abandoning Mrs. Surratt,
it'll only be seen one way -- their
mother must be guilty.

AIKEN
I think Mary may be innocent.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Is that so? Well, "Mary" and "Anna"
they're my concern now. Your wish
is granted, Fred. I'm taking you
off the case.

Reverdy rises, heads for the door.
INT. AIKEN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
Aiken chases after Reverdy.

AIKEN
But you said I had to prove her
guilty.

REVERDY JOHNSON
You haven't proven she's not.

AIKEN
So, you don't think I'm up to the
task of defending her?

REVERDY JOHNSON
Quite the contrary. I just think
it's best for all concerned that I
take over from here.

AIKEN
But_your presence in that courtroom
will antagonize those generals. You
said so yourself.
70.

REVERDY JOHNSON
I can manage.

But Aiken soon realizes Reverdy isn't only referring to the
case as he's just followed his boss inside the --

WATER CLOSET --
Embarrassed, Aiken quickly exits. Reverdy closes the door

REVERDY JOHNSON (0.S.)
(calls out)
Few will soon forget on whose side
you Fought here, Fred. Trust me
it's a lonely place to be.

AIKEN
(calls back)
Sir, a man must be willing to walk
on faith alone. You said so yourself.

REVERDY JOHNSON
This habit of quoting me back to me
is most irritating.

Flush. Reverdy reemerges from the water closet.
REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
You've got your mother's conviction.
And your father's annoying habits.
Reverdy returns to his office with Aiken in tow...
INT. REVERDY'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
AIKEN

With all due respect, I never knew
my mother. And my father only through
al

his books. So, the only bad bits
I picked up are from you -- sir.
(a beat)

Mary Surratt is entitled to a defense.
So, I shall defend her.

Reverdy thinks on it.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Are you sure you want this?

AIKEN
Unfortunately. Yes.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Very well, Fred.
(another beat)

So, tell me, how do you intend to
convince the Generals she's innocent
after they hear she was carrying a
package from Booth -- just hours
efore he murdered Lincoln?
71.

AIKEN
According to her daughter, she was
merely returning a favor to Booth.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Dr. Mudd did Booth a favor by fixin'
his broken leg. Now, he's facing
life in prison. Edward Spangler
held Booth's horse outside Ford's
Theater and is looking at hard labor
So, don't do your client any "favors"
by offering that as a defense.

AIKEN
What do you suggest I do?

REVERDY JOHNSON
If it's John Surratt they want, then
present him to those Generals on a
platter. It's the only chance she's
got.

AIKEN
How? I haven't a clue where he is.
And if all the resources of the
Government can't find him, I hardly
think I will by hour's end.

REVERDY JOHNSON
I don't mean in oth -- in spirit.
You must prove to them her son is
responsible -- not her.

AIKEN
Mary won't like it. She insists on
leaving him out of it.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Better to hate you alive, than love
you from the grave.

A long beat as we CUT TO --
FULL SCREEN: on an ARTIST's SKETCH of the next WITNESS.
PULL BACK: INT. U.S. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTROOM -- NEXT DAY

As_we reveal the SKETCH is being drawn by a member of the
Military Commission -- GENERAL LEWIS WALLACE. (Note: General
Wallace is perpetually sketching throughout the trial.)

HOLT
Mr. Lloyd, you are employed by Mary
Surratt, are you not?

JOHN LLOYD, 54, rotund and ruddy-cheeked, wears a Panama
hat, white suit and as many folds on the back of his red
neck as around his waist.

LLOYD
Yes, sir. I run a tavern started by
her late husband many years ago.
72.

Aiken looks over at Mary. She looks away.

HO
On the afternoon President Lincoln
was assassinated, did Mrs. Surratt
pay you a visit?

LLOYD

Yes, sir. Indeed. In the company

of Lt. Louis Wiechmann.
EXT. MARYLAND COUNTRYSIDE -- TAVERN - AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
Mary and Wiechmann ride atop a BUGGY along a COUNTRY ROAD.
A wooden TAVERN sits atop a rolling plain. Wiechmann guides
the buggy up to the PORCH as Lloyd rushes out to greet them.
PRESENT TIME: INT. COURTROOM --

Holt continues his line of questioning.

HOLT
Mrs. Surratt gave you a package, did
she not?

LLOYD

Yes, sir. C'rect, sir. A small
package, wrapped in newspaper...

EXT. TAVERN -- AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
As Mary hands the WRAPPED PACKAGE to Lloyd on his back porch.
PRESENT TIME: INT. COURTROOM --
HOLT
Did she tell you where the package
came from?
LLOYD
She told me it came from John Wilkes
Booth.
The Gallery begins to stir.
HOLT

From 'Booth!' And what exactly did
she give you?

AIKEN
Objection!

HOLT
Objection?

AIKEN

Yes. There's no proof the defendant
knew herself. He just testified the
package was wrapped.

HOLT
She damn well handed it to him.
73.

AIKEN
Mr. Booth was friends with John
Surratt -- not the defendant.

Mary glares at Aiken.
GENERAL HUNTER

Objection overruled. The witness
will answer the question.

HOLT

Mr. Lloyd, what was inside?
LLOYD

Field glasses, sir.
HOLT

Are these the ones?

Holt holds up a pair of BINOCULARS. Lloyd inspects them.

LLOYD
'Xactly.
HOLT
Did she give you any instructions?
LLOYD
Sir?
HOLT

Instructions, Mr. Lloyd. Instructions
which might affect this trial?

The QUESTION puzzles both Aiken and Mary. Lloyd reacts to
"instruction" as though it were a CODE.

LLOYD
Oh, yes...yes, sir.
(as if memorized)
She told me: "Lloyd, get those
shooting irons ready. There'll be
par ties here tonight who'll call for
them."

MARY
You liar!

Mary screams out. General Hunter slams his gavel.
GENERAL HUNTER
Control yourself, ma'am. Such
outbursts will only prejudice your
case.
Mary guffaws.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
You find that amusing?
74.

MARY
I just don't see how I could possibly
further prejudice this case.

GENERAL HUNTER
Counselor, control your client!

Aiken turns to Mary. But he, too, can barely contain his
own amusement at Mary's quip. They share a quick smile.

HOLT
"Shooting irons!' To what was she
referring?

LLOYD

Army rifles, sir. Hidden in the
joists above my storeroom.

HOLT
By whom?

LLOYD
By her son, John. Six weeks earlier

Lloyd glares over at Mary.

HOLT
And were these weapons called for as
per the defendant's instructions?

LLOYD
Yes, sir. Around midnight, sir, the
night of the assassination. By two
men on horses. One of â€˜em I'd seen
before...

Lloyd points at DAVID HEROLD, 22, inside the prisoners' dock.
Herold bows his head.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
...The other kept his mount. He was
a stranger to me, and seemed to have
injured his leg.

EXT. TAVERN -- MIDNIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Booth, with a broken ankle, remains atop his HORSE outside
Lloyd's tavern. His identity is concealed behind his collar

Herold dismounts from his ride and follows Lloyd inside.

LLOYD (V.O.
I_fetched the rifles and field
glasses, supposing they were the
parties Mrs. Surratt had meant.

Herold returns moments later with the SUPPLIES in hand.

LLOYD (V.0.)
The two of â€˜em rode off so fast,
they could've outrun creation and
give it two mile the start.
75.
Booth and Herold race into the night.
PRESENT TIME: INT. COURTROOM --

HOLT.
Thank you, Mr. Lloyd. Thank_you
very much. Your witness, Colonel.

Holt returns to his seat, a smug grin on his face.

AIKEN
Mr. Lloyd, you just testified Lt.
Wiechmann accompanied the defendant
that afternoon?

LLOYD
That's right.

AIKEN
So then I can correctly assume he'd
also testify to having heard Mrs.
Surratt's instructions to you?

LLOYD
No.

AIKEN
"No"? But they were seated side by
side.

LLOYD

She took me out by the wood pile and
told me out of earshot.

_ AIKEN ;
You're saying no one else heard this
conversation? Just you and her?

LLOYD
That's just the way it happened.
Sir.

AIKEN
Of course it is.

Aiken and Holt exchange glances.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
When did you first learn the President
had been assassinated, Mr. Lloyd?

LLOYD
No one will ever forget the moment
they heard. I was told early the
next morning by a Captain Cottingham,
who was searching for the assassins.

AIKEN
No doubt, you were most upset!
76.

LLOYD
Indeed. I got myself right smart in
liquor the remainder of the day.

AIKEN
In fact, you're right smart most
days. Aren't you, mate?

; LLOYD
I enjoy a round or two.

AIKEN
You shared a few with the defendant's
late husband, isn't that right?

LLOYD

Every now and again.
AIKEN

You were fond of him, weren't you?
LLOYD

He was always good for a laugh.
AIKEN

And for overlooking a debt.
LLOYD

We had an understanding.
AIKEN

Which you and the defendant don't.

In fact, the day she and Mr. Wiechmann
visited the tavern, Mrs. Surratt
inquired about a significant sum you
owed her late husband. Isn't that
correct?

LLOYD
Yeah, so?

AIKEN
So, you have a financial stake in
the outcome of this trial.

LLOYD
If you're suggesting I aim to profit
from our President's death, I've got
a good mind to put you in the ground.

AIKEN
Your words, Mr. Lloyd, not mine.

Lloyd stands up as if he's going to attack Aiken.

HOLT
Objection! This courageous witness
is a former policeman. He deserves
our gratitude, not unfounded
accusations.
77.

GENERAL HUNTER
Sustained. Mr. Aiken, show the
witness some respect.

AIKEN
Yes, General. Thank you, Mr. Lloyd.
We're all so indebted to you.
(a beat)
May I continue, your honor?

General Hunter nods.

GENERAL HUNTER
Please be seated, Mr. Lloyd.

Lloyd does as told. Reverdy enters the back of the courtroom.

AIKEN
Mr. Lloyd, when this Captain
Cottingham visited you after the
assasSination, did he ask anything
in reference to the assassins?

LLOYD
He asked if any parties had passed
through. Naturally, I told them
about the two I knew.

Aiken withdraws a document from his files.

AIKEN
According to this witness report,
you didn't actually inform him until
wo days later.

LLOYD
I was frightened is all.

AIKEN
Perhaps, you feared you might be
considered an accessory.

LLOYD
I told him it was through the Surratts
that I'd gotten myself in such a
difficulty.

AIKEN
John Surratt to be more precise.
After all, he's the one who concealed
those "shooting irons" inside your
tavern months earlier. Not you.

LLOYD
That's right.

AIKEN
Perhaps, he threatened to foreclose
on your tavern if you refused.

Lloyd looks confused. Mary leans forward in her chair
78.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Were those John Surratt's
"instructions" to you?

LLOYD
(getting Aiken's ist)
Yes, exactly. He said he'd take it
away from me if I didn't do what he
said.

HOLT
Objection. There's no evidence John
Surratt did anything of the sort.
And since Mr. Surratt's whereabouts
are unknown at this time --

AIKEN
-- As the General said, Mr. Surratt's
absence from this proceeding is Mr.
Surratt's problem.

By quoting Hunter's own words, he's forced his hand --

GENERAL HUNTER
Objection overruled.

AIKEN
So, if John Surratt could implicate
a dear friend of his father's, like
yourself, who's to say he didn't do
the same to his own mother as well.

Mary lunges at the rail.

MARY

Stop this. Stop this right now.
HOLT

Objection.
AIKEN

Or that the only crime Mary Surratt
may be guilty of is having given
birth to her son, John.

MARY
How dare you! You have no right.

General Hunter bangs his gavel repeatedly.

HOLT
Objection, your honor. This is an
outrage.

GENERAL HUNTER
Objection sustained. Mr. Aiken, I'm
warning you.

AIKEN
But sir --
79.

GENERAL HUNTER
That will be all, counselor

One of the MEMBERS of the COMMISSION points to his WATCH.
General Hunter takes it as a CUE and abruptly changes course.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
S you know, tonight marks
Was ington's celebration honoring
our soldiers. We shall adjourn now
to prepare our faces for this
evening's festivities. Mr. Lloyd,
you may step down.

Lloyd exits the WITNESS BOX, very satisfied with himself.
Aiken says to Lloyd under his breath --

AIKEN
So, what did they promise you?

an HOLT
Objection, your honor!

GENERAL HUNTER AIKEN
Counselor, control Bet a case of whiskey is
yourself. all it took.

Aiken and Lloyd begin to square off as if to fight.

GENERAL HUNTER
Control yourself. Or I will hold
you in contempt.

A BAILIFF steps between Aiken and Lloyd, quickly escorting
the latter outside. General Hunter slams his gavel.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)

We'll reconvene promptly at 09:00.
(to Aiken)

And when we do, young man, you'd
better comport yourself in a more
appropriate manner. Or else you'll
find yourself in the brig alongside
the others.

Hunter slams his gavel. Holt looks at Aiken as if to say:
"you're playing with fire." Mary glares at him with contempt.

Reverdy Johnson looks distressed for Aiken. There's no
turning back now.

. FIREWORKS explode into the NIGHT SKY.
PULL BACK: EXT. WASHINGTON CITY -- NIGHT

The NATION'S CAPITAL consumed in CELEBRATION, its MONUMENTS
bathed in light. We HOLD ON a BANNER that reads:

The Century Club
Honors
OUR FIGHTING HEROES
80.

PULL BACK: INT. CENTURY CLUB - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

GUESTS pass beneath the banner on their way to the grand
ballroom upstairs. WALTZ music filters down from above.

The Century Club is filled with the POWERS-THAT-BE and POWERS-
TO-BE, mostly attired in their finest military dress.

Aiken enters quite dapper in his dress whites. Eager for a
festive night-on-the-town. Catherine is on his arm.

They pass the Club Steward, OTIS, on his way upstairs.

AIKEN/CATHERINE
Good evening, Otis.

OTIS
Evenin', Colonel. Miss Morgan.

Suddenly, Otis' expression changes from welcome to alarm.

OTIS (CONT'D)
Just a minute, Colonel Aiken. Can I
have a word?

Otis ushers Aiken out of Catherine's earshot.

OTIS (CONT'D)
They! re tellin' me I ain't allowed
et you in there.

AIKEN
What are you talking about?

As Catherine waits patiently, she spots a BULLETIN BOARD
posted nearby.

DEAR MEMBERS:

.Reverend Peale has agreed to.
.Construction will begin on.

Finally SETTLING on:

.The membership of MR. FREDERICK AIKEN
has been rescinded effective immediately
as a result of conduct unbecoming
The Century Club.

E.M, Stanton
Chairman, Board of Governors

Suddenly, the sound of LAUGHTER -- Hamilton, with beauty in
tow, and Baker arriving. Aiken turns to Baker.

AIKEN. (CONT'D)
Nick, would you please take Catherine
inside for me.

BAKER
Is everything alright?
81.

AIKEN
Everything's fine. I'll join you as
soon as I can. Go ahead, darling.
Enjoy the evening. Gentleman.

Aiken turns and heads for the door. Baker extends his arm.

BAKER
Even on one I can outdance him.

CATHERINE
And one less foot for me to step on.
Another night, Nick.

Catherine kisses Baker on the cheek, and heads for the door.

OTIS
Shall I call you a carriage, Miss
Morgan?

CATHERINE

Thank you, Otis.
Hamilton calls out.
HAMILTON
Sure you don't want to join us
Catherine?

She turns and glares at Hamilton. And heads out the door
without answering.

EXT. CENTURY CLUB -- MOMENTS LATER

Catherine exits. Otis motions for a carriage to pull forward.
Aiken suddenly appears.

AIKEN
I've got it, Otis.

Aiken helps Catherine into the CARRIAGE.

CATHERINE
I saw the announcement.

AIKEN
I'll take care of it in the morning.
I'm sorry about this evening.
Tears begin to fill her eyes.

CATHERINE
I'm sorry too.

She slips off her engagement ring and returns it to Aiken.
The Carriage rides off. Aiken is now the outsider, and ALONE.

. A flash of LIGHTNING.
82.
PULL BACK: EXT. WASHINGTON CITY - STREET -- LATER

As BOLTS now light up the sky, replacing the fireworks.
They illuminate Aiken, who waiks alone in a torrential RAIN.

A THUNDERCLAP echoes overhead. A UNION BAND marches past
joyfully playing "Yankee Doodle" in the downpour.

Aiken is forlorn and soaking wet. He spots a PUB ahead --
THE BLUE GOOSE & OYSTER BAR -- and quickly ducks inside.

INT. BLUE GOOSE SALOON & OYSTER BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken enters the pub, which is filled with a much ROUGHER
CROWD than the upper crust at the Century Club gala.

All eyes seem to follow him as he removes his drenched Union
coat, and settles on a stool at the end of the bar.

AIKEN
Whiskey.

BARTENDER
Got none.

AIKEN

How 'bout that bottle over there?
Aiken points to a WHISKEY BOTTLE, three-quarters full.

BARTENDER
I don't want no trouble, Colonel.

He gestures to the PATRONS, all fixed on Aiken. A BLOCK-
HEAD leans in from Aiken's right, glaring at Aiken's uniform.

BLOCK-HEAD
(southern accent)
Yanks ain't welcome here.

Several MORE TOUGHS now circle behind. There's no mistaking
now this is a Rebel bar.

Nervously, Aiken rises to leave. A BARREL-CHEST blocks him.
BARREL - CHEST
You're the one defending that Surratt
women, aren't you?
Aiken nods as he prepares for the worst.

BARTENDER
Why didn't you say so?

Suddenly, the entire pub descends upon Aiken. But instead
of attacking him, they're hailing Aiken like a hero.

HOLD ON: Aiken's expression registering his DISMAY.
CUT TO:
83.

INT. AIKEN'S RESIDENCE -- A SHORT TIME LATER
Aiken stumbles home dripping wet and drunk.

He crosses inside his modest flat -- legal briefs, army
mementoes and dirty clothes are strewn about.

Framed DAGUERREOTYPES fill his mantel, including one of a
young woman (Aiken's MOTHER). A closer look reveals she's
inside a coffin, her death portrait. Another image is of a
young Aiken with his very formal-looking FATHER. A portrait
of PRESIDENT LINCOLN is the last photo shown.

Aiken's windows are also broken like Anna's -- a ROCK pile
is on the sill. One is inscribed: DIE REBEL DIE.

Aiken begins removing his soggy clothes to prepare for sleep --
suddenly, a HAND grabs his bare shoulder from behind.

Aiken whirls, takes the attacker's feet out from under him,
knocks him to the ground, and pins him...pins HER!

FAMILIAR VOICE (0.S.)
Frederick, stop. It's me.

As we reveal ANNA SURRATT, with Aiken straddling her, one
hand to her throat, another raised to strike.

AIKEN
What the hell.

Aiken, now suddenly sober, relaxes his grip.

ANNA
She's very beautiful.
(Off Aiken's confusion)
I saw you go in your club tonight.

Aiken rolls off of Anna.
AIKEN
Anna. They think you're as guilty
as your brother. Where have you
been?
A long beat. Then softly --

ANNA
You still want to know where he is?

Another beat.
AIKEN
You don't have to do this. No one
should have to choose between their
mother and their brother

ANNA
I found out how...

Aiken cuts her off.
84.

Please. I never should've put you
in this position. I'm so sorry.

ANNA
Can you save my mother without him?
(no reply)
Can you, Fred?

A long pause.

AIKEN
Probably not.

Anna's eyes fill with tears. Aiken desperately wants to
comfort her. She desperately wants to be comforted. Instead,
she hands him a NOTE and flees. Off Aiken's turmoil...

...A splash of WATER.
PULL BACK: INT. CATHEDRAL -- EARLY MORNING MASS

As we reveal a BABY being BAPTIZED. Proud PARENTS and
GRANDPARENTS surround a PRIEST performing the ritual bath.

Aiken watches the tender scene from a rear pew.

The Priest, his identity still obscured, passes the Infant
off to an ASSOCIATE, then exits through a side door

Aiken follows behind.

AIKEN (0.S.)
I'm told you know the whereabouts of
John Surratt.

PULL BACK: INT. CHAPEL ANNEX -- MOMENTS LATER

The Priest's identity is now revealed -- FATHER JACOB WALTER
(the Cleric twice shown visiting Mary in jaity) Aiken shows
him the note on Anna's stationary with Walter's name on it.

FATHER WALTER
You've been misinformed.

AIKEN
I need to see him right away.

FATHER WALTER
Not possible, Colonel. As I told
Miss Surratt, I can only pass along
a message. We believe it safer for
everyone concerned.

AIKEN
'we'?
Father Walter pinches his cleric's COLLAR.
FATHER WALTER

A few of us have chosen to provide
him sanctuary.
85.

AIKEN
You don't seem troubled by your
choice.

FATHER WALTER
You prefer he, too, be crucified by
this mob?

AIKEN
"Crucified'!

Aiken's loud exclamation brings one of Father Walter's
ASSOCIATES to the CHAPEL DOOR. Aiken lowers his voice.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
John Surratt is hardly the 'Prince
of Peace.' He's accused of murder
and treason. Concealing him is not
only immoral, Father, its illegal.

FATHER WALTER
(clutching a Bible)
My laws are written here, counselor.
My allegiance to God.

AIKEN
Forgive me, Father, but that's a
bunch of cock-and-bull. The Bible
bears just as many interpretations
as does anything else. It does not
give you the authority to decide
right from wrong.

FATHER WALTER
You prefer Stanton having the power
instead?

A beat.

FATHER WALTER (CONT'D)
I will pass along a_message, Colonel.
But John Surratt, alone, Will choose
whether or not to turn himself in.

Off Father Walter...

 

GENERAL HUNTER (0.S. -)
Colonel Aiken, do you wish to call a
witness in defense of the accused?

PULL BACK: INT. PRISON - COURTROOM -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

The courtroom is sweltering like an inferno. Many fan
themselves with little relief.

AIKEN
Yes, your honor. I do. Will Miss
Anna Surratt please step forward.

Anna Surratt enters the courtroom.
86.

As Anna is seated inside the WITNESS BOX, she gets her first
glimpse of her mother, nearly moving both to tears.

Aiken, sensing Anna is coming apart, steps near. Just as
he's about to say something --

ANNA
resolute)
I'm fine.

As we CUT TO --
EXT. FOREST -- SAME

A flock of GEESE fly over a secluded LOG CABIN, tucked inside
a dense WILDERNESS. A RIVER roars beside.

A MAN in a dark suit wades across the river towards a YOUNG
FISHERMAN casting for SALMON. A closer look reveals the
suited man is a GRAY-HAIRED CLERIC. He bears an ENVELOPE,
which he hands to the Young Fisherman.

A closer look reveals the Young Fisherman is JOHN SURRATT,
as we CUT BACK TO --

INT. COURTROOM -- SAME
Aiken stands beside Anna at the witness box.

AIKEN
Miss Surratt, when is the last time
you saw your brother, John?

ANNA
Monday, the 3rd of April.

Aiken turns to the Commission for emphasis.

AIKEN
Eleven days prior to the
assasSination. Did he say where he
was headed?

She shakes her head.

GENERAL HUNTER
Please answer for the record.

ANNA
He did not. He only told me he had
to leave town.

AIKEN
Miss Surratt, was your brother
involved in a conspiracy to
assassinate President Lincoln and
other members of the Government?

Anna looks at her mother, then looks away.

ANNA
I can't say.
87.

AIKEN
You can't? Or you won't?

ANNA
I don't know if he was involved. I
only know that my mother was not.

Aiken glances at Wiechmann, seated in the gallery.

Anna nods.

AIKEN
According to Lt. Wiechmann, your
mother "welcomed" these prisoners
into her boardinghouse with open
arms.

ANNA
It's not true. He's lying.
(turns to wiechmann)
How could you? She would sit up and
wait for you at night, the same as
for my own brother.

HOLT
Objection.

GENERAL HUNTER
Miss Surratt. You will address this
Commission, not the gallery. Is
that understood?

; AIKEN |
Did your mother object to these men
being at the boardinghouse?

ANNA
She said she did not_understand why
strange persons should call there.

AIKEN
Then why didn't she refuse them?
ANNA
She Supposed their object was to see
my brother.
AIKEN
John Surratt?
ANNA
Yes.
AIKEN

So_she_was merely treating them
politely as any lady would?

ANNA
Yes.
88.

AIKEN
What about John Wilkes Booth? Did
she object to him as well?

ANNA
Mr. Booth was not a stranger.

AIKEN
In fact, he was friends with your
brother, John. Was he not?

Mary calls out to Aiken.

MARY
That is enough.

Anna glances at her mother.

AIKEN
Please answer the question, Miss
Surratt.

Anna proceeds, tentatively.

ANNA
I never asked my brother what his
friendship was to Booth.

AIKEN
But the fact remains, Mr. Booth
frequently called on your brother.

ANNA
Yes.

Aiken presents a piece of evidence already presented in court --
the picture called "Morning, Noon and Night"

AIKEN
Does this belong to you?

ANNA
It was given to me by that man
Wiechmann.

AIKEN

But it was you who put the photo of
John Wilkes Booth behind it?

ANNA
Yes. I went to a daguerrean gallery
one day to get a picture taken. I
saw some photographs of Mr. Booth
there, and being acquainted with
him, I bought one, and took it home.

IKEN
Your brother must've been pleased
you thought so highly of his friend.
89.

ANNA
When my brother saw it, he told me
to tear it up and throw it in the
fire. And that if I did not, he
would take it from me.

AIKEN
Why? Why would your brother tell
you to do that?

ANNA
You'll have to ask him.

AIKEN
Thank you, Miss Surratt. That will
be all. Your witness.

He turns to Holt.

HOLT
We have nothing, your honor. The
People view Miss Surratt's situation
with compassion. And can understand
how she'd be moved to conceal her
mother's guilt, even offering up her
own brother as a sacrificial lamb.

ANNA
But I'm telling the truth. My mother
is innocent.

HOLT
The truth is based in fact -- not
emotion.

AIKEN
The truth, sir, is the truth. Not
what you choose to make of it.

GENERAL HUNTER
If there are no further questions
the witness may stand down.

ANNA
You've got to believe me.

GENERAL HUNTER
Please call your next witness, Mr.
Aiken.

Anna remains in the witness box.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
Miss Surratt, you are dismissed.

Anna tentatively begins to leave the witness box. She looks
to her mother. Mary looks back with disappointment.

AIKEN
Your honor, everyone else I wish to
call has either been silenced by
jail or the threat of one.
90.

HAMILTON
(asides to Baker)
Distoyalty surrounds itself with
disloyal friends.

Anna overhears Hamilton on her way to the door

GENERAL HUNTER
I take it then the defense rests.

Aiken glances at Mary. She won't even look at him. Aiken
turns back towards General Hunter -- and nods. Anna holds a
moment at the door, devastated. As she exits, we CUT TO --

...A SALMON flipping for its life inside a WICKER CREEL.
PULL BACK: EXT. FOREST -- DAY

As JOHN SURRATT sits mournfully beside his fishing basket
the opened ENVELOPE in hand, flapping in the wind.

AIKEN (0.S.)
After the most thorough investigation
in our nation's history...

PULL BACK: INT. COURTROOM -- SAME
As Aiken begins his closing argument.

AIKEN
...the government's entire case
against Mary Surratt rests on three
acts alone:

The courtroom is rapt -- Baker, Catherine, even Hamilton.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
1.) That she befriended John Wilkes
Booth and his fellow Conspirators;
2.) That she carried a package from
Booth with "instructions" the day of
the assassination; and
3.) That she failed to recognize
the prisoner, Lewis Payne, at the
time of her arrest.

Aiken rises from his chair.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
By themselves, these three acts
constitute no crime. You, or I,
might've done the same. But the
prosecution insists she did so with
evil intent -- largely on the
testimony of two witnesses: Louis
Wiechmann and John Lloyd.

Aiken glances at WIECHMANN and LLOYD in the Gallery.
91.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Yet, all the facts suggest they should
be on trial. At best, their own
actions undermine their credibility.
At worst, they've done the unspeakable --
gained their freedom by falsely
accusing another of their crime.
(crossing the courtroom)
But let there be no doubt why Mary
Surratt is here today. It is because
of one person: her son, John.
(his back to Mary)
John Surratt invited Booth and his
associates into her home. She did
not. And he hid the rifles and
ammunition inside Lloyd's tavern.
Not her.

Aiken spots Reverdy, who nods his approval.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
If John Surratt was part of this
conspiracy, I hope he receives every
punishment known to man. But if
Mary Surratt can be convicted on
such insufficient evidence, then
none of us is safe.

Aiken pauses in front of Baker and Hamilton.

AIKEN (CONT'D

To preserve the Union, I'd have given
my life. Now, I find myself without
a side. Neither with the North or
against the South. My friends have
become foes -- my enemies, allies.

(looks at Hamilton)
But to abide by our Constitution is
not a question of latitude and
longitude -- North or South. It's
about what kind of nation are we.
One ruled by laws? Or by the fury
of our People?

Aiken examines a picture of Lincoln.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
What enemy should we fear most?
Lincoln was asked. Will it come
from Europe, Africa or Asia? No, he
replied. If we're to be destroyed,
it'll be from within. By failing to
rotect our Constitution and its
aws.

He puts the image of Lincoln back down.

AIKEN (CONT'D
So, if we are willing to die on the
battlefield defending our nation
against a hostile force... then we,
(MORE )
92.

AIKEN foonT'd)
too, must safeguard our founding
principles with our lives.

(a beat)
Above all, we must never sacrifice
our sacred rights -- out of a desire
for revenge -- when so many have

given their lives to preserve them.
Aiken returns to his seat, and glances at Mary. A small nod
expresses her gratitude. Out of the corner of his eye, Aiken
spots Catherine, who is visibly moved.

HOLT (0.S.)

Gentlemen. One bullet may have killed

our beloved President.
Holt begins his rebuttal.

HOLT
One bullet, but not one man!

We close on a WIDE SHOT of the CROWDED courtroom. .
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

The same WIDE SHOT of the courtroom, only now it's EMPTY --
indicating the TRIAL is OVER.

EXT./INT. FOREST -- LOG CABIN - NEXT DAY
The sound of nature fills the secluded log cabin.

John Surratt leans over a DESK with a bottle of BOURBON beside
as he agonizes over what to do.

INT. MARY'S CELL -- SAME
Aiken enters.

AIKEN
They're still deliberating. It's a
good sign.

Mary says nothing.
AIKEN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry I went after your son like
that. I felt I had no choice.
After several moments.
MARY

How 'bout we forget about the trial
for a while?

Aiken nods, pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket.
MARY (CONT'D)

Surely, there must be others you'd
prefer to play with.
93.

AIKEN
I'm afraid I've lost my seat at the
card table.

MARY

I reckon' that's true.
She takes the cards from Aiken's hands.

MARY fen >)
Both my father and husband went to
their eternal rest without a dime
cause of these fifty-two.

AIKEN
Perhaps, you'd fancy this instead?

He withdraws a flask from his undercoat, which he smuggled
inside. She takes the flask.

MARY ;
I fancy both -- straight up and seven
card stud.

And she starts shuffling -- like a pro.

MARY (CONT'D)
Hopefully, my luck's about to change.
What are we wagering?

AIKEN
Always the clothes on our backs.

A beat. Then Mary smiles. Aiken finds a spot across from
her, on the floor. As she starts to deal, we hear --

MILITARY COMMISSION (0.S.)
(shouting, in unison)
Aye!

. NINE HANDS raised high in the air
PULL BACK: INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM -- NOON

As the NINE MEMBERS of the Military Commission are seated
around a long dinner table with General Hunter at the head.

GENERAL HUNTER
Well then, we're all agreed on the
penalty of death for the prisoners --
Herold, Atzerodt and Payne.
a beat)
What about the woman?

Several Generals are barely payin eattention as they feast
on prime rib. GENERAL WALLACE, Â© perpetually sketching
judge, draws a CHARIOT RACE on his place setting.

GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
Regarding Mary Surratt. How many in
favor, Gentleman?
94.

STANTON (0.S.)
Damn it, Joseph! I told you she
must be punished to the full extent.

PULL BACK: INT. WAR DEPARTMENT - STANTON'S OFFICE -- LATER
SECRETARY STANTON is irate. HOLT attempts to appease him.

HOLT
Only four of the nine agreed with
our recommendation. The majority
avored a more merciful sentence -
life in prison - on account of her
age and sex.

STANTON
How else will her son surrender if
he's not forced to offer his life
for hers?

HOLT
I understand, sir. Unfortunately,
the Generals' minds are already made.

STANTON
Perhaps, not.

A long beat. Stanton's EYES remain hard and cold.

MARY (0.S.)
This Yank' up North comes home after
chopping some wood...

PULL BACK: INT. MARY'S CELL -- SHORT WHILE LATER
Aiken and Mary have now shared a few -- jokes and drinks.

MARY,
..Says to his wife, "Honey, my hands
are freezing."
(Aiken takes a drink)
"Put 'em between my thighs, " she
replies, "That'll warm â€˜em up."

Aiken freezes mid-gulp.

MARY (CONT'D)
After lunch, he goes out and chops
some more wood. Says, "Sweetheart,
my hands are really freezing!"
"Well, put 'em between mk) thighs,"

(Mary downs her drin

Before bed, the Yank' aed out one
more time to get 'em through the
night. "Dear, my hands are frozen,
he says as he walks back inside.
For goodness sake," his wife replies,
"don't your ears ever get cold?"

Aiken spits his drink. Both he and Mary enjoy the moment.

Mary's smile slowly disappears.
95.

MARY (CONT'D)
He hates me.

AIKEN
Pardon?

MARY
My son. It wasn't Lincoln he
despised. It was me.

AIKEN
I don't follow.

MARY
I refused to have him turn out like
his father. I wouldn't let him out
of my sight. Kept him so close I
made him sit out the entire War.
Finally, he got the courage to break
free, and become what he always wanted -
what you are, Frederick.

AIKEN
What's that?

MARY
Your own man.

A long beat.

MARY (CONT'D)
Go to her.

Off Aiken's confusion, Mary says solemnly --
MARY (CONT'D)
I'm not looking forward to it. But
I'm ready for what they have in store
for me. Anna is not.

AIKEN
I'm not leaving you.

MARY
Please, Frederick. She's not as
strong as she thinks.
Off Aiken taking this in --
INTERCUT: Shiny DRESS SHOES with worn RIDING BOOTS.

Crossing cobblestone. Traversing prison grounds.
Ascending wooden steps. Climbing a steel staircase.

A painted FRONT DOOR swings open...
PULL BACK: EXT. /INT. SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE -- DUSK

Revealing Aiken, in dress shoes, standing in the doorway.
Anna, her eyes swollen red with tears, averts Aiken's eyes.

And then an IRON GATE pivots on its hinges...
96.

PULL BACK: INT. MARY'S CELL -- SAME

Revealing a SOLDIER, barely 19, in riding boots. Mary looks
him in the eye, as he begins reading aloud from a document.

YOUNG SOLDIER
After mature consideration of the
evidence...

As_we INTERCUT from dmage- to- image, accompanied by the Young
Soldier reading the verdict --

INT. CAPITOL, REVERDY JOHNSON'S OFFICE
Senator Johnson pulls a well-worn PAMPHLET off his shelf.
YOUNG SOLDIER (V.O.)

Aiken follows Anna in as she attempts to conceal her distress.
YOUNG SOLDIER (V.O.)

of the United States...
As we CUT TO --
EXT. CENTURY CLUB

Baker, Hamilton and pals exit the Club joking and laughing.
They are met by Catherine and several girlfriends.

YOUNG SOLDIER (V.O.)
...GUILTY of conspiring to kill and

of State of the United States...
As we CUT BACK TO --
INT. CELL

Mary's stoic expression remains unchanged.
97.

YOUNG SOLDIER (V.O.)
...The Commission does, therefore,
sentence you, Mary Surratt...

The Soldier stops, looks up at Mary before continuing, as we
quickly CUT from one image to another --

-- Reverdy reading from the Constitution...
-- John Surratt downing his drink... |
-- Aiken and Anna remain in silence, her back to him...
And then we CUT BACK TO --
INT. CELL
Mary calmly nods for the Soldier to continue reading.
YOUNG SOLDIER (V.O.
...TO be hanged by the neck unti
she be dead.

Mary maintains her "face" until the Young Soldier exits...
then buckles, just a bit, from what she's just been told.

As we CUT BACK TO --
INT. _BOARDINGHOUSE

Anna and Aiken remain in silence for several beats. Finally,
Aiken says softly...

AIKEN
You were in love with Booth. That's
why you didn't burn his photo.
After a moment...
ANNA
I swear I had no idea what he was
capable of.
We HOLD ON Anna, as we CUT TO --
INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

John Surratt storms inside as Anna, in an apron with her
hair up, is preparing supper.

JOHN SURRATT
Booth is crazy. He's gonna get us

into trouble -- or worse.

ANNA
Calm down, John. Just tell me what
happened.

JOHN SURRATT
He told me to pack a bag. He didn't
say where I'm going. He just insists
I leave town tonight.
98.

ANNA
Ok. Then go pack your bag.

JOHN SURRATT
Ma won't let me go -- even if I
wanted.

ANNA
What he's fighting for... what we're
fighting for is more important than
any of us.

JOHN SURRATT
Richmond's fallen. The War is over

ANNA
The War is far from over, John.
There's still much we can do!
(John doesn't budge)
Don't be like Pa. Have the courage
to see something through.

John angrily turns away, and storms up the stairs.

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
Impressive.

Anna is startled. Booth is standing in the kitchen doorway.

ANNA
Mr. Booth.

_ BOOTH
Anna. Looking as lovely as ever.

ANNA
"Lovely". Indeed, you are a fine
actor.

Anna removes her apron in an attempt to make herself
presentable.

ANNA (CONT'D)
How long have you been there?

BOOTH
Long enough to know the Cause would
be better off with more like you.

ANNA
Thank you, Mr. Booth. That's a
compliment I will accept.

There is an undeniable chemistry here.

Off-screen, Mary and her son are in a heated conversation.
(NOTE: The rest of this scene is familiar from earlier in
the script -- only we saw it from Mary's POV, not Anna's.)

MARY (0.S.)
There's nothing more you can do.
99.

JOHN SURRATT (0.S.)
The war is far from over, Mother
And there's still much I can do!

BOOTH
Does he not have an original thought?

ANNA
Think what you will, Mr. Booth, but
he's still my brother.

BOOTH
My apologies, Miss Surratt. I'll
see to it he makes you proud.

MARY (0.S.)
John, please.

JOHN SURRATT (0.S.)
Unhand me, Mother.

Suddenly, there is a CRASH upstairs. Silence follows. Anna
moves towards the stairs, but Booth grabs her arm.

BOOTH.
(shouts upstairs)
John, are you coming or not?

Moments later, John Surratt comes down the stairs, a packed
bag in hand. He blows past Anna, and says to Booth.

JOHN SURRATT
Let's go.

Booth and Anna exchange a look. Booth follows John Surratt
out the front door.

Several moments later Mary comes down the stairs. She is
bleeding from a cut above her eye.

Off Mary exchanging a long look with Anna, we CUT BACK TO --
PRESENT TIME: INT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Anna, tears now streaking her face, is holding a WANTED POSTER
featuring John Surratt.

ANNA
it should be my face on this -- not
is.

Aiken remains silent.

ANNA (CONT'D)
I am such a coward. He's my younger
brother. I should've protected him.
But instead, I pushed him into it.

AIKEN
You didn't know exactly what you
were pushing him into.
100.

ANNA
I know now. And yet I still told
you where to find him, and damned
im on the stand.

AIKEN
You did so to save your mother.
ANNA ;
They need to know what I did.
AIKEN

To what end? Because it will help
your mother none.

ANNA
But it's the truth.

AIKEN
Does she know?

Anna nods.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Then no one else needs to.

And Aiken turns for the door, and exits, leaving Anna alone.
EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aiken begins to descend the steps. He hesitates a moment
thinks on it, and then continues on his way.

INT. CELL

Mary, at her cell window, soaks in the late afternoon
sunlight, as we hear, off screen --

PAPER BOY (0.S.)
DEATH BY HANGING! DEATH BY HANGING

PULL BACK: EXT. WASHINGTON STREET

As a DOZEN CUSTOMERS surround a PAPER BOY, who is chanting
the headlines aloud, almost gleefully.

PAPER BOY
Mary Surratt To Meet Her Doom..
Four Assassins Die Tomorrow at Noon

Aiken happens upon the excitement, still unaware. As the
crowd slowly parts, the headline is revealed to him:

FOUR CONSPIRATORS TO BE EXECUTED

Herold, Atzerodt, Payne
&
MARY SURRATT

Others Get Prison Terms
101.

Aiken looks up from the paper and spots Catherine -- along
with his mates -- across the street.

Aiken takes off. Only Catherine sees him scurrying away.
While the others chatter about the impending executions,
Catherine remains apart, with a look of dismay, as we cut to --

FULL SCREEN: Of a ROCK, wrapped with the latest newspaper
surrounded by shattered GLASS...

PULL BACK: INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - FOYER

Revealing Anna, slumped, sobbing, with the rock beside her
It's clear she's now heard the news.

INT. U.S. CAPITOL - AIKEN'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Aiken, in disbelief. Reverdy Johnson is behind his desk

AIKEN
Mudd, Arnold and O'Laughlin got life
in prison instead of death. And
Spangler only a half a dozen years.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Stanton doesn't want their sons.
Any word from hers?

Aiken shakes his head.

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
qhen there's nothing more you can
oO.

AIKEN
There has to be something.

REVERDY JOHNSON
Fred, you ve done everything you
ossibly could. Better than I would
ave done. But your only allegiance
now must be to yourself.

AIKEN
There are at least a dozen grounds
on which to appeal this verdict.

REVERDY JOHNSON
And you know there's no appealing
it. That's why Stanton tried her in
a military court.

AIKEN
What about petitioning the President
for a stay?

_. REVERDY JOHNSON ;
The President signed the execution
order. It's over.
102.
AIKEN
Can you get me in to see him? I'll
plead her case directly...
Reverdy cuts him off.
REVERDY JOHNSON
If John Surratt won't sacrifice
himself, son, why should you? She's
not your mother.

AIKEN
And you're not my father.

CHOIR BOY (0.S.)
Colonel Aiken?

A CHOIR BOY, 12, is standing in the doorway. Aiken nods.

CHOIR BOY
This here's for you.

The Boy passes him a NOTE. Aiken quickly reads it, then
grabs his jacket and heads for the door

REVERDY JOHNSON
Stanton will destroy you if you
persist. Freddie, this is not a war
you can win.
But Aiken is gone, as we CUT TO --
...The SOUND of screeching across a stone floor.
PULL BACK: INT. ARSENAL PRISON - SECOND FLOOR -- DUSK

A GUARD pushes a CART down the second-story CATWALK, stopping
in front of DAVID HEROLD's CELL. He passes a TRAY inside.

HEROLD receives the BEER and SANDWICH, his FINAL MEAL.

AIKEN
And some laudanum to calm the nerves.

Aiken hands her a small bottle filled with liquid.
MARY

My goodness, you remembered the
spanish olives.
103.

AIKEN
It wasn't I.

Aiken nods toward the door, as Anna suddenly appears. Anna
freezes in the doorway. Doesn't know what to do.

Mary opens her arms. Anna rushes into them. For the first
time in a long while Anna is allowed to be a young girl again.

Mary cradles Anna in her arms. She takes in every inch.

MARY
I think this is what I'm going to
miss most.

ANNA
Please, Mama. Don't...

Aiken moves toward the door to give them privacy.

MARY ;
You've heard from my son, Frederick
haven't you?

Aiken stops in his tracks.

MARY (CONT'D)
Fred.

AIKEN
I'm sorry.

MARY
Don't be. He's safe this way. These
smell delicious, Anna. Let's just
enjoy your oysters, shall we? Come,
Frederick.

AIKEN
I'm going to appeal to Father Walter
one last time.

MARY
I forbid you.

AIKEN
If I can produce your son, you just
might live.

MARY

If you "produce" my son, they will
hang him alongside of me.

AIKEN
You don't know that. For God's sake,
Mary, make Father Walter tell us
where they're hiding him.

MARY
I'll do no such thing. Some day,
John will be found.

(MORE )
104.

MARY (CONT'D)
Hopefully then, vengeance will no
longer rule the day.

Anna can remain silent no longer.

ANNA
This is my fault.

MARY
Hold your tongue.

She glances at Aiken.

ANNA
He knows, Ma. He knows I pushed
John into this.

MARY
You poor dear. You must put your
mind at ease.

ANNA

I will never forgive myself.
MARY,

You are not to blame, Anna.
AIKEN

Nor you Mary. It is your son who
should be held accountable. Forget
what he did to the country. Look at
what he's done to your family.

MARY
I assure you, Frederick, we will all
be summoned before the judgment bar

of God -- where every knee must bend
and every tongue confess.

ANNA
Please, Ma. Let me tell them.

MARY
Shhh, my sweet. I've lived a blessed
life. 'm at peace with this. One

day, when you have a child, you'll
understand why it must be this way.

(a beat)
All I ask is that you be there for

your brother -- more than you've
ever been.

A long beat.

MARY (CONT'D)
Promise me.

ANNA
I'll try, Mother.
105.

MARY
Good. Now, let's eat.

Aiken turns for the door

MARY (CONT'D)
Frederick. It's over. You must
stop pursuing John. Is that clear?

A beat.

IKEN
I will stop pursuing John. You have
my word.

And Aiken departs.

The sound of HAMMERING fills Mary's cell. As Mary pulls
Anna closer to her, we CUT TO --

The PRISON COURTYARD below, where WORKMEN are beginning to
construct the GALLOWS. The SETTING SUN envelops the PRISON
in a fiery orange.

INT. MANSION - SITTING ROOM -- SAME

Catherine is meeting with several SOCIETY WOMEN. We don't
know exactly what is being said except that she's arguing
with passion -- and seems to be convincing a few.

INT. WAR DEPT. - HOLT'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING
As Aiken pleads with Holt, far less successfully.

HOLT
The death sentence is signed, Colonel.
There's nothing I can do.

AIKEN
I'm not asking to overturn the verdict --
merely for a stay. So, I can petition
for a new trial, in a civil court
before a jury of her peers.

OLT
Then, you â€˜ll Have to speak directly
with the President. He's the only
one who can grant such a delay.

Aiken begins to leave. Holt calls out.

HOLT (CONT'D)
I dare say, you have a better chance
overturning this building than getting
him to save your client. Lest, he
arouse suspicion his own hands have
Lincoln's blood on them.

Aiken seems about to disclose John Surratt's whereabouts.
106.

HOLT (CONT'D
Something you wish to tell me,
Colonel?

Aiken considers, then shakes, No.

HOLT (CONT'D)
In that case, dear boy, there's
nothing more you can do.

EXT. GARDEN -- EARLY EVENING

Catherine is now surrounded by a larger crowd of SOCIETY
WOMEN -- all near her age. Seems she's won more converts to
her side, though her exact cause is not yet clear to us.

EXT./INT. WHITE HOUSE -- SAME

The lights are on UPSTAIRS in the President's private
residence, but he's nowhere to be found DOWNSTAIRS.

Aiken appeals to two graybeards -- CONGRESSMAN KING and
SENATOR LANE -- just inside the front FOYER.

AIKEN
All I require is a few moments of
the President's time.

CONGRESSMAN KING
I've already told you, Colonel, the
President won't interfere with the
Court's ruling. This is a military
matter, and must be taken up with
the War Department

AIKEN
And I just told you, they're insisting
the decision is up to the President.

SENATOR LANE
We're sorry.

AIKEN
Congressman King. Senator Lane. At
least, permit me to ask President
Johnson for a week's delay.

SENATOR LANE

The judges have ruled, and there's

nothing the President can do.
Off Aiken appearing to have run out of options, we CUT TO --
...The SOUND of shattered GLASS.
PULL BACK: INT. MARY SURRATT'S CELL - SAME
As Mary smashes the empty laudanum bottle into pieces. She
checks Anna, who is in a laudanum-induced deep sleep, before

selecting the largest SLIVER. Mary begins to raise the knife-
like shard up towards her THROAT...
107.

Slice...Slice...SLICE... STRANDS of HAIR falling gently into
her lap. Mary starts WEAVING the LOCKS together as the sound
of HAMMERING fills the room like a rhythmic DIRGE...
EXT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING -- EVENING
As the MOON rises high in the sky.
INT. AIKEN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
Aiken enters, crestfallen, seemingly nothing more he can do.
To his surprise, Reverdy Johnson q5 seated behind his desk --
surrounded by LEGAL TOMES.
REVERDY JOHNSON
Pull up a chair, Freddie. We've got
a long night ahead.

Aiken does as told. The men start working away, their heads
buried in case law. After several beats --

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Know any jokes?

AIKEN
Matter of fact I do.

INT. U.S. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTYARD -- MIDNIGHT

HAMMERING continues into the night. The SCAFFOLD is now
HALF-COMPLETE.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. U.S. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTYARD -- DAWN

As FIRST LIGHT appears revealing the hammering has CEASED --
the SCAFFOLD is now COMPLETE.

JULY 7, 1865
INT. U.S. CAPITOL - REVERDY JOHNSON'S OFFICE -- SAME

SUNLIGHT catches Aiken in the EYE. He looks at Reverdy, who
is writing away, then glances at the WALL CLOCK, which reads:

6:05 A.M.

Suddenly, CATHERINE appears in the doorway accompanied by a
DOZEN WOMEN in their Sunday best.

AIKEN
Catherine? What are you doing here?

CATHERINE
We wish to help your client.

AIKEN
How?
108.

CATHERINE
By petitioning the President on her
behalf.

AIKEN

You're serious.
Catherine nods. So do the other women.

AIKEN (CONT'D)

It's a_very kind gesture. Thank

you. But I've tried. It's impossible

to even get through the door.
CATHERINE

Perhaps, the daughters of a senator,

congressman, two ambassadors and a

cabinet member may persuade him to
let us in.

Aiken looks at Reverdy for his response.
REVERDY JOHNSON
"Impossible" may have been a bit
strong, Fred. Ladies, good luck

Reverdy, Catherine exchange smiles. Aiken is clearly touched.
Reverdy hands Aiken a DOCUMENT he's been working on.

REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Frederick. Run.

Catherine gives Aiken a kiss, as he rushes out the door
INT. U.S. CAPITOL - MOMENTS LATER

Aiken sprints across STATUARY HALL past the BUSTS of our
Founding Fathers, then out the Capitol doors.

...Pounding and POUNDING.
PULL BACK: EXT. TOWNHOUSE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

Aiken beats on the FRONT DOOR of a three-story BROWNSTONE,
along a quiet, residential street.

No street TRAFFIC outside. No LIGHTS on inside. No ANSWER.

Aiken pounds again and again. Moments later, a fragile, OLD
MAN opens the door, still tying on his robe.

OLD MAN
What in God's name?

AIKEN
Justice Wylie

OLD MAN/JUSTICE WYLIE
Who are you?
109.

AIKEN
Frederick Aiken, your honor. TI have
an application here for a writ of
habeas corpus.

JUSTICE WYLIE
Are you daft, young man? It's barely
light.

AIKEN
It can't wait, sir. The Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia is
out last hope.

JUSTICE WYLIE
What's this about?

AIKEN
Mary Surratt.

Wylie becomes agitated.

JUSTICE WYLIE
I can't help you, son. I'm sorry.
Now, please go.

Aiken holds up the WRIT APPLICATION.

_ AIKEN
Please, sir. Either you act_now -
or else an innocent woman will die.

Wylie begins to close his door... then pauses to reconsider
He checks the street both ways before waving Aiken inside.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE -- SAME

Catherine leads her small army inside the White House, past
the gatekeepers -- SENATOR LANE and CONGRESSMAN KING.

INT. JUDGE'S STUDY -- SHORT WHILE LATER

MRS. WYLIE enters with tea and biscuits. Aiken anxiously
waits as Justice Wylie reviews his WRIT.

JUSTICE WYLIE
During the War, Lincoln suspended a
number of our rights -- including
the writ of habeas corpus, which you
seek here today. If he hadn't, we
might've lost the Union. So, how
can you argue with his decision?
What good is our Constitution if
our nation is destroyed?

Aiken looks distraught.
JUSTICE WYLIE (CONT'D)
But then again, what good is our
nation without our Constitution...

Off Aiken's expression changing to relief --
110.

INT. WAR DEPARTMENT - HOLT'S OFFICE -- SHORT WHILE LATER

As Aiken slams the WRIT down on Holt's desk. Holt, caught
off-guard, shaving foam still on his face, examines the WRIT.

HOLT

You had no right, Colonel.
AIKEN

Wrong, "dear boy". It's our

Constitutional right. She should be
released no later than noon.

Aiken exits. Holt turns to an aide.
HOLT
Sergeant. Find Secretary Stanton --
immediately!
EXT. WHITE HOUSE -- SHORT TIME LATER

As Catherine and her group emerge from the White House,
Stanton rushes inside. Catherine looks on with concern.

INT. ARSENAL PRISON - MARY'S CELL -- SHORT WHILE LATER
Anna has a look of shock
ANNA
So there'll be a civil trial next
time? No generals?

AIKEN
No generals.

Anna can barely believe Aiken's news. Mary too.

MARY
Bless you, son.

Mary regards Aiken as if he were her own. He's clearly moved.
Anna and Mary embrace. Aiken glances out the window.

AIKEN'S POV: From the window down into the COURTYARD below --
FOUR CHAIRS are being set up atop the HANGING PLATFORM.

Aiken's face fills with panic.

As he turns back from the window, SOLDIERS suddenly appear
at Mary's door. Leading the way is the prison's COMMANDANT.

COMMANDANT
Ma'am, it's time.
AIKEN
What are you doing?
COMMANDANT

We need to prepare her with the
others.
141.

AIKEN
The only preparing should be for her
release.

The Commandant glances toward Anna.

COMMANDANT
I advise sedating the young lady.

ANNA
You'll do no such thing.

Aiken presents the Judicial Order.

AIKEN
I've got a writ that says Mary Surratt
is to be released into my custody.

COMMANDANT
Colonel. The President just suspended
your writ.

He hands Aiken the Executive Order from the War Department.

COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. She's to hang alongside
the others no later than noon. Now,
step aside. We've got less than an
our.

On the Commandant's signal, the Soldiers move Aiken aside.

ANNA
Frederick. Do something.

Anna clutches her mother. Mary slips a HAIR BRACELET she's
woven from her own locks onto her daughter's wrist.

MARY,
I'll always be with you.

ANNA
Please. Tell them they can't.

Aiken scans the Executive Order. His expression indicates
there's nothing he can do. As the Soldiers begin to escort
Mary, she clasps her BIBLE and ROSARY beads.

MARY
No mother was ever more proud, Anna.
Frederick. Thank you.

Aiken steadies Anna. But it's as if he's steadying himself.
Suddenly, Anna pulls away from Aiken.

ANNA
Let go of her.

And she pounces on the soldiers. They quickly restrain Anna,
as the Prison Doctor injects her with a sedative.
112.

MARY ANNA
Please, God. Don't No. Mama. No....
let them hurt her.

Anna screams as her mother is being led away. Mary, stricken
with concern, calls out.

MARY
I love you, darling.

Anna crumbles as Aiken catches her

AIKEN
I've got her, Mary. It's ok.

Mary, seeing that Aiken has Anna, relaxes slightly, then
calls out to Aiken.

MARY ; /
Proverbs 29:16, Frederick. Promise
you won't forget.

AIKEN
I promise.

And Mary disappears from view. As Anna begins to fade from
exhaustion and the sedative, she mumbles aloud.

ANNA
I'll never forgive myself.

AIKEN
It's ok, Anna. It's ok.

Anna gently lays Anna down. The Commandant retrieves Mary's
white HANDKERCHIEF from the cell floor, and hands it to Aiken.

COMMANDANT
Proverbs 29:16?

Aiken repeats by rote, staring off, in shock

AIKEN
"When the wicked are in authority,
transgressions increase.
(a beat
But the righteous will look upon
their downfall."

INT. WAR DEPARTMENT - STANTON'S OFFICE -- SHORT WHILE LATER
Aiken rushes past Stanton's AIDE.
STANTON'S AIDE
Sir, you can't enter without an
appointment...
Aiken ignores the Aide, and bursts inside STANTON'S OFFICE.

He finds the War Secretary seemingly OBLIVIOUS to events
beyond -- reading a paper, while devouring a hearty breakfast.
113.

STANTON
You're too late, counselor. You had
your chance.
Stanton's Aide rushes inside.

AIDE
I'm so sorry, Mr. Secretary.

Stanton waves the Aide off.

AIKEN
For God's sake, she's innocent.
STANTON
I didn't sentence her, the Court
did.
AIKEN
At your request, no doubt.
STANTON

Assuming I could, why would I ever
choose to do such a thing?

AIKEN
Revenge.

STANTON
Goodness, no. I'd never go to such
lengths out of vengeance.
(a beat)
But to assure the safety and security
of this nation, indeed, I'd do
anything.

AIKEN
But you want her son.

STANTON
At this point, I'll settle for either
one.

AIKEN
Like a human sacrifice?

STANTON
Just think of her as another casualty
of war.

He points to a stack of CASUALTY PHOTOS from the war.

AIKEN
On which side?

; STANTON
Union over Disunion.

AIKEN
Not the Union I fought for. Nor the
one Lincoln gave his life to save.
(MORE )
114.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
No Union is worth preserving unless
it guarantees justice for all.

STANTON
Words for rallying the troops, Colonel --
Not for running a nation.
AIKEN
If you permit this injustice, I
promise you'll regret the day.

STANTON
Is that a threat, young man?

AIKEN
It's a prediction.

...A Slip of PAPER with "MARY SURRATT" written across it.
PULL BACK: INT. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTYARD -- NEAR NOON

Mary's NAME is put inside a BOTTLE. The bottle is then placed
inside a GUN CRATE baring a "WINCHESTER" label.

The CRATE is set next to THREE identical BOXES -- each with
a bottled name inside -- "ATZERODT," "HEROLD" and "PAYNE".

The FOUR COFFINS now wait to be filled alongside the GALLOWS.
Nearby, a SOLDIER passes the PRISON COMMANDANT a NOTE.

; SOLDIER ;
Captain, the prisoner, Lewis Payne,
just made this confession.

COMMANDANT
What's it about?

SOLDIER
The woman, sir. He swears she's
innocent!
(a_beat)

What if it's the truth?

Both remain in SILENCE as the HANGMAN tests the ROPE.
MATCH CUT TO:

Aiken tugging on a HORSE'S REINS.

BEGIN MONTAGE:
(No dialogue, just music)

Aiken races across town in a horse-drawn BUGGY, desperate to
reach Mary before it's too late.

A GUARD unlocks a METAL DOOR as the PRISONERS -- Atzerodt
Herold, Payne and Mary Surratt -- are led from their CELLS.
Mary clenches ROSARY BEADS firmly in her RIGHT HAND.
115.

The Prison Doctor tends to Anna inside Mary's cell. He places
her hand across her chest -- Mary's HAIR BRACELET now rests
on Anna's heart.

Aiken abandons his buggy in TRAFFIC, and begins weaving his
way through the crowd. He throws off his UNION JACKET as a
passing carriage rides over it, grinding it into the ground.

Inside the PRISON COURTYARD, HUNDREDS of SPECTATORS and PRESS
excitedly await the spectacle about to happen.

A Soldier opens a BLACK PARASOL over Mary's head to
chivalrously shield her from the broiling midday SUN. The
FOUR PRISONERS are now led across the COURTYARD, forced to
pass a GAUNTLET of onlookers on their way to the GALLOWS.

Aiken navigates a gauntlet of his own OUTSIDE the PRISON
WALLS as VENDORS gleefully hawk LEMONADE and CAKES.

Mary ascends the GALLOWS where the HANGMAN now awaits. Aiken
ushes past the MOBS, racing inside the PRISON WALLS. Father
alter, now by Mary's side, administers FINAL RITES.

The other THREE PRISONERS are readied, with WHITE HOODS
covering their heads to conceal their panicked faces. The
HANGMAN removes Mary's BONNET and VEIL, fastening her hands
behind her back, and her skirt about her knees.

Aiken rushes inside the COURTYARD, past BAKER and CATHERINE
desperate to see Mary before it's too late.

He spots Mary. She sees him too. A SMALL SMILE springs to
her lips. Aiken SMILES BACK, wiping tears from his eyes.

He nods one LAST TIME to her. And she to him.

The HANGMAN places the HOOD and NOOSE over Mary's head, as
Aiken looks away -- unable to watch any more.

Aiken feels a HAND on his shoulder. It belongs to REVERDY
JOHNSON, who buttresses Aiken for what's about to happen.

The PRISON COMMANDANT claps THREE TIMES --

Followed by FOUR SOLDIERS, who knock away the support beams
beneath the platform holding up the PRISONERS --

The HANGING PLATFORM swings down on its hinges as Mary and
the others jerk downward with a terrifying...

 

THUMP !

Then, silence -- a long deafening SILENCE -- broken, finally,
by the sound of a FLASH BULB.

We HOLD ON an image of the scaffold, as Mary Surratt becomes
yet another CASUALTY PHOTO of the war

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

...A GAVEL being struck repeatedly with a thump.
116.

JUDGE FISHER (0.S.)
...On the charge of conspiring to
assassinate President Abraham Lincoln.

PULL BACK: INT. CRIMINAL COURT -- DAY

As JUDGE GEORGE FISHER, 54, attempts to quiet the PACKED
COURTROOM with his gavel.

JUDGE FISHER
Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed
upon a verdict?

WASHINGTON, D.C. CRIMINAL COURT

AUGUST 10, 1867 - TWO YEARS LATER
The FOREMAN, 43, rises.

FOREMAN (0.S.)
No, your honor. We have not.

The FOREMAN & JURY are distinct for being indistinct -- 12
CIVILIANS mixed equally of Northerners and Southerners.

FOREMAN
We are deadlocked on the eighth ballot
as we were on the first.

JUDGE FISHER
Do you think you'll ever reach a
unanimous verdict in this matter?
The Foreman looks troubled and weary.

FOREMAN
No, your honor. I'm afraid not.

JUDGE FISHER
In that case, I declare a mistrial.
The defendant is hereby free to leave.

But the DEFENDANT, now revealed, hardly looks free -- JOHN
SURRATT looks more like a prisoner of guilt.

His sister, ANNA, is beside him. She shows no sign of joy,
or even relief. Instead, she glances to the back of the
courtroom to FREDERICK AIKEN, just a bystander now.

Aiken nods to Anna. John Surratt attempts to see where Anna
is looking. But when he does, Aiken is long gone.

...The sound of WEEPING
PULL BACK: INT. COURTHOUSE -- BATHROOM - SHORT WHILE LATER

As we reveal John Surratt is sobbing inconsolably, his face
buried into the wall. He senses someone watching, and turns.

The POV on John Surratt belongs to Aiken, who just stares at
him without a word. John Surratt gathers his emotions.
117.

JOHN SURRATT
You're Frederick Aiken, aren't you?

Aiken nods.

JOHN SURRATT (CONT'D)
I...I never...I wish to thank you
for the kindness you showed my mother

Aiken says nothing.

JOHN SURRATT (CONT'D)
Believe me, Mr. Aiken, I never thought
they'd kill her. Sheâ€™ committed no
crime.

AIKEN
Well, now you have your freedom.

JOHN SURRATT
i killed my mother. I will never be
ree.

Neither says a word. Tears streak Surratt's face. Aiken
removes a white HANDKERCHIEF from his pocket.

AIKEN
It belonged to her. I hope it
comforts you in your grief.

Aiken begins to leave.

JOHN SURRATT
Keep it, Colonel. She now belongs
to you.

Aiken pauses a moment and decides to keep the handkerchief.
He exits without a word as we HOLD ON John Surratt's grief.

EXT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- HALLWAY - DAY
Aiken exits the majestic building. He is met by Catherine
and Baker. He spots Anna across the way, in conversation.
Aiken excuses himself, and walks over to Anna.
Anna greets him with a warm smile.
ANNA

It's good of you to come, Frederick.

I'd like you to meet my husband.

William Tonry, this is...

WILLIAM TONRY
It's an honor, Mr. Aiken.

WILLIAM TONRY, mid-20s, shakes Aiken's hand.

Anna lovingly grabs her belly, which we now realize is
pregnant. Her mother's hair bracelet is apparent.
118.

ANNA
If she's a girl, we're naming her
Mary.

AIKEN
Your mother would like that.
An awkward beat.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
I should be getting back.

Anna nods sweetly.

AIKEN (CONT'D)
Congratulations to you both.

WILLIAM TONRY
It was nice meeting you.

Aiken smiles, and rejoins Catherine and Baker.

As they descend the Courthouse steps, several YOUNG TURKS
watch Aiken with a look of awe -- reminiscent of Aiken with
his buddies spotting luminaries at the start of the story.

One of the young turks begins to approach Aiken, but his
buddy grabs him.

YOUNG TURK #1
You can't just go up to him without
an introduction.

We pull back as Aiken crosses beneath a grand STATUE of LADY
JUSTICE -- a SCALE, in one hand, and SWORD, in the other

We continue pulling back until Aiken and the others are
SWALLOWED by the People below ...

BEGIN END CREDITS:
(titlecards accompanied by relevant images)

The year after the Conspirators' trial the SUPREME COURT
ruled military trials of U.S citizens were unconstitutional.

Few were surprised a jury -- half from the North and half
from the South -- could not agree on a verdict in the matter
of JOHN SURRATT. He was never tried again.

EDWIN STANTON was fired by President Johnson after discovering
he had forced the Commission to change Mary Surratt's sentence
from life to death. Stanton never held office again.

(IMAGE: Stanton barricading himself inside his office.)

JOSEPH HOLT denied his role in the plot with Stanton, and

spent the rest of his life trying to clear his own name.
(IMAGE: Holt being hounded by the press.)
119.

None of the GENERALS ever served on another Military
Commission. But GENERAL LEWIS WALLACE did achieve renown of
a_different sort, as the author of BEN HUR.

(IMAGE: Wallace Sketching chariot races at the deliberations. )

CONGRESSMAN PRESTON KING and SENATOR JAMES LANE, both
reportedly guilt-ridden at having helped prevent a stay of
execution, committed suicide soon after Mary Surratt's death.
(IMAGE: The pair blocking Aiken from seeing the President. )

JOHN SURRATT married a relative of Francis Scott Key, the
author of "The Star Spangled Banner." He was the father of
seven and worked as an auditor until his death in 1916.
(IMAGE: John still weighted with guilt.)

ANNA SURRATT and her husband had four children. Fired by

the War Department for marrying Anna, WILLIAM TONRY went on

to earn the first honorary degree in chemistry from Georgetown
University. The couple named their eldest, Mary.

(IMAGE: Anna showing her hair bracelet to her daughter, Mary.)

SENATOR REVERDY JOHNSON continued battling to safeguard the
Constitution. He was instrumental in saving President Johnson
from impeachment by a partisan group led by Edwin Stanton.
(IMAGE: Johnson happily eating his dinner alone. )

FREDERICK AIKEN left the law and became a journalist. But
kept his promise to Mary Surratt, continuing to fight
injustice as the first city editor of THE WASHINGTON POST.
(IMAGE: Aiken, Catherine by his side, putting out the paper.)

In 1869, PRESIDENT JOHNSON granted full unconditional pardons
to the only conspirators still living -- SAMUEL MUDD, EDWARD
SPANGLER and SAMUEL ARNOLD. He ordered the bodies of the
others be exhumed and returned to their families.

MARY SURRATT was given a proper burial by her daughter, ANNA,
outside of Washington, D.C. FREDERICK AIKEN was by her side.
