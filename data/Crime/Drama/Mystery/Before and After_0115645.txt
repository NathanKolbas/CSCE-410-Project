BEFORE AND AFTER

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
INT. PATTY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 1

A small, mod apartment (high-rise, city lights, etc.).
We're at a party: with-it people in cocktail clothes,
most of them slender, the women playing up bodies.
Liquor, dishes of nuts, pretzels, candy on every
table. UNDER THE TITLES and STAR CAST CREDITS: The
hostess, PATTY, very thin and sexy, refills drinks,
serves rich hors d'oeuvres to the guests who are in-
volved in a game of charades. Most guests take some-
thing, a few refuse. PHIL, very macho, acts out the
book title: "LOOKING OUT FOR #1." AD LIBS of...
"seeking," "searching," "looking"... "Looking, looking"
... etc, During that we BECOME AWARE of certain of
the guests: MARGE, rather rolly-polly, tires of the
game, takes hors d'oeuvres tray to help Patty.

MARGE
Let me help, Patty.

PATTY
Oh, thanks, Marge.

Marge eats a few as she passes them around. JACK,
mid-thirties, slim, nice-looking, just beginning to
bald, is more interested in the very young redhead
beside him than in the game -- and she in him. On
Jack's other side, VICKY, Jack's wife, quite overweight,
wearing a too-tight pantsuit, but very atractive and
vivacious, steals a disapproving look at Jack, and then
turns back to the game. Phil is now pointing to him-
self and gesturing "1." TITLES END.

VICKY
"Looking Out For Number 1!’

AD LIB applause and agreement. Patty hands an hors
d'oeuvre tray to Phil, as she kisses him.

PATTY
Brilliant, Phil, darling. Now
you can be host again.

During that, Vicky polishes off a handful of nuts, and
gets up to be next. She takes the folded paper that's
handed to her, reads it.

VICKY
Oh, no! Oh, come on! This
sounds like something my husband
would dream up.
(to Jack)
Jack, did you?

Jack glances at her, shakes his head, no, and goes
back to the redhead. Vicky watches until:

MARGE
Come on, Vicky, start.

AD LIB urging, and Vicky gestures that she's starting.
She makes the proper gestures for AD LIBBED reactions:

"Book title’... "Five words"... "Non-fiction"... "com-
plete title"... Vicky begins to run in place. AD LIBS:
"Hurry"... "Chase"... "race"... Vicky gestures "keep
trying"... as she runs toward Jack, runs in place in

front of him, until --

JACK
(turning toward her)
Run?

She gestures "yes," and to keep trying... and runs
harder -- as Jack turns back to the redhead. Vicky
notes that, disapproving, and then is drawn back to
the game. AD LIBS: “Run, Spot, Run?"... "Maybe it's
not run," etc., as Patty and Marge pass food trays and
Phil refills wine glasses. He pours for a PAUNCHY MAN.

PAUNCHY MAN
I hope it's dry wine. Dry has
less calories.

PHIL
Drink up. You can fast tomorrow.

Patty, turning to the game:

PATTY
"Run For Your Life’?

Vicky gestures no, try again... and runs harder, really
lifting her legs, and racing hard in place. She ges-
tures a full circle with her arms.

We're BEHIND her as:

MARGE
I've got it, I've got it! ‘The
Complete Book of Running'!

Applause. Vicky takes a deep, thankful bow and -- her
pants split -- in full view of those behind her.
There's an awkward silence as those who don't see it
react to those who do. Vicky stands, frozen for a
moment. Jack is embarrassed, turns away from the red-~
head. And then. Vicky grins widely (a facade), turns so
everyone can see the ripped pants, and throws her hands
up in a champion's gesture.

VICKY
The winner and new champion,
Vicky Matthews!

The room erupts into applause and laughter. Jack re-
laxes, and turns his attention back to the redhead.

INT. PATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A glamorous bedroom, with one corner used as a sewing
room -- materials and supplies neatly stashed in
cubbyholes over a sewing machine, with a slender form
wearing a half-finished disco dress standing next to
it. Vicky is easing out of the torn pants, as Patty
goes through her clothes in the closet. She takes out
various items, a dress, a pair of pants, a robe, all
sexy, all too small for Vicky, as --

VICKY

Why did you invite the redhead?
PATTY

I didn't. Phil did.
VICKY

So why doesn't she hit on Phil?

PATTY
She likes husbands better. than
boyfriends. How about this?

Showing Vicky a filmy robe.
VICKY
Oh, sure! Patty, none of that
is going to fit me.

Vicky wraps the torn pants around herself, and goes
to the sewing machine.
VICKY
(continuing)
Why don't you make yourself a
caftan?
PATTY
I don't like them. They camouflage
everything.
VICKY

(patting her hip)
Yeah... everything.

She goes through the pile of neatly folded materials.

PATTY
Phil likes me in tight, revealing
clothes.

VICKY
Everything I have is tight, and

revealing. Of course, none of
it started out that way.

{picks up a piece

of material with a

loud, splashy print)
Hey, how about.

PATTY
Vicky! That's for my new couch
cover.

VICKY

Perfect for me.

THE LIVING ROOM

MUSIC is PLAYING now, and people standing around talk-
ing, eating, as Vicky appears in a "sari" made of the
bright, splashy print.

VICKY
Ta-da!

Vicky holds a model's pose -- gets applause and laugh-
ter from those around her... and a glare from Jack.
Then he turns back to the redhead.

(CONTINUED)
¢

CONTINUED:

Vicky sees that, the smile drops and she moves to the
hors d'oeuvres table. Marge is there, relishing the
pastries.

MARGE
The cream puffs are great.
Vicky nods and takes one -- and a drink in her other
hand -- all with an "I'll show you" determination.

INT. JACK'S OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT

Jack drives a large Oldsmobile sedan, and Vicky, still
in the sari, sits beside him. Both are angry. The
car RADIO counterpoints with romantic MUSIC.

VICKY
IL think I look very... exotic.

JACK
You look like you couldn't find
anything big enough in Patty's
closet.

VICKY
(comically)
Poor girl is just skin and bones.

They ride a moment, silently. The MUSIC ENDS, and a
commercial comes on: A.JINGLE advertising a well-
known candy. Vicky flicks OFF the RADIO.

VICKY
(continuing; digging)
And you don't like your women
bony. You like them popping out
of their clothes.

She makes a simpery, sexy gesture.

JACK
All right, Vicky --

VICKY
(imitating him)
All I did was talk to the girl.

JACK
(exactly the same
way)
All I did was talk --

JACK (CONT'D)

She's a nice girl.

VICKY
If you happen to like sexy
looking broads.

JACK
I married a sexy looking broad.

He looks at her accusingly. Vicky flinches under it,
looks for a retort, then --

VICKY
Well... well... I married a guy
with hair on his head.

Jack's hand goes automatically to his head to cover a
thin spot.

EXT. THE MATTHEWS HOUSE - NIGHT

A suburban, upper-middle class house. A vintage Ford
coupe is parked to one side of the driveway, almost
blocking the other side. The Oldsmobile pulls in off
the street, has to angle around the Ford, going onto
the grass, before it can get to the garage.

JACK (0.S.)
Your mother didn't move her car.
Didn't you tell her?

VICKY (0.S.)
I told her.

The garage door opens automatically, revealing a late
model Chevy wagon, parked behind the Ford. The Olds
pulls into the garage next to it.

INT. THE MATTHEWS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Vicky and Jack have just come in. Vicky is still hold-
ing the ripped pants. HELEN, Vicky's mother, is
maternal and very slender. She reaches for her coat,
purse and knitting and looks Vicky over at the same
time.

HELEN
You didn't go to a costume party.

HELEN (CONT'D)
How come you came home from one?

Vicky holds the pants up for Helen to see. And then
she mouths with Helen --

HELEN
(continuing)
I told you the pants were too
tight.
VICKY
I know you did, Mom. Thanks for
sitting.
(heading for the
bedroom)

Kids give you any trouble?

HELEN
They never give me trouble.

Helen looks at Jack.

HELEN
(continuing;
gesturing a fat
body
Do something with her.

JACK
I'm trying, Helen.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Im addition to the usual bedroom furnishings, an exer-
cycle stands in one corner. Vicky comes into the room,
goes to her dressing table, opens a bottom drawer and
pushes things around until she finds a hidden candy
bar. She starts to unwrap it, but the SOUND of the
DOOR OPENING stops her. She drops the candy bar back
into the drawer, and pushes it closed, as Jack comes
in. He stands just inside the doorway, looking at her,
and Vicky sees his reflection in the mirror. They're
both uncomfortable, turn away. Then --

VICKY
. I'm sorry...

JACK
So am I...

CONTINUED:

She holds up a thumb toward him -- a private symbol
they have. Jack holds his up -- as if to press the
thumbs together -- but they're still across the room
from each other.

VICKY
Friends?
A beat... and they move toward each other... just
close enough to press thumbs together.
JACK
Friends.
But the aura of the quarrel is still there -- they
drop their hands, and don't know what to do next.
Jack looks over the sari... tries for a grin.
JACK
(continuing)

You know... you do look pretty
sexy in that thing.

Vicky grins, then in a comical, but sexy way, she
hands him an end of the sari, and they dance around
each other as he unwraps it, while they hum some
torchy song. Then they go into each other's arms.
They kiss, begin to touch each other, run their hands
over each other. Jack's hand reaches Vicky's buttocks.
He squeezes.

JACK
(continuing;
murmuring)
There's the beautiful bun that
split the pants.

Vicky freezes, and then, furious, she pushes him away.

VICKY
You bought that pantsuit. I
didn't.

JACK
You said you liked it.

VICKY
I would have liked it a size
larger.

JACK

You were going to lose weight
by the party.

VICKY
I never said that. You said
Thac.

JACK

You wanted that electronic calorie
counter, and that exercycle thing.
I got them for you.

VICKY
I didn't want them. You wanted
them.

JACK

What do you want? Ten cream puffs?

VICKY
They're mostly air.

JACK
Vicky, it's not a joke. You're
eating yourself right back to
where you were when Danny was

born. Why?
VICKY
(comical question)
I'm hungry?
JACK
(cynically
paraphrasing)
That's funny, you don't look
hungry.
VICKY

That's not funny!

JACK
No, it's not, Vicky! And it
gets less funny by the pound.

Vicky glares at him, and suddenly grabs a blanket off
the bed. Jack, knowing what's coming, has his hand up
ready -- Vicky throws the blanket, and he catches it.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jack is asleep on the couch, his head completely
covered by the blanket. LISA, 11, and DANNY, 9, in
their pajamas, sneak up to the couch. Danny lifts the
cover carefully, so they can see who it is.

It's Daddy.
LISA

That'll be a nickel.
As they go back to the bedrooms --

DANNY
Bet a dime the fight was about
Mom eating too much.

And they're gone. Jack wakes up, gets his bearings,
realizing where he is and why. He gets up, stretches,
and drops to the floor to do pushups.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 10

Vicky wakes up, realizes she's alone in the bed --
remembers the fight, and pulls the covers up again.
A beat, she throws off the covers, gets up, turns on
the exercycle but doesn't get on it, and marches past
it to the adjoining bathroom. We SEE her through the
open door as she steps on the scale -- and groans.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY 1L

A cake and cookies are in covered containers on the
counters, sugared cereals are SEEN in open cupboards.
The table is set for a fancy breakfast for four. Lisa
puts the flower centerpiece in the middle, where three
containers of syrup already stand along with jam and
powdered sugar. Jack sets down a tray of hot pancakes.
And Danny leads Vicky in. They're all dressed for the
day, but Vicky is half asleep and in her robe.

JACK
(warily)
Good morning.
LISA

We made breakfast.

VICKY
I'm not hungry.

LISA
Aw, Mom... Daddy said we were
all going to eat together.

DANNY

VICKY

She sits down, and Jack pours coffee for her. She
avoids Jack's eager look and sips at the coffee.

ANOTHER ANGLE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 12

Danny and Jack are just finishing their breakfast.
Lisa is poking at hers, half of it is still on the
plate.

Should we go out and let you
talk now, like after all the
fights?

JACK
Yes.

Danny and Lisa get up as ~-
LISA
Are you driving, Daddy, like
after all the --

JACK
Lisa, knock it off.

Lisa shrugs, and starts out after Danny.

VICKY
You didn't finish your breakfast.

LISA
I'm not hungry.

And she goes. Vicky and Jack are alone. She's staring
into her coffee... Jack looking at her... then --

JACK
Friends?

He holds up his thumb... a beat... and Vicky presses
hers against it.

VICKY
Friends.

She pulls her hand away, uses both hands to hold the
coffee cup, and looks away from him again.

JACK
... You want to meet me downtown
and we'll go out to dinner?

VICKY
Why is the peace offering food?
I thought you wanted me to diet.

JACK
Well... you won't let me buy you
clothes... Flowers! I'll buy
you flowers.

VICKY
I've got a garden full of flowers.

JACK
What do you want?

VICKY
To wake up tomorrow a size 9.

JACK
Then go to Dr. Haymer... He did
it for you before.

VICKY
Yeah, when I was a kid, and a
teenager, and after each baby.
He's a lousy doctor. The disease
keeps coming back... worse every
time.

JACK
(takes her hand)
But in between, Vick, when you
get thin... you were gorgeous
when we got married.
. (moves in closer)
You can look like that again.

He leans over to kiss her -- just as Lisa comes in.

LISA
We're ready, Daddy.

JACK
Lisa, you've got lousy timing.

JACK
Go to him, Vicky... You can be
the sexiest, most beautiful woman
in the world. _
He blows her a kiss, and goes. Vicky reaches up and
grabs it, and mutters to herself.

VICKY
Would it be okay if I was only
the second most beautiful?

She sits a moment, thinking. We HEAR the FRONT DOOR
CLOSE. Without thinking, Vicky picks up the remaining
cold pancake from Lisa's plate and begins to eat it.

on that as:

DR. HAYMER (0.S.)
A candy bar is 250 calories, a
piece of pie is 300, a serving
of peanuts, 400.

WIDEN THE SHOT TO INCLUDE Vicky in DR. HAYMER's office,
sitting across the desk from the doctor, an old femily
friend.

DR. HAYMER
(continuing)
Calories are energy. If you
don't use up the energy, it
gtores itself in your body as

VICKY
And 3500 calories of stored fat
is one pound of body weight. I

DR. HAYMER

printed sheet)
Vicky, go on a diet.

VICKY
(looks at the form
and puts it down)
I went on this diet.

DR. HAYMER
Went where? Off of it?
INT, SUPERMARKET - DAY 14
Busy -- women and men of all sizes, filling carts

with food -- junk, health, lots of both. Above their
heads, advertising banners offering a cornucopia of

goodies -- desserts, starches, dietetic products,
ete., etc. OVER all this:
VICKY (V.0.)

Maybe it's my glands.

We PUSH DOWN an aisle, diet foods on one side, gourmet
bakery on the other, and FIND Vicky and Marge shopping.
Vicky looks at the display of diet supplements with a
before and after picture of a woman in profile, then
joins Marge picking out baked goods as:

DR. HAYMER (V.0.)
It's not glands. It's food. Too
much food. The wrong kinds of
food. Vicky, it's poison, it'll

kill you.

VICKY
So I asked him if I should take
some tests or see an
endocrinologist or something.

MARGE
What'd he say?

Marge takes two more samples, gives one to Vicky and
they move on, past a huge man shoving cans of diet
foods into his cart, as:

VICKY
(imitating Haymer)
If you want to spend your money,
spend your money. But go on a

diet.

her hand)
I ean't start a diet in the middle
of a day. :

They round the corner to the candy aisle as:

There ought to be a magic wand.
A touch and the fat just melts

Or a touch and no one cares.

EXT. THE SUPERMARKET - DAY 15

Vicky and Marge roll their overfilled carts out of the
store, past the drugstore where a window display ad-
vertises diet pills, and to Vicky's station wagon as:

capsules of worms that would eat
your fat from inside? Yuch.

board advertising ice cream -- a bikinied girl eating
a cone... and then FOCUS ON Vicky's station wagon,
loaded with groceries, and Marge as passenger.

VICKY (V.0.)
Wouldn't you like to look like
Patty?

MARGE (V.0.)
Did -you ever see how Patty eats?

The station wagon turns a corner and pulls up into the
line of cars double-parked.in front of an elementary
school. Mostly mothers, a few fathers, sit at their
wheels waiting.

VICKY (V.0.)
Yeah, She doesn't.

Vicky and Marge are sharing a bag of doughnuts as:

MARGE
What a lousy way to live.

VICKY
Why? Patty's got it made... A
great job, a macho live-in
boyfriend, the same figure she
had when she was eighteen. You
know what I have? A 24 hour job
-- being a maid to two kids, a
house, and a husband who's
looking for girls with figures

age, Jeff, watching.

DANNY
Let's go.

VICKY
Mind if we wait for Lisa and
Peggy?

Jeff saunters to the car, and Danny cringes away from
him. Jeff grins at Danny, looks at Vicky, then back

at Danny. He puffs his cheeks out, comically grotesque,
and as Danny leans out the window, Jeff waddles away.

DANNY

Creep!

MARGE
What's all that about?

Danny doesn't answer. Lisa and Marge's daughter, Peggy,
appear at the school door, stop to talk to others.
Danny leans over the front seat, and hits the HORN.

INT. DR. ROLLINS' WAITING ROOM - DAY 19

The walls display charts and medical textbook pictures
of weight related subjects: body types, good and bad
foods, slogans, etc. Men, women and children, most of
them overweight, studiously avoid speaking to each
other. Vicky is as quiet as the rest, flipping
through a medical journal, but actually studying those
around her. A NURSE opens the inside door.

DR. ROLLINS
Over half the people in this
country weigh more than they
should. And they spend 10
billion dollars every year on
fad diets, gadgets, pills,
books, clinics. All they
really need is to eat fewer
calories.

VICKY
But, sometimes isn't it
something the body is doing
wrong?

DR. ROLLINS
Very, very few cases are due to
body irregularity.

VICKY
But my tests... didn't they show
anything?

DR. ROLLINS

Your blood pressure is 130 over
95, it could be lower, but it's
normal, Your sugar level is 120.
100 is better, but it's normal.
But if you gain more weight,
those figures could change --
drastically.

VICKY
What about my glands?

DR. ROLLINS
Sorry. The only thing you can
blame is your fatty cells.

VICKY
(a reprieve, she
thinks)
Yeah?

DR. ROLLINS
We're all born with a certain
amount of fatty cells. There
are two times in our lives when
they multiply. If we're fat as
toddlers, or in our late teens.

DR. ROLLINS

Vicky)
You have time to go on a thousand

exercises -- jog, swim, bike,
jump rope. That will change
your metabolism and burn the
calories off faster... But most
important, Vicky. Get at the
source. Why?

DR. ROLLINS
Find out. I'm no psychologist,

for emotional reasons. Because
they're unhappy, or to make up
for something else they're lacking.

VICKY
Or maybe it's just a vice, like
drinking or drugs... only it
shows more.

DR. ROLLINS

Then get rid of it. Try a group

Anonymous or Calorie Counters.

Vicky looks more and more overwhelmed.

INT. THE MATTHEWS DINING ROOM - DAY 21

It's early evening. Jack and Lisa are working on

the dining room table. Lisa, on homework; Jack, pay-

that at some ANGLES we can SEE Vicky in there, making
dinner. The counter is filled with riches for tonight

She throws the apron at him and marches into the din-

JACK ~
What about dinner?

NEW ANGLE 22
as Lisa appears, playing the "sweet child."

LISA
I'll make it, Daddy.

Vicky hears that, grows even more angry, as she
marches into her bedroom and slams the door.

CUT SHARPLY TO:

INT. THE GYM - LATE AFTERNOON 23

The gym is filled with men and women in sweatsuits, a
few with weight belts, some of the really svelte women
are in leotards, and all the heavy people are sweating
profusely. They follow the male instructor through a
rigorous exercise, bouncing in place in a jogging-like
movement, to recorded MUSIC, and keeping up with vary-
ing degrees of success, as we PAN:

VICKY (0.S.)
(imitating Lisa)
I'll make it, Daddy... the fink.

PATTY (0.S.)
Let her. Let them all take turns
cooking, and let Jack do the
chauffeuring, baby sit a couple
of nights so you can get out.

And now we're on Vicky and Patty, next to each other.
Patty is gorgeous in her leotard, and doing her exer-
cise with ease. Vicky, in a sweatsuit, is barely mov-
ing through it, breathing heavily.

You don't have to be the sweet,

minute of the day.
VICKY
Yes, I do... Jack's entitled to
a good housewife or a good-looking .
wife. TI have to be at least one
of then.
She stops for a breath, as the rest of the class keeps
going.
PATTY
What about what you're entitled
to?
VICKY
(trying the
exercise again)
I've got it.
PATTY
What?
VICKY
Kids, husband, home...
‘PATTY
Is it what you want?
New exercise -- harder -- sit-ups -- and Vicky can only

get her head and shoulders off the floor. She hesi-
tates, then nods, yes.

PATTY
(continuing)
Are you ever going back to work?
You were a damned good advertising
artist.

VICKY
That was 12 years ago.

The thought depresses her.

The class

Patty gets into it easily.

Vicky tries it -- once, twice... a third time. She
rolls over, too far, and does a clumsy backward somer-
sault. And then lies there, defeated.

VICKY
Oh, the hell with it.

EXT. THE GYM ~ NIGHT 24

The SOUND of EXERCISE MUSIC is still HEARD, as Vicky,
worn out, almost limps out of the gym. As she turns
toward the parking lot to one side, we WIDEN THE SHOT
TO INCLUDE the store between the gym and the parking
lot -- an ice cream shop. Vicky gets just past it,
hesitates, looks at the store, hungrily.

INT. THE ICE CREAM STORE - NIGHT 25

Pictures of luscious ice cream combinations line the
walls. Vicky, wedged into a half-armed student chair,
about to attack a large sundae complete with trimmings,
scoops up the cherry, and when it's halfway to her
mouth --

ANGLE - INCLUDING JOYCE 26

a jolly, very overweight women in her mid-30's, sits
at right angles to Vicky. Vicky sees her when she
lifts her head to eat the cherry. Vicky hesitates --
it's as if she's seen a mirror image of herself -- and
she doesn't like it. Joyce looks up -- their eyes
catch, and they're embarrassed. They've been caught
in the act. Finally --

JOYCE
Don’t eat the cherry. Red dye
number two, It's bad for you.

A beat -- and they both laugh. Vicky shrugs a "what
the hell" and digs in. They go on eating as:

VICKY
You live around here?

JOYCE
Of course not. I wouldn't eat
ice cream where people know me.
They might think I'm fat.

They go on eating. Joyce finishes, struggles to get
out of the chair, starts to leave, then stops for:
JOYCE
(continuing)

My name is Joyce and I'm a
compulsive overeater. That's
how we say it at 0.A.

VICKY
You belong to Overeaters Anonymous?

JOYCE
Did, Also Weight Watchers,
Calorie Counters and TOPS. And
as you can see, I gained a great
deal from all of them.

Vicky grins, laughs, and in a moment, they're both
giggling uncontrollably.

27 EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE ICE CREAM STORE - NIGHT 27

Vicky and Joyce leave the store together, as if they're
great, old friends, and walk toward the parking lot.

VICKY
Then there were only three left,
and I couldn't serve that to six
women, sO --

JOYCE
You polished them off, and went
to the store for more.

VICKY
Yeah. I was so sick the next
day --
JOYCE
Did it stop you from eating?
Vicky doesn't need to answer... they walk a minute,
then --
VICKY

The doctor said I should figure
out why... and I thought of a
million reasons... all phony.

They've reached Joyce's car.

Well... bon appetit.

She starts getting into the car, and Vicky reaches
out impulsively to stop her.

VICKY
Joyce, can I call you?

JOYCE
For the next ice cream sundae?

VICKY
Or the next confessional,
which ever comes first.

Joyce digs into her purse for pencil or paper, as --

JOYCE
You'll never use this.

VICKY
Probably not.

She takes the slip of paper with Joyce's phone number
on it, and Joyce gets into the car. Vicky watches as
she drives off, then looks at the phone number, puts it
into her purse, and starts toward her own car.

28 INT. MATTHEWS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 28

Lisa sits in front of the TV eating popcorn, and
watching an old "Lucy" or ? rerun -- a funny dinner
scene. But she's turned to what Jack and Vicky are
saying. Vicky has just come in, and Jack is leading
her toward Danny's room, as --

DANNY (0.S.)
Go away!
INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT 29

Danny is in his pajamas, and huddled into the bed,
with his back to Vicky. She picks up his shirt from
the floor, notices the rips, dirt and blood on it,

and goes with it to the bed. She sits down and turns
him toward her. Danny has made a childish, unsuccess~
ful attempt to clean his face, but the dirt, and
remnants of a bloody nose are still SEEN.

VICKY
... How's the other guy?

DANNY
I barely touched him... He's got
the longest arms!

VICKY
Who?

* DANNY
Jeff Hauser!

He didn't mean to tell her. He turns away, and pushes
down into the covers.

DANNY
He said you had to go through
doors sideways... he said... boy

was I lucky, I didn't have a
mother, I had an elephant... he
said...

And he can't talk any more, he's sobbing too hard.
Vicky holds back her own tears... but the pain is
obvious. Vicky holds her arms out to him, and Danny
goes into them. She holds him, rocking him... as he
sobs and she bites at her lips.

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO
FADE IN:
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 30

A busy place; waiters carry trays heaped with rich food,
pastry carts stand waiting, menus are huge. Baskets
piled high with homemade rolls are on every table. A
fashion MODEL in a flowing, long gown poses for the
women at one table, and a slender luncher, watching,
rejects a basket of hot biscuits/rolls offered by a
waiter. We FOLLOW the Model toward another table,
where someone lathers a roll with butter... and then
MOVE PAST that toward another table where Vicky and
Marge are finishing their lunches. Vicky's eating a
tuna salad, and Marge, a club sandwich with French
fries. A WAITRESS refills their coffee cups.

WAITRESS
Oh, didn't you get rolls?

VICKY
Yes, but I didn't want --

But the Waitress is gone. Marge starts to ladle sugar
into her coffee, as Vicky squeezes some lemon onto her
salad and picks up what she's been saying:

VICKY

(continuing)
I didn’t know what to say to
Danny. ‘I'm not fat?' ‘It's
okay that I'm fat?' ‘Jeff's a
stinking brat and you should beat
him up'?... which is what T wanted
to say. Marge, why don't you use
artificial sweetener in your
coffee?

MARGE
That stuff kills rats.

Two men take the table behind Vicky; the one back to

back with her, pushing his chair quite close in order
to sit down. The Waitress appears with two baskets

of rolls, putting one on the men's table, and one on
icky's.

WAITRESS
There you are.

She leaves. Vicky puts the basket on an adjacent, empty
table -- where the first basket of umeaten rolls sits,
as Marge grabs one.

MARGE
What you should have said is,
"Poor Jeff, he tries to cuddle
with his mother and he hits rib
bones. You've got it made, kid.'

The Model approaches their table, opening her gown to
reveal a matching bikini.

MODEL
(reciting)
Going from beach to beach party
and made out of imported silk, the
ensemble comes in blue, gold and
green, sizes six to twelve, and
sells for $57.95.

MARGE
What do you have in a size 20?

MODEL
I'm sorry.

Both shrug. The Model leaves and Marge reaches for
another roll. As she butters it:

VICKY
That's 120 calories each and you're
on your third.

MARGE
Vicky, I didn't go on pills with
you, and I didn't go on shots with
you, and I'm not going on 1000
calories with you either. So, let
me enjoy this.

They eat silently, then:

VICKY
Do you know what I weigh?

MARGE
No, and I don't want to.

VICKY
Don't worry, I wouldn't tell you.

The Waitress returns and picks up their plates.
WAITRESS
There's dessert with the salad.
Peach cobbler.

She'll take it and I'll have one,
too -- with chocolate ice cream.
VICKY
I don't want...
But the Waitress has gone.
MARGE
You can start your diet tomorrow.
The cobbler here is really great.
VICKY
I've already started and I'm not
o~ going to let you ruin it for me.
ww / MARGE
Then I'll eat both cobblers.
They're pretty small anyway.
VICKY
No! No, I'll eat it, I know I will.
Vicky gets up.
VICKY
(continuing)
If I'm here when the cobbler arrives,
I'll eat it.
MARGE
Where are you going?
VICKY
To make a phone call. I'll meet
you up front.
Vicky tries to move from the table but is stuck because
the man behind her is so close. He's involved in con-
oo versation and is oblivious to her struggle until:
VICKY

Could you move... just an inch?

The man shifts his chair closer to his table, while
giving Vicky an amused once-over. Vicky catches it,
is embarrassed, and covers with:

VICKY
(continuing; to
the man)
Better not eat the rolls. You're
getting paunchy.

And she goes, hearing the men LAUGH behind her. We
TRACK Vicky through the restaurant... and the eating,
and the piles of food, and the waiters serving -- and
Vicky trying not to look at passing goodies. She goes
to the coin telephone on the wall near the cashier.
She gets Joyce's number from her purse, dials, and
gets a busy signal.

She hangs up, turns to watch Marge, now eating the
cobbler a la mode, turns away; notices after-dinner
mints on the cashier's counter, takes one, almost
eats it, puts it back, and dials again. Busy. And
she's getting very upset.

INT. JOYCE'S DEN - DAY 31

It's an office, with a large desk, covered with
papers -- notes, invoices, mail, etc. Joyce {wear-
ing a ratty old muu-muu) leans back in the tilting
swivel chair, in a sexy, come-on way, as she talks
into the phone... and nibbles on nuts from a bowl
on the desk.

JOYCE
Well, I'm wearing a sheer black
negligee... Because I knew I was
calling you... Now?... In the
middie of the day?... No, come
on, Max, don't be silly... I
didn't call you for that, I called
you to tell you that we're having
a special on number 20 bonded
paper... Just for you, $3.95 a
ream... Well, why don't you place
your order, and I'll ask my boss
if I can make the delivery in
person.

She begins to write the order.

INT. RESTAURANT - VICKY ON PHONE 32

She dials again, this time the phone is free. A waiter
carries two huge banana splits past her, and she
watches, as:

VICKY
(into the phone)
Hello, is this Joyce?... From
the ice cream store, and no

maraschino cherries?... Yeah,

Vicky... Oh, I'm fine -- no,

INT. JOYCE'S KITCHEN - DAY 33

It's like a page out of House Beautiful. Everything
Joyce can't put on her body, she puts into her home.
She sets out dishes of ice cream for herself and Vicky,
who looks at it, worriedly.

JOYCE
It's dietetic. No sugar, no salt,
and they don't say how many calories.

As they eat:

VICKY
Marge says she's the only one who's
really happy, because she accepts
who she is, and enjoys it, And
she's right. Patty's got it all,
but she isn't enjoying it.. I've
got everything Patty doesn't have
. and I'm miserable.

JOYCE
I have nothing. No husband, no
kids, and a lousy job. And I'm
fatter than all of you.

VICKY
What do you'want, Joyce?

JOYCE
Husband, kids, and no job. What
about you?

VICKY
I don't know... I used to do
advertising art. Patty says I
should go back to it.

JOYCE
Is that what you want?

VICKY
- I'd have to take some classes first.

JOYCE

So take some classes.
VICKY

I'd have to lose weight first.

JOYCE

VICKY

I was thinking... Calorie Counters?
Will you go with me?

They both think about it, as they scrape all the ice
eream off their plates and eat it.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING 34

Vicky has on a bulky dress and some junk jewelry --
necklace and bracelets. She is edgy as she checks
herself in the mirror and doesn't realize Jack is
taking a picture until the flash of his Polaroid
goes off,

VICKY
What're you doing?

JACK
That's the 'before' picture. When
you get down, I'll take the ‘after.'

And Vicky is more edgy.

VICKY
Did I tell you it's $10 for the first
time for registration? After that,
$5 a week?

JACK
You told me, and I'll pay it.

Vicky goes into the bathroom. We SEE her through the
open doorway. She gets on the scale and takes off
the jewelry, as:

VICKY
You have to pay the $5 even the
weeks I don't go.

back into the bedroom to test the weight of other
dresses in the closet, as:

JACK
Forget realistic. Lose weight.

A beat. Vicky looks at herself in the mirror.

VICKY
Jack... what do you see when you
look at me?
JACK
You trying to get out of going?
: VICKY
I'm not asking you to go to bed
with me... I want to know how you
feel about me.
JACK
I feel... Honest?
VICKY
Honest.
JACK

I feel... betrayed...

wondering.

INT. A CHURCH SOCIAL HALL - EVENING 35

Under a beautifully-lettered slogan, "God will pro-
vide is a crudely homemade one on paper, “But not

too well, please!" And under that ‘Calorie Counters."
The room is filled with people -- coming in, chatting,
standing in line to check in, and in another line to
get weighed. Joyce and Vicky, wearing a lightweight
sleeveless dress, reach the front of the check-in
line, and are greeted by SANDRA, tightly girdled

into a fairly nice figure. The check-in counter top

Joyce, Vicky and Ben are now together in line, in
that order. A woman, BETTY, 60 pounds overweight, is
in front of Joyce. They move up slowly as:

BEN
I'm giving it one more chance.
After that, I'll start saving up
for a by-pass.

JOYCE

the lecturer, BRAD, 30ish, very slender, and dressed
ultra-mod (with shirt open to the belt line, chains
around his neck, etc.), leads the group, singing, as
we PICK OUT Vicky, Joyce and Ben sitting toward the
back. Vicky is reading the song off a leaflet, but
Ben and Joyce know it, and sing along with less gusto
than most around them. Several people wear half-masks
of pigs' faces. Joyce and Ben hold their masks on
their laps.

happens there!

He starts for the door.

VICKY
Sure! Because you're saving
yourself for your chicks!

Jack, at the door, turns sharply.

JACK
That's what you think? That I'm
sleeping around?

VICKY
Aren't you?

JACK
I'm sure as hell thinking about it.

He drops the bedding on the floor and steps over it to
get to the closet. He takes out a sweater and goes
out of the room. A beat, and Vicky chases after him.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 41

Jack strides toward the front door, as Vicky appears
from the bedroom.

VICKY
Where are you going?

JACK
. Do you care?

He goes out and slams the door. A beat.

VICKY

door)
Not one damn bit!

And she stands, trying to breathe normally... looking
about as if what to do next... The kids peek from
behind a door.

No, I didn't mean...

She sobs, holds it back... the panic grows... what to
do... suddenly she bolts toward the kitchen.

INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT 42

Vicky stands at the refrigerator, staring, infuriated,
at two pictures that have been taped to it -- the
Polaroid shot Jack just took, and one of herself and
Jack on their honeymoon -- at a pool, in bathing
suits. Both young -- he, with a head full of hair,
she very slim. She tears the pictures down, rips
them up, pulls open the refrigerator door -- and it's
almost empty. Only some vegetables are inside.

Vicky stares at it... open mouthed, in horror. HOLD
on her.

My poor starving little orphans!

The kids tumble into her arms, for just a moment, and
then Danny goes to attack the food, as Helen guides
Lisa to the table,

HELEN

Come and sit down. Grandma won't
let you go to school without a
good breakfast.

Danny and Lisa are still finishing their breakfast, as
Helen shepherds them out the door. Vicky, still in her

blocking both sides of the driveway) as --

He's had a terrible night, and it shows, He starts
toward Helen's car, and she starts the motor.

HELEN 1

Hi, Jack... Goodbye, Jack...

LISA
I want to talk to Daddy.

As Helen drives, off, Jack stands near. the curb and
Vicky at the door, both waving goodbye. Then they look
at each other. Jack starts for the house, Vicky goes
inside and slams the door. Jack hesitates, takes a
breath for courage, and goes to the house.

Vicky cleans up the kids’ dishes, as Jack dogs after
her.

JACK

plods on --

JACK
I just want to do something to

We're CLOSE ON Vicky, as she jogs. She's in a sweat
suit, soaked with perspiration, but we can SEE she's
lost some weight. WIDEN THE SHOT TO INCLUDE Ben se-

behind. As they approach a street corner, Ben, then
Vicky, jog in place, waiting for a traffic light to
change. Joyce catches up, stops to rest,

Joyce and Ben sit, exhausted, on the bench at a table
in front of the hot dog stand, as Vicky looks at the
menu printed on the wall behind the counter, and an
ATTENDANT, a pimply youth, waits lethargically, to
serve her. The meager offering includes hot dogs,
fires, chips, and sugared soft drinks.

VICKY
Don't you have anything like...
cottage cheese... or a salad?

ATTENDANT
All we got'’s what's on the board,
lady.

dogs?

nearly nude. WIDEN THE SHOT TO INCLUDE several stu-
dents all drawing her with various degrees of ability

drawing is impressionistic. The model looks almost
Rubenesquely rounded. And then we SEE Vicky, near

off the frosting and hands the knife to Helen.

VICKY
You cut the cake.

HELEN
It's your husband's birthday!

VICKY
It's 500 calories a slice,

Jack is opening gag and real gifts in the b.g. as Vicky
and Helen watch from across the lawn. Vicky is really
low now, as:

HELEN
You won't eat his birthday cake,
you argue with him in front of
the guests, you.., you bring
hippies to his house! You know
what your father, may he rest in
peace, would say to you?

VICKY

He'd say, 'Leave Vicky alone,'

HELEN
Well, he'd be wrong, as usual.

VICKY
Mom,.. leave me alone.

HELEN
There you go, listening to your
father again!

Vicky almost answers, but instead turns away and starts
into the house. Mike, who'd been wandering on the out~-

couch, as Jack hurries to the house, Danny looks after
him, disappointed, Helen, disapproving, and everyone
else puzzled.

Jack marches into the house, as if he expects Vicky and
Mike to jump up guiltily. But they don't, they merely
look up. Mike's arm is around Vicky's shoulders, He
really has been consoling her, but that's not the way
Jack sees it. He glares at them a moment, then --

the breakfast tray: French toast laden with jelly,
plus juice and coffee.

HELEN
Breakfast.

She puts the tray on a chair, starts opening the drapes,
letting in the bright morning sunshine, as Vicky sits
up. She's puffy eyed and looks terrible. Helen comes
back to put the tray on Vicky's lap.

HELEN

When you were a little girl and
you went to bed crying about

French toast with jelly on it.

Vieky starts to eat, without enjoyment but rapidly.

That's how I felt when Jerry

at a man again. Then, when I
stopped crying, I realized 1
hadn't been that happy with him
in the first place.

Vicky looks out from the covers. As Helen gets on
the exercycle, she cycles, Vicky watches. Then:

VICKY
.. Why didn't you get married
again?

HELEN

I wanted a young man, not an old
goat... and all the men I met had
the same idea. Vicky, I was
forty-six when Jerry died. You're
only twenty-eight.

VICKY
Thirty-two.

HELEN
You don't have to broadcast that!
Go find yourself a nice young man
... with a decent job... and a
good future... Likes kids...
doesn't mind mother-in-laws...

As she talks, we FOCUS on Vicky, thinking.

Vicky, Patty and Joyce, carrying some things they've
already bought, walk along, looking in store windows.
Joyce is noticeably slimmer. Vicky keeps talking
MOS: as they pass a dress shop displaying lean manne-
quins in slinky clothes, Patty stops to look and then
catches up; at the Diet Dessertery Joyce stops to
look and then catches up, passing an advertising
board displaying a lean, gorgeous couple, eating
spaghetti at a candlelit gable. and in love. When

Patty and Joyce stop, looking at her meaningfully, and
vicky understands. She stops, too.

VICKY
(eontinuing)
Yeah...

They stop at three adjoining stores: Patty at a
furrier, Joyce at the lingerie shop and Vicky at an
appliance store where she looks at the TV displayed
in the window. A commercial is on: a before and
after ad for a reducing wafer, showing silhouettes of
a fat and slender woman. Vicky joins Joyce.

JOYCE
How would I look in that?

VICKY
Great, let's see if they have your
size.

EXT, THE MATTHEWS HOUSE - DAY 63

Jack drives a shiny new Mercedes up the driveway.
Danny and Lisa and piles of presents are in the back

Vicky's wagon and Helen's Ford parked side by side.
Jack doesn’t like his place being usurped.

Vicky and Jack walk around the Mercedes, admiring it.
Vicky is working hard to keep the casual pose, and
Jack is very nervous.

in a leotard, huffing and puffing, through a rigorous
exercise. But unlike the earlier gym scene, she's
doing it. WIDEN the SHOT and we're in...

INT. THE MAGIC CIRCLE GYM - DAY 73

The gym, like everything at this place, is a temple
to slimness and beauty. Soft colors, slender shapes
in furniture and decor, beautiful employees. A group
of women and some men, of varying sizes, from gorgeous
to mountainous, are doing exercises with a slender,
but muscular woman GYM INSTRUCTOR. The guests wear
a conglomeration of clothes from scruffy sweat suits
to plastic see-through sauna suits to revealing
bikinis. The Gym Instructor and some of the slimmer
people are watching themselves in the mirrored wall
-- the others, including Vicky, are not.

GYM INSTRUCTOR
And bounce and two and three and
four, other way, two and three
and four... and back and two...

Vicky falters, takes a breath, and starts again.

EXT. A JOGGING TRACK - DAY 74

The same group of people, now in jogging suits, one
of them a silver lame, are jogging -- or dragging --
around the track, behind a different instructor, a
slim young woman, A heavy man near the back sneaks
candy from his pocket as he runs. And further back,
a woman pulls an orange blossom from a tree and pops
it in her mouth. Vicky is near the middle. An at-
tractive muscular man, GARY, slows down to run beside
her, smiles at her. Vicky is surprised at first,

and then likes it and smiles back.

The massage goes on, and Vicky relaxes, smiling, very
pleased with herself.

INT. THE GYM - NIGHT 77

The participants are now in casual resort wear, learn-
ing disco dancing from the DISCO INSTRUCTOR, a very
slender chorus boy type. Vicky is keeping up better
than most -- and Gary is right beside her.

DISCO INSTRUCTOR
And dip... and again... and start
over -- front left, right, left,

INT. THE WEIGHTS GYM AND STEAM ROOMS - DAY 78

The floor and walls are covered with machines to pull
and tighten every muscle in the body. Three walls
are mirrored. The fourth leads to the jacuzzi, which
is an ell off the gym, and the sauna and steam room,
visible through steamy glass doors. Most of the
machines are in use -- a heavy woman is giggling as
the vibrating machine jiggles her bottom, a man
struggles unsuccessfully with a pulley, people on
slant boards do a variety of things with their arms
and legs. A man comes from the sauna, wrapped in a
towel, and nearly fainting -- a woman comes from the
steam room, also wrapped in towels and nearly faint-
ing -- they stumble past each other; he goes to the
steam room, she into the sauna. We MOVE IN CLOSER
to the jacuzzi. In the bubbling water, people relax
against the water jets, or swim lazily about. We
PICK OUT Vicky, sitting beside her jogging partner,
Gary.

I thought so, too...

Vicky hurriedly gets out of the jumpsuit and grabs
something from the closet to put on, 4 filmy negligee.

JACK.
(continuing)
Until I saw you.

Vicky realizes what she's doing, throws the negligee
into the closet and grabs a shapeless old chenille
robe.

VICKY
So... did you have any problems?

JACK
Yes... I missed you.

She turns away from him, getting the robe on, and
Jack hurries over from the bed. When she turns back,
he's face to face with her.

VICKY
Oh...!

She moves away from him, and he follows as:

JACK .
It's been a long time, Vicky.

VICKY
Not so long... actually...

He grabs at her, and pulls her to him,

JACK
I want you.

VICKY
Well, this is after. Get out of
my bedroom.

JACK

Surel... I pay for that fat farm,
and that... that hippy gets the

Vicky throws a pillow at him.

VICKY

JACK
You wouldn't take the weight off

Vicky throws another pillow.

Mike is painting at an easel and looks up to see Vicky,
very angry, at his open door. He looks at her
questioningly, and she slams the door hard. The bed
comes down.

MIKE
(looking her
over)
Hey, you look fantastic!

VICKY
Do you know what Jack said?

MIKE
No. And I don't want to.

VICKY

Neither do I.

And she starts for the bed, taking off her jacket at
the same time.
TIME LAPSE 91

Vicky and Mike are in bed, they've made love and are
now nestled in each other's arms.

MIKE
So what did Jack say?

VICKY
He said that I changed, that
I'm a different person.

MIKE
“You are.
VICKY
How?
MIKE

You're sure of yourself, you
know what you want.

VICKY

92 INT. AN ACADEMY CLASSROOM - DAY 92

Eric is showing samples of Vicky's work to FRANK
LESSER, a handsome, 40ish businessman... as Vicky
watches nervously, and Mike protectively. Frank is
interested in the work... but is more interested in
Vicky.

FRANK
(to Vicky)
You'd have to start as an
apprentice.

VICKY
Fine.

MIKE
No, I don't think so.

fully decorated for a wedding. Joyce and Ben stand
before the minister -- Joyce wearing her mother's
wedding dress. It's tight, but it fits, She's really
baggy-eyed and very sick looking, but also very happy.
As is Ben, also slimmer. Among the guests are Vicky
as matron of honor, standing close to the couple,
Helen next to her, and elsewhere -- Mike with Lisa
and Danny and Patty and Marge. A table laden with
rich food and liquor is at the back of the room, wait-
ing. Danny sneaks over for a taste as the ceremony

it's MOS again, as:

HELEN
Or, if you came to your senses,
you could get Jack back.

VICKY
I don't want Jack back.

HELEN
You can't support yourself.

VICKY
Mom, please --

HELEN
As bad as it was with your father,
at least I had someone to take care
of me.

Vicky looks at her sharply -- opens her mouth for a
sharp rebuttal -- and at that moment the ceremony is
over. Vicky and Helen are caught in the mob of people

going to congratulate the newlyweds, and others head-
ing for the food; they try to hear each other over
that.
VICKY
What was so bad about my father?
HELEN
What?
VICKY
(louder)
Why are you always picking on my
father?

A couple of people look their way, and Vicky, embar-
rassed, takes Helen's arm and steers her away from

ANGLE - OUTSIDE THE RESTROOMS IN THE CHAPEL 96
Vicky steers Helen toward the women's restroom.

HELEN
What are you doing?

Vicky opens the restroom door, but the room is packed
with women waiting their turn. She eloses the door on
them, and pushes Helen toward the men's restroom near-
by.
HELEN
(continuing)
I knew it, she's going crazy.

Just as they start to open the men's room door, a MAN
comes out, checking his fly.

through the crowd, accepting congratulations, and
gets to Mike.

JOYCE
Where's Vicky?

MIKE
In the men's room.

Joyce and Patty, near her, do takes, and Mike shrugs.

The giggling grows into a relieved guffaw. Vicky puts
her arms out, and Helen, like a little girl, goes into
them. They've reversed roles. Vicky rocks her gently,
as the laughter subsides.

102 BACK TO THE CHAPEL - AT THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR 102
There's a mob in front of the door now -- all staring

Ben enter and get into line as:

saying come on in, and eat those
gigantic plates full of stuff...
But!... But you'd better be skinny
when you're doing it, or you won't
be able to buy clothes you can

Half-crazed with worry and anger, now, he suddenly

grabs at a piece of cream pie... doesn't know what to
do with it.
BEN
(continuing)

Well... if that's what they want...

He suddenly puts the pie on his tray and begins to grab
more pie, and cake, and ice cream, and every no-no he
can see, and pile them in a precarious tower on his
tray, as:

directions.

(almost disappointed)
Well... well, that's great... but,
I'm just saying, it's all right
i

VICKY

JACK

tell you that I love you, no matter
how fat you are.

VICKY
(calmly)
I'm not fat.

JACK
But if you gain weight --

VICKY
I'm not gaining weight.

JACK
Good, I know that. I'm just saying --

VICKY
(looks for his
jacket)
I know what you're saying and I
don't want to hear it.

JACK
You're right, you don't need to
hear it.

Vicky nods her agreement and goes back to her tea.
Jack drapes his arms around her.

She moves

JACK
(continuing)
And you don't need Mike, and you
don't need that job either... You
need me, Vicky. And from now on,
I'm going to be here for you.

VICKY
(easing out of
his arms)
I don't need ‘you!

so that the table is between. them.

JACK
I've changed, Vicky. I understand
you now. I can help you. You do
need me!

VICKY
Like I need a hot fudge sundae.

She goes into the living room and Jack follows.

— What I need is more time to myself.
JACK
(solicitous)
You're tired.

VICKY
No -- I'm excited, and proud of
myself and I want to relish it
all alone,

At the door:

VICKY
(continuing)
I'm going to treat myself to a
long delicious bubble bath.

JACK
(coming on)
I'll serub your back.

VICKY
I can scrub my own back. I can
do anything.
(with growing
exuberance)
Anything!

She opens the door.

JACK

VICKY
(happily)
Right.

VICKY
Maybe.

VICKY
(warmly)
Good night, Jack.

She closes the door and leans on it, thinking. Then
she smiles... accepts what she's done... and likes it...
And then, gets a new idea. She grabs her purse, and
searches in it.

EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY 117

There are no cars in the driveway. Vicky's wagon is
still at the curb. Vicky rums out of the house, carry-
ing her keys. She hops into the wagon, pulls it into
the griveway - The garage door goes up. Vicky drives
inside, parking in the middle and taking up both sides.
The garage door lowers. We HOLD on that.

FADE OUT.
