CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of

THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile
across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE

Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE
PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.

At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the

THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we

her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of

Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the
Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone
to a table.

THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face
as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre
now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:

MAITRE D'HOTEL
Where is that gentleman's soup?

The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother

she in pain?,... Isn't the child
coming soon?,... Patience! It's easy
for you to talk... Get away?,... No,
I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's

like being in jail. Oh, I hope the
child comes along all right.

At the conclusion of Senf's speech, CAMERA MOVES TO

BOOTH.

Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching

desk. He enters booth and commences conversation:

 

PREYSING

Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off
the wire... No... I was talking to
Fredersdorf... What?,... Oh.
Hello!... Is that you dear?... How
is everything at home?... What do
you hear from the factory?... No...
How are the children?... I left my
shaving set at home... Yes, is your
father there?... Hello, father?...

Our stock has gone down twenty-three
points. If our merger with the Saxonia

doesn't go through -- I don't know
what we can do... Hello, hello...
yes, papa. Rely on me -- everything
depends on Manchester... If they
refuse to come in -- well, we will
be in bad shape... no... Rely on me,
I'll make it go through -- I'll make
it go through... Waiting?... Yes,

I'm still speaking...

THE CAMERA THEN PANS TO Suzette. Suzette is already in

Gaigern himself. Where are you?,...
Good... No -- first, I need money. I
need it right now. I have to make a

hope to do it tonight... at the
theatre or after the show... But

money!... Now, listen...

PAN TO KRINGELEIN - booth.

KRINGELEIN
Who is that, This is... Hello,
hello!... Who is that... Heinrich?

This is Kringelein. Hello, Heinrich.
This is Otto Kringelein. Hello! Can

you hear me?... I've got to speak
very quickly. Every minute costs two
marks ninety... What?... Otto

Kringelein! Yes, I'm in Berlin,
staying at the best hotel, the Grand
Hotel... No, don't you understand? I
want to explain, but I must do so
quickly, it costs so much. Please
don't interrupt me -- hello? Hello!
Listen! You know that will I made
before my operation? I gave it to

you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy
it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin
to see a great specialist about that
old trouble of mine... It's pretty
bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I
can't live much longer.

(louder)
I haven't long to live! That's what's
the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on
the line? No, it isn't nice to be
told a thing like that. All sorts of
things run through your head. I am
going to stay here in Berlin. I am
never coming back to Fredersdorf.
Never! I want to get something out
of life, too. You plague, and bother,
and save -- and all of a sudden you
are dead. Heinrich... You don't say
anything. I am in the Grand Hotel,
do you understand, the most expensive
hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a
room here. The very best people stay
here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I
saw him -- not five minutes after I
was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell
him exactly what I think of him.
Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all
my savings; my life insurance, too;
I cashed in all my policies, the
sick benefit fund, the old age
pension, the unemployment insurance,
the burial fund and everything...
What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich.
I have to hang up now. I have to pay
three times overcharge. Just think
Heinrich! There's music here all day
long. And in the evening, they go
around in full dress... Yes, sometimes
I have pain, but I can stand it.
Everything is frightfully expensive
here. You can imagine, the Grand

BARON

dances.
PIMENOV
Well -- last night was not so good.
BARON

I thought she was splendid!

PIMENOV
Yes -- but the audience.

At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement
Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the

Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time.

SENF
The train leaves at seven-thirty
Madam. That is the only through train --
the dining car goes along.

The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little
speaks volubly to his wife.
BARON

(sarcastically)
It's always so quiet here.
PIMENOV
If you occupied the room next to
Madam Grusinskaya, you would
appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.

BARON
My dear sir, I would gladly change
rooms with you.

PIMENOV

(effeminately)
No doubt you would, Baron. But do
you know, I'm quite indispensable to
her. I'm her ballet master and her
nurse. I hardly belong to myself
anymore. But, there you are, it's
Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring
her.

At that moment, Zinnowitz pushes past them.
ZINNOWITZ

Pardon me.

Zinnowitz.

Preysing steps quickly into scene.

PREYSING
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.

PREYSING
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from
Manchester.

ZINNOWITZ

No news yet?

PREYSING

No. No word.

ZINNOWITZ
Everything depends on the Manchester
merger.
PREYSING
I know -- I know.
ZINNOWITZ
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as

your lawyer I made it my business to
broach the matter ---

As they begin to move out of scene, Zinnowitz calls

Senf.
ZINNOWITZ
I'm expecting a young woman -- a
stenographer -- she will ask for Mr.

Preysing. Ask her to wait.

SENF
Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz.

As they move out of scene, telephone bell goes.

SENF

CLERK
No -- letters to two-eighty.

This just covers the scene.

PIMENOV
(looking up from his
letter -- glances
off at the doctor)
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You
know him?
BARON
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting
for something -- and nothing ever
comes.
PIMENOV
The war dropped him here and forgot
him.
BARON

Yes, I was in the war.

He turns as he hears the Baron say this.
He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the

then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get
Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the

desk, which adjoins that of Senf's.

to me -- I have no time.

Pan back to desk:

ROHNA

and gentleman, who
have just arrived)
If you will wait one moment, sir.

KRINGELEIN
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I
waited three days before I got a
room at all and what a room that is.

ROHNA

It's a very nice room and inexpensive,

sir.

KRINGELEIN
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to
live in -- when I came here did I
ask for a cheap room? Did I?

Rohna, sensing a scene with this strange dirty

little

gentleman, looks furtively around for the manager.

ROHNA
Just one moment, sir.

KRINGELEIN
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every
day is precious -- every hour --

Every minute.

Second Clerk is looking straight at him.

Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and

proceeds:

During this scene the manager has been talking with

MANAGER
Mr. Kringelein will take room number
one-seventy-six, one of our most
expensive rooms. It is large and on
the front with bath.

KRINGELEIN
(subdued -- exhausted --)
Does that mean that the bath is my
own? --- Private?
MANAGER

Certainly, sir.

KRINGELEIN
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks.
That's what I want -- a large room

on the front with a private bath --
Yes, that's what I want. I can pay
now if you like.
He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to

money.

DOCTOR
That will not be necessary.

The manager is instructing the bellboy to take

the new room.

Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who
noticed the money, stoops to pick it up.

In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat.

face)
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein --

BARON
I'm Baron von Gaigern.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, a Baron!

Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman

popular.

BARON
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.

KRINGELEIN
(turning to Doctor)
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor --
I am --
DOCTOR
I know -- I know -- when a man's

collar is an inch too big for him --
I know he is ill.

KRINGELEIN
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
(his finger goes
nervously to his
collar)

Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out.

At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand,
he has bought the evening papers.

PIMENOV
Well, Baron -- I must go and dress.

KRINGELEIN
(to doctor)
Is this gentleman a Baron, too?

PIMENOV

(laughing)
Unfortunately no.

The Manager comes into scene.

MANAGER
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.

KRINGELEIN
Again?

MANAGER
Please.

Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with

him.
At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm.
CHAUFFEUR
Have you a minute now?
BARON
No -- I told you not to come in this
lobby.
CHAUFFEUR
Time's getting short.
BARON
I've told you a hundred times not to
speak to me with a cigarette in your
mouth.
Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but
still

holds it in his hand.

CHAUFFEUR
I want to speak --

BARON

CHAUFFEUR
Yes, sir.

THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO

As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she
turns
around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is
looking
down at her. The look on her face is the look we often
see

on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed.

is an amusing exchange of glances between them.

BARON
He must be very nice.

FLAEMMCHEN
Who?

BARON
(gallantly)
Whoever is keeping you waiting.

FLAEMMCHEN
(indicating Preysing's
door)
Have you seen it?

BARON
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor --
really? That?
(indicating Preysing's
door)

FLAEMMCHEN
That.

BARON

You?

FLAEMMCHEN

Oh -- work!!

Oh!

fingers)
You know...
BARON
Oh... poor child. If you were free,

I'd ask you to come and have some
tea -- but --

FLAEMMCHEN
Tea would spoil my dinner.
(lightly)
One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil
it.

BARON
Reducing?
FLAEMMCHEN
(she turns invitingly)
No -- why? -- should I?
BARON
Lord no -- charming -- but why one

meal a day?

FLAEMMCHEN
(laughing in his face)
Money -- Ever heard of it?
BARON
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are

a...

stenographers earn little pennies?

FLAEMMCHEN
Very little.

BARON
Too bad.

Did you ever see a stenographer with
a decent frock on? -- One that she'd
bought herself?

BARON
Poor child --
(enthusiastically)
I wish I were free tonight -- we
could --

FLAEMMCHEN
(with invitation)
Aren't you?

BARON
(quickly)
What?
FLAEMMCHEN
Free --
BARON
(glancing up passage)
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow
though.
FLAEMMCHEN

Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?

BARON
Shall we say five o'clock --

FLAEMMCHEN
Where downstairs?

BARON
Yellow Room where they dance --

FLAEMMCHEN
You're very funny --

BARON
(with great meaning)
Yes? -- Tomorrow?

FLAEMMCHEN
Of course.

BARON
Really?
Flaemmchen laughs at him.

BARON
We'll dance.

FLAEMMCHEN
(slowly)
All right. We'll dance.

At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from

his
doorway at the end of the passage.
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
Baron -- Oh, Baron!
The Baron turns and looks off at ---
KRINGELEIN
Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant.

By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room.
Baron turns back for a moment.
BARON
(calling back quietly
to Suzette)

Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!

Suzette turns back into the room.

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains

drawn -- room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of
silence, except for distant music coming from the

Room below.

In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet
which she has been mending.

She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops

and looks off dramatically at...

GRUSINSKAYA

Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese
on the chaise-lounge.

Apparently she has changed her position, because the
which is outside the robe moves.

The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards
Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to

chaise-lounge and is looking down.
Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the

ceiling
and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.
SUZETTE'S VOICE
(quietly and reverently --
almost a whisper)
Madam has slept well.
GRUSINSKAYA
No, I have been awake -- thinking --

It is time.

GRUSINSKAYA
Always the performance -- every day

suddenly)
I think, Suzette, I have never been

of veronal which is
nearby)
Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.

Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be

Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He
deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood.

She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the
table and sits.

PIMENOV
It is time for the performance.

GRUSINSKAYA
(under her breath)
The performance -- the performance --
the performance.
(during this scene
the orchids fall to
the floor)

It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is
temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is
near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel

her a revulsion against the word performance.

PIMENOV
(tenderly -- as he
touches her shoulder
gently)
Poor little Lisevata -- she still
has her stage frights -- it will

pass.
Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her
hands, he
attempts to soothe her.

Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.

GRUSINSKAYA
It is not stage fright -- it's
something more --

PIMENOV
(tenderly)
What -- what is it? Last night...

GRUSINSKAYA
Last night?... There was no applause.

are dead -- it's finished.

 

There is a sudden knocking at the door.

PIMENOV
Meierheim --

The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the
room.

MEIERHEIM
What is this that you have cancelled
your car? Who am I that I should
wait like a fool at the door? And
here on a whim, you cancel your car.
Have you forgotten there is a
performance? Do you know the time?
Or, are we all mad? Am I your
manager?... Have we a contract? Have
we obligations? Am I blind?

..Or is that the time?

GRUSINSKAYA
I'm cancelling the engagement.

MEIERHEIM
Oh!

MEIERHEIM
Oh! Madam is cancelling the

Good heavens no. That'd create the
very worst impression. You must be
optimistic. You must convince them.
You know as well as I do that the
merger must go through.

PREYSING
Yes -- the merger must go through --
But I am used to making my deals on
a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am
an honest business man -- a good
husband and father -- I have a sense
of honor -- I have nothing to conceal.
I couldn't live happily otherwise.

ZINNOWITZ
Well, don't get excited about it. We
agreed that the merger with the

down on her she pulls herself together and seats
attention.

stenographer to be pretty -- if she
does her work well, -- seems so silly.
I don't know why they don't like
girls like me in offices. Personally
I hate offices -- I'd much rather be
in the movies.

He paces back and forth again.

she
must copy, picks it up quite naturally and reads it.

At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she

At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman,

at the open door.

Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come

The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds

at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork
for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see
is locked.

Telephone bell rings again.

Inspectress picks it up quickly.

INSPECTRESS
No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here...

GRUSINSKAYA

You could love me. It is so long

Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they
do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we
begin at the beginning? -- Have we
cigars -- water and everything?

Flaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little
table for
work is seen in several CLOSEUPS:

SCHWEIMANN
(with a wink to
Gerstenkorn)
Manchester is a very interesting
city, don't you think so, Preysing?

PREYSING
(stalling)
Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in
the textile industry naturally has
to know Manchester.

GERSTENKORN
There's a lot of business to be done
with the Manchester Cotton Company.
They've the whole English market
right in their hands. Have you any
connections with -- Manchester?

PREYSING
(quickly)
We have a good many connections in
England, naturally.

GERSTENKORN
I mean with the Manchester people?

PREYSING
(looking at Gerstenkorn
impudently)
We are here to discuss our merger.
Naturally I can make no statement at
this time. We must begin at the

beginning.
GERSTENKORN
(winking at Schweimann)
All right.
PREYSING

(far-away commencing

to read his report)
Since, on the eleventh of June, this
year -- when the first negotiations
for a merger between our respective
firms was entered into -- both parties
have fully agreed that this merger
can result only in mutual advantages.

INTERCUT this speech, which if played by Beery will be

interesting, with signals, winks and signs between the
other

three men.

GERSTENKORN
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!

PREYSING
I'm laying before you the last general
statement of our concern. Active

Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --

FLAEMMCHEN
Water -- seltzer, three or four

WAITZ

I can see this session is going to

PREYSING
Now to proceed with the projected

merger, the advantages for the Saxonia

are so obvious...

GERSTENKORN
Oh -- now let's talk like adults.
You want to tell us now a along story
of what your factory can do. We know
all that you could tell us and if
you tell the truth it wouldn't sound

PREYSING
We did not approach you.

from his hand --
losing his temper)
It isn't so -- this was a response
to a tentative feeler of your own.

ZINNOWITZ
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the
conference is already underway.

PREYSING
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz --
I'm at cross-purposes with these
gentlemen -- will you clear up the
situation?

ZINNOWITZ
But the situation is perfectly clear
If you will allow me --

How clear is Manchester?

ZINNOWITZ
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always,
I'm told.
(to Preysing)
Have you said anything about
Manchester, Mr. Preysing?

PREYSING
I can make no statement about
Manchester at this time.

ZINNOWITZ
Well -- gentlemen.
There is dead silence for a moment -- he clears his

throat,
commences in almost the same tone as Preysing.

ZINNOWITZ
Since, on the eleventh of June of
this year -- when the first

negotiations for a merger...

GERSTENKORN

voice -- with a sigh --

sits back)
Thank God we're beginning at the

takes glasses from

speaking, not reading)

NO SCENE 61

Sequence omitted from original script.

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines. Grusinskaya
reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe
about her. She speaks voluably.

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition
was in my blood -- no rest, no
stopping. We were drilled like little
soldiers -- We danced in the school
of the Imperial Ballet, in St.
Petersburg. I was little and slim
but hard as diamond -- a duty machine --
No rest, no stopping. And then -- I
became famous and whoever is famous
is alone... But why should I be
telling you this? Last night I did
not know you at all -- who are you,
really? -- I do not even know your
name.

BARON
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My
mother called me Flix.

GRUSINSKAYA
Flix. -- And how do you live? What
kind of a person are you?

BARON
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep
of a white flock -- I shall die on
the gallows.

GRUSINSKAYA
Really?

BARON
Really, I haven't a bit of character.
None at all.

GRUSINSKAYA
No?
BARON
When I was a little boy I was taught
to ride and be a gentleman -- at
school, it was a monastery, I learned
to pray and lie -- and ---
GRUSINSKAYA
And?
BARON

And then, in the war, to kill and
hide. That's all.

GRUSINSKAYA
And what do you do -- now?

BARON
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large
like a happy pig, devouring anything
of life that pleases me, I really
belong in jail

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
BARON
(seriously)

I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
(he turns away)

GRUSINSKAYA
That's a silly joke.

BARON
(turns -- takes both
her hands)
Please look at me. You must believe
me -- you must believe that I love
you -- that I have never known what
love is -- until last night.
(he releases her hands
and turns away again.)

GRUSINSKAYA
What is the matter?

He does not answer.

GRUSINSKAYA
Flix!

The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays

them
before her.

BARON
There.

GRUSINSKAYA

(with a little cry of
pain)

Oh --
(in the silence
Grusinskaya puts her
head in her hands
and thinks)

The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and

then
holds back.

GRUSINSKAYA

(softly)
Did you come here just -- just for
that? Oh -- it's horrible.

Pause.
She is suddenly cold.

GRUSINSKAYA
You may keep the pearls -- I don't
want them any more -- I'll make you
a present of them.

BARON
(passionately)
I don't want them now.

GRUSINSKAYA
(broken)
I'll not denounce you.
BARON

I know.
GRUSINSKAYA

So --
BARON

Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
GRUSINSKAYA

But now, you must go... I give you

the pearls. But now you must go ---

BARON
I wanted money desperately -- Can
you understand? -- That's why I wanted
the pearls. I was threatened -- I

was desperately in need of a certain
big sum of money. I've been following
you -- I've admired you. But I have
forced myself not to think about you --
Last night, at last, I managed to

came into your room and -- and now.
GRUSINSKAYA
(softly)
And now?
BARON

I couldn't go through with it.
(his head goes down

into her lap -- he
sighs:)
Remarkable.
His hand touches her hair -- tenderly.
BARON

Do you understand?

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes -- yes -- yes.

There is a sudden knock at the door.

GRUSINSKAYA
Quickly -- here.

With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to
the
bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens
the

door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses
Suzette.

GRUSINSKAYA
Good morning, Suzette.

SUZETTE

(delighted to see her
in a good mood)
Good morning, Madam.

She puts the coffee down on the table.

Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the
coffee

down on the table must necessarily push back the
heavily

crested cigarette case of the Baron.

SUZETTE
Madam has slept well?

GRUSINSKAYA
(enthusiastically)
Oh, yes, Suzette.

SUZETTE
Madam will dress now, it is late.

GRUSINSKAYA
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in
five minutes. I'll ring.

SUZETTE
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about
it.

She is a French woman. She is pleased.

SUZETTE
Madam is beautiful this morning.

As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says:

Yes, Suzette.

Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and

With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and
speaks.

charming light moment. She continues to speak into

BARON
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.

He leaves.

Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya

breathes
deeply, stretches herself. She goes to the glass and
looks
at herself -- smiling. Happily she takes the pearls,
kisses
them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the
telephone.
GRUSINSKAYA
(speaking into
telephone)
Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are
you, in your room? Come, I will see
you now... hurry.

She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is
humming a

tune. She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair
happily,

she is indeed younger.

Suzette is putting out a dark dress.

GRUSINSKAYA
Not that dark dress -- something
light -- bright -- it's a sunny

morning, Suzette.
Suzette happily glances at her.
There is a knock at the door.
GRUSINSKAYA
Come in.

Pimenov enters, before he can speak --

GRUSINSKAYA
Good morning, Pimenov.

PIMENOV
(a little puzzled at

Good morning, Gru -- your --

Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly

speaks:
GRUSINSKAYA
Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new
ballet -- it must have mad music --
I'll explain it to you later. But
now, hurry to the theatre -- I want
full rehearsal -- properties -- full
ballet and some musicians. Hurry --
Quickly. I will be there --
During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him,
she is

busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face.

Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette
shows him
the cigarette case on the table.

As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and
almost
sweeps Suzette to the door with him.

PIMENOV
Gru -- you are positively radiant.

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes, Pimenov.
(quickly to Suzette)
One minute, Suzette, I will call
you.

They leave.

Grusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the
telephone.

KRINGELEIN
For me? -- Oh, please, something

BARMAN
A Louisiana flip, sir?
KRINGELEIN
A Louisiana flip, that sounds very
nice -- sweet, eh? --
During the following speech Kringelein keeps reaching
for
the moustache that is not there. He is thoroughly
happy.
DOCTOR
What do you do in the Grand Hotel?
Eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do
business -- flirt a little -- dance

a little. A hundred doors to one

A Louisiana flip.

Yes -- that --

KRINGELEIN
A little strange, Baron.

FLAEMMCHEN
I'd given you up.

Sorry.

No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

KRINGELEIN
I had a very good opportunity, a
young lady asked me to dance -- I
ought to be able to dance, it seems
to be very important.

Yes -- I'd love to.

I feel sorry for him.

You're not a bit like you were

I fell in love last night -- the

Oh -- there's no real thing -- it

I thought that, too -- but I found
that it does. Come along, dance with

They bow stiffly.

PREYSING
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend
and not accept your invitation to
dance.

KRINGELEIN
I could not think of not accepting.

PREYSING

You say that you are employed by us
in Fredersdorf, and here you are in
Berlin, indulging in diversions which
ill befit your position and which

are very much beyond your means --—
Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein,
I think we will look into your books.

Kringelein stands watching Preysing, his eyes
narrowing.

FLAEMMCHEN
Now, children, no fighting -- save
that for the office. Let's have our
dance.

Kringelein. They
dance off)

PREYSING
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.

BARON
Oh, let the poor devil alone.

PREYSING
I did not ask your advice.

The two men eye each other; for a moment there might be

I think it would be much better if
you went away.

PREYSING
We shall see who remains here the

Kringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely:

KRINGELEIN
Over -- over so soon -- it has just
begun.
(he closes his eyes
suddenly)
Oh, the pain.

DOCTOR
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be
afraid.

KRINGELEIN
(mutteringly)
I'd like to live a little longer but --
I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...

BARON
(touching his shoulder
gently)
You'll be all right, Kringelein.
(he moves from the
bed -- takes out a
cigarette, moves to
the table. He seizes
his drink)

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
(out of scene)
My pocketbook... my money in it...

DOCTOR'S VOICE
What do you say -- what?

We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.

DOCTOR'S VOICE
You what -- Oh, isn't it there?

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost
my pocketbook.

Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward
them.

The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat.

DOCTOR
There is no pocketbook here... On
the floor probably.
(He glances down)

KRINGELEIN

More than fourteen thousand marks...

DOCTOR
(looking at Baron)
Fourteen thousand marks... One can
travel -- one's happiness might depend
on fourteen thousand marks -- don't
you think so, Baron?

BARON
(with a shrug)
Quite possibly.

At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at
the

ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts
up.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, I've got to find it.

The doctor goes to restrain him.

KRINGELEIN
I'm all right, Doctor. There's no
pain now -- only you don't know what

that money means to a man like me.
He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along
floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his
his condition, makes the situation tragic. He actually
under the card table.
The Doctor looks at the Baron.

The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him,

for money)
You don't know, because you've never
lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and

upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives

everything and pay cash for it. I

The foregoing speech is intercut with the following

is not a long speech:

The Baron watches. He throws his cigarette away -- he

him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing
for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all
time the Doctor watches.

The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting
conscience.

Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during
rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning

piercing, says:
DOCTOR
He must find his money, Baron.
(next time)
Mr. Kringelein should find his
pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?
These are two interjections.
And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled
sack of pain, his head down.
The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were
for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket
turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in
voice as he says:
BARON
Here -- here it is. Here's your

pocketbook, Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN
(his head coming up)
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found
it -- you found it for me, Baron.

BARON
(quickly)
Goodnight, Kringelein.
(he moves towards the

door.)
KRINGELEIN
No -- no please -- oh, don't go --
don't go -- don't leave me alone,
Baron.
DOCTOR

You've nothing to fear, Kringelein

KRINGELEIN
No.

BARON
Come, get up -- come let me help
you.

NOTE: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up

If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.

BARON
You're all right now -- it's very
late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
KRINGELEIN
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.

Baron bites his lip. It is the first and only time in
the

play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost
breaks.

Goodnight, Baron.

for the want of a little money.

FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM

Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one
burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the
door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She

Money!
KRINGELEIN
Yes, of course, -- money!
FLAEMMCHEN

You don't understand that do you?

KRINGELEIN

Of course I do -- I never knew what
money really meant till I started
spending it. Do you know --

(he is silent a moment)
I can hardly believe that anything
so beautiful should come to me from
Preysing -- I'll take care of you.
Will -- will you let me?
FLAEMMCHEN
What?

KRINGELEIN
You'll have a good time with me.
Want to? I've got enough money. Ten
thousand two hundred in my pocketbook.
Three thousand four hundred that I
won. It will last a long time. I can

win more -- we'll travel.

FLAEMMCHEN
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there
always.

KRINGELEIN

Wherever you like. Here I'll give
you the money I won, three thousand
four hundred. Later you can have

more.
FLAEMMCHEN
Later?
KRINGELEIN
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It
will not be long -- I'll not last

long. Will you stay with me until...

FLAEMMCHEN
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor,
he'll cure you. They can cure anything
these days.

KRINGELEIN
Do you believe that you will have a
better time with me than you would
with Preysing?

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh yes, of course.

KRINGELEIN
(takes her hands)
Do you like me better?

FLAEMMCHEN
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein --
a very good man.

Kringelein straightens, happy, inspired, a smile on his
face.
He assumes in his gestures. Takes the telephone.

KRINGELEIN

When is the next train leaving for

Paris? -- Yes... Get two tickets for
me... and my bill please... and the
lady's -- Miss Flaemm's.

We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll
have breakfast on the train.

At this moment Kringelein and Flaemmchen are coming out
the elevator, Kringelein is carrying his suitcase.

A bellboy attempts to take his bag but Kringelein,

confused draws his hand with the suitcase away from the

FLAEMMCHEN
Let him take it.

Hearing the word 'Excellency' Kringelein goes through a
