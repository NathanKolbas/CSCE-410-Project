FADE IN:
INT. SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON - CREDIT MONTAGE - NIGHT 1

A SERIES OF VERY TIGHT CLOSEUPS: a convict, FRANK
BEACHUM, is being examined by a prison doctor, DOCTOR
ROGER WATERS. We do not see his face until the end of
the sequence. Instead we see only the parts of his body
that are being examined, and from these we can tell that
he is black, well-muscled, and in his late twenties.
CLOSEUP ON his chest as his prison shirt (stenciled CP-
133) comes off.

A stethoscope against his chest.
Dr. Waters looking down at his watch.
Second hand of the watch.

DR. WATERS (0.S.)
Sixty-five. Normal.

The prisoner's muscular arm, with a blood-pressure cuff
on it. Dr. Waters rips off the cuff. Underneath is a
mean-looking tattoo of a bleeding heart with a knife
through it.

DR. WATERS (0.S.)
Blood pressure, one twenty over seventy-
five. Normal.

The prisoner's legs. Dr. Waters taps his knee with a
reflex hammer.

DR. WATERS (0.S.)
Reflexes normal.

The prisoner's mouth, open, with a tongue depressor stuck
in it. The prisoner gags: "Agh!"

DR. WATERS (0.S.)
Looks fine. Healthy as a horse.

CLOSEUP of a clock on the wall: 10:17.

The face of LUTHER PLUNKITT, the San Quentin Prison
warden, watching the examination, and then looking at the
clock. Plunkitt is white, fortyish, and a little soft in
the gut. He's seen enough in his years at San Quentin to
be neither a pushover nor a martinet. To him, the exam is
routine, but he's also mindful of its significance: It's
the final exam before Beachum's execution in about twenty-
six hours. He nods toward a guard who is sitting at a
typewriter. The guard types.

CLOSEUP of the page in the typewriter. It's the
prisoner's chronological.

CONTINUED:
The guard types: "22:17 -- med exam completed."

DR. WATERS
Just one more thing, Luther.

Plunkitt looks at the doctor. Then at Beachum.
PLUNKITT

You gotta whizz in the cup, Frank. Then

we're done.
CLOSEUP of Beachum's face. We see that he is young, and
that he might have been scary once -- might, in fact,
have been someone's worst nightmare. Now there's
something else in his face: a terrible weariness,
hopelessness mingled with the struggle against fear.
As the CREDITS END, the clock on the wall ticks to 10:18.

CUT TO:

OMITTED
EXT. DEAD MAN'S CURVE - NIGHT

A stretch of parkway that swings to the left at an acute
angle. A gas station, closed, is situated to the right
of the turn's apex. Warning signs and blinking yellow
lights.

INT. GORDON'S BAR - NIGHT

The warm wooden interior is hung with lanterns and ads
for microbrews. At the bar sits STEVE EVERETT, a
newspaperman with the face of a smart-ass. He has wicked
eyebrows and a wicked smile. Everett is thin-waisted,
broad-shouldered, and muscular from lifting weights. He
is having a drink -- a non-alcoholic drink -- with
MICHELLE ZIEGLER, a novice reporter who is very young,
very alluring, and very ambitious. Her skirt is too
short, and her lustrous eyes gleam with the superiority
of the recent college graduate.

MICHELLE
Well, fuck ‘em.

EVERETT
(sighing)
Oh, God. Now we're going to talk
journalism.

MICHELLE
You call this journalism? You're
telling me that --

EVERETT
Michelle, it's been a long weekend.
People kept shooting each other. I kept
writing about it...

MICHELLE
I'm serious. I've had enough of this
crap. I'm going back to school, get my
Ph.D. -- write things that matter.

EVERETT
Michelle, I hate to break this to you,
but you're twenty-three. You don't know
anything that matters.

MICHELLE
(laughing)
And fuck you too, Ev.
EVERETT
All right, pull up a shoulder. What'd
they do to you?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

MICHELLE
Not they. He -- Alan. Killed my
sidebar on the Frank Beachum murder. If
you ask me, something about the whole
case stinks anyway, but what I was
trying to get at --

EVERETT
Michelle, I read that sidebar --

MICHELLE
Hey, it was good, Ev. You gotta admit.
Best stuff I've written in months.

EVERETT
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the piece
about!-- now don't let me fuck this up:

‘the media glorified Beachum's victim in
order to mask our patriarchal
culture...’

MICHELLE
Which created the very violence that
destroyed her! Exactly!

EVERETT

Alan shouldn't have killed it like that.
MICHELLE

Fuckin' A.
EVERETT

I would have tortured it first.

Michelle laughs in spite of herself and gives Everett a
naughty look.

MICHELLE
It might've enjoyed that.

EVERETT
Honey, it would have begged for more.

The bartender, NEIL, pokes his head over the bar.

NEIL
‘Nother round?

EVERETT
Yeah, Neil. Margarita for the lady, and
my usual.

NEIL

Not your usual usual.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

EVERETT
My new, improved usual.

NEIL
Virgin Mary.

EVERETT

Yeah. Heavy on the virgin.

Michelle looks at him curiously.

MICHELLE
Tell me something, Ev. If you're such a
hot shit, what are you doing stuck here
in Bumfuck, California?

EVERETT
(sliding closer)
Looking for love.

She lets him put his arm around her.

MICHELLE
Well, you've come to all the wrong
places.
EVERETT
(closer)

Not from where I sit.

For a moment they melt into each other's arms. Then
Michelle pulls away.

MICHELLE
No. Unh-unh. Not smart.

EVERETT
What's smart got to do with it?

MICHELLE
I gotta go. I can't do this. You're
married and you're -- I can't do this!

She gets up and wobbles out of the bar. Everett watches

her, more amused than sorry. He glances at the
bartender, Neil, who is just arriving with the drinks.

Neil shrugs.

NEIL
Next time.

EVERETT
(winking)
Next time for sure.

EXT. GORDON'S BAR - NIGHT (LIGHT RAIN) 5

Michelle exits into the rain, a sexy little grin on her
face: "Next time for sure."

INT. MICHELLE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT (LIGHT RAIN) 6
Michelle is driving, still smiling to herself.
MICHELLE'S POV 7

THROUGH her windshield, smeared, the wipers ragged, the
road barely visible.

INT. MICHELLE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT (RAIN) 8
Michelle turns ON the RADIO. ALTERNATIVE ROCK pumps into
the car. Michelle responds enthusiastically, dancing in
her bucket seat, beating on the steering wheel. She's
feeling good.

EXT./INT. DEAD MAN'S CURVE - NIGHT (RAIN) 9
The same angle as before. It's coming up much too

quickly. The car's tire catches the edge of a retaining
wall and jerks sideways.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. MICHELLE'S CAR - NIGHT (RAIN) 10

Michelle swings the wheel violently; the car zig-zags and
slides sideways into the gas station lot. The wall of
the station hurtles toward us.

MICHELLE
Please!

The CAR SMASHES head-on into the wall.

Michelle rips through the windshield; the GLASS EXPLODES
outward. The GRIND of METAL AGAINST METAL, and then,
gradually, the NOISE SUBSIDES. The smoke settles,
revealing a hole in the windshield framed by a crumpled
steering column. The HISS of hot, leaking FLUIDS SLOWLY
SEGUES INTO...

... the sound of a POWER MOWER.

BEACHUM'S POV
Green grass, sunshine, a small white house against a blue
sky. BONNIE, a pleasant-looking young black woman, calls
to him from the barbecue. In her hand is a small brown
object, which she waggles back and forth. From under the
sound of the mower, the COOING of a BABY. We LOOK DOWN
AND TO THE RIGHT: There's a plastic sandbox shaped like
a turtle, and in it is Frank's little daughter, GAIL,
whacking the sand with her shovel and cooing at her
father. Beachum's gaze returns to Bonnie, still calling
to him, waggling something.
BACK TO SCENE
BEACHUM
What?... Just hold on. I can't hear
you.

The sound of the LAWN MOWER GRADUALLY TURNS INTO a
CLACKING sound -- the sound of a TYPEWRITER.

END OF DREAM SEQUENCE.

ANGLE ON PRISON TYPEWRITER

We see the chronological being typed:

"6:21 -- prisoner awakes."

ANGLE ON BEACHUM'S FACE

His eyes fly open. He jerks up, looking around him.

INT. DEATH ROW - MORNING

Through the bars he sees the duty officer, REEDY, typing.

REEDY
Morning, Frank.

Beachum nods.

REEDY
Can I get you anything? Some breakfast?

Beachum sags, pulls himself up, struggles to answer.

BEACHUM
If you got, like, a roll? Some coffee?

REEDY
We'll get that right away, Frank.

Reedy types, then gets up and murmurs to another guard
stationed outside the cell. Then Reedy sits down and
types again. We see the words: "6:24 -- Breakfast order
relayed to CO Drummond."

INT. OAKLAND TRIBUNE - PRESSROOM - MORNING 14

We're in the bowels of the building. Two large presses
crank out the next edition. It's hot and noisy and dirty
down here, just the way ALAN MANN likes it. Alan emerges
from the cafeteria carrying an extra large Styrofoam cup
of coffee. He stops to schmooze with the guys who run
the presses -- newspaper guys, ink-stained and tough.
Alan is tall and broad-shouldered, with a belly that
hangs over his belt; he looks like an athlete gone to
seed. He's the newspaper's editor-in-chief.

BOB FINDLEY, the city editor, is younger and softer. As
he approaches Alan, he is wearing a neatly-pressed pink
shirt and a cheerful tie; no jacket. Bob composes his
face and takes a deep breath. He prides himself on being
caring. Just now, he has the look of a man who is about
to impart some serious news.

BOB
You hear?
ALAN
Yeah.
BOB
What a tragedy.
INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING 15

They enter. Alan punches "four" with his free hand and
impatiently stabs at the "close door" button.

ALAN
What was she, drunk?
BOB
(a pained smile)
I don't know. It was up at -- you know,

that vicious turn onto the parkway?
They ought to do something about that
place.

(CONTINUED)
15

CONTINUED: 15

ALAN
Do we have to cover for her? Did she
have anything big on?

BOB
She had that interview with Frank
Beachum at San Quentin. Then she was
going to witness the execution tonight.

ALAN
Christ.

BOB
It's a little worse for Michelle, Alan.

INT. NEWSROOM - MORNING 16

A large, chaotic open space partitioned into smaller
cubicles. Alan crosses the city section where a handful
of reporters are making phone calls and pecking away at
computer keyboards. Bob follows, a few paces behind.

BOB
I don't know if the warden'1ll go for a
replacement on the interview with
Beachum. But I thought I'd take Harvey
off the fraud meeting and --

ALAN
Put Everett on it.

BOB
Steve? Uh, Steve's got the day off.

ALAN
Not any more he hasn't. He can do the
interview, then he can witness the
execution. What's-his-face, the warden
down at San Quentin -- Plunkitt.
Steve's dealt with him before. I can
get him in.

They pass JANE MARCH, Bob's assistant. She catches his
eye and offers a sympathetic look: ‘What a tragedy."

INT. ALAN MANN'S OFFICE - MORNING 17

Alan strides in, with Bob right behind him. Bob shuts
the door. Alan stands behind his desk.

ALAN
You think Everett's an asshole.

(CONTINUED)
TRUE CRIME - Rev. 5/11/98 10.
17 CONTINUED: 17

BOB
I don't think he's an asshole.

ALAN
You're wrong. He is an asshole. Trust
me: I know him. A lot of people who're
good at their jobs are assholes, Bob.

Alan plunks himself into his seat, reaches into his
inside coat pocket, and removes a packet of crumb cake,
which he slams down on the desk as though making a
declaration. He opens his coffee and looks up
expectantly at Bob.

BOB
(earnestly)
I know that, Alan. It's just, Everett
thinks everything's a big investigative
witch hunt. Like on that Mike Vargas
piece --

ALAN
He was a drunk then. He's not now.

BOB
Right. Two months ago he was a drunk,
now he's sober -- if you say so, Alan.
Anyway, that's beside the point. The
point is, this isn't a Steve Everett
slash-and-burn job. It's a sidebar.
It's an issue piece.

ALAN
(wide-eyed)
Ooh! An issue piece! Well, dog my
cats!

BOB
Come on, Alan. Capital punishment --
you know. I mean, the state is putting
aman to death tonight. Killing a human
being.

ALAN
(enjoying this)
Oh, well, stop the presses! Hey, was
Amy whatsherface, the pregnant broad old
Frankie shot in the chest -- was she a
human being? Is that part of the issue?

BOB
Okay, yeah. That's part of the issue.

ALAN
Crumb cake?
(CONTINUED )
11.
17 CONTINUED: (2) 17

BOB
No. No.

ALAN
Let me tell you something, Bob. Issues
are the shit we make up to give us an
excuse to run good stories. Judge grabs
a female attorney's tits, that's the sex
discrimination issue. Nine-year-old
kills his brother with an Uzi, that's
the child violence issue. People want
to read about sex organs and blood. We
make up issues so they don't have to
feel too nasty about it.

BOB
I guess I should call Steve Everett
then. Because that's his attitude
exactly.

ALAN

(leaning back)
Bob, you've been here, what? Three
months now? I've been working with
Steve Everett for three and a half
years, and let me tell you something:
The guy is good, as good as I've ever
seen. You know why he was kicked out of
New York? You know the story?

BOB
I've heard a coupla things.

ALAN
Steve Everett busted the mayor, Bob.
The mayor of fucking New York City.
Steve got hold of a secret memo on a
contract bribe between Hizzoner and one
of the ex-borough presidents, and he ran
with it in his column.

BOB
So?

ALAN
The paper tried to kill it, ‘cause the
owner was in bed with the mayor. So
what'd Everett do? Didn't whine --
didn't back down, either. He walked.

A long silence. Bob shoves his hands in his pockets.

BOB
All right. All right, it's your paper.

ALAN
And, Bob -- when you send flowers to the
girl's family, would you include my
name? Thanks. 'Preciate it.

Bob goes out. Alan watches him for a moment, smiles and
shakes his head.

ALAN
Gullible bastard.

INT. BATHROOM - CLOSE ON TOILET - MORNING 18

where Everett, stark naked, is emptying an ashtray.

Butts fall into the bowl, and then we see hands using
toilet paper to wipe out the ashes. We hear Everett's
voice, as though he's talking to someone in another room.

EVERETT (0.S.)
Hey, I could have been happy in New York
forever -- They were about to let me run
the investigative team. That would have
put me on the Pulitzer track.

He finishes the job and emerges into the adjoining
bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 19

On the mussed bed, looking wondrously shapely and
wondrously naked, is PATRICIA FINDLEY, Bob's wife. She
watches Everett's approach admiringly, but there is
something sardonic in her smile. Everett puts the
ashtray on a bedside table.

EVERETT
It was a nice life -- Broadway shows,
downtown clubs, Elaine's every night,
veal chops up the wazoo.

He does a little dance, singing James Brown's "Got the

Feeling," playing imaginary maracas.
EVERETT
‘Baby, baby, baa-by. Baby, baby, baa-
by. Baby, baby, baa-by.' ‘Course, they

never served anything like this.
He swoops down and bites Patricia on the buttock.
PATRICIA
Ooh! Now you have to kiss it and make
it better.

(CONTINUED)
13.
19 CONTINUED: 19
Everett does. And while he's still kissing:

PATRICIA
So you were the king of New York. Why
are you hacking out Metro stories at the
Oakland Tribune?

EVERETT
Got caught in the supply room with a
seventeen-year-old desk assistant.

PATRICIA
No!

EVERETT
Yup. Turned out to be the daughter of
the paper's owner. Blackballed me all
over town.

PATRICIA
You bad man! What'd your wife say?

EVERETT
(not without pain)
Well, we'd just had the kid, you know.
It was tough on her, but she wanted to
keep us together. And when Alan said
he'd take me on, I guess she figured,
you know, another town, another change.

PATRICIA
You bad man. First the owner's
daughter. Now the editor's wife. Do I
detect a hostility toward authority
figures?

EVERETT
Only the ones I work for.

PATRICIA
And is that what you're going to say in
the next city, with someone else?
(imitating him)
Oh, I got caught with the editor's wife.
You know how that is.

Everett gets up and begins pulling on his pants.
EVERETT
I get caught with you, I don't know how
many other cities will have me.

Patricia watches him dress, affecting a pout.

(CONTINUED)
14.
19 CONTINUED: (2) 19

PATRICIA
So playtime's over?

EVERETT
You gotta get to work. I gotta get
home. See if the wife and kid still
recognize me.

PATRICIA
You're not going to tell me how awful
we're being, are you?

EVERETT
Well... Bob's a decent guy. Good
newspaperman. Solid editor.

PATRICIA
So this all just stinks, right? What
we're doing.

EVERETT
You and me, Patricia, we're just two
simple people swept away in a whirlwind
of passion. Something like that.

Everett finishes putting on his shirt and bends over to
give her a kiss. Then he turns away, looking for his
wallet and keys.

PATRICIA
Look, it's all right. It's not like I
love you or anything.
EVERETT
(smiling)
Thanks. I don't love you too.
The PHONE RINGS. She picks it up.

PATRICIA
Hello? Uh... All right...

Everett makes for the door, blowing her a kiss and

mouthing a "bye." But Patricia holds up her index
finger: "Wait a second."
PATRICIA
(on the phone)
Yes... yes, all right.

She hangs up and then looks at Everett, who is waiting
expectantly.

Everett is stunned.

Who told him?

How the hell should I know?

Everett looks at her, hard. He wheels and heads out the
door.

INT. SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON - DEATHWATCH CELL - DAY 21

Plunkitt steps into the cell. Reedy stands in front of
his typewriter. Plunkitt nods and turns toward the
prisoner.

Beachum sits at a small table behind a wall of bars. The
table is covered with several sheets of paper and a Bic
pen. Beachum holds a cigarette between two of his
fingers, sending a zig-zag of smoke to the ceiling. The
ash has grown long. It drops to the table of its own
weight. Beachum doesn't move his hand at all.

PLUNKITT
Morning, Frank.

BEACHUM
(softly,
respectfully)
Mr. Plunkitt.
PLUNKITT
Anything I can get for you? Anything
you need?
BEACHUM

No. Can't think of nothin’.
Beachum is eerily still, his eyes cast to the floor.

PLUNKITT
There're some matters I gotta discuss
with you. Figure we do it first thing,
get it out of the way.

Frank nods slowly, as if it were a very great effort.

PLUNKITT
Your dinner tonight, for one thing. It
can be pretty much anything you want.

Frank nods again. More ash falls to the floor.

PLUNKITT
You go ‘head and tell Reedy here when
you decide. Now, about your personal
effects and belongings --

BEACHUM
My wife'll take ‘em.

PLUNKITT
And your remains? Does that go for your
remains, too? Because if she can't
afford the funeral expenses --

BEACHUM
No, no. Her church raised some money.
It's all right.

PLUNKITT
So your wife will be claiming your
remains, then.

Frank draws a breath. He straightens slightly and his
plastic chair scrapes the floor. Plunkitt winces a bit
at the sound.

BEACHUM
Yes sir, that's right.

TRUE CRIME - Rev. 5/11/98 17.
21 CONTINUED: (2) 21

PLUNKITT
Okay. Now, I want to give you some idea
here of what's going to happen tonight.
We'll have to ask your visitors to leave
at seven P.M. You'll be given your
dinner and a fresh set of clothes.
There's a sort of plastic underwear
thing we have to ask you to put on. No
one'll be able to see it or anything,
but we need it for sanitary purposes.
We'll make sure it's removed before your
wife claims the body.

Plunkitt pauses and stares at Beachum's cigarette, at the
ash lengthening on the end of it. Then he snaps himself
back.

PLUNKITT
We'll come for you, oh, about a half
hour before the procedure. You'll be
taken into the procedure room and
they'1l hook an E.K.G. up to you and
the intravenous lines at that time.
But nothing's gonna happen early or
anything. Right up until 12:01,
we'll be monitoring the phones.
We got open lines to the attorney
general and the governor, and those'll
be checked right through to make sure
they're in working order. You got
any questions about any of that?

BEACHUM
(very, very quietly)
No.

PLUNKITT
Now, there's just one more thing, and
then I'll leave you in peace here. It's
about the sedative.

Beachum stiffens. The line of smoke coming up from his
cigarette smears as his hand shakes.

BEACHUM
I don't want no sedative.

PLUNKITT
Sedative's completely optional, Frank.
I would just like to advise you that it
can make things a whole lot easier.

I appreciate it, Mr. Plunkitt. But I
wanna be clear in my mind. When I see
my wife, I wanna be clear for that. All
right?

PLUNKITT
Fair enough. You change your mind, you
let the duty officer know. I just had
to give you my little sales talk, is
all.

Beachum keeps his eyes lowered, watching his hands. The
cigarette has burned down to the filter, and Plunkitt
stands there a moment, looking nervously at it. Finally
Beachum reaches to the tinfoil ashtray next to him and
crushes it out.

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY 22

Plunkitt is met by his deputy warden, ARNOLD McCARDLE.
Arnold is a jolly fellow with sparkling eyes and a
three-hundred-pound frame. Reading notes from a folder,
he breathes heavily, keeping pace with Plunkitt.

McCARDLE
Badges'1l go down to the gate at nine.
Got the witness list. What else?
Roadblocks are up. Demonstrators are
light so far.

PLUNKITT
Visitors all squared away?
McCARDLE
Wife and kid. Your girlfriend from the
‘News,' Michelle Ziegler -- she's coming
at four.
PLUNKITT
Mea culpa. She was pretty persuasive.
McCARDLE
Hey, let her persuade me next time,

would ya?

Plunkitt gives him a look. They approach the death
chamber. Plunkitt pauses.

PLUNKITT

mostly I think about doing my job.

Plunkitt nods. "Of course, that's right." He opens the
door and ushers McCardle into the death chamber.

INT. DEATH CHAMBER - DAY 23

REUBEN SKYCOCK, the prison's maintenance engineer, is
fussing with the stainless-steel lethal-injection
equipment, checking his toggles, stopwatch, and signal
lights.

As Plunkitt and McCardle move toward the machine, a
SHEET-COVERED FIGURE on the gurney suddenly thrusts
upward into a sitting position.

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER ATKINS

Warden! Sir! I repent!

McCARDLE

Jesus, Atkins! Jesus God!

Plunkitt turns away. He's a little shaken and would
rather the others not notice.

EXT. OAKLAND TRIBUNE BUILDING - DAY 24

The PUSSY MAN: a middle-aged homeless man, reeking of
wine and urine, in a filthy gray overcoat, his yellow
eyes streaked with red. He is romancing every passing
female.

PUSSY MAN
Gimme some of that pussy, baby. You got
pussy on toast. I need some pussy on
toast, baby. Gimme some of your pussy

Everett approaches the entrance.

PUSSY MAN

You could give me a hundred dollars, you

A woman passes. The Pussy Man jerks toward her.

Hey, sister, I know you got some sweet

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY 25

As Everett enters, he sees Bob Findley watching him from
the city desk at the far end of the room. Suddenly
Everett is terribly self-conscious; every step feels
wrong. He walks, hands in pocket, as casually as he can.
As he reaches the city desk, Jane March looks at him,
looks at Bob, looks back at him.

EVERETT
Morning, all. Heh!

He clears his throat. Silence. Bob stares at him.

BOB
You got my message.
EVERETT
Uh. Yeah.
BOB
Apparently, it seems we have a problem,

Everett wasn't expecting this. The news knocks the wind
out of him. He holds onto the desk to steady himself.

EVERETT
What? Michelle? I was just -- I saw
her last night. We were... Fuck! She

was just twenty-three or something.

JANE
Dead Man's Curve.

EVERETT
Jesus. Poor kid. Just got out of
school. She was twenty-three or
something. I should have...

A long moment. They all look away from each other.

BOB
(watching him)
Michelle had an interview scheduled
today with Frank Beachum.

EVERETT
(still stunned)
What?
(beat)
Oh, Beachum. The guy they're gonna
juice today. Yeah. She said she had a
seat for the show. Poor kid.

BOB
She also had an interview with him. At
four, face-to-face in the Deathwatch
cell. Alan wants you to cover for her.

EVERETT
(still stunned)
Right. Sure. Oh man! So... okay.
Beachum. Killed a pregnant girl or
something.

BOB
A college student. Amy Wilson She was
working the summer in Richmond, place
called Pocum's Grocery. Owed Beachum
ninety-six bucks or something -- repairs
he'd done on her car. He shot her dead.

EVERETT
Nice. Anything special about him?

BOB
Black, tough. Mechanic over at the
Amoco station on Clayton.

Jane is reading the Beachum file.

Cynical.

SERIES OF SHOTS 26

Raw and grainy, with a video feel, like something out of
the TV show "Cops." The shots are punctuated with
flashes of light, as though from police flashbulbs.

JANE (V.O.)

Came from Michigan -- broken home,
alcoholic mother. He'd been in and out
of jails, violent assaults, barroom
fights, drugs, more drugs. Did two
years in the state pen for beating up a
cop who tried to give him a ticket --

EVERETT (V.O.)
Sounds like a reasonable young fellow.

JANE (V.O.)
-- and then another three for breaking
into a convenience store.

Beachum walks in, looking cold and intent. He walks
up to the counter.

EVERETT (V.O.)
Let me guess. Frank says, ‘Where's the
ninety-six bucks you owe me?' She says,

‘I ain't got it, Mr. Beachum, sir.' And

Jane is perusing the file.

JANE
Nope. Get this. He still says he just
went to the store for some
A-1 Steak Sauce.

EVERETT
A-1 Sauce. Nice touch.
JANE
Looks like Nussbaum had two strong
witnesses.
EVERETT
Black or white?
JANE

Uh, let's see. Both white, looks like.
Woman in the parking lot who saw him
running away. And then this poor guy
who drives in because his car
overheated, he goes in the store to use
the phone, and there's Beachum standing
over the body, gun in hand, blood all
over him.

BOB
Okay, okay, don't overload him. All I
want is the human interest, all right?
Death row, the final day, what's it
like.

EVERETT
No problem. Uh, Bob? That's all you
need from me. Right?

BOB
(too deliberately)
That's all, Steve.

EVERETT
Okay, Bob. Hokey-dokey. I'1l be...
I'll get... right on it.

He turns and begins to walk away, pure relief on his
face. Then he stops. Something is bugging him. He can
feel Bob's eyes on his back. The smart thing to do would
be to forget about it. But something is sticking in
Everett's craw. Slowly, he turns.

BOB
Something more you want to talk about,

EVERETT

Yeah. Uh... that witness, the guy who
drove in and then found Beachum standing
over the body. Well, he must have heard
the shots, right?

BOB
(much too softly)
The shots.

EVERETT
Yeah. I mean, his car is overheating,
he drives into the parking lot, gets
out, probably opens the hood, sees the
engine steaming, walks in the store.
See, if a shooting was going on all that
time, he must have heard the shots.

JANE
So he heard the shots.

A long pause. Bob stands very still, growing redder by
the second. His jaw is very, very tense. Jane watches
him like a bus passenger sitting next to a ticking
parcel.

I don't know, Steve. I don't know if he
heard the shots or not. Maybe he did.

just do that please?

EVERETT
Yup. Yeah. You bet, Bob. Right.

BOB
Thank you.

Everett turns on his heel. Jane lets out a long breath.
Everett zips back down the aisle. Jane nods at Bob and
follows him.

AT EVERETT'S DESK - DAY 28

Grubby, cigarette-scarred, littered with papers, Chinese
takeout containers, a picture of his wife and son, a tape
recorder.

Everett sits in his swivel chair, examining the Beachum
file on his computer. Jane appears carrying files and
disks and tapes.

JANE
Close one. I don't know what you did to
him, but he's on your case. I figure we
were about two seconds away from a full
Bob Findley explosion.

Everett grins, shakes his head, and reaches toward his
shirt pocket, half-pulling out a pack of cigarettes.
Jane looks at him in alarm.

JANE
What are you, crazy? You're gonna light
up now, after Bob's big no-smoking
speech last week?

EVERETT
I missed it.

Everett grabs Michelle's files. The first thing he
seizes upon is a tape cassette marked "Beachum." He
slams it into his recorder and stuffs the earphone in his
ear.

ANGLE ON EVERETT'S COMPUTER SCREEN

The Beachum file. As Everett listens to Michelle's tape,
he flashes to various photos and newspaper clippings on
his computer screen.

MICHELLE (V.O.)
Beachum case. Okay. Victim, Amy
Wilson, married, twenty-year-old coed,
shot in the chest with a .38 as she
stood behind her counter at Pocum's
grocery in Richmond. Six months pregnant
at the time; both she and the baby died.
Okay, let's see. Two witnesses.
Um-um-um-um -- right. First witness,
Nancy Larson. Housewife, mother of three.
Drives her car into the parking lot at
Pocum's...

IN _EVERETT'S MIND - EXT. POCUM'S PARKING LOT - DAY 29

NANCY LARSON pulls into the parking lot, where she sees a
dark late-model car with the hood up; it belongs to a
smallish, conservatively dressed man, DALE PORTERHOUSE,
who is about to enter the store. Nancy pulls up to the
soda machine, leaves the ENGINE RUNNING, gets out, drops
money in the slot, buys a soda, and climbs back in her
car. She begins to back out but then looks in her
rearview mirror and SCREECHES to a halt. There, in the
mirror, we see Frank Beachum, running wildly, his face
and shirt covered with blood. (The mirror reveals him
only down to his chest.)

AT EVERETT'S DESK - DAY (PRESENT) 30
Everett listening to Michelle's tape.

MICHELLE (V.O.)
-.. Larson couldn't see whether he had a
gun or not. Uhhh, no weapon was ever
found. Oh, but she later picked Beachum
out of a police line-up, and that was
the same line-up, uh, let's see, where
Beachum was picked out by Dale
Porterhouse, C.P.A...

He was passing through the neighborhood.
Car overheated, so he drove into
Pocum's to call Triple A.

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - PORTERHOUSE'S POV - DAY 32

He scans the store -- racks of food, food sale posters in
the window, and, above the front counter, a TV BLARING.
But no one, apparently, minding the store.

CLOSE ON PORTERHOUSE
The door slams behind him.
BACK TO SCENE

At the sound of the SLAMMING DOOR, Beachum pops up from
behind the counter. His face and shirt are bloody, his
eyes wild. He and Porterhouse stare at each other, and
then Beachum panics and runs for it, scampering from
behind the counter and straight out a service door on the
counter's left side. As he goes, we can see him from...

PORTERHOUSE'S POV

Beachum's whole body is IN VIEW, and there is clearly a
gun in his hand.

CLOSE ON PORTERHOUSE

Shocked and frightened, and not certain at first of what
he has seen.

PORTERHOUSE'S POV

He moves toward the counter, and as he does, we begin to
discover what is behind it -- the corpse of Amy Wilson,

her eyes open in horror, a hole in her chest, from which
blood is still oozing. Porterhouse's SCREAM FADES BACK

INTO Michelle's V.O.

MICHELLE (V.O.)
«+. Porterhouse calls the cops, picks
Beachum out of the line-up that same
day. Records later show that Amy Wilson
owed Beachum ninety-six dollars for work
he'd done on her carburetor. Note for
future essay -- why so few female car
mechanics?

AT EVERETT'S DESK - DAY (PRESENT) 33
Everett grins, shakes his head, and switches off the tape

recorder. He distractedly pulls his cigarette pack out
of his pocket. He stares at the screen. He types, and

we see the words: "BUT DIDN'T P. HEAR SHOTS?"
The Trends editor, BRIDGET ROSSITER -- busty and dressed
to show it off -- is walking by Everett's desk.

BRIDGET

Want coffee, Ev? It's back in fashion
as a late-morning pick-me-up.

EVERETT
God bless you, Bridget. Make it a big

BRIDGET

Women can fetch coffee in the office now
because improved job opportunities have
given us new confidence.

EVERETT
Bridge, darling. You think being Trends
editor is maybe getting to you?

BRIDGET
Don't know. Was I an insane person
before? You take it black, right?

EVERETT
I do. You're the best.

He looks up at the clock on the wall. It reads: 11:30.

EVERETT
(to himself)
Fuck.

He picks up the phone, taps in his number, and starts
lifting transcript pages out of the Beachum file. As we
hear the PHONE RING on the other end, he jerks a
cigarette into his mouth. He reaches for his lighter and
then suddenly looks up. At the other end of the hall,
Bob is watching him.

Everett's wife, Barbara, answers the phone.

They tried here but I wouldn't tell them
where you were.

EVERETT
I stopped off to get something on my way
back. Got caught.

A long pause. Everett plucks the unlit cigarette from
his lips and starts leafing distractedly through the
transcripts.

BARBARA (V.O.
You have a good workout, honey?

EVERETT

Mmm. Hell of a workout.

BARBARA (V.O.

Everett's attention has focused on the page in front of
him, and we see what it says:

DALE PORTERHOUSE: So I left the car there and went

Everett is completely absorbed in the page in front of
him: It reads:

CA: Did you have any idea that a crime was in progress?
DALE PORTERHOUSE: No, no idea at all.

BARBARA (V.O.

Steve? I know it's work, but I really
feel it would be a bad idea to let her
down like this again.

He pulls the lighter out of his pocket and lights his
cigarette. A long drag. Across the room, we can see
Bob's face riveted to the spectacle of Everett smoking.
Everett snaps to attention.

EVERETT
(utterly distracted)
Uh, Barbara? Uh, the thing is: There's
been an accident. Remember Michelle
Ziegler? You met her at Christmas.

BARBARA (V.O.

Oh, no. They really ought to do
something about that place. Is she
hurt?

But Everett is back to the transcript. It reads:

DALE PORTERHOUSE: I don't think I would have gone in

from across the room. He hunkers down in his seat.

BARBARA (V.O.

Steve, don't tell me they couldn't get
someone else for this. I mean, you were

Yes! Finally!

We see what he is reading:

DALE PORTERHOUSE: No. No, but I wouldn't have.

What? Where are you?

EVERETT
Honey? Hi. Listen. I don't have to be
at the prison until four. I can come
home now and pick up Kate, take her over
to the zoo, and then I'll bring her back
around three, all right?

Bridget appears with the coffee and sets it in front of
Everett.

BRIDGET
Coffee time!

He nods at her, and holds up a finger. He draws
desperately on his cigarette.

He winks at Bridget.

Why'd you have to go in there on your

Everett winces -- she's hit a nerve. He's about to say
something, and then thinks better of it.

EVERETT
Anyway. Twelve thirty, all right?

He hangs up. Bridget looks at his cigarette.

BRIDGET
Ooh. More and more office workers are

and his cigarette.

BRIDGET
Don't look now...

Everett lets out a blast of smoke, yanks open his desk
drawer, and stubs out his cigarette in a butt-filled
secret ashtray there. Meanwhile, he's reading the
transcript. Bridget peers over his shoulder.

BRIDGET
Gosh, Mr. Reporter. Is that what real
newspapermen get to read?

EVERETT

‘Dale Porterhouse: I couldn't have
heard any shots, because I had all the
windows rolled up and I had the radio
playing, and the air conditioning was

overheated." Close quote. So that
settles that, right, Bridge? Another
hunch down the drain.

Frank slowly reaches for a cigarette.

REVEREND SHILLERMAN
I understand you're a Bible-reading man,
Frank. That's right, isn't it?

Shillerman's WALKIE TALKIE, strapped to his belt, erupts
in a fit of SQUAWKING. He turns it down, but not off.
It continues to emit STATIC and DISTANT VOICES. Frank
lights his cigarette and draws deeply. Shillerman sits
down in a metal chair and slides it next to the cage,
leaning forward to encourage intimacy.

REVEREND SHILLERMAN
But you know, Frank, just reading the
Bible -- that isn't quite enough, is it?
A man can't go to his Maker with the
sins of his soul unrepented of. With

The car is brown and decrepit. One of its fenders is
rusted through, a taillight is secured by gaffer's tape,
and two hubcaps are missing. It is what is commonly
known as a shitbox.

Nevertheless, Everett is driving it as though it were a
Lamborghini. He has the window down and is banging on
the rusty door as he (very loudly) sings along to the
RADIO, which is playing "MY SHARONA." Everett makes up
most of the words, but he joins lustily on the "My

Just over a line of withering oranges and tomatoes, a
hand-lettered sign has been taped: "An Eye for an Eye!
Beachum has to Die!"

Underneath, a dripping syringe with a death's head on the
tube.

Everett raises his eyebrows. He gets out of the car.

As he does, he accidentally kicks something that has
rolled from under his seat -- an old (very old)
cantaloupe. It sploshes to the ground and shudders there
for a moment. Everett makes a sometimes-I-even-gross-
myself-out face, gingerly picks up the rotting
cantaloupe, and throws it into the vacant lot next door.
As it hits the ground and explodes, Everett makes a "bomb
exploding" noise with his mouth.

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - DAY 43

The market is a long rectangle with a counter at one end,
behind which sits a sullen, bloated woman in a bulging
white T-shirt. The grocery racks are perpendicular to
the counter, and above the counter a television is
blaring. Everett stands for a moment, wiping his
cantaloupe-tainted hand against his pants. On the TV
screen, a reporter is doing a stand-up outside the San
Quentin prison walls, talking about the somber mood
there, the tight security, and so forth.

Everett strolls toward the counter, looking around.

COUNTER WOMAN

(to Everett)
Help you?
He gives her his handsome guy smile, and, as he does, he
notices a button on her T-shirt: "Remember Amy."
EVERETT

I'm a reporter. With the Tribune. Say,
this is the place where the Wilson girl
was killed, isn't it?

COUNTER WOMAN
It sure is. She was right behind this
same counter. Almost six years ago
exactly.

Wow. Gee.

EVERETT'S POV

We take in the room with him: the racks of food, the
counter where the woman is still yapping at him --

COUNTER WOMAN (0.S.)
Mr. Pocum says the needle's too good for
him. For Beachum. Me, I say they
oughta bring back the chair, that's what
I say. Really let him have a jolt of
something.

-- the two doors (the front door and, along the same
wall, the service entrance to the left of the counter),
and the little entryway in the back.

BACK TO SCENE

EVERETT
What's back there?

COUNTER WOMAN
Bathroom. Mr. Pocum was always real
nice about letting folks come in and do
their business.

Everett nods, and for a moment he is at a loss.

EVERETT
Well, thanks a bunch. I'm gonna come
back one of these days and do some
serious shopping.

COUNTER WOMAN
Am I gonna be in the newspaper?

Everett doesn't answer. He's just spotted something on
the floor to the side of the counter, and now he crouches
down for a better look.
EVERETT'S POV
On the floor, the kind of white outlines that might have
been left in the linoleum if a foot rack had once been
placed there.
Everett gets up.

EVERETT

Hey, did there used to be something
here?

Oh, yessir, there was. That's where we
used to keep the potato chips. But Mr.
Pocum moved the rack over there --

She indicates the other side of the counter, where
customers might line up to pay.

COUNTER WOMAN
-- so's it'd be what you call an impulse
kind of purchase. This part of your
story you're writing?

Everett pauses a moment, looking around.

EVERETT
Nope. Good point. It's not part of the
story I'm writing. I'm writing a human
interest sidebar. Know what that is?

COUNTER WOMAN
I don't think I do.

EVERETT
I don't think I do, either. Hey,
thanks.

He grins and goes out the door, which slams behind him.
CUT TO:
EXT. EVERETT'S CONDO - DAY 44

Everett slams the door of his car as he gets out. The
CAR keeps COUGHING and SPUTTERING as he glances at his
watch: 12:50. He looks up at the small apartment
building where he lives. There, at the bedroom window,
is his wife BARBARA. She is young, elegant, even
beautiful, but she looks hurt and surprised, as if
someone had just slapped her across the face. She has
pushed back a white curtain and is watching Everett
approach. Their eyes meet. She does not smile. She
lets the curtain fall and disappears.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY 45
Barbara opens the door and lets Everett in.

He goes to her and kisses her. She stiffens, and his
kiss catches the right quarter of her compressed lips.
Their eyes meet.

BARBARA
In the old days, I would have smelled
the Scotch. Now I just think you don't
give a damn.

Now it's Everett who looks as though he's been slapped.

He takes a deep breath and moves toward the living room.
There, in front of the TV, sits his 4-year-old daughter,
KATE. At the sight of her dad, Kate turns away from

her umpteenth viewing of Cats Don't Dance, and her chubby
face blossoms into smiles. She climbs to her feet and
runs toward her father.

KATE
Are we, are we, are we...

EVERETT
(picking her up)
Kate! My little princess!

KATE
Are we, are we going to, we are going to
the hippotamus!

EVERETT
Don't you want to turn off the tape and
put some shoes on?

KATE
Oh, yeah.

Barbara has appeared in the b.g.

BARBARA
Shoes're in her room. I'1l get them.

She leaves. Kate reaches for the remote and punches the
stop button. On the TV screen, the animals disappear,
giving way to Dale Porterhouse, C.P.A.

PORTERHOUSE (V.O.)

(on TV)
«++. and the look on that face right
before he ran!-- I've never looked into

Everett is mesmerized. He's forgotten all about Kate,
who is sitting on her haunches, watching the TV. Now
Porterhouse disappears and a news anchor comes on.

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)

That was Dale Porterhouse, an accountant
with the firm of Smoke, no, I'm sorry,

Whitney. Mr. Porterhouse was the
state's key witness in the Amy Wilson
case six years ago, a case that at one
minute after midnight tonight will
finally culminate in the execution by
lethal injection of Frank Beachum.

Almost as if in a trance, Everett has picked up the
telephone and is pressing buttons.

KATE
No, no, Daddy. No talk on the phone.
We go the zoo now.

EVERETT
(on the phone)
We'll go to the zoo just as soon as you

Everett pushes the button and begins dialing. Barbara
enters carrying Kate's sneakers and socks. Kate runs

to her and reaches up!-- she seems upset. Meanwhile, the
TV BLARES.

BARBARA
(looking hurt)

Everett holds up a finger. The PHONE is RINGING on the
other end. On the television, Frederick Robertson, a
stolid, impressive man in a cheap suit and tie, is
talking.

ROBERTSON (V.O.)
(on TV)
Wilma, I don't think there's any such
thing as justice in a case like this.

Barbara shakes her head, goes to a cushioned chair by the
window, and hoists Kate into her lap, where she puts her
socks on, all the while glaring at Everett.

Kate leaps off her mother's lap and runs to Everett,
clutching at her father's pants leg. Everett, ever more
distracted, pats her on the head. Barbara glares. The
TV BLARES.

EVERETT
Could I leave a message? This is Steve
Everett. I'm a reporter for the Oakland
Tribune. Could you ask Mr. Porterhouse

possibly can? It's in connection with

empty Johnny Walker pint, newspapers, oil containers,
greasy rags, a mystery garment, a second Johnnie Walker

glances wistfully at the bottle and tosses it on the
floor.
BARBARA

He reaches into the seat one more time, pulls out a

ties a knot. He shakes the seat. Loose as a goose and

ice cream cone. She has Band-Aids on her forehead and

the door shut behind me, Beachum jumped
up from behind the counter.

INSIDE EVERETT'S MIND - CLOSE ON BEACHUM 65

We OVERCRANK, and Beachum rises from behind the counter,
looking bloody, looking mean. He stares at Porterhouse,
then runs out the door.

PORTERHOUSE (V.O.)
He was bloody all over, and he had a gun
in his hand. I guess he had been
bending over Amy, uh, Mrs. Wilson, and
that must have been when he took her
ring and necklace. Anyway, he got one
look at me and ran out of the service
entrance.

CLOSE ON PORTERHOUSE

Shocked and dismayed. Now he runs over to the counter.
We hear his BREATHING. He looks behind the counter.

PORTERHOUSE'S POV

Behind the counter, Amy Wilson lies dead in a pool of
blood.

65 CONTINUED: 65

PORTERHOUSE (V.O.)
My first concern was the girl, so I
immediately called 9-1-1 -- I figured
rather than chase a killer with a gun,
I'd let the police handle it.

66 INT. BREAD COMPANY RESTAURANT - DAY 66

EVERETT
And they did.

PORTERHOUSE
And they sure did. As I say, we live by
the rule of law in this country, and, uh
-- aren't you going to take notes or
record me or something? Usually when
I've talked to reporters --

EVERETT
Oh, I... have a photographic memory.

PORTERHOUSE
What? Are you kidding?

Everett pulls a notebook and a Bic out of his pocket.

EVERETT
Sorry. Not myself today. Ate a bad
oyster.

PORTERHOUSE

Yes. Well, my point was simply this...

During his next speeches, Everett pretends to be writing
in his notebook. Actually he is drawing something.

EVERETT
Can I just, do you mind if I just cut to
the chase? Didn't you ever have any
doubts? About your testimony?

PORTERHOUSE
Never. Why should I?

EVERETT
You definitely saw Frank Beachum's face.
And the gun in his hand.

PORTERHOUSE
Obviously, if I'd had any doubt, I would
have told the police.

CONTINUED: 66

EVERETT
Ooh, boy. Musta been scary. He was
pointing the gun right at you?

Everett makes a gun shape with his fingers and points it
at Porterhouse. Porterhouse is a bit taken aback.

PORTERHOUSE
No. Thank God, no.

EVERETT
Waving it high in the air?

Everett holds his hands over his head, bugs his eyes, and
pretends to wave the gun.

PORTERHOUSE
Of course not. He had it down by his
side in a very normal way.

CLOSE ON EVERETT

EVERETT
Well, how could you see it over the
potato chips?

A pause -- just a split-second.

Everett is staring into Porterhouse in a way we haven't
seen before: his eyes are like lasers. He's not trying
to spook Porterhouse, he's just looking into him, deep
into him, searching out the truth.

PORTERHOUSE
I don't understand. What potato chips?
I had a very clear view.

Everett thrusts his notebook in front of Porterhouse. On
the paper, he has sketched a rudimentary blueprint of the
store -- the counter, the two doors, and the potato-chip
rack that had left the white outlines on the floor.

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - DAY 67

The sketch segues into an OVERHEAD SHOT of the store, and
the CAMERA GLIDES DOWN TO the show what Everett is
narrating:

EVERETT (V.O.)
I mean, you came in, right? You saw
Beachum stand up behind the counter, and
you saw him run. But between you and
the service entrance, well, see, that's
where the potato-chip rack was.

CONTINUED: 67

EVERETT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And it just kind of seems to me you
couldn't have seen the gun over that
rack, if Beachum wasn't waving it in the
air or something.

Over this speech, we see Beachum running out the service
door again, but this time the potato-chip rack stands
between him and Porterhouse: Porterhouse can see Beachum
only from the chest up. Plainly, no gun is visible.

CLOSE ON EVERETT (PRESENT) 68

Still staring into Porterhouse. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to
show:

INT. BREAD COMPANY RESTAURANT - DAY

PORTERHOUSE
Why would I say I saw the gun if I
didn't?

EVERETT

You tell me. Maybe you felt good
talking to the police, the reporters --
maybe you wanted to give them a little
more than you really had. Maybe you
wanted to be the man, tell the girls
around the coffee machine --

PORTERHOUSE
(angry now)
This is absurd! You think I would
jeopardize a man's life to impress the
people in my office?

Everett looks at him, and knows that he has no real
evidence. Nothing but those white outlines on the floor
of Pocum's -- that, and what he saw for a nanosecond in
Porterhouse's eyes.

EVERETT
I don't know, Mr. Porterhouse. We only
just met.

PORTERHOUSE

Listen, wise guy. I did a little
research on you before I returned your
call. You're the guy who did the big
crusade to get that rapist released last
year, that lying what's-his-name --

EVERETT
(ruefully)
You wouldn't be referring to Mike
Vargas?
PORTERHOUSE

Yeah, you had the facts then, didn't
you? Except when you threatened him
with a D.N.A. test, he confessed. I'm
surprised you didn't get fired on the
spot, Mr. Everett.

EVERETT
Yeah. Me too.

Everett takes a deep breath and rubs his eyes. He
visibly sags: Is this another Mike Vargas case? Does he
have anything, anything at all, to go on?

EVERETT
Look, I'm sorry. I was out of line. I
thought there was -- I don't know what I
thought.

PORTERHOUSE

You're damn right you don't. And if you
go to press with some pack of lies and
innuendos, believe me!-- my lawyers will
sue you and your paper so fast you won't
know what hit you.

Everett looks down at the table. The encounter is
clearly over.

A WAITRESS approaches.
WAITRESS

specials today?

prisoners are milling around, lifting weights, smoking in
small groups. ZACHARY PLATT is Plunkitt's deputy warden.

Platt tosses a sandwich to Plunkitt. Arnold McCardle
peeks under his rye bread.

McCARDLE
Seems like there's more fat and less
meat every time I get this here.

SKYCOCK
Ain't that the way you order it, Arnold?
Hold the meat, leave the fat.

PLUNKITT
Now, Arnold's all right. More of him,
the better.

Plunkitt looks around the table, proud of his team.

PLUNKITT
Okay, what do you say we do some work
while we feed our faces? You all know
that at eighteen hundred hours, the
whole procedure staff meets here for a
final briefing. And be advised --

REVEREND SHILLERMAN
Uh, 'scuse me, warden...

PLUNKITT
Right. Right. The Reverend Shillerman
here'1ll be holding a prayer meeting at
the end of the briefing which is
optional for anyone who wants to stay.

Atkins turns away and rolls his eyes. The others
suppress guffaws. Attendance could be low.

PLUNKITT
Also, be advised, there's a change in
the sixteen hundred interview thing.
The girl had some accident or something
and they're replacing her with a guy
named Steve Everett.

ATKINS
Damn!

PLUNKITT
Now I realize his butt ain't quite up to
the standard of Michelle's, but that's
who's coming. Everybody clear on that?

AT EVERETT'S DESK - DAY

Everett sits for a moment, lost in thought. He is
staring at a photo of Beachum and a photo of Porterhouse,
and he is wrestling with his doubts. Finally he smacks
his fist on the desk, gets up, and starts walking toward
Alan's office.

INT. NEWS ROOM - DAY

Bob is staring malevolently as Everett strides toward
Alan Mann's office. As Everett passes Jane, she looks up
at him and then back down, shaking her head.

Inside Alan's office we can see the editor talking with a
very distinguished-looking, gray-haired man in an
expensive suit. This is HENRY LOWENSTEIN, the
newspaper's owner.

Everett knocks on Alan's glass wall, and Alan motions him
in.

INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Everett enters. Alan and Lowenstein rise.

LOWENSTEIN
Well, speak of the devil. Alan here
tells me I'm paying you too much.

EVERETT
Yeah, but you can rest assured that I'm
frittering it away on booze and girls.

LOWENSTEIN
(laughing)
Hah! You're a dyed-in-the-wool
sonuvabitch, Everett, anyone ever tell
you that?

EVERETT
Only my friends and loved ones. Hey, I
didn't mean to interrupt. I can come
back --

LOWENSTEIN
I was just leaving. Seriously -- still
sober as a judge, right?

EVERETT
You obviously haven't partied with the
sixth circuit court lately.

But this time Lowenstein really is serious -- he wants an
answer.

EVERETT
Yes, Mr. Lowenstein. Still sober as --

LOWENSTEIN
Good to see you, Steve. Alan.

He nods toward them both and leaves.

Alan sits down and motions for Everett to do the same.
Alan pulls a Snickers out of his drawer.

ALAN
Stop fucking Bob's wife. He doesn't
like it.

EVERETT
What, did he put it in the company
newsletter?

Alan points his Snickers at Everett.

ALAN
If he comes to me and wants your ass,
I'm gonna have to give it to him. Then
you'll just be a hole with no ass around
it.

Everett pulls out a cigarette and lights it, hiding
momentarily behind the flame. Alan bites his Snickers,
gazing at Everett.

ALAN
You know what, Ev? You're a fucking
womanizer, that's what. You're fucking
up your whole career and you're fucking
up your marriage and if you can't keep
your goddamned prick in your pants I'm
not gonna be able to goddamned protect
you. How was she?

EVERETT
None of your goddamned business. Not
bad.

ALAN

Lucky bastard. I always liked her. I
ever tell you about the assistant D.A. I
fell for in New York?

EVERETT
No, and if you tell me now, I'm going to
throw myself across your desk and rip
your throat out with my bare hands.

ALAN
Oh, the nickel finally drops. Christ,
boy, don't you know Bob's been after you
since you got here? In that quiet,
earnest, reasonable way of his. He's
probably glad you fucked Patricia so he
has ethical reason to annihilate you.

EVERETT
Great. I live to make him happy. But
that's not my problem.

ALAN
You should've fucked my wife. I'd've
just punched you.

EVERETT
I did fuck your wife.

ALAN

EVERETT
Real wildcat. But that's not my

REVEREND SHILLERMAN
I, uh, I myself had a personal heart-to-
heart with the prisoner myself this
morning, and, going by my experience
with the men, he won't be any trouble,
in my opinion.

Plunkitt fantasizes the hard point of his shoe making
contact with Shillerman's ass.

Just then, a shadow falls across the table. The men look
up and go silent.

Standing quietly above them is the executioner. He nods
to the men. They nod back somberly, and we see their
faces, one by one.

Hey.

Alan chews mightily. Across from him, Everett smokes.
They look at each other, two old friends enjoying a mock
standoff.

ALAN
All right, all right. What have you got
on Beachum?

Everett lifts his cigarette hand as if to speak -- but
what, indeed, has he got? He puts the filter to his lips
and sucks hard. Alan watches him, shaking his head in
mock horror.

ALAN
Oh... oh, Ev.

EVERETT
No, no, wait...

ALAN
Ev, CV, GV...

EVERETT

Just listen to me a moment...

ALAN
Ev. I don't have to listen to you. I'm
looking at you. I'm looking and I see a
reporter who's about to tell me that he
has a hunch.

EVERETT
Alan, I've done some checking up...

ALAN
Do you know my opinion of reporters who
have hunches?

EVERETT
I talked to one of the witnesses, Alan.
He says he saw a gun, but I know he

didn't.

ALAN
I can't fart loud enough to express my
opinion.

EVERETT

Alan, even Michelle knew this thing
stinks. There are discrepancies.

Alan brings his chair forward sharply. His eyes bug.

(CONTINUED)
71.
74 CONTINUED: (2) 74

ALAN
Discrepancies? Did I hear you say there
were discrepancies? After a police
investigation? A trial? Six years of
appeals? You found discrepancies? What
did it take you, half an hour?

EVERETT
Come on. You know the appeals system.
Beachum's first lawyer was probably some
twelve-year-old Legal Aid guy, and if he
didn't object to something at the trial,
then the appeals guys had nothing to
work with, no matter how sharp they
were, which of course they weren't.

ALAN
Ev...

EVERETT
Alan, for Christ's sake, they're gonna
kill this guy.

Everett crushes out his cigarette and stares at Alan.
Alan stares back. Finally, he sighs and grins ruefully.

ALAN
All right, all right. You're saying you
can turn this routine execution piece
into some kind of big fight-for-justice
story. And that'll give me an excuse to
stand up for you when Bob asks me to
transfer you to the toilet.

EVERETT
I need this one, Alan.

ALAN
You'll still lose the wife and kid, you
know. She's gonna find out.

EVERETT
Don't say that. Don't even -- I gotta
fix that. I'm gonna --

ALAN
I don't have to tell you what'll happen
if you pull another Mike Vargas on me,
right? You come up with something,
okay, I'll run it, but it'd better be
good.

EVERETT
Look, I was drinking back then, all
right? You drink, you lose your story
nose. My nose is back. I'm sure of it.

ALAN
I guess we'll both find out.

EVERETT
There's just one thing. What if I
really find something, you know? We
can't just wait for it to run tomorrow.

ALAN
Ev, I know what you're thinking. I can
hear your little brain ticking -- I

really can. And let me just remind you:
if you go to Lowenstein thinking he'll
call the governor --

EVERETT
The gov'll listen to Lowenstein.

ALAN
-- it better be awfully good. Or he not
only won't call the governor, he'll eat
your heart and throw your body to the
dogs. You won't have to sleep with his
wife, pal. He'll fire you for free.

EVERETT
Okay, Alan. Honest to God, I'm gonna...
Anyway, thanks

ALAN
Hey, don't thank me. I don't know whose
ass you're trying to save here,
Beachum's or your own. But if your nose
for a story's gone, you're gone, too.
I'm not running this paper to salvage
what's left of your smarmy little
existence. So she was really pretty
good, huh?

EVERETT
Fuck you.

Alan starts whistling to himself. Everett leaves the

INT. CITY ROOM - DAY 75

Everett makes a beeline for the supply room. In the
b.g., we can see Bob watching him, giving him the evil
eye. Everett looks at the clock.

ANGLE ON CLOCK
It reads 2:50.
INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY 76

Everett enters and begins scouting for pads. He grabs
two from a pile and shoves them into his back pocket. He
takes a couple of Bics and clips them to the pocket of
his shirt. He turns.

Bob Findley is standing in front of him, smiling a
mirthless, pitying smile. Everett watches him in horror.

BOB
You know, I don't know what to say to
you. All day, I've been trying to think
of what to say to you.

EVERETT
I really am sorry, Bob. Really. I am.

BOB
(a bitter laugh)
You know, I really don't think you are.
I actually don't think you're capable of
feeling sorry. I don't think you're
capable of feeling anything for others.

This hits Everett unexpectedly hard.

EVERETT
You might be right, Bob... I... you
might be right.
(beat)
How'd you find out, anyway?

BOB
She told me.

EVERETT
She...?

able to talk to me. All right?
Remember, we talked about the baby
Jesus? Well, I'll be up with Him. I'll

He stifles a sob.

BEACHUM

Look. I wrote you a letter...

He reaches for it, but Gail's face shows she doesn't
understand.

BEACHUM
Your mama will have it for when you need
it, later on. So you go on now. I love
you, baby. I'1l always love you.

Beachum gently delivers Gail to the female guard. He's
trying desperately not to choke up as Gail follows the
guard meekly for a few steps before turning back --

GAIL
Why can't you just come home? You
should just kill all these people and
come home!

The guard starts to pull her away. Beachum puts an arm
over his face -- this is more than he can bear. Bonnie
holds her face in her hands, sobbing. The door closes,
but we can still hear her shrill little voice.

The same photo of Amy Wilson that we have seen on TV --
the drab blouse, the gold locket, the mousy brown hair.

The CAR pulls in, COUGHING blue smoke. It shudders for a
moment after Everett TURNS OFF the ENGINE. He gets out.

A very old steak, still in its supermarket packaging,
thuds to the ground as he steps out. He looks at it
curiously for a moment -- When did he intend to cook it?
How drunk was he? -- and then he picks it up. It seems
to be oozing. Gingerly, Everett tosses it in the back
seat. He heads for the prison.

Then he looks up at Everett, who is looking down at him.

REEDY
You've got fifteen minutes, Mr. Everett.
By order of Warden Plunkitt. Keep it
to fifteen minutes.

EVERETT'S POV

Beachum moves toward the bars. His face is marked by a
profound weariness. He looks drained, hollowed out,
almost spectral. Now Bonnie rises up behind him and
moves toward the bars too, her hand clutching Beachum's,
the knuckles white.

BACK TO SCENE
Reedy pulls up a chair in front of the cell for Everett.

Beachum sticks his hand through the cell, and Everett
shakes it.

BEACHUM
Mr. Everett, I'm Frank Beachum. Have
a...

He gestures toward the chair.

EVERETT
Yeah. Thanks.

Everett sits and pulls out his notebook and pen. Beachum
gently disengages himself from Bonnie and lowers himself
into the chair at the table in front of Everett. Bonnie
sinks back down onto the cot, her eyes on Everett.
Everett fiddles for a cigarette, jerks one halfway out of
the pack, and offers it to Beachum.

BEACHUM
I got ‘em.

They light up, and then they smoke for a long, awkward
moment.

BEACHUM
How's... that girl? That other, that
Michelle. She had some accident?
EVERETT
Yeah. Car crash. She's... she didn't

make it.

Another awkward silence. They smoke.

BEACHUM
Well... I guess you want to talk to me
about how it feels. In here.

EVERETT
Yeah, that's it. It's a human interest

story.

Everett watches the long, sad, tired face pushing the
words out at him through the bars, through the smoke.

BEACHUM
(his voice flat)
I been thinking about that. Hey, look
what my daughter drew me. My daughter
Gail. Calls it 'Green Pastures.'

Beachum shows him the drawing. Everett tries to look
interested.

BEACHUM
Well, only thing I want to say, I wanted
to tell everyone that I believe in Jesus
Christ. Our Lord and Savior.

Everett scribbles dutifully on his pad: "B'lieve in JC,
Lord + Sav..."

BEACHUM
And I believe... I'm going to a better
place and there's a better justice
there, you know, and... I won't say I'm
not afraid ‘cause I think...

A loud sob from Bonnie, who is sitting on the cot.

BEACHUM

.-». ‘cause I think everyone's afraid of
dying pretty much. I came to my faith
late in life, you know. I done some bad
things when I was younger, but that was
then, you know. Anyway, I know the
crooked will be made straight -- that's
what the Bible says, and I believe that.

Everett scribbles: "crooked made straight."

He looks at Everett, but for some reason Everett can't
manage to look back. Everett just keeps staring down at
his pad.

BEACHUM
Is that all right, Mr. Everett?

Everett can't look at him. He glances over at Reedy.

REEDY
You got nine more minutes.

BEACHUM
Is that what you wanted or...

Everett finally looks up, blowing a stream of smoke in an
unsteady breath. He leans forward, forcing himself to
look at this condemned, roiling man living out his last
hours -- the pain in that face, and the toil. Bonnie
looks up, watching Everett.

EVERETT
Mr. Beachum... You don't know me, Mr.
Beachum, but I'1l tell you, I probably
got a screw loose somewhere. To tell
you the truth, I don't give a rat's ass
about Jesus Christ. And I don't care
about justice, in this life or the next.
To be honest, I don't even care about
what's right and wrong. Never have.

Everett drops his cigarette to the floor and rubs it out
with his shoe. Beachum and Bonnie are watching him,
mesmerized.

Everett taps his nose.

EVERETT
You know what this is?

BEACHUM
Is this some kind of joke?

EVERETT
It's no joke, Mr. Beachum. It's my
nose. And my nose -- well, to tell you
the pitiful truth, it's my whole goddamn
life. When my nose says something
stinks, I gotta have faith in it, just
like you have your faith in Jesus.

EVERETT (CONT'D)

When it's working, I know there's truth
out there somewhere. But if it leads me
astray, well, I may as well drive off a
cliff... I really -- I'm nothing. The
point is, lately I'm not a hundred
percent positive my nose is working
right. So I have to know. Did you kill
that woman or not?

BEACHUM

(dully,
disbelieving)

What?

What happened,

EVERETT
dammit? In that store.

The day Amy Wilson was shot.

The two men stare at each other. We see that Everett is
looking right into Beachum, the way he looked right into

Porterhouse.

BEACHUM

I... went in to buy a bottle of A-1

Sauce.

EVERETT

And you paid Amy for it at the counter.

BEACHUM

Well, no, I never got it. Look, I told
them all this --

CLOSE ON EVERETT

Tell it again.

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY -

Beachum enters through

the main door. To his left,
Amy.

BEACHUM

Hey, Amy. Where you keep the steak

sauce?

AMY

Hi, Frank. It's back, you see where the
ketchup and relish is?

Yeah.

BEACHUM

(CONTINUED)
81.
85 CONTINUED: 85

He starts to go, but when Amy calls to him he approaches
the counter.

AMY
Frank, you know I been meaning to talk
to you.

BEACHUM

Yeah. I bet I know what about.

AMY
I don't got it, Frank. I could pay you
thirty now. But I don't got the whole

thing.
BEACHUM
When could you do the whole ninety-six?
AMY
After I get paid, fifteenth of July.
BEACHUM
You're not always gonna do me this way,
are you?
AMY

I swear it, Frank. We just had some
extra expenses, end of the school year
and all.

BEACHUM
It's cool. July fifteenth. Hey, I'm
just gonna use the bathroom, okay?

AMY
You know where, right?

Beachum nods and heads toward the back of the store. The
bathroom is in a small entryway, and as Beachum heads
toward it, we hear the front DOOR SLAM. Beachum
struggles for a moment with the sticky bathroom door and
goes in.

86 INT. DEATHWATCH CELL - DAY 86

EVERETT
So you weren't even mad about the money?

BEACHUM
Well, I wanted her to understand I
didn't like doing business that way.
But she was cool. I liked her.

EVERETT
Were you carrying a gun?
BEACHUM
No way, man.
EVERETT
So then what?
INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - BATHROOM - DAY 87

Beachum is standing in the stall (it's a one-toilet
bathroom), humming to himself. We hear MUFFLED VOICES
outside, and at first Beachum doesn't notice them. He
finishes and FLUSHES the TOILET. Over the sound of the
flush, the VOICES GROW LOUDER. Beachum can't be sure
what he's hearing. Then he hears Amy's anguished
voice!--

AMY (0.S.)
Please! Not that!

-- followed by a GUNSHOT. For a moment, Beachum stands
paralyzed. Then he bolts out of the stall, pushes at the
sticky bathroom door, kicks it open, runs down the small
entryway, and emerges into the main body of the store.

INT. POCUM'S GROCERY - BEACHUM'S POV - DAY 88

The door to the service entrance is slamming. There's no
one else in sight. Beachum runs toward the counter;
behind it, Amy Wilson is lying on her back, her eyes
wide, her chest torn open by a bullet, the last breaths
rattling out of her.

Outside, very distantly, the sound of a CAR DOOR being
SLAMMED, and then the SCREECH of TIRES.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Beachum falls to his knees by Amy's side, trying
everything he can think of, making up his own brand of
CPR as he goes along -- thumping her chest, breathing
into her mouth, trying to staunch the blood with his
hands, calling her name. Blood soaks his shirt,
splatters onto his face, runs down his fingers. Amy
looks into his eyes, terrified, and then her eyes go
blank.

Dimly, he hears the FRONT DOOR CLOSE. And a voice:

PORTERHOUSE (0.S.)
Hey! Anybody here?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 88

Beachum pops up from behind the counter. Porterhouse's
jaw drops.

PORTERHOUSE
Hey! What's going on? Oh my God!

For a moment, he and Beachum stare at each other, and
then, for another split second, Beachum looks down at
himself, realizes how all this must seem, and bolts for
the service door. We see clearly that the potato chip
rack stands between him and Porterhouse.

EXT. POCUM'S GROCERY - BEACHUM'S POV - DAY 89

He is RUNNING OUT the service door INTO a small
passageway full of garbage cans, fire extinguishers,
boxes and crates. OUT the outer screen door, RUNNING --
and wham! Nancy Larson's car nearly backs into him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Beachum looks up, and we see Larson's eyes looking back,
startled, from her rear-view mirror. Then Beachum runs
out of the parking lot.

INT. DEATHWATCH CELL - DAY 90

EVERETT
"Please, not that.'

BEACHUM
‘swhat I heard.

Everett pops a cigarette into his mouth, never taking his
gaze off Beachum's face.

EVERETT
Why'd you run?

BEACHUM
I shouldn't have. But you know, I'ma
two-time loser, Mr. Everett. And there
I was with all that blood and a dead
girl right next to me and a white man
staring at me like I was -- I just
panicked.

EVERETT
So who shot her, Frank?

Bonnie gasps. She is staring at Everett.

(CONTINUED)
84.

90 CONTINUED: 90

BEACHUM

I don't know.
EVERETT

Did Porterhouse see the gun?
REEDY

(threateningly)

You got five minutes, over there.
BEACHUM

I told you. Wasn't no gun.
EVERETT

Did he see the shooter?
BEACHUM

I don't know. How should I know?
EVERETT

Of course he didn't. ‘Cause by the time

he pulled into the parking lot, the
shooter was gone. That's why he didn't
hear the shots, either.

REEDY
Mr. Everett...

BEACHUM
I don't know. I don't know when
anything happened.

EVERETT
‘Cause you don't know how long you were
down on the floor trying to save Amy's
life.

Bonnie sobs, but Everett ignores her. Beachum begins to

slump and look away, but Everett only grows more intent.

In the b.g., Reedy picks up the phone and talks anxiously
into it. He never takes his eyes off Everett.

EVERETT
So what was it, Frank, a simple robbery?
Who else could have been there? Come
on, Frank. Someone have something
against her?

BEACHUM
I just don't know. I didn't see.

EVERETT
(bearing down
on him)
Come on, give me something.

I don't know what you want.

Reedy squeaks his chair and stands up.

REEDY
All right, that's it.

Bonnie flings herself off the bed and rushes toward the
bars.

BONNIE
No!

Everett looks at her desperate, tear-stained face, but
already Reedy is grabbing him, moving him forcefully
away.

BONNIE
You believe us. Don't you? Do you
believe us?

EVERETT
(to Reedy)
All right, all right.

REEDY
Let's go. Upsetting people...

BONNIE
Do. You. Believe. Us?

BEACHUM
Don't, Bonnie. Don't.

REEDY
Come on, dammit.

For a moment, everything stops. Everett stares at Bonnie
and Bonnie stares back.

EVERETT
Yes. I believe you. For Christ's sake.

Bonnie closes her eyes and begins weeping against the
bars. Reedy pulls Everett toward the door.

EVERETT

All right, dammit.
REEDY

Coming in here, upsetting people.

Where's your goddamn heart, man? Don't
you think these people have enough?
What do you think this is?

EVERETT
All right. Sorry. Yeah.

They are at the door, but now Everett looks back. Bonnie
is staring at him the way you'd look at a child who had
just done something thoughtless and cruel.

BONNIE
Where were you? Dear God, where were
you all this time?

 

Reedy starts to move Everett out, but Everett resists.

EVERETT
It wasn't my story. There was an
accident -- It wasn't supposed to be my

story.
Reedy pushes Everett out into the hall.
91 INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY 91
As Reedy pushes Everett into the corridor, Plunkitt is

waiting for him. He looks quizzically at Everett and
holds out his hand.

PLUNKITT
(shaking hands)
Everett.
EVERETT
Warden. Good to see you again.
PLUNKITT
(gently)

I'll walk you to your car.
They walk.

PLUNKITT
Terrible about Ms. Ziegler.

EVERETT
Yeah. Horrible thing.

PLUNKITT
You know, she gave me to understand that
she wanted to talk to Beachum about, you
know, his emotions before the execution.

PLUNKITT (CONT'D)
Human interest stuff. ‘Cause otherwise,
we do most press interviews by phone at
this point. Less risk of upsetting the
prisoner.

EVERETT
Yeah. I probably should have prepared
better. Kind of a last-minute thing.
92 EXT. PRISON PARKING LOT - DAY 92

Plunkitt accompanies Everett toward his (Everett's) car.

PLUNKITT
You know, people come in here, the
press. Prisoners tell ‘em things!-- all

kind of heart-wrenching things. And
then the next day, in the paper, we're
the ones who come off sounding like hard
guys. It can get pretty frustrating, is
all.

EVERETT
Sure. Of course.

PLUNKITT
We have to do what the state tells us to
do. Makes it a little tough on us here
if we show up in the newspaper as bloody
murderers or anything like that.

EVERETT
Right. I understand completely.

PLUNKITT

Knew you would.

(beat)
You know, these things go through all
kind of trials and appeals before they
get to us. It's no use trying to figure
out who's naughty and who's nice and
then come sliding down the chimney like

a hero -- not on execution day. You're
not Santa Claus. No such thing as Santa
Claus.

They reach the car. Plunkitt seems as though he wants to
say something else, but instead he just stands there.

PLUNKITT
Well...

Everett looks at him expectantly, but Plunkitt can't find
the words. Suddenly, Everett's expression changes.

EVERETT
You're not sure, are you, Luther?

Plunkitt looks at Everett for a long moment, then slaps
his shoulder.

PLUNKITT
You drive safe now.

Plunkitt turns and walks back toward the prison doors.
EXT. DOWNTOWN COURTHOUSE - DAY 93

CECILIA NUSSBAUM, circuit attorney, comes out the formal
door and starts down a series of long stone steps. She's
a small, ugly woman with a big, fleshy beezer sticking
out of a face that resembles a collection of frowns all
glued on top of one another. She's accompanied by WALLY
CARTWRIGHT, an imposing black attorney in a concrete-gray
suit. Everett bounds up to them.

EVERETT
Cecilia!

Nussbaum and Cartwright look but never break stride.

EVERETT
Wait. This is urgent.

NUSSBAUM
Not a good time, Everett.

EVERETT
I know you're busy, but --

Cartwright crosses laterally like a good linebacker.
Everett is shoved off-course. He staggers a step to the
side.

NUSSBAUM
Not now. Call my office.

EVERETT
Cecilia, I'm telling you --

He reaches out to slow her. Cartwright pokes him in the
chest.

CARTWRIGHT
Look...

Everett knocks the finger away.
(CONTINUED )
89.
93 CONTINUED: 93

EVERETT
Oh, bullshit. You're a fucking circuit
attorney, I'm a reporter. You wanna hit
me or you wanna keep your job?

NUSSBAUM
Why don't you get in the car, Wally?
EVERETT
Yeah, why don't you get in the car,
Wally.
Cartwright wavers a moment, and then moves toward the
car.
CARTWRIGHT
(murmuring)

New York asshole.

NUSSBAUM
What is it, Everett?

EVERETT
(still fuming)
All right. Frank Beachum. Who else was
there?

NUSSBAUM
Are you back on the bottle?

EVERETT
When Amy Wilson was killed, who else was
there? Porterhouse, Nancy Larson,
Beachum. And who else?

Once again, Everett's eyes have become a laser beam. He
is watching Cecilia's eyes the way he watched
Porterhouse's eyes and Frank Beachum's eyes. Cecilia's
eyes are very still.

NUSSBAUM
What difference does it make?

Everett's face: He knows he's right.

EVERETT
He's the shooter, Cecilia. Whoever he
was, he shot Amy. Who was he? Come on.

NUSSBAUM
Everett, I don't know what kind of
cockamamie conspiracy theory you're
working on, but this is a solid case. I
don't send innocent men to the Death
House.
(CONTINUED )

CONTINUED: (2) 93

EVERETT
I know that, I do. But this time you
made a mistake.

Sitting in the Cadillac, Cartwright HONKS the HORN.
Without even looking up, Nussbaum holds up her index
finger.

EVERETT
Beachum was in the bathroom when Amy got
shot. He only went to Pocum's to buy a
bottle of steak sauce.

NUSSBAUM
You've always been a gullible
sonuvabitch, Everett. Read the
transcripts. A witness saw Beachum with
the gun.

EVERETT
He didn't see the gun. There were
potato chips in the way.

NUSSBAUM
You're telling me he said that.
EVERETT
No. But I could see it in his face. I

could tell.

Nussbaum's face changes to a mask of leathery disdain.

NUSSBAUM
You haven't got jackshit.
EVERETT
He didn't do it! How much jackshit do I

need?

Nussbaum studies him for a second and then begins heading
down the stairs toward her car. Everett follows.

EVERETT
There was someone else, wasn't there?

NUSSBAUM
(without looking
back)
A kid. Bought a Coke from the machine.
He didn't even look inside.

EVERETT
He shot Amy Wilson.

(CONTINUED)
91.
93 CONTINUED: (3) 93

NUSSBAUM
We interviewed him. We issued a
description of his car and he came in of
his own free will. His story checked
out. He didn't see a thing.

EVERETT
He shot her! You didn't get him to say
anything because you had already
arrested Beachum -- you thought you had
the guy. But the kid was the guy!

Nussbaum reaches the car. Everett thrusts himself
between her and the door.

EVERETT
Tell me his name.

NUSSBAUM
He was nothing to the case. We put him
in the same lineup Beachum was in. Both
our witnesses looked right at him and
still fingered Beachum as the killer.

She looks at Everett triumphantly -- and indeed, for a
moment, Everett is shaken. But he quickly recovers.

EVERETT
Okay, but what do you expect? Your
witnesses didn't even get there till the
shooter was long gone. Look, just give
me the kid's name. Let me talk to him.

NUSSBAUM
How'm I supposed to remember his name
after six years? He was nothing to the

case.

EVERETT
It's in your files, your notes.
Somewhere.

NUSSBAUM

(opening the car door)
Call me tomorrow. I'1l see if I can
find it.
She begins to get into the car, but Everett grabs the
door, drawing it back -- and her with it. Everett is
burning with rage.

EVERETT
If you let it wait till tomorrow, then
you better sleep goddamn well tonight.
‘Cause after today, I'm gonna haunt you,
lady. I'm gonna hound the living shit
out of you.

Nussbaum lets the door go and turns to face Everett. She
is not large, but she looks utterly terrifying.

NUSSBAUM
(too quietly)
I'm not Wally, Steve. I'ma lot bigger
than Wally. And if you threaten me
again, there'll be little pieces of your
life all over the gutter. ‘Cause I'll
blow the rest away.

Everett stares at her. She shuts the door with a heavy
thud. Wally is about to drive away when Nussbaum opens
the car window.

NUSSBAUM
One more thing, barfly. Just thought
you oughta know before your latest lost
cause confesses. Anyone ever tell you
that Beachum volunteered for a lie
detector test? Yeah. He flunked, big
time. Sure, it's inadmissible -- that's
why you didn't read about it in the
transcripts. Still, it kind of captured
our interest. Why don't you go pour
yourself a tall one and think it over?

Everett stares at her. The car speeds off.

For a moment, Everett crumbles. He sits down on the
steps of the courthouse and puts his head in his hands.

INT. CITY ROOM - DAY 94

As Everett walks in, he sees Bob Findley smiling at
him!-- a tight, terrible little smile that says: I have
you by the balls. Everett goes to his desk, turns on his
computer, and unwraps a ham sandwich. He lets out a long
sigh.

At the desk next to him, TOM DONALDSON, a plump reporter
in his forties, rolls his chair over. He holds a glass
of Scotch.

DONALDSON
Hey, Ev.

(CONTINUED)
94

93.

CONTINUED: 94

Everett nods. For a moment he looks longingly at the

Scotch.

Donaldson notices.

DONALDSON
Hey, you want a nip?

Everett's eyes say yes, but then he shakes his head.

EVERETT
No. Thanks, Tom, I don't think I
better.

DONALDSON

Sorry, Ev. I forgot. Hey, what's with
you and Bob? He's been giving you the
evil eye all day.

EVERETT
Yeah, and you know what? It's working.

DONALDSON
No, really -- did something happen at
the prison? Some big uproar?

EVERETT
Tell me something, Tom. Why would a
guilty man volunteer for a lie detector
test?

DONALDSON
Happens all the time. Perp gets cocky,
thinks he can slide one by. Course,
innocent men flunk 'em sometimes, too.
Why? Bob want you to take one?

EVERETT
There's a cute idea. No, I don't think
my guilt's in any doubt. Hey, is
Bridget still here? I was going to try
and get her to do some scutwork for me.
Women are feeling more secure these
days, you know.

DONALDSON
She went home. But I'll get you a cup
of coffee if you'll give me head.

EVERETT
Cool. Could you see if you can track
down any of the detectives who worked
the Beachum case? See if anyone ever
heard of another witness at the murder
scene -- a kid. I just need a name and
address.

DONALDSON
You got it.
BACK TO SCENE
EVERETT
And, Tom. Could you get me a cup of

coffee?

Donaldson blows him a kiss and walks away. Everett picks
up the phone and punches in some numbers. He gives Alan
a friendly wave. Alan glances at Bob, who returns the
glance. Alan goes back in his office. Bob sits back
down at his desk.

VOICE (V.O.)

All of us. Anyone here.

EVERETT
Okay. Before Beachum goes in the store,
a kid drives into the parking lot.
Right?

VOICE
Wrong. Anyway, there's nothing like
that in the files.

EVERETT
How do you know? Aren't you gonna
check?
VOICE
(laughing)

Believe me, Mr. Everett, we all know.

I'm not happy. Why would you say that?

Alan sits down and rubs his forehead.

ALAN
I understand your interview at the
prison went somewhat beyond the
requirements of a human interest
sidebar.

Everett grabs his cigarettes and shoots one into his
mouth.

EVERETT
Okay. I colored outside the lines a
little. I don't think Plunkitt's sore.

Everett lights the cigarette and draws hard on it.

BOB
No, Steve. He just figured you were
back on the booze. And by the way,
there's no smoking in this building.

ALAN
Boys, boys. Come on. I can't have
this. Everett, say you're sorry. Bob,
punch his lights out.

BOB
(looking surprised)
This isn't a personal matter, Alan.
This was an important story. I gave
Steve very specific instructions on
this. The paper made promises to

Plunkitt...
EVERETT
The guy's innocent!
BOB
(rolling his eyes)
Oh.
EVERETT

He is! Bob, it's not a human interest
sidebar. It's a cruci-fucking-fiction,

juiced. You can use that in the
sidebar.

BOB
(more in sorrow than
anger )
That's not the point.

EVERETT
You bet it's not the point.

ALAN
Well, look. We'll take Everett off the
execution and put Harvey on it instead.

BOB
Fine. But that's still not the point.
ALAN
Yeah, well, we all know what the point
is.
BOB

(very deliberately)
The only point is that I can't work with
you anymore, Steve. Maybe you're a good
reporter. Everyone says so. But there
are other good reporters and they don't
have your attitude and they follow
instructions. I can't work with you.

Alan lets out a low moan. Everett smokes, studying the
floor. Bob gazes at him righteously. Then Everett
explodes.

EVERETT
Why don't you just hit me, Bob? I
deserve it. I'll fall down. I'll
bleed. You'll love it. It'll be great.
Punch me out, man.

Then you can go home and hit your wife,
too. She likes it.

 

Bob's head goes back a little, but he retains his icy
calm.

BOB
I guess we can't all live in the world
of your imagination, Steve. I'm not
going to hit anybody, no matter what
they want. If Patricia needs some other
kind of relationship, she'll have to go
find that. But my marriage is none of
your business. What matters is that
you're a thoughtless, mentally
unbalanced man, and I can't work with
you anymore.

Alan moans again, covering his eyes with his hand.
Suddenly, Everett realizes that he's losing his job. He
turns to Alan.

EVERETT
Alan, listen. I've got the shooter.

ALAN
(lowering his hand)
You what?

BOB
I don't think we should confuse two
separate issues.

EVERETT
I got the guy who shot Amy Wilson.
BOB
Look, even if he knows who shot
Kennedy! --
ALAN
Shut up, Bob. How have you got him?
EVERETT
I know who he is.
ALAN
All right. Who is he?
EVERETT
He's... he's a guy. A guy who was

there.
Alan pinches the bridge of his nose and closes his eyes.

You're telling me the shooter was a guy
who was there? Good work, Steve.
Should I hold the front page or do you
wanna get two unnamed sources on it?

BOB
This is ridiculous.
ALAN

Don't remember. Or they're sitting on

BOB
Have you tried the Yellow Pages? Under

Everett angrily stubs out his cigarette and turns toward
the window. Bob moves toward the desk, a mournful look
on his face.

BOB
Alan, I'm sorry. I really am. I know
this is causing problems for everybody,
but I want to be clear about this. I'm
ready to leave. I love this paper, but
I'm not going to spend my life in an
environment that has become intolerable.

Everett watches the traffic. The buses are still
rolling. People still go about their business.

Inspiration hits. His eyes light up. He whirls around.

Then the line will be flushed with
twenty CCs of saline solution, and then
he will be given fifty CCs of
pancuronium bromide. Now that is a
muscle paralyzer, and his muscles will
be paralyzed at that point -- he won't
be able to breathe. And finally, fifty
CCs of potassium chloride, and that'll

stop his heart.

We talked with Prison

Doctor Roger Waters earlier today.

DR. WATERS (V.0.)

(on the radio)

It should be a very pleasant, a very
rapid sleep, and then the prisoner will
know nothing else after that.

INT. DEATH CHAMBER - EVENING 99

Over the preceding:

Skycock testing the syringes.

We see each syringe as the radio reporter mentions it.

The CAMERA CONTINUES TO ROAM THROUGH the prison as we

OTHER PRISONERS IN OPEN AREA 101

Thanks,

RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
And, as we told you

earlier this afternoon, the governor met
with the murder victim's father and
mother, who urged him not to grant
Beachum a pardon. Governor's aide Harry
Mancuso spoke to us after that meeting.

MANCUSO (V.O.)

This administration is determined to
remain as tough on crime as it has
always been, and we are determined to
see justice done for the family of Amy
Wilson and the people of this state.

EVERETT'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD OF CAR 102

We see a large warehouse-like structure -- the loft
building where Michelle Ziegler lived.

CLOSE ON RINGING PHONE 104

It's in the kitchen of Everett's condo. Barbara, his
wife, goes to answer it.

BARBARA
Hello... Yes, this is... yes, Steve's
wife. Why? Has something happened to
him?
CLOSE ON EVERETT'S FACE 105

Wreathed in eerie light. Suddenly the light goes out.

EVERETT
(in a hoarse
whisper)
Shit!

EXT. MICHELLE'S LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

We PULL BACK to see that Everett is trying to pick the
lock of the outside door with a credit card. He has just
dropped his flashlight; he picks it up again, and it
shines for a moment on Michelle Ziegler's name on the
buzzer. Everett monkeys with the credit card until he
hears a CLICK.

Only it isn't really a click. It's the SNAP of his
CREDIT CARD breaking in half. He withdraws it and
watches the other piece fall to the ground. His
flashlight jiggles on it for a moment.

EVERETT
Shit!

He looks guiltily over his shoulder. The streets are
deserted. Stealthily, he reaches down and picks up an
object out of the darkness. A tire iron.

He rises. The wooden door has a windowed top. Everett
taps against it gently, stealthily.

The whole PANE SHATTERS with a resounding CRASH. Everett
looks around again, reaches in, and turns the inside

knob.

INT. MICHELLE'S BUILDING - NIGHT 106

He enters and hurries through the entryway. GLASS
CRUNCHES under his feet.

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT 107

Everett goes up the steps two at a time, panting. We can
hear his BREATH sawing in and out of him. Three flights.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 108
Everett reaches the top and runs down the hall. When he

gets to Michelle's door he collapses against the wall,
gasping.

Finally, he wills himself away from the wall, staring at

the column of stalwart locks on Michelle's door.

Somewhat daunted, he nevertheless fits the wedge of the

tire iron into the jamb.

The door swings slowly open. Surprised, Everett stumbles
in.

INT. MICHELLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 109

Everett's flashlight sweeps the loft space, revealing
boxes, tapes, and stacks of paper everywhere.

Everett kneels down to examine the contents of one box.

Suddenly, a hand lashes forward and grips his arm.

VOICE (0.S.)
Vultures!

EVERETT
Jesus!

VOICE (0.S.)

Already the vultures come!

Everett pulls away, staggers, hits a desk, and fumbles
for the lamp switch. He turns it on. In the light, he
sees an ELDERLY MAN sitting on the edge of Michelle's
huge circular bed. He is slumped and droopy, but he is
watching Everett like a hawk.

MAN
So steal. Go ahead.

EVERETT
Mr. Ziegler?

The Man makes no reply, but he sighs and slumps even
further.

EVERETT
I'm not a thief, Mr. Ziegler. I'ma
friend of Michelle's. A colleague.
Worked with her at the paper.

(CONTINUED)
104.
109 CONTINUED: 109

MR. ZIEGLER
My friends, most of them knock.

EVERETT
Right. Sorry.
(beat)
I'm sorry about Michelle. I liked her a
lot. She was a terrific reporter. Top-
notch.

MR. ZIEGLER
So you come to give the eulogy?

EVERETT
No, I -- she was working on a story.
See, there's a man, an innocent man, and
they're going to execute him tonight.
And I think there may be something in
these papers that could save his life.

MR. ZIEGLER
Something Michelle did?

EVERETT
Yeah. She was onto something. That's
why I --

MR. ZIEGLER
So look.

Everett glances at his watch: 6:45. He starts rummaging
through boxes. As he does, Mr. Ziegler talks to him ina
far-away voice.

During the next few exchanges, we INTERCUT Everett's
searching with Mr. Ziegler's talking and CLOSEUPS OF what
Everett finds among Michelle's boxes: photos of
atrocities, notes about other murder trials, pictures of
chalk outlines, a bag of marijuana, etc. Dust rises in
the air, and Everett coughs as he works.

MR. ZIEGLER
I've been going through her things, too.
You see this?

He holds up a little plastic horse. Everett looks up
politely, but he's getting increasingly desperate.

MR. ZIEGLER
Gave it to her when she was nine. She
loved it. Know what she named it?

(CONTINUED)
105.
109 CONTINUED: (2) 109

EVERETT
(checking his watch)
No. What?

MR. ZIEGLER
Mr. Id. Can you imagine that? Nine
years old. Mr. Id. Oh, she saved
everything. Look at this. I don't know
when she did it -- must have been four
or five.

He holds up a child's drawing. Not exactly "Green
Pastures," but remarkably similar. Everett takes a
cursory glance, and then looks again.

PICTURE

A daddy separated from a mommy and small daughter by a
vast field. It's signed, "Gail."

EVERETT (0.S.)
Do you know where you found this?

CLOSE ON MATERIAL
dumped on the dining table.

Everett's hand feverishly combing through the pile of
documents, photos, clippings, tapes, and notes, all
pertaining to the Beachum case.

PULL BACK to show Mr. Ziegler is standing now, watching
Everett work. Everett doesn't notice a notebook that he
has dropped. Achingly, rheumatically, Mr. Ziegler bends
down and picks it up.

MR. ZIEGLER
This anything?

EVERETT
(not even looking up)
What?

MR. ZIEGLER
Says, ‘Warren Russel. Seventeen years.
4331 Knight Street. Interviewed July
seventh at own request.'

Everett grabs the notebook and reads.

EVERETT
‘Bought soda and left. Saw nothing.
Something fishy here?'
(looking up)
Thank you, Mr. Ziegler. Michelle -- she
would have been one of the best.

INT. DEATHWATCH CELL 110
Luther Plunkitt walks quietly to Frank's cell. Reedy
sits behind him and types in the chronological: "19:04
-- Warden Plunkitt enters Deathwatch cell."
Plunkitt lifts one hand in a gesture of apology.
PLUNKITT
Sorry, Frank. We're gonna have to ask
Mrs. Beachum to leave now.

BEACHUM
Give us a minute, okay?

PLUNKITT
Sure.

Plunkitt retreats, and Frank and Bonnie face each other.

BONNIE
Oh God.

BEACHUM
No. No, baby.

BONNIE

I swear I don't know how I'm gonna...

BEACHUM
I won't get a chance later, you know, to
say good-bye. You take care of our
little girl, Bonnie.

BONNIE
You know I will, baby.

Beachum hands her the letter he wrote for Gail.

BEACHUM
And you give her this. Don't forget.
It's not much, but it's the only thing!--

He stops, struggles for composure.

BONNIE
It'll be precious to her, Frank. It'll
be her most precious thing.

Her tears are falling now. Beachum's voice is trembling.

BEACHUM
I sure didn't mean for this to happen to
us, Bonnie. I meant to be there for
you.

107.
110 CONTINUED: 110

BEACHUM (CONT'D)
I wanted -- I wanted to see my little
daughter grow up. Now you're gonna have
to do that for the both of us, Bonnie.

BONNIE
We gotta be thankful for the time we
had, Frank. It's just -- it was too

short. It was so short, Frank.

BEACHUM
Least we made Gail together. We made
something beautiful in this world. When
you look at her, you gotta remember me,
all right? Can you do that?

BONNIE
Oh, Frank, I'm so scared.

BEACHUM
If I can see you, you know? At the end
there, if I can see your face...

BONNIE
I'm gonna be there, Frank. And I'll
talk to you. Every day I'll talk to
you.

BEACHUM
You talk to me, baby. I'm gonna need to
hear you talking to me.

Crying, she studies his face, trying to memorize it.
Beachum bites his lip, but it quivers anyway. Finally,
Bonnie collapses in his arms, and they both break down,

sobbing.

BONNIE

Oh God, Frank. How did this ever happen

to us?
BEACHUM

God bless you, Bonnie. You gave me the

only life I had that was worth a damn.

God bless you, baby. God bless you.

111 EXT. BROWNSTONE TENEMENT - NIGHT 111

An upstairs window. An elderly black woman, ANGELA
RUSSEL, pokes her head out and looks down.

MRS. RUSSEL

Everett is standing on the stoop, ringing her bell.
Behind him, some very young, very tough-looking kids are
circling his car.

EVERETT
Steve Everett, ma'am. I'm a reporter
with the News.

 

The window slams shut. Everett waits for a moment,
wondering, eyeing the nasty-looking kids.

The door opens. Mrs. Russel is a powerful-looking woman
in her fifties. She wears a shapeless floral housedress
that ends at the shoulders and the knees, and she twists
a gold locket that she wears around her neck. Suddenly
she yells.

MRS. RUSSEL
Go home!

Everett is startled. It takes him a moment to realize
that she is yelling at the kids behind him.

MRS. RUSSEL
Quit casing that man's car. It's your
dinner time. Go home.

The kids edge away sulkily. Mrs. Russel examines
Everett.

MRS. RUSSEL
Sorry about them kids.

EVERETT
No, that's all right. I'm just so, I
mean I'm amazed I could find you here
after six years --

MRS. RUSSEL
You thought I mighta moved to the
suburbs?
(beat)
Come on in.

She turns and Everett follows her in.

INT. MRS. RUSSEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 112

It is stifling and airless. Mrs. Russel opens a window.
The steady DIN of TRAFFIC fills the room. The room is
sparsely furnished -- a rocking chair, a TV, a ratty
couch, a dresser with pictures on it.

(CONTINUED)
109.

112 CONTINUED: 112

EVERETT

So you're...
MRS. RUSSEL

Angela Russel.
EVERETT

And Warren...
MRS. RUSSEL

My grandson.

Everett has caught sight of a picture on Mrs. Russell's
dresser. We see it, too -- a younger Mrs. Russel with a
smiling teenager wearing a backward baseball cap.

EVERETT
That Warren?

MRS. RUSSEL
It is. You wanna tell me why you're
here?

EVERETT

Mrs. Russel, it's very important that I
talk to Warren. I need to see him
tonight.

MRS. RUSSEL
Is that right? And what could be so
important, if you don't mind my askin'?

EVERETT
There's a man on death row, and he's
going to be executed tonight. They say
he killed this grocery store cashier Amy
Wilson six years ago. I think he's
innocent. And I also think your

grandson may have... may know something
about it.
MRS. RUSSEL
Now why would you think a thing like
that?
EVERETT
Because he was the only other one there.
MRS. RUSSEL
Oh? And how do we know that?
EVERETT
Because... the witnesses didn't see

anybody else.

(CONTINUED)
110.
112 CONTINUED: (2) 112

MRS. RUSSEL
So there was witnesses even though
nobody else was there? Now help me out
here. I'm getting confused.

EVERETT
All right, yes. There were two witnesses.
An accountant and a housewife.

MRS. RUSSEL
White people.

EVERETT
Yes...

MRS. RUSSEL

And I'll just bet that Amy Wilson was
white too, wasn't she?

EVERETT
She was, but I don't think --

MRS. RUSSEL
You don't think these nice white people
would ever kill that nice white girl. But
they all looked around and, whaddaya know,
there was a black boy.

EVERETT
No, it wasn't like that. It was!-- Mrs.
Russel, think back. Six years ago. Was
Warren using drugs?

MRS. RUSSEL
(as if to an idiot)
Yeah. He was using drugs.

EVERETT
Does he own a gun -- or did he then?

MRS. RUSSEL
Oh, they all got guns, Mr. Everett.
Don't you know that? All those black
drug-fiend boys got guns.

EVERETT
Can I just talk to him, Mrs. Russel? Do
you know where he is?

MRS. RUSSEL
Yes, I do. And no, you can't.

EVERETT
An innocent man is going to be killed!

MRS. RUSSEL
Well, I seen a lot of innocent folks get
killed in this part of town. But it's
funny: I ain't never seen you here
before.

EVERETT
Mrs. Russel, I know you think this is a
race thing. It's not a race thing.
That innocent man on death row -- he's
black, too. Did you know that? They're
going to kill him at midnight. I'm just
-- I just need to know the facts.

MRS. RUSSEL
Only fact I know, Mr. Everett, is that
my grandson Warren been in his grave now
going on three years. Stabbed out there
in the park.

She wraps her hands around the locket and is suddenly
near tears.

MRS. RUSSEL
My Warren was a loving child. And I
didn't see you coming around looking for
the facts when he was killed. No one
came around looking for the facts then.

EXT./INT. EVERETT'S CAR 113

Everett is driving, fumbling with his RADIO, getting
STATIC. He bangs on it angrily -- we can see he's
frustrated and upset, and not principally about the
radio.

EVERETT
(banging)
Loser!... Fuck!

He finally finds a station that comes in clearly.

RADIO NEWSCASTER (0.S.)

last meal he requested earlier -- steak

Everett's face: thunderstruck.

RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

governor's office says that despite
Beachum's expression of remorse for the
murders of Amy Wilson and her unborn
child six years ago, the execution
will proceed as scheduled at one
minute after midnight tonight.

EXT. SERVICE STATION - ADJACENT TO DEAD MAN'S CURVE - 114
NIGHT

Everett pulls up next to the shattered remains of
Michelle's car. He gets out, slams the door, and strides
over to the nearby vending machine. He drops in some
quarters, and pushes the Dr. Pepper button. The can
drops down with a loud THUNK. Everett takes it out and
heads back toward his car, but when he reaches the ruins
of Michelle's car, he stops, drops the Dr. Pepper, and
squats down. He rocks for a moment in despair, seemingly
communing with the hole in the shattered windshield.

The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the hole, INTO the dark. There,
strangely, we see Everett's little daughter, Kate. He
is looking out at us curiously. He reaches up and...

INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 115

her bedside, gazing at his daughter. Kate strokes the
hair on her father's forearm thoughtfully.

KATE

Where else would I be, silly?

EVERETT

It disappeared. Poof!

He makes a magician's gesture with his hands. Kate looks
at him uncomprehendingly.

EVERETT
Hey. Sorry about today at the zoo. But
I'll make it up to you, okay? You wanna
go this weekend? We'll do Slow Zoo.

KATE
And can we see the hippopotamus?

EVERETT
Oh yeah. I already called him. He's
expecting us.

KATE
(fondly)
My little daddy... I will go to sleep
now.

EVERETT
Good move.

He stands and moves to the door. For a moment, he
watches his daughter lying there. Kate turns her head
and peeks at Everett. Seeing him still there makes the
girl smile.

EVERETT
Go to sleep, darlin'.

He turns out the lights and goes into the hall outside.
For a moment, he pauses and leans against the wall with
his head bowed.

INT. EVERETT'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara is sitting over an empty cup of coffee, rubbing
the fingers of her left hand with her right. Everett

he cannot. Then he looks at what she's doing with her
hands.

Everett -- as she can.
BARBARA

If that were a bullet, you'd be dead.

Everett picks up the ring and examines it. The
inscription on the inner curve reads: "Steve and
Barbara." A long silence.

EVERETT
So I guess -- what? Bob called you?

BARBARA
What's the difference who called me?

Everett shrugs. Right; makes no difference.

BARBARA
It's over, Ev. I know you're going to
apologize. I know you'll try and do
better. Honey, it's too late.

EVERETT

Won't this be kind of... hard on the
kid?
BARBARA

Good time to think of it, Ev.

EVERETT
Look, I can change. Can't we just erase
all this? I've had a ridiculous,
terrible day -- everything I did was
wrong. Everything I thought was --

BARBARA

EVERETT

Yeah, but today was the end of it.
Today I understood -- Look, I know I'm
easily tempted. I know that. But is
that so -- Barbara, I love you. I'm

facts and think you know something.
Your hunches are shit, Ev. Even when

It's the same bar we see Everett in at the beginning of

Tonight, Everett is back on the bottle. The bartender,
Neil, pours him another. ON the TV, a BALL GAME.

NEIL
You sure you want to do this, Ev?
EVERETT
Does a bear shit... on Goldilocks?
NEIL

fumbles it.

As it spins on the counter, we SLIGHTLY OVERCRANK. On

I'm sorry. It's Fourth of July. We
haven't been that busy.

Warren stares at her, hopped up, not ready to go yet.
Amy is weeping with fright.

CLOSE ON AMY'S LOCKET
It glints in the sun. We can see the initials: "A.R."
Warren points the gun at the locket around Amy's throat.

WARREN
Gimme that. Quick!

Amy moves her hand protectively toward the locket, which
is hanging on her chest, just below her throat.

AMY
(crying out)
Please! Not that!

In the rear of the store, the TOILET FLUSHES. Warren
looks back toward the bathroom, startled.

His face: wide-eyed.

Suddenly he SHOOTS Amy in the chest. Amy falls back behind
the counter, gurgling.

In a flash, Warren is on top of her. He rips the locket
from around her neck and pulls a ring off her finger. We
can hear the bathroom DOOR OPENING. He sees the service
entrance, jumps up and runs out.

We see him scampering through the service entryway, out
the screen door, through the parking lot to his beat-up
car. The MOTOR is already RUNNING. Warren jumps in,

tosses the locket on the seat beside him, and PEELS OUT.

We see Warren's car leave the parking lot and drive.

About a block away, a man is mowing his lawn and looks up

at the car.

INT./EXT. WARREN'S CAR - THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD - DAY 121
Warren drives. An oncoming car. It is Porterhouse.

Steam is coming from his hood, and Porterhouse is looking

desperately at his dashboard indicators.

We PULL BACK, and now we are looking at the locket on TV.

INT. GORDON'S BAR - NIGHT (PRESENT) 122

Everett, thunderstruck, drunk out of his mind. He
wobbles determinedly toward the door. Neil is still
watching the TV.

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
(to his co-anchor)

And, still on the Beachum execution

story, you'll recall that report we got

about an hour ago in which...

Everett has reached the door. He grabs the handle and
pulls it open. The edge smacks into his forehead --
hard. It draws blood.

EVERETT
Ow! Shit!

Blood seeps down his brow and onto his fingers. Neil
notices him leaving and yells after him, but Everett is
already gone.

NEIL
I hope you're not driving, Ev! Hey, Ev!

Neil turns his attention back to the TV, and we PAN UP TO
it.

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
... Frank Beachum was said to have
confessed his crime. Well, apparently
that report was in error. We're now
told that Beachum has not confessed and
is still scheduled to go to his
execution just about an hour from now
without having expressed a word of
remorse for the killing six years ago of
twenty-year-old co-ed Amy Wilson...

INT. DEATHWATCH CORRIDOR - NIGHT 123
Four guards head toward Beachum's cell. Each carries a

plastic riot shield; rubber truncheons dangle from their
belts. The lead guard carries a brown paper bag.

INT. BEACHUM'S CELL 124

The door snaps open. Beachum bolts upright, his eyes
darting between the clock and Luther Plunkitt. Beachum
is sitting with his own pastor, REVEREND FLOWERS, who now
rises. The lead guard hands the paper bag to Plunkitt.

PLUNKITT
Reverend Flowers, I'm just going to ask
you to step into another room for a
moment, all right?

Flowers nods, nods to Beachum, and steps away. We can
hear Reedy in the b.g., typing the chronological.

PLUNKITT
Now, Frank, this is the change of
clothes we talked about. I'm gonna ask
you now to put these clothes on,
including the special underpants that
are provided for hygienic reasons. This
is required, and I have to ask you if
you're going to give me any problems
with this.

Beachum passively accepts the bag.

PLUNKITT
Good. Now, it would be wise at this
point, Frank, if you took the
opportunity to use the toilet, for your
own comfort. Since there might not be
an opportunity later on. I'1l wait
outside.

Plunkitt exits. Beachum stares at the paper bag in his
hands.

KEE-RUNCH! We BASH into the rear of a CAR sitting at a
red light. The car slams into the car in front of it.
Sounds of SHATTERED HEADLIGHTS and TAILLIGHTS dripping to
the pavement.

Angry drivers emerge from their cars. Everett backs up.

Everett starts to drive away, making a huge arc around
them.

Everett moves into the intersection against the red
light. A car entering from across street smashes on its
brakes. Everett clips the car's rear fender, leaving a
nice crater.

INT. DEATHWATCH CELL 126

Helpless and childlike, Beachum stands in his blue
plastic diapers. Quickly, he covers them with loose
green trousers.

EXT. PRISON GATES - NIGHT 127

Reporters are gathered alongside a number of protestors
holding a candlelight vigil and a handful of death-
penalty supporters. A WILMA FRANCIS confers with her
FIELD PRODUCER. Their crew eavesdrops.

WILMA FRANCIS
So there are two executioners? What,
they each have a button?

FIELD PRODUCER
They each have a button, but a computer
scrambles the circuits so nobody knows
which button actually does the trick.

WILMA FRANCIS
Can we talk to one of them?

FIELD PRODUCER
They're kept anonymous. For security
reasons.

WILMA FRANCIS
Man, can you imagine? Who are these
guys?

CLOSE ON LETHAL INJECTION MACHINE 128

The tubes leading through the wall, a red button that
will activate the plungers, a black button that shuts
everything down, and another red button to activate the
plungers. We PULL BACK to reveal a heavy man standing
next to the second red button.

He is the second executioner. He scans the room. There
is Reuben Skycock, hovering near the machine. Beyond
him, stands McCardle, next to the shelf of colored
phones. There are Dr. Waters and his nurse. The second
executioner looks down at his watch, then up again. Now
he spies the man he's looking for: the executioner, the
man we have been following throughout the film.

The executioner comes to the machine, shakes Skycock's
hand, nods to the second executioner, and assumes his
position next to the first red button.

EXT. ANGELA RUSSEL'S STREET - NIGHT 129

Dark and scary, with the same mean-looking kids hanging
out.

Suddenly, Everett's battered CAR comes SCREAMING around
the corner. The kids take one look and scatter. The car
mounts the sidewalk, smashes into a garbage can, slips
back down into the street and comes to a STEAMING,
shuddering halt. We hear a DISTANT BELCH.

INT. PRISON VISITOR'S ROOM - NIGHT 130
The wall clock reads: 11:30.

PANNING DOWN, we FIND Bonnie Beachum sitting alone among
the plastic tables and chairs. The loud BANGING of a
METAL DOOR opening startles her. A PRISON CUSTODIAN
sticks his head in.

CUSTODIAN
Oh. Sorry.

The door bangs shut. Bonnie folds her hand in her skirt.
Her sunken eyes stare at nothing.

EXT. ANGELA RUSSEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 131

Everett leans on the BUZZER. He looks up. The windows
are dark. Everett looks at his watch: 11:32. He jams
the BUZZER AGAIN AND AGAIN, the frustration building in
him. Then he hits the door, hammering the frame with his
already-bloody fist. He kicks it. Finally he collapses
against the door, the wood against the blood on his
forehead. He groans, extends his arms along the wood,
and then slumps, the energy oozing out of him. One last
slap.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK. And then... Angela Russel opens
the door. She is wearing a bathrobe.

EVERETT

We gotta hurry, Mr. Everett.

A little stunned, and very drunk, Everett grabs Mrs.
Russel's arm, and they head toward his car.

MRS. RUSSEL
That Robertson man -- on the T.V., you
know, the girl's father. I saw him.
And then I started in remembering that
night when Warren gave me that locket --

EVERETT
Because it had the same initials!--

MRS. RUSSEL
Her maiden name, and I was remembering
Warren's face that night -- oh, I could
always read that boy's face.

Suddenly Mrs. Russel is near tears.

MRS. RUSSEL
Oh God, Warren. Warren. He did a real
bad thing, Mr. Everett. He wasn't a bad
boy, but I know he did a real bad thing.

They get in the car.

Beachum down the corridor to the death chamber. Reverend
Flowers strides behind the procession.

refuge and my fortress; my God; in Him
will I trust. Surely He shall deliver
thee from the snare of the fowler...

EXT./INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 134

The car is zooming along. Everett's driving is erratic,
to say the least. But his mind is on something else.

EVERETT
(half to himself)
The locket is good. The locket is good,
but...

MRS. RUSSEL
There's this boy sold Warren a gun
around that time.

EVERETT
What?

MRS. RUSSEL
He's in jail -- this boy. Might talk to
them if they give him some time off.

Everett turns toward her, and the car veers.

EVERETT
I could kiss you.

MRS. RUSSEL
Watch the damn road!

INT. DEATH CHAMBER 135

Beachum is watching the strap-down team, a ghostly, empty
look on his face. When the gurney is ready, the strap-
down team very quickly lifts him onto it. He looks up at
the clock. The men pull the leather straps across his
body and fasten them.

EXT. CITY STREETS - HELICOPTER SHOT - NIGHT 136
Everett's car rips recklessly through an intersection,
fishtails wildly, almost loses it, recovers, and
accelerates hard, the ENGINE cranked to its limit. The
car spews blue smoke.
INT. EVERETT'S CAR - MOVING WITH ABANDON - NIGHT 137

Everett passes a row of cars in the oncoming lane. Mrs.
Russel pushes against the dashboard with both hands.

MRS. RUSSEL
You drunk, now aren't I right?
EVERETT
Yes, ma'am.
MRS. RUSSEL

You a terrible driver, you know that?

A city bus looms ahead. Everett's car careens wildly to
avoid it.

EVERETT
Yes, ma'am.

MRS. RUSSEL
Let me drive. What kind of white man
drives a shitbox like this anyway?

Suddenly the car is filled with red and white light --
and the sound of SIRENS.

CLOSE ON REAR-VIEW MIRROR

A police cruiser is following them, and we see a second
one come skidding out of a McDonald's lot.

MRS. RUSSEL
Gun it, mister!

Everett flashes her a scary grin.

EVERETT
We go fast.

INT. DEATH CHAMBER 138
A nurse snaps Beachum's sheet down to his waist. She
attaches two pads to his chest and runs the wires over

the gurney's side.

NURSE

NURSE
This'1l be easier if you make a fist.

CLOSE ON PLUNKITT
watching, hoping she'll find the vein easily.

She does. The connecting tube runs over the wall. She
sticks two Band-Aids over the needle in an X to hold it
fast. She tugs the sheet back up to Beachum's throat.

Plunkitt watches Beachum's face. It's the face of any
frightened patient on a gurney, looking to a nurse for
reassurance. To his chagrin, Plunkitt finds his right
hand trembling against his pants leg. He slips the hand
into his pocket and moves to a more private corner of the
room. He takes a deep breath.

CLOSE ON EVERETT'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR 139

One of the cruisers zigs to the side and overtakes
Everett.

INT./EXT. EVERETT'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Everett looks out the window and sees the side of the
cruiser edging closer his car. He hears the cop's
LOUDSPEAKER.

COP (V.O.)
Pull over! Pull over and stop the car!

Everett takes his foot off the gas and the car slows at
once.

MRS. RUSSEL
Well, don't slow down now!

The cruiser moves in front of Everett's car and we see
its brake lights flare. That's when Everett hauls the
steering wheel to the left and stomps on the gas.

Everett's car shoots forward into the empty pocket left
by the cruiser. Everett speeds into the night as the
cruisers get going again behind him.

MRS. RUSSEL

stilled by straps, Beachum's eyes dart around the room.
They find Plunkitt talking softly to a guard; the
sweeping hands of the clock; the saline solution running
into Beachum's arm; and finally the window behind which
the witnesses will sit.

Beachum hears the sounds of PLASTIC BENCHES SCRAPING

behind the blinds as they enter the room. Is Bonnie

there? He peers into the dark.

The world goes by in a carousel blur.

The two cruisers lift into the air as they break across
the curb. One slides into the car lot. The other
follows and SMASHES broadside into the first one's TRUNK.
Both cars sit, smoldering, while the police inside them
slowly climb out.

Everett straightens the car out and hits the gas.

EVERETT
They really ought to do something about
that place.

He looks over at Mrs. Russel. She stares straight ahead,
her jaw dropped, her body as rigid as a tree trunk.

MRS. RUSSEL
Now that's some driving.

INT. LOWENSTEIN HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 145

A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS QUIETLY. On the STEREO,
DEBUSSY'S "Clair de Lune." A Persian rug, rare books, a
dainty escritoire by the window. MRS. LOWENSTEIN is bent
over her needlework. Mr. Lowenstein, the paper's owner
and the governor's pal, sits in a leather wing chair,
writing a letter.

SIRENS. DISTANT at first, but insistent.

LOWENSTEIN
Must be something going on.

MRS. LOWENSTEIN
A fire, maybe. Or another accident up
on the curve.

Another sound. A RUMBLING, CLATTERING sound.

Mr. Lowenstein glances at the grandfather clock: 11:48.
He stands, pulling his bathrobe closed over his silk
pajamas. He moves to the window and peers out toward the
street below.

He replaces the phone and presses the intercom button.
Zachary Platt, the deputy warden, picks up McCardle's
call.

McCARDLE (0.S.)

Platt nods to Plunkitt. Plunkitt looks at the clock.
Midnight. He removes the folded death warrant from his
pocket. Platt pulls a cord that raises the blinds
covering the witness window.

WITNESS ROOM POV - THROUGH WINDOW

The stark white death chamber. The gurney. Beachum's
face poking out from beneath the white sheet. Plunkitt

Bonnie moves to the window.

Beachum says nothing, but scans the window, which we now
see to be one-way glass. He can see only the chamber's
reflection.

Unseen by Beachum, Bonnie presses her face against the
window and mouths the silent words, "I love you."

Plunkitt looks at the clock. The second hand is sweeping
up to 12:01. McCardle looks toward Plunkitt. He waits
for a signal.

The executioner's hand lingers near the red button. He
waits.

Platt glances at a clock. Thirty seconds past 12:01.
The guard near him lifts an eyebrow.

McCardle looks at Plunkitt, then at the clock. It's
sweeping past 12:02.

MOVING CLOSER ON Plunkitt. He appears to be frozen.
CLOSER INTO his face and then his eyes, still and
distant. Slowly, he turns TOWARD CAMERA and nods deeply
to the mirror.

McCardle nods. The executioner nods. Both executioners
look at each other, ready to coordinate their actions.

They push the red buttons.
BONNIE'S FACE
Full of anguish and love.
BEACHUM'S FACE

Looking desperately for her, mouthing the words, "I love

you" to the empty glass.

WIDEN -- the first syringe, the sodium pentothal,
plunging slowly down.

The arm tube with the sodium pentothal streaming through
it.

Platt is frozen. McCardle is speechless. The

Suddenly Plunkitt is moving, looking neither right or
left, pushing through the death chamber like a broken-
field runner. In a single motion, he rips away the Band-
Aid from Beachum's arm and brings the IV tube with it.

He throws it to the ground. Blood spurts from Beachum's
arm. Solution spurts from the writhing IV tube on the
ground.

BONNIE'S FACE

Breathless, speechless, silently screaming. Behind her,
the witnesses are on their feet.

BEACHUM'S FACE
Eyes closed, empty, gone.

PLUNKITT
Doctor! We gotta save this man's life!

Dr. Waters is standing in the corner, within eyesight of
the lethal injection console. He looks at it. The first
syringe is completely empty, but the other two are still
full. The second plunger begins to go down.

DR. WATERS
It's only the pentothal! Nurse!

Dr. Waters, the nurse, McCardle, and two guards converge
on Beachum's gurney. Platt reaches over and pushes the
black button. The lethal-injection CONSOLE HISSES to a
halt.

A strange BANGING sound. It is --

Everett comes out of the mall, breathes in the cool air,
and lights a cigarette. Behind him and a few yards away,
the Santa Claus is plying his trade. The voice is
familiar.

SANTA CLAUS
Gimme some charity. Gimme some charity
here on toast. It's for kids. It's

Everett whirls. It's the Pussy Man in a Santa Claus
costume, his red-streaked eyes peering from under the
elf's cap.

EVERETT
Shit.

PUSSY MAN

rides alone.

Just then he hears a child's voice.

VOICE
Da-deee! Come on!

He turns. There, in the parking lot, is Frank Beachum
being pulled along by his daughter, Gail. Bonnie is with
him, laughing happily. Beachum suddenly stops when he
sees Everett.

GAIL
Come on, Daddy! Come on now!

Beachum stays another moment, giving Everett a long look.
And Everett looks back intently, a bit the way he looked
into the eyes of Porterhouse, and Beachum, too, that day
in the prison. Then, slowly, Beachum raises his hand,
lays his finger against his eyebrow, then lowers the
finger and points it at Everett in a kind of salute.

Everett raises his cigarette and tilts it back at him,
and Beach laughs. Then Gail pulls him away, and Beachum
wraps his arm around Bonnie's shoulder. The three of
them go off. Everett smiles a deep, satisfied smile.

He tosses his cigarette into the gutter and walks away.

FADE OUT.
