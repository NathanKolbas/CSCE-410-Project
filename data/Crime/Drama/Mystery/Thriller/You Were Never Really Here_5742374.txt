INT. TITLES SEQUENCE 1

Close-up: An adult man’s mouth under water (Joe). He gulps in
water.

E.C.U:
A CLEAR PLASTIC BAG, filled with air, stretched smooth.

The inside surface mists - droplets of moisture form - break
into miniature rivulets...

O.S. The whisper of a BOY’S VOICE (Young Joe) counting down -
“...1001, 1000, 999, 998, 997..."
With a sharp inhale the clear plastic inverts.

The face of A MAN (Joe) as the bag is suddenly sucked hard
onto his skin, distorting his features into an inhuman mask.

O.S. The boy’s counting suspends. The faint beat of a pulse
rises to replace it.

The man exhales. The bag balloons again, clouding with his
breath. The man breathes again, slowly, the plastic bag
balloons and inverts.

O.S. The boy’s monotone whisper resumes -

“...996, 995, 994..."

The man never blinks beneath the plastic, eyes unseeing, its
rise and fall around his mouth and nose the only sign of
life.

TITLES END.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, CINCINNATI - NIGHT 2

MONTAGE - glimpses of a methodical process. Camera tight,
sounds heightened...

A GIRL’S FACE, filling the frame - a passport style
photograph...

...16-years-old, smiling, a hint of lip gloss and eye shadow,
lightly Latin features. The image appears to dance and
flicker with an inner light.

Slowly at first the picture darkens, then rapidly distorts
and blackens. With a HISS fire and smoke erupt through the
girls face as the photograph curls up in flame.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 1A.

WIDER: The burning shards of photograph drop into a small
metal trash can.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 2.
The rising smoke is staunched with a heavy bound book dumped
onto the rim of the trash can -
HOLY BIBLE
QUICK CUTS: A man’s hands, pries open a cell phone - pink
case, appliqué plastic gemstones, dangling charm - removing
the battery and SIM card.
Large tacky gold earrings slide into a zip-lock plastic bag.
A cheap gold necklace follows; the pendant reads ‘SANDY’.
The bag is sealed.

The hands hold open a white plastic laundry bag. Items laid
out on the bed are —scooped into the bag one by one:-

A baseball cap...
A roll of silver duct tape...
A bundle of heavy duty black plastic zip ties...

CLOSE ON: A ceiling smoke detector as the condom that has
been stretched over it is pulled free.

The blackened scraps from the trash can are shaken into the
laundry bag.

A flip form prepaid cell phone as it strains between gloved
hands. With a CRACK the hinge shatters. The two halves go
into the laundry bag.

A BALL PEEN HAMMER, lying the length of a bathroom hand
towel. FRESH BLOOD on its head. The hammer is wiped with the
towel and both items drop into the laundry bag. The bag is
closed tight.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, 2ND FLOOR, CINCINNATI - NIGHT 3

Low angle on the man’s torso as he emerges, the laundry bag
dangling at his hip.

CLOSE ON the bag as he makes his way stealthily down the
dingy corridor.

Rounding a corner a WOMAN hones into view.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 3.

The man hangs back. With her back to him the Woman tweaks
down the hem of her barely there skirt, then struts away to
the waiting elevator.

CUT TO:
A hotel cleaning service trolley, left by the door to the
service stairwell. The man dumps the bag in the trash and
slips through the door.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY, CINCINNATI - NIGHT 4
The check-in desk is unmanned.

O.S. The 10 O’clock headlines on WKRC Local 12 news.

The man moves silently from the stairwell fire door, his head
shrouded by his jacket hood.

A portable TV flickers in a back room - a glimpse of the fat
belly of the RECEPTIONIST in front of it as the man glides
past...

He stops short of the glass doors leading into the street as
a POLICE CRUISER’S lights kick in outside.

Head down, he pauses to one side of the doors, his back
pressed against the wall.

THE MAN’S VIEW: through the doors is a sliver of street
activity - the Police Cruiser idles 20 yards from the Hotel
as cops on the sidewalk size up the local dregs.

The Hotel Receptionist moves an unseen item of food from his
lap to his mouth.

Tensions rise on the street, a cop’s hand drops to his
holster...

The Hotel desk phone rings. The Receptionist begins to stand
eyes still glued to the screen...

The Man swiftly doubles back through the lobby to the service
stairwell...
INT. NIGHT. HOTEL CORRIDOR 1ST FLOOR, CINCINNATI - NIGHT 5

The man slips from the stairwell, past the open elevator and
down the corridor to the fire exit doors at the far end...

Throughout his—passage through the hotel nobody has seen him.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 4.

EXT. CINCINNATI HOTEL FIRE EXIT, BACK ALLEY - NIGHT 6

HIGH ANGLE as the fire exit swings open and the man slips
out.

CLOSE ON: His impassive face - hard, mask-like, mournful
eyes.

This is JOE (35-45), plaid shirt, jacket, baseball cap under
raised hood.

JOE'S POV of the ground, dozens of dead birds litter the
alleyway around the exit.

Ahead of him a BLACK SUV eases across the mouth of the
alleyway, slowing to a halt.

Joe turns in the opposite direction...

Out of the shadow of a doorway, a MAN steps out behind him,
arm aloft, brandishing a blackjack.

Joe senses something behind him... The presence of life...
The coming of violence...

He turns in time to catch the blackjack on his left shoulder
instead of taking a brutal blow to the head.

Joe grabs his assailant’s wrist.

Joe brings his forehead down like a brick into the bridge of
the man’s nose... The sickening sound of splintering bone.

Blinded by red pain the man begins to double up. Joe brings
his knee up hard into his jaw.

He goes down, strings cut, paralyzed by fear.

Joe swings his head from left to right, shakes out his left
arm, trying to get life into it.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 5.
The assailant alone in the alley, vomits.

EXT. CINCINNATI STREET - NIGHT 7

The passenger door of a yellow cab slams shut to reveal its
emblem;

G&Y Cab of Cincinnati.
JOE (0.S.)
Airport.
INT. CINCINNATI TAXI - NIGHT 8

CLOSE ON: the tired lined mouth of the ELDERLY CAB DRIVER as
he replies with a grunt.

CUT TO:
Joe stares ahead.

Joe's POV in the rear view mirror as the cab driver’s lips
dip in an out of view in the strobing streetlights.

The driver appears to silently mouth.
“You"

“Were”

“Never”

“Really”

“Here”...

Each word appears on screen as a title, then fades, as the
driver appears to speak them.

INT. NYC AIRPORT ARRIVALS HALL - NIGHT 9

CLOSE ON the spinning pad of a floor polisher - its DRONE
reverberates around the empty arrivals hall.

CUT TO:
WIDE on a lone TEENAGE GIRL asleep on a bench, her head
propped on her knapsack.

Bent double at a water fountain, Joe watches her from across
the gleaming concourse, his face shaded under the brim of his
cap. He takes a mouthful of water.

CUT TO:
INT. LA GUARDIA AIRPORT ARRIVALS HALL - MOMENTS LATER 10
Joe's fingers tapping digits on a pay phone.
CUT TO:
Joe’s mouth pressed to the receiver.
JOE
It’s done.
He hangs up.
EXT. KENSINGTON, BROOKLYN - NIGHT 11

The suburban neighborhood sleeps through the dead of night.

Joe steps out of an NYC Yellow Cab and waits on the kerb;
watching till it turns out of view at the far intersection.

With his head down he walks to the other end of the avenue
before slinking a footpath between blocks.

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 12
Joe approaches the back entrance to the house on the end of a

row and stoops down, removing a THIN WOODEN BATON from under
the door sill. He slips it behind the drainpipe.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 6A.

Taking care to make no sound he turns his key in the lock and
eases the back door open.
13

14

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 7.
O.S. The faint METALLIC SOUND of footsteps and the clink of
glass.

His hand still on the door Joe’s attention is on the fire
escape of the block overlooking his house.

CUT TO:
A SKINNY TEENAGE BOY (MOISES, 14) crouches on the 3rd floor
fire gantry, his body frozen as he holds down smoke from the
joint in his hand. A 2nd BOY is climbing through an open
apartment window to join him - two beer bottles in one hand.
Moises and Joe’s looks hold.

A beat - Moises’ expression melts from recognition to fear as
he lets go of his lungful of marijuana.

Joe turns away, closing his back door behind him.

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 13

Joe stands in the doorway to the living room as cold light
dances on his face.

O.S. TV sound blaring - The Bad and the Beautiful on TCM
JOE'S MOTHER (80s) - in house dress and slippers - is asleep
in a chair. On the wall above her a framed photograph of
JOE'S LATE FATHER in Marine Corps dress uniform. The TV
reflects on the glasses slumped on the bridge of her nose.
Joe flicks off the TV plunging the room into stillness.

He removes her glasses with care, setting them down on a
table beside her HEARING AID.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 14

Joe stands at the foot of the stairs. His mother is obscured
from view by the bannister.

JOE'S MOTHER (0.S.)
I’m not a baby.

She steps into view as Joe steps back to let her pass. She
takes the stairs, moving at a snail’s pace, one step to the
next.

ON Joe as he watches her tedious progress upstairs.
15

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 7A.

INT. BEDROOM, MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 15

Joe places his mother delicately on her bed, drawing up the
covers.

The window is ajar. The curtain billows as a chill blows
through the room.
16

17

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 8.

CLOSE ON: Joe as he pulls the window to.
O.S. A sharp creak from the bed.

JOE
It's freezing Mom...

He turns back to the window. His hand rests on the handle.

A beat.

In one fell swoop Joe fastens the window shut and breaks from
the room, never looking back over to his Mother’s bed.

OMITTED 16

INT. JOE'S BEDROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT 17

Joe lies rigid on top of his bed covers. His eyes pop open,
he cannot move, he tries to scream, no sound comes out, an
episode of night terrors. (o.s) The sound of dripping water.
He struggles to let out a moan. He is now awake, sweating.

Joe sits up in bed, we see a vicious bruise on his left
shoulder. His body, a network of scars.
18

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 9.

O.S. Water POURS and SPLASHES insistently

In one clean move Joe bolts from the bed to the door.

INT. HALLWAY, MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 18
Behind Joe as he watches his mother from his bedroom.
The bathroom door is ajar.

The Mothers pewter hair, reaches her waist. She is wrapped in
her robe, giving herself a shampoo in the hand basin. She
rinses, then throws her head back, like a young woman. The
hair snaps out in an arc, like a long silvery rope.

OFF Joe’s look - the floor of the bathroom is awash with
soapy water. Joe sighs at the sight of the soapy water
cumulating on the floor.

INT. BATHROOM, MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 19

Joe on his hands and knees, works a towel to soak up the
soapy water from the tile.

INT. KITCHEN, MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAWN 20
The radio is on - very loud - a 40’S CROONER.

Joe stands in the kitchen, wearing a suit and tie. His
mother’s frail wrinkled hands smooth out his unkempt hair,
her hands move to his beard which she also attempting to
groom.

JOES MOTHER’
Why do you hide that beautiful
face?

She then straightens and adjusts his tie. Joe’s face, mildly
annoyed.

CUT TO:
Joe's mother’s frail hands crack two eggs into a frying pan,
the sizzling oil mute beneath the drone of the radio. Her
deaf ears oblivious to the noise.

CUT TO:
CLOSE ON Joe’s fingertip as it pokes into the middle of one

of the frying eggs, destroying the perfect sunny side up. She
turns to him, annoyed.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 9A.

He smiles at her. She can’t help but laugh. Then shoos him
away, turning back to the stove.

Joe sits at the kitchen table.
21

B21

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 10.

He faces his mother’s back.

His mother glances back to him.

She smiles turns back.

Joe's POV CLOSE ON his mother’s frail hands as she struggles
to lift the weight of the frying pan from the stove.

INT. KITCHEN, MOTHER'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING (LATER) 21

Joe and his mother sit at the table in silence, their
breakfast finished.

O.S. The radio still droning.

She is looking at him, questioning. She widens her eyes

asking without words... ‘Where have you been?’.... ‘What do
you do?’
She tilts her head, raises her shoulders - her eyes

searching his with sympathy and a deep resignation.
Joe mimics her gesture like a mime.

She throws her hands up - mad at him - and moves unsteadily
to clear the plates.

Joe puts his hands over hers to stop her, takes the plate and
moves to the sink. She watches his shoulders as he begins to
wash-up.

INT. JOE’S BEDROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY. A21
Joe sits on the edge of his bed, his shirt slipped down off
one arm. He holds an ice pack to the deep bruise blooming
across his right shoulder. Frozen. The other hand works a

stress ball for exercise..

JOE'S MOTHER (0.S.)
Joe?.... Joe?

Joe visibly tenses.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BATHROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY. B21

Joe stands resting his forehead against the wall. 0.S. We
hear the sound of the toilet flushing. Joe moves away with
resignation.
22

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 10A.

INT. LIVING ROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY 22

TCM blares from the TV. Joe’s mother watches from her
armchair.

Joe sits on a couch close to his mother, he is falling
asleep. His tie is undone, his suit jacket resting on a
chair.

O.S. OLD WESTERN ON TV - COWBOYS AND INDIANS GUNFIRE.

EXT. DUSTY GROUND - DUSK (JOE’S MEMORY) 23

CLOSE ON: A pair of girl’s BARE FEET lying on dusty ground.
Her heels intermittently kick at the earth beneath her.

A miniature ditch dug in the sand.
INT. LIVING ROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY(LATER - BACK TO 24
PRESENT)

Blinding sunlight glints off a framed photograph of a YOUNGER
JOE in ceremonial military dress.

Sunrise touches the living room walls.

Joe’ Mother is in her armchair in front of the TV.

EXT. JOE’S MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 25

Through the LIVING ROOM WINDOW - Joe’s Mother stares past the
TV to the street. A smile on her face, turns to a darker past
memory...

INT. JOE'S BEDROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY. 26

Joe sits upright on a chair that he’s dragged into the open
doorway of the walk-in cupboard. DRY CLEANING covers hang by
his head.

CLOSE ON - Joe’s feet. His shoelaces are untied. He uses

one foot to lever off a shoe. He places a socked foot onto
the floorboards ahead of him - the floorboard creaks as he

places his weight.

A bare patch of skin above Joe’s sock reveals an old but
pronounced scar.

Joe has a belt looped around his neck, the end of the belt is
looped over a clothing rail, he pulls tightly on the belt.

INT. DINING ROOM, MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 27
Late afternoon sun.

Joe & his Mother are sat across the corner of the dining
table. Open in front of them is a large mahogany CUTLERY
CASE. They are both engrossed in polishing its contents.
Joe's mother sings “A you’re adorable” as they clean, they
both sign out each letter of the alphabet.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 11A.

The Mother’s frail hands move slowly. Joe buffs like a
machine.

He holds a silver SOUP SPOON right in front of his mother’s
mouth. She exhales onto the back of the spoon. Joe gives it
a finishing rub.

INT. DINING ROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY (LATER) 28
CLOSE ON - JOE prizes open a tin of BICARBONATE OF SODA.

Heavily tarnished silverware lies in a baking tray on the
dining table - larger items, serving spoons, a ladle.

Joe scatters BICARBONATE onto them.

He unscrews the cap of a bottle of white vinegar and passes
it to his mother.

With trembling hands she pours it over the cutlery. The
Bicarbonate foams up impressively.

INT. DINING ROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON. 29
CLOSE ON: Joe Mother’s hearing aid, tucked behind her ear.
She is back in front of the TV - a blanket across her knees.

At the dining table Joe fits the last of the immaculately
cleaned silver back into its case.

JOE'S MOTHER (0.S.)
How’s Janice?

CLOSE ON: a FORK slots into it’s place.

JOE
We broke up in High School Mom.

The MAHOGANY CASE in closed and latched.

EXT. ANGEL’S BODEGA - NEXT MORNING 29A
Joe stands caddy corner looking towards the window of a
bodega. He checks his watch; 9AM.

INT. JOE’S BEDROOM, MOTHER’S HOUSE - LATER 30
Joe sits on the edge of the bed, he is wearing jeans and
sleeveless T-shirt, his hands wrapped around his own neck,

pressure applied to his throat, his face, beat red.

JOE'S MOTHER (0.S.)
Joe... Joe..

Joe lets out a deep sigh, Joe on the verge of tears.

LATER:

EXT. REAR ENTRANCE, MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY 31
Joe takes the baton from its hiding place behind the
drainpipe and stoops to carefully position it under the door
sill - tucking it out of casual view - then slips into the
deserted alley.

He has a way of moving quickly, invisibly. Hardly anyone has
seen him enter this house, ever.

EXT. SIDE STREET ACROSS FROM SIXTY THIRD DRIVE - DAY 32

Joe leans against a wall. He watches the store across the
street.

‘ANGEL'S BODEGA’...

‘24/7 ‘ALWAYS OPEN!’

EXT. APARTMENT ABOVE ANGEL'S BODEGA - DAY 33
Joe's POV - a STOUT MAN comes to the upstairs window. He
peeps through the dirty net curtains, then moves out of
sight.

EXT. SIDE STREET ACROSS FROM SIXTY THIRD DRIVE - DAY 34
Joe checks his watch (black, analogue dial, Military issue).
...a few seconds till 10 a.m.

Joe's POV - in the Bodega window, a sign reading:

Egg and Bacon Sandwich $1.50. In removable letters, like a
cinema sign.

The silhouette of the same stout man from upstairs reaches
into the window display and removes the sign.

Beat.
The man replaces the sign. The letters now read:
Egg and Bacons Sandwich $1.50

Joe registers the misspelled sign - his cue from the dead
drop. He heads across the road to the Bodega.

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 14.

INT. ANGEL'S BODEGA - DAY 35
The shop is empty of customers.

O.S. A crude bell ring from the opening door.

Moises, the tall skinny kid who spotted Joe entering his
Mom’s house, busies himself rearranging goods on the shelf
beside the counter. He immediately averts his gaze from Joe.
His hands are shaking.

The loud clatter of a stack of tomato cans falling to the
floor. They roll asunder in an aisle.

ANGEL, a stout middle-aged man, emerges from the stock room
with an angry look to Moises.

Joe quickly moves towards the stockroom, Angel follows.

INT. ANGEL'S BODEGA, STOCK ROOM - DAY 36

Angel grabs a small step stool and places it on the floor, he
climbs up and reaches into a broken ceiling tile. His hand
fishes around for a moment, he pulls out an envelope that he
hands to Joe.

Joe opens the envelope, takes out a bound $5000 wad. He
skims $500 and hands it back to ANGEL, who immediately pushes
it into his shirt top pocket.

ANGEL
The man called... He wants to see
you. Right away.

A small army of cockroaches scoot across the chipped floor
tiles between the two men.

JOE
Did your son tell you he saw me?

ANGEL
(like a military response)
He was with friend, just a
coincidence.

JOE
Did he tell you where he saw me?

Angel hesitates.

ANGEL
No, I knew you wouldn’t want me to
know...

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 15.

ANGEL (CONT'D)
Moises didn’t mean to see you,
he’s a good boy....

Joe eyes bore into Angel, it is clear he isn’t lying.

Joe gives a slight shrug of resignation and closes his eyes
slowly and gently, almost as if he is falling asleep whilst
standing. He skims another $500 from his wad and hands it to
Angel.

There's a looks of sadness in Angel’s eyes as he takes it -
this is severance pay and he knows it. His days as Joe’s
dead drop have been terminated.

Joe exits the back room without speaking, moving in the
liquid way that is his custom.
INT. QUEENS PLAZA SUBWAY STATION, F LINE PLATFORM - DAY 37

Joe stands sentinel on the platform edge, his baseball cap
pulled low.

Further up the platform a YOUNG WOMAN with a bruise under her
eye stares impassively toward Joe.

O.S. The rattle of an approaching train rises in volume.

CLOSE ON Joe's feet as he begins to step across the yellow
line that marks the platform safe zone. Mid stride his foot
hovers momentarily over the precipice...

CUT TO:
The train strobes onto the platform with a deafening battle
of brakes and metal. Joe is gone.

INT. MIDDAY. MANHATTAN, 38TH STREET AND 8TH AVE - DAY 38
From the end of the corridor lobby Joe walks towards us.
Elevator doors begin to close around our view until a suited
arm appears in the field of vision and holds them back. The
doors shiver then begin to slide open again. Joe ignores
them and steps neatly off to one side - out of view.

CUT TO:
A BEIGE ACCOUNTANT TYPE slouched in the elevator - The man

who held the closing doors back. He scowls at his gesture
being ignored.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 15A.

Joe shades his eyes under his baseball cap, hits the bottom
of the stairwell. The Accountant shrugs, the elevator doors
push shut.

INT. MCCLEARY’S OFFICE, 8TH FLOOR - MORNING 39

A man has his head tipped back, a blood soaked tissue clamped
to his nose. He breathes methodically through his mouth... *

He lifts the blood soaked tissue for Joe to see.

MCCLEARY

How are you? *
JOE

I didn’t try to kill myself

today.

WIDER - The room is cluttered with ornate floral displays
parked up on the floor and filing cabinets.

MCCLEARY
(laughing) *
The Cincinnati kid... Parents *
are... florists... *

Joe rubs his bruised shoulder. And smiles. He reaches forward
and grabs some candy from McCleary’s desk, his tone shifts... *

JOE
Get rid of Angel’s number I’'11l

Okay no problem...

McCleary reaches for the Rolodex and scoots it

index cards.
MCCLEARY (CONT’D)
++-You could just call me
directly.
Joe, eyes still closed.

JOE
Why am I here?

McCleary sighs.

MCCLEARY.
State Senator Albert Votto...

Joe plays with the candy as McCleary continues.

MCCLEARY
I ran his father’s security in
the 80s?... Lost touch with him

after the arraignment, then -
poof - aneurysm burst in his
brain...

Joe now half asleep, closes his eyes again.

MCCLEARY (CONT’D)
The wife, Votto Jr's wife,
kills herself a couple of years
ago. Not a good look in
politics. Their daughter's been
running away from home ever
since. Picked up by the Albany
police every time. A ‘problem
child’.

(beat)

Are you fucking going to sleep
again on me you bastard?

Joe now awake.

MCCLEARY (CONT’D)
Votto calls me this morning,
she’s been missing all weekend.
Doesn't want the cops involved -
now that he’s in Senator
Williams camp. Too much heat
from the press.

JOE

MCCLEARY
He got an anonymous text...

McCleary reaches out a sealed brown envelope.

JOE
You're fucking kidding... why?

MCCLEARY
Five grand. That’s ten percent
of your cut.

McCleary catches Joe’s look as he slides the envelope
forward...

He consults a sheet of paper on the desk.

MCCLEARY (CONT’D)
[His Club] Be there at 2 P.m... And
try and behave. Remember Joe, 4 out
of 5 people enjoy Gang Rape.
Where shall I have your flowers
sent?

JOE
You keep them John, they really
tie the room together.

McCleary references the photo of his [deceased] wife.

MCCLEARY
Josephine loved flowers and
shit, God bless her. Never saw
the point to them myself - die
anyway and stink up the place.

McCleary indicates at the brown envelope on the desk.

Joe stands, takes the brown envelope, taps it against
McCleary’s desk, heads for the door.

Joe, at odds with the finery of the ornate lobby, moves with

doors open for the clientele.

Joe breezes by, pulling the peak of his ballcap low over his
brow. He steps neatly through the door to the service
stairwell.

INT. SERVICE STAIRWELL, LOTTE NY PALACE HOTEL - DAY 45
Joe makes his way up, head tucked low, his face obscured from
the gaze of the CCTV cameras on every landing.

INT. GOVERNOR'S SUITE, LOTTE NY PALACE HOTEL - DAY 46

A YOUNG MALE ASSISTANT (20s) opens the double doors.

A huge suite, sumptuously decorated - original artwork on the
walls.

A hard, high backed dining chair has been placed facing the
sofa. It stands isolated on a sea of thick carpeting.

A HANDSOME MAN (40s) is sitting on a sofa, elegantly dressed.
He takes to his feet, bounds to Joe.

VOTTO
Albert Votto...
(offering his hand)
Joe isn’t it... Joe or Joseph?

The Assistant delicately closes the double doors behind him,
leaving Votto and Joe alone. Joe is sweating hard from his
walk up the 52 flights of stairs.

JOE
Joe...

Votto has Joe’s hand in a firm handshake. He places his
other hand on top of Joe’s - intimate, smiling warmly.

vVoTTto.
Thank you for taking the time

Joe still breathing heavy from his walk. Votto releases his

grip.

He gestures Joe to sit.

They sit,

McCleary I was just a boy.
Trusted him with his life.

a sleek coffee table lies between the two men.

Joe removes his baseball cap.

Joe nods.

JOE
Sex-trafficking task force...
My work for McCleary... more or
less the same thing.

Votto’s phone on the coffee table buzzes. He glances at it,
doesn’t pick up. It drops to voicemail, stops
vibrating...then buzzes again.

Votto snatches it up, skims his thumb down the screen.

VOTTO
Fuck.
(As if the name of the
state capitol were
poison)
Albany. (something about
political stuff)

He stands and grasps a clear plastic file and places it in
front of Joe.

VOTTO (CONT'D)
I got a text message this
morning. Anonymous.

Joe reads the text as Votto paces.

VOTTO (CONT'D)
(by heart)
‘Your daughter is at 544 West
38th street I couldn’t live
with myself if I didn’t let you
know’....

Joe leans forward and leafs through the loose assortment of
print-outs in the file - scans of Family photographs.

A PRETTY LITTLE RICH GIRL on a pony.

AN EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (40s).
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 24.

Joe slides a small instant photographic print from the back
of the file. Overexposed by the flash, a close-up selfie of
the girl - she is giving a cute sidelong look and has her
index finger raised to her lips in a “Shhhhh” gesture.

JOE
When was this taken?

VOTTO
It’s the most recent.

JOE
Was her hair still long when...

VOTTO
Yes.
(Beat)
She has beautiful hair...
They never found her body
(his voice wavers)

Joe watches as Votto picks up a pack of Marlboros from the
arm of the sofa.

Votto tears into the seal and draws a cigarette to his mouth.
He pats down his pocket searching for a light. He takes the
cigarette from his lips, looks at it pitifully.

VOTTO (CONT'D)
(mervous aside)

$25,000 a night and the State

of New York won’t even let me

light this on the terrace...

Votto picks up his phone, scrolls through his messages, hands
it to Joe.

JOE
Whoever sent the message
would've bought the phone...

VOTTO
(overlapping Joe)
...It must be someone I know.

JOE
.--sent the text, threw the
phone away.

VOTTO

Votto picks up one of the photos of Nina.
Joe places Votto’s phone down on the coffee table.
Votto paces, turning his cigarette pack in his hands.

VOTTO (CONT'D)
(on his back)
Do you have children Joe?

Another photograph - formally posed, the girl wears a white
party dress as Votto holds her in an embrace, their eyes both
closed, his chin resting on the crown of her head.

Joe selects the earlier selfie of the girl AND A FAMILY
PORTRAIT - NINA between Her Mother and Father.

JOE
I’1l need these.

Votto nods. Joe slips it into his shirt top pocket.

JOE (CONT'D)
Does your daughter take any
medication? Girls are often
kept sedated with morphine
derivatives.

VOTTO
Anti-depressants... her mother
lived on them.

VOTTO (CONT'D)

He has his phone in his hand.

Votto begins to pour himself a drink from a brandy
decanter.

The searing midday sun.

A young Afghan girl is walking towards the camera, hand
outstretched.

A younger, Joe (20s fresh-faced, dressed in army fatigues) is
on the other side of a chainlink fence.

He sits on a crudely made bench, drinking coffee, eating an
MRE.

Beyond Joe 6 soldiers mill about and dance together to a 1991
Pop Hit playing from a parked vehicle in the background.

He takes note of the girl, reaches into his pocket and pulls
out a bar of chocolate.

The girl smiles, candy bar in hand, turns from Joe and runs
away.

EXT. KUWAIT - LATER 63

Joe looks up to the lone tree where the girl is sitting in
the shade.

A TEENAGE BOY (15) has approached her - he is standing above
her, holding his hand out.

The girls shakes her head, “No”.

The boy shouts something inaudible at the girl, his face
suddenly aggressive. She shakes her head again, trying to
hide the chocolate in the folds of her skirt.

The boy pulls a makarov pistol from his pocket - he shoots
the girl in the stomach, snatches the chocolate from her hand
and runs off.

A slow pool of blood forms around the girl as her bare heels
kick fast and furtively at the dusty ground.
EXT. US MILITARY BASE, KUWAIT - LATER STILL 64

Joe's POV - the girl’s legs are still kicking through the
dust but with increasing sluggishness.

CUT TO:

JOE'S HANDS grip the steering wheel, his knuckles whiten in
frustration and anger...

The distant sound of the truck engine running over rises in
volume.

Joe's eyes shrouded in darkness.

The sharp sodium street light throws sad shadows of raindrops
onto Joe’s rigid face, his jaw tenses.

Fumes continue to plume from the truck’s exhaust...

water patterns in the wiper’s wake. His 1000 yard stare
draws into closer focus.

Rear-view mirror: Joe watches as...

The TOWEL BOY, in jeans and a thick hooded sweat shirt,
emerges from the brothel front door - sent out on an errand.

Joe studies him - he’s clearly not a ‘John’ or security.

He darts from the car.

He binds Towel Boy’s wrists behind his back with a cable tie,
then fastens his legs together at the ankles and the knee.

Towel Boy’s eyes start to focus, he gasps a little less
audibly.

Joe eases off the back seat, exits the rear door and returns
to the drivers seat. He faces forward, eyes locked back on
the rear view mirror.

JOE
How many security inside?

Towel Boy is too scared to answer. Joe’s hand lowers to rest
on the box cutter, his thumb poised over the blades sliding
mechanism.

JOE (CONT'D)

gasping)
One guy guards the first floor,

A YOUNG GIRL (13/14) lies on top of a white sheet.

Joe walks towards her.

Her skin has a spectral glow.

...-NINA?

Joe takes the photograph from his top pocket.

The girl’s eyes are closed. He puts a hand to her cheek - no
reaction. He gently raises one eyelid between his finger and
thumb. For a moment there is a bright blue iris anda
dilated pupil before her eye rolls back.

Joe is taken aback. It’s HER.

Her neck arches back into the pillow and her whole body
begins to stiffen.

Joe leans in and levers the girl’s thin body into a seated
position. Her head and arms flop forward like a rag doll.
He lifts her chin with his free hand.

JOE
Nina... NINA.

He snaps his fingers loudly beside her ear.
JOE (CONT'D)
Nina. Come on Nina. You can hear
me. Look at me. Can you say your
name Nina.

A SHARP intake of breath and the girl’s head lolls forward
again.

Joe firmly cups her tiny face in his hand. Her eyes flicker
open for a moment. Her lips move against each other.

It is barely audible but she is counting.
She is in the 700’s.
CUT TO:
The BIG SISTER, a skinny, diet pill blonde in a silk robe and

artificial tits bursts into the room. She clutches a cell
phone in one hand.

BIG SISTER

Fuck is YOU?

Joe advances on her, grabbing her elbow violently, prizing
the cell phone from her grasp.

JOE
Get her dressed.

Joe throws the Big Sister towards Nina. In shock she gets her
off the bed. The only additional clothing in the room is a
pair of childish frilled pop socks.

Joe reaches the cell phone jammer from his jacket pocket. He
slides the switch on its side, the green LED blinks off. He
puts it away and then wrenches off his jacket.

Joe advances again on the Big Sister and thrusts the jacket
at her to dress Nina with.

With his other hand he dials 911 on the Big Sister’s cell
phone and clamps it to her ear.

He glares into her eyes. She understands.

JOE (CONT'D)

She shakes her head vigorously. Punches her own hand
repeatedly on her head.

She is paralysed with fear, won't move.

Throughout all this Nina has stood dazed and silent in the
middle of the room

Joe snatches his hammer up, grabs the sheet from the bed,
wraps it once around Nina and scoops her off her feet.

The 2nd fallen Guard still fills one half of the width of the

A NAKED JOHN stands in the corridor, blocking Joe’s passage.
He grasps a 7" hunting knife in one hand. His chest is
emblazoned with an Eye of Providence tattoo.

Joe gently lets down Nina. She ahead stares implacably.

follow a pace behind.

EXT. BROTHEL - NIGHT 87

At the top of the stoop Joe peers down the street - no cop
cars.

About six minutes have elapsed since Joe entered the brothel.

With the girl light in his arms, he moves quickly to his
rental. In one delicate move he has Nina in the front seat.
She is all but out of it; but not completely.

Stepping around the trunk of the car Joe flings open the rear
passenger door and drags Towel Boy out by the shoulders and
dumps him on the sidewalk.

CLOSE ON: A storm drain opening. Joe crouches by the kerb as
he fits the bloodied hammer through the opening, dropping it
as deeply as his arm will reach inside. The cell phone
jammer from his inside jacket pocket follows the hammer into
the storm drain.

INT. BASEMENT CAR PARK - MOMENTS LATER 91
Joe relaxes his grip on the steering wheel.
Nina’s gaze is fixed on him... on his right arm.

She reaches forward and touches him with her fingertips.
There’s a 2” knife cut through his shirt and blood is soaking
through. Joe hasn’t noticed till now.

Nina stares at her fingertips, mesmerized by the scarlet
blood coating them.

Joe unbuckles his seat belt and flips open the glove
compartment. He removes a sanitary napkin and rubbing
alcohol, he pours some on the napkin and places it over his
wound.

CLOSE ON: in the rear view mirror, Joe’s mouth clenches tight
against the searing pain, jaw set as his teeth grit hard.

She continues to watch with fascination as Joe goes through
the process of attending to his wound.

NINA
What do I call you?

Joe hands her a make-up wipe to remove the blood from her
fingers.

Joe reaches for the can of Coke and chocolate and hands them
to Nina.

NINA (CONT'D)
Where are we going?

pull. She abandons it half cocked and hands it back to Joe.
He pops it open.

JOE
I'm taking you home Nina.

NINA
How do you know my name?

JOE
Your Father told me your name.

Nina alternates sips from the Coke can with squares of
chocolate.

NINA
Is he angry at me?

O.S. The sound of an approaching car - the clump as it takes
the entrance ramp to the car park, the dry echo of tires on
concrete...

Joe's eyes fix on the rear view mirror as the headlights of
an anonymous sedan sweep past his car. He turns the ignition
key just enough to fire the electrics and adjusts the angle
of his door mirror.

In the mirror he can see the sedan as it pulls up, an
indistinct figure at the wheel. Joe wipes a discreet
porthole in the condensation building up on his window to
reveal - a man in a tuxedo and black tie as he hurries away
in the direction of the exit ramp. Satisfied, Joe turns his
attention back to Nina.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 46.

She has eaten almost all the chocolate, some of which has
smeared onto her lips and cheeks. A crudely drawn smiley
face adorns her passenger window.

Nina burps. She raises a hand to her mouth and peers over it -
surprised and off guard.

Joe's face wears a massive grin in response.

Nina offers Joe the last square of chocolate in the packet.
He shakes his head.

Nina is unwavering in her offer.

JOE
It’s the last piece...
NINA (0.S.)
..-It’s not the last piece in the

world...

He takes it from her and puts it into his mouth. He closes
his eyes and allows himself to relax back into his seat.

O.S. - A distinctive clunk as Nina releases the latch of her
seat belt. A rasp as the nylon belt retracts.

Joe looks over to her.

NINA (CONT'D)
I need to go...

JOE
We have to stay here.

Nina’s look is one of confusion and disappointment.

CUT TO:
The passenger door of the car is wide open. Joe stands
sentinel beside the door, arms folded around his jacket, head
tipped forward. He cautiously steals a look up to the
security camera perched at the top of a concrete support
pillar opposite him then dips his eyes to the ground again.
O.S. The sound of running water.
A stream of liquid, dark against the pale concrete floor of
the parking garage, runs from under the door of the car
behind Joe, pooling near his boots.

He edges to one side to avoid Nina’s amassing pee.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 47-47A.

NINA (0.S.)
What’s your name?
JOE
(Beat)
Joe.
NINA (0.S.)

I've finished Joe.

CUT TO:
Nina and Joe are back in the car. She no longer wears Joe’s
jacket.

Nina leans forward and grabs the bottle of pills, she shakes

them. She fails to open the bottle, Joe takes it from her. He
demonstrates taking off the cap, he then puts the cap back on
and stashes the bottle OUT OF HER REACH.

Nina sits back in her seat.

She slips the straps of her nightie off her shoulders then
begins to hitch the hem up her tiny thighs. She meets Joe’s
gaze with a look of mute seduction and raises her forefinger
to her lips in a gesture of ‘shhhh’.

ON Joe.

NINA (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Don’t tell Mommy...

Wordlessly Joe leans past her, grasps the dangling seat belt
buckle.

Nina flings her arms around him and buries her face in his
chest.

Joe firmly draws the seat belt back across her, untangling
her arms from around his neck, breaking the moment - a simple
signal that she should stop.

Nina slumps into her seat. Her head rolls back to the
passenger side window. The smiley face on the glass beside
her has begun to run - tears of a clown.

CUT TO:
From outside the glass CLOSE ON Nina

Her eyelids draw closed; asleep.

CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: Joe’s wristwatch; 4:02 am

Nina is fast asleep.

EXT. SENTON HOTEL - NIGHT 92
The rental car pulls up right out front, its pouring again.

A BELL-HOP GUY (20's, iPod earbuds)rounds the corner and
heads towards the hotel. In his hand he clutches a pair of
well-worn drumsticks.

A beat later ANOTHER MAN (30's, acne scarred, homebrew neck
tattoo) emerges, throwing his rucksack over his shoulder. The
two have an exchange as they cross paths, he then disappears
along the street.

Joe takes the room key (card) from the glove compartment.

The bell-hop guy has his back turned whilst he struggles into
an ill fitting jacket.
INT. LOBBY, SENTON HOTEL - NIGHT 93

Kitsch lounge musak pipes soothing piano into the low rent
surroundings.

Joe carries Nina ‘piggy back’ past the reception booth. Her
hair sticks to her wet face, she is still dozing, her dirty
bare feet hang loosely by Joe's side. He takes to the bottom
of the stairs.

On Joe’s back as he disappears from view.

The Bell-hop taps out a ‘rim shot’ on the reception desk with
his drumsticks oblivious to Joe’s entrance.

INT. STAIRWELL, SENTON HOTEL - NIGHT 94
Musak from the lobby fades, giving way to a heightened mix of
sounds passing through closed hotel room doors - porn, moving

furniture, a muffled cry.

Joe carries Nina.

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 49.

She rests her head on his shoulder, hovering between sleep
and wakefulness - obscenely childlike in the harsh lighting.

NINA
(whispered, barely
audible)
Mommy went away.
JOE
(gently rocking her)
Shhhh.
INT. SENTON HOTEL, ROOM 719 - NIGHT 95

CLOSE ON the photographs Joe took from Votto. Nina holds them
between finger and thumb, studying them intently.

The OVEREXPOSED SELFIE -

NINA (0.S.)
Is that me?

She is sat in the one armchair in the room, Joe’s jacket
drawn around her shoulders. Joe reaches in with a wet wipe
and smooths away chocolate smears from her face.

JOE
Uh-huh.

As Joe wipes, Nina pulls a face. Joe takes a fresh wipe. As
it hones in towards Nina’s face she deliberately goes CROSS-
EYED. She bursts out giggling.

ON JOE - He cannot help but smile.

He stands to throw the used wipes into the hotel room trash
can.

CLOSE ON the family portrait photograph. Nina covers over
her FATHER’S FACE with her thumb. Then cover’s over her
MOTHER’s FACE with her other thumb.

Nina lowers the photo, her eyes drawn to the TV screen which
flickers away with the sound down, she reaches for the remote
and begins to channel-hop.

A 24h newscast - an accident scene in midtown Manhattan,
police line, emergency lights. Followed by a montage of
archive shots of a suited middle aged man giving a speech at
the U.S. Senate - the name ‘Senator Williams’ on the chyron.

NINA
The crying man.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 499A.

Her finger points to the TV.

Joe looks up. The news cast cuts to a studio anchor, a
portrait photograph of SENATOR WILLIAMS emblazoned with
“SUICIDE?” displayed beside them.

O.S. The electronic mechanical sound of the room key
unlocking the door.

Joe immediately stands and darts to the door.
It opens.
The drumming BELL HOP stands in the doorway.

A BRIGHT FLASH OF LIGHT and the explosion of a firing gun.
His forehead erupts.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 50.

CLOSE ON: Joe’s face as the BELL HOP’s blood spatters over
him.

TWO MEN with raised pistols.

The ALPHA of the pair twitches his gun, gesturing Joe into
the living area of the room, seating him at the foot of the
bed next to Nina, she turns the tv off.

The OTHER MAN holsters his weapon and crosses to Nina,
slinging her over his shoulder like a money sack. He heads
for the door.

NINA (CONT'D)

snaps shut.

«JOE...

Alpha stands over Joe, raises his gun full stock...

ALPHA
(RE: Nina )
Cute.

In an instant Joe propels himself from the bed. He lunges
full length towards the coffee table, planting his palms on
its top surface, launching it across the floor into the
Alpha’s knees.

A cellphone flies from the Alpha’s hand as he crashes
forward, his legs now pinned between the splintered table and
the far wall.

CUT TO:
Joe moving in rapid, assured movements as he claws himself up
the teetering man. In three solid grasps of the man’s
clothing he has himself level with his torso - going for
control of his wrist and the weapon...
The man tries in vain to angle the 9mm on Joe.
A SHOT rings out.

Alpha chops at the back of Joe’s head with the butt of the
gun, landing a sharp vicious blow.

CUT TO:

Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 51.
Joe keeps climbing. Both men collapse into the remnants of
the crushed coffee table.

Joe's left hand is on the wrist that holds the pistol. He
pushes it away.

His eyes are screwed shut against the pain of the blow to his
head, some unseeing snake part of his brain takes over.
Everything is impression and feeling.
O.S. A deadened gunshot....

CUT TO:

.».smacks straight into the CEILING MIRROR ABOVE THE BED,
fracturing the glass right across its length...

We see the last of the struggle in the fragmented reflection.

A cubist tableau - two distorted figures writhe on the deep

red carpet.

A THIRD GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.

For a moment it’s impossible to tell who has the upper hand.
CUT TO:

CLOSE ON, Joe gets both hands under Alpha’s chin and with all

his strength pushes the man’s head back past any natural

angle. The NECK SNAPS.

Alpha goes still.

Joe rolls off panting, his vision returning, the blurry room
coming slowly back to focus.

He scrambles to his feet, takes the man’s pistol.

CLOSE ON: The photograph of Nina as Joe snatches it up.

INT. SENTON HOTEL HALLWAY, 7TH FLOOR - NIGHT 96
Joe, the pistol in one hand, hauls ass down the hallway. A

A bottle of rubbing alcohol, cotton wool roll, roll of gauze
and a carded pair of NEEDLE NOSE ELECTRICAL PLIERS - pushed
across the counter.

Behind a scratched plastic window the cashier barely
registers Joe or what he is buying, his eyes fixed on a small
TV on the counter.

O.S. TV news program covering the apparent ‘suicide’ of
Senator Williams IN SPANISH.

The TV news cuts to an outside broadcast.

A taxi’s caved in roof - the scene flashes red and blue from

Joe pays cash. There is BLOOD on his hands and the $50 bill
he pays with.

His RIGHT HAND CHEEK is swollen. Thick blood mattes his jaw
and throat.

The cashier doesn’t raise an eyebrow.

EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT 99

Joe propped up against the side of a building, rain falls
around him. A stray dog, sniffs around the area.

Joe eases the PLIERS into his open mouth. He digs around
taking time to get purchase, deep inside.

Joe suppresses the need to scream.

EXTREME CLOSE UP: A BROKEN TOOTH - a Molar, split in two.
Joe's bloodied fingertips set it down.

Joe collapses back.

A heavy padlock. Several FBI agents stand by with flashlights
fixed on the truck.

CLOSE ON- Dollar bills slowly flapping in a puddle.
Heavy duty bolt croppers bite into the hardened steel.

With a GASP of rushing air the tall rear door of the truck
swings open to reveal Joe.

Rain streams from the brim of his cap.

JOE'S POV - the gloom of the truck interior gives way to a
tableau resembling Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa...

...TWENTY FOUR CHINESE GIRLS.
IT IS TOO LATE.
They are all dead.

Their barely clad bodies entwined in the dark, eyes open,
heads cast back, mouths agape.

CLOSE ON Joe: closing in on his narrowed eyes.

CLOSE ON two of the dead girls. Neither older than 14, their
faces framed by long black hair, cheeks pressed together in
eternal embrace.

CLOSER STILL - A distinct mole on an upper lip. The mouth
strained wide...

O.S. The rising pitch of a dialling tone.

FADE OUT:

EXT. MIDTOWN, MANHATTAN. NIGHT 101

Joe leans against a battered pay phone. He fishes the
receiver to his ear. His cheek is wrapped with a pad of
gauze, crudely taped in place. Blood is smeared over his
face and hands like iodine.

It connects straight to a phone company digital voicemail.

A simple, white clapboard two storey affair backing on to an
ocean view. A pristine 20 year old CADDY is parked in the
driveway - a 90's ‘classic’.

A Manhattan Taxi U-turns and diminishes towards the turn off.
Joe watches till he sees the blink of its signal light then
passes the gleaming Caddy towards the rear of the house.

INT. MCCLEARY’S HOUSE, KITCHEN SIDE ENTRANCE - DAWN 103

Joe moves through the kitchen. 0.S. Radio on in the adjacent
living area.

A HUGE PERSIAN CAT laps at a vast pool of milk from an
upturned carton beside the sink. It looks up to meet Joe's
gaze. Then returns to the milk.

The splattered microwave door hangs open.

An old school coffee percolator stands beside the fridge.
An 1/8th inch of stewed coffee bubbles furiously in the
bottom of it’s glass jug. Joe pulls the plug at the wall.

arranged in an ordered crescent on the dresser.

INT. MCCLEARY’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAWN 106
Joe is sat on the sofa.

Around Joe is evidence that this is McCleary’s place of
sleep. A feather pillow and blanket, a few empty beer
bottles, an old fashioned porno mag, ‘Power & Motoryacht’.

CLOSE ON, A framed photo on a cupboard - A younger, slimmer
McCleary, shoulder to shoulder with SENATOR VOTTO SNR - the
spit of his son. Beside them stands the 20 year old Votto
Jr. McCleary is being handed a gold clock for 10 years
service, the mood is jovial - smiles all round.

Other photographs line the walls and mantelpiece - marking
the progress of McCleary from state trooper - to a more
portly man in a suit.

Interspersed are photographs of McCleary and his wife.
Different ages but all images of a loving couple...

A black and white wedding picture of the once handsome pair
cutting the cake....

Halloween fancy dress costume - they are Laurel and Hardy.

From the deck of a yacht, they beam at the camera in a tight
embrace. She is noticeably more gaunt, a silk scarf tied
around her head hiding her lack of hair.

The Persian Cat leaps onto the coffee table. Its back arches
as Joe runs his hand across it.

Joe looks like death - driving as fast as the limit allows.

Sweat dots his brow, he constantly checks the rear view
mirror and the few passing cars on the road.

He winces, pops one of the painkillers he bought from his
Midtown drug dealer. It is almost impossible for him to part
his lips.

His head lolls slightly forward.

O.S. The SOUND OF THE CAR ENGINE, loud, quickening, continues

The room is a jungle of gaudy wilted flowers. McCleary’s
body sits at his high backed desk chair. He is wearing a
towelling dressing gown and slippers - eyes closed, mouth
slightly agape.

The only sign of disarray is the shattered Rolodex, its index
cards spread out across the glass top of the desk like a
blackjack table.

JOE

Oh John.

CLOSE ON: the Rolodex card bearing Angel's details as Joe
turns it over in his hands. Dried blood foxes the edges.

The shrouded form of Joe’s Mother lies in state across a
broad rock at the water’s edge.

EXT. WOODLAND, LAKE - DUSK 140

UNDERWATER: Joe’s feet stumble across the coarse shale of the
lake bed.

Joe wades chest deep into the river pushing his Mother’s
corpse ahead of him. Flat rocks weigh her down so that she
barely touches the surface of the water.

He gently immerses the plastic bundle and with his fingertips
tears open a small hole to the side of her head.

Snow white hair pours out into the black water, wafting like
reeds.

Silently the black plastic crimps and flexes as air leaches
from it. As Joe walks deeper the small body slowly sinks
below the surface in his arms.

The water reaches his eyes.

UNDERWATER - The pockets of his suit bulge with rocks from
the lakeside.

He takes another step forward and disappears under the
surface.

CUT TO:

UNDERWATER: In a limitless black void Joe and his mother are
in embrace.

The black shroud, cocooned tight around her. She seems tiny,
the size of child as he clings to her.

Her silver hair loosens and wafts in the water, whirling
around his head and shoulders...glinting, beckoning strands
of light.

Joe's mother’s shroud descends into the depths.

Joe drifts away from her.

Joe's eyes snap open in an underwater churn of bubbles

On his wide eyes...

He closes his mouth, his chest clenches.

JOE'S POV - UNDERWATER, against a limitless black void, the
diaphanous figure of NINA, her nightdress flowing around her.

Sunday Suit.

He lifts a Hershey bar to his mouth and takes a bite of
chocolate.

A SLOW ZOOM. Closer on Joe.

Votto exits his constituency meeting accompanied by TWO SURLY
BODYGUARDS—in dark suits.

They lead him to his Car.

On Joe - his attention drifts from Votto to his bodyguards.
As one opens the rear door of Votto’s car a concealed gun
holster peeps through his jacket opening. The 2nd Man has a
grasp on Votto’s elbow as he edges him into his seat. Both
men wear earpieces.

In Joe's imagination. Williams fixes the toys on the
shelves, a doll’s house with tiny furniture, teddy bears. He
smells Nina’s pillow. Touches the material of her clothes to
his cheek. Smoothes out her bed...

On Joe as he approaches the foot of the bed. He stops and
stares. We hold on Joe’s face as his look suddenly changes.
Goldenrod Pages - 8.29.2016 73A-75.

We see Williams, slumped to the floor, his throat is slit,
blood has pooled around his lifeless body.

We cut back to Joe, the shock fades from his face and gives
way to a gamut of emotions. He laughs, he cries, he is full
of rage, he is exhausted, he falls apart. There is nothing
left of Joe.

Joe begins to mumble something indiscernible, he repeats
something, again, and again, each time it grows a little
louder and louder again.

JOE
I must do better sir, I must do
better sir, I must do better sir, I
must do better sir...

Joe repeats it, again and again, over this repetition, an
amazing high energy pop song swells to full pitch. He stops
repeating himself. He listens to the music, Joe is euphoric,
elated, light.

Eileen Barton’s If I Knew You Were Coming I'd Have Baked A

A few travellers now populate the diner...

A MIDDLE AGED MAN sat beside an oxygen tank, drawing breath
through a hand held mask - A WOMAN and her TEENAGE DAUGHTER,
schoolwork spread in front of them - AN ELDERLY COUPLE loudly
discussing an imminent hospital visit - A PAIR OF SUITS,
commuters, en route to the city.

Joe sucks the last drops of a milk shake from a metal cup.
Joe has drank it too quickly, he has a brain freeze. It is
painful, but he works through it, he then reaches for a
second milkshake from a group of three other empty milkshake
glasses.
