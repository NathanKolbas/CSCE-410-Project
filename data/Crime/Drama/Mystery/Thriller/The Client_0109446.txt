CUTS OF MEMPHIS

Elvis statues, depressed city life. It's summer. It's
hot. You could fry eggs on the sidewalk. A DJ's TWANG
FADES IN AND OUT.

CUTS OF "TUCKER WHEEL ESTATES" TRAILER PARK - MORNING

Sad. Funky. CAMERA FINDS a rusted trailer.

INT. SWAYS' TRAILER - CLOSE ON DEPARTMENT STORE PORTRAIT
of two boys (Mark and Ricky Sway) at seven and five.
RADIO DRONES.

CLOSE ON MARK SWAY

Now eleven. Street-wise. Eyes searching. An adult
female figure busily pops IN AND OUT OF FRAME. It is
DIANNE SWAY, Mark's young, fragmented mother. At twenty-
seven, she already looks somehow faded, she knows the
best part of her life is behind her.

HIS POV

Her open purse, cigarette package showing.

MARK

never takes his eyes off the purse.

DIANNE
+++ and don't let Ricky read those
scary comics... he can't sleep.

As she disappears for a second into the tiny bathroom of
their tiny trailer, Mark moves at the speed of sound and
pilfers four cigarettes from her pack. He leaps back as
she comes out of the bathroom.

DIANNE
You hear what I'm sayin'? Shoot,
I'm gonna be late for work again.

She hasn't caught him. But suddenly Mark sees who has.
RICKY his nine-year-old brother, was watching him.
usted.
EXT. TRAILER PARK - LATER

Mark walks away from the seedy park as Ricky tags along.
They climb over a fence and head into a wild wooded area.

MARK
You know the rules.

RICKY
Yeah, if I tell anyone, you'll
beat me up.

MARK
That's right.

RICKY
And I can smoke only one a day.

MARK
That's right. If I catch you
smoking more than that, then
you're in trouble. And if I
find out you're drinking beer or
messing with drugs, then --

RICKY
I know, I know. You'll beat me

up again.
MARK
Right.
RICKY
How many do you smoke a day?
MARK
Only one.
RICKY

Will one a day kill me?

MARK
Not anytime soon. One a day is
pretty safe. More than that, and
you could be in trouble.

RICKY
How many does Mom smoke a day?

MARK
Two packs.

RICKY
How many is that?
, MARK
Forty.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

RICKY
Wow. Then she’s in big trouble.

MARK
Mom's got all kinds of troubles.
I don’t think she's worried about
cigarettes.

RICKY
How many does Dad smoke a day?

MARK
Four or five packs. A hundred a
day.

RICKY
Then he's gonna die soon, right?

They move deeper and deeper into the woods, chest high
in weeds. They approach a tree with a long rope hanging
‘from a branch, and a stump situated close by.

MARK
Sit there.

Mark smiles, puts the cigarette in his mouth, flicks a
lighter before Ricky's eyes, and lights the cigarette.

MARK
Den't try to swallow the smoke.
You're not ready for that yet.
Just suck a little then blow the
smoke out.

RICKY
Okay.

Ricky eases the wet filter to his lips. His hand
shakes, and he takes a couple short drags. Success.
He smiles.

RICKY
Te's easy.
No big deal.
RICKY
Tastes kind of funny. This is
fun.

MARK
Se why are your hands shaking?
(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

RICKY
They're not.

Then Ricky hears something. A LOW, RUSHING sound comes
from a dirt road nearby.

MARK
(whispering)
Just sit still.

A shiny, brand-new LINCOLN, driven at high speed, comes
bouncing and banging down the overgrown dirt road and
ROARS into the clearing.

Both boys throw themselves flat on their bellies as
the Lincoln's ENGINE STOPS and suddenly the driver's
door kicks open. The driver steps out, into the weeds.
He is @ chubby, bearded man in a black suit, with a
wild look in his eyes. He is crying, mumbling, and
holds a bottle of whiskey.

Mark watches the man stumble to the rear of the car,
fumble with the keys, and open the trunk. He removes
@ water hose, and sticks one end inte the exhaust pipe.

RICKY
What's he doing?

Shhhh!

The man (JEROME CLIFFORD) runs the other end of the hose

through @ crack in the left rear window and crawls back
into the car.

MARK
(whispering)
Jesus Christ... He's trying to
kill himself!

RICKY
Hew de you know?
MARK
I saw this in a movie once.
RICKY
Why does he want to kill himself?
MARK
How am I supposed to know? We've
gotta do something.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

RICKY
Yeah, let's get the hell outa
here!

MARK
No! Just be still a minute.

RICKY
How long does it take?

MARK
Not very long.

Mark grabs Ricky by the shoulder.

MARK
You stay here, okay. If you move,
I'll kick your ass.

RICKY
What are you doing?

MARK
Just stay here! I mean it!

Mark begins to crawl through the weeds, towards the car.
Ricky watches Mark slither awsey from him. Mark inches
his way to the car, taking care not to create too much
movement in the weeds. He slides on his belly until he
is in the shadow of the trunk. He reaches up to the
exhaust pipe, easily dislodges the hose, and lets it
drop to the ground. Mark smiles, and retraces his trail
with a bit more speed. Ricky watches Mark make it back

to their hiding place. Mark leaps in, and crouches next
to Ricky.

RICKY
Let's go!

MARK
No, let's stay and make sure he's
okay.

There seems to be no movement coming from the car. The
ENGINE continues to IDLE.

RICKY
You think he's dead?

MARK
I don't know.

Suddenly, the door is kicked open again, and Clifford
leaps out. The boys watch him swagger.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

Clifford, crying and stumbling, stops, and sees the
dislodged water hose.

CLIFFORD
Jesus...

He bends down, and shoves the hose back into the tail
pipe, then gets back in the car.

MARK
He's crazy as hell.

RICKY
Let's get out of here.

MARK
We can't. If he kills himself,
and we saw it or knew about it,
then we could get in all ‘kinds
of trouble.

RICKY
Then we won't tell anyone!

Just stay down. We're not leaving
until I say we're leaving!

Ricky closes his eyes, and tries not to start crying.
Mark is on his hands and knees again, deep in the weeds
and heading towards the car.

RICKY
(crying)
Just let him die, Mark.

INT. JEROME CLIFFORD'S BLACK LINCOLN CONTINENTAL

Clifford inhales and exhales strongly. His nostrils
flare. Tears stream from his eyes. A half-empty bottle
of Jack Daniela is clutched in his loose hand. A pistol
lies on the seat next to him, pills scattered everywhere.
Clifferd sighs. He takes the bottle, unscrews the cap,
and gulps, glancing in the rearview mirror.

HIS POV - THROUGH MIRROR
The weeds move behind his car.

EXT. UNDERNEATH BLACK LINCOLN

Mark Ties in the shadow of the black Lincoln, and is
about to dislodge the hose from the tail pipe again, when
suddenly he is grabbed by the strong clutches of Jerome
Clifford.

CLIFFORD
You! You little bastard.

Mark SCREAMS. Ricky freaks.

Cliford grabs Mark by the hair, and flings him onto the
trunk of the car. Mark kicks and squirms, and Clfford
slaps him with a fat hand. Clifford's wild, glowing face
is just inches away. His eyes are red and wet.

CLIFFORD
You little bastard.

Mark is yanked off the trunk by his collar. Clifford
drags him around the cart, through the weeds to the
driver's open door, and throws him inside. Ricky is
shaking.

INT. CLIFFORD'S BLACK LINCOLN

Mark is hurled across the black leather seat. Terrified,
he lunges at the door handle and searches for a door lock
switch when Clifford falls behind the steering wheel,
closes the door, and pushes the lock button.

 

Mark is frozen, trying to orientate himself. Both of
them pant, the air thickening with fumes.

CLIFFORD
I think we should die together.

MARK
Please let me out of here!
Clifford swigs the whiskey.

CLIFFORD
Sorry, kid. You had to be a cute
ass, had to stick your dirty
little nose into my business,
didn't you? So I think we should
die together. Okay? Just you
and me, pel. Off to la la land.
Sweet dreams.

Mark notices the pistol sitting between then.

Clifford picks up the pistol, and aims it dead on at
Mark.

do, I'll kill you. I'm crazy as

: MARK

brother.

CLIFFORD
j aw, ain't that sweet. A real man

! Clifford shivers, and inhales the poison air deeply.

CLIFFORD
You have a choice, kid. I'11 blow
your brains out, and it's over
now, or the gas'll get you. Your
choice.

Mark looks out the cloudy windshield.

MARK
Why are you doing this?

CLIFFORD
‘Cause! I've been driven crazy.
You see, my beloved buddy in
death, we lawyers hear all sorts
of private stuff that we can never
repeat.

EXT. WOODS

Ricky looks at the big car. Tears stream down his face.
He is terrified.

Romey sets the gun down on the seat while he pops a few
more pills and gulps liquor.

CLIFFORD

He laughs, coughs. Mark waits for his chance to grab the
gun.

Whose body?

EXT. wOODS

Ricky looks around, takes a breath, and then lowers
himself to the ground. He begins to creep his way
towards the car. He is shaking and crying.

IN TALL WEEDS

Mark and Ricky duck low and hide.

Clifford is mumbling loudly as he staggers to the rear of
the car, and sees the garden hose lying harmlessly in the
grass.

Mark and Ricky watch with fear as his feet come near.
Clifford swaggers like a slain minotaur.

CLIFFORD
Goddamn kid!

Clifford then takes the gun, and routinely sticks it deep
in his mouth, clenching it between his teeth.

Mark and Ricky freak as they hear a GUN BLAST.
Clifford almost falls on top of them. Ricky screaming.

with the bullet hole in his head, looms in front of him.
His voice is slow and strange but his message is clear.

INT. RICKY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Mark wakes from the nightmare. He's on a small mattress
at the foot of the bed where Dianne sleeps with Ricky.,
.Mark looks around. He feels uneasy. The door seems

opened strangely. He sees a shadow in the hall. Mark
gets up and cautiously steps into the

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

It's empty. Everyone’s asleep. He heads toward a blonde
head at the nurses’ station, only to find it to be a
much older NURSE.

MARK
No... got anything to eat around
here?

NURSE
Cafeteria's open 24 hours.

Mark walks away from the counter, and passes the empty
TV area. As he passes a table, he sees a bunch of newly
delivered morning newspapers sitting there.

As Mark gets closer, his eyes widen.

On the front page of the morning Paper are two pictures,
taken by Slick Moeller. One picture is of Ricky, asleep

in a coma, the other Picture is of Mark, angrily yelling
at Slick to get out of the room. .

Mark sees that their names are printed below the pic-
tures, and there is a detailed story about the FBI
wanting to question the boys.

Mark picks up a newspaper, and begins to read the article
with disbelief. He walks down the hall towards the
elevators.

Mark reaches the elevators, and pushes the butten, still
reading the newspaper. It looks as if he is trying not
to cry.

MARK

Oh, my gosh.

The elevator doors open, and Mark steps inside.

Mark pushes the button for the cafeteria level, when
suddenly...

+++ 8M arm catches the doors and a man steps inside the
elevator with Mark. Mark looks up, and sees that it is
a big man, dressed in a surgeon's robe and mask.

The man looks down at Mark, and we know it is Paul
Gronke. .

Mark looks down the arm of the man and sees that he is
holding a glinting scalpel knife in his rubber-gloved
hand.

The doors close. The elevator begins to move downward,
Suddenly, Gronke pushes the stop button and turns off the
elevator lights, stopping the elevator between floors.
The emergency light illuminates everything in red.

In a flash, Gronke grabs Mark by the throat and pushes
him against the wall. Mark is frozen with fear.

GRONKE
Listen to me, 'Mark Sway.’

Mark's eyes are wide with fear.

GRONKE
I'll kill you, do you believe
me? And if you tell anyone about

I've seen the trailer where you

Gronke takes a picture out of his coat pocket, and holds
it in front of Mark's face.

GRONKE
Seen this before?

It is the department store portrait of Mark and Ricky,
obviously stolen from the Sway trailer.

Mark shuts his eyes, knowing what this means.

FINK
There are two avenues, neither
very attractive, but one or both
might work. First, I Suggest the
Juvenile Court approach in
Memphis. Under the Tennessee
Youth Code, we petition the
Juvenile Court alleging certain
misconduct by the child. There
are various categories of
wrongdoing, and the Petition must
classify the child as a delinquent
or a child in need of supervision.
A hearing is held, the Juvenile
Court Judge hears the Proof and
makes a determination as to what
happens to the child. The Same
can be done for abused or
neglected children. Same
Procedure, same court.

FOLTRIGG
Who files the petition?

FINK
Well, anyone. ‘An interested
party.’

TRIGG
That can be us?

FINK
Yes. It depends on what we allege
in our petition. The tricky part
is we aust allege the kid is
breaking the law in some way.

FOLTRIGG
The kid knows where the body is.
It's an obstruction of Justice.

FINK
The good news is thet all Juvenile
Court Proceedings are closed. If
our plan doesn't bear fruit, it
won't embarrass us.

FOLTRIGG
Sounds good to me. File a
petition in Juvenile Court first

Now, if we're gonna play hardball
with this kid, let's not forget
the danger he’s in. Muldanne is
desperate. There are reporters
everywhere. A leak here and a
leak there, and the Mob could
silence the kid before he talks.

FINK
Well, that brings us.to our second
option. We know Gronke is in
Memphis, and it's safe to assume
he's not there to visit Elivs’
grave, right? He's been sent
there by Muldanno. So I was
thinking, what if we assume the
kid is in danger, and we explain
to the Juvenile Court Judge that
it's in the best interest of the
kid for us to take him into
custody, you know, for his own
protection?

FOLTRIGG
: The kid goes to jail, and with Ms.
Love's alcohel and drug problems,
they both crack under the pressure.

Speaks to Mark quietly, _

REGGIE
There's a thing called the Federal
Witness Program. What that means
is that if people see something
that could put them in danger if
they told about it, the government
can protect them.

Yeah -- I saw that on TV once.

Totally safe? .
REGGIE

Well, nothing's hotally safe, I
guess.

MARK

Great.

REGGIE

Well, it's Something for you to
think about. See if you can get
your mother to talk about it with
you.

me to say?

REGGIE

Mark, they'll ask you these
questions over and over, trying
to confuse you, to make you mad,
so you'll slip and say something.

MARK
Well, I don't give a damn. I'm
tized of answering questions

He gets up, walks to the TELEVISION, flicks it on and off

Grows irritable.

Well, it's not a logical question, but Mark's eleven

and he's weary. He stands looking out a window. Reggie,
calmer now, looks at Mark. Her face softens. She finds
herself responding to this boy, and so she says something
to him that is totally atypical of herself.

REGGIE
So you ask me something.

MARK

It's clear Reggie means what she says. Mark looks at
her, fascinated. He thinks for beat or two and then,
with the unerring accuracy of a child, goes to the
very heart of Reggie's life:

: MARK
Who're those little girls with you
_ in that picture? The one on your
desk in your mother's living room?

Reggie's face jerks and she answers the question:

REGGIE
They're my daughters. They're
older than you now. There was «
divorce, and they live with their

- father.
MARK
Do you ever see them?
REGGIE

Not much. He's managed to turn
them against me -- and it's partly
my fault too -- for a while I
wasn't a very good mother.

MARK
"Cause you was drunk and on drugs

of this case, the child should
take the stand and testify.

Harry rips off his glasses.

Your Honor, the child is the only
witness. He is the last person
to see Jerome Clifford alive.
We've established Jerome Clifford
as a source of vital information
concerning the disappearance of
Senator Boyd Boyette in our
petition. We've established the
child lied about his involvement
with Clifford's death. We are
asking that the child testify.
We are not forcing the child to
testify. Not at this time,
anyway. -

Harry looks at Reggie.
HARRY
Ms. Love, will you ‘allow’ your
client to testify?

Reggie pauses, then looks at Mark, who sits silent,
confused,

REGGIE
That's up to my client.

Foltrigg and Harry watch Reggie confer with her client.

REGGIE
My client will testify, but I will
not tolerate abusive questioning
by Mr. Fink.

Quiet, Mr. Fink. Remember rule

Step outside and talk to Reggie,
Ms. Love, just let me know, okay?

MARK
Yes sir.

Fink turns in his chair, and faces Mark like a hungry
Puppy.

FINK
Now, Mark, I want you to explain
to me exactly how you and your
brother discovered Mr. Clifford
on Monday.

MARK
We sneaked off into the woods
behind the trailer park, to smoke
& cigarette.

FINK
What'd you do then?

MARK
The car pulled up, we hid. The
man tried to kill himself with a
hose in the tail pipe. I pulled
it out, he found me.

FINK
Were you forced into the car with
Mr. Clifford before he died?

FINK
What did he say?

MARK
He was out of his mind, kept
talking about floating off to
“La Land, then he would yell
at me for crying, then he would
apologize for hitting me.

FINK
That’s «11 he said?
MARK
What do you mean?
FINK
Did Mr. Clifford say anything

Mark doesn't say anything.

FINK
Yes, but not in this sitution.
You're not implicated in the death

want you to know, that I will not
let you take me or anyone else in
the family down with you. Do you
understand? You may force me to
take action as well. Ironic, isn't
it? You and the boy both have
something in common. You both
know too much.

MULDANNO
I’m begging you, Uncle Johnny.
Just help me now, and I'll never
make another mistake again.

The headlights illuminate a mailbox with the numbers
"1216" and, in smaller letters, "CLIFFORD,"

MARK
Can you see the boathouse?

REGGIE
No boathouse.

Mark can't take his eyes off of Jerome Clifford's
property. .

MARK
Romey told me that Barry the
Blade hid the Senator's body
‘under his boat' in his boathouse.

REGGIE
On his own property, how insane.

MARK
Romey said Barry the Blade was in
a hurry. He took the body to his
house, and buried it in concrete

under the boat.

REGGIE
I can't see a boathouse.

Mark cpens his door.

MARK
Well, let's go and see.
Reggie quickly leans over Mark, and shuts the doer.

REGGIE
Don’t be crazy! Who knows who
could see us! We have to be
careful. There's a lake and some
woods -- let's park back there.

EXT. DOCKS (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT
Barry the Blade, Bono, and Gronke walk towards a car that

sits alone on a dock. The men are carrying shovels and
pick axes. Gronke is sneezing.

They get into the car, START the ENGINE, and spin off
onto the street.
EXT. WOODS BEHIND JEROME CLIFFORD'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Through the thick, swampy woods creep Reggie and Mark.
The woods are next to the river.

REGGIE
It's so dark, I can barely see.

They reach a group cf trees that line the back yards of
the cluster of homes that include Clifford's house.

Mark and Reggie crouch down.
REGGIE
That's Clifford's house, down
there.
With his eys, Mark follows the line of Clifford's

Property, and sees that it leads down to the river.
Situated on the river is a ruatic-looking boathouse.

MARK
Reggie look! That's Romey's
boathouse!

Reggie squints, and surveys the boathouse.

REGGIE
Yeah.
MARK
It's gotta be. Let's go.
REGGIE

Careful, Mark! We don't want to
be arrested for trespassing!

Between Mark and Reggie's vantage point and Romey's boat-
house lies another piece of property, a home belonging to
a Mr. Ballentine. In order to get to Romey's boathouse,
they must run across Ballentine’s property. There are
"NO TRESPASSING - ARMED RESPONSE" signs posted about.

Reggie and Mark scamper across the back lawn of the
Ballentines' residence. In the lighted windows of the
house, Mark can see MR. BALLENTINE, s fat old man,
pouring himself a glass of chocolate milk in his kitchen.

. REGGIE
For God's sake, let's not set off
any alarms.

(CONTINUED )
122.
CONTINUED:
Mark and Reggie try to creep behind shrubs and trees,
past Ballentine’s house, until they reach Clifford's
property and the boathouse.

Mark silently dashes down towards the boathouse. Reggie
tries to keep up with him.

REGGIE
(whispering
desperately)
Mark! Mark, hold on!
She catches up to him, and holds him back.

REGGIE
Mark!
Come on, Reggie! .
Reggie gets a good look at the boathouse. It's old, big,
foreboding. She can see a big lock on the doors. :

REGGIE
It's locked! Jesus, just slow
down, and let's think sbout this.

MARK
We can break the lock!
REGGIE
We can't wake up half the
neighborhood!

Mark walks up to the boathouse, and pulls at the lock, he
tries the doors. They won't budge.

Reggie tries a smaller side-door. Also padlocked. They
whisper.

REGGIE
Now what?

Mark glances up, sees a high window open so that only a
child could crawl in. He points to a spot under the
window.
MARK

Stand over there and make a step.
Mark laces his fingers together, palma up.

. MARK

Make a gtep. I'm gonna climb on

your shoulders.
(CONTINUED )
123.

CONTINUED:

Reggie's face says, "Oh, Jesus,” but she does it. Mark
drops the flashlight inside his shirt, puts a foot in her
palms, then manages to clamber up onto her shoulders.
Reggie staggers a bit but is able to hold his weight.
Mark works with the WINDOW, grunts a bit, and yes, the
thing gives way and pulls wide, making a LOUD CREAKING
noise as it swings open.

Immediately, Mark is climbing inside.

REGGIE
Mark, wait...

But he’s inside. Reggie flattens herself against the
wall, looking hard at the neighbor's house surrounded
by chain-link fence and alarm system signs. Silence.

INT. BOATHOUSE

The structure is surprisingly big. Mark dangles from «
three-inch wide rafter that runs across the boathouse,
then drops down onto a gravel floor. The full moon
shines through the window, giving us some light. Mark
switches the flashlight on low and we see...

Spiderwebs everywhere, covering rusted patio furniture,
stacks of newpapers and, oddly, huge bunches of wire
coathangers bound together. The boat itself -- a large,
sixteen: foot outboard ski rig sits in the exact middle of
the space.

Layers of junk are piled against the boat: Sacks of
aluminum cans, garden tools, old tires, etc. Being as
quiet as he can, Mark lifts a tire away from the boat.

EXT. BOATHOUSE - SAME TIME.

Reggie stiffens as she hears MALE VOICES. Where are the
voices coming from? Where's the source? And suddenly
she sees three shadows, and oh, Christ, they're walking
straight down the driveway toward the boathouse.

INT. BOATHOUSE - SAME TIME

Mark is on the floor, which is slanted down and leads to
the murky water. The boathouse is dark and eerie.

He crouches under the boat, and examines the concrete.
which was poured hastily, and looks like something could
be underneath.
124.
EXT. BOATHOUSE
Reggie freaking.

REGGIE
(frantic whisper)
Mark! Mark! Somebody's coming.

The shadows are closer. What can she do? She gives one
rap on the wall -- as hard as she dares -- and fades back
inte the weeds.

INT. BOATHOUSE
Mark freaking.

EXT. FRONT OF BOATHOUSE

Closer to us, we see that the shadows are Barry, Gronke
_and Bono carrying hammers and chisels. They also speak
in whispers. .

BONO
You got a key?

Barry, his face strained, SHOOTS the lock TWICE with his
SILENCER PISTOL, a SOFT THUNK, THUNK, and the padlock
falls away. The three men stop as a MUTED CLATTER comes
from within the boathouse.

INT. BOATHOUSE

Mark leaps onto the side of the boat. He lifts himself
ue and over the side of the boat, and hides under a sheet
of canvas.

EXT. BOATHOUSE - ANGLE ON REGGIE

who is rigid, absolutely frozen as she watches the three
men draw guns and enter the boathouse, clesing the door
behind thea.

INT. BOATHOUSE - SAME TIME

Moonlight still streams through the window, and the two
thugs have produced flashlights with which they search
the interior of the boathouse. Everything looks exactly
as it had before: The tire and the sack of cans lean
against the boat precisely as they did before Mark
touched anything.

(CONTINUED)
125.
CONTINUED:

BARRY
I know I heard something.

GRONKE
Maybe a cat?

Barry doesn't answer him. He flashes the light around the
boathouse one more time, but sees nothing and moves to
the boat. The three men quickly push away the junk and
roll the boat off its spot. Barry scrapes away two
inches of gravel with a shovel quickly hitting the
concrete. He puts down the shovel and he and both of

the other men picks up hammers and chisels and begin

to CHINK away. As the three work --

INT. BOAT

Mark lowers himself down into the darkness of the boat
even some more. in the shadows, he looks around. He
looks down towards the boat's stern. He can see, through
the edge of the canvas sheet boat cover, that the large
doors to the boathouse have been left open by the thugs.

Mark thinks, and begins to creep his way under the canvas
to his escape route. One sound and he's dead.

Mark has reached the edge of the boat, and lifts the
canvas up. He is about two feet from the open doors.
It is very dark, and the men have al] their flashlight
beams aimed down at the. cement.

Mark carefully climbs out over the end of the boat, and
uses the motor and propeller as a means of lowering
himself down onto the ground, quietly.

EXT. BOATHOUSE - SAME TIME

Reggie crouches where we saw her before. She's in a
classic double bind: She's frightened, wants to run,
yet she's even more concerned about Mark. Se she's
caught there.

INT. BOATHOUSE

The men continue to pick away at the cement.

Mark runs out the doors of the boathouse.

EXT. BOATHOUSE - SAME TIME

Mark scurries silently into the yard.

From behind the bush, Reggie frantically waves to him.
Mark sees her, and runs over.
They hug, both scared to the marrow of their bones.

REGGIE
Mark! We're getting the hell
outta here!

MARK
We can't! They're gonna take the
body.

. REGGIE
But, Mark, they're killers! These
are Mafia people! We've got to
get outta here and think of
something else to do!

MARK
If we let them take the body,
we're dead! —

REGGIE
Tf we stay, we're dead. Let's go.
They beat us. It's all over.

They win.

MARK
Quitter!!!

REGGIE
Mark...

MARK
No wonder your kids left you...
You're a quitter!!!

This is the worst thing anyone could ever say to her.
Her silent rage is so staggering that even Mark is
scared. Reggie picks up a large rock.

Mark is perplexed, not knowing what she could possibly
lo.

Reggie holds the rock up in the air. Then suddenly, she
swinga the rock with all her might into the air, and it
sails through the night.

Mark and Reggie watch the rock hurl towards the
Ballentines’ house, towards « large bay window.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

The rock SMASHES through the WINDOW of the elegant house,
and all of a sudden ail hell breaks loose. The ALARM
SYSTEM goes bananas. Lights flash on, ALARMS BLARE.

Mark and Reggie hit the ground, in shock. Mark grabs
Reggie tight. They hide in the shadows, behind a clump
of weeds.

INT. CLIFFORD'S BOATHOUSE - SAME TIME
The three goons stop their work.

BONO
What in Christ's name is going on?

The three men look at each other in panic, and suddenly
throw all their tools up over into the boat, and cover
them with the canvas. They take some trash, and spill
it over the hole in the cement, hiding it.

Bono and Gronke run up to the door, brandishing their
pistols, and lock out into the yard. The sound of the
ALARM is almost DEAFENING.

EXT. BALLANTINE HOUSE - SAME TIME

In his underwear, fat old Mr. Ballantine comes running
out of his house with a shotgun.

BALLENTINE
You sons of bitches! Where the
hell are you? Come here, man to

Ballentine can see figures running around on Clifford's
residence.

BALLENTINE
Sons of bitches!

Ballentine FIRES a BLAST blindly over towards the three
goons.

Barry, Bono, and Gronke hit the dust, and scramble to
take cover. They fan out, running in all directions.

BALLENTINE
I's sees ya! You snakes!

He FIRES another LOAD into the darkness.

BONO
Jesus!

Bono scrambles in the shadows, and runs precariously near
Reggie and Mark's hiding place.

Reggie and Mark see him, crouch down, barely escaping
being caught.

Ballentine SHOOTS again.

Barry sees Ballentine, and from across the yard, begins
to SHOOT a ROUND from his PISTOL.

A bullet barely misses Ballentine's head, and Ballentine
screams. He ducks back through the sliding doors of his:
kitchen, where his wife is screaming.

Bono takes this opportunity to run back into Clifford's
yard, and runs back up to the driveway.

Reggie and Mark can hear their CAR START UP, and SWERVE
away, inte the street, and take off.

They are alone once more. The ALARM is still BLARING.
Reggie and Mark lock at each other, breathing heavily
from the excitement.
Mark begins to smile.

MARK CL

Mark clears the last bit of trash away, and holds the
flashlight close to the black plastic.

Mark and Reggie look at each other.

MARK
Should 1?

Reggie doesn't say anything.

Mark reaches down, and grabs the black plastic. He
begins to stretch it away from the cement, until it rips.

Mark bolts upright in horror, and is staring squarely
into the face of the late Senator Boyd Boyatte.

The two of them look at the dead man, who looks like
he is in pain, and is screaming out for help.

Reggie begins to fall backwards. Mark catches her.

: REGGIE
I... I'm sorry.

They hear POLICE SIRENS.

MARK
Quick.

They cover the body quickly and make a fast getaway.

Foltrigg and Trumann rush into the shop. The place is

His lips quiver and tears run down his chin. Reggie
