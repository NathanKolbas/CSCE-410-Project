FADE IN:
EXT, OPEN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A dusty, four-year-old car speeds along in the shadows of overhanging
trees, moonlight splashing through to the pavement.

INT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT

The driver is PAUL BIEGLER, His fingers tap time against the
steering wheel to MUSIC from the radio, In the glow from the
dashboard we see a pleasant looking man in his early forties -- wry,
humorous mouth, lean jaws, friendly eyes. He wears an old hunting
jacket, shirt open at the throat. Several angling lures are hooked
into the felt of his battered hat,

EXT...

 

NN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

 

The car approaches. PAN it by as it hurries toward the distant lights
of a small town. On the shoulder of the road a modest spotlighted
sign reads:

THE C OF C WELCOMES YOU TO
IRON CITY, MICH.
WE'RE A LIVELY TOWN

EXT, MAIN STREET OF IRON CITY - FULL. SHOT - NIGHT

The sidewalks are rolled up. A single auto is parked in front of a
bar identified by a blue neon sign -- TRIPOLI BAR, A traffic light
at an intersection futilely changes color -- kept company only by a
lonesome night marshal standing on the corner, From down the
street comes Paul's car,

DOOROF TRIPOLI: BAR -*:.NIGHT .

The white-aproned BARTENDER leans against the door jamb, watching
the approaching car. Inside the bar, a man and woman are hunched
over a table -- and at the bar stands.a solitary drinker -- an elderly
man,. hat cocked on the back of his head, interest absorbed by a bottle
on the bar. This is PARNELL, Paul's car rolls past the bar.. Paul
waves, calls out, ''Hi, Toivo.'"' The bartender answers Paul with a
wave.

TOIVO
. {over his shoulder)
Hey, Mr. McCarthy, your pal just
drove into town,
 

 

 

a
INT, TRIPOLI BAR - NIGHT

Toivo turns from the door, comes behind the bar. Parnell pours
himself another drink from the bottle on the bar.

PARNELL
Just one more, Toivo,

Parnell is an erect, not quite drunk gentleman in his sixties, His hat
was once an expensive velvet Homburg. His jacket is good tweed but
worn and baggy. He wears a Tattersall vest of brilliant colors which
seems wonderfully right on Parnell -- a reflection of a young heart
and love of life. As Parnell tosses the drink off, Toive watches him
with a gentle compassion, Parnell now fumbles in his various pockets
for some money.

PARNELL
(continues)
Toivo, I'm afraid I'm going to have to
pay my bar bill tomorrow.

Too... 2
You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy,-- —-—... -—-_.

PARNELL
Thank you, Toivo. ,

He straightens his old Homburg hat, smooths out the Tattersall vest
and heads for the door.

PARNELL
(continues)
Good night, Toivo.
TOIVO
Good night, Mr. McCarthy.

EXT, PAUL'S HOME AND OFFICE - NIGHT

Qn the main street -- the lights of the business district in the distance,

Paul's car approaches the old, two-storied house -= swings into the
driveway. In CLOSE SHOT the headlights catch his shingle fastened
to.a support post on the front porch, It reads: PAUL BIEGLER -
‘ATTY, AT LAW, The headlights go out. Paul climbs from the car,
bringing with him a collapsed fly rod, a knapsack and a trout basket,
In the darkness he comes up the steps, fumbles into the mail box for
the door key, opens the door, flips the light switch inside.

INT. HALLWAY - PAUL'S HOME AND OFFICE - NIGHT
Lighted by a shaded bulb hanging from the ceiling, the sparsely
furnished foyer ~~ an umbrella stand by the door and a limp,
artificial potted plant. A flight of stairs rises to the second floor.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

The hallway runs past the stairs to the rear of the house. In the
f.g. a piece of white note paper is speared on one of the points of a
deer's antlers, which, attached to the wall, serve as a hat rack.

In the b. g. Paul has entered, closed the door behind him with a
practiced kick. He comes to the antlers, cocks his head sideways
to read the note. His lips move a little as he reads.

INT. PAUL'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

A darkened interior, At an angle we look through an open door which
leads into the dark outer office. In the outer office another open door
leads into the lighted hallway. Paul is seen in the hallway reading
the note on the antlers. Not disturbing the note, he enters the outer
office, passes through into the private office. He turns on a standing
lamp. Illuminated, this office is quite a large room -- was once.a
dining room. The walls are lined with law books. There isa
cluttered, roll-top desk and swivel desk chair, Grouped about the
desk are several other assorted chairs. Against one wall is an
ancient black leather couch and on a small safe in a corner a portable
record player with a well-stocked album rack. Near the safe is an old
upright piano against the wall, the panel missing, revealing its
musical works. The round dining table, left over from times past,

is stacked with law books and legal journals. Paul deposits his
fishing gear on the table, lifts a brown paper sack from his coat ,
pocket, stands it on the table. The sack contains the shape of a
bottle. He opens a closet door, and on the inside of the door is fixed
a canvas panel on which are fastened myriad trout lures. Paul
removes the lures from his hat, hooks them into the canvas, The
last is a brightly colored Royal Coachman. He affectionately blows
on its pretty feathers before fastening it to the panel. Now he tosses
his hat into the closet, closes the door, gets his trout basket,
brushes through a swinging door into the kitchen,

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

_As.he enters, he lights the room. There are no built-in modern.
‘cabinets here. This kitchen,..like the rest of the house, belongs to

another period. There is an antique kitchen cabinet, a sink with
wooden drainboar d and brass fixtures, a sanded kitchen table anda
kerosene stove of early vintage. “Alone in'modern splendor is a big,
upright freezer. Paul takes a half-dozen trout from his basket,

plops them on the table. He removes his hunting jacket, takes a

knife from a drawer, sets about cleaning the fish. Now he remembers
the note on the antlers. Wiping his hands on a towel, he goes through
another door in the kitchen which leads into the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Paul comes from the back of the hallway to the antlers, picks off
the note and goes again into the outer office.

INT. PAUL'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

He enters from the outer office, takes the telephone, glances at
the note, dials the operator. The operator responds, her voice
remote, mechanical.

PAUL
(into phone)
Operator, I want 489 in Thunder Bay,
(reading note)
I want to speak to a Mrs. Manion,
M-A-N-I-O-N Manion, This is
Paul Biegler speaking. Iron City 700.

EXT, THUNDER BAY TOURIST PARK - NIGHT

On the outside of a small, darkened hut a dimly illuminated sign
reads: THUNDER BAY PARK - OFFICE. Beyond and scattered
along a narrow road are the shapes of darkened house trailers --
autos parked beside therm. At the end of the road a wide lake
shimmers in the moonlight. In the hut.a telephone TINKLES faintly.
-& light goes on in the hut and through the window we see an elderly
man come from a back room wearing his bathrobe. This is Mr.
LEMON, the park caretaker and deputy sheriff. He answers the phone
on the wall -- listens -- replies -- leaves the phone dangling, comes
outside the hut -- flashlight in hand -- hurries away to disappear
among the trailers.

ANOTHER PART OF TOURIST PARK - NIGHT

Lemon comes through trees, flashlight beam leading the way,
approaching a trailer in the f.g. The trailer has a striped awning
over the front door, a couple of canvas chairs outside the stoop.
Light shines through the broad picture window on the front end of
the trailer, The CAMERA LOOKS through the picture window into
the living room of the trailer. A folding table is littered with cheap
magazines, a half empty bottle of whiskey, and several glasses. A
bra. hangs on the back.of the chair and.an army officer's cap and
acket are hooked ‘to’a nail in the wall. ‘A woman's negligee hangs
from a corner of an open closet door, and on the floor, below the
negligee, are a pair of blue-puffed bed slippers. Beyond the living
room is the passage way which also serves as a kitchen. At the end
of the passage way we glimpse an unmade bed. The effectis not of
squalor -- but rather of sensual carelessness. Mr. Lemon has
reached the trailer and we hear him rap on the door several times.
Now the door opens and Lemon thrusts his head into the trailer.

He calls, "Mrs. Manion?" Satisfied she is not there he closes the
door. .

  
 

INT, PAUL'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Paul with the phone, waiting for the call to come through. He
glances out the window.

EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Parnell is crossing the street toward Paul's house. He passes
under a street lamp, teeters a little on the curb as he steps up.

INT. PAUL'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Paul, seeing Parnell, grins and lowers the blind. The operator's
muffled voice brings him to attention.

PAUL
(into phone)
Hello? -- yes -- well, do they know
when she'll be there? .... Isee.....
alright, leave a message for her to
call this number, Thanks.

He hangs up, thoughtfully folds the note and puts it in his shirt
pocket, returns to the kitchen, leaving the door open. From the
front of the house comes the sound of a door opening and closing
and Parnell comes from the outer office into Paul's private office.

PAUL
(in the kitchen)
What do you say there, counselor?

PARNELL
(sees the brown paper bag)
What's in the brown paper bag?

PAUL
It could be a cabbage head.

PARNELL
But it wouldn't be.

PAUL
You're a suspicious man.

PARNELL
True. I'm everlastingly suspicious
of and/or fascinated by the contents
of brown paper bags. Shall I sneak

a peek?
PAUL
You do that -- and uncork whatever
you find, .

Parnell peers into the paper bag. Paul enters with two glasses
and a pitcher of water.

PARNELL
Shall I pour?

(CONTINUED)

 
17

CONTINUED:

PAUL
Your privilege.

PARNELL
(pouring)
My pleasure, sir.

They drink, Paul goes to the piano, sits and begins to fool around
with some passages of jazz, Parnell sizes up the contents of the
bottle, which is half-empty.

PARNELL
You fought this soldier by yourself.
You've been drinking alone. I don't
like that, Polly.

PAUL
Drop the stone, counselor, You
live in a glass house,

PARNELL
My windows were busted a long time
ago so I can say as I please,
When a man starts drinking alone
he digs a hole for himself. Me --
I'm almost through to China.

PAUL
Want an Italian cigar?

PARNSLL
No thanks. Those stink weeds are
another sign of your decadence,

Paul lights a cigar and returns to his play with the piano keys.
Parnell pours himself another drink.

PARNELL
{tossing the drink off).

Polly, it's a fact. Since Mitch
Lodwick beat you out of the office
of prosecuting attorney you haven't
been worth salt for peanuts... Not
that I don't understand how you
feel. Man gets beat for an office
he's held a long time, he feels

his community has deserted him --
the finger of scorn is pointed....

PAUL
None but the lonely heart shall know
my anguish,

(CONTINUED)

O PARNELL
It's been a full year since you were
skinned at the polls, How long are
you going to skulk like this?

PAUL
What the hell are you talking about?

PARNELL
Man, you're an honest-to-God lawyer.
You ought to make like one -- be here
-- ready for clients -- not fishing or
playing that rootity toot jazz --

PAUL
Go ahead, Parn, Have another drink,
Don't stand on ceremony.

 

PARNELL
If it means keeping our friendship I
guess I can take another wee drop.

He pours a shot and downs it,

. PAUL

CO I'm making a living. I run some
abstracts -- divorce Jane Doe from
Jobn Doe once in a while == or threaten
a few dead beats -- and in the evening
I drink rye whiskey and read law with
Parnell Emmett McCarthy -- one of
the world's great men.

There's a little silence,

PARNELL

That was a kind word, Polly.
vo aes Sa pause)
You know -- I might have been. That's.
one reason I hate to see your talent
pushed aside by lesser men. I look
at you and see myself -- thirty years
ago ~~ with the same love for the
smell of the old brown books in a
dusty office,

(he takes-a

book from

a shelf)
Now here's a rose, a lily, a sweet
lupine -- the United States Supreme
Court Reports!

e Parnell takes out his specs, sits at the table.
(CONTINUED)

 

 
17 CONTINUED: (3)

PARNELL
(continues)
Well, what shall we read this evening?
How about a little Chief Justice Holmes
-- maybe a few dissenting opinions.

The phone RINGS,

PAUL
Restrain Chief Justice Holmes for a
minute. I think I have a client -- at
least I've been waiting for a call,
(into phone)
Hello? ... Yes, this is Biegler
speaking... Hello? ... Mrs. Manion?

Parnell snaps his specs off his nose =~ moves in close to Paul.

PAUL
(continues;
into phone)
Itried to reach you a while ago... did
you get my message? :

PARNELL
(whispering)
Who is that? What was that name?

PAUL

(seeing Parnell's

excitement)
Just a minute -- this seems to be a
bad connection == hold on, will you,
please?

(he covers

mouthpiece)
A woman named Manion -- Maida took
a message from her,

: PARNELL
In Thunder Bay?

PAUL
Yes.

PARNELL
She wants you to represent her husband,
Say yes.

PAUL
I don't even know what it's about.

PARNELL
Pretend you know and say yes.

Paul, doubtful but trusting Parnell, opens the mouthpiece of the phone.

PAUL
Hello? -- Yes, that's better. I can
hear you now,

18 INT, PHONE BOOTH - THUNDER BAY AMUSEMENT ARCADE -
NIGHT

LAURA MANION is on the phone. Her face is obscured by dark
glasses. She wears a trench coat -- the collar turned up a little.
On the directory shelf sits a small, fuzzy dog watching his mistress
as she talks. Outside the booth is a busy gaming arcade -- pinball
machines, grab cages -~ populated by tourists in Bermuda shorts --
and soldiers and their girl friends -- and outside the open front of
the arcade lies the lake.

Parnell, excited, is pouring himself the last drink from the bottle.

PARNELL
A man named Barney Quill raped Mrs,
Manion, Her husband -- he's a
lieutenant in the army -~ there's a
temporary base in Thunder Bay,
gunnery or something like that --
the Lieutenant goes to Quill's place
and plugs Mr, Quill about five times
which causes Mr, Quill to Promptly
die of lead poisoning.

PAUL

EXT. PAUL'S HOME - MORNING

Acar, same age as Paul's machine, rambles to a halt in front of the
house. MAIDA - Paul's secretary ~ has arrived for work, She's
middle-aged, seems rather dour, but her mouth has a suspiciously
comic twist -- and if she appears to be cynical, a closer look at her
eyes will give away her good heart. She wears, everlastingly, a small
flowered hat -- the badge of respectability among middle-aged, middle
western American women. At the stoop she picks up the bottle of

milk and casts about among the bushes for the morning paper --
mumbling as she searches, 'Where'd he ‘throw it this time?" She can't
find the paper, goes on in the house, collecting the mail en route.

INT, OUTER OFFICE - DAY

The outer office, seen in daylight, is Maida's office. Here are
filing cabinets, her desk and typewriter and a beat-up sofa for
waiting clients. She drops the mail on her desk, passes into Paul's
private office.

INT. PAUL'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

The window shades are drawn -- the lamp still burns. Parnell is
stretched out on the couch, hat over his face -- a couple of beer
bottles on the floor beside him, Maida opens the blinds, turns out
the lamp, glowers at Parnell and pushes through the swinging door
into the kitchen.

INT, KITCHEN - DAY

Paul is at the table -- dressed, shaved, and nervously drinking
coffee as.he reads the newspaper. ...._...

PAUL
Morning, Maida.

MAIDA
Oh, there itis.

PAUL
What?

MAIDA
The newspaper. I thought maybe
they didn't bring it. We haven't
paid the bill.

She uncaps the milk bottle, pours a little into Paul's coffee as she
looks over his shoulder to see what he is reading.

: : MAIDA
You get my note?

PAUL
Yes, We might be in the case.
I'm reading up on it now before
I talk to Lieutenant Manion.

She puts some bread in the toaster.

MAIDA
Doesn't he ever go home ?

PAUL -
Parnell? Well, we were up late

last night. :

MAIDA
(flatly)
Is that a fact?
PAUL

I think you'd better cancel any
appointments for the day.

MAIDA
What appointments? People think
you've migrated to the woods,

Maida opens the big freezer, looks inside with disapproval.

MAIDA
If that freezer gets many more
fish it'll swim up-stream and
spawn -- all by itself,

She closes the freezer and goes to stand by the toaster -- waiting; — -—- -- -
The machine pops a piece of toast into the air. She catches it - -
matter-of-factly -- puts it on a plate, takes it to the table, places

it at Paul's elbow.

MAIDA
Could I have your attention for a
minute ?
PAUL
(still in the paper)
Um-hm,

MAIDA
I've been going over your checkbook.
Ican't pay me my salary. What did
you do with the fee from the Willy's
divorce? Help salt a uranium mine
or something? .

PAUL
I bought a few necessities.

MAIDA
Like a new outboard motor? Wish I
could be classed as a necessity.

Paul drains the coffee cup -- takes his hat from the corner of a
chair -- starts for the door into the hallway.

MAIDA
Don't you want your toast?

Purple Hearts. Professional
soldiers never have a dime. I
know. I was married to one.

28 EXT. IRON CLIFFS COUNTY COURTHOUSE AND JAIL - DAY

The CAMERA OPENS on Laura Manion's small, fuzzy dog, lying on
the sidewalk. PAN up the leash to his mistress. LAURA MANION
is dressed in high heels, tight ankle length capri pants and a thin
clinging jersey sweater. Her hair is smoothly brushed but careless. -
Her eyes are still concealed behind dark glasses. She is leaning

idly against the fender of her parked car. On the lawn about the
three-Storied, domed Courthouse the usual old men, forever found
loitering on the Courthouse lawns, are silently watching Laura,

7) The sensuous woman is not in the least embarrassed by their open-
mouthed attention. Beyond the Courthouse and separated from it by
an alley is the county jail. Its barred windows overlook the sidewalk
and street where Laura is waiting. Paul's car rolls up, nudges into
the curb. Paul gets out, sees Laura and the audience she has
gathered, After taking it all in for a moment he goes to where she
is waiting.

PAUL
I beg your pardon, are you
Mrs. Manion?

LAURA
Hi.

PAUL
I'm Paul Biegler,

LAURA
I'm Laura.

Her lips seem to always wear a tremulous, childish smile which
could be apologetic or inviting or a secret pleasure at the effect
she has on men, and is probably all of these, Muff barks at Paul.

Paul, a little embarrassed at the attention they are getting from the
old men on the courthouse lawn, takes Laura's arm and they move
toward the jail,

PAUL
Shall we walk to the jail?

The CAMERA STAYS with them as they go.

LAURA
You're tall.
PAUL
(slightly

os _ digsconcerted)
I hope I haven't kept you waiting long.

LAURA
I had company.

PAUL
Yes, I noticed,

She chuckles -- an appealing, throaty laugh.

INT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

There is a small reception area which contains a desk and a couple of
straight-backed chairs, Behind the desk is a barred steel door through
which we can see a flight of iron steps leading upward to the cell

floors, Another opening leads to the jailer's living quarters and another
door,,labeled SHERIFF,. goes off.into alarger office, The main door’. - |
opens -~ causing a buzzer to SOUND loudly somewhere off in the ;
jailer's quarters -- and Paul and Laura enter, SULO, the jailer, :
answering the buzzer, hurries into the office, Sulo is a stooped, slow

moving man with an open, good face. He speaks with a Finnish accent.

PAUL
Hello, Sulo,

SULO

Paul's hand)
Hello, Polly, It's good to see you,

PAUL
Thanks, Sulo.

Sulo unlocks the barred door, goes up the stairs as Laura and Paul
go into the Sheriff's office.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

A room off the turnkey's station, A desk, several chairs, filing
cabinets, a padlocked wall cage in which hang numerous and assorted
guns, A bulletin board is on one wall with many federal "wanted"
circulars, One large circular has 10 photographs and is headlined
"TEN MOST WANTED MEN." Along one side of the room a straight
white line has been painted on the floor, running from wall to wall,
On one wall at the end of the white line is a chart for testing vision.
The barred windows of the room look out into the street and over the
Courthouse lawn, Paul and Laura enter.

PAUL
Would you mind taking off your
glasses, Mrs. Manion?

A moment -- then she takes off the dark glasses. The swelling has
gone from the flesh about her eyes but dark bruises remain,

PAUL
Barney Quill do that to you?

: LAURA
More than that. You should see.
All over.

She smiles -- seems to be waiting for some reaction from Paul,

PAUL
Put them back on if it's more
comfortable for you.

Still smiling she slips the glasses back on -- a curiously
coquettish movement -- as if she were dropping a veil over her
face.

PAUL
Do you plan to stay for the trial,
Mrs. Manion?

LAURA
Are you serious?

_ LAURA
Why wouldn't I?

PAUL
Idon't know, Are you with your
husband or against him?

LAURA
Why, with him -- of course I'm
with him. You're awfully blunt,
aren't you?

PAUL
The only way I could know was to
ask,

In the reception office the steel door rattles and clangs shut. Sulo
enters the Sheriff's office with Lieutenant Frederick Manion. Manion
is about 28, with a smooth, handsome, cold face, He is neatly
clothed in tailored U.S, Army Officers fatigues. He stands stiffly --
almost Prussian,

SULO
This is Polly Biegler. This is
the bucko, Polly.
PAUL :
(extending his hand)
Lieutenant Manion.

Manion takes the hand briefly, drops it.

MANION
Hello there, I've been waiting
for you,

PAUL

Thanks, Sulo. Would you close
the door behind you?

PAUL
Sulo keeps good jail -- as good
as a jail can be kept,

MANION
Hello, Laura,

LAURA
Hi,

Until now Manion has ignored Laura's presence. This does not go
unnoticed by Paul,

PAUL
Mrs, Manion, could you meet me
at my office about 2 o'clock?
Ten-forty-two Main Street,

LAURA
Of course.

Paul opens the door for her, Laura rises and hesitates --
then goes to Manion, kissing him on the cheek.

LAURA
Anything I can get you, hon?

MANION
I'm alright, hon,

Laura smiles at Paul and goes. Paul closes the door, Almost
immediately Manion moves away, wandering about the reom,

MANION
(looking at the white
: line on the:floor). *
I could walk it, I could walk it
with a quart of red eye in my
belly.

Manion fastens his attention on the vision chart, He paces away from
the chart to the opposite side of the room, reads it glibly, swiftly,

MANION
P-L-U-T-O-D-I L-P-L-O-W-T-R-S-V,

‘One thing, we can't claim your
shooting Barney Quill was a case

Manion is not amused, He moves on to the bulletin board, reads the
big circular about the 10 most wanted,

PAUL
Where're you from, Lieutenant?
MANION
Originally Pennsylvania. Where are
you from?
PAUL
Here, All my life,
MANION

The big ten. We've got the 10 best
dressed dames, the 10 top tunes, the
10 top teams and now the 10 most
wanted,

PAUL
Don't knock it. It's the American dream,
Those boys made the grade.

Manion sits in a chair, takes out a carved ivory cigarette holder and
a package of cigarettes from his pocket, fits a cigarette into the
holder and lights it with a gold pocket lighter,

PAUL
(continues)
Where'd you get the holder ?

MANION
Korea, It's hand carved, Ming Dynasty,
400 years old, .

PAUL
Clever people, the Chinese - smoking
cigarettes in the sixteenth century.

MANION

MANION
You're forgetting that Barney Quill
raped my wife. I've got the unwritten
law on my side,

PAUL

(annoyed)
Lieutenant Manion, the unwritten law
is a myth, There is no such thing as
the unwritten law and anyone who
commits a murder on the theory that
it does exist has just bought himself
bed:and"board-in the State Penitentiary

perhaps we can proceed with a few
questions and answers which may be
some help to your defense, but
probably won't,

Lieutenant, there are four ways I
can defend murder. Number one:
it wasn't murder - it was suicide or
accidental, Number two: you didn't
do it, Number three: you were
legally justified - like self-defense
or protection of your home. Number
four: the killing was excusable.

MANION
Where do I fit into this rosy picture?

PAUL
I'l, tell you where you don't fit. You
don't fit in any of the first three.

MANION
Why wouldn't I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

PAUL
The time element. If you had caught
him in the act the shooting might have
been justified. But you didn't catch
him and you had time to bring in the
police. You didn't do that either.
You're guilty of murder, premeditated
and with vengeance. First degree
murder in any court of law,

When I advise you to cop out you'll
know it,

Exactly those words, Muff began to

It didn't seem any use there in the
woods, He began to shout names at
me - like, 'army slut' and some other
names - and then he drew back and
hit me with his fist. He hit me again
and I didn’t fight any more, I think
I was only half conscious, but I know
that he tore my panties off - and did
what he wanted,

remembering it, there were some pieces
missing. I remember going to the bar
with a gun, I remember Quill's face
behind the bar -- but I don't seem to
remember anything else, not even
going home,

PAUL
Don't you remember firing your gun?
Five shots are a lot of noise to forget.

MANION .
¥e. hey— —————-
didn't seem to be connected with me --
like they were far away, like somebody
else was doing the shooting,

Manion mops his face with a handkerchief, nervously fits a
cigarette into his holder. Paul waits for a moment or two,

PAUL .
Lieutenant Manion, I'll take your case.

MANION
(in great relief)
Thanks, Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

PAUL
Now there's the matter of a fee.
Three thousand. That's reasonable
enough, isn't it?

MANION
Sure -- sure, more than reasonable.

PAUL
When can you pay?

MANION
It'll have to be later, Right now I'm
broke,

PAUL
You're what?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

MANION
Broke -~ busted -- flat. I haven't
got three bucks, much less three
thousand.

PAUL
Well, can you raise it?

: MANION
No. Not until I get out of jail, but
payday is next week. I can give you
a hundred fifty on account. If you get
me off I'll give you a promissory note
for the rest.

PAUL
Suppose you're convicted?

MANION
That's a calculated risk, isn't it? --
for both of us.

PAUL
Suppose I don't go along with you unless
you pay me half of the fee?

MANION
(an amused glint)
I'd have to take a lawyer the Court
would appoint. I've got my defense
now, haven't 1? -- Insanity?

PAUL
You know, I think I'll just stay with
you, to make damned sure you get off.

MANION
You won't lose anything by it.

. PAUL
All right. It's a deal, I'll take the
one-fifty and a promissory note when
and if you're cleared.

MANION
Thanks.  Where.do we start? You'll have
to tell me. Remember, I've been
kind of nuts and I'm just recovering
my wits.

You do that. Okay, I'll get back to
you,
Paul goes to the door,
MANION
What will you do now?
PAUL -
See your wife again, for one thing.
MANION

(an odd pause)
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

The curious change in Manion's attitude registers with Paul,
PAUL:
That's right, Idid. She's a pretty
woman = your wife.

MANION

(trying tobe —
casual) '
A man gets used to the way his wife
looks.
PAUL

Yeah, I guess he does,

Okay, Sulo, .

See you.

Paul.exits, Manion stands very still, ‘his face drawn into its cold mask,

36 EXT. JAIL - DAY

Paul comes from the jail, pauses, thinking it over, puzzling with the
disturbing scene he's had with Manion, He moves on through the
alleyway between the jail and courthouse, enters the rear door of the
courthouse. |

INT. MITCH LODWICK'S OFFICE - DAY

A couple of secretaries are at work at their typewriters. The door
to Mitch's private office is open and MITCH is at his desk. As
Paul enters the outer office, Mitch spies him,

MITCH
(booming)
Come on in, Polly! Come on in!

Paul pushes through the office gate and goes into Mitch's private
office, The office is quite handsomely decorated with prints of
modern artists, new, modernistic furniture and vertical venetian
blinds,

MITCH

, (continues)
You haven't been in here since you
vacated, have you Polly? Don't
recognize the old place, huh? My
wife did it for me -- she's a graduate
decorator, Smart girl, very smart
girl. Look at this, real genuine Van
Gogh prints -- and here, here, try
this chair. It sort of does things.

He pushes Paul into a large contour chair. The moment Paul sits
the back drops down, the footrest leaps up and the chair begins to
massage. Paul endures the operation with slightly alarmed
patience, lying helplessly, shaking uncomfortably.

MITCH
(continues)
Great, isn't it? Good for the nerves
they say.

PAUL
(jiggling) .
How do you shut it off?
Mitch presses a button, The chair stops wiggling, snaps Paul .
into an ‘upright position; the footrest drops and‘his. feet hit the . ;
floor, : :

MITCH !
There we are, Feel better?

PAUL
(getting out of the chair)

MITCH
Judge Maitland is still in the hospital,
Maybe you'd like to agree toa
continuance until he gets back, If
we go with the case now, we'll have
to try before some grab-bag judge
they'll send in, Me, I'd rather have
Maitland,

PAUL
So would I -= but that would also mean
my client would have to lie in jail
for another two or three months before
the trial, Now if you drop the charge
down to manslaughter so I can get him
out on bail, we'll agree to a continuance.

MITCH
You wouldn't do that if you were D, A,
You wouldn't drop a charge from life
down to a fifteen year maximum penalty.

PAUL
I might... since a big fat lie-detector
test on his wife gave the truth to the
rape story, He'll have the jury with
him, .

MITCH
(into the trap)
How:did you know ==

 

He stops suddenly, Paul grins,

MITCH

EXT, COURTHOUSE - DAY

Paul comes from the courthouse down the steps and is greeted by
Laura's dog. Muff comes romping across the lawn to meet him --
Laura not far behind, Laura is dressed in tight Western slacks
and boots, Her blouse is Navajo with the laces open, revealing
the push of her ample bosom, With open-mouthed attention, the
eternal loiterers are following Laura's progress across the lawn.
Muff bounds into Paul's arms,

‘LAURA

He remembers you, Paul -= he likes
you,
PAUL

He likes the beer in my icebox,
(conscious again
of the attention ‘
they're getting)

On the driver's side of Paul's car is the handle to a spotlight
which is just outside the windshield, The spotlight is backed up

-by a rear-view mirror, As the scene proceeds, Paul casually

turns the handle, moving the mirror until it is trained upon the
jail, Inthe mirror, Paul can see Manion's cell window -- and
Manion is there watching,

PAUL
Couple of things have occurred to me.
The undergarments which Barney
tore off -- who has them now? -- the
police?

LAURA
You mean my panties?

PAUL
All right, your panties,

LAURA
I haven't seen them since. We gave
the torn skirt and sweater to the
police and I went with the police up
that lane into the woods but we
couldn't find anything except my
glasses,

PAUL
Your glasses? You don't mean you
were wearing glasses all through that.

LAURA
They were in a case in my hand, I
use them to read or play pinball --
things like that, I guess I tried to
get out of the car and dropped them.

PAUL
‘You!ll be interested'te know your
lie-deteéctor test came out in your

almost cowers in the corner, Shaken, she takes off her dark glasses
and covers her eyes for a moment with her hand,

Just enough. Are you afraid of him?

Is that the reason you volunteered
for a lie-detector test -- for him?

At least let me get you a beer instead

Strawberry pop reminds me of a better

No, no beer, I'll stick with this,

EXT, STREET IN THUNDER BAY - DAY

A winding, rambling street on the lake shore -- busy now, but in the
winter most of it will be shuttered, Thunder Bay is that kind of place.
MUSIC blares from the bingo parlor -- a sporting store with its
fishing tackle on the sidewalk engages the rapt attention of vacationing
fishermen -- testing rods, tinkering with reels. Children in bathing
suits run across the street without regard for traffic -- the traffic
pokes along -- plump matrons in shorts at the hot dog stands ~~ an
occasional slim, blossoming girl in a bathing suit -- men in white
ducks and sun visors == soldiers off duty, Most of the movement is
to and from the lake where rowboats drift about in the sun, fishermen

' cast from the piers and swimmers dive from the floats, Paul's car

comes slowly on the street, draws up to the curb by a sign which
advertises -- BRIGITTE'S BEAUTY SHOPPE, The car door opens
and Maida steps to the sidewalk,

PAUL
Meet me for lunch at Barney's inn...
down at the end of the street,

 

MAIDA
Right,

She closes the rear door, moves away toward the beauty shop and
enters, The front car door opens and Parnell bumbles out,

PAUL
Where are you going?

PARNELL
I'm going to tool around the taverns
in search of truth,

PAUL
Maybe you'd better stay with me.

PARNELL
Trust me, lad = trust me, I'll arrive
at the inn loaded with nothing more
than strawberry pop.

He closes the car-door, adjusts his hat at a rakish angle and strolls
down the street. Paul drives away.

 

EXT, THUNDER BAY INN - DAY

A large, three-story frame structure with a fresh coat of white paint,
screened~in verandas, its lawn shaded by elderly trees. It isa
well-kept relic from the turn of the century when Thunder Bay was a
more graceful resort, Outside the hotel are parked numerous cars
and tourists come and go from the main entrance,

An unlighted neon-sign identifies ‘THE THUNDER BAY INN"

and in smaller script advertises, “Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner,"
and in block letters, ''Cocktails.'' The bar room has a separate
entrance and is labeled by an unlighted neon-sign as the "BAR,"
Its door is closed and the windows shuttered with venetian blinds.
Paul drives up and finds a parking space near the entrance to the
bar. He gets out of the car and scans the front of the hotel before
going to the door of the bar room. On the closed door a sign reads,
"OPEN 5 p.m." Paul pushes the door, finds it mlocked, enters.

INT. THE INN - BAR - DAY

Like all bars concerned with evening business, the afternoon
atmosphere is cool, pleasant and restful. It is darkened, except
for back-bar lights and sunlight filtering from around the closed
venetian blinds, It is at the moment completely deserted. A
bartender has been at work, preparing the bar for its evening
business. A collection of empty bottles are on one end of the bar,
the glassware is covered by white cloths and a can of bar polish
is on the bar with a polishing rag. At one end of the bar are a
couple of pinball machines -- near the door, Chairs are stacked
on the tables and in the booths. Behind the bar one section of
the bar mirror is devoted to a display of gold and silver loving
cups and a collection of enlarged snapshots, mainly showing a
broad-chested, curly haired man of about fifty. Some of the
pictures include other people, but always the curly haired man

is prominent -~ holding a prize angling catch -- with a rifle in
his hand and a dead buck on the fender of his car -- with a target
pistol raised and posed -- and several other pictures of the same
man, probably made when he was in his twenties, wearing boxing
gloves and in fighting pose. One of the most recent snapshots
presents the man stripped to the waist, posed with a double-bitted
axe above a neatly severed log. Beyond the bar a short flight

of steps leads up to a closed door above which a sign reads:

"TO LOBBY." .

Paul, upon entering the room from the outside, pauses until his
eyes become accustomed to the darkness, glances. about, flips
the:plunger‘on. one of. the pinball machines; moves..on'to the bar.
His attention is attracted by the display of photographs and loving
cups. He moves around behind the bar, picks up a gold cup,
reads its inscription, replaces it, examines another, His attention
goes to the snapshots and he puts on his glasses for a finer study
of the pictures. From his POV the CAMERA CLOSES IN and
MOVES from picture to picture. Now in turning to come from
behind the bar, he notices a narrow shelf built up under one end
of the bar. He stoops, looks into the shelf, finds it empty.

.Puazling with the contraption he tentatively slips his hand into

the narrow space and suddenly withdraws the hand, finger and
thumb cocked to represent a pistol, He looks down the length of
the bar and sees two more shelves of like character, one in the
center by the space reserved for waiter's service and the other
at the far end, .

Why not now?

PAQUETTE
Because I don't have to now. Reason

Tke curtains over the booth are swept back and a dark-haired,
very lovely girl comes out. She is dressed ina simple summer
dress, She's in her twenties -- a fresh, pleasant face, slender,
handsome figure. . There is strength and pride in her clear eyes.
She comes toward the front of the shop, passing the manicurist
stand and from another angle we see that Maida is the manicurist's
customer, When MARY has passed by:

soldiers, most of them in fatigues. The soldiers serve themselves,
carrying the beer from inside the tavern. An awning is spread over
the area, The CAMERA MOVES IN on one of these outdoor tables
where Parnell is sitting with a group of soldiers, a bottle of soda pop
in his hand, A lean, tough SERGEANT is talking:

SERGEANT

a Army wife and beat her up == but
just let one of our guys make a little
pass at that babe he's got at the hotel

An atmosphere of uncontrived hominess, unpretentious, clearly
attractive to the small income vacationer seeking a home away

from home. The lobby is thriving and a group of guests are gathered
by the closed door to the dining room, waiting for the lunch hour

to arrive, Paulis among them, The double dining room doors are
swung open by a waitress and guests file into the dining room =~ a
spacious, cool place which includes part of the screened veranda

and overlooks the lake. Paul hesitates in the doorway.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Mary Pilant, acting as hostess, seats a group of tourists, goes to

She leads the way across the room to the veranda, Paul following and
in his retiring way obviously attracted.to this girl. At the table on the
veranda she draws a chair back for Paul.

Paul nods his thanks, A waitress comes from through the swinging
door of the kitchen, speaks to Mary and nods toward the kitchen.
She goes through the swinging door and the CAMERA MOVES IN
on the door. Moments pass. The swinging door is pushed open,
just a crack, and Mary's face is half seen looking out into the
dining room toward Paul. Behind Mary is Paquette, nodding and
whispering, seeming to say, ''That's him." Mary lets the door
close over her face. Maida enters, spies Paul, wends her way
through the tables to the veranda. Paul rises, pulls a chair back
for Maida.

PAUL
How was the manicure?

‘ MAIDA
Ask me any question about anybody.
I've got all the dope.

PAUL
Can you tell me about 2a woman named
Mary Pilant?

MAIDA

Easy. Mary Pilant may or may not
have been the mistress of the late
B. Quill. The manicurists are in favor
of the mistress theory and the hair
stylists are agin it. But all agree some
kind of hanky-panky was going on here.

Like what kind of a man your employer
was -- Mr. Quill,

MARY
A very nice man,

If that's true, how do you explain what
happened with Lieutenant. Manion's wife?

MARY
I don't know what happened with
Lieutenant Manion's wife, so there
really isn't anything for me to explain,

Guests appear in the dining room doorway and Mary rises.

So nice to have met you -- Mr. Biegler

PAUL
I beg your pardon,

Yessir?
PAUL

I'm Paul Biegler, attorney at law.
I represent the soldier who shot
Mr. Quill, I was just wondering --
did you happen to be on duty that
night ?

CLERK
Why yes sir, as a matter of fact I was...

The Clerk's attention is drawn away from Paul to Mary Pilant who
is standing in the dining room door, She gives a minute negative
shake of her head. Paul turns to follow the Clerk's gaze -- then
turns back to the Clerk,

CLERK
Sorry, I like my job, Mr. Biegler.

Paul nods, understanding that Mary has silenced the Clerk. He
goes toward the main exit, pauses as he comes abreast of Mary,
Parnell and Maida beside him. .

PAUL
Your loyalty.to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching, Miss Pilant,

Barney was well liked here, by
everyone, Mr. Biegler.

Very generous of everyone to overlook
hie little faults -- like raping other
men's wives.

Mary colors -- tears spring instantly into her eyes. Abruptly she
walks away.

Miller's side. Miller is a ravaged, hungry~looking prisoner with
shifty eyes and a slack mouth,

Thanks, mate.

MANION

card down)
Build Kings.

MILLER

Thanks, mate.

MANION
(throws in his
cards)
Take ‘em all.

He flings away from the game, goes to a window, his back to
Miller, nervously lights a cigarette. With a lop-sided grin,
Miller watches Manion. From below the SOUND of the steel
door opening and closing -- steps on the iron stairs, and Paul
appears on the landing -- goes to the bars of Manion's cell,

PAUL
Any word, Lieutenant?

 

Manion turns to Paul, takes out a letter, passes it through the
bars.

MANION
This -- from Washington. They'll
let a doctor come to testify, but
there's a string on it,

 

Paul opens the letter, reads it, his face growing impatient.

PAUL
I can't get you to the Army Hospital
in Detroit for the examination.
Doesn't the Army understand you're

Not for a while,

Where the hell is she?

PAUL
You've got other things to worry
about, Lieutenant. I'll get in touch
with her -- tell her you miss her,

MANION
(flatly)
Yeah -- you tell her that.

Manion glumly watches Paul go down the stairs. Then, in anger,

rw) hurls his lighted cigarette against the far wall of the cell -- falls
disconsolately on his bunk. Miller, from his cell, has watched
the scene between Paul and Manion. Now he comes close to the
bars,

MILLER
Know how you feel, Lieutenant,
I'd be pawing the ground too if
I had something like that outside,

MANION
Like what outside?

MILLER
Oh, man, you know what I mean --
something like that walking around
on the loose.

In a finely coordinated movement, Manion rises, reaches through
the bars, catches Miller's hair, jerks Miller down and against
the bars, Miller YELLS in pain, wrenches away, falling back
across his cot, Fast steps on the iron stairs and Sulo appears

Paul looks up from the keyboard and from his POV we see Laura,

tight, ‘dancing with a Second Lieutenant.

Hi, Polly -- That's what they call.

name for a crazy lawyer.

In CLOSE UP Paul is not smiling, his face suddenly tight and
grim, eyes following Laura as she dances away. From ANOTHER’
ANGLE across Paul, she moves away with the Lieutenant --
another soldier cuts in -- this one is a rock dancer and he and
Laura execute some of the more intricate steps of the sensuous
dance. The number ends with a CRASH OF CYMBALS from

INT, COURTHOUSE ROTUNDA - DAY

Groups of people stand about the rotunda, The marble stairway is
crowded, mostly with older women, curiosity seekers looking for

_athrill, From the main entrance comes CLAUDE DANCER, a

slight man, conservatively but expensively dressed, not a man to
draw immediate attention -~ but as he threads his way through the
clots of people in the rotunda and up the marble stairs the CAMERA
EXAMINES him a little more closely -- obsidian eyes, a

controlled intellectual face -- the face of a perceptive, clever

‘ man. As he pushes up the stairs he apologizes to those he brushes

against, tips his hat to a group of ladies as he presses on.

_TOP OF COURTHOUSE STAIRS
’ Here the main doors to the courtroom are guarded by a DEPUTY

SHERIFF and here the traffic jam ends in a hubbub of protest.
In the b. g. Dancer is working his way up the stairs.

That courtroom can hold another
hundred people, I know.

DEPUTY
Sorry, folks, this new judge won't
allow any standees. You might as
well go on home,

Dancer arrives, hands the Deputy a slip of paper. The Deputy
glances at the paper and opens the courtroom door,

DEPUTY
Yessir, go right in.

{removing his hat
ashe enters)
Thank you, officer.

COURTROOM
Dancer halts just inside the main doors as they close behind him,

From his POV we look across the heads of the seated spectators
to where Judge Weaver is on his bench, questioning the jurors.

 

JUDGE WEAVER
Now ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, before we proceed further I
must examine you for qualifications
to sit here as jurors, Please

rises to meet him, shakes his hand, presents him with a chair
at the Prosecutor's table.

A mumble of no's,". Parnell, who sits with Maida on the
spectators' bench immediately behind Paul and Manion, has
seen Dancer's entrance. As the Judge's questions proceed,
Parnell takes a note pad from his pocket, scratches a note,
hands it to Maida who leans forward, passes it to Paul. Paul
scans the note.

72 INSERT: NOTE :

"The guy with Mitch is trouble -
shooter from Attorney General's
office. I've seen him in action
in Detroit. Look out."

 

73 CLOSE SHOT - PAUL

He folds the note before glancing toward Mitch's table. At
Mitch's table, Dancer looks toward Paul's tablé and their eyes
meet. Paul turns his attention again to the business at hand --
but a little disturbed. If Mitch has called in a ringer it could
mean severe trouble, Judge Weaver has continued through this

: action.

There is a little suggestion I wanted
to make,

JUDGE WEAVER
By all means,

DANCER
Since the defense plea is insanity, the
prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.
Under the statutes we have a right to
petition for a mental examination of
the defendant by our own doctor. Are
you familiar with the statute, Mr. Biegler?

PAUL
Moderately.

DANCER

It would delay things to file a formal
petition. Why don't we get together
and informally agree to ask his honor
for an adjournment -- just for a day
or so, and let our doctor visit with
the defendant. It will save everybody
time, don't you think, Mr. Biegler?

Judge Weaver's eyes dart to Paul as a tennis fan following a fast
hit ball,

PAUL
(eyes twinkling)
I'm sure it would,
The Judge's eyes bounce to Dancer.

: DANCER
Good,

 

PAUL
But suppose you go. ahead and file
the formal petition anyway. Of course,
you're a little late, but maybe his

PAUL
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose
was to ascertain the cause of death,
was. it not?

RASCHID
Yes,

PAUL
Yet I see by your report that you
checked to determine whether
spermatogenesis was occurring in
the body of the deceased at the time
of death,

MITCH
Objection, Your Honor -- the People
have called this witness only to show
cause of death,

PAUL
Your Honor, the entire report has
been entered as evidence and the
report contains this information
about spermatogenesis,

JUDGE WEAVER
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick, Take the

answer,
So RASCHID .
Yes, I made that examination on the
deceased,
PAUL

will you tell the Court your findings?

RASCHID
Spermatogenesis was occurring at
the time of death,

PAUL
In other words, the deceased, in life,
was not sterile -- he could produce
children? Is that correct, Doctor?

- Was no completion onthe part of the man.

RASCHID
That is correct,

PAUL
Now, Doctor, if a woman says she's
had intercourse with a certain man
and this man is proved fertile yet no
evidence is found in the woman's body,
couldn't a lawyer-- say a prosecuting
attorney--use this as evidence that
the woman is lying?

MITCH ;
Your Honor, I object to this line of
questioning. We're not concerned
here with whether or not there's been
relations between a man and a woman.

PAUL ~

‘Since an examination for spermatogenesis

was made, certainly we're entitled to
know why.

JUDGE WEAVER
Objection overruled. Take the answer.

RASCHID
Yes, prosecution could use that--
though certainly it would not be
conclusive that she was lying.

PAUL
Why not?

-RASCHID
Well, there could be several reasons
why the test on her was negative--the use
of a contraceptive or perhaps there

PAUL —
In this post-mortem were you also
asked to determine whether or not
the deceased had had a sexual climax
shortly before his death?

RASCHID
No.

Could you have made such a determination?

RASCHID
Yes.

examination as might be useful to the
prosecution, but none which might help
the defense, although such evidence might
have existed?

RASCHID
Well, yes --

DANCER
lobject, Your Honor. The question
is argumentative. Counsel for the
defense is trying to impugn the intent
of the representatives of the People.

JUDGE WEAVER
Mr. Biegler, you're aware that the
question is highly improper,

I'll withdraw the ques‘ion and apologize,’

I withdraw the question, Your: Honor,

"Now, Mr. Paquette, had Barney
changed his clothes since he left the
bar?

he have changed his clothes?

PAQUETTE

PAUL
Was Barney drinking that night?

PAQUETTE
Well, he always had a few shots while
he was talking to the customers, He
was friendly,

PAUL
Good old Barney,’ Now how many
shots would you say good old Barney
usually had?

PAQUETTE
I don't know exactly,

PAUL :
Was he drinking more than usual that
night?

PAQUETTE
Not ta my knowledge.

PAUL
Wasn't he in fact pretty well loaded
that night, Mr, Paquette?

Objection, Your Honor, If the deceased
was dead drunk it's no defense to

this charge,
JUDGE WEAVER

Mr, Biegler,

PAUL
Mr. Paquette, what do you call a man
who has an insatiable penchant for
women?

The attorneys will provide the wisecracks,

PAUL
“What else would you call a man like
that, Mr. Paquette?

MITCH
We can't see the drift of this, Your
Honor,

PAUL

You mean you do see it, Mr, Lodwick,

JUDGE WEAVER
Take the answer.

Can you think of another name, Mr,
Paquette?

PAQUETTE
Woman chaser,

PAUL

PAQUETTE
Masher?

PAUL

Come now, Mr. Paquette, mashers
went out with whalebone corsets and
hairnets, Did you ever hear the
expression ‘wolf?!

 

PAQUETTE
Sure, I've heard that, It slipped
my mind,

PAUL

Naturally it would, clanking around
in there with all those rusty old
mashers, Have you ever known a

Paquette ?

JUDGE WEAVER
Sustained. The question was answered,
he couldn't say.

PAUL
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned
from wherever he had been, did he
relieve you at the bar?

PAQUETTE
Yes,

PAUL
What did he say when he relieved you?

PAQUETTE
He said, 'I'll take over, !

PAUL
Did he say anything else? Did he
whisper anything to you?

PAQUETTE

PAQUETTE
Yes,

And how long was it before Lieutenant
Manion came in?

PAQUETTE
I don't know exactly -- maybe thirty
minutes,
PAUL
You remained at the Pedersons' table
all this time?
PAQUETTE
Yes -- they're friends of mine,
PAUL
Isn't there also a window by that table?
PAQUETTE
I think so.
PAUL

You think so? How long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay Inn, Mr. Paquette?

PAQUETTE
About six or seven years,

PAUL
Well,. does that window beside that table
sometimes vanish and then appear again?
Does it come and go in a ghostly fashion?

Manion? .

Paquette freezes, licks his lips nervously,

MITCH
Lobject, Your Honor, Counsel has gone
far afield,

JUDGE WEAVER
Perhaps so, Mr. Lodwick, but there
seems-to-be no real offense. Take the

answer,
PAUL
Did he tell you to watch for Lieutenant
Manion?
PAQUETTE
He did not.
PAUL

Mr. Paquette, Barney Quill was quite
a marksman, wasn't he, with guns?
He'd won prizes for. shooting, hadn't he?

PAQUETTE
Yes.

PAUL
He was well known for his skill, wasn't
he? He also kept loving cups, pictures
and write-ups about his shooting on
display behind the bar, didn't he?

concealed pistol racks behind that

one of insanity, not self-defense,

JUDGE WEAVER
I'm sure Mr, Biegler has not forgotten
that fact, Mr. Lodwick, Take the answer.

PAUL
Are there concealed gun racks behind
the bar? .

PAQUETTE
Yes,

PAUL
How many people knew about those gun
racks?

PAQUETTE
I couldn't say.

PAUL

Isn't it a fact that Barney sometimes
took the pistols out of those racks,
spinning them on his fingers, showing
off his prowess for his customers?

him do this yourself?.. .

Detective Sergeant James Durgo.
Michigan State Police,

Were you called to Thunder Bay by
Deputy Sherifi Lemon of Thunder
Bay on the night that Barney Quill
was shot and killed?

DURGO
Yes sir, Iwas. My companion
officer and I were the first to. be
called in on the case.

MITCH
Sergeant Durgo, when you arrived at
the Manion trailer, who was there?

. DURGO
Lieutenant Manion and his wife were
there,
MITCH

What did Lieutenant Manion say to you?

DURGO
He said that his wife had had some
trouble with Barney Quill and that
he had gone to the tavern and shot
Quill, He asked us whether Quill
was dead or not and we told him he
was,

 

MITCH
How did Lieutenant Manion take
this information?

DURGO
He didn't seem surprised,

MITCH
What did you do then, Sergeant
Durgo?

DURGO
I asked for the gun he had used.

Did you take Lieutenant Manion to
the County jail here in Iron City on
_that same night?

DURGO
Yes sir. We drove the Lieutenant
down with his wife.

MITCH
On the drive to Iron City did the
Lieutenant talk further about the
shooting ?

DURGO
He remarked that if he had the whole
thing to do over again he would still
do it. He also said that he had thought
about it before going to the bar and
had decided that Quill shouldn't be
allowed to live,

MITCH
Through all this -- at the trailer --
the drive to Iron City, how did
Lieutenant Manion appear to you?

DURGO
He was very quiet most of the time
and seemed clear-headed,

MITCH
You would say he was calm?

Yes -- calm.

call it 'some trouble! by a person
now in this room?

DURGO

Now would you please tell the Court
what words Lieutenant Manion
actually used to describe the 'trouble'
his wife had had?

MITCH
Objection, your honor. We've been
over this before. This information
would not be relevant to any issue
before the Court.

PAUL

This statement concerning 'some
trouble' was brought out during the
direct examination of Sergeant Durgo.

Up to. now the prosecution has. adroitly !
restricted all of their witnesses’
testimonies where Laura Manion has :
been concerned, But now the cat is
out of the bag and it's fair game for
me to chase it,

MITCH
Your honor, the burden is on the
defense to prove temporary insanity
at the time of the shooting. If the
reason for the alleged insanity is
important to this case then that is
a matter for a competent witness --
an expert on the subject of the human
mind, What the defense is trying to
do is introduce some sensational
material for the purposes of obscuring
the real issues,

PAUL
Your honor, how can the jury accurately
estimate the testimony being given here
unless they first know the reason behind
this whole trial -- why Lieutenant
Manion shot Quill? The prosecution
would like to separate the motive from
the act. That's like trying to take
the core from an apple witheut breaking
the skin, Well, the core of our defense
is that the defendant's temporary insanity
was triggered by this so-called 'trouble!
with Quill, I beg the Court to let me
cut into the apple.

MITCH
Our objection still stands, your honor,

The courtroom is silent. All attention upon Judge Weaver. This
is why he is called judge, because alone he must decide what is
just or unjust. Judge Weaver, in deep study, takes out his watch,
winds it, the SOUND clearly heard in the silent room, He looks
at Paul, Manion, Laura, Dancer and Mitch. He looks out over the
slack-mouthed thrill seekers among the spectators and from his
POV we, too, look at all these people, Finally the judge leans
back in his chair, puts his watch back.in his pocket,

JUDGE WEAVER
I'll take the answer.

 

A wave of muted excitement travels through the courtroom. Paul,
gratified and triumphant, rises to continue the cross-examination.
Mitch rises, intending to protest the judge's decision, but is stayed

panties will be mentioned again in
the course of the trial and when that
happens there will not be one laugh,

Sergeant, did you further investigate
Mrs. Manion's story?

notice any bruises or marks on
Mrs. Manion at that time?

DOMPIERRE
Idid.
PAUL

Were you asked to determine the
reason for these bruises?

DOMPIERRE
I was not.

PAUL
Where did you do the laboratory work
on the test for sperm?

DOMPIERRE
a . Saint Margaret's Hospital in this
Ss -eitye—-

PAUL

Who worked the slides up for you?
DOMPIERRE

A technician at the hospital.
PAUL

What kind of a technician?
DOMPIERRE

Oh, X-Ray -- like that.

PAUL
Was he a pathologist or an expert
in laboratory work having to do with
human reproduction?

DOMPIERRE
He was just a technician,

PAUL
Woulda't it have been better to
have these'slides worked up by a
pathologist or an expert in this
field?

DOMPIERRE
Yes, but the police were in a hurry
and I knew this young fellow came on
at seven in the morning.

PAUL
Wouldn't it have been especially better
to wait for an expert if the possible
question of rape hung on the result?

DOMPIERRE
It would have been,

PAUL
Now, Doctor, in the newspaper on the
evening of August sixteen it was stated
that you had found no evidence of rape.
Is that true?

DOMPIERRE
It is not true. I made no such statement,
PAUL
Did you form an opinion about whether
Mrs, Manion had been raped?

DOMPIERRE
No, sir,

PAUL
Why didn't you form an‘ opinion?

DOMPIERRE
It's impossible to tell if a mature
married woman has been raped,

PAUL
No further questions.

DANCER
Doctor, did you have an opinion about
whether or not she had any recent
relations with a man?

- ot DOMPIERRE
Yes. .
DANCER
State your opinion,

DOMPIERRE
Insofar as no sperm was present, it
didn't appear that she had had recent
relations with a man,

DANCER
That's all.

One more question, Doctor, That no
evidence was present in her body does
not mean she wasn't raped, does it?

DOMPIERRE
No,

PAUL
Do you know what constitutes rape under
the law?

DOMPIERRE

Yes, sir. Violation is sufficient for
rape, There need not be a completion.

PAUL
No more questions,

JUDGE WEAVER
Witness may step down.

DANCER
The People recall Alphonse Paquette
to the stand,

Paquette comes forward,

JUDGE WEAVER
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

Paquette goes to the witness box.

DANCER

Your Honor, since counsel for the
defense has forced the question of
rape, it becomes necessary to take
this additional testimony from Mr,
Paquette.

ui) (to Paquette)’
Mr. Paquette, will you take a look
at Mrs, Manion, sitting there at
the defense table? Was she dressed
in this manner on the night of the
shooting?

PAQUETTE
No,

How was she dressed that night?

I recollect she had on a real tight
skirt and a sweater-kind-of-thing
sort of glued on, She was wearing a
pair of red shoes with high heels...

DANCER
Was she wearing hose?

PAQUETTE
No, she was bare-legged,

DANCER
Was she wearing a hat?

PAQUETTE
No.

Three women on the jury, three nice respectable matrons, have——_______
gotten a pinched look about their faces.

DANCER
Mr. Paquette, what kind of hair does
Mrs. Manion have under that hat?

PAUL
We'll be glad to show the Court Mrs.
Manion's hair, Mrs, Manion, will
you take off your hat, please?

Laura jerks her hat off, pulls a couple of hairpins and disdainfully
shakes out her glamorous tresses,

DANCER
Thank you, Counselor, Mr. Paquette,
was she wearing glasses that night ?

PAQUETTE
I think she was when she played
DANCER

Considering the tight skirt and the
tight.sweater and the bare legs, what
was the result in her appearance?

PAQUETTE
Well.....

DANCER
Would you say Mrs. Manion's appearance
on that night was deliberately voluptuous
and enticing?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (5)

PAQUETTE
Well, you could pretty much see
everything she had.

PAUL
Your Honor, defense will concede
that Mrs, Manion when dressed
informally is an astonishingly
beautiful woman, As a matter of
fact, it's pretty easy to understand
why her husband became temporarily

‘deranged when he saw such beauty

bruised and torn by a beast,

Judge Weaver blows his nose to keep from laughing.

DANCER
Your Honor, I protest. Mr. Biegler
is perhaps the least disciplined and
the most completely out-of-order
attorney I've ever seen in a courtroom.

A laugh goes through the courtroom,

JUDGE WEAVER
(rapping)
Jury will ignore Mr, Biegler's oration.

DANCER
Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily
that night?

PAQUETTE

Well, I sold her six drinks myself
and Barney came over and got some
more for her.. I don't remember

how many.

DANCER
‘Would you say that Mrs, Manion was,
tight? :

PAQUETTE
Yes,

DANCER
Anything else?

PAQUETTE
When she'd made a good score she

She was playing pinball with Barney
Quill, wasn't she?

What was her attitude toward Barney
Quill?

Friendly, I guess you could call it,

More than friendly perhaps?

say that Mrs, Manion was free and
easy with Barney Quill?

Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

(rising)

Mr. Paquette, the attorney for the
People asked you if Mrs, Manion
was tight and you said she was high.
} Speaking as a bartender, what is

5 the distinction between the two?

PAQUETTE
} I don't think I understand,

PAUL
When we say a person is tight we
' usually mean they're a little stupid
with drink, isn't that right?

PAQUETTE
I guess that's about it, yes.

° ‘PAUL
But if they're high they're gay and
enjoying themselves?

PAQUETTE
Yes.
PAUL
- So in other words, Mrs, Manion
was happy. Now is there anything
wrong with being happy in the
Thunder Bay Inn?

e PAQUETTE
No.

Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't
it? Swimming, fishing, that sort
of thing.

PAQUETTE
Yes,

PAUL
Is it unusual to see a barefooted
woman in Thunder Bay?-

PAQUETTE
No.

PAUL
So Mrs, Manion taking off her shoes
in Thunder Bay doesn't necessarily
mean that she was being unladylike,

does it?

PAQUETTE
I guess not,

PAUL
Yes or no,

PAQUETTE
No.

PAUL

You testified that Mrs, Manion was
squealing, jumping up and down and
swishing her hips at the pinball
machine. Was she creating a
disturbance, was she attracting

a crowd?

PAQUETTE
No,

PAUL
Were all of the men in the bar
standing around watching Mrs. Manion?

PAQUETTE
No.

PAUL
But you were conscious of Mrs, Manion,
enough so that you can tell us how she
acted, .

PAQUETTE
Yes.

PAUL
And certainly Barney Quill was
conscious ‘of Mrs, Manion, because
he was playing pinball with her,
Wouldn't you say so?

PAQUETTE
Yes,

. PAUL
So it seerns that only you and Barney

Quill were acutely aware of Mrs,

Manion and her actions and appearance,

Perhaps Barney, when he came to

get some drinks, perhaps he winked

and said, ‘Alphonse, I'm going to

take this babe out and rape her. ' oa

No, no he didn't!

I'm just a lawyer doing my job. What
are you so afraid of, Al?

Paul turns.. Mary Pilant, dressed in skirt anda coat-sweater, has
just entered the bar from the lobby. Her face is pale and concerned.
She approaches Paul, waits for him to speak,

You mean why am I here?

MARY
You didn't come just to apologize,

No - no - but the apology was part of
it. Tell you the truth I thought it
might thaw you out just a little. Now
all I want you to do, Miss Pilant, is
listen for just a few minutes, I need
some strong evidence to back up Laura
Manion's story about the rape. The
prosecution is going to attack that story
pretty hard - and if the jury thinks she's
lying it could turn their decision against
Manion,

Well, isn't she lying? Barney didn't
do what she said he did, He couldn't
have,

What did you know about your father?

All I needed to know = that he took care
of me = and of my mother ~ for as long

as she lived, He would have’ married

her, but he was already married, When

he finally got a divorce it was too late,

Now just ~ hear me out, please. I
believe that Barney told Al Paquette
what happened that night and sent Al
to the window here to watch out for
Manion - while he stood by by one of
his gun racks - waiting. Manion came
in and fired almost the moment he
entered the door and that first shot went
right through Barney's heart, All I
want is for you to try and persuade Al
to come into court as a defense witness
and tell the court what Barney told him
- that he had raped and assaulted Mrs,
Manion,

Al wouldn't conceal that. Why wouldn't
he tell it if it were true?

It has been testified that your wife
swore to you on a rosary that she
had been raped by Barney Quill, Did
you ask her to swear on a rosary?

MANION
My wife was hysterical and wasn't
making much sense, I thought if I
asked her to take an oath on the rosary
it might serve to calm her and make
her think clearly.

Did the rosary help?

MANION

had happened,

PAUL
Now go on from here, What did you
do then, Lieutenant ?

cold cloths for her head and == oh yes,

PAUL
wy) But Mr. Lemon right in the tourist
park was a deputy sheriff, Why didn't
you get him to go with you?

MANION

I don't know why I didn't think of Mr.
Lemon. Maybe because he always
seemed to be nothing except the old
caretaker of the park. Maybe because
I wasn't thinking too clearly about
anything -- except finding Barney
Quill,

Why didn't you go to the telephone
and call the State Police before you
went to the bar?

MANION
I don't know why. I was in sort of

We call Laura Manion to the stand,

Manion hurries to sit beside Paul.

Wait.

Nervously, hands gripping her purse, Laura is sworn.

INT. COURTHOUSE ROTUNDA - DAY

Mary Pilant enters the Courthouse, comes into the rotunda,
hesitates with uncertainty at the bottom of the stairs, then goes up.

INT, COURTROOM - DAY

Laura is on the stand, Paul questioning, As Laura talks, in the
back of the courtroom Mary enters. The Deputy inside the door
shows her to a space on a spectator bench, Paul sees Mary
enter, follows her with curious eyes as she is seated.

PAUL
How long after you told your husband
what had happened did he leave the
trailer?

LAURA
1 don't know exactly, Everything was
kind of fuzzy. Iwas faint and I lay ©
‘down on the bed. and he sat beside ‘me.
I vaguely remember his getting up and
going out, I remember wondering if
he was going for a doctor and then he
came back in, It seemed just a few
seconds but it must've been longer --
I must've gone to sleep. When he
came back in and sat on the bed he
had a gun in his hand and I said,
‘What are you going to do?' And he
said, 'I think I've already done it.
I think I've killed Barney Quill. '

PAUL
Now what did you do?

LAURA
I put my arms around him and began
to cry and I said, ‘You'd better go
to Mr. Lemon! and my husband said,
‘I forgot about that, '

PAUL :
What did he mean =- forgot about
what?

LAURA

He meant he'd forgotten that Mr, Lemon
was a Deputy Sheriff and he said, 'Yes,
I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon, !

PAUL
Your honor, I have no other direct
questions at this time, But since I'm
sure the credulity of the Court has
been strained about the part the
little dog played on this night, I
should like a few minutes to show
the Court this remarkable little
animal,

JUDGE WEAVER
Do the People have objections?

DANCER
I know if we raise an objection Mr,
Biegler will declare that we are
haters of all small furry animals.
And I must also admit I'm curious
to see this dog which leads the way
home for ladies in distress,

away. The Deputy re-enters, carrying a traveling case for a dog.

PAUL

Just let the dog out there,

The Deputy puts the case on the floor and opens its door. Muff
bounces out,

Come on, Muff,

The little dog scampers down the aisle and bounds into Paul's arms.

PAUL

Now I'll ask Mrs. Manion to give the
dog a flashlight.

Laura steps down from the box and takes a small flashlight from
her purse, Paul places the dog on the floor and the dog runs to
Laura, romping in delight as he sees the flashlight.

LAURA
Hello, baby -- hello, sweetie. Does
sweetie want the flashlight?

PAUL
I'd like the Court to notice that the
dog will turn the light on,

Laura puts.the flashlight on the floor and: Muff paws at it, seizes
it in his mouth, his teeth over the switch, The light goes on,

A ripple of amusement and approval from the jury which swells
to laughter as. Muff runs to Dancer with the light, stands up with
his paws on Dancer's leg, Judge Weaver raps for silence,

married three days after the divorce.

Laura and Paul have locked eyes, He is deliberately showing
her that she must not be evasive. Dancer looks from one to
the other, grasping the situation,

Thank you, Mr. Biegler, Is that
correct, Mrs. Manion? :

Well, no -= the divorce -= you know.

DANCER
You mean you have been ex-communicated
because of the divorce?

LAURA

Yes,

DANCER
Mrs, Manion, wouldn't you say that
a Catholic who can blithely ignore
a cardinal rule of her church can
also easily ignore an oath taken on
one of its artifacts -- say an oath
taken on a rosary?

LAURA
I don't think that's true.

DANCER
But wouldn't you think there'd be
some doubt about the integrity of
such a person?

I don't know. All I know is the
rosary means something to me.

DANCER
(smoothly)
I see. Well, I'll pass on to something
else,

LAURA
Not much, A little.

witness complete a statement if
she can, Mr, Dancer, before you
interrupt,

Of course, your honor, In any case,
Mr. Biegler's objection has given
Mrs. Manion sufficient time to think
of an answer to my question, You've
thought of one, haven't you, Mrs,
Manion?

LAURA
What I was going to say is that I
didn't want to offend Mr. Quill by
making him think I was afraid of
him or didn't like him. He had
been very pleasant to my husband

Your honor, I object to this line
of questioning. It's immaterial
what Mrs. Manion does all the
time, On the night she was attacked
she was wearing panties. That's
all we're concerned with,

DANCER
Your honor, Mrs. Manion seems
uncertain about what kind of panties
she was wearing and since these
panties have not been found I submit
that it's possible she wasn't wearing
any and has forgotten. That's what
I'm trying to get at.

JUDGE WEAVER
Take the answer, Mrs. Manion.

De you always wear panties?

Doctor, have you formed an opinion,
as to Frederick Manion's emotional
disorganization at the time he killed
Barney Quill?

SMITH
Ihave,

PAUL
What is that opinion?

SMITH
He was temporarily insane at the
time of the shooting,

At the time of the shooting do you
believe that he was able to distinguish
right from wrong?

He may or may not have been. It
doesn't make too much difference,

103

 

 

168,

CONTINUED:

PAUL
Now doctor, as clearly as you can,
will you explain Frederick Manion's
temporary insanity?

SMITH.
It is known as dissociative reaction,
A psychic shock which creates an
almost overwhelming tension which
the person in shock must alleviate.
In Lieutenant Manion's case, a soldier,
it is natural that he would turn to
action. Only direct simple action
against Barney Quill would relieve
this unbearable tension. This is not
too uncommon, For example in
combat -- in war I mean -- some of
the more remarkable heroics take
place in this state of mind. Soldiers
who have performed fantastically
brave acts are frequently unable to
recall having performed those acts
because they were at the time in
the grip of dissociative reaction,

PAUL
Is there another name for dissociative
reaction, one we are more likely to
recognize?

SMITH -
Yes, It has been known as
‘irresistible impulse, '

Paul glances toward the prosecution table, Dancer and Mitch are ,
in a whispering huddle.. Paul half-grins, .

PAUL
Now doctor, a man in the. grip of
irresistible impulse.-- would he be
likely to go to a neighbor for advice,
would he call the police to come to
his aid?

SMITH
Completely incompatible, In this
trance-like state he would be unable
to think of anything except the relief
of this massive tension.

PAUL
But our man was able to think of
taking out a gun and loading it before
he set off to find Barney Quill,

PAUL (cont'd)
He testified that he got the gun
because he was afraid Quill would
shoot him, If he was in a trance~like
state, how do you explain this?

SMITH
That was his conscious mind working --
but if no gun had been available he
would have gone anyway -- bare-handed =-
he would have walked into the mouth
of acannon, It's important to
understand that the very essence
of his manhood was at stake, Nothing
short of oblivion or death could have
prevailed against his overpowering
need,

PAUL
Would this tension interfere with
his physical ability? -- say his ability
to accurately fire a gun?

SMITH
It probably would have heightened
his ability,

PAUL

How would a man look when in the
grip of dissociative reaction?

SMITH .
He might appear to be deadly calm --
fiercely deliberate.

PAUL
Gould you describe his behavior as
being like a mailman delivering the
mail? .

SMITH
That's not bad. Like a mailman, he

would have one job to do and he
would do it.

PAUL
Would a man in this state be apt to
converse with other men?

likely initiate conversation,

DANCER
Doctor, did you find any psychosis in
Frederick Manion?

Any history of conversion hysteria?

SMITH
Well, irresistible impulse embraces
what has been called conversion
hysteria,

DANCER
In common language isn't conversion
hysteria also known as a fit of temper?

SMITH
I know of no reputable psychiatrist
who would so describe it,

DANCER
But a layman might call it that?

SMITH
Probably, yes.

DANCER
Isn't that what really happened? In
a fit of temper -- in a fit of rage, the
Lieutenant walked over and shot
Barney Quill,

SMITH

‘No, not in my opinion, That is not

what happened,

DANCER
Doctor, you stated that the Lieutenant
might or might not have been able to
distinguish right from wrong == but
that it didn't make much difference.
Am I right? Is that what you said?

SMITH
Approximately -- yes,

DANCER
Did you mean that at the time of the
shooting he could have known the
difference between right and wrong?

SMITH
He might have, yes.

DANCER
Doctor Smith, if the defendant could
have known what he was doing and
could have known that it was wrong,
how can you come here and testify
that he was legally insane?

 

SMITH
I'm not saying he was legally insane.
I'm a doctor, not a lawyer. I'm
saying that in his mental condition
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong =-
he would still have shot Quill, He
could not have prevented himself
from doing so.

DANCER
In other words, what he did he did
willfully and in anger?

wo es SMITH
The words ‘anger! and 'wiliful' are
an immense simplification of a very
complicated mental condition, I
repeat, Lieutenant Manion was
temporarily insane,

DANCER
Are you willing to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

SMITH

and lay a blue pall of good Virginia
burley on that hallowed precinct out

pipe lighted)
All right, Mr. Dancer,

DANCER

testimony the defense might like to
change their plea.

PAUL
Change it to what?

DANCER
To guilty, of course.

PAUL
No, we'll still go for broke.

DR, W. GREGORY HARCOURT is being sworn. Now he takes the
witness stand, Dancer rises to examine, .

. DANCER
Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive
your university training?

HARCOURT
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.
DANCER
When were you admitted to the practice
of medicine ?
HARCOURT
1924,
DANCER

Since that time have you specialized
in any particular field of medicine?

(CONTINUED)

 
176,

CONTINUED:

HARCOURT
Ihave -- the field of psychiatry.

DANCER
Where do you practice now?

HARCOURT
Iam the medical superintendent of the
Bonder State Hospital for the insane,
Iam also psychiatric examiner for the
Veterans! Administration,

DANCER
Do you then feel that you have particular
knowledge of the mental ills and problems
of soldiers?

HARCOURT
I do.

DANCER
It has been stated here that dissociative
reaction or irresistible impulse is not
uncommon among soldiers in combat.
Do you agree with that statement?

HARCOURT
Ido, But not as it was put by Dr, Smith.

DANCER
Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?

HARCOURT
Well, dissociative reaction is not
something which comes out of the
blue and disappears as quickly. It
can only occur -- even among soldiers
in combat -- if the individual has a
psycho-neurotic condition of long
standing. :

PAUL
Iobject, Your Honor. Is the Doctor
stating a proved fact or an opinion?
We are not dealing here with chicken
pox or a sore throat but with the
mysteries of the human mind. If
the Doctor is giving his opinion it
should be qualified as such.

JUDGE WEAVER
Sustained. Do you want to straighten
this out, Mr. Dancer?

DANCER ‘
Your answer, Doctor, was of course
your opinion, wasn't it?

HARCOURT
That goes without saying, doesn't it?

PAUL
No, it doesn't. Your Honor...

JUDGE WEAVER

 

(patiently)
Just say it is your opinion, Doctor,
please.
HARCOURT
My answer was an opinion,
PAUL
(sitting)
All right.
DANCER

Iam sure the jury has forgotten your
answer by now, Doctor. Let's go back.
Is it your opinion that dissociative
reaction could not occur one time

and one time only?

HARCOURT
Yes. There would have been repeated
upsets of a dissociative nature.

DANCER
It has been testified here that a
psychiatric examination of the
defendant showed no evidence of
neuroses or history of dissociative
reaction, You have heardit further

testified here that the defendant's ©

behavior on the night of the shooting
was cool and direct. As an observer
do you remember this testimony?

HARCOURT
Yes.

DANCER
From this have you formed an opinion
about the defendant's sanity on the
night of the shooting?

105 CONTINUED: (3)

HARCOURT
Yes. Iam of the opinion that he was
in sufficient possession of his faculties
so that he was not dominated by his
unconscious mind.

DANCER
In other words he was not in the grip
of irresistible impulse?

HARCOURT
In my opinion he was not.

DANCER
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

PAUL
Dr. Harcourt, psychiatry is an effort
to probe into the dark undiscovered
world of the mind -- and in there the
world might well be round or it could
be square -- your opinion could be
wrong and Dr. Smith's opinion could
be right, isn't that true?

HARCOURT
I'd be a poor Doctor if I didn't agree
with that. But I believe my opinion
to be right.

PAUL
And good Doctor that you are, you
very carefully used the word believe,
didn't you? :

HARCOURT
Yes,

. PAUL . .
Do you think you would have been less
positive if you had examined the
defendant as Dr. Smith did?

HARCOURT
I believe it would have helped to
confirm my opinion.

PAUL
But isn't it possible it might have
caused you to change this opinion?

HARCOURT
I don't believe so.

Doctor, did you ask to make an
examination of the defendant?

HARCOURT
No sir.

PAUL
Did the attorneys for the people petition
for such an examination in your behalf?

HARCOURT
No sir.

PAUL
So your opinion boils down to a snap
judgment, doesn't it?

HARCOURT
No. It is as careful a judgment as the
circumstances permit.

PAUL
Dr. Smith's opinion was made under
better circumstances, wasn't it?

HARCOURT
If you mean that he was able to examine
the man, yes.

PAUL
Thank you, Doctor.

DANCER
Doctor, upon what do you base your
opinions?

HARCOURT
Upon the findings of other doctors
and largely upon’my own years of
study and analysis.

DANCER
Are those many years?

HARCOURT
Over thirty years.

You were working in this field probably
before Dr. Smith was born, weren't you?

You're a liar. You're a lousy,

stinking liar!!

The Judge raps for order. Paul draws Manion back into his seat.

PAUL
I apologize for my client, Your Honor.
Yet, his outburst is almost excusable
since the prosecution has seen fit to
put a felon on the stand to testify against
an officer in the United States Army.

DANCER

worse offender -- Manion or his
lawyer...

JUDGE ‘WEAVER

MITCH
(sheepishly)
Yes sir, here it is.

Mitch produces several cards clipped together. Paul strides to the
prosecution table, takes the cards, flips through them.

PAUL
Mr. Miller, this record shows you've
been in prison six times in three different
states. You've been in three times for
arson, twice for assault with a deadly
weapon, once for larceny. It also shows
you've done short stretches in four city
jails for the charges of indecent exposure,
window peeping, perjury, and committing
a public nuisance. Is this your true
record?

MILLER
Well, them things never are right.

Paul stalks back to the prosecution table, angrily tosses the record on
the table. Mitch is embarrassed, but Dancer is imperturbable, as

usual.

PAUL
Mr, Miller, how did-you.get the ear of

Manion?

the stand. Manion locks to Paul for help.

DANCER
Your attorney can't answer the question .
for you, Lieutenant Manion. Did you
ever physically attack Miller?

MANION
I don't think you could call it an attack.
I pushed his head against the bars one
day.

DANCER
Why?

MANION

DANCER
Do you clearly remember pushing or
bumping his head against the bars?

How many times did you talk to Mr.
Biegler?

MARY
Twice,

DANCER
When was the last time?

MARY
Last night.

Dancer glances significantly at Paul, quickens the pace of his
interrogation,

DANCER
Have you now changed your mind
about Barney Quill? Do you now
believe he raped Mrs. Manion?

MARY
I -- I don't know now, I think he
might have.

DANCER
When did you change your mind --
was it last night?

MARY
No -- I-- it was here, this morning.

DANCER

When were you given the panties? Was

it last night?

PAUL
Now wait a minute -- just wait a
minute...

JUDGE WEAVER
Use the proper form of objection,
Mr. Biegler.

QQ. PAUL
On second thought I don't object,
Your Honor, I'd like the jury to hear
her answer;

JUDGE WEAVER
Witness may answer,

MARY
No,.I was not given the panties last
night or any other time. I found them,
exactly like I said.

DANCER
Do you know for a fact Barney Quill
dropped the panties in the laundry
chute or did you just assume it?

MARY
,l assumed it.

DANCER
Had you thought that perhaps someone
else might have dropped them there?
Someone who wanted them found in
the hotel laundry? .

MARY
I hadn't thought about that.

Q

DANCER
And in the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call dissociative reaction you
rushed in here with the panties because
you wanted to crucify the character of
the dead Barney Quill -- isn't that
right?

MARY
No, I felt it was my duty to...

DANCER
Your pride was hurt, wasn't it?

MARY |
I don't know what you mean,

PAUL
Your honor, he's trying to confuse
the witness. Let him ask questions
that she can understand,

107 CONTINUED: (13)

JUDGE WEAVER
Yes, Mr. Dancer -- I'd like to know
what you're getting at myself.

DANCER
When you found the panties, Miss Pilant,
was your first thought that Quill might
have raped Mrs, Manion -- or was it
that he might have been stepping out
with Mrs, Manion?

MARY
{to the Judge)
What does he mean? I don't know
what he means,

‘ JUDGE WEAVER
Mr. Dancer, I must again ask you to
put straight questions to the witness.

—_ DANCER

This is a straight question, Your Honor.
Were you Barney Quill's mistress,
Miss Pilant?

MARY
(almost weeping
with fury)
No, no, I was not!

DANCER
Do you know that it's common knowledge
in Thunder Bay that you were living
with Quill?

MARY
That's not true. Barney Quill was -~

: DANCER
Was what, Miss Pilant?

She looks helplessly at Paul. There's nothing he can do,

DANCER
(continues)
Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?

MARY
(defiantly)
He was my father,

The courtroom whispers and mumbles. Dancer is stunned, He stares
at Mary for a long moment, then spins to glare at Paul. Paul plays

it straight, but he can't keep the triumphant glitter from showing in
his eyes. Dancer relaxes, A smile touches his lips, He inclines

his head in a tiny bow to Paul, ,

DANCER
No more questions, Your Honor,

PAUL
That's all for me, Your Honor.

JUDGE WEAVER
The witriess may step down,

Mary leaves the stand, bravely, head up, Paul escorts her to sit
beside Parnell and Maida. :

. JUDGE WEAVER

{continues)
We will recess for fifteen minutes ~~
after which we will hear the closing
arguments. I hope the attorneys will
be brief and to the point, If it's
possible, I would like to charge the
jury before nightfall. ‘

As the Judge is speaking, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to take in all
of the courtroom,

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PAUL'S OFFICE ~ NIGHT

Paul is at the piano, aimlessly tinkering with some slow blue notes.
Parnell lies on the old couch, hat over his face. Maida comes from.
the kitchen, carrying a cup.of coffee, surveys the two men, comes. on
to peer through squinted eyes‘at the clock on Paul's desk. It reads
one o'clock,

MAIDA
Think they're going to stay out all
night? *
(a pause)
Why can't somebody say something?

PARNELL
(lifting the hat off
his face a few inches)
What shall I talk about, Maida
darling?

(CONTINUED)
198.
108 CONTINUED:

MAIDA
Tell me we're going to win. I'm
counting on getting that promissory
note from the Lieutenant. Ihope we
can borrow some money on it. I need
a new typewriter. Half the time the
‘p' and the 'f' won't strike on mine.
‘Party of the first part! sometimes
comes out, ‘arty o' the irst art. '
it doesn't make sense. It's embarrassing.

PAUL
Arty o' the ‘irst art, I like that.
It has a ring to it.

A moment passes,

PARNELL

(puts his hat

over his eyes)
Twelve people go off into a room.
Twelve different hearts, twelve
different minds, from twelve
different walks of life -- twelve
sets of eyes and ears, shapes and
sizes -- And these twelve people
have to judge another human being
as different from them as they are
from each other -- and in their
judgment they must become of one
mind <= unanimous, It's one of the
miracles of man's disorganized soul
that they can do it -- and most of
the time do it right well, God
bless juries.

A little time passes. Paul picks at the keyboard, Maida sips her
coffee. : .

MAIDA
I don't know what I'd do if I were on
that jury. I really dont know. Do

you?

PARNELL
(chuckles)
I loved that, Polly, my boy. I loved
that humble country lawyer bit. You
had Mr. Dancer dancing.

PAUL
I'm afraid he got the last dance --
best summary I've ever heard in a
courtroom,

MAIDA
I liked yours much better, Polly.

PARNELL
Do you have to play that stuff? Can't
you play Danny Boy or Sweet Isle of
Innisfree?

Paul boogies Danny Boy and Parnell rises irately.
PARNELL

(continue s)
Sacrilege! ~ —_—

 

The RING of the phone cuts into the racket Paul is making at the
piano. He stops playing suddenly. He and Parnell turn toward
Maida who has seized the phone,

MAIDA
(into phone)
Paul Biegler's office... Yes sir.
Right away.
(she hangs up)
They're ready,

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT, COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

The upper floor, the courtroom floor, is ablaze with light. The lawn
is deserted, There are maybe fifteen cars parked in the street.

A water truck passes by spraying the pavement. As the truck passes
itis joined by Paul's car which turns into-the curb before the court-
house. Paul, Maida and Parnell hurry up the walk toward the
entrance,

INT, COURTHOUSE ROTUNDA - NIGHT

The rotunda is dimly illuminated by a few lights in the corridors off
the rotunda, Light from above touches the marble stairs and from
above Laura's voice is heard murmuring a plaintive song -- off key --
lazy. She is preceded by Muff -- flashlight in mouth, bouncing down
the stairs. As Laura comes into view, Paul, Maida and Parnell
enter the courthouse. Laura sees them and halts, leaning against the
stair wall. She carriesher shoes in her hand, her suit jacket is
unbuttoned. She's pleasantly tight, careless and appealing.

Hi, sweetie.
PAUL

They go on up, looking back suspiciously at tipsy Laura.

PAUL
(continues)
The jury's coming in,

LAURA
(she hiccups)
Iheard, Tell my loving husband I'L
be waiting in the car.

PAUL
You're sure he'll be coming out?

LAURA
(putting on her shoes)
Sure. He's lucky. Some people have
all the luck. Tell him I'm waiting to
get kicked to kingdom come,

She meanders on down the stairs for a few steps.

LAURA
(continues)
’ Oh, hey sweetie...
(she opens her purse,
takes out a folded
object, tosses it to Paul)
Souvenir for you,

The object in Paul's hand is a girdle.

PAUL
(stepping down, hands
her the girdle)
Better keep it. You might need it
again sometime, You never know.

: LAURA
No, you don't, do you? I like you,
Polly.

A beat, then she smiles and dawdles on, murmuring her song again,
crosses the rotunda. Muff playing about her in circles, Paul watches
her go with pity, amusement and affection.

INT, COURTROOM ~- NIGHT

The wall clock reads 1:30. Only a few spectators have kept vigil but
the newspapermen are, of course, still on hand, Mitch and Dancer
are chatting with a couple of reporters and the court officials are
lounging about inside the bar. There is a patter of conversation and
air of expectancy. Manion enters with Sheriff Battisfore from the
lawyers' conference room, As Paul enters the courtroom through the
main doors and walks down the center aisle, Judge Weaver comes
from his chambers, The courtroom comes to attention as the Judge
climbs to his bench, He glances up at the clock, checking it against

his watch,
. JUDGE WEAVER
You may be seated. Is everyone present,
Mr. Sheriff?
SHERIFF
Yes sir. All the principals are present.

 

"JUDGE WEAVER =
Allow the jury to come in please.

Sheriff Battisfore opens the door to the jury room, saying, "All
right, folks, '' and the jury files in, tired, rumpled, the men
needing shaves,

JUDGE WEAVER

(continues; when the

jury is seated)
I warn all of these present not to
interrupt the taking of the verdict.
I will stop the proceedings and
clear the courtroom if there is
any demonstration, Proceed,

Paul's car comes speeding along the road by the lake which leads

to Thunder Bay. The sun is bright and it's a good day.

113 INT. PAUL'S CAR - DAY

Paul is driving, Parnell beside him, Both are mellow and pleased.

PAUL
Maida gave you the promissory note,
didn't she?

PARNELL

(tapping his

coat pocket)
Right here -~ ready to be signed by
our happy client.

{lie looks out

the window)
You know, I used to think the world
looked better through a glass of rye.
It doesn't, I think I'll keep it this
way. Looks nice.

PAUL
I've gotten one good thing out of this
case -- that's a law partner -- if it's
all right with him,

PARNELL
(delighted)
He'll be mighty proud to have his
name on a shingle with yours,

They grin at each other.

Paul's car hums from down the highway, turns through the gate.

203,
EXT, SITE OF MANION'S TRAILER - DAY

A littered clearing, waste paper blowing about the area, a canvas
chair with a broken back has been left behind, a big oil drum serves
as a garbage can and is overflowing with cans and empty bottles.
Paul's car rolls up and stops, Paul and Parnell get out. Paul walks
slowly to where the trailer once stood, looks about in dismay. Mr.
Lemon comes hurrying down from the trailer street,

LEMON
I guess you're looking for Lieutenant
Manion, aren't you,. Mr. Biegler?

PAUL
Yes.

LEMON
He gave me this note for you.

Paul takes the note, reads it silently.

LEMON
Felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion,
She was crying, Left a mess, didn't
they? I better get my helper busy
here.

He trots away. Without a word Paul hands Parnell the note and for
lack of something else to do, idles over toward the oil drum. Parnell
scans the note. Now he reads aloud.

PARNELL
(reading) ©
'Dear Mr. Biegler: So sorry but
Ihad to leave suddenly. I was seized
by -- an irresistible impulse.
Frederick Manion, '

The wind rustles through the littered camp site. Paul reaches into
the oil drum and lifts out a red slipper with a spike heel. The heel
has been broken and dangles from its joint. He sets the heel into
Place, holds the slipper on the palm of his hand.

PAUL
How the devil are we going to face
Maida?
PARNELL
{picking up an
empty bottle)

Gin. I knew there was something
wrong with that fellow. Never saw
a gin drinker you could trust.

Q PAUL
Pardner, let's go see our first client.

PARNELL
And who might that be?

PAUL
(grinning)
Mary Pilant, We're going to administer
- Barney Quill's estate,

PARNELL
(chuckles)
That's what I call poetic justice for
everybody.

A little sadly, Paul drops the red slipper on top of the bottles.

- PAUL.
Yes,

They get into the car and drive away. Now they're gone and all that
remains -- the last dismembered part <- is the broken red slipper
lying among the empty bottles,

FADE OUT.
