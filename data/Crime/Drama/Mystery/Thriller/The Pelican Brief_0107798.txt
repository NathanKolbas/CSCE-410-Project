THE PELICAN BRIEF
The SCREEN is BLANK,

THE FIRST SOUNDS: Epithets and SCREAMS of hate, a
CACOPHONY of fury.

FADE IN:
FIRST IMAGE

Whites, Blacks, Browns, Indians, Women, Gays, Tree
Lovers, Christians, Abortion Activists, Nazis, Atheists,
Hunters, Animal Lovers, Farmers, heckling, chanting,
Screaming, fighting.

The CAMERA, low, like a child, ZIGZAGS THROUGH this sea
of rage TO an unyielding line of Police, and BURSTS
THROUGH their outstretched clubs, TO REVEAL, like some
mirage above, the Supreme Court, FRAMED AGAINST the sky.

OLD MAN (V.0.)
Any of those signs got my name
on ‘em?

INT. SUPREME COURT OFFICE - DAY

JUSTICE ROSENBERG, an ancient man, sits in a wheelchair,.
watching through a window. GRAY GRANTHAM, a mid-
thirtyish journalist, stands beside hin.

GRANTHAM
Quite a few.

ROSENBERG
What do they say?

GRANTHAM
The usual. Death to Rosenberg.
Retire Rosenberg. Cut off the
oxygen.

ROSENBERG
(chuckling) .
That's my favorite.
(squinting at
Grantham)
Of course, you did pretty good by
me your last time out: ‘Rosenberg
equals government over business,
the individual over government,
the environment over everything.

ROSENBERG (CONT'D)
And the Indians, give 'em whatever

they want.'

GRANTHAM
That wasn't my line, sir. It was
a quote.

ROSENBERG

From one of your unnamed Senior
White House Officials. Senior
White House son of a bitch you
should have said! Got in there
by whipping up these people, one
against the other. Never fails
to amaze me what a man will do to
get an oval office.

GRANTHAM
There's a report, sir, that your
doctor is urging you to resign.

8 rheumy, old eyes look straight up at

Grantham's.

ROSENBERG

Son, the present senior White
House official is not appointing
my successor, if I have to have
my mummy sittin’ on the bench.
I’m going to sit here in this
wheelchair and gasp my oxygen and
Protect the Indians, the blacks,
the women, the poor, the
handicapped and the environment --

“Oh, yes, and let's not forget The

Constitution. And only the Senior
Official in the Sky can do one
damned thing about it.

younger.

CALLAHAN
On what should be our most
cherished day, the day the
Supreme Court of our land goes
into session, what is happening
te our Founding Fathers’ dream.
Abortion clinics bombed, doctors
attacked and beaten, gays
attacked by people who dare call
themselves Christians, churches
attacked by militant gays, white
Supremacists attacking Blacks,
Hispanics, Asians. America's
favorite pastime now is hate.

INT. LAW SCHOOL CLASS - CLOSE ON DARBY SHAW - DAY

An attractive young girl. She looks at her professor
with pride and admiration.

CALLAHAN (V.0.)
This is the country ble d with
the greatest gift of governance
bestowed on any peoples: The
Constitution. It's an appropriate
day to be exploring a dissenting
opinion of Justice Rosenberg, the
last of the great judicial
activists.

 

The sound of the SEA washes over her. And then a muffled
ENGINE HUM. The HUM grows LOUDER.

EXT. COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA - NIGHT

A small craft floats in the direction of the pier, a
camouflaged silhouette crouching low, working the motor
The HUM stops. The craft stalls thirty feet from the
pier.

Lucky Strike.

 
 

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

The old man climbs in on the driver's side. The other
door opens and a black Adidas gym bag is thrown onto the
seat. The man from the boat climbs in beside it. He has
a heavy beard, dark glasses, and wears a black turtleneck.
He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes. They have an
intensity we won't forget.

EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAWN

The truck stops at the corner of Thirty-First and M

Streets in Georgetown. The man from the boat grabs his
gym bag and hits the sidewalk.

EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL (WASHINGTON D.C.) - EARLY

CAMERA PANS UP TO the Man as he picks up the envelope
and opens it.

There is a memorandum and a key inside.

He walks to the room next door. A copy of i

A formal photograph of the Supreme Court Justices above a
story about the first day of its new session. The story
is by Gray Granthan. :

The caption below the Photograph identifies the youngish

man next to Rosenberg as Justice Jensen. The subheading
of the story is: JENSEN THE WILDCARD.

CLOSE SHOT - MAN FROM BOAT

Reading. A mischievous smile crosses his face.
EXT. ROSENBERG HOUSE - NIGHT
A Glce Ceorgetown House.

A plainclothes man sits outside the house. CAMERA MOVES
PAST him TO a lighted window on the ground floor, and
then MOVES THROUGH the window.

INT. ROSENBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Justice Rosenberg is asleep in a special hospital bed. A
male nurse lowers the lights and draws the drapes.

He sits down in a chair, reaches for a mouse, and turns
ON the TELEVISION. He flicks the channels until he comes
to "STUDS": Women and men telling semi-prurient tales
about their dating.

CAMERA MOVES INTO the face of the male nurse, intent. on
the program; a closet door in back of him inches open.

The nurse's face breaks into a delighted smile at some
lewd comment.

The tip of a gun APPEARS ON the SIDE OF the SCREEN next
to his head. The smile freezes; his face falls OUT OF
FRAME. A dull thud as the head hits the floor.

CAMERA PANS OVER TO the old justice on the bed. Blood
trickles from his mouth, his eyes closed now in eternal
sleep.

EXT. ROSENBERG HOUSE - BACK DOOR - NIGHT

Door opens Stealthily. A man in running shorts and
Reeboks,’ clean-shaven, short blond hair under a cap,
slides out.

EXT. GEROGETOWN BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

The man runs TOWARDS CAMERA. He stops for a moment to
look back. He turns back TO CAMERA, his eyes fill the
Screen, the eyes of the man from the boat. An instant,
and he’s gone.

CAMERA HOLDS ON the alley. No sound except from the TV
set of a neighboring house:

NEWSCASTER (V.0.)
The latest polls do not look good
for the President. With the
first primaries just months away,
his approval rating continues on
its downward spiral.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER TICKET BOOTH (WASHINGTON, D.C.) -
CLOSEUP - TICKET - NIGHT

AS a male hand scoops it up.

INT. MOVIE THEATRE - SPARSELY-FILLED BALCONY
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) - NIGHT

All men. The ecstatic all-male GROANS and GRUNTS that
emanate from the sceen indicate the kind of film that
holds their interest,

A man in a fedora and sunglasses walks down the aisle
and sits in @ corner, away from the others. He takes off
the hat and sunglasses revealing a face we saw in the
picture in the Post: Justice Jensen, the wild card of
the Court.

A bag of popcorn falls INTO VIEW ABOVE his head, as some-
one sits down in the seat above.

CAMERA PANS. UP TO the bag of popcern sitting on a tight-
jeaned lap. A strand of yellow nylon ski rope is wrapped
like a belt from around the waist.

A familiar dark-complected hand reaches into the bag of
popcorn. CAMERA FOLLOWS the popcorn-filled hand TO the
new man’s face. He sports an earring, horn-rimmed
shades, and a mustache. CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE SHOT
of his eyes, the eyes of the man from the boat. :

CAMERA MOVES DOWN WITH the man's hand as it reaches down
to the popcorn bag again. This time the hand goes under
the popcorn bag and pulls the strand of yellow nylon ski
rope from his waist.

CAMERA PANS DOWN TO Jensen's face below, fixated on the
Screen and the magnified sounds of lust.

The nylon rope loops just under his larynx with a violent
wrench. The rope yanks downward, snapping the head over
the back of the seat. The neck breaks cleanly.

CAMERA PANS UP TO the seat above. It is empty.

CLOSE SHOT - LAMINATED WHITE HOUSE PASS

An I.D. photograph of an old black man; next to his name,

A.M.

WIDE ANGLE - OVAL OFFICE - VERY EARLY MORNING

The President sits behind his desk. COAL, his Chief of
Staff, faces him.

COAL
His nurse was also murdered.
Jensen was found in some queer
club two hours later. Voyles
called me, wildly uspet. This is
hardly good for the reputation of
the F.B.I. He and Gminski are on
the way.

PRESIDENT
Gminski?

COAL

"| The C.I.A. should be included, at
least for now. I[ Suggest you
address the nation in a couple of
hours. We have to wait ‘til
daylight, at least seven, if we
want an audience. A coat and
tie at 7 A.M. may seem-a bit
rehearsed. How about a cardigan?

PRESIDENT
You want me to address the
nation in this hour of crisis in
a sweater?

COAL
It's Rally Round the Leader time.
Your approval ratings will go
through the roof.

preliminary list of nominees.
The restructuring of the court
will be your legacy.

VOYLES and GMINSKI enter.

PRESIDENT
Any suspects?

VOYLES
Too early. We'll have
ballistics and autopsies by
late this afternoon.

PRESIDENT
I would like a report on your
security and where it broke
down.

VOYLES
You're assuming it broke down,
Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

We have two dead judges, both of
whom were being protected by the
F.B.I.

(turning to

Gminski)
Bob, I wans a straight answer.
Are these killings in any way
linked to any agency, operation,

"| group, whatever, of the United

States Government?

GMINSKI
I'm shocked you would even think
it.

PRESIDENT
Rosenberg did not believe in
mational security. He made
thousands of enemies in
intelligence. Just check it
out, okay.

GMINSKI
Okay.

(CONTINUED )

COAL
IT suggest we meet here at five
this afternoon, gentlemen. Is
that agreeable?

Gminski and Voyles nod.

EARLY MORNING

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO a FULL SHOT of her, snuggled against
the sleeping figure of Callahan.

From French doors opening onto a balcony of a TV set
across the courtyard:

ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
Ladies and gentlemen, the
President of the United States.

Darby opens her eyes, reaches over to the bedside table
for the mouse and TURNS ON the TELEVISION.

DARBY'S POV - TELEVISION SET ACROSS FROM BED

The President sits behind the desk in a brown cardigan
with no tie.

. DARBY (0.S.)
Thomas! Wake up!

CLOSE SHOT - DARBY AND CALLAHAN

Callahan sits up, rubbing his eyes. He has all the
symptoms of a man with a hangover.

PRESIDENT (V.0.)
Last night, a night that like
Pearl Harbor, shall live in
infamy, Supreme Court Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen were
assassinated.

CALLAHAN
Cheartbroken)
Rosenberg? Murdered?
11.
DARBY AND CALLAHAN'S POV - TELEVISION SCREEN - DAY

PRESIDENT (V.0.)
I can assure each and every
American that everything is being
and will be done to bring the
culprit or culprits to justice.

EXT. BALCONY OUTSIDE CALLAHAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Callahan and Darby, now dressed, are having coffee.

CALLAHAN
Half a lifetime later and we're
back in Dallas.

DARBY
Obviously, someone or some group
wants a different court. The
election is next year. A
president at least halfway closer
to the center may be elected
President. Why take a chance on
his nominations? Kill them now,
a year before the election.

CALLAHAN
But why Jensen? He was nominated
by this administration. In most
issues, he is one hundred and
eighty degrees from Rosenberg.
. (rising)
I need a bloody mary.

DARBY
Don't you think you had enough
*, last night?

CALLAHAN
I can not bear to look at this
world sober.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER TO Darby's, face, frustrated and
concerned.

The Man In The Boat.

VOYLES (V.0.)
Whoever did the actual killings
was fed a lot of information.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

The President is having his 5:00 P.M. with Gminski,
Coal, and a miserable-locking Voyles.

PRESIDENT
Such as?

VOYLES
Such as that Jensen had become
expert at avoiding F.B.I.
protection, and that Rosenberg
had refused a security system
in his house, and kept our boys
outside.

COAL
You're Suggesting a conspiracy.

PRESIDENT
Then who are the conspirators?
Who are your suspects?

VOYLES
| This must be kept very quiet.

COAL
Of course it's confidential.
You're in the Oval Office.

Voyles gives Coal a look that Says, "And you know
that's the problem.”

VOYLES
We know of at least eleven members
of the Underground Army who've
been in the D.C. area for a week.
We suspect them in at least a
hundred bombings of abortion
clinies, A.C.L.U. offices, porno
houses, gay clubs, all over the
country.

GMINSKI
The truth is you don't have a
Prime suspect at the moment, just
a few good possibilities.
PRESIDENT
You mean we may never know who did
it.

agnostics, and the perverted,

A group of reporters sitting around a table in a show
like Washington Week in Review. Gray Grantham is among

ANCHOR (V.0.)
Today that evangelist issued a
Statement saying Rosenberg's death
was God's will. And there were a
lot of people who felt that way.

hours before he died, that the

divisive...

INT. CALLAHAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Callahan is sitting in front of the TV with a drink. The
door opens and Darby enters.

We'll return, after a message.

CALLAHAN
(muting the TV sound)
Where've you been? It's almost
midnight.

DARBY
The library. I studied a printout
of the Supreme Court docket. Tr

even made a list of possible

Suspects, and threw it in the
garbage because they'd be obvious
to anyone. And then I looked for
areas that Jensen and Rosenberg
might have in common. Jensen --
with some notable exceptions --
was generally consistent in his
protection of the rights of
criminal defendants, he has
written three majority opinions
strongly protective of the
environment, and he was near
perfect in support of tax
Protestors. Have you eaten?

CALLAHAN
In @ liquid sort of way. How
about a drink?

YY

/ DARB'
Why don't I make us both some

tea?

CALLAHAN
That's my girl. Always trying to
set a good example.

(rising)
I'll stick with bourbon.

DARBY
Everyone's assuming the motive is
hatred or revenge, or an attempt
to influence the social agenda of
the Court. But what if the issues
involve old-fashioned material
greed? A case that involves a
great deal of money.

C.
(pouring his bourbon)
Do you realize that every little
legal scholar in the country is
doing exactly what you're doing?

DARBY
If there are enough of us, maybe
one of us is going to get lucky.

CALLAHAN
As for me, I'm canceling classes
for a week. The gifts of reason
are puny weapons in the face of
such brutality.

DARBY
That's not what you taught me.

Callahan turns ON the SOUND again.

ANCHOR (V.0.)
Let's explore what kind of
justices the President will select
to replace them. For background,
we have a piece on his campaign
oratory of three years ago.

VERHEEK
Coal blasted the director this

CALLAHAN
That bastard ran the most divisive
campaign in twenty years, and the
President acted as if it wasn't
happening.

VERHEEK
The President doesn’t know the half
of what he does, and Coal telis
him that's essential, to protect
his deniability.

What is it?

CALLAHAN

It's sort of a brief. Darby wrote
it, my girl. She's a brilliant
student, with a passion for
constitutional law.

VERHEEK
Sounds like a fellow I knew at
law school.

CALLAHAN

She took off four days last week

We can't control his investigation.

COAL
I think you should ask Gminski

Gray hangs up and runs out the door.
The TELEPHONE RINGS. Gray comes back in and picks it up.

GARCIA (V.0.)
I can't go through with it.

Grantham falls back into a chair in frustration.

GARCIA (V.0.)
I have a wife and little daughter.
There's a chance they know that I
know. They've been treating me
funny.

GRANTHAM .
These are the guys in your firm?

GARCIA (V.0.)
Yeah. No. Wait. How'd you know
Iwas in a firm? I haven't told
you that.

GRANTHAM
You go to work too early to be a
government lawyer. You're in one
of those firms where they expect
' the associates and junior partners
to work a hundred hours a week.

He hears the CLICK of Garcia HANGING UP. Gray bangs the

phone down in disgust. He whirls around in his chair and
finds himself facing a mirror.

GRANTHAM

mirror)
You know better than to frighten
a@ source. Fuckhead!

Shit? Is this Gray Grantham with
the Washington Post?
GRANTHAM
It is.
DARBY (V.0.)
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?
GRANTHAM

The Pelican Brief. No. What is it?

DARBY (V.0.)
It's an unlikely little theory
about who killed Rosenberg and
Jensen. It was taken to
Washington last week by a man
named Thomas Callahan, a
professor of law at Tulane. He
gave it to a friend with the
F.B.1I., and it was passed around.
Callahan was killed in a car bomb
' Wednesday night in New Orleans.

He turns on the lamp and starts to scribble on his pad.

GRANTHAM
How de you know all this?

DARBY (V.0.)
I wrote the brief.

GRANTHAM
Are you a lawyer?

DARBY (V.0.)
No.

GRANTHAM

Are you calling from New Orleans?

GRANTHAM
I can have it by this afternoon.

And you know who's done the
killing?
DARBY (V.0.)
Yes.
GRANTHAM
I'm not going to beat around the
bush. Who?

touch.
GRANTHAM

But she has hung up.
He puts down the phone and stares at his pad.

Next to "Not a lawyer,” he scribbles, "A student?”
He draws the oval outline of a woman's face. The inside

DARBY
Of course it was luck. Bad luck,
it now turns out. T remembered a
piece "Frontline" did about a
year ago. They interviewed the
young lawyer who originally filed
the suit. They said, that since
the interview, he had committed
suicide, although his family
insisted it was foul play. After
the assassinations I called his
family. They said he'd had 2
depressive problem years before,
but that he'd been fine since
taking medication. His doctors
confirmed everything the family
said. They told the police they
were convinced that it was not 4&
suicide.

investigation.

CONTRIBUTORS, contains a photograph of a beaming Presi-
dent shaking hands with a big, distinguished- looking
gray-haired man. The caption reads: Happy President and
Oil Tycoon Friend, Victor Mattiece.

DARBY (V.0.)
He's made and lost several
fortunes drilling for oil in
south Louisiana.

CAMERA MOVES INTO a CLOSER SHOT of the two beaming faces.

DARBY (V.0.)

"| In 1979, his oil company punched
some holes in Terrebonne Parish
and hit oil. A lot of oil. He
capped the wells before word
leaked out...

CAMERA PANS OVER the photograph TO a CLOSEUP SHOT of
the President's beaming face. :

DARBY (V.0.)
.». And bought the surrounding
land under a myriad of corporate
names. He knew he'd need
government permission to dredge
a channel through the marshlands
to get the equipment in and the

oil out.

DARBY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Entec Mattiece, the Great
Campaign Contributor, and, as
night must follow day, government
permission to gouge through the
endangered marshes.

CAMERA PANS OVER the photograph to a CLOSEUP SHOT of
Mattiece's beaming face.

DARBY (V.0.)
Mattiece is that close to at least
a billion: dollars, when Green Fund,
an obscure environmental outfit,
trots on down to the U.S. District
court in Lafayette, and files a
lawsuit to stop the entire
operation. A federal judge halts
the project pending a trial on ail
issues. Of course Mattiece spares
no expense to win the lawsuit. I
don't think there's a top law firm
between Houston and New Orleans
that at some point he hasn't hired.

CLOSE SHOT - COAL

Studying the buddy-buddy picture of Mattiece and the
President. His face is a study in agony.

+ DARBY (V.0.)
By the time the Green Fund
lawyers, -- all two of them --
wade in, the joint ventures, limited
‘| partnerships and corporate
associations form an impenetrable
maze that make Mattiece invisible.

Coal removes the photograph and studies the papers
underneath.
HIS POV - COAL'S WHITE HOUSE OFFICE - DAY

INSERT of the papers in the file. A series of Louisiana
newspaper clippings about the lawsuit and the trial.

: DARBY (V.O.
Luckily for Green Fund's 1 ewauit,
the heart of the new oil reserve
is near a natural refuge for
waterflow. Osprey, egrets,
pelicans, ducks, cranes, geese.

Coal removes the clippings to reveal a video cassette
of a "Frontline" telecast titled: Oil vs. The Louisiana
Pelican

CLOSE SHOT - COAL
looking at the "Frontline" cassette.

COAL
(to himself)
Fucking P.B.S.!

He pushes the cassette aside.

, DARBY (V.0.)
The pelican becomes the hero.
After thirty years of
contamination by D.D.T. and other
pesticides, the Louisiana brown
pelican perches on the brink of
extinction. Green Fund seizes
the majestic bird, and enlists
experts from around the country
to testify on its behalf.

COAL’S WHITE HOUSE OFFICE - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - NIGHT

Coal gets up and paces up and down his office, trying
to develop some kind of plan.

DARBY (V.0.)
It takes seven years for the
Pelican Suit to go to trial in
Lake Charles. The three man jury,
about the pelican than
jobs, votes in favor of Mattiece.

  

Coal looks at his watch.

It reads 12:30 A.M.

CONTINUED:

DANTY (¥.0.)

But the judge rules to keep the
injunction against drilling in
place because he thinks Green Fund
has proven its point about the
pelican, a federally protected
species, and it's apparent that
Green Fund will appeal.

INT. VAN (WASHINGTON) - ANOTHER MAN'S WATCH - NIGHT
It reads 12:31 A.M.

GRANTHAM (V.0.)
‘What's the status of the lawsuit?

CAMERA PANS UP TO the man's face. It is one of the men
we saw bugging the phone in Gray's car. He looks out
the window of the van.

DARBY (V.0.)
From the trial level it will be
appealed to the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Orleans
in about a month.

DARBY (V.0.)
If either side is unhappy with
the Fifth Circuit, they can appeal
to the Supreme Court.

THE SOUND OF A WINDOW BEING JIMMED OPEN...

The CAMERA PANS AROUND, FOLLOWING the sound. It arrives
at the window just after it has been opened. The curtains
blow but no one is there.

GRANTHAM (V.0.)
From today, how long would it take
for the case to be decided by the
Supreme Court?

The figure of the first man climbs through the window.
And then the second.

DARBY (V.0.)
Anywhere from three to five years.

CAMERA FOLLOWS the two men as they check the apartment.

GRANTHAM (V.0.)
Rosenberg would have died from
natural causes.

DARBY (V.0.)
Yes, but another President could be
in the White House when he died.

The two men stop at the phone in Gray's apartment.

DARBY (V.0.)
So, if you're Victor Mattiece, and
you don't mind killing a couple of
Supremes, now is the time to take
him out, when you can predict his
replacement.

GRANTHAM
A lawyer in D.C. called me, said
he saw something concerning
Rosenberg and Jensen. We were
supposed to meet, but he bombed
out, and I haven't heard from him
again. He gave me a phoney name,
but I got his picture.

DARBY
How?

GRANTHAM
That's another story. If he works
for either of those firms, he could
be our confirmation.

DARBY
I hope you find him.

GRANTHAM
Darby, come with me to Washington.
I need your heip.

DARBY ~
Of course you do. If I disappear,
you may not have a story. But I
might have a life.

GRANTHAM
If you're right about Mattiece,
there'll be a coverup, and the
odds are it'll work. Oh, there'll
be a cottage industry of books
and articles and movies about the
assassinations -- as there was with

“Kennedy's: But no one will be

prosecuted,
DARBY
Why are you so sure?
GRANTHAM .

T checked the Post morgue last
night. On Mattiece. Two years
ago we ran a big, fat, front
page picture of the President
with his arm around Mattiece.
He contributed the absolute top

DARBY
It didn't work with Watergate.

GRANTHAM
Oh, Darby. Don't you know that for
every Watergate that comes to light,
there are more that never surface?
The word goes out and suddenly
things that happened didn't happen,
and evidence that was no longer is.
You will be the only witness to the
murders that connect the
assassinations to your Brief.
Disappear and so will justice. Is
that what Callahan would want?

DARBY

That was rented two weeks ago.
DARBY

Yes.
WOMAN

I assume you're Mrs. Morgan.

Of course.

The Woman takes a small box from the drawer, and walks
around the desk.

Follow me.

They go through the bronze doors.

He STARTS the CAR and speeds away.

She takes the envelope out of her purse and opens it.
She pulls out a document.

DARBY
(studying the document )
It's a four page affidavit, sworn
to under oath before a notary
public... It's dated Friday.

GRANTHAM
The day before his last phone call
to me.

DARBY
He's worked at White and Blazevich
in the oil and gas section for five
years. During that time, he worked
for a client who was engaged in a
huge lawsuit in south Louisiana.
The client was a man named Victor
Mattiece.

Darby looks at Gray. She doesn't know whether to laugh
or cry.

GRANTHAM
Keep going.

DARBY
(scanning the document)
Whom he'd never met... Lots about
the lawsuit and how much it meant
to Mattiece. How desperate he
was to win it.

GRANTHAM
It's as if you wrote it.

Gray yanks the gearshift into drive, and pulls the right
front wheel over the curb and onto the sidewalk.

DARBY

He took a bunch of files and
documents that Wakefield left
on his desk for him. Not related
to the case. When he got back to
his own office, he found a
handwritten memo on the bottom
of the stack of documents. He
had inadvertently taken it
from Wakefield's desk. A copy
of the memo is attached to the
affidavit.

He made a copy of the memo...

The memo was from M. Velmano, a

Gray and Darby are watching the tape, surrounded by the
top editors of the paper. :

There was no signature.

GRANTHAM AND EDITORS’ POV OF TV MONITOR - DAY

CURTIS MORGAN (V.0.)
After I copied it, I folded my
copy of the memo and placed it
in a desk drawer. Ten minutes
later, Wakefield stormed into
my office, very disturhed and
pale. He scratched around ay
desk, and found the memo. He
asked if I had read it. No, I
insisted. ‘Evidently, I
mistakenly picked it up when I
left your office,' I explained.
"I had no idea until you just
reached for it that it was there.’

Then Justices Rosenberg and Jensen
were killed. There is no doubt
in my mind it was the work of
Mattiece and his associates. The
memo does not mention Mattiece,
but it refers to a ‘client.’
Wakefield had no other clients.
And no one client had as much
to gain from a new court as
Mattiece. I don't know who will
see this tape. I'll be dead, so
it won’t really matter, I guess.
But if the sleazy lawyers are
watching this tape, then you can
all go straight to hell.

the F.B.I. knew about Mattiece
early on, but refused to

I am.

GRANTHAM (V.0.)
We're running a story which, in
summary, verifies the facts set
forth in that Brief. And we
have confirmed that Mr. Mattiece
contributed in excess of four
Giillion dollars to the President's
campaign three years ago.

COAL
‘ Four million, two hundred thousand,
all through legal channeis.

GRANTHAM (V.0.)
We also believe the White House
intervened and attempted to
obstruct the F.B.I. investigation
into Mr. Mattiece, and we wanted
your comment, if any.

The White House emphatically denies
any direct or indirect involvement
in any aspect of this investigation.
You have received some bad

His assistant enters. Coal motions him to shut the

VOYLES (V.0.)
First, we received a copy of the
Pelican Brief two weeks ago, and
submitted it to the White House
on the same day.

Coal goes over to the assistant. Both their BACKS ARE
TO THE CAMERA when Coal speaks. We do not hear what
they're saying.

VOYLES (V.0.)
But it was not considered high
priority in the investigation
until Mr. Gavin Verheek, Special
Counsel to The Director, was
found murdered in New Orleans.

The CAMERA COMES AROUND TO Coal's and the assistant's
faces. It is as if the assistant has been whiplashed.

VOYLES (V.0.)
At that time, the F.B.I1. immediately
began a full-scale investigation of
Victor Mattiece.

The assistant leaves the office, followed by Coal.

He's probably got twenty names.

part to protect.

Let's do it like this. I get on
the plane, and it's headed for
Denver. And no one is on it but
me, Gray, and the pilots. And
thirty minutes after we take off,

I instruct the pilot to go to, let's
say, Chicago. Can he do that?

VOYLES
He has to file a flight plan before
he leaves.

DARBY

You're the director of the F.B.I.,

I get off the plane alone, and it
