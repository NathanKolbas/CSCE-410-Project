INT. VILLAGE BAKERY - LATE MORNING

The front window of the coffee shop is covered in black
Sharpie writing. A sweaty, but very cute lesbian in an apron
scrubs a wet sponge over the writing. It's not going away.

SAM, 33, and trying not to appear so, wipes sweat from his
face and neck as he turns toward the bright sun. His hair is
uncombed and his clothes don't match in the appropriate ways.
He stands in a long line, waiting for coffee, behind beautiful
hipsters and a few old people - all in various stages of
perspiration.

"Never My Love" by the Association plays over the house
speakers. No one sings along.

Sam glances over at the front window, looking at the backwards
and inverted text across the glass. Poor penmanship, even for
graffiti. It says:

BEWARE THE DOG KILLER
The room is filled with chatter - potentially exciting but
probably inane talk of movies, music, art and crime. It's
impossible for us to decipher under the music.
Sam stares at one of the shop's many attractive, tattooed
bakery girls as she smiles to another customer. He glances
over and spies two other bakery girls in a private
conversation near the espresso machine.
Chatter. Chatter. Chatter. Chatter. Chatter. Chatter
So many unknowable things wrapped in beauty.
EXT. LOS FELIZ BOULEVARD - LATE MORNING

Sam sips his coffee and walks casually down the sidewalk
passing sad kittens in a pet shop window.

A street fruit vendor watches Sam from behind his glass fruit
case - oddly suspicious and grim.

Sam stops and looks up at a giant billboard across the street.
On it, a beautiful young Indian woman smiles - staring outward
through sparkling eyes.
A contact lens logo stretches below her face. The ad reads:

I Can See Clearly Now

Sam sighs and shakes his head, moving on.
EXT. RANCHO LOS FELIZ APARTMENTS - LATE MORNING

Sam walks alone, carrying his iced latte and LA Weekly through
the lush garden paths of his modest apartment complex.

We see his POV as he steps along a concrete trail surrounded
by carefully manicured shrubs, giant trees and a man-made
stream which flows alongside the walkway.

Sam passes a blue vested worker cleaning leaves from the pond
in a somnolent state. The man stares, as if in a heat-trance.

Turning a corner, Sam takes a sip of coffee through the straw

He hears a terrible rattle in the tree above him. Sam looks
up as the branches shake.

SAM
Ah!

Suddenly something with mass falls from the tree.
THUD!

A squirrel lands hard across the concrete walkway - on all
four paws - right before him.

Sam steps back, his breath leaving him for a second. The
momentary primal fear of seeing flesh impact with stone.

The animal looks at Sam then darts away into the bushes.

Sam smiles for a second, feeling stupid about displaying shock
publicly, especially over a squirrel. Looking around, there
are no obvious witnesses.

But there are so many apartments... so many windows... so many
balconies.

SAM
(laughing to himself)

Is that squirrel even ok?
EXT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - LATE MORNING
Sam reaches for his keys as he steps up to the door. There's a
note taped below his apartment number. He pulls it down and
reads it covertly.
It says:
"Your Rent is Seriously Overdue. You have 7 Days to PAY or be
EVICTED."

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

SAM
(under his breath)
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck you.

Sam crumples the paper in hand, fumbling to unlock the door
Hitting it open, he bangs his shoulder into the wood - the way
some people punch walls.

Ext. Sam'S APARTMENT balcony - late MORNING

Sam sits on a patio chair smoking a cigarette and finishing
his latte. A pair of binoculars hang from his neck.

Smoke drifts through the sliding screen door - a dim apartment
within. The cartoon thermometer suction-cupped to the glass
reads: 94 Degrees.

This little patio enclave is hidden by railing, low hanging
branches and thick shrubbery. It offers wonderful views of the
surrounding apartments and the community pool below.

Sam looks at the cover of the LA Weekly. It features a studio
photo of some local indie band. The headline reads:

East LA Resurrected... or Never Dead?
Who are Jesus and the Brides of Dracula?
According to the pic, Jesus is an emaciated hipster. His
brides are gorgeous but unique women in 1920's hand-stitched
gowns.
An unseen bird CAWS loudly.

Sam lifts and focuses his binoculars through the green foliage
of the neighboring balconies.

A beautiful middle-aged woman walks topless along her third
story patio. She feeds her caged birds as she struts toa
tinny-sounding jazz tune.

Sam’s cell phone rings. Peeking through the binoculars, he
answers.

SAM
Hi mom.

MOM
Hi honey. How are you?

The half-naked bird woman pets her parrot lovingly. Sam
cradles his cell phone against his ear - watching.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

SAM
I'm ok.

MOM
Good. Good. Are you at work?

The bird woman scratches her ass - unaware that she's being
checked out.

SAM
Yeah. It's kind of a busy day.

Sam rubs the stubble on his face - his eyes are tired.

MOM
Ok. Well I don't wanna keep you but I
hadn't heard from you in a bit...

SAM
I'm fine, mom.

MOM
Ok. I'm glad to hear that.

SAM
Yeah things are...

MOM
Oh, I wanted to tell you... Seventh
Heaven is playing on TCM tonight.

SAM
Mom, I don't have cable.

The topless woman walks inside - half visible through a shaded
window.

MOM
Oh shoot, that's too bad. It's a great
Janet Gaynor movie from 1927.

SAM
She's your favorite right?

Sam lowers his binoculars and takes another drag.
MOM
Janet Gaynor? Yes, since I was a
little girl. I've always admired her
So talented and beautiful.

Sam sighs staring out at the empty balconies and windows.

(CONTINUED)
4 CONTINUED: (3)

SAM
Well I should get back to work.

MOM
Ok. I'm giving you a big hug over the
phone.

SAM

Thanks. I love you.

The parrot caws again - something resembling words.

MOM

I love you. Have a good week.
SAM

Bye.
MOM

Bye.

Sam coughs and drops his cigarette into a cloudy yellow Evian
bottle.

Reflections of music draw near...

Common, but catchy indie-rock music approaches... growing
louder and louder.

A voice echoes through the surrounding courtyard. A tiny bell
rings.

SARAH
(0.S.)
Coca-Cola! Come on, you little soda
pop. It's swimming time.

Sam leans forward and looks down through the trees. He sees a
young woman in a bikini, SARAH, walking along the garden path -
a portable sound system in hand.

The music is louder and clearer now. It's the latest hit song
"Tongue & Teeth" by the indie-rock band Jesus and the Brides
of Dracula.

Holding the gate open, Sarah waits as her little dog, COCA-
COLA, follows her inside. A small bell on its collar rings and
dings as it scampers along the hot concrete.

Sarah's face is half covered by a white and frilly Easter-
style hat. Colored straw and soft pink ribbons.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (4)

The white, toy-like Bichon Frise barks and runs in circles
around the woman's legs. She smiles and nods at the animal,
finding a place for herself in the sun near the pool.

Sam looks through his binoculars at the girl as she removes
her hat.

Big stoned eyes.
Light freckled cheeks.
White skin on a California body.
She looks like a mid-western Monica Vitti with a hint of
Sharon Tate. A sex that induces an almost guttural reaction in
any man or woman within proximity. But the girl seems unaware
of her power.
SARAH
(in a girlish voice)
Coca-Cola. I knowww. You liiiike the
sun. Gooooood boy.

Sam watches her coddling the animal... stretching her long
body across a lounge chair in the sun.

He leans closer, peeping over the rim of the balcony - a
gentle grin forming on his face.

The song's chorus repeats loudly from the portable speaker:
You and I...
turning like teeth...
loving beneath...
the surface.
A neighboring balcony door slides open with a bang -
reverberating over the pool courtyard. Sam sees the topless

bird woman emerge from her apartment. A scowl on her face.

TOPLESS BIRD WOMAN
Can you please turn that down?!

Sarah nods, leans over and acts like she's turning the stereo
down - twisting her hand inches from the volume knob.

The song remains at its irritating volume.

Sarah looks up towards the topless woman's balcony and shrugs
her shoulders with a grin.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (5)

SARAH
That's as quiet as it gets!

TOPLESS BIRD WOMAN
Oh thanks a lot!

The topless bird woman shakes her head, waves her hand in
disgust and slams her sliding patio door closed. The bikini
girl laughs and giggles as she stands, lifting her toy dog
into the air - bell rattling.

The caged bird shouts once more. Some unrecognizable words.

Sarah smiles and bobs her shoulders to the beat - staring into
her dog's eyes.

SARAH
You looooove this song don't you?!

As she sways, Sam aims his binoculars at the young woman's
ass.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Someone pounds on Sam's front door

Sarah hears it, turns her head and looks straight into Sam’s
viewfinder.

Sam lowers the binoculars and scoots back from the balcony’s
edge - out of view.

Mouth slightly agape, Sarah stares up through the over-growth,
turning her head and squinting for another glimpse of the
phantom face and lens.

Sam crawls inside his apartment, staying low to the carpet.

Bang! Bang! The mystery visitor continues to pound on Sam's
front door.

From a stooped position on the floor, Sam pulls the blinds
closed.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Sam opens the front door...

Standing in the hallway is a pockmarked brunette in a German
dirndl. The ACTRESS holds a bag of carry-out over her
otherwise exposed cleavage.

The thirty-something actress is pretty from the right angle -

the physical traits of someone who's had a brief bout with
meth addiction. Something is just a bit off.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
SAM
Hey.
ACTRESS
Hi.
Sam makes a puzzled face - trying to figure out why the
actress is wearing a German servant-girl outfit.

SAM
Good to see you. Uh...

The actress points down at her dress. She stands awkwardly -
body gangly - terrible posture.

ACTRESS
It's for a role...

SAM
Ah ok. Come on in.

Sam lets the young woman into his living room, closing the
door behind her.

Old wallpaper covers the walls... lined with movie posters,
pop culture paraphernalia, and 30-something-male crap.

We can still hear the rock song from outside.
The girl spins around and faces Sam with an overly excited

grin. The imperfections on her skin are more visible against
the sunlight.

ACTRESS
So... weirdly, I have an audition
around the corner... and thought you

might wanna have lunch together. You
like sushi, right?

The actress lifts up a large bag of restaurant food.

SAM
Yeah. Wow. Thank you.

The actress lowers her smile, sniffing the air.

ACTRESS
What's that smell?
SAM
Oh... there's a lotta skunks around

here. In the woods by the golf course.

Sam points toward the side of the building.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

SAM
They're always spraying. Not much you
can do about it.

ACTRESS
Eckkh.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - LATE MORNING

Sam fucks the actress doggy-style on the bed. He slaps her ass
as hard as he can, keeping an eye on the bedroom television.
He's watching the Wimbledon Finals. A women's match between an
Eastern European and some Swedish model.

Hitting her stride, the actress grunts louder and with more
force than the tennis queens on tv.

A framed and signed poster of Kurt Cobain hangs over Sam's
bed. It's the famous black and white close up from his Rolling
Stone cover.

ACTRESS
I love your poster.

Still grinding her ass against Sam, the actress stares up at
Kurt Cobain.

SAM
Thanks. I actually saw them in
concert. Believe it or not. I'm one of
the few.

ACTRESS
Wow. Is that signed?

SAM
Uh, recently, actually... I know a
girl who knows his daughter. It's her
signature.

ACTRESS
That's still really cool.

Sam leans forward and grabs the actress' jaw in his hand,
twisting her face towards his. They kiss and make-out on the
bed. Connected like insects.

Suddenly, the tennis match is interrupted by a news break... a
stylish woman stands with her microphone below some enormous
gated mansion in the hills of Los Angeles.

The graphic chyron below her reads: "Billionaire Mogul
Missing!"

(CONTINUED)
10.
6 CONTINUED:

Sam watches the television.

BOTOX REPORTER

(on tv)
Reporting live from outside the
Hollywood estate of billionaire mogul
Jefferson Sevence... we have
confirmation that Sevence has
apparently gone missing after a late
night fishing trip off the coast of
Catalina Island. Witnesses claim to
have seen him returning to the main
land, and his car, a 1935 Deusenberg,
has yet to be located.

The actress turns her head and looks back at the tv, still
taking it from Sam.

A picture of JEFFERSON SEVENCE appears on screen. He's an
older man, though handsome, and with still blond hair.

The television cuts to a shot of MRS. SEVENCE, a thirty-
something woman more than suitable for providing progeny and
affection to a wealthy man.

MRS. SEVENCE
(on tv)
Jeff, I love you, your family loves
you...

Standing behind the woman are the Sevence's FIVE CHILDREN,
ranging in age between 8 and 24. The oldest daughter,
MILLICENT SEVENCE, stares ahead coldly - covered in piercings
and giant yellow sunglasses.

THE SEVENCE KIDS CHOIR
(on tv)
We love you dad.

Mrs. Sevence breaks down and begins to cry. Her teenage SON
steps forward, putting his arm around her shoulder. His own
face shakes and contorts as he weeps.

MRS. SEVENCE
(on tv)
I know we're gonna see you again soon.
I know you're alive. I feel it.

We watch the tv and the fucking from the periphery of Sam's
room.

Porn, Playboys, notebooks, "Lady from Shanghai" lobby cards
and bags of Doritos litter Sam's dresser

(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED: (2)

A 70's OUI magazine sits on his guitar amp - the cover model's
bush hidden beneath an old can of spray paint. Red circle
marks dot the cover like coasters under cups of cranberry
juice.

MRS. SEVENCE
(on tv)
We're offering a 2 million dollar
reward for any information that helps
us find my husband. I beg you for your
help. Please bring daddy home.

The woman covers her face - weeping uncontrollably.
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - LATE MORNING

Sam and the actress lay naked in bed next to each other,
cooling off.

The neighbor's parrot shouts loudly.

ACTRESS
What is that?

The actress fans herself, blowing cool air onto her chest and
neck. She's still in her German dirndl tights.

SAM

It's the neighbor's parrot.
ACTRESS

Oh.
ACTRESS

What's it saying?

SAM
I'm not sure.

They listen to the parrot as it continues to caw and shout.
PARROT
(0.S.)
Rrrottafendnnnddddd!

ACTRESS
Not a friend?

SAM
Maybe. It's hard to say.

The actress shrugs as she grabs an old 1970's Playboy from the
stack of magazines next to the bed. She flips through it.

(CONTINUED)
12.
7 CONTINUED:

The artsy cover shows a naked woman floating upside down
through the bluest of water.

SAM
That's my favorite issue.

ACTRESS
Why this one?

SAM
I found it in my dad's tool drawer in
the garage when I was really young.

ACTRESS
Oh. Did you steal it?

SAM
Yeah. The cover with the girl. That
was the first thing I ever masturbated
to.

The actress laughs, spinning the magazine around to examine
the submerged playmate on the front cover.

ACTRESS
She's pretty.

SAM
I know.

ACTRESS

The first thing I ever masturbated to
was probably a rerun of Charles in
Charge.

Sam chuckles. A big grin. The actress laughs along with him.

SAM
That's awesome.

ACTRESS
Yeah.

The actress looks over and sees some papers, previously
covered by the pornography. She grabs the handwritten sheets
and stares at the complicated lines of text and numbers.

ACTRESS
What is this?

Sam grabs the papers from her... very embarrassed to share it.

SAM
Oh don't look at that.

(CONTINUED)

13.
CONTINUED: (2)

ACTRESS
What is it?

SAM
Eh - it's nothing.

ACTRESS
Ok.

Sam stuffs the papers underneath an old Playboy from the
1980's. He stands and puts on his underwear.

Rock music is heard. Sam peeks outside through the cheap white
blinds. Looking for the source.

He sees Sarah walking away down the garden path with her dog -
her stereo blasting. A trail of wet footsteps behind her

The bird shouts again.

PARROT
(0.S.)
Rrrobbefennntdmm!

ACTRESS
Rotterdam?

SAM
I don't think so.

Sam keeps peeping through the blinds, ignoring the naked
actress behind him. She doesn't notice or care as she
reapplies her lipstick - using the video screen of her "iPhone
4" like a mirror compact.

Sarah unlocks her apartment door and goes inside. Sam watches
as the little poodle dog follows her in.

ACTRESS
What are you looking at?

SAM
That damn bird.

The door closes as the parrot cackles and yells the same
unknowable phrase once more.

INT. SAM'S FORD MUSTANG - DAY

Sam drives his black Mustang down Sunset Boulevard. He passes
Sunset Junction.

The shops. The restaurants. The beautiful and blessed people
of the neighborhood.
14.

INT. SECRET HEADQUARTERS COMIC SHOP - DAY

Sam browses the aisles of comics. He grabs an issue of Spider
Man and adds it to the small stack in his arms.

Two nearby patrons chat loudly while looking at some Jimmy
Corrigan anthologies.

CUTE ART WOMAN
Someday I really want to swim with
wild dolphins.

UGLY ART MAN
I have a friend who does that.

CUTE ART WOMAN
Oh you'll have to introduce me.

UGLY ART MAN
I will.

Sam scans the local press, comics and zines - hanging
separately on a rotating wire shelf. He notices one in
particular.

Rough and xeroxed in an underground art style, Sam picks up a
small, handmade and hand-drawn zine. Its title is:

Under the Silver Lake

On the cover are several strange drawings. The local
Silverlake Junction sign, the Elliott Smith wall, a naked
woman in a mask, a man holding a sign, and some tiny text at
the bottom of the page.

Sam flips through the zine. He sees an article titled:
Beware the Dog Killer

Sam stares at the headline then scans the page. He closes the
zine and adds it to his pile.

Standing at the register, the CLERK examines Sam's purchases
like a curator - nodding approval or staying condescendingly
silent. He punches numbers into the register.

Lifting up the handmade zine, the clerk grins and stares down
at the small text on the cover page.

CLERK
(reading aloud)
Only I know the secrets of Silverlake.
(MORE )

(CONTINUED)

9 CONTINUED: 9
CLERK (cont'd)
In time I will reveal the truth behind
the mysterious crimes, murders and
disappearances within this cursed

community. I have the answers... I
will reveal all... Under the Silver
Lake.

The clerk laughs and Sam smiles back at him. Politely.

CLERK
Jesus.
SAM
Do you know who writes this?
CLERK
Yeah. A local guy. Uh, strange, but
nice.
SAM

Does he come in here much?

CLERK
Sure. I see him.

SAM
If I gave you like five bucks, would
you give him my number and ask him to
call me?

CLERK
I don't know.

Sam grabs a pen and writes his name and number down on a comic
store business card.

SAM
Come on. I like his work. I'd like to
meet him. You're just... passing ona
number.

CLERK

(condescending)

Ok. Sure. But I don't need your five
dollars.

Sam takes the money and puts it back in his wallet.
10 EXT. RANCHO LOS FELIZ APARTMENTS - NIGHT 10

Sam walks down the dark garden path. The night is quiet except
for crickets, the trickle of water, and the occasional siren.

(CONTINUED)
10

16.
CONTINUED: 10

Sam notices movement. A small skunk walks along the hedges -
seeming to trail the young man. Sam stops and waits, watching
the tail of the smelly animal move further into the darkness.

Turning beyond the shrubs, toward a first level patio, Sam
sees the white Bichon Frise from the pool. The dog is tied to
the railing, pooping on an open newspaper. Music pours from
inside the apartment through the screen door.

Sam steps through the grass toward the dog. He pulls a
colorful dog biscuit from his pocket and places it on the
ground.

Coca Cola nibbles at the biscuit. Enjoying his treat.

SAM
Good dog.

The door slides open and Sarah stands before Sam. She's
wearing her white bonnet and a casual, but beautiful dress.
Black reading glasses sit atop her nose.

SARAH
Hello.

SAM
Hi.
Sam leans closer, watching the dog eat. Sarah kneels near her
pet and rubs his back.
SARAH
Wow. Look at that, Coca-Cola. This
nice man gave you a treat. Can you say
thank you?
The dog just continues to eat - chewing small and fast bites.

SAM
His name's Coca-Cola?

SARAH
Yeah. Dependable as sunshine.

Sam doesn't follow, but he plays along, watching Sarah's chest
through her low hanging dress.

SAM
Was that a coke slogan?

Sam rubs the dog's ear. Coca-Cola doesn't look up from his
food.

(CONTINUED)

SARAH
An old one... I think. My great
grandma used to say it. She was a
pretty smart lady.

Sam just nods along, looking from Sarah's grinning face to her
hanging chest - as she leans far forward.

SARAH
What kind of dog do you have?

SAM
My dog died recently.

SARAH
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

SAM
Thanks.

Sarah looks at Sam's eyes. He tries to smile a bit, but it
comes off a little sad.

SARAH
Well it's nice to meet you.
SAM
Yeah, you too.
SARAH
Uhh... You wanna come in for a minute?

Have a drink?
11 INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 11

Sarah hands Sam a cocktail. He stands in the middle of her
cluttered living room. Women's things.

Sarah falls back and stretches across her recliner. Sam sits
next to her on the couch.

Sarah giggles to herself. Uncontrollably.

SAM
What is it?

She shakes her head and smiles. Laughing a bit more.

SARAH
I saw you spying on me. Earlier

SAM
No I wasn't.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 11

She cackles silently - having to turn her head away.

SARAH
At the pool. I saw you.
SAM
I don't know what you're talking

about.
The girl makes a face - waiting for him to tell the truth.

SARAH
Fine. You weren't spying, but I saw
you on your balcony. Will you at least
admit to that?

SAM
Sure.

Sarah smiles to herself, bunching her legs up on the chair
and gulping her drink

SARAH
Were you masturbating?
SAM
No.
SARAH
Well it's not that strange. I
masturbate...
SAM

Me too. But I wasn't trying to...

Sarah seems stuck on the thought. A mixture of odd innocence
and naivete. She interrupts...

SARAH
(simple and sincere)
Doesn't everybody?

SAM
Sure. Listen, I'd tell you if I was,
but I was just... looking. That's it.

SARAH
Ok. I believe you.

Sarah reaches over and lifts up a large bong from the floor

It's a glass ice bong, filled with pink spiral percolators.
Top of the line.

SARAH
Wanna get stoned?

SAM
Uh, yeah, sure.

INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 12

The pair are fucked up. Stoned and eating snacks on Sarah's
white, old-lady, flower-quilted bed.

Antique furniture, almost girlish in nature, fills the room.
White silk hangs from the tall bed posts.

They are watching a scene from "How to Marry a Millionaire" on
the little bedroom tv. Marilyn flirts and glows onscreen.

Coca Cola lays in the bed next to Sarah.

Three collectible Barbie dolls sit on top of the television.
They are modeled after Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, and
Lauren Bacall. A perfect match for the movie playing below
them.

Sam notices a simple silver bracelet around Sarah's wrist. He
touches it, moving his fingers over it and onto the back of
her hand. He gently caresses her skin.

Playful. Flirting.

SAM
That's pretty. Is it engraved?

SARAH
Yeah. From an old boyfriend.

SAM
An old boyfriend.

SARAH
Yup.

Sarah stretches her leg out and turns her ankle in Sam's
direction. On it, is a tattoo of a cartoon zebra hang gliding.

SARAH
What do you think of my tattoo?

SAM
Is it real?

SARAH
No. Temporary. From a pack of gum.

SAM
Thank God for temporary.

Sarah giggles and smiles as she grabs two saltine crackers in
one hand and a glass of orange juice in another

SARAH
Okayyyy. Here we go.

Sarah puts the crackers in her mouth and immediately takes a
big sip of 0J. She chews and swallows it all as she talks.

Sam stares at the freckles on her chest.

SARAH
(with her mouth full)
I know you think it's gross... but
this one time when I was sick in grade
school, I started eating saltines,

instead of my chicken noodle... then I
took a sip of oj and... it was
delicious.

Sam holds his grin.
SARAH
It's one of those undiscovered unknown
combinations that no one should die
without trying once.

SAM
Ok.

SARAH
Now you gotta try it.

Sarah picks up two more saltines and holds them up before
Sam's mouth. She leans very close, studying and guiding the
the wafers like a jeweler focused on a diamond.

Sam moves his head past the crackers and kisses Sarah's parted
lips.

They make out for a moment on the bed.

Sam pulls away, and Sarah continues to chew a bit of the
cracker in her mouth - staring into Sam's eyes.

She smiles and laughs. Just the sound of air through her nose.

The front door opens. Voices and shuffling interrupt the game.

BLONDE
Sarah, we're home. We brought
somebody .

Sam and Sarah look through the bedroom door to the living
room. Sarah's pretty roommates, a 22 year old BLONDE and a 24
year old BRUNETTE place new bags of clothes and boxes of shoes
all over the floor and couch.

Behind the girls is a 40-something man with a large beard, an
earring and a brown leather vest. Some bad HIPSTER PIRATE.

SARAH
Ok.

Sarah watches as her roommates swarm the space. Noise. She
looks around, trying to decide what to do. Sam leans towards
her on the bed.

SAM
You wanna grab a drink at the bar?

SARAH
No. I should probably call it a night.

SAM
Really? Come on. One drink. I really
don't feel like going home right now.

SARAH
Not tonight, ok?

SAM
Alright.

Sarah climbs off the bed.
SARAH
Come over tomorrow afternoon. We can
hang out then.

SAM
Ok.

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 13
Walking toward the door, Sam passes Sarah's roommates. They

don't pay any attention to him, moving around like bees with

their boxes of designer shoes. Not even a smile or a nod.

They are probably models... or aspiring to be.

The pirate dude sits on the couch with his legs crossed -
staring the other way. Aloof.

A flash of light.

Through the patio door, Sam sees fireworks exploding in the
sky beyond the rooftops.

SAM
Weird. Kinda late in the month for
fireworks, isn't it?
The girls say nothing. Awkward silence. Sam shrugs.

SAM
Leftovers, I guess.

Sarah seems troubled as she turns away from the fireworks and
faces Sam. She tries to grin, but it reads false.

SAM
Okayyy. Well goodnight.
SARAH
Goodnight .
SAM

Ok. I'll see you tomorrow.

SARAH
Good.

Sam walks outside as Sarah closes the door

EXT. VESELICH AVENUE - NIGHT 14
Sam walks along the lamp-lit sidewalk, passing the houses and
decrepit apartments of his east side neighborhood. He spins

his key chain in his hand.

Sam steps into the street, reaching his car, a late model
black Mustang.

He stares in shock.

The whole side of the car has been keyed. Scratch marks cover
it from fender to rear panel.

A very large cartoon penis is scratched into the hood. Deep in
the paint.

Enraged, Sam grabs the door handle, but quickly pulls his hand
back. Chewed gum sticks to his fingertips, stretching over his
palm in elongated wet strands.

SAM
Fuck.

Sam wipes the gum onto the concrete and sits there, staring at
the scratch marks up and down his car. Overwhelmed.

He breathes slowly but deeply.

Sam hears a noise. Distant. He looks down the street and sees
a few teenage boys crossing by some parked cars - creeping
suspiciously.

Standing up, Sam sneaks closer, using the cover of trees,
garbage cans and a parked van. He gets within sight of the
kids.

Three boys. Probably thirteen to fifteen years old. Stupid
grins on their faces. Keys in hand. One of them has a carton
of eggs.

The boys chuckle as the smallest of the three kids drops his
pants and starts to pee on the passenger side door of some old
BMW.

Near silent laughter. Open mouths shaking in vandal's delight.
The boy finishes then plays with his fly - zipping up.

Sam walks up to the boy casually from the darkness. The kid
turns. Sam grabs his t-shirt under the collar and pulls him
toward a heavy punch - to the face.

The boy grunts - exhaling his pain.

STUPID BOY #1
Uhhhh.

STUPID BOY #2
What the hell, man?

The kid drops the carton onto the grass. Sam grabs an egg from
the carton and pushes it into the boys mouth. He chokes and
screams as the egg mixes with the blood in his teeth.

SAM
You little fuck!

One of the boys tries to help, but Sam punches him in the
balls. He rolls over onto the grass. Moaning in agony.

Small fireworks crackle in the distance.

Sam punches the first kid again - blood flies out of his
mouth.

Jumping up, Sam kicks the other boy in the stomach. The kid
coughs and rolls in pain.

Sam turns to head home.

All we hear are the footsteps of the third boy as he races
down the center of the street.

Running away. Running away from Sam.
EXT. SAM'S BALCONY - NIGHT 15
Inside, the television is on...

A news program highlights the life of missing billionaire
Jefferson Sevence.

STILL MISSING!

The program shows archival news footage of Sevence performing
Evel Knievel style stunts and Howard Hughes-esque exploits.

Sam sits alone on his balcony drinking several beers - a six
pack resting on the spare patio chair

Sweat on his face. A sad look in his eyes.

He's reading a page from the local zine "Under the Silver
Lake" - holding it delicately with his sticky fingers.

The headline reads:
Beware the Dog Killer

On the page is a drawing of a hooded man lifting an impaled
dog into the air with his bowie knife.

We see xeroxed pics of 20's era Edendale, and silent film
photographs, as Sam reads quietly to himself.

SAM
(reading)

Silverlake and the east side of Los
Angeles were originally built around
the silent film studios. Back then the
area was known as Edendale. In 1978 a
Silverlake resident discovered a can
of film in his basement. In the movie,
a young man holds a note in front of
the camera. It reads: "No one will
ever be happy here until all the dogs
are dead". He then shoots himself in
the head with a pistol. The man was an
aspiring actor who saw himself as the
next Douglas Fairbanks.

SAM (cont'd)
He was said to have been jealous of
animals, specifically citing a deep
contempt for Teddy the Wonder Dog. He
resented the dog's success and blamed
all dogs for his failed life. The man
who found the film cannister claims
that his house was originally used for
training stunt dogs for early Mack
Sennett shorts. This author believes
the suicide of this obscure and failed
actor might be the origin or impetus
for the modern day dog killer. Is
Edendale cursed? For now the answers
remain hidden, deep below the
surface... Under The Silver Lake.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK TUNNEL - NIGHT 16
Sam walks through a long tunnel. He hears dogs barking ahead.
EXT. GRIFFITH PARK ROAD - NIGHT 17

Reaching the end of the tunnel, Sam emerges onto a dark and
wooded street.

More barking - just out of sight in the trees. He steps off
the road onto a wooded path.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK TRAIL - NIGHT 18
Sam walks slowly along the tree-lined dirt trail. Moonlit.

Dogs continue to bark in the distance. Sam follows their
sound.

He notices a dog biscuit on the ground below his feet. Picking
it up, he examines it, twisting it in his fingers. He knows
this brand.

Sam sees another - just ahead.

He follows the dark trail of multi-colored dog treats, deeper
into the woods.

Flies buzz over a small dark mass alongside the path. Sam
stops and looks down.

Partially covered by leaves, he sees the rib cage and half-
buried head of a dog in the dirt. A Bichon Frise.

Strange sounds... up ahead.

Sam hears the odd noises and walks closer to them - further
down the trail.

The sound of chewing?

Entering a clearing, Sam sees the back of a woman - Sarah's
dress, white bonnet and slippers.

Is that Sarah?
She's hunched down over a man's body. Eating something.

As Sam steps closer, he sees the dead man's face in the
moonlight. It's the missing billionaire, Jefferson Sevence.

The chewing intensifies. Lips smacking.

Sam hears a dog bark behind him. He doesn't look. It barks
again.

The woman turns around and faces him... it's not Sarah.

It's an UNKNOWN MAN with blood on his mouth and face. Flesh in
his teeth. He stares at Sam, beneath the white bonnet.

Curious and innocent like a dog.

Jefferson Sevence's body is in two pieces. Clearly severed at
the waist.

The strange man barks. It sounds like the little dog, Coca
Cola, yapping.

Sam stares as some unseen force pulls the body's two halves in
opposite directions. Each dragged across the grass into the

woods - as though pulled away by fishing line.

Gone in a flash.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - MORNING 19

Sam opens his eyes into the bright sun.

He's curled up and drooling on the couch. The TV is still on.
Beer cans nearby.

Sam rolls over and grabs a Spider Man comic from the floor. It
sticks to his fingertips. He shakes his hand, but the comic is
stuck.

Sam peels it off, then looks at the chewed gum, still covering
parts of his hand.

He exhales and shakes his head.

EXT. RANCHO LOS FELIZ APARTMENTS - DAY 20
Sam walks along the garden path towards Sarah's apartment.

He knocks on her front door. No one answers.

Sam walks around back and steps onto Sarah's patio. Coca Cola

isn't there. The patio chairs are missing. The old newspapers

and dog poop are gone.

The young man peeks in through the patio door. The blinds are
open.

There's no furniture inside. The apartment is completely
empty.

INT. RANCHO LOS FELIZ MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY 21

Inside the glass-walled, log-cabin office, Sam leans against
one of the desks.

A greasy haired MANAGER with a puckered face, looks up from
behind his monitor. His contempt is obvious. He stares at Sam
as though he's looking into an unflushed toilet.

MANAGER
They moved out. How does that not
makes sense?

SAM
Who moves out in the middle of the
night?

MANAGER

They wanted to leave. They forfeited
their deposit, paid the lease. They..
moved... out. Nothing strange about

it.

SAM
I don't know why she wouldn't have
told me?

MANAGER

I don't know. Maybe she didn't like
you. Maybe she knows you're poor and
you haven't paid your rent. Maybe she
doesn't want to date a homeless man?

Sam says nothing. He stares at the smug manager - anger
brewing.

Ok. Great.

INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY 22

Sam drinks whiskey in the dark bar. Sunlight occasionally cuts
across the shadows, as patrons enter or exit.

A heavy man, with a half-bald head, shifts on his stool. Sam's
43-year-old BAR BUDDY gulps his beer and rubs his ear in
contemplation.

SAM
I couldn't even find her online.

BAR BUDDY
Yeah. It's kinda weird. I don't know.
What do ya do?

SAM
Not sure.

Two drunk women, behind tall beers, carry on their own
conversation at the bar. We hear pieces of it...

BAR BUDDY OLD DRUNK WOMAN
Have you heard about these The only thing I hate more
dog killers? than getting patted on the
head is looooove on a schedule.
SAM
There's more than one? YOUNG DRUNK WOMAN
They always say to me "you're

Sam shrugs... Sure, evidence. Why not? He takes a big swig of
whiskey.
EXT. NEAR SARAH'S PATIO - DAY 23

Sam steps behind some shrubs, locating Sarah's bedroom window.
He's sweaty. A bit drunk.

He looks back and scans the neighboring balconies. Seems
clear. No one's around.

The young man slides a screwdriver behind the window screen
and pops it out. Quickly, he climbs inside with a thud.

INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 24
Sam twists the blinds closed - covering the open window.

He turns and faces the empty room. Dust sits along the carpet
edges where furniture once stood.

Sam looks down the hallway into the vacant living room. He
casually spins back and sees the closed closet door.

He walks over and opens it. The clothes and shoes are gone.
But at the top of the shelf is a box. Sam pulls it down and
looks inside.

He sees some music CDs, a dance trophy, three collectible
Barbie dolls from the "How to Marry a Millionaire" series, an
open pack of Fruit Stripes gum, a pink vibrator and a
photograph of Sarah. Sam grabs the picture of Sarah smiling in
her white hat, and puts it in his pocket.

He hears a sound. Keys rattling. The front door begins to
unlock.

Sam puts the box back on the shelf, steps out and closes the
closet door. He hears the front door click as it starts to
open.

Thinking fast, Sam climbs back out the bedroom window. He
reaches in and settles the shaking blinds.

EXT. NEAR SARAH'S PATIO - CONTINUOUS 25

Sam remains there, behind the bushes, peeking into the
bedroom. Waiting to see who's arrived.

A young woman, TROY, in jean shorts and a Joan Jett and the
Blackhearts t-shirt, steps into the bedroom. Her hair is thin
and "dirty white". Her face is pretty, but a little masculine.
A tomboy, sex-pot and scenester combined.

Sam watches the girl open the closet and go inside - a cloth
Trader Joe shopping bag in her hand.

After a moment, she emerges with the box in her arms.

Setting it down in the middle of the empty room, Troy dumps
the contents of the box into the bag. She reaches in, grabs a
stick of gum and puts it in her mouth.

Troy picks up the bag and walks into the hallway.

As she leaves, the girl closes the bedroom door - revealing a
marking on the wall - previously hidden.

°c
Through the blinds, Sam stares at the strange symbol.
Drawn in pink nail polish...
Two diamond shapes, joined at the tip...

°c
Sam stares at the symbol for a moment. Clearly puzzled.
A storm door closes.
Footsteps.

Sam ducks and watches Troy cross by, swinging her bag of
goodies along the garden path.

EXT. VESELICH AVENUE - DAY 26

Trailing the girl from the opposite side of the street, Sam
walks slowly, stepping behind trees and parked cars.

Troy strolls along the sidewalk.

A car pulls up in the intersection before her. It's a 1984
Volkswagon Rabbit Wolfsburg convertible.

Two other hipster girls are inside. A black haired girl is

Familiar indie-rock pours from the speakers.

Troy races up and hops into the passenger seat. The car takes
off towards Los Feliz Boulevard.

Sam sprints to his car.
INT. SAM'S FORD MUSTANG - DAY 27

Sam drives along Los Feliz keeping the Rabbit convertible in
his sights - just a few cars ahead.

He follows the girls, turning left onto Griffith Park
Boulevard.

Sam watches their car slow down and stop in front of John
Marshall High School. He pulls over and waits.

Troy and her friends sit still - engine running - across from
the football field.

Some local teens pass by Sam's car. They point and laugh at
the penis drawing covering his hood. He ignores them.

From his center console, Sam pulls out a pen and an LA County
parking ticket. He draws the secret shape on the ticket.

°c

Looking up, Sam notices the girls staring over at the high
school scoreboard. Some numbers flash on the visitor's side.

The number 7... then the number 5... and finally the number 1.
Sam writes them on his ticket.
751

The white rabbit convertible pulls back onto the road and
heads towards Rowena. Sam stays in pursuit.

INT. SAM'S FORD MUSTANG - DAY 28

Park Avenue.

He watches the girls walk up to the nearby boat house.
Leaving his car, Sam follows the threesome.

He looks around the boat house and sees a PARK EMPLOYEE
helping the girls into two red paddle boats. Troy climbs in
with the brunette - the Trader Joe bag over her shoulder

They start to pedal away from the dock. The handsome Park
Employee eyes them as they float off.

Sam hops in his own blue paddle boat and starts to pedal -
churning water and gaining momentum. Paddling out, he follows
the two red boats from a distance as they round the bend.

Swishing water.
Shwwww. Shwwww. Shwwww.

Moving under the bridge, Sam turns the corner into the open
water. The lake is calm. The orange sky reflects over the
park, mixing with palm trees, flowers and the gentle gaze of
the Lady of the Lake statue.

The girls stop pedaling. Their boats slow down and begin to
simply drift. The redhead waves at her friends in the first
boat. They makes faces back at her. A few splashes of water

Sam stays still, letting his boat float sideways within the
lake. He casually turns and watches the girls.

Waiting.

Troy and her friend start to paddle together once more. Faster
than before. Their boat reaches the opposite shore line.

Sam watches as a man appears over the hilltop. He runs down
over the grass and meets Troy as her paddle boat bumps against
the concrete rim of the lake.

Sam recognizes the man. It's the middle-aged hipster pirate he
saw at Sarah's.

Troy passes the cloth bag to the pirate. He takes it and runs
back up the hill.

He's gone.
SAM
(whispering)
Fuck.

Sam looks around, and starts to turn his paddle boat toward
the dock.

INT. SAM'S FORD MUSTANG - EVENING 30

A few lengths behind the convertible Rabbit, Sam drives his
car down 2nd Street towards the city.

Homeless people look up from their shopping carts and
cardboard beds as the black Mustang passes by.

Sam enters the tunnel under Bunker Hill. He stares ahead - the
girls sit calmly together

Turning onto 6th Street, the Rabbit drives up in front of the
Standard Hotel. Sam trails behind, watching as Troy and her
friends hop out - pulling beach towels and pool rafts from the
car. The brunette passes the keys off to the SHADY VALET.

The redhead pulls her t-shirt off, revealing a bikini top. She
swings the shirt over her shoulder and smiles to the brunette.

Sam drives closer, watching the three pretty hipsters go into
the back door of the hotel. Troy laughs as she blows air into
an inner tube - disappearing through the doorway.

Pulling into a blue-lined parking space, Sam takes out a
handicap-parking permit and hangs it from his mirror.

INT. STANDARD HOTEL ELEVATOR - EVENING 31

Sam rides up alone. The elevator doors open. Live music pours
in from the rooftop patio.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STANDARD ROOFTOP BAR - EVENING 32
Standing before Sam is a leggy woman in a bikini and black top

hat. Her extended leg in the doorway forces Sam to face her -
although he would have done so regardless.

BIKINI TOP HAT GIRL
Welcome to purgatory.

SAM
Uh... good to be here. I needed some
time to think about things.

The bikini girl smiles. She pulls a small sewing needle from a
plush, cherry-shaped, pin cushion and presents it to Sam.

BIKINI TOP HAT GIRL
Use it wisely.

Sam smirks and slides the pin through the pocket of his shirt
as he walks on.

He passes an identical girl, performing an identical greeting
to a small crowd exiting the adjacent elevator.

A POET dressed like a 1940's housewife marches by, stepping
across the furniture and tables while reading poetry against
the loud music. She tears little pieces of paper from her
page and drops them to the ground like rose petals.

HOUSEWIFE POET
All these... holy trinities of
women... thriving like plants... under
the heat... of the city's male
gaze....three three three... three
three three... three three three...

Sam scans the area for Troy and the girls. He sees them
sitting down on a big couch near the stage. A live band is
playing before a crowd.

Stepping closer, Sam sees the understated singer and his
gorgeous female band. It's Jesus and the Brides of Dracula -
made clear by the accompanying signage and drum logo.

The THREE BRIDES are all in white 1920's gowns with pale skin
and sad eyes. JESUS is in old blue jeans - bare chested with a
cross around his neck.

Sam moves closer as the band kicks into a prolonged music jam.
Faster and faster, the tempo rises.

The crowd parts as a dancer emerges from behind the stage. She
draws all attention - including Sam's.

A teenage girl in a green unitard dances provocatively wearing
an enormous mass of multi-colored balloons. BALLOON GIRL
smiles and gyrates. Her arms wave in the air as her shoulders
sway.

Suddenly she begins to scream over the pounding drums. All
part of the act, but strange nevertheless.

Balloon girl dances through the crowd screaming as everyone
pokes and pops the balloons with their sewing needles.

Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop.

The music reaches a crescendo and ends with a final roar

Sam watches as balloon girl emerges from the mob - she's
covered in deflated rubber over her nylon suit. She stares up
at the sky, as though healed by Pentecostal powers.

The crowd cheers as the band disappears behind a curtain.

TROY
I love you Jesus!

Sam pulls the sewing needle from his shirt and tosses it over
the edge of the roof - without thinking twice.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STANDARD ROOFTOP - EVENING 33
Loud music everywhere.

Sam sits down along the edge of the pool - jeans rolled up -
feet in the water. He sips his fruity cocktail and watches
Troy and her girlfriends strip into their bathing suits.

Troy kicks off her sandals and dives into the water.

Sam watches Troy swim to the far edge of the pool. The young
woman climbs onto a raft and lays back - she pulls a flask
from her waist-band and takes a swig.

The redhead, FANNIE, a freckled and slightly plump beauty,
stretches and yawns at the edge of the pool. Her teeth are
oddly spaced - a missed opportunity for braces - but even this
mistake contributes to her appeal.

The black haired girl, MAE, steps cautiously into the pool.
She's slim with dark features - girlish compared with her
friends - a bob haircut more at home in the 1970's than the
millennial teens.

MAE
Is Jesus still here or did he leave
already?

Sam fixes his sights on Troy. She is calmly spinning slow
circles on her raft.

TROY
I'm not sure.

FANNIE
He's with one of the brides I think.

Fannie climbs down the ladder into the blue tank. She starts
to swim.

MAE
Romantically?

FANNIE
Probably.

Sam drinks and eavesdrops - trying to look like he belongs.

Fannie and Mae laugh together as Troy grins. She takes another
gulp from her flask.

TROY
You don't become a bride without
fucking Jesus.

MAE
If he wasn't so good looking he'd
never get away with it.

Troy climbs out of the water, looking back at her friends.

TROY
Blessed by his holy father I guess.

Sam watches as Troy heads to the bathroom. He stands up and
follows.

INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - EVENING 34
The toilet flushes and Troy opens her stall. Sam is standing
between her and the sink. Troy gives him a dirty look and

tries to walk around him. Sam blocks her path, holding up the
photo of Sarah.

SAM
Do you know this girl?

The girl looks at the photograph, but says nothing. She stares
at Sam - looking him up and down.

SAM
Do you know where she is?

Troy spits her gum in Sam's face. It hits his nose and falls
to the floor. Sam grabs her arm and yanks her closer

SAM
Fuck you. Seriously. Is she ok?

Troy knees Sam in the balls. She pulls away from his grip as
he falls to the floor.

they've never visited.

BATHROOM GIRL
Get the fuck outta here. It's the
ladies room.

ANOTHER BATHROOM GIRL
Piece of shit. Asshole.

As the girls shout and curse, their barking becomes literal.
From their sweet mouths come deep and disturbing dog barks.

The girls cackle and laugh at their explosion of expletives.
Sam tries to sit up.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STANDARD HOTEL ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 35

Sam hobbles, hunched over, through the beautiful crowd. It's
even louder than before.

One of the Brides of Dracula, a green-eyed beauty in oversized
reading glasses and grey lipstick, chats energetically with a
gentle giant.

Sam passes by the READING GLASSES BRIDE, moving toward the
pool.

READING GLASSES BRIDE
We thought about naming ourselves
Jesus and the Brides of Frankenstein.
Cause there's just so much vampirism
in pop culture, we were worried the
Dracula thing might be a little
tiresome.

GIANT HIPSTER WITH GIANT BEARD
I think it works for you.

This conversation, and others like it, plays out in the
background - overlapping with the primary story. Altman-esque.

A HAND lands hard on Sam's shoulder. He jumps.

FAUX ANGRY VOICE

Sam spins around and sees ALLEN, a grinning guy with floppy
hair and a chiseled jaw - laughing and patting Sam's back.

SAM
Hey, Allen. Good to see you.

Allen gives Sam a hug. Sam looks down at Allen's attire.

Though very masculine, Allen wears a few pieces of women's
clothing - slightly repurposed for irony or comfort's sake.

SAM
Is that a woman's blouse?
ALLEN
I guess so.
SAM
Ok.
ALLEN
What are you doing? Keepin' busy with

SAM

Of course. How 'bout you?

Allen drifts through the conversation. Floating in both words

Nobody does.

Allen grins, nodding and patting Sam on the shoulder a few
more times.

SAM
Hey, do you know a blond, a redhead
and a brunette that drive a Rabbit
convertible?

ALLEN
No, but I'm looking forward to meeting
‘em.

SAM
Well... I'm... trying...

A beautiful black girl in a sparkling emerald evening gown
walks up to Allen. He smiles to the EMERALD BEAUTY and points
to her dress.

ALLEN
Hey! I like the dress.

The girl smiles and tips her chin in flirtatious recognition.

EMERALD BEAUTY
Thanks, Allen.

Emerald Beauty stares over Allen's shoulder

EMERALD BEAUTY
Oh my God. Take a look.

Both Allen and Sam turn and see a leggy brunette in gold
shorts.

It's Millicent Sevence.
She's drinking, laughing and flirting with another girl.

It's hard to say what a person might

The pair ignore Sam, as they scoff and stare.

Emerging from the crowd in her white gothic gown, one of the
Brides of Dracula edges into the circle. A fragile doll.

The MEEK BRIDE waves at the group like a shy schoolgirl - a
wicker basket filled with cookies in her hand.

MEEK BRIDE
I'm doing a secret solo show tomorrow
night at Hollywood Forever if you
wanna come.

ALLEN
Yeah. I'd love to.

MEEK BRIDE
These are your tickets.

The girl delicately hands both Allen and Emerald Beauty a
homemade cookie. The Meek Bride looks at Sam, pauses and gives
him one too - like Valentine's day in grade school. Everyone
gets a card if you show up.

BRIDE
Don't eat it or break it. If it's
missing anything, even a crumb, they
won't let you in.

Sam looks at the cookie in his hand - frosted with green
piping - the number 76.

The Meek Bride offers a half-grin then turns to deliver more
VIP treats to the crowd. She repeats her pitch.

Really?

EMERALD BEAUTY
His body was burned or something.

EMERALD BEAUTY

SAM
Does she know?

All eyes turn towards Millicent Sevence. The billionaire's
daughter pulls away from a sapphic kiss, and makes a funny
face as she reaches for her drink.

Emerald Beauty whispers something to a MALE MODEL. A few
people around Millicent start to look up from their smart
phones, reacting to some terrible news. More and more people
within the crowd turn their attention toward the young woman.
Millicent sways and laughs.

A chain reaction of hushed whispers. Elbowing between friends.
Faces looking up from iphones. Chatter and gossip.

Sam watches this from the edge. Everyone waits for Millicent
to hear what they already know.

A girl runs through the crowd and whispers into Millicent's
ear.

Sam watches the young woman's face. She's devastated, but
holds it in.

Millicent walks slowly through the hipsters to the elevator
She's gone.

EXT. RANCHO LOS FELIZ APARTMENTS - NIGHT 36
Sam opens the outer security gate.

Fog drifts across the garden walkways of Sam's complex. A
foreboding quality in the night air

Sam walks alone.

It's quiet except for crickets and the sound of water rippling
in the stream.

Sam hears footsteps behind him. He turns and looks back.
No one is there. Darkness.

We move with Sam, tracking through the foggy walkway. The
young man steps nervously - alert.

Sam's cell phone rings. He answers.

SAM
Hello?
COMIC MAN
(on phone)

Hi, um... one of the guys at Secret
Headquarters, the comic store, gave me
your number. They said you wanted to
talk to me.

SAM
Oh shit, yeah. I read your zine. I
wanted to ask you more about it. Is
there a time we could meet up?

COMIC MAN
(on phone)
Sure. I'll be drawing all day
tomorrow. You're welcome to stop by
the house.

Sam hears something again. He spins back as a dark figure
crosses the path - into the shadows.

SAM
Cool. Could you text me your address?

Sam stares back. Concerned.
COMIC MAN

(on phone)
Yeah I can do that.

Still watching - no movement.

SAM
Great. I'll see ya then.
COMIC MAN
(on phone)

Yeah. See you tomorrow.

Sam hangs up his phone and stares into the darkness.
Listening.

He sees a shadow lean out from behind a distant building. Gone
again.

Sam turns and starts to jog ahead. He looks around anxiously.
Through the dark garden path. In and out of the lamp light.

Reaching an intersection of paths, Sam slows down and looks to
his right. He notices a man standing in the center of the
walkway.

The man is not moving. His body and face are shrouded in
darkness.

Sam turns left and starts to run. He doesn't look back
Turning another corner, Sam scrambles and climbs behind a
large tree.

Loud rustling - behind him. A strange cry.

Sam turns and sees black fur rising from the brush within the
tall grass. It's the rear end of a skunk

The animal shakes and sprays. Sam covers his head and closes
his eyes as the skunk bathes him in its odor.

Sam staggers out of his hiding place, wiping the fluid from
his face. His eyes water. He hunches over on the sidewalk and
begins to heave.

Sam vomits on the walkway.

Cough. Choke.

Sitting there, he tries to open his eyes. Slow and painful.
The fluid stings.

Sam opens his eyelids - just enough. He looks up the garden
path and sees no one. The shadow man is gone.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 37

Standing on his kitchen tile, Sam strips off his clothes into
a garbage bag. The television is on nearby.

A beautifully decorated cookie sits on his counter-top next to
Sarah's photo and a parking ticket covered in symbols and
scribbles.

MALE REPORTER

(on tv)
Yes. I agree. The city is in shock at
the loss of such a cultural landmark.
This man has literally been the face
of Los Angeles for decades through his
charity work, his Hollywood production
company, the New Year's Eve telecast,
his public appearances at Awards
shows, the Rose Parade... the list
just goes on and on...

Leaning over in his underwear, Sam watches the news report. We
see helicopter footage of a burned up Deusenberg near Silver
Lake Boulevard and the 101.

Sam pulls his briefs down and tosses them into the bag.

FEMALE REPORTER

(on tv)
It's hard to believe, but the Los
Angeles Police Commissioner has
confirmed that the remains are those
of Jefferson Sevence. As we reported
earlier, Sevence was found dead in his
car with the bodies of three women
believed to be prostitutes.

This catches Sam's attention.

He runs across the room and stands before the television, buck
naked. He watches intensely.

FEMALE REPORTER
(on tv)

In addition, some unnamed sources have
leaked a very odd detail about the
case. Apparently the remains of a dog,
a breed known as Bichon Frise, were
found in the purse of one of the
victims.

FEMALE REPORTER (cont'd)
This has officially become a very
grisly and puzzling murder
investigation.

Sam watches the crime scene footage. A detective carries an
evidence bag into a police van. Reporters and cops everywhere.

Sam tilts his head, and presses a button on his cable box. The
screen pauses.

He zooms in with the remote - focusing on the grainy image of
the crime scene bag. It's white and charred.

Concerned with neither his odor nor his nudity, Sam grabs
Sarah's photo from the counter

He holds the picture up, examining the details of Sarah's
white bonnet - the pink ribbon hanging near her ear.

He compares it against the tv screen, zooming-in once more.

Though it's a fuzzy blur, the burnt white cloth and pink
ribbon are clearly visible within the evidence bag.

It's Sarah's hat.

SAM
Fuck.

INT. SAM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 38

Open tin cans sit on the bathroom sink. Inside the tub is Sam,
soaking in tomato juice - scrubbing the skunk scent from his
body.

The actress is on the floor, wearing a slutty nurse outfit,
and plugging her nose.

She reads out loud to Sam - a page from "Under the Silver
Lake".

ACTRESS
(reading)
Who is the Owl's Kiss?

The actress turns the zine around and shows Sam the picture
accompanying the typewriter essay. It's a cartoon depiction of
a naked woman in an owl skin mask with a large tuft of pubic
hair between her legs.

ACTRESS

According to this picture it's a naked
lady with an unshaven bush.

(CONTINUED)
46.
38 CONTINUED: 38

Sam shakes his head and smiles.

SAM
Just read it.

The actress makes a face and returns to her duty.

ACTRESS

(reading)
The Owl's Kiss is a lost legend of
folklore. Just as terrifying as the
Wolfman or Frankenstein's Monster. She
is a woman who arrives in the night,
through windows and locked doors,
naked except for her mask of
taxidermied owl skin. She seduces men
and women alike, killing them in their
sleep. This beautiful spectre is
responsible for dozens of deaths
within the Los Angeles basin, though
she has yet to be mentioned by
mainstream media. Theories abound as
to her motives. This author believes
she may be a member of a longstanding
American cult with origins in trade
and finance. It's the unlucky soul who
finds himself the recipient of an
owl's kiss.

The actress raises her brow and tosses the zine on top of the
toilet.

ACTRESS
What a bunch'a horse shit.

Sam nods out of respect as the young woman rests her back
against the sink. White nylon legs sprawled unshyly over the
floor.

ACTRESS
I can't believe Jefferson Sevence is
dead.

Sam listens, scrubbing his face with soap and tomato juice. He
dunks his head into the bath once or twice. Rinsing his hair.

ACTRESS
Every year more and more celebrities
and people I grew up with keep dying.
Dick Clark... Elizabeth Taylor...
Johnny Carson.

47.
38 CONTINUED: (2) 38

SAM
Everybody dies... even the people we
think will be here forever.

with her nose still plugged, the actress's voice sounds extra
strange and nasally.

ACTRESS
I remember hearing my aunt talking
about that feeling - realizing how
quick it all goes. It's one of those
things you don't understand until
you're in it.

SAM
Have you lost anybody? Anybody close?

The actress just nods. She looks at Sam.

ACTRESS
You?

Sam shakes his head. Not yet.

SAM
I think about it though. A lot more
than I should.

The actress pets the top of Sam's head. He looks like a big
child in the tub... an old baby covered in his food.

ACTRESS
Hey, what were those pages on your
nightstand? The ones with all the
scribbles?

SAM
Ehhhhh. That's nothing.

ACTRESS
No. Tell me. I wanna know.

SAM
You'll get all weirded out.

ACTRESS
No I won't. You've seen me doing my
chants and my prep work. I don't care
if it's weird.

SAM
Ok. Have you ever heard about old
record albums having satanic messages
in them if ya play 'em backwards?

(CONTINUED)
48.

38 CONTINUED: (3) 38
ACTRESS
Sure.
SAM
Ok... so I was watching wheel of

Fortune and I noticed that Vanna White
did this little pattern of glances
every so often. She looked forward
then right then left and then back
again. And I started wondering... is
that random or is there a reason for
it? Is there a pattern behind it? And
if there is, maybe there's something
meaningful in that pattern.

The actress stares and listens as Sam continues explaining his
strange theory.

SAM
So I started taking note of when it
happened... and for the past 7 months
I have a complete record of it. It
doesn't happen everyday... it's
literally every three episodes except
for one time. Also, it seems to happen
most Wednesdays except for last
Wednesday which happened to be a
holiday. So I graphed it out and I got
some old code books from the library
and I've been digging through them,
trying to see if it translates to
anything... like a word or a
message... something.

The actress smiles nervously, making a slight sound from her
throat as she adjusts her legs. Sam speaks faster and faster.

SAM
I mean, I've just been thinking, why
do we assume that all of this
infrastructure and entertainment and
open information beaming all over the
place into every home on the planet is
exactly what people tell us it is?
Maybe there are people more important
more powerful or wealthier than us
that communicate things or see things
in the world that are meant for them
and not for us. I think it's fucking
ridiculous to assume that media only
has one purpose... right?

The actress stares at Sam - frozen. She's freaked out, but she
tries to hide it.

ACTRESS
A little.
SAM

It's not weird. Don't you ever feel
like rich people know something that
you and I don't?

ACTRESS
Like good restaurants, maybe.

Frustrated, Sam splashes tomato juice over his chest. He
exhales deeply.

ACTRESS
Don't take this the wrong way, but you
smell so bad. I think I'm gonna get
going.
The actress starts to stand up. Stretching.

SAM
Ok. Um... thanks for the juice.

ACTRESS
I'll be back when the smell goes away.

The young woman walks out of the bathroom, leaving Sam alone.
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39

Sam sits on his couch watching Wheel of Fortune - a notebook
and pen in his hand.

He hears squeals of laughter and water splashing outside his
window.

Sam walks out to his balcony.
EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT BALCONY - NIGHT 40

Looking down at the pool, Sam sees Sarah swimming alone in the
blue water.

Sarah splashes... laughing like Marilyn Monroe.

She swims closer, looking up at Sam. He realizes that she's
naked.

SARAH

Come on in. The water is so

refreshing.
Sam watches as Sarah reaches the nearest edge of the pool. She
props herself on her elbows and lifts a single leg up onto the
deck - mimicking Marilyn. She giggles and laughs with a giant
grin.
Sam stares. More laughter
Sarah climbs out and sits on the edge of the pool. With her
back to us, she turns and smiles over her shoulder... teasing
her body.

She begins to bark at us - the sound of a large dog -
something vicious.

Her face is beautiful but her barks are horrific.

Sam watches as she playfully hops back into the pool and dives
underwater.

Splash.

It's quiet now. Sam leans over the railing and looks down.

The water settles... no one is in the pool.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING 41
Sam opens his eyes, rolls out of bed and looks straight out

the window. He sees police stringing crime-scene tape over

Sarah's apartment door.

EXT. VESELICH AVENUE - DAY 42
Sam exits his apartment gate and walks up the street. He

notices a leggy woman in a short red dress climbing out of her
Prius.

RED MINISKIRT walks daintily ahead of him on the sidewalk -
passing a drunk homeless man in the grass.

Sam watches her ass and legs as she prances along.

On the opposite sidewalk, there are more beautiful women,
staggered down the block, but marching forward.

A Fellini-esque parade of mini-skirt models moving down the
street in Sam's direction.

Sam tilts his head - trying to understand it all.

(CONTINUED)
42

51.
CONTINUED: 42

Red Miniskirt cuts across the road - pulling out her
headshots. She slows down in front of an old duplex.

Inside the dirty garage are several gorgeous models standing
around, smiling and chatting with a heavy-set man. He sits
behind a folding card table like a king. A makeshift sign
reads: Movie Auditions!

Sam passes the garage audition, staring at the odd circus.

Now behind him, Red Miniskirt paces, staring up at the trees -
wondering if she should leave.

Sam turns a corner.

Several models stand in the center of the street looking down
at the pavement. A look of disgust on their faces.

Red spray paint covers the ground. Some sort of graffiti.
Sam approaches them and the strange markings.

YELLOW MINISKIRT makes a few involuntary, hushed sounds -
publically advertising her horror at the message below her.

YELLOW MINISKIRT
Uhhhhhhhe.

Each grunt is accompanied by a body shiver and a little,
involuntary two-step dance on her yellow heels.

Sam keeps walking closer.

BLUE MINISKIRT
Gehhh.

Below their high-heeled feet are four giant words - written in
red spray paint.

Beware the Dog Killer

GREEN MINISKIRT flips her foot and grimaces, shaking her face
with tongue half extended. This really bothers her.

GREEN MINISKIRT
Lllehhhhehhhaaah.

Sam stares at the painted message as he passes the models.
Yellow Miniskirt looks up at him.

YELLOW MINISKIRT
Really creepy, huh?

BLUE MINISKIRT

GREEN MINISKIRT

Yellow Miniskirt waves her hand in front of her nose.

YELLOW MINISKIRT
What's that smell?

BLUE MINISKIRT
I don't know.

Sam sniffs himself and makes a face.
A loud MECHANICAL SOUND!

Sam looks ahead and sees a tow truck lifting his Black Mustang
onto its flatbed.

SAM
What the fuuuuckkk?

He starts to sprint, leaving the circle of runway models
behind him.

EXT. BRUNSWICK AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER 43
Sam pounds on the tow truck driver's window.

The TOW MAN rolls it down and looks at Sam with a wide and
angry mouth.

SAM
That's my car! You can't take my
fucking car!

TOW MAN
This is my job, man. You can't keep it
if you don't make the payments.

The tow man throws his truck in gear and drives off toward Los
Feliz.

Sam watches his car disappear.

A homeless woman stares, wheeling a shopping cart along the
sidewalk.

Squeak! Squeak! Go the wheels.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK BOULEVARD - DAY 44
Sam walks down Griffith Park Boulevard, covered in sweat.

He stares at the blank scoreboard near John Marshall High
School as he passes.

A car full of teenagers zips down the road. Sam hears a
familiar tune approach and recede with their passing.

You and I...
turning like teeth...
loving beneath...
the surface.

Sam listens, wiping sweat from his face. The sun covers all.

INT. COMIC MAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 45
Knock. Knock. Knock.

COMIC MAN opens his front door and greets Sam - now soaked
from the heat.

COMIC MAN
Come on in. You want a beer?

He waves Sam inside. Closing the door

SAM
Yes, please.

COMIC MAN
Hot day and a cold beer.

Sam smiles and looks around, fanning himself. It's a mess of a
house. Sketches, papers and books litter the room.

Dust balls collect in corners.

From the dim living room into the far hallway, the walls are
covered in LIFE MASKS.

Sam fixates on the dozens of solid-white faces hanging

everywhere. Their eyes are closed. Their expressions are
frozen in time.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 45

He sees... Basil Rathbone, Debbie Reynolds, Angelina Jolie,
Bela Lugosi, Katherine Hepburn, Christopher Reeve, Ashton
Kutcher, Linda Blair, Charles Laughton, Patricia Arquette, Lou
Costello and Robert Redford.

SAM
What are these masks?

COMIC MAN
They're life masks.

Comic Man hands Sam a beer. He cracks it open and takes a
drink.

SAM
What's a life mask?

COMIC MAN

They're resin castings of famous
people's faces. They're all real and
they are true to life representations
of these amazing people.

SAM
Hm.

COMIC MAN

Most of ‘em are from film productions
but some were cast by sculptors for
statue construction. Like Lincoln's...

Comic Man points to the chalk-white face of Abraham Lincoln
hanging from the wall. His eyelids are closed.

 

COMIC MAN
That's his real face... and that's
Grace Kelly's right next to Johnny
Depp.

SAM
Huh.

MAN

I really need to have a family so I
have someone to pass these on to.
Right? These people need to be
remembered.

SAM
I understand.
46

INT. COMIC MAN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 46
Sitting on the couch, surrounded by books, odd tchotchkes and
"Under the Silver Lake" zines, Sam draws the double diamond
shape on paper.

°c

Sam's photograph of Sarah sits on the paper next to the
drawing.

Comic Man leans in and looks at the symbol.

COMIC MAN
Stay quiet.
SAM
What?
COMIC MAN
It means "stay quiet". It's a hobo
code.
SAM
Really?
COMIC MAN

Yeah. Hobos and rail-riders from the
1930's used it. Here look...

Comic Man grabs a book from his giant shelf. He opens it and
shows Sam a graph of common hobo symbols.

Oo -- || X r <><> S//

Sam lifts a piece of scrap paper from within the book. It's
filled with handwritten translations. A simple KEY for the
mysterious hobo code.

COMIC MAN
They used it to let other people know
who was cool, who wasn't, what houses
might offer food, if there's a doctor
in that town who might be sympathetic
to travelers. That sort of thing.

Sam stares at the symbols, keeping the code-filled book mark
in his hand.

SAM

Well why is it in Sarah's room and who
are they telling to be quiet?

COMIC MAN
I don't know. Maybe you?

Sam takes a deep breath.

Comic man opens an issue of "Under the Silver Lake", sitting
amongst the clutter. Inside it's filled with snapshots of
"lost and found" signs from all over the east side of Los
Angeles.

Page after page...

COMIC MAN
There's been a rash of "Lost and
Found" signs for dogs, humans, and
musical equipment in the past two
years. Something big is going on. I
know it.

SAM
Do you think any of it could be
connected to Sarah?

COMIC MAN
Of course.

Sam listens... wanting to believe, but troubled by it all. He
looks at the life masks covering the walls.

Is this man sane? Am I?

Comic Man begins sorting through various issues of "Under the
Silver Lake" as he talks.

COMIC MAN
It could be a lot of things. Sex or
drug trafficking. The Dog Killer. Cult
of the Whale. I don't know... lately I
just assume the Owl's Kiss has
something to do with everything.

SAM
I'm not so sure about that.

Comic Man stares Sam down - a little offended by his
dismissal.

COMIC MAN
Do you have a dollar bill on you?

SAM
I might...

Sam digs through his wallet and pulls out a dollar. Comic Man
takes it, producing a magnifying glass from the drawer

He holds the glass over the dollar bill, steadying it on the
coffee table.

COMIC MAN
Take a look... that's the sign of the
Owl's Kiss.

Sam leans in and looks through the magnifying glass. He sees
it. A tiny owl is visible, peeking up from behind the crest of
the top-right corner's numeral one.

COMIC MAN
Right there. On every dollar bill in
this country. With every transaction
we enter a pact to live by her law...
any household that eats, lives and
trades under her eyes is subject to
her jurisdiction.

Comic Man hands the dollar back to Sam. He stares at the
little bird, previously hidden in his wallet.

COMIC MAN
Our world is filled with codes, pacts
user agreements and subliminal
messages.

More enthusiastic, Comic Man grabs piles of torn magazine
pages and ads from old Playboys... waving them in Sam's face.

COMIC MAN
Here... and here... and here...
symbols and words hidden in print
advertising...

Sam sees advertisements with concealed words circled in red
Magic marker...

POWER... LOVE... SEX... FREEDOM!
Naked women in the ice cubes of soda pop ads...
Women's mouths nearly fellating cheeseburgers...
Mae West in the Camel cigarette logo...
Dollar Bills hidden in the lettuce...

INT. COMIC MAN'S BEDROOM - DAY 47

Comic man pulls a wooden panel away from the wall, revealing a
dark crawl space.

Dusty boxes are visible at the head of the narrow passageway.

On one of the boxes, sits a surveillance monitor connected to
an old VCR.

Comic Man leans over and crawls into the secret opening,
disappearing into the darkness.

Sam looks at the surveillance monitor and VCR. He sees a LIVE
VIEW of the living room, the backdoor and the side of the
house nearest the garage.

SAM
What's with the cameras?

COMIC MAN
I'm trying to protect myself. Do you
know how many people have died from
the Owl's Kiss?

SAM
No. I don't.

ACTION FIGURES and the SKETCHES charting the stages of the
moon.

Ahhh. Here it is.

Comic Man crawls back into the light, waving a CEREAL BOX,
triumphantly.

COMIC MAN
Got it. Got it. Got it.

Comic Man climbs out and shows Sam the box of MOONSTONES
cereal from the mid 70's. He spins it around and points at the
East Los Angeles map on the back of the box.

Giant letters announce:
Treasure Hunt! Fun Prizes!

Sam studies the colorful map. Cartoon characters poke their
heads out of famous east side locations. Griffith Park
Observatory, etc...

COMIC MAN
I bought this from another collector
five years ago. I'm convinced that
this map is the key to everything I've
been searching for my whole life.

SAM
Seriously?

COMIC MAN
Seriously.

Sam points to the Contest Card on the side of the box - loaded
with fine print.
SAM

Comic Man stares at Sam with a sweaty and strained face.
Sam avoids eye contact.
EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - DAY 48

Sam passes scooter girls and fedora men as he soaks through
his shirt - melting in the heat.

He glances back, looking at the hipsters and homeless men on
the sidewalk behind him. They are all wearing similar hats.

HOMELESS MAN
Anybody spare some change? Please?

Sam divides and steps through an enormous line extending out
from the local Intelligentsia Coffee - all parties standing on
a long red carpet that ends at the Sunset gutter.

Everyone seems to know each other. A long line of feigned
surprise and big smiles.

PRETTY WOMAN
Oh my gosh, honey, what are you doing
here?

ANOTHER PRETTY WOMAN
Just grabbing an afternoon coffee.

SMUG MAN
Hey! Good to see you...

And on and on. Sam keeps walking.
Everyone is beautiful... or at least very, very interesting.

hillside.

Sam crosses a picturesque bridge, staring at the pretty
houses.

He looks around, glancing back at the empty street.

EXT. BAR BUDDY'S HOUSE - DUSK 50

Sam walks up the sidewalk and sees Bar Buddy smoking and
drinking on his porch. Seeing Sam, he waves and approaches,
meeting in the driveway.

BAR BUDDY
Where's your car?

SAM
Oh. It's in the shop. Getting
repainted from all that graffiti.

BAR BUDDY
That's what you get for driving that
cockmobile.

SAM
I like my car.

BAR BUDDY
I like my cock. I don't have to
compensate for it.

Sam ignores his friend, shaking his head.

SAM
Did you hear about Jefferson Sevence?

BAR BUDDY
Yeah they found him dead in his car
last night. With three prostitutes and
a dog.

SAM
Yeah I think Sarah was one of the
prostitutes. The dog was the same
breed as hers and I saw her hat ina
crime scene bag on the news.

SAM
Yeah. What is it?

BAR BUDDY
You gotta check out my drone.

Bar Buddy points his thumb towards the backyard.

SAM
Your what?

EXT. BAR BUDDY'S BACKYARD - NIGHT 51

A medium-sized DRONE rises up from the center of the backyard.
Silent like some future monster. Its rotors spin.

The black quadcopter houses a state of the art camera system.
The two men sit on the grass, in front of a laptop - which
rests on a cheap folding chair. Their heads are tilted close.
Beers in hand.

Sam watches the drone hover and soar through the neighborhood.
Disappearing into the black sky.

Bar Buddy operates the controls from his laptop - piloting the
drone.

SAM

Shit. Where do you get something like
this?

BAR BUDDY
I got it on amazon.

SAM
Hm.

POGO, Bar Buddy's golden retriever walks up to Sam through the
grass.

The dog licks his hand and arm. Sam pulls away - a fake smile
forming. Bar Buddy notices and tugs gently on his dog's
collar.

BAR BUDDY
Leave him alone, Pogo. Come here.

Pogo steps away. Bar Buddy rubs the dog's head, petting him
fondly. Sam relaxes.

BAR BUDDY
Look at that. Silverlake from above.

The drone soars over Los Angeles. Transmitting a blur of
lights, houses, cars and streets.

Bar Buddy sniffs the air. Something is afoul. He smells Pogo's
fur.

BAR BUDDY
Jesus, what's that smell?
SAM
It's me.
BAR BUDDY
Oh.

Bar Buddy accepts the fact with a casual nod.

He taps some buttons, watching the drone's camera-relay next
to the computer's mapping system.

The drone settles in place.

Bar Buddy focuses the camera on a large window overlooking a
canyon - some modern home in the hills.

BAR BUDDY
Ok. This is a good one. I've been
scouting houses and I think this chick
used to be in lingerie commercials.
Amazing body.

The drone's camera shows an empty, but bright living room.
Well decorated.

BAR BUDDY
Gotta be patient.

Bar Buddy taps the edge of the chair in anticipation.

SAM
You ever feel like you fucked up
somewhere a long time ago and you're
living the wrong life? Or a bad
version of the life you were supposed
to have?

BAR BUDDY
You're fine.

SAM
No. I used to think I was gonna be
someone that other people cared about.
Maybe do something important...

BAR BUDDY

Shit. Everybody thinks that, but the
world can't support it. Somebody has
to sweep the floor. This fucked up
idea that life owes us a god damn good
story is a bunch of crap. We're not
all special and we're certainly not
equal. That's the biggest lie ever

Bar Buddy looks at Sam - sees his beaten expression.
Understands it. He puts his hand on Sam's shoulder.

BAR BUDDY
Everyone thinks they're going to be
famous. Narcissism and entitlement

SAM
Look where we live.

Bar Buddy and Sam look out into the night air. The crickets
chirp. The wind blows through the trees.

BAR BUDDY
It feels like there's something darker
under the surface. Waiting to come
out. Do you ever feel like that?

SAM

Yeah... I think somebody's following
me.

(CONTINUED)

BAR BUDDY
Probably.

Bar Buddy smiles and starts to laugh.

BAR BUDDY
Who isn't being followed nowadays?

Sam laughs along with his friend.

SAM
No, but I feel like that a lot. Even
before all this craziness.

BAR BUDDY
It's the modern persecution complex.
Who needs witches and werewolves
anymore, now that we have computers?
Everyone is suffering from mild
paranoia. I don't think our fuckin'
monkey brains are comfortable knowing
that they're interlinked and routed
together like some all knowing human
brain. This shit causes delusion and
fear, but we don't see it because
we're too busy playing "Angry Birds".

SAM
I don't know.

BAR BUDDY
Persecution Complex is just the
opposite side of the spectrum from the
Privilege Complex. It's basically the
dark mirror of our dreams and
aspirations. You think you're special
and that secrets and blessings have
been planted in the world for you. The
schizophrenic thinks that people are
out to get them and that there's a
hidden and dangerous world below the
surface. These two paths are more
similar than anyone wants to admit.
Persecution complex is the modern
plague. It's the universe balancing
things out.

Two nearly middle-aged men in undersized t-shirts sitting on
the grass in a dark backyard drinking beer and huddling before
a small monitor...

Sam leans in towards the screen - taking note of the empty
room.

SAM
Doesn't seem like she's home.

BAR BUDDY
Everyone on the planet thinks that
they're somehow the "chosen one". But
they're also afraid the world might be
out to get 'em. It's the nature of
things anymore. It's modern
technology, it's saturation of pop
culture, it's living in a world where
ten years olds can become singing
superstars from their bedrooms.

SAM
Yeah, but those kids have real
success. Real money. It is possible to
get lucky and achieve a dream. Doesn't
that go against your whole thesis?

BAR BUDDY
No way. Who cares if five or ten
people catch a break? That's like
winning a golden ticket into Wonka-
land. It's appeasement. It's fantasy.
It's the stuff dreams are made of

On the screen, they see a CHESTY WOMAN walk into the room. She
takes her shirt off, revealing her bra. They watch in silence
as she sits down in a chair and starts to cry.

 

 

Bar Buddy moves the controller, turning the drone's camera
away from the sad woman's window.

SAM
I'm gonna take off. I'll see ya soon.

BAR BUDDY
Be careful out there.

Sam leaves.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY GATE - NIGHT 52
Sam walks toward the cemetery entrance.

Hipsters carry cheese plates, blankets and wine through the
iron gate.

Sam walks alone down a grave-lined path.
The air has cooled...

Pretty young women walk through the cemetery in their summer
clothes.

Orchestral score echoes - as though performed through a
loudspeaker.

Dialogue from a film soundtrack carries across the graveyard.
Source unseen.

We hear reverb-filled voices. Much like the hollow sounds
heard when stepping into the back of a large movie theater
mid-screening.

As Sam steps over the hill, he sees hundreds of people sitting
on the grass before a make-shift movie screen. A film is being
projected onto the back wall of a mausoleum.

Picnic blankets and lawn chairs fill the space.
Sam steps to the rear of the crowd, and watches the film.

A quiet scene in some suburban backyard. A young mid-western
girl smokes a cigarette and flirts with a teenage boy. Her
friend watches from a lawn chair opposite her. The pixie girl
with the Seberg-haircut flashes a star-making smile.

Sam looks through the crowd. No one familiar.

He makes his way toward a tree-lined path, glancing back at
the film.

Onscreen, a pig-tailed teen girl frowns while talking to her
boyfriend. Sad but photogenic eyes. Her soft voice echos
across the graveyard.

Sam notices a man with a diamond grill smoking pot with two
pretty young women. He has his arms around them like trophies.
They lean together against a thick-stump tombstone.

DIAMOND GRILL
(laughing in distance)
Two for one month, right?

Walking closer along the path, Sam recognizes them.

It's the two girls from the movie. Older now, but recognizably
the same. A regular pair of SHOOTING STARS.

Their hair is styled exactly as it is in the film being shown
tonight. Their attire is nearly inappropriate - like some bad
hipster variations on Jodie Foster's wardrobe from Taxi
Driver.

Hey. You're the girls. In the movie.

SHOOTING STAR #2 flips a pig tail over her shoulder and takes
a puff from the joint.

SHOOTING STAR #1
Yeah.

SHOOTING STAR #2
That's us.

The girls smile and stare at Sam through stoned eyes.

DIAMOND GRILL ignores him, smoking his joint and touching the
girls' faces.

SAM
Nice to meet you.

SHOOTING STAR #2
Thank you.

SHOOTING STAR #1 smiles and nods, looking down at the ground
with a shy shuffle. Her short Seberg-hair catches the light.

SHOOTING STAR #1
Do you like the movie?

SAM

Um... yeah... I just got here, but I'm
sure it's...

Shooting Star #2 notices a scent wafting by. She sniffs the
air - interrupting.

SHOOTING STAR #2
Gosh, do ya smell that?

Sam takes a deep breath.

SHOOTING STAR #1
Smells like skunks and... pot

The Seberg-girl displays an exaggerated grimace. Too pouty for
a grown woman.

SAM
Los Angeles is filled with skunks.
Especially the east side.

DIAMOND GRILL

SHOOTING STAR #1
Ok.

Diamond Grill leads them toward a limousine, parked along the
inner drive. They stumble in their heels, under the influence.

Sam watches them climb inside, slumping together across
leather seats. Light music emanates.

A man's head peeks out from within the dark limo.

It's the Hipster Pirate. Sam reacts - taking a step closer.
The door shuts.

Slam!

The limousine accelerates down the cemetery road, disappearing
around the corner.

Behind Sam, on the mausoleum wall, the short haired girl
smiles and flirts with a small town boy.

EXT. CEMETERY MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT 54
Sam walks up to a TUXEDO BOUNCER standing before a roped-off
doorway. Potted plants and Saint statues flank the edges of
this marble entrance.
An elegantly designed cardboard floor-sign announces:

Summertime Secret Show!

The rumble of music can be heard from inside.

Sam holds up his cookie invitation. Tuxedo Bouncer examines it
and nods his head.

He eyes Sam with displeasure.
TUXEDO BOUNCER

You gotta take a bite before I can let

you in.
Sam looks at the bouncer's face. He's quite serious.
Sam shrugs and shoves the entire cookie in his mouth.

the large mausoleum hall. Waitresses carry drinks and hors

Looking over heads and shoulders, Sam sees the small stage
near a row of shrines. Spotlights illuminate the main
attraction.

Meek Bride stands on the stage, dressed in her 20's gown and
80's tennis shoes.

She leans forward and speaks quietly into the microphone like
a cute mouse - nervously pressing her dress down onto her
knees.

MEEK BRIDE
Thank you everybody for being here. I
want to dedicate this first song to
the man who taught me everything I
know. This song is for Jesus.

The small piece orchestra sitting in the shadows of the stage
begin to play. A sad and slow version of a famous tune.

To Sir With Love...

MEEK BRIDE
(singing)
Those schoolgirl days of telling tales
and biting nails are gone. But in my
mind I know they will still live on
and on...

The men in the room watch with wistful eyes and deep longing.
Sam watches the Bride perform, simultaneously eyeing the
crowd.

MEEK BRIDE
(singing)
But how do you thank someone who has
taken you from crayons to perfume? It
isn't easy, but I'll try...

Sam hears a woman's voice behind him...

RECORD GIRL
Records?... Records?... Records?

Sam turns and sees RECORD GIRL handing out sample albums to
the party-goers. Record Girl wears a 1930's cigarette girl
outfit - carrying a wooden tray filled with double stacked 45s
of the newest Jesus and the Brides of Dracula single. She's
straight out of Cocoanut Grove.

The girl holds her tray of records out before Sam - offering
him one.

On stage, Meek Bride continues to sing like a sad angel.

MEEK BRIDE

If you wanted the sky, I would write
across the sky in letters that would
soar a thousand feet high.... to sir

Making his way to the bar, Sam notices his friend Allen
chatting with a cute bartender. He walks up and shakes the

man's hand.
SAM
How's it going?
ALLEN
Work is good. Floatin' along. You
know.
SAM

Yeah. I get it.
Sam signals the bartender. She leans in.
SAM

(to bartender)
Jack on the rocks, please.

ALLEN
You find those girls you were lookin'
for?

SAM
No. Not yet.

ALLEN

I'll keep an eye out. Three hot girls

Sam smiles and nods. He passes some cash to the bartender and
sips his drink.

Um... have you noticed anything
strange going on in this whole circle

ALLEN
That's kind of everyday, right?
SAM
No. I know. I mean... extra strange.
ALLEN
Last week, this girl I hooked up
with... she was fucked up out of her
mind... said some weird stuff about

Jesus and the Brides.

SAM
Like what?

Allen looks around, then leans in close to Sam.

ALLEN
That there's a message in the music.

Allen grins, tapping his finger on the record in Sam's hand.

Sam glances at the sleeve. Jesus and the Brides pose together
like a post-modern perfume ad.

SAM
Like a secret message?

Allen smiles, laughing about the idea.

ALLEN
Uh huh.

SAM
What's it say?

ALLEN
I don't have a clue, man.

SAM
Who's this girl?

ALLEN
Just one of the many. You know.

passing by. Allen waves and smiles, stepping away from Sam to
engage his friends in a series of complicated hand shakes and
man hugs.

Sam watches Allen disappear into the crowd.
MEEK BRIDE

I would rather you let me give my

heart... to sir with looooove...
Balloon Girl bumps against Sam, wearing an Italian-chic summer
dress with sandals - looking like an object of infatuation
from an old Rohmer film from the mid 70's.

She leans against the bar - her bare shoulder touching Sam's
arm. He looks at her face.

SAM
I hardly recognized you without your
balloons.
Balloon girl shakes her head with a small grin.

BALLOON GIRL
You saw that?

SAM
Uh huh.

The pretty girl points at the drink in Sam's hand.

BALLOON GIRL
Would you buy me one?

Sure.

BALLOON GIRL
Yeah.

Sam shows Balloon Girl his photo of Sarah, setting it down on
the bar.

SAM
Did you ever see her around?

Balloon Girl nods her head. Yup.

BALLOON GIRL
Sarah.

SAM
You know what happened to her?

Sam hands Balloon Girl her whiskey. She takes a drink.

BALLOON GIRL
Come with me.

Balloon Girl grabs Sam's hand and pulls him through the crowd.

SAM
Where are we going?

BALLOON GIRL
The basement.

INT. MAUSOLEUM STAIRWELL - NIGHT 56

Balloon Girl hops down the stone steps, dragging Sam behind
her.

BALLOON GIRL

tiny slot opens, revealing a peering eye.

INT. CRYPT CLUB - NIGHT 57

Cigarette smoke fills the cavernous crypt club. Rough stone
walls, curtained booths, and tombstone tables surround the
dance floor.

Music thumps as the crowd hops and sways to a classic pop
tune. Something recognizable from the 1990's.

Sam and Balloon Girl are sitting together at one of the tables
- their drinks and elbows resting on a perfect replica of
Jayne Mansfield's tombstone.

The pair share a cigarette - taking turns with their drags.
They shout over the painfully loud music. Conversing!

BALLOON GIRL

(looking at Sarah's

photo)
I didn't know her very well, but she
was around! I saw her at parties and
shows and stuff! I don't know what
happened to her, but I can tell you it
didn't have anything to do with my
friends! We're just enjoying our
world, enjoying our bodies, enjoying
our music... !

Sam holds up his 45 record, displaying the cover of Jesus and
the Brides. He points to it as he talks.

SAM
I heard people saying that there's
some kind of code or secret message in
their music!

Balloon Girl laughs.

BALLOON GIRL
I'm pretty sure that's not true! Jesus
wouldn't hide a message in a message!

Sam says nothing as he nods. He takes a drag of his cigarette.
Ballon girl slides the photo across the table to him.

BALLOON GIRL
There's nothing to solve, you know?!
It's silly to put so much energy into
something that doesn't matter!

Balloon Girl reaches into her dress and pulls out a piece of
flaccid red rubber. She holds the balloon up to her mouth and
blows into it.

BALLOON GIRL
We have this tiny window where we can
have fun and fuck and and be
free... !

Tying it off with her fingers, the girl raises up the inflated
balloon and moves her cigarette closer and closer to it.

BALLOON GIRL
Life is too short, right?!

Balloon Girl presses the cigarette against the rubber, popping
the balloon in her hand. She smiles to Sam.

Sam takes a gulp of his drink, eyeing Balloon Girl with
curiosity.

A powerful and loud power chord blasts from the club's
speakers.

It's REM's "What's the Frequency Kenneth".

SAM
Come on! I wanna dance to this!

BALLOON GIRL
I don't know this song!

SAM
Come on!

On the dance floor, under the strobing lights, the pair begin
to feel the music. The energy of it.

SAM
(singing along! )
I'd studied your cartoons, radio,
music, TV, movies, magazines...
Richard said, "Withdrawal in disgust
is not the same as apathy"...

Sam dances wildly to the song - a giant grin rarely seen in
the context of this story. He dances, jumps and swings his
arms like a whirling and mad Michael Stipe. The girl laughs
joyfully along with Sam.

"What's the frequency, Kenneth?" is

Sam dances and stares into the girl's beautiful but young
face. She moves to the beat... though clearly unfamiliar with
the tune or the lyrics he's chanting. Sam is the only one
singing along, but he doesn't care.

They are separated by age and the ever shifting tectonic
plates of pop culture.

The dance floor is half full. Most of the crowd sways casual
and cool. Sam and Balloon Girl smile and jump, shaking along
with the heavily tremoloed chords - using their power to
remain unique and alive.

BALLOON GIRL
We should fuck!

SAM
Yes!

Sam's world grows large. The crowd twists and transforms.
Color stretches into unbelievable hues.

Sam grabs his face. Rubs his eyes. His legs grow weak.

He turns and staggers off the dance floor. Balloon Girl

BALLOON GIRL

Fuck me.

Near the entrance, he sees Troy, one of the Rabbit convertible
girls.

As he steps closer, focusing his eyes, Troy spots him and

pushes through the crowd - rushing out the door. Sam follows -
picking up the pace.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY - NIGHT 60
Sam chases the girl through the dark cemetery.

SAM
Hey! Wait!

Troy is quick. She darts between the graves and trees. Sam
dodges and leaps in pursuit.

A long stretch of open grass separates them. Sam kicks into
high gear. His breathing intensifies. Sweat everywhere.

He gets closer and closer, staring ahead at the girl sprinting
along in her jean shorts.

Everything starts to slow down... turning purple... then
black...

Sam falls to the ground - holding his head.

Darkness.

Morning birds chirp.

SAM
It's not hooked up, but I have one. If
you send the tape, I can watch it.

Old women and old men walk through the cemetery with somber
expressions. Their clothes and outfits are identical matches
to several of the outfits worn by the young women and men in
this same place the night before.

All these old hats and colorful slacks... utility over

fashion...

MOM
Oh good. I just thought it would be
something nice to share. She's soooo

Demonic? Certainly odd. No words or messages.
Sam listens. Staring at the speakers across from him.

Mario Bros on the 8-bit Nintendo. Sam is flipping through a
stack of old Nintendo Power Magazines - reading about cheats

BAR BUDDY
I know that book.

Bar Buddy points at Sam's "Code-Breakers" book sitting next to
the old lyric-covered pizza box.

SAM
Yeah. I stole that from the library
when I was ten years old. I thought it
was the coolest thing ever.

Bar Buddy listens, guiding his Luigi across the side-scrolling
world.

SAM
I just remember sitting in my room,
and making up my own weird little
codes and secret language... it felt
like there was so much mystery in the
world... things to be figured out and
solved...

The friend nods. He understands and relates.

An entire generation of men obsessed
with video games, secret codes, and
space aliens.

Bar Buddy's Luigi is hit by a twirling hammer

Sam continues playing, making a complicated series of jumps.

BAR BUDDY
Listen, a hundred years ago, any idiot

behind a rock and find something
new... but not now.

Mario hits a hidden block. A fire flower grows from within it.

BAR BUDDY
Where is the thing that's never been

worth while?

Sam controls his character, destroying several Goombas and a
Piranha Plant with his fireballs.

BAR BUDDY
Why do you think so many of us are out
looking for the fucking Loch Ness
monster? Aliens? Bigfoot? We don't
want to accept that we're useless.
Even though we are. Modern Man needs
mystery. We need to believe that
there's something worth finding.

On screen, Sam's Mario sinks down into a secret green sewer
pipe - accompanied by a sound effect - the sound of discovery.

catalogue, an Urban Outfitters catalogue, Sarah's photo, a

People magazine, and an open Hustler on the bed around him.

He starts to masturbate, flipping through the newest LA
weekly.

Sam stares at an image of the Brides of Dracula. Their eyes
appear to stare back at him. A sexual understanding between a
photograph and a man.

Sam strokes himself, glancing at the other images...

A naked Penny Baker from 1984...

A submerged and nude Carol Willis from 1970...

A modern supermodel in a purple bra...

A sardonic hippy chick in tight red jeans...

Sarah in her white hat...

Mrs. Sevence and Millicent, crying on the cover of People...

A giant breasted porn star...

Continuing to pleasure himself, Sam flips the pages of the LA
Weekly to the smut section in the back of the paper.

Strippers and whores. Phone numbers for escorts and sex chat.
Sam notices a quarter page advertisement featuring the smiling
faces of several pretty young women. Different than the
average stripper or sex ad. Sam looks down at the girls'
faces. He's seen these girls before.

Very short hair on one. Pigtails on the other

It's the two Shooting Star girls from the cemetery movie.

Sam stops jerking off and examines the ad more closely. It
reads:

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 66

Sam presses play on his CD player. "Modern Love" by David
Bowie plays loudly. Sam sways along with the beat.

SAM
(singing along)
I know when to go out... and when to
stay in... get things done...

Sam dances to his door. He opens it and leans outside. No
one's there.

Leaving the door ajar, Sam steps back into his apartment. He
grabs a beer from the fridge while dancing to the tune.

SAM
(singing along)
I catch a paper boy, but things don't
really change. I'm standing in the
wind, but I never wave bye-bye... but
Itry... I try...

Sipping from the can, Sam dances back to the doorway. He peeks
out again and sees Shooting Star #1, the short-haired ingenue,
walking delicately into the lamp light towards his front door

Shooting Star #1 sees Sam and smiles with a little wave. She's
dressed provocatively in a white dress.

SHOOTING STAR #1
Hey! It's you.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67

"Modern Love" is still playing. Sam sits on the couch watching
the young woman wander around his living room. Shooting Star
#1 looks at the knick knacks and posters, running her hand
over things.... examining and admiring the oddities. Sam
stares at her as she stands on tiptoes to see the books on his
shelf.

SAM
(singing along quietly)
God and Man, no confessions...
God and Man, no religion...
God and Man, don't believe in...
Modern Love...

Nothing.

SHOOTING STAR #1
I mean for work.

SAM
Oh God... that's all I ever hear.
How's work? Workin' hard? Works good?

Shooting Star #1 rolls her eyes.

SHOOTING STAR #1
People have to work.

Sam nods, turning down the music with the remote.

SAM
Aren't you in movies though? Why are
you doing this?

SHOOTING STAR #1
You know, I made one little indie
movie - didn't make a penny off it. I
moved out and here and I was
waitressing. I could barely pay rent.
You know how expensive it is here?

SAM
I do.

The young woman begins to unbutton her dress with a grin...

SHOOTING STAR #1
(putting on a show)
You want a blow job from the
supporting actress Academy Award
nominee from last year? Call Shooting
Star.

She starts to shift and pull down on her cotton dress.
SHOOTING STAR #1

With her her bra strap revealed, the girl points at Sam.

SHOOTING STAR #1
Youuuu are a patron of the arts... and
I can pay my bills.

Sam laughs. The Shooting Star smiles and laughs along. She
pulls her dress down, stepping over it with her heels.

SHOOTING STAR #1
You gave them your credit card, right?

The young woman stands before Sam in her bra and panties.

SAM
Uh huh.

Shooting Star #1 walks over to Sam. She leans forward and rubs
her hands through his hair - her chest close to his face.

SAM
Can I ask you something?

SHOOTING STAR #1
(whispering)
Shhhhhhhh.

Shooting Star #1 rubs her hands down Sam's head to his back
and shoulders. The young woman sways a bit to the music.

SAM
It's nothing bad... I was wondering...
last night at the cemetery... who was
the pirate-looking guy in the limo?

SHOOTING STAR #1
I have no idea.

The girl lowers herself down against Sam. Brushing her leg
against his crotch. She moves slowly, shifting into some form
of a lap dance.

SAM
You don't know his name?

The short haired beauty continues to rotate her body in minor
circles - slightly seductive pivots.

SHOOTING STAR #1
No. He was... anonymous.

SAM
You don't know anything about him?

SHOOTING STAR #1
Eh eh.

Shooting Star #1 stares directly at Sam, offering him a sweet
and innocent look of naivete. A shoulder shrug and a pout.

SHOOTING STAR #1
You have any food?

SAM
There's pizza in the fridge.

The girl opens the fridge and pulls a slice from the cardboard
box inside. She scans the photos and pictures hanging from
Magnets along the door of the icebox.

Taking a bite of pizza, Shooting Star #1 looks at a production
photo from "Something's Got to Give". In it, Marilyn Monroe
swims nude in a very blue pool - staring back at the camera
with seductive eyes.

Sam watches the girl from across the room as she notices
something else on the counter. Shooting Star #1 lifts up the
photo of Sarah, holding it out toward Sam.

SHOOTING STAR #1
I know this girl.

SAM
Really? How do you know her?

SHOOTING STAR #1
She was at this party I went toa
couple years ago.

Shooting Star #1 walks over, bringing the picture with her.
She sits down next to Sam, gobbling her food.

SAM
Did you talk to her?

SHOOTING STAR #1
No. That would've been impossible.

The girl laughs and continues.

SHOOTING STAR #1
She was in this glass cube in the
middle of a living room. Some kind of
bad performance art I guess. She was
just sitting on a stool in a dalmation
fur bathing suit. Not moving or making
eye contact. These drunk old men kept
tapping the glass but she wouldn't
budge.

SAM
How did you end up there?

Shooting Star runs her hand over Sam's lap. She flirts and
teases as she talks.

SHOOTING STAR #1
This asshole producer. He brought me
and a few other girls as his dates.

SAM
What's his name?

SHOOTING STAR #1
I don't remember... he makes those big
action movies based on household
cleaning products.

SAM
Ok. I know who you're talking about.

Shooting Star #1 lays back, putting her head in Sam's lap.

SHOOTING STAR #1
So we get to this place and they let
us in the gate. They check our ID's,
we just wander the streets of this
luxury neighborhood... walking into
whatever house we want, whatever room
we want. There's food everywhere.
Music. Dancers. Craziness. It was this
big open party, like straight outta
Gatsby.

SAM
Wow. Who's place was it?

SHOOTING STAR #1
No one ever said. It was really weird.
But at the end of the block, the
biggest house on the block, this grey
stone mansion...

Shooting Star presses her head back against Sam's crotch with
a knowing grin. She rolls her head in place.

SHOOTING STAR #1
When I was cleaning up in the
bathroom, I heard some girls gossiping
about the place. One of 'em said she'd
heard it was owned by some songwriter

SAM
Must've been some song.

SHOOTING STAR #1
No shit.

The pair begin to kiss.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - MORNING 68
Sam sits on his balcony with his Martin acoustic guitar. He

strums a few familiar chords, then glances down at the lyric-
covered pizza box.

Sam takes his sharpie and scribbles the chord-names above the
lyrics.

It's the music for "Turning Teeth" by Jesus and the Brides of
Dracula.

Across the courtyard, Topless Bird Woman washes her patio door
with windex. Her parrot caws loudly.

PARROT
Luddafemmmbbbbbb!

Sam moves his fingers over the fret board. He strums lightly -
bringing the song to life.

Sam begins to sing or half-sing the words...
SAM
You and I... turning like teeth...
loving beneath... the surface...
Stopping again, Sam stares down at his fingers - stretched

across the frets. He repeats the pattern, arpeggiating the
chords, and watching his finger placement.

Sam jumps up and moves inside his apartment.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Sitting on the floor, and using another pizza box as a sketch
pad, Sam writes out the chords as tablature. He simply writes
out the chord formations in a numeric form in reference to
their place on the fret board.

Sam counts off the numbers as he moves through the various
parts of the song - jotting each down on the box.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY
Sam lays on the couch. Holding the tablature-filled pizza box
over his head. He stares up at the numbers, turning the box in
a circle. Looking for a way in.
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY
Sam sits near the window reading "The Code-Breakers". The
turntable is on, playing the 45 once more. He flips a page and
looks down at the Chapter Heading:
The Anatomy of Cryptology
Sam continues to read.
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - LATE DAY
Sitting on the carpet, with the guitar in his lap, Sam lifts
up the 45 record sleeve. He looks at Jesus and the Brides
then turns it over, examining the track listing and liner
notes.
Sam looks at the first number on his box. It's the number 3.
He looks back at the liner notes. Starting from the first
letter of the first word, Sam counts forward three letters. He
ends up on the letter R. Sam writes this down on the box.
R
Looking to the next number, he repeats the process, moving
through the chords and the words on the record sleeve. A
message begins to form.
RUB D

Faster and faster, Sam moves through the words, counting in.
He's deeper and closer than before.

As he works, Jesus and the Brides sing their beautiful melody.

Sam scratches his marker across the cardboard...
Finally...

He stops. Sam looks down at the pizza box... at the message
below him...

RUB DEANS HEAD AND WAIT UNDER NEWTON

Sam stares at the message scribbled in sharpie. A mix of print
and cursive.

SAM
(to himself)
Rub deans head and wait under newton?
What the fuck does that mean?

Sam stands up and rubs his head. He walks to the glass patio
door and looks out. He stares at the Topless Bird Woman as she
cleans one of the many cages.

Sam leans close and breathes against the glass. A small circle
of moisture forms near his nose and mouth.

SAM
Dean... Dean Martin. Dean Koontz.
Harry Dean Stanton. Richard Dean
Anderson. Dean Stockwell. James Dean.

Sam ponders his thoughts. Considers the possibilities. Tapping
his fingers against the glass.

An idea forms. Sam looks up past the trees to the blue sky
above.

SAM
James Dean's head. Hah!

Sam grins to himself, nodding.
EXT. GRIFFITH PARK TRAIL - LATE DAY 73

The landscape is wide and bright under the late afternoon sun.
Sam walks alone up a dusty trail surrounded by wild grass.

Here in the hills, the city is below him. So much blue sky
overhead.

Sam looks up toward the gleaming white structure at the hill's
peak. The Griffith Observatory.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY COURTYARD - LATE DAY 74
Emerging from the steep bank along the front of the
Observatory, Sam looks across the serene courtyard filled with
tourists and day trippers.
He approaches the James Dean statue along the side wall,
facing the Hollywood sign. Sam stands before the bust
commemorating "Rebel without a Cause". He looks from side to
side. Is anyone watching?

SAM

(whispering to himself)
Rub Dean's head...

Sam reaches out and places his hand on James Dean's head. He
rubs the statue, looking around for some kind of reaction.
Nothing seems to happen. Sam rubs it once more for luck.
Turning around, Sam steps up to the Astronomer's Monument
across from the main entrance. He circles the stone pillar
reading the name's around the base.
Copernicus... Galileo... Kepler...
Newton...
Sam stop and stares at the marble figure representing Newton.

SAM

(whispering to himself)
Rub Dean's head and sit under Newton.

Sam smiles to himself and shrugs as he sits down on the grass,
leaning his back against the base of the monument.

He sits and watches the tourists and local visitors pass.
Families and young people. The sun shines brightly.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY COURTYARD - DUSK 75
Sam rests against the statue. His head is slumped to the side.

The horizon is now a purple and orange swathe of cotton.

The courtyard is nearly empty.

From the hillside, Sam notices a dirty old homeless man

walking toward him. The HOMELESS KING stops in front of Sam
and looks down.

lap.
HOMELESS KING
Put that over your eyes and I'll bring
you where you're looking to go.

SAM
Who are you?

HOMELESS KING
I'm the Homeless King.

SAM
Really?

HOMELESS KING
Yes.

We watch from a distance as Sam ties the blindfold over his

eyes. The Homeless King offers an arm, helping him stand. The

two men make their way slowly toward the trails, arm in arm.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK TRAIL - DUSK 76

The Homeless King leads Sam down the hillside. Sam walks
tentatively, still blindfolded by the dirty rag.

SAM
Where are we going?

Sam's feet slip on the loose dirt. The old man keeps him
steady.

HOMELESS KING
Just concentrate on walking, ok?

SAM
Ok.

A woman jogger passes the men without a second glance. Music
blasts from her headphones.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK WOODS - DUSK 77

Moving through a patch of large trees, the Homeless King
guides Sam over the grass.

They step very slowly - the gentle snapping of twigs and the
crunching of leaves under the darkening sky.

HOMELESS KING
Some people don't realize this about

themselves, but... you don't have a
good smell about you. Did you know
that?

SAM

I did know that. But thank you.
They shuffle along - deeper into the forest.
78 EXT. GRIFFITH PARK CLEARING - DUSK 78

A family wraps up their food from a nearby picnic table. The
site of a child's birthday party.

A few balloons, tied to a bucket, drift in the evening breeze.

No one pays any attention to the blindfolded man and his flea-
bitten guide.

The Homeless King leads Sam past a tipped-over trash can. A
small coyote digs through the waste - his nose sifting through
old hot dog buns and Zesty Taco Doritos.

Sam hears the animal howling nearby.

SAM
Is that a dog?

HOMELESS KING
It's a coyote.

SAM
It's not gonna bite me, right?

HOMELESS KING
No. Coyotes are blessed creatures. If
you ever find yourself alone with a
coyote, you don't run away... you
follow it and see where it takes you.
Sam says nothing. They continue to walk.

INT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80
The Homeless King stands behind Sam, leading him deeper.
HOMELESS KING
Everything belongs to the coyotes.
They're just letting us use it.

The Homeless King pulls the blindfold off of Sam's face.

Sam looks around. He's standing inside a dim stone corridor. A
narrow tunnel descends deep into darkness.

Behind the homeless guide, Sam sees a patch of evening light
pouring in from the small hatch. The forest is beyond.

SAM
Where are we?

The Homeless King exhales.

HOMELESS KING
You know I can't tell you that.

SAM
Sure. Of course.

HOMELESS KING
Ok. Well...

The Homeless King extends his arm out, suggesting that Sam
begin his descent.

SAM
This way?
The old man nods his head as Sam walks down the sloping stone
tunnel. He runs his hands along the wall as he moves further
from the entrance.

Intermittent floor-lights, cemented into the wall, illuminate
his path.

The hatch closes with a clang. Sam glances back. The Homeless
King is gone.

Sam turns and continues deeper into the tunnel.

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 81

Sam follows the chiseled path. The stone walls open up a bit -
continuing to descend.

INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT 82
Sam turns a corner and sees a long expanse of branching

tunnels. Each dropping lower into darkness. Sam chooses one

and walks deeper.

He begins to reach additional pathways and optional turns.

It resembles a maze.

Looking to his sides, Sam sees long expanses of square-cut
tunnels sweeping into the earth.

Concrete corridors similar to those found at a sports stadium.
He turns a corner... and then another...

All sense of direction is lost. Earthen walls and sloping
floors.

Finally... Sam sees a large stone doorway ahead.

INT. LARGE TUNNEL ROOM - NIGHT 83
Entering the enormous room, Sam is surrounded by roughly

painted dry wall, exposed rebar, construction markings, and
nail-filled wooden beams.

In the center of the room is a long dining table with no
chairs. It's covered in the dust of concrete.

Thick wooden crates line the inner wall. They are labeled as
such...

Food. Water. Batteries. Towels. Liquor

Walking further into the giant space, Sam passes a roughed-out
kitchen area with a massive refrigerator

A generator is visible behind an unfinished wall.

Inside the bathroom is a tub with gold fixtures, a shower and
a dead-end pipe - plumbing for an eventual toilet.

Stepping into a third concrete-walled room, Sam sees a spray-
painted mark on the floor, designating the location for a bed.
A giant recess in the wall suggests the inclusion of some
large format television.

Sam follows a long corridor upwards. Each tired step brings
him closer to some sort of imagined surface.

Higher and higher he walks through the stone tunnels. His face
is weary.

INT. TIGHT CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT 85
Sam inches his way through a dark shaft. His arms are pinned

close to the narrow side walls. Sharp-cut stone rubs against

his shoulders.

A tiny speck of light is visible ahead.

He hears music. Muzak?

INT. GELSON'S DAIRY COOLER - MORNING 86

Sam's hand rises up from between the metal floor grates. Milk
cartons and frosted dairy racks litter the chilled cooler

Sam lifts the grate up and sets it aside on the tile. He
climbs out of the tight crawl-space and looks around.

It's a supermarket. Fucking Gelson's. Sam laughs to himself.

Muzak plays from the store speakers: a softened, instrumental
version of Jesus and the Bride's of Dracula's hit single.

Sam puts the floor grate back in place, and snatches a bottle
of milk. Exhausted and thirsty, he takes a big drink

INT. GELSON'S SUPERMARKET - MORNING 87

Sam wipes off his milk mustache as he stumbles through a
bright aisle of food - milk bottle in hand.

EXT. COMIC MAN'S STREET - MORNING 88

Sam sees a police car parked in Comic Man's driveway. He
stares at it, while approaching the front porch.

wrong with him.
Sam nods. What else can he say?
EXT. COMIC MAN'S STREET - MORNING 89
Further down the street, Sam hides behind some bushes - spying
on the police. He watches the cop car pull out of the driveway
and cruise off.

Sam cuts behind some hedges, sneaking into the nearest
backyard.

EXT. COMIC MAN'S BACKYARD - MORNING 90
Sam pries open Comic Man's kitchen window.
INT. COMIC MAN'S BEDROOM - MORNING 91

Sam stands in the doorway of the bedroom. The sheets are
covered in blood stains. The bed appears wet.

Removing the secret panel from the wall, Sam crouches before
the security monitors and VCR.

He starts to rewind the tape.

Waiting, Sam notices the Moonstones cereal box sitting near
the monitor. He glances at the East Los Angeles map on back

Treasure Hunt! Fun Prizes!

security camera footage.

An onscreen clock reads:

Dull shots of dim and empty rooms. Nothing happening.
Something catches Sam's eye. There's movement on the screen.

A woman climbs through the side window of the living room -
feet and legs first. The movement of a dancer

SAM
Ohhhh fuck.

Sam watches the monitor - transfixed and disturbed by the odd
image.

Onscreen is a beautiful woman - naked except for her owl-skin
cap, red lipstick and overgrown bush.

The OWL'S KISS walks carefully, nearly creeping across the
living room. She steps out of frame on her way to the bedroom.

Sam stares in surprise and a bit of horror

He rewinds the tape, watching the Owl's Kiss enter one more
time. A dangling foot connected to a face of taxidermied bird
skin.

Sam presses PAUSE - freezing the naked figure mid-step - in
all her disturbing glory.

EXT. COMIC MAN'S STREET - MORNING 92

Gripping the old Moonstones cereal box in his hand, Sam rushes
down the street - frightened. He appears more mad than usual
by the light of day.

Sam holds his cell phone up to his ear

SAM

Sam steps quickly - eyes darting around the serene
neighborhood.

INT. ALLEN'S CAR - MORNING 93

Still in the same clothes, looking sweaty and terrible, Sam
sits in the passenger seat of Allen's beat-up Ford Focus.
Allen turns the car, driving into a rich neighborhood off
Hillhurst.

ALLEN
He's just some cable tv actor who
likes to have people around... throws
these chess parties... with hot chicks
and guys who like to play chess.

Allen pulls up in front of a modest white mansion near the
Greek Theater.

A BATHING BEAUTY leads Sam and Allen through the large
backyard to a small chess table near the pool.

CONTINUED: 94

Everyone sits poolside at small tables with chess boards.
Pretty girls and handsome guys. Moving Pawns and Pieces.

Old school bathing beauties deliver drinks to the players.
Mimosas and other fun late morning cocktails.

A few girls swim in the pool. Aware of their beauty and not
concerned with privacy or modesty, they talk and laugh freely.

Allen moves his Pawn forward. King's Pawn to E4. Sam glances
at the board and moves his pawn to A6.

ALLEN
That's a terrible move.

Sam grabs a mimosa from a passing waitress. He sips the drink
as he scans the yard. Allen stares down at the board, debating
and analyzing.

Sam sees the Shooting Star girls, both #1 and #2, seated
alongside a chess table with two handsome young men.

Looking further, he sees Meek Bride and Reading Glasses Bride
sitting Indian-style on the grass - a checkered board and
cheese plate between them. In their lace gowns, they are
polished bohemian perfection.

Then... Sam spots Jesus at a small chess table, engaged ina
game with the third and last of the Brides - Clara Bow Bride.

Jesus is ever-shirtless. Eternally handsome and miraculously
thin.

Sam stares for a moment. Debating his next move.

Sam notices a RED BALLOON floating over the pool past his
view. It's connected to a long ribbon tied to the wrist of
Balloon Girl. She's sitting on the far side of the pool,
playing a game of chess with Emerald Beauty.

Sam waves to Balloon Girl and she smiles in his direction, but
quickly turns her attention back to the game.

Allen moves his Knight to F3, nodding to himself, but still
debating his choice.

Sam watches as Jesus stands from his chair and walks toward
the main house. A lanky and sexual strut.

Sam takes a gulp from his mimosa and sets it on the table,
moving his Knight forward to C6.

SAM
I'll be right back.

Yup.

Sam follows Jesus, walking toward the back door of the

Mansion. Allen stares at the Pieces and Pawns shaking his

head.

INT. MODEST MANSION - MORNING 95

Sam watches Jesus step into the rear bathroom. He closes the
old mahogany door.

Sam walks straight down the hall, opens the door and steps
inside.

INT. MANSION BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 96

Jesus is on the toilet with his pants around his ankles. He
looks up at Sam.

JESUS
What the fuck man?! I'm takin' a shit!

Sam says nothing. He closes the door and grabs the skinny man
by the neck, pushing him onto the floor.

JESUS
Get the fuck off me!

Sam punches Jesus in the stomach, silencing him quickly. The
man gasps for air as Sam hovers over him - fists shaking.

SAM
Why did you put a code in the song?

JESUS
What are you talking about?

Two men in a strange position on the bathroom rug.

Jesus says nothing, turning his head away, trying to avoid the
situation.

JESUS
Help.

Sam grabs his thin arm and bends it backwards, twisting it at
the elbow.

SAM
Fucking tell me!

Jesus sobs and writhes in pain.

JESUS
I don't know anything about a code.

Sam twists harder.

JESUS
Ahhhhhhh.

SAM
How could you not know? You wrote the

JESUS
No. I didn't. I wrote most of the
songs, but not that one.

SAM
So all the hits?

Jesus looks back - pissed.

JESUS
There's no reason to belittle me, man.

Sam ignores his reply, twisting him arm back a bit more.

JESUS
Ahhhhhhh.

SAM
So who wrote the songs?

JESUS
They were delivered anonymously. I got
a call from somebody at the label.
They weren't bullshitting. They knew
everybody and everything that
mattered. They said not to ask anyone
about it, but that I needed to record
the songs or I'd lose my contract. I
believed him.

SAM
You have no idea who wrote your own
hit song? They didn't say anything?

JESUS
He never gave me a name. No. He just
said that it was an important piece of
music by the songwriter.

SAM
Thee songwriter?

JESUS
Yeah. The songwriter.

Sam considers this for a moment. Jesus stares up at him with
tears on his face - his mascara streaking down over his cheek

EXT. BACKYARD POOL - MORNING 97

Near the bath house, Balloon Girl is chatting with Shooting
Stars #1 and #2 - all dressed in their cute bathing suits and
matching shawls. The girls notice Sam approaching fast. He
appears hyper-focused and disheveled.

Sam grabs Shooting Star #1 by the arm and pulls her aside.
Balloon Girl and Shooting Star #2 hover nearby - concerned.

SAM
Hey...
SHOOTING STAR #1
What is it?
SAM
Remember the party you told me about?
The gated neighborhood owned by some
songwriter? Could you take me there?
SHOOTING STAR #1
Uh huh.
EXT. ABERDEEN AVENUE - MORNING 98

Sam walks with the girls, passing by another beautiful mansion
- a long stretch of perfect green grass. The girls wear their
bathing suits and matching shawls. Clickety clacking in their

heels.

Sam is in yesterday's clothes - sweat stained and soiled.

SAM
So how do you all know each other?

BALLOON GIRL
We're roommates...

SHOOTING STAR #1
And we work together.

SAM
Oh.

SHOOTING STAR #2
We're all Shooting Stars.

Sam looks over at Balloon Girl. She strides down the sidewalk
with young confidence.

SAM
(to Balloon Girl)
You too?
BALLOON GIRL
Yeah.

SAM
I didn't know you were an actress.

BALLOON GIRL
I was on a soap opera between the ages
of 5 and 6 months.

SAM
Are we getting close?

SHOOTING STAR #1
It's not far from here.

EXT. CANYON ROAD - DAY 99

Sam and the girls stand before a giant stone wall lining a
long stretch of some unmarked canyon road. They hug and say
their goodbyes.

Walking away, Balloon Girl waves to Sam as he begins to climb
the wall.

EXT. GATED CANYON SUBURB - DAY 100

Peeking out of the trees, Sam sees a wide and perfect suburban
street. Several giant houses dot the road. No people or cars
in sight.

Sam walks through the neighborhood. It's like a ghost town. He
passes deserted estate houses moving through the canyon
valley... tarp and plastic over furniture and empty parlor
rooms.

Rounding the bend, Sam sees a large stone mansion at the base
of the hill - reminiscent of Hearst Castle.

Sam sneaks closer.
EXT. STONE MANSION - CONTINUOUS 101

Sam walks around back through the trees discovering a Greek
pillared pool and grotto.

Towering and enormous windows span the rear of the mansion.
Looking through the glass, Sam sees a giant vaulted ceiling.
Sweeping arches. An enormous and ornate music hall.

In the center of the room is a grand piano. Behind it, sits a
very old and ugly white man. He is the SONGWRITER.

The songwriter tilts his head, seeing Sam in the bushes. He
waves the young man inside.

Sam hesitates, but the Songwriter continues to wave him
closer.

Sam steps out of the grass onto the marble patio near the
sparkling blue pool.

He opens the glass doors, and pokes his head into the grand
hall.

SONGWRITER
Come inside.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS 102

Keeping his distance, Sam stands near the doorway looking
across the room at the old man on the piano bench.

The Songwriter has wild grey hair. His skin is cracked and
brittle. Old beyond belief.

The hall is filled with mirrors, gold and vintage music art -
like some warped version of Versailles.

An oversized poster of a vintage 50's album hangs above the
piano: "Julie is her Name".

SAM
You wrote "Turning Teeth" for Jesus
and the Brides of Dracula. I know it

was you.
SONGWRITER
Uh huh.
SAM
And the code in the music. I found the
tunnels... and the bomb shelter
SONGWRITER
Ok.
SAM

What does it all mean?

The Songwriter beckons Sam closer. Directing him to a small
stool facing the piano.

SONGWRITER
Come and sit down. Here.

Sam steps closer, looking at the musical instruments lining
the walls and floor. Guitars, a harpsichord, violins
ukuleles, etcetera.

Sam notices a Sonic Blue Fender Mustang guitar propped on a
floor stand. He points to it, staring in awe.

SAM
Is that Kurt Cobain's Fender Mustang
guitar?

SONGWRITER
Oh I'm not sure. Probably. I don't
remember. I have so many things.

SAM
Can I pick it up?

The Songwriter doesn't care. He shrugs his shoulders. Sure.
Sam carefully lifts the guitar and sits with it on the stool.

Running his hand along the finish, Sam mumbles and takes note
of the guitar's neck and bridge. He strums a G chord and looks
up at the old man behind the giant and ornate grand piano.

SONGWRITER
I don't always worry what the message
is. I just pass it along... I slip it
between the notes... and hide it away
for the people who know it's there.

SAM
You've done this before? The codes?

The Songwriter laughs. He starts to play "Stairway to Heaven"
but transitions into "Macarena"

SONGWRITER
I wrote most of the music your dad
grew up on, half of what you sang
along to as a kid, and I'm still doin'
it. These teenagers are dancing to
myyyy music.

Sam sees clear tubes running into the old man's nostrils -
connected to a silver canister marked with Japanese letters.

SAM
You're telling me that there are
messages hidden in old pop songs?

SONGWRITER
Movies and television shows...
everything you know.

SAM
Why?

The songwriter ignores Sam. Humming along to a few random
chords. Is that the theme song to "The Facts of Life"?

SONGWRITER
Pop culture. Ugh. It floats away like
tissue paper. I blow my nose.

SONGWRITER (cont'd)
I find an old Kleenex, I recycle it.
It becomes your wedding song.

The old man taps a few notes from "I Want to Know What Love
Is".

SAM
What are the tunnels for? Is there
gonna be a war?

The Songwriter looks away, playing "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" across
the piano keys.

SONGWRITER
I don't know. I'm just trying to make
a living. Earn a few dollars.

Sam looks around at the luxurious space.

SAM
But you have everything.

The Songwriter is quiet for a moment. He looks out at the
trees against the hillside.

SONGWRITER
No.

Sam pulls out the photo of Sarah. He holds it up for the
Songwriter to see.

SAM
Did you know this girl?

The old man leans forward and looks at the picture. He shakes
his head.

SONGWRITER
She's pretty.

SAM
She was killed along with Jefferson
Sevence. But I think you knew that.

SONGWRITER
I didn't.

The Songwriter slams his hands down forming a low and
resonating chord - letting it ring out. He plays another
chord, slowly beginning to sing something resembling a funeral
dirge.

SONGWRITER

Mulattoooo. Albinoooo. Mosquitoooo.

Sam stares at the man in horror. He glances down at the
priceless guitar in his own hands.

SONGWRITER
I don't care what's fashionable or
cool. It's all silly and meaningless.
I've created so many of the things

that you care about... the songs that
give your life purpose and joy. When
you were fifteen and rebelling... you

did that to my music.
The Songwriter holds up his fingers and moves them like spider
legs - simultaneously playing the notes to Nirvana's "Smells
Like Teen Spirit" with his other hand.

Plink plink. Plink Plink plink

SONGWRITER
It wasn't written on a distorted
guitar... I wrote it... ona
piano...here... in between a blowjob
and an omelette. There's no rebellion.
There's only me... earning a paycheck.
SAM

I don't believe you.

SONGWRITER
Good. The real message was never
intended for you. It's better if you
just smile and dance. Enjoy the
melody.

The man plays more music, pointing to his chest.

SONGWRITER
This ugly old man, me, I'm the voice
of your generation, your
grandparent's, your parent's and the
young people who follow you.

Sam stares in horror. He doesn't want to believe.

SONGWRITER
It's funny... all the things you hope
for, and dreeeeam about being a part
of... they're all a fabrication.

SONGWRITER (cont'd)

Your art, your writing, your culture
is the shell of other men's ambitions.
Ambitions beyond what you will ever
understand.

SAM
That's funny to you?

SONGWRITER
A little.

The old man coughs and wheezes - dancing his fingers merrily
across the keyboard - performing a quick mad mixture of Bach
Jesus and the Brides, Buddy Holly, N.W.A. and The Rolling
Stones.
SONGWRITER
I wrote this... and this... that...
and this too...

SAM
Stop it.

The Songwriter laughs. His cackling along with the plinking
keys of the grand piano echoes through the gigantic hall.

SAM
Who paid you to write these songs?

The Songwriter smiles and nods as he reaches into his pocket.
He lifts up a small HANDGUN, aiming it at Sam's head.

BANG!

The bullet misses Sam as he tumbles sideways to the
floor.Cobain's guitar falling on his lap.

With a single hand, the Songwriter begins to play "What's the
Frequency Kenneth". He laughs and hums the melody.

BANG!
Sam dodges a second shot, ducking down below the piano.

SAM
What are the tunnels for?!

BANG! Another bullet flies by his head. The music still plays.

SAM
Tell me what happened to Sarah!

Sam charges the old man, raising the guitar over his head like
an axe. We hear the roar of guitar feedback. Warped notes.

BANG!

The bullet zips past Sam's ear as he swings the faded
turquoise guitar down onto the Songwriter's head.

SMASH !

Bone cracks under the weight of maple and basswood. The
songwriter's skull crumbles. Brain matter lands on the ivory
keys. Distortion rumbles.

Sam swings it again, breaking the neck of the guitar from the
body... wire strings messily join the two pieces. The wooden

base hangs down like some holy instrument destroyed before a

crowd by Townshend, Hendrix or Cobain.

Sam stands over the old man. He drops the broken guitar,
breathing deeply.

The music room is quiet.

Frightened, Sam picks up the gun from the floor and stuffs it
into his jeans. He runs out the back door, leaving the room
empty and still.

The Songwriter lays motionless near the piano.
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK 103

Sam leans out his patio door, drinking a beer - visibly
shaken. The wind blows through his hair.

A dark pink sky is visible over the rooftops.

Rain clouds approach. Lightning snaps across the horizon,
followed by the low rumble of thunder

The neighbor's bird CAWS loudly.

On the television, an old movie plays. It's the 1956 version
of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Kevin McCarthy runs
across the I-5 overpass screaming. Cars cruise along, ignoring
his crazed warning.

KEVIN MCCARTHY

The gas lamps that line the garden walkway offer dim pools of
orange light. Sam walks slowly through the apartment complex's
twisting paths.

The trickle of running water through the stream follows his
footsteps.

Sam sips an iced latte, carrying an LA Weekly under his arm.
Jesus and the Brides of Dracula pose on the cover. The
partially obscured headline reads:

JESUS PREDICTS... BAD TIMES AHEAD
A DIRTY HUMAN FACE peers out from within a bush - disturbingly
low to the ground like a cat or possum. Eyes watch Sam as he
passes - he doesn't notice.
Leaves and branches rattle above.

A squirrel falls from the tree in front of Sam. It hits the
concrete, and partially splatters on the ground.

The squirrel tries to move but it's mortally injured. Sam
stares in horror at the small animal.

Is it trying to say something?

Sam backs away from it and rushes down the path. He turns a
corner.

Before him stands a shadowy figure in the center of the garden
walkway.

Stepping closer, Sam sees more clearly.

It is a two-dimensional black cardboard figure of a man
stabbing a cardboard dog. Sam approaches the cut-out stand and
tips it over with his finger

It lands on the ground with a soft tap - like a leaf coming to
rest on the forest floor.

Glass shatters!
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 105

Sam lifts his head from the damp pillow. Rain pours against
the bedroom window. Thunder rumbles - long and steady.

A cascade of lightning illuminates the messy bedroom - the
Playboys on the floor. Issue July 1970.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 106

Sam steps into the living room with pistol in hand. He sees a
hole in the glass of the sliding door... it's now half open.

The storm breeze moves across the blinds, blowing his
paperwork across the carpet. The pages of "Code Breakers" and
"Spider Man" flip wildly.

He moves closer to the patio. A careful step. Then another.
Behind Sam, a small cabinet door opens quietly. Long bare legs
fold out from within - like the appendages of an insect - bare
flesh stretches.

Now fully emerged from the tight space, the OWL'S KISS stands
behind Sam with a kitchen knife in her hand.

Sam turns and sees the naked woman in her owl-skin mask. He

jumps back as she silently sprints down the hall into his

bedroom. The door closes.

Sam stares in shock at the closed bedroom door.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 107
Sam enters the room carefully, peeking inside with the gun.

He turns on the bedroom light. She's not here.

Sam checks under the bed... in the closet... nothing.

Lightning flashes. A coyote HOWLS in the distance.

Tense. Sam opens his dresser drawer. The gun angled down
toward his socks and underwear

Knock! Knock! Knock!

Sam turns toward the sound...

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 108

Sam looks through the peep hole and sees a Los Angeles Sheriff

He holds his dizzy head as the air leaves his lungs in exodus.

whatever happens. His shoulders slump.

In the hallway, alongside the SHERIFF, stands the greasy
haired apartment Manager. His face is puckered and sour

SAM
Hello.

SHERIFF
Hi, I'm here to inform you that you
have to evacuate the premises
immediately.

SAM
Oh... This is about my rent?

Sam seems relieved for a moment. It could be worse.

SHERIFF
Yes. You haven't paid. It's...

MANAGER
Criminally overdue.

Sam takes a step closer to the Sheriff.

SAM
Is there any way I could have a couple
more days?

SHERIFF
No. I don't think so.

SAM
Please. I don't have anywhere to go.
I'm close to getting the money. I
promise I am.

SHERIFF
Listen... I don't like this either
Worst part of my job, ok?

greedy.
The Manager nods his head as the Sheriff looks back at Sam.

SHERIFF

He holds up two fingers in front of his nose.

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT BALCONY - NIGHT 109
The rain has stopped. Water drips from the eaves.

Sam smokes on the patio listening to the parrot caw.

A garbage can falls over.

RATTLE CLANG!

Sam looks down toward the pool and sees a small COYOTE digging
through the trash. It stares up at him.

The animal turns and walks down the sidewalk. Sam watches -
intensely.

EXT. SILVERLAKE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 110

Wearing his white undershirt and pajama pants, Sam follows the
coyote down the street.

The coyote glances back at him, then scampers along.
Down Griffith Park Boulevard...

Past apartments and condos...

Into the hillside neighborhood...

Expensive homes... Beautiful cars...

Things you can't possess...

at the world around him. Voices and laughter within the homes.
Families together in front of giant televisions.

EXT. SILVERLAKE HOME - NIGHT 111

The coyote runs up the DRIVEWAY of a LARGE SILVERLAKE HOME. It
disappears into the trees.

Sam stands in front of the house and looks through the front
window. People are everywhere. A big party is taking place.
Music pours from inside.

Sam notices a familiar face in profile through the picture
window.

It is Millicent Sevence.
She disappears into the crowd.
INT. LARGE SILVERLAKE HOME - NIGHT 112

Sam walks through the party in his damp white undershirt. He
scans the crowd for Millicent.

He passes a myriad of conversations. We hear only pieces of
them.

Sam moves deeper, bumping shoulders as he cranes his neck -
trying to look above it all.

FACELESS PARTY GOER
It's such a cliche! Being special
isn't special anymore. It's just so
obvious. The real trick is to find a
way to be unimportant but still get
noticed.

Sam passes through the swarming patches of conversation and
networking. A COMPLIMENTING WOMAN notices Sam's shirt as she
walks by.

COMPLIMENTING WOMAN
Oh I like your shirt.

Sam looks down at his lightly stained, old, Hanes sleep shirt.
He tugs at the cotton.

Moving deeper, Sam walks by the PARTY HOST. She's engaged in

conversation with a pretty woman. Sam recognizes her... it's
Chesty Woman... the girl he spied via the drone's video feed.

The aspiring travelers laugh together. Sam turns and spins,
looking for Millicent.

Nearby, GOSSIPING MAN engages in conversation with GOSSIPING
WOMAN.

GOSSIPING MAN
(pointing at girl)
That girl is the youngest woman to
ever write, produce, direct and sound
design her own network sitcom.

Gossiping Man casually points to a twelve-year-old girl eating
cake, surrounded by young adults and two security men in
suits. She's the ADOLESCENT PRODIGY.

GOSSIPING WOMAN
How old is she?

GOSSIPING MAN
Twelve, but she's clearly an old soul.

The Gossiping Woman nods her head, glancing back at the
Adolescent Prodigy as the young girl giggles and rudely stuffs
her finger in her nose.

GOSSIPING MAN
Honestly... she's really captured the
zeitgeist. I don't think any adult
could ever express the kind of deep
understanding that she has over her
material.

GOSSIPING WOMAN
I'm embarrassed I haven't seen it yet.

GOSSIPING MAN
You should be.

A beautiful Indian woman bumps into Sam. He turns and looks
into her eyes. It's the girl from the Contact Lens Billboard.

She looks back at Sam - holding hands with a very HANDSOME MAN
in a tailored suit. Her name, for the sake of this story, is
EX.

EX
Um. Hey. How are you?

SAM
I'm good.
EX
I'm really glad to hear that.

The beautiful woman offers Sam an honest and heartfelt look
He's silenced by her sincerity.

EX
Uh... this is my fiance.

Sam looks over, fumbles, then shakes hands with the Handsome
Man.

SAM
Oh. Hello. Congratulations.

HANDSOME MAN
Thank you.

Ex nervously twirls her finger through her hair

EX
Yes, thank you.

Sam nods and smiles, waiting for it to end.

EX

So... how's... work?
SAM

Oh. It's ok.

His face doesn't sell the lie. The beautiful woman plays along

Yup. Same here.

Handsome Man squeezes her hand gently. Ex glances over, then
steps towards Sam to offer a quick goodbye hug.

EX
Well... it was great seeing you.

SAM
Yeah. Yeah. You too.

Sam watches Ex walk away with Handsome Man.

In the distance, he sees Millicent stepping into a nearby
room.

INT. SILVERLAKE HOUSE ART ROOM - NIGHT 113

Millicent stands before a beautiful flower painting. She
focuses on it.

Sam steps alongside her and admires the petunia painting in
tandem.

MILLICENT
It's beautiful, right?

There's a sadness about Millicent that Sam suddenly
recognizes. A soft tone guides their encounter.

SAM
I was friends with one of the girls
that was with your dad. She was a nice
person.

MILLICENT
Oh.

SAM
I've been trying to find out what
happened to her.

MILLICENT

MILLICENT

Do you know anything?
114 EXT. SILVERLAKE RESERVOIR - NIGHT 114
The WATER within the RESERVOIR is calm, reflecting the moon's
glow. A few ducks quack and drift along as herons fly
overhead.

Sam and Millicent walk together along the outer fence that
surrounds the giant water reserve.

MILLICENT
What do you think it all means?

I don't know. I can't see it yet. But
I'm close... I think.

They step together in unison over the remaining puddles from
the evening rain storm.

Near the fence, Sam and Millicent pass a DOG MEMORIAL complete
with a BRONZE DOG STATUE and a plaque.

Photos of deceased dogs and puppies are taped to the fence.
Victims of the Dog Killer

Flowers cover the ground around it.
Paper signs with handwritten messages surround the photos:
We miss you Fluffy
Benny was the best dog a man ever had
Mr. Spot R.I.P.
God will judge you, dog killer!

Sam and the young woman slow down before the odd little
memorial. Millicent reacts with pain at the discovery of each
dog's expression. Pictures of the dead.

MILLICENT
I don't know if we should be walking
around here at night.

SAM
I think we're safe. We don't have a
dog with us.

MILLICENT
Yeah, but anybody who could kill a dog
wouldn't think twice about killing a
person.

SAM
I'm not sure that's true.

They walk a bit further. Sam reaches over and takes
Millicent's hand in his own.

MILLICENT
Are you a dog or a cat person?

SAM
Eh... It's hard to say. I got bit by
my grandparents' terrier when I was a
kid. I guess they kinda scare me a
little bit.

MILLICENT
That's terrible. I like dogs... but
cats are good too.

SAM
Yeah.

They walk further, looking out at the water across the
reservoir. Moonlight and stars reflect against the mirrored
surface of the man-made lake.

Sam look at Millicent's gentle and beautiful face. She looks
back at him with a nearly imperceptible grin. They share a
moment of connection. Unspoken, and stronger for it.

Two small figures under a dark sky - rounding the giant lake.

Up ahead, a LONG HAIRED WINO sits against the fence. As Sam
and Millicent approach, he leans forward and shouts.

LONG HAIRED WINO
Haaahh! !

Sam glares at the man, moving Millicent to the outer edge of
the sidewalk. Street chivalry.

LONG HAIRED WINO
Got a little change?

Sam looks down. Irritated by the question. Disgusted by the
man.

SAM
(resentful)
Nope. Sorry.

Sam avoids the man's feet, extended onto the walkway - an
intentional obstacle.

LONG HAIRED WINO
No money to spare, huh? Does the lady
know you're cheap?

SAM
Fuck you.

LONG HAIRED WINO
Ugly ass piece of shit worthless trash
motherfucker. You're more broke than I

Long Haired Wino continues to curse in the distance. Shouting
like an animal.

SAM

I know it's not ok to say this, but I
really fucking hate the homeless.
Everyone says they need our help but I
think they're bullies. They're like...
poltergeists.

MILLICENT
You mean ghosts?

SAM
Yeah... all they do is float around on
the periphery... watching people eat
tasty food, drink beer and be in
love... and they can't participate...
so they get jealous and harass us.

Millicent raises her brow.
MILLICENT
Maybe just give 'em a dollar next
time?

Sam takes a breath and looks back - still angry about the
encounter.

Millicent says nothing, smiling in response to Sam's
overreaction. She looks towards the reservoir

MILLICENT
Have you ever been in there?

Millicent points to the serene water beyond the fence.

SAM
In the reservoir?
MILLICENT
Yeah.

Eh eh.

Millicent starts to climb the fence. Designer shoes scuffed
through the chain links. Delicate hands pulling her higher.

Now in the water, the pair swim toward the center of the
reservoir. Quietly. Knowing glances between them. Naked bodies
just below the surface.

House lights are visible against the hillside landscape around
them. A dark sea in the backyards of people's homes.

This is sacred territory and they both feel it.

Treading water in the middle of the reservoir, Sam and
Millicent face each other - occasionally looking up and over
at the dark hills which cup them like hands holding bath
water.

The night sky, the stars and the moon settle along the surface
of the lake.

Millicent moves in. Closer to Sam. She nuzzles her cheek
against his neck. Hands touching skin under the water.

She kisses his ear. Whispering very close and quiet...

MILLICENT
(whispering)
I think someone is following me.

SAM
(whispering)
Are you kidding?

MILLICENT
(whispering)
I wanted it to look like we're here to
screw.

SAM

(whispering)
We're not?

MILLICENT
(whsipering)
I found something hidden in my dad's
office.

Under the water, Millicent pulls a silver bracelet off her
wrist and slips it onto Sam's arm.

He raises his forearm along the surface of the water and
stares at the circular band. It looks like Sarah's bracelet -
inscriptions of small letters and numbers etched within the
silver.
NPM 1 35 to 37 - C3 to E6
Sam focuses on the inscription.
SAM
C3 to E6. Sounds like a chess move.
Did your dad play chess?

MILLICENT
He did.

Pop!

Water splashes in front of them. A bullet hitting the water. A
silenced shot from the dark shore.

SAM
What the...

Tiny splashes appear along the surface of the lake over
Millicent's shoulder. Quiet gunfire.

Pop! Pop!

SAM
Get under the water.

Sam takes a giant breath and dives down beneath the surface.
He pulls on Millicent's arm, but they're separated in the
chaos.

Deeper he goes.

Bubbles and swirling liquid blur Sam's vision. He swims under
the water as bullets spread around him - diving like penguins.

Sam sees her...
Dropping...
Through the blue water...

Millicent sinks down past Sam - on her back - blood streaming
up from a small hole in her naked chest. Bubbles pour from her
red lips. She appears to stare at us, but it's hard to say.

Her hands cover her breasts, unknowingly mirroring Sam's most
treasured Playboy cover. July 1970.

A beautiful woman. His earliest fantasy. Dropping into the
depths of the reservoir

Sam is overwhelmed by the terrible sight.

Water pours off his body as he climbs up the concrete
embankment along the edge of the lake.

Naked and frantic, Sam reaches the fence and climbs.

EXT. RANCHO LOS FELIZ APARTMENTS - NIGHT 116
Sam walks quickly down the garden path - still naked and wet.
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - MORNING 117

Sam wakes up. Naked on his living room carpet. The silver
bracelet around his wrist.

He stares at the inscription around the band, twisting it with
his hand. The sun is bright through the open patio door.

SAM
C3 to E6. C3 to E6?

The neighbor's parrot CAWS from across the way.

PARROT

Sam stares at the bracelet.

SAM
(under his breath)
What the fuck are you saying?
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY 118

Sam opens an old Milton Bradley chess box. He flips the board
out and grabs his black Sharpie marker

SAM

Sam circles the square C3 on the chess board - drawing an
arrow towards E6 across the checkered boxes.

does it means?

SAM
Hm.

Sam looks back at the bracelet.
SAM
NPM 1 35 to 37. NPM. NPM. What the
fuck is NPM?

Sam sits with his laptop, typing the letters NPM into Google
Search.

He scans the resulting page... nothing makes sense.

SAM
N. P.M.

Sam runs his hands through his messy hair in frustration. He
looks across the carpet and sees the old Nintendo
Entertainment System.

An idea sparks.

Reaching across the floor, Sam grabs a stack of Nintendo Power
Magazines.

He sorts through the covers, finding the first issue. Mario
smiles, leaping from a mushroom - a carrot in his hand.

SAM
NPM issue number one. Fuck.

The pages fly past us like a piece of animation, flipped
across Sam's thumb.

He settles on pages 35, 36 and 37.

It's a subdivided map from "The Legend of Zelda". Sam smiles
as he notices the alphanumeric grids that cover the map. He
circles the squares corresponding to C3 and E6.

SAM
What the fuck do I do with this?

Outside, the parrot CACKLES. Children splash in the pool.

Sam looks across the room and notices the Moonstones cereal
box sitting on the counter. He runs to it.

Tearing it open, he tastes one of the cereal bites. Repulsed
by the ancient stale food, he spits it onto the floor as he
digs deeper into the box with a single hand.

From the bottom, he pulls out a prize. A plastic-wrapped
transparency-map of Los Angeles covered with Moonstone
characters and bright colors.

He opens the wrapper and pulls out the map...

Holding the cartoon map of LA over the Zelda map, Sam realizes
that they line up perfectly.

E6 corresponds to the Silverlake reservoir

SAM
So that's the reservoir. And...

C3 is a wooded section of Mt. Hollywood.

SAM
Mt. Hollywood?

Sam opens google maps and brings up the Los Angeles overhead
map. He zooms in. Tighter and tighter on the rear section of
Mt. Hollywood.

A small square of forest is BLACKED OUT. A solid graphic
marked with text:

Satellite Image Unavailable

Sam stares at the small hidden square. He hits his hand down
against the couch.

SAM
What the fuck is in there?

EXT. LOS ANGELES RIVER TRAIL - DAY 119
Sam races up the path along the LA river on an old BMX bike.

He's wearing a red hoodie over his head, looking like a man-

child from a Steven Spielberg movie.

He stands on the pedals and lifts his head into the wind -
looking toward the tall green hills beyond the river

He pedals faster. A man on a bicycle heading toward adventure.

EXT. MOUNT HOLLYWOOD FOREST - DAY 121

Sam reaches the tall wooden fence. He notices several painted
marks along the wall.

///

Three parallel lines - diagonal from the top to the bottom of
the wall.

What does that mean?

Sam opens his wallet and pulls out a piece of scrap paper
filled with handwritten translations of Hobo Code.

It's the paper "key" created by Comic Man.

Sam runs his finger over the symbols, stopping alongside the
three parallel lines. The hobo translations is:

this is not a safe place
EXT. MOUNT HOLLYWOOD FOREST - DAY 122

Reaching a clearing, Sam steps through the trees and looks
ahead.

He sees a single straw hut in the middle of an overgrown
field.

A few Alberto Giacometti human-figure sculptures stand like
scarecrows within the grass. An eerie expression of the
emaciated human form. Tall or short... all with appendages
like twigs.

Sam walks toward the straw hut, checking the gun tucked into
his waist band.

He hears water splashing from inside. Delicately.

INT. STRAW HUT - DAY 123
Arriving at the doorway of the hut, Sam looks inside. He see a
fifty-nine-year-old man in a white gown, crouched on the

floor.

This man, the FINAL MAN, is washing the feet of three young

women in white rags. Sam recognizes their faces as they look
up from their seated positions along the wood floor.

(CONTINUED)
131.
123 CONTINUED: 123

It's Troy, Fannie, and Mae. The girls in the White Rabbit.

SAM
Hello?

The Final Man turns and faces Sam. He remains sitting Indian-
style in the center of the straw hut. The three beautiful
young women sitting in a row along the wall.

FINAL MAN
Hello.

Silence. Sam waits for something to happen.

FINAL MAN
Can I help you?

SAM
Um... yeah.

The girls cock their inquisitive heads as Sam clears his
throat.

SAM
My friend Sarah was killed. These
girls know something about it.

FINAL MAN
Why do you assume that?
SAM
I saw her taking things from Sarah's

apartment.
Sam points at Troy. She smiles as his finger singles her out.
SAM
I found a code in their friend's song.
I've been in the tunnels.

FINAL MAN
Alright.

The Final Man calmly pours several cups of tea into tiny
porcelain containers. He passes them out to the girls - taking
one for himself.

FINAL MAN
Please sit down. Drink with us.

Sam sits against the wall, staring at the man and his triad
harem.

(CONTINUED)
132.

123 CONTINUED: (2) 123

SAM
I found a bunker down there. Some kind
of shelter in case of a nuclear war.

TROY
It's not a shelter.

SAM
What is it then?

The Final Man places a small cup of tea on the floor in front
of Sam.

FINAL MAN
A tomb.

SAM
What?

Mae's face brightens with excitement. She looks to the Final
Man.

MAE
Was it ours?

The Man pats Mae on the leg - a comforting "I'll be with you
in a moment" gesture.

FINAL MAN
They're tombs. For kings... like me.
Like Jefferson Sevence.

The girls begin to drink their tea.

SAM
Why would Jefferson Sevence need a
tomb underneath the city?

The Final Man glances over at his Ascension Brides. He makes a
face to them - suggesting that Sam doesn't "get it". Troy
grins back in adoration.

SAM
A cemetery isn't good enough?

Sam glares at them all - growing more irritated with their
smug and holy demeanor.

FINAL MAN
It's not about burial. It's about
ascension. We're not dying, we're
being transported to another world.
Somewhere better than this.

As the Final

SAM
Are you talking about heaven?

FINAL MAN

You'd have to be a fool to think that
poverty in this life equals wealth in
the next. I'm talking about something
exclusive and real. Our souls will be
pulled from our bodies and carried
through the unfathomable amniotic sac
that holds us here and prevents us
from true connection.

Man describes the birth-like barrier separating
bliss, he tugs at his cheeks - the skin on his

FINAL MAN
We will be beyond this universe and
living together as kings without
limitation. The pharoahs did it...
great men throughout history have done
the same.

Sam stares at the man, trying to make sense of it.

SAM
Are you dying?

The man shakes his head, smiling at the course of Sam's
ignorant interrogation.

FINAL MAN
I'm about to be sealed inside a tomb
with my beautiful brides...

The Final Man waves his hand, presenting his future wives.

FINAL MAN
. and all my worldly treasures.
We'll have delicious meals and wine
and television and sex. Enough to last
us for six months.

SAM
And then you die?

The Final Man gulps his tea in a single shot - setting the cup
back on the tray.

FINAL MAN
No. We wait to be ascended. Our souls
and all the gold I've managed to
collect will be transported.

FINAL MAN (cont'd)
Enough to buy ourselves a position of
royalty in a world of perfection and
beauty.

Sam stares in disbelief. This is madness of course.

FINAL MAN
Only the richest of men can afford
this ceremony. I'm not even gonna tell
you how many people you have to kill
for just one man... and three women...

He glances back at his grateful brides.

FINAL MAN

. to reach the afterlife. The
requirements for sacrifice are so
specific... hair color, age, sex,
tooth alignment, dietary habits,
cancer formations... it takes a
fortune and and an army to catalog
these people and kill them according
to ritual.

SAM
Who did you kill?

FINAL MAN
It's expensive to build a tunnel
system and keep it hidden, but it
costs even more to murder people and
not be harassed about it. The
infrastructure, the management, the
bribery... all in the name of
something holy and pure.

SAM
Did you kill Sarah?

The Final Man pulls a bamboo framed photo off the wall near
the doorway. He offers it up to Sam.

FINAL MAN
No one will find our chambers for a
thousand years. Future men will
understand that we were the modern
kings. Rulers without statues or
effigies.

Looking at the photo, Sam sees Jefferson Sevence in a white
gown - his arms around Sarah and her two roommates in white
rags. All sitting together within this very same straw shack.

Wide smiles across their faces. No fear or terror
(CONTINUED)

123 CONTINUED: (5) 123

SAM
They were here?

Looking closer, Sam notices that Sarah's "How to Marry a
Millionaire" dolls are visible on the floor behind her

SAM
Is Sarah alive?
FINAL MAN
She may have ascended already. I don't

know.

Sam points downward - growing more disgusted and horrified
with each revelation.

SAM
She's in one of those tombs?

Fannie nods her head - a big smile of anticipation across her
face.

SAM
With Sevence?
FINAL MAN
Yes.
SAM
But they found his body.
FINAL MAN
They found another man's bones mixed
with... most of Jefferson's teeth,

some of his skin, and all the organs
that he's able to live without.

Sam is taken aback - horrified by it all - a swirling sickness
in his head.

The white robed host and hostesses observe Sam as his
breathing changes - sweat forms on his skin.

FINAL MAN
(signaling quotation
marks with his hands)
Did you think "heaven" was easy?
Sam looks down at his lap. He's unable to focus.

I never gave it much thought.

I think you're gonna bury yourself

and you're gonna fucking eat each

other and die. After that... I have no
idea.

FINAL MAN
I doubt that it will be so grim, but
even if it is... it'll be worth it.

The Final man looks around the room in disgust.

FINAL MAN
All this ugliness is just a cocoon.

Sam's eyes flare with anger. He's had enough.
SMASH! !

He pounds his fist into the wall, knocking several photos and
ceremonial statues to the floor

The Final Man and his Brides are momentarily startled. They
watch Sam as he exhales deeply, regaining his composure.

MAE
(whispering to herself)
That's such an angry thing to do.

FINAL MAN
(calm)
What are you upset about?

SAM
I just... want to see Sarah.

FINAL MAN
Ok. Well... let's see if we can get
her on the phone.

Spinning around in his seat, the Final Man opens up a bamboo
panel, revealing a flat-screen monitor and corded telephone
receiver. He presses some buttons and waits - listening into
to the earpiece.

SAM
They have a phone?

FINAL MAN
Incoming calls only. We've had
problems in the past. People getting

SAM
They're trapped?

The phone continues to ring - very quietly from the receiver.
Static on the screen.

FINAL MAN

(speaking in a half-

whisper as one does

when on the phone)
We wouldn't want to lose out on
eternal life just because we might
have a normal physical aversion to
being buried underneath the earth.
We're only human.

There's a light click - a voice on the line - unheard by us.

FINAL MAN

Hello, how are you?

(beat)
Uh huh. Ok good.

(beat)
Do you mind if I put you on video
phone? A friend of yours is here. He
wants to see you.

(beat)
Ok. Great.

The Final Man presses another button and the television
flickers on, revealing a beautiful young woman's face.

It is Sarah - looking straight at us through the video screen.

She appears calm, comfortably covered in a simple summer
dress, holding the telephone up to her cheek.

Behind her is a cavernous, brightly-lit living room. Rock
formations hang from the ceiling, alongside a diamond
encrusted chandelier.

One of Sarah's roommates, the Brunette, is sitting naked on a
lazy-boy chair - her legs propped up before a giant television
screen. She's brushing her teeth - spitting into a small
golden chalice.

Jefferson Sevence is sitting on the couch, nestled up against
Sarah's blond roommate.

They're watching an old episode of The Andy Griffith Show on

TV Land - sharing a bowl of popcorn.

A mountain of gold bars lines the far wall.

The Final Man hands Sam the telephone. He holds it up to his

ear.
SARAH
Hello?
SAM
Sarah? Can you hear me?
SARAH
Yeah. Hellooo.
SAM
I've been looking for you.
SARAH
Really?
SAM
Yeah.
SARAH
You hardly know me.

Sarah stares into the televison screen - deep in thought. Her
face displays a range of feelings. Joy. Fear. Doubt.

Sarah looks back at Jefferson and her roommates - all laughing
before the giant television.

SARAH
I'm gonna take this in the bedroom.

She holds the phone out towards her Brunette Roommate.

SARAH
Will you hang it up when I get in
there?

BRUNETTE ROOMMATE
Sure.

The Brunette gets out of her chair and takes the phone as
Sarah exits our view.

The naked Brunette stands there. She half-listens into the ear
piece - bored - with her hand on her waist. A finger twists
the curly chord.

The Final Man looks over at Sam. He leans close and whispers.

FINAL MAN
(whispering to Sam)
Their chamber was covered with a
mountain of concrete. It can't be
opened. There's no point in upsetting
the girl. Please be kind.

The screen switches to a view of an ornate underground
bedroom. Sarah sits on the floor staring at the camera with
the phone to her ear.

SARAH

frustration.

SARAH
Ehhhhhhh.

She shakes off the bad feelings.
SARAH
Well there's no getting out, so I may
as well make the best of things, huh?

SAM
Yeah...

Sam looks away from the tv monitor and stares through the
doorway into the outside world.

SAM
Same here.

Sarah nods at the screen, fidgeting with her dress. Taking a
moment to herself.

SARAH
So... how are you doing?
SAM
Not great.
SARAH
Have you thought about getting another
dog?

No.

Sarah places her receiver down as the Final Man turns off the
monitor. He takes the phone away from Sam.

FINAL MAN
0k?

Sam nods. His face is pale. He picks up his cup of tea and
takes a sip.

Mae reaches out and holds hands with the other Ascension
Brides. She looks between them and the Final Man - now
ignoring Sam.

MAE
Last night... I had a vision of us
making love beneath the earth, then
swimming together naked in a dark
pool. And that's when it happens...
our bodies dissolve into light and
every beautiful thought we've ever had
forms around us and carries our souls
through space to another world... and
we're just laughing the whole time
because we know that nothing can ever
be wrong again.

Mae turns to Sam.

MAE
I wish you were coming with us.

Sam gulps the rest of his tea. He sets the cup onto the floor
The Final Man looks over at Sam.

Troy lays back against the wall and closes her eyes. Mae folds
into a little ball on the floor

FINAL MAN
What do you win? A 2 week vacation? A
new car? Maybe a little money to
retire on? It's all a shitty, sawdust
filled rabbit. The things you care
about are useless where we're going.

Sam stares ahead as the Final Man slumps over, landing on the
girls' slack bodies. His head rests on Mae's thigh.

Sam tries to stand. He touches his face and stumbles to the
side. Falling down. His head on the wooden floor. Mouth agape.

Sam watches the orange sun cross the skyline beyond the trees.
It's beautiful outside.

Through the open doorway, Sam sees a grass-covered hatch open
in the middle of the field.

The Homeless King emerges from under the ground.

Calmly, he walks to the hut and stops at the entrance, looking
down at Sam.

The Homeless King leans on the door frame, back-lit against
the LA sun, posing like a mock-John-Wayne. Waiting. Patient.

Sam tries to lift his face.

The homeless king stands before him - blocking the stone
doorway.

Sam takes a breath.
SAM
What happened to that man? And those
girls?
HOMELESS KING
They're waking up right now. In their
ascension chamber.

SAM
And so now you're gonna kill me?

HOMELESS KING
Do you know what you did wrong?

Sam opens his eyes completely, looking up at his accuser
SAM
(nervous)
No.

The Homeless King lifts up his hand, revealing a few dog
biscuits in his palm.

HOMELESS KING
We found these in your pocket.

Sam says nothing.

The Homeless King shuffles the biscuits in his hand and
considers their importance.

HOMELESS KING
Why do you have dog biscuits in your
pocket?
Sam stares at the dirty man with deep anger.

SAM
I used to like a girl who had a dog.

The Homeless King thinks about this for a moment, narrowing
his eyes. He shakes his head - a tiny grin of skepticism on
his face.

HOMELESS KING
When was that?

SAM
A long time ago.

The Homeless King considers the response - debates a reply.

HOMELESS KING
Did she stop loving you?

SAM
Uh huh.

The Homeless King stares into Sam's eyes - waiting for more.
He repeats his question like a mantra.

HOMELESS KING
Why do you have dog biscuits in your
pocket?

Sam doesn't answer. He stares back defiantly - angry -
resentful.

SAM
I was waiting for her to take me back.
I wanted to give the dog a treat and
rub its ears - like the way I used to.
And everything would be good again.

The Homeless King moves closer, looking down at his prisoner
with Christ-like eyes. He unlocks Sam's chains and steps to
the side - offering a clear path towards the doorway.

HOMELESS KING
You can go now.

SAM
Really?

HOMELESS KING
Yeah.

Sam walks to the doorway. He reaches a tall staircase.

Sam begins to climb up the very long and very narrow row of
stone steps.

Where does this staircase go?

Sam lifts a metal door. Bright light pours down into the
passageway.

EXT. LOS FELIZ BOULEVARD - LATE DAY 125

Sam emerges in the parking lot of the 76 gas station near
Hillhurst and Los Feliz.

The street is bustling. The sun peeks through the clouds.
Music zips past Sam as cars race by in both directions. Lady
Gaga. Neil Diamond. David Bowie. Cher. Jesus and the Brides of
Dracula.

Just pieces. Fragmented and warped together by the doppler
effect. All songs become one singular melody...

the majestic green hillside.

Is this what's underneath?

EXT. LOS FELIZ BOULEVARD - LATE DAY 127
Sam passes some Latino teenagers picnicking near the

Mulholland Memorial fountain. The kids are listening to music

as they eat their food.

Madonna's "Express Yourself" plays loudly from the cheap
portable speakers on their blanket...

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no, no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
You'll never come down
Sam crosses the I-5 overpass. Traffic is thick. The cars move
slowly now - bumper to bumper down Los Feliz. Sam looks at
them as he walks along.
Below him, cars idle along the I-5 freeway.

Here is the site of Kevin McCarthy's dramatic plea for help at
the conclusion of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers".

Should Sam scream a warning? Yell out to the passing cars?
He says nothing. Watching them pass. Remaining silent.
EXT. LOS FELIZ BOULEVARD - LATE DAY 128

Sam walks along the sidewalk, passing by the Contact Lens
Billboard.

Workers are switching out the signage. The contact lens ad is
being replaced with a McDonalds advertisement.

Sam' ex-girlfriend's face is cut in half - partially covered
by Ronald McDonald's grin.

The oddly divided girl looks down at Sam and the passing cars

of Los Feliz Boulevard. Her subtle expression is supplanted by
Ronald's enormous and disturbing smile.

EXT. VILLAGE BAKERY - LATE DAY 129
Sam passes by the coffee shop. He looks inside at the pretty
bakery girls. They laugh and chatter as they clean the counter

and flip chairs onto tables.

He sees them through the window's faded sharpie handwriting -
still visible across the glass.

BEWARE THE DOG KILLER
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK 130
Sam enters his apartment with a bag of groceries.

He ignores the large, spray-painted mark across his dining
room wall.

°c

Sam unloads the bag: A 2-quart container of Tropicana Original
Orange Juice and a box of Nabisco Original Premium Saltine
Crackers.

He sets the groceries on the counter alongside an opened
priority envelope.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK 131

Sam is sitting on the couch, staring at the July 1970 Playboy
cover.

In the background, the groceries remain along the counter -
though opened. Crackers spread like dominos out of their
plastic bag. A pulp covered glass of orange juice - half
drunk.

Sarah's picture rests on Sam's lap.
The gun sits neatly on the white CB2 tv tray before him.

His dusty VCR is on the carpet - cables and plugs running from
it to the back of the tv.

A shaky VHS recording plays on the television. It is "Seventh
Heaven". Janet Gaynor cries and emotes with grand perfection
and beauty.

Sam's Nintendo lies on the carpet next to the VCR. A tangled
mess of chords and old entertainment technology.

The upside down Playmate stares at Sam... from under the blue
water.

He hears the parrot cawing.
PARROT
(0.S.)
Rrrottafendnnnddddd!

Sam looks towards the window. Breathing slowly. Debating. Eyes
unblinking.

EXT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DUSK 132
Sam stands in the hallway, knocking on an apartment door

The Bird Woman opens the door, wearing a t-shirt and no bra.

She looks at Sam with a suspicious expression. The look of a
housewife greeting a door-to-door salesman.

Sam smiles to her.

INT. BIRD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 133

Sam and the Bird Woman lie naked on the living room floor -
sweaty and tired.

A throw-rug under their bodies. A couch cushion under their
heads.

The Topless Bird Woman nuzzles close to Sam. Affectionate. She
smells his chest and shoulder.

TOPLESS BIRD WOMAN
Is that patchouli?

SAM
No.

The parrot caws from outside on the woman's balcony. Sam looks
towards it - perched in its cage.

PARROT
Nawwwwwddduuumeennndd

SAM
What's the bird saying?

The Bird Woman looks back toward the patio. She shakes her
head.

BIRD WOMAN
I don't know. Honestly, I've always
wondered, but I have no idea.
Sam nods his head and stares at the bird. It shouts once more.
He takes it in.
EXT. TOPLESS BIRD WOMAN'S BALCONY - NIGHT 134

Sam stands alone on the woman's balcony. The birds are quiet
in their cages.

Gentle rustling.

Lighting a cigarette, Sam looks across the courtyard to his
own apartment - hidden in the trees and foliage.

He looks through the open window into his home.
It's quiet and still.
Finally...

Sam's front door opens, and the Apartment Manager steps into
the dimly lit living room. The Sheriff follows him inside.

Sam watches the men, from his hidden perch, as they sift
through his things, pointing at the walls and shaking their
heads.

Sam exhales smoke...

The End Credits Roll.

We hear REM's "Strange Currencies"...

SINCERE VOICE

(singing)
I don't know why you're mean to me
when I call on the telephone... and I

don't know what you mean to me, but I
want to turn you on, turn you up

figure you out... I want to take you
on... these words "you will be mine"
these words "you will be mine"... all

the time...
