2nd REVISED 9/28/66 “IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT"

FADE UP:

BLACK SCREEN - THE CPENING TITLES SUPERED OVER A SERIES OF
THE FOLLOWING SHOTS:

The air is filled with quiet, country, night sounds, shattered by the distant
blare of a diese! train, The light from the train gradually dences across
the surface of the polished rails. We now SEE the railroad tracks more
clearly, stretched out before us. As the horn blows again to signal an
approaching station, the headlight grows in intensity and flares into the
lens. As the train rolls by, the CAMERA PANS with it to reveal a
weathered sign. We read the sign in the rapid flashes of light fram the
cceach windows: You Are Now Entering The Town of Spurta, Mississippi.
Welcome.

CLOSE SHOT - COACH WHEELS

coming toa stop. Steam from the cooling system curls around the lowered
steps. CAMERA STAYS with the feet of one, lono possenger, revealing a
suitcase and legs only. CAMERA PANS feet across the deserted station
platform.

CUT TO:

WHEELS OF TRAIN

os it starts out of station, The diesel horn again shatters the stillness of
the night. As train pulls out, CAMERA PANS UP TO REVEAL empty
street. We realize the train has passed over an open street crossing.

1 INT. A DINER ~ EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - A FLY ON A CALENDAR -
NIGHT

We hear the diesel horn of the train in the b.g. The calendar is one of
those with a topping photo of a nubile nymph sunning herself ona rock.
Below, September is subdivided into squares. A transient fly travels from
September ten to the girl's navel where he steps te preen himself. SPLAT!
The killing end of a rubber band obliterates him.

2 CLOSE SHOT - A GLEEFUL RALPH HENSHAW

Marksman extraordinaire, counterboy of this shabby all-night diner,
grins at the triumph of man over fly. RALPH is nineteen. His sharp, bony
face is shadowed by teenhood acne,

ANGLE SHOT

post a police officer at the counter in immediate f.g., and toward
Ralph in the b.g. The police officer is SAM WCOD.

RALPH
Man ate the last just 'fore you come in,

Sam nods irritably. Under his armpits halfmoons of sweat testify to
the September heat. Ralph pulls back the end of the thick rubber
band with his right hand, extends his aiming loft hand which grips
the opposite end of the band toward another fly which has come to
roost on the stained wall near the coffee tub. Sam Icoks away from
the fly hunt, fixes his eye on a clouded plastic lid covering a cake
dish on the counter. A fone wedge slumps isolated beneath the lid.

SAM
Who's that tittle ole orphan in there ?

SPLAT! The fly killer glances over his shoulder at the cake plate.

RALPH
Marblecake.

Sam shakes his head, drains the last of the watery ic. from nis coke
glass, gets off the stool.

RALPH

easing forward)
You can have her free, Sam - she bein’

himself from the seat,

HIS MOVING POV - THE BLOCK OF SHACKS

Yards bare, fences collapsing, house fronts peeling, everywhere
a dark and ugly facade. Suddenly - up ahead - c patch of yellow
violates the blackness.

glides in toward the house from which the light shines. The car
stops at curbside.

He turns down the radio, eyes ncrrowing as he locks ot:

HIS POV - THE ILLUMINATED WINDOW

and inside, in the kitchen, lit by a bright bulb hanging from the
ceiling, seen through the weary unmoving curtains, her bare back-
side and shapely naked shoulders mistily revealed, is a sixteon=
year old Sam knows to be DELDRES PURDY, The girl lifts a cup
to her lips.

SAM

drops his eyes, guides the car away, dabs at his forehead, this time
with the back of his hand, not his kerchief.

on the far side.

EXT. THE TOWN ~- FOLLOWING THE TAIL LIGHTS ~ NIGHT

of the patrol car. We STAY with them until suddenly

they flare into CAMERA as Sam drives his foot against

the brakes. The patrol car stops. We hear Sam's door
opening o.s., then slamming closed. CAMERA DROPS DOWN

so that we are SHOOTING LOW and under the car and
PANNING with Sam's feet as they move around and stop -
now we see why - a figure sprawled face down, eyes open
and beseeching us, one cheek pressed against the pavement
in the manner of a man lying flat to search for a rolling
quarter under a car.

ANOTHER ANGLE ~ SAM AND THE FIGURE

Sam approaches, his hand somehow drifting toward the butt
of his holstered .38. Just above the figure, that of a
well-dressed man, Sam stops.

CLOSER ANGLE - SAM

looks away from the figure, peers around edgily.

FROM HIS ANGLE - A COMPLETE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREE
SWEEP

of the. dark buildings here in the center of town. No
light shines. Nothing moves. Sidewalks and pavement
lie bleakly.

SAM

kneels toward the man sprawled on his stomach, legs
apart, arms above his head. Sam feels inside and under
the chest for a heartbeat, finds none. He stares a
long moment at the fixed. profile, graven against the
pavement, notices the dark blotch at the back of the
head. Tentatively he reaches out, lets his fingertips
touch the matted hair. He brings his hand back and in
the faint glow of the nearest street lamp considers the
brown-red smear.

Sam hurries to the patrol car, ANGLE WIDENING,

INT. A BEDROOM - ANGLED ACROSS A MAN'S BARE FEET - NIGHT

He lies on top the bed. His eyes are wide open, fixed
in a study of the ceiling. Sweat runs off his big body.
Except for a pair of rumpled shorts he is naked. The
cheap alarm clock on the night table near his head
ticks noisily. The man is BILL GILLESPIE, new chief of
police of Wells.

The telephone rings. He reaches for it swiftly. None
of this leisured stuff for Bill Gillespie. Ring -
grab.

GILLESPIE
(into the phone)
Yes?

VOICE
Hate to wake you, Chief.

GILLESPIE
What is it, Courtney?

The accent is not native to the area, for Gillespie is
a Texan, and there is a marked difference in the
Southern intonation of Gillespie's voice and those or
the night deskman and of Sam Wood.

VOICE
(almost happily)
Got ourselves a killin'.

where he is 'till I get there.
Got all that?

VOICE
Sure have, Chief.

Gillespie hands up, starts for the bathroom, stops
half-way, remembers something, comes back to the phone
with a sense of annoyance. He picks up the instrument,

dials.

VOICE
Police Department - hold on -
got another call goin' here.

Hello... hello!

But there is no answer. Gillespie sighs, waits. Then he
gits on the bed, tries to keep the phone between shoulder

_and ear as he pulls on his stockings. He's got both

stockings on and is lacing one shoe before:

VOICE
Police Department.

GILLESPIE

CHARLIE

Least he isn't moving on me.

ANGLE CONTINUES TO WIDEN so that we see now we're at the
scene of the crime with Gillespie. His police car is
angled in toward the curb. An ambulance is parked near
the sprawled figure on the pavement, two attendants
standing by as DOCTOR STUART searches the corpse in vain
for a life-pulse. Sam Wood stands alongside Gillespie
and mops his sweaty forehead.

GILLESPIE
(to Charlie)
From every angle. Clear?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir!

right hand probing back toward the butt of his gun as he
hops onto the wooden platform and inoves mota-like toward
a single dusty bulb lighting the area. Insects collide

The man is a Negro, in his late twenties, Sam judges, but
herets a strange thing - this Negro is well-dressed,

despite the heat, with a shirt and tie, although he has
taken off his suit coat and folded it neatly alongside him,
His nose seems the nose of an aristocratic white man, the
line of his mouth slender and well-formed, The eyes are
even more remarkable, Something dances behind them - a kind
of banked fire.

SAM
I mean NOW!

The Negro reaches for his coat, Sam knocks his arm aside
and spins him around, clamps a sweaty forearm under his
chin, In this control-position, Sam searches the Negro,
Finding no weapon, Sam releases the throat-hold, steps
vack, hand firmly on his gun butt now, ready for the draw,

the search position with dedication, Sam pats him down,
extracts a wallet, Sam hefts it.

The Negro nods, but maintains his incline on the wall.

deesn't look up as Sam brings in his prisoner. Gillespie
is pretending to make notes on a pad. The Chief's office
has scarred walls flaking off their ten thousandth coat of
paint, an ancient desk, one leg shorter than the others,
but compensated for by the insertion of the Wells telephone
directory under it. Behind Gillespie's desk is a calendar
on which the elapsed days of August have been precisely

Gillespie stares at the tall Negro, Then he smiles, Then
ne chuckles a little, Then he laughs out loud, His
laughter brings Sam Wood catapulting into the room, This
time, however, Gillespie does not banish him, There's
something about his prisoner that makes Gillespie feel he'd
better keep a witness on hand, Tibbs reaches into his
breast pocket, brings out a small lapel wallet,

Cross the compleiat desk and switchboard area. George is
trying to raise long distence as Sam motions Tibbs past a
worn wooden bench for waiting complainants and through a
waist-high swinging gate with a broken latch, thence into
a larger room slocked off by four desks, The floor is
tobacco-stained, the wastebaskets are unemptied, a ceiling
lamp hangs over each desk, three of the lamps with dusty
globes, the fourth, on which the globe is »roken, shaded by

The young cameraman, Charlie, literally bursts into the
reception foyer from outside, He clutches a sheath of 4x5
photos in one hot hand, The abruptness of his arrival
spins Sam around in his chair, makes Tibbs glance up,

HOLD both men in SECT,

GILLESP Ig
Your Chief's on the line, He
wants to talk to you,

Tibbs moves to Gillespie's office, Cillespie coming along
watchfully.

55 INT, GILLESPIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Tibbs crosses to the telephone, Gillespie has stopped in
the doorway.

TIEBS
I'm sorry to have involved you
in this, sir, but - I didn't
have much choice,

 

He listens and suddenly his eyes widen, Dismay begins to
show on his face, He looks over at Gillespie.

TIBBS

You can't be - serious?

(but the voice on

the phone is

insistent)
But - but, look... you don't have
the - the complete picture, Even
if I could be of some help, they
wouldn't want it, Wo, Itm not
prejudiced, Yes, of course, I'm
a@ police officer, Yes, sir, they're
police officers,..

Apparently, the decision at the other end is final, Tibbs
holds out the telephone, His eyes are hard, almost un-
pleasant.

Flushed with the pleasure of being sarcastic with so important
an officer as the Chief of Police of Philadelphia, Gillespie
hangs up the telephone,

He and Tibbs measure each other,

‘ GILLIS? I

There is challenge in the look - and insuly - and something
else too (Gillespie's secret knowledge that he personally
hasn't the least damn idea how to go about examining a
corpse).

Gillespie lets the challenge float there for a second,
then he continues out.

Tibbs seems to be fighting some kind of inner war with
himself, but he goes out after Gillespie.

properly funereal. He holds out a welcoming hand to

radar sweep.

Gillespie ignores the hand.

Got him downstairs.

But Ulam, eyes fixed on Tibbs, remains unmoving.

INT. A ROOM - FULL SHOT ~ NIGHT

Doc Stuart is covering with a sheet the still-clothed body
on a single slab in room center. The room is outfitted
with large stainless steel tubs, shelves and cabinets.

Gillespie crosses directly to the body. He almost appears
to have some idea what he is supposed to be doing, but the
pretense collapses when he lifts the top edge of the sheet,
stares down with obvious annoyance and bafflement et the
mystery of this untimely death.

pafflement and inexperience.

Tibbs approaches the slab, Gillespie sees how Ulam and the
doctor stare at the Negro, It suits his mood to let it
pother them, not to explain Tibbs to them, just as nobody
had explained Tibbs to him and caught him in this god-damned
embarrassing position in the first place,

CLOSER ANGLE - TIBBS AND THE DEAD MAN

Tipbs doesn't merely lift a corner of the sheet (as you've
geen it done all these years in movies), He folds the sheet
back all the way, holds it out behind him, expecting someone
to take it from him - as they do in Philadelphia at the
police morgue.

But nobody moves, Tibbs looks around, sees the hard face of
Ulam and the interested face of the doctor, Tibbs places
the sheet on the floor, turns back to the dead man,

CLOSE ON TIBBS

looking down with a kind of curious tenderness,

ANGLED ON THE THREE WHITE MEN

watching Tibbs raise one of the dead man's hands, examine
first the palms, then the fingernails, Tibbs looks pleased,

TIBBS

That's very good,

The others react, Tibbs replaces the hand, moves up to peer
at the massive head wound,

TIBBS
(thoughtfully)

sock and examines the foot and ankic,

celluloid scale, a thermometer,

Who is this boy anyway?

GILLESPIE

Impressed, the doctor begins to nod,

know, sir, the loss of heat from
the brain is the most reliable
index to the elapsed time since
terminal death,

Tibbs considers the doctor and Ulam.

TIBBS
Which of you gentlemen will assist
me?

Nobody moves, but the jangling of the telephone at that
moment breaks the spell of the white men's astonishment in
the face of such professionalism from a colored man, Ulam
picks up the phone,

EXT, AN ALMOST ENDLESS PASTURE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - DUSK

This is a stylized SHOT to bridge the previous scene and
this moment, serving actually in place of a DISSOLVE. The
SHOT should be made from a helicopter, starting high, and
MOVING IN ~ but printed in SLOW MOTION ~- until we are
MEDIUM CLOSE on the subject which, from the air, we saw
merely as a speck at the far edge of the pasture, but which
we now discover is Virgil Tibbs.

Tibbs is bent over, almost delicately, one hand outstretcned
toward an object on the ground as we resume NORMAL FILM
SPEED. Tibbs picks up the object with a handkerchief, then
slowly rises. We see that he 1s gripping a two~foot long,
two-inch thick pine sapling. He considers one end of the
club-like branch with narrowing eyes, sees the dried stain
discoloring the wood. Then without moving the position of
his feet he looks around at the grass in the immediate area.
Suddenly he hears the SOUND of someone approaching through

nearby brush. He grips the sapling more firmly, looks toward
the brush, reacts to the sight of:
