EXT. - MOUNTAIN ROAD -NIGHT

A police patrol car winds down a mountain road in to a small
town.

EXT. MAIN STREET TOWN - CONTINUOUS

The patrol car rolls slowly down the street. The town is a
mess. Broken and looted windows, litter everywhere.
Hundreds of Diamond Dead flyers blow in the wind.

INT. PATROL CAR - CONTINUOUS

SHERIFF STUTSMAN tall, blocky-built, mid forties is trying to
raise somebody on the radio, but all he gets is static. The
engine dies and the radio crackles sharply then goes silent
as well.

SHERIFF
Stutsman to despatch... Edna! Pick
up the radio... What the hell...

STUTSMAN unlocks his shot gun and exits the vehicle as it
rolls to a stop in front of the VFW Legion Hall.

EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

The street is deserted. Flyers plastered on the hall door
read: "ONE NIGHT ONLY DR. DIABOLICUS AND THE DIAMOND DEAD"
STUTSMAN enters the heavily vandalized hall. He shines his
flashlight at an obviously dead the figure on the floor.

He makes his way to the stage and climbs it, passes the
trashed band equipment and walks to the dock doors that open
up on a huge meadow.

HIS POV - NIGHT

On a hill some distance away a bonfire is burning. A skinny
hand taps him on the shoulder and he turns in fright. It
belongs to EDNA his dispatcher, late fifties grey hair. She
is topless.

EDNA
You missed a great show Sheriff.

SHERIFF
Edna? What's going on here?

EDNA
Pretty neat huh?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

SHERIFF
Where's my deputies?

EDNA
They went after the band. Silly
really. They chased them out of
town up, Packer Rd.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

TwO DEPUTIES run for their lives, fleeing an as yet unseen

danger. A DARK SHADOW with glowing red eyes watches the men
run past and laughs quietly to himself. A second DARK SHAPE
also with red eyes leaps past the first shape pursuing the

terrified men.

Up in a tree, a third SHADOW FIGURE leaps from his perch to
the roof of a tomb, then to the ground, crouching like a
gargoyle. He growls in rage and sets off in pursuit.

The TWO TERRIFIED MEN come to a clearing and stop, uncertain
which way to turn as the three menacing specters approach
them from all sides.

A clawed hand slashes downward in a vicious tearing arc. The
FIRST MAN screams as his as his throat is slashed. Blood
squirts out in an arc. In shock the man covers the wound and
the bleeding stops. Surprised the man removes his hand and
the gush of blood resumes. The SECOND MAN turns to look and
comes face to face with a FANGED MOUTH. The FOUR FIGURES drag
the TWO MEN to the ground like a pack of hyenas and begin
tearing at them feverishly.

ANOTHER ANGLE

ARIA DE WINTER stands on the roof of a tomb overlooking the
cemetery. She's carrying an electric guitar and a pig-nose
portable amp. She looks around, turns on the amp and launches
into a grinding guitar solo, silhouetted against the moon.

The shadow creatures crouch over their fresh kill. They lift
their heads looking for the source of the music. The largest
of the monsters stands up and roars at the sky. The others
follow suit. They stand and walk towards the music.

ARIA plays as the four wraiths crawl up the sides of the tomb
toward her. She stops playing as the monsters gain footing
on the roof.

ARIA

(peeved)
Time to go.

The four creatures look at one another and back at ARIA.
SONG: "DEATH ROCKS": ARIA AND THE BAND.
GRAND QUIGNOL - NIGHT

The MARQUEE READS: "Dr. Diabolicus and the Diamond Dead." The
lobby lights turn off, then the signs, and finally the
marquee lights.

A few blocks away FOG rolls in eerily lit with blue light.
Inside the fog, LIGHTNING FLASHES, and there is a BRIGHT
EXPLOSION. The THICK FOG rolls past the theatre as MATHIAS
locks the front doors for the night.

MATHIAS
Fog. Cool.

MATHIAS stands in front of the theatre, turns around and
looks up at the marquee proudly. He shoves his hands in the
pockets of his leather jacket, steps backwards a few feet
into the street and smiles.

MATHIAS (CONT'D)
I own a theater. Life rocks!

The street is deserted and quiet. All we HEAR is the buzz of
the power lines and the neon in the marquee sign. Then
somewhere in the fog MATHIAS hears the sound of souped-up
engines. They becomes louder. MATHIAS stares into the fog but
he can't make out anything.

High on a pole, a transformer explodes sending an electrical
surge down the street. A street light explodes and goes dark
and then another and another.

MATHIAS (CONT'D)
What the hell?

A ball of electricity builds around a junction box forming a
outline of a winged demon. It leaps from the junction box and
streaks past MATHIAS, almost knocking him over. It's
unearthly feed-back scream echoes down the street. MATHIAS
turns around but sees nothing.

MATHIAS (CONT'D)
Holy shit!

ARIA
Mathias Stark?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

MATHIAS turns around. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is standing in front
of him. She's a blonde in her mid-twenties with a sinister
smile on her face. She wears a top hat with a veil and a

black rubber dress.

MATHIAS
Yaah!

ARIA
Did I scare you?

MATHIAS
Yes. Jesus Christ.

ARIA
Good. I'm Aria De Winter

MATHIAS
You're with the band, right?

ARIA
No. They're with me.

MATHIAS
Do you hear 429 engines with
headers, fuel injectors and two
inch straight pipes? Cuz I do.

ARIA
That's the road crew.

Out of the fog come FOUR CUSTOMIZED HEARSES. The DRIVERS are
dressed in nineteenth century costume. They stop in front of
the theatre and wait, unmoving. There is a sound that follows

and reverberates of powerful turbines humming.

MATHIAS
Awesome.

ARIA
Isn't it...

MATHIAS
Your agent said you'd be here
tomorrow.

ARIA
It is tomorrow -- three past
twelve.

MATHIAS

I'm sorry. I was just going home.

CONTINUED: (2)

A TALL GAUNT MAN walks up to ARIA, his arms outstretched. He
holds a scythe on a purple satin pillow.

ARIA
Thank-you, Rasputin. I'll catch up
later.

She takes the scythe. The man bows slightly and walks away.

ARIA (CONT'D)
I bet you're a terribly fascinating
little boy, Mathias. Kinda sexy in
an innocent sort of white meat way.
Do you have any tattoos?

MATHIAS
No.

ARIA
Do you want one?

MATHIAS
I don't know, I...

ARIA
Shame.

Aria twirls the scythe like a baton.
ARIA (CONT'D)
Would it be alright if we went
inside and started setting up?

MATHIAS
Sure. I'll open up for you.

ARIA
Don't bother. We got it.

The transformer over-head explodes sending a surge along the
wire down to the theatre. The lobby lights turn themselves
on, then the sign and the marquee.

MATHIAS
Hey! How'd you do that?

ARIA
Magic. We're in show business.

MATHIAS
Wow.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)

ARIA
C'mon. Let's you and me get a cup
of coffee down the street and leave
the boys to the grunt work.

ARIA tucks her arm around MATHIAS and leads him down the
street.

ARIA (CONT'D)
You're kinda small, aren't ya? Kind
of feminine features.

MATHIAS
Well, I...
ARIA
Don't worry. I like girls, too.
MATHIAS
I think I'm in over my head.
ARIA
Not yet, but if you're lucky, who
knows?
MATHIAS
Help.

ANOTHER ANGLE

ARIA and MATHIAS walk down the street. The telephone wire
becomes a pulse of electricity as it flashes through cables
and wires running under the city, into an urban apartment
building, follows a chord into the back of a television set
into JACK and GEENA'S apartment.

INT. JACK AND GEENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

JACK and GEENA are in their living room. JACK is a young punk
in his mid-twenties: Mohawk, shredded clothes, ridiculous
features. Just plain odd. GEENA is his roommate: young,
beautiful and full of hell with long dark hair and
mischievous eyes. They are sitting in front of the TV looking
catatonic, watching an infomercial.

JACK
What do you wanna do?

GEENA
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

A long silence falls between them.

JACK
We could eat some food.

GEENA
Again? We ate already.

JACK
That was yesterday.

GEENA
Really...D'you think I'm anorexic
or sumthin?

JACK
Where do you wanna eat?

GEENA
I dunno. Where do you wanna eat?

Again, a long silence.

JACK
Seven-eleven.

GEENA
They won't let us in there,
remember. You threw up on the

clerk.
JACK
Oh yeah. Wasn't my fault.
GEENA
How bout the Mud Club?

GEENA
Well, where do you wanna eat then?
JACK
I don't care. Where do you wanna

Long silence.
GEENA

Let's just take a walk and we can
figure it out later.

JACK
Okay.

Neither of them stand up. They continue to stare at the TV.

GEENA
C'mon.

JACK
I can't. The radiation from the TV
has drained my will to resist its
electronic seduction. I have no
will of my own. Turn it off.

GEENA
I can't. You turn it off.
JACK
Oh, God. We're doomed.
GEENA
Victims of a technology we cannot

control.
Jack reaches over the side of the couch and grabs a shoe.
JACK
If I can... just.. reach.. my shoe.
I can... Ugh!
He throws the shoe. It hits the off button on the TV.

GEENA
Thank God.

JACK
That was close. We gotta find that
remote.

GEENA
No shit.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

JACK and GEENA walk down the street. Suddenly Jack stops in
front of a telephone pole.

JACK
Hey Geena, check it out.

GEENA
What?

On the pole is a POSTER for Dr. Diabolicus and the Diamond
Dead.

JACK
Dr. Diabolicus is coming. They kick
some serious ass.

GEENA
Looks like a dirt head metal poser
band to me. I thought you hated
Heavy Metal.

JACK
Dr. D isn't Heavy Metal. They're
a... they're a hard-core grunge

wave rockabillie band. Yeah, a
kinda techno dance neuromantic
retro glam hip hop be bop slamarama
mosh squash. C'mon, you know.

GEENA
They look like a Metal band.

JACK
Yeah, well... they are, but they're
good. Can we go? Huh? Can we? Huh?
Please, Geena? Please?

GEENA
Sure.
JACK

Let's get in line for tickets!

GEENA
It's one o'clock in the morning,
Jack. The box office won't open
until noon.

JACK
Yeah, you're right. We need
sleeping bags and shit. You go get
the supplies and I'll save you a
spot.

GEENA
I really don't think there's going

JACK
Are you sure?
GEENA
Pretty damn sure.
JACK
I wanna be absolutely sure.

EXT. JACKS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT 19

A seedy run down dive. The neon sign explodes leaving only a
few glowing letters. The sign now reads Jack off Shop.

INT. JACK'S COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
MATHIAS and ARIA are having a cup of coffee.

ARIA
You look nervous.

MATHIAS
I'm not nervous. I always look this
way in case something weird
happens.

ARIA
Have you ever seen a Diamond Dead
show before?

MATHIAS
No. But I heard a song or
two....0k, that's a lie, I never

heard of you guys until your agent
called last week. Don't hate me.

ARIA
So you're saying the only reason
we're booked is because we called
first.

MATHIAS
I just inherited the theatre from
my uncle. You have a band. I have a
place to play. Next week I got Devo
unplugged and Crosby Stills Nash
and Rotton. That's gonna suck. But
hey, I'm just staring out.

Thank the Mother it's almost the
apocalypse. I hate time.

MATHIAS
Do you have any music I can listen
to?

ARIA

That's not important. What is
important is that you listen to me.

MATHIAS
Um... Okay.

ARIA
Do you scare easily?

MATHIAS
Yes. Like right now when you asked,
"Do you scare easily?" i think I
just pissed a testicle. I'm kind of
high strung.

ARIA
Do you believe in the supernatural?

MATHIAS
I think the more important question
is: does it believe in me?

ARIA
I'm serious.

MATHIAS
So am I. I figure if I ignore the
spooky shit, it will ignore me. we
kind of formed a mutual non-
interest pact.

ARIA

Well, Mathias, someone just broke
the pact.

MATHIAS
I don't understand.

ARIA
I'm just saying that spooky shit
may happen. But don't worry. It'll
all work out.

MATHIAS
Don't worry? Saying, "Don't worry,"
to someone like me is like a cop
saying, "Bend over, this is a
cavity search!" I'm the king of the
Fearheads! What's to worry about
Aria? Are you a band of Satanic
killers or something? Because if
you are I want it on the record
that I am not a virgin.

ARIA
You seem like a nice guy. It's just
that we attract a weird crowd.
Things don't always follow a
natural pattern with us.

MATHIAS
Sounds like my sex life.
ARIA
Really.
MATHIAS

No, but I like to fantasize.
MATHIAS watches Aria seductively suck on a pickle.
MATHIAS' FANTASY SEQUENCE
MATHIAS is on a giant plate, laying next to the french fries

her mouth.

Quignol.

All strangeness is good. It helps

DARK WRAITHLIKE ROBED FIGURES move along the predawn
abandoned streets tacking up posters for the band. They cover
up a huge billboard advertising the "Holy Church of Good
Intentions", replacing it with the band's logo.

EXT. STREET - MORNING

MATHIAS walks to the theatre. The street is completely
covered in posters. A BUM sleeping in a doorway has a poster
glued to his back.

SONG: "I'M UP WITH THE SUN": MATHIAS.

them into their natural habitat. We
do not harm the bimbo in any way.

PUSSY
Natural habitat?

RASPUTIN
Sure. Shopping malls, biker

raisers... It's all very controlled
and we're saving thousands of
bimbos from extinction every year

PUSSY

No. They do.

RASPUTIN holds up his left hand. Two fingers are missing.

PUSSY
Holy shit!

MATHIAS

RASPUTIN
All I did was wave to Dr.

Dr. Diabolicus and the Diamond
Dead. So, guys,what's it feel like
to be stars?

DR. D
It feels a lot like not being a
star, only with a lot more money.

PUSSY
So, why the darkness? Why the
mystery?

SPYDER SYN raises TWO SOCK PUPPETS on his hands which do his
speaking for him. He wears an iron mask and a long cape that
conceals his emaciated anatomy. His hair, which sticks out
of the top of his mask, is parted in the middle. One side is
dyed white, the other black.

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET

souls are attuned to the darkness.

PUSSY
Who's the man on the end there?

BARTHOLOMEW BANGZ wears a torn tank top T-Shirt and leather
pants. Despite his emaciated condition, his arms are
overdeveloped and muscular. His face is a frozen sneer. He
reminds people of Sid Vicious, if Sid were a beef jerky.

BANGZ

That's Bartholomew Bangz. He
doesn't talk much.

BANGZ
Fuck you. I fuckin' talk like a

You really can't call her a

Alright. You ain't no fucking

ARIA
If I ain't a groupie, what the hell

DR. D
Aw, c'mon, Aria. I apologized.

SPYDER SYN
Not this again.

SPYDER SYN
God, I'm a creep.

DR. D
We now know that our music sucks
according to today's paper. Nixon
is in the White House. Disco is at
its height. And all this diffused
soft focus light they're using in
this scene doesn't help my
headache. Aria sweetie, I would
like to go inside and get killed in
peace. Is that okay with you?

ARIA is angry to the point of tears as Dr. D and the BAND

turn their

backs on her and enter the factory.

ARIA
You prick!

She sits down on an equipment case and begins to cry softly.
GLITTER stops at the door, sets down his arm load of
EQUIPMENT and walks back to the bus. He sits down next to

her.

GLITTER
How old are you, Aria?

ARIA
What does that have to do with
anything?

Well, D's almost forty. He's scared
he's too old for rock.

Either he stops aging or you get
older. Otherwise I don't think you

SPYDER sticks his head out of the door.
SPYDER SYN
Hey, Glitter, Bangz got a new
"Rupture Subwoofer." It's fucking
huge.

The BAND looks at one another.

DR. D
Whoa. Killed a squirrel.

SPYDER SYN
We could cause serious damage to
ourselves. Not to mention the
danger to the audience.

GLITTER
Destroy our hearing, induce

Shorten our lives by decades.

naked, singing "Born Free" with a

cracked.

MATHIAS

Now Bangz just curses and swears

saw must have been bad.

MATHIAS
What about Spyder.

ARIA
Spyder's all right. He only talks
through his puppets. A touch evil,
but on the whole a nice guy. He
works out his problems with his
puppets. A man who wears sock
puppets can't be that dangerous.

How did they become reanimated?

ARIA
After the building they squatted in
collapsed, I just kind of left them
there. Nobody knew they were down

as good as another. Every year on
Halloween I go there and leave
flowers on the rubble...

share a brown paper bag. BANGZ walks up to the door. Over the

Spyder's body flies uncontrolled towards a giant mass in

changing me. Warping me... I

Didn't you read our contract? It
states that in case of accidental
re-death among the band, the show
can be delayed up to one hour.

MATHIAS
How long do you suppose this delay
may be?

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
Depends on whether we get D back in
one piece or several. I hate when
they fight. The results can be
quite disturbing. I never imagined
an entire human leg could be shoved
up any major bodily orifice until I
met Aria.

MATHIAS
Don't tell me anything else. Tell
Aria. I'll see her later.
MATHIAS exits, shaking his head sadly.
EXT. GRAND QUIGNOL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Dr. D and VERONICA step out of the smoking interior of the
car. VERONICA appears immaculate. Dr. D, however, looks like
hell, disheveled, pale and sweaty.
VERONICA
Thank-you, D. That was truly a
revolting experience.

DR. D
We aim to disgust.

VERONICA

DR. D

VERONICA walks off in one direction as ARIA approaches from
another.

DR. D (CONT'D)
Why, Aria... Um... Hi. I was just
thinking about you.

ARIA swings and hits Dr. D in the face. His head SPINS AROUND
UNTIL IT FACES BACKWARDS.

ARIA
You unbelievable prick

DR. D
I deserved that. Do you feel
better?

ARIA stomps on his foot.

DR. D (CONT'D)
Yaah!

AS DR. D tries awkwardly to bend forward with his head on
backwards, aria kicks him in the ass. DR. D flies forward and
his head smashes through the windshield.

ARIA
Curtain in thirty minutes.

Dr. D lies there, stunned. His voice is muffled inside the
hearse.

DR. D
Anything you say, Aria.

ARIA
Damn straight!

ARIA stomps off.

DR. D
It's interesting to me how I can be
such an amazing asshole knowing
that the universe won't let me get
away with jack shit.

INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

VERONICA stands, watching the opening band. SPYDER sticks his
puppets out of one of the dressing room doors. The rest of
his body is beyond the door frame.

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
Hey, shark lady.

VERONICA
Yes.

SPYDER SYN BAD PUPPET
We want to talk to you.

VERONICA
I don't talk to footwear.

SPYDER SYN - BAD PUPPET
I don't usually talk to women who
dress like a plastic action figure,
but it's a new experience.

VERONICA
(moving closer)
What do you want?

SPYDER SYN - BAD PUPPET
Ummmmm. . .

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
We want sex. It's a character flaw
we have.

SPYDER SYN - BAD PUPPET
D had sex, so we want sex, too.

VERONICA
I'm not a vending machine.

SPYDER SYN - BAD PUPPET
How was it with D?

You're one sick sock.

The puppets retreat into the darkness of the room. VERONICA
follows. The voices can be HEARD beyond the room.

VERONICA (0.S.)
What's with the mask?

SPYDER SYN (0.S.)
Would you like to see?

VERONICA (0.S.)
Whatever.

SPYDER SYN (0.S.)

The house is going wild as the audience works itself up into

individual lunacy all add to the chaos.

INT. GRAND QUIGNOL GREEN ROOM - NIGHT

The MEMBERS OF THE BAND are doing final touch-ups, except for
SPYDER, who is unaccounted for.

DR. D and ARIA are purposely ignoring each other. GLITTER
tries to mediate:

GLITTER
D, why don't you talk to Aria?
DR. D
No thanks.
GLITTER
Aria, you talk to D. He loves you.
ARIA
Bullshit.
GLITTER
So what if D slept with another

Yeah. So what?

Ladies and gentlemen. Direct from
the embalmer's table to your town.
The most vile, repugnant, putrid,
twisted abomination ever to clamber
out of the pits of Hell. Ladies and
gentlemen. Won't you please put
your hands together and cover your
mouths when you gag! Dr. Diabolicus
and the Diamond Dead!

The lights come up on the stage. The set is a forced
perspective of a overgrown necropolis on the outskirts of the
bombed out Emerald City of Oz.

Suddenly, there's a BLINDING FLASH and ARIA appears standing
on a TOMB with guitar in hand. She strikes an open chord and
the graves begin to SPLIT. RISING out of the earth, the rest
of the BAND appears.

SONG: "MY LITTLE PIECE OF ARMAGEDDON": THE BAND
EXT. GRAND QUIGNOL - NIGHT
PUSSY talks into the CAMERA. REVEREND SCRUGGS stands nearby.

PUSSY
Hoax or not, the Diamond Dead have
made their debut, despite the
efforts of their critics to protect
the American public form yet
another social pitfall. The right
Reverend Scruggs has joined me to
discuss why he feels so strongly
about the band.

REVEREND
They are an abomination against
God. NTV is an abomination against
God. Rock and roll, sex,
television, computers, non-dairy
creamers, fax machines, and
Unitarian fund-raisers are all
abominations. As far as God is
concerned, there is only one way to
Heaven and that's through me!

MATHIAS
I can't believe I'm still here,
waiting around to be killed. what
the hell am I doing? She's a
musician, for Chrissakes. Hell,
she's Death. She's not my usual
type. It will never work. I
promised myself never to get
involved with any woman who might
be considered an archetype, role
model, star, or in any way
attention-getting. It's not good
for my ego. She's a grim reaper
What happens when she gets tired of
me? I'm afraid of death. I'm afraid
of living. I'm afraid of
everything. My doctor told me to
stay away from dying at all... I
don't feel very good.

INT. GRAND QUIGNOL AUDITORIUM- NIGHT

The BAND is playing on the stage. Dr. D finishes a song and
approaches the microphone.

DR. D
Do you believe in life after death?

CROWD SCREAMS. Dr. D looks over at ARIA who returns his
stare, seething with hate.

DR. D (CONT'D)
Neither do we!

The BAND is playing in the background. RASPUTIN speaks into
his headset.

RASPUTIN
Try to hold them back... Big Boo...
Big Boo?... Come in!

REVEREND SCRUGGS and his FOLLOWERS rush into the theatre,
shooting wildly into the crowd. They charge down the main
aisle toward the stage.

REVEREND
Stop this secular humanistic
debauchery!

The REVEREND fires around, hitting glitter's guitar. The BAND
stops playing. They look at one another, confused, and then
at SCRUGGS. An eerie stillness falls over the confused
CROWD.

The FLOCK opens fire on the stage, pumping hundreds of rounds
into glitter's body, tearing away huge chunks him. The
gunfire continues until the FLOCK has emptied their clips.
What's left of GLITTER crumbles to the ground. The FLOCK
frantically reloads.

RASPUTIN charges onto the stage, followed by TEN ARMED
ROADIES.

RASPUTIN

The REVEREND turns to his flock

REVEREND
We shall be rewarded in Heaven.

The ENTIRE AUDIENCE suddenly JUMPS UP WITH GUNS DRAWN
pointing at SCRUGGS.

REVEREND (CONT'D)
We have exorcised the unclean

SPYDER, Dr. D and BANGZ stand up, armed with machine guns and
walk to the apron. Dr. D is holding a black box. It is
connected to a cable that runs offstage.

MATHIAS runs for the exit. PUSSY talks to the NTV audience.

PUSSY
Guns, fanatics, murder and anarchy.
Live. This is truly an NTV
exclusive.

Dr. D fixes SCRUGGS with a venomous stare. Slowly he raises
the box in Scruggs' direction.

DR. D
Our turn.

REVEREND
Burn in Hell, Satan!

DR. D presses the button on the box and the lights suddenly
go out. The entire theatre ERUPTS in gunfire. It creates a
kind of STROBE LIGHT effect as hundreds of guns fire at once.
The gun battle seems to go on forever before the shooting
finally ceases and the lights are restored. The sound of a
bell tolling twelve midnight can be heard in the distance.
Fog rolls into the house. In its center glides DEATH.

DEATH stands in the middle of the house, knee deep in bodies.
Everybody in the place lies still.

DEATH
Now, I say, I say. That's
entertainment.

ARIA steps onto stage, carrying her scythe. She steps over
PUSSY'S BODY and over to Dr. D'S still form, lying face down.

ARIA
Are you dead?

DR. D
Yes.

She kicks him in the ribs.

DEATH begins climbing over the bodies toward the stage.

DEATH
Excuse me. I say, excuse me little
lady, but I really do need my
scythe back.

ARIA
I need it right now.

DEATH
Why? I know you haven't been making
your quota as a temporary death.
Seems to me you found a novel way
to balance the books.

ARIA
I can't leave things like this.

Dr. D, BANGZ and SPYDER get up and go to GLITTER'S RUINED
CARCASS.

DEATH
I'm afraid you're gonna have to.
Give me my scythe.

Dr.D walks over to ARIA's side.

eternity of endless wandering
torment.

DR. D
Keep it, Aria.

DEATH
We had a bargain missy. It's time
to pay with your life. Even if you
somehow manage to escape me here,
you'll never be allowed to fall in
love or have children or even have
a friend. Death has no friends.

ARIA walks to the edge of the stage and leans over,
presenting the scythe. DEATH reaches for it. ARIA swings the
handle around and cracks DEATH in the jaw with it.

ARIA
I have made more friends since I
became Death. I have never been
happier! You are soooo full of shit
Morty!

DEATH is unfazed and floats onto the stage. ARIA kicks him in
the head. Unfazed, DEATH stands up on the stage. Dr. D flies

at him and is swatted away like a fly. Aria levels her sythe

at death .and Death laughs.

DEATH
Silly meat sack you cant kill me
darlin I aint ever been alive.

Aria hestates the then flips the switch on the sythe
-reverse. And drives into death . The blue arc fly around the
robes.and Then collapse on the ground in a heap. A tiny
little manlike creaturecrawls out ogf the robes and onto the
floor. Its skinny and large eyed.

DEATH (CONT'D)
What have you done . I cant exist
Youve lived me . I cant live!

Deaths body and bones begin to mutate uncontrollably. Growing

impossibly long with extra joints, his rib cage. Folds

ARIA raises the scythe and twirls it over her head.
Lightning FLASHES in arcs from the stage to points in the

house and to the balcony. Lights EXPLODE. The breakers fail
and the theatre is thrown into darkness again.

Slowly the lights return and the SLAIN rise, including
REVEREND SCRUGGS and his flock, everybody except GLITTER
whose only remaining feature is his SKULL. Respectfully,
SPYDER carries it offstage.

Everybody's afraid of death. It's
an unknown. People feel powerless
against it. Some folks will see us
as having the power to help them
beat death. Others will see us and
think if they can beat us, they can
beat death. Either way, every show
we play is going to be a slaughter.

BANGZ
Fuck them.

SPYDER SYN

D's right. It's over.

SPYDER SYN(CONT'D)

Besides, we did what we came to do.
We fucked with everybody. One last
time.

BANGZ
Buggered by pansy ass fearheads.
This fuckin' sucks.

SPYDER SYN
(Good puppet)
We better go underground.

DR. D
We can't hide.
BANGZ
Oh God. Not the fuckin' white light
again.
DR. D
Yup.
BANGZ

Shit! What about Aria?

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
You love her right?

DR. D
Ahhh! She doesn't need me. She
needs that little poser sissy. I
finally figured it out. I love me.
I'm what I need to be happy. I'm
too damn me. And nobody should have
to deal too much with my meanness.

SPYDER SYN - BAD PUPPET
That is either the most noble thing
you have ever said or the most
disgusting.
rough the lobby doors into the house.

QUIGNOL - NIGHT

DR. D, BANGZ and SPYDER enter. Standing on stage is VERONICA
VINYL, holding Aria's scythe.

VERONICA
Hello, boys.

BANGZ
Hey, it's the fuckin' rubber lady.

(CONTINUED)
125.
CONTINUED:

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
Told you I didn't eat her.

VERONICA
Hello, Spyder honey.

SPYDER SYN - BAD PUPPET
Where ya been?

SPYDER climbs onto the stage.
SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
D. Bangz, this is Veronica, soon to
be Mrs. Syn.
VERONICA
Sorry, Spyder honey, but the
engagement's off.

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET

Why?

VERONICA
I could never marry you. You're a
freak.

Veronica swings the scythe and buries it in Spyder's chest.

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
What a woman.

VERONICA draws back the weapon and levels it at Dr. D and
BANGZ. SPYDER stumbles back a few steps.

DR. D
You're a real femme fatale, ain't
ya?

VERONICA

It's nothing personal, D. It's a

Presidential secret order. I have
to do you guys. It's my job. Not

that I don't enjoy my work. I do,
but you guys are different

SPYDER removes the sock puppets from his hands. BANGZ and Dr
D slowly approach VERONICA.

VERONICA (CONT'D)

Don't come any closer. I know how
to use this scythe.

CONTINUED: (2)

DR. D
Go ahead. I'm not afraid of death.

BANGZ
Yeah. Big fuckin' deal.

DR. D
We're already dead.

SPYDER walks up behind VERONICA unseen. He removes his mask.

Where spyder's head should be, there is a huge balled fist.
Slowly, long taloned digits unfurl. SPYDER'S head is a giant
clawed hand.

Dr. D and BANGZ look surprised. VERONICA reads their
expressions and turns around. She screams. VERONICA flips the
forward switch and the scythe activates.

SPYDER'S fist envelopes Veronica's head and squeezes. Blood
erupts between the fingers. VERONICA drops the still
activated scythe.

Dr. D picks it up without turning it off. SPYDER drops
VERONICA'S gory remains and puts his natural arm on Dr. D's
shoulder. BANGZ joins them as the LIGHTNING ARCS off the
blade.

DR. D (CONT'D)
Better to burn out than to fade
away...

Together, the BAND rots, dries up, and blows away in seconds.
The scythe falls to the ground, clattering noisily on the
empty stage.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

ARIA and MATHIAS stand on the shoulder of the road, having
just stepped out of Mathias' Stingray.

ARIA
Sure you don't want to come with?

MATHIAS
No. I'm committing myself ina
couple hours.

ARIA

Suit yourself. What about your
theatre?

(CONTINUED)
127.
CONTINUED:

MATHIAS smiles sheepishly. In the distance we HEAR the sound
of a massive explosion. He looks at Aria, as if to say "See,
I'm fucked".

MATHIAS
I'm insured but thanks anyway.

ARIA
I'm gonna miss you.

MATHIAS
I'll miss you too, in a strange
masochistic, romantic, terrified
way. I'm sorry about your band. I'm
sorry about your... you know... um
boyfriend.

ARIA
I'm gonna miss a lot of things. Oh
well, that's life.

MATHIAS
According to death?

ARIA
That's me.

MATHIAS gets in the car.
MATHIAS
You're truly special. You know
that, don't you?

ARIA
Of course. I'm not stupid.

MATHIAS starts his car and drives off.
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
MATHIAS is talking to himself.

MATHIAS
This sucks.

A hearse going the other direction screams past MATHIAS.
EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
ARIA begins to walk down the road, her scythe over her

shoulder and a head-shaped bundle wrapped in butchers paper
in her hand.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

A car speeds past her and then slams on it's brakes. It isa
'57 Cadillac hearse. ARIA smiles and gets in. The hearse
roars it's engine and takes off for the vanishing point.
ANOTHER ANGLE

MATHIAS slams on his brakes and power slides 180 degrees. And
roars after the hearse.

MATHIAS
Rock and Roll ! This is crazy! This
is crazy!
