LAST STACE TO RED BoOtk
EXT - WHITE WINTER WYOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE - SNOWY DAY

A breathtaking 70MM filmed (as is the whole movie) snow covered
mountain range.

A staggering opening vista, set to appropriately nerve jangling
music.

Then in the bottom left of this big 70MM SUPER CINEMASCOPE FRAME,

we see a STAGECOACH being pulled by a team of SIX HORSES rip
snorting through the bottom of the landscape.

CUT TO

EXT - STAGECOACH (MOVING) - SNOWY DAY

Now, still in big super CINEMASCOPE 70MM filmed gloriousness, we
follow along with the lone STAGECOACH DRIVER fighting and guiding
these six horses to shelter.

We follow alongside the HORSES, working our way from the back horse
in mid stride, to the tip of the lead horses nose.

We follow along the twelve horse hooves as they tear up and spit
out snow and dirt.

We take the DRIVER'S POV down the hurtling six horse team.

We follow along the big stagecoach WAGON WHEEL, then up to the
stagecoach door WINDOW (complete with curtains). Which beyond we
can make out the figures of a MAN and a WOMAN sitting side by side.
70MM CU of The STAGECOACH DRIVER 0.B. (pronounced Obie) as he whips
the horses forward, keeps the wheels on the road, and avoids the
rocks.

Then.......

...-he see's something up ahead.

He pulls back on the reins.

CU HORSE MOUTH
as reins are pulled back.

Their HOOVES
Slowing in the snow.

O.B.
still fighting the reins.
The HORSES
still trying to stop their vigorous glide. Snorting and coughing
HOT BREATH, the horses finally settle to a stop.

O.B.
calms the halted horses, as he looks straight ahead and down at the
impediment to his vehicle's progress.

0.B.'s POV:

What O.B. see's on the road is a BLACK MAN in the middle of it,
sitting on a nice leather saddle, laid on top of THREE FROZEN DEAD
WHITE MEN, smoking a pipe (the Black Man, not the three dead white
guys).

The BLACK MAN
removes the pipe from his mouth and says to the the man behind the six
snorting horses;

BLACK MAN
Got room for one more?

o.B.

looks at the Black Man sitting on the three dead white men in the
middle of the road, smoking a pipe, amongst falling snow flakes,
and says;

O.B.
Who the hell are you, and what happened
to them?

The BLACK MAN is a older man. A sly LEE VAN CLEEF type with a bald
pate, silver hair on the sides, a distinguished mustache, and a
tall slim frame. He wears the dark blue uniform pants of the U.S.
CALVARY, with the yellow stripe down the side of the pant leg,
tucked into black regulation Calvary riding boots. His shirt and
undergarment's is non regulation and worn for comfort, style, and
warmth, including a long charcoal grey wool scarf. But his dark
heavy winter coat is his OFFICER WINTER COAT from the U.S. Calvary.

On top of his bald pate he wears a supercool non regulation COWBOY
HAT he picked up sometime after the war.

The NORTHERN OFFICER says;

MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN
Names Major Marquis Warren former U.S.
Calvary. Currently I'm a servant of the
court.

The Northern Officer stands up from his saddle perch on the three
frozen dead white men.
MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN

(CON'T)
These are a coupla' no-goods i'm bringin'
into market. I got the paperwork on ‘em
in my pocket.

O.B.
You takin' i'm into Red Rock?

MAJ .WARREN
I figure that's where you goin', right?

We see a terrible BLIZZARD kicking up in the BACKGROUND. The
stagecoach has obviously been trying to beat it to shelter.

O.B.
That damblasted blizzards been on our
ass for the last three hours. Ain't no
way we gonna' make it all the way to Red
Rock 'fore it catches us.

MAJ.WARREN
So ya' hightailin' it halfway to Minnie's
Haberdashery?
O.B.
You know I am.
MAJ .WARREN
May I come aboard?
O.B.
Well smoke, it up to me, yes. But it ain't
up to me.
MAJ .WARREN
Who's it up to?
O.B.
Fella' in the wagon.
MAJ.WARREN
Fella' in the wagon not partial to
company?
O.B.

This ain't the regular line. The fella'
in the wagon paid for a private trip.

And i'm here to tell ya' he paid a pretty
penny for privacy. So if you wanna’ go

to Minnie's with us.....you gotta’ talk
to him.
to

MAJ .WARREN
Well i suppose i'll do that.

MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN starts to walk around to the stagecoach door,
when a rifle barrel comes out of the window pointing at the former
officer.

We hear a HAMMER CLICK.
The VOICE BEHIND THE RIFLE yells out;

VOICE BEHIND THE RIFLE (0S)
Hold it black fella'!

Marquis Warren stops.

VOICE BEHIND THE RIFLE (0S)
(CON'T)
‘Fore you approach, you take them two
guns of yours and lay ‘em on that rock
over yonder. Then you raise both your
hands way above your hat. Then you come
forward....molasses-like.

Maj.Warren looks up at 0.B. and says;
MAJ .WARREN
(to 0.B.)
Real trustin' fella', huh?
o.B.
(to Maj.Warren)
Not so much.

Maj.Warren walks over to the rock that the voice behind the rifle
chose as a good place for Marquis to relieve himself of his weapons.

He places two revolvers hanging on his hip on said rock.

Then raising his hands above his hat, he slowly approach's the
stagecoach.

We see a bit of a face and a hat in the dark beyond the window
frame in the stagecoach door.

The voice behind the rifle snaps;

VOICE BEHIND THE RIFLE (0S)
That's far enough!

The Major stops.
The rifle barrel is taken inside the window...
Then....

..-.the fella' in the wagon KICKS OPEN the stagecoach door so
Maj.Warren can see inside.

The FELLA' IN THE WAGON is a rough looking white man lawman type,
with a drop dead black hat and a walrus like mustache above his top

lip.
He one arms a rifle in Maj.Warren's direction.

The other arm is handcuffed to the wrist of The FEMALE
PASSENGER/PRISONER in the stagecoach with him. She sits across from
him, her wrist cuffed to his wrist, his cuffed hand holding a pistol,
the pistol pointed at her belly.

This once pretty WHITE LADY (maybe before the trip, maybe years ago)
wears a once pretty dress, and a once sexy smirk.

The TWO GUNNED MOUSTACHED MAN says;

TWO GUNNED MOUSTACHED MAN
Well i'1l be dogged, you a black fella‘
i know. Col.Something Warren, right?

MAJ.WARREN
Major Marquis Warren. I remember you too.
We shared a steak dinner in Chattanooga
once upon a time. You John Ruth, The Hangman.

JOHN RUTH
That be me.

(beat)
How longs that been?

MAJ.WARREN
Since that steak? Eight months.

JOHN RUTH
What brings you out in this shit?

MAJ .WARREN
I'm tryin' to get a coupla' of bounty's
to Red Rock.

JOHN RUTH
So you still in business?

MAJ.WARREN
You know I am.
i= JOHN RUTH
What happened to your horse?

MAJ .WARREN
He wasn't no spring chicken. The cold got
to 'em. He couldn't make it.

JOHN RUTH
You don't know nothin' about this filly
here?

Motioning towards the woman with the barrel of his pistol.

MAJ.WARREN
Nope.

JOHN RUTH
Don't even know her name?

MAJ.WARREN
Nope.

JOHN RUTH

Well i guess that makes this one
fortuitous wagon.

cn MAJ.WARREN
I sure as hell hope so.

John Ruth makes the introductions;

JOHN RUTH
Major Marquis Warren, this here is Daisy
Domergue. Domergue, to you, this is
Maj.Warren.

While keeping his hands raised, Maj.Warren touches the brim of his
hat and nods slightly in her direction.

DAISY DOMERGUE (pronounced DAHMER-GOO) gives Maj.Warren a opened
handed wave with her free hand and says with a smile;

DOMERGUE
Howdy nigger!

That makes John Ruth chuckle and Maj.Warren frown.

JOHN RUTH
(to Maj.Warren)
She's a pepper, ain't she?
(to Domergue)
ro Now girl, don't you know darkee's don't
like bein' called niggers no more.
They find it offensive.
ro DOMERGUE
I been called worse.

JOHN RUTH
Now that I can believe.
(To Maj-.Warren)
Heard of her?

MAJ .WARREN
Should I?

JOHN RUTH
Well she ain't no John Wilkes Booth.
But maybe you might of heard tell 'bout
the price on her head.

MAJ .WARREN
How much?
JOHN RUTH
Ten thousand dollars.
MAJ .WARREN
Damn, what she do? Kill Lily Langtree?
(a MAJ .WARREN
Not quite. Now that ten thousands

practically in my pocket. It's why I
ain't too anxious to be handin' out RIDES.
Especially to professional's open for business.

MAJ .WARREN
Well i sure can appreciate that. Only i
ain't got no designs on 'er. One of my
fella's is worth four thousand, one's
worth three thousand, and one's worth
one. That's damn sure good enough for me.

JOHN RUTH

(meaning the three

dead white guys)
Who are them fella's?

MAJ .WARREN
Warren Vanders, Homer Van Hootin, and
Rebel Roy McCrackin.

JOHN RUTH
Let me see their paper work. Like i said,
molasses-like.

co Maj.Warren slowly removes the handbills from his winter coat
pocket.
John Ruth lowers his rifle from Maj.Warren's chest, and takes the
papers to study. He removes from his pocket a pair of spindly gold
framed reading glasses that he applies to his face.

O.B., up on his drivers seat perch, yells back at them;

O.B.

(yelling)
Look, I sure hate to interrupt y'all!
But we gotta' cold damn blizzard hot on
our ass we tryin' to beat to shelter!

JOHN RUTH

(yelling back)
I realize that! Now shut your mouth and
hold them damn horses while i think!

The grizzled guy studies the handbills.

Then raises both of his eyes and the brim of his hat to study the
black Major still standing with his hands raised.

John Ruth makes up his mind.

JOHN RUTH
Okay boy, we'll give it a try. But you
leave those pistols over yonder with
the driver.

Daisy Domergue says;

DOMERGUE
You ain't really gonna' let that nigger
in here is ya'? I mean maybe up there
with O.B., but not in here -

John Ruth takes the pistol in his cuffed hand, switches it to his
free hand, and brings the iron weapon down hard on the side of
Daisy's skull with a sickening CRACKING SOUND. This knocks the
woman on to the floor of the stagecoach on her hands and knee's.
Blood trickles from her hair, and runs down the side of her face.

John Ruth leans his big hulking frame over her on the stagecoach
floor, and says with real grit;

JOHN RUTH
How you like the sound of them bells,
bitch? Real pretty, ain't they?
You open up your trashy mouth again,
I'11 knock out them front teeth for ya'.
You got it?
From the floor, Domergue says;

DOMERGUE
Yeah.

Yanking her cuffed wrist hard with his arm.

JOHN RUTH
Let me hear you say; "I got it".

Domergue looks up at the brute with hate flashing in her eyes, and
says;

DOMERGUE
I got it.

JOHN RUTH
You damn well better.

After Ruth is through dealing with Domergue, he turns back to face
Maj.Warren.

MAJ .WARREN
I'm gonna need some help tiein' these
fella's up on the roof.

JOHN RUTH
Give 0.B. fifty dollars when ya' get to
Red Rock, and he'll help ya'.

MAJ .WARREN
Well, I think 0.B.'s right. That storms
got me kinda' concerned. We get goin'
a lot faster you help too.

JOHN RUTH

(irritated)
Goddamit to hell, I'm already regretting
this! Now i can't likely help ya' tie
fella's to the roof with my wrist cuffed
to hers. And my wrist is gonna' stay
cuffed to hers, and she ain't never gonna’
leave my goddamn side, untill i personally
put her in the Red Rock jail! Now do you
got that?

MAJ.WARREN
Yeah, I got it.

Maj.Warren walks over to 0.B. on his drivers perch.
lo.

MAJ .WARREN
You help me tie these fella's up on the
roof, I'll make it worth your while, we
get to Red Rock.

O.B.
I hear you makin' eight thousand off
these dead fuckers?

MAJ .WARREN
Yeah.

O.B.
I'll help ya' for two hundred and fifty
dollars.

MAJ .WARREN

How 'bout a hundred and fifty dollars,
and first two days we in Red Rock, I pay
for all your booze. They got 'em a social
club in Red Rock?

O.B.
Why yes they do.

MAJ .WARREN
I'll stake ya' a night there too.
Now that's a good deal, son.
0.B. lights up.

O.B.
Shit fire, that's a damn good deal!

He leaps to the ground, and shakes hand with the black Major.
O.B.
You gotta' deal, smoke. Let's get to it.

TIME CUT

EXT - SNOW WHITE WYOMING MOUNTAIN ROAD - SNOWY DAY

SLOW MOTION EMPTY FRAME

We hear the slow motion sounds of the horses running and grunting
through cold. Then we see the noses of the two lead horses bob into
FRAME. Then with a little more effort on their part, their Face.

SLOW MOTION HORSE HOOVES
tear and kick up the snow as they move forward.
We only hear the slow motion horse sounds.
Ut.

aay INT - STAGECOACH (MOVING) - SNOWY DAY

MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN
sits on one side of the stagecoach, preparing his pipe for smoking.

JOHN RUTH & DAISY DOMERGUE
attached at the wrists, sit beside each other on the opposite side
of the wagon.

John Ruth's pistol is pulled and sit's on his lap. Barrel lazily
pointed in the direction of Domergue.......

se eeeee or Maj.Warren...if need be.

JOHN RUTH
prepares his pipe for smoking as well.

JOHN RUTH
So what happened to your horse?

MAJ .WARREN
He was pretty old. I done had him for
a bit. When the weather took a turn for
the worse, it got to be too much for 'em.

JOHN RUTH
as That's too bad.

MAJ .WARREN
Yes it is. Me an' ole Lash rode alotta
miles together. You might say he was my
best friend - if i considered stupid
animals friends....which i don't.
Never the less....I'm gonna' miss 'em.

John Ruth lights his pipe with a MATCH STROKE;

JOHN RUTH
I had a horse like that once. - bout
twenty years ago. Called 'em Cauliflower.
Use to call 'em my "beast friend".

MAJ .WARREN
What happened to him?

JOHN RUTH
Some rattlesnakes shot 'em out from
under me.

Maj.Warren lights his pipe with a MATCH STROKE off the heel of his
boot.

MAJ .WARREN

Didja' make it right?
I2.

co

The black man touches the match flame to the tobacco in the pipe
bowl.

John Ruth PUFFS some SMOKE out of the side of his walrus mustache;
JOHN RUTH
Oh, you know i did.

WE CUT TO

EXT - SNOW WHITE WYOMING MOUNTAIN ROAD - SNOWY DAY
OVERHEAD SHOT - SLOW MOTION

The six horse pulled stagecoach with three dead frozen men now tied
to the roof, rides through FRAME.

WE CUT TO

BACK INTO THE STAGECOACH (MOVING)

MAJ .WARREN
smokes his pipe.

JOHN RUTH
smokes his pipe.

Then all of a sudden, John Ruth gets a little sheepish, and asks;

JOHN RUTH

(to Maj.Warren)
I know we only met each other once
before. And i don't mean to unduly
imply intimacy. But-a......do you
still got it?

Maj.Warren knowing perfectly well what the old dog is referring to;

MAJ .WARREN
Do i still got, what?

JOHN RUTH
+--the Lincon letter?

MAJ .WARREN
Of course.

JOHN RUTH
Do you got it on you?

Maj.Warren nods his hat brim, yes.
13.

JOHN RUTH
Where?

Maj.Warren takes two fingers and points at his heart.

MAJ .WARREN
Right here.

JOHN RUTH
Look, i know you gotta' be real careful
with it and all. I can imagine you
probably don't want to take it in an'out
of the envelope all that often. But if
you wouldn't mind, I'd sure appreciate
seein' it again.

MAJ .WARREN
Well, like you said, i don't like taking
it in an' out of the envelope that often.
However seein' as your saving my life an'
all, i suppose i could let you read it
again.

John Ruth breaks into a big grin.

Maj.Warren carefully takes out a envelope from his inside jacket
pocket.

John Ruth watches the envelope....

Maj-.Warren ever so carefully removes the letter inside the
envelope.....

John Ruth puts on his spindly reading glasses.

+--.-then carefully opens up the letter from it's folded position...
++.then hands the open letter to John Ruth.

Daisy Domergue has no idea whats up with this letter.

JOHN RUTH READS

the letter. Moving his lips along with the words, but not saying
them out loud.

MAJ.WARREN WATCHES
him read.

John Ruth looks up from the letter, to Maj.Warren sitting across
from him.
14,

JOHN RUTH
(reading from
the letter)
"Ole Mary Todds callin', so I guess it
must be time for bed"
«+.--Ole Mary Todd.....
(to Maj.Warren)
That gets me.

MAJ .WARREN
That gets me too.

John Ruth turns to Domergue, and holds out the letter in front of
her.

JOHN RUTH
You know what this is, tramp? It's a
letter from Lincoln. It's a letter from
Lincoln to him.

(pointing at

Maj.Warren)
They shared a correspondence during the
war. They was pen pals. This is just one
of the letters.

Daisy Domergue looks over at the letter with interest....
THEN....

HOUCKS UP A LUGI
and SPITS it on the letter with a BIG SPLAT!

This shocks both Maj.Warren and John Ruth.

MAJ.WARREN SLAMS his FIST into the right side of DOMERGUE'S
FACE....so hard....he ends up punching her into the stagecoach
door with such force....IT FLIES OPEN....and DOMERGUE TUMBLES OUT
of the six horse pulled vehicle.....the handcuff chain taking JOHN
RUTH WITH HER...as well as the Lincoln letter.

EXT - STAGECOACH ROAD - SNOWY DAY

Daisy Domergue and John Ruth go flying out of the speeding wagon,
tumbling and somersaulting in the snow.

O.B. pulls up on the reigns yelling at the ponies, bringing the
fast steeds to a slushy stop.

John Ruth lies in the snow, still chained to the dazed Domergue,
holding his arm in pain.
15 -

JOHN RUTH

(cursing at

the cold)
...0f all the stupid - Like to rip my
goddamn arm off!

Maj.Warren climbs out of the stopped vehicle.

John Ruth takes out a SMALL KEY, and for the first time in the
story, UNLOCKS the handcuffs that tie him to his female prisoner.

For the moment...both John Ruth and Daisy Domergue are free.

He doesn't want to, but his arm hurts like dickins, and he has to
walk it off.

Daisy Domergue, spits some blood from her mouth into the snow. She
touches her freed wrist. She watches John Ruth walk off the pain in
his shoulder. "Awww, he hurt his arm, ain't that too bad", she
thinks to herself.

Maj.Warren looks for his Lincoln letter.
John Ruth yells at the Union Officer;

JOHN RUTH
I didn't drag her stinkin’ ass up this
goddamn mountain, just for you to break
her neck on the outskirts of town!

MAJ .WARREN
You the one handed her my goddamn letter.
I didn't give it to her, i gave it to
you!

JOHN RUTH
Okay, it's both of our faults.

Maj.Warren gives him a look. Then goes back to looking for his
special presidential correspondence.

John Ruth's arm feels a little better. He approaches the fallen
Domergue, with a RIFLE in his hand.

With bloody teeth Domergue looks up at Ruth and says;

DOMERGUE
That nigger like to bust my jaw.

JOHN RUTH
You ruin that letter of his, that niggers
gonna' stomp your ass to death. And when
he do, I'm gonna sit back on that wagon
wheel watch and laugh.
\6.

Maj.Warren finds the letter.
It's worse for the wear, but still intact.
John Ruth calls to him;

JOHN RUTH
How is it?

MAJ .WARREN
She didn't help it none. But it's
allright.

Maj.Warren puts the Lincoln letter back in it's envelope, then puts
the envelope back in the pocket of his winter jacket.

Then the colored Union Officer scoops up a handful of snow, and
crafts a snowball. He looks at Domergue.

She looks at him.
DOMERGUE
Is that the way niggers treat their
ladies?
Maj.Warren throws the snowball in her face.

MAJ . WARREN
You ain't no lady.

Maj.Warren trod's off in the snow.
John Ruth looks down at her.

JOHN RUTH
Your about one wise word from being tied
up on the roof with them other fella's.
Now pick your trash ass up, and haul it
back in that coach. Open your mouth again,
and i'll feed it a knucklesanwhich.

0.B. the Stagecoach Driver calls from OFFSCREEN;

0.B. (0S)
Hey mister Ruth?

Answering without turning around;

JOHN RUTH
What?

0.B. (0S)
We got another fella' on foot, up here
on the road!
17,

Turning towards 0O.B.

JOHN RUTH
What?

MAJ.WARREN & O.B.
look down the road at the lone figure trying to get their
attention. John ruth, rifle in hand, joins them.

POV:
way way down the snow covered road, a lone tiny figure of a man
waves a lantern, trying to get there attention.

JOHN RUTH

(to Maj.Warren)
Considering there's a blizzard goin' on,
whole lotta' fella's walkin' around,
wouldn't you say, Major?

The Major looks at Mr.Ruth.

MAJ .WARREN
Considering I'm one half of them fella's
++...yeah....seems to be a lot of us.

John Ruth points down the road.

JOHN RUTH
You know that fella'?

MAJ .WARREN
I know me some people ‘round here.
I spent a lotta' time on this mountain
hidin' out from bushwackers. So maybe I
know that fella', and maybe I don't.
But i wasn't expecting nobody.

JOHN RUTH
You wern't, aye?

MAJ .WARREN
No I wern't.

John Ruth lowers the rifle barrel, till it's pointed at Maj.Warren.

JOHN RUTH
This changes things, son.

(beat)
Eight thousand dollars a lotta' money
for a nigger. But with a partner....
...eighteen's a whole lot better.
I%.

Maj.Warren does.

Maj-.Warren does.

MAJ .WARREN
I don't have a partner no more.

JOHN RUTH
So you say.

MAJ .WARREN
Why don't you take a gander at those
three frozen fuckers up there. You won't
find no holes in there back. Well, okay,
Maybe not Rebel Roy McCracken, him i did
shoot in the back. But shitfire, he
deserved it. He not only shot my partner,
he tried to steal my damn horse.

JOHN RUTH
(to Maj.Warren)
Turn around.

JOHN RUTH
Put your hands behind your head.

MAJ . WARREN
You really think i'm in cahoots wit that
fella'? Or her?

John Ruth CUFFS Maj.Warren's wrists behind his back.

JOHN RUTH
That's my problem boy, I don't know.
And until i do, you in chains.

ron EXT - SNOW COVERED STAGECOACH ROAD - DAY

The CAMERA is behind The STRANGER ON THE ROAD, who's facing the
horses, the stagecoach, and 0.B. the stagecoach driver.

The wind has picked up more, befitting the coming blizzard.
John Ruth's Voice yells out from inside the wagon;

JOHN RUTH'S VOICE (0S)
Hand your weapons to the driver.

STRANGER ON THE ROAD
Little jumpy, ain't you?

JOHN RUTH'S VOICE (0S)
Never mind the jokes, just do it.

STRANGER ON THE ROAD
If you say so.

JOHN RUTH'S VOICE (0S)
I do.

The Stranger on the road, takes the pistol hanging from the gun
ro belt on his hip, and hands it up to 0.B.

STRANGER ON THE ROAD
Okay, I done did it.

JOHN RUTH'S VOICE (0S)
O.B.? Ya' got 'em?

JOHN RUTH'S VOICE (0S)
Okay fella', keep holdin' that lantern
with that one hand, and keep that other
hand where i can see it. Walk around here
where i can get a good look at cha’.
Real slow like.

Keeping his back to the camera, The Stranger with hands raised,
walks to the stagecoach.

When he gets to the side of the stagecoach, he see's John Ruth's
head framed in one of the stagecoach door windows. The other window
has both it's window blind rolled down, and it's curtains closed.

f™\ John Ruth gets a good gander at The Stranger.

The Young Stranger, with his arm raised, holding the lantern with
the wind whipping around him, says;

STRANGER ON THE ROAD
I'm sorry friend, do we know each other?

JOHN RUTH
Not quite.

INT - STAGECOACH (STILL) - WINDY DAY

Inside the coach, with the doors closed, Maj.Warren, with his hands
cuffed behind his back, says to John Ruth;

MAJ .WARREN
You know this fella'?

JOHN RUTH
(to Maj.Warren)
Only by reputation.

EXT - STAGECOACH ROAD - DAY

STRANGER ON THE ROAD
Like i said friend, you got me at a
bit of a disadvantage.

JOHN RUTH
Keepin' you at a disadvantage, is a
advantage I intend to keep.

STRANGER ON THE ROAD
Whoever you are mister, you sure sound
tough when your talkin' to a desperate
man knee deep in snow. But i don't want

MAJ .WARREN
Mannix's Marauders?

JOHN RUTH
That's them. The scourge of South
Carolina, Mannix's Marauders. That's
Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.

EXT - STAGECOACH ROAD - DAY

JOHN RUTH
What brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?

CHRIS MANNIX
A early thirties, untrustworthy, rotten teeth hillbilly, with a
admittedly FLY WINTER OUTFIT, complete with COOL COWBOY HAT.

CHRIS MANNIX
Well Mr.Face, i was riding to Red Rock
and my horse stepped in a gofer hole in
the snow, fucked up his leg, an' had to
put ‘er down.

John Ruth gives Maj.Warren a sarcastic look.

CHRIS
Well I ain't the sheriff yet. Once I get
there they swear me in, but that ain't
happened yet. And that's when you get

the star.
JOHN RUTH
You got anything that can back any of
this up?
CHRIS
Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.
JOHN RUTH
Not even a telegram....you know, like

when they hired ya'?

CHRIS
I travel light.

(beat)
And from the look of those three frozen
fuckers up there,

(pointing at the

stagecoach roof)
I figure your a bounty hunter open for
business. And I figure your taking
them three dead bodies into Red Rock
to get paid?
23,

The bounty hunter leans forward, and brings up the window shade on
wr the other stagecoach door, reveling Domergue, and Maj.Warren
sitting next to her.

JOHN RUTH
Three dead. One alive.

Chris and Daisy meet eyes.

CHRIS
Who's that?

JOHN RUTH
Daisy Domergue.

CHRIS
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?

JOHN RUTH
Not a goddamn thing to nobody, except
me and the hangman.

Chris finally gets a good gander at the men inside the wagon.

CHRIS
Well i'11 be double dogged dammed.
Your The Hangman, Bob Ruth.
o
JOHN RUTH

It's John.
And spotting Maj.Warren in there too.

CHRIS
And you....your the nigger with the
head....Major Marquis. My lord, is that
really the real head of Major Marquis
lookin' at me now?

MAJ .WARREN
I'm really me, and it's really my head.

CHRIS
Boy oh boy...there was a time...What's goin’
on, you havin' a bounty hunters picnic?
- Never mind - you takin' in them three
and her to Red Rock to get paid, ain't ya'?

JOHN RUTH
Yeah.
24.

CHRIS
Well the man in Red Rock suppose to pay
ya' is me. The new sheriff. So if you
wanna' get paid, you need to get me to
Red Rock.

JOHN RUTH
Well excuse me for findin' it hard to
believe a town electin' you to do
anything except drop dead.
CHRIS
So i'm suppose to freeze, 'cause you find
something hard to believe?
INT - STAGECOACH (STILL)
John Ruth considers the choice.
He looks to Maj.Warren.
Maj.Warren looks back, take him or leave him, it's up to you.

JOHN RUTH
I suppose not.

The bounty hunter KICKS the stagecoach door open. He removes the
last set of handcuffs from off his belt, and tosses them in the
snow at Chris' feet.

JOHN RUTH
Put them on and come inside.

Chris Mannix bends down and picks up the handcuffs at his feet.
He examines them in his hand.

Then he tosses them back inside the stagecoach, they land on the
wood floor with a LOUD THUMP.

CHRIS
No.

JOHN RUTH
Then you'll freeze.

CHRIS
Then you'll hang.

JOHN RUTH
How so?
25.

O.B.

climbs down

CHRIS

(to 0.B.)
Driver! Could you come down here and
join us?

off his perch and joins the conversation.

CHRIS

(to 0.B.)
You heard me tell this fella' I'm the
new sheriff of Red Rock, right?

O.B.
Yeah.

CHRIS

(to John Ruth)
Red Rock is my town now. And i'm gonna’
enter my town, in bounty hunters chains?
No-Sir! Chains of a nigger and a nigger
lover? I ain't entering Red Rock that
way, bushwackers.

(to 0.B.)
When you finally get to Red Rock. Your
gonna' realize every goddamn thing i
said was true. And i expect you, 0.B.,
to tell the townsfolk of Red Rock that
John Ruth let their new sheriff freeze
to death.

(to John Ruth)
There ain't no bounty on my head,
bushwacker. You let me die, that's
murder.

Chris Mannix just said a mouthful. A mouthful John Ruth chews in
silence.

Maj.Warren breaks it...

MAJ .WARREN
John?

John Ruth looks to him.

MAJ .WARREN
He's right.

John Ruth makes up his mind.

JOHN RUTH
(to Maj.Warren)
Turn around.
26.

[7 John Ruth takes the TINY KEY out of his pocket, and unlocks the
black man's handcuffs. Every time John Ruth takes out that key
Domergue clocks it.

JOHN RUTH

(to 0.B.)
0.B., give the Major back his iron.

(to the Major)
One thing i know is this nigger-hatin'
son of a gun ain't partnered up with
you. I'll help you protect your eight
thousand, you help me protect my ten,
deal?

MAJ .WARREN
Deal.

They shake hands.
CHRIS

Ain't love grand. Y'all wanna' lie
on the ground and make snow angles

together?
JOHN RUTH
0.B., I said, give the Major back his
(~ iron!

0.B. leans in the wagon and hands the Major his two pistols back.

The black man puts one back in it's holster, and the other he rests
lazy on his lap.

John Ruth YANKS Daisy Domergue back next to him.

Chris Mannix enters the coach, and sits in the space next to
Maj.Warren.

Before he climbs back up on his perch, 0.B. closes the stagecoach
door, and says to the passengers through the window;

O.B.
From here on end, no more stops. Or
ain't none of us gonna’ make it to
Minnie's.

0.B. disappears from the window, back up to his perch on the
drivers seat. he whips the six horses to life, and the whole wagon
rushes away.

INT - STAGECOACH (MOVING) - DAY

MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN & CHRIS MANNIX
sit on one side.

John Ruth with his wrist handcuffed to Daisy Domergue sits on the
otherside.

Chris Mannix just looks at the outdoors speeding by the little
window in the stagecoach door.

CHRIS
Phew doggie! That was a close one.
There were a few hours there I thought
I was a goner fe'r sure.

He lets out a LOUD REBEL YELL!

CHRIS

(CON'T)
Good god almighty, it's good to be alive!
Tell ya' what, Bob -

JOHN RUTH
- The names John.

CHRIS
- When we get to Red Rock, I'll buy you
and Major Marquis there dinner and drinks.
My way of sayin' thanks.

JOHN RUTH
I don't drink with rebel renegades,
and i damn sure don't break bread
with 'em.

CHRIS
Well Mr.Hangman, you sure don't sound
like a blue belly, but you sure do
talk like one. You gotta' axe to grind
against the cause.

JOHN RUTH
Yeah i do. I got me a big axe to grind
against a bunch of losers gone loco
wrappin' themselfs up in the rebel flag
as a excuse for killin' and stealin'.
(to Maj.Warren)
And this should interest you Warren,
imparticular emancipated blacks!

Maj.Warren looks over at Chris.
27.

DOMERGUE
Sounds like my kinda' fella’.

Chris says to John Ruth;

CHRIS
Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta’
newspapers printed in Washington D.C.
(beat)
Anywho......I'm just tryin' to let y'all
know how grateful I am. I was a goner,
and y'all saved me.

JOHN RUTH
You want to show me how grateful you
are......shut up.

CHRIS

I will. But before I shut up, there's
something I'd like to know?

(beat )
Why do they call ya', The Hangman?
That's a mighty mean moniker.
What's it mean?

lan Major Marquis Warren opens his mouth.

MAJ .WARREN
It's a name well earned. And unique
to our profession.

This gets everybody in the stagecoach's attention.

MAJ .WARREN

(CON'T)
when the handbill says Dead or Alive,
John Ruth always tries to bring 'em
back alive. That's why they call ‘em
The Hangman. When The Hangman catches
you, you don't die by a bullet in the
back. When The Hangman catches you...
++--you hang.

Then Maj.Warren turns to Domergue, and says;

MAJ .WARREN

(to Domergue)
Like for instance, if i were bringin'
you into Red Rock....you'd be up on that
roof with them other fella's .

Chris looks over at Maj.Warren.
2-7.

CHRIS
fae (meaning John
Ruth)
Does he know how famous you once was?

MAJ .WARREN
I don't think so.

John Ruth realizes he's being talked about.
Chris continues with his private conversation with Maj.Warren;

CHRIS

(to Maj.Warren)
Is there still a few stupid southern boys
out there who think there's a reward on
your head?

Maj-Warren knowing what Chris is referring to, says;

MAJ .WARREN
Not no more. I think i got the last of
‘em, two years ago.

CHRIS
Like they always say, you can always
a tell a southern boys...but you can't
tell 'em much.

That makes Maj.Warren, gafaw.

Chris turns his gaze on Domergue.

CHRIS
(to Domergue)
Do you know who he
(meaning Maj.Warren)

is?

DOMERGUE
Do I know about the thirty thousand
dollar reward on the head of Major
Marquis? Yeah, i know about Major Marquis
and his head.

John Ruth looks to Maj.Warren.
Chris explains to John Ruth;

CHRIS
For hillbilly's, the head of Major Marquis
was a new farm. Or a ranch. Or eight good
tr horses, the kind you could start a proper
stable with.
30.

CHRIS

(to maj-.Warren)
Them hillbilly's went nigger head huntin'
but they never did get ‘em the right
nigger head, did they?

MAJ .WARREN
No they didn't. But it wasn't for lack
of tryin'.

CHRIS
I bet.

(to John Ruth)
Now it didn't stay thirty thousand the
length of the war. It dropped down to
eight, then five.

(to Maj.Warren)
What was the reward at wars end?

MAJ .WARREN
At wars end? There was still a regiment
of Alabama veterans offering eight
hundred dollars.

CHRIS
You got some real committed old southern
fuckers in Alabama.

MAJ .WARREN
Oh they were committed, all right.
They was offering eight hundred real
dollars. Not that confederate wall paper.

CHRIS
But i bet even when it was five, you had
your share of southern boys comin' to cali.

MAJ .WARREN
You know i did.

(to John Ruth)
The confederates took exception to my
capacity for killin' them. So the cause
put a reward on my head.

(beat)
And them peckawoods left their families,
and left their homes, and came to this snowy
mountain, lookin' for me. And the ones
ain't no one heard tell of no more, them
the ones that found me.

JOHN RUTH
Why was there a reward on you?
31

MAJ .WARREN
After i broke out of Wellenbeck, the south
took my continued existence as a personal
affront.

JOHN RUTH
What's Wellenbeck?

CHRIS
You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck
prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?

JOHN RUTH

No Reb, I ain't never heard of it!
(to Maj.Warren)

You bust out?

Maj.Warren nods his head, yes.

CHRIS
Oh Maj.Marquis did more then bust out.
Maj-Marquis had a bright idea. So bright
you hafta' wonder why nobody never thought
about it before.

(to Maj.Warren)
Tell John Ruth your bright idea.

MAJ .WARREN
Well the whole damn place was just made
of kindling.

(beat )
So i burnt it down.

CHRIS
There was a rookie regiment spendin’
the overnight in the camp. Forty-seven
men...burnt to a crisp. Southern youth,
farmers sons, cream of the crop.

MAJ .WARREN
And i say, let 'em burn. I'm suppose to
apologize for killin' Johnny Reb? You
fought the war to keep niggers in chains.
I fought the war to kill white southern
crackers. Kill ‘em anyway i can. Shoot 'em,
burn ‘em, drown ‘em, drop big ole rocks
on their heads, whatever it takes to kill
white southern crackers, that's what i
joined the war to do....and that's what
i did.
Bz.

CHRIS

(to John Ruth)
To answer your question, John Ruth, when
Major Marquis burned forty seven men
alive, for no more a reason then to
give a nigger a run for the trees, that's
when the south put a reward on the head
of Major Marquis.

MAJ.WARREN

(to Chris)
And I made them trees, Mannix. And you
best believe i didn't look back neither.
Not till i passed the northern line.

CHRIS

(to Maj.Warren)
But you had a surprise waitin' for you
on the northern side, didn't ya'?

(to John Ruth)
See once they started pullin' out all
the burnt bodies at Wellenbeck. Seems
not all them boys were southern.

(to Maj.Warren)
Burnt up some of your own boys, didn't
ya' Major?

(to John Ruth)
They started findin' the burnt bodies
of prisoners.

(to Maj.Warren)
How many did they find?

MAJ .WARREN

(to John Ruth)
The fire got a little out of hand, he's
exaggerating.

CHRIS
Now if memory serves, your side didn't
look at it that way.
Not that i had the time to keep up with
yankee politics with all the lootin'
and shootin' me and mine suppose to have
done. Anyway Maj.Warren, what was the final
yankee death count?

JOHN RUTH

(to Chris)
Your dad was a bloody renegade. And he
commanded a renegade army of cutthroats.
CHRIS
What my daddy fought fer' was dignity
in defeat, and against the unconditional
surrender. We wern't foreign barbarians
at the gate. We were your brothers. We
deserved dignity in defeat.

MAJ .WARREN

(to Chris)
How many nigger towns you sack in your
fight for dignity in defeat, Mannix?

CHRIS

(to Maj.Warren)
My fair share, Major. When niggers are
scarred, that's when white folks are
safe. First order of business for a
renegade army fightin' for a lost
southern cause, make the white folks
feel safe.

MAJ .WARREN
Now you gonna' talk that hateful nigger
talk, you can ride up top with O.B.

CHRIS
No no no, you got me talkin' politics,
i didn't wanna'. Like i said, i'm just
happy to be alive. I think i'll just
look out this window here, at all this
pretty scenery, and just think about

how lucky i am.

 

Chris turns away from the Major, and looks out the window.

We see the white winter wonderland landscape of trees and rocks
and snow banks go rolling by in GLORIOUS 70mm SUPERSCOPE.

0.B. driving the six horse carriage forward. He takes his fist and
BANGS on the side of the stagecoach.

INT - STAGECOACH (MOVING) - DAY
Except for John Ruth, the other passengers have dozed off.
That pounding was 0.B.'s cue that Minnie's was just ahead.

JOHN RUTH
Okay everybody, wake up. We're at Minnie's.

The other three passengers open their eyes and return to life.

JOHN RUTH
Now this storms lookin' pretty ugly.
So once we get here, whoever Minnie's
got working for her, is going to need
help unhitching these ponies and gettin'
them in shelter. Now since I can't likely
do that chained to her, I'm volunteering
you two freeloaders.

a Neither Maj.Warren or Chris have a problem with that.

CHRIS
Sure.
(beat)
How long we been asleep?

JOHN RUTH
About a half hour.

CHRIS
I don't know if it's my imagination,
but it seems a lot colder then a half
hour ago.

JOHN RUTH
It ain't your imagination. I for one
can't wait to partake of some of Minnie's
coffy.

{to Maj.Warren)
What's that she always says about it?

MAJ .WARREN
About her coffy?

ron John Ruth nods his head in the affirmative.
35.

MAJ .WARREN
That it's Strong, Hot, and Good.

John Ruth laughs;

JOHN RUTH
That's it. Strong, Hot, and Good.

EXT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY

The six horse team stagecoach pulls up to the front of the log
built building that's known as "MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY".

On the outside, Minnie's just looked like a slightly bigger then
normal stagecoach stop over, parked halfway up a mountain. That's
because, despite local reputation, that's what it is. If serving
two bottles of tequila, one bottle of Mezcal, and one bottle of
brandy qualifies you as a bar, it's a bar. If serving stew
qualifies you as restaurant, it's a restaurant.

It sells a few hats, and gloves, and snow shoes for the stagecoach
passengers. And supplies for the mountain folk. And it received
special packages for people in Red Rock. Like say when Carlos
Robante (Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez) in "Rio Bravo" buys those red
bloomers for his wife Consuela (Estelita Rodriguez), but doesn't
want everybody in town to know about it. If he lived in Red Rock,
he'd buy them through the mail, have them sent to Minnie's, and
when they arrived, Minnie would get word to him, and he'd ride out
there and pick them up. Minnie's was also a good place to hold up
during a storm. This wasn't the first time a group of passengers
from the stage had to sit out the snow. Minnie and her partner
Sweet Dave also traded goods. In fact the only stuff in their
store of any interest is the stuff they acquired in trade. If that
makes them a trading goods store, then their a trading goods
store.

Minnie's Haberdashery is a lot of things, but the one thing
it wasn't, was a haberdashery.

0.B. brings the horses to a stop. He sees something.....
ANOTHER STAGECOACH, horses put away, off to the side.

OB.'s first thought is, there's already people here. His second
thought is, that's strange.

He looks around.

The storm has gotten uglier....the wind more brutal.

He see's the outside of Minnie's, he looks at the barn, the
outhouse. The field of white snow surrounding it. It looks like

Minnie's, but it looks a little spooky. But this storm is spooky,
so O.B. caulks up his feelings to that.
36.

And into this spooky storm A BEARDED MAN in a big winter coat

and hat comes out of Minnie's front door, and walks towards the
stagecoach. Just as he gets closer the passengers inside open the
shades on the windows of the carriage door. The Man sees it's four
passengers sitting inside.

This seems to startle him.

He shoots off to speak with 0.B.

INT - STAGECOACH (STILL) - DAY
All four passengers saw the Man's reaction.

CHRIS
He didn't look that happy to see us.

John Ruth, staring at Minnie's building, says;

JOHN RUTH
I think he's already got ‘em some
customers.

EXT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY

The bearded man in the winter coat moves over to 0.B.'s perch on
the wagon.

BEARDED MAN

(speaking with

French accent)
What the hells going on, we weren't
expecting another stage tonight?

Referring to the other stagecoach.

o.B.
I can see. you already got another one
up here.

BEARDED MAN
I just got through putting the horses
away.

The storm is really getting going now. So much so people have to
yell to be heard.

o.B.
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like your stuck with us.
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?
2?.

BEARDED MAN
They ain't here. I'm running the place
while their gone.

John Ruth steps out of the stagecoach into the cold dragging
Domergue along with him.

JOHN RUTH
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

O.B.
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.

JOHN RUTH

(to 0.B.)
They ain't here...

(to Bearded Man)
...where are they?

BEARDED MAN
Their visiting Minnie's mother.

JOHN RUTH
Her mother? Who are you?

BEARDED MAN
I'm Bob.

JOHN RUTH
Your what?

BOB
I'm Bob.

JOHN RUTH
Bob?

BOB
Oui...Bob.

JOHN RUTH
What are you?

BOB
I'm French.

JOHN RUTH
So your lookin' after the place while
Minnie's away?

BOB
Oui.
38.

JOHN RUTH
Coffy in there?
BOB
Oui.
JOHN RUTH
Is it Strong, Hot, and Good?
BOB
Oui.
JOHN RUTH

Well whoever you are, help 0O.B. with

the horses. Get 'em outta' this cold,

before the blizzard lands on our heads.
BOB

I just put those other horses away.

You need it done fast, you need to help.

JOHN RUTH
I got two of my best men on it.

He says as both Maj.Warren and Chris Mannix climb out of the
stagecoach.

John Ruth YANKS Domergue away towards the front door of Minnie's,
when suddenly his arm is YANKED BACK.

He looks down and sees Domergue has stopped and squatted in the
snow to take a pee.

She looks up at him.

DOMERGUE
You'd let a horse piss, wouldn't ya'?

Okay, maybe she's got a point. He lets Domergue take her pee.

INT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY

We focus in on the front door of Minnie's Haberdashery, and only
the front door.

We hear John Ruth outside, trying to open the door, but it's
nailed shut.

Then we hear PEOPLE INSIDE THE ROOM YELL OFF SCREEN at the door;

PEOPLE INSIDE (0S)
Kick it open! :
37.

John Ruth KICKS THE FRONT DOOR OPEN - The WIND from outside WHIPS
INTO THE ROOM - John Ruth and Domergue step quickly inside, Ruth
SLAMS the door SHUT behind him - CUTTING OFF THE WIND - only to
see there's no door lock.

The People Inside yell at them;

PEOPLE INSIDE(0S)
You have to nail it shut!

Both him and her look at them,"What"?

PEOPLE INSIDE(0S)
There's a hammer and nails by the door!

As they hold the door closed, they look down and see a hammer and
a can of nails.

So as Domergue holds the wind battered door closed, John Ruth picks
up the hammer, grabs some nails, and begins POUNDING THEM into a
piece of wood on the door. He finishes and starts to put the hammer
down, when the People Inside yell at him;

PEOPLE INSIDE(0S)
You need to do two piece's of wood!

Both him and Domergue give them a bit of "a look", but then turn
back to the door. He picks off the floor another piece of wood,
and HAMMERS it into the door and the wall.

When he finishes, he lays down the hammer, and says;

JOHN RUTH
That doors a son of a gun. Who's the
idiot who broke that?

He turns to look at the People Inside.
It's THREE MEN:

One, a BLONDE LITTLE MAN who wears a grey european cut business
suit who stands up when he sees a woman has entered the room.

BLONDE LITTLE MAN

(speaking with

a English accent)
Good heavens, a woman out in this white
hell. You must be frozen solid.

The Blonde Little Man is a bit of a Fop. Not a gigantic Fop, just
a bit of one.
Two, a OLD MAN with a white beard in a 01d grey Confederate

Officer Uniform. Rank, GENERAL. He sits by himself in a cozy chair

by the fire place complete with roaring fire. He doesn't look up
f= at the man and woman.

and...

Three, a lone COWBOY FELLA', in a cow puncher uniform complete
with cool brown cow puncher hat. He sits at a little table in the
corner, peeling a apple with a little tiny knife, the apple skin
hanging down unbroken in a long string. When the Man and Woman
enter the room, he doesn't stop what he's doing (peeling the
apple), but his eyes go up to them.

We also take in the inside of Minnie's Haberdashery. As has been
reported by Bob, sadly no Minnie. Even without meeting Minnie, we
feel her loss to this building. With Minnie's big presence this
place comes alive and is homey and warm. Without her, it's a cold
shack full of junk.

There's a kitchen area, that includes a pot belly stove.

Two comfy chairs sit in front of fireplace with a big warming fire
crackling in it. In one of the cozy chairs sits the 01d General, in
the other was the Little English Man before he stood up.

Across from the kitchen area, on the otherside of the room, is a

Bar Area. A Small Bar, with Three Bar Stools. And Four Bottles of
Booze. Two bottles of Tequila. One bottle of mezcal. One bottle of

rn Brandy.

A few scattered small tables for one to four. The Cowboy Fella'
sits at one of those.

A Picnic Table in the middle of the room for community eating.
A 01d Piano in the corner.

And A Big Iron Double Bed that sits amongst the goods in the
store. It's Minnie and Sweet Daves bed.

John Ruth answers the English Man;
JOHN RUTH
Got a few dead ones back there frozen
solid. This tramps just chilly.

ENGLISH MAN
Well she should warm herself by the fire.

JOHN RUTH
Coffy i'11 do her good.

Ruth YANKS her in the direction of the pot belly stove and the

os coffy.
Ui.

The People Inside see the handcuffs that attache the two.

As John Ruth crosses the room heading towards the kitchen area,

f™ dragging Domergue along like a rag doll, he asks the English Man;

JOHN RUTH
Seems like Minnie's got ‘er a full house.
When did you fella's arrive?

ENGLISH MAN
About forty minutes ago.

JOHN RUTH

(meaning the

Cowboy Fella’)
Is that your driver?

John Ruth finds the coffy pot’on the stove.

ENGLISH MAN
No, he's a passenger. The driver lit
out. He said he was going to spend the
blizzard shacked up with a friend.
He'd come back when the sun came out.

JOHN RUTH
Lucky devil.

vant John Ruth goes looking for coffy cups. He sees a half plucked

chicken, makes a face at it. He finds a coffy cup, and pours
himself a hot cup of Minnie's coffy.

He turns to Domergue and asks;

JOHN RUTH
What was it again?

DOMERGUE
About her coffy?

JOHN RUTH
Yeah.

DOMERGUE

Strong hot and good.
JOHN RUTH
That's it, Strong, Hot, and .....
John Ruth takes a DRINK of coffy....Then SPITS IT OUT...

JOHN RUTH
Jesus Christ, that's awful!
yz.

la The Cowboy Fella' laughs.
As does the Little Man.
As does Domergue.

As does John Ruth as he takes the coffy pot and dumps out the
brown junk in it.

JOHN RUTH
Christ almighty, what that French fella'
do, soak his ole socks in the pot?

They all laugh.

LITTLE MAN
I think we felt the same way, but were
alittle too polite to say something.

DOMERGUE
(referring to
Ruth)

He don't have that problem.

JOHN RUTH
Where's the coffy?

The Little Man points at a bag.

LITTLE MAN
There.

John Ruth makes a new pot of coffy, dragging Domergue with him. As
he prepares the coffy, he asks the Little English Man;

JOHN RUTH
So all three of you on the way to Red
Rock when the blizzard stopped ya',
huh?

LITTLE MAN
Yes, all three of us were on that
stagecoach out there. How many in yours?

JOHN RUTH
Full house. Including me, her and the
driver, five.

The Cowboy Fella's eyes raise as he hears the stagecoach brought
five with them. He eats a piece of apple.

The Old General doesn't twitch.
43.

oN

The Little English Man's eyes raise as well.
LITTLE MAN
Five? Well well well. Looks like Minnie's
Haberdashery is about to get cozy the
next couple of days.

JOHN RUTH
Where's the well water?

The Little English Man points at a bucket.

LITTLE MAN
Right there.

John Ruth adds water to the coffy pot and puts it on the pot belly
stove to boil.

Then suddenly Domergue blurts out to The Little Man or the room;
DOMERGUE
The new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling
with us.

All three, English Man, Old Man, and Cowboy Fella', hear that.

JOHN RUTH
Sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.
LITTLE MAN
(curious)
The new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling
with you?
JOHN RUTH

He's lien, he ain't sheriff of nothin'.
He's a southern renegade. He's just
talkin' his self outta’ freezin' to
death, is all.

(to Domergue)
What the fuck i tell you ‘bout talkin'?
I will bust you in the mouth right in
front of all these people, I don't give
a fuck!

The Little English Man watches the terse exchange between the man
and woman with a visible amount of distaste.

LITTLE MAN

You never said your name, sir.
JOHN RUTH

John Ruth.
YY,

(am LITTLE MAN
. Are you a lawman?

JOHN RUTH
I'm takin' her to the law.

LITTLE MAN
So your a bounty hunter?

JOHN RUTH
That's right, Buster.

LITTLE MAN
Do you have a warrant?

John Ruth is surprised by that question.

JOHN RUTH
‘Corse i do.
LITTLE MAN
May I see it?
JOHN RUTH
Why?
a LITTLE MAN

Your suppose to produce it upon request.
How am I suppose to know your not a
villain, kidnaping this woman without a
warrant in your possession

JOHN RUTH

(irritated)
What's your name, Buster?

LITTLE MAN
Well it certainly isn't Buster.
It's Oswaldo Mobray.

JOHN RUTH
Oswaldo?

OSWALDO
Yes.

JOHN RUTH

Well i got my warrant, Oswaldo.

John Ruth takes the warrant out of his winter coat, and SLAPS it
into Oswaldo's hand.

co
tbe.

Oswaldo removes a glasses case from his suit coat pocket. Out of
the case he removes a pair of reading glasses, and places them on
his face. He examines the document.

He looks up from the paper to the face of Daisy Domergue.

OSWALDO
I take it your Daisy Domergue?

Domergue starts to say, yes - when John Ruth interrupts her.

JOHN RUTH
- It's her.

Oswaldo goes back to examining the warrant.

OSWALDO
(as he reads)
This warrant says, Dead or Alive?

JOHN RUTH
Yes it does.

OSWALDO
You've been transporting her for days,
haven't you?

JOHN RUTH
How do you know?

OSWALDO
Because you both look like it.

(he hands Ruth

back the warrant)
Transporting a desperate hostile prisoner
like her sounds like hard work.
Wouldn't transporting her be easier if
she were dead?

As John Ruth puts the warrant back in the pocket of his winter
coat.

JOHN RUTH
No one said the job was suppose to be
easy.

OSWALDO
Why is her hanging proper, so important
to you?

JOHN RUTH
Let's just say i don't like to cheat the
hangman. He's gotta’ make a living too.

Oswaldo Mobray reaches into the pocket of his suit vest, and
, produces a BUSINESS CARD, which he extends to John Ruth.

OSWALDO
I appreciate that. Allow me to properly
introduce myself. I'm Oswaldo Mobray,
the hangman in these parts.

John Ruth looks at the card.
JOHN RUTH
Well la-dee-da.
(looks at

Oswaldo)
Looks like i brought you a customer.

Oswaldo looks to Daisy.
Daisy looks to Oswaldo.

OSWALDO
So it would appear.

 
 
    
 

DOMERGUE
Have you ever spent two days or more
locked up with one of your customers
before hand?

EXT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY

and
INT - MINNIE'S STABLE
We see separate shots of Maj.Warren, Chris, 0.B., and Bob
unhitching the horses from the stagecoach....Leading them across
the snowy ground to,stable....and once in the stable leading them
into the stall. tre

All FOUR MEN : MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN. CHRIS MANNIX. O.B..BOB.
Know how to handle horses.

We also see THE WIND get WORSE.

INT - MINNIE'S HABADASHERY - DAY

John Ruth, with Domergue in tow, has relocated with Oswaldo Mobray
by the bar. John Ruth pours shots of mezcal into clay shooters for
Oswaldo, himself, and Domergue.

They drink.

As the clay shooter leaves John Ruth's lips, he looks across the
room at The Cowboy Fella' .

The Cowboy Fella' is at his table, a deck of cards laid out in
front of him, playing a game of SOLITAIRE.

A BOTTLE of BRANDY and a GLASS sit on the table.
As does a pile of SHELLED PEANUTS, and a PILE OF BROKEN SHELLS.

The Cowboy Fella' minds his own business, drinking BRANDY, eating
PEANUTS, and playing SOLITAIRE.

John Ruth turns to Oswaldo at the bar;

JOHN RUTH
How "bout the cowboy fella'? What's his
story?

OSWALDO

I don't know, he doesn't say much.

JOHN RUTH
What'd ya’ mean, he doesn't say much?
You rode up that whole hill together
didn't ya'?

OSWALDO
And he didn't say much.
Wg.

JOHN RUTH
'
ao What's his name?

OSWALDO
I don't know.

JOHN RUTH
He never said his name?

JOHN RUTH
I don't think so.

John Ruth digs a SILVER DOLLAR out of his pocket. With his thumb,
he FLIPS IT THROUGH THE AIR, landing on The Cowboy Fella's
solitaire table with a LOUD THUMP.

The Cowboy Fella' looks up from his game.

John Ruth, dragging along Domergue, heads towards the Cowboy
Fella's table.

JOHN RUTH
No offense cowboy fella', just gettin’
your attention.

The Cowboy Fella' leans back in his chair and looking up at the
bounty hunter, says his first lines;

COWBOY FELLA'
You got it.

JOHN RUTH
I'm John Ruth, I'm bringin' in this one
(gesturing to
Domergue)
to Red Rock to hang. That's my story.
What's yours?

The Cowboy Fella' shows the bounty hunter he's a real wise ass.

COWBOY FELLA'
Actually...it was my brother Earl,
Who was the storyteller in the family.
Me, I've never been very good at it.
It's a gift. Some folks have it, some
folks don't.

John Ruth looks down at him sitting at the table with a smile on
his face.

JOHN RUTH
Smarty pants, huh?
44.

Ruth turns to Domergue, and points at the solitaire table.

JOHN RUTH
Turn that over.

Domergue, doing what she's told, TURNS OVER the cowboy fella's
table. Cards, a brandy bottle, and peanuts go flying.

John Ruth steps in to the sitting man closer, and he places his
hand on the butt of his pistol.

COWBOY FELLA
You do realize you broke our only
bottle of brandy?

JOHN RUTH
Where your goin' you won't need brandy.
(beat)
Look boy, smarty pants answers ain't
gonna' cut it. I'm transporting a
prisoner. A prisoner who has friends.
Friends who'd like to see her free, and
me dead. Ain't no way i'm spendin' a
coupla' nights under a roof with somebody
i don't know who they are. And I don't
know who you are. So who are you?

COWBOY FELLA’
Joe Gage.

JOHN RUTH
What?

JOE GAGE
That's my name. Joe Gage.

JOHN RUTH
Okay Joe Gage, why you goin' to Red Rock?

JOE GAGE
I ain't goin' to Red Rock.

JOHN RUTH
Where you goin"?

JOE GAGE
I'm goin' nine miles outside of Red Rock.

JOHN RUTH
What's there?

JOE GAGE
My mother.
Fe.

JOHN RUTH
Your mother?

JOE GAGE
I'm a cow puncher. I just finished a
big long drive. I wasn't just a ass in
a saddle,/ether. I was partners on this
one. For’once in my life I made a pretty
penny. I was coming up here to spend
Christmas with my mother.

JOHN RUTH
Really?

JOE GAGE
Really.

JOHN RUTH

Funny, you don't really look like the
coming home for Christmas type.

: JOE GAGE
Well then looks are deceiving. Because
I'm defiantly the coming home for Christmas
to spend it with my mother, type.
Christmas with mother? It's the greatest
thing in the world.

(beat )
Is that good enough?

JOHN RUTH

That's good enough for now.
(beat)

Steer clear of my prisoner.

He moves away from Joe Gage, and looks at the Old General.
He just looks at the Old Man who doesn't look at him.

John Ruth makes contact.

JOHN RUTH
(CON'T)
Hello old timer.

The old timer points out the General rank on his uniform.

OLD GENERAL
General.

JOHN RUTH
(respectfully)
General.
51.

OLD GENERAL
You sir, are a hyena.

Domergue laughs at this.
OLD GENERAL
(CON'T)
And I have no wish to speak to you.
John Ruth takes the insult for a moment and says;
JOHN RUTH

I've been called worse. Fair enough,
General, sorry to bother you.

INT - MINNIE'S STABLE - DAY
The four men get all the horses in the stable stalls. With the
other stage's six horses, and Minnie and Sweet Daves nag, it's
quite a full house at Minnie's stable. 7
Thirteen Horses.
Not such a great number.
As they finish, Bob the Frenchman says to the other three;
BOB
I'll feed and water the horses. You go

inside, and get some hot coffy. I've got
some stew on the fire, should be ready

soon.
O.B.

Sounds good to me.
(to Bob)

Look no matter how bad this blizzard
gets, we still gotta' feed these horses.
So me and Chris better lay out a line
from the stable to Minnie's front door.

BOB
Good idea.

O.B. and Chris grab a rope, a hammer, spikes and start in on that.
Maj.Warren tells Bob;

MAJ .WARREN
I'll help you.

BOB
No, don't worry, go inside, get warm.
g2.

MAJ .WARREN
Your doing stable work in a blizzard,
i offer to help, and you say, no?

BOB
Your right. Thank you for your help.

the two men get to the business of feeding and watering the hard
working horses.

EXT - MINNIE'S STABLE - DAY

Chris and 0.B. stretch out a rope in the harsh snow and wind.

INT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY

John Ruth and Domergue sit at the bar drinking with the hangman
Oswaldo Mobray.

Oswaldo is in mid-monologue;

OSWALDO

(to Domergue)
Your wanted for murder. For the shake
of my analogy, let's assume you did it.

John Ruth SNORTS.

Her eyeballs go to John Ruth for a beat, then move back to
Oswaldo.

DOMERGUE
So....assuming that....?

OSWALDO
John Ruth wants to take you to Red Rock
to stand trail for murder. And...IF....
your found guilty, the people of Red
Rock will hang you in the town square.
And as the hangman, I will preform the
execution. And if all those things end
up taking place, that's what civilized
society calls JUSTICE.

(beat)
However if the relatives and loved ones
of the person you murdered were outside
that door right now. And after busting
down that door, they drug you out in the
snow, and strung you up by the neck....
+...that would be FRONTIER JUSTICE.
53.

OSWALDO

(CON'T)
Now the good part about frontier Justice
is it's very thirst quenching. The bad
part is it's apt to be Wrong as Right.

JOHN RUTH

(to Domergue)
Not in your case. In your case, you'd
have it comin' . But other people, maybe
not so much.

OSWALDO
But ultimately...what's the real
difference between the two? The real
difference is ME....The Hangman.
To me, it doesn't matter what you did.
When i hang you, i will get no
satisfaction from your death. It's my
job. I hang you in Red Rock, i go to
the next town, i hang somebody else there.
The man who pulls the lever that breaks
your neck, will be a dispassionate man.
And that dispassion is the very essence
of justice. For justice delivered
WITHOUT dispassion, is always in danger
of not being justice.

Then we hear Chris and 0.B. outside the front door.

EXT - FRONT DOOR MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY
Chris tries the door it won't open.

then he hears The People Inside YELL from the otherside of the
door;

PEOPLE INSIDE(0S)
Kick it open!

Chris and 0.B. trade looks.

INT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY

Chris Mannix KICKS THE FRONT DOOR OPEN - The WIND from outside
WHIPS INTO THE ROOM - Chris Mannix and 0.B. step quickly inside,
Mannix SLAMS the DOOR SHUT behind him - CUTTING OFF THE WIND -
Only to see there's no door lock.

PEOPLE INSIDE
You hafta' nail it shut!
SY.

So as Chris holds the door closed as the wind beats against it,

O.B. picks up the hammer, grabs some nails, and begins POUNDING

THEM into a piece of wood on the door. He finishes and starts to
put the hammer down, when the people Inside yell at him;

PEOPLE INSIDE
You need to do two piece's of wood!

Both O.B. and Chris give them a bit of a "look", but then turn
back to the door, and POUND NAILS into another piece of wood.

When 0.B. finishes, he lays the hammer down and says;

O.B.
Jesus Christ, that doors a whore!

Chris turns around and takes in the room and the people.

CHRIS
Oh, i get it, haberdashery, that was a joke.

He see's John Ruth at the bar, and on the otherside of the room,
the pot belly stove with the pot of coffy on it.

The very cold Chris and 0.B. head for the coffy pot.
CHRIS
{to John Ruth)
Hows the coffy?

Moving over to the pot belly stove, and where he goes so goes
Domergue, John Ruth says;

JOHN RUTH
Now, pretty good, if i do say so
myself.
0.B finds the cups.
Chris pours the coffy.
John Ruth and Domergue join them.
As does Oswaldo Mobray.
Chris and 0.B. drink the coffy.
They both really like it.

O.B.
Damn that's good.
Talking to Chris and 0.B. John Ruth jerks his thumb in Oswaldo's
direction;

JOHN RUTH
Guess who he is?

Chris takes a drink of coffy and guesses;

CHRIS
Buffalo Bill?

The little english fop laughs at that;

OSWALDO
Ha ha ha - hardly. I'm Oswaldo Mobray,
I'm The -
John Ruth interrupts him.
JOHN RUTH

- He's the hangman of Red Rock.
Both Chris and 0.B.'s eyes raise.

CHRIS
Oh, you are?

Oswaldo smiles at him.

OSWALDO
Yes I am.

Chris offers his hand to shake, they do.
CHRIS
Well good to meet you Mr.Mobray, I'm
Chris Mannix the new sheriff in Red Rock.
Both Joe Gage and The 01d General look up to see who's talking.
John Ruth, chained to Domergue, drinking Mezcal, says;
JOHN RUTH
(loudly)
Horseshit!

Mr.Mannix and Mr.Mobray finish shaking hands, they both look to
rude Ruth.

CHRIS
Pay no attention to him.
 

wn"

John Ruth continues with his boorish behavior;

JOHN RUTH

(loudly)
HORSE-SHIT!

(to Chris)
If your a goddamn sheriff, I'ma
monkey's uncle.

CHRIS

(to Ruth)
Good, then you can share bananas with
your nigger friend in the stable.

Chris continues with the introductions, despite John Ruth;
CHRIS
(to Oswaldo)
Fella' next to me is a hellva' driver
named O.B.

Oswaldo and O.B shake hands.

JOHN RUTH
That's the only thing you said that's
the truth.
Chris ignores him.
CHRIS

(to Oswaldo)
You comin' into Red Rock to hang Lance
Lawson?

OSWALDO
Precisely.

CHRIS
Do you have your execution orders on you?

OSWALDO
In my bag.

CHRIS
Can i see them?

OSWALDO
Of course.

John Ruth and Domergue just watched the following exchange
somewhat flabbergasted. Even John Ruth would have to admit, if
Chris is lying....he sure is a convincing liar.
67.

Oswaldo goes over to the BAG he left by the cozy chair by the
fireplace, next to The 01d General. He opens it searching for the

papers.

John Ruth asks Chris;

JOHN RUTH
Who's Lance Lawson?

CHRIS
He's a fella’ been sittin' in the Red
Rock jail about a month now. He's the
fella' - who shot the fella'- who was
sheriff ‘fore me.

Chris moves over by the fire, and takes the papers that Oswaldo

hands to him.

He reads them.

Everybody in the room watches him read the papers.

As he reads, Oswaldo asks him;

OSWALDO
What did you mean when you said, the
bounty hunters nigger friend in the
stable?

CHRIS

(still reading)
He's got a nigger bounty hunter friend
in the stable.

OSWALDO
All that just to guard her?

Finishing with the papers;

CHRIS
I don't think that was the original
idea, but that's the idea now.

He hand Oswaldo back his papers.

OSWALDO
I didn't know they had nigger bounty
hunters in America?

CHRIS
We ain't got many. But the one we got
are peppers.
5g.

After handing the hangman's papers back to him, he gets a good

(™ look at The Old Southern General sitting in one of the two cozy

chairs in the room.

CHRIS
Well cut my legs off and call me shorty,
is that Gen.Sanford Smithers in my line
of sight?

The Old General looks up at the young man and smiles;

OLD GENERAL
You've a good eye son.

Chris lets out a laugh and a twirl;

CHRIS
I'll be double dogged dammed!
General Sandy "Don't give a damn"
Smithers!

Chris salutes the Old General.
CHRIS

(CON'T)
Cap't.Chris Mannix, Mannix Marauders.

Gen.Smithers returns the salute.

GEN. SMITHERS
Erskine's boy?

CHRIS
Yes sir.

Gen.Smithers points to the empty cozy chair, covered by a blanket
and some animal skins.

GEN. SMITHERS
Sit down, Cap't.

CHRIS
Yes sir.

Chris sits down across from the old General.

CHRIS

(CON'T)
Boy did my daddy talk about you.
I heard you pulverized them blue bellies!
Ones you didn't kill, ran off screamin'
in terror!
[7 GEN. SMITHERS
Me and my boys did our part. As did

~ Erskine and his boys. I never knew your
father son, but i respected his resolve.

CHRIS
Gen.Sandy Smithers. It's a small damn
world.
John Ruth, who has moved back by the bar, says to Domergue;
JOHN RUTH
I don't know about the world. But this
goddamn mountain sure seems pretty
fuckin' small.

MAJ.WARREN
Her mother? I didn't know Minnie had a
mother.

BOB
Everybody's got a mother.
MAJ.WARREN
I suppose. And they left you in charge?
BOB
Yes.
MAJ.WARREN

That sure don't sound like Minnie.

BOB
Are you callin' me a liar?

MAJ.WARREN
Not yet i ain't. But it sure do sound
peculiar.

BOB
What sounds peculiar?

MAJ.WARREN
Well for one, Minnie just never struck
me as the sentimental type. An two, I
can't imagine Sweet Dave liftin' his fat
ass outta’ his chair long enough to
fetch well water, unless Minnie was
layin' a fryin' pan upside his head.
No less takin' trips to the north side.

BOB
That sounds a whole lot like your calling
me a liar, Mister Black.

MAJ .WARREN
It does sound a whole lot like it. But i
still haven't done it yet. Minnie still
serve food?

BOB
Do you consider stew food?
Gl.

MAJ .WARREN
Yes.

BOB
Then we serve food.

MAJ .WARREN
Minnie still stink up the place with
her "Old Quail" pipe tobacco?

BOB
Minnie don't smoke a pipe. She rolls
her own."Red Apple" tobacco. But Mister
Black...I think you already know this.

MAJ.WARREN
Just seein' if you do.

The stand off is over. They both head for Minnie's.

INT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY

Chris stands at the pot belly stove pouring two cups of coffy from
the coffy pot. One for him, and one for Gen.Smithers, who he talks
to as he pours.

CHRIS
So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir?

The Southern General has not moved from his chair.

GEN. SMITHERS
My boy.

CHRIS
You gotta’ boy lives in Red Rock?

Chris comes back carrying two cups of coffy.
He places one on the table next to the General.
And he sips the other as he sits back down in the cozy chair.
GEN. SMITHERS
My son, Chester Charles Smithers, died

out here a few years back.

CHRIS
Forgive me sir.

GEN. SMITHERS
No forgiveness needed. Like i said, it
was a few years back.
62.

Chris moves over

GEN.SMITHERS

(CON'T)
It was after his service was served.
He took off for the hills of Wyoming to
make his fortune. Never to be heard from
again. I've bought him a symbolic plot
in the Red Rock cemetery. I'm here to
instruct the stone maker of the
headstone.

CHRIS
Is he a goner fer' sure? No chance he
could be livin' "the cold life" out in
the woods. It's a rough life. But folks
can learn it.

GEN. SMITHERS
If he did what he came to do, he'd a
come home.

CHRIS
Where's home?

GEN. SMITHERS
Georgia.

CHRIS

Well what say we have a drink to Chester
Charles Smithers? A drink to your service
to the south, sir. And a drink to the
great state of Georgia.

GEN. SMITHERS
I'd like a drink from Erskine Mannix's
boy to my boy. But I won't drink with
that flesh peddler at the bar. That
fella' is a bully and a hyena.

CHRIS
I couldn't agree more. That fella' is a
bully and a hyena. But luckily, I speak
hyena. Let me have a word with him.

to John Ruth and Domergue at the bar.

CHRIS

{to John)
Mr.Ruth would you mind if myself and the
General commandeered the bar for a little
Southern war remembrance?

JOHN RUTH
Sure, why not.
63.

ro

Chris goes back to get the southern General. At first the old man
doesn't want to leave his seat, and seems nervous, but Chris wont
take no for a answer.

Now Gen.Smithers and Chris have traded places with John Ruth and
Domergue. With the two southerners at the bar, and John Ruth
sitting in Gen.Smithers cozy chair. Domergue sits on the floor
next to John Ruth.

Chris pours two shots of tequila into clay cups for him and the
old man. Then holding his cup high, Chris toasts;

CHRIS
This a drink to Chester Charles Smithers.
This is a drink to one man's commitment
to a cause.

(he puts his

hand on the

General's shoulder)
And this is a drink to the red in
Georgia clay.

The southern Gen.and Cap't. drink down the tequila.

As John Ruth sits by the fire, he notices something in the
fireplace. He asks Domergue who's closer;

JOHN RUTH
Hey girl, see those pages in the
fireplace?

DOMERGUE
Yeah.

JOHN RUTH
Grab 'em for me?

She does, and hands him what looks like the half burned pages from
a novel.

He examines them in his hand.

WE SEE THE BURNT PAGES
And notice the name of one of the characters...."D'ARTAGNAN"

THEN.....

BOB KICKS OPEN THE FRONT DOOR - The WIND from outside WHIPS INTO
THE ROOM - Bob and Maj.Warren step quickly inside, Bob SLAMS the
DOOR SHUT behind him - CUTTING OFF THE WIND - Bob says to The
Major;
BOB
You have to hold it closed, while i nail
it shut.

Maj.Warren looks at him, really?

Bob grabs the hammer and wastes no time POUNDING the nails into
both pieces of wood.

They finnish, and turn from the door, with Maj.Warren getting his
first look at the room and it's people.

He sees:

General Smithers from behind at the bar with Chris.
Joe Gage sitting at a table.

Oswaldo Mobray sitting by the fire in the seat opposite
John Ruth.

Maj.Warren see's 0.B. over by the pot belly stove drinking coffy.
He heads over to him.

MAJ .WARREN
Looky here 0.B., I gotta' proposition
for ya'. At first you asked for two
hundred and fifty dollars when we get to
Red Rock.
Well I think your driving this wagon so
godddamn fuckin' great, that when we get
to Red Rock I'm gonna give you two hundred
and fifty dollars just for driving this
wagon so goddamn fuckin’ great. And I'm
gonna keep my other hundred and fifty
dollar deal with the drinks and booze
and friendly ladies....with ANOTHER
hundred on top of THAT....if....you help
me take them two fella's down from off
the roof and stash them in the snow.
And when the snow melts, help me tie
‘em back on.

O.B.
Jesus smoke, I just got warm.

MAJ .WARREN
I know. I know. But you and I both know
it's gonna' get colder out there. And
you and i both know now's the time.

Maj.Warren holds out his hand to shake.

MAJ .WARREN
We gotta' deal.

O.B.
Deal.

He shakes hands with the black man. Then starts putting on his
winter coat.

AT THE BAR
Gen.Smithers looks at the black man with bitterness.

Chris Mannix notices it.

CHRIS
You know that nigger, sir?

GEN. SMITHERS
I don't know that nigger. I know he's
a nigger. That's all i need to know.

Chris laughs to himself.

CHRIS
Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.
That nigger is -

Just as Chris Mannix was going to name Major Marquis Warren to the
old man, Major Marquis Warren YELLS out across the room;

MAJ.WARREN
General Sanford Smithers?
Battle of Baton Rouge?

This gets everybodies attention.
Everybody turns to Maj.Warren.

Everybody that is except the old southern general, who sits at the
bar, back to the black man.

The Southern Old Man, tells the Southern Young Man (Chris);

GEN.SMITHERS

(to Chris)
Inform this nigger in the Calvary uniform,
I had a division of confederates under
my command in Baton Rouge.
66.

CHRIS
rant (to Maj.Warren)
Major Nigger? General Smithers wishes me
to inform you -

MAJ.WARREN
(to Chris)
- I heard ‘em hillbilly.

Major Warren starts slowly crossing the room towards the Old Man,
hot cup of coffy in his hand.

MAJ .WARREN

(to Chris)
Inform this old cracker I was in
Baton Rouge as well.

(beat)
On the other side.

CHRIS
Oh that's interesting.

(to the General)
General Smithers, he said -

GEN.SMITHERS
(to Chris)
Cap't Mannix, inform this nigger I don't
~~ acknowledge the uniforms of northern
niggers.
MAJ.WARREN

(to Gen.Smithers)
You captured a whole colored command
that day. But no colored troopers ever
made it to a camp, did they?

Maj.Warren accusing stance prompts the Old Man to turn around and
face his accuser. But he doesn't stand up from the bar stool.

The whole room watches.

GEN. SMITHERS

(to Maj.Warren)
We had neither the time, the food, or
the inclination to care for northern
horses or northern niggers.

(beat)
So we shot them where they stood.

Maj.Warren throws his cup of coffy away, and his hand goes to his
gun butt.

WHEN...

o™
C7.

Oswaldo Mobray steps into the line of fire between the old white
aaa man and the black man.

OSWALDO
Gentlemen, I know Americans aren't apt
to let a little thing like a unconditional
surrender get in the way of a good war.
But i strongly suggest we don't restage
The Battle of Baton Rouge in a blizzard
in Minnie's Haberdashery.

(breath)
Now Maj.Warren, while i realize passions
are high, that was awhile ago.
And if you shoot this unarmed old man,
I guarantee you, I will hang you once
we arrive in Red Rock.

CHRIS
I can damn well guarantee that too.

JOHN RUTH
Yeah Marquis, that's the thing ‘bout
old men. You can kick ‘em down the stairs
but you can't shoot ‘em. No matter how
annoying they are.

OSWALDO

aN Now gentlemen we may be trapped here
close together like for a few days.
May i suggest a possible solution? We
divide Minnie's in half. The Northern
side and The Southern side. With the
dinner table operating as neutral
territory. We could say the bar acts
as a symbolic representive of Georgia.
While the fire side of the room
represents..... Philadelphia.

Maj.Warren walks over to the bar, by Gen.Smithers....
All eyes on him....
MAJ .WARREN
I'm okay with that. Except..
(slapping his hand

«...the bar's Philadelphia.

EXT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - DAY

We see Maj.Warren and O.B. in this bad weather remove the dead
(= bodies from on top of the stagecoach.
63"

It ain't easy.

The Shot starts ZOOMING BACK until we realize we're looking
at them through a glass window with Oswaldo.

OSWALDO MOBRAY
The little English man sips coffy as he watches the two Americans
deal with the dead bodies.

JOE GAGE
lies dozing on a cot.

CHRIS & GEN.SMITHERS
Continue to talk sitting in the two cozy chairs by the fire.

BOB .
stirs the BIG STEW POT on the fire.

JOHN RUTH (w/Domergue)
pours himself a new cup of coffy from a freshly made pot.

As he drinks he sees the discarded HALF PLUCKED CHICKEN again in
the kitchen area.

BOB

Checks the stew, replaces the lid on the top of the pot, and turns
around to face John Ruth (w/Domergue) holding the half plucked
chicken in his hand.

JOHN RUTH

(meaning the

chicken)
What the hell is this?

BOB
It's a chicken.

JOHN RUTH
No it's not. It's a half plucked chicken.
A half plucked chicken is bad luck.
We don't need bad luck in a blizzard.
Now what's it doing here?

BOB
I was plucking it when your stage
arrived.

JOHN RUTH
And you stopped to take care of the
passengers?

BOB
Oui.
67.

JOHN RUTH
Well...your not taking care of the
passengers now?

BOB
I thought better to deal with the stew.

John Ruth roughly shoves the chicken in his hand;

JOHN RUTH
Pluck the chicken.

Bob takes the chicken from John Ruth and sits down on a stool and
finishes the job of plucking it.

Everybody watches this.

At this point almost everybody in the story has been bullied by
John Ruth at some point or another.

MAJ.WARREN KICKS THE FRONT DOOR OPEN - The WIND from outside WHIPS
THROUGH THE ROOM - Maj.Warren and O.B. hurry inside and SLAM the
door behind them - 0.B. holds the door closed as Maj.Warren POUNDS
nails into two pieces of wood nailing the door closed.

When Maj.Warren finishes, he drops the hammer to the floor.

0.B. says;

o.B.
That damn doors a dirty whore.

The two freezing men head straight for the pot belly stove and the
coffy pot.

They're so cold they don't even remove their Winter coats.

John Ruth picks up the coffy pot and starts pouring the hillbilly
and the black man cups.

JOHN RUTH
I just made some more coffy. Git some
in ya.
They drink the coffy.
JOHN RUTH

(quietly to

Maj.Warren)
We still got that same deal we talked
about in the wagon? I help you protect
your eight thousand, you help me protect
my ten?
Jo.

Maj.Warren looks

MAJ .WARREN
Yeah, i guess.

JOHN RUTH
One of them fella's
(meaning Bob or Joe
or Oswaldo or Chris)
is not what he says he is.

O.B.
What is he?

JOHN RUTH
He's in cahoots with this one

(meaning Domergue)
that's what he is..One of them, maybe
even two of ‘em, is here to see Domergue
goes free. And to accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everybody in here.

over to Domergue who hasn't any expression.

JOHN RUTH

(CON'T)
And they got 'em a coupla' days. So all
they gotta' do is sit tight and wait for
a winda' of opportunity. And that's when
they strike, huh bitch?

DOMERGUE
If you say so, John.

MAJ.WARREN
(to John Ruth)
Are you sure your not just being paranoid?

John Ruth doesn't even entertain the question, he just continues;

JOHN RUTH
Our best bet is this duplicitis fella'
ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here.
He won't have the leather patience it
takes to just sit here and wait.

O.B.
Wait for what?

JOHN RUTH
A opportunity to kill us all. But waiting
for a opportunity, and knowing it's the
right one, isn't easy. If he can't handle
it, he'll stop waiting. He'll try an'
create his opportunity. And that's when
Mr.Jumpy reveals himself.
u,

JOHN RUTH
[7 (CON'T)
And i bet he does it 'fore mornin'.
I bet he does it way 'fore mornin’.

Maj.Warren turns his head in the direction of Domergue.

MAJ .WARREN
What do you got to say about all this?

DOMERGUE
What do i got to say? About John Ruth's
raving's? He's absolutely right. Me and
one of them fella's is in cahoots. And
we're just waitin' for everybody to go
to sleep, that's when we gonna' kill y'all.
Then we just sit tight, drink Mezcal
and eat stew till the sun comes out.

JOHN RUTH
See, what i tell ya' ? She even admits it.
MAJ.WARREN
I think she was just bein' funny.
JOHN RUTH
Really Major? You think she's funny?
cr 2 Well if you do, you just might die laughin'.

Maj.Warren and O.B. can't quite tell if this old bastred is on to
something or a hopeless loon.

JOE GAGE
lying down on the cot, with his cowboy hat over his face, hears
the bounty hunter John Ruth call out to the room;

JOHN RUTH VOICE(0S)
Okay everybody, hear this.

Joe takes the hat away from his face, and remaining vertical
listens to the bounty hunters speech.

JOHN RUTH (w/Domergue) stands in the middle of the room, talking
to the other people inside of Minnie's.

JOHN RUTH

(pointing at Domergue)
This here is Daisy Domergue. She's
wanted dead or alive for murder.
Ten thousand dollars. That money's mine
boys. Don't wanna' share it, ain't gonna’

os lose it. When the sun comes out, i'm

taking this woman into Red Rock to hang.

Now is there anybody here committed to
to stopping me from doing that?
72.

Nobody says anything.

Not Oswaldo Mobray.

Not Joe Gage.

Not

Not

Not

Not

The Major.

Chris and the Old General.

JOHN RUTH
Really?
(beat)
Nobody gotta' problem with this?

Nobody says anything.

John Ruth (taking Domergue with him) slowly crosses the room;

JOHN RUTH
Well I guess that's very fortunate for
me. However, i hope you will all understand,
I just can't take your word. Circumstances
force me to take precautions.

When John Ruth stops walking, he's standing at the foot of Joe
Gage's cot, looking down at the reclining cowboy.

Looking up at the bounty hunter, the cow puncher says;

JOE GAGE
When you say precautions, why do i feel
you mean me?

JOHN RUTH

Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son.
JOE GAGE

You are?
JOHN RUTH

Yes i am. Nothing personal.

JOE GAGE
Just mine? The Hangman got himself a gun?

JOHN RUTH
I'll be dealing with his gun after i deal
with yours.
73.

Joe Gage raises from his reclined position to a sitting position,
with his hand slowly drifting to the butt of the pistol on his
hip.

JOE GAGE
Feel kinda' naked without it.

John Ruth puts his hand on the butt of his gun, and says;
JOHN RUTH
I still got mine. Don't be scarred.
I'll protect you.
Joe Gage almost can't believe the degree of basterd that is John
Ruth. Still in his sitting position, he places his hand on the
butt of his gun.
Domergue, standing there next to John Ruth, thinks, oh shit.
Joe Gage looking up at John Ruth says;
JOE GAGE
A bastreds work is never done,
huh John Ruth?
John Ruth looking down at Joe Gage says;

JOHN RUTH
That's right, Joe Gage. Gimmie the gun.

Joe Gage laughs a little to himself at John Ruth's brazen
masculinity, then opens his mouth to say something cool....

WHEN...

Major Warren SWIFTLY COMES UP BEHIND HIM - THROWING HIS ARM ACROSS
HIS NECK - AND A KNIFE BLADE DUG DEEP (but not too deep) INTO THE
SIDE OF JOE GAGE'S NECK.

Joe Gage starts to struggle.

MAJ.WARREN
Calm down.

Joe Gage freezes.
MAJ .WARREN
(CON'T)
Take your hands away from your pistol.

He does.
74.

MAJ.WARREN
(CON'T)
Blink your eyes if your calm.
Joe Gage BLINKS.

Maj.Warren looks up at John Ruth;

MAJ .WARREN
Did he blink?

JOHN RUTH
He blinked.

MAJ.WARREN

(to Joe Gage)
You sure your calm?

Joe Gage BLINKS.

JOHN RUTH
He blinked.

MAJ.WARREN
Take his gun.

John Ruth reaches down and removes Joe Gages pistol from the
holster on his hip. As he does he tries to soften the blow.

JOHN RUTH
I'm real sorry about this, son. Like i said,
nothing personal. Just a precaution.
Maj.Warren says to Joe Gage;

MAJ.WARREN
Blink if your still calm?

Joe Gage BLINKS.

JOHN RUTH
He blinked.

MAJ.WARREN
Blink if your gonna' remain calm?

Joe Gage BLINKS.

JOHN RUTH
He blinked.
75.

MAJ .WARREN
(to Joe Gage)
Okay, let's give it a try.

Maj.Warren takes the knife away, lets go of Joe Gage's neck, and
quickly backs away.

Joe doesn't over react once he's freed.

He touches his throat. Touches the blood running down the side of
his neck.

He removes a BANDANNA from his pocket, and ties it around his neck
where the knife wound was. As he does he glances over his shoulder
at Maj.Warren .
JOE GAGE
(to Maj.Warren)
Pretty sneaky.

MAJ .WARREN
folds up his knife as he looks back at Joe.

John Ruth approaches Oswaldo the hangman.
JOHN RUTH
I'm afraid the same applies to you too
Mr.Mobray.

Oswaldo holds open his suit jacket, exposing his pistol in it's
holster on his belt, for John Ruth to extract.

OSWALDO
Precautions must be taken because life
is too sweet to lose.
John Ruth removes the gun from the holster on Mobray's hip.
Then the bounty hunter places both pistols on a table.

John Ruth asks Domergue;

JOHN RUTH
Hand me that little bucket.

She hands him a little bucket.

He takes the two men's pistols apart piece by piece, and places
the pieces in the little bucket. John crumbles the weapons in his
hands like dirt clods.

JOHN RUTH
0.B.?
16.

os

O.B. steps up.

JOHN RUTH
** Go to the outhouse.
Dump this bucket down the shit hole.

O.B.
Why do i gotta’ go out side?

JOHN RUTH
Your jacket's already on. And i sorta
kinda trust you.

Ruth looks at Joe Gage and Oswaldo Mobray.
JOHN RUTH
When we get to Red Rock I'll replace the
weapons you lost. That's the best i can
do. When he leaves, you two nail the
door behind him.
O.B. takes the little bucket , and YANKS THE FRONT DOOR OPEN -
The WIND from outside WHIPS TROUGH THE ROOM - Oswaldo holds the
door closed as Joe HAMMERS nails into the door.
John Ruth turns to Bob.
JOHN RUTH
{to Bob)
Okay, Mr.French, where's your guns?

BOB
I don't have a gun.

JOHN RUTH
What's that?

John Ruth points at a double barrel shotgun mounted on the wall.

BOB
Oh well, there's that.

Bob takes the shotgun off the wall and hands it to John Ruth.

He cracks opens the weapon and removes two shotgun shells. Placing
them on a nearby table.

John, holding the shotgun by the barrel, walks to the stone
fireplace, and SMASHES the wooden stock against the stones.

He tosses the useless gun to the floor, and looks to his audience.
72.

JOHN RUTH
So any more guns i don't know about?
Now later i'm gonna’ remember asking
this question, and i'm going to remember
your answer. So, one more time, any guns
I don't know about?

JOE GAGE
You got 'em all chief. We're your prisoner.

JOHN RUTH
Oh don’t be so melodramatic, Joe Gage.
I just stopped ya' from shootin" me in
the back is all.

(beat)
I know at least one of you wanna’ kill
me.

(meaning Domergue)
Counting her, two of ya'.
But without guns....killing me ain't
gonna be so easy.

Bob the Frenchman steps up.

JOHN RUTH
You stepin' up to take the challenge,
Mr.French?

BOB
I just want to make a announcement.

JOHN RUTH
What announcement?

BOB
Stews on.

JOHN RUTH
Well then, lets eat.

Everybody except Gen.Smithers moves to the kitchen area.
Chris tries to get the General to come over, but he refuses.
Preferring to sit in his chair by the fire by himself.

Bob has laid out a number of bowls, and big brown wooden spoons.
7%.

One by one they go to the stew pot, take the ladle, pour some stew

7 in the bowl, sit down at the picnic table, and eat.

John Ruth & Domergue.
Chris Mannix.

Major Marquis Warren.
Oswaldo Mobray.

Joe Gage.

O.B.

and last up, Bob.

Everybody eats in silence. Silence that is except for all the
GOBBLING SOUNDS as they gobble up the stew.

JOHN RUTH & DOMERGUE
are having a little trouble eating with their hands cuffed to each
other.

John Ruth takes the TINY HANDCUFF KEY out of his pocket, and holds
it up for his female prisoner to see.

—™ JOHN RUTH

I'm gonna' let you loose while we eat.

Don't get any ideas, I ain't goin' soft
on ya'. You lift your ass even one inch
off this seat, i'11 put a bullet right

in your goddamn throat.

He UNLOCKS the handcuffs.

For the second time in the movie, Domergue's free from Big John's
iron.

With their stew bowls in front of them, they still sit next to
each other, they just scoot away a bit.

Maj.Warren eats his stew, then looks over at the old man by the
fire.

General Sandford Smithers sits alone in his grey uniform, bathed
in crackling and cackling FIRE LIGHT.

Maj.Warren gets up from the table, taking his stew bowl and big
wooden spoon with him. He walks over to the stew pot, pours some
food into a empty bowl. Picks up a big wooden spoon. Walks over to
where Gen.Smithers sits. And places the stew bowl and spoon next
to him on a little table.
Gen.Smithers looks to the stew bowl, then up at the black fella'
in Calvary pants that stands over him.

Across the room Chris Mannix yells at Maj.Warren;

CHRIS
Warren goddamit, you leave that old man
alone!

Maj.Warren yells across the room right back;

MAJ.WARREN
Stand down you son-of-a-bitch, I shared
a battle field with this man.

That makes Chris stand down.

Gen.Smithers remains silent looking straight ahead, not
acknowledging Maj.Warren.

Maj.Warren looks down at the old man in the cozy chair.

MAJ.WARREN
Or would you deny me that too?

Gen.Smithers doesn't look in Maj.Warren's direction..... Then
says;

GEN. SMITHERS
I suppose you were there.

Maj.Warren points at the empty cozy chair across from the old
general.
MAJ.WARREN
May i join you?

After a clock tick or two, without looking up at him, the old man
says;

GEN.SMITHERS
Yes you may.

Holding his stew bowl and big wooden spoon, Maj.Warren sits in the
chair opposite Gen.Smithers. Maj.Warren is coming correct to the
old southern general, at least as far as the old southern general
is concerned. Correct due to age, due to rank, and due to race.
8a.

~~

The two men sit in silence, as Maj.warren eats a spoonful of stew.

GEN. SMITHERS
What's in the stew?

MAJ.WARREN
I don't know.
(yelling to
Bob)
Hey Bob! Whats in the stew?

Bob answers.

BOB
Beaver, buck, and horse.

The Old Man snorts.

GEN. SMITHERS
There ain't no buck in that bowl.

The Old Man picks up the spoon and the bowl next to him, and
shoves some in his mouth. Then, with some brown stew staining his
grey beard, Smithers says;

GEN. SMITHERS
A lotta’ horse. Lotta' possum be my
guess.

The two men sit in their chairs by the fire, eating out of their
bowls.

Bob finishes at the picnic table, and moseys over to the piano,
and begins tinkering with it.

The two former civil war officers continue to eat.

MAJ.WARREN
Hows life been since the war?

GEN. SMITHERS
Got both of my legs. Got both of my arms.
Can't complain

MAJ .WARREN
Got a woman?

GEN. SMITHERS
Fever took her beginning this winter.

MAJ.WARREN
Me I never went in for a woman regular.
GEN. SMITHERS
In my day no one asked you if you went
in for it. You just did it.

MAJ.WARREN
What was her name?

GEN. SMITHERS

Betsy.
MAJ.WARREN

Georgia girl?
GEN.SMITHERS

Atlanta. Atlanta girl and a Augsta boy.
(pause)

I use to raise Kentucky horses. Her Paw'
owned the breedership I purchased most

of my ponies from. I made a good deal

on her. Used that steak i got from him.
Purchased a few peach orchards. Set myself
up pretty good. Did a hellva'’ lot better
then my no good brothers, that's for damn
sure. All in all....can't compliant.

Betsy took fat after our boy. But i never
minded that. She was a nice woman, i never
minded anything she did.

MAJ.WARREN
Yeah, your son came up here a coupla'
years ago. He spoke highly of his mama
too.

A SHARP STING goes through Sandy Smithers body as he shifts his
focus on the black man.

GEN. SMITHERS
You knew my boy?

MAJ.WARREN
Did i know ‘em?

(small chuckle)
Yeah....I knew ‘em.

The old man snorts.

GEN. SMITHERS
You didn't know 'em.

Maj.Warren places his stew bowl aside, and says;

MAJ.WARREN
Fine, suit yourself.
82.

Maj.Warren stands and the old man grabs his wrist.

GEN. SMITHERS
Didja' know my boy?

Maj.Warren looks down at the frantic old man, and says calmly;

MAJ.WARREN
I know the day he died, do you?

The old man is hit in the heart. He croaks out a ;

GEN. SMITHERS
No.

Looking down at the febel old man in the chair;

MAJ.WARREN
Wanna’ know what day that was?

The old man clutches the black man's sleeve tighter.

GEN. SMITHERS
Yes.

The black man leans down slightly closer to the old man, and says;

eos MAJ.WARREN

The day he met me.
The white old man falls back in his chair.

As Bob plunks out a tune on the piano, the black bounty hunter
removes one of his pistols from his gun belt, and places it on the
little table next to Sandy Smithers chair.

The old man looks down at it.

Then with one pistol left in his gun belt, Maj.Warren walks over
to the bar in Philadelphia, leans against it sideways, and
continues talking to the old man in Georgia.

MAJ .WARREN
He came up here to do a little nigger
head huntin'. By then the reward was
five thousand and bragging rights.
But back then to battle hard rebs, five
thousand just to cut off a niggers head,
that was good money. So the Johnny's
climbed this mountain, lookin" for fortune.
But there was no fortune to be found.
All they found was me.
cf (MORE)
83,

MAJ.WARREN

co (CON'T)

All them fella's came up here, when they
found themself's at the mercy of a

niggers gun, sang a different tune.

"Let's just forget it. I go my way, you

go yours", that's your boy Chester talkin'.

The old man by the fire SCREAMS AT HIM from across the room;

GEN.SMITHERS
You a damn lie!

MAJ .WARREN
"If you just let me go home to my family,
i'll never set foot in Wyoming again",
that's what they all said. Some of them
ole' boys had some real sad stories to
tell too. Beggin' for his life, your boy
told me his WHOLE LIFE STORY. And you
was in that story, General. And when I
knew me I had the boy of The Bloody
Nigger Killer of Baton Rouge.... I knew
me I was gonna' have some fun.

The other people, most of which are still around the picnic table,
know exactly what Maj.Warren is doing. He's placed a loaded pistol

(“by the old man, and now is trying to provoke Gen.Smithers to pick

it up, and point it at the black man. At which point the black man
can legally shoot him dead in self defense.

Chris Mannix is on his feet YELLING at the black man and the old
white man;

CHRIS

(to Maj.Warren)
You shut your liein' nigger lips up!

(to Gen.Smithers)
Gen.Smithers, don't listen to ‘em, he
don't know your boy! He just heard tell
why you here is all! He's just peckin'
at ya' for a fight!

MAJ .WARREN
(to Gen.Smithers)
It was cold the day i killed your boy.
And i don't mean snowy mountain
in Wyoming cold....Colder then that.
And on that cold day, with your boy at
the business end of my gun barrel....
...I made him STRIP. Right down to his
bare ass. Then i told him to start walkin’.

FLASH TO

EXT - SNOWY VISTA IN THE MOUNTAINS - DAY
We see what Maj.Warren describes.
But we see the BIG WIDE 70MM SUPER CINEMASCOPE VERSION.

A magnificent white Wyoming winter vista, and inside of it,
Maj.Warren on his horse Lash, pointing a rifle at A NAKED WHITE MAN
walking ahead of him in the snow.

MAJ.WARREN'S VOICE(OS)
I walked his naked ass for two hours....

Then we see the Naked White Man collapse in the snow.
Maj.Warren holds up his horse, and watches the cold man.

MAJ.WARREN'S VOICE(OS)
...'fore the cold collapsed him.

BACK TO MINNIE'S
CU GEN.SMITHERS

GEN.SMITHERS
You never knew my boy!

Chris joins in;

CHRIS
No he didn't! He's just a sneaky nigger
tryin' to getcha to go for that gun!
This black devil's a bounty hunter,
that's how bounty hunters do!

Maj.Warren just continues with his story. His concentration
unaffected by the other voices in the room.

MAJ .WARREN

(CON'T)
Then he started in begging again. But
this time he wasn't begging to go home.
He knew he'd never see his home again.
And he wasn't beggin' for his life no
more. That was long gone and he knew it.
He was just beggin' for a BLANKET.
Now don't judge your son too harshly.
You ain't never been as cold as your boy
was that day. You'd be surprised what a
man that cold, would-do-for-a-blanket.
8s.

MAJ.WARREN
{CON'T)
Wanna' know what your boy did?

The old man watches the storyteller, eyes bulging out of his head.

MAJ .WARREN

(pause)
I took my big black pecker outta’ my pants.
And i made him crawl in the snow on all
fours over to it. Then I grabbed a hand
full of that black hair on the back of
his head.....

The old man leans forward in his chair.

MAJ .WARREN

(beat)
Then I stuck that big black Johnson
right down his goddamn throat. And that
Johnson was fulla' blood. So it was warm.
You bet your sweet ass it was warm. And
Chester Charles Smithers sucked on that
warm black dingus as long as he could.

FLASH ON

EXT - SNOWY VISTA - DAY

We see what Maj.Warren describes in BIG WIDE 70MM SUPER
CINEMASCOPE.

A WHITE WINTER WYOMING VISTA, and inside of that vista, is a Naked
White Man on his knees sucking the dick of a Heavily Clothed Black
Man in the snow.

BACK TO MINNIE'S

CU GEN.SMITHERS
the old man is in knots. It was worse then his imagination ever
dared. He knows the truth when he hears it. This is how Chester
ended his life.

CU MAJ.WARREN
the black Major has the white General right where wants him. He
flashes a alligator grin, and says;

MAJ.WARREN
Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?

%.

MAJ.WARREN

(CON'T)
Your son. Black dudes dingus in his
mouth. Him shiverin'’ - him cryin'-
me laughin' - him not understandin'.
But you understand, doncha' Sandy?

(beat )
I never did give your boy that blanket.
Even after all he did, and he did
everything I asked. No blanket.
That blanket was just a heart breakin’
liars promise. Sorta' like when the
union issued those colored troopers
uniforms....that you chose not to
acknowledge.

Maj.Warren makes his point.
It's a pretty good one.

MAJ .WARREN
So what are you gonna' do old man?
You gonna’ spend the next two or three
days ignoring the nigger who killed
your boy? Ignoring how I made him suffer?
Ignoring the agony I inflicted?
Ignoring how I made him lick all over
my Johnson? Yep', the dumbest thing
your boy ever did, was let me know he

was your boy.

The Old Man LEAPS TO HIS FEET GRABBING THE GUN, bringing the
pistols barrel up towards Maj.Warren at the bar.

Barely even turning towards him, Maj.Warren calmly and smoothly
pulls his pistol from his holster, and puts a bullet square in the
Old Man's chest.

Maj.Warren's pistol BLOWS GEN.SMITHERS OFF HIS FEET and INTO
THE ROARING FIREPLACE.

His old uniform CATCHES FIRE, and he FLIP FLOPS on the floor,
letting out a HIGH PITCHED SCREAM as The Old Man burns.

Some of the people at Minnie's run to put out the fire.
Maj.Warren DRAWS HIS GUN stopping them.

MAJ.WARREN
Let ‘em burn.

And burn he does.

Till he's dead.
87.

CHRIS
We gotta’ put it out ‘fore it burns
this whole place down!

Major Marquis replaces his pistol back in it's holster.

MAJ .WARREN
Go ahead.

They put out the blazing body till it's just a smoldering corpse.

Once the fire is put out, Maj.Warren, Chris Mannix, John Ruth, and
Oswaldo Mobray get into a extended and spirited discussion about
the legality of what just transpired.

Bob and Joe Gage, lift the dead body of Gen.Smithers, and carry
him to a door in the floor. Bob opens the door, and Bob and Joe
carry the corpse down the stairs into the cellar.

DOMERGUE

still sitting at the picnic table, still unchained from John Ruth.
While debate goes back and forth among the men, Daisy

Domergue has other things on her mind. Daisy Domergue knows a
secret. A secret nobody else in the room knows. Nobody else except
a Killer.

The debate, which wasn't going anywhere, breaks up due to lack of
oxygen. And John Ruth makes a bee-line for the coffy pot on the
pot belly stove.

Domergue watches him go for the coffy pot.

John Ruth pours himself a cup from the coffy pot.

Domergue smiles to herself.

O.B. walks up to John Ruth, the bounty hunter pours the stagecoach
driver a cup of coffy. 0.B. takes A BIG DRINK OF COFFY and heads
back towards the bar.

Domergue watches him cross the room to the bar, then her eyes go
back to John Ruth.

John Ruth walks back over to the table that Domergue is sitting
at. He still HASN'T DRUNK ANY COFFY. He reaches the table...

WHEN.....-

The STRONG WIND outside BLOWS THE FRONT DOOR OPEN - The WIND WHIPS
THROUGH THE ROOM - John Ruth turns towards it - He places his
undrunk coffy cup down on the table in front of Domergue.

Her eyes go to the cup, then back up to him. She bites her lip.
&3.

Oo

John Ruth starts to head off to deal with the door, hesitates,
turns back around, picks up the coffy cup, and takes a drink, then
puts it back on the table before running to the door.

Domergue unbites her lip, and smiles to herself.

John Ruth gets to the windy door, 0.B. joins him. But this time
before they close the door, they look outside.

EXT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - SUNSET

It's magnificently beautiful. Windy, but beautiful. The SUNSET IN
THE SKY paints not only the sky in gorgeous colors, it casts those
colors against the surrounding white snow.

Wind whipping around them, John Ruth and O.B. take in the sight.

INT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - NIGHT

They SLAM the door shut. 0.B. holds the door, as John Ruth HAMMERS
nails in the door.

Domergue sitting by herself watches the two men by the door,
unable to wipe a half smile off her face.

From here on end, the sun starts going down outside, and Minnie's
becomes a lot darker and colder place. Little by little the different
characters start putting on their winter coats inside.

Bob, O.B., and Chris start walking around the shack, LIGHTING
CANDLES and LANTERNS. As the following scene progresses, the
LIGHTING TURNS FROM DAY TO NIGHT.

John Ruth walks back over to Domergue's table. He picks up the
coffy cup, DRINKS SOME MORE, and sits down next to Domergue.

He holds out the coffy cup, offering her some;

JOHN RUTH
Want some?

DOMERGUE
No thanks. It's getting late.
Coffy makes me jumpy.

JOHN RUTH
You look a little jumpy. Must be all
this Freedom.

He grabs her arm and LOCKS himself back in the handcuff attached
to her wrist.
27.

DOMERGUE
Awwww John, I thought -

JOHN RUTH
- You thought wrong, bitch.

DOMERGUE
If you just give me a chance _

JOHN RUTH
- Bitch, you had your chance. Your
whole goddamn worthless life was a chance.
A chance you squandered. Now comes time
to pay for all your evil horseshit...you
belly ache.

DOMERGUE
You the one gonna’ get the belly ache,
John.

Ruth doesn't know what that means, but he doesn't know what half
the things she says means. He figures she's calling him fat.

Chris sees Maj.Warren by himself in Philadelphia (the bar), and
approaches him.

CHRIS
May a poor southern boy visit the
Philadelphia bar, enjoy libation,
and return home to Georgia unmolsted?

MAJ.WARREN
Come to collect my head? Ain't no money
in it, no more. But bragging rights are
still available. Tequila or Mezcal?

CHRIS
Tequila.

Maj.Warren pours him a drink of Tequila in his coffy cup.
Then the Major slides the cup in front of the Cap't.

The Cap't picks it up, swirls it around a little bit, then
swallows it in one gulp.

He almost gags (not like a comedy, but like a real person).
CHRIS
(about the tequila)
That'll get ya’ where your goin'.

Chris takes the bottle and pours Maj.Warren a Tequila.
Yo,

em Maj.Warren drinks it.

MAJ.WARREN
So about your friends death, you seem
to be on the reasonable side of things?

CHRIS

(waving his

hand dismissivly)
Awww, he was old.

(beat)
The yankee death count at Wellenbeck
was thirty-three. Before i wasn't sure
if you didn't know or just didn't want
to say in front of your new friend John
Ruth.

(whispers)
I won't tell ‘em.

DOMERGUE (w/John Ruth)
watches 0.B. light candles, he seems fine.

BOB
lights a lantern.

CHRIS & MAJ.WARREN AT BAR

CHRIS
You said earlier, that you got into the
war to kill Johnny Reb and Crackers,
and a lotta' other names that mean White
Folks. So i think, you got into the war
to kill white folks. And the Grey and
the Blue of it all, wasn't really that
important to you. I mean if you can kill
the Grey ones, and it don't cost nothin',
well, why not? But any Blue ones get on
your nerves, you can kill them too.
Just gotta' be a little more sneeky
about it, is all. You moved up the ranks
like me, Major, the hard way. I know you
killed Blue officers before don't nobody
know "bout. These sons-a-bitches didn't
know their ass from a hole in the ground.
If you didn't kill the bad officers,
you'd never get a good one. So you know
going into Wellenbeck, that these inbred,
West Virginia hill people - not hillbillies,
i'm a hillbilly. Hill-People peckawoods,
finally got their hands on your black ass.

(7 DOMERGUE SITTING NEXT TO JOHN RUTH
keeps a eye on O.B. as he lights candles. As well as John next to
her. Any moment now.

CHRIS & MAJ.WARREN

As Chris continues to make his point to Maj.Warren, he gets up and
walks across the room, to the pot of coffy on the pot belly stove.
CHRIS
(CON'T)
Southern prisoner war camps were beatin’
starvin' and whippin' white yankees to
death. What 'cha think they do toa
black yankee, a black yankee like you?
He pours himself A CUP OF COFFY.
DOMERGUE
Suddenly sees this, and the closest thing to a break in the young
lady's resolve we've seen so far, flashes across her face.
CHRIS
with the coffy in his hand, walks back towards Maj.Warren, as he
continues;
CHRIS
(CON'T)
Oh, and the white yankee prisoners,
you know, your side...? They'd be at
your throat just as quick.
He gets back to the bar.
CHRIS
And i say to get out of Wellenbeck
Military Prison, you'd burn a hundred
white folks alive. And if a few Blues
happen to get caught in the blaze...
..chalk it up to "War is hell".
He brings the coffy up to his lips.
THEN...
Lighting four candles 0.B. 's GUTS EXPLODEVOMITING BLOOD....
He SCREAMS in agony....retching and cringing in pain...then vomits
more blood....collapsing to the floor holding his guts.
John Ruth not understanding whats happening, looks to his handcuff
partner, who's face shows she does.
Domergue smiles and bats her eyes at him.
DOMERGUE
(7 When you get to hell, John?

Tell ‘em Daisy sent ya'.
92.

John Ruth gets it.

ROARING he stands up, and takes his big fist and PUNCHES DAISY RIGHT
SQUARE IN THE MOUTH.

Her head SNAPS VIOLENTLY BACK, as her lips EXPLODE BLOOD. When her
head comes back, she SPITS OUT HER TWO FRONT TEETH, and laughs at
him.

Ruth quickly turns to Chris Mannix with the cup of coffy in his hand;

JOHN RUTH
Mannix, the coffy!

Everybody in the room hears this.
Mannix throws his coffy cup to the floor, undrunk.

Ruth turns back to Domergue's laughing bloody face.....and PUNCHES
it again, knocking her to the floor.

Daisy continues to laugh, as he climbs on top of her, grabbing a
handful of her hair with one hand, and bringing his other fist
SMASHING IN HER FACE.

THEN....

The poison hits John Ruth's guts, he RETCHES....and PUKES BLOOD
ALL OVER DAISY.

Daisy just laughs.....
He brings another powerful fist down on her face....
His guts turn more....
He PUKES MORE BLOOD....

The pain in his guts makes him roll off of her on to the floor
holding his sides...

He looks at her next to him...
Domergue laughs.

He weakly takes out his pistol from the holster on his hip....
she grabs at it....chained together they struggle over the gun...

Everybody watches the struggle on the floor.
His guts retch again...he doubles over...leaving Domergue the

pistol...she holds it with both hands....pointing the barrel point
blank at the bounty hunters face....she cocks back the hammer....
93.

o

Maj.Warren's boot comes INTO FRAME KICKING the gun away as it
FIRES.

The bullet sails over John Ruth's head.

One of Maj.Warren's hands grabs Domergue by the hair, the other
grabs the gun and wrestles it away from her grip, then hits her
in the head with it, knocking her back.

Gun in hand, Maj.Warren looks to John Ruth on the floor.

Ruth lies dead.

THEN....

MAJ.WARREN
turns the pistol on everybody else in the room

MAJ.WARREN
Everybody get your back sides up
against that back wall!

JOE GAGE
Look goddamit -

Maj.Warren FIRES his pistol.

The bullet STRIKES the top of a wooden chair, right besides Joe
Gage's hand. The WOOD EXPLODES right next to Joe Gage's flesh,
burning, stinging, cutting, and shocking him.

Gage jumps back, holding his stinging hand, looking at Maj.Warren.

MAJ .WARREN
Get or don't get Gage. It's up to you.

JOE GAGE
I'll get.

MAJ.WARREN
Then get.

Joe Gage gets up against the wall with the other men in the room.

Chris Mannix, Oswaldo Mobray, Joe Gage, and Bob stand in a line,
backs to the wall.

Domergue sits on the ground, wrist still handcuffed to the wrist
of the dead bad ass, John Ruth.

MAJ .WARREN
two guns in hand, one of his own, the other John Ruth's , a third
in the holster on his hip, keeps them pointed at the four men.
9¢.

laa Maj.Warren looks down at O.B.
Dead.
He looks to John Ruth and Domergue on the floor.
One dead, one stares back with hate.
Then he looks to the four men he has lined up against the wall.
MAJ.WARREN
(to the room)
Y'all keep your mouth shut and do what
I tell ya'. Anybody opens their mouth,
gonna' get a bullet. Anybody moves a
little weird....little sudden - gonna'
get a bullet. Not a warning. Not a
question. A bullet. Now y'all got that?
They acknowledge.
Using John Ruth's line, the Major says;

MAJ .WARREN
Let me hear you say, "I got it".

f™\ He makes them say it.
MAJ.WARREN
(CON'T)
Mannix?

Chris Mannix eyes go to him.

MAJ .WARREN
Get over on this side.

Chris moves cautiously away from the wall, to the Major's side of
the room.

MAJ .WARREN
Take that pistol out of this holster.

Indicating the pistol still in the left side holster hanging from
the Major's hip.

Chris looks at him with a expression that says; "Really"?
The Major nods affirmative.
Chris cautiously removes the pistol from the black man's belt.

f ‘, Now Chris has a gun. He looks to the Ma‘jor, who still has two guns
pointed at the other three men against the wall.
MAJ .WARREN
Okay, point it at them. Like I said,
they do anything - and I mean "anything"
- kill ‘em.

Chris Mannix does that.

CHRIS

(to Maj.Warren)
So you finally decided I'm tellin' the
truth ‘bout bein' the sheriff of Red
Rock, huh?

MAJ.WARREN

(to Chris)
I don't know ‘bout all that. But you
ain't the killer who poisoned that
coffy. You almost drunk it your own
damn self.

The Majors eyes go back to the three men against the wall.

MAJ .WARREN
(to them)
But one of y'all is.

The Major hears something, and he turns towards Domergue on the
floor.

She has dug the TINY HANDCUFF KEY out of John Ruth's pocket, and
is just about to stick it in the lock and free herself from the
corpse.

Maj.Warren points one of his pistols at her, and FIRES into the FLOOR
next to her. The SOUND in the enclosed log cabin is ear drum
exploding LOUD. She freezes.

Maj.Warren has one arm outstretched holding a gun pointed at the
three men against the wall. The other arm is holding a gun pointed
at Domergue on the floor. He takes the gun pointed at Domergue,
and places it back in it's holster. Then he holds his hand out
palm up to Domergue.

MAJ .WARREN
Gimmie the key.

It breaks her heart, but she places the tiny handcuff key in the
palm of his hand, his fingers close around it.

Maj.Warren walks across the room to the pot belly stove. He opens
the door of the stove above the fire, and TOSSES THE TINY KEY
INSIDE.
96 .

Domergue, who's modus operandi is outrageous behavior and the

disarming affect
did what he did.

Maj.Warren turns

it has on opponents, can't believe Marquis just
She SCREAMS AT HIM;

DOMERGUE
YOU MOTHERFUCKING BLACK BASTERD! Your
gonna' die on this mountain and I'm
gonna' fucking laugh when you do!

from the stove and FIRES his pistol at Domergue.

The BULLET EXPLODES in the dead body of John Ruth next to her,
SHOWERING HER WITH RUTH'S BLOOD. It shocks her enough to shut her

up at least.

Major Warren has
on the floor, to

Chris chimes in;

MAJ .WARREN
What I say ‘bout talkin'?
‘Ment it, didn't I?

all the attention in the room. He turns from her
them against the wall.

MAJ .WARREN
Now...one of you....is workin' with her.
Or...two of you are workin' with her.
Or...all y'all is workin' with her.
But only one of you poisoned the coffy.

(Gesturing towards

Domergue)
Now what ever charms this bitch got make
you brave a blizzard and kill in cold blood,
I'm sure i don't know. But....John Ruth's
tryin' to hang your woman, so you kill
him...okay - maybe? But O.B. wasn't
hangin' nobody. He's sure enough dead now
though, ain't he? Just like anyone of
us who'd drank that coffy.

(to the three)
Those of you against the wall don't
practice in poison should think about
that. Think about how that coulda’ been
you rollin' around on the floor.
And about how one of the men next ta‘ ya'
is responsible.

CHRIS
And i know who I got my money on.
(to Joe Gage)
Yeah that's right cow puncher,
i'm lookin' at you.
97.

Bob, pointing at

The Major thinks

MAJ.WARREN

(to Chris)
Not so fast Chris. We'll get there.
Let's slow it down. Let's slow it way
down.

Who made the coffy?

the dead bounty hunter on the floor, says;

BOB
He did.

CHRIS
Yeah, he did didn't he?

MAJ.WARREN
Yes he did.

silently for a moment.

They watch him think.

Then he says;

MAJ .WARREN

(CON'T)
Why is "The Hangman" , who's got
nothing on his mind except gettin'
this girl to the gallows, brewin'
the coffy at Minnie's Haberdashery?

The Little English Man points at The Bearded French Man.

OSWALDO
Because his coffy was awful.

MAJ.WARREN
(to Bob)
Really? Well ain't that interesting.

BOB

(to Maj.Warren)
You didn't have any of my coffy. So don't
be so sure about what this little man
says.

JOE GAGE
I had his coffy. Wasn't the best coffy
I ever drank, but wasn't nothin' wrong
with it.
98.

BOB
co If you want me to make a pot of coffy,
all you have to do is ask.

MAJ.WARREN
Maybe...maybe...but it's the stew got me
thinking. When did you say Minnie left?
A week ago?

BOB
Oui.

MAJ.WARREN
See, when my mama made stew, it always
tasted the same, no matter the meat.
And there.was another fellow on the
planntaion, Uncle Charly, and he made
stew too. And just like my mama's, I ate
his stew from the time i was a whipper
to a full grown man. And no matter the
meat, it always tasted like Uncle Charly's
stew. Now I ain't had Minnie's stew in
‘bout six months or so, so i ain't no
expert. But that damn sure was Minnie's
stew. So...if Minnie's on the north side
visiting her mama...how'd she make the
stew this morning?
co
Maj.Warren moves over to the cozy chair he sat in opposite General
Smithers earlier. It's covered in a blanket and a few animal
skins.

MAJ .WARREN
This is Sweet Dave's chair. When i sat
in it earlier, i couldn't believe it.
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.
I mean this maybe Minnie's place, but
this damn sure is Sweet Dave's chair.
If Sweet Dave did go to the north side,
I'm pretty goddamn sure that chair's
going with him.

He removes the skins and blanket that cover the chair. The cloth
patterned chair has a BIG BLOOD STAIN on it.

Maj.Warren looks to the room for a reaction.

BOB
Are you accusing me of something sinister?
77.

MAJ .WARREN

(to Bob)
Well Bob, it's like this. Who's ever
workin' with her,

(meaning Domergue)
ain't who they say they are.
If it's you, that means Minnie and her
man ain't at her mama's. Their lien'
out back there dead somewhere.

(to Oswaldo)
Or if it's you, the real Oswaldo Mobray
is liein in a ditch somewhere. And your
just a english fella' passin' off his papers.

CHRIS
(to Joe Gage)
Or we go by my theory, which is the
ugliest guy did it. Which makes it you, Joe.

BOB

(to Maj.Warren)
So i take it you've deduced the coffy
was poisoned while you were murdering
the old man?

MAJ .WARREN
Yep.

BOB
Well during that whole incident, i was
sitting on that side of the room,
plucking on the piano.

The piano couldn't be further from the pot belly stove and coffy pot.

MAJ.WARREN

(to Bob)
I didn't say you poisoned the coffy.
I said you didn't make the stew.

(to all)
My THEORY is.....Your working with the

man who poisoned the coffy. And both of
you murdered Minnie, and Sweet Dave,
and anybody else might a picked the wrong
day to visit the haberdashery this morning.
And your intention was, at some point,
ambush John Ruth and free Daisy.
But you didn't expect the blizzard, and
you didn't expect the two of us.

(using the barrel

of his pistol to

indicate both him

and Chris)
That's as far as I got. How am i doin'?
loo.

BOB
That's a pretty imaginative theory,
Mister Black. You gonna' murder three
men on a far fetched nigger theory, or
are you gonna' prove it?

Maj.Warren doesn't answer him, he just moves away from the three
to Chris, and hands him his other pistol.

Chris takes the other pistol and points both smoke wagons at the
trio.

MAJ.WARREN
(to Chris)
Watch ‘em. Watch 'em good.

CHRIS
Don't you worry 'bout me, i won't
hesitate a inch.

Maj.Warren moves away from Chris and the trio, over to where
Domergue chained to the dead John Ruth lies.

He grabs a chair, moves it over by the woman, sits down.

MAJ .WARREN

(to Domergue)
He's right. Me and Chris can't just
shoot them fella's cause we're tired
of trying to figure it out.

(beat)
But not you Domergue. You....on the
other hand...are wanted DEAD OR ALIVE.
That means, with the entire American
Justice System on my side, I can do to
you, pretty much, any goddamn thing I
wanna’. Now when it came to you, ole
John Ruth might not of been too friendly.
But of the two of us, he was the only one
who was committed to see you reach Red
Rock alive.

Domergue says from the floor;

DOMERGUE
Nigger, if you wanna' shoot me, you
can shoot me - ain't nobody can stop
ya'. But that monkey skull of yours
got this figured wrong.

(meaning the

three)
I don't know them fella's.
lel,

MAJ.WARREN
So you think you can brazen it out to
the bitter end, huh bitch? We'll see
how long that lasts.
Major Marquis stands up from the chair.
He walks over to a table, as he does he tells Mannix;

MAJ .WARREN
Both barrels on those three, Mannix.

Chris holds both pistols ready at the trio.
Bob, Oswaldo, and Joe Gage, backs against the wall, watch.

Maj.Marquis, standing by a table, opens the ammo cylinder of his
pistol, and empties out all the cartridges on the table top.

The ammo cylinder of his pistol is empty.
Domergue watches him.
Bob, Oswaldo, and Joe Gage watch him.

Chris could care less what Maj.Warren is doing, he never takes his
undivided attention from the three men.

Major Marquis takes one of the bullets, puts it in the ammo
cylinder, spins it, then snaps it shut.

Then he walks over to Domergue. Standing over her, gun pointed
at her....he asks;

MAJ .WARREN
Which of them are you working with?

DOMERGUE
I told you nigger -

Maj.Warren FIRES...CLICK (empty).
The three men jump a little.
Domergue's heart almost stops.

DOMERGUE
Jesus Christ!

MAJ.WARREN
Oh, you believe in Jesus now?
Well good news bitch, you 'bout to
meet ‘em.
lo2.

Maj.Marquis walks back to the table...opens the cylinder of the
von pistol...picks up another bullet....places it inside the

cylinder....as he walks back towards her, he spins the cylinder,
then snaps it shut.

TWO BULLETS at play.

He brings up the pistol, Domergue instinctively puts her hands up
to sheld herself from the bullets, and pleads with her
executioner;

MAJ.WARREN
Which of then three you workin' with?

DOMERGUEB
Now look, just wait a goddamn minute!
I get it. Your smart. Your real smart!
And your stories good. It makes sense.
It makes a lotta' sense.

(beat)
But this time...you got it wrong.
Three things....

(she counts out

on her fingers)
I don't know these fella's - ain't never
seen 'em before in my life, that's one.
Two. I didn't poison that goddamn coffy!
(= I couldn't lift my ass a inch off that

bench ‘fore John Ruth crack my head

open, how am i suppose to poison coffy?
And three, i don't know who did.

Maj.Marquis FIRES the pistol....BANG (bingo)

The BULLET EXPLODES IN HER LEG.....SHE HOWLS LIKE A WOLF!
Her hand goes to her bloody leg, as she rolls around on the floor
in pain.

The three man jump.

Chris doesn't even flinch. He just sits ready to shoot dead the
first of these three fella's to get froggy.

While Domergue feels the pain of a bullet, Maj.Marquis goes back
to the table, opens the ammo cylinder of the pistol, and adds two
more bullets to the game, spins and snap.

Three bullets in play.
193.

CU DOMERGUE
desperate.

CU OF THE THREE
we track along the three men's faces as they watch this.

CHRIS
doesn't look back. He just tells the three;

CHRIS
Easy boys.

Major Marquis walks over to Domergue. She looks up at him standing
over her.

Maj.Margquis reaches down and grabs Domergue by the back of the
hair, and yanks her head back, then places the pistol barrel
against her forehead, clicks back the hammer with his thumb, and
asks her;

MAJ.WARREN
Last chance bitch, who poisoned that
fuckin' coffy?
THEN...
Before Major Marquis can go any further, a voice yells out;

VOICE(OS)
Hold it!

Still holding Domergue, Major Marquis turns to see who's talking.

The THREE
Joe Gage has his hand raised.

JOE GAGE
I put the poison in the coffy.

Chris smiles.

CHRIS
I fuckin' knew it!

Maj.Marquis lets go of Domergue's hair, she sinks back to the
floor. His thumb replaces the hammer back into safety position on
the pistol. And his and all the rooms attention turn towards Joe
Gage.

The THREE

The other two start moving away from him, leaving Joe Gage in the
frame by himself.

EXT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - MORNING

It's the same day at Minnie's, except early morning. It's cold as
hell, but the storm hasn't hit yet, so the sun's out and it's
amazing looking in 70MM SUPERSCOPE.

A SUBTITLE READS:
“Earlier that morning at Minnie's”

A six horse team lead stagecoach comes roaring up to Minnie's
place. The same stagecoach 0.B. noticed earlier, pulled off to the
side. Up on the driver's seat perch sits Two Drivers ED (a big
older shitkicker type) and SIX-HORSE JUDY (a young female
Calamity Jane type, dressed in buckskin). Judy's on reins, she
pulls the horses to a stop in front of Minnie's.

A chubby half black, half Indian boy wearing a winter coat comes
running out of Minnie's. His name is CHARLY, he works there.

The two drivers up on their perch, look down at young Charly.

ED
Hey Charly my boy, how the hell are you?

CHARLY
Hi ya' Ed, hi ya’ Judy. How many ya' got?

ED
Full house today, friend.

CHARLY
We got one in there waiting.

ED
Well he's gonna’ hafta keep on waitin'
cause we ain't got no room.

CHARLY
Well you need to tell Minnie. Cause he's
been here two days, and Minnie wants him
outta’ here.

ED
Well i can't give him a seat i don't
have -

turns to Judy)
Take the passengers inside, introduce
them to Minnie. Warm yourself up.
Drink some coffy.

Judy jumps off her perch onto the ground.
She looks into the stagecoach door window. Judy being from New
Zealand speaks with a Kiwi accent.

JUDY
Here we are everybody, Minnie's Haberdashery.
Step outside reverend, you and your friends
can stretch your legs. When your ready,
step on inside, get warm by the fire,
get some coffy in you. I'll introduce
you to Minnie.

Judy bounces into Minnie's. We haven't seen the four passengers
yet.

INSERT The DOOR HANDLE

of the stagecoach door, turns. The door opens, the camera pans
down to the Foot Step right below the stagecoach door. A Boot
steps on it. Then Another, and Another, and Another. All stepping
on to foot fall and out of frame.

INT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - MORNING

It's early morning at Minnie's Haberdashery, the business part of
the building just opening for business.

Minnie herself is in the kitchen area. On this mountain the black
woman named MINNIE MINK is a beloved figure. Everybody on this
mountain knows her, and knows her haberdashery.

Sitting in his chair that Maj.Warren talked about is SWEET DAVE.
He's Minnie's something. No one knows for sure what they are to
each other. Rumor has it Minnie use to be Sweet Daves slave.

And after Minnie got her freedom, Sweet Dave didn't want to live
without her. And if she'd stay with him, he'd buy her a place of
her own, she could run anyway she wants. But that's only a rumor.

Sweet Dave sits in one of the two cozy chairs by the fire, playing
CHESS with GENERAL SMITHERS sitting in the chair we first found
him in.

A pretty young black gal with a incredibly sweet smile is in the
kitchen area plucking a chicken, her name is GEMMA.

Judy sits on a table horsing around with Minnie;

JUDY
What'd ya' mean no coffy?

MINNIE
van I haven't had a chance to make it yet,
Judy. I just finished preparing the
stew.
log.

JUDY
(“ Now Minnie, i'm not trying to tell you
how to run your business. But i would
think, coffy, would be the first
thing you'd make.

The FOUR PASSENGERS
walk in. We only see their BOOTS enter Minnie's.

JUDY
sees the Passengers, HOPS off the table to her feet.

JUDY
Come on in everybody, don't be shy.

Minnie takes one look at the four passengers and says one word;

MINNIE
Hats!

The FOUR PASSENGERS
We see the four male passengers. After Minnie yells at them, they
all four snatch off their cowboy hats. The Four Men are lead by a
COUNTRY PREACHER dressed all in black except for a white clergy
collar, and his three cowboy disciples. The three cowboy's with the
Preacher are our old friends OSWALDO MOBRAY, JOE GAGE, and BOB.
: Nether Oswaldo and Bob are dressed in the clothes we met them in.

o Their dressed more like bad ass cowboys, with a bit of a Mexican

flavor to their outfits. Even the Preacher.

JUDY
Everybody, this is Minnie, and this is
her place. Behind her pluckin' that
chicken is Gemma.

Gemma smiles at The Four Passengers.
The Four Passengers walk further in towards Minnie.

JUDY
Nice smile, that Gemma. Now the fella'
in the uniform i don't know

(meaning General

Smithers )
but the one he's playing chess with is
Sweet Dave.

(to Sweet Dave)
Hi ya' Dave!

Sweet Dave waves from his chair.

SWEET DAVE
( Hey Judy.
107,

JUDY
And Minnie, these are the passengers.

MINNIE
Well that's not good enough. Take away
them rags, let's see some faces, let's
hear some names.

The Four Passengers lower the scarfs that sit around their face,

smiling at the friendly black woman.

OSWALDO
Poncho.

JOE GAGE
Fernando.

BOB
Ramon.

The PREACHERMAN
And I'm brother Mateo, and thank you
Sister Minnie for this warm sanctuary in
such a cold hell.

MINNIE
Well, Preacher, Fernando, and Ramon, and
Poncho - funny y'all don't look Mexican?

The PREACHERMAN
We ain't Mexican. But we sure do like
Mexico alot.

MINNIE
Well make your self comfortable.
Get warm by the fire.

The PREACHERMAN
We're just gonna’ go warm ourself's by
the stove, if that's all right?

MINNIE
Please please please....get warm.

The PREACHERMAN
Oh, and Judy said something about the
best coffy in the world....?

MINNIE
Well i don't know ‘bout all that. But
I'll tell ya' what it is. It's Hot and
it's Strong, and it's Good. And in this

Minnie heads for a door in the floor that leads to a cellar, as
she opens it, she tells Ed;

She disappears into the door in the floor, in a cellar underneath

Bob lights it on a near by candle, takes a drag, and thanks her;

BOB

Minnie giggles at being flirted to in french.

The Preacherman moves away from Joe Gage and the pot belly stove, over
to where the two old men are playing chess.

The Preacherman smiles at them and indicates for them to continue
with their game.

The PREACHERMAN
Continue brother, I hope I'm not disturbing?

SWEET DAVE
Hell no. I like whippin' this old mans
ass in front of a audience.

GEN. SMITHERS
You ain't whippin' shit.

Judy comes in carrying some of their luggage. Plopping it on the
floor.

JUDY
I brought in your luggage in case anybody
wants to change your clothes before
Red Rock.

Handsome Joe Gage warms his hand on the pot belly stove,
holding a bag of candy. He offers the female stagecoach driver
a PEPPERMINT SICK. She excepts it.

JOE GAGE
Why do they call you Six Horse Judy?

JUDY
Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever met
who could drive a six horse team....Fernando.

JOE GAGE
Do i look like a Fernando to you?

JUDY
Well now you mention it, no you don't.

JOE GAGE

GEN.SMITHERS
No regrets. Only fond remembrances.

Oswaldo watches Gemma holding the large jar of jelly beans begin
to climb down the ladder.

Ed wraps up his business with the General.

ED
Well, all's well that ends well, i guess.

Putting his hand on the old Generals shoulder.

Minnie calls out;

MINNIE
Coffy's ready!

ED
It's about damn time.

Ed hurries to where Minnie and her coffy pot is.

Joe Gage and Judy stand around the pot belly stove flirting,
sucking on their Peppermint Sticks.

Bob moves towards Ed and the coffy pot.
Ed sees Bob;

ED

(to Bob)

Best coffy on the mountain.

Minnie smiles and waves away the compliment.

MINNIE

(to Bob)

Stagecoach drivers like it. Passengers,
not so much. Most find it a mite too

fo‘ strong.

She pours Ed a cup of coffy.

The Preacherman watching the old men play chess, moves his hand by
his gun butt.

Minnie pours Bob a cup of her coffy.

Oswaldo watching the pretty black gal struggling with the large
jar of jelly beans, places his hand on his gun butt.

Bob takes a drink of Minnie's famous coffy.

Joe Gage quietly removes the pistol from the holster on the side
of his hip. The cutie pie in the buckskins doesn't see this.

Ed all smiles and Minnie all eyes asks Bob;

MINNIE
Well, what'd ya' think?

Bob answers by taking out his pistol and shooting the surprised

Minnie and Ed many times (his shooting style is to fan the hammer
quick). Both Minnie and Ed hit the floor dead. Minnie's last pot
[~ of coffy still clutched in her hand, as she crashes to the floor.
Judy's head turns in the direction of the carnage.

Joe Gage raises his gun and Fires into Judy's shoulder,
blowing her across the room, and slamming her into a wood post.

Oswaldo removes his pistol from it's holster and Fires.

Shooting Gemma through the glass jar of jelly beans. She tumbles
from the ladder to the floor.

The Preacherman brings up his pistol and fanning the hammer shoots
Sweet Dave in his chair three times.

Judy shot in the shoulder, against the wood post. She looks across
to Joe Gage with a complete lack of understanding, but a big
question on her face.

He doesn't answer her questioning look, he just shoots her a
second time, this time more effectively. The bullet hits her
square in the chest, wiping away her questioning expression, and
spinning her hard to the floor.

Charly runs for the door.

Bob takes a pot shot at him, missing the boy, but hitting the lock
on the front door.

EXT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - MORNING
Charly runs out, trying to escape.

Bob steps outside, and Fires at Charly running away. The Bullet
hits Charly in the back, he plops down awkwardly in the snow.

INT - MINNIE'S HABERDASHERY - MORNING

The PREACHERMAN brings his pistol barrel against the temple of
Gen.Smithers, cocks back the hammer, and is just ready to go bang,
when suddenly Oswaldo appears in front of them.

OSWALDO
Hold it!

The PREACHERMAN looks at him.

OSWALDO
He's a nice touch.

The PREACHERMAN
Him?
a

OSWALDO
Him. He's authentic.

The PREACHERMAN
We can't trust this old fart.

OSWALDO
Sure we can, Jody. You just have to
convince him to trust us.

It seems The Preacherman's name is JODY.

OSWALDO
Without her or him
(meaning Minnie
and Sweet Dave)
this place is going to seem real empty.
He adds something. Not much. But something.
He makes the whole set up more convincing.

JODY
Okay, I'1l talk to the o1d man.
You and Grouch

(nickname for

Joe Gage)
start getting rid of the bodies.
Now don't try and bury nobody.
Just stack 'em on top of each other,
and shovel some snow on top of ‘em.

He goes over to the dead Sweet Dave, grabs him by his sweater,
and yanks him out of the chair on to the floor.

JODY
Start with him.

As Joe and Oswaldo move to get Sweet Daves body, Jody instructs;

JODY
Now stack 'em somewhere out back there.
Just not by the two places where people
go. The outhouse and the wood pile.
Francy.....(meaning Bob)
Start unhitching those horses and get
"em in the barn, and get ‘em fed. When
Ruth and Daisy get here, your gonna'
hafta' do it for them. After i get
through with this ole' hickory tree
(meaning Gen.Smithers)
i'11 come help ya'.

Oswaldo and Joe Gage carry out the dead bodies.

Bob goes outside to work on the horses.
Jody turns his attention to the old southern General.
oo
JODY
Okay General sir, what do they call you?

GEN. SMITHERS
Gen.Sanford Smithers.

JODY
No, that's what niggers and Johnny Rebs
call ya'. What does your wife call ya'?

GEN. SMITHERS
Sandy.

JODY
Well Sandy, if you was a cat, what just
happened here would count as one of your
nine lives. You realize how close you
came to being tossed on a pile of niggers?

GEN. SMITHERS
Yes.

JODY
And when it comes to that pile of
niggers we building out back, won't
(a take nothin' to make you General of it.
You believe that?

GEN. SMITHERS
I expect no less.

JODY
Well not so fast Sandy. You might have
way out yet.

Jody turns from the old man, and begins looking through some of
the trading post goods. Looking for and finding a blanket. As he
talks , he covers the blood stain on Sweet Daves chair with the
blanket.

JODY
Later today, a dirty son of a guns gonna
come in here. He's gonna’ have my sister
with him. He's gonna' have her in chains.
He's taking her into Red Rock to be hung.

He finds a few other skins and pelts, and tosses them across the
chair as well.

JODY
ro You know why? Ten thousand dollars,
that's why.
Jody sits in Sweet Daves chair, and continues explaining his plan
of action to the old officer.

JODY

(sits)
When he comes here i'm gonna’ kill that
fella', and i'm gonna' let my sister
loose. Now do you have any reason you'd
want to interfere with me saving my
sister from a hangman's rope?

GEN. SMITHERS
No.

JODY
You don't?

GEN. SMITHERS
No i don't.

JODY
Are you sure you don't? I mean we did
just kill Minnie and Sweet Dave. You
and Sweet Dave seemed pretty chummy there.

GEN. SMITHERS
I just met those people. I'm here about
my son. I don't give a damn about them,
or you, or your sister, or any son of
a bitch in Wyoming for that matter.

JODY
Good answer Sandy.

(beat )
So when they get here, you just sit your
ass in this chair. And you don't do
nothin', you don't say nothin'. Hello,
thank you, good night - that's about it.
- Maybe your name - but that's it.

GEN. SMITHERS
Hello, thank you, good night, maybe my
name.

JODY

Your starting to convince me, Sandy.

Be a old man. Be dotty. Go to sleep.

And don't say nothin', and i mean nothin',
to that bounty hunter got my sister.

You understand?

GEN. SMITHERS
Yes.
ro

JODY
Once it's safe, i kill him, free my
sister, and leave you be.

(holds out

hand)
Deal?

The Old Man shakes his hand.

GEN. SMITHERS
Deal.

Jody the outlaw leader takes his hand away from the old man, and
looks across at the general suspiciously.

JODY
Now you ain't playin' foxy grandpaw
with me now, are you?

GEN. SMITHERS

No.
JODY

I don't have a trusting nature, old man.
(beat)

But we'll give it a try.

He pats the old man's knee, and stands up.

While Bob pokes around in the kitchen, making himself familiar,
making coffy, Jody opens the door in the floor that leads to the
cellar. With a lantern in hand he goes down to investigate.

INT - CELLAR (MINNIE'S) - UNDERGROUND

Jody makes his way down in the dark cold cellar. He holds out his
lantern to look around.

It's short, he has to stoop, but it runs underground the length of
the bar area.

Goods like coffy, lamp oil, and corn meal are stored here.
Jody blows out the lantern to see how dark it is.

The light from the room above shines through the floorboards.
JOE and OSWALDO
come walking in from outside. And Jody can make out there figures
clearly from the room underneath them.

JODY

OSWALDO
We got trouble.

EXT - SNOWY MOUNTAIN TOP - MORNING

Oswaldo, Joe Gage, Bob, and Jody take a hike to a mountain top
clearing, and look down off the cliff to see what's coming at
them.

What they see looks like bad weather.

JODY
What's that?

OSWALDO
Having lived in Switzerland, i can tell
you exactly what that is. It's a blizzard.

JODY
A blizzard?

OSWALDO
Yes. We all got our problems. In England
we get a lot of rain. In Mexico it's
very hot. In Wyoming, you get blizzards.

JODY
Is it gonna' hit us for sure?
OSWALDO

FN Oh yes.

JODY
When?

OSWALDO
Some time tonight.

BOB
If there's a fucking blizzard coming we
can't stay in that shack!

JODY
‘Corse that place can stand a blizzard.
It probably sees "bout twelve blizzards
a year. If we hadn't killed Minnie and
her nigger menagerie, what would they do?
They'd hole up, that's what they'd do.

OSWALDO
I'm afraid i have to agree with my
Mon’ Amiee, here. We should move on to
Red Rock while we got the chance.

JODY
[~~ When it comes to the safest way of
disconnecting Daisy from that rattlesnake,

Anyone who don't wanna' brave a blizzard

Well now you put it that way.

Oswaldo BANGS the front door open.

OSWALDO
There coming up the hill!

JODY
Okay everybody, this is it, get ready!
Stash a coupla’ guns in case you need

Joe Gage tosses a table on top of another table face down.
Oswaldo does the same thing.

Both men hammer a nail into the underside of the table.

lan
BOB rips out the pages of a hard bound book, "The Three
Musketeers".

Joe takes the hammer and hits the pounded in nail on the side,
turning it into a hook.

Oswaldo does the same thing.

Bob places a pistol in the the covers of the hard bound Dumas book
on the bookshelf.

Joe turns the table back on it's legs. Then takes one of his
pistols, and hangs it underneath the table from the nail.

Oswaldo does the same thing.

Jody grabs a blanket and a bear skin, and heads for the cellar
door.

JODY

(to his men)
Remember, the name of the game is
patience. John Ruth, trapped here for
one or two days, at some point, will
close his eyes. If he feels he can close
his eyes. You hafta make him feel he can.
And when he does, that's when you blow
the top of his head off. If a moment
arises where he drops his guard...take
it...but be right.

The Stagecoach drives up outside.

Jody disappears in the cellar, closing the door in the floor
behind him.

Oswaldo pours himself some of Bob's freshly made coffy.

Joe slaps Bob on the back as he heads outside to deal with Daisy

gonna’ be a lot more reasonable.

As Maj.Warren and Chris get sucked into what Joe Gage says, and
what they say in response, Bob retrieves his pistol from the book
on the bookshelf. Nobodies sees him.

Oswaldo sits at the table he planted the gun at.

UNDERNEATH THE TABLE

Oswaldo takes the pistol off the nail hook, and slips it under his
winter coat.

Oswaldo stands up from the table, now well heeled.
ro

During the following exchange between mostly Joe Gage, Maj.Warren,
and Chris, Oswaldo and Bob start visibly duplicating "The Jody
Domergue Gang" plan of attack we witnessed earlier with Minnie and
her friends. Infiltrate and assassinate. The two Europeans take
their execution positions directly behind their intended targets.
In this case, Oswaldo behind Maj.Warren, and Bob behind Chris, as
Chris and Maj.Warren face Joe Gage at the table.

DOMERGUE
watches the members of her gang take their killing positions.

MAJ.WARREN
I'll tell ya' why John Ruth had to go.
Jordon Domergue can come down here, ten
men - fifteen - fifty no matter. He's
still gonna' find his sister handcuffed
to John Ruth, with John Ruth's pistol
barrel next to her belly. Jody Domergue
can bring a whole lotta’ pain. But he
can't do it before John Ruth kills his
sister.

CHRIS
And we can kill her just as quick.

JOE GAGE
But why? Look at ‘er!

Everybody turns and looks at her on the floor.
She's a fucking mess.

JOE GAGE
Your gonna' die, so he

(pointing at

Oswaldo)
can hang her?

“(pointing at

Daisy)
What the hell you care? It's simple,
you wanna' live, mind your own goddamn
fuckin’ business!

(pauses for

dramatic effect)
Here's the deal. Sun comes out, we're
gone.

(meaning him

and Daisy)
We meet up with her brother halfway, we go
back to Mexico. Addios America, Chihuahua
here we come. Y'all go on to Red Rock
and do whatever the hell it was you was
gonna' do before.
They all let his words stand.....

oN
cuT TO
INT - CELLAR - UNDERGROUND
Jody looks up through the floor, pistol in hand, waiting for their
reaction...
BACK UP TOP
Maj.Warren breaks the silence;
MAJ .WARREN
So we sit here all friendly like for the
next coulpa' days, then you all leave
here, go meet up with Jody, and all
y'all hightail it to Mexico? Right?
JOE GAGE
Yeah.
MAJ .WARREN
What 'bout that slug i put in her leg?
ro (to Domergue)

You are going to lose that leg, you know?

JOE GAGE
This only works if we're all reasonable.

MAJ .WARREN

(to Domergue)
So say i bump into you in a bar in Mexico?
Now your gonna’ be hoppin' around on one
leg, so i'll try not to bump into you too
hard. But when i do...One-Legged Domergue
....We're gonna' be friends?

(making fun

of her)
"Hey, remember that time back in Wyoming?
Boy that sure was cold wasn't it?"

(to Domergue)
Is it gonna’ be that way ‘tween us Daisy?
You ain't gonna' laugh as i die on this
mountain no more?

Domergue's look to him doesn't want to say fuck you, but it can't
help it.

Bob breaks the mood and concentration of the moment.

(™
os

He very convincingly says;

BOB

(to the room)
I don't want to die. I don't know any
of you people. I'm just taking care of
Minnie's. Like he said, when Sweet Dave
sees what i did to his chair, he's probably
going to throw me out. And i'm going to
get slaughtered by a bandit because of her?
About her or her brother, i don't give a
damn! But i'm going to die, no matter.

Oswaldo throws in his two cents.

OSWALDO

(to the men)
If you allow me, let me speak the
unhonorable truth. That my official
standing allows me to put in a convent
context to the dilemma at hand.
As the hangman in the area, i have a
route. That's why i'm here right now.
I'm making my rounds on my route. And
as of now, my rounds don't include her.
I've been hired to hang Lance Lawson.
The killer of Red Rocks previous Sheriff.
That's the hanging that Red Rock's waiting
for. Now this bloody saga that's going on
between John Ruth, and her and her brother,
is obviously long and involved. And also,
just as obviously, has nothing to do with
me. And while i don't mind dieing for my
saga, i don't wish to die for there's.

(pause for dramatic

effect)
So if we let them go once the sun comes
out, then i can travel to Red Rock
unmolested, and hang Lance Lawson, that's
the path i chose.

From this point on, Chris gets going and once he starts, he can't
stop. This is the point the actor playing Chris Mannix will have
to work himself up into a whirling dervish.

However while the whirling dervish officially starts here, his
first line barley makes a full rotation. When Chris speculates on
exactly how many men Jody Domergue has, it's as much to himself as
the room;
CHRIS
He's probably only got five or six at
most. My daddy lead a army. Mannix's
Marauders wasn't a goddamn gang! It was
a Renegade Army. A army is at least
fifteen men. But this fella's just a
owl hoot. if he's got six, he thinks
he's got a army.

Which is pretty good calculating on Chris' part, because The Four
Passengers and Daisy are all that's left of "The Jody Domergue

Gang".

BOB
But she said her brother has fifteen men?

CHRIS
She's a liar! Get that through your
thick skull! Her brother, his fifteen
men, that's all horseshit! Domergue is
what she's always been. A lien bitch who
will say anything to cheat that rope
waitin’ for her in Red Rock.

Maj.Warren challenges;

CHRIS EXPLODES;

MAJ .WARREN
What if it's true?
CHRIS
It ain't!
MAJ .WARREN
What if it is?
CHRIS
It ain't!!
MAJ .WARREN

What if it is?

CHRIS
THEN LET 'EM COME!!!

Major Warren smiles.

MAJ.WARREN
(to Chris)
I just wanted to hear you say that.
a

Chris moves over to Joe Gages table.

CHRIS

(to Joe)
John Ruth was one mighty mighty basterd.
But the last thing that basterd did
before he died, was save my goddamn life.

(beat)
You didn't. You were sitting there all
quiet like when i poured that cup.

(to Joe and

Domergue)
Both of you. Just watching me, waiting,
waiting for me to drink myself to death.
So what was the plan Joe Gage? I drink
the coffy, O.B. drinks the coffy, and
John Ruth drinks the coffy? And you two
sit around and laugh while we roll around
on the ground, holding our bellies,
screaming in pain?

JOE GAGE
When it came to you, as John Ruth told me
earlier, it wasn't personal.

Chris takes in his answer.

Then walks over to the pot belly stove, and grabs the poisonous pot
of coffy on it.

He takes the coffy pot, and a cup and walks over to Joe Gage's
table. He slams the cup down loudly on the table in front of Joe.
He pours the coffy in the cup from way up high, creating a long
stream of poison for everybody to see. When the cup gets messily
filled. Chris slams the coffy pot down on the table.

He takes his gun out and points it at the sitting Joe Gage.
COCK'S BACK the pistol's HAMMER....and says;

CHRIS
Drink it.

UNDERNEATH TABLE
Joe Gage takes the pistol in his grip, and points the barrel at
Chris's groin.

Oswaldo and Bob adlib protest, and get ready to pull their
weapons.

Maj.Warren stops the other fella's, he says;
MAJ .WARREN
Whoa boys.You weren't the one almost
poisoned, Chris was. So i say that makes
this Chris' say.

(meaning Domergue)
What do you say about her?

CHRIS
What about her?

MAJ .WARREN
Well, she's just guilty as him. What do
you say about her?

CHRIS
I say after he drinks the coffy and rolls
around on the floor screaming his guts
out. After we all have a good long enjoyable
look at that. We do with her what John Ruth
wanted.

(beat )
We hang her.

(pointing at

the ceiling)
From that beam right there.

Oswaldo and Bob adlib protest.

IN THE CELLAR

Jody places himself directly under Maj.Warren, gun pointed up
barrel of pistol aimed at the black man's balls.

BACK UP TOP

Chris looks to Maj.Warren, it's the taken the whole story, but
the two men have finally become compadres.

CHRIS
(to Maj.Warren)
And you know what else I say,
i say i don't care what they say.
(meaning Oswaldo
and Joe)
(to Maj.Warren)
What do you say?

Oswaldo and Bob trade looks, it's shootin’ time

MAJ.WARREN
I say, and i really can't believe i'm
saying this, Chris i agree with everything

you just said.
Oswaldo and Bob take out their pistols.

Insinctivley reacting to each others vibes, Both Maj.Warren and
Chris draw their guns, beating Bob and Oswaldo to the draw.

The Americans SHOOT The Europeans.

Maj.Warren shoots Oswaldo in the belly, the bullets pierce the
english man's stomach. The little man from Hammersmith rolls
around on the floor, holding his belly, screaming in pain as his
gastric juices are let loose through his intestinal tract.

Chris empties his pistol into Bob, shooting to pieces both The
Frenchman, and the front door he was standing in front of.

The broken door flies open, as the frigid wind blows through the
room.

Joe Gage stands up from the table with his pistol, fanning the
hammer he shoots both Chris and Maj.Warren in the back.

Maj.Warren and Chris both get two bullets each from Joe Gage's
gun. They arch their backs in reaction to the lead.
DOWN IN THE CELLAR

Jody fires his pistol up through the floor at Maj.Warren.

BACK UP TOP

The bullets from Jody's underground gun rip into Marquis Warren's
groin. He reacts.

DOMERGUE
watches.

MAJ.WARREN - SLOW MOTION
falls to the floor.

CHRIS ~ SLOW MOTION
falls to the fllor.

MAJ.WARREN - SLOW MOTION
falls to his knees, then forward catching himself on all fours on
the floor.

CHRIS - BACK TO 24 FRAMES
Mr.Mannix gets John Ruth's Winchester on the ground, and shoots
from the floor Joe Gage four times in rapid winchester secession.
JOE GAGE
torn apart by the bullets, falls to the floor.

DOMMERGUE

see's the gun that fell from Oswaldo's hand, lying on the floor
next to screaming english man with the belly ache. The desperate
woman makes a mad dash for the pistol. Dragging her arm and John
Ruth's dead body across the floor, slowly ...slowly...closer..
.-closer...

DOWN IN THE CELLAR

Jody looks up and can see the outline of Maj.Warren's body on all
fours above him. He fires into the ceiling, through the floor,
three times.

BACK UP TOP
all three bullets explode from underneath the wood floor and tear
into Maj.Warren's body, rolling him over on his back.

DOMERGUE
struggles for the pistol, drags John Ruth's dead body across the
floor....closer ....closer...to Oswaldo's gun.

CHRIS
grabs Bob's fallen pistol and fires at Jody straight into the
floor.

Chris and Jody exchange fire, one down into the floor, the other up
into the ceiling. Both take many hits.

DOMERGUE
getting closer and closer....almost there....

CHRIS & JODY
exchange fire, Jody falls back dead.

DOMERGUE

reaches Oswaldo's body, and with great ecstasy gets her fingers
around the pistol. She yanks it out, and finds Maj.Warren half way
across the floor, delirious and dieing. She fans the hammer,
shooting Maj.Warren three times. That did it. He falls back dead.

She whips around looking for Chris...and finds him....pointing the
winchester at her.

He shoots her four times from the floor in Winchester rapid
secession.

She's dead.
Chris Mannix who has five bullets in him, as the brutal wind whips
around the room, collapses.

Then on all fours he crawls across the room.

Grabs a big woolly Buffalo skin, wraps it around himself, and
falls/climbs into Minnie and Sweet Dave's big iron bed.

Where he rests, curls up, and waits to die.

As oswaldo continues to roll around on the floor, holding his
belly, screaming in pain.

The END
