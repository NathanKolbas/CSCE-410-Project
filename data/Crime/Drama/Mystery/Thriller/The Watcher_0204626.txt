Screenplay by

David Elliot

based on a story by

Darcy Meyers, David Elliot and Clay Ayers

Eighth Revised Draft
October 26, 1999
CLOSE ON -

A photo of a happy young woman at the beach. Her candid
expression suggests that she did not know she was being
photographed.

TRACK -- Off the picture, revealing that it is one of
many photographs of the same woman pasted onto a wall in
something of a collage of photos, newspaper clippings,
hand-written letters, and notes as well as eclectic
personal items (postcards, match books, birthday cards,
etc.).

The collage appears to be lit by candlelight.

In each photo she is either alone or the others in the
photograph have been roughly cut from the frame with
scissors. Though the woman appears attractive and happy,
there is something disturbing about the haphazard pasting
and cutting of the pictures.

As the frame tracks, glimpsed headlines read:

INQUIRY CLEARS AGENT OF NEGLIGENCE, INDEFINITE
LEAVE BEGINS; CHARRED REMAINS IDENTIFIED,
LINKED TO SERIAL KILLER; DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO
NINETEEN.

The frame tracks over crime scene photos -- a burned out
house surrounded by police and emergency vehicles; a shot
inside the same house (blackened walls and furniture); a
shot of a white sheet standing out in the middle of the
room; a closer shot of the same sheet, a human form
underneath; the sheet pulled back exposing a badly burned
body.

The frame has traveled full circle around the collage and
comes to rest again on the first picture of the young
woman.

With startling effect, a man's hand enters frame and
caresses the woman's cheek.

-BLACK-
FADE IN:

EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - NIGHT

The low moon illuminates the quiet lake. The beautiful
Chicago skyline glimmers in the distance. All is still
until-

From behind the skyline a WHIRRING mass of rotor blades
appears gradually closing in our position. Soon, three
F.B.I. helicopters BOOM past and continue on, sweeping
low across the water.

EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - CONTINUOUS

A dozen police vehicles scream through the streets of
Chicago.

Two motorcycle cops have blocked cross traffic and the
convoy races through the light.

When the convoy passes, the two motorcycles race back
past the convoy, ready to block the next intersection.

INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - CONTINUOUS

Spirited CUBAN MUSIC fills this expensively decorated and
trendy loft.

Windows compromise one whole wall of the room offering a
stunning view over the lake.

DAVID ALLEN GRIFFIN (35, handsome; despite his apparent
good mood, he has an eerie presence) suddenly dances into
frame.

He whirls and steps unselfconsciously to the feisty
rhythms, holding a heavy black automatic pistol in one
hand.

Mid-twirl he turns and addresses someone off camera.

GRIFFIN
Ooh. This song is faboo. Do
you feel that? The rhythm?
It's alive.
He dances, humming along with the song and occasionally
turning to look playfully at his image in a large three-
pane mirror as if he were flirting with an unseen
partner.

INT. F.B.I. COMMAND HELICOPTER: CONTINUOUS

The helicopter moves low and fast over a desolate expanse
of water.

Behind the COMMAND PILOT, several FEDERAL AGENTS gaze
soberly toward their destination.

ON THE COMMAND PILOT: His profile taut in the florescent
glow of his monitor.

The lights of Chicago disappear in the distance.

INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - CONTINUOUS

Griffin continues to dance for a moment before winding
his motion down gracefully as the song fades.

In the absence of music we hear for the first time the
sound of a WOMAN in the room quietly crying and
whimpering nearby.

The next SONG suddenly jumps to life on the CD player and
Griffin launches into another dance number, again humming
along.

EXT. COMMAND HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

HOVERING FOR A MOMENT high above the glittering water,
they PLUNGE toward their target.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Police vans and patrol cars screech to a lurching halt in
front of the warehouse.

The rear doors of the vans burst open and one after
another, COPS in riot gear pour out onto the pavement.
EXT. NEARBY ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

On the rooftop of a nearby building, there is a
tremendous build-up of police personnel.

A S.W.A.T. COMMANDER motions for his men to clear the way
as the three helicopters rise over the rooftop's ledge
and land in unison.

The federal agents duck the churning blade as they rush
into the nearest stairwell. Dozens of helmeted cops line
the roof's ledge.

VARIOUS ANGLES ON high-powered rifles, trained on the
warehouse.

INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - CONTINUOUS
AS a song ends, Griffin addresses someone off camera.

GRIFFIN
I don't know how you can just
sit there with music like this.
Such a waste.

INT. WAREHOUSE, FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

A small army pours into the building through every ground
floor entrance.

INT. WAREHOUSE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

A metal door crashes open as waves of S.W.A.T. officers
storm the darkened basement. As they advance, their red-
laser sights tracing a maze of pipes through the
cavernous basement.

S.W.A.T. OFFICER
(into his headset)
Basement's clear.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The agent in charge, MIKE IBBY (44, African American)
and several other AGENTS approach the building.
INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

A team of S.W.A.T. officers thunder up the metal fire
stairs.

INT. WAREHOUSE (DIFFERENT) STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

A second S.W.A.T. team races up a different stairwell.

INT. WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Another S.W.A.T. team kicks open a door to a loft,
scaring the hell out of COUPLE watching TV.

INT. WAREHOUSE, THIRD FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

A SECOND S.W.A.T. Officer hustles three terrified PEOPLE
down a dark hallway.

SECOND S.W.A.T. OFFICER
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

INT. WAREHOUSE, FIFTH FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

S.W.A.T. officers storm the hallway on the fifth floor
gathering at a door. The LEAD OFFICER nods and two
officers stand and ram the door down with a battering
ram.

FREEZE THE IMAGE. A voice is heard.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
It's never that easy. You go
through the door and they're
never just sitting there waiting
for you, a welcoming smile on
their face.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
JOEL CAMPBELL (late 30s, weary, scraggy, full beard,

baggy chords, a baseball cap) sits across from his
psychiatrist POLLY BEILMAN (37, attractive, poised).
CAMPBELL
The best we can do is hope they
fuck up and do what we can to be
there when they do.

POLLY
Do you blame yourself for the
killings?

CAMPBELL
No, I blame the asshole who did
them.

Polly almost cracks a smile.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
No. I don't blame myself for
not catching him, if that's what
you mean. This isn't a guy
whose been in and out of an
institution his whole life...

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET CORNER - DAY

A black and white cruiser has pulled over an older model
station wagon. TWO COPS walk up on either side of the
car.

As he approaches the driver, Cop #1 suddenly draws his
weapon. Cop #2 follows his lead.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
...whose brain finally pops and
he slaughters five people then
drives around in the family
station wagon till a cop sees
him run a red light.

The DRIVER raises his hands. Blood covers his face and
arms.

BLOODY GUY
Is there a problem, officer?
INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Back in the office.
CAMPBELL
This is a man whose whole life
is about killing. He studies
it. He knows forensics.

(MORE )

CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
He understands police procedure.
He prepares methodically so as
not to leave any evidence at the
scene.

INT. CORNER MARKET - EVENING

SHARON (attractive, 27) strolls through a local
deli/market with a hand basket full of groceries.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
He brings a kit with tools and
props. Duct tape, hand cuffs, a
weapon. Everything he'll need
for control, pleasure and
murder.

Anonymous POV of Sharon picking through a stack of
onions.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
He may watch her for weeks.

EXT. SHARON'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Sharon gets out of her parked car and walks, alone, down
the mostly deserted street in a middle-class
neighborhood.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
Learn her routine. When she
comes home, when she goes to
sleep.

A car drives slowly down the street past her and pulls
into a space. The lights go off.
EXT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

POV from outside the window looking in: Sharon prepares
herself breakfast in a very revealing outfit.
CAMPBELL (V.O.)
In the morning, before the sun
comes up, he can walk right up
next to her.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

POLLY
Why the morning?

CAMPBELL
Even though the sun's still
down, nobody perceives it as
night. Women that are very
careful at one a.m., will walk
around half naked four hours
later.

Polly makes a quick note on her notepad. Her expression
suggests that it's a note to herself to take care in the
mornings.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Finally, he’d pick a day.

INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT BUILDING, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Again a CU of a man's feet walking down a long corridor.
CU on man's hands as he first puts on a pair of latex
gloves, slips pair of cotton gloves over them, and then
picks the lock of an old doorknob.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
He'd let himself into her
apartment.

The lock clicks open and he pushes the door open.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sharon approaches her apartment door. She fumbles around
in her purse for her keys for a long time. Aftera
minute she gives up and starts to head back down the
hallway.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
That night she'd get home, go
about her business, unaware that
he was in the house.
She gets a few steps away and suddenly stops in her
tracks. She found the keys. She turns and lets herself
in.

INT. SHARON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The front door swings open, spilling light from the
hallway across the small living room. She closes the
door behind her and for a few seconds the apartment is
totally black. Her footsteps can be heard then BANG!
YELP!

She clicks on a light and rubs her shin. She bumped the
coffee table in the dark. She sets down her purse and
keys and heads down the dark hallway.

INT. SHARON'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
She steps into the bathroom and flips on the light.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
She might spend her last moments
alive in this world taking a
piss or feeding her cat.

INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sharon pushes open her bedroom door and flips on the
light and heads towards the closet, pulling her shirt off
as she walks.

Griffin stands behind the bedroom door, calmly. She
doesn't see him. She opens the closet door and begins to
rummage through her clothes.

Griffin pushes the bedroom door closed with a just
audible CLICK. Sharon slowly turns and sees Griffin
standing inside the closed bedroom door.

She yelps, covers herself with her hands and tries to run
but there's nowhere to go. She runs headlong into her
tiny closet, pulling down a bunch of her clothes,
literally trying to climb the walls.
INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sharon sits whimpering loudly on the sofa. She has duct
tape across her mouth and her feet are bound together
with her own stockings. Griffin stands nearby at a CD
rack browsing through her CDs. He takes out a CD and
puts it in.

GRIFFIN
Oh. Here we go. Shall we
dance?

Ballroom dance music suddenly pours out of the stereo.
He holds out his hand. Sharon sits, still totally
immobilized with fear. She begins to whimper a little
louder.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
Oh, don't play hard to get.
This'1ll be fun! Shhhhhhh.
Shhhhhhh.

He dances over to her and tries to pick her up but she
wails and her body goes limp, slipping out of his arms.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
Shhhhhhh.  Shhhhhhh.
(suddenly enraged)
I said SHUT UP!

She does.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

CAMPBELL
The torture would last hours.
Unimaginable terror.

Campbell notices that Polly looks uncomfortable.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
disturb you, I just-

POLLY
(snapping out of it)
No, no. Don't be sorry. This
is important for you, it's just
difficult sometimes.
CAMPBELL
Yeah, tell me about it.
(points to clock)
You're off the hook anyway.

She looks at the clock on her desk.

POLLY
(still composing
herself)
Yeah. I guess so. Okay, so
I'll see you next week.

INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Campbell lets himself into his apartment, a dark
unfriendly place. Books and magazines fill every
conceivable corner, making the place seem even smaller
than it is.

He tosses a hand-full of mail into a basket of similarly
unopened mail. The camera lingers on an unopened FEDERAL
EXPRESS envelope.

He tosses his jacket carelessly on the couch and crosses
the room to the bathroom.

INT. CAMPBELL'S BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

Campbell enters and washes his face, pulling his shirt
tail out. He opens a drawer and pulls out several
bottles of prescription medication, opens each one and
shakes out a couple pills.

He tosses them all into his mouth and takes a drink from
the faucet, swallowing them.

INT. CAMPBELL'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Campbell walks into the kitchen looking for food. All he
can find as a browning apple which he grabs and heads
back into:

INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

He picks up his keys (which have a Swiss army knife on
them) and a Victoria's Secret catalogue that came in the
mail and sits on the couch. He opens the knife and
begins peeling the apple and opens the catalogue,
obviously only half-interested in its contents.

The apple skin comes off in one long, spiral piece. He
sets it on the table and takes a bite of the apple.

He loses interest in the catalogue all together and
tosses it on the coffee table. He leans back and stares
toward the window, lost in thought.

TIME LAPSE - The light behind the window shade gradually
fades. Campbell still stares at the window until long
after dark.

INT. SHARON'S BATHROOM - DAY

Griffin stands in front of the mirror covered in blood
and sweat, exhausted from the ordeal of murder.

As he methodically cleans himself up, he addresses
himself in the mirror, though he seems to be talking to
someone else, the way one might speak to a deceased loved
one.

GRIFFIN
Where did you go? I wonder what
happened to you that night?
Why was it so different from the
other times? I don't know why
you were there, how you got so
close to me that night.

He bends over and washes his face.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
But I remember clearly what I
felt when I heard your footsteps
falling behind me... Pride. For
me it was our finest hour. I
thought it would keep us
together forever. I can still
see the flames...

EXT. BURNING HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Deep black smoke pours from several broken windows. The

orange flicker of fire light can be seen behind several
other windows.
Campbell (younger) gun in hand, sprints down a dark
deserted alley toward the house. Though he runs as hard
as he can, in dreamlike fashion he doesn't seem to making
very much progress.

CUT TO:

Campbell running up the back staircase and into the back
door, immediately ducking away from the rush of flames
and heat.

He covers his mouth with his arm and pushes into the back
hallway.

INT. BURNING HOUSE, BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK

A WOMAN'S hideous SCREAMS of agony and fear. Campbell
pushes further down the crumbling hallway, dodging
burning debris that falls around him. His progress is
impeded by thick smoke that blurs what's happening. He
can just make out the image of a woman sitting in a chair
in a room at the end of the hallway.

She SCREAMS again, a long piercing howl.

The camera focuses in on a wall of flames until it fills
the entire frame.

Images of horrible prime scenes begin to appear
superimposed over the flames: horribly mutilated bodies,
pools of blood, bloody clothes, murder weapons. The
scream continues throughout until-

-CAMPBELL WAKES WITH A JOLT IN

INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

He bolts up right on the couch, covered in sweat, his
face distorted with pain. His moves are frantic and
jerky.

He grips his hands over his eyes and stumbles towards the
bathroom but can't keep his feet.

HIS POV: the room blurs and the floor seems to buckles
as he CRASHES onto the hard wood.
He writhes in agony, kicking the walls and pressing both
hands against his temples as if to stem the pain.

INT. CAMPBELL'S BATHROOM - MORNING

He finally gets it together enough to make it to the
bathroom, frantically dumping out drawers and throwing
open cabinets.

Campbell slumps into the floor. HIS DISTORTED POV: as
he paws at a pile of drugs and toiletries that lay
sprawled across the floor. His hand finds a
pharmaceutical carton and he tears it open with his
teeth.

He pulls the rubber protective tip from a small syringe
and plunges into his thigh (which is badly marked and
scarred from many similar occasions).

He pulls out a second syringe and repeats the process.
He drags himself the rest of the way into the bathroom
and throws up violently into the toilet.

INT. CAMPBELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Again, it's night time. Campbell stirs awake. He's been
on the floor the whole day. He stands up and washes his
mouth out.

INT. CAMPBELL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Campbell enters the kitchen and opens the refrigerator.
Nothing. He slams it closed and checks the cupboard but
the cupboard's dry. He closes it as well.

EXT. CAMPBELL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Campbell walks out his front door and down the street
toward a Chinese Restaurant across the street. He looks
haggard. We follow from an ANONYMOUS POV.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Campbell sits in the middle of the mostly empty
restaurant near the front window, eating his dinner with
chopsticks. He does not notice several police cruisers
that pass the front of the restaurant with their lights
on.

Again someone watches from across the street. Campbell
seems miserable and very much alone.

EXT. CAMPBELL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell steps out of the restaurant and is surprised by
the sight of an active crime scene in front of his
building. Campbell walks up and stands with a CROWD of
onlookers. COPS and PARAMEDICS pass this way and that.
After a moment, Campbell ducks the police tape and slips
unnoticed into the front door of the building.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Campbell ducks another line of tape and into the hallway.

LIEUTENANT HOLLIS MACKIE (33, Southern twang and a bad
haircut) stands in the hallway talking to some COPS. He
sees Campbell.

HOLLIS
Hi. Welcome to my crime scene.
Can help you or are you just
looking?

CAMPBELL
(pointing at the
stairwell)
I just live here.

HOLLIS
(stepping in his path)
Did you not see the bright
yellow tape that said 'Do Not
Cross' on it?

Campbell holds up his wallet, showing Hollis his ID.

CAMPBELL
(weary)
Can I just go upstairs? I don't
feel like arguing with you.

Hollis looks at the ID for a moment then shouts down the
hallway.
HOLLIS
Emelda!

Hollis calls her over with a quick nod.

HOLLIS (CONT'D)
Got a picture?

EMELDA (a young Hispanic cop) hands it over. Hollis
hands the picture of Sharon to Campbell.

The photo (probably found in Sharon's apartment) is taken
at her high school graduation.

HOLLIS (CONT'D)
Do you know this woman?

CAMPBELL

Never seen her. What happened?
She dead?

HOLLIS
(suddenly very suspicious)
We didn't say anything about a
homicide... Mister...
(looking at the ID)
Campbell. Now why would you
jump to that conclusion?

CAMPBELL
Oh, I'm just real insightful.
You got half the block taped off
and there's a dozen cops in my
lobby. What conclusion should I
jump to, that someone stole her
stereo?

Campbell heads toward the stairs.

HOLLIS
Wait. Call me if you think of
anything?

Campbell turns back around. Hollis walks over and hands
him a card. Campbell turns around and heads up the
stairs.
INT. CAMPBELL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Campbell sits on the bed watching the Home Shopping
Network holding a half-glass of Jack Daniels. He looks
miserable.

CU on a man's hand holding a faux diamond necklace.

TV SALESMAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
(from the TV)
This cubic zirconium necklace is
perfect for her birthday,
anniversary, or Christmas
present.

INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Downstairs, a PHOTOGRAPHER flashes shot after shots of
Sharon. Off the last flash, the screen flashes entirely
white.

EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING

A sweeping vista of Chicago in the first light of day.

INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Campbell eats cereal and rifles through an enormous pile
of unopened mail. Bills, junk mail, nothing interesting.
He gets to a Fed Ex envelope and tears it open and shakes
out the contents. A single 8'x 10' black and white
photo.

CU a photograph of Sharon, last night's victim, sitting
alone in a what appears to be a small restaurant - still
alive.

Campbell stands and quickly rummages through an enormous
pile of unopened mail and unread newspapers and magazines
near the front door, finally pushing the dumping a small
table onto the floor. He finds what he's looking for:
Another unopened Fed Ex envelope. He rips it open and
another black and white photo slips out. It's a picture
of a different woman driving alone in a her car. It's
taken from a car moving alongside her.
INT. HOLLIS' CAR - CONTINUOUS

ON THE CUT: a cell phone RINGS just as Hollis swerves
violently through traffic nearly killing himself and
twenty others. He's in pursuit of a Honda Accord that
just made a quick left. His police radio SQUABBLES
almost as loud as the TIRES of his car.

After he fishtails around the corner and down shifts,
quickly gaining his lost ground on the Honda, he answers
the phone.

HOLLIS
(surprisingly calm)
Lieutenant Mackie.

INTERCUT WITH CAMPBELL'S APARTMENT;

Campbell jerks his head away from the receiver, startled
by the SCREAMING tires, engine ROAR, and blaring SIRENS.

CAMPBELL
(loudly over the
noise)
This is Joel Campbell. We met
last night.

HOLLIS

(driving insanely)
Campbell. Sure, sure. Our ex-
F.B.I. friend from apartment
805.

(answering the unasked

question)
We did some checking after you
left last night. What can I do
for you?

Hollis almost runs down four PEDESTRIANS, locking up all
four tires just long enough to miss them, then punching
the gas again. He doesn't even flinch. Several police
cruisers have joined the chase.

CAMPBELL
(truly perplexed)
What are you doing?

HOLLIS
(still totally calm)
Some asshole just jacked a Honda
two blocks from me.
CAMPBELL
Well, shit, do you need to call
me back?

HOLLIS
(wrenching the wheel)
No, I'm fine. You got something
for me?

CAMPBELL
(still very loud)
When'd she die?

HOLLIS
(still driving insanely)
Monday night. Three days ago.
Why?

CAMPBELL
Cause I know who did it.

HOLLIS
And how might you know that?

CAMPBELL
Because he mailed me a picture
of her still alive. Got it
three days ago. Monday morning.

HOLLIS
(blown away, almost happy)
No shit!?

Several patrol cars suddenly cut off the Honda and it
skids to a halt. Two Asian YOUTHS jump out and flee on
foot.

HOLLIS (CONT'D)
Campbell, hold on a sec. Team
Honda here's on the run.

Hollis jumps out of his car and chases one of the kids,
still holding his cell phone. After a short sprint,
Hollis has closed the gap. He tackles the kid, dropping
his cell phone, and the two of them skid along the dirty
pavement. The phone slides ten feet away. A UNIFORM
jumps on the kid and cuffs him.

Hollis walks over and picks up the cell phone
HOLLIS (CONT'D)
(back into the phone)
Meet me at my office?

INT. DETECTIVE MACKIE'S OFFICE - MORNING

Hollis looks at a picture of Sharon (which is now ina
plastic evidence bag). Campbell sits across the desk.

HOLLIS
You always open your mail four
days after you get it?

Campbell tosses Hollis the second picture (also in
plastic).

CAMPBELL
No, sometimes it takes up to two
weeks.

HOLLIS

I guess that answers any
question we might of had whether
the two cases were related. Oh,
boy, my first serial.

CAMPBELL
Glad your having fun with this.

HOLLIS
(laughing)
Are you kidding? He's sending
us pictures, Campbell! Call Bob
Barker! It's a fucking game
show.

CAMPBELL
(moving on)
Strangled with piano wire?
Victim was partially unclothed
but the swabs all came back
negative?

HOLLIS
Exactly. No touchy, no feely.
What's going on?

CAMPBELL
His last known alias is David
Allen Griffin. We attribute at
least 11 homicides to him. I
worked him for three and half
years. In L.A. All I ever got
was a cast on a pair of nine and
half Nikes.

HOLLIS
In L.A.? What the hell's he
doing in Chicago?

CAMPBELL
Killing people, looks like.

HOLLIS
(holding up the
picture)
He ever come after you before?

CAMPBELL
No, he's never sent pictures or
contacted me directly before.

HOLLIS
So it's not necessarily the same
guy?

CAMPBELL

Are you seri-? He sent mea

picture and then killed her in

my own fucking building.
(snapping in his face)

Try to keep the pace, man, this

is serious.

HOLLIS
(whistles)
Three and half and a pair of
Nikes, huh?
(Campbell stands)
Bureau's involved now, I assume?

CAMPBELL
Safe assumption.

Campbell stands up.

F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Campbell walks down a long corridor led by MIKE IBBY (44,
African American).
IBBY
I just got off the phone with
your ex-boss in L.A. He sends
his best.

Campbell doesn't respond.

IBBY (CONT'D)
He told me you were a good
agent. Great instincts. Told
me you know this animal better
than anyone else.

CAMPBELL
It's not my job anymore.

IBBY
He and I both think maybe it
should be. We're setting up a
task force with Chicago P.D.
I'd like you to lead it from our
end. We can reactivate-

CAMPBELL
(stopping in his
tracks)
The field office in L.A. has the
relevant files. I can't tell
you anything that's not in them.
Have a nice day.

Campbell turns to walk away just as AGENT MITCH CASPER
(young, almost boyish-looking) exits his office.

MITCH
(ignoring Campbell, to
Ibby)
We got several sets of prints
from the Fed-Ex envelope.

Campbell half turns around as he walks out.

CAMPBELL
You can run ‘em but you're going
to get the delivery boy, the
receptionist, three guys from
the warehouse, Santa Clause,
everyone but him. You're going
to have to do much better than
that.
Ibby and Mitch look at Campbell, vaguely annoyed at his
comment. Campbell turns and walks out.

INT. SNAP! 1HR. PHOTO - AFTERNOON

Snap! 1HR. PHOTO is a small store in a very busy indoor
shopping mall, though the store itself is deserted.

ELLIE (24, mousy), sits behind the counter making faces
into a Sony Digital Video camera that broadcasts her
image onto several monitors in the store.

She sticks out her tongue; blows a bubble; makes a fish
face, etc., clearly bored.

INT. FOX PAVILION SHOPPING MALL - AFTERNOON

Dozens of shoppers cross this way and that, no one paying
attention to the others. After a moment, we see Griffin,
making his way toward Snap.

INT. SNAP! 1HR. PHOTO - AFTERNOON

Griffin walks in and catches Ellie making faces. She
smiles apologetically.

ELLIE
Sorry.

GRIFFIN
That's quite alright. You
looked adorable.

Ellie blushes. Griffin walks up to a display and pulls a
roll of Kodak film off the rack.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
This new Kodak film stock, it
says it's for exterior sunshine,
but how's it handle
Fluorescents?

Ellie shrugs and throws up her hands.
ELLIE
(laughing at herself)
I'm sorry, I have no idea what
you're talking about.
(shrugs again)
I just work here.

Griffin smiles at her and looks up at the ceiling:
Fluorescent lighting.

GRIFFIN
Do you guys process here, as
well?

ELLIE

Yeah. One hour.

Griffin tears open the film and picks up a display camera
on the counter. He opens the back of the camera.

GRIFFIN
May I?

ELLIE
Sure, but what are you doing?

Once the film is loaded, he raises the camera and points
it at Ellie.

GRIFFIN
I'm going to test it out.

He clicks a picture of her. She laughs.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
I'll shoot a few pictures and
you can process them for me.

He clicks another picture of her. She laughs again, this
time making a face at his camera. He clicks another.
She's clearly enjoying the attention. He clicks several
more.

INT. POLLY'S OFFICE - DAY
Campbell, looking more and more haggard and distraught

each time we see him, sits across from Polly in her posh
office.
POLLY
You're a young man, do you plan
to live on disability your whole
life?

Campbell holds out his arms and surveys himself,
implicitly inviting her to do the same.

CAMPBELL
I take 150 milligrams of seconal
so I can sleep two and half
hours a night. You want lives
in my hands? Acebutolol and
benazepril for blood pressure, I
self inject migrainol and
imitrex for migrain -

POLLY
You're simply afraid-

CAMPBELL
I go places and forget why I'm
there. I miss exits on the
freeway. You want lives in my
hands? I'm lucky to find my way
home from the grocery store.

POLLY
You're simply afraid that you'll
make another bad judgment that
you won't forgive yourself for
and you're avoid-

CAMPBELL
(almost shouting)
Absolutely! I'm avoiding that
situation. No, I don't trust
myself. Would you?

POLLY
Then why do you come here?
What's the point of these
sessions? Are you trying to get
well so you can get out on the
golf course next spring?
CAMPBELL
If the next picture that arrives
were of your daughter would you
really want me to be the one
looking for her? Would you
really?

POLLY
(thinks for a beat)
Yes. Yes I would.

He stands up, unwilling to listen, and heads for the
door.
POLLY (CONT'D)
Don't walk out now. This is
exactly what you want. You have
to admit that. Right now is the
time.

He slams the door in her face. She throws her note down
in exasperation.

INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Campbell sits watching footage of the crime scene on the
late news. A reporter stands outside Ellie's house.

FEMALE REPORTER
The harrowing search came to a
tragic end at about 9:20 p.m.
when police discovered the body
of Ellie Buchner at her Wicker
Park home.

Campbell punches the remote and the screen goes to black.

EXT. GRAY COLONIAL STYLE HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Campbell (younger, clean-shaven) walks up to the front
porch of the house, careful not to be seen or heard.

He peers under the blinds into a window. Through the
thick leaded glass his POV is distorted. A figure moves
in the living room.

Several candles provide the only light in the room.
Campbell pulls away and looks through another window,
trying to get a better idea of what's happening.
From the second window he can see a woman bound and
gagged. His breath quickens. He stands and kicks the
front door in and-

-WAKES UP SUDDENLY IN HIS LIVING ROOM

Campbell sits up in his EZ chair, apparently having
fallen asleep in the chair. It's daylight. He looks at
the clock: 6:40.

EXT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - MORNING

Campbell walks down the sidewalk. P OV from someone
following him a few feet behind.

Campbell heads toward the front door of Polly's building.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, LOBBY DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Campbell crosses the polished granite floor of the
expansive lobby and heads toward a bank of elevators. He
chooses an elevator and enters.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Campbell punches his floor and leans against the wall.
The door starts to close but at the last second opens
again.

Griffin steps in. Griffin punches the same floor as
Campbell and the two ride in silence, not looking at each
other. Campbell yawns. He looks rather haggard froma
night of little sleep.

GRIFFIN
Long night?

Campbell nods. They ride up the rest of the way in
silence.

EXT. POLLY'S FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell steps into the hallway and Griffin steps out
behind him. Campbell walks down the hallway, Griffin
right behind him. He comes to a fork in the hallway and
takes the left corridor.
Campbell follows. Griffin grins.

GRIFFIN
Are you following me?

CAMPBELL
I could ask you the same
question.

They share a small laugh and keep heading down the
hallway soon arriving at Polly's door.

Campbell slows and for instant it seems as if Griffin is
going to stop too but he doesn't. He walks down the hall
and Campbell ducks inside.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - LATER
Campbell sits fidgeting in a chair across from Polly.

CAMPBELL
I don't have time to be here but I appreciate what you
said last week and didn't want you to think that I was
walking away for the wrong reason.

POLLY
(she smiles)
How have the headaches been?

CAMPBELL
About the same.

POLLY
Are you sleeping?

CAMPBELL
Some.

POLLY

How's work?

CAMPBELL
It's great. I'm getting so
popular, I've got murders
requesting me by name.
POLLY
Let's talk about that. How are
you making sense of this man
following you here? Is ita
vendetta?

CAMPBELL

(after a moment)
I don't think vengeance has
anything to do with it. There's
a story, a ritual, in this, that
he follows. Over the years, I
became part of the story. It
didn't make sense without me.

POLLY
In other words, he missed you.

CAMPBELL
Odd isn't it?

POLLY
I don't know. Did you miss him?

CAMPBELL
What do you mean?

POLLY
Well the description you just
gave could apply to you, don't
you think?

Campbell is taken aback, unsure if he's ready to concede
her this point. After a moment, his phone rings.

CAMPBELL
Excuse me.
(into the phone)
Campbell.

MITCH (0.S.)
Got a match on the prints.

CAMPBELL
I'll be right there.
INT. CAMPBELL'S OFFICE - MORNING

Campbell, Ibby, and Mitch sit in Campbell's office.
Campbell reads from a file folder. Mitch looks wrecked.
He's been here all night.

CAMPBELL
Norton Inglert. Vagrancy 1987.
Vagrancy 1991. I.Q. estimated
at below eight zero which makes
him officially... not Griffin.

IBBY
Let's pick him up. You got a
last known address?

CAMPBELL
Yeah, a by-the-hour-motel where
he stayed eight years ago.
Mitch get some sleep. Diana,
you wanna ride?

INT. CAMPBELL'S CAR - AFTERNOON
Campbell drives; Diana sits in the passenger seat.

DIANA
The report came in from the
camera shop. Lots of prints
everywhere. The lab's running
them to see if anything
interesting turns up.

CAMPBELL
It won't. He’d have been more
careful than that. If he
touched anything he’d have wiped
it clean. Anyone see anything?

DIANA
Nope. There was one fun bit,
though. He filled out the
photo-order with your name and
address.

Campbell cringes. She smiles.
EXT. DINGY MOTEL, DOWNTOWN - LATER

A disaffected clerk sits smoking behind the counter
watching TV. CU on the TV as a day-time
TALKSHOW HOST stands in front three GUESTS.

HOST
There's five million people in
this city! How can nobody have
known this poor girl? How can
this happen in the age of
communication with emails, fax,
phones-

GUEST #1
(pompous )

On the contrary, Maggie. It
could have only have happened in
this age. These tools of
communication allow us to
function as a society with less
and less real human interaction.

Campbell and Diana enter. The clerk doesn't even look
up.

CAMPBELL
(showing a photo)
Surprise me. Tell me, that
Norton Inglert still stays here.

MOTEL CLERK
(glance at the photo)
Norton Inglert. Nope.

DIANA
Would fifty bucks make him more
likely to be here?

MOTEL CLERK
For fifty bucks I'd tell you
Elvis' got a room by the pool
and gives a free concert
Thursday nights but that don't
make it so.

He turns back to the TV.
GUEST #2 (0.S.)
I couldn't agree more with Don.
A hundred years ago, she would
have been living in a single
structure with her parents,
brothers and sisters, cousins...

Back to the TV. Campbell and Diana split.

HOST

That's true, but I tell you
what, it still irks me!

(then pointing to the

camera and smiling)
Next, after this, we take your
calls! We have hundreds of
calls waiting and we'll see how
Many we can get through!

INT. CAMPBELL'S CAR - AFTERNOON

Campbell drives with Diana. His phone rings.

CAMPBELL
Campbell.

HOLLIS
What up 'C'? I found your
retard.

CAMPBELL
Where?

HOLLIS

I'll meet you. Off the record,
though. Just me and you. My
guy's still undercover.

EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

Campbell and Hollis stand on the dock with JACK FRAY (35,
long hair, leather jacket).
JACK
So check it out. Last year we
were getting close to the
Russians. We nailed this
asshole with a pocket of rocks
and next thing we know he's a
first class U.S. citizen. He
gives up everyone he knows and
makes up a few others for
effect.

CAMPBELL
So?

JACK
So most of them are worthless.
We haven't even used them.
Don't want to blow our own
cover. But one of the names was
a retard name of Norton they
used as a drug mule.

CAMPBELL
You got an address?
JACK
Not on the mule, but here's the

rat.

He hands Campbell a folder. He
snaps it back.

JACK (CONT'D)
You understand if this gets on
the street we could lose lives?

Campbell nods and takes the folder.

CAMPBELL
(reading)
Stanislaw Mikahailovich.
Possession. On Probation.
Current address 859 West
Washington.

JACK
Be careful, boys. He's a pussy.
But he's a crazy pussy.
EXT. CAMPBELL'S CAR - LATER

Campbell and Hollis step quietly from Campbell's car.
The guys gaze across and up the street at a dark house
with six-foot weeds in the yard and plywood over the
windows.

EXT. STANISLAW'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell and Hollis stalk quietly up to the front door.
Campbell kneels to the left of the door, Hollis to the
right. Campbell nods. Hollis bangs loudly on the front
door. Hollis bangs again and leans back down away from
the door.
VOICE (0.S.)
(strong Russian
accent)
Who is it!?

HOLLIS
Police! Open the door.
(then as an aside to
Campbell)
Oh, sorry, Campbell.
(shouting again)
The F.B.I. is here too!

VOICE (0.S.)
What you want?!

HOLLIS
We're selling tickets to the
Policeman's ball, douche bag.

BLAM! BLAM! Campbell hits the porch when the door
partially disintegrates as Stanislaw blasts two rounds
through it. Hollis shrugs, stands up, and kicks the rest
of the door in. Campbell makes a circle with his index
finger, and slinks off the porch.

INT. STANISLAW'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

It's pitch black. Hollis walks inside.

BLAM! BLAM! The house lights up as someone unloads from
down the hallway. Hollis doesn't even bother to duck.
HOLLIS
Okay, asshole. Stop shooting.
You can't even see me. How
you're going shoot me?

BLAM! The house flashes brightly again. Hollis walks
down the hall, right towards the gunman.

BLAM! BLAM!

HOLLIS (CONT'D)
(shouting)
Cut that shit out or I'm gonna
shoot your ass.

BLAM! Click. The sound of the hammer against loud
footsteps can be heard rustling around the back of the
house as the guy makes a run for it. Hollis runs through
the rest of the house.

EXT. STANISLAW'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Hollis bursts out the back door just in time to see
Stanislaw fly end-over-end as Campbell clunks him in the
shin with a two-by-four. Hollis laughs heartily.

INT. STANISLAW'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Campbell and Hollis interrogate Stanislaw who sits cuffed
to a dinette chair in the middle of his living room. He
sits in his boxer shorts. Hollis holds a fat copy of the
Chicago white pages.

HOLLIS
(casually)
500 North Carmine Avenue? Is
that it?
STANISLAW

(heavy accent)
You can't just come in here when
you want to whenever! I have
immunity! So fuck you!

Hollis flips the book closed and thumps Stanislaw back
and forth across the face with it a couple times -- not
too hard, just enough to shut him up and get his
attention.
HOLLIS

Listen, Standi- Stamis-, uh,
listen, Coleslaw, we know the
address is in here.

(he opens the book again)
And we're going to stay right
here until you tell it to us.
5789 Rountree Drive? That it?

STANISLAW
Fuck off.

Thump. Thump. Thump. Stanislaw's eyes dart around as
the intimidation sets in. He looks like an unwilling
participant in a Three Stooges skit. Thump. Thump.

HOLLIS
(again looking at the
book)
413 Broadway?

Stanislaw hesitates. Thump. Thump. Thump.

Campbell laughs, then suddenly picks Stanislaw up and
shoves him against the wall.

CAMPBELL
"From each according to his
ability, to each according to
his needs.' You understand
that? Isn't that Kremlin
rhetoric? Now you see, we need
some information and you have
the ability to give it to us.

STANISLAW
(giving up)
Okay, okay. Alright, here it
is, alright? He used to work at
a fucking laundry mat, alright?

CAMPBELL
Where?

STANISLAW
On East Elm near the lake,
alright? Near the fucking lake.
Whatta I give a shit about some
fucking retard?
EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING

The sun rises over the cityscape.

EXT. LAUNDROMAT, ALLEY WAY - MORNING

Two unmarked cop cars pull up to the rear entrance of the
laundromat. There's a truck parked at the back door and
its cargo door and the back door to the laundromat are
open.

Plainclothes COPS step out of the car and loiter nearby,
waiting. Campbell and Hollis walk casually up to the
door.

As they approach, the OWNER walks out from the back
carrying an enormous canvas bag of laundry on his
shoulder.

LAUNDROMAT OWNER
(dropping the bag)
Can I help you?

CAMPBELL
(showing badge)
Special Agent Campbell, F.B.I.
This is Lieutenant Mackie,
Chicago Police.

HOLLIS
(showing a picture)
Does Norton Inglert still work
here?

LAUNDROMAT OWNER
Yes he does and he's a good kid.
I don't know what-

CAMPBELL
Do you have an address?

LAUNDROMAT OWNER
Of course, but he's a good kid.
Whatever it is you guys-

CAMPBELL
The address? Now.

The owner turns to walk inside.
EXT. LAUNDROMAT - MOMENTS LATER

Hollis stands talking on his car radio. Campbell stands
within earshot. Hollis reads from a small note pad.

HOLLIS
4240 Crossbend Avenue. Surveil
only! Do not go inside!
Surveil only! Nobody inside
until I get there.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - MORNING
Polly sits at her desk talking to a patient.

POLLY
Usually, Mr. Abraham, I do an
introductory session where we
explore what you hope to get out
of therapy. If we both feel
like I'm the person to provide
that for you then we'll decide
on a schedule together.

Cut back to reveal that it is Griffin that she's talking
to.

She sets the tape recorder between them. Griffin takes
note of the recorder.

POLLY (CONT'D)
I like to record my sessions.
But if you prefer for me not to-

GRIFFIN
Is that something that you do
with all of your patients?

POLLY
With most. Do you prefer that I
don't?

GRIFFIN

No. I'd rather you not.

POLLY
Okay.... that's fine.
She puts the recorder away.

EXT. NORTON'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell arrives and jumps out. The place is surrounded
with COPS and Norton is already in custody, sitting
handcuffed and very frightened in the back seat of a
cruiser. The car is about to pull away. Campbell runs
toward it, flagging it down.

CAMPBELL
Hey! Hey! What the fu-

The DETECTIVE IN CHARGE jumps in the way.
DETECTIVE IN CHARGE
(getting in his face)
Who the hell are you?

Campbell shoves the detective out of his way and he
slips, falling to one knee. He pops back up angrily and
shoves Campbell. They eye each other dangerously.

HOLLIS
Hey! Hey! Back the fuck up!
We're on TV here people.

He points to a camera crew and reporter that have just
arrived, camera rolling.

DETECTIVE IN CHARGE
(dismissively)
I had to make a decision,
Lieutenant, he was on the move.
I had to make a decision.

CAMPBELL
Bullshit. The only decision you
made was whether or not to be a
hero in the biggest case this
city's seen in decades and we
know which way you came out on
that, you fucking prick.

HOLLIS
(still holding them apart)
Campbell, let's go to the
district office, you can talk to
him there.
DETECTIVE IN CHARGE
(laughing, cocky)

There's not much left to talk
about. Franklin found a shirt
with blood on the sleeves and
the fucking loony couldn't
confess fast enough. You should
of seen it, Hollis, he's
blabbing away and I'm in his
face trying to read his Mirandas
fast enough to use the Goddamn
confession.

Campbell and Hollis turn and walk away.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY
Griffin continues his session with Polly.

POLLY
You said you felt like you might
need help. In what area?

GRIFFIN
I'm not sure. What kind of help
do you provide?

POLLY
Ahhhhhhh. Well, I work with
patients on many different

issues-

GRIFFIN
I don't like when you say
"issues'. It just bothers me.

Don't do that.
(she's taken aback by
this)
Do you think some of your
patients might pay to come see
you because you're very pretty?

POLLY
(trying to regain
control)
Mr. Abraham let's try to keep
focused on you rather than me...

It is clear that she does not like her newest patient.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Campbell sits across from Norton, who is quite scared.

CAMPBELL
Norton, I know that you're
afraid, but I'm trying to help
you.

NORTON
(growing more upset)
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

CAMPBELL
Why don't you tell me what
you're sorry for? Did you hurt
her?

NORTON
I looked at her.

Norton grows very shy.

CAMPBELL
Norton, did she see you look at
her?

NORTON
No.

CAMPBELL

How'd the blood get on your
sleeves, Norton? Did you touch
her?

EXT. ROOM ADJACENT TO THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hollis and several OTHERS are watching from behind the
glass.

NORTON
Yeah.

CAMPBELL
Did you hurt her when you
touched her?
NORTON
I don't know.

CAMPBELL
Did she scream or tell you to
stop touching her?

NORTON
No. She was asleep.

CAMPBELL
(to the mirror)
Impressive work, guys. Norton,
listen to me. You're not going
to be in trouble anymore.

Norton doesn't respond.
CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Norton, did you see someone else
hurt her? Did you see someone
else at the apartment?

After a long moment, Norton nods his head 'yes'.
Campbell sits up excitedly.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Okay, Norton, I want to play a
little game with you now, okay?
We're going to try to drawa
picture of the man you saw.

Just then JACKSON (the D.A.) and MENDEL (a defense
attorney) burst into the interrogation room with Hollis
and two UNIFORMS at their heels.

MENDEL
This interrogation is over!

Campbell stands. Norton cowers away from the commotion.

CAMPBELL
Who the hell are you?

MENDEL
I'm his attorney.

CAMPBELL
It wasn't an interrogation to
begin with. Hollis, we gotta
get a sketch artist in here. He
saw the guy.
MENDEL

No we don't 'gotta' do anything.

(to the uniforms)

Escort this man back to his
cell.

The cops grab Norton by the arms and lift him out his

chair.

No,

CAMPBELL
no, no. He may have seen

the guy kill her. He'sa
peeping Tom, that's all. He
must of touched her body. For
Godsakes, I'm trying to help him
here.

Oh,

MENDEL
(sarcastic)
we're sure you are, Agent

Campbell. And we appreciate
that.

Campbell looks to Hollis who shrugs. Norton has already
been led out of the room.

EXT. DISTRICT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell and

Hollis stand outside the district office.

HOLLIS

Let me talk to his lawyer. I
know a guy who knows a guy that
can put some pressure.

CAMPBELL

Get me a fucking sketch of this
guy and we can nail him! Do not
let this disappear.

Campbell turns and walks away, disgusted.

EXT. CHICAGO

A young girl
heavy boots,
stamping her

STREET - NIGHT

(JESSICA) wearing a very dirty army jacket,
and other punk-rock accessories stands
feet against the cold on a busy sidewalk

bumming change.

She approaches several PASSERSBY all of whom ignore her.
JESSICA
Excuse me, spare some change for
a room? It's cold tonight....
Sir... Ma'am I didn't sell
enough girl scout cookies and...
Dad! Don't you recognize me.
It's me!

Her hopes deflate. Another PASSERBY approaches.

JESSICA (CONT'D)
Sir, spare some change?

Cutting to her POV reveals that Griffin is the passerby.
He doesn't answer but he stops.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Spare some change, mister?

GRIFFIN
(disarmingly direct)
What are you doing out here?

JESSICA
(very girlish)
Spanging. Spare changing.

GRIFFIN
Don't you have a job or
anything?

JESSICA
Yeah, right. And I can buy the
fuckin station wagons full of
screaming kids? Fuck that very
much. The revolution's coming.
You wait.

GRIFFIN
Well, I very much doubt that.
But I do admire your ideals.
Somehow when you get older they
all seem to just go away.

JESSICA
Yeah, whatever. So can you
spare 'some change or what?

GRIFFIN
Only if you dance with me.
JESSICA
(laughing, surprised)
Shut up.

GRIFFIN
I'm serious.

He holds his hand out to her. She smiles and blushes, a
very young girl again.

JESSICA
There's no music.

GRIFFIN
I'll hum for us.

He begins humming out the rhythm. She takes his arms and
he leads her through a few steps.

JESSICA

(giggling)
You better give me some money.

GRIFFIN
I will.

She stops suddenly, laughing too hard to continue.

JESSICA
I can't. I can't. Just give me
some money.

GRIFFIN
(laughing with her)
You can. C'mon.

He starts humming again. She takes his hands with a
laugh and they dance again.

INT. POLLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A form moves across the moonlit window. A moment later a
flashlight pops on.

POV, lit by the flashlight, as a file cabinet drawer
slides open. As a hand rifles through the files. He
gets to 'Joel Campbell' and pulls the file. He opens
another drawer and pulls Campbell's tapes, carefully
replacing the plastic covers so that from a casual
glimpse that don't appear to be missing.
CUT TO:

a dark room, the only light from a photocopier repeatedly
coping pages, the light eerily creating an intermittent
silhouette.

EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING

A wide shot of the cityscape.

INT. CAMPBELL'S OFFICE - MORNING

Campbell sits behind his desk looking through the crime
scene photos and other evidence.

After a few seconds, one of the overhead florescent
lights begins to flicker.

Immediately, Campbell covers both eyes and cowers from
the light.

CAMPBELL
(calling out)
Somebody give me a hand! Can
somebody turn out the light in
here for a minute!?

No answer. Campbell stands up, his eyes still closed.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
(losing patience)

Can someone grab this light for
me!?

After another couple seconds, Campbell loses it. He
jerks the keyboard of his commuter free from the desk and
hurls it overhead into the bank of fluorescents, sending
glass and the keyboard crashing back down with a great
clatter.

Hearing the commotion, Diana runs into his office.

DIANA
What the hell was that?
CAMPBELL
(keyboard in hand)
Sorry to disturb. Flickering
lights trigger migraines faster
than anything else.

He tosses the keyboard onto the desk casually. She
shakes her head and shrugs.

DIANA
Great to have you around,
Campbell. Adds great color.

Campbell's secretary pops her head in his office behind
Diana.

CAMPBELL'S SECRETARY
Agent Campbell? This came for
you a few minutes ago.

He turns to look at her. She holds up a Fed-ex envelope.

CAMPBELL'S SECRETARY (CONT'D)
(clueless)
Do you want it?

INT. CAMPBELL'S OFFICE - LATER

Campbell, Ibby, Mitch, and Diana stand in front of
another gallery of posters - extreme closeups of every
inch of the frame. Almost everything is out of focus
except for her face.

MITCH
These are just blown straight
up. They're trying to pull some
of this shit into better focus.

CAMPBELL
This is shot with a long lens to
get the shallow depth of field
which is going to make it hard.
He's trying to give us as little
context as possible.

DIANA
It's working.
CAMPBELL
At least this one's outside.
Where is she sitting? Let's
start there. Get someone from
the city in here. Let's see if
they recognize the sidewalk or
the parking meter or anything
else.

DIANA
I'm on it.

Campbell looks closely at a shot of a tattoo on her
forearm.

CAMPBELL
Mitch, put a picture in every
tattoo parlor in Chicago.

MITCH
Got it.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS, PRESS ROOM - LATER

Again, Hollis addresses the PRESS. This time, however,
there are more than a hundred REPORTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS.

AGGRESSIVE REPORTER
Would you say that the arrival
of the photo calls into question
the arrest the department has-

HOLLIS

(on edge)
-the arrest was based on very
strong evidence and our
department stands by it. If it
turns out that the killer is
still at large then we obviously
will release the suspect as
quickly as is feasible.

Several reporters blurt questions.

INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - LATER

The row of young agents settle into their chairs in front
of bank of phones.
INT. LOCAL NEWS ROOM - LATER

The daytime ANCHORWOMAN addresses the camera. Jessica's
picture is on the screen above her shoulder.

ANCHORWOMAN
Police released this photograph
just moments ago. This woman
appears to be the next target in
this horrifying game of cat and
mouse.

MONTAGE. SHOTS OF VARIOUS CITIZENS WATCHING THE NEWS.

EXT. STREET CORNER - LATER

Jessica sits in the doorway of a condemned building
chatting with a young KID with a skateboard about her
age.

SKATER
Watch, watch check it out.

The skater tries a trick on his skateboard, busting his
ass with great flare. Jessica laughs hysterically.

SKATER (CONT'D)
(sweetly)
What are you laughing at?
That's the trick. You know how
long it took me to learn that
for you?

Jessica laughs again.

INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - LATER

A TECH sits in front of a twenty-inch computer screen on
which one section of the photo has been blown up. As
Campbell and company watch, the photo slowly comes into
clearer focus.

RACHEL (from city planning) looks over his shoulder. She
points to the base of a street lamp.
RACHEL
Looks like she's sitting next to
an old cast-iron street lamp.

CAMPBELL
Which puts her where?

She turns and pushes open a grid-map of the city and
takes a magic-marker and draws a fairly large rectangle.

RACHEL
Somewhere in the old town area.
A lot of territory.

Campbell looks disappointed.

EXT. STREET CORNER - LATER

Close on a stack of newspapers next to a sidewalk
newsstand. Jessica's face is on the cover.

Pull back and track down the street a few dozen feet and
reveal Jessica panhandling in her usual spot. No one
even looks at her.

JESSICA

Dad! It's me, don't you
recognize me? I had the plastic
surg-

(the guy keeps

walking)
-Hey, man, can I bum a smoke?

(a second guy shakes

his head)
Then how bout a few bucks for a
pack?

(he keeps walking)
Hi! Spare some change, I'm-

EXT. ROOFTOP - AFTERNOON

Griffin sits in a plastic lawn chair wearing a bathing
suit, headphones, and sunglasses.

POLLY (0.S.)
(from the walkman)
In other words, he missed you.
Just like you missed him.
CAMPBELL (0.S.)
What do you mean?

POLLY (0.S.)
Well the description you just
gave could apply to you, don't
you think?

Griffin smiles and pushes rewind then play again.

POLLY (0.S.) (CONT’D)
-description you just gave could
apply to you, don't you think?

INT. WOMAN'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

WANDA (57) has a hammer in one hand, nails in her mouth,
and a large glass framed inspirational poster in her hand
which she's attempting to hang by herself. '

On the TV behind her we HEAR a CNN special report.

CNN REPORTER (0.S.)
It appears that the murders may
be linked to a serial killer in
the Los Angeles area.

CU of the TV screen. A photo of Jessica fills the
screen.

CNN REPORTER (0.S.)(CONT’D)
At this point, the woman police
are calling "Jane Two" has not
yet been located and all those
involved are very concerned
about her well being.

Wanda turns around and sees Jessica on the television and
drops the poster, sending glass shattering across the
living room.

INT. CAMPBELL'S OFFICE - LATER

Campbell peruses the photo one last time with the
magnifying glass. He stops and holds his view for a beat
on a black mesh trash receptor of the same black and
chrome design as the chair Jessica sits in.

Ibby rushes into the office. Everyone looks up.
IBBY
We got Jane’s mother on the
phone!

EXT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Three F.B.I. vehicles (including Campbell's car) race out
of the gates and onto the street.

EXT. SUBURBAN CHICAGO - LATER

The vehicles race toward Wanda's two-story Victorian
home. The house is surrounded by local police cars.
Campbell, Mitch, and Diana run toward the front door.
Wanda's hysterical screaming can be heard.

INT. WANDA'S FOYER/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Campbell takes in the scene: three COPS, several
NEIGHBORS, and WANDA'S SISTER surround Wanda, who sobs
hysterically, and mumbles a PRAYER.

CAMPBELL
(taking over the scene)
Mrs. Stendhal, I'm Agent Joel
Campbell with the F.B.I.

Wanda continues to sob.

WANDA’S SISTER
She doesn't know anything!
Can't you see what kinda shape
she's in-

CAMPBELL
I can see that but if we don't
find her daughter she's-

WANDA’S SISTER
(almost screaming)
She doesn't know anything!

CAMPBELL
What do you mean she doesn’t
know anything?
WANDA’S SISTER
Jessica ran away almost two
years ago. We don't know where
she is.

CAMPBELL
(takes a breath)
Who are you?

WANDA’S SISTER
I’m the girl's aunt. Wanda's
sister.

CAMPBELL

(to the cops)
Hey! Clear everyone else out of
the house. Let's get some quiet
in here right now.

(to the sister)
Help me with her for a few
minutes and then we'll leave her
alone. Deal? Sit with her.

Campbell turns to Mitch.

CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
Start with outreach programs for
runaways. Get them her picture.
Where do teen runaways hang out?

MITCH
Broadway and Belmont area.

CAMPBELL
Get everyone you can down there
with her picture. Start with CD
shops, convenience stores, video
arcades, fast food joints,
anywhere else kids would go and
then fan out from there.

He turns back to Wanda, who still sobs. He
her.

CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
Mrs. Stendhal? I know that no
one wants us to find Jessica
more than you do, but in order
for that to happen, you're going
to have to help us out.

kneels with
She just continues to sob. He sighs.

CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
(to the sister)
Okay, listen, spend a few
minutes with her. Calm her
down. Can I take a look at
Jessica's room?

INT. CIRCUIT CITY - LATER

Jessica's face is plastered across 40 television screens
at Circuit City. The nighttime ANCHORMAN'S VOICE booms
through the store.

ANCHORMAN (0.S.)
Jessica Stendhal. That is this
young woman's name. She is
sixteen years old and thought to
be living somewhere in Chicago.
Police have located the young
woman's mother but unfortunately
they have not located Jessica.

INT. JESSICA’S ROOM - LATER

Campbell and Diana stand somberly in Jessica's room,
rifling through Jessica's belongings, which Wanda has
left untouched.

The walls are covered with posters, magazine cutouts,
etc. Campbell notes a 'Tony Hawk' skateboard poster as
well as posters for 'The Offspring', 'Hole', and others.
He notes a light blue Fender Stratocaster electric
guitar. On the table are several issues of 'Thrasher
Magazine' (a skateboard magazine).

CAMPBELL
Make a couple calls for me. Get
a picture to every skateboard
shop and park and the guitar
shops close to Belmont and
Broadway. I'm going to look for
her letters and-

WANDA (0.S.)
There aren’t any.

Campbell and Diana turn to see Wanda and her sister in
the doorway. Wanda's calmed somewhat.

WANDA (CONT’D)
She never wrote anybody. She
did call two or three times
after she disappeared.

CAMPBELL
Did she say where she was
calling from?

WANDA
She wouldn't tell us anything.
She always wanted to talk to the
damn dog. She'd make me put the
phone up to it and she'd coo and
make baby-talk.

CAMPBELL
Can you remember anything at all
about those calls? Anything
might help.

WANDA
What does it matter? It's all
lies anyway. She's on drugs.
We did what we could.

She begins to sob again. Her sister pats her shoulder.

WANDA (CONT’D)
She said all kinds of things. I
never knew what to believe. She
had a new boyfriend. A lawyer.
Yeah right! She called once to
say she had a job at the
Starbucks.

Campbell looks at a clock on the wall. 5:10.

INT. CAMPBELL'S CAR/HOLLIS’ OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell races through traffic. The sun is just
beginning to disappear behind the horizon. He talks to
Hollis on the cell-phone.

HOLLIS
Bad news. She does not work nor
has she ever worked for
Starbucks.
CAMPBELL
Goddamnit! That can't be right.
Look at the picture, Hollis.
She's sitting at a coffee shop.

HOLLIS
(looking at the photo)
I don't know. Just looks like a
chair to me. Could be anywhere.

CAMPBELL
Look at the trash can next to
her

Hollis looks at the wire mesh trash can.

CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
See what's in it? White paper
cups. She's sitting ata
fucking Starbucks.

HOLLIS

(standing)

I'll see what I can do.

Hollis opens the map of the city.

INT. STARBUCKS DOWNTOWN - EVENING

A YOUNG COP shows the STAFF behind the counter a picture
of Jessica.

YOUNG COP
Her name is Jessica Stendhal.
Are you sure you haven't seen
her?

The kids all shake their heads.

INT. DIFFERENT STARBUCKS - NIGHT

Another COP shows a picture of Jessica.

INT. DIFFERENT STARBUCKS - NIGHT

Another COP talks to a CLERK behind the counter.
STARBUCKS CLERK
Totally, man. She comes in here
all the time.

The cop reaches for his radio and lifts it to his mouth.

INT. HOLLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT
MATCH CUT to Hollis lifting his phone to his mouth.

HOLLIS
Positive ID. The Starbucks on
Lincoln and Wisconsin.

CAMPBELL (0.S.)
Meet you there.

EXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT

It's now quite dark as dozens of uniformed POLICEMEN roam
the area, passing out hundreds of black and white fliers
with Jessica's picture on them. Most people don't even
want to take the fliers.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

Most of the interior walls have been torn down on the top
floor of this abandoned, turn-of-the century office tower
leaving a wide-open space that makes for a great moonlit

playground for Jessica and her skater friend.

He stands on his skateboard holding her hands as she
runs, pulling him in and out of the support beams slalom
style.

INT. STARBUCKS - CONTINUOUS

Campbell and Hollis question the clerk. Mitch stands
nearby.

STARBUCKS CLERK
Yeah, I told the other dudes she
comes in but she doesn't work
here. I let her use the
bathroom, you know?
CAMPBELL
Do you have any idea how we can
find her? Where she lives?

STARBUCKS CLERK
Dude, she lives on the street.

EXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT

Campbell walks out into the night air, unsure what his
next move should be. He watches a couple uniformed COPS
passing out fliers with Jessica's picture on them.
Several PEOPLE don't even look at the fliers, simply
shaking their heads as they pass.

A BUSINESSMAN brushes off one of the COPS with a shrug.
Campbell loses it, running wildly up to the cop and
grabbing his fliers and chasing down the businessman, and
spinning him around roughly.

CAMPBELL
LOOK AT THE FUCKING PICTURE!
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL?

The businessman is shaken up by Campbell's assault but
after a moment he manages to look at the photo.

BUSINESSMAN
No. I’m sorry-

Campbell pushes him away and turns to the next nearest
PASSERBY and again scares them into paying attention.

CAMPBELL
You! Look at this girl's face!
Do you know her? Have you seen
her?

PASSERBY
No, I--

CAMPBELL
Look at her before you answer!

PASSERBY
(looking)
No. I don’t know her.
Campbell spins and aggressively approaches another
PASSERBY.

INT. WANDA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Wanda sits in her sister's arms, crying quietly.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

Jessica and the skater sit huddled together around a fire
that they've built from scraps of cardboard and sheet
rock. A small cheap jambox plays a BAUHAUS song.

SKATER
I have to go. I'm sorry. I'm
so late.

JESSICA

Can I go with you? Can I sneak
in your room?

SKATER
We can't, Jess, last time we got
caught my dad went ballistic.
Don't be sad, Jessie. I gotta
split.

He stands up to leave.

EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

Next to the building, the skater ducks a chain link fence
and steps into the alley. He turns on the sidewalk and
heads toward Campbell who, fifty feet away, continues to
flag down passing PEDESTRIANS.

The kid almost skates right by Campbell who talks to a
YOUNG WOMAN, but Campbell hears the sound of wheels
against the concrete and spins around. His gaze lands on
the kid's board.

CAMPBELL
(holding up his hand)
Stop, wait!

The skater clocks Campbell for a cop.
SKATER
What? I didn’t do anything.

CAMPBELL
I didn't say you did.
(he holds up picture)
Do you know this girl? She's
about your-

The surprise on his face is evident.

SKATER
Fuck you, cop. I don't know
shit.

CAMPBELL

Bullshit. Listen to me-

The kid suddenly makes a break for it, darting across
traffic and almost getting squashed. BRAKES squeal and
horns BLARE.

Hollis looks up and catches a glimpse of Campbell chasing
the kid right toward where he is standing. The kid sees
Hollis and veers into an alley. Hollis drops his fliers
and runs after them.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - LATER

Jessica lies quietly, alone in front of the dying fire,
huddled in a dirty sleeping bag to ward off the cold.
Reverse to what would be Jessica's POV if she turned
around and we see a figure silhouetted against the
Chicago skyline.

EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY WAY - CONTINUOUS

The skater tries to out sprint Hollis but Hollis catches
him, tackling him roughly onto the dirty concrete. The
skater comes up swinging, kicking, biting, scratching and
screaming. Hollis tries to restrain him without hurting
him.

SKATER
Fucking cop! Fuck you! I
didn't do shit! Fuck you! Let
go.
Campbell catches up, looks around to make sure no one's
looking, and then open-hand slaps the shit out of the
kid.

CAMPBELL
If you don't help me, right now,
a man is going to wrap piano
wire around her neck so
viciously it will almost sever
her head.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - LATER

Jessica sits by the fire. Her face tightens as she
senses someone behind her but she doesn't turn around.
The figure approaches the firelight revealing that it is
in fact Griffin. Though she is clearly nervous, she
tries not to let it show.

JESSICA
Hi.
GRIFFIN
Hi. What are you listening to?
JESSICA
Bauhaus.
GRIFFIN
(singing)

Bela Logosi's dead. Bela
Logosi's dead.

JESSICA
No way. You know it? Here, let
me turn it up.

She sits up and adjusts the volume, casually picking up
the jambox in the process and then SMACKING it into
Griffin's face. She stands up and sprints through the
darkness.

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - CONTINUOUS

The skater now leads Hollis and Campbell on a full-run
back to the abandoned building.

As they cross the main street near the Starbucks, Hollis
radios for back up.
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
Griffin now runs through the darkness in the direction
Jessica had gone. She makes it across the top floor and
to the stairwell.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

It's pitch black and only shapes can be seen. HEAVY
BREATHING and FOOTSTEPS fill the empty space.

After making it down two flights of stairs, she comes to
a closed door (which, knowing the building, she had
expected) and has to run across another abandoned floor.
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
Unlike the top floor, however, the kids haven't kicked
down all the interior walls of this floor. Griffin
closes in right behind her.

She knows she can't out run him so she makes the
dangerous decision to duck into one of the old offices,
initiating a deadly game of hide and seek.

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - CONTINUOUS

The skater, Campbell, and Hollis sprint through traffic.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Jessica has managed to crawl from office space to office
space, apparently unseen by Griffin.

Several times she has to make the horrifying leap from
behind one wall to another exposing herself briefly in
the moonlight as she inches her way toward the other
stairwell.

EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Downstairs, the skater leads Campbell and Hollis under
the chain-link fence and into the building.
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
Campbell, Hollis, and the kid run up the stairs.

SKATER
(breathing hard)
She sleeps on the top floor.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Campbell, Hollis and the kid burst through the stairwell
and onto the seventh floor (where we last saw Jessica).
A shadow passes the light ahead. Campbell stops short
and puts a hand on the kid's chest.

Hollis immediately pulls the boy back into the stairwell.

Campbell moves quickly, gun drawn, down the main corridor
toward the direction he saw the shadow.

He fires FIVE SHOTS instinctively as Griffin leaps from
the darkness and into the stairwell.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

In the stairwell, Griffin slams his weight into a steel
door (leading down to the next floor) but the door won't
budge. After a couple tries he turns and heads up the
stairs.

Griffin runs up the stairs. Campbell pounds the metal
stairs below him.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Griffin reaches the top floor and crosses as fast as he
can toward another stairwell. Campbell kicks the door
open and takes FOUR MORE SHOTS at his figure. Again,
Griffin goes untouched. He makes it to the other
stairwell and heads toward the roof.

EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
Dozens of other cops pour into the building. Two police

helicopters hover over the building, spotlights sweeping
the brick and broken windows.
EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING, ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Griffin runs onto the roof. Shortly thereafter, the
police helicopters have him in their spotlights.

Campbell bursts onto the roof and runs full-sprint toward
Griffin, shooting insanely without breaking stride.

Griffin spots a smaller office building below; he sprints
and leaps from the roof over an alley way, tumbling as he
lands two stories below.

Campbell follows him dangerously across the alley.

At the other end of the building, Griffin jumps again,
this time to an even lower building.

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - CONTINUOUS

A wide shot of storefronts as Griffin hurdles from one
rooftop to the next as he finally eludes the searchlights
and disappears between buildings, Campbell right on his
heels

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

We pick up Griffin mid-air a second before he lands feet
first on the exploding windshield of a truck.

He tumbles off and steals down the alley. Campbell jumps
across the alleyway to a nearby fire escape and quickly
jumps from level to level, until he reaches bottom level.
He jumps into the alley and chases Griffin.

OBVIOUSLY, THIS WILL ALL DEPEND ON LOCATION AND STORY
BOARDS. THE GENERAL POINT IS TO INCLUDE CAMPBELL IN THE
CHASE ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE GAS STATION.

SIRENS wail from all directions as Griffin slinks down
another alley. He comes upon a beat-up old Lincoln. He
picks up a metal trashcan and smashes out a window.
Campbell rounds the corner, way down the block, in time
to see the lights come on and hear the car start. He
picks up his pace, sprinting as fast as he can. Halfway
down the alley, he misses a step and slips to one knee.
He holds his heart and shakes his left arm. He struggles
to shake it off and pick back up the chase.
EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

The Lincoln eases onto a nearby street, but within
seconds several cops cars are on his ass.

Campbell runs out of the alley, still chasing him on foot
and almost gets hit by a police cruiser. He slams his
fist on the hood and signals the startled COP to get out
of his car. Campbell holds up his badge.

CAMPBELL
Special Agent Campbell. I head
the FBI/Chicago PD task force
which means I rank you which
means I'm taking your car.

Griffin punches the accelerator, rounds a corner and
comes face to face with a road block which he simply
BLASTS through, sending wooden saw-horses and COPS
flying. A moment later, Campbell races through the same
intersection.

Griffin speeds another block before coming up on stopped
traffic at a red light, Campbell closing in behind him.
Griffin jumps a median and passes the stopped cars in the
oncoming lanes.

He races across the busy intersection and almost makes it
through but gets clipped by a pick-up truck and loses
control, jumping the sidewalk and SMASHING through a
glass and plastic bus-stop before side-swiping a row of
three gas pumps.

EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

Three mushrooms of gas spray out of the ground showering
Griffin's Lincoln and drenching the parking lot.

Griffin sits, calmly waiting as cop cars converge from
every direction. Campbell gets out of his car and draws
his weapon. Several Cops do the same.

He waits. More and more cops pull up.

He calmly shifts the car in gear and tosses a Zippo
lighter out the window.

The entire area explodes.
A block away, Griffin races down the side street and
disappears.

EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT

Aerial shot of the wreckage. The gas station still
burns. Charred cop cars. Dozens of other cops parked
here and there. Ambulances. The shot tracks two blocks
revealing other car accidents and the abandoned building
which is still swarming with cops. The shot lowers and
closes in on a seventh-story window. Closer and closer--

DISSOLVE THROUGH THE WINDOW- -

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

A DOZEN or so COPS and FEDS work the crime scene.
Campbell crouches next to Jessica's bloody body, her face
etched with death.

He looks into her eyes for a long moment then lowers his
head in a gesture that suggests a very deep surrender.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Campbell's apartment looks worse than usual. It's dark
dusty and it looks as if it has been ransacked. He is
nowhere to be seen, but Ibby's voice can be heard through
the door.

IBBY (0.S.)
Campbell!? You okay? Open the
door.

INT. CAMPBELL'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
Ibby and Mitch stand in the hallway outside Campbell's
apartment. Ibby bangs on the door loudly. He gives up

and turns to Mitch.

IBBY
Open it.

Mitch pulls a small electronic device from his pocket and
kneels in front of the door. The device looks something
like a handheld screwdriver with a modified tip. Mitch
inserts the tip into the keyhole and WHIRS the machine to
life. There's a short RATTLE before the knob turns and
Ibby pushes the door open.

INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ibby and Mitch enter the dank apartment, concerned by its
appearance.

Ibby opens the bedroom door and sees Campbell's legs
hanging out of the bathroom floor. He and Mitch rush
over.

INT. CAMPBELL'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ibby leans over Campbell and tries to rouse him. He is
pale white and the bathroom is a mess. Ibby checks his
pulse.

IBBY
(to Mitch)
Jesus, he's freezing cold. Call
a paramedic!

But just then Campbell rouses awake. Campbell presses
his hand to his head.

CAMPBELL
(wheezing)
Ibby, a paramedic shows up at
this apartment I swear to you I
will shoot them.

He shakes Ibby's arm loose from his clothes and sits up
against the bathroom counter. Campbell tries to stand
but immediately slumps back to one knee, gasping for
breath. His eyes go wide with confusion and pain.

IBBY
(to Mitch)
Call them!

INT. CAMPBELL'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Campbell lies in bed, semi-conscious. Ibby and a DOCTOR
hover over him. The doctor holds a small rubber toy in
the shape of a martian.
DOCTOR
The blood pressure got too great
for one of the veins in your
heart and it collapsed. Sounds
worse than it is. It'll bea
minor procedure called an angio-
plasty. We'll stick a small
balloon through a scope and into
the collapsed vein and BOOP! We
open it back up.

She squeezes the toy causing it's martian head to triple
in size and its eyes and ears to pop out cartoonishly.

CAMPBELL
(to Mitch)
It’s out of the question. I'll
have to put it off.

IBBY
Bullshit.

DOCTOR

Absolutely not. Your heart
muscle isn't getting the oxygen
it needs. The tissue is dying.
I want to go into the O.R. r
ight now. Two, three days
here, another week of rest and
then you can start back easy, a
few hours a day. Look, I have a
daughter at University of
Chicago. I want to get you back
in shape as much as anyone.

(squeezes the toy again)
Trust me.

Campbell closes his eyes, overwhelmed by a sense of

futility.

EXT. POLICE DISTRICT - DAY

Outside the police district office, a crowd
of BYSTANDERS, REPORTERS, and PHOTOGRAPHERS
makeshift police barricade between the door
van.

A moment later four COPS exit the building,
Norton who wears an orange prison jumpsuit.

of hundreds
crowd a
and a police

escorting
COPS work the barricade trying to hold everyone back as
they all surge forward to get a look or ask a question.
Hollis takes in the scene with disgust.

POP! POP! POP! Suddenly everyone hits the ground and
scatters as three shots are fired from close range.

Norton slumps to the ground bleeding from two bullet
wounds. One cop has also been hit.

The rest of the cops draw their weapons on an OLDER MAN
in light blue Sansa-belt slacks and a golf shirt who
stands holding a small-caliber revolver. The COPS
wrestle him to the ground.

EXT. POLICE DISTRICT - MOMENTS LATER

Norton lays on a stretcher next to an ambulance. The
area is chaotic. One PARAMEDIC pumps his chest; another
PARAMEDIC has an oxygen mask over his mouth.

Hollis hovers next to the paramedics, cringing at his
terrible state. After a few seconds, Norton stirs and
cries out in pain.

PARAMEDIC
(to her co-worker)
He’s conscious!
(to Hollis)
Talk to him! Try to keep him

alert!

HOLLIS
Me? Shit I don't know what to
say!

PARAMEDIC

Just talk to him! Say the
alphabet! Anything!

HOLLIS
(frazzled)
Hey! Norton! Hang in there,
man. We're going to the
hospital right now! You're
looking good.

PARAMEDIC
His blood pressure's dropping!
HOLLIS
It's not my fault!

PARAMEDIC
I wasn't talking to you!

HOLLIS
Oh. Sorry.
(back to Norton, as if
to a child)
What else, what else? Let's
see... I had a retarded cousin

once. Bet you didn't know that,
did you? He died though.

The paramedics work faster to try to save him but Hollis
senses that it's over and stops talking.

INT. CAMPBELL'S HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Campbell watches a special report on the local news
broadcast from outside the station.

FEMALE REPORTER
The gunman is reported to be
Padgett Weaver, the recent
murder victim's sixty-six year-
old father who had just arrived
in Chicago. When asked why he
didn't trust the justice system
to do its job, Mr. Weaver said
simply, "I am an old man and I
don't have time for that crap."

Campbell sighs and tosses his hands in the air at this.
Just then, Polly enters the room tentatively.

CAMPBELL
(pleased to see her)
You didn't have to come here.

POLLY
Something tells me you wouldn't
have come to me.

CAMPBELL
(pointing at the TV)
D'you see they shot my witness?
It's like someone's making up
new ways to be ridiculous.
POLLY
Maybe you should get your nerves
all bound up in a knot about it.
(clicks off the TV)
I can't believe they let you
watch that thing.

CAMPBELL
How else am I going to know
what's going on? Ibby's got
everyone on a vow of silence.

POLLY
When's the last time you ate?
Are you allowed to eat anything
besides the shit they serve
here?

CAMPBELL
Probably not but let's order
something anyway.

POLLY
How's Thai? My favorite joint
is just around the corner.

INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS, GARAGE AREA - MORNING

Mitch, Diana, and SEVERAL FORENSIC TECHS, stand under a
dirty LATE MODEL SEDAN that has been lifted on a
mechanic's lift. All of the doors are wide open.

The back window has been shot out, and the front fender
and grill are damaged. The car appears to be the one
Hollis and Campbell chased a few nights ago.

FORENSIC TECH
We found two of the slugs
imbedded in the frame.

DIANA
No other physical evidence?

FORENSIC TECH
Not yet, but give a guy a break.
This thing was in the river
three hours ago.

Just then, Campbell's secretary comes into the room
holding an 8' X 10' envelope.
CAMPBELL'S SECRETARY
Excuse me, Agent Casper? This
came for Agent Campbell and I
thought you-

MITCH
How'd it get here!?

CAMPBELL'S SECRETARY
(clueless)
It just came in the regular
mail.

Mitch snatches the envelope from her hands and waves at
Diana.

MITCH
(heading out of the room)
Let's do it. Get Mackie on the
phone. Get a copy to him. I'm
going to get with Ibby.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS, PRESS ROOM - MORNING
Again, Hollis addresses a battery of reporters.

HOLLIS
Good morning and thanks for your
attention. My comments today
will be brief. As most of you
know, we have received another
photograph.

The bank of REPORTERS all BLURT questions at once.

INT. CAMPBELL'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

Campbell sits in bed, looking totally wrecked. He watches
Hollis finish his address on TV.

HOLLIS

(calming the

reporters)
No, no, no. I'm not answering
questions today. I'm only here
to pass on the photograph and
request that you continue to
help us in this investigation.
That is all.
Campbell sits with no noticeable expression of emotion on
his face. He seems truly defeated.

ANCHORWOMAN (0.S.)
Police Detective Hollis Mackie
informing us that this terrible
game will continue today. Here
is a photograph of the killer's
latest target.

Campbell suddenly reacts strongly to the television. He
half stands up, almost stumbling out of bed. He pulls
the IV from his arm, still not taking his eyes off the
TV. We still can't see what he sees, though his reaction
makes us wish we could.

INT. HOLLIS' CAR/MITCH'S OFFICE - DAY - INTERCUT
Hollis races along talking to Mitch on the cell phone.

MITCH
Mitch Casper.

HOLLIS
It's Mackie. I'm looking for
Campbell. He's not at the
hospital.

MITCH
Yeah, they just called to inform
us of that very fact. Nobody
knows where he is.

HOLLIS
Maybe he's at home? I'1l drop
by there.

MITCH
There's really no way to tell,
is there?

He hangs up the phone and wheels the car around the
opposite direction.

INT. HOLLIS' CAR - DAY
Hollis screeches to a halt outside of Campbell's

apartment, leaving his car double-parked. He runs up to
the front door.
INT. CAMPBELL'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
Hollis bangs loudly on Campbell's door.

HOLLIS
Hey! Open the Goddamn door!
Hey! Campbell? You okay?!

He sighs, steps away from the door and kicks it open.
INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Hollis enters Campbell's stuffy, messy apartment.

HOLLIS
Jesus, man. You gotta get a
maid. Campbell?!

Hollis quickly searches the kitchen (small and visible
from the living room) and the bedroom (he opens the door
and can tell it's empty).

Hollis tries one last door. It's locked. He knocks
loudly.

HOLLIS (CONT'D)
Campbell?

He tries the door again, jiggling the knob very hard. It
doesn't budge.

HOLLIS (CONT'D)
(to himself)
This is becoming a habit.

WHACK! He kicks the door in. The room appears to be a
walk-in closet. Inside, cardboard boxes are stacked from
floor to ceiling.

INT. CAMPBELL'S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

Hollis steps inside the room, curiously. He opens a box
and pulls out some file-folders - crime scene photos,
reports, etc. Griffin's name is everywhere.

These are obviously Campbell's personal files on Griffin.
Hollis notices several burned down candles. He turns
around and sees a thin white sheet covering one wall of
the closet.
He lifts the sheet and tries to peer under. A look of
confusion washes over his face. He yanks the sheet from
the wall, sending tacks flying.

The sheet drops down to reveal the enormous photographic
collage we saw in the opening credits. Its true scope
and detail are revealed for the first time.

It spans the entire wall and looks as if it were
methodically, obsessively pasted together.

HOLLIS
(awe-struck)
What the fuck?

He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a folded
white piece of paper. He unfolds the paper and looks at
it:

It is a flier with a photo of the next victim. He holds
it close to the collage to reveal that it is THE WOMAN IN
THE COLLAGE.

HOLLIS (CONT'D)
Jesus, Campbell, what is this?

His eyes dart around the collage. He reads the newspaper
clippings: INQUIRY CLEARS AGENT OF NEGLIGENCE. He sees
Campbell's name in all of the articles. Griffin's name
is in several as well. The name 'Lisa Alexander' is also
everywhere. The birthday card reads "Love, Lisa". He
scans quickly trying to make sense of what he's seeing.
DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO NINETEEN. AGENT BEGINS INDEFINITE
LEAVE.

Hollis glances at something that clicks. It's a
photograph of a cemetery. A closer shot of a headstone
shows the engraving to be 'Lisa Alexander. 1964-1999'

INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Hollis steps out of the closet and toward the front door.
On the TV there is a picture of Lisa Alexander.

CNN REPORTER (0.S.)
...at this time police have not
located the young woman who they
have reason to believe...
INT. CAMPBELL'S CAR - AFTERNOON

Campbell drives through light traffic. He rounds a
corner and we see the CEMETERY from the photograph
through the windshield.

Campbell pulls into the deserted parking lot and steps
out.

EXT. CAMPBELL'S BUILDING - AFTERNOON

Hollis runs down the front stairs. He hops in his car.

EXT. CEMETERY - AFTERNOON

Campbell walks through the graveyard, unhurried but
deliberate.

He rounds a corner and stops short. Griffin sits on the
grave we saw Campbell leaning against earlier.

Campbell draws his gun and walks slowly over. Griffin
notices him.

GRIFFIN
Hey Campbell! How's your heart,
pal? Here have a beer, it'll
make it feel better. Here.

Griffin tosses him a beer but Campbell side-steps it,

letting drop to the ground. He loads a shell into the
chamber of his 9mm, still trying to make sense of the

situation.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
Tell me something, Campbell.
Did you move two thousand miles
to live near this woman's grave?

Griffin takes a drink out of his beer. Campbell tightens
his grip on the pistol. He takes dead aim at Griffin's
forehead.
GRIFFIN (CONT'D)

It's true, isn't it? Man, you
gotta get out more. I mean is
this a satisfying relationship?

(picks a flower and

plucks pedals)
She loves me... She's
decomposing... She loves me...
she's decomposing.

CAMPBELL
(lowering the gun)
Why don't we talk about what
we're doing here. Is this it?
You here to give yourself up?

GRIFFIN
Why didn't you ever tell anyone
you laying pipe with her? Just
cause she was married?

CAMPBELL
(losing patience)
We don't seem to be
communicating. Let me be clear
with you, I have no problem with
shooting you dead where you sit.

GRIFFIN
Well you do have one problem.

Griffin tosses his beer and fishes a business card out of
his pocket. Campbell quickly raises his gun. Griffin
doesn't even flinch.

Careful to keep his gun trained on Griffin, Campbell
reaches and takes the card. It reads: Polly Beilman,
Ph.D. It is badly stained with blood. Campbell winces.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
If I'm dead, your friend Polly
plans to meet a rather gruesome
fate involving candlelight and
quite a large pool of kerosene.

Campbell looks at him for a long moment, weighing his
options.
GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
You know something about
attractive women burning alive,
don't you? Tell me, what was it
like? Could you smell her flesh
burning?

Campbell flicks Polly's business card toward Griffin, it
flutters away and lands in the grass.

CAMPBELL
You've already killed her.

GRIFFIN
C'mon. You know me better than
that. That's not even her
blood.

CAMPBELL
Take me to see her then.

GRIFFIN
Oh, I don't know about that.
Let's just sit here and talk for
a little while.

CAMPBELL
We'll talk once I see her. I
have to know if there's anything
to talk about.

Griffin looks at him for a long beat.

Campbell lowers his gun, takes a breath and hands it to
Griffin who is surprised by the gesture.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
C'mon, take it. I trust you. I
just need to see that she's all
right and then we'll talk.

Griffin shrugs and takes the gun.

GRIFFIN
Fine. Let's go.

They turn and take a few steps. Blam! Griffin shoots
the ground, startling Campbell.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
Wow. It's loaded.
Campbell relaxes and they take a few more steps. BLAM!
Griffin laughs. BLAM!

INT. HOLLIS' CAR - EVENING

Hollis races dangerously through traffic.

INT. GRIFFIN'S SEDAN - EVENING

Campbell drives, seething with anger; Griffin sets
Campbell's gun on the seat next to him.

GRIFFIN
You look older since you were in
LA. You look more and more like
your father.

Campbell turns to look at him.
GRIFFIN (CONT'D)

Relax, I never hurt him. I just
used to go visit him in the
home. Towards the end, he
couldn't tell the difference
between us so I just told him I
was you. It made him happy,
that you were there.

CAMPBELL
Listen to me, Griffin. What do
you want? I want you to think
about what you need. I can try
to get you that and we can make
an exchange. Anything that you
need for Ms. Beilman's safety.

GRIFFIN
You're all I need, Campbell.
EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Griffin's car cruises along on the freeway.

EXT. CEMETERY - EVENING

Hollis' car is parked in the deserted lot. He stands
nearby searching a directory of the cemetery plots.
EXT. CEMETERY, GRAVE SITE - MOMENTS LATER

Hollis stands over Lisa Alexander's grave. Griffin's
picnic beer bottles are still strewn about. He struggles
to make sense of the scene.

His first clear clue comes when he comes across a
cartridge from Campbell's gun. He searches the area some
more and finds Polly's bloody business card.

He still has no real idea of what went on.

INT. HOLLIS' CAR - EVENING

Again, even though his driving puts him right on the edge
of death, Hollis talks calmly on the radio.

HOLLIS
See what you can find out about
Polly Beilman. She's a shrink.
Her office is at 2414 Eastern
Avenue. Send a car by to check
it out. I'm there in ten.

INT. CHICAGO STREET - EVENING

Griffin's car eases off the freeway and into traffic.

INT. GRIFFIN'S SEDAN - CONTINUOUS
Campbell drives.

GRIFFIN
(sincere)
You're not angry with me, are
you, Campbell? You don't think
I'm an evil person, do you?

CAMPBELL

(taken aback by his tone)
I'm not much in a position to be
a judge right now, but, I think
words like evil are just words
people use to keep from having
to think. You are who you are.
You do what your driven to do.
That's the way it makes sense to
me.
Griffin takes Campbell's hand with both of his and
squeezes it.

GRIFFIN
Thanks, Campbell. You're a good
friend. You're like a brother
to me. Did you know that?

CAMPBELL
Did you have any real brothers
or si-

GRIFFIN

Oh, Campbell, what the fuck?!
I'm trying to have a real
conversation and you're psycho
analyzing me! Are you Polly
now?

CAMPBELL
(turns away)
You brought it up. I think it
was a perfectly valid-

GRIFFIN

Look at me when I talk to you!

(Campbell does)
You're trying to control this
situation! Can't you leave your
job out of this?! Just this
once! I'm telling you Campbell,
you've been seeing that bitch
Polly too-

Campbell takes a quick glimpse at the road to orient the
car.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
I said look at me when I'm
talking!

Campbell turns back, totally ignoring the road even
though they're in traffic and the road is winding.

CAMPBELL
I'm listening. What? What do
you have to say? I'm listening.
Go ahead!
They stay, eyes locked, as the car travels forty miles
per hour down the road. After a long moment, Griffin
cracks a smile.

GRIFFIN
I forgot what I was going to
say.

Campbell turns and looks back at the road but it's too
late, the car has faded into the curb.

Campbell wrenches the wheel as the car crunches up onto
the curb. Griffin and Campbell both bounce around the
front seat until Campbell gets the vehicle back under
control.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
(looking over his
shoulder )
That was fun.

Campbell uses the distraction to slip his cell phone out
of his pants pocket and push 'redial.'

EXT. POLLY'S OFFICE BUILDING - EVENING

Hollis screeches to a stop outside of Polly's office
building. Two other cruisers are already parked out
front, lights flashing.

He jumps out of his car and approaches Mitch.
MITCH

She's missing. Secretary's
upstairs dead.

HOLLIS

Fuck. What about her house?
MITCH

Empty. Your people are there

already.
Hollis’ cell phone rings.

HOLLIS
Hello?

For a moment it sounds as if the line is dead but then
Griffin's voice is heard.
GRIFFIN (0.S.)
I knew if I just came here and
talked to you, in person, you'd
understand me better, Campbell.

HOLLIS
(covering up the
phone)
Fuck. He's got Campbell. Let's
get a trace on it, now!

Mitch flips open his own cell phone.

INT. OPERATIONS ROOM, F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - EVENING

A COMPUTER TECH stands in front of a wall-sized map of
the city wearing a headset, talking to Mitch.

COMPUTER TECH
(staring impatiently
at the map)
Give me a second; give me a
second; give me a second, okay,
okay. He's about twenty miles
north of the city.

EXT. POLLY'S OFFICE BUILDING - EVENING
Mitch and Hollis stand outside both on the phone.

MITCH
You gotta do better than that!

COMPUTER TECH (0.S.)
No shit. Give me another minute
and we'll have has exact
location.

GRIFFIN (0.S.)

(on Hollis' phone)
Communication is important to
us. I realized after you left
L.A. that you were the only
thing I had...
INT. GRIFFIN'S SEDAN - EVENING

Campbell drives Griffin's car down a small street that
runs along the waterfront.

GRIFFIN

You were the only one who
thought about me. You were my
audience. And for a long time,
I was the only one you had. And
then you met Lisa, which...

(he points toa

parking lot)
Pull in here.

Campbell pulls in.

The parking lot is in front of a five story brick and
glass building that sits on the river front.

Water laps against the bricks on one side of the
building. The area is completely deserted.

As Campbell steps out of the car, he lets the cell phone
fall into the floorboard. Griffin doesn't notice it.
INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT
Campbell and Griffin step into an old steel-grated
freight elevator. Griffin holds his gun casually trained
on Campbell. He pushes a button labeled 'Five' and the
elevator begins to ascend.
INT. OPERATIONS ROOM, F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
The Computer Tech still stands in front of the map.
COMPUTER TECH
(suddenly elated)
I got him! I got him!
INT. DARK CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - NIGHT

Campbell walks reluctantly alongside Griffin down a
corridor in the warehouse.

They reach a door and Griffin unlocks it and kneels down,
carefully slipping his hand inside the door.
INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - CONTINUOUS

Griffin's fingers slide up the inside of the door and
unhook a string that runs through two pulleys before
attaching to the trigger of a small "riot" shotgun which
was set to go off if the door were opened.

Griffin pushes Campbell inside. The warehouse/loft is
about the size of a small basketball court with polished
concrete floors, high ceilings, and floor to ceiling
windows overlooking the river.

Polly sits gagged and bound to a chair in the center of
the room. The wooden chair sits in a two-inch deep pool
of kerosene.

The only light in the room comes from the windows and
several foot-tall dinner candles which stand in the
Kerosene pool.

Campbell has just long enough to take in the scene before
Griffin WHACKS him over the head with a heavy metal rod.
EXT. HOLLIS' CAR - NIGHT

Aerial shot of Hollis' car swerving through traffic.

INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS, IBBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ibby's in an F.B.I. van that screams through the streets.

EXT. MEIGS FIELD - NIGHT

Three helicopters sit, blades already angrily chopping
the air. Dozens of other AGENTS and PILOTS run here and
there.

After a moment, Ibby's F.B.I. van arrives and screeches
to a halt. Ibby jumps out and runs toward one of the
helicopters. Before he's even belted in, Hollis’ sedan
roars around a corner and races toward them.

EXT. GRAY COLONIAL STYLE HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Campbell (younger, clean-shaven) walks up to the front
porch of the house, careful not to be seen or heard.
He peers under the blinds into a window. Through the
thick leaded glass his POV is distorted.

He sees a figure move in the living room.

Campbell pulls away and looks through another window,
trying to get a better idea of what's happening.

From the second window he can see a woman bound and
gagged. His breath quickens.

He stands and kicks the front door.

INT. GRAY COLONIAL STYLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK

Campbell bursts into the front room. He hears a loud
commotion in the next-room and rounds the corner just in
time to see a man duck into a back hallway, dumping a
card table over in his haste. Campbell gets a shot off
but it thumps harmlessly into the wall.

Campbell turns his attention to LISA ALEXANDER who sits
bound and gagged in a chair - and we realize that she is
the same woman in the fire and this is the room that was
on fire. He runs quickly to her and rips the tape off
her mouth.

CAMPBELL
Are you hurt?

Paralyzed with fear, she only manages to shake her head.
The back door slams loudly, capturing Campbell's
attention.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
You're going to be all right.
Everything's going to be fine.

Campbell turns to run after the man, failing to notice
that two burning candles (which had been on the card
table) have rolled across the room and ignited a small
fire.

EXT. GRAY COLONIAL STYLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK

Campbell bursts through the back door and flies down the
stairs and into the alley.

His POV: far ahead a figure races through the shadows.
He runs down the alley, leaving the house further and
further behind. After another few seconds, he hears a
sharp CLAPPING sound.

He wheels around to see the smoke rising up from inside
the house he was just in. He sprints back toward the
house and up the staircase. He kicks in the back door,
ducking away from the rush of flames and heat.

INT. BURNING HOUSE, BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK

The woman SCREAMS. Campbell pushes further into the
crumbling hallway, dodging burning debris that falls
around him.

She SCREAMS again, a long piercing howl and-
-CAMPBELL WAKES UP INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - NIGHT

As Campbell regains consciousness it is clear that he's
disoriented and in great pain from a migraine. The room
is blurry. Cuban Dance MUSIC plays loudly. Griffin
dances lightly around the room. Polly whimpers in fear.
The music fades down and Griffin slows his dance moves
slightly.

GRIFFIN
(to Polly)
I don't know how you can just
sit there with music like this.
Such a waste.

Campbell puts one hand to his head, shielding his eyes,
and with the other, grasps at his inside pocket, looking
for his syringes. Griffin has removed the tape from
Polly's mouth.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
Who-hoo?

Campbell looks up and sees Griffin holding Campbell's
leather medicine pouch in one hand and his gun in the
other.

Griffin walks over and picks him up by his jacket and
sits him in a wooden chair (outside the perimeter of the
kerosene pool). Campbell is too disoriented to resist.

On a nearby table, Griffin clicks on a bright Halogen
desk lamp and pushes right into Campbell's face. He
flinches from the light. Griffin flips the light away
from Campbell and then back, away and then back,
repeatedly.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
That hurts, doesn't it? They say
flashing lights and migraines
just don't go together at all.

Griffin's bullying has a older-brotherish quality to it.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
(still flashing the
light)
Quick! Name three candy bars
and I'll stop. Quick! Three
candy bars! Quick!

Griffin loses interest and tosses the lamp back onto the
table. He quickly draws his gun and points it Campbell's
head.

POLLY
Noooooo!

GRIFFIN
No, no, no, no, Campbell. I'm
not going to kill you. We need
each other. We define each
other. We are yin and yang.
Black and white. Isn't that
right Polly?

Polly grows more anxious, unsure whether to answer.
Campbell's head throbs insanely and his vision is still
distorted and hazy.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
(louder )
I said, isn't that right,
Polly!?

POLLY
(very tentative)
I'm sorry, I don't understand
the question.
GRIFFIN
Did you or did you not reach the
conclusion that Campbell and I
need each other in order to have
meaning in our lives.

POLLY

Yes. I did, though, you have...

I think so. Yes.
EXT. BUCOLIC COUNTRYSIDE - EVENING
The low moon illuminates the rolling hills. There's a
moment of stillness, and then from behind a hill appears
a WHIRRING mass of rotor blades.
The three F.B.I. helicopters sweep low across the fields
outside of Chicago.

INT. F.B.I. COMMAND HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Moving low and fast over a desolate expanse of highway...
the faint glow of city lights in the distance.

Behind the COMMAND PILOT we see Ibby and the OTHERS
gazing soberly toward their destination.

EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - NIGHT

A dozen police vehicles scream through the streets of
Chicago.

INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
Campbell still squints against the light. White
splotches cloud his vision. He watches as Griffin
lightly caresses Polly's cheek and then neck....

He stands and takes several steps toward Griffin.

CAMPBELL
Take your fucking hands off her.

GRIFFIN
Sit down.
Campbell takes a few more steps toward him. Griffin puts
the gun to Polly's head. She cringes.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
Sit down!

CAMPBELL
You can talk all you want. I'll
listen but I'm not going to let
you touch. Put the gun. We
both know you're not going to do
it.

GRIFFIN
Why do we know that?

CAMPBELL
Because you only get to kill her
once and that way won't be any
fun.

BLAM! Griffin shoots Campbell in the shin, sending him
end-over-end from the force of the impact.

GRIFFIN
You're right.

EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - MOMENTS LATER

Three F.B.I. helicopters BOOM past the camera and
continue on, sweeping low across the water.

INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

Griffin stands over Campbell who writhes in agony on the
floor. An enormous pool of blood is forming under him.
Both of his hands grip his shin. Griffin picks him up
and sets him in the chair.

GRIFFIN
Get up. Get up! How's this for
Deja Vu, Campbell? We got the
fire. We got the pretty girl
that you've put in our way.
Only last time the plan
backfired. Instead of bringing
us closer, it pulled us apart.
CAMPBELL
What do you want me to say?
That I made a rookie mistake and
let my obsession with you
affect -

Griffin grabs his hair and looks him right in the eye,
the other hand cocked back with the gun pointing at his
head.

GRIFFIN

NO! NO! NO! That's not what I
want you to say! THE OBSESSION
IS ALL YOU HAVE! The HATRED is
all you have! Love is fleeting.
Hate lasts forever. The mistake
was turning back in the alley.
What I want you to say is thank
you! Thank you for coming here
and saving your life!

CAMPBELL
I don't know what the voices
tell you, Griffin, but I'm not
same as you. You don't define
me. I'm not your thing. You're
a job to me. You're paperwork.

Griffin pushes his head back and steps away. He walks
over to nearby table and picks up a length of piano wire
attached to two small wooden blocks.

POLLY
Please don't do this to me.

GRIFFIN
I have to do this. He's not
going to understand anything
else. You heard him.
Paperwork.

Campbell tries to watch what's happening but can barely
see from the blinding headache. He sees Griffin nearing
Polly, unfurling the wire in front of him. He drapes the
wire in front of her and slides it up her chest. She
whimpers.

CAMPBELL
Thank you.

Griffin stops and cocks his head.
GRIFFIN
What'd you say?

CAMPBELL
I said thank you. I mean it.
You made your point.

Griffin walks over to him and leans an ear toward him
sarcastically, again affecting the big brother.
GRIFFIN
What was that?

CAMPBELL
(whispers)
I said thank you.

Griffin leans in closer and Campbell suddenly jabs the
blade of his pocketknife under Griffin's chin, just
missing the jugular.

Griffin gasps and staggers backward, stumbling and
falling into the kerosene. His gun clatters across the
cement floor.

Campbell stands awkwardly and pounces onto Griffin,
jamming his thumbs viciously toward his bloody throat.
Kerosene splashes dangerously close to the burning
candles.

EXT. NEARBY ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

A S.W.A.T. COMMANDER motions for his men to clear the way
as the three F.B.I. helicopters rise over the rooftop's
ledge and land in unison.

INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

Griffin's about to fall unconscious as Campbell bares
down on his throat. Rings of kerosene lap against the
base of the candles, causing them to teeter back and
forth.

Griffin suddenly lands a solid blow to Campbell's temple,
knocking him aside.

Again, kerosene splashes dangerously around as they vie
for position, exchanging what punches they can.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Police vans screech to a lurching halt and cops in riot
gear pour out.

INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell and Griffin are locked together, limbs
entangled. Campbell loses his footing and Griffin slams
him down face first into the concrete. Their bodies smack
down six inches from one of the candles.

Griffin pushes Campbell's face into the kerosene.
Campbell sputters and coughs as he fights to breathe.
INT. WAREHOUSE, FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
A small army pours into the building through every ground
floor entrance.
INT. WAREHOUSE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
A metal door crashes open as waves of S.W.A.T. officers
storm the darkened basement. As they advance, their red-
laser sights trace a maze of pipes through the cavernous
basement.
S.W.A.T. OFFICER

Basement's clear.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Ibby, Hollis, and Mitch (now dressed in riot gear)
approach the building.
INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - CONTINUOUS
Griffin still has Campbell's face half-submerged.
Campbell's POV: The shotgun sits fifteen feet
away.

Campbell surges upward, rolling Griffin off of his back.

Campbell scurries across the floor and snatches up the
shotgun. He spins around and takes a bead on Griffin --
who stands calmly in the middle of the kerosene pool,
holding his bloody neck with one hand and one of the
burning candles in the other. If Campbell shoots him,
he'll drop the candle into the Kerosene.

GRIFFIN
(panting, smiling)
Oh boy, what are we going to do
now?

INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

A team of S.W.A.T. officers thunder up the metal fire
stairs.

down a dark hallway.

SECOND S.W.A.T. OFFICER
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

INT. WAREHOUSE, GROUND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Ibby, Mitch, and Hollis enter the building.

INT. LIVE/WORK SPACE - CONTINUOUS

Campbell, gun still trained on Griffin, slowly paces the
perimeter of the kerosene pool. Griffin makes his way
toward his own gun which lies in the pool a few feet
away.

GRIFFIN
Why don't you go ahead and set
that gun down?
POLLY
Don't do it!
(resolved)
He's going to kill me anyway.
Shoot this piece of shit.

GRIFFIN
Put the gun down.

The gun wobbles in Campbell's hand. His breath races.

INT. WAREHOUSE, FOURTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

S.W.A.T. Officers race down the fourth floor hallway.

INT. LIVE/WORK SPACE - CONTINUOUS
The stand off continues.
GRIFFIN

He can't do it. He'd be killing

you and held never be able to

live with that.
Griffin kneels and picks up his pistol. He holds it in
one hand and the candle in the other. He aims the pistol
at Campbell.

GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
Put it down.

POLLY
Shoot him! He'll kill me
anyway!

Campbell starts to lower the shotgun.

POLLY (CONT'D)
NO!

CRASH! The door bursts open under the force of a
battering ram. S.W.A.T. officers surge into the room.

Griffin wheels around and shoots at the S.W.A.T. Team.

Campbell raises the shotgun and takes aim. BOOM!
SUPER SLOW MOTION as Griffin's hand and much of his
forearm disintegrate. The impact snuffs out the lit
candle, half of which flies through the air harmlessly.

Griffin wheels back around, taking aim at Campbell.
BOOM! His chest opens up as Campbell shoots him again.

Griffin's face grows slack with death as his body hurls
through the air.

Campbell's eyes focus on the remaining lit candles. He
drops the shotgun and before Griffin even lands, Campbell
begins running toward Polly, his feet splashing heavily
through the kerosene, his bad leg hindering his progress.

As Griffin's back THUMPS flatly in the pool, Campbell
watches a wave of kerosene radiate out from under his
body. The wave rolls away from him and toward the other
candles.

Campbell reaches Polly and without breaking stride,
scoops her up (chair and all). The wave of kerosene
reaches the candles, all of which fall at approximately
the same time.

As the flames hit, a bright ring of fire SPRINGS UP and
races in from the perimeter of the pool, closing in on
Campbell.

An instant before the wall of flame overtakes him, he
SMASHES through the outer window.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cops and agents wheel around when they hear glass shatter
and watch as Campbell and Polly soar through the air and

SPLASH into the river, flames roaring out behind them.

UNDERWATER CAMERA - picks up Campbell and Polly as they
thump into the freezing river.

Blood from Campbell's leg plums in the water. He
immediately swims toward Polly who sinks like a brick. He
grabs her and heads to the surface.

INT. WAREHOUSE, FIFTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Hollis, Ibby, and Mitch rush towards the room. They push
their way past the other cops and look in.
The room is ablaze and filled with smoke.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Campbell and Polly both come up gasping for air.

CAMPBELL
Are you okay?

POLLY
(spitting water)
Yeah Yeah. I'm okay.

AGGHHHH! - Polly and Campbell look up and cower as
Griffin, completely ablaze, leaps from the window and
plunges into the water right beside them.

UNDERWATER CAMERA - as Griffin breaks the surface and the
flames are immediately snuffed out.

Back on the surface, Campbell and Polly desperately scan
the water around them, waiting for him to resurface. On
the bank, several COPS have pulled their weapons, also
waiting for him to resurface. For a long moment, there
is no sign of him. Campbell tries to swim toward the
bank. TWO COPS dive in and help. They take Polly from
him just as Campbell sees Griffin's body bob to the
surface nearby, motionless.

The cops fish Polly out of the water, but Campbell can't
help but make sure Griffin is really dead. He swims a
few feet toward the body, which is still face down.

Campbell reaches tentatively for Griffin's shoulder and
rolls him over revealing that his face has been horribly
burned beyond recognition and that he is in fact, dead.

Campbell's voice is heard.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
Like I said, it's never that
easy. The best we can do is
hope he fucks up and do what we
can to be there when he does.

Campbell turns and swims toward the bank.

CAMPBELL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
It's been six months, you know?
INT. POLLY'S BUILDING, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Polly and Campbell step out of the elevator. She carries
her briefcase. He carries a bag of groceries.

POLLY
What's your point?

They reach her door and she unlocks three dead-bolts.

CAMPBELL
I'm just saying you still seem a
little paranoid. Maybe you
should see someone about this.

She opens the door and they step inside.

INT. POLLY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

They step inside and are greeted by an enormous
Rottweiler. Campbell pats its big head roughly.

POLLY
(playfully annoyed)
I am not paranoid.

She says as she disarms the security system.

CAMPBELL
No definitely not.

Campbell walks through the rest of the apartment, turning
on all the lights and checking all the rooms.

POLLY
Okay, so I have a few issues
with personal security. But I
think that's pretty
understandable, given the
circumstances, don't you?

CAMPBELL
(calling from down the
hall)
Definitely.

He walks back into the living room.
CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Well, all clear. Once again.

She walks him to the door.

POLLY
Thanks, Campbell.

CAMPBELL
It's the least I can do, don't
you think?

POLLY
Good night.

EXT. POLLY'S BUILDING, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Polly closes the door behind Campbell and he grins as she
bolts about fifteen different locks and chains. He walks
to the elevator and pushes the down button and waits.

After a moment he hears the bolts and chains again. The
door opens and Polly steps into the hallway.

POLLY
Actually, I thought of something
else you can do for me.

CAMPBELL
What's that?

The elevator door pings open.
POLLY
Have dinner with me. I hate

eating alone.

CAMPBELL
Me too.

He starts to walk toward her.

They go back inside and the bolts and chains start
banging and clicking again.

FADE OUT
