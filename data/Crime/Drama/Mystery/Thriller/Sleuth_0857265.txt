ANDREW
Yes?

MILO
Andrew Wyke?

ANDREW
That's right.

MILO
I'm Milo Tindle.

ANDREW
Oh yes. Good. Glad to meet you.

He offers his hand.,MILO takes it.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
You got the train to Charlebury,
did you?

MILO
I drove.

ANDREW
Oh, you drove?

MILO
That's my car.

ANDREW
What, the little one?

MILO
Not the big one.

ANDREW
No. The big one's mine. What do you
think of it?

MAN
Very handsome.

ANDREW
It is, isn't it? Come in.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - HALL AREA - DUSK 26
They come in. ANDREW closes the door.

ANDREW
Didn't hear you arrive. I was
watching the video of one of my
books on television.

MILO stops and stares.

INT, ANDREW'S HOUSE - DUSK: MILO'S Pov. 27

The interior design of the house is in total contrast to
the classic Georgian facade. It is sharply contemporary:
polished wooden floors, no carpets, chrome surfaces,
steel and iron verticals, an elevator in a glass case, a
curved staircase. A skylight, high up.

ANDREW
Like the house?

MILO
Extraordinary.

ANDREW
You know who designed it? You know
who the interior decorator was?

MILO
Yes. Your wife.

ANDREW
You knew.

MILO

Yes. I knew.

ANDREW
I'll show you around later. You
good in elevators?

MILO
What?
ANDREW
Like not safe in taxis. Sorry.
(he laughs)

Only joking. Have a drink. I'm
drinking vodka.
MILO
Scotch, please.

ANDREW
Milo. What an interesting name.
You're a foreigner, I take it.

MILO
My father is Italian.

ANDREW
Milo sounds Hungarian.

MILO
Does it?

ANDREW
Here's your scotch. Cheers.

MILO
Cheers.

« ANDREW
You're sure your father isn't
Hungarian?

MILO
Well, if he is he's kept it a dead
secret for years.

MILO sits and drinks.

ANDREW

And your mother?
MILO

English.
ANDREW

So you're a kind of half breed? Sit

down .

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - SEATING AREA - DUSK 28

MILO

Thanks for agreeing to see me.

ANDREW
Not at all.
MILO
I didn't know you wrote plays for
television?

ANDREW
I don't. I write crime novels. You
must know that.

MILO
I had heard.

ANDREW
But sometimes they're adapted for
television by other people. You
know what the word adapted means, I
take it?

MILO
Adapted?

ANDREW
Yes. They may not have such a word
in Italian.

MILO
I speak English.

ANDREW
Oh good. Come and have a look at my
special bookcase.

ANDREW presses a button on his remote control. A wall
moves and turns, revealing a bookcase.

29 INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - BOOKCASE AREA - DUSK

ANDREW (CONT'D)
These are all my novels. You've
read them, I suppose?

MILO.
Afraid not.

ANDREW
No? Good God. What about this one?
‘Rat in a Trap'.

MILO
No.
ANDREW
'The Obelisk'?

MILO
No.

ANDREW
‘Dead Fish'?

MILO
No.

ANDREW
"Blackout '?

MILO
Afraid not.

ANDREW
You're one in a million.

MILO
Am I? .

ANDREW
Absolutely. I'm very popular. See
this shelf. Translations. German,
French, Dutch --

MILO
You speak Dutch yourself, do you?

ANDREW
Yes. How did you know? I have a
Dutch uncle.

MILO
Can't see any Italian translations.

ANDREW
No. They're a funny lot, the
Italians. Culture isn't really
their thing.

MILO
Their salami is good, though.

ANDREW
Oh is it?

MILO
Italian salami. Best in the world.
ANDREW
Did you bring any with you?

MILO
No. I left it at home.

ANDREW
Shame.

MILO
We're going to have it for supper
tonight, with a couple of bottles
of Valpolicella.

ANDREW
We?

MILO
Maggie and me.

ANDREW
Ah. Your glass is empty. What are
you drinking. Vodka?

MILO
Scotch.

30 INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - BAR AREA - DUSK 30
ANDREW pours two drinks.

MILO (CONT'D)
I want to come to the point.

ANDREW
Point? What point?

MILO
Are you going to give Maggie a
divorce? And if not why not?

ANDREW
Yes, yes, we'll come to that.

MILO
She thinks you're being
unreasonable. So do I. She's never
coming back to you, so why not give
her the divorce?
10.

ANDREW
I think it’'1l do her good to wait
five years. Good for her character.

MILO
You're going to make her wait five
years?

ANDREW
That's the law. The law of the
land.

MILO

But that's pure spite.

ANDREW
Anyway, we'll come back to it.
Perhaps. Have your drink first.

ANDREW gives MILO his drink.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
What do you do, by the way?

MILO
I'm an actor.

ANDREW
Good God, are you really? I thought
Maggie said you were a hairdresser.

MILO
She must have been talking about
someone else.

ANDREW
You mean another friend?

MILO
Another friend?

ANDREW
She tends to have more than one
friend.

MILO
Does she?

ANDREW
Oh yes.
11.

MILO
I'm her only friend.
ANDREW
She must be lonely.
MILO
She's not.
ANDREW

Acting is a pretty precarious
profession isn't it? What are you
acting in at the moment?

MILO
I'm out of work.

ANDREW
Poor chap.

MILO
I drive cars now and again.
Chauffeuring.

ANDREW
Tough life.

MILO
I keep my head above water.

ANDREW
What kind of parts do you play?
MILO
Killers mostly. Sex maniacs.
Perverts.
ANDREW

But you seem so charming.

MILO
Yes. I know. Anyway, what about
this divorce? What's your position
exactly?

ANDREW
All in good time. I want to check
something out first.

ANDREW presses a button on his remote control. A wall
moves and discloses another room.
31

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Come in.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - STUDY - DUSK

ANDREW walks into the room,
this sequence, we are aware of the exterior light

finally fading to Night.

ANDREW
How do you like it?

MILO
Like what?

ANDREW

My study. This is where I write my

best selling books.

MILO looks around the room.

MILO sits.

» MILO
Cosy.

ANDREW
Take a seat. Make yourself
comfortable.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
I understand you're fucking my
wife.

MILO
That's right.

ANDREW

Right. Yes. Right. So we've cleared

that up.

MILO
We have.

ANDREW

I thought you might have denied it.

MILO
Why would I deny it?

followed by MILO. During
13.

ANDREW
Well, she is my wife.

MILO
Yes, but she's fucking me.

ANDREW
Oh, she's fucking you too? Well
I'll be buggered--sorry!

MILO
Yes, it's mutual.

ANDREW
You take turns, do you?

MILO
We fuck each other. That's what
people do.

ANDREW

Yes, yes, all right. I follow.

MILO
We're in love.

ANDREW
In what? Oh, love. So you're in
love?

MILO
That's right.

ANDREW
Let me know top you up.

He pours more whisky.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
I heard a rumour that you want to
marry her. That can't be right, can
it?

MILO
Why not?

ANDREW
In this day and age? Is marriage
absolutely necessary? Isn't it a
bit old hat?
14.

MILO
Is it?

ANDREW
It's a mugs game. I wouldn't go
near it if I were you. Anyway you
can't marry her. You can't marry
her because she's married to me.
Unless I divorce her, of course.

MILO
And are you?

ANDREW
Am I what?

MILO

Going to divorce her. Or are you
really going to make her wait five
years? She wants to know.

ANDREW
To be honest, I can't wait to get
rid of her. But I do need to get
one or two things straight first.
For example, I've never heard of an
Italian called Tindle.

MILO
My father's name is Tindolini.

ANDREW
Now that's lovely. Like a little
bell. I'd go back to Tindolini if I
were you. It suits you.

MILO
You think so?

ANDREW
So that if and when you marry
Maggie she'd be called Maggie
Tindolini. She'd get a real kick
out of that. Do you act under the
name of Tindle or Tindolini?

MILO
Tindle.

ANDREW
Why have I never heard of you?
32

33

34

15.

MILO
You will. Before long.
ANDREW
Really?
MILO
In spades.
ANDREW
That sounds threatening.
MILO
Does it?
ANDREW
Doesn't it?
MILO
Why don't we get down to brass
tacks?
~ ANDREW

Yes. Brass tacks, brass tacks, yes,
why not? This is the way I see it.
Come upstairs, I want to show you
something. Would you like to try
the elevator? It won't make you
sick or anything, will it?

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 32

They walk to the elevator and get in.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - ELEVATOR - NIGHT 33

They stand in silence as the elevator goes up to the top
floor. It stops. They get out.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 34

ANDREW
This is our bedroom.

ANDREW uses his remote control. A wall moves, revealing
the dressing room.
16.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
And this is her dressing room.

He opens a wardrobe.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
She's left a few dresses here.
Can't even be bothered to pick them
up. Worth thousands, thousands.
That leather coat alone cost two
thousand quid. No, you see, the
thing is this--sit down--you see,
the thing is this--my wife spends
money like water. If you're not
careful she'll eat you out of house
and home. She was born to luxury.
Jamaica, the Ritz, the Swiss Alps.
I mean, what are you? You're an out
of work actor, a part time
chauffeur. You're out of your
depth, old boy. You're on a hiding
to nothing. You think you're broke
now but you'll be ten times broker
by the time she's finished with
you. She'll have your guts for
garters.

MILO
She's in love with me.

ANDREW
Never trust in love, chum. Love'1i
kick you up the arse as soon as
look at you. Take it from me. First
it's love, ten minutes later it's
contempt.

MILO
That's your own experience, is it?

ANDREW
Certainly not. Observation. Don't
forget I'm a novelist. I observe
other people.

He goes to the window and looks out. MILO watches him--
silence.
17.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
What I'm getting at is this. You
won't be able to give her what she
wants so she'll leave you and come
back to me. But I don't want her
near me. She's the last thing I
want. I've had her up to here.
Anyway, I've got a lovely mistress.
She runs a Sauna in Swindon. She's
my girl. So you see, I want Maggie
to stay with you. I want you two to
stay together forever, but unless
you listen to me the whole thing
will be a fucking disaster with
catastrophic consequences all
round. But I have a solution.

MILO
You won't believe what I'm going to
say.

ANDREW
What are you going to say?

MILO
I'm all ears.

ANDREW
You know what? I'm beginning to
respond to your charm.

MILO
Get away.

ANDREW
It's true.

MILO

I'm really touched.

ANDREW
You should be. Tell me something
else. I bet you didn't expect me to
be so intelligent, so quick witted.
Did you?

MILO
Oh, I did, quite.

ANDREW
Maggie told you, did she?
35

36

37

MILO
What's your solution?

ANDREW
Vodka.

He goes to the door. MILO stands, follows.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
The elevator goes down. ANDREW smiles at MILO.

ANDREW
It's a close fit, isn't it, for
two?

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

The elevator stops. They get out.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE’ - BAR AREA - NIGHT
ANDREW pours drinks.

ANDREW
Listen. I'm going to make you a
proposition. A few years ago I gave
her some jewels. Amazingly
expensive. Well, I didn't give them
to her. I own them. They're insured
in my name. But I let her wear them-
-on special occasions. They're
worth half a million pounds. They
spend half their time in the bank
or in my safe. At the moment
they're in the safe in this house.
I want you to steal them.

Silence.

MILO
Steal them?

ANDREW
That's right.

MILO
What the hell do you mean?

rg.

35

36

37
19.

ANDREW
I mean I want you to steal the
jewels.

MILO

You want me to steal the jewels.

ANDREW
That's right.

MILO
I don't get it.

ANDREW
It's very simple. Steal them. Sell
them abroad. Live happily ever
after with Maggie. I'll claim the
insurance money--they'1ll have to
pay up. I'll have got rid of my
wife and I'll be as happy as a pig
in shit and you can keep Maggie in
the manner to which she has become
accustometi. Sounds like a fair
bargain to me.

MILO
You want me to take part ina
scummy little plot to defraud your
insurance company? Is that it?

ANDREW
Scummy? I think it's quite elegant.

MILO
What do you think I am? I mean,
what the fuck are you actually
talking about?

ANDREW
Real facts.

MILO
This is a joke.

ANDREW
No it isn't.

MILO
It's also a trap.

ANDREW
A trap?
20.

MILO
Yes, it's some kind of trap. You
think I'm a fool?

ANDREW
Well, are you?

MILO
Anyway, it doesn't hold up.

ANDREW
Why not?

MILO
You say they're worth half a
million pounds?

ANDREW
Correct.

MILO
Well, you'd only get a fraction of
that--fram any fence.

ANDREW
I've already contacted a friend of
mine in Amsterdam. He'll give you
£400,000 tax free. Think of it.
£400,000 tax free.

MILO
Why would he do that?

ANDREW
Because when you steal the jewels
you also steal the receipts. So
he'll have the title to the jewels
as well as the jewels themselves.
So when he sells them he'll get the
full value. Get it? Think about it.
Take your time.

Pause.

38 INT, ANDREW'S HOUSE - SEATING AREA - NIGHT 38

MILO
And why would you do all this?
21.

ANDREW

Listen. Under my crooked exterior
I'm a simple honest man. What I've
said to you is true. I swear it. I
want to get rid of my wife. But I
want it to be solid--permanent. I
don't want her on my back. I want
her to stay on your back.

MILO
This is a frame up.

ANDREW
Frame up? How?

MILO
You want to destroy me. You want to
see me in jail. You get me to do
this and then shop me to the
police.

ANDREW

No, no. Tf I shop you you'll shop
me. So we'd both end up in jail.
No, listen. I take a strictly moral
position in all this. My wife is an
adulteress. She should actually be
stoned to death. But anyway, it's
up to you. Make up your own mind.

MILO
Are you asking me to trust you?

ANDREW
I don't give a fuck if you trust me
or not. This is a very simple
proposition. You have an expensive
woman and no money. If you want to
keep her--steal the jewels.

MILO
Why don't you steal the jewels and
give them to me?

ANDREW
Don't be silly. The burglary has to
look real. The house has to be
broken in to.

MILO
Well, why don't you break into it?
22.

ANDREW
For Christ's sake. I'm in it. How
can I break into it? I live here.

39 INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - BACK WINDOW AREA - NIGHT 39
MILO walks to the window. He looks out. ANDREW watches
him.
MILO
(slowly)

Ok. If I were to agree to do this,
would you agree to the divorce?

ANDREW
Why would I agree to the divorce if
you're both walking away with
£400,000?

MILO
She wants a legal settlement. She
wants pazt of your estate.

ANDREW
Greedy.

MILO
It's legal justice.

ANDREW
Never trust legal justice. You know
what legal justice is? It's farting
Annie Laurie down a key hole.
Listen. £400,000 tax free. All
yours. Cash. Why don't you stop
pissing about?

MILO
But--wait a minute--you get
£500,000--from the insurance.

ANDREW
Sure I do. All right. I'll be
frank. I need it. Cash flow. Stocks
and shares going down the drain.
Get me? It's quid pro quo. You do
me a favour--I do you a favour. And
you keep the woman.

MILO sips his drink.
23.

MILO

OK. Let's make a deal.
ANDREW

What deal?
MILO

I break in, I steal the jewels and
you agree to the divorce. That's
the deal. Otherwise fuck it. That's
another quid pro quo. But you have
to shake on it.

ANDREW stares at him.

ANDREW
(slowly)
All right. I shake on it. Here's my
hand.
They shake hands.
Silence. -
MILO

OK. OK. So what do I do?

ANDREW
You break in. See that skylight?
It's the only window in the house
the burglar alarm doesn't touch.
You get in there.

MILO
It's pretty high up.

ANDREW
You climb a ladder.

MILO
I'm not very good at heights.

ANDREW
You can do it. Honestly. I know you
can.

MILO
I think you're putting me on.

ANDREW
Oh, come on. Behave like a man. A
man of action.

(MORE)
24.

ANDREW(CONT'D)
You don't have to be a hairdresser
for the rest of your life. You can
be free, independent, and look
after the woman you love.

He goes to a cupboard and takes out two pairs of
earphones with microphone attachments.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Put these on. I use them to give my
gardener his instructions.

MILO looks at the earphones.

MILO
Put them on?

ANDREW
Put them on. You put yours on and
I'il put mine on. Like this.

They both put on the earphones.

» ANDREW (CONT'D)

That's it. Actually they suit you.
Now what you do is this. You go
outside. There's a shed across the
lawn. In that shed is a ladder. You
put the ladder up against the house
and climb up it. I'll direct you--
through the earphones. You with me?

MILO
Yes. But I'm anxious and
frightened.

ANDREW
Trust me.

MILO
But I don't.

ANDREW
Trust me. All will be well. Just
follow my advice. It's got to look
real. It's got to convince the
imsurance people and the police.
See what I mean?

MILO
Maggie never told me you were
such...a manipulator.

(MORE)
25.

MILO(CONT'D)
She told me you were no good in bed
but she never told me you were such
a manipulator.

ANDREW
She told you I was no good in bed?
MILO
Oh yes.
ANDREW
She was joking. I'm wonderful in
bed.
MILO

I must tell her.

40 INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT 40

They walk back into ANDREW's study. There is a bank of
TV screens on a wall/series of picture boxes on the
laptop. ANDREW presses a button and images of the
interior and exterier of the house come up on all the
screens.

ANDREW
There's the shed. Just across the
lawn. Go into the shed and get the
ladder.

MILO
Get the ladder?

ANDREW
Get the ladder. By the ladder
there's a pair of gardening gloves.
Put them on. Also by the ladder
there's a hammer. Carry the hammer
up the ladder. Break the window
with the hammer. Then you reach in
and lift the latch.

41 INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - BACK WINDOW AREA - NIGHT 41

MILO walks back out into the main room, by the back
windows and looks at the skylight directly above.

MILO
Wait a minute. You've forgotten a
major item.
26.

ANDREW
What?

MILO
Once I'm in, how do I get down? How
do I get down to floor level?

ANDREW
Oh, didn't I tell you? So sorry.

He point high up the wall.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
You see that metal rung up there.
That's an electric ladder. When you
come through the window, stand on
the ledge. I'll press a button and
the ladder will descend. You get on
it and climb down.

MILO
Let me see it descend.
ANDREW
What?
MILO

Let me see it come down. Now.

ANDREW
Sure.

ANDREW presses the button. The ladder begins to extend
and comes down.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
You see? Easy as pissing.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
I have a funny feeling that I'ma
cunt.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Of course you're a cunt. But so
what? You'll end up a wealthy man.
Obey the rules. Just obey the
rules.

MILO
Whose rules?

Fantastic!

MILO
Where's the ladder?

ANDREW
What ladder?

MILO
The ladder! Where's it gone?

ANDREW
You're right. Where has it gone?
It's got a mind of its own, that
ladder. Wait a minute.

ANDREW presses a button. Nothing happens.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Oh dear. It's not working. This
fuse has always been a bit dodgy.

He presses the button again.

No, it's not working.

MILO
It's not working?

ANDREW
There seems to be--what's the word--
a problem. But don't worry. I'll
call the electrician in the

In the morning? What about now?

No, no. He's in bed. You know

You will. Don't worry.

You were playing with me. You're a

No, no. It was just a little game.
That's all. I thought it might

You did, eh? OK. So what the fuck
do I do now?

You open the safe.

Where is it? How do I open it?

MILO pushes dresses aside and peers into the wardrobe.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Kick the place to death. You're a
desperate man.

MILO looks around the room. There are a number of small
paintings on the walls.

MILO
Safe's are always kept behind
paintings, aren't they?

He lifts a painting from the wall. There is no safe. He
throws the painting at the wall.

That's my Picasso! What are you
doing?

I'm a desperate man. Isn't that

That's no Picasso. It's a fake.

MILO walks towards another painting.

He throws the painting against the wall.

And then?

I attack you.

MILO
How?

Like this.

ANDREW hits him in the stomach.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
And like this.

He hits him again in the stomach.

ANDREW throws another punch. MILO sidesteps and hits
ANDREW in the stomach.

ANDREW
Jesus, that hurt.

MILO
So sorry.

ANDREW
All right. Take out your knife.

MILO
I don't have a knife.

ANDREW
I do.

He opens the desk drawer and takes out a knife.
36.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Look. You threaten me with this
knife.

MILO
You're threatening me.

ANDREW
No no. I am you. I'm playing you.
This is what you do. You want to
know where the safe is and what the
combination is so you terrorize me
with this knife.

He pokes MILO with the knife.

MILO
Take it easy.

He pokes MILO again.

ANDREW
You can see I'm ruthless. I mean,
I'm obviously unpredictable. I'm
probably a killer. I'm certainly
very dangerous. But you're
obstinate.

MILO
Me, or you?

ANDREW
No, you're me, I'm you. Get it?
That jewellery is worth a lot of
money. You won't give in. So I take
out my gun--I'm still you, by the
way.

He takes a gun from the desk drawer.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
And just to make it clear that I
mean business I show you I know how
to use the gun.

He shoots at the photograph hanging on the wall of
Maggie and himself in the swimming pool. It smashes.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Bulls eye.

He shoots at the other photograph hanging on the wall of
Maggie and himself in the Lake District. It smashes.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Bulls eye. So finally you give in.
You're terrified. You show me where
the safe is.

He leads MILO to a fish tank.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
It's behind that.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 65

He presses a button. The fish tank descends into the
floor. A safe is revealed.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
There you are. Magic. So you're so
frightened you tell me the
combination. 1911 9 4. Go on,
open it.

MILO
Wait a minute. Am I me now? Or am I
you? Or are you still me?

ANDREW
No, you're now you. I'm now me.
Open the safe.

MILO
(muttering)
191194.

ANDREW
It's our wedding day. 19th
November, 1994.

MILO dials the combination, opens the safe and takes out
the box containing the jewellery. He opens it. Antique
jewellery, diamonds, rubies etc.

MILO
Jesus!

ANDREW
What do you think?
38.

MILO
They're quite...beautiful.

ANDREW
Put them in your pocket.

MILO
£400,000 eh?

ANDREW
That's what I said.

MILO puts the jewels in his pocket. He looks at ANDREW.
ANDREW is still holding the gun.

MILO
OK. So far so good. Well, you'd
better give me the address of that

fence.
ANDREW
What fence?
MILO
The fence in Amsterdam.
ANDREW
Oh yes. That fence.
MILO
Listen. Do you mind putting that
gun down?
ANDREW
Why?
MILO

It's pointing directly at me. I'm
not very happy about it.

ANDREW
Why not?

MILO
Look. Is this a game?

ANDREW
This is the real game. The real
game has just begun.

MILO
What's the real game?

ANDREW
You and me. You defenceless, me
with a gun. This is the end of the
jewellery story, you see.

Oh is it?

ANDREW
I enjoyed it though.

MILO
I'm not enjoying this.

ANDREW
I don't blame you.

MILO
What's it all about?

ANDREW
Come on. Buck your ideas up. Did
you really think I would let you
have my wife and the jewels? You're

joking.
MILO
You've been leading me up the
garden.
ANDREW
Right up. Stand in the centre of

MILO does so. ANDREW turns the lights out, leaving one
spotlight on MILO.

MILO
Listen, wait a minute. Before we go
any further--there's something I
must tell you.

ANDREW
What?

MILO
Maggie respects you.

ANDREW
Really?

MILO
Yes. She often says you're a man of
true integrity. That you're a
really decent guy.

ANDREW
She's right. I am a really decent
guy.

MILO

I believe it.

ANDREW
Yes, she's quite right, I ama
really decent guy.

MILO
I know you are. I know you are. And
that's what she says. She admires
your mind.

ANDREW
She admires my mind.

MILO

Yes. Your mind excites her.

Sexually?
MILO

Oh very. Your mind excites your
wife sexually.

ANDREW
What about my bedy?

MILO
Sorry? What?

ANDREW
My body. What akout my body?

MILO
What about it?

ANDREW
What about my body? What does she
say about my body?

MILO
Do you know, I don't think she's
ever mentioned it.

ANDREW
You're a prick.

MILO
My prick? Where does my prick come
into it?

ANDREW
I can guess where your prick comes
into it. But I wasn't talking about
your prick. I just called you a

prick.

MILO
Oh thanks.

ANDREW
But you know what you are now
though? *

MILO
What?

ANDREW
You're a dead duck.

MILO
Really?

ANDREW

Oh yes. You see this is how the
story goes. To the police. I found
you in my house. You threatened me
with a gun. You opened the safe,
found the jewels, put them in your
pocket. But I managed to grab the
gun as you were looking at the
jewels. There was a struggle. The
gun went off. I suddenly realised
you were dead. That I had shot you.
I suddenly realised you were dead.

MILO
You're going to shoot me?

ANDREW
What do you think?
67

42.

MILO
Why?

ANDREW
I planned all this, you see, from
the word go. I've always longed to
have an intimate chat with a
hairdresser, particularly a
hairdresser who is fucking my wife.

MILO
I'm not a hairdresser.

ANDREW
Yes you are. So I thought a little
fun would be good for my health. A
little game. You see, what you
forget is that my wife is mine. She
belongs to me. I'm her husband. So
what you did was this. You invited
yourself here to attend your own
death.
MILO

(shivering)
Don't do it. Listen. Don't do it.
Don't shoot. Please. Don't shoot
me. Please. I'll just go away--
quietly. I'll just get into my car
and go. That's all. You'll never
see me again. Ok? Don't shoot.
Don't use that gun. Please. You're
crazy. No--you're not crazy. You've
just got things wrong. Totally. I
don't want your wife. I hate women.
You understand? I hate women. I
hate your wife. You've absolutely
no reason to be jealous. Women are
not my scene. I'd rather do it with
a dog, or a goat, or a boy I knew
at school. His name was Dooley. I
called him Dolores. I hate women.
Honestly. God's honour. Do you
believe in God?

ANDREW shoots him. MILO falls.

No.

Ask.

You do know your wife is living in

ANDREW
That's my business. My private life
is my private business.

Do you know the name of this man?

Why should I answer these
questions?

BLACK
Well you don't have to. But you'd
be better off if you did.

I don't know the man's name. I've
never asked.

So you admit that your wife is
living in London with another man?

Yes. Yes. So what?

Well I can tell you the man's name.
It's Tindle. Milo Tindle.

You forgot earlier. You said you
didn't know him. You said you'd
never heard of him.

Yes. They're a traditional Italian

I think he is.

BLACK
He didn't come all the way down
here to do your hair, did he?

ANDREW
Oh not at all, not at all.

BLACK
So what did you two do when you got
together?

ANDREW
We played a game.

BLACK
A game?

ANDREW

A game with a knife and gun.

BLACK
A lethal game?

ANDREW
No no. Just a bit of fun, that's
all.

BLACK

OK. A bit of fun. He comes to see
you, you play games with a knife
and gun. Three shots are fired and
then he disappears. So where is he?

ANDREW
Probably cuddling my wife.

BLACK
That's the one thing he's not
doing.

ANDREW
How do you know?

BLACK
I've seen her. He was nowhere in
sight. She's an anxious woman. She
knew he was coming to see you, you
see. In fact she insisted that he
came to see you, as I know you
know. She thinks you may have
killed him. She thinks you're round
the bend. She thinks you're a very
dangerous man.

ANDREW
Me? She's joking.

BLACK
So tell me, between ourselves, did
you kill him?

ANDREW
I'll tell you exactly what I did. I
pretended to kill him. I shot him
with a blank. I frightened the shit
out of him. Your man was right.
Your spy--or whatever he was. There
were three shots. The first two
were real, the third a blank. He
was terrified. When I shot him he
fainted. When he woke up I gave him
a drink and a pat on the bum.

(MORE)
57.

ANDREW(CONT'D)
He left the house, his tail--if you
want to call it that--between his
legs. I haven't seen him since.

BLACK
You gave him a pat on the bum?

ANDREW
Metaphorically.

BLACK
You gave him a metaphorical pat on
the bum?

ANDREW
Sure.

BLACK
How did he take it?

ANDREW
What?
~ BLACK
The pat.
ANDREW

Oh he's a good sport. He told me it
was game set and match to me.

BLACK
So this guy had a sense of humour?
Is that what you're saying?

ANDREW
Oh yes. Oh yes, he left this house
with a twinkle in his eye.

BLACK
So, tell me--whaz was the point of
all of this?

ANDREW
Humiliation. It's nice to see your
wife's lover a shivering,
frightened, fucking wreck in front
of you. But as a matter of fact I
quite liked him. I found him
attractive. I thought we might
become good friends. The shortest
way to a man's heart is, as I'm
sure you know, humiliation. It
binds you together.
58.

BLACK
You found him attractive?

ANDREW
I was trying to stand in my wife's
shoes, in a manner of speaking. I
was trying to find out what
attracted her to him.

BLACK
And did you?

ANDREW
Oh yes. He was really terribly
sweet. I could see why she fancied
him.

BLACK
I could see why he fancies her. I
thought she was very tasty myself.

ANDREW
Really? +
BLACK
Oh yes. Sumptuous. Ready for
action.
ANDREW
Is that so?
BLACK

Oh yes. I mean, I'm an experienced
detective. So guess what I
detected?

ANDREW
What ?

BLACK
That she's in love with her own
body. It makes her dizzy with
excitement.

ANDREW
You detected this in five minutes?

BLACK
Well, thirty-five. Or lets call it
forty-five. Perhaps even fifty-
five. Or even a bit longer.
59.

ANDREW
You stayed for tea?

BLACK
And cakes. Yes, must be funny for
you to know your own wife is being
given a good going-over by another
man on a regular basis.

ANDREW
A good going-over? I don't quite
follow you.

BLACK
You don't?

ANDREW
It's not a phrase I'm familiar
with.

BLACK

It means being fucked.

ANDREW
Oh, you mean like in sexual
intercourse?

BLACK

Yes, the old one two. In like a
lion and out like a lamb.

ANDREW
I must say you have a great gift
for language. Did you learn it at
school?

BLACK
The hard school. Family life.

ANDREW
But you keep cheerful.

BLACK
You've got it. I keep cheerful.
I've got an optimistic nature. Well
you have to if you're a policeman.
Otherwise you'd go mad. No, I'11
tell you what keeps me going. The
chase. The thrill of the hunt. And
the sudden shafts of bright light.

(MORE)
60.

BLACK(CONT'D)
For instance, when I was talking to
your wife--very attractive woman--
wonderful legs--she was crossing
them at a time I remember--she
suddenly said you had a murderous
nature--that really made my nose
twitch.

ANDREW
Itch?

BLACK

Twitch, mate. Twitch. So I'm
looking at you and wondering what
you've done with the body. What
have you done with the body?
Where's the body? Come on. I need
to know. Where's the body? What
have you done with the body?

ANDREW
There's no body.

~ BLACK
Don't fuck about. Don't bullshit
me. I won't stand for it. Where's
the body. In the house? Or did you
shift it?

ANDREW
There is no body.

91 INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 91

BLACK stands, looks about him and walks around the room.
He walks to the wall and examines it.

BLACK
Eh, look at this. You've got holes
in your wall. They're bullet holes.
Live bullet holes.

ANDREW
I fired two live bullets to set up
the trick and one blank to complete
it. It was a game. I told you. I
played it to the hilt. Not worth
playing a game if you don't play it
to the hilt.
61.

BLACK
So you're saying the third shot was
a blank?

ANDREW

That's right.

BLACK
What's this?

BLACK bends and touches the floor.

ANDREW
What?

BLACK
Blood.

ANDREW
Blood?

BLACK
Dried blood.

ANDREW
Where?

BLACK

Here. Right here. Some of it hasn't
even dried, it's still damp.

ANDREW
It's impossible.

BLACK
This is blood, chum. Whose blood is
it?

ANDREW
It's impossible. It was a game. It
was a blank.

BLACK
No no. It was a game with real
bullets and real blood.

ANDREW
This is a carve up.

BLACK
Lets see what else is new around
here.
He goes to a cupboard and opens it.

BLACK (CONT'D)
Hello, what's this?

He reaches into the cupboard.

BLACK (CONT'D)
You've got a shirt, jacket and
trousers screwed up at the back of
your cupboard. Very negligent of
you mate. Unless they're not yours.

He examines them.

BLACK (CONT'D)
No, I don't think they're yours. I
think they belong to Tindle. You
say he left the house after you
shot him?

ANDREW
Yes. -

BLACK
Naked?

ANDREW
I don't know...how those clothes
got there.

BLACK
So you made him strip before you
shot him? Part of the humiliation,
was it? No. The thing is this. It
might have started as a game but it
got out of hand. The third shot was
live, it killed him. So where's the
body?

ANDREW
I didn't kill him. He's alive.

BLACK
Bollocks.

BLACK moves very close to ANDREW and peers into his
face,
63.

BLACK (CONT'D)
You're a joker all right, aren't
you? A real joker. Come on. We're
off to the station.

ANDREW
There's something very wrong here.

BLACK
Dead right. I'll tell you what you
are. You're fucked.

BLACK takes him by his arm.

BLACK (CONT'D)
You're under arrest.

He takes him into the elevator.

They exit the elevator.

BLACK suddenly laughs. He takes off his wig.

He takes out his contact lenses, rips off his moustache,
takes off jacket and shoulder holster, opens shirt,
shows padding. He smiles at ANDREW. It is MILO.

ANDREW comes into the room and leans over MILO.

ANDREW
You all right, old boy?

MILO stares at him.

ANDREW (CONT'D)

All right? Just a bit deaf I
suppose. They do make such a noise.
Did you think you were dead?

(he laughs)
No you're not dead. It was a blank.
Do you remember? I shot you with a
blank. I just wanted to give you a
fright. It was a joke. I was
joking. Did you think I was really
going to kill you? No no. It was a
game, that's all. Like a drop of
brandy?

ANDREW goes and pours brandy, he gives it to him.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
Here you are. What a good sport you
are. A really good sport. Did I
give you a fright? So sorry.

MILO drinks. ANDREW raises his own glass.

~~ ANDREW (CONT'D)
Cheers.

MILO
You know, it's funny, you're
absolutely right, I really did
think I was dead.

ANDREW
That's what I wanted you to think.

MILO
You play a tough game.

ANDREW
It's the-only game worth playing.

MILO
Well listen, I'm grateful to you--
for not killing me.

ANDREW
It was a practical decision, that's
all. I mean, if I killed you I
would have to get rid of the body,
bury it in the garden or something.
Too exhausting and not very
efficient.

MILO
Yes, I see that.

ANDREW
Anyway, here you are, fit asa
fiddle.

MILO
Yes. Thanks. Listen. I think I'll
pop off, grab a cheese sandwich
somewhere.

Oh my goodness, you're right, you

They both laugh.

MILO taking off padding.

ANDREW
It's you!

MILO
It's me all right.

« ANDREW
You bastard. You shit. You stinking
bastard.

MILO
Just a little game, Andrew. Just a
little game. I thought it might
amuse you.

ANDREW
You're a total shit.

MILO
I know I am.

ANDREW
But you're also a genius.

MILO
I know that too.

He starts to put on his own clothes.
ANDREW
When did you do all this? The
clothes in the wardrobe? The blood?

MILO
The blood belongs to a pig's liver.
67.

ANDREW
But when did you do it? How did you
do it?

MILO

I did it last night. I used that
ladder. I heard you snoring.

ANDREW
Does Maggie know about all this?
About your Inspector? Was it her
idea? How much does she know?

MILO
She knows nothing about it.
Entirely my own idea. This is a
game between us, old boy. Between
you and me. Had to get some
revenge, you see. Don't forget I'm
half Italian. We go in for revenge.
After all, you frightened the life
out of me, deliberately. You fired
two live bullets into the wall and
then pointed the gun at me. And
then you fired. I don't like guns.
They kill you.

ANDREW
OK. So what does this make the
score? You've had your revenge, so
what do you reckon? One set all?

MILO

No no, you're way ahead. I just
teased you with my Inspector. Gave
you a few goose simples. But you
frightened me to death. So we're a
long way from one set all. I may be
three games up in the second set,
but you won the first six love.

ANDREW
Oh, by the way, I spoke to Maggie.
I told her all about you. She loved
it.

MILO
Loved what?

ANDREW
That I frightened the life out of
you. That you pissed your pants.

That you actually fainted. She
said: "You mean he actually

light." She laughed so much I
thought she was going to burst. Oh
and incidentally, she's coming back
to me.

MILO
Oh, is she?

ANDREW
That's right. You know what she
said about you?

MILO
What?

ANDREW
She said "Faint heart never won
fair lady".

« MILO
Is that a fact? Listen. I want to
show you something. Go into your

It's late at night. You're reading

ANDREW picks up a book and opens it.

MILO (CONT'D)
It's late at night. You're reading

MILO jumps off the ladder. He takes the gun out of the

The jewels. Where's the safe?

You know where it is.

No I don't.

Don't fuck me about. I mean it. Get
up.

ANDREW remains seated.

He shoots at a vase, it smashes.

Get up.

It's behind the fish tank. I have
to press this button to shift the

MILO
Then press it.

ANDREW
It's out of order. It's not
working.

MILO shoots at the fish tank. It smashes. Goldfish and
water pour out. The safe is revealed.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
You're crazy. You're a maniac.

MILO
Open it.
ANDREW
I changed the combination.
Yesterday.
MILO
What is it?
ANDREW
I've forgotten. I can't remember.
MILO
Remember.

It's the truth. I can't remember.
MILO points the gun at ANDREW.

MILO
Remember.

What are you doing? What are you
going to do?

MILO opens the gun, adjusts the chamber.

That's a good boy. So what are you
writing at the moment?

ANDREW
What am I writing?

MILO
Yes, I'm very interested in
literature. I'ma kind of artistic
thief.

Sure. It's your house.

I'm always interested in the people
I rob. Like I'm always interested
in the husbands of the wives I
fuck.

ANDREW
Are you really? Well well. Cheers.

MILO
So what are you writing?

ANDREW
A story about a pathological
killer. I call it "The Smiling
Man".

MILO
Does he come to a bad end?

ANDREW
He dies during the act of love,
like countless others.

MILO
Countless others, eh? I can see
you've researched the subject
thoroughly.

ANDREW
What subject?

MILO
Death in orgasm.

ANDREW
Yes, it's a beautiful notion, isn't
it? To die in the arms of your
beloved. Can you imagine anything
more poignant?

MILO
I can't, no. You're a married man
yourself aren't you?
74.

ANDREW .
Oh, yes. Married ten years. It was
love at first sight.

MILO
Very moving.

ANDREW
Yes. And we're still in love. We're
like two peas in a pod.

MILO
Someone told me your wife has a
lover.

ANDREW

She has, yes.

MILO
Do you know him?

ANDREW
Never met. him. He's some kind of
Italian. Called Tandouri or
something.

MILO
One of the Bombay Tandouris?

ANDREW
You've got it. You know something?
I've never met an artistic burglar
before. Fascinating. What's your

background?

MILO

ANDREW
You.

MILO

Irish. Connemara. Spanish descent.
By way of Uganda. My grandparents
were slaves. My mother was a dark
eyed dusky beauty.

ANDREW
Were you breast fed?

MILO
Oh, sure. Like a baby. Shall I tell
you what I want you to do with
these jewels?

ANDREW
What?

Put this bracelet on your wrist.

MILO hands him a bracelet. ANDREW looks at it and slowly
slips it onto his wrist.

MILO (CONT'D)
Put these earrings on your ears.

MILO hands him a pair of earrings. ANDREW looks at the
earrings.

MILO (CONT'D)
They clip. Clip them. On your ears.
ANDREW clips them on to his ears.
MILO (CONT'D)
God, you look so charming. Now, put
this necklace round your neck.

MILO hands him a necklace. ANDREW puts it round his neck
but can't fix the clasp.

MILO (CONT'D)
Let me give you a hand.

MILO goes behind ANDREW and lifts the necklace.
MILO (CONT'D)
How do you want it? Like this? or
do you want it shorter?

He tightens the necklace.

MILO (CONT'D)
How about this?

He tightens the necklace.

MILO (CONT'D)
Or even shorter. Like a halter.

He tightens it round ANDREW's neck.

You're too much fun.

« MILO
Yes. You're wicked. I like that.

ANDREW glances into a small mirror.

ANDREW
You know something? I don't think
these earrings really suit me.

MILO
You're right. Take them off.

ANDREW takes them off.

ANDREW
I don't think the bracelet is quite
my style either.

MILO
But the necklace is nice.

ANDREW
I'm not totally sure.

He takes off the bracelet.
MILO
Listen, you can play about with
these jewels until the cows come
home. They're yours. Do what you
like with them.

ANDREW
But I thought you'd just stolen
them?

MILO
No, no. That was a game. Just a
game. I thought it might amuse you.

ANDREW
Well, you're the wicked one aren't
you?

MILO.
You remember what I said. You won
the first set six love and I was
three love up in the second. Well,
now it's ‘one set all.

ANDREW
But who's going to win the third
set?

MILO
Remains to be seen.

MILO
Some. Not all.

But you like being in charge--of
the game?

MILO
Oh yes. Sure.

charge of things.

think?

MILO

I have met her, yes.

Did she tell you she had a husband?

MILO
Yes, she said she had a husband.

Arrogant. Ruthless. Jealous.
Paranoid. Criminal tendencies.
Mentally unsound.

chardonnay is chilling in there at

How would you like it?

MILO
Me?

ANDREW
Yes. I think I've come to the
conclusion that you're my sort of
person,

MILO
Am I now?

ANDREW
I told you, I like your mind. I
find it exciting. I need
intellectual excitement,
intellectual stimulation.

MILO
They don't grow on trees.

ANDREW
I'm a rich man. What would you like
to do? I can subsidise anything you
want. You can open an art gallery
in the village. Or a bookshop. Or -
of course - a little theatre.
You're a wonderful actor. You could
choose all the plays and play all
the leading parts. But this would
be your home. And this would be
your bedroom.

MILO
You're asking me to live here?

ANDREW
I'm asking you to stay with me.
But, we'd also travel. Jamaica, the
Swiss Alps. I bet you're a great
skier. You could ski to your hearts
content and swim in the blue
Caribbean.

scotch on the rocks for you or a
glass of chilled Chilean
chardonnay. The world would be your
oyster.

She wants that divorce.

MILO stares at him.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
What do you think of my
proposition?

MILO
Well, I like the idea of Jamaica.
But what about Barbados?

ANDREW
And Barbados. And Antigua.

MILO
Yes, it's true. There are so many
places I haven't been. Hollywood.
St. Petersburg. The Cote D'Azur.
Coney Island. Oh, and I hear
there's a wonderful hotel in
Scotland called Balmoral.

Ah. So bed and breakfast is out.

Whatever you want. Whatever you
want. Whoever you want. I'll
introduce you te whoever you want.

MILO
Kissinger? Pinochet? Madonna? Mike
Tyson?

ANDREW
Yes.

MILO

Yes, I must say, that, as offers
go, it's quite tempting. You're a
naughty tempter, aren't you?
(pause)
I'm so glad you like my mind. Not
many people like my mind. Quite a
few people like my body but I can't
think of anyone who likes my mind.
That makes you unique. But then of
course you know what they say. The
mind is the body.

ANDREW
Is that what they say?

MILO
Well, somebody said something like
it once. Bullshit, of course.
Anyway - perhaps I am your sort of
person. Who knows? But you'd have
to be very nice to me. For
instance, just at this moment I
need a drink.
84.

ANDREW
You can get your own drink.

MILO -
No, darling. You get it for me and
then I might be nice to you.

ANDREW
Nice to me?

MILO
That's what I said. Whisky please.

ANDREW does not move.

MILO (CONT'D)
I can't deny that you might find me
a congenial companion. I really
can't deny it. I could be quite a
witty companion. Would you like a
witty companion?

~ ANDREW
Very much.

MILO
I'm particularly witty in the
morning. Would that suit you? Some
people hate wit in the morning.
What about you?

ANDREW
I love wit in the morning.

MILO
Over boiled eggs? Do you like eggs?

ANDREW
Absolutely.

MILO
Boiled or scrambled? I'm a dab hand
in the kitchen. But you'd have to
be nice to me and give me a drink
when I ask for it.

ANDREW pours a glass of whiskey and gives it to him.

MILO (CONT'D)
You see, you can be really sweet
when you put your mind to it, can't
you?

He drinks.
MILO {CONT'D)
Cheers. Listen, I can see what
you're saying. I can see why you're
inviting me to live with you. I can
see that you're lonely. You need
looking after. It's obvious. You
need someone who would cater for
your every whim. Don't you?
ANDREW
I do.
INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - GUEST SUITE - NIGHT 109
MILO's cell phone rings.

MILO
Hello.

He listens. “

MILO (CONT'D)
Darling.

He listens.

MILO (CONT'D)
What? What?

He listens.

MILO (CONT'D)
Oh is that so? Are you?

He listens.

MILO (CONT'D)
I see. Are you sure?

He listens.

MILO (CONT'D)
Uh-huh. I see.

He listens.

MILO (CONT'D)
I get it.
86.

He listens.
MILO (CONT'D)
I told you, I get it. I understand.
OK. Yes sure. OK.

He listens.

MILO (CONT'D)
OK. I'li tell him.

He puts the phone down.

ANDREW
Tell him what?

MILO grins.

MILO
That she loves you.

ANDREW
Is that so? What else did she say?

MILO
Nothing.

ANDREW
Nothing?

MILO
Nothing.

MILO and ANDREW stare at each other.

ANDREW
Listen! For Christ's sake make up
your mind! I'm offering you
something special. Something really
special. We can seal it with a
handshake. And then she'll be
nowhere. We cut her out. You
understand? We cut her out of our
lives. Don't let her dominate you.
Be yourself. Be independent. Be
free.

MILO
Like you?
87.

ANDREW
Yes, that's right. Be free. Like
me .

ANDREW's telephone rings. They both look at it. ANDREW does
not move. It stops ringing.

MILO
You know, I've always been
attracted by rich and powerful men.
Rich and powerful men make all the
girls quiver like a jelly on a
plate.

ANDREW
But you're not a girl.

MILO
Yes, it tickles the old cobblers,
money .

ANDREW
Girls dorf't have cobblers.

MILO
You'd be surprised.

ANDREW
But you're not a girl.

MILO
Well I may have been once, back in
the good old days.

ANDREW
Maybe the good old days are coming
back?

MILO

Who knows? Look. I'd really like to
see your bed. I mean let me be
quite clear - this looks a very
nice bed indeed, but yours is
bigger. Can I have another look at
it?

ANDREW
Sure.

MILO picks up ANDREW's remote control.

ge.

MILO
Is this how you do it?

He presses it. A wall moves, revealing the bedroom.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 110

MILO (CONT'D)
Miraculous! I could really get to
like this.

MILO walks towards the bed.

MILO (CONT'D)
Of course this is the marriage bed,
isn't it? Is this where she took
your virginity? Is this where your
wife deflowered you? Is this where
you were deflowered?

He sits on the bed.

MILO (CONT'D)
It's a lovely bed. So bouncy.

He takes off the shoulder holster and puts it down on a
side table. He lies down on the bed, rests his head on the
pillow.

MILO (CONT'D)
I'm so touched to be offered a
place in your heart, in your life.
I'm touched.
He smiles at ANDREW.
ANDREW stands still.
MILO smiles at ANDREW.

ANDREW slowly moves towards him. He strokes MILO's face,
tentatively.

ANDREW
You're beautiful.

He continues to stroke MILO's face. MILO speaks very
quietly.

MILO
Take your hand off me.
89.

ANDREW stops stroking.

MILO (CONT'D)
Take your hand off me.

MILO throws him off violently.

MILO (CONT'D)
Fuck off! Go and fuck yourself you
big pouff!

MILO gets off the bed.

MILO (CONT'D)
Jesus. I come here as an innocent
bystander, as a totally respectable
person - a humble, part time
hairdresser - and you try to
corrupt me. You try to seduce me.
You know what you are? You're a
menace. Also, you're a cunt.

They stare at each other.

ANDREW
Well, now you really are charming.

MILO
You know who's going to love this
story?

ANDREW
What story?

MILO
This one. This one.

ANDREW
Who?

MILO
Maggie.

ANDREW
Oh really?

MILO walks slowly to ANDREW, stands close to him and looks
into his eyes.

MILO
Oh by the way, she asked me to tell
you something.
ANDREW
What ?

MILO
She's coming back to you. She's on
her way.

ANDREW
She's coming back to me?

MILO
Yes. That's what she told me. On
the phone.

ANDREW
But I don't want her.

MILO
Well you've got her. She's all
yours. You're welcome to her. She
loves your money, baby. That's the
nub of it,

ANDREW
But I don't want her.
MILO goes to the wardrobe and takes out the leather coat.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
What are you doing with that coat?

MILO
I'm taking it. Tell Maggie I'll be
in touch. I want to have a drink
with her. I want to bring her up to
date.
MILO puts the coat over his shoulders.
MILO (CONT'D)
How do you like me in this coat?
Do you fancy me?
He goes to ANDREW and kisses him lightly on the mouth.

MILO (CONT'D)
Goodbye, darling.

MILO goes to the door.

ANDREW takes MILO's gun out of the holster.

gl.

ANDREW
Wait a minute.

MILO turns.

MILO
Yes? What?

ANDREW
Goodbye darling.

ANDREW shoots him.

After a few moments ANDREW walks across the room and stands

looking down at the dead body.
He stares at the dead body. His face is ashen, dead.

ANDREW remains still, staring down at MILO.

EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

A car turning slowly into the drive. A woman's hand
hanging out the widow, tapping the side of the car.

The car approaches the house.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM. - NIGHT

ANDREW hears the car. He turns, looks out of the window.

EXT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

The car stops. A woman's legs swinging out of the car.

INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANDREW staring out of the window.

THE END.
