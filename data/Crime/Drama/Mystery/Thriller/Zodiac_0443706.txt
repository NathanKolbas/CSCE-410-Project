FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 1.

FADE IN:

INT. CORVAIR -- NIGHT

Our camera is MOUNTED to a CAR WINDOW. Driving through a
small town at night. Passing white picket fences. Kids'
discarded big wheels. American flags flutter.

July 4th, 1969 - Summer of Love. Vallejo, California

FIREWORKS streak into the sky. Cookouts winding down. The
car slows. Stops in front of a house on Beechwood Avenue.
The driver HONKS. MIKE MAGEAU races out. Skinny at 19.
Runs up to the window. To the camera:

MIKE
Where have you been? I've been
waiting since seven.

At the wheel is DARLENE FERRIN, 22, clad in a WHITE AND BLUE
JUMPSUIT. Fake eyelashes and braces make her look like 17.

DARLENE
(good natured)
Get in, I'm starving. I haven't
eaten in like twenty four hours.

MIKE
Let me drive, then.

DARLENE
No way, Jose. I have to pick up
fireworks for the party tonight.
Food first though.

Mike doesn't move - he wants to drive.

DARLENE (CONT'D)
You coming or not?

EXT. MR. ED'S -- NIGHT

BOOM DOWN to see a local Vallejo teen hangout. Although the
60's are almost over, Vallejo didn't get the memo. Darlene

(still driving) and Mike, cruising through the crowded lot.

She sees something offscreen. Frowning, unnerved:

DARLENE
Screw this place.

MIKE
I thought you needed to eat.

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2.
CONTINUED:

DARLENE
We have time before the party. We
could just go talk.

Mike blinks at this. An opportunity...

EXT. BLUE ROCK SPRINGS -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

Minutes later. The Corvair pulls into the lot of the local
golf course. Make out point. The car on the road behind
them, passing, continuing on.

INT. DARLENE'S CAR -- NIGHT

Darlene, parking, checking the rearview to watch the car
pass. Tense, but relaxing as it goes. Mike, noticing.

MIKE
Are you okay?

DARLENE
(relaxing)
Fine.

MIKE
You seem a little funny.

She touches his chest, playfully.
DARLENE

It's July and how many shirts are
you wearing?

MIKE
(embarrassed)
I'm cold.
DARLENE

You're cold in July?

BANG-BANG-BANG! Mike and Darlene JUMP and Mike gives out a
scream! Looking around to see KIDS. A group of them in
three cars. Laughing, they toss another lit string of
fireworks towards the Corvair. BANG-BANG-BANG!

MIKE
Fuck off and die!

The kids PEEL OUT. Leaving Mike and Darlene alone. After a
moment, Darlene begins giggling. RELAXING.

MIKE (CONT'D)
What?

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 3.
CONTINUED:

DARLENE
(mimicking)
"Fuck off and die!"

She keeps laughing.

MIKE
Shut up...

But he's smiling. Soon he succumbs to the laughter as well.
He shifts closer. Then, through the windshield - HEADLIGHTS.
Signaling to turn into the lot. The car pulls to a halt
eight feet behind them on their left side. Turning out the
lights. But not the engine. Mike stares at the car. Only
one person in it. Odd for a make out spot.

MIKE (CONT'D)
Is that the car that was behind us
before?

Darlene doesn't respond.

MIKE (CONT'D)
(squinting)
It is, I think he's been with us
since my house- Shit, is that your
husband?

DARLENE
No.

But she can't take her eyes off the car. The driver makes no
move to get out...

MIKE
I can to tell him to leave-

She puts her hand over his. Looks at him. Don't move. They
wait for what seems an eternity. Then...

The other car PULLS FORWARD. Headlights click BACK ON.
Passing the Corvair. They watch it go, finally disappearing
over the horizon.

MIKE (CONT'D)
Who was that, Darlene?

DARLENE
Don't worry about it.

Mike studies her face. Unnerved.

MIKE
So... do you want to-

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 4.
CONTINUED: (2)

DARLENE
Oh, shit...

Through the windshield - HEADLIGHTS, COMING BACK over the
horizon. Darlene and Mike watch them reach the entrance to
the parking lot. THEY TURN IN.

MIKE
Let's go.

Darlene, FROZEN.

MIKE (CONT'D)
Now, Darlene.

The car pulls to a halt behind the Corvair. In an off-line
position, like a COP.

Mike, reaching over to start the engine when - A SPOTLIGHT
from inside the other car hits the Corvair.

The door opens and THE COP inside gets out. Walks up to the
car. Flashlight outstretched, shining it in Mike and
Darlene's faces, blinding them. He reaches Mike's door.

MIKE (CONT'D)
Get your I.D.
(rolls down his
window)
Man, you kinda creeped us-—

THUNK! Mike's BLOOD AND TEETH EXPLODE onto the dashboard.
The muzzle of a SILENCER FLASHES. The Man KEEPS SHOOTING.
BULLETS PUNCH through flesh and bone. Some shots rip straight
through Mike and into Darlene.

Mike is shot in the face, the neck, and the arm. Darlene is
shot twice in each arm, and three times in the back.

The Man lowers the gun. Silence.

The Man turns away. Walking back to his car. A GROAN. The
Man turns. Walks back to the Corvair, reloading. Mike.
Still alive.

The Man FIRES TWO MORE SHOTS into Mike, propelling him into
the BACK SEAT. Then TWO MORE into Darlene for good measure.
The Man turns and walks away.

FADE TO:

EXT. BLUE ROCK SPRINGS -- PARKING LOT -- LATER 5A

P.O.V. the front of a police motorcycle as it's HEADLIGHT
cuts into the lot... OVER THIS WE HEAR a coin clink into a
phone. One number dialed.

FEMALE OPERATOR {NANCY SLOVER}
Vallejo Police Department?

The headlight, SWINGING over asphalt until it comes to rest
on MIKE, slumped against the REAR of the Corvair. Blood,
running down his shirt...

A MAN (0.S.)
I want to a report a double
murder...

The Officer (HOFFMAN) dismounts and runs to him...

A MAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
If you go one mile east on
Columbus Parkway to the public
park, you will find kids ina
brown car...

Mike gestures - and Hoffman goes to the front seat to find
Darlene. In even worse shape. She tries to mouth something.

A MAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
They were shot with a nine
millimeter Luger. I also killed
those kids last year. Goodbye.

CLICK. The line goes dead. SMASH TO OUR TITLE SCREEN...
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO SKYLINE -- MORNING 6
August 1, 1969. SOARING OVER WATER towards the Bay City.
Magnificent spires and bridges. Bustling to life.
INT. GRAYSMITH APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- MORNING 7
ROBERT GRAYSMITH stands, brushing his teeth. Mid 20's. Next
to him, his 4 year old son DAVID brushes his teeth as well.
Mimicking his father's movements. Graysmith does his top
teeth, David does his. Graysmith smiles. David smiles.
Graysmith scrubs his tongue, David scrubs his.
GRAYSMITH
And spit.

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 6.
CONTINUED:

Graysmith spits. David does not.

DAVID
I swallowed it.
GRAYSMITH
Why?
DAVID

It was minty.

Graysmith laughs and scoops David up.

INT. LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

The tiny apartment is cluttered. Dick Tracy and old mystery
movie posters abound. The TV PLAYS while Graysmith ties
David's shoes.

NEWSCASTER
+..at the Hall of Justice vow that
the rapist will be arrested and
brought to trial...

Graysmith frowns and shuts off the TV.

DAVID
__, (giggling)
Rapist! Rapist!

GRAYSMITH
Do daddy a favor and don't yell
that at preschool, okay?

DAVID
Rapist!
GRAYSMITH
Much better.
He finishes David's shoes.
DAVID
Are we gonna see Mom and Aaron

tonight?
Graysmith winces a little. Glances at the clock.

GRAYSMITH
We're gonna be late.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 7.

9 EXT. PRESCHOOL -- MORNING 9

Graysmith kisses his son on the forehead and sends him
inside. Then turns and RUNS...

10 INT. GRAYSMITH'S CAR - INCHING ALONG IN TRAFFIC - DAY 10
Traffic's bad. Graysmith sketching something in his lap as
he inches along. We get a good look - FOUR CARTOON SKETCHES.
Very rough, but good...
11 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS -- MORNING 11
Graysmith hustles down the sidewalk amongst pedestrians.
Behind him, a MAIL TRUCK passes him on the street Both,
coming up to the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, a grand old
building on Fifth and Mission. The logo above the entrance.
Graysmith pushes through the doors into

Graysmith hurries across the lobby towards and OPEN ELEVATOR.
The DOORS CLOSE just before he can reach it...

The TRUCK halts by a LOADING DOCK. TWO MEN get out and begin
unloading large DUFFEL BAGS of mail onto a FLATBED DOLLY...

14 INT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE THIRD FLOOR -- MORNING 14
DING! Graysmith emerges from the elevator into the
controlled chaos of the paper's editorial offices. Phones
ring. Typewriters clack. Reporters hustle. Graysmith heads
to a small COFFEE STAND manned by an ill tempered white
haired midget named SHORTY.

GRAYSMITH
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

Shorty points upward at his sign - "DELICIOUS AS HELL COFFEE
AND SANDWICHES".

14A INT. ELEVATOR -- MORNING 14A

The Mailmen ride up towards the third floor with a smaller

INT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE THIRD FLOOR -- MORNING 14B

Graysmith gets his coffee from Shorty and heads to his desk,
getting hung up by a CROWD OF PEOPLE standing around -—

PAUL AVERY'S DESK. Avery, 30's, well dressed, crime
reporter. Currently entertaining the crowd with a joke.

AVERY
...and the bartender says,
“Superman, you are one mean son of
a bitch when you're drunk!"

The others laugh. Graysmith pushes through them. Reaching
his own desk. Devoid of people, away from the action. He
opens his briefcase, just settling in when

HYMAN
Editorial in two!

Graysmith begins regathering up his things as -

The ELEVATOR doors across the room open and the MAILMEN

emerge. We pick them up again, traveling the length of the

Third Floor offices and into

INT. CAROL FISHER'S OFFICE -- MORNING 16

Where the cart is DUMPED OUT onto a CAROL FISHER'S desk. We
stay on the LETTER PILE as the she begins to sort them.

We zoom in on follow ONE LETTER in particular. Rush to
Editor is chickenscrawled twice on it. Through the door, we
see GRAYSMITH - last through into the EDITORIAL ROOM.

PECK (0.S.)
All right let's get going.

Graysmith shuts the door. Carol begins opening the letters.

INT. EDITORIAL ROOM -- MORNING 17

TEMPLETON PECK, privileged and ascoted runs the Editorial
Meeting around a long oak table. As he goes through
Graysmith's sketches one by one:

PECK
Horrid, horrid, not horrid, and

Carol slices open the Rush To Editor letter...

INT. EDITORIAL ROOM -- MORNING 17B

PECK
Paul, what's on the crime beat?

AVERY
Janice in Datebook won't let me
take her to dinner.
(off Peck's look)
What? It's a crime.

Graysmith cracks the slightest of smiles. Interrupted as the
door opens revealing Carol Fisher. Face grave.

PECK
Carol, what do you-

CAROL FISHER
You need to see this.

She lays the Rush to Editor letter on the table. The others
crowd around. Scanning it. Peck looks up to Carol.

PECK
Go get the publisher.

CUT TO:
INT. EDITORIAL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 18

CHARLES DE YOUNG THEIRIOT - sits at the head of the table.
Old, patrician, reading the letter aloud.

THEIRIOT
Dear Editor. This is the murderer
of the two teenagers last
Christmas at Lake Herman and the
girl on the 4th of July near the
golf course in Vallejo. To prove
I killed them, I shall state some
facts which only I and the police
know. Christmas - Brand name of
ammo Super X. Ten shots were
fired. The boy was on his back
with his feet to the car. The
girl.

 

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 10.
18 CONTINUED: 18

He hands the letter to Peck with distaste. Motioning for him
to continue.

PECK

The girl was on her right side,
feet to the west. July 4th - One
girl was wearing patterned slacks.
The boy was also shot in the knee.
Brand name of ammo was Western.
Here is part of a cipher. The
other two parts of the cipher are
being mailed to the editors of the
Vallejo Times and S.F. Examiner.

NEXT PAGE - Full of strange symbols. A CODE.

PECK (CONT'D)
I want you to print this cipher on
the front page of your paper. In
this cipher is my identity. If
you do not print this cipher by
the afternoon of Fry. The Ist of
August 69, I will go on a kill
rampage Fry night. I will cruise
around all weekend killing lone
people in the night then move on
to kill again until I end up with
a dozen people over the weekend".
(pause)
It's unsigned except for a symbol.

Peck puts the letter down. The others move forward to
examine it. Seeing the SYMBOL:

AVERY
Is it me, or does that look like a
gunsight?

Lost among them, Graysmith picks up THE CODE. WEIRD SYMBOLS
litter the page in UNBROKEN BLOCK PARAGRAPHS...

THEIRIOT
Today is August first. He wants his
code in the afternoon edition.

HYMAN
If the Examiner doesn't have the
balls to run it, we scoop the Bay-

PECK

Charles, this man is talking about
shooting twelve people-

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT ll.
CONTINUED: (2) 18

HYMAN
And not running this could make
him do that-

PECK
If we run it we could be setting a
very dangerous precedent-

HYMAN
Oh, come on, it's newsworthy-

PECK
We'd be giving this sick bastard a
soapbox. What does that say to

people?
THEIRIOT
Back up. The Vallejo stuff, is it
true?
HYMAN
Paul?
AVERY

What, I cover crime in Vallejo?
(off Theiriot's look)
I cover crime in Vallejo.

He rises and exits to make calls. Hyman, to Theiriot:
HYMAN
Let's shoot the code and call
SFPD. If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.
A beat. Theiriot nods.

HYMAN (CONT'D)
Copy!

A COPY BOY sticks his head in.
HYMAN (CONT'D)
Get Grant in here, we need some
photos. Graysmith?
Graysmith looks up from the code, his reverie broken.
HYMAN (CONT'D)
Don't you have a cartoon to

finish?

Graysmith takes the hint. Puts down the code and leaves.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 12.

19 INT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE THIRD FLOOR -- MORNING 19

Graysmith, wandering back to his desk. Passing Avery who
sits, dialing. Graysmith, hoping to hear the conversation...

AVERY

This is Paul Avery from the San
Francisco Chronicle, I'm looking
for someone to shed some light on
a letter we received...

20 INT. VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- MORNING 20
SERGEANT JACK MULANAX (40's hook-nosed), on the phone.

MULANAX
You want to run it, run it-

MULANAX
Lenny, hang on...
(clicks over)
Sergeant Mulanax.

21 INT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE THIRD FLOOR -- MORNING 21

AVERY
Sergeant, this is Paul Avery at
the Chronicle. I just wanted to
check if you had an unsolved
firearm related homicide on
Christmas and maybe one on July
4th?

MULANAX
(through phone)
Shit, you got one too?

DOA, David Farraday and Betty Jensen
- July 4th, Darlene Ferrin and
Michael

(trying to pronounce)
Mah- Mag- I think it's "Mayhew"
He lived. She didn't.

THEIRIOT
The murder weapons?

AVERY
Match the calibers he gives in the
letter. I bet the Times Herald
will go with it.

Hyman cups his hand over the receiver to update them:

HYMAN
Examiner says they're going but
won't go front page. I say we go
front page and if he kills twelve
people, it's not our fault.

Theiriot heaves a long sigh as the debate continues...

INT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE THIRD FLOOR -- LATER 23

Graysmith, at his desk. Unfinished cartoon pushed aside. He
doodles something else - THE CODE. Recreated from memory.

He looks up to see the ENTIRE EDITORIAL STAFF of the paper is
now in with Theiriot. Carol Fisher stops by his desk.

CAROL FISHER
Robert, we need- You're not done
yet?

GRAYSMITH
Sorry.

He switches to the cartoon.

GRAYSMITH (CONT'D)
Theiriot's still here.

CAROL FISHER
He's never here this late...

Theiriot, quiet. Thinking. Graysmith hovers with his
cartoon near Peck who whispers:

PECK
Leave it.
THEIRIOT
(deciding)

Okay, replate, we'll go page 4.

Weary, but happy a decision has been made, the staff heads
for the exit. Avery, commenting to the others:

AVERY
Twenty bucks to the first person
who cracks the guy's name.

GRAYSMITH
(quietly)
He won't give his name.

Avery turns, surprised the quiet cartoonist has spoken.
Graysmith looks a little surprised too.

AVERY
(to everybody)
Anyone wanna grab a drink?

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET -- EVENING 25
Graysmith heads home. Passing "MORTI'S", a BAR near the

CHRONICLE. Looking through the window - Avery and several

others from the paper laughing, carousing. He watches for a
moment, then moves on.

INT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE -- EVENING 26

THE CODE - Sitting on a white table, CAMERA mounted above.
CHOOM! CHOOM! Flashbulbs go off. Being shot for print.

INT. GRAYSMITH'S APARTMENT -- EVENING 27

Graysmith dumps a stack of LIBRARY BOOKS on his desk. David
grabs the top one happily - Yertle the Turtle. All the
others, about CODEBREAKING or MURDER. Graysmith looks at
the wall - covered with reproductions of JAMES BOND NOVEL
COVERS. He sighs. Begins taking some down. We can't see
his hands. He moves away and we see he's tacked THE CIPHER
up in their place. As we push in on SYMBOLS...

NAVY PROJECT LEADER
All right, people, listen up...

INT. NAVAL BASE -- SAN DIEGO -- NIGHT 28
SUPERIMPOSE - U.S. NAVAL INTELLIGENCE - CRYPTOGRAPHY

A group of CRYPTOGRAPHERS seated around a table with the
cipher. The PROJECT LEADER addresses them.

NAVY PROJECT LEADER
The cipher is broken into three
sections - each one is eight lines
with seventeen symbols...

INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING -- WASHINGTON D.C. -- NIGHT 29
SUPERIMPOSE - U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE - CODE INTEL
A similar gathering of codebreakers.

D.O.D. PROJECT LEADER
No breaks between the symbols
denoting different words, no

DONALD and BETTYE HARDEN sit perusing their morning papers.
Donald examines the PRINTED CODE. He studies it. A beat.

DONALD
Hey, take a gander at this code
thingy.

He passes it to his wife. She looks intrigued.

DONALD (CONT'D)
Want to give it a go?

INT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE THIRD FLOOR -- DAY 32
August 7, 1969. Graysmith, working on the day's cartoon.

AVERY (0.S.)
The guy who used to sit there was
a great cartoonist.

Graysmith looks up to see Avery.

AVERY (CONT'D)
Bob Bastion. Now he's on public
television for some reason...
Paul Avery.

GRAYSMITH
Robert Graysmith. I've been here
nine months.

AVERY
You were right, by the way. He
didn't give his name.

That gets Graysmith's attention.

GRAYSMITH
Who cracked it?

AVERY
A history teacher and his wife in
Salinas.

He lays the translation of the code down on the desk.

Graysmith picks it up. Begins reading aloud, the horror
growing on his face with every sentence.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 17.

GRAYSMITH
I like killing people because it
is so much fun. It is more fun
than killing wild game in the
forest because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.
Something gives me the most
thrilling experience, it is even
better than getting your rocks off
with a girl. The best part of it
is that when I die I will be
reborn in paradise and they - They
I have killed will become my
slaves. I will not give you my
name because you will try to slow
down or stop my collecting of
slaves for the afterlife.

Silence. Graysmith, shaken.

AVERY
Methinks our friend is a tad bit
fuckered in the head. I heard he
even sent Vallejo a code key to
help. Impatient prick, isn't he?

GRAYSMITH
What are those letters at the
bottom?

He points and we see them - EBEORIETMETHHPITI

AVERY
Leftovers? Maybe an anagram?

Graysmith begins writing, trying different permutations of
the letters: Robert Hemphill, Van M. Blackman, Robert Emmet
the Hippie...

AVERY (CONT'D)
You're pretty good at those.
(noticing)
"Robert Emmet the Hippie"?

Graysmith tries more. Avery watches. After a bit:

How'd you know he wasn't gonna
give his name?

Avery walks away, intrigued. Passing Peck, who whispers:

PECK
Paul, editorial now.
INT. EDITORIAL CONFERENCE ROOM -- MORNING 33

The EDITORIAL STAFF huddled, going through something. Avery
pushes through them. Bumping into Hyman.

HYMAN
Another letter, more of the same -—
details about the murders. He
taped a flashlight to the gun,
that's how he hit them in the dark-

THEIRIOT
But he gave himself a name.

Avery looks down as we push in on the NEW LETTER:

DEAR EDITOR,
THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKING...

CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST ROAD -- AFTERNOON 34
VROOM! A VOLKSWAGEN KARMANN GHIA ROARS past camera, speeding
down a winding road carved out of the forest above LAKE
BERRYESSA. Two college kids, BRYAN HARTNELL at the wheel,
CECELIA SHEPHARD next to him. Young. Pretty. Smitten.

September 27, 1969 - Napa County, California

EXT. LAKE BERRYESSA -- TWILIGHT 35

BRYAN
This used to be a town. The
county decided the land would work
better as a lake, so they flooded
it. There's an entire-

were here last spring, remember?

He smiles. She smiles back but then SEES SOMETHING.

CECELIA (CONT'D)
Somebody else is here.

Bryan stays in his position. Not looking.

BRYAN
It's a public park.

CECELIA
He's watching us.

BRYAN
Well, we're very good looking.

Cecelia playfully swats him. Looking back to the brush.

CECELIA
Where'd he go?

She scans the landscape.

CECELIA (CONT'D)
There. He went behind a tree.

BRYAN
(still not looking)
So? He's taking a leak.

A beat.

CECELIA
Oh, my God, he's got a gun!

Bryan turning to see - The TREE only TWENTY FEET AWAY. A
MAN IN BLACK has emerged from behind it. Wearing A HOOD like
an EXECUTIONER'S MASK. Slits for eyeholes and over them,
sunglasses. The hood's front with a CROSS STITCHED into it
which QUARTERS A CIRCLE. A SHEATHED KNIFE hangs from his
left side and a GUN IN HAND. Bryan and Cecelia, beginning to
stand... The Man walks over, aiming the weapon at them.

Don't move, I want your money and

BRYAN
Whatever you say. We'll
cooperate, okay? What do you want
us to do?

The Man motions for them to stand. They do. Bryan is
"water side" standing parallel to the man. Cecelia is to
Bryan's right. The Man keeps his distance. Bryan pulls out
the his wallet and tosses it. Searching his pockets for the
keys, motor-mouthing:

BRYAN (CONT'D)
You're welcome to everything I
have, but is there something more
I could do? Could I give you a
check or something?

THE MAN
No.

BRYAN
I could give you my phone number,
and, you know- maybe I could give
you more help than you think you
need-

CECELIA
(explaining)
He's a sociology major.

THE MAN
Sorry, I can't remember where I
put the keys, they might be on the
blanket, can I-

The Man motions with the gun - Bryan leans down to search on
their blanket.

BRYAN
Can I ask you a question? I read
in Reader's Digest that thieves
don't always have their guns
loaded-

THE MAN
It's loaded.

He pulls some lengths of hollow core clothesline from behind
his back. Hands them to Cecelia who immediately goes behind
Bryan and begins tying his hands behind his back, loosely.
Bryan, to Cecelia as she works:

BRYAN (CONT'D)
(whispering)
I might be able to get the gun-

CECELIA
Bryan!

The Man points the gun at his head.

THE MAN
Don't get any ideas-
BRYAN
I won't-
THE MAN

I killed a guard escaping from
prison in Montana.

BRYAN
I'm not doing anything, okay?
THE MAN
I'm not afraid to kill again.
BRYAN
(after a bit; as she

ties)
What was the name of that prison?

The Man doesn't respond. They stand in silence as Cecelia
finishes. The Man immediately goes to her and begins binding
her hands behind her back (he may have holstered the gun to
do this).

BRYAN (CONT'D)
You said it was in Montana, right?

THE MAN
I'm taking your car and going to
Mexico.

The Man finishes with Cecelia and steps behind Bryan.

THE MAN (CONT'D)
She tied you loose, didn't she?

He CRANKS the ropes around Bryan's wrists tighter.

THE MAN (CONT'D)
Get on your stomach so I can tie
your feet.

BRYAN
Come on, man. I didn't complain
when you tied our hands-

THE MAN
On your stomach-

BRYAN
It gets cold at night, we could
freeze-

The Man steps points the gun at him at point blank range:

THE MAN
Get down! Right now!

Bryan and Cecelia do. The Man binds Bryan's feet to his
hands in silence. Does the same to Cecelia. Hog-tying them.
Then steps back, surveying his handiwork.

BRYAN
Now that it's all said and done -
was the gun really loaded?

The Man pops the clip. Removes a SHINY BULLET. Showing
Bryan. Then puts it away. Moving behind him, out of his
line of vision. Bryan, lying there, trying to figure out how
he's going to get himself untied once the Man leaves when-

The Man pulls the KNIFE from the scabbard and STABS BRYAN IN

THE BACK. It happens so quick, it takes a moment for Cecelia
to realize what's happening. And then she begins to SCREAM.

The Man pulls the knife out of Bryan. RAISES IT AGAIN...

And Dear God, we're actually going to have to watch this...

Blood flowing. On Cecelia. Screaming. Crimson flecks on
her face. Bryan's face, in a daze. Jarred forcibly every
time the Man stabs down. He does it six times, then lurches
off him. He turns and STABS CECELIA. She tries to roll. He
just keeps stabbing. Her side. Her front.

Bryan's eyes. Finding Cecelia. Seeing what's happening to
her. And then looking away...

CUT TO:
EXT. LAKE BERRYESSA -- EVENING 36

Later. The screaming is done. The sun, almost down.
Cecelia has rolled to her side. Her bound wrists now up by
Bryan's mouth and he's trying to CHEW THEM FREE. He spits
out some rope. Pulling at the knot with his teeth between
sobs... Her hand comes free. She moves... and SCREAMS. We
can't hear it, because OVER THIS WE HEAR - More coins in a
pay phone. Dialing. Ringing...

NAPA POLICEMAN
Napa Police Department?

Bryan rolls. Positioning his wrists by Cecelia's free hand.

THE MAN
I want to report a murder - no, a
double murder.

With an incredible effort she begins tugging on his ropes...

THE MAN (CONT'D)
They are two miles north of Park
Headquarters. They were in a
white Volkswagen Kharmann Ghia.

Bryan's wrists come free...

THE MAN (CONT'D)
I'm the one that did it.

CLICK. He's hung up. Bryan, pulling the ropes from his
legs. He crawls to Cecelia. Kisses her once on the lips.

BRYAN
I'll get someone...

Somehow, he manages to STAND. Stooped over, arms crossed
around his stomach. Just one step is an amazing effort.
Bryan takes three before COLLAPSING. He only made it six
feet. He rises again. Walks again. Falls again. Finally
he gives up... And begins to crawl.

Pulling back to reveal it's a sketch of ZODIAC IN COSTUME.

What's he doing out of Vallejo?
And- Sweet Christmas, what are you

By now we can tell we're by Graysmith's desk.

He stops, his EYES GOING WIDE as something clicks.
GRAYSMITH (CONT'D)

AVERY
Horrible.

Aaand he's back.

As Graysmith returns to the desk clutching a FILM BOOK. He
puts it down, frantically paging through it. He turns the
book to Avery and Hyman and stabs the page: A black and
white FILM STILL from an old movie - a man DRESSED
IDENTICALLY AS THE ZODIAC.

HYMAN
What is that?

GRAYSMITH
A still from The Most Dangerous
Game.

AVERY
"The Most Dangerous Game"?

GRAYSMITH
It's a movie about a count who
hunts people for sport. "Man is
the most dangerous animal of all"
I knew I'd heard it somewhere!

AVERY
And this is the Count?

GRAYSMITH
Exactly. "Count Zaroff".

AVERY
"Zaroff" with a 2?

RADIO HOST (V.O.)
...news on the Twenty. Because of
the recent attacks police have
ordered curfews in effect tonight
for the following counties - Napa,
Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda,
Marin, and San Mateo so please
everyone, stay safe, stay inside,
and keep calling.

Pushing down into the bustling streets of the city - people
way too busy with their urban lives to be bothered with
anything else.

RADIO HOST (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Vic in San Francisco, you're on

the line. So the Zodiac doesn't

scare you?

CALLER 1 (V.0.)
Heck no, the guy's just doing his
thing out in the sticks. What's
really scary is the yippies down
in the Haight with their "free
love".

4l EXT. MASON AND GEARY -- NIGHT 4l

Heavy foot traffic. The THEATER CROWD just being let out. A
couple hippies play guitar for change.

RADIO HOST (V.O.)
Alfred from Vacaville feels
differently - Alfred, are you
gonna take that?

CALLER 2 (V.O.)
Well, I agree about the hippies,
but I resent him calling us "the

We have good solid Christian

We track the Cab's progress, moving from the business and
theater district towards the residential PACIFIC HEIGHTS...

RADIO HOST (V.O.)
You bring up a good question - is
the Zodiac a Satanist? Amber from
Oakland, what do you think?

CALLER 3 (V.O.)
Well, the symbols look Satanic,
but that's not what I called about
- my question is where does the
Chronicle get off encouraging him
like that?

RADIO HOST (V.O.)

A great question, and I'd also ask
- since when did a big city paper
like the Chronicle even care about
what happens in rural communities
like Vallejo? Aren't they
covering this just to sell more
papers? Alison in San Francisco?

CALLER 4 (V.O.)
I don't know about them caring or
not caring but I do know The
Zodiac demanded they print his
letters or he'd kill more people-

CALLER 3 (V.O.)
(breaking in)
But they didn't have to. And he's
killed more people anyway.

EXT. PACIFIC HEIGHTS -- NIGHT 43

The cab slowing. A posh part of the city. The sidewalks,
empty. Pulling to halt at the corner of Washington and
Cherry. The Cabbie puts it in park...

RADIO HOST
A great point Amber. So a general
question for all our callers, what
do you think he'll do next?

BOOM! The Cabbie's HEAD SNAPS FORWARD. Shot by his

PASSENGER, who we don't see. Silence. As we begin to pull

...it's a TOMMY-GUN. Coming from an old tape recorder.
Graysmith lays on the bed next to his son in the dark,
listening to a DICK TRACY radio program on cassette:

FLAT-TOP (0.S.)
Take that Tracy! Come on boys,
let's go!

The sound of squealing tires. Then pistol shots.
FLAT-TOP (0.S.) (CONT'D)
He shot our tires! Darn that

The sound of a car crashing. David giggles. Graysmith,
who's heard this a thousand times, mouths the next lines:

CHOOM! KLIEG LIGHTS on a Fire Department "Spotlight Vehicle"
snap on, illuminating the block. An AMBULANCE and CRIME LAB
VAN are already on scene. Uniforms work through the crowd,
comparing faces to a physical description they've gotten.

Toschi pulls to a halt at the edge of the scene and gets out
with Armstrong. Homicide INSPECTOR WALTER KRACKE approaches.

KRACKE
Evening, gents. Lovely night for
a botched robbery, huh?

TOSCHI
Third one this week. The end of
summer rush.

KRACKE

I got foot patrols going through
the park and the dogs are on their
way. Victim's name is Paul Stine.

Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

Toschi, noticing the crowd of onlookers and other cops
lingering near the body and the car.

ARMSTRONG
Any witnesses?

KRACKE
Kids who called it in saw the
suspect from that window.

He points to a THREE STORY HOUSE across the street.

ARMSTRONG
They hear a shot?

KRACKE
No, they first saw him in the
front seat, thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver. Oldest
kid ran downstairs to get a better
look from that window, described
him as a white male, glasses,
crewcut, stocky and wearing a dark
jacket.

TOSCHI
I thought he was black.

ARMSTRONG
That's the description that went
out to radio cars.

KRACKE

TOSCHI

Body.

The partners split up. A well practiced ritual. Toschi goes
to the cab where LAB TECHS are photographing the DRIVER, who
lies in the bloody front seat. One tech, DAGITZ looks up as
Toschi approaches.

DAGITZ
Dave. Looks like he wiped the cab
down pretty good but we've got
some blood over here.

He points to the door jamb. Toschi pulls out a flashlight to
examine it. Squinting:

TOSCHI
Print?

DAGITZ
Could very well be. We'll dust it
at the Hall. Odd thing is, we
also got gloves.

TOSCHI
The suspect's?

DAGITZ
There's blood on them.

Toschi flips open his notebook and begins to SKETCH the
scene. He works quickly, using a TAPE MEASURE to gauge
distances. When he's done:

Toschi leans in to check the cab's floor. Discovering:

TOSCHI (CONT'D)
Got a casing. Single. Nine mil.

The Photographer leans in. Flashbulbs pop. Documenting the
position of the shiny copper casing. Toschi measures its
position. Adds it to the sketch.

TOSCHI (CONT'D)
Tweezers?

Dagitz hands him tweezers. Toschi gingerly bags the casing.
Straightens up, as Armstrong approaches.

ARMSTRONG
Nothing from the crowd.

TOSCHI
Okay - I'm your shooter, an Adult
Negro Male who happens to be a
stocky Caucasian. I flag a cab, I
give this address- Did he give
this address? Who's got the fare
book?

A UNIFORM produces the bagged book. Armstrong checks it.

ARMSTRONG
Says Washington and Maple. One
block that way.

He points. Toschi jogs down the street a little towards the
other corner. Sees what he needs to and jogs back.

TOSCHI
Lighting's the same there so maybe
I see somebody walking their dog.

ARMSTRONG
You don't want a witness so you
say "go down a block". Cabbie
pulls over-

TOSCHI
And I wait till he puts it in park
cause I'm smart and I don't want
him hitting the accelerator after
I shoot him.

TOSCHI
Either way, I just dumped a quart
of blood into the front seat.

ARMSTRONG
So why do you get into the front
seat?

TOSCHI
The money?

ARMSTRONG

But he's dead. You could just
reach over the seat, pull his
wallet and never get near all the
blood. Why do you get into the
front seat?

TOSCHI
Cause I'm an idiot?

ARMSTRONG
You're not an idiot, you waited
for him to put it in park.

TOSCHI
Let me see the fare book...

Armstrong hands it over. Toschi peruses it.

TOSCHI

It'll screw us.
ARMSTRONG

We're already screwed. We just
went from routine cabbie shooting
to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids".

Silence. Toschi sighs. The door to Morrill's office opens
and he steps out with a grave look on his face...

ANCHORMAN
The Zodiac Killer has come to San

which takes credit for the murder

Ending on Toschi, hanging up his phone. Behind him CAPTAIN
MARTIN LEE pulls on a tie and straightens it.

CAPTAIN LEE
Press conference is at four, I
need to tell them where we are.

Toschi's phone begins RINGING AGAIN. He ignores it.

TOSCHI
We're coordinating with the school
board, and expect a break in the

CAPTAIN LEE
Where are we really?

TOSCHI
Swamped. When they can't get

TOSCHI
How many men can you give me?

Can't help you.

ARMSTRONG
Ken, I don't want to get into a

Wing Walkers - they're a type of
boot specifically designed to walk
on the wings of planes,
exclusively sold at military PX's.

Armstrong, writing this down...

ARMSTRONG
You can only buy at a PX with a
military I.D, so our suspect could
be military. Did you narrow your
list off this?

NARLOW
Yeah.

ARMSTRONG
Did Vallejo?

NARLOW

I don't know. I don't work in
Vallejo, I work here.

ARMSTRONG
Can you send us a photo of the
bootprint?

NARLOW

Yes, can you send us the

ARMSTRONG
I though Questioned Documents
already did.

NARLOW
Nope. Vallejo's got it, we don't.

We don't have a fax.

ARMSTRONG
Look- I just want to get us

MULANAX
Have you called Solano Sheriff's

ARMSTRONG

Why would I call Solano?

MULANAX
Cause the two kids who got killed
last Christmas were Solano's.

They were over the county line.
You're gonna need to coordinate

You need to sit down with a sketch

Neither of the Patrolmen can look at him. Toschi, realizing,
this is a nightmare for them, too.

GRAYSMITH
Why not?

Avery stares at him. He's not going away. Avery sighs and
motions for Graysmith to sit.

INT. MORTI'S -- NIGHT 105
Graysmith sits with Avery. Finally allowed in to the inner

circle. On the table - whiskey for Avery and a HUGE BLUE
UMBRELLA DRINK for Graysmith. As he sips it:

AVERY
So, tell me about yourself. You
married?

GRAYSMITH

Divorced. Two kids.

AVERY
What do you do for fun?

AVERY (CONT'D)

Why have you been going through my
trash?

Graysmith doesn't respond. Looking guilty.
AVERY (CONT'D)

How'd you know he was going to
send another code?

GRAYSMITH
I guessed.

AVERY
You guessed.

GRAYSMITH

The first code was too easy.

AVERY
This can no longer be ignored -
what is this you're drinking?

GRAYSMITH
You wouldn't make fun of my drink
if you tried it.

Avery, breaking. He takes the drink. Takes a sip and...

CUT TO:

GRAYSMITH AND AVERY - Later. Now both have huge blue
drinks. Both buzzed now, the new code in front of them. He
removes a vial of coke from his coat. Taps some into a dish.
Rolling the tip of an unlit cigarette in it.

GRAYSMITH (CONT'D)
Who actually cracked the code?

A married couple who like puzzles.
So what does that say about
Zodiac?

AVERY
He's no expert.

GRAYSMITH
Right. The first one was just a
substitution code like the kind we
all did as Boy Scouts, A is 1, B
is 2, and so on-

AVERY
We weren't all Boy Scouts.

Graysmith pulls a rumpled copy of the FIRST CIPHER from his
pocket and spreads it out on the table.

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 66.
105 CONTINUED: (3) 105

GRAYSMITH
It looks hard, but you just have to
know where to start-

AVERY
You actually carry that around
with you?

GRAYSMITH
Why?
AVERY
(smiling)
No reason.
GRAYSMITH

What is the most common double
consonant in the English language?

AVERY
Consonant?

GRAYSMITH
The double L. And what's the one
word we know Zodiac will use in
here?

AVERY
"Kill".

GRAYSMITH
Exactly, so the Hardens start
looking for double symbols which
they find here, here, and here -
each with the same two symbols
preceding them. Now they've got a
repeating four letter word ending
with two symbols they assume stand
for "L"-

AVERY
(getting into it)
And since they think the whole
word is "Kill"-

GRAYSMITH
That gives them the symbols for
"K" and "I". And they're on their
way.

AVERY

So how does someone go from A is 1
and B is 2 to this?

GRAYSMITH
The same way I did. He goes to
the library.

Graysmith opens his briefcase and pulls out a STACK of
LIBRARY BOOKS. Holds up the first one.

GRAYSMITH (CONT'D)
"The Codebreakers". In the
preface, the author presents a
simple substitution alphabet. 8
of the 26 symbols he suggests were
in the first Zodiac cipher.

AVERY
What about other symbols? The
medieval looking ones?

GRAYSMITH
I thought they looked medieval
too. Then I found a cipher used
during the Middle Ages in here.
(pulls a second book)
Guess what the cipher was called.
The Zodiac Alphabet.

A beat. Avery takes the book. Looks at the page. The
Zodiac Alphabet sits there, many symbols identical to the
First Code. Avery, lights the cigarette. Taking Graysmith
in.

AVERY
Jesus, kid... What do you want
out of this?

GRAYSMITH

What? Nothing-

AVERY
What's your angle? This is good
business for everyone but you.

GRAYSMITH
How can you call this business?

INT. TOSCHI'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 106

Toschi, up late. Staring at the letter. Big band plays on
the phonograph. He absently munches animal crackers as he
rereads the lines over again:

What you do not know is whether the death
machine is at the sight or whether it is
being stored in my basement for future use

He looks up at her. A beat.

TOSCHI
I have to make a call.

He picks up the phone and dials. She heads for the bedroom.
On the other end, groggy:

ARMSTRONG (0.S.)

Hello?

TOSCHI
Not many people have basements in
California-

ARMSTRONG (0.S.)
“Basement for future use", yeah.
I'll have Vallejo and Napa check
with their city planners. Get
some sleep.

Toschi looks to the bedroom. Then back to the letter. No
chance of that tonight.

EXT. MELVIN BELLI'S TOWNHOUSE -- NIGHT 107

December 29, 1969. Bleary eyed, Toschi and Armstrong climb
the steps to Belli's richly appointed residence.

BELLI (V.O.)
(overly dramatic)
Dear Melvin, this... Is the

Zodiac speaking.
INT. MELVIN BELLI'S TOWNHOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 108

Close on Toschi and Armstrong, pad out, taking notes. Belli
across from them, reading the newest ZODIAC LETTER.

BELLI
I wish you a happy Christmass.
The one thing I ask of you is
this, please help me. I cannot
reach out for help because this
thing in me won't let me.

WIDEN to show that Belli has called the police there in the
middle of a DINNER PARTY. The hoi palloi of San Francisco
stand behind Toschi and Armstrong, gasping at Belli's
dramatic reading of the letter he just received.

Belli pauses as his HOUSEKEEPER delivers a hot toddy.

BELLI (CONT'D)
Thank you.

(clears his throat)
I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check I am afraid I
will loose control again and take
my ninth & possibly tenth victim

SOCIETY WOMAN
Melvin, he's reaching out to you!

ARMSTRONG
Poor fellow.

BELLI
Inspectors, he sent the letter
directly to my residence instead
of the papers. It's a cry for
help, intended as a private
communique.

TOSCHI
Which is why you contacted the
press.

BELLI
The people have a right to know.
(offering)
Toddy?

ARMSTRONG
When did the letter arrive?

BELLI
In the last week. I was away for
the holiday, on safari. What did
you gentlemen do for Christmas?

TOSCHI
You're looking at it.

BELLI
You must see Africa. The cradle
of civilization. Fascinating
people. Beautiful. Savages.
Murmurs of agreement from the partygoers.

ARMSTRONG
Back to the killer who wrote you?

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 70.
108 CONTINUED: (2) 108

BELLI
Yes, of course. It's my belief he
only penned this letter because he
couldn't get through to me on the
Dunbar show or here.

TOSCHI
He called here?

BELLI
Several times. I was out, but he
spoke with my housekeeper. Didn't
leave a number.

ARMSTRONG
He's crafty like that. Mind if I
ask her some questions?

BELLI
Not at all, though the real story
is the letter.

ARMSTRONG
I'll be back.

He exits to go look for the housekeeper. Belli, focusing his
attention on Toschi.

BELLI
This is a window into this man's
soul. Killing is his compulsion -
though he tries to ignore it, it
drives him. It's in his blood.

TOSCHI
Could be. Or maybe he just likes
attention.
109 EXT. HIGHWAY 132 -- NIGHT 109

March 22, 1970. Outside Modesto. Late. A lone duster of a
SEDAN rattles down the highway, the only car in sight.

110 INT. SEDAN (MOVING) -- NIGHT 110

KATHLEEN JOHNS at the wheel. Sweet face, 30's. Changes
lanes. From nowhere, HEADLIGHTS are suddenly behind her.
Kathleen signals. Changing lanes so the HEADLIGHTS can pass.
They don't. They pull up behind her. FLASHING NOW.
Kathleen keeps driving. The other driver becomes more
insistent. HONKING. Motioning for her to pull over.
Finally she does. Pulling to a halt on the SHOULDER of the
road. The other car pulls in behind her.

(CONTINUED)
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 71.

And as it does, we TILT to see... Kathleen's SLEEPING BABY on
the seat next to her. A MAN walks up. WE DON'T SEE HIS
FACE. Kathleen, nervous. Thinking maybe this wasn't the
best idea. She reaches to put the car back in gear when:

THE MAN (0.S.)
(apologetic)

I hope I didn't scare you. Your

right wheel is loose.

Kathleen relaxes. Feeling dumb for being scared.

KATHLEEN
Really?

THE MAN (0.S.)
I could tighten the lugs for you.

KATHLEEN
Would you?

THE MAN (0.S.)
Can't be too careful.

He goes back to his car and retrieves a LUG WRENCH. Kneels
down behind her back tire, out of sight. He's down there a
long time. Kathleen checks her rearview. Can't see him.
Just as she's getting nervous again....

THE MAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
All done.

She turns, he's STANDING by the passenger door.

KATHLEEN
Thank you.

THE MAN (0.S.)
No problem. Have a good night.

He walks away. Kathleen, watching him go back to his own
car. He gets behind the wheel. Starts back up. Headlights
on. Puts the car in gear. Pulls back onto the highway.

Passing her. She watches his tail lights go. She puts her
own car in drive and pulls out...

She only gets fifty yards when her RIGHT WHEEL CRUNCHES OFF
the axle in a SHOWER OF SPARKS! The baby, waking, CRYING...
Kathleen fights for control, wrenching the wheel right,
managing to pilot it to the shoulder. Kathleen, breathing
hard. Picks up her baby. Trying to quiet him. Through the
windshield, we see THE MAN'S CAR SLOWLY PULL A U-TURN.

She JUMPS at his voice. He's pulled alongside her.

KATHLEEN
Yeah, I- Yeah.

THE MAN (0.S.)
Must've been worse than I thought.
I could give you a lift toa
service station.

Kathleen looks back to her tire. Makes a decision. Gathers
up her baby and gets out of the car.

THE MAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
I didn't know you had a baby.

Kathleen stops.

KATHLEEN
Is that a problem?

A long beat...

THE MAN (0.S.)
The more the merrier.

INT. MAN'S CAR -- NIGHT 111

Trash everywhere. Kathleen slides into the passenger seat.
Her baby on her lap. They pull onto the highway. Riding in
silence. Quite fast. The baby, crying. Kathleen
uncomfortable. She lights a cigarette. Smokes a little.
Still the man doesn't speak. She stubs the butt out
nervously.

Finally sees a GAS STATION coming up. Relieved. But the Man
doesn't slow down. THEY PASS IT.

KATHLEEN
I think you passed a gas station.

THE MAN
It was closed.

She looks at him. Tries to regroup. They're SPEEDING UP.

Doing near 70. The Man CRANKS DOWN his WINDOW. Howling air
fills the car. Kathleen's Baby WHINES at the cold.

EXT. HIGHWAY 132 -- NIGHT 113
The Woman gets out of her car. Before she can even ask

TRUCK DRIVER
She was on the side of the road!

The hysterical woman is KATHLEEN and she's SCREAMING BLOODY
MURDER. Face cut bloody from jumping from the car. Gravel
in her hair. And no baby in sight.

WOMAN
What happened? What he do to you?

I didn't do nothing, lady! I found
her like this-

Kathleen, gasping and weeping as she tries to form words

The Woman, following her and we do to, as Kathleen slides

Her baby lies there. Perfectly fine. Safe. Alive.

So now I have a little list,
beginning with the woman and her
baby that I gave a rather
interesting ride for a couple
hours one evening a few months
back that ended in my burning her
car where I found them-

(puts down the

letter)
We're really not going to run
anymore of his letters?

He looks over to Avery who slugs back a shot. Quite drunk.

AVERY
Our brothers in blue want us to
hold off. To see how he "reacts".

GRAYSMITH
Four letters in three months and
he doesn't mention Kathleen Johns
till now...

That's because he's full of shit.

GRAYSMITH
I don't think we're supposed to be

AVERY

That's why I have keys, Robert. I
am a man with keys. Pull the
Modesto Bee from March for me.

I'm gonna sit and smoke.

Graysmith goes. Avery, true to his word, sits and lights up.
Graysmith's voice, from the stacks:

Kathleen Johns! Also, grab the
Chron from- Never mind, I'll find

Holds up the Chronicle. A FRONT PAGE STORY about a police
officer shooting.

AVERY (CONT'D)
Officer Richard Radietch, shot
sitting in his car.

GRAYSMITH
Zodiac said he shot someone in
their car-

AVERY

Couple days after this article
came out. Police already have
somebody in custody. Zodiac
didn't do it, but he took credit
anyway. He's in it for the press.

(drunken grin)
He's constructing an image. Shit,
he even stole his symbol.

GRAYSMITH
What?

On Avery. Realizing he might have said too much.
AVERY
If I tell you something, will you
promise not to tell anyone else?

GRAYSMITH
Who am I going to tell?

AVERY
Totally solid point. Okay.

He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket and hands it to
Graysmith, who unfolds it.

A Zodiac watch. Look at the face.

Graysmith does. And right in the center of the watch face is
the GUNSIGHT ZODIAC SYMBOL.

GRAYSMITH
Oh, my goodness...

AVERY
That's right. I think it's only
place that word and that symbol
have ever appeared together before
the letters. Guy stole his logo
off a watch.

GRAYSMITH
Why would someone who's killed
thirteen people do that?

AVERY

Claims he's killed thirteen
people. But which ones can we
actually confirm? The three in
Vallejo, the one at Berryessa, the
cabbie and that's it.

(off his look)
Bobby... you almost look
disappointed.

people call you "Shorty"?

SHORTY
Does it ever bother you that
people call you "retard"?

GRAYSMITH
Nobody calls me that.

Shorty just stares at him. Confused, Graysmith walks over to
Avery, who's sorting through his MAIL and watching the TV on
the wall, which plays a PRESS CONFERENCE.

overlooked in the murder of
Darlene Ferrin...

Avery, Toschi, Armstrong, Peck, and Hyman sit, a GREETING
CARD between them. SKELETON on the front.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET -- PAY PHONE -- NIGHT -- (RAIN) 129

Graysmith and Melanie, huddled half in and out of a phone
booth. Soaked as Graysmith feeds coins into the phone. Then
dials. Rotary. It's taking forever.

GRAYSMITH
Sorry. I'm sorry. It would be so
much easier if we had wrist
radios, wouldn't it?

MELANIE
I don't quite know how to answer
that, Robert.

He finishes dialing. Finally:

GRAYSMITH

It's ringing. Hello? Mrs. Avery?
Oh, Ms. St. James. But you are
married to Paul Avery? Good. Oh,
sorry, this is Robert Graysmith,
from the Chronicle. Is everything
all right?

(pause)
Well, no, of course everything
should be all right. I didn't
mean that it wasn't, I meant- I'm
sure you're fine, everyone's fine.
But, have you heard from Paul?

(pause)
I didn't mean you should have heard
from him- No, it's not a bad thing,
I just wanted to make sure he's, you
know... alive.

He winces at the response he gets...

EXT. RIVERSIDE -- NIGHT -- (RAIN) 130
Avery pulls up to a curb. Across the street, a fenced off

old CAR WASH. He rechecks the address. This is it. He

shuts the engine and gets out of the car. Crosses the

street. Hops the fence. Approaching the dark building...

AVERY
Hello?

MELANIE
Good.
GRAYSMITH

(can't believe it)
I actually have to go home. To
wait for the call.
Melanie stares at him.
MELANIE
Is this some sleazy plan to get me
to come back to your place?

GRAYSMITH
Oh, my goodness, no, I'm sorry-

MELANIE
I'll get the food to go.

EXT. ABANDONED CAR WASH -- NIGHT -- (RAIN) 132

Avery tries the glass door. Locked. Knocks. Nothing.
Wipes some dirt off. Squints through. Nobody inside.

AVERY
Hello? I'm supposed to meet
someone?

No reply. Avery steps back. Collecting himself. He walks
around the building. Comes to the car entrance.

AVERY (CONT'D)
Hello? Is anyone in there?

No response. Avery takes a few tentative steps in.

AVERY (CONT'D)
I got your letter?

Still nothing. He fumbles out his gun. Waving it around in
a terrible parody of a cop. More steps in.

AVERY (CONT'D)
I have a gun!

MOVEMENT behind him. He whips around and points the shaky
gun at A MAN STANDING THERE. An awkward moment.

Graysmith, phone by his side. Up all night. Melanie curled
up on the couch, still in her dress. She blinks awake.

MELANIE
Anything?

GRAYSMITH
No. You don't have to stay-

MELANIE
Are you kidding? This is the most
interesting date I've ever had-
THE PHONE RINGS. Graysmith, snatching it up:

Toschi finds Captain Lee and Armstrong watching a MORNING
NEWSCAST on Lee's small portable black and white TV:

NEWSCASTER

...in a bizarre twist, the hunted
has become hunter. Chronicle
Reporter and Zodiac target Paul
Avery claims to have uncovered new
information regarding the only
unsolved homicide in Riverside
County's history - a 1966 Southern
California murder that Avery now
believes was the Zodiac's first
victim.

TOSCHI
What?

CAPTAIN LEE
He didn't call you about this?

ARMSTRONG
(pointing at TV)
Hang on.

Now showing FOOTAGE of an INTERVIEW with Avery:

AVERY
(on TV)
The Riverside killer wrote to the
press letters that I took
personally to the Office of
Questioned Documents.

INTERVIEWER
(on TV)
And what did this expert tell you?

AVERY
(on TV)
What I knew in my gut, Ron. The
handwriting matches Zodiac's...

ARMSTRONG
How'd he get the evidence out of
Riverside?

TOSCHI

He took it to Sherwood without
telling us, that son of a bitch...

You know how bad this looks?

TOSCHI
We don't know how real the lead is-

ARMSTRONG
It's very real. You know how I
know? Because I saw it on TV.

Silence. They know he's right.

CAPTAIN LEE
Get on a plane, but keep it quiet.
If it hits the press you're
meeting in Riverside, it
automatically confirms Avery's
story, right or wrong.

137 INT. PLANE -- DAY 137

November 16, 1970. Toschi finding his seat next to Narlow
and MEL NICOLAI.

NARLOW
Dave, you know Mel Nicolai, he's
working the case for Justice?

TOSCHI
Good to see you, Mel.

NICOLAI
All due respect, can someone explain
to me why I'm reading about breaks
in this case in the Chronicle
instead of getting calls from you?

TOSCHI
They screwed us.

NARLOW
Dave, you do get your name in the

Narlow and Nicolai look on in disbelief.

AVERY (CONT'D)
Paul Avery, good to meet you, Paul
Avery. Can I catch a ride with
you gents when we land?

TOSCHI
Not a good idea, Paul.

AVERY
I gotta take a cab? We're going
to the same place-

Fair enough, fair enough.

He heads a few rows back to his seat as Narlow and Nicolai
stare daggers at Toschi...

Toschi, Narlow, and Nicolai shuffle into CAPTAIN IRV CROSS's
office. Toschi, extending a hand.

TOSCHI
Thanks for seeing us, Captain.

CAPTAIN CROSS
Not at all. You have some files

for us?

TOSCHI
I'll show you mine you show me

CAPTAIN CROSS (CONT'D)
Studying in the library the night
of October 30, 1966, left with an
unidentified male at closing - 9
P.M., body was found the next
morning in the parking lot stabbed
to death. Her car was disabled,
someone pulled the distributor
coil which caused the battery to
die. The suspect shows up, offers
to help-

NARLOW
Like Kathleen Johns?

CAPTAIN CROSS
Who?

NARLOW
A woman outside of Modesto, might
be a Zodiac victim-

TOSCHI
Might be. Her account's in,
uhhhh, this file.

He taps one of the many on Cross's desk.

CAPTAIN CROSS
Okay - A typewritten confession
was sent to the Riverside Press
Enterprise November 29th, a month
after Bates' murder. They ran it.

He hands them copies. Narlow, reading:

NARLOW
"IT am not sick, I am insane, but
that will not stop the game. This
letter should be published for all
to read"- He wants to publish, he
calls it a game, sounds like our
boy.

CAPTAIN CROSS
Six months later, the police, the
girl's father, and the paper all
received these.

He slides them a second letter, this one handscrawled:
BATES HAD TO DIE

THERE WILL BE MORE

TOSCHI
Double postage, like Zodiac.

A Riverside Officer enters, carrying a small LIBRARY DESK.

CAPTAIN CROSS (CONT'D)
This was found a couple months
later in library storage.

The cops crowd around it. The poem, carved into wood.

Sick of living/ unwilling to die
cut. Clean. If red/

clean. Blood spurting

dripping

Spilling;

All over her new

it was red

anyway.

Life draining into an
uncertain death. She won't
die.

This time. Someone 11 find her

next time.

NICOLAI
Sherwood got a handwriting match
off wood? Nobody carves in their
true handwriting.

CAPTAIN CROSS
Also, our letters and your
letters, they don't bear much
resemblance.

He puts "Bates had to Die" next to the Paul Stine letter.
NARLOW

How did Paul Avery get the
exemplars to give to Sherwood?

CAPTAIN CROSS
I gave them to him. We spoke at
length, and I told him we were

TOSCHI
You told him?

CAPTAIN CROSS
Yes. I also told him we don't
think this was Zodiac.

Toschi blinks.

TOSCHI
Wait a minute-

CAPTAIN CROSS
We have a guy we like for it.
Don't have enough to make it stick
yet, but we're pretty sure it's
him.

TOSCHI
If you don't think it's Zodiac, why
did you give anything to Avery?

CAPTAIN CROSS
I'm trying to cooperate-

TOSCHI
By giving information to
reporters?

NARLOW

(trying to defuse)
Look, I don't know from
handwriting but Sherwood says it's
a match, right? So maybe your guy
did Cheri Jo, typed the
confession, Zodiac saw it in the
paper and wrote the letter to take
credit. He's done that before.

CAPTAIN CROSS
Look, you now have everything we
have, but in my opinion? You all
came south for nothing.

Problem is, the entire state

Narlow spies AVERY across the street, waiting for them.

NARLOW
Why don't you complain to your
press agent?

As Avery approaches, Narlow and Nicolai take off. Toschi
deliberately moves in the other direction.

TOSCHI
Really don't want to talk to you
right now, Paul-

AVERY

Dave, just a few questions-
TOSCHI

Not now.
AVERY

It's news. I'm doing my job-

TOSCHI
Well, now I can't do my job, Paul.
We're already screwed with the
amount of tips we get and you just
freaked out the entire state!

TOSCHI (CONT'D) AVERY
I've got Vallejo, Napa, and (as he writes)
DOJ looking at me sideways, "'Out of the frying pan and
Riverside telling me I'm ona into the fire' the normally

AVERY
Tell that to Sherwood! I'm
beating the bushes, trying to draw
him out! We're in this together-

TOSCHI
No, we're not in this together

latest in a countless string of interviews.

I think my mailman is the Zodiac
Killer...

We begin a series of CUTS - DIFFERENT INFORMANTS, different
locations - talking to either Toschi or Armstrong:

Zodiac, I'd just finished porking
her, women don't lie then...

July 26, 1971 - Torrance, California. Armstrong sits with
DON CHENEY and SANDY PANZARELLA.

PANZARELLA
We were roommates with Leigh's
brother in college and Leigh would
come down sometimes. Then- Tell
him about the conversation-

CHENEY
New Year's Day, 68. I go over to
Leigh's house. He'd been out of
work a couple months.

ARMSTRONG
What did he do?

CHENEY
He was a teacher. Lost his job
over "politics" or something.

Teacher - fired? goes onto the pad below New Year's 68.

CHENEY (CONT'D)
He was drinkin' Coors, getting a
load on. Starts talking about
hunting people, like that book.
Says how you can put a light ona
gun to use as a sight in the dark-

ARMSTRONG
He said that?

CHENEY

Yeah. So I ask him, "How would
you get away with it?" He says
it'd be easy, cause there'd be no
real motive to the thing. Then he
says he'd write letters to the
police and call himself Zodiac to
mess with ‘em.

PANZARELLA
Leigh liked messing with people.

You're sure it was "Zodiac"?

CHENEY
Yeah, I thought it was a stupid
name. So I told him. He gets all
upset and says "I don't care what
you think, I thought about it a
long time, and that's the name I'm
gonna use."

ARMSTRONG
He'd been thinking about it a long
time.

CHENEY

He was raw about losing his job at
the school. Talked about shooting
out the tires of a school bus and
picking off the "little darlings".

ARMSTRONG
He used those words?

CHENEY
That's what made me remember.
Afterwards I told my wife I didn't
wanna see him again and I haven't
since. Other thing is, Leigh's
into skindiving. I know he's been
up to that lake a bunch of times,
the one in Napa-

ARMSTRONG
Berryessa. Did you ever go with
him?

CHENEY

Couple times we went fishing by
Putah Creek near there.

PANZARELLA
Tell him when you put it together.

CHENEY
About a year ago in the paper,
there was a story about the
Zodiac, and it all comes back. I
tried to call the local cops-
PANZARELLA
They blew him off. Thought he was
a nut.

would take it seriously.

ARMSTRONG
And you're sure your conversation
about Zodiac happened on the first
day of 1968?

CHENEY
Couldn't have been any later cause
I started a new job in LA on
January 20th. I had to move.

TOSCHI
Here's the problem. This guy...

ARMSTRONG
Arthur Leigh Allen.

TOSCHI
This guy Allen, he just lays out
his entire evil plan to a fishing
buddy on New Year's Day?

ARMSTRONG
I don't know. He's angry, he's
drinking, he's been thinking about
it for awhile... I can buy that.

TOSCHI
Why didn't Cheney come to us sooner?

ARMSTRONG
I checked, he tried. First
recorded contact with a PD about
Allen was in Pomona, January 10th,
1970. He got lost in the shuffle.

He was a public school teacher,
they should still have a record of

NICOLAI
Yeah. What school?

ARMSTRONG

Valley Springs. Also, he may have
been in the Navy which matches up
with the boots thing.

NICOLAI
I'll see what I can get for you.
You throw a heads-up to Mulanax?

ARMSTRONG
I was about to.

NICOLAI
Have him check Vallejo banks, if
Allen's got an account they should
have check stubs.

says it doesn't look like Z. He's
not ruling him out, but he can't
rule him in either.

ARMSTRONG
Well, that's... vague.
TOSCHI

He needs more samples. Oh, also -
our guy's a perv. When Mel got
the application from Valley
Springs, they told him Allen had
been fired for touching kids.

ARMSTRONG
Touching?

TOSCHI
Polite euphemism. What do you
want to do?

Very Leigh.

ARMSTRONG
What about the handwriting?

PANZARELLA
I don't know. Don't you have
experts for that stuff?

ARMSTRONG
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

PANZARELLA
Maybe he did it with his other
hand.

ARMSTRONG

The letters are a little too neat
for someone to have written with
the wrong hand-

PANZARELLA
Not for Leigh.

Armstrong leans forward in his chair.

ARMSTRONG
What do you mean?

PANZARELLA
He's ambidextrous. He can write
with both hands. Didn't you know
that?

Toschi and Armstrong, sitting with Captain Lee.

ARMSTRONG
Here's our theory - In every day
life Allen uses his left hand, job
applications, letters to friends,

Zodiac letters with his right hand
producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

Close cropped buzzcut with graying hair. Confused.

Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill
Armstrong, this is Inspector David
Toschi, and that's Sergeant Jack
Mulanax - we're investigating the
Zodiac murders in San Francisco
and Vallejo. Sit, please.

Allen does. Nervous.

ARMSTRONG (CONT'D)
An informant notified us that you
made certain statements eleven
months prior to the first Zodiac
murder and if they're true,
they're quite incriminating. Do
you recall having any such
conversation?

LEIGH ALLEN
No.

MULANAX
Have you ever read or heard about
the Zodiac?

Allen, surprised the second cop has joined in.
LEIGH ALLEN
When it was first in the papers,
sure. I didn't follow up after
those first reports.

No. But it was right after the
murder at the Lake.

MULANAX
And what did you tell this officer?

LEIGH ALLEN
I told him that I'd gone to Salt
Point that weekend to skin dive.
I was alone but I met a couple
there. I have their names at home
if you want them.

MULANAX
That would be great, Arthur.

LEIGH ALLEN
Leigh.

MULANAX
What?

LEIGH ALLEN
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me. It was about
four. I forgot to tell the
officer about that.

What's your neighbor's name?

LEIGH ALLEN

Bill White. But he died about a
week afterwards. Heart attack.

So I never called to follow up.

We'll be checking on that. Let me
ask you something else, were you
in Southern California at any time
during 1966?

LEIGH ALLEN
You mean about the Riverside
killing?

A beat.

MULANAX
Yes.

LEIGH ALLEN
I guess I was down there around

Armstrong looks over at Toschi, who still hasn't spoken.
"Do you want to jump in?" Toschi stays quiet. Observing.

TOSCHI
That's a nice watch.

LEIGH ALLEN
Thank you.

TOSCHI
Can I see it?

Allen holds it up for them. It's the Zodiac Watch.

TOSCHI (CONT'D)
Where did you get it?

LEIGH ALLEN
It was a Christmas gift from my
mother two years ago.

TOSCHI
That's sweet. Tell me something,
Arthur, do you remember anyone you
might have had a conversation with
regarding the Zodiac?

LEIGH ALLEN
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker at
Vallejo Recreation, but I'm not
positive. I used to work there...

Ohhhh, The Most Dangerous Game!

It's about this man who waits for

Okay. Guys?

Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen,
current residence, Sunset Trailer

Physical description - Allen is
similar in height, weight, and
build to a man seen at Lake
Berryessa the day of the
stabbings.

SANTA ROSA D.A.
I understand he doesn't look much
like the San Francisco composite.

sketchy, but lumbering Caucasian
with crewcut is right on-

the composite from the kids - even
the patrolman who saw Zodiac said
he didn't look much like that
sketch.

Navy man and wears size 10 1/2, the
same size found at Berryessa-

SANTA ROSA D.A. (0.S.)

ARMSTRONG
Tucker also told us he had a
conversation with Allen about how
to attach a flashlight to the
barrel of a gun.

CAPTAIN LEE
John, that's two sources on the
ciphers and two on the flashlight.

SANTA ROSA D.A. (0.S.)
What about his threats on
children?

CAPTAIN LEE
Suspect worked at elementary
schools and was fired for
molestation in March/April '68 -
could give him motive.

ARMSTRONG
At the very least, it's home turf;
he'd have knowledge of bus routes,
which both threats centered
around.

SANTA ROSA D.A. (0.S.)
What about the bomb?

front of a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS filled with KIDS.

(note - from here till the end of the written dialogue Clint
Eastwood does not appear onscreen - in other words CLINT
EASTWOOD WILL NOT APPEAR IN THIS MOVIE). A LITTLE GIRL tries
to get off the bus, interrupting his ransom call:

SCORPIO KILLER
-come on now, honey, that's a good
girl, back in the bus...
(she goes - into

And I've got the bus driver. Here
she is, just tell him.

TOSCHI
You want some popcorn?

TOSCHI'S WIFE
Do you want me to come with you?

He shakes his head. Rises and heads for the exit, scooting
past other audience members, enraptured by the movie. Only
one other person in the theater notices Toschi go-

GRAYSMITH. Sitting with MELANIE. He watches Toschi leave...

Toschi turns to see Graysmith. He looks shaken by the whole

first time. Toschi stares at him.

TOSCHI
I know you.

GRAYSMITH
I work at the Chronicle. Robert
Graysmith - maybe Paul Avery's

TOSCHI
No, that's not it...

They shake hands, Graysmith masking his disappointment.

TOSCHI (CONT'D)

Behind them, the THEATER DOORS OPEN. The invigorated
audience pours out, headed for the afterparty. The POLICE
COMMISSIONER, passes by, in high spirits.

POLICE COMMISSIONER
Dave! That Harry Callahan did a
hell of a job closing your case,
huh?

TOSCHI
Sure did, Commissioner. Good
thing he didn't let due process

He bounces his daughter MARGOT who coos.

NEWSCASTER (0.S.)
-.-has confirmed that columnist
Jimmy Breslin of the New York
Daily News has received a letter
penned by the Son of Sam. Dubbed
the .44 Caliber Killer by the
press and later "Son of Sam" by
himself, the killer began his
rampage in 1976, targeting couples
in parked cars, and communicating
with authorities through a series
of handwritten letters.

Interest piqued, Graysmith heads to the LIVING ROOM. More
feminine now that a wife lives here. It's late, everyone
else asleep.

NEWSCASTER (0.S.) (CONT'D)
If any of this sounds familiar to
our viewers, it's because our own
fair city once had a very similar
brush with the macabre. In light
of the events in New York,
tonight, we look back on what
police call "A Cold Case",
possibly the most famous in
history - The Zodiac.

Graysmith sits. Intrigued. FOOTAGE of Zodiac Letters.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Shortly after a connection was
established between an unsolved
1966 murder in Riverside and the
Cipher Slayer, Zodiac's letters
became more infrequent, and
finally nil. Many believe he is
dead. But Inspector David Toschi
has different ideas.

Toschi, who rose to public
prominence for his investigations
into both the Zodiac and the Zebra
Murders, is currently making
headlines as the next possible
Chief of Police. Along with his
partner William Armstrong, Toschi
is the only San Francisco
detective still working a case
that at one time commanded the
attention of hundreds of
policemen. Now it's down to just
two. And the killer, still at

place, you can have it.

Armstrong looks out the window - his WIFE stands in the door
to the building, waiting. Toschi sees her too. Strange.
Armstrong turns back to Toschi. Has to tell him.

ARMSTRONG
You should keep the car.

TOSCHI
Yeah?

ARMSTRONG
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

TOSCHI
What's up?

ARMSTRONG
I'm done. I put in for a

ARMSTRONG

I'm looking at fraud. I can't be

No worry at all, my friend.
Nobody comes by from the old days -

Avery smiles at him and settles into a chair.

Nobody knows more about the case

something loose-

AVERY
Lost the files.

GRAYSMITH
(horrified)
You lost them?

AVERY
Lost them or tossed them, who
cares, man?

GRAYSMITH
But you wanted to be in charge of
the investigation!

AVERY

That was a long time ago.

We work in the daily business as
in to-day. What did you think we
were doing back then? You didn't
really think it was important?

(off his look;

laughing)
Oh, Jesus... We were just trying
to sell newspapers. More people
die in three months on the East
Bay commute than that idiot

He turns back to face Avery.
GRAYSMITH

I don't care what you say. It was

AVERY
Well, what the fuck did you ever
do about it?

GRAYSMITH
What-

AVERY
If it was so important, what did
you do? Hovered over my desk?
Stole shit out of wastebaskets?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm being unkind.

What's happening with it really?
Day to day?

TOSCHI
We're actively pursuing all leads-

GRAYSMITH
It's just you now, isn't it.

TOSCHI
Mr. Graysmith, Zodiac hasn't
written in three years. Do you
know how many murders San
Francisco has had since then?

GRAYSMITH
No.

TOSCHI
Over two hundred. That's a lot of
dead people and grieving families
who need our help.

GRAYSMITH
So nobody cares anymore?

Toschi puts down his burger.

TOSCHI
Hey. JI care.

GRAYSMITH
Can I show you something?

Toschi shrugs. Graysmith pulls a stack of books from his

GRAYSMITH (CONT'D)
I know you thought Zodiac was
military so I went to every base
library and got a list of people
who checked out the books. That's
when I found this.

He points to the PRESIDIO LIBRARY LIST. Almost the entire
column of books have the word "MISSING" written by them.

TOSCHI
"Missing"?

GRAYSMITH
That means the book was stolen.

TOSCHI
Almost every book on ciphers was
stolen from the Presidio Library?

GRAYSMITH
And the Oakland Army Terminal
Library. Someone didn't want to
leave a record of checking them
out, so he stole them.

Toschi stares at him.

TOSCHI
Who are you again?

GRAYSMITH
I just want to help.

A beat. Toschi, mulling this over. Finally:

TOSCHI
I can't allow you to help. I
can't have more meetings with you

brother-in-law, and one to her

NICOLAI
Okay, I'll play. Let's say this
call did take place. And let's
say it really was Zodiac. Why
would he volunteer the day he was
born? Plus, nobody died on
December 18th. Just like nobody
died over the weekend when he was
going to kill a dozen people, or
when he threatened to shoot school
kids and blow up buses. He's a
liar, Mr. Graysmith.

The Zodiac Killer is so full of

Graysmith walks with Morrill through his GARDEN. Every so

MORRILL
Can a fingerprint give you the key
to a criminal's mental state? Can
a shell casing give you insight to
motive?

GRAYSMITH
No?

MORRILL
Zodiac uses a mixture of cursive
and printing. Most of us do. We
choose at some point in our lives,
how to physically construct each
letter. Once we lock this into
our brains, our handwriting may
change over the years, but the
moves themselves will remain
unaltered. Do you understand?

Yes.

NEWSCASTER (0.S.)
Good evening. Our top story
tonight, the San Francisco Police
Department has confirmed that the
man who called himself Zodiac and
terrorized the Bay Area has broken
his silence of fifty one months.
In a letter claiming "I am back
with you" the Zodiac makes no
overt threats against the
citizenry, and muses that his life
and times would make the basis for
a good movie. The terse sixty-six
word missive also manages to
mention both San Francisco
Chronicle Columnist Herb Caen and
the Department's own Inspector
David Toschi by name. Are they
targets? Or is something more at
work here? Our team coverage on
the Cipher Slayer's Return begins
as Alan Freeman has more...

DURING THIS - Graysmith looks up reflexively. Then sees
Melanie staring at him. He tries to be good. The kids,
watching this tennis match of looks. Takes a bite.

GRAYSMITH
These carrots are delicious-

MELANIE
Oh, just go.

Graysmith bolts out of his chair and rushes into the living
room. The kids follow. ON TV:

REPORTER
...-Thank you, Eric. These
personal mentions have drawn
controversial accusations from at
least one source tonight as San
Francisco Chronicle columnist
Armistead Maupin has charged that
not only is the new letter be a
forgery, but that it was written
by Toschi himself - the very man
charged to hunt the Killer.

REPORTER
Maupin, a respected author best
known for his "Tales of the City"
stories, has gone on the record
saying he believes Toschi wrote
the letter to drum up publicity
for himself. And the theory is
gaining strength. Sources wishing
to remain anonymous within the
Hall of Justice say that Toschi
has always had a weak spot where
publicity was concerned...

TOSCHI'S WIFE, on the phone with Graysmith. Speaking in
hushed tones so her husband doesn't overhear. INTERCUT:

TOSCHI'S WIFE
Maupin used David as a character
in his column. David got a kick
out of it so he wrote a couple
anonymous letters asking for the
character to be brought back. It
was like writing fan mail to
himself, that's all. But David
didn't write that letter.

trying to get his prints? Handed
him a photo to look at. He takes
it, is about to hand it back when
he stops and says "My goodness, I
got fingerprints all over this."
Then he wipes them off.

GRAYSMITH
Why wasn't he ever tested for
handwriting?

NARLOW

Because they finally did get his
prints and cleared him against the
one in Stine's cab.

GRAYSMITH
(deflating)
So it's not him.

NARLOW
Maybe yes, maybe no.

GRAYSMITH
What do you mean?

NARLOW
Zodiac left gloves behind. If you
have the foresight to wear gloves
while committing a murder, how the
hell do you leave a fingerprint?

GRAYSMITH
But it was in blood. They found
it at the scene-

NARLOW
All it takes is one curious
civilian or cop to reach out and
touch something and boom - false
print. Take a look at the crime
scene photos, the cab wasn't that
secure.

GRAYSMITH
That print was used to disqualify
thousands of suspects.

nothing like the Z letters so they
moved on.

GRAYSMITH
What if he didn't write the sign?

My thoughts exactly. Marshall was a
Navy man, received code training.
He used to work as a projectionist
at a silent film theater-

the films he projected was "The
Most Dangerous Game"?

reel before they're shown, but it
always arrives with it. First time
I saw it in the papers, I
immediately thought of this.

Graysmith looks - STANDARD ACADEMY LEADER COUNTDOWN, which
looks EXACTLY LIKE A ZODIAC SIGN.

GRAYSMITH
We got a tip that Rick left a film
canister with you. Something he
told you never to open.

VAUGHN
A "tip" about a "mysterious film
canister"?

GRAYSMITH
Is it true?

Vaughn stares at him. Finally:

VAUGHN
Yes.

GRAYSMITH
Have you opened it?

VAUGHN
No.

VAUGHN (CONT'D)
And this "tip" is how you got it
in your head that Rick's the
Zodiac?

GRAYSMITH
That and the movie posters.

VAUGHN
Excuse me?

Graysmith fumbles out the folded poster.

GRAYSMITH
The handwriting on the posters
Rick did. It's the closest we've
ever come to a match-

VAUGHN
Rick didn't draw any posters.

GRAYSMITH
What? No, he did this one-

VAUGHN
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters
personally. That's my handwriting.

An awful moment. Graysmith looks to the locked door. Vaughn
stares at him. Hard. Graysmith puts on a brave face.
Rises.

GRAYSMITH
I won't take any more of your time-

VAUGHN
Not at all. Before you go, I should
check on when we played that film.

GRAYSMITH
I don't want to trouble you-

No trouble. The records are just

INT. VAUGHN'S BASEMENT -- NIGHT 220

The door CREAKS OPEN. Vaughn and Graysmith stand at the top
of a rickety wooden staircase. We hear WATER DRIPPING
somewhere down in the darkness. Vaughn flicks a switch, a
naked bulb snaps on somewhere below. Very little light.

Graysmith really doesn't want to be here. Vaughn leads him
down the stairs, hand on his back as they walk.

VAUGHN
The very detailed posters I kept,
but the one-off cheapos like that
one there I just threw into the
back alley... Here we go.

They finally stop by an overstuffed bookshelf. Vaughn pulls
one handbound volume from it and begins flipping through the
pages. Graysmith looks around, nervous.

The bulb above them flickers. Vaughn reaches up and tweaks
it with a finger - the light goes constant again. Above
Graysmith's head, the CEILING BOARDS CREAK. As though
someone were WALKING AROUND UPSTAIRS.

GRAYSMITH
You live alone?

Vaughn nods absently, still searching the book.

VAUGHN
Here it is. "The Most Dangerous
Game" - ran it May 1969. That

would have been about nine weeks
before the first Zodiac letter,
correct?

Graysmith, still looking up at the ceiling.

Graysmith turns and heads for the stairs. Forcing himself to
walk, not run. He climbs them, getting into...

INT. VAUGHN'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 221

Graysmith emerges from the cellar. Looking around. No one.
He hurries to the door, grasps the knob and... LOCKED. From
the inside. Graysmith looks for the bolt. No way to unlock
it. He's TRAPPED. The floorboards creak behind him and he
SPINS TO SEE... VAUGHN. Standing in the cellar doorway.
Slowly walking towards him. Menacing. Reaching into his
pocket... and pulling out the KEY. He steps past Graysmith
and unlocks the door for him.

VAUGHN
Have a good night.
EXT. GRAYSMITH APARTMENT -- DAWN 222

Graysmith exits his car, guzzling coffee, hair crazed. Just

Told the cops about it forever

boys around, even though she was
married. This one guy was weird,
though. He used to bring her
presents from Mexico. I don't
know why she was friends with him.
She once told me he'd killed

somebody.

GRAYSMITH
Really?

LINDA
Yup. Maybe when he was in the
service.

GRAYSMITH
The Navy?

LINDA
I think so.

GRAYSMITH

Was he into movies?

LINDA
He wasn't into people, I can tell
you that. This party Darlene
threw, people were supposed to
show up, have beers, help paint.
This dude shows up in a suit. He
sat alone in a chair, didn't talk
to anyone. Creeped me out.
Darlene told me not to go near
him. She was scared of him.
Couple weeks later, she was dead.

She takes a long shaky drag on her cigarette.

How can you be sure? Think hard-

MIKE MAGEAU being led by security to the private room.

Bedraggled hair, skittish face. Life has not been kind...

INT. ONTARIO AIRPORT -- PRIVATE ROOM -- MORNING

The door opens and Bawart looks up from a YEARBOOK PHOTO of
Young Mike Mageau, to see the real version standing in front

of him. He rises, extending a hand.

BAWART
Mr. Mageau, thank you for seeing
me.

MIKE
You're the one I talked to on the
phone?

BAWART

Yes, sir, George Bawart, Vallejo
PD, I took over the case from Jack
Mulanax.

MIKE
It's been twenty two years, I
don't know how I can help you...

BAWART
This is just a formality. I'm
going to show you a group of
photographs. The person that shot
you may or may not be among this
group of photographs. You don't
have to pick anybody out just
because I'm showing you these
pictures. Do you understand?

MIKE
Yes, sir, I do.

Bawart picks up the envelope and extracts a PHOTO ARRAY from
it. LEIGH ALLEN'S FACE among five others. He places the
photo array down on the table.
Mike frowns, staring down at the different pictures...
BAWART
Take your time. If you don't
recognize anyone that's okay.

Mike stares at the pictures for 15 seconds. Then:

MIKE
That's him.

Mike stabs his finger down at a picture. A YOUNG ARTHUR
LEIGH ALLEN. Bawart blinks.

BAWART
How sure are you?

MIKE
Pretty sure. He had a round face
like this guy.

He points to the picture of a SECOND MAN.
BAWART
Are you identifying this second
person as well?
MIKE
No, no, just that he has a round
face like that. It's this man.

He taps the photo of Allen.

BAWART
On a scale of one to ten, how sure
are you?

MIKE

It's at least an eight. Only

other time I saw this face was on

July 4, 1969. I'm very sure

that's the man who shot me.

CUT TO:

A BLACK SCREEN. 242
Silence. The following words appear:
In 1991 Arthur Leigh Allen's basement was searched by the
Vallejo Police Department. In it were found bomb diagrams,
explosive devices, 7 handguns, 4 rifles, and codebooks.
In order to secure the warrant, Don Cheney, the man who first
implicated Allen as the Zodiac, was given a polygraph test.
He passed with flying colors.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 194.
CONTINUED: 242

Following Mike Mageau's identification of Allen as the Zodiac
Police were scheduled to meet on August 27, 1992 to discuss
arresting him for the murders.

Allen suffered a fatal heart attack one day before this
meeting took place. No arrest was ever made.

These words fade. Replaced by:

Inspector David Toschi retired from the San Francisco Police
Department in 1989. He was completely cleared of all charges
that he wrote the 1978 Zodiac letter.

Politically destroyed by the allegation, however, he never
rose above the rank of Inspector.

These words fade. Replaced by:

In 2001 DNA tests were run on several of the Zodiac
envelopes. The San Francisco lab claimed DNA found under the
stamps did not match Arthur Leigh Allen's.

Some believe these tests exonerated Arthur Leigh Allen.
Others believe Zodiac would not have licked his own stamps
since saliva typing tests were already common in 1969.

In 2004, the San Francisco Police Department officially
deactivated the Zodiac investigation. The Zodiac cases in
Vallejo, Napa, and Solano County remain open to this day.
These words fade. Replaced by:

Today Robert Graysmith lives in San Francisco and enjoys a
healthy relationship with his children. Many people believe
he was wrong in his conclusions on the Zodiac case.

The anonymous phone calls he was receiving abruptly ceased in
1992. Not a single one has occurred since Allen's death.
