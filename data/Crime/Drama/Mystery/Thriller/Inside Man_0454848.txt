INT. DALTON’S CELL - UNDETERMINED

Pan right to left across a cream-painted cinder block wall.
Various items taped to the wat!. A page from Playboy, a
handwritten calendar, bible quotations on scrap paper, a
checklist. We pan left to the adjacent wall and stop in an
ECU of DALTON RUSSELL, 36, white, with ten days of beard.

AS WE PULL BACK:

DALTON
My name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict
attention to what | say, because | choose
my words carefully, and | never repeat
myself.

He wears no shirt. A tattoo on his chest says “Murder wil|
out. Certain, it will not fail - Chaucer.” He reads a small,
worn Bible, wears white light cotton drawstring pants, and
sits up on a mattress with his back to the wail.

DALTON (CONT ’D)
|’ve toid you my name. That's the ‘who’
The ‘where’ could most readily be
described as a prison cell. But there's a
vast difference between being stuck’“in a
tiny cell and being in prison. And | am
not in prison. The ‘what’ is easy.
Recentiy, | planned, and set in motion
events to execute, the perfect bank
robbery. That's aiso the ‘when’. As for
the ‘why', beyond the obvious financial
motivation, it’s exceedingly simple:
Because | can. Which leaves us only with
the ‘how’. And therein, as the Bard would
tell us, lies the rub.

INT. PRECINCT - OFFICE OF CAPTAIN CAPELLIN? — 9:15 AM

Miller is seated in a chair in front of the desk, staring
around the room at various items on the desk and walls.

CAPTAIN CAPELLINI, 45, !talian-American, enters, rounds his
desk, and casually drops a GOLD DETECT!VE'S SHIELD on the
desk in front of Miller.

CAPELLINI
Congratulations, Detective First Grade.

INT. PERFECT PAINTERS VAN - 9:57 AM

STEVE, 30, a muscular white male, sits in the driver's seat,
dressed like a painter ready for an industrial job. He wears
a disposable white paper/plastic jumpsuit, matching haircover
and shoe-covers. A pair of goggies obscures his eyes.
mouthguard covers his mouth. In the passenger scat sits
STEVIE, 28, a woman dressed in the same manner. She also
wears her goggles and mouthguard, hiding her facial details.
In the rear of the van, which has no seats, sits STEVE-O, 40,
disguised exactly like Steve, but slimmer, shorter and tess
imposing. We cannot identify their faces. Their fourth
accomplice, Dalton, they refer to as Steven. The confusion is
intentional. Coltectively, they are THE CREW.

Steve parks the van and turns it off. He and Stevie exit the
van and walk to the rear.

EXT. PERFECT PAINTERS VAN - 9:58 AM

They open the rear doors and remove a large amount of
supplies, most of which is in nondescript brown cardboard
boxes. Steve wears a large black knapsack hanging from one
shoulder. They place the boxes on two hand trucks, shut the
van doors, and proceed around a corner to the entrance of the
bank, a large traditional bank facade with floor to ceiling
marble pillars, modern glass doors and smali windows. Nobody
seems to notice them.

EXT. TO INT. BANK - 10:00 AM

The Crew enter the bank like painters approaching a job.
Steve secures the doors with a pre-fitted metal brace.

BANG, Chaos.

Stevie sets off three smal! explosives. Loud noises and smoke
fill the bank and cause chaos but harm no one. People scream
and run or hit the floor. Steve-O and Stevie pull M16s from
Steve's knapsack. Dalton pulls on his goggles and mouthguard,
removes his flannel shirt and pulls out a Smith & Wesson .357
revolver.

DALTON

Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
Now! You have four seconds. Anyone sti li
standing gets shot! One. Two. Three.

Sitence. A beat. Dalton looks around. Only Chaim is still
standing. Dalton watks up to him, points his gun at him.

withdrawal from this bank. !f you get in

Dalton paints a forced smile on his face for a moment, then
drops it quickly, and his expression is cold and blank

DALTON (CONT ’D)
Plenty of people out there waiting for
your kidneys, hearts and livers.

EXT. BANK ENTRANCE - 10:08 AM

SERGEANT COLLINS, 28, white male, approaches the door of the
bank. He can see the interior is filled with smoke. He tries
to open the door. It is locked. He draws his gun. He pushes
the button on his shoulder radio.

COLLINS
Possible Ten-Thirty. Manhattan Trust
Bank, corner of 23rd and 8th.

The door suddenly opens a crack. Dalton’s .357 revolver is
pointing at Coltins’ head. Collins freezes.

DALTON
Get back! I've got hostages. You fucking
cops come near this door and }"11 start
killing people. I'm not kidding man.

Dalton slams the door shut and replaces the brace.

Inside, Dalton's expression quickly returns to calm, He
smiles confidently, satisfied with this performance.

DALTON

but in the end it's better for all of you
if you just do what | say. Now, | need

everybody to take your cellular phones,
and your keys out of your pockets and
handbags, and hold them in the air.

Steve-0 enters the room. Dalton takes a stick of CHEWING GUM
from a pack, unwraps it, places the gum in his mouth and the
wrapper in his pocket. All the employees take out their
ce{lular phones and keys. Dalton grabs a garbage bag and
collects the phones from the employees, until he reaches

Dalton reaches into his bag of cel} phones and pulls out four
of them. He hands the bag to Steve-O. Then he pushes buttons
on one of the phones. He then tosses the phone to Steve-O,
who catches it. Dalton repeats this motion with another cell
phone. On the third phone, he succeeds. He pushes the TALK
button on the phone. We see the readout on the cel! phone in
his hand: “P Hammond cel!". [na few seconds, we hear the
sound of a celtular phone ringing somewhere in the room
Peter Hammond's expression says he knows he screwed up.

Steve-0 retrieves the cell phone from a corner of the room,
where PETER had tossed it surreptitiously.

Dalton and Steve-O exit the room. The employees look around
at each other cautiously, but nobody speaks.

BAM! The door bursts open. Steve-O and Steve run in and grab
Peter Hammond, who screams. They drag him out of the room,
kicking and yelling. The EMPLOYEES all look around at each
other, Dalton re-enters the room.

DALTON (CONT’D)

Dalton extends his open palm and eyes the EMPLOYEES. DEXTER,

Daiton and White stare at each other for a tong moment.

DALTON (CONT ‘D)
Let me tel! you a story. During World War
Two there was an American working for a
bank in Switzertand. Now | don’t need to
tell you that when you lift up a rock,
you find a bunch of slime getting fucked
over by a Swiss banker. And I|‘ma thief.
They've been profiting off of the world’s
misery for centuries, and they're proud
of it. And certainly, this period in
history was rife with opportunity for
people of such tow morals. Peopte like
this one American. He used his position
to enrich himself while alt around him,
people were being stripped of everything
they owned, tortured, starved, murdered,
and burnt in ovens or buried alive. Then
he used some of his blood money to start
a bank. Now in the case of the Swiss,
hey, that’s just who they are. But the
idea that an American would do that,
collaborate with the enemy for financial
gain, that offends me personaily.

WHITE
So you're a patriotic bank robber .

wealth changes hands, books are opened.
Whatever. And things that were once dead

Miller and Dalton are speaking on the telephone. Mitler is
very upset at the turn of events. Dalton is naturally calm.

MILLER

DALTON

MILLER
My job is to make sure that everyone in
that bank gets out alive. Hopefully, that

MILLER (CONT ’D)
What are you doing?

They face each other through the locked glass door.

DALTON
You mean beyond the obvious?

MILLER
That's exactly what | mean. This ain’t no
bank robbery.

Dalton takes out a pack of chewing gum. He takes one.

DALTON
Why do you say that? Gum?

Dalton offers a stick of gum through the door frame.

MILLER
Because you're too damn smart for that.
That's why. You got every inch of this

I'm through buying into it. And no |

DALTON
You know, you're too smart to be a cop,

MILLER
Yeah, well we al! make our choices in

DALTON
We are all the sum of the choices we
make. And sometimes we choose the easy
path, and do things we regret. And when
you make a wrong choice, and do the wrong
thing, you're stuck with it forever.

MILLER
Who did the wrong you're here to right?

Oh, I’m not here to set anything right.

I'm here to get rich.

MILLER

Bullshit. What is it? Who's the bad guy?

DALTON
Wet!, 1’m just speaking hypothetically
here, but if you do something truly
immoral, that you know is wrong, well
then, you're stuck with that thing for
the rest of your life. And no matter how
many years you spend trying to make’ -
amends, doing good deeds, it doesn’t
erase the evil. You know what | mean?

MILLER
Sure. You do something wrong you gotta
pay the price. You gotta face justice.
Why don't you tell me who they are and
what they did, so | can make that happen.

DALTON

That's not what I’m saying. I'm saying
that an evil deed is it’s own punishment.
You don’t need to catch the guy and lock
him up. He's got a blemish on his soul
and he’s had to live with that his entire
life. In or out of jail - that’s just
housekeeping. In the end, we are the sum
of the things we do.

MILLER
That's reaily profound. By the way, have

We photographed everyone who came out of

them the photos. Most of them couldn't
point a finger at anyone. We asked them
who they could recognize as not being one

MILLER

Close. Getting stabbed in the back. The
hardest part is knowing that no matter
how many hours you put in, and how many
years, no matter how much of your heart
and soul you put into the job, you barely
make a difference. And the only real
respect you ever get out of it is from
other cops, because they know it’s a
thankless job. We cali ourselves the thin
btue line between the honest people and
the scum, but the truth is, the scum are
everywhere. And the good folk, they only
notice us when we fuck up.

satisfaction that comes with knowing that

dismantled in the supply room, with plaster behind it, giving
evidence of a hastily constructed facade.

pockets and places his badge, wallet, and gun on the dresser.
We see Katrine in the dresser mirror. Miller takes his keys

DALTON (V.0.)
