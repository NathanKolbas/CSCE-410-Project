Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 1.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY/NIGHT

It’s 1958. We’re in a lonely motel room.

A key hits the lock. A MAN throws open the door and races
into the room. He slams the door. He peeks out the window
and studies the parking lot.

He struggles to catch his breath.

We may notice blood on the sleeves of his suit.

This is FELIX O’ KELLY.

He steps away from the window. He’s carrying a RED DUFFEL
BAG. He sets it down and surveys his room.

CUT TO:
Felix shoves the bed to the side of the room.

[Note: for the duration of this sequence, the camera remains
in the same position. Fast jump cuts.]

Felix opens his red duffel bag. He removes a crowbar. A
hammer. A handgun.

CUT TO:

Felix, his jacket off now, yanks up the carpet from the
corner of the room, revealing the WOODEN FLOOR BOARDS below.

Felix looks at the floor boards. Looks at his tools.
Thinks.

CUT TO:
Felix adjusts THE RADIO antenna. Static. He fiddles with
the dial. Fifties folk-pop fills the room as Felix finds a
station playing “26 Miles” by The Four Preps.

Twenty-six miles across the sea, Santa Catalina is a-waiting
for me...

Felix turns up the volume.
CUT TO:

Felix hammers the crowbar between slats in the center of the
room. The sound is somewhat muffled by the radio.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

He pries up the floorboards one by one.

CUT TO:
Santa Catalina, the island of romance, romance, romance...
We may notice it’s NIGHT outside now. Felix has his
shirtsleeves rolled up. He’s covered in sweat. There’s now
a large hole in the floor. The floorboards are all neatly
stacked to the side.

Felix zips up the duffel bag. We never get a good look at
what’s inside.

He drops the bag inside the hole.
CUT TO:

Felix replaces the floor boards. He hammers the nails in
time to the music. He smokes while he works.

CUT TO:
Felix rolls the carpet back. Stamps it down in the corner.

He looks down at the hammer in his hand. Looks at the
crowbar on the bed. Thinks.

CUT TO:

The room is empty now. Through the open door, we can see
it’s raining outside. We hear a trunk SLAM.

CUT TO:
A soaking wet Felix crawls on his hands and knees and scoops
up the sawdust on the carpet. He stands. Surveys the room.
Looks good.

Felix catches a glimpse of himself in the LARGE MIRROR
mounted on the wall. Looks less good.

CUT TO:

Felix stands in front of his mirror. He combs his hair with
a black plastic comb.

Twenty-six miles across the sea...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED )

Felix paces back and forth. He stubs out one cigarette and
lights another.

CUT TO:

Felix sits in the wooden chair in the corner. He smokes.
The ashtray next to him is filled with butts.

HEADLIGHTS flare the curtains. Felix stubs out his
cigarette.

Forty kilometers in a leaky old boat...
There’s a knock at the door.

Felix grabs the handgun from the night stand. Moves to the
peephole. Studies the outside world.

Any old thing that'll stay afloat...
His shoulders relax when he sees who it is.

Felix throws the latch. Opens the door. Gestures for the
person to come on in...

BOOM. A shotgun BLAST hits Felix O’Kelly square in the back.
He’s launched clear across the room, and the second his body
SLAMS INTO CAMERA, blood splashing the lens --
CUT TO TITLE:

Bad Times At The El Royale
Over black. Title clears. A new song ("25 Miles”) signals a
new era. Driving sixties soul as Edwin Starr calls out, “All
right, feet, start moving..."
TITLE: Ten years later
EXT. EL ROYALE - DAY
The El Royale is a motor lodge nestled in the woods north of
Lake Tahoe. It once had dreams of being a mid-level vacation
hideaway. Those dreams do not appear to have been realized.

“You've got to get me there...”

A wooden arch bears the name of the establishment, welcomes
visitors to the mostly-empty parking lot.

A dented gray Studebaker drives through the arch.

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 4.
CONTINUED:

The defining characteristic of the parking lot is A RED LINE
that bisects the lot dead center and leads straight to the
double doors of the lobby lodge.

“It's twenty-five miles from home..."

The Studebaker parks. The driver opens her door. We get a
better look at her:

Late thirties. African-American. As she stares at the El
Royale, we can almost hear her thinking, “How in the Lord’s
name did I end up in this lonely place?”

This is DARLENE SWEET.

She opens her trunk and removes HER ODD BAGS. One is a large
flowered suitcase. The other appears to be an enormous roll
of fabric, bound with a rope around it.

It would be too much luggage for a lumberjack, let alone
Darlene. But she lifts the burden without complaint,
balancing one in each arm.

As she approaches the lodge, she notices A MAN standing in
the parking lot:

He’s in his sixties. He’s wearing a priest collar. He’s
staring at the hotel. He looks lost and confused.

This is FATHER DANIEL FLYNN.
Darlene slows when she sees him.

DARLENE
Are... you lost, Father?

Flynn almost jumps when he hears her. His eyes become clear
again, as though he just awoke from a dream. He smiles.

FATHER FLYNN
No. No, I suppose not.
(looks down)
According to this, I’m in Nevada.

ON THE GROUND: the RED LINE runs right between them. On the
west side of the line, stenciled letters read “California.”
On the east side of the line, “Nevada.”

DARLENE
(smiles )
I’ve never been to Nevada. What’s
it like?

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 5.
CONTINUED: (2) 2

FATHER FLYNN
Not bad. Looks like it might rain.
What’s California like?
Darlene looks over her shoulder to the west.

DARLENE
Still sunny.

Flynn picks up his valise.

FATHER FLYNN
Can I give you a hand there?

DARLENE
That's very kind of you, thank you.

She hands him the flowered suitcase. If Flynn is curious
about the strange roll of fabric in Darlene’s arms, he gives
no indication.

They walk towards the motel. The border leads straight to a
set of doors, one door on each side of the line.

They enter through the California side.
INT. LOUNGE - DAY

Ring-ring. The front door chimes as Darlene and Flynn enter
and study the unique accommodations:

The interior of the El Royale plays on the same border theme.
The line bisects the large room perfectly in two.

ON THE CALIFORNIA SIDE: everything is decorated in warm
orange hues. We may notice a bar, a set of tables, a lounge
seating area.

ON THE NEVADA SIDE: everything is decorated in cool purple
hues. We may notice the front desk, some gaming tables, a
black and white television currently showing coverage of
Richard Nixon’s 1969 inauguration speech.

At the back of the room, half in California and half in
Nevada, is a colorful JUKEBOX.

Flynn looks down at the border, Darlene follows his gaze.
They're both standing in California. Flynn gestures: be my
guest.

Darlene smiles. Takes a mock deep breath...

And steps across the border.

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 6.
CONTINUED:

FATHER FLYNN
How are you enjoying Nevada so far?

Darlene shrugs. So far, so good.

VOICE
Those are my accoutrements...

The voice has a thick Mississippi accent. It’s coming from
behind the bar on the California side. A man wearing a
charmingly rumpled seersucker suit reveals himself:

This is LARAMIE SEYMOUR SULLIVAN.

LARAMIE
(points)
At the front desk there.

They look to the front desk, where a large amount of luggage
has been piled.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)

That’s my trunk, that’s my
fortnighter, that’s my hat case.
And I’d ask that you folk respect
my claim when it comes time to
divvy the rooms. Though when
that'll be is anyone’s guess. I
been ringin’ that bell so long my
hand’s sore and my ears is tired
and my constitution needs coffee.
So. That’s why I’m back here
scroungin’.

He holds up a pack of coffee grounds. He dumps it into the
elaborate machine behind the counter.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
Success! Though I can’t say I
vouch for the quality.

He starts the machine. While it grinds and grumbles, Laramie
crosses the room, extends his hand to Flynn.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
Laramie Seymour Sullivan. Sales
manager, Calhoun Appliances. My
name may not be on the masthead,
but that don’t mean it ain’t a
family business.

He hands Flynn a business card. Tips his hat to Darlene.

(CONTINUED)
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 7.
CONTINUED: (2)

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
Ma’am.

DARLENE
Hello.

LARAMIE
What should I call you, Father?

FATHER FLYNN
Daniel Flynn. It is nice to meet
you.

LARAMIE
Father Flynn, huh. That’s easy to
remember, alliterative and such.
Whereabouts is your parish?

FATHER FLYNN
The Immaculate Heart of Mary’s in
Bloomington, Indiana.

A beat as Laramie sizes up Flynn.

LARAMIE

Well.

(then)
Let me just say up front that me
and the good people of East Biloxi
Baptist may have our differences
with your Pope, but in our hearts
we both believe in the divinity of
Jesus Christ, and that makes us
brothers as far as I’m concerned.
Who handles your hospitality at the
Heart of Mary?

FATHER FLYNN
I'm sorry?

LARAMIE
You know, who keeps the place clean
and tidy?

FATHER FLYNN
Her... name is Barbara.

LARAMIE
Could I trouble you for Barbara’s
phone number? I believe the good
Lord has put me in your path to
make her life easier.

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 8.
CONTINUED: (3) 3

Flynn studies Laramie. Thinks.

FATHER FLYNN
I confess my memory is not what it
used to be. But I have it written
down in my valise. I'd be happy to
get it for you once I check-in and
am squared away.

LARAMIE
I'd sure appreciate it. Though,
again, Lord only knows when that'd
be.

He points to the brass bell on the front desk.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
You can go ahead and give it a
whirl. I ain’t had much luck with
it.

(turns)
How ‘bout you, darlin’ -- you in
the hospitality business?

Darlene seems genuinely taken aback.

DARLENE
I -- how did you know my name?

LARAMIE
Your name is “Darlin’?” Ain’t that
a pip! And they say fate died in
‘63.

Darlene realizes the mistake.

DARLENE
Oh. Sorry. I thought you said...
never mind. I’m not in the
hospitality business. No.

LARAMIE
Well, I’1l give you my card
nonetheless. I’m sure you know
some gals who need a vacuum.
A beat. Then Father Flynn rings the bell.

The group waits in awkward silence. No response. Laramie
rolls his eyes: see what I mean?

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 9.
CONTINUED: (4) 3

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
This your first time at the El
Royale?

Both Flynn and Darlene nod. Laramie crosses back to the bar.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
It didn't always used to be like
this. And I don’t jus’ mean you
could find the clerk come check-in.
Naw, this place used to be hustlin’
and bustlin’. Tahoe’s best kept
secret. I mean, it was always a
novelty, but there’s state fair
novelty and old horse novelty and
we are now firmly in the old horse
variety.

He removes the coffee carafe from the machine and grabs three
cups. As he starts making his way back across the room:

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
‘66 this place had swing. Hell,
I’m sure I couldn’t get a main
lodge room if I tried.

He points to the photographs adorning the California wall.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
It was a hidey hole for the Tahoe
swells.

Darlene looks at the photos. The El Royale in more
boisterous times. There’s Frank Sinatra lounging by the
pool. There’s Martin Luther King, Jr. shaking hands with a
crowd of well-wishers. There’s Bobby Kennedy making pop-
superstar VESTA SHEARS laugh.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)

Dean Martin even sang a song about
it. “Half In California With
Judy?”

(off their looks)
No?

(shrugs)
Wasn’t one of his best. Coffee?

Flynn nods. Sure. Darlene shakes her head.

DARLENE
No, thank you.

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 10.
CONTINUED: (5)

LARAMIE
Aw, come on. I made a whole pot.
Can’t let it go to waste.

He hands her a cup. Take it. She relents.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)

(as he pours)
Atta girl. I'll let the clerk give
you the whole spiel, should he ever
show up, I mean. But the part they
tend to leave out is about, oh, a
year ago this place lost its
gambling license. Some problems
with the commission or something.
And so the swells took their
business elsewhere. Now the main
lodge is all that’s open and the
pool is filled with ducks and they
rent rooms by the hour if you ask
quiet-like.

(then)
‘Course, if we’re bein’ honest,
that’s probably why a priest, a
vacuum salesman, and a Negro can
afford freight here, right Father?

(laughs)
I’m just funnin’. My stay’s on
Calhoun Appliances, if I’m bein’
truthful, which is why room choice
is so important and I ask you to
respect my accoutrements there as a
proxy for my person. I intend to
lavish myself. Always wanted to
stay in The Honeymoon Suite.

He holds up his left hand. His ring finger is bare.
LARAMIE (CONT'D)
Though I am not currently on my
honeymoon.

They wait in awkward silence. They sip their coffee.

A light bulb goes off over Flynn's head. As though he’s been
thinking about something else this entire time:

FATHER FLYNN
Oh.
(turns)
“Darlene.”

Darlene nods. Smiles.

(CONTINUED)
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 11.
CONTINUED: (6) 3

FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D)
Nice to meet you, Darlene.

DARLENE
Nice to meet you too, Father.

LARAMIE
Well, hell. We have to wait much
longer, I might as well open up
that there trunk and set up the
Calhoun Electrovax. Give you folks
a proper demonstration. You sure
you ain’t in the hospitality
business, darlin’?

Darlene, once again, shakes her head.

DARLENE
No, sir. I am not.

She walks behind the front desk to THE DOOR that says
“Employees Only.” Gives it a proper thumping with her fist.
Wham wham wham.

There’s a THUD from behind the door.

LARAMIE
Ho! The lady’s got a luckier hand
than we do, Father. Shame these
here tables is decommissioned, we
could make ourselves some real
money.

We hear fumbling. Footsteps. The door finally swings open, 4
revealing a twenty-year-old kid with a baby face and an ill-
fitting desk clerk jacket. He looks a bit like a wet rat.

This is MILES MILLER.

MILES
I’m very sorry to keep you waiting.

If you had to guess how long it has been since Miles has last
slept, you'd probably go with “Five days.”

LARAMIE
Damn, boy, I been in this lobby so
long, I’m due for a shave. What's
wrong with you?

MILES
I'm very sorry.

(CONTINUED)
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 12.
CONTINUED:

Miles stops cold. If it’s possible for him to go paler, he
does when he sees Father Flynn.

MILES (CONT’D)
Wh... what are you doing here,
Father?

Flynn seems genuinely unsettled.

FATHER FLYNN
Do I know you, son?

MILES
No. But... I mean... this is not a
place for a priest, Father. You
shouldn’t be here.

LARAMIE
We may need to work on your sales
pitch, boy. “The El Royale: Ain't
No Place For A Priest.”

MILES
There are other hotels, Father.
Maybe closer to Tahoe? I could
help you find one, I’m sure you'd
be happier there.

Flynn recovers. Smiles a patronly smile. Looks at Miles’
name tag.

FATHER FLYNN
“Miles,” is it? If this is not a
place for a priest, Miles, then
this is exactly where the Lord
wants me.

LARAMIE
Well, the Lord don’t want you in
The Honeymoon Suite, I promise you
that much. Miles, those is my
accoutrements there, and I stake my
claim as such. But you can go
ahead and check them in first for
all I care.
(looks in mirror, rubs

chin)
Any luck I'll have a full Jeb
Stuart by the time we’re done.

Miles looks back and forth between Laramie and Flynn. He
continues to seem genuinely anxious.

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 13.
CONTINUED: (2)

FATHER FLYNN
It’s all right, son.

LARAMIE
Go ahead, boy. Give ‘em the spiel.
“The El Royale...”

MILES
The El Royale is a bi-state
establishment. You have the option
to stay in either the great state
of California OR the great state of
Nevada. Which would you prefer?

FATHER FLYNN
What’s the difference?

MILES
Between California and Nevada?

FATHER FLYNN
Between the rooms.

MILES
Well, for starters, rooms in
California cost a dollar more.

LARAMIE
(whistles)
Shoot. Really. When that happen?
What makes ‘em a dollar better?

MILES
They're in California.

LARAMIE
And that’s worth a dollar?

MILES
Some people think so.

LARAMIE
You got a number for those people?
‘Cause I got a vacuum they might be
interested in. Speaking of which!
Who’s your Head of Hospitality
here?

MILES
Currently that is also me.

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 14.
CONTINUED: (3)

LARAMIE
(grimaces)
Well. Then let’s worry about that
later then.

FATHER FLYNN
May I see a map of the hotel?

Miles nods. He pulls out A MAP. From above, the El Royale
looks like an upside-down “U” with the parking lot in the
middle. As Father Flynn looks it over --

MILES
Only the main lodge is available in
the off-season.
(then)
You can still use the California
amenities if you choose to stay in
Nevada.

LARAMIE
(chuffs)
What exactly is a “California
amenity?”

MILES
For instance, we are not allowed to
sell liquor in Nevada.

LARAMIE
Lost that when you lost your
gamblin’ license? So, you’re
saying, if we want to drink, we
gotta do it on this side of the
room?

MILES
That’s correct, sir. Also, coffee
is twenty-five cents a cup.

LARAMIE
Let me guess, you’re also the
bartender.

MILES
That’s correct, sir.

Laramie rolls his eyes. Removes a quarter from his pocket.

Slaps it on the desk next to Flynn, who seems genuinely
rattled by the map.

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 15.
CONTINUED: (4) 4

LARAMIE
Feel free to flip that if you need
to make a decision, Father.
Starting to cost me money waitin’
around here.

The quiet of the lobby is suddenly disturbed by the ROAR of
an engine from outside. All four people turn towards the
windows to see a GREEN DODGE CHARGER scream into the lot.

Tires SQUEAL as the Charger screeches to a stop.

Flynn turns his attention back to the map. Shakes his head.
Picks up Laramie’s quarter and flips it. Heads. Shrugs.

FATHER FLYNN
I‘1l take Room Four.

Miles looks away from the window. Gets a key from the wall
behind him.

Laramie moves closer to the window for a better look. IN THE
CAR: we can make out A WOMAN in the driver’s seat. She seems
to be watching the road behind her intently.

MILES
I‘1l need one night in advance.
Eight dollars. And twenty-five
cents for the coffee. Please sign
the ledger.

There’s a large leather ledger on the desk. Flynn takes out
$8.25 and puts it on the counter. Picks up the fountain pen.

CLOSE AS HE SIGNS: Father Daniel Flynn.

MILES (CONT’D)
Who’s next?

Laramie is still interested in the car outside. He gestures
to Darlene. Go ahead. She steps forward.

DARLENE
I'd like a room in Nevada, please.

Miles nods. Grabs a key. Slaps it on the desk.

MILES
Room Five.
DARLENE
(uncomfortable)
Oh.
(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 16.
CONTINUED: (5) 4

DARLENE (CONT'D)
(then)
Is there another room available,
possibly? Further away. Maybe at
the end?

OUTSIDE: the car door slams. The WOMAN starts walking
towards the lodge. She’s in a hurry.

Laramie turns his attention back to the desk.

MILES
These rooms have not been serviced
and are unsuitable.

LARAMIE
He does the housekeeping, remember.

MILES
There are rooms in California
available, ma’am.

LARAMIE
(losing patience)
She doesn’t want to be near the
priest.

Flynn, who was collecting his belongings and moving to exit,
stops in his tracks. I’m sorry?

LARAMIE (CONT'D)

(to Flynn)
Like we don’t see her walkin’ in
here with her own bedrolls under
her arms.

(to Darlene)
Don’t worry, darlin’, we ain’t here
to judge. Father here can even
teach you ‘bout Mary Magdalene and
forgiveness and what not.

Darlene’s eyes flash with embarrassment and anger.

Ring-ring. Right then, the woman from outside walks into the 5
El Royale.

She's in her late twenties. Looks to be a card-carrying
member of the flower generation. She’s trying her best not
to look distressed. And failing.

This is EMILY SUMMERSPRING.

Emily stops in her tracks, not expecting to find this many
people in the lobby. What did I just walk into?

(CONTINUED)
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 17.
CONTINUED:

Darlene turns her attention back to Miles, eager to get out
of there. She takes a small coin purse from her jacket and
counts out eight one-dollar bills.

DARLENE
Room Five will be fine.

MILES
Please sign the ledger. And it’s
twenty-five cents for the coffee.

Darlene’s eyes instinctively look to Laramie. He’s not
making eye contact.

DARLENE
(quietly)
Okay. Of course.

As she starts to reach for her coin purse. Clack. A hand
puts a quarter on the desk. Darlene sees it belongs to
Flynn. He nods. It’s on me. Darlene nods back. Thank you.
She grabs the pen.

CLOSE ON THE LEDGER as she writes: Darlene Sweet.

She grabs her bags.

FATHER FLYNN
Can I give you a hand to your room?

DARLENE
No.

She stops herself, realizing this man is not the one who
deserves her anger.

DARLENE (CONT'D)
Sorry, Father. That’s kind of you.
But I can manage from here.
Ring. Laramie makes a show of holding the door for her.
LARAMIE
(tips hat)

Ma’am.

Flynn waits a beat. Gathers his valise. Moves to leave.
Nods to Emily as he passes.

FLYNN
Afternoon.

(CONTINUED)
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 18.
CONTINUED: (2) 5

She gives him a curt nod. Ring. Flynn exits.

And then there were three. Miles looks to both of them.
Who's next? Laramie just shakes his head. Throws up his
hands.

LARAMIE
Please. Be my fuckin’ guest.
(yells to window)
Sorry, Father.

Emily shrugs. Fine. I'll go. Steps forward.

EMILY
I need a room.

MILES
The El Royale is a bi-state
establishment. You have the option
to choose a room in either --

She grabs the map from the desk. Studies it. Taps it.

EMILY
I‘1ll take that one.

Miles looks down at her choice. His shoulders slump just
slightly. His weary eyes look back to Laramie.

LARAMIE
Don’t fuckin’ tell me.

Emily removes a large wad of cash from her jeans.

EMILY
I‘1l take Room One.

LARAMIE
You can’t have Room One.

Emily turns and stares at him. Defiant. Why not?

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
Do you see my fortnighter right
there at your feet? Is this really
happening?

(to Miles)

Am I really about to explain the
concept of a free market claim
stake to the goddamn hippie?

Emily just stares at him with cold eyes.

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 19.
CONTINUED: (3)
Then she relents. Turns back to the map.

EMILY
Give me something along this wall.

MILES
The available rooms on that wall
have yet to be cleaned.

EMILY
I don’t give a shit. How much?

MILES
Eight dollars.

She peels off eight dollars. He puts a key on the desk.
Room Seven. She reaches for it. He slides it away.

MILES (CONT’D)
Please sign the ledger.

Emily stares at him. Really? He stares back. Yes.

She grabs the pen. Scrawls something fast. Grabs the key.
Heads towards the door. Ring.

LARAMIE
You have yourself a pleasant day,
now.

Laramie steps forward. Finally. He grabs the pen. Looks
down at the ledger. Sees Emily’s signature.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
Nice.

CLOSE ON THE LEDGER: Fuck You.
Laramie signs his name at the bottom of the page.

CLOSE ON THE LEDGER as he writes with flourish: Laramie
Seymour Sullivan.

CLOSE ON LARAMIE as he looks up at Miles and smiles.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
I‘1l take Room One.

CUT TO BLACK.

TITLE: Room One
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 20.

INT. ROOM ONE - DAY

We hear the sound of a key jangling. Click. Laramie enters,
hits the lights. He carries his accoutrements into the room.
Takes off his hat and jacket. Folds the jacket carefully and
lays it over the back of a chair. Rolls up his white shirt
sleeves. Studies the room.

The Honeymoon Suite is on the California side of the border,
and thus decorated in warm orange hues. It would never be
described as luxurious by any means, but it does have a
notable king bed on a raised platform and a jacuzzi tub in
the floor.

CLOSE SHOTS: locks flip. A suitcase swings open, revealing:
neatly folded clothes. Everything feels regimented. A hand
removes A DOPP KIT.

CLOSE SHOTS: items are placed along a sink. A toothbrush. A
soap case. A small bottle of shampoo. A hair tonic. All
meticulously ordered just so.

CLOSE SHOTS: locks flip. The trunk swings open, revealing:
the Calhoun Electrovax. The vacuum is removed. Click. A
false bottom is removed from the trunk. A BLACK BRIEFCASE is
removed and placed on the bed. The briefcase swings open,
revealing an array of SMALL TOOLS.

CLOSE SHOTS: a pair of glasses are removed from a case.

Laramie sits on the bed. In his shirtsleeves and wireframed
glasses now, he looks a far cry from the seersucker
southerner we met moments ago.

He removes a pair of pliers and a screwdriver from the case.

He thinks of something. He checks his watch. Does a small
double take. Picks up the phone and dials it. Listens.
Then.

LARAMIE
Hi, my love. I know, I know...
check-in took a little longer than
I expected...

And as Laramie talks, we may notice that his thick
Mississippi accent is now GONE.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
Is she still up?

(CONTINUED )
Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 21.

While Laramie waits, he takes the screwdriver and begins to
unscrew the baseplate of the phone receiver. He works
quickly, with clinical precision.

LARAMIE (CONT'D)
Hi rabbit! I know, I’m sorry. I
got delayed. Yes, the clock is
right. Daddy's wrong.

And between the accent, the wife, the child, and the toolkit,
it should obvious that this man has not been honest about who
he is. In fact, we should probably start calling him by his
real name. This is not Laramie Seymour Sullivan...

This is DWIGHT BROADBECK.

DWIGHT
But I got you before you went down.
Ready? Of course. I’m on my
knees.

Dwight pulls off the baseplate, flips the housing over.
Looks under the receiver...

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
“Now I lay me down to sleep, pray

Dwight removes a SMALL BLACK MICROPHONE from the receiver.
Holds it up to the light. Nods, pleased. He sets it down on
the night stand.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
“And if I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord --”

What do you mean we’re not saying
that anymore?

How do you even know what “morbid”
means -- what does Mommy want us to

say?
Dwight begins to reassemble the phone.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)

Okay. “When I wake in the morning
light --" Okay, okay, from the
beginning...

Dwight frowns. Something’s WRONG. He holds the receiver up
to the light to get a better look. Grabs his pliers.

“Now I lay me down to sleep, pray

Dwight removes something else from the phone with the pliers.
Holds it up to the light.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
“Teach me to do what’s right.”

It’s another microphone.

This one’s different than the other. Smaller. Tan in color.
Dwight stares at it, confused. Clearly troubled.
DWIGHT (CONT'D)
Amen.
(then)
I gotta go, Rabbit. Tell Mommy I
love her, okay?
(listens)
A couple days. I love you.

He hangs up. Places the tan bug on the night stand next to
the black bug. Stares at the two different microphones.

His eyes narrow. He looks to the rest of the room.

Dwight stands on the armchair. Unscrews the wall sconce.
Reaches behind the light with a pair of pliers.

CLOSE SHOT: an identical black bug is placed beside the
first.

Dwight pulls the light fixture from the wall. Frowns.
CLOSE SHOT: an identical tan bug is placed beside the first.

Dwight stands in the center of the room. Arms folded.
Staring at the night stand covered in surveillance bugs.
Deep in thought.

He shakes his head. None of this makes sense. He turns.
Something catches his attention. And the hair stands up on
the back of Dwight’s neck. We follow his gaze...

To the large MIRROR mounted on the back wall.

In the reflection, he can see a full view of the bed in the
center of the room.

Dwight stares at the mirror. Thinks.

EXT. EL ROYALE - DUSK

CLOSE: A brown shoe steps carefully through the pine twigs.

A second shoe steps directly in front of it, placing heel in
front of toe.

Dwight, still in shirtsleeves and glasses, walks carefully
along the east edge of the El Royale. Heel-to-toe. Heel-to-
toe. Heel-to-toe.

He's measuring the hotel.

Dwight reaches the corner. Folds his arms. Stares at the
hotel. Thinks.

INT. LOUNGE - DUSK

Ring-ring. Dwight steps into the lobby. Looks the place
over. It’s empty. The black and white television is still
on, casting flickering pale light all around the room.

ON THE TELEVISION: a SPECIAL NEWS REPORT breaks into the
Nixon coverage. We see shots of police cars outside a large
mansion. News logo reads: “Malibu Beach Massacre.”

Dwight opens the front desk drawer. Sees the room keys.
Spots THE MASTER. He takes it.

Dwight unlocks the door marked “Employees Only.” He eases
the door open...

INT. HALLWAY
Dwight steps into the narrow hallway. We can hear music
coming from somewhere. “Bend Me Shape Me” by The American

Breed. Dwight surveys. At the far end of the hallway,
there’s a HEAVY METAL DOOR.

Closer to Dwight, there’s another door with the words
“MAINTENANCE CLOSET.”

“Bend me shape me anyway you want me..."
INT. MAINTENANCE CLOSET 10

Dwight eases the door open, looks into the room. His face
falls. Reverse to reveal --

A cramped closet. A cot. A hot plate. A transistor radio.
And Miles. Passed out cold. Slumped against the wall. A
bent spoon on the floor beside him. A syringe still hanging
from his bloodied arm.

“As long as you love me, it's all right..."

Dwight closes the door.

INT. HALLWAY 11
Dwight approaches the HEAVY GRAY DOOR at the end of the
hallway. Tries the handle. It’s LOCKED. He tries THE

MASTER KEY. It doesn’t work.

Dwight reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a case of
LOCKPICKS. Drops to his knees. Works the lock.

Click.
INT. CORRIDOR - WEST 12

Dwight steps into a dimly-lit corridor. Shuts the door
behind him. Music stops. The world goes silent.

Dwight steps carefully down the corridor. At the end of the
corridor, the corridor branches. West or East. Dwight
chooses West. Careful not to make a sound. Rounds the
corner...

And finds the mirror. Or, rather, the OBSERVATION WINDOW. A
perfectly framed rectangle looking into a hotel room.
Specifically...

His hotel room.

He stares at Room One. Arms folded. Thinks. Looks down at
the feet. Takes note of THREE SCUFF MARKS on the floor.
13

Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 25.

INT. CORRIDOR - EAST 13
Dwight enters the East Corridor. Looking for something.
There. Way down at the other end of the hall. It looks
like...

A 16MM CAMERA. Mounted on a tripod.

[Note: from this point forward, this entire scene will be
done _in ONE CONTINUOUS TAKE. ]

 

Dwight starts walking down the hall. Passes ANOTHER
OBSERVATION WINDOW. The room’s dark. Dwight squints.

Seems empty. Dwight keeps moving. We track with him. Watch
him STOP SHORT when he gets to the next window.

Room Four.

As Dwight stares, we angle around to reveal: FATHER DANIEL
FLYNN. Unaware that he’s being watched, Father Flynn's busy
shoving his twin bed up against the wall. He reaches into
his valise, pulls out what looks like A CROWBAR and A HAMMER.
He goes to the corner of the room...

And starts yanking the carpet free of the tacks.

Dwight stares. The corridor eerily silent as the priest
works. Father Flynn yanks an entire swath of the carpet
free, exposing the old wood boards underneath.

Flynn takes the crowbar... and starts hammering it into the
floorboards.

Dwight can’t believe what he’s seeing. What the hell is this
old priest doing?

Dwight watches in silence for a second. Then turns his
attention back towards THAT CAMERA. Keeps moving. But stops
in his tracks yet again when he passes...

Room Five.

Darlene Sweet’s room. And, yes, there she is...

Also doing something strange.

She's standing on her dresser, trying to hang what looks like
a large swath of fabric on her west wall. She has thumbtacks

in her mouth, she uses them to secure the fabric in place.

She hops off the dresser. Grabs another roll. Goes back to
work hanging it on the wall.

(CONTINUED )
13

Bad Times At The El Royale Final Shooting Draft 26.
CONTINUED: 13

And she unrolls it, Dwight realizes this fabric is the
“bedding” Darlene was carrying earlier. It’s not bedding at
all...

It’s soundproofing foam.

Darlene fastens the last piece in place. Steps back and
surveys her handiwork. Her look seems to say: Well, it's not
great, but it'll do.

Darlene reaches into her bag. Removes A METRONOME. Sets it
on her table beside her. Sits down. Starts the metronome.
The pendulum rod starts to swing back and forth, but we can’t
hear anything.

Darlene closes her eyes. She takes a deep breath.

Her lips start to move.

It looks like she’s singing.

Dwight frowns. Looks down. Notices, there, below the
window...

A SPEAKER. And a SWITCH.
Dwight flips the switch. Darlene’s voice fills the corridor.
DARLENE

I try hard to hide, my hurt inside,

this ol’ heart of mine, always

keeps me crying...
Dwight jumps. The singing is LOUD. He half expects someone
else to hear him. Instinctively looks to the corridor.
Nobody’s coming. He turns his attention back to Darlene.
Her rendition of The Isley Brothers’ “This Old Heart of Mine”
is haunting. No music. Just HER VOICE and the click of the
metronome. Dwight watches. Transfixed.
Then, concerned, he walks back to...
Room Four.

And there’s Father Flynn. Standing waist deep in the
floorboards of his room. Perfectly still.

He’s staring at the wall next to him.
DARLENE (0.S.) (CONT’D)

Maybe it's my mistake to show this
love I feel inside...

Father Flynn slowly climbs out of his floor. Empty handed.
He walks to the wall. Puts his ear up against it. Listens.

Dwight walks back down the corridor.
Room Five.

Darlene’s belting it out now. Swaying in time to the music.
Clapping.

DARLENE (CONT'D)

‘But I... I love you. This ol’
heart... is weak for you.
Dwight stares for a moment longer. Then remembers... THAT

CAMERA. Starts moving down the hallway.
Room Six.

Empty.

Room Seven.

Also empty. But seems to be inhabited. There’s a bag on the
dresser. And ROPE. And A HUNTING KNIFE.

Dwight stops. Frowns. And just then...

Emily kicks open the door to Room Seven.

 

Dwight jumps. Surprised. Emily hurries into the room.
Dragging something heavy. It almost looks like A PERSON.

Emily kicks the door shut behind her. Carries her burden
RIGHT UP CLOSE to the observation window. Dumps it in A
CHAIR. It’s a person, all right...

This is ROSE.

She’s unconscious. Looks to be about eighteen years old.
Waifish. Half-dressed. She slumps forward, her head hits
the mirror. Thump.

Dwight instinctively edges backwards.

DARLENE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
This ol' heart of mine been broke a
thousand times, each time you break
away...

Emily stares at the unconscious body in the chair. Breathing

hard. She looks scared. She runs her hands though her hair.
The look on her face says what do I do next?

(CONTINUED )
13

She grabs the knife.

She grabs the rope.

She starts lashing Rose to the chair.

This all happens RIGHT UP CLOSE TO THE WINDOW. Emily cuts
the rope, ties Rose to the chair. Steps back. Thinks.
Grabs a bandana. Uses it to GAG Rose.

Rose never flutters. Out cold.

Dwight watches. Stunned. Can’t believe what he’s watching.
He tells himself to stay on task.

Keeps walking.

Room Eight.

End of the line. Empty. But the 16 MM Camera is there.
Mounted on the tripod. Dwight studies the camera. Opens the
case. It’s empty.

No film.

Dwight turns. Looks back down the hall from where he came.
Thinks. Then. Starts walking back.

Room Seven.

There’s Rose. Unconscious and bound. Right up close to the
glass. Dwight stops. Stares at her. Gets close to her.
Puts his hand on the window.

Keep moving, Dwight.

He starts back down the hall. Moving faster.

Room Five.

There’s Darlene. On her feet now. Swaying and clapping and
dancing.

DARLENE (CONT'D)

You_got me never knowing if I'm
coming or going but --

We see Darlene still singing. Dwight doesn’t break stride.

Dwight passes. Exits frame. We HOLD on the observation
window.

There’s Father Flynn. He’s taken a chair and placed it
against the wall he shares with Darlene’s room.

He sits with the back of his head against the wall. Looking
to the ceiling. Hands in his lap.

He listens to Darlene sing.
CUT TO:

EXT. EL ROYALE - PARKING LOT - DUSK 14

 

Dwight exits the lobby doors. Moving fast. With purpose.
Doesn’t even look up as the RUMBLE of THUNDER overhead
signals an incoming STORM.

He’s heading to the other side of the parking lot. Where a
lonely PAYPHONE stands beside the gate.

He grabs the phone. Dials a number from memory.

DWIGHT
Director's office. Case 246673.

Dwight waits. RUMBLE. That thunder clap makes Dwight look
up. Pat pat pat... The first drops of RAIN start to fall.

 

Dwight straightens up as a voice answers on the other end.
DWIGHT (CONT'D)

INT. STARDREAMS STUDIO - FLASHBACK 15

A genuine WALL OF SOUND hits us as we find ourselves moving
through a SIXTIES RECORDING STUDIO in full swing:

There’s the LIVE BAND. The DRUMMER snapping the snare. The
PIANIST tapping out that iconic rhythm. The SAX PLAYER
waiting to come on in...

Over there... in the isolation booth... there’s the lead
singer. Her name is VESTA SHEARS. She’s in her early
twenties, and in six months Dick Clark is gonna call her “the
future of pop music” on live television.

But for now, she’s singing her heart out while THE MEN BEHIND
THE GLASS watch.

VESTA SHEARS
My he holds his head up high when
he goes walking by-y-y-y...

We keep moving through the studio... There’s THE THREE BACKUP
SINGERS. We’re moving down the line of them as they sing
their parts. All wearing bright, colorful dresses. All
sporting bouffant hairdos.

BACKUP SINGERS
Qo0000.... OOO00O...

And THERE... at the end of the backup trio, is a face we
recognize...

There’s DARLENE SWEET.

She looks at least ten years younger, even though the reality
is only half that. She’s wearing a green dress. Her eyes
are closed. Lost in the music. Smiling bright as she belts
it out:

DARLENE
He's a rebel and he'll never ever
be... any good...

There, watching her through the window, that’s British
wunderkind producer BUDDY SUNDAY himself. He’s dressed in
his standard Savile Row suit and scarf.

His arms are crossed. He’s glowering. Staring right at

Darlene. Even though she’s only the third backup singer in
this whole elaborate affair.

The other singers give Darlene sympathetic looks.

The musicians file out of the studio as Buddy enters.

Darlene watches as he stops Vesta before she leaves. He cups
her cheek. Tender. Nurturing. We can barely make out their
conversation:

BUDDY
«--no, no, you were brilliant.
This is why I have you tracked
solo.

VESTA SHEARS
I can come in stronger...

BUDDY

I don't want you thinking, pet. I
want you to stay in this --

(waves his hand over her

body )

And let me worry about the knobs
and dials. Okay? Now. Get some
air. This'll be but a minute.

Vesta exits. Leaving Darlene alone with Buddy.

Buddy approaches. His eyes go cold as he studies Darlene.
Lights a cigarette.

BUDDY (CONT'D)
Where were you last night?

I’m very sorry. I wasn’t feeling

He said he would give you the

So I could be fresh today.

BUDDY
Is that your assessment of your
performance thus far? “Fresh?”

DARLENE
I... I don’t know, sir.

BUDDY
I told you, please, call me Buddy.
Or Mr. Sunday, if you must. But
never Mr. Buddy. Impossible not to
make that sound patronizing.
Sounds like a chocolate bar. Do
you know how much my time is worth,
Darlene?

DARLENE
No, sir. Mr. Sunday.

BUDDY
Columbia Records does.

He points to the paperwork he has spread out on the mix
console.

BUDDY (CONT'D)
Columbia Records currently values
my time at two hundred dollars an
hour. Are you currently ina
position where you can turn down
two... four... six hundred dollars
when it is offered to you?

No. I am not.

BUDDY
Six hundred dollars of my time.
But, instead, you wanted to stay

flat on the intro and sharp on the
harmonies.

DARLENE
Twelve dollars a session.

No matter how long the session.
Which, I suppose, means the longer
I keep you, the less your time is
worth.

He offers her a cigarette. She politely declines.

BUDDY (CONT'D)
You have a choice here, Darlene.
Give me one year of your time. And
I can make you a star. You’ll be
singing lead. You'll be staying at
The Carlyle. You'll be headlining
the Riviera. Or. You can continue
to treat my time as disposable.
And you can keep scrounging for
twelve dollar backup gigs until
they dry up. And in five years
you'll find yourself shuffling

She looks at her luggage. Her suitcase is open. Something
catches her eye. She reaches in, pulls out HER SHOW DRESS.
Holds it up. She notices the seam is split.

Her shoulders slump. This will have to be sewn.

We get the sense this happens a lot.

There’s a KNOCK at the door.

Darlene jumps in surprise. Who could that be? She frowns.

DARLENE
Yes?

FATHER FLYNN (THOUGH DOOR)
Hello, Darlene? It’s Father Flynn.
From earlier.

She leaves the chain intact. Opens the door. Father Flynn
looks at her through the crack. Behind him, the rain is
beginning to pour.

DARLENE
I’m so sorry. I was making too
much noise, wasn’t I?

FATHER FLYNN
No, no. Not at all...

DARLENE
I have a show tomorrow, and I have

So you've really never heard of The

Sandwiches, fruit, pastries. Everything looks gray.

me in the parking lot, today,
actually. I had completely
forgotten where I was. What I was
doing. It’s the strangest feeling.
You look around and you’re someone
else. And you don’t know who that

is.
DARLENE
Father... can I say something?
(then)
It sounds like you should see a
doctor.
FATHER FLYNN
I did.

He agrees with my assessment that
it’s not just age.

I'm very sorry.

He smiles a kindly smile.

FATHER FLYNN
I wasn’t looking for pity. Might
be for the best, in fact. Some
parts of my life aren’t worth
remembering. No, I’m just telling
you because, if I seem scattered...
I don’t mean offense.

She pats his hand.

DARLENE
None taken.

Flynn finishes his drink. Exhales.

FATHER FLYNN
I could use another.

He stands up. Makes his way back to the bar. She gets up,
too. Carries their dirty plates over to the bar.

FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D)
Sure I can’t tempt you? My memory
may be spotty, but I do recall it’s
a sin to let an old priest drink
alone.

DARLENE
Okay, sure. One drink.

FATHER FLYNN
Grand.

Darlene walks back over to the jukebox.
CLOSE SHOTS: Flynn pours two drinks.

Flynn glances up at Darlene. Confirms she’s not looking at
him. She’s lost in the music.

And in this moment, as he stares at Darlene, Father Flynn’s
face changes. The kindly old priest disappears. And is
replaced by a different man.

A much harder man.

Father Flynn reaches into his jacket and removes a small
glass vial. He pours a clear liquid into Darlene’s drink.

 

Darlene doesn’t see any of this happen.

DARLENE
(back turned)
Don’t push your luck, Father. But.
If you happen to find yourself in
Reno tomorrow... I go on at six.

FATHER FLYNN
I'd like that.

HOLD ON FLYNN. His face drifts again. As though he’s
forgotten, once again, where he is.

Or.
Perhaps he’s having second thoughts about what he’s about to
do. He repeats the words to himself, as though he’s
realizing he really means them:
FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D)
(quietly)
I'd like that.

But. Then. His face hardens with resolve. He picks up the
glasses. He turns around...

FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D)
But until then --

And Darlene bashes him in the face with a wine bottle.

 

CRASH! The bottle SHATTERS. Blood and glass flies
everywhere. Father Daniel Flynn goes down in a wet heap.

Darlene stares down at his unconscious body. On the jukebox
we hear Levi Stubbs scream out:

It's Rose.

She's wearing cowboy boots and jeans.

She sits in the sand with her knees to her chest.
She's crying.

A BAREFOOT MAN walks along the boot prints. Theirs are the
only footprints on the beach.

BAREFOOT MAN
Hi.

Rose looks up and squints. The man is BACKLIT by the setting
California sun. We never get a good look at his face.

back towards Rose...

And Dwight kicks in the door.

Wham! The door hits Emily -- she spins to fire -- but before
she can, Dwight BACKHANDS her with the butt of his gun. She
goes down hard, between the two beds. Her gun goes
skittering across the floor.

Dwight puts his foot on Emily’s gun. Kicks it into the
bathroom. Keeps his gun trained on Emily.

But she’s unconscious. Not moving.
Rose CRIES OUT beneath her gag.
Dwight hurries over to her.

Dwight’s body hits the ground in a bloody mess.

Rose stares down at his dead body. Curious. Surprisingly
calm for what’s just transpired.

Emily struggles to catch her breath. Struggles to process
what the fuck just happened. She lowers the shotgun. Looks
to the dead body. Looks to her sister.

And then she looks to where the mirror used to be.

The car’s dead. No. She tries again. Click. And again.
Click. Nothing.

And all the fear and panic that Darlene’s been keeping at
bay, it all comes home. She starts pounding at the steering
wheel... No no no no NO...

Hold it together, Darlene.

She grips the steering wheel tight. What do I do what do I
do? She closes her eyes. Tries to keep her voice calm.

DARLENE
(quietly)
Dear Lord, please give me guidance.
I am here in darkness and I need
your light.

She sees something outside.

It’s Dwight again.

He’s left his room. He’s heading towards Room Seven.

Now what?

Darlene watches from the covered darkness of her car: Dwight
knocks on the door. Dwight seems to be having a conversation
with the person inside. Dwight seems to be getting
frustrated. Dwight steps away from the door.

Dwight pulls HIS GUN out of his coat.

Darlene’s eyes go wide as Dwight steps quickly to the door
and KICKS IT OPEN. Darlene JUMPS -- oh my god -- as Dwight
disappears into the room.

Darlene opens her door. Moving on instinct -- through the
rain -- staying covered. Trying to get a better look at
what's happening inside that room.

There's Dwight, cutting Rose free. There's Emily getting to
her feet. With a shotgun. Before Darlene can scream --

BOOM. Emily shoots Dwight.

Darlene claps her hands over her mouth to stifle her scream.
Oh god NO.

Darlene’s POV: Emily and Rose look at each other in shock.

Look to the shattered window. Emily steps forward.
Cautious. She pokes her head through the hole.

EMILY
Jesus Fucking Christ!

The storm around Darlene makes it hard to hear exactly what’s
being said in the room. We hear distant screaming. Words
come through muffled.

EMILY (CONT'D)
What is this?

(then)
Keep your fucking hands where I can
see them! What the hell is this?

Emily thinks. Looks to Rose.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Rosie. Stay right there.

ROSE
Okay.

Emily takes the shotgun, clears the remaining glass on the
edge of the window.

She CLIMBS THROUGH the hole, keeping her gun trained on the
ground below.

Then she disappears.
EMILY (0.S.)
I said keep your hands where I can
see them!

HOLD ON DARLENE. Crouched in the pouring rain. Watching
these strange horrors unfold:

Rose steps forward. Looks through the hole in the window.
Huh. A curious child.

Then Rose turns away. Surveys the room. Something catches
her attention...

The telephone.
INT. ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT 39

In the room now. We can hear things much clearer. Emily
YELLING. Miles SCREAMING.

MILES (0.S.) EMILY (0.S.)

Rose picks up the phone. Glances back towards THE HOLE. No
sign of Emily. She dials a number from memory.

Listens. When she hears the voice on the other end, her face
LIGHTS UP with happiness. Speaks quietly:

ROSE (INTO PHONE)
Hi! It’s me.

(listens)
I don’t know. I’m with Em. She
had me all tied up. I think she
shot a cop.

EMILY (0.S.)
What is this place?

ROSE (INTO PHONE)
We're in a hotel. I don’t know.

(smiles bright)
You will? Okay, let me look...

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 40
Darlene watches Rose talk on the phone. Can’t quite make out
what she’s saying. Sees Rose start to open drawers. Looking
for something...

INT. ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT 41
Rose holds up A MATCHBOOK.

ROSE (INTO PHONE)
It says “El Royale.”

EMILY (0.S.)
Rosie -- c'mon --

ROSE (INTO PHONE)
I gotta go.

(smiles)
Okay. See you soon.

Rose hangs up. She walks back across the room. Looks down
at Dwight’s lifeless body. Huh.

EMILY (0.S.)
Get up! MOVE.

We hear Miles CRY OUT in pain.

Rose hops up on the window. Slips through the hole into the
darkness.

What the hell are you doing back

HOLD on the empty room as the sounds of Emily, Miles, and
Rose recede.

Camera drifts back towards THE FRONT DOOR. Rain and
lightning and thunder.

Darlene’s head peeks into the room.

She steps forward tentatively, eyes on that window, ready to
bolt at the first sign of movement.

She creeps into the room.

Heart pounding. Keep it together, Darlene. Eyes LOCKED on
that window.

She slides up next to Dwight’s dead body. Starts patting his
bloodied chest. Where is it? Where is it?

There.

She reaches into his jacket. Eyes still watching that
window. Pulls out...

The distributor coil cable.
Actually, to be precise, she pulls out three distributor coil

cables. And they’re all bloodied. And they look like
they've been chewed with buckshot.

 

Darlene’s heart falls. Panic takes hold once again. Not
right now, Darlene.

Her eyes glance down to Dwight’s face. His glassy, empty
eyes stare up at her.

Get moving, Darlene.
She starts to head back the way she came. But then she

stops. Sees something across the room. There. On the
floor...

Dwight’s gun.

Darlene grabs it. Bolts from the room.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 42

Darlene pops the hood of her Studebaker. Stares at the
engine. Looks at the bloodied cables in her hands.

What do I do with these?

She searches for where they might fit. Her hands shake.
It’s dark. She can barely see the engine, let alone discern
where the cable might go.

She makes her best guess. Tries to lock one of the cables in
place. She closes the hood.

INT. STUDEBAKER - NIGHT 43

Darlene gets in her car. Shuts the door. Her hands fumble
for her keys. C’mom... c'mon...

She puts the key in the ignition. Take a breath. Please.
Darlene turns the key.
The engine groans. But doesn’t turn over.

She grips the steering wheel so tight her knuckles turn
white.

DARLENE
(closes her eyes)
Lord...
There’s a KNOCK at the passenger’s side window.

Darlene CRIES OUT in surprise. She reaches into her coat,
pulls out the gun, points it RIGHT AT --

Father Flynn.

He’s at the passenger window. Holding both hands where
Darlene can see them. Don’t shoot. I mean no harm.

He gestures for Darlene to roll down the window.
After a moment, she does. Never taking the gun off him.

FATHER FLYNN
I just want to talk. Can I get in?

Darlene thinks about it for a moment.

DARLENE
I will shoot you in the face.

He doesn’t wait for further invitation. He opens the door.
Sits down in the passenger seat slowwwwwwly.

He rolls up the window.
He wipes the rain from his forehead.
He stares at the hotel.

FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D)
Well.
(then)
We're in a bit of a pickle here.

Darlene just stares at him. Tries to keep the gun from
shaking as she points it right at him.

FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D)

I’m sorry I tried to drug you back
there in the lobby.

(then)
I wasn’t trying to diddle you or
nothing like that. I just needed
to break into your room and I
didn’t want to hurt you. More than
need be, I mean.

(then)
No hard feelings about bashing me
in the head, is what I’m saying.

Flynn stares at the hotel. Thinks.
FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D)
I'm pretty sure those girls just
killed a cop of some sort.
DARLENE
(nods )
They did.

FATHER FLYNN
You saw it?

Darlene nods.

FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D)

She nods again. Flynn thinks.

No shit.

CUT TO BLACK.
TITLE: Room Four

We HEAR what sounds like sleigh bells jingling. And is that
some sort of Christmas music in the distance?

INT./EXT. ARMORED CAR - DAY 44

SAME FRAMING. CLOSE ON the man we know as Father Flynn. At
least, we think that’s him... it’s hard to know for sure
beneath that BLACK HAT and MASK he’s wearing. We should
probably start calling this man by his real name now:

 

This is DOCK O’KELLY.

We start slowly tracking back... ROTATING as we do so... Dock
seems to be frantically shoving CASH into a familiar RED BAG.

Cash seems to flip and flutter in the air around us... we
keep pulling back... snowflakes drift in among the cash...

Dock turns, climbs towards us, and we reveal we are in:

1958. Small town, main street U.S.A. Christmas time.
Festive lights frame the folksy storefronts. Decorations and
snowdrifts line the streets. And right in the middle of it
all...

A horrible car accident. AN ARMORED CAR has been flipped
completely upside down by a black Chevy truck.

It’s chaos. Smoke billows from the cars. Cash and snow
drift through the air. Dock climbs out of the back of the
car, moving fast, shotgun in one hand, red bag in the other.

He looks to LARSEN ROGERS, who is similarly dressed in a

suit, hat, and mask. Larsen is crouched down, looking at the
TWO UNCONSCIOUS GUARDS near the wreckage.

DOCK
Are they dead?

LARSEN
They’11 live.

DOCK
(angry)
Where'd you learn to drive?

LARSEN
They swerved.

DOCK
They tend to do that when you’re
box sweepin’ ‘em --

LARSEN
“Stay on his fender.” That’s what
you said. “I want ‘em scared.”
DOCK
Scared. Not... comatose.
LARSEN
(sheepish)

Comas are scary.

SCRREECH. A ROARING BUICK tears around the corner, expertly
swerving to a stop in the middle of the action.

The third member of the team hops out of the car...
FELIX O’KELLY.
Dock's brother.

The same man we saw at the beginning of the film.

 

He surveys the wreckage. Steps towards Larsen. Angry.

FELIX
Are they dead?

LARSEN
Okay...

FELIX

Where'd you learn to drive?

LARSEN
We've been over this --

Shut _your fucking mouth. Get the
money. Not one more word.

Larsen begrudgingly starts scooping up what loose money he
can from the ground.

DOCK (CONT'D)
(to Felix)
They ain’t dead.

FELIX
Praise the Lord. We can’t leave
this here...

Felix hops behind the wheel of the wrecked Chevy. Turns it
over. The engine groans and rumbles... but it starts. Felix
slams it into reverse, pulling it free from the armored car.

He backs up a few feet, right next to Dock. The two men
listen to the clanking engine.

DOCK
Will it run?

Felix just shrugs. Who the fuck knows? They stare at Larsen
as he scoops up the money.

FELIX
Think the kid’s bent or just
stupid?

DOCK

I’m going with stupid but I’m
willing to be persuaded.

ACROSS THE WAY: ONLOOKERS peek out from a CHRISTMAS TREE LOT.
DOCK (CONT'D)
Hang on, I better scatter these
kids...

Dock steps towards the Christmas trees. He RACKS the shotgun
and yells at two children:

DOCK (CONT'D)
This’1l cut_your little legs off at
the fucking kneecaps!

The kids run. Dock turns back to Felix.

FELIX
You're starting to sound like Mom.

Thinking. Then.

DOCK
Get out of the car, Felix.

Dock opens the door. Hands Felix the RED BAG.
DOCK (CONT'D)
Take the kid. Ditch the Buick at
Rocklin and split up. I’11 lead
them south and burn this once I’m
clear.
(then)
We'll meet at the El Royale.

There’s a moment as these two brothers stand in the center of
the storm. Snow drifts down as they lock eyes.

DOCK (CONT'D)
Felix...

Dock glances at Larsen.

DOCK (CONT'D)
Play it close.

Felix nods. Dock slides behind the wheel of the truck.

FELIX
You sure about this?

and tie as he stands up next to his lawyer and awaits his
sentence.

JUDGE
Donald O’Kelly. On the charges of
grand larceny and conspiracy to
commit larceny, I hereby sentence
you to fifteen years in the federal

Pre-lap the sounds of A MAN SCREAMING...

INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT 46
SAME FRAMING. Though now Dock’s lying on his back. And he
looks a decade older. His wild, terrified eyes look up at us

as he thrashes about in his bunk.

DOCK
Where am I where am I where am I?

His CELLMATE is a large, tattooed man named SAMMY WILDS. He
tries to roust Dock from what seems like a waking nightmare.

SAMMY
Dock, Dock -- stop -- hey -- HEY --
You're okay --

Dock sits up. Stares at his cramped cell. Confused.
Terrified. Gasping for air. A frightened child.

DOCK
Where am I?

SAMMY
Same place you’ve been for the last
ten fucking years. Cell Block
Four. Just breathe... you’re

Sammy’s voice seems to be calming Dock down. We get the

DR. WILLIAM LAURENCE studies the X-Ray. Takes a drag off his
cigarette.

Dock sits in a prison hospital bed. He’s wearing his prison
clothes. One hand is handcuffed to the bed rail. He’s gota
black eye and a bandaged forehead.

DOCK
What do you think?

DR. LAURENCE
I think you should stop fighting
with the niggers, for starters.

DOCK
Mexicans. This time. And I didn’t
do nothing.

DR. LAURENCE
I'd hate to see what it looks like
when you do something. They tell
me that boy down the hall may not

SAME FRAMING. Dock sits in the passenger seat. Stares out

DOCK
Ten years ago, my brother Felix and
I robbed an armored car in
Sacramento. Job went bad. I think

Bury the money in the floor of the

I couldn’t remember what room we
said. Either four or five. It was
true what I said back there about
my mind not being what it was. I
guessed wrong. So. I think
there’s a whole mess of money
buried in your room.

(then)
And I need your help to get it.

They sit in silence for a bit. The rain pours down.
DARLENE
And you expect me to believe all
that.

Dock considers her question.

DOCK
Um. Well. It’s the truth. So
there’s that. But... no. I get
it.

How’d you know I wasn’t on the up-
and-up in the first place?

DARLENE

You spend your life gettin’ shook,
you learn to spot a shaker.

Dock nods. Likes the way that sounds.

DOCK
Is that from a song?

I suppose I’d do the same if I was

DARLENE
And now? What would you do if you
was me?

Dock thinks about it.

DOCK
I guess my first instinct would be
to shoot this old man in the face
and clear out of Dodge.

DARLENE
You're dead right so far.

DOCK

But then I'd think that through.
The cars don’t work, and this storm
isn’t letting up. How far am I
getting on foot tonight? People
are gonna come looking for that
dead cop soon enough. And I sure
don’t want to be the black woman in
the woods with the gun when they
do.

(beat)
So. Then I start thinking about my
other options. I suppose I could
walk back in there and take my
chances with those kids...

DARLENE
I promise you I ain’t thinking
that.

DOCK

Which leads me to option three.
Maybe I hear this old man out.
Maybe he’s telling the truth.
Maybe he can help me.

(then)
Maybe there really is money in my
room. And maybe this old man...
maybe he doesn’t have a lot of time
left. And he’s fine with fifty
percent of whatever we find in that
floor.

HOLD ON DARLENE. Staring at Dock.

If I’m right... I can walk out of

life forever.

Darlene stares at Dock O'Kelly. Seeing him for who he is.
Seeing what he’s offering.

She thinks.

She glances at The El Royale.

How much money we talking about
exactly?

Rose stands motionless in the dead center of the room.
Staring UP. It’s unclear why.

After a moment, she exits frame... and returns with a CHAIR.
She seems to be building something.

Her movement carries us over to Emily, who has tied up Miles
in a chair across the room. She sits down across from him.
Looks him in the eye.

EMILY
So what is this? Some sort of

Miles is in rough shape. His face peppered with buckshot and
glass. He’s whimpering. She slaps him out of it.

She looks over his wounds. Brushes some of the larger chunks
of glass away.

I honestly can’t remember what you

fact that things have changed.

I saw a man lay with a wolf once.
Guy drags a full grown, feral wolf
on a choke-chain into his room.
Ties it up to the bed. Then takes
off all his clothes, climbs in bed
beside it, and holds the thing all
night. Like, it wasn’t sexual, but
it wasn’t not sexual, either.

Guy just lay there crying. Saying
“Help me” while he held that wolf.
All night.

I never told nobody ‘bout none of

Rose catches hold of THE CHANDELIER. She swings back and
forth with glee, like a child at the playground.

The light in the room swings back and forth, back and

Emily stares at Rose. JI can't even deal with this shit right

Miles watches Rose swing.

Rose seems unfazed. She pulls a log out of the fireplace and
uses it to light the braziers around the room.

In the darkness behind Emily, the shadows MOVE...

EXT. ROOM FIVE - NIGHT 63
Darlene and Dock slip out of Room Five. Darlene holds the
gun, Dock holds the bag. They keep their eyes locked on THE
LOBBY as they creep towards the parking lot.

They give each other a look. We did it.

Darlene motions for Dock to wait. She creeps forward, stares
at the front windows of the lobby. It’s DARK. Why's it so
dark? She waits as the sound of thunder crashes around them.
We can feel Darlene’s heart pounding. Something is wrong...
but, if we're gonna move, we better move now. Darlene turns

to Dock... let's go...

And_a_man has a knife at Dock’s throat.

 

Darlene’s eyes go wide with shock. She starts to raise the
gun... a hand whips out of the shadows behind her, grabs her
arm, puts a knife to Darlene’s throat...

It all happens FAST in the flashing tempest of the storm.
“Twelve-Thirty” by The Mamas & the Papas starts to play.

I used to live in New York City... Everything there was dark
and dirty...

A MAN approaches.

He’s walking towards them though the deluge. As the
lightning FLASHES, we catch glimpses of THIS MAN:

He’s young. Late-twenties, if we’d had to guess. He's
wearing a white shirt, open all the way to his navel.

Darlene and Dock lock eyes. Stare at this approaching
figure.

Outside my window, there's a steeple...

The man stops as he nears. Lifts his face to the rain.
Bathes in the storm as though it was a warm shower.

With a clock that always reads twelve-thirty...
The man smiles. The music SWELLS to CRESCENDO.

A nude man runs through the field, cutting the frame.
“And in the mornings I can see them walking..."
We finally get a good look at HIS FACE.
This is BILLY LEE.
As he walks through the field of wildflowers, we can see a

back there.
Billy Lee leads them through the yellow. Feels the sun.

You don’t get to be part of the
family just ‘cause you’re kin. Why
do you want to be here?

EMILY
Rosie says you treat her good. I
‘ppreciate that.

They come upon a large, gnarled oak. Billy Lee sizes it up,
starts climbing it. Emily watches.

BILLY LEE

That's the second time you brought
up your sister when I was askin’
‘bout you. Don’t worry about
Rosie. Rosie’s right where she
needs to be.

You comin’ up?

Emily stays right where she is.

EMILY
I’m fine.

Billy Lee leaps from bough to branch to bough with relative
ease. Clearly at home up in the treetops.

BILLY LEE
Don’t get me wrong. I know what
you've done for your sister. She’d
still be in that house in Alabama
without you. So thank you.
Sincerely. For sendin’ her our

Emily with flourish.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
Poof!

The leaves flutter all around Emily.

The leaves settle. Billy Lee looks down at Emily with THOSE

Would you know God if he was

Maybe it’s all lies.

He turns his attention back to the crowd. Warm again.

I honestly don’t know the answer.
Part of me thinks that if I just

insightful. Is it working? Give
it a second.

Everyone laughs. They're all enraptured by him.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
I ain’t saying I got it all figured

They define right and wrong and

Up/Down. Good/Evil. Right/Wrong.

He chooses another girl.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
And Millie, why don’t you join us,

tonight.

The crowd cheers, excited.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
Been a while since we’ve had a
tussle, right? Oh, but Rosie don’t
want to tussle, right? She’s smart
enough to know not to play the
game, right? But this is how I get
her. I dangle something she really
wants. You two are gonna have a
proper tussle tonight. And the
winner... well, the winner gets to
sleep in the big house with me
tonight. How’d that be?

And from the looks on both Rose and Millie’s faces, it’s

The girls nod. They size each other up and down. Billy

girls and Emily.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
You girls make sure you stop when I
tell you to stop. Not like last

All right, then. Have at it.

The girls charge each other. It happens fast. They SLAM

violent.

Emily steps forward to help her sister.
But Billy Lee steps right in her way.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
Easy, Emily. She’s a big girl.

ON THE GROUND. Rose spits blood as Millie cracks her.

Emily steps forward, but Billy Lee flashes her a look that
says don't you fucking dare.

Rose lets out a primal scream and head-butts Millie in the

Across the room, Rose looks up from the film.
Emily stares at Billy Lee. Then she shakes her head.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
Well that’s not hardly nice. I’m
offering you a chance here on
account of the fact that we’re
practically family. That’s
downright charitable of me,
considering.

Boots, you hear what your sister's
doing?

Rose looks at Emily with sad eyes.

ROSE
Emily... if Billy Lee’s offering
you a chance... you should take it.

Billy Lee smiles. Nods. Locks those eyes on Emily.

BILLY LEE

Did you really think you could take
what’s mine and I wouldn’t come a-

She ain’t yours.

BILLY LEE

We used to raise goats out on the
farm. Boer goats, ‘cause you can
breed ‘em year round. Bucks are
ready to go once they’re about
seven weeks old. Seven weeks!

(looks to Wade)
Can you imagine? Think of
something that happened to you
seven weeks ago. If you were a
baby then, you’d be fucking now.

(then)
‘Cause you’re male, I mean. The
does take about eight months ‘fore
they’re much use. And you learn.
When you got a litter, you learn to
separate the females before those
bucks come ruttin’. ‘Cause once
those does go into heat... they’1l
kill each other. I seen it over
and over. They’1ll bash each others
heads until their brains spill out
in the dirt. Happens with mothers-—
daughters, too. Something about
the blood, I guess. But it ain’t
like the sisters.

(then)
Ain’t nothing as violent as
sisters.

He finishes his drink.

EMILY
(quietly)
None of that is true.

Billy Lee looks at her. I’m sorry?

EMILY (CONT'D)
There wasn’t no violence ‘til you.

BILLY LEE
Maybe. Maybe not. But it’s there
now, though, isn’t it?

Billy Lee looks mildly surprised. Good. He gives Annabell a

BILLY LEE
Well then I guess that makes you
black, alter boy.

And Billy Lee spins the roulette ball.

 

Everyone TENSES as they realize what’s happening. The ball
whips around the wheel. Wade and Annabell lean in with their
guns. Their eyes saying stay in your fucking seats.

Miles coughs beneath his gag. Billy Lee takes pity on him.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
You got some prayers, you can say

Billy Lee pulls down Miles’ gag.

Kid, you don’t shut the fuck up,

Miles quiets down. Rose puts the glass on the table. Billy
Lee pours Dock a drink.

Dock’s hands are tied behind his back. He doesn’t know what
to do. Rose looks at Billy Lee. You want me to untie him?

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
No. His hands stay tied.

Billy Lee picks up the drink. Holds it to Dock’s lips. Dock
drinks.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
Where’s the money from?

I stole it from a bank about a
decade ago. I hid it here, but got
myself caught by the cops. Did
some time. Got out a few days ago.
Came back tonight to retrieve it.

And he says it real matter-of-fact. So much so, it takes
Billy Lee a second to absorb it. Then he laughs.

Dock nods.

Billy Lee breaks Darlene’s gaze. The violence in his eyes
vanishes as quickly as it appeared. He throws a patronizing
shrug Darlene’s way --

BILLY LEE
You go right ahead.

And turns his attention back to Dock.

BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
Why didn’t you just leave when you

Dock considers.

Ido. Yes.

DOCK

Do you give yourself to the mercy

of the Lord?

MILES
Yes.

DOCK
Will you give to Him the time you
have left?

MILES
I’m too late.

DOCK
It is never too late, my son.

MILES

Yes. I will try. I will try to be
better. I will try to be a better
man.
(then)

I repent. Father Flynn, I repent.

(coughs blood)
Lord, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

Dock takes his hand, places it on Miles’ chest. Holds his
gaze. Shh.

DOCK
You are forgiven.

Miles begins to relax as soon as he hears those words.
DOCK (CONT'D)
Miles Miller. In the name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit... you are forgiven.

Miles nods. His eyes drift to the middle distance. At
peace, finally.

He dies in Dock’s arms.

A moment. Dock and Darlene share a look. Dock lays Miles’
body down gently to the ground. Darlene closes his eyes.

Dock and Darlene stand. 84
They look around. The flames are now crawling the walls.

Smoke billows through the room. They glance at each other.

A silent agreement. They spring to action.

They both scoop up what cash they can.

They stuff it into the red bag.

Time to go.

As they’re leaving, Dock sees THE FILM CAN.

He picks it up.

Thinks.

Hands it to Darlene.

She stares at it for a moment.
Then she throws it into the fire.

WHUMP. We’re CLOSE on the film reel as it burns and twists
and smokes in the heat.

Somebody tosses THE LEDGER PAGE on top of it as well. We see
the names, underlit by the flames: Laramie Seymour
Sullivan... Fuck You... Darlene Sweet... Father Daniel
Flynn...
Dock and Darlene head for the door.
HOLD ON THE PAPER. The names burst into flame.
WIDE ON THE ROOM. As flames devour the El Royale, Dock opens
the Nevada door for Darlene. We see the first rays of dawn
on the horizon.
Ring-ring.

CUT TO BLACK.
TITLE: Reno 85

OVER BLACK, we hear the sounds of a not-so-bustling keno
parlor. People talking, slot machines ringing...

We hear the voice of MILTON WYRICK, our emcee for the
evening...

MILTON (0.S.)
Folks, I feel like we’ve got a
genuine Humdinger Jackpot in here
tonight, I really do...

TITLE: Humdinger Lounge
MILTON (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Last time I felt this way, we gave
away a brand new, candy-apple red
Chrysler De Soto to a lovely couple
from St. Paul, Minnesota.

Bill and Elaine... McIntyre, I want
to say. Good people. Could be
you. Here we go...

TITLE: Wednesday
INT. HUMDINGER LOUNGE - NIGHT

We're FOLLOWING A MAN as he walks through the Humdinger
Lounge, Reno’s sixth-best combination dinner lounge and keno
parlor. We hear the sound of the emcee calling to us from
another room:

MILTON (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Seven, nine, sixteen, thirty-one,
forty-two, forty-seven, sixty-
three, seventy-six, and... eighty.

The man makes his way through the smoke-filled rows of people
playing slots. He’s heading towards the back lounge, where a
group of musicians are setting up on a small corner stage.

The man stops at the threshold.

He rubs his hands on his pants. As though he’s not quite
sure what to do.

He looks for a seat in the lounge. (There are plenty
available.)

MILTON (ONSTAGE) (CONT'D)
If you hit, come see the cashier so
we can get you down before the next
draw.

The man sits down.
We see his face.
It’s Dock.

MILTON (CONT'D)

Now, we've got a special treat for
you tonight. Coming to you all the
way from beautiful Los Angeles,
California. You’ve heard her sing
on records with artists such as The
Crystals, Martha Reeves, The
Marvelettes, Wilson Pickett, and
The Miracles. Ladies and
gentlemen, let’s give a warm, Reno
welcome to... Darlene Sweet!

Darlene steps on stage to a scattering of applause. We may
notice she has a brand new dress.

She nods hello to her band for the evening. Hi boys. She
looks to the audience.

DARLENE
Thank y’all for coming out to
listen to me tonight.

A moment. As she stands in the light. Grateful for her
life.

DARLENE (CONT'D)
It means the world.

She sees Dock. Sitting alone in the back of the room. She
almost seems surprised to see him. It’s you.

He nods hello.
She smiles. Hello, Dock.
Then. Back to business.
Two, three, four...
Darlene grabs the microphone.
CUT TO BLACK.
The End
OVER CREDITS: Darlene Sweet and her backup band level the 6
p.m. Wednesday crowd at the Humdinger Lounge with an
absolutely blistering cover of Sam & Dave’s “Hold On, I’m
Coming.”
Don't you ever be sad...
Lean on me, when times are bad...

Just hold on.

I'm coming.
