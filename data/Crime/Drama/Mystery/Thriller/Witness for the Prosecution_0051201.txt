WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION

COURTROOM NO. 1 - THE OLD BAILEY

A.marder trial 1s about to begin. The venerable chamber
of British justice is filled. The participents for the
Prosecution and Defense are in their pleces. So is the
jury. So are the spectators. Only the Prisoner's Dock
and raised seats of the Judge and city dignitaries are
still vacant. Three knocks from a wooden mallet are heard.
An usher rises and calls out, "SILENCE!" Everyone stands.
& door opens and the Judicial procession solemnly enters:
the Sheriff, the City Marshal, .the Mace-Bearer, the
Sword-Bearer, the Lord Mayor, and finally, the Judge. All
in full regalia.

The usher beneath the witness box, delivers the opening
proclamation:

USHER
SILENCE! BE UPSTANDING IN COURT!
ALL PERSONS WHO HAVE ANYTHING
FURTHER TO DO BEFORE MY LORDS
THE QUEEN'S JUSTICES OF OYER AND
TERMINER AND GENERAL GAOL
DELIVERY FOR THE JURISDICTION OF
THE GENERAL CRIMINAL COURT DRAW
NEAR AND GIVE YOUR ATTENTION.
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN! .

The CAMERA has begun to move in slowly on the bench. As
the dignitaries take their pleces we superimpose the
CREDIT TITIZS. The Sword-Rearer affixes the Sword, point
upmost, above the centrel chsir, The Judge bows first

to the Jury, then to the Ber, finally to those with him on
the Bench. He sits. Everybody fol3ows suit. The trial
hes begun.

Meanwhile, the CAMERA has moved in on the gleaming sword
and holds there until the last of the Credits FADES OUT:

LONDON SQUARE (Day)

A bobby, framed very large 4n the foreground, is
directing traffic. Among the moving cars, quite
conspicuous, is a vintage high-bodied Rolis Royce.

INT, OF ROLLS-ROYCE (DAY)

A vintage chauffeur is @riving. In the back
seat are SIR WILFRID ROBARTS and his’ nurse,

MISS PLIMSOLL. Sir Wilfrid is sixty, pele, ill-
tempered. A lap robe is tucked around his legs.
He has been quite ill. That accounts for the
uniformed nurse, Miss Plimsoll: she is forty-
five, brisk, unbearebly chatty.

What a beautiful dey! I've
‘been hoping thet we'd have
a bit of sun for our home-
coming. I elways say it's
worth having all the fog
just to appreciate the
sunshine. Is there too
mach of a draught? Shall I
roll up the window?

SIR WILFRID

Just roll up your mouth, You

talk too mch. If I'd known

how much you talked I would

never have come out of my coma.
(pushing down ~.
the lap-robe)

Tis thing welghs a ton.

MISS PLIMSOLL
Now, now -- we've been flat on
our back for two months -- we'd
petter be careful!

She has pulled up the robe and tries to tuck him in
again. He slaps her hand.

fhe Porter at the gate recognizes the Rolls, salutes
Sir Wilfrid and waves the car through.

The Rolls proceeds through the Square. It is all
very sedate: the old buildings wearing ivy and
some barristers wearing robes and wigs.

Lovely! It must be perfectly
lovely to live and work in the
Inns of Court. How lucky you
lawyers are!

SIR WILFRID
He certainly was a lucky lawyer!

Ext, SIR WILFRID'S BUILDING (DAY)

The Rolls pulls up before a dignified corner puilding’
occupied by many barristers. The chauffeur jumps out,
opens the door. Miss Plimsoll emerges, holds out 4
helping hand to Sir Wilfrid.

MISS PLIMSOLL
Teeny-weeny steps, now Sir ~
Wilfrid. We must remember -- we
hed a teeny-weeny heart attack.

SIR WILFRID
(ignoring her hand)
Shut up!

Williams, my cane.

Williams hands him an invalid's cane, with-subber tip.
He starts briskly for the stone steps leading to the
entrance. In background, Williams is taking luggage
from the boot.

THE ANTEROOM OF SIR WILFRID'S CHAMBERS (DAY)

A serious room. The decor’ is old and oaky. So are
the three female employees, Miss McHugh, Miss Johnson
and Miss O'Brien. Doors lead to Sir Wilfridts private
office and to the offices of his clerk and juniors.

A staircase rises to the floor above, where Sir
Wilfrid's living quarters are situated. -

Miss Johnson hes been leaning out the window. She
turns back into the room, excited.

MISS JOHNSON
Here he comes!

There 1s instant activity. Miss O'Brien rings a
handbell.. CARTER, Sir Wilfrid's elderly clerk,
rushes out from his own room. A charwoman comes
down the staircase. Miss McHugh has taken
a bouquet of flowers from a file cabinet. They line
up in a rehearsed formation, facing the door. Sir

Wilfrid enters rapidly, followed by Miss Plimsoll
and Williams.

SIR WILFRID
Good afternoon.

He proceeds toward his office, ignoring the
reception line-up. In passing he whisks the
flowers from Miss McHugh's hand.

STR WILFRID
Thank you very mch, Everybody
back to work.

MISS MCHUGH
Sir Wilfrid, please -- if you
dontt mind -- I would like to
read a little poem which we have ~
composed to welcome you <=

She has whipped out a long sheet of legal-size paper,
typewritten on both sides.
SIR WILERID
(interrupting) :
Very touching, Miss McHugh. You
can recite it after office hours,
on your own time. Now back to work.

He starts for his room, sees Miss O'Brien sobbing, her
cheeks streaked with tears.

SIR. WILFRID
What's the matter with you?

He goes on into his office, followed by Carter. .

Int. SIR WILFRID'S PRIVATE OFFICE DAY

A large, somber room of faded elegance. On one wall is
a painting of Sir Wilfrid in wig and gown, Sir Wilfrid
enters, puts a monocle suspended from a black ribbon

in his eye, and looks about. Behind him, Carter closes

the padded door.

SIR WILFRID “
Look at this room! it's really
extraordinarily ugly! Very old ,

SIR WILFRID
A lift! Whet nonsense! I'm getting
a bit sick of this plot to make me a
helpless invelid.

MISS PLIMSOLL
I think it's a splendid idea, Let's
try it, shall we?

She is about to plant herself on the seat when Sir
Wilfrid shoulders her aside.

SIR WILFRID ~
I'll try 1t. It is my lift, be-
‘Cause it wes my heart attack.

<_ He waves her away, then settles himself in the seat.

Simply press this putton for up,
and this one for down,

SIR WILFRID

(pressing the white

button) —
Carter, I warn you, if this contrap-
tion should collapse -- if the
barrister should fall off the
banister -- -.
He is already sailing up, Miss Plimsoll trotting after
him. He arrives at the top of the stairs, beaming.

This is remarkable, Carter.

years.

Before she can stop him, he has pressed the button and
sails down egain.

Prom the bottom of the staircase, Carter is watching his
master's enjoyment of the new toy. The door behind him
opens and two visitors enter the law offices, They are
MR. MAYHEW, e man of Sir Wilfrid's age, a respectable
London solicitor from his high collar to the tip of his
tightly rolled umbrella. ‘The other man is LEONARD VOLE:
young, attrective, wearing a sports coat and slecks.-- ~
quite out of place in this stronghold of the bowler hat,
the brief case and the striped pants.

CLOSER SHOT

Mayhew is about to speak to 4 typist, then sees Carter.
He gestures to Vole to wait. Vole lights a cigarette
while Meyhew walks up to Carter.

MAYHEW
Good afternoon, Carter, Would
it be possible to see Sir Wilfrid?
Itm sorry I didn't ring up for an
appointment, but this is urgent.

CARTER ~
If it's about 2 brief, Mr. Mayhew,
I'm sorry, but we're full up. Sir
Wilfrid hes all thet he can handle.

MAYHEW
I'm sure he'll want this brief -
(nodding toward Vole
and lowering his voice)
-~ Serious criminal matter.

The typists look up at Vole, eyeing him curiously.
He smiles uncomfortably in return..

CARTER .
Absolutely not, Mr. Mayhew,
(behind him, Sir
Wilfrid slides into
SHOT. in the inclin-
ator)
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.
He cannot possibly accept anything
of an overstimieting nature. .

Hello, Wilfrid, This is very dis-

MAYHEW
If you could give us just a few
mimites. My client is right here.

This is Mr. Leonard Vole. He's
in rather a ghastly mess, I'm

afraid,
‘SIR WILFRID
How do you do, Mr. Vole.

Well, according to Mr. Mayhew, I'm
not doing at ail welll

For an instant Wilfrid looks at him with interest.

at the top of the stairs an impatient Miss Plimsoll
claps her hands..

MISS PLIMSOLL

Sir Wilfrid! You're dawdling again!

SIR WILFRID

(right back at her)
Shut up! -

Sorry, Mayhew. ‘Try me again some
day, when you have something not

He has pressed the button and is going up’ again.
Suddenly, 2s he is looking down at Meyhew, his

. attention is Grawn to something. He puts the
monocie in his eye for a better view.

It 4s two cigers protruding from Mayhew's breast pocket.

Mayhew and Vole have turned to go. They turn back. Sir
Wilfrid has come down on the inclinator and jumps up from
the seat.

SIR WILFRID
Come back here, Mayhew}

. * CARTER
Sir Wilfrid, please -~

SIR WILFRID

Don't worry, Carter, we won't take
the brief. But Mr. Mayhew 4s an
old friend and he needs help.
Surely, if I can give him a word
of advice --~- :

(he has opened the

door to his own office

“and beckons)
Come in, I'll give you five minutes.

MAYHEW
That's very kind of you, Wilfrid.

He and Vole are about to follow Sir Wilfrid into his
office.

SIR WILFRID

4nto the room)

Miss Plimsoll, out of breath, runs down the stairs and
up to Sir Wilfrid.

Mr. Mayhew thinks it's very urgent -
he thinks I may be srrested at any
minute.

MIss PLIMSOLL
Arrested for what?

"VOLE"
Well -- for mrder.

He smiles engagingly. They stare at him, trying to
reconcile his ost ettractive appearance with what he
has just told them,

INT. SIR WILFRID'S OFFICE DAY

Mayhew is seated in one of the visitor's chairs, relating
the cage. Sir Wilfrid is circling him like a bird dog,
his eyes: glued to the cigars in Mayhew's pocket.

MAYHEW
-- it's the case of Mrs. Emily French.
You have probably seen the reports in
the Press. She was a middle-aged
widow, rather well-off, living with a
housekeeper in Hampstead. Mr. Vole
had been with her earlier in the even-
ing. When the housekeeper returned
from her day off at eleven P.M. she
found her mistress dead -- struck on
the back of the head and killed.

SIR WILFRID

is on the cigars)

in a web of circumstantial evidence -~

VOLE

I haven't murdered anybody.

om It's absurd. But Christine --

¢ that's my wife -- she thinks I
may be implicated and that I
needed a lawyer. So I went to
see Mr. Mayhew and now he thinks
thet he needs a lawyer. So now
I have two lawyers. Silly,
isn't 1t?

. MAYHEW
Mr. Vole, I am a solicitor.
Sir Wilfrid is 4 barrister.
Only a berrister can actually
plead a case in court. ~.

Sir Wilfrid is completely sbsorbed in his cigar, on
which an inch of ash has now appeared. He bends back,
opening a small drawer in an old file cabinet behind hin,
He drops the ash there, then closes the drawer.

SIR WILFRID

satisfaction)
She shall not even find the
. ashes.

VOLE

(easily)
Well, I saw in the papers that
poor Mrs. French had been found
dead, with her head bashed in --
and then 1¢ said in the papers
that the police were anxious to
interview me since I had visited
Mrs. French that evening -- so
naturally, I went along to the
police station.

SIR WILFRID
(interrupting; sharply)
Did they caution you?

VOLE
I don't quite know. I mean,
they asked if I would like to
make a statement and they would
write it down, and it might be
used against me in Court.

\ (with a shrug)
iWould that be cautioning me?

STR
(with a sigh)
Gh, well, 1t can't be helped now.

: VOLE
Anyway, they were very polite and
they seemed quite satisfied.

MAYHEW -

They seemed satisfied, Mr. Vole.
“(to Sir Wilfrid)

He thinks thet he made a

statement and that's the end ~

of it.

(back to Vole)
Mr. Vole, isn't it obvious to
you that you will be regarded
as the principal and logical
suspect in this case? I have
great fear that you will be
arrested.

: VOLE

I've done nothing. Why should
I be arrested? I mean, this is
England. You don't get arrested
or convicted for something you
haventt done?
~

‘Yo

SIR WILFRID
We try not to make a habit of it.

VOLE
But it does happen, doesn't it?
Of course, There was that case
of what's-his name -~ Adolph
Beck, or Becker - he'd been
in jeil for eight years when
they found out it was another
chap entirely -- he was innocent -
all along.

SIR WILFRID
Very unfortunate. But restitution
has been made. He received =
free pardon, 2 bounty from the
Crown, and was restored to his
normal life.

VOLE
(quite agitated)
Yes, that was all right for him.
But whet if it had been murder?
-- what if he had been hanged?
=-- how would they restore him
to his normal life then?

MAYHEW
Really, Mr. Vole, you mstn't
take such a morbid point of view.

VOLE
(a little embarrassed)
Sorry. It's just that when
you tell me it's all closing
in on me -- It's like a
nightmare.

. MAYHEW
Relax, Mr. Vole. I am putting
you in the hands of the finest ~
and. most experienced barrister
in London --

SIR WIIFRID

Now, Mayhew, let's get this straight.
I may have done something highly
unethical: I've taken your cigar
and I'm not taking your case, I
cantt, I'm forbidden. My doctors
would never allow it.

(to Vole)
I'm truly sorry, young man.

‘(and to Mayhew again)
However, 1f you would like the case

Sir Wilfrid has risen and crosses to the door. In passing

he shoves his cigar in Vole's hand.

SIR WILFRID
Hold this.

He opens the door into the anteroom.

I haven't had a job in four

months.
: SIR WILFRID
What sort of work do you do?
VOLE

Well, my last job was as a
mechanic with ea motor servicing
firm. The foreman kept riding
me all the time. I took it as
long es I could, then I quit.

SIR WILFRID
And before that?

VOLE
I was working in 2 department -
store -- in the toys, demonstrating
children's building sets. Of course,
that only lasted through the
Christmas rush. Before that, I
worked in a petrol station, but

Very annoying. .

Before that, I had a job testing

You mst be thinking I'm a bit
of a drifter, sir. It's true, in
a way, but I'm not really like
that. Doing my Army service
unsettled me a bit. That
and being abroad. I was
stationed in Germany. It was
fine there. That's where
I met Christine, my wife. She
was an ectress, and a good one.
Shets been a wonderful wife to
me, too, but I haven't been mech

I could just put my egg-beater

- Yes, sir. I'm sort of an -

inventor ~~ nothing big, just
little household things. A
pocket pencil sharpener, a key~

is really this egg-beater.— You

money for manufacturing and promotion-

hoping Mrs. French might do for me
after I met her.

SIR WILFRID _
Oh, Exactly how did you meet this
Mrs. French?

VOLE
That was rather funny in itself --
it was the third of September -- I
remember distinctly because 1t is
my wife's birthday -~ I was window
shopping on Oxford Street, sort of
daydreaming about what I would buy
for her -- if I had any money --

INSTANT CUT TO:

EXT. MILLINERY SHOP OXFORD STREET TAY

Vole strolls by the shop, stops and looks at a display
of silly hats in the window. He looks casually into the
shop and. sees a middle-aged Jady, neat and prim -- MRS.
EMILY FRENCH. The salesgirl is just putting a small,
conservative hat on Mrs. French. She studies herself in
the mirror. Suddenly she is aware that Vole is looking at
her. She turns toward him. Vole shakes his head in
disapproval. She accepts his decision, tries on a second
hat, looks again toward Vole for his opinion. Ail she
gets is a "not good, not bad" sort of look. She discards
the hat, tries on a third one. This is a wide-brimmed

- affair, quite wild. ‘She looks expectantly at.Vole. He

likes this one and nods his approval. She looks again
at the mirror, then rushes out of the shop to talk to him,

MRS. FRENCH

SIR WILFRID

Your line of defense, however, will
be lack of motive. You will agree
that we can rule out a crime of
passion. That leaves us with a
murder for profit. Now then -- if
Mr. Vole. had been sponging on Mrs.
French, why kill her and cut off
the source of supply? Or -- if he

kill the goose before it vas laid?

No motive. No motive whetsoever!

Don't be afraid, Sir Wilfrid. I

SIR WILFRID
There is nothing to be alarmed about
as yet ---
CHRISTINE

Teonard has been arrested and charged .
with marder -- is that 1t?

(sir Wilfrid nods soberly)
I knew he would be. I told him so.

SIR WILFRID
I'm glad you're showing such
fortitude...

CHRISTINE
Call it what you lfke.. What is
the next step?

SIR WILFRID

Your husband will have to stand
trial, I'm afraid..

(to Brogan-Moore)
Will you take Mrs. Vole inside
and explain the procedure.

(to Christine)
Mr. Brogan-Moore will lead the
defense.

yo

CHRISTINE
Oh? You will not personally defend
Teonard?

SIR WIEERID
Regrettably, not. My health -- or
rather the lack of it -- forbids me.
CHRISTINE ~
It is regrettable. Mr. Mayhew
described you as the champion of
the hopeless cause.

She hss followed Brogan-Moore to the door of Sir Wilfrid's
office. Stops, and turns back.

CHRISTINE
Is it perhaps that this cause is

2 . too hopeless?

She does not wait for an answer, walks into the office
and” Brogan-Mbore closes the door.

 
4h,

25. Sir Wilfrid lets the monocle fall, seats himself on the
. inelinator and presses the button, 111 the time glaring
‘ro at the closed door of his office. The inclinator rises,
‘ and Miss Plimsoll trots beside it.

MISS PLIMSOLL
I shall have 2 very serious talk
with Dr. Herrison. It was a
mistake to let you come back here. -
I should have taken you directly
to a rest home, or to a resort --
some place quiet, far off --
like Bermuda.

SIR WILFRID
(his mind on
Mrs. Vole)
Oh, shut up! You just want to
see me in those nasty shorts.

The inclinator comes to a stop at the head of the staircase.
Miss Plimsoll helps Sir Wilfrid up from the seat. He stands
still, looking down toward his office door.

MISS PLIMSOLL
(plucking at his

She leads him into the bedroom.

26. SIR WILFRID'S BEDROOM (TAY)

It is the room sbove his office, of the seme shape and
the same octagonal vimiow design. There is a big
Victorian bed, e chaise, deep comfortable chairs, and

& washstand behind a folding screen. As they enter, Miss
Plimsoll takes. a pair of pajamas from the bed and hands
them to Sir Wilfrid.

~ ‘MISS PLIMSOLL
Now put those on -- tops and
bottoms -- while I make your

Behind the screen Sir Wilfrid hasn't made 4 move to get into
the pajamas. His body is here; his mind is in the office
below.
MISS PLIMSOLL
(ousy with the bed)
I mst say, I feel sorry for that
nice Mr. Vole -- not just because
he was arrested -- but that wife
of his -- she mst be German --
I suppose that's what happens
when we let our boys cross the
channel: they go crazy --~
Personally, I think the Government
should do something about those
foreign wives -- like an embergo --
how else can we take care of our
own surplus -- don’t you agree,
Sir. Wilfrid?
(the bed is ready)
All right, hop in -- :

Alarmed, she looks behind the screen. The pajamas are
there, but no Sir Wilfrid. She runs oute.

Too late. She gets a last glimpse of Sir Wilfrid entering
his office.

INT. STR WILFRID'S OFFICE (MY)

Brogan-Moore is interviewing Mrs. Vole. He is seated
‘behing the desk. Mrs. Vole is in a chair near the
window. She is very calm and poised. Sir Wilfrid enters
quietly, gestures to Brogan-Moore to contime, then moves
to a position from which he can observe Mrs. Vole.
o

CHRISTINE
Yes, of course, I knew that Leonard
had been seeing Mrs, French quite
frequently. I knew it from the day
when he came home with a pair of
green socks she had knitted for him.

BROGAN-MOORE
Well, that's quite natural. And
I'm sure a jury will fine 1t
rather endearing.

CHRISTINE
Oh, LIeonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of
green, and the socks were two
sizes too small, but he wore them
just the same --just to.give her
pleasure. Leonard has a way with
women, I only hope he will have
an all-woman jury -- they will
carry him from the courtroom in
triumph!

BROGAN-MOORE
A simple acquittal will do. Now,
Mrs. Vole, you know that Mrs.
Prench left your husband money?

. CHRISTINE
Yes. A lot of money.

BROGAN-MOORE
of course, your husband had no
previous knowledge of this
bequest?

CHRISTINE
Is that what he told you?

: BROGA N-MOORE
Surely, Mrs. Vole, you are not
suggesting anything different?

CHRISTINE
Oh, no. I do not suggest anything.

BROGAN-MDORE
Quite obviously, Mrs. French had
come to look upon your husband
as a son -- or, perhaps, & we
favorite nephew.

Mrs. Vole, you realize that your

accused of murder when supported
only by the word of his wife.

Brogan-Moore smiles slightly. Sir Wilfrid, his face now

SIR WILFRID
My dear Mrs. Vole -- in our Courts
we will accept the evidence of
witnesses who speak only Bulgarian,
and who must have an interpreter; and
even desf-mutes,who cannot spesk at
all. As long as they tell the truth.

Leonard came home at precisely

and nothing but the truth. Is that
better?

SIR WILFRID
Mra. Vole, do you love your husband?

CHRISTINE
Teonard thinks I do.

SIR WILFRID
(angrily)
Well, do you?

CHRISTINE
Am I already under oath?

SIR WILFRID .
Mra. Vole, whatever your gambit
may be, do you know that under
British law you cannot be called
to give testimony damaging to your
husbend?

CHRISTINE
How very convenient.

SIR WILFRID
We are dealing with a capital
crime. The prosecution will try
to hang your husband!

CHRISTINE
He is not my husband.

-Moore and Sir Wilfrid stare at each other, then
at her. There is a moment of shocked silence.

CHRISTINE
We went through a form of marriage
in Hamburg, but I had a husbend
living at the time somewhere in
Bast Germany -- in the Russian

SIR WILFRID

It would have been stupid to teil
him. He would not have married
me and I would have been left
behind to starve in the rubble.

So he married you, and brought

you safely to this country. Dontt

you think you should be very grateful .

(ecidly)
Thank you for coming in, Mrs.
Vole. Your visit has been most
reassuring.

CHRISTINE,

(1m the doorway)
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. T
shall give him an alibi. I will
be very convincing, There will
be tears in my eyes when I say --
Leonard came home at nine twenty-
six -- precisely. I may even
bring the cuckoo - as an additional

witness. —

SIR WILFRID
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mra. Vole.

She exits.

SIR WILFRID
I'm damned if I'm satisfied.

BROGAN-MOORE

The Prosecution will break her
down in no time when I put her
in the witness box.

(while Sir Wilfrid 1s

looking out the window)
You know, defending this case is
going to be rather like The

INSTANT CUT TOs

EXT. BOMBED-OUT STREET IN HAMBURG ( NIGHT)

The street is wet from rain. Flight Sgt. Leonard Vole,
in Royal Air Force uniform, 4 small kit-bag slung over
his shoulder, comes down the street. He stops in the
cellar doorwey of one of the bombed-out buildings. A
sign over the door, with a blue lantern attached, reads:
DIE BLAUE IATERNE. Next to the door is a provocative
poster of an entertainer exhibithg her remarkable
gartered legs. Across the poster is printed:

CHRISTINE HELM. Music from a small band drifts from

the shabby cellar cabaret and Christine is heard singing.

It 1s one of those fly-by-night cabarets which spring
up in the rubble to attract servicemen.

Vole glances at the poster, then goes down the shattered
steps leading into the night club.

INE, NIGHT CLUB (NIGHT)

Vole enters the dark smoke-filled roam and looks around,

It is a smAll claustrophobic catacomb with odds and ends
holding the crumbling walls together, It is packed with
British military personnel. The air is hot and thick
with pent-up animal expectancy.

On an ersatz stage an emaciated four-piece German band
is accompanying Christine. She wears a German sailor's
outfit, with pants. She sings AUF DER REEPERBAHN and
accompanies herself.on a small accordion,

-Vole crosses to the bar, where it is already three-deep,
buys himself a schnapps and watches Chris tine.

Christine starts the second chorus. She steps down
from the stage. As she plays and sings, she moves
alluringly between the densely crowded tables, brushing
against the eager, alcholized customers. A rickety
spotlight, operated by one of the waiters, follows her.

There are scattered catcalls and whistles of Siseppointment
over Christine's costume as she is moving among them.

into submission, There is an atmosphere of impending
trouble, with men shouting and banging the table with
fists and glasses.

Her voice 1s drowned out now in the raging of the crowd.
She is trying to make the atage, but doesn't quite make
it. A thick-necked Sergeant grabs her.

. SERGEANT :
All right, Fraulein, 1f you wont,

He holds her, bends down and rips one trouser~leg open,
exposing her leg above the knee, the stocking and the
fancy garter. She kicks him, Another soldier grabs
her and rips the other trouser-leg. The stampede is on.

The men packed around the bar also surge forward to get
an Sy melee, leaving Vole alone, sipping his schnapps
etly.

Christine is fighting back, kicking at those in reach,
hitting at others with her accordion. The musicians,
too, are in on the scrimmage, as are the waiters, all
trying to protect her. From OFF come sirens, shrill
whistles and screeching of brakes. -

A dozen British M.P.'s come surging in, past Vole at
the bar. ‘They fight their way through to the heart

' of the roughhouse, start hauling the combatants apart,

and break up the fight. Then they start.to drag the
atruggling soldiers out.

EXT. NIGHT CLUB (NIGHT)

The M.P.'s haul the soldiers out and load them on two
large military trucks parked outside. The Pirst Drunken
Soldier is being hustled onto the truck by an MP. He
makes a last stand, grabbing his captor's trouserleg.

FIRST DRUNKEN SOLDIER
All right. --- show me your legs!

The MP. clunks him .on the head with his night stick,,
then heaves him onto the truck.

As the last of the soldiers is being dragged out of the
night club, an MP. officer plasters an Out of Bounds
sign smack over Christine Helm's center section, Catcalis
ang hoots from the truck: On target, sir! -- Bullts-eye,
Leftenant! -- Kill-foy} -- Hoch der Kaiser]

The Lieutenant gets into the front seat of the lead truck
and both drive off, the soldiers hooting and shouting.
The street is deserted again.

To the right of the night club is a completely shattered
puliding. All that is standing is a door, The door
opens and Leonerd Vole comes out blithely, carefully
closing the door again, Without any hesitation he goes
to the night club. For a second he stops at the poster.
fhe OFF LIMITS sign has come loose at one corner. He
presses it down, smoothing it out, then goes down the
steps just as the disheveled misicians are coming out
with their instruments.

INT. NIGHT clus (wicHT)

As Vole reenters, the waiters’ are trying to clean up

the mess of overturned tables, chairs and broken glesses.
Through the overturned furniture he sees Christine, her
trouser-legs torn, crawling about, looking for something.

Vole extends a package of cigarettes and some chewing gum,

VOLE
Cigarette? Gum?

She takes a piece of gum, removes the wrapper and puts
the gum in her mouth, Vole, his eyes on her legs,
automatically takes out a pocket lighter and snaps it
on, holding it out to her.

The facts in this case are simple,

You will hear how the prisoner

made the acquaintance of Mrs.

with kindness and even affection.
The nature of that affection you ca
will have to decide for yourselves.
On the night of October lith, last,
between nine-thirty and ten o'clock,
Mrs. French was murdered and medical
testimony will be introduced to
prove that death was caused by a4
blow from a blunt and heavy
instrument, and 1t is the case

for the Prosecution that the blow

had been committed? .

HEARNE

Yes. Things were strewn about

and a window had been broken near
the catch. There wes glass on the
floor and fragments were found
outside. The glass outside was

not consistent with the window
having been forced from the outside.

What you are saying is that
someone attempted to make it look
as though the window had been forced
from the outside, isn't that so?

make, Inspector?

SIR WILFRID
You say that the only fingerprints ~
you found were those of Mrs. French,
Janet MacKenzie and the prisoner,
Leonard Vole. In your experience
when a burglar breaks in, does he
usually leave fingerprints,
or does he wear gloves?

He wéars gloves.

in a case of robbery would hardly
surprise you?

might have entered what was presumably
an empty house, might have suddenly
encountered Mrs. French and struck
her «- then realizing that she was
dead, panicked and fled without
taking anything?

HEARNE -
Yes, sir-- that is certainly
possible.

Carter catches her eye, nods, signals to Mayhew. Mayhew
signals to Brogan-Moore who leans close to Sir Wilfrid,
whispering something. Sir Wilfrid has been twirling his
monocie on its cord. He nods, takes out the white pill
box, from which he removes.one pill, Brogan-Moore lifts
out the thermos bottle, unscrews the cap and fills .it,
handing it to Sir Wilfrid. Wilfrid looks up at Mas

a snifter, inhales the aroma and swallows the contents
appreciatively.

with him calling so often. Talking
and laughing they were, but it was
no business of mine, so I went up-
stairs and fetched my pattern.

You say that you reentered the
house at twenty-five past nine? >

JANET
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in
my room, right next to my clock, and
I saw the time. ‘Twenty-five past nine.

had occurre .

Sir Wilfrid is still doodling with his pills, but at this
question he leaps to his feet.

SIR WILFRID
My lord, I mst protest.

I will not allow that question to be
answered, Mr. Myers.

(to Janet)
How much did you know about the
prisoner?

JANET
I knew that he needed money.

MYERS
Did you ever hear him ask Mrs.
Prench for money?

JANET
He was too clever for that.

Were you aware, Miss MacKenzie,
that Teonard Vole was a married
man‘

JANET
No indeed! Neither was the
mistress.

let me put it this way .e«.
(Wilfrid sits

You formed the opinion

that Mrs. French thought Leonard

Vole a single man? Have you any

facts. to support that opinion?

JANET
here was the books she ordered,
The Life of Baroness Burdett
Couts and one about Disraeli and his
wife. Both of them about women whota
married men years younger than
themselves. I knew what she was
thinking.

JUDGE

I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

Members of the Jury, it is possible
for 8 woman to read the Life of
Disraeli without contemplating
marriage with a man younger than
herself.

MZERS
(after laugher has
- subsided)
Miss MacKenzie, . were you aware
of what arrangements Mrs. French
had made for the disposal of her
money?

JANET
Yes, she had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up. I heard
her calling her solicitor, Mr.
Stokes. He was there, too, the
prisoner, I mean.

MYERS
You heard the prisoner and Mrs.
French discussing her new will?

JANET
Aye. He was to have all her
money, she told him, as she
had no near relatives nor
anybody who meant to her what
he dia.

That concludes my examination,

‘Janet rises, is about to leave the box, but Sir Wilfrid

stops her.

(quietly)
Not just yet, Miss MacKenzie.

She gives him an angry look and resumes her place in
the box.

SIR

(monocle in eye)
Miss MacKenzie, you have given
testimony about two wills:
in. the ola will, the will
that was revoked, were you
not to receive the buik of
Mrs. French's estate?

wv
Aye. ‘That is so.

SIR WILFRID
Whereas in the new will, except
fora bequest to you of a small
anmity, the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner, Ieonard Vole?

JANET
It will be a wicked injustice if
he ever touches a penny of that
money.

SIR WILFRID
It is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the
prisoner,

ANET
I'm not antagonistic to him. He's
a shiftless scheming rascal - but
I'm not antagonistic to him
SIR WILFRID
I suggest that you have formed
this opinion because his friendship
with your mistress cost you the bulk
of her estate.

JANET
I never liked hin.

- SIR WILFRID .
Your candour is refreshing. Now,
on the night of September 14th,
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs. French talking together.
What did you hear them say?

 

JANET
tr aLdant hear what they sctuslly said.

SIR WILFRID
You mean you only heard the voices --
the mxmyr of voices?

JANET
They were laughing.

STR WILFRID
What makes yo: say the man's voice
was Teonard Vo'.e?

JANET
I know his voice well enough.

SIR WILFRID
The door was closed, was it not?

JANET
Yes.

SIR WILFRID
You were no doubt in a hurry to
get the pattern, so you probably
walked quickly past the closed
Gcoor -— yet you are sure that
you heard Leonard Vole's voice?

JANET
Iwas there long enough to hear
what I heard. .

Come, Miss MacKenzie, I'm sure
you don't wish to suggest to the
Jury that you were eavesdropping.

JANET
I know it was him in there with
her. Who else could it have been?

SIR WILFRID
Exactly! What you mean is you
wanted it -to be him. Thatts the
way your mind worked. Now, tell
me, did Mrs. French sometimes
watch television in the evening? .

JANET
Aye. She was fond of a talk, or
& good play.

sir

Wasn't 1t possible that on the
evening when you returned home
and passed the door, that what
you really heard was the television
and a man and woman's voices, and
laughter?

(to the Jury)
There was a play called *Ioverts

do you prefer to be called?

CHRISTINE
It does not matter.

SIR WILFRID

Does it not? In this country

we are inclined to take a rather
more serious view of marriage.
However - Freu Helm, it would
appear that when you first mt
the prisoner in Hamburg you lied
to him about your marital status?

I wanted to get out of Germany, 80 ===

You lied, did you not? Just "yes"
or “no,” please

arranging the marriage, you lied

CHRISTINE
I.did not tell the truth to the
authorities.
SIR WILFRID
You lied to them?
CHRISTINE
Yes. .
SIR WILFRID

And in the ceremony of marriage
itself, when you swore to love
and to honor and to cherish your

Yes. A lie.

accidentally cut his wrist,
you lied?

witnesses you have heard Chief

Inspector Hearne, who has given his

losses. One, the death of her beloved

she had fully expected to receives I will

SIR WILFRID (CONT'D)
== but will express only my
deepest sympathy for her in
both these mishaps.

And finally -- most damaging of
all - the Prosecution has: produced
8 surprise witness, one Chris tine
Helm --whom the prisoner married
and brought from the rubble of her
homeland to the safety of this
country, giving her his love and
the protection of his name. I
objected to her testimony beceuse

a wife cannot give evidence harmful
to her husband, but it hes been
proven that her marriage to Leonard
Vole was fraudulent end bigamous.
Therefore, her evidence mst be
admitted and you mist consider

4t for what it 1s vorth.

Such is the Prosecutionts case.
Now it is the turn of the Defense.
We could present, on behalf of
the prisoner, a variety of
witnesses to his character, his
war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.
However, only one witness can
shed new light on this tragic
riddle -- the prisoner himself.

Anquiring about prices and
schedules of foreign cruises?

crime, is it?

Not at all. Many people go for

But you c % pay for it, cou.

you, Mr. Vole?
VOIE
Iwas hard up. I %old you so.

MYERS
And yet you came into this
particular travel agency -
with ablonde -- a honey bionde,
I understand --

A term for a lady with hair like

Laughter in Court. Wot in Sir Wilfria's camp, however,
where he and his associates are huddled with very worried

- faces. ,

In the Gallery, Miss Plimsoll is looking down at the Bar.
Her blonde neighbor is biting her lip.

Miss PLIMSOLL
(locking at the Judge)
Quite a sense of humor!
Wouldn't strike him so funny
if he were in the Dock.

Below, the Courtroom has settled down again,

MZERS

{not letting Vole

off the hook)
You then admit that you made
inquiries about the most
expensive and luxurious
cruises. How did you expect
to pay for such a thing?

- VOLE
I don't know, it was --

MWERS
If you don't know -- perhaps I
can help you. On the morning of
the ve ame day, according to
. Stoxes, you heard Mrs. French
change her will, leaving you the
bulk of her money --

VOLE .
I didn't! I knew nothing about
the willl
, MZERS
-- and in the afternoon, you
started making plans to dispose
of the money!
Jus

ha.

VOLE
No! It was nothing of the kind!
Tas in a pub, and I met this
girl -- I don't even know her
mame -- we had a couple of drinks
and then we walked out together --
we passed thet display window with
fancy posters with blue seas and
palm trees -- the Grecian Islands,
or some plece -- so we went in --
dust for the fun of it -- and we
asked for some folders. The man
gave me sort of a funny lock --
because I looked 8 bit shabby --
and it irritated me so I kept
asking for the swanklest tours --
all de luxe and a cabin on the boat
deck -- just putting on an act --

MYERS
An act? No, not an act -- you
knew that in a week you were
‘going to inherit 80,000 pounds!

: VOLE
No, 1t was nothing like that!

It was make-velieve and childish--
but it was fun and I enjoyed

4t. I wasn'* thinking of

killing anybody, or inheri

Any money!

: MYERS
It was just remarkable coincidence
that Mrs. French should be
killed only a week later?

VOLE
I've told you - I didn't kill her!

MZERS -
Can you suggest any reason why
the witness, Christine Helm,
should deliberately give the
evidence she has given if it
were not true?

VOLE
(starting to break)
No, I dontt. I don't know why
my wife - I dontt even know why
I still cali her my wife --she
mist be lying, or out of her mind.
ke.

MYERS .

She seemed remarkably sane, and
gelf-possessed, But insanity is
the only reason you can suggest?

VOLE
I don't understend it!
-( tértured)
Oh, God, what's happened - what's
changed her?!

. MYERS
very effective, I'm sure. But
in this Court, we deal with fact.
And the fect is, Mr. Vole, that
we have only your word for it,
that you left Emily Prench's
house at the time you say you
dia, and that you arrived home
at five and twenty minutes past
nine, and that you did not go
out again.

VOLE

(wildly)
Someone mst have seen me - in
the street -

(to Jury)
- or going into the house.

MYERS
One would certainly think so -
put the only person who did
see you come home that wight says
dit was at ten minutes past ten.
An@ she ssys that you had blood
on your clothes.

VOLE
(throws arm. out)
I cut my wrists ~

MYERS
You cut your wrist deliberately!

I can hear it myself!

You came home at ten past ten!

The dominant feature of the place is a mirrored bar
of dark wood, crowded with travelers and Juzesgee
Tables and chairs fill the rest of the room. Tail
windows give a view of the trains, travelers and
attendants outside the Buffet. Intermittently there
is the rumble of trains in arrival or departure, and
jets of steam from the engines»

Sir Wilfrid comes in briskly, followed by Mayhew. He is a
bit short of breath, still puffing nervously on his cigar.
The two men scan the room for their rendezvous- They move
down the bar until they see someone who fits the bill. A
“middle-aged brunette woman, flamboyantly dressed, with a

Jigger of whiskey and a beer chaser at her elbow. She is
reading an afternoon paper with the headline: VOLE TRIAL

IN THIRD DAY. She is overly made up and her hair is marcell-
ea to fall over one side of her face. Her generel attitude
indicates quite a few whiskeys and beer chasers. She senses
their presence when they stop and look up in the bar mirror.

During this, Vole standing in the Deck, sees that Sir
Wilfrid's place at the Ber is vacant. He looks around
nervously for bis counsel. Meyhew, too, is missing.

The Judge bows to the Court and sits, everyone following.

JUDGE
_ Since the Defense has called tut one
witness -- the prisoner -- it has the
right to be heard lest in summation.
Therefore, Mr. Myers, if you are ready,

Prosecution.

Myers rises, adjusts his robe and wig with the air of a
man contemplating imminent, certain triumph,

MYERS

My Lord --- members of the jury -~ I
shall be brief in my final speech be-
cause I think the Prosecution hes
proved so obvious a case of murder
against the prisoner, Leonard Vcle,

the only possible conclusion, I will
briefly summerize these facts ---

SIR WILFRID .

seat)
I am indeed, my lord! The summetion
for the Crown, however, is premature ---
I ask thet the case for the defense be
reopened and that a witness be recalled!

There 1s a reaction in the Courtroom. Vole looks at
Sir Wlifrid with ea new glint of hope. Drogen-Moore is
puzzled by this approach.

My lord, I must strenuously object
to the reopening cf e case which
the Prosecution regards as clozed.

SIR WILFRID
Evidence of the most startling nature
has come into my possession only last

night --- -
MYERS
My lord, the course my learned
friend preposes is quite unprecedented.

SIR WILFRID

I have anticipated my friend's
orjection and I am prepared to meet
it with ample precedent. There is,
first, the case of The Crown against
Stillman -- which wes reported at

by rote)
page 463 of the 1926 Appeal Cases ---
also, the Crown against Porter, August
11, 1930, reported at the Winchester
Assizes, at page 231, and before the
Divisional Court the following October,
reported at page 153 of 1942 Kings Bench

Now, what is this new evidence, Sir

Letters, my lord. Written by Christine
Hein,

’

There is a sharp reaction from Vole. Sir Wilfrid has
given the letters to an Usher, who takes them to the
Judge. As the Judge inspects the letters --

MYERS
My lore, the Prosecution contimues
its objection. if my memory serves
me well, your Lordship's similar
objection -- in the King against
Sullivan -- was sustained.

JUDGE
Your memery for once serves you 413,
Mr. Myers. My objection was over-
ruled by Mr. Justice Swindon -- as

yours is now, by me!

He hands the packet of blue letters to the Usher, who
earries them back to Sir Wilfrid.

SIR WILFRID

(his voice ringing)
Call Christine Helm!

The call is repeated by the Usher and Policemen at the
door. Christine enters, her customary impassive self,
proceeding to the Witness Box. Vole stares at her blankly,
then he tries te catch Sir Wilfrid's eye, as if hoping

for a clue to the proceedings. Sir Wilfrid gives him an
encouraging noc. ~

The Usher helps Christine to a stool near the table. She

JUIGE
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the
letter in question so that the Jury
can hear it.

SIR WILFRID
( reading)

My belovec Max. An extreordinary
thing has happened. All our difficul ties
may goon be solved. Teonard is suspected
of mrdering the old lady I told you .
about. Hig only hope of an alibi
depends on me -- on me alone. Suppose
I testified that he ves not at home
with me et the time of the murder --
that he came home with blood on his
sleeves and that he even admitted
to me that he had killed her. Strange,
isntt it -- he alvays said he would
never let me leave him --- but now,
if this succeeds, he will be leaving
me -- because they will teke hin
‘away, forever --- and T shall be
free, and yours, my beloved ---
I count the hours until we are
together --~ Christine.

paring this, SHOTS of the Jury, of Miss Plimsoll and the
blonde neighbor, of Myers, snd 8 bewildered Vole staring
at his sobbing wife.

Sir Wilfrid is short of breath when he finishes, and his
hand is under his robe to ease the pain in his chest.

JUDGE
Mrs. Helm, will you go back to
the witness box?

The Usher helps her to the Box. She 1s pale, her
cheeks streaked with tears.

SIR WILFRID -
I now ask you again, Christine
Helm, did you write this letter?

VOLE
(wildly)
Christine, tell him you aidan? t
write it! I know you didn't!

SIR WILFRID

(speaking with difficulty)

Please answer my question --~ :
did you write this letter?
47. JUDGE

Before answering, Mrs. Helm, I wish

to warn you: the law regarding perjury
in this country is very severe. If

you have already committed perjury

dn this courtroom, I strongly advise
you not to adé to your crime. But if
this letter hes not been written by you,
then now is the time to categorically
state this fact!

(mristine looks from the Judge to Vole -- then to sir’
wilfrid.

CHRISTINE

(quietly)
I wrote the letter.

giving him an injection, to which Sir Wilfrid doesn't:
react at all. His mind 1s elsewhere; he seems troubled.

132.
INT. COURTROOM = (DAY)

The Jury is filing back into its seatse There is a hush
of expectation.

Leonard Vole, nerves strained to the breaking point, is
in the Docke His eyes anxiously scan the Jurors, as if
to try to guess their verdict. Then his gaze wanders
toward Sir Wilfrid and Brogan-Moore, just seating them-
selves. Sir ‘yilfrid, leaning forward, does not meet his
eyese He looks past the Dock toward -~

The glass-panelled door leading into the Courtroom. Tho
Courtroom Officer stands on guard. The door, opening
inward, is pushed just slightly open and through the
aperature we see Christine tensely awaiting the verdict.

In the Gallery, the spectators are silent, motionless, in
taut anticipation of the result. Among them is Miss
Plimsoll and beside her, the dark girl.

In the Court, the Clerk rises.

CLERK
The prisoner will stand up.
Vole and the Warders rise. |

CLERK
Members of the Jury, are you all
agreed upon your verdict?

POREMAN
(rising)
We ares

CLERK
Do you find the prisoner at the
bar, Leonard Stephen Vols, guilty
or not guilty? ~

Vole is trying to stand steady. The palms of his hands
are moist and he automatically rubs them against his coat.

FOREMAN
Not guilty, my lord.

Excitement breaks loose. There is a burst of applause
and some cheers.

Vole sits down abruptly, exhausted. His eyes close
tightly for a moment.
129.

4g. In the Gallery, where all the spectators, including Miss
Plimsoll, are cheering and applauding, her brunette
neighbor is weeping.

Myers turns toward Sir Wilfrid and makes a gallant gesture
of salute in defeat. Sir Wilfrid, leaning forward, doss
not see Myers, but Brogan-Hoore nudges him. He turns
toward Myers, with a casual gesture of acknowledgment,
then turns back toward the glass-panelled door.

In the slightly open doorway, Christine Vole 1s standing,
her face completely immobile. She withdraws her hand and
the door slowly closes, blocking her from views ~-

During this, the Usher is trying to re-establish order.

Silence! Silence}

The Courtroom calms down.

JUDGE
Leonard Stephen Vole, you have been
found not guilty of the murder of
Bally Jane French on September 1th.
You are hereby discharged and are
free to leave the Court.

He rises, the Courtroom rises with him. He bows to the
Court and the Court bows back. Then the Judge exits,-
followed by the Alderman and Judge's Clerk.

There is again an upsurge of excitement. Spectators are
trying to reach Vole, but are pushed toward the exits by
the police and warders- Vole shakes hands with his
warders. The Jury is filing out, as do Myers and his
associates. The Gallery, too, is. emptying.

USHER

(during this)
All persons who have anything ~
further to do before the Queen's
Justices of Oyer and Terminer and
general gaol delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal
Court may depart hence’ and give your
attendance here again tomorrow
morning at 10:30 o'clock. God Save
The Queen.

Vole, jubilant, has coms down from the Dock and is shaking
hands with Carter, Mayhew, Brogan-Moore, and finaliy comes
to Sir Wilfrid who is silently leaning forward in his chair.

VOLE
Thank you, Sir Yilfrid. Thank you
for everything. You were wonderful,

SIR WILFRID
Letts say we were lucky ail around..

A Warder carrying a large envelope has come up.

WARDER
I have your belongings -- if you'll ‘
be kind enough to come with me, Hre
Vole, and sign the papers, we can
release you,

VOLE
Mister Vole: They didn't call me
mister when they checked me ins

MAYEEW
Ttil go along with you. I've
brought your coat and your hat.

. VOLE
Let's go quickiy, before they
change their mind.

They go into the Prisoner's Dock and down the steps
leading below. A policeman and usher are gathering
up the exhibits.

BROGAN-MOORE
{looking after Vole,
smiling)
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago
he had one foot on the gallows
and the other on a banana peel.
(to Wilfrid)
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid. -
(Wilfrid's brow 1s lined with
thought ) -
Are you?

SIR WILFRID
Not yet. We've disposed of the
gallows, but. there is still that
banana peel -- somewhere -- under
somebody's foot.

There is the sound of angry commotion outside the Court-
room's Hain Fntrance. The Policeman and Usher, who have
been collecting the exhibits, drop their work and go
quickly to investigate. Sir Wilfrid, Brogan-Moore and
Carter look OFF.

13h.

4g. Through the glass-panelled door we can see a bit of a

riot -- the crowd in an ugly mood, shouting insults and
waving fists. The Policeman and Usher try to break it
up, and we see that the object of the crowd is Christine.

The Policeman and Usher help her into the Courtroom. She
is dishevelled, a little roughed up, her hat in one hand,
and she is rubbing her shin. :

POLICEMAN ‘
Better wait here until we get rid
of that crowd, Madam.

CHRISTINE
Thank you.

Policeman and Usher go out again to break up the
disturbance. .

Sir Wilfrid, Brogan-Moore and Carter look at. her. Then
Carter resumes gathering up the defense papers, also
bringing up Sir Wilfrid's thermos from under his seat.

CARTER
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll. will
be waiting.

SIR WILFRID :
Let me finish the last of the cocoa-=-
(uncapoing the thermos)
While I em still beyond her
jurisdiction.

He motions to Carter and to Brogan-Moore to get out.
Now he is alone in the Courtroom with Christine.

Be sips the brandy, studying her over the rim of the cupe
She brushes her suit, straightens her stockings, looks
around as if for something she had lost.

CHRISTINE ~
I never thought you British could
get so emotional -- especially in
a public place.

SIR WILFRID
I apologize for my compatriots.

CHRISTINE
It's all right. I don't mind being
called names or pushed around, or
even kicked in: the shin -- but now I
have a ladder in my last pair of nylons.

SIR WILFRID
In case you're not familiar with
our prison regulations -- no silk
stockings.

CHRISTINE
Prison? Will I go to prison?

SIR WILFRID
You heard the learned judge» You
will quite certainly be charged '
with perjury, tried for it, and’

‘to prison you shall go.

CRHISTINE
Well -» it won't be for life,
will, 1t? :

SIR WILFRID

If I were retained for the
prosecution, it would be.

CRHISTINE

You loath me, don't you? Like

the people outside ‘What a wicked
woman J am, and how brilliantly -

ou exposed me, and saved Leonard's

ie. The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts
did it agains
(firmly)

Well, let me tell you something --
you didn't do it alone! You had
helpt

SIR WILFRID
What are you driving at?

CHRISTINE
I am -not driving at anything any
more -- Leonard is free, and we
did its

SIR WILFRID
We?

CHRISTINE
That's right. Remember when I
came to see you, and you said
that no jury would believe an
alibi given by a loving wife,
no matter how much she swore
that her husband was imnocent?
That gave me the idea. --
Loe

SIR WILFRID
What idea?

CHRISTINE
The idea that I should be a witness,
not for my husband, but for the
prosecutic = that T should swear
eonard was guilty -=- and
that you should expose me as 4
vicious liar -~ because only then, ’

would they believe that Leonard
was innocent!

He stares at her, fimbling for his monocle- She
erosses slowly toward hin.

CHRISTINE
So now you know the whole story,
Sir Wilfrid.
(lapsing into Cockney)
Itll give you somethin' to dream
about, misters

She leans over, and like the Cockney woman in the
Euston Station, pulis the hair from one side of her face:

CHRISTINE
Wanne kiss me, Ducky?

SIR WILFRID
(shocked)
I suspected something -- but not
that -- never thats

Christine re-adjusts her hair, speaks gently now to
Sir Wilfrid, who is plainly stunned.

CHRISTINE
Thank you for the compliment. It's
been a long time since I was an ~
actress, and I never before played
' such an important role --

SIR WILFRID
And all those blue letters? --

CHRISTINE
It took me hours to write them --
to invent Max -- there never was
a Mex, there never has been anyone
but Leonard << only Leonard.
ho.

SIR WILFRID
(with some difficulty)
My dear -- could you not have trusted
me? == worked with me truthfully and
honorably? -- we would have wone

CHRISTINE
I could not run that risk. You
see, you thought he was innocent --

SIR WILFRID :
And you knew he was innocent. I
understand.
"CHRISTINE

No, Sir Wilfrid, you do not
understand at all --

What?
(stunned disbelief)
Not That can't be true. No!

CHRISTINE

(a low, urgent voice)
Listen to me -= once and for all ~--
Leonard came home a few minutes
past ten -- he had biood on the
sleeves of his Jacket -- he did
tell me he had killed the woman.
Only I could save him -- he pleaded
with me --

SIR WILFRID

And you saved him «- a murderer!
CHRISTINE

Again, you don't. understand - ~

T love him.

She looks off. The Camera pans to the Barristers’
door, where Vole is standing in his trench coat,
hat in hand. He is smi: complacentiy. He has
been standing there for a little while, and has ~
overheard.
133.

VOLE
(to Wilrrid)
I told you she was an actress --
and a good onee <--
(moving easily
toward them) .
I knew she would do something for

_ me = I just didn't know what, or

CHRISTINE

She starts to embrace him. He doesn't respond to her,
instead looks over her shoulder at Sir Wilfrid.

» VOLE
Fooled you canpletely, didn't she?

SIR WILFRID
It's you, Vole, who really fooled
me ==

be so stupid and so blind --

VOLE
Easy -- we both got out of it
alive -- let's stay this way --
({aeeing Wilfrid
gasping with fury)

WILFRID
There are still courts in England --
they're not through with you yet.

VOLE -
Oh, yes they are -- you've done
.too good a job» You got me off,
and I can't be tried again --
that's the lew, and you por it.

You can't touch him now --
nobody can. —

You'll pay for this somehow --
they'll hang you --

VOLE

No, they won't. As for paying
for it -- let's double your fee --
there'll be plenty of money when
the will coes through -- I'm not
cheap -~ I want everybody to get
something out of it. There's Janet
MacKenzie -- let's get her that
new hearing aid --

4a coking at '

Wilfrid's thermos)
And a new one of those for you --
18 karat gold, if they make one-

(and to Christine)
And when they try you for perjury,
there'll be 5,000 pounds to get
you off easy-

CHRISTINE

I don't care, Leonard -- just so
wetll be together again -<- you
don't know what I went through
standing in the witness box,
having to face you in the dock
and saying I never loved you --

(she kisses him, but

he does not respond)
Leonard, what is it?

She looks at him anxiously, then tries to kiss him
again. He draws away, looking past her. She turns
dn the same direction. Miss Plimsoll enters with
the brunette girl.

MISS PLINSOLL

Sir Wilfrid -- the luggage is in
the car == wetve only 20 minutes
to make the boat train --

(then aware of the girl)
Oh -- this is a nice young la
I met in the gallery during the
trial --

(she stops astounded

as the girl runs to

Vole)

GIRL
Lent Oh, Leni They've been
trying to keep me away from
you -= it's had me nearly crazy--

They kiss, and in merked contrast to Christine's
embrace, Vole returns it with some enthusiasm.
~A

CHRISTINE
(shocked)
Leonard -- who is this girl?

GIRL
I'm not this girl -- I'm his
girl -- tell her, Len-

Vole doesn't reply, grins uneasily at Christine with
.@ self-conscious shrug- It gradually dawns on Christine.

. : CHRISTINE
Leonard, is this the girl who was
with you in the travel bureau -~
the girl you said you hardly imew --
didn't even Imow her name? -<-

GIRL
That's right -- that's who I am.
And I know all about you. You're
not his wife; never have been.
You're years older than he is.
We've been going together for months
and we're going away on one of those
cruises -- just like they said in
court <= tell her yourself, Lene

CHRISTINE
(calmly, controlled
with difficulty)
Yes, Len, tell me yourself.

VOLE
(very simply)
Sorry, Christine. That's how it is»
CHRISTINE
Not
VOLE
(to the girl)
Come on Diana, let's go-

Miss Plimsoll and Sir Wilfrid are watching the scene.
Sir Wilfrid is spinning his monocle on the. ribbon,

_ the-light flashing from it.

Vole and the girl have taken a few steps and are near
the exhibit table when Christine steps forward quickly,
holding Vole by the arm-

CHRISTINE
(near hysteria)
Leonard; you can't! -= not after
what I've done. I won't let you --

VOLE
(pushing her away)
You're being silly now. I saved
your life getting you out of
Germany -- you saved mine getting
me out of this messe So we're '
even» It's all overs

CHRISTINE
Don't, Leonard -- don't leave me

VOLE
Now pull yourself together. They'll
have you up here for perjury -~ don't
make it worse or they'll try you 2s
an accessory, and you know what that
means«

CHRISTINE
(holding on to him)
Let them. Let them try me for
perjury, or an accessory --
{he shakes himself
loose from her. Her
eyes fall on the flickering
+ from Wilfrid's monocle,
flashing on the blade of
the knife on the exhibit
table)
== or better yet, let them try me
for murder}

She grabs the Imife, lurches after him, and with one
wild swoop plunges the knife into him. He looks at
her as if almost in surprise, then crumples instantly-
Diana shrieks piercingly- -
Christine stands quietly erect, the imife no longer in
her hand. Miss Plimsoll rushes forward, professional
nurse thet she is, and kneels beside Vole, her hand on
8 wrist.

Sir Wilfrid, still twirling his monocle, turns his eyes
to the main door, thru which come running three court
efficers, drawn by the girl's scream- They swoop down
on Christine, surrounding Vole's body.

(

Uy?»

Sir Wilfrid sits quietly, watching. From off we

hear an officer cry "Get a doctor}" and the sobbing
of Diana. Then Miss Plimsoll comes to Wilfride He
looks up at here

MISS PLIMSOLL
She killed him-

SIR WILFRID
(shaking his head) '
She executed him.

Sir Wilfrid looks off toward Christine. A policeman is

by the body and giving unheard instructions. Two
policemen start to lead Christine out. Carter, distraught
and puzzled, comes in, makes his way to Sir Wilfrid.e .

CARTER
{not realizing)
I -= I've sent the luggage on
ahead, and Itve got a car waiting
outside.

When Carter gasps as he sees- But Wilfrid's eyes are
still on the big main doors through which the police
are just taking out Christine. She stops in the open
doors, looks back at Wilfrid» Miss Plimsoll looks at
Wilfrid, then at the doors, then back to him.

ove @ remarkable woman!

CARTER
You can just barely make the
boat train, Sir Wilfrid.

MISS PLIMSOLL
(softly)
Better bring the luggage back, =
and you can dismiss the car -=-
(to Sir Wilfrid)
=- we're not going yet, are we?

There is a long exchange of looks. between the two, then
Miss Plimsoll reaches down for his wig, hands it to him.
SIR WILFRID ,
(a declaration of love)
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

He gets. up with some difficulty and straightens ups
.

SIR WILFRID
(to Carter)
Get Brogan=Hooze to my chambers »
and have Mayhew there, too. We
are appearing for the defense in
the trial of Christine Vole-

He moves away from his seat and walks past the Bench to
the barristers' exit, an erect and dignified figure.

Miss Plimsoll looks after him with great prides She '
suddenly sees the thermos pottle.

MISS PLIMSOLL
(calling after him)
Sir Wilfrid! -- you forgot your brandy!

He stops, smiling. She grabs the thermos and takes it

to him quickly» He puts bis arm across her shoulder
as they walk out of the courtrooms
