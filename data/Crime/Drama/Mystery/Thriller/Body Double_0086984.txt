DOUBT

A screenplay by
John Patrick Shanley

based on his stage play
7 A.M. SUNDAY MORNING, THE BRONX. LATE OCTOBER, 1964.

We’re on Beach Avenue. On the left, a block of apartment
buildings glow gold in the sun. On the right, private houses.
Some trees, some leaves falling. The apartment buildings are
five stories high, the private homes two stories. It’s a
clean, peaceful place. There’s not a soul to be seen.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING
An old man plays a zither.
INT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING BEDROOM - MORNING
12-year-old JIMMY HURLEY is asleep. He’s all boy, rough
working class haircut, freckles. His MA comes in, still in
nightclothes and shakes him. SHE TURNS ON THE LIGHT.
MA
Jimmy, come on. You’re serving
today.

The boy wakes and Ma leaves. He sits up in his pajamas.

WARREN (0.S.)
Christeeeen! Where’s my pants?

MA (0.S.)
On the bed. If they had teeth,
they would’ve bit you.

WARREN (0.S.)
If my pants had teeth they'd be in
the Smithsonian Institute in
Washington.

Jimmy gets out of bed.

EXT. JIMMY’S BEDROOM WINDOW - MORNING

There’s a fire escape.

EXT. NOW WE SEE THE WHOLE ALLEY - MORNING

Which is formed by these apartment buildings. It’s a strange,
gloomy, expressionistic sight. Nothing but fire escapes
facing each other to the left and right, a 30 foot gap of
cracked concrete between. The TITLE APPEARS:

DOUBT

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. A MAN OUTSIDE PLAYS THE ZITHER.
JIMMY WALKS OUT TO A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

ZITHER MAN
Jimmy! Go to the store, buy me the
newspaper and cigarettes.

JIMMY
Can't. Serving mass. I’m an alter
boy.

EXT. SAINT NICHOLAS CHURCH AND SCHOOL - DAY

It’s old brown brick, more school than church in appearance.
Trees. Nice place. Kevin is coming out of the candy store
across the street. He and Jimmy greet each other as Jimmy

heads for a side door.

JIMMY
Hey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hey, Jimmy!
INT. EMPTY CHURCH - DAY

The organist sits down and prepares for mass.

INT. A CHANGING ROOM BEHIND THE ALTAR - DAY

A closet, a bench. It’s dimly lit. Jimmy is staring up at a
painting. He turns at the sound of a door. DONALD MILLER
rushes in. He’s also 12, a bit chubby, black.

JIMMY
There you are.

DONALD
Overslept.

JIMMY

Well, you made it. I’1l do the
cruets if you light the charcoal.

(CONTINUED)
DONALD
You think I’m fat?

JIMMY
You're alright. What? Clothes don’t
fit?

DONALD
No, they fit.

Donald moves to the closet; he begins to unbutton his shirt.
Jimmy exits with the candle snuffer.
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY
The Hurleys step out of their building.
MA
You're gonna be going to the bakery

after mass.

WARREN
I am? Why don’t you go?

MA
I’m gonna be making breakfast.

WARREN
I can make breakfast.

MA
When have you ever? Funny man.

Another man greets a woman on her way to church.

INT. IN THE CHANGING ROOM - A TABLE - DAY
Jimmy fills the cruets with water and wine. Donald lights
the charcoal in the incense burner. Jimmy carries the cruets
past Flynn, who is preparing for the service.
JIMMY
Good morning, Father.

INT. THE CHURCH - THE ORGANIST PLAYS - DAY

The choir sings HOLY GOD WE PRAISE THY NAME.

(CONTINUED)
EXT. THE STREETS OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - DAY

PARISHIONERS, all working class people, are walking to
church. Everyone is dressed quite nicely. The older women
wear hats, the younger women have napkins pinned to their
hair. The men are in jackets and ties; they’ve used hair
tonic; some wear hats. People say good morning.

INT. THE CHURCH - THE ORGANIST PLAYS - DAY

Parishioners file in and sit down.

CUT TO:

INT. THE CHURCH ALTAR - FATHER FLYNN AT THE PULPIT - DAY

He’s an educated man with a slight Eastern seaboard working
class accent.

End of song. END OF CREDITS.

FLYNN
Be seated.

THE CONGREGATION SITS.
THE ALTAR BOYS SIT - IT’S JIMMY AND DONALD.
The boys look to the priest.

BACK TO FLYNN WHO LOOKS THE CONGREGATION OVER AND THEN
POSITS:

FLYNN
What do you do when you’re not
sure? That’s the topic of my sermon
today.

NOW WE SEE SISTER JAMES IN ONE OF THE PEWS LISTENING.
She wears the black bonnet of the order of the Sisters of

Charity. She’s young and she’s good. Do you remember what
good is? We hear Flynn while we look at her.

(CONTINUED)
FLYNN (0.S.)
Last year, when President Kennedy
was assassinated, who among us did
not experience the most profound
disorientation? Despair?

Sister James eyes shine with tears.
BACK TO FLYNN

FLYNN
Which way? What now?

NOW TO A SLOW TRACKING SHOT OF A WHOLE FAMILY
PARENTS (RAPT), a NEWBORN, KIDS (Subtle squirm).
FLYNN (0.S.)
What do I say to my kids? What do I
tell myself? It was a time of
people sitting together, bound
together by a common feeling of
hopelessness.
BACK TO FLYNN
FLYNN
But think of that! Your BOND with
your fellow being was your Despair.
It was a public experience. It was
awful, but we were in it together.
HIGH ANGLE MASTER SHOT OF CONGREGATION FROM BACK OF CHURCH
FLYNN (0.S.)
How much worse is it then for the
lone man, the lone woman, stricken
by a private calamity?
LOW DUTCH ANGLE:
A single of a PALE WOMAN.

FLYNN (0.S.)
‘No one knows I’m sick.’

LOW DUTCH ANGLE:

A single of a STOUT OLDER MAN.

(CONTINUED)
FLYNN (0.S.)
‘No one knows I’ve lost my last
real friend.’

BACK TO FLYNN

FLYNN
“No one knows I’ve done something
wrong.” Imagine the isolation.

Now you see the world as through a
window. On one side of the glass:
happy, untroubled people, and on
the other side: you.

A dramatic silence.
BACK TO SISTER JAMES, WHO SNEEZES.

A girl whispers, “God Bless you, Sister.” Sister James is
embarrassed.

SISTER JAMES
Thank you.

FLYNN (0.S.)
I want to tell you a story.

BACK TO FLYNN

FLYNN
A cargo ship sank one night. It
caught fire and went down. And
only this one sailor survived.
He found a lifeboat, rigged a
sail...and being of a nautical
discipline...turned his eyes to the
Heavens and read the stars.

JIMMY AND DONALD IMAGINING IT
FLYNN (0.S.)
He set a course for his home, and
exhausted, fell asleep.
Sister Aloysius gets up and walks down the aisle. We do not
see her face. On her way, she gestures to various children
to sit up and stop talking.

WILLIAM LONDON, a fidgety blond boy of 12, is heard flirting
with two girls, ALICE AND SARAH.

(CONTINUED)
WILLIAM (0.S.)

(whispers)
.+.-jJust keeps going on. I’m really
bored.
FLYNN (0.S.)

Clouds rolled in. And for the next
twenty nights, he could no longer
see the stars. He thought he was
on course, but there was no way to
be certain.

BACK TO FLYNN

FLYNN
And as the days rolled on, and the
sailor wasted away, he began to
have doubts.

Sister Aloysius walks up alongside William and the two girls,
slapping William on the back of the head.

WILLIAM
He just keeps on going. I mean - -
Ow.

FLYNN (0.S.)

Had he set his course right? Was he
still going on towards his home?

BACK TO FLYNN

FLYNN
Or was he horribly lost...

Now to a boy RAYMOND in a pew who is resting his chin on the
pew in front of him. He’s sleepy.

FLYNN (0.S.)
and doomed to a terrible death? No
way to know. The message of the
constellations - - had he imagined
it because of his desperate
circumstance? Or had he seen truth
once...

We see a nun’s habit appear by the boy and then the nun leans
down to whisper to the boy.

(CONTINUED)
SISTER ALOYSIUS APPEARS RIGHT BY THE BOY’S FACE.

Her face is obscured by the black bonnet. She rotates her
head toward the boy and she is revealed for the first time.
Her eyes like diamonds. She is terrifying.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Straighten. Up.

Raymond straightens up instantly.

Sister Aloysius, finished with the boy, rises into view. She
is listening to the sermon, watching the priest.

FLYNN (0.S.)
and now had to hold on to it
without further reassurance?

BACK TO FLYNN
FLYNN
There are those of you in church
today who know exactly the crisis
of faith I describe. And I want to
say to you: Doubt can be a bond as
powerful and sustaining as
certainty. When you are lost, you
are not alone.
SHOT OF CONGREGATION
FLYNN
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.
BACK TO SISTER ALOYSIUS
Crossing herself.

FLYNN (0.S.)
Amen. Please rise.

MASTER SHOT OF THE CONGREGATION RISING

The organ begins to play. Choir sings PRAISE GOD FROM WHOM
ALL BLESSINGS COME.

SINGLE OF DONALD SEEING SOMETHING.

(CONTINUED)
DONALD'S POV: BIRD IN THE CUPOLA.

INT. SACRISTY - DAY

DONALD
Hey, Father.
FLYNN
Hey, Champ.
DONALD
That was some sermon.
FLYNN
Did it mean something to you?
DONALD
I want to do that. I want to bea
priest.
FLYNN

You'd be a good one, I’m sure.
Here, take a look.
(He demonstrates a toy. A
dancer that turns when you
hold up a mirror. Donald

smiles)
See? (singsong) Do-do-do-do-do.
She’s dancin’. Kinda neat.
DONALD
Yeah.
FLYNN

Here. You try.
(Flynn gives it to him)
That’s for you. Take it.

DONALD
Thank you, Father.

FLYNN
You’re welcome.
EXT. THE CONVENT ATTACHED TO THE CHURCH SCHOOL - PREDAWN

There’s a garden outside with a statue of Elizabeth Seton. We
hear a hand bell being rung, not loud.
10.

INT. THE CONVENT - SISTER JAMES’ CELL - PREDAWN
Her eyes open. The bell rings again. She gets up. She is
refreshed and happy to start her day. A single bed, a sink.

INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THE NUNS EMERGING TO BEGIN THE DAY

INT. THE BEDROOM - DAWN

Sister James has bathed. She’s partially dressed but still
working on her bonnet. She puts on her rosary.

EXT. IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH SCHOOL - MORNING

SIX CLASSES of uniformed BOYS and GIRLS, 25 to a class, are
lined up in double file and headed in to the compound. Each
class is loosely overseen by a Nun.

SISTER JAMES
Like Noah’s Ark, girls. Two by
two.

CUT TO:

EXT. AN INNER COURTYARD - THE EIGHTH GRADE - OVERSEEN BY
SISTER JAMES - MORNING

FLYNN (0.S.)
Morning, Sister James.

SISTER JAMES
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Beautiful day.

NOW WE SEE FLYNN AND SISTER JAMES

Standing with her class. Jimmy’s there, as well as Donald
Miller. Sarah and Alice are faintly heard singing “This Old
Man.”

FLYNN
Not too bad.
(To the Kids)
How are the criminals doing today?

(CONTINUED)
11.

Several Kids answer “Not bad, Father.” “Good, Father.”

FLYNN
Morning, Champ.

DONALD
Morning, Father Flynn.

Flynn grabs William London's wrist playfully. William is
spunky.

FLYNN
You wash those hands today, Mister
London?
William snatches his hand away.

WILLIAM
I washed ‘em, Father.

FLYNN
I don’t know. They’re a different
color than your neck.
Kids laugh at the remark, embarrassing William. Flynn has
walked on to greet someone out of view.

EXT. THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - MORNING

Sister Aloysius is looking through the window, down on the
student populace. Her eyes narrow.

BACK TO SISTER JAMES
William takes a step towards her.
WILLIAM
Sister, are we having the test

today?

SISTER JAMES
Tomorrow, William.

WILLIAM
Is it long division?

SISTER JAMES
Among other things.

(CONTINUED)
12.

Sister James turns away to greet another nun and William
grabs her arm to ask her another question.

SISTER JAMES
Good morning, Sister.

William touches her sleeve.

WILLIAM
How much of it will be long
division?

SISTER ALOYSIUS (0.S.)
Boy!

THE WHOLE SCHOOL STOPS AND LOOKS UP

Sister Aloysius looks down on the courtyard from the balcony
outside her office.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
William London. Come up here! Come
smartly now.
Pale and alone, William walks up the stairs.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Don’t make me wait.

FATHER FLYNN AND SISTER JAMES WATCH FROM BELOW
As two of the girls confer.

ALICE (0.S.)
What did he do?

SARAH (0.S.)
He touched Sister James.

Flynn confides to Sister James.

FLYNN
The dragon is hungry!

Sister James blushes with pleasure at the attention, stifles
a giggle. The noise resumes.

SARAH (0.S.)
You don’t touch a nun.
13.

INT. AN EMPTY HALLWAY IN THE SCHOOL - DAY

RAYMOND, a student, rings a big brass bell with relish. It
signals the start of the school day.

INT. SISTER JAMES’ CLASSROOM — DAY

The class is in session. There’s about 25 kids, half boys,
half girls. The girls are on one side of the class, the boys
on the other. The class has not totally settled down. There
are giggles and whispers.

SISTER JAMES
Take out your history books,
please. Turn to page 683.
RALPH raises his hand.

SISTER JAMES
Yes, Ralph.

RALPH
I forgot my history book.

SISTER JAMES
You can look on with Raymond. Mr.
London? Do you have your history
book?

WILLIAM
Uh, no, Sister.

SISTER JAMES
Share with Mr. Malloy, please.

WILLIAM
Do I have to? His breath stinks!

The class laughs.
SISTER JAMES
I’m sure Mr. Malloy’s breath is
just fine.

A door creaks.

SISTER ALOYSIUS IS ENTERING THE CLASS

(CONTINUED)
14.

She takes in that the class is noisy. The class stands.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Be seated.

SISTER JAMES
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the
thirty-second president of The
United States.

BACK TO SISTER ALOYSIUS, WHO SPEAKS TO NOREEN
SISTER ALOYSIUS

That barrette out of your hair,
Miss Horan.

Noreen takes a rhinestone barrette out of her hair.

NOREEN
Yes, Sister.

Sister Aloysius takes a position at the back of the class.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Morning, Sister James. Continue.

BACK TO SISTER JAMES WHO DOES CONTINUE

At first self-consciously, and then with increasing

confidence.

SISTER JAMES
Franklin D. Roosevelt, together
with Abraham Lincoln and John
Fitzgerald Kennedy, was perhaps our
greatest president. When he
assumed office, 13,000,000 people
in this country were unemployed.
They'd lost hope. And President
Roosevelt said to these people:
“The only thing we have to fear is
fear itself.” What did he mean by
that? James?

JIMMY
I think he was trying to say
there’s nothing really wrong, you
know? So don’t get so emotional.

SISTER ALOYSIUS LISTENING - SHE HAS RESERVATIONS

(CONTINUED)
15.

Sister Aloysius spots a wire coming out of a boy’s ear. It’s
TOMMY CONROY. She walks over, pulls the plug out of Conroy’s
ear.

SISTER JAMES (0.S.)
Maybe...Maybe he was saying that
the world is good and we need only
work together to overcome our
problems.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What’s this, Mr. Conroy?

TOMMY
I don’t know, Sister.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You don’t know you have a wire
coming out of your ear?

CONROY
No.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Huh? Huh?

CONROY
No, Sister. I didn’t.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You come with me, boy. Go.
(They leave)

SISTER JAMES
Who knows what the New Deal was?

INT. THE SCHOOL BASEMENT - CHOIR PRACTICE - DAY

Sister James is leading the CHOIR in singing THE FIRST NOEL.
She's very happy to be doing this. MRS. KEAN accompanies on a
portable electric organ. Sister Aloysius sits in the back
with SISTER RAYMOND.

SISTER RAYMOND
I love this song. (No response.)
16.

INT. THE CONVENT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

EIGHT NUNS sit around a rectangular table having dinner. No
one speaks. Sister Aloysius is at the head of the table. To
her right is a very old nun named SISTER VERONICA. To her
left is Sister James.

WE GO TO A SINGLE OF AN OLD WOMAN’S HAND

Softly feeling for a fork. The fork is lost underneath her
plate.

NOW WE SEE SISTER ALOYSIUS NOTICING SISTER VERONICA
Who is trying to find her fork without anyone seeing. Sister
Aloysius gently pushes the fork under Veronica’s hand so the
old woman finds it.
NOW WE GO TO SISTER JAMES TRYING TO EAT THE SALISBURY STEAK
She pulls an inedible piece out of her mouth and is about to
put it on her plate when she sees that Sister Aloysius is
watching her. She puts it back in her mouth.
SISTER ALOYSIUS RINGS A LITTLE BELL THAT’S BY HER
Then she addresses the table.
SISTER ALOYSIUS
This past Sunday. What do you think
that sermon was about?

Sister James is, with difficulty, swallowing.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Sister James.

SISTER JAMES
Huh?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What was Father Flynn’s sermon
about?

SISTER JAMES

Well, Doubt. He was talking about
Doubt?

(CONTINUED)
17.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Why?

SISTER JAMES
Excuse me, Sister?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Well, sermons come from somewhere,
don’t they? Is Father Flynn in
Doubt? Is he concerned that someone
else is in Doubt?

SISTER JAMES
I suppose you’d have to ask him.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No, that would not be appropriate.
He is my superior. And if he were
troubled, he should confess it to a
fellow priest, or to the Monsignor.
We do not share intimate
information with priests.

SISTER TERESA
No.

SISTER RAYMOND
That’s true.

SISTER VERONICA
What are we saying?

Silence falls again.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I want you all to be alert. I am
concerned, perhaps needlessly,
about, eh, matters in St. Nicholas
School.

SISTER RAYMOND asks timidly.

SISTER RAYMOND
Academically?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I was not inviting a guessing game,
Sister Raymond.

Sister Aloysius notices her napkin stirring. A breeze?
18.

INT. A CHANGING ROOM BEHIND THE ALTAR - DAY

Father Flynn walks in. He looks up at the stained glass eye.

EXT. WILLIAM LONDON OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL - DAY

He has a bloody handkerchief to his nose. He’s in a good
mood. He takes the handkerchief away. The nose has stopped
bleeding. He smiles. He lights a cigarette.

INT. A LARGE CAFETERIA WITH MANY TABLES AND WINDOWS - DAY

It has good natural light. The STUDENT BODY is having lunch.

INT. THE CAFETERIA - SISTER ALOYSIUS IS AT A TABLE - DAY
SISTER ALOYSIUS
Missy! Get away from her. And sit
down.

She sits with Sister Veronica, having a glass of water. She
washes down an aspirin. Sister Veronica is eating with gusto.

Sister James appears with a tray.

SISTER JAMES
May I join you, Sister Aloysius?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

Sister James seats herself. Her food is revolting but she
tries to hide that from her superior and herself.

SISTER JAMES
Chicken Chow Mein.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Sister Veronica’s favorite.

SISTER VERONICA
It’s very good.

SISTER TERESA

I like the noodles. I like the
crunch.

(CONTINUED)
19.

SISTER JAMES
What happened to William London?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I sent him home.

SISTER JAMES
Oh dear. So he’s still bleeding?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

SISTER JAMES
His nose just let loose and started
gushing during the Pledge of
Allegiance.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Was it spontaneous?

SISTER JAMES
What?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
His nosebleed.

SISTER JAMES
What else would it be?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Self-induced.

SISTER JAMES
You mean you think he might’ve
intentionally given himself a
nosebleed?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Exactly.

SISTER JAMES
No!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You are a very innocent person,
Sister James. William London is a
fidgety boy. If you do not keep
right on him, he will do anything
to escape his chair.

(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
20.

He would set his foot on fire for
half a day out of school.

She notices Sister Veronica’s sleeve has goo on it, dips a
napkin in water, and sets about cleaning it off.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Here. Sister, allow me to help
you. Your sleeve.

SISTER VERONICA
Uh-oh.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Mmm. Let’s see.

SISTER VERONICA
Oh thank you, Sister.

INT. ST. NICHOLAS SCHOOL - STAIRWELL - DAY
Sister Aloysius and Sister James walk up the stairs.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Sister Veronica is going blind.

SISTER JAMES
Oh how horrible!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
If they find out in the rectory,
she'll be gone. So, if she looks
unsteady, take her hand.

INT. CLASSROOM - SISTER ALOYSIUS AND SISTER JAMES ENTER - DAY

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Ordinarily, I assign my most
experienced teachers to eighth
grade, but I am working within
constraints.

She sits in Sister James’ chair. Her bones seem to hurt a
moment. She rummages through the desk drawers.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Are you in control of your class?

(CONTINUED)
21.

SISTER JAMES
I think so.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Usually more students are sent down
to me.

SISTER JAMES
I try to take care of things
myself.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That can be an error. You are
answerable to me, I to the
Monsignor, he to the Bishop, and so
on up to the Holy Father. There is
a chain. Make use of it. (Discovers
a small box. Inquires.) Candy?

SISTER JAMES
Cough drops.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Candy by another name.

Sister Aloysius throws the box in the wastebasket. She gets
up.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
How is Donald Miller doing?

SISTER JAMES
Steady.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Good.
(Points to a back corner
chair)
That girl...Noreen Horan.

SISTER JAMES
I’ve seated her as far away from
the boys as possible. Doesn’t do
much good.

Sister Aloysius has gone to Noreen’s desk and finds the

barrette; she examines it in the sunlight as if it’s a murder
weapon. She works it. It looks like little legs spreading.

(CONTINUED)
22.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Just get her through. Intact.

CUT TO AN OPEN WINDOW AS A GUST OF WIND PROPELS DEAD LEAVES

Into the classroom and on to the floor. Sister Aloysius goes
to the window and shuts it.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What’s this? The wind is
so...peripatetic this year. Is that
the word I want?
SISTER ALOYSIUS’ TIED-IN POV DOWN TO THE STREET

We faintly hear Father Flynn share convivial chat with the
OLD MONSIGNOR on the street.

MONSIGNOR
Wasn’t that a fine cut of beef for
dinner, Father Flynn?!
FLYNN
It was, Monsignor, very good.
Though I believe it was chicken.
MONSIGNOR
Was it a chicken? Yes, I guess it
was a chicken. It was very good.
The old man pats the younger man’s shoulder warmly.
After a moment, we hear a timid Sister James.

SISTER JAMES (0.S.)
Is something the matter?

SISTER ALOYSIUS (0.S.)
What?

SISTER JAMES (0.S.)
Is something the matter?

SISTER ALOYSIUS, WHO IS STILL STARING OUT THE WINDOW

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No. Why? Is something the matter?

SISTER JAMES
I don’t think so.

(CONTINUED)
23.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Well, then, nothing’s the matter
then.

Another silence. Sister James doesn’t know what to do.

SISTER JAMES
Yes.

The older nun picks something off the floor.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What’s this?

SISTER JAMES
A pen?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
A ballpoint pen. The students are
not using them for assignments, I
hope?

SISTER JAMES
No, of course not.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’m sorry I allowed even cartridge
pens into this school. Always the
easy way out these days. Every
easy choice today will have its
consequence tomorrow. Mark my
words.

Sister James picks up dead leaves.

SISTER JAMES
Yes, Sister.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Ballpoints make them press down,
when they press down, they write
like monkeys.

SISTER JAMES
I don’t allow them ballpoint pens.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

And yet here one is. Penmanship is
dying all across this country.

(CONTINUED)
24.

SISTER JAMES
I hope not.

Sister Aloysius starts to walk out and stops, examining the
top of the desk.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You should frame something. Put it
up on the blackboard. (Picking up
a framed photograph.) Put the Pope
up.

SISTER JAMES
That’s the wrong Pope. He’s
deceased.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I don’t care what Pope it is. Use
the glass to see behind you. The
children should think you have eyes
in the back of your head.

SISTER JAMES
Wouldn't that be a little
frightening?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Only to the ones who are up to no
good.

She goes.

INT. THE SCHOOL BASEMENT - LONDON AT THE FOUL LINE - DAY

FLYNN (0.S.)
Relax. Put it up there.

William shoots and misses.

FLYNN
All right, now.

Jimmy swaps positions and moves onto the foul line.

FLYNN
The thing about shooting from the
foul line (Points at Jimmy’s head.)
is it’s psychological. All right,
come up with a routine.

(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
25.

All right, shift your weight, move
your hips...

The boys laugh.

FLYNN
Hey, you think that’s funny, Ralph?
You know what’s funny is you never
getting a foul shot.

BOYS
Oooh.

FLYNN
All right, concentrate on the
routine, and you'll forget to get
tensed up. All right, go ahead,
Jimmy.

Jimmy shoots and gets it in. Smiles.

FLYNN
Good man. You listen. That’s good.
All right, now sit down. Everyone.
Good. On another matter,
I’ve noticed several of you guys
got dirty nails. All right, I don’t
want to see that. I’m not talking
about the length of your nails, I’m
talking about cleanliness. See?
Look at my nails.

CLOSE UP OF HIS EXTENDED HANDS - HIS NAILS ARE QUITE LONG AND
POLISHED

FLYNN (0.S.)
All right, they’re long, I like

them a little long, but look at how
clean they are. That makes it okay.

REACTION SHOT - WILLIAM LONDON DOESN'T LIKE THE NAILS

INT. THE RECTORY - THREE PRIESTS HAVING DINNER - NIGHT

The Monsignor, FATHER SHERMAN, and Flynn are eating a roast
and washing it down with red wine. Boisterous laughter. The
Monsignor is smoking a cigarette. The pack is on the table.
Pall Mall unfiltered.

(CONTINUED)
26.

FLYNN
The climpity-clomp. Clomp clomp
clomp. Harder than a herd of
elephants.

MONSIGNOR
You are wicked!

FLYNN
No, I told her, “You’re her mother!
You raised her, you fed her, YOU
tell her she’s fat!”

MONSIGNOR
Ooh!

FATHER SHERMAN
But wait, how fat is she?

FLYNN
What, the mother or the daughter?

FATHER SHERMAN
The daughter.

FLYNN
I never met the daughter.

FATHER SHERMAN
What about the mother?

FLYNN
Fat!!!

INT. THE CONVENT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Dinner’s in progress. The Nuns eat. Silence.

INT. THE CHURCH - A MASS IN PROGRESS - MORNING

Father Flynn is serving with Jimmy and Donald Miller as altar
boys. Flynn lifts the host and recites the blessing of the
Eucharist. Jimmy rings the bells.

(CONTINUED)
27.

FLYNN

INT. THE SACRISTY SEEN FROM THE DARKER CHANGING ROOM - DAY
Donald is in his school clothes. Dimly, in the distant

sacristy, Flynn can be seen talking with Jimmy. Donald dimly
hears Flynn and Jimmy talking.

JIMMY
Father, we having practice after
school?

FLYNN

If you guys want it, we can have
it. Let me know.

INT. SISTER JAMES’ CLASSROOM — DAY

William London sneaks across the back of the classroom and
whispers to Noreen Horan, and she giggles.

SISTER JAMES SEES THIS REFLECTED IN THE GLASS OF THE PHOTO
She speaks without turning.

SISTER JAMES

The Fascist governments of Germany
and Italy were already working
together. They formed the Pact of
Steel. The Pact of Steel was a
military alliance between Benito
Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Mister
London, get back in your seat and
stop bothering Miss Horan, please.

WILLIAM'S REACTION - HE’S SPOOKED THAT THE SISTER KNEW

BACK TO SISTER JAMES WHO SMILES AT HER LITTLE VICTORY

SISTER JAMES
Now, who can tell me - -

The intercom buzzes.
SISTER JAMES ANSWERING THE INTERCOM

We hear Flynn’s voice, but not what he’s saying. Sister James
replies.

SISTER JAMES
Yes? Yes. Of course, Father.

She gets off the intercom and turns to the class.

SISTER JAMES
Donald? You should go to the
Rectory.

INT. SCHOOL GYM/CAFETERIA - A DANCE CLASS IS IN PROGRESS -
DAY

MRS. SHIELDS is a middle-aged woman in a dress and silver tap
shoes. BLAME IT ON THE BOSSANOVA is on the record player.

MRS. SHIELDS
Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

They dance facing their partners. A few of the girls sing
along.

MRS. SHIELDS
Go one, two, three, touch. One,
two, three, kick. Back, side,
front, kick. Back, side, front...

Raymond is doing the mashed potato. Mrs. Shields moves to
him.

MRS. SHIELDS
Raymond, what are you doing?

RAYMOND
The mashed potato.

MRS. SHIELDS

You're supposed to be doing the
bossa nova.

(CONTINUED)
29.

RAYMOND
But I know the mashed potato.

MRS. SHIELDS
(laughs) All right, now follow.
Back, side, front, kick. Back,
side, one, two, three, kick. Back,
side, front, kick. Back, side,
front. Okay. Let me get in front
of you so that you can see what I’m
doing.

SISTER JAMES IS SITTING ON A FOLDING CHAIR WATCHING

Amused. She claps lightly. Then she sees something.

SISTER JAMES’ POV - SOME LOCKERS - FLYNN APPEARS

He is somewhat furtive. He has something white in his hand.
He opens a locker and puts the white thing in. It’s fabric.
He sees Sister James and smiles. He takes a sip of water
from the drinking fountain and goes back upstairs.

SISTER JAMES SLOWLY WALKING TOWARDS THE LOCKERS

She goes to the locker. She opens it, a boy’s white T-shirt.
She returns it to the locker puzzled.

INT. THE HALLWAY - SISTER JAMES’ STUDENTS LEAVING - DAY

INT. SISTER JAMES’ CLASSROOM - DAY

Jimmy’s got his school bag. Others are heading out. He looks
at Sister James, who is intently talking to one of the
students.

JIMMY’S POV - SISTER JAMES’ BACK

Her habit obscures the identity of the student she’s talking
to. Sister James leans down towards the unseen boy’s face.

SISTER JAMES
Donald, are you feeling ill?

DONALD (UNSEEN)
No.

(CONTINUED)
30.

SISTER JAMES
You sure? Are you all right?

BACK TO JIMMY LOOKING AS HE GOES
A shadow passes over his expression.

BACK TO JIMMY’S POV of SISTER JAMES’ BACK

EXT. WITHIN THE GARDEN - SOME ROSE BUSHES - DAY

Sister James comes out of the convent. Sister Aloysius is
unrolling burlap. Sister James sees her and walks over.

SISTER JAMES
Good afternoon, Sister.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Good afternoon, Sister James.

SISTER JAMES
Sister, can I speak with you about
Donald Miller?
Sister Aloysius rolls the barrow onto a path. Sister James
follows.

EXT. AN OLD UTILITY SHED AS SISTER ALOYSIUS OPENS IT - DAY
Accompanied by Sister James.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Is he being accepted?

SISTER JAMES
He has no friends.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That would be a lot to expect after
only two months. Has anyone hit
him?

(CONTINUED)
31.

SISTER JAMES
No.

INT. THE SHED AS THEY ENTER WITH THE BARROW - DAY

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Someone will. And when that
happens, send them right down to
me.

Sister Aloysius stows the contents of the barrow in the shed
as Sister James continues.

SISTER JAMES
I’m not so sure anyone will.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
This parish serves Irish and
Italian families. Someone will hit
Donald Miller.

SISTER JAMES
He has a protector.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Who?

SISTER JAMES
Father Flynn.

A CLOSE UP OF SISTER ALOYSIUS - SUDDENLY VERY ALERT
She turns to face Sister James.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What?

Sister James becomes elaborately casual.

SISTER JAMES
He’s taken an interest.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

I told you to come to me, but I
hoped you never would.

(CONTINUED)
32.

SISTER JAMES
Maybe I shouldn’t have.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
So it’s happened.

SISTER JAMES
What!? Oh, no. I’m not telling you
that! I’m not even certain what
you mean.

MR. MCGUINN throws open the rear door, startling them. He’s
putting away the garden hose.

MCGUINN
Oh excuse me there, Sisters!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No bother we’re done here! Come,
Sister.

They start to go.

INT. THE CONVENT FOYER - DAY

Sister Aloysius is hustling Sister James through the door.
Stops in shadow and asks.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What have you seen?

SISTER JAMES
It is unsettling to look at people
with suspicion. I feel less close
to God.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
When you take a step to address
wrongdoing, you are taking a step
away from God, but in His service.
What have you seen?

The housekeeper, Mrs. Carson appears with a cat.

MRS. CARSON
Good afternoon, Sisters!

(CONTINUED)
33.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson. Why
the cat?

MRS. CARSON
Because there’s a mouse. Want some
tea?
INT. THE RECTORY - THE DINING ROOM - DAY
Flynn has the BOYS arrayed around the table.
FLYNN

If you don’t want to dance with
her, don’t dance with her.

JIMMY
Well, is it wrong?
FLYNN
No.
CONROY
But what if the girl turns you
down?
FLYNN

All right, you have the right to
ask a girl to dance. All right,
she has the right to turn you down.
The trick is don’t take it to
heart.

RALPH
What if they ALL turn you down?

FLYNN
Well, then you become a priest.

They all laugh. Jimmy is thoughtful. Raymond raises his
hand and Flynn calls on him.

FLYNN
All right, next question.

INT. THE CONVENT’S BLUE SITTING ROOM - THE TWO NUNS - DAY

(CONTINUED)
34.

Sister James is seated. Sister Aloysius is closing the door.
SISTER ALOYSIUS
What have you seen?

SISTER JAMES
He called Donald Miller to the

Rectory.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What for?

SISTER JAMES
A talk.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Alone?

SISTER JAMES
Yes.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
When?

SISTER JAMES
A week ago, during class.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Why didn’t you tell me?

SISTER JAMES
I didn’t think there was anything
wrong with it.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Of all the children. Donald Miller.
I suppose it makes sense.

SISTER JAMES
How does it make sense?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
He’s isolated.

SISTER JAMES

I don’t know that anything is
wrong!

(CONTINUED)
35.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Our first Negro student. I thought
there would be fighting. A parent
or two to deal with. I should have
foreseen this possibility.

SISTER JAMES
How could you imagine it?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Well, it’s my job to outshine the
fox in cleverness. That is my job!

SISTER JAMES
But maybe it’s nothing!

Sister Aloysius sits next to her.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Then why do you look like you've
seen the Devil?

SISTER JAMES
It’s just the way the boy acted
when he came back to class.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
He said something?

SISTER JAMES

No. It was his expression. He
looked frightened and... he put his
head on the desk in the most
peculiar way. And...

(Struggles)
And one other thing. I think there
was alcohol on his breath. There
WAS alcohol on his breath.

Sister Aloysius puts a consoling hand on Sister James’ hand.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Years ago at St. Boniface there was
a priest... But I had Father Scully
then. Here there’s no man I can go
to, men run everything. We are
going to have to stop him
ourselves.

Mrs. Carson barges in with the dead mouse in a napkin.

(CONTINUED)
36.

MRS. CARSON
There we go! She got him! It takes
a cat.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes it does. Yes it does.
EXT. ST. NICHOLAS SCHOOL - DAY
Children exiting the school as a storm gathers.

CUT TO:

INT. SISTER JAMES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

There’s a storm raging outside. Wind and rain. She tries to
sleep, but a tree branch claws the window.

INT. THE CONVENT KITCHEN - SISTER ALOYSIUS - MORNING

She is lifting a kettle off the gas range as a commotion out
in the hall catches her attention.

MRS. CARSON
This towel will never be dead white
again.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes it will.

Sister Raymond is helping Sister Veronica to her room.

SISTER RAYMOND (0.S.)
Mrs. Carson!

SISTER VERONICA (0.S.)
I’m fine.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What happened?

SISTER RAYMOND
There’s a branch down.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

(To Veronica.)
Are you alright, Sister?

(CONTINUED)
37.

SISTER RAYMOND
She didn’t see it.

SISTER VERONICA
I’m fine. Just bushwhacked. No need
for a fuss.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You just go lie down. I'll bring
you some tea.

Sister Aloysius is beleaguered, but not alarmed. She unhooks
the intercom.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
(On intercom. )
Come on. Mister McGuinn? Could you
look in on the courtyard? A branch
has fallen. A branch has - -!
(slams down receiver)

EXT. THE CONVENT STEPS - MORNING

Mr. McGuinn is tugging at the fallen branch, which is large.
Sister Aloysius comes out with a pot of tea in a towel and
steps around the situation.

MCGUINN
Watch your step here, Sister. I'll
cut it up.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
The world is crashing, Michael.

MCGUINN
I haven't heard a wind like that
since I left Mullingar!
SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’ve never known a wind like it.
The wind has changed.
She goes on as he tugs.

INT. THE ENTRANCE DOOR TO THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

A bench outside this door. The boy, Conroy, sits.
Flynn joins him.

FLYNN
What are you doing out here,
Conroy?

CONROY

I talked in class, Father.

FLYNN
Waiting for Sister Aloysius. She
know you’re here?

CONROY
She knows.

Father

The door opens suddenly. It’s Sister Aloysius. The men stand.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Good morning, Father Flynn. Good of
you to come by.

FLYNN
Good morning, Sister Aloysius. How
are you today?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’m very well, thank you. (Shifts
attention.) Mister Conroy.

CONROY
Yes, Sister.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Mister Transistor Radio.
Multiplication table ten times in
its totality delivered to me
tomorrow morning. Legible, Boy!
Return to class. Go. Go, go.

Conroy, miserable, goes. Sister Aloysius addresses Flynn.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I'd invite you in, but we’re just
short Sister James. Hear that wind
last night?

(CONTINUED)
39.

FLYNN
I certainly did!

Conversation dries up.

FLYNN
Did I hear Sister Veronica had an
accident?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes, Sister Veronica fell and
practically killed herself.

FLYNN
Is she alright?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh, she’s fine.

FLYNN
Her sight isn’t good, is it?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
(Lying)
Her sight is fine. Nuns fall, you
know.

FLYNN
Nah, I didn’t know that.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
It’s the habit. It catches us up
more often than not. We go down
like dominoes.

Sister James appears, running down the hall.

SISTER JAMES
Am I past the time?

FLYNN
Not at all.

SISTER JAMES
Good morning, Father. Good morning,
Sister. I’m sorry I was delayed. I
ran into Sister Veronica.

FLYNN
How is she?

(CONTINUED)
40.

SISTER JAMES
I’m afraid she has a bit of a
bloody nose.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’m beginning to think you're
punching people.

SISTER JAMES
Sister?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
First William London and now ...
Never mind. Well, come in, please.

FLYNN
Sister...

INT. THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY
Sister Aloysius is at the door.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Please. Sit. Have a seat.

They come in.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I actually have a hot pot of tea.
(Closes the door but for an inch.)
And close this but not quite for
form's sake. Father, would you care
for a...

Sister Aloysius is offering Flynn a chair, but he doesn’t
notice. He sits in Sister Aloysius’ chair, at her desk.
She’s taken aback, but recovers quickly.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Would you have a cup of tea,
Father?

FLYNN
I would love a cup of tea.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

Sister, perhaps you could serve
him?

(CONTINUED)
41.

SISTER JAMES
I’d be glad.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
And yourself, of course.

SISTER JAMES
Would you like a cup of tea, Sister
Aloysius?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No, I’ve already had my cup.

FLYNN
Is there sugar?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Sugar? Yes! (Goes to her desk,
rummages in a drawer.) Yes. It’s
somewhere here. I put it in the
drawer for Lent last year and never
remembered to take it out.

FLYNN
(Winking at Sister James)
Ah, it mustn’t have been much to
give up then.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’m sure you’re right. Here it is.
I’ll serve you, though for want of
practice, I’m, I’m a little clumsy.

She's come to him with the sugar bowl. She’s poised over him
with a lump of sugar in a small pair of tongs.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I see your fingernails.

SISTER ALOYSIUS’ POV - FLYNN’S LONG NAILS

SISTER JAMES SIPS HER TEA, WATCHING THE TWO OF THEM

BACK TO SISTER ALOYSIUS FROZEN IN THE ACT OF SERVING FLYNN

FLYNN
I wear them a little long. The
sugar?

(CONTINUED)
42.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

Yes. One?

FLYNN
Three.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Three?

She's appalled and tries to hide it.

FLYNN
Sweet tooth.

She digs at the sugar because the cubes have melded together.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
One. Two. Three. Sister, you care
for sugar?

SISTER JAMES
Never! (Gently, to Flynn.) Not that
there’s anything wrong with sugar.

Sister Aloysius puts the sugar away in her desk.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Well, thank you, Father, for making
time for us. We are at our wit’s
end.

FLYNN
Well, I think it’s an excellent
idea to rethink the Christmas
pageant. ‘Cause last year’s effort
was a little woebegone.

SISTER JAMES
Oh, I loved it! But I love all
pageants. The hymns! O Little Town
of Bethlehem, O Come O Come
Emmanuel, O Come All Ye Faithful - -

SISTER ALOYSIUS
All right. Thank you, Sister
James! So what do you think,
Father? Is there something new we
could do?

(CONTINUED)
43.

FLYNN
Well, we all love the Christmas
hymns, but it might be jolly to
include a secular song.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Secular?

FLYNN
Yes. IT’S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT
LIKE CHRISTMAS. Something like
that.

Sister Aloysius gets up.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What would be the point of a
secular song?

FLYNN
Just fun.

SISTER JAMES
Or FROSTY THE SNOWMAN.

FLYNN
That’s a good one. We could have
one of the boys dress as a snowman
and dance around.

Sister Aloysius flips the blinds. A shaft of sunlight blazes
on the priest.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Which boy?

FLYNN
(Squinting)
We'd do tryouts.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
FROSTY THE SNOWMAN espouses a pagan
belief in magic. The snowman comes
to life when an enchanted hat is
put on his head. If the music were
more somber, people would realize
the images are disturbing and the
song heretical.

Sister James and Father Flynn exchange a look.

(CONTINUED)
44,

SISTER JAMES
I’ve never thought about Frosty The
Snowman like that.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Well, it should be banned from the
airwaves.

FLYNN
So. Not FROSTY THE SNOWMAN.

He writes something in a small notebook.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh, IT’S BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE - -
A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS would be fine,
I suppose. Parents would like it.
May I ask what you’re writing down?
With that ballpoint pen?

FLYNN
Oh. Nothing. It’s an idea for a
sermon.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You had one right now?

FLYNN
I get them all the time.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
How fortunate.

FLYNN
I forget them so I have to write
them down.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh. What is the idea?

FLYNN
Intolerance.

Sister James tries to break the tension.
SISTER JAMES

Would you like a little more tea,
Father?

(CONTINUED)
45.

FLYNN
Not yet. (To Sister Aloysius) It’s
a new time, Sister.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What’s new about it?

FLYNN
Something inside of people is new.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
There is nothing new under the sun.

FLYNN
The Church needs to change. We
should sing a song from the radio
now and then. Take the kids out for
ice cream.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Sweet tooth.

FLYNN
Maybe take the boys on a camping
trip.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
The point being?

FLYNN
We should be friendlier. You know,
the children and the parents should
see us as members of their family.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
But we are not members of their
family. We’re different.

FLYNN
Why? Because of our vows?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Precisely.

FLYNN
I don’t think we're so different.
You know, Sister, I would take some
more tea.

Flynn gets up. Sister James gets up.

(CONTINUED)
46.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
And they think we’re different,
yeah? The working class people of
this parish trust us to be
different.

Flynn flips the blinds closed.

FLYNN
I think we’re getting off the
subject.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes, you’re right. You're right.
Back to it.

The wall intercom rings. She answers it.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes, Sister Raymond? (Listens.)
Well you tell her to wash her face
and her neck and report to me at
three.

She hangs up.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
(turning on the desk lamp)
Excuse me. The Christmas pageant.
We must be careful how Donald
Miller is used in the pageant.

Sister James shakes as she pours the tea, spilling a little.

FLYNN
Easy there, Sister.

SISTER JAMES
Oh, uh, yes, Father.

FLYNN
All right, what about Donald
Miller?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
We must be careful, in the pageant,
that we neither hide Donald Miller
nor put him forward.

(CONTINUED)
47.

FLYNN
Because of the color of his skin?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That's right, yeah.

FLYNN
Why?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh come, Father.

FLYNN
I think he should be treated like
every other boy.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Well, you yourself singled the boy
out for special attention. You held
a private meeting with him at the
Rectory. (Shooting a look at Sister
James) A week ago?

SISTER JAMES
Yes.

Flynn picks a lemon drop out of the bag.

FLYNN
What are we talking about?

SISTER JAMES
Donald Miller?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
The boy acted strangely when he
returned to class.

The priest turns to Sister James, popping a lemon drop in his
mouth.

FLYNN
He did?

SISTER JAMES
When he returned from the Rectory.
A little odd, yes.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Can you tell us why?

(CONTINUED)
48.

FLYNN
How did he act strangely?

SISTER JAMES
He...I’m not sure how to explain
it. He...he laid his head on the
desk, and he...some...

FLYNN
Do you mean you had some
impression?

SISTER JAMES
Yes.

FLYNN
And he’d come from the Rectory so
you're asking me?

SISTER ALOYSIUS

Hmmm.

SISTER JAMES
That’s it.

FLYNN
Mmhmmm.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Hmmm.

FLYNN
Mm-hmmm. Hmmm. Did you want to
discuss the pageant, is that why
I’m here, or is this what you
wanted to discuss?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
This.

FLYNN
Well. I’m a little uncomfortable.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Why?

FLYNN
Why do you think?

(CONTINUED)
49.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
The boy’s well-being is my
responsibility.
The phone rings.

FLYNN
His well-being is not at issue.

DUTCH ANGLE OF PHONE ON SISTER ALOYSIUS’ DESK
It rings. She doesn’t answer it.
SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’m not satisfied that that is
true. He was upset when he returned
to class.

FLYNN
Did he say something?

SISTER JAMES
No.

DUTCH ANGLE SHOT OF ALL THREE

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What happened in the Rectory?

FLYNN
Happened?
SISTER ALOYSIUS
Mmmhmm.
FLYNN
Nothing happened. I had a talk with
the boy.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What about?

FLYNN
Private matter.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
He’s twelve years old. What could
be private?

BACK TO STRAIGHT ANGLE SHOTS

(CONTINUED)
50.

SISTER JAMES
Should I get the phone--?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
(overlaps)
No.

FLYNN
I object to your tone.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
This is not about my tone... or
your tone, Father Flynn. It’s about
arriving at the truth.

The phone stops ringing.

FLYNN
Of what?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You know what I’m talking about.
Don’t you? You’re controlling the
expression on your face right now.
Aren't you?

FLYNN
My face? What exactly are you
accusing me of?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I am not accusing you of anything,
Father Flynn. I am asking you to
tell me what happened in the
Rectory.

FLYNN

I don’t wish to continue this. And
if you're dissatisfied with that, I
suggest you speak to Monsignor
Benedict. I can only imagine this
unfortunate behavior is the result
of overwork. Have a good morning.
Sister. (To Sister James) Sister.

Flynn heads for the door.
51.

INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY
Sister Aloysius follows him to the door. What she says stops

him.
SISTER ALOYSIUS

There was alcohol on his breath.

Flynn turns.
SISTER ALOYSIUS

When he returned from his meeting
with you.
FLYNN

Alcohol.
SISTER JAMES
I did smell it on his breath.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Well?
FLYNN

Let this alone.
SISTER ALOYSIUS

No.
A bell rings. Students start coming down the stairs.

INT. THE OFFICE AS FLYNN STANDS AT THE DOOR - DAY

He is pensive, troubled. He closes the door.

SISTER JAMES
Take your time, Father. Would you

like some more tea?

FLYNN
You should’ve let it alone.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

Not possible.
Sister Aloysius backs away from him. Sister James sits down.

(CONTINUED)
52.

FLYNN
Mr. McGuinn caught Donald drinking
altar wine. When I found out, I
sent for him. There were tears. And
he begged not to be removed from
the altar boys. I took pity on him.
I told him if no one else found
out, I would let him stay on.

Sister James leaps to her feet, overjoyed.

SISTER JAMES
Oh, what a relief! That explains
everything! Thanks be to God! Look,
Sister, it was all a mistake!

Sister Aloysius is unmoved.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?

FLYNN
Oh, talk to him by all means. But
now that the boy’s secret’s out,
I’m going to have to remove him
from the altar boys. That’s what I
was trying to avoid.

SISTER JAMES
You were trying to protect the boy!

FLYNN
That’s right.

SISTER JAMES
I might have done the same thing!
(To Sister Aloysius) Is there a way
Donald could stay on the altar
boys?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
If the boy drank altar wine, he
can’t continue as an altar boy.

FLYNN
Of course. Are you satisfied?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

(CONTINUED)
53.

FLYNN
Hmmm. Well, I’1l be going. I have
some writing to do.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Intolerance.

FLYNN
That's right. I’m not pleased with
how you handled this, Sister.
Sister.

He goes.
Sister James weakly launches into optimism.

SISTER JAMES
Well. What a relief! He cleared it
all up.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You believe him?

SISTER JAMES
Of course.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Isn't it that it’s easier to
believe him?

SISTER JAMES
But we can corroborate his story
with Mr. McGuinn.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Mmm...hmm. Yes. These types of
people are clever.

SISTER JAMES
Well, I’m convinced!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You're not. You just want things to
be resolved so you can have
simplicity back.

SISTER JAMES
I want no further part of this.

(CONTINUED)
54.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I'll bring him down.

SISTER JAMES
How can you be so sure that he is
lying?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Experience.

SISTER JAMES
You just don’t like him! You don’t
like it that he uses a ballpoint
pen. You don’t like it that he
takes three lumps of sugar in his
tea. You don’t like it that he
likes FROSTY THE SNOWMAN. And
you're letting that convince you of
something terrible, just terrible!
Well, I like FROSTY THE SNOWMAN!
And I think it would be nice if
this school weren’t run like a
jail! And I think it’s a good thing
I love to teach History and that I
might inspire my students to love
it, too! And if you judge that to
mean that I’m not fit to be a
teacher, then so be it!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Sit down.

Sister James immediately complies. The light bulb over her
head flashes and goes out.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

Look at that. You blew out my
light. In ancient Sparta, important
matters were decided by who shouted
loudest. Fortunately, we are not in
ancient Sparta. You honestly find
the students in this school to be
treated like inmates in a prison?

SISTER JAMES
No. Actually, they all seem fairly
happy. But they’re all uniformly
terrified of you!

(CONTINUED)
55.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes. That’s how it works.

Sister Aloysius looks up a phone number on an index card.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Sit there.

She dials a number. Speaks into the phone.
SISTER ALOYSIUS
Hello, this is Sister Aloysius
Beauvier, principal at St. Nicholas
School. Is this Mrs. Miller? I’m
calling about your son, Donald.

EXT. PARISHIONERS COMING INTO CHURCH - DAY

It’s raining a bit. Umbrellas.

INT. THE CHURCH AS FATHER FLYNN GIVES HIS SERMON - DAY
MASTER SHOT OF CONGREGATION
FLYNN
A woman was gossiping with a friend
about a man she hardly knew-- I
know none of you have ever done
this--
REACTION OF PARISHIONERS CHUCKLING
BACK TO FLYNN IN CLOSEUP
FLYNN
--that night she had a dream. A
great hand appeared over her and
pointed down at her.
JIMMY IS SERVING AS ALTAR BOY
It’s a story and he likes stories.
BACK TO FLYNN
FLYNN
She was immediately seized with an

overwhelming sense of guilt.
(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
56.

The next day she went to
confession.

She got the old parish priest,
Father O’Rourke, and she told him
the whole thing. “Is gossiping a
sin?” she asked the old man. “Was
that the hand of God Almighty
pointing a finger at me?

CUT TO SISTER ALOYSIUS SEATED AMONG CONGREGATION

FLYNN (0.S.)
“Should I be asking your
absolution? Father, tell me, have
I done something wrong?”
(Irish Brogue)
“Yes!” Father O’Rourke answered
her.

CUT TO SISTER JAMES

FLYNN (0.S.)
“Yes, you ignorant, badly brought-—
up female! You have borne false
witness against your neighbor, you
have played fast and loose with his
reputation, and you should be
heartily ashamed!”

BACK TO FLYNN AT PULPIT

FLYNN
So the woman said she was sorry and
asked for forgiveness. “Not so
fast!” says O’Rourke. “I want you
to go home, take a pillow up on
your roof, cut it open with a
knife, and return here to me!”

cuT TO JIMMY

FLYNN (0.S.)
So the woman went home, took a
pillow off her bed, a knife from
the drawer, went up the fire escape
to the roof, and stabbed the
pillow.

BACK TO FLYNN

(CONTINUED)
57.

FLYNN
Then she went back to the old
parish priest as instructed.
“Did you gut the pillow with the

knife?” he says.”Yes, Father.” “And
what was the result?” “Feathers,”
she said.

EXT. ALLEY - VIEW FROM ROOFTOP - DAWN
A world of feathers.
FLYNN (V.O.)
“Feathers?” he repeated. “Feathers
everywhere, Father!”
THE ROOF - MRS. DEAKINS WITH A SPENT PILLOW - DAWN
She's watching the feathers flying away on the breeze.
FLYNN (V.O.)
“Now I want you to go back and
gather up every last feather that
flew out on the wind!”
CUT TO SISTER JAMES
FLYNN (0.S.)
“Well,” she said, “it can’t be
done. I don’t know where they went.
The wind took them all over.”
BACK TO FLYNN
FLYNN
"And that,” said Father O’Rourke,
“is gossip!”
INT. THE CHURCH AS FATHER FLYNN BLESSES HIMSELF
FLYNN
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, Amen.

FLYNN (0.S.)
Please rise.

Sister James turning back to look at Sister Aloysius.

EXT. THE ROOF - DAWN
Feathers fly away into the morning light.

The sound of a breeze.

EXT. THE GARDEN - DAY

A CROW CAWS.

We start on a letter and find Sister James, who sits brooding
on a bench. She puts the envelope away, hears the crow caw,
and looks up.

SINGLE OF A CROW ON A BRANCH EYEING HER

BACK TO SISTER JAMES LOOKING UP AT THE BIRD

The voice of Father Flynn makes her look around.

FLYNN (0.S.)
What’s that bird complaining about?

NOW WE SEE FLYNN AND SISTER JAMES
FLYNN
What kind of bird is that? That a
starling? A grackle?

SISTER JAMES
A crow.

FLYNN
‘Course it is. Are you praying? I
didn’t mean to interrupt.

SISTER JAMES
I’m not praying, no.

FLYNN
You seem subdued.

(CONTINUED)
59.

SISTER JAMES
Oh. I can’t sleep.

FLYNN
Why not?

SISTER JAMES
Bad dreams.

FLYNN
Yeah, I can’t sleep on occasion.

SISTER JAMES
Why? Do you see that big hand
pointing a finger at you?

FLYNN
Yes. Sometimes.

SISTER JAMES
Was your sermon directed at anyone
in particular?

FLYNN
What do you think?

Flynn lights a cigarette.

SISTER JAMES
I received a letter from my brother
in Maryland. He’s very sick.

FLYNN
Then maybe you should go and see
him.

SISTER JAMES
I can’t leave my class.

ALTERNATING SINGLE SHOTS - DUTCH ANGLE SHOT FROM BELOW:
Flynn smokes his cigarette.

SISTER JAMES
Is it true?

FLYNN
What?

(CONTINUED)
60.

SISTER JAMES
You know what I’m asking.

FLYNN
No.

SISTER JAMES
I saw you put an undershirt in
Donald Miller's locker.

FLYNN
He left it in the sacristy.

SISTER JAMES
Why didn’t you hand it to him?

FLYNN
I’m trying to spare him further
embarrassment.

Sister James shakes her head

BACK TO STRAIGHT ANGLES

FLYNN
(moves next to her on the bench)
It’s me that cares about that
child, not her. Has she ever
reached out a hand? That black boy
needs help or he’s not going to
make it! If she has her way, he’ll
be left to his own undoing. Why do
you think he drank the wine? He’s
in trouble! And she sees me talk in
a human way to these kids and she
immediately assumes that there must
be something wrong with it. Well,
I’m not going to let her keep this
parish in the dark ages! And I’m
not going to let her destroy my
spirit of compassion!

SISTER JAMES
I’m sure that’s not her intent.

FLYNN

That I care about this
congregation!

(CONTINUED)
61.

SISTER JAMES
I know you do.

FLYNN
Like you care about your class! You
love them, don’t you?

SISTER JAMES
Yes.

FLYNN
And that’s natural. How else would
you relate to children? That I can
look at your face and know your
philosophy. It’s kindness.

SISTER JAMES
I don’t know. I mean, of course.

FLYNN
There are people who go after your
humanity, Sister, that tell you the
light in your heart is a weakness.
Don’t believe it. It’s an old
tactic of cruel people to kill
kindness in the name of virtue.
There’s nothing wrong with love.

SISTER JAMES
Love?

FLYNN
Have you forgotten the message of
our Savior? It’s love of people.

SISTER JAMES
I just feel as if everything is
upside down.

FLYNN
There are just times in life when
we feel lost. It happens.

SISTER JAMES
And it’s a bond. Flowers.

INSERT - FATHER FLYNN HAS PRESSED FLOWERS IN HIS BIBLE

FLYNN
To remind me of Spring.

SISTER JAMES
I should be going.

FLYNN
I’m sorry your brother’s ill.

SISTER JAMES
Thank you, Father.

She heads for the path, stops.

SISTER JAMES
I don’t believe it!

FLYNN
You don’t?

SISTER JAMES

No.

FLYNN
Thank you, Sister. Thank you very
much.

INT. A SCHOOL HALLWAY - STUDENTS GO BY - DAY

Father Flynn is in the hallway reading a folded copy of The
Daily News. Sports scores. He spots Father Sherman in a
vestibule and they share a laugh. Noreen Horan approaches
him.

NOREEN
Father, I think I’ve just got to
tell somebody.

FLYNN
Hello, Noreen.
NOREEN
I’m in love.
FLYNN
That’s wonderful. Who’s the lucky
boy?
NOREEN

Jimmy Hurley.

(CONTINUED)
63.

FLYNN
Have you told him?

She shakes her head. Flynn sees Jimmy and looks in his
direction.

FLYNN
Maybe you should.

NOREEN
Maybe I will, Father.

She turns off Flynn’s look and goes after Jimmy.

NOREEN (0.S.)
Jimmy! Jimmy Hurley!

Flynn follows her progress towards Jimmy and sees Donald.
Flynn decides to dodge the boy, calls out to Father Sherman
and ducks into the vestibule.

FLYNN
Father Sherman...

Donald stands there a moment confused and disappointed.
DONALD MILLER PASSES WILLIAM LONDON IN THE HALLWAY.

William purposefully dumps Donald’s schoolbag and its
contents. Donald stops.

WILLIAM
You dropped something.

Kids are stepping on Donald’s stuff as he gathers his things.
He looks up. Father Flynn is offering his hand. Helps him
up. Embraces the boy.

FLYNN
It’s all right.

Sister James looks on.
INT. SISTER JAMES’ CLASS - DAY

Sister James is in a very bad mood. Some of the Kids are
laughing. She snaps.

(CONTINUED)
SISTER JAMES
Okay. Be quiet. I said be quiet!

The class gets quiet.

SISTER JAMES
The next one of you that speaks out
of turn gets sent right to the
Principal! Now the question was:
What was Patrick Henry’s famous
remark?

Jimmy raises his hand. She ignores it.

SISTER JAMES
Donald.

Now we go to Donald, who wasn’t listening.

DONALD
Sister?

SISTER JAMES
What was the question? Nobody help
him. Jimmy, put your hand down.
Jimmy puts his hand down.

SISTER JAMES
Donald Miller, stand up.

Donald stands.

SISTER JAMES
What was the question, Donald?

DONALD
I don’t know, Sister.

SISTER JAMES
That means you weren’t listening.

DONALD
Yes, Sister.

SISTER JAMES
The question was: What was Patrick
Henry’s famous remark?

DONALD
I don’t know.

Jimmy can’t stand it anymore and blurts out.

JIMMY
Give me liberty or give me death!

SISTER JAMES
James Hurley, down to the
Principal’s office now!

INT. SISTER ALOYSIUS IN HER OFFICE - OVERCAST DAY

She's wielding a long pole which is for changing light bulbs.
She has removed the old bulb and is screwing in a new one.
Her intercom rings. She doesn’t hear it. It rings again. No
reaction. Then knocking at her door, but she’s unaware. More
knocking. The bulb lights and she senses something. She goes
to the door still carrying the pole. She opens the door to
reveal MRS. MILLER, who is in her Sunday best, carrying an
umbrella.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Mrs. Miller?

MRS. MILLER
Yes.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

Huh? Oh. Well, just between us, I
was listening to a transistor radio
with an earpiece.

the woman a for-the-era small transistor radio.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Look how tiny they’re makin’ ‘em.
I confiscated it from one of the
students, now I can’t stop
listening to it.

MRS. MILLER
You like music?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No. News reports. Years ago I used
to listen to all the news reports
because my husband was in Italy in
the war.

MRS. MILLER
You were a married woman?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes. But then he was killed. Is
your husband coming?

MRS. MILLER
Couldn’t get off work. I only have
a half an hour myself.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I see. Of course. It was a lot to
ask.

MRS. MILLER
How’s Donald doing?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
He’s passing his subjects. He has
average grades.

MRS. MILLER

Hmm. Good. He was upset about
getting taken off the altar boys.

(CONTINUED)
67.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Did he explain why?

MRS. MILLER
He said he was caught drinking
altar wine.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That is the reason.

MRS. MILLER
Well, that seems fair. But he’s a
good boy, Sister. He fell down
there, but he’s a good boy pretty
much down the line.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
How is he at home?

MRS. MILLER
His father beat the hell out of him
over that wine.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh, he shouldn’t do that!

MRS. MILLER
You don’t tell my husband what to
do. You just stand back. My husband
didn’t want Donald to come here.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Why?

MRS. MILLER
He thought he'd have trouble with
the other boys. But that hasn’t
really happened.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Good.

MRS. MILLER
That priest, Father Flynn, been
watching out for him.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

A knock comes at the door.

Excuse me.

She goes to the door, opens it.

INT. OUTSIDE THE PRINCIPAL'S DOOR - JIMMY STANDS - DAY

The door opens. He’s facing Sister Aloysius.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

James Hurley, what are you doing

out of class?

JIMMY
Sister James sent me down.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What for?

JIMMY
Talking.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

Well, go back up and shut up!

go!

Go,

Jimmy's shocked. Jimmy sees past Sister Aloysius to Mrs.
Miller. Flynn appears behind Jimmy. Sister Aloysius sees him

and shuts the door.

None of your business! Go on!

JIMMY

Bullshit.

Go

FLYNN
What’d you say?

JIMMY
Nothing.

Jimmy, hurt, starts up the hallway. Flynn lingers, looks at
the office door, uncertain.

BACK TO SISTER ALOYSIUS AND MRS. MILLER IN THE OFFICE
Sister Aloysius wants to get away from Flynn.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You have twenty minutes you say?

MRS. MILLER
It’s just that I have to walk to
work.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Where is work?

MRS. MILLER
Parkchester. If I don’t start
cleaning by noon, I’m not home to
let Donald in.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
May I walk with you?

MRS. MILLER
I don’t mind.
INT. SISTER JAMES’ CLASSROOM - DAY
Sister James is doing a math problem on the board.
SISTER JAMES

tell me what the common denominator

is? Nobody?

At this moment, Jimmy comes in the door and heads for his
seat.

SISTER JAMES
Back already, Mr. Hurley? (He
doesn’t answer. She repeats
harshly.) I said, back already, Mr.
Hurley?!

JIMMY

Leave me alone.

BACK TO SISTER JAMES REACTS

SISTER JAMES
Who do you think you’re talking to?
This is my classroom, Boy. Don’t
you forget that.

The boy has sat down. Jimmy quietly breaks down.

JIMMY
I’m sorry.

SISTER JAMES
I’m sorry, Jimmy.

EXT. PARKCHESTER - A QUIET HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - DAY

Mrs. Miller and Sister Aloysius walk along. It’s a green and
quiet place. A somber day. They come down a flight of steps.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Have you met Father Flynn?

MRS. MILLER
Just seen him on the altar, haven’t
met him face to face. No. Just, you
know, heard from Donald.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
And what does he say?

MRS. MILLER
Oh, you know, “Father Flynn, Father
Flynn.” He looks up to him. The man
gives him his time, which is what
the boy needs. He needs that.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem.

(CONTINUED)
71.

MRS. MILLER
Well, I thought there musta been a
reason you wanting to see me.
Principal’s a big job. I just want
to say though, it’s just till June.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Excuse me?

MRS. MILLER
Whatever the problem is, Donald
just has to make it till June. Then
he’s off into high school.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Right.

MRS. MILLER
If Donald can graduate from St.
Nicholas, he’s got a better chance
of getting into a good high school.
And that would mean an opportunity
at college.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Well, I don’t see anything at this
time standing in the way of his
graduating with his class.

MRS. MILLER
Well, that’s all I care about.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I doubt that.

MRS. MILLER
Try me.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BASKETBALL COURT IN THE BACKGROUND - DAY

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I am concerned about the
relationship between Father Flynn
and your son.

MRS. MILLER

You don’t say. Concerned. What do
you mean, concerned?

(CONTINUED)
72.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That it may not be right.

MRS. MILLER
Well, there’s something wrong with
everybody, isn’t that so? Got to be
forgiving.
(points)
I work right there.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’m concerned, to be frank, that
Father Flynn may have made advances
on your son.

MRS. MILLER
May have made.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I can’t be certain.

MRS. MILLER
No evidence?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No.

MRS. MILLER
Then maybe there’s nothing to it.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I think there is something to it.
I think Father Flynn gave Donald
that altar wine.

MRS. MILLER
Why would he do that?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Has Donald been acting strange

lately--?

MRS. MILLER
(overlaps)
No.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Nothing out of the ordinary?

(CONTINUED)
73.

MRS. MILLER
He’s been himself.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Alright.

MRS. MILLER
Look, Sister. I don’t want any
trouble.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I don’t uhh...I’m not sure you
completely understand.

MRS. MILLER
I think I understand the kind of
thing you’re talking about. But I
don’t want to get into it.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What’s that?

MRS. MILLER
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing, but if we’re
talking about something floating
around between this priest and my
son, it ain’t my son’s fault.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh, I’m not suggesting that--.

MRS. MILLER
(overlaps)
He’s just a boy.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I know.

MRS. MILLER
Twelve years old. If somebody
should be taking blame, it should
be the man, not the boy.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

I know. I agree with you
completely.

(CONTINUED)
74.

MRS. MILLER
You're agreeing with me, but I got
called to the principal if you know
what I’m saying.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I am concerned about Donald’s
welfare.

MRS. MILLER
You honestly think that priest gave
Donald that wine to drink?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes, I do.

MRS. MILLER
Then how come my son got kicked off
the altar boys if it was the man
that gave it to him?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I know. The boy got caught, the man
didn’t.

MRS. MILLER
So you're giving my son the blame.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No.

MRS. MILLER
No problem my son getting blamed.
And you know why that is?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Perhaps you should let me talk. I
think you’re getting upset now.

MRS. MILLER
Sister, you ain’t going against no
MAN in a ROBE and win. He’s got the
position.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
And he’s got your son.

MRS. MILLER
Let him have him then.

(CONTINUED)
75.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What?

MRS. MILLER
It’s just till June.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Do you know what you’re saying?

MRS. MILLER
Know more about it than you.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I believe this man is creating or
may have already brought about an
improper relationship with your
son.

MRS. MILLER
I don’t know.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I know I am right.

MRS. MILLER
Why you gotta know something like
that for sure when you don’t?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What kind of mother are you?

A wind comes up.

MRS. MILLER
Excuse me, but you don’t know
enough about life to say a thing
like that, Sister.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I know enough.

MRS. MILLER
You know the rules maybe, but that
don’t cover it.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I know what I won’t accept!

(CONTINUED)
76.

MRS. MILLER
You accept what you gotta accept
and you work with it.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
This man is in my school.

MRS. MILLER
Well, he’s gotta be somewhere and
maybe he’s doing some good, too.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
He is after the boys!

MRS. MILLER
Well, maybe some of them boys want
to get caught! That’s why his
father beat him. Not the wine.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What are you telling me?

MRS. MILLER
I’m talking about the boy’s nature
now, not anything he’s done. You
can’t hold a child responsible for
what God gave him to be.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’m only interested in actions,
Mrs. Miller.

MRS. MILLER
But then there’s the boy’s nature.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Leave that out of it.

MRS. MILLER
Forget it then. You’re the one
forcing people to say things. My
boy came to your school ‘cause they
were going to kill him in the
public school. His father don’t
like him. He come to your school,
kids don’t like him. One man is
good to him. This priest. Then does
the man have his reasons? Yes.
Everybody does. YOU have your
reasons.

(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
77.

But do I ask the man why he’s good
to my son? No. I don’t care why. My
son needs some man to care about
him and to see him through the way
he wants to go. I thank God, this
educated man with some kindness in
him wants to do just that.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
This will not do.

MRS. MILLER
It’s just till June.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I'll throw your son out of this
school.

MRS. MILLER
And why would you do that if it
didn’t start with him?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Because I will stop this.

MRS. MILLER
You'd hurt my son to get your way?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
It won’t end with your son.

MRS. MILLER
Throw the priest out then.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I am trying to do just that.

MRS. MILLER
Then what do you want from me?

Sister Aloysius struggles for a moment.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Nothing. As it turns out.

MRS. MILLER
Please leave my son out of this. My
husband will kill that child over a
thing like this.

(CONTINUED)
78.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I will try.
MRS. MILLER
I’m late. Sister, I don’t know if
you and me on the same side. I'1l
be standing with my son and those
who are good with my son. It'd be
nice to see you there. Good
morning.
She goes, leaving Sister Aloysius, who is shaken. She walks
away. A SUDDEN WIND ENGULFS HER. She struggles with the wind
and dead leaves.

EXT. ST. NICHOLAS SCHOOL - SISTER ALOYSIUS ENTERS - DAY

It’s raining heavily, and very windy.

INT. ST. NICHOLAS SCHOOL - STAIRWELL - DAY

Sister Aloysius hurries up the stairs.

INT. ST. NICHOLAS SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

LOW DUTCH ANGLE

Sister Aloysius walks down the hallway. She stops,
experiences a moment of nausea, and then makes for her
office.

INT. THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

There’s a window open. Flynn appears. He has been awaiting
her return.

FLYNN
May I come in?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
A third party would be required.

FLYNN

Yeah. What was Donald’s mother
doing here?

(CONTINUED)
79.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
We were having a chat.

FLYNN
About what?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
A third party would truly be
required, Father. Why - -

Flynn enters the office.

INT. THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY
Flynn is in. He shuts the door.

FLYNN
No, Sister. No third party. You and
me are due for a talk.

The storm picks up outside.

FLYNN
You have to stop this campaign
against me!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You can stop it at any time.

FLYNN
How?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Confess and resign.

FLYNN
You are attempting to destroy my
reputation!

A gust of wind comes in the window and blows some papers on
the floor. She goes to the window. She raises the blinds,
shuts the window, flips the blinds open.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Who keeps opening my window?! What
are you doing in this school?

FLYNN
I’m trying to do good!

(CONTINUED)
80.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
(on her knees, picking up the
fallen papers)
Even more to the point, what are
you doing in the priesthood?

FLYNN
You are single-handedly holding
this school and this parish back!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
From what?

FLYNN
Progressive education and a
welcoming Church.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You can’t distract me, Father. This
is not about my behavior, it’s
about yours.
(She stands upright)

FLYNN
No, this is about your unfounded
suspicions.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That’s right.

She starts arranging the papers.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I have suspicions.

FLYNN
Just leave that. It’s not
important.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I will decide what’s important.

FLYNN
WHY do you suspect me? What have I
done?

SISTER ALOYSIUS

You gave that boy wine, and you let
him take the blame.

(CONTINUED)
81.

FLYNN
That’s completely untrue! Did you
talk to Mr. McGuinn?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
All McGuinn knows is that the boy
drank wine. He doesn’t know how he
came to drink it.

FLYNN
Did his mother have something to
add to that?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No.

FLYNN
So that’s it.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I am not satisfied.

FLYNN
Ask the boy then!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh, he’d protect you.

FLYNN
Why would he do that?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Because you have seduced him.

FLYNN
You're insane! You’ve got it in
your head that I’ve corrupted this
child after giving him wine, and
nothing I say will change that.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That’s right.

FLYNN
But this has nothing to do with the
wine. Not really. You had a
fundamental mistrust of me before
this incident! It was you that
warned Sister James to be on the
lookout, wasn’t it?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That’s true.

FLYNN
So you admit it!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Certainly.

FLYNN
Why?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I know people.

FLYNN
That’s not good enough!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
It won't have to be.

FLYNN
How’s that?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You will tell me what you have
done!

FLYNN
Oh I will?

The light bulb overhead blows out again.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Out again!

FLYNN
Sister James is convinced I’m
innocent.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh, so you talked to Sister James?
Well, of course you talked to
Sister James.

FLYNN

Did you know that Donald’s father
beats him?

(CONTINUED)
SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

FLYNN
And might that not account for the
odd behavior Sister James noticed
in the boy?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
It might.

FLYNN

Then what is it? What? What did you

hear, what did you see that
convinced you so thoroughly?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What does it matter?

FLYNN
It matters! What does it matter? I
want to know.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Out this window I saw you grab
William London’s wrist...and I saw
him pull away.

FLYNN
Are you serious?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I am.

FLYNN
That’s all?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yeah. That was all.

FLYNN
That’s nothing!

He sits at her desk and writes in his book. Rain drums down

outside.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
What are you doing now?

(CONTINUED)
84.

FLYNN
I'm writing down what you say. It
might be important when I have to
explain why you have to be removed.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
This morning, before I spoke with
Mrs. Miller, I took the precaution
of calling your last parish.

FLYNN
What'd he say?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Who?

FLYNN
The Pastor.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I did not speak to the Pastor. I
spoke to a nun.

FLYNN
You should have spoken to the
Pastor.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I spoke to a nun.

FLYNN
You know that’s not the proper
route for you to have taken,
Sister! The Church is very clear.
You’re supposed to go through the
Pastor.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Why? You have an understanding, you
and he?

FLYNN
No, you have no right to go
rummaging through my past!

SISTER ALOYSIUS

You have a history. This is your
third parish in five years. Why?

(CONTINUED)
85.

FLYNN
Call the Pastor. Ask him why I
left! It’s perfectly innocent.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I’m not calling the Pastor.

FLYNN
I’m a good priest!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You will go after another child and
another child, until you are
stopped.

FLYNN
What nun did you speak to?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I won't say.

FLYNN
I’ve not touched a child.

SISTER ALOYSIUS

You have.

FLYNN
You haven’t the slightest proof of
anything.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
But I have my certainty, and armed
with that, I will go to your last
parish, and the one before that if
necessary. I’1l find a parent.
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.

FLYNN
You have no right to act on your
own! You have taken vows, obedience
being one! You answer to us! You
have no right to step outside the
church!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I will step outside the church if
that’s what needs to be done, till
the door should shut behind me!
(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
86.

I will do what needs to be done,
though I’m damned to Hell!

During last, she brandished rosary and then slammed it down.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You should understand that, or you
will mistake me. Now, did you give
Donald Miller wine to drink?

FLYNN
Have you never done anything wrong?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I have.

FLYNN
A mortal sin?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

FLYNN
And?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I confessed it, Father!

FLYNN
Then whatever I have done, I have
left in the healing hands of my
confessor. As have you! We are the
same!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No, we are not, we are not the
same! A dog that bites is a dog
that bites!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Did you give Donald Miller wine to

FLYNN
No.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Mental reservation?

(CONTINUED)
87.

FLYNN
No.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You lie. Very well then. If you
will not leave my office, I will.
And once I go, I will not stop.

She goes to the door. Suddenly, a new tone comes into his
voice.

FLYNN
Wait!

The RAIN STOPS. A silence falls.

FLYNN
I can’t say everything, you
understand? There’s things I can’t
say. Even if you can’t imagine the
explanation, Sister, remember there
are things beyond your knowledge.
Even if you feel certainty, it is
an emotion, not a fact.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You will request a transfer, and
take a leave of absence until it’s
granted.

FLYNN
You'd leave me nothing.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
It’s Donald Miller who has nothing,
and you took full advantage of
that.

FLYNN
I’ve done nothing wrong. I care
about that boy.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Why? ‘Cause you smile at him and
you sympathize with him, and you
talk to him as if you were the
same? You are a cheat. And that
warm feeling you experienced, when
that boy looked at you with trust,
was not the sensation of virtue.

(CONTINUED)
88.

That could be got by any drunkard
with his tot of rum.

FLYNN
I can fight you.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
You will lose.

FLYNN
Where’s your compassion?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Nowhere you can get at it.

Sunlight starts to illuminate the office.
SISTER ALOYSIUS
Stay here. Compose yourself. You
can use the phone if you like. Good
day, Father.
She starts to go, has one more thought.
SISTER ALOYSIUS
I have no sympathy for you. I know
you are invulnerable to true
regret.
She heads to the door.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
And cut your nails.

She goes, closing the door behind her. After a moment, he
goes to the desk. He sits there a moment. He opens his
Bible, and removes the pressed flowers.

I never like to say goodbye. But
there is a wind behind every one of

We never see it, we can’t command

I would have stayed among you
longer, but that wind is taking me
away.

But I’m content that the power that

knowledge as to what is for the
best, and that is my faith. I
would like to come down now among
you and say goodbye, and wish you
peaceful hearts and loving hearts.

Goodbye. I'll stop by. God bless

approaches her.

Sister James, welcome back.

SISTER JAMES
Thank you, Sister.

You were missed. How is your
brother?

SISTER JAMES
Better. Much better.

I’m very glad. I prayed for him.

Then I’m glad you did it.

SISTER JAMES
And Father Flynn is gone.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

SISTER JAMES
So you did it. You got him out.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

SISTER JAMES
Donald Miller is heartbroken.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Can't be helped. It’s just till
June.

SISTER JAMES
I don’t think Father Flynn did
anything wrong.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
No? He convinced you?

SISTER JAMES
Yes, he did.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Hmmm.

SISTER JAMES
Did you ever prove it?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
To whom?

SISTER JAMES
Anyone but yourself?

(CONTINUED)

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Nope.

SISTER JAMES
But you were sure.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes.

SISTER JAMES
I wish I could be like you.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Why?

SISTER JAMES
Because I can’t sleep anymore.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Maybe we’re not supposed to sleep
so well. They made Father Flynn
Pastor of Saint Jerome.

SISTER JAMES
Who?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
The Bishop appointed Father Flynn
Pastor of Saint Jerome Church and
School. It’s a promotion.

SISTER JAMES
You didn’t tell them?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Oh, I told our good Monsignor. I
crossed the garden and I told him.
He did not believe it to be true.

SISTER JAMES
Then why did Father Flynn go? What
did you say to make him leave?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
That I had called a nun in his
previous parish. That I had found
out his prior history of
infringements.

(CONTINUED)
93.

SISTER JAMES
So you did prove it!

SISTER ALOYSIUS
I made no such call.

SISTER JAMES
You lied?

SISTER ALOYSIUS
Yes. But if he’d had no such
history, the lie wouldn’t have
worked. His resignation was his
confession. He was what I thought
he was. And he’s gone.

SISTER JAMES
I can’t believe you lied.

SISTER ALOYSIUS
In the pursuit of wrongdoing, one
steps away from God. Of course
there is a price.
