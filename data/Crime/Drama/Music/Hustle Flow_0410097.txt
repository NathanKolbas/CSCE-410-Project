INT. D.JAY’S CHEVY - DAY

IN DARKNESS, we hear the sound of a struggling air
conditioner. Three circles glow red - the reverse side of an
old Chevy Capri cigarette lighter as it burns to life.

A subtle 808 pounding is heard: BOOM... BOOM... BOOM...

D.JAY
See, man ain’t like a dog.

Pop! The pounding stops.

The lighter ejects. D.Jay lights a cigarette and speaks to
someone sitting shotgun in his parked car. D.Jay is an
intense looking, black man in his thirties.

D.JAY (CONT'D)

I’m talkin’ about mankind, not man like
men, cuz men... well, we a lot like a
dog. You know we... piss on things. Sniff
a bitch when we can, get a pink hard-on
like they do. And we territorial. You
know, we protect our own.

{a quick drag)
But, man... he know about death. He got
religion. Got a sense of history. Dogs
don’t know shit about birthdays or
Christmas or that one day God gonna come
callin’. So they walkin’ through life,
you know, carefree. But people like you
and me, we always guessin’. Always
wantin’ to know “what if”, naw what I
mean?

D.Jay scans the street quickly and turns back.

D.JAY (CONT'D)

So when you say to me, hey, I don’t think
we should be doin’ this. I gotta say, uh-
huh. I don’t think we should be doin’
this neither. But we ain’t gonna get a
move on in this world layin’ in the sun,
lickin’ our ass all day. We men. I mean,
you a woman, but we man.

(D.Jay leans back,

confident}
That said... you tell me. What’chu wanna
do with your life?

Although she is white, NOLA opts to wear long blond mini-

braids like most of the black topless dancers at the local
clubs. She is, to her best recollection, 20 years old.

Nola thinks. Struggles. Shrugs. Thinks some more. An idea.

NOLA
I don’t know. I guess I could...

D.JAY
Hold up.

A car pulls alongside of D.Jay’s Chevy. A beady-eyed, bearded
Man with pasty white skin examines Nola.

D.JAY (CONT'D)

How it go, Cuz? Like what ya see?

(He continues to stare)
It break down to 20 in the front. 40 in
the back.

(no answer)
Hello?

(D.Jay turns to Nola)
Hey. Go’on over and explain it to this
mother-fucker.

Nola steps out of the Chevy wearing yellow hot pants and
platform high heels. She marches towards the trick’s car and

climbs in. D.Jay watches the car drive off as he takes
another drag.

It’s a slow, hot day in Memphis.

CUT TO:
OPENING CREDITS

curt TO:
INT. D.JAY’S CHEVY - DAY
D.Jay and Nola are driving downtown in the Chevy. Nola is
daydreaming while D.Jay tries to find a good tune on the old,

push button, radio. Nothing sounds good - commercials.

D.JAY
Nothin’ but jive and junk.

EXT. ARNEL’S CLUB - DAY

D.Jay’s beat-up Chevy rolls on shiny rims as it turns into
the parking lot of ARNEL’S CLUB - an urban Juke joint.
Rev. 6/24/04 (Original White) 3.

INT. ARNEL’S CLUB - DAY

Nola and D.Jay enter through the front door just as ARNEL
tosses a babbiing DRUNK at them.

D.JAY
Goddamn !

Arnel is short and small like a black bulldog, but he’s full
of spit for a man in his fifties. He shouts at the drunk.

ARNEL
Pull that shit again, nigga, and I'll
black boot ya to hell. You heard me!

The drunk tries to shout back, but D.Jay grabs him by the
hair and tosses his ass out.

D.JAY
Get on, now!

ARNEL
Thanks, D.

Nola watches with wide eyes as Arnel examines the blood
soaked face of the assaulted patron.

ARNEL (CONT'D)
Take an angry drunk over a crazy one.
Angry drunk, you see somethin’ like this
comin’. But them crazies...
(puts bar towel on the

man’s nose)
Just hold that towel on it. We’1l get’cha
stitched.

{crosses to D.Jay)
I think that sun out there is bakin’
peoples brains.

D.Jay leans on the bar. Nola climbs onto the stool and spins
around like she is a five year old.

NOLA
D.Jay, he keep the air on, and all, but
it don’t do nothin’ but blow more hot air
in my face. So I just stay sticky all day
long...

D.JAY

(frustrated)
Just say it’s hot.

Wanna see my kitchen?
D.JAY
I’1l take a peek.
CUT TO:
6 INT. ARNEL’S KITCHEN - LATER - DAY

Arnel and D.Jay huddle in the back storage room of the
kitchen - Arnel already has his wallet out.

D.JAY

You lookin’ for a half or a full “oO?”
ARNEL

Ounce’1l be good. Fourth comin’ up and

all.

D.Jay reaches into his back pocket and removes an ounce of
pot in a clear sandwich bag.

ARNEL (CONT’D)
Hey. You remember that sticky herb you
brung up to my brother’s house for Play-
offs?

D.JAY
(holds up the bag)
That ain’t this, now. That’s a whole
‘nother zip-lock bag. Fuckin’ prime
product you talkin’. I use them “yellow-
and-blue-make-green” bags on that shit.

ARNEL
How much notice you need?

D.JAY
Little Italian dude from Nawlin’s bring
me up an elbow every couple a weeks.
What? You need a bag?

ARNEL
We got some big company come up in here
for the fourth. Thought you may wanna get
you some money.

D.JAY
Big company?

ARNEL
You remember Skinny? Skinny Black.

D.JAY
Shit. I know who Skinny is. We go back in
the day. Boy was hustlin’ his underground
tapes down at the drive-in out the back
of his Cutlass.

ARNEL
Not no more, he ain’t. You know that last
one he put out went platinum.

D.JAY
(thinks on that)
Eh, now Platinum, that’s more special
than gold, huh?

Arnel shoves the bag into his pocket and then pulls out a
modest roll of cash.

ARNEL
He big time now... but he still Memphis,
you know. He and his brother Tigga hook
up with they friends every July. I shut
the place down, make it all private for
them and they buy up my stock. No shit.
They clean me out.

D.Jay is suddenly preoccupied. His expression turns serious,
sullen.

D.JAY
Yeah. I know Skinny. He may not... I
mean, you know we went to different
schools and all... but... yeah, I know
Skinny.

ARNEL
You wanna make a dollar, best get up here
with that good shit. Those boys ain’t
gonna want none a’this dirt weed.

D.JAY
You tryin’ to hurt my feelings?

ARNEL
Just helpin’ out a friend.

A clap of thunder as the bottom falls out of the sky. The

KING OF CLUBS sign glows bright red through the rain. Rap
pounds the walis from the inside.

INT. KING OF CLUBS - NIGHT

D.Jay enters, holding his over-shirt above his head to stay
dry.

MICKEY is barely audible as he chatters into the microphone
from his DJ booth.

MICKEY

(into the mic)
We gotta two for one goin’ on through the
next two songs, folks. Any of these
lovely ladies will be giving two dances,
two dances, fellas, for the price of one.
We got Luscious. We got Phoebe. We got
Lexus comin’ up on satellite one.

(notices D.Jay)
‘Sup, D. Comin’ down, huh?

D.Jay nods and crosses to the main stage. Dancers are
writhing around the various buckets and pans on the stage
collecting rain dripping through the roof.

D. JAY
(to a dancer)
Where Lexus at?

The Dancer points. D.Jay turns and finally locates LEXUS. She
is straddling a trucker in a chair. Her bikini top glows
bright orange across her ebony skin, her hair is braided,
stretching down her arching back.

D.Jay motions her over. Lexus keeps hustling with a smile,
surreptitiously flipping off D.Jay. He then grabs Lexus by
the arm and pulls her off the customer.

LEXUS
Excuse me! You see me workin’?
D.JAY
Where you at?
LEXUS
I ain’t at nothin’. Done three dances all

day.

MICKEY
(over the mic)
Alright, guys, let’s put your hands
together for the lovely Lexus.

Lexus starts walking toward the stage.

LEXUS
Every bitch in here got some
playa, tellin’ ‘em how they
can hustle they tricks better
than we hustlin’. Bunch’a
side-seat drivin’, mother-
fuckers. I’11 make my dollar
just let me do my thang.
Shit, I’m old school!

D. JAY
It's like I say, you can’t be
picky on a Wednesday. You
gotta take what they
Slangin’.

D.Jay waves her off and walks away. Lexus pulls herself up on
the pole and hangs upsidedown.

cur To:
INT. KING OF CLUBS - DRESSING ROOM ~ NIGHT 9

The conversations are loud and full of laughter as D.Jay
sells a quarter ounce bag to a dancer in the dressing room.

Lexus is getting dressed at a leisurely pace. D.Jay grabs her
head as she sits to put on her shoes and puts it up to his
stomach.
D.JAY
You hear that? That’s my empty gut sayin’
hurry the fuck up.

CUT TO:
EXT. KING OF CLUBS ~- D.JAY’S CAR - NIGHT 10

Nola awakes from the back seat, sitting up slowly as Lexus
and D.Jay hop in the front seat.

She ain’t made five hundred dollars. Who?
Trudy? Bitch gotta birth mark on her face
look like a map a Texas. She trickin’.

LEXUS
She ain't trickin’.... all she did was
dance for him.

Suddenly there is a loud pound on the window. Lexus screams.
D.Jay looks out to see HAROLD - a skinny, pale-skinned,
junkie, wearing a few layers of thrift store wind-breakers.

LEXUS (CONT'D)
What the hell-fuck?!

HAROLD
(from outside the window)
Hey, D.Jay. It’s Harold, man. It’s me.

D.Jay jumps out of the car slamming the door behind him. He
pushes Harold back away from the car.

HAROLD (CONT'D)
Whoa, man... it’s me... it’s me, D.day...
It’s Harold!

D.dJAY

D.JAY

HAROLD
Yeah? Well... what could I get for this?

Harold removes a small electronic KEYBOARD from a sack.

D.JAY
Do I look like a pawn shop?

HAROLD
Like an ounce? What?

D.JAY
Shit. I wouldn’t give you a toke. Where
you get this at?

HAROLD

D.JAY :
Why don’t you give ‘em your thumb print.
See how much you get.

HAROLD
(relents)
Okay.

D.Jay reaches into his coat pocket and slaps a bag into
Harold’s hand.

HAROLD (CONT'D)
(handing over the
keyboard)
I don’t think that’s really a fair trade
but I... I understand you’ve got to keep
an eye on your interests and all.

D.JAY
You pushin’ me. Do you know you pushin’?

And Harold is off into the night. D.Jay regards the keyboard.
His fingers touch the keys as a subtle 808 beat pounds in his
ears: BOOM... BOOM... BOOM.

D.day and his girls live in one of many shotgun houses along
a crowded street. Kids run past them as they step out of the
car. D.Jay calls out to an old woman on her porch.

D.JAY
Miss Cole! That runt bitch of yours got
in my trash again. I know it won’t your
fault but get one yo kids to clean it up.

SHUG

Y’all got tacos?

D.JAY

Naw, we got cheeseburgers.

CUT TO:

INT. D.JAY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 12

SHUG (short for SUGAR} is a pretty, twenty year old, black
girl who is about four weeks short of giving birth - swollen
beyond belief for her tiny frame. She is soft spoken, sweet.

Shug bites into a burger as they all watch the TV - a local
rap video program.

SHUG

I called the power comp’ny ‘bout gettin’
an extension on the light bill. They say
I gotta come down and stand in line to
get an application.

(takes a bite)
But I can’t be standin’ all day how they
do down there. Not if I got Roger with
me. You know, D.? You know?

A video concludes - another begins. It is a SKINNY BLACK CD.

Ain’t that some shit?

LEXUS
Who? You?

The video is standard in aesthetics, gleaming BMWs, booty
girls shaking into the lens. Skinny Black is wearing a

pristine black and white camouflage suit.

D.JAY
Me and Skinny... do some catch up. You
know, he used to live up on Looney and
Third. Where they spray down the trolleys
at.

LEXUS
Am I supposed to piss myself?
D.JAY

walks away)

Yeah, okay... okay... you tell me. Who is

LEXUS
Nobody in this crib.
{speaking in a whiny baby
voice)
Where’s my baby? Roger?

SHUG
Lex. Don’t. I just got him to sleep.

Lexus goes into the back room to retrieve her baby. D.Jay
continues to watch the video as Shug complains to the back of
his head.

SHUG (CONT'D)
D, I know it’s my part in it all to baby-
sit while she at work. But she always
gotta wake him up just when I get him
down. I gotta have some chill time too.

D.JAY

D.Jay is still holding the small keyboard as he bites into
his burger. He opens the door to his private workroom. He
turns on a single bulb from above by yanking on a chain.
There is a simple scale on the table, a few boxes of sandwich

bags.
D.JAY

better than gold. In the day, I’s like...

Lexus enters holding her baby boy, ROGER, in her arms.

With Roger tucked under one arm, D.Jay begins pressing the
different keys, listening to the various sounds, changing
between the different menus.

Roger is drooling, mesmerized with sounds just like D.Jay -
two little boys with a new toy.

D.JAY
{laughing)
Yeah, that buck ain’t it.

We CUT IN AND OUT of moments as D.Jay acclimates himself with
his new keyboard.

He takes Roger’s hands and taps them on the keys - each key
makes a different beat. They actually manage to peck out a
Simple beat. D.Jay laughs.

The beat is interrupted by Lexus storming into the room
wearing a towel around her hips and head.

LEXUS
The fuck are you doin’ wit my son?

D.JAY
Just playin’.

LEXUS
(pulls Roger away)
Give me my baby.

D.JAY
Every time he get settled you gotta come
and fuck with him. Gonna give that boy a
twitch.

The door slams. D.Jay lights a blunt and closes his eyes.

The 808 beat can be heard softly - the pounding in his head.

He opens his eyes and pulls the keyboard closer. Pressing the
loop button, he matches the keyboard beat to the beat in his

head. It fits perfectly: Pip. Tack, tack, pip, tack.

D.Jay looks on the back of the keyboard. A single headphone
jack is on the back.

An idea hits as the loop continues.
JUMP CUTS as he opens a drawer next to his massive stereo and

removes a long cable. He pushes it into the inputs behind his
huge stereo.

D.Jay takes the other end of the cable and plugs it into the
headphone jack on the keyboard.

BOOM! TACK, TACK, BOOM, TACK! BOOM! TACK, TACK, BOOM, TACK!

D.Jay’s work room. The TV distorts with the beat.

INT. D.JAY’S WORK ROOM ~- NIGHT 20
D.Jay circles his table, punching at the air with each beat.

The pot scales vibrate. D.Jay bounces his upper body up and
down furiously - a man alone with his own invention.

He turns off the keyboard with the push of a button. He is
panting - suddenly aware of his own heart pounding.

Silence.

CUT TO:
INT. D.JAY'S CAR - PARKED ON THE STREET - DAY 21
Nola snorts up some crank off a small swatch of shiny paper.

D.Jay and Nola are parked by an old auto shop - hisses and
pops sound from inside as D.Jay eyes a car driving up slowly.

D.JAY
Go easy, gal. Can’t be no open candy
store. We tight this whole week.
(D.Jay nudges Nola)
Put yo shine on. Here this one come.

Nola wipes away sweat as the driver approaches, she attempts
to put on a sexy scowl for the passing trick.

D.JAY (CONT'D)
Come on, Cuz. We ain’t gonna bite.

The driver tries to get a good look at Nola but then speeds
past. D.Jay shakes his head in frustration.

D.JAY (CONT’D)

What the fuck it is you do.

The car stops. D.Jay has turned his cold attention to Nola.

Knowing she has wounded D.Jay, Nola gains a modicum of
confidence. She leans across D.Jay as if he was not even
there.

NOLA (CONT'D)
(to the trick)
Hey, Honey. You wanna see me walk in
these heels all the way over to your lap?

The trick nods nervously. Nola smiles and crawls back inside.

NOLA (CONT’D)
(bitter) :
Look like he got air in his car. Must
work as hard as you.

Nola slams the door behind her.

She parades her high-heeled saunter in front of D.Jay, and
hops in the trick’s car. D.Jay fumes as the car drives off.

CUT TO:

INT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - DAY 22

D.Jay’s shirt is wet from sweat as he enters the CORNER
GROCERY STORE - a small, unassuming establishment. Nola
trails behind and immediately goes for the ice cream
freezers.

ELROY, mid thirties, sits behind the counter. D.Jay reaches
past Elroy to a pack of cigarettes in a display. Elroy glares
as D.Jay cracks open the pack and lights up.

ELROY
You wanna do my job? I got a mop for ya.

D.JAY
Elroy. I’m havin’ a day that just won’t
quit. So... shine a little light on me,
huh?

ELROY
You got something for me?

D.Jay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a leather tobacco
bag and a small NOTEPAD. D.Jay wipes a handful of sweat away
from his brow and places the bag before Elroy.

ELROY
(showing D.Jay his hand)
Shit, D. I don’t want yer stank on me.
Look at this shit. I don’t even like my
own sweat on me. Sure as hell don’t want

A surge of anger hits D.Jay. He snatches the wad of cash from
Elroy’s hand and shoves it deep down the.front of his pants
into his crotch. .

D.JAY
Tell you what. Let’s get some of my sweet
juice on it. See how you like that.
(pulls out the cash and
slams it on the counter)
Go on. Tell me you ain’t gonna pick that

up.

Elroy glares at D.Jay but chooses not to antagonize him
today. He picks up the wad of cash.

ELROY
Let's get you on your way, D.

Elroy disappears into the back of the store. D.Jay looks over
at Nola, eating an ice cream sandwich.

D.JAY

D.day turns to see KEY. Key is a simple looking, chubby black
male in his mid-thirties. He is wearing glasses and a blue

INT. BELLEVUE BAPTIST CHURCH ~ DAY 24

A modest-sized gospel choir takes a deep breath and breaks
into the Spiritual “Keep Your Lamps Trimmed and Burning.”

We follow a gray cord from a hanging microphone to a
collection of cables. Key is recording the choir from the
pews of the church.

D.Jay is seated in the center of the church - Nola sits in
the back eating an ice cream sandwich.

The choir crescendos with chilling intensity. D.Jay is unable
to move as the song continues. He slowly grips the pew in
front of him, his chest rising with deep breaths through his
flaring nostrils.

The music is working on him.
The choir concludes abruptly, building into an accented

climax. Key holds one hand up in the air, indicating for
everyone to remain silent.

D.Jay is smoking a blunt, holding in the smoke and gently
blowing it back out. His keyboard holds a steady beat.

D.Jay sighs and closes his eyes.

Suddenly a wave of fear and paranoia hits. Something or
someone just charged at him. He scrambles to his feet,
looking around the room. What was that?

He holds his chest and tries to control his rapid panting.

He is alone in the room. He looks at the blunt and then
guickly taps it out into the bowl.

He turns the keyboard OFF.

Shug opens her eyes and sits up, cradling her stomach with

unable to protest. He looks at Shug. She shrugs.

D.Jay creeps through his own livingroom listening to Shelby

Shelby lays down a wicked melody as the keyboard pounds out

Rap music, fuzzy and heavy on bass through Arnel’s twenty
year old amplifiers.

D.Jay’s fingers break open a cigar, gutting the tobacco and
replacing it with his New Orleans herb.

With a roll and a lick, the two are ready to share a smoke -
the blunt is passed back and forth between D.Jay’s lips and
Skinny Black’s platinum grin.

They laugh together from a separate room of the club.
Skinny’s friends continue their party from a distant table.

Skinny is now half way through a story that he can barely get
out - a mild case of the giggles.

SKINNY BLACK
Had me this Mustang. Fuckin’ tight ride.
hood snout, maple dash... two-toned
metallic monster motherfucker. I go to
m’ lady's crib over in the Courts.

D.JAY
(laughing)
I had a lady in the Courts, too. Had a
few.

SKINNY BLACK
I go inside. Get my ugly on. Come out and
my ride is gone. And I nut pretty damn
fast... these fools must’a snagged my

D.JAY
Nobody cruise Millbranch no more. It all

SKINNY BLACK

We roll up in front. Box them mother-

‘em. Pullin’ these fools out my ride. And
I'm screamin’ like a woman, “Don’t touch
my car! Don’t touch my car! Ain’t you
seen my two-tone metallic?”

Their laughter dies down. They both take another hit off the
blunt. D.Jay eases in for the kill.

D.JAY
Skinny. I ain’t a scrap of cheese off yo’
table... but...
(holds up the demo tape)
My heart beats in this motherfucker. I
put my blood in it. .

SKINNY BLACK
Is that for me? Can I take that?

D.JAY
I ain’t tryin’ to play you. You the only
one I want to give this to. Cuz I respect
you. Cuz we old friends.

D.Jay Nods. Skinny Black is having a hard time focusing. He
wobbles on his feet and grabs on to D.Jay.

SKINNY BLACK (CONT'D)
Everybody gotta have a dream.
(again)
Everybody... gotta have a dream.

D.Jay nods, not knowing what to make of this statement. But
he rolls with it.

D.JAY

Skinny blinks, steadies himself.

D.Jay takes one last swig of beer and slaps a twenty on the

D.JAY
That’s for you, Arnel. Gonna take a piss
and roll.
ARNEL
See you, D.
cur TO:
INT. ARNEL’S CLUB - BATHROOM ~ NIGHT 96

D.Jay bursts into the bathroom, catching his reflection in
the mirror over the two sinks. He focuses his eyes, chasing
his buzz away.

And then an echoed mumble from somewhere in the bathroom. It
sounded like an attempt at language but came out as a garble
of slurs and vowels.

D.Jay is cautious more than curious as he opens the only
stall in the bathroom. He slowly pushes it open.

Skinny Black is passed out on the floor in front of the
toilet with his pants around his knees. He is mumbling
incoherently, occasionally flinching like a dog having a
nightmare.

D.Jay kneels down next to him, almost at eye level with
Skinny Black.

D.JAY (CONT’D)
Hey? Skinny? You need to piss, let's try
it standing up.

SKINNY BLACK
(barely audible)
Talk to me... about... shit...

D.JAY
That’s right. I’m talkin’ to you. You
need some help, dog?

No clear answer comes from Skinny Black. D.Jay stands Skinny
Black up, holding him in place with one hand.

D.JAY (CONT’D)
Tell you what? Ain’t many in this world
put a man’s dick away for a brother who
can't. Best show me some love for this.

D.Jay pulls Skinny Black’s pants up and buckles his belt.
Skinny Black is still mumbling.

D.JAY (CONT’D)
You know... we go on the road one day, I
ain’t gonna do this. A man could do all
kinds of trouble to you right now, you
wouldn’t even...

Something catches D.Jay’s eye. He lets go of Skinny Black,
letting him fall to the floor - smack.

D.Jay is stunned. He cannot swallow, he cannot blink, he
cannot look away.

He kneels before the toilet looking inside. He slowly reaches
into the toilet to retrieve his demo tape.

Dripping with piss and God knows what else, D.Jay lifts the
tape out of the toilet. The tape from inside the cassette has
been pulled out, hanging like a long tangled braid.

A rage builds in D.Jay as he lifts Skinny Black up against
the wall. The rage turns to unbearable hurt.

Skinny wakes up briefly, slurring, trying to talk.

SKINNY BLACK
Hey...

D.JAY
Hey, what... go on, Skinny, speak up.

SKINNY BLACK
You... you could...

D.JAY
What? What can I do?

SKINNY BLACK
You can suck my dick, bitch.

D.Jay nods. His rage is oddly calm.

D.JAY
You suck on this.

D.Jay crams the demo from the toilet into Skinny Black’s
mouth. He pushes it in hard.

D.JAY (CONT'D)
SUCK ON THIS!

D.Jay’s fury overtakes him. He throws Skinny Black to the
floor and pounds his face repeatedly.

After five hits to his face, Skinny reaches into his coat and
removes a silver .45 pistol. With another punch from D.Jay,
he drops the gun to the floor.

D.Jay grabs it and pushes the muzzle up against Skinny
Black’s face.

D.JAY (CONT’D)
Oh, you want this? YOU WANT THIS! Look at
me, Skinny. LOOK AT ME MOTHERFUCKER!

There is sudden silence save the music pounding from the club

outside. D.Jay realizes where his anger has taken him. Reason
returns. Fear pervades.

D.Jay kneels down next to Skinny Black, lightly slapping his
bloody cheeks attempting to bring him back to consciousness.

D.JAY (CONT’D)
You need to wake up, now. Come on... wake
up, Skinny.

Skinny lets out a groan. D.Jay stands quickly, suddenly
spooked.

D.JAY (CONT’D)
Shit. Oh, shit. D. What did you do...

The noise from outside increases suddenly as the man in the
YELLOW JACKET enters the bathroom.

YELLOW JACKET
Yo, Skinny! Where...?

He sees Skinny on the floor and D.Jay standing above him
holding the gun.

YELLOW JACKET (CONT’D)
What the fuck!

It all happens at once. Yellow Jacket quickly reaches inside
his coat pocket. D.Jay simply lifts his hand and fires,
hitting Yellow Jacket in the shoulder.

Blood splatters against the back wall. Yellow Jacket screams
and slips falling to the dirty floor tiles ~- his fresh wound
hitting first. Another howl.

D.day steps back in fear. He points the gun at Skinny and
then back at Yellow Jacket struggling on the floor and then
to the door, open wide to the now silent club.

D.JAY
(te Yellow Jacket}
Don’t you move! You hear me!

D.Jay notices Yellow Jacket looking out the bathroom door to
his friends.

INT. ARNEL’S CLUB - NIGHT 97

D.Jay appears in the doorway of the bathroom before a silent
and captive audience. Yellow Jacket squirms on the floor,
clutching his shoulder. He clinches his teeth attempting to
contain his pain.

Tigga moves forward. D.Jay points the gun right at Tigga.

D.JAY
Not tonight, Tigga.
(Tigga stops)
You wanna test me? Back up!
{they aren’t fast enough)
NIGGA BACK UP!

D.Jay’s shout scares himself just as much as it scares the
crowd.

As he backs toward the door, D.Jay notices Arnel behind the
bar, looking at D.Jay with confusion and fear. D.Jay attempts

to apologize with his eyes but it is already taking too long
to get out of the club.

With a burst of speed, D.Jay takes off out the door.
EXT. ARNEL’S CLUB - NIGHT 98

D.Jay runs to his car, trying to keep Skinny’s gun pointed at
the front door just in case. He scrambles for his keys.

The Chevy roars as D.Jay cranks it to life.

Four members of Skinny Black’s crew leap out of the club. One
aims a pistol at D.Jay’s car as he flies out of the parking
lot. He fires twice. The back window of the Chevy shatters.

D.Jay throws the door to the club open gripping the side of
the building to steady himself.

He takes deep breaths to stave off nausea. Reaching under his
leather coat, D.Jay retrieves Skinny’s gun.

With his free hand, he grips the silver watch on his opposite
wrist - the hand holding the gun.

A decision has been made.

Shug is on her knees, sobbing into Nola’s stomach.

D.Jay turns to the front of the car slowly putting his palms

He is slammed from behind by three officers. Shug screams

tightly onto Shug, quivering in her arms.

now erupted between the members of Skinny’s crew and D.Jay’s

Shelby and Key are filled with rage, they race at Tigga.

from the streets and now, you know, being
officers of the law. Gonna be my tag.
Goin’ as 5-0. You know, like my stage
name. Big 5-0.

D.Jay can not believe what he is hearing. The Block Manager
secretly hands him a demo tape: BIG 5-0 and BLOCK C.

BLOCK MANAGER
When you get a chance, in the rec room.
Let us know what you think.
D.Jay takes the tape and smiles.

D.JAY
Well... you know what they say.

BLOCK MANAGER
What's that?

D.JAY
Everybody gotta have a dream,

D.Jay turns away and walks back to his cell with the guard
keeping a respectful distance.

The 808 pounding returns to his ears and swagger: BOOM...
BOOM... BOOM... BOOM.

D.Jay’s smile fades as his Mode returns. He looks right at us
- hungry, determined. The 808 can’t get any louder.

BOOM... BOOM... BOOM... BOOM... BOOM... BOOM... BOOM... BOOM!
CUT TO BLACK
THE END
