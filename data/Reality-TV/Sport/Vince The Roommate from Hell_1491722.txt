INT. - RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Medium close-up of a twenty-something woman excitedly
rambling. The woman is chatting and looks to be genuinely
enjoying herself and oblivious to the man’s discomfort.

WOMAN #1
Well that’s when I knew I had to
just leave. I mean Rick was such a
tool, you know, I mean he was hot,
Oh My Gawd was he hot. He had the
sexiest Ab’s, you could totally
wash clothes on them, and...oh my
Gawd, that’s where that expression
came from, wow I just got that,
washboard Ab’s, isn’t that funny, I
mean they were tight but that’s all
he ever did, he went to the gym, I
mean he never wanted to do anything
like cultural or fun, you know? I
mean once I totally tried to get
him to come with me to this Thai
restaurant and he wouldn’t, he said
he didn’t like it and I told him
that he should totally try it,
cause Japanese people totally make
fantastic food, but he didn’t

Screen pause on the woman in mid-sentence as MIKE’s voice
over begins.

MIKE(V.0O.)
I fucking hate blind dates. This
future baby factory is a prime
example of why these things are
never a good idea. She hasn’t said
a single fucking sentence without
bringing up her ex-boyfriend.

The movie begins again.

WOMAN #1
---and Rick always used to tell me
that I should---

Screen freezes again as voice over begins.

MIKE(V.0O.)
The best part is that this "Rick"
character is probably at home
bonging beers with his gym "buds"
while discussing the finer points

MIKE(V.O.) (cont’d)
of rape. Good God, I bet she
watches the E channel.

Screen unfreezes as she begins talking again.

WOMAN #1
So then I told Rick that he could
have all his cd’s back but OH MY
GAWD, he totally tried taking my
Jack Johnson anthology and I was
like no way buster brown that one’s
mine and your totally not taking
it. oh I got him back though, (she
takes a deep breath, looks around
as if checking to see if anyone is
looking and begins to speak ina
low whisper) i totally took all his
auto-trader and Men’s health
magazines and burned ‘em. (squeal
and return to normal volume) Oh my
Gawd, was he pissed!

Woman begins laughing and bouncing in her seat.

WOMAN #1 (CONT’D)
It was so awesome, jeez, [snort]
well so what about you?

MIKE
What?, Oh, um,um I don’t. Really
uh, um have a story.

The screen freezes again and voice over adds.

MIKE(V.0O.)
Why in the nine hell’s would i tell
my story, if i had one, toa
fucking lunatic like you anyways.
Seriously, look at this---

Replay cut of woman laughing and bouncing up and down in her
chair in slow motion.

MIKE(V.0O.)
This lady is obviously legally
retarded. The fact that she isn’t
wearing any sort of cranial
protective gear is nothing short of
criminal. Fuck me man!

Screen unfreezes and it’s back to Woman #1 again.

WOMAN #1

(laughing)
Oh My GAWD, this one time Rick took
me to this comedy club to go see a
comic and he was so lame, we both
were just so bored that we started
doing these shots, I mean I’m not
even sure what was in ’em. So like,
I dunno, twenty minutes later or
something Rick was so drunk that he
jumped onstage and started telling
jokes about---

MIKE
You know, I’m starting to see why
Rick would rather be out tipping
cows with Deadlift Dan and Cardio
Chris than watching you pick out
shoes at the mall.

WOMAN #1
(looking around as if
confused)
What? I don’t...know what you---

MIKE lights a cigarette and inhales and exhales very slowly
while running his hand through his hair.

MIKE
Ok look, let’s just skip all the
pretense here and get down to the
facts. I can sit here all night and
shine you with some bullshit charm
and share some stupid stories so
that you think I’m willing to open
up to you and share. Then I could
pay for dinner and tell you how
amazing you are and agree with you
when you ask if I felt that
"something" between us. Then we’1l
go to your place where I will play
the perfect gentleman and keep my
hands to myself. Then you’1l try to
kiss me and I’11 pull away and say
that I don’t want to rush things
and that will make you want to fuck
me even more. So, we’1ll do the
deed, and afterward you’1l never
hear from me again and I’1l1 get to
tell my friends how you were OK in
bed but nothing special.

(CONTINUED) www.BarRoomHero.com

MIKE (CONT’D)
But that’s not gonna happen, what’s
going to happen is that I’m going
to find the fucking bar in this
place and to get so fucking drunk
that people are going to think my
last name’s Baldwin. At some point
you’re going gonna get pissed,
You’re gonna get so mad that when
you get home the first thing you’re
going to do is call Rick and demand
he comes over and fucks you like a
man. And after he gets tired of
you, again, you’re going to go on
many more dates that end just like
this, and believe me there will be
more. These dates are going to make
you realize how little you have to
offer and that Rick is the only one
shallow enough to listen to your
bullshit. So you’1l run back to
Rick and get hitched and pop out a
couple of pups, and deep down
you’re gonna know that this date
was in some sick, sad way,
responsible for your happiness. But
will I get a thank you? Fuck no I
won’t! I’1l still be here getting
belligerently drunk and at some
point, despite my lack of physical
prowess, I will find myself ina
brawl with a man that looks like
that.

 

MIKE points to a very large and rather mean looking guy
sitting at the bar, the guy looks at MIKE as he is pointing
and smiles devilishly.

WOMAN #1
(softly)
Wow, you, you [yelling] really need
help asshole, fuck you! You better
hope to God that Rick never see’s
you on the street!

The woman gets up in a huff and stops MIKE from replying by
grabbing a glass of water and throwing it’s contents into
his face. MIKE calmly spits out a stream of water and then
sticks a cigarette into his mouth and speaks.

MIKE
Call me.

The screen pauses again and the voice over kicks in.

MIKE
Now that’s some rad shit right
there. I wish to God I could tell
you that that’s how it went down
but alas, I suffer from a rare
disease that doctor’s refer to as
Osteospineusfemaleus, which is a
lack of spine in the face of the
fairer sex. So it actually went
something like this---

Scene changes to one of MIKE daydreaming as a voice off
camera is speaking to him.

WAITER
Sir, sir, excuse me? sir?

WAITER
Sir would you care for anything to
drink?

MIKE
Oh um sorry, yeah can I have a
Miller Lite (slight pause) and two
shots of Jameson.

WAITER
Very good sir.

WOMAN #1
I don’t drink whiskey, you know.

MIKE
Oh, OK, (sarcastically) wow great
because I didn’t order you
anything.

WOMAN #1
You are so funny [laughing] Sherry
never told me that, you should have
been at that comedy club, you would
of been funnier than that Jim, uh,
Jim Garafee, Grafagain, or whatever
it is. Speaking of, where was I, oh
so Rick started yelling stuff at
him, well one Rick was trashed but
he deserved it cause he sucked and
so---

MIKE exhales visibly and slumping in his chair. Screen
freezes again.

MIKE(V.0O.)
SHUT THE FUCK UP! SHUT UP! You
weasel faced CRONE! Who dropped a
steamer in your gene pool, FUCK! At
least it can’t get any worse.

WOMAN #1
And I think I totally have that
camera with those pictures in here
somewhere...

The waiter is walking back to the table and MIKE quickly
grabs the two shots off of his tray and downs them and then
grabs his beer and begins to chug it. Screen freezes on this
image.

MIKE(V.0.)
Fuck me.

Cue music and roll beginning credits.

PHOTO MONTAGE - DESKTOP OR DIGITAL (7?)

The movie opens with a series of photographs, Polaroids,
with MIKE doing a voice over introduction for each.

-Photo of Camelot bowling.

MIKE (V.0.)
This is where I grew up, a small
town about an hour outside of
Chicago, on the Indiana side of
course.

-Photo of MIKE and friends, drunk and hanging out.

MIKE (V.0.) (CONT’D)
There’s not really much to do here
minus drinking or various other
activities that some would consider
uncouth in the eyes of the lord.

-Photos of MIKE and STEVE in bed with a "few" women.
Switches to photo’s of paint huffing, smoking a bong and
them beating their chests with a mysterious white substance
on their nostril.

-Photo of MIKE smiling as he is surrounded by a group of
people.
Now, I used to love it here, I mean
seriously, life was one big party,
all my friends were here and I

MIKE (V.0.) (CONT’D) (cont’d)
really couldn’t imagine living
anywhere but here. That all changed
one day when I meet JULES.

-Photo of MIKE hugging some random woman.
Pretty soon though Jules decided
that I wasn’t stimulating enough
and stopped calling me.

-Photo of MIKE drinking two bottles of whiskey at the same
time.

-Photo of MIKE crying while holding a pair of woman’s
underwear.

-Photo through a partially cracked door of MIKE crying and
masturbating with a sock over his dick while smelling said
underwear.

Uh, ha ha, um yea, well things got

a little bad, to say the least, so

I decide to move.

-Photo of MIKE hanging out of a car window flicking off
randomly as he leaves.

-Photo of MIKE hugging another random girl.
So I moved and met someone else and
she turned out to be everything I
ever wanted.

-Photo’s of MIKE standing in random door ways while other
dudes are nailing said girl.

MIKE (V.0.) (CONT’D)
She also turned out to be
everything that a lot of guy’s
wanted. So I did what any immature
man-child would do, I packed up and
moved back home.

amused.[indistinct Country music plays on the radio] "

STEVE
So then she finished and she
fucking put it back in my pants and
zipped me up with just her mouth.
My GOD, she was like the David
Blaine of blow-jobs, that was top
five material, fo sure. Not exactly
number one or anything but
definitely top five.

, MIKE
That’s, um pretty, pretty, uh

STEVE
I mean number one still belongs to
Stacy, I mean she got a perfect ten
not just for technique but for
creativity as well, remember Fourth
of July four years ago?

MIKE
No.

STEVE
Oh bullshit! Yes you do, Remember
Stacy put my paste stick in that
hot dog bun and topped it with
ketchup and---

MIKE
Dammit dude, I totally forgot about
that, fuck man, that’s the summer
you ran around telling everyone you
got Kobayashi’d. Thanks for the
visual dude.

STEVE
Don’t act like you weren’t jealous,
she was a lady broseph, one of a
kind.

MIKE
(incredulous)

Dude, You caught the clap from her!
I don’t even know how that’s
possible, i mean, I don’t even now
what the fuck the clap is! And I’m
pretty sure no one but you guys
have had the clap since Vietnam.

STEVE
So what! Tons of people get the
clap, they get it everyday, one
shot and it’s gone.

MIKE
You got it four times that summer!

STEVE
What can I say, she was special.

MIKE
Stunning, simply stunning.

STEVE
Don’t make fun dick head. Besides,
we aren’t talking about me anymore,
what about you, I mean does it feel
weird being back in town?

MIKE
Um, not really um maybe a little
but I’m not really sure you know, I
haven’t really talked to anyone but
you and MARK since I’ve been...

STEVE
{excited} Dammit dude, there’s so
much ass down there, how the fuck
can you stand it here? Fuck man, my
dick would fall off if I lived down
there, seriously, it’d pop right
off.

MIKE
{uncomfortable laughter} I don’t
know man, I guess I’m just...

STEVE’s face, staring at MIKE dead seriously.
STEVE
My dick would fall off, I just
don’t think you get it.
STEVE slams on the car brakes and MIKE is thrown forward in
his seat. STEVE is staring at STEVE deadpan and is
illustrating his point with his hands.
MIKE (CONT’D)
Dude, [breathe] what the fuck!
[breathe]
STEVE is staring at MIKE again.

STEVE
My dick.

STEVE steers the car back onto the road while MIKE looks at
him wildly.

MIKE
Dude where are we going anyway?

STEVE
Well I was thinking we would head
over to O’Shea’s, maybe grab some
drinks.

MIKE
Oh no, no fucking way! Turn the car
around right now, I’m fucking going
home.

STEVE
Dude stop being a little bitch.
Come on, I don’t wanna drive all
the way out to Hillhurst to go toa
bar, why don’t you put on your big
girl panties and just go.

MIKE
[whining] dude I haven’t been there
for like three years, and I know
I’m going to see everyone I don’t
want to see. I’m going to have go
through the entire "hi guys, how’s
everything going, how’s life, oh
look at your baby, oh look at your
wife, that’s amazing, yea he’s big,
oh wow, nice car, nice house, what
me? Oh I’m living at home again,
what’s that, me, oh no not
graduated yet, nope I live in an 11
by 11 room, all of my worldly
possessions can fit in a van, crazy
right, Yea we should definitely do
this again, MAN this has been a
little slice."

STEVE is staring at MIKE with an incredulous look.

STEVE
What is wrong with you?

MIKE
[Mumbling] Nothing’s wrong with me
what’s wrong with you?... I’m

fucking, fan-Fucking-tastic.

STEVE
You do realize that there’s other
people in this car besides you,
don’t you? And the last time I

STEVE (cont’d)
checked I’m the one who is driving.
So why don’t you drop this whole
self-pitying, the world hates me
routine, and knock down a couple
beers with your best friend that
you haven’t seen in about six
months?

MIKE
Fine, fuck it! But you’re buying
the first two rounds, and you owe
me a shot for every time I have to
admit that I live at home.

STEVE looks extremely happy and victorious as he stomps down
on the gas pedal and the car accelerates.

STEVE
You’ve made a smart decision sir
considering we’re already almost
there. it’s like 2 o’clock in the
afternoon. Anyone in the bar this
early is bound to make you feel
better about yourself. Besides
living at home isn’t your biggest
problem, lot’s of people still live
at home. If I were you, I’d be
worried more about the fact that
your currently unemployed.

MIKE
Dude, I had my own business for
awhile man, don’t forget about
that.

STEVE
Oh yeah, how could I forget, the
lemonade stand.

MIKE
Beverage cart asshole.

STEVE
A, you never had a cart, B, all you
served was lemonade and C, your
stand was made of cardboard and had
no wheels so therefore it was a
non-mobile serving center for
lemonade---aka a lemonade stand.

MIKE
Thanks dick.

STEVE
Just saying man, Anyways, whatever
happened to that?

CUT TO:

EXT. - LAWN OUTSIDE A HOUSE - DAY

Flashback to a MIKE sitting behind a cheap cardboard
lemonade stand. Sign read’s MIKE’s Famous Lemonade, $1.00.
The camera flashes across the street to where a child of 8
is sitting behind another lemonade stand and is glaring at
MIKE. MIKE is sitting and looking bored when he reaches
underneath the stand and pulls out a vodka bottle. He pours
out a little lemonade from one of the cups and takes a
little sip. He shrugs his shoulders and pours out a larger
amount and pours in more vodka. He drinks it and nods his
head. He stares at the cup and then the bottle and shrugs
again and pours out all the contents of the cup and fills it
all with the vodka and begins to chug the contents. He
finishes it and replenishes the cup and repeats the chug.
Cut to the little kid from across the street staring at a
passed out MIKE on the lawn wearing nothing but a pair of
tightie whitey’s. The kid nudges MIKE with his foot a few
times and MIKE weakly pushes his foot away and rolls over
into a fetal position. The kid takes his pants off the
ground grabs his wallet and takes out the bills. He then
throws the wallet down and destroys MIKE’s Lemonade stand.

BACK TO:

INT. - STEVE’S CAR - DAY
MIKE
Business world politics. I got
strong armed outta the business.
Silence while MIKE seems to reflect on the memory.

MIKE
Maybe I could use a drink.
13.

EXT. - BAR - DAY

STEVE’s car pulls into a parking spot. MIKE and STEVE exit
car and walk towards bar.

STEVE
Dude don’t worry, everything’s
gonna be OK. It doesn’t even look
like anyone’s here.

MIKE
Whatever man, let’s just have a few
beers and go.

STEVE
[slyly] Oh shit, did I forget to
mention that there is this fucking
gorgeous bartender working here
now, she is fantastic. You have to
see her.

MIKE stops and eyes STEVE suspiciously. STEVE stops and
looks at MIKE with a sideways grin.

STEVE
What?

Camera looks at a grim faced MIKE.

Back to a

STEVE
Oh what? Come on now, you think, oh
Jesus come on man, I’m not that big
of a tool, you think I dragged you
here just so I can eye fuck a
measly bartender?

grim looking MIKE

STEVE
Ah dude, you are fucking
unbelievable, I can’t believe you
would assume something as heinous
as that, you know your lucky that
you have a friend like me who’s
looking out for you.

AS STEVE is talking MIKE is striding closer to where STEVE
is standing.
14.

INT. - BAR - DAY
STEVE walks in rubbing his arm and complaining...loudly.

STEVE
Really? 2 million years of human
evolution and your still resorting
to punching, That’s so fucked up
man, seriously, what the fuck?
Excuse me for giving a shit about
your dick, I just wanna see you use
it man, it’s hanging there, just
swaying from side to side [hand
motions] blowing whichever way the
wind does, hanging around like a
piece of dried jerky. Dick jerky!
That’s what it is!

STEVE stops and puts his hands on MIKE’s chest to stop him
in his tracks, STEVE’s face is pleading.

STEVE

Dude(x5) seriously. OK, look

you’ve been in sad bastard mode for
like the last three years, you even
moved away because of her, it’s
seriously about time to let go man,
let that shit go because if you
don’t it’s going to eat you up.

MIKE looks at STEVE with surprise and appreciation of his
honesty.

STEVE
Besides dude I’m going to tell you
something that no one else is going
to...{deep breath} a dick is a
terrible thing to waste.

Over the shoulder of MIKE looking mortified/incredulous.

STEVE
What?

MIKE
Don’t talk about my dick, he
doesn’t like you.

importance of proper dick

every a month or else that shit

backs up into your brain and you

quacking like a duck and...
MIKE has stopped walking and his jaw is hanging slightly
open and he is staring at the bartender. This is MAGGIE’s
introduction. Slow pan up of the bartender standing behind
the bar smoking a cigarette, she is attractive and graceful.
Cut back to MIKE’s face with a dreamy look on it, then
switch to fantasy montage.

What the fuck? Oh.

Camera pans to focus on MAGGIE behind the bar.

MIKE
She’s fucking gorgeous.

STEVE
She’s OK but that’s not who I was
talking about. {looking around} I
don’t even see her.

MIKE
If I never see another sunrise
again then I can...

STEVE
Ok well that’s great MIKE but I’m
going to get a beer, you can sit
here and recite your bullshit love
letters but I need a beer.

MIKE
Why am I friends with you? Remind
me please.

STEVE

Because it’s my award winning
personality and these mutha-fucking
sexy ass hands! {shit eating grin
present here}

MIKE
What?

STEVE
You heard me, these are fucking
hands of the Gods!

MIKE
Jesus---

STEVE
These my pettin’ and jigglin hands,
know what I mean?

MIKE

STEVE
Seriously MIKE, ask about ’em, I
dare YOU!

The two walk to the bar and have a seat, MIKE is noticeably
uncomfortable and nervous.

MIKE
Dude we don’t have to sit right at
the bar, I mean there’s a couple of
open chairs over there.

STEVE
There’s also a open spot on your
lap. Maybe this little {motioning
towards MAGGIE} alley cat can
oblige you.

MIKE’s retort is cut short when MAGGIE walks over.

MAGGIE
What’s up guys? What can I get for
you?

STEVE
Can I get a beer please and an
answer?

MAGGIE

Um OK, well the beer’s a go but the
answer will probably depend on the
question.

STEVE
{mock hurt} What exactly is it
dependent on?

MAGGIE
{sighing loudly} Really? Well let’s
see. I’m going to assume that since
you are in here together, with a
lack of noticeable female
accompaniment that this answer you
desire more than likely has
something to do with a cheap
attempt at picking me up. I also
noticed your friend here staring
this way with his mouth hanging
open a bit and unless I have a big
booger hanging from my nose, I’m
assuming I was the object of said
staring. Rest assured gentlemen,
the chances of either of you
picking me up or engaging me with
any sort of witty banter that you
might construe as flirting is far
less likely than the chance of you

guys getting a beer. So in the long
run, Simply ordering a beer will
probably be your best shot. I’m
just saying. Anyway now that that’s
out of the way what did you want to
ask me?

STEVE
Um could I have a, um, glass with
this please?

MAGGIE
Sure thing. Coming right up.

MAGGIE returns with a glass and walks off to serve another
CUSTOMER.

STEVE
What a bitch!

MIKE
Really? why would you do that? From
now on whenever she see’s us we’re
going to be those guys, those
fucking guys who tried to pick up
the bartender. Jesus! Really? Don’t
you know about the holy trinity

rule?

STEVE
What the fuck is the holy trinity
rule?

MIKE

The holy trinity rule states that
no matter how much they flirt with
you you never, under any
circumstance, ever try to pick upa
bartender, waitress or a stripper
they flirt only because their job
dictates they do so in order to
make better tips! Jesus Christ!
what’s wrong with you? Stripper,
waitress, BARTENDER (MIKE counts
off on his finger as he names each
one) HOLY FUCKING TRINITY! Now
we’re gonna always be those
assholes who violated the holy
trinity rule, no matter what we do,
she’s always going to see us as
those dudes. Fuck me.

STEVE
Calm down dude, your the one that
was staring at her, besides you
don’t ever leave your house anyway
so why does that even matter?

MIKE
[embarrassed] I was not staring at
her, I just thought maybe I saw
someone that I knew and fuck you.
What do you mean I don’t leave the
house? I don’t even know what I’m
going to do from day to day so how
the fuck do you know what I do.
Now, if you excuse me, I’m off to
attempt some sort of
damage control with her, before
word gets out that we broke the
holy trinity rule. fucker.

19.

MIKE storms off in the direction of MAGGIE who is now at the

end of the bar smoking and cleaning a glass.

MIKE
[nervous] Hi, um remember me from a
second ago, um I’m really sorry to
bug you but, um I just wanted to
apologize for my friend down there.
He can come off kind of strange you
know, well you don’t know, I guess
that’s why I’m here explaining
myself, um but yea I’m really
sorry.

MAGGIE
[laughing] It’s OK, really, I just
like messing with guys sometimes,
it makes this job a little more
manageable at times. Don’t worry
about it, I won’t hold it against
you.

MAGGIE winks at MIKE at the end of her response.

in close and whispers.
MAGGIE
Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone he
violated the trinity rule.

MIKE smiles warmly and blushes.

Oh well thanks, a lot. Um, OK well
like I said I’m really sorry, just
it’s, you know, I, I, I wasn’t
really staring I just didn’t
recognize you, I guess, um---

MIKE mumbles under his breath and stares at his feet and
then blurts out suddenly.

MIKE
My name is MIKE and i used to work
here three years ago and I didn’t
recognize you so I’m sorry!

MAGGIE
[laughing] Well hello my name is
MIKE and I used to work here, my
name’s MAGGIE and I also used to
work here but that was about seven
years ago. It’s very nice to meet
you.

MAGGIE EXT.ends her hand in a hand shake while MIKE, who is
beaming, gingerly takes it.

MIKE
[quietly] your gonna break my heart
aren’t you?

MAGGIE
What’s that?

Nothing. Um I’m going to go sit

Shut up....please.

INT. - BAR - AT THE BAR - DAY

Begins with a series of shots of MIKE walking through the
door and sitting at the bar. The first couple of times he
has to ask for a drink and about the third time of the
sequence MAGGIE has a beer waiting for him.

MIKE
Hey there MAGGIE.

MAGGIE
Hey MIKE, how’s my favorite alcohol
abuser this evening?

MIKE
I’m great, how’s my favorite poison
peddler doing?

MAGGIE
You sure know how to sweet talk a
gal MIKEy my boy.

STEVE comes up behind MIKE and hugs him with a glass of beer
in his hand.

STEVE
Well the fucking party can begin.
MAGGIE serve us up with some of
your finest fire water, you little
minx!

MAGGIE
(laughing)
Coming right up doll.

MIKE
(laughing)
Get off me!

STEVE
(YELLING)
TONIGHT WE DANCE!

MIKE heads over to the jukebox and is putting in money into

the bar jukebox and looking through selections as MAGGIE
comes up behind him and places her hands over his eyes.

MAGGIE
Guess who?

MIKE
Um, let’s see, is it Megan Fox?

MAGGIE
Nope! Cuter.

MIKE
uh, Taylor Swift?

MAGGIE
Ugh! Jeez, your really terrible at
this, you know?

MIKE
okay, okay, I know who it
is...Camille Bell!

MAGGIE hits MIKE in the back of the head with a mock look of
disgust on her face.

She grabs

MIKE
Ow! what the heck? Jeez Hulk, calm
down.

MAGGIE

Well stop being so sucky and I
won’t have to physically abuse you
anymore but remember, I only beat
you to show you how much I care.

MIKE’s arm.

MAGGIE
You tell everyone you got the
bruises from when you fell down the
stairs.

The two of them begin laughing, while MAGGIE slips to MIKE’s
side and casually throws her arm around him. MIKE looks both
uncomfortable and confused at her gesture.

MAGGIE
So what ya playing there mister?

Music begins playing.

MIKE
Well if you must know MS. I am
looking for Allison by With Honors.

MAGGIE
Allison? Really? Holy shit I love
that song!! It’s so pretty. Wow
MIKE, that’s surprising of you.

MIKE
Why?

MAGGIE
Well I never thought you would
listen to something like that.

MIKE
Well, I will have you know---

MAGGIE
Ssh! wait, I love this part (MAGGIE
begins lip synching this song to
MIKE) "Allison, would you wait for
me, would you consider this my
apology---"

MAGGIE begins drifting away from MIKE while dancing and
singing still. A slight smile begins to form at the corner’s
of his mouth. Suddenly the music stops and we hear STEVE.

STEVE
VETO!!! I told you
tonight...we....dance!!!

Punctating his last reMARK, loud, dance music begins
filtering through the Bar.

MIKE
(shouting)
Turn it off!

STEVE
Can’t hear you!

MIKE
Switch it dick!

STEVE
Still can’t---you know, I got this
bum ear and I just can’t hear that

STEVE
Oh Okay. Why didn’t you just say so
from the begining, I got ya, you
wanna dance!

STEVE grabs MIKE by the arms and half drags/pulls him and
starts dancing on him. MIKE keeps trying to shout at him and
act angry but eventually starts laughing and begins dancing
back. MAGGIE mean while is laughing profusely and taking
pictures with a camera. STEVE notices her and grabs her as
well and starts forcing her to dance with them. The scene
fades as the music continues and cuts to a different day.

INT. - BAR - AT THE BAR - NIGHT

Scene 2 - MIKE and MAGGIE are sitting on bar stools and are
talking. They both are laughing and having a good time. They
continue talking and then simultaneously turn their heads
and look off camera to the right, The camera turns and it
reveals STEVE furiously making out with SOME GIRL on the
next bar stool. They eventually fall off the stool and on
the ground. we see MIKE and MAGGIE still watching, laughing
while off camera from the ground a high heel comes flying up
into the shot. MIKE’s face gets a disgusted look while
MAGGIE is still laughing. Both their heads began to turn
sideways as if they are watching the action.

INT. - BAR - TABLES AREA - NIGHT

Scene 3 - MAGGIE is sweeping the bar and MIKE is helping her
mop it as they are continuing to talk and laugh. MAGGIE and
MIKE both stop and together help drag STEVE, who is passed
out drunk on the floor, out of their way and then return to
laughing and talking.

INT. - BAR - AT THE BAR - TOE JOB - DAY

Scene 4- Scene opens with MAGGIE sitting on top of the bar
with her shoes off while MIKE is painting her finger nails
and blowing on them. A CUSTOMER keeps trying to interrupt
the two and MAGGIE keeps blowing him off and ignoring him.
Finally she grabs his cup and throws it off camera into the
background. They resume chatting and MIKE is nodding his
head in agreement. STEVE comes up to the bar with a sad
expression on his face and MAGGIE stares at him and finally
smiles slyly as she reaches behind the bar and grabs him a
bottle of beer. STEVE hi-fives her and skips away grinning,
the music fades their conversation becomes audible.

MIKE
Then I just stopped hearing from
her. I mean, she wouldn’t return my
phone calls, she wouldn’t respond
to myspace messages, it pretty much
sucked. (awkward laugh) Then she
showed up at my door step one day
and just kinda acted like we were
best friends you know. It was, uh,
definitely bizzare, to say the
least.

MAGGIE
That’s fucking terrible! I’m so
sorry MIKE, really that’s
absolutely horrendous. She deserves
all the worst things in life to
happen to her. What a bitch!

MIKE
It’s okay, I suppose, I mean I’ve
made my peace with it, I guess.
I’ve spent the last three years of
my life coming to terms with it.

MAGGIE
Well, at least you guys weren’t
married, you know, things could of
been worse. You could of made my
mistake. It was bad, I almost moved
to Pittsburgh actually, yea that’s
right, Pittsburgh.

MIKE
Why Pittsburgh? That’s kind of
random.
MAGGIE
The Steelers! Duh!
MIKE
Really?
MAGGIE

Why not? If I were to move away
then I would at least move
somewhere where I could watch my
favorite team play.

MIKE
I guess.

MAGGIE
Don’t you dare judge me Mr. I’11
move away for three years because
of some dumb biotch!

MIKE
Okay fair enough but, Yea, I’d been
meaning to ask you about that, I
mean what happened with you guys?

MAGGIE
I guess you could say that we had a
failure to communicate.

MIKE
Was he foreign? Cause I dated this
girl from Russia once with this
thick accent and it was a major
irriation in our relationship. It
sounded like she was talking with a
mouth full of---

STEVE comes in off camera, laughing.

STEVE
By dating he means he once talked
to a girl from Russia on Skype and
by relationship he means they
talked for about 3 hours.

MIKE
Fuck you, she really opened up in
those three hours and we totally
had a connection!

STEVE

Yea, a 56K connection. hay-o.
MIKE

Asshole.
STEVE

Just keeping it real, playa!

MAGGIE
You guys act like your married!

MIKE
STEVE just has the natural ability
to instantly make you wanna laugh
or punch him in his uterus, either
or.

STEVE responds Off-camera.

STEVE
Heard that!

MAGGIE
(laughing)
My situation was a little
different, it takes much more than
a little irration to cause a
divorce.

MIKE
Sorry, I guess it would be.

MAGGIE
No it’s okay, by failure to
communicate I mean more so he
thought it was okay to bang other
girls while I thought that was
morally apprehensive and
disgusting.

MIKE
Wow! What an asshole. You deserve
better than that douche.

MAGGIE
Well appearantly the universe has
other ideas for me. I swear to God
every single good guy I meet is
gay,why is that?

MIKE
Really?! See there is the principle
thing wrong with women today.

MAGGIE
Really Professor MIKE, well please
enlighten me, as to what that may
be.

MIKE
I’m just saying that it’s pretty
suspect that every woman seems to
think that a gay man would be
perfect for them as opposed to a
straight man. Come on really? You
think infidelity and respect are
traits only common among us
heterosexuals? Those traits cross
cultural, gender and sexual
orientational lines. Other foot
please.

MIKE puts a foot down and picks up the other one.

(CONTINUED) www.BarRoomHero.com
www. BarRoomHero.com 28.

MIKE
AS I was saying, don’t you think
it’s interesting that your idea of
the perfect guy is a gay male. Of
course it is, it’s a
non-threatening male with no
ulterior motive of trying to sleep
with you and more than likely he
likes to shop. Of course you feel
safe around him, he’s not going to
try and sleep with you.

MAGGIE
That is a very INT.eresting theory
you have there sir. I may actually
meditate on that a bit, maybe I’11
have a rebuttal for you one day.

MIKE
You may meditate, pray, look at tea
leaves or ask a ouija board but
it’s a undeniable fact just like
the asshole fact.

MAGGIE
Oh yea? Asshole fact? Wait let me
guess, um, "Women only go out with
guys who are assholes." UGH, that
is such a load of shit, you have no
clue.

MIKE
It seems to stand the test of time
though. I mean look, you married
one and stuck around for awhile
even after you found him out for
what he was.

MAGGIE
(laughing)
Oh you jerk! low blow.

MIKE
I’m just saying Ms. I’m trying to
drop that knowledge, you know.

MAGGIE
(laughing)
Well have you ever stopped to
considered that maybe we end up
with assholes because the good guys
are always so quiet and afraid to
speak to us? Come on, I have a

vagina not a gun! It’s not like I’m
going to shoot someone if they ask
me out. At the very worst I’d say
thanks but no thanks.

MIKE
Well your alot nicer than most I
suspect.

MAGGIE

Oh Come on, it’s not like pulling
teeth. You, for example, I never
see you hit on any women in here,
never, and I know you think some of
them are hot, I think some of them
are hot and I love the cock!

MIKE
Well fair enough, but I just don’t
see the point I guess, I mean I see
an attractive woman and I think
well, there she is, I can go hit on
her and more than likely suffer
through a rejection or, through
some random act of God she actually
accepts my overtures, I can only
picture how in the end we’1l just
end up hating each other and then
we’re left with bad memories and
wasted time. It just seems as if
the safest avenue is to just skip
all that entirely and let let
sleeping dogs lie.

MAGGIE is silent for a long time and just staring at MIKE.
MIKE begins to feel awkward and finally speaks.

MIKE
What? Stop staring at me like that.

MAGGIE
Sorry it’s just that I am utterly
speechless and I’m trying to decide
something.

MIKE
Decide what?

Well don’t strain anything
thinking, I can tell you I wouldn’t
know how to run "game" even if i
had it, which i don’t. I’m just
honest.

MAGGIE
I’m begining to see that I think.

MIKE
okay there you are, all done! As if
they were painted by Ralphael
himself!

MAGGIE
Well thank you sir, you are truly a
humanitarian! Now you ready to get
outta here.

MIKE
Rock and roll girl!

MAGGIE begins gathering up her things and begins to shut off
the lights in the bar.

EXT. - BAR - EVENING

Scene 5- MIKE is waiting outside the bar as MAGGIE walks out
and locks the door behind her. MAGGIE locks the door and
turns to MIKE.

MAGGIE
Thanks for the conversation and for
the pretty toe job.

MAGGIE leans in and kisses MIKE on the check and hugs him.
She then waves and walks back to her car. MIKE is left
standing there, shock on his face, as a huge smile creeps
onto his face. MIKE walks to his car and looks around as if
he is forgetting something. Cut to STEVE walking out of the
bathroom to a darkened room.

STEVE
Hello?----Seriously, what the fuck
guys, not cool. Fuck, come on guys,
it’s scary in here.

Long pause.

STEVE
Fuck it! OPEN BAR!

with three other males. Empty and full beer cans litter the
floor.

is that she sounds like she’s

direction. MIKE gets up and heads off camera, presumably for
a beer.

MARK
Dude, seriously look, I’m not being
an asshole, I’m just trying to help
you out here. You’ve only been
dating for like 2 weeks...

KYLE
Actually five months 2 weeks and 4
days

MARK

Jesus Christ man! Sorry 2 weeks or
5 months same shit. I’m trying to
stress the importance of a healthy
independent life style apart from
the significant other. That’s why
there so many divorces in this
country, people get married and
then their too far up in each
others shit and that gets old man.
We are creatures of the hunt, we
need our freedom to roam, we need
those wide open spaces, we are not
to be confined or else...we lose
our shit. We are not meant to be
attached to women, we are meant to
be alone until that day when we
feel a calling to deposit some baby
juice in some lucky lady, [turning
towards JOSH] or a microwaved
banana, no offense JOSH,

MIKE
Leave him alone you jackals. He
found someone who he cares about so
why don’t you congratulate him
instead of riding his ass.

Well, well, well Mr. Sad bastard

MIKE
Sad bastard?! Really? MARK your the
saddest one here, you wait and lurk
around the bar until some poor girl
is drunk enough to make you her
most recent mistake. You don’t even
care about what they look like or
how they are. Your a sexual
seagull, indiscriminate in your
carnal conquests. Can you even
spell love, let alone recognize it?

STEVE tips an imaginary cap in MARK’s direction at the

comment

MARK
I’m a sexual seagull because I
prefer to engage in random sexual
encounters that won’t get muddled
with messy emotions and useless
promises. I’d say I was the smart
one here,besides fuck you, you fell
in love and look what happened, you
fucking moved away for three years
because of it, sounds like I’m
totally missing out on stuff huh?
And I do not lurk. That’s bullshit,
you make me sound like I’m on to
catch a predator or something.

MIKE
I have no regret’s about what has
happened in the past. I prefer to
look at those as training lessons
as opposed to mistakes. In the end,
I like to imagine that those
lessons will prepare me for a
meaningful and more fulfilling
relationship, while your exploits
will merely prepare you for a life
filled with emptiness, hungry man
t.v. dinners and customer of the
year awards from bigmouthfuls.com
and Pole Catz!

Catcalls and laughter

Wait, wait, wait, I never got the
whole story from him, what exactly
happened?

JOSH
Well simply put, our love struck
friend here got into his head that
he was going to ask Jules to marry
him and the day before he planned
on doing it she just stopped
calling him and returning his
calls. Turned up a month later with
a new job, new house and new
boyfriend. Acted like they were
best friends and never explained a
thing. He freaked out and moved
away for the last three years.

KYLE
[softly] fuck me. Why did she do
it?

JOSH

Besides the fact that she’s a
whore? She never said I guess. Just
showed up one day at his apartment
and started acting like nothing had
happened, acted like they had been
just friends all that time.

MARK
And instead of doing what normal
dudes would have done like oh I
dunno, maybe banging some pink
squish or visiting a establish not
unlike Pole Catz, he choose instead
to move away, to a land far far
away and he left us all here
behind.

MARK pauses and looks comically hurt, he then
eighty and continues.

MARK
And speaking of Pole Catz, See
there you were doing it again,
passing judgment on others. I’11
have you know that I’m merely doing
my civic duty by frequenting that
strip club, how else are they going
to pay their college tuition? I

time I would have introduced you to
Bruce Banner and Benjamin Grimm

Shot of MAGGIE rushing inside towards the bar.

MAGGIE
[out of breath] I’m sorry Sus, I
didn’t think I was going to be this
late. That fucking asshole Jon is
making my life a nightmare.

SUSIE
Don’t worry about it, your fine,
it’s not like we’re exactly busy
tonight or anything.

ANNA
Not that you would notice if it
was, remind me again, do you even

SUSIE
Lick me priss.

ANNA
Sorry, I’m not really into herpes.

MAGGIE
Stop you two, please! I have to
argue with Jon all the time, so I
could really use some free time
away from people bitching at each
other.

ANNA
Sorry Maggs.

SUSIE
Yea me too.

MAGGIE
Thanks. I’m just, you know, fucking
done, I’m ready to get the fuck
outta here, just Jon and all this
bullshit behind.

ANNA
What’s he doing now sweetie?

MAGGIE
I don’t know what his fucking deal
is honestly, he’s fucking crazy! If
anything I should be the one who’s
allowed to go crazy. He left me! He
seems to forget that little piece
of information.

SUSIE
Yea, well at least your going
through with it, now the fun part
starts, you get to meet new guys.

ANNA
You do understand that not everyone
solves their problems by jumping
into another guy’s bed?

SUSIE
You do understand that this isn’t
1942 and we aren’t fucking Quakers
right? Women’s liberation does
sound somewhat familiar
right?---Jesus, What the fuck is
your problem, MAGGIE’s going

through a divorce and I think if
she wants to have a little fun than
she can.

ANNA
I understand that Jezabell, I’m
just suggesting that it might be
wiser to hold off on any sort of
relationship, for a bit.

SUSIE
Who said anything about a
relationship? You don’t need a
relationship to get laid!

MAGGIE and Susie high five and laugh.

MAGGIE
Jeez Sus, I’m not trying to be a
hooker but maybe some fun couldn’t
hurt, I mean, I don’t know if I’m
really ready to start actually
dating anyone seriously, I think I
deserve to have some time to myself
after what I’ve put up with.

SUSIE
I’m not trying to make you into a
slut Maggs, I’m just saying that
sometimes a little midnight
encounter doesn’t hurt. Also baby
doll, having sex without being ina
relationship does not make me a
hooker, it---

ANNA
makes you a slut? Cause hookers get
paid at least and---

SUSIE
Fuck off Dorthy, this ain’t fucking
Kansas. Look, MAGGIE, you don’t
need to burden yourself with
another serious guy, just go out
and date and flirt and---FUCK!

MAGGIE
[laughing] Well, I don’t know if I
would exactly put it like that but
I see what your saying...I think.

SUSIE
You do, I’m just saying go out and
live a little, get out there and
have some fun.

ANNA
Maggs don’t listen to her, your
smarter than that. You need to take
some time and deal with yourself
first. Your gonna have some issues
after this divorce, regardless of
the outcome. I just wanna see you
happy.

MAGGIE
Anna, I’m not a fucking mental case
ok, I have and will continue to
deal with Jon and this divorce,
I’1l be fine.

ANNA
I know you will sweetie, I just
want you to be careful.

MAGGIE
I know, I will be.

SUSIE
Okay this is getting a little too
fucking lifetime channel for me.
Tell me the truth, you like anyone?

ANNA
SERIOUSLY! Have you not heard a
thing the past couple minutes,
She’s got a whole bunch of other
stuff on her mind, the last
thing---

MAGGIE
That’s kinda ironic actually
because I’ve been thinking lately,
have you guys noticed those two
guys that come in here all the
time? STEVE and MIKE. Their kinda
bigger guys, kinda young, MIKE’s
got a beard?

SUSIE
STEVE and MIKE huh? You do have a
little devil inside, two for the
price of one’s not bad, you double
the chances of you finishing, kinda
like having a back-up.

ANNA
You are so nasty, Maggs tell me
your not---

MAGGIE

God no! Nothing like that, not both
of ‘em, I just kind of like the
one, you know, I’m kinda---crushing
I guess.

SUSIE
Well no shit! I thought you would
never notice, MIKE totally has a
thing for you, I mean he’s always
here whenever your working, he’s
always talking to you, and you guys
flirt like forever and a day. I
thought I was going to have to hit
you over the head for you to
notice. He seems like a nice enough
guy, I’m sure he could be fun.

ANNA
Wow! I totally agree with Susie,
first time ever I think but yeah
good choice. MIKE seems like a
sweetheart and he totally has the
hots for you.

MAGGIE
Well okay weird but no,actually, I
was kind of talking about his
friend STEVE. I dunno he’s really
cute and well your going to think
that this is weird but I think he
has really sexy hands.

ANNA
That’s, um, yeah that’s actually
really weird. Very weird in fact.

 

SUSIE
I second the weird thing.

MAGGIE
I fucking told you, I know I’ma
little weird. Anyway, I’m not
looking for him to be my boyfriend
or anything, like you said, I’m
just looking for him to be my
little slice of...fun.

(CONTINUED) www.BarRoomHero.com
www. BarRoomHero.com 47.

SUSIE
I agree, actually it’s a fact. My
friend Cheryl went out with him a
few times last year and she said he
was very---attentive towards her
needs. So, good call for your first
post-marriage, booty call.

ANNA
MAGGIE, no! Come on, we just talked
about that stuff, don’t sell
yourself short.

MAGGIE
Anna, I’m not saying I’m gonna go
out and fuck him, I’m attracted to
him that’s all and I’d like to hang
out with him.

ANNA
Well, I guess---

MAGGIE

And you, it does not mean a booty
call, No, not at all. I just want
it to be easy breezy, a non-binding
agreement between two people who
like to have fun. Someone I can
call to hangout or not call them
for awhile. Something along those

lines.

SUSIE
And what would you call that,
excatly?

MAGGIE

[frustrated]I dunno, maybe um, a---
Fuck it! Fine a booty call.

ANNA
MAGGIE!

MAGGIE
Maybe I mean a emotional booty
call, someone to listen to me
complain.

SUSIE

Call it what you want, still a
bootie call baby.

(CONTINUED) www.BarRoomHero.com
www. BarRoomHero.com 48.

MAGGIE
Well calling it that makes it sound
so...bad and dirty. I’m just tired
of being lonely and not having
anyone around. On the same hand
though I don’t really want to get
involved in anything super serious.

SUSIE
Embrace your inner slut, you’1l
feel better, I promise.

ANNA
Fucking nasty bitch!

SUSIE
Oh my God! Anna you just cussed,
you better drop and do 3 hail marys
really quick!

MAGGIE
Leave her alone Sus. Jeez, I swear
your a dude.

SUSIE
I wish I was, If I had a cock, I
would just...fuck, I would just
fuck and hump everything in
sight....starting with your little
hot ass.

Susie begins humping MAGGIE while both girls are laughing.

ANNA
How’s that different from what you
do now? I mean minus the whole cock
having thing?

SUSIE
Aww don’t feel left out, I would
give you a tumble in the sheets,
after a couple of bottles of
whiskey you know? I mean I bet your
not half bad when someone gets you
in the sack.

ANNA
That is none of your business and
besides um, Maggs, I think your
going to run into a little issue
here.

MAGGIE
What’d ya mean?

ANNA
Okay, well his friend obviously has
a thing for you, and guys are
pretty weird about that stuff.

MAGGIE
I don’t think that’s true, MIKE’s a
great guy and we do talk but we so
do not flirt. He’s like a really
cool friend.

SUSIE
Who happens to have a dick.

MAGGIE
(mock disgust)What does that
have to do with anything?

SUSIE
Well it’s scientific proof that any
persons possessing a penis is
incapable of being a platonic
friend with persons possessing a
vagina, and vice versa.

MAGGIE
That’s stupid.

ANNA

Ugh! This is becoming a habit but
she’s right, Come on Maggs, think
about it, you think your going to
be able to actually hang out with
MIKE without him or you actually
developing some sort of feelings
that stretch beyond being platonic?

MAGGIE
YES! Of course I can! Not only am I
capable of developing said
relationship with him, I can also
keep it that way.

SUSIE
Oh, sweetie, that’s so cute, is it
nice there? Are there good schools
and ample parking?

MAGGIE
(confused )Where?

SUSIE
IN FUCKING DENIAL!! Your dreaming,
there’s no fucking way that’s
possible, especially once you tell
him that you want to fuck his
friend and not him.

MAGGIE

You’1l1 see! Next time he comes in
here, I’m gonna ask him to talk to
STEVE for me,see if he can send out
some feelers for me AND THEN I’m
going to ask MIKE if he wants to
hang out this weekend. Watch! There
is a perfectly acceptable balance
here that can be maintained!

ANNA
Maggs, someone’s gonna hurt, you
know that?

SUSIE

So what? You know what, the more I
think about i, the more it makes
sense. Who cares about MIKE, if
he’s going to be a big pussy about
everything then, oh well.

MAGGIE

I care about MIKE, he’s my friend
and this is a moot point because he
doesn’t like me like that. He
thinks the same of me as I do him,
okay, we are simply friends.

 

ANNA
Well, here’s your chance to prove
it.

MAGGIE

[looking where Susie is] what are
you talking about....oh, Oh
shit.[Turing towards Susie] Don’t

So? Did you say something yet? Did

MAGGIE
That’s disgusting Sus, Jesus, come

Don’t you dare think about backing

playing sexy fingers though.

Both girls start laughing while STEVE and MIKE stare at them

STEVE
So, you going to actually say
something to her tonight?

MIKE
I think I am, I mean I’m
twenty-seven years old dude, I’m to
old to play games right? I’m just
gonna lay it all out there.

MIKE
Seriously, what the fuck is wrong
with you? I’m not whipping my dick
out, I meant that I’m going to lay
out the way I feel about her, I’m
going to use words and phrases and
possibly an analogy or two. My
penis is staying in my pants OK?
That OK with you? Your a future sex
offender dude, you realize this
right?

STEVE
Whatever dude. Go head, do it your
way, I’m sure millions of gay guys
get laid talking about their
emotions and feelings, and
butterflies and rabbits. Your
right, I’m super stoked for you,
good luck.

MIKE
I seriously don’t understand why
we’re friends, I really don’t, we
are so each others opposite. I mean

yourself with all this bullshit
anxiety, just go in there and get
it out of the way.

That’s easy for you to say man but
I don’t operate that way. I can’t

a really long time, way before I
even filed for a divorce. The truth
is that, I just haven’t really had
a chance to have fun in awhile. I
haven’t been able to really enjoy
myself or just...or just be. It
seems like the past three years
have been full of nothing but drama
and I’m ready to cut loose, you

have you as my friend, I mean I
finally get someone to hang out

Yea yea, I understand, totally, you
deserve to be able to enjoy

Exactly! So I was wondering if,
maybe, you could maybe say
something to STEVE about me, that
would be so awesome. I think he’s
funny and just so adorably cute, I
think we could have so much fun
together. I don’t want anything

can kind of hang out with every
know and then when I need a hand or
something, just something easy and

MAGGIE
[hurt] Christ MIKE, don’t say it
like that, you make me sound like a
whore!

MIKE
No, No, I don’t mean anything
negative, I’m just saying, You
don’t want any attachments or
anything and...

MAGGIE
I’m just fucking with you MIKE. I
don’t like that term but I guess in
reality that’s pretty fair.

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
So, do you think he’1l be
INT.erested? I mean, I’ma
twenty-nine year old divorcee, I
don’t even know if he’1l want
anything to do with me?

MIKE begins to down all the shots in a one, two, three
Manner and the astonishment shows on MAGGIE’s face.

MIKE
Um yea, I know he’1l be
INT.erested, um, in fact I’1ll go
talk to him right now, trust me,
he’s an idiot if he’s not into you.

MAGGIE
No! You don’t have to do it now, I
mean it can wait, I don’t want you
to embarrass him or something in
front of all your friends, MIKE it
can wait!

MIKE waves away her comment as he walks towards the back of
the bar.

STEVE
Dude how’d it go? I saw her smiling
all the way back her, dude, you did
it right?!

MIKE
Well not quite sure, I think we’re
bff’s now but um just Follow me
outside. Don’t ask questions, just
come outside.

STEVE follows MIKE outside quietly.

22 EXT. - BAR - PATIO - EVENING

STEVE
Dude, so, um what the fuck? What
happened up there? You Ok?

MIKE
Well she likes somebody, I mean
it’s not exactly what I expected or
anything but I don’t know man.

STEVE
Oh shit dude. She’s dating someone
isn’t she? I fucking knew it, I
fucking knew man. She sits there
and flirts with you the whole time
and she’s fucking dating some other
douche bag, what the fuck, I...

MIKE
No dude, it’s not exactly that, she
likes...

STEVE

Fuck it man, just fucking forget
about her man. We’1l grab the guys
and go hit the titty bar. You’1ll
forget about her real quick with a
nice pair of fat-boys in front of
you. We’1l get Russell Crowe drunk
dude, we’ll be in-fucking-vincible.
Trust me, I know what you need
right now dude, you don’t need that
fucking...

MIKE
[Angry] Dude will you shut the fuck
up for a second! I’m trying to tell
you what she said. She likes you!
She wants you to be her, her
fucking booty call! oh shit, I just
gagged a little there.

STEVE
What! Really,...me?...wow!

MIKE
Yeah. I know, That’s kinda fucked
up huh?

STEVE

Dude, I don’t know what to say, I’m
sorry man really.

MIKE
Dude, it’s okay man, really, I
think you should go for it, really,
you guys deserve it. I mean she did
tell me she wanted me to be her
friend.

STEVE
The fuck does that mean?

MIKE
My guess is she likes me but not
physically, so that I don’t fill
that particular requiem, however
she enjoys hanging out me, so she
wants you to do that. I dunno, I
don’t fucking get it really.

STEVE
I’m so confused.

MIKE
Like Superman. Lois didn’t want to
fuck Clark, she wanted to fuck
Superman but she would go shopping
and hang out with Clark. I’m
fucking Clark Kent.

STEVE
So then, I’m Superman and your
Clark?

MIKE

Well in a manner of speaking, um
yeah, I guess and fuck you.

STEVE
Just joking dude and by the
way...Are you fucking nuts! I’m not
going to do that, what the fuck?
You’ve totally been obsessed with
her, I wouldn’t do that to you.

MIKE
I appreciate the sentiment, I
really do but listen. Yes I am
totally into her but dude she’s
been going through a lot and I mean
fuck, whatever she deserves a
little bit of happiness. Your the
same way, I know you think she’s
hot, so why would I stand in the
way. Besides I mean, you know I

really do enjoy her company so
maybe this is for the better. Nine
times out of ten I end up not
talking to broads after I date em
anyways so maybe this is for the
better. you know?

STEVE
That’s kind of fucked up though, I
can’t do that to you man, that’s
just, that’s not right.

MIKE
If you can tell me you don’t think
she’s attractive and not be a
fucking liar about it then I’11
leave it alone but don’t fucking
not do this because of me. I’m
telling you to go ahead and do
this, it’s not an issue with me. If
I couldn’t have her then at least
my best friend can get her.

STEVE
Dude, I don’t know...what...

MIKE
Seriously. This is really okay, i
promise. She’s not my property, I
don’t own her, it’s not like I can
pick and choose what she does or
who she likes. Why would I stand in
the way of you two because I have
some foolish little crush.

STEVE
Dude she is kinda attractive
but....dude I dunno.

MIKE
It’s OK, if you want to do it, then
go ahead, go talk to her. Trust me
it’s OK. I’m gonna get out here
anyway so no worries. Good luck.

STEVE
You sure?

MIKE
Yeah, totally dude, think about it
if you want but I mean, do it,
really, I’m cool don’t worry about
man.

INT. - BAR - EVENING

The camera follows MIKE as he walks back in and heads to the
bar and speaks with MAGGIE for a few minutes. MAGGIE looks
excited and she hugs and kisses him again. MIKE awkwardly
hugs her back and then moves towards the exit door while
MARK, JOSH, and KYLE make gestures towards him, which he
ignores. The screen splits into fours as

one square shows MIKE walking sadly to a car.

The second square shows the confused looks of their friends
at the table.

The third square shows a happy looking MAGGIE.

The fourth shows a very confused looking STEVE.

Then a shot of a filthy room with fast food wrappers and
other junk littering the floor. MIKE is sitting on the floor

shabbily dressed individual, the camera finally reveals that

bust in his door.

JOSH
Where the fuck have you been?

MARK
More importantly why does it look
like you’ve been blowing big bird?

MIKE
I don’t wanna really talk about it.
[looking around] where the fuck is
that bottle at?

JOSH
Dude, seriously, you need some help
man, you smell like my grandpa Ed.

MARK
I was wondering why it smelled so
familiar in here. How’s he doing by
the way?

JOSH
Oh not bad, I mean he got a hip
replacement a few months ago but
other than that he’s not too bad.

MARK
Jeez, I keep meaning to get over
there and see him but it seems like
every time I plan on going over
there something pops up.

JOSH
Yeah, you should pop in and see
him, I know that would make his
day.

MARK
I need to, I know. I was just
remembering the other day that time
when he came over our apartment
without any pants on and he...

At this point MIKE has found his bottle and is taking swigs
from it.

MIKE
Look, can you guys take the
catch-up conversation else where,
I’m trying to wallow in self pity
over here and it’s kind of hard
with you two ladies
jibber-jabbering.

JOSH
Shit, sorry dude, forget what we
were doing here.[Clears throat] Um,
so anyways, we’re here because
we’re worried about you, I mean we
haven’t seen you in like two weeks
then here you are huffing fucking
spray-paint and drinking cheap ass
whiskey.

MARK
Seriously, maybe that shit’s fun
when your like 12 but really dude
come on? Your better than that. You
haven’t even talked to STEVE in
forever man, he’s really worried.

MIKE
Fuck that! STEVE can go fuck
himself and that stupid broad. And
how dare you fucking judge me,
maybe I happen to enjoy huffing
spray paint and drinking cheap
whiskey, I don’t say shit about
your guy’s weirdly homo-erotic
relationship, do I?

JOSH

Fuck you asshole! That’s what this
shit is all about? Huh? This is all
about some girl, Your living like a
fucking homeless man because STEVE
is dating some girl who, mind you,
you told him to go ahead and date
anyways?

MARK
Don’t get shitty with us because we
make the mistake of giving a shit
about you.

MIKE
Wait! What did you just say?

MARK
Yeah I know right, big surprise we
actually give a shit about you.

MIKE
No dip shit, not you.[pointing in
JOSH’s direction] What did you just
say, about STEVE and MAGGIE.

JOSH
[looking Perplexed] what are
you...what that their dating?

MIKE
JESUS, MARY AND FUCKING JOESPH! You
gotta be shitting me. Son of a
bitch!

MIKE begins pacing around the room and mumbling color
phrases and random curses. JOSH leans in close to MARK and
begins speaking.

JOSH
Wow! He’s, um, he’s fucked up.

MARK
Well thanks John fucking Madden for
the ever so keen observation.

JOSH
Excuse me Dr. Phil, I never knew
you were so gifted in the area of
telling someone their best friend
is dating their dream girl.

Any further retort is INT.errupted by the sound of glass
shattering. MIKE is standing over the remains of a shattered
lamp.

MIKE
This is bullshit, this is total
fucking bullshit, he didn’t even
like her! He wanted to fuck the
other one. [pointing at MARK] This
is all my fault. I should of walked
into that bar and pulled a STEVE. I
should of walked up to her, pulled
my dick out, slapped it against her
forehead a little, I dunno, then
maybe rubbed it against her ass for
good measure. I mean that’s what he
would of done, she obviously likes
that. FUCK! I should of just tried
to be an asshole, if I would
treated her like shit, then I bet
she would of wanted to suck me off
right in front of all of you. Fuck!

MARK

Come on dude, STEVE’s not the
asshole here and it’s not your
fault. I mean he told YOU, he

specifically told you that he
wasn’t going to do it. He said he
would decline because he knew YOU
liked her. You said go for it. Why
the FUCK are you sitting here and
crying over spilled milk?

MIKE runs over to MARK and grabs the front of his shirt as
if he is pleading with him.

MIKE
THEY WERE JUST SUPPOSED TO BE FUCK
BUDDIES! Is that understandable? is
my voice triggering the
neurotransmitters in your ears? Is
your brain correctly INT.erpreting
the various pulses and charges
their sending to it? Can you
understand....the..... words....1I
am..... speaking?

MARK
Fuck you! What I don’t understand
is what’s the fucking difference?
Their either fucking with or
without a relationship? So what?
They’re still
f...uU...C...kK...i...n...g!

MIKE
You sir, are an idiot.

MIKE runs his hand through his hair and lights a cigarette.
He inhales and then exhales slowly.

MIKE
Look, if they just had a booty call
arrangement then yes, that would be
fine. The fact is that they are now
in a committed relationship...and
still bumping nasties in the
process. i figured they would fuck
for awhile and then she would get
bored and then move to look for a
more meaningful relationship. Or
she would tire of his alpha male,
borderline chauvinistic behavior
and want a more caring and
nurturing guy. We all know that I
am fucking Mr. Meaningful

FUCKING nurturing and CARING! The

MIKE (cont’d)
fact that they are ina
relationship is a death sentence
against us being together. That
kills any sort of shot I ever had
with her. I mean they changed the
rules of the game midway through
the second quarter. They called a
fucking audible. Now that their
together, their gonna spend more
time together, which is natural.
Then their gonna start having
feelings for each other. Then
someone in their family is gonna
die and guess who’s their to
comfort them? Oh that’s right they
are! That’s only going to feed
their closeness, shortly there
after she’s gonna get pregnant and
he’s going to tell her to keep it
because he LOVES her. That leads to
marriage, which then leads to
JOINT. bank accounts which then
leads to mortgages which then turns
into college funds which then turns
into life insurance which becomes
20th wedding anniversary which may
or may not lead to death or
divorce. So I either get to watch
them grow old and be happy together
or I get to finally have a crack at
it when I’m 55 and smell like beef
jerky and cabbage. Either way I’m
fucked!

 

 

JOSH
Did you just say you were the king
of fuck? Cause I’m pretty sure you
did.

MARK
Shut the fuck up JOSH. (turning
towards MIKE) So your implying that
the only reason you gave STEVE the
green light was because you were
counting on him to fuck it up?

MIKE

I’m not implying anything, I’m
saying that WAS the reason!

(CONTINUED) www.BarRoomHero.com
www. BarRoomHero.com 75.

MARK
Not for nothing dude but that was a
really stupid idea, not to mention
that’s a kinda shitty thing to do
to a friend. Besides you were
willing to settle for sloppy
seconds?

MIKE
I had no clue that they would
actually end up dating. STEVE never
gives a shit about women usually,
how the fuck was I supposed to
know? That girl is something
special man, I would take the
sloppiest of sloppy seconds if it
meant I could be with her.

MIKE begins to pace around the room again and mumbling.
MARK and JOSH are just staring at him with a look of
uncertaINT.y and disdain. Finally MIKE looks up and speaks.

MIKE
This is seriously fucked, Dude I’m
fucked here man. I really don’t
know what to do.

JOSH
In reality, what can you do?

MIKE
I moved back here with nothing,
with fucking nothing. I’ve hated
this place since day one, and look
I’m back. There was nothing here
for me, NOTHING!

MARK
Well gee MIKE fuck you too! what,
you don’t have friends anymore.

MIKE
You guys are different, you guys
are my friends and I love you but
aside from that there was nothing
here. My life wasn’t supposed to be
like this, I was supposed to be
gone now, living by the ocean,
getting up everyday and smelling
the salt in the air and seeing the
palm trees everyday. Instead I wake
up everyday smelling refined oils
and tasting the metal in the air.

JOSH
What does this have to do with
MAGGIE?

MIKE

Everything! I hated my life! I
hated being here then I meet
here.You know then I met her and I
got to know her. Fuck man, she
actually made it seem as if this
place wasn’t so bad. She gave me a
reason to stick around. Now, what
the fuck, I’m back to square one.

MARK
Listen, fuck that! You can’t
fucking live your life for someone
else! What was gonna happen if you
guys broke up? What were you going
to run away again? Seriously? F
that. You need to decide what you
want, without including someone
else into the equation.

MIKE
I want her! That’s what I want!
Her!

MARK

Well that’s not gonna happen man,
so it’s time to suck it up and stop
this shit! Your fucking better than
this, you are, you deserve way more
than what you got going on now.
Think about it.

A long silence follows while MIKE appears to be doing just
that.

MIKE
Fuck it man, you know, just fuck
it. Your right, your both right. I
need to get it together.what’s done
is done I guess, you know hopefully
they make each other happy I guess.
I’ve been acting like a douche I

you a money shot.

MARK and MIKE exit the room while JOSH lingers behind
looking suspicious.

JOSH
You guys go head, um, I’1l be out
there in a minute, I just gotta,
um, use the bathroom.

JOSH begins looking around and picks up the can and spray
paint gingerly. He sprays a little bit in the bag and takes
a tiny huff. His eyes widen and a tiny smile spreads on his
lips as he sprays in a much longer spray.

INT. - BAR - NIGHT

Scene opens with MARK and MIKE sitting at a hi top littered
with bottles.

MIKE
Dude, I dunno, I guess I just moved
back here expecting the worst and
it was like that for awhile, you
know, but then I met MAGGIE and it
just all changed, I kind of maybe
thought that she might make this
place a little more tolerable.

MARK
Fuck that, listen, why are you
depending on someone else to make
your life worth while man. so what?
Big fucking deal, you moved away
and in the end had to move back.
There’s no shame in that, just now
you know what to expect when you
try again next time. If your
unhappy here then no one else is
ever going to be able to truly
change that. Maybe it’1l help you
deal for a little bit but in the
end your going to find yourself
right back where you are now.

MIKE
I guess so. This place just sucks
the fucking life from you man, I
mean look around. This place is a
black hole, it sucks you in. Your
born and raised here, you end up
marrying someone from here, next
thing you know you have kids and
bills, you just can’t pack up and
leave anymore. next thing you know
your working in the fucking mill,
just living check to check, trying
to make ends meet while your kids
are growing up and falling into the
same trap.

JOSH enters the frame behind them yelling and generally
causing a ruckus. There’s paint smeared around his mouth and
he has wild eyes.

JOSH runs

JOSH
WOOOOOHOOO0000! I fucking love this
place! FUCK YEA! (pointing off
camera) YOU! I don’t even know YOU
but fuck, I love you, give daddy a
hug!

off camera again, leaving MARK and MIKE alone.

MIKE
Jesus Christ!

MARK
(laughing)
I fucking love that guy. Look
seriously, STEVE’s your best friend
you know, I mean don’t let this
situation ruin it. It’s just a
girl, you know?

MIKE

I know dude, I know but, just one
time, I’d really like things to go
my way for a change, I’d like to
see things work out for me. I guess
I maybe just saw her as being a
sort of make-up for having to move
back home. It seemed like it might
have almost been worth it, I guess.

The conversation is INT.errupted by KYLE entering the bar
and walking up to the table.

KYLE
Well, well sirs, look who decided
to come up for air. You know we had
bets on you.

What kind of bets?

KYLE
Well 3-1 said you joined the priest
hood, um, 2-1 said you were joining
the Zapata rebellion in Chiapas the
10-1 long shot was that you stuck
your head in the oven and no one
had the noticed the smell yet.

MIKE
With friends like these, fuck.

KYLE
I took the priesthood spread, FYI.

you to go talk to him.

Silence as MIKE stares at him and STEVE looks at the ground
again.

MIKE
Oh thank God. I don’t think I could
deal with you guys being together.

STEVE
(confused)
I thought you just said that you
wanted us to be happy?

MIKE
Fuck. That’s just something you say
to a friend because they wanna hear
it. It’s like telling a girl she
doesn’t look fat in something when
she obviously does. You know, when
she wears a skin tight shirt
thinking it looks good, but her
hips look like an unevenly baked
muffin top. Or how you tell her
that yea, cuddling is better than
sex.

STEVE

Your fucking crazy, you know that?

See, if you guys were together than
I could handle it, your my friend,
she’s awesome, I’d put up with it,
it would still suck but I’d endure.

know, once you pop you can’t stop.

STEVE
That would be a good slogan for
drug dealers, they should co-opt
it.

MIKE
(laughing)
Right?...So Are you okay? you look
beat up?

STEVE
I’m good, just, I’m worried about
her, she got kinda attached...
emotionally. That’s why I had to
end it, i didn’t feel the same way.
It was fine just having a booty
call, but I’m no good for her if
she wants a relationship, it’d be
unfair to her.

MIKE
Jeez, I’m really, honestly sorry
man. At least you did the right
thing though. You could of dragged
it on for awhile just for sex.

STEVE
I know, I’m just worried about her
she’s in really bad shape man. I’m
worried she’s gonna do something
stupid.

MIKE
She’s really that bad?

STEVE
Really. I’m not trying to be
conceited but she’s still got
issues with the ex and then now all
this stuff with me, I just don’t

prolly just head in here and have a
couple. Thanks though.

STEVE gets up and starts heading towards the doors of the
bar.

MIKE
Hey!

STEVE turns around and looks at MIKE

MIKE
Gimme a call tomorrow, we’1ll go
grab a beer.

STEVE
Sounds good man.

STEVE walks into the bar and MIKE climbs into his car. He
starts it and starts fiddling with radio. As he prepares to
leave his cell phone rings.

MIKE
Hello?

MIKE
hey you.

MIKE

no I’m actually leaving the bar
now. what’s up?

MIKE
yea sure, is everything OK?

MIKE
yea, how do I get there?

MIKE
Ok, cool, I’1l be there in a bit.

MIKE hangs up the phone and looks blankly out the window.

MIKE
(softly)
fuck me.

EXT. - MAGGIE’S HOUSE - MIKE’S CAR - WALKS TO DOOR - NIGHT

MIKE is sitting outside MAGGIE’s house in his car staring
ahead blankly. We see the door is open to her house and we
can hear soft music floating through the air from her house.
MIKE get’s out and slowly makes his way to the open front
door.

INT. - MAGGIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

MIKE lets himself in and surveys the dimly lit room before
calling out. Inside the house there are boxes all over the
place and the house is strangely empty.

MIKE
Hello? MAGGIE? Magg’s? Where are
you?

INT. - MAGGIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

The sound of of soft crying carries from the kitchen and
MIKE follows it to the kitchen where he finds MAGGIE sitting
with her knees pulled to her chest. She is softly sobbing.

MIKE
Uh, MAGGIE? Is everything okay? Um,
the door was open so I just kinda
came in, didn’t know if that was
cool or not, so I hope it was.

MAGGIE
(in between sobs and sniffles)
MIKE it’s okay, I think maybe it’s
better if you leave though, I’m not
in good shape you know. I’m sorry I

MAGGIE (cont’d)
called you, I think that was a
mistake.

MIKE lowers himself to a sitting position beside her.

MIKE
Well it’s true that you’ve prolly
had um, better days but you kinda
have this whole Nancy Kerrigan
crying "why" thing going on and
I’ve always had a thing for her so
I think I’1l stick around.

MAGGIE
(laughing)
You jerk. Fuck MIKE, what happened?
Everything got soo fucked up so
fast, I can barely comprehend it
myself. I think I’m crazy.

MIKE
Your not, stop that. I’m not sure
what happened either, I just
actually talked to STEVE right
before you called and he kinda
explained everything and, um, I’m
sorry about the way things happened
between you two.

MAGGIE
Really? What the fuck did he have
to say?

MIKE

Um, well, nothing really just that
you got emotionally attached and he
had to uh, um, end it tonight, and
he said he was worried about you
though, he did make that clear.

MAGGIE
That piece of shit!! I got
emotionally attached!! Asshole
neglected to tell you that he did
too, he didn’t mention that he said
"I love you" first or that he was
thinking about moving in here huh?
What a son of a bitch!

MIKE
I guess in the confusion he must,
have, um, neglected to mention
those---tid bits.

MAGGIE
Seriously?! I’m fucking cursed, it
figures this would happen, I
mean--- (begins crying) What the
hell is wrong with me MIKE? What
have I done to deserve all of, all
of this, this bullshit?---I try so
fucking hard, I really do, I mean,
I just want things to actually work
for me, you know?

MIKE
Stop, please? This isn’t your
fault, you didn’t do anything
wrong, I swear!

MAGGIE
Then tell me what’s wrong please?
Please MIKEy, tell me what the fuck
is wrong with me? Why am I doomed
to be left? why does everyone
always leave me? It hurts, it hurts
so fucking much.

MIKE puts his arm around MAGGIE and pulls hugs her to
himself.

MIKE
Hey, listen to me, listen, you are
the problem! There is nothing wrong
with you! Fuck everyone else! You
are so amazing and special, don’t
you ever forget that. If nobody
else can see that then, their loss.

MAGGIE
Is’s just too much sometimes, I
feel like, I feel like I’m ina
fucking chinese finger trap
everytime I try to do something to
help myself or I try to struggle
through my problems, it just get’s
tighter. I’m fucked no matter what
I do. Maybe that’s the reality I
should face, maybe I should just
realize that it’s not going to get
any better, maybe I shouldn’t
expect anything better, maybe it’s
time I call it quits, I just----I
just wanna die.

MIKE

(angered)
Don’t fucking talking talk like
that, hear me, don’t you ever say
something stupid like that again.
Everything may not be better in the
morning and it may not be better in
a few weeks, but goddammit,
everything will be okay at some
point -

MAGGIE
How do you know?! How the fuck can
you say something like that? How do
you know! You don’t even really
know anything about me!

MIKE
I know enough to know that I
fucking love you! I know it breaks
my heart to see you like this. I
know that everything is going to be
alright because I’m going to make
sure it is!

MAGGIE
(laughing softly)
What MIKE, you going to be my
Guardian Angel? You going to be my
very own, personal Michael Landon?

MIKE
Maybe! Maybe I’1l be better than
Michael Landon, maybe I’11
be---fucking---Michael Landon on
‘roids!

MAGGIE
MIKE, I just, I don’t know why I
called you, there’s nothing you can
do really, I mean I just have to
work this out on my own. I have to
figure out my own crazy.

MAGGIE gets up off the ground at this point and puts her
head on the kitchen counter and begins crying again. MIKE
gets up off the ground also and begins to lightly rub her
back.

MIKE
Magg’s, your not crazy and you
don’t have to work it out by
yourself, I wanna be here, I wanna
help you---

(CONTINUED) www.BarRoomHero.com

MAGGIE whirls around and cuts off MIKE’s words. Her face is
mixture of anger and bewilderment.

MAGGIE
Help me do what MIKE? You wanna
help me get better?! Is that what
you want to help me do? You want to
play the role of the hero? You
wanna save little ol me from myself
and the big bad world? You gonna
keep me safe MIKEy boy?

MIKE
MAGGIE, I didn’t, um, I didn’t mean
it like that, I just---

MAGGIE
Oh, ok, I get it, You REALLY wanna
help me huh? You wanna help me
right out of these clothes right?

MIKE
I never fucking said any---

MAGGIE
You wanna help me though huh? Well
here let me HELP you HELP me. Does
this help?

MAGGIE starts removing her shirt and pants and throws them
at MIKE one at a time as she emphsizes each "help".

MIKE
Please stop, okay, just fucking
stop. I didn’t want any this to
happen, not like this.

MAGGIE
What MIKE? You think because your
friend fucked me you could come
over here and show me a little
pity, maybe tell me some sweet
things and then you’d be able to
slide right in where STEVE was?!
You think maybe I’m like a fucking
Kmart Blue light special, two for
the price of one?! Well fuck you
and fuck you, there’s two for the
price of one MIKE, it’s your lucky
day!

Waste of time? You fucking better

wasting your time. Telling me you
love me and shit, that’s so fucking
weak MIKE, fuck you man, I thought
we were friends, just get the fuck
outta here, I maybe open but I’m
closed for business.

MIKE gives MAGGIE a final look goodbye and walks out the

door.

EXT. - MAGGIE’S HOUSE - MIKE’S CAR -

MIKE leans against his car outside and glances at the house.

He leans his head back and inhales deeply.

FLASHBACK TO:

The scene cuts to a brief montage of the time MIKE and
MAGGIE had spent together set to music.

We cut back to MIKE against the car

he looks at the house

again and he shrugs his shoulders and speaks a soft "fuck

determined.

A startled MAGGIE is on the floor crying and holding a
bottle of wine and she speaks.

MAGGIE
I thought I told you---
MIKE
First thing’s first, fuck you!
MAGGIE
Well Fuck---
MIKE

Now your going to listen! You
called me over here, so now your
going to listen to me. Don’t try
and use the time that I’m talking
to think of another clever reMARK,
use it to think about what I’m
telling you. I’m not here to fuck
you! That’s not the reason I came,
I’m here because, like I said I
give a shit about you! Yes, I know
that it sounds impossible to you
but yes, I care about you and I’m
not trying to fuck you! Guess
what?! Life sucks, life sucks a big
one, and one way or another we all
get fucked in the end. It’s no
surprise, it’s going to happen and
sometimes it happens alot! I’m
living proof!

MAGGIE
Is this supposed to---

MIKE
Stop! Just listen. I fucking love
you! I fell in love with you the
moment I laid eyes on you, I’ve
known since day one. I’ve also
known that the chances of someone
like you and someone like me
happening were nil. FUCK! Talk
about getting fucked over by the
world, the one girl who made this
fucking pit stop of town seem
worthwhile and she goes and falls
for my best friend! The last good
thing about this town and she liked
STEVE!

MAGGIE
MIKE, I’m sorry, I had no---

MIKE holds up his hand to stop her and he continues.

MIKE
It’s my fault, I never said
anything but I told STEVE to go
ahead and pursue it if he was
INT.erested. You know why? Because
you had put up with so much
bullshit lately that I figured
well, hey fuck it, if this is what
it takes to make her happy then,
fuck it, she deserves it! And I get
to be her friend at least, so it
was win win. You fucking light up
my life! You do that to me. I went
to the bar just to see you! You
were the only reason I had on
several occassions to keep going! I
looked forward to just being around
you, that kept me going. So now I’m
returning the favor, I wanna be
that person that you lean on when
you need help, I’m here for you,
and I’m not trying to fuck you, I’m
here as your friend because at the
end of the day, when all the
bullshit’s done, that’s who sticks
around...your friends.

MAGGIE gets up off the ground and hugs MIKE and begins
crying in earnest.

MAGGIE
I’m so sorry, I had no idea, I’m
really sorry.

MIKE
It’s okay really, just, it’s okay.
I promise.

MAGGIE lifts her head and her nose is touching MIKE’s nose,
their lips are inches apart.

MAGGIE
MIKE, why, why do you care?

There is a couple seconds of silence as MAGGIE and MIKE
never break intense eye contact.

I hope you don’t think I’m some

MIKE
Never that Ms. Maybe a

after....um the last...two hours.

The two of them start laughing and she leans over and gives
him a quick kiss.

MAGGIE
I just want you to know that last
night meant alot to me, and the
things you said to me were more
than likely the nicest things
anyone had ever said to me, ever!

MIKE
I meant every single word I said.
You don’t have to thank me, I was
scared actually.

MAGGIE
Why? Why would you have been
scared? You should of said those
things earlier maybe things would

I wasn’t scared about that, and no,
I think this happened at the right

sooner the timing wouldn’t had been
right and it just, you know stuff
happens when it’s supposed to, not
when we want it to but when it’s
meant to happen. you know?

MAGGIE stares at MIKE for a second INT.ently and then she
smiles slightly.

They both

MAGGIE
I like that, I do and it makes
perfect sense. Now answer my
question jerk, what were you scared
about?

MIKE
It’s stupid but, well, I guess I
was scared about just barging in
the second time last night, I mean
you were so pissed that I didn’t
know if you were gonna mace me, hit
me with a bat or fucking punch me,
you totally hulked out on me last
night, I felt like Whitney and you
were Bobby.

MAGGIE
MIKE, I want you to know, that,
well, I’ve never met someone like
you before, I really mean that.

Well, thanks---I think.

up and get ready.

MIKE
Oh---Okay, at least that’s going to
be one worry off your mind.

MAGGIE
Your ain’t lying, I may cry again
but at least this time it’1ll be
tears of fucking sweet, swwet

MIKE
Well, what are you doing later?
Maybe we can grab a drink or maybe
just watch a movie? I mean if you
don’t want to that’s totally fine,
you know, I understand.

MAGGIE
Um, yea---we can meet up at the
bar, that sounds cool. Wanna meet
me around 9ish?

INT. - MIKE’S HOUSE - ON PHONE - DUSK

The scene opens with music is playing throughout the whole
scene and there is no audible dialogue, a split screen of
MIKE talking on his phone

EXT. - MAGGIE’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DUSK

and the other screen is MAGGIE walking a box into a waiting
van outside.

INT. - MIKE’S HOUSE - SHOWER - DUSK

MIKE then moves around his house and is in an excited state.
Eventually, MIKE makes his way into the bathroom with a
towel and he is assumingly showering.

INT. - MAGGIE’S HOUSE - WRITES NOTE - KITCHEN - DUSK

MAGGIE is looking concerned and keeps glancing at her watch.
She walks back into the now empty house and leans against
the counter and begins writing on a piece of paper. As tears
begin to form she continues to write.

INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM? - DUSK

The screen fills in so that MIKE’s scene is the only one
visible, he is now fully dressed and is whistling as he is
grabbing things off of his dresser like a wallet, keys,
cigarettes, etc. He sprays himself with cologne and walks
out of his bedroom and the camera focuses on a digital clock
which reads 8:45.

EXT. - MIKE’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY? - DUSK

The scene cuts to a split shot again as MIKE is walking to
his car and

INT. - BAR - MAGGIE’S WALK - DUSK

MAGGIE is walking into the bar. As MIKE gets into his car,
MAGGIE’s half of the screen fills the entire screen and it
follows her as she walks through the bar and ignores hi’s
and hello’s from people inside including STEVE and all the
friends. She walks up to Susie and hands her an envelope and
says something to her. Susie looks confused but nods her
head and then MAGGIE wipes away tears and gives Susie a big

hug. The camera follows her on her way out and into her car
as she pulls away and drives off. The camera stays on her
parking spot when seconds later

INT. - BAR - MIKE’S WALK - DUSK

MIKE pulls into the same spot. He gets out and walks into
the bar with camera behind him. He first see’s STEVE who’s
head is in between some ladies breasts and she is laughing.
STEVE’s head comes up as MIKE grips his shoulders and the
gives his head a hug. He then moves on and is saying hello
to random people and passes by JOSH and MARK. MARK is
yelling at JOSH about something and JOSH gives a stupid grin
and wave at MIKE. There is still yellow residue around his
mouth and MARK is yelling at him and gesturing to a brown
bag in his hand. MARK pauses in yelling to give MIKE a hand
shake and goes back to yelling at JOSH. MIKE walks by KYLE
and slaps him on the back as KYLE is holding hands and
staring into the eyes of his girlfriend. KYLE gives a quick
introduction and MIKE shakes her hand and gives her a quick
peck on the cheek and continues towards the bar. MIKE passes
a table and as he passes we see the Woman #1 from the
beginning blind date give MIKE a black look and is sitting
with a guy, RICK, who is wearing a "Rick Rules" t-shirt and
a head band and wrist bands. MIKE walks up to the bar and
Susie immediately comes up to him and says something to him.
MIKE get’s a puzzled look on his face and Susie hands him a
envelope. MIKE opens the letter and begins reading,
instantly his face drops and he looks destroyed. He finishes
the letter and we notice tears beginning to form in his
eyes. He closes his eyes and blinks them away and then we
see a grin beginning to form on his face, which gives way to
a full fledged laughing fit. He then tucks the letter in his
pocket and takes a seat at the bar next to the Old Man from
the previous scene in which MIKE almost got into a fight
with him. MIKE puts his arm around the guy and gives the
signal for two beers. The camera then goes in reverse,
pulling out on the same route it did as on the way in,
passing all the same people again, the blind date is bored
as Rick is droning on and flexing his bicep, KYLE and his
girlfriend are playing kissey face, MARK is still yelling at
JOSH and shoving a spray paint can in his face and STEVE is
still flirting with the same girl. The door closes and the
scene fades into

INT. - MAGGIE’S CAR - DRIVES AWAY - DUSK

MAGGIE driving with her car full of boxes. She has been
crying recently and/or still is. The camera moves to look at
her hands and she is holding/rubbing the watch MIKE has been
wearing the whole time. She looks at it and wipes her eyes,

she kisses it and a small smile creeps into her face. The
scene fades to black.
