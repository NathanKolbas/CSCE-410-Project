EXT. PORTLAND, OREGON (ESTABLISHING) - DAY
Portland, home of rivers, bridges, and more parks than you 
      can shake a stick at. The Columbia River, spanned by the Highway 5 and 205 
      bridges, glistens a muddy brown in the sunlight; the Willamette glitters 
      off to the South.
INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAY
EMILY ROSE T. HOPE cut her teeth on a million dollar teething 
      ring, and it was bitter -- too bitter. It left her an old woman's attitude 
      in a young woman's body. 
She idly taps a cellular phone's keypad with one perfectly 
      manicured nail as she stares through the parking level's open struts at 
      a distant bridge -- and an approaching river barge. 
The barge draws closer to the bridge. Closer. Closer still. 
      She takes a drag off a cigarette, stubs it out, and dials a number on the 
      phone's keypad.
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
AMADEUS T. HOPE, an older man who most assuredly broke his 
      teeth on a Rolls Royce, stands in a phone booth just off the bridge, waiting 
      for the phone to ring and caressing a briefcase like it contained a million 
      dollars -- which it does. Nearby, idle joggers in the park are more than 
      obviously undercover cops. The phone rings and Amadeus lifts it.






AMADEUS


I'm here.


EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)


Amadeus T. Hope?


AMADEUS


Yes.


EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)


Did you bring the money.


AMADEUS


Yes.


EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)


Listen carefully.


AMADEUS


I wish to speak to my daughter.


EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)


I'm not interested in what you wish, Mr. Hope. Just 
              follow directions and stick to the plan. Am I clear?


AMADEUS


Very.




INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAY
Emily watches the barge move towards the bridge and readjusts 
      her speaking apparatus -- it's a voice filter and it's a real bitch talking 
      through this rig.






EMILY


Do you see the barge approaching the bridge?




INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
Amadeus squints through glass booth walls, notes the approaching 
      barge, nods.






AMADEUS


I see it.


EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)


Walk to the bridge, throw the briefcase onto the 
              barge, and come back to the phone booth for further directions.


AMADEUS


How do I know you'll release her?


EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)


You don't.




INT. DETECTIVE VAN - DAY
DETECTIVE DAN SIMS is the kind of guy who does his job well, 
      but everything always goes to hell anyway. This gives him a grim take on 
      life, but he keeps trying. He watches a fellow COP fiddle with telephone 
      tracing equipment. Sims' less than garrulous partner, BARNABY, listens in 
      on an extra set of headphones.






COP


Shit. Cellular phone. 


SIMS


What did you expect? A silver platter? 


COP


Would'a been nice.




Sims stares out the van's polarized window at Amadeus, who's 
      walking steadily out along the bridge.






SIMS


It's probably hers -- where's he going?


BARNABY


To throw the money over the side.


SIMS


What?


BARNABY


That's what they just told him to do.




Sims, glaring, grabs for a walkie talkie.






SIMS


Were you going to tell me before or after he tossed 
              it?




Barnaby shrugs.






SIMS (CONT'D)


(into walkie talkie)
He's throwing the money onto the barge. I want full 
              surveillance -- don't lose that barge --




INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAY
Emily's got the phone balanced precariously on one shoulder 
      as she flips open the trunk of a gray Mercedes Benz and extracts some heavy 
      duty tape. She stands again to stare out at the distant bridge. 
Amadeus, stick figure tiny with distance, heaves his briefcase 
      over the side and starts back to his phone booth at a steady pace.






EMILY


Nice throw, Dad.




Joggers (i.e. under cover cops), looking like ants from 
      here, scramble to keep pace with the barge. Emily laughs softly as she tapes 
      her ankles together.
The phone crackles to life.






AMADEUS (V.O.)


You've got the money. Where's my daughter?
 




Ankles taped, Emily hops to the edge of the trunk to rummage 
      for more bondage paraphernalia and holds the voice filter carefully in place 
      while she speaks:






EMILY


You'll find her in the trunk of her car, which is 
              in fifth level parking at --




She pulls a wrinkled slip of paper from her jeans pocket 
      and squints at it --






EMILY (CONT'D)


352 East Tenth Street.




She hangs up and, working fast now, because time is running 
      out, gags herself -- a real gag: stuffing, knots, the works. 
Lifting hand cuffs -- the final touch -- she crawls into 
      the car's trunk and, still clutching the handcuffs -- presumably for later 
      use -- slams the lid closed from the inside. 
The ECHO of the slamming trunk reverberates through the 
      dim garage, and dies.
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
Judging from the number of plain cars screaming out of parking 
      spaces, it's a good bet they got that address.
INT. DETECTIVE VAN - DAY
Sims comes out of the van at a dead run, talking into a 
      walkie talkie, as undercover cars peel out, SIRENS wailing on as they go.






SIMS


Odds are someone's still inside monitoring -- 




He glances at the distant parking structure.






SIMS (CONT'D)


They can still see us from there, turn off the god 
              damn sirens!




INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAY
The Mercedes sits innocently in its parking slot. Silence 
      -- except for the slap slap slap of approaching footsteps, and a light, 
      airy tune being whistled by the person approaching.
WILL POGUE ambles nonchalantly between cars, well dressed 
      yuppie at large, just picking up his car and heading home -- or that's what 
      you'd think, until he saunters to the Mercedes, casually glances both ways, 
      and a slim jim flashes in the gloom. 
He's inside the car, yanking the ignition and starting the 
      motor, between whistles.
EXT. RIVER BARGE - DAY
B.g., a helicopter drones. The barge MATE steps out of the 
      wheelhouse, notices the briefcase on the aft deck, frowns, walks to it, 
      picks it up, shakes it, opens it -- and ogles a million bucks, cash.






MATE


Holy shit! 




He spins back to the wheelhouse -- a plea for help.
 






MATE (CONT'D)


Larry! Larry! You gotta come see this!




The PILOT (let's take a wild guess and assume this is Larry) 
      sticks his head out the wheelhouse cabin's door -- just as a helicopter 
      zooms down and a SHARP SHOOTER aims a high powered rifle straight at the 
      mate. A HELICOPTER COP leans out with a megaphone.






HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED)


This is the Portland Police Department. You with 
              the briefcase, set it down and put your hands on your head.


MATE


What the -- ?


HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED)


You in the cockpit, pull over immediately.




The mate drops the briefcase and money starts fluttering 
      all the hell over.
INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - DAY
The sharp shooter smirks at the helicopter cop in a superior 
      way --






SHARP SHOOTER


It's not a car, John, it's a boat. You don't pull 
              over -- 




-- when he sees the money take wind --






SHARP SHOOTER (CONT'D)


-- Oh shit, the money!




The helicopter cop pales -- still yelling through the megaphone 
      --






HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED)


-- Oh fuck, the money. You! Pick the briefcase back 
              up!




Below, the mate wants nothing more to do with that briefcase 
      and has gotten down on his knees to say a few Hail Marys.






HELICOPTER COP (CONT'D) (MEGAPHONED)


You with your hands over your head, pick that briefcase 
              up immediately!




EXT. RIVER BARGE - DAY
The pilot abandons the wheelhouse to try to stop the money's 
      pell mell trail into the sky -- 
He stops dead when the sharp shooter brings the rifle to 
      bear on him -- going after the money is threatening behavior --
The helicopter cop is still yelling through his megaphone 
      --






HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED)


Pick up that briefcase! You moron! Pick it up!




The mate is staring up at the helicopter, eyes big, shaking 
      his head back and forth -- no way is he touching that brief case --
The barge, minus its pilot, hits bottom, the jolt spinning 
      the briefcase out along the deck --
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
Dan Sims wrestles his seat belt, struggling to snap it into 
      a mechanism that just doesn't want to work, riding shot gun as the undercover 
      car careens around the corner and down the street toward the parking structure 
      -- 
EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
The gray Mercedes slips out the structure's exit -- as miscellaneous 
      undercover cars careen past it on their way in -- and turns down the street 
      towards Sims' car. 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
Dan, cursing his seat belt, glances up in time to see the 
      Mercedes pass, does a double take and turns to read the license plate --






SIMS


Holy shit, that's her car!




Barnaby, at the wheel, speeds along in the opposite direction.






BARNABY


What?




Sims, still clutching his seat belt, grabs for the siren 
      as they hit a bump, drops the siren, grabs it again.






BARNABY (CONT'D)


I thought you said no sirens.


SIMS


Turn around! That's her god damned car! 




INT. MERCEDES - DAY
Will, whistling casually, hears tires squeal behind him 
      and checks the rear view mirror -- in time to see Sims slap the SIREN atop 
      the undercover car.






WILL


Holy shit!




Will steps on it, sliding between two more unmarked cars 
      that screech around corners to cut him off -- he cranks the wheel and avoids 
      a third -- 
Will drives better than well -- but he's sweating, cursing 
      under his breath, fighting to outdistance cop cars converging behind him, 
      to dodge incoming cars that keep adding up --






WILL (CONT'D)


Jesus Christ, all this for a lousy grand theft auto?




EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY
Life is not looking good here. Money scattered all over 
      the ground, all over the water, the barge pilot and mate shaking in their 
      shoes, the barge grounded in mud at an awkward angle -- and glum undercover 
      cops milling to and fro. The helicopter cop talks into a radio mike.






HELICOPTER COP


Dan, we lost the money.




INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
Dan Sims, rocking around each curve, hangs onto his swinging 
      seat belt for dear life and yells into his radio.






SIMS


What do you mean, you lost the money? It's on a 
              barge! How hard could it be to keep track of a barge?


HELICOPTER COP (V.O.)


We didn't lose the barge. We lost the money.


SIMS


For Christ's sake, where'd it go?




INT. RIVER BANK - DAY
The helicopter cop stares glumly up at all those fluttering 
      bills in the sky. . . down at all those floating bills on the water. . . 
      .






HELICOPTER COP


Half is air borne, and the other half sank.




INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
Dan's about three shades of purple, still clinging to his 
      dysfunctional seat belt, yelling into the radio --






SIMS


Well fish it out! --




When the car slows. Dan rounds on Barnaby, the driver.






SIMS (CONT'D)


What are you slowing down for!


BARNABY


We lost him.




Sims looks up from the radio at the abandoned street.






SIMS


God damn it, where are the helicopters.


BARNABY


They lost him too.




Sims slumps.






SIMS


I don't believe this.




Barnaby shrugs.






BARNABY


He can't have gone far. They'll pick him up.




INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - DAY
The warehouse is large, immaculate, and dark -- ground level 
      windows are painted black and barred. Shelves hold engine parts. An old 
      beat up Porsche Speedster sits in a corner. Loft steps lead to living quarters 
      above. 
An electric garage door slides open, triggering a ceiling 
      light, and Emily's Mercedes glides in. The garage door shuts behind it and 
      Will climbs from the car to run a shaky hand through his hair. 
B.g., a helicopter DRONES. He lets out an explosion of breath, 
      frowning at the ceiling, WILLing the copter away.






WILL


Jesus.




He pats the car.






WILL (CONT'D)


Who'd you belong to, sweetheart? The president or 
              what?




He checks the car, inside and out, admiring the interior, 
      checking underneath the chassis.






WILL (CONT'D)


Last job, and I nab the president's car. It figures.




He pops the trunk -- there's Emily, bound and gagged, looking 
      the worse for the ride, glaring up at him -- it might have been a mistake, 
      her cuffing her arms behind her back.
 






WILL


Jesus Christ!




He slams the trunk. 
Muffled POUNDING inside. He opens the trunk cautiously, 
      to stare incredulously at Emily.






WILL (CONT'D)


Who the hell are you?


EMILY (MUFFLED)


Mmmmphmmmphmmmphmmmph!


WILL


I don't need this.




He lowers the trunk lid and scrubs his face with a weary 
      hand.






EMILY (MUFFLED) (O.S.)


MmmmMmmmph-ph-ph!




He raises the trunk lid.






WILL


Can you breathe?


EMILY (MUFFLED)


MMmmmmmmMMMphmmmmm!




He nods.






WILL


Have you had water within the last twenty-four hours?


EMILY


MphMphMph!


WILL


You look healthy to me.




He slams the lid, jumps into the driver's seat, and hits 
      the control for the garage door.
WILL
Sweating, revving the engine, waiting for clearance under 
      the door --






WILL


It's okay. She doesn't know your name. She doesn't 
              know the address. Nobody saw you come in. We're just going to leave 
              the car somewhere for the cops to find. No. She could die by then. 
              Okay, we'll call the cops -- an anonymous tip. No problem. Find 
              a corner. Dump the car. Stay calm. Everything is all right --




As the garage door opens, the helicopter DRONE fills the 
      warehouse.
Will sits, listening to that drone in the sky, tapping the 
      steering wheel -- he turns off the engine and listens a second longer, before 
      closing the garage door against that sound. 






WILL


Shit.




INT. AMADEUS's STUDY - EVENING
An ad for the house would boast five fireplaces, parking 
      for nine cars, two hundred feet of river frontage, a dock. . . we are talking 
      exceptionally expensive -- and frighteningly neat. 
THOMAS PERKINS steps into the study: Thomas has scars to 
      prove he's been bad places and lived to not talk about them, which 
      conflicts with his million dollar suit only insofar as he wears it well. 
      
Amadeus, intently manicuring what looks like a perfectly 
      manicured Bonsai, nods.






AMADEUS


Someone's kidnapped Emily.




Perkins snorts. Amadeus pinches off a microscopic section 
      of tree, discarding it in an empty waste basket.






AMADEUS


The police --




(Amadeus uses the word "police" much the 
      way a bull dyke says "penis")






PERKINS


You called the police. 


AMADEUS


No. They called the police.


PERKINS


They. 


AMADEUS


Yes.


PERKINS


Well she's got your attention now, hasn't she?




Amadeus shoots him a dour glance.






AMADEUS


I fail to see the humor in the situation, Thomas. 
              There's a precedent at stake here.




Thomas snorts again -- no way is he believing this.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


The police informed me a man drove her car away 
              from the pick-up zone.




Thomas frowns -- less sure of himself.






PERKINS


An accomplice? That doesn't sound like Emily.




A peremptory KNOCK and Dan Sims pushes into the study. Thomas 
      turns, giving Sims a view of the back of his head and not much else. 






SIMS


Mr. Hope, I'd love to answer phones in your foyer 
              all day, but this man --




Sims glowers at Thomas's back.






SIMS (CONT'D)


-- is not on my roster of household staff -- or 
              guests.


AMADEUS


Mr. Perkins is a private associate, Detective Sims. 
              He'll be taking over.


SIMS


Excuse me?


AMADEUS


Your services are no longer necessary, Detective 
              Sims. If you WILL excuse us?




Amadeus drops another nothing into the waste basket -- a 
      move not lost on Sims.






SIMS


We are not a cleaning service, Mr. Hope. We are 
              the police.




Amadeus stares blankly, like "what's the difference?" 






PERKINS


I think what Detective Sims is trying to say, Amadeus, 
              is you can't fire the police.


SIMS


Exactly.


AMADEUS


(to Perkins)
Are you sure about this?




Perkins nods solemnly.






AMADEUS (CONT'D) 


Very well, Detective Sims may maintain surveillance.




Sims chokes.






SIMS


I. May.


AMADEUS 
(to Sims)


That will be all, Detective Sims.




Sims stands his ground, mutely refusing dismissal.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


Unless you'd like to discuss the money.


SIMS


I'll be in the foyer.




Sims spins for the door -- the door handle fights him.






AMADEUS 


Turn to the right, Detective Sims.




Sims, crimson, turns to the right.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


And Detective Sims? If you're going to remain a 
              fixture in this household, speak to my assistant -- he'll cut you 
              a wardrobe check.




The door slams behind Sims.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


Nobody holds me hostage.




Perkins stares into a glass case -- one of those pedestal 
      jobs you find museum displays in, but this holds photographs:
Emily at three; Emily at the military academy; Emily at 
      graduation; Emily at a high powered reception beside her father -- Thomas 
      Perkins loves that little girl.






PERKINS


We'll make that clear.




INT. AMADEUS'S ANTEROOM/OFF THE STUDY - EVENING
Wires run from phones to phones to black boxes -- presumably 
      the latest in police tech surveillance -- monitored by bleary eyed COPS. 
      
Amadeus's ASSISTANT attempts to work around the squad room 
      squalor. 
Barnaby, being a calm soul, doesn't jump when Sims slams 
      in.






SIMS


Mr. Hope just fired us.




Shocked silence from the cops -- sounds perfectly reasonable 
      to Hope's assistant, though.






HOPE'S ASSISTANT


You'll be leaving, then.




Dan stares at the assistant, incredulous.






SIMS


No we won't be leaving!

INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENING
The Porsche is gone. The Mercedes sits in the gloom.
INT. MERCEDES/TRUNK - EVENING
Emily is in a minor fix -- and judging from the sweat and 
      discontent factor, has been for some time. It's not easy to pass arms, handcuffed 
      behind you, under your legs to in front of you -- especially when you're 
      lying on your side in a trunk -- and Emily's stuck mid-way. 
She struggles again to get her hands past her feet. Struggles 
      some more. They come free.
Next job is to wrench the gag away -- she tied a good gag, 
      so it's tough going, but she gets it off. She yanks stuffing from her mouth, 
      takes a big breath -- spits, tries to wet her mouth.






EMILY


Thank God.




Smiling grimly at success, she extracts the handcuff key 
      from her front jeans pocket and releases the cuffs.
 






EMILY (CONT'D)


Can you breathe. What an asshole.




EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
Will's old Porsche glides down a dimly illuminated street.
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE (WAREHOUSE DISTRICT) - NIGHT
Will's checking the neighborhood for signs of stress, and 
      what he sees isn't good. On the corner, a cruiser.






WILL


Cop.




Across the street, another cruiser.






WILL (CONT'D)


Cop.




Overhead, a helicopter. 






WILL (CONT'D)


Cop. 




On the sidewalk, a German Shepherd -- 






WILL (CONT'D)


Cop -- dog?




He shakes his head.






WILL (CONT'D)


Don't be paranoid. That is not a cop dog.




He cranes his neck to stare up through the windshield.






WILL (CONT'D)


But that is definitely a cop helicopter.




He eyes the passing cruiser.






WILL (CONT'D)


And that is definitely a cop car.




Another cruiser sits quietly on the corner, lights out, 
      but there's a guy in uniform in the car all right.






WILL (CONT'D)


Cop cop cop.




Will jerks the steering wheel hard, swerving down a dark 
      street and away --
INT. MERCEDES/TRUNK - EVENING
Emily searches around the trunk lid's key slot -- frustrated, 
      not finding what she wants, then finding it -- a small hole in the metal 
      -- 
There's a piece of metal blocking the mechanism that would 
      usually allow someone to open the trunk from the inside.






EMILY


Why does it always have to be the hard way?




She squirms around to face the back of the trunk --
								DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. MILITARY SCHOOL - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Impeccable grounds, impeccable buildings -- except for one, 
      the corner of which has been reduced to rubble by an explosion, if the burn 
      marks are any indication. 
Thomas Perkins, hands clasped behind his back, rolls forward 
      and backward on the balls of his feet, studying the rubble.
Emily (young) stands beside him, dressed "academy," suitcase 
      by her feet, and grins, proud. 






PERKINS


You're lucky no one was in there.




Emily's offended.






YOUNG EMILY


That wasn't luck. I called.


PERKINS


Voice I.D.




Emily grimaces chagrin.






YOUNG EMILY


That won't happen again.




Thomas lifts her suitcase and strides across impeccable 
      lawn, towards a faraway and expensive automobile with tinted windows.






PERKINS


You won't call? Awful messy, when bodies blow.




She stumps along at his side.






YOUNG EMILY


I won't use a cold phone.


PERKINS


Emily, if we could keep you in school long enough 
              to get an education, you'd have a real future in Secret Service.




They're at the car. He opens the passenger door for her. 
      She pulls out a cigarette and lights up.






YOUNG EMILY


I don't need a future. I'm rich.




Thomas plucks the cigarette from her mouth, grinds it under 
      his heel, and extends his open palm, waiting.
She glares, sighs, and hands over the pack.
INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT'D)
Thomas drives. Young Emily broods in injured silence.






YOUNG EMILY


He could have come. Probably playing with those 
              damn trees.


PERKINS


Maybe he doesn't appreciate paying for a new wing.




Injured silence.






PERKINS (CONT'D)


You know what this means.


YOUNG EMILY


Uh oh.


PERKINS


Back to Catholic school.


YOUNG EMILY


Nuns? Again?


PERKINS


It's going to take a while for me to get you in 
              anywhere else.


YOUNG EMILY


Nuns are the worst.


PERKINS


Look in the glove box.




Emily brightens and digs, coming up with a gift wrapped 
      box.






PERKINS (CONT'D)


Happy Birthday, Emily.




Emily shoots him a grateful smile, reads the card, grimaces.






YOUNG EMILY


Thank you, Uncle Thomas.


PERKINS


It's from your father.


YOUNG EMILY


It's a nice lie. Thanks for remembering.




She tears wrapping.






PERKINS


You're locked in a room. What do you do?


YOUNG EMILY


Check windows.


PERKINS


The windows are barred.


YOUNG EMILY


Check doors.


PERKINS


The doors are locked.


YOUNG EMILY


Check the ceiling.




This is a very old routine, almost sing song.






PERKINS


Ceiling's clean.




Emily lifts a delicate necklace from the wrapping.






YOUNG EMILY


This is beautiful, Uncle Thomas. 




She leans over, kisses his cheek.






YOUNG EMILY (CONT'D) 


Thank you.


PERKINS


Ceiling.


YOUNG EMILY


I don't want to play today.




Silence.






YOUNG EMILY (CONT'D)


Why don't you take me out to dinner, Uncle Thomas?




Silence.






YOUNG EMILY (CONT'D)


It's my birthday.




More silence. Emily sighs.






YOUNG EMILY (CONT'D)


I hate rooms. Let's do explosives. 




He cocks an eyebrow at her -- explosives are not a good 
      subject right now.






PERKINS


We're doing rooms.


YOUNG EMILY


Okay, rooms, but you have to buy me a real 
              drink.




He snorts laughter.
							DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENING
The Mercedes' back seat pops loose and Emily, scuffed, crawls 
      from the trunk, over the back seat, into the car's interior. 






EMILY


You owe me a drink, Thomas.




The first thing she reaches for is the Mercedes' cellular 
      phone. The cord is cut.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Oh, you creep.




She pulls her purse from the trunk, rearranges the back 
      seat, and considers a cigarette -- sniffs the air, wrinkles her nose, shakes 
      her head sorrowfully, and puts the cigarette away -- before climbing out 
      of the car to survey her surroundings. No phones.
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Will steers down a dark street he knows by heart -- takes 
      an alley by rote, a short cut, passes a sign: "Portland International Airport" 
      --
EXT. PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT
The Porsche idles, headlights illuminating Will as he shoves 
      aside a fence marked "Airport Personnel Only" --
He pulls the car into an abandoned lot off the runway, settles 
      onto the car's hood with a weary sigh, stress falling away as he stares 
      up at planes taking off for Somewhere Else. 
And watching his face, you know he wants to be going to 
      Somewhere Else -- has wanted that for all his life -- 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENING
Whoever designed this place was more than security conscious. 
      Bars and locks on what few windows there are, each requiring a key. Emily 
      strokes the bars in disgust, shoves a finger through to scratch a thin line 
      in the black paint covering the glass surface.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Shit.




There're a couple of doors on the ground floor. First one's 
      a bathroom. She checks it out. Nothing in there but toilet paper, toilet, 
      sink, and soap. 
The second door is locked.
She pads upstairs to study the door to the living quarters 
      -- also locked. Not with a household doorknob. With a key lock.






EMILY (CONT'D)


What a control freak.




She turns to study the garage door. No buttons for getting 
      this baby open -- ceiling and door mechanisms out of reach. Everything locked 
      down, barred, keyed, bolted.
She pads to a tool bench and rummages in its drawers -- 
      the only things not locked down. 
EXT. PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT
Will's still watching those planes -- but he's calmer, more 
      together, and it's time to shake it off. 
Moving stiffly, he climbs off the hood, walks around to 
      climb into the porsche's driver's seat.
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE (PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT) - NIGHT
Starting the engine, shooting one more "Wait for me, I'm 
      coming back" grimace at those rumbling planes.






WILL


Another day. Another life.




He pulls out and away.
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Emily, surrounded by tools, works to disassemble the lock 
      on the living quarters door -- this is one killer lock. 
The tool slips, stabs into her finger -- adding to a growing 
      assortment of insults to what used to be a perfect manicure -- she pops 
      the injured digit into her mouth, studies the nicks, cuts, and abrasions 
      with contempt. 
A police SIREN flares outside. 
She brightens, till the siren FADES into the distance.






EMILY


To protect and serve. Yeah, right.




She rises stiffly, shoves sweaty hair off her forehead, 
      glares angrily at the lock -- which looks intact as hell -- stretches, sighs, 
      and pads to the bathroom.
EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
The Porsche glides to the warehouse's garage door.
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Will triggers the garage door with the opener that never 
      leaves his side -- preferably, as high tech a coded mechanism as God put 
      on this green earth, when it comes to garage door openers. The door slides 
      open.
INT./EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/BATHROOM/MAIN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Emily's on the toilet when the electric garage door HUMS, 
      b.g.






EMILY


No!




It's hard to hurry these things up, but she's ready to pee 
      her jeans to get out of there -- she reaches automatically to flush the 
      toilet, jerks her hand back.






EMILY (CONT'D)


What, am I nuts?




Struggling to get her pants put to rights as she stumbles 
      to the door --
MAIN WAREHOUSE
Will guides the Porsche into the slot beside the Mercedes, 
      swings out of the Porsche, approaching the Mercedes, as the garage door 
      starts down, pauses -- 
He doesn't want to open that damn trunk. He eyes it, apprehensive 
      -- 






WILL


This is ridiculous.




He pops the trunk.
It's empty.






WILL (CONT'D)


Oh shit.




He stares around the warehouse -- nothing -- spins to eye 
      the closing garage door in horror.






WILL (CONT'D)


No!




He smacks the control, halting the door in mid-close, ducks 
      under it to stare up and down the street of a run down warehouse district.
Emily slips from the bathroom, working her way stealthily 
      along the wall towards the open door.






WILL (CONT'D)


God damn it!




An OLD WOMAN stops picking through a dumpster to glare defiantly 
      at him. He rakes a hand through his hair --
Emily's almost to the open door --
Will turns, ducking back inside -- looking both ways --
Emily, busted, lunges for the opening --
He lunges to cut her off -- 
It's a flying, freewheeling tackle -- they hit the concrete 
      floor -- inside -- and hard. 
POV 
Outside the door, the old woman gawks.
WILL and emily
Will's fighting to hold Emily down as he clicks the garage 
      door opener -- the door starts going up -- 






WILL


Damn it!




Clicking again -- going down --
Fighting -- it's not a sure thing who's winning here -- 
      she kicks the door's bottom edge -- going up --
He's cursing, hitting buttons -- going down --
She's kicking -- there's a lot of defense training in those 
      kicks -- which is unfortunate for Will's jaw -- going for the door again 
      with that foot --
He heaves, dragging them both backwards across concrete, 
      out of reach -- and the door slams closed.
Silence.
Will rolls onto his toes, breathing heavy, waiting for the 
      next attack.
Emily stares at the closed door in disgust, rubs her concrete 
      burned elbow.






WILL


If you were smart, you would have pulled that stunt 
              when I pulled in.


EMILY


I am smart. I had to pee.




Not what he was expecting -- and he almost laughs, stops 
      when he touches his injured chin. 
Wincing -- that elbow hurts -- she studies him. 






EMILY (CONT'D)


This place is harder to get out of than a convent.


WILL


How'd you get out of the trunk?




She surveys the Mercedes, the warehouse, him.






EMILY


You're not a kidnapper. You're a thief.




Will snorts.






WILL


And the handcuffs.


EMILY


Hah. You were after the car.


WILL


Lady, you're giving me a headache. Who are you?




She smiles, all winsome charm.






EMILY


Tell you what. Give me the car keys, let me out 
              of here, and this'll be our little secret? Deal?




INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)
Emily sits on the commode, handcuffed again, this time to 
      the sink. She's wearing pants this time, too, but that doesn't appear to 
      cheer her up. 
Will, flaunting a new and improved jaw injury, smiles grimly 
      and pockets the handcuff key.






EMILY


You scum sucking, arrogant, peg-headed, sadistic 
              --




Will touches his jaw gingerly.






WILL


I liked you better in the trunk.


EMILY


I hope you go bald.




A doorbell CHIMES above in the living quarters.






WILL


Oh, hell.




He shuts the bathroom door -- on a few stifled yells -- 
      and punches an intercom button on the wall.






WILL


Yeah?


JOE (V.O.)


Will?


WILL


Joe?


JOE (V.O.)


Yep.




Will winces.






WILL


What are you doing here, Joe?


JOE (V.O.)


Plates ring a bell? Maybe tags? Maybe you were supposed 
              to be at my place five hours ago?


WILL


Oh. Great. 


(he doesn't sound great)


Hang on -- I'll be right up.




EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
The old woman from the dumpster stalks, stiff backed, to 
      a parked police cruiser and raps on the window. A startled PATROLMAN rolls 
      it down. She stares him straight in the eye, daring him to notice her dirt 
      swept hair.






OLD WOMAN


I would like to report a case of domestic violence.


PATROLMAN


You need to call it in. I'm on special assignment.


OLD WOMAN


Excuse me, while I pull out my portable phone.


PATROLMAN


You want a ride downtown, Sister?


OLD WOMAN


There is a man beating his wife down the street.




The patrolman winces. She radiates indignation. He lifts 
      his radio.






PATROLMAN


Central, I've got a report of domestic violence 
              in the neighborhood. Request backup. Over.


VOICE OVER


Negative, 223. All cars in the vicinity on special 
              assignment. I'll have to send someone else out. Over.




The patrolman rolls his eyes at the old woman.






PATROLMAN
(to old woman)


What'd I tell you?




She snorts.

Sit tight, 223. I'll see what I can do.




INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT
(Uncle) JOE POGUE is a pretty good indication of what Will's 
      going to grow up to be, if Will doesn't get on one of those planes pretty 
      quick. Not that Joe's a bad guy -- he isn't -- but he's got a habit, namely 
      a bottle, and a tired stoop to his shoulders that says bad news has perched 
      on his doorstep one too many times.
Will opens the door, ready to say something appropriate, 
      like maybe this is a bad time -- but doesn't get the chance.






JOE


Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Where have you been?




Joe barges right in, waving a crinkled up brown paper shopping 
      bag under Will's nose -- about the size and shape of license plates.






WILL


Oh god, I forgot.


JOE


You forgot? You forgot? I thought you were in jail.




Stalking to the refrigerator.






JOE (CONT'D)


He forgot. You got anything to drink around here?




The question's moot, as Joe's got his beer and is headed 
      for the door to downstairs.






JOE (CONT'D)


Did you get her?




Will panics for a quick second.






WILL


Her?


JOE


The car? 


WILL


Oh, right, the car. Yeah, I got her.




Joe, much to Will's chagrin, is headed straight for the 
      door to downstairs.






JOE


Well let's take a look.




Joe stops at the door, studying the knob, which is loose.






JOE (CONT'D)


When are you going to quit this business, Will? 
              




Will, at a loss, shrugs. Joe snorts and studies the warehouse 
      side of the doorknob and lock. Scratched.






JOE (CONT'D)


Yeah, that's what I thought. Last job, my ass.




Joe stomps down the steps.






JOE (CONT'D)


He forgot.




INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Joe, stroking the Mercedes, whistles. Will attempts to arrange 
      his hands in some sort of natural pose and look nonchalant.






JOE


She's pretty.


WILL


I don't think I can unload her.




Joe's head snaps up. 






JOE


Why? What's wrong with her?


WILL


Long story.


JOE


Then it'll have to wait --




Joe smacks the bag and beer into Will's numb hands.






JOE (CONT'D)


There're your papers, tags, and plates -- whether 
              or not you can unload her -- and there's my beer. I gotta talk to 
              a man about a horse.




Joe's on his way, steamrolling right up to that bathroom 
      door.






WILL


Uncle Joe?




Joe's hand's on the doorknob, turning --






JOE


Yeah?




The door's opening -- 






WILL


Nothing.




Emily, sitting on the commode, shoots Joe one wide, fake, 
      frosty smile, and waves at him with her free hand.






JOE 


Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!




Joe simultaneously leaps up, backward, and slams the door. 
      He stands, hand on knob, thinking for a moment, before turning heavily to 
      the stairs and starting back up for the living quarters.
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT
Joe's sitting at the table, stone cold still. Will's filling 
      a coffee pot with water, just as quiet.






JOE


Get me another beer, Son.




Will gets the beer, pops it open, sets it down beside Joe's 
      empty. Joe drains it, then sets the can carefully down on the table.






JOE (CONT'D)


Pardon me for intruding in your affairs, Will, but 
              there is a girl downstairs chained to the commode.




Will nods, pouring water into the coffee maker.






JOE (CONT'D)


Of course, it's nice to see you with a girl, Will. 
              I've been kinda worried about you in the girl department of late. 
              




Will ogles Joe, mouths "In the girl department?" -- coffee 
      splatters from the coffee machine -- Will jams the pot in place to catch 
      the stream.






JOE (CONT'D) 


But it was somewhat of a surprise.


WILL


I can see that.


JOE


I think I'll be heading home now, Will.




Joe stands and heads creakily for the door.






WILL


Uncle Joe, would you like to know why I have a girl 
              chained up downstairs?




Joe thinks a moment, slowly shakes his head.






JOE


Nope. Nope. Don't want to know nothing about it.




He's at the front door, opening it, turning.






JOE (CONT'D)


But Will?


WILL


Yes?


JOE


Flowers are a good alternative.




Joe closes the door behind him. Will sits at the table, 
      trying to take it all in. The door opens again and Joe sticks his head in.






JOE (CONT'D)


Oh, and Will?


WILL


Yes?


JOE


She's a real pretty girl, Will. Your parents would've 
              been proud to know you're seeing such a real pretty girl.




And then he's gone. Will rises slowly and starts closing 
      down locks -- all keyed from the inside. There's a window running alongside 
      the door -- barred, natch, but you can see through the upstairs windows, 
      'cause they aren't painted black.
INT. POLICE CAR (BEHIND WILL'S WAREHOUSE) - NIGHT
The patrolman eyes back entrances to warehouse buildings. 
      They all look pretty much the same in the gloom. The old woman leans forward 
      and points.






OLD WOMAN


That's the one.


PATROLMAN


You sure?




She nods.






OLD WOMAN


Across from the dumpster.


PATROLMAN 


Okay.




Through the patrol car's back window, you can see a second 
      patrol car following them as he glides down the back street and turns the 
      corner.
EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/FRONT - NIGHT 
Joe's climbing into his old Chevy -- a small, slumped figure 
      in all that darkness -- when the two police cars cruise around the corner 
      and down the street towards the warehouse's front entrance.






WILL (O.S.)


Oh, shit. 




The police cars are slowing, checking buildings --






WILL (O.S.) (CONT'D)


Go, Uncle Joe, Go.




INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT
Will's at the window, every tendon in his body pushing for 
      Joe to get out of there --






WILL


Don't stop, old man.




EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/FRONT - NIGHT
Joe's leaning forward in his car, eyeing the approaching 
      cruisers in his rearview mirror -- casually, oh so casually, adjusting that 
      mirror -- you can see the indecision in him, sitting there, adjusting the 
      mirror just a little too long --
But he starts his old car up and pulls away from the curb, 
      gliding slowly down the block --
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT
Will, standing pensive by the window, watching --






WILL


Keep going, Joe, keep going --




EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/FRONT - NIGHT
Joe's Chevy glides around the corner as the two cruisers 
      halt in front. Their doors creak open, and the patrolman and a COMPANION 
      COP climb out.
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT
Will drags a pre-packed duffel bag from under the bed, checks 
      to make sure a stack (we are talking a serious STACK) of money is in there, 
      and hoists the duffel, heading for the stairs. 
A KNOCK sounds behind him. 
Another KNOCK. 
He sets the bag softly down and eyes the door. 






WILL


Okay, they're serious. But how serious?




EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/FRONT - NIGHT
The patrolman knocks on the door again, looks at his COMPANION 
      COP, shrugs.






COMPANION COP


Lights are on.




The patrolman nods, starting back for his car.






PATROLMAN


Call it in and see what they say.




He leans into the cruiser, pulls out the radio mike.






PATROLMAN (CONT'D)


Central, I've got a situation here in the warehouse 
              district. Over.




INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT
Will hoists his duffel bag.






WILL


Too damn serious for me.




INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Will, coming down stairs two at a time, tossing the duffel 
      bag into the back of the Porsche, yanking the bathroom door open on Emily 
      --






EMILY


You running a peek show here or what? 


WILL


Up.




He's undoing the handcuff on the sink, jerking her to her 
      feet, dragging her towards the car --






EMILY


Who was that old man?




Shoving her headfirst through the Porsche's passenger door, 
      he slaps the cuff to the passenger brace bar --






EMILY (CONT'D)


Hey! God Damn It!




She jerks backwards -- stuck.






WILL


Get in.




She doesn't.
He's headed around the car, slipping into the driver's seat, 
      revving the engine as he slaps control keys to open the garage door -- he 
      pauses to stare at her, hard and cold.
 






WILL (CONT'D)


You can ride inside or outside the car, but either 
              way, when that door opens, we're leaving.




Emily climbs into the car and slams the door.






EMILY


You're a real fun date, you know that?


WILL


You aren't my idea of a good time.




The Porsche squeals out of the warehouse.
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT
The coffee pot steams on its burner.
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
Joe slows to a crawl, pulls the Chevy over, and sits there 
      idling -- tapping the steering wheel, indecisive.






JOE


Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.




He squints at approaching headlights in the rearview mirror.
The approaching car slows, pulls alongside him. Natch, it's 
      a COP. The cop shines a flashlight in at Joe, rolls down a window, forcing 
      Joe to roll down his window and squint into the glare.






COP


Everything all right here?


JOE


Oh, yeah, just fine. I just kinda lost my way.




The cop's getting out. Joe winces.






COP


Could I see some identification, please?


JOE


Oh, sure.




Joe fumbles for his wallet, pulls out a license, extends 
      it with a shaky hand -- the cop eyes him, takes it, studies it, then Joe.






COP


Mr. Pogue, would you please step out of the car?


JOE


Excuse me?


COP


Please step out of the car, Sir.




Joe opens the door and climbs out.






JOE


Hey, I just got a little lost, is all. If you could 
              give me directions to the freeway --


COP


Have you been drinking tonight, Mr. Pogue?




INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Will winds up Highway 5, North. Emily, still cuffed to the 
      brace bar, broods in the passenger seat.






EMILY


I can see you are a master economist of words.




Will grunts, spots a lone gas station and phone booth on 
      an abandoned stretch, slows to pull off the highway.






EMILY (CONT'D)


You're a kidnapper now, you know. I mean, before, 
              it was just an accident, but this is definitely a hostage situation.




Silence.






EMILY (CONT'D) 


Oh, and in case you didn't notice that sign back 
              there? "Washington." 




Silence. She shakes her head in mock chagrin.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Crossing a state line with a hostage. That's a federal 
              offense.




Will idles in front of the phone booth, unlocks the cuffs, 
      leans across her to push open the passenger door.






WILL


Get out.




Emily eyes him, the phone booth, him.






EMILY


Get. Out?




The car idles. Cold wind sweeps through the open door, ruffling 
      anything not nailed down. 
She sits, not moving. Comprehension dawns on his face.






WILL


Oh. Here.




He fishes in his pocket, pulls out a quarter, smacks it 
      into her palm. 
She studies the quarter in her palm like it's some sort 
      of alien relic -- slowly looks up at him.






EMILY 


Are you mad? 


WILL


Excuse me?


EMILY


You think, after being locked up, starved, bullied! 
              Brow beaten! Robbed! And you forgot my purse. You think now you're 
              going to give me a quarter and leave me here?


WILL


This'll do.


EMILY


Forget it. I want a cigarette. I want breakfast. 
              I want a shower. And I want my car.




She crosses her arms. He struggles for an appropriate response 
      -- 






WILL


I don't allow smoking in my car.


EMILY


Are you for real?




The engine idles.
Will eyes the car's dimensions, gauging the feasibility 
      of a fight in close quarters, touches the bandage on his chin.
She smiles, smug -- his odds don't look good.






WILL


I'm a hardened criminal.


EMILY (CONT'D)


I'm Emily Rose T. Hope. And you do not want to mess 
              with me before I get my morning cigarette.




Emily snaps her seat belt on with finality.
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - NIGHT
Dan Sims wrestles his seat belt as the undercover car screeches 
      through the warehouse district.






SIMS


I thought I told you to get this fixed.




Barnaby shrugs.






BARNABY


I did get it fixed.


SIMS


Then why isn't it fixed?


BARNABY


New car assignment.




Dan, at a loss, studies the car's interior -- it sure as 
      hell looks like the same car, right down to the gum on the dashboard. He 
      sighs.






SIMS


Get it fixed.




Barnaby shrugs.






SIMS (CONT'D)


What the hell is that?




Dan squints through the windshield at a column of black 
      smoke.






BARNABY


Looks like smoke.


SIMS


I am really trying to like you, Barnaby, but you 
              just make it so damn hard.




Barnaby shrugs. The car speeds on --






SIMS (CONT'D)


Oh no. It can't be. . . .




But it is. Will Pogue's warehouse roars away in a fire to 
      beat all fires. Out front, police and firemen jostle shoulder to shoulder 
      with newscasters.
EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Sims climbs from the car to stare in appalled silence at 
      the blaze. Barnaby climbs from the car to stand cheerfully at his side.






BARNABY


Fire started in the kitchen. 


SIMS


You knew about this?


BARNABY


Car's inside, though, so this is definitely the 
              place.


SIMS


How do you know this? 




Barnaby shrugs. 






BARNABY


Daniels called it in. Too bad they couldn't get 
              those locks off, before the building went. Gonna lose a lot of evidence.


SIMS 


Barnaby.


BARNABY


Yes?


SIMS


I'm not sure there's a legal precedent for arresting 
              my partner for withholding evidence, but I am going to check the 
              books.




B.g., Perkins watches the blaze, watches Sims and Barnaby, 
      taking it all in with an impassive expression. A REPORTER slams a microphone 
      into Sims' face.






REPORTER


Detective, is it true this is the suspected lair 
              of kidnappers? 


SIMS


What?


REPORTER


Isn't it true, Detective, that --




INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - DAY (OVERCAST)
Dawn streaks the sky. Will drives down a dirt road, ominously 
      silent. Emily sucks on a cigarette, blows smoke out the open window, studying 
      the deserted surroundings warily.






EMILY


A speech class could do wonders for you. Maybe instill 
              some of that inner confidence needed to carry on a conversation.




He keeps driving -- we're talking past the middle of nowhere, 
      here -- the landscape grows more and more barren.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Want to tell me where we're going?




No response. Emily is winding tighter and tighter. 






EMILY (CONT'D)


Nice place to hide a body.




Not even a peep. 
She stubs out her cigarette, glares at the open window.






EMILY (CONT'D)


How can anyone live without air conditioning?




He turns into an abandoned field.
She rolls up her window, surreptitiously glides her finger 
      across the door lock -- pushes it down.
He stops the car, shuts off the ignition, turns to rummage 
      in the duffel bag. 
She slams him hard with her elbow, hits him again to keep 
      him down, lunges across him to knock his door open --
He's coming up -- she kicks him, sending him backwards out 
      the door -- kicks again, to send him all the way out --
Will hits dirt as she slams the door, locks it, slides into 
      the driver's seat, and reaches for the ignition -- 
No key.
Will, rising stiffly, jingles the car keys outside the window 
      and smiles, grim. 
She punches the ignition switch -- 






WILL


Open the door.




She punches the ignition switch again. It pops free. She 
      reaches for its wires.
Will winces -- he did not want to do this -- doubles up 
      his fist, and punches a hole through the driver's side window. 
Emily lunges backwards, out of reach, into the passenger 
      seat, still holding the limp ignition. 
He unlocks and opens the driver's side door.






WILL


What the hell do you think you're doing?




Emily is breathing hard, tensed to kick him again. 
Seconds tick by. She relaxes -- barely.






EMILY


What are you doing?




Will reaches cautiously into the car to lift a running shoe 
      from the floorboard -- what he dropped when the assault began -- dangles 
      it for her inspection.
Emily, pale, eyes it, him. 
He looks pointedly at the driver's seat, raises a brow in 
      a question. 
She bites her lip, nods, gathering herself into a small 
      ball as he sits gingerly on the glass littered driver's seat and pulls off 
      his shoes.






WILL


It's six o'clock. 




This means nothing to Emily. Lacing up, he shoots her a 
      skeptical glance.






WILL (CONT'D) 


I run at six o'clock. 




She bites her lip harder. Will lifts the limp ignition and 
      studies it, her, pops the hood and climbs out. 






EMILY


Now what are you doing? 




He jerks the distributor cap and pockets it, before limping 
      down the road at a slow lope. 
Emily watches him go in consternation.
EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY
Will, bloody but unbent, doggedly runs, ignoring Emily, 
      who trots by his side, puffing a cigarette.






EMILY


You're angry.




Silence.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Well what did you expect me to think?




Silence.






EMILY (CONT'D)


I'm sorry.




He shoots her an appalled glance.






WILL


For beating the crap out of me, or my car? 




Emily smiles, winsome charm.






EMILY 


How can I make it up to you?


WILL


Go home.


EMILY


I'd love to do that for you, but then I'd have to 
              explain about how you stole my car.


WILL


I'll buy it.


EMILY


Excuse me?


WILL


I'll buy the damn car. 


EMILY


But I love that car.




He seethes.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Fifty thousand dollars.


WILL


What?




A slow drizzle is beginning. Will, breathing hard, stops 
      and braces his hands against his knees. Emily looks him up and down, takes 
      a pull off her cigarette.






EMILY


For a runner, you're not in very good shape.


WILL


Fifty thousand dollars. It's used.


EMILY


Cash.




His jaw tightens.






WILL


Fine.




Will picks up the pace. Emily, fascinated, follows.






EMILY


You've got fifty thousand dollars cash?


WILL


Yes.


EMILY


On you?


WILL


Yes.


EMILY


How barbaric.




EXT. MOTEL - DAY
Will's Porsche sits outside the dingy motel structure.
INT. MOTEL/ROOM - DAY
Emily hums, toweling her hair. Will taps the phone, impatient 
      as hell. Emily grins.






EMILY


You oughta take one. Nice to be human again.


WILL


What's the number?


EMILY


What, no breakfast?




Judging from his expression, it looks like breakfast is 
      out.






WILL


The number.


EMILY


Where's my money?




Will throws a packet of cash on the table.






EMILY


Five-oh-three, five-five-five, eight-nine-seven-six.


WILL


Thank you.




He dials. It RINGS on the other end. Emily lifts cash and 
      counts under her breath.






ASSISTANT (V.O.)


Hope residence.




Will extends the phone to Emily. She shrugs him off, still 
      counting.






ASSISTANT (V.O.) (CONT'D) 


Hope residence. May I help you?


WILL


I'd like to speak to Mr. Hope, please.


ASSISTANT (V.O.)


May I ask what this is regarding?


WILL


His daughter.


ASSISTANT (V.O.)


One moment please.




The line CLICKS a few times.






WILL
(whispering)


You are going to talk to him.


EMILY


Forty seven, forty eight --


AMADEUS (V.O.)


This is Amadeus T. Hope. To whom am I speaking?


WILL


Your daughter would like to speak to you, Mr. Hope.




Will extends the phone to Emily. She takes her time. Will 
      shakes the phone at her. She touches off the last bills.






EMILY


Forty-nine, and fifty.




She smiles sweetly and takes the phone.
 






EMILY 
(into phone)


Daddy?
 


AMADEUS (V.O.)


Emily?


EMILY


Daddy, he made me suck his penis --


WILL


What!?




Will rips the phone away and slams the receiver into its 
      cradle. Emily collapses on the bed, laughing. 






WILL (CONT'D)


What the hell is the matter with you? You think 
              that's funny?




He rips the money from her hands.






WILL (CONT'D)


Give me that! 




She's still laughing. He ogles her, horrified.






WILL (CONT'D)


You look human. . . you sound human. . . but underneath 
              it all --




Emily stops laughing.






EMILY


We'd better leave.


WILL


You leave.


EMILY


They traced that call.




Emily heads for the door. Will's not going anywhere. 






WILL


They didn't have time.




She pauses, exasperated.






EMILY


My father doesn't need time. We've got to go. Now.




He stands firm. She stalks out.






WILL


Shit. This is definitely a hostage situation.




INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - DAY (RAINING)
Will, driving, squints against rain splattering through 
      the hole in the driver's side window. Emily, smoking with her window cracked, 
      is quiet.






WILL


Family reunions must be a blast at your house.




She taps cigarette ash out the window -- wind and rain blow 
      it back into the car. Will winces.






EMILY


I'm just having a little fun here. Don't take it 
              personally.


WILL


This is fun?


EMILY


This car isn't safe anymore.


WILL


You want another car, you steal your own.


EMILY


Excuse me. I have a car. It happens to be in your 
              garage.




They drive in stony silence --






WILL


Lemme let you in on a little secret, Princess. The 
              cars I steal are business. Not fun. Not boredom. Not rich kid curiosity 
              or life on the wild side. Business. 




He's pissed. Emily laughs.
 






EMILY


I like you.


WILL


What do you do to people you don't like?




Will sighs, swerves to the curb, turns to her, engine idling.






WILL (CONT'D)


Look, I don't like being chased by police. I don't 
              like police coming to my door. I don't like strangers in my house. 
              I don't like strangers in my car. I don't like strangers, period.




Emily studies him with a clear steady gaze.






WILL (CONT'D)


So I'm sure you're a real nice girl, though you've 
              got a few problems and a real strange sense of humor, but I didn't 
              ask for you, I don't want you, I don't need you, and I don't like 
              you. I want off this ride.


EMILY


Okay.


WILL


Okay?


EMILY


Okay.


WILL


Good.


EMILY


Pay me for my car, and I'm gone.


WILL


What?




Emily shoots him a look. His jaw tightens.






WILL (CONT'D)


Fine.




EXT. MOTEL - DAY
Thomas Perkins' discreet automobile -- tinted windows, Oregon 
      plates -- sits in the motel parking lot Emily and Will just left -- 
And past the car, through the motel office window, you can 
      see Perkins conversing with a very pale motel office clerk -- who opens 
      a registration book, no questions asked, for Thomas to examine.
EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY (RAINING)
It's not night, but it's damn dark, what with rain and clouds. 
      A gaudy neon light flashes welcome at the interstate. Fluorescents pierce 
      the gloom above gas pumps and semis. Occasional burly figures dash beneath 
      slickers for the yellow glow of a coffee shop.
Will and Emily stand in shadow by the Porsche. Will casts 
      a doubtful glance around -- Emily extends her hand.






EMILY


Well, have a good life.




Will awkwardly accepts the handshake.






WILL


Same to you.


EMILY


And lose that car --




Will opens his mouth to protest --






EMILY (CONT'D)


Just for a while. Park it somewhere. And stay away 
              from phones. Trust me on this.




She strides away, a slim, erect figure in the gloom -- looking, 
      suddenly, awfully frail and abandoned. Will frowns, a hint of concern, then 
      touches his bruised jaw and eyes his broken window.






WILL


Who am I kidding? She can take care of herself.




He shakes his head -- Emily turns --






EMILY


Hey, what's your name?




Will pauses, indecisive --






Emily (CONT'D)


Never mind. Probably better if I don't know.


WILL


Right.


EMILY 


Right.




He watches, until she disappears around a corner --
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - DAY (RAINING)
Will collapses into the Porsche's rain soaked seat, grimaces 
      at the wet and the hanging ignition, then starts the car and pulls onto 
      the highway. But he checks the rearview mirror one last time, watching the 
      truck stop lights fade away into the gloom.






WILL


Good-bye, Emily Hope.




And he breathes a sigh of relief.
EXT. FARMHOUSE/DRIVE - DAY (RAINING)
Dusk is falling as Will's Porsche turns up a dirt drive 
      and halts at an old gate -- 
Will climbs out to unlock a rusty key lock on an old chain, 
      swings the gate open, drives through, climbs out to relock it, before continuing 
      up the drive.
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - DAY (RAINING)
Will follows the drive through trees, an overgrown field, 
      around a bend -- there's an old dilapidated farmhouse and a boarded up barn 
      ahead.
He stops at the barn and clicks his trusty garage door opener 
      -- the barn door rolls back on tracks.
INT. BARN - DAY (RAINING)
Inside, the barn's similar to Will's Portland warehouse: 
      illuminated by overhead flourescents, a clean, if dusty, cement floor, a 
      couple cars under dusty covers. 
Will climbs wearily from the Porsche, pats its side affectionately, 
      and heads out the side door --
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (RAINING)
-- making his way to the old farmhouse --
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
A big old place, dusty and unused. But the utilities work 
      -- Will swings into the kitchen, flicks on lights, dials a phone -- pauses, 
      shakes his head --






WILL


Don't be ridiculous.




And continues dialing. He drags a coffee maker from under 
      the counter, rinses as he listens to the phone RING on the other end.






JOE (V.O.)


This is Joe. I'm not here. Leave a message.




Will sighs.
INT. TRUCK STOP/COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
Emily, rain soaked and looking less than able to pay for 
      a cup of coffee, sits at the counter wearing a pair of large, black sunglasses, 
      sipping the aforementioned coffee and studying a map.
The WAITRESS shoots her a suspicious glance, ambles up to 
      refill her cup and smack a bill on the counter.






WAITRESS


Lotta glare on the road today, is there?




She indicates the rain swept night outside the windows. 
      Emily touches her sunglasses and laughs, self conscious.






EMILY


Oh, these.




The waitress waits for Emily to take off the sunglasses. 
      Emily doesn't.






EMILY (CONT'D)


This is very embarrassing --




Emily touches a finger to the skin beneath her sunglasses 
      -- implying a black eye -- shrugs, lifts her coffee cup, bringing her scabbed 
      over elbow into full view -- 
In two seconds flat, the waitress goes from smart ass to 
      sympathetic.






WAITRESS


Do you need help?




Emily casts her gaze around the room, smiles wryly.






EMILY


Do you know any of these people? I hate to just 
              ask a stranger, and I guess they have rules about people riding 
              along, but. . . Do you know anyone, a nice guy maybe, who would 
              be willing to give someone a lift out of town?


WAITRESS


Where do you want to go?


Emily


It doesn't matter where, it just needs to be tonight.


WAITRESS


You just sit right here, honey, i'll be right back.




The waitress stiff legs it to a table and whispers to truckers.
INT. FARMHOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
Will revels under a hot shower.
EXT. FARMHOUSE/DRIVE - NIGHT
The gate to the drive hangs open.
A car approaches -- a very expensive car with tinted windows 
      and Oregon plates -- headlights off, it parks out of sight of the farmhouse. 
      
You guessed it: Thomas Perkins.
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Scrubbed and dressed in a robe, Will pours himself a cup 
      of coffee, ambles into the spartan living room, switches a radio on to MUSIC, 
      lifts a phone, dials, and listens to it RING on the other end as he lifts 
      a remote control and switches on the MUTED TV.






JOE (V.O.)


This is Joe. I'm not here. Leave a message.




Will frowns, hangs up, and relaxes into a chair to stare 
      at the TV. Boring. He flips channels -- 
Jerks forward in his chair, and switches back a channel 
      to stare in horror at --
The TV screen shows an anchorman, the warehouse fire, a 
      charred Mercedes, more fire --
Will's jaw drops.






WILL


Oh shit.
 




Will's high school yearbook photo flashes by, a picture 
      of Emily -- 






WILL


Shit shit shit.


PERKINS (O.S.)


Interesting viewing?


WILL


Jesus!




Will spins to stare at Thomas Perkins, who steps silently 
      into the room.






WILL (CONT'D)


Who the fuck are you?


PERKINS


I'm Uncle Tom. Who the fuck are you?




Perkins holds up photocopies of mortgage deeds, studies 
      one in mock annoyance.






PERKINS


William Pogue, who owns a warehouse in Portland, 
              Oregon -- 




Studying another photocopy --






PERKINS (CONT'D)


-- William Danny, who owns a farm in Denton*, Washington?, 
              or maybe William Baker, who owns another warehouse -- you like warehouses, 
              don't you? -- in Seattle, Washington.




Perkins lowers the papers.






PERKINS (CONT'D)


I'll just call you William. Now, William, where's 
              Emily Hope? 




Perkins brings out a gun and casually begins screwing a 
      silencer into place.
EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT (RAINING)
Standing beside a rumbling semi truck, the waitress embraces 
      Emily and shoves a bag into her hands.






WAITRESS


There's food in here, to hold you over.


EMILY


Thank you Norma.


WAITRESS


Don't even think twice about it. You just get yourself 
              somewhere safe.




Emily gives her a hug, shoves bills into her big waitress 
      pockets, and swings up into the truck cab.






WAITRESS


Now blast you, I told you --


EMILY


You take that money, Norma. It's all I've got to 
              give you, and money isn't enough.




Emily slams the cab door, waves, and the semi rumbles out 
      of the parking lot.
INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT
Norma, the waitress, is wiping down a deserted counter, 
      when Will, face cut up and a bit wild around the eyes, stalks up -- wearing 
      a really nice suit. 






WAITRESS


Coffee, Hon?


WILL


I'm looking for a girl.




Norma looks Will up and down, not liking what she sees.






WILL (CONT'D)


She may have come in here. About yeah high, such 
              and such hair, thin, kinda delicate looking?


WAITRESS


She's gone.




Will sighs in relief. 






WILL


You've seen her. Do you know where she went?


WAITRESS


Somewhere you can't get your lousy hands on her, 
              is where. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.


WILL


What?


WAITRESS


Bobby? Joe?




The place is not entirely deserted -- two very burly TRUCKERS 
      glance up from their booth.






TRUCKER #1


Norma, you need something?


WAITRESS


This gentleman is looking for the little girl Mike 
              gave a ride to --




She indicates Will with her chin --






TRUCKER #2


That so?




The truckers are rising -- rising being an understatement 
      -- to approach Will.






TRUCKER #1


He the one gave her that black eye?




Norma's got her hands on her hips, staring Will down.






WILL


Now wait a minute --


TRUCKER #2


I think maybe we need to have a talk outside, Son.




INT. SEMI TRUCK CAB - DAY (MORNING)
Emily wakes up, ensconced in the bed of the truck cab, as 
      MIKE the trucker climbs into the cab with two styrofoam cups of coffee.






MIKE


Morning. Want some coffee?


EMILY


Thanks.




He hands it back to her and she cracks its cover to happily 
      breathe in steam, before taking a sip.






MIKE


Your eye looks pretty good.




Thomas Perkins' tinted windows car pulls into the lot outside.






EMILY


I'm a fast healer.




She sets the cup down and crawls to the front of the cab, 
      to get a better look -- it is definitely Thomas's car. She sucks in breath. 
      Mike frowns at the car.






MIKE


Someone you know?




She nods, tired, and drags on her shoes.
Mike's glowering at the car.






MIKE


You don't have to go out there.




Emily gives him a tired smile and a kiss on the cheek.






EMILY


Thanks for the ride and the coffee, Mike. I'll be 
              okay.




She drops down out of the cab. Mike shakes his head.






MIKE


Why do they always go back, I wonder? Nice pretty 
              girl, could have anyone she wanted, and she goes back to the black 
              eye patrol.




EXT. TRUCK STOP #2 - DAY (MORNING)
Emily braces her shoulders and walks towards Thomas's car.






EMILY


Aw, well, it was a fun ride, Em.




She sighs, and opens the passenger door.
Will glares at her from the driver's seat.






EMILY (CONT'D)


You!


WILL


Get in. 


EMILY


Fuck you. You burned my car!




She whirls and stalks back towards the truck.






WILL


I what!?




He slams out and stands there, breathing hard. She turns, 
      glaring.






EMILY


No wonder you were in such a hurry to get out of 
              there. You torched the place!


WILL


The hell I did. More likely one of your relatives 
              came to visit.




She stares at the car, his suit --






EMILY


Where's Thomas?


WILL


In the last twenty-four hours, I've been beaten 
              up by three people, threatened with a gun, insulted by a waitress, 
              and I had to run naked through the woods. So I'm not in the mood 
              to hold this conversation in the god damned rain. Now get in the 
              car.


EMILY


You ran naked through the woods?




She glances at her watch: five thirty. 






EMILY


Wow. It's not even six o'clock.




INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY (RAINING)
Emily smokes like a fiend. Will drives by reflex.






EMILY


I'm not going back.


WILL


The hell you aren't. 


EMILY


You wouldn't be in this mess, if you hadn't gone 
              around making a bunch of phone calls.




The car's cellular phone rings. Will stares at it, appalled. 
      Emily eyes it, curious.






WILL


Don't answer that.


EMILY


Who is it?




Silence. Will's jaw works.






EMILY


Uncle Tom? Uncle Tom is calling you on the phone? 
              




She laughs, delighted. He glares.






WILL (CONT'D)


If I'd known the fucking marines were on my ass 
              -- but no. It wasn't the marines. It was Uncle Tom, a much more 
              frightening individual. Where the hell did you think you were you 
              going?


EMILY


Fort Lewis.


WILL


Oh, that explains everything.


EMILY


If you must know, I was going to visit a priest.




Will snorts.






WILL 


Well now you're going to visit a policeman. Who 
              the hell is Uncle Tom?




Emily stares around the car in fascination.






EMILY


I can't believe you stole Uncle Thomas's car. And 
              his clothes. How did you do it?


WILL


I ran.


EMILY


You outran Uncle Tom?


WILL


He wasn't counting on me jumping through that plate 
              glass window.




She reaches up to touch one of his facial nicks.






EMILY


But how --




Will shoots her a deprecating glance, grits his teeth -- 
      






WILL


The clothes were in the car.




He's waiting for an explanation, seething. She sighs.






EMILY


He's not really my uncle, that's just what I call 
              him.




He rubs his eyes, tired to death of subterfuge. She sighs.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Uncle Tom does clean up for my father.


WILL


He's a janitor. Why didn't I think of that.




Will jerks the steering wheel, straightening the car's path 
      out on the road.






EMILY


When's the last time you got some sleep?




He grits his teeth.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Jesus, I bet you haven't slept at all. You can't 
              even stay on the road.


WILL


I can stay on the road.




EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY (RAINING)
Perkins' car screeches off the road -- slamming to a halt 
      amid flying pebbles and mud. 
 






WILL (O.S.)


Uncle Tom is a hit man?




INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY (RAINING)
Will stares, horrified, at Emily.






EMILY


Not exactly.


WILL


Then I wish to hell you'd tell me what "exactly" 
              Uncle Tom is.


EMILY


Okay, he's a hit man.




Will plunges off the shoulder, through weeds and mud, onto 
      the feeder road.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Where are you going?


WILL


I have to make a call.




INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY (RAINING)
Will listens grimly to Joe's answering machine.






JOE (V.O.)


This is Joe. I'm not here. Leave a message.




Will hangs up.






WILL


Jesus, Joe, where are you?




INT. JAIL CELL - DAY (MORNING)
Uncle Joe stands at the common phone, amidst the glamour 
      and glitz of a holding cell.






VOICE OVER


I'm sorry, but the number you have dialed is disconnected 
              or no longer in service at this time. If you feel you have reached 
              this recording in error --




Joe drops the phone into its cradle.






JOE


Damn. Looks like I'm walking.




A gnarled VISITOR laughs.






VISITOR


Joe, you miser, why don't you cough up for a cab?


JOE


Already had to pay the damn fine. 




A GUARD clangs the cell door.
 






GUARD


This ain't a hotel, you know, Pogue. You going or 
              staying?


JOE


I'm going. Hold your britches.




Joe shambles out.






VISITOR


Damn idiot's going to walk. Crazy assed white son 
              of a bitch.




INT. AMADEUS'S VIEWING ROOM - DAY
It truly is a viewing room, in every sense of the word. 
      Amadeus sits in a massive chair, watching a newscaster harass Dan Sims on 
      the enormous TV screen.






NEWSCASTER (V.O.)


Is it true Emily Hope, daughter of billionaire Amadeus 
              T. Hope the Third, has been missing for three days?


SIMS (V.O.)


No comment.


NEWSCASTER (V.O.)


Is it true the recent grounding of a river barge 
              was a failed attempt --




Amadeus snaps off the telecast, stares at the dark screen. 
      Thomas rises silently and refills their drinks.






AMADEUS


Do you relize how embarrassing it is to call a bank 
              president and tell him you need one million dollars replaced?




Thomas drops ice in the drinks.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


Do you realize there are eleven news vans parked 
              outside this residence? 




Thomas hands Amadeus a drink. Amadeus sips, brooding.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


Privacy, Thomas, is a rare commodity.


PERKINS


Amadeus, it's Emily.


AMADEUS 


That's no longer an issue. Someone must take public 
              responsibility for this fiasco -- that someone will not be a Hope. 
              She's in Washington?




Perkins nods. Amadeus shakes his head.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


Please tell me we aren't involving the Bureau in 
              this.


PERKINS


It's unconfirmed. It will remain unconfirmed.


AMADEUS


Is there any way we can -- 




Amadeus gestures helplessly at the TV.






PERKINS


Short of killing everyone in the news departments?




Amadeus considers the possibilities --






PERKINS (CONT'D)


No.




Amadeus sighs, strokes one of his Bonsai.






AMADEUS


They're so perfect. So controlled.




Perkins' face twitches.






PERKINS


Will you permit me to make an observation, Amadeus?


AMADEUS


Certainly, Thomas.


PERKINS


Emily is not a plant. 




Amadeus frowns.






PERKINS (CONT'D) 


Just an observation.




Amadeus turns the tree to a more complimentary angle.






AMADEUS


I'm experiencing the strangest emotions, Thomas. 
              Relief. And shame. Because I thought my daughter was dead --




He strokes the moss at the plant's base.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


-- and the thought was oddly comforting. I suppose 
              that makes me a terrible person.




Perkins doesn't say a word. Amadeus sighs.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


I don't care how you do it. Shut the circus down.




Thomas nods and heads for the door, leaving -- Thomas turns 
      to the right.






AMADEUS (CONT'D)


Thomas? 




Thomas pauses.






AMADEUS (CONT'D) 


My father was rarely present, while I was growing 
              up, yet I didn't terrorize every living soul I came in contact with.




Thomas's eyes are sad in that hard masked face of his.






PERKINS


I'm not judging you, Amadeus.


AMADEUS


Aren't you?


PERKINS


No. Just making an observation.




And Thomas is gone, leaving Amadeus alone in that big, beautiful, 
      perfectly controlled, and very empty room.
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY (RAINING)
If you want to talk grease and engine parts, "Joe's Auto 
      Parts" is sacred, if grimy, ground. The phone is RINGING. Uncle Joe, looking 
      the worse for his visit with the authorities, not to mention his walk, appears 
      outside the window and unlocks the shop door. The answering machine clicks 
      on.






JOE (V.O.)


This is Joe. I'm not here. Leave a message.




The door JANGLES as Joe pushes in. The machine beeps. He 
      stumps across the room to pick up, just as the caller hangs up.






JOE


I hate it when they do that.




Sighing, he pulls a bottle from under the cash register, 
      takes a long pull, and collapses onto a beat up stool.
INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
Dan Sims studies reports, reading each sheet, setting it 
      aside, and wearily going on to the nEXT. He pauses.






SIMS


Barnaby? You see this DUI report?




Barnaby, at the next desk, glances up.






BARNABY


You mean that old guy Pogue?


SIMS


Yeah.


BARNABY


Sure.


SIMS


Did it occur to you, this old guy Pogue, who was 
              pulled over in the vicinity of a warehouse that just happens to 
              belong to a suspect named Pogue, might be a relative?


BARNABY


Sure.


SIMS


Sure?


BARNABY


Yeah, it's his uncle.


SIMS


His uncle?


BARNABY


Yeah.




Sims stares ceilingward, praying for patience.






SIMS


Barnaby, were you going to tell me this?


BARNABY


Yeah, I probably would have gotten around to it.




Sims struggles into his jacket.






SIMS


Barnaby, I am really trying to like you.


BARNABY


We going somewhere?


SIMS


Yeah, Barnaby, I thought we might pay a visit to 
              Mr. Pogue's uncle.




INT. MOTEL #2/ROOM - DAY (RAINING)
Emily comes out of the bathroom, wearing a towel and rubbing 
      her hair with another, smoking a cigarette. 
The key rattles and Will stalks in, soaked, halts dead.






EMILY


Did you get him?


WILL


Who?




He settles warily into a chair, as far from her as physically 
      possible -- by the door.






EMILY


Whoever it is you keep calling.


WILL


You take too many damn showers.




She grabs her clothes off the floor and stalks into the 
      bathroom, leaving the door partially ajar. 
Will, uncomfortable as hell, tries to ignore flashes of 
      flesh, as she walks back and forth in there, to the accompaniment of zippers 
      and sliding material.






WILL (CONT'D)


Is there really a priest?


EMILY


The nuns at school used to make us go to church 
              -- which was boring as hell -- so I used to go to confession -- 
              to shock the priests. Told 'em I slept with all these army guys 
              and stuff.


WILL


What's so shocking about that?


EMILY


I was nine.




She comes out of the bathroom, tosses herself on the bed, 
      sniffs her shirt sleeve, grimaces, shuts her eyes.






EMILY (CONT'D)


God I hate dirty clothes.


WILL


These priests all believed a nine year old girl 
              was sleeping with army guys?


EMILY


I think Father Douglas is the only one who caught 
              on.




She shuts her eyes.
He shuts his eyes. 
He puts his feet up on the table. 
Shifts. Shifts again. Opens his eyes. Shuts them. Emily 
      opens her eyes and glares.






EMILY


If the chair's so god damned uncomfortable, sleep 
              on the bed. Your virtue will remain intact.


WILL


I'm used to sleeping alone.


EMILY 


I'll bet. All those frigging locks.




She tosses back down into the pillows, turning away from 
      him.
He turns onto his side, facing away from her. 
The rain beats down. 
There they both lie, wide awake.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Pogue, are you planning on being a car thief all 
              your life?


WILL


Are you planning on being a thorn in your father's 
              side all your life?




Stony silence. Will sighs.






WILL (CONT'D)


I'm going to Tahiti.


EMILY


You're going to steal cars in Tahiti? That's progress.


WILL


I'm going to fish. And I'm going to go first class.


EMILY


Oh, right. So what will you live on? Fish?


WILL


I have investments.




Emily laughs -- bitter.






WILL (CONT'D)


What's so funny?


EMILY


Here I thought I'd met an honest thief -- and you 
              have investments.




She's really laughing now -- but it's a brittle laugh.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Just like my father. Next, you'll tell me you have 
              a tree fetish.


WILL


Believe you me, hard as I tried, I could never fuck 
              someone up as bad as you're fucked up over your old man.




She stops laughing. He glances over at her.






WILL (CONT'D)


Don't tell me I hurt your feelings.




She throws back the covers, stumps out of bed.






EMILY


You take the bed. I'll sleep in the chair.




He shakes his head no, crosses his arms.






WILL


Chair's by the door.


EMILY


Jesus, God. Look, I give you my word, I will not 
              leave, while you're asleep. Okay? Because I would rather see you 
              get some sleep than end up somewhere dead on the highway. Will that 
              work? My solemn oath.




He looks at her, skeptical.
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
The bell JANGLES over the door and Dan Sims walks in, Barnaby 
      plodding along behind him. The only living thing in sight is an old German 
      Shepherd in the corner -- it wags its tail.






SIMS


Anybody here?


JOE (O.S.)


Yeah, yeah, hold on.




Sims leans down to pet the dog. Joe comes out of the back, 
      glares at the dog.






JOE


Veronica, you're supposed to bite the burglars, 
              not welcome them in.




Veronica's tail wags harder.






JOE (CONT'D)


What can I do you for?




Dan flashes a badge.






SIMS


Are you Joseph Pogue?


JOE


Nope. He ain't here.




Sims squints at Joe.






SIMS


When do you expect him back?


JOE


Dunno. He went on a fishing trip. Maybe a week or 
              so.


SIMS


Would you happen to know where?


JOE


Nope.


SIMS


How about his nephew, William Pogue? You ever see 
              him around here?


JOE


Sorry. Only worked here a coupla weeks.




Sims gives him a hard look.
 






SIMS


And what would your name be?


JOE


Dennis Hodges.


SIMS


You got any identification, Dennis Hodges?


JOE


Nope.




Sims glowers. Joe shrugs.






JOE (CONT'D)


I don't drive.


SIMS


You know it's against the law to lie to a police 
              officer, Mr. Hodges?


JOE


Now I do.




Sims slaps his card on the counter.






SIMS


You hear from Pogue, you call me. 


JOE


Will do.




Sims and Barnaby JANGLE out the door. Joe picks up the card, 
      studies it.






JOE


Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.




The Shepherd flops its tail.
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR (OUTSIDE JOE'S AUTO PARTS) - DAY
Sims steams. Barnaby starts the engine.






SIMS


There is something wrong here. I don't know what, 
              but something is not right.


BARNABY


You mean with Pogue?


SIMS


What do you mean, "Do you mean with Pogue"?




Barnaby inclines his head towards Joe's Auto Parts.






BARNABY


That was him back there.


SIMS


How can you tell? The station picture is shit.


BARNABY


Went to school with him.




Sims' jaw drops.






SIMS


You might have said something sooner.




Barnaby shrugs.






BARNABY


You want to go back and talk to him?


SIMS


Oh, right. Excuse me, Mr. Pogue. My partner just 
              happened to mention. . . he won't tell us anything now. 


BARNABY


Nope.


SIMS


But I want the place watched.


BARNABY


Okey-dokey.




Barnaby pulls out. Sims jerks his seat belt forward -- it 
      sticks. Disgusted, he drops it, past trying to get the damn thing to work.
INT. THOMAS PERKINS' NEW AND IMPROVED DISCREET AUTOMOBILE 
      (OUTSIDE JOE'S AUTO PARTS) - DAY
Thomas, expressionless and immaculate as always, watches 
      Barnaby and Sims pull away.
Beside him on the seat, the red LED on a high tech phone 
      monitoring device blinks.
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
Barnaby drives, nonchalant. Dan Sims broods.






SIMS


Barnaby, let me ask you a question.


BARNABY


Shoot.


SIMS


What do you think is happening here?




Barnaby scratches his neck, thinks a moment.






BARNABY


You want to know what I think?




Sims is getting belligerent.






SIMS


Yeah. Just out of curiosity, I want to know what 
              you think.


BARNABY


Well, lemme see. I think old man Hope thought his 
              daughter was setting him up, so he didn't get too riled, thought 
              he'd just play along. Then, when the car wasn't there with her in 
              it, he got worried and called in the big guns -- that'd be our mysterious 
              Mr. Perkins. But the kidnapper we're after wasn't a kidnapper, he 
              was a car thief -- seeing as he's Joe Pogue's nephew, and Pogues 
              aren't into kidnapping, they're into cars. You know his daddy was 
              a racer? So the kid took the car, but then he found the girl in 
              it, which put him in a fix. So he was trying to figure out what 
              to do about it, without getting tangled up with the law, when that 
              old lady put the finger on him and the cops showed up. Then he ran 
              -- skittish lot, the Pogues -- and the girl probably went with him 
              -- but he forgot to take the coffee off, so the whole place burned 
              down. Now old Pogue's sweating it, 'cause he hasn't heard from his 
              nephew in a while, and young Pogue and that girl are somewhere out 
              in tarnation.




Sims just stares, slack jawed. Barnaby glances at him.






BARNABY (CONT'D)


That's what I think.


SIMS


You thought that all out.


BARNABY


Yep.


SIMS


And you never thought to mention it.


BARNABY


You didn't ask.




Sims collapses back into his seat, thinking.






SIMS


What makes you think the kid's a car thief?


BARNABY


Got busted way back, musta been about fourteen at 
              the time, for auto. Bad crowd he was running with, after his daddy 
              died.


SIMS


He did.




Barnaby nods.






BARNABY


You'd know these things, if you were from around 
              here.


SIMS


You don't like me much, do you Barnaby?


BARNABY


I got nothing against you. I just wonder, sometimes, 
              how come you're out here, instead of back in your own town.




Seconds tick by as Sims considers.






SIMS


You ever been to Los Angeles, Barnaby?


BARNABY


Nope.




INT. MOTEL #2/ROOM - DAY (RAINING HARD)
RAIN beats against the roof. Thunder RUMBLES and Will jerks 
      awake, stares around the room panicked, relaxes when he remembers where 
      he is --
And stiffens when he sees Emily's gone.






WILL


God damn it.




He struggles free of tangled bed clothes, jerks open the 
      door to stare out at the gray sheet of rain, and cursing, plunges into it.
EXT. MOTEL #2/PARKING LOT - DAY
Will, dashing through the rain --






WILL


Stupid stupid stupid --




The car is still there, and intact.
He turns to stare at the abandoned lot. 
The neon motel sign spits in the gray rain, shooting weak 
      illumination. Even the office looks dead.






WILL (CONT'D)


Shit. I give you my solemn oath. Yeah, right. Stupid 
              stupid stupid.




LIGHTNING shoots across the sky, casting everything into 
      black and white lines, and there, on the hill behind the hotel, is a small, 
      still figure standing in the rain.






WILL (CONT'D)


Emily?




He wipes rain off his face -- like that does any good -- 
      and trudges up the hill through a growing stream of mud and water. And sure 
      enough, it's her.






WILL (CONT'D)


Emily, what are you doing out here?




She just stands there, holding the front of her shirt away 
      from her body to stare down at an enormous black blotch on it, as the rain 
      sleets down her.






EMILY


I stained my shirt.


WILL


What?


EMILY


I was playing with the god damn motel pen, and it 
              broke, and now I've got ink all over my shirt.




Will stares at the ragged shirt -- scruffy, torn, dirty 
      -- he laughs.






WILL


Emily, that shirt needs to be burned.


EMILY


I hate god damn stains.




Emily starts crying. He blanches, puts his hands on her 
      shoulders, staring at her in consternation.






WILL 


Hey, hey, it's just a beat up old shirt.




This isn't having the desired effect -- she's bawling.






WILL (CONT'D)


We'll buy you a new one. Here, you can have my shirt 
              --




He's struggling out his shirt.






EMILY


No no no. The rain comes and it washes the whole 
              world clean. It just doesn't wash the people clean. We're all stained, 
              Will. 


WILL


How long have you been out here, Emily?




She shrugs. He takes her hands, rubs them.






WILL (CONT'D)


Jesus, you're cold. Come on.




He tugs. She resists, rain plastering her face and hair. 
      He wipes a sodden strand out of her face.






WILL (CONT'D)


Anybody can change, Emily.


EMILY


Like you're going to change, Will, when you get 
              to Tahiti?




INT. MOTEL #2/ROOM - DAY (RAINING)
They're soaked and Emily's teeth are chattering as Will 
      pushes her into the motel room chair and crouches to drag her shoes off 
      and rub her feet. 






EMILY


That hurts.


WILL


I bet.




He grabs a discarded towel, rubs her hair.






EMILY


Rain never killed anyone.


WILL


The hell it didn't. You've got to get out of these 
              clothes.




She smiles, tired. He meets her eyes -- eyes for once candid 
      and just plain young and tired.






WILL (CONT'D)


Thanks for not leaving.




She reaches out with a cold, gentle hand, to touch his face, 
      so close, leans forward, kisses him. . . .
It's a long kiss -- before he breaks away. She frees the 
      first button of her shirt.






WILL


No.


EMILY


I need you.


WILL


You don't need me. You need something, but it's 
              not me.


EMILY


Don't you ever get lonely, Will Pogue? Living behind 
              all your locks and chains and secrets, don't you ever need another 
              human being?


WILL


I can't afford the stakes you play for, Emily.
 


EMILY


Yes you can, Will. Just for a moment. Just to be 
              human.




And she kisses him again, and what he should do -- or might 
      regret -- doesn't matter.
INT. MOTEL #2/ROOM - DAY
Emily lies awake by Will's side in the bed, staring at the 
      ceiling, listening to Will's soft breathing. He rolls over, kisses her, 
      smiles one of those shit eating grins everyone wears, when they're in love 
      with the world because they just got laid.






WILL


Hi.


EMILY


Hi.




She's distant. Will drags clothes off a chair, frowns at 
      the wrinkled suit, but climbs into it anyway.






WILL


You okay?


EMILY


I don't want to go back.




He loses a bit of the rosy glow.






WILL


Emily, it's hard truth time. I have to go back. 
              I have to check on someone. And you have to go back. To clear up 
              this mess. 




He straps on his watch. She turns to stare at the wall. 
      He touches her face.






WILL (CONT'D)


I would truly love to hide out here with you forever, 
              but that's not going to work, and you know it. For one thing, because 
              Uncle Tom is going to come through that door one of these days and 
              kill me dead for making you suck my penis.




He smiles, trying.






EMILY


Fine.




She grabs her clothes off the floor and drags them on, purposefully 
      ignoring the stain.






WILL


God, I could eat a horse.




INT. RESTAURANT/PAY PHONE - DAY
Will, relieved enough to be rude, speaks into the phone.






WILL


Where the hell have you been?




INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS/LIVING QUARTERS - DAY
Joe, casual, speaks into the phone. 
intercut:






JOE


Jail.


WILL


Jail?


JOE


Yep.


WILL


What the hell --


JOE


Pardon me for intruding, Will, but did you know 
              your warehouse burned to the ground?


WILL


Yeah, I know.


JOE


I ask because I don't know if you've got TV's where 
              you're at.


WILL


You want to know what's going on?


JOE


Nope. Nope. I don't want to know. I'd rather not 
              know. But I thought it might be good to be sure you know.


WILL


I know.


JOE


Then I figure you'll take care of it. When're you 
              coming home?


WILL


I'm on my way.


JOE


Well that's good. Things're a might peculiar around 
              here, though. You might want to wear a hat.


WILL


I'll do that, Uncle Joe.


(beat)


Uncle Joe, there haven't been any strangers around, 
              asking questions, have there? Maybe a guy in a suit?


JOE


A nice suit, or a cheap suit?


WILL


A nice suit.


JOE


Just cops.


WILL


That's good.




INT. THOMAS PERKINS' NEW AND IMPROVED DISCREET AUTOMOBILE 
      - DAY
Thomas smiles -- not a nice smile -- snaps off his phone 
      tapping device, and straightens his cuff, obscuring a military tattoo.
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
Emily, shivering slightly, picks at her food, looking miserable. 
      A plate of fish sits across the table from her, growing cold.
Will slides into the booth.






EMILY


You get through?


WILL


Yep. 


EMILY


Congratulations. I ordered you the fish.


WILL


Oh.




He eyes the congealing creature with an expression less 
      than rapturous, but takes a manful bite and swallows.






WILL (CONT'D)


Said the cops have been by.


EMILY


What's wrong with the fish?


WILL


Nothing. What I'm going to do is drop you off at 
              the police station. Then I'm going to get the hell out of there, 
              while you go in and introduce yourself. 




Emily, watching him wince his way through the fish, eyes 
      his plate, frowns.






EMILY


What's wrong with it.




Will sets down his fork with a sigh.






WILL


Emily, I'm sorry. I hate fish.


EMILY


You hate fish.




She stares out the window -- coming to a decision here, 
      building up inside defenses -- 






EMILY (CONT'D)


I think you should go to Tahiti, Will. Just get 
              on that plane and go. Forget all this mess -- and take a few steaks 
              along, for insurance purposes.


WILL 


Am I missing something here?


EMILY


Missing something?




She gives him a cool stare.






WILL


Maybe I'm taking a lot for granted. But I thought 
              something happened here.


EMILY


Yeah, something happened here. It's called sex, 
              Will.


WILL


Uh huh.


EMILY


And suddenly, after having sex, you seem to be thinking 
              I'm going to be changed into a nice person and I'm going to go trotting 
              into some police station and announce myself to the world.




Will isn't attempting to eat fish anymore.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Don't ever make that mistake, Will, of thinking 
              I'm a nice person, just because we had sex, because if there's one 
              thing I'm not, it's nice.




Will's sitting there, waiting for the punch line. It doesn't 
      come. The silence grows.






EMILY (CONT'D)


I'm pregnant, Will.




He stares at her blankly.






WILL


There's no way.


EMILY


Not last night. Before last night.


WILL


How -- oh, shit. 




He's working through it, adjusting -- comes back at her 
      just as tough as she's coming at him.






WILL (CONT'D)


I can live with that.




Ouch -- she didn't expect that -- she recovers fast.






WILL (CONT'D)


Who?




She hits him with a hard, cold stare -- these are the big 
      guns.






EMILY (CONT'D)


I don't really remember. 




She pulls out a cigarette, lights up. 
Will stares at it, at her, the implications sinking in. 
      
She blows smoke, a thin cloud growing between them.






Will


Emily?


EMILY


What, you're still here?


WILL


No. You're right. I think it's time I go.




He stands stiffly and stalks for the door.
Emily watches him go with a crooked, pained smile. 
EXT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
Thomas Perkins strolls to the door of the shop, sparing 
      a casual glance for the undercover car outside --
INT. SECOND UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
A weary detective watches Joe's place, Will's high school 
      yearbook photo on the seat beside him, and, unfortunately, the detective 
      doesn't know, or care, who Thomas Perkins is, and spares him only a passing 
      glance.
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
The door JANGLES and Thomas strolls to the counter. The 
      German Shepherd flops its tail against the wall. Joe, behind the counter, 
      glances up, studies Perkins' suit.






JOE (CONT'D)


Sorry, I'm closed.


PERKINS


Joseph Pogue?


JOE


He ain't here.


Thomas


Really? Then perhaps you can tell me where he is?


JOE


Got no idea. You wanna leave a message, though, 
              I'll see he gets it when he comes back.




Thomas slides a fifty dollar bill onto the counter.






Thomas


I would like very much to speak with him.




Joe eyes the money.






JOE


That's too bad, 'cause he ain't here.




Thomas's eyes narrow and he retracts the fifty.






PERKINS


Mr. Pogue, you may not want my money, but you are 
              going to speak to me.




Silence.






PERKINS (CONT'D)


Perhaps you don't understand, Mr. Pogue. I'm very 
              serious.


JOE


I told you, Joe Pogue ain't here.




Thomas pulls a gun (silenced) from his shoulder holster, 
      turns, and shoots the German Shepherd dead.






JOE (CONT'D)


Veronica?


PERKINS


As I said, Mr. Pogue, I'm very serious.




Joe wobbles around the counter's edge, not quite believing 
      that old dog is dead.






JOE


Oh, shit, Veronica?




INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY
Will drives, seriously pissed, passing Highway Five South 
      signs too fast -- and then it hits him.






WILL


She's lying. 




He jerks the wheel and screeches to a halt on the shoulder 
      -- which gets him an unfriendly HORN blast from the car behind him -- and 
      laughs, amazed. 






WILL (CONT'D)


Man, she is good. Those poor priests.




And then he sobers.






WILL (CONT'D)


If she's not lying, you are about to make one hell 
              of a fool of yourself, William Pogue.




He stares out the window, drumming his fingers on the wheel. 
      Drumming drumming drumming --






WILL (CONT'D)


Fuck it.




He spins the wheel and makes a very illegal U-turn.
EXT. RECTORY - DAY
Will rings the bell, shifts feet a few times, waiting. The 
      RECTORY PRIEST opens the door.






RECTORY PRIEST


May I help you?


WILL


I'm looking for Father Douglas?




The Priest studies Will, who's not up to boy scout standards 
      today -- in fact, Will resembles a seriously scruffy character.






RECTORY PRIEST


I'm sorry, he's unavailable. Perhaps you could tell 
              me what this is regarding?


WILL


No, I need to speak to Father Douglas personally. 
              Could you tell me where he went?




The priest checks his watch.






RECTORY PRIEST


He should be back in a couple of hours, if you'd 
              like to come back.




The priest starts to shut the door -- starts, only, because 
      Will blocks it.






WILL


This is urgent.


RECTORY PRIEST


If it's urgent, you can talk to me.




Will's losing patience.






WILL


No, I need to speak to Father Douglas.


RECTORY PRIEST


Then I can't help you.




The priest starts to shut the door again -- 
Will strong arms the door.






WILL


Look you, I need to speak to Father Douglas, and 
              I need to speak to him now.




The priest blanches.






RECTORY PRIEST


Father Douglas is taking confessions.


WILL


Thank you.




INT. CHURCH - DAY
Will Pogue's footsteps echo, slap slap slap, across the 
      hard floor. It's an intimidating church, but he's not into being intimidated 
      right now, he's into getting to the confessional. Still -- he genuflects 
      and shoots a token knee bend at the alter, old habits dying hard.
At the confessional, there's a line. He pauses, less sure 
      of himself, takes his place at the end. 
And way up there, at the front of the line, there are two 
      confessionals. He studies them.






WILL


What now?




A WOMAN in front of him turns.






WOMAN


Excuse me?


WILL


Nothing. Sorry.




She eyes his wrinkled clothing, before turning a stiff back 
      on him. 
Nothing for it, he waits -- receiving odd glances from little 
      old ladies ahead of and behind him.
INT. RECTORY - DAY
The rectory priest dials an old fashioned, black, rotary 
      phone.
INT. CHURCH - DAY
Will's next in line. An elderly woman steps from one of 
      the confessionals. He plunges in.
INT. CONFESSIONAL - DAY
Will sits awkwardly in the booth. The shade rolls back.






WILL


Are you Father Douglas?
 




The PRIEST clears his throat -- a hint. Will crosses himself.






WILL (CONT'D)


Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned repeatedly 
              and it's been years since my last confession, but if you aren't 
              Father Douglas, I don't want to talk to you.


PRIEST


May I ask why, then, you're here?


WILL


I'm looking for a girl.




Silence.






WILL (CONT'D)


So if you could just tell me --


PRIEST


Did you say you were looking for a girl?


WILL


Uh, maybe I should explain --


PRIEST


Next door.




Will boggles.






WILL


Excuse me?


PRIEST


Next door.


WILL


A girl?


PRIEST


You'll find Father Douglas in the next confessional.


WILL


Oh. Uh, okay.


PRIEST


Unless, of course, you'd like to take advantage 
              of the circumstances.


WILL


No, I'll just be going now.




Will reaches for the door --
INT. CHURCH - DAY
Will, crimson faced, takes his place at the end of the line 
      again. He's getting truly curious glances from waiting confessors.
INT. CHURCH - DAY
Will's first in line again. An elderly woman steps from 
      the confessional he entered the first time. Drat! He pretends not to notice, 
      shifts his weight, staring at the second confessional. 






WILL
(under his breath)


Come on, come on --




A WOMAN behind him taps him on the shoulder.






WOMAN


I think it's free now.


WILL


Uh, no, you go ahead. I'm waiting for the next one.




She ogles him, before going ahead. He's embarrassed as hell, 
      getting stares, standing there, trying to be cool. A woman steps out of 
      the second confessional and he bolts for it.
EXT. RECTORY - DAY
A police cruiser pulls to the curb. As the COP steps from 
      the cruiser, the rectory priest Will had the doorway altercation with steps 
      forward to meet him.
INT. SECOND CONFESSIONAL - DAY
Will sits awkwardly in the booth, relieved to be off display 
      -- until the shade rolls back.






WILL


Father Douglas?




The PRIEST coughs, a hint. Will genuflects -- stops himself.






WILL (CONT'D)


Look, the guy next door said you were Father Douglas, 
              and I've got to talk to Father Douglas, so you either are or are 
              not Father Douglas. 




Silence. Will starts to sweat.






WILL (CONT'D) 


If you are, I need to talk to you. If you aren't, 
              just tell me where Father Douglas is -- I'll get out of your hair 
              and you won't have to worry about me till last rites.




It is, by the way, FATHER DOUGLAS.






FATHER DOUGLAS


It might be wise to see me sooner than that.


WILL


Are you Father Douglas, or aren't you?


FATHER DOUGLAS


I'll be through here in an hour. Perhaps we could 
              speak at that time?


WILL


You're Father Douglas.


FATHER DOUGLAS


Yes.




Will expels a big sigh of relief.






WILL


I have a message for Emily Hope.




Silence. 






WILL (CONT'D)


You do know Emily Hope?


FATHER DOUGLAS


Are you Catholic?


WILL


What does that have to do with it?


FATHER DOUGLAS


Answer the question, please.




Will glances around guiltily.






WILL


Yes.


FATHER DOUGLAS


Then you know I can't answer your question.




Will's about had it with obstacles. He rips out paper and 
      pen, and scribbles.






WILL


Fine. I'm writing down an address and phone number. 
              And if you should happen to see Emily Hope, you tell her I can be 
              reached here for the next twenty-four hours. And then I'm gone.




Will shoves the paper through the grill.






WILL (CONT'D)


Oh, and Father? Tell her I thought she was tougher 
              than this.




INT. CHURCH - DAY
Will, stepping out of the confessional, stops dead when 
      he sees the rectory priest approaching with the COP.






WILL


Aw, shit.


RECTORY PRIEST


That's him, officer.




Will, looking for somewhere, anywhere, to hide, ducks back 
      into the confessional. 
The confession crowd is wild with anticipation. 
The cop comes to a dead stop outside the confessional.






COP


I can't go in there.




The rectory priest raps on the door.






RECTORY PRIEST


Young man, come out of there immediately!




No answer.






RECTORY PRIEST (CONT'D)


Do you hear me, young man? I said come out!




Father Douglas, looking holier than God, steps from the 
      confessional, to the further excitement of the crowd -- 






FATHER DOUGLAS


What is the meaning of this?




The cop pales -- he wasn't prepared for a stand off with 
      God.






RECTORY PRIEST


The man inside --


FATHER DOUGLAS


Is a confessor. Since it is not, as far as I know, 
              yet a crime to attend confession, we are not yet in the habit of 
              dragging confessors out of the booth. Am I clear, Father Michael?


RECTORY PRIEST


Very, Father Douglas.




Father Douglas turns to the cop.






FATHER DOUGLAS 


Thank you for coming. Your services won't be necessary 
              today.




The cop nods, gulps, and goes. Father Douglas turns to the 
      rectory priest.






FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D)


Would you care to explain?




The rectory priest falters, casts an anxious glance at the 
      avid spectators -- at this point, no one is entering either of the confessionals. 
      He lowers his voice.






RECTORY PRIEST


I was concerned for your safety, and. . . 




(oh, this is going to sound bad)






RECTORY PRIEST (CONT'D)


I called the police.


FATHER DOUGLAS


I see.




The rectory priest shoots a dour glance at the booth.






RECTORY PRIEST


He was quite forceful.




Father Douglas sighs, opens the confessional door. Will 
      and he lock eyes.






FATHER DOUGLAS


It was good seeing you again, William. 




Will reacts, eyes narrowing momentarily.






WILL


Right. Good seeing you again, Father.




Will steps awkwardly from the booth.






FATHER DOUGLAS


And William?


WILL


Yes?


FATHER DOUGLAS


Ten Hail Marys, ten Our Fathers.




Will's jaw drops.






FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D)


You may go.


WILL


Right.




Will GOES. Father Douglas turns back to the rectory priest.
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS/LIVING QUARTERS - DAY
The place is a reflection of Joe: old, worn -- too much 
      bad news has passed through here, leaving behind a yellowed, tarnished tone 
      of loss that clings to every item in the room. Joe himself is not looking 
      too good right now either -- probably because Thomas Perkins is beating 
      the crap out of him.
Thomas pauses. Joe coughs. Thomas lifts Joe's bottle and 
      offers Joe a swig, which Joe takes thankfully.






PERKINS


Joe, you have to understand, I don't enjoy beating 
              up old men. Especially military men like yourself. But your nephew 
              is in possession of something I must find.


JOE


Don't know where he is. Haven't heard from him. 
              In days.


PERKINS


Really, Joe.




Perkins gently removes the bottle from Joe's hands.






PERKINS (CONT'D)


We both know you're lying.




Joe reaches pleadingly after the bottle.






JOE


Please --


PERKINS


Sorry, Joe. 




Thomas hits him again.
EXT. CHURCH - DAY
Will stands in the shadows, watching the cop study Will's 
      "borrowed" automobile.






WILL


What is this, pick on Will Pogue week?




The cop eyes the out of state plate, scribbles the number 
      on a pad, lifts his radio mike.






WILL (CONT'D)


Look, I promise to say the hail marys, I promise 
              to say the our fathers, hell, I promise to confess, next chance 
              I get, if that bozo just walks away from the car. Honest. A full 
              confession. And no more cars. Not ever.




The cop's radio SQUAWKS, the cop hops into his cruiser, 
      turns on his SIREN, and screams out of the parking lot.






WILL (CONT'D)


You're kidding?




Thunder rumbles. Will casts an appalled glance at the sky.
INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY
Will's screaming down the highway, muttering under his breath.






WILL


Hail Mary, full of grace. . .




EXT. GARDEN - DAY (OVERCAST)
Emily sits on a rock, staring into space, as dark clouds 
      rumble past. Father Douglas walks up behind her.






FATHER DOUGLAS


I have a message for you.




Emily covers her face with her hands.






EMILY


Aw, shit.




Father Douglas drops Will's paper into Emily's lap.






FATHER DOUGLAS 


There's a phone in the rectory. You may use it.




He turns away.






EMILY


Don't you judge me.




He turns back.






FATHER DOUGLAS


I don't judge you, Emily. That's not my job.
 


EMILY


Then what do you call this superior attitude?


FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D)


Frustration? What did you tell him, anyway?


EMILY


It doesn't matter. It didn't work.




Father Douglas laughs.






EMILY (CONT'D)


What did he say?


FATHER DOUGLAS


He said he thought you were tougher than this.


EMILY


Shit shit shit.




Father Douglas raises his eyebrows.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Sorry, Father.


FATHER DOUGLAS


We'll make a Catholic out of you yet, Emily.




Emily shakes her head, almost smiles at the old joke.






FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D)


Emily, that young man is in a great deal of trouble 
              because of you.


EMILY


It's not like he's a saint, Father. He did steal 
              a car. A lot of cars.


FATHER DOUGLAS


That he did. I have to return. Will you be all right?


EMILY


I'll be fine.




Father Douglas starts down the path, pauses, and turns.






FATHER DOUGLAS


Oh, and Emily?


EMILY


Yes?


FATHER DOUGLAS


He appeared to have a great deal of -- character.




Emily watches Father Douglas disappear down the path.






EMILY


Touché, Father.




INT. RECTORY - DAY
Emily squints at the number on Will's paper, lifts the phone, 
      dials -- and hangs up.






EMILY


I can't do this.




She picks up. Hangs up. Picks up.
A grotesque crucifix stares down at her from the wall. She 
      glares back at it.






EMILY (CONT'D)


I can't do this, all right!




The crucifix glowers -- no, it's not all right.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Same to you, buddy.




But she picks up and angrily dials, glaring at the crucifix 
      the whole time.






EMILY (CONT'D)


This is not a good idea. You know that.




The phone RINGS on the other end, and is picked up by Thomas 
      Perkins.






PERKINS (V.O.)


Joe's Auto Parts.




Emily freezes.






PERKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)


Hello?




She hangs up gently, backs slowly from the phone, turns, 
      and bolts for the door.
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
Joe is definitely looking the worse for wear. Thomas hangs 
      up the phone, smiles.






PERKINS


We should be expecting company soon now.


JOE


Coulda been anybody.


PERKINS


I doubt it.




Perkins gives Joe a good whack -- enough to put him out, 
      which is a damn hard whack.






PERKINS (CONT'D)


Nothing personal.




INT. RECTORY - DAY
The rectory priest huffs into the study to ogle Father Douglas.
 






RECTORY PRIEST


Are you aware a young woman just drove off in the 
              Church sedan?


FATHER DOUGLAS


Yes. I gave her the keys.




The rectory priest pauses, reassessing.






RECTORY PRIEST


She appeared rather distraught.


FATHER DOUGLAS


I believe she was, yes.


RECTORY PRIEST


Should we. . . ?


FATHER DOUGLAS


No, Michael. We should not.




Father Douglas drapes an arm around the rectory priest's 
      shoulders, walks him gently towards the door.






FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D)


Michael, police are only men. Around here, we rely 
              on God to sort things out.


RECTORY PRIEST


Yes, Douglas, but --




Father Douglas raises a finger to hush him.






FATHER DOUGLAS


No buts, Michael. I learned a long time ago, his 
              way is the best way.




EXT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
Will saunters up the street, just a casual guy in a baseball 
      cap and sunglasses, just ambling along to pick up some parts for his car 
      -- and pushes through the front door of Joe's Auto Parts.
INT. SECOND UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
The cop in the under cover car glances at him, at the picture, 
      but hey, nobody actually looks like their high school yearbook picture. 
      Not really. And the cop goes back to his long wait for nothing.
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
Will slouches in. No one around. 






WILL


Joe?




Silence. Will glances at Veronica's corner -- empty.






WILL


Joe? Veronica?




Silence. He strides to the cash register --






WILL (CONT'D)


'Bout time you walked that dog. 




-- bangs the cash drawer open -- too much cash in there.






WILL (CONT'D)


God damn it, Joe, I keep telling you, don't leave 
              this stuff around.




He opens the safe in the cupboard below the register, takes 
      a passport out, stashes it in his front pocket, grabs cash from the register 
      drawer and stows it in the safe -- 






PERKINS (O.S.)


Are you robbing the place?




Will spins to see Perkins in the doorway to the back.






WILL


Uncle Tom.


PERKINS


Very good. Do you know what Uncle Tom wants?


WILL


I didn't make her suck my penis, if that's the next 
              question.


PERKINS


Her father will be relieved to hear that.




Perkins motions.






PERKINS (CONT'D)


In back, please.


WILL


I don't think so.


PERKINS


It's not a request.


WILL


Sorry.




Perkins shoots Will in the leg -- the gun's silenced, natch.






PERKINS


Now. Shall we try again?




EXT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
The church sedan, if the logo is any indication, screams 
      into the parking lot -- which actually does get the undercover detective's 
      attention -- and a very recognizable Emily falls out of the car in her hurry 
      to get to the door.
INT. SECOND UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
The undercover detective scrabbles for his radio.






UNDERCOVER DETECTIVE


Jesus Christ, I've got Emily Hope here -- I need 
              back up, now!




INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
Emily slams in the door, knocking the jangling bells clean 
      off their hook, glances around -- no one there -- sees the door to the back 
      and keeps going --
To stop dead in the doorway.
LIVING QUARTERS
Joe's still out cold. Will, however, is very much awake, 
      not to mention in pain, leaning against a table, his leg bleeding. Perkins 
      holds his gun at a nonchalant angle, addressing Will.






PERKINS


A medical team could --


EMILY


Thomas.




Perkins turns to study Emily.






PERKINS


You did do it.


EMILY


Yes. Let them go.


PERKINS


It would be best if you waited in the car, Emily.




EMILY




It's just a game, Thomas.




PERKINS




Sometimes, the game becomes real. That's something 
              I forgot to teach you, evidently.




EMILY




There's a cop outside, Thomas, and his friends are 
              on their way.




WILL




Emily --


EMILY


Shut up, Will.




Emily fingers the necklace at her throat -- Thomas's gift 
      of long ago.






PERKINS


In sixty seconds, that won't be a problem. Never 
              start something you can't finish, Emily. 




Will is reaching under the table -- cautious, so cautious 
      not to attract Perkins' attention with his movement -- because the thing 
      Will is stretching fingers for is a good old fashioned revolver strapped 
      to the bottom of the table --
Perkins turns and draws down on Will --






EMILY


Uncle Tom!




And she's bringing a gun up to bear on Thomas -- staring 
      at his face --
								DISSOLVE TO:
SERIES OF SHOTS:


A)	Emily, a little girl, crying at her mother's funeral 
          -- Amadeus, too distracted to notice a three year old child -- Thomas 
          taking her hand, leading her away --
B)	Emily, a little girl, running down the steps of 
          that big, empty, Hope house --







YOUNG EMILY





Uncle Tom!


And Thomas lifting her up in the air to swing her around 
          while she laughs --
C)	Amadeus, studying a young Emily --







AMADEUS





Emily, you're growing too attached to Thomas. It's 
              important you understand what Thomas does for this family


D)	Emily, teenaged, crying in a car, as Thomas slides 
          into the driver's seat




EMILY


But you hurt people!


PERKINS


Emily, that's my job.


EMILY


Why do you hurt people --




INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS/LIVING QUARTERS - DAY
Everything is slowing down as Thomas goes combat, eyes flat, 
      instinct taking over, turning and drawing on Emily --
Her finger isn't moving on the trigger, isn't responding, 
      because she is not going to be able to shoot this man -- 
But he is able, is going, to shoot her, his finger 
      tightening -- and then he meets her eyes --
Combat mode switches off, and he's human again, staring 
      at her, knowing her, Emily, not the enemy --






EMILY


I love you, Uncle Thomas.


PERKINS


I love you too, Emily.




All those shared years, all those lessons, and in that look, 
      he's saying good-bye, because they both know what the last lesson is -- 
      Thomas spins away, drawing down on Will --






EMILY


NO!




Will draws that old revolver, firing -- missing --
Thomas pulls the trigger, hitting Will in the shoulder, 
      spinning him back against the wall --






EMILY (CONT'D)


NO!




And Emily raises her gun and fires ---
EXT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
Cop cars screaming into the lot, cops coming out guns drawn 
      and heading inside, as GUNSHOTS blast O.S. --
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS/LIVING QUARTERS - DAY
Thomas takes a solid hit -- Emily's -- as he fires at Will 
      again, the hit throwing his aim off -- the bullet slugging into the wall 
      as Emily ducks, hands over her ears, screaming --






EMILY (CONT'D)


No no no no no --




Will firing and this time he isn't missing -- 
Thomas falling, falling, as Cops come in the door, weapons 
      drawn --






COP


Freeze!




Will turning in surprise -- not a good move, holding a gun 
      -- 






WILL


Not me --




-- dropping the gun as a cop squeezes the trigger --






EMILY


Stop it --




Will slamming back into the wall, surprised, because he 
      just took another bullet in the shoulder --






EMILY


Stop it! He didn't do anything!




And Thomas still falling, to land and bounce, land and bounce, 
      land and lie still --






WILL


I'm hit?




Cops grabbing Will, SIRENS Screaming b.g. --
Emily crawling to Thomas, crying --






EMILY


Uncle Tom! God no no no --




Will looking back at her as she raises her tear streaked 
      face and mouths "Please" -- 
Uniforms surrounding her, AD LIBBING are you hurt, are you 
      all right, where does it hurt, blocking Will out -- 
Emily looks down at Perkins --






EMILY (CONT'D)


I finished it, Uncle Thomas. Oh, God, I am so sorry, 
              I finished it, and I should never have listened to you -- 




And just closes her eyes, not wanting to see any more -- 
      as Will passes out.
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
Amadeus, Emily, and Father Douglas stand grave side.






FATHER DOUGLAS


Would you like to say a few words, Mr. Hope?




Amadeus shakes his head no.






FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D)


Emily?




Emily removes that long ago birthday necklace, and places 
      it on the headstone, shakes her head.






FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D)


I'll leave you alone with him.




Father Douglas strides away, and there they are: Emily and 
      Amadeus. Alone at last.
Seconds tick by.
Amadeus removes a sub-atomic speck of lint from his cuff.






AMADEUS


Thomas was a good man. 


EMILY


Thomas was not a good man. Thomas was an assassin. 
              But he was the only father I ever had.


AMADEUS


That would explain why you shot him in the back.




She jerks, struck hard, studies him through hard, unshed 
      tears.






EMILY


All these years, I thought it was me. That there 
              was something ugly and wrong about me. And if I just tried hard 
              enough, you'd care. But it's always been you. Ugly and broken.


AMADEUS


He was my friend, God damn it.


EMILY


I was your daughter. 


AMADEUS


As distasteful as you may find it, Emily, you're 
              still my daughter. And I'm still your father.


EMILY


No. I just buried my father. 




She turns and walks away, across that big expanse of death, 
      towards waiting cars, and life.
Amadeus watches her retreating back, turns away, adjusts 
      his cuff.






SUIT #1 (O.S.)


Amadeus Thadeus Hope?




Amadeus turns to face two stern faced, over-barbered, sunglass 
      wearing SUITS -- i.e., federal agents.






AMADEUS


Yes?




The suits flash badges.






SUIT #1


You're under arrest for conspiracy and withholding 
              information related to a federal crime.


SUIT #2


If you'll step over to the car, Mr. Hope?


AMADEUS


What are the grounds for these charges, gentlemen?


SUIT #1


Were you aware, Mr. Hope, that Mr. Perkins kept 
              a ledger of his activities? 




Amadeus pales. The suit cracks a grim faced smile.






SUIT #1


It's quite comprehensive.




EXT. SIDEWALK BY CEMETERY - DAY
Sims and Barnaby lean against a limousine, much to the CHAUFFEUR's 
      chagrin, watching Amadeus and the suits.






SIMS


They got him.


BARNABY 


Yup.


SIMS


Amazing.




Emily, ignoring the detectives, strides to the limo, where 
      the chauffeur leaps to open her door.






CHAUFFEUR


Will we be waiting for Mr. Hope, Miss?




Emily is pulling herself together, getting frosty.






EMILY


No. Mr. Hope has provided his own transportation.


SIMS


Miss Hope?




Emily frowns at the detective.






EMILY


This is not the time or the place, Detective.


SIMS


I'm running out of times and places, Miss Hope. 
              And you're a little hard to reach.




Silence.






SIMS


Look, we know about the car.


EMILY


What about the car, Detective?


SIMS


We found the car in William Pogue's warehouse.


EMILY


I sold that car to Mr. Pogue.


SIMS


While you were kidnapped, you sold the car?


EMILY


No. Before my abduction, I sold the car.


SIMS


This would be before Thomas Perkins abducted you, 
              then?


EMILY


Precisely.


SIMS


Miss, do you know lying to a police officer is a 
              crime?


EMILY


Yes, I'm perfectly aware of that, Detective. I'm 
              also aware you have no case.




Sims settles back on his heels to study her warily.






SIMS


Actually, I have quite an interesting case, Miss 
              Hope.




Emily smiles, winsome, charming -- the angel again.






EMILY


Detective Sims, I owe you an apology. I'm sure my 
              father has put you through living hell -- and I'm largely responsible 
              for that. Please accept my apology.




Sims blinks. Emily's face hardens.






EMILY (CONT'D)


However, Detective Sims, you should also be aware 
              I'm a superb liar. 




Sims opens his mouth -- Emily raises a hand to cut him off.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Superb, Detective Sims -- and stinking filthy rich. 
              In other words, if you attempt to pursue this further, I will drag 
              your ass through the worst press campaign it has ever seen -- I 
              will embarrass you to death, Detective Sims, and then I will obliterate 
              you in court. Is that clear?


SIMS


Quite.




Emily smiles, steps into the limo, and the chauffeur slams 
      the door.
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY
Sims and Barnaby sit watching the limo disappear down the 
      street, its exhaust trail dissipating until there's nothing left but a thin 
      cloud.






SIMS


What do you think, Barnaby?


BARNABY


I believe her.


SIMS


So do I. 




Sims casts a sideways glance at Barnaby's profile.






SIMS (CONT'D) 


You know, I'm beginning to like you, Barnaby.




Barnaby shrugs and starts the engine. Sims reaches for his 
      seat belt, stops, scrutinizes it. The damn thing works. He eyes Barnaby. 
      
Barnaby doesn't bat an eye, just pulls away from the curb 
      -- and Dan snaps his belt home.
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY
The bell JANGLES, and Emily Hope stalks in, puffing a cigarette. 
      Uncle Joe squints at her from behind the counter. She extends her hand.






EMILY 


I'm Emily Hope.




Joe ignores the hand.






JOE


I know who you are. And I don't allow smoking in 
              my shop.


EMILY


You have Will's winning personality, I see.


JOE


Yep.




She smiles.






EMILY


Then we ought to get along just fine.




EXT. PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY (DUSK)
Will leans against his Porsche -- the window's fixed --watching 
      his planes.
A cab approaches, its tires crunching gravel.
He glances over his shoulder at it. It stops and Emily climbs 
      out. Will turns his back on her.
She crunches up to lean against the Porsche beside him, 
      as the cab pulls away.






WILL


Letting that driver go might have been a mistake.


EMILY


Yep.


WILL 


I tried calling, you know.


EMILY


I didn't get the messages.


WILL


For a month.


EMILY


You called twice.


WILL


What do you want, Emily.


EMILY 


Thought you'd be in Tahiti by now. Catching fish 
              you won't eat.




Silence.






EMILY (CONT'D)


Decided to stick around and steal cars instead?


WILL


I'm retired.




She lights a cigarette.






WILL (CONT'D)


You were never pregnant, were you?


EMILY


Nope.


WILL


You're a damn fine liar. I just think I've had enough 
              of liars for the time being.


EMILY


I'm retired too.




Will rounds on her.






WILL


Jesus God, Emily. I killed a man. Because of you. 
              And I don't know how I can live with that. Let alone if I can live 
              with that.


EMILY


I'm sorry, Will.


WILL


You don't know what sorry means. And you probably 
              never will.




He stalks to the Porsche, drags the door open, leaving.






EMILY


I know what sorry means. I know damn well what sorry 
              means, Will Pogue.




She throws her cigarette away, hugs herself, staring off 
      into the growing dusk. . . 






EMILY (CONT'D)


Shit.




She fumbles a plane ticket out of her purse and throws it 
      on the ground.






EMILY (CONT'D)


I bought two tickets to Tahiti, Will Pogue. And 
              you can either be on that plane, or you can sit here staring at 
              them for the rest of your life. Frankly, I don't give a damn which 
              you choose. But I do know what sorry means.




She turns and crunches away across gravel, headed for the 
      distant terminal lights. 
It's starting to rain, big wet drops out of the sky, falling 
      down.






WILL


Are they first class tickets?




Emily slaps an angry tear, or maybe it's a raindrop, away.






EMILY


What?


WILL


I said, are they first class tickets?


EMILY


What do you think?




Will lifts the ticket, wipes a raindrop off it, which is 
      quickly replaced by another, and another.






WILL


Round trip?




Emily crosses her arms and shoots him a "don't push your 
      luck" type glare.
He opens the passenger door. 
She's thinking about it? He rolls his eyes. 
She crunches back, climbs in. 
He climbs in, starts the car.
And the Porsche pulls away, crunching over gravel, turning 
      onto tarmac, as a plane crosses over our heads and we:
 
									FADE OUT:







 
THE END




BACK 
                      TO TOP
