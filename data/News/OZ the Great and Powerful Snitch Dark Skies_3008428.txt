0Z THE GREAT AND POWERFUL

THE SOUND OF THE WIND -- whistling -- as we --

FADE IN:

EXT. KANSAS PRAIRIE —- EARLY EVENING

A gray land under a gray sky -- everything flat, drab,

dreary. A ramshackle farmhouse -- a creaky weather vane -- a
dirt road stretches to nowhere -- but then we see, up ahead,
looming over the horizon: A LARGE LIGHTER-THAN-AIR BALLOON --
below which we find:

EXT. THE BAUM & BARLEY BROS. CIRCUS

 

Not exactly the Greatest Show On Earth, but still a pretty
big deal around here. People have come from far and wide --
their modes of transport and their styles of dress telling us
we're in the very early 1900s.

Townsfolk and farmers stroll the midway... barkers shout
their come-ons... a Bearded Lady preens... the crowd oohs and
aahs at the Daring Young Men On The Flying Trapeze... then we
see, in the Menagerie: elephants and monkeys and a lion and
a tiger and a bear (oh my)... then we come to:

EXT./INT. OZ'S EXHIBITION TENT

Where the audience gazes listlessly at the two men up on
stage. The fast-talking huckster in the velveteen frock-coat
is none other than OSCAR ZOROASTER PHADRIG ISAAC NORMAN
HENKLE EMMANUEL AMBROISE DIGGS -- a.k.a. ‘0Z'’ for short --
and he’s standing with his back to the second guy, who looks
to be some local businessman.

OZ
Now, we don’t know each other, do
we? We’ve never met, you and I.

FRANK

No, sir, we sure haven't.
OZ

And your name is --?
FRANK

Frank.
OZ
Short for Franklin.

FRANK
That’s right.

OZ
Lucky guess. Now, Frank, you got
‘em on there good and tight?

Now we see: Oz’s hands are handcuffed behind his back.
FRANK gives the cuffs a yank and --

FRANK
They're tight all right.

OZ
Thank you, Frank -- and might I
just say you’re a credit not only
to your community but to the great
state of Kansas itself -- ad astra
per aspera and E Pluribus Unum.
(Frank starts to leave)

But before you go, I was wondering:
Would you happen to know the time?

FRANK
Well, sure, I...

He dips into his vest pocket -- frowns -- starts patting his
other pockets and --

OZ
Is this what you’re looking for?

And 0z triumphantly brings his arms out from behind his back.
In one hand he’s holding the handcuffs from which he’s just
escaped -- in the other he’s dangling Frank’s pocket watch by
its chain. Frank takes his watch back, seems wowed -- and 0z
turns to the crowd, takes a bow, but --

Not_a_single person claps -- everyone’s just looking at him
about as animated as cows.
OZ
Heh-heh, yes, well -- please, no
need to applaud -- your awestruck

expressions of amazement are
approbation enough. So, moving
right along... I have in my hand
here a flea. Can everyone see
that? You in the back?

(of course they can’t;

there is no flea)

(MORE )
OZ (cont'd)
Now, this is no common, ordinary
flea -- no, this is a flea with

dreams, who dreams of someday
becoming a shining white dove.

A VOICE seems to cry out from the side of the stage --

VOICE
That’s crazy!

OZ
(cups an ear)
What’s that? What’s that you say?

VOICE
I’m saying it can’t be done, turn a
flea into a dove!

The Voice is Oz’s own -- he’s a damned good ventriloquist.

 

OZ
A naysayer, eh? Well then:
Witness and observe.

He deftly passes one hand over the other -- and now he’s
holding a LARGE WHITE EGG. He places it in a SMALL, BARRED
CAGE, covers it with a cloth, raises it up, snaps off the
cloth, and... there’s now a LITTLE WHITE BUNNY RABBIT inside
-- and Oz appears perplexed...

OZ
But... that’s not a dove. Let’s
try this again.

He covers the cage once more, holds it high -- then SNIFFLES.

OZ
Sorry. I’m allergic to rabbits.

Then suddenly he SNEEZES -- such a tremendous ah-choo that he
lets go of the cage and doubles over in two -- and the cage
somehow, magically, stays right where it is just hovering
in mid-air -- a pretty neat trick, actually -- then 0z
straightens up and, with a flourish, he snaps the cloth off
the cage to reveal: a SNOWY WHITE DOVE. Oz opens the cage
door, the dove flies out, Oz takes another bow -- and this
time, one well-dressed, very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN actually does
applaud. Her HUSBAND, a stern-looking character with a waxed
mustache and a bowler hat, silences her with a scowl.

 

Disappointment flickers across Oz’s face -- an artist
unappreciated... his shoulders slump, his head droops... then
he quickly glances up again -- with a wickedly sly grin.
OZ
I_know what you want...

He starts striding the stage like a barnstorming preacher.

OZ

Yes, I can see that you’ve come
here today in search of more than
just Magic and Illusion. You're
here, Brothers and Sisters, because
of a burning thirst -- you’re here
because, in these most difficult
times, you're looking for something
that will soothe your tortured
spirits and ease your troubled
minds. And I am here to tell you
good people...

(hands in prayer)
.-+. I might have just the thing.

 

 

He drags a TALL MAGICIAN’S WARDROBE CHEST to the front of the
stage, flings open its double doors to reveal: BOTTLES AND
BOTTLES OF HIGH-OCTANE HOOCH.

OZ
Behold, my friends, a very special
batch of my very own Homeopathic
Ontological Miracle Elixir --
H.O.M.E. or “Home” I call it, and
believe me, there’s no better place
or product anywhere on this green
earth -- a hundred and eighty proof
and only fifty cents a bottle!

And this is indeed what the crowd’s been waiting for. They
surge towards the stage, waving their money in the air.

OZ
Easy now! Easy! There’s plenty
for everyone!

(as he’s raking it in)

Mr. Morgan, good to see you again!
Mr. Gulch, how’s the banking biz?
Mr. Hamilton, you’re looking well --
and your lovely wife? Oh there she
is! -- glad you both could make it.

MR. HAMILTON’s the man who scowled his pretty wife silent
before -- and we see that MRS. HAMILTON’s standing towards
the back of the tent, watching as her husband toddles off
with his drinking buddies -- then she turns a very warm and
inviting smile towards Oz.

  
EXT./INT. OZ'S EXHIBITION TENT - A LITTLE LATER

The show’s over, the crowd’s gone. And behind a curtain to
the side of the stage we find... Oz and Mrs. Hamilton --
locked in a torrid embrace.

OZ
You do know how to bewitch a man,
Margaret. Your emerald eyes, your
ruby lips...

MRS. HAMILTON
(nuzzling his neck)
If I’m such an enchantress, why
can’t I ever cast a spell that
would get you to stay?

OZ
Stay? You mean here? In Kansas?
I could never do that.

MRS. HAMILTON
Why not? I’m in Kansas.

OZ
Yes, and you’re the only glimmer of
color in this gray land.

MRS. HAMILTON
(laughs )
The only glimmer? And those other
women of yours --?

OZ

Are mere baubles. You, my dear,
are the one true jewel.

(she kisses him, then)
You know I can’t stay -- all this
endless, empty sky -- I’m telling
you it’s crushing me. I watched
this land grind my Daddy to dust
and I’m not gonna let that happen
to me! There’s a whirlwind inside
me, Margaret, and I don’t know
where it’s gonna take me -- I just
know there’s a better world out
there somewhere, a world of color
and light and beauty, where Fortune
and_ Glory are waiting for me! I've
got diamonds in my future -- I just
know it!

He said all that with considerable feeling. He says this
with considerably less:
OZ
You could come with me.

MRS. HAMILTON
That’s very sweet. But we both
know you don’t mean it. Besides,
you know what they say: “East is
East, West is West, Home Is Best.”

OZ
You sound like a pillow in the
parlor.

MRS. HAMILTON
And I'm soft in all the right
places, too.

OZ
Yes, you are.

Another kiss -- then both pull back. Oz reaches inside his
vest, sets that bunny on the floor.

OZ
Now where were we?

EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - PICNIC AREA - SAME

Mr. Hamilton and his cronies have just finished the last of
their several bottles of snake oil.

MR. HAMILTON
Who’s up for more?

Everyone is, apparently. They start tottering back to:

INT. OZ’S EXHIBITION TENT - MOMENTS LATER

The men come in, see no one, are about to turn and go when
they hear, behind the curtain: A feminine gasp and giggle.
Mr. Hamilton angrily strides forward, rips back the curtain --
and finds Oz and Mrs. Hamilton, intertwined.

OZ
I can explain.

(off Hamilton's glare)

You're right, I can’t, which means,
sir, you're in luck!

(Hamilton stops, confused)
‘Cause right now, today, absolutely
free of charge, you get to watch
me... disappear.
And he bolts, hightails it out of there. Mrs. Hamilton

pseudo-swoons into her husband's arms, giving Oz just enough
time to make his getaway. Mr. Hamilton flings Margaret aside
and he and his buddies take off after Oz, and we launch into:

A FURIOUS CIRCUS CHASE -- OZ RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE

DOWN THE MIDWAY... PAST THE MENAGERIE... THROUGH FREAK SHOW
ROW -- the freaks and roustabouts doing what they can to help
Oz out (and it seems this isn’t the first time an irate
husband’s been after Oz), then Oz ducks under a canvas into:

THE BIG TOP -- where he scuttles under the bleachers, sprints
across Center Ring -- only to find the exit blocked by Mr.
Hamilton and his posse. Oz turns on a dime, swiftly scales
the AERIALISTS’ LADDER -- and Hamilton’s right up after him,
hot on Oz’s heels, then OZ GRABS THE TRAPEZE -- AND SWINGS

OUT... centrifugal force soon swings him back -- Hamilton
nearly grabs him -- then when Oz pendulums back the other way
again HE LETS GO OF THE TRAPEZE -- free-falls down into the

TRAMPOLINE NET, then CATAPULTS right off it and SOMERSAULTS
OVER THE HEADS OF HAMILTON’S MEN and zooms out the exit --

FROM THE LIGHTER-THAN-AIR BALLOON: We see Oz racing towards
us -- he starts SHIMMYING UP THE MOORING ROPE -- fast enough
that an exuberant ON-LOOKER exclaims:

ON-LOOKER
Look at him go! He’s faster than a
flying monkey!

And we now see: THE BALLOON HAS THE WORD “OZ” EMBLAZONED ON
ITS SIDE. Oz heaves himself into the balloon’s hanging

 

basket -- just as Hamilton and his boys run up, grab hold of
the mooring rope, start hauling the balloon back down to
earth -- then Frank comes running up with a satchel --
FRANK

Oz! Here you go!
And he hurls the satchel up to Oz -- Oz catches it, tips his
hat in thanks (Frank, of course, is Oz’s long-time assistant
and shill) -- then Oz looses the mooring rope and --

THE BALLOON LIFTS SKYWARD -- out of harm’s and Hamilton’s
reach -- up and up and up, Oz waving goodbye to everyone --
laughing -- that was fun -- but then he notices: Only Mrs.
Hamilton and Frank are waving back at him... everyone else is
stopped and turned towards the west... Oz himself looks and --

OZ
Sweet Jumpin’ Jiminy.
SEEING: A MASSIVE STORM FRONT -- angry black clouds, closing
in fast. Everyone on the ground suddenly breaks and scatters

 

for cover. Oz gulps --

OZ
Looks like we might be in for a bit
of a gale.

As if on cue: A vicious gust of wind kicks up, nearly throws
Oz out of the basket -- a TIDAL WAVE OF DUST SWEEPS OVER THE
CIRCUS, vanishes it from view -- then, to the west, a LONG
BLACK SWIRLING FUNNEL starts its malevolent descent from the
clouds... OZ HUNKERS DOWN, braces himself, then it hits:

THE STORM OF THE CENTURY

Plunging us into deepest darkness -- howling, hurricane-force
winds -- crashes of lightning -- torrents of rain -- and 0z
is caught right in the worst of it -- it’s a HELLACIOUS DEATH
RIDE -- he’s getting whipped and whirled, bashed and battered
-- bellowing Lear-like defiance:

OZ

Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!
Rage! Blow!

A DEAFENING CLAP OF THUNDER drowns him out, and abruptly we:

CUT TO:

EXT. OZ - ON THE FLOOR OF THE BALLOON BASKET —- MORNING

Dead asleep. Soaking wet. Wisps of steam rising from his
clothes because: he’s now bathed in brilliant sunlight. He
twitches awake, eyes flicking, relieved to find himself:

 

OZ
Alive.

He pulls himself up to peer over the side and sees:

AN ENDLESS EXPANSE OF DESERT. Nothing but sun-scorched sand
as far as the eye can see.

OZ
I don’t know where on Earth this
is, but... I’ve got a feeling I’m

not in Kansas anymore.
THE BALLOON SAILS ON... and on... and on... and we --

DISSOLVE TO:
THE SUN -- blinding, relentless -- the balloon drifts by...

EXT. OZ - ON THE FLOOR OF THE BALLOON BASKET

Looking very much the worse for wear. He scrounges through
his magician’s satchel for probably the umpteenth time,
looking for something, anything to eat and drink. Pushing
aside various gadgets and gizmos, he finds a flask, upends it
over his mouth, but... nothing; it’s empty. He finds a
crumpled food wrapper, licks the last few specks of crumbs
off it... then he pulls out --

A SMALL, NICKEL-PLATED DERRINGER PISTOL... he hefts it, seems
to be weighing a decision, but --

OZ
No -- don’t even think it. You're
gonna get out of this.

-- squinting up at the terrible sun, knowing full well that
if he doesn’t make it out of this searing Sahara soon, he’s
done for. And then: The situation gets even worse. THE
ENGINE STARTS TO SPUTTER AND DIE, out of fuel. Oz leaps to
his feet, bellows:

OZ
No! You can’t do this! Not here,
not now! NOOO! Please-please-
please-please-please.

-- caressing the machine -- sweet-talking to it -- he fiddles
with it -- tries to fix it -- finally starts hammering on it
with his fist.

OZ
Damned technology! Fine, then --
go ahead! -- betray me you

Jezebellian jumble of junk! I’ve
been in more perilous predicaments
than this!

(beat)
.-. Although, off the top of my
head I can’t quite remember when.

THE BALLOON is quickly losing altitude -- sinking towards the
desert sands. Oz realizes this could be it.

OZ
And I never got to see Paris. Or
the Pyramids. Or the Taj Mahal,
or... well bust my buttons!
10.

SEEING: DEAD AHEAD -- A TOWERING MOUNTAIN RANGE

 

Jagged peaks -- soaring into the clouds. And suddenly: A
DESERT THERMAL SENDS THE BALLOON SHOOTING SKYWARD -- all Oz
can do is hold on and hope for the best... the balloon soars

HIGHER AND HIGHER --

INTO THE CLOUDS -- a world of white -- snow-capped mountains
below... Oz shivering with the sudden cold...

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS -- the balloon drifts down
out of the clouds... then it actually crosses...

OVER A RAINBOW... Oz gaping down in wonder at the ROYGBIV
stream of colors -- then he sees it, spreading out before him
like a lysergic fantasy...

THE LAND OF OZ

And from above it’s astonishingly beautiful -- a riot of
color and lushness and light -- everything somehow tinged
with yellow... and Oz can’t believe his eyes -- or his
incredible good fortune -- murmurs to himself:

OZ

If I’m dreaming don’t wake me.

The balloon continues its graceful descent... Oz continues to
marvel -- then he brightens even further when he sees:

OZ

Water. Water!

A RIVER -- sparkling in the sun. The balloon bumps to the
ground right beside it, and Oz leaps from the basket,
laughing like a crazy man, RUNS AND THROWS HIMSELF INTO THE
WATER -- giddily drinking, splashing, playing -- Hallelujah!
Saved! -- but then he can’t help but notice...

PEOPLE -- GATHERED BY THE RIVERSIDE

 

A lot of people, normal-sized people, all of them oddl
dressed in some hue or shade of yellow, and they’re all just
gaping at him. Oz comes out of the water, dripping wet --
and all the people take a step or two back. Oz nods hello --

 

 

OZ
How do you do? My name’s Oz.

And they all bow down to him! Like he’s a King or a God --
and Oz doesn’t know what the hell to make of it.
11.

OZ
Well that’s... thank you -- that’s
very kind. But if you don’t mind
my asking: Where am I?

A WINKIE MAN ventures forward -- who looks and sounds a lot
like the Winkie Guards did in The Movie.

WINKIE MAN
Why, you're here, sir.

OZ
Yes, I, I understand that, but...
where, my good man, is here?

WINKIE MAN
The Land of Oz, of course!

OZ

The Land of Oz? You're kidding me.
You call this place 02?

 

WINKIE MAN
Far as I know that’s been its name
since just short of forever.

OZ
If that don’t beat all... I mean,
what are the odds?

And the Winkie Man turns to the others and proclaims:

WINKIE MAN

He’s here! The Great Oz is finally
here!

And everyone CHEERS, long and loud -- then they start hugging
and kissing and shaking hands with one another --
tremendously happy and relieved, and --

OZ
You people certainly know how to
make a stranger feel welcome -- but

why all the hullaballoo?

WINKIE MAN
It’s just -- we've been waiting
ever so long, sir -- and we are all
very glad and grateful for what
you're about to do!
12.

OZ
And, ah, not to be obtuse, but...
what, exactly, is it that I’m about
to do?

A SECOND WINKIE MAN steps forward.

WINKIE MAN #2
Deliver us from the Wicked Witch!

OZ
The Wicked what?

But before he can get an answer: All sound abruptly stops --
a sudden hush -- everyone now looking west -- where we see:
SOMETHING... FLYING TOWARDS US -- and at first it’s too far
away for us to tell what it is, but soon we see it’s:

A YOUNG WOMAN -- TRANSPORTED BETWEEN TWO WINGED MONKEYS

OZ
Am I seeing what I think I’m

seeing? Flying monkeys? Now I
know I’m not in Kansas anymore.

And as the Winged Monkeys swoop down and gently set the Young
Woman on the ground, the Winkies all bow deeply again. Meet:

THEODORA -- and she is beautiful. Dressed in an open-
collared white shirt, black pants, black knee-high boots.
She has quick eyes, quick movements, a quick, lively mind --
and Oz likes what he sees.

OZ
You can’t be the Wicked Witch.

THEODORA
(laughs )
Is that what they told you?

OZ
No. But they did just mention
something about there being a
Wicked Witch, so --

THEODORA
Well, I am a Witch -- but do I look
wicked to you?
She smiles -- he smiles back, with charm --

OZ
On the contrary.
13.

THEODORA
They were no doubt referring to the
Witch of the South, who is indeed
very wicked and who is trying to
overthrow my sister the Queen.
(then, looking past him)
Is that yours?

-- gesturing towards the still semi-inflated balloon.

OZ
Yes, yes it is.

THEODORA
Why does it say “Oz” on it?

OZ
‘Cause that’s my name. Oscar
Zoroaster Phineas Isaac Norman
Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs, at
your service.
(tips his hat, grins)
You can call me Oz.

THEODORA
I’m Theodora.
(then)
So, Oz, tell me: What are you?

OZ
What am I? Why, I’m an American --
a Kansas man, born and bred.

THEODORA
But are you a Wizard? Ora
Sorcerer? -- as the Winkies here

seem to believe?

OZ
The Winkies?

THEODORA
These are the Winkies. You landed
in Winkie County, the western-most
quarter of the Land of Oz.

OZ
And they think I’m a Wizard?

THEODORA
Why wouldn’t they? You just came
out of the clouds, you fell from
the sky, and you call yourself Oz.
(really needs to know --)
(MORE )
14.

THEODORA (cont'd)
So: Are you a Wizard? The Wizard
we've all been waiting for?

And Oz can’t help himself -- the showman in him takes over.

OZ
As a matter of fact, back home I am
known as something of a Wizard -- a
Wizard of Pyrotechnics and
Prestidigitation -- I’m also a
renowned charlatan and a Master of
Illusion -- and if you good folks
would permit me just a moment of
your kind indulgence, allow me to
both Illustrate and Amaze!

He struts over to the balloon, takes his satchel from the

basket -- (the satchel, by the way, also has the name “OZ”
embossed upon it) -- he picks out a few props and --
OZ

Okay, gather around everyone --
proximity only adds to the wonder --
can I have a volunteer? How about
you, madam? That’s right -- don’t
be shy...

And as Oz starts his shtick we: FOCUS ON THEODORA... who’s
watching Oz very closely -- watching his magic and, more
important, she’s watching the effect his tricks are having on
the Winkies, because: Watching 0z’s act, the Winkies are
becoming more and more convinced that Oz does have Special
Powers -- that he is, in fact, a Wizard -- and it’s hard to
tell how Theodora feels about that... Oz finishes, takes a
bow, turns to Theodora and ta-da’s.

 

 

THEODORA

So you are a Wizard, aren’t you?
OZ

Seeing is believing -- and I try

never to contradict a pretty lady's

eyes.

He smiles -- like a fox -- she smiles back, says --

THEODORA

Well, then...

She gives a quick flick of her hand, and: LIGHTNING FLASHES
FROM HER FINGERTIPS -- ARCS INTO THE BALLOON and --
15.

 

KA-BOOOOOM! -- THE BALLOON ERUPTS IN A GIANT FIREBALL -- a
huge hydrogen conflagration -- towering flames -- the Winkies
shielding themselves and cowering -- Oz is sputtering --

OZ

Wh-wh-wh-what’d you do that for!

THEODORA
(sweet as spun sugar)
I couldn't just let you leave,
could I? -- my sister would never
forgive me. She could use a Great
Wizard like you.

OZ
Use me? For what?

THEODORA
To help her defeat the Wicked Witch
once and for all.

OZ
And you think I can do that?

THEODORA
I think you should come to the
Emerald City and speak to my dear
sister. And you should know: My
sister is a very powerful Witch...
you help her and I’m sure she’d
give you anything you ever
wanted...

 

OZ
Anything I ever wanted... and she
can do that, your sister?

THEODORA
She can make your every dream come
true.

OZ

(greedy grin)
Y'know that doesn’t sound half bad.

THEODORA
No it doesn’t, does it?

Oz glances towards the burning balloon.

OZ
And, circumstances being as they
are: Tell you what.

(MORE )
16.

OZ (cont'd)
I will henceforth and immediately
cancel all my planned and prior
engagements, and I will speak to
your noble sister -- Wizard to
Witch, as it were -- see what we
can arrange.

Theodora signals to NIKKO, one of the Winged Monkeys, who
flaps to her side, hands her some parchment and a quill.

THEODORA
I’1l send word, let her know we’re
on our way.

OZ
We? You’re coming with me?
THEODORA
(writing)
There could be... dangers along the
way. The Emerald City’s a full
day’s walk from here -- at the end

of the Yellow Brick Road.

OZ
We're walking?

She rolls up her note, hands it to Nikko, who flies off.

THEODORA
This one will carry your things.

KALA'S the other Winged Monkey. He fetches 0z’s satchel.

OZ
But why are we walking? You’re a
Witch -- you don’t have a broom?
THEODORA

What would I do with a broom?

OZ
You could fly us to your sister’s.

THEODORA
With a broom? I don’t understand.

OZ
(sees she’s not joking)
Never mind.

Then he leaps up on a tree stump, booms to the Winkies --
17.

OZ
Before we go I just wanted to thank
you one and all for your
wonderfully warm welcome and your

heartfelt hospitality -- I’m never
going to forget it and I hope to
see around next time -- you've been

a great crowd!
He hops back down, says to Theodora --

OZ
This place we’re going --

THEODORA
The Emerald City.

OZ
I do like that name -- green,
y’understand, has always been my
favorite color.
(rubs his hands and grins)
Let’s go, then -- no time to waste
-- opportunity awaits!

They start out -- not on the Yellow Brick Road yet; the road
here is just cobblestone -- Kala monkey-walking behind them --
the Winkies bowing deeply in farewell -- and when they rise:

Winkie #2 sees the troubled look on Winkie #1’s face.

WINKIE MAN #2
What is it?

Winkie #1 just frowns, shakes his head -- shakes off his
concern -- then shouts to the others --
WINKIE MAN

Spread the word, far and near: The
Great Oz is finally here!
EXT. EN ROUTE TO THE EMERALD CITY - OZ, THEODORA AND KALA

Through rolling farmland, past curious-looking houses --
which all look vaguely like human faces.

 

OZ
So tell me about this Wicked Witch.

THEODORA
Her Father was the King -- a very
powerful Wizard and a very Evil
King.

(MORE )
18.

THEODORA (cont'd)
The Wicked Witch of the South is
also very Evil -- and a very
powerful Sorceress -- stronger even
than my sister.

OZ
But your sister’s the Queen.

THEODORA
My sister has me to help and
protect her -- and she has the love
of the Good People of Oz.

We see that Kala’s frowning, as Theodora says, musingly --

THEODORA

They used to be friends, you know,
my Sister and the Wicked Witch...
but she had no idea how wicked
wickedness could be, or how easily
friendship could be betrayed.

(then)
Ah -- there it is -- the Yellow
Brick Road.

IN THE DISTANCE: THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD -- on the other side
of a thunderous RIVER.

EXT. THE RIVER
Up close we now see that the river’s wide, fast, and deep.

OZ
How we going to get across?

THEODORA
We'll walk.

Oz looks dubious -- as Kala picks leaves off a strange-
looking bush. Theodora takes a few, hands them to Oz.

THEODORA
Here. Rub these on the bottom of
your shoes.

Kala pantomimes how to do it. Theodora rubs leaves on the
bottoms of her boots -- Oz follows suit, then watches as
Theodora steps out on the water -- and that’s onto the water,
not into the water -- and Oz can’t believe it, can’t wait to
try it himself -- and he strides out, and when he sees he’s
not going to sink he laughs with absolute delight, as --

 

QZ AND THEODORA LITERALLY WALK ON WATER

 
19.

And 0z is about as graceful as a baby giraffe -- he’s new to
this, and it’s hard to keep your balance when white-water’s
whooshing and swooshing beneath your feet -- so he teeters
and totters, several times he nearly falls -- laughing his
fool head off all the while -- Theodora walks across stately
as a queen -- Kala wings his way to the other side -- and
when they all reach dry land --

OZ
That’s the most fun I ever had
outside of St. Louis.

Then he sees, right up close now, glowing golden in the sun:

THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD

OZ
But that looks... no, it can’t be.

He rushes forward, drops to his knees, starts scratching at
the Yellow Brick, then exclaims --

OZ
It is! Look at this! This is
pure, solid gold!
(Theodora’s unimpressed)
You don’t find this incredible?

THEODORA
They don’t have roads where you
come from?

OZ
Not paved with gold, no -- except
in people’s dreams.

THEODORA
Then you’ve come to the right place
-- ‘cause I assure you, Wizard,
this is no dream.

OZ
Well in that case... for the
behoovement of the common good and
in the interest of one and all I
think it’d probably be best if I
took one of these little beauties
along with me...

He starts prying loose one of the Gold Bricks.
20.

OZ
Strictly for scientific purposes,
you understand -- to ascertain and

ensure that this is in fact the
eighteen-carat Real McCoy rather
than pyrite -- iron disulfide --
Fool’s Gold, in the vernacular. A
Public Service I’m only too happy
to provide gratis, free of charge.

He slips the Brick into his pocket and stands.

OZ
The Emerald City’s this way?

THEODORA
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

EXT. ON THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD - A LITTLE LATER
Oz spots: AN ENCHANTED APPLE ORCHARD.

OZ
Apples! I’m starving!

THEODORA
I'd ask first if I were you.

OZ
Ask who? There’s nobody --

THEODORA
Them. The apples are theirs, after
all -- and they can be quite picky.

Oz frowns, but when in Rome... so he bows to the trees and --

OZ
Excuse me, hate to bother you, but
my companions and I were wondering
if perhaps you could spare us a
couple of your fine-looking apples.

He waits. Nothing happens. Oz glances back at Theodora, is
about to just go and pick an apple anyway, when --

ONE OF THE APPLE BRANCHES FLICKS TOWARDS HIM -- like it’s
swatting away a fly -- and three apples sail through the air,

 

tumble to the ground, roll to a stop at 0z’s feet.
21.

OZ
Uh, thank you -- appreciate it.
(picks up the apples,
remarks to himself)
Remarkable.

Then he offers an apple to Theodora, who says --

THEODORA
No. Thank you.
OZ
C'mon, you’ve gotta eat.
THEODORA
(smiles)
You don’t know much about Witches,
do you?
OZ
I wouldn't say that -- I’ve known

plenty of Witches in my time,
believe me. There was a Witch I
knew in Wichita -- you want to talk
about wicked?

(shudders at the memory)
She had a face lovely as a summer
day -- and a heart as black as a
Midnight Grave.

He tosses an apple to Kala, takes a bite of his own, Theodora
looking as though she’s still trying to figure this guy out.

THEODORA
We should go. It’1ll be getting
dark soon.

EXT. IN THE HAUNTED FOREST

Deep, dark, forboding. A YELLOW-EYED OWL hoots from a tree.
Below, Oz adds another armful of wood to a cold woodpile,
then steps back -- as Theodora flashes lightning out of her
fingertips again -- THE WOODPILE BURSTS INTO FLAME --

 

OZ
Someday you’ve really got to teach
me that.
22.

EXT. THE CAMPFIRE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Theodora’s staring thoughtfully into the fire -- Kala’s

picking bugs off his fur (and eating them) -- and Oz is at
his satchel -- slips that purloined Gold Brick into the case,
then takes something out...
OZ
Thought we could do with a little

music.

Shows her: A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE MUSIC BOX. He winds it up,
sets it on the ground -- MOZART STARTS TO PLAY... and
Theodora’s face lights up with an almost-childlike wonder and
delight -- completely charmed --

THEODORA
What is that?

OZ
It’s Mozart.

THEODORA
Why’s it called a Mozart?

OZ
No, the music is Mozart. This is a
Music Box -- you’ve never seen one?
Then here -- take it -- it’s yours.
A gift, from me to you.

THEODORA
Why? Why would you do that?

OZ
No reason -- I just want you to
have it.

She hesitates -- then holds out her hand...

THEODORA
No one’s ever given me something
just because he wanted to.

OZ
I can’t believe that -- pretty lady
like you? I bet there are lots of
men out there who’d give you the
world if they could.

THEODORA
Like I said: you don’t know much
about Witches, do you?
23.

OZ

Maybe not, but I’m told I'ma
pretty fast learner.

(stands, extends a hand)
Dance, m’ lady?

(off her look)
Now you’re gonna tell me no one’s
ever danced with you before?

THEODORA
(almost a whisper)
No one ever has.

OZ
Then it’s high time you learned a
little something. C’mon.

And he reaches down, hauls her to her feet -- takes the Music
Box from her, winds it up again and sets it down -- then he
turns to her as the MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY --

OZ
Okay, then -- put your hand up --
like this. Good. Now put your
other hand around me like so...

He takes hold of her up-raised hand, puts his right arm
around her, gets a little closer and says --

OZ
Now just try and feel the music,
and follow me...

They start to DANCE -- Kala watching them very closely --
their bodies touching -- backlit by the fire, and --

CLOSE ON THEODORA’S FACE -- and it’s true: she’s never
danced with a man -- never been held by a man -- she’s never
before felt some of the things she’s feeling now...

OZ
You seem a little nervous.

THEODORA
This is all... new to me.

OZ
It always is -- every time.

She glances up -- their eyes lock and hold. The music ends --
and she takes a step back -- voice shaky --
24.

THEODORA
I... the fire, I’1l -- I’1l gather
some more wood.

She flitters off into the darkness -- Kala scuttling after
her -- and Oz shakes his head, chides himself --
OZ

You're the wicked one, Oscar Diggs.
WITH THEODORA -- RUNNING -- STUMBLING -- THROUGH THE WOODS
Excited, frightened, confused -- hand to her belly, as if
she’s trying to quell the strange new emotions within -- Kala
still looking at her with great interest -- then he glances

up, hears the flapping of wings and --

NIKKO SWOOPS IN -- TOUCHES DOWN -- has just returned from
Evanora’s -- he hands Theodora a rolled parchment -- Theodora
unwraps and reads it, tells the two Monkeys --

THEODORA
My sister wants me to be sure this
Wizard's a real Wizard.
(thinks a moment, then)
Fetch me a rabbit.

BACK AT THE CAMPFIRE -- Oz berates his hound-dog self --

OZ
Innocent girl like that? You
oughta be ashamed of yourself.

BACK TO THEODORA -- as Nikko brings her back a fluffy tan-
colored little bunny.

THEODORA
Set it down.

Nikko obeys. Kala returns -- watches from a distance, as...
Theodora stares fixedly at the bunny -- the bunny quivering
with fear -- then Theodora smiles, does something with her
hands and, just like that:

THE LITTLE BUNNY TRANSFORMS INTO A FULL-GROWN LION. The
Monkeys shrink back -- ready to fly away if need be.

 

THEODORA
(to the Lion)
Listen close, then do as I say.
25.

EXT. BACK AT THE CAMPFIRE

Oz is poking at the fire with a stick, when he hears: A
rustling in the woods. He peers into the darkness.

OZ
Theodora? That you?

No response. But then he hears: A low, guttural growl.
And, very slowly, Oz pulls a tree branch from the fire, the
end of which is burning like a torch. He calls out again --

OZ
Theodora?

AND WITH AN EARTHSHAKING ROAR THE LION ATTACKS! -- comes
CHARGING out of the darkness, MAKES A MURDEROUS LEAP AT OZ --

 

OZ HITS THE DECK -- THE LION GOES SAILING OVER HIM -- Oz
quickly body-rolls to his satchel -- desperately tries to
open it with one hand, the other waving that burning branch
at the Lion -- and we see:

THEODORA -- IN THE TREES -- keeping to the shadows -- moving
to get a better ringside view, as --

THE LION CIRCLES... Oz, on one knee, gets the satchel open --
shakes the burning branch at the beast --

OZ
Stay back! I’m warning you!
(his other hand fumbling
inside the satchel)

C'mon -- c’mon -- where is it?
THE LION ROARS -- then charges Oz again! -- and Oz, still

kneeling, whips his arm out of the satchel, brings it up and:

BANG! He SHOOTS the leaping Lion with that Derringer of his!
The Lion YOWLS in pain, then TURNS TAIL AND FLEES INTO THE
FOREST -- whimpering -- and --

 

OZ
That’s right! Run! Run, you
coward! And don’t come back!
(checks the gun, mutters
to himself --)
‘Cause I’m fresh out of bullets.

 

And thus the Cowardly Lion was born -- perhaps -- and --

THEODORA -- STILL IN THE TREES -- smiles, says --
26.

THEODORA
Satisfied, Sister?

-- like she knows Evanora can hear her, even though Evanora’s
miles away... she then gestures Nikko over, pens another
quick note to her sister -- Nikko flies off with it and --

BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Oz turns as Theodora comes dashing
out of the woods -- she runs to him, all a-flutter --

THEODORA
What happened! I heard this
roaring, then a bang!

OZ

It was nothing. I just...

(wipes sweat off his face)
I just fended off a large
carnivorous, uh, carnivore -- no
big deal -- back where I come from
we do that practically every day...

(he sees his hand is

shaking like a leaf)
Decorum alone prevented me from
tussling with the beast bare-handed
-- so I just gave him a little
taste of this --

(shows her the gun)
And he went scampering off like a
scared little rabbit.

THEODORA
What an odd-looking wand.

OZ
Wand? Oh, right, yes, well -- it
certainly worked its magic tonight,
didn’t it? And don’t worry -- I
made sure he didn’t hurt Mozart.

He hands her the Music Box -- and she’s quite touched.

THEODORA
Thank you, Wizard.

Their eyes connect again, and --

THEODORA
We should get some sleep. We still
have a long way to go tomorrow.
27.

EXT. ON THE CAMPFIRE - LATER THAT NIGHT

And we see: Oz is asleep -- Kala’s asleep -- Theodora’s
awake -- holding the Music Box -- staring at it...

 

EXT. FURTHER ALONG THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD - FOLLOWING MORNING

Oz, Theodora and Kala come out of the forest -- into brown-
hued Central Oz -- then Oz abruptly stops, seeing...

EMERALD CITY: IN THE DISTANCE

A spectacular soaring skyline -- Sleeping Beauty’s Castle on
steroids -- and Oz is appropriately awed.
OZ
The Emerald City... I’ve seen it
before, you know.
THEODORA
You have?
OZ
In my wildest dreams. Come on!
-- quickening the pace -- he can’t wait to get there -- and
Theodora laughs -- his enthusiasm’s infectious, and --

EXT. CLOSER TO EMERALD CITY - STILL ON THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD

They pass through a LARGE FIELD STREWN WITH BOULDERS... THEN
THE BOULDERS START TO MOVE... and it quickly becomes apparent
that the rocks are really turtle-shell-shaped concave
shields, under which have been hiding:

A BATTALION OF GNOMES -- short, squat, fierce-looking
warriors with skin the color and texture of stone and beards
so long they tie them around their waists -- and they’re all

armed to the teeth: Broadswords, cutlasses, battle-axes...
0Z goes still, then sees, even worse --

ON THE SURROUNDING HILLSIDES: MORE SAVAGE WARRIORS -- a mix
of GROWLEYWOGS -- silent, half-clad, eight-foot-tall
Aboriginals armed with knives and bows and arrows and spears
-- and WHIMSIES -- who are distinguished by their
extraordinarily broad shoulders and the enormous crazy-
colored papier-mache MARDI GRAS MASKS they wear on their
amazingly-undersized heads.

 

 
28.

OZ
Get behind me.

THEODORA
Don’t hurt them. They’re here to
escort us to my sister.

OZ
(hiding immense relief)
They are? Then lucky for them you
stayed my hand -- I was about to
smite the lot of them!

The Savage Horde forms a protective cordon around them,
starts marching them towards the city, chanting:

SAVAGE HORDE
Oh-we-oh, yo ho! Oh-we-oh, yo-ho!

Then we hear: A FANFARE OF TRUMPETS -- and jump to:

EXT. EMERALD CITY - DAY

As the jewel-studded gates swing open to reveal: Sheer

magnificence -- towering towers, soaring spires, flowers,
fountains -- everything glittering and gleaming -- a MARCHING

BAND files in and leads Oz and Theodora into the city, into:

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - EMERALD CITY

BELLS are RINGING -- young girls strew rose petals in their
path -- all the sidewalks and balconies are lined with WILDLY
CHEERING CROWDS -- a hodgepodge of Oz inhabitants from all
four corners of the Kingdom: WINKIES from the West,
MUNCHKINS from the East, GILLIKINS from the North and
QUADLINGS from the South -- all dressed in different regional
colors and all enthusiastically waving and fluttering green-
and-white flags and pennants, and --

0Z is eating this up -- waving to the throng like he’s a
returning war hero or a campaigning politician -- laughing --

OZ
What, no fireworks?

THEODORA
What are fireworks?

They pass through the ARCH OF TRIUMPH -- heading towards the
Emerald Palace -- and what Oz isn’t seeing is:
29.

BEHIND THE SCENES -- EVANORA’S PALACE GUARD -- uniformed
bully-boys passing out the flags and banners, and they’re
making damned sure the Citizens of Em City are cheering 0z’s
entrance with sufficient gusto -- or else... giving us a
sense that things might not be quite what they seem here in

the Merry Old Land of Oz...

 

EXT. THE PALACE

Grand -- glorious -- Theodora leads Oz inside.

INT. THE GRAND ENTRANCE HALL OF THE PALACE

THE JOINT CHIEFS OF THE SAVAGE ARMY nod deferentially to
Theodora as she leads Oz through the enormous double doors at
the other end of the hall, into:

INT. AN INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR

Seems to stretch on forever -- and at the end there’s another
set of tall double doors which open all by themselves, into:
INT. THE THRONE ROOM

And there she is, seated majestically on the EMERALD THRONE:
EVANORA -- THE QUEEN OF OZ. She’s also the Witch of the
East. She’s older than Theodora, but no less attractive. A

very powerful presence -- with a penetrating gaze.

THEODORA
Wizard, my sister Evanora.

Oz nods to her. Evanora sounds curious, almost amused --

EVANORA
You do not kneel.
OZ
No, ma’am, I do not.
EVANORA
But I am Queen.
OZ
And I’m an American -- and

Americans kneel to no one.

A beat -- then Evanora smiles -- practically purrs --
30.

EVANORA
Oh, Sister, I like him already.
(back to Oz)
An American, you say -- I’m not

familiar with the word. You’re
also a Wizard, I’m told.

 

OZ
Not just a Wizard -- the Wizard
you've all been waiting for --

here, in the flesh, and at Your
Majesty’s service.

Another Evanora smile, then --

EVANORA
You've had a long journey, I’m sure
you'd like a bath and a bed. These
girls will show you to your room.

She waves a hand -- TWO MUNCHKIN MAIDS waddle up to Oz.

EVANORA
We'll speak some more at dinner.

OZ
I'm looking forward to it.

Each girl takes a hand and they lead Oz away -- Kala toddling
after them toting 0z’s satchel. Evanora waits until they’re
gone, then turns to her sister.

EVANORA
You're certain, then, that he’s a
Wizard?

THEODORA

You saw what he could do.

EVANORA
Yes, I did see. I saw it all.

-- gesturing towards: her CRYSTAL BALL -- then --

EVANORA
I saw then what I see now...
(a big Big Sister’s smile)
You like him, don’t you?... and you
want him to like you...

 

Theodora -- almost blushing -- can’t meet her sister’s eyes --
as Evanora comes up close to her -- circling...
EVANORA

And who can blame you? You’re
still so young... and you still
have feelings, don’t you?
Stirrings and... yearnings...

(mysterious smile)
You did the right thing, dear,
bringing him here...

INT. OZ’S CHAMBERS - SAME

31.

The Munchkin Maids curtsey their way out the door -- 0z looks

around the room, which is sumptuous as sin --

OZ

Not bad... not bad at all.

(then, to Kala)
Y'know something, Monkey? Just
between you, me and these four
walls? Methinks yours truly has
finally hit the Mother Lode, landed
feet first in the Pot at the End of
the Rainbow, smelling like a rose.

(grins)
And if you don’t think I’m gonna
take full advantage, you don’t know
Mr. Oscar Diggs -- otherwise known
as... The Wizard You’ve All Been
Waiting For -- The One and Only
Wizard of Oz!

Kala frowns -- Oz bursts out laughing, and we go --

INT. GRAND DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Oz and the Sisters are the only ones sitting at a long oaken
table which could easily seat fifty. Oz finishes what has

been a real belly-buster of a meal.

OZ
A royal repast fit for a King, if I
do say so myself.

EVANORA

(smiles, then)
Sister? Leave us, won’t you? I'd
like to speak to the Wizard alone.

Theodora gives Oz a quick smile -- and leaves the room.

watches her go -- then Evanora stands, says:

Oz
32.

EVANORA
Walk with me.
Oz graciously offers her his arm -- she takes it and the two
stroll out to --

INT. THE INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR

EVANORA

My sister’s very pretty, isn’t she?
OZ

Yes. She is.
EVANORA

And she speaks most highly of you.
OZ

Does she.
EVANORA

It seems you made quite the
impression. She says you just...
fell from the sky...

OZ
I do like to make an entrance.

EVANORA
Yes -- but why here, of all places?
Why did you come to 0z?

Oz shrugs -- obliquely -- maintaining the mystery --

OZ
Could’ve been happenstance...
could've been serendipity... or
maybe it was Destiny... could've
been Fate.

EVANORA
Whatever it was, I’m glad you’re
here. Come, I want to show you
something.

INT. OUTSIDE THE ROOM OF RESPLENDENCE

Two Savage Guards are on either side of an Archway -- and the
interior of the arch is A CURTAIN OF BURNING FIRE.
33.

Evanora gestures to the Guards: Begone -- they move off --
then Evanora gives a little wave of her hand and the Curtain
of Fire goes out, revealing a STOUT WOODEN DOOR -- with iron
bands and multiple locks. Another wave of Evanora’s hand and
the locks fly open, the door swings open by itself, and
Evanora ushers Oz into:

INT. THE ROOM OF RESPLENDENCE

The Royal Repository of THE CROWN JEWELS OF OZ -- gemstones
and jewels everywhere you look -- thousands of them,
sparkling with the brilliance of a million suns... and Oz is
gaping -- while trying to sound blase.

OZ

This is, uh, quite the little piggy
bank you've got here, Highness.

EVANORA
You like it? Theodora told me how
much you seem to enjoy bright and
shiny things.

There's a TREASURE CHEST filled with GLEAMING GOLD COINS. 0z
runs his fingers through them like water -- then PALMS one of

the coins, disappears it up his sleeve as he moves on and
picks up an Emerald the size of an Ostrich Egg.

OZ
Y'know, with this stone alone, I
could buy the state of Kansas --
and probably half of Nebraska along

with it.
EVANORA
It’s yours if you want...
Oz stops -- what? -- and Evanora smiles, says --
EVANORA

Along with this...

And she holds up: THE DIAMOND DAGGER -- which has a 6-inch
blade of razor-sharp steel, a cross guard of filigreed gold,
and a hilt that’s totally ENCRUSTED WITH GLITTERING DIAMONDS.

EVANORA
And all you've got to do is... kill
the Wicked Witches.

OZ
Witches? Plural? You mean there’s
more than one?
34.

EVANORA

Don’t tell me you didn’t know.
OZ

About --?
EVANORA

My dear sister.

OZ
Your sister --?

EVANORA
I know why she brought you here.

OZ
She brought me here to help you.

EVANORA
She brought you here to kill me.

OZ
Kill you? No. With all due
respect, Highness, you've got it
all wrong --

EVANORA

What did she promise you? That the
two of you would share my Throne
and Crown? Tell me you weren’t
foolish enough to believe it.

(steps close, hisses)
But you can believe this: After
she seduced you into killing me
she'd have eaten you like a spider.
So take this...

She grabs his hand, presses the Diamond Dagger to his palm.

EVANORA
... And prove to me you’re the
Wizard you say you are -- the

Wizard we’ve all been waiting for.
She steps back -- and STARTS TO DEMATERIALIZE.

EVANORA
Kill my sister, then together you
and I will defeat the Witch of the
South once and for all.
(vanishing)
Kill my sister, Wizard -- and
you'll be King.
35.

She's gone -- disappeared into thin air -- and Oz just stands
there -- staring -- trying to process... then looks down at
the Dagger in his hand -- then, abruptly, he jams it in the
back of his belt and goes tearing out of there --

INT. THE INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR

Sprinting -- no time to waste -- then up some stone stairs --

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBERS
Oz running -- shouting --

OZ
Theodora! Theodora, where are you!

After a moment, a door slowly opens -- Theodora looks out --
with a faint, expectant smile --

THEODORA
Wizard? What is it?

-- like she’s both scared and thrilled to find him here --
ready for whatever he’s got in mind, but --

 

 

OZ
We've got to get you out of here!

Behind her we see a SHADOW swiftly sliding along the wall.

THEODORA
Why? What --?

Then: Shazam! That Shadow becomes Evanora -- who with a
quick angry flick of her hand sends 0Z FLYING THROUGH THE AIR
-- magically -- telekinetically -- bashing him up against the
far wall -- as Theodora wheels on her sister --

THEODORA
What are you doing!

EVANORA
Saving your silly life! He came
here to kill you!

OZ
Theodora, no, don’t listen to her!

Another flick of her hand and now Oz is GAGGING -- CHOKING --
can't talk, can’t breathe -- as Evanora says to her sister --
36.

EVANORA
You don’t believe me?

Another flick of her hand sends Oz SLAMMING AGAINST THE
CEILING -- then she BOUNCES him off the marble floor,
flipping him upside down, and as he does --

THE DIAMOND DAGGER, jarred loose, falls from his belt, hits
the ground at Theodora’s feet. Theodora stares.

EVANORA
Out of nowhere he suddenly appears
-- you think that was an accident?
No! She sent him here -- sent him
here to destroy us!

THEODORA
No, I don’t believe that -- I --

EVANORA
Unless, of course, it wasn’t she
who sent him...

One final flick of the hand and Oz is RAMMED HEAD-FIRST into

the far wall again -- knocking him cold.
EVANORA

Perhaps it was someone else...
(moves threateningly near)
Tomorrow I’1ll know... tomorrow your
Wizard and I are going to have a

little talk...

And we can tell from Theodora’s expression that ‘A little
talk’ means something absolutely horrible.

EVANORA
Tomorrow I‘’1ll learn the truth...
and believe me, Sister...
(strokes Theodora’s hair)
I do so hope I find out you were
nothing more than naive...

Theodora reddens like she’d been slapped. Evanora SNAPS HER
FINGERS -- a few SAVAGE GUARDSMEN appear.

EVANORA
Take him downstairs.
INT. DUNGEON - 0Z'S CELL - NIGHT

Oz slowly wakens -- finds he’s CHAINED TO A STONE WALL.
37.

GNOME GUARD (0.S.)
Look who's back amongst the living.

TWO SAVAGE GUARDS -- a GNOME and a WHIMSIE -- taunt Oz
through the small barred grille of the thick cell door.

GNOME GUARD
The Great and Powerful Wizard
himself. How about showing us a
little magic, Wizard?

WHIMSIE GUARD
Yeah, let’s see you get out of them
locks and chains --

GNOME GUARD
Perhaps he wants what the Queen’s
got in store for him.

OZ
(trying not to show fear)
What’s she going to do, turn me
into a newt?

GNOME GUARD
Oh, no. No, nothing like that.
(beat)
Torture, more like.

WHIMSIE GUARD
The Queen’s got a real taste for

it. So do I. Slow roasting’s my
favorite.

GNOME GUARD
I like a good flaying myself.
Flesh makes such a fine meal
afterwards.

-- slurping like he’s sucking down a strand of fettucine as --

OZ
So what’s with the beard?

GNOME GUARD
My beard?

OZ
They don’t have barbers around
here? A family of rats could be
living in there and you’d never
know it.
38.

GNOME GUARD
Maybe so, but this here is my pride
and joy, the source of my vast
potency and strength.

WHIMSIE GUARD
Or so those ignorant creatures
believe. You want to beat a Gnome
in battle, just have a whack at
that beard of his and he’1ll go
hieing home to his mommy quick as
you please.

GNOME GUARD

And if you want to defeat a Whimsie
all you've got to do is knock that
great silly contraption off his
shoulders and that’s the last
you'll see of him I assure you!

(stage-whispers to Oz)
They can’t bear to be seen without
their masks, on account of their
woefully-wee heads -- no bigger
than a Munchkin’s fist.

-- miming the approximate size -- as Oz mutters to himself --

OZ
Good to know.
(then, to them)
And not that this hasn’t been
fascinating, fellas, but I wonder
if you could do me a favor and just
leave me alone.

GNOME GUARD
He wants us to leave him alone.

WHIMSIE GUARD
The man does need his rest.

GNOME GUARD
Aye, all that wailing and screaming
he’s gonna be doing tomorrow can be
very taxing on an individual.

The Savages share a laugh, move from the door, and Oz starts
contorting himself -- tries working his way free of the locks

 

and chains, while --
39.

INT. THEODORA’S ROOM - INSIDE THE PALACE

THEODORA -- AT THE WINDOW -- staring out at the night -- Kala
sitting in a corner, watching her -- as Theodora frowns, then
looks over at:

THE MUSIC BOX -- ON THE VANITY ... she walks to it, winds it
up -- Mozart fills the room -- the music touching whatever's
left of her Witch’s heart... then: quickly, abruptly, before
she has a chance to change her mind -- she grabs a quill,
scribbles a note, bids Kala --

THEODORA
Come here.

She hands him the ROLLED-PARCHMENT NOTE and a KEY.

THEODORA
Bring this to the Wizard -- and let
no one else see it. Go.

INT. DUNGEON - OUTSIDE 0Z'S CELL
The Savage Guards start hearing VOICES FROM INSIDE THE CELL.

VARIOUS VOICES
I'll take the pinhead... I’1l take
the hairy one... and I'll get the
door... don’t worry, Wizard, we’ll
have you out of here in no time.

The Voices are Oz’s, of course -- but the Guards don’t know
that, and simultaneously lunge to the cell door and see:

 

IN THE CELL: Nothing. And no one -- no sign of Oz -- just
those now-empty chains against the wall. The Guards fumble
for their keys -- then yank the door open -- rush inside,
weapons drawn -- still see bupkis, then --

Oz drops down behind them from his hand-hold above the door,
snatches the Gnome’s key ring, then quick as a flash he’s out
the door, slams it shut behind him, and --

OZ
Fare thee well, boys! -- don’t
forget to write -- and you can tell

that Queen of yours I hope someday
a house falls on her head!

And he’s gone -- running --
40.

THROUGH THE DUNGEON’S DARK STONE CORRIDORS

Torch-lit shadow -- scurrying rats -- a locked iron door --
Oz tries one key -- then another -- finally heaves it open
only to come face-to-face with:

KALA -- who’s so startled he drops THEODORA’S NOTE -- and he

freezes -- Oz freezes -- everything hanging in the balance --
what’s the Monkey going to do? -- then:
KALA

Goodness gracious me! We’ve got to
get you out of here!

OZ
You... you can talk?

KALA
No time for dilly-dally! We must
go -- Glinda, she will help us!

OZ

Glinda?
KALA

The Witch of the South.
OZ

(confused)

But... isn’t she the Wicked Witch?
KALA

No-no -- Glinda, she is the Good

Witch -- the Sisters are the Wicked
Ones. Please, I'll explain as we
run -- now hurry -- this way --
come-come !

EXT. OUTSIDE EMERALD CITY - NIGHT

Oz and Kala make their swift, silent getaway, and soon --

INT. THRONE ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

The Savage Guards are being grilled by Evanora -- surrounded
by Savage Generals -- Theodora at her sister's side.

GNOME GUARD
«+. Strike me blind if I’m lying --
he just disappeared like smoke.
41.

WHIMSIE GUARD
Cold smoke. Did you feel the cold?

GNOME GUARD
I did. Like the very breath of
death it was...

A GROWLEYWOG GUARD comes in... hands Evanora a ROLLED-UP
PARCHMENT -- and Theodora’s eyes widen, because she knows:
it’s the note she wrote to Oz... and as Evanora scans it --

GNOME GUARD
I’m telling you, Highness, he’s a
Great and Powerful Wizard, that one
is, believe me.

Evanora looks up from the note -- gazes at Theodora -- then
sighs, gives a weary wave of her hand and says --

EVANORA
Take them away, and kill them.

The hapless Guards are dragged off. Evanora then turns to
her Generals.

EVANORA
Well, what are you waiting for?
You find this Wizard and you bring
him to me -- ALIVE! -- and whatever
you do, do NOT let him reach the
Witch of the South! Now GO!

 

The Savages skedaddle -- and when the Sisters are alone...
EVANORA
You wound me, Sister -- you really

do. What am I to make of this?
(reads the note aloud)

‘I’m sorry -- I never should have

brought you here -- don’t worry I

will help you.’

She lets the parchment flutter from her fingers to the floor.

EVANORA
Did you help him?

THEODORA
No, Sister.

EVANORA
I do so want to believe that.
42.

THEODORA
You can -- you should --

EVANORA
But how? How can I believe you,
when you do this to me! You know
what will happen, should this
Wizard get away! He will ally
himself with her --

THEODORA
You don’t know that for sure.

EVANORA
But I do. Her charms are much,
much greater than yours...
(lets that needle sink in)
«+. Or mine. Just you wait --
you'll see.

EXT. EMERALD CITY - MOMENTS LATER

THE SAVAGE HORDE ARMY STORMS OUT THE CITY GATES -- hundreds
of them -- armed to the teeth -- a loping, quick-march pace --
A CADRE OF WINGED MONKEYS flying in formation above them...
EXT. ROCKY TOR - NIGHT

0Z AND KALA -- scrambling up the mountain -- and as they near
the top, Kala glances back -- then points -- Oz looks, sees:

THE TORCH-LIT SAVAGE ARMY on the dark plains below -- the
Winged Monkeys flying in formation above them, streaking
towards us, closing in fast...

KALA
Do something!
OZ
Like what?
KALA
I don’t know -- you're the Wizard!
OZ
Yeah, well, sorry -- I’m fresh out

of miracles at the moment.

Kala studies him a beat -- then starts chugging up the hill.
KALA
Then come-come -- keep moving --
Glinda, she will help us.

OZ
Good -- where is she?

KALA
Far from here.

OZ
Then how --?

KALA
She just will.

43.

They crest the mountain, and as they run and slide down the

far side, we pull up and back and see...

THE IMPENETRABLE MIST

A thick, spectral fog sweeping in from the south -- moving
across the land like an immense ghostly hand... it envelops
Oz and Kala... then the mountain... and soon the Savage Horde
and the Winged Monkeys are engulfed in an Ocean of Cloud...

WITH OZ AND KALA -- IN THE IMPENETRABLE MIST

Eerie, dreamlike -- Oz can’t see a thing.
OZ
Where are you?
KALA
Here, Wizard.
Oz moves towards the sound -- finds Kala --
OZ

Glinda did this?

KALA
Oh yes -- yes-yes -- I told you,
she's a very good Witch.

Then we see: A glow. Kala’s holding in his paw:
IRIDESCENT ORB -- the Orb’s a Magic Compass.

KALA
Take my tail. Follow me.
44,

EXT. WITH THE SAVAGE HORDE ARMY -- IN THE IMPENETRABLE MIST

Fog-blind, floundering, disoriented. THREE GENERALS are
clustered together -- a GNOME, a WHIMSIE, and a GROWLEYWOG.

WHIMSIE GENERAL
It’s no use. We’ll never find him
in this.

GNOME GENERAL
The Queen won’t be happy.

WHIMSIE GENERAL
Is she ever? Nothing we can do.
(then)
You think he did this?

GNOME GENERAL
They say he came from the clouds --

now here we are in one -- I’m sure
such a thing’d be easy for a Wizard
like him.

The other two Generals nod, seem to agree...

EXT. WITH OZ AND KALA -- MOVING THROUGH THE IMPENETRABLE MIST

Illuminated by the Orb. As he walks, Oz plays with that GOLD
COIN he pilfered, deftly rolling it through his fingers.

OZ
So: you have a name?

KALA
My name? My name is Kala.

OZ
Pleased to meet you, Kala.
He sticks his hand out -- and Kala hesitates -- no man’s ever
wanted to shake his paw before -- and, as they do so --
OZ

I’m in your debt.

KALA
Don’t thanky-thank me yet, not till
we make it safe to Glinda.

OZ
And you're telling me she’s a Good
Witch?
45.

KALA
Oh yes -- yes-yes -- a very Good
Witch -- the only Good Witch left!

OZ
And Theodora...?

KALA
Quite wicked, but not all the way
wicked yet, not like her sister --
no -- but soon, I think, soon-soon!

OZ
(after a moment, quietly)
She had me fooled, you know. They

both did.
Kala laughs -- a real ooh-ooh-ah-ah Monkey Laugh.
KALA
Yes, yes, I know! But don’t feel
bad, Wizard -- you’re not the first
man-man to be blinded by a pretty
face and pretty promises -- lots of

men-men just as foolish as you!

OZ
Thanks -- I guess.
(then)
Tell me something: The other
Monkeys -- can they talk too?
KALA

No-no, only me. Thanks to Glinda.
OZ
Theodora didn’t know, did she?
That you could talk -- or that you
were Glinda’s spy.
Kala doesn’t have to answer, because --

KALA
Look-look -- here they are.

And Oz turns and sees, in front of them:

THE MIST MAIDENS -- beautiful, ghostly female apparitions --

they seem to be made of fog -- with flowing hair, flowing
robes, flowing arms of white -- beckoning them forward...
KALA

They’1l guide us the rest of the
way -- come-come.
46.

Oz hesitates, then follows, the Maidens soon envelop them...

EXT. EMERALD CITY - FOLLOWING MORNING
The fog is gone -- it’s a sunny day.

EVANORA (0.S.)
So he got away...

INT. THRONE ROOM - CLOSE ON EVANORA

The Savage Generals have reported back. Evanora -- toying
with the Diamond Dagger -- glances pointedly at Theodora.
EVANORA
.-. heading South -- straight to

Glinda, I suppose.
(to the Generals)
Leave us.

The Generals troop out. The Sisters are alone.

EVANORA
You see now I’m right -- either
your Wizard and fair Glinda have
been together from the start -- or
they soon shall be. Which means,
my pretty, that soon you must
choose... between Glinda and me.

THEODORA
You're my Sister. How can you even
think I’d choose Glinda over you?

EVANORA

Because there’s still a part of you
that still wants to be like Glinda:
Beautiful... and beloved... rather
than hated and feared, like me.

(strokes Theodora’s hair)
But that is not who you are, dear --
not who you are meant to be... I
need you, Sister -- and halfway
isn’t far enough. Join me... and
together we'll defeat them -- join
me, and together we shall rule for
the next thousand years!

(kisses Theodora’s cheek)
And all it will cost you is your
heart.

 

Off Theodora’s look we bleed into a...
47.

MONTAGE: THE RUMOR MILL OF OZ

Word of Oz’s escape spreads throughout the land. We see
VARIOUS CITIZENS in VARIOUS PLACES, talking on the sly.

VARIOUS CITIZENS
(like a song)
Did you hear? The Wizard escaped --
he got away -- he walked through
walls -- he disappeared -- he’s
eight feet tall -- did you hear?

EXT. OZ AND KALA —- ON THE ROAD SOUTH - MORNING

Oz stops, hands on hips, peering off.

OZ
What’s that I’m looking at?

KALA
That? That is Quadling Country,
just on the other side.

OZ
But on the other side of what?

The reason he’s asking: Everything for the next half-mile or
so looks regular and normal, clear as a bell. Beyond that,
though, is what appears to be:

A SHIMMERING WALL -- extending east to west as far as Oz can

see -- everything beyond it hazy as a mirage. Oz and Kala
approach... Oz tentatively touches the Wall... can’t push
through it -- it’s a force-field of some kind.

OZ

Glinda’s work as well, I take it.
How do we get through?

KALA
How do I know? I’m just a Monkey.
You're a Wizard, you do something.
Oz fumbles for a response -- and Kala laughs.

KALA
Kala just kidding!

And he smiles, raises up the Orb -- which suddenly LAUNCHES

 

itself off his palm, shoots off into the Wall -- and when Orb
and Wall meet a sparkling PORTAL appears... Kala gestures:
Let’s go -- and the two pass through. The Wall closes behind

them. And now they’re in:
48.

EXT. QUADLING COUNTRY
And 0z looks back at the Wall and marvels.

OZ
Y'know, back where I come from a
man can get pretty fizzled on the
same old usual. But around here,
even the commonplace is really
quite extraordinary, isn’t it?

KALA

Wizard, I leave you now.

(off Oz’s surprise)
I must speak to Glinda. You just
take-take this road here -- bring
you straight to Glinda’s Castle.
You'll be alright. Just be careful
when you cross the Ripple Land.

And off he flies -- Oz shouting after him --

OZ
What’s the Ripple Land?

Kala doesn’t answer, doesn’t even look back. Oz shrugs,
starts walking. And soon he’s right smack in the middle of:

EXT. THE RIPPLE LAND

Which is, as Baum describes it: ‘A succession of hills and
valleys, all very steep and rocky, and they changed places
constantly by rippling. While [0z] was climbing a hill it
sank down under him and became a valley, and while he was
descending into a valley it rose up and carried him to the
top of a hill. This was very perplexing to the traveler.’

And so it is for Oz -- and at first he has a hell of a time
navigating his way across -- but eventually he makes it back
to solid ground again -- and before long he finds himself in:

EXT. DAINTY CHINA COUNTRY

And as he walks he notices his shoes are making a chinking
sound -- so he stops, raps that Gold Coin against the ground.

OZ
Sounds like... fine china.
49.

He looks around, and sees: Everything around him seems to be
made of fine china -- the land, the trees, the farms, the
horses and pigs and cows -- they’re all as smooth and shiny
as painted porcelain. Then he sees, near one of the barns:

A DAINTY CHINA GIRL -- teetering along the top of a fence
dividing a Dainty China Chicken Coop from a Dainty China Pig
Sty. The Girl looks up -- Oz gives her a jaunty wave --

And, startled, the Girl loses her balance and tumbles into
the pig sty just like Dorothy did in The Movie -- the China

 

 

Pigs start squealing -- Oz comes running --
OZ
Sweet Jumpin’ Jiminy -- are you
alright!

-- then he sees: THE CHINA GIRL’S LEG HAS SNAPPED CLEAN OFF.
She sounds remarkably calm, albeit a bit perturbed.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
Could you help me up, please?

He lifts her up out of the sty.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
Now my leg?

He reaches over the fence, hands her her leg.

OZ
Is there someone I should call? A
doctor, or --?

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
No, my mother has some glue inside.

OZ
I’m sorry -- I didn’t mean to
startle you, I --

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
You're that Wizard they’ve been
talking about, aren’t you?

OZ
Afraid so.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
You don’t look much like a Wizard
to me.

OZ
What should a Wizard look like?
50.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
Don’t know -- I’ve never seen one
before.
(beat)
Thought you’d be bigger.

She starts hobbling towards the house, using her detached leg
as a cane, then looks back.

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
You will help us, won't you?

OZ
Um, sure I will. Sure. And you're
sure you're alright?

DAINTY CHINA GIRL
I'm fine, thank you.

She's gone -- and Oz remarks to himself --

OZ
Fine, she says. Her leg snapped
clean off her body but she’s fine.
(then, to the China Pigs)
Y'know, I’m about this close to
losing my capacity for surprise?

The China Pigs don’t care. Then one of the China Chickens
plops out a DAINTY CHINA EGG. Oz reaches over the fence,
picks it up, flicks it with a finger: Fine china.

OZ
Simply extraordinary.

He sticks the China Egg in his pocket, walks on, while --

INT. THEODORA’S ROOM - EMERALD CITY - SAME

Theodora winds the Music Box... starts DANCING to the
music... eyes closed... alone... remembering... then she
startles, seeing: Evanora’s come into the room.

EVANORA
Just thought you should know: Your
Wizard is now in Quadling Country.
(heads back out)
Where, no doubt, he’ll soon be
dancing with fair Glinda.

She’s gone -- Theodora’s cheeks scald red.
51.

EXT. THE HAMMERHEAD HILLS

Oz approaches a narrow mountain pass -- whistling to himself,
rolling that Gold Coin through his fingers -- then he hears:

HAMMERHEAD (0.S.)
Stop right there.

Seeing: THE HAMMERHEADS -- three very short, squat, surly-
looking characters with flat-topped heads and no arms --
blocking the road in front of him. One snarls:

 

HAMMERHEAD
Who are you?

OZ
Name’s Oz.

HAMMERHEAD

Sure it is --

HAMMERHEAD #2
I’m sure.

HAMMERHEAD
Listen, you, just ‘cause our heads
are flat doesn’t mean they’re
empty, so if you’ve got any brains
in that noggin of yours you’1l turn
right around and go back the way
you came! No one comes through
here without our say-so --

HAMMERHEAD #3
And to you we don’t say so, to you
we say no --

HAMMERHEAD #2
So be gone and don’t delay!

OZ
(sighs)
Look, fellas, much as I’d like to
be neighborly and obliging, I've
come a long way and I really don’t
have time for this.
52.

And as he starts to push past them: Hammerhead #1’s head
suddenly SHOOTS out from his body -- neck stretched like a

 

 

 

Jack-in-the-Box -- and the flat part of his skull slams into
Oz’'s gut -- knocks him flying into the air -- the Second
Hammerhead deftly catches Oz on the flat of his head like a
soccer pro -- then he boings him into the air again --
Hammerhead #3’s turn next -- and the Hammerheads continue to

volleyball Oz back and forth like a human beanbag for a while
-- and all Oz can do is oof and ouch until:

KALA (0.S.)
You, boys, you stop it!

KALA swoops in for a landing.

KALA
You cease these shenanigans!
Glinda, she’s waiting for this man!

The Hammerheads stop -- Oz hits the ground with a thud -- the
Hammerheads scowl, collectively --

HAMMERHEAD
What’s Glinda want with him?

KALA
Him, he is the Wizard!

And the Hammerheads’ jaws drop.

HAMMERHEAD
You're the Wizard? Why didn’t you
say so? We’ve been waiting an
awfully long time for you, y’know.

OZ
You have? Why?

HAMMERHEAD #3
So you could get us our arms back.

HAMMERHEAD
The Wicked Witch of the East, she
took ‘em away -- and as long as she
sits on the Emerald Throne we'll be

like this --

HAMMERHEAD #2
Can’t even pick our noses.

They all scowl again and nod. Oz says, falteringly --
53.

OZ
Okay, so... I'll speak to Glinda,
see what I can do.

HAMMERHEAD
We’re counting on you, Wizard!

OZ
You and everyone else, it seems.

-- and he sounds burdened by that -- then, to Kala:

OZ
To Glinda’s, then.

Off they go -- and soon, they come to it at last...
EXT. GLINDA'S CASTLE
White, radiant, glorious -- seems to be made of living

crystal. Oz is dazzled -- Kala leads him inside.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD

Like the Gardens of Babylon -- but not a person to be seen.
OZ
Where is everybody?
KALA
Don’t know, who were you expecting?
OZ
Guards, servants, courtiers -- this

is a castle, isn’t it?

KALA
Glinda, she is a Witch -- anda
Witch-witch needs no one.

OZ
Independent-minded, is she? I like
that in a woman.

KALA
(stops, turns)
But I’m telling you she’s not a
woman -- she’s a Witch.

OZ
How ‘bout you let me be the judge
of that?
54.

-- with a wolfish grin -- and Kala rolls his eyes -- they
continue into the castle -- and in moments we arrive in:

INT. GLINDA’S PRIVATE CHAMBER

Very long, very high, many-windowed -- French doors leading
out to a balcony -- and, as with the rest of the castle,
there’s no one to be seen.

OZ
You gonna let her know we’re here?
KALA
No need!
And he points -- through the open French doors -- and 0z
looks and sees, in the distance, coming towards us --
A MAGIC BUBBLE... looks like a big opalescent bubble of soap.
Oz glances at Kala -- Kala just grins -- and the Bubble keeps
wafting towards us, settles down onto the balcony -- the

Bubble vanishes, and there she is...
GLINDA

And she is, in the words of Joseph Campbell: “The paragon of
all paragons of beauty, the reply to all desire... the
incarnation of the promise of perfection.” She steps into
the room -- has the bearing of a Pirate Queen.

 

 

GLINDA
So. You're the Wizard everyone's
talking about. I’m Glinda.

And Oz just shakes his head -- sounds absolutely awestruck --
OZ
No... I know who you are: You’re

Venus and Aphrodite, Ishtar and
Isis, you’re Helen and Cleopatra,
Ophelia and Juliet. You are the
reason men write poetry. You are
why men fight wars.

And Glinda smiles -- dryly --

GLINDA
Yes, Kala told me how fond you were
of words. He also said he wasn’t
sure if you really are a Wizard.

OZ
He did, did he?
55.

-- scowling at Kala, who nods enthusiastically --

GLINDA
So, then -- are you?

OZ
A Wizard? Guess that all depends
on how you define the term. Can I
turn water into wine, dross into
gold? No. Nor can I make
mountains tremble or part the Seven
Seas. However...

He reaches towards Kala -- seems to pluck that Dainty China
Egg right out of the Monkey's ear.

OZ
I can at times Astound and Amaze.
(makes the Egg disappear)
Illusion’s my game.

GLINDA
Illusion as in: Not real.

OZ
Madame, you cut me to the quick.

GLINDA
Evanora, I understand, wanted to do
even worse than that --

OZ
That she did --
GLINDA
But you got away... which leads me

to believe: Even if you’re not a
Wizard, you are certainly
resourceful -- and therefore,
perhaps, useful.

OZ
(scowls)
What’re you getting at?

GLINDA
The Good People of Oz have been
waiting for a Wizard to come and
free them from Evanora’s Evil Rule.
And even if you’re not that Wizard,
right now you’re the only Wizard
I've got...

She walks out onto the balcony.
56.

GLINDA
The only Wizard they've got.

Oz looks puzzled -- Glinda gestures: Come look.

EXT. GLINDA’S CASTLE BALCONY
Oz steps out, and sees:

A SEA OF PEOPLE -- hundreds, maybe thousands of them --
streaming towards the castle from every direction.

OZ
Who in the Devil are they?

GLINDA
The Good People of the South.
They’ve come to see the Great
Wizard who’s going to lead them
against the Sisters and their
Savage Army.

Oz gapes at her -- then stares out at the in-coming flood --
and they're coming from different cities, different clans,
different tribes -- we go in closer and see:

CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS -- who, from the front, look very
impressive -- marching smartly, rifles on their shoulders,
dressed like Beefeater Guards... HAMMERHEADS, whom we’ve
already met... DAINTY CHINA SOLDIERS AND FARMERS -- their
glazed china clothes and bodies shining in the sun... A
PHALANX OF FUDDLES -- fairly normal-looking people except for

the thick haphazard puzzle-piece lines on their faces and
bodies and clothes...and lastly: THE STERLING INHABITANTS OF
UTENSIA -- who are walking kitchen utensils: KNIVES and

FORKS and CLEAVERS and SCISSORS and SPOONS -- all with eyes
and arms and legs -- the Scissors en pointe like ballerinas --

And when the Good People of the South look up and see Oz, a
TREMENDOUS CHEER goes up -- Oz feels obliged to wave back to
hem -- says to Glinda, through a fixed smile --

OZ
All these people... they want me to
lead them into battle?

GLINDA
They want the Land of Oz to be
free.
57.

OZ
Okay, look -- you need a Wizard,
I'll be a Wizard -- but I’m not a
Warlord. What you need is someone
with brains and heart and courage --

GLINDA
We need you.

OZ
Why? Why can’t you do it?
Theodora told me you were the most
powerful Sorceress of all.

GLINDA

But there are two Wicked Sisters,
and if I try to fight them alone
they might well destroy me -- and
if I should die, Hope and Dreams
would die here in the Land of Oz --
would die for a thousand years.

(adamant )
No -- it has to be you.

OZ
And what if I say no?

GLINDA
Then I’d be very disappointed.

OZ
You wouldn't be the first.

GLINDA
And I would banish you forever from
Quadling Country.

OZ
Throwing me to the tender mercies
of the Wicked Sisters, you mean.
(then)
And you call yourself a Good Witch.

GLINDA
A Good Witch is still a Witch, and
a Witch wants what she wants -- and

I want these people to be free.

A beat -- then Oz smiles -- craftily -- like something she
just said hit a chord with him.
58.

OZ
Back where I come from, nothing's
free -- so tell you what I’m gonna

do. I’m gonna go down there and
have a little look-see at what
you're giving me to work with --
then you and I are gonna have a
little parlez-vous... so now, if
you'll excuse me...

He moves past her, climbs over the railing and climbs down
the trellis which goes from the balcony to the ground.
Glinda signals to Kala -- Kala flaps down to join Oz as --

QZ REVIEWS THE TROOPS -- Kala trailing behind him like a
Master Sergeant. And to call this a Highly Irregular Army is
to put it mildly. 0Oz first stops in front of:

THE HAMMERHEADS -- a lot more of them than there were before
-- all looking as surly as an armless gang of Dead End Kids
or card-carrying members of the Lollipop Guild.

OZ
I've already seen these boys in
action -- a good group to have if

you get into a tussle.

The Hammerheads nod to each other -- still scowling, but
satisfied -- and Oz moves on to:
THE DAINTY CHINA SOLDIERS AND FARMERS -- all as smooth and

glossy and apple-cheeked as Dresden figurines.

OZ
Very pretty -- but can they fight?

Kala discreetly shakes a no. Next up:

THE FUDDLES -- who all stiffen their spines and try to look
stalwart and strong for Oz -- who can’t help but stare at the
thick jigsaw lines which pattern each of their bodies and
faces like scars. Their leader is named FARNSWORTH --

OZ
What happened to you people?

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
What happened? Nothing happened --
we were born like this.

OZ
I see.
59.

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
Do you? Most people find us
rather... puzzling.

OZ
Can you fight?

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE

We love to fight, sir -- provided,
of course, that nothing untoward or
unexpected occurs -- you know:

Loud noises, sudden attacks --
anything that would get us
frightened or surprised. The thing
is, sir, we Fuddles have a tendency
of sometimes falling all to pieces.

 

OZ
Falling all to --?
And just like that: THE FUDDLE FALLS TO PIECES -- just
collapses in a jigsaw heap -- there’s part of his face here,

half his shoulder there, the crook of an elbow next to that.

OZ
(absolutely flabbergasted)
Did he just --? He did, he just...

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE (0.S.)
Don’t concern yourself, sir -- I’m
quite all right!

Oz looks closer: a puzzle piece of Farnsworth’s MOUTH is
moving -- under another piece which features a BLINKING EYE.

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
See? -- I'll have myself back
together in no time.

He’s already piecing himself back together.

OZ
Does it hurt when you do that?

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
Not at all, sir. Coming apart at
the seams is actually quite
relaxing -- relieves a lot of
stress, as you can imagine.

Oz looks at Kala, then moves on to:
60.

THE CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS -- and there seem to be thousands of

them -- all almost identical in their military finery, in

perfect lines and perfect rows -- and Oz sounds pleased --
OZ

Ah, here we go! Now these men look
like soldiers! These men --

 

He’s so happy he claps one of the Soldiers on the shoulder --
and the Cuttenclip’s torso RIPS almost in two! And this so
startles Oz that suddenly he SNEEZES -- and dozens of the
Cuttenclips go flutter-flying back into one another as though
they just got hit with a bomb-blast!

OZ
Are these men made of... paper?
KALA
Oh yes -- magic paper -- a little
old lady, she makes them! -- she’s

very-very jolly, very sweet --

OZ
(glaring up at Glinda)
But they’re paper! You're giving
me Paper Soldiers?

He moves on to the Utensils -- who look hard and honed --
OZ
Now we're talking... yes... I

reckon these Sterling Citizens
could kill a Savage or two!

GLINDA
No, they cannot.

OZ
Excuse me?

GLINDA
They are enchanted -- and anything
enchanted cannot kill.
And this knocks 0z completely for a loop.

OZ
Can I... speak to you a moment?

And he clambers back up the trellis, heatedly gestures for
Glinda to join him back in --
61.

INT. GLINDA’S PRIVATE CHAMBER

OZ
You're telling me that none of
these People can kill?

 

GLINDA
No one born here in Oz can kill...
except Witches -- and Wizards --
OZ

And the Sisters’ Savage Army?

GLINDA
The Savages are not from here...
nor are they enchanted.

OZ
So you're saying: They can kill.
But the Good People of Oz --

GLINDA
Cannot.

OZ
You want me to lead an Army that
can’t kill.

GLINDA
If this were easy, we wouldn’t need
a Wizard, would we?

OZ
(sly as hell)
That's right... and, like you said,
right now I’m the only Wizard
you've got. So what I want to know
is: What’s in it for me?

GLINDA
Excuse me?

-- and now Oz is in his element -- he’s seen an angle here
and he’s working it --

OZ
What’d you think, you were dealing
with some babe in the woods here,
all dewy-eyed and wet behind the
ears? No, and the way I see it:
Banish me and you've got nothing --
they've got nothing -- so what I
wanna know is: I do this for you,
and what do I get out of it?
62.

GLINDA
(ice)
What do you want?

OZ

If I’m gonna risk my neck I wanna
be rewarded. Which means: If, in
the highly unlikely event we
somehow manage to defeat the Wicked
Sisters and their Savage Horde, as
soon as we march into the Emerald
City I wanna go straight to that
room Evanora took me to and I wanna
load up with all the gold and
jewels and gemstones I can carry,
then I wanna get out of this
cockamamie country and go somewhere
where Monkeys don’t fly and Witches
aren’t trying to kill me and
everyone else isn’t looking to me
like I’m the Answer to questions
that have nothing to do with me!

(then, rhapsodically)
I just wanna go where the rich
people go... I wanna walk through
rooms of soft carpet, I wanna sleep
in beds of eiderdown, I wanna drink
champagne out of cut crystal and I
wanna live in a house high on a
hill -- and when I pass by people
on the street in my gilded carriage
I want them to turn to each other
and say: There goes somebody.

-- seeing it in his mind’s eye -- liking what he’s seeing.

GLINDA

Very well then. That would be a

small price to pay for the freedom

of my people.
OZ

Then it sounds like you and me have

got ourselves a deal.

He grins, steps past her, back onto --

EXT. GLINDA’S BALCONY

Where again he looks out over the crowd again -- at their
upturned faces -- seeing their hope and their faith, then --
63.

GLINDA
And wouldn’t it be funny... if you
turned out to be the man they
imagine you to be...?
(he snaps a look at her)
... The man you’ve always dreamed

of being?
He stares -- she struck a nerve -- it’s like she looked right
through him -- and she smiles -- knowingly -- he looks back
out at the Sea of People -- as we go --

INT. EMERALD CITY - THRONE ROOM - SAME
Evanora’s gazing into her CRYSTAL BALL -- Theodora comes in.
EVANORA

Ah. There you are. Come see: I
was right.

SEEING: OZ AND GLINDA -- IN THE CRYSTAL BALL -- still out
on Glinda’s Castle Balcony -- the huge crowd still below...
EVANORA
Your Wizard and Glinda are now
together. He has chosen... soon

you must too...

She turns her gaze on Theodora -- Theodora tries to keep
expression out of her face -- but still...
EVANORA
It hurts, doesn’t it -- I can see

it, yes: it pains your heart...
-- her words like a drip-drip-drip of slow poison --

EVANORA

To know he used you... to know he
played you for a fool... he made
you believe, didn’t he? -- and do
you still?... what do you think,
that someday he'll be coming back
for you, ask you to be his Lady
Love and Queen?

(a smile)
Don’t worry, my pretty, he will be
coming back...

 

A flicker of hope -- but then the Diamond Dagger suddenly
appears in Evanora’s hand --
64.

EVANORA
.-. But not to ask you for your
hand -- he'll be coming to chop off
your head!

And Theodora -- deeply stung -- bolts from the room --

INT. THE INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR - WITH THEODORA

Running -- actually seems to be fighting back tears, and --
THEODORA
No -- No!
-- hands to her face now, over her eyes -- and she stumbles --
THEODORA

Don’t! Do not! Stop!

She wails -- in pain -- blindly keeps moving -- staggering --

INT. THEODORA’S ROOM

She stumbles in -- one hand still across her face -- feels
her way across the room to the Mirror on the Wall. She
stands in front of it, removes her hand, and we see:

THEODORA -- IN THE MIRROR -- and she has been crying -- still
is: a single tear leaking from each eye -- and both those
tears are leaving burn-lines on her face -- smoke rising...

 

Theodora -- breathing hard -- berating herself --

THEODORA
Stupid. So stupid. Serves you
right.
She dabs at her eyes, then sees: 0Z’S MUSIC BOX -- and with

a quick backhand swipe: SHE KNOCKS THE MUSIC BOX SMASHING TO
THE FLOOR.

 

A MUNCHKIN MAID hears the crash, comes hurrying in. Theodora
resumes staring into the Mirror, just says --

THEODORA
Get _a broom.
EXT. GLINDA’S CASTLE - NIGHT

The crystal spires against a backdrop of a zillion stars.
65.

OZ (0.S.)
And what’s this here, to the east
of the Emerald City?

INT. GLINDA’S LIBRARY

A LAND MAP OF OZ -- spread out on a low table in front of a
blazing fireplace, the room’s only light -- 0Z AND GLINDA on
separate chairs, shadows fluid on their faces.

GLINDA
Those are the Deadly Poppy Fields.
Steer well clear of them -- they
can put you to sleep forever.

OZ
Right now eternal rest doesn’t
sound too bad.

He yawns, picks up his goblet of wine -- then leans back,
rubs his face -- done for the night. Glinda has to ask:
GLINDA

So what do you think? You think
this is going to work?

OZ
C’mon, what’re you worried about?
This is gonna be child's play -- a

walk in the park.

(another big yawn)
I mean, what’s the big deal? All
I've gotta do is lead a rag-tag
bunch of Irregulars who can’t fight
and can't kill against an Army of
Murderous Savages who not only can
fight and can kill but, I’m told,
actually quite enjoy it --

 

GLINDA
-- Yes they do --

OZ
And if somehow, against all odds,
we manage to make our way past the
Heathen Horde, then all we'll be
facing are two Wicked Witches who
not only have some serious magic
literally at their fingertips, but
who, no doubt, are eager to visit
the tortures of Torquemada on my
mind, body and person!

(yawns, rubs his eyes)
(MORE )
66.

OZ (cont'd)
Like I said: Child’s play. What
could be easier?

GLINDA
But that’s what a Wizard does...
he does things everyone knows can’t

be done.
And 0z gives her a long, long look -- he so wants to tell her
the truth -- instead, he drains his goblet, returns his tired
gaze to the flames -- and, almost unconsciously, he takes

that Gold Coin from his pocket, rolls it through his fingers.

OZ
Y'know, back where I come from
there’s a Wizard by the name of
Thomas Alva Edison -- the Wizard of
Menlo Park. I once traveled three
hundred miles just to meet him --
even got to shake his hand.

GLINDA
Is he a Good Wizard?
OZ
No: he is a Great Wizard -- he is

 

a man who made a difference. You
know what he did? He invented the
electric light... and the
phonograph... and a camera that
lets you take moving pictures.

GLINDA
Pictures that move...?

OZ
(eyes closing)
A prime example of good old
American Know-how and Ingenuity.

That’s all it is -- all you need...
good old American Know-how and...
Ingenuity...

He’s asleep. The Gold Coin drops to the floor. Glinda
rises, takes the goblet from his hand, covers him with a
blanket, places the Gold Coin back in his pocket.

GLINDA
Sleep well, Wizard. And dream of
Victory.

DISSOLVE TO:
67.

INT. GLINDA’S LIBRARY - LATER THAT NIGHT
Oz suddenly wakes up -- has his Eureka Moment.

OZ
I’ve got it.

He flings off the blanket, jumps out of the chair, rummages
around the room -- finds what he’s looking for:

SHEETS OF PAPER AND A QUILL-TIP PEN -- and immediately,
feverishly, he gets to work -- sketching, drawing --
designing -- and off the scratching of his pen we jump to:

INT. GLINDA’S PRIVATE CHAMBER —- MORNING

Glinda’s here with Kala -- as Oz bursts in, all excited,
waving his sketches in the air.

OZ

I’ve got it! I know how we can
beat them! What I have in mind is
an historic extravaganza of
Olympian proportions! Using good
old American Know-How and
Ingenuity, smoke and mirrors, Son
et Lumiere, I intend to create an
illusion of such magnificent
magnificence that it will boggle
the mind and bedazzle the senses!
It will, in other words, send the
Sisters and their Savage Army into
such paroxysms of Awe and Wonder
that they will flee the Emerald
City like rats from a burning barn!

(then, much quieter)
And the one tiny little potential
hiccup is... I have no technical
expertise whatsoever and,
therefore, no way of turning these
renderings into reality.

GLINDA
(smiles)
Then you must speak to the Elves at
Smith & Tinkers. They should be
able to help you.

Kala nods -- yes-yes -- and we go --
68.

EXT./INT. SMITH & TINKERS WORKSHOP - DAY

Looks like Santa’s Workshop without the snow -- and the ELVES
look a lot like Santa’s Helpers. Oz is here with Kala. TWO
MASTER ELVES are leafing through Oz’s drawings...

MASTER ELF
Shouldn’t be a problem. When do
you need these by?

OZ
Quick as you can.

MASTER ELF
Come back day after tomorrow. Not
before lunch.

The Master Elves turn and walk away -- already discussing
between themselves who’s going to be doing what.

EXT. SMITH & TINKERS WORKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER
Oz looks up at the sky -- and has a thought.

OZ
That fog the other night -- you
said that was Glinda’s doing? Can
she do that whenever she wants?

KALA
Oh yes -- that and more.

OZ
She’s a heckuva woman, isn’t she?

KALA
(with a scowl)
But I told you, she’s not a woman.

OZ
Yeah-yeah, I know -- got it --
she’s a Witch.

IN. GLINDA’S LIBRARY - LATER THAT DAY

Oz is giving the various CLAN LEADERS their marching orders.
He gestures to some of the Scissor People, and tells the very
old, strangely girlish, apple-cheeked MISS CUTTENCLIP --

OZ
They’1l help you -- just tell ‘em
what to do and how to do it.
(MORE )
69.

OZ (cont'd)
(then, to everyone)
Any questions?

THE DAINTY CHINA MAYOR stands and gives Oz a snappy salute.

DAINTY CHINA MAYOR
Begging pardon, sir. But the China
People, we want to contribute -- we
want to fight!

The other CHINA PEOPLE present nod in agreement. Oz gets up,
comes over and SHAKES THE MAYOR’S HAND.

OZ
That's very valiant of you -- most
laudable -- and I appreciate the
sentiment, believe me -- but here’s
the thing...

With a quick twist of the wrist, OZ SNAPS OFF THE MAN’S ARM.

OZ
See, that’s a problem.
(hands the man his arm,
then, to the others)
Alright, let's get to work.

MONTAGE: THE CLANS PREPARE FOR WAR

 

Miss Cuttenclip and dozens of magic Scissors are cutting out
hundreds of Paper Soldiers... China People are painting the
Soldiers in martial colors the Fuddles are on the Champ de
Mars, in military rows, and when Farnsworth Fuddle shouts a
command the Fuddles in unison all fall to pieces... the
Hammerheads are practicing their head-butting skills... and
Oz is overseeing everything -- seems more energized than
we've ever seen him. END MONTAGE.

  

 

INT. GLINDA’S LIBRARY - EVENING

Oz is sitting down with Glinda and Kala.

OZ
I’m guessing you have friends
inside the Emerald City -- friends

you can trust.

GLINDA
We do. How many do you need?
70.

OZ
However many the Elves need to set
things up. Now...

GLINDA
(interrupts)
You're enjoying this, aren’t you?

OZ
Enjoying it?

GLINDA
I can tell.

OZ
(a beat)
Can you also tell I’m terrified?

GLINDA
of?

OZ
All of it. I mean... for the first
time in my life people are counting
on me -- they’re relying on me --

GLINDA
And is that so terrible?
OZ
It is if we fail.
GLINDA
We won't.
OZ

But if we do, you said it yourself:
It would mean the Death of Hope and
Dreams here in the Land of Oz.

GLINDA
Then we'll just have to make sure
that doesn’t happen, won’t we?

Another pause, then -- something that’s been bothering him --
OZ
And when we get to the Emerald
City... I was wondering... what

about Theodora?

GLINDA
What about her?
71.

OZ
You think there’s, well, any chance
she might join us? I just
thought... there’s still some good
in her.

GLINDA

Yes there is -- but I’m afraid that
will soon be gone.

(gently)
Theodora’s doomed. She’s tried to
resist her sister and the
wickedness within her for the
longest time -- but that time, I
think, is about to run out... and
even you can’t save her.

INT. SMITH & TINKERS WORKSHOP - NEXT DAY
MASTER ELF
And on this, you’ll notice, we made

a few modifications.

Oz is examining one of the completed contraptions. Kala’s
here with him.

MASTER ELF
We thought if you added a few more
of these -- here, here, and here --

instead of this it should look more
like that, rounded instead of flat.

Oz studies the schematics -- then looks up.
OZ
You're a genius. A genius on par
with the Great Edison himself!
MASTER ELF
Try telling that to my wife.
(moves to next table)
Now over here we've got...
OZ (0.S.)
My father died a broken man...

INT. GLINDA’S LIBRARY - THAT NIGHT

FLAMES IN THE FIREPLACE. OZ AND GLINDA -- alone.
72.

OZ

He was a preacher, who went from
dusty town to dusty town selling
dreams of a better life and a
better world -- but this world and
this life beat him down to next to
nothing, and even as a child I
promised myself that was not gonna
happen to me. I might’ve come from
the dirt but I always believed my
future was in the stars.

(looks over at her)
And I believe that future is now --
I can feel it -- my whole life’s
been leading up to this.

GLINDA
I believe that too. I believe this
is your Destiny.
(beat)
And I believe in you, Wizard.

He gazes at her for quite a while, then, finally...

OZ
You_know I’m not a Wizard.

Of course she does. She reaches over, takes his hand.

GLINDA
But you are a good man -- and
sometimes that’s enough.

OZ
Glinda...

She shakes her head, tells him --

GLINDA
Get some rest. Tomorrow the future
begins.

EXT. GLINDA’S CASTLE - NEXT MORNING

0Z'S ARMY is here in force -- flags and standards flapping in
the breeze -- UTENSILS... HAMMERHEADS... PAPER SOLDIERS...
FUDDLES -- ready to march. DAINTY CHINA PEOPLE are here to
wave their heroes off -- some of the DAINTY CHINA GIRLS so
caught up in the moment they’re actually CRYING SOLID DAINTY
CHINA TEARS -- which fall like pebbles to the ground -- or
shatter into powder.
73.

KALA helps Glinda onto a pure white steed. A FOOTMAN leads a
second horse to Oz -- who can’t help but notice that the
horse’s coat is an ever-changing kaleidoscope of color.

OZ
What kind of horse is this?

FOOTMAN
Why it’s a Horse of a Different
Color, sir.

OZ
Of course it is.

Oz mounts, then wheels and gives his troops his best Henry V.

OZ

My friends! Back where I come from
we have a saying: Ad astra per
aspera -- it’s the motto of the
Great State of Kansas and in Wizard-
speak it means: “To the stars,
through difficulties.” We also
say: E Pluribus Unum: “Out of
many, one.” And that is us today:
One people -- one army -- and,
together, we shall reach the stars!
Are you with me!

(the Army roars back a

resounding YES!)
Are you with me!

A louder YES! -- then, to Glinda, under his breath --
OZ
This is your last chance to talk me
out of this.
Glinda just smiles -- then shouts out to the troops:

GLINDA
TO OZ AND THE EMERALD CITY!

The Army starts to march -- the China People wave and weep
and hurrah -- and we PULL BACK and UP and we go --
INT. THRONE ROOM - EVANORA’S PALACE

The Wicked Sisters are SEEING 0Z'S ARMY IN THE CRYSTAL.
74.

EVANORA
And so they march. Soon there will
be no more sand in the hourglass...
soon you must decide...

Theodora turns to her -- fretful -- torn -- and we go --

EXT. THE SHIMMERING WALL - MORNING

Oz‘s Army approaches the border -- everything on the other
side wavy, mirage-like -- then Glinda sweeps an arm, and the
SHIMMERING WALL DISAPPEARS -- Central Oz is now clear as a
bell. Oz himself looks skyward.
OZ
Nice day we’re having... but I’m

told the weather around here can
change just like that.

-- snapping his fingers -- then Glinda smiles --

GLINDA
Actually it’s more like this...

And she slowly raises her arms, calling forth:

AN ENORMOUS SNOWSTORM

A WALL OF WHITE comes ROARING in out of nowhere and engulfs
the whole of Oz’s Army in a HOWLING BLIZZARD --

FROM ABOVE WE SEE THE STORM spreading over them -- spreading
wide -- spreading miles in every direction -- wide enough
that it would be impossible to pinpoint the Army’s location --
and the strangest thing is...

WITH THE ARMY -- INSIDE THE STORM -- the weather here is...
perfectly calm. It’s like they’re in the eye of a wintry
hurricane -- in the middle of a parted Red Sea -- with
towering clouds VORTEXING above and all around them -- a
swirling ceiling, whirling walls -- but down here at ground
level, there’s only the slightest breeze...

OZ
You, m’lady, are magnificent.
(then, to the troops)

Abracadabra, ad astra per aspera
and E Pluribus Unum!

And as the Army moves forward -- THE CALM EYE OF THE STORM
MOVES WITH THEM...
75.

EVANORA (0.S.)
And still you hesitate...

INT. THRONE ROOM
THE SISTERS -- gazing into the Crystal -- seeing the Storm --

EVANORA

What’s it going to take, Sister?
Do you intend to wait until they’re
inside the city gates?...

(suddenly grabs Theodora

by the hair)
I_cannot wait any longer! I need
you and I need you NOW!

Theodora wrenches free -- Evanora keeps at it, keeps on her --

EVANORA
What are you so frightened of!
WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING ON TO! He
doesn’t love you! He will never
love you! He is coming here to
KILL you!

Once again THE DIAMOND DAGGER magically appears in her hand --
she savagely stabs it into the table, embedding the blade in
the wood.

EVANORA
The time has come -- you must
ACCEPT the Evil inside of you! You
must EMBRACE THE HATE!

Theodora -- eyes on the Dagger -- finally shrieks --
THEODORA
ALRIGHT! Stop it! -- alright! --
I'll do it...
Evanora suppresses a smile -- crooks a finger --
EVANORA
Come.

INT. GRAND DINING ROOM - EVANORA’S PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

Theodora’s seated at the table -- staring -- as Evanora DRIPS
POTION from a vial on a SHINY RED APPLE -- drop by drop...
THEODORA

Will it hurt?
76.

EVANORA
Fleetingly. Then you'll never feel
pain again.

THEODORA
Nor love.

EVANORA

What good has love ever done you?
What good has good ever done you?

(the apple’s ready)
There now. One bite is all it
takes. One bite, and the world
will change forever... one bite,
and you'll be able to fly... one
bite -- or Glinda will soon be
seated on the Emerald Throne -- as_
the Wizard's Blessed Queen...

That does it: Theodora snatches up the apple, takes a savage
bite, and almost immediately it begins:

THEODORA’S TRANSFORMATION

A violent inner upheaval -- the sudden shock and pain of it
flashing across her face -- she PUSHES BACK FROM THE TABLE,
hand to her chest -- CONVULSING -- shrieking --

THEODORA
WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME!

EVANORA
(soothingly)
That’s only what’s left of your
heart... withering away. Soon, my
pretty, you’ll feel nothing at all
except... beautiful wickedness.

Theodora’s gasping, fighting for air -- face and body
contorted -- she sinks to the floor -- hunched over -- folded
in on herself -- face hidden -- her breathing slows, then...

THEODORA
Oh yes... yes... now I understand.

And as she lifts her face we see: Her CHIN has lengthened...
her NOSE has hooked and grown... and HER SKIN HAS TURNED
COMPLETELY GREEN -- and she has become:

THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST

She sees her hand -- sees the color -- feels her nose and
chin -- goes to the Mirror on the Wall... gazes at herself.
77.

EVANORA
A simple enchantment can have you
looking just the way you were... if
you want.

THEODORA
No. This is me now.

She whirls around -- lurches to the window -- flings it open
-- orders the SAVAGE GENERALS waiting in the courtyard below:

THEODORA
Keep only enough of you here to
protect the Palace and the Queen.
The rest of you: You will
exterminate the Wizard's Army --
but leave the Wizard himself for

me! Now go -- GO!
WHIMSIE GENERAL
But... who are you?
A beat -- then Theodora CACKLES -- proudly proclaims --
THEODORA

I_AM THEODORA -- THE WICKED WITCH
OF THE WEST!

The Generals storm off, as --

THEODORA
Hurry, Wizard -- I want to dance
with you again -- a different dance
this time -- a wedding dance... I
got married, you see -- to
Wickedness -- and from now on: The

bride will wear only black!

EXT. EMERALD CITY - DAY

THE SAVAGE ARMY thunders out of the city -- Gnomes, Whimsies,
Growleywogs, Winged Monkeys --

EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ

The Savages flood onto the Great Plain -- fanning out -- but
then, look out, here it comes --

GLINDA’S STORM -- A ROLLING, BILLOWING WALL OF WHITE

 
78.

It SLAMS into the Savage Army -- with shrieking winds --

slashing ice and snow -- the Winged Monkeys are flung from
the sky like rag dolls -- and all the Savage Army can do is
hunker down right where they are -- huddled together -- soon

they're covered, mounded in snow, and --

INT. THRONE ROOM

Theodora fights to shut the window against the wind --

finally gets it closed -- wheels to face her sister --
THEODORA
Look at you -- calm as a clam.
EVANORA

A storm like this is no easy task,
even for a Sorceress as powerful as
Glinda. The longer it lasts...

THEODORA
-- the weaker she’1l become --

EVANORA
And when it ends we'll get to see
what kind of a Wizard this Wizard
really is... if he’s the Wizard
everyone says he is...

THEODORA
You don’t believe, Sister?

EVANORA
I believe we shall see.

EXT. WITH OZ’S ARMY - IN THE EYE OF THE STORM - EARLY EVENING

Oz is watching Glinda closely -- and the Sisters were right:
The storm has clearly weakened her. Oz glances at Kala.
OZ

How much further?

KALA
We're here.

And as the wall of snow in front of us recedes we see:

A PYRAMID OF ROCKS

A jumble of boulders fifty feet high.
79.

OZ
The Caves are under there? How do
we get in?

KALA
Magic.
-- looking to Glinda -- and she summons up the last of her

strength, circles her hand in the air, and...

THE STORM WALLS START CLOSING IN ON THEM -- narrowing and
lifting to form a spiralling FUNNEL overhead -- Glinda
directs this snaky funnel over to the Pyramid -- to one

particular HUGE BOULDER -- and THE FUNNEL PICKS IT UP AND
WHISKS IT AWAY just like Dorothy’s Farmhouse, revealing:

 

THE MOUTH OF THE CAVES. Oz, impressed, turns to compliment
Glinda, just as her eyes roll up in her head -- Oz leaps off
his horse, CATCHES GLINDA AS SHE FALLS -- passed out.

THE STORM IS OVER. Night’s falling fast. Oz carries Glinda
into the Caves, while --
EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ

The Storm has ended here, too -- the Savages are digging
themselves out of the snow -- a GNOME GENERAL is saying --

GNOME GENERAL

Let’s get some fires going. We’1l
camp here tonight.

INT. THE CAVES

Torchlight reveals: A SUBTERRANEAN WONDERLAND -- a vast

central cavern -- towering stalactites and stalagmites -- an

underground river -- tunnels stretching into the darkness...
KALA

The tunnels, they go all the way
under the Impassable Desert right
into the Savage Lands.

OZ
(still holding Glinda)
So that’s how the Savages got here.

KALA
Evanora, she brought them in -- to
help her fight-fight Glinda’s
father. He’s the one who closed
the Caves, just before he died.
80.

OZ
How did he die?

KALA
I thought you knew. He died saving
Glinda. Evanora, she killed him.

(then)
Come-come, we find a place to lay
her down.

INT. A CHAPEL-LIKE HOLLOW IN THE CAVE WALL

Oz gently sets Glinda down inside it.

KALA
They were friends, you know --
Glinda and Evanora... and Evanora,

she used that friendship, used
Glinda’s goodness to trick-trick
and trap her, because she knew that
Glinda’s Father the King would do
everything in his power to save
her... and that’s when Evanora, she
struck like a snake. Glinda, she
saw her father die.

OZ

Killed by her friend.

(echoes Theodora)
She had no idea how wicked
wickedness could be, or how easily
friendship could be betrayed.

(then)
How long will she sleep?

KALA
Whatever you do, don’t try to waky-
wake her with a kiss. We need you,
Wizard.

OZ

(a quizzical look, then)
Let’s get everyone ready.

INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE CAVES - LATER

Sparks fly as, one by one, Scissors, Knives and Cleavers step
up to hone their blades against live spinning Whetstones.

SERGEANT CLEAVER
Next! -- let’s go! -- look sharp!
81.

Oz passes by -- and a little further on we see: TWO
HAMMERHEADS -- HARASSING A PAPER SOLDIER -- using their
breaths to huff and puff him back and forth between them.

 

OZ
C’mon, boys, leave him alone.

The Hammerheads scowl, but stop. Kala appears.

KALA
The Munchkins, they are here.

INT. OUTSIDE THE CAVES - THE PYRAMID OF ROCKS - NIGHT

EMERALD CITY MUNCHKINS -- Glinda and Kala’s inside guys --

are helping the Smith & Tinker Elves load their stuff onto

small wagons and carts, pulled by MINIATURE HORSES. Oz and
Kala are with the main MUNCHKIN, who’s named M.

OZ
We’re counting on you.

M. MUNCHKIN
And the Good People of Oz are
counting on you.

Both smile, shake hands.

OZ
See you in Emerald City.
(then --)
What’s the matter?

M. MUNCHKIN
Nothing, just... thought you’d be
bigger.

-- and this from a guy about three feet tall -- and as he
climbs on his tiny horse he says --

M. MUNCHKIN
The others will be here before
first light.

The Munchkins and the Elves start out.

INT. THE CAVES - WITH GLINDA - LATER

Still asleep -- then her eyes butterfly open -- she sees 0z
sitting nearby -- he’s been watching her sleep. He smiles.
82.

OZ
You're awake.

GLINDA
And restored.

OZ
We're ready whenever you are.
INT. THE CAVES - MOMENTS LATER

Oz stands with arms as extended, as those freshly-sharpened
Scissors and Knives and Cleavers climb up his legs and torso

 

and_settle themselves in -- in his belt -- in his pockets --
he’s soon sheathed in steel, bristling with blades -- other
honed Utensils are loading themselves onto Kala -- still
others are stepping into a rucksack -- which Oz loops over
his shoulders -- then he looks to Glinda --

OZ

Let’s do it.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVES - THE PYRAMID OF ROCKS

GLINDA
Step closer.

Oz does -- Glinda makes a little motion with her hand -- and
the two of them are enveloped by THE MAGIC BUBBLE --

0Z -- INSIDE THE BUBBLE -- marveling -- excited --

OZ
Sure beats a broomstick doesn’t it?

THE MAGIC BUBBLE AND KALA FLY OFF, to --

EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ - NIGHT

OVERLOOKING THE ENEMY ENCAMPMENT. The Savage Army is asleep:
a grunting, snoring, wheezing, scratching, mumbling sleep.
Then we see, coming out of the night sky to the south:

THE MAGIC BUBBLE -- AND KALA. They land on the ridge
overlooking the encampment, then head down the hill with Kala
and the Knives and Scissors and Cleavers --

INTO THE ENEMY ENCAMPMENT -- where quickly, quietly, the
Utensils climb off Oz and Kala and out of the rucksack, and
they all get to work CLIPPING AND CHOPPING OFF THE GNOMES’
BEARDS -- AND SLICING THE MASKS OFF THE WHIMSIE WARRIORS.

 
83.

And we get our first look at the Whimsies real heads -- and

they really are just appallingly, embarrassingly small. Oz
and Glinda and Kala keep snipping and shearing, and we --

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVES - THE PYRAMID OF ROCKS - NIGHT

Just before dawn. Oz and Glinda and Kala return with the
Utensils -- Mission Accomplished, safe and sound -- to find:

MUNCHKINS have arrived with MINIATURE MUNCHKIN HORSE-DRAWN
HAY WAGONS AND OX CARTS. Cuttenclip Soldiers are marching
out of the Cave and loading themselves onto the carts and
wagons -- laying themselves flat, one on top of the other, so
that hundreds can be stacked together and still only be as
high as a couple of reams of paper. The Munchkin teamsters
then COVER THEM UP WITH HAY. We also see:

THE FUDDLES and THE HAMMERHEADS are ready to move out
together. Oz shakes Farnsworth Fuddle’s hand.

OZ
Safe journey. Keep yourselves
together, men!
(then, to the Hammerheads)
And you boys, use your heads! Give
‘em what-for!

The Army starts out -- the Hammerheads and Fuddles heading
west -- the Munchkins heading north with the hay-hidden Paper
Soldiers. Then Glinda closes her eyes -- like she’s
receiving a transmission of some kind -- then she smiles --

GLINDA
The Elves have made it safely into
the Emerald City.

KALA
And look-look.

Behind the eastern hills: The first glimmer of dawn.

EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ - THE ENEMY ENCAMPMENT — SAME

And as the Savage Army starts to awaken, we start to hear...
AN UNGODLY HOWLING -- a great wailing and gnashing of teeth --
as Gnomes realize they've been barbered -- Whimsies see
they've been E-mask-ulated -- and they’re horrified -- beside
themselves -- can’t deal -- and so --

 
84.

THEY RUN -- just go instant AWOL -- A MAD, MASS STAMPEDE --
collisions -- confusion -- Savages scattering in every
direction -- as we hear a furious prolonged SCREECH and go --

INT. THRONE ROOM - EMERALD CITY - SAME

THEODORA comes running in -- now dressed head to toe in
witchy black -- she heard the screech -- Evanora’s screech --
sees Evanora staring into the Crystal -- seething --

EVANORA
The Gnomes -- the Whimsies --
they're fleeing -- they’re gone.
THEODORA

Glinda alone couldn’t have made
them do that. The Wizard's Army,
where are they!

EVANORA
I haven’t found them yet.

THEODORA
Soon as you do, you let me know.

-- already on her way out, and we FOLLOW HER out to --

INT. THE INCREDIBLY LONG VAULTED CORRIDOR

As she storms down the hall, she sees a Munchkin Maid,
SWEEPING THE MARBLE FLOOR. Theodora snatches away the broom.

THEODORA
Give me that! He wanted a broom?
I'll give him a broom, and sweep
him to his doom!

EXT. OUTSIDE EVANORA'’S PALACE

THEODORA comes out -- and FLIES OFF ON HER BROOMSTICK --
grim, determined, focused -- a black bolt across blue sky --

M. MUNCHKIN AND THE MASTER ELF -- hidden -- watch her from
below -- then go back to their secret preparations...
EXT. ENCHANTED APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

THE HAMMERHEADS AND FUDDLES have reached their destination.
85.

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
Alright, everyone, spread out, and
prepare yourselves...

INT. THRONE ROOM - EMERALD CITY
EVANORA’s watching this all on her Crystal Ball --

EVANORA
Sister. The Enchanted Orchard...

EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ - SAME

THEODORA has arrived to take charge of the Savage Army --
surrounded by Growleywogs and Nikko and the Winged Monkeys --
she’s telepathically communicating with her sister -- then
she whirls, orders Nikko and the Monkeys --

THEODORA
To the Enchanted Orchard! Kill
everyone you see! Go!
(the Monkeys fly off)
The rest of you: I want a line of
sharpened steel between here and
the Emerald City.

The Growleywogs move out to form a Maginot Line across
Central Oz. Meanwhile --
INT. THE CAVES - SAME
GLINDA frowns -- she senses -- knows --
GLINDA
The Winged Monkeys are on their way

to the Orchard.

Oz nods -- exhales -- here we go -- D-Day’s about to begin...

EXT. ENCHANTED ORCHARD - DAY

SEEING: THE WINGED MONKEYS -- IN-COMING -- a dark cloud
against the sky like a murder of evil crows.

FARNSWORTH FUDDLE
Brace yourselves, men! Hold firm
and wait until they land!

THE FUDDLES straighten their shoulders, stiffen their spines.
There’s no sign of the Hammerheads.
86.

NIKKO AND THE WINGED MONKEYS SWOOP IN -- hit the ground
running -- drawing short swords from their belts -- and with
horrific simian shrieks they come charging at:

THE FUDDLES -- WHO IMMEDIATELY ALL FALL TO PIECES -- every
man-jack among them just fragments and collapses, and --

THE WINGED MONKEYS ARE CONFUSED -- their primitive little

brains weren’t expecting this -- and they warily come forward
and start pawing through the puzzle piles -- inspect them
with ignorant frowns -- and then, now that all the Monkeys

are here on the ground --

THE HAMMERHEADS ATTACK -- spring out from behind the trees
and start jackhammering the Monkeys with their Jack-in-the-
Box heads -- ping-ponging the primates between them -- the

FUDDLES QUICKLY RE-ASSEMBLE AND JOIN THE FIGHT, and --

THE HAMMERHEADS AND FUDDLES LAUNCH THE MONKEYS INTO THE TREES
-- high up into the branches, snapping off leaves and twigs
and apples -- and the Trees don’t like that one bit, and they
start WHALING ON THE WINGED MONKEYS -- limbs and branches
just hammering the hell out of them, and soon --

 

THE MONKEYS ARE FINISHED -- every one of them TKO’ed. The
Fuddles tie the Monkeys up. Victory is theirs.

INT. THE CAVES - SAME

GLINDA suddenly starts SMILING -- Oz sees it, and knows --

OZ
They did it?
(off her nod)
Now the Cuttenclips -- if they make
it through.
Her smile fades -- she shares his concern -- and we go --

EXT. ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT ROADS IN CENTRAL OZ - DAY

IN A QUICK MONTAGE WE SEE: MUNCHKIN WAGONS AND CARTS --
getting STOPPED by Growleywog Warriors. Some of the wagons
are just waved on through -- others receive a rudimentary
SEARCH -- which entails nothing more than a Growleywog
jabbing his spear in the straw. Then they wave the Munchkins
on, and we END MONTAGE and go:

 
87.

EXT. THE POPPY FIELDS — AFTERNOON

And it is a Sea of Scarlet Poppies -- poppies whose odor is,
according to Baum, ‘so powerful that anyone who breathes it
falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the
scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever.’

THE MUNCHKIN TEAMSTERS have halted a safe distance from the
fields, remove the hay and straw from the carts. THE
CUTTENCLIP PAPER SOLDIERS PEEL THEMSELVES OFF ONE ANOTHER AND
DISEMBARK -- some of them sporting the rips and tears they
received from the points of probing Growleywog spears. THE
PAPER SOLDIERS MARCH INTO POSITION -- form into rows in front
of the rolling red fields -- mightily impressive, and --

INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME
EVANORA sees this on her Crystal Ball, says --
EVANORA
Sister...
EXT. THE GREAT PLAIN OF OZ

THEODORA cocks an ear -- receives Evanora’s silent message --
shouts to the Growleywog Warriors nearby --

THEODORA
To the Poppy Fields! Follow me!
She hops on her broomstick -- takes off -- shoots down the
line of Warriors -- spreading the word --

INT. THE CAVES
GLINDA's seeing this in her mind’s eye -- tells Oz --
GLINDA

Theodora and her Warriors are
heading for the Poppy Fields.

OZ
Please don’t let there be a wind --
not yet --
GLINDA
I won't.
Oz glances at Kala -- who’s quiet, worried -- clearly

whatever's about to happen is crucial to Oz’s plan...
88.

EXT. THE POPPY FIELDS - AFTERNOON

FROM THE PAPER SOLDIERS’ POV: First they see THEODORA on her
broomstick -- a black onrushing dot in the sky -- then the
loping ARMY OF GROWLEYWOGS, spear-tips flashing in the sun.

FROM THE GROWLEYWOGS’ POV: A countless number of blue-
jacketed Cuttenclips in front of the red, red fields.

THEODORA
Just remember they can’t kill you.
Now water those pretty red flowers
-- with pretty red blood.

THE GROWLEYWOG GENERAL turns, raises his spear, lets out some
guttural war-cry, snaps his spear down -- and THE GROWLEYWOGS
LET FLY WITH A THOUSAND ARROWS.

THE CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS look up -- see this arrow-storm
sizzling towards them -- the Cuttenclips stand their ground --
and_the arrows pass right through them -- not a single

soldier falls, and --

 

THEODORA’s stunned -- What just happened? -- and --

INT. THE CAVES - CLOSE ON GLINDA
GLINDA
(eyes closed)
Now...

And she puffs out her cheeks and BLOWS, and --

EXT. THE POPPY FIELDS - ON THE CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS

A SUDDEN WIND SWEEPS IN AND BLOWS THE CUTTENCLIP SOLDIERS

 

 

BACK INTO THE POPPIES -- so it looks like they’re retreating
-- and the GROWLEYWOG WARRIORS GO CHARGING UP THE HILL -- war-
whooping like banshees -- a sound to freeze the blood, and --
DEEPER IN THE POPPY FIELDS -- Glinda’s wind keeps fluttering
the Cuttenclips farther into the flowers -- and THEODORA
senses something’s wrong -- and shrieks --
THEODORA

NO! IT’S A TRICK! DON’T --!
THE GROWLEYWOGS don’t listen -- blood lust high -- and _ in
full battle cry they set upon the Cuttenclips -- STABBING and
SLASHING -- RIPPING the Soldiers to shreds -- but then... the

poppies start working their narcotic magic...
89.

THE GROWLEYWOG WARRIORS START DROPPING LIKE OPIATED FLIES --
soon every last one of them is in a deep, drugged sleep...

 

THEODORA can’t believe it -- for the briefest little moment
we see a flicker of fear -- then her eyes narrow --
THEODORA

Deftly done, Wizard -- and Glinda
too, I’m sure. But you haven’t won
yet -- far from it. See you at
Emerald City -- my sister and I
will be waiting...

And she jets off on her broom, back to Emerald City, and --

INT. THE CAVES

GLINDA
Our turn now.

OZ
Showtime.

EXT. EMERALD CITY - THAT NIGHT

A very dark night... SAVAGE GUARDSMEN patrol the gates -- a
GROWLEYWOG WARRIOR mans the ramparts above -- then he hears
something, quickly wheels to his left to see:

KALA -- ZOOMING THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS HIM -- towards us --
fist cocked and: POW! -- Kala crunches a punch into the
Growleywog's jaw, knocking him cold -- the Savage goes down
in a heap, his spear clattering onto stone, and --

OTHER SAVAGE SENTRIES hear it, come racing to investigate --

see KALA -- who scampers -- on foot -- and THE SAVAGES GIVE
CHASE -- and when the balustrade is clear...

THE MAGIC BUBBLE wafts in -- OZ AND GLINDA have arrived in Em
City -- but before they separate, Glinda smiles --

GLINDA
Welcome to your Destiny.

And Oz is as honest as he’s ever been in his life --

OZ
I didn’t do this for Destiny. I
did it for you.
90.

Then quickly, he turns and goes -- Glinda gazing after him --
then she pulls up the hood of her cloak, hiding her face in a
cowl. She moves off, into the shadows, while --

INT. ELSEWHERE IN EMERALD CITY

KALA’s still leading the Guards on a helluva chase, and --

INT. A SMALL DARK CORRIDOR - INSIDE THE PALACE

GLINDA moves along the stone wall -- her hand against it --
then pauses as if she’s listening to something far beyond our
hearing -- and then... SHE STEPS THROUGH THE WALL -- just

walks through solid stone, into --

INT. THRONE ROOM

EVANORA’s on the Emerald Throne -- doesn’t even turn around
as Glinda silently materializes behind her.

EVANORA
I've been expecting you.

GLINDA
Of course you have. You knew this
day would come.

EVANORA
I’m sorry -- am I supposed to be
frightened? -- of you or this false

Wizard of yours?

GLINDA
False Wizard...?

EVANORA
Don’t tell me you believe --

GLINDA
In him? As a matter of fact I do.

EVANORA
You always were so gullible.

GLINDA
Yes, once upon a time I even
believed in you.
gl.

EVANORA
You believed in our friendship.
And you believed that, deep down,
there was some Good inside me...

(sneers)
You were foolish then, you’re
foolish now -- too foolish, I

think, to live. Wouldn’t you
agree, Sister?

THEODORA (0.S.)
Definitely.

Glinda slowly turns -- and there’s Theodora.

THEODORA
So good to see you again, Glinda.

GLINDA
Don’t you look lovely.

THEODORA
Yes, don’t I -- I’m sure your
Wizard would say the same -- he did
tell me green’s his favorite color.

GLINDA
Then I’m sure he’ll enjoy sitting
on the Emerald Throne.

EVANORA
You mean my throne.

GLINDA
I mean my father’s throne. Oz the
Great and Powerful will be sitting
there by morning.

EVANORA
(cackles )
The Great and Powerful --?!

GLINDA
Just you wait -- you'll see.

Then, just as LIGHTNING flashes from Theodora’s fingers,
Glinda abruptly VANISHES INTO THIN AIR. Theodora scowls...

THEODORA
What if she’s right? What if the
Wizard is --?
92.

EVANORA
-- he’s not -- as will be proved to
you by morning -- for by morning

he’1l be dead.
THEODORA

That's a pity. I wanted to kill
him slow.

INT. ELSEWHERE IN EMERALD CITY - WITH OZ

He slips around a corner -- sees, up ahead, in the shadows:
M. MUNCHKIN -- gesturing: This way -- but then --

WINKIE GUARDSMAN (0.S.)
THERE HE IS!

Oz wheels, sees: SIX WINKIE GUARDSMEN... M. Munchkin quickly
slips back into his hiding place as the Guardsmen advance on
Oz -- spears raised -- the steel circle closing -- Oz sees no
escape -- so, thinking fast --

OZ
There who is?

WINKIE GUARDSMAN
You, Wizard.

-- spear-points now inches from 0z, who somehow laughs --

OZ
Wizard? Me? I’m not the Wizard!

And the Guardsmen hesitate...

WINKIE GUARDSMAN
Yes you are -- sure you are.

OZ
How could I be? Gentlemen: Look
at me! I’m just a man, and haven’t
you heard? The Wizard of Oz is ten
feet tall -- he breathes smoke and
fire -- he is by all accounts and
by any stretch of the imagination --

 

But that’s as far as he gets, because: SUDDENLY THE WINKIE
GUARDSMEN ALL COLLAPSE TO THE FLOOR -- their bodies seem to
just disappear, leaving behind a jumble of hats and cloaks
and spears, then... RATS START WRIGGLING OUT FROM UNDER THE
MUDDLE -- the transformed Winkie Guardsmen -- courtesy of:

GLINDA -- to whom a greatly relieved Oz says --
93.

OZ
Thought you’d never get here.
Come on!
M. Munchkin reappears -- Oz and Glinda follow him into the

shadows, as we start to hear: THE TOLLING OF A BELL...

INT./EXT. EMERALD CITY BELL TOWER

KALA’'S RINGING THE BELL -- hauling on the rope like a crazed
Quasimodo -- barricaded here in this tower while, outside,
the SAVAGE GUARDS TRY TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR. And as the
bell continues to loudly Ding and Dong...

EXT. THE STREETS OF EMERALD CITY

THE CITIZENS OF EM CITY come out of their houses -- wondering
what all the commotion’s about, and --

INT. EMERALD CITY BELL TOWER

The SAVAGES successfully smash the door down -- Kala flies
out the tower window -- safely away, and --

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - EMERALD CITY

THE EM CITY CITIZENS gather in the Central Square... SAVAGE
PALACE GUARDS keep them well back from the Palace, and --
INT. IN A SECRET LOCATION - INSIDE EMERALD CITY

THE MASTER ELF is peering out.

OZ (0.S.)
Close the curtain.

The Elf turns, and we see: Oz -- standing inside a circle of
very strange-looking CAMERA DEVICES. He says to Glinda --

 

OZ
Let’s begin.

Glinda gives a sharp wave of her hand, and just like that --

EXT. EMERALD CITY

All the torches in the city go out.
94.

INT. BEHIND THE CURTAIN - IN THE SECRET LOCATION
Glinda pulls the cowl back over her head, smiles at Oz.

GLINDA
Ad_ astra per aspera.

OZ
E Pluribus Unum.

Glinda heads out -- Oz says to the Master Elf --
OZ
Here we go.

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - THE EXTRAVAGANZA BEGINS

DRY-ICE SMOKE starts billowing in from all sides -- hugging
the ground -- prompting murmurs from the crowd... then: from
UNDER THE ARCH OF TRIUMPH -- AN EXPLOSION OF SMOKE AND FIRE.
And even before the smoke clears we hear -- booming,
amplified -- like the Voice of God Himself...

OZ'S VOICE

DO NOT FEAR, GOOD PEOPLE OF OZ --
DO NOT FEAR...

And then, under the Arch -- we see it -- see him: A LARGER-
THAN-LIFE HOLOGRAM OF 0Z -- spectral, see-through --
OZ'S VOICE

IT IS I: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL
WIZARD OF OZ!

GEYSERS OF FIRE shoot up on either side of the Hologram.

0Z'S VOICE
WHERE ARE THE WICKED SISTERS!

EVANORA (0.S.)
We are here...

EVANORA AND THEODORA -- ON THE PALACE BALCONY. Theodora
flicks a hand -- the TORCHES next to them REIGNITE.

EVANORA
And we are anxious to see just how
Great and Powerful you truly are.

Theodora signals -- and the PALACE GUARDSMAN RUSH THE
HOLOGRAM -- SHOOTING ARROWS and FLINGING SPEARS -- which
harmlessly pass right through the Image of Oz -- and when the

 

spears and arrows hit the floor...
95.

GLINDA -- in her shawl -- gestures -- AND THE SPEARS AND
ARROWS TRANSFORM INTO SNAKES -- and go slithering off into
the shadows... THE HOLOGRAM LAUGHS WITH SCORN.
OZ'S VOICE
WICKED SISTERS... IN YOUR

IGNOMINIOUS IGNORANCE AND HATE DID
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT SUCH
PUSILLANIMOUS PIECES OF IMPOTENT
ARMAMENTS COULD HARM THE GREAT AND
POWERFUL 02?

THEODORA
Perhaps you'd prefer this!

And suddenly: THERE’S FIREBALL IN HER HAND -- which she
heaves at the Hologram -- the fireball EXPANDING en route so
that when it hits it totally ENGULFS 0Z'S IMAGE -- turning
the space beneath the Arch INTO A CURTAIN OF FLAME -- the
Citizens shrinking back from the light and the heat and --

BEHIND THE CURTAIN -- IN THE SECRET LOCATION

Oz motions to the Master Elf -- Cut! -- then steps up close
to a single, larger camera-type device, and --

BACK IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE

When the Fireball dies out we see... Oz’s Image is gone.
There’s nothing there under the Arch any longer. THE WICKED
SISTERS CACKLE -- triumphant -- but only for a moment...
BEHIND THE CURTAIN

Oz signals -- the Master Elf flicks a switch, and --

BACK IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE

Another terrific BOOOOOM! of smoke and fire erupts under the
Arch -- and this time when the clouds clear we see:

QZ'S FACE -- AN ENORMOUS SPHERICAL HOLOGRAPHIC MOON FACE --
Like the face Dorothy will see when she goes to see the
Wizard years from now -- and THE MOON FACE starts to grow...
gets BIGGER and BIGGER... then it starts FLOATING UP into the
air... and as it rises, in a voice like rolling thunder --

0Z'S VOICE
HOW DARE YOU DOUBT ME!
96.

THEODORA
Doubt you? -- I DEFY you!

0Z'S VOICE
THEN WITNESS AND OBSERVE... AS I
UNLEASH THE STARS!

 

And then it begins... first a single streak of light zips
across the sky like a meteor... then two more... then three --
zip, zip, zip... then more and more and more -- crissing and

crossing, slashing the sky, then all at once --

It all stops. Theodora and Evanora exchange a look -- Was
that it? -- but then... 0Z’S MOON FACE CHUCKLES... then
THUNDERS LOUDER THAN EVER --

0Z'S VOICE
BEHOLD!

AND THE SKY SEEMS TO EXPLODE! And, as Oz himself would
probably say it, what follows is: ‘A FIREWORKS FANTASIA MORE
SPECTACULAR AND STUPENDOUS THAN ANY THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN!’
And no one in Em City has ever seen anything remotely like it
-- it’s eye-goggling and mind-boggling -- the Fourth of July
times fifty -- and, as Oz had predicted --

THE PALACE GUARD SAVAGES -- terrified -- run like rats from a
burning barn -- break ranks and high-tail it for the hills --

EVANORA
(shrieks to Theodora)
Do something!

THEODORA turns -- then ZAPS A STEADY STREAM OF LIGHTNING from
her fingertips into 0z’s Holographic Moon Face -- and THE
MOON FACE LAUGHS at her -- then BOOMS to the crowd --

0Z'S VOICE
GOOD PEOPLE OF 0Z, LOOK AND SEE:
THE WEAKNESS OF WICKEDNESS!

And we can tell: All this zapping is sapping Theodora’s

strength. The lightning first dims -- then fades out
completely -- and she slumps against the railing.
EVANORA

Sister?
97.

GLINDA -- DOWN BELOW -- IN THE SHADOWS - smiles to herself --
then THRUSTS her hand up and forward -- and _some great
shimmering PULSE OF ENERGY flashes up to the balcony -- THE

 

SURGE SLAMS INTO THE SISTERS -- knocks Evanora clear through
the doorway -- she goes sliding on her backside along the
floor -- her hair awry -- animal fear in her eyes for the
very first time -- THEODORA’s still on the balcony -- on her
hands and knees -- the Sisters lock eyes.
EVANORA
We must leave.
THEODORA
NO!
EVANORA

The night is his. We leave and
there will be other nights.

THEODORA’s wavering -- then a ROMAN CANDLE slams into the
Palace wall right beside her -- EXPLODES IN A SUPERNOVA OF
RED, WHITE AND BLUE.

HIDDEN SMITH & TINKER ELVES FIRE MORE FIREWORKS AT THEODORA --
she’s being bombarded -- rockets and Roman Candles strafing

the Palace walls -- she has to duck and cover -- snarling
with rage -- shrieks towards 0z’s Moon Face --
THEODORA

THIS ISN’T OVER, WIZARD! Mark my
words: You will watch each other
die!

She runs into the Palace, helps her Sister to her feet -- and
the two Wicked Witches beat a hasty retreat down the hall.
INT. THEODORA’S ROOM

Theodora grabs her broomstick, flings open the window. Looks
back -- Evanora’s just standing there -- looks devastated.

EVANORA
Curse them -- curse them all.

THEODORA
Don’t worry, Sister, we will. All
in good time.

Evanora nods -- regally walks past Theodora to the window --
raises her arms, the long folds of her sleeves spreading like
wings -- then SHE TAKES OFF -- soaring like a nighthawk --

THEODORA SAILS AFTER HER -- ON HER BROOM --—
98.

EXT. ON A SPIRE - HIGH ABOVE THE CITY

Kala sees the Wicked Sisters flying away -- has a TRUMPET
looped on a strap -- he BLARES A TANTARA --

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE

Everybody hears it. The fireworks stop. The tantara

continues -- a fanfare of victory -- and THE CELEBRATION
BEGINS -- like an explosion -- an outpouring of utter joy --

Kala flaps down off the spire, and --

BEHIND THE CURTAIN
Kala rushes in -- charged up -- Monkey-laughing --
KALA
We did it, Wizard -- you did it!
The Wicked Witches: Gone-gone!

Oz beams -- Glinda steps through the curtain -- all aglow --

GLINDA
You were wonderful.

OZ
Yeah, that’s me: The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz.

He sweeps her into his arms, is about to kiss her, when --

GLINDA

What are you doing!
OZ

I was... trying to kiss you.
GLINDA

But I’m a Witch.
OZ

Believe me, I’ve kissed worse.
GLINDA

But... my kiss would kill you.

A searching beat -- then he sets her down.

OZ

You mean... kill me kill me? --

 

compos mentis, kill me dead?
99.

She nods -- Kala does, too -- it’s true...
OZ
Not even one tiny kiss?
GLINDA
Much as I might like to, Wizard, I
prefer you alive -- as do the Good

People of Oz.
Her smile’s bittersweet -- Oz shakes his head.

OZ
Ain’t that a kick in the pants?

Kala nods -- yes-yes -- and we go --

EXT. EMERALD CITY -— FOLLOWING DAY

A GLORIOUS CELEBRATION IS IN FULL SWING. There’s a PARADE --
MARCHING BANDS -- DANCING IN THE STREETS. And we see: THE
HAMMERHEADS -- who now have their arms and hands back --
strutting along, some clasping their hands over their heads
like middleweight champs, others shaking hands with everyone

 

within reach -- including THE DAINTY CHINA MAYOR -- the one
whose arm Oz snapped off -- who’s with his daughter the
Dainty China Girl -- and no longer are they Dainty China --

they've been restored to flesh and blood, and--

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE

A STAGE has been erected -- crowded with VIP's -- a MUNCHKIN
DIGNITARY is at the podium proclaiming --

MUNCHKIN DIGNITARY
No one who was here last night will
ever forget it -- Such wizardry!
Such wonder! What a whiz of a Wiz
our Wizard was! So sound the
bells, Ding Dong, Ding Dong, the
Wicked old Witches are gone!

A CHEER goes up -- MUSIC PLAYS -- TOWER BELLS start to RING --

INT. THE ROOM OF RESPLENDENCE

Oz has stuffed his satchel full of about A GAZILLION DOLLARS
WORTH OF GEMS AND JEWELS. But then... he HEARS the Bells,
hears the Citizens break out in song, and he goes to the
window, peeks through the curtain -- sees the Celebration --
the laughing and singing and dancing, then --
100.

GLINDA
Ready, Wizard?
Oz spins, startled -- didn’t hear her come in. Then...
OZ
I’m not going. I’m not leaving Oz.
I can’t.
Glinda holds her breath -- and waits.
OZ
If I did, you know what would
happen here.
GLINDA
The Wicked Sisters would no doubt
return, and could well reclaim the
Emerald Throne.
OZ
And I can’t let that happen. I
won't. The People need a Wizard
and I'll be their Wizard -- I’1l be
the Wizard of Oz.
The answer Glinda had hoped for -- and expected -- she glows.

GLINDA
You're a good man, Wizard.

OZ
Yeah: Who knew?

GLINDA
(sweeps an arm)
Your People await you.

But Oz just shakes his head, glumly.

OZ
No. I can’t do that, either. If I
go down there the Good People of Oz
will see me for what I really am:
A common, ordinary man.

GLINDA
Wizard, you are neither common nor
ordinary.
101.

OZ
Nor am I a Great and Powerful
Wizard -- and that’s what the
People need me to be -- what they
need to believe me to be... they
need a Myth, not a man -- which is
why I can never again let them see
the real me... I’ve got to keep up
the Illusion -- I’ve got to stay
Behind the Curtain...

 

GLINDA
It will get lonely there.

OZ
I know.
(looks at her)
I’m sure you know it, too.

GLINDA
I do -- all too well.

OZ
(another moment, then)
I need a pen and some paper.

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER
KALA comes out of the Palace, clutching a piece of parchment.
He marches towards the stage.
INT. EMERALD THRONE ROOM
0Z AND GLINDA are at the window, watching from behind a
curtain when, suddenly: there’s A SOUND LIKE A SONIC BOOM!
EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE
Everyone stops, looks up and sees, SLASHING ACROSS THE SKY:

THEODORA AND EVANORA -- ON BROOMSTICKS -- burning broomsticks
-- trailing BLACK SMOKE -- SKYWRITING the words...

JUST YOU WAIT

THE CITIZENS exchange nervous glances, nervous murmurs --
THEODORA AND EVANORA finish -- and zoom away -- Theodora
leaving behind one last wicked CACKLE... after they’re gone:
Silence -- uncertainty -- then --
102.

ON THE STAGE -- Kala prods the Munchkin Dignitary -- who
steps to the podium and cries:

MUNCHKIN DIGNITARY

Good People of Oz! I have here a
missive from the Great Wizard
himself! And I quote...

(reads from the parchment)
‘As your Wizard I hereby decree
that henceforth and hereafter the
Land of Oz will forever be Free!’

A GREAT CHEER -- the MUSIC and DANCING start up again, and --

INT. THRONE ROOM - BEHIND THE CURTAIN
0Z AND GLINDA gaze down at the revelers...

OZ
Tell me this isn’t a dream.

GLINDA
It’s no dream.

OZ
Good. I don’t want to wake up and
find out none of this is really
real -- ‘cause y’know something?
(turns and smiles)

There’s no place like Oz.

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE

THE CELEBRATION continues -- but for us we’ve reached...

THE END.
