FADE IN... on a man in a floating hell. We are:
INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (2 A.M.)

An enclosed, fiberglass LIFEBOAT, 28 feet long - with 60
seats, and HATCHES fore and aft. It's steamy, hot, even at
night. Floating on the Indian Ocean, 300 miles from Somalia.

RICHARD PHILLIPS sleeps upright in this sweatbox, at
gunpoint. He's 50, a career merchant mariner - now a hostage.

His captors are four Somali pirates: BILAL is 16, his left
foot wrapped in bloody gauze. ELMI is 25, has a three-colored *
ROPE on his lap. NAJEE is 24. They're asleep too. But:

MUSI, their leader, is wide awake. 25 years old, 5'9", maybe
135 pounds. A rail-thin killer. His hand, bandaged and
bloody, holds an AK-47 as he studies the sleeping Phillips.

After a beat, Musi rises, and "undogs" (opens) the AFT HATCH,
stepping out onto the lifeboat's tiny AFT DECK. He lays his
AK at his feet, and pees off the edge.

Phillips' eyes instantly snap open. Turns out, he was awake. *
He assesses his options - IMAGES, hitting us in a hurry:

Three pirates asleep; the THREE-COLORED ROPE on Elmi's lap;
Musi's back turned to us; the AK on the deck... and SIX FULL
FUEL BUCKETS, tied down in the boat's nose. It's time to go.

So he rises, heads for the aft hatch. The rest is a blur:

EXT. LIFEBOAT - AFT HATCH/AFT DECK - CONTINUING

The craft is orange, shaped like a submarine. Musi pees off *

its deck, the AK at his feet. Phillips can grab it and fire
away. He considers that.

*

But a half-mile away, lit up like a distant jewel, is a US
NAVY GUIDED MISSILE DESTROYER - the USS Bainbridge. 508 feet
long. Immense, powerful, here to rescue him - so...

He pushes Musi off the deck and dives in. We FOLLOW: *

 

EXT. WATER —- CONTINUING - NIGHT

His glasses fly off, gone forever in the cool water. He
starts swimming madly, moonlight shining through. Behind him,

*

Musi surfaces, howling in Somali at his crew. *
Next Phillips hears the engine of the lifeboat roaring to *
life. He swims, kicks, gasps... then he looks back. Oh no: *

The lifeboat is coming at him, Musi clinging to its side. *
Phillips sucks in air, and DIVES down. Even underwater he can *
hear the pirates shouting. The lifeboat passes over him, then *
STOPS, idling right atop him. Phillips can touch its hull. *

He surfaces beneath the bow - a quiet breath - grabs the *
ENGINE COOLING PIPES under the keel and guides himself along. *

FOOTSTEPS on the deck above him. Pirates howling, enraged. He *
ducks under the boat again, comes up on the port side.

But waiting there, in the water, is Musi. Oh shit.
They lunge for each other's throats instantly. Hand-to-hand
combat, just like that. Phillips gets Musi's head under

water, Musi's scream turning into a burble of air.

Holding the guy down - Musi flailing, kicking - Phillips
trying to drown the bastard, until... another nightmare: *

POP POP POP. Three rounds from the AK, whistling past his ear
into the water. He looks up.

Elmi, on deck. Firing. It's over. Phillips releases Musi.

That fast, Phillips is yanked out of the water by Elmi and
Bilal, thrown through that aft hatch and back inside, where:

INT. LIFEBOAT —- CONTINUING

Elmi and Bilal throw him to the floor of the boat. Then they

pounce: beating the hell out of him. Najee jumps in too. Shot
after shot, swarming like angry bees.

NAJEE
We kill you! Kill you!

Shouting, spitting, kicking. Elmi ties Phillips' hands to a
horizontal bar, exposing his torso. Bilal trusses Phillips'
feet to the base of a seat. He's helpless, a punching bag.

.+-as Musi, wet and enraged now, steps up. Silence... Then:
MUSI

How much you worth, Irish? One
million? Two million?

CRACK. A right cross to Phillips' jaw, staggering him. Now *
the others join in again: pounding, spitting, shouting... *
.».-until, gradually, they stop - too winded to continue. *

MUSI (CONT'D)
You stay tied now, like an animal.
And you pee in a bottle.
Phillips is a bruised, bleeding mess. Gasping...

PHILLIPS
I can't feel my hands. You trussed
‘em too tight.

MUSI
Like an animal!

Phillips tries to chew the ropes. Musi hits him again.

MUSI (CONT'D)
Ropes can't touch your mouth! They
are halal!

He walks away. Najee and Elmi follow... leaving Bilal, the
youngest, to stand guard, AK in hand. Bilal studies Phillips,
perplexed. A long quiet beat... then he has to ask:

BILAL
Why you didn't just shoot us?
(Phillips is silent)
Gun was right there. Why you don't
just grab it and shoot us?

PHILLIPS
I just... wanted to go home.

Bilal doesn't respond. He can't. We CUT TO:
EXT. MAERSK - STARBOARD - AMIDSHIP - NIGHT

The MAERSK ALABAMA is a cargo ship: 508 feet long, 83 feet
abeam, displacing 31,000 tons of water. Massive. With a seven-
story superstructure, "The House", rising from her stern.

She idles, a_mile from the lifeboat... as she is boarded by
U.S. NAVY SAILORS - guys climbing up flexible-steel ladders
from two NAVY ZODIACS idling beside the Maersk amidship.

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - SAME

SHANE MURPHY stands at the helm of the Maersk, 120 feet above
the waterline. He's Chief Mate on this ship - 27, tough as a
bouncer but with a Boy Scout face. From Seekon, Mass.

MURPHY
The leader has a knife wound on his
right hand, pretty deep. Another guy,
he was the youngest, his foot's cut
up - from glass shards.

Murphy and 10 OTHER MAERSK CREW-MEMBERS (we'll meet them
soon) are being debriefed by LT. PRICE, USN.
...as Navy SAILORS take control of this ship. An ENSIGN named
REID at the helm. Murphy can see the Bainbridge from here...
and that tiny orange fiberglass lifeboat. This sucks...

 

MURPHY (CONT'D)
Is there some rescue planned? You
guys gonna get him outta there?

LT. PRICE
Orders are, no offensive measures
until the FBI Negotiator is on sight
and in contact with the pirates.

ENSIGN REID
We okay to come about, Lieutenant?

LT. PRICE
Yeah. Come about.

Reid turns the wheel. The giant cargo ship turns. Murphy
sighs; none of the crew-members look happy. Chief Engineer
MIKE PERRY, (55, devout Christian) voices it:

PERRY
Doesn't feel right, leaving him out
there.

LT. PRICE

Command wants this vessel out of
hostile waters - we're escorting you
all the way to Mobassa.

The men hate that. Murphy studies them... then:

MURPHY
Can we at least get word to his wife?

EXT. UNDERHILL VT. - RIVER ROAD - PHILLIPS' DRIVEWAY - DAY

FOUR NEWSVANS and 15 REPORTERS crowd the snowy driveway and
street outside the home of Richard and Andrea Phillips.

Underhill Vermont is a town with no stop-lights. But today
it's the center of the world, and Phillips is the reason. A
REPORTER, his breath fogged, does a remote from the porch.
...as we PUSH INSIDE, through a window, to:

INT. PHILLIPS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING

An 1830's design, timber ceilings. Messy and warm. But what

used to be a calm home is now Mission Control: NEIGHBORS,
FAMILY MEMBERS - manning phones, monitoring CNN, fretting.

We KEEP PUSHING THROUGH - faces, voices, a spilled soda - to:
EXT. PHILLIPS' HOME - BACK PATIO - DAY

A stone patio, dusted by light snow. ANDREA PHILLIPS sits out
here, a brief moment of solitude amidst crisis. Behind her we
see a perfect Vermont pasture, blanketed white.

Andrea is the one all those reporters want to talk to. The
wife. Lovely, fierce... but desperate just now. She stares at
an old NAUTICAL BELL that hangs over a clothes-line.

Through the patio doors she sees her SISTERS, her SISTERS-IN-
LAW, NEIGHBORS. All here to help. But none of them can.

On her face, fear. Sadness. She lifts a CELL-PHONE to her
ear, hits speed-dial. FOUR RINGS... then she hears:

PHILLIPS (OUTGOING MESSAGE)
You know the spiel. Now do the deal.
I'll call you back.

BEEP. Andrea starts crying. About to hang up... Instead:

ANDREA (INTO CELL)
Hi, Honey. You're gonna have a bunch
of hang-ups on this number. Sorry,
they're all me; it's the only way I
can hear your voice. Dumb, right?
Richard, I keep thinking about the
airport. Dropping you off like that.
I always walk you in and watch the
plane take off. Always. So why didn't
I this time? I don't know.

(a beat)
The kids are good. They're both on
their way home. Everybody's calling,
even people we never talk to, guys I
dated thirty years ago. I think they
think I'm now available.

(half a laugh, then:)
Keep looking for me, Honey. Every
night in the stars. I'm up there. And
I'm looking for you. So I'll see you
soon, right? I love you.

She shuts the phone, eyes that old SHIP'S BELL overhead.

ANDREA (CONT'D)
Damn it!

INT. LIFEBOAT —- MOVING —- RESUMING (NIGHT)

This lifeboat chugs along, airless and fetid.
Phillips, bound now, his face beaten and bruised, silently
prays. Musi, on the bridge, watches, amused.

MUSI
Hey Phillips, you turning Catholic
again?

(NOTE: the bridge is two steps above the lifeboat floor, with
nav and radio gear, two seats, and tiny cockpit windows.)

The pirates look strained, edgy; Elmi nervously works that
three-colored ROPE: weaving strands of white, orange, and red
into a whole. Phillips watches with an unspoken dread.

PHILLIPS
I have to urinate.
(mo one replies)
I need the bottle. I have to urinate.

MUSI
No bottle.
PHILLIPS
You just said...
MUSI
You pee on yourself, like an animal.
PHILLIPS
Won't be too clean.
MUSI
I'm clean. My men are clean. No

bottle.
Two Captains, eyeing one another. The pirates watching...

PHILLIPS
None of us are gonna get out of here
alive. You know that.

MUSI
Why? 'Cause of Navy? Don't worry,
Irish. They not gonna hurt me. I work
for those guys.

PHILLIPS
Is that right?

MUSI
Oh yeah. This is a training mission.
We take ships, see how the Navy does.
Your company hired us. Navy guys and
me, we're friends!
Crazy bastard. He points at the Bainbridge, brightly lit, a
half mile away, then chuckles. Phillips studies him...

MUSI (CONT'D)
We offer them beer! No American say
no to beer! Beer and tv. Lazy, lazy.
We're Somali Marines, we're 24/7. We
can do anything.

Najee picks up the three-colored rope, consults with Elmi
about it in Somali. Clearly, it has great meaning to them.

PHILLIPS
That's for me. Isn't it.
(Musi grins)
The rope. Is it for me?

Musi looks to his men: Do I tell him? A beat, then...
MUSI
Yah, it's for you, Irish. But you
can't touch it. Your hands are lalil.
Unclean.
(relishing this)
It's what we tie you up with before
we kill you. So your soul never
leaves these waters.
Phillips digests that. Musi grins, pleased.
MUSI (CONT'D)
You had to pee, right? So pee! Pee,
Irish!

The pirates laugh. Phillips eyes them, defiant. You will not
break me...

And he begins to pee, darkening his pants.
The pirates start WHOOPING, celebrating, as:
EXT. PHILLIPS' HOME - BACK PATIO - RESUMING
Andrea remains alone out here... until:

AMBER (0.S.)
Andrea?

AMBER, Andrea's oldest friend, stepping on to the patio.

ANDREA
Who's been calling?
AMBER
Matt Lauer, Katie Couric, Diane
Sawyer, Senator Kennedy, Senator
Leahy. But we didn't want to
interrupt you...

ANDREA
You could've interrupted me for Matt
Lauer.

Amber breathes out a smile, then drops a bomb:

AMBER
Honey, there are two people from
Maersk here.

Andrea sees them now, through the patio door: two CORPORATE
TYPES, a man and_a woman, just got here. Standing out like
sore thumbs in a room full of friends and family.

She tightens. Maybe they're here to deliver bad news. Amber
seems to think so too. She leads Andrea into:

INT. PHILLIPS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING

The room is suddenly silent, all eyes on the suits: ALLISON
McCALL (blonde, pretty, likes her BlackBerry) and JONATHAN
HENSON (35, solid). They approach Andrea, who gulps...

ALLISON
Hi, Andrea. I'm Allison McCall. This
is Jonathan Henson. We're from
Maersk.

ANDREA
Okay.

Bracing herself. Everyone in the room doing the same...

ALLISON
I'm going to be managing anything
media-related for you. Jonathan's
going to be liaising with the Defense
Department, so you'll be getting
steady and real-time information.

Okay. She's not here to deliver devastating news. Everyone
relaxes. A sister-in-law, NANCY, extends a phone as:

NANCY
Um. I have the Governor on the phone.
He wants to know if there's anything
he can do.
ALLISON
Yes. He can send over some State
Troopers to move all the reporters
off the road out there. They're
causing a traffic hazard.

Nancy pauses. Am I actually supposed to say that?

ANDREA
I'll be with him in a second, Nancy.

Nancy nods, relieved. Andrea studies Allison, wary.

ANDREA (CONT'D)
I appreciate your being here,
Allison. But it's really not
necessary. I know how things go.
Maersk got their ship back, and all
of their cargo, and most of the crew.
That's a pretty good result. And
sometimes one man gets sacrificed for
the good of others. That's the sea.

ALLISON
Mrs. Phillips, Maersk is not going to
let anything happen to your husband.

ANDREA
I see. Then how much are they willing
to spend to save him?

WHAM. That caught Allison flush. Andrea closes her eyes:

ANDREA (CONT'D)
Richard, you have to save yourself.

INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT

A JOLT: Phillips is yanked out of a _ seat by Musi - suddenly,
urgently. Rage in Musi's eyes. Something's infuriated him:

MUSI
I want you to know something. We were
all fishermen once. Other countries
come and overfish our waters, dump
all their trash here - no Somali
government to stop them. So there's
no more fishing.

A few feet away, Najee and Elmi pull an ORANGE SURVIVAL SUIT
from a bin, and begin to spread it on the floor. Odd...

PHILLIPS
What's the survival suit for?
10.
MUSI
We were fishermen!

PHILLIPS
What's it for?!

MUSI
If your body touch the floor, it
makes the whole boat unclean.
Oh. Musi loads a 9mm handgun, hands it to Bilal. The pirates
drop to their knees to PRAY for Allah's blessing. Game over;
Phillips knows it. And he can only utter a single word:

PHILLIPS
Andrea...

He shuts his eyes. We SMASH TO BLACK - and...
Super: "Eight days earlier."
FADE UP AGAIN: on Phillips, when the world was still sane.

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

 

Phillips is home. In bed. Studying Andrea's face as she
sleeps - trying to sear the image of her into his memory. He
knows he won't be seeing that face again for a while.

This is their bedroom: a four-poster bed, a crucifix on the
wall, timber ceiling overhead. Messy and warm, with Vermont
outside the window - a snowy pasture on a March morning.
Andrea awakens. Phillips is the first thing she sees.
PHILLIPS
(Barry White voice)
Baby, when'll your husband be home?
Andrea blushes, grins. She loves when he kids like that.
Then the grin's gone, that fast - because she just remembered
what today is. Instead, sadness. Resignation. These two love
each other deeply. It makes the goodbyes awful.

ANDREA
All packed?

Phillips nods. We CUT TO... a different kind of home:
INT. MUSI'S HUT - EYL, SOMALIA - EARLY MORNING

Musi awakens on a dirt floor in a stone hut. His wife, ABDI,
and their two kids sleep. He studies them fondly. RETURN TO:
11.

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - UPSTAIRS —- RESUMING

Phillips eyes his daughter's room. (She's away at school).
Every inch of wall space is filled with posters, bumper
stickers, equestrian ribbons. They make him smile.

Then his son's room. Lots of clutter, photos of swimsuit
models on the walls - and the kid himself, just awakening

now. DAN,

A blow-up,

19. Phillips is angered to see him here.

PHILLIPS
Thought you were driving back to
school this morning.

DAN
Yeah. Woke up with a sore throat.

PHILLIPS
(hates being lied to)
Uh-huh. What time'd you get in last

night?
DAN

It wasn't late.
PHILLIPS

Had to be after midnight - 'cause I

was still up and you weren't here.
DAN

You really gonna interrogate me, Dad?
PHILLIPS

Oh. I'm sorry. Are you still sleepy?

(no reply)

It's really simple, Dan. You go to
school. Classes. That's your job.
You're either doing it or you're not.

DAN
Dad, you wanna boss people around? Do
it_on the boat, okay? Jesus.

that fast. Silence hangs...

PHILLIPS
You driving back, or aren't you?

DAN
Obviously.

PHILLIPS
Good. And check in on your mom while
I'm gone.

He HHH OK * + HH

 %
12.

DAN *

I know the drill. *

Lots of distance here. It makes them both uneasy. *
EXT. PHILLIPS HOME - PATIO - SAME *

Andrea brooms snow off the patio, bumping her head on the OLD *
SHIP'S BELL hanging here. Damn. She hates that bell. She sees *
Phillips descending the stairs, irritated, bags in hand. *

INT. MUSI'S HUT - EYL, SOMALIA - RESUMING
Musi's "belongings" lie in a corner, discards collected over

the years: someone's sun-glasses, a chipped coffee mug, a
book. He steps into some ratty sandals.

*

On a stone wall is a sliver of a mirror, too small to reflect
his whole face. He eyes a portion of his own reflection. *

EXT. PHILLIPS HOME - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER *

Toyota Minivan. Andrea gets in. Phillips beside her.

ANDREA

I'm gonna take down that bell.
PHILLIPS

Please don't. It has sentimental--
ANDREA

I keep banging my head on it.
PHILLIPS

I'll raise it, soon as I'm back.
ANDREA

In July.
PHILLIPS

In July.

Not a happy reality. He takes her hand. It helps a little.
She pulls out of the driveway. Phillips looks up:

There's Dan, glancing down from his bedroom window. Father
and son exchange looks. That's it. *

ANDREA
He stayed over so he could see you
off this morning.

PHILLIPS
I don't like him to miss class.
13.

Departure days are always tense. And edgy. We RETURN TO:
INT. MUSI'S HUT - EYL, SOMALIA - RESUMING

Abdi hands Musi a gift, a homemade BRACELET of red cloth. He
smiles, takes it, kisses her. Then he goes...

INT. UNDERHILL, VT. - GENERAL STORE - MORNING

Underhill is snowy pastures, the local cemetery, a handmade
sign for fresh eggs, St. Thomas' Church. And a GENERAL STORE.

It's run by MIKE WILLARD, (60, former merchant mariner), who
grins as Phillips makes his usual pre-trip purchase: 15
pounds of "8 O'Clock Coffee" beans, in bags.

MIKE WILLARD
Where ya bound on this one?

PHILLIPS
Salalah, Djibouti, Mombasa -
delivering handshake food.

MIKE WILLARD
That's a good run.

Andrea tightens. No, it's not a good run. Not lately. And
Willard knows the tension well.

MIKE WILLARD (CONT'D)
Your boy gonna work for me over the
Summer again?

PHILLIPS
Maybe sooner than that, he keeps
screwin' around.
(Willard smiles fondly)
Can I get a receipt?

EXT. VILLAGE - EYL, SOMALIA - MORNING

Musi emerges from his hut... into a wasteland: Eyl, Somalia.
No roads, no power or water. A goat ambles by, an old man
with NO HANDS sits, staring. Musi walks past him.

INT. MINIVAN/EXT. BURLINGTON AIRPORT - CURB - MORNING
Airport. Andrea pulls up to the curb. Phillips pauses.

PHILLIPS
You're not coming in?

ANDREA
I can't today. Late for my shift.

PHILLIPS
Oh. Okay.
He lets it go, gets out. We STAY WITH ANDREA - as Phillips *
grabs his stuff, then walks around to her side of the car - *

just in time for her to blurt out:

ANDREA
Two runs a year, Richard. That was
our deal. This is number three. Is
being away that great?

PHILLIPS
You want the speech about college
tuitions and mortgages again?

ANDREA
I just want you home.

Phillips knows that. He sighs, looks up at the sky.

PHILLIPS
I'll be right up there, like always.
Right?
(she half-nods)
I love you.

He leans in. She pulls him close, urgently, shuts her eyes
tight. Then her guard goes up again. End of hug. He smiles.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
(Barry White voice again)
Thanks, Baby. See ya next time I'm in

town.
She almost laughs. Almost. One last look, then he goes, *
vanishing into the terminal. On Andrea's face we CUT TO: *
EXT. BEACH - EYL, SOMALIA - MORNING *

Musi crosses a wind-whipped beach. No commerce here, no hope, *
just overturned BOATS. To his right is what used to be a FISH
FACTORY - abandoned now, rotting. Musi continues on... *

*

EXT. PORT - SALALAH, OMAN - DAY
Phillips emerges from a car in the port of SALALAH, OMAN.

This place is booming - ships everywhere, big ones... But all
Phillips can see is the Maersk Alabama, ugly and immense. *

Huge CRANES fill her hold with dumpster-sized CONTAINERS.
(She can carry 1,092 of them, but on this trip she'll only be
carrying 400.) She bears no flag of nationality.
15.
Phillips is instantly in Captain-mode: scrutinizing how the
cranes are operating, how the ship's CREW is moving... Then:

MURPHY (0.S.)
Good to see you, Cap.

Shane Murphy, the Chief Mate. These two respect one another.

PHILLIPS
You too, Shane. How's she look?

EXT. EYL, SOMALIA - OLD HARBOR - DOCK - MORNING *

*

We find a beaten TRAWLER with TEN MEN aboard it: black, lean,
hungry. At their feet: AK-47's, side-arms, ammunition. These
men are pirates. This trawler is their MOTHER-SHIP. *

*

*

It has two SKIFFS tied to its stern: motorboats. Not much for
amenities, but fast. The rest of this harbor is empty... *

Musi walks a rickety dock, approaching the pirate-trawler.
THREE CREW-MEMBERS see him coming. They stand at attention.

Bilal. Elmi. Najee. Musi nods to them and boards the Trawler.
EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - IN PORT - DAY

Phillips walks the length of the Maersk, eyeing everything.
He wears a blue Polo shirt, khakis, steel-toed boots.

Behind him is the ship's "House", seven-stories tall, home to *
crew quarters, hospital, mess, engines, the Bridge... *

Before him is the ship's massive HOLD, home to all those
containers, (several marked WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME.) Another
one's being loaded in. Shane Murphy approaches.

MURPHY
Seventeen tons of grain, wheat, and
peas, bound for Kenya.
(Phillips nods)
Beats hauling Toyotas from Yokohama
to Seattle, right? God, that's a

shitty run.
PHILLIPS
Voyage Plan's got us sailing three *
hundred miles off-shore. That's two *
extra days. *
MURPHY

Lotta bulletins comin' in about
pirates last couple weeks, Cap.
Crew's kinda edgy about it. *
16.

PHILLIPS *
Yeah? Then why's security so lax *

around here?

(Murphy shrugs)
Engine Door, Bridge Door, Cargo
Scuttle - all of 'em wide open. I
want ‘em secured. Even in port.

Murphy nods. Phillips eyes the PIRATE CAGES (welded bars)
that are supposed to be protecting the STEPS rising up seven
stories from here to the Bridge. They're unlocked.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Pirate cages unlocked. What kinda
crew are you handing me?

Whoops. That was said just _as TWO CREW-MEMBERS walk by: "ATM" *
RAIZA (26, black) and COLIN WRIGHT (30, Southerner). They *
just decided the new Captain is an asshole. That fast. *
AT™
Cap.
PHILLIPS

Nice to meet you.
Off they go, unimpressed. Murphy waits 'til they're gone.
MURPHY

They're okay. The Captain took his
foot off the gas, last few days.

PHILLIPS
I'm puttin' it back on. Spread the
word.

MURPHY

Cap, go easy. They lost a guy last
week, outside Djibouti.

PHILLIPS
Lost him how?

MURPHY
Deck Machinist, twenty-year vet. Guy
just opted out, middle of the night.
Left a note in his cabin. "Tell 'em I
went for a swim." That shit always
spooks a crew.

PHILLIPS
Sorry, Shane - but I need ‘em un-
spooked. And sharp. You on it?
17.

MURPHY
Yeah.

PHILLIPS
I guess I also need a new Deck
Machinist.

Murphy eyes him, sobered, then nods "On it."
EXT. PIRATE TRAWLER - EYL, SOMALIA - HARBOR - DAY

Musi touches the bracelet his wife gave him as we put to sea.
The Captain of this trawler is an elder named HUFAN. He has
an old map, a radio, and some cigarettes.

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - IN PORT - DAY

The maps in here are electronic. The radar screens have data
scrolling across them. The radios are fed by satellite.

We're 120 feet above the waterline, looking out at the world
through massive windows. A bright, trouble-free day... But
there's a tension hanging, even before we've left port.

At the helm are KEN QUINN (2nd Mate) and ATM Raiza (whom
Phillips pissed off on deck). This is hushed:

AT™
I'm just sayin', Coast Guard
advisories say we should be six
hundred miles off-shore.

KEN QUINN
You think a pirate trawler couldn't
find a ship six hundred miles out?
Murphy, ten feet away, needs to cut this off. So:

MURPHY
Uh-oh. We're screwed, Fellas.

The guys turn... to see a sailor named DURELL (25, black,
fit) who just stepped on to the bridge. Durell freezes.

.»+.as the guys in here study him, like Pledge-Masters.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
This your first ship, Kid? You right

outta merchant mariner school?

DURELL
Yes.

*

+e HF

 %
18.

MURPHY
Aw, Jeez. We got an FNG, Boys.

KEN QUINN
Friggin' New Guy.

MURPHY
Didn't they teach you it's bad luck
to walk on to the Bridge left-foot
first?

Durell's eyes go wide. Murphy looks so serious. They all do.

DURELL
No...?

MURPHY
Write this down, Rook. Full moons and
dolphins - good luck. Priests,
redheads, fresh flowers, and walking
on to the Bridge left-foot first, bad
luck. Brutal. Now go back out and do
it again.

Durell freezes again. Really? He starts to back out...

.».-when ATM and Quinn start laughing, big-time, which tells
Durell it's all a gag. He takes it pretty well. More laughs.

Then Phillips enters - and things tighten. The laughs get
choked back. He's the boss. And not big on goofing off.

MURPHY
Cap, this is Durell, new A.B.

PHILLIPS
Welcome to the sacred fraternity of
merchant mariners, truckers of the
ocean. Shane'll teach you the fight
song later. We all set, Fellas?

MURPHY/KEN QUINN/ATM
Yes sir.

Phillips nods, heads for the coffee-maker.

KEN QUINN
Hey, Cap. I never been on this run
before. Are the ports any good?

MURPHY
Askin' the wrong guy, Kenny. Cap
never leaves the ship. Doesn't matter
where we put in, he stays on board.
19.

KEN QUINN
That right, Cap?

PHILLIPS
I'm married and I'm cheap. What'm I
gonna do on shore?
The guys laugh. Phillips grabs a printed E-MAIL from "The
Office of Naval Intelligence." Subject: "Pirate Activity on
the East African Coast." He eyes it soberly, as:

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Okay then. Dead Slow Ahead.

KEN QUINN
Dead Slow Ahead.

Quinn pushes the ENGINE ORDER TELEGRAPH (throttle), and:
EXT. MAERSK - FROM THE WATER - CONTINUING

The Maersk Alabama puts out to sea... Slow but muscular.
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING

Phillips moves to a computer - sends off a quick e-mail:
"We're underway, Honey. I'll be seeing you in the stars."

.»+.as Murphy eyes that bulletin from Naval Intel - about the
surge in piracy off the East Africa coast...

EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - PIRATE TRAWLER - MOVING - EVENING
Hufan's men eat stale crackers while he monitors his radio.
Musi is thumbing through a weather-worn ENGLISH DICTIONARY,
memorizing words by the glow of a FLASHLIGHT... until he
suddenly tosses the book overboard with disdain. Splash.
BILAL (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Why you do that? All the ships we
board, no captain ever speak Somali.

MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Everybody speaks AK-47, Bilal.

EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - STERN - AT SEA — MORNING

A blazing hot day. Phillips walks the length of the ship
again - his daily inspection tour - when he sees something:

Suspended above B-DECK - right where it should be - is that
fiberglass LIFEBOAT. 28 feet long, enclosed, looks like an
orange submarine, sitting on SKIDS at a 45-degree angle.

*

*
20.

But ten feet below it, sitting on overturned buckets, are two
members of his crew: DEL and DAVE, old salts, each over 60
and overweight, smoking Marlboros.

Phillips pauses, instantly irritated.

PHILLIPS
Enjoying your break, Fellas?

They eye him without alarm. Or chagrin.

DEL
Sorry, Cap. I got a slipped disc.
PHILLIPS
Oh.
(at Dave:)

How're your discs?

(Dave shrugs)
Get to work. Christ. Aren't you guys
supposed to be cleaning the lifeboat?
And there's no smoking on deck.

Del and Dave put their cigs out and rise, grabbing a hose.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
No. Not a hose. Get up in a harness
and soogee it, with a Turk's Head.

DEL
Really?

PHILLIPS
Yep. Hosin' it ain't the same thing.

They eye the lifeboat, suspended above them. Hanging up there
in a harness sounds like a hassle. Phillips turns to go.

DAVE
Hey, Cap.
(Phillips turns back)
We're spittin' distance of the Somali
coast - got pirates takin' down ships
right and left. How's cleanin' a
lifeboat gonna help anything?

Phillips can debate the point, or walk away. He walks away.

PHILLIPS
Just get it done.

INT. MAERSK - MESS DECK - MESS - LATER MORNING

Murphy and Ken Quinn, eating. Phillips enters, irritated.

He HHH HH OF

*

*
21.

PHILLIPS
Got some confused sailors on board,
Shane. They seem to think my name's
Maersk. I'm just the Captain.

MURPHY
You need me to tune somebody up, Cap?

Phillips is about to reply when he sees ANOTHER BULLETIN on
the table: "Worldwide Threats to Shipping".

...it's sitting in front of Ken Quinn. Clearly, he and Murphy
have been discussing it. 23 pirate attacks reported off of
East Africa in a single week.

Now Phillips is really irritated - because a bulletin like
this should NOT be loose on the ship. He grabs it.

PHILLIPS
No. I want you to show our crew a
Goddamn map.

He gestures to a MAP on the wall.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Here's Somalia. Here's Mombasa.
Here's Djibouti. Here's us. Coast
Guard advisories say we should be six
hundred miles off-shore. Great,
except you can't be six hundred miles
away from Somalia if you're going to
Mombasa, because Mombasa is sixty
miles from the Somali border. You can
go a thousand miles straight out, but
you still gotta come back into range,
because that's our destination. And
by the way, these guys've hit ships
twelve-hundred miles off shore, just
like they've hit ships that are at
anchor in port. These are the waters
we're sailing. Okay?

 

Murphy nods. Quinn too. Phillips seems calmer now.

MURPHY
Understood.

PHILLIPS
Good. We're running a security drill
today. Unannounced.

MURPHY
Great! I love unannounced drills.

PHILLIPS
In five minutes.

MURPHY
‘Kay. I wanna start out with--

PHILLIPS
Don't tell me what you're going to
do. Let's just see how we perform.

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - 9 A.M.

Colin Wright is at the helm. Beside him are ATM and a 70 year-
old crew-member named MARV, (white, pleasant, but useless.)
Phillips enters... and leans in to Wright, calmly:

*
*

PHILLIPS
It's Colin, yeah?

WRIGHT
Yes, Cap. Colin Wright.

PHILLIPS
There's a boat on our starboard side,
Colin. Two men with weapons, acting
hostile.

Wright turns. Marv freezes.

WRIGHT
Ohhhhkay.

PHILLIPS
You have to do something about that -
right?

WRIGHT

Is this a drill, Cap?

Phillips just stares: "Show me something." Wright rings the
GENERAL ALARM, which sounds throughout the ship. LOUD.

PHILLIPS
Not the general alarm. We hit the
whistle first - to let the pirates
know you are aware of them and are
ready to defend the ship.

Wright nods, sounds a WHISTLE (audible five miles away).
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)

Now the General Alarm. Long-short,
long-short.
23.

Done. ATM takes the helm. Marv still hasn't moved.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
You are...?

MARV
I'm Marv, Cap.

PHILLIPS
Got pirates approaching, Marv. Hit
the fire pump.

There are two FIRE-PUMP lights on a console. One red, one
green. Marv hits the RED one and moves away.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Red means off. We need it ON.

MARV
Got it.
ATM reaches over him, hits the green button... but:
AT™

The pumps aren't working, Cap. No
water pressure.

PHILLIPS
Okay. Fix it. Marv, go secure the
three bridge doors.

MARV
Got it.

Marv scurries off. Phillips watches him go...

INT. MAERSK - ENGINE ROOM - SAME

Guys file in, without urgency. It's just a drill.

INT. MAERSK - LIFEBOAT - SAME

Whistles and alarms ring, but Del and Dave haven't moved.

DEL
Nice. Can we go now?

DAVE
I'm almost done. Relax.

What's Dave doing? Using a key to scratch a caricature of
Phillips, and the words "Philips is a shit", into a hatch
door. A few last touches, then:
24.
DAVE (CONT'D)
There. Now we can go.
INT. MAERSK - A-DECK - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Phillips emerges from a stairwell: CREW-MEMBERS move past,
some with keys jangling on their belts. There are doors left

unsecured. Not good. He spots a STEWARD, ambling by:

PHILLIPS
What's the non-duress password?

STEWARD
Mister Jones.

PHILLIPS
No. That's the Secret Security Alarm
code. Non-duress is "suppertime."

STEWARD
Suppertime. Got it.

This isn't going well.
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING

Murphy appears on the Bridge. Feeling some heat.

MURPHY
Have we switched the radio to VHF?

WRIGHT
On it.

Just then - Marv returns, winded.

MURPHY
Where you been, Marv?
MARV
Captain sent me to close the doors.
MURPHY
Oh. Which doors did you close?
MARV
Every door on every level.
MURPHY
Did they have locks on them, these
doors?
MARV

Yeah.
Marv goes.

25.

MURPHY

But you were just closing them. Not

locking them. Securing them. *
MARV

Um.... No. Just closing.
MURPHY

Which wouldn't do much good if we
were under attack. Would it?

MARV
No. I guess not.

WRIGHT
I've gone over this with him six or
seven times.

MURPHY
Okay, Marv. Get to your muster point.
(Marv's a blank)
The Ship's Office. Go.

«+» just as Phillips returns to the bridge.

PHILLIPS *
We are in search of excellence - but *
oh we will accept so much less. *
MURPHY *

How's it look down there?

PHILLIPS
Like monkeys trying to hump a
football. Got watertight doors open
on the Main Engine Level; they should
all be secured, with deadbolts. Guys
running around with key-chains on
their hips. One set would give a
pirate access to every room on the
ship. That was in the Night Orders.
Did we get the pump fixed?

MURPHY
Yeah. That's done.

PHILLIPS
Okay. Let's shut this down and bring
everyone into the Ship's Office for a
critique. Five minutes.

MURPHY
‘Kay. Sorry about the screw-ups.
26.

PHILLIPS
Don't be sorry. Be angry. They'll
jump higher.
Murphy nods, shuts off the alarm. Phillips turns away.

...-when something catches his eye. THREE BLIPS - coming from
the 10-cm RADAR SCREEN. Odd.

He stops. Leans in. The BLIPS indicate THREE SMALL VESSELS,
seven miles astern. They're moving in on us. Fast.

Just like they would if this were the real thing. Hmmm..
Phillips grabs a pair of BINOCULARS and heads outside, to:
EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE WING - CONTINUING
He looks through the binoculars, to find:
PHILLIPS' POV - ACROSS WATER - CONTINUING
Two MOTORBOATS pound through FOUR-FOOT SWELLS at 21 knots,
right at_us. A TRAWLER behind them. We can't see faces yet...
But they certainly are moving like pirates would. Real ones.
EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE WING - RESUMING
Phillips lowers the binoculars. Collects himself. Returns to:
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
He moves to the Engine Order Telegraph, leans on it a bit. A
gage tells us his RPM's just shot up to 122 revs. The ship
surges forward. The men notice. He looks to Murphy:
PHILLIPS
Call down to the Engine Room. Tell
‘em to let me know if anything goes

red. I'm increasing our speed.

MURPHY
Cap? We still in the drill?

Phillips is already at a phone, dialing. Two rings, then:

UKMTO OPERATOR (THRU PHONE)
United Kingdom Maritime Trade
Operations.

PHILLIPS (INTO PHONE)
This is the Maersk Alabama - position
is two-degrees-two north by forty-
nine-degrees-nineteen east. Course is
(MORE )
27.

PHILLIPS (INTO PHONE) (cont'd)
one hundred eighty, and speed at
seventeen knots. We have two skiffs
approaching at five-point-five miles,
with a possible mother ship behind

them. Potential piracy situation.

That got everyone's attention. But it's still a drill. Right?

UKMTO OPERATOR (THRU PHONE)
It's probably just fishermen. But you
should get your crew together and get
your fire-hoses ready. And you may
want to get the ship locked up.

PHILLIPS (INTO PHONE)
We understand that, thank you. Will
keep you posted.

MURPHY
Cap?

Phillips hangs up. The men await an answer...

PHILLIPS
Three boats. This is not a drill.

Oh. He dials another number. Hears a ring. Then two.
MURPHY
Never heard of an attack in the
middle of the day, Cap. Visibility's
too good.
PHILLIPS
They aren't here to fish.
(hands him the phone)
Take this. I'm trying to reach the
U.S. Maritime Emergency Line.
Murphy takes the phone. Phillips returns to the Bridge Wing:
EXT. PORT SIDE BRIDGE WING - RESUMING
Another look through the binoculars. More DETAILED now:
The skiffs are getting CLOSER, despite the four-foot SWELLS.
Somalis. With AK-47's. (Musi and his crew aboard one; a
pirate named ASAD and his crew on the other.) In other words:
An actual attack, real pirates, coming at us now.

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Phillips returns - to find SIX SAILORS now staring at him:
28.

Ken Quinn, Durell, and Marv have joined Murphy, Wright, and
ATM on the bridge. They look concerned.

PHILLIPS
Sea's helping us. They're getting
pounded out there. But they are
coming. Two skiffs carrying armed
men. Four miles out and closing.

Murphy lowers the phone.

MURPHY
Twelve rings. There's nobody there.

PHILLIPS
Colin, sound the intruder alarm.

Wright hits the ALARM. Phillips grabs a P.A. MIKE:

PHILLIPS (INTO MIKE)
Captain speaking. This is not a
drill. All crew report back to your
muster points. Repeat, this is not a
drill. Crew to the Ship's Office.
Engineers to the Engine Room. Locked
up and sealed in. Now.

(lowers mike)

Shane, let's go to hand steering.
Left fifteen.

MURPHY
Left fifteen...

EXT. MAERSK - AFT - BELOW THE WATERLINE - CONTINUING

Giant TWIN TILLERS move fifteen degrees right, pushing the
ship left - and creating a swell in its wake.

EXT. MUSI'S SKIFF - MOVING - AT SEA - SAME

Musi's skiff SLAMS into a swell. He adjusts his course. To
his right, Asad's skiff does the same. Zeroing in...

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Phillips watches the radar screen. BLIPS moving in.

PHILLIPS
Right fifteen.

MURPHY
Right fifteen.

The ship surges starboard. Phillips grabs the ship's RADIO:
29.

PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
Chief, how we doing on engines?

MIKE PERRY. We met him already - eight days ago.

PERRY (THRU RADIO)
We're good, Cap.

PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
Increasing speed to 124 revs.

PERRY (THRU RADIO)
No problem.

Phillips pushes the Engine Order Telegraph forward.

MURPHY
They're at three miles, Cap.

WRIGHT

A lotta chop out there. Don't they

know there's a lotta chop out there?
Phillips eyes the radar again. We CUT TO:
INT. MUSI'S SKIFF - SAME
Musi bears down on the Maersk, his face a stone.
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - MINUTES LATER (MORNING)
Murphy looks up from the radar. But Phillips already knows:

MURPHY
Two miles, Cap.

PHILLIPS
Send out a call to "War Ship 237."
I'll pretend to get it.

MURPHY
Huh?

PHILLIPS
Forget it. I'll do it.

He grabs the radio, speaks into it:
PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
Warship 237, Coalition Warship 237.
This is Maersk Alabama, come in.

Then he changes his voice, pretending to be "Warship 237":
30.

PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO, CONT'D)

("warship voice")
Maersk Alabama, come in. This is
Coalition Warship 237.

(normal voice: )
This is Maersk Alabama. Position is
two-degrees-two north by forty-nine-
degrees-eighteen east. Course is one
hundred eighty and speed at eighteen
knots. Request immediate assistance.
We have two skiffs approaching and a
mother ship trailing behind. Look to
be pirates, heavily armed.

("warship voice")
Roger that, Maersk Alabama. How many
do you have aboard?

(normal voice: )
Crew of twenty. No injuries at this
time.

("warship voice")
Roger that. We have a helicopter in
the air. His ETA to your position is
approxiamately five minutes.

(normal voice)
Copy that, 237. Maersk out.

He puts the radio down. Murphy and Quinn eye him.

MURPHY
I'm pretty sure that was illegal.

PHILLIPS
So's piracy...

EXT. PIRATE TRAWLER - SAME

On the mother ship, Hufan just heard that fake transmission.
He eyes the sky overhead for a chopper, as:

EXT. MUSI'S SKIFF - MOVING - AT SEA - SAME

CRASH! Musi's skiff slams into a huge swell, almost upending.
His crew is sent sideways. Musi rights himself.

...then notices that Asad's skiff is now peeling off and
heading away. (Asad also heard that fake transmission, via
HANDHELD RADIO.) Musi's crew-members look to him, waiting.

 

He presses on, bearing down on the Maersk...
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - SAME

Phillips is watching all this. Murphy's at the radar.
31.

PHILLIPS
This guy doesn't scare worth a damn,
does he.
(into radio:)
Chief, you got your men secured?

PERRY (THRU RADIO)
We're good, Cap.

MURPHY
They're at one mile now, Cap.

PHILLIPS
Hit the hoses.

EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - STERN - CONTINUING

FIVE FIRE HOSES - one starboard, one port, three stern - fill
quickly, each sending 100 pounds of water-pressure per square
inch off the ship. It's their only real line of defense...

EXT. MUSI'S SKIFF - MOVING - AT SEA - RESUMING

Musi's got a six foot SWELL in front of him. His men brace
themselves. He barrels right over it, then PLUMMETS...

Big DROP. Big splash. The skiff's engine stalls. Musi tries
to restart it. No luck. More swells are coming. He looks to
the Maersk - its hoses shooting HUGE JETS of water down...
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING

Phillips watching Musi. Murphy watching the radar...

MURPHY
Holding at zero point nine, Cap.

PHILLIPS
He started from too far out. They
dropped him too far out.

Through binoculars again, we see Musi, trying in vain to re-
start his engine. No use. The skiff is adrift...

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
He's dead in the water.

MURPHY/KEN QUINN
Hell yeah! Awesome. See ya!

Phillips looks through his binoculars again.

Musi has binoculars too. Two captains, studying one another -
with a shared sense that they'll be seeing each other again.
32.

PHILLIPS
We got lucky...

Each Captain lowers his binoculars... as we CUT TO:
INT. MAERSK - A-DECK - MESS - NIGHT

A silent game of TRIVIAL PURSUIT. Murphy, Durell, ATM, Colin
Wright, Mike Perry. Guys trying to distract themselves.

But Durell is kicking all of their asses in the game...

WRIGHT
You gotta be kidding me. Where'd you
pull "The Treaty of Paris" out of?

DURELL
College.

MURPHY
Hey, ya know those things that could
bring a ship bad luck? Guess what the
worst one is? The Friggin' New Guy
winning Trivial Pursuit. Seriously.

DURELL
Sorry.

INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Spacious quarters. Phillips reads an E-MAIL from Andrea:

"It snowed again today. I keep thinking how much you love
that. And every morning I wake up on your side of the bed. So
I must be missing you. Yes, definitely missing you. Miss your
voice. And I miss those great long LETTERS you used to write
to me when you were gone. E-mail stinks. Love you. Andrea."

Phillips breathes out a smile, looks out his window - a sky
full of stars. Then he STOPS. Just heard a BANGING noise.

It's outside his door. He opens the door to investigate:
INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUING

Here's the source of the noise: Marv. Slumped against a
bulkhead, bottle in hand. Very drunk. Phillips sighs.

 

PHILLIPS
Marv. What're you doing?

MARV
Trying to find my bunk.

+e HH OH + FH HHH *

PHILLIPS
No. I mean on this ship. You should
be home collecting a pension and
raising gardenias.

MARV
And miss all this?
(drunken amusement)
"Being at sea is like going to jail
with a chance of drowning." Mark
Twain.

He gestures wildly, shattering his bottle. Silence...

MARV (CONT'D)
Am I done?

PHILLIPS
Yeah. You're done. You can't sail
with me anymore.

MARV
Guess I'll get another ship then.

PHILLIPS
You do that.

Phillips turns to go... but:

MARV

By the way... his name was Sam.
PHILLIPS

Huh?
MARV

The Deck Machinist who opted out...
His name was Sam. Four kids he sent
money home to, and an ex-wife. Who
takes care of them now, huh?
(Phillips is silent)
Ship keeps sailing, I know; he was
replaceable. But it woulda been nice
if you'd at least asked his name.

 

Marv turns to go - then stops, confused. Where am I going?

PHILLIPS
B-Deck. Berth Two. Ya need a map?

INT. MAERSK - A-DECK - MESS —- RESUMING

The Trivial Pursuit game - the guys trying to forget the
day's events... Then Phillips enters.

He HH OH HH

And everyone tightens again. He notes it.

PHILLIPS
Who's winning?

KEN QUINN
Friggin' New Guy.

PHILLIPS
Aw, Jeez. Didn't they tell you that
was bad luck?

Tight laughs. Phillips grabs a coffee... the unease in here
going unaddressed... until:
AT™

Ya think they'll try again, Cap?
There it was. Phillips pauses. The guys await an answer.

PHILLIPS
Most likely, yeah.

PERRY
And, uh... That gonna be the program
again? Evasive maneuvers?

PHILLIPS
That's the book. Why?

PERRY
I didn't much like being outgunned.

PHILLIPS
Me neither. But they have weapons and
we don't. So evasion's all we got.

PERRY
Then maybe we should have weapons.

A few guys nod. Clearly, it's been discussed in here tonight.

PHILLIPS
Sorry. The guys who own this ship
disagree, and they sign the checks.

AT™
I don't get that, Cap. None of us do.

PHILLIPS
Ships start carrying guns, pirates
are going to come back with mortars.
We start carrying depth charges,
pirates are going to come back with
(MORE )
35.

PHILLIPS (cont'd)
rocket-launchers. Besides that, there
are ports on this run that won't
allow an armed ship to dock.

PERRY
Careful, Cap. You're starting to
sound like a suit.

AT™
Did have a corporate ring to it.

Phillips looks to Murphy, who looks away: "Can't help you."

PHILLIPS
If the hoses don't keep them away,
we've got flares, pikes, axes,
hatchets. We can gel the decks or
wire the stairways.

MURPHY
That's bringing a stick to a
gunfight, Cap.

PHILLIPS
Hey, we get in a gunfight and lose,
we could have twenty sailors killed
or captured - huh? You all know the
orders. If we're boarded, the crew
gets to their muster points and we go
dark and cold. Power off. Lights off.
And we stay that way. Our performance
today was embarrassing. And by the
way, the non-duress codeword is
"suppertime." Half the crew still
doesn't know it. Unless you hear it,
you stay sequestered. No one on this
crew is going to be taken hostage.

AT™
Somebody's trying to hijack a ship,
it goes against a sailor's nature to
run and hide. We're men, ain't we?

This isn't going anywhere good. Phillips reads the faces.
.--and decides to stop pushing the company line.

PHILLIPS
You guys wanna know the truth?
(they're waiting)
The truth is, I don't feel any better
about the hoses than you do. I wish
we had machine guns. But I don't own
this vessel. And I'm not in the game.

+ HH HH
36.

PHILLIPS (cont'd)

(that landed)
You wanna change the rules? Buy a
shipping line. Until then, this is
the job. We're here for the ship; the
ship isn't here for us. Anybody who
can't accept that can deboard at
Mombasa. I won't think any less of
you.

Silence. No one replies. But he just gained some respect...

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Let's shut this down. It's late.
(out the door)
We're still in apache country, so
everyone stay vigilant.

EXT. MAERSK - FROM THE WATER - NIGHT
The Maersk muscles through the water. All is calm...
EXT. PIRATE TRAWLER - ON THE WATER - MOVING - NIGHT

The two SKIFFS are tied to the trawler again. Musi and Asad
stand before Hufan, who looks very displeased... then:

HUFAN (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
The voices on that ship sounded
American. Could be a lot of money.
And we only have one skiff.
(Musi and Asad, waiting--)
Musi will take it.

ASAD (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Why?

HUFAN (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Because he doesn't turn back.

Then - BAM - Hufan shoves Asad off the boat and into the sea.
Splash. No one moves - everyone shocked, even Musi - because
the boat is pulling away. Asad calls out to Musi for help.
Musi is frozen, watching - as Hufan goes to the bridge and
GUNS THE ENGINE. The trawler speeds away, leaving Asad in the
water. Howling. A point just got made.

And Asad's helpless cries grow more and more distant... as:
INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - 5:25 A.M.

Pre-dawn. Phillips sleeps.

Then his eyes snap open - right before his phone rings:

PHILLIPS (INTO PHONE)

WRIGHT (THRU PHONE)
Better get up here, Cap. They're
back.
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - 5:30 A.M.
Colin Wright and ATM are on watch. Phillips enters.
«+.Just as a VOICE becomes audible on the RADIO:
HUFAN (THRU RADIO)
This is Somali pirate! Somali pirate!

Coming to get you!

A pirate? Announcing that he's coming? Very unusual. Phillips
looks to the radio; it's on Channel 16.

WRIGHT
They're five miles out.
Phillips grabs his binoculars... and finds the TRAWLER, five
miles astern, towing those two skiffs... but:

HUFAN (THRU RADIO)
Somali pirate! Coming to get you!

...as Musi's skiff casts off from the trawler, coming at us.

 

PHILLIPS
Let's go to one hundred twenty revs.

AT™
One hundred twenty revs.

PHILLIPS
What's our course?

AT™
Heading two hundred thirty.

PHILLIPS
Bring it over to one-eighty.

AT™
Left to one hundred eighty.

A flick of the wrist, and the ship lurches left. Phillips
keeps his eyes on the trawler.

.»+.-as Murphy arrives on the bridge.
38.

MURPHY
We make a course correction, Cap?
PHILLIPS
Find out where the Bosun has his
people.
MURPHY
What's up?
PHILLIPS

Four point one miles astern. Doing
twenty knots.

Phillips gestures... and Murphy gets the picture: there's
Musi's skiff, barrelling in on us over a calm, windless sea.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Call UKMTO, tell ‘em this is not a
drill.

Movement, tension. Phillips grabs the ship's phone:

PHILLIPS (INTO PHONE)
Chief, we're in a piracy situation. I
need you in the engine room with all
your men. Locked in and secured.
(a beat)
And, Chief. Bring your Bible. This
time you're gonna be there a while.

He hangs up, heads for a cabinet, pulls out a PYROTECHNIC
BOX. Eighteen FLARES in there. He grabs ten of them.

MURPHY
(re: radio)
He says call back when they're within
a mile.

PHILLIPS
Christ. Leave the line open so they
can monitor what's happening. Sound
the intruder alarm, and switch the
radio to emergency band, Channel One.

Murphy sounds the INTRUDER ALARM. Long-short, long-short.
Phillips eyes the console. We're doing 16.8 knots.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
ATM, let's start the fire-hoses and
sound the general alarm.

ATM hits the GENERAL ALARM. Phillips approaches Wright with
the flares.

*
39.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)

Take these and go out on the bridge
wing. When they get within a mile you
fire your first one. But I want you
to cease firing if they get any
closer than a couple hundred yards.

MURPHY
I can handle that, Cap.

PHILLIPS
No. I want you below. Get the crew
out of the Ship's Office and into the
After-Steering Room. It's deeper
inside the house. And make sure all
the engineers are locked into the
Engine Room. Every man accounted for.

MURPHY
Okay.

PHILLIPS
And Shane? That includes you. I don't
wanna see you back up here.
Murphy hates that... but he nods, exits the Bridge.
EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - SAME
The FIVE FIRE-HOSES begin spraying...
EXT. MUSI'S SKIFF - ON THE WATER - MOVING - RESUMING
Musi's skiff is doing 21 knots. He shouts at his men:
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Let them know you are here! Let them
know you are Somali marines!
EXT. MAERSK - STARBOARD SIDE BRIDGE-WING - SAME
Wright aims a flare at the skiff, a half-mile out, when:
MUZZLE FLASHES appear on the skiff. And just like that, we're
being strafed by automatic gunfire. SLAP-SLAP-SLAP. Bullets
clang off the house and smokestacks. Wright hits the deck.
.»+-as Phillips leans out of the bridge.

PHILLIPS
Colin! Get the hell in here!

WRIGHT
I can hit 'em, Cap!
40.
PHILLIPS
Now!
Wright hurries into:
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
ATM at the helm. Phillips grabs the ship's radio:
PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
Shots fired. Shots fired. They're a

quarter mile out. Port side.

A rain of bullets: POP-POP-POP. Hitting various spots on the
House. Musi's skiff revs up and comes BEHIND THE SHIP.

 

WRIGHT
The hoses aren't gonna cut it. Are
they, Cap?

PHILLIPS

No.
(into radio:)
Shane, you got everybody secured?

On Phillips, we PULL BACK, through the window of the bridge:

.+-while TRACKING RIGHT and DROPPING DOWN, outside the
"house"... until Phillips is out of frame, and:

EXT. MAERSK - OUTSIDE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS SHOT

We move down and across the entire House, PUSHING THROUGH its
steel shell, revealing the innards of:

E-Deck, then down through D-Deck, C-Deck, B-Deck... each
empty, just unmanned Quarters. CONTINUE MOVING DOWN, into:

A-Deck, where we find the Mess, and the Hospital Bay. Then
the MAIN DECK. There's the Ship's Office, also empty.

We keep descending, THROUGH THE WATERLINE, plunging in and
down, until we reach:

INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM —- CONTINUING

A STORAGE room, 60-by-20. Huge bundles of rope in coils. And
barrels of greases, oils, cleaning fluids.

Murphy guides TEN CREW-MEMBERS in, hurriedly. We recognize
Ken Quinn, Durell. Murphy corralling them:
41.

MURPHY
In, in, in! Let's go! Everybody in!
Ken, get me a headcount.
(into radio:)
Chief. Your men all accounted for?
We blow through a steel door - SAME CONTINUOUS SHOT - to:
INT. MAERSK - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING

The ENGINE ROOM is three stories deep, 130 feet long, wide as
the ship. Massive diesel engine, huge boilers, all run from:

INT. MAERSK - ENGINE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUING
A nerve center. Rows of upright machines and monitors.

Chief Engineer Mike Perry and his men are all here: the 1ST
ENGINEER, 2ND ENG., 3RD ENG., OILER, and DECK MACHINIST.

 

PERRY (INTO RADIO)
We're in and secured.

BIBLE in hand, Perry shuts the door. We END SHOT, and CUT TO:
EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE-WING - SAME

The skiff is now just 100 feet away, on our port side. And
Phillips is now on the bridge-wing, firing flares at it.

EXT. MUSI'S SKIFF - ON THE WATER - MOVING - SAME

Two flares miss, falling harmlessly into the water. Bilal
sits cross-legged in the front of the skiff, grabs his AK,
aims right at us, and:

EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE-WING - RESUMING

POP POP POP. Bullets pucker the WIND-DODGER (a metal hood,
there to deflect wind off the bridge) over Phillips' head.

He ducks down. Then pops back up again.

PHILLIPS
C'mon, Baby. Find a gas tank.

He FIRES the flare, but:
EXT. MUSI'S SKIFF - ON THE WATER - MOVING - RESUMING

The flare misses. Now Elmi, also cross-legged, is firing too.
42.

EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE-WING - RESUMING

Gunfire - a TORRENT of POPPING SOUNDS around Phillips. And
he's out of flares. He runs back into:

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Phillips, hollering:

PHILLIPS
Fifteen left!

AT™
Fifteen left.

EXT. MAERSK - AT THE WATERLINE - CONTINUING
The ship surges left, away from the skiff.

.--but the skiff has found a spot amidship that isn't
protected by the fire-hoses. Musi bears in...

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Phillips looks to the GPS. We're doing 18.3 Knots.

PHILLIPS
Fifteen right!

AT™
Fifteen right.

EXT. MAERSK - AT THE WATERLINE - AMIDSHIP - CONTINUING

The ship swerves right into the skiff. But Musi steadies it.
Again, there's no fire-hose covering this spot.

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
Phillips, scrambling.
PHILLIPS
I need a rifle. We should have

Goddamn rifles! Fifteen left.

AT™
Fifteen left. And yes we should.

EXT. MUSI'S SKIFF - AT THE WATERLINE AMIDSHIP - SAME

Najee unfolds and extends a LADDER straight up. Damn thing is
twenty feet long, Home Depot quality, with GRAPPLING HOOKS:
43.

INTERCUT WITH/EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE DECK - CONTINUING

The GRAPPLING HOOKS wrap snugly around the FISHPLATE (solid
metal, six inches high) on the deck of the Maersk.

Musi grabs the ladder while moving at 18 knots. He jumps from. *
the speeding skiff to the ladder, climbing...

 

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Phillips grabs ATM, pushes him down, literally, to the floor.

PHILLIPS
Stay there.

ATM doesn't argue. He'll steer the boat from down here.
Phillips grabs the rest of the flares, heads out to:

 

EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE-WING - CONTINUING
...where he sees what he didn't want to see:

EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - AMIDSHIP - CONTINUING
Musi is aboard. Running across the Maersk's deck...
EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE-WING - RESUMING

Phillips fires two more flares... They skitter off the deck
and into the sea as Elmi also boards the Maersk.

PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
Two pirates have boarded. Two pirates
aboard now, amidship.

Oddest thing. Elmi sits cross-legged on the deck, just like
before, and starts firing his AK, right at us. POP-POP-POP.

The wind-dodger puckers an inch from Phillips' face.

He ducks down. Pops up again, firing wildly. MORE GUNFIRE
drives him down again. Then:

A HAND, grabbing him. It's ATM, pulling him away.

AT™
Get inside, Cap! They're gonna kill
you!

PHILLIPS
Goddammit I told you to stay down! On
the bridge!

But more GUNFIRE strafes them. Shit. They crawl back to:
44,

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE —- CONTINUING

GUNFIRE nicks the BRIDGE WINDOWS. (They're bulletproof).
Wright is trying to stay calm. It's an effort.

WRIGHT
Whadda we do, Cap?

PHILLIPS
You two get to the After-Steering
Room with the rest of the crew.
(they eye him: huh?)
Go. Both of you. I have the bridge.

AT™
Sorry, Cap.

WRIGHT
Can't do that, Cap.

They aren't moving. Phillips isn't surprised. We CUT TO:
EXT. MAERSK - DECK - BASE OF THE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

All that stands between Musi and the bridge is seven flights
of steps - protected by that steel "PIRATE CAGE".

He nods to Elmi, who SHOOTS THE LOCK OFF THE CAGE. The cage
swings harmlessly to the side. Easy. They begin to climb.

INT. MAERSK —- BRIDGE —- RESUMING

Phillips knows they're coming. Damn it. He grabs the radio.
(NOTE: it will stay on his hip for the next 12 hours.)

PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
This is the Captain. Listen up.

INTERCUT WITH/INT. MAERSK - ENGINE CONTROL ROOM - SAME
Perry and his Engineers come to a stop. And one room over:
INTERCUT WITH/INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - SAME
Murphy and the rest of the crew do the same, listening.

PHILLIPS (RADIO, CONT'D)
We're about to lose the bridge.
Chief, you now have control of the
ship. Shane, the men are under your
command. I've got Colin and ATM on
the bridge with me; I'm going to get
them to safety as soon as I can.
Everyone else accounted for?
45.

PERRY (INTO RADIO)
Yes, Cap.

MURPHY (INTO RADIO)
Uh, no Cap. We don't have a twenty on
Marv.

Phillips sighs - but has to keep going:

PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
Okay. You know the plan. We
counteract everything they want to
do. They wanna take this ship back to
Somalia. That's no good. So we go
dark and cold. Engines off, non-
emergency power off. They can't do
much with a dead ship. They wanna
take a bunch of hostages. Also no
good. So every man stays out of
sight. NO ONE comes out until you've
heard the all-clear from me, WITH the
non-duress password.

INTERCUT WITH/EXT. MAERSK - SUPERSTRUCTURE - STEPS - SAME
Musi and Elmi, climbing fast toward the Bridge...
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Phillips can feel them coming. And he hates to say this, but:
PHILLIPS (INTO RADIO)
I'm gonna do everything I can to make
sure this doesn't happen - but if
they find you, and capture you,
here's what you need to remember:
That lands on the faces of Murphy and the crew...
And - in the next room - Perry, and all the Engineers, as:
EXT. MAERSK - SUPERSTRUCTURE - STEPS - SAME
Musi and Elmi, nearing the top...
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Phillips, keeping it calm and direct:
PHILLIPS (RADIO, CONT'D)
Do what they tell you. Try to appear
helpful. You've got giveaways - use
them: showing them the ship's safety

equipment, or how to get fresh water.
(MORE )
46.

PHILLIPS (RADIO, CONT'D) (cont'd)
Make them feel they're in control
while guiding them away from the
important stuff, like radar or the
engine controls. And never reveal the
locations of the rest of the crew. If
you are drawn into conversation with
them, do not mention religion.
Nothing about Allah or Jesus or your
faith being better than theirs. They
may throw politics at you or tell you
America is the worst country in the
world. Don't take the bait. You're
not there to defend your nation's
honor. You're there to survive.

 

The guys are listening. The pirates are climbing...

PHILLIPS (RADIO, CONT'D)
Don't call attention to yourself.
Don't appear too confrontational or
too meek. Maintain your dignity. If
you're screaming at them or
whimpering in the corner, you give
them a personal reason to put a
bullet in your head.

Murphy, Durell, Wright, Perry... hanging on every word...

PHILLIPS (RADIO, CONT'D)
Last thing. A sense of humor helps.
Unfortunately, none of you guys are
funny - so try not to get captured.

That broke a bit of the tension. But just a bit.
PHILLIPS (RADIO, CONT'D)
We know the ship; they don't. Just
keep looking out for one another.
We'll be okay.

He puts down the radio. ATM and Wright are silent. He grabs a *
JACKKNIFE off a table, pockets it... *

.»+-as the sound of an AK-47, firing, spins our head around.

The bridge-door opens - Elmi rushing in, pointing that AK at
us and shouting in Somali like a guy on a meth-bender.

Instant chaos. ATM and Wright drop to their knees, hands up.
Phillips stands still. He has lost the bridge, officially.

Elmi shouting. ATM and Wright scared witless. Musi glides in -
meeting Phillips for the first time now:
47.

MUSI
Relax, Captain, relax. Just business.
No Al Qaeda. You stop the ship.

Phillips nods. Musi looks the bridge over, notes Wright and
ATM - shocked to find a black sailor here.

MUSI (CONT'D)
What nationality?

PHILLIPS
Me? Or the ship?

MUSI
The ship. American, right?

PHILLIPS
Yes. This is the Maersk Alabama.

That's BIG NEWS. Musi nods, pleased. Elmi WHOOPS.

MUSI
Okay. Just business. Stop the ship.

Phillips nods, heads toward the ENGINE ORDER TELEGRAPH, while
quietly keying his handheld radio and talking softly:

PHILLIPS
Bridge is compromised. Bridge is
compromised. Take the steering.
INT. MAERSK - ENGINE CONTROL ROOM - SAME

Perry and his Engineers just heard that. Perry hits a SWITCH
that gives him OVERRIDE OF THROTTLE AND RUDDER COMMANDS.

INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - SAME
Murphy speaks to his men (and into his radio):
MURPHY
Okay. You know what to do. Kill the
engines and all non-emergency power.
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Alarms are WHOOPING. Phillips silences them. Musi watching.
MUSI
No Al Qaeda, no Al Qaeda. We want
money only. Stop the ship.

PHILLIPS
Okay, okay. It takes a minute.
48.

MUSI
Where's your crew?

PHILLIPS
I don't know. I'm here with you.

He moves to the Engine Order Telegraph. Jiggles it. Of
course, it doesn't respond. Musi is about to complain, when:

..-with a SHUDDER, the thrum of the ship's engine STOPS.

 

Then, that fast, the POWER GOES OUT. Consoles, screens, A/C.
All dead. And we're adrift. Musi looks around.

MUSI
What is that?

PHILLIPS
We shut the engines down too fast.
(pure bullshit)
There's a check-down procedure. We
rushed it, knocked out the grid.

That pisses Musi off. Meanwhile, the ship is drifting with
the current, almost in a circle.

MUSI
Stop this circling! Straighten the
ship out!
Phillips "tries", turning the wheel, to no effect.
PHILLIPS
We shut it all down too fast! Ship's
broken, ship's broken.

He points to the console, taps on the bow thruster and the
rudder angle indicator. None of them respond.

MUSI
Move.

Phillips obliges. Musi tries the instruments, futilely, as:
Phillips moves to the RADAR. Three knobs on it. He turns down
the "gain" knob and turns up the "anti-rain" and "anti-sea-
clutter" knobs. Then he moves toward the VHF radio...

INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - SAME

EMERGENCY LIGHTING down here - but Murphy can see what
Phillips is doing on INDICATORS relayed from the Bridge.
49.
MURPHY
Attaboy, Cap.

KEN QUINN
What's he doing?

MURPHY
Degrading the radar. And changing the
frequency on the radio so they won't
be able to contact their mother ship.
The men like it. But they're getting warm in here. No A/C...
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING

Bilal and Najee arrive on the bridge now. Shouting, pointing
their AK's. Musi smiles.

 

MUSI
These guys are Somali pirates! Crazy.
I'm just interpreter.
(no reply from Phillips)
Dangerous guys! They'll kill you!

ATM and Wright keep their hands up and their heads down. Musi
orders Bilal and Najee to take positions by the bridge doors.

MUSI (CONT'D)
Call your crew. I want them up here!

PHILLIPS
Okay.

Phillips moves to the P.A. MIKE:
PHILLIPS (INTO MIKE)
All crew, all crew. Pirates want you
to report to the bridge. Repeat,
pirates want you on the bridge.
INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - RESUMING
Semi-darkness down here. And HEAT. Murphy eyes the men.
MURPHY
Until you hear the word suppertime,
we don't move.

INT. MAERSK —- BRIDGE —- RESUMING

Elmi pokes at Wright and ATM with his AK. Phillips steps in:
50.

PHILLIPS
Hey, do your guys want some water? Or
some cigarettes? I got a couple
cartons here.

MUSI
Cigarettes.

Phillips heads for a cabinet, grabs a few cartons.

PHILLIPS
ATM, grab some sodas for these guys,
all right?

AT™

Sure, Cap.

Phillips hands packs of cigarettes to Musi and his men. ATM
grabs a few sodas, offers them to the pirates. Elmi ignores
him, starts rifling through cabinets.

PHILLIPS

Hungry?

(Elmi grunts)
You're in luck. We've got seventeen
tons of wheat and peas in the hold.
It was intended to feed most of
Kenya, but what the hell - go to
town.

Elmi didn't like that. Phillips sits beside Wright.

WRIGHT
(quietly)
Cap, how much ya got in your safe?

PHILLIPS
Less than they want.

WRIGHT
But a couple grand, right? Maybe we
give it to 'em and they go away.

PHILLIPS
It's a U.S. ship, Colin. They're
thinking millions - not thirty grand.

WRIGHT
How do you know?

Phillips just knows. Meanwhile Musi leans over the radio,
trying to re-set it, careful not to let his frustration show.
51.

MUSI
What's your tribe, Captain?

PHILLIPS
I'm an American.

MUSI
Not your nationality. Your tribe.

PHILLIPS
I don't have a tribe. I told you. I'm
an American.

MUSI
Your people. Your tribe.

PHILLIPS
Oh. I guess I'm Yankee Irish.

MUSI
I'm a Somali Marine. A real sailor.

The ship is still drifting in a circle. And Musi just ERUPTS:

MUSI (CONT'D)
Where is your crew, Irish?

PHILLIPS
I don't know. I'm here with you.

MUSI
Get them up here now! If not, these
crazy-guys kill you!

Bilal and Najee jump as if they'd been plugged into a socket:
shouting again, pointing the AK's:

BILAL/NAJEE
Down! Down!

ATM and Wright drop their heads, the AK's pressed inches away
from them now. Things just ramped up in a hurry.

MUSI
You want to die! Two minutes, they
kill you! They kill your men!

PHILLIPS
Take it easy. I'm doing my best.

NAJEE
Minute thirty now!
52.

MUSI
I told you! Bad guys! Bad guys!

Wright looks to Phillips, who moves again to the P.A. MIKE.
All he has to say is "suppertime" and the crew will oblige...

PHILLIPS (INTO MIKE)
All crew, all crew. Pirates want you
on the bridge now. Report to the
bridge immediately.

NAJEE
One minute! We kill everyone!

PHILLIPS
Can you back your men off, please?
Before someone gets shot?

MUSI
Get them up here right now!

Wright, terrified, looks to Phillips - pleading...
PHILLIPS (INTO MIKE)
Pirates want you on the bridge, right
now.
NAJEE
Thirty seconds! You hear me! Thirty
seconds and you DIE!
INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - SAME

Then men know to stay put. But it's now 105 DEGREES in here.
Del, the old salt, is panting from heat stroke.

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING
Wright is about to burst. ATM too.

NAJEE
Fifteen seconds!

MUSI
Dangerous pirates! Get your men!

PHILLIPS
You just heard me call ‘em!

ATM and Wright, each with guns at their heads...

NAJEE
Ten seconds!
53.
MUSI
Call them again, Irish!
PHILLIPS
Hey. You wanna shoot somebody, shoot

me. I'm the Captain. I'm the Captain.

He moves in front of his men. Elmi pushes him away, hard.
Phillips falls. While he's down, he keys his handheld:

PHILLIPS (INTO HAND-HELD)
If you don't hear from us in one
minute, we are gone. Defend the ship.

NAJEE
Five seconds!

WRIGHT
Cap? Please!?

NAJEE
We kill you all!

Najee yells. Elmi and Bilal too. Deafening. Wright starts
yelling out of sheer terror.

..-when a single unexpected sound pierces the air.
A knock, at the bridge door.

Everything stops. Every head turns. Musi nods to Phillips:
"Go open it." Phillips crosses to the door, opens it. Sighs.

..-because it's Marv. Of course. Right where he shouldn't be.
Phillips can hardly believe it.

 

MARV
Cap?

PHILLIPS
C'mon in, Marv. You're dead.

Before Marv can reply, Elmi grabs him by the collar and puts
him on the ground next to ATM and Wright.

But the crisis, oddly, has passed. Musi eyes Phillips:

MUSI
Let's go. We search the ship.

PHILLIPS
For what?
54.

MUSI
Your crew.

Phillips discreetly keys his radio, so this'll be broadcast:
PHILLIPS
You wanna search the ship? Good. I'm
eager to find those guys as you are.
Musi pushes Phillips to the door, nods to Bilal.
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
You too. Bring your gun. And that
flashlight.
INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - SAME
Murphy heard that. He heads for a steel door.

MURPHY
Everybody stay put.

INT. MAERSK —- BRIDGE —- RESUMING

So Najee and Elmi will be left here with Wright, ATM, and
Marv. Phillips pauses at the door:

PHILLIPS
I want your assurance that my men
won't be harmed in any way.

Musi pauses, breathes out a grin... then says something to
Najee and Elmi in Somali. They nod. Then:

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
What'd ya tell ‘em?

MUSI
Go.

He nudges Phillips out the door.
INT. MAERSK - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING

Emergency lighting. Perry and his FOUR MEN (all in their 50's
and 60's), are sweltering in here. Murphy enters.

MURPHY
Did you hear that?

PERRY
Yeah. Sounds like two of 'em are
coming, and Cap.
55.

MURPHY
Way too much light down here; they're
gonna find us. We gotta shut down the
emergency power.

JOHN CRONAN
That generator's on the deck, Shane.

That's JOHN CRONAN, First Engineer. In his 40th year at sea.
MURPHY
His orders were we go dark and cold,
right?

JOHN CRONAN
Yeah. When's the "cold" part start?

MURPHY
I'm going for the E-PIRB and some
water. Can you get to the generator?

PERRY
Probably. Damn it.

MURPHY
Gotta kill the plant, Chief. That's
the whole game now.
INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
Phillips leads Musi and Bilal into a 65-foot-long passageway.
When the door shuts, we're in semi-DARKNESS. Every fourth
light lit. And we're adrift. It's spooky, even for pirates.
Phillips starts talking. Too loud. With his RADIO KEYED:
PHILLIPS
This is E-Deck. You just tell me
which doors you want opened.

MUSI
All of them.

INT. MAERSK - SUPERSTRUCTURE - PORT STAIRWELL - SAME

Mike Perry moves quickly - but quietly - up stairs. Ahead of
him is a door. He pauses here... then nudges it an inch:

Sunlight spills in...
INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - PASSAGEWAY - RESUMING

Phillips, moving loudly, RADIO KEYED. Comes to a door.
56.

PHILLIPS
These are the Chief's Quarters.
(opens it)
Listen, don't think too badly of my
crew. They're good guys. I think
they're just scared.

Musi barks at Bilal to inspect the CHIEF'S QUARTERS.

MUSI
Somali Marines, you tell them to do
something, they do it. Nobody scared.
(eyeing another door)
They real sailors.

PHILLIPS
That's just a safety locker. Nobody
in there.

MUSI
Open it.

Phillips opens the door. It is, indeed, a SAFETY LOCKER.
PHILLIPS
I'm not here to trick you. I wanna
find 'em as much as you do.
EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - SAME
Murphy emerges from a STARBOARD STAIRWELL on to the Deck.

Light sears his eyes. He squints, doesn't see any pirates out
here. Just an EXTERIOR STAIRWELL. He makes a dash for it.

INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - PASSAGEWAY - RESUMING
Phillips, Musi, Bilal - searching this passageway:

PHILLIPS
And these are my quarters.

MUSI
What's that door?

PHILLIPS
That's a telephone booth.

MUSI
Show me.

EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - SAME

Perry emerges from the PORT STAIRWELL. His eyes adjust.
57.

From here, he can see across the deck. 50 feet away is his
target: the ship's EMERGENCY GENERATOR. Five feet tall, five
feet long, ten feet wide. Green. But:

Straight above it, seven stories off the deck, is a grated
metal WALKWAY jutting off the Bridge.

Elmi_ is currently standing guard on it, meaning he can see
from here straight through to the Generator below.

 

Damn it. Perry exhales, calculating the odds...

PERRY (INTO RADIO)
I've got the generator in sight.

INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING
Musi enters Phillips' QUARTERS. He can't help but react.

The place feels palatial to him. A large room, sunlit by big
windows. With an OFFICE and a SATELLITE OFFICE jutting off
it. He begins to drift through, taking it all in.

PHILLIPS
Standard Captain's Quarters. Then we
can drop down to D-Deck.

Musi pauses. Before him is a MIRROR. Might be the biggest one
Musi's ever seen. He eyes his own reflection as if he'd never
seen his whole face before. An odd, private moment.

Then he notices PICTURES - of Andrea, and Dan, and Phillips'
daughter MARIAH. Musi reacts; Phillips catches it.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
You have a family?

Musi half-nods, looks at the picture of Dan...

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
When he was a boy and I had to go to
sea, he'd stand in front of the door
to keep me from leaving. He still
kids me about it: "My father never
loved me. He'd rather be on a ship
somewhere." I think I'm gonna tell
him not to joke like that anymore.

MUSI
My son says it too.

That hovers. They eye one another.
58.

PHILLIPS
What's his name?

MUSI
Ghedi.

PHILLIPS

He gonna be a pirate too?

MUSI
If he live long enough.

Then Musi heads out.
PHILLIPS

There's a stairwell right at the end

of the passageway here...
EXT. MAERSK - B-DECK - STERN - SAME
Murphy reaches the BULKHEAD beside that ORANGE LIFEBOAT.
Affixed to the bulkhead by a bracket is an E-PIRB (Emergency
Position-Indicating Radio Beacon) a 406 MHz DISTRESS SIGNAL,

red, looks like a walkie-talkie, with an antenna.

He yanks it from its housing, activates it. It starts to
BLINK and BEEP. Sending out a signal... as:

INT. NOAA OFFICE - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Night shift.

A pup named FLOURNOY rises from his monitor, heads for a desk
where DIETZ, his boss, is reading a newspaper.

FLOURNOY
Boss, a call just came in from the
Sarsat desk in Riyadh. They got a
ping from an E-Pirb off the coast of
Somalia.

DIETZ
What kind of vessel?

FLOURNOY
American. The Maersk Alabama.

Not a small piece of news. Dietz grabs a phone...

That's a closet.

Phillips opens the door. Just a closet. Musi eyes him...

PHILLIPS
Where'd you learn your English?

MUSI
Open that one.

Phillips nods, opens another door - revealing:
INT. MAERSK - D-DECK - MATE'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING

ATM Raiza's room. There's a PRAYER RUG on the floor. And an
ARROW on a desk, pointing to "Mecca." Musi stops. Bilal too.

BILAL
Muslim?

Musi throws a searing look at Bilal: "Quiet!" Bilal shrinks.
PHILLIPS
I guess.
(off Musi's look:)

What, you thought we were all Irish?
EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - RESUMING
Perry closes his eyes, grabs the CRUCIFIX around his neck in
heartfelt prayer, then starts across the deck - racing for
that EMERGENCY GENERATOR, directly below Elmi.
INT. MAERSK - C-DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Another corridor. Phillips, Musi, Bilal.

PHILLIPS
C-Deck. More crew quarters.

MUSI
He the only Muslim in the crew?

PHILLIPS

PHILLIPS
Does it matter?

Opening doors throughout, letting Bilal and Musi inspect...
MUSI
I was Christian 'til I was ten. Yeah,
you tell me what you are.
PHILLIPS
If you really need to know, I'm sort
of a half-assed Catholic.

MUSI
Your children?

PHILLIPS
My daughter's kind of on the fence
about church. If it started later in
the morning and served more wine,
she'd probably go.

(nods to a door)

That's another closet.

Again, Musi wants it opened. Again Phillips complies. And
again, it's just a closet...

INTERCUT WITH/EXT. MAERSK - DECK - RESUMING
Perry, running for that Emergency Generator...
INTERCUT WITH/INT. MAERSK - MESS-DECK - MESS - SAME

Murphy enters, sets the blinking E-PIRB on a table, heads
into the KITCHEN...

INT. MAERSK - C-DECK - BOSUN'S ROOM - DAY

Musi searches another small room, then stops: there's a pair
of NEW SANDALS lying here. He eyes them. Hmmmm.

His sandals are old, ratty. But Bilal has no sandals at all.

Musi takes the new sandals for himself and shuts the door
without Bilal knowing what he's missed. But Phillips saw...

EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - SAME

Perry - unseen by Elmi, seven stories above - gets to the
EMERGENCY GENERATOR. It has a lid, like a dumpster.
61.
Perry opens it. Yanks a FUEL VALVE loose. Then throws TWO
SWITCHES... and:
INT. MAERSK - MESS-DECK - CORRIDOR - SAME
Sudden BLACKNESS. The Emergency Power just shut off.

..-and we're in a windowless corridor. Musi grabs the
flashlight from Bilal, too quickly. It falls to the ground.

MUSI
What happened? What happened?

PHILLIPS
Emergency generator must've failed.

Musi gets to the flashlight. The beam hits Phillips' face.
The rest of the world is PITCH-BLACK. Drifting, creaking...

MUSI
How come nothing work on this boat,
Irish?!

PHILLIPS

Bad luck, I guess.
To their right is a door. We DRIFT THROUGH IT, to:
INT. MAERSK - MESS-DECK - MESS - RESUMING

Murphy is on the other side of that door, carrying the E-
PIRB, jugs of WATER, bags of food. Now he freezes - as:

 

PHILLIPS (0.S.)
Crew's Mess. This is where we eat.

MUSI (0.S.)
Show me.

Oh shit. Murphy moves away as fast as he can.

 

.»».as Phillips "fumbles" his keys, stalling... then he opens
the Mess-Door and pauses in the doorway. Here's why:

The flashlight just hit something that shouldn't be here:

A lump on the mess-table, a BLANKET clumsily covering the
water jugs, food-bags... and the E-PIRB, which is blinking.

Moving fast, Phillips takes the flashlight - as if to lead
the way - starts walking toward the KITCHEN.
62.

PHILLIPS

You guys hungry? Got some melon in

the fridge. You should take it, bring

it back to your men. It's just gonna

spoil anyway.
Musi and Bilal follow, leaving the blanket behind. But:
INT. MAERSK - MESS DECK - KITCHEN - CONTINUING
Murphy himself is hiding in this Kitchen... huddled under a
desk. Phillips spots the edge of Murphy's shoe, sticking
out... but he keeps his poker face. In fact:

He shines the flashlight on Bilal's bare feet - just inches
away from the hiding Murphy, who notes them, as intended.

Phillips opens the fridge. Of course, no light pops on. He
pulls out four big CANTALOUPES, and some JUICE-BOXES. Hands
them to Bilal, who has the AK in his hands.
PHILLIPS
(re: AK)
Want me to hold that for you?
Bilal laughs. Then gets another sharp look from Musi.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
I'll find a bag.

He grabs a bag, puts the melons in it. Time to go.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
This leads to the Hospital.

He starts walking, in the darkness. Musi follows. Bilal too.
Murphy, under that desk, finally breathes...
INT. MAERSK - MESS DECK - HOSPITAL BAY - CONTINUING

Phillips leads them into the Hospital Bay. The flashlight
beam reveals nothing.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Okay. Where to next?

MUSI
Engine Room.

Musi grabs the flashlight back from Phillips.

.»+-as Murphy, under that desk, tightens. Oh, no...
63.

INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - DAY
110 and pitch black. 65 year-old Del is barely breathing.

The guys hear a tapped out KNOCK on the door. Durell opens
it. Here's Perry. He hurries back in, winded.

PERRY
Everybody okay?

DURELL
Del's in trouble, Chief. We gotta get
him some air and water.

PERRY
Soon. Soon. Just gotta hang in there.

Perry flips his RADIO ON - just as:
MURPHY (THRU RADIO)
Chief, it's Shane. They're leaving
the Hospital Bay and coming your way.
Break some glass outside the Engine
Room door. One of 'em's barefoot.

PERRY (INTO RADIO)
Copy that. Thanks, Shane.

Perry eyes the men in here. They're fading fast...
INT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - CORRIDOR - LATER DAY

Phillips leads Musi and Bilal toward the Engine Room, well
aware that his crew is in there somewhere.

PHILLIPS
Hang on, lemme just find the Engine
Room key. It's hot down here...

MUSI
All your men babies like you?

PHILLIPS
My men are merchant mariners.

That had an edge on it. They step toward the door... when:

.»..-we hear a CRUNCHING SOUND, and a groan from Bilal; he just
stepped _on what we now see is BROKEN GLASS, by the door.

The kid winces in silence. Musi eyes him, then looks to
Phillips, "Open the door." Phillips obliges. They enter:
64.

INT. MAERSK —- ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING

A deep space. Phillips pauses in the doorway. Musi waves the
flashlight. Bilal is on one foot now, in searing pain...

.--as we drift just on the other side of a door, to:
INTERCUT WITH/INT. AFTER-STEERING ROOM - CONTINUING
12 men, hiding. Durell attending to Del. They hear:

MUSI (0.S.)
Where all your engineers?

PHILLIPS (0.S.)
I dunno. They could be anywhere.

Durell looks to Perry, who quietly grabs a JACK-KNIFE...

.+.as we RETURN TO Phillips and Musi - walking ahead of
Bilal, who is too hobbled to keep up.

MUSI
Why they don't come when you call,
Irish? They don't like you?

Phillips hadn't expected that. He pauses.
..-while his men, on the other side of the door, listen in.

PHILLIPS
Not much, no. I think they think I'm
a prick.

That landed - on the faces of Phillips' men...

MUSI
What that word mean? Prick.

PHILLIPS
A guy who keeps telling you what a
horse's ass you are ‘cause he thinks
it'll make you work harder.

MUSI
Then I'm a prick. Good!
(Phillips almost laughs)
You treat sailors too nice, you get
soft sailors. Lazy, lazy. Captain has

to be a prick.

PHILLIPS
No. He doesn't. It's just a habit.
65.

MUSI
If you keep 'em scared of you, maybe
they sail better - then you don't
have pirates taking your ship away.

PHILLIPS
That wasn't them. That was me.
(a beat)

I always thought when the time came
I'd be able to outrun you. My
mistake.
The men heard that too. But Musi wasn't listening.

MUSI
What's that door?

Musi's pointing at the very door separating him from all
these men, the AFTER-STEERING ROOM DOOR. Uh-oh...

PHILLIPS
That's a Haz-Mat closet.

Musi weighs that. Bilal wincing. The moment just hanging...

Then Musi moves on, choosing not to open the After-Steering

 

door. He just heads out. Bilal follows, limping.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
We should get back to the bridge.

INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - RESUMING

Massive relief on the faces in here. Some gratitude too.
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - DAY

ATM, Wright, and Marv on the floor. Najee and Elmi on guard.
The door opens. Phillips, Musi and Bilal return - Bilal
hobbling, bleeding badly. Najee and Elmi are silent, only
because voicing disappointment would be insubordinate.

But Musi can feel their anxiousness. It infuriates him. So:

MUSI
We go search again.

PHILLIPS
That's a waste of time.

MUSI
My ship now! Understand?

+ eH

+H HK
66.

He grabs that FLARE GUN off a desk, and: *
EXT. MAERSK - PORT BRIDGE-WING - CONTINUING
From here, Musi can see his SKIFF, bobbing gently aport. *

It's a tiny target, one that Phillips missed several times.
But Musi takes aim with that flare. A single shot...

BULLSEYE. The flare hits. The skiff catches fire.
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

Musi returns. From here, all the men can see the SMOKE rising
from the burning skiff. It's unsettling, for the pirates too.

MUSI
I decide! We look again!

PHILLIPS
You wanna find my crew? Then take
these guys.

He gestures to ATM, Wright, and Marv. Musi's thrown.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
The crew's not gonna respond to me.
I'm the guy they're mutinying
against. Take them.

Musi pauses, wary. Eyes the three crew members... then:
MUSI
(xe: ATM)
I take the Muslim.
Phillips sags; he'd wanted all his men off this bridge... *
Musi grabs an AK, yanks ATM up off the floor - but: *
AT™ *
They aren't gonna come out if you're *
armed. *
(Musi pauses) *
It's a respect thing. They're *
sailors. *
Musi considers that, studies ATM - a long beat - then crosses *
*

to Najee, handing off the AK and mumbling instructions.

*

.--which gives Phillips a chance to mumble to ATM, out of
Musi's earshot - while KEYING his radio: *
67.

PHILLIPS
Take him to the guys. They'll know
what to do.

ATM nods. Musi returns, studies ATM.

MUSI

You really a Muslim?
AT™

Yeah.
MUSI

Then why you sail with these guys?

AT™
Why you sail with pirates?

MUSI
‘Cuz pirates own the water, Brother.

He grabs a LONG-KNIFE, and pushes ATM out the door. Phillips
watches, concerned but hopeful. We CUT TO:

INT. PHILLIPS' HOME - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
2 a.m. Andrea sleeps. Outside, a cold WIND blows. Hard.

She's sleeping through it... until the wind jogs that old
SHIP'S BELL on the patio. It rings. And her eyes open.

Fear, that fast. She knows something's wrong... We CUT TO:
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - LATER DAY

TWO HOURS have passed, in silence and heat. Tension hanging.
Phillips is removing the glass from Bilal's feet. It feels
like kindness, but Bilal can't quite trust it.

NAJEE
Where are they? Where they go?

PHILLIPS
I don't know. I'm here with you.
(Najee grunts, irritated)
Colin. Marv. Go look for them.

Wait. What? The pirates eye Phillips. So do Wright and Marv.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)

My men know the ship. They'll find
‘em. And that way you guys can stay
up here on the bridge.
68.

A pretty bold play - and Wright's fairly sure it isn't going
to fly. But Najee decides quickly... turns to Wright:

NAJEE
(re: Phillips)
You no come back, he die.

Wright nods, rises. Marv too. The pirates feign disinterest.
.»-which gives Phillips a chance to say to Wright, quietly:

PHILLIPS
I don't expect to see you two back up
here. Is that understood?
Wright nods. Marv half-nods. They head for the door...
INT. MAERSK - ENGINE DECK - PASSAGEWAY - SAME
125 degrees now. Sweltering. ATM leads Musi.
AT™
This leads to the Engine Room and the
After-Steering.
MUSI

I know the boat. Why you guys all
talk so much?

 

ATM's about to reply... when they both stop. Shocked.

Musi's flashlight just landed on a FACE - Perry - 20 feet
away. Perry ducks behind a corner. Musi starts after him. ATM
has to do something about it. He grabs Musi, but:

Musi strikes him with the flashlight across the jaw and
charges down the corridor. We FOLLOW...

...through this dark, tight space - just a flashlight beam
and Musi's heavy breaths. Around that corner, when:

A JOLT OUT OF THE DARKNESS - Perry, lunging at Musi with the
JACK-KNIFE, slicing into Musi's hand. Musi howls, drops his
long-knife and the flashlight.

ATM jumps in now, grabbing the injured pirate, backing him up
against a bulkhead. Perry puts the knife to Musi's throat.

There's a RADIO on Perry's hip. He grabs it, flips it on:

PERRY (INTO RADIO)
Hey, Pirates. Come in, Pirates.
69.

INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - SAME

The Pirates turn, deeply thrown. That voice, crackling
through the RADIO overhead. Who is that?

PERRY (THRU RADIO, CONT'D)
This is the crew of the Maersk
Alabama. We have your Captain.

Phillips grins. But the pirates are irate.
PERRY (THRU RADIO, CONT'D)
Do you read, Pirates? We have your
captain. Will trade him for our
men... and for you guys getting the
hell off this ship.

The Pirates confer intensely in Somali... until it's decided
that Najee will reply. He grabs the radio.

NAJEE (INTO RADIO)
You have our guy?

PERRY (THRU RADIO)
Yeah. Bleeding, but we got him.

NAJEE (INTO RADIO)
We don't have a boat.

PHILLIPS
Take our lifeboat. On the stern.

Najee lowers the radio, looks to Phillips:

NAJEE
We need money.

PHILLIPS
It's in my room.

NAJEE
Show me.

INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - EVENING
Phillips opens his safe, extracts $30,000.

PHILLIPS
Thirty thousand dollars.

NAJEE
And how much you worth, Irish? How
much a couple of your guys worth?
70.

That had some edge. Phillips hands over the cash.
EXT. MAERSK - B-DECK - STARBOARD STERN - EVENING

The lifeboat sits on those skids, above B-Deck. Anyone inside
it will drop from here, 45 feet straight into the sea.

Elmi, Najee, and Bilal eye it, trying to look undaunted.

NAJEE
Need more fuel.

PHILLIPS
We can arrange that.

NAJEE
And food. Water.

Phillips calls out... one deck up... to:
EXT. MAERSK - C-DECK - CONTINUING
Murphy and Durell are one deck above the lifeboat, watching:

PHILLIPS
They want some food.

Murphy looks to Durell, who nods, under his breath:

DURELL
I'll go find something spoiled.

MURPHY
Pork. Make sure it's pork.

Durell smiles, goes. Murphy leans over and half-waves to the
three Pirates, as if he were their best pal:

 

MURPHY
Food's on the way!

NAJEE
You show us our captain!

MURPHY
Soon as you're in the water.

Najee doesn't like it. Murphy doesn't care.

PHILLIPS
Let's go get your fuel.
71.

INT. MAERSK - EMERGENCY GENERATOR ROOM - EVENING
Phillips siphons fuel from a DIESEL GENERATOR into buckets.

Najee stands guard. Elmi is a few feet away, flipping the
same GENERATOR switches that Perry used to kill the power.

PHILLIPS
Will you please leave those alone?
ELMI
You trouble, Irish. You pain in the
ass.
PHILLIPS
Let's go.
NAJEE

No. More fuel.

PHILLIPS
Where ya headed? Disneyworld?

NAJEE
More.

INT. LIFEBOAT - SUSPENDED - EVENING

Najee, Elmi, and Bilal get their first look inside the
lifeboat: hatches, seats, the elevated bridge... (They don't
know it yet, but this will be "home" for the next few days.)

PHILLIPS
Once you're in and secured, you're
gonna hit this valve. Might take a
few pumps. The cog releases, and you
go down the skids and into the water.

Najee should be nodding. He isn't. Something odd about that.
But before Phillips can react... he sees the caricature of
himself, drawn by Dave. And the words "Philips is a shit."
Phillips eyes it, breathes out an ironic smile.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
At least spell my name right...

The pirates don't comment. He moves on:

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Your food's here.

Najee nods. Phillips steps through the AFT HATCH, to:
72.

EXT. MAERSK - B-DECK — CONTINUING

Bilal and Elmi watch as Durell steps forward with a box of
FOOD, covered with tinfoil. Phillips gets a whiff, smiles.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Specialty of the house, huh?

DURELL
Steward called it “horse-cock."

Phillips grins. Murphy is ten feet away, glaring at the
pirates. They're keeping a watchful eye on him.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Crew holding up okay?

DURELL
Couple heat-strokes, but they're
fine.

PHILLIPS

See that they get treated, huh?

DURELL
Why, Cap? You goin' somewhere?

PHILLIPS
Ya never know.

That hangs there. He turns to the pirates:

PHILLIPS
Okay. Get yourselves harnessed in.
We'll send your captain down to you
once you're in the water.

NAJEE
No.

That halted things. Murphy waits. Phillips not reacting, as:

NAJEE (CONT'D)

You come in water with us. When we
have captain back, you show him how
boat works, then you go free.

 

MURPHY
That wasn't the deal, Asshole.

Najee points an AK right at Murphy's head, and:

NAJEE
New deal.
73.

That fast, everything ramps up. Elmi points his AK at Durell.
Bilal, on one foot, points his at the guys on C-Deck. And
suddenly everybody's barking - Somali vs. English:

NAJEE (CONT'D)

(re: crew-members )
Who you like least, Captain? Who you
don't mind if they dead?

More barking. More AK-pointing, testosterone rising - until:

PHILLIPS
Belay that! All of you!

The barking stops. We PUSH IN on Phillips...
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)

(at Najee)
Stop threatening my crew.

NAJEE
You get in the boat, nobody shout at
nobody.

PHILLIPS

Then let's go.

The pirates lower their weapons, heading for the lifeboat.
Phillips too. No one on the crew can believe it.

MURPHY
Wait a minute. You're goin' in the
water with these guys?

PHILLIPS
Send him down once we're underway. On
the ladder amidship.

Murphy's at a loss. The whole crew is.

MURPHY
How 'bout I go instead? And you stay
on deck. I can show 'em how it works
as good as you.

PHILLIPS
You buckin' for overtime pay now?

MURPHY
Cap, you get in there with them, you
ain't comin' out.

PHILLIPS
We want ‘em off the boat, right?
74.

MURPHY
Yeah. But not like this.

Phillips climbs in the lifeboat.

MURPHY (CONT'D)
Cap...

PHILLIPS
Crew's yours, Shane. You got it?

A last look between them. Feels like a goodbye. Murphy nods.
Then Phillips "dogs" (closes) the aft hatch.

INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUING
Phillips, sealed in with them now, moves to the bridge.

PHILLIPS
Get your yourselves secured. This
thing drops like a stone.

The seats in here have harnesses like those on a carnival
ride. Bilal, Elmi, and Najee strap themselves in, facing aft.

BILAL
Hey, Irish. How come you do that?
Your guy wanna take your place in
here with the dangerous pirates. How
come you say no?

PHILLIPS
I'm Captain. He's crew. Are you
harnessed in?
Bilal nods without understanding. Phillips grabs a radio:
PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
They can still strafe the ship, so
keep the guys out of harm's way.

PERRY (THRU RADIO)
Roger that.

PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
How's his hand?

INTERCUT WITH/EXT. MAERSK - C-DECK - SAME (EVENING)

Musi, bound and gagged, his hand bleeding profusely, has been
brought up to C-Deck under guard. Perry eyes him.

PERRY (INTO RADIO)
He'll live.
75.
PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Okay. Releasing lifeboat now.

Phillips puts the radio down, harnesses himself in, grabs a
RELEASE VALVE, (a hydraulic pump.) Starts PUMPING it, as:

INTERCUT WITH/EXT. MAERSK - B-DECK - RESUMING
A COG holds the lifeboat on these skids.
Now it's receding, hydraulically...
.+.-as Phillips keeps pumping the valve, eyeing the pirates.
PHILLIPS
(quietly, eyes heavenward)

God, if you have to kill someone on

this drop, I'd appreciate it not

being me...
A few more pumps on that release valve, then:

.+.the COG on the skids falls away.

..-and the lifeboat, unmoored, rockets down the skids. 12
feet, like a sled, nose down, then off the edge of the ship:

EXT. MAERSK - STERN - CONTINUING
A 45-FOOT DEAD DROP, hurtling toward the water.
INT. LIFEBOAT - FALLING - CONTINUING

The pirates are stunned by their own velocity. Phillips
braces himself. The surface rushing up to meet him, then:

A THUNDEROUS PLUNGE as the lifeboat smashes into the sea,
sending up a huge plume, vanishing under water.

It's like a car wreck in here, bodies hurtling, banging,
restrained by those harnesses. Water ABOVE us... until:

INTERCUT WITH/EXT. WATER-LINE - CONTINUING

The nose of the lifeboat breaches the surface, its bridge ten
feet above the waterline, visible through those WINDOWS.

 

Phillips gathers his wits, looks to his passengers.

PERRY (THRU RADIO)
Cap, you okay?

PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
We're okay. Bring him amidship.
76.

EXT. MAERSK - DECK - STARBOARD - EVENING
Murphy on deck. Musi, hand badly BLEEDING, is beside him.

The lifeboat - powered by a 4 cylinder diesel engine - pulls
up alongside the Maersk 20 feet below, idling amidship.

MURPHY
You go in, he comes out. Right?

Musi smiles. The whole crew is watching from various decks -
as he begins to climb down his own ladder, slowly.

 

INTERCUT WITH/EXT. LIFEBOAT - WATER-LINE - CONTINUING

Elmi opens the aft hatch, points his AK at the Maersk crew
again. Nobody flinches. Musi keeps descending.

INTERCUT WITH/INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUING

Through the cockpit window, Phillips can see Murphy on the
Maersk deck - but there's an ocean between them now.

Phillips clutches the radio... then:

PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Listen, Shane. This ship is due in
Mombasa two days from now.

MURPHY (INTO RADIO)
That's what the schedule says.

PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
I expect you to get it there.

That lands. And Murphy doesn't like it. He watches Musi,
descending, then looks to the open hatch, doing the math.

MURPHY (INTO RADIO)
I got a better idea. How ‘bout you
jump outta that lifeboat, right now.

PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Can't do that, Shane. You know that.

MURPHY (INTO RADIO)
Cap, enough of this already. Get the
hell outta there. We can take these
assholes.

PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Crew did a helluva job today; you did
too. Tell ‘em that, okay?
77.

Murphy's about to respond when...

Musi
INT.

Musi
look

reaches the hatch, and climbs in - leaving it open.
LIFEBOAT - CONTINUING

eyes Phillips, and Bilal's now-bandaged foot, (with a
of mild scorn.) Najee quickly hands over the $30,000.

PHILLIPS
Not much to operating this thing;
I'll take you through it. If you want
me to fix up your hand there's a med-
kit behind you.

MUSI
Did you say goodbye to your men?

So much for pretense. Phillips expected that.

PHILLIPS
I did.

MUSI
Good.

..-which is when - no surprise - Musi grabs Phillips and
shoves him to the floor, then throws the hatch shut, and

guns

the throttle, the lifeboat speeding away.

The crew on the Maersk holler, but they're helpless.

Phillips is shoved into a seat at gunpoint. No expression.

EXT.

MAERSK —- DECK — RESUMING

The lifeboat speeds away from us. The men watch it go, livid.

MURPHY
You dumb son of a bitch.
(sighs, then...)
Okay, let's power up and run ‘em
down. Full ahead, and hard left.

The crew goes into action... We CUT TO:

MUSI
Protect us from other pirates.
(Phillips is silent)
Some other tribe come, try to take
you away. We make big speed, then...

He makes an EXPLOSION sound, laughs. Phillips eyes him.

Musi opens the FOOD-PACKAGE from the Maersk. He smells it,
grimaces. Motions to Bilal, "Take the wheel." Then Musi opens
the tiny aft hatch - again, Phillips watching.

EXT. LIFEBOAT - AFT DECK - SAME

Musi tosses the styrofoam box into the water, then spots
something... He stares - angered but not surprised:

It's the MAERSK, fully powered now, on his tail. Musi ducks
back down, shuts the hatch.

INT. LIFEBOAT - MOVING - RESUMING
Musi eyes Phillips.

MUSI
Thought you said ship was broken.

PHILLIPS
I guess they fixed it.

MUSI
Uh-huh.
(at his crew, in Somali)
Come get your shares!

The men approach him on the Bridge. He hands each their
"share" of the $30,000. It's bloody money, though. From the
GASH on his hand.

You've got your exams this week.

DAN (THRU CELL)
Mom...

ANDREA (INTO CELL)
It's a zoo here, Honey. Reporters all
over. I want you away from it.

Whaddaya think Dad would say?

DAN (THRU CELL)
He'd probably say, "Do you know how
much I'm spending on that school?
Stay put and do your job."

ANDREA (INTO CELL)
Probably.

Amber approaches Andrea, holding a LAND LINE.

AMBER
(re: phone)
Andrea, it's John Reinhart. Chairman
of the Maersk Line.

Andrea pales. Maybe he's calling with bad news...

ANDREA (INTO CELL)
Sweetheart, I have to take this; it's
the guy from Maersk. I'll call you as
soon as I know anything. It's all
gonna be okay. I love you...

DAN (THRU CELL)
I'm getting in the car. I'll be home
tonight.

CLICK. Andrea sighs, hangs up the cell, grabs the phone...

ANDREA (INTO PHONE)
Hello?

REINHART (THRU PHONE)
Hi, Andrea. This is John Reinhart.
How ya holding up?

ANDREA (INTO PHONE)
Just your typical April morning...

REINHART (THRU PHONE)
I understand. Listen, there's been a
development - and I wanted you to
hear it from me. We've gotten the
ship back. The crew's fine. The
pirates have escaped on a lifeboat.

(dreading this...)

But they have your husband with them.

Andrea pales. Can barely speak. The room waits...

ANDREA (INTO PHONE)
On the lifeboat.

REINHART (THRU PHONE)
Yes. It's a hostage situation. But
you have my assurance, we're going to
do everything we can to get him back
to you safely.

ANDREA (INTO PHONE)
I see.

+ eH
82.

REINHART (THRU PHONE)
I'm sending two of my best people to
your home - to help you deal with the
media, incoming calls, anything you
might need. Would that be okay?

Andrea can't reply. She can barely breathe.

REINHART (THRU PHONE)
Andrea?... Andrea?

INT. LIFEBOAT —- MOVING - DAY

9 a.m. 105 degrees in here. Phillips sits, sweating. Baking.
Musi sitting opposite us, flexes his injured hand, pained.

PHILLIPS
That infected yet?

MUSI
How would I know?

PHILLIPS
Fever, shaking, vomiting,
incontinence. Then it gets bad.

Musi pauses, conscious that his men are watching.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
They're not gonna think you're a
baby. They're gonna think you're
staying fit enough to maintain
command.

Musi rises, gets the First Aid kit, hands it over. Phillips
pulls out eyewash, saline, bandages, a long roll of tape.

Phillips casually cuts the tape with the JACK-KNIFE that's
been in his pocket for two days now. The pirates eye him.

Without comment he surrenders the knife... and unwraps the
bloody shirt off Musi's hand, revealing a nasty-looking gash.
He pours eyewash and saline on it, gestures toward Bilal:

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Need to re-dress his foot too.

MUSI
Why you so worried about him?

PHILLIPS
He's a sailor and he's injured.

MUSI
Remember what I tell you about
treating a sailor too nice?

PHILLIPS

How're the sandals? They fit okay?
MUSI

You trouble, Irish. Yeah, you a

problem.
They eye Bilal, nervously knotting that three-colored rope.

MUSI (CONT'D)
Nothing wrong with him - he just
afraid.

PHILLIPS
You're not?

MUSI
Yes. Of seeing my children starve.
(no reply)
We get back to Somalia, everything
working. Tell insurance guys what we
want for you, and everybody get rich.

PHILLIPS
Sorry. But I doubt it.
(Musi waits)
Why would the line pay you? They got
their ship back, their crew, all of
their cargo. And Captains are
replaceable; don't you know that?

MUSI
Only some.

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - DAY

Dan is home now. He sits beside Andrea... and Amber, Nancy,
DAWN, JANET, PATTY (more sisters in law); LEA (Andrea's
sister); Mike Willard; TEN OTHER NEIGHBORS.

All of them looking at Allison - the Maersk rep - who stands
in front of two ERASURE BOARDS. She shuts the tv off, and:

ALLISON
Okay. Rule Number One. No more tv.
There are too many rumors bouncing
around, and way too many opinions.
From now on, we get our information
only from the State Department,
Defense Department, or from Maersk.

ALLISON (cont'd)
Everything that's confirmed goes on
these erasure boards. Starting with
this: the USS Bainbridge is on site
and in contact with the pirates.
There hasn't been an official ransom
demand made yet. The Commander of the
Bainbridge is taking his orders from
a Task Force Commander, who answers
to the Flag Officer of the Task
Force, an Admiral named Michelle
Howard. We are in touch with her on a
regular basis.

AMBER
Go Michelle.

ALLISON
She answers to the Fifth Fleet
Commander in Bahrain. He answers to
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, who answers to the Secretary
of Defense, and ultimately President
Obama. All of whom are monitoring
this situation closely. The President
is receiving regular updates on the
situation. If he feels a military
response is required, he will give
the go-ahead for a rescue. It's his
call. Flattering, right?

It is. So why'd Andrea just go pale?

ANDREA
Oh shit.
(they wait...)
Richard voted for McCain.

INT. LIFEBOAT - MOVING - DAY
Phillips, in his usual seat. Then:
THUMP THUMP THUMP. The sound turns our heads. It's Najee,
trying to break a WINDOW ON THE BRIDGE with the butt of his
AK-47. Repeatedly. An attempt to get some air in here.
PHILLIPS
Ya might ask him to stop that, before
he takes your head off.

MUSI
He wants air.

PHILLIPS
But he's still got the clip in.

Musi nods, then barks at Najee in Somali. Najee removes the
clip from the AK, starts banging again...
Finally, he breaks _a_ pane. A small trickle of air blows in.

PHILLIPS
I have to urinate.

Musi calls to Bilal, who puts down the rope, grabs his AK,
and - hobbling - leads Phillips back to the aft-hatch. Bilal
un-dogs it, and they emerge:

EXT. LIFEBOAT - AFT HATCH - MOVING - CONTINUING

Phillips steps outside... and his jaw drops - just saw *
something huge, off our stern:

The USS BAINBRIDGE, Guided Missile Detroyer, 300 yards away. *
Bilal smiles, thrilled. Huh? He pushes Phillips inside... *
INT. LIFEBOAT - MOVING - RESUMING

Bilal dogs the hatch closed. Looks to Musi.

BILAL (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

Navy here, Boss! U.S. Navy! *
MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Yeah?
Musi turns to port... and there it is, visible through the

tiny cockpit windows. The Bainbridge.

Instant reaction: Musi WHOOPS with excitement. Couldn't be
happier. The others join in. Phillips is at a loss.

As they yell and shout, Musi grabs the lifeboat radio:

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Navy Navy? You got the pirates here!
No military action! No military
action! We not Al Qaeda!

The voice of CAPTAIN FRANK CASTELLANO comes through:

CASTELLANO (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
This is the USS Bainbridge.

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Good to see you! We not Al Qaeda!
Need food, water, batteries, and more *
bullets! Lifeboat out!
86.

End of transmission. Musi laughs. His men do too. Huh...?

PHILLIPS
I don't get it. Why're you so happy
to see a navy ship?

MUSI

We got an escort now - get us back to
Somali waters, safe from other
pirates! Everybody knows to stay away
from the gray!

(means it)
You beautiful, Irish! You better than
twenty hostages!

EXT. NAVY ZODIAC/EXT. LIFEBOAT - DAY
A NAVY ZODIAC (inflated motorboat) skims water. Aboard it are
FOUR SAILORS, commanded by LT. KINIMURA, bearing a BOX of
PROVISIONS. The Zodiac reaches the lifeboat, both idling.
Musi opens the aft hatch, armed. Eyeing Kinimura.
KINIMURA
We want to see the Captain first,
make sure he's still okay.

Musi barks at Elmi below deck, who shouts at Phillips:

ELMI (0.S.)
Come. Wave.

Phillips appears in the hatch, waves at the sailors... then
Elmi pulls him back down below. A beat...

Kinimura's men hand over the provisions: a RADIO, batteries,
water, chocolate POP-TARTS. And, strangely, A-1 Steak Sauce.

Kinimura pulls the radio out, hands it to Musi:
KINIMURA
Dedicated channel. My C.O. wants to
talk to you again.

MUSI
I'll talk to him later.

Kinimura reacts, thrown. Musi smiles.
MUSI (CONT'D)
Old Somali saying: "You have all the
watches. But we have all the time."

He laughs. Kinimura doesn't. We CUT TO:

EXT. UNDERHILL, VT. - ST. THOMAS PARKING LOT - MORNING

The ARMY OF REPORTERS is now confined to a church parking
lot. They watch as a "COME HOME CAPTAIN PHILLIPS" sign is
hung across the street. There are YELLOW RIBBONS everywhere.

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING
TV, phones, 20 people here to help. Andrea drifts through.

FOOD PLATTERS are all over now. Casseroles, lasagnas, cakes,
sent by friends, strangers. Serving trays are everywhere. Lea
approaches Andrea, bearing a particularly grand one.

LEA
This is from the local Somali
community. They want you to know how
sorry and ashamed they are.

ANDREA
We have a local Somali community?

Lea shrugs. Andrea looks around for Dan. There he is, by a
window, looking out at the snow.

ANDREA (CONT'D)
You doin' okay?

He shrugs, but the answer's no.

DAN
I was just thinking how much he loves
the snow. If the temperature hits
eighty, he thinks it's too warm. But
he never complains about snow.

ANDREA
He's gonna be okay, Honey. He's
looking up at the sky, right now,
just like you are - thinking about

you.
DAN
Or maybe telling the pirates how to
sail.
She breathes out a much-needed laugh. Dan too... but there is

pure terror behind it. Andrea can see it; it's heartbreaking.

She knows what to do. A few feet away is FATHER DANIELSON.
He's 50, their local priest - has been here all morning.
Andrea takes his hand:

ANDREA

Can we say one more, Father? Maybe
all of us together?

(Danielson pauses)
Richard's so strong; I know he's
hanging in there. But can we say one
for the men who're trying to help
him?

Danielson nods, of course. Andrea grabs Dan, as we CUT TO:
INT. C-17 - FLYING - NIGHT
A MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE, 5,000 feet over the ocean.

Inside, gear - weapons, comm, nav, scuba - all strapped into
an RHIB (rigid-hull-inflatable-boat). The RHIB is secured to
the floor by cables, with parachutes attached to its stern.

-+-as 16 men stand, game-faces on. This is NAVY SEAL TEAM
SIX. We move down the row of them, starting with their TEAM
LEADER, Lt. Aboitiz. Then face after face, until we land on:

Two Seals - PETTIS (black, future world-leader), and JOON
(Korean-American, quiet.) A light above them goes green.

ABOITIZ
Okay, guys. Time to hop and pop.

The BACK OF THIS PLANE OPENS like a mouth. Wind rushes in. A
GUILLOTINE severs the cables securing that gear-laden RHIB.

...and the RHIB rockets out of here at 120 mph, sucked out
with awesome force, its chute deploying automatically. Now
the SEALS themselves dive out. We FOLLOW PETTIS:

EXT. MID-AIR/EXT. INDIAN OCEAN - CONTINUING - NIGHT

Falling, in darkness. Not a photon of light beneath us, (the
waters of the Indian Ocean don't refract light at night.)
Feels like an endless abyss down there. No form at all.

But there's a lit ALTIMETER on our wrist, counting down...
700 feet, 600... Our CHUTE above us. Then the RHIB hits water
below us. A huge SPLASH. We keep plummeting, down...

Then... a BIGGER SPLASH. That's us, submerging powerfully,
water all around us... then coming up again, to find:

16 men in synchronized action, SEALS leaving their chutes to
sink in the water and boarding the RHIB. The BAINBRIDGE
appears now, coming to get us. The C-17 is long gone.

We've just "splashed in," SEAL-style...

enters, exchanging a salute with Castellano.

GARRIDOS
Those windows aren't much of a

A few sailors react. But Aboitiz is unfazed:

ABOITIZ
A lifeboat riding bow-down on this
ship's rooster-tail has a 17-second
cycle of harmonic motion. At the half-
point of every cycle, or at 8.5
seconds, the lifeboat will, for a
brief instant, be steady on.

As he CONTINUES, we RESUME INTERCUT WITH: *

Five SNIPER-KILLER TEAMS, in pairs: RAMOS-WINSTROM; INGRAM- *
NGUYEN; SHRIDAR-KAY; REESE-HICKS; and Pettis-Joon.

Four of the teams set up shop on LARGE CRATES, (a shooter *
resting his weapon on the crate, spotter behind him.) Pettis
lies belly down on a mat, on the fantail, Joon behind him.

The snipers have SR-25's. The Spotters have OPTICS DEVICES.
Through Joon's we see the lifeboat in the distance. Its
windows look TINY from here. Bobbing up and down...

Every SEAL sound-checks his NECK MIKE, as:
gl.

ABOITIZ (0.S.)

During that lull, the scopes on a
sniper's SR-25 can image their
targets very easily. The first shot,
a wad cutter, takes out the windows,
removing all deflection criteria and
giving four shooters, each on a
single target, a clean line of sight.

INT. LIFEBOAT - MOVING - SAME (NIGHT)

Najee is finishing that multi-colored rope. Elmi is sitting
up front, near the fuel buckets. Musi on the bridge.

That leaves Bilal, guarding Phillips.

PHILLIPS
How's your foot? Any better?

Bilal shrugs, conscious of fraternizing with the hostage.

MUSI (0.S.)
You stop talking to him.

Musi, calling out from the Bridge, angry. Bilal tightens.
MUSI (CONT'D)
He already got one captain. Somali
Marine don't need two.

Phillips shrugs, turns away... looking through that box of *
provisions. Pop-Tarts, etc... until he notices something:

*

The back of that bottle of A-1 steak sauce. Something's been *
written on it. By hand, in English - obviously a message left
for him by the Navy. Phillips reads it: *

"Talk. We can hear you. USN." *

Oh. But Phillips barely has time to integrate it, when:

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
This is the FBI. Come in.

Musi's eyes just went wide. His men react as well. FBI. Three
VERY big letters. He regroups, grabs the radio:

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)

to insurance negotiator.

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
Sorry. F.B.I. My name's Garridos.

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
Okay. What'll you give me?

Phillips watches all this... noting Bilal's reaction.

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
What's your name? I'd like to know
what to call you.

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
You can call me Captain.

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)

out. Tell me about your injury. And
your crew-member.

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
You have a gash on your right hand,
and you've got a crew-member with
glass in his foot. Correct?

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
I want to talk to the insurance guy!

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)

I have trained medical personnel on
this boat, and a first-class hospital
bay. Maybe you two come aboard and
get treated. Then we can talk about
things, face to face.

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
I get it fixed when I get back to
Somalia. We talk then.

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
That's gonna be a problem. We're
willing to work with you - but we
can't let this thing reach land.

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
We Somali Marines! We have right to

Musi hangs up, angry. No one speaks. Then:

Musi grabs the radio again.

Insurance negotiator! Two million

Musi does... and he sees the five sniper-killer teams on the
fantail of the Bainbridge - aiming right at him.
94.

It's just a moment - blink and you'd miss it - but all of his
bravado just vanished; and Phillips saw. Bilal saw too. Musi
regroups quickly... Then, with utter control:

MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
We going home now. Stay away from the
windows.

He leans on the throttle, instant acceleration. His men don't
speak. But they know something's wrong.

Najee and Elmi drift away, quietly. That leaves Phillips and
Bilal, out of everyone's earshot.

Phillips studies the kid. Bilal looks away... Then:
PHILLIPS
Are you a good swimmer?
(Bilal's a blank)
‘Cause you need to jump off this boat
and get away from here, as fast as
you can. Your captain's leading you
to some very bad places.

BILAL
I never been anywhere else.

That landed. Bilal walks away. Phillips sags. On the bridge,
Musi starts singing a SOMALI WAR SONG. Loud. Off-key.
Intentionally unsettling. And he keeps singing, as:

INT. USS BAINBRIDGE - CIC - RESUMING

Garridos, listening in. He takes off his headset.

GARRIDOS

Castellano nods, no problem.

ANDREA (INTO PHONE)
That's good.

MURPHY (PHONE, CONT'D)
Just wanted to tell you - we all did -
we owe your husband our lives, every

you stay strong, okay? He loves you.

96.

The NAVY GUYS are leaving. A NEW CAPTAIN, Phillips'
replacement, comes aboard. Murphy nods politely. The show
goes on - as we CUT TO:

INT. LIFEBOAT - MOVING - NIGHT (2:30 A.M.)

Phillips stands, wet and bleeding. His hands tied to the
horizontal bar overhead, feet tied too.

(We've TIME-JUMPED again: Phillips has already been beaten
for trying to escape. They've just made him piss himself.)

But there's now an AK an INCH FROM HIS FACE - held by Elmi,
who pulls the trigger.

CLICK. He's just dry-firing it, but the flinch from Phillips
made Elmi smile. The tenor in here has gotten meaner. Sicker.

Najee knots that three-colored rope. Musi's on the bridge.
Bilal is silent. The lifeboat muscles along.

..-when, unsolicited, Phillips begins to speak:

PHILLIPS
So it's the beginning of time. Adam's
the first man ever. And all of his
body parts hold a meeting, to see who
should be in charge.

Wait. Is he telling a joke? Now? Elmi can't believe it.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)

Adam's heart says, "I think I should
run things, 'cause if I stop pumping,
he dies." But his eyes say, "Wait a
minute, we think we should run
things. I mean, without us, he
couldn't see anything, or get
around." Then his brain says, "I'm
obviously the most important organ. I
control breathing, thinking,
everything." A real argument.

No doubt about it; he's telling a joke. Musi turns, intrigued
by the balls on this guy. Najee and Bilal too, watching...

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)

Then, from down deep, a quiet voice
pipes in. "Excuse me. But I think I'm
the most important body part." It was
the asshole talking.

The pirates eye one another, mild disbelief and amusement.

*
97.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
The other body parts just laughed at
him - get serious, buddy - and went
back to work, deciding to vote on it
in a couple days.
(a beat)
But the next morning, the asshole
surprised them all. He shut down.
Wouldn't let anything through.
Breakfast, lunch, dinner - nothing.
And pretty soon, the whole body began
to suffer. The brain got foggy, the
heart could barely beat, the eyes
couldn't stay open. After three days
of it they all came to him and said,
"Okay! Okay! You win! You're the most
important! We give!" Argument over.
(eyes on Musi now)
And that's why, ever since, all
through history... it's assholes who
have always been in charge.

There it was, a huge fuck-you, aimed right at Musi. Silence.

...-then Bilal can't help himself. He starts to laugh. Elmi
too. Then Najee. Even Musi finds himself chuckling. Phillips
too. Five strung-out overheated guys, laughing.

-..until this boat is suddenly ROCKED by an unseen force -
pounding it, turning it SIDEWAYS. The pirates are knocked to
their feet - it's that violent. And NOISY, deafening:

 

EXT. LIFEBOAT - AT SEA - CONTINUING

One of those NAVY KNIGHTHAWK HELICOPTERS is hovering right
above us - its rotors' GALE-FORCE WIND literally knocking the
lifeboat sideways. A pretty impressive show of force.

INT. LIFEBOAT - MOVING - RESUMING

Musi struggles with the wheel, but it's useless. The craft
isn't powerful enough to keep its heading.

MUSI
What are they doing, Irish?

Phillips keeps his eyes on those FUEL BUCKETS - sliding
around. The wind keeps pounding us. And that noise...

MUSI (CONT'D)
What are they doing?!

PHILLIPS
I don't know. I'm here with you.
98.

Musi, livid, guns the engine. But it dies on him.

Now the powerless lifeboat is pushed in a CIRCLE by the wind.
Spinning like a top, buffeted by air and noise. Musi's men,
dizzied, await his orders... as:

GARRIDOS (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Garridos for lifeboat. Come in.

Musi doesn't answer - just hits the ignition again. The
engine won't turn over.

GARRIDOS (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Garridos for lifeboat. Come in,
lifeboat.

We're spinning in circles, deafened by the noise - the
Knighthawk literally sitting right on top of us...

MUSI (CONT'D)
What's wrong with your boat, Irish?

PHILLIPS
Now it's my boat again?

MUSI
What's wrong with it?

PHILLIPS
How the hell should I know?

MUSI
You baby, Phillips. Lazy American.

Musi fumes. His men await a plan. Noise pounding. Sniper
teams waiting on the Bainbridge. Everything closing in.

can't tell the Captain what to do.
But I can send over a mechanic to
take a look for you.

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Pull back! No military action!

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
Fine. What will you give me?

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
I give you his ears! I give you his
fingers!
(no reply)
I told you! I talk only to insurance
man! Only to money man!

GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
Sorry. I'm all you got. And we cannot
allow you to return to Somali waters.

We PUSH IN on Musi, all that noise bearing down on him, as:

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
(ice cold)
Fine. We die here then.

He slams the radio down, looks at his men:

MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Finish the ropes.

That sounded permanent, and Phillips looks shaken. We're
still spinning, getting hammered by the rotor wind...

MUSI (CONT'D)
What's wrong, Phillips? You don't
want to die at sea? What kind of
sailor are you?

PHILLIPS
Like to see my wife again. And my
kids.

MUSI

American sailors are all babies.

GARRIDOS (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Captain! Come in.

MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Untie him.

Elmi starts to untie Phillips, as:

GARRIDOS (THRU RADIO)

Why don't you come aboard now? Get

some medical care. We'll figure a way

GARRIDOS (THRU RADIO) (cont'd)
out of this thing. We can set up a
tow-line from our fantail, so you
don't drift into hostile waters. We
know there are rival tribes around
here. Look, a gesture of goodwill:

The noise suddenly STOPS, the chopper pulling up. SILENCE.
Somehow, that infuriates Musi even worse. He decides:

MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
Okay. We gonna kill the hostage now.
Need a bodybag over here. Out.

End of transmission. He marches toward Phillips - at the very
moment Phillips, untied by Elmi, falls into a seat... and our
narrative catches up to itself COMPLETELY, as:

A JOLT: Phillips yanked out of the seat by Musi - suddenly,
urgently. Rage in Musi's eyes, infuriated by all this...

MUSI
I want you to know something. We were
all fishermen once. Other countries
come and overfish our waters, dump
all their trash here - no Somali
government to stop them. So there's
no more fishing.

A few feet away, Najee and Elmi pull an ORANGE SURVIVAL SUIT
from a bin, and begin to spread it on the floor. Odd...

IMAGES, JUMP-CUT: Musi handing the 9mm to Bilal; the pirates
kneeling down to pray for Allah's blessing, and:

PHILLIPS
Andrea...

He shuts his eyes.

EXT. PHILLIPS' HOME - BACK PATIO - DAY

Allison emerges on to the patio - to find Andrea, hiding here
again, alone against the snow, staring sadly at that old

SHIP'S BELL.
ANDREA
(re: bell)
He's so stubborn about things.

ALLISON
I'm counting on it.

Andrea smiles. Allison sits.

101.

ALLISON (CONT'D)
Your family's doing a prayer circle.
You wanna come in?

ANDREA
The Navy's not expecting a good
result. Are they.

Bam. That put Allison on her heels. She regroups, then:

ALLISON
The Navy's doing exactly what it set
out to do - isolate the pirates and
keep them from getting to shore.

ANDREA

But they can't launch a rescue
without getting him killed. And
there's no way the U.S. Government
could allow the pirates to take
ransom and escape prosecution. So...

(Allison's silent)
Has anybody said anything to you
about preparing me for the worst?

No reply. The answer, obviously, is yes.
ALLISON
It's not an indicator of our
confidence in the outcome...

That sounded lame, and she knows it. A beat passes...

ALLISON (CONT'D)
Do you want to come in with us?

Andrea starts to cry again, can't quite hold it in.

ANDREA
I think I'll take a walk instead.

And away she goes, off the patio and out into the SNOWY FIELD
beyond. Allison, helpless, just watches her go.

From here, Andrea grows smaller and smaller. We CUT TO:
INT. LIFEBOAT - NOT MOVING - SAME
The pirates pray to Allah. Phillips watches, powerless...

We CIRCLE AROUND him, his breath shortening, heart rate
climbing - as these men pray for a blessing to kill him.
102.

PHILLIPS
You're not gonna get paradise and
seventy-two virgins for doing this.
You're just gonna get your men
killed.

Musi looks up from his prayer, his eyes lifeless:

MUSI
Keep talking, Irish...

That was chilling. Musi returns to his prayer, then gives an
order in Somali. The pirates get to their feet.

Najee grabs that THREE-COLORED ROPE now, weaving it through
Phillips' hands. Carefully. We hear "Halal. Halal."

We PUSH IN ON PHILLIPS - as he steels himself for one last
stand. Just can't let himself surrender too easily. *

MUSI
Bring him over.

Elmi grabs Phillips, starts to pull him on to the orange
survival suit. But there's a problem, instantly:

Phillips isn't moving.

Huh? Elmi tries again - but Phillips digs in and puts his *
fists under his chin. Not moving.

PHILLIPS *

No. Sorry. *

What? They scream at him, livid.
MUSI
You make hands-up posture now!
Execution posture!

PHILLIPS
I'm not moving.

Musi shouts at Elmi, who shouts at Phillips. Najee and Bilal
jump in too, Bilal pointing that handgun at him - as we:

INTERCUT WITH/EXT. UNDERHILL - WOODS - DAY

Andrea walks, all alone and shaky as hell. Then she STOPS... *
And turns. Some instinct just told her to get back home... *

INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING

The pirates grab him and throw him on to the survival suit.
103.

But he won't stand still, or drop to his knees. They howl.

MUSI

You make hands-up posture!
PHILLIPS

No!
MUSI

You going against the preaching!
INTERCUT WITH/INT. PHILLIPS HOME - CONTINUING
15 people form a PRAYER CIRCLE, heads bowed. We CUT BACK TO:
INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING (NIGHT)

The pirates try to push Phillips down, try to get his fists
out from under his chin. But he WILL NOT BUDGE.

MUSI
You can't go against the preaching!

Four guys pushing on him, howling. But he just won't comply.
Keeps his fists under his chin... as we:

INTERCUT WITH/INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

MARIAH PHILLIPS, 18, drives too fast - blinking back tears.
Listening to NPR, a report about her father. Just get home.

INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING

Phillips is kicking, twisting, defying, keeping his fists
under his chin. Musi is shouting, spit flying.

MUSI
You make the good posture! Hands up!
You make the good posture!
EXT. UNDERHILL - WOODS - RESUMING

Andrea, running home. She steps onto an icy slick and loses
her footing, falling. She lands in snow. Damn it...

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - RESUMING
15 people, heads down, hands together, praying. We JUMP TO:
INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - SAME

The men of the Maersk - Murphy, ATM, Durell - huddled at a
radio, waiting for word. Mike Perry silently praying...
104.

INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING

Phillips keeps resisting, fighting, kicking, never moving his
fists from under his chin. Pirates howling, spitting, until:

THUMP. Silence. Everything goes white.

Bilal just butt-ended him in the head with the handgun.
Phillips falls forward, on to the suit. Everything foggy.

 

He's on the ritual rug now. Certain he's about to die. The
pirates start WHOOPING again, celebrating... when:

MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

Stop.
(his men eye him)
Look at the rope.

Silence. The pirates examine the three-colored rope they'd
labored so hard to fashion. It has Phillips' BLOOD on it now.
He SPITS on it, weakly, for good measure. Ritual spoiled.

The pirates sag and drift away. Phillips is about to pass out
on the survival suit when he hears:

BRITISH VOICE (THRU RADIO)
Pirate Lifeboat. Pirate lifeboat.
This is Reuters news service. Do you
read? Reuters news--
We STAY WITH PHILLIPS, as we hear Musi answer:
MUSI (0.S., INTO RADIO)
This is pirate lifeboat. We are
surrounded by warships and don't have
time to talk. Please pray for us.
Phillips' eyes begin to close. Then he's out.
INT. PHILLIPS HOME - NIGHT
Everyone's quiet. Andrea enters from the back patio, just as:

MARIAH (0.S.)
Mom?

Mariah, stepping through the front door. Bereft. And barely
visible behind all the food platters and gift baskets.

MARIAH (CONT'D)
Did daddy die?

ANDREA
What? Why?
105.
MARIAH
There's never any food in this house!

A beat... then everyone in here either starts crying or
laughing. Andrea rises, crosses to her daughter.

Mariah collapses in her mother's arms. Both sobbing. CUT TO:
INT. USS BAINBRIDGE - C.I.C. - SAME
Castellano puts down a phone, eyes Garridos and Aboitiz:
CASTELLANO
The President has given the okay. If
we have a clean shot, we take it.
Aboitiz nods. Garridos grabs his radio:
GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
Captain, you're in trouble. Let's
talk.
INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING

Musi heard that. He eyes Phillips, unconscious on the floor.
We... END SEQUENCE. And DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LIFEBOAT - ON THE WATER - MORNING
Day breaks, hot and flat.
EXT. USS BAINBRIDGE - FANTAIL - SAME

We're looking through a SCOPE at the lifeboat. Sunlight
glints off one WINDOW. (The other was knocked out days ago.)

REVEAL Pettis, flat on his belly. In position, as always.
PETTIS (INTO NECK-MIKE)
Boss, I have some minor glare, need a
course correction. Please ask the
Captain to go two degrees starboard.

ABOITIZ (THRU EARPIECE)
Roger that. Two degrees.

INT. LIFEBOAT - SAME

Musi has spent the night working on the lifeboat's ENGINE. He
goes to the Bridge. Hits the ignition. The engine starts.

The sound awakens Phillips - still atop the survival suit,
his head aching. He looks up at Musi.
106.

MUSI
I'm going on the navy boat. To get
our money.

Not a small bit of news. Phillips studies him...

PHILLIPS
It's a ship.

MUSI
Huh?

PHILLIPS

The destroyer, it's a ship. A boat is
something like this, something you
can carry on a ship. Navy guys hate
it when you call their ship a boat.

Musi sighs: Do you ever stop fighting? Phillips shrugs.
MUSI
And we getting a tow. Bainbridge

gonna tow us.

PHILLIPS
Then why fix the engine?

MUSI

They try any tricks, we cut the tow-

line and go into their hull.
Phillips notes the FUEL BUCKETS. They've all been UNCAPPED -
as if about to be turned into weapons. He considers that.
Just then, a SOUND outside: a ZODIAC, pulling up. Musi turns.
EXT. ZODIAC/EXT. LIFEBOAT - ON THE WATER - CONTINUING
Lt. Kinimura, bearing another BOX OF PROVISIONS.

Bainbridge. Musi eyes it from the hatch, his face a mask.

INT. PHILLIPS HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - 5 A.M.
Still dark. Andrea awakens in a panic. Jumps out of bed...
INT. PHILLIPS HOME - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUING

She hurries down the steep steps, zeroes in on a sofa...
where Allison sleeps. Andrea shakes her awake, urgently:

ANDREA

Allison. Allison.
(Allison stirs a bit)

107.

ANDREA (cont'd)
Please wake up. You have to wake up.
I need you.

ALLISON
What? What happened?

ANDREA
I blew it. I blew it!
(no reply)
It's Easter Sunday.

ALLISON
So?

ANDREA
I could've done something. And I blew
it!

 

ALLISON
Andrea, what're you talking about?

ANDREA
There's this homily Richard learned -
from a Priest in Africa. "God is
good, all the time. All the time, God
is good." We say it as a family now;
it's a tradition.

ALLISON
It's lovely.

ANDREA
Don't you understand? It's Easter
Sunday. Every Catholic in Vermont is
going to be in church today. I
could've asked our priest to spread
it around. I could've had it said in
every church up and down the state. I
just wasn't thinking.

Allison pauses a beat, her wheels turning... then:

ALLISON
Let me work on this.

INT. LIFEBOAT —- CONTINUING

Musi gives some last instructions to Najee. Elmi guards
Phillips. Bilal prays, Phillips watching...

PHILLIPS
My wife used to go to church a lot.
She stopped because I didn't wanna
go. That's a regret.

ELMI
Maybe you start now.

In other words, bow down and face Mecca. Phillips shrugs.

PHILLIPS
Can I have that, please?

He's pointing to a CLIPBOARD, hanging on a nail on the
bulkhead, a pen dangling from it. Elmi doesn't respond.

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
I'd like to write something - for my

family.

ELMI
Why?

PHILLIPS
In case.

ELMI

What you tell them, Irish?

PHILLIPS
I dunno. Goodbye? I love you?

INTERCUT WITH/INT. USS BAINBRIDGE - CIC - SAME
Garridos, headphones on, heard that. Just as intended.
INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING

Phillips... almost broadcasting this to the Bainbridge:

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)

I want my wife to know that I'm sorry
for the call she's about to get - and
that I sailed all these years because
I'm a sailor, not because I liked
being away. And I'm sorry I was such
a pain in the ass to my kids about
school - I just, when it was my son's
turn, I didn't want him to have to
spend his life out here like I did,
leaving his family seven or eight
months a year just to make a living.
It costs too much. I made mistakes;
sometimes I treated my children like
they were crew-members.

(just realized)
.--and treated my crew-members like
they were children. I wish I could
undo all that.

He HH HHH HH HK
109.

On the Bainbridge, Garridos is listening. Castellano too.
PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Have to tell them that - have to make
sure they know. Or I won't be clean.
Elmi, nods, hands over the clipboard. Phillips grabs it, as:

Bang. Musi knocks it to the floor, noisily. Rage in his eyes.

MUSI
We all have letters to write.

He turns, heads for the hatch. Phillips calls out to him:

PHILLIPS
Did you say goodbye to your men?

That was an echo - and an accusation. Musi turns...

PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
Captain's supposed to be the last one
off the ship - don't they teach you
that in the Somali Marines?

 

MUSI
Keep talking, Irish.

And out he goes. Najee dogs the hatch shut.

ELMI
Why you talk to him like that?

PHILLIPS
‘Cause I'm never gonna see him again.
And neither are you.
The Pirates don't know how to take that...
EXT. ZODIAC - ON THE WATER - CONTINUING

The TOW-LINE now connects the bow of the lifeboat to the
stern of the Bainbridge, maybe 75 yards from here.

Musi boards the Zodiac; it bears him away...

Elmi tosses a rope at him, angrily.

ELMI (CONT'D)
Here. You tie knot. Like we do.

PHILLIPS
You tie it.

EXT. USS BAINBRIDGE - FANTAIL - MOMENTS LATER

The Sniper-Killer Teams are in their same spots. Four pairs
of men behind crates. Pettis flat on his belly.

ABOITIZ (THRU EARPIECE)
All teams, be advised. Proceeding to
reel in lifeboat now.

Beside one of the crates is a WINCH. The metal TOW-LINE
extends from here to the lifeboat. The winch comes to life,
beginning to pull the lifeboat closer. Slowly... as:

Musi is helped up on to the fantail of the Bainbridge. He
eyes the Sniper-Killer Teams. And that WINCH, slowly pulling
the lifeboat closer.

 

Guilt hits Musi, hard. He's led inside by two SAILORS...

The SEALS behind the rifles never look up from their scopes.
INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING

Elmi slaps Phillips. Two ropes fall to the floor.

ELMI
That's lalil! The ropes can't touch!

PHILLIPS
He cut a deal. He's not coming back.

ELMI
You don't know.
111.

PHILLIPS
I know when he found a pair of new
sandals he took them for himself and
left your friend here barefoot. I
know when he divvied up that thirty
thousand he took all the hundreds and
gave you guys all the fifties.

That landed on Bilal. Elmi turns on him instantly:

ELMI
You don't listen to this!

BILAL
I didn't say anything.

ELMI
You want to be an American sailor?
You want to be lazy and drink beer?
Go ahead, go to movies with him. Be a
nigger. Go ahead.

Elmi shouts at Bilal - in Somali now - Bilal shouting back,
both men rising -- a flashpoint, until:

NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Shut up!

They turn. Najee is on the bridge, glaring at Elmi and Bilal.

NAJEE (SUBTITLED, CONT'D)
Come here.

The two pirates approach the bridge. We FOLLOW...
.+.as they see what he's seeing, the TOW-LINE, tightening.

NAJEE (SUBTITLED, CONT'D)
They're pulling us in.

Fear. Rage. Elmi and Bilal storm at Phillips, the MUZZLES of
their weapons inches from his face, that fast.

ELMI
Unclean place, Phillips. You going to
an unclean place.

PHILLIPS
Fine. Long as I don't have to tie
anymore Goddamn knots.

..-which is when we hear something new from them. They begin
to CHANT. It's low, guttural, ceremonial. A tribal chanting,
their bodies rocking a bit - much scarier than being hit.
112.

They circle him, chanting. Bilal loudest of all.
EXT. USS BAINBRIDGE - FANTAIL - RESUMING
Pettis is flat on his belly, Joon spotting.
PETTIS
Tall Guy just moved from the Con.

Pettis has been in this position forever. We see a single
bead of SWEAT trickling down his forehead...

A MEDIC re-wraps Musi's hand. Musi is silent, troubled...

MUSI
You never said tow-line would be
pulled in.
GARRIDOS
What're you worried about? You're
safe. That was the deal, right?
That sickened Musi. Garridos hands him the CLIPBOARD.
GARRIDOS (CONT'D)
Standard plea agreement. As
discussed.
INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING

The chanting continues. Guns pointed at Phillips.

ELMI
You move here.

He gestures to a seat. Phillips moves to the seat.

ELMI (CONT'D)
You pick that up!

He gestures to a cloth. Phillips picks it up.

ELMI (CONT'D)
You put it over there!

Phillips does so - then stands up tall, sweat pouring down.

113.

PHILLIPS
Please let me write to them. Please
let me say goodbye...

ELMI

The chanting continues. Najee nods to Bilal, who puts a
BLINDFOLD on Phillips...

NAJEE
Animal! Lazy animal!

That WINCH keeps cranking, slowly, drawing in the line.

We STAY HERE, TIGHT... close enough to find that single bead
of sweat, now dripping down Pettis' forehead, near his eye...

PETTIS (CONT'D)
DJ, I've got some perspiration on my
forehead. Need a hand with it.

Joon, without a hint of awkwardness, wipes the bead of sweat
from Pettis' forehead. Pettis doesn't move a muscle...

INT. LIFEBOAT - SAME

Phillips puts his forehead to his shoulder, shaking the
blindfold off. Elmi, livid, slugs him - puts it back on.

Andrea hits the speaker button...

off, starts walking toward the aft hatch. Huh??? *

ELMI

PHILLIPS

I'm going for a swim.
ELMI

You sit!
PHILLIPS

You sit.
ELMI

We shoot you!
PHILLIPS

Then shoot me, you pussies. I'm out

He takes one more step before... POP POP POP - Najee fires
the AK-47. Rounds ricochet off the ceiling. Phillips stops.

Silence. Najee eyes Elmi and Bilal... then:

NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
Cut the tow-line.

ABOITIZ (THRU EARPIECES)
Affirmative. We have that.

Then Pettis sees something that makes his eyes go wide:
PETTIS

Boss, we have movement on the deck of
the lifeboat.

 

Sure enough, Bilal emerges from the bow-hatch of the
lifeboat, releasing the tow-line from the Bainbridge.

 

PETTIS/JOON/RAMOS/ETC.
They've cut the tow. Repeat, lifeboat
is not in tow at this time.

Everything ratchets up. The spotters and shooters adjust
their scopes. Fast.

INT. LIFEBOAT - SAME
Najee hits the IGNITION. The lifeboat engine rumbles awake.
Phillips whips around - his eyes on those FUEL BUCKETS in the
nose of the ship as Elmi grabs him, pushes him back on to the
survival suit, knocking Phillips down to his knees. We hear:
CASTELLANO (THRU RADIO)
Lifeboat! What's going on in there?
We're hearing reports of gunfire and
a severed tow-line. Come in.
Najee grins. Bilal re-enters from the bow, shuts the hatch.

Najee have dropped too, breathing their last - the boat's
throttle out of their reach...

Before Phillips can react, he hears two launches racing
toward this lifeboat. That fast, the fore and aft hatches

Is it true?!

ALLISON
It's true.

Andrea throws her head back, grabs the kids. They're at a
loss - but they hang on. She starts crying, as:

...the PHONE RINGS. Andrea's head snaps toward it. Her eyes
meet Allison's. Andrea gets to the phone, answers it.

ANDREA (INTO PHONE)
Hello?

PHILLIPS (THRU PHONE)
(Barry White voice)
Is your husband at home?
At last, the call she's been praying for.

ANDREA (INTO PHONE)
Richard?! Richard?!

PHILLIPS (THRU PHONE)
Hi, Honey.

ANDREA (INTO PHONE)
OhMyGod! OhMyGod! Kids!

They rush forward, listening in. Laughing. Crying. Then:
ANDREA (PHONE, CONT'D)
Richard! What were you thinking
getting into that lifeboat!?
Phillips laughs, we DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BURLINGTON AIRPORT - TARMAC - DAY

Andrea, Dan, and Mariah wait on the tarmac. A WELCOME HOME
CAPTAIN PHILLIPS banner behind them.

.»+.aS a private JET, provided by MAERSK, taxis toward them.

DAN
Mom. I can't stand here. Can I run?
120.
ANDREA
Run.
He starts to run. Mariah too. Then Andrea. As we CUT TO:
EXT. TARMAC - TEETERBORO AIRPORT, N.J. - SAME

Another JET taxis to a stop. Doors open. Garridos and TWO
FEDERAL MARSHALLS emerge... with a prisoner, in cuffs:

It's Musi. No one here to greet him but more COPS.
EXT. BURLINGTON AIRPORT - TARMAC - RESUMING

The private jet comes to a stop. Its doors open. Phillips
emerges, jumps down the steps. They all fly into his arms.

A LOUD CHEER ERUPTS - as we reveal A THOUSAND NEIGHBORS, all
here to greet him. Everyone wearing a yellow ribbon.

Big family hug. Phillips holding on tight, nothing said. The
CHEER CONTINUES, one thousand voices. He's home.

And as that lands across his face we FREEZE FRAME... then:

FADE OUT...
