SLAY THE DREAMER
FADE IN:
INT. CHURCH -- MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE -- DAY - - 1976

The last rays of sunset stream through a large stained glass
window. The resonant SOUNDS of the CHOIR are infused with an
unmistakable gospel spirit

The choir, like the CONGREGATION, is almost all black. The
hymn reaches its rousing conclusion. A distinguished looking
MINISTER, mid-forties, finishes his sermon.

MINISTER
... yes, we have been wounded. The
forces of darkness have conspired
to turn what we fought for in the
'50's and '60's, justice, dignity,
compassion - into the shame and
poverty of the 1970's. There are
some who say that we should give up
hope, that we will never see the
blessed community we dreamt of.
But remember - you cannot wait for
the Lord, you must seek him. So
too you cannot wait for justice.
Don't give into despair. Have the
courage to seek, for in searching
you will find dignity and the light
of the Lord will be upon you.

CONGREGATION
(in unison)
Amen!

MINISTER
May your love of God Almighty give
you peace as you leave this place
and set out into the world.

CONGREGATION
(in unison)
Amen!

As the CHOIR begins the exit hymn ("Marching to Zion"), the
MINISTER moves down from the podium and begins to greet his
parishioners.

EXT. CHURCH RECTORY - - NIGHT

A flood light illuminates the night. Reverend Lawson emerges
carrying his homework.
He's intercepted by IONE TURNER, two hundred pounds of love.
She engulfs him with a hug.

IONE
Reverend, you sure did the Lord's
work today, and then some!

Pulling a sweet potato pie from her bag.

LAWSON
Sister Ione, you're too kind.

IONE
And I know you loves sweet
potatoes. He sings like a bird.

LAWSON
What...?

Ione pulls her chunky grandson, a ten year-old version of
herself, from behind her mammoth flanks.

TONE
My grandson, Willie
(prodding the boy)
Willie... Eye On The Sparrow...

LAWSON
Y'know, Brother Boxer has choir
practice every...

WILLIE
(singing badly)
I sing because I'm happy, I sing
because I'm free... etc.

LAWSON
Oh boy, Brother Boxer's gotta hear this...

He tries to extricate himself, but she snags him and pulls
another pie from her paper bag.

TONE
Got a peach cobbler here, too,
Reverend. I was thinking maybe a
solo next Sunday...

LAWSON
Brother Boxer has complete control
of solos. But... you never know...

He makes his escape, heading toward the parking lot, laden
with desserts.
IN THE SHADOWS

A FIGURE emerges and moves in the direction of the parking
lot. Soft-soled shoes move silently across the pavement.

ON LAWSON'S VW BUG

The Minister puts his work into the car, then stops. He
senses a presence. He turns around slowly, his face
registers concern.

MINISTER'S POV

A middle-aged WHITE WOMAN approaches. She clutches a large
handbag. She stops.

WHITE WOMAN
Reverend Lawson?

LAWSON
(tentative)
Yes...

The Woman reaches into her purse, fumbles for something. A
gun? No. She finally pulls out a SMALL FOLDER.

WHITE WOMAN
I found her. They had her under a
different name. It was like she
didn't exist.

She offers the file to Lawson.
CUT TO:
INT. COURTHOUSE - - DAY

The corridor is crowded. The door to the men's room swings
open. A handsome gentleman exits. The man is HIRAM EVANS,
elegantly dressed, late fifties, a prominent African-American
lawyer in Memphis. Evans heads toward Courtroom 4.

LAWSON (0.S.)
Hiram!

Evans turns to see Lawson emerge from the crowd. These two
are old friends. Evans is still moving toward the courtroom.
Lawson follows.

EVANS
God-damn brother Lawson, you still
growing or am I shrinking?
A BAILIFF

LAWSON
(grinning)
New boots. It's the heels. And if
you keep taking the Lord's name in
vain, I'm gonna put you on the
Raffle Committee with Sister Ione.

EVANS
Cruel and unusual punishment...

LAWSON
Hiram, I need your help...

sticks his head out of courtroom 4.

BAILIFF
Everybody for Judge Harper's
courtroom, we're back in session.

EVANS
Gotta go. Harper is about to rule
in my favor. He's tough as a two
dollar steak - don't want to keep
him waitin'.

LAWSON
Hiram... We've found Grace!
EVANS
(chuckles)

I should hope so, Reverend!

LAWSON
Grace Walden. She's been locked up
in the State Asylum for almost a
decade. I need you to get her out.

EVANS
Brother, times have changed. We
ain't marching any more.

LAWSON
Hiram, she's the key. We gotta get
her out.

EVANS
If you can't let this go, then what
you need is one of them.
(he indicates the white
faces in court)
You and I together wouldn't get
past the back door.
LAWSON
You're the sharpest lawyer I know.

EVANS
Flattery ain't gonna do it, Jim.
There are times when a white face
is the right face. Gotta go.
(a smile)
And Jim ... we don't need any more
martyrs. Watch your back, brother.

Evans turns abruptly and heads back into the courtroom.
Lawson stands alone. This isn't the first time he has been
rebuffed.

INT. COURTROOM - - DAY

The JUDGE eyes Hiram as he returns, sitting next to his
wealthy white client.

JUDGE
Nice of you to rejoin us, Mr. Evans.

LAWSON enters the courtroom, and sits towards the back.

EVANS
The matter is clear as a screen door,
your honor, The Tennessee code
annotated is explicit as to the
points we've presented. We therefore
rest on the briefs submitted and ask
for a directed verdict.

JUDGE
Mr. Morgan?

The Judge looks at CLAY MORGAN JR. Morgan is a corporate
lawyer in his late thirties who talks Southern, dresses
London, and charms all the time. Morgan gets up from behind
the defense table. He knows that he's holding a busted
straight but still is compelled to strut

MORGAN
Thank you, you're Honor. I realize
my esteemed colleague has presented
a compelling case...
BOOM. Morgan turns to the origin of the sound.
MORGAN'S POV

The rear doors to the courtroom SLAM shut. Enter JEFFREY
JENKINS, walking quickly, holding a large legal volume.
6.

Jeff's hair is a little too long and his clothes reflect his
indifference to appearance or trends. Jeff walks up to the
defense table and sets the book down.

JEFF
(to Morgan, sotto voce)
I've got to show you something.

ON MORGAN

MORGAN
Excuse me your honor.
(irritated)
What?

Morgan walks back to the defense table. Jeff slides the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to him.

ON LAWSON

: (MORE ) cea .
From Lawson's distant POV, Morgan appears to be assisting his
awkward junior associate.

ON MORGAN AND JEFF
Morgan's expression changes from irritated to inspired.

MORGAN

Your Honor, Please excuse my young
associate. As I was saying, our
research shows that the question of
jurisdiction enjoys precedence.

(picks up the book)
Title 28, Section 1441[a] and Rule
81[c] of the federal rules of...

JUDGE
Mr. Morgan, maybe y'all haven't
noticed, but we are ina state
court. The Federal Court is down
the block.

LAUGHTER from the room. Lawson watches, intrigued.

MORGAN

Good point, Your Honor. And that's
where this whole shebang oughta'
be. According to Title 28, we do
not require an order of this court
to remove this case to the United
States District Court. That court
is, as you noted, just down the
block.

(to Jeff)
MORGAN(CONT'D)
Jeff, why don't you pass that
Federal Rules book to Judge Harper.

Jeff hands the book to the Bailiff who passes it to the
Judge. The Judge quickly reads the passage to himself.

JUDGE
Mr. Evans, this court no longer has
jurisdiction. Next case.

Lawson takes notice. Evans' confident demeanor has given way
to resignation. Evans walks over to Morgan who is just
standing. Evans offers his hand in congratulations.

EVANS
Good job, Clay. You could steal
the flowers off a dead man's grave.
See you in Federal Court.

MA@BRAN
Ready when you are, counselor

Jeff watches Morgan bask in victory. As Hiram turns to leave
he notices Lawson approaching the defense table. Hiram winks
at Lawson, then exits. Lawson holds out his hand to Clay.

LAWSON
Congratulations, Mr. Morgan. Very
impressive.

MORGAN
Thank you, Reverend.

LAWSON
You have a gift. Be nice to see
that gift working to help the less
fortunate.

Morgan puts his files in his briefcase. Snaps it shut,
looking for a graceful exit.

MORGAN
It does, I assure you. But right
now I'm so busy I should be twins.

LAWSON
I could use your help. A civil
matter. A woman, wrongfully
incarcerated...

MORGAN
(to Jeff)
Give the Reverend my business card.
(to Lawson)
MORGAN (CONT'D)
I'm already late. Why don't you
call me at the office.

Morgan picks up his case and leaves.
INT. LAW OFFICE -- THE NEXT DAY

Classy surroundings. Georgian furniture and wood paneling.
Start CLOSE on the receptionist, CYBIL STURGIS, 50-something
and very prim. She's plugged into a hands-free PBX.

CYBIL
Good morning. Branson, Davis and
Douglas. One moment please. I'll
transfer you.

LAWSON (0.S.)
Miss...

REVEAL Jim Lawson. He's been waiting patiently for some
time. He gets up from the stiff couch and approaches the
receptionist.

LAWSON
(continuing)
...Do you think you could try Mr.
Morgan again?

CYBIL
Sir, I've told you. Mr. Morgan is
in conference.

INT. CLAY MORGAN'S OFFICE - DAY
A toy basketball arches through a small hoop.

MORGAN (0.S.)
Nothing but net!

Pull back to reveal the plush office, the carefully appointed
space that befits a junior partner of a prestigious white-
shoe firm. Morgan sits at his desk, playing toy basketball
with CHUCK ARMSTRONG (39), another rising legal star.

MORGAN
(continuing)
The crowd goes wild. That's
another Jackson, pal.

Armstrong hands twenty dollars to Morgan. There is a KNOCK
at the door.
MORGAN (CONT'D)
(continuing)
Come in.

Jeff enters carrying a sizeable legal brief.

JEFF
I've finished the response to the
Conway case.
(to Armstrong)
Morning Chuck.

Armstrong just nods. Morgan reaches for the brief.

MORGAN
You've finished the first draft of
the response.

CYBIL (V.0)
(on the intercom)
Mr. Morgan, I just want to remind
you that Reverend Lawson is still
waiting.

MORGAN
Cybil, I'm busy. Tell him to leave
the file. I'll get back to him.
Please.

JEFF
Wrongful incarceration. It sounds
pretty straightforward.

Morgan is surprised that Jeff even knows about the case, let
alone has an opinion.

MORGAN
Nothing's straightforward in the law,
Jeffrey. Didn't your distinguished
daddy tell you that? If the state
took the time to put some old black
lady in the basket factory, there
must be a damn good reason.

JEFF
Maybe just look through the file...

MORGAN
It's pro bono, kid. Gotta bill the
hours or hit the showers. Branson
will never go for it. But hell, go
ahead. Present it at the Partners'
meeting. It's all yours.
10.

Morgan retrieves another toy ball and shoots.

MORGAN
(continuing)
He shoots, he scores!

BRANSON (V.0.)
You are to be commended. Billing
for the quarter is outpacing the
same quarter '75 by ten percent...

INT. LAW FIRM CONFERENCE ROOM -- LATE THAT AFTERNOON

Start on WILLIAM 'BILL' BRANSON, a southern gentleman with a
shark's toothy smile. Senior and Junior partners are seated
at the table, while Associates sit behind them along the
wall. Jeff is seated on the outer perimeter, next to KATY
BOLTON, an attractive, poised, twenty-six year old, and the
only black face in the room. Katy is taking notes ona
yellow pad.

BRANSON
Let's keep the billing hours up.
(a beat)

If there's nothing else, I'd like
to adjourn.

ANGLE the room as Jeff slowly stands.

JEFF
Uh... Mr. Branson... I gave your
secretary a file on Grace Walden.
She was not represented by an
attorney or examined by a
psychiatrist. I was wondering if
you had a chance to look at it.

BRANSON
Yes, Jeffrey, I read it.
JEFF
Uh... According to my preliminary

research, there was no apparent
reason why she was placed in that
institution and is still there
eight years later.

BRANSON
We're not talking fee here, are we?

JEFF
I believe she is indigent. We were
contacted by her Minister.
11.

MORGAN
Where do we draw the line, Jeff?
We're in the business of billable
hours. We're not storefront lawyers.

A painful pause. To everyone's surprise, Katy speaks up.

KATY
A case like this could land us an
article in The Memphis Lawyer, sir
It could actually bring in more
business. The Reverend is quite
well known.

JEFF
(grateful)
Yes... yes. It's James Lawson.
He's a friend of my father's.
MORGAN
In that event, maybe I should take
a look.
BRANSON

If I recall correctly, Clay, your
billing rate is somewhat higher
than Jeff's.

(to Morgan)
This firm can afford ten hours for
better relations with the Negro
community.

(to Katy)
You'll keep the editors of The
Memphis Lawyer informed of our
commitment, and due to the nature
of the case, maybe you should
assist Jeff on this one.

 

EXT. CORRIDOR - - DAY

Jeff sidles up to Katy as the other lawyers exit and disperse.

JEFF
(on the move)
Thanks... Branson can be a little

unreceptive at times.

KATY
It's a good case. It's the kind of
thing we should do more of. We
already have enough meters running
in this building.
12.

Clay moves past on his way to his office.

JEFF
Listen... Katy... I was thinking,
since we're working together, we
could stop by Bolivar State Hospital
on Saturday and see Miz Walden.

Clay looks on, amused by Jeff's apparent awkwardness.

JEFF
(continuing)
Then, if it's okay with you, we
could swing by and enjoy some of my
Dad's stringy barbecue. He's
cooking. It's kinda informal.

KATY
Go to your father's for dinner?

Clay has paused in his doorway to watch, grins.

CLAY
He shoots. He scores.

CUT TO:
INT. INSTITUTION -- JEFF'S P.O.V.

Dim lighting, high ceilings, peeling paint, stone floors
narrow wooden benches - spare forms and haunting shadows
abound. Silence and echoes including JEFF'S OWN FOOTSTEPS
striking the stone, as he walks, now tentatively, into

THE LOBBY

JEFF stops and becomes aware of another SOUND: the CLICKING of a
WOODEN TOY in the hands of a solitary inmate seated on a bench.

The inmate is BRIAN GREENE, between 40 and 60, dressed in an
institutional cotton bathrobe. His eyes are unfocused.

Jeff continues on to the empty Reception Window and
Information Desk. His mood is darkening, his breathing
reacting to the heavy antiseptic smell of the place.

CLOSE-UP on an old yellowing index card taped to the window:

CARD:
"IMPORTANT NOTICE: GRACE WALDEN IS
TO RECEIVE NO VISITORS AND NO
TELEPHONE CALLS. JUNE 6, 1968."
13.

Jeff studies the note... Then reaches through an opening in
the glass partition, picks up a Visitor's Pass, and puts it
on his lapel. He turns and approaches the inmate on the
bench, and offers his hand.

JEFF
Hello. I'm an attorney. Jeffrey
Jenkins. I came to see Grace
Walden.

The SOUND of the wooden TOY stops.

GREENE
Esquire. Jeffrey Jenkins, Esquire.
I'm Brian Greene. Green like the
color green. But there's an extra
"e", It's at the end. I'm English.
So it's not like the color green.

JEFF
Mr. Greene, do you know Grace
Walden?

GREENE

Walden. And that's spelled "e" "n"
not "o" "nh"

JEFF
You know where I can find her?
GREENE
"Oo" "hn" 4s Swedish -- "e" "n" is
Danish... She's in 14. Right down

that hall and to the right. "0" "n"
is also your Norwegian --

JEFF
Thank you, Mr. Greene.

Jeff walks down the hall, turns right and comes to a door
WARD 3 -- ROOMS 1-18: "NO ENTRY WITHOUT VISITOR'S PERMIT"
Jeff checks his stolen permit and continues into the ward.
INT. ROOM 14

GRACE WALDEN is seated on the bed, dressed in a robe, pajamas
and slippers. She is white. Grace is fifty-five but looks
at least twenty years older. She has no teeth, wears no

makeup, and her sparse hair is white and wispy. She has the
vacant look caused by heavy medication.
14.

JEFF
(expecting a black woman)
Oh, excuse me ma'am. I was looking
for a Mrs. Grace Walden. I was told
she was in Room 14, but...

GRACE
Can't be sure anymore. What with
all that's been happening...

JEFF
Do you know Grace Walden?

GRACE
That's me. For all the good it's
done.

Grace looks up, gives a toothless smile. Jeff reacts.
Awkwardly, he pulls out a business card and hands it to her.

JEFF
I am Jeffrey D. Jenkins with the
firm of Branson, Davis and Douglas.
(Grace just stares)
Reverend Lawson asked me to come
see you... You know Reverend James
Lawson?

She shakes her head no; her eyes unfocused.

JEFF
(continuing)
I understand that you have been
put here without benefit of
counsel...

GRACE
Ain't no benefits in this place.
You got that right.

Silence. A WILD LAUGH cackles from a far ward. Jeff takes
out a small tape recorder.

JEFF

Do you mind if I use a tape
recorder? It'll save me taking
notes.

(she nods, he starts the

recorder)
Why did you get put in here? Can
you remember?
15.

GRACE
Yep.

JEFF
Can you tell me?

GRACE
Cause Charlie told them. Not me. I
wouldn't lie.

JEFF
Charlie? Who's Charlie?

GRACE
Threw him outa Jim's. He's in the
Hornet's Nest now.

INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR

Two guards, EARL AND TRENT, are walking. They wear non-
specific police uniforms. Earl is bald. Trent is fat. They
hear VOICES down the hall, react. They move toward Room 14.

JEFF (V.0.)
When did you last see Charlie?

INT. ASYLUM - GRACE'S ROOM

GRACE
I called him once. Can't call him
no more...

The door to the room is pushed open and the Guards enter.
Earl sees the tape recorder.

EARL
She's not supposed t'have any
visitors. Where'd you get that pass.

JEFF

I'm her attorney.
TRENT

She doesn't have an attorney.
JEFF

She does if she says she does.
GRACE

She sure does, if she says she

does.

Jeff looks at Grace.
16.

EARL
The Director is goin' to want t'see
you. Bring the recorder.

JEFF
I'll see you later, Grace.

GRACE
We'll see.

The two Guards follow Jeff out of the ward.
INT. THE CORRIDOR

Suddenly the Guards brace Jeff and rip his tape recorder
away .

TRENT
(gesturing to Jeff)
This way to the Director's office.

JEFF
Yes sir. Right behind you.

Jeff pretends a meek compliance, then, with a fast pivot, he
grabs back the recorder, leaps clear of the Guards and runs.
Jeff sprints full speed down the corridor, past Brian Greene,
and toward the main doors.

EXT. HOSPITAL

Bucolic. Birds CHIRPING. Jeff's yellow TR3 is parked not
far from the main building. Katy sits in the driver's seat,
a legal brief is propped against the steering wheel. She is
carefully revising the document

JEFF (0.S.)
(shouting to Katy)
Start the car! Start the car

Katy looks up. Jeff has just run out of the main entrance.
He leaps down a set of stairs and rushes toward the car.

KATY
Jeff, what...?

Earl and Trent in pursuit. Jeff yanks open the door

JEFF
Go, Katy. Just go! Go!

Katy puts the car in gear but the Guards race to ten feet in
front of the car. They throw their hands up in a "stop" signal.
17.

JEFF (CONT'D)
Drive. Step on it. They'll move.

KATY
How do you know?

JEFF
‘Cause they're not crazy. Go!

Katy floors it. The Guards dive away at the last instant.
Katy races toward the highway.

INT. TR3 -- ACCESS ROAD -- DRIVING - - DAY

KATY
What's goingmoRE?!

As Katy drives onto the highway, Jeff removes the tape from
the recorder and hides it in her purse. He takes a blank
tape from the glove compartment and puts it into the
recorder. He puts the recorder on the dash in plain sight. A
SIREN announces the Guards' pursuit. Katy sees the POLICE CAR
in the rearview mirror.

KATY
(continuing)
What the hell'd you do back there?
JEFF
I interviewed my client! Pull

over.
The car pulls over. The Guards approach, guns drawn.

TRENT
Out of the car, both of you.

JEFF
Yes, sir. But can I ask one
question first, Officer? Do you
work for the state police?

EARL
"Special Officer."

JEFF
What does that mean, "Special
Officer"? You sure it doesn't mean
"Hospital Security"?
(Trent hesitates)
18.
JEFF(CONT'D)
‘Cause if it does, I believe your
jurisdiction extends just as far as
the hospital grounds -- and no
farther -- right? Trust me on
this. If you pull us out of this
car, it's technically a kidnapping
‘cause you got zero authority here
on this highway.

Katy looks with admiration. She sees a new Jeff.

JEFF
(continuing)
Now unless you want her to drive
right over those shiny brogans, I
suggest you step back, officer
‘cause we're going now.

The Guards step back slowly in apparent defeat. But then,
Earl suddenly reaches into the car and grabs the tape
recorder off the dash.

Jeff stares as the two Guards hurry away, get into their
vehicle and drive off. Now the highway is empty. Katy
reaches into her purse and withdraws the tape.

KATY

What the hell is on this thing?
JEFF

I don't know... gibberish.

(off Katy's look)
But who the hell is Grace Walden?

CUT TO:
INT. N.D. OFFICE - - DAY

An angular MAN is backlit against a window with venetian
blinds. We HEAR a door open and an AGENT enters INTO FRAME.
Drops a file on the desk.

AGENT
Sir, the incident at Bolivar. We
traced the young man. A lawyer.
Working for James Lawson.

BACKLIT MAN
(a long pause)
That's unfortunate. Maybe the old
Reverend needs a reminder.

CUT TO:
19.

EXT. LUCAS JENKINS' ESTATE - NIGHT

Quintessentially Southern. Neatly landscaped and beautifully
lit, it leans magnificently against a moonlit sky.

EXT. JENKINS'S ESTATE - POOL AREA - NIGHT

Tight on a fire. PULL BACK to reveal LUCAS JENKINS presiding
over the enormous brick barbeque. Lucas is 60,
distinguished. Katy and Jeff stand close by. HAROLD, a
black butler with alert eyes, wearing a white coat, hovers.

LUCAS
Hope these sirloins aren't too
thin. Harold picked 'em up at the
Piggly Wiggly.

HAROLD
Sorry, sir. It was all they had.

Harold's eyes connect with Katy's. He holds out a platter
Lucas removes the three steaks from the grill.

LUCAS
I wasn't making a criticism,
Harold. You pick 'em and I cook
‘em. It's a Wednesday night
tradition. Let's see if we can cut
these without a chainsaw.

Harold moves off to set the nearby table. Katy stands ina
white dress. She looks ravishing. Jeff is in a blazer

LUCAS
(continuing)
So, Miss Bolton, Jeff tells me your
father is in transportation.

KATY
(a glance at Jeff)
After a fashion, I guess. He, uh
drives a City bus.

LUCAS
A bus. Jeff tells me you're taking
the bar exam next month.

KATY
Did Jeff tell you - Branson gave
him his first solo client.
20.

LUCAS
(to Jeff)
A courtroom situation?

JEFF
Just a motion to install due
process.

LUCAS
Did Bill Branson reset your hourly
rate for a solo court appearance?

JEFF
It's pro-bono. Your friend,
Reverend Lawson, brought the case
to us.

Lucas wrinkles his brow slightly, then motions to the table.

LUCAS
Why don't we get started?
(they walk to the table)
What's the client's name?

JEFF
Grace Walden.

Harold is pouring the wine. He hears the name, looks up
momentarily, catching Lucas' eye. Everyone sits, an
appetizer at each place. Katy glances down, puzzled, at her
place setting. There are four forks. She doesn't know which
to use.

KATY
(stalling)
Looks wonderful.

HAROLD
Oh, my, that fork looks tarnished.

Harold, the master of subtlety, picks up the correct fork
polishes it and hands it back to Katy.

KATY
(grateful)
Thank you.

LUCAS
Have you met your client yet?

JEFF
Sure did.
21.

LUCAS
And she seems sane?

JEFF
To be honest, Dad, she seemed a
little disoriented...

LUCAS
Maybe she's where she belongs.

JEFF
She was denied due process. And
before I could finish my interview,
two guards ran me off. Confiscated
my tape recorder.

LUCAS
That's strange. Whatever it is,
I'm sure you'll do the right thing.
Remember, it's just one case.

JEFF
My first case.

LUCAS
The first of many.

Lucas cuts the steak. MOVE IN ON the knife.
INT. JENKINS ESTATE - LATER

The ornate grandfather clock CHIMES. Lucas and Katy walk
through the foyer. Jeff is absent for the moment.

LUCAS
The night's young, but old men
retire early. It was a pleasure
meeting you, Katy.

KATY
Thank you, sir.

They walk to the front door and out onto the veranda.
LUCAS
When I look at you, I seea
fighter. Maybe you could teach
some of that to my son.
ANGLE -- FRONT DOOR

Jeff and Harold are exiting the library. Jeff is putting on
his jacket. Harold holds Katy's coat.
22.

HAROLD
Mighty fine young lady, Mr. Jeff.
Smart as a whip and pretty enough
to make a man plow through a stump.

JEFF
Sure is, Papa H... but, we're just
working together.

HAROLD
(knowingly)
Hmm...Well, now that they adjusted
your hourly rate, you ever need to
unwind, lose some of that new
money, I'm still at The Rack and
Cue every Tuesday.

The walk out the door onto the veranda.

LUCAS (V.0.)
Son of a bitch!!

INT. LAWSON CHURCH - NIGHT

Lucas and Lawson walk down the dark church corridor. The
lights are off. Lucas is fuming. Lawson has a flashlight.

LAWSON
Lucas, calm down. And watch your
language.
(calls out)
Clarence, call the power company
again. I need these lights back on.

LUCAS
You're crazier than she is.

A Choir is rehearsing in an adjacent area by candlelight.

LUCAS
(continuing)
. Why didn't you come to me first?

LAWSON
I did. Eight years ago. And you
didn't want to hear about it!

LUCAS
I wasn't alone. Every reputable
lawyer in town turned you down. So,
now you've gone to my son. Behind
my back! You know this could
destroy him.
23.

LAWSON
I didn't want him to go up to
Bolivar. I just wanted him to file
the writ... Grace has been locked
away for almost a decade...

LUCAS
James, you don't give a damn about
that crazy old white woman! You
just want to reopen the case.

LAWSON
Those efforts aren't mutually
exclusive!

LUCAS
So you came to my son, to my only
son...

Lawson looks at his old friend.

LAWSON
He wasn't my first choice, Lucas.

LUCAS
You can't do this. After all we've
meant to one another... all we've
been through. Promise me you'll
get another lawyer. Promise me,
Jim. I need your word.

Lawson hesitates.
INT. LAWSON'S HOME - LATE THE NEXT DAY

A modest home. A LOUD KNOCK. The SOUND of youthful
footsteps approaching.

Lawson's nine-year-old son, SETH, complete with a Jackson
Five Afro, is about to open it, when DOROTHY LAWSON (30s)
strides into the scene.

DOROTHY
Seth, I told you before... Don't
open the door to strangers.

She moves her son back with her hand. She looks through the
fish eye in the door.

DOROTHY'S POV: JEFF IN DISTORTION
24.

DOROTHY
(continuing)
Who is it?

JEFF (0.S.)
It's Jeffrey Jenkins, Mrs. Lawson.
I'm here to see Jim.

Dorothy opens the door

DOROTHY
Jeffrey Jenkins. Last time I saw
you, I think you were still in
short pants.

JEFF
I still wear ‘em, but now it's just
to play ball.

DOROTHY
Good, someone needs to put the
Reverend in his place. He's out
back, shooting hoops.

Jeff enters the home and Dorothy begins leading him through
the neat interior. Seth runs ahead.

DOROTHY
(continuing)
Sorry about the door... It's
just... you can't be too careful.

There've been some threatening
phone calls.

EXT. LAWSON BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

A basketball arcs through the sky. WOOSH. Nothing but net.
The shooter moves in to retrieve the ball - it's Jim Lawson,
dressed in a damp shirt, jeans and tennis shoes.

SETH (0.S.)
Gimme the ball, Dad!

The back door flies open. Seth comes running out of the
house. Jim looks up to see his son - followed by Jeff and
Dorothy. Jim hesitates, bounces the ball.

LAWSON
Seth, take the ball inside.
(tosses it to him)
You've got to practice the piano. And
I need to be alone with Mr. Jenkins.
25.

Jeff walks toward Jim. Seth takes the ball into the house.
Dorothy follows her son, closing the door behind her.

JEFF
I went to Bolivar.

LAWSON
That's more than I asked for.

JEFF
I wanted to see for myself. I made
a tape recording...

LAWSON
You did what?

JEFF
Grace kinda rambled. But something
strange is going on.

A weary Jim moves to a picnic bench, sits down.

LAWSON
It doesn't matter.
(Jeff looks confused)
I've contacted another attorney to
take the case. I'm sorry. I'll
see that your law firm gets paid
for your time.

JEFF
Is this because I never tried a
case before?

LAWSON
It's because of a lot of things. I
made a mistake. I'd need you to
return that tape.

JEFF
But I can do this.

LAWSON
You've done enough. Just return
the tape. I'm sorry.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

A radio somewhere is BLARING out a disco beat. Katy is
waiting with several files.
26.

PULL BACK to see out the glassed front door. Jeff pulls up
in his TR3, gets out, comes up the walk. Katy turns as he
enters.

KATY
I brought the stuff you wanted. But do
you mind telling me what's going on.

JEFF
Thanks. I'm sorry. It's all
coming unwound.

KATY
What's coming unwound?

JEFF
Come on up. I need a beer. And
you deserve an explanation.
KATY
(unsure)
You think I should?
JEFF
Come on. You won't believe what
just happened.
They MOVE OUT OF SHOT and head upstairs
INT. HALLWAY - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jeff and Katy walk up the stairs. He moves along to his
door, takes out his key.

JEFF
. When Lawson found out I went to
see Grace, he got really pissed.

Across the hall, a neighbor is peeking through a chain locked
door. Katy turns and catches her disapproving look.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

Katy and Jeff enter. The interior is dark. Jeff flips on
the light switch and nothing happens.

JEFF
These are out.

A lamp comes at camera.
NEW ANGLE - JEFF & KATY - WIDEN

The lamp smashes into Jeff and a man shoves him.
27.
Jeff falls into Katy and they both go down. The man bolts out
of the room and into the hall.
Before Katy can react, Jeff gives chase out into the dark
hallway, running down the stairs, taking them three and four
at a time, tripping, falling, rolling, coming to his feet in
the entry and out the front door
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeff runs out into the street just as a gray sedan takes off,
heading right at him.

ANGLE - JEFF AND SEDAN

Jeff dives up onto the sidewalk to avoid being hit. The
sedan roars away, up the street

JEFF'S POV - LICENSE PLATE HOLDER
It is empty - no plate.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
Jeff comes into the apartment. He has a cut over his eye
where the lamp hit him. The lights are now on. The place
has been thoroughly ransacked.
JEFF
Gone... he got away. You got the
lights back on...
KATY
He only unscrewed the bulbs.
(she sees his cut)
You okay?

JEFF
Yeah.

She hands a tissue to Jeff who moves to the telephone.
JEFF
(continuing; dials 0)
Operator, connect me with the police.

KATY
Wait a minute.

She depresses the phone button. Jeff is confused.
28.

KATY (CONT'D)
(continuing)
Look at this place. Tv's still
here... stereo...

She moves to a ransacked dresser.

KATY
(continuing)
Gold cufflinks, watch...
(holds them up)
Not much of a burglar.

JEFF
(puzzled)
What the hell's going on?

KATY
Where's the tape?

JEFF
With the rest of the case material -
- at the office.

INT. LAW OFFICE - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a tape player.
GRACE (V.0.)
Yep.
JEFF (V.0.)
Can you tell me?

GRACE (V.0.)
Cause Charlie told them. Not me. I

wouldn't lie.
Katy and Jeff are listening, exchanging glances.

JEFF (V.0.)
Charlie? Who's Charlie?

GRACE (V.0.)
Threw him outa Jim's. He's in the
Hornet's Nest now.

Jeff reaches out and shuts off the tape.
JEFF

Who's Charlie? And what did he
tell them?
29.
KATY
And what's the Hornet's Nest?
EXT. HORNET'S NEST - NIGHT
Tight on an old neon sign that depicts a wasp. The Hornet's
Nest is a grimy bar located by the river. PULL BACK to show
Jeff looking at the sign. He moves inside.

INT. HORNETS NEST - NIGHT

There are a few listless drunks leaning at the bar. Jeff
moves to the BARTENDER, (60, decrepit)

JEFF
I'm looking for Charlie.

BARTENDER
Charlie who?

JEFF
Old Charlie. Hangs out here.

BARTENDER
What are you drinking?

JEFF
Two of whatever Charlie drinks.

The bartender pulls two long necks from the cooler. Jeff
drops a twenty on the counter.

BARTENDER
Hey, C.Q.

An old drunk looks up from a booth in the back.

CHARLIE
Huh?
JEFF
(to the bartender)
Thanks.

Jeff takes the two bottles, moves to the booth and slides in.

JEFF
(continuing)
Mr. Stephens?

CHARLIE
I ain't looking for no new friend,
so git.
30.

Jeff sets a beer in front of Charlie

CHARLIE
(continuing)
Strike that. Glad ta' meetcha'.
Charlie Q.

Stephens is not falling down drunk, but, on the other hand,
he's never sober. Jeff hands Charlie a business card. In
the dim light, Charlie tries to read it.

CHARLIE
(continuing)
Attorney In Law.

JEFF
At Law. I represent Grace Walden.

CHARLIE
(bursts out laughing)
Grace is a ghost, ain't you heard?
They locked her up, man, threw ‘way
the key. She called a couple years
back. But the line went dead.

JEFF
She's in trouble, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Why? She din't sign no affidavit.
They don't owe her no money.

JEFF
Why'd they lock her up?

CHARLIE
Cause she wouldn't listen to me. I
told her to sign that stupid paper.
Hell, she's the one what saw him.

JEFF
Saw whom?

CHARLIE
Man, you don't know shit.
(he stares)
She saw the guy they say shot
Martin Luther King.

Jeff sits there stunned.

JEFF
I beg your pardon.
31.

CHARLIE
Take the wax outta' yer ears, kid.
They say she saw King's killer.
They showed her a picture. She
told 'em it weren't the man she
saw. Then zap! 0O1' Gracie is gone
faster'n Jack's cat.

JEFF
What did you see?

CHARLIE

Hell, I din't see shit. But I told
hem what they wanted. Signed a
paper and everything.

ct

JEFF
Who told you to sign a paper?

CHARLIE

The FBI. They was nice, at first.
Offered me a reward. One hundred
housand crisp US dollars. After I
signed, the shitheads never paid.

 

ct

JEFF
But you didn't see anything.

Charlie erases this irrelevant observation with his hand in
the air.

CHARLIE
They didn't say nothin' about
paying me for what I saw. They
said they'd pay me for what I
signed!

Jeff studies Charlie Q. Stephens, sure now that whatever else
may have happened, Charlie is telling the truth.

JEFF
Is there anything you know that
could help get Grace out of
Bolivar? There's no money in it.

Charlie winces.

CHARLIE
I could swear that Grace was never
crazy... But I reckon you wouldn't

want me for no witness, would you?
32.

Jeff is moved by the human being, Charlie Stephens, peering
out from the "character" of the notorious loser.

CHARLIE
(continuing)
Have you seen her? How's she
doing?

JEFF
Not real good. When I met her she
seemed awful confused.

CHARLIE
Sounded fine when I talked ta her
on the phone. ‘Course that was

some time ago.

JEFF
What time a day was it?
(Charlie looks confused)
When she called? What time of day
was it?

CHARLIE
Mornin. Had to be 'fore 7. Why?
What you thinkin'?

JEFF
Just wondering what time of day
they hand out the meds...

INT. LAWSON'S CHURCH OFFICE - DAY
Lawson is at his desk, on the phone.

LAWSON
(into receiver)
Look... I need the power back on. I
have an evening choir service.
Can't we get somebody to take a
look at it?

PUSH PAST his shoulder to the WINDOW. A gray TERMITE
INSPECTION TRUCK is parked across the street.

INT. TRUCK - - DAY
Two AGENTS are monitoring the phone tap on Reverend Lawson.
WOMAN'S VOICE
(filtered)

We'll try and get a crew out there
ina little bit.
33.

INT. LAWSON'S STUDY - DAY

He presses the button to disconnect. After he does, he hears
two more CLICKS. He looks at the phone, then notices the truck
outside the window. He flips open his Rolodex, and dials.

LAWSON
Hello, Sister Ione? It's Reverend
Lawson...

INTERCUT - SISTER IONE'S LIVING ROOM

Gospel music PLAYS. There is a picture of a White Jesus on
the wall. Ione holds the phone, elated.

TONE
Oh, Reverend? Must be my lucky day.

LAWSON
Well, Sister Ione, luck ain't
nothing but preparation meeting
opportunity. Now, before Willy
gets the opportunity to sing for
Brother Boxer, we gotta be sure
he's prepared. Is he around?

TONE
(bellowing)
Willeee!!!
INTERCUT - INT. VAN
The men with the headphones wince.
INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

Willie comes to the phone.

WILLY
Yes sir...

LAWSON
Willy, I want you to practice for
me right here, on the phone. Eye
On The Sparrow.

WILLY
Oh, yes sir!

He clears his throat, starts singing badly.
34.

WILLY (CONT'D)
(continuing)
I sing because I'm happy, I sing
because I'm free...

LAWSON
Louder, Willy, louder. Take me
home, son!

WILLIE
Yes sir.

Willy belts out the song louder and way off key.
INT. VAN

Willy's grating singing fills the enclosure as the two Agents
suffer. Tape wheels spin, recording it all.

CUT TO:
INT. BOLIVAR STATE HOSPITAL LOBBY - - DAY
Close on a wall clock. It reads 6:30. PAN DOWN TO Brian

Greene, with an "e". GUARD #3 is trying to guide Greene out
of the hallway, back into his room.

GREENE
I believe it was a Rottweiler --
"en "gn "jy" -- that's a German dog!

It was wandering in the hallway...

GUARD #3
Mr. Greene, get back to your room.

JEFF, in a well-soiled food service uniform, pushes a cart
down the hall. A hair net and dark glasses complete his
disguise. As the attendant leads Greene back to his room,
Greene stops. He stares at Jeff. Then it hits him.

GREENE
Jeffrey Jenkins, Esquire! Jeffrey
with a J not a G. Esquire, not
like a knight, but a barrister...

Jeff tries to contain his panic. The Guard looks at the
grimy food service uniform, then back at Greene.

GUARD #3
Get your ass in your room!

The Guard leads Greene off. Jeff breathes deeply, moves on.
35.

INT. PATIENTS' WARD -- GRACE'S CUBICLE

Jeff slips into Grace's cubicle. Grace looks up and stares.
Jeff removes his glasses, starts talking quickly.

JEFF
Mrs. Walden -- it's me. Your
lawyer. Jeffrey Jenkins?

She looks back at him. Grace is surprised. Jeff removes the
tape recorder from his pants.

JEFF
(continuing)
The firm of Branson, Davis and
Douglas. Don't you remember?

Grace stares. Jeff suddenly remembers. He removes the hair
net. Grace smiles.

GRACE
Mr. Jenkins?... They sure ran you
out of here the other day -- I
remember that.

JEFF
Mrs. Walden, why are you here?
(no response)
We don't have much time.

GRACE
Are you really my lawyer?

JEFF
Yes, Ms. Walden. This is just a
disguise...

GRACE

Are you goin' to get me out of
here? I need your word.

JEFF
I'll do everything in my power...

GRACE
No! No excuses. Last time I told
what happened, it landed me in
here. I need you to promise.

Jeff pauses. This old woman has clearly been through hell.
36.

JEFF
You have my word, Grace. I
promise. I'll get you out

She studies Jeff's eyes. Hesitates, then
GRACE
After the gun shot. I saw the man
who ran down the corridor. And I
wouldn't lie about it.

JEFF
What happened?

Grace looks away; her voice and eyes remember.

GRACE
I was living with Charlie Q.
Stephens back then... It was April

4th of '68.
FLASHBACK:
INT. ROOMING HOUSE -- BLACK AND WHITE
Grace sits reading in her room. The door to her room is open.
INT. ROOMING HOUSE HALLWAY

Charlie Q. Stephens, drunk and disorderly, is pounding on the
door of the bathroom which is shared by the entire floor.

CHARLIE
(shouting)
Hey, did you move in there? There
are other people out here, you
know. Will you get out of that
g'damn bathroom?

There is no answer. Charlie kicks the door, then turns to
walk down the hallway. He passes the room he shares with
Grace, then starts to descend the stairway.

EXT. ROOMING HOUSE -- DAY

Charlie leaves the building and heads for the alley beside
the house, complaining.

CHARLIE
Sonofabitch thinks he owns the
bathroom...

Charlie begins to urinate, still mumbling and complaining.
37.

INT. GRACE'S ROOM

Grace remains in her room, reading her book. As she rocks in
her rocking chair, an EXPLOSION from a high-powered rifle
rattles the room! Grace bolts up. She hears FOOTSTEPS.
Grace turns towards the hallway. Her door is partially open.

GRACE'S POV

A MAN -- short, approximately 50 years old, rushes past
Grace's door. He is carrying something in his right hand.
His body intervenes between the object and Grace.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- THE PRESENT
Start TIGHT ON Grace.

GRACE
Five minutes later, seemed like
there were police everywhere. They
brought in some guy who wanted me
to help put together a picture of
the man I saw...

JEFF
An identikit?

GRACE
Something like that... And after I
finished with that artist, the FBI
came. I told them everything I
knew and they left...

FLASHBACK:
INT. GRACE'S ROOM -- BLACK AND WHITE

GRACE (V.0.)
But they came back that summer
in early June...

TwO FBI AGENTS have photos and documents spread out before
Grace. Charlie Stephens sits in a corner watching and
listening. One agent is PAUL and the other is BOBBY LEE.

BOBBY LEE
. Alright, now, honey, sign right
here.

GRACE
I don't have my glasses.
38.

PAUL
It's an affidavit. It says that
this man --
(flashes photo)
-- James Earl Ray, is the man you
saw on the day of the murder.

GRACE
You already know who he is?

PAUL
They got him over in England. And
when you sign this, they'll ship
him back to us. You'll be famous.
It's for your country.

Charlie's big eyes are looking for an opening. Grace sees
Charlie signaling her.

BOBBY LEE
Then there's the money. Some
people here in Memphis have offered
a reward of $100,000. Wouldn't you
like to have $100,000?

GRACE
That would be very nice.

The FBI Agents share a look.

PAUL
You bet. So just put your John
Hancock right here.

GRACE
(finds her glasses)
Could you show me that picture
again?

Bobby Lee pushes a photo over to her. Grace studies the

picture.

GRACE
(continuing)
You got the wrong man.

PAUL
(impatient)
Let me assure you, Mrs. Walden, we
have the right man.
39.

GRACE
The man I saw come past that door
was older, shorter, and thinner
than this man. Didn't look
anything like him.

BOBBY LEE
Don't you want to help your
country?

GRACE

Yes, sir, I sure do. You find the
right man and I'll sign that
affidavit. Gotta say what I truly
seen.

Bobby Lee knows he's got a problem.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- THE PRESENT

JEFF
You never signed the affidavit?

GRACE
I couldn't. They had the wrong man.

JEFF
You're sure?

GRACE
I wish I wasn't...

FLASHBACK:
INT. GRACE'S ROOM - BLACK AND WHITE - NIGHT

A BLACK SCREEN. Suddenly, a hole gets kicked into the middle
of the shot as TWO MEN, back lit, throw open the door and
rush into the room.

GRACE (V.0)
But I wouldn't lie. So they
came back... middle of the night.
They break into our room.

The two men drag a half awake Grace out of bed.

GRACE
(continuing)
Whatcha doing? Stop it! Leggo' a
me!
40.

One of the men has restraints in his jacket. Grace is bound
and pulled out of the rooming house.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - PRESENT - DAY

GRACE
Next thing I know, I'm in here.
Won't let me talk to anyone on the
outside. I'm the only one. No
visits. Not even by telephone. And
that's over eight years now.

Jeff just stares with a growing concern. He shuts off the
tape recorder.

JEFF
I'm going to get you out of here,
Grace. I promise.

CUT TO:
INT. N.D. OFFICE - - DAY

The Backlit Man is on the phone. Grainy black and white
surveillance photos of Jeff and Lawson are on his desk.

BACKLIT MAN
These guys aren't getting the
message.
(listens)
It's worth a try.

INT. CHURCH - DAY
Lawson is preaching without a mike.

LAWSON
We're having our service today
without electricity, but Jesus
didn't need electricity.

CONGREGATION (0.S.)
Amen.

LAWSON
They can kill the power, but they
can't kill our power, because our
power's from above and we sure pay
that monthly bill right here, don't
we?
41.

CONGREGATION
(chuckling)
Amen.

The door at the side of the rostrum opens and two men in gray
suits walk toward the lectern. The congregation gets quiet
Lawson does not see the men at first, but he is struck by the
quiet congregation. He turns to see the first suit withdraw
a wallet from his coat pocket.

MAN
Good morning, Reverend. We're from
the IRS.

LAWSON

I'm conducting a church service.

MAN
And we're conducting a tax audit.
(hands over an envelope)
Could you please have your '73
through '75 records at our office
tomorrow. By ten A.M. Sorry for
the inconvenience.

They turn and leave as Lawson looks after them.
INT. JUSTINE'S RESTAURANT - - NIGHT

A STRING QUARTET is playing a medley from Show Boat, rising
to "Old Man River." Lucas is at a table reading the Press-
Scimatar. Jeff approaches. He's edgy, slightly disheveled.

JEFF

Sorry I'm late.
(he sits)

Everything's just turned upside down.
First Lawson puts me on the Walden
case, then he tries to pull me off.
I meet Grace. She seems crazy one
day, then clear-as-a- bell the next.
Then I find Grace's companion, guy
named Charlie Q. Stephens...

LUCAS
Charlie Q. Stephens?

JEFF
You know him?

LUCAS
Of him. Scrambled eggs!
A passing WAITER leans in.

WAITER
For dinner, Sir?
LUCAS
(laughing)
No. Just bring us some champagne.
(to Jeff)
What do you want with Charlie?
JEFF
He's a key witness in the Walden
case...
LUCAS
.. Charlie Stephens didn't witness
dogshit!
JEFF

How do you know Charlie?

LUCAS
He was a big deal for fifteen
minutes. Said he saw James Earl Ray
run out of the rooming house after
Dr. King was shot. Hell, he just
wanted the reward money we offered.

The Waiter brings and pours the champagne.

JEFF
"Wwe"?

LUCAS
I was part of a local committee.
Set up a reward fund to solve the
murder.
(gestures Waiter over)
Henri, how's the Sole tonight?

WAITER
Very fresh.

LUCAS
(to Jeff)
For both of us?
(Jeff nods)
And some gumbo to start.

The waiter leaves.

42.
43.

JEFF
Why didn't Charlie ever get his
reward money?

LUCAS
Because he never testified. He
didn't have to! James Earl Ray
pled guilty. Had no choice. They
found the murder weapon with his
prints all over it.

JEFF
And Grace? She's still out at
Bolivar.

LUCAS

That may have been an injustice.
But her incarceration is not
evidence of some conspiracy.

JEFF
Look, dad, I'm not a conspiracy
nut. I'm just a lawyer trying to
win my first case.

LUCAS
You have to consider more than
winning, son. You have to consider
what's best for your client. Can
she take care of herself?

JEFF
I'm not sure. But I am sure she
can't stay out there at Bolivar.

LUCAS
What if you had her moved to a half-
way house.

JEFF
What?

LUCAS
Forget the trial, no trial. Justa
simple motion for relief.

JEFF
She was illegally incarcerated. She
deserves her day in court.
44,

LUCAS
Look, if you mention the King
assassination, they'll have her
certified... and the only way
she'll leave that place is in an
urn. Listen to me: get your motion
technically perfect, keep it de
minimus. She'll go to a nice
place, be well cared for.

The waiter approaches, sets down two bowls of soup.

WAITER
Enjoy your soup.

Jeff is pensive. Lucas looks at him, then picks up his spoon
and samples the gumbo. It's terrific.

INT. BRANSON LAW LIBRARY -- TWO DAYS LATER

Large and spacious, there is an Oriental rug over hardwood
floors and a massive conference table. Law books surround the
walls. Jeff is looking something up. Clay Morgan enters.

MORGAN
Hey, Jeff. What makes no money,
pisses off partners and sinks
faster than lead shot?

JEFF
Clay, I don't need this right now.

MORGAN
BIZZZ! Time's up. It's your Grace
Walden case.

The door to the library opens and Branson enters. He notices
Jeff and Morgan.

BRANSON
Clay could you excuse us for a
moment?

Clay leaves, closing the door behind him. Branson looks at
Jeff, then spins his case file around and looks at it.

BRANSON
(continuing)
Habeas corpus application for
release? You're determined to make
an opera of this, aren't you?
45.

JEFF
No, sir. Just defending my client.

BRANSON
Ten hours, that was the deal.
You're way over.

JEFF
Well, sir it's gotten kinda
complicated. I believe if you...

Jeff stops because Branson is glaring at him. Branson sighs.

BRANSON
Okay, here's how it will be
handled. You will appear before
Judge Horace Jackson. You will
file a motion for confinement to a
halfway house. There will be no
further suits, actions or claims.
Is that clear?

JEFF
Very clear, sir.

Branson turns and leaves.
INT. MEMPHIS COURTROOM - - DAY

Jeff and Katy enter the courtroom. Katy takes a seat in the
first row of the spectator section, directly behind the
defense table.

LAWSON (0.S.)
Jeff.

Jeff turns to see Lawson get up from the opposite side of the
courtroom.

LAWSON
(continuing)
This is a mistake. Get a
postponement, do what ever...

BAILIFF
All rise! Court is in session. The
Honorable Judge Horace Jackson
presiding.

Jackson enters, takes his seat. Jeff moves to his appointed
spot at the defense table. A side door opens. Grace appears
in the doorway, escorted by a MATRON and a GUARD.
46.

She is dressed in a horrible print smock. Her hair is a mess
and she isn't wearing her teeth.

JEFF
(turns to Katy)
Where's her new dress?

KATY
I don't know. I delivered it
myself.

Grace is led to the defense table.

JEFF
Grace? Are you alright. Where's
the dress we bought you?

Grace stares off in the distance, drugged.

JEFF
(continuing; to the
Matron)
Come on, lady, what'd you give her?
Where's her new dress?!

This tense face-off is interrupted by the POUNDING of the
Judge's gavel. Jackson looks disapprovingly at Grace.

JUDGE JACKSON
(sotto voce)
Good God...
(leans back)
Counsel approach the bench. You
join us, too, Mr. Cooper.

C. JAMES COOPER, Assistant Attorney General, and Jeff walk up
to the bench. Jeff is white with rage. Lawson looks on with
consternation.

JUDGE
(to Jeff)
Your client don't look too alert to
me, counselor.

JEFF
(nervous)
Perhaps, Your Honor, that's because
she's been given sedatives.

COOPER
The State is outraged, your Honor!

JUDGE
That's a serious accusation, young man.
47.

JEFF
I'm sorry, your Honor. I am simply
asking for a ruling on my
application for habeas corpus.

JUDGE
Well, that's flat denied. It's
obvious to anyone with eyes that
Ms. Walden is in no condition to
care for herself. I order that she
be moved to a halfway house.

Jeff, Grace, Lawson all react. In the back of the courtroom
sits a stoic, elderly man, MR. PHILLIPS.

JUDGE

(continuing; indicating)
Mr. Phillips, I hereby name you
guardian ad-litem to protect the
interests of Ms. Walden. If you
believe that interviews and
involvement in controversial
matters would be harmful to her, I
am confident you will act
appropriately.

JEFF
But your Honor...

The Judge bangs his gavel.

JUDGE
Shut up, Mr. Jenkins, and you hear
what I say. You are to have no
further contact with Miz Walden.
That means by phone or by mail or
by smoke signals. You got me on
that?

JEFF
She's never had a hearing or a
psychiatric evaluation. She's been
denied...

JUDGE
Don't mess with me Mr. Jenkins
unless you intend to embark on a
new career.

The Judge precipitously swivels in his chair and heads for
his chambers. Jeff is stunned, turns to see Lawson. Their
eyes connect. PUSH IN on Lawson.
48.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP

A black and white image of the 1968 Sanitation Workers'
March. At the head of the march, walking arm-in-arm, is a
row of clergy. At the center of the group is Martin Luther
King. Next to him is Jim Lawson.

INT. CHURCH STUDY - DAY
Lawson sits at his desk, staring at the photo in front of
him. MOVE IN TIGHT Lawson. SOUNDS of breaking glass begin
to rise. SHOUTING.

FLASHBACK:
EXT. MEMPHIS STREET - DAY - MARCH 30, 1968
Black and white newsreel footage of the March. Then the
images of rioting. Of the police. Mayhem. Then the row of
Clergy marching arm-in-arm. MOVE-IN ON King and Lawson.
Flash! The screen goes white.

CUT BACK TO:
BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH OF LAWSON AND KING IN THE MARCH
INT. CHURCH STUDY - PRESENT
Pull back from the photograph to reveal that it rests on the
desk. Lawson sits quietly, anguished by the memory. The
room is lit only by candles.

DOROTHY (V.0.)
Were you back with Martin, again?

Lawson turns to see his wife has entered the study.

LAWSON
No... no... just thinking.

DOROTHY
I'm going home. Gotta get the tax
records together. Clarence said
the power company still hasn't
showed up. He's checking the cable
himself.

LAWSON
Thanks.

He seems down and she knows her man.
49.

DOROTHY
It wasn't your fault, baby.

LAWSON
Yeah, I know... I know.

DOROTHY
We'll get through it. We always
have before.

She kisses him on the top of the head and leaves. Lawson
sits back and looks at the picture of Martin.

LAWSON
(sotto voce)
Am I doing right here, Martin? I
feel like I'm messing up...
(a beat)
Gimme a sign, Brother.

And right then, the lights come back on.

CLARENCE'S VOICE
I got 'em Reverend. Looks like the
line was cut.

A loud POP!!
INT. LUCAS JENKINS'S HOME - - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP on a champagne bottle. The cork flies, foam spills.
PULL-BACK to reveal Lucas Jenkins pouring the champagne into
two glasses. Jeff stands across from his father. Lucas
passes him a glass. He then raises his glass to propose a
toast. Jeff reluctantly follows suit.

LUCAS
Ubi Ius Ibi Remedium. Where law
prevails, there is a remedy. To you
Jeff, to your first legal victory.

JEFF
Victory? I was all but run outta
court.

LUCAS

Nonsense. You have to temper your
idealism with practicality. The
Memphis Lawyer called me for a quote.
They're doing an article about you.
You've come out of this just fine.
50.

JEFF
You think? I can't see my client
That halfway house could be just
another locked room. I'll never
know, because I've been prohibited
from contacting her.

LUCAS
Grace will be just fine.

JEFF
You don't know that! You went to
Lawson to have me pulled off the
case. Didn't you?! Then you went
to Branson.
(no response)

That was your idea, the halfway
house? You went behind my back.

LUCAS
I protected your back! I'm trying
to operate in your best interest.

JEFF
I have a client. She happens to be
my first client and my only client.
She's not crazy. She doesn't need
a halfway house. She needs her
freedom.

LUCAS
And you need to stop being so damn
naive! Lawson just wanted a white
face to walk into court. He knew
about the strings attached to Grace
Walden, about Charlie Stephens and
James Earl Ray and the whole
cesspool of lunatic conspiracy
theories. He set you up. And
he'll drag you down with him.

Jeff turns, leaving his father alone. Prelap SOUND of a

INT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lawson opens the front door and finds Jeff standing on his
front porch.

JEFF
We need to talk.

He pushes his way into the house. Lawson follows.
51.

INT. DEN - NIGHT
They enter. Lawson closes the door.

JEFF
This isn't about Grace Walden at
all, is it?! Grace is your star
witness! You're trying to use her
to reopen the King case.

LAWSON
To begin with, lower your voice. I
have children sleeping.

Jeff takes a deep breath, nods.

LAWSON
(continuing)
Secondly, wWimmresked you to go up to
Bolivar? I just asked you to file
a writ.

JEFF
(still pissed)
She was my client. I can't file
papers on her behalf without
talking to her first.

LAWSON
Sure you can. She was denied due
process. Write a writ, plain and
simple. File it. Instead, because
you went up there, you got them all
riled up. Now she's locked away in
some halfway house and we'll never
get her testimony.

JEFF
You never gave a damn about her
For you this was just about the
King assassination!

LAWSON
You're wrong, Jeff.

JEFF
Yeah? Why now? It's been eight
years. Case closed.

LAWSON
Wrong! The climate has changed.
Hoover's dead. We're out of Viet
Nam.
52.
LAWSON(CONT'D)
Now the public's beginning to ask
questions. People are organizing.
There's a petition drive -
demanding that the Congress set up
a committee to investigate. The
time is right. We have to do it
now.

JEFF
We? You presume that "we" includes
the young white attorney who was dumb
enough to run a key part of your case
by a genteel white judge? Right?

LAWSON
A Black attorney would be viewed
differently. It would look more
like politics than law.

JEFF
It is politics. It's nothing but
politics.
(a beat.)
My father is right. I'm one naive
bastard.
LAWSON

There's much more at stake here
than your feelings. Martin was
murdered. He was assassinated and
the wrong man is in jail for it.

JEFF
You wanted me to return the tape.
Here it is!

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out an audio tape.

JEFF
(continuing)
The first one was gibberish. This
one tells it all. Take it, I won't
need it anymore.

He hands Lawson the tape, gets up and exits.

INT. RACK AND CUE BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

Start on a triangle of balls. A cue ball smacks into the
pack. Jeff is shooting a solitary game of Eight Ball. He's

a lone white face in the run down joint. On the TV screen
over the bar, the local TV station is on.
53.

TV ANNOUNCER
AS we approach the eighth
anniversary of Dr. King's
assasSination, our reporter, Terri
Chambers, has assembled a tribute
to this great American.

On the TV, a montage special of King.

HAROLD (0.S.)
Well, well well...

Jeff turns to see Harold. He is sharply dressed. Harold is
barely recognizable as the Jenkins' humble houseman. He
holds a cue case.

HAROLD
(continuing)
What's they MORE) Ya gotta bring
some ass to whup some ass! Must be
ass-whupping time.

JEFF
(down)
Ain't been that time for a while
Poppa H.

HAROLD

(putting cue together)
Well, well, Mister Jeff, you not
here for a whuppin'?

(no response)
You here about that pretty girl?

(no response)
Must be serious. We better rack
"em up.

Collecting the balls in the triangle. The TV keeps rolling
the clips. The immediate image shows the chaos right after
King's killing.

JEFF
You go to Lawson's church, right?

HAROLD
Deacon's Board. Eleven years now.

JEFF
What's with that guy?

HAROLD
The Reverend?
(Jeff nods)
54.
HAROLD (CONT'D)
Lawson's a heavyweight. Studied at
that Ghandi School in India. Taught
nonviolence to all them students that
integrated in Selma, Montgomery...

JEFF
But what about all the conspiracy
stuff? I mean, seems a little, I
don't know...

HAROLD

or you don't want to know?

(Jeff is caught like a

deer in headlights)
Scary, ain't it? This here's the
land of the free... the home of the
brave, huh? One nation, with liberty
and justice for all! Wake up, boy!

Jeff has been so accustomed to seeing Harold as the
deferential houseman, that the sudden revelation of Harold's
political cynicism is disorienting.

HAROLD
(continuing; lines up his
break)
You busy tomorrow, ‘round 8PM?

Jeff nods. Harold breaks. The balls scatter. On the TV-a
powerful image of King.

KING
(footage)

The goal of life is not to seek

pleasure or pain. The goal of life

is to do God's work, come what may...
Jeff looks intently at the screen. King alive, vital.

SHOCK CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP -- MARTIN LUTHER KING, DEAD

A VOICE
Next!

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - - NIGHT

A flash of light reveals a slide-projector. ANOTHER SLIDE
pops onto the large screen: a closer shot of King, dead.

A large sign tells us we are at MEMPHIS STATE UNIVERSITY.
Only a handful of STUDENTS, mostly black, are in attendance.
From a light booth, an AIDE punches up slides onto a screen.
55.

The spill of light reveals DICK GREGORY, as he concludes his
lecture.

GREGORY
.. Next!

SLIDE #2: KING'S AIDES POINTING FROM THE BALCONY

GREGORY
(continuing)
Who did it? I don't know. But I
do know that before you can
discover the who, you have to
understand the why.

SLIDE #3: THE WEARY DEFIANT FACES OF THE WORKERS IN CONTRAST
TO THE HELMETED POLICE.

Jeff and Harold standmogrehe back of the auditorium,
listening.

GREGORY
(continuing)
Dr. King came to Memphis to march
with the striking workers. He came
because Reverend James Lawson
begged him to come.

SLIDE 4: MLK AND JIM LAWSON MARCHING ARM-IN-ARM
Jeff is taken by surprise.
SLIDE 5: A WORKER WEARS A PLACARD THAT SAYS "I AM A MAN"

GREGORY
(continuing)
"I am aman!" Martin came to
Memphis so that sanitation workers
could have the simple right to use
the city's toilets instead of a tin
can in the cab of their truck!

STUDENT
Mr. Gregory, are you saying Dr.
King was killed by someone opposed
to the strike?

GREGORY
No. Memphis was the scene of the
crime, but it wasn't the cause. The
cause lay in Washington. Dr. King
had organized a Poor People's
March.
56.
GREGORY (CONT'D)

People, maybe millions, were going
to set up a tent city right in the
heart of the Capitol.

(wipes his brow)
Martin intended to stay in DC until
the economic order of this country
was changed. And that terrified
the authorities. It was sedition.
It was insurrection!

The images on the screen continue to change, giving visual
dimension to Gregory's narrative.

GREGORY

(continuing)
Exactly one month before the
assasSination, J. Edgar Hoover
wired every FBI office: "Prevent
the rise of a black Messiah".
Washington, D.C. was Jerusalem to
Martin Luther King - and to John
Edgar Hoover.

The lights go up. The lean, intense Gregory "preaches" and
teaches to the hushed audience.

GREGORY
(continuing)

Martin King was assassinated
because he was a dreamer, a drum
major, for all people's Human
Rights! And those responsible for
his death didn't just kill the
dreamer - they wanted to kill the
dream! We have to press for the
truth. We have to relight the
flame! Sign the petition. We can
force the Congress to investigate
Dr. King's murder.

A bell RINGS. Lecture is over. Harold looks at Jeff, then
turns and walks away. Jeff stands shell-shocked, inert.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The crowd is dispersing after the lecture. Gregory walks out
carrying his slides and notes. Jeff is waiting.

JEFF
Mr. Gregory...?

GREGORY
I'm sorry. I'm running late.
57.

JEFF
I'm Grace Walden's attorney.

Gregory stops, looks back at Jeff.

GREGORY
You know where I can reach her? We
need her testimony.

JEFF
What makes you so sure that Ray
didn't do it. They found the gun
with his prints on it.

GREGORY
That they did. That fact alone
points to his innocence.

Jeff appears confused. Pre-lap SOUNDS of running feet.
FLASHBACK:
EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - APRIL 4, 1968 - 6:02 PM

Start on running feet. A shadowy figure emerges from the side
entrance of the rooming house. In his right hand, he carries
a rifle wrapped in a blanket. The figure turns left onto Main
Street, drops the package in plain view and runs on.

GREGORY (V.0.)
Assume Ray did carefully plot the
killing, why in hell would he drop
the gun with his fingerprints on it
right outside the rooming house?

CUT BACK TO:
INT. CORRIDOR - PRESENT

GREGORY

That rifle was such an obvious
plant, I'm surprised nobody watered
it.

(growing impatient)
Look, the committee is about to
hire a Special Counsel. Edward
Ennis. He was Solicitor General
under FDR. He'll need to interview
Grace.
58.

JEFF
My client has been involuntarily
committed to an institution. My
only concern is her freedom...

GREGORY
You can't really be that naive. Grace
Walden is a political prisoner.
You'll never get her justice until
you deal with the larger issue.
She's the key to this whole case. I
need to talk to her!

JEFF
Not going to happen.

Jeff turns and walks away.
INT. LAWSON HOUSE - E@RORE YORNING

We hear a persistent BANGING on the door. Jim Lawson moves
through the shot, belting a robe, he is half-asleep as he
leans down and looks through the peep hole.

HIS POV - FISH EYE - JEFF JENKINS

Standing on his porch in the rain. His hair and clothes
dripping wet.

RESUME LAWSON
He opens the door, reveals Jeff.

JEFF
I have one question...

LAWSON
Come out of the rain, boy.

Jeff moves into the house and begins puddling on the floor of
the entry hall. Lawson tosses him a towel.

JEFF
If Dick Gregory and the others can
get Congress to open up an
investigation and if Grace were to
testify, could they protect her...
keep her from being locked up in
another nut house?

LAWSON
It's the Congress of The United
States of America.
59.
LAWSON(CONT'D)
They can do anything they want.
(beat)
We've already contacted a very
eminent jurist to be Counsel...

JEFF
(interrupting)
I know. Edward Ennis.
(Lawson is surprised)
You don't need eminent! You need a
killer, a pit bull.

LAWSON
What are you saying?

JEFF
Richard Sprague is in town for the
Bar Association Convention...
(a beat)
He took on Tony Boyle and the whole
corrupt Mine Workers Union and beat
them to a pulp.

(beat)
You hire Sprague, and I'm with you
on this.
LAWSON
(pauses)

Because of what happened to Martin,
or what happened to Grace?

JEFF
I promised my client her freedom...
so far, I haven't kept my word.

Lawson chooses his words carefully.

LAWSON
I'll have to make some calls, but
if Sprague is available and
willing, we'll go with him.

Jeff exhales. That settles it. He turns to go.

LAWSON
(continuing)
What are you gonna do?

JEFF
I'm gonna go rescue my client from
that halfway house.

LAWSON
You're going to kidnap her?
60.

JEFF
I'm going to liberate her.

LAWSON
Son, slow down here, for a minute.
You been drinking haven't you?
You're going to defy a court order?
You could go to jail.

JEFF
Yeah, I thought about that... and
that's a drag.

Lawson hesitates.

LAWSON
Hold on, a minute, I'm coming with
you.

JEFF

You gonna try to talk me out of it?
LAWSON
Somebody needs to say prayers over
this damn fool idea.
Lawson heads off to change. MOVE IN ON Jeff, still wet.
INT. HALFWAY HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE ON Grace, talking on the telephone.

GRACE
Of course I recognize your voice.
(beat)
I don't think I can do that.
(beat)

Red. All right. Goodbye.
WIDEN TO REVEAL the MATRON in the room, listening.

GRACE
(continuing; to Matron)
That was my uncle. He wants me to
knit him a sweater. He likes red.

MATRON
I took the call downstairs. Sounded
like a young man to me...
61.

EXT. STREET - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Jeff hangs up a pay phone and walks back, across the street
Lawson is sitting in his W, parked behind a new red Chevy
rental car. The rain has stopped.

JEFF
She'll be out front in fifteen
minutes. Maybe a prayer about now
would help.

Lawson puts the WW in gear and pulls out. Jeff walks to the
rental car, gets in and hangs a U, going in the opposite
direction.

EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE - DAY
The red rental car pulls up in front of the Halfway House.
ON GRACE

She is seated on the top step, knitting. A large paper
shopping bag is beside her. As soon as she sees the red car,
Grace grabs the bag, darts down the steps and jumps into the
car. It screams away. The Matron runs after

THE MATRON

takes a pen and a pad from her pocket and tries to jot down
the license plate number of the vehicle but Jeff has removed
the plate. (He's learning the tricks).

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

The red car makes a right turn at the next corner, then a
left. It pulls up alongside Lawson's parked car. Jeff and
Grace exit the red car and walk forward to the W.

Lawson sits in the driver's seat. Next to him is a burly
BLACK MAN. The Black Man exits the W and walks toward Jeff.
They exchange a word. The Black Man then moves to the red
car, gets behind the wheel and drives away.

Jeff and Grace enter the W and Lawson drives away.
INT. CAR - DAY
JEFF
Grace, this is Reverend Lawson.

He's the one who asked me to be
your attorney.
62.

GRACE
God bless you, Reverend.

LAWSON

Thank you, Grace.
(a beat)

We've arranged a place for you to
stay. We can only use it for a
coupla' days, but we'll find a more
permanent place. The main thing
is, you'll be protected.

Grace appears relieved. They pull out
EXT. A SMALL HOUSE ON CENTRAL AVE. - DAY

The W pulls up. The SOUND of another car approaching gets
Jeff's attention. TWO BLACK MEN drive up and park. They get
out and approach Jeff. Grace looks at the men with concern.

LAWSON
These men were part of the
Sanitation Workers' Strike. Dr
King came to Memphis to help them.
They're going to take turns keeping
an eye on the house.

Grace nods courteously to the two men.
JEFF

We're going to need you to tell
your story.

GRACE
I won't say I saw something I
didn't.

JEFF

That's what we're counting on.
Jeff hugs Grace.
INT. N.D. OFFICE - - DAY

The Backlit Man is seated at his desk. The door opens and an
AGENT enters, stands with his back to the CAMERA.

AGENT
The Matron confirmed it. Grace
Walden's gone.
63.

BACKLIT MAN
Young Mr. Jenkins had a promising
career. You have the file?

INT. BRANSON'S OFFICE - - DAY

CLOSE on a polished conference table. The Memphis Lawyer
hits the shiny surface and slides across the table. We
FOLLOW IT and PAN UP to Katy, who is standing in the office,
looking at an angry William Branson.

BRANSON
You said you'd get us some press
Miss Bolton, but this sure as hell,
isn't what I had in mind.

She picks it up.
(MORE)
BRANSON
(continuing)
Don't waste your time. It's not a
pleasant read.

They stand there for a long moment, trading looks.

BRANSON

(continuing)
Frankly, I'm confused. Your people
are always griping about lack of
opportunity. And here you are, at
a prestigious firm, where you have
a chance to advance your race.
And, what do you do with it?

(he points at article)
You jeopardize this firm's
reputation and your own reputation
for what? A crazy old lady.

(a beat)
Jeff Jenkins is listening to you
and Lawson and all the rest of your
people involved in this...

KATY
(interrupting)
Sir...

BRANSON
Let me finish. If Jeff is involved
in the kidnapping of this woman, he
will be disbarred and, likely
jailed.
(a beat)
64.
BRANSON(CONT'D)

I expect you to talk sense into
that boy or don't bother to come
back here tomorrow morning.

(a beat)
We've done our part. Now, dammit,
you do yours.

Katy stands, her expression unflinching.

CUT TO:
EXT. MEMPHIS HOTEL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
Jeff and Lawson approach the entrance.

JEFF
(low)
Sprague may be the best criminal
prosecutor in the country. He's
only in town for a few days...

LAWSON
You don't have to sell me, son.
Sell him.

INT. SPRAGUE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON RICHARD SPRAGUE. 40's, well-tailored. Tough as
nails.

SPRAGUE
It's kinda off my beat...

LAWSON
My young friend here, tells me
you're ... the best criminal
prosecutor in the country.

Jeff gives Lawson a look

SPRAGUE
(a smile)
I see...
(a beat)
Who knows about this meeting,
tonight?

LAWSON
Besides us, just Congressman
Fauntroy. He's in charge of the
House Committee.
65.

EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

A dark-colored, windowless VAN is parked at the curb. A

MIDDLE AGED WHITE MAN wearing a suit approaches the van. He
carries three cups of coffee. He taps on the rear door. It
opens. He steps inside. The door slides shut, WIPING FRAME.

INT. SPRAGUE'S HOTEL SUITE - MATCHING WIPE

As Jeff crosses frame. REVEAL Sprague, now with his tie off,
holding the folder.

SPRAGUE
You realize that everyone who tries
to prove a political conspiracy
ends up being labeled a crackpot -
or worse.

LAWSON
I've lived with that a while.

JEFF
Would you at least meet with Grace?
I can have her here in ten minutes.
She's been waiting to tell her
story for eight years.

SPRAGUE
Let me get back to you. No need to
rush into this. There's plenty of
time.

Lawson reaches into his pocket and pulls out an envelope and
hands it to Sprague.

LAWSON
This arrived at my church
yesterday.
Sprague opens the envelope, withdraws a note. A small
cylindrical object drops onto the coffee table. It is a .38
caliber bullet. The note is in block letters and reads:
"THE NEXT ONE IS FOR YOU NIGGER"
RESUME ALL
Jeff looks at Lawson. Sprague is clearly troubled.
SPRAGUE

So you're saying there's not that
much time after all....
66.

LAWSON
I'd sort of like to be around to
see how it comes out.

Sprague heaves a sigh.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Neon signs flash from outside. Jeff's shirt sleeves are
rolled up. He is pacing in the small living room of the
suite. Lawson is seated, weary of Jeff's anxiety. LOW TONES
murmur from the adjoining bedroom.

LAWSON
Will you just sit down.

Lawson reaches into a nightstand, withdraws a Gideon Bible.

LAWSON
(continuing)
Here. Read. It'll calm you down.

JEFF
(takes the book)
The Bible?

LAWSON
Try Genesis. Chapter 37.

JEFF
(finds the spot)
"And when they saw him afar off..."
You've got to be kidding.

LAWSON
Read.

Jeff sits, and, what the hell, he reads. After a moment, the
door opens, REVEALING Grace for a minute. Then Sprague comes
into the living room and closes the door, shutting Grace from
view.

SPRAGUE
Lemme ask you a question... Does
she always take her teeth out when
she's talking to strangers?

JEFF
Shit.
67.

SPRAGUE
She's an endearing old lady but
she's fragile.

LAWSON
She's been isolated for eight
years...

SPRAGUE

I can't go to the Congress with
theories. I gotta have witnesses.
Witnesses who can stand up to the
most intense cross examination.

JEFF
Tell us who you need, and we'll try
to get them for you.

SPRAGUE
That's your job. You find the
witnesses that make your case and
bring them to me.

LAWSON
Can we tell Fauntroy you're our
attorney?

SPRAGUE
Not yet. Right now let's say, I'm
willing to be convinced.

EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

Grace is being put into the car and driven off by the
Sanitation Workers who are guarding her. TEN other PEOPLE
and a DOORMAN are milling in front of the Hotel.

Jeff and Lawson stand in the entry watching in silence as the
windowless van pulls out to follow Grace.

ANGLE - JEFF

He sees the van and runs out into the street, blocking its
way. It slams on the brakes. (They won't hit him in front of
ten witnesses). The car with Grace turns the corner and is
gone. The window of the van rolls down. A MAN leans out
angrily.

MAN
Get outta' the way asshole!!
68.

Enough time has passed so Jeff walks back and rejoins Lawson.
The van goes up the street, but they have lost the chance to
follow.

JEFF
I gotta go.

LAWSON
Where you going? We need to find
witnesses.

JEFF
No, you need to find witnesses. I
need to find a more permanent place
for Grace to stay.

Jeff starts to walk off into the night

LAWSON

Hey!... I wanna to hire you.
(Jeff turns)

I want you to be my Counsel.

JEFF
I thought I destroyed your case.
Why would you want to hire a screw
up like me?

LAWSON
(smiles)
I admire your dedication to your
clients. I'm offering you a job.
Start your meter.

JEFF
What about Grace? As part of my
fee, can you arrange a place for
Grace to live?

LAWSON
Well, I suppose...

JEFF
...With meals included.

There is a beat. Finally Lawson smiles. Then, he and Jeff
shake hands.
69.

INT. CHURCH BASEMENT- - DAY

The Choir can be heard rehearsing Gospel music upstairs.
Lawson is going through old newspaper clippings on the
assassination. Brother Clarence escorts Katy in and motions
to Lawson.

KATY
Excuse me. I'm looking for Jeff.

Lawson turns.

LAWSON
Katy. Jeff isn't here.

KATY
Where is he? With Grace?

LAWSON
At the coroner's office. You don't
approve of Jeffrey's involvement in
all this, do you?

KATY
Kidnapping is a serious crime.

LAWSON
Unfortunately, sometimes power
concedes nothing without demand.

KATY
You're preaching to the wrong
sister, Reverend. I lost my father
to talk like that.

She moves deeper into the room.

KATY

(continuing)
Praying has kept my family on their
knees for a long time.

(a beat)
Up until a couple of hours ago, I
had the opportunity to maybe, one
day, effect change from within the
system. You can run around, trying
to beat the doors down from the
outside, and all you do is make a
lot of noise. Insiders can open
those doors.
70.

LAWSON
True. But, "What does it profit a
man, if he gains the whole world
and loses his soul"... Mark Eight,
Chapter Thirteen.

KATY
"A man can't ride your back if
you're standing up straight"
...Martin Luther King, April 15,
1967.

Jeff comes down the stairs, two at a time.

JEFF
Hey, I found something...
(sees Katy)
Katy, good you're here. Look at
this. The slug that the Coroner
removed from the body was in one
piece.

Holds up a picture of the autopsy photo.

JEFF
(continuing)
The Coroner confirms it. But the
slug that the FBI Lab used for a
ballistic's test was in three pieces.
That means there's a massive break in
the chain of evidence.

KATY
Don't jump to conclusions.

JEFF
Who's jumping?! The FBI tried to
match the rifle that was found in
front of the rooming house to the
death slug. There was no match.
Katy, they can't prove that the gun
with Ray's fingerprints on it is the
murder weapon!

He looks at Katy, then Lawson. They're not with him.

JEFF
(continuing)
This is big. You two seem
underwhelmed. Did I miss
something?
71.

EXT. CHURCH - - NIGHT
Jeff and Katy are exiting the Church, walking to her car.

KATY
: I'm not running. I'm just not
going to be a part of a kidnapping.

JEFF
Look, even if none of this bullshit
is true, she's a poor woman who's
been institutionalized without due
process.

KATY
It's easy for you to play
semantics. You're a nice liberal
white boy with no damn idea of what
it's like out there.

JEFF
What about Grace Walden? what's it
like for her?

KATY

Don't tell me about Grace. I've
got a family full of Grace waldens
and they scrubbed floors to send me
to college. I'm the first one out.
Understand?. The farthest you're
gonna fall, is your daddy's country
club.

(a beat)
I'm sorry, Jeff, I can't afford to
be a part of this.

She moves away from him and gets in her car and drives off,
leaving him standing there.

EXT. MEMPHIS COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

Lucas is seated at the outdoor bar, overlooking the luscious
fairways. He's having a lemonade after finishing his morning
golf. Bill Branson sits down beside him.

BRANSON
We just lost the State Employees
Pension Fund and the Southern
Utilities accounts.

He drops a copy of The Memphis Lawyer on the table.
72.

BRANSON (CONT'D)
(continuing)
And it's only Tuesday.

LUCAS
(shaken)
Jesus... I'll talk to him.

BRANSON
It's too late for that. This could
take us all down.

He gets up and exits, passing a WAITER who comes up to the
table.

WAITER
Phone call for you, Mr. Jenkins.

LUCAS
Who is it.

WAITER
Your son.

There is a long, reflective moment.

LUCAS
Tell him I already left.

WAITER
He said it's urgent.

LUCAS
I'm not here.

The Waiter hesitates, then leaves. MOVE IN on Lucas.
INT. DARK CLOSET

A BLACK HAND in a dark closet thrusts through objects to
grasp a long map carton.

INT. ED REDDITT'S DEN - - DAY

VOICE
I was with Memphis PD for 20 years.
I was in charge of security for Dr.
King every time he came to Memphis.

The speaker is ED REDDITT (40s), a Memphis Police Detective:
black; handsome; very intense. Reverend Lawson and Jeff sit.
Jeff has his tape recorder running as Redditt unrolls a LARGE
MAP from the carton and spreads it on his desk.
73.

Lawson and Jeff rise to stand over it. (See Map in Appendix)
Redditt picks up a handful of white pieces from a CHESS SET
and positions them on the map.

REDDITT
This was my assignment. Here's the
Lorraine Motel. Walden and
Stephens were in the rooming house,
here. According to the FBI, the
gunman was over here.

He picks up the black chess king and places it on the
diagram.

REDDITT
(continuing)
And King was here. Up until that
evening, FBI agents were right
here.

He picks up a handful of pieces and places more white pawns
around the perimeter. Only the white queen remains in his
hand. He looks at it, as do Jeff and Lawson.

JEFF
What's with the white queen?

REDDITT
No. Hoover wasn't there.

Lawson gives a huge chuckle, breaking the tension for a
moment. As Redditt resumes, moving pieces, Jeff and Lawson
crowd in closer.

REDDITT
(continuing)

My normal security detail consisted
of ten men. But they cut me back
to two. ‘bout an hour before the
killin', the Chief sent for me. It
was like a meeting of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff...

FLASHBACK:
INT. MEMPHIS POLICE DEPARTMENT, APRIL 4, 1968, 4:30 P.M.

A large conference room filled with men seated at a table:
some wearing high-ranking police brass and uniforms, others,
in plainclothes, stand off to the side. Director of Fire and
Police FRANK HOLLOMAN presides over the meeting. Ed Redditt
has just been brought in by LIEUTENANT ARKIN.
74.

HOLLOMAN
Ed, these gentleman are from the
FBI. They have information that a
group in Mississippi has a contract
out to kill you. So, you go on
home now and stay there.

REDDITT
Chief, I can't leave Officer
Richmond alone.

HOLLOMAN
That's an order, and there's
nothing to discuss.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. REDDITT HOME -- THE PRESENT

REDDITT
Two Memphis police officers took me
home, and remained with me in the
house.

LAWSON
You were under "house arrest"?

JEFF
Mr. Redditt -- what ever happened
to this contract on your life?

REDDITT
After the assassination, no one
ever said another word about it.

LAWSON
And would you be willing to testify
to that? In front of Congress?

REDDITT
Man, I've carried this with me for
too long... Yeah. I'd testify.

Jeff picks up several white pawns. He points to the area of
the diagram that shows the fire station.

JEFF
Wouldn't the firemen have seen
something?

Jeff puts down the white pawns at the fire station. Redditt
smiles, picks up two black knights and places them, also, at
the fire station.
75.

REDDITT
Especially the black firemen. If
they'd been there.
(to Lawson)
Remember Floyd Newsum?

LAWSON
Yeah. He helped organize the sit-
in for the sanitation workers.

REDDITT
Hey, I'm not the only one who's fed-
up with all the lies. Talk to Floyd.

EXT. LEVEE - DAY

The Mississippi River. A stocky black man, FLOYD NEWSUM, is
tossing stones into the tolling river. Lawson and Jeff stand
behind him.

NEWSUM
I should've been there! I would've
seen the killer!

JEFF
Why weren't you at the firehouse?

NEWSUM
Because my supervisor called me at
10:30 at night -- to tell me that I
was transferred. Me and Norvil
Wallace. We were the only two
black firemen at Station 2.

LAWSON
Maybe they needed you somewhere
else...

NEWSUM

No, Reverend: I was sent toa
station that was over staffed.
Understand? So was Norvil. We had
no assignment. But at Number Two,
they were so short-handed that the
equipment was "inoperable for lack
of personnel."

Jeff and Lawson exchange a look
JEFF

What men had the power to move Fire
and Police Officers around like that?
76.

NEWSUM
Not men. Man.

LAWSON
Frank Holloman.

JEFF
who?

LAWSON

In the history of Memphis, for a
brief period of time, there was one
man who was the Director of both
Fire and Police.

JEFF
Was Holloman working for the FBI?

NEWSUM
Best ask Arthur Murtaugh. He was
with the bureau over twenty years.
He's retired. Might be willing to
talk.
(to Jeff)
You married?

JEFF
No.

NEWSUM
That's good.

INT. LAWSON'S OFFICE - DAY

Jeff and Lawson are working together. The office has been
turned into a war room. Jeff reads from a file on King
while eating one of Sister Ione's delicious pies.

JEFF
I can't believe this stuff. They
let King sit in jail with a broken
arm? That's illegal.

LAWSON
That's real. Once Martin went toa
maximum security prison for a
traffic ticket.

Lawson moves to the bulletin board and looks at it.
LAWSON

(continuing)
What about Charlie Q. Stephens?
77.

JEFF

If Sprague thought Grace was
fragile, he's gonna love Charlie.
Besides, Charlie Q. Stephens didn't
witness dogshit.

(off Lawson's look)
A quote from the honorable Lucas
Jenkins.

LAWSON
Yeah, well, Murtaugh sounds
promising.

Jeff starts on another pie as: Dorothy opens the door and
sticks her head in.

DOROTHY
Sister Ione is out here, baby. She
needs to talk to you.

LAWSON
Oh no... not now.

DOROTHY
I've put her off twice already.

JEFF
(licking his fingers)
Is that the lady with the pies? Get
us another peach cobbler.

INT. CORRIDOR - - DAY
The Reverend emerges from his office.

LAWSON
Sister Ione, what can I do for you?

TONE
(tears in her eyes)
I'm so sorry, Reverend, but I can't
come here anymore.

LAWSON
Willie didn't get his solo? I'll
talk to Brother Boxer.

IONE
No... It ain't safe here.

LAWSON
Not safe?
78.

TONE

My sister went to 16th Street
Baptist back in Birmingham. You
remember?

(a beat)
Some of us been gettin' phone
calls... and then, there're those
men taking pictures...

LAWSON
What men? Whatta you talking
about?

DOROTHY
I tried to tell you about that
earlier, honey. There're two men
out in the parking lot. Taking
pictures of license plates.

He starts down the hall and out of the Church. Dorothy calls
after him.

DOROTHY
(continuing)
Jim!
But... he's gone.
EXT. PARKING LOT - - DAY

There are TWO MEN in gray suits moving around with cameras.
One is taking pictures of car license plates. Several of the
Church faithful are getting into cars and pulling out. Some
are standing around watching, not sure what to do.

LAWSON
Moves directly towards the men, who ignore him.
CHURCH MEMBER
(as Lawson goes by)
Who are they, Reverend?

Lawson doesn't respond. He stops in front of them and
snatches the camera out of the surprised Agent's hand.

AGENT
That's government property.

Lawson strips the film out of the camera, then tosses the
camera back. It hits the man in the chest.
79.

AGENT (CONT'D)
(continuing)
You just made a big mistake.

LAWSON
Unless you have business here, you
are trespassing on private
property. You can get the hell out
of this parking lot.

A couple of the BIG CHURCH MEMBERS take their lead from Lawson
and move in. The two Agents look around at the angry black
faces. The Agents back up, get into their car and pull out
Lawson takes the film and walks past the Church Members.

LAWSON
(continuing)
Choir practice starts in ten
minutes, Brother Boxer is waiting.

He heads back into the church.
INT. LAWSON STUDY

Lawson comes in and slams the door. He's still hot. Jeff
has watched it all from the office window.

JEFF
What part of the infant were you
looking at out there?

Lawson drops the film in the trash.

LAWSON
Sometimes I do it better than
others.

He pauses, then turns and faces Jeff.

LAWSON
(continuing)
Murtaugh lives in upstate New York.
I got problems here. You'll have to
go see him by yourself. You okay
with that?

INT. ARTHUR MURTAUGH'S HOME -- NEXT DAY

ARTHUR MURTAUGH (50s) is a shrewd, experienced veteran. His
hands tremble, his face is mottled, he cannot forget
80.

MURTAUGH
I was assigned to the Field Office
in Atlanta. For ten years I was
part of COINTELPRO.

JEFF
Huh?

MURTAUGH
Surveillance and harassment. And
whatever else Hoover deemed
necessary to derail the Civil
Rights Movement.

Jeff is shaken.

JEFF
Whatever else...?

MURTAUGH
Whatever. Remember the four little
girls who were killed by a bomb in
Birmingham? 1963?

(Jeff nods)

We had clear, conclusive evidence
on the killers. Hoover halted the
investigation. Hid the evidence.
No one questioned his authority.

JEFF
Mr. Murtaugh, did you know Frank
Holloman?

MURTAUGH

Sure. Holloman was the Inspector
in charge of the "S.0.G."

(Jeff looks puzzled)
"The Seat of Government" -- that's
what Mr. Hoover called his office.
In Hoover's mind, even the
President reported to him. Holloman
was Hoover's man.

JEFF
He saw Hoover every day?

MURTAUGH
He did. So did I -- at one point
I saw him. I saw it. I saw the
hate.

FLASHBACK:
81.

INT. J. EDGAR HOOVER'S OFFICE -- MARCH, 1968

The office is dark except for the beam of the film projector.
Murtaugh and several OTHER AGENTS sit in the deep shadows
watching. The agents are arranged around the raised desk and
chair of J. EDGAR HOOVER the man in darkness, who sits as if
locked onto the image on the screen of MARTIN LUTHER KING,
JR.

Hoover, squat and seething, is immobile in the light spill.
His voice is a steady subterranean stream of filth:

HOOVER
Commonist. Pervert. Traitor...

ON THE SCREEN (STOCK): KING #1

DR. KING
"A few years ago, it seemed as if
there was a real promise of hope
for the poor, both black and
white... And then came the build-
up of Viet Nam. And I watched this
promise broken..."

INTERCUT HOOVER
Like a litany, the invective grinds out, sibilant and raw.

HOOVER
Weakling. Anarchist...

ON THE SCREEN (STOCK): KING #2

DR. KING
"The poor people's March on
Washington will demand total,
direct, and immediate abolition of
poverty."

HOOVER
This -- is -- commonism!

ON THE SCREEN (STOCK): KING #3

DR. KING
"We seek to say to the nation that if
you don't straighten up, then you're
writing your own obituary. We must
love each other, or perish."

HOOVER
Love the white women -- whoremonger !
82.

Hoover pounds his desk violently.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. MURTAUGH'S HOME
Jeff's eyes do not leave Murtaugh.
JEFF

Did Hoover hate King enough to have
him killed?

MURTAUGH
At first he thought that he could
assassinate King's character -- his
reputation.

FLASHBACK:
INT. HOOVER'S ELECTRONIC ROOM

Murtaugh and TWO other AGENTS stand while Hoover sits and
listens to a TAPE -- a tape with MUFFLED SOUNDS that are
completely incoherent.

HOOVER
. Where's this one from?

AGENT #1
Stockholm.

Hoover beats on the table, his voice choked.

HOOVER
They gave that whoremaster the
Nobel Prize!

Hoover wipes his hands; slips a mint into his mouth; juts out
his jaw.

HOOVER
(continuing)
Next!

Agent Two puts on a second tape: breathing, SOUNDS of
BEDSPRINGS, soft laughter.

HOOVER
(continuing)
Turn it up... more... louder!
83.

Hoover listens to what may be the sounds of sexual
intercourse. He is clearly excited. The Agents avert their
eyes from the terrible scene.

HOOVER
(continuing)
Again. Is that him?

MURTAUGH
Well, sir, it's actually Reverend
Abernathy's room, but he --

HOOVER
It's King!... I know King.

AGENT #2
Yes, sir.

Hoover rises, snarlingyorE)
HOOVER

Send it to King with a letter

saying if he doesn't kill himself,

we'll release it to the press.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. MURTAUGH'S HOME
Start tight on Jeff's incredulous expression.

JEFF
They didn't actually send...

MURTAUGH
We did. Had it postmarked in
Atlanta, but it was written in D.C.

JEFF
Who authorized the wiretaps?
MURTAUGH
The Attorney General. Bobby
Kennedy.
JEFF

I thought Bobby hated Hoover.

MURTAUGH
He did, but he loved his own
brother more.
(letting it sink in)
We wired King for years.
84.
MURTAUGH( CONT'D)

Hoover forced Bobby to sign off on
it. Blackmailed him with tapes of
Jack... in inappropriate
circumstances. Hoover had tapes on
everybody. Then something happened.

FLASHBACK:
HOOVER'S OFFICE - MARCH 1968

Tight on television. Lyndon Johnson is speaking straight
into camera.

LBJ
. What we won when all of our
people united must not now be
lost... Acqmokmgly, I shall not
seek, and I will not accept, the
nomination of my party for another
term as your President...

HOOVER (V.0.)
Why didn't I know about this?

Widen to show Hoover. A nervous Agent stands to one side.

AGENT
Nobody did, sir.

HOOVER
That little bastard, Bobby! If he
thinks I'll let him be President...

AGENT
Sir, Senator Kennedy has been
trying to call Dr. King. We think
he might offer King the Vice
President slot.

HOOVER
That is not going to happen.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. MURTAUGH'S HOUSE - PRESENT

MURTAUGH
Hoover was in a panic. If Kennedy
was elected, Hoover was finished.
The Poor People's March was just a
month off.
85.
MURTAUGH( CONT'D)

For Hoover it was a state of
National Emergency. Then King
signed his own death warrant.

FLASHBACK:
INT. FBI AUDIO ROOM - MARCH 1968

Hoover, Murtaugh and three other agents are listening toa
TAPE RECORDING of Dr. King:

KING
(on tape)

. The efforts by the FBI to
destroy our movement by peddling
gossip about my sex life must be
exposed.

LAWYER
(on tape)
You cannot do this, Martin. It's
suicide.

KING
(on tape)
We can weather any storm. I must
make a public confession even if it
means that the Movement goes on
without me.

LAWYER
(on tape)
There is no Movement without you.

KING
(on tape; laughing)

There'd better be. Anyway, I

appreciate your counsel, but my

mind is made up.
Murtaugh rises and lunges out of the room.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. MURTAUGH'S HOUSE -- THE PRESENT

Murtaugh turns away from Jeff, as if ashamed by what he
remembers so clearly.
86.

MURTAUGH
King was different than the others.
Simple character assassination
wouldn't be enough to stop him.

FLASHBACK:
INT. J. EDGAR HOOVER'S OFFICE - MARCH, 1968

Murtaugh and several OTHER AGENTS are seated in chairs in
front of Hoover's desk. They bend forward like slaves
waiting for their master's pronouncement

HOOVER
What hotel is King staying in?

MURTAUGH
In Memphis, sir?

HOOVER
Yes, for goodness sake!

1ST AGENT
Rivermont. Here's a photograph, sir

The Agent places a BLOW-UP of the Holiday Inn Rivermont on an
easel. The photo, taken from a distance, shows the isolation
of the large structure. Hoover shakes his head negatively.

HOOVER
No good. Get him out of there.

2ND AGENT
Well, sir, we have a plan that --

HOOVER
Let me hear it.

2ND AGENT
We thought of a campaign in the
news media to point out that King
wants to stay in a luxury white
hotel while there are Negro-owned
hotels that are suffering for lack
of business.

HOOVER
Good. Wants to conduct a "lay-in"
there.

Hoover smiles slightly, the others follow suit.
87.

HOOVER (CONT'D)
(continuing)
What Negro motels offer the best
opportunity?

2ND AGENT
We think the Lorraine Motel, sir.

The Second Agent places a BLOW-UP of the Lorraine Motel on
the easel.

HOOVER
What's across the street from it?
2ND AGENT
There's an embankment --
HOOVER
A bank?
2ND AGENT
Sorry, sir, I meant to say an
embankment -- a cliff --
HOOVER

I know what an embankment is!

2ND AGENT
On top of the, uh, embankment are
some rooming houses and at the
corner is a fire station.

HOOVER
They have Negro firemen there?

2ND AGENT
We'll find that out, sir.

HOOVER
Well, what's the plan to get him
into the Negro motel?

3RD AGENT
We have prepared editorials that
will be placed with sympathetic
media outlets. A cooperative
Senator might even be persuaded to
read the release into the record.

The Third Agent passes the speech.
88.

HOOVER
Let me see it... "This self-
seeking rabble rouser..."

As Hoover reads the speech, overlap Jeff.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. MURTAUGH'S HOUSE -- THE PRESENT

CLOSE ON a 1968 Memphis newspaper editorial calling for King
to stay at the Lorraine, which Jeff holds in his hands.

JEFF
(reading)
",... rabble rouser will not share
the squalor of his followers.
Instead, he will be conducting a
lay-in at a posh hotel..."

Jeff sets the clipping down.

MURTAUGH
We packed the papers with
editorials. Finally King cancelled
his reservations at the Holiday Inn
and booked rooms at the Lorraine
Motel... And it was built like a
shooting gallery...

JEFF
Jesus...

MURTAUGH
Strange thing was, the King party
was originally booked on the ground
floor in the back...

FLASHBACK:
EXT. LORRAINE MOTEL - DAY - APRIL 3, 1968

A DARK-SKINNED MAN of East Indian appearance walks toward the
manager's office.

MURTAUGH (V.0.)
...The motel owner said that a man
came by the office and asked that
the King party be moved to the
second floor, to room 306.

The man knocks on the Manager's door. A black woman opens
the door and listens to the man's instructions.

No one connected with SCLC knows
who that man was.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. MURTAUGH'S HOUSE - THE PRESENT
Jeff sits quietly.

MURTAUGH
That last night, King went to speak
at a church. His regular driver,
Solomon Jones, drove him. I was on
surveillance outside the church.

FLASHBACK:
EXT. MEMPHIS CHURCH -- APRIL 3, 1968 - - NIGHT

Murtaugh sits in his unmarked FBI car. Detective Redditt
sits in his unmarked MPD car, across the street. Each is
conducting surveillance. Rain pours down.

MURTAUGH (V.0.)
It was pouring rain...

From the church come SHOUTS of "AMEN." THUNDER.
INT. CHURCH -- APRIL 3, 1968 -- NIGHT - - STOCK

KING
"... Well, I don't know what will
happen now. We've got some
difficult days ahead. But it
doesn't matter with me now. Because
I've been to the mountain top. And
I don't mind. Like anybody, I
would like to live a long life.
Longevity has its place. But I'm
not concerned about that now. I
just want to do God's will. And
He's allowed me to go up to the
mountain. And I've looked over."

EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
The heartbreaking last oration of MLK reaches out to the

street, as do SOUNDS of the CONGREGATION... RAIN and THUNDER.
Murtaugh and Redditt sit in their separate vehicles.

INT. MURTAUGH'S HOUSE -- THE PRESENT

JEFF
Did Hoover have him killed?

MURTAUGH

He wanted him dead. I don't know
if he ordered the killing. But I
know he did nothing to stop it.

(overwhelmed)
They hated him. And they never
stopped, not even after he was
dead. That's why there was no real
investigation. Our Security Squad
was assigned by Hoover to destroy
King's legacy, to destroy his
widow's reputation...

JEFF
Would you testify to that?

MURTAUGH
I'll say what I know. But if you
want all the answers, you'll have to
subpoena the files. All the files.

EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - NEXT DAY

The setting sun casts erie shadows. Jeff and Lawson walk by
the embankment just below the room where Grace once lived.

LAWSON
Did he seem credible?

JEFF
You'll never find a better witness
than Arthur Murtaugh. He has
notes, a good memory, anda
conscience. And he has guts.
91.

The Reverend looks at his protege, his smile matures into a
low laugh.

LAWSON
And so do you.

Jeff looks up at the bathroom window of the rooming house
(the room from which Ray supposedly fired the shot).

LAWSON
(continuing)
That's the window where James Earl
Ray supposedly perched on a bathtub
and shot King.

JEFF

Looks like a clear shot.
LAWSON

It's a question of tense.
JEFF

What?
LAWSON

It's a clear shot now. But was it
a clear shot on April 4th, 1968?

INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

Close On a blur of black and white images. The WHIRRING
sound of a microfiche machine is evident. The scrolling
images slow and finally stop.

ON JEFF

Bent over the machine. One image has caught his eye: A
black and white photograph of the Rooming House as viewed
from the Lorraine. Trees and bushes grow on the embankment
obscuring the sightline from the bathroom.

JEFF
God bless the Associated Press.
This image was taken March 29, a
week before the shooting.

LAWSON
Look at that tree.

Jeff makes some notes and focuses on a short article, while
Lawson pours over files.

Why'd the cops let them destroy a
crime scene?

Jeff doesn't respond. He is reloading the machine and
searching for something. Finding it, he turns to Lawson.

JEFF
Did you ever hear of a reporter for
the New York Times named Caldwell?

LAWSON
Earl Caldwell. There weren't many
black reporters working for The
Times back then.

JEFF

He's enjoying the evening breeze. An explosive SOUND.
Caldwell is startled. He turns and looks across Mulberry
Street.

JEFF (V.0.)
. After the shot, I looked up to
see a white male, dressed in
coveralls in the bushes...

CALDWELL'S POV

An area of brush surrounds the sloping area at the rear of
the rooming house. A white male wearing coveralls is
crouched in the bushes. There is no gun evident.

JEFF (V.0)
(continuing)
...A black sedan drove directly in
front of me, cutting off my view. The
man vanished over the embankment.
The sedan kept moving, back and
forth...

Caldwell's line of sight is blurred by a black sedan that
passes frantically back and forth in front of the motel.
Tires SQUEAL. Caldwell looks at the car, then back to the
bushes. The man is gone.

Caldwell wrote the story, but
neither the Memphis PD nor the FBI
ever questioned him.

I'm not surprised. Even Abernathy
didn't know who he was.

McCollough led a group of militants.
Called themselves "The Invaders".
After the shooting, word started to
leak out that McCollough was really
an undercover cop.

(sits back)
So, if the shot didn't come from
the rooming house... if the man
Grace saw was just a decoy, if the
gun he dropped was just a plant...
why did Ray plead guilty?

LAWSON
Maybe it's time we try to talk to him.

The SOUND of a W engine comes up.
EXT. PETROS, TENNESSEE - NEXT DAY

Lawson is driving his bug. Gospel music plays on his radio.
Jeff sits beside him.

JEFF
You think Ray was involved?

Jim, with humor and a kind of preacher's rhythm, sets up a
question and response as if for the congregation.

LAWSON
Let's see what he could have done.
Did Ray dismantle the police
protection? I need a witness.

JEFF
No. That was Mr. Holloman.

LAWSON
Say, Hallelujah. Did Ray saw down
the trees? I need a witness.
96.

JEFF
I can bear witness, brother. No, sir!

LAWSON
Say, Hallelujah.

JEFF
(seriously)
Did Ray fire the shot? I needa
witness.

LAWSON
No way, brother. Ray was a
bumbling burglar, not a marksman.
If he was part of a plot, it's not
likely he would have been the
triggerman.

JEFF
But Ray would be a perfect fallguy.

LAWSON
Say Amen, brother.

JEFF
Amen.

LAWSON'S POV
The Brushy Mountain Penitentiary Entrance Gate just ahead.
INT. PRISON CONFERENCE ROOM - - DAY

There is a steel table with four chairs. There are bars on
the windows and the light spills through in patterns. JAMES
EARL RAY is seated at the table. He is now almost fifty years
old. He speaks in a soft twang. Jeff is focusing on Ray
through a VIDEO CAMERA. Lawson has files in front of him.

JEFF
Mr. Ray, why did you plead guilty,
if you now say you're innocent?

RAY
I had to. But I told the Judge
that I would not agree that there
was no conspiracy.

LAWSON
Why did you have to plead guilty?
97.

RAY
Did you ever see the cell in
Memphis, where they kept me for
eight months?

FLASHBACK:
INT. SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED CELL -- JAMES EARL RAY'S POV

The cell is brightly lit, painted stark white. Two guards
are stationed outside the cell. Television cameras are
focused on Ray and are monitored in a control room by two
other guards. Banks of hot lights focus on him.

INTERCUT -- CONTROL ROOM AND CELL

RAY (V.0.)
Eight months. They never turned
out the lights. Day or night. One
of the guards, he had a nervous
breakdown. I thought it was going
to kill me...

INTERCUT Ray suffering in jail cell, 1968; and on the
monitor.

RAY (V.0.)
(continuing)
One day, this big-shot lawyer came
in. He was so full of himself, he
could strut sittin' down.

INT. RAY'S CELL - - 1968

PERCY FOREMAN, the famous Texas defense lawyer, talks to Ray.

FOREMAN
You know me?

RAY
No.

FOREMAN

I'm Percy Foreman. Without doubt
the best and most famous damn
criminal lawyer in the whole USA.
And I'm here to tell you those free
lawyers you got... They're selling
you out, son.

RAY
I hear what you say. Don't mean I
believe it.
98.

FOREMAN
I can save you, boy. I have so
much money, I don't need you to pay
me nothing. I have defended seven
hundred capital cases and every one
of them is still walking around,
and I mean outside, free. Well,
except one, but he was a fool and
didn't follow my advice.

 

RAY
What's your advice?

ON MONITOR

FOREMAN
You fire those clowns and I
guarantee you'll walk out of here a
free man.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. RAY'S CELL -- THE PRESENT
Shadows of bars fall across Ray, Lawson and Jeff.

RAY
After I told the judge that Foreman
was my lawyer, he warned me that I
couldn't ever change lawyers again.
I said, "Fine. I got the best
lawyer in America." Then Foreman
came into my cell --

FLASHBACK:
INT. RAY'S CELL -- 1968 -- AND ON THE MONITOR

FOREMAN
If you don't plead guilty, you're
going to the Tennessee dance hall,
boy, and that's the e-lectric
chair. They'll fry you.

RAY
I didn't do nothing. Just bought a
gun for a friend. That's why my
prints were on it.

FOREMAN
What's that got to do with the
price of beer?
99.

RAY
I want a trial. My old lawyers
said I could win at trial.

FOREMAN
I didn't want to have to do this, but
there's someone here to see you.

The Guards watch the scene on the monitor as an FBI AGENT
enters.

FOREMAN
(continuing)
This here is an FBI man. Show him
your I.D. The Agent does.

AGENT
Your father's a real old man, isn't
he?

RAY
Yes, sir.

AGENT

And he escaped from the
penitentiary in Fort Madison, Iowa,
in 1921, didn't he?

Ray freezes. The Agent pulls out documents. Foreman lights
a cigar.

AGENT
(continuing)
We found out where he's hiding. You
don't cooperate with your attorney -
- we're going to send your daddy

back to prison -- and let him die
behind bars. Here's the warrant.
Read it.

Foreman spits on the floor. Ray's head drops.

FOREMAN
If you say you didn't kill King,
you're going to get a jolt a'
Edison medicine. And your Daddy
will rot in the process. You let
me plead the case, and they'll let
you live.

Ray is exhausted. He rubs his eyes in the blinding light.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. RAY'S CELL -- THE PRESENT

LAWSON
So, you pleaded guilty?

RAY
I was confused from no sleep, bein'
in that white cell for months, so
yeah, I confessed. That night they
put me in a regular cell. I got my
first night's sleep in eight
months. I woke up and knew I'd
made a mistake. Asked for a new
trial. And that was eight years
ago.

Silence, except for dim PRISON SOUNDS and a far-off bell.

LAWSON
Why were you in Memphis on April

RAY
I had broke out from the
penitentiary in Jefferson City,
Missouri, so I needed money. I
never had been convicted of any
crime of violence, I never even hit
anyone in my whole life.

I wasn't going to do nothing

violent.
INT. BAR

A man ("RAOUL") approaches Ray at the bar.

MAN
How about a drink -- James?
Ray jumps -- how does this stranger know his name? Ray is

white with fear. (We have seen this stranger before: in the
Grace Walden memory sequence. )
EXT. USED

RAY (V.0.)
Like it was a miracle, "Raoul"
showed up.

JEFF (V.0.)
Who was he? What was his last
name?

RAY (V.0.)
I don't even know his first name,
he just said "Raoul." He said he
had a job for me.
CAR LOT - - DAY

RAY (V.0.)
I went with Raoul to a car
dealership. He bought me a car
Everything was cash money.

Raoul peels off bills, he and Ray buy a new white Mustang.

EXT. GUN STORE - - DAY

Raoul and

Ray drive up in the white Mustang.

RAY (V.0.)
He had a deal to sell rifles to
some guy in Latin America. He
needed a sample gun to show. But I
got the wrong gun. He made me go
back.

Raoul shouts at Ray behind closed car windows. They get out
of the car. Raoul stalks away and gets into another car.

INT. GUN STORE - - DAY

The Clerk

RAY

(to CLERK)
Yes sir, my boss said this is the
wrong kind. Shoulda asked for...

paper )
Uh, a 30.06 caliber, Remington
Model 760.

suspiciously eyes an insecure Ray.

EXT. HIGHWAY

Ray drives alone toward Memphis in his white Mustang.
102.

RAY (V.O)
I gave Raoul the gun. He then told
me to rent a room in Memphis. Gave
me the name of the flophouse.
INT. ROOMING HOUSE -- APRIL 4, 1968 -- 5:00 P.M.

Raoul passes Charlie Stephens (drunk) on the stairs of the
rooming house, and heads into

INT. RAY'S ROOM

Ray sits reading a newspaper. The gun is on the bed. He
looks up at Raoul. (SOUND of Charlie YELLING at Grace, o.s.)

RAOUL
The buyer'll be here in an hour. Go
take a walk. Be back at six. Leave
the car and the rifle here.
Ray is worried. Something is wrong. He leaves.
EXT. GAS STATION
Ray fills the Mustang. He is jumpy, smelling trouble.
RAY (V.0.)
I started to take a walk but then I
remembered that there wasn't hardly
any gas in the car. I knew that
when Raoul finished the gun deal
he'd want to drive right out.
EXT. ROOMING HOUSE

RAY (V.0.)
But when I got back...

The Mustang approaches, Ray at the wheel. He suddenly reacts
to something.

RAY'S P.O.V.

SIRENS, pandemonium, police.

BACK TO RAY

He spins the car around and speeds away.

CUT BACK TO:
103.

INT. RAY'S CELL -- THE PRESENT

JEFF
Did you ever think what would've
happened if you had just gone for a
walk?

RAY
I thought about it a lot. I
would've walked back into the
rooming house right after the shot
was fired -- Raoul and the car
would've been gone and they'd've
arrested me on the spot.

JEFF
If you didn't do anything -- why
did you run?

RAY
I was a fugitive -- I owed time to
Missouri. If they even got me for
a parking ticket, I'd probably
spend the rest of my life in jail.

LAWSON
You remember what Raoul looked
like?

RAY

That man is cut in my memory. Ain't
never gonna forget him.

JEFF
Was he about fifty - short, wiry -
pointed chin and a pointed nose?

RAY
(taken aback)
Now, how did you know all that?

JEFF
Did he look anything like any of
these three men?

Jeff reaches into his briefcase and pulls out three IDENTIKIT
DRAWINGS. He hands them to Ray. Ray looks at all three and
pushes two of them aside. He picks one and studies it.

RAY
I think this is him. At least, it
sure favors him. Where'd you get
it?
104.

JEFF
From a woman -- named Grace Walden.

RAY
(beat)
Who's Grace Walden?

INT. CHURCH RECTORY - - AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON Grace, animated, talking on the telephone.

GRACE
Well, she won't let me stop eating.
(beat)
Alright then. Goodbye now.

Grace hangs up, smiles. WIDEN TO REVEAL Sister Ione and
Willy having lunch with Grace. One of the sanitation workers
stands in the b.g.

GRACE
(continuing; to Ione)
That was Jeff, checking on me and
hoping we'd save him some pecan
pie.

Ione smiles, proud.
INT. LAWSON'S OFFICE - - AFTERNOON

Jeff hangs up the phone. Lawson and Jeff are working. The
bulletin board is now covered with notes and cards.

JEFF
We got plenty of witnesses, but we
need more hard evidence.

LAWSON
Either way, we gotta go with what
we got... Sprague's not going to

wait around forever.

The door opens and Katy appears. Both men sit in silence
looking at her. She is holding a file.

JEFF
Katy...

LAWSON
Come in, sit down.
105.

KATY
I've been thinking about what you
said, Reverend... and you're right.

I want to apologize.

LAWSON
There's no need.

KATY

I realized that the more things I
wanted, the more things I was
willing to compromise.

(a beat)
I located the police records on the
Assassination. The entire file is
stored in the Municipal Building on
Maple.

JEFF
We can get Sprague to subpoena
those files. They'll corroborate
everything that Redditt and Newsum
told us. Those files are a gold

mine.

LAWSON
Are we looking at a new recruit
here?

KATY

You're looking at temporary help.
It seems I'm between jobs at the
moment.

EXT. CHURCH - - AFTERNOON
Choir practice is over. The CHILDREN are walking into the

parking lot. Jeff and Katy exit the church and begin walking
toward their cars.

KATY
So, how's Grace?

JEFF
Happy and putting on weight.
Speaking of which... I'm starving.

You eaten?

They move across the street. The children are milling around
and we see a TRUCK in the B.G. moving slowly.

BEGIN SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE - DAY
106.

Everything cranks painfully slow... The TRUCK moves toward
them. We see the children laughing, walking. The truck is
even with Jeff and Katy when a GRENADE flies out of the
window and lands on the pavement.

ANGLE - JEFF AND KATY - SLO MO

He spots the grenade. Jeff throws Katy down and dives on top
of her.

TICK - TICK - TICK -

Play the tension. Several long beats.
INTERCUT - GRENADE AND CHILDREN

Then Jeff gets to his feet.

RESUME - REGULAR SPEED

He moves to the grenade and kicks it with his toe. Then
reaches down and picks it up.

JEFF'S POV - THE GRENADE
It says: G.I. JOE
MOVE IN - ON JEFF

JEFF

(continuing)
A damn toy.

Jeff hurls it to the ground.
INT. JENKINS ESTATE - NIGHT
The door BANGS open and Jeff strides into the house and
upstairs to his old bedroom. Harold is at the far end of the
foyer, dusting. He looks up, alarmed.
INT. JENKINS ESTATE - DEN
Lucas is reading. He hears the commotion and gets up.
INT. JENKINS ESTATE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Close on a drawer as Jeff rummages through it. He grabs an

old pistol and slams a clip into the revolver. Widen to
reveal the environs of his old room. He exits the room.

INT. JENKINS ESTATE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jeff heads down the hall but stops suddenly. He sees his
father approaching. Lucas stares at the gun in Jeff's hand.

LUCAS
What the devil are you doing?

Jeff starts down the stairs and Lucas follows.

LUCAS
(continuing)
Stop. I need to speak to you.
Whatta' you doing?

Jeff has reached the downstairs landing.

JEFF
Non-violenq@ORe ja great concept,
but I'm not signing up for it yet

Jeff starts to leave.

LUCAS
Stop. We need to talk.

JEFF
Why now? Branson lean on you?

LUCAS
That's crazy.

JEFF
Why did you and your friends offer
the money to bribe Charlie Stephens
-- to lie? And why did you bury
Grace in that hell hole?

LUCAS

I didn't.
JEFF

You were part of it!... why?!
LUCAS

I didn't know!

JEFF
You didn't want to know!

LUCAS
I loved Martin King. He's a page
in a history book to you.
108.
LUCAS (CONT'D)

I was his lawyer here, his friend.
I was his friend when it could cost
you your life to even walk down the
street with him.

JEFF
You know that the government killed
your "friend". And that you helped
to cover it up. And you're still
doing it! You and Branson and the
Judge --

LUCAS
When Martin died that night, the
city went up in flames. The whole
country was burning... President
Johnson asked me to personally
reassure Mrs. King that the
Department (oORH)stice would "leave
no stone unturned".

JEFF
(sarcastic)
They sure did a helluva job.

LUCAS
We couldn't bring him back. All we
had left was the memory. And they
made it plain that could be taken
away, too. They had evidence
against him. The FBI showed it to
me! Those sons-of- bitches!

JEFF
Showed you what?

Lucas shakes his head and turns away.

JEFF
(continuing)
They played a dirty tape for you.
Didn't they?

Lucas looks up at Jeff, amazed.

LUCAS

It was different ten years ago.
Jeff... You can't imagine how
powerful Hoover was. He was the
secret police -- for fifty years!
No one could stand up to Hoover. No
one.

(drops his voice)
109.
LUCAS(CONT'D)
I tried to tell Martin, I begged
him not to mix the politics of
Vietnam with Civil Rights. But he
wouldn't listen. And when he tried
to change the economic system - it
was all over.

Jeff leans in; they are face-to-face, eye-to-eye.

JEFF
No. You wouldn't listen. King had
already decided to go public on the
question of his "marital infidelity."

LUCAS

You know that?
JEFF

I've heard the FBI tape.
(MORE)

Lucas's head drops. Jeff moves in for the moment of truth
his voice hoarse and charged, his breathing short.

JEFF
(continuing)
Don't you see what you've done? You
covered up Hoover's crimes -- not

King's!

Jeff moves down the stairs, where Harold opens the door for
him. He has heard the entire thing. The two men lock eyes.

HAROLD
You be real careful out there, Mr.
Jeff. Real careful.

INT. JEFF'S LAW OFFICE - - DAY

Jeff is filling a briefcase with files. The SOUND of the
door opening. Jeff turns to see Branson in the doorway.

BRANSON
There's a rumor that there'll be an
announcement from Washington, that
Congress will form a Select
Committee to investigate the
Kennedy and King murders.

JEFF
I'm aware of that.

BRANSON
We understand that Miz Walden may
be called as a witness.
110.
BRANSON(CONT'D)
Our firm takes the position that
any information you have gathered
from Miz Walden belongs to us. It
is privileged.

JEFF
The privilege runs to the client.
It's really up to Grace.

BRANSON
That old lady'1l do what you tell
her!
Jeff starts to leave.
BRANSON
(continuing)
Have you thought this out? I can
destroy you. I own you.
JEFF
You see, that's where you're wrong,
Bill. You don't own me. You gotta
bring some ass to kick some ass.

Jeff walks out. He walks down the corridor, past Clay Morgan
who has heard it all.

JEFF
(continuing)
He shoots. He scores.
INT. BRANSON'S OFFICE - - DAY
He moves into the room and picks up the phone and dials.

BRANSON
Lemme talk to him.

INTERCUT - N.D. OFFICE -- DAY

BRANSON
He wouldn't listen.

EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE LORRAINE MOTEL - - DAY

Jeff is moving along the lower sidewalk in front of the
Motel.

LAWSON'S VOICE
Up here...

Jeff looks up and sees Lawson and Katy. He hurries up the
stairs and stops in front of the room where King was shot.

JEFF
This was King's room, wasn't it?

LAWSON
Yes.
(points across the street)
And there's the rooming house. And
the embankment. And the fire
station. It all happened right
here...

FLASHBACK:
BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE

A tightly edited, chronological reprise details everything
that has been discovered about the events.

LAWSON
...It started when the FBI forced
King out of the Rivermont, got him
to move to the Lorraine.

JEFF (V.0.)
Then the unknown man gets the room
changed from the ground floor...

LAWSON (V.0)
The black cops and th.e black
firemen were ordered out of the
area.

JEFF (V.0.)
Ray says he got in the Mustang and
left the area.

LAWSON (V.0.)
Charlie Stephens, the government's
eyewitness, was outside taking a

THEIR POV

A fifty year old black man, SOLOMON JONES, stands by an old
black town car.

JEFF
(to Lawson)
Who's that?

LAWSON
You remember Caldwell's story...
The black sedan that was driving
back and forth. That's Solomon
Jones.
(calling out)
Brother Solomon. Thanks for
coming.

JEFF
(to Lawson)
Jim, how'd you find him?

LAWSON
I've known Solomon for years. He
was Martin's driver.
(to Solomon)
Brother Solomon, could you stand
where you were that afternoon.

Solomon walks to a spot about twenty yards away.

LAWSON
(continuing)
So, Dr. King was standing right
about here, where I am?

SOLOMON
That's right. And I was standing
by the car, waiting to take him to
dinner at Reverend Kyle's.

Precious Lord, take my hand...

The HYMN CONTINUES OVER. King is only seen in silhouette as
he comes out of the door of his Lorraine Motel room. Solomon
Jones looks up and sees him. Starts to get into the car.
SOLOMON V.O.
(continuing)
I went to get into the car so I
could pull it up.
ANGLE up to the MINISTERS on the Balcony, talking.
SOLOMON V.O.
(continuing)
And that's when I heard the shot.

In black and white, King turns and a shot rings out. The
body passes through the frame.

TIGHT ON KING'S HAND

Bloody. It lands on the deck, convulses once and lies still.
CUT BACK TO:

EXT. LORRAINE MOTEL - PRESENT

Jeff checks his notes, standing there, lost in the moment.

LAWSON
OK, Jeff, run it down from there.

JEFF
The Reporter from the New York
Times looked out and saw a white
man dressed in coveralls, in the
hedges beside the Rooming House.

FLASHBACK:
EXT. LORRAINE MOTEL - DAY - APRIL 4, 1968
A WHITE MAN IN COVERALLS is crouched in the bushes.
JEFF (V.0.)
Caldwell saw a puff of smoke. Then
a man in coveralls jumped over the
wall.

The Man in coveralls jumps over the wall, starts to flee. The
black sedan swerves back and forth trying to pursue.
114.

SOLOMON (V.0.)
I saw him too. I tried to follow
him, I really did. I really tried.
I was hemmed in.

BACK TO:
EXT. LORRAINE MOTEL - PRESENT

LAWSON
Is that what you told the FBI?

SOLOMON
That's just it, they never talked
to me. Reverend Orange, he saw the
same thing and they never talked to
him either. Seemed they already
had their eyewitness.

FLASHBACK:
EXT. LORRAINE MOTEL - BLACK AND WHITE - APRIL 4, 1968

The chaos just after the shooting. In the parking lot a cop
runs toward the balcony. He looks up, seems to know one of
the men standing over King.

CoP
The shot! Where did it come from?

SOLOMON (V.0.)
The guy on the end of the balcony,
he points. But not to the
embankment. He points to the
rooming house. Abernathy and the
others see him, and then they do
the same thing. McCollough points
to the Rooming House above the
hedge. The other Reverends point
there also.

ANGLE ON SOLOMON

He is panicked. He sees the white Man in the coveralls jump
over the wall below - clearly not where they're pointing.

SOLOMON (V.0.)
(continuing)
I saw the man jump off the
embankment. I jumped in my car. I
tried...

Solomon jumps into his car and tries to drive after the Man
but can't get the car turned around.

BACK TO:
EXT. LORRAINE MOTEL - PRESENT

Lawson, Jeff and Katy are looking at Solomon, who has tears
in his eyes.

LAWSON
Solomon, that guy on the balcony,
his name was Marrell McCollough. He
was an undercover cop.

KATY
The key witness was on the
government's payroll?

JEFF
Still is.
(checks his notes)
Meanwhile, Grace was in her room
across the street.

FLASHBACK:
INT./EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - APRIL 4, 1968

Grace sees a MAN run past the door of her room carrying
something. The man heads outside, drops the gun. Flees.

JEFF (V.0.)
A man flees down the hall and out
of the building. A few minutes
later the cops conveniently find a
rifle with Ray's fingerprints left
in broad daylight.

A COP reaches down and picks up the bundle.
LAWSON (V.0.)
The weapon is never linked to the
death slug.
Reprise images of the autopsy photo and the bullet in pieces.
JEFF (V.O.)
The next morning, the City
purposely alters the crime scene.

Reprise images of the trees being cut down.
116.

KATY (V.0.)
And, later on that summer, they
came back for Grace.

Reprise images of Grace being taken from her room.

JEFF (V.0.)
They kicked down the door to her
room and dragged her away. Locked
her up for eight years.

And that's where this whole thing
began for me.

HARD CUT TO:
INT. SPRAGUE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

TIGHT on Sprague. He is just finishing going through the

SPRAGUE
Pretty damn impressive. You can
officially tell Fauntroy, the
Committee has a Special Counsel.

Lawson exhales. It's been a long road.

JEFF
Okay. What about Grace Walden?

SPRAGUE
You can tell her she's a free
woman. She doesn't have to hide
from anyone. You have my word.

LAWSON
What about the Memphis PD files
that Katy found?

SPRAGUE
I'm going to file a subpoena for
those. You pick ‘em up, bring 'em
with you to D.C. I'm also going to
file a subpoena demanding the
production of all relevant
documents from the FBI, the CIA and
Army Intelligence.

want to see all King files.

KATY
We were told we could pick them up
from you at nine A.M. It's ten

Jeff explodes out into the alley. The Cops grab him and keep
him at bay as the trash bin blazes away. Lawson and Katy
arrive. They stop. PUSH IN ON LAWSON through the flames as

You were the conscience of this
country.
119.

GRACE
You talk like that -- they're going
to call you crazy, too.

Jeff doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. He hugs Grace in
a mighty embrace. The SOUND of jet engines can be heard.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
A 737 approaches the runway and touches down.
EXT. CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE BUILDING -- WASHINGTON - - DAY
Lawson and Jeff run up the steps, carrying two large folders
of evidence. A GUARD follows them, then ANOTHER GUARD trots
up to help the first,(Miwm)a THIRD GUARD dogs their heels.
INT. BUILDING

Jeff and Lawson walk down a hallway. They are lost in the
maze of corridors. Lawson approaches a black SECURITY GUARD.

LAWSON
Brother, could you point us to Mr.
Sprague's office?
The Guard indicates the way.
ANOTHER HALLWAY

Jeff and Lawson round a corner and head for Sprague's office.
They get to the door marked: RICHARD SPRAGUE.

SPRAGUE (V.0.)
Get your hands off of me.

Lawson looks to Jeff with concern. They enter
INT. SPRAGUE'S DC OFFICE

Lawson and Jeff enter to see Sprague being forcibly ejected
from his office by two AGENTS. One Agent is CLARK NELSON.

SPRAGUE
You have absolutely no right to
invade my office, damn it.

AGENT NELSON
It's the government's office. My
orders are to seal the office.
120.
AGENT NELSON(CONT'D)

You have a problem with that, take
it to the Attorney General.

SPRAGUE
(to Nelson)
Am I free to go?

AGENT NELSON
As far as I'm concerned, you're
already gone.

INT. MARBLE CORRIDORS - DAY
Jeff and Lawson walk with a furious Sprague.

SPRAGUE
Guess you don't read the big city
papers. The New York Times and the
Washington Post ran editorials
demanding that I be fired. Then
Congress refused to fund the
investigation.

JEFF
On what grounds?

SPRAGUE
The FBI demanded the right to
screen my staff.

LAWSON
And you said no?

SPRAGUE
I said hell no! I also mentioned
that the FBI was a suspect in the
cover-up.

JEFF
But you have subpoena powers.

SPRAGUE
So I was told. But someone forgot
to tell the FBI.
They pause. Every passerby suddenly seems to be suspicious.

JEFF
Is it over?
121.

SPRAGUE
Not quite. My last official act
was to arrange for a key witness to
testify on Monday, at the first
public session.

LAWSON
They can stop it or change it.
SPRAGUE
No, they can't -- because the
witness's name has already been
published.
JEFF
Who is it?
SPRAGUE

You.

(Jeff reacts)
Under the circumstances, I don't
recommend you show up.

EXT. REFLECTING POOL, WASHINGTON D.C. - - AFTERNOON

Lawson and Jeff stroll along the site of MLK's famous
demonstration.

LAWSON
I'm sorry. I was wrong. The times
haven't changed. Hoover died, but
his ghost is still here.

JEFF
You didn't say it'd be easy.

LAWSON

If they can kick Sprague out, if
they can burn files and turn down
subpoenas... the whole thing will
just be a puppet show. The FBI
will be investigating the FBI.

(a beat)
Jeff, I asked Martin to come to
Memphis. I often wonder what it
would be like if he were still with
us. I don't want to wonder that
about you...

JEFF
If the truth doesn't come out, the
tragedy's just going to be
repeated.
122.

Lawson is moved by Jeff's transformation.

LAWSON
I pray I've done the right thing.

JEFF
You did the only thing. What's
that part -- from Genesis you had
me read? You know -- "And when
they, uh, came, uh --"

Lawson turns away, not wanting to recall the prophetic images
of the story of Joseph.

JEFF
(continuing)
You know it.

LAWSON
"And when they saw him far off,
even before he came near, they
conspired to slay him. And they
said one to another, Behold this
dreamer. Come now and let us slay
him, and cast him into the pit and
we will say, some evil beast has
devoured him: and we shall see what
will become of his dreams."

Jeff looks at Lawson who gazes off at the empty steps leading
to the Lincoln Monument. Light glints of the reflecting
pool.

TIGHT ON LAWSON

Deep in thought, back with Martin again.

MARTIN LUTHER KING (V.0)
I have a dream...

SUBLIMINAL CUT:
NEWSREEL FOOTAGE - BLACK AND WHITE - AUGUST 28, 1963

King is speaking on the steps of the Lincoln Monument.
123.

MARTIN LUTHER KING
...that my four children will one
day live in a nation where they
will not be judged by the color of
their skin but by the content of
their character. I have a dream
today!

CUT BACK TO:
EXT. REFLECTING POOL - SUNSET

Lawson and Jeff are lost in thought. The cacophonous SOUND
of reporters yelling questions begins to rise under.

EXT. STEPS OF THE HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - - DAY

The next day, scores of REPORTERS are assembled up and down
the steps. There are Television Crews, a number of Radio
Reporters with tape recorders and a number of Print Media
Reporters. They SHOUT and CACKLE as if it were a hanging.

JEFF AND LAWSON

approach the steps and begin to climb. They are surrounded
by the reporters, who question them belligerently Lawson and
Jeff struggle up the steps without responding to the
questions and taunts. Their path is blocked by the turmoil
of Reporters who jostle for position, overlapping each other

1ST REPORTER
(to Lawson)
Dr. King was your close friend. Is
this just a vendetta? Do you still
believe in non-violence?

2ND REPORTER
(overlapping; to Jeff)
Who's paying you? Ray pled guilty.
What's there to argue?

Jeff is pushed and pulled -- he shoves back. Lawson simply
absorbs the blows.

1ST REPORTER
(to Lawson)
Are you helping James Earl Ray?

3RD REPORTER
(to Jeff)
Are you gonna write a book? Why
were you fired by your firm?
124.

1ST REPORTER
Why's your father here? Is he
going to testify against you?

Jeff freezes. So does Lawson. Jeff slowly turns to face the
mob. As he does he is staggered to see a solitary figure at
the top of the steps, staring down.

JEFF'S P.O.V.

Lucas Jenkins stands solemnly at the top of the steps.
ON JEFF

Reacting. Then he and Lawson climb up the steps.
LUCAS'S P.O.V.

Jeff's eyes are riveted on his father. Has he come to
testify against him?

Step by step, Jeff and Lawson keep climbing -- the Reporters
parting before him -- until they stand only one step below
Lucas.

REPORTER #3
The Special Counsel has already
been dismissed. What can you
possibly have to offer?

LUCAS
(to the Press)
Address your questions to me.

REPORTER
(to Lucas)
Who're you?

LUCAS
(a long pause)
I'm Mr. Jeffrey Jenkins' attorney.

JEFF
I don't need you to defend me.

LUCAS
No defense. We're going to press
for the truth.

LAWSON
Good to see you, Lucas.
125.

LUCAS
Good to be seen.

Lawson, Jeff and Lucas make eye contact.

JEFF
(breaking the moment)
Gentlemen -- we have some work that
needs to be done.

Leaving the media circus behind, Lucas, Jeff, and Reverend
Lawson turn, mount the final steps, and enter the House
Office Building.

THEME RISING -- BEGIN CRAWL

The House Select Committee on Assassinations met from January
to June of 1978, and interviewed 4,924 witnesses.

The Committee found that "There was no evidence of complicity
of the FBI, CIA or any Government Agency in the assassination
of Dr. King."

The Committee then sealed, for fifty years, all the
investigative files.

The Congress called upon the Department of Justice to conduct
a thorough investigation into the crime and to inform the
American people of its findings.

The Department of Justice has, to this date, done nothing.
CRAWL ENDS - SCREEN IS BLACK
From out of the BLACK SCREEN, a voice emerges, then a face.
It is Martin Luther King, delivering the now famous
Montgomery, Alabama speech (STOCK)
MARTIN LUTHER KING
"How long? Not long! Because no
lie can live forever! How long?

Not long! Because truth crushed to
earth will rise again!"

The image FREEZES and slowly dissolves.

THE END
