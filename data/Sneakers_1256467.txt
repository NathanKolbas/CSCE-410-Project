December, 1969.

EXT. COLLEGE.  NIGHT.

	Snow falls gently on the grounds.  In the background, a
	dignified eighteenth-century classroom building is
	softly lit by outdoor lights.  A single light, on the
	second floor, is still burning.  The opening credits
	continue to be assembled randomly, sans anagrams.

						MARTY
						(VO)
				Four six nine nine four zero two, transfer
				to five three zero one one three eight.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM.

	The forty-column display is connected to the United
	States Treasury Department, and shows the transaction
	taking place. $25,000.

						COSMO
				What did we just do?

						MARTY
				The Republican party just made a generous
				donation to the Black Panthers.

	The camera pans across the terminal, the dial telephone
	resting in the acoustic coupler modem.

						COSMO
				Far out!

						MARTY
				Right on.

						COSMO
				Who's next?

						MARTY
				Let's see... oooh...

	Marty shuffles through some printouts.

						MARTY
				Richard Nixon's personal chequing account is
				in here.

	The camera continues to pan around the late-sixties
	equipment in the room, looking up to the huge nine-track
	tape drive.  Empty chinese food boxes litter the room -
	something that hasn't changed among hackers in thirty
	years.

						COSMO
						(with slight sarcasm)
				Ooo, this is a challenge.  Marty, we have to
				find somebody truly worthy to give his money
				to.  How about... the National Association
				to Legalize Marijuana.

						MARTY
				Perfect!

						COSMO
				Now, how much should he give?

						MARTY
				He's a generous man.  I'd say... all he's
				got!

						COSMO
				Yeah!

	Cosmo thinks for a split second, and changes his tone.

						COSMO
				Marty, you are sure we will not get into
				trouble for this.

						MARTY
				Cosmo!  Trust me.

EXT. POLICE CAR.  NIGHT.

	Police officers drive slowly through the snow, and
	listen to instructions on the radio.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM.

						COSMO
				Posit.  The Phone Company has too much
				money.

						MARTY
				Oh, good one.

						COSMO
				Consequence.

						MARTY
				Uh, they're corrupt.  Result?

						COSMO
				The system perpetuates itself at the expense
				of the people.  Conclusion?

						MARTY
				Ma Bell needs to donate some money.

						COSMO
				We're going to change the world, Marty.

						MARTY
				I just wish we could get course credit for
				this.

	He gets up.

						MARTY
				Gawsh!  You got it.  You want some food?

	Cosmo swivels around, and holds out a coin.

						COSMO
				Loser goes.

	Cosmo hides the coin in one of his hands, and makes it
	look pretty obvious which one.  He holds out both fists.

						MARTY
				I never lose!

	He indicates Cosmo's left hand.  Cosmo dramatically
	unfolds it, revealing no coin.

	Marty Groans.  Cosmo chuckles.  Marty starts to leave.

						COSMO
				Pepperoni pizza, please.  Shaken, not
				stirred.

						MARTY
				Power to the people, Cos.

						COSMO
				Power to the people, Marty.

	They both make half hearted fist gestures.  Marty exits.

						COSMO
				One cannot trust anybody these days.

EXT. COLLEGE.  NIGHT.

	Marty emerges from the front door and walks off into the
	snowy night.  He climbs into his snow-encrusted
	microbus, but it won't start.

						MARTY
				Don't do this!

	Marty notices the flashing red police lights through the
	snow on his windows.  He rolls down a window and watches
	as police and trenchcoated men pull up and run into the
	building.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM.

	Cosmo is working at the terminal.  He hears a noise.  He
	gets up and walks across to the window.  Marty is down
	below, trying to signal Cosmo but it's too late.  The
	police grab Cosmo and pull him away.

						COSMO
				Marty!  Marty!  Wait!  Wait!

	Cosmo struggles, kicking out a window pane.

	Marty runs off into the night.  The snow turns into
	static on a TV screen.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.  PRESENT DAY (1992).

						CREASE
				Martin?  Martin?

	Donald Crease is trying to wake up a now-older Marty
	Bishop.  He shakes his shoulder.

						CREASE
				Martin?  Martin?

	Bishop wakes up.

						CREASE
				It's time.

						BISHOP
				How are we doing?

						CREASE
				Carl's in position on the fire escape.
				Mother's in the cable vault.  Whistler is
				reading.

	Whistler reads.  In braille.

	A noise sounds.

	Whistler quickly puts away what he was reading.  It's
	the braille edition of Playboy.

						WHISTLER
				We're up!

						BISHOP
				What's with the lobby?

						CREASE
				Still just the one guard.

						WHISTLER
						(into his headset)
				OK, Mother, try the ones coming off the blue
				trunk.

	Bishop looks out the van through binoculars, across the
	street and into a building.  A security guard looks
	around.

	More noises sound.

						WHISTLER
				Mmmm, nope.  Try the ones coming off the
				white trunk, Mother, these don't sound
				right.

	Bishop looks down, to a manhole where Mother is working.

	More tones sound.

EXT. MANHOLE.

						WHISTLER
						(over headset)
				No.

						MOTHER
				They even got photos of the guy leaving the
				embassy through the back service entrance.
				Hey Crease, you on?

INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						CREASE
				Yeah, I'm on.

						MOTHER
				Were you still in CIA in '72?

						CREASE
				Yep, why?

						MOTHER
				Did you know the deputy director of planning
				was down in Managua, Nicaragua the day
				before the earthquake?

						CREASE
						(annoyed)
				Now what are you saying, the CIA caused the
				Managua earthquake?

						MOTHER
				Well, I can't prove it... but...

	Crease hangs up his mic.

						CREASE
				I can't talk to that guy.

	Tones continue to sound.

						WHISTLER
				Hold on, Mother, go back one.

	A tone we just heard sounds again.

						WHISTLER
				Bingo!

EXT. MANHOLE.

						MOTHER
				Securing bridge clips.

	Mother attaches the clips.

						MOTHER
				Preparing to sever master alarm circuit.
				Five... four...

INT. SECURITY STATION.

	A lone security guard is watching television.  A
	security panel in the distance briefly flashes a red
	light, which the guard barely notices before it's
	"green" again.  He goes on watching television.

EXT. STREET.  NIGHT.

	Bishop and Crease leave the van and run across the
	street.  The building is a large bank.  They reach the
	fire escape where Carl is stationed.

						CREASE
				Nice bank.

						BISHOP
				You wouldn't believe what I had to go
				through just to get a safe deposit box.

INT. SAFE DEPOSIT BOX VAULT.

	The camera pans across dozens of boxes.  There is a
	loud, ominous ticking.  Box 589 begins smoking.

INT. SECURITY STATION.

	An alarm sounds.  The security guard is startled and
	knocks the TV off the counter.

INT. FIRE ESCAPE DOOR.

	Carl, Bishop, and Crease enter the building through the
	fire escape.

INT. SECURITY STATION.

	The security guard frantically searches through a
	procedure manual.

INT. BANK FLOOR.

	The three run down through the main customer lobby of
	the bank. Bishop falls trying to jump the counter.
	Crease helps him up.

						BISHOP
				Oh shit!  We're getting too old for this.

INT. SECURITY STATION.

	The security guard gets on the phone.

						SECURITY CHIEF
						(on phone)
				Lifeguard Security.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Yeah, I got a fire at Centurion Bank!

						SECURITY CHIEF
				Yeah, we've got the alarm.  Are there any
				secondary indications?  Smoke, or flame?

	The security guard looks around.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Sm... uh, no.

						SECURITY CHIEF
				Probably a false alarm.  We've been getting
				them in your area all night.  See if it
				resets.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Oh man, I don't know.

INT. BANK ELECTRICAL ROOM.

	The three reach a small room and start looking behind
	panels. They come to one with a lot of wires behind it.

						BISHOP
				You're sure you know which one to cut?

						CARL
				Yes!  The alarm's always the green one.

He cuts a wire.  All the lights go out.

						BISHOP
				Good, Carl.

INT. SECURITY STATION.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Hey, man, I'm not waiting any longer, I'm
				calling the fire...

The alarm abruptly stops.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Oh.  It uh... stopped.  Sorry.

						SECURITY CHIEF
				Hey, no problem.  And, uh, son...

						SECURITY GUARD
				Sir?

INT. SNEAKER VAN.

	The "Security Chief" is actually Whistler, back in the
	van!

						WHISTLER
				Good work.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Thank you, Sir.

	Whistler gets back on the radio.

						WHISTLER
				All yours, Bish.

	Crease is now hacking at a bank terminal.  Bishop looks
	on.

						CREASE
				So.  How much do you want?

INT. BANK.  DAY.

	A teller carefully places ten-thousand dollar wads of
	money in a briefcase.

						TELLER
				Eighty thousand.  Ninety thousand.  One
				hundred thousand.

						BISHOP
				Okay!

						TELLER
				May I ask why you're closing your account
				with us today, sir?

						BISHOP
				Well, I just had this weird feeling that my
				money wasn't safe here anymore.

	Bishop walks off, past a security guard and up the
	stairs and into a boardroom overlooking the bank floor.
	Several executives are waiting for him.  He puts the
	briefcase down on the table and starts dramatically
	slapping ten-thousand dollar wads of money down in front
	of them.

						BISHOP
				Gentlemen, your communication lines are
				vulnerable, your fire exits need to be
				monitored, your rent-a-cops are a tad
				undertrained.  Outside of that everything
				seems to be just fine. You'll be getting our
				full report and analysis in a few days but
				first, who's got my cheque?


A FEW MINUTES LATER.

	A cheque is carefully typed out.

						SECRETARY
				So, people hire you to break into their
				places to make sure no one can break into
				their places?

						BISHOP
				It's a living.

						SECRETARY
				Not a very good one.

	She gives Bishop the cheque.

						BISHOP
				Thank you.

	Bishop leaves with his cheque.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

	Two guys watch Bishop from a parked car.

						GUY
				Is that him?

						OTHER GUY
				Oh yeah.  It's him.

INT. MARTIN BISHOP & ASSOCIATES OFFICES.  DAY.

	Carl hurriedly marches across the room.

						BISHOP
				Who's got the report for the bank sneak?

						MOTHER
				I'm going to type it up later.

						CREASE
				You are?

						MOTHER
				We haven't paid the typist since January, so
				it's either me or Whistler.

						CREASE
				Better Whistler.

						CARL
				We've got customers.

						BISHOP
				Shoes?

						CARL
				Expensive.

						BISHOP
				Look busy, guys.

	Bishop straightens his tie and takes off to the waiting
	room.


INT. WAITING ROOM.

						GORDON
				Mr. Bishop!  Dick Gordon.

	He and Bishop shake hands.

						BISHOP
				Hi!

						GORDON
						(indicating his associate)
				Buddy Wallace.

	Bishop and Wallace shake hands.

						BISHOP
				Hi.

						WALLACE
				Hi.

						GORDON
				We've heard a lot of great things about you.

						BISHOP
				They're all true!

	Gordon laughs.

						BISHOP
				Thanks, Carl.  Uh, gentlemen, why don't we
				go to the conference room, and you can tell
				us how we can help you, huh?

						GORDON
				Good!

	They move to the conference room.  Bishop motions for
	them to have a seat.

						BISHOP
				So, here uh...

						GORDON
				Before we begin, uh, there's something we'd
				like to clear up.

	Bishop closes the door.

						GORDON
				Most firms of this type are staffed with
				ex-law enforcement types, but your team,
				it's, uh...

	Bishop smiles and finishes his sentence.

						BISHOP
				I know... kind of different.

						WALLACE
				Yes, you are.

	Bishop is caught off guard as Wallace finally speaks.

						WALLACE
				Darren Roskow.  Also known as "Mother".

	The camera pans across to Mother working on an
	inspecific piece of equipment.  Wallace continues.

						WALLACE
				Eighteen months at Dannemora for breaking
				and entering.

						BISHOP
				Yeah, he was framed.  He's got the best
				hands in the business.

						WALLACE
				Carl Arbogast.  Age nineteen.  Caught
				breaking into the Oakland City School
				District computer to change his grades.

						BISHOP
				I know!  We're the ones who caught him!

						WALLACE
				Irwin Emery.  Also known as "Whistler."

						BISHOP
				Yeah, yeah, I know.  He had some little
				problem with the phone company.

						WALLACE
				Sixty-two counts?

						BISHOP
				Okay, you want law enforcement?  How about
				Donald Crease?  Twenty-two year veteran of
				the CIA.

						WALLACE
				Terminated!  1987.  Why was that?

						BISHOP
				I don't know, I think maybe a personality
				conflict.  Who are you guys?

						GORDON
				Relax, Marty!  We have to check on these
				things, it's just that everybody on your
				team has had some sort of problem in their
				past.

						WALLACE
				And then there's Martin Bishop.

	An uncomfortably pregnant pause.  Finally Wallace
	reveals an empty file folder.

						WALLACE
				He doesn't seem to have a past.

						BISHOP
				Ah.  Sorry to waste your time, gentlemen.  I
				don't work for the government.

						GORDON
				We know.

	Gordon walks up to Bishop and shows his ID.

						GORDON
				National Security Agency.

						BISHOP
				Ah.  You're the guys I hear breathing on the
				other end of my phone.

						GORDON
				No, that's the FBI.  We're not chartered for
				domestic surveillance.

						BISHOP
				Oh, I see.  You just overthrow governments.
				Set up friendly dictators.

						GORDON
						(smiling)
				No, that's the CIA.  We protect our
				government's communications, we try to break
				the other fella's codes.  We're the good
				guys, Marty.

						BISHOP
				Gee, I can't tell you what a relief that is,
				Dick.

						WALLACE
				All right, that's enough.  Let's go.

	Wallace and Gordon get up to leave.  Wallace leaves
	immediately.

						GORDON
				If you change your mind, call us at this
				number.

	Gordon hands Bishop a wrinkled scrap of paper with a
	number hastily scribbled on it.  He looks Bishop
	straight in the eye.

						GORDON
				Mr. Brice.

	Bishop looks up at him, surprised.  Gordon looks back,
	with a "no shit" look on his face.

	Gordon leaves.  Bishop unfolds the paper.  It's a
	"Wanted" poster for Martin Brice - now Martin Bishop -
	with his picture from 1969.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

	Martin Bishop parks his car and crosses the street.  A
	panhandler gets his attention.


						PANHANDLER
				Spare a quarter?  Help me out?  The
				government's taken away my home.

						BISHOP
						(indicating an election campaign
						poster on the wall behind)
				Talk to him!

	Bishop tosses him a coin.


INT. NSA OFFICE.

						WALLACE
				Well!  If it isn't Robin Hood.

						BISHOP
				You know, I could have joined the NSA.  But
				I found out my parents were married!

	Wallace is visibly upset by this.  Gordon stops him.

						GORDON
				Hey, heyheyhey, we're all friends here,
				alright?  Easy, easy.
						(To Bishop)
				Want some coffee or something?

						BISHOP
				No.

						GORDON
				Buddy, is that Janek's file?

	Wallace puts down a file folder and opens it.

						WALLACE
				Yeah.  Janek's file.

						GORDON
				This is a mathematician, named Dr. Gunter
				Janek. Works at a think tank called the
				Coolidge Institute. Specializes in large
				number theory, prime numbers, factoring.

						BISHOP
				Cryptography.

						GORDON
				Very good!  Last month, the good doctor gets
				a grant, three hundred eighty thousand
				dollars, way out of profile for a guy like
				that.  It's our job to be curious, so we
				traced the money.  Guess where it comes
				from.

						BISHOP
				I know you're not going to say Russia.

						GORDON
				Yeah!

						BISHOP
				Huh.  Give me a break.  We won, they lost,
				you know? It's been in a couple of papers.

						GORDON
				Yeah, we still spy on them, they still spy
				on us.

						WALLACE
				We intercepted a fax last week.  Here.
				They're making some kind of box.
						(He shrugs)
				A little black box.

						GORDON
				The project is called "Setec Astronomy"...
				We don't know what "Setec" stands for...

						BISHOP
				Security Technology...

						GORDON
				Sensor Techniques, who knows.  Anyway it may
				mean nothing, or it may be something, we
				need to know.

						WALLACE
				And your job is to find that little black
				box and let us take a look at it.

						BISHOP
				Yeah.  No way.

						GORDON
				Sorry, Marty, we don't have a lot of choice
				here.

						BISHOP
				Do it yourself.

						WALLACE
				We can't!

						BISHOP
				Why not?

						WALLACE
				By law, we're not allowed or equipped to do
				this kind of operation.

						BISHOP
				Well, then get the FBI.

	Wallace chuckles.

						WALLACE
				Yeah, right.  FBI.

						GORDON
				The FBI can't work for us without approval
				from a congressional oversight committee.

						WALLACE
				We don't have the time.

						BISHOP
				So why me?

						GORDON
				Frankly, because we...

	Bishop cuts him off.

						BISHOP
				Frankly.

						GORDON
				Marty, sit down, please.

	Gordon and Bishop sit.

						GORDON
				Frankly, because it's kind of illegal.
				You've managed to stay underground for more
				than twenty years, that tells us you know
				how not to get caught.

						WALLACE
				We know you can keep your mouth shut.

						GORDON
				The job pays $175,000, payable on delivery.

						WALLACE
				You can... distribute it among the poor if
				you like.

						BISHOP
				Pass.

						GORDON
				We also clean up your record.  Quash the
				outstanding warrant for your arrest.

						WALLACE
				Your pal Cosmo got twelve years.  That was
				without "Flight to evade prosecution."

						GORDON
				We all know what happened to him in there.

	Bishop pauses uneasily.

						BISHOP
				And if I say no?

						WALLACE
				Don't say no.

						GORDON
				What good would you do anybody in prison?


INT. MARTIN BISHOP & ASSOCIATES OFFICES.  EVENING.

						CREASE
				I don't believe this.  You lied to us all
				these years! Even lied to us about your
				name!

						BISHOP
				Sorry, okay?  I'm sorry fellas, I'm sorry,
				but when you're wanted by the feds, you
				don't exactly go around telling everybody
				about it, okay?

						CREASE
				We are not "everybody", Martin, we are your
				partners, you tell us.

						BISHOP
				Fine.  Exactly why was it you had to leave
				the CIA?

	With a foul look on his face, Crease turns his back on
	Bishop.

						BISHOP
				We all have our little secrets, don't we?
				Look, you guys have a decision to make.
				This is not a test, the penetration is live,
				the target is unaware.

						CREASE
				Sneaking a foreign intelligence service that
				might kill us to keep us out is not what we
				do.

						BISHOP
				The probable level of security is very low.
				But if you guys don't want to take that
				chance just to keep me out of jail, fine, I
				understand, I'll do it.

						WHISTLER
				Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other
				guys, but I'm in it for the money, I don't
				care if you go to jail.

						CARL
				Me neither.  I'm in.

						MOTHER
				Uh... could we maybe just go back to the
				"they might kill us" part?

						BISHOP
				Mother, if I thought that was likely to
				happen, I wouldn't bring this to you.  But
				there is a risk!

						WHISTLER
				And it pays $175,000!

						MOTHER
				I'm in.

						CREASE
				You guys will be chalk outlines without me.
				All right, what do we need?

	Crease low-fives Whistler on his way back to the group.

						BISHOP
				All right, we start with a very light
				surveillance, level three, first sign of
				babysitters, we back off.  Now this guy's
				giving a lecture tomorrow at UC, in the
				afternoon, I'm going to be there and
				checking him out.  Okay?  Any questions?

	No one has any questions.

						BISHOP
				Okay, let's do it.

	Everyone gets up and starts to go home.

						CREASE
				For the lecture, do you want to take
				Whistler, or do you want me to go?

						BISHOP
				Uh, no, no, that's okay, I thought I'd ask
				Liz.

	Everyone stops in their tracks and turns around.

	Bishop notices after a few seconds and looks up.


EXT. MUSIC CONSERVATORY.  DAY.

	Piano music plays in the background.  Children file
	across a grass quadrangle.

INT. MUSIC CONSERVATORY.

	Liz is supervising a young student, who is playing
	brilliantly. The girl notices Bishop approaching and
	stops.

						GIRL
				Who's this?

						LIZ
				Sort of an old friend.
						(in a hammy Teutonic accent)
				Practice!  Practice, practice!

	The girl giggles and leaves.

						BISHOP
				Hi.

						LIZ
				We're not getting back together.

						BISHOP
				Did I say anything?

						LIZ
				You will.

						BISHOP
				I'm here on business, Liz.

	She goes around the room and starts collecting music
	from the racks.

						LIZ
				Bishop, you don't have a business.  You have
				a club!  A boy's club.  You have a little
				club house, you probably have a secret
				handshake...

						BISHOP
				Liz, I need your help.

						LIZ
				I will not be dragged back into your world.
				I have a new group of gifted children now
				and I like the fact that they're under
				thirty.  Excuse me.

						BISHOP
				There's a mathematician named Gunter Janek.
				You know him?

	Liz is now shooing Bishop out the door.

						LIZ
				I've read him.  Now go away!

						BISHOP
				Well he's giving a master's lecture at
				3:30... now I...

						LIZ
				How nice for him!

	She shuts the door, with Bishop behind.

	Bishop opens the door and comes back in.

						BISHOP
				I thought I'd buy you dinner after.

						LIZ
				I am not going out with you!

						BISHOP
				This isn't a date, dummy, this is a
				scientific exploration, a tutorial.  I need
				you.

	Liz looks at him doubtfully.

						BISHOP
				To explain it to me.

						LIZ
				Read a book!

	She starts to go.

						BISHOP
				They've found me, Liz.

	She stops in her tracks.

						BISHOP
				The government found me.  They offered me a
				deal.  If I take their offer, they clear my
				record and I can get my name back.

						LIZ
				You and I are not getting back together.

						BISHOP
				Hey, don't flatter yourself!

						LIZ
				Pick me up at 3.

	She leaves.

						BISHOP
				Yes!


INT. LECTURE HALL.

	Gunter Janek is giving his lecture.  He is covered with
	cryptographic and mathematical figures from an overhead
	projector.  He exudes confidence in his subject matter;
	he clearly has a talent for putting on a presentation.

						JANEK
				While the number field sieve is the best
				method currently known, there exists an
				intriguing possibility for a far more
				elegant approach...

	Bishop and Liz watch as he continues his lecture.

						BISHOP
				This guy's good.

						LIZ
				Sh.

						JANEK
				...and hence contained in a single
				cyclotomic field. Using the Arden map, we
				might introduce homomorphisms for the
				principal orders within each of these
				fields...

						BISHOP
				You seeing anybody?

						LIZ
				Sh. This isn't just about large number
				theory, it's about cryptography.

						BISHOP
				Oh.  You mean codes?

						LIZ
				I mean unbreakable codes.

						JANEK
				...It would be a breakthrough of gaussian
				proportions and allow us to acquire the
				solution in a dramatically more efficient
				manner.

						LIZ
				Are you seeing anybody?

						JANEK
				So far, no one has been able to accomplish
				such constructions... yet.


LATER - INT. RECEPTION HALL.  DAY.

	Janek is now discussing his ideas with attendees over a
	buffet table, with all the confidence and showmanship of
	his lecture.

						JANEK
				The numbers are so unbelievably big, that
				all the computers in the world could not
				break them down.  But maybe... just maybe...
				there's a shortcut.

						LIZ
				I'll bet you anything he's found it.  If he
				has, you're in over your head.  I'll get my
				coat.

	She goes to get her coat.  Someone else notices Bishop.

						GREG
				Martin!

	Bishop acknowledges.

						GREG
				Martin, how wonderful to see you!

						BISHOP
				Hi, Greg, how are you.

						GREG
				Is it not fabulous?  Today I can, in public,
				come and learn your scientists' new secrets!
				Alas, I did not understand one bit what he
				was talking about.

	Bishop is visibly distracted, but it's phoney - he's
	trying to get Greg to look the other way.  Greg doesn't,
	and notices Liz.

						GREG
				At least ... Goodness, can it be?
				Elizabeth!

						BISHOP
				Oh yeah, right... she's dying to talk to you
				too, Greg.

						GREG
				Excuse me.  Elizabeth... Elizabeth!

						LIZ
				Hello, Greg!

						GREG
				Elizabeth and Martin.  My heart leaps like
				gazelle to see you back together again.

	Greg helps her with her coat.

						LIZ
				Tell it to stop leaping, we are not back
				together.

						GREG
				Ah. Oh, what a pity.  Wait, I have smashing
				idea.  Martin! Martin!  Kiev String Quartet
				plays at the consulate on thursday night,
				you will be my guests!

						BISHOP
				Really, Greg, I wouldn't know how to repay
				you.

						GREG
				Ha ha.  Martin, now that our countries are
				such good friends, perhaps you will finally
				be able to do occasional favor for me?

						LIZ
				Gregor, you are shameless!

						GREG
				I'll see you thursday night.

	Greg hands Bishop a card - which he's scribbled
	something on.

						BISHOP
				What...

						GREG
				Ah, new title.  Cultural attache.

	The card reads:

			Commonwealth of Independent States
				Consulate General
				Gregor Ivanovich
				Cultural Attache
					(415) 707-4321

						BISHOP
				Unbelievable!

						GREG
				Hmm.  Last few years it's been very
				confusing for people in my line of work.

						BISHOP
				I'll bet.

	Greg excuses himself.

						LIZ
				I don't care what anyone says about the New
				World Order.  I don't trust that guy.

						BISHOP
				Who, Greg?  Ah, he's harmless.

	Bishop notices that a woman is whispering in Janek's
	ear.  He stops playing the crowd in mid-sentence.

						JANEK
				If you'll excuse me, I have some work...

						LIZ
				You're going to follow him, aren't you?

						BISHOP
				Liz, I...

						LIZ
				It's okay.  I'll get a cab.

						BISHOP
				Can I call you?

						LIZ
				Just be careful.

	She leaves.  So does Janek.


EXT. SNEAKER VAN.  NIGHT.

	Bishop walks up to the van, which is on the top floor of
	a parkade across the street from the building the
	sneakers have staked out.  He gets in.

						BISHOP
				Janek just got in the elevator.  Going up.

						CARL
				We will be ready for him.

						BISHOP
				How's the audio?

						WHISTLER
				Good.  Mother's pretty close.

	Through binoculars, Bishop sees Mother on a
	window-washer's platform just under Janek's office.
	Janek enters the office and turns on the lights.

						CREASE
				He's just wearing FOUR safety belts this
				time.

						BISHOP
				What, no parachute?

						CARL
				Alrighty, entry and lights on.

						WHISTLER
				Describe it.

						CARL
				Looks like a work room.  You got yourself a
				bench with a soldering gun, two spools of
				wire and a magnifying lamp.

						WHISTLER
				Huh.  Sounds like they're making something.

						CARL
				And a desk... telephone... lamp... answering
				machine... jar of pencils... but no little
				black box.

						BISHOP
				It's got to be there somewhere, what's he
				doing?

						CARL
				He's logging on the computer.

	Bishop now looks through the camera.

						BISHOP
				Oh, this is good.  He's going to type in his
				password, we're going to get a clear shot.

	A knock on Janek's door.  Janek answers.

						JANEK
				Oh, Dr. Rhyzkov.  Good evening.

						BISHOP
				Let's get an ID on Dr. Rhyzkov.  She was
				with him at the lecture this afternoon and
				she was trying to tell him something...

	Rhyzkov immediately starts making an erotic move on
	Janek... her panting and moaning re-engages the
	attention of the sneakers.

						RHYZKOV
				Oh, Gunter... let's do what we did in Mexico
				City... Oh Gunter...

						BISHOP
				I didn't know you could do THAT in Mexico
				City.

						CARL
				Mr. Bishop, do you mind if I take a look?

						BISHOP
				Carl...

						CREASE
				Grow up!

	Rhyzkov continues loudly panting and moaning.

	Crease taps on Bishop's shoulder and whispers.

						CREASE
				Let me see.

	Bishop grudgingly obliges.

	Janek pushes her away.

						JANEK
				Elena, really!  I must finish my work.

						CREASE
				Okay, back to work.

						BISHOP
				Nope, here we go, now we're going to get our
				password.

	Rhyzkov rubs Janek's shoulders as he types in his
	password, inconveniently blocking the view.

						RHYZKOV
				I leave message here on service but you do
				not call.

						JANEK
				I'm sorry, really.

						BISHOP
				Oh, get out of the way, get ou... she's in
				the way.

	Rhyzkov starts kissing Janek's neck, Janek bends away,
	resisting.

						BISHOP
				I don't believe this.

	Bishop leaves the camera in disgust.  Carl leaps to
	replace him.

						JANEK
				I'm sorry, it's just I have this work...

	Rhyzkov opens her blouse, revealing a legendarily
	well-supported pair.

						RHYZKOV
				I'll give you something to work, baby.

	This is too much for Janek.

						JANEK
				Okay, just for a little while.

	Janek takes off his jacket and they kiss.  She closes
	the blinds.  The blinds crumple as Janek throws her
	against them.

						RHYZKOV
				Oh, Gunter!

						BISHOP
				What's going on?

						CARL
				Oh, nothing.


INT. MARTIN BISHOP & ASSOCIATES OFFICES.

	The scene we just witnessed is now being replayed on
	video.

						MOTHER
				Maybe there's a frame or two where she
				doesn't block it. I'll blow it up.

						BISHOP
				Who's Risekoff?

						CREASE
						(correcting Bishop's
						pronunciation)
				Doctor Elena REESHkov.  Visiting professor
				from Czechoslovakia. Senior research fellow
				in Astrophysics.

						BISHOP
				Bingo.

						CREASE
				Setec Astronomy.  Whatever that is.

	Meanwhile, Mother blows up the video image as best he
	can.  It's a close up of Janek entering his password,
	with Rhyzkov partially in the way.

						MOTHER
				There.

						BISHOP
				W..G..

						CARL
				Looks like the H.

						MOTHER
				Where do you get H?

						CARL
				Right there next to the L.

						BISHOP
				Come on, come on, do it again.

						MOTHER
				H isn't next to the L.

						CARL
				Then J!

						BISHOP
				Guys, do it again!

	Mother rewinds.

						MOTHER
				OK, that's definitely W G.

						CREASE
				Defintely not.  That's a V.

						BISHOP
						(giving up)
				She's in the way.

						WHISTLER
				Fellas, Janek's little black box is on his
				desk between the pencil jar and the lamp.

						MOTHER
				Uh, Whistler, I hate to tell you this, but
				you're blind.

						WHISTLER
				Play the tape back again.

						MOTHER
				You can't even see anything!

						WHISTLER
				Don't look, listen!

	Whistler strikes a tuning fork.

						BISHOP
				Play it back.

						RHYZKOV
						(on tape)
				I leave message here on service but you do
				not...

						BISHOP
				He's got a service.

	They zoom in on the answering machine.

						WHISTLER
				What's he need an answering machine for?

						MOTHER
				There's our little black box.

INT. SNEAKER VAN.  DAY.

	Bishop is being fitted with a hidden microphone and
	earpiece.

						MOTHER
				Okay, boss.  This LTX-71 concealable mic is
				part of the same system that NASA used when
				they faked the Apollo moon landings.  The
				astronauts broadcast around the world from a
				soundstage at Norton Air Force Base in San
				Bernardino, California, so if it worked for
				them, it shouldn't give us too many
				problems.

						BISHOP
				Thanks.


INT. COOLIDGE INSTITUTE LOBBY.

	Carl, posing as a delivery driver, is quietly arguing
	with the desk clerk.  Bishop interrupts.

						BISHOP
				Hey. Did my wife drop the cake off for me?

						CLERK
				Uh, what cake? There's no cake back here.

						BISHOP
				Surprise party for Marsha on the second
				floor.  She was supposed to have dropped a
				cake off.

						CLERK
				I don't know anything about it.

	A horn honks outside.

						BISHOP
				There she is, late as usual.

	Bishop hurries outside.

	The clerk continues arguing with Carl.

						CARL
				Well it states right here very clearly that
				I am to deliver 36 boxes of Liquid Drano to
				this here address.

						CLERK
				Look, I don't care what that says.  If
				you're not on the list, you can't get in.

						CARL
				I might lose my job.

						CLERK
				That's not my problem, kid.

	Bishop returns with a large box and many colorful
	balloons.  He stands at a security gate beside the front
	desk.

						BISHOP
				Could you buzz me in?

	The clerk is too busy arguing with Carl.  He waves
	Bishop off.

						BISHOP
				Hey just buzz it, I can't reach my card.

						CLERK
				Wait one minute...

	The clerk goes on arguing with Carl.

						BISHOP
				Buzz it, okay? We're late for a party on the
				second floor.

	Bishop, getting nowhere, raises his voice.

						BISHOP
				Push the goddamn buzzer, will ya?

	The clerk buzzes Bishop in.  Bishop steps through the
	gate.

						BISHOP
				Thanks.

INT. COOLIDGE INSTITUTE HALLWAYS.

	Bishop emerges from the elevator.  He discards the
	balloons and pulls his briefcase out of the cake box -
	there's no cake.  He reaches Janek's office door.  It
	has a digital keypad lock.

						BISHOP
						(into his hidden microphone)
				Anybody remember how to defeat an electronic
				keypad?

INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						WHISTLER
				Uh oh.

						CREASE
				Don't even joke about that, Martin.  Those
				things are impossible.

						BISHOP
				Think I'm joking?  Looks like they just put
				it in.

						CREASE
				Oh boy!

						MOTHER
				Here, maybe this might help.  An old buddy
				of mine that was in Desert Storm sent it to
				me.  Of course, he was on the other side.

	He hands Crease a manual.

						BISHOP
						(over radio)
				Come on, Crease, there's got to be a way
				around these things!

						CREASE
				All right, all right.  This might work.

INT. COOLIDGE INSTITUTE HALLWAYS.

	Bishop listens carefully to Crease's detailed and
	lengthy instructions.

						BISHOP
				Yeah... yeah... above... yeah... right... uh
				huh... uh huh... yeah... right... yeah...
				Okay.  I'll give it a shot.

	Bishop kicks the door open with one good boot.

						BISHOP
				That worked.

	Bishop enters the office.  He looks out the window to
	see the van parked across the street on the parkade.  He
	goes to the answering machine, and opens it up.  There,
	inside, is the Little Black Box.  He puts the entire
	thing in his briefcase.

						BISHOP
				Got it.

	Suddenly, Dr. Rhyzkov enters the room and turns on the
	lights.

						RHYZKOV
				Gunter?

	She sees Bishop.

						BISHOP
				Oh God, no.  Hi, nice to see you.

						RHYZKOV
				The lab is closed.  Excuse me, I...

	Bishop shuts the door. He grabs her and puts his hand
	over her mouth so she can't scream.  The sneakers her
	her muffled cries over the radio.

INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						CREASE
				What the hell is that?

						MOTHER
				Battle Stations!

						CREASE
				Whistler, monitor the audio.  Grab the mic.

INT. JANEK'S LAB.

						BISHOP
				Okay.  I'm going to remove my hand, now
				please do not scream.  I promise nothing is
				going to happen to you.

	He removes his hand, she runs across the room.

						RHYZKOV
				Who... who are you?

	Bishop doesn't know what to say.

						CREASE
				He's a P.I.

						WHISTLER
						(over radio)
				You're a private investigator.

						BISHOP
				I'm a private investigator.

						RHYZKOV
				But why?  Who hired you?

	Bishop still doesn't have an answer.

						BISHOP
				Huh?

						RHYZKOV
				Who HIRED you?

						BISHOP
				Mrs. Janek.

						RHYZKOV
				There is not Mrs. Janek!

	Crease is becoming exasperated.

						CREASE
				Ugh!

						BISHOP
				Yeah?

						WHISTLER
						(over radio)
				You got us stumped.

						BISHOP
				Oh yeah?  Who do you think paid for your
				little love jaunt to Mexico City?

	Rhyzkov is utterly horrified.

						WHISTLER
						(over radio)
				That was good.

						BISHOP
				Velma.  Velma Janek.  She lives in Montreal
				where she handles her family's real estate
				holdings.  Vast real estate holdings.
				Farms, banks, shopping malls.  Two shopping
				malls. She supports Gunter but figured he
				was cheating on her and that's why she hired
				me.

						RHYZKOV
				Bastard liar!

	She utters a few Czech swearwords and starts for the
	door.

						RHYZKOV
				I'll kill him...

	Bishop stops her.

						BISHOP
				Nonononono, get a hold of yourself, Dr.
				Rhyzkov.  Get a hold of yourself!  Mm mm!
				Now what you gotta do is you gotta not tell
				him you know.

						RHYZKOV
				Ha!

						BISHOP
				No, you weren't here, we didn't talk.  You
				don't know me.  You don't know anything
				about a wife.

						RHYZKOV
				Oh!  You just give me one good reason why!

						BISHOP
				Alright, I'll give you a reason.

	No answer from the sneakers.

						BISHOP
				I'll give you a really good reason.

						CREASE
						(to Whistler)
				It's just what she would want you to do.

						WHISTLER
						(over radio)
				It's just what she would want you to do.

						BISHOP
				It's just what she'd want you to do.

						RHYZKOV
				I don't understand.

						BISHOP
				Yeah, sometimes I don't understand myself.

	He sits her down.

						BISHOP
				Here, look, I might lose my license for
				this.  My client is a vindictive, bitter
				woman.  She's been withholding marital
				favors from Gunter for many many years, and
				now she's out to ruin him.

						WHISTLER
						(over radio)
				And she's using you to get to her.

						BISHOP
				And she's using y... uh, me... to get to
				h... you.  I know that's confusing, but
				don't you see what's happening here, you and
				me, we're just pawns in this ugly little
				game.

						CREASE
						(to Whistler)
				If you love him...

						WHISTLER
						(over radio)
				If you love him...

						BISHOP
				If you love him...

	Bishop looks confused.  Nothing else is coming over the
	radio.

						BISHOP
				If you really love him, then just keep on
				loving him, and never let him know that you
				know what he thinks you don't know, you
				know.  You know?

						WHISTLER
						(over radio)
				And give him head whenever he wants.

	Crease cracks up.

						BISHOP
				And give him he...
						(suddenly getting it)
				help.  Be a beacon in his sad and lonely
				life.  Can you do that for Gunter?

						RHYZKOV
						(sobbing)
				Yes, yes, I can. I can.

						BISHOP
				Okay.  Now get out of here.

	Rhyzkov kisses him on the cheek and leaves, sobbing
	quietly.

						BISHOP
						(over radio)
				Give him head?

						WHISTLER
				Be a beacon?

	They crack up laughing.

INT. MARTIN BISHOP & ASSOCIATES.  NIGHT.

	The offices are lit up as if for Christmas.  The guys
	are partying and celebrating.  Don Crease has brought
	his wife and young daughter.  Liz dances with all the
	sneakers.  Including Whistler.  Except Bishop.  Mother
	is boring Mrs. Crease with one of his conspiracy
	stories.

						MOTHER
				But the key meeting took place July 1, 1958,
				when the Air Force brought the space visitor
				to the White House for an interview with
				President Eisenhower.  And Ike said, hey,
				look, give us your technology, and we'll
				give you all the cow lips you want. So
				that's when...

						CREASE
				Honey, don't listen to this man.  He's
				certifiable.

						MOTHER
				Your husband knows about cattle mutilations,
				he's ex-CIA!

						CREASE
				He's touched!

						MOTHER
				He knows the government's been suppressing
				for years.

	Now at a banquet table, Carl has just finished hearing
	the story of Marty and Cosmo's exploits in the 60's.

						CARL
				One thing I don't get, though, is you and
				Cosmo were taking all these chances, all
				these big chances, I mean, what for?

						BISHOP
				We were young.  And there was a war on.  It
				was a good way to meet girls.

						LIZ
				I'll bet.

						MOTHER
				How come you didn't get caught?

						BISHOP
				I went out for pizza.  Then I went to
				Canada.  I was lucky, he wasn't.

						WHISTLER
				Did he ever forgive you?

						BISHOP
				I hope so.  He died in prison.

	A somber silence.

						BISHOP
				So, what are you guys going to do with your
				share of the money? Don?

						CREASE
				Well, we have never been to Europe,
				together, and we are going.  Madrid,
				Lisbon...

						MRS. CREASE
				Athens, oh and Scotland...

						CREASE
				And Tahiti..

						MRS. CREASE
				Oh, yes!

						BISHOP
				Mother?

						MOTHER
				Well, you know, I've never actually had a
				really cool car that I could fit comfortably
				into.  So I think I'm going to buy me a
				Winnebago.  With a big kitchen...
				waterbed... big kitchen...

						BISHOP
				Carl?

	Carl has been inhaling helium.

						CARL
						(in helium voice)
				I'd like to have a deep relationship with a
				beautiful woman who melts from the very
				first time our eyes meet.

	Everyone laughs.

						BISHOP
				We're not getting paid that much, Carl.

						CARL
				Well you know, someone like Liz.

						BISHOP
				You're definitely not getting paid that
				much.

	Everyone oooohs.

						MRS. CREASE
				Uh oh.

	Liz just taps Bishop.

						BISHOP
				Whistler?

						WHISTLER
				Uh, peace on earth, good will toward men.

						MOTHER
				Right on.

						WHISTLER
						(indicating Crease's daughter)
				And women.

						BISHOP
				Hear hear.


LATER.

	Some of the sneakers are playing Scrabble.  Bishop adds
	"S" and "Y" to "CRUNCH".

						LIZ
				That's not a word!

						BISHOP
				Yes it is.

						LIZ
				Scrunchy.

						BISHOP
				Yeah!

						LIZ
				Scrunchy's not a word.  Scrunchy is not a
				word.

						BISHOP
						(in unison with Liz)
				Scrunchy.  Scrunchy is a word.

						LIZ
				Since when?

						BISHOP
				You know what happens to your face?

						LIZ
				Oh, please.  It's not a word!

						BISHOP
				Right now your face is scrunchy.  You are
				scrunchy, so that is a word.

						CREASE
				All right, we're gonna take it as a word for
				the time being...

	Meanwhile, Whistler is examining (as best a blind person
	can) the little black box.

						WHISTLER
				Carl!

						CARL
				Yes?

						WHISTLER
				What does it say where this is?

						CARL
				Hold on a second here.

	Carl turns on a magnifying lamp.

						CARL
				"System Out."

	Crease notices what they are doing.

						CREASE
				Guys, I really think you should leave that
				thing alone.

						WHISTLER
				Yeah, I know.  I just wanted to see
				something, don't worry, Don.
						(To Carl)
				How do you spell Setec?

						CARL
				S.E.T.E.C.  Setec.
						(he thinks)
				Special... Extraterrestrial?

						WHISTLER
				Earthling Counter.

						CARL
				Boo!

	Meanwhile, Liz is telling a story over the Scrabble
	game, and Bishop is pondering over the letters.
	Apparently it's his turn.

						BISHOP
				Setec...

						LIZ
				What?

						BISHOP
				Setec Astronomy.

						LIZ
				I just love it when a man says that to me.

						BISHOP
				Setec doesn't mean anything.  Excuse me.

	He pours the scrabble pieces onto the table and puts
	aside the board.  He forms the words "SETEC ASTRONOMY"
	from scrabble pieces.  Then he starts making anagrams
	from those letters.

	Meanwhile, Carl and Whistler are poring intently over
	the Little Black Box.

						WHISTLER
				Hmm.  Carl... get me some cable... and an
				I/O interface please.

	Carl obliges.  Meanwhile, Bishop has come up with the
	anagram: MONTEREYS COAST

						BISHOP
				Montereys Coast.  Does Montereys Coast mean
				anything, you guys?

						CARL
				No.

						WHISTLER
				No.

	Whistler keeps working.

						WHISTLER
				Carl.... get the diagnostics.

	Liz and Bishop find another: MY SOCRATES NOTE.

						LIZ
				How about "My Socrates Note?"

						CARL
				No.

						MOTHER
				Uh-uh.

	They find another: COOTYS RAT SEMEN

						BISHOP
				No, I...

						LIZ
				No.  No.

	Mother probes different parts of the little black box
	with a test probe, and Whistler's Braille Terminal gives
	him a rapid readout.

						WHISTLER
				Uh huh.  Got it.  Move to another one.

	The scrabble letters start resolving into: TOO

						WHISTLER
				Mmm hmm.  Give me another one.

	Whistler's Braille Terminal rattles away.

						WHISTLER
				Stay in that quadrant.

	The scrabble letters now say TOO MANY

						WHISTLER
				It's kind of like the same thing.  Try
				another quadrant.

	Something comes up on the monitor.

						WHISTLER
				Whoa.  What was that?  Go back
				one.

						MOTHER
				All right.

	The monitor fills with data.

						WHISTLER
				Holy cow!  What the hell is this?

	Data streams across the screen.

	Now the scrabble letters say, TOO MANY SECRETS

						BISHOP
				Too many secrets.

						WHISTLER
				Bish, I think you'd better come over here.
				Carl, you got your little black book?

						CARL
				Yes.

						WHISTLER
				Give me the number for something impossible
				to access.

						CARL
				What about this: Federal Reserve Transfer
				Node, Culpepper Virginia.

						MOTHER
				Yeah, sure, good luck.

						CARL
				900 billion a day go through there.

						WHISTLER
				That'll do.  Punch it in.

						CARL
				Okay.  You won't get in.  It's encrypted.

	Encrypted text fills the screen.

						CARL
				See?

						WHISTLER
				Mother, that last contact.

	The encrypted text slowly resolves into plain text.

						WHISTLER
				Look at this, boys.  Anybody want to shut
				down the Federal Reserve?

						CREASE
				Hey, hey hey, don't screw around with that
				thing. You...

	Bishop stops him.

						WHISTLER
				What else have you got?

						CARL
				The national power grid.

	Whistler chuckles.

						CARL
				Okay!

						WHISTLER
				Here we come... Mother?

						MOTHER
				Probing.

	This time a power grid map of the northeastern United
	States appears.

						MOTHER
				Wow... unbelievable!

						WHISTLER
				Anybody want to black out New England?
				Carl, what else?

						CARL
				Air Traffic Control System.

						WHISTLER
				Hmm.

	The scrambled data comes back.

						WHISTLER
				Okay, Mother.

	Mother probes the box.  An Air Traffic Control map of
	the Bay Area comes up.

						LIZ
				Oh my God.

						CREASE
				How is this possible?

						WHISTLER
				Crytpography systems are based on
				mathematical problems so complex they cannot
				be solved without a key.

						LIZ
				Janek must have figured out a way to solve
				those problems without the key, and he hard
				wired it into that chip.

						CREASE
				Turn it off.

						WHISTLER
				Anybody want to crash a couple of passenger
				jets?

						CREASE
				I said turn it off!

						BISHOP
				Turn it off!

	Bishop turns it off.

						CARL
				So it's a code breaker.

						BISHOP
				No.  It's THE code breaker.  No more
				secrets.

						CREASE
				Honey, you and Melissa get your things.

A MINUTE LATER.

	Crease shows his wife and sleeping child to the door.

						MRS. CREASE
				Night-night.

						CREASE
				Night-night.

	He shuts the door behind them.

						CREASE
				What time is the handoff?

						BISHOP
				Nine.  AM.

						CREASE
				Well, between now and then we are going to
				institute some security around here.

	Crease looks for his long-disused sidearm.  He straps it
	on.

						LIZ
				Ooo oo oo, this is where I get off.  Nice to
				see you again, guys.  I'm out of here.

	She starts to leave, but Crease stops her.

						CREASE
				Don't take this personally, Liz, but you
				were the only one who knew Martin's secret,
				and somebody talked.  So make yourself
				comfortable, we're all staying right here
				tonight.

						LIZ
						(in her most forcefully calm
						cadence)
				No.  I'm getting my bag. And I'm leaving.
				So relax, Crease.

	Crease stops her again.

						CREASE
				I'll relax when we get that damn thing out
				of here. Until then, you stay.

						BISHOP
				What?

						CREASE
						(to Bishop)
				There isn't a government on this planet that
				wouldn't kill us all for that thing.

	Bishop gets up and walks over to Liz to break the bad
	news to her.

						BISHOP
				Sorry.

						LIZ
				I see.

						BISHOP
				Carl?  Hit the alarm.  Whistler, let's
				unplug that thing.

						CREASE
						(over Bishop)
				Mother, lock everything down.  Doors and
				windows.  Then kill the lights.

						MOTHER
				You bet.

						LIZ
				Thank you for the trust, fellows.

	Time passes.  Bishop paces.  Crease loads his revolver.
	The others sleep.  Fade to black.


INT. MARTIN BISHOP & ASSOCIATES OFFICES.  THE NEXT MORNING.

						LIZ
				I really enjoyed sleeping with all you guys.
				Take care.

	The guys all say goodbye.  Bishop helps her with her
	coat.

						LIZ
				I hope the handoff goes well.  I'd hate for
				you to have something new to run from.

	She leaves.

						CREASE
				Martin?  It's time.

						BISHOP
				Yeah.

	He packs up the box.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

	Bishop parks his car on a street by the Bay, in the
	shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Wallace and Gordon
	are waiting for him at a sidewalk cafe table.  Crease
	waits at the car.

						GORDON
				'Morning!

						BISHOP
				Hi.

						GORDON
				Any problems?

						BISHOP
				Nope.

						GORDON
				Want a cappucino?

						BISHOP
				No.

	Bishop hands over the box.  Gordon and Wallace look
	inside. Gordon smiles broadly.

	Meanwhile, Crease notices something on the front
	page of the newspaper:

	MATHEMATICIAN KILLED.  MURDER, ARSON SUSPECTED.

	The face in the picture is Janek's.  Crease realizes
	something horrible.  Ominous music starts.

						GORDON
				Got his cheque?

	Wallace opens a briefcase.

						CREASE
						(from the car)
				Hey, Martin!  Telephone!

	He waves a cellphone dramatically.

						BISHOP
				Just a minute!

						CREASE
				It's your MOTHER.

	Bishop looks back at Gordon and Wallace, whose smiles
	have disappeared.

						BISHOP
				She's, uh... she's old.  Excuse me.

	He goes back to the car without the box or any cheque.

						CREASE
				Get in the car.

						BISHOP
				What?

						CREASE
						(emphatically)
				Get in the car!

						BISHOP
				I didn't get the money!

	Gordon starts after him.

						CREASE
				Now!

	They get in the car and drive off like a shot.

						BISHOP
				What the hell are you doing?  I didn't get
				the money!

						CREASE
				Janek's dead.

						BISHOP
				They killed him!

						CREASE
				The NSA doesn't kill people, Martin.   Who
				are they?

						BISHOP
				You said it last night, there isn't a
				government on earth that wouldn't kill for
				that thing.

						CREASE
				Not ours!  Who were those guys?

						BISHOP
				There's one way to find out.

	He hangs a star-wars left turn, cutting off another
	driver. They arrive at the building where Wallace and
	Gordon's office was.  "Was" being the proper word: it
	has been demolished.

	A panhandler approaches the car, cup held out.

						PANHANDLER
				They took away my home.  Help me out?  The
				government took away my home.

						BISHOP
				My God!

INT. MARTIN BISHOP & ASSOCIATES OFFICES.  RAINING.

	Bishop looks dejectedly out the window to the rainy
	city. Behind him, Crease paces busily.  He's on the
	phone.

						CREASE
				Don't tell me you can't do it, because I
				know you can. And don't tell me you won't do
				it because I've got to have it. Damnit, I
				need to know!  And I need to know now!

						MOTHER
				Hey, guys, interesting.  That federal
				building?  It's been scheduled for
				demolition since August.  It housed the
				Federal Trade Commission and the Department
				of Agriculture. It's been vacant for a
				month.

						CARL
				The NSA never had an office in San
				Francisco!  Their West Coast operations are
				run out of Los Angeles!

						CREASE
				Oh God.  Yeah, thanks.
						(he clicks the phone off)
				Janek's grant is from the NSA.

	He throws the phone across the room and bears down on
	Bishop.

						CREASE
				How could you be so goddamned stupid?  Two
				guys show up, say they're government and you
				just buy it.

						WHISTLER
				They probably were government.  Just not
				ours.

	Bishop looks at the card Greg gave him after the lecture
	and ponders whether to call him.

						BISHOP
				Everybody pack up whatever you can.  This
				place isn't safe.

	Bishop goes to his desk and gets a 38 special.

						CREASE
				What do you think you're doing?

						BISHOP
				I'm going to a concert.


INT. C.I.S. CONSULATE.

	The string quartet plays masterfully to an intimate,
	formally dressed audience. Greg has a lovely young date
	with him.  Bishop sneaks up behind Greg and pokes the
	revolver into his shoulder.

						BISHOP
						(whispering)
				Keep smiling.

						GREG
				Martin, have you lost your mind?

						BISHOP
				Excuse yourself.

						GREG
						(to his date)
				My darling, would you excuse me for a
				moment?

	They leave.

INT. UNDERGROUND SWIMMING POOL.

						BISHOP
				Give me back Janek's box, Greg.

						GREG
				Martin, I don't have it.  Now, you must
				believe me.

						BISHOP
				No. You used me, you set me up, Greg, no I
				do not believe you.

						GREG
				We had nothing to do with this Janek
				business.  Not for lack of trying, mind you.
				Your codes are entirely different from ours.
				We've never had any luck in breaking them.
				So Lord knows I wanted that box.  But we
				didn't take it.

	Bishop puts the gun away.

						BISHOP
				Then who did?

						GREG
				What I will tell you now I cannot tell you
				in this building.  Do you understand?  Come.

	He starts back up the stairs.  Bishop doesn't.

						GREG
				Martin.  You must trust me.



INT. LIMOUSINE.

	Greg is showing Bishop a spy scrapbook.

						GREG
				Him?

						BISHOP
				No.

	Greg flips the page.

						GREG
				Him?

						BISHOP
				No.

	Greg says something in Russian to his driver and flips
	again.

						GREG
				Him?

						BISHOP
				No.

	Greg puts the book away.

						GREG
				I am afraid these books are not as current
				as they used to be.

						BISHOP
				You guys still keep tabs on all our agents,
				huh?

						GREG
				These are just the ones we thought we could
				turn.  You know, sexual problems...
				financial troubles...  then we had financial
				troubles.

	By now Greg is flipping through another book.  Bishop
	stops him.

						BISHOP
				That's him.  The older guy.

	The picture is a clear profile of Buddy Wallace.

						GREG
				A loathsome man named Buddy DeVries.  A.K.A.
				Buddy Weber, Buddy Wallace...

						BISHOP
				Wallace.  That's him.

						GREG
				Hm.  We tried to recruit him in '83.
				Drinking problem, married three times.  Left
				the NSA four years ago...  Oh my.

	Greg abruptly slams the book closed.  He is as white as
	a sheet.

						BISHOP
				What?

	Greg just looks grim.

						GREG
				You disappeared once before, my friend.  I
				suggest you do it again.

						BISHOP
				Why?  Who's he working for?

	A police siren sounds behind them.

						GREG
				Your FBI is such a pain in the ass.

	He says something in Russian to the driver.

						BISHOP
				Who's he working for?

	The car pulls over.

						GREG
				Martin, I can offer you asylum inside this
				car. Technically it's part of the consulate.
				Do you wish our protection?

						BISHOP
				What?  Who is Wallace working for?

	Someone taps on the window.  It rolls down.

						FBI AGENT
				Mr. Bishop?  My name is Special Agent
				Vestrop, FBI. Please, step out of the
				vehicle.

						GREG
				Do you wish our protection?

						FBI AGENT
				Mr. Bishop, get out of the vehicle now.

	Bishop starts to get out.

						GREG
				You won't know who to trust.

	Bishop exits the car.  It turns out that they are in a
	tunnel.

						2nd FBI AGENT
				Mr. Bishop, step over here please.
				Hands on the wall, sir.

	Bishop complies.  The agent frisks him, and finds
	Bishop's handgun.  We notice that the agent is wearing
	gloves...

						FBI AGENT
				Is this loaded?

						BISHOP
				Yes.

	The agent puts on a glove, takes Bishop's gun from the
	other agent, aims it into the car, and executes Greg.
	Greg's driver gets out of the car and runs for it, and
	he is shot in the back. He slowly turns around and
	carefully leaves the weapon on the ground.

						FBI AGENT
				Too many secrets!

	Buddy Wallace emerges from the "FBI" car and knocks
	Bishop unconscious with a single blow.  Fade to black.



INT. AUTO TRUNK.
(Trivia nuts: the car's license plate is California 2EAK042)

	Bishop regains consciousness in the trunk of a car.  A
	recurring noise is heard.  He strikes a match so he can
	see.  He squirms around to no avail.  He hears other
	noises and just lies there. Finally the car stops, and
	someone gets out.  The trunk opens, and Buddy Wallace is
	shining a flashlight in Bishop's face.

						BISHOP
				Oh, shit.

						WALLACE
				What are you doing up?

	Wallace knocks him out again.


INT. COSMO'S OFFICE.

	Bishop regains consciousness in an ultra-modern,
	well-appointed office suite.  With an aquarium full of
	exotic fish, and a Cray supercomputer Cosmo is waiting
	in the shadows.

						COSMO
				Pain?

						BISHOP
				Yeah.

	Cosmo steps out of the shadows, so that his features can
	be discerned.

						COSMO
				Try aspirin.

	Cosmo offers him a small jar of pills.

	He hides the jar in one of his hands, in the same
	magician's style that he hid that coin all those years
	ago.

						BISHOP
				Cosmo!

	Cosmo reveals the jar.

						COSMO
				I'm sorry if he hurt you.  I'm afraid
				Wallace doesn't like you very much.

						BISHOP
				Yeah.  You ought to have that guy checked
				for rabies.

						COSMO
				Rabies occurs only in warm-blooded animals.
				Anyway, I couldn't have you talking to the
				Russians.  Five years ago, yes, we could
				trust them not to go running to the FBI, or
				if they did, we could trust the FBI not to
				believe them; today... we can't trust
				anybody.

						BISHOP
				What the hell's going on here?  Cosmo,
				what... what happened?

						COSMO
				The world changed on us, Marty.  And without
				our help.

						BISHOP
				What happened?

	Cosmo smiles and motions to get up.  Both do.

						COSMO
				There I was in prison, and, one day I help a
				couple of nice older gentlemen make some
				free telephone calls. They turn out to be...
				let us say "good family men".

						BISHOP
				Organized crime?

						COSMO
				Heh.  Don't kid yourself.  It's not that
				organized. Anyway, they arranged for me to
				get an early release from my "unfortunate
				incarceration" and I began to perform a
				variety of services.

	Cosmo turns on a large monitor.

						COSMO
						(continuing)
				For starters, I re-organized their entire
				financial operation.  Budgets, payroll,
				money laundering, you name it.

	Cosmo demonstrates with a computer spreadsheet.

						COSMO
						(continuing)
				And the whole network is protected by a very
				powerful encryption system, so the
				government cannot read it.

						BISHOP
				But if the feds get Janek's box...

	Cosmo switches off the screen.

						COSMO
				Disaster!  Therefore, we must have it.

						BISHOP
				To protect the organization.

						COSMO
						(hesitantly)
				Yes.

						BISHOP
				No.  I don't buy it.  I know you.

	Cosmo grins.

						COSMO
				God, it's good to see you.

	Cosmo silently puts his finger to his mouth, "Shhh", and
	looks to the cieling.  He motions Bishop toward the Cray
	supercomputer's air-conditioned glass compartment.

	As they walk over to the Cray, Cosmo starts whispering.

						COSMO
				Remember how to change the world, Marty?
				Remember?  Did you ever get around to
				actually doing it?  No?  I guess not. Well,
				I think I can.

	They enter the Cray compartment.

						BISHOP
				Really?

						COSMO
				Yes.

	Cosmo continues aloud.

						COSMO
				What's wrong with this country, Marty?

	Bishop just looks dumb.  Both men sit down on the Cray's
	padded "seat".

						COSMO
				Money.  You taught me that.  Evil defense
				contractors had it, noble causes did not.
				Politicians are bought and sold like so much
				chattel.  Our problems multiply.  Pollution,
				crime, drugs, poverty, disease, hunger,
				despair; we throw gobs of money at them!
				The problems always get worse.  Why is that?
				Because money's most powerful ability is to
				allow bad people to continue doing bad
				things at the expense of those who don't
				have it.

						BISHOP
				I agree.  Now who did you say you were
				working for?

						COSMO
				Oh, that's just my day job.  Listen, when I
				was in prison, I learned that everything in
				this world, including money, operates not on
				reality...

						BISHOP
				...but the perception of reality.

	Cosmo smiles broadly, sensing the old college banter
	coming back.

						COSMO
				Posit.  People think a bank might be
				financially shaky.

						BISHOP
				Consequence.  People start to withdraw their
				money.

						COSMO
				Result.  Pretty soon it IS financially
				shaky.

						BISHOP
				Conclusion.  You can make banks fail.

						COSMO
				Bzzzt!  I've already done that.  Maybe
				you've read about a few?

	Bishop puts on a "no shit?" look.

						COSMO
				Think bigger.

						BISHOP
				Stock market?

						COSMO
				Yes.

						BISHOP
				Currency market.

						COSMO
				Yes.

						BISHOP
				Commodities market.

						COSMO
				Yes.

						BISHOP
				Small countries?

	Cosmo nods.

						COSMO
				I might even be able to crash the whole
				damned system. Destroy all records of
				ownership.  Think of it, Marty.  No more
				rich people, no more poor people, everbody's
				the same, isn't that what we said we always
				wanted?

						BISHOP
				Cos, you haven't gone crazy on me, have you?

						COSMO
				Who else is going to change the world,
				Marty? Greenpeace?

	Bishop laughs.

						BISHOP
				You ARE crazy!

	A disappointed Cosmo briskly leaves the compartment.

						COSMO
				Tomorrow, they will retrieve your
				fingerprints from the gun that killed the
				Russian consular officer.  The following
				day, those prints will be run through an FBI
				computer.

	Cosmo taps on a keyboard.

						COSMO
				They will come up with a name.

	Cosmo starts entering Bishop's real name, Martin Brice,
	into an FBI computer record.

						COSMO
				Martin Brice!  My old and good friend who
				promised me we would not get in trouble and
				who I might add, did not.  And then they
				will check this database in Washington,
				D.C., which I'm now able to access, thanks
				to you.

	Now a screenful of random junk resolves into a login
	screen.

						COSMO
						(continuing)
				Of course, no one knows where Martin Brice
				is, today.  But what if this indicated an
				alias?

	Cosmo types "Martin Bishop" into a "Known Aliases:"
	field, overtyping "None".

	Bishop is shaken.

						BISHOP
				Don't... don't do it, Cos.

						COSMO
				Pain?

	Bishop nods.

						COSMO
				Try prison.

	Cosmo hits "Enter" and then "Information Updated"
	appears in red on the screen.

	Bishop slumps.

						COSMO
				Ciao.

	Buddy Wallace comes up behind Bishop.

						BISHOP
				Oh no, not the head.

	Dick Gordon is now also behind Bishop.

						GORDON
				Just relax.

	Gordon puts Bishop in a headlock.

						COSMO
				No more secrets, Marty.


EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET.  DAWN.

	It's dawn atop one of San Francisco's famous slopes.
	Alcatraz Island lies in the distance.  A black car
	crests the hill and screeches to a halt.  Martin Bishop
	is thrown, half conscious, onto the street, and then the
	car takes off.  He painfully gets up, finds his
	bearings, and walks away.



INT. APARTMENT BUILDING.

	Bishop knocks on the door of apartment 4B.


INT. LIZ'S APARTMENT.

	Liz, wearing a bathrobe, answers the door.  She gasps at
	Bishop's condition.

						BISHOP
				I've had a bad night.

						LIZ
				Really.  You look terrific.

						BISHOP
				You look awful.

	Liz, who is not wearing any makeup and looks like she's
	just gotten out of bed, nevertheless looks stunning as
	always.

						LIZ
				Well, I should think so, considering what
				I've been through.

						BISHOP
				What happened?

						LIZ
				You tell me.

	They go to her bathroom.

						BISHOP
				Oh, you got hit over the head twice and got
				thrown out of a speeding car?

						LIZ
				No.  Here, let me do this.

	She cleans up the cut to his head.  It stings.

						BISHOP
				I'm sorry.

						LIZ
				It's okay.  I understand.

	Bishop looks her in the eye.

						BISHOP
				I'm sorry.

	They embrace mournfully.

						LIZ
				The paper said that Greg was killed.  I
				called your number and someone else
				answered.  I didn't recognize the voice.

						BISHOP
				I can't do this alone, Liz.

						LIZ
				I'm here.

	Bishop makes a phone call.

						BISHOP
						(into phone)
				We have to meet.


LIZ'S APARTMENT.  LATER.

	A television news show goes in-depth about Greg's
	murder.

						ANCHOR
				The FBI says the fingerprints found in the
				embassy car match those taken from the
				office of a government researcher found
				murdered earlier this week in Palo Alto.
				The connection was made after a Bay Area
				radio station received an anonymous tip
				linking the two killings.

						BISHOP
				Yeah, I'll bet it was anonymous.

	He turns off the TV.

						BISHOP
				Son of a bitch!

						CREASE
				All right, it's time we call the
				authorities.

						MOTHER
				Oh yeah.  Great.  Now that we're accessories
				to espionage and murder.

						CREASE
				All the more reason to turn ourselves in
				now, while we can still cut a deal!

						MOTHER
				With what? We got bupkus! We turn ourselves
				in now, they'll give us twenty years in the
				electric chair!

						CREASE
				You think I like it?  Goddamnit, I've got a
				family!  But we have no other choice.

						BISHOP
				Yes, we do.  We make the call, but we make
				it our way. Unload the van.


A FEW MINUTES LATER.

	The sneakers are turning Liz's apartment into an
	electronic command center.  She meekly holds the door.

						CARL
				Thanks.  Nice apartment.


A FEW MORE MINUTES LATER.

	A map of the world is displayed on a computer screen.
	Lines start forming between different points.

						WHISTLER
				I'm going to bounce this call through nine
				different relay stations throughout the
				world and off two satellites. It'll be the
				hardest trace they've ever heard.

	Mother proudly shows off an impressive-looking pen
	register machine.

						MOTHER
				This'll measure stress in the voice of the
				person on the other end of the line.  Not as
				accurate as a polygraph, but for today's
				purposes it'll do.

	It becomes apparent that we've seen Whistler and
	Mother's little presentations through Liz's eyes.

						LIZ
				Unbelievable.

						BISHOP
				Let's do it.

	Bishop places Liz's phone handset in an acoustic coupler
	and dials.

						OPERATOR
				Fort Meade, Maryland.  Good afternoon.

						CREASE
						(whispering)
				Try director of ops.

						BISHOP
				Uhm, National Security Agency, director of
				operations please.

						OPERATOR
				What extension, please?

						BISHOP
				Uhm, sorry, I forget the number.  Uh, could
				I please have director of operations?  It's
				very important.

						OPERATOR
				What extension, please?

						CREASE
						(whispering)
				Try research.

						BISHOP
				Give me research.  It's an emergency.

						OPERATOR
				I need an extension or a name.

						BISHOP
				Setec Astronomy.

	The operator is silent for a few seconds.  Her tone of
	voice changes dramatically.

						OPERATOR
				One moment, please.

	A link on Whistler's phone connection display blinks.
	Weird noises in his headset signal him.

						WHISTLER
				They've started the trace.

	A deep-voiced man comes on the line.

						ABBOTT
						(on phone)
				Who is this, please?

						BISHOP
				It's my dime, I'll ask the questions.  Who
				are you?

						ABBOTT
				Well, let's say my name is... Mr. Abbott.

	Mother's lie-detecting pen register wavers a little.

						MOTHER
						(whispering)
				True.

						WHISTLER
				They've made the second leg!

	Another link on Whistler's display blinks.

						BISHOP
				Mr. Abbott, are you interested in Setec
				Astronomy?

						ABBOTT
				I'm interested in all kinds of astronomy.

	Mother's pen register wiggles a little bit.

						MOTHER
						(nodding)
				Yup.

						BISHOP
				Cute.

						WHISTLER
				They've got the satellite and Tokyo.  These
				guys are good!

						BISHOP
				I need to know if you're someone who can
				make a deal.

						ABBOTT
				Go on.

						BISHOP
				Can you deal?

						ABBOTT
				Yes!

						MOTHER and CARL
						(in unison)
				True.

	Another link on Whistler's display blinks.

						WHISTLER
				They're across Transcom, you've got about
				twenty seconds, Bish!

						BISHOP
				If I come in with what I know, can you
				guarantee my safety?

						ABBOTT
				Do you have the item?

	Crease shakes his head and mouths "No."

						BISHOP
				No.

						WHISTLER
				Fifteen seconds!

						BISHOP
				Can you guarantee my safety?

						ABBOTT
				Where is the item?

						BISHOP
				Can you guarantee my safety?

						WHISTLER
				Five seconds!

						ABBOTT
				Yes, I can guarantee your safety.

	The pen register goes crazy.

						MOTHER
				Bish, he's lying!

						WHISTLER
				Hang up, they've almost got us!

						MOTHER
						(excitedly)
				He's lying!

						WHISTLER
				Hang up, Bish!

						MOTHER
				He's lying, he's lying!

						WHISTLER
				Hang up!

	Whistler gets up and blindy fumbles across the room.

						MOTHER
				There's got to be a way to cut a deal with
				those guys.

						CREASE
				Too late.  If we had the box, yes.  Without
				it, no.

						CARL
				So let's get this fricking thing!

						BISHOP
				I don't know where it is, remember?

						WHISTLER
				What did it sound like?

						MOTHER
				You've no idea at all where they took you?

						BISHOP
				No!  They threw me in a trunk, drove around
				in circles. It could be a hundred miles
				away, it could be next door, it could be
				underground, it could be in a skyrise.
				Forget it!

						WHISTLER
				Bish, what did it sound like?

						BISHOP
				What?

						WHISTLER
				The road.  When you were in the trunk, what
				did the road sound like?

						BISHOP
				Well, I don't.... highway, a regular
				highway.

						WHISTLER
				Well, did you go over any speedbumps?
				Gravel?  How about a bridge?

						BISHOP
				Bridge.  Yeah.

						MOTHER
				Four bridges in the Bay Area.

						WHISTLER
				Was the Golden Gate fogged in last night?

						CREASE
				Yes.

						WHISTLER
				Did you hear a foghorn?

						BISHOP
				No.

						CREASE
				Scratch the Golden Gate.

						CARL
				That leaves three.

						WHISTLER
				What did it sound like?  Did you go through
				a tunnel in the middle?

						BISHOP
				I'm not... no.

						CREASE
				Scratch the Bay.

						CARL
				Well that leaves two.

						MOTHER
				San Mateo and Dunbarton.

						WHISTLER
				What did it sound like?

	Whistler, by now, has set up a musical synthesizer and
	is making noises with it.

						BISHOP
				Lower.

	Whistler lowers the pitch of the noise a couple of
	notches.

						BISHOP
				Lower.

	Whistler lowers the noise again.

						BISHOP
				There was a recurring sound.

						WHISTLER
				Like seams in the concrete.

	Whistler adds a recurring thumping to the noise.

						BISHOP
				But further apart.

	Whistler slows the thumping.

	Bishop's eyes light up.

						BISHOP
				Yeah.


EXT. BRIDGE.  DAY.

	The sneakers' van drives across a very long concrete
	bridge. The tire noises sound almost exactly like the
	noises Whistler synthesized earlier.


INT. VAN.

						MOTHER
						(yelling from driver's seat)
				Now what?

						BISHOP
				Bumps.  Rough ones.

						CREASE
				Railroad tracks.

						CARL
						(reading map)
				Yeah, a right on Anthrem and a left on
				eighty-four.

						WHISTLER
				And then what did you hear?

						BISHOP
				A cocktail party.

						CARL
				What?

						BISHOP
				We drove through what sounded... it sounded
				like a...
						(realizing how dumb it sounds)
				cocktail party.  It was a chattering.  It
				was right at the end.

						CREASE
				Great.  Now we gotta look for a cocktail
				party on the other side of the railroad
				track.

						WHISTLER
				Wait, Carl, what's the exit where the
				railroad tracks are?

						CARL
				Crescent!

						WHISTLER
				Well then stay on Crescent, get off at the
				reservoir.

						MOTHER
				Okay!

						CREASE
				There's a cocktail party at the reservoir?

						WHISTLER
				Uh, yeah.  Yeah.


EXT. RESERVOIR.

	A busy chattering can be heard.  It *is* kind of like a
	cocktail party.

						WHISTLER
				That was very good, Bish.  Remind me to make
				you an honorary blind person.

						BISHOP
				Great.

	We see the sneakers looking at hundreds, maybe thousands
	of geese on the bank of the reservoir.

						BISHOP
				Where's this road go?

						CARL
				Nowhere.  Looks like it ends right around
				that hill.

						CREASE
				What's behind the hill?

						CARL
				Nothing.  It's private property.

	Bishop realizes what this means.

						BISHOP
				Private!

	The sneakers hurry back into the van, and leave the
	geese behind them.


SHORTLY AFTER.

	They arrive a couple of hundred yards from a big, modern
	building.  Carl looks around through binoculars.  A flag
	flies out front.  A corporate sign:

					PlayTronics
				The Future of Toys

						CARL
				Forget it.  It's a toy company.

	Bishop takes the binoculars.

						BISHOP
				Toy company my ass.  That's laser fencing.
				There's high voltage on the perimeter.  The
				whole building says "Go Away." It's Cosmo, I
				know it.  The toy company's a front.
				Mother, get the directional.  Carl, get the
				video.  Let's go.

MINUTES LATER.

	Mother is aiming a super-directional microphone at
	different points on the building.  Whistler listens
	carefully.

						MOTHER
				Second floor, northwest two.

						WHISTLER
				That's a bathroom.

						MOTHER
				Second floor, northwest three.

						WHISTLER
				Uh, that's an emergency exit.

						MOTHER
				How do you know that?

	Crease is making a diagram as they go.

						WHISTLER
				I can hear the emergency floodlight
				batteries recharging.

	Mother moves onto another one.

						WHISTLER
				Hold it right there.  Crease, what's this
				mean: "My voice is my passport, verify me?"

						CREASE
				Some sort of voiceprint ID.  I'll check it
				out.

						WHISTLER
				What am I listening to now, Mother?

						MOTHER
				Third floor southwest.  Corner.

						WHISTLER
				Oh, it's bursting with ultrasonic.  I've
				never heard sensors that powerful before.
				Bish, someone is very serious about keeping
				people out of that room.

						BISHOP
				Yeah.

	Bishop camouflages a video camera.


INT. LIZ'S APARTMENT.  DAY.

	Mother points out a single lighted window in a
	time-lapse video of the building.  In the time lapse,
	dawn breaks.

						MOTHER
				Okay, there's the corner room with the
				motion detectors Whistler heard.

						BISHOP
				That's Cosmo's office.  I saw the sensors.

						MOTHER
				They keep the lights on all night, so we
				have to assume the sensors are on too.  It
				won't be easy getting in there.

						BISHOP
				Okay, run this on ahead, let's figure out
				who works next door.

	Carl bursts in excitedly.  He's carrying a large,
	rolled-up blueprint.

						CARL
				It's fascinating what fifty bucks can get
				you at the county recorder's office.

						BISHOP
				What have you got?

						CARL
				PlayTronics Corporate Headquarters.  The
				complete blueprints.

						BISHOP
				Not bad.  Not bad, Carl!

						CARL
				Why, thanks.

						BISHOP
				Where'd you get the fifty bucks?

						CARL
				I took it from Mother's wallet.

						BISHOP
				Good.

	Liz is on the phone.

						LIZ
				No, mom.  Today's not a good day to come
				over.  N...No...

	Bishop walks past her and into her kitchen.  In there,
	Crease is unpacking a large machine.

						BISHOP
				Okay, what have we got here?

						CREASE
				It's called a man-trap.  I borrowed this
				demo from the manufacturer.

						WHISTLER
				It's a digital voice recognition monitor,
				hooked up to an access booth.

						CREASE
				NSA uses the same technology to keep people
				out of restricted areas at Fort Meade.
				Card?

	He hands Bishop a card.  Bishop swipes it through the
	machine's card reader.

						CREASE
				Now speak right into this box.

	He indicates a speaker-like grille.

	Bishop reads from the screen.

						BISHOP
				Hi.  My name is Martin Bishop.  My name is
				my passport. Verify me.

	The machine buzzes and replies:

			*** ENTRY DENIED ***

						WHISTLER
				And you can't pass through unless your
				voiceprint matches the one encoded on the
				card.

						BISHOP
				So we need someone's card.

						CREASE
				And their voice.

						BISHOP
				Can we beat this with tape?

						WHISTLER
				Has to be up close and personal.

						CREASE
				Otherwise you'll be caught in the
				steel-reinforced booth while the guards with
				shotguns are called.

						BISHOP
				Oh, that's great.  Really great.  What about
				motion detectors?

						CREASE
				I'm picking one up this afternoon.  That
				makes beating this look easy.

						MOTHER
						(from the other room)
				Hey Bish.  I think we've found our guy.

	Mother's video screen shows the Playtronics building
	with just a few lights left on.

						MOTHER
				Okay, I've blown up the image a little.
				Here's the room next to Cosmo's.  Now it's
				the end of the day.

	Some lights go out in the building.

						MOTHER
						(continuing)
				Watch who comes out.  Let me zoom in on the
				front door.  A lady in a green skirt, and
				this guy with the cap. Nobody comes out for
				another eighteen minutes.

						BISHOP
				So it's one of those two.

						MOTHER
				Right.  Now here's the next evening.  Again.
				The office next to Cosmo's.  The lights go
				out.

						BISHOP
				The guy in the cap.  Anybody else?

						MOTHER
				Nobody else comes out for twenty-two
				minutes.  That's who works next door.

						BISHOP
				Good.  Okay,  we'll use his office to get
				into Cosmo's. Can we get plates?

						MOTHER
				Let's see.  Zooming in...

	He zooms in on the license plate of the car the guy in
	the cap got into.

						MOTHER
				Another bump... enhancing...

	The plate comes into clear focus: California plate "180
	IQ".

						MOTHER
				There's your plate.  180 IQ.

						BISHOP
				Hah.  Cute.  Alright.  Carl?  Let's do this
				guy.

	Crease looks up the guy's Motor Vehicle Report.

						CREASE
				His name's Werner Brandes.  Single, 6'1",
				174 pounds, must wear glasses to drive, no
				outstanding tickets or warrants.

	Bishop looks over surveillance photos of Brandes and his
	car. With a magnifying glass.

						CARL
				He leaves work between six and seven every
				night, takes the same route home, he obeys
				the speed limit and comes to a complete stop
				at every stop sign, and signals when he
				changes lanes.  He's a very safe driver.

						CREASE
						(now looking up Brandes' credit report)
				$750 limit on his Visa, pays his bills, no
				bad debts, no bum checks.  No registered
				firearms.  Member, International Microchip
				Designer's Association and chairman of the
				social committee.

						BISHOP
				Great.  The world's most boring human.  How
				the hell are we going to get close enough to
				record him?

	Bishop and Crease are startled by a crashing sound from
	the kitchen.  It's garbage.

						LIZ
				Oh, Mother!

	Mother walks in carrying two garbage bags.

						MOTHER
				Sorry, Liz.  Standard procedure.  Trash from
				the guy's house.

						LIZ
				And thank you for bringing it into mine.

	The sneakers dump the trash out onto the floor and begin
	sifting through it.

						BISHOP
				Okay, let's see here.  Phone bill, no long
				distance. Club Med brochure.  Ticket stubs
				to a Barry Manilow concert. Here it is. Here
				we go.  "Dear Compu-dater.  Welcome to the
				world of automated compatibility."  He's a
				computer dater!

						CREASE
				I love it!  Let's get him a date!

						BISHOP
				What was the name of that gal that we did...
				used in the cereal company sneak last year?

						CREASE
				Sandy Krieger?

						BISHOP
				Yeh.

						CREASE
				Forget it.  Married a cop.  How about...
				Barbara?
						(To Mother)
				She was cute.

						MOTHER
				Yeah, but she'd never do it.  She regards
				this work as juvenile.  That's why she
				divorced me.
						(To Carl)
				How about your friend Jessie?

						CARL
				Yeah, she's buff!

						LIZ
				Fellas, fellas, look at this man's trash!
				He's not looking for buff.

	Mother holds up two neatly folded empty cereal boxes.

						MOTHER
				It's the nicest garbage I've ever seen.

						LIZ
				The man who folded this tube of Crest is
				looking for someone meticulous, refined.
				Anal.

	All the sneakers look at her.  She's just described
	herself wonderfully and hasn't quite noticed yet.

						LIZ
				What...?


INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT.

	An asian man is on stage, singing "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"
	in Chinese.

	Liz winds her way through the restaurant to find
	Brandes.  When she finds him, he is putting in eye
	drops.  He stands to greet her.

						LIZ
				Werner?  Hi!  I'm Doris.

						BRANDES
				Uh... hi!  Are you ready for the Dim Sum
				bar?

						LIZ
				Oh, I'm not really in any hurry.

						BRANDES
				Alright.  I'll be right back.

	He takes off.  She sits down and waits.  She checks her
	hidden microphone and pulls out a notepad.  The notepad
	has written on it:

		Hi, my name is Werner Brandes.  My voice is my
		passport. Verify me.

	She scratches off "Hi."  Werner returns with a plate of
	Dim Sum.

						LIZ
				So.  What an interesting name you have.

	Werner stuffs a spring roll in his mouth whole, and
	starts munching.

						LIZ
				How exactly do you pronounce it?

	Werner's mouth is full.  He mumbles his reply.

						BRANDES
						(mumbling)
				Muumuu Mammbed.


INT. LIZ'S APARTMENT.

	Close-up on a high-tech looking motion sensor.

						CREASE
				This is what's in Cosmo's office.

	Mother enters the room and waves.  The sensor beeps.

						CREASE
				Best motion sensor on the market.

						MOTHER
				And watch this!

	Mother breathes on the sensor.  It beeps again.

						CREASE
				Also responds to thermal differentials.

						BISHOP
				Does this have a happy ending?

						MOTHER
				Oh yeah.  We can wrap you in a full body
				suit of neoprene heat-resistant rubber.

	He demonstrates with a neoprene wetsuit.

						MOTHER
						(continuing)
				Or we can raise the temperature in Cosmo's
				office to 98.6 degrees.  Which is probably
				what we'll have to do, because the neoprene
				would suffocate you.  Either way, you've got
				a top speed of...

	He slowly moves his neoprene-shielded hand across the
	sensor.
						MOTHER
						(continuing)
				...two... inches... per... second... any faster
				than that...

	He waves the hand quickly, the sensor beeps.

						MOTHER
						(finishing)
				and... big guys with guns. But, you'll
				probably do fine.

						BISHOP
				Since when am I the one that...

	Mother cuts him off.

						MOTHER
				This is the same model of answering machine
				that Janek used for the shell of his box,
				now that's what you'll be carrying across
				the floor at two inches per second.  I got
				that for you because I figured that you'd...
				you know, just wanna practice with it.
				Remember to... go real slow!

						BISHOP
				Slow.

						CREASE
						(facetiously)
				You get all the fun stuff!


INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT.

	Liz has crossed off all the words except "Passport."  A
	waiter is vacuuming the floor.  This date should have
	ended a long while ago.  Werner comes back to the table,
	the waiter says something to him in Chinese.

						LIZ
				So, what about travel?  Where do you like to
				go?  Europe? Mexico?

						BRANDES
				Uh, I don't know, I've never been out of the
				country. Look, I think they want us to
				leave.

	He grabs her arm.  She grabs back and forces him to sit
	down.

						LIZ
				Sit down, Werner.
						(she laughs)
				Oh, talk to me.  You know what?  I really
				love the sound of your voice.

						BRANDES
				Really?  I always thought it was kind of
				nasal and pinched.

	His voice IS nasal and pinched.

						LIZ
				Oh, no, not at all, it's lovely.  And, um,
				there's this one word... I've always loved
				the sound of this word...

						BRANDES
				Well?

						LIZ
				Oh, no!  Oh, no, you wouldn't... no...

						BRANDES
				No, I would, what?

						LIZ
				Never mind, no.

						BRANDES
				No, what?  Please.  What?

						LIZ
				I would really... like to hear you say the
				word... "passport"...

	Brandes looks confused.

						BRANDES
				Passport?

	Liz sort of half laughs, half moans with excitement.
	She kisses him on the cheek.

						LIZ
				You know, you're right, we ought to leave.

						BRANDES
				Uh, Doris?  Would you like to have breakfast
				with me?

						LIZ
				Sure, fine.

						BRANDES
				Shall I phone you or nudge you?

	Liz looks around, discomforted.

						LIZ
				Check, please!


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

	Whistler is assembling a tape loop of the words Liz got
	Brandes to say.  It sounds unnatural but seamless.

						RECORDING
				Hi!  my, name. Is, Werner Brandes.  My.
				Voice? is my. Passport???  Verify.  me...


EXT. PLAYTRONICS BUILDING.

	Carl, posing as a groundskeeper, prunes a shrub and
	walks across the parking lot and up to the building.


INT. PLAYTRONICS SECURITY BOOTH.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Is that the gardener?  I thought they
				already left.

						SECURITY GUARD #2
				I guess not.


INT. PLAYTRONICS LOBBY.

						CARL
						(to Desk Guard)
				May I use your john, please?

	Carl walks past an ornery-looking security gate and into
	the men's room.  He climbs up into a duct above the
	cieling, and starts crawling around.  Outside, the desk
	guard notices that he's been in a while.  He goes into
	the men's room, but it's unoccupied.  He goes back to
	the desk and starts to make a phone call.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Uh, listen, a few minutes ago a gardener
				came...

	He notices a gardener outside raking leaves.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Skip it, I see him.

	The other gardener is Mother.

						MOTHER
				Okay fellas, I'm out of here.  Carl, have a
				nice ride.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT.

	Carl jumps onto the roof of a moving elevator.  He gets
	off in another shaft, and enters a boiler room.  In the
	boiler room, he sets a thermotstat.  The temperature
	display starts rising.


INT. BRANDES' HOUSE.  KITCHEN.

	Brandes is cooking something.

						LIZ
				Ooo.  It's hot in here.

						BRANDES
						(chuckling)
				Uh huh!

						LIZ
				Maybe I'll just open this window a little
				bit.

	She goes over to a window and opens it.

						BRANDES
				I'll join you as soon as I'm finished
				pounding these breasts.

	Liz laughs and passes something to Mother, who is
	waiting outside.

						BRANDES
				You know, the best thing about this meal,
				besides it's absolutely fabulous, is it only
				has 400 calories.

						LIZ
				Oh, great!

						BRANDES
				You know, I'm very concerned about what we
				eat.

						LIZ
				You are.

	Mother rifles through Brandes' wallet and finds a card.

						BRANDES
				What would you say is the ideal diet?

						LIZ
				I sort of... eat, you know, sort of on the
				run... You know, I'm really busy, so...

	Mother whistles unobtrusively.

						BRANDES
				Okay, I'll tell you, the ideal diet - don't
				laugh - is the bottom of the monkey cage.

	Liz takes the wallet back from Mother.

						LIZ
				I'm sorry, what did you say?

						BRANDES
				Take a look at the bottom of the monkey
				cage.  You have, uh, greens...

	Someone knocks on the door.

						LIZ
				Is there someone at your door?

						BRANDES
				I'm not expecting anyone.

	Brandes checks the front door.  While he's not looking,
	Liz replaces his wallet.

						BRANDES
				No, nobody there.

	Liz, Oh, I'm sorry.

						BRANDES
				We're all alone.

						LIZ
				Ah.  I'll just close the window.  It's okay
				now.

	She closes the window.  Brandes goes back to his
	cooking.

						BRANDES
				No, but it's true, I read that once.

						LIZ
				Bottom of the monkey cage!  What are you
				talking about?

						BRANDES
				You have fruit, you have greens, you have...

	Mother drives away.


INT. PLAYTRONICS BULDING.

	A security guard watches a monitor.  The phone rings.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Good evening, Playtronics.

	Bishop casually walks up to the security gate.  He
	swipes Brandes' card through.  The gate lets him
	through.  A printout shows that Werner Brandes has
	entered through the front entrance at 8:20 PM on October
	26.  Inconvenient time to answer the phone...


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

	Mother is reading a tabloid.

						MOTHER
				Cattle mutilations are up!

						CREASE
				Don't!

						MOTHER
				Sorry.


INT. PLAYTRONICS CORRIDOR.

	Bishop, now wearing glasses, strides through the
	corridor.  He enters a stairwell and goes up.  He
	attaches a small black box to the security camera.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

	Suddenly, a bank of security monitors in the van light
	up with pictures from inside the building.

						MOTHER
				Hey, here we go.

						CREASE
						(on radio)
				Martin, we've got video.

						MOTHER
				Whsitler, hit record.

						WHISTLER
				Rolling.

						CREASE
						(continuing)
				The pictures are coming in fine.  You are
				clear all the way up to the man-trap.


INT. PLAYTRONICS CORRIDOR.

	Bishop swipes Brandes' card again and enters the
	man-trap.  He plays a tape.  It's too fast.  The machine
	buzzes gently and says:

		*** ENTRY DENIED ***
		Please speak more slowly.

	Bishop quickly rewinds.  He plays it back normal speed.

						RECORDING
				Hi!  my, name. Is, Werner Brandes.  My.
				Voice? is my. Passport???  Verify.  me...

	The machine displays "*** THANK YOU ***" and lets him
	through.

	He enters Brandes' office using the card.  A security
	printout clicks to register the fact.  He empties his
	briefcase and takes off his tie.


INT. BOILER ROOM.

	The temperature gauge now says 88.1 degrees and rising.


INT. BRANDES' OFFICE.

	Bishop is up in the cieling, now moving over Cosmo's
	office.  He lifts a panel and looks down.  The sensors,
	the Cray, the designer wire furniture, and the metal
	briefcase containing Janek's box are all in plain view.
	He lowers a sound sensor into the room.

						BISHOP
				There's a three foot area in the corner just
				outside the sensors' range.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						CREASE
				Good.  Hold on.  Whistler?

						WHISTLER
				Carl, how's the weather?


INT. BOILER ROOM.

						CARL
				98.6 and holding!


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						WHISTLER
				Beauty.  We got body temp, Crease!

						CREASE
				Go.


INT. CIELING CRAWLSPACE.

	Bishop carefully lowers himself into Cosmo's office, in
	the area behind the sensors that is out of their range.
	He starts walking excruciatingly slowly.


INT. BRANDES' HOUSE.

	Liz is looking out the window.

						BRANDES
				Once again, I am so sorry about dinner.

						LIZ
				No, it was really delicious.

						BRANDES
				No, no, I overcooked the carrots.

						LIZ
				No, I like them really squishy like that.

	Liz notices a stuffed toy dog.

						LIZ
				That's cute!

	Brandes lights up.

						BRANDES
				Oh, uh watch.  Watch this!

	Brandes snaps his fingers.

						BRANDES
				Play dead!

	The toy dog rolls over onto its back.

						LIZ
				Great!

	Brandes laughs.

						BRANDES
				I designed the voice recognition chip.

						LIZ
				What a thing to do.  Could I just make a
				quick phone call?

						BRANDES
				Sure, uh, it's in the bedroom.

						LIZ
				Upstairs?

						BRANDES
				Yeah, just go upstairs and then you walk
				straight forward.  And the first one is a
				closet.

	She goes.  The toy dog thinks it hears a command: "Walk
	Straight Forward."  It complies and walks straight
	forward.  It knock's Liz's purse off the table.

						BRANDES
				Oh pooch.  Look what you've done to Doris'
				purse!

	He picks up the purse, and her wallet which has fallen
	out.  It opens up to her driver's licence.  He takes a
	look and realizes that Liz's name is not Doris.

						BRANDES
				Hmm.


INT. COSMO'S OFFICE.

	Bishop continues to walk painstakingly across the room.


INT. BRANDES' BEDROOM.

	Liz is on the phone, but it's just ringing.  Brandes
	arrives at the door and knocks.

						BRANDES
				Psst.  What do you say we go for a ride...
				Doris.


INT. COSMO'S OFFICE.

	Bishop is still moving across the room at top speed, 2
	inches per second.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						CREASE
				I don't believe it!  Now what are you
				saying, the NSA killed Kennedy?

						MOTHER
				No, they shot him, but they didn't kill him.
				He's still alive!

						CREASE
				That's it.  I've had it.  I don't want to
				talk to you anymore.  You just do your job.
				I don't want to talk to you anymore.

						MOTHER
				Okay, fine.  It was the same people who
				framed Pete Rose.

						CREASE
						(exasperated)
				Ugh!


EXT. ROAD TO PLAYTRONICS.  NIGHT.

	Brandes is driving to work.  At night.  With Liz.

						LIZ
				Boy, this was fun.  Want to go back?

						BRANDES
				Oh, no, we're almost there.

						LIZ
				Almost where?


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						MOTHER
				Crease.

						CREASE
				Forget it.

						MOTHER
				No, no, no, Crease.

						CREASE
				Forget it!

						MOTHER
				Werner just pulled up.  He's got Liz with
				him.

						CREASE
				Oh no.

	Crease gets on the radio.

						CREASE
				Martin, I think you'd better hurry.


INT. COSMO'S OFFICE.

						BISHOP
				The one thing I can't do is hurry.

	He opens the briefcase.  Inside is Janek's answering
	machine.


INT. PLAYTRONICS FRONT DESK.

	Liz protests incomprehensibly as Brandes drags her to
	the security guard.

						BRANDES
						(mimicking Liz)
				Come on, I want you to say it for me just
				one time, "Passport", you have such a
				beautiful voice!

	They reach the guard.

						BRANDES
				Hi.  I'm Dr. Brandes, I work up on three,
				and I believe that this phoney is involved
				in some kind of plot to break into my
				office.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Hold it, hold it!  Let me see your entry
				card.

	Brandes doesn't have it.

						BRANDES
				You took my card!

						LIZ
				What card?  See, I...

	They go on arguing, and another security guard behind a
	booth makes a phone call upstairs.

						SECURITY GUARD #2
				Sir, we have a problem.


INT. COSMO'S OFFICE.

	Carrying Janek's box, Bishop inches his way back across
	the room.  He makes it back to the sensors' blind spot.


INT. PLAYTRONICS FRONT DESK.

	Dick Gordon and Buddy Wallace arrive on the scene.  Liz
	and Brandes are still arguing with the desk guard.

						BRANDES
				...now there is a great idea, call the
				police!  I'm very sorry to disturb you, but
				I think that someone is trying to break into
				my office!

	Now Cosmo shows up.

						COSMO
				Let's take a look at his office.


INT. BRANDES' OFFICE.

	Bishop hurriedly puts everything back in his briefcase.


INT. STAIRWELL.

	Cosmo, Gordon, Liz, Wallace, and Brandes make their way
	upstairs.


INT. BRANDES' OFFICE.

	Bishop grabs his briefcase and goes back up inside the
	cieling.


INT. PLAYTRONICS CORRIDOR.

	Cosmo uses a remote control to completely bypass the
	man-trap. All five walk through.  They arrive at
	Brandes' office and hit the lights.  Bishop has *just*
	made it.  Brandes looks around.

						COSMO
				Well?

						BRANDES
				Well, uh, everything seems to be in order.

						COSMO
				Does it?

						BRANDES
				Yessir.

						GORDON
				We're very sorry to have troubled you, miss.

						LIZ
				Not as sorry as I am, Werner.

	They all leave.

						BISHOP
				They're letting her go.


INT. PLAYTRONICS CORRIDOR.

						COSMO
				We'll call you a cab.

						LIZ
				Thank you.  This is my last computer date.

	Cosmo thinks about this.

						COSMO
				Wait.  A computer matched her with him?  I
				don't think so.

	Gordon and Wallace start back.

						COSMO
				Marty!

	He runs back to his own office, using his remote control
	to enter.

						COSMO
				Why is it so hot in here?

	He runs to his desk and opens the metal briefcase.  It
	is empty.

						COSMO
						(furious)
				MARTY!


EXT. PLAYTRONICS BUILDING.

	The whole complex goes into a full scale security
	lockdown. Floodlights light, alarms wail. Armed men pour
	in from out of nowhere.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						CREASE
				Martin, we've got six guards in the front
				lobby, four in the south corridor, second
				floor, five upstairs north.

						MOTHER
				Guards in the boiler room.

						CREASE
				Oh, God.
						(into mic)
				Carl, listen carefully. You've got trouble.

	Mother opens the blueprint.

						MOTHER
				Heating ducts, over the furnace.

						CREASE
				You'll be alright.  Just find the heating
				ducts above the furnace.

						MOTHER
				That'll get him to the elevator.

						CREASE
				That will lead you to the elevator chasm.
				Martin, there's a fire escape at the end of
				the north corridor.  You'll have to break
				through a couple of firewalls.

						MOTHER
				Have him go south.

						CREASE
				No!  Go directly north!

						MOTHER
				There's an air duct there!

						CREASE
				Directly north about thirty yards!  Once
				you're there, let me know.


INT. PLAYTRONICS SECURITY.

	Dick Gordon and Cosmo oversee the sweep for Bishop and
	Carl.

						GORDON
						(into intercom)
				Blue team, move to southwest corridor one.
				Green team, secure north corridor three.
				White team, secure all exits...

						COSMO
				He'll be in a crawl space.  Break through.

	Two guards with shotguns comply.


INT. CIELING CRAWLSPACE.

	A guard climbs up into a cieling crawlspace and looks
	around. Bishop gets out of his sight just in time.

						BISHOP
				Crease, I'm in Northeast 3 over the
				corridor.  I think it's a dead end.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						CREASE
				Don't move.  And don't worry, we'll get you
				out of there.

						MOTHER
				Whistler, we've got guards in every
				stairwell.  Can you hear if there's any...

	Mother notices that a guard has found their video
	transmitter. The guard abruptly yanks it.  All the
	monitors go blank.

						MOTHER
				Oh, no.


INT. CIELING CRAWLSPACE.

						BISHOP
				What?  Don't say "Oh, no."


INT. PLAYTRONICS CORRIDOR.

	Buddy Wallace strolls down the corridor carrying a
	mean-looking shotgun.

						WALLACE
						(into radio)
				This is Wallace, I'm in Northeast 3, going
				to check it out.


INT. CIELING CRAWLSPACE.

	Bishop hears him below.

						CREASE
						(over radio)
				Martin, we've lost pictures...

	In the quiet, the noise of Bishop's earpiece can be
	heard by Wallace.  Bishop desperately tries to cover it
	up but it's too late.

						CREASE
				DO YOU READ ME??


INT. PLAYTRONICS CORRIDOR.

	Wallace smiles, he knows he has Bishop cornered.  He
	shoots into the cieling.  And again.  And again.  And
	again.  His fourth shot barely misses Bishop.

						COSMO
						(over P.A.)
				Stop shooting.  Marty?  I know you are in
				the building, and I know you can hear me.
				Whoo, God.  You should not have come back,
				Marty.  I won, you lost.

	Cosmo's voice echoes throughout the entire building.

						COSMO
						(continuing)
				And if our friendship had meant anything to
				you at all, that's the way you should have
				left it, but you always had to be the one to
				win, didn't you?  You're the one who got
				away with things while I never did.  You
				always had to get the girl, didn't you?  So
				I never did.  At least not until now.

INT. COSMO'S OFFICE.

	Liz looks on from a wire couch in Cosmo's office.

						COSMO
				She's lovely, Marty.


INT. CIELING CRAWLSPACE.

	Bishop gasps, astonished and fearful.


INT. COSMO'S OFFICE.

						COSMO
				Please, Marty, please bring me the box.  You
				must come. I will never let either of you
				live if you try to get out.  I am your way
				out.  I'm your only way out.  If I wanted
				you dead, you would be dead.  Marty, I
				cannot kill you.  I cannot kill you. You
				have to trust me.


INT. CIELING CRAWLSPACE.

						BISHOP
				Guys, I'm going in.  You hear me, Carl?

						CARL
				Yes...

	Bishop pulls a cieling panel aside.  Below is Wallace,
	ready to blow him away.


INT. COSMO'S OFFICE.

	Wallace leads Bishop in at gunpoint.

						BISHOP
				Hi.

						LIZ
				Hi.

						BISHOP
				How are you?

						LIZ
				Fine.  How are you?

	Bishop just sighs.

						LIZ
				Yeah.

						COSMO
				So you have my box?

						BISHOP
				We have a deal, right?

	Cosmo starts to leave.

						BISHOP
				Wait a second.  Wait a minute.

	Dick Gordon loads his pistol.

						BISHOP
				Goddamnit, you gave me your word!

						COSMO
				I cannot kill my friend.
						(To Wallace and Gordon)
				Kill my friend!

						BISHOP
				Son of a bitch!

						WALLACE
						(smiling broadly)
				You didn't really think we were gonna let
				you go, did you?

						BISHOP
				You didn't really think I was going to let
				you have this box, did you?

						WALLACE
				What?

						BISHOP
				Now.

						WALLACE
				Now?  What are you talking about, "Now?"

						BISHOP
				Now!

						WALLACE
				Damn right, now!

	Wallace and Gordon take aim.

						BISHOP
				Carl, now!

	Carl leaps through the cieling panel and lands squarely
	on Gordon, knocking him down.  In the split second of
	distraction, Bishop grabs Wallace's shotgun.  Liz
	screams.  The two men struggle.  Liz picks up Gordon's
	pistol.

						LIZ
				Let go of him!

	She fires a shot into the cieling.  Wallace and Bishop
	stop struggling.  She's shaking and hyperventilating.

						LIZ
				I mean it!  I'm an excellent marksman...
				woman...

	Wallace puts his hands up.

						LIZ
				Move!

						WALLACE
				Oh sure, sure.

	Bishop takes the gun from Liz.

						BISHOP
				Get up.

	Wallace slowly complies.

						BISHOP
				Yeeeeoooou...

	Bishop smacks Wallace squarely in the jaw with the gun.
	Wallace falls, out cold.

						BISHOP
				Carl, what the hell were you waiting for?

						CARL
				That's not easy, what I just did!

						LIZ
				Guys, can we get out of here?

	The three run to a stairwell and go up.


EXT. PLAYTRONICS ROOF.  NIGHT.

	Bishop, Carl, and Liz run across the roof, dodging
	spotlights.

						BISHOP
				Crease, we're on the roof.  There's a fire
				escape on the north side.  Is it clear?


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						CREASE
				Yes, clear.

EXT. PLAYTRONICS ROOF.

	The three reach the fire escape.

						BISHOP
				Where are you?

						CREASE
						(over radio)
				On a hill overlooking the northeast corner
				of the parking lot.

	The van's headlights flash.

						CARL
				There!

						BISHOP
				Beautiful, come and get us.

	Carl and Liz go down the fire escape.

						BISHOP
				And hurry up, we've only got a few minutes
				before anybody knows we're gone.


EXT. SNEAKER VAN.

	Crease and Mother go up front.  Mother starts the van.

						CREASE
				Coming to get you.

	Two guards appear, weapons drawn.

						GUARD
				Put your hands where I can see them and step
				out of the van.
						(To Crease)
				You too, midnight.

	Whistler, still in the back of the van, puts on a radio
	headset.

						WHISTLER
				Bish... they've got Crease and Mother!


EXT. FIRE ESCAPE.

						BISHOP
				Shit! Whistler, you've gotta do it.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						WHISTLER
				Do what?


EXT. FIRE ESCAPE.

						BISHOP
				You've gotta drive.  I'll talk you through
				it.  Now hurry.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

						WHISTLER
				D-Drive what?


EXT. SNEAKER VAN.

	The guards frisk Crease and Mother.  Whistler comes up
	to the driver's seat.

						WHISTLER
				Okay, Bish.

						BISHOP
				Now, there's a gate about thirty yards
				behind you.  Put it in reverse and floor it.

						CREASE
				Did I ever tell you why I had to leave the
				CIA?

						MOTHER
				No?

						WHISTLER
				Uh, what's reverse?

						BISHOP
				Uh, one down.

						CREASE
				My temper.

	Whistler floors it in reverse.  The van takes off.  In
	the split second of distraction, Crease overpowers both
	guards.

						MOTHER
				Wow!

						CREASE
				Motherfuckers mess with me, I'll split your
				heads!

						MOTHER
				Uh, Crease, where's Whistler going?

						WHISTLER
				Uh, Bish?  I'm going backwards.

						BISHOP
				You're doing fine... you're doing fine.

	The van, going backwards, breaks through a gate.
	Whistler yells.

						BISHOP
				Now, hit the brakes, now!

	The van screeches to a halt.

						BISHOP
				Okay, Whistler, put the gear shift down two
				notches.

	Whistler shifts gears.

						BISHOP
				Turn left, floor it.

						WHISTLER
				I'm going forward.

						BISHOP
				Straighten out, straighten out!

	The van straightens out.  It jumps curbs and grassy
	islands in the parking lot.

						WHISTLER
				What... what was that?

						BISHOP
				Okay, keep coming...

						WHISTLER
				Oh God, I'm driving.  I'm driving.

	The van continues to jump curbs across the parking lot.
	Whistler covers his face.

						WHISTLER
				Oh no, don't do that, I'm driving!

	Whistler is coming up on some cars now.

						BISHOP
				Whoa, whoa, whoa, go left... uh... my left!
				Right! Right, right!

	Bishop is too late. Whistler hits two cars, which spin
	out of the way.  The van keeps going.

						BISHOP
				It's... it's okay.  Beautiful, now keep
				coming.  Keep coming.  Now, you're going to
				go down a very... gentle slope.

						WHISTLER
				Oh, okay, fine, great.  No problem.

	The "slope" is not at all gentle.

						WHISTLER
				Whoo-oa!  Oh boy!

						BISHOP
				Okay.  Five more seconds, then stop.

	The van crashes into a wall.  Whistler's headset is
	knocked off.

						WHISTLER
				I think I'll stop right here.

	Liz and Carl run to the van.

						LIZ
				Whistler, that was great!

						CARL
				Whistler!

						WHISTLER
				Where to?

						CARL
				Oh no, I'm taking the wheel.  In the back.

	Mother and Crease run up to the van.

						CREASE
				Where's Martin?

	Bishop starts down the fire escape.

						COSMO
				Marty!

	Cosmo aims a gun at Bishop.

						COSMO
				Would you step away from the ladder?

	Bishop does.

						COSMO
				You will give me the box right now, or I
				will kill you, right now.

						BISHOP
				No.

	Cosmo fires.  He just misses.

						BISHOP
				Jesus!

						COSMO
				Just give me the box, Marty!

						BISHOP
				I thought you couldn't kill your friend,
				Cos!

						COSMO
				I missed on purpose, now give me the box!

						BISHOP
				Take the goddamn thing!  I don't want it!
				You win, I lose, that's what you want, isn't
				it?  Say it.  Say it!

						COSMO
				YES!

	Bishop gives Cosmo the box.

						BISHOP
				I'm sorry, Cos.

						COSMO
				You could have shared this with me.

						BISHOP
				I know.

						COSMO
				You could have had the power.

						BISHOP
				I don't want it.

						COSMO
				Don't you know the places we can go with
				this?

						BISHOP
				Yeah, I do.  There's nobody there.

						COSMO
				Exactly!  The world isn't run by weapons
				anymore, or energy, or money, it's run by
				little ones and zeroes, little bits of data.
				It's all just electrons.

						BISHOP
				I don't care.

						COSMO
				I don't expect other people to understand
				this, but I do expect YOU to understand
				this!  We started this journey together!

						BISHOP
				It wasn't a "journey", Cos.  It was a prank.

						COSMO
				There's a war out there, old friend, a world
				war.  And it's not about who's got the most
				bullets, it's about who controls the
				information.  What we see and hear, how we
				work, what we think, it's all about the
				information!

						BISHOP
				If I were you, I'd destroy that thing.

	Bishop starts down the ladder again.

						COSMO
				Don't go.

	Cosmo again takes aim at Bishop.

						COSMO
				Don't go.

						BISHOP
				You do what you have to do, Cos, but if you
				want to stop me, you'll have to pull the
				trigger.

	Bishop continues down the ladder.  Cosmo lets him.
	Cosmo looks inside the box.  It is empty!  He's
	astonished.  Meanwhile, the van speeds away.


INT. SNEAKER VAN.

	As they drive back to the office, Bishop opens the REAL
	box. The codebreaker chip is still inside.


INT. MARTIN BISHOP & ASSOCIATES OFFICES.  NIGHT.

	The sneakers return to the office for the first time in
	days.

						CREASE
				I can't believe we actually made it back.

						CARL
				I can't believe that we pulled off the
				greatest sneak in history and we can't tell
				anybody about it.

						MOTHER
				You know what I can't believe?  I can't
				believe tomorrow's Thursday!

	Someone else turns on a light.  He aims his gun at
	Mother.

						NSA AGENT
				Not one word.

	A female NSA agent with a submachine gun appears.

						FEMALE AGENT
				Okay, all of you, step over here.  Hands
				over your heads.  Move!

	The agents herd the sneakers up against the wall of the
	conference room.

						ABBOTT
				Mr. Bishop.  I'm Bernard Abbott.  National
				Security Agency.  We spoke on the phone.  I
				believe you have something that belongs to
				me.

						BISHOP
				It's interesting, don't you think, you guys?
				That the NSA is here?  I thought the FBI was
				supposed to do this kind of thing.

						CREASE
				Absolutely.  This is outside the NSA's
				jurisdiction.

						WHISTLER
				Unless the NSA didn't want anybody to know
				about Janek's little black box.

						BISHOP
				I keep thinking about something Greg told
				me.  He said that our codes were based on an
				entirely different system than the Russian
				codes.  So this box really wouldn't work on
				them. The only thing it would really be good
				for is spying on Americans.

						MOTHER
				Oh, sure, with a box like that, they could
				read the FBI's mail.

						WHISTLER
				Or the CIA's. Or the White House's!

						CREASE
				No wonder they don't want to share with the
				other children.

						ABBOTT
				What do you want, Mr. Bishop?

						BISHOP
				Clear up my record.  Get out of my life.

						ABBOTT
				I don't have much choice, do I?

						BISHOP
				Not unless you want to read about it in
				Newsweek.

						ABBOTT
				Deal.  The box.

						MOTHER
				Not so fast.  I want a Winnebago.

						ABBOTT
				What?

						MOTHER
				Fully equipped.  Big kitchen.  Waterbed.
				AM/FM CD. Microwave.

						ABBOTT
				This is not a car dealership, pal!

						BISHOP
				He wants a Winnebago.

						ABBOTT
						(grudgingly)
				Alright.  A Winnebago.

						MOTHER
				Thank you.  Burgundy interior.

						ABBOTT
				Now the box.

	Crease clears his throat.

						CREASE
				Uh, I have never taken my wife to Europe.

						ABBOTT
				I'm sorry to hear it.
						(to Bishop)
				Give me the box!

						CREASE
				You will buy me two round trip first class
				tickets to Athens, Lisbon, Madrid, and
				Scotland.

						BISHOP
				Don't forget Tahiti.

						CREASE
				And Tahiti.

						ABBOTT
				Tahiti is not in Europe!

						CARL
				Excuse me, when you get the box, you can
				give us geography lessons, until then, this
				man goes to Tahiti.

						ABBOTT
				Fine.  Tahiti!

						BISHOP
				Carl?

	Carl walks up to Abbott and speaks quietly.

						CARL
				The young lady with the...
						(he checks)
				...Uzi.  Is she... single?

						BISHOP
				Uh, you know, Carl...
						(to Abbott)
				Excuse us please.

	Bishop takes Carl aside.

						BISHOP
				This is the brass ring.  Now, you've got to
				think bigger thoughts.

						CARL
				I just want her telephone number.  Please?

	The young woman lowers her weapon, amazed.

						BISHOP
						(to Abbott)
				How about a lunch?  You can chaperone.

						ABBOTT
				No!  I will not do this.

						BISHOP
				Hey, Abbie. Abbie, come on, now the FBI
				would give him twins!

						ABBOTT
				NO!

						FEMALE AGENT
				Wait a second.  You can have anything you
				want, and you're asking for my phone number.

						CARL
				Yes.

	She smiles.

						FEMALE AGENT
				273-9164.  Area code 415.

						CARL
				I'm Carl.

						FEMALE AGENT
				I'm Mary.

						ABBOTT
				I'm going to be sick!  Are we done here?

						BISHOP
				No, not yet.  Whistler?

	Whistler walks out into the middle of the room.

						WHISTLER
				I want peace on earth and goodwill toward
				men.

						ABBOTT
				Oh, this is ridiculous.

						BISHOP
				He's serious.

						WHISTLER
				I want peace on earth and goodwill toward
				men.

						ABBOTT
				We are the United States Government.  We
				don't do that sort of thing.

						BISHOP
				You're just going to have to try.

						ABBOTT
						(eyes narrowing)
				Alright!  I'll see what I can do.

						WHISTLER
				Thank you very much.
						(shaking Abbott's hand)
				That's all I ask.

						ABBOTT
						(to Liz)
				How about you?  What do you want?

						LIZ
				Oh, I'm fine.

	She smiles sweetly.

						ABBOTT
				May I have the box?

	Bishop gives him the box.

						BISHOP
				You know it doesn't work.  It never did.

						ABBOTT
				That's not important, is it?  What's really
				important is that none of this ever
				happened.  This box doesn't exist.

						BISHOP
				I never saw it before.

						ABBOTT
				Remember that.

	Abbott and the agents leave.

						LIZ
				Bishop.  All you did was say it was broken.
				Can't they still just hook it up and do
				terrible things with it?

	Bishop shows her Janek's chip.

						BISHOP
				Nope!


LATER.

						TV NEWS ANCHOR
				In a surprise announcement, the Republican
				National Committee has revealed it is
				bankrupt!  A spokesman for the party said
				they had plenty of money in their accounts
				last week, but today they just don't know
				where the money has gone. But not
				everybody's going begging.  Amnesty
				International, Greenpeace, and the United
				Negro College Fund announced record earnings
				this week, due mostly to large, anonymous
				donations.


	The credits roll.
