              FADE IN:
 
 
         1    EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DUSK
 
              We're rapidly moving across the water, skimming, towards the
              dark woods on the far shore.
 
 
         2    EXT. BACK ROAD/INT. TOYOTA CELICA - DUSK
 
              ELIZABETH MARCUS drives her Toyota Celica along this heavily
              wooded road.  She's a young woman, innocent looking, sweet
              and pretty.
 
              The light is fading.  Shadows begin to overtake the land.
 
              She is obviously some place remote.  A sign caught briefly
              in her headlights says, "CRYSTAL LAKE - 4 MILES".  Elizabeth
              swings the car around a barely seen curve in the road.  She
              pulls up...
 
 
         3    EXT. DESERTED CABIN - DUSK
 
              Elizabeth parks the Toyota.  She gets out, takes a look at
              the cabin.
 
              A "FOR RENT" sign hangs, tacked to the porch at an angle.
              The place looks dark, dirty, uninviting.
 
              She moves to her rear door, opens it and bends in to get her
              over-night bag.  Behind her, the darkness gapes with the
              ominous threat of violence.
 
              She comes back out of the car and moves to the cabin.  A
              porch swing, rotted and unusable, BANGS METHODICALLY against
              the old wood of the house.  Elizabeth fumbles for the keys
              and drops them.
 
              As she bends down to pick off, the "FOR RENT" sign snaps it
              chain and swings down, missing her neck by inches.
 
              Startled, she rips the sign off and tosses it onto the porch
              with a LOUD BANG.
 
 
         4    INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DUSK
 
              Elizabeth enters.  The place is damp and dank.  A layer of
              moldy dust has gathered.  Shadows obscure the corners of the
              room.
 
              Elizabeth put down her bag and gropes the wall for a switch.
              She finds one.  Flips it.  The light turns on for a few brief
              moments...then sputters and goes out.

                                  ELIZABETH
                        Shit...
 
              She turns and goes back outside.
 
 
         5    EXT. DESERTED CABIN - DUSK
 
              Elizabeth walks slowly around the cabin, towards a decrepit
              old woodshed at the edge of a dark, unfriendly woods.  She
              slowly opens the door...a mossy ladder rests against the far
              wall.
 
              Elizabeth enters and walks towards the ladder.  Suddenly, the
              woodshed door BANGS CLOSED.  Elizabeth SHRIEKS then,
              scrabbling at the door, flings it open and rushes outside
              with the ladder.
 
              There is a RUSTLE off among the trees.  She hesitates again.
              Footsteps on dry leaves?  Just a gust of wind off the lake?
 
              With a last look over her shoulder, she drags the ladder back
              towards the cabin and enters.
 
 
         6    INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              Elizabeth comes back in with the ladder.  She picks up her
              bag, removes a four pack of bulbs and, climbing on the
              ladder, replaces the bulb in the living room.  The light
              comes on...but it's scant illumination against the dark night.
 
              Suddenly, her foot slips on the slimy step of the ladder and
              she drops the old bulb, which SHATTERS LOUDLY on the floor.
 
              Grimacing, Elizabeth climbs down the ladder and quickly
              sweeps up the broken glass.  Having done that, she shuts the
              front door all the way, then puts her bag on the bed and
              opens it.  She takes out a few pairs of jeans and some shirts
              and moves to the standing wardrobe.
 
              We know that she will open the doors of that wardrobe and
              come face to face with her death.
 
              She opens the wardrobe.
 
              Nothing...just a moth.
 
              She puts her clothes away.  The sound of a branch SCRAPING
              against the side of the cabin adds to the tension.  Now she
              turns...
 
              ...there is no one waiting there in the doorway.

              Elizabeth yawns, stretches and walks up the stairwell to the
              second floor landing, which leads into a pitch black hallway.
 
 
         7    INT. DESERTED CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              She moves down the hallway, then enters the bathroom and
              turns on the light.  Crossing to the bathtub, she bends down
              and turns on the hot water.  It comes spitting out, brackish
              and brown at first, then finally clear.
 
              She stays, bent over the tub, letting the dirty water run
              down the drain.  Then she puts the plug in, filling the tub
              for a bath.  As it fills, she undresses down to the her
              T-shirt and underwear.
 
              She looks over to discover that the medicine cabinet door is
              open.  She crosses to it and closes it.
 
              This has got to be the one.  She will close that door and
              there, reflected in the mirror will be...
 
              ...nothing, just the dim illumination of the bathroom light.
 
              She bends down to test the temperature of the tub water.
              It's good.
 
              She removes her underwear and t-shirt, then puts one foot in
              the water, testing it, then eases into the comforting warmth.
 
              The light in the bathroom sputters and then burns out.
 
              Elizabeth SIGHS, resigned, then continues climbing into the
              tub when -- WHAM!
 
 
         8    INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              The front door blows open, banging into the wall.
 
 
         9    INT. DESERTED CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              Elizabeth turns, startled.  She grabs her towel (brushing by
              her makeup bag) and, wrapping the towel around her, walks
              slowly down the dark hallway onto the landing.
 
              From downstairs, she HEARS A NOISE.
 
 
        10    INT. CABIN - NIGHT
 
              Bending precariously far out over the landing, she looks down
              onto the first floor.

              HER POV
 
              Nothing but the stirring of leaves, blowing into the cabin
              through the open doorway.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              as a cool breeze from the doorway makes her shiver.  Slowly,
              she moves towards the stairs when we HEAR THAT SOUND AGAIN
              from downstairs.  What the hell is it?  Once again she leans
              far out over the landing.
 
              HER POV
 
              Still nothing.  Leaves.  The WHINE OF THE WIND.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              looking -- something must have made that noise.  Then,
              suddenly, from the perfect darkness behind her, JASON
              VOORHEES steps out, hockey mask in place, machete sharp and
              ready.
 
              Elizabeth stands back up, OBSCURING JASON FROM VIEW.
 
              CLOSE ON ELIZABETH
 
              feeling that something is definitely not right...in fact,
              something is really, really wrong.  With a panicked
              expression, she turns around to look behind her.
 
              HER POV
 
              Nothing.  Darkness.  Jason is gone.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              Relaxing -- everything's okay.  She turns towards the stairs
              and right into Jason, who raises his machete high.
 
              With a SCREAM, she leaps backwards as Jason swings, flying
              through the rotted wood of the railing and crashing down onto
              the first floor.
 
              ON JASON
 
              yanking his machete from the wooden bolster on the railing.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              looking down at her towel.  It's sliced through -- a thin
              line of blood crossing her stomach in a diagonal.  She runs.

        11    EXT. DESERTED CABIN - NIGHT
 
              Elizabeth leaps from the porch, over an overrun flowerbed,
              onto the hood of her car.  She quickly looks behind her.
 
              HER POV
 
              to see Jason striding through the front door of the the
              cabin, coming for her.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              as she skids all the way across the hood of the car onto the
              far side, then runs through the trees and brush in front of
              the house -- her feet bare, her eyes panicked.  The branches
              seem to claw at her, tearing, scratching...
 
              JASON'S POV
 
              quickly gaining.  God, he moves fast!  Elizabeth turns, sees
              us and SCREAMS.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              turning back to face forward when -- WHACK!  She's clipped by
              a tree and knocked to the ground.  She scrambles up and looks
              around.
 
              HER POV
 
              Jason is nowhere to be seen.
 
              Elizabeth moves slowly now, turning around, her breathing
              quick and panicked.  Where is he?!  Is he toying with her?!
              She turns and Jason leaps in front of her, machete raised.
 
              Suddenly, Elizabeth reaches into the cleavage at the front of
              her towel and pulls out a small pistol.
 
                                  ELIZABETH
                        Eat me, you bastard!
 
              She fires one shot directly into Jason's forehead, knocking
              him back at step, then turns and bolts towards --
 
 
        12    EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - NIGHT
 
              She runs into this clearing then turns to see Jason rapidly
              coming after her, striding out into the open, raising his
              machete ready to deliver the lethal blow when, suddenly,
 
              INTENSE BRIGHT LIGHTS SNAP ON AROUND THE CLEARING

              stunning Jason for a moment.  The girl disappears into the
              treeline as
 
              THE DEAFENING ROAR OF GUNFIRE
 
              cracks out from the darkness.  There are FBI AGENTS hidden
              behind every tree, bush and rock...and now, they are all
              firing on Jason at once.
 
              Jason jerks as the bullets tear into his body.
 
              Then there is a moment...the FBI agents watching...waiting
              for Jason to fall.
 
              But he doesn't fall.  He stands there.  His head turning
              slowly, searching the darkness for his next kill.  Suddenly,
              from out of the darkness we hear:
 
                                  FBI AGENT ABERNATHY
                        Incoming!
 
              We hear a muffled SHOOMP! sound, then a familiar WHISTLING as
              a mortar shell descends on Jason in the middle of the
              clearing.
 
              The grenade lands right at Jason's feet.
 
              An anxious beat...then...
 
              THE MORTAR EXPLODES!
 
              We watch as Jason is blown, irrevocably, limb from limb.
 
              ON VARIOUS CHUNKS OF JASON
 
              spinning slowly in the air in SLO-MO.  An arm, something
              unrecognizable, his head still in the hockey mask, then,
              finally
 
              ON JASON'S BLACK HEART
 
              spinning through the air to finally land, with a WET PLOP, on
              the field.  It beats once, then once more...then stops.
 
              A moment of silence...then the rest of the FBI agents emerge
              from their hiding places.  There is an eerie after-the-battle
              silence to the scene.  Jason's crimes have been so heinous
              that even in death, proximity to his mangled remains seems to
              render a somber atmosphere.
 
              AGENT ABERNATHY makes his way through his quiet, somehow
              stunned men, and over to Elizabeth.  He is clearly the man in
              charge -- his suit alone says that and his demeanor backs it up.

              Elizabeth stands and faces him.  It is a strange tableau...the
              bright lights, the smoke in the air, the nearly naked woman
              facing the man in the suit.
 
              Agent Abernathy offers his hand.
 
                                  ABERNATHY
                        Good job, Agent Marcus.
 
                                  ELIZABETH
                               (shaking his hand)
                        Thank you, sir.
 
              A T.V. Camera is thrust into Abernathy's face.  The MEDIA has
              apparently caught wind of this event.  REPORTERS scream for
              "Agent Abernathy...your comments..."  "What was your first
              thought when..."  Abernathy smiles and puts on his best
              "media" face.
 
                                  ABERNATHY
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, please...
                        please...
 
              The CROWD QUIETS.
 
                                  ABERNATHY
                               (continuing)
                        It is my pleasure to announce that
                        Jason Voorhees is finally and
                        irrevocably...dead.
 
              ANGLE ON A LONE MAN
 
              sitting some distance away on the rise of a hill.  His
              weathered face shows a healthy contempt for this somewhat
              premature celebration.  He plugs a twisty, homegrown cigar
              into the corner of his mouth, light a match off the beard
              stubble on his chin, then fires up the cigar -- a glowing
              coal in the darkness.  His hawk's eyes stare at something
              with ferocious intent...
 
              ON JASON'S HEART
 
              Laying on the ground in the clearing, not beating...but
              intact.
 
                                                       MATCH CUT TO:
 
 
        13    INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
 
              Where we see the heart on a rolling metal surgical table.

              PULL BACK TO REVEAL
 
              A CORONER, a big man in his 30's, as he rolls the cart up to
              a security checkpoint manned by TWO FBI AGENTS.  The coroner
              hands his I.D. to FBI AGENT 1, then lifts his arms as FBI
              AGENT 2 pats him down.
 
                                  FBI AGENT 1
                        Okay, sir.
 
              The two sliding doors in front of the coroner slide open and
              he wheels the metal surgical cart inside, the door closing
              behind him.
 
 
        14    INT. FBI MORGUE - DAY
 
              The Coroner is in the middle of his autopsy.  He talks into
              a microphone as he works, taking the dismembered parts of
              Jason from a body bag.
 
                                  CORONER
                        We have a large male caucasian...age
                        unknown...
 
              He begins inspecting various organs, weighs them, takes
              samples.  He works methodically, making verbal notes as he
              works.
 
                                  CORONER
                               (continuing)
                        No indication of cirrhosis.
 
              ON JASON'S VILE, BLACK HEART
 
              as the coroner inspects it.
 
                                  CORONER
                        The heart is nearly twice the size of
                        a normal heart.  Malformed...
 
              He's about to lift the heart when...the heart beats!
 
              The coroner stops.  He didn't see that.
 
                                  CORONER
                               (trying to keep his
                                composure)
                        It appears to be filled with a black,
                        viscous fluid...frankly, I don't know
                        what the hell it is.  It's not blood.
 
              The heart beats again!

              The coroner stares, shocked, transfixed.
 
              The heart undulates now as it beats...it is a hypnotic,
              throbbing pulse.  Something that has to be stared at.
              Something that awakens deep, impossible cravings.
 
              It draws the coroner towards it, his eyes glassy, transfixed
              by what he sees.
 
              It beats faster, undulating, a gaping, kneading maw...
 
              The coroner stares, then reaches down and takes the now
              furiously beating heart in his hands.
 
              He looks at it for a frighteningly long beat.  He brings it
              closer to his face.  He would appear to be studying it...
              trying to understand what in God's name this thing is...
 
              And then he suddenly smiles, raises the monstrous organ to
              his lips...
 
              ...and eats the heart of Jason Voorhees!
 
              When he finishes the heart, he stands for a moment, not
              moving.  Then, suddenly, his throat bulges and he begins to
              SCREAM A HORRIBLE SCREAM and, as he SCREAMS we

        15    INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
 
              Dead silence.  Whatever is going on in that room cannot be
              heard through the airtight doors.
 
              The CORONER'S ASSISTANT walks up, carrying dinner.  The two
              FBI MEN stop him.
 
                                  FBI MAN 1
                        I.D.
 
                                  ASSISTANT
                        You just saw me come out of there.
 
                                  FBI MAN 1
                        I.D. please.
 
              Annoyed, fumbling, the assistant takes out his I.D.
 
 
        16    INT.  FBI MORGUE - NIGHT
 
              The assistant walks in to see the Coroner doubled over.

                                  ASSISTANT
                        Hey, what's the matter.
 
              The Coroner straightens, then turns to the assistant.  His
              mouth is smeared with black liquid of the heart.
 
                                  ASSISTANT
                               (continuing)
                        You ate already?  I was only gone ten
                        minutes.
 
              The assistant tosses the food on the counter as the Coroner
              takes
 
              A SHARP DISSECTING PROBE
 
              from off the table and walks over to him.
 
              The Coroner holds the dissecting probe up to the Assistant's
              face.
 
                                  ASSISTANT
                               (continuing)
                        Yes.  That's a probe.
 
              Suddenly, using his other hand, the Coroner
 
              SHOVES HIS INDEX FINGER
 
              up through the soft flesh under the Assistant's jaw hooking
              his finger through the Assistant's mouth and jerking the
              assistant's head down to
 
              SMASH INTO THE METAL EXAMINING TABLE
 
              Then, the Coroner takes the dissecting probe and drives it
              into the back of the Assistant's skull.  The Assistant
              spasms...then goes still.
 
              The Coroner turns and walks to the door, passing by a mirror.
 
              ON THE MIRROR
 
              to see the reflection.  It is not the coroner walking
              by...it's
 
              JASON VOORHEES, HOCKEY MASK IN PLACE!
 
 
        17    INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
 
              The Coroner/Jason strides out of the doors and walks past the
              FBI men.

                                  FBI MAN 1
                        So that's the verdict -- is Jason
                        gonna be getting up and walking
                        around any time soon?
 
              The Coroner/Jason stops and slowly turns back to the two
              smiling FBI men -- there will be doom here very soon.

              ROBERT CAMPBELL.  In his early 30's, he's got T.V. good
              looks.  He speaks in the overly serious "journalese" of
              tabloid television.

                                  CAMPBELL
                        I'm Robert Campbell.  Tonight, on
                        American Casefile, we'll talk, via
                        satellite, to Mr. Creighton Duke --
                        the bounty hunter responsible for the
                        capture of six of this country's most
                        reviled serial killers/
 
              SHOT WIDENS
 
              to include Duke, playing idly with a small dagger.
 
              We recognize him as the man who we saw watching Jason die.
              It's difficult to say how old he is -- it's his life that has
              weathered him, not his years.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Mr. Duke, how can you claim that
                        Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
 
                                  DUKE
                        How many times has Jason been
                        reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Eight times.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Eight times.  They've burned him,
                        dipped him in nuclear waste --
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        -- But this time they bombed him and
                        then cremated the body.
 
                                  DUKE
                        They coulda danced a jig on it an'
                        fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya'
                        can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of
                        his body.  He'll come back the way he
                        always do, to drag the kiddies into
                        the darkness and crush their little
                        skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr.
                        Campbell.
 
              Campbell laughs and smiles winningly.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Well, let's hope not!
 
                                  DUKE
                        Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
 
              A look between the two of them.

                                  CAMPBELL
                        In the media, you've frequently been
                        described as "salty" --
 
                                  DUKE
                        -- look, just shut up.  Let's cut
                        through the shit.  You asked me here
                        because you want me to catch and kill
                        Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it,
                        but it won't be easy...and it won't
                        be cheap.  One hundred grand, non-
                        negotiable.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        I understand.  However, our audience
                        should be aware that you only charged
                        forty thousand dollars to catch the
                        Idaho skin stretcher.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Skin stretcher was human.
 
              Campbell takes a moment to make sure that isn't lost on his
              audience.  Duke leans in close.
 
                                  DUKE
                               (continuing)
                        Let's get one thing straight, Mr.
                        Campbell.  This isn't your garden
                        variety serial killer -- there's only
                        one way to put and end ta' put an'
                        end to Jason Voorhees for all time
                        and I'm the only one that knows the
                        way.  If you want him dead truly
                        dead -- my fee is one hundred grand.
                        You know where to find me.
 
              Duke stands.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to
                        offer you your sum of one hundred
                        thousand dollars, payable only after
                        you provide American Casefile with
                        incontrovertible proof of --
 
                                  DUKE
                        -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have
                        your hundred grand ready.  For that
                        you get the machete...the mask...the

        20    INT. DINER STOCKROOM - DAY
 
              The TV suddenly SNAPS OFF.
 
              REVERSE ANGLE
 
              to see DIANA KIMBLE, leaning back after having just shut it
              off. Sexy, in her early 40's, Diana is a waitress here in
              "Joey B's Diner".  Many people might be disturbed by the
              notion that Jason Voorhees is still alive, but for
              Diana...this means something much more.
 
                                  JOEY B. (O.S.)
                        Hey!  Lady Di!
 
              Diana whirls around to see JOEY B. -- the frightening, no-
              bullshit owner of the diner.  She's a big woman with a big
              attitude.
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        I'm sorry to cut into your TV time,
                        but there's a few customers out here
                        who'd like to eat sometime this
                        fuckin' month.
 
 
        21    INT. JOEY B'S DINER - DAY
 
              "Joey B's Diner" may not be the last place in the world you'd
              want to eat, but it's at least the second to last.  A couple
              of hockey masks hang from the ceiling and a banner proclaiming
              "JASON IS DEAD -- 2 FOR 1 BURGER SALE!" hangs on the far wall.
 
              Diana walks out and looks at this with an amused dismay.
 
                                  DIANA
                        This is truly sick.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Tell me about it.
 
              That comes from VICKI, the other waitress in the diner.
              Early 20's, she's cute and she's tough.  She moves off as
              Joey B. steps up.
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        No, this is not sick, Diana, this is
                        business.  People are gonna come to
                        see Jason's hometown and they're
                        gonna come with appetites.
 
              SHELBY, Joey B.'s husband and cook, leans out the serving
              window.

                                  SHELBY
                        Di -- food's up!

                        Thanks, Shelby.
 
              Besides him, WARD, Shelby and Joey B.'s early 20's son,
              sticks his head out as well.
 
                                  WARD
                        Ma -- you seriously want me to cut
                        these like this?
 
              He holds up a hamburger patty cut into the shape of a hockey
              mask -- oval with punched out eyeholes.
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        Yes I do!
 
                                  WARD
                        They look stupid...
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        Well, that's your dumbass fault --
                        they're supposed to look like hockey
                        masks!  Now watch.
 
              Joey B. quickly cuts a fresh hamburger patty into the
              appropriate shape, then balls up the cut-away meat and holds
              it up in front of Ward.
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        This makes a whole new patty...hence
                        the 2 for 1 burger sale.
 
                                  SHELBY
                        My God, I love this woman.
 
              They kiss.
 
                                  WARD
                        You guys make me sick.
 
              They break apart.  Shelby turns to Diana.
 
                                  SHELBY
                        Table 3, Di.
 
              We follow Diana as she picks up several plates and walks
              towards a table, passing by STEVEN FREEMAN who sits at the
              counter next to his friend RANDY -- a young cop in uniform.

              Steven, early 20's and good-looking, turns to Diana -- what's
              he's about to say is difficult for him but he tries to make
              it seem casual.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Diana -- you heard from Jessica
                        lately?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Yes.
 
              She sets a plate down in front of him and continues walking.
              Randy turns to Steven with a wry smile.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Allright, you're gettin' somewhere...
 
              We follow Diana to the table where JOSH (40's) and SHERIFF
              LANDIS sit.  Diana gives everyone their food as Randy walks
              over and sits down with them.
 
                                  DIANA
                               (to Josh)
                        Burger, side of fries.
                               (to Randy)
                        Double burger, side of rings.
                               (to Sheriff)
                        Meatloaf, side of me.
 
              And she leans forward and plants a kiss on his lips.  Josh
              smiles.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Where the hell was that on the menu?
                        I'd have ordered a couple.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (mock threat)
                        You keep movin' in on my woman and I
                        might have to take you out back and
                        shoot you.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Yeah, I've seen you shoot...
 
              They all smile.  It's a nice moment, until:
 
                                  RANDY
                        I don't know...
                               (baiting him)
                        ...I think you two should just go
                        ahead and get married.
 
              The Sheriff turns to him.

                                  SHERIFF
                        I'm sorry, son, I'm going' a little
                        deaf in my old age...what did you say
                        again?
 
              He stares at Randy fixedly.
 
                                  RANDY
                        I said I think I'll just eat my food
                        over by Steven and shut the hell up.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (to Josh)
                        That's exactly what I thought he said.
 
              Randy smiles and walks over to Steven as the Sheriff turns to
              Diana and affectionately rubs her back.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Everything going okay?
 
                                  DIANA
                        It's going.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Legs giving you trouble?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Not so bad, today.
 
              The Sheriff watches Randy sit back beside Steven.  Steven
              glances over, catches the Sheriff's eye, then quickly turns
              away.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Steven buggin' you?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Do you have to ask?
 
                                  JOSH
                        Jesus, he's relentless.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Let me talk to him, Diana.  I just
                        need three minutes with him.
 
                                  DIANA
                               (warningly)
                        Ed...

                                  SHERIFF
                        Okay.
                               (a beat)
                        So how is Jessica?  You talked to her
                        lately?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Yeah, she's good, considering. That
                        kid just takes everything in stride.
 
                                  JOSH
                               (mumbling into food)
                        Wonder where she got that from...
 
              Diana smiles at him.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I gotta get back to work.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Okay, I'll call you later.
 
              She gives him a quick kiss, then walks off. Josh watches her
              go, then fixes the Sheriff with a knowing stare.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Don't say it...
 
              Josh grins.  He starts HUMMING THE WEDDING BELL MARCH.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (continuing)
                        How about this -- I'll make you a
                        deal...I'll marry Diana when you quit
                        banging Edna and concentrate on your
                        wife.
 
                                  JOSH
                               (shakes his head)
                        Poor, lonely Diana...
 
              ON DIANA
 
              as she arrives at another table.  The customer's face is
              hidden by a menu.
 
                                  DIANA
                        What can I get ya'?
 
                                  MAN
                        I'll take a Voorhees burger and a
                        side of Jason Fingers.

              The man lowers the menu.  It's Duke.  He smiles.  Diana,
              recognizing him, takes a step back.  She recovers quickly.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Anything else?
 
                                  DUKE
                        Yes.
 
              Duke extends his hand.
 
                                  DUKE
                               (continuing)
                        Creighton Duke.
 
              Hesitantly, Diana shakes his hand.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I know who you are.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I need to talk to you.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I'm kind of busy right now...
 
                                  DUKE
                        I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees --
                        and I need you to help me.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Jason Voorhees is dead.
 
                                  DUKE
                        You know he's not...and he's coming
                        for you.
 
                                  DIANA
                        You food'll be right out.
 
              She turns to go.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I'll give you ten thousand dollars.
 
              That stops her.  She turns back.
 
                                  DIANA
                        No, I --
 
                                  DUKE
                        Twenty.

                                  DIANA
                        Look --
 
                                  DUKE
                        Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone
                        has a price, what's yours?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Look, I don't want your money!
 
                                  DUKE
                        Then maybe I should offer it to your
                        daughter...
 
              Diana does not, at any level, like Jessica being brought into
              the conversation.  She leans in close.
 
                                  DIANA
                        What do you want?
 
                                  DUKE
                        You know what I want.  You know why
                        I need you.
 
                                  DIANA
                        You need to leave.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I know everything about you, Diana.
 
                                  DIANA
                        That's it, we're done.
 
              She turns to go.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I know who you really are!
 
              This stops her in her tracks.  Suddenly, we hear:
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        What's the problem here?
 
                                  DIANA
                        N...nothing.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I was just making your girlfriend
                        there a little proposition...she's
                        thinking it over.  Right, luv?
 
              The Sheriff steps forward.

                                  SHERIFF
                        Maybe you should be moving on.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Maybe you should mind your own
                        business.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Get up!
 
                                  DUKE
                        Why don't you blow me, Chief.
                               (a beat)
                        After your girlfriend gets through.
 
              The Sheriff thinks a second -- then, suddenly, he swings at
              Duke.
 
              With surprising speed, Duke's hand darts up, catching the
              Sheriff's fist.  But, with equally surprising speed, Landis
              brings his gun up under the man's chin.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        You're talking about my lady.
 
                                  DUKE
                        She's your lady only cause she ain't
                        had a taste of the Duke yet.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Goddamnit!
 
              He grabs Duke, pulling him up from the table.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Careful, Chief.  I don't think you
                        know who I am.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        I know who you are and the last thing
                        we need around here is some freak
                        show "bounty hunter" making trouble.
                        I want you outta town and I want you
                        outta town now!
 
                                  DUKE
                        That's very colorful, chief.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (to Randy)
                        Take him to my car.  I'll be out in
                        a minute.

                                  RANDY
                        Let's go.
 
                                  DUKE
                        He's comin' for you, Diana...and your
                        daughter.  Lock your doors.
 
              Randy takes Duke away.  The Sheriff turns to Diana, a little
              proud, a little manly.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        I'm sorry if he upset you...
 
              Diana angrily turns to him.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I don't need you to fight my battle.
                        I don't need any part-time protection.
 
              Saying that, she walks off.  The Sheriff glances around at
              the people in the diner then, a little cowed, goes outside.
 
              ON DIANA
 
              as she walks up to the counter where Steven sits.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        He seem to think Jason's...
                               (in Duke's accent)
                        ...comin' fer ya'?
 
              He smiles.  She doesn't.  Vicki walks up.
 
                                  VICKI
                        You okay?
 
              Diana nods.
 
                                  VICKI
                               (continuing)
                        Okay.
 
              Vicki moves off.  When she does, Diana turns to Steven.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Steven, I need to talk to you.
                        There's something you don't know
                        about Jessica, something you should
                        know.  She was going to tell you
                        herself but...
 
              Diana looks up and stares out the window.

              HER POV
 
              One of Joey B's hockey mask spins slowly in her field of
              vision, but instead of looking cheesy...it now seems
              scary...foreboding.  Diana turns back to Steven.
 
                                  DIANA
                        ...but there just may not be enough
                        time.  If you still care about her,
                        if you still want to try to make
                        things better between you two...we
                        should talk.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        So let's talk.
 
                                  DIANA
                        No.  Not here.  Come by my house
                        tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
 
              As Steven looks at her worried face, we
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        22    EXT. JOEY B'S DINER - NIGHT
 
              Diana comes out the back door of the diner, taking the
              garbage out.
 
              POV SHOT
 
              slowly moving in on her, stalking.  There shadows, the dark
              gaps of night and woods between her and the trash...we just
              know that she is going to die.
 
              ON THE DUMPSTER
 
              as Diana approaches it.  She flings it open with a LOUD BANG
              then dumps the trash in.  We stay close...sure she is going
              into that dumpster with her trash...
 
              But no...she finishes and turns...
 
              ...Right into Josh!
 
                                  DIANA
                        Jesus!
 
                                  JOSH
                        Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my
                        car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...

                                  DIANA
                        It's...It's all right.
 
              Josh takes the trash can from her...carries it back towards
              the diner.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Listen...don't you worry about Ed.
                        He'll come around.  He's too good a
                        Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I'm just too old for going steady,
                        Josh.
 
                                  JOSH
                        So's he and he knows it.
 
              They've reached the diner.  He opens the door for her.
 
                                  JOSH
                               (continuing)
                        Everything'll work out.  Trust me on
                        that.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Okay.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Good night, beautiful.
 
                                  DIANA
                        'Night, Josh.
 
              She gives him a quick hug, then closes the diner door, going
              back inside to clean up.
 
              Josh steps off the porch and around back to the parking lot.
 
              STALKER'S POV
 
              following him, moving in, closer...
 
              IN THE PARKING LOT
 
              EDNA steps out of her car as Josh approaches.  She's an
              attractive woman around Josh's age.  He smiles and moves to
              kiss her.  She stops him.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Not here.
 
              She looks around nervously.

                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        Sorry I'm late.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Bill didn't go bowling at the regular
                        time?
 
                                  EDNA
                        The League changed the damn
                        time...but we've still got 'til ten-
                        thirty.  Hop in.
 
              Josh smiles and hurries to the passenger side of the car as
              Edna climbs back in behind the wheel.
 
              STALKER'S POV
 
              Suddenly rushing towards the car, smashing into the driver's
              door, slamming it shut with tremendous force just as Edna's
              head is lowered to enter.
 
              She is dead.
 
              STALKER'S POV
 
              Turns to Josh who stands frozen in absolute terror.
 
              POV RUSHES AT HIM
 
              as we --
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              BLACK, then slowly
 
              FADE UP ON:
 
 
        23    INT. VOORHEES HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT
 
              CLOSE ON JOSH
 
              Strapped on a metal table.  Straps across his body.  Even a
              strap to hold his head firmly in place.  FIRELIGHT dances
              across his apparently nude body and his terror-stricken eyes.
              His terror grows as a shadow leans in to cover his face.
 
              ON THE CORONER/JOSH
 
              As he looks down at Josh.  It is the coroner we see, but his
              eyes are those black empty pools of Jason's evil.  Many large
              sores cover the man's face.

              Even as we watch, another seems to push its way forth from
              the skin.  Clearly, they weaken the man.  He sways slightly.
              Catches his balance... and raises something into view.  A
              STRANGER RAZOR.
 
              ON JOSH
 
              As he begins to whimper.  The man lowers the razor towards
              his face.  The blade glints in the firelight as the
              Coroner/Jason brings it down, closer... closer... until its
              sharp edge touches Josh's skin.  Then, suddenly,
 
              The man begins to give Josh a shave!
 
              The SCRAPE of the razor is loud against Josh's unlathered
              moustache.
 
              Now the cornoner/Jason moves the blade across Josh's Adam's
              apple... carefully, expertly.
 
              When the man is finished, there is a long, uncertain beat,
              then his hands bring a hot towel into view.
 
              JOSH'S POV
 
              As the towel is laid over his face.
 
              BLACKNESS
 
              Over which we hear the STRANGLED SOUNDS of the Coroner/Jason
              breathing -- what the hell is he doing?  After a long moment,
              the towel is lifted and, still in
 
              JOSH'S POV
 
              We see the coroner/Jason lean in, opening his mouth wide,
              until his face fills the screen.
 
              A beat, then Josh SCREAMS a horrible SCREAM as we
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        24    EXT. VOORHEES HOUSE - NIGHT
 
              There is a dark and evil aura to the house, but it is not the
              Victorian haunted house of some storybook tale of ghosts.  This
              a place built as a summer home in the forties... abandoned many
              years ago... it looks now as if it is dissolving slowly back
              into the small, encroaching corner of the lake behind it and
              into the woods around it.
 
              But the sense of evil doesn't come from the rot or the
              decay... those are just symptoms.

              The sense of evil comes from the core of darkness that we can
              feel in every gaping window.  In every shadow.  In the dark
              shadows of the trees and the darker waters of the lake.
 
              As Josh continues to SCREAM, we
 
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
 
 
        25    INT. DINER - NIGHT
 
              Steven and Randy sit by the counter, Vicki stands beside them
              and we can see Ward back in the kitchen, cooking up some food.
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (to Vicki)
                        What do you mean you've never made a
                        prank call?
 
                                  VICKI
                        Never.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        You mean never as in really never, or
                        never as in it was just so stupid you
                        don't want to tell us about it?
 
                                  VICKI
                        I mean really never.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man
                        once said -- there is no worse regret
                        then a temptation resisted.
 
              A beat.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really
                        lovely.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I mean, how can you go through life
                        without never having made a prank
                        call?
 
                                  RANDY
                        Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was
                        like, having strippers delivered to
                        church Bingos and shit.
 
                                  VICKI
                        That's disgusting.

                                  STEVEN
                        Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out
                        for six months after that!  They
                        raised enough money to build a day
                        care center.
 
                                  RANDY
                        It was a community service.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Absolutely.  The church even sent me
                        an autographed picture of God.
                               (yelling to the back)
                        Ward!
 
                                  WARD
                               (shouting from back)
                        Yeah!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        You ever make a prank call?
 
                                  WARD
                        I called an adoption agency once when
                        I was like nine or something and I
                        told them I wanted to trade my mom in
                        for a box of Lincoln Logs.
 
              Suddenly, a wet sponge comes flying in from offscreen and
              hits Ward in the face.
 
                                  JOEY B. (O.S.)
                        Why don't you shut the fuck up and
                        cook those burgers?!
 
                                  WARD
                        I really wanted those fuckin' Logs.
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              As he gets up and walks over to the pay phone in the diner.
 
                                  RANDY
                        What are you doing?
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Showing Vicki what she missed out on
                        by being such a dull kid.  Now, the
                        first thing you need in making a
                        prank call is, of course, a phone.
                               (holds up the phone)
                        This one, for instance.

                                  RANDY
                        Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Next, you dial a number.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Really, Steven, I don't want you to
                        do this...
 
              Steven dials a number.
 
              CLOSE ON
 
              The receiver to see Steven click it off out of view of the
              others.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        ...and it's now ringing...ringing...
                        and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria?
                        Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker
                        over at the station.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just
                        have one question for you, Anthony --
                        did you fuck my dog?
 
                                  RANDY
                        Oh my God, Steven.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if
                        I find out it was you, I'm gonna come
                        over there and shoot you in the head.
 
                                  RANDY
                        I'm now begging you.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Listen, since I got you on the
                        phone -- ask the guys there if they
                        wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll
                        send her right over.  Her name is
                        Vicki.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Steven!

                                  STEVEN
                        She's a waitress at Joey B's but she
                        needs some extra cash.  Ward's the
                        pimp.
 
                                  VICKI
                        I'm literally going to kill you!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to
                        you -- you can have her for a pizza.
 
                                  VICKI
                        A pizza?!
 
              Suddenly, Randy walks up to Steven and quickly handcuffs him
              to the metal phone cord.
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (to Randy)
                        Randy, what the fuck?  Take these off!
 
              Wards sets two paper bags down on the counter.
 
                                  WARD
                               (to Randy)
                        Food's ready.  Tell the guys at the
                        station the pimp says hi.
 
                                  RANDY
                               (taking food)
                        Sure thing.  See ya', Steven.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
 
                                  RANDY
                        Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I
                        have a job...
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Randy, c'mon!
 
                                  RANDY
                        Have a good night.
 
              The Steven glances at the clock -- 11:10.  He was supposed to
              meet Diana ten minutes ago.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Ah, shit.
 
              With startling speed, Steven pops off the cuff on his wrist,
              hangs up, then turns to Randy waving his free wrist.

                                  STEVEN
                        Wanna know how I did that?
 
                                  RANDY
                        Yeah...
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (Steven smiles)
                        Gotta go.  See you guys later.
 
              He runs past Randy to the door of the diner, then stops and
              turns to him.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        By the way, if you'd been paying
                        attention you'd have noticed I held
                        the receiver down when I dialed --
                        cop like you should be more observant
                        than that.
 
              And he rushes out of the diner.
 
                                  RANDY
                        He drives me so fucking crazy.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        26    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              In the darkness, the phone RINGS.  A key turns in the door as
              Diana enters.  She finds the light switch as the phone RINGS
              again.
 
              The lights come on and she dashes across the room to answer
              the phone.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Coming!  Hold on!
 
              She snatches the phone.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Hello...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (from the phone)
                        June the 19th.
 
              Diana thinks a second trying to place the caller...then
              suddenly smiles.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Ed...

              Behind Diana, a shadowy figure appears in the doorway.  We
              see him as he moves forward, but Diana doesn't.
 
 
        27    INT. LANDIS' SQUAD CAR - NIGHT
 
              He's in his car, talking on the phone.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        That's when my vacation starts.  If
                        we get married then, we'll have two
                        weeks in Hawaii.
                               (a beat)
                        I love you, Diana.  I'm sorry I've
                        waited this long.  Let's do it.
 
 
        28    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              Diana is as happy as she's ever been.  The man (who we now
              recognize as Josh) is still approaching from the shadows.
 
                                  DIANA
                        God, Ed, I love you too, I...
 
              Now directly behind Diana, Josh snakes a hand out, snatches
              the receiver from her then slams it back into its cradle.
 
              Diana only ha time for a STARTLED GASP as Josh grabs her.  He
              takes her head in a firm embrace and draws her face close to
              his.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Josh!  What are you doing!
 
              His lips draw closer and closer to hers.  His eyes are cold,
              empty places.
 
              She turns her head to the side, away from Josh.  Her eyes
              open in a terror born of absolute disbelief and a certain
              knowledge that, except for the pain, she is already dead.
 
              DIANA'S POV
 
              On the mirror over the mantle.  In the reflection she sees
              not Josh, but Jason Voorhees, mask in place.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Oh God...Oh Jesus...

              ON JOSH/JASON
 
              As he reaches out to Diana, turns her head back to his and
              opens his mouth -- it's dank and vile and there's something
              in there, something that writhes horribly, the same oozing
              color as Jason's dark heart.
 
              As the thing squirms out from between his teeth and towards
              Diana's lips, she manages to screams last:
 
                                  DIANA
                        No!
 
              Panicked, determined, she reaches down and opens the drawer
              of the phone table.
 
              Inside is a service revolver.
 
              The phone begins to RING AGAIN as Diana grabs the gun and
              sticks it against Josh's temple as the black thing in his
              mouth begins to pry her lips apart, trying to worm inside.
 
              She pulls the trigger.
 
              The SHOT RINGS LOUD in the room.  Josh/Jason staggers back,
              falls to his knees. He's been shot in the back of the head at
              close range -- it's a wound that would kill anyone human.
 
              The phone CONTINUES TO RING, until it is knocked off it's
              cradle by Diana as she turns and runs to the patio door.
 
              It's locked.
 
              She fiddles with it, trying to open it, then glances back to
              make sure Josh/Jason isn't coming for her.
 
              Josh/Jason isn't there.
 
              Oh, shit.  She back against a wall, looking around -- where
              is he?  She turns.  He's not there.  She spots the phone and
              moves towards it.
 
              Then, from the darkness of the shadows...
 
              ...Josh/Jason leaps out at her, grabs her and flings her down
              to the floor.
 
              The injured, but very obviously alive Josh/Jason holds
              Diana's head firmly against the carpet.  He lowers his mouth
              towards hers and, once again, that black thing in his mouth
              squirms through his lips.  The phone keeps RINGING and
              RINGING...

              Suddenly, the room is bathed in light as a car pulls up
              outside.
 
 
        29    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
 
              Steven enters.  He sees blood and, hearing Diana SCREAM,
              rushes into
 
 
        30    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              and leaps on Josh, his momentum knocking the man off Diana
              before Josh can force the horrible, squirming thing from his
              mouth into hers -- but the advantage is just momentary.
 
              Josh/Jason turns to Steven and grabs him by his shirt,
              picking him up off the ground with what is clearly superhuman
              strength and throws him against the nearest wall.
 
              Steven hits the wall with a sharp, nearly back-breaking
              impact.  He lies for a moment, stunned, near unconsciousness,
              then he regains his bearings just in time to see Josh/Jason
              taking a knife sharpening pole from the knife rack next to
              him in the kitchen.
 
              Then Josh/Jason turns and flings the instrument through the
              air at Steven just as Diana runs up to see if Steven's okay.
 
              The pole pierces Diana through the back.
 
              She looks up at Steven with a stunned expression and then
              sinks down to the floor revealing Josh/Jason behind her.
 
              There is a fury in him now that is terrible to behold.  An
              unearthly SCREAM of frustration and rage tears from his
              throat.  His hands reach out, ready to tear into Steven.
 
              Steven manages to duck, roll and come up beside the fireplace.
 
              Josh/Jason turns and charges at Steven.
 
              Steven grabs a fireplace poker and rams it with all of his
              strength through Josh/Jason's chest.
 
              As he does this, he is positioned so that he can't help but
              see the reflection in the mirror.  He sees Jason Voorhees
              struggling furiously... trying to pull the poker out of his
              chest.  In trying to do that, Josh/Jason is thrown backward.
 
              He crashes through a window and falls outside.
 
              Steven rushes back to Diana.  He bends, taking her in his
              arms.

                                  DIANA
                               (weakly)
                        You saw him?  You know who he is?
 
              Steven nods.
 
                                  DIANA
                               (continuing)
                        You have to...save...Jessica... Save
                        Jessica and save the...
 
                                  STEVEN
                        The what?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Save your...
 
              But the pain is too much.
 
                                  DIANA
                               (continuing)
                        Steven...
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I'm here.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
 
              All Steven can do is hold her.  Her eyes close.  She dies.
 
                                  SHERIFF (O.S.)
                        Oh, God Almighty, no...
 
              ON SHERIFF
 
              Standing there, staring, in shock.  He pulls his gun.
 
              As he does this, Steven sets Diana down and runs towards the
              window.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        It was Josh.  He fell outside.  He --
 
              Steven looks out the window.
 
              STEVEN'S POV
 
              There is nothing there but darkness.  Josh/Jason is gone.
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              As he turns back to SHERIFF. The man kneels by Diana.

                                  SHERIFF
                        Oh, my dear God...
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (really to himself)
                        He was dead.  He had to be dead...
 
              SHERIFF looks up at Steven.
 
              The boy stands covered in blood.  Suddenly, he realizes what
              this must look like.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        No... you can't think I...
 
              But SHERIFF's eyes grow cold.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Let's go.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        31    INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
 
              Steven is in this dismal interrogation room.  He's tired,
              frightened, angry.  We don't know how long he's been here,
              but it's clearly been a long time.  SHERIFF and Steven's
              friend, Randy, are in the room with him.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        How many times do you want to hear
                        this?
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Until I hear the truth.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I've told you the truth.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        The truth?  That Josh, a man I've
                        trusted with my own life on more than
                        one occasion -- let me see if I've
                        got the order right here -- tried to
                        rape Diana...got the back of his head
                        blown off...took a poker through the
                        gut...fell through a plate glass
                        window and then magically disappeared
                        into the night.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I know what it sounds like.

                                  SHERIFF
                        You don't know shit!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I didn't kill her!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Then why were you at her house?!  She
                        didn't want anything to do with you.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        She asked me to come over.  She said
                        she had something to tell me.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        About what?
 
                                  STEVEN
                        About Jessica.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        That's a lie.  Diana would never talk
                        to you about Jessica.  Not after what
                        you did to her.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Look, I know I treated her bad --
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        -- Bad?!
 
              SHERIFF suddenly hauls off, WHACKS STEVEN ACROSS THE FACE
              then grabs him by the collar and pulls him close.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (continuing)
                        You call what you did bad?!  You
                        knocked her up and then left her!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        No -- she left me!  After her
                        miscarriage, I --
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        -- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told
                        you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        She did!
 
              SHERIFF looks at Steven with an almost astonished pity.

                                  SHERIFF
                        My God...you are one sorry son-of-a-
                        bitch.
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (a little frantic)
                        She did have a miscarriage, didn't
                        she?  Didn't she?!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a-
                        bitch...
 
              Defeated, eyes filled with loss and anger, SHERIFF turns and
              walks away.  Then, just before he exits, he turns back.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (continuing)
                        If I wasn't the Sheriff here, if I
                        thought I could get away with it...
                        I would kill you right now.  That's
                        no exaggeration.
                               (to Randy)
                        I'll be back.
 
              The Sheriff leaves.
 
              Steven watches him go, then turns to Randy who can't quite
              bring himself to meet Steven's steady gaze.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Do you believe me?
 
              Randy has to think about this.  Finally:
 
                                  RANDY
                        I don't believe that you murdered
                        Diana.  I don't know what really
                        happened, but I know you couldn't
                        have done it.
 
              Steven nods -- that's going to have to be enough for now.
 
                                  RANDY
                               (continuing)
                        You just sit tight -- I'm gonna take
                        care of this.  I'll straighten
                        everything out.
 
              Steven SIGHS, then closes his eyes and rubs them.

                                  STEVEN
                        Jesus, Randy...
                               (looks up at Randy)
                        ...what is Jessica gonna do?
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        32    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN
 
              Early morning light filters through the windows.  The door
              opens and JESSICA KIMBLE enters.  She's in her early twenties,
              a strikingly beautiful image of her mother.  There is a
              startled GASP.
 
              ON VICKI
 
              The young waitress who worked with Diana at the diner.  She's
              trying to clean the bloodstains off the floor and the
              furniture.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted
                        to have this cleaned up before you
                        got here.
 
                                  JESSICA
                        That's all right.  I was just...
 
              Jessica fights it, trying not to cry.
 
              Vicki gets up, wiping her hands on her overalls, and walks
              over to her friend and hugs her.
 
                                  JESSICA
                               (continuing)
                        Oh, God, Vick...
 
              They hold each other.  Suddenly, we hear a BABY CRYING.
              Startled, Vicki looks over Jessica's shoulder and sees a baby
              carriage, standing just outside the door.
 
              Vicki moves to the carriage and picks up the baby, who
              immediately STOPS CRYING.
 
                                  VICKI
                        A girl?
 
              Jessica nods.
 
                                  VICKI
                        She's beautiful.

                                  JESSICA
                        Her name's Stephanie.
 
                                  VICKI
                        She's yours?
 
              Jessica nods.  A beat.
 
                                  VICKI
                        She has Steven's eyes.
 
              She smiles from the baby to Jessica, looking for confirmation.
              Jessica gives a little, reluctant nod.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Why didn't you tell me?
 
                                  JESSICA
                        I was going to, I was going to tell
                        everyone.  I just...didn't expect to
                        be back here so soon.
                               (a beat)
                        Is Steven around?
 
              Vicki nods.
 
                                  JESSICA
                               (continuing)
                        Does he know about what happened?
 
                                  VICKI
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Sit down a second.  There's something
                        I need to tell you about Steven...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        33    INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN
 
              Steven is sitting alone, waiting to discover his fate.
              Suddenly the door opens and Randy walks in.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Well?
 
                                  RANDY
                        I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a
                        cell.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Are you crazy?!

                                  RANDY
                        I know, I know, I'm sorry but the
                        Sheriff is just berserk right now.
                        C'mon.
 
 
        34    INT. MAIN ROOM OF POLICE STATION - DAWN
 
              Randy leads Steven from the interrogation room towards the
              jail cell block.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Hopefully we won't have to hold you
                        more than a day.  I'm gonna bust my
                        ass to prove you innocent but you
                        gotta be cool or Landis will really
                        kil you, okay?  Okay?
 
              Steven has not been paying attention -- he's staring at
              something on the other side of the room.
 
              HIS POV
 
              Jessica enters through the front door with Vicki.
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              In his eyes we see that, in spite of whatever might have
              happened in the past, he really loves this girl.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        ...Jessica...
 
              ON JESSICA
 
              As she suddenly turns and lifts something up into view -- the
              baby.
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              As his eyes widen, realizing what this means, what it was
              that Diana was going to tell him, what Landis meant by his
              talk about a "miscarriage".
 
              This is his daughter he's looking at.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        My God...
 
              Suddenly another man comes through the police station door
              and places his hands protectively on Jessica's shoulders.
              She turns away from Steven and looks at this new arrival.
 
              It's Robert Campbell, the host of "American Casefile".

              He and Steven each eye each other...instant enemies.
 
              Suddenly, Randy jerks Steven away towards the cell block.
 
                                  RANDY
                        C'mon.
 
 
        35    INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              As Randy SLAMS THE CELL DOOR in front of him, locking him in.
 
                                  RANDY
                        I'll be back later.  You just be
                        cool, okay.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Okay.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Don't do anything stupid.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up
                        in a friggin' cell?!
 
                                  RANDY
                        I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just
                        hang tight.  Okay?
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Okay.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        36    INT. LANDIS' OFFICE - DAY
 
              The Sheriff is working at his desk when there's a KNOCK AT
              THE DOOR.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Yeah?
 
              The door opens and Jessica (carrying her baby), Vicki and
              Robert enter.  The Sheriff immediately jumps up and hugs
              Jessica tightly.  He says nothing -- there's nothing to say.
              Finally, when they break:
 
                                  JESSICA
                        Ed...I'd like you to meet my
                        boyfriend, Robert Campbell.

                                  LANDIS
                        Ed Landis.
 
              They shake hands.
 
                                  LANDIS
                        I've seen your show.  I like it about
                        as much as I like anything on the
                        television.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Thank you.
 
                                  LANDIS
                        I hope you're not down here on
                        business.  I wouldn't take kindly to
                        seeing Diana's face on one of your
                        programs.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                               (an arm around Jessica)
                        No, sir.  I'm just here for Jess...
 
              Landis nods, apparently satisfied.  He looks at Jessica's
              baby.
 
                                  LANDIS
                        He's a cute little fella.
 
                                  JESSICA
                        He's a she.
 
                                  LANDIS
                               (without missing a beat)
                        And as pretty as her mamma...and her
                        mamma before that...
 
              A sad beat of silence.  Suddenly, the INTERCOM BUZZES.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Yeah?
 
                                  OFFICER DILL (O.S.)
                               (over intercom)
                        Sheriff, we, uh, we have a problem
                        with Diana Kimble's body...
 
              The Sheriff immediately snatches up the phone so he can talk
              privately.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        What's the problem?

              There is a pause as the Sheriff listens and we can tell from
              his face that whatever the problem is...it's serious.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Bring him here.  I wanna talk to him.
 
              The Sheriff hangs up the phone.
 
                                  JESSICA
                        What's the matter?
 
              The Sheriff smiles disarmingly.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Ah, the funeral home just has a
                        couple questions.  Wait here, I'll be
                        back in a minute.
 
 
        37    INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY
 
              The Sheriff storms down this hallway in a fury.  At the other
              end we see Creighton Duke, in cuffs, walking towards him with
              OFFICER DILL slightly behind, trying to keep up.
 
              Finally, the Sheriff and Duke get nose to nose.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
 
                                  DUKE
                        That's what I'd like to know.
 
                                  OFFICER DILL
                        We found him in the morgue.  The body
                        was missing and he was standing over
                        the open cabinet.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (to Duke)
                        What the hell were you doing there?!
 
                                  DUKE
                               (matter-of-factly)
                        Trying to steal the body, obviously...
                        but you fucked up and let someone get
                        to it before I could.
 
              The Sheriff can barely contain himself upon hearing this. He
              tries to calm down, but it's an effort.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Why did you want her body?

                                  DUKE
                        For a good reason.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Tell me.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Sorry.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Tell me!
 
                                  DUKE
                        Information like that is very
                        expensive and you don't have the
                        balls to pay the price.
 
              The Sheriff turns to Officer Dill.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Lock this asshole up.
 
                                  DUKE
                        You think you can lock me up in this
                        piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is
                        motel fuckin' six to me.
 
                                  OFFICER DILL
                        Shut-up.
 
                                  DUKE
                               (to Sheriff)
                        You better find that body right away
                        you incompetant dickhead because if
                        it's where I think it is...you're
                        gonna be in world of shit.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (to Officer Dill)
                        Lock him the fuck up and after you
                        do, I want you to find that body --
                        do you understand me!  I don't care
                        what you have to do, I don't care
                        where you have to go, FIND IT!
 
 
        38    INT. LANDIS' OFFICE - DAY
 
              Landis enters with a pleasant smile on his face.
 
                                  JESSICA
                        What's going on?

                                  SHERIFF
                        Aw, nothing.  It's taken care of.
 
                                  ROBERT
                        Everything's okay, then?
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (sharply)
                        Yes, everything's okay.
