EXT. AIRCRAFT - NIGHT 1

A 727 jet airliner THUNDERS through a STORM RIDDEN night
sky. Rain showers the aircraft as the occasional FLASH of opTiLAL
lightning illuminates the plane's red and green markings. ony

INT. AIRCRAFT - NIGHT 2 4

CLOSE ON an eighteen year-old kid named JOHN. He sits

balled up in a tight window seat in economy class. His face
betrays a map of anxieties, an expression better suited toa
middle-aged neurotic. He seems uncomfortable and nervous. We
PULL BACK to REVEAL why. He's sitting next to a sweating, three
hundred and fifty pound WOMAN in a polyester pant-suit.

John barely has enough room to cross his arms. A STEWARDESS
walks by and John flags her down.

JOHN
Excuse me...miss?

The plane is ROCKED by sudden TURBULENCE. John winces as the
stewardess attends to him.

STEWARDESS
Yes?

JOHN
Can I have a different seat?

STEWARDESS
I'm afraid we're full tonight sir...

ON THE REST OF THE CABIN - Every single seat on the plane is
occupied.

STEWARDESS (CONT. )
».you'll have to stay put.

On JOHN as he blanches as the plane rocks under another
wave of turbulence.

JOHN
(smiles weakly)
Thanks anyway.

The fat woman next.to°him flips on her reading light, it hits
John squarely in the, eye. As he turns his head away he sees
water dripping in from above his window. A small trickle. He
might have forgotten about it if it weren't for the SOUND he
HEARS a second later. A FAINT BENDING NOISE.

. JOHN
(to fat. woman,
“ alarmed)

Did you hear that?

He looks over to her. She looks up from her magazine and shoots
him a contemptuous glance.

JOHN (CONT. )
I hate heights.

FAT WOMAN
Don't be a pussy.

She buries her face back into the magazine. John fearfully
looks back at the leak above his window. He HEARS the NOISE
again. It SOUNDS like METAL FATIGUE. The roof above his head
starts to vibrate. It RUMBLES. The NOISE gets LOUDER. John
looks around, trying to call the stewardess. He hits his call
button. No response.

A sad-faced little GIRL pushes her face up from the seat in
front of him and turns to face John. Brown hair, red-ribbon *
pigtails. She startles him.

GIRL
(to John)
He's gonna make you help *
him...because you're the last.

John stares at her. He smiles weakly. Then signals the
stewardess again.

JOHN
(to stewardess) *
Listen, I really need to change
this seat.

INT. AIRCRAFT - NIGHT

Suddenly, the cabin ceiling above the fat woman RIPS OPEN.
Sending the woman next to John, UP AND OUT of the plane. Sparks
fly as the wind pushes itself through the rapidly decompressing
cabin.
JOHN
(talking to the sky)
It’s not fair! I was almost out!

The seat beneath John suddenly gives way and he’s SUCKED through
the underside of the plane.

John FALLS through the air, hurtling toward the city below. His
descent continues until he meets the roof of a house.

Cur TO:
INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

John awakes with a SCREAM. It was a dream. He looks around, a
simple teen’s bedroom.

Cautiously, he steps out of bed and moves toward the bedroom
window. He moves the curtains enough to UNDO the simple window
latch.

John OPENS the window and PEERS out. A gust of wind HITS him and
he SEES. A look of surprise crosses his face.

JOHN
(yells)
Shit!

The house is FLYING. John sees the city below, with spotlights
searching the empty sky.

Suddenly, the bedroom begins SHAKING. The other windows in the
room EXPLODE. John struggles to keep his balance. Dressers and
lamps CRASH to the floor.

We've seen this scene before. The Wizard Of 02.

As John regains balance, a CACKLE can be HEARD over the wind.
John PEERS out into the windy night sky.

MOVING into view is: FREDDY KRUEGER
RIDING a broomstick, and wearing a witch hat with cape.
FREDDY
(having fun)
I’1l get you my pretty, and your little soul
too! HAHAHAHA!
Freddy LAUGHS as he RIDES out of view.

The house continues its fall, hurtling to the ground, it makes
contact. John is THROWN out of the open window.

EXT. ELM STREET, SPRINGWOOD - NIGHT

The house has landed in the middle of Elm Street. John lands on
the pavement extremely shaken up and confused. The full moon
casts the long shadow of a street sign over him. He clears his
head enough to look around. He's standing directly under the
"ELM STREET" street sign. .

He lands with a WHUMP! and starts rolling down the hill,

He finally comes to a stop at the hill's bottom and attempts to
get to his feet. He wobbles a few times but clears his head
and starts running.

John reaches the "dream border" of Springwood, a desert

landscape with a pond that seems to stretch out into infinity.

The border is marked by a rather bizarre town sign.

ON THE SIGN - A rusty and faded 1950's affair featuring a happy
face with a rusty tear coming out of one eye. We notice that
its population number has been crossed out and rewritten into a
lower number many times.

ON JOHN as he passes it. He sees where the glow is coming from.

There's a small ticket booth of to the side. It says, simply,
"Tickets".

JOHN'S POV of a monster "nightmare bus" coming at him at top
speed. It's Freddy's own nightmare bus-line, complete with the
logo of a frightened, running teen on the side instead of a
racing greyhound.

ON THE BUS as it smashes into John. His SCREAM is cut off by a
LOUD SMACK as the bus' grill makes contact. We REVEAL that
Freddy's behind the wheel!

FREDDY
No screaming while the bus is in *
motion!!!

We MOVE DOWN to John, who is plastered across the bus like a
bug on a windshield, but alive and SCREAMING! The bus suddenly
STOPS SHORT, sending John flying off it's front. He flies
forward and SMASHES through an invisible barrier, which
SHATTERS like glass. We can see through the smoking outline in
the shape of John's body, left in the invisible barrier. It
looks like something out of a "Road Runner" cartoon. There's a
whole new landscape beyond the barrier. We can see a city.

John is on the ground, head next to a rock that's red with his

wakes up, this time for real, in pain. He's still clad only in
jeans. He stands up. He sees the skyline of a city in the
distance.

He looks off towards Springwood. He sees the town sign.

As he stares at it. He seems confused. He puts his hand to his
head. He checks his pockets for some clue to where he is...or
who he is. All he comes up with is two twenty dollar bills, a
bottle of “STAY AWAKE" caffeine pills, and a yellowed old
newspaper clipping. He stares at the clipping and the bottle of
pills for a beat, then puts them back in his pocket. He heads
toward the city. *

We're in a different kind of dream than the one we just saw.
This one is lush, bright, happy.

ON A WATER TOWER serene against the blue sky. We can see it
over the backyard fence.

ON A LITTLE GIRL - We notice it's the same little girl from
John's plane nightmare. Only here she seems joyful.

WE PULL BACK and REVEAL the yard. The fence surrounding it is
tall. We see the girl running in between two sets of adult
legs. A man's and a woman's. They're playing tag. The woman's
legs walk off.

We never see above their waists. This is from the child's point
of view. The child's LAUGHING, having a great time. The man
starts to bend down and lift her up. Just as he does, before we
can see him, there's a HORRIBLE SCREAM!!! The little girl
turns, and the dream FADES OUT.

before his ex-jock DAD. Spencer's a poor little rich kid.
Having run away from home once too often, the shelter is his

last stop. Dad obviously has money, he's dressed in the latest
fashions.

DAD
Spencer, I want to make sure you

Maggie and John walk towards the school, striding up the middle
of a deserted street. Maggie suddenly stops.

ON MAGGIE as she looks down towards her feet. She's noticed
something. John comes over.

JOHN
Why'd you stop?

MAGGIE
(points down)
Look.

ON THE GROUND beneath their feet. Someone's been coloring on
the street. Maggie and John are standing on top of a huge chalk
drawing. We're too close to it to make out what it is.

We PULL UP and the drawing is REVEALED. It's a child's
rendering of Freddy Krueger, complete with claw and fedora.
Sketched in colorful strokes by what had to be many children
working at once. Under the illustration, they also scrawled the
legend, "ONE TWO FREDDY'S COMING FOR You."

~

Maggie and John walk through a rusty schoolyard. Playing fields
overgrown with weeds and grass.

John spots some graffiti on a wall. It's a heart with two names
drawn in it. It reads "GLEN LOVES NANCY." A silent declaration
from two lovers long since gone.

John stares at it, waiting for it to trigger some memory. It
doesn't. He moves away, and sees a large red-brown stain on the
ground below him. Blood was spilled here, a long time ago.

ON MAGGIE as she approaches the front doors to the school. A
weathered sign proclaims this structure to be "SPRINGWOOD HIGH
SCHOOL." The sign has been spray-painted over, and something
has been written over it. "THREE FOUR BETTER LOCK YOUR DOOR."
Maggie stares at the strange rhyme. John joins her’.

INT. HIGHSCHOOL CLASSROOM - DUSK 79

A steady MURMURING has brought John and Maggie to this *
classroom. Like most things in this town, the classroom is a
twisted ghost of its former self. Something ordinary, now

taken to an extraordinary extreme. As Maggie and John enter,

we REVEAL SYKES. He was a teacher once, but now all his

students are gone, as is most of his mind. His suit doesn't

look too well either. He has thick glasses that have fallen
half-way down his nose. A huge pencil holder weighs down the
pocket of his stained shirt. He's at the chipped blackboard,
furiously writing something. Chalk dust flies into his hair.

SYKES (CONT. )
(without turning around)
You'll all be expected to pass both a written
and oral exam...

John and Maggie look around. The class is empty, save for two . *
seats, each behind a rusty desk.

MAGGIE
- (whispers to John)
Don't disturb him...

One of the desks has a thick volume on it. Maggie moves
towards it, she starts flipping through it.

SYKES
(still writing)
You're going to need to study this...

John watches as Sykes suddenly pulls down a weird map of
Springwood, complete with things like “dream border” and
murder sites marked off. Scribbled over the map is “FIVE SIX
GRAB YOUR CRUCIFIX." Maggie snaps John out of it.

MAGGIE
Well, you were here.

John’s article fits perfectly into a hole torn out of the *
volume's page. This is where he got the clipping.

EXT. ELM STREET - NIGHT

That's right. Elm Street. The supreme “bad place” of the
universe. A street that ranks right there with “The Flying
Dutchman”, and “The Bermuda Triangle”. The street that makes “The
Amityville Horror” look like a Long Island Tupperware party.

Tracy, Spencer, and Carlos cross right under the “Zlm Street”
street sign. They walk down the wasted avenue, passing burned out
houses with crooked “FOR SALE” signs planted on their rotted
lawns.

Tracy stops them in front of one particular house.

‘TRACY
(looking o.s.)
This is the one. We’1l have it all to

slightly run down but harmless abandoned house.

The lesson continues. Everything you ever wanted to know

of bad nerves. A pair of cheap sunglasses cover his eyes. He

Freddy smiles, as he starts to get up. Doc's SCREAMING in the
background.

Maggie, don't !
Freddy gets up, licking his lips and smiling. He thinks Maggie *
bought it. He practically LUNGES for the glove but Maggie
surprises him by WHAPPING him with it, HARD! She didn't buy *
any of it!
MAGGIE

(freaks out)
Like you took care of my mother!?

PUNCH!

Freddy is now back to his burned self, he was only playing

FREDDY
You need a good spanking...

TRACY
Maggie!

Maggie turns and Tracy tosses her the pipe-bomb! Maggie sticks
it in the glove. She turns around just in time to see Freddy
coming in for the kill. She reaches out and PLUNGES THE GLOVE
with the bomb DEEP into Freddy's chest. He goes down.

MAGGIE
Happy Father's Day!

Freddy sinks to the floor, blood gurgles from his mouth. Maggie
finds the keys to the weapons room and lets Doc and Tracy out.
They head for the stairs.

Freddy is trying to pull the glove out. Too late.

PREDDY
(grumbling)
Kids.

BOOM!!! Freddy BLOWS UP into hundreds of charred pieces. As he
does so, his pure, evil essence rises out of his wrecked vessel
of a body. It looks at first like an etheral Freddy but soon
breaks into three smaller demons. We realize that these are the
living versions of the painting in Doc's office. They SWIRL
around before flying STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.

Establishing. Could be anywhere. It looks like Springwood, with
one difference. It has kids. Playing everywhere. Happy. Carefree.

going on.

INT. KITCHEN — DAY
One poor teenage KID is not outside playing. Not outside getting
his first kiss. Popping his first zit. He’s in here, getting the
crap beat out of him by his large and deranged MOTHER. She wields
a leather belt.

Get in there and take your medicine! It’ll

She shoves him into a small broom closet.
