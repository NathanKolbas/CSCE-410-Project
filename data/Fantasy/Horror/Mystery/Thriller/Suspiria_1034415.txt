INT. MARKOS COMPANY, STAFF KITCHEN -- DAWN

In a dim institutional kitchen stands a long, marble table
with twenty chairs around it.

MISS TANNER (V.O.)

Markos.

MISS MANDEL (V.O.)
Markos.

MISS KILLEN (V.O.)
Blanc!

MISS DANIELS (V.O.)
Markos!

MISS VENDEGAST (50) comes in and turns on the lights. She
gets a coal fire going in the heat stove, then another in the
cook stove. She fills a big enamel coffee pot.

MISS BOUTAHER (V.O.)

Blanc.

MISS MILLUS (V.O.)
Markos!

MISS MARTINCIN (V.O.)
Blanc.

Vendegast sets out bowls, spoons, and mugs on the table. Mue-
sli. Biscuits. Soon, other women begin drifting in. Some are
still in robes, not yet showered. They go about getting their
breakfasts and first cigarettes. Some chat casually.

Over it all, the vote continues in v.o. Each voice is strong,
decided. We may see flashes of the faces of these women dur-
ing the vote, which took place the night before. If an audi-
ence expects sinister faces, they'll be surprised: The women
of our film are banal, matronly, women you see every day.

MISS HULLER (V.O.)
Markos!

MISS HOLZMANN (V.O.)
Blanc!

MADAME BLANC (50) herself comes in for breakfast. She has the
long-limbed body and high carriage of a dancer, but her ener-
gy is not rarified. It’s grounded, open. But she looks tired.

MADAME BLANC
Good morning, everyone.
MISS MAUCERI (V.O.)
Blanc.

MISS MARKS (V.O.)
Markos!

Miss Boutaher comes over to Blanc, still in her hair net.
MISS BOUTAHER
Were you able to sleep in a lit-
tle? It was a long night.

MADAME BLANC
Yes, thank you.

MISS BOUTAHER

I’m glad.

DANIELLE (V.O.)
Markos.

MISS COTUGNO (V.O.)
Blanc.

Vendegast begins cracking eggs in a bowl, one after another.

PAVLA (V.O.)
Markos.

MISS KAPLITT (V.O.)
Blanc.

MISS VERDEGAST (V.O.)
Markos!

MISS GRIFFITH (V.O.)
Markos.

MISS VENDEGAST (V.O.)
Blanc!

MISS BALFOUR (V.O.)
Blanc.

Blanc gets coffee and takes a seat at one head of the table
and talks with Miss Holzmann. MISS TANNER (55) enters. She is
smaller in stature than Blanc, but leans hard into everything
to compensate. She and Blanc have a moment of eye contact.

ALBERTA (V.O.)
Markos!

A beat, and then, finally:
JUDITH (V.O.)
Markos.
There’s a V.O. RAPPING, some ritualized version of applause.

MISS TANNER (V.O.)

<< Markos by three. It's decided.
Let no one's vote be held against
her. And let the will of the maj-
ority proceed. Hail, Markos. >>

ALL (V.O.)
<< Hail, Markos. >>

Miss Tanner takes her coffee and sits beside Madame Blanc. As
casually as the others are chatting, Tanner says to her:

MISS TANNER
Markos is asking for you. She wants
to know if everything is ready, now
that we are clear to proceed.

MADAME BLANC
She knows my concerns about Patric-
ia. But I do agree, we should not
delay.

Tanner nods, reassured on this crucial point. She spreads her
jam on her toast. Madame Blanc gets up.

MADAME BLANC (CONT’D)
I’1l go and tell her now.

CUT TO:

EXT. BERLIN, PLATZ -- DAY

A Berlin platz is packed with protestors SHOUTING in organ-
ized rage:

CROWD
<< Free Baader! Free Ensslin! Free
Schubert! Free Raspe! We are watch-
ing! We are watching! >>
(beat)
<< Free Méller! Free Becker! We are
watching all you do! >>

Polizei observe the protest from half a block away. Some take
photos. Leaves drop down on them in the grey afternoon.
PATRICIA (20s), skirts the edges of the protest, hurrying.
She's dressed in a old fatigue jacket and leggings, weighed
down with an over-the-shoulder bag and duffle. One or two in
the crowd recognize her and gesture, but she keeps moving.

CROWD (CONT'D)
<< We remember Mutter Meinhoff! We
remember everything! >>

She gets to a statue in the platz and looks around for some-
one, as if at a planned rendezvous point. But no one’s wait-—
ing for her there, and no one comes.

She stays as long as she can. But the police notice her duf-
fle. They begin to point her out between themselves. She gets
moving again. When she sees two of the police detach from the
group to follow her, she gets around a corner and runs.

CUT TO:
INT. KLEMPERER’S BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY

Patricia hurries up a stairwell to a door on the top landing
and RINGS. There is an odd, dark light bulb in a wall socket
beside a small sign there. She is singing to herself in spite
of her fear. Nico. “The Fairest of the Seasons.”

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, ENTRYWAY -- DAY

DR. JOZEF KLEMPERER (80) answers. His face carries his many
years, creased along all the lines of longing. But it’s still
somehow an open face. He sees her fear, her duffle bag.

KLEMPERER
Patricia. What --has happened?

But Patricia dances past him, dragging in her duffle and bag,
singing as she goes. It’s odd behavior. He shuts the door and
follows her back to a worn study lined with bookcases.

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, SITTING ROOM -- DAY

Instead of sitting, Patricia dumps her bags behind a stuffed
armchair and dances around the furniture, moving to the music
in her head. She never once looks directly at Klemperer. He
sees her dismay and responds with practiced calm.

KLEMPERER
I have a patient in a few minutes,
but I can tell him to come another
time--
PATRICIA

(pleasantly)
They voted. --Can I have a seltzer?
The bartender will give you one for
free. I’m afraid.

(singing again)
I'll be leaving in the fairest of
seasons.

Klemperer lowers himself into his chair, not sure he’s heard
her correctly. She talks loudly, as if over other people in a
busy cafe. But she’s coding things, just for him.

PATRICIA (CONT’D)
This song! I have it stuck in my
head. I hear it so loud I worry oth-
ers can hear it, too.
(meaningfully)
Do you understand--?

He decides. He leans over and flips a switch low on the wall
near his chair.

INT. KLEMPERER’S BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY

A red bulb next to his door switches on, its FILAMENT BUZZ-
ING WITH VOLTAGE. The small sign beside it reads, both in Ger-
man and English, “In Session.”

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, SITTING ROOM -- DAY

Klemperer begins writing in his patient notes. We see what
must be months of work with her in his tiny handwriting.

PATRICIA
They are going to try to keep her
alive after all.

He glances up at her. He flips back through the notes. The
name “Markos” has come up before, several times. Klemperer
has called it a “besessenheit.” An obsession.

KLEMPERER
Markos?

For a second, Patricia's reaction is physical, violent.

PATRICIA
Don’t say that name--!

But then she tries to make herself laugh, as if she’s having
a very good time.
PATRICIA (CONT’D)
I’m not supposed to be here! It’s
the middle of the day! You’re a
nice boy. A nice kumpel. Isn’t that
the word? I was right. They are
witches.

Klemperer writes. Patricia moves around the room, eyes closed
and dancing.

PATRICIA (CONT’D)

I left word for Sara to meet me out
this morning. She’s the one girl
there I could give a damn about.
She’s rich, but she listens. If I
leave they may choose her next. I
don’t want them to hurt her. But
she didn't come. She didn’t get my
note, or--

(beat)
She doesn’t know what I know.
They've been underground since the
war. I found out all of it.

She realizes she’s said too many real things in a row and dis-
sembles. She’s terrified.

PATRICIA (CONT’D)
I’m having so much fun I don’t know
why you never brought me here be-
fore!

A long beat. Klemperer says, calmly:

KLEMPERER
You think they can hear you now.

She shoots him a look. Then a frightened nod. She dances to a
window and begins singing Bowie’s “Heroes,” again as if she’s
at some kind of club.

She has her eyes closed now, really trying to put herself in
another place and time.

PATRICIA
They took my hair. My urine. They
took my eyes. There’s more to that
building than what you see.

CLOSE ON: In her file, he writes: << Her delusion has deep-
ened into panic. She feels her constructed mythology is con-
firmed. >>
PATRICIA (CONT'D)
But I let them help me. I let them
give me things, too. I knew, but I
let it happen.

On Klemperer’s bookcase, there is a framed photogravure. It’s
of smiling WOMAN from the 1930s. She smiles at Patricia.

PATRICIA (CONT’D)
My mother always told me to write
my stories down. I was always tel-
ling them, but I never wrote them
down before.
(forcefully)
Kumpel!

Klemperer looks up. He sees she is crying.

PATRICIA (CONT’D)
Did you hear?! Did you understand?

KLEMPERER
Patricia--

PATRICIA
I’m going back for Sara and then
I'll come get my things.

She is weeping now, painfully desperate and afraid.

KLEMPERER
Patricia. I think you'd feel safer
if you stay at least until the pro-
test outside is gone--

PATRICIA
They convinced me it was my choice.
Rehearsal’s at noon-- I’1l be mis-
sed!

Klemperer gets to his feet. As she rushes out, she tells him:

PATRICIA (CONT’D)
If they know, they won’t hesitate.
They will hollow me out and eat my
cunt on a plate!

Then she goes out the door, giving a jolt of surprises to the
NEXT PATIENT (Male, 40s) waiting outside. Klemperer listens
to her go DOWN THE STAIRS and OUT. He goes to the window.

CLOSE ON: In the photo on his bookcase, the woman's eyes are
pale over her smile. A smile from before the war.
He looks through the sheer curtain to the street below and
watches Patricia hurry back toward the platz, then disappear.

NEXT PATIENT (0.S.)
(from the door, unsure)
Dr. Klemperer?

INT. OHIO FARMHOUSE, ADULTS’ BEDROOM -- DAY

A MENNONITE WOMAN (50s) lies in a sick bed, silently attended
to by women from the community in their modest pastel dresses
and hair coverings. She looks ravaged by disease, perhaps can-
cer. Her frail, wet BREATHING is audible. Horrible SIGHS.

Once the credits are finished, the SIGHS continue in PRE-LAP
into the next scene.

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL PFAU, SUSIE’S ROOM -- DAY

An young American, SUSIE BANNION (20s), sits in a hotel room
going over a set of handwritten directions against a street
map of Berlin. She’s confused, determined. She has no make-up
on. Her freckles stand out on her pale skin with her red hair
against her blue eyes.

Susie checks her watch. She grabs a small dance bag, counts
the money she has left: 35 Deutsche Marks and a few American
dollars she hasn’t yet exchanged all in a creased envelope
with a church logo in its return address corner. She hides it
deep between the mattresses it all and hurries to the door.

INT. HOTEL PFAU, LOBBY -- DAY

She goes to the small reception desk to ask a question, but
the two women there have their backs to her, their attention
glued to the small television there.

ON THE TV: A news report, in German, of hijacked Lufthansa
flight 181 taking off from an airport in Rome.

NOTE: This hijacking story is one of the centerpieces of the
now-imfamous “German Autumn” of 1977, which marked the end of
the Baader-Meinhof terrorist era, and which we will see un-
folding in real time on televisions throughout the film.
INT. BERLIN SUBWAY CAR -- DAY

Susie has found her way onto the Berlin subway. She looks a-
round, keeping her nerves in check as best she can. She sees
armed Polizei at various stations watching clusters of youth,
both with attitudes like battering rams.

EXT. BERLIN SUBWAY STATION, STAIRS -- DAY

Susie is on the stairs hurrying out of the subway, asking for
directions. A woman with too much lipstick half-helps her.

SUSIE
PohlstraBe--? It’s this way--?

Susie has a rural American accent: Southern Ohio, which is
almost West Virginia, but not as thick. She lacks sophistica-
tion, but makes up for it with bravery.

EXT. MARKOS COMPANY -- DAY

Susie finally arrives outside a huge old janus of a building--
two brick volumes fused down the center, one taller than the
other by several floors. It could be a factory, a school, or
an austere sort of hotel, but the stonework over the entrance
simply reads “Tanz.” Dance.

Dead leaves cartwheel around her. Susie stands a moment look-
ing up at the building, gathering herself. Then she goes in.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, ENTRANCE HALL -- DAY

Susie comes in and finds the entrance lobby empty. She looks

up at the several floors of balustrades above her. She hears

DRUMMING coming from somewhere in the building--a slow SYNCO-
PATED BEAT--and the SQUEAKS and EXERTIONS of PEOPLE DANCING.

A voice CALLS OUT DANCE CUES.

There is a KNOCKING ON GLASS and it takes SUSIE a moment to
see MISS TANNER hailing her from an interior window of the of-
fice, which looks out onto the entrance hall.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, OFFICE -- DAY

Susie comes in. Miss Tanner, made up now for the day, is all
business. Something is wrong at the company today. Susie be-
gins to feel it everywhere.

SUSIE
Miss Tanner--?
10.

MISS TANNER
Miss Bannion, I’ve been trying to
reach you at your hotel. To tell
you not to come.

SUSIE
Not come? Why--?

MISS TANNER
Something has come up at the
company just today. I was hoping
you could reschedule.

A beat. Tanner waits for Susie to offer to postpone it her-
self, but Susie just stands there, panicked. Tanner sets her
jaw.

The secretary, MISS GRIFFITH (50s), is there typing some-
thing, her back to Susie. In a small mirror on the desk, Su-
sie can see, though, that Miss Griffith is crying.

Miss Griffith’s reflection looks back and she shifts in her
chair to cut off the reflection.

MISS TANNER (CONT’D)
Very well. I have a room where you
can change and get warm. I'll call
the panel down--

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, CHANGING ROOM -- DAY

Susie has changed into a dance leotard and sits, doing some
stretches. She tries to manipulate her breathing to calm her-
self. It’s intense to watch her try to control her own body
this way. It seems to work.

She must be closer to the practice rooms now, because the
DRUMS and DANCE CUES are louder here. Susie closes her eyes.
She wants this so badly.

We see a succession of images of rehearsals going on in prac—
tice halls, but it’s unclear if Susie’s imagining them.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “WHITE” STUDIO -- DAY

Susie comes into a small audition room where Miss Tanner sits
at a table with MISS MILLIUS (50) and MISS MANDEL (30). They
all say hello, but they, too, are subdued. Susie holds a cas-
sette tape in her hand.
11.

MISS TANNER
Miss Millius and Miss Mandel are
the company’s répétiteurs.

Susie surprises them by asking, directly:

SUSIE
And Veva Blanc?

MISS TANNER
As I said, Madame Blanc is occupied
now.

Susie’s disappointment is clear.

SUSIE
But I was told--

MISS TANNER
Dear. You have no formal training
or references. Madame Blanc took
your insistance to come encourag-
ingly. That’s why you’re here at
all.

Tanner is not being cruel, just clear. A beat. Susie nods.

MISS MILLIUS
(re: the tape, kindly)
We prefer dancers to audition with-
out music.

Susie looks at Miss Mandel.

MISS MANDEL
You can keep time in your head.

Susie puts the cassette on the floor, out of the way, takes
center floor, and begins. The first movement of her audition
is so razor sharp and cutting it is startling.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

Madame Blanc is in the company’s largest studio, leading the
rehearsal Susie heard from the entrance hall. People are work-
ing in pairs and trios, all very subdued. Blanc is working
one-on-one now with SARA (20s), but stops, sensing something
going on elsewhere in the building.

Sara stops as well, waiting for Blanc.
BLANC

Sara, do you mind to continue by
yourself?
12.

Sara shakes her head. Blanc nods to the drummer DANIELLE (60)
to continue and walks to the door.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, CORRIDOR/STAIRS/“WHITE” STUDIO -- DAY

Blanc passes dancers smoking in the corridors and rooms where
group sessions are going on. She comes down the stairs to the
closed door of the “white” studio. She goes in.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “WHITE” STUDIO -- DAY

Blanc enters and discreetly sits in a folding chair by the
door so as not to interrupt. Tanner comes and whispers in her
ear, but Blanc doesn’t take her eyes off Susie. She watches
her, her expression revealing how caught off guard she is by
this, and how seriously she is taking it.

Susie, in the middle of her dance, sees, in between spins,
that Blanc is now in the room watching. Their eyes, for one
split second, meet.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, TANNER'S OFFICE -- DAY

Susie has been left to wait in Miss Tanner’s office afterward
where she sits in her street clothes again, dance bag at her
feet. She is looking around the office, barely containing her
nervousness. There are photos of the company’s history back
to the 1910s on the walls, and some personal effects of Tan-
ner’s on her desk, including a lovely dried lotus pod that’s
been painted red.

Rehearsal is breaking up and the hallway fills with dancers.
Susie catches lines from several conversations, all of them
charged.

VOICE #1
They did it while we were in mor-
ning rehearsal. Put her things in
shipping boxes.

VOICE #2
Do you think she had to go under-
ground or something? With what's go-
ing on?

VOICE #3
(irritated)
We don't know what happened!

Susie glances into the hall and briefly meets eyes with one
of the passing girls, SARA (20s), aka Voice #3.
13.

But Miss Tanner comes in with MISS VENDEGAST (60s) and closes
the door. Miss Vendegast is smiling.

MISS TANNER
I’ve just spoken with Madame Blanc.
Well done, Miss Bannion.

Susie can’t stifle the smile spreading across her face. She
can barely keep her seat, she is so excited.

MISS TANNER (CONT’D)
I imagine you’ll need to return
home to settle things and make ar-
rangements for moving to Berlin--

SUSIE
No, no. I-- I’m ready now. I can
start now.

A beat. Tanner nods.

MISS TANNER

(re: Vendegast)
Fine, then. This is Miss Vendegast.
She acts as housemother to company
members who reside here, which is
the majority. We operate as a sort
of collective.

(pointedly)
As we cannot pay our dancers much
by way of a salary, we are ina
position to offer dormitory-style
rooms rent-free, which is one way
we've found to sew up the differ-
ence.

SUSIE
You don’t charge anything --at all?

MISS TANNER
Not a mark.

Susie is so relieved, she can’t keep the tears out of her
eyes for a moment. Miss Tanner softens.

SUSIE
I’m sorry to cry!

MISS TANNER
In this company, we understand
fully the importance of a woman's
financial autonomy.
(beat)
(MORE )
14.

MISS TANNER (CONT'D)
Normally, we'd be full up at this
time of year, but we’ve had a room
open.

SUSIE
Patricia's.

She says this matter-of-factly. Miss Vendegast looks at Miss
Tanner. Tanner squints at Susie, slightly alarmed.

SUSIE (CONT'D)
Some girls were talking about her
in the hall just now.

MISS TANNER

Ah. Now that you’re one of us, I
won't be coy. Patricia has left the
company under sad circumstances. We
think she won’t be back.

(beat)
So there's room, if you’d like. We
can even move you in this afternoon
so you don’t have to pay another
night at your hotel.

MISS VENDEGAST
We'll send one of the girls to help
you with your luggage after lunch.
Is that all right.

SUSIE
Yes. Thank you. --It’s perfect.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, MEZZANINE/ENTRANCE HALL -- DAY

Three stories below, Susie walks back across the entrance
hall on her way out, trying to contain her excitement and re-
lief. Madame Blanc watches her through a large dim window.
Susie must feel watched because she glances back and then up,
all the way up to the ceiling until she’s looking right at
Madame Blanc. Neither waves. The reason becomes in clear:

SUSIE'S POV: All Susie can see is the row of mirrors at the
very top, hiding the highest mezzanine.

Madame Blanc must be standing behind one of them, but Susie
cannot know this. It is a first visual indication that the
very architecture of the building creates tension.

Susie begins to perceive, at the edge of her hearing, some-
one’s labored BREATHING. There’s no one in view. The acoust-
ics of three-story hall may explain it. Unnerved, she goes.

CUT TO:
15.

INT. HOTEL PFAU, SUSIE’S ROOM -- NIGHT

A storm is coming down hard and with THUNDER. Susie is in her
hotel window looking down to the street. A taxi pulls up.
Sara, the dancer from the corridor, gets out.

EXT. HOTEL PFAU -- NIGHT

Sara looks up at the hotel and sees Susie. She waves. Susie
waves back, already running to get out of the downpour.

INT. HOTEL PFAU, SUSIE’S ROOM -- NIGHT

Sara comes in soaked. She’s clearly from money. She doesn’t
overtly advertise this. Her clothes are lovely, but it’s more
in the way she carries herself.

SARA
I'm sorry I’m late. It’s the rain.
Whenever it rains, everyone in Ber-
lin jumps in a cab. And like an mo-
ron, I just let ours go. It’1l take
an hour to get another one now. Oh
I’m Sara. We’ll have to take our
chances in the street. You have an
umbrella?

Susie shakes her head.

SARA (CONT’D)
(looking around)
That’s okay. We can borrow one from
the hotel if they have them.

But Susie’s luggage is still open on the floor, things every-
where.

SUSIE
When you weren't here by six I had
to take the room for another night.

SARA
I’m so sorry! Everything was a mess
at the Company today.
(off Susie’s look)
Why are you smiling?

SUSIE
Berlin. You said “everybody in Ber-
lin” a second ago and I thought:
That includes me now. I live here
now.

Sara smiles at Susie’s guilelessness.
16.

SARA
Yes. Congrats. I heard you here a
sensation today.

Susie shrugs, happy. There’s a roll of THUNDER.

SARA (CONT’D)

I should maybe go before this gets
worse, then. I’1l come back in the
morning?

SUSIE
If it will be so bad getting a cab,
sleep here if you want. We can push
the beds apart. I have an extra
nightgown--

Sara considers the invitation, surprised and moved by Susie’s
openness.

SARA
We’ll miss dinner, but we can order
room service. To celebrate!
(intuiting)
On me! As a “welcome to Berlin.”

CUT TO:

They finish plates of meatballs and Jagerschnitzel. They also
ordered big German beers, which they’ve drunk. The storm out-—
side has gotten worse. The power goes out for a moment, then
comes back on.

SARA (CONT’D)
Have you called your family yet, to
tell them?

Sara is a little drunk. The nightgowns are almost comically
conservative. Sara looks at the stitching and sees: it’s hand
sewn.

SARA (CONT’D)
Did you tell me where you’re from?

SUSIE
Tell me about Madame Blanc! She
came into my audition, but she left
right after.

The lights go out and this time they don’t come back on.
Lightning occasionally brightens the windows, giving them dim
light.
17.

SARA

She's incredible. The way she trans-
mits her work, her energy. When it
shines on you, it’s --addictive, is
the word for it. And she’s tough--
She kept the company alive through
the war--think about that--when the
Reich just wanted women to shut off
their minds and keep their uteruses
open, there was Blanc.

(beat)
--La vraie chose!

SUSIE
Is that French? I don’t even know!

There is a SUDDEN DETONATION outside nearby, markedly differ-
ent from thunder. It shakes the glass. They run and open the
window to look. It came from down the street. They can’t see
from this angle, so Sara leans out, into the rain.

SARA
I can smell it. A bomb.

SUSIE
A bomb?!

Susie keeps her from falling out. Police SIRENS are coming.

SARA
There’s a bank that way.

She comes back into the room, looking at Susie.

SARA (CONT’D)
Don’t you know what’s happening
here? The hijackers are negotiating
a release for the Stammheim prison-
ers tonight. There are riots.

Susie doesn’t answer.

SARA (CONT’D)
The RAF? Baader-Meinhof?

SUSIE
I don’t know what that is.

SARA
They kidnapped an executive. During
the war he was Nazi SS. An officer.
Now he runs the German Employer's
Association--
(beat)
(MORE )
18.

SARA (CONT'D)
You don’t get how awful that is, do
you?

Susie shakes her head: This means nothing to her. Sara shi-
vers and closes the window.

SARA (CONT’D)
I didn’t either. Until I came here.
--And my Father’s in the Diplomatic
Service.

Susie goes to the bathroom and comes back with a thick towel.
She sees Sara is now sitting on the bed in tears.

SUSIE
What is it?!

Susie sits on the bed next to her.

SARA
I’m sorry. All of this-- I’m just
worried about a friend. It’s been
an terrible day.

SUSIE
I heard you talking about her in
the hall. I knew something was
wrong.

SARA
She just left this morning, telling
Ms. Tanner she had a “family emer-
gency.” No one knows what to do.

SUSIE
What do you mean?

SARA

She was active, in some political
groups. So we don’t know where she
is, really. If she’s in hiding, if
she’s all right.

(beat)
I just want to know she’s if all
right.

SUSIE
Is she a very good dancer?

Sara looks at Susie, at her earnestness and innocence. It
shouldn’t, but it comforts her.
19.

SARA
Yes. Very good. But an even better
friend.

SUSIE
Then I bet you’ll hear from her tom-
morrow. --Right?

Sara finally nods, then smiles, grateful for the comfort.
CUT TO:
INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- PRE-DAWN

Dr. Klemperer is already awake when his ALARM CLOCK RINGS. He
reaches out to shut it off. While he finds the switch it
RINGS so long someone KNOCKS on the wall.

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- PRE-DAWN

The sky in the tiny window over his toilet is just bluing up
with the coming of dawn. Klemperer shaves slowly and careful-
ly in his cracked mirror. One of the two bathroom doors has
been sealed up and shelved now, a wall between apartments.

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, SITTING ROOM -—- DAWN

Klemperer is tying his shoes. It takes a few moments. The

RADIO beside him is playing Erik Satie’s “Vexations.” When he
gets his shoes tied, he shuts it off, taps out his pipe, and
gets his coat. He makes sure the heat stove screen is closed.

EXT. WEST BERLIN, FRIEDRICHSTRABE -- DAY

An early morning sun is drying the pavements from last
night’s storm. It’s shaken leaves out of the trees and plast-—
ered them onto the curbs and sidewalks.

Klemperer makes his way slowly up a main avenue in his neigh-
borhood. It is a squatter’s part of town, full of art pione-
ers and youth in revolt. The ones who recognize him nod to
him like a grandpa. He buys a morning newspaper beside a sub-—
way station. Headlines announce the Palestinian hijackers of
Flight 181 have flown the captured Lufthansa to Bahrain.

INT. S-BAHN TRAIN -- DAY

Klemperer rides the train into East Germany. Next to him is a
middle-aged PRIEST. His lip is cut and swollen. The other is
a WOMAN (20) with bitten nails and a hospital band around her
wrist. In her lap is a sleeping BOY (3).

When the train stops at FriedrichstraBe Station, everyone is
made to get out.
20.

INT. FRIEDRICHSTRABE STATION, CHECKPOINT -- DAY
Klemperer is in line to show his papers at the police check.

He is waved through and heads up the stairs into the Russian
Sector. One of the armed guards also gives Klemperer a nod,
as to a familiar face.

EXT. EAST BERLIN, FRIEDRICHSTRABE -- DAY

Klemperer continues down the avenue two blocks. East Berlin
is visibly still on its knees from the war, even years later.
The rubble and the decay, has the feeling of having been tid-
ied, but not yet confronted.

He turns off and walks toward a small cobbled corner of an
otherwise nondescript intersection. There is a small fountain
in the stonework, but nothing comes out of it. There is a ma-
sonry bench there just wide enough room for two people to sit
at the lip of its dry bowl. Klemperer takes a seat there.

We are witnessing a habit, a ritual, possibly a daily occur-
rence. He says out loud, to no one, like a mantra:

KLEMPERER
<< And maybe today, my love. >>

Then he opens his paper and begins eating his breakfast out
of a waxed paper bag he’s brought with him.

CUT TO:
INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, ENTRYWAY/SITTING ROOM -- DAY

Klemperer returns to his apartment to find: No one is wait-
ing. He lets himself in.

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, ENTRYWAY/KITCHEN -- DAY

At some point, Klemperer’s housekeeper, FRAU SESAME (50s)
lets herself in the front door. She sees the door to Klemper-
er’s sitting room is open and he is sitting inside alone. She
immediately begins chatting while she takes out her cleaning
bucket from under the sink.

FRAU SESAME
<< They're out again today, Doctor.
For the prisoners. Do you think it
will end today? >>

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, SITTING ROOM -- DAY

Klemperer is not listening. He is looking at the bags Patri-
cia left behind. They’ve been moved to the corner.
21.

He goes to them. He unzips the duffle and begins looking
through it. Clothes. Boots. Then a notebook. He hesitates,
and then opens it. It is near full with entries, drawings,
hand-drawn maps. He begins reading.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, STAIRCASE -- DAY

Susie and Sara carry Susie’s luggage up to the third floor
passing the mirrors Susie saw the day before. She’s now re-
flected in them from just below.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENCE CORRIDORS -- DAY

They come into a corridor of dormitory-type rooms. Some of
the girls are stealing a few moments in their rooms between
breakfast and rehearsal. When Susie appears on the floor, a
few come out and introduce themselves.

Susie smiles at them, greets them. One older dancer, OLGA
(40), who is on a telephone, hears what’s going on and steps
out to look, but as soon as she sees Susie, she dismisses her
and goes back to the argument she was having on the phone.

OLGA (0.S.)
Why don’t you try speaking to me
like you love me for a change--

Sara rolls her eyes and brings Susie to the end of one cor-
ridor, pointing out as they pass a room at the end:

SARA
That’s my room--

The hall turns right, then right again revealing a parallel
corridor, also with dorm rooms. Susie’s is first. They go in.

SARA (CONT’D)
We're sort of neighbors.

SUSIE
I’m glad.

SARA

Settle in. I’1l tell Ms. Vendegast
we made it. Rehearsal isn’t for
forty minutes. Listen for the bell.

(off Susie’s nod)
Knock on the wall if you need
anything, okay? I’m right on the
other side.
22.

SUSIE
Sara-—

Sara turns back.

SUSIE (CONT'D)
(re: the room)
Is this--?

SARA
No. Olga took Patricia's room. It’s
the biggest. She said she needed
the space.
(sotto)
She’s Russian.

With that, Sara goes. Susie looks around the room, excited.
It’s simple: A bed, a dresser, a desk, an old-fashioned stand
with a basin and mirror. But no windows. It’s an interior
room inside the center of the building.

She has an odd moment of settling into the space, of hearing
her own breathing. She pulls a suitcase up onto the bed and
flips open the latches to start unpacking.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, OFFICE -- DAY
A hand pulls a thick cord and then:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENCE CORRIDOR -- DAY
The BELL for rehearsal rings in the residents’ corridor.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

All the dancers are there, stretching. Madame Blanc and Miss
Tanner come in.

BLANC
Good morning. Good morning.

Tanner goes to join Danielle at the drums for a moment. Blanc
goes right in among the dancers.

BLANC (CONT'D)

We have some happier company bus-
iness today. I’d like to introduce
our new dancer, Susie Bannion. She
has come to us from America and I
know you’1ll all make her very wel-
come.

(beat)
(MORE )
23.

BLANC (CONT'D)
I saw her audition myself. I can as-
sure you, we’re lucky to have her.

Everyone smiles and nods to Susie, some come over to hug her
or squeeze her shoulder. Olga watches this, irritated by it.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Would you like to say anything, Su-
sie?

Susie looks around the group, unprepared.

SUSIE
Oh-- Um. I don’t know! Hello--?
(laughing)
I’m sorry. I don’t know what to

say!
Everyone laughs warmly.

BLANC
I'll talk for now, then: Welcome to
our little family. Join in as you
feel ready, but there’s no rush.

Susie smiles, blushing now. She nods in thanks.

BLANC (CONT'D)
All right. For rehearsal today, we
should get right back to where we
were last week, with Volk.

(beat)

I’ve talked to Olga and she will
now be dancing the protagonist.
Sara, I'd like you to take Olga’s
part. Is everyone happy with that?

Susie watches Sara receive the news. Sara closes her eyes for
a moment, the extent of her outward celebration in front of
Blanc. Susie smiles for her.

CUT TO:

The dancers are in the middle of a sequence in which Olga is
spinning between clusters of two and three dancers. Susie
sits on the edge, watching for now.

Olga’s not judging the spaces correctly and is a step or two
off in each collision. She’s getting increasingly frustrated.

BLANC (CONT'D)
The groups are moving, too, Olga.
Just aim yourself ahead of where
you think you'll cross with them--
24.

OLGA
I am.

She tries this, and it works. But then she stops abruptly.

OLGA (CONT'D)
This is shit. Such shit.

Danielle stops PLAYING the DRUM. Tanner sighs.

BLANC
It’s all right. I’m pushing.
(to everyone)
Why don’t we break for ten?

But Olga’s frustration is not about the rehearsal. She’s in-
dignant. She says, directly to Blanc and Tanner.

OLGA
You can’t even be bothered to re-
spect your own lies.

MISS TANNER
Miss Chkalov.

BLANC

(to Tanner)
Oh, let her squeeze if she wants
to. It’s only pus.

(to Olga)
Patricia’s gone, Olga. We don’t
know why. She said a family issue,
but we all know there’s a good
chance that isn’t true. If she’s
gone into hiding, she wouldn’t tell
us.

OLGA
She would have told someone. That’s
not what happened.

Blanc steps fully into this, taking slow steps toward Olga.

BLANC
Ponto. Now Schleyer. Prosecutors
beaten in Viktoriapark. Firms burn-
ed. A bomb in Kreuzberg last night.

OLGA
She wouldn’t do any of that!

BLANC
We know she met with groups that
believed in targets, Olga.
(MORE)
25.

BLANC (CONT'D)
And these kinds of actions require
a lot of people.

OLGA
But she left them. You know she did
and you know why.

BLANC

(ignoring this)
She wanted to do something with her
beliefs. We can all admire that.
And there are changes to be made,
no question. But if she’s in some
cellar filling Beamiester bottles
with petrol, that’s her choice. Who
won't be sad if she’s shot by the
polizei, but what can we do? We all
tried to talk to her. To give her
alternatives.

Susie watches all of this, fascinated.

OLGA
You manipulate everything--
Everyone-- She didn’t trust you--!
Because you’re hypocrites.

BLANC
She doesn’t trust anyone, Olga. I
never took it personally. Neither
should you.

This has reduced Olga to furious tears.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Take Olga up to her room. We’re all
worried about Patricia, but concern
is no excuse for hysteria.

OLGA
No, Miss Tanner, call Olga a cab.
She's had enough and is going to
pack her things and get the fuck
out of this box of rabies.

Olga starts hurrying toward the door.

BLANC
Olga.

Olga points directly back at Blanc and shouts:

OLGA
Koldun' ya!
26.
Olga storms out. Blanc lets the intensity in her own face dis-
sipate to show the company the hurt underneath.
BLANC
I’m sorry for that. It’s a hot
thing we do.
They hear a door SLAM in the near distance.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, HALLWAY/STAIRWAY/HALLWAY -- DAY

Olga shakes with anger as the adrenaline peaks in her system.
She takes the stairs two at a time up to the dorm.

At the top of the stairs, ALBERTA (50s) a stocky woman who is
the company’s maintenance person is sitting in an alcove.

OLGA
I'm leaving, Alberta. I can’t swal-
low any more of this.
She heads to her room and starts packing a small bag.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY
Miss Tanner has stepped forward to Blanc’s side.
MISS TANNER
Who is also unhappy? Let’s get it
all out, all at once--
Blanc motions to her “that’s enough.”
BLANC
I’ll talk to Olga later. We’ve got
an hour and a half. Can we go on?
Is everyone all right if we go on?
She waits until enough people nod.
BLANC (CONT'D)
Who dances the protagonist then? Ca-
roline? Sonia?

SONIA (20s) and CAROLINE (20s) look at one another.

SONIA
I can’t. Not yet.

BLANC
Caroline, then.

Caroline just stands there. She looks at the door where the
sounds of her friend leaving have gone silent.
27.

BLANC (CONT'D)
That’s all right. We’1ll manage.

A voice from the side of the room surprises everyone.

SUSIE (0.S.)
I’1l dance.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, CORRIDORS/“MIRRORED” STUDIO -- DAY

Olga, bag in hand, comes back down the stairs. Alberta is no
longer there. Olga hesitates, as if confused.

OLGA’S POV: Outside the window, she can see a slice of the
street in front of the company. People pass by in their suits
and autumn coats. That's where she wants to go, but she stag-
gers the slightest bit and then heads in the wrong direction,
further into the school.

There is no one on this floor that she can see. She proceeds
as if in fog, her hands up as if she is having trouble seeing
or concentrating. She turns down a second corridor, further
away from the front of the building.

Finally, she turns into a studio fully lined with framed mir-
rors floor to ceiling, and on the ceiling as well.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

Blanc turns to find who’s said this. It was Susie.

SUSIE
I know it.

BLANC
Susie.

SUSIE

It was in the documentary. I’ve
watched it a hundred times at the
library. I know this dance.

BLANC
Darling. We rehearsed it for ten
months before performing it.

SUSIE
I've seen it performed in person,
too. In New York.

Everyone is cringing for Susie at this point. But she doesn’t
back down.
28.

BLANC
Well. If you want to try, go ahead,

Blanc moves to her. When she gets to her she says, ina
concerned tone, more discreetly.

BLANC (CONT'D)
You've already impressed us.

SUSIE
I know this.

BLANC
You're very sure?

Susie nods. Behind them, Tanner looks increasingly agitated.

MISS TANNER
First do it alone then. We don’t
want to put the others at risk. The
last thing we need is someone to
get kicked in the ribs.

Susie nods and goes out onto the floor. She readies herself,
waits for the drum beat, and then begins. It’s bold, precise,
but also wild. Blanc looks at Tanner, then calls out:

BLANC
Stop.

Susie does, half-sure she is about to be dismissed. Blanc
goes to Susie and gets on her knees. She takes Susie’s left
foot and presses her thumb up into the arch.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Clear your head. I want you to
start over. Are you stretched? This
is no joke.

Susie nods. Blanc takes her right foot and does the same
gesture. Then she does it to each of Susie’s hands. It is a
hybrid of a massage and something --ambiguous. When she’s
done, Susie looks at her hand.

SUSIE'S POV: The imprints of Blanc's thumbs are still white
marks on the back of Susie's hand. Like a “T".

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “MIRRORED” STUDIO -- DAY
Olga is looking through the haze of her mesmerization for a

way out of the room. The door she came in must have shut, but
she can see no opening in any wall. No handle.
29.

All she can see is her tiny figure caught in reflections ec-
hoing back and forth to infinity.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

Now Blanc steps back, way back. She takes a different posi-
tion this time, and as she does, Tanner moves into a new posi-
tion. The two women make a triangle now, with Susie as its
vertex.

BLANC
Remember, start on one with the mus-—
ic. If you feel ill, stop at once.

It’s an odd thing to say, but Susie has to get her mind in-
side what’s about to happen. She nods at Blanc. She’s ready.

BLANC (CONT'D)
And--

Susie and the music begin.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “MIRRORED” STUDIO -- DAY

Olga is lost in the reflections. She can only slowly look
from one to the other, studying them for a chink, something
that can indicate a way out.

As she turns again, her head snaps back with the force of an
invisible blow. For a moment, she sees the center of a blue
iris. The blow is so powerful it dislocates one side of her
jaw out of its hinge. She makes a terrified sound.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

Susie pulls her leg back from a kick, but does not lunge, it
was a hard kick. She then moves into a series of turns that
set up the next kick. When she kicks out--

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “MIRRORED” STUDIO -- DAY

Olga’s throat is punched in, as is the scream it shocks out
of her. The SOUND she makes instead is horrible to hear. She
goes to her knees, one hand on her crushed windpipe.

A pair of successive blows breaks ribs and cracks her stern-
um. All of the damage is happening under her skin. There is
no blood, just agony. She is trying to cry out, but can only
make a horrible MEWLING sound. The next kick dislocates a
shoulder.
30.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

Susie is giving the dance everything she has. It is violent
and beautiful to watch. Blanc shoots out a hand and snaps to
Danielle, hissing:

BLANC
Keep up--

Miss Tanner is watching, arms folded, like a proud Papa.

MISS TANNER
(in a whisper)
Brava brava brava--

The force of Susie’s movements is being intensified exponenti-
ally somehow and transferred to Olga. INTERCUT between the
two studios:

We watch Susie move through the rest of the solo. Olga moves
from being beaten to being pulverized. As muscles are separa-
ted from bone, and bones are broken, her silhouette becomes
increasingly uncanny.

We see Olga’s, Susie’s, and Blanc’s eyes in close up. Olga is
in trauma, Susie is in ecstacy, and Blanc has a melancholy in
her expression. She takes no joy, apparently, in this via do-
lorosa.

Olga’s form ceases to look human, though it is not yet finish-
ed being alive.

Finally, Susie finishes the dance and has to sit immediately
on the floor to keep from vomiting. For a moment no one helps
her, so astonished are they. Then Blanc get down on her knees
at Susie’s side.

INTERCUTS END.

BLANC
It’‘ll pass. You’re not the first
dancer to lose the room.

SUSIE
I’m not usually dizzy.

BLANC
It’s my fault. I couldn’t help my-
self. Sara-- take her upstairs now.
She can spend the day there.
(getting up, to Susie)
A collapse is a vocational hazard
I'm afraid.
31.

SUSIE
I didn’t collapse.

BLANC
You’re on the floor. And that’s not
how the dance ends, cher.

Susie gets up on her own. She’s defensive for some reason.

SUSIE
I was trying not to throw up in
your studio.

BLANC
Susie, it’s all right! It was won-
derful. I'll send Miss Vendegast
with your lunch early. You’re pro-
bably jet-lagged as well.

Sara and Susie head for the door. When they are out of ear-
shot, Sara whispers:

SARA
That was fucking incredible--

The other girls all watch them leave. Madame Blanc says to
Miss Tanner, lightly:

BLANC
What a surprise. Olga always made
that piece look like such heavy
lifting.

The comment has its intended effect. The girls look inspired.

CUT TO:

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SUSIE’S ROOM -- DUSK

Susie is in her room, unpacking. She looks a little hollowed
out from the events of the afternoon.

She can hear the other girls going about their evening rou-
tines. Someone is hanging a poster. There is HAMMERING. She
can hear her own name now and then as well, but not what’s
being said about her. She steps to the closed door to listen,
but there is a KNOCK and Miss Vendegast comes in with a tray
of lidded plastic cups.

All have been labelled with initials. Most are full of urine.

MISS VENDEGAST
How are you feeling, Susie?
32.

Miss Vendegast hands her a cup with her initials on it.

MISS VENDEGAST (CONT’D)
We do this several times a year.
Unannounced. I need you to fill it.

SUSIE
I just went a little while ago--

MISS VENDEGAST
Half is fine.

Susie takes the cup and goes into the little WC in the hall.
She closes the door and gets ready to try to fill it. Miss
Vendegast hums to cover the noise.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENTS’ WC -- DUSK
Susie holds the cup and tries to pee. The WC is tiny.

MISS VENDEGAST (0.S.)
I've also brought the residency
forms we'll need you to read and
sign. I leave them in your room--

Then memory comes to Susie, forcefully:
CUT TO:
EXT. OHIO FARMHOUSE -- DAY

Work is being done on the house, shingles are HAMMERED into
place. A gaggle of Mennonite girls can be seen playing “Crack
the Whip” outside, laughing in their pastel dresses.

There are CARNAL MURMURINGS coming from inside the house, out
one of the window screens. The girls hear it and come over to
peer inside.

GIRL’S POV: Young Susie's feet are extending out of the clo-
set. She is lying inside, masturbating.

One of the girls runs to fetch someone. In a moment, Susie’s
mother comes in and finds her.

SUSIE'S MOTHER is younger here, healthy, not the ravaged wo-
man from the opening credits. Susie (13) is lying on her back
with her Mennonite dress pulled up, bonnet off.

Susie’s mother reaches in and yanks Susie up by her hair.
Susie steadies herself on the door jamb. Susie’s sisters look
on in horror from the window. Some of the men have come down
off the roof as well to see what’s going on.
33.

SUSIE
It’s all a rhythm, Momma. You draw
it with your fingers--

Susie’s mother sees her fingers in the crack in the thin,
slatted closet door and pistons it shut. Susie pulls her hand
free and holds it to her mouth, but even then her eyes smile
into her mother’s blast of shame.

BACK TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENTS’ WC -- DUSK

In the little WC, Susie thinks of this while her urine begins
to FLOW into the cup.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SUSIE’S ROOM -- DUSK
CLOSE ON: Susie places her urine sample with the others.

MISS VENDEGAST (0.S.)
If you feel up to it, Madame Blanc
invites you to join her for dinner
in an hour. Shall I tell her you’1l
come?

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “MIRRORED” STUDIO -- DUSK

The lights are still on in the mirrored studio. Olga’s re-
mains lie on the floor. One eye peers up out of the uncanny
mess. A single drop of blood stains it.

Blanc and several other MATRONS watch as MISS HOLZMANN (40s)
and MISS COTUGNO (50s) place silver hooks under Olga’s arms
to drag her out of the room.

It’s clear from Blanc’s expression that the damage caused to
Olga is worse than what she’d expected. Tanner comes to her
side.

MISS TANNER
She couldn’t have known what she
was doing--

BLANC
No. She just carried more current
than we expected. She’s a natural,
that one.
Madame Blanc is trying to contain her own excitement now.

CUT TO:
34.

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, SITTING ROOM -- DUSK

Dr. Klemperer sits in his office, staring in the middle dis-
tance. The last light in the sky is fading. The framed photo
of his wife smiles at him. He’s got Patricia’s pale notebook
open on his desk.

We see names we know--M. BLANC, SARA, OLGA, HELENA MARKOS--
and names we do not. It is also jammed with little exhibits
from Patricia's life--ticket stubs from concerts, newspaper
clippings about terrorist actions around Berlin, more than a
few programs from dance performances.

One section has drawings of some iconographic symbols, as if
from some vulgar religion. It is this symbology that unset-
tles Klemperer most.

He closes the notebook and picks up the phone. He dials.
VOICE ON PHONE
<< Police. What is the nature of
your call? >>
Klemperer looks on the verge of hanging up, but he does not.
KLEMPERER
<< I’m reporting a young woman who
may be missing. >>

VOICE ON PHONE
<< Hold the line. >>

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, STAIRS AND CORRIDORS -- NIGHT
Miss Vendegast guides Susie down two flights of stairs and
into the staff section of the building. They talk along the
way, but the acoustics of the building muffle it. Miss Ven-
degast knocks on Blanc’s door.
After a moment, Blanc answers, wearing now a Japanese silk
tunic. She is smiling when she opens the door, but when she
sees Susie, it fades.
BLANC

You don’t look better. Or are you

this pale all the time--?
Blanc nods at Miss Vendegast, who goes, and lets Susie in.

CUT TO:
35.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, BLANC’S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Madame Blanc’s office is a Beaux-Arts beauty. Its curved
walls are painted with a long Japanese garden. A small table
is laid with dinner, which Susie and Blanc are finishing.

An arch leads into a dark, smaller circular room that must be
Blanc’s private studio. Light from the office glints off some
kind of lacquered screens there.

BLANC
It’s different from being Amish,
then?

SUSIE

Yes. The Amish split from the Menno-
nites in the 17th century.

BLANC
Why?

SUSIE
They worried the Mennonites were be-
coming too liberal. But they still
believe many of the same things.

BLANC
Such as?

SUSIE
Adult baptism. Plain clothing. Non-
resistance.

BLANC
“They”? Not “we”? Have you left re-
ligious thinking behind you?

Susie offers a small nod.

BLANC (CONT'D)

Oligarchs writing for patriarchs.
(beat)

You don’t like to talk about this.

SUSIE
I don’t know why we are.

BLANC
I find it hard not to be curious
about you. In two days you’ve man-
aged to audition, be accepted, and
dance a lead.

Blanc smiles.
36.

BLANC (CONT'D)
I’m not trying to make you self-con-
scious.

SUSIE
I came here to dance.

BLANC
But how’ve you even heard of us?

SUSIE
I went to New York. To the Martha
Graham Center. I saw you there
three times.

BLANC
Your parents took you?

SUSIE
I went by bus once and hitchhiked
the other times.

BLANC
Wasn’t that dangerous?

Susie shrugs.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Were you punished for it?

SUSIE
Of course.

A beat. Blanc is moved. She takes Susie’s hand for a moment.

BLANC
That's extraordinary.
(beat)
You were right to insist on an
audition.

SUSIE
I’m lucky you’re doing VOLK. Some
of the choreographies makes sense
to me, some doesn’t. I remember the
ones that make sense. WHITE STAR
does. This does. All the solos from
XENOS-—

An odd beat.

BLANC
All mine.
(beat)
(MORE )
37.

BLANC (CONT'D)
How did it feel to dance Volk today
in front of the one who made it?

SUSIE
I don’t know how to put it--

BLANC
Actually, don’t. That’s a vain
question. Let me ask a different
one: While you danced it, what was
happening inside you-- in your
body?

Susie thinks.

SUSIE
It felt like what I think it must
feel like to fuck.

BLANC
(curious, but unfazed)
Do you mean fuck a man?

SUSIE
No. I was thinking of an animal.

BLANC
You looked joyful. In pain, but in
joy as well.

Susie nods. A long beat. Blanc smiles, sincerely.

BLANC (CONT'D)
We don’t teach dance here, Susie.

We assume dancers come trained. You
are not. I don’t exactly understand
what you are yet, but I will ask Ca-
roline to help you with your jumps
and leaps. Yours are nowhere near
good enough yet. We must build you
up now.

SUSIE
So I can dance the VOLK protagon-
ist when you perform it?

A beat. Blanc leans back in her chair.

BLANC
I’ll have to see you do that level
of dancing again and again. The sim-
plicity of the choreography is an
illusion. It’s intuitive to watch
and painful to do.

(MORE )
38.

BLANC (CONT'D)
We perform next month. I’1l have to
grind you to get there in time.

SUSIE
I can do it.

BLANC

I don’t have many options,
actually. And I’d rather have some-
one on who’s messy, but alive than
another Olga. She was a matryoshka
doll with legs. I’m relieved she’s
gone.

(beat)
Thank you for your help in that.

Blanc watches Susie’s reaction closely, but there doesn’t
seem to be any complicity in it. Just grateful excitement.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SUSIE’S ROOM -- NIGHT

When Susie gets back to her room, Sara pokes her head in.
Susie motions her to come in and close the door behind her.
She grabs Sara’s hands.

SUSIE
I didn’t know it was going to be
like this! She’s so nice.
(beat)
And she wants me to dance in VOLK.
The protagonist!

Sara nods, but with less energy than Susie was expecting.

SUSIE (CONT'D)
Are you okay?

SARA
Yes. I’m fine. I was just thinking
about Olga. --About what she said
today.

Susie remembers.

SUSIE
I’m sorry. I’m on my own little
shooting star today. When everyone
is so upset--

Sara looks at Susie.

SARA
If I asked you for a favor tomor-
row, would you do it?

SARA (CONT'D)
(beat)
We might get caught.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, STAFF KITCHEN -- NIGHT

In the staff kitchen, Tanner and a few of the other matrons
are finishing their own dinners.

MISS TANNER
<< Things can be honed. Blanc is go-
ing to work out another approach.
How could we have known what would
happen? What we are attempting has-—
n’t been done in living memory. >>

MISS KAPLITT
<< How do we know it will work at
all? If it killed one girl, it may
kill any we try. >>

MISS TANNER
<< Patricia was unwilling. Blanc
believes that is the key. >>

MISS KAPLITT
<< It was more than that. >>

MISS TANNER
<< No. We should not have forced
it. What a fool. What we offered
her! She wanted to blow up depart-
ment stores instead. >>

Miss Huller, smoking a cigarette over her pork chop, says:

MISS HULLER
<< How do we know no one’s planning
to blow us up, too. Patricia might
have said anything to anyone about
us. Anyone might have followed her
here. >>

MISS TANNER
<< If she did, we’ll know. We can-
not despair. We have time yet. >>

From the other end of the table, MISS MARKS (50s) speaks up.

MISS MARKS
<< How much time? The vote was a
mistake.

(MORE )
40.

MISS MARKS (CONT'D)
If Markos dies before we can figure
this out, we are finished. >>

Several of the women are made frightened by this conversa-
tion.

MISS TANNER
<< Markos has strength left in her.
She will wait until we find another
girl. >>

MISS MARKS
<< You’ve seen her! She has disease
stacked atop disease. How long can
she possibly hold on? >>

Without warning, Miss Griffith, the secretary from the front
office, takes a knife from the table and cuts her own throat.

The women on either side of her cannot stop her in time. A
shocked beat. Then everyone moves at once to lay her down and
put pressure on the bleeding. Someone elevates her legs. Miss
Griffith looks up at them all as the life drains out of her,
already shivering.

MISS MILLIUS
<< Stay with us! Please, stay! >>

Tanner shouts to the women closest to the door.

MISS TANNER
<< Find Blanc now! >>

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SUSIE’S ROOM -- NIGHT

Susie is sleeping, deep in a dream. Her breathing is not the
only BREATHING in the room.

INT. CATACOMBS -- NIGHT (DREAM)

Susie walks through catacombs in her dream. A font of pure
white FLAME lights up the bony corridors as she goes. Her
feet are bare. Bodies, bent to every attitude--or collected
and stored by part--line every inch of wall and ceiling, all
leathery, all still.

She goes from chamber to chamber. If something catches her
eye, she approaches, no matter if it is low or high up it is.
Physics don’t matter here. She peers into the face of a dres-—
sed bride hung from the ceiling. She peers into the faces of
a row of young boys seated on the floor along the wall, all
dressed in woolen suits and caps.
41.

All the while, the FONT leads her to the sound of HER OWN
BREATHING.

CUT TO:
EXT. MARKOS COMPANY -- DAWN

The street is empty in the early, frosty morning. At the
front door of the company stand DETECTIVES HALLE (40) and DE-
TECTIVE MOSER (60). They’ve knocked. They stomp their feet to
stay warm and Moser knocks again. In a moment, the door is
opened by Miss Vendegast.

DETECTIVE HALLE
<< Good morning, Ma’‘am. We'd like
to talk to someone in charge, Mrs.
Markos if she’s here, about a girl
named--
(looking at his notepad)
Hingle. Patricia Hingle. >>

Miss Vendegast says nothing, but he responds as if she has.

DETECTIVE HALLE (CONT’D)
<< Someone named “Blanc,” then. >>

MISS VENDEGAST
<< Yes. I am she. Why don’t you fol-
low me inside? >>

She stands aside to let them in and they disappear inside the
building marked “Tanz.”

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, STAIRCASE/CORRIDORS -- DAY

Sara leads Susie down to the first level, past rooms where
members of the Corps are rehearsing with the répétiteurs, and
then further into the building. They come down a corridor and
hear some LAUGHTER coming from a further office, but the rest
of the floor is quiet. They find a door marked:

“Miss Martincin, Accountant”
“Miss Holzmann, Touring Director”

It is unlocked. They slip in and close the door silently be-
hind them.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, ACCOUNTANT’S OFFICE -- DAY
In a back room of the office, Sara and Susie move to an

alcove where there are half a dozen filing cabinets. They are
all locked.
42.

Sara looks through the nearest desk and finds a nail file in
Miss Martincin’s drawer. She proceeds to slide it into a gap
above the drawer, find the latch, and nudge it open.

Susie keeps looking toward the door.

The first cabinet is not what they’re looking for. But the
second is personnel files, including a file for each dancer.
Sara quickly scans through them.

SARA
Patricia’s isn’t here anymore.

SUSIE
Try Olga’s.

Sara looks.

SARA
Everyone’s here but them.

Susie looks at through everything on Miss Martincin’s desk,
in her inbox, but there’s nothing.

Sara checks the Rolodex, flipping through the typed cards. A
bad reproduction of John Atkinson Grimshaw’s “The Lady of
Shalott II” hangs over the desk, ignoring them.

SARA (CONT’D)

I just need a number. For a parent--
or anyone who can tell us for sure
she’s not in Berlin.

Susie holds up a hand, hearing something. The BREAKFAST BELL.

SUSIE
Maybe Olga will come back on her
own, when she cools off.

SARA
Then why remove her file? As if she
was never here.

SUSIE
Blanc may not want her back even if
she does come.

A dead end. Sara shrugs, not happy. She tosses the nail file
back in the drawer and something catches her eye. She pulls
the desk drawer out even further and finds, in the back:

At least a dozen tubes of lipstick, worn to varying degrees.
And at least as many little eye shadows.
43.

INT. CORRIDORS, MARKOS COMPANY -- DAY

They come silently back out into the corridor. As they turn
to head back, another BURST OF LAUGHTER comes from a back of-
fice. There is something mocking in it.

Susie takes a step away from Sara to look discreetly around
the next corner. Through a door that’s half open, Susie can
see through one office into the next.

SUSIE'S POV: Detectives Halle and Moser stand expressionless
and naked before Miss Tanner, Miss Huller, and Miss Vende-
gast, their cocks hanging out. Moser's body is paunchy, with
a scar from a bullet wound on his side. Halle has tattoos
like a longshoreman and traces of an athletic past lost to
beer and schnitzel. Miss Huller steps into view behind Ven-
degast and Tanner. The women recline in their chairs, chat-
ting over what they like.

AN IMAGE flashes in Susie’s head next: Detective Halle raised
up in some kind of web. His mouth is covered with it, so he
is silent. He hangs in a restless void, in some kind of sus-
tained animal release.

Susie steps back out of view, jolted by these images. Sara
hasn’t seen what she’s seen, so Susie steers her back toward
the staircase to the first floor. Susie looks back once, but
says nothing.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

Susie and Sara are in rehearsal. Caroline smokes between
them. Madame Blanc is walking among them. Miss Mandel and
Miss Millius are also there.

BLANC
Now that you’re warmed up, I want
to tell you some news that might ex-
cite you: In addition to putting on
VOLK this fall, we will start work-
ing on something new. Of my own.

This causes a frisson of excitement among the dancers.

BLANC (CONT'D)
And there’s no protagonist in this
dance. Instead, we have five equal
main parts, and an equal number of
secondary parts. Today, we'll im-
provise, by my direction, with Mis-—
ses Mandel and Millius.
(MORE )
44,

BLANC (CONT'D)
Caroline, Sonia, and Sara also come
up. You are the five.

Caroline, Sara, and Sonia step forward. Susie watches, wait-
ing, already knowing there will be something for her.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Susie you will improvise with no
direction. I’m interested in your
instincts here. Consider yourself a
radical libre, moving around the
others as you choose.

Susie comes forward. Everyone around her is experiencing a
shift in attitude about her. The creator has chosen her muse
and, as members of a company, the others must abide. But one
can feel how badly they wanted it to be them, to be close to
Blanc, and if not her, than close now to Susie.

BLANC (CONT'D)
There are basic nine movements to
use. Miss Mandel will show you--

SUSIE
What is the piece called?

. BLANC
“OFFNEN WEIDER." “OPEN AGAIN."

CUT TO:

All six dancers are in motion. The five principals are ina
formation, a kind of rotating crown, pulsing in and out.

Susie darts among them. Within her improvisation, she finds
herself paying increasing attention to the floor. She comes
to one particular spot, dances over it, comes to it again.

Finally, she finds herself reaching out to it, touching the
spot, putting her torso on it, then her face. It’s strange.

Blanc is watching her closely, wondering what could be prompt-
ing this. Then it dawns on her. She shoots a look at Tanner,
who levels a mildly defiant look back. Then Blanc looks back
at the spot on the floor.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, BLANC’S OFFICE -- DAY

Blanc has brought Miss Tanner to her office. She is enraged.

BLANC
<< You should have told me. >>
45.

MISS TANNER
<< Why? Mother wanted it. She
wanted to feel Susie for herself.
Be in the same space. >>

BLANC
<< I thought we agreed to stop
using that title. >>

MISS TANNER
<< Markos is and will always be our
Mother. >>

BLANC
<< It’s offensive. If Markos was
truly a Mother, we wouldn’t need to
save her life. >>

MISS TANNER
<< You should have told her about
Miss Bannion yourself. Now Mother
wants her. >>

BLANC
<< And if Miss Bannion doesn’t want
Markos? Are we to waste another
girl so quickly? >>

MISS TANNER
<< You mean waste another dancer.
You were going to keep her for your-
self, Blanc. Or is it that you
don’t want Markos to survive? >>

BLANC
<< I want what’s best for all. >>

MISS TANNER

<< Everyone voted. You are not the
light we chose to follow. If Markos
wants this girl, you must prepare
her. >>

(sincerely)
<< Markos will live. We found the
girl in time. >>

 

A beat. It’s not exactly how she would put it.

BLANC
<< I won’t rush again. I will tell
Markos when the girl is ready. She
must be made to be willing. I will

not do it any other way. >>
46.

INT. STAIRWAY/RESIDENTS’ CORRIDOR, MARKOS COMPANY -- DAY

After rehearsal, Susie and Sara walk back to their corridor.
Susie is a little disturbed.

SARA
Something in the sequence-- the
ones-to-twos. I’ve never seen her
use those moves that way before.
(beat)
It’s exquisite. The whole thing.

SUSIE
Did anything-- happen to you dur-
ing it?

SARA

What do you mean?

SUSIE
You didn’t feel someone there?

SARA
Someone?

Susie considers this. She says, more to herself.

SUSIE
It was Markos.

A beat. Sara looks at her.

SARA
What made you say that?

SUSIE
I don’t know.

SARA
(louder than she means)
So why say it?

SUSIE
I didn’t mean to make you upset--
SARA
It’s just--
(beat)

It’s the sort of thing Patricia
would say. Don’t start bugging out
at nothing, too. I couldn’t handle
it.

They get to their floor and stop at the top of the stairs.
47.

Suddenly there is a SCREAM in one of the room. EXCITED PANIC.
Sara and Susie go toward it, alarmed. They see girls racing
to their rooms.

SARA (CONT’D)
What’s going on?!

One of the dancers, MARKETA (20s), tells them, breathlessly.

MARKETA
Bowie’s doing a surprise concert
tonight at S036! For “Helden”! It
was just on the radio--
(almost hysterical)
If we stand a chance of getting in
we've got to go now!

Sara runs for her room. Sonia and Caroline come marching down
the hall in ruffled coats, all glossed up now. Sonia screams:

SONIA
“THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THOSE WHO
CAN HEAR IT COMING!!!"

CUT TO:

INT. CLUB SO36 -- NIGHT

The girls are crammed into the intimate venue, under racks of
hot lights, thirty feet from DAVID BOWIE (30), who is in the
middle of “Beauty and the Beast.”

DAVID BOWIE
That's my kind of highroad, gone
wrong. My-my, smile at least. You
can't say no to the Beauty and the
Beast.

The crowd is hopping up and down the beat, more of less in
unison. The others are ecstatic, but Susie is having trouble
staying in the moment. She’s hearing BREATHING, SIGHS, even
here.

DAVID BOWIE (CONT'D)
Something in the night. Something
in the day. Nothing is wrong. But
something's in the way.

She covers her ears, but the SIGHS remain.

CUT TO:
48.

EXT. BERLIN, STREET -- NIGHT

The girls walk home from the concert, excited, sated. They
come to a platz across which they can see cafes. Sara notices
the dance matrons sitting outside one and points.

THEIR POV: Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, Miss Millius, Miss Man-
del, Miss Huller, Pavla, Miss Vendegast, and a few others,

are gathered around cafe tables pushed together, having an ev-
ening as well. They are brazenly unfashionable. All of Berlin
goes on around them, taking no notice.

EXT. BERLIN, CAFE -- NIGHT

None of the women turn to look at the girls across the
street, but they know they are there. Madame Blanc tells the
others:

BLANC
<< It’s good for her to see us like
this. That we’re still part of the
world. >>

MISS TANNER
(casually)
<< She’s already seen a lot. >>

MISS MILLIUS
<< Seen with her heart. Maybe she
even senses what’s coming. It’s not
far off now. >>

MISS MANDEL
<< What about the witness? It is
not too early to discuss this.
Who'll be our witness there? >>

MISS MILLIUS
<< One of our new friends from the
Polizei? >>

MISS HULLER
<< I like the younger one. >>

They laugh all over again. Miss Huller is a bit more serious
about the question.

MISS HULLER (CONT’D)
<< We’re forgetting. We already
have a witness. >>

CUT TO:
49.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SARA'S ROOM -- NIGHT

The muffled sound of WOMEN LAUGHING, returning from a night
out, can be heard in Sara’s room. Sara is not quite asleep.
She hears it. It sounds like it’s coming from the opposite
direction than the hallway, though.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SUSIE’S ROOM -- NIGHT

Susie is deeply, almost hypnotically, asleep now, deep in a
dream.

INT. MUTTERHAUS, THE ROOM OF HOLES -- NIGHT (DREAM)

Susie is naked, sitting on the floor, legs spread, knees up,

chest-to-back in a tight line with the other girls. She can’t
move her arms. She looks and sees the floor is full of smooth
holes cut out of the wooden studio floor. Women are reaching

up from below through the holes to hold the girls’ wrists so

they cannot get up.

The room is enormous and dim, but Susie can see other matrons
around them, staying a few steps back. The other girls are
getting increasingly panicked. Some are crying, begging to be
let free.

A sound is in the room with them. A wet, diseased breathing.

At the front of the line, a woman floats forward. She is
three feet off the ground. She spreads her robes and her hea-
vyset, aged torso can be vaguely seen in the dark. Something
is dripping from between her legs. As she levitates over the
first girl--robes sliding over the girl’s shoulders--the girl
turns her face away from the dripping coming from above, re-
pulsed and afraid. So does the next girl, and the next. The
women on the periphery are chanting in the whisper:

WITCHES
“Mother Is! Mother Is! Mother Is!”

Susie is trying to fight down her own panic. She’s shaking.
The Mother approaches just overhead. Susie makes a decision:
She throws back her head, opens her mouth, sticks out her ton-
gue to receive the blood.

BACK TO:
INT. SUSIE'S ROOM, MARKOS COMPANY -- NIGHT

Susie shouts, with urgency and defensiveness:

SUSIE
I know who I am. I KNOW who I AM!
50.

Sara is suddenly there, shaking Susie awake.

SARA
It’s all right. It’s all right!

Susie is awake in a snap, able to separate things quickly.
Caroline and another dancer, DOLL (30) stick their sleepy
faces in as well.

CAROLINE
Is she all right?

SARA
Just a nightmare.

DOLL
The Markos Company special. I’m
surprised it took this long.

They disappear from the door.

SUSIE
I’m sorry. I’m-- Did I wake you up?

SARA
I was coming back from the toilet.
You scared the hell out of me,
though.
(beat)
Move over.

A beat before she realizes Sara is serious. Susie scoots over
to make room in the bed.

SUSIE
I never had a sleepover. Just my
sisters--

SARA

Well, we’re sisters now aren’t we?
Sara closes her eyes, happy, and tries to fall back into it.

SUSIE
First one back to sleep wins.

Susie keeps her eyes open, alert. She’s jolted. And learning.
CUT TO:
EXT. EAST BERLIN, FRIEDRICHSTRABE -- DAY

Klemperer sits at his small fountain in the stonework, finish-
ing his breakfast ritual. He gets up and says to the air:
51.

KLEMPERER
<< Tomorrow, then. >>

INT. TRANENPALAST -- DAY

Klemperer waits to come back into West Berlin in the Soviet-
run “Palace of Tears,” named so for all the tearful goodbyes
of family, friends, and lovers separating again to two sides
of a wall that may not permit any further reunions.

Klemperer, who does not have this particular kind of tears,
just waits to be let through.

INT. BUNDESKRIMINALAMT, WAITING AREA -- DAY

Back in West Berlin, Klemperer waits in the reception area of
a Federal Criminal Police Station. The waiting room is pack-
ed.

A TELEVISION hanging from the ceiling shows footage of the
hijacked Lufthansa at yet another airport. Now it’s in Mogadi-
shu.

Klemperer sits in front of a row of posters with a BKA logo
at the top and the headline “TERRORISTEN.” They feature pho-
tos of dozens and dozens of men and women, some with names,
others with question marks. Some are crossed out. There’s a
photo that looks a lot like Patricia, which is not crossed
out.

INT. BUNDESKRIMINALAMT, AGENT'S OFFICE -- DAY

Klemperer sits down with BKA AGENT ALBRECHT (40) and AGENT
GLOCKNER (40). Any person passing in the hall causes the a-
gents to glance up as if they are waiting to be summoned to
breaking news. But each person passes by.

A crucifix hangs on the wall. One of the Agents is a religi-
ous man.

KLEMPERER
<< The officers said they found no-
thing amiss. But I-- feel, perhaps,
they never went. >>

AGENT ALBRECHT
<< It’s not really your place to
speculate on that. Do we agree? >>

Klemperer knows how to respond to questions like these. He
looks at the desk and nods.

AGENT ALBRECHT (CONT’D)
<< You say it’s a dance school? >>
52.

KLEMPERER
<< Not a school, but yes, for dance-
rs. >>

AGENT ALBRECHT
<< She’d been threatened there? >>

Klemperer thinks for a moment how to answer.

KLEMPERER

<< I think it’s more. She had a de-
lusion about there being a coven of
witches at the company. She had
this delusion for months. >>

(beat)
<< At the center was a woman she
called “Mother Markos.” It only
just occurred to me since she has
been missing that her delusion
could be real. >>

Agent Glockener smiles, irritated. Klemperer does not.

AGENT ALBRECHT
<< You believe in witches, Doctor?
(beat)
Do you understand the kind of week
we're having? >>

KLEMPERER
<< Not the element about witches,
but the one about a organization
operating in secret. >>

This pulls the agents’ attention in. They stop tracking
what’s going on in the corridor and give Klemperer their full
attention.

KLEMPERER (CONT’D)
<< I’ve written the names of women
she mentioned specifically. >>

He pulls a slip from his wallet and gives it to them. We see
the names “Mandel,” “Millius,” “Huller,” “Tanner,” “Blanc”
and, of course “Markos.”

AGENT ALBRECHT
<< And Miss Hingle. Did she have
political affiliations, too? >>

Klemperer lies with ease about this.
53.

KLEMPERER
<< Not to my knowledge.
(beat)
I just want to be certain she is
safe. >>

CUT TO:
INT. BUNDESKRIMINALAMT, CORRIDOR -- DAY
Agent Glockner escorts Klemperer out.
AGENT GLOCKNER
<< You did right to come. If you
see Miss Hingle call us immediate-
ly. But we’ll look into this. >>
Klemperer says through a joyless smile:
KLEMPERER
<< This isn’t the first time we've
met, Agent Glockner. >>
Glockner just looks at him, not making a connection.
KLEMPERER (CONT’D)
<< You were a police officer in
Schéneberg, yes? You helped me try
to locate my wife. >>
He looks at Klemperer, suspicious now.

GLOCKNER
<< Your wife also went missing? >>

KLEMPERER
<< Two years before the Russian
charge. >>
Glockner’s suspicion fades and is replaced by a kind of pity.
KLEMPERER (CONT’D)
<< Anke Zisman. 1943. From the
records, you helped me cross off
Poland. I am still grateful. >>
CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

The company is rehearsing “VOLK.” They dance a long portion
without stopping.
54.

Some of the dancers are wearing different costume prototypes.
Miss Huller, the production designer, stands with Blanc, com-
menting on the nuances of each option.

Susie is refining every move. She is pushing out of a sa-
vant’s intuition into her choreographer’s intention.

All the dancers are tuned in, but getting exhausted. They
reach a place where Blanc calls a stop. She immediately comes
over to Susie to confer.

BLANC
Part of a jump is muscle, and that
will improve as you condition, Su-
sie, but you have an aversion to
them and I don’t know why. You’re
happy to be stuck to the Earth?

Some of the dancers laugh. Susie does as well. She shakes her
head.

BLANC (CONT'D)

There is a yield before the push
you aren’t quite understanding. Car-
oline-- Do a series, please. Susie
watch closely.

Caroline does several jumps in succession.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Now you.

Susie attempts the same moves. They are not as high or as pre-
cisely articulated.

SUSIE
(frustrated)
What I really want is to be on the
floor here anyway.

BLANC
Of course you do. You're mistaking
a limitation for an artistic prefer-
ence.

SUSIE
At this point, the jumps are oppos-
ing the pull of the structure, but
it’s soon for that, no? The rolls
and ground moves are keeping the o-
ther dancers pushed down--
(beat)

This could echo that on a slightly
higher point of elevation.
55.

Susie does a grotesque, fast crawling lope over the floor. It
is a truly strange movement. Blanc watches her, not defensive-
ly, but really listening.

SUSIE (CONT'D)

If I stayed close to the ground now
and went straight into the leaps
where you have them later, isn’t
that more to the point? The resis-—
tance is more desperate, no?

A beat as Blanc considers, then rejects this.

BLANC
Your insight’s impressive. Your
interpretation, less so.

Susie waits for more, still catching her breath.

BLANC (CONT'D)

This dance came out of living in
Berlin during the Reich, something
you have no way of climbing inside.
If you think I’m indicating levels
of resistance with levels of height
you've not only misunderstood the
dance, but my character as well.

Susie concedes with a nod.

BLANC (CONT'D)
You may become a great choreogra-
pher. But not before you are a
great dancer. Let’s get you in the
air first.

(beginning again)
Allez!

CUT TO:

After rehearsal, the dancers pick up their things and begin
filing out. Blanc packs up her bag, her back to everyone. Sa-
ra goes to Susie.

SARA
We're going to the Ufer for coffee.

BLANC
(without turning)
Susie, hold on a moment--

A beat. Susie looks at Blanc’s back, and shrugs to Sara. Sara
gives her a supportive smile and heads out with the others.
56.

We then watch Blanc’s face in closeup We see the dancers lea-
ving over her shoulder.

As they go: Caroline collapses in the doorway and begins sei-
zing. Blanc turns and rushes to her side. She has to climb o-
ver Caroline's jerking legs and torso to get out in the hall
where the girl’s head is. Blanc keeps her from swallowing her
tongue.

The other dancers watch from both out in the hall and inside
the studio, alarmed, helpless.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENCE CORRIDOR -- DAY
Sara, Sonia, and Marketa look in on Caroline. She’s propped
up in bed, with color in her cheeks. DR. BISCHOFFS (50s) is

there, consulting with Miss Vendegast.

The girls pull on their coats and head downstairs. Susie is
nowhere around.

EXT. MARKOS COMPANY -- DAY

Sara, Sonia, and Marketa come out into the sunlight and cold
and enter the flow of the sidewalk traffic.

SONIA
She hit her head hard. I heard it.
I hope nothing comes of that.

MARKETA
She doesn’t eat enough. We all tell
her.

They get only a quarter of a block before an old man stands
up from a bench and steps forward. It’s Dr. Klemperer.

KLEMPERER
I'm looking for a dancer. From your
Markos company--

MARKETA
Who are you looking for?

But he already knows the answer. He steps up to Sara.

KLEMPERER
You are Sara?
57.

Marketa and Sonia look at Sara, who is looking at Klemperer
trying to place him. She has no idea who he is.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, CORRIDOR -- DAY

Madame Blanc brings Susie a little further into the company.
Susie is doing an admirable job of hiding her nerves, having
no idea what is about to happen next. Blanc says, mildly:

BLANC
Certainly, part of the issue is--
and always is--not being able to
see your body in space. One angle,
in a mirror, or even on film, is
not enough.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “MIRRORED” STUDIO -- DAY

Blanc brings Susie into a small, pitch black studio and turns
on the lights. Susie sees reflections of herself and Blanc ev-
erywhere she turns. She smiles.

This is the same studio where Olga was killed. The parquet is
recently polished. The mirrors clean and streakless.

BLANC
There’s a reason the tour en l’air
is mostly given to men in ballet.
They have the strength to achieve
it. But it’s wrong to think of the
goal as height. The goal is having
enough space under you. Your two-to-
twos are very close to fine, but
the one-to-ones you have to think
of differently. Every movement that
takes air must be a coup de foudre.

SUSIE
I don’t understand what that means.

BLANC
A strike of lightning! A bolt of
sudden love, actually. Graham used
to say: “Every dance is a fever
chart. A graph of the heart.”

Though she is explaining, Blanc is being more vulnerable than
a teacher would be. It carries a very light erotic charge.

SUSIE
That’s beautiful. Your dances are
beautiful like that.
58.

BLANC
No, Susie. Never. There are two
things dance cannot be anymore--
“cheerful,” and “beautiful.” We are
women, aren’t we. We must break the
nose of every beautiful thing.

Susie nods, trying to understand. She looks at the floor and,

for one moment, she sees the parquet in a jumble of pieces as

it must have looked when it was being laid, then rotting from
disrepair. These images come in a flash and then are gone. Su-
sie catches her breath.

BLANC (CONT'D)
(directly)

If you’re going to dance, you must

learn one of the languages of

dance. It should be French. You’1l

never learn Russian if you’re only

starting now. You’d go insane--
(beat)

Are you warm enough here?

SUSIE
Yes, thank you.

BLANC
Stretch if you need to. Otherwise
let's watch you jump, here, where
you can see every angle.

Susie readies herself and tries a jump. It is inches higher.
Blanc watches her closely to see if she understands what has
happened. Susie tries again and can feel the difference.

Susie is clearly understanding something. Something momentous
has happened. Her jumps look exactly like Caroline’s in their
form. They may in fact somehow be Caroline's.

This is a crucial moment and Blanc knows it. If Susie backs
away from what’s happening, all is lost. But Susie looks her
in the eye and tells her:

SUSIE
You see? Sometimes I only need to
be told twice.

Blanc’s relief is huge. She laughs, delighted, and in her
laugh, you can see the young woman she must’ve been at Su-
sie’s age. Susie can’t help but laugh as well.

INT. BERLIN, CAFE IN THE TIERGARTEN -- DAY

Sara has accompanied Dr. Klemperer into the Tiergarten where
they sit at a window table that looks out onto the park.

ON A TV: The news is showing Lufthansa flight 181 on the air-
strip in Mogadishu. The dead body of one of the hostages is
unceremoniously tossed down to the tarmac.

The other patrons in the restaurant are watching this, their
backs to Klemperer and Sara.

KLEMPERER
She said she was going to come back
for you. That she’d left a note--

Sara shakes her head, touched even in her confusion.

SARA
I don’t know what to make of any of
this. I know the kind of thing she
was involved with, but I don’t see
how any of it could be happening in-
side the company.

KLEMPERER
She describes it in terms of a revo-
lutionary movement in a moment of
crisis. A crisis of leadership, and
mandate. Stay underground, or come
out in force. Stasis, reinvestion,
or extinction.

SARA

I live there. I have friends there.
I don’t see any evidence of this at
all.

(beat)
No one has ever approached me, or
any of the other girls as far as I
know--

KLEMPERER
Read this.

Klemperer takes out Patricia’s yellow notebook. He turns to a
particular passage and waits for Sara to read it. She does,
and then looks up at him in surprise.

SARA
But this says “witches.”

Klemperer puts his hands together, as if grounding himself.
60.

KLEMPERER

Mother Markos. Mother Meinhoff.
Dance rehearsal, political action,
paranoia. In Patricia's life, these
things were of equal influence. And
that is how transferences happens,
how delusions are made. A delusion
is a truth that tells a lie, Sara.

(beat)
Patricia’s fantasies might have
been her way of processing another
form of oppression or intellectual
manipulation.

SARA
The company is a --family. There’s
a lot of love there.

KLEMPERER
Love and anarchy have lived in the
same houses for centuries. They are
forever friends.

SARA
I sorry. I don’t see this.

KLEMPERER
There may be things the police
missed. Patricia talks about whole
secret parts of the building. Actu-
al rooms that are hidden--

Sara looks at him, putting something together. But she dis-
misses it immediately.

KLEMPERER (CONT’D)
--where a chapter could meet, or a
cell could use as its base.

But Sara gets up and collects her purse.

KLEMPERER (CONT’D)
Miss--

SARA
I don’t want to be disrespectful,
Doctor. I don’t. But you’re asking
me and I’m telling you: It’s a
dance company. We are not talking
about anything else. I’m sorry.

KLEMPERER
Look harder.
61.

SARA
Thank you for caring about Patric-
ia. But I hope you don’t come
again.

She leaves. Klemperer can’t run after her, so he is forced to
watch her stride off. She doesn’t look back.

EXT. BERLIN, TIERGARTEN -- DAY

Sara walks far enough away to be out of Klemperer’s view be-
fore she slows down again. She rubs her neck, looking very
unsure and alone.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, BASEMENT LAUNDRY ROOM -- DAY

Sonia and Doll are in the company basement using the washing
machines in the costume department to do their personal wash.
Caroline is with them, back on her feet. They are talking o-
ver the NOISE of the machines.

DOLL
If they aren’t already, they will
be. I’ve never see Blanc take to a
girl like this.

CAROLINE
Still, she is good.

DOLL
She's good, but she’s a péquenaud.

SONIA
I heard she’s from some kind of re-
ligious family. From Pennsylvania--

Sonia glances behind her and sees Caroline is on the floor a-
gain, seizing even harder this time.

CUT TO:
EXT. BERLIN, POTZDAMER PLATZ -- DAY
Berliners coming home from work are treated to an odd site:
A dozen of the Markos company matrons have come out in start-

ling costumes of black crepe that begin high over their heads
and flow to the ground. Their faces are hidden.
62.

They have put out the Markos Company’s insignia with a time
and date below it on the pavement and perform a public dance
to advertise the company’s performance of “VOLK,” happening
in one week’s time. They chant, to a SLOW DRUM:

MATRONS
COME, COME, COME and SEE. COME and
SEE the DAUGHTERS.

As dance, it is something subtle and new. As an invitation,
it is a little unnerving. They do gather a crowd, however.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENTS’ CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Most of the dancers have gone to bed. It is just before mid-
night.

There are a few still brushing their teeth, brushing out
their hair for the night, writing letters. The last laugh of
the night can be heard, the last switching off of a RADIO.
One of two more doors shut for the night.

Sara down the corridor with her shower bucket and sees: There
is no light under Susie’s door. She almost knocks.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SARA'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Sara sits up in her desk chair, trying not to fall asleep.

She nods off, then snaps awake. She pinches herself, hard. Fi-
nally, she hears what she has been waiting for: MUTED SOUNDS
and VOICES like the other night. She gets up and goes to put
her ear on the wall.

It's there, behind the wall. She moves to one corner and goes
on her knees to listen in the corner. It’s louder there. Then
the voices behind the wall pass the room. Sara marks the spot
where she’s listening and the quickly follows the voices.
They climbs up the wall until she loses them at the top of
the other side.

What’s hidden between her and Susie’s room is a stairway.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENCE CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Sara comes out to the corridor that links the two residents’
hallways. She stands at the midpoint between her room and Su-
sie’s. The shaded hall sconces are turned on low, but it’s e-
nough for her to see.

Starting at this midway point, she walks toward the shadowy
main stairway and counts her steps.
63.

SUSIE
--39. 40. 41. 42.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

She comes down a floor and counts steps leading back in the
same direction. She hits a wall is inside the recessed door
of a big exercise room. The recess is deep, about four feet.
The stairway must keep descending.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

She comes down one more floor and counts her 42 steps. She
ends up at the door to the “mirrored” studio.

The company isn’t heated as warmly at night and she is shi-
vering in just her nightgown. She goes in, but does not turn
on the light until she shuts the door behind her.

The light can be seen in the crack under the door.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “MIRRORED” STUDIO -- NIGHT

Sara knows more or less which mirrored section of wall to go
to from inferring where the secret stairs come down. She
tries pushing on it, pulling. She runs a finger as far into
the crack between mirrors as she can. Nothing moves or sug-
gests movement, until she tries the lip of the wainscotting,
which pulls up as if on a hinge. And then the whole wall pan-
el opens like a door.

INT. MUTTERHAUS, FIRST ROOM -- NIGHT

Sara has to open the door wide to let in the light from the
“mir-rored” studio enough to see. This is a small room with
elegant shelves on every wall.

On the shelves are not the stacks of anarchist fliers, lamina-
ting machines for fake documents, and firearms she might have
been expecting. What she finds are dozens of objects made of
silver or porcelain.

Some are figurative: a trio of women, some mythical beasts, a
dog. Some vaguely echo body parts and genitals. Some look to
be tools for some arcane function or another.

There is a smaller wooden door opposite the entrance which
must be where the staircase begins. Sara tries it, but this
one is locked. She can hear air rushing under the crack be-
neath it. The SOUND is hypnotic.

Feeling like she’s already overstayed a prudent amount of
time, she takes one of the objects from the shelves--a silver
hook--and steps back out into the studio.
64.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “MIRRORED” STUDIO -- NIGHT

She closes up the door and makes sure it’s flush with the
mirrored panel beside it. Then she hides the silver hook in
her nightgown, turns off the light and goes out.

CUT TO:
EXT. BERLIN, STREETS -- DAY

On the street, Berliners heading to work watch TELEVISIONS in
a display window. A German Special Forces unit boarded Luft-
hansa flight 181 in the night, killed three of the four hi-
jackers, and apprehended the last. The hostages are in the
air again, this time heading home to Germany where they will
be received with a heroes’ welcome.

INT. BERLIN, OFFICES -- DAY

Workers who have arrived early to their offices are gathered
around TELEVISIONS there when the news breaks that all of the
RAF prisoners at Mannheim Prison were just discovered dead in
their cells after an apparent “suicide pact.”

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SONIA’S ROOM -- DAY

Dancers from the company are watching this news in their pa-
jamas, on a TELEVISION set Olga left behind. Some are crying.
Sonia says, to no one:

SONIA
That’s it for Hanns-Martin Schley-
er. They’ve got no reason to return
him alive now.

Susie is the first to notice:

SUSIE
Where’s Sara?

CUT TO:
EXT. FRIEDRICHSTRABE -- DAY
Sara is following directions she’s written out. She turns off
a main street and into the little alley that ends at Klemper-
er’s building.
INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- DAY
Sara and Dr. Klemperer are in his study. Every now and then
Frau Sesame glances at them, but they’re far away and speak-

ing English. She sees Sara take an odd silver hook out of her
backpack.
65.

INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, SITTING ROOM -- DAY
Sara is listening to Klemperer intently.

KLEMPERER
She wrote of “Three Mothers” lost
to time, predating all Christian in-
vention. Pre-Devil. They are the
source of all energy and chaos:
Mother Tenebrarum, Mother Lachryma-
rum, and Mother Suspiriorum. Dark-
ness, Tears, and Sighs.

SARA
I saw likenesses of them in the
room last night. In porcelain. Very
fine things. They have money.

KLEMPERER
Patricia named Markos as a devotee
of the Three Mothers, and who, in
fact, thought she was one of them
for a time, but who is now ill and
dying.

Sara bites her thumbnail. She sees the photograph of Klemper-
er’s wife on the bookshelf. She takes it in, then looks away.

KLEMPERER (CONT’D)
Patricia thought they were trying
to recruit her. Groom her. For a
place in the matriarchy. That is
how Patricia described their goal:
Change violent enough to take us
back to a time of matriarchies. The
question was whether to enact this
change in moderation from the sha-
dows, or step into a new era of pub-
lic work and constant recruitment.
She talks about “Markosites” who
were for the formers and “Blanc-—
ites” who were for the later.

SARA
(horrified, disappointed)
Madame Blanc is involved in this?

Sara looks at the silver hook now lying on the table. In the
full light of day, it just seems bizarre.

SARA (CONT’D)
Do they think they are witches?
66.

KLEMPERER

I do not believe in magic. People
can organize themselves to perpe-
trate an evil and call it magic.
That I can believe. And you can
give someone your delusion. That’s
religion-- That was the Reich--

(beat)
The Reich had these things, too.
Esoteric insignia. Esoteric ritual.
The important thing is that what
you found points to some kind of un-
derground organization inside the
company. These three “Mothers”
could simply be code names for
founding members, their histories
metaphoric.

(beat)
I think you’re living with very dan-
gerous people, Sara. Incindiaries.

SARA
Then Patricia could still be in
there. In the building, I mean.
They could be holding her--

KLEMPERER
I cannot promise the authorities
will come to look at a closet full
of porcelain and one locked door.
Not this week, of all weeks. So
stay safe. Alert. Until they come.

Sara begins to gather her things. Klemperer puts a hand on
her arm.

KLEMPERER (CONT'D)

(re: the hook)
In fact, leave this here, or put it
back. But don’t let them find it on
you, Sara.

Sara thinks it over. She stands and shakes Klemperer’s hand.
She leaves it on the table and goes.

EXT. BERLIN, PLATZ -- DAY

Heading home, Sara skirts another protest. This one is get-
ting out of control. The police are no longer at a distance
taking photos. They are at attention with riot shield and
guns ready on their hips.

The crowd waves photos of Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe. They’re
all screaming:
67.

CROWD
<< MURDER!!! MURDER!!! MURDER!!! >>

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, MAIN STAGE -- DAY

The tech team, led by MISS KAPLITT (50s), is building the set
for the production of VOLK. Lighting is being rigged and test-
ed. A small house orchestra is rehearsing.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, DRESSING HALL -- DAY

The dancers are getting fittings and haircuts in preparation.
Sara is getting her costume altered. Behind her, Miss Marks
is cutting Susie’s hair in silence.

The chattier MISS BALFOUR (40s) is trimming Caroline’s hair,
talking to Caroline in French.

MISS CHALISE

<< Madam wants no bangs on anyone
this year. I asked her how am I
supposed to remove them if a girl
has cut them this way already? She
did not have an answer, of course,
as she does not cut hair. But, the
Madame wants the Madame wants, and
so I must do. Thank God you do not
have them. >>

Caroline is beginning to tear up, looking more and more des-
perate. Susie watches this in her mirror. What's going on? Ev-
ery word of Miss Chalise seems to be confusing her more.

MISS CHALISE (CONT’D)
<< You used to wear bangs when you
first arrived, no?

(waiting for her answer)
Did I dream that up? >>

Finally, Caroline pulls off her salon cape and rushes from
the room. Sara looks at Susie in the mirror, then runs after
her. Susie watches them go.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, BASEMENT CORRIDOR -- DAY

Sara catches up with Caroline, who has hidden in one of the
basement practice rooms and backed into a corner. She is cry-
ing so hard, Sara can barely understand her. Sara takes both
her hands.

SARA
What is it?!
68.

CAROLINE
Parts of me --are just falling off.
Tomorrow I might not even be able
to talk at all, or dance, or even
remember who I am!

SARA
You have a condition--

Caroline looks at her, incredulous.

CAROLINE
I've never had seizures before this
week!

Sara has only seen the one in rehearsal.

SARA
You’ve had more than one? What did
they say at the hospital?

CAROLINE
I didn’t go to a hospital. Blanc
brought a doctor to me.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, DRESSING HALL -- DAY

Susie watches in the mirror as Caroline’s hair is swept up
and thrown into a garbage pail. Then she watches Miss Marks
sweeps hers up, but the woman carries the dust pan full of it
out of the room.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

The full company rehearses VOLK, spread across the stage like
a community in tatters, which groups up and falls apart in a
syncopated rhythm to the score. Even amid the dance, Sara is
now paying closer attention to Madame Blanc.

She watches as Susie makes all of her jumps and landings. And
Blanc says nothing about it.

Sara is trying to think of any other interpretation, frantic
to explain what she is seeing any other way. When the dance
breaks for a moment, Blanc steps in to give Susie an adjust-
ment. She can’t hear the note clearly. But she can hear it’s
in French.
69.

When she looks back to Blanc, Blanc glances over at Sara as
she has a million times, but this time it feels ambiguous and
terrifying.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, CORRIDOR/“WHITE” STUDIO -- DAY

When the girls come back through the corridor, Sara appears,

grabs Susie’s hand. She pulls her into the “White” studio out
of view and earshot of another. This is the room where Susie

first auditioned.

SARA
Is it true? After all? Is it true--
(beat)
TELL ME.

SUSIE
Sara, calm down--

SARA

And don’t lie! Are you making some
kind of bargain of your own with
them?

(beat)
How can you know what things
they'll ask of you in return?! What
horrible things! Please tell me
it’s not too late--

SUSIE
Whatever you have in your mind,
nothing’s wrong. Look at me! Sara!

SARA
You're lying right now.

Sara pleads her with her eyes, frightened and heartsick.
Susie takes her hands, smiling, reassuring her.

SUSIE
Nothing horrible is happening, or
will happen--

SARA
You just haven’t gotten the bill.

SUSIE
Nothing’s wrong. Believe me. Every-
one’s wound up right now. Don’t let
it get to you, too.

Sara wants badly to believe her.
70.

Susie hugs her, and Sara lets her. But Susie’s private expres-
sion reveals Sara’s words have sunk in.

PRIEST (V.O.)

Is any among you sick? Let him call
for the elders of the church; and
let them pray over him, anointing
him with oil in the name of the
Lord.

CUT TO:
EXT. OHIO FARMHOUSE, ADULTS’ BEDROOM -- DAY

A MENNONITE PRIEST (40s) is praying at the bedside of Mrs.
Bannion, sick with advanced cancer as she is in the opening
credits.

PRIEST
And the prayer of faith shall save
him that is sick, and the Lord
shall raise him up; And if he has
committed sins--

Mrs. Bannion interrupts him with three heavy words:

MRS. BANNION
My last- child-

Susie’s sisters, and some of the neighbors who have come to
sit watch over Mrs. Bannion, bristle at this.

PRIEST
It shall be forgiven him--

The TELEPHONE begins RINGING DOWNSTAIRS.

MRS. BANNION

My last child was --my sin. I saw
the Tempter in her and did not see
It --for what It was. She was quiet
in its service for --so long.

(beat)
She is my sin. She is what I have
smeared upon the world--

The TELEPHONE continues RINGING. One of Susie’s twin sisters
NAOMI (20s) upset by what her mother is saying, runs out of
the room to answer.

INT. OHIO FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN -- DAY

The TELEPHONE’s inside a cabinet. Naomi opens it and answers.
71.

NAOMI
(thickly)
Bannion house.

The other end is SILENT, but she can hear other people TALK-
ING, though muffled. It doesn’t sound like English. She sits

up.

NAOMI (CONT'D)
Susanna?

Nothing.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Susanna. Don’t hang up!
(beat)

Are you all right? Everyone is wor-
ried for you. Pastor Pat told moth-
if you come home and return the mon-
ey, you’ll be restored. He forgives
you. Mother forgives you. We all
forgive you.

She listens to the silence on the other end. The faint sound
of other people’s LAUGHTER in the background.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Mother’s uncomfortable all the time
now. She isn’t sleeping. Everyone
is pitching in. The Doders especial-
ly. They come every night.

(beat)
Mother asks for you every day. Ten
times a day. Are you really so far?

(beat)
Do you have nothing to say?

Nothing. Naomi waits a long beat, tears coming to her eyes.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
If you don’t come soon, you won’t
see mother again, Susanna.
(wait, one last beat)

I’m putting down the phone now. I

love you.
And then she hangs up.

BACK TO:

INT. TELECOM CENTER, BERLIN -- DUSK

Susie is in a plexiglas telecom booth, surrounded by Berlin-
ers in the middle of happier calls. She puts her phone down.
72.

She's not crying, but she’s frozen, numb, unsure what to do
to move forward.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, BLANC’S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Madame Blanc is at her desk, writing a letter, when a small
KNOCK comes at her door.

BLANC
Entre.

It is Susie. She steps in and shuts the door. Blanc sees she
is at a turning point. Susie takes off her coat.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Do you want to talk or dance?

SUSIE
Dance.

Madame Blanc gets to her feet.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, BLANC’S STUDIO -- NIGHT

Blanc takes Susie into her private studio, adjacent to her
office. It’s the small, circular studio, with all the lac-—
quered screens. There are no mirrors visible. Susie takes off
her sweater. Says to Blanc, oddly affectless tonight:

SUSIE
Show me something new.

We see Blanc dance for the first time and she talks as she
shows Susie some new movements.

BLANC
Movement is never mute. It is a
language. Most dance is illegible,
made by people who cannot read it.
(beat)

But, in fact, it is a series of
energistic creations written in the
air. Like words forming sentences.
Like poems. Prayers.

SUSIE
Spells--

Blanc ignores this literal nudge for now.
73.

BLANC

And like sentences, a few letters
can be off, or badly written, and
the meaning is still there. And
that is the difference between you
and your sisters here, Susie. I
have no trouble reading you, nor do
the other matrons.

(beat)
We all see you, Susie. All of us.

SUSIE
All of you.

BLANC
To the very top.

Blanc watches Susie react to this with a simple nod. As they
are talking, Blanc begins showing Susie how to move, getting
close to her.

BLANC (CONT'D)
You could be a great, great dancer.
But whose dances you chose to dance
and why will mean everything. Which-
ever dance you choose, you will
create in yourself the image of its
creator, who will need you to empty
yourself out so she can be radical
to her creations and work through
you. Do you understand? Who you do
it for must be your choice, and a
choice you can cherish. Forever.

Blanc moves behind her and raises her arms.

BLANC (CONT'D)
You're in a company now. You must
find your right place. What part of
the company do you want to be? Not
its feet. Other girls can be its
feet. Its head? Its heart? Back-
bone? Its sex?

SUSIE
Its hands. I want to be this com-
pany’s hands.
Blanc seems to like this answer.

CUT TO:
74.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SARA'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Sara lies awake. She hears Susie return for the night. After
a moment, she gets out of bed.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENTS’ CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

She comes around the corner to Susie’s door and sees it is
closed. There is no light under it. She quietly knocks, but
Susie doesn’t answer.

INT. SUSIE'S ROOM, MARKOS COMPANY -- NIGHT
Susie lies in bed, awake. She hears Sara’s voice whisper:

SARA
I’m not leaving you here, Susie.
I’m not leaving without you.

Then she is gone.

This makes the part of Susie who is simply a young woman who
needs her friend smile. She closes her eyes to sleep amid the
BREATHING that has joined her again.

FADE TO BLACK.

ON A TELEVISION: A news story plays about the burials of the
RAF prisoners in a Stuttgart cemetery. Thousands of protest-
ors silently observes the burial. Polizei with machine guns
are posted everywhere.

NEWS REPORTER

<< In response to local protesters
who wanted to keep Baader, Ensslin,
and Raspe from being interred here,
Stuttgart Mayor Manfred Rommel, son
of Field Marshall Irwin Rommel, re-
marked: “I will not accept that
there should be first- and second-
class cemeteries.” He declared, pas-
sionately: “All enmity should cease
after death.”

(beat)
Echoing in a sharper sentiment, BKA
Commissioner Horst Harold told the
press: “The Baader-Meinhoff era is
done. The so-called “German Autumn”
is over.” >>
75.

EXT. BERLIN -- DAY

Fall marches toward winter. Leaves are all in the street now.
CUT TO:

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR -- DAY

Miss Tanner is coming out of Blanc’s office, which she locks
behind her. She is balancing a pile of thin boxes, perfor-
mance gifts for the dancers. All of Tanner’s keys are on a
knotted ribbon. She puts them in her pocket.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, MAIN STAGE -- DAY

Final checks are being done on lights and sound before the
doors are opened to begin letting in audience members for the
company’s performance. All of the dancers and matrons are in
the theatre preparing for the show.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, DRESSING ROOM -- DAY

Susie sits getting her makeup done by Miss Chalice. She sees
Sara is not anywhere around.

SUSIE
Have you seen Sara yet?

MISS CHALISE
She came in early. Wanted her hair
and makeup first. Then she left.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, TECH STAIRS -- DAY

One of the technicians, JUDITH (20s) opens a side door and
finds Miss Tanner on the floor surrounded by boxes. She has
fallen down the stairs, only now just regaining her wits.
Judith helps her sit up.

JUDITH
<< What happened? >>

Tanner touches her head. It’s tender, but there is no blood.

MISS TANNER
<< I must have fallen. >>

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, CORRIDOR -- DAY

Sara comes hurrying down the hall, made up for the perform-
ance, Miss Tanner’s ribbon of keys in her fist as well as a
flashlight. When she gets to door of the “Mirrored” Studio,
she lets herself in and locks it behind her.
76.

INT. MUTTERHAUS, FIRST ROOM -- DAY

Sara lets herself into the first secret room behind the mir-
rored panel and goes to the locked door inside. She begins to
try out keys, one after another. There must be thirty on Miss
Tanner’s ring. Air moving under the door plays a low note a-
cross the jamb.

The door springs open and Sara finds herself looking up a nar-
row, steep stairway. She hesitates only briefly, then goes.

INT. MUTTERHAUS, STAIRWAY -- DAY

The stairway is lit by small electric sconces as she makes
her way up it, silently as she can. It moves upward past her
and Susie’s rooms. Then, when it crests the next floor, it
begins descending again, widening as it goes, becoming some-
thing quite grand by the time it reaches the back part of the
building used by the coven, the “Mutterhaus.”

INT. MUTTERHAUS, THE APPROACH -- DAY

Sara finds herself in a huge, curved arcade that arcs around
before ending at an open archway. The architecture is quickly
morphing into something hyper-organic and fluid, an emphatic
sort of art nouveau.

There is nowhere to hide if she hears anyone coming. Sara is
terrified.

All of the dancers are gathering, made up and costumed.

MISS MILLIUS
Ten minutes! Ten minutes!

Susie is looking around for Sara, who is still not among
them. The girls seem concerned about it, but not the matrons.
Susie grows truly worried.

CUT TO:
EXT. MARKOS COMPANY -- DAY
Klemperer comes up the sidewalk to the company and heads to
the theatre entrance on one side. He is nervous as well. He

shows his ticket to Miss Huller, who gives him a smile and
gestures him inside.
77.

INT. THEATRE, MARKOS COMPANY -- DAY

Miss Mandel escorts Klemperer to his seat. The audience is
filling up to a full house. He regards her, and the other com-
pany women, with what he thinks is a discreet eye. When he
looks around the theatre, he begins to see some of the icon-
ography rendered in Patricia’s journals around him here. It
is unnerving to him.

CUT TO:
INT. THE ROOM OF COMPARTMENTS, MUTTERHAUS -- DAY

Sara comes into a huge tube-shaped room. At the opposite end
is an arch with further rooms beyond. Sara moves forward, but
she notices, all along the walls of this room, are triangle-
shaped recesses in shadow. She stops. She can see in one the
shape of a leg, as if someone is crouching there.

She almost screams, but keeps her wits. Trembling, she slow-
ly goes toward whoever it is, flashlight up, but then, impos-
sibly, someone in another recess calls her name.

PATRICIA (0.S.)
Sara.

The person leans out and Sara can see in her light: It is
Patricia. She runs and kneels at her side. Patricia’s ina
strange state--slow, dry-voiced, and cold to touch.

PATRICIA
I wake up here every day now.

Patricia speaks in a normal voice. Sara’s is hushed.

SARA
Stand up! Come on! I know how to
get out. --Take my jacket.

PATRICIA
She’s inside me. She wants me to
hold you.

Sara pulls Patricia out of the shadow and sees, with horror,
she’s pale. Her eyes are rimmed in pale flesh. Her face is a
dead girl's face, but without the stiffness of death. All her
features hang down. Her jaw is slack.

Sara takes her wrist and checks for a pulse. There must not
be one. Sara begins to cry. Patricia delicately pulls her
wrist out of Sara’s grip and reverses things so that she is
now holding Sara’s wrist.
78.

Someone is coming down the passage Sara’s just come from. She
can hear it.

PATRICIA
They’11 take you now.

Sara panics and tries to get up, but Patricia grips her.

PATRICIA (CONT’D)
She shows me things. On the side of
a coffin I think is my rest. She’s
holding it, holding it back-- Show-
ing me things on the side, like
this--

A new expression comes into his face. Blank and cold. A few
other girls come out from other alcoves, to come hold Sara. A
sound of terror escapes Sara’s lips against her will.

PATRICIA (CONT’D)
A ribbon. For my face. We are ti-
red. We are so tired.

Sara pulls free from Patricia, and runs past the other girls
and through the arch just as the figures of a number of mat-
rons appear in the door Sara came in. She only sees them for
a split second, but they are naked.

INT. MUTTERHAUS, THE ROOM OF HOLES -- DAY

Sara runs into the next room, a dark room, the edges of which
she cannot see. It’s the room about which Susie dreamed, with
the holes in the floor, but Sara doesn’t see them in time.

Within a few steps she puts her leg into one. Her momentum
carries her forward and her shin snaps. She shrieks and crash-
es to the ground.

She awkwardly gets her leg out and begins to back away from
the door, dragging the it along with her. The matrons come in-
to the room and see her injury.

MISS MILLIUS
Keep still, Sara. Lie still.

Some, who are dancers, are in good shape for their ages.
Others, who work in administrative capacities, sag. They are
all smiling, sort of dancing around the holes in the floor. A
few have some of the implements from the first room in their
hands. Sara is frightened to the point to frenzy, but also pa-
ralyzed now somehow. She can’t move at all.

She begs instead.
79.

SARA
FORGIVE ME! PLEASE! I wanted to
help! I DIDN’T KNOW! DON’T DO ANY-
THING--

The matrons come in, with calming voices. Pavla goes about
setting Sara’s leg. It must be very painful, but they hypno-
tize her as they work and she resists less and less.

Finally, Miss Vendegast puts her hands over Sara’s crying
brown eyes.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, MAIN STAGE -- DAY

The dancers take their places on stage behind the curtain,
checking last looks in a mirror there. Susie looks back one
last time and sees: Sara’s place is still empty.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, THEATRE -- DAY

The audience is full, except for one ambiguously empty seat
next to Klemperer. The audience is lit up when the curtain
ascends. The DRUMS begin. He tries to find Sara on the stage
among the company, but can’t.

As the company performs VOLK, we cut back and forth between
the following:

Klemperer realizes Sara is missing. He looks around for her,
finally seeing the only empty seat in the house is next to
him. Some of the company matrons positioned around the room
are watching him casually as much as they are watching the
performance. He realizes this.

Susie slowly lets go of her concern for Sara and becomes the
dance. Everything begins to fade for Susie except the spell
in the air she is creating with her movements, and Blanc who
is in one of the wings connecting with her in her mind. All
is the dance. All is the dance.

The piece is remarkable, giving the audience the feeling of
an entire community shattered, but still functioning. At one
point, Susie rejects the leaps and goes off-book, incorpora-
ting the loping crawl she offered in rehearsal. It’s strange
and upsetting, but galvanizing to the whole.

Miss Tanner, who is standing beside Blanc mutters:
MISS TANNER

<< This girl is ready, Blanc. It’s
time. >>
80.

But beside her, Blanc’s having an orgasm she can barely hide.

Somewhere in the middle of the dance, Sara, flat of affect
and somehow walking on her broken leg, shambles onto the
stage and takes her place in the performance.

NOTE: Astute members of the audience may realize Susie and
Sara have switched eye color. Susie's are now brown, in keep-
ing with what is apparently Madame Blanc's preference, and
Sara's are now blue. It's perverse. Unnecessary. The use of
power to feed a fetish. Patricia had these brown eyes. Olga
had them. And now Susie does as well.

The other dancers make room for Sara, and then, one-by-one,
really see her. Sara’s set, but still-broken, leg is swollen
under her leotard. Dancers close to her can hear the fractur-
ed bones grinding together as she dances. Sara’s face is as
rigid in its expression of calm as a doll’s.

The audience remains unaware, except for Klemperer, who is
watching her too closely not to notice.

Finally, just at the end of the dance, Susie turns and sees
Sara for herself. She stops dancing and takes a step toward
her. As the curtain comes down, Sara collapses.

She falls within sight of one of the “last looks” mirrors.
She sees herself broken, humiliated, dying. She sees that a
change has been made to her face. Her eyes are now blue. Su-
sie’s eyes.

Three things happen at once:

1.) Madame Blanc rushes from the wing and kneels at Sara’s
side. Susie slowly comes over, not wanting to see what
they’ve done to Sara, but drawn by the girl’s suffering.

BLANC
Someone please call Dr. Bischoffs.

2.) As everyone in the audience stands to start shuffling
toward the exits, obtuse to what is going on behind the cur-
tain, TWO PLAINCLOTHES BKA AGENTS, including Agent Albrecht,
begin moving toward the stage, fast.

3.) Klemperer also makes his way toward the stage, ignoring
the matron’s gazes. He climbs up the stairs to the wing as
quickly as he can manage, and from there sees everyone crowd-
ed around Sara. The BKA Agents have taken Miss Tanner aside
and are grilling her, but she discreetly stops both with a
hand.

Klemperer can see Sara looking directly at him through the
chaos of girls around her.
81.

She registers he is there and starts to move her hand, then
her arm, with great effort. She curls her hand back toward
her face and, with one shaking finger, calls his attention to
her now-blue eyes.

He stands there, stunned, facing down what he would have con-
sidered an hour ago to be impossible beyond consideration.

Blanc and Susie see Sara’s attention focus and look to where
she is looking. Klemperer meets their eyes and both Blanc and
Susie know: This is the man who called the police. This is
the man who directed the attention of the BKA to them. This
is the man to whom Patricia referred to them as “witches.”

There is nothing Klemperer can do to help Sara anymore from
these women. So he turns and flees.

CUT TO:
EXT. TIERGARTEN, BERLIN -- NIGHT

Dr. Klemperer walks home through Berlin’s Tiergarten. There
are people out, but the night is coming on windy.

A dog runs up and stops ten feet in front of him, directly in
his path. It has stopped before another dog’s turd, which is
not even dry. The dog pushes the turd toward Klemperer, and
then bares its teeth as if grinning.

Klemperer freezes, waiting to see if the dog will run at him.
It doesn’t. It gallops off into the darkening trees instead.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENTS’ CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

That night is a somber one on the dormitory floor. All the
girls are quiet, many in bed early. Some have left flowers in
Sara’s made bed, or notes and cards.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SUSIE’S ROOM -- NIGHT

Susie lies in bed. At some point, she can hear WOMEN passing
behind the wall. Someone opens her door. It is Blanc. She
comes in and sits on the edge of the bed.

BLANC
Are you frightened, Susie?

SUSIE
No.
(beat)
What will they say happened to
Sara?
82.

BLANC
I was worried about you.

SUSIE
I’m sorry I went off book.

Blanc nearly responds, but finally doesn’t. A beat.

SUSIE (CONT'D)
It’s all a mess, isn’t it? The mess
out there. The one in here. The
mess that’s coming. The mess that
was.

(beat)

Why are people always so ready to
think the worst is over?

BLANC
I could explain it to you. I think
I’d be wrong to, though.

Susie asks suddenly:

SUSIE
Because you love me?

Blanc looks troubled by this, frightened herself.

BLANC
Just close your eyes and sleep. No
more dreams tonight.

Susie takes Blanc’s hand for a moment, squeezes it in thanks,
and says:

SUSIE
For everything.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, “IRIS” STUDIO -- DAY

With VOLK behind them, the company is hard at work on re-
hearsing OPEN AGAIN. Susie is fully in the free radical role.
She is astonishing to watch. Her brown eyes are now a fact of
who she is. No one comments, either by choice or suggestion.

Blanc pushes Susie, as well as the others, very hard. At a
break, she hands out black sashes. Some of the dancers begin
putting them around their waists, but Blanc tells them:

BLANC
I want you to trust your movements,
your placement.

(MORE )
83.

BLANC (CONT'D)
These are for your eyes. Move to
your start marks and put this over
them.

They all go to the top of the dance, find their places, tie
on blindfold, and begins again with the music. It must be ve-
ry difficult, but they are learning it very precisely.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Don’t be afraid of it. Your feet
know where to go.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SUSIE’S ROOM -- DUSK

Something is coming. Energies are gathering and Susie can
feel them. She dresses for dinner and puts on her coat. She
buttons it up to her chin.

CUT TO:
INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, SITTING ROOM -- DUSK

Frau Sesame is in the kitchen, HUMMING and making the soup,
oblivious. She hears the front door close and goes out to
see, with surprise, that Klemperer has left. She calls after
him, down the stairs:

FRAU SESAME
<< But Doctor, it is almost ready!
>>

He doesn’t answer. She comes back inside, perplexed, even a
little afraid.

EXT. BERLIN, PAULSTRABE -- DUSK

Klemperer comes down a dark street and onto a bridge over the
River Spree. He is struggling under the weight of something
he is carrying over his shoulders. It is Patricia’s duffle.
Her other bag is in his hand.

It’s a cold enough night that he can see the edges of the riv-
er icing up, so he goes further out to the middle of the span
over black churning water.

He flips the bag and duffle over the side and listens to them
splash below. Only then does he look to see they’re gone. He
takes the silver body hook out of his coat and throws it into
the Spree as well. Then he begins to cry. He is a man who can
only feel guilt as he again watches evil approaching.

CUT TO:
84.

EXT. BERLIN, STREET -- DUSK

The entire company, along with most of the matrons, walks a-
long in high spirits.

INT. BERLIN, PARIS BAR -- DUSK
The company is given the back tables at a busy cafe.

Susie sits at one end with Sonia, Marketa, and Doll. The
matrons gather at the other. Blanc is there, as are Tanner,
Mandel, and Millius. Vendegast sits beside Danielle, who’s
high laugh has already begun. Miss Huller and Pavla are not
present.

MISS TANNER
Girls! Remember the limit! Nine
marks. Other than that, choose as
you like. You’ve earned it.

Susie has not been absorbed into any cliques since Sara’s de-
parture. She’s with the group, but not of it anymore.

Susie seems to understand tonight is meant to be the night
for whatever is going to be asked of her. She seems hypervig-
ilent, but not afraid. The matrons certainly understand it.
They are already celebrating the end to their long season of
worry. Only Blanc looks disconsolate.

CUT TO:
EXT. EAST BERLIN, FRIEDRICHSTRABE -- DUSK
Klemperer has come into East Germany tonight. But when he
gets to the fountain where he usually sits, a WOMAN (60s) is
sitting there. As he walks toward her, he recognizes more and
more of her posture, the set of her head. He walks faster to
her, When he is almost behind her, she turns.

It is the woman from the photo in his sitting room, aged thir-
ty years. Love fills her face.

“NKE"
Jozef.

CUT TO:
INT. PARIS BAR, BERLIN -- NIGHT

The girls eat and drink everything in front of them. The mat-—
rons have ordered food, but none of them touch it.
85.

Susie notices this, but no one else seems to. She puts her
fork down and abstains as well.

CUT TO:
EXT. WEST BERLIN -- NIGHT

Klemperer and “Anke” walk together through the city, back
into West Berlin. When they get to the checkpoint, they walk
through it unaccosted. None of the guards seem to notice.

“NKE"
<< Karol had told them about me. He
betrayed us. I had minutes to get
out. I couldn’t find you. I travel-
ed on foot to try for Teplice where
I planned to ask Mirek’s family to
take me in, but I was caught at the
border and taken to Terezin. >>

Klemperer tries to interject the first of what must be a mil-
lion regrets and apologies, but she stops him--she wants to
tell him everything first. She caresses his face and he grabs
her hand as if it were a bird about to fly away.

“BNKE” (CONT'D)
<< After the liberation I made my
way to Zurich, and then to Milan.
I've had a life there. A lovely
life. I was told you had died in
the invasion. >>

Klemperer just shakes his head and lets his eyes go cloudy
with tears.

They come up the FriedrichstraBe, but when Klemperer tries to
lead her in the direction of his apartment, she takes his arm
and turns him down Kochstrage, in another direction.

CUT TO:
INT. BERLIN, PARIS BAR -- NIGHT

The girls are quite drunk now. Susie notices Blanc looking at
her and the other matrons looking at the girls with growing
excitement. Tanner is making her way around the table, touch-
ing each girl as she goes, rendering each one a little thick-
er in affect, hazier in look, beginning a process of mesmeri-
zation. She does not touch Susie.
86.

The BREATHING in Susie’s head is growing louder, but she
seems no longer even intimidated by it. It’s simply the sound
of something coming now, possibly something great.

SUSIE (V.O.)
I‘’1l go walk in the streets.

Blanc is looking at her, as if she might cry. After a beat,
her thoughts responds. Susie can hear them now.

BLANC (V.O.)
If you’re sure.

(beat)
Give us time. There is much to be

done.

Susie gets up to go. The other matrons watch her with genuine
warmth now.

CUT TO:
EXT. MARKOS COMPANY -- NIGHT

As they walk, Klemperer is both aware and unaware they are
walking toward the Markos Company. He is now a man thoroughly
distracted by his most cherished dream. It begins to snow.

They arrive at the company building, all dark now except for

a light on at the entrance. “Anke” stops and embraces him.
Before he can protest, the company’s front door opens behind
them. Women come out. And, like a man slipping under dark wat-
er, he feels himself being taken in.

“Anke” becomes recognizable as Miss Huller, who is now laugh-
ing.

CUT TO:
EXT. THE STREETS OF BERLIN -- NIGHT

Susie begins to walk, taking in the early stirring of Berlin
night life. As she walks, the BREATHING is with her, but some-
thing odd begins happening as well. Her awareness begins to
focus on little moments of sadness or aggression.

She can hear a couple arguing quietly a block away.

BERLINER #1
<< It was wrong to take your
father’s money. He pays rent, too,
and without an income. >>
87.

In a passing car, a child spills a soda on the leather seat.
Then she sees the boy’s father angrily shove the can into his
son's face when he discovers it twenty minutes from now.

She sees a man photographing damage done to his suit shop
with a Brownie camera, then the stormtroopers kicking the win-
dow in.

She's going forward and backward in time and tasting all the
flavors of the continuing patriarchy.

She sees the Berlin Wall being put up, being torn down. She
can see a skinhead almost tenderly polishing his his 10-hole
boots, then later wiping blood off them. Groups of Muslim men
in keffiyehs take flags of Jordan out of plastic sleeves, the
price tags still on them, even as someone burns them. She ob-
serves a lit window in which a young woman is arrested by SS,
then the same woman, elderly now, calls in a prescription re-
fill, introducing herself as a Patient Number.

ELDERLY WOMAN
<< Three four oh oh two. Seven one
one nine. >>

Susie is not afraid of what she’s seeing, or of where it
belongs in history. Once she adjusts to it, she walks flushed
and amazed through these mirages as if through a great muse-
um, humbled by her proximity to things that so delight her.
The SIGHING in her head plays as its accompaniment.

INT. MUTTERHAUS, FIRST ROOM -- NIGHT

As Dr. Klemperer is lead into the Mutterhaus, he sees Miss
Huller replacing the silver body hook on its shelf, somehow
retrieved from the Spree. It is covered with river mud.

MISS HULLER
<< How dirty he made it! >>

They lead him over the threshhold and onto the first of the
stairs.

KLEMPERER
<< Pity! --Have pity! >>

MISS HULLER
<< What reason is there to pity
you? You had five years to get your
wife out of Berlin before arrests
began. >>

They proceed to lead him up the stairs and then disappear
over the arc of the passageway.
88.

MISS HULLER (0.S.) (CONT'D)
<< When women tell you the truth,
you don’t pity them. You tell them
they are delusional! >>

The witches laugh at Klemperer now, even as he begs them.

CUT TO:
INT. BERLIN, ICE CREAM PARLOUR -- NIGHT
Susie has gone into a shop and eats an ice cream sundae in
the front window, like a child might, watching the parade of
history pass by outside.

CUT TO:
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, ENTRANCE HALL/STAIRS -- NIGHT
Susie comes in from the snowy night to find the building emp-
ty and silent. She can occasionally hear a BURST OF LAUGHTER
from far, far away. She climbs the stairs, the dust of clean
snow melting on the shoulders of her coat.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, RESIDENCE CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
She can now definitely hear there is a GREAT PARTY going on
somewhere behind the walls. No one else is on the floor, but
this doesn’t surprise Susie.
INT. MARKOS COMPANY, SUSIE’S ROOM -- NIGHT
Susie comes into her room to find, laid out on her bed, a
long, simple shift dress. As she is putting it on, the light
wavers outside her door and she can see the small font of
white flame there, waiting.
INT. MUTTERHAUS, STAIRS/APPROACH/TUBE/ROOM OF HOLES -- NIGHT
Susie finds her way into the Mutterhaus, led by the font. She
climbs the secret stairs and finds the approach. She comes in-
to the tube room, then through the room of holes.

Beyond it, there are more stairs. All the light and noise is
coming from below now. She will see it in a moment.

INT. MUTTERHAUS, ROOM OF FEASTS -- NIGHT

Susie comes down a set of stairs that lead to another. The
first is part of the building, but the second--

Blanc and a bent woman, misshapen with disease and supported
by matrons, wait near the top of this final staircase.
89.

From here there is a view of all below. Susie sees a great
room in which a hideous, raucous tableau is taking place.

All the matrons are seated around the huge triangular table.
The table is now set with all nature of arcane dishes and
crockery. They are feasting. The feasting room has three high
stone arches leading to a vast and separate darkness in each
direction.

Susie notices Klemperer, stripped naked now, has been put in
the center space inside the triangle the table forms. The
matrons taunt him, summoning him from one to the next where
he is made to eat victuals off of their plates--some of which
look like stool, some like organs, perhaps from animals, per-
haps not. He is muttering:

KLEMPERER
<< I am not guilty! I remember! I
am an innocent! >>

His jowls are stained. He is forced to take wine from the ma-
trons’ own laughing mouths.

Susie next notices three girls are serving the matrons. All
have masks depicting the faces of the The Mothers. Mother of
Tears, Mother of Shadows, and Mother of Sighs. Susie can see
from the tone of their flesh they are dead. One of the girls,
the one masked as Mother Suspiriorum, has noticed her also.
She stands looking up at Susie until she is called back into
service.

 

The dead girls serve the matrons who, in turn, needle into
the girls’ open palms with special tines so the girls’ dead
blood sauces their plates.

Some of the matrons have noticed Susie at the top of the
stairs as well. They raise they cups in her direction, with
toasts and great, heaving smiles.

BLANC (0.S.)
Susie. Don’t you know who this is?

Susie looks. The bent old woman beside Blanc is looking at
her, studying her.

This is HELENA MARKOS (???). She is hard to look at, so
weighed down and disfigured by tumors is she. Some lay flat,
others are raised up on stalks like warts. She is covered by
them, made pregnant by them. She is a horrific vision of age
on a human form--not the normal way age treats the body, but
the product of time being turned back again and again until
the skin and tissue cannot hold so many contradictions. She
looks angry to be so tired.
90.

Susie nods. She performs the slightest bow.

SUSIE
I’m ready, Madame.

Blanc nods, but doesn’t respond. Susie says to her directly:

SUSIE (CONT'D)
You look afraid.

Markos laughs. It is the sound of amused air climbing past
whatever tumors lie within.

MARKOS
She's afraid for you, dear.
(beat)
Do you know what we have planned
for you? There’ll be nothing of you
left inside. Only space. For me.

SUSIE
I came here for this. I know that
now.

Susie holds out her hand. Blanc takes it.

SUSIE (CONT'D)
I want what’s coming.

(beat)
You've all waited long enough.

Markos gives her an almost lascivious look. Susie listens to
MARKOS’ LABORED BREATHING. This is not the breathing she’s
had in her head all this time. This speaks only of illness,
not of the entire language Susie has been hearing within the
sighs.

Then Markos slowly raises a hand. Within seconds, the women
below all see the gesture and quiet.

MARKOS
LET IT BEGIN! IN THE NAME OF THE
MOTHERS. LET IT BEGIN!

Susie watches as the plates are removed with ritualistic pre-
cision. The tables are dismantled and taken to the sides lea-
ving an empty space in the center of the room.

A GREAT MUSIC begins. Klemperer is taken to the base of the
staircase to witness what is about to happen. The three dead
girls hold the three golden leashes fixed around his neck.

Susie sees the rest of the girls from the company step into
the space, entranced somehow, and blindfolded.
gl.

They begin the choreography of OPEN AGAIN. They don’t seem to
know where they are, they just dance. The matrons down on the
floor dance among them. All the women are nude. Every shape
and state of the female body is on display.

A LOW DRONE begins out of the air, taking its vibrations from
the spell of the dance. The girls begin dancing backward now,
like a tide going out. Then forward again, coaxing something
to come forward from the infinite spaces beyond the room.

HELENA MARKOS
They are summoning what we need.

SUSIE
Death.

HELENA MARKOS
What do you think is happening,
girl?

SUSIE
A ritual. To renew you.

HELENA MARKOS
“Renew” is a beautiful word. Do you
come to this willingly?

SUSIE
I do.

BLANC
You must have no doubts, Susie. If
you do, I will take you back. Take
all of this out of your head. You
can forget everything.

Markos laughs, smugly.

HELENA MARKOS
Except your jumps. And your kicks
and leaps and rolls--

BLANC
I would like this to be pure.

HELENA MARKOS
We know what you would like.
(aggressive)
This is not vanity! Who knows how
much longer we must march forward?

SUSIE
I can be both.
92.

Blanc looks at Susie, then at Markos.

BLANC
You see? She doesn’t understand!

Blanc steps forward, but Markos holds her with a look.

SUSIE
I do.

HELENA MARKOS
She understands enough. On the
floor, girl.

In the vastness beyond the arch opposite the stairs, where
light and darkness meet, something is assembling itself. It
can be felt before it can be seen. Some of the matrons are
sensing it. Blanc is sensing it.

Two matrons, Misses Millius and Huller, step forward to help
Susie out of her clothes. Susie is shown to the floor where
she kneels and lays of the cold stone. The matrons take her
arms to the sides. Susie turns her face down. Markos slowly
stands.

BLANC
Something’s wrong. You don’t feel
it--?

Under the arch, a wet blackness is assembling into being.

BLANC (CONT'D)
Markos, this isn’t right. Let her
up--!

But with a gesture, Markos makes a dash with her hand out at
Blanc and Blanc’s neck is chopped from behind. Blanc crumples
to her knees and slumps back against the wall. The chop has
severed her spine, but not her trachea. Her head slides fo-
rward until it is stopped by her chest. Then it sits there,
face cast downward.

Susie hears this take place, but does not dare look. Markos
turns her attention back to Susie.

HELENA MARKOS
We have been on two sides of this
too long. You want this, girl?

SUSIE
Yes.
93.

HELENA MARKOS
If you accept me, and accept what
we seek, you must put down the wo-
man who bore you to the world.

Susie closes her eyes. She concentrates on the BREATHING, the
SIGHS in her head, pulling it into her own rhythm.

HELENA MARKOS (CONT’D)
Think of that false mother now,
lying in her reek of pain. Release
her from you. You have the Mothers
you need now. Death to any other
mother.

SUSIE
I am the Mother.

Markos looks down at her, not sure she’s heard correctly.

The dancing and singing is frantic, but the witches are not
prepared for what happens next. Something black and dripping
with the energy of its passage into the world rides out of
the space beneath the arch and is suddenly in the room with
them.

Some of the matrons SCREAM and move back from it. It’s clear
nothing like this has been seen before in these rooms. Others
are steadfast and continue dancing, terrified, some within
feet of it. The mesmerized, blindfolded girls remain in the
dance unaware.

Markos herself is looking at the black thing in confused awe.
She glances over at Blanc, concerned now that Blanc is behind
this, or understands it. But it is Susie who looks up at
Markos.

SUSIE (CONT'D)
You've played at this long enough.

Markos opens her mouth in shock. She hisses:

HELENA MARKOS
Who are you?

SUSIE
Whom were you anointed for? Which
of the Three?

HELENA MARKOS
Mother Suspiriorum, girl.

Susie says, simply, finally coming into her full identity.
94.

SUSIE
I am she.

At the bottom of the stairs, the girl dressed as Mother Su-
spiriorum hears this and takes off her mask. It is Sara. She
looks up at Susie, and holds out the mask. Reverently.

SARA
The Mother! The Mother!

Others who have supported Markos from the start begin to cry,
or WAIL OUT. What is happening is akin to Jesus Christ him-
self walking into a modern Easter service. No one is prepar-
ed for one of the Three Mothers being among them.

Markos looks down at Susie, the first twitch of astonishment
entering her withered face.

SUSIE
Death to any other Mother.

The black form hears this and spares no glance around, but
carries itself up the stairs, past a terrified Klemperer, to-
ward Markos, low to the ground like Susie’s improvisations,
fast as the shadow of an eclipse crossing the land.

As it climbs, two things happen simultaneously:
INT. OHIO FARMHOUSE, ADULTS’ BEDROOM -- DAY

Mrs. Bannion lies, dazed and pale, in her sick bed. Several
neighbor women have collected there and are quietly singing a
HYMN. Mrs. Bannion fades in and out, in a dream or memory:

A young Susie (10) is in home school class. She is meant to
be memorizing a map of the United States, but keeps turning
her workbook back to another page. The girl wants to look at
the shapes of Europe instead. Mrs. Bannion, who is teaching
her, snaps the page back, impatiently, as if for the tenth
time. She hisses:

MRS. BANNION
Susannah.

Ten-year-old Susie looks up at her, unintimidated, even toler-
ant for now.

But Mrs. Bannion is lifted from this memory as something en-
ters the room with her. She has a fraction of a second to see
the shadow’s face before it overtakes her.

Naomi, who has been sitting with the neighbor women, mending,
looks up now into the dead face of her mother.
95.

INT. MUTTERHAUS, ROOM OF FEASTS -- NIGHT

Death reaches Markos, rears up, and tears through the woman’s
meager magical defenses, then through her flesh. Susie gets
slowly to her feet to watch.

When it is finished, it goes loping back down the stairs to
every Markosite in the room. They see it coming and SCREAM--
Miss Mandel and Millius, Miss Balfour, Miss Huller, Miss
Marks, Pavla, Miss Verdigast, and Alberta. The black thing
cuts them down in its killing ebb, leaving the Blancites un-
touched. Then is uncoils into the void beyond.

Tanner is spared. She’s weeping, weeping. The remaining
witches find their voices and begin to scream praises. They
thought they were about to witness the rebirth of their
leader Helena Markos, and instead they have seen the arrival
of one of the very Mothers they have only read about for cen-
turies.

MATRONS IN THE ROOM
MUTTER! MUTTER! MUTTER SUSPIRIORUM!

As Susie walks down the stairs, the font of light burns over
her head, scattering all shadow, all ambiguity. Up close to
it, as Susie is, one can hear the sound of TEN THOUSAND FOR-
ESTS BURNING in it.

She reaches up and pulls her throat open along a vertical to
form a new mouth to speak out of.

When she reaches the bottom, where Sara stands, she takes the
mask from her and puts it aside. Then she takes off Olga’s,
and then Patricia’s, who have come forward, and sets them a-
side.

She leads them into a dance, telling them as they go:

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM
I am here now! I am with you!

Their eyes are rimmed with white. They dance for a time until
Susie recognizes they are sad in their state.

PATRICIA
Mother, we are so tired.

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM
What do you ask?

PATRICIA
To die! To die!
96.

She places a hand briefly on Olga’s ruined face, then Patri-
cia's, and lets them die mortal deaths.

She and Sara dance for a time until Sara says to her:

SARA
Mother, please.

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM
What do you ask?

SARA
To die!

And Susie puts her hand briefly on Sara’s face, like a lover
would, and then over it until she falls away, as if froma
great height, from the mortal world into death.

Susie dances in solo then, charging the air, the room, the
coven with her power. Finally, she calls out to the other
witches:

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM
It is beautiful! Beautiful! Contin-
ue the dance!

The dancers wind back up again, but with a force that gives

the impression Susie is controlling them now. She enters the
dance, leads it, leads it into the air, with no underfoot or
overhead, just circles and circles of power.

Klemperer is watching all of this unfold, his mind at the
edge of ruin.

FADE TO BLACK:
EXT. BERLIN, STREETS -- DAWN
Susie is walking down the center of the street through the
snow. It SQUEALS under her boots. Lights are burning in some
windows, but not many people are out yet. She walks with a
gait and confidence that is itself nearly a dance. This is
her city now, its people her people.

CUT TO:

INT. MUTTERHAUS, ROOM OF FEASTS -- DAY
The remaining matrons are beginning the long process of

cleaning the Room of Feasts. They remove the stained linens
from the table. They scrub the stones.
97.

INT. MARKOS COMPANY, HALLWAYS/STUDIOS -- DAY

The dancers are all in the studios rehearsing, oblivious. The
company is running again as usual. Miss Boutaher leads the re-
hearsal. Danielle beats the drum. There’s no hint of strange-
ness in the girls. They remember nothing, it’s clear.

BACK TO:
INT. KLEMPERER’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -—- DAY

Klemperer is alive, though unwell. He has survived his night
with the coven, but has been shaken past what he can tolerate
psychologically.

Madame Sesame brings him tea, a slice of brown bread with a
little butter crock, a sliced up pear. She puts it on his bed-
side table. The room is dim, the curtains nearly shut against
the snowy morning. He doesn’t want the light.

After a few moments, the door opens and Susie comes in with-
out knocking. Frau Sesame turns in surprise.

FRAU SESAME
<< Good morning. No one taught you
to knock on a closed door? >>

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM
<< Wait on the stairs. >>

The housekeeper, coming into her fright, goes.

Susie enters. Klemperer’s eyes follow her into the room and
to a chair beside the bed. He is shaking. The light from the
window is behind her now, casting her nearly in silhouette.

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM (CONT’D)

I’ve been thinking about you. I
wasn’t yet in a position to prevent
what my daughters did to you, but I
regret it. Truly. I want to make it
up if I can. I brought a gift.

(beat)
You deserve to know what happened.

KLEMPERER
Please.

But Susie closes her eyes, summoning a path through history
to his wife. Her silhouette begins to change as she exerts

herself. He can see the outline of Mother Suspiriorum--the

halo of darkness.
98.

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM
Your wife tried to make it south to
Teplice. But she was apprehended by
border guards in the woods outside
Glashiitte and taken, finally, to Te-
rezin instead. Theresienstadt camp.

Klemperer’s eyes are already tearing up with this confirma-
tion of his worst nightmare. He clamps them shut. When he
opens them, he is looking at the bedside table beside them,
where the cut up pear sits in a dish with the knife. It is
not a big knife, but it is sharp. And it’s within reach.

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM (CONT’D)

She lived there only twenty days.

On the 11th of November, 1943, the
Commandant of the camp, a man named

Burger, ordered all 40,000 detained

there to stand in the cold for a

census. Hours passed. Most were nak-

ed. Some hundreds died of exposure.

CLOSE ON: Under the lids, Susie’s eyes move here and there as
if she is seeing what she’s describing.

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM (CONT’D)
Your wife had two women with her as
she died, who told her she was not
alone: An elderly secretary from
Denmark and a woman from Moravia,
whom your wife had befriended. Her
final moments were spent thinking
of a birthday in which you sur-
prised her by taking her to hear a
concert. Chopin and Brahms. It was
the first time you held her hand.
She was not afraid. Her thoughts
were of you. Only of you.

Susie reaches the end and opens her eyes, back in her mortal
form.

She sees: Klemperer is crying through all of this, rocking
with silent, hopeless sobs. Hope, even hope scraped thin, was
preferable to him than this. She savors his pain.

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM (CONT’D)
Be calm, doctor. That’s not the
gift.

Susie leans in and takes his hand.
99.

SUSIE/MOTHER SUSPIRIORUM (CONT’D)
Of Anke-- Of Patricia-- Of Sara--
Of me-- Of all the women of your un-
doing-- When I touch your face, ev-
ery memory of them will go. They’1ll
melt in the sun and be gone.

She doesn’t ask him if he’s ready. She touches the place just
in front of his ear. Then she gets up to leave him to the
attendant seizure.

Before she goes, though, she reaches into the bedclothes and
finds the knife he’s taken from the bedside table and re-
turns it so he doesn’t accidentally cut himself.

He bucks and spasms in his bed. Once Susie is gone, Frau Ses-—
ame rushes to his bedside.

FRAU SESAME
Doctor! --Doctor!

But he finally comes out of the convulsions. His eyes find
her and he looks at her, confused, as if trying to place her.

CUT TO:
INT. MUTTERHAUS, ROOM OF FEASTS -- DAWN
Matrons come up the stairs to the bodies there. One of the
matrons stoops down to begin to solve the problem of Madame

Blanc. She is astonished to find:

Blanc is still alive. Her eyes look up from her half-severed
head. She tries to speak. She blinks at the gathering women.

We follow Miss Huller as she sprints up the stairs to summon
help.

CUT TO:
INT. BKA HEADQUARTERS, WAITING ROOM -- DAY
In the lobby is the row of “TERRORISTEN” posters Klemperer
saw, with their dozens and dozens of photos of men and women,
some with names others with question marks. Many are crossed
out. Patricia’s looks smudged somehow, now totally unrecogni-
zable.

CUT TO:
EXT. EAST BERLIN, FRIEDRICHSTRABE -- DAY

Later in the morning, the streets are filling with people
walking to work. Klemperer is no where to be seen.
100.

We END on the image of the ruined fountain where Klemperer
used to stop and linger with his wife’s memory. It is empty
now, and will be from now on.

A wife, a life, an entire war, have been forgotten.

END.
