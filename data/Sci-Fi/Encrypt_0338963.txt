ENCRYPT
by Richard Taylor

FADE IN:

THE EARTH

spins in mortal turmoil. A vast spinner of clouds the size of
Australia approaches the west coast of North America,
lightning flashing, thunder BELLOWING and CRACKLING. The sky
glows red and purple, angry and crazy. This is the planet
made Gothic by human intervention.

SEATTLE - THE SPACE NEEDLE

is buffeted by hundred-and-fifty-mile-an-hour winds. Plate
glass shatters and explodes.

SAN FRANCISCO - THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE

quakes before the raging wind. A giant tsunami surges toward
the great suspension bridge. When it passes, cables have been
wrenched, untwining, and collapse appears imminent.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The city is a swamp, some buildings on dry ground, others
below sea level. Far south and east of its northern cousins,
the full thrust of the storm has not struck Los Angeles yet.
Smoke from open fires trail skyward like ghosts and spread
along the ceiling of the sky even as it bleeds rain
everywhere.

A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL (MANDY)

runs, terrified, down a decayed city street. She clutches
something in her dirt-caked hands, holds it dear to her

breast.

The girl slides around a corner on her bottom, stares back.

GIRL'S POV - THE STREET

seems derelict. A flash of lightning reveals men scurrying
like rats after her.

RESUME AND FOLLOW MANDY (A MONTAGE)

as she turns and scrambles away. Her pursuers follow her
everywhere — around rusting cars, through an abandoned MTA
bus, and across the rubble of a building that once dispensed
happy meals and toys.

Mandy dives into a burrow beneath piled debris.

One of the men walks directly toward her.

Another scurries, chortling madly, around to her side.

A third man approaches from behind.

Mandy clutches her prize ever-more tightly and prays that
they don't see her.

They do.

The leader lifts Mandy from the debris, her naked legs
dangling from beneath her torn dress.

LEAD RAT
Lookit what I got!

Mandy struggles and screams. Lead Rat covers her mouth.

Limping Rat snatches the prize from her fingers: A dinner
roll, hard as a rock and twice as filthy.

LIMPING RAT
So that's what you're hiding, little
girl? Don't you want to share? You want
to share, right?
Mandy writhes free enough to say:

MANDY
Take it! Take it! Just... leave me alone!

Chortling Rat arrives. His fingers pinch Mandy's leg.

CHORTLING RAT
This little girl's plump.

Lead Rat drops her to the ground, assesses her.
LEAD RAT

You got family, girl... with anything to
trade?

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 3.
CONTINUED:

Mandy understands immediately.

MANDY
Yes! Yes, my daddy's got canned goods.
And gasoline.

Lead Rat thinks about this. The dinner roll lying abandoned
nearby suggests not.

CHORTLING RAT
She'd feed us for a week!

LIMPING RAT
(grinning, of Chortling Rat as

he assesses girl)
I dunno... You still on that diet?

Mandy screams and tries to break away. Lead Rat holds her in
a vise grip.

Chortling Rat kneels beside the little girl.

CHORTLING RAT
(of leader)
I never took you for squeamish.

That settles it. Lead Rat produces a huge switchblade. It
snaps out, steel catching the light.

Mandy screams.

An arrow slams through Lead Rat's neck. He doesn't move, not
believing.

JOHN GARTH (35) STANDS ON A WALL (SCENE),

a hard man with hawk eyes now focused on killing. Even though
he is a warrior, there is something humane about John Garth.
He knows there is no glory to what he is doing. His rock-like
exposed arms hold the bow's tension like the cables of a
suspension bridge, and shake with the load. He releases.

Lead Rat faces death and drops.

Limping Rat is already scurrying away, weapon drawn, when
Garth's second arrow catches him. He drops.

Chortling Rat, whining fearfully, scuttles around debris,
hiding his silhouette. He pulls a nasty looking automatic and
looks up to find a target when an arrow slams into him. He
falls.

(CONTINUED )

CONTINUED:

Garth drops to the ground, walks to Mandy, who stands sucking
air like the price is going up.

JOHN GARTH
Your mother's worried.

Mandy shakes her head crazily. Yes, I know.

Garth kneels beside her. Mandy bursts into his arms. He holds
her like a father until her sobs diminish.

GARTH
You shouldn't go out by yourself.

Mandy buries her head in his chest, safe now.

MANDY
But I'm hungry, John.

GARTH
I know...

Garth releases her and steps past to harvest the arrow that
took Lead Rat's life. He takes the switchblade as well.

Mandy scurries to where the dinner roll lies and retrieves
it. She tries to bite into it. Hard as stone.
BESIDE LIMPING RAT'S CORPSE - GARTH

harvests the second arrow, using the switchblade to cut the
arrow out.

Mandy staggers to Garth's side. She looks yearningly at
Limping Rat. Clutching Garth's leg:

MANDY
It would be a waste to just leave them
here.
GARTH
(understanding her meaning)
No.
MANDY
But I'm hungry.
GARTH
You stay here. I have to get my other

arrow.

Garth moves to get the arrow.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 5.
CONTINUED:

Mandy waits nervously near Limping Rat's corpse. When Garth
returns, he scoops her up and starts walking away.

Looking back from Garth's arms, Mandy's hungry eyes remain on
the corpse.

EXT. SURVIVOR'S CAMP - NIGHT

It's a hovel bandaged with debris. Campfires burn with
constant complaint, sizzling embers and hissing wood once
shaped by hand. Mist clouds everything.

Men and women guard the ramparts, some with guns, some with
bows like Garth's.

A GUARD
Someone's coming.

The men scramble to the walls.

GARTH'S VOICE
(a shout)
John Garth!

A moment later Garth enters the camp with Mandy carried on
his hip.

Mandy's mother rushes to take her into her arms as Garth
drops her.

MANDY'S MOM
Mandy!

MANDY
Look, Mom... I found some bread.

MANDY'S MOM
Where were you?! I've been worried to
death!

GARTH
She's okay. I found her about six blocks
south, near Pico.

MANDY'S MOM
Thank you.

GARTH
It's okay.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 6.
CONTINUED:

MANDY
(showing her prize)
Mom! Look, bread!

MANDY'S MOM
You put that away, now. One of the
hunters found meat. We have stew.
Garth turns at this information. Meat?

MANDY
Food?! Mommy, I'm so hungry...

MANDY'S MOM
Come on, sweetheart. I'll get you a bowl.

Garth questions this silently, then turns to head for his
digs.

EXT./INT. GARTH'S DIGS - NIGHT

An often-repaired tent. Garth throws the entry flap back,
enters to find his father, MATTHEW, Garth grown older and

weaker. He lies in a hammock, recovering from a broken leg.

MATTHEW
You're not dead, I see.

Storing his equipment:

GARTH
Not yet. How's the leg?
MATTHEW
I'm hobbling about. Anything happen out

there?

Garth turns to survey his father, pulls three cans of
Campbell's soup from his jacket.

GARTH
I killed six men... three this morning
over these...
(presents the cans)
... three tonight over the Parker girl.

MATTHEW
You found her alive?

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 7.

CONTINUED:
GARTH
Alive. She wouldn't have stayed that way
long... I hear they've got stew. Did

anybody bring you some?

Matthew snorts.

MATTHEW
Rodriguez says he killed a deer. Brought
the meat in already butchered... There

are no deer left in Los Angeles, not even
in the canyons.

Garth understands. Meat. Of the human variety. After a
moment:

GARTH
How 'bout some Campbell's soup? M'M-M'M-
Good...
(reads labels)
Cream of mushroom... chicken noodle...
and cream of tomato.

MATTHEW
(smacking his lips)
Chicken noodle. I'll stoke the fire.
GARTH
No, dad. I'll take care of it. You stay
off that leg.

Garth pulls his survival knife and begins to open one of the
cans.

DISSOLVE:

INT. GARTH'S DIGS - NIGHT

Garth and Matthew lie asleep after their repast, Matthew in
his hammock, Garth on a bed made of old clothes.

EXT. SURVIVOR'S CAMP - NIGHT

Guards walk lonely beats behind walls of debris.

Suddenly a brilliant light appears in the night sky. A VOICE
from a loudspeaker:

HELICOPTER VOICE
You people in the camp... We're looking
for John Garth.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 8.

ANOTHER ANGLE - HELICOPTER

hovers a hundred yards from the ramparts, its single
directional light bouncing from point to point on the walls.

HELICOPTER VOICE
Is he in there?

EXT. CAMP
Garth exits his digs. His father hobbles after.
A camp citizen climbs to the top of the walls.

CAMP CITIZEN
He's here... What do you want?

HELICOPTER VOICE
We're coming in.

The chopper sets down.

MOMENTS LATER - THREE MEN

enter the camp. Two wear LAPD uniforms, the third a long coat
with a detective badge pinned to a lapel, LAPIERE. He's the
sort of man who becomes a cop because of one perk — power.
One of the uniforms carries a cardboard box marked Peaches.

The camp citizens give them a wide berth. Garth stands one
row back.

LAPIERE
I'm Detective Lieutenant Oscar LaPiere of
the LAPD.

THE CROWD
--. he's no cop... no police anymore...
he's lying (etc.)

LAPIERE
Of course there are police left.
(smiling confidently)
We're just like you, trying to survive.
We help when we can.

GARTH
You must be pretty busy... elsewhere.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 9.
CONTINUED:

Lapiere's steady grin belies the heat of his eyes directed at
Garth.

LAPIERE
Where's John Garth?
GARTH
What do you want with him?
LAPIERE
I've brought him a gift. Are you John
Garth?
GARTH

What gift? Who sent it?

LaPiere allows the question to dangle a moment, then steps
aside and gestures to the cop holding the crate to set it
down.

LAPIERE
Peaches... Name brand, not the store
variety... packed in syrup.

The gasp of camp citizens suggests this might be gold.

GARTH
Who sent it?

LAPIERE
Anton Reich.

Garth kneels beside the cardboard box to check the glue
seals. Not tampered with.

LAPIERE (CONT'D)
I take it you're John Garth?

GARTH
Who's Anton Reich? And what does he want
with me?

Mandy steps through the crowd and kneels beside the box. She
is in awe of it.

LAPIERE
He wants to hire you. He instructed me to
tell you — this is a signing bonus.

GARTH
Signing bonus? Then it's not a gift?

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 10.
CONTINUED:

LAPIERE
Oh no. It's yours. No strings.

Garth considers that, then tears the box open and hands Mandy
a can. She can't suppress her joy. Running to her mother:

MANDY
Mommy! Mommy! Look what I got!
LAPIERE
(continuing with restrained
disapproval)
You can do with it what you will, of
course... Mr. Reich just wants to take a

meeting with you.

Garth removes four cans from the box and gives them to his
father. Taking one can for himself, Garth shoves what remains
of the box into the arms of the camp leader.

GARTH
Share this...
(to LaPiere)
Let's go.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAMP - NIGHT
The helicopter looks shiny new as Garth, LaPiere and the cops

trudge through debris-ridden terrain. Garth uses his survival
knife to open the can of peaches.

GARTH
(of chopper)
I didn't think there were any of those
left.
LAPIERE
You'd be surprised what's left... if you

know the right people.

EXT./INT. THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The chopper flies through the rainy night.

Garth pushes the can lid back and drinks thirstily before
lifting a peach slice out and swallowing it whole, like a
bear with a fish just caught from a stream. LaPiere looks on
with amusement. Garth sees his look, offers the can.

LAPIERE
No thank you. I've eaten.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 11.
CONTINUED:

Garth shrugs, digs out another fish.

EXT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER LANDING PAD - NIGHT

The lights work, even if the sign has been damaged: UCL(A)
M(ed) ICAL CEN(t)ER. The chopper sets down.

Garth, Lapiere and the attending cops exit and make for the
big hospital building as Garth tosses the empty can of
peaches into an empty wire receptacle.

INT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT

Garth, LaPiere and the uniformed cops make their way into the
building, which obviously is no longer in use as a hospital.
Even though it appears abandoned, the lights work.

Garth stops to look around. He hasn't seen electric lights in
months.

GARTH
What's powering these lights?

LAPIERE
(moving him along)
Mr. Reich has his residence on the top
floor.

INT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER TOP FLOOR - NIGHT

An immense open bay. At one end are stacked platform after
platform of canned goods, ammunition, oil, military weaponry
in cases, liquor, medical supplies. At the opposite end, a
mansion in miniature with unblemished furniture, Persian
carpets, drapes over the windows, stands of famous artworks,
paintings, sculpture, and a huge oak desk stolen, certainly,
from a rich man's office.

Men in uniform stand guard beside the elevator door, one
LAPD, the second MTA. One uniform is as good as another,
apparently

The elevator opens. Garth and LaPiere exit, followed by the
two cops.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ANTON REICH

is a man of formidable countenance. 50, he wears clothes that
in better times might be considered obscenely expensive. He

is a leader, a manipulator, and a salesman. He approaches
Garth as if welcoming an important client, extending a hand.

REICH
Major Garth, welcome. Anton Reich.

Garth surveys him briefly, the proffered hand, then turns his
gaze to the cops.

REICH (CONT'D)
Don't worry. They're not really police.
They work for me now.

Garth's gaze continues to the flats of canned goods and other
supplies.

REICH (CONT'D)
Are you hungry, Major?

GARTH
Oh no, I just finished dinner. Steak and
lobster, a good chardonnay, and chocolate
mousse for dessert.

REICH
(amused)
Better than my table, I'm afraid. But I
can have my cook whip up something...

Major?
GARTH
I'm not a major.
REICH
No, of course not. Not anymore. Who of us
have titles these days?... Sergeant?
LAPIERE

It's Lieutenant, Mr. Reich.

REICH
Mr. Garth and I will have dinner in the
residence. See to it.

LAPIERE
Yes, sir.

Lapiere turns and moves for the elevator.
REICH
(to cops)
You two may leave as well.

The two cops follow LaPiere.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 13.
CONTINUED:

Reich takes Garth by the arm, and releases him on Garth's
look.

REICH (CONT'D)
While we're waiting for dinner, can I get
you anything else?

GARTH
Well, Adolph... you can tell me what you
want so I can blow this bunker.

REICH
Adolph... not such a bad fellow after
all, now was he?... I should think simple

logic would answer your question. You
have nothing I could want — except skill.
Obviously, I want to hire you.

GARTH
I'm not for hire.

REICH
Yes, I'm certain that's so. Do you see
that flat of canned goods back there?

Garth looks. A mountain eight feet by eight feet. A fortune.

REICH (CONT'D)
I had it brought up here just so you
could see it. I usually leave food down
in the pantry... In any case, there are
sixty cases of beef stew, sixty of fruit
cocktail, sixty cases of peaches — my
favorite, I usually have peaches for
dessert — sixty cases of deviled ham,
sixty cases of hash, sixty cases of tuna,
sixty cases of... well, I can give you a
manifest.

Garth takes in the vast fortune. He fails to hide his
astonishment.

REICH (CONT'D)
Are you still not for hire, Major Garth?

Garth's silence is answer enough.

REICH (CONT'D)
I thought so...

GARTH
Who do you want me to kill?

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 14.
CONTINUED:

REICH
Kill? Kill?! Killing is easy, Major. What
I want you to do is much harder. Care for
a brandy?

Reich opens a fresh bottle of Courvoisier, almost fills two
snifters, turns to hand one to Garth.

GARTH

stands before one of a dozen paintings, many recognizable,
but not this. It's a map of the earth with a vast storm, not
unlike the Red Spot of Jupiter, swirling across the world.

Reich presents Garth with a brandy.

REICH
You've found my Nilsson. It's
magnificent, isn't it?

Garth takes the brandy, sniffs, and is snatched into
enthralled memories.

REICH (CONT'D)
It's called 'The Blue Spot.' It was
painted right after they discovered the
storm that circles the surface of the
earth, like 'The Red Spot' circles
Jupiter, returning again and again,
wreaking havoc... Nilsson killed himself
right after he completed it.

GARTH
Suicide doesn't exactly distinguish him,
does it?

REICH

No, not at all. So many people have
killed themselves. Still, it's a
magnificent piece. Most of these pieces
you see here I took into protective
custody from the Getty.

GARTH
I thought I recognized some of them.

REICH
Which is why I need you, Major.

GARTH
I told you. I'm not a major anymore.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 15.

REICH
yanks a tarp from a table miniature of an estate.

REICH
Come see this.

Garth reluctantly joins him.

REICH (CONT'D)
Do you recognize it?

GARTH
The Vincent estate.

REICH
Yes. It's located across the four-oh-five
from the Getty, in the Sepulveda Pass.
It's nearly as big, too. Are you familiar
with Vincent?

GARTH
Just that he's rich.

REICH
Was rich. No one's seen him in years.
He's probably dead. Still, his estate
remains operative... You may have
wondered how it is that we have electric
lights here, elevators that work and so
on, when the rest of the city has been
reduced to the stone age. It's because
UCLA has a nuke in the basement. It was
installed for educational purposes, but
it's large enough to supply the entire
facility with power...

Reich searches Garth's eyes for understanding. Finally:

REICH (CONT'D)
Vincent installed a duplicate in his
estate. It's fully automated, powering a
specially designed security system.
Vincent intended to convert his estate
into a museum on his death, but the world
fell apart first. I want you to break in,
Major... break in and shut down Vincent's
nuke, so I can take all of Vincent's art
into protective custody.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 16.

GARTH
(cynical grin)
Protective custody?

REICH
Oh hell, I could call it stealing, but
the truth is, it'll only be in my hands
until I die, and then the next fellow
will come along and protect it.

GARTH
You could say the same thing about
gold...
(eyes drifting toward the
palets of food)
-.. while other valuables are consumable.

REICH
(smiling)
Yes, that's true... So, what do you say?

The shadows across Garth's eyes hide deep thoughts.

LATER - GARTH AND REICH SIT AT TABLE

enjoying a sumptuous meal. Candlesticks, wine, dishes filled
with ample portions.

Nearby, the table miniature.

REICH
-.. thing is, the roof is protected by
surface-to-air missiles, SAMs. Anything
that comes within a thousand yards of the
place is blown up.

GARTH
You tried it?

REICH
Hm, yes.

GARTH

Why not assault it from the side?

REICH
The grounds are protected by miniature
battle units — tanks, in reality,
although they were manufactured to look
like dogs.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 17.
CONTINUED:

GARTH
With just the equipment you have over
there...
(gestures crates across room)
++. you could take out something like
that.

REICH
The entrances are made of six inch armor
plate, but we could get past that, too.
It was proven during the middle ages that
any wall may be breached. No, the problem
is, I don't want any of Vincent's
collection damaged.

GARTH
Go in a window, then.

REICH
You make it sound so easy. I hope that it
is. A window, yes. The real problem is
not getting in, but staying alive once
you're there...

(on Garth's look)

I have much of Vincent's security plans.
Some, anyway. He employed a new kind of
controller, a sentient computer system.

GARTH
The computer reasons? Like a human being?

REICH
Here. Let me show you.

Reich removes a notebook computer from a briefcase beside the
table, opens it. A picture of DIANA LOGAN, 28, appears on the
screen. Diana is beautiful, yes, but behind her eyes resides
an incisive mind and a depth of feeling unusual in one so
young.

REICH (CONT'D)
Twenty years ago this woman, Diana Logan,
was dying of cancer. Vincent convinced
her to transfer her consciousness into
his one-of-a-kind mainframe, which he
named EnCrypt. She lives there still,
inside Vincent's mansion... a kind of
apparition within his computer.

Garth studies the face. It reminds him that once flowers

bloomed, that there was hope in the world, that people were
young and beautiful. He closes the notebook lid.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 18.
CONTINUED:

GARTH
She controls all of the security systems?

REICH
Yes. As well as maintenance and repair.
As I said, the Vincent mansion is fully

automated.
GARTH
Is she programmed to kill?
REICH
Oh yes. If necessary.
GARTH
How do I defeat her... the system, I
mean?
REICH

You defeat each subsystem separately. But
in order to defeat the entire system, you
must shut down the reactor. It's located
in the basement, along with the
supercomputer that controls everything.
Obviously, this area presents the
greatest challenge.

GARTH
Obviously.

REICH
There is one additional thing I haven't
mentioned yet... research that Vincent
was doing... the last copy of which may
be in the computer. I want you to
download it before shutting the system
off.

GARTH
What kind of research?

Reich considers not telling him. He delays, sipping wine,
cutting another bite of meat. Then:

REICH
Vincent was researching weather
control... a way to stop the storms — THE

STORM — and return the earth to its
original weather pattern.

Garth laughs. Redemption? It seems absurd.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 19.
CONTINUED:

GARTH
You want me to save the world?

Reich smiles too.

REICH
Yes. Could you please?... It's probably
nothing. Vincent is missing and in all
likelihood dead, not an indicator for
success, is it? Still, even if his
research is partially completed...

 

GARTH

stands and walks to the window. The city lights are fires
consuming furniture and dreams. Reich joins him.

GARTH
The world's dying while you play
potentate inside these walls. Hell, it's
already dead. What you see out there is
nothing more than the death rattle.

REICH
No. What you see out there is a thinning
of the herd. From ten billion people to
maybe a million... a necessary event...
and we who are to survive will need a
return to the old weather cycle... and
art, too, if we are to remain civilized.
Download the data if you can... but shut
down that nuke.

The SOUND of a firefight some distance away.

REICH (CONT'D)
My competitor from the South Bay. She
pushes north with an army twice the size
of mine. She's flush with booty from that
shopping center down there, the biggest
one in the world. It's made her strong...
That's why I'm pulling out, Major,
relocating to the Central Coast after the
storm passes. I want the Vincent estate
before I leave. And I plan to leave the
moment the storm clears. That's how much
time you'll have, two, maybe three days.
After that I blow my way in and take
whatever's not destroyed.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 20

FOLLOW GARTH AND REICH

as they walk past the palets of food and supplies.

REICH
I want you to have a good night's
sleep... be at your best before you go
in... Is there anything I can get you?

Companionship, maybe?
Garth stops before the eight-by-eight-foot cube of food.

GARTH
I do nothing... until this is delivered
to my camp.

REICH
(laughs)
Half. The rest when you come out.

Garth gestures assent.
REICH (CONT'D)
(calling)
Sergeant LaPiere.

The elevator door opens revealing LaPiere and two former LAPD
cops.

REICH (CONT'D)
Show the Major to his room... then

arrange to have half of this food
delivered to his camp. Tonight.

INT. GARTH'S ROOM - NIGHT

The room is splendidly attired, subtly illuminated. LaPiere
allows Garth in, then closes the door behind him.

Garth begins to remove his clothes.

Movement in the corner of the room. A WOMAN steps out of the
shadows. She is lovely. Her greek gown insinuates that she
possesses nothing else, just this garment. Clearly, this
situation is new to her and she's afraid.

WOMAN
I'm... yours, if you want me.

Garth doesn't know what to say.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 21.
CONTINUED:

The woman releases the gown and it slips away. The strain of
this, the humiliation, tugs on her expression. She steps up
to Garth, waiting for him to touch her. She will not cry. No.
But the struggle makes the muscles of her face dance with
restrained emotion.

Garth pulls the bedspread from the bed and wraps her in it.
She clutches the garment about herself, thankful. Finally her
brow finds his chest. She sobs. Garth's arms almost close
about her, but he hesitates. After a moment:

GARTH
Who were you?

SLAVE
I was... a CPA.

She looks up. Her intelligent eyes search his.

SLAVE (CONT'D)
Who were you?

The question has many answers. Finally:
GARTH
A civilized man.
THE NEXT MORNING
finds the woman asleep beneath the covers, and Garth waking
above them. He rises from the bed, begins to dress.
THE DOORWAY - LAPIERE
stands just inside, grinning smugly.
LAPIERE
Forget that stuff. We've got new clothes
for you. You can even shower, if you
want.

IN THE SHOWER - GARTH

stands beneath the spray of hot water. The feel of it reminds
him of clean yesterdays.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 22.

LOCKER ROOM - GARTH

exits the shower to find a stack of clothes on a bench, and
new boots beneath it. He dresses.

RESIDENCE - GARTH AND REICH
observe his notebook computer screen.

REICH
Have you faced automated defense systems
before, Major?

GARTH
Many times.

REICH
Then you know that Vincent Industries
supplied much of the world's automated
security and combat systems. He made
everything from sentry dogs, like
these...

INSERT - SCREEN (AND INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

where the SENTRY DOG lopes onto the screen, then TRANSMORPHS
into an animated blueprint. The animal looks like a large
bulldog.

RESUME GARTH AND REICH
looking at the screen.

REICH

(continuous )
+... to more commercial combat platforms.
This particular model can be configured
as a strictly urban, house protection
system, or it can carry weapons. In the
case of Vincent's mansion, the dogs are
fully armed. We tested the perimeter to
find out.

GARTH

(disdainful)
Who went in? LaPiere?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 23.
CONTINUED:

REICH
No. Unfortunately our man was killed. You
knew Captain Leon Vega of the Army
Rangers?

The name impacts.

GARTH
I trained him...

REICH
Yes. He mentioned you before he died...
Inside the Vincent mansion there are
other platforms, several that were on the
market, and possibly a number that
Vincent was developing but had not yet
finalized. Almost certainly you'll find
the Ghost.

THE GHOST comes up on the screen. It indeed looks like a
ghost, a floating apparition, but it has teeth — weapon
barrels, which are shown when the device TRANSMORPHS into an
animated blueprint.

REICH (CONT'D)
It fires a mini-pulse bolt that can both
stun and kill, depending on the

are possible. Its design was intended to
scare off intruders first, so there is a
mercy factor built in.

GARTH
Mercy factor...

REICH
There are other weapons platform
possibilities. We've listed all that we
know about Vincent Industries equipment
in this notebook computer. Take it with
you. Familiarize yourself with Vincent's
defense mechanisms. My advice, though, is
to expect the unexpected.

Garth closes the notebook, considering what he has got
himself into.

Reich and LaPiere watch from nearby as the ARMORER brings
what appears to be a metal flak jacket to Garth and fits it
to him.

ARMORER
Have you worn force-field body armor
before, Major?

GARTH
No.

ARMORER
I'm not surprised. It was just introduced
during the last days of the Pentagon...
Now, it's battery operated. This read-
out...

He places a WATCH-LIKE DEVICE on Garth's wrist.

ARMORER (CONT'D)
--. here tells you your count. Generally
speaking, the armor is good for
approximately a hundred rounds of five-
point-five-six, or seventy-five rounds of
seven-point-six-two. Grenades and pulse
weapons take a toll of anywhere from ten
to a hundred points, depending on the
proximity of impact. You follow?

GARTH
I follow.

ARMORER
Good. Now this is a battery pack.

The armorer straps a BATTERY BELT to Garth's waist.

ARMORER (CONT'D)
It holds twenty additional batteries.
They aren't interconnected for reasons of
shorting out or chain reaction. You
understand? This armor is electrically
operated.

GARTH
I get the concept.

ARMORER
You must change the batteries between
firefights, or whenever a battery becomes
depleted. Some batteries may provide
protection past the hundred mark, but
don't count on it.

The Armorer takes an M-16 off a table and points it at Garth.

ARMORER (CONT'D)
(to Reich and LaPiere)
Gentlemen, you may wish to stand back.
Glancing rounds will deflect.

Reich and LaPiere retreat five paces.

Garth can't believe he's about to be shot at. He steps
forward...

The Armorer BEGINS FIRING. The ROUNDS HIT GARTH repeatedly
until the magazine empties. EACH ROUND HITTING THE BODY ARMOR
CAUSES IT TO 'FLASH' AS IT REPELS THE FIREPOWER.

The Armorer switches magazines as Garth, angered and
surprised, attempts to march forward again and take the gun
from the Armorer's hands. Garth is again THROWN BACK BY
SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS, and then to the floor.

The Armorer reloads, begins firing again as Garth tries to
get up, finally succeeds, assaults forward toward the Armorer
as he reloads yet another magazine, and begins firing again,
throwing Garth back. Garth topples behind the table.

The Armorer switches to an AK-47.

ARMORER (CONT'D)
Switching to a larger round...

These heavier rounds throw Garth back to the wall. MOST
ROUNDS HIT THE ARMOR, FLATTEN AND SLIDE TO THE FLOOR, WHILE
GLANCING BLOWS DEFLECT LEFT AND RIGHT.

ARMORER (CONT'D)

(shouting over din)
It's advisable that you seek cover when
being fired upon. While armor-deflected
rounds can't penetrate, the concussive
force of the round...

(changes magazine, starts

firing)
-.. can disorient and in some cases
render the recipient unconscious. I am
avoiding the Major's head area for
demonstration purposes. An enemy won't be
so lenient.

The Armorer finishes his last magazine and puts the AK-47
down.

Garth rises, shaken, and marches for the Armorer, who raises
a hand, signalling 'Stop.'

ARMORER (CONT'D)
(big smile)
Just kidding.

Garth stops, trying to control his anger.

GARTH
You son-of-a-bitch, you didn't warn me!

ARMORER
Major, you have just taken eighty direct
hits. Under normal circumstances, one
would have been enough to kill you. How
do you feel?

Garth grabs the smaller man and nearly lifts him off his
feet. After a moment:

GARTH
I feel... SWELL.

Garth drops the Armorer and surges past as Reich and LaPiere
share a look of amusement.

INSERT - THE RECHARGER PACK

in the Armorer's hands is tugged open, revealing slots that
accept body armor batteries, and dials for adjusting the
equipment.

INT. THE ARMORY - THE ARMORER (SCENE)
twists the pack for Garth to see.

ARMORER

The pack has its own armor. Don't let it
take direct hits if you want to continue
supplying power to your body armor. The
unit accommodates ten batteries at a
time, and can recharge them from cold to
hot in about an hour. You'll go in with
ten batteries charged in here, plus the
twenty on your belt. Got it?

This time Garth sneers at him and yanks the pack out of his
hands.

GARTH
How many recharges?

ARMORER
Thirty. Maybe less. Battery technology is
freaky... but you can connect to one-ten

and recharge the batteries directly from
house current, presuming there is house
current.

AT THE SELECTION TABLE - GARTH

stands before a number of rifles and pistols arrayed on the
table. The Armorer, Reich and LaPiere watch from five paces
away.

ARMORER
What do you want?

GARTH
What do you got?

ARMORER
Everything.

GARTH
Then what do you recommend?

ARMORER
Pulse rifle.

He picks up the pulse rifle and throws it to Garth.

ARMORER (CONT'D)
(continuing)
Has the punch of a fifty with almost no
recoil. Uses the same batteries as the
armor, fifty rounds of decreasing
intensity. Has a tendency to start fires.
That could be problematical...

REICH

Garth looks at him a moment, then:

GARTH

GARTH
Too bulky.

ARMORER

GARTH
Let me see it.

The Armorer removes a metal pen from his shirt pocket,
presses a button. The shaft elongates to four times its
original length, bow arms pop out at one end, a handle at the
other. He places it in Garth's hand.

ARMORER
Carries five shafts inside the tube. No,
wait, you twist the eraser... there.

Garth twists the eraser and five tiny metal arrows slide into
his palm.

ARMORER (CONT'D)
You preload the weapon, collapse it, and
keep it in your shirt pocket, or clip it

Garth mounts a metal arrow in the bow... looks up with an
admiring smile... and TURNS AND AIMS SO FAST IT IS ONE CLEAN
MOTION. THE ARROW SHOOTS OUT... and PINS THE ARMORER'S SHIRT
TO THE WALL. An inch left, neck, not shirt.

Garth walks to the Armorer, who is shaking with fear, and
pulls the arrow out with his fingers.

GARTH
Just kidding. How do you feel? Do you
feel swell?
(on Armorer's emphatic gesture)
I thought you would.

AUTOMATIC DEFENSE UNIT

on a display table. It is a coffin-shaped box. The Armorer
activates a control panel that pops up, switches it on. An
automated machine gun rises, its microservos 'whirring' as it
revolves left, then right.

THE ARMORER, GARTH, REICH, LAPIERE

observe the weapon. The Armorer is still shaken from Garth's
‘joke. '

ARMORER
This is a fully automated night defense
mechanism. Turn it on and it will shoot
anything moving beyond a four foot
perimeter. So you can catch some shut-
eye.

LAPIERE

Hope you don't toss in your sleep.
Garth depresses the ‘off' button and the machine gun recedes
inside its box with a SNAP!

the central atrium, then downstairs to
the computer, shut off the nuke. Then
work your way to the roof and call us.
We'll come in. Simple.

Garth grins cynically at the word 'simple.'

Beyond the chopper windows, the Los Angeles basin stretches
like a vast archaeological dig, fires rising like pillars to
support the smoky sky.

EXT. VINCENT MANSION MOUNTAINTOP - DAY

The chopper maneuvers carefully to avoid the top of the
mansion. The structure is huge, a competitor of the Getty
itself, three stories high and god knows how many stories
below ground, its style inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's
Hollyhock House.

The helicopter lands in the field outside the mansion
grounds. Garth drops out with his equipment. The chopper
rises and speeds away.

FOLLOW GARTH

as he trudges to the mansion's outer walls. They are low,
knee-high so as not to block the view of the mansion. Garth
stands before them for moments with nothing happening. He
picks up a stone and tosses it over the wall.

SENTRY DOGS

appear from either side of the structure and run full-tilt
toward Garth. They are mechanized animals that mimic the real

thing.

Garth watches them approach, doesn't move, weapons still
holstered or strung.

The dogs stop at the wall.

GARTH
Nice doggy... I'm outside the wall. See?

The dogs bark menacingly.

Garth removes one of the Smith & Wesson pistols from his

The barking increases.
Garth SHOOTS. ROUNDS SPIT OUT at a rate of five hundred a
minute. THE FIRST DOG IMPLODES. The second shoulders to the
wall itself, increases its barking.
GARTH (CONT'D)

Can't attack anything outside the

Garth replaces the magazine. Aims it at the remaining dog.
Considers.

GARTH (CONT'D)
Ciao, Fido.

Fires. The dog staggers back beneath the CONCUSSIVE FORCE OF
THE STREAM OF BULLETS, then EXPLODES.

Everything is startlingly quiet. Garth replaces the magazine,
reholsters the gun, stares out at the grounds.
GARTH'S POV - THE VINCENT MANSION GROUNDS

invites a stroll... a picnic... an afternoon in Elysium.

Garth leaps the fence and enters the grounds.
No dogs. No response. Nothing.

Somehow, Garth was expecting more. He shrugs, moves for the
house.

Halfway across the grounds Garth freezes.

this defense.

An instant later two more dogs spring from either side of the
building and run toward him.

Garth drops to one knee, pulls the pulse rifle off his
shoulder, brings it up to fire...

A BULLET HITS DEAD CENTER and knocks Garth off his feet. THE
BODY ARMOR FLASHES. A second round hits. A third.

THE DOGS

have Garth bracketed, firing from automatic rifles that have
risen from slots located in their backs.

He ejects the battery from the armor, slams a fresh battery

stands admiring the main entrance. It is a two-story bronze
double-door, with carved Roman figures presenting a battle
tableau.

Garth steps back onto the lawn, ten paces away, looks left,
then right.

GARTH'S POV - THE WINDOWS

steel plate have none of the elegance of this door, but are
formidable nonetheless.

A small EXPLOSION.

The door swings open.

INT. ENTRANCE OF VINCENT MANSION - DAY

Garth carries his equipment into the room.

The door swings shut behind him.

Garth drops his packs, tests the door with a shove. Locked.

GARTH
Thought that was too easy.

Garth turns to survey the room.

GARTH'S POV - THE ENTRANCE ROOM

is a vast hall that recedes into the shadows. The lights are
not on. Doors line the walls to either side, each two-stories
tall and each a different shade of green or red.

A statue of the god Jupiter, four times human size, commands
the near space.

Nothing. No response.
GARTH (CONT'D)

You can come out now, Diana. I know

Silence.

Garth shrugs, turns to unload his packs.

A ROBOT
rolls past Garth, who pivots and pulls one of his pistols.
The robot is a jumble of appendages tipped with various

devices. It proceeds to the door, which opens to receive it.
A welding device begins to make repairs on the main lock.

The robot lumbers into the shadows down the vast hall.

Garth pivots and aims the light.

Garth's rounds begin to impact all around it... then a direct

lowers the weapon and the light. He turns, quickly surveys
the dark ceiling down the hall, then moves.

Garth returns to the second camera site... aims... fires...
moves on.

A third site, opposite wall. The same.

A fourth site, same wall. He aims both light and weapon.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - GARTH FAR BELOW

WRIST READ-OUT

Garth's body armor wrist read-out: 09.

GARTH

realizes that another blow like that will penetrate his body
armor and kill him.

Should he move?

Carefully, Garth moves one arm back several inches, then the
other. A leg rises, seeks footing. He shoves himself a foot
farther away from the weapons in the walls and ceiling.

Again. Again. Slowly. Trying not to draw fire. Again.

Garth freezes.

DIANA LOGAN

stands in Garth's path looking down at him. She is not quite
real. She is not quite a ghost, either. She wears an outfit —
military tunic and slacks — that, while very feminine, is
also all business.

DIANA
You are an intruder.

Garth can't quite believe he's not alone. He raises a leg,
moves his shoulders, and shoves himself another foot away
from the weapons... and into Diana, passing through her. He
looks for her source.

GARTH'S POV - THE IMAGE PROJECTOR

Garth flips over and begins to crawl.

with the nightgoggles shoved high onto his forehead, walks
down the gallery, carrying the pulse rifle lazily in one

hand.

The repairbot lies a jumble of twisted metal and smoking
circuit boards.

Helen stares down at him from her pedestal.
Garth stops to appraise her.
GARTH
That kid doesn't know anything, Helen...
You're a hotty.

Helen's pose does not change, although the flashlight in
Garth's hand shifts her shadows as he moves forward.

Garth crosses the sealed beam that activated the film before.
DIANA AND THE CHILDREN APPEAR.
DIANA
This gallery is called 'The Greek Room'
because the antiquities displayed here
originated in classical times. Does
anyone know what ‘classical’ means?

CHILDREN
I do! I do!... No, me! Me!

GARTH
Oh, christ, not again...

ONE 3-D IMAGE OF DIANA STEPS THROUGH A SECOND 3-D IMAGE,
followed by a new shoebox projection device.

DIANA
The controller is located in that panel.
You can turn the tour off.

Garth is conflicted. Could the panel be boobytrapped?

CONTINUED:

DIANA (cont'd)
Well, I can't operate it. That's for
sure.

Garth steps to the wall, opens the panel, presses the 'stop'
button.

TOUR DIANA
-.. yes. ‘Classical’ means 'pre-
Christian,' or before the rise of—

TOUR DIANA AND THIRTY CHILDREN ARE SWALLOWED WHOLE BY
DARKNESS.

Garth pivots and marches back to his ‘camp.'
Diana, and her shoebox, follow.

DIANA
Who are you?

GARTH
I'm alive. You're dead. That's all either
of us needs to know.

DIANA
I know what I am.

GARTH
You're a program, a doppelganger...
You're not real anymore.

DIANA
I am a disembodied human being. Vincent
Enterprises developed a way to move my

consciousness into this computer... all
of it... me.
GARTH

Are you sure?
Diana has no answer for this.

DIANA
What are you doing here?

GARTH
That should be obvious.

DIANA

Why haven't the police come? Why don't
they answer?

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 49.
CONTINUED:

GARTH

I told you — there are no police.
DIANA

What's happened to the world?
GARTH

The same as you... Worse.

Garth begins to gather up his equipment and supplies.
DIANA
If you go any further, you'll wish the
police came and stopped you.

GARTH
Is that right?

DIANA

This facility is defended by a non-
commercial upgrade of a Vincent Embassy
Protection System — VEPS. In case you're
too ignorant to know what that means...
fully lethal defense systems. Killing
machines, Mr. ...

Garth brings the pulse rifle up.

The shoebox retreats into the darkness.

Diana BEGINS TO FADE, lose resolution, as the device
retreats.

DIANA (CONT'D)
Please stop destroying my —

Garth fires.
KABLOOM!

DIANA WINKS OUT.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GARTH

finishes gathering his supplies, carts everything down the
gallery.

As he crosses the sealed beam mid-gallery:

DIANA (CONT'D)
They're inoffensive. They carry no

Garth looks at her for a long moment.

GARTH
You have a point. Get to it.
DIANA
My point is that I don't want you to die.
GARTH
You care about what happens to me?
DIANA
Of course I do...
GARTH
And your boss, Vincent... he cared when

he installed all these killing machines
to protect his expensive trinkets?

DIANA
He never expected to need them! He
installed them as a deterrent.

GARTH
So he never expected anyone to get
killed?
DIANA
Of course not.
GARTH
Or hurt someone, even?
DIANA
No!
GARTH

Then I should be dodging blanks now...
You were Vincent's Chief of Security even
before you died, right?

DIANA
Yes.

GARTH
You don't strike me as the kind of person

DIANA
It's a little late in my career to start
quibbling over qualifications, don't you
think?... But I have a masters degree in
police science.

GARTH
You and Vincent were friends, correct?
DIANA
You're trying to insinuate something.
GARTH
And you're a good looking woman... or
were.
DIANA

(cynical grin)
You bastard!

GARTH
Not a new observation... So you were
lovers for awhile... then he rewarded
you.

DIANA

I hope your death is quick and painless.

DIANA DISAPPEARS .

Garth grins.

WHAM!

THE GALLERY DOORS

at the end of the hall slam open and a dozen flying mini-
helicopters bank through.

GARTH

yanks the

nightgoggles down, brings the rifle up.

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE FLYING MACHINES

carry fully functional weaponry from their undercarriages.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 52.

(SCENE) GARTH
STARTS FIRING even as he leaps toward the statue of Helen.
PULSE BEAMS BEGIN FLASHING all around him.

CHOPPERS BEGIN FALLING, SPIRALING, EXPLODING AS THEY ARE HIT.

Garth hugs the base of the statue, believing that its
presence will protect him.

Until a pulse beam from a helicopter SLICES THE STATUE IN
TWO.

Garth is without cover as the statue disintegrates above him.

Garth's weapon is on full automatic: Boom-boom-boom-boom..

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE MINI-CHOPPERS

continue to swoop down, firing pulse beams. There are seven
left.

GARTH

checks his wrist read-out: 04.

Garth slams another battery into his body armor.

A PULSE ROUND SLICES THROUGH HIS ARM before the power jerks
on. He grimaces in pain.

Garth's rifle is empty. The read-out, in red: 0.
Garth tosses the rifle and pulls both S&W autopistols.

He swings the fully automatic pistols together, creating a
minigun, AND FIRES.

The remaining HELICOPTERS EXPLODE within the sweep of
bullets.

Silence.

Garth shakes marble dust from his clothing, kicks chunks of
Helen away. Part of her face lands on his shoulder. On his
look:

GARTH
Must be a fake.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 53.

(SCENE) - RIFLE - GARTH

staggers out from the destroyed statue of Helen, retrieves
the weapon.

GARTH
Now that wasn't so bad, was it?

Takes stock. His left arm is bleeding. Clothes ripped.
Hungry. Tired. Thirsty. Licking his dry lips, he turns to
retrieve his canteen —

WHEN A STREAM OF BULLETS HITS HIM, slip-sliding his body
uncontrollably across the floor.

THE TANK

is little more than treads with a machine gun mounted on it,
now wheeling through the far open doors.

GARTH

slides behind the statue of Achilles. It must be real. The
bullets stop.

Garth pulls himself from a stupor, takes stock.

Arm still bleeding. Clothes still torn. Fingers move. Feet,
too.

Wrist read-out: 03. Another battery shot.

Garth reaches to pull a fresh battery from his belt, exposing
an arm WHERE BULLETS RIDDLE THE WALL AN INCH TO THE RIGHT.

Carefully now, he replaces the body armor battery.

The movement causes the machine gun to track him. Up-down,
left-right, servos whining. Only the statue keeps the unit
from firing.

DIANA'S SHOEBOX

rolls up behind the tank, halts as if concerned about being
shot by Garth, then advances.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 54.

DIANA MATERIALIZES

near Garth.

DIANA
You're hurt.

GARTH
Go away.

DIANA

You should apply direct pressure to that.

GARTH
I said... GO AWAY!

DIANA
I know who you are.

Garth tries to stop the flow of blood by applying direct

pressure. He winces.

GARTH
(preoccupied)
You do?
DIANA

You're Major John Garth, United States
Army Rangers. You were born in Pasadena,
California, in March —

GARTH
So you found my goddamn records!

DIANA
Why is an honorable man like you breaking
into a private residence?

GARTH
There are no more honorable human beings
— just hungry ones.

DIANA
Is that all? You're hungry? I can tell
you where there's food. Tons of it.

GARTH
Tons of it?

Garth moves slowly, watching the weapon track him.

GARTH
And you're going to show me how to get at
it... without getting my dick shot off.

Diana says nothing for a long moment. Then:

DIANA
If you drop your weapons, VEPS won't take
action against you.

GARTH
You mean... if I surrender, I can walk
around here without being shot at?

DIANA
No... You'll be taken into custody, held
for —

GARTH
The police.

DIANA

That is the procedure.

GARTH
There is no police.

DIANA
So you say.

Garth shifts. The machine gun follows him, servos whining.
The statue continues to provide cover.

GARTH
Why don't you just... turn the machines
off?

DIANA

I can't do that.

GARTH
Aren't you the Chief of Security? Aren't
you the soul of the machine? Why can't
you just stop shooting at me?

DIANA
It doesn't work like that.

(CONTINUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 56.
CONTINUED:

GARTH
Your mind controls everything, doesn't
it?

DIANA
Yes, but... the defensive equipment is

linked to my autonomic nervous system. I
can no more stop the defensive units than
I can stop breathing.

GARTH
You aren't breathing. You're a goddamn
ghost.

Diana thinks about that for a second. Yes, that's exactly
what she is.

DIANA
My mind works the same way as when... I
was alive. That's why Mr. Vincent gave me
this opportunity, to remain... alive...
inside EnCrypt.

GARTH
Where is Vincent, by the way?

Diana turns away, considering the question.

(SCENE) GARTH
throws the spent battery.

The tank gun tracks the flight of the battery into the
darkness.

Garth leaps out from behind the statue and lands on the tank.

The tank gun barrel tries to find Garth, who stands above it,
beyond its tracking range.

Garth pulls a survival knife, begins to pry open the tanks's
metal access plate.

The tank's treads SQUEAL as it accelerates toward the nearest
unadorned wall. Garth hangs on, prying with the knife.

The tank slams into the wall, almost throws Garth, backs up,
slams into the wall again.

Garth clings to the machine gun barrel, yanks off the access
plate, stabs the knife deep into a row of circuit boards.

CONTINUED:

The tank SPITS SMOKE AND SPARKS, DIES.
Garth removes the ammo feeder, tosses it into the darkness.

Sucking for wind, sweat cascading from his skin, Garth eyes
Diana warily as she slowly walks to the tank.

DIANA AND GARTH
study one another for a long moment before:

GARTH
If you can't shut the damn things off...
maybe you can warn me.

DIANA
Warn you?

GARTH
You know where everything is, don't you?
You know which machines are operational,
which ones are in stand-by mode, which
ones—

DIANA
Really, this whole question would be a
moot point... if you just surrendered.

GARTH
So you can hold me for the police?

DIANA
Certainly. You have less to fear from
them...
(looking back toward the
darkness)
-.. than me.

GARTH
That might be a long wait.

DIANA
So you say.

GARTH
You might save my life... if you briefed
me on what to expect.

Diana considers that possibility for a moment. Then:

DIANA
This is not the pattern of a burglar. A

gone.

Garth merely looks at her image as it moves.

DIANA (CONT'D)
If there really is no police, as you
say... then you've come to cut the power
and take everything. That...
(surveys him)
.-. is why I won't help you.

GARTH
If I cut the power, what becomes of you?
DIANA
I will become what you say I already am.
GARTH
Death as a blackout. I've feared worse
things.
DIANA

Go now. Take whatever you find back
there. If you go forward, you won't
survive.

Garth retrieves his rifle, slides a fresh battery into it. It
HUMS.

GARTH
Yeah, I've heard that before, too.

Diana considers this exchange a moment, then DISAPPEARS.

DIANA'S SHOEBOX

whines away into the darkness, passing through the opened
double doors at the end of the corridor.

GARTH

gathers up the rest of his equipment, drinks from the
canteen, limps back to the pack.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 59.

AEROSOL SPRAY SKIN

flows onto Garth's wound, sealing everything. Garth tosses
the can away, rips open a low-tech field bandage, gently
places it on the wound in his arm.

IN A CORNER OF THE GALLERY - GARTH
crumples against the wall. Depleted, he must rest.

An afterthought, he pulls the Automatic Defense Unit from the
pack, opens the panel, flicks it on.

THE GUN

rises from its coffin-shaped container and enters 'ready'
mode, barrel poised to fire at any target that presents
itself.

GARTH

makes sure that he's within the four-foot fire-free zone
around the gun, then removes the gunbelt and makes himself
comfortable. He searches the pack for fast energy food. The
bite-sized snacks fall through his fingers like coins.

GARTH

Chicken gumbo... (tosses it)... Steak
Tartar with red dye number seven...

Combat is getting elegant.

Debris of combat gives way to shining floors and pools of
purple nebulae.

FLOAT THROUGH THE CORRIDORS

past Garth sleeping on the floor... into the gallery of
paintings... through opening doors into the gallery of
jewels... through more doors into other realms of historic
order... until a woman waits at the end of the gallery.

ELAINE is beautiful, with long, flowing red hair and skin the
color of porcelain. Her green-green eyes glow like emeralds,
her red lips not tainted by makeup but truly red, teeth as
perfect as creation before the end of Eden.

GARTH

stands before her. He is not wearing torn combat clothes, but
a suit styled by future hands.

ELAINE
John... how I've wanted to hold you
again.
GARTH
Elaine, let me take you home.
ELAINE
(shaking her head 'no')
I have a different home now... Do you

know what became of me?
This is a question he would rather not contemplate.

GARTH
I searched for you, Elaine, I did!

ELAINE
There was no food, Garth. There was
nothing. Our son was hungry. I kept
waiting for you to come, but... you
didn't. So I went out looking for food...
The market was empty. There were men
there, Garth. They raped me. Then they
butchered me and took my flesh to their
homes and fed their families with me.
This last thing I didn't mind. I saved a
child's life. At least, my body did.

Garth can take this story no more.

The pain is more than he can bare. Garth drops to his knees,
tears and snot and saliva spewing from him as he bellows his
pain.
ELAINE
(reaching to touch, but unable)
Don't mourn me, John. What's done is
done. But you're still alive.
GARTH
I'm not alive, Elaine. None of us is
alive anymore!
ELAINE

Yes you are. You owe it to those of us
who are dead — stay alive, John!

INT. GALLERY

Garth snaps awake beside the wall. Nothing has changed from
when he went to sleep. Except a haunting SOUND drifting from
a far place. Garth turns off the Automatic Defense Unit,
grabs his rifle, moves for the far double doors.

GALLERY OF PAINTINGS - GARTH

stops at the threshold, snaps the nightgoggles down, looks
in.

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE GALLERY OF LANDSCAPES

No sensors. No weaponry in the ceiling.

GARTH

pushes the goggles up, considers.

The haunting SOUND is closer, but still not close.

Garth leaps into a run down the gallery toward the noise.

As he passes a closed beam mid-gallery, DIANA AND HER THIRTY
CHILDREN APPEAR as 3-D projections.

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - GALLERY OF PORTRAITS

Again no sensors, or weapons.

GARTH

advances into the hall. The SOUND is closer now, a haunting,
otherworldly wail.

Gath brings the pulse rifle up, checks the charge (100 in
green), advances.

The SOUND grows louder, louder yet, increasing in volume and
emotion, a noise so terrifying that its existence seems
impossible.

A GHOST

floats through the far doorway and turns, heading toward
Garth. It is the corpse of a man, arms and legs dangling,
eyes glowing red, the wordless wail rising from its throat.
GARTH

grins.

GARTH
Ah, a ghost...

Garth brings the pulse rifle up, takes his time aiming. He
FIRES.

The ghost TWISTS IN THE HOLD OF SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS, writhing
and bellowing its unearthly, artificial SOUND until its
DISGUISE AS A GHOST LOSES DEFINITION AND THE MACHINE BEHIND
IT CAN BE PERCEIVED. It begins to falter.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 63.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GARTH

is so preoccupied with the ghost that he doesn't see the man-
sized robot roll toward him from behind. The robot grabs him
with huge pincer-arms, causing Garth to drop the pulse rifle.

The robot's momentum carries them past the sealed beam which
ACTIVATES YET ANOTHER DIANA 3-D projection.

DIANA
Okay guys, this is the fun gallery, at
least for me... These are all portraits
of real people from history...
(etc. )

Garth writhes in the hands of the robot, its STEEL FINGERS
CLOSING ON HIS BODY ARMOR, WHICH SPARKS WITH RESISTANCE.

Garth's single free hand slams against the robot's metal
skin, without effect.

Garth pulls the survival knife, rams it into a crevice in the
robot body, jerks it, snapping off the tip of the blade.

The robot turns with Garth's splayed body, moving for some
dark destination.

A last ditch effort, Garth slams the broken blade into one of
the paintings as they pass. The blade digs deep into the
canvas and is dragged an inch before the robot halts.

(SCENE) THE ROBOT'S SOULLESS EYES MEET GARTH'S

in crystal understanding: If the robot continues, Garth will
destroy the painting.

Moments pass as Garth's lungs suck air and sweat cascades
from his brow.

The blade moves a millimeter in the canvas flesh, a woman's
bosom.

The robot's eyes move to the painting, back to Garth.
One robot hand relaxes. On Garth's movement, the other.

Garth slowly pulls himself from the robot's grasp, steps
down.

While the steel hands are empty, GUN BARRELS LOCATED IN THE
ROBOT'S CHEST follow Garth's every movement.

CONTINUED:

Moments pass. Garth reaches for the fallen rifle.

The robot watches.

Garth's fingers almost make contact with the weapon. Will he
have to release the knife in order to retrieve the rifle?
Garth gives up, withdraws his hand... and extends a leg,
makes contact with the rifle.

The robot whirls and accelerates down the gallery, its tracks
squealing in retreat.

Garth releases the blade and retrieves the rifle, brings it
up to shoot.

The first round hits the retreating robot as IT WHISKS
THROUGH THE 3-D IMAGE OF DIANA AND HER CHILDREN like an
aircraft through clouds.

Garth FIRES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN...

PULSE BOLTS STRIKE the robot repeatedly. It explodes in fire
and wanders off track, finally stopping altogether.

An unearthly SOUND makes Garth spin around.

MORE GHOSTS

float across the threshold of the far gallery, each different
in its horrific representation — a child, a crone, a woman,
aman...

(SCENE) GARTH

begins firing immediately.

So do the ghosts — PULSE BOLTS THAT STRIKE GARTH'S ARMOR AND
FLASH.

The FIRST GHOST IS DESTROYED, the child.
The SECOND, the crone.

The THIRD, closing with Garth, DIES IN AN EXPLOSION of
metallic flesh.

But by the time he turns the pulse rifle on the fourth, the
woman, the rifle is depleted. Garth retreats.

dives for his waiting S&W pistols as the GHOST CONTINUES TO
FIRE PULSE ROUNDS at him.

Garth brings the PISTOLS UP AND STARTS FIRING.

The ghost ABSORBS THE ROUNDS AGAINST ITS METAL SKIN, its
‘ghost' persona fading to reveal the stainless steel monster
beneath.

Both weapons are emptied of bullets.

The ghost floats menacingly before Garth for seconds, THEN
DROPS LIKE SCRAP TO THE FLOOR.

Garth sags to his knees, finally begins reloading the
weapons.

ELAINE'S VOICE

3-D ELAINE,

wearing jean cutoffs and a pull-over, STRUGGLES WITH AN

anger and tears.

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE GALLERY OF LIGHT CARVINGS

GARTH
quickly shoves the nightgoggles from his eyes and rubs them.
DIANA MATERIALIZES before him, projected by a new shoebox.
DIANA
This is the Gallery of Laser Carvings.
Everything in here is very fragile. If a

I sometimes feel the same way when a

bullet whizzes past my head.

Garth pushes through her into the gallery.

GALLERY OF LIGHT CARVINGS - GARTH

quickly checks the ceilings for sensors or laser rifles.
None.

Garth grabs his equipment, begins moving forward.

THE STATUES

are 3-D projections of light carved by an artist to represent
life and projected up from a base. Think Kodachrome. Some of
the statues are modern and geometric. Others are almost
indistinguishable from life — a fawn, a waterfall, a soldier
in combat, lovers holding hands, others.

A STATUE OF A NUDE WOMAN

catches Garth's attention. He moves for the exhibit.

The statue is twice life size. She is gathering flowers to
her breast, a garland of flowers in her hair. Her expression

is one of rapt beauty, a representation of a woman at peace
in a peaceful world.

It is Diana.

DIANA AND GARTH
look up at the light carving.

DIANA
(unconvincing)
I'm not ashamed of it.

Garth drops his packs, circles the statue, saying nothing.

DIANA (CONT'D)
I was a graduate student at UCLA... Mr.
Vincent was one of the pioneers of laser
carving.

GARTH
You can stop calling him 'Mr.' now.

DIANA
(an outburst)
I'll call him any damn thing I want!...
(controlling herself)
... He pursued me to model for him.
Finally, I relented.

GARTH
Was he that good... or were you that
good?

Diana looks away angrily. Then:

DIANA
Mr. Vincent's interest in me... exceeded
the professional. He was in love with me.
I never returned the affection.

GARTH
You're lying.

DIANA
What?

GARTH

He bought you. He bought you with a job
and he bought you with a laser statue.
You want me to believe he didn't buy the
rest of you too?

DIANA
You son of a bitch!

DIANA

Unless what?
Garth considers not going on. But:

GARTH
When you were diagnosed as terminal, did
you get a second opinion?

DIANA
Of course I got a second opinion!

GARTH
Not one of Vincent's doctors?

DIANA
No! What are you implying?

GARTH
He won you after all, didn't he? I mean,
he got to keep you, young and beautiful,
in his one-of-a-kind supercomputer...
never to grow old... never to die...
immortal and his, forever...

 

Diana charges Garth. Just as HER 3-D HAND WOULD MAKE CONTACT
with his face, SHE DISAPPEARS.

THE NEXT GALLERY DOORS

are also locked. Garth places the explosive, steps aside, and
the lock EXPLODES.

Garth flips the nightgoggles down, glances in.

GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE HALLWAY
is unadorned and relatively narrow, a real passageway.

No sensors in the ceilings, no weapons that can be seen.

GARTH

hefts his equipment and enters the hallway.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 73.

A FLASHLIGHT BEAM

slices the darkness. More doors, more hallway.

The flashlight swung in the opposite direction reveals
shining metal doors: An elevator.

GARTH

moves down the hall toward the elevator, flashlight beam
leading the way.

He drops the pack, surveys the elevator controls.

THE ELEVATOR CONTROLS

require both a key and a key card.

GARTH

drops the pack, removes the computer, runs a line from a rear
port to a card, inserts it into the card slot adjacent to the
elevator.

The computer begins running numbers through the card key.

Garth finds a small case in the pack, opens it: Burglary
tools.

Garth begins to pick the standard lock.

DIANA APPEARS BESIDE GARTH

DIANA
So you're a common burglar after all?

GARTH
(working)
Uncommon. For the CIA.

DIANA
Fair play's poster children.

GARTH
I'd argue the point... but it doesn't
really matter anymore, now does it?

Diana allows the vitriol to recede. Then:

DIANA
(wryly)
Well, you've seen me naked. I thought
that would count for something.

GARTH
Get on with it.
DIANA
If you go downstairs... I can't protect

you.
Garth turns, gives her his full attention.

GARTH
Protect me?!

DIANA
You don't really think you've defeated
all of our security systems by yourself,
do you? What if I had sent them all at

once?
GARTH
Bullshit.
DIANA
No. It's not... John, listen to me —

downstairs is different. Mr. Vincent's
residence is there, the computer room,
the weapons storage bays... There's a
stand-alone system down there, fully

automated, a terrible killing machine

that —
GARTH
(returning to work)
Bullshit.
DIANA

It's called The Rook. It was designed to
replace soldiers on the battlefield. It's
dormant now, in a state of suspension,
but as soon as your heat signature is
read on the bottom floor, The Rook will
activate and it will kill you.

Garth searches her eyes for any signs of deception, then
realizes that he is looking at a machine projection. He
shrugs and returns to jimmying the lock.

The elevator door slides open.
Garth steps back. After a moment:

GARTH
You're lying... First, your defense
mechanisms were designed to deal with
terrorists — plural — more than one.
They're set to activate individually, as
needed. That's why you didn't send them
all at once... Second, you'd say anything
— do anything — to keep me from going
down there. Am I right?

Garth gathers his equipment, turns away from the elevator.

DIANA
Where are you going?
GARTH
That elevator opened too easily... and

you control it.

THE HIDDEN DOOR

is a panel in the wall. Garth finds it, presses it. It opens.
A stairwell leading down.

Garth flips the nightgoggles down, takes a look:

THE STAIRWELL

hides no weapons.

GARTH

hefts his equipment, enters.

STAIRWELL - GARTH
descends the steps quickly, flashlight beam leading the way.

At the landing, Garth tries the door. Locked. He'll have to
blow it.
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 76.

THE LOCK IGNITES

and the door swings ajar.

GARTH
swings the door open with the barrel of his pulse rifle,
revealing:
THE VINCENT RESIDENCE
is a cavernous room, a vast "pleasure dome" to compare with
Kublai Khan's. Laser statuary, nudes mostly, illuminate the
shadows, a glowing Christmas tree effect. Fountains and ponds
divide the real estate, a waterfall across the room defines
it. There are park benches, grassy knolls, trees hanging low
with weighted boughs, jutting boulders, and room enough to
live forever unencumbered by petty problems.
DIANA'S SHOEBOX
rolls to the open door. Diana's IMAGE PROJECTS out.
Garth remains across the threshold.
DIANA
Don't do this. The moment you enter, The
Rook will be activated.

Garth snorts with disbelief and enters.

Dazzling lights flash on the moment he crosses the threshold.

THE VINCENT ARMORY - A ROOK,

a humanoid creature with steel skin lies immersed in a wall
tableau, art and war meeting in bas relief.

Its eyes open, red pupils scanning.
THE VINCENT RESIDENCE - GARTH

the room.

GARTH
Vincent certainly knew how to live,
didn't he?
Diana says nothing, but her image follows him.

GARTH (CONT'D)
Where'd he sleep?

Diana gestures: Over there.

THE VINCENT BEDROOM

is not delineated by walls. A huge bed seems to grow out of a
giant oak, its mattress almost like a meadow of green.
Overhead, man-made stars twinkle even in room light.

Garth wanders up a lane toward it, eyes taking in everything.

THE VINCENT ARMORY - THE ROOK

moves minutely as below it a computer screen flashes: ROOK
INITIATING PROTOCOL - INTRUDER ALERT.

THE VINCENT BEDROOM - GARTH

touches the oak bed. It feels like real wood, with no rough
edges.

Diana's shoebox projector follows, as does she.

GARTH
When you have this kind of money... this
kind of power... I guess you can have

anything you want.

DIANA
Mr. Vincent was known for his
imagination.

A quarter-sized statue of a nude man and woman in embrace
stands near the bed. Garth touches it and the two come to
life and begin to make love.

GARTH
You didn't pose for this one too?

Coital cries erupt from them.

Taking a close look at the woman's body.

GARTH
She looks a little like you... here and
there.

DIANA
(exasperated)
Touch it again! Please!

Garth touches the light statue and it returns to its
point and freezes.

GARTH
(gesturing other statuary)
Who were all these people?

DIANA
Mr. Vincent had many lovers.
GARTH
The man in the sculpture... that was
Vincent?
DIANA
No... maybe... I don't know! Please leave

here! Now! I'1l do what I can to stop
anything from happening to you, but
you've got to get out of here now.

GARTH
For a woman who's spent the last twenty
years inhabiting this place, you don't
seem to know a lot about it.

DIANA
I don't spend that much time in the
residence.

GARTH
Why not?

DIANA

Garth merely looks at her.

DIANA DISAPPEARS .

creature, which was in cryogenic stasis. Its body temperature

is rising.

DIANA MATERIALIZES beside him.

DIANA
The Rook is activated! It's coming!

Garth observes her coolly for a moment. Then:

then tell me how to protect myself

GARTH
Why should you care so much about me?

DIANA
You're a human being, aren't you? You're
alive. You can't appreciate life until
you've lost it.

The admission impacts Garth. He sits up.

GARTH
If you can't tell me how to defeat this
thing, then tell me about it.

DIANA
The Rook is a fully autonomous combat
operative. Its body armor is five times
more effective than the obsolete armor
you wear. This model has been programmed
to kill with its hands, to protect
property. It will tear your head from
your body.

GARTH
What are its weaknesses?

DIANA
It has no weaknesses!

A BOOM SOUNDS distantly.

A HALLWAY - THE ROOK

slams through a set of doors moving fast.

RESIDENCE - GARTH

stands, retrieves his rifle, the pack.

Garth retrieves several bricks of C-4 from the pack, tosses
the pack through the door, begins kneading the plastique
together.

DIANA
Run now! Do it! Leave!

Garth finishes kneading the C-4 into a glob the size of a
baseball, tucks it away in a pocket, brings the rifle up.

A BOOM SOUNDS, closer.

The Rook enters the residence at full run, already targeted
against Garth.

Garth brings the rifle within his sights and BEGINS FIRING at
full automatic.

Boom-boom-boom-boom! The pulse BOLTS STRIKE THE ROOK without
effect.

The Rook leaps obstacles and continues forward with
inexorable power.

Garth's pulse rifle empties.

The Rook hits Garth at full tilt, slaps the rifle away,
shoves him back, fingers reaching for Garth's throat.

Garth resists the creature's hands. His BODY ARMOR SPARKS as
it cycles toward depletion.

Momentum carries Garth through the doorway and into the
stairwell.

The Rook pushes Garth into the wall, fingers encircling his
neck, ARMOR SPARKING.

Garth struggles to bring his hand containing the C-4 up. The
plastique falls.

The compressive force of the Rook's hands begin to strangle
Garth through the armor.

Garth struggles, reaching for the C-4 on the ground. It's
inches away.

The Rook's red eyes bore into Garth, programed hatred.
Garth begins to gag.

The shoebox scoots into the stairwell. DIANA PROJECTS. She
sees Garth's fingers reaching for the plastique.

Diana's eyes lock with Garth's. An empathy passes between
them impossible for the Rook to understand.

The shoebox accelerates into the C-4, sending it rolling into

Garth slaps the C-4 onto the Rook's back.
His other hand reaches for a battery in his beltpack.

Garth's BODY ARMOR WRIST READ-OUT: 33... 26... 19... 15...

Garth's fingers pull a battery from the beltpack.

HUMMM — tries to stand, slips, finally reaches his feet.

GARTH
Where is it?

Diana gestures toward the end of the stairwell.

Garth staggers several steps in that direction, stops.

Its body armor blown, the Rook's chest RECEIVES THE BULLET
ROUNDS like darts through Playdough.

Garth EMPTIES THE PISTOLS, has no time to reload.
The Rook grabs Garth's ankles and crawls up his fallen body.

Garth plunges his damaged survival knife deep into the Rook's
bullet-pocked chest. No effect.

The Rook's hands close around Garth's neck.

Garth slams the knife repeatedly into the machine's body.
Nothing.

Beneath the Rook's flesh bio-mechanical devices ooze and
revolve, levers pushing limbs.

Garth's fingers reach for the railing, something to push
against, to rise. No.

The Rook's fingers close about Garth's neck.

Garth has lost control of the knife, which sticks from the
Rook's chest, its metal blade fostering sparks inside the
machine.

Garth grabs the knife handle, pulls, loses it, pulls again,
again, finally dislodging the knife.

The Rook squeezes Garth's neck, twisting, trying to wrench
his head from his body. Garth gags.

Garth's body armor wrist gauge reads 23... 17... 14... 09...

Garth raises the knife and plunges it deep into the Rook's
head.

The Rook's eyes go wide, then fail.

The Rook falls from Garth's body, tumbles down the steps,
bursts into flames.

GARTH

gasps for air, sucking oxygen into his lungs like water
through a busted dam. After several long moments he staggers
to his feet and descends the stairs, stepping carefully

around the Rook's burning torso.

Diana waits at the foot of the steps.

Diana's image seems to sit down beside him. After a moment of
recovery:

GARTH
You're on my side now, is that the idea?

DIANA
Is that all you've come to do, steal?

Garth considers the question a moment.

GARTH
Vincent was supposedly on the verge of a
discovery that would return the earth to
its original weather pattern. Do you know
anything about that?

No.

GARTH (CONT'D)
That secret is supposed to be contained

I'm not the computer. I just live in
it... But no, I'm not aware of anything

staring far off, elsewhere, directing the battle in the
armory.

Yes!

GARTH
Maybe there's something wrong with the

DIANA

John, the creature is approaching...
GARTH

I DON'T CARE!... Check the files.

Diana's eyes close. The HUM of the great computer's synaptic

stream down at an unreadable rate. Graphs, blueprints,
representations of the new plant's DNA flicker into and out
of existence. Then:

Garth rushes the command console.

GARTH
I'll do it! Show me how!

Diana pulls her gaze away from the door just as its color
begins to change.

DIANA
I can't. It's a temporary device. Vincent
didn't integrate it with the rest of the
systems. You'll have to set it off
manually, from the roof.

globules that deteriorated the door reunite with the
creature.

react as the creature slithers/walks into the room. The
creature struggles to hold its human form, twisting,
undulating until... VINCENT'S EVIL GRIN appears on its face.

Startled, Diana almost screams.

Garth switches his rifle to full auto and sprays the amoeba,
causing it to splatter against the far wall.

Far end of the room. Go!

Garth grabs his equipment, turns to leave:
GARTH
Shut off the surface to air missile

DIANA
Why?

GARTH
Just do it!

Diana gestures assent. They share a brief moment eye-to-eye,
then Garth turns and rushes for the far reaches of the huge
room.

DIANA

turns to face the reforming creature. She disappears and the
shoebox rushes for the amorphous biomass slithering toward

her.

The shoebox slugs into the mass and is swallowed whole.

GARTH

slides to a stop beside the door, twists its knob, finds it
locked and jams his survival knife deep into the wood of the
jamb. It splinters.

Garth rises and slams through the door.

The ooze lands on the door and begins to commingle with it.

wedges the survival blade into the jamb, securing the door.
Garth quickly ascends the steps to the next landing.

Below, THE DOOR GARTH SECURED BEGINS TO WAFFLE, its
constituents weakened by contact with the creature. It sags
open and the creature enters.

AT THE NEXT LANDING - GARTH

blows the doorknob off the door just as A SMATTERING OF GOO
thrown from below SPLATTERS ONTO HIS BODY ARMOR WITH A HISS.

Garth ignores the goo and leaps through the door to the final
landing below the roof.

chopper begins to wing in.

Garth opens the control panel.

GARTH

takes the remote controller out, snaps it onto his belt, then
studies the seeding device controls as Reich's chopper lands
near the center of the roof.

Reich, LaPiere and six men with weapons exit the chopper.

REICH
You did it!

GARTH
The last defensive device is coming up
those stairs right now. Send your people

the pit. Once everyone has emptied one clip, they reload and
descend.

REICH OBSERVES GARTH

as he prepares to activate the controls.

REICH
What are you doing?

GARTH
You were right. Vincent developed a way
to fix the weather. I'm setting the
timers that will blow the roof and seed
the incoming storm.
Reich thinks about this a moment.
REICH
No shit? Reverse the weather?

They OPEN FIRE, FULL AUTOMATIC.

ON THE ROOF - REICH AND GARTH

stare at one another, Garth's finger poised above the
activate button.

REICH
All I'm asking is... just think about
this a minute, will you?... We could evac

being eaten by the goo flung by the mother creature.

electromagnetic shield. LaPiere tosses it into the darkness
below and retreats up.

off now, no one can take credit, but if
we wait, spread the word, rally people to
our side, and then set it off — there's
no limit to how strong we can become.

GARTH
No. Now.

REICH
No. Later. When I say so.

Garth shakes his head 'no.

REICH (CONT'D)
You're a tough nut, Major...

Something slaps Reich behind his head. What's that? Keeping
the weapon aimed at Garth, HE REACHES BACK WITH HIS LEFT
HAND, FEELS SOMETHING ON HIS SKIN, brings the fingers before
his eyes so he can see.

REICH (CONT'D)
What the hell?

Garth pivots and runs.

THIRD SEEDING DEVICE - GARTH

slides home, flips open the controller and begins tapping in
the activation delay. Behind him, in the distant background,
REICH SPINS MADLY, SCREAMING.

Garth activates the device, then stands.

Reich's VOICE GOES SUDDENLY SILENT.

Now there's only Garth and the creature left on the roof.

And one remaining pod to be programed.

Garth leaps into a run toward it.

RUN WITH GARTH

less so distant background unidentified items are tossed into
the air as the creature approaches quickly.

Garth freezes.

THE CREATURE (SCENE)

slowly undulates up into a mound, then a miniature peak, then
a crude mimic of humanity, and finally into a monster of a
man. Vincent's awful face draws into a smile.

Garth draws the Smith and Wessons and BEGINS FIRING, leaping
away.

A PORTION OF THE CREATURE, JUST FLUNG, SPLATS against a roof
brace behind where Garth stood and slithers down.

The creature LOSES VISCOSITY AS THE STREAM OF BULLETS HITS IT
and it collapses.

Garth leaps across the puddle and runs on.

THE FOURTH POD - GARTH

drops to his knees, opens the control box and begins
programing the device.

A dark form rises behind him.

Garth accidentally programs in '50:00' rather than '5:00'.
Cursing:

GARTH
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

He must start all over again.
The form behind him is larger.

Finished, Garth stands. He notices the dark form behind him.
He turns.

REICH

stands there, HALF HIS BODY CHALK, SHAKING WITH THE CERTAINTY
OF HIS DEATH. He reaches out an arm at Garth but it falls,
like a cigarette ash, to the floor and disintegrates.

What remains of his living flesh turns chalk-white and
disintegrates TO REVEAL:

THE CREATURE

standing behind him.

Goo from REICH'S BODY DRIBBLES AWAY, THEN SCOOTS to the
Mother Goo.

Finger on the ACTIVATE NOW button, Garth looks back over his
shoulder.

Garth hits the buckle, snapping the armor loose, and throws

nearly falls over it, drops to a knee, opens the cover,
smashes the faceplate and presses the ACTIVATE NOW button.

The pod BLOWS just as Garth leaps away.

amorphous tentacles grip Garth and pull him back.

His reaching hand is jerked away from the ACTIVATE NOW
button.

Garth bellows in pain as the GOO ABSORBS INTO HIS SKIN. White
blotches begin to appear.

Garth's boot catches a cable line and holds as the creature
pulls on his prone body.

Garth reaches for a pen in his pocket. It's the miniature
crossbow seen earlier. Arms spring out, a trigger. The bolt
snaps into place with a flick of his wrist. Garth aims...
aims... and fires.

THE POD CONTROLLER - THE ACTIVATE NOW BUTTON

is pressed home by the flying bolt.

GARTH AND THE CREATURE
are blown back by the explosion.

Garth lands ten feet away. The GOO IS SLOWLY PROCEEDING UP
ONE ARM, changing his flesh, killing it. Garth rubs it, as if
to return circulation, but it doesn't help.

Garth sees the creature reforming, moving toward him. He
tries to move but he's been hurt far more than he thought. He
sags, waiting death.

A DAMAGED ROBOT

from an earlier confrontation with the creature surges
forward. In its hands, a cable whose end has been stripped,
revealing naked wires. The robot spears the creature with the
cable. SPARKS AND SIZZLING FLESH. Moments pass as the
CREATURE CONTINUES TO LOSE VISCOSITY, sagging finally into
bags of amorphous jelly, and then decayed pools of chemicals.

Garth tumbles to the floor, tries to stand but his LEFT LEG
HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO WASTE MATERIAL. No living flesh there.

DIANA (CONT'D)

Diana snaps around to look, as does Garth.

The creature too is not what it once was. The beast fights to
retain its form and motion, but moves forward.

Garth tries to crawl faster, but can't.

She watches with mute horror as the creature absorbs the

Garth loses control of his body, collapses to the floor.

Portions of his back, waist, one leg, one arm are already

The outline of Garth's body jumps, then shakes in death
rattle.

Diana throws the full power of EnCrypt into the chair making
contact with the amoebic goo. EnCrypt's dormant synaptic
power rises to a terrible HUM. The creature fries, this time
not dissolving but burning. Pieces fly away, ashes fallen
from a bonfire. A BELLOWING MOAN rises from the creature as
it crumbles into hot dust.

SLOW DISSOLVE:
