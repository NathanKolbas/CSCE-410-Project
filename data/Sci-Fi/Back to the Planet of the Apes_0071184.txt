ROLL OPENING CREDITS EXCEPT THE FILM'S TITLE

FADE IN

ON A SANDSWEPT DESERT the midday sun bakes down on the hot dunes.
As far as the eye can see there is nothingness. The blistering
wind carries wisps of sand across the desert floor.

FROM OVER THE HORIZON comes a figure. The rising heat distorts
its image. We can barely make out what it is. It rides closer and
closer...IT IS A LONE HORSEMAN, however he is still too far to
see anything but that...A WOMAN'S VOICE begins to narrate as he

rides.

NARRATOR (VO)
And so the legend began...From the
dust of another time, another
era...they rose.

As the horseman trots closer, his face is shrouded in a scarf as
protection from the sand and sun. Still, we cannot see who it is.

Out of the sand they built an
Empire...Their civilization grew
fast and strong.

The lone horseman draws nearer. He dons a military uniform. A
machine gun is slung across his back.

For themselves they rewrote history
and created time itself. They were
powerful. They were unstopable.
They were...the Planet of the Apes!

The lone horseman comes to an abrupt stop. He pulls the scarf
from his face. It is GENERAL IZAN, the blackest of the black

gorillas.
THE FILM'S TITLE BURNS ONTO THE SCREEN:
RETURN TO THE PLANET OF THE APES

With snarling teeth and an intense glare General Izan puts a
am's_ ho n ws with a orce of his
we @ ECHOING BLARE rings throughout the desert.

WE CRANE UP over Izan's head. From the horizon an imposing ARMY
OF GORILLAS on horseback make their way across the sandy dunes.
Rudimentary military vehicles accompany the troops. They are an
angry looking lot.

AT THE SAME MOMENT from the opposite horizon, an ARMY OF
CHIMPANZEES, as mighty as the gorillas, charges forward.

The gorilla and chimpanzee armies COLLIDE like two brick walls.
There is an EXPLOSION OF THUNDER, and the sun disappears from
sight...SUDDENLY a giant billowing cloud of blood envelopes the
sky like a tidal wave of red cast over the fighting...Apes
slaying apes. The blood-red sky soaking all the color from the
picture except red itself. We watch the war sear on in SLOW
MOTION. The on lors...black and red.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
There was a day long ago when all
apes lived in peace.

FROM AN AERIAL VIEW we look down on the embittered battle.

But for years a brutal civil war
between the gorillas and the
chimpanzees tore the very soul of
the Planet of the Apes apart....
+--until now!

FADE TO BLACK
++as we hear festive music and cheering crowds.
FADE IN

EXT. APE SQUARE - DAY

Bright, brilliant sunshine...Ape Square is the nerve center of
the entire Ape Empire...the blood and brain of this unique
civilization. It {is the focal point of activity for occasions of
social and governmental importance. The mighty Square is lined
with great stone pillars that reach skyward. Today it is alive
with the excitement and emotions of peace. The gorillas and the
chimpanzees are about to end their savage, bloody civil war.

The MASSES cheer. Patriotic anthems fill the alr played by the
APE COMMUNITY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA all decked in their tuxedoes.

On public display are representatives of the two opposing sides,

the GORILLA ARMY and the CHIMPANZEE ARMY. At the front of the

gorilla army stands GENERAL IZAN. He's military through and

enzough: 5-4 1 the spirit and passion of this celebration is
ocused on...

THE REVIEWING STAND...An open-air, bleacher-type stone structure.
Banners and flags decorate the site. Seated side by side are
MINISTER ELIZAR TAFARA, the leader of the entire gorilla
population, and SECRETARY NEBB GURIO, his chimpanzee counterpart.
They are flanked by invited GUESTS and MILITARY AIDS, all spit-
and-polished in their dress uniforms. Amongst the dignitaries sit
the three highest court JUDGES...they are the eldest members of
the ape community, and the only three orangutans left in
existence. The CHIEF JUDGE, DR. ZANTHEUS, impressive in his long
black judicial robe, approaches the giant ramshorn-like
megaphone. He holds out his long arms to silence the crowd.

DR. ZANTHEUS
Fellow anthropoids...I stand before
you today with a most inflated
sense of pride.
DR ZANTHEUS (CONT'D)
This day is truly a shining
monument that will go down in our
history for all of ape and apekind.

Applause rolls like thunder.

DR ZANTHEUS (CONT'D)
Countless lives have been
senselessly sacrificed to the
thundering storms of civil war. For

2 been re

But now I can see the sun shining
through the clouds. Once again
gorillas and chimpanzees will
live in harmony...

The ape population EXPLODES INTO PANDEMONIOUS CHEERS. Gurio and
Tafara step to the megaphone. Tafara is an imposing gorilla. His
chest is decorated with a legion of military ornaments. Gurio,
though smaller, still presents a confident posture. He wears a
patch over one eye. Dr Zantheus holds up a scroll. It as the
long awaited peace treaty.

DR. ZANTHEUS (CONT)
I present to you Minister Elizar
Tafara and Secretary Nebb Gurio,
two apes of peace.

TAFARA

(bellowing out)
Thank you, Dr. Zantheus, Secretar
Gurio...As Commander of the Gorilla
forces I speak for all the brave
gorillas who have fought so
valiantly under the brilliant
military leadership of our General
Izan. Today we extend the hand of
friendship to our brother apes, the
chimpanzees.

Tafara salutes Gurio. They wave to the cheering masses.

GURIO
Chimpanzees have always been
advocates of peace, and so I sign
this treaty with great hope, and
vow that never again shall any ape
fight against his brother.

Embracing the moment the symphony strikes up a rousing political
tune. Ceremoniously Dr. Zantheus unravels the scroll. Two
DIGNITARIES step up to the lecturn and each hand Gurio and Tafara
a special pen. Simultaneously Gurio and Tafara sign the treaty.
Enthusiastically Dr. Zantheus holds the signed document above

his head. The music swells with patriotism. Everyone on the
reviewing stand is on their feet applauding vigorously. Gurio and
Tafara extend their hairy hands to each other. Ina final
gesture of peace, this historic handshake will solidify a future
of hope, when, SUDDENLY...

BANG! BANG!! BANG!!! BANG!!! GUNFIRE RIPS THROUGH THE REVIEWING
STAND LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTENING. Tafara's face explodes off his
skull as bullets riddle his flesh. Gasps and screams of terror
echo from the crowd.

A BULLET SHATTERS GURIO'S SHOULDER. Three chimpanzee BODYGUARDS
throw him to the ground behind the podium. They shroud his body.
Bullets tear into their backs.

GENERAL IZAN AND HIS RENEGADE GORILLAS SHOOT VICIOUSLY INTO THE
REVIEWING STAND KILLING GORILLAS AND CHIMPANZEES LIKE FLIES.
The bursts from Izan's machine guns flash like strobe lights.

DR. ZANTHEUS FALLS TO THE GROUND CLUTCHING HIS BLOODY CHEST.
Shock and horror bulge his eyeballs. His nervous system explodes
into one final convulsion before death. Mass confusion abounds.
There is no escape from Izan's unexpected rampage. Apes scatter
in all directions. A stream of bullets riddles through the
symphony. Instruments and musicians fly helter-skelter. TAFARA'S
CORPSE hangs over the podium. Blood pouring from his head.

Chimpanzee soldiers grab Gurio from underneath the pile of dead
bodyguards. They wisk him off the reviewing stand, disappearing
into the confusion.

Izan, in a bravado display of hulkish strength and ego, leaps
onto the reviewing stand. He reaches under Tafara's bloody
corpse, and yanks out the peace treaty. Holding it skyward, it
drips with Tafara's blood. With a heart stopping roar, he screams
into the megaphone.

IZAN
There will be no peace until the
gorillas rule this planet!

Izan then tears the peace treaty apart and shoots into the air.
Any hope for an end to the civil war has now been single handedly

destroyed by I[zan.
I will own this planet!!
TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE TO

APE SQUARE...All the crowds are gone. The burned and bullet-
shredded flags flap silently. The distant rumble of cannon fire
can be heard, a grim reminder that deep in the desert the war
rages on. A clean-up crew of HUMAN SLAVES sweeps the debris left
from the massacre. Human beings in the ape community are
regarded as animals. They do not speak and are seemingly
mindless. Each slave's ankles are bound in chains. Military
GORILLAS keep a watchful cruel eye on the labor force. The
crack of a whip across a slave's back is the main deterent to
sluffing off.

DISSOLVE TO
LIFE IN THE APE CITY

For the first time we see life as it evolves on a daily basis.
The ape civilization is almost reminiscent of ancient Rome.

Busy narrow streets lined with stone buildings wind and weave
throughout. The streets are frenzied with bazaars and VENDORS.
GORILLA TROOPS can be seen on almost every corner. The gorillas
have the city occupied and take pleasure in intimidating the
civilian apes. Ocassionally motorized military wagons make their
way down the crowded claustrophobic streets. All slave labor is
done by the HUMANS under the watchful eye and cracking whip of
the gorillas.

From the middle of a city street we CRANE UP above the roof tops
looking far into the desert which surrounds the city. There we
see a distant battle being raged. The mortar fire and explosions
ring louder and louder...

BATTLE THUNDER AUDIO BRIDGES AS WE CUT TO

A_motorized military wagon sitting ominously on the desert sand.
Tt lies in wait in the blazing noonday sun like a spider ready to

snag a fly, when all of a sudden...A Al K HAIRY HAND
reache to the pictu a ck the vehic off the ground.
The sounds of battle fade out as we...

PULL BACK to reveal we are not actually in the desert, but at
IZAN'S STRATEGY TABLE, which sits in the middle of...

INT. GORILLA TACTICAL PLANNING ROOM - DAY

The gorilla war room is a mess. Broken chairs and documents are
strewn about. Giant maps line the walls. On one side there is a
massive stone desk. The nameplate atop it reads: GENERAL IZAN.
Standing at the strategy table are Izan with several of his
battle COMMANDERS and war ADVISORS.

The table is a miniature battlefield. There is no doubt Izan is
in control. Everyape waits patiently as Izan amuses himself. He
throws his toy vehicle onto the table, making explosion noises
with his big gorilla lips.

IZAN
Okay, now where were we?

COMMANDER #1

Well siz, with a fully equipped
attack force taking the hill we
probably won't face any substantial
casualties, which should more than
compensate for the losses suffered
in the southeastern zone last week-
end.

As the Commander babbles on, Izan's brow furrows. He slowly
begins to pace behind Commander #1.
COMMANDER #1 (CONT'D)
Unfortunately we were caught with
our pants down, sir as the chimps
mounted a surprise attack on us
before most of the company had
awakened, sir. It was only lucky
that we...

IZAN
We suffered losses in the southeastern
zone and nobody told me?

COMMANDER #1
Well sir, in a manner of speaking.
However...

Izan takes his machine gun and unexpectedly, WHACK, he strikes
the Commander in the back of the head like a baseball player.
The Commander falls to the ground.

IZAN
Caught with our pants down?

Izan beats him with the butt of his gun.

IZAN
I'm trying to win a war here and I
don't have time for incompetence! I
hate suffering losses! I HATE
SUFFERING LOSSES!!

AT THAT MOMENT there {s a commotion in the hall. The door bursts
open. A Chimpanzee comes rushing in followed by two brutish
gorilla PRIVATES chasing after him. The Privates seize the
intruder and tackle him to the ground.

IZAN
What the hell's going on here?

As the Privates yank the chimp to his feet, we see he is
CORNELIUS.

CORNELIUS
Unhand me! Unhand me at once!

PRIVATE #1
Sorry General Izan, sir. This
little chimp got away from us for a
second. We'll take him out back and
shoot him right away.

As the Privates drag Cornelius across the floor...

CORNELIUS
General Izan, please, I beg a
moment of your time! My name is
Cornelius. I'm the head of the
Simiantarian Peace Organization,
and what I have to say concerns
CORNELIUS (CONT'D)
the destiny of all simian life as
we know it.

IZAN
Wait!

The Privates stop in their tracks.

I know who you are. You all
remember Cornelius, the chimp who
was laughed out of his psychology
and archeology positions for his
absurd theories on anthropoid
history?

The gorillas laugh at Cornelius.

CORNELIUS
That is I, sir.

Izan has sport with Cornelius.

IZAN
Not on some street corner today
making those ridiculous speeches
about rights for. humans or equality
for all apes?

CORNELIUS
No General, sir. I don't mean to be
disrespectful, but it seems to me
you're leading this Empire on a
road to self- destruction. Please
hear me out. Please.

IZAN
Come here.

Cornelius, scared but determined, approaches Izan.

You have a lot of guts, you little
chimp. Bither that or you're just
very stupid.

(laughing)
What say we hear this chimp's last
words? We could all use a good
laugh.

All the gorillas laugh with Izan.

CORNELIUS
Thank you. General Izan, if you
continue with this bloody civil
war...iÂ£ you do not put down your
weapons now and come to some
peaceful agreement with the
chimpanzees, and with
yourselves...you are going to
CORNELIUS (CONT'D)
annihilate all life as we know it,
just as was done before, when
humans ruled the Planet!

IZAN
Humans ruled the planet? That's the
funniest thing I've ever heard!
They're animals.

CORNELIUS

They didn't used to be. They buried
their entire race by fighting each
other, just like the apes are
doing, General.

(pleading)
Don't you see, if it happened once
it can happen again. If you do not
open your eyes to the truth now,
it'll be too late. And then my son
and all the other children won't be
given a chance to grow up, because
we didn't give ourselves a chance
to get along.

The room goes dead-still. Izan thinks pensively, then...

IZAN
Kill him!

They all laugh as the Privates pull Cornelius towards the door.

CORNELIUS

General, you're making a grave
mistake. Why do you think the
Forbidden Zone is forbidden to
apes? It offers proof of what I
say. I can prove the human
civilization existed. I can prove
that humans destroyed themselves.

(desperately)
I can bring you proof!

Still entertained by this absurdity, Izan calls out.

TZAN
Hold it! Hold it! What kind of
proof?

CORNELIUS
Proof of a human race that
destroyed itself before us. Proof
that will open your eyes. Proof
that ape evolved from man!

Hysterical laughter explodes.

IZAN
This I gotta see!
The Privates let go of Cornelius' shoulders. with trepidation he
continues.

CORNELIUS
General Izan, if I go to the
Forbidden Zone and bring you this
proof, will you consider the
consequesces of what I say?

IZAN
(with no
sincerity)
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Bring me your
proof.

CORNELIUS
Thank you, General. Oh, thank you.

As Cornelius nears the door, I[zan shouts to him.

IZAN
Cornelius?

CORNELIUS
Yes.

Izan picks up the limp corpse of Commander #1 from the floor and
heaves it over his head at Cornelius. THUD. The dead gorilla
lands at Cornelius' feet. Cornelius is mortified.

IZAN
Good luck.

All the gorillas belly laugh with vigor. Cornelius runs from the
war room as fast as he can. The laughter grows and echoes, as we

AUDIO BRIDGE TO

EXT. IZAN'S GORILLA WAR BUILDING - SAME TIME

Cornelius burst out of the doors and into the street. The
laughing still echoes in his head. He stops in the middle of the
road. Clutching his hands over his ears, he attempts to muffle
the demonic laughter, which drowns out the city sounds around him

DISSOLVE TO

EXT. DESERT ~- DAYBREAK

Cornelius rides along the desert dunes to the backdrop of a vast
expanse. His 3 year old son, PAX, shares the saddle with him. To
his left faint gunfire can be heard in the distance.

DISSOLVE TO
THE HEAT OF DAY. Cornelius and Pax cross the hot sands searching,
hoping. The white sun bakes down on these determined travelers.

DISSOLVE TO
10.

NIGHT HAS FALLEN as Cornelius and Pax warm themselves at a small
campfire he has built.

PAX
Father?

CORNELIUS
Yes Pax.

PAX

Why are some apes good and some
apes mean?

CORNELIUS
I don't know. Maybe someday we

can figure that out together.
DISSOLVE TO

THE SUN SITS HIGH IN THE SKY. Cornelius and Pax search on.

Dismounting they look around. A glimmer of something catches

Pax's eye. Pax picks it up and hands it to his father. It is an

arrowhead. Cornelius looks around for other signs of life, but

sees nothing. No one. He sighs with disappointment. Have they

come ali this way for naught? It looks like it. He lifts Pax onto
e saddle.

CORNELIUS
Well Pax, it appears as if we've no
place else to look. Shall we go
home?...I do hope I don't hang for
this.

Cornelius is just about to remount his horse, when SUDDENLY...A
sack is thrust over Cornelius' head from behind. TWO HUMANS drag
a kicking and screaming Cornelius across the desert sand as a
third grabs Pax. They all disappear into a hole in the desert
floor. One of the humans pulls a boulder in over the hole to
conceal the opening. The five are gone without a trace. A soft
wind wisps across the sand. Corneliusâ horse stands alone.

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - SAME TIME

At a frenzied speed the humans drag Cornelius and Pax through a
seemingly endless, claustrophobic, subterranean labyrinth. Their
muffled screams are undiscernable. The artery winds like an
underground corkscrew. One of the humans carries a torch which
casts weird shadows along the cramped wet walls. Fast. They move
through the passage like blood through a vein. FINALLY...they
emerge in what appears to be...

INT. ANCIENT NEW YORK SUBWAY STATION - SAME TIME

The three humans pull Cornelius and Pax through this fossil that
was once a part of the great New York City. Torches line the
cracked tile walls. They race...Past an old overturned subway
car. Through the decrepit turnstyles. Along the smashed and
broken platform. They vanish into the darkness.
ll.

THE BURLAP HOOD IS PULLED FROM CORNELIUS' HEAD. He struggles but
cannot move. The humans have tied him to a chair with Pax on his

lap.

CORNELIUS
Untie us! What is the meaning of
this? Untie us!

IN A SMALL DARK ROOM OFF TO ONE SIDE OF THE SUBWAY TRACKS,
Cornelius struggles to free himself. The humans run from the

room.

CORNELIUS (CONT'D)
Wait! Wait! Where are you going?

Cornelius looks around nervously. His emotions are a mixture of
curiosity and fear. Pax hugs him tightly around the neck.

CORNELIUS (CONT'D)
Oh dear...Don't be frightened Pax.

He stares out the doorway at the subway tracks. He's never seen
anything like this before, then...Cornelius' eyes widen as he
hears a noise. Outside the doorway the silhouette of a small
human CHILD runs by. The child giggles.

SUDDENLY...the silhouette of a large human MAN steps into the
doorway. He carries a rifle. Although Cornelius cannot see his
face, he knows the man is staring directly at him. The
silhouettes of two human CHILDREN play at the man's ankles.
Slowly the man walks forward... Corneliusâ heart pounds in his
throat. Sweat beads on his brow. The man steps into a shaft of
light. His face becomes illuminated. Cornelius grins with
relief. He can't believe his eyes.

IT _IS_ TAYLOR.

 

CORNELIUS
(overcome)
Taylor!
Taylor its stunned.
TAYLOR

Cornelius? Cornelius is that you?

Taylor runs to untie them..

CORNELIUS
Taylor, thank goodness you're
alive.
The two embrace like the old friends that they are.
TAYLOR

I thought I would never see you
again.
12.

CORNELIUS
I can't tell you how happy I am to
find you after all these years.

TAYLOR
Well, you sure are a sight for sore
eyes.

CORNELIUS
I've missed you, my friend.

TAYLOR
I'm so sorry about the welcome. I
just had no idea it was you.
(looking to
Pax)
Is this your son?

CORNELIUS
Yes, this is Pax.

The three children all eye each other skeptically. The little boy
tugs at Taylor's leg. It is his 3 year old son, DUKE.

CORNELIUS
And who do we have here?

Taylor scoops Duke up into his arms.

TAYLOR
Cornelius, I'd like you to meet my
son, Duke. I named him after John
Wayne.

CORNELIUS
who?

TAYLOR
(chuckles)
Never mind. Duke this is my old
friend, Cornelius.

CORNELIUS

Well, hello.
DUKE

HL.
CORNELIUS

Oh, he speaks.
TAYLOR

Of course.

Cornelius looks down at the little girl .

CORNELIUS

And hello down there to you too.
13.

TAYLOR
Cornelius, Pax, this 1s Duke's
little friend, Ariel.

ARIEL
You look funny.

Cornelius and Taylor look at each other and laugh.

INT. SUBWAY COFFEE SHOP - LATER

The remnants of a once bustling commuter breakfast spot is now an
ancient ruin. The formica counters are warped. The walls are
chipped. And, the cushions on the chairs have faded to dust.
Taylor has fashioned it into his dining room. Cornelius and
Taylor sit in a booth feasting vegetarian-style. Duke, Ariel, and
Pax play on the tracks.

CORNELIUS
Â«..I look around and see what has
become of your civilization, and
know this {s what's in store for
ours if something is not done. I
beg you, Taylor, you are our only
hope.

TAYLOR
But I don't understand what I can
do. I am only one. And a human to
boot. Why would he listen to me?

CORNELIUS
Because you are proof that it has
happened before. Living proof of a
culture that was completely
destroyed by fighting itself.

TAYLOR
Look, my civilization fought a
thousand wars before one of them
finally blew everything up.

CORNELIUS
But Taylor how can you suggest the
apes take the same path as the
humans? You better than anyone
knows the grizzly consequences.

Playfully, Duke and Ariel run to Taylor. He takes them in his
arms and places one on each knee. Pax runs to Cornelius.

TAYLOR
Cornelius, listen, I understand why
you're scared, but I have a
responsibility here. Duke has
already lost his mother. What if
he were to lose me too?
14.

CORNELIUS
We have a lot in common, my friend.
hore than a fâ¬lrst glance might
tell.

Cornelius looks at Duke and as a father himself he feels deeply
for Taylor's circumstance. He suddenly realizes he has put
Taylor in a compromising position.

CORNELIUS (CONT'D)
Say no more. I understand... Now
show me around this...what you call
a subway.

Taylor obliges his old friend. Duke, Ariel, and Pax run off to
play. Taylor walks behind the archaic counter. Next to what was
once a cash register, Taylor picks up an object.

TAYLOR
Let me teach you a little something
about the twentieth century.

Taylor tosses the object to Cornelius. He's a good catch.

CORNELIUS
What's this?

TAYLOR
It's a package of Twinkies. A very
integral part of human existence.

Cornelius examines it curiously.

Go ahead. Eat it. It has a shelf
life of over three thousand years.

Cornelius rips open the cellophane. He takes a bite. It's still
fresh. He likes it.

TAYLOR
Come with me Cornelius. I think you
might find this interesting.

IN A SMALL ROOM off to one side Taylor shows Cornelius an
unexpected sight...a classroom in progress. A TEACHER is teaching
a group of about S HUMANS how to speak.

TAYLOR
Since I've been living in the
Forbidden Zone I've taught a group
of people some basics, speaking,
reading, thinking for themselves.
They're all very fast learners.

CORNELIUS
How positively wonderful.

TAYLOR
There's more.
1s.

INT. TAYLOR'S MAKESHIFT OFFICE - SAME TIME

Old decrepit chairs and vinyl couches line the filthy walls.
There is a rotted desk that Taylor obviously uses for his own.
From out of a desk drawer Taylor takes three large handbound,
handwritten books. History books.

CORNELIUS
Books?

TAYLOR
History books. A chronicle of the
human existence as I can recall it.

Cornelius thumbs through one of the books.

CORNELIUS
This is fascinating.

TAYLOR

Every night I write a few pages.
Things I was taught in school, from
TV, movies...I really miss movies.
My favorite was "Ben Hur".

(seriously)
I've been racking my brains trying
to remember history as it occured.
I can't let it be forgotten.

CORNELIUS
You've written so much. I had no
idea the humans had this much
history to tell.

TAYLOR
Cornelius, I've only scratched the
surface. Our great libraries were
stacked from floor to ceiling with
thousands of volumes of books, and
even they weren't able to tell it
all. I'm amazed at myself for
having remembered this much already.

CORNELIUS
Your son is lucky to have such a
father.

TAYLOR
He's why I started writing these.
So the history of the humans won't
be forgotten. So my child and all
the children can read about it for
generations to come...

Taylor stops. He thinks about what he has just said.

++-generations to come.

INT. LEAGUE OF ANTHROPOID NATIONS BUILDING - DAY

The General Assembly Room of the League of Anthropoid Nations is
a hot-bed of confrontation. The room is circular. Seated by rank
on multi-leveled risers are both warring factions. The
CHIMPANZEES occupy one side of the room. The GORILLAS the other
side. Nebb Gurio, leader of the chimpanzee forces, sits ina
position of control mid-way up the wall of his SOLDIERS. Izan is
at the other side of the room opposite Gurio. Seated in a booth
high atop everyone, the two remaining orangutan judges spectate.
Words fire back and forth like gunfire.

GURIO
You're mad! You're utterly mad!
There's no reasoning with a
barbarian!

IZAN
The time for reasoning has long
been over! If you want a single
chimpanzee to ever walk the Planet
again, you'll surrender now.

CHIMPANZEE COMMANDER
We'll never surrender!

IZAN
Then you're commiting suicide!

GURIO
You're commiting genocide!

IZAN
I Â£ight to win!

GURIO
Democracy will win out. Oppression
can never sustain itself.

Izan laughs.

GORILLA COMMANDER
Democracy is for the weak!

CHIMPANZEE GENERAL
Power to the chimpanzees!!

GURIO
Why can't you be more like Tafara?
He understood what it meant to want
peace and equality.

GORILLA GENERAL
You chimpanzees are doomed! Doomed!

IZAN
I_spit on Tafara!

He spits. Suddenly Izan's eyes dart to the center of the room.
17

A veil of silence falls over the apes as they stare with Izan...

There stands Cornelius. He holds Pax in one arm and Taylor's

hand-written history books under his other arm.

CORNELIUS
We are all doomed!!

TZAN
(snidely)
Well, well, well...What have we
here? The little chimp from last
week.

GURIO
Cornelius, you don't belong here.
Take Pax and leave at once before
you get hurt.

Two GORILLA GUARDS close in on Cornelius.

CORNELIUS
(cries out)
Wait! Wait! I have the proof I
promised you General Izan.
(holds up the
books)
I have your proof!

Izan howls. This {1s some fun! The guards make a grab for
Cornelius. He shields Pax. Izan waves off his apes.

IZAN
Oh yeah! Oh yeah, my proof.
(to everyone)
Now get this...Cornelius here
promised me he could prove that
thousands of years ago humans ruled
this planet. Humans no less!

For once the warring gorillas and chimpanzees have something to

laugh at together.

Not even lizards or dogs. Something
we could almost believe...But
humans!

Cornelius puts Pax down. He raises the books high above his head.

CORNELIUS
I bring you books. Hand-written
books. These books chronicle the
history of man as it is remembered.

IZAN
What kind of proof is that? Books?
CORNELIUS

If you read them you will see. They
tell all about life before...
18

IZAN
I don't care what they tell! How do
I know you didn't write them? How
do I know they're not the ramblings
of some crazed chimpanzee
imagination.

An ugly murmur starts to build in the room.

GURIO
Cornelius you have gone too far
this time.

IZAN

This bores me. You had your chance
Cornelius...Guards! Kill him!

The gorillas cheer. Panic seizes the chimps. The guards move
towards Cornelius. Pax clings to his father, fear on his little
ace.

CORNELIUS
TÂ£ you won't believe the books,
perhaps you'll believe the human
who wrote them!

All at once the entire League room GASPS. Confident and proud
Taylor enters the chamber. The guards freeze. Silence.

IZAN
You dare to bring a human into the
beague of Anthropoid Nations
Building?!!

TAYLOR
Cornelius didn't bring me. I wanted
to come.

Shock bounces off the walls. Every ape's jaw drops.

CORNELIUS
Fellow apes, this is my friend
Taylor.

TAYLOR

It's been a long time since I've
been amongst apes. How do you all do?

IZAN
This is a hoax! Get this ventriloquist
and his dummy out of here!

The guards are too spooked to move.

TAYLOR
You must be General Izan. I've
heard a lot about you General.
19.

IZAN
GUARDS!!
Cornelius steps forward...The guards are hesitant.
CORNELIUS

Please General, you've never heard
a human speak before. Why don't you
listen to what he has to say?

GURIO
I want to hear what he has to say!

Izan sits motionless. He peers down at Taylor with an evil eye.

IZAN
Amuse _me!!
Taylor takes a deep breath. All ape eyes are on him.
TAYLOR

I'm not a hoax General. I'm not a
trick. I haven't been trained to
mock language like a parrot. I ama
human being, and as much as you
apes want to hide from the truth,
there was a day when humans ruled
this entire planet.

There are some snickers bouncing about the room.

Sure, it's funny, I know. But why
don't zou ask the orangutans? They
know it's true. They wrote your
sacred scrolls and have been
keeping the human existence secret
from the moment apes stood upright.

Taylor points to the orangutans sitting up in the booth. One
hides his face in his hands.

What were you afraid of? Didn't you
realize by turning your heads from
the past and ignoring history,
you're doomed to repeat it?

A uneasy calm envelopes the room. Taylor continues.

There was a time when man had the
knowledge and power to clean the
oceans, cure the sick, feed the
hungry, and fly to the stars.
That's how I got here. I was an
astronaut. I flew through space and
time in a machine that humans
built. I know this must seem hard
to believe. You may very well be
asking yourselves, if such a great
civilization did exist, where {s it
20.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
now? Well, I am all that is left.
You see, with all the wonderous
things that humans could do, we had
one fatal flaw. The inability to
share. The unwillingness to
cooperate. The refusal to look upon
each other as equals. Man's great
downfall can be defined as simply
as petty greed. And it was that
greed, that insidious thirst for
power that led us to war after war
after war. And each war was the war
to end all wars...Until finally one
war ended everything!..... ee eeeene
I beg you, for the sake of your
race, don't make the same mistake
we made. Learn from our stupidity.
Learn from our selfishness. And
rise higher than man ever dreamt
possible. It's not too late. It can
never be too late.

You can hear a pin drop. Izan slowly stands. He removes his hat.
His expression is introspective and absorbing. SUDDENLY...Izan
pulls a pistol from his side. He points it at Gurio. BLAM! A
single bullet blows Gurio's forehead apart. His limp body flails
back. An arc of red follows. The warlords are shocked. Taylor is
mortified.

IZAN
Here's your peace and cooperation,
right here!!

Izan a hi tch. In one vicious assault, the guards grab
Taylor and Cornelius. A third guard yanks Pax out of Corneliusâ
hands. The baby screams.

CORNELIUS
(frantic)
Pax! Pax! No-o-o-o!!!

IZAN
(shouting)
The human parrot is right. There
can be no more war. That's why I am
declaring it over! [ win! The
gorillas win! The gorillas are in
charge, for now and always!

The gorillas explode with joy. The chimpanzees are in utter
chaos. They have been completely startled by Izan's violent coup
d'etat. An enraged chimpanzee GENERAL shrieks out to Izan.

CHIMPANZEE GENERAL
The Chimpanzees will never succumb
to the ways of the gorillas!
Chimpanzees will never yield. We
will never...

 
21.

Izan cuts him off in mid-sentence by shooting him. The chimpanzee
General falls forward. His corpse tumbles all the way down the
multi-leveled platforms and hits the ground with a sick THUD.
Pandemonium races through the League Room. Cornelius and Taylor
struggle to break free from the guard's grasp, but can't. Pax
eries. Izan leaps to his feet, over the desk, and all the way
down to the floor. He shouts at the top of his lungs, riddling
the ceiling with his machine gun bullets. Bits of stone and smoke

shower down.

TZAN
Silence! Silence! There is no
power greater than me!

A CHIMPANZEE VOICE
All the power in the world can't
change a single chimpanzee into a
monster like you.

TZAN
We'll see about that.

Izan's eyes dart around the room. He spots the guard holding

young Pax. Lik vulture Izan grabs Pax the skin on ck
of h neck.
CORNELIUS
No-0-0-0-O-0-0-0-0OFLLIiiitt

WHACK! The guard slams his fist against Corneliusâ face! Taylor
battles to free himself, but cannot escape the vice-grip of the
guard. Izan holds Pax over his head displaying him to everyone.

IZAN
Here this! I will raise this
chimpanzee as my son! I will train
him to be as mighty as any gorilla
you have ever known! Be forewarned
that one day the successor to my
throne will be this chimpanzee! And

will

this penetal ah be just like
me!

CORNELIUS

No, please, no! Pax...Pax! No-o-o!
TAYLOR

Let him go, you maniac! Maniac!
IZAN

Hang that human scum!

A raucous cheer races through the gorillas. Taylor's panicked
eyes widen. He is hoisted over the heads of the blood-thirsty

gorillas like a football hero.
22.

IZAN (CONT'D)
To the gallows!

Hooting and hollering the gorillas charge out of the League Room
led by Izan, who still holds Pax. Taylor, helplessly suspended on
the shoulders of the mob, disappears out the door like a twig
being washed away in a flood.

EXT. LEAGUE OF ANTHROPOID NATIONS BUILDING - SAME TIME/DAY

The apes pour out into the street. Izan leads the rabid crowd to
the gallows. The group swells with curious BYSTANDER APES, who
follow the soldiers.

AT THE GALLOWS... A permanent eyesore that sits in the middle of
town. Hordes of wild-eyed APES gather around the often used
execution spot. Izan catapults onto the gallow platform. A hooded
HENCHAPE stands next to him. The rope dangles...A disraught
Cornelius struggles helplessly in the arms of two neanderthal-
like guards. As Taylor is being carried by, he reaches out and
grabs Corneliusâ outstretched hand.

CORNELIUS
I'm sorry Taylor. I'm sorry. I'm so
sorry.

TAYLOR

Raise my son. Raise himas if he
were your own.

Their hands are yanked apart by the current of the moving crowd.
The henchape secures the noose around Taylor's neck!

IZAN
Fellow apes...in my first official
act as Supreme Ruler of the Empire
of the Apes, I declare the death of
this freak of nature! Any final
words human?

With resolve Taylor looks steely-eyed at Izan.

TAYLOR
YOU BASTARDS!

Taylor's voice echoes out through space. Izan grabs the lever
from the henchape. YANK. The trap door drops. CRACK. Taylor's
neck snaps. For a moment the only sound we hear is the creaking
of the rope. Cornelius closes his eyes and drops his head,
then...JUBILANCE EXPLODES. All the gorillas start to chant...

ALL THE GORILLAS
Hang Cornelius/Cornelius next/
Cornelius, Cornelius...

IZAN
Not Not Cornelius! Cornelius won't

Cornelius out of the city.

As the guards take Cornelius away, tears stream down his face...

CORNELIUS
P-a-a-ax...Remember me. Always
remember I'm your real father...I'm

Pax waves good-bye to Cornelius as Izan gloats.

A MONTAGE ENCAPSULATING THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS

The familiar voice of the female narrator from the beginning
carries us through time. It is the voice of Ariel.

DUKE, 5, runs happily across the desert. He giggles playfully.

ARIEL (VO)
Â«..And so Duke grew to love
Cornelius like he would his own
father. He raised him well.

Duke runs into Cornelius' loving arms. Ariel, 5, runs up to
Duke. They romp together with Cornelius looking on.

DISSOLVE TO

THE SUN IS HALF-WAY SET ON THE HORIZON. A brilliant hue of
lavender colors the sky. Cornelius, Ariel, Duke, and four other
young children, 3 BOYS and a GIRL, are silhouetted against the
sunset. They walk gingerly. The children do kid things, throw
rocks into the air, shuffle sand with thelr feet.

ARIEL (VO) (CONT'D)
As far back as we can remember
Cornelius fired our imaginations
with art, and stories, and songs.
He told us what it meant to be
human...He filled us with images of
the time from which Duke's father
came...And every night he would
read to us from the books Taylor
wrote about the history of man.

UNDER A BIG DESERT TREE Cornelius reads from the history books
Taylor hand wrote. Ariel and Duke listen eagerly. They are now
nine years old. Seated under the tree with them are their

friends DARA, CHARLIE, ALBERT, JONAS, and a few ADULT HUMANS.

unsinkable slipped under the icy

Everyone sits mesmerized.

THE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY

An archeologist's dream. It is evident Cornelius has been

excavating artifacts from the past out of the subway ruins.

Lining the subway floor are many everyday items from twentieth

century life. Eyeglasses. Dishes. A container of liquid paper. A

phonograph record. False teeth...Too many things to list. Ariel

and Duke and a group of HUMANS are busy digging up yesterday with
n.

ARIEL (VO) (CONT'D)
We also learned about the past
through archeology. This was
Cornelius' favorite thing to do,
and we always found lots of neat
things.

Duke and Ariel run to Cornelius with an oddity. An old toilet
seat with it's attached cover. None of these humans has ever seen
one before. The toilets they use are merely holes dug in the
ground.

DUKE AT 9
Cornelius, Cornelius, look what we
found.

ARIEL AT 9

What was it?

Cornelius curiously examines the object. He puts the toilet seat
around his neck. The seat cover rests upright against the back of

his head.

CORNELIUS
It appears to have been some sort
of ceremonial headdress.

DISSOLVE TO

A SHACK being constructed near a clump of trees. Cornelius, Duke,
Ariel, Charlie, Dara, Albert, Jonas, George the teacher, and
other HUMANS work together to build the dwelling. Other simple
shacks can be seen in the b.g. dotting the desert landscape.
25.

ARIEL (VO) (CONT'D)
We learned hate is a disease that
corrupts the mind and rots the
soul. He told us about a weird and
evil concept called war, and shared
that violence was no way of
expressing one's point of view.

As they hammer away Ariel glances to her side. She catches the
eye of Duke, who smiles and quickly turns his head. She smiles,
coyly. They continue working. Young Albert comes up behind Duke
and teases him.

ALBERT AT 9
Du-u-ke's in love. Du-u-ke's in
love.

Duke swings around embarrassed and angry.

DUKE AT 9
I am not!

ALBERT
Yes you are. Yes you are. Yes you

Duke tackles Albert to the ground and the two fight like alley
cats. The other kids edging them on. Cornelius rushes over and
breaks up the fight and scolds them both.

NIGHT BLANKETS THE DESERT...Cornelius once again reads from the
wonderful books of history. A campfire illuminates his face as he

other HUMANS. Ariel sits close to Duke. They tease each other

ground. Duke and Cornelius obviously disagree on this concept.

ARIEL (VO) (CONT'D)
Duke had a will of his own and
often argued with Cornelius about

Corneliusâ mind-over-muscle speech
a million times, he still wanted to
learn how to defend himself.

the Empire of the Apes. And we knew

THE DESERT AT GOLDEN HOUR...

Duke and Ariel are horseracing with each other. They move in SLOW
MOTION. The muscles of the horses ripple. For the first time we
see them as young adults. They ride bareback. Gracefully
gallopping through space.

Duke takes the lead. Ariel gains fast. Looking over his shoulder,
Ariel laughs as she passes him up. She wins. The SLOW MOTION
resumes to normal speed as they jump from their horses. Duke
kicks a rock. He is visibly upset. Yet again Ariel outdoes him.

ARIEL
(laughing)
What's the matter Duke? You
getting too old?

DUKE
That's it!

Duke takes out after Ariel. A playful chase ensues. She giggles
as dust kicks up from their heels. He lunges at her, tackling
her to the ground. As they wrestle around they laugh. Duke pins
Ariel down. They're out of breath and stare into each other's
eyes. Then their smiles fade almost as if they are seeing each
other for the first time. They stare for a long moment. Suddenly
the spell is broken by a voice. It is Duke's best friend
CHARLIE, young and rougishly handsome.

CHARLIE
Duke, Ariel, come quickly.

Duke and Ariel jump to their feet ignoring that their "moment"
occurred. Charlie stands in the sand calling to them.
27.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Duke, Ariel, it's ready. It's
ready. Come on.

Duke and Ariel catch up with Charlie as the three of them run off
together.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE the humans gather to watch the
birth of their new irrigation system. Although it looks very
primitive it will do the trick in watering their small but
valuable crops.

Cornelius, now white haired, stands at a rudimentary looking pump
that sticks out of the sand. Next to him stands GEORGE. We
recognize George as the teacher from 20 years ago. Now older and
wiser.

CORNELIUS
My friends, no longer will we have
to hope for rain to keep our crops
alive. With this...

Duke, Ariel, and Charlie come running over the ridge.

DUKE, ARIEL, CHARLIE
Wait. Wait for us.

CORNELIUS
Well, it's about time.

The three join the group. Charlie runs to stand with his
girlfriend, DARA. They kiss. Duke and Ariel watch the affection.
They glance at each other, then quickly look away.

CORNELIUS
with this amazing invention it will
rain on our crops when we want it
to. Since George here invented
this wonder, I feel it only natural
that George, you, should do the
honors.

GEORGE
Thank you Cornelius.

George starts to pump. Everyone stares with anticipation. George
pumps vigorousy but no water comes out. Suddenly sand pours from
the spout. George seems dumbfounded.

DUKE
Do it harder George.

George is already out of breath. Everybody looks very
disappointed.
28,

GEORGE
I don't understand what went wrong.

DUKE
Come on Charlie.

Duke and Charlie step forward to volunteer their services. They
both take hold of the lever and pump with all their might. Then,
an ever-so-small drop of water trickles from the opening followed
by...SPLASH, a stream of water rushes out of the spout.

Everyone applauds and cheers. Several of the excited humans
follow the water. They run along the wooden troughs as the water
flows to the garden. Furrows in the ground along side the newly
planted seeds Â£111 with water.

Charlie and Dara embrace. Duke grabs Ariel and spins her around.
They are basking in an emotional moment of friendship, a
friendship that is evolving. All the humans are hugging each
other and rejoicing.

INT. UNDERGROUND SUBWAY - DAY

Time has expanded the archeological wonder. Handmade shelves with
a countless array of artifacts line the main room of the subway
station. They are all labeled and categorized. Years of
excavation have resulted in elaborately dug tunnels. Work CREWS
are assigned to various positions: The EXCAVATORS dig tunnels and
find artifacts in the soil and rock. The artifact CLEANING AND
RESTORING CREW carefully brush the dirt from every nook and
cranny of an artifact. They use hand-made brushes of horsehair
tied to the ends of sticks and spoon, etc. The LABELING AND
CATEGORIZING TEAM, led by Cornelius, try to figure out what the
artifacts are and how they were used.

ALBERT and JONAS, two friends of Duke, come running to Cornelius
with a newly found item. We recogize it as a barber shop pole.
They don't know what the hell it is.

JONAS
Cornelius quickly.

ALBERT
It's heavy.

CORNELIUS

(rushing to

help)
Heavens, that's fascinating. Put it
down gently now.

(pondering)
Most unusual. For what purpose
could this item have possibly
served man?
29.

ALBERT
Could be an old weird kinda tree.
JONAS
A tree? Maybe you hit a ball with
it?
CORNELIUS
I wonder.

A WHOLE CREW OF YOUNG HUMANS are digging through a wall. On the
team are Duke, Charlie, and Ariel. Ariel is at one end while
Charlie and Duke dig at the other end. Every few seconds Duke
stops digging and stares at Ariel. Everytime Ariel looks in
Duke's direction he quickly starts to excavate. Charlie watches
him for a while then starts to chuckle.

CHARLIE
I know that look.
DUKE
What look?
CHARLIE
That look you're always looking at
Ariel with.
DUKE

I don't know what you're talking
about. I'm not giving her any look.

CHARLIE
Why fight it. You're falling in
love. Dara and I are in love. It's
great.

DUKE
Falling in love with Ariel? She's
like my sister.

CHARLIE
Brothers don't look at sisters the
way you look at Ariel.

At that moment they break through a portion of the wall behind
which {s an open space.

DUKE
Charlie, look at this.

Duke and Charlie feverishly dig the rest of the dirt away from
the opening with their hands. Duke pushes his way through it and
stumbles. He falls forward landing flat on the ground. Duke looks
up and ds_h ce w a_ske Duke screams.
Everybody runs to see what has happened. They are all concerned,
except Charlie, who is laughing. Ariel smiles at Duke's
baffoonery. Duke starts to laugh as well. Cornelius comes running
over to see what has happened.
30,

CORNELIUS
What's wrong? What's wrong? I heard
a scream.

ARIEL

It's nothing Cornelius. Duke just
made a new friend, that's all.

Cornelius grabs a lantern and walks through the opening. He lifts
it above his head. The darkness illuminates to reveal...a cave-
like cavity in which rests a perfectly perserved portion of...

A NEW YORK CITY STREET...

Cornelius and Duke gasp, their eyes wide as saucers. This little,
vacuum-packed, underground air bubble has frozen in time. Covered
with stalagtites and stalagmites, but still intact are the
bottoms of some buildings. There are cars, streetlamps, and an
old corner newsstand.

Everyone walks through the opening to see. Amazing.

ARIEL
What is it?
CORNELIUS
(overcome )
History.

They all walk onto the street and breathe 2000 year old air.
CEREMONIAL MUSIC AUDIO BRIDGES

THE CROPS are beginning to grow. It is springtime in the
Forbidden Zone. The music fills the air. It is coming froma
short distance away where a wedding is in progress. Everyone is
in attendance.

IT IS THE GOLDEN HOUR

A SMALL BAND OF THREE HUMANS play the music with very rudimentary
instruments they fashioned out of other objects from underground.
Cornelius is conducting the ceremonious union of Charlie and
Dara. She wears a wreath of flowers in her hair. Duke and Ariel
have a hard time keeping their eyes off of each other as this
occasion is stirring up feelings inside of them.

CORNELIUS
And so you go forth living and
loving as one. May you have many
children. May you always be happy.
You may now embrace your mate as a
symbol of your togetherness
forever.

Charlie and Dara hug and kiss as everybody cheers.
CUT TO

DANCING, MUSIC, MERRIMENT. This small section of desert is alive
with happiness and joy. Everyone dances in a big circle holding
hands. The bride and groom dance in the center. The custom is
for only one couple to be in the middle at a time. Cornelius

jumps into the center and cuts in. Charlie joins the circle as
Cornelius dances with Dara. Then Albert breaks in and dances

with Cornelius as Dara joins the circle. Ariel enters to dance

with Cornelius.

Then it's Duke's turn. Cornelius rejoins the circle as Duke and
Ariel spin in each other's arms.

Duke and Ariel gaze into each other's eyes as the music grows
distant. The dancers around them become a blur. Like two
magnets their lips are drawn together. They kiss. Wind blows
their hair as they swirl round and round.

The wind grows stronger in force and blows sand in their faces.
Their trance is broken when they hear the others start to shout.

GEORGE
Sandstorm! Sandstorm! Everybody

Duke and Ariel look around nervously. Everyone is running in all
directions. Huge spirals of sand are whipping across the desert.

CORNELIUS
(balancing
against the
wind)
Oh dear. Oh dear. Don't panic.
Don't panic. Everyone knows what to
do.

The adornments of the wedding swirl like toothpicks in the wind.
Confusion abounds as shacks the humans built are being blown away
as if they were made of paper. The current of sand is blinding.
It 1s hard to keep one's footing. Struggling against the
torrents, the humans try to help each other toward shelter. A
small CHILD blows uncontrollably in the wind past Duke and Ariel.
Duke runs off to grab her. He swoops the child up in his arms.
When he turns in the blinding storm to see if Ariel is with him,
she is gone.

DUKE

the panic)
Ariel! Ariel!

Albert suns past Duke and grabs a hold of him, the wind and sand
beating mercilessly at then.

ALBERT
Come on! We must get underground.

DUKE
Where's Ariel?

ALBERT

Duke hands the child to Albert.

Albert drags the screaming Duke through the blankets of sand.

INT. UNDERGROUND SUBWAY - SAME TIME

Most of the humans are crowded underground as a few still
scramble into safety. There is alot of confusion. Everyone is
dissheveled from the storm. Duke struggles to get back outside.
He is so frantic he doesn't listen to what anyone has to say.

DUKE

Albert and Cornelius are holding him back.

DUKE

Let go of me.

CHARLIE
Calm down Duke...

DUKE

Out of sheer anguish and panic Duke spins around and slugs Albert
in the jaw. As Albert hits the ground, Duke sees ariel standing
behind Albert. She smirks and goes up to him. She puts her arms
around him. They hug and kiss passionately. Albert manages to
get to his feet. He brushes himself off and stands next to
Cornelius, who is smiling at the sight of Duke and Ariel.

lovers)

built are leveled. The crops are gone. The water pump is
unearthed and mangled.

debris. One by one they all begin to pick things up and make some
sense out of the destruction. It is human nature to rebuild.

matter?

Duke picks up an old "Time" Magazine. On the cover it reads: BON
VOYAGE TAYLOR: The picture is of Taylor waving good-by from the
doorway of his spaceship.

DUKE

to speak Ariel steps into the room. She has been listening
unnoticed from the doorway.

Duke and Cornelius are surprised by her presence.

You lied to me!

CORNELIUS

I was only trying to protect you.

DUKE
Protect me? Then why didn't you
tell me my father was hung by an
ape? You covered up the truth!
All these years some stupid story
about an accident. You should have
told me.

CORNELIUS
Perhaps I should have. I apologize.
How I apologize.

DUKE

You were just trying to protect
your own kind.

ARIEL
Duke!

CORNELIUS
The last ape I would ever protect

DUKE

Didn't you think I had a right to
know?

ARIEL
Of course he did! That's why he
just told you.

What difference does it make now?
It's been so many years.

Duke snatches his gun off the ground.

DUKE
This Izan is going to pay!

ARIEL
Quit talking stupid!

CORNELIUS
I'm sorry, Duke. I just never knew
how to tell you before. I wasn't
roud of what apes did to your

answer.

ARIEL
Yeah, what are you grying to do,
get yourself killed? 1 don't want
to lose you.

I love you.

Hearing those words stops Duke in his tracks. He looks at Ariel.

They hug.

A shaft of blue moonlight cascades across Duke and Ariel as they

EXT. LONESOME DESERT/DUKE'S DREAM - DAY

The picture is bright and the colors are pale and washed out. A
lonely wind carries sand across the dunes. For as far as the eye
can see there is nothingness. Suddenly in SLOW MOTION a horse
breaks through a cloud of dust. Atop the stallion rides Taylor.
Around his neck dangles a noose. Taylor rides up to Duke who is
standing in the desert. Taylor looks down at Duke and smiles. He
holds out his hand.

TAYLOR
My son.

Duke looks up and smiles like a child.

DUKE
Father.

Duke takes Taylor's hand and Taylor hoists Duke onto the back of
the horse. Duke moves to hug his father but he realizes he is on
the horse alone. Taylor is gone. Duke looks around. Nothingness.

WE PULL BACK to reveal Duke sitting on the horse in the middle of

Duke stares at her for a moment as 1f to shake the dream from his
mind.
DUKE

I dreamt about my father. He

Duke and Ariel hug. Duke's eyes well up with tears.

DUKE (CONT'D)

ARIEL
Don't torture yourself. I'm sure
Cornelius is right. The ape
civilization is probably dead and

They embrace harder.

CUT TO

EXT. IZAN SQUARE - DAY

Monstrous throngs of cheering APES span as far as the eye can
see. An ocean of waving flags. Of hairy faces. Heavy, pounding,
marching anthems pulsate explosively. The IZAN NATIONAL MILITARY
ORCHESTRA hammers endlessly.

Twenty years under the iron fist of a maniacal dictator has
changed the look of Ape Square dramatically. Not only has it been

renamed Izan Square, but all the immense marble pillars from the
past are gone and relaced with giant black marble sculptures of

Tzan, himself.
A PARADE...

Â«.-gxander and with more spectacle than has ever been seen is in
progress.
40.

Thousands of tramping boots march in perfect cadence. The gorilla
ARMY is a marvel to behold. With their distinctive military
posture they advance through the center of Izan Square. Devil's
eyes and snarling teeth. With a sharp glance to the right, the
soldiers hail their leader, who glares from the...

REVIEWING STAND...

Still a place of honor. Draped with banners and flags bearing
Izan's likeness, it looms over the parade like a storm cloud. The
stand is packed with GUARDS, ADVISORS, COMMANDERS, and other
GORILLAS of political importance. Riâ¬ies everywhere. Directly in
the center, larger-than-life, stands the ominous...

IZAN...

Older. More menacing. The vastness of this parade is a
testimony to his intimidation over the Empire. He waves to the
passing display. At his side stands the now-grown PAX, eyes as
cold as ice and a heart as black as coal. Pax 1s cool calculating
evil. It {ts obvious at first glance that Pax's gorilla upbringing
has molded him into the image of Izan, but even worse. Like his
stepfather, he 1s ruthless. Like a chimpanzee, he is intelligent.
A deadly combination!

This father-son duo has the Empire of the Apes in a vice-grip
choke hold that smothers its populace into submission at a whim!

THE PARADE ROLLS ON. Everything is larger than life! A caricature
of a power parade that rivals the grandure of Russia's Red Square
milleniums ago. The foot soldiers are followed by...

A FORMATION OF THE GOVERNMENTS FLEET OF MOTORIZED VEHICLES.
Issued by the government, for the government. These rolling
Menaces, quite simplictic by our standards, are threatening to
the ape population. Twenty years of rennovation have created a
Spectacle of mobile oppression. The storm of thelr motors sounds
like grinding bones.

GORILLA GUARDS ON HORSEBACK patrol the cheering masses. Any ape
not waving a flag and cheering is jabbed with a sharp poker. This

GIANT FLAGS...

...One hundred feet high bearing the ferocious likeness of Izan
slap in the wind. The gorilla FLAG CORPS is never out of
synchronization as they guide the enormous symbols along the
parade route.

NOW THE BOMBS...

Countless human SLAVES sweat and struggle to pull giant rolling
wooden catapults carrying huge bombs. It 1s apparent that most of
the money from the society is spent on the bombs themselves, as
the catapults that launch them are still quite primitive in
design and look.
41.

Izan especially loves this part. These bombs represent the
superior war power Izan has rought upon the civilization. Gorilla
guards on massive black horses ride along side the slaves
whipping them mercilessly.

GORILLA GUARD ON HORSEBACK
Heave! Heave! Move along! Move
along! Heave!!

The exertion exhausts some slaves to death. A SLAVE drops.
Thousands of feet trample his body. His corpse finally crushed by
a gigantic wheel from a catapult cart.

ANOTHER GUARD ON HORSEBACK

(whipping
slaves)
Heave you sons 0' bitches!! Heave!!

The awe of the parade is mindboggling.

Cornelius was wrong. Izan and his evil Ape Empire are stronger
than ever.

MEANWHILE...
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE APE CITY - SAME TIME

The streets are deserted. Everyape its at the parade. The music
and hoopla from Izan Square reverberates through all corners of

the city.

Everywhere one looks, pictures and posters of Izan can be seen.
His fearsome likeness snarls down at the public warnings its
citizens that, "IZAN CAN HEAR YOU!" No ape who loves breathing
dares to wag a loose tongue.

A GROUP OF HUMAN SLAVES wait quietly in their cage. Most sleep.
Some sit and stare. A lone gorilla GUARD paces back and forth,
bored. He sure wishes he was at the parade. Suddenly...

WHACK! A club comes down on the back of his head, knocking him
unconscious. The guard falls backward into the arms of a
chimpanzee named LIAM. As Liam ties, gags, and blindfolds the
guard, two other chimpanzees appear. They are ORPHEUS and WYNORA.

Wynora has long silky hair and is quite beautiful for a chimp.
She is the leader of the Simiantarian Liberation Movement, a
small underground group of chimps against opression.

Wynora busts open the lock on the cage of human slaves. They all
jump to their feet and cower in a huddle at the rear of the bars.
Through Wynora's convincing gestures the slaves eventually follow

her out of the pen.

WYNORA
(whispering
firmly)
Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!
42.

Wynora, Liam, and Orpheus are constantly on the look-out. Liam
and Orpheus throw the gorilla guard into the cage and lock it.

LIAM
(to unconscious
gorilla)
Sweet dreams goon.

The three chimps herd the humans down an alleyway and over to a
open manhole cover. One by one they all jump in. Orpheus jumps in
last. He pulls the cover over the hole, leaving the street as it

was.

In the cage the guard moans.

The carnival from the parade clamors through the streets.

INT. UNDERGROUND APE SEWER SYSTEM - SAME TIME

Humans and chimps race through ankle deep dirty water. Pounding
from the parade echoes through the narrow cave-like walls. Wynora
eads.

Faster and faster they run. Street level grids and manholes are
thelr only light. The frenzied sounds reverberating from the
parade grow louder and louder. Adrenalin pumps. Their pace
quickens.

The cheering and music reach a deafening decible. Wynora stops
momentarily and peers up through a grid. ie parade is passing
directly overhead. Dirt from the sewer walls showers them as the
massiveness o fe event shakes the ground.

EXT. IZAN SQUARE - SAME TIME

The power parade is endless as it barrels through Izan Square.
Amongst such a spectacle it is hard to detect Wynora as she peers
out from under the curb. However, a gorilla GUARD'S attention is
caught by movement from the grid. He steps to the curb and
suspiciously looks in.

INT. SEWER SYSTEM - SAME TIME

Like lightening Wynora and her group take off before the gorilla
can get a clear picture. Being the fiend that he is, the gorilla
pokes his machine gun through the grating. He randomly fires.
Bullets ricochet oft the stone walls like ping pong balls.

EXT. IZAN SQUARE - SAME TIME
The guard continues to casually riddle bullets into the sewer.

You can barely hear the gunshots for the thundering parade
sounds.
43.

Content, he walks back into the crowd.

INT. SEWER SYSTEM - SAME TIME

Scrambling through the tunnel system, Wynora's group traces
towards freedom. One UNLUCKY SLAVE floats dead from the gorilla's

bullet.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME

One by one the freed slaves jump from the huge circular drain
Pipe that jets out of the rock. Wynora, Liam, and Orpheus help
them as they leap to the ground.

WYNORA
(gesturing with
a wave)
Hurry. Run. Run. You're free.
You're free!

The humans race toward the desert never looking back. Wynora,
Liam, and Orpheus smile. A job well done.

A CHIMP FIST KNOCKING ON A BLACK WOODEN DOOR

A voice from the other side quips...

Monkey business.

A secret code. It is safe. The door unbolts and opens. There
stands MILES, another Simiantarian. Wynora, Liam, and Orpheus all
enter the dark room. We are in...

INT. SIMIANTARIAN HIDEOUT - DAY

A disgusting, little, black room reminiscent of a war torn
bunker. Being a Simiantarian is very dangerous under [zanian
rule. They are forced into hiding, fighting their righteous
causes in secret. Anyone caught acting or speaking out against
TIzan or his government is publicly executed.

Crowded into the scanty room are Wynora, Liam, Orpheus, Miles,

EXT. THE GALLOWS IN THE APE CITY - SUNSET

A line of PRISONERS, gorillas, chimps, and humans alike wait
shackled together at the base of the gallows. This daily
occurrence symbolizes the oppression rampant under Izanian
government. gorilla GUARD leads them one at a time to the
noose. Everything is very formal. As the HENCHAPE tightens the

rope around each neck, a gorilla SENTRY reads aloud the crime.

Two gorilla WORKERS take a DEAD GORILLA GUARD from the noose.
They toss his carcass onto a huge cart heaping with other
corpses.

A sparce crowd of ONLOOKERS is always on hand for public
hangings. The curious ones and the weeping relatives.

SENTRY
Next!

A PATHETIC GORILLA is led to the rope.

SENTRY (CONT'D)
(reading froma

The State accuses you of speaking
out against the Izanian Government.
How do you plead?

PATHETIC GORILLA
Not guilty!

SENTRY

General Izan and declare you guilty

With that the henchape pulls the lever. CRACK! The pathetic
gorilla's neck breaks.

SENTRY
Next!

In a single move the two workers throw the corpse on the cart.
The guard leads a CHIMPANZEE to the gallows.

CHIMPANZEE
(screaming for
mercy)
No please...please. I'm innocent!
Don't kill me. Please.

His neck goes in the noose.

SENTRY
The State accuses you of defacing a
public poster of our Supreme
General Izan. How do you plead?

Yank! Crack! Dead! The Sentry looks at his watch.

SENTRY
Okay. That's it for today.

The last body is always left to hang. Everybody packs up to go
home.

A gorilla guard leads tomorrow's prisoners back to their cells.

GUARD

chimp)
You were lucky today, but tomorrow

A group of human SLAVES pulls the cart of corpses away.
The last hanging ape of the day sways back and forth. He's a
ghastly token of Izan's tyranny.

AN EXOTIC DANCING GORILLA APE-ETTE girates and wiggles to the

Her finger symbols clink rhythmically. She and five other
BEAUTIES dance, tantilizing the ravenous APES who gorge
themselves at...

INT. IZAN'S BANQUET TABLE - NIGHT

The evening feast 1s underway in Izan's opulent banquet room. The
walls are decorated with trophies, oil paintings of Izan, and
human skin rugs.

Izan and Pax sit at the head of an enormous table heaping with
mountains of food. Jugs of wine flow like rivers.

All of Izan's GENERALS, COMMANDERS, ADVISORS, AND BODYGUARDS glut
to their heart's content.

A small group of CHIMPANZEE MINSTRELS provide the music for the
dancing ape-ettes.
49,

Interspersed amongst the males are LADY GORILLAS-OF-THE-EVENING
sitting on their laps. Feeding them grapes and bananas. and
giggling in thelr ears.

HUMAN SLAVES run back and forth from the kitchen bringing more

food and drink. This is the epitome of Izanian decadence.

The festivity is loud, however Izan's voice rings the loudest.
When he is drunk he becomes one obnoxious gorilla.

IZAN
(jumping up)
A toast to my son Pax!
(slaps Pax on
the back)
One day this will all be yours!

All the gorillas raise their mugs and cheer.

IZAN (CONT'D)
I'm sure everybody here remembers
that fateful night about 20 years
ago when I found Pax in that
garbage sack.

All the gorillas acknowledge Izan's "tale" as if it were true.
All much too fearful of Izan to do anything else.

IZAN (CONT'D)

I killed that son of a bitch father
of yours on charges of cruel and
unsimian treatment of a minor.

(a boom of

laughter)
And if that's not the best damn
thing I ever did for myself and my
Empire, I don't know what is!

An uproarious hooray bellows from the apes. Pax and Izan bear
ug.

PAX
(holding up his
mug)
To my father...I never get tired of
that story. Everything I am I owe
to this gorilla.

Pax grabs Izan's giant head and kisses the pointed top.
Everyape hollers and bangs the table.

mug)

ANOTHER GORILLA

Long live Izan.

Izan snaps his fingers at one of the female apes who sits on
another gorilla's lap.

IZAN
Hey, ape-ette, get over here and
keep my son warm.

The APE-ETTE giggles and prances over to Pax. She sits on his lap
and starts to feed him julcy berries one by one. She suckles his
ear lobe.

Izan stands again. Without stopping he guzzles an entire jug of
wine. BELCH!

IZAN (CONT'D)
Some entertainment would be
appropriate about now. I need my
goofy gorilla.
(shouts out)
Send in my fool.

GORILLA COMMANDER
(jumping to his
feet)
The General wants his fool. Where
ts his fool?

The minstrels start to play a silly troubador tune.

A gorilla (FOOL) dressed in an absurd looking costume dances in.
He carries a staff with a miniature scupture of his face on the
op.

IZAN
Ah, my fool. Entertain us you
iafot.

FOOL
(in a high
pitched goofy
voice)
My pleasure your ugliness.

The fool bows. Izan and all the apes explode into hysterical
laughter. They love this guy.

FOOL (CONT'D)
For my first trick...
Sl.

The fool then lets himself fall straight backwards like a board.
The apes howl with delight. Then miraculously the fool springs
back up onto his feet. He bows.

ALL APES
More...More!

The fool does a little dance, then continues.

FOOL
How do you save a human from
drowning?

IZAN
(laughing)
How?

FOOL
Shoot him.

As the gorillas go ape with that punchline, the fool jumps
straight up in the air and lands flat on his butt with a loud
HONK.

Then the fool takes a banana out of his pocket. Slowly and
methodically he peels it and takes a bite. Suddenly the fool
screams.

FOOL
Ouch!

We see that inside the peel there isn't a banana at all, but the
fool's thumb painted yellow. Everybody howls. It doesn't take
much to make these apes laugh.

The fool takes off his hat to bow. He bends at the waist in grand
style. The top of his head is shaved. On the bald dome is
painted in big letters: IZAN SMELLS. This is the only guy in the
entire Empire who can get away with insulting Izan. Izan holds
his sides as he belly laughs.

The fool jumps onto the table and does an amusing little jig. The
apes love it. He cackles wildly and holds his staff above his
head. He pulls a ring at the end of the staff causing the little
head to explode. Show etti rain down on 1_the apes.

Sport be without its favorite food.

VENDOR
(hawking)
Bananas. Get your fresh ripe
bananas here. Bananas.

SUDDENLY a musical fanfare draws everyone's attention. Every ape
in the place jumps to their feet. All eyes watch as [zan and Pax
are carried in atop their litter, which is steadied on the
shoulders of four SLAVES.

The litter is lowered. Izan and Pax step off, wave to the
throngs, and take their seats in the General's box. Izan's
presence signals the start of the game.

A DOOR OPENS and 3 HUMAN SLAVES are thrown into the huge ring. A
raucus explosion of "B0O'S" rises from the spectators. The humans
stand scared and confused. They have nowhere to hide. Then...
57.

ONTO THE FIELD STEPS...

THE BIGGEST, MOST FEROCIOUS, MUTANT MONSTER OF A GORILLA EVER
SEEN (THE MACHINE)! The crowd goes wild. He is thelr hero.

The humans are in utter shock at the sight of The Machine. He
takes one lumbering step forward and they start darting like
rabbits.

The Machine takes off after one of the scattering slaves. His
snarling teeth drip with saliva. He snorts. He roars. The
tension mounts as he gains on the fleeing man. The Machine
lashes out. With his mammoth hand he grabs the human by the back
of his hair. With a quick jerk, he throws the slave through the
alr like a sack of potatoes. THUD. The human hits the ground
hard. The audience screams with delight. Blood bubbling from his
nose, the human curls up in pain.

APE IN CROWD
(at the top of
his lungs)
Kill him! Kill the son of a bitch!

ANOTHER APE IN CROWD
Come on! Tear him apart!!

The Machine lurches toward the wounded human. Suddenly...

One of the other slaves jumps on the Machine's back. His arms
tightly around the thick hairy neck, the human bites down on his
black ear. The Machine reaches to pull the pesky human off his
back, but can't get a good grip.

At full speed the Machine runs backward toward the stone wall.
SLAM. He crushes the human with amazing impact. The human
slides off his back, hitting the ground. The Machine grabs the
slave's ankles.

APE IN CROWD
(waving his
fist)
Atta way! Tear'm to shreds!

With a savage roar he picks up the battered human. WHACK. He
smashes the human against the wall like a baseball bat. Blood
flies. BAM. He whacks the body against the ground. Flesh
splits at the rib cage.

The audience is going wild.

with one more mighty BLOW, the Machine SLAMS the carcass against
the wall. The corpse breaks apart like a wet loaf of bread, and
sticks. Large chunks slowly drip off the stone.

The Machine turns. The blood-thirsty crowd edging him on.
58.

APE IN CROWD
Go, go, go, go!

The wounded human is on his feet once again. He tries to limp
away from the approaching killing monster. The Machine's shadow
engulfs him. His black hand grabs his white throat. The human's

eyes bulge like a fish.

The gorilla lifts him into the air by his neck. He pulls back
his other woolly hand, and with the force of a locomotive, he
punches the human in the face sending him flying backward twenty
eet.

Once is not enough.

The Machine stomps over to the mangled slave. He picks him up by
his broken neck, and SLAMS another knuckle sandwich into what's
left of his face. The limp body flies twenty feet farther.

The crowd is on their feet with insanity.

The Machine runs at top speed toward the bloodied slave. He
leaps through the alr. His big feet come hurtling down on the
human's skull. It CRUSHES like a ripe melon. Izan and Pax are
loving every minute.

The Machine pivots and stares directly at the third human slave.
The scrawny man shakes like a leaf.

As is the custom the last remaining victim is thrown a weapon. A
GUARD tosses him a long wooden stick. The human rushes for the
pole. The desperate slave, like a jouster, poises the pole
above his head and charges at The Machine. The Machine smirks.
Just when it appears the pole will stab into his massive chest...

With lightening speed the Machine grabs the end of the pole. He
hoists it over his head. The pole points straight up into the
alr.

Dangling on the top for dear life is the horrified slave. He
should have let go of that pole.

The crowd jumps and screams.

The Machine looks up at his prey and roars. Hand over hand he
slowly lowers the stick bringing the slave closer with each move.
There is no escape; The ape casts the pole aside and grabs the
slave into a headlock

The spectators are delirious.
Out of respect The Machine looks up to Izan for the finale.

Izan oucstretches his arm and points his big thumb to the side.
Will it be thumbs up or thumbs down? Every eye in the place
looks to Izan. There is a momentary silence. Izan grits his

teeth. Smiles. Thumbs down!
$9.

The audience goes crazy.

The Machine digs his fingers under the fleshy part of the slave's
chin. with his bare hands he TEARS the human's head clean off.
Blood squirts like a fountain. Then, he takes his huge black
hand and shoves it down the neck of the headless corpse. He
forces his arm all the way into the twitching torso. He yanks
his arm out and holds it skyward.

There, in the geriiia's balm, is the human's beating heart. He
heaves the heart into the middle of his cheering fans. They

scramble for it as lf it were a homerun basebal

The Machine bows to Izan and Pax. They are on their feet wildly
applauding the performance.

Izan beams, when unexpectedly...

WE SEE IZAN THROUGH THE POV of a telescopic rifle lens
viewfinder. The crosshairs find their way to Izan's chest.

BACK IN THE BOOTH Izan waves and cheers vigorously.

SUDDENLY...BANG. A SHOT RINGS OUT. A bullet explodes into Izan's
shoulder. He clutches his arm and doubles over. The spectators

are shocked.

PAX
(horrified)
Father!!

GUARDS rush to Izan's aid, feverishly looking for the sniper.

GUARD
(shouts to
other guards)
Where did that shot come from?

BANG. Another shot. Everybody ducks. The bullet ricochets off
the stone bleachers next to Izan. Chaos takes over.

PAX
(screaming)
Do something dammit!! Do
something!!

Blood gushes through Izan's fingers.

BODYGUARD
{holding Izan,
shrieks)
Let's get him out of here!!

ANOTHER BODYGUARD
(shoving apes
out of the way)
Move it!
60.

Other guards have their guns pointed in all different directions
looking for the assassin.

ANOTHER GUARD
(shouting
loudly into
crowd)
Show your face you bastard!

Suddenly an APE from the crowd cries out and points skyward...

APE IN CROWD
There he is!t

All eyes dart to the direction the ape is pointing. High above
the arena, perched on the shoulder of a statue of Izan ls...

OUKE. His rifle aimed at Izan.

PAX
It's a human!!

APE IN BLEACHERS
(screams)
Get him!

Duke looks up from his gun in a panic. He's been spotted. All
the apes turn their weapons up to Duke and open fire. Bullets
riddle the mighty statue. Duke's rifle drops. It hits the
ground far below.

A bunch of apes are racing toward him from all sides. Left with
only one option...

Duke slides down the back of the sculpture at a Lightening speed.
He grits his teeth and clutches the smooth marble for dear life
as he chutes down.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE ARENA - SAME TIME

Duke hits the ground with a THUD. Without a moment to think he
jumps to his feet and takes off.

Gorilla guards pour out of the arena doors like floodwater. They
Spot Duke. BLAM. They shoot. He disappears around a corner.
The gorillas won't let him get away.

It's a race for Duke's life!

NARROW ALLEYWAY

Duke tears down the wet cobblestones at lightening speed. The
guards hot on his heels.
61.

BANG. BANG. BANG. Bullets fly frighteningly close to his head.
He knocks over garbage barrels to block their way. Trash flies
everywhere. Some guards leap over the barrels. Others trip and

fall. Duke panicks.
It's a dead end.
He dodges left into a doorway.

APE CAFE KITCHEN...

Duke busts into a busy ape cafe kitchen. The COOKS AND WAITERS
are shocked. A human.

APE COOK
What is the meaning of this?

Without a second to spare the gorilla guards barge into the
kitchen shooting.

A COOK goes tumbling.

GUARD
Outta my way!

Bullets PING off the walls. Duke jumps through the door leading
to the eating room.

IN THE EATING ROOM...

The force of the door knocks a WAITER backwards. His tray of
dishes flies everywhere. SMASH. CRASH.

The APE CUSTOMERS scream as Duke plays dodge âem around the
tables.

APE CUSTOMER #1
It's a human!

APE CUSTOMER #2
What the hell's going on?

Guards tear through the eating room like a tornado. Bullets
ricochet. Tables overturn. Customers duck for cover.

puke leaps out of the door just as a barrage of gunfire misses
nm.

BUSY CITY STREET...

The street is teeming with activity. Duke pushes his way through
the mass of APES.

The street bazaar VENDORS and their carts act as an obstacle
course.
62

Mayhem and madness take over as Duke and his pursuers wreak havoc
throughout the bustling street. Carts fly left and right.
Bullets meant for Duke hit innocent bystanders, killing them. He
runs with all his might through the throngs.

Racing at a fevered pace Duke plows through a group of slaves who
are hoisting the giant marble hea zan into the air and onto

its headless body.

Duke knocks the rope right out of their hands. They fall in all
directions. The massive head plummets downward just as the
guards are passing beneath it. SLAM. The statue head SMASHES
DOWN on a handful of guards pulverizing them like bugs.

There's no time to stop: The surviving guards charge after Duke.
Duke sprints for dear life. He hears the gunfire behind him, but

he's moving too fast to look back.

SPOTTING AN OPEN AIR SLAVE TRANSPORTING VEHICLE filled with human
slaves, Duke leaps into the back hoping to seek camouflage
amongst the other humans.

The guards speed to catch the truck.

GUARD
(bellowing)
Stop that transport! Stop that
transport!

The vehicle jerks to a halt.

Duke sits amidst the load of slaves hopeful the gorillas will not
be able to tell him from the others. The guards rush to the
back.

GUARD
Which one is he?

ANOTHER GUARD
I can't tell one from the next.

A THIRD GUARD
They all look alike.

With that, the gorilla guards start shooting all the slaves...One
by one. It's mindless butchery.

Duke thinks fast. Just as he is about to be shot, Duke leaps
away from the slaves and onto the roof of the vehicle. The
bullet meant for him kills another. He jumps onto the hood.
Then down onto the street. He races through the crow.

Suddenly, Duke's eyes bulge.
Shoving their way through the crowd, heading straight for him,

another group of GORILLA GUARDS. Ouke turns. Runs. He leaps
back onto the hood of the slave vehicle and up onto its roof.
63.

He 1s trapped. Gorillas are coming at him from all angles,
surrounding the vehicle. Could this be curtains?

Duke jumps straight upward. He grabs hold of a sign jetting out
of a storefront. It reads: TAXIDERMY STUFFED HUMANS AT
REASONABLE RATES. With all his might he pulls himself up and
springs onto the store's rooftop, just as the sign is pulverized
with bullets.

Duke speeds across the rooftop. The gorillas run along the
sidewalk never letting him out of their sight. They shoot up at
him, but can't get a clear shot.

Duke is nearing the edge of the building. He picks up speed and
leaps from one rooftop to the next. He hurdles from rooftop to
rooftop across the ape skyline. Suddenly, there are no more
rooftops left.

Stiff with fear he looks down over the edge. The gorilla guards
are converging at the bottom of the building.

Thinking fast Duke sees a government issued garbage wagon passing
the building on its way out of town. It is piled high with
rubbish. This is his ticket out. He takes a running start and
flies headlong for the safety of the trash. Ouke hurls through

space.
SUDDENLY...A NET!

The garbage wagon drives away.

Duke is left dangling in mid-air. Caught like a fish.

All the apes circle around him, guns cocked. A CROWD OF
SPECTATOR APES GATHER. Among them Wynora and Wingding.

GUARD #1
(jabbing his
gun into Duke's
ribs)
Think you're mighty smart, don't
you?

GUARD #2
Look at this human's eyes. I'd
swear he's almost thinking.

GUARD #3
Let's pulverize the hell outta this
one.

GUARD #1

with pleasure.

All the gorilla guards take aim. Suddenly Izan's voice booms
out.
64.

IZAN (OS)
wait!

The crowd makes a path for Izan's litter. Pax sits with his
father. A bloody bandage {ts wrapped around Izan's arm. Two
GUARDS on horseback escort the royal duo.

IZAN (CONT'D)
on't k ve!

Izan and Pax walk over to Duke. Izan takes a dagger from his
belt. He reaches through the net and grabs Duke's face. Izan
digs the blade tip into Duke's neck, just short of piercing the
skin. Duke struggles helplessly.

IZAN (CONT'D)
I want to cut this human's throat
myself.

PAX
Father don't!

IZAN
(angrily)
why?
PAX
You'll hurt your arm.

(coldly
I'll do it for you!

Izan grins. He passes the dagger to Pax.
IZAN
Of course, Pax.
(with steel
cruelty)
Make sure he feels the pain.
Pax grips Duke's hair.
In the crowd Wynora closes her eyes.

Just as Pax raises the blade...

DUKE

(screams)
G wi
damn stinking ape!

Pax drops the knife. Wynora's eyes shoot open. The crowd gasps.
Izan knows.

65,

INT. IZAN'S THRONE ROOM - LATER

A long extravagant room. Izan sits on his massive stone chair.
Next to him sits Pax on a smaller, yet impressive looking throne.
A gorilla PHYSICIAN is tending to Izan's arm. GUARDS line the
room standing at attention.

Two OTHER GUARDS drag a kicking and struggling Duke into the room
and throw him to the floor in front of Izan and Pax. Izan waves

his arm and dismisses his physician, who rushes out of the room,

Izan glares down at Duke for a long moment...

IZAN
There was once another human who
could Speak. His name was Taylor. I
killed him.

DUKE
I am Taylor's son!

IZAN
That would account for your
stupidity!

DUKE
My father was a great man!

IZAN
(amused)
There's no such thing as a great

man!...

DUKE
How would you know?

IZAN
Izan knows everything!

PAX
(curiously)
who's Taylor? Father, what's going
on

IZAN
(ignoring Pax)
I'll enjoy watching you suffer.

DUKE
If you're going to kill me why
don't you just get it over with?

IZAN
(laughs)
You'll die soon enough, but I want
to make certain your death is a
public celebration just like your
father's.

The guards seize Duke and are pulling him out of the room
screaming.
DUKE

He's your blood father Pax. He's
alive. He raised me.

IZAN
Lies! All lies! Tomorrow morning

Duke is dragged from the room. Izan turns to Pax, his gorilla
eyes red with rage.
IZAN (CONT'D)

Never, never believe what a
speaking human says.

Pax looks confused.

CUT TO

INT. DUNGEON CELL

A tiny dark room. The two guards throw Duke into the damp
hellhole.

DUKE
(struggling)
Take it easy, will you. You're
breaking my arm.

GUARD #1
Ah, shut-up.

GUARD #2
You're lucky we don't break your
head.
(surprised at
himself)
What the hell am I doing? I'm

talking to a human.

The guards laugh at the absurdity. SLAM. The heavy wooden door
closes.

DUKE
Let me outta this pit you animals!
You apes!!

The little viewing window on the door slides open and the guards
sneer in at Duke.

GUARD #1
You hear that Otto? A human calling
us animals.
68.

GUARD #2
Izan sure has plans for you, human.

They both cackle as the little viewing window slides closed.

Duke is alone...He knows the door is bolted, but he tries anyhow.
It's no use. Frustrated, he takes a running start and smacks his
shoulder against the door. It doesn't budge. Repeatedly Duke
pounds the door with his fists.

DUKE
(screaming)
Let me outta here! Damnit, let me

outta here!!
Over and over he bangs until he can't bang anymore.

He slumps against the door and slides to the dirt floor. Duke
hugs his knees. Maybe this revenge wasn't such a good idea after
all.

From a small barred window high above his head a thin shaft of
sunlight shines across Duke's tortured face.

TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE

Duke ts crouched in a corner of the cell. It is very still. The
slit of sunlight has turned orange. It is now sunset.

SUDDENLY...

Â«+-A nolse comes from the other side of the door. Duke perks up
nervously.

a key JIGGLES in the lock. The bolt CLINKS. Duke is immobile.
Then...

The door bursts open. Duke GASPS.

There in the doorway stands Pax. He steps into the cell SLAMMING
the door behind him. Duke stands to face him. Duke is nervous.
Pax's expression is without emotion.

PAX

You intrigue me speaking human.
DUKE

My name is Duke.
PAX

I don't care. I've never seen a
freak of nature before. What other
tricks do you do?
Pax slaps

69.

DUKE
You're the freak. A chimpanzee
raised to act and think like a
gorilla. Doesn't that go against
your natural grain?

Duke across the face.
PAX
(angry)
Why are you here?
DUKE

Revenge. My father spoke of peace,
and was slaughtered for it by Izan.

PAX
Well, it appears as though revenge
will have accomplished nothing but
a noose around your neck. Isn't
that right Duke

DUKE
After what Izan has done to
Cornelius I don't know why you
don't seek revenge against him.
(looking him in
the eye)

Cornelius is your father, you know.
PAX

There is no such ape as Cornelius.

You lie.

DUKE
Why would I lle? Listen to me,
you're real father lives in torture
to this day, wondering are you
alive? Are you dead? What are you
e

PAX
If you're going to speak, you
should at least know what you're
talking about. This storytelling is
laughable. I am the son of Izan. My
real father was killed for unsimian
treatment of a minor. Izan killed
him and adopted me. Everything I am
I owe to Izan.

DUKE
Izan 1s a maniac. Open your eyes to
the oppression around you.
Cornelius is a kind and gentle ape.

pain

PAX
(snap pping)
I don't believe a word you say.

DUKE
Then why are you here?

Pax turns to open the door and exit. He pauses. Without looking
back he asks...
PAX
Supposing what you say 1s true?
If my real father is alive, why has
he not come for all these years?

DUKE
I don't know.

Pax leaves and closes the door.

AUDIO BRIDGE TO

A FAT GORILLA WOMAN dressed like a Viking peasant hits a high
soprano note.

IT'S A NIGHT AT THE OPERA
On the grandious stage a full-blown ape opera is in progress.

The DIVA ts belting out her aria. You can see her tonsils vibrate
as she SHRILLS. She finishes and curtsies in operatic splendor.

The AUDIENCE applauds wildly. Scores of apes in formal wear jump
to their feet in a standing ovation.

Izan and Pax clap from their boxseats high above the audience.
The Diva blows a handful of kisses to her leaders.

The curtain closes. An easel supports a sign that reads ACT ONE.
An APE HAND reaches from the wings with a sign reading ACT Two.

The audience sits back down. There's more to come.

THE APE CONTUCTOR srikes up his ORCHESTRA as the curtain reopens.
The set is extravagant. The CHORUS sings loudly as the main
character, our HERO, makes a grand entrance. He is a dashing
gorilla General loved by his entire kingdom. The hero breaks
into a tenor solo. This is music to Izan's ears.

INT. DUKE'S DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT/SAME TIME

Duke has fallen asleep on the dirty cell floor. The door
suddenly opens. The light startles him awake. He jumps.

DUKE
(frightened)
Is it morning?!

In walks...Wynora. She has a rifle slung across her back and the
cell keys in her hand.

WYNORA
Don't be scared. I'm here to help
you.

DUKE
Who are you?

WYNORA

No time now. Quick. Come with me.

Duke and Wynora scurry out of the cell and down the...

DU! ON. Ws.

They run down the narrow torch-lit corridor keeping an eye peeled
for danger.

In a corner on the floor Liam and Orpheus are tying up the two
unconscious gorilla guards.

WYNORA
(to Liam and

Orpheus)
Good work. Now get the hell out of
here as fast as you can.

ORPHEUS
You bet.

LIAM
See you back at the hideout.

Wynora and Duke take off.

LIAM (CONT'D)
Be careful.

DUKE
(as they keep
moving)
Who are they?
WYNORA

Friends.
72.

BACK AT THE QPERA

The diva and the hero are in each other's arms singing of their
love for one another. Izan and Pax are engrossed.

N ON CORR R

Wynora and Duke round a corner and bound up a long flight of
stone stairs.

DUKE
(running)
what's your name?

WYNORA
Wynora. Now shut-up.

JUST AS THEY GET TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS we see Miles and
Wingding tying up two more unconscious GUARDS.

WYNORA (CONT'D)
Hurry up you two and make
yourselves scarce.

MILES
You got it.

WINGDING
Isn't this great?!

Wynora and Duke rush to the front doors. She peeks out. Her
horse is right where she left it. The coast is clear.

EXT. DUNGEON - NIGHT/SAME TIME

Wynora and Duke bust out of the doors and run to the horse. She
jumps on.

WYNORA
(hurried)
Come on. Get on.

Suddenly from around the corner a motorized government vehicle
filled with gorilla GUARDS spots Wynora and Duke's getaway.

GUARD @1
That's the talking humant

GUARD #2
She's stealing the slave!

The vehicle accelerates.

Duke runs to leaps on the back of the horse.
73.

WYNORA
Hold on tight!

DUKE
What?

The horse bolts away. Caught unaware the force flies Duke
backward off the saddle.

BACK Hi R

Exploding into a swell of electrifying song, the cast and chorus
sing out in a most riveting fashion.

THE EXCITING MUSIC AND LARGER-THAN-LIFE VOICES FROM THE OPERA ACT
AS THE SCORE FOR DUKE AND WYNORA ON THEIR HAIRRAISING ESCAPE.

THE HORSE FLIES DOWN THE ROAD. The gorilla guards in hot pursuit
arrel after them. Wynora yells back to Duke. She doesn't
realize he isn't there.

WYNORA
Hold onto my waist so you don't
fall off.

No response.

WYNORA (CONT'D)
Hey!
Wynora looks back to see nothing.

Duke's foot is caught in the stirrup. He is being dragged along
the ground. Duke desperately tries to pull himself back onto the
saddle, but the wind current holds him down.

DUKE
(yelling)
Give me your hand!

WYNORA
What the hell happened?!

DUKE
Just gimme your hand!

Wynora keeps an eye on the road. She holds the reins with one
hand and attempts to reach back for Duke with her other.

Duke struggles to grab hold of her. The intense speed makes it
hard to control the animal.

The gorilla vehicle chases after them. One of the guards reaches
over the windshield and takes aim.
14,

Duke strains with all his might and stomach muscles to lift
himself off of the ground. He stretches as far as he can to grab

Wynora's hand.
Just as the tips of their fingers touch...

BANG! A shot rings out and just misses Duke. Startled, Wynora
grabs the reins with both hands. Duke falls back again and

drags along the ground.

AT_THE OPERA

The bass drum POUNDS. The chorus sings feverishly. A whirlwind
of excitement.

ON _THE ROAD

Bullets ZING by Wynora and Duke. Duke is straining again for
Wynora's outstretched hand. Ahead Wynora sees another government
guard vehicle filled with gorilla guards. It is coming straight
towards them.

WYNORA
(frantic)
Hurry, grab my hand! Hurry!!

Duke reaches with all his might. Their finger tips touch.

The approaching vehicle is nearing fast. Bullets are WHI2ZZING
from both ends.

With an explosion of every bit of strength he has, Duke grabs
Wynora's hand tight. She pulls with all she can muster.

The vehicles are closing fast.

In a single, strong-armed, burst of might Duke is pulled upward
and onto the saddle. And not a moment too soon. At that instant
Wynora grabs the reins with both hands and jerks the horse's head
up. The stallion leaps into the air and in an amazing feat jumps
over the approaching vehicle.

The two vehicles SLAM on their breaks to avoid hitting head on.
Both spin out of control. CRASH. They SLAM into each other side
by side. A couple apes go flying onto the street.

Wynora's horse lands like a ballerina. She rears it and manuevers
the horse into a U-turn. Duke and Wynora gallop right past the
disheveled guards back in the direction they came.

GUARD #1
(screaming)
What the hell were you doing coming
straight for us?
78.

GUARD IN OTHER JEEP
(screams back)
What the hell do you think we were
doing?

GUARD #1
You nearly killed us.

The gorilla vehicles will not restart. They are not meant to take
such abuse.

Duke and Wynora fly like the wind. It appears as though they have
made a clean getaway. Suddenly two other military vehicles emerge
from a side road screaming after them. The chase is on again.

The two vehicles gain fast on Duke and Wynora. All the strength
Wynora's horse can muster cannot compete with the guard
transports. The two vehicles pull up on either side of Wynora's
racing steed. Duke and Wynora are horrified. In a quick sweeping
move a guard from one of the vehicles throws an arm around
tynozays neck and pulls her off of the speeding horse and into

e vehicle.

Duke, alone on the back of the horse, makes a move to jump onto
the vehicle to save Wynora. He grabs the window bar, but suddenly
another guard from the opposite vehicle grabs his foot.

The riderless horse is left behind as the two vehicles zoom
forward. Duke's body is a bridge between them. He is stretched to
his absolute physical limit. Guards from each vehicle grab for
Duke.

Duke's jaw drops in horror as the two vehicles are about to pass
on either side of a tree. Out of split second desperation Duke
takes his free foot and kicks the DRIVER in the eye, causing him
to let go of the wheel. Duke then kicks the steering wheel
veering the vehicle away.

He yanks himself onto the vehicle carrying Wynora just before the
tree would have knocked him in half. The other vehicle careens
out of control and crashes head on into the base of a marble
statue of Izan. BOOM.

Duke pulls himself into the vehicle just as Wynora heaves a guard
out of the back. The guard goes tumbling to the ground.

A hairraising fight insues as Duke and Wynora duel for their
lives with the remaining two guards. The vehicle is all over the
road. Strangling. Punching. Pummeling. Duke and Wynora heave
another guard out of the vehicle sending him rolling down an
embankment.

Duke and Wynora turn to finish off the driver, but stop cold. The
GORILLA DRIVER drives with one hand and points a gun at Duke and
Wynora with the other. Could this be it?
76.

THE OPERA Hl NS...

GORILLA DRIVER
Say your prayers.

Suddenly, Wynora GASPS. The driver is not paying attention to the
road as he drives head-on towards a restraining stone wall. He
mistakes Duke and Wynora's expressions as fear of his gun. Duke
and Wynora look at each other.

THE OPERA MUSIC REACHES [TS FRENZIED CRESCENDO...

Just before the driver pulls the trigger Duke and Wynora jump off
the back of the vehichle. In the same instant the driver pulls
the trigger and hits the wall full speed. The vehicle explodes.

SIMULTANEOUSLY...AT THE OPER

The giant cymbals CRASH together. The cast and chorus bow having
just finished their tumultuous finale. Uproarious applause. A
standing ovation. Izan claps wildly from his box.

Amidst the hoopla two GUARDS enter Izan's box and whisper
something to him. Whatever it is, it's gotten him instantly
furious. The two guards, Izan, and Pax rush out.

INT. SIMIANTARIAN HIDEOUT - SAME NIGHT

All the members are in attendence...Professor, Miles, Liam,
Orpheus: Wingding, and Wynora. Duke has their undivided
a en on.

DUKE
I just hope Cornelius will still
speak to me once I get back.

PROFESSOR
Who would blame him if he didn't.
What you did was foolish.

WYNORA
(tongue and
cheek)
I can't believe it. Even the humans
are talking about Cornelius.

WINGDING
(to Duke)
I think it's so exciting.

DUKE
What good did it do? I almost got
myself and all of you killed, and
for what? Izan is still walking
around. I failed.
77,

WYNORA
You didn't fail. Only by doing
nothing can we fail. You took a
chance and I admire that.

WINGDING
When are you gonna try again?
We'll help.

DUKE
(shakes his
head)
For now I'm going back home. But
who knows, I may be back.

PROFESSOR
I think going home and staying home
is a very wise idea.

DUKE
Why don't you all come back with
me? This Izan is making your life
here a living hell.

All the Simiantarians look at each other. There is a moment of
silence.

DUKE (CONT'D)
We live a great life in the
Forbidden Zone. I know you'll all
be welcome.

ORPHEUS
Tf we go with you there will be no
one left here to fight for what is
right.

DUKE
It's only a matter of time til your
all caught and hung.

MILES
We haven't been caught yet.

WYNORA
Besides this is our home. This is
all we know. We can't run away from

DUKE
But all you know is oppression, and
secret hideouts, and public
hangings. That's no way to live
e.
Professor

78,

LIAM
That's why we're trying to change
it.

DUKE

How can you change anything Lf
speaking your mind is grounds for
capital punishment?

WYNORA
(with
determination)
We don't speak out with our words.
There are other ways to be heard.

shakes his head in disapproval.

ORPHEUS
(with a twinkle
in his eyes)
An ape's gotta do what an ape's
gotta do.

A stillness falls over the room. Duke gets the message.

Wingding,

DUKE
I understand.
(smiles)
Well, 1â¬ you'll just point me in
the direction of home, I'11 be on

my way.
LIAM

No, you can't leave tonight.
DUKE

Why not?
WYNORA

The guards will have all the exits
from the city blocked off...The
sewers won't even be safe.
Tomorrow night will be better.

ORPHEUS
You'll be safe here.

Miles, and Orpheus get up to leave.

WINGDING
(to Duke)
If we don't see you before you
leave...good luck.

DUKE
(shaking thelr
hands)
Thanks...Thanks for everything.
79,

They cautiously exit the hidehout.

LIAM

(to Duke)
Are there a lot of humans living
free in the Forbidden Zone?

DUKE
Yes.

LIAM
I'm glad.

Liam and Duke shake hands.
LIAM (CONT'D)

See ya.
DUKE
Bye.
Liam leaves. Now it's just Professor and Wynora.
PROFESSOR
Well, best get these old bones to

bed.
He walks to the door, hesitates, then turns to Duke.

PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
Duke, I want to go with you. T
want to see my old frien
Cornelius.

WYNORA
Professor.

PROFESSOR
The way I think doesn't work around
here anymore.

DUKE
Of course. It'll make Cornelius
very happy.

Professor smiles and leaves.
Wynora and Duke sit alone in the dark room.
WYNORA

Sorry you have to stay here alone,
but 1Â£ I don't go home it'll look

suspicious.

DUKE
That's alright. I'll be fine.
80.

wynora hesitates for a moment, then...

WYNORA
Professor says there was a
civilization of humans before apes.
Is that true?

DUKE
Yes. I don't remember it
personally, but...

They both chuckle.

DUKE (CONT'D)
We live in the ruins of a place
called New York City.

WYNORA
That's unbelievable. You know,
your father is legendary to we
Simiantarians.

DUKE
Oh yeah?

WYNORA
Yeah, for twenty years Professor
has been talking about Cornelius
and Taylor, the speaking human.
To tell you the truth I wasn't
certain I believed it all, but

now...
DUKE
It's true. Cornelius has a son here
in the...
WYNORA

Pax. Professor's told us
everything about Cornelius.

DUKE
How has the secret managed to be
kept from Pax for so many years?

WYNORA
It's a testimony to Izan's tyranny.
No one would dare breathe a word
for fear of being executed.

Duke is saddened. Wynora starts for the door.

WYNORA
â't under any circumstances open
this door for anyone unless they
give the password.
81.

DUKE
what is it?

WYNORA
This week it's "blue skies"...Only
the six of us know it.

DUKE
Okay.
WYNORA
I'll be back first thing in the

morning. Sorry it's not more
comfortable in here.

DUKE
Don't worry about it. Just get
some sleep.

Wynora opens the door.

WYNORA
Good-night.

DUKE
Night.

Just as Wynora is closing the door he calls out to her.

Wynora...

WYNORA
(peeking back
in)

Yeah.

DUKE
Thanks for the ride.

Wynora smiles. The door shuts behind her.

Duke 1s alone now. He leans back in a chair and closes his eyes
for some long awaited sleep.

DISSOLVE TO

EXT. APE CITY - DAYBREAK

The yellow sun lazily rises signaling a new day for the Ape
Empire. Life goes on even under the iron fist of oppression.

ON A STREET a horse drawn street cleaning wagon washes the grime
out of the gutters.
82.

APE VENDORS are setting up their carts.

A TEAM OF CITY WORKERS raise the Izanian flags up the flagpoles
that surround the city.

HANGINGS START EARLY in the Ape City. The henchape is testing
the trap door.

A COUPLE OF GUARDS lead a line of PRISONERS, shackled at the
ankles, to the gallows. We recognize one as Izan's fool.
Perhaps one too many bad jokes. A small CROWD is gathering to
watch the killings.

Oblivious to everything Wynora walks briskly by the gallows. She
carries a small basket.

WE FOLLOW her as she makes her way through town.

INT. SIMIANTARIAN HIDEOUT - MORNING

A KNOCK on the door startles Duke awake. Instinctively he opens
it. There stands an angry Wynora.

WYNORA
Oh great.

DUKE
Ooops. Blue skies, right?
Unamused she walks in and closes the door.

WYNORA
That's not funny. You could have
gotten yourself killed.
(putting the
basket on the
table)
I brought you some breakfast.

Duke beams. He's famished. He starts eating, mostly fruit.

DUKE
Thanks. I'm starving.

WYNORA
We'll have to lay low for the day.
Once it's dark we'll take the sewer
to the end of town.

DUKE
Where are the others?

WYNORA
They're not coming, only Professor.
It's too risky today.
83,

DUKE
You sure you won't change your mind
and come with us?

WYNORA
(shakes her
head)
T can't.

DUKE
That's too bad. You would have
liked Ariel.

WYNORA
Ariel?

DUKE
The woman I love.

Wynora smiles.

SUDDENLY...

The peavy wooden door flies open with a CRASH. It breaks right
off its hinges. Duke and Wynora jump with shock.

GORILLA GUARDS pour into the hideout and swarm all over the two
frightened fugitives like wasps.

GUARD #1
Thought you'd get away, huh, you
SCUM!

Duke and Wynora put up a fight but it is no use. The guards are
too much for them.

WYNORA
Let go of me. Get your filthy
hands off me.

DUKE
(shouts)
Let go of her!

GUARD #2
Shut-up baldy.

Duke and Wynora are wisked out of the hideout with brute force.
They kick and scream the whole way.

The last gorilla in the room takes the oil lantern off the table.
He SMASHES it against the wall setting the room on fire.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

As Duke and Wynora are being muscled out a doorway and onto the
street, we see Professor approaching with his suitcase. Professor
84.

stops abruptly. He is horrified but is smart enough to keep his
composure. He watches through misty eyes as Duke and Wynora are
thrown into the cage of an official government paddy wagon.

The wagon pulls away.

Professor drops his suitcase. A tear rolls down his cheek as the
paddy wagon disappears around a corner. Black smoke pours out of
the doorway to the underground hideout.

cuT TO

DUKE AND WYNORA ARE THROWN ONTO THE DIRT. Their mouths hang
agape...Eyes as wide as saucers. They Slowly stand up. It is
deathly quiet. They are standing in the center of...

THE ARENA...

The bleachers are packed with multitudes of FANS, all sitting
silent and still. Suddenly Izan's rumbling voice BELLOWS OUT

from a megaphone horn..

IZAN (OS)
Welcome to the greatest show in
town.

ON IZAN, who looms larger than life from the bleachers, Pax at
his side.

IZAN (CONT'D)

(sarcastically)
Simians, anthropoids, and primates
of all ages...Might I attract your
attention to our very special
guests in the Arena today. You all
remember Duke, the human who tried
to kill your Supreme and precious
Tzan in cold blood? And standing
next to him is Wynora, the little
chimpette, who tried to help him
escape, killing twelve of my guards
in the process.

Petrified, Duke and Wynora stare at Izan. He points his pistol
at them, firing with great precision. The bullet hits the ground
near their feet in a cloud of dust. Duke and Wynora leap back.
Izan is amused.

IZAN (CONT'D)
(sardonically)
This is going to be fun!

Duke screams up to Izan at the top of his lungs.
85.

DUKE
This is between you and me, Izan.
Let Wynora go.

A rumble races through the bleachers.

IZAN
(yells to the
audience)

Silencet Have you never heard a
speaking human before?

There is instant quiet.

IZAN (CONT'D)
(to Duke)
How typical. Another bleeding
hearted human.

DUKE
Fuck youl!
The audience GASPS in shock. Izan's eyes bulge. He smiles.
IZAN

The crowd explodes like a bomb.
A heavy door rises, opening onto the Arena floor. Out steps...

THE MACHINE
Duke and Wynora are mortified at the size of this beast.

WYNORA
Uh-oh, we're dead.

For a second Duke clenches his eyes shut...

DUKE
(to himself)
Mind over muscle. Mind over
muscle. Mind over muscle...
(opening his

eyes)
Uh oh, you're right.
The Machine lurches towards them like a steam roller.

Wynora grabs Duke's hand. They take off like bat's out of hell.
The Machine charges after them. Round and round the arena they
dash for their lives. The Machine is gaining. Just when he i{s
within reach...

DUKE
(yells)
Now!!
86.

Duke and Wynora stop suddenly and reverse direction. To his
surprise they speed by the Machine on either side of him. The
monster comes to a SCREECHING halt. He pivots and takes out
after them in the other direction, GROWLING AND SNARLING the

whole way.

Duke and Wynora are racing at sonic speed. Momentarily, Duke
loses his footing and falls to the ground. He tumbles like a
rolling doughnut, disorienting himself. Wynora keeps running.
The machine heads straight for Duke.

WYNORA
(screams)
Duke, look out!

The Machine leaps into the air. Just as his big black feet are
about to crush Duke's skull...Duke blinks back to his senses and
rolls to the side. THUMP. The Machine's feet hit the dirt, just
missing Duke's head by a hair.

The blood-hungry crowd BOO and HISS.
Duke bounds to his feet. He's off again.

The Machine turns his back on Duke and races for Wynora. Her
heart POUNDS in her throat.

Duke desperately tries to distract the Machine.

DUKE
(shouting at
the top of his
lungs)
Here I am you goddamn ugly ape!
Over here! Over here!

The Machine turns a deaf ear and charges for Wynora. He backs
her against the wall. She can run no further. Dukes sprints
across the ring to save her. The Machine smiles at Wynora with
his big black teeth.

He lunges to flatten her against the wall. Wynora DUCKS in the
nick of time. SMACK. His massive torso hits the wall with full
force. She DARTS OUT between his hairy legs. She joins Duke.
They run.

The crowd is relishing the action-packed fury.

APES IN CROWD
Kill, kill, kill, kill....

From his box Izan signals to a GUARD. With that the guard throws
the long wooden pole into the center of the ring. Duke, Wynora,
and the Machine all stop. Duke and Wynora look at each other,
then make a mad dash for the pole. So does the Machine. They
run head-on.
87,

Duke grabs an end of the pole. The Machine grabs the other end.
The Machine swings the pole lifting Duke off his feet. With a
mighty swat Duke goes flying through the air. He hits the ground
with a THUD. Wynora hi-tails around and runs for Duke.

The Machine WHIPS the pole at Wynora's fleeing feet. The pole
flies through the air like a wayward helicopter propeller. It
SMACKS Wynora's ankles and tangles up her feet, sending her
tumbling forward. Duke SCRAMBLES to her side.

They look up. The Machine is barreling toward them.

Thinking quickly, Wynora and Duke each grab an end of the pole.
They jump to their feet, holding the pole like a low limbo stick.

Duke and Wynora charge toward him. CRACK. The Machine hits the
pole with his shins. He soars forward off his feet, and CRASH.
He hits his head on the stone wall knocking him unconscious.

The crowd GASPS in concerned horror. This has never happened
before. JEERS ring from the angry spectators.

Duke takes Wynora's hand and runs with her to the center of the
ring. They bow to all sides. Winners.

Izan clenches his teeth. He is furious, but acts cool.

Pax turns to his father.

PAX
(more visibly

upset)
Father, shoot them.
IZAN
(looking into
the ring,
grins)
Not yet.

Pax looks at Duke and Wynora.

Duke and Wynora are waving to the crowd. Smiles beam across
thelr faces.

Suddenly, from behind them, ja n tan

The crowd goes insanely wild.
Unbeknownst to Duke and Wynora the Machine walks up behind them.

He puts his arms around each of their shoulders and smiles.
Their expressions drop. Their hearts sink into their stomachs.

The Machine waves to his adoring fans. Izan and Pax are elated.
88.

DUKE
{to the

Machine)
I don't suppose we could finish

this up tomorrow?

The Machine's smile slowly fades to a scowl. He knocks Wynora
away with one arm. she goes sailing. The Machine takes his
other massive arm and tightens it around Duke's neck in a vice-
grip headlock. Duke is in agony.

Out of respect the Machine turns to Izan. Will it be thrumbs up
or thumbs down? The audience goes silent. Surprise! It's
thumbs down.

The Machine digs his fingers into the fleshy part of Duke's neck.
The beast lets out a mighty ROAR of triumph. Suddenly...

Wynora THRUSTS the wooden pole into the Machine's gaping mouth.
CHOKE

The Machine drops Duke and REELS backward. He YANKS at the pole
that is lodged in his throat.

Duke scrambles to his feet. He and Wynora run like the wind.

Izan is enraged. He grabs the megaphone and bellows to the
Machine.

IZAN
(fuming)
What the hell is the matter with
you, dammit? Kill them you idiot.
Kill them or die!

With a forceful TUG the Machine pulls the pole out of his
windpipe. CRACK. He breaks the pole over his knee and spits a
wad of blood. Boy is he mad.

The Machine takes off after Wynora and Duke like a rocket. Duke
and Wynora are running with all their might. They dash straight
for the wall. The Machine is gaining fast.

With a burst of adrenelin strength Duke jumps off the ground and
grabs onto the top of the restraining wall. He hoist himself
into the front row of the bleachers. The shocked fans scurry.

Duke reaches down for Wynora's hand. He heaves her up the wall.
Just as she is about to clear, the Machine grabs her foot. How
will she escape? Her shoe comes off.

IZAN
(raging into
the megaphone)
Will you stop embarrassing me, you
moron, and get them.
89.

Duke and Wynora storm up the bleachers through the scattering
spectators.

The Machine VAULTS the wall and CHARGES through the crowd after
them like a bulldozer killing and knocking apes out of his way
left and right.

Izan isn't getting his money's worth. He watches the frenetic
action with a scowl on his face.

Duke and Wynora speed through aisles on a mad dash for their
lives. They dart in and around seats. Over scattering fans.
And up to the top of the colisuem. The Machine follows close

behind.
The harrowing chase continues along the upper ledge of the

coliseum. Duke and Wynora do thelr best to balance as they run
along the narrow top rim.

The panoramic view of Ape City and the desert behind them is
Spectacular.

The crowd is going nuts.

The Machine is hot on Duke and Wynora's tail. The pace is fast
and furious. Suddenly, for lack of a shoe, Wynora loses her
footing and falls over the edge.

WYNORA
(screams)
Duke!!

She grabs the ledge for dear life. Clinging by her fingertips
Wynora dangles sixty feet above [zan Square. Duke rushes to her
aid: He pulls with all his might, still trying to maintain his
alance.

Like a Sasquatch the Machine is getting closer.

As Duke strains to save Wynora his eye catches movement in the
distance. He looks out and is stunned at what he sees.

 

DUKE
(sotto voce)

oh amy!
WYNORA
(screams)
DUKE! LOOK OUT!

Duke turns his head. There's the Machine.

In a single bolt of blind strength Duke heaves Wynora under his
arm and leaps over the edge.
90.

Duke and Wynora fly through space.

with his free arm Duke grabs a flagpole. The force of their
bodies send them spiraling down the flagpole like a corkscrew.

Down, down, down they spin.
At the top of the coliseum the Machine hesitates.

IZAN
(furflously)
After them you imbicile.

The Machine looks to Izan in disbellef.

IZAN (CONT'D)
JUMP!!!

The Machine jumps off the edge for the flagpole. Like a great
terradactile he soars through the air. Grabbing the flagpole,
his massive weight proves too much. SNAP. The pole breaks. The
Machine tangles up in the flag of Izan as he plummets to the
ground. SLAM. He hits the pavement like a slab of meat.

OUTSIDE THE ARENA...

All the armed guards and screaming fans pour out of the coliseum
doors and into Izan Square.

Duke clutches his ankle. Wynora pulls at him.
WYNORA
(frantic)
Come ont!

Duke tries to right himself, but collapses again.

DUKE
(in pain)
It's my foot. Run Wynora run!
WYNORA

(tugging at
him)
You can do it! Come on!
The guards charge closer.
Duke screams at Wynora with rage.

DUKE
Gott!

Determined, Wynora grabs Duke's arm to drag him if she has to.
91.

WYNORA
Damn you!
Duke tries as hard as he can to move with Wynora. She pivots to
run...Suddenly she is face to face with a rearing horse. She
SCREAMS. It is Ariel.

There in front of them on horseback stand Ariel, Cornelius, and
the human army poised and ready to take off like lightening.

ARIEL
(screaming)
DUKE! QUICKLY!!

fynora hoists Duke onto the back of Ariel's horse. Duke and Ariel
iss.

DUKE
Ariel!

ARIEL
I'm so glad you're alive.

Wynora leaps onto Corneliusâ horse.

CORNELIUS
(to Duke)
Thank heavens you're safe.

WYNORA
Let's get the hell outta here!
Their horses rear to charge, but...

It's too late. They're surrounded on all sides by gorilla
guards, rifles pointing at their heads.

Trapped like rats.
Suddenly Izan's evil volce BELLOWS OUT.
IZAN

CORNELIUS!

Dead-silence. Score of APES surround the action, riveted.
Amongst them Wingding, Liam, Miles, Orpheus, and Professor.

Cornelius shudders. Izan steps out from the crowd.

IZAN (CONT'D)
Cornelius, Cornelius, what a
pleasant surprise.
(to the crowd)
Now here before me stands an ape I
truly never thought I would see
again.
92.

CORNELIUS
Hello Izan. We have not come for
trouble, only for Duke. And now if
you'll excuse us.

IZAN

Not so fast. Not so fast. It's
been so long since we've seen each
other. Let me get a good look at
you.

(scopes him up

and down)
You've gotten old Cornelius.

(chuckles)
I want to introduce you to someone.

Cornelius' eyes widen.

Pax steps out from the crowd and joins Izan. Corneliusâ breath
is taken away by the sight of his son. He is speechless.

Duke and Ariel are concerned. This must be torture.

Pax's eyes widen but he quickly resumes a cold glare at
Cornelius. Izan SMIRKS.

IZAN
Cornelius, have you ever met my son
Pax?

Pax makes eye contact with Duke, then speaks in a tone to satisfy
Izan.

PAX
Father, who ts this old chimp?

DUKE
(screams out)
You know who he is Pax!

IZAN
Shut-up!
(to Cornelius)
Look at him, the pride of my
Empire. Someday this all will be
his. And he'll rule it my way!

Pax stares at Cornelius as if he wasn't there.
IZAN (CONT'D)
Look around you Cornelius. What do
you see?

Cornelius sits motionless.
93.

IZAN (CONT'D)
Wealth. Power. Fear. You were
wrong. Taylor was wrong. I was
right! Strength will always
triumph over words.

Izan LAUGHS at Cornelius and his group of humans.

TZAN (CONT'D)
Is this what you came here to
battle me with? A pathetic handful
of humans on horseback? How
typical Cornelius. How very
typical.

CORNELIUS
We didn't come here to battle. We
came for Duke.

DUKE
Cornelius is a braver ape than you
are Izan. He doesn't have to hide
behind guards and guns and power.

CORNELIUS
Duke!

Izan is getting very angry.

DUKE
I'm not afraid of him Cornelius.

IZAN
Enough of this nonsense. I'm
getting very bored with Duke.
GUARDS! Take aim.

RIFLES COCK.

IZAN
This is the last anyone will ever
hear from a talking human. Guards.
Kill the mutant.

CORNELIUS
Not

WYNORA
Nol

Suddenly A VOICE rings out.
ARTEL

Tf it's mutants you want, then
you'll have to kill me too!
94,

ALBERT

And me!

THE GUARD'S HEADS DART TO FIND WHERE THE VOICES COME FROM.

IZAN

Who said that?
CHARLIE

Who do you think Izan?
JONAS

I did fzan!
GEORGE

Us mutants!

THEN Izan, beside himself, realizes the voices are human.

DARA
TÂ£ you kill Duke then kill me too.

ARIEL

What's the matter Izan, you scared?
DUKE

Izan, you look like you've seen a

ghost!

The guards are spooked. Izan is in shock that all the humans can
speak. Their voices ring out loudly. They all shout at once.

ALL THE HUMANS
Wake up to the truth...Let us go...
Peace on earth...Power to the
people. . Power to the spoken
word...etc.

The noise level grows. It's driving Izan insane. THE HUMANS
SHOUT LOUDER AND LOUDER. It is a frenzied whirlwind of
confusion. Pax is smiling at this circus.

CORNELIUS
(screams over
the noise)
You cannot hide from the truth
anymore Izan. You've built a
kingdom on lies. Now let the truth
tear it down.

More crazed than ever before Izan SHOOTS his pistol into the air
and SCREAMS at the top of his lungs...

IZAN
SILENCE!!!
95.

In_a desperate move of insanity Izan holds the gun against Pax's

head.
Pax 1s horrified. what's going on?

PAX
Father!!
CORNELIUS
(panicked)
Izan don't!
IZAN

(bellowing to

Cornelius)
Nobody makes a fool of Izan! I
warned you long ago Cornelius if
you ever came back here I would
kill your son!

Pax is shocked. It's true.

CORNELIUS
Please Izan, no! I beg of y
Spare my son! Spare Pax! K
instead! !

âoul
411 me

DUKE
Cornelius, no!

Cornelius jumps off his horse and runs to Izan and Pax.
CORNELIUS

Kill me! Kill me! But let Pax
livet
Izan sneers.
IZAN

(pressing the

gun into Pax's

temple)
Kill you instead of Pax? That
wasn't the original agrement
Cornelius. You wouldn't want me to
go back on my word, would you?

PAX
Father, please.

CORNELIUS
Take me. Spare my son.

Izan takes the gun away from Pax's head.

IZAN
Okay. Pax lives. You die!
96.

Duke and Ariel are mortified.

ARIEL
(shouts to
Cornelius)
Cornelius we need you.

Cornelius raises his hand to silence her.
IZAN
(to Pax)
Pax, prove your loyalty to me and
to the gorillas. Put a bullet
between this chimp's eyes!

Duke and Ariel look at each other, fear on their faces.
Cornelius' eyes bug.

with a glare of ice Pax raises his pistol from his holster. He
points it at Cornelius. Izan grins.

Pax stares into Cornelius' desperate eyes.
CORNELIUS
(whispers)

Always remember I am your real

father.
There is a uneasy stillness. Pax COCKS the gun.
Everyone waits.
Pax's hand begins to tremble.

Izan scowls.

IZAN
(screams)
Shoot!
Pax's hand quivers even more. Izan is becoming furious.
IZAN (CONT'D)

Shoot dammit...Shoot!!

Ferociously Izan points his own gun at Cornelius and COCKS IT.
Just as he is about to pull the trigger...

wo an!

The crowd is stunned.

Tzan ts livid.

PAX
Don't!
97.

IZAN
(screams)
You wouldn't dare!

PAX
(with the evil
that Izan has
taught)
Drop your gun!

IZAN
(screams again)
You wouldn't dare!

PAX COLDLY COCKS HIS PISTOL. HE'S LEARNED FROM THE MASTER.

IZAN
(smirks)
I've taught you well, you selfish,
ungrateful, little chimp. You will
pay dearly for this. I should have
known...Once a chimp, always a
chimp.

As he speaks SUDDENLY...

From behind Izan a hulking black monolith slowly rises to his
feet and INTO FRAME...THE MACHINE!

Pax's eyes bulge. Cornelius quakes. Duke, Ariel, and Wynora are
petrified. Izan is unaware, until...

The Machine's titanic hand CLAMPS down on Izan's shoulder like a
vice.

Izan reacts with unbridled horror. The Machine whips Izan around
to face him. He clenches Izan's throat and lifts him off his
feet as if he were weightless.

BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. Izan empties his gun into the
Machine's chest. The Machine doesn't flinch. Then...

The Machine SQUEEZES with his giant hands until...

CRACK! Izan's neck snaps. His eyes roll over black. His pistol
hits the ground.

The Machine lets go of Izan's limp body. THUD. It hits the
pavement.

Blood pours from the Machine's chest and mouth. He REARS his
head and ROARS.

THE MACHINE
I always wanted to do that.

Then he falls forward...dead.
98,

A chilling silence. All eyes turn to Pax. Pax stands for a long
while over Izan's body. No one dares to move. Pax's eyes slowly
survey all the staring faces. He is emotionless. Pax walks over
to a huge statue of Izan which towers over all of Izan square.
His footsteps are the only sound heard.

He leaps onto the base of the massive statue.

PAX
(shouting to
al

1)
Izan is dead! The legacy has come
to pass. The Empire of the Apes
is mine!

The crowd listens silently.

Pax, a chimpanzee, will rule
his Empire. Izan taught me
leadership. Izan taught me
strength. He taught me to rule
relentless and hard. To rule with
an iron Â£ist. To rule his way.

There's a tension in the air. What is he leading to?

PAX (CONT'D)

(a dramatic

pause)
But Izan was right...Once a
chimpanzee, always a chimpanzee!
From this day forward things will
be run my way. This day has opened
my eyes to something I have been
refusing to see for too long. I'm
tired of the lies. I'm sick of the
bloodshed. And I'm weary from the
hatred.

Pax SHOUTS with a passion never heard before.

PAX (CONT'D)

Today {ts a good day, for Izan's
death marks the birth of a new age.
The rules have changed. The mol
has been broken. The torch has
been passed to a new generation of
primates. Let the curtain of
Oppression rise. And let the sun
sh ne down on the Planet of the
pes.

At that very instant...
B-0-0-0-0-M!
99.

The head of the statue of Izan that Pax 1s standing under BLOWS
UP in a ball of white fire. Sand, ash, and sparks shower down on
the masses like confetti on New Year's Eve.

The crowd EXPLODES into raucous cheers of happiness.
Amidst the hoopla Pax reaches out his hand to Cornelius.

PAX
Father.

Cornelius takes Pax's hand. He is hoisted up onto the base of
the statue. He stands with his son.

Pax waves to the jubilant throngs.

The humans jump down from their horses and rejoice with the apes.
There is dancing in the streets.

Ariel and Duke hug. They never expected this.

Orpheus and Liam make their way through the bustling crowd to
Wynora.

WYNORA
Which one of you planted that
dynamite?

Liam and Orpheus point at each other simultaneously.

WYNORA (CONT'D)
(laughing)
Perfect timing. We couldn't have
Planned it better if we tried.

For a Simiantarian this is paradise. They hoot and holler
together.

Cornelius and Pax are waving to the masses. They look at each
other and suddenly twenty years are erased. Cornelius puts his
arms around his son. They hug.

In a burst of youth, Professor dances with a guard, square-dance
style.

All across the Empire the flags of Izan are being ripped down
from their flagpoles. The posters of his face are being torn off

the walls.

Miles and Singding are breaking open cages of HUMAN SLAVES,
setting them free to join the jubilation.

Wynora and Duke hug. Suddenly Wynora hears her name being called.
She looks up to see Pax holding out his hand to her. She
cautiously takes it and stands next to him.
PAX
(to wynora)
You are a brave chimp Wynora. I
like what you stand for. I will
need your help.

Wynora and Pax stare into each others eyes. She nods and smiles.

CLOSE ON ARIEL AND DUKE as they kiss passionately.

WE SLOWLY PULL UP...UP...UP to an AERIAL VIEW of the Ape City. As
we hover above the mass celebration in the streets, Ariel's
narration is heard.

ARIEL (VO)
And so the Planet of the Apes was
given a second chance. The legend
would continue, but this time with
a new hope for tomorrow and a
valued lesson from yesterday. We
all know Taylor would be proud of
us. Perhaps from somewhere he's
even watching down and smiling.

DISSOLVE TO

EXT. BEACH - SUNDOWN

Duke and Ariel sit on a horse together. Orange light fills the
sky and glows on their faces.

The Statue of Liberty juts half way out from under the sand. Her
symbol of freedom is as powerful today as it was thousands of
years ago. Duke and Ariel smile up at âLady Liberty" and know
they are on the dawning of a new age.

FADE TO BLACK
