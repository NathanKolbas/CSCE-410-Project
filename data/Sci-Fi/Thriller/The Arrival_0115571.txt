GORDIAN
But if it’s a variable, it expands
and contracts dramatically. How could
intelligent life actually develop in
such a volatile --

ZANE "
It’s only been unstable for the last
50 years, which means it’s possible
that some kind of life could still
exist there. Maybe it’s a distress
call. Maybe they’re sending out their
Encyclopedia Gallactica, jettisoning
all their knowledge before it goes
down with the ship. Maybe it's --

GORDIAN
(soberingly)
It‘s 42 seconds, Zane. And it never
repeated.

ZANE
That's why we gotta stay on this one,
Gordy -~ in case it does. 1/11 pull

The man on stage can’t ignore it any longer.

TERRAFORMER
Excuse me. But perhaps you’d care to
use the microphone?

ZANE
Thanks.

Startling the man, Zane vaults onto stage and commandeers
the lectern.

ZANE (CONT’D)
Gordian? Is he here? I need to talk
to Phil Gor....-

In the audience, one dark shape rises.

GORDIAN |
fhe man was in the middle of a

outside while --

ZANE
Did you even give it to Decoding?
Did you even see what was there?

GORDIAN
What are we talking about?

ZANE
The tape! The signal! If you/’re not
going to analyze it, I want my tape
back!

GORDIAN
I’m sorry, Zane, but...1 just don’t
know what you're referring to.

A beat -- then Zane drops the mike and goes for him.
Bodies intervene: The guards are here.

Listen, Zane -~

ZANE
But then I remembered. It should
still be on the backup DAT system.
We still got a copy of the signal,
right?

CALVIN
Well, yes and no....-

He looks over his shoulder at two grey-suited men -- the
D.O.D. GUYS. They’re confiscating station logs, computer
print-outs.

CALVIN (CONT‘D)
(shielding his voice)
There's some D.O.D. guys here going
through our stuff. Apparently it was
a burst from a spy satellite.

ZANE
What?

CALVIN
It's a defense thing, Zane. Which is
probably why Gordian couldn’t tell you
about it. We aren’t cleared for this
spy shit.

ZANE
Cal, Cal, Cal. Listen to me very
carefully. Satellites don’t move like
stars move. We tracked the thing in
sidereal time, okay? In star time.
Now I don’t know who these guys are
-- but I do know they’re lying to you.

Little hairs start dancing on Cal’s neck. He does a
slow-turn to check on the men...

And one is right there, right in his face.

CLOSE on a computer screen. An Historical Sequence Model
is being run for "Greenhouse Trace Gasses." A half-dozen
spots dilate across the Earth’s mid-section -~ first yellow

like bleeding wounds.

"700 percent" increase over the last
five years? How can that be?

Standing behind a COMPUTER TECHNICIAN, Ilana and the N-CAR
MAN trade looks.

N-CAR MAN
My very question. Just how accurate
is this database you sent us, Ilana?

ILANA
Hard to say. We cobbled it together
from ground stations, balloon readings,
and Uncle Earl’s aching corns. Some
of your own numbers in there.

Hiking shorts and Timberline boots -~ probably an American.
Not drop-dead gorgeous like Char. But there’s something
about her that keeps Zane looking. Something independent.
Brazen.

Now their eyes touch. Zane considers inviting himself
over: It'd be a natural thing to do -- two compatriots in
a foreign land. Sharing a beer. Some laughs. Maybe even
a bed. Yeah, that sure would be nice...

But Zane drops his money on the table and leaves. That’s
not why he came to Mexico.

Ilana Green goes back to her reading.

In the bathroom, an old ball~and~claw tub fills with water.

Presently a drip hits his face. Zane opens one eye to
consider...

The ceiling. The drip comes from a hairline crack.

ZANE
“phe much very best hotel...."

With simian dexterity, he adjusts knobs with his feet,
topping off the tub. MESSAGE #2 plays.

Fed by the ceiling crack, a rivulet of water runs down
a side wall. Soon water is sheeting down.

But Zane is oblivious, his attention devoted now to
MESSAGE #3:

CHAR (V.0.)
I called this morning. Just didn’t
leave a message. You there now?

(a beat)
Well...I guess I didn't get back to
you that night because I was mad.

I get so tired of being questioned,
Zane -- about even the kasic things.
And maybe I was feeling some guilt,
too, for steering you away from what
you should be doing...what you love
the most. But you were such an ass
the last time we talked....
(a beat)
Damn, can’t remember if this machine
lets you ramble -- so I better just
admit this quick: I miss your weird
paranoid brain. Cali when you can.
(a beat)
Where are you, Zane?

A HANGUP. The voice was melancholy yet inviting, and it
got to Zane. He blows a sigh, reaches over the side of the
tub to cradle the phone -- and frowns. Water is pooling on
the floor. Zane double-checks...

The crack in the ceiling. It’s tripled in size.

Zane erupts from the tub just as...

The whole CEILING COLLAPSES and...

A second tub crash-lands into the bathroom. Porcelain

explodes. .A-window shatters. A wave of water rolls Zane

There’s another hole in her floor. The wreckage of three
tubs lies in the ground-floor bathroom.

A wall mirror. In it, we see the reflection of a man

The screwdriver rolis in Zane’s tormented hand. Is it
possible? Did he have two controls? Zane’s mind says yes
~- but his soul riots at the thought.

Reaching a decision, Zane activates a closed-circuit

Now it’s a tug-of-war: Backpedaling, Zane lets the chain

the chain around it once. Wants to wrap it again -- but
there’s no more length. Alli he can do is hold on. But now
Zane’s stuck here when he desperately needs to be at...

Zane. For once in your paranoid life,

Putting his life in her hands, zane releases. He bounds
