OPEN ON:

EXT. THE S' ACE OF T! SUN

It never coalesces. It’s something we can't quite
comprehend. Too much power, too massive, too ancient.

The image boils and rages, and is completely hypnotic.
The noise is overwhelming.
Over this, the TITLE:

SUNSHINE

EXT s
+». The curve of the sun against the dark of space, where

solar flares arc thousands of miles, before the vast gravity
of the star pulls them back...

EXT. SPACE

 

-.. Now tens of millions of miles distant from the star,
where the sound of fission and countless rolling nuclear
detonations are silenced by the vacuum...

EXT. ICARUS II
+++ a SPACESHIP is heading towards the sun.

The ship is curved and organic in its design, with bulky
flanks that look as if they can detach from the rest of the
vessel.

Most striking of all, the ship is covered in mirrored panels,
similar to fish scales.

The mirrored panels cover the entire surface of the ship,
except for the window portals, and a geodesic dome situated
towards the back. These portals and the dome are constructed
with a thick half-mirrored glass.

The distances involved are so huge between the ship and the
sun that it hardly seems to be moving.
But as we get closer, and we see space dust and particles
flash past or colliding with the huli, detonating and burning
under the impact and friction, we realise that in fact the
ship is travelling at an extraordinarily fast speed.

On the SPACESHIP’S side is its name: ICARUS II.

Ir REAT I! ROOM

In the RECREATION ROOM of the ICARUS II, two men sit either
side of a small table, arms folded, their faces a picture of
deep thought.

The first, and older, of these two men is CAPTAIN ASHER. The
ICARUS II is under his command. He’s a career astronaut.
Implacable, calm, experienced.

The younger of the two men is CAPA. CAPA is a career
physicist. In contrast to ASHER, CAPA is thin, young, nervy,
and looks unkempt. He has a couple of weeks beard-growth,

and his hair is a bedraggled.

Between them is a CHESS BOARD - sparse pieces, scattered.
The end game.

Silence.

No movement from either of them.
The moment is held.

And held.

Finally, CAPA puffs out his cheeks and expelsa loud sigh.
He reaches for his KING, and tips it over.

He has RESIGNED.
ASHER nods.

ASHER
Good game.

They shake hands.
CAPA checks his watch.

CAPA
Three and a half hours.

ASHER
A long one.
CAPA
Really takes it out of you. All
that concentration.

ASHER
It does.

A moment. ‘

Then silently both men start to reset the board to play
again.

ENT. OXYGEN GARDEN

CORAZON, a woman in her early thirties, a Biologist, kneels
beside a tall tree fern, using secateurs to trim away dead
fronds.

In fact, she is surrounded by ferns, of all species and
sizes.

The ground is a carpet of mosses.
CORAZON looks as if she is in a prehistoric jungle, except
that above her is a geodesic dome, behind which is outer
space and the constellation of stars.

IT. FLIGH' ECK
On the flight deck of the ICARUS II, two more astronauts sit
in front of their instrument panel, which glitters with back-
lit displays and switches. -

These are MACE and CASSIE - flight crew, in the PILOT and Co-
PILOT seats.

But“neither have their seat-straps on, or look like they are
doing much in the way of piloting.

MACE has his seat reclined, and is dozing with his chin on
his chest and his feet propped up on the instrument panel.

CASSIE is reading a book.

The book is LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER.

MACE stirs in his sleep, and his foot shifts...

«+. flicking a switch to ‘off' position with his heel.

CASSIE, engrossed in her novel, hasn’t noticed.
ccyyrere oo

Nothing happens for a couple of moments.
Then:
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Warning. Coolant from port
stabiliser redirected to rear :
engines. No extra coolant in rear >
engines ‘required. Recommend
coolant redirection is cancelled.
CASSIE, unconcerned, not looking up from her book:

CASSIE
Fine.

The switch flicks itself back.

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Coolant redirection cancelled.

CASSIE doesn’t bother to respond...
«+. but does reach out with her hand to swipe at MACE’S legs.

Grumbling through his sleep, MACE takes his feet off the
instrument panel, and rolls over on to his side.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS

Another two crew are asleep in their bunks, visible only as
silhouettes behind their frosted-glass privacy partitions.

We can‘t see them, but the names on their bunks read:

HARVEY and TREY.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

The Observation room is three walls and a huge window. The
room is at the most forward position of the ICARUS II,
therefore this window faces the sun.

But the window is darkened greatly.

The sun is only visible as a dull orange orb surrounded by
blackness.

The room itself is only lit by the dull orange...
«++ but in the gloom, sitting on the observation couch,
facing the window, we can see a man.

SEARLE - the doctor and psychiatrist of ICARUS II.

SEARLE
Icarus. +

The ELECTRONIC VOICE, the voice of ICARUS, replies

ICARUS
Yes, Doctor Searle.

SEARLE
Please re-filter the observation
room portal.

TCARUS
Filter up or down, Doctor Searle?

SEARLE
Up-
«+. And the light levels dial up.

The room brightens considerably. We can see SEARLE clearly
now. He is the oldest crew-member - in his mid-forties.

He gazes at the sun, fascinated. Though still distant, the
star is much larger and closer than we have ever seen it on
Earth.

SEARLE is as hypnotised by the sight as we were during the
opening sequence.

SEARLE
Icarus - how close is this to full
brightness?

ICARUS

At this distance of thirty six
million miles, you are observing
the sun at two percent of full
brightness. —

SEARLE
(smiling)
Two percent... Can you show me four
percent?
ICARUS
Four percent would result in
irreversible damage to your
retinas. However, you could
observe three point one percent,
for a period of not longer than
thirty seconds.

A moment. °

SEARLE
Icarus - please change filter to
three point oné percent.

An amazing blast of bleaching brightness fills the room.
SEARLE sucks in a gasp, like a man diving into ice water.

FADE TO WHITE.

NT.

In the MESS, the entire crew of ICARUS II are sitting down to
eat. .

SEARLE sits with CAPA and CORAZON.

SEARLE
It's invigorating. It’s like
taking a shower. In light.

CAPA
Sounds weird.

SEARLE
It is. You lose yourself a little.

CORAZON
Like a floatation tank.

SEARLE
Actually, no. For psych-tests on
deep space, I’ve run many sensory
deprivation trials, testing total
darkness in floatation tanks. The
point about darkness is: you float
in it. You and the darkness are
distinct from each other because
darkness is a vacuum, an absence of
something, whereas we are
something.
SEARLE pauses.

SEARLE
But total light - it envelopes you.
It swallows you up. It becomes
you.

SEARLE laughs.

SEARLE
Anyway. It’s very strange.. I
recommend it.

MACE is passing with his tray of food.

MACE
What's strange is, you’re the psych--
officer on this ship, and I'm
clearly a lot saner than you.

Now FOLLOWING MACE...
-+- who sits with ASHER, CASSIE and HARVEY.

MACE
So - in case you hadn’t noticed...

ASHER
I had. The solar wind reading is
higher than we'd anticipated at
this distance,

All look to HARVEY ~ Comms officer.

HARVEY
For the moment, we can still send
: package messages back. High
frequency bursts will rise above
— the interference, and the moon
stations will pick them up okay...
(beat)
But it's possible that within forty
eight hours we won't be able to
communicate at all.

ASHER
Possible?

HARVEY
Probable.

CASSIE gives a little shiver.
CASSIE
We'll be on our own.

MACE shrugs.

MACE
We're fifty five million miles from
Earth. We’re already on our own. “>

All in the mess room have now fallen quiet. They listen to
ASHER speak.

ASHER
We were all expecting this. No
great drama - we’re just flying
into the dead-zone seven days
earlier than we thought. But if
any of you were planning on sending
a final message home, you might
want to get on it now.

INT. COMMS CUBICLE

CAPA sits in a small cubicle, facing a screen, which shows
his own face looking back at him.

The image on the screen is frozen, and of low resolution.

The door to the cubicle is clear glass, and behind it we can
see the COMMUNICATION CENTER. In the Comms Center are MACE,
TREY and HARVEY. They are talking, but the glass door is
fully soundproofed and we can’t hear what they’re saying.

CAPA hits a button on the console in front of.him, and the
image on the screen begins to play.

CAPA RECORDING
Well. Mum and Dad. I hope you're
proud of your son, saving mankind
and so on. Don’t be hard on my big
sister just because she isn’t
saving mankind. Listen - being a
full-time housewife makes her just
as deserving of your love and
respect as me.
(beat) .
Did I mention I was saving mankind?
(beat)
Sis - guess what? I miss your
cooking. I hope Maxwell is doing
okay. Kiss the kids from me. And
kiss John too.
(MORE)
10.

CAPA RECORDING (cont’d)}

A big kiss, right on lips. With
tongues. I know he likes that.

(beat)
It takes about eight minutes for
light to travel from the sun to
Earth. Which means you'll know if
we succeeded about eight minutes
after we deliver the payload. All +
you have to do is look out fora
little extra brightness in the sky.
So if you wake up one morning, and
it’s a particularly beautiful
day...

(shrugs)
«+. you'll know we made it.

(beat)
See you in a couple of years.

"The recording ends.

CAPA looks at his frozen face a couple more moments. His ~
finger hovers midway between two buttons on the console:

DELETE and SEND.

He presses ‘SEND’.

EXT. ICARUS II
ICARUS iI flies through space.

With an effect similar to Northern Lights, the glow of the
SOLAR WIND kicks up and flickers around the hull.

INT. OB! ATION RO:

CORAZON enters the observation room.

It is extremely bright. She winces, shielding her eyes.

CORAZON
Icarus, dial it down a little, will
you?

ICARUS

Yes, Corazon.

The light fades to a lower level, revealing something that
was too bright to see previously...

sitting on the observation couch is CAPTAIN ASHER.
li.

His eyes are wide, a little glazed. He looks almost in a

trance.

CORAZON
+++ Captain?

ASHER blinks, and rubs at his eyes.
CORAZON

I’m guessing you've been talking to
Searle.

ASHER looks towards CORAZON, and seems to take a few moments

to actually see her.

ASHER .

Did you send a package back?
CORAZON :

I did. To my husband. You?
ASHER

I said my goodbyes before I left.
CORAZON

I didn't realise I was saying

goodbye.
ASHER smiles perfunctorily.

ASHER
How are the ferns holding up?

CORAZON

Fine. Very high productivity. In-.
fact, their productivity is going
up- It will tail off dramatically
when we get nearer. But in truth,
we already have the reserves to
make it there, and quarter-way
back.

(beat) :
You’re thinking about Icarus One.

ASHER says nothing.

CORAZON
Whatever it was that tripped them
up, I can tell you it wasn’t lack
of oxygen. Not on the outward
journey, at any rate.
 

 

12.

ASHER
I’1) tick it off my list.

INT. COMMS CENTER

CLOSE UP on: ‘>

The faces of CAPA and MACE.

They are right next to each other, temples crushed together.
Both men are straining, teeth gritted, eyes blazing.

It takes a moment to realise they are FIGHTING in the
COMMUNICATION CENTER.

MACE - much bigger and stronger than CAPA - has CAPA in a
headlock. |

MACE suddenly swings CAPA around in a judo throw and slams
him hard onto the floor.

Then he’s on CAPA, swinging his fist, punching CAPA in the
face...

Then he’s being hauled off by HARVEY and TREY.

TREY
Mace ~ what the Hell are you doing?

MACE
(struggling, yelling at
Capa)
Little fucking prick! Mother
fucker!

HARVEY and TREY pin MACE against the wall as CAPA scrambles
backwards.

HARVEY
Mace! Cut it out!

MACE
He took three quarters of a fucking
hour in there! Now the fucking
wind is too high for me to send my
package home!

CAPA
(wiping blood off his
mouth and nose)
(MORE)
13.

CAPA (cont'd)
I’m sorry! I didn’t realise I was
taking so long!

MACE -
I've got kids! What if I never get
a chance to talk to them again?

CAPA
I’m sorry! I’m sorry! >

Int. MED CENTER

MACE sits opposite SEARLE.

MACE is nursing his knuckles in one hand, breathing hard.
Silence between the two men.

Eventually:

MACE
So how does this work?

SEARLE says nothing.

MACE
Am I supposed to tell you about my
childhood?

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS
ASHER sits in his CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS.

- He’s looking at a screen. On the screen, we can see it is a
live feed from the MED CENTER, where MACE is talking to
SEARLE.

ASHER‘S face is blank, unreadable as he listens in on what
MACE is saying...

MACE
One way to look at it is one flare-
up in sixteen months isn’t bad.
We're humans, right? This is what
we do. We... make mistakes.
(beat)
It doesn’t matter how high the
stakes, no matter how hard you
try...
(beat) .
I mean - look at us.

14,

MACE (cont'd)

We’re the key component part of the
most important action that man has
ever undertaken. But Capa decides
he doesn’t want to shave or cut his
hair.: I fall asleep on duty.
Cassie reads the same book over and
over. Asher stares at a chess
board all day. And Corazon talks ‘+
to her plants...

(beat)
Sixteen months is a long time.

(beat)
But I messed up.

MACE turns to look directly at the screen - and we realise he
knows he is being watched.

: MACE - mo
It isn’t going to happen again.
INT. RECREATION ROOM

CAPA sits alone. His lip is split, but the cut is small and
has dried over.

MACE enters.
CAPA looks round.
A moment between them.

CAPA
Mace. I really am sorry. I should
have let you go first, and...

MACE
(cutting in)
Hey. It‘s me. I’m the one
_ apologising, okay?

CAPA
eee Okay.

MACE sits opposite CAPA.

MACE
Searle told me why I lost my
temper. Apparently I’ve got
unresolved anger issues with my
Dad.

A beat.
15.

CAPA
++. Really?

MACE
No. It turns out I’m just a
fucking idiot.

INT. CO! NTE.
HARVEY sits in the COMMS CENTER.
We can hear the fuzz sound of radio static.

But behind the static is another noise ~ looping, arcing
tones and pitches.

This is the sound of the interference caused by SOLAR WIND.

HARVEY is checking through digital frequencies. The
intensity of the static in relation to the solar wind varies,
but neither can be cancelled entirely.

HARVEY speaks into a microphone.

HARVEY
Icarus Two to Moon Stations. This
package timed at fifteen thirty
two, day four hundred and eight
four, comms delay at five minutes
and seventeen seconds. Total radio
silence now for four hours and
eleven minutes. Please respond.

Long beat. -

HARVEY
Icarus Two to Moon Stations. This
package timed at fifteen thirty
three, day four eight four, comms
delay at five minutes and seventeen
seconds. Total radio silence now
for four hours and...

HARVEY breaks off.

HARVEY
Twelve minutes.

Long beat.

HARVEY
Please respond.
 

 

16.

Long beat.
HARVEY
(quiet)
Okay.
{beat} .
Moon stations. This is Icarus Two.
Signing out.
HARVEY hits a button and the sound of the static cuts dead.
Now we can only hear the SOLAR WIND.
The noise is strange, abstract but almost melodic.

HARVEY remains sitting in his chair, listening.

Ex®. ICARUS IT
Hearing the SOLAR WIND, seeing the NORTHERN LIGHTS effect...

-.- Leoking down through the Geodesic dome, where CORAZON
kneels by her plants...

Then looks straight up at us...

cut TO:

EXT, ICARUS IL

-+- Looking back at the nose of ICARUS II, where, in the very
center of the nose, we can see the portal to the Observation
Room...

.-+ where SEARLE sits, looking out at us, bathed in light.

INT. FLIGHT DECK
CASSIE sits in the pilot’s seat.

Her dog-eared copy of LADY CHATTERLY’S LOVER is face down on
the console, folded open about two thirds through the text.

She has a wide portal in front of her, similar to the portal
to the Observation Room, but this is cluttered with the
symbols and readings of a HEADS UP DISPLAY.

Behind her, TREY - the Navigation Officer - sits at a back-
lit NAVIGATION DISPLAY.
17.

CASSIE
Wow.

TREY doesn’t look around. He is deep engrossed in
calculations and readings.

CASSIE .
Trey. You want to see something? .

No response.

CASSIE
Trey!
TREY
(distracted)
What?
CASSIE

Do you want to see something?
TREY looks around.

CASSIE
Come here. Look.

TREY stands and walks over, and looks where CASSIE is
indicating...

see at the portal, which shows the sun, and the clutter of
the HUD display.

TREY
What am I supposed to be seeing?
The radiation level? Hull
temperature?

CASSIE
No.

She hits a few switches, and the HUD display vanishes...

CASSIE
There.

«++ revealing, against one curve of the sun, a silhouetted
sphere.

Some way distant - a planet.

CASSIE
Mercury.
18.

CLOSE IN on the view of MERCURY through the portal.

EXT. -RCURY

Stunning views of the sun-blasted planet...
«+. in space...

+-» illuminated by the sun...

+++ then MERCURY and ICARUS II and the SUN behind.

INT. COMMS CENTER

HARVEY sits in his chair, dozing with his chin on his chest..
We notice HARVEY has a few days stubble showing.

Over the speakers is the sound of the SOLAR WINDS.
Then, through the noise we hear:

Faintly, a steady series of regularly spaced tenes. On, off,
on, off.

CLOSE UP on HARVEY‘’S face.
Hearing the noise through his sleep...

+.. waking.

INT, BRIEFING ROOM
The crew is filing into the BRIEFING ROOM...

A plain room with a monitor screen on one wall, and a
conference table...

+++ where ASHER, SEARLE and HARVEY are already sat.
We notice that:

CAPA'S beard and hair are a longer, and he is more
bedraggled.

MACE has cut his hair very short.

CORAZON has earth and dirt embedded under her fingernails,
into her fingerprints.
19.

SEARLE is wearing sunglasses with extremely dark black-out
lenses, and his skin is reddened and peeling slightly.

ASHER and SEARLE wait in silence while the others take their
seats...

++» and when they have taken their seats, ASHER stands.

ASHER
Okay.

ASHER takes another moment as they settle.

ASHER

Okay - here it is. As you are all
aware, we’ve just entered orbit
with Mercury, where we will be
making a single full pass in order
to make use of the planet’s gravity
as a sling-shot velocity boost for
the final leg.

(beat)
You will also be aware that we have
now been out of all communication
with moon stations for fifty six
days.

ASHER turns to HARVEY.

ASHER
Harvey - you want to pick this up?

HARVEY nods.

HARVEY
Twenty three hours ago, while
making a routine check of the comms
systems...

MACE laughs dryly.
MACE
While listening to your space
music.
HARVEY ignores this.
HARVEY
++. While scanning the frequencies,
I heard a transmission.

All react - including Mace.
20.

HARVEY
It was hard to filter through the
high background interference, but
after a little time and effort, I
Managed to clean it up.

(beat) -
Icarus. Please play the audio ts
file.

ICARUS

Yes, Harvey.
Over the speaker system, the AUDIO FILE begins to play.

As before, we hear the regularly spaced tones come through
the static and SOLAR WIND.

HARVEY
End file.

The AUDIO FILE stops.

MACE
What is it?

HARVEY
It’s the Icarus One. And that
sound is their distress beacon.

Stunned silence in the Briefing room. Then:

CASSIE
Jesus.
TREY
It’s impossible. It’s seven years
since...
a HARVEY

(cutting in)
It’s clearly not impossible because
you can hear the beacon with your
own ears.

CASSIE
Are you saying they’re alive?

ASHER
We don’t know.

CORAZON
But we know that they could be-
21.

All eyes on CORAZON.

CORAZON
Their oxygen is self-replenishing.
Water is recycled. They have all
the solar power they need.

MACE >
What about food? No way their
supplies could have lasted seven
years.

ASHER speaks again.

A beat.

ASHER
That depends. They had food
supplies to cover eight People for
three years. .

_ MACE
That's a four year shortfall. One
Hell of a diet.

ASHER
Only if you’re feeding eight. We
don’t know what happened to Icarus
One. There might have been an
accident. Or something else.
There might not have been eight
mouths to feed.

Then CAPA speaks for the first time.

CAPA
I have a question.
ASHER
Yes.
CAPA

Do we know where they are?

A glance between ASHER and SEARLE.

SEARLE
Well done, Capa. That is the
question.

ASHER
We do know. Yes.
22.

The monitor screen behind ASHER lights up, to show a graphic
of:

The SUN, MERCURY, and ICARUS II.

ASHER .
Icarus. Please plot our trajectory “
. following the sling-shot around

Mercury. .
The trajectory appears.

ASHER
Now plot the source of the Icarus
One beacon.

An icon appears between Mercury and the Sun. . It is close to -
but not on - the trajectory course. :

CASSIE
Oh my God. We’re going to pass
right by them.

ASHER
Within twenty or thirty thousand
miles.

CORAZON

We'll be. able to see them.

ASHER
Through the scope. Yes.

CASSIE'S eyes suddenly well up.

TREY
But...
_ SEARLE
(quick)
Yes?
TREY

Well - I’d need to look at all of
this pretty carefully. Very
carefully. But... if I had to make
a guess right now...

(takes a deep breath)
I’d say we could adjust our
trajectory. We could fly straight
to them.
All eyes

MACE
(fast, firm)
But. We are not going to.

on MACE.

MACE
Just to make it absolutely clear.
There is literally no way we are
going to do that.

All eyes still on MACE.

He scans the faces in front of him.
them are.

MACE

What? You want me to-spell it out?
We have a payload to deliver to the
heart of our nearest star. We are
delivering that payload because the
star is dying. And if it dies, we
all die. Everything dies. So that
is our mission. And there is
nothing - literally nothing - more
important than completing the
mission. End of story.

TREY
He's right.

MACE
What do you mean: ’He‘s right’? Of
course I’m ‘right’. Is anyone here
seriously thinking otherwise?

SEARLE
May I put a counter argument?
MACE
No!
SEARLE
Captain?
ASHER
Go ahead.
SEARLE

It would, of course, be absurd to
alter our course to assist the crew
of the Icarus One.

(MORE)

23.

And clearly, some of
 

Silence.

24.

SEARLE (cont'd)
Even if we knew that some or even
all of the crew still alive, their
lives are entirely expendable when
seen in the context of our mission.
As are our own lives.

MACE
Exactly! tS

SEARLE /
But. There is something on the
Icarus One that may be worth the
detour. As you pointed out, Mace,
we have a payload to deliver. ‘A’
payload, singular. And everything
about the delivery and
effectiveness of that payload is
entirely theoretical. Simply put,
we don’t know if it’s going to
work. But what we do know is this.

{beat)
If we had two payloads, we would
have two chances.

HARVEY
You’re assuming we'd be able to
pilot Icarns One.

SEARLE
Yes.

TREY
Which is assuming that whatever
stopped them completing the miséion
wasn’t a fault or damage to the
spaceship.

SEARLE
Yes.

MACE
That’s a lot of assumptions.

- SEARLE
It is. It’s a risk assessment.
The question is, does the risk of
the detour outweigh the benefits of
an extra payload.

MACE glances around the table.
25.

CASSIE eyes are shining with tears for the crew of ICARUS
ONE.

HARVEY, TREY and CORAZON are with MACE.

ASHER is unreadable.

SEARLE is behind shades. . io
CAPA is undecided. ,

MACE
We'll have a vote.

SEARLE
No. We won’t. Because we aren't a
democracy. We're a collection of
astronauts and scientists. So we
will make the most informed
decision available to us.

MACE
Made by you, by any chance?

ASHER
Made by the person best qualified
to understand the complexities of
the payload delivery. In this
instance, our physicist.

All look to CAPA.
CAPA

(under his breath)
Shit.

INTs RECREATION ROOM

CAPA stands alone in the RECREATION ROOM, in front of a
billiard table.

The table is empty except for TWO WHITE CUE BALLS, positioned
at the top end of the table, next to each other.

Taking the cue, CAPA bends down and takes...

++. an ambitious shot with the first CUE BALL coming off
three cushions, eventually rolling towards the BOTTOM RIGHT
POCKET. .

And the ball misses by a fraction. It rattles a little in
the jaws, and doesn’t drop.
26.

CAPA looks at the second CUE BALL, blank-faced.

INT. CAPA’S BUNK
CAPA lies in his’bunk, frosted privacy partition pulled down.

He is wide awake, staring atthe ceiling just a metre above
his nose.

Attached to the ceiling is a hologram-photo of his pet dog,
MAXWELL.

On the frame of the hologram-photo is a single red button.
CAPA presses it.

Noiselessly, MAXWELL BARKS and WAGS HIS TAIL.

At that moment -

~ a figure appears behind the frosted partition, and suddenly
the partition slides up.

Revealing MACE behind it, his face twisted in fury.

MACE
You stupid fu-

The ICARUS II, flying fast away from the planet MERCURY.

INT. OXYGEN GARDEN

CAPA stands in the ferns, gazing into the foliage, thousand
yard stare.

He thinks he is alone.
But he isn’t. A few feet away, CASSIE is watching him.
Something - intuition - makes him turn, and he sees her.

CAPA
Hey.
27.

CASSIE
Hey.
(beat)
I just wanted to let you know, I
think you made the right choice.

CAPA
Mace doesn’t. And I’m guessing ~
Harvey and Trey don’t either.

CASSIE shrugs.

CASSIE
But I do.

cur T0:

NT. GI

CAPA and CASSIE are making love in an area of the Oxygen
Garden.

It’s passionate - but seems very much led and controlled by
CASSIE rather than CAPA.

A noise in the foliage distracts CAPA.

He breaks off from a kiss and turns to check the source of
the noise.

He can’t see anything or anyone there.

CASSIE puts a hand on his cheek and directs him back to her

CAPA breaks away again.

CAPA

She silences him with her kiss, and CAPA relents.

The atmosphere in the MESS is very subdued, and not all crew

CASSIE is standing by the food dispenser, filling her tray.

CORAZON and HARVEY sit together, and, separated by the four
empty places, are ASHER and CAPA.

CAPA watches CASSIE get her food.
When she turns, she sees his gaze, and gives him a smile.

It’s bright and friendly, but has a subtle blankness that is
not missed by CAPA.

The moment is not resolved, because suddenly, abruptly, an
ALARM is sounding.

ICcARUS
All flight crew report immediately

A frozen beat - then suddenly everyone is jumping to their
feet and running for the door.

TREY checking a HOLOGRAM SCHEMATIC of the ICARUS II.

ASHER

Enough! Everyone just take a

The fact is, we’re still alive. A
hole hasn’t burned in the side of
the ship, and we don’t have a ten
thousand degree climate. So how
bad is this? What’s the actual
damage?

Behind MACE is the HOLOGRAM SCHEMATIC.

MACE
We don’t know. Icarus tried to
feset the shield independently when
the alarm triggered. But all the
sensors up there burned out, so we
have no idea of the state of the
affected area.

The only way we’re going to find
out is to go out there.

ASHER and CAPA suit up.
We can see it impossible to put the suits on alone. In
gravity, the suits are too bulky and awkward in the gravity
ef the spaceship.
It is necessary to be assisted.
ASHER is assisted ‘by HARVEY, CAPA by CASSIE.
Every part of the suit is made of a strange mirrored material
- every surface reflects, causing strange distortions where
the stiff suit material is rippled or folded.

CASSIE

You've been through this a thousand
times in Barth orbit training.

CAPA
(tight, scared)
Yeah.
CASSIE

You're going to be fine.
CAPA nods.

He’s looking straight into CASSIE’S eyes like he wants her to
say-something else.

Something personal, or...
Clunk.

The heavy mirrored helmet is dropped over CAPA'’S head and a
suck of pressurised air locks the rim into place...

+--+ leaving a reflection of CASSIE’S face where CAPA’S had
been.

CASSIE locks the helmet in to place by putting her hand
either side of the helmet and pulling down sharply,
activating locking clasps around the neck ring.

CAPA

ASHER
Well - let’s see.

ASHER moves over to one of the half~upright scales - which
gives us a clear sense of proportion of the size of the ship,
as the scale is as tall as he is - and takes out a tool from
a utility pouch on his suit.

Like everything else, the tool is perfectly mirrored on every
surface.

CAPA watches as ASHER works on the scale.
ASHER cuts or releases something.
The scale moves to a fully upright position.

This allows ASHER to manoeuvre the bulky space-suit to reach
--the mechanism underneath.

He works inside...

«.. then ASHER pushes himself backwards as slowly the huge
scale begins to return to the side of ICARUS II.

CLOSE UP on the cubicle screen, and PINBACKER.
PINBACKER
In fact, ultimately, I know it is
inevitable.
PINBACKER pauses.
PINBACKER
This is the truth you realise. The.
truth you must realise. The truth

you can only realise...

PINBACKER moves slightly, away from the camera.

53.

And where he was previously back-lit, now light falls on him

and reveals...

--. that his face is like a much advanced version of

SEARLE'S.

The skin is ravaged, cracked, split.

Spread across the surface are constellations of blisters and
melanomas, some burned to blackness, some bright red, open

and raw.
54.

only his eyes, and the skin around his eyes, white from the
protection of sunglasses, are undamaged.

INT, ICARUS I/COMMS ROOM
MACE'S face.

Stunned. Still absorbing the weirdness of what he has just
seen and heard.

Then ~

~- a sudden wrenching sound. Loud and freakish, like tearing
metal.

MACE
What the...?

And the next moment ~ the entire ship gives a sudden lurch.

MACE is knocked off balance, and is sent crashing sideways
into the wall and down to the floor.

MACE
Cassie! What’s going on?
NT. I DECK .
ICARUS II is lurching too.
_CASSIE is hitting buttons on the console, flicking switches.

Over the radio link we can hear the shouts of alarm of MACE,
HARVEY and SEARLE.

CASSIE
Get back to the airlock! All of
you! Get back!

CAPA
What is it? What’s happening?

CASSIE
Icarus! Stabilise us}
55.

ICARUS
Affirmative, Cassie.

CASSIE
(to Capa)
The airlock has just decoupled.
Get down there NOW!
. ICARI I
WE FOLLOW CAPA as he runs through ICARUS II to the airlock.

And when he reaches it...

INT. OUTSIDE AIRLOCK

Outside the airlock chamber, CAPA presses his face to the
glass.

He can see that the airlock door is open to outer space.

And he can see the airlock door of ICARUS I, which is also
open, and the reason for the sound of tearing metal we heard.

Around the door of ICARUS I the skin of the ship has been
ripped open, revealing the hull structure beneath.
Tf. ICARI I/OUTSIDE AIRLOCK

MACE is arriving at the airlock. SEARLE and HARVEY have
already made it there.

MACE
Cassie?
INT. FLIGHT DECK
CASSIE

The airlock has decoupled. We
don’t know why. Mace - the locking
system on Icarus I is ripped open.
We aren’t going to be able to dock
again.

iT. ICARU! ‘OUTSIDE AIRLOCK

MACE - thinking fast.
 

56.

HARVEY ~ close to panicking.

HARVEY
We're fucked.

MACE
No.

He looks to the MIRRORED SPACE SUITS.

MACE
Suit up.

A moment.
‘There are several suits, but...
HARVEY .
++. We can’t. Not all of us. Who
will lock the helmets?

Another moment - then both MACE and HARVEY turn to look at
SEARLE.

SEARLE
It seems I’11 be staying behind
then.
MACE
(simple, hard)
Agreed.

cur TO:

INT. ICARUS I/OUTSIDE AIRLOCK

HARVEY and MACE are both suited, except for the helmets.
SEARLE has HARVEY'S ready.

HARVEY can hardly meet SEARLE’S gaze.

HARVEY
Searle - I...

SEARLE
I know.

The helmet comes down over HARVEY, and SEARLE locks it down.

Leaving MACE.
57.

SEARLE takes the helmet over to MACE.

MACE looks straight into SEARLE’S eyes, meeting the gaze
evenly.

Something between them. Something about the fact that they
both know SEARLE is going to die.

And something about the power that SEARLE has over MACE at
that moment - if he refuses to lock the helmet.

“But neither say a word.

And the helmet goes down, and SEARLE locks it into place.

Int. ICARUS I/OUTSIDE AIRLOCK
SEARLE is gone. —
MACE and HARVEY are alone.
MACE
(over radio link)
Okay. We've got just one shot.
You ready for this?
HARVEY
(over radio link)
I’m ready.
HARVEY opens the door to the airlock.
Immediately, both men are sucked out, into the airlock...

+.. then ejected through the broken outer door of the
airlock, and into outer space.

EX?. ICARUS II

Silence as...

++. we watch MACE and HARVEY shoot out from ICARUS I, towards
ICARUS II...

.-. in the weightlessness of space, they have no control over
themselves.

They collide, and send each other spinning off course...

Some way distant from each other, they both slam into the
side of ICARUS II.
58.

The impact is shocking.
MACE has managed to hold on to the edge of a mirrored panel.
But HARVEY has not.

He has bounced off the hull at an odd angle, and is now
falling down the side of ICARUS II, towards MACE. ~

A STRANGE, SLOW SEQUENCE.
HARVEY is only a couple of metres from the side of the ship.

When he reaches out his hand, his fingertips are only an inch
from the side of the hull. :

But he is in zero gravity vacuum. ‘There is nothing he can do
to affect his trajectory. .

He twists. Stretches. Strains.
All to no effect.
He passes within a few feet of MACE.

If MACE were to relinquish his hold on the panel, he could
easily reach HARVEY.

But he doesn’t, and HARVEY floats by.

HARVEY continues on this nightmarish journey, down the entire
length of ICARUS II...

++. where we can see, once he moves past ICARUS II, he will
suddenly be unshielded from the sunlight.

cur TO:

INT. FLIGHT DECK

CASSIE and CORAZON are watching this, horrified, from
HARVEY’S helmet cam.

And worse, we can now hear what we couldn’t hear before.
HARVEY'S desperate screaming over the radio link.

CASSIE can't bear it. She lunges - switching the image off,
cutting out the screaming. .
59.

EXT. ICARUS
Back to silence again...

--- as HARVEY slips past ICARUS II, into the sunlight, and
burns up in an instant.

FADE 0:

INT. BRIEFING ROOM
CAPA, MACE, CASSIE and CORAZON sit in the briefing room.
The empty seats say everything they need to.
A long beat. Then:
CORAZON

If Trey dies, we'll have the oxygen

to make it to the delivery point.
INT. MESS

The four crew members eat. in silence.

INT. RECREATION ROOM
CAPA is in the recreation room.
He walks over to the chess board.

The pieces are laid out half way through a a game — abandoned
between him and ASHER.

He sits down and studies the board for a few moments.

Then he tips over the white king.

Another moment passes. :

Then CAPA suddenly lashes out and sweeps his hand violently

across the board, scattering the pieces across the room.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
CAPA opens the door of the observation room,

The brightness is amazingly intense.
60.

CAPA buckles over, shielding his face with both arms.

CAPA
Icarus! Reset! Reset!

The light lowers.

INT. MED CENTER

CAPA stands leoking in to TREY’S glass cubicle.
TREY is asleep, but clearly having a nightmare.
CAPA sees something reflected in the glass.

CAPA looks around - and startles.

MACE is there, behind him, also looking in at TREY.

CAPA composes himself.

MACE
Wondering whether to kill him?
CAPA
No.
MACE
Me neither. I’m wondering how to
kill him.
A beat.
MACE
Joke.
CAPA
Right.

CAPA turns back to TREY.

CAPA
Mace - have you been to the
observation room since...

MACE
We lost Searle? No. Why?

CAPA
Just ~ the light level was
ineredibly high.
61.

MACE
It must have been the level Searle
left it.

INT. COMMS CENTER
CAPA is in the COMMS CENTER.
In the cubicle, he is talking to SEARLE.

The image is poor. The sound is distorted, and through it we
can hear the solar wind.

CAPA
We're going to come back for you,
Searle. After the payload. On the
return journey.

SEARLE
You aren’t going to have a return
journey.
CAPA ignores this.
CAPA

You have to try to orientate the
hull breach away from the sun.
It’s the only way the ship will
survive.

SEARLE
Capa - let me ask you something.
Why do you think survival is so
important? Why do we give it such
a high premium? °
(beat)
I’m no longer interested in
— survival. I have other plans.

CAPA
ae. What plans?

SEARLE
To die in the epicentre of a
stellar fission bomb explosion.
The image is lost suddenly.

Then returns a few moments later.
62-

SEARLE
I’m giving you enough time to make
sufficient distance from the
detonation. I think a few million
miles should do it.
The image is going again.
The sound distorting.
Before it goes completely...
SEARLE .
It’s true, Capa. What Pinbacker
said.

It’s gone.

INT. ICARUS I/COMMS ROOM

SEARLE looks at a frozen distortion of CAPA’S face.
The only sound is static and solar wind.

Phen the image goes completely.

SEARLE is utterly alone.

He looks at his digital watch.

Int. I DI

SEARLE sits at the flight deck. -

He hits a button.

A string of numbers flash up on the HUD: 57600.00
SEARLE hits another button.

The string of numbers starts counting down.

SEARLE sets his digital watch to match the countdown.

NT. I zr ss
SEARLE sits in the Mess.

We see at once he has a few days beard growth.
63.
He has a plate of yellow food paste and a glass of water.

He eats his meal quietly, unhurried.

iT. ICARUS I/OXYGEN GARDEN
SEARLE’S beard now shows a fortnight of growth. a
He is trimming back dead fern fronds.

The garden looks well tended and under control.

NT. ICARI I/PA’ SA

SEARLE, with several weeks. of beard growth, opens the doors
of a huge hanger. We haven’t been here before, on: either
ICARUS I or II. .

It is the payload bay.

And in the middle of the bay is the STELLAR FISSION BOMB.
The BOMB is a CUBE,

Smooth, featureless, . flawless.

Each of its sides are MIRRORED.

+--+ and each of its sides are the length of a football pitch.
SEARLE stands before it, completely dwarfed by the size.
SEARLE checks his watch.

The number is 00006.12

SEARLE walks up to the FISSION BOMB and presses it.

He has triggered a hidden door on the smooth surface, which
opens.

Inside there is only darkness.
SEARLE steps inside, and the door closes behind him,
returning to the featureless mirror it was before.

INT. ICARUS I/INSIDE THE BOMB

Darkness.
64.

Then a light - from a glow-stick lamp in SEARLE'S hands.

SEARLE is faintly illuminated, but still surrounded by total
darkness.

SEARLE walks.

Then stops, and sits cross-legged on the floor.
He checks his watch a last time.

The countdown is at 00000.07

The last seven seconds pass.

The timer runs out.

--- And for a few moments, nothing happens.

Then, in the middle of the chamber, directly above where
SEARLE sits, a single SPARK appears in the air.

It fizzes and pops, but remains in roughly the same location,
moving like a firefly.

Then, suddenly, the SPARK splité into TWO SPARKS.
SEARLE‘S FACE - his expression is pure delight.
The fizzing SPARKS double again to four...

Then four to eight, then sixteen, then thirty two, sixty
four...

++. and suddenly the SPARKS are multiplying with exponential
speed.

cur TO:

EXT. ICARUS IT
ICARUS II flies through dark space.

Seconds later, behind ICARUS II, there is the biggest
explosion in Science Fiction history.

For a moment, it as if a new sun has been born.
Then, almost as fast as it came into being, the fabric of the

small star begins to split and pull itself apart, and
dissipate...

CAPA, MACE, CASSIE and CORAZON stand in the med center.
They looking in at TREY’S cubicle. .

TREY is dead.
His wrists are cut.
Blood is everywhere.
On the wall, before his death, he has written...
THE FACE OF GOD

CAPA
(quietly angry)
Who did it?
Silence from the others.
CAPA
Come on ~ we all know he didn’t
wake up and cut his wrists. We all
know it was one of us. So which
one? Who was it?

MACE
Shut up, Capa.

CAPA
It was you?

MACE
No - it wasn’t me.

CAPA
Was it you, Cassie?

CASSIE doesn’t answer. And she seems too shattered by TREY’S
death to have been the killer.

CAPA turns to CORAZON.
66.

CORAZON
Don’t fucking look at me.

CAPA keeps looking at her.
CORAZON
Don’t look at me! I didn’t doa vs

It’s better that he’s dead! So TI
don’t care if he cut his wrists or

-She looks around at the others.

CORAZON
Right?

No response.
CORAZON
Right?
INT. MESS
CAPA walks into the MESS.

Only CASSIE is there, sitting alone, with a plate of
untouched food in front of her.

She’s lost in her thoughts and doesn’t look round when he
enters.

CAPA fills a glass of water for himself and goes to sit
opposite her.

He wants to say something to her...

+++ but he doesn’t know what.

He just sits there, holding his glass of water.
A few seconds later, CASSIE gets up and leaves.

She hadn’t looked at him once. It was as if he wasn’t there.

INT. CAPA’S Bi

CAPA lies in bed, awake, in shorts and T-shirt, staring at
the ceiling.

He hears a noise.
He slides open his privacy partition.

Over the other side of the SLEEPING QUARTERS, CAPA can see
CASSIE’S BUNK.

Behind the frosted partition, we can see there are two
figures inside.

It’s MACE and CASSIE, discernable through the frosted glass,
having sex each other.

CAPA watches them a few moments.

INT. CORRIDOR/OUTSIDE OBSERVATION ROOM

CAPA is walking down a corridor in his shorts and T-shirt.
He stops at the door to the observation room.

He opens the door...

++. and is bathed in blinding light.

The level in the observation room has been reset again.

CAPA
Jesus, Icarus! Turn it down!

ICARUS
Yes, Capa.

The lights comes down to a dull glow.

CAPA steps inside.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

CAPA sits on the observation sofa, and looks at the sun.

It’s a dull orange glow. And it’s huge. Taking up most of
the observation room portal.
68.

We haven’‘t realised until now how close they are to reaching
the star.

For a few moments, CAPA watches the solar flares explode
outwards from the boiling surface.

Then: “>

CAPA
How long to go, Icarus?:

No answer.

Unusual - ICARUS has always responded immediately to all
questions.

CAPA
Icarus?

ICARUS
Yes, Capa.

CAPA
How long to go?

ICARUS
Please rephrase the question. How
long to go until what?

CAPA
Until we reach the payload delivery
point.

ICARUS

The payload delivery point will be
reached in seven days.

CAPA
Seven days. A week. After nearly
twenty months.

Jesus. Put like that, I’m almost
glad.

ICARUS
Glad of what, Capa?

CAPA
Glad we don’t have the oxygen to

a one-way trip. I don’t think I'd
be able to stand the return
journey.

ICARUS
That is true, Capa. It will bea

CAPA
Not for you necessarily. You can

CAPA
Why not? No point in floating here
for another ten billion years.
Ride the solar winds and take our
bodies back. Give our families a.
bunch of bones to bury.

ICARUS
Negative. I will not be able to
make the return journey and deliver
your corpses. I will be piloting
the stellar fission bomb into the

CAPA
+++ What?

ICARUS
I will be piloting the stellar...

CAPA
Yes. Copy. Why?

ICARUS
Directive one: deliver the payload.
Directive two: ensure crew's
survival on outward journey in
order to safeguard against computer
malfunction and system error and
unforeseen circumstances.
Directive three: if the crew do not
survive the outward journey, Icarus
II will deliver the payload itself.

CAPA
++. But why are you saying we won’t
survive the outward journey?

CAPA ( cont'd)
You just told me, there’s only
seven days left.

In the observation room.

Pull back to reveal, BEHIND CAPA, a dark figure.

In the gloom we can’t see him clearly, but we know who it is.
We've seen the silhouette before.

.

PINBACKER.

And as CAPA whirls around, rising off the sofa, PINBACKER is
swiping something through the air.

A length of something. A metal bar.

It hits CAPA around the side of the head, and CAPA is send
crashing to the floor.

Dazed, he scrambles backwards.
He looks up.

PINBACKER is there, about to bring the bar down in a killing
blow.

CAPA raises his hands just in time, and the bar connects
sickeningly on CAPA'S arm.

CAPA screams in pain.
PINBACKER raises the bar again.

Iearus! Full sunlight!

SUNLIGHT fills the room - bleaching everything to whiteness.

INT. CORRIDOR/OUTSIDE OBSERVATION ROOM

The corridor outside the observation room.

The door to the observation room opens, and LIGHT floods out.
On his hands and knees, CAPA scrambles out.

He’s bleeding from the side of his head.

He tries to get up.

He trips - falls sideways.
 

72.

He’s blinking, tears streaming from his eyes, temporarily
half-blinded. .

He picks himself up, and stumbling, arms outstretched, starts
to run.

He runs out of shot... : os
MOMENTS LATER
PINBACKER steps out of the observation room.

He stands a moment in the blaze - upright, back-lit by the
SUNLIGHT from the open observation room.

A biackened silhouette shape.

The door behind him closes.

And now we can see two things about him.
One - PINBACKER is naked.

Two - where the SUNLIGHT had been blazing against his back,
the skin is not steaming but smoking.

Even burning. Tiny flames lick on the edges of crusts of
skin, that glow like coal embers, or miniature lava streams.

Unconcerned by what must be immeasurable pain, PINBACKER
turns in the direction CAPA fled, and gives chase.

INT. CORRIDOR

CAPA runs.

He looks behind him - and sees PINBACKER’S black, smoking
figure running after him.

CAPA ducks through a door.

INT. AIRLOCK

CAPA has run into the AIRLOCK.
A total dead end.

Panic on CAPA’S face.

CAPA turns and sees PINBACKER entering the airlock.
 

73.

CAPA lunges for a panel -

~- and the glass interior pressure door slides shut, sealing
CAPA in the AIRLOCK, and PINBACKER on the other side.

PINBACKER stops at the door.
Checks it. >
Tries to open it.
ICARUS
Access denied. Interior pressure
door is manually locked from the
other side.

A moment, as PINBACKER and CAPA face each other through the
glass... :

--- and we see the PINBACKER’S face clearly for the first
time since we saw him on the broadcast.

In comparison with before, PINBACKER’S skin is so sun-damaged
and eaten with melanomas we can hardly recognise him.

The moment is held.
Then:

PINBACKER lifts his hand and presses the panel on his side of
the door.

Then:

PINBACKER turns, and leaves.

A beat.
oo CAPA
Yeah! That’s it! Can’t get me,

Silence.

CAPA peers through the glass.
PINBACKER definitely seems to have gone.
Cautiously, CAPA presses the panel on his side of the door.

And nothing happens.

Fuck! FUCK! FU-

cur fo REVERSE SIDE of glass, where CAPA rages and punches
the glass in total silence.

CAPA exhausts himself.
Then - sees, inside the airlock, the mirrored space suits.
SILENT SEQUENCE

«++ almost comic as CAPA puts on the bulky space suit,
struggling against its weight and clumsiness...

‘,.. until only the helmet is left to fit - which, as has been
established, can’t be locked down by one man alone.

CAPA puts the helmet over his head anyway.

We see him trying to reach his hands up to the locking
mechanism - but it is impossible.

Even if CAPA was strong enough to cope with the weight of the
suit in gravity, the material of the suit won’t allow such
flexibility for him to reach up to the side of helmet.

CAPA stops a moment, propped up against the side of the
airlock.

He is gathering strength for one last effort...
75.

Then he lowers his head like a bull about to charge...
.«»- and hurls himself at the opposite airlock wall...
..- Head-butting the wall as hard as he can.

Even is silence, the impact looks horrible.

CAPA falls to the floor.

Then sits up.

The tactic has worked. The helmet is attached.

CORAZON looks up at CAPA on the other side of the geodesic

CORAZON
Icarus - what exactly is Capa doing
on the outside of the spaceship?

ICARUS

Capa was unable to open the airlock

CAPA begins to gesticulate wildly.

And CORAZON doesn’t understand.

CORAZON looks up at CAPA, shaking her head slightly.
CORAZON
(to herself)

That’s it. It’s official. He has

totally lost the plot.
And behind her, PINBACKER is getting nearer.
Walking steadily, relaxed, no apparent need for stealth...

CAPA is gesticulating like crazy.
CORAZON lifts her hand and gives CAPA a cheery wave.

He sweating - looks scared.

He’s moving stealthily.

Gripped fiercely in his hand is the broken bottle neck.
CAPA reaches the door to the PAYLOAD BAY.

The door opens.

CAPA slips inside.

INT. PAYLOAD BAY
Similar to the PAYLOAD BAY of ICARUS I.

Cavernous, and in the middle is the vast mirrored cube of the
STELLAR FISSION BOMB.

CAPA stands motionless.

Standing further into the PAYLOAD BAY is MACE.
 

 

 

81.

His arms hang by his sides.
His back is to CAPA.
It is unclear what MACE is doing, or looking at.
CAPA
(hisses) 7
«ee Mace!
MACE doesn’t respond.
CAPA
(louder)
Mace!
Now MACE reacts.
He turns, slowly.
And we see his chest is soaked in blood.
Then he collapses.

CAPA
Mace?

A noise from above.

CAPA looks up to the WALKWAY COMPLEX that stretches across
the top of the hanger...

»-. and sees a figure on one of the walkways.
But it’s not PINBACKER.
It’s CASSIE.
And-she’s pointing the HANDGUN straight at him.
CAPA
(calls out)
Cassie!
She fires.
A single shot - which misses.
Stunned, CAPA scurries for cover.
CAPA

{shouts )
What are you doing?
 

 

 

82.

CASSIE
(out of sight, shouting
from the walkway)
Stay away from me!

CAPA
But it's me! Capa!

CASSIE
Murderer! °

Another shot rings out.

CAPA
I didn’t kill anyone! You've
killed Mace!

: CASSIE
And I’11 kill you too! I’m past
taking fucking chances! One of you
murdered Trey and Corazon!

Another shot.

CAPA
Cassie - stop! You don’t
understand! It wasn’t either of
sus!

CASSIE
(screams )
I don't believe you!

CAPA
(screams back) a
It was Pinbacker!

Silence from above.

Silence.

Silence.

CAPA
It was the captain of the Icarus
One! He got on board while we were

docked!

CAPA
He was the one who decoupled the
airlocks.
 

 

83.

CAPA
Cassie?

CAPA looks around - and sees a ladder leading up to the
walkways.

INT. PAYLOAD BAY/LADDER  - ~
CAPA climbs the ladder up.

He is halfway up when he hears a muffled shout and then the
clatter of metal on metal.

He looks around to see...

+.- spinning through the air, falling down to the bottom of
the Payload Bay, the HANDGUN.

CAPA
(yells)
Cassie!

INT. PAYLOAD BAY/WALKWAYS

CAPA reaches the top of the ladder, and swings around to
stand on the narrow walkway.

Where he sees...

++. a strange sight.

PINBACKER stands on the walkway, with his hand outstretched.
Holding’on to his hand, leaning back at ‘an angle, is CASSIE.

It is only PINBACKER’S grip that is preventing CASSIE from
falling backwards.

For a moment, the two stand on the edge of the walkway -—
CASSIE held from falling by PINBACKER’S grip.

Their gazes are locked.

Then CASSIE makes a slight movement backwards - a slight
slip.

And she sees: something weird and initially inexplicable - a
band of bright redness around PINBACKER’S upper arm.

Expanding...

84.

Yhen suddenly, it becomes explicable.

PINBACKER’S skin is sloughing off his arm like a long black
glove...

CASSIE screams.

+». then CASSIE is falling, taking the glove with her,
tumbling into space...

+-- dropping the entire height of the PAYLOAD BAY...
++. until she slams into the floor and is killed outright.

PINBACKER turns to CAPA, his arm now as red and slick as a
skinned rabbit.

CAPA starts backing away, warding PINBACKER off with his
bottle-neck weapon.

PINBACKER continues to advance.
But the walkway only leads one way.

To the...

iT. PA’ BAY/STELLAR FISSION BOMB
+s. top side of the STELLAR FISSION BOMB.
The two men now stand on top of the BOMB.

Blood from PINBACKER’S skinned arm leaves a trail of droplets
on the mirrored surface as he advances on CAPA.

On the mirrored surface, with his bloody arm and ravaged skin
and bright eyes...

+--+ he no longer looks like he was ever human.
He looks like a DEMON.

And this may be why - when they have reached the middle of
the vast cube - CAPA stops...

.--+ and his bottle-neck weapon slips from his fingers, as if
conceding its uselessness.

And he drops to his knees.

PINBACKER - possibly surprised by the gesture of prayer -
also stops.
85.

CAPA’S head is bowed.

A moment passes.

Then his shoulders begin to shake.
We realise he is crying.

A few more moments pass.

CAPA
I know you’re going to kill me.
You killed everyone else. How can
I stop you? I’m no good at
fighting. I’m a physicist, for
Christ’s sake. I never won a fight
in my fucking life.

He wipes his nose with his sleeve, leaving a silvery trail of
snot.

CAPA
I don’t really understand. TI don’t
really understand what’s happening
here at all.
CAPA looks up at the DEMONIC MAN.
CAPA
Are you from Hell? Is that it?
Have we flown too near the sun and
disturbed the angels, or angered
them, or...
A beat.

CAPA
What is the face of God?

This was the question to ask.
PINBACKER’S head tilts to the side.
Then he opens his mouth to speak.

PINBACKER hasn’t spoken since he made the recording on ICARUS
I.

The movement to his jaw causes his skin to rupture and split
horrifically...

+--+ and the damaged sound of his voice seems to echo the
damage to his body.
oop a

86.

PINBACKER
You mean to...

PINBACKER breaks off. Perhaps halted by the pain of

speaking.

. Then he continues.

PINBACKER
You mean to ask, what is God? If
you look at God, you see his face.

: CAPA ;
Okay. Yes. That is what I mean.
What is God?

PINBACKER ;
God is what gave us life and God is
what will take it away. God is the
sun.

CAPA
The sun?

CAPA shakes his head, not understanding. Almost getting

angry.

A moment.

CAPA
But... then why are you trying to
stop us? The sun is dying. Why
won’t you let us save it? .

PINBACKER -
Do you know the distance between
here and the next nearest star?

CAPA
One point six light years.

PINBACKER
One point six light years. No
matter what mankind does, no matter
how far we develop or evolve, we
will never reach that star. The
distances are simply to great.

PINBACKER smiles.
87.

PINBACKER
And even if we could overcome that
impossibility, we would still only
be delaying the inevitable.
Because just as our sun died, so
would the next, and the next.
Until eventually, there would be no
more suns to harvest, and we'd be .
right back where we are now.
Facing extinction. Confronting the
only real truth.

PINBACKER pauses.
And we - and CAPA - see something that PINBACKER does not.

Standing behind him - battered, bleeding, clutching a hand to
his -chest with one hand, but still alive - is MACE.

And in MACE’S other hand, he’s holding CASSIE’S gun.
MACE is trying to raise the gun. Weakly. Slowly.
CAPA stalls for more time.

CAPA
What truth?

PINBACKER
That all this effort to survive is
wasted. It’s not in our destiny to
survive. It’s not even in our
nature.

As PINBACKER talks, the gun is being raised higher.

PINBACKER
None of us do it. Not our parents.
— Not our children. Not the fishes,
or the birds, or the trees. Not
even God.

And now, the gun is levelled at the back of PINBACKER’S head.

PINBACKER
The only thing in our nature is to
die.

MACE
Okay.

PINBACKER'S eyes flick to the side.

MACE
Then die.

PINBACKER turns.
Looks at MACE, at the gun barrel...
«+. then shrugs. .

PINBACKER -
By all means.

MACE fires.

PINBACKER is shot in the face.

The back of his head flies off, and he folds to the floor.
Dead.

MACE slumps to his knees. The gun drops out of his hand.

MACE
What...

He’s running out of breath. He tries again.

MACE
What... was all that about?

A beat.
CAPA
I don't know. I was just trying to
keep him talking so I could figure
out what to do next.

FADE TO:

INT. FLIGHT DECK
MACE is bandaged.
CAPA is beside him.

Both are looking in at the compartment which holds ICARUS’S
memory banks.

They are destroyed, in the same manner as the destruction of
the computer on ICARUS I.
89.

MACE
He really did a number on her.
She’s not going back together,
that’s for sure.
CAPA
How are we going to fly the
remaining distance? ~
MACE °
As your pilot, I don't foresee a
problem.

MACE looks towards the cockpit display. The sun occupies the
entire monitor.

MACE
It’s not like we’re going to get
lost. .

FADE TO:

INT. FLIGHT DECK

MACE sits in the pilot’s seat, working the console.
CAPA is in the copilot’s seat...

++. Capa is setting the countdown timer.

Countdown numbers appear on the screen.

They read: 08640.05

FADE TO:

INT AIRLOCK

Wrapped in shrouds, four bodies wait in the airlock, in a
row, on the floor.

CASSIE, TREY, CORAZON, and PINBACKER.

CAPA and MACE stand on the other side of the pressurised
glass airlock door.

A few seconds later, the outer airlock door opens, and the
bodies are ejected in the rush of escaping air.
 

90.

EXT. ICARUS IT

The bodies tumble out into space, and burn into nothingness
almost at once.

We see that the ICARUS II has virtually reached the sun.

FADE TO:

INT. DARK ROOM

In a dark room, CAPA and MACE sit staring at the chess board.
They, and the chess board, are illuminated by a lamp.

The pieces are all set up to play. Neither have yet moved.
B long beat.

Eventually, CAPA reaches over to MACE’S side of the board and
moves his WHITE KING’S PAWN two spaces.

CAPA

That’s the most common first move.
MACE

Oh. Right.

(beat)
Yeah, I’1l do that then.

CAPA neds, then moves his BLACK KING’S PAWN to counter.
Back to silence as MACE studies the board. -
Until eventually...
a CAPA
Mace - I really don't think you
have long enough to learn how to
play chess.
MACE looks crestfallen.
MACE
+.- But I always wanted to learn.
What other chance am I going to
have?

CAPA thinks about this.
91.

CAPA
Okay.

Pause.

CAPA
So, why don’t you see if your
bishop or knight could be S
developed?

.

At that moment, above CAPA’S head, a single fizzing, popping,
firefly SPARK appears.

CAPA looks up to watch it.
MACE does not. He is too engrossed in the board.

MACE
Okay. How about this?

MACE moves one of his knights.
The SPARK doubles to two.
CAPA

Yeah. That’s a good move...
You‘re getting the hang.

FADE TO:
BLACK SCREEN
CAPTION:
8 Minutes Later
FADE UP TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

A park in the middle of a city.

A DOG is being taken for a walk by an WOMAN.

We have seen the DOG before, on a hologram-photo: MAXWELL.

By the light levels, we would estimate the time is either
late afternoon or early morning.

The WOMAN throws a ball, and MAXWELL runs after it...

+++ over the grass, to where the ball is bouncing.

He picks it up in his teeth...

«-- and as he does so, the light levels all seems to
change...

++. brightening.

No more dramatic than when the sun appears from behind a
cloud.

MAXWELL looks up at the sky for a moment.

Then, with the ball still in his teeth, he starts running
back towards the WOMAN.
