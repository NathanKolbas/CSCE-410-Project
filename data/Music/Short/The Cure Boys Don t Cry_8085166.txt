1 EXT - DESERTED HIGHWAY - NIGHT (DREAM)

Black and dreamy. The sky goes on forever. The highway
bends with the earth's curve, as though inside a paperweight.

2 INT - VINTAGE CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT (DREAM)

BRANDON, 20, boyish, handsome in a CHICAGO WHITE SOX JACKET,
races forward. His eyes scan the approaching road - yellow
lines and glistening asphalt. Indeterminate elements of
cities, night landscapes out of time. Stars are coming down.

BRANDON watches intensely. Steam billows up around hin.

A girl with blonde hair, her face obscured by darkness, sits
beside him. He pulls her close and points to the passing
landscapes. A white dust gathers on the horizon. He checks
the rear view mirror, then speeds up. Dust enters the car.

TITLE: FALLS CITY, NEBRASKA, December 1993
3 INT - RESTAURANT KITCHEN ~- NIGHT

Steam. Brandon's eyes. RESTAURANT SOUNDS. Brandon pulls
from the reverie. Reveal he is TEENA, an androgynous teen,
washing pans in scalding hot water at an enormous sink. She
looks at the clock - second hand's barely moving. As she
leans back for a breather, a bus boy drops a load of dishes.

TITLE: LINCOLN, NEBRASKA, October, 1992
EXT/ INT - TRAILER (LIVING ROOM, KITCHEN, BEDROOM) -NIGHT

FOLLOW as a disheveled Teena stumbles in and through. She
comes upon JOANN, her mom, 37 and JOANN’s BOYFRIEND, 32,
illuminated by the TV’s glow. They turn her way.

BOYFRIEND
Going out on a hot date, stud?

JOANN
(to boyfriend)
Stop that.
(to Teena)
Hi honey, was work ok?

Still moving, Teena nods, pauses in the KITCHEN, for some
milk and moves toward her BEDROOM.

JOANN
Tammy called, she wants to know if
you can watch Jake Saturday night.

Teena nods, enters her BEDROOM, shuts the door and lies on
the bed staring at the ceiling. Music, laughing, sounds of
a party filter in. A knock at the door.

MOM (0.S.)
We’ re going to Lucy’s party. Wanna
come?

TEENA
Nah, that’s ok, I’ll catch ya later.
Thanks.

They leave. Teena sits up and watches through the window as
her mom and the boyfriend disappear into a crowd of couples.

Teena pulls a bag out from under the bed, opens it - a nicely
wrapped western shirt.

EXT - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA STREETS - NIGHT

Cruising by rows of candy-colored trailers into the downtown
district. Teena strains to see herself. She’s wearing the
new western shirt. She looks like a BOY. Seeing three
college girls, "he" flattens his shirt.

TEENA
(to himself/deep voice)
Hey...(it pops high) Hey.

They cross. He slows, stops, then rolls down the window.
TEENA
(nervously)
Hey! You need a ride somewhere?
One girl reaches for the door until she gets a better look.
GIRL
You gotta be kidding. No offense.
But - the dyke bar’s -(she laughs)

Teena restarts the car and pulls away, watching the girls
disappear in the rear view mirror.

EXT - BRANDON'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Teena carries the balled up shirt, and makes her way to the
party. She’s about to go on when her mom waves her in. She
follows, grabs a beer and stands dazed, watching ~ people at

picnic - talking and dancing, her mom and boyfriend laughing.
A cordless phone rings. She picks up.

Hello? No, I’m sorry. I think you

She hangs up and watches a beautiful girl dance. SLOW on
the girl. The phone rings again. She picks up again.

TEENA
Hello.

A pause, then a girl's voice.

HEATHER (0.S.)
Oh. Hi! I called a minute ago.
Wrong number.

TEENA
I remember.

HEATHER (0.S.)
Ok...I just wanted to say - you sound
really cute - what’s your name?

A realization. A wave of excitement. Teena speaks quietly.
7 INT - TEENA’S TRAILER - NIGHT
NERVOUS LAUGHTER. Sound of scissors.
TEENA

Yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s it. Right.

Better.
LONNY, 24, MIDWEST QUEERBOY, Teena’s cousin cuts Teena’s
hair. They've been drinking. Teena indicates Lonny take

more off the side. Lonny makes a last cut. Teena goes for
the mirror. Lonny stops her.

LONNY
If you was a guy, I might even wanna
fuck you.

TEENA
You mean if you was a guy you’d wanna
fuck me.

LONNY

Yeah, Yeah. OK superstar.

Lonny spins her around and hands her the mirror. Teena is
“BRANDON,” the boy from the beginning. Stunned, he looks at
himself from one angle then another. He looks down.

BRANDON
(bursts out laughing)
Lonny, man it looks like a deformity.

Brandon removes a sock from his pants, replaces it with one
half the size. He looks to a picture of Sean Penn from Teen
Beat, on the dresser, to a poster of Matt Dillon on the wall,
to Matt’s bulge, to Lonny’s, and then readjusts his own.

LONNY
(a little drunk)
OK, you’re a boy, now what?
Brandon turns from the mirror and grabs his keys and jacket.

BRANDON
Come on.

EXT - SKATE WORLD PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A majestic neon sign glows in the night: SKATE WORLD.

The lot is full of beautiful, alluring teenagers - some sit
on cars, smoke and talk. Others make out. All try to be

cool. All are straight. At the other end of the lot, Lonny
and Brandon get out of their car. Lonny surveys the wall of

teenagers.
LONNY
No fucking way.
BRANDON
Yes, fucking way. Come on, don’t be

a pussy.
Brandon grabs Lonny to go, but Lonny won’t budge.

LONNY
Fine, I’m a pussy.

Brandon makes another start. Lonny grabs him. Brandon shakes
himself free, straightens his wrinkled shirt.

BRANDON
Someone’s waiting. I gotta go.
Don’t worry. Just wait.

Lonny slicks Brandon’s hair to the side. Brandon runs off

and disappears into the crowd. Lonny watches. SLO MO on
Brandon as he makes his way through and enters.

Brandon holds Heather closer to him as they skate.

TOM
So, can you cover for me tomorrow

BRANDON

Sorry, man. I got a date.

one's looking, then reaches into one coat pocket and then
another, removes a wallet and steals a $20 bill.

EXT - HEATHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT 14

Brandon, in a cool jacket, walks up loaded with gifts -
flowers and chocolate. Heather opens the door, she’s upset.

BRANDON

"Shoop." Heather looks on in awe, comes up behind and kisses
him. They kiss and kiss. She leads him to the couch,
whispers, "Billy," and starts to unbutton her blouse. He
helps her. She starts to open his pants. Lost in desire,

he helps her - then stops himself.

INT - BRANDON’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 22

Brandon channel surfs - wrestling, Speed Racer. He spaces
out, then notices Jake asleep on his lap. He looks to the
phone, looks away, eases Jake onto the couch, grabs the phone,

says "Hello?"

INT - HEATHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 23

BRANDON
Heather? (Silence) Look I know I’m

miss you, can’t we just go skating -
for like an hour.

HEATHER
I looked up that word, hermaphodite -
it said it was an animal. I can’t
date an animal, Billy.

Brandon takes a deep breath. Another voice comes on.
HEATHER’S MOM (0.S.)

Please don’t call here anymore or

I'll call the cops.
She hangs up. He mouths bewildered, "the cops?", hangs up,
stands and moves down the hall past family photos - Teena at
5, in an Easter dress; at 8, playing air guitar like Chrissie
Hynde; at 16, traces of "Brandon," in fatigues, her arms
protectively around Tammy, 20, another of the family.
A 1970's photo of a man on a motorcycle - young and handsome.
Brandon reflected in the glass resembles the man. He slicks
his hair back like the man's. Rain.

BRANDON
Damn! There’s a lot a them.

LONNY

What the fuck have you done?

They stand by the window, terrified - angry voices outside -
pounding on the trailer. Brandon looks at Lonny.

BRANDON
(fingers to his lips)
Shhh!

LONNY
I’m calling the police.

BRANDON
NO! Not the police.

Lonny looks at him. Pounding gets louder. The trailer
shakes. Stuff falls. Then it stops. Brandon and Lonny
listen. The voices seem to move away. Brandon looks at
Lonny.

BRANDON
Close, huh?

Lonny shoves him up against the wall.

BRANDON
Tell them that. I’m the best
boyfriend they ever had. It's true.

LONNY
It's true. (Pause) For about a week.

Lonny grabs Brandon's wallet and takes his last $20.

BRANDON
Hey, what’re you doing?

LONNY
The money you owe me. I want it
back. All of it.
Lonny sees a credit card with the name "Alicia Harris."

LONNY
You stole her Visa Card?

BRANDON
I didn’t steal it. It's like
Robinhood. She wanted a suede jacket.
It was her birthday.

LONNY
Robin Hood!? - You’re out of your
fucking mind.

BRANDON
Lonny, don’t say that.

LONNY
I thought you were getting a grip.

Lonny throws the wallet down. It hits the ground.

BRANDON

LONNY
What happened to that shrink?

BRANDON
She said I was a dyke.

Lonny looks at him like "what if you are?"

BRANDON
Don’t even start.

Lonny sits down by him and helps him pick up the pictures.

LONNY
There’s gotta be another way.

INT - POST OFFICE - DAY 26

Brandon faces a wall of P.O. Boxes, he reaches in and grabs
an envelope. Inside, a pamphlet "Trans - The Uninvited
Dilemma." He slips it inside a comic book and pours over
sexy images of pre- and post-ops - seizing on words "Sex
change," "a miracle." He looks up thrilled. He turns the
page - "surgical procedure," "costs" and "psychological
screening." He looks up again. His heart pounds.

A FLASH. A surgical instrument, flesh, sounds of an incision.

He looks around, scrunches the pamphlet, stuffs it in his
pocket, avoids eye contact and walks swiftly.

He nearly runs into a parked car. He stops and looks it
over ~- a beautiful vintage Cadillac resembling the car in
his dream. He looks closer - the keys are in the ignition.
He looks around - no one in sight. He reaches for the door.

INT - VINTAGE CAR TRAVELLING ON MAIN STREET - DAY 27

"Mr .Big Stuff" blasts. Brandon drives, barely seeing over

Lindy leans in and kisses him. Brandon smiles.

29 INT - JUVENILE HALL - JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - DAY 29
The Judge goes through Brandon’s aliases and wrap sheet -

hands him a note, "My Uncle Dan Maupin, he passed away..."

JUDGE
Miss Brandon, how do you plead?

BRANDON
Not guilty, your honor, Sir.

JUDGE
Miss Brandon, due to your recidivism,
lying and lack of custodial guardian,
I’m assigning a sentencing hearing
for two weeks from today, for November

Agitated and frayed, he dials another number.

BRANDON

Mary, wait. I need a place to stay.

(click).

Outta change and numbers, he looks up to see a girl he
recognizes - Heather. He straightens himself out and is
about to approach her, when he sees a diamond ring on her
finger. A big handsome guy appears and kisses her. They
turn towards Brandon. He ducks into the dark, disappearing
into the rough crowd.

He makes his way to the bar, spends his last $2 on a shot,
throws it back, then looks up to see CANDACE, 22, perched
beside him.

CANDACE
Bad night?

BRANDON
The worst. I just ran into my ex-
girlfriend...with her fiance.

CANDACE
Rough.

BRANDON
I woulda laid down my life for her.

Brandon disappears. Candace tries to ignore a GUY by her.

CANDACE
I said get lost.

GUY
Come on bitch. You were lookin' at

CANDACE

Brandon returns with cigarettes and sizes up the situation.

BRANDON
Why don't you leave her alone? I
don’t want any trouble.

GUY

You gotta be kidding. I didn’t ask

what you wanted, you little faggot.
The guy shoves Brandon. Brandon throws a punch. The guy
decks him. Candace watches in awe as Brandon jumps up, gets
knocked down, and gets back up, ready to throw himself at
the guy. Someone restrains Brandon. Brandon turns to see:

JOHN, 20, handsome, tough, something not quite right about
him, is smiling and holding Brandon’s arms.

BRANDON
Get off! Let me at that fucker!

JOHN
Hold on cowboy.

The bartender and a bouncer hold the other guy back.

Brandon catches his reflection.

CANDACE
Maybe we should take him to a doctor.

Brandon strikes a match. As John leans in to get his

John’s fist comes out of the darkness, a play hit grazing
Brandon’s face. Brandon pretends to go down. They catch up
to RAY, 21, skinny, weird.

He's spraying "EAT ME, LINCOLN, N.E." in emerald green.
Brandon nods, then staggers. John catches him.

JOHN
We’1l drop you off as soon as we

Brandon hangs up about to cry. He gravitates to emerald

BRANDON
No more girls. No more.

40 INT - CANDACE'S FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 40

Brandon enters. Candace with her child, age 2, channel surfs.
Candace smiles at him. He notices it's already 3 pm.

CANDACE
Hey handsome.

BRANDON
Oh Hey. That’s quite a TV.

CANDACE
Yep, 202 channels, plus HBO and MTV.

A chick, kinda slutty like Candace, comes on MTV.

CANDACE (CONT'D)
Oooh. I hate her. She’s gross.
(flirtatious) You like it when girls
act like that?

BRANDON
It sells records, I guess.

Sexy women come on TV. Brandon looks away from them.

CANDACE
(flirtatious)
Yeah, to gross perverts... (seeing
him look away) You still brooding
over your fiancée?

BRANDON
What? Yeah, it’s a long story.

He takes the kid from her.
CANDACE

(seductively)
God, you’re really good with kids.

I'd drive you in a second, but I

just come to the bar on my shift.
I’1l get you a ride in no time.
Plenty of the truckers are my friends.

Brandon hands the kid back.
41 INT - OASIS BAR - DUSK

He enters. Day drinkers ritually turn, check him out, then
turn back. Candace is working.

CANDACE
He's going to Lincoln later tonight.

She points out the TRUCKER, criminal, wiry, at the bar.
42 INT - OASIS BAR MEN'S BATHROOM ~ DUSK

Brandon looks indecisively from the urinal to the stall.
The Trucker enters, Brandon pretends to zip his pants, then
flushes the urinal.

TRUCKER
It's gonna be a long night. You
want something to help you stay awake?

The Trucker takes out some drugs.

BRANDON
What, you mean like coke?

TRUCKER
Nah, man. I hate coming down off
coke out here. Makes you wanna ram
the truck into a station wagon full
of kids, right? These are kinda

BRANDON

Thanks again.

INT - OASIS BAR - NIGHT - LATER 43

SLO MO. The bar’s come to life. Men line the bar. A juke
box plays. Brandon notices some beautiful girls looking his
way. He smiles politely, walks over to where John and Ray
play pool. John smiles and gives Brandon a drink.

JOHN
Hey champ. Heading out tonight?

BRANDON
Yeah.

Brandon drinks. John takes Brandon’s glass and puts it down.

JOHN
I wanna show you something you can
use on those assholes in Lincoln.

John puts his fists in a fighting stance. He indicates
Brandon do the same. Brandon does.

JOHN
(laughs)
No, man! Not like that!

John fixes Brandon’s stance and gently swipes him across the
head.

JOHN (CON'T)
Come on. Watch my eyes.

Brandon and John lock eyes. John throws a punch, Brandon
blocks it. John throws another. Brandon blocks that one
too.

JOHN (CON'T)
Better. Now come at me.

Brandon throws a punch. John blocks it and grabs him in a
boxer’s hug. Ray comes over. John lets go. Brandon is
shaken, but pleased.

JOHN
Looks like you’ re riding with Gary
Gilmore.

CANDACE

Shut up, John, he seems fine, right?

JOHN
Yeah, just like family.

KATE, 19, JOHN’S COUSIN, tough, good-looking, enters.

KATE
She wandered off.

Kate goes back outside.

JOHN
(to Brandon)
Stick around, you got time. There’s
gonna be some karaoke if these girls
get their shit together. (He heads
out, calling) Lana.

Brandon listens to their echoes of "Lana," watches the trucker
drink, then looks up to see:

AT THE BAR - A beautiful, high-strung girl downs a second
Jeigermeister and grimaces. It's LANA, 19. Candace, John
and Kate descend upon her. Brandon watches.

CANDACE
Lana, let's go on already.

Chain-smoking, hands trembling, Lana orders a drink.

KATE
Forget it, Candace.

CANDACE,
But Lana it was your idea.

Still no response. Kate orders a drink. Finally, the girls
sweep Lana towards the stage. She looks Brandon's way.

LANA

MOMENTS LATER. The music comes on, a mid-tempo country song.
Candace, Kate and Lana shift nervously as the intro plays.
The equipment fails.

KATE
Come on Lana.

Lana holds the mike, nearly dropping it. As the words begin,
she lip-synchs in a soft, unsteady voice.

LANA
The lonesome Texas sun, was setting
slow. And in the rearview mirror, I
watched it go.

Someone accidentally knocks over a chair. John turns.

JOHN
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

Terrified, the guy at the table apologizes. Onstage, Kate
and Candace roll their eyes. John nods at Lana to continue,
ad but the song has gone on. Lana struggles to catch up.

LANA
(singing)
.--Still see the wind in her golden
hair I close my eyes for a moment,
And I’m still there...

The song moves into its chorus, Lana closes her eyes, moving
her head back and forth to the music.

LANA
The bluest eyes in Texas, are haunting
me tonight.

Brandon watches, leaning into the music. This is something
he hadn't expected.

LANA (CON’ T)
Like the stars that fill the midnight
sky, her memory fills my mind. Where
did I go wrong?

Ray whispers to a guy at the table. They look at John and
laugh. John is gone, transfixed by Lana’s singing.

only make it worse.

LANA
GODDAMN it to hell!
Brandon watches Lana, looking like he died and went to heaven.
46 EXT - OASIS BAR - NIGHT

Brandon stands by the trucker who is preparing to leave. He
sees John and Co. pour from the bar. John is about to get
into a driver’s seat when a sheriff's deputy's car pulls up.
One deputy is BRIAN, Candace’s brother. John rolls his eyes
and hands the keys to Ray.

JOHN
(brooding to Candace)
What fucking business is it of his,
Jesus, how’d you two grow up in the
same family?

CANDACE
Forget it John, he’s as bored as
you.

Brian and the other deputy walk to a domestic dispute pouring
out of the bar. All get in the car except for Lana.

LANA
Look, what're we gonna do anyway?

Pause while they think this over.

KATE
What we always do, go driving around.

LANA
I don't wanna go driving around in

Candace drives off. Brandon fixes on Lana standing in the

EXT - OASIS BAR - NIGHT 47

Moments later, Candace pulls up, the car filled with pot
smoke. Candace and Kate are laughing. Candace's head is on
the steering wheel and Kate's is on the dash. John leans
out with a 6-pack.

LANA
What the fucking fuck? I thought
you were gonna be like 5 minutes.

CANDACE
(still laughing)
We only been gone like three minutes.

LANA
3 MINUTES!! More like 3 fucking

KATE

Yes, you are right. We are stuck

JOHN

Jesus, get in the car already.

Lana sits on John’s lap. Trucker finishes what truckers do,
gets into the cab and starts his engine. Candace sees
Brandon.

CANDACE
Brandon...you stayed. Come here.

Brandon wanders over to their car.
CANDACE (CONT'D)
That guy probably is a psycho killer.
Come with us. Crash with me again.
Brandon looks at the Trucker, then at Candace, unsure. John

throws him a Bud. It flips end over end toward him in SLO

JOHN
Ray was like, "Where's my camera,"
right?

BRANDON

But you saved everyone?

JOHN
Yeah, Ray was a big hero. He rescued
everyone. Right, dickwad?

RAY
(proud and excited)
When they brought me in, they were
like, "This is the biggest fucking
fire around here in 50 years!" You
probably saw it in the Lincoln paper.
That was me.

A girl drinks a 40 oz. COLT 45 and breastfeeds her baby.

CANDACE
God, I’d die if we lived like that.

LANA
You guys. We do.

Two guys watch a kid bumperski off the back of a big wheel

The only oil field you're getting
close to is when you're pumping gas
at the Kwik Stop for the rest of
your life.

BRANDON
Yeah, I’m thinking a being a smoke

something. Fight fires, make lotsa
money, then travel all over.
Memphis.. Graceland. ..Tennessee.

RAY
You dick, Graceland is IN Memphis

Lana is about to take a hit, but starts laughing.

BRANDON
I know it. When I was done, I'd
spend all that money I made and make
a virtual reality room and watch it

Lana is about to hand Brandon the pipe.

LANA
Whatever, I think maybe you had
enough.

Ray drinks bourbon, looks at John, then at Brandon.

JOHN
All right Brandon, that means you.

Lana watches. Hear the big engine of the truck.
49 EXT - RIVER - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 4

John peels off his shirt. His body is beautiful - C.U. on
his pecs and stomach. Rivetted, Brandon unconsciously touches
his hand to his own torso. John takes a hit, blows smoke in
Brandon's face, then shows off one scar running down his

neck and another on his wrist.

JOHN
This stuff made me walk right through
a glass door. Didn’t feel a thing.

He offers Brandon the pipe. Brandon considers, declines
then walks to the truck. Kids wander over from the trees
and watch.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Alright. This here's Brandon. He’s
a mean prizefighter from up to
Lincoln, so be careful what you say
to him.

A few of the kids laugh and shout. One whistles, and calls
out in an effeminate voice, "Hey Brandon, wanna suck my dick?"

JOHN
(leans in and whispers)
Don’t let em scare you. Go ahead.
Be a man.

Brandon grabs the bumper, jogs, holds on and skis. He's up
a while then goes down, crashing hard. John and Ray come up

as he brushes himself off. Ray offers another hit. Brandon
declines, takes a drink, instead.

Lana watches.
LANA
God, he is a freak.
Laughing, John mouths to Brandon "one more time."

LANA AND KATE
Stop it, John.

JOHN

Ok, ok. (He runs up towards the
truck). Slow down man! Slow down!

Brandon gets ready to go again. Lana stares at John. John
grabs Brandon.

JOHN
Take it easy.

BRANDON

JOHN
Yeah, you're fine. You're done.

John pats his cheek hard with affection. Ray watches.

Lana and Kate disappear into the woods. John and Brandon
watch. Kids wander over, check Brandon out. One hands him
a beer. Brandon takes it, drinks. More kids gather around.

EXT - KWIK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT 50

Candy-apple red trucks and neon gas pumps. The kids descend
like winged furies, some in cars, some on foot. Farm kids
in trucks gather by the pumps, white trash and stoner kids
by the WALL. John, Ray, Candace and Brandon move through
the gathering throng of teens. Candace and Ray enter the K-
stop.

Jobn leads Brandon to the curb. They watch. A pickup lurches
to a halt by a kid talking to a teenage girl. A 35-year-old
drunken DAD jumps out and pushes his chest against the kid’s.
John sips his beer, then gives it to Brandon.

JOHN
Look at that dickweed. Fucks all
the 14-year-old girls. This is gonna

be goad.
DAD

Another guy whips off his shirt, pushes against the Dad.

Brandon.

Glad you stayed?

Brandon sees: Candace, John and Ray silhouette the K-stop -
Teens and cars fill the lot. The straight nightlife unfolds
before him. He seems to have arrived. He nods, "yep."

51 INT - CANDACE’S FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - 4 A.M. - NIGHT 51

Candace lovingly tucks Brandon in - a pillow under his head,
an afghan over him. She turns off the light and goes to
bed. Brandon stirs, then wakes up. Groggy, he relives the
night. A realization. He stares at the ceiling, shakes his
head.

BRANDON
(frustrated to himself)
Shit!

He looks at his crotch - a bloodstain along the inside thigh.

52 INT - CANDACE'S FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 52
Brandon holds his pants up and shakes his head--A LOST CAUSE.
He dumps the remains from his bag: Swiss Army knife, condoms,
bandana, ashes, tickets, a sock. He removes a tampon wrapper,
no tampon. "Fuck." He rummages the cabinets, still no
tampon. He opens the bathroom door, all is quiet and dark.

53  EXT/INT - KWIK-STOP DESERTED PARKING LOT - NIGHT 53
Brandon rolls up, in Candace's car. He's relieved no one's

Brandon runs in.

Cashier points to the back. Brandon spies tampons and is

back inside.

CASHIER

LANA
Fine. I'll browse.

Lana moves down the aisle, parallel to Brandon, running her
hand along the colored boxes. Eyes glazed. Two truckers
enter.

LANA

trucker}
Beer’s in the back if you want it.

Trucker looks her over. Lana stares at the beercase, then
sees movement reflected in the glass. Brandon pockets the
tampon. Lana turns.

Lana staggers back. Brandon crosses to steady her.

Lana drinks it. It's horrible. Brandon sees a stuffed cow,
cow calendar, cow mug, cow pillow and cow sheets.

LANA
Yeah, I got something for cows.

Brandon goes to turn on the radio--also a cow. Lana says
"No!" turns away. Brandon sits back and watches her, not

No. I can’t sing to save my life.

DREAM - INDETERMINATE WHITE BACKGROUND

Drenched skin. Brandon wakes up soaked in sweat. He peels
a layer of skin off his face, looks at it, then looks down
at his body - A perfect, pumped Marky Mark body. He runs
his hand down his muscley stomach, resting it inside his
briefs. Beside him are the sheaths of female skin he has
shed.

INT - CANDACE’S FARMHOUSE - THE COUCH - MORNING

Brandon jolts awake, checks to see if the boy body is his,

He looks out the window to see the dreamlike green fields
and blue sky. He falls back into his fantasy.

drift on air. Their young parents hang out. A teenage guy
kisses his girlfriend. Teenage boys, beautiful, in cowboy
boots, come walking in through the glaring sun.

TEEN BOY
Hey, dude. You got a light?
BRANDON

Brandon hands him the book. The boys walk off into the sun’s

pain. Please forgive me, I wanted
you to find out how good I could

Brandon sees his bag has been moved. He looks Candace over,
trying to see what she knows. She stares into his eyes.

CANDACE
Brandon, I've been thinking, I don’t

go back.

He tries to contain his excitement.

Wrapped in a towel from his shower, Brandon avoids the full-
length mirror as he dries off. He straps his breasts down,
and inserts a tampon. He is about to toss the wrapper in
the garbage, but sticks it in the heating vent, instead.

Brandon packs his dildo, slips his briefs on, adjusts his
bulge and snaps the elastic band on his briefs.

you're her new favorite candidate.

BRANDON
I can't believe you worked last night.
You must be exhausted.

Lana enters, finds Polaroids that Brandon shot, of her and
her mom, of him as a gangster, of him and Heather dressed
for a prom, of other girls. She grabs them.

LANA
Me either, I do it all the time,
though. You don't have to be sober
to weigh spinach. I'm crashing really
hard. But I'm serious, Brandon.
You should watch it with Candace.
She's always scheming how to get
that evil little baby a dad.

BRANDON
Yeah, we're eloping, but you can
come too.

LANA
(dreamily)

Thanks, I'll be the nanny, no more

Her thoughts fail to form sentences and evaporate.

Awkward silence. He moves to his bag, near her.

himself, and slips himself inside her. Lana's eyes move up
to the trees, then close. Lana opens her eyes, looks down
his body and sees inside the top of his shirt--the edge of
his Ace bandage. She squints harder. Seeing a hint of his
cleavage, she pushes him off and rolls away.

Lana sits breathing hard, squeezing her eyes shut. Brandon's
confusion turns toward fear. He zips up his pants, moves by
her, kisses her hand cautiously and strokes her neck gently.

BRANDON
You okay?

LANA
Yeah, I mean no, I mean, I'm fine.

quickly.

JOHN TO RAY (0.S.)

Yep, be right out.

He reaches back into the shower, and struggles to open the

189 EXT - LANA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME 189
John walks out the door and onto the porch where Ray has
been waiting. They walk off. Mom comes to the doorway and
watches, then closes the door and locks it. Through the
window: we see her turn on the TV, sit down and watch.
Lana runs to arrive ahead of John and Ray at their car.
LANA
(casual)
What are you guys doing?
John looks at her, suspiciously.
LANA

Ray shakes his head "no." Lana looks at John. From the
dark, a hand touches Lana’s shoulder. She turns to see Kate.

KATE
Lana, come with me. Please.

LANA
No! What’s goin' on here? John?

John looks from Kate to Lana. Ray opens the door, gets in.

RAY
Let’s go!
Lana grabs John.
LANA
I’m coming with you.
KATE
No Lana!
LANA
Get off me!

She pushes Kate back. John looks at Lana. He smiles.

JOHN
Okay, darling.

He opens the door. She gets in. They get in. They drive
off.

190 EXT - EDGE OF THE HIGHWAY - BLACK AND DREAMY. 1
Dust like in Brandon’s dream. Car lights illuminate Brandon,
on his moped, at the entrance ramp. For a moment, there are
no cars. He rides onto the highway, loses himself in the
blackness. He’s all alone. He stops and turns back.

191 INT - JOHN'S MOM'S CAR —- TRAVELLING - NIGHT 1

Lana’s in back. John has the gloves on. Ray sees a deputy
sheriff's car, slows.

RAY
(sinister)
Think they'd still recognize her if

off?

LANA
John!

John has a gun. He grabs Lana by the neck, smiles.
JOHN
We’re just taking care of a couple a
dykes. Are you one a them?
Lana just stares at hin.

JOHN
Still planning on going to Memphis?

192 EXT - CANDACE'S FARMHOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 192
Brandon leans the moped against the porch. He’s about to
take it to the back, when a figure appears on the porch, a
handsome cowboy - Brandon's father. He smiles at Brandon.

DAD
So, are you ready?

He puts his hand out to him. Brandon takes it, then stops.

BRANDON
Not yet.

His dad kisses his forehead, walks right into Brandon, then
walks off alone disappearing into the moonlit silvery fields.

193 INT - CANDACE'S BARN - NIGHT 193
Brandon sits down, and notices something lying on the ground -
Lana’s ring. He picks it up, smiles, then he puts it in his
pocket. His gaze travels out the window, across the fields,
to car lights on the highway.

194 EXT - CANDACE'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 194
John and Ray park. John takes the knife from his boot and
hands it to Ray. Ray holds the knife under his coat. John
holds the gun.

LANA

What’ re we doing here? What’re you
gonna do something to Candace?

She’s got a baby, John!

Their moving feet. Lana sees the moped off to the side.
REAL TIME.

John marches on. They make it to the rickety door.
LANA
(screams)

195 INT/EXT - CANDACE'S BARN - NIGHT 1s
INTERCUT WITH PREVIOUS SCENE.

Sounds return. Brandon grows scared, distinguishes the sound,
turns for the door and walks out.

~ 196 INT - CANDACE'S FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 1s

John kicks the door in. They enter, and look for a light.

JOHN
Get outta here.

John grabs Lana and pushes her back. She falls.

LANA
No! (calling out) Brandon, Brandon.

John, and Ray face the bedroom. Brandon appears in the back
doorway, looking girlish, but strong, calm, assured.

BRANDON
(direct and calm)
Don't hurt Candace. She’s got nothing
to do with this. John. You don’t
have to do this.

For a moment John listens, comprehending.
BRANDON
(gently, almost kindly)

You were right about me John. I
just keep getting back up.

RAY
SHUT UP. Don’t listen to her.

Brandon looks at Lana, trying to make sense of why she’s
there.

LANA
Teena, why didn’t you leave?

Brandon smiles at her. She looks at him. For a moment,
it's as if the two of them are all alone.

LANA
We can still go.

John fires at Brandon. Brandon starts to fall, Ray yanks
him up, pulls out a knife and stabs him. Candace appears at
the door. A gun blast, Candace falls. John throws the gun.
Lana runs to Brandon's body. Ray grabs the gun and raises
it to shoot Lana. John knocks it from him.

JOHN
Come on. Lana. Lana!

John goes to her. Lana is in another world. Ray grabs John.
They go.

FADE TO WHITE

LANA (V.0O.)
It's cold, the lights have been shot
out.

INT - CANDACE'S FARMHOUSE - DAWN LIGHT BURNS THROUGH - DAWN 197

Light pours in. Lana comes to, sees the dead bodies, the
baby watching. She recalls the night and grows terrified.
A hand gently touches her hair. She looks up and sees her
mom.

MOM
(whispering gently)
Come on baby. Everything’s gonna be
OK.

Lana pulls a letter from Brandon's pocket. Lana's mom grabs
Lana’s sweater from the floor and helps her up.

MOM
Things are gonna go back to the way
they were before.

Lana opens the letter, and reads as her mom leads her out.

Changes I'm going though in my life
will change me forever.

Reveal, this is a busy crime discovery scene. A police
photographer snaps photos. EMTs cover the body, carry it on
a stretcher past the overturned lamp, through the kicked-in
door frame, down the farmhouse steps, past a deputy stretching
crime scene tape around the house, down to the lawn where an
ambulance’s doors swing open. EMTs load the body in. A
LINCOLN NEWSCASTER reports.
