NIGHTBIRDS
In Darkness, we hear TINKLING glasses and RUSTLING feathers.

MACK
Could I get a spot here?

A SPOTLIGHT hits MACK THE MOCK, a white-suited mockingbird at
a microphone. A glitzy show curtain sparkles behind him.

MACK (CONT'D)
Ladies and gentlemen, gulls and
boychicks, welcome to Birdland!
(WHISTLES, feathery APPLAUSE)
Perched high in the beautiful Treetop
Lounge, we’ve got a great show for you
tonight. So put your wings together for
Artie Caw and his Crow Bar Ban

Another SPOT hits the “CROW BAR BAND” - THREE CROWS on
keyboard, bass and drums, led by another crow, ARTIE CAW.

MACK (CONT'D)
And welcome everybody's favorite songbird
Miss Flo Nightingale...

SPOTLIGHTS converge on FLO -- packed into sequins and
spangles, she’s the sexiest nightingale you ever saw.

MACK (CONT’D)
I’m your host, Mack the Mock --
geooming MovieFone voice)
“Bird of a thousand voices!”
(Bobby Darin)
“Look out ol’ Macky is back, yeah!”
Professor Caw, if you please?

Artie’s band strikes up a SONG INTRO (”NIGHTBIRDS”) -- a big
epese gi number straight out of a great old RKO movie, except
these singers have wings. Call it a Busby Birdly musical.
Flo joins Mack at the mic, sings:

FLO
Most birds work and hunt all day,
Never stop to sing or play...

MACK
Come sundown,
They're run-down.

FLO
But some birds sleep the day away,
Till twilight falls...

MACK
Then hey-hey-hey!

MACK & FLO
We're the fun set, up at sunset,
Flying till dawn --
When other birdies turn in early,
We turn on! We're...

LIGHTS UP FULL -- the curtain rises to REVEAL a chorus line
of glitter-garbed NIGHTINGALES. WHISTLES and CHEERS.
NIGHTINGALES
Nightbirds!
Hey, put out the light, birds,
It's time for us nightbirds
To rise and shine...

MACK
The Birdland Beauties, everybody!

NIGHTINGALES
Nightbirds!
You want pure delight, birds?
You came to the right birds!
Tonight you'll feel fine!

The Chorusbirds do a tap break. REVEAL they’re onstage at..
EXT. BIRDLAND - NIGHT

A lavish nightclub with leafy tables and booths built into
the branches of a huge tree. The stage is the ledge of a
gothic cathedral, framed by two gargoyles. The decor
suggests a Deco 430s speakeasy. Now Mack takes center stage.

MACK
Sure, I_ know early birds
Catch all the worms --
But what kinda squirrelly birds
Want breakfast that squirms?
I'd rather dine with the...

ALL
Nightbirds!
If dayltg ght's too bright, birds,
And blue skies make va blue (Boo hoo hoo) --
You just might, bir
Be nightbirds, too!

APPLAUSE as the Nightingales pose. A scenic curtain falls,
featuring a farm with crowing rooster. Mack takes the mic.

MACK
(Elvis)
“Thank you, thank y’ very much.”
As you know, someone very special is
making his debut here tonight.

(imitates OWL)

“Whooo? Whooo?” Oh, the owls are
getting impatient, I’1l tell you who --
Kid Bantam, that’s who!

(imitates HEN)
“Cluck-uck-uck-uck-bakaw!"” Listen to
those hens, they love him -- staying up
late, huh, ladies? Okay, don’t get your
eggs in a scramble.

(off loony LAUGHS in crowd)

Hoo-boy, the loons are out tonight--“Hoo-
hoo-hoo-hoo-hoooe!” Now lemme tell you a
little about the Kid. You know his real
name? First time I met him, I ask
“What’s your name?” And he says,
“dagnabbit, shuddup!” So I say, hey,
shuddup yourself, I’m just asking. And
he says, get this _- “No, that’s my name -
- Dagnabbit Shuddup! Anyway, that’s what
the farmer calls me.” Kid you not. True

etary
From the farmyard scene on the curtain...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. FARM - NIGHT

A real farmyard scene. The mailbox reads “FARMER FAMILY
FARM. All the lights are off in the ramshackle farmhouse,
and the henhouse next to it. A COW dozes with a DONKEY, PIGS
sleep together, the night is quiet. Then...

Rooster DAG pops into frame, CROWING.

DAG
Brakakakak! Brakakakak! Erkakakak-aroo!

His chest swells -- his throat puffs -- his wattle wobbles as
he blasts his brassy jazz riff into the silent night.

DAG (CONT'D)
Er-er-roooo, ba-kak! Er-roooo, ba-kak!
Er-roo bak-kak-kak-kak-kak!

The night starts to respond, As Dag’s crow wakes them up,
the animals start to complain...

COW/DONKEY/PIGS
Oooooocooch.... Yawwwwwwww.... Roink!

Somewhere, a dog starts to HOWL. Other DOGS join in.

A light comes on in the henhouse doorway. PENNY emerges --
the cutest little chick you ever saw -- wide awake and eyes
sparkling as she listens to Dag crow. Older HENS appear
behind her, squinting, groggy and grumpy.

OLD HEN
Get back to bed. Don’t encourage him.

Now a CRYING BABY adds his voice to the cacophony -- and
LIGHTS start going on in the farmhouse.

DAG
Brakaka-kak, a rooo! Brak..

FARMER (0.S.)
Dagnabbit! Shuddup!

Dag’s in musical seventh-heaven, so he doesn’t see the BOOK
hurled out of the farmhouse window behind him... which CONKS
him in the head, silencing him in mid-song.

DAG
Bak-kak-kak---unk!

Dag sprawls, knocked unconscious. Penny moves to help --
then retreats as...

THE FARMER stomps out of the house in his long-johns with
length of twine in his hands. He kneels by Dag and loops fhe
knotted twin around his beak -- an improvised muzzle.

FARMER
Last chance, Dagnabbit.
He turns back to the house as Dag woozily comes around... to
see he’s muzzled. Dag FREAKS OUT. He strains against the
twine, trying to crow -- but he can only CROAK miserably...

DAG
Melp! Melp...

Penny rushes to help, pecks at the muzzle. Dag pulls away.

PENNY
Don’t worry, I’m not gonna kiss you.

But Dag’s lovestruck eyes tell us that’s the last thing he’s
worried about. He lets Penny bite his muzzle -- they both
twist and pull -- and after an awkwardly intimate moment...
Penny pulls the muzzle off! Dag CROWS in delight.

DAG

ERK-ERK-A-ROO!
(catches himself, whispers)

Erk-erk-a-roo.

The noise brings the older hens back to the henhouse door...

HENS.
Keep it down! Knock it off! Go to bed,
ya freaks!

OLD HEN
Better yet -- fly the coop! Then we can

all get some sleep.

PENNY
You think we want to be up all night?
it’s just how we are.

OLD HEN
(righteous sniff)
No better than nightbirds.
The hens drift back to bed. Penny helps Dag up.

PENNY
Boy, he really threw the book at you.

DAG
Aaah, I’m okay. But how ‘bout you?
still getting henpecked?

PENNY
You should hear what they say about you.

DAG
Maybe they’re right. Maybe we should fly
the coop.

PENNY
Only problem with that? We can’t fly.

DAG
We could leave.

PENNY
You mean... cross the road?
DAG
Yeah.

PENNY
But... why?

DAG
Why not? See what’s on the other side?

PENNY

That's it? That’s your plan? “We’ll see
when we get there?”

“men”
Roosters. ‘No idea where they’re going,
and won’t even ask how to get there.
Well, til you get a little more specific
about your intentions, you can just cross
that road by yourself, mister.

DAG
Come on, Penny, don’t be so human.
PENNY
I’m not human! It’s just -- when I cross

the road with a guy, I wanna know what’s
on the other sidé. You get back to me
when you figure out where you’re going.

DAG
Where we’re going.

She smiles, softening. They nestle a little closer. Dag
CROWS a soft arpeggio, sings: ("If I Could Fly”)

DAG (CONT'D)
Talk about boring, everyone's snoring,

It's not even ha past’ eight...
PENNY
And here we are, staying up late
Again...
DAG

Everyone's always peckin'’ and pickin’ --
PENNY

“Well, she's an odd duck..."
DAG

“Man, he's one funky chicken."
DAG & PENNY

I wish we could up and take flight
To wherever birds stay up all night!

DAG PENNY
If I could fly, (spoken)
I'd say goodbye... Why?!

DAG PENNY
To everyone but you. Whew.

D. PENNY
If I could fly, Hey!

I'd fly away --
DAG PENNY
To find us a home somewhere Ooh...
new.

DAG
A home somewhere far,
Where we'll be who we are...

PENNY
Where we'll rest in our nest all day...

Where we’ iP Sta up and play
Til the night fades away...

DAG & PENNY
And who gives a hoot
What the other birds say!

If we could fl

We'd fly toget. er,
Birds of a feather
Across the sky,

To someplace free...
If only we

Could fly.

Penny’s eyes sparkle. Dag draws close. MUSIC continues
under. They’re just about to kiss when... CONK! A package
drops on Dash’s head. He spins and stumbles to the ground.
MUSIC stops. Penny rushes to help Dag up.

DAG
Ow! Man, I am having a bad head day.

ON THE PACKAGE - which has ripped open when it hit the
ground. Dag reaches down to pull out...

A SOUVENIR SNOWGLOBE with a city skyline. Dag shakes it.

REVERSE SHOT - Dag and Penny’s eyes are huge in the rounded
glass, as they watch glitter swirl around the tiny city.

DAG (CONT'D)
Hey, it’s snowing! I mean out here!

DAG'S POV - The snowglobe lowers to reveal a real sky full of
FLUTTERING WHITE FLAKES. No, not flakes -- pieces of mail,
drifting to earth. Dag and Penny stare in wonder.

ON THE POSTCARDS as they land -- Fairy-tale views of a
Manhattan-style city. Dag reads the printed messages.

DAG (CONT'D)

“Live the night life...” “Join us after
dark...” “The city that never sleeps!”
Dag looks to Penny, amazed -- here’s their answer! Penny's

eyes sparkle. They're just_about to kiss again when...
THWUMP! MUSIC stops abruptly as Dag and Penny are startled
apart by the crash-landing of a PIGEON right in front of
them. The pigeon (HOMER ) wears a messenger vest, a mailbag
slung over one wing, ermos on the other.
HOMER
Whoa! Hey lovebirds, sorry to interrupt,
it’s just my bag spilled and...
spots the snowglobe)
Whoa, lucky that didn’t break.

DAG
(points to his head)
No, but this did.

HOMER
Sorry dude, nothing serious, right?
(holds up his wings)
How many wings?

DAG
Duh -- two?

HOMER
Excellent, no concussion, hey, accidents
happen, you got insurance, right?

As he talks a mile a minute, he unslings a thermos from his
shoulder and pours a cup of coffee. Like many delivery
workers, Homer is hypercaffeinated.

HOMER (CONT'D)

Tell ya what, let’s be cool and not even
involve the vultures, dig? And you can
keep the doohickey.

Dag rubs his head angrily... Penny eyes the snowglobe
longingly... Dag eyes Penny longingly...

HOMER (CONT'D)
So... we cool?

(off Dag’s shrug)
Excellent. I’m Homer.

DAG
(as they shake wings)
Dagnabbit Shuddup.

HOMER
Whoa ace, say what now?

ENNY
That’s his name, call him Dag, I’m Penny.

HOMER
Thanks, Pen, you are one knockout chick,
and one righteous rooster. What are you
two doing up this time of night besides,
you know, chicken-necking? You two got
some nightbird in ya?

DAG
So they say.

HOMER |
It’s not a bad thing.

He picks up scattered postcards. Dag and Penny help.
DAG
Homer, where did these come from?

HOMER
The City. You never been to the City?

DAG
Is it really a “city that never sleeps?”

HOMER
Brother and how. You gotta go, it’1l
blow your birdy brains. The Central Park
Poopery... The Statue of Lavatory... The
International Airport-a-potty!
(off their looks)
Hey, I’ma a pigeon, the world is my

tollet. best of all...
(finds a postcard)
Birdland!

ON POSTCARD - a view of the lavish treetop nightclub.

HOMER (CONT'D)
“Home of the famous Treetop Lounge where
the nightbirds sing til dawn and closing
time's not til tomorrow.” Get off your
tailfeathers, check it out! It’s not

even that far, you can see it from here!

He flutters to the roof of the farmhouse porch. Penny and
Dag look helplessly at each other. Then...

Dag flaps onto the roof of the henhouse... then onto a tall
stack of crates. Penny follows tentatively. Dag leaps to
the trellis by the porch, grabs the slats with his claws. He
reaches his wings out for enny -- and catches her as she
jumps. Together they climb up the trellis to join Homer...

ON THE PORCH ROOF - Homer points to the distant lights of a
glittering skyline. Dag and Penny squint to make it out.

DAG
Wow! You think we could make it there?

HOMER

Well if you can make it there, you’ll

make it anywhere.

(sees Penny’s reluctance)

You know, you could go first -- get a
job, finda place --_and come back for
enny once you" re all set up. I’11 help,

just _call when ya get there. I’m at the

Hotel Broadwa Catch you on the

flipside, fow. $!

With a salute he takes off. Dag and Penny wave goodbye --
then look at the city. MUSIC UNDER ("If I Could Fly”).

PENNY
It's so big... and so distant...
DAG

But it's not non-existent!
Now our destination's in sight...
DAG & PENNY
Just a couple of loonies,
Out here in the boonies...
Still we feel that it's real
And it's right!

So_ you and I

Will keep our eyes on
That far horizon
Across the sky,

Where we'd be free...

If only we

Could fly.
They nestle closer, silhouetted against the moonlit sky. The
night itself starts to fly via TIME-LAPSE FAST-MOTION:
The moon arcs downward -- they draw closer -- Dag puts a wing
around Penny -- she draws away -- they look at the sky --
awkwardly inch together again -- Penny lays her head on
Dag’s shoulder -- and he puts his wing around her.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

As sunlight seeps into the sky and paints it in pastels, Dag
and Penny nestle together, dozing.

PENNY
Dag? Isn't it time for you to...

DAG
Mmm? Oh yeah, okay...

He tries to straighten up and crow... then realizes -- he’s
on the edge of the roof! Groggy, he instantly falls off.

Penny SQUAWKS -- then takes a brave, running leap to the
crates... down to the henhouse... to the ground.

The Farmer emerges from the house, passes unconscious Dag...

FARMER
Pathetic.

He moves to open the gate for a TURNIP TRUCK as it turns in.
As Penny runs to Dag’s side, the other Hens emerge from the
henhouse, blinking and stretching in the dawn light. They
stare at Penny as if she were a fallen chicken.

OLD HEN
Pathetic.

As the Farmer helps the TRUCK DRIVER load baskets of turnips
onto his truck, he sees...

A LONG BLACK CAR approaching. It noses through the gate and
SQUEALS to a stop by the Farmer. Tinted glass rolls down,
replacing the Farmer’s reflection with the crabbed face of...

CAP'N PLUCKETT - a withered despot in a white linen suit. A
beady-eyed PARROT (PAULIE CRACKERS) rides on his shoulder; a
big RHODE ISLAND RED rooster (RED) dozes at his side; a
glowering HOUND DOG (GENERAL LEE) sits at his feet.
10.

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
Anything to sell me today, Farmer Farmer?

The farmer’s shadow closes in on sleeping Dag... who awakens
rudely as the Farmer hoists him into the air.

FARMER
How ‘bout this worthless rooster? Up all
night, sleeps all day. Heck, forget
selling, I’1ll give him to you.

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
I do have a certain interest in birds of
a nocturnal nature...

He pats his own sleeping rooster. The Farmer holds Dag up to
the window... where he attracts the attention of General Lee.
The Dog GROWLS. Dag squirms.

CAP'N PLUCKETT (CONT’D)
But that’s not what I want to purchase.

FARMER
I keep telling you, this land’s not for
sale. We ain’t dead yet.

CAP'N PLUCKETT
Sure you are, you just ain’t got the good
sense to lie down.

As the sun rises, a LARGE SHADOW FALLS over both men. REVEAL
the pastoral farm is bordered by a TOWERING BRICK WALL.

A billboard at the top reads “CAP'N PLUCKETT’S POULTRY” --
and features a likeness of the old Cap’n himself, lifting a
drumstick to his mouth with a motorized hand. Up and down it
goes, as the Cap’n takes the same bite forever.

BACK TO SCENE: The Cap’n hands the Farmer an official-
looking envelope -- NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE AND EVICTION.

CAP'N PLUCKETT (CONT'D)
Sorry about this, Farmer Farmer. Just
doin’ my duty is all.

; PAULIE CRACKERS
Doin’ my duty, rawk! Doin’ my duty.

Now General Lee BARKS at Dag -- who kicks out and lands a
swipe across the dog’s nose. Furious General Lee lunges
through the window. The Farmer pulls back and drops Dag...
who runs for his life, with General Lee in hot pursuit.

EXT. FARMYARD — DAWN

Dag races beneath HOES and RAKES leaning against the wall...
knocking them over as he passes. Hot on Dag’s tail, the
General stumbles and rolls over the clattering tools. He
finally rights himself -- and steps right on the blade of a
hoe which obeys the laws of slapstick and swings upright,
CONKING the dog in the noggin.

With a flutter of wings, Dag leaps lightly over a haystack.
Behind him, General Lee plows straight through -- and tumbles
out the other side, spitting hay and pawing it from his eyes.
11.

Dag heads straight for the gieeping MULE... and runs under
him, tickling the Mule’s belly as he goes. The Mule jagies
in his sleep... then wakes abruptly, annoyed. Who woke him
up? He looks behind him to see... General Lee approaching.
The Dog sees the angry mule ahead, ready to kick. He tries
to brake, but too late...

Dag looks back as the mule BRAYS and the bog YELPS. His eyes
follow General Lee’s brief flight and hard landing. THUD.
As the Cow and Pig wake, complaining loudly, Dag races to...

THE HENHOUSE - He dives through the small door with General
Lee inches behind. WHAM! The dog’s nose wedges tightly in
the henhouse door.

INT. HENHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Shaking from the impact. Feathers flying. Hens SQUAWKING in
alarm. Dag hurries to Penny...

DAG
Pen, remember we talked about me leaving?

Penny nods. Dag points at the dog’s snout behind him,
snarling and slavering as it tries to free itself.

DAG (CONT'D)
Seems like a good time.

Dag takes a peck at the snout. General Lee YOWLS and
strains to pull free of the door. Dag pecks as he talks...

DAG (CONT'D
It'll be okay, I'll find a job, and I‘1l
find a place for us to live....

PENNY
Together?

DAG
(takes her hint)
And I'1l find an all-night wedding
chapel!

PENNY
Dag, are you...?

DAG
Sure, will you...?

Before Penny can answer... CRRRRRAAAACK! Wood splits as the
dog pulls free, with the doorframe still jammed on his snout.

DAG (CONT'D)
Gotta go.

As he leaps out the wide-open door...

PENNY
Yes! The answer is yes!

EXT. HENHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

General Lee’s at the base of the henhouse ramp, trying to
pull the door-frame off his snout...
12.

-as Dag leaps out and lands hard on the top of the ramp.
The whole thing see-saws -- Dag’s end drops to the ground --
the other end lands an uppercut to General Lee’s jaw.

The dog YOWLS. Dag skeddadles. He takes a running, flapping
leap... and barely makes it to the top of the fence. Whew.

Angry hens watch Dag’s escape from their shattered doorway.

OLD HEN
Good riddance.

EXT. FARMYARD -— CONTINUOUS

Dag races along the rail with General Lee running below,
snarling jaws open to reveal a mouth full of teeth and drool.
The Turnip Truck is pulling out of the gate as Dag runs down
the fence... and leaps off!

He lands on turnips, which roll out from under him. Dag
slips -- slides -- almost tumbles off. But he curls his
claws around a truckbed rail and hangs on for dear life as
General Lee gallops through the gate, keeping pace. The dog
launches himself into the air, lunging at the tailgate...

Dag cringes as the dog torpedoes at him... then drops. DUST
illows as Lee hits the ground. Missed it by that much.

J settles his tailfeathers into the truckload of turnips,
watching the farm and furious General Lee shrink away.

MACK (V.O.)
And so our hero made the epic journe
from rural heartland to sin-soaked city.
A jazzy version of “(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66” plays as we
DISSOLVE TO:

DAG’‘S ROAD-TRIP MONTAGE - Bucolic heartland pastures pass by
as a SUPERIMPOSED ROAD MAP charts the truck’s progress with a

 

dotted line... Rural road signs become highway markers: Route

66, US 10 Forests and lakefronts give way to suburban

sprawl as... that DOTTED LINE nears a BIG CITY on the map.
MACK (CONT'D

He’s a little fuzzy on the details, since
he was traveling by day...

ON THE TRUCK BED -- where Dag dozes on turnips, SNORING.
MACK (CONT' D)
-so he pretty much slept through the
whole trip.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL the truck is now crawling in four lanes
of heavy traffic on...

EXT. BROOKLYNESQUE BRIDGE - AFTERNOON

Until the truck is just one of a thousand colorful specks
crossing the water into the BIG CITY SKYLINE.
13.

EXT. FARMER'S MARKET -— AFTERNOON

ON DAG - jolted awake as the truck stops. His eyes open...
DAG'S POV - CITY SKYSCRAPERS soar into the sky.

Dag blinks, looks again. The SKYSCRAPERS grow even taller.

Suddenly the truck RATTLES as the driver opens the tailgate
to unload. Dag SQUAWKS and leaps onto the street...

Where he’s nearly CREAMED by CAR TIRES speeding past. He
retreats under the truck...

And emerges on the other side. Sighs with relief -- then
SQUAWKS as he’s nearly trampled by sidewalk PEDESTRIANS. He
scurries one way to avoid RUSHING FEET -- then jumps the
other way as a BICYCLE whizzes by. He dives for safety..

EXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Dag crouches by a TRASHCAN, breathing hard as he gapes at all
the people and traffic barrelling past. He doesn’t see the
HEAD rising out of the trash above him -- black mask around
beady eyes -- meet COONEY the raccoon.

COONEY
Well well well, what we have we here,
Poss? -.-Poss?
Next to him in the trashcan dozes a POSSUM -- his partner in
crime POSS, the smaller and, at this hour, sleepier of the
pair. Their partnership is a Penn—and-Teller affair, with
Cooney doing all the talking.) Cooney nudges Poss awake.

COONEY (CONT'D)
Think this boy’s new in town?
(calls down to Dag)

Need some help, son?

Dag looks around --where’s that voice coming from? He’s
startled as Cooney leaps from the can and lands beside him.

COONEY (CONT'D)
I bet your mama told you not to talk to

strangers, so let’s be strangers no more.
I’m Cooney, and this is my partner, Poss.

Poss lands on the other side, again catching Dag off-guard.
DAG
Hey! Hi... I’m Dag.
(off Poss’s mute reaction)
Doesn’t talk much, does he?

COONEY
Silent partner.

DAG
Could you tell me how to get to Birdland?

Cooney and Poss trade a look -- can’t resist the set-up.
14.

COONEY
Practice! Practice!
(laughs, then)
I could tell you were a musician.

DAG
You could? I am? See, it’s my first
time in the city...

COONEY
No kiddin’. Fresh off the farm, no
experience, you’ll get yourself in big
trouble without expert professionals to
steer your career. Lucky you found us.

He nudges Poss, who hands Dag a business card. Dag reads:

DAG
“Cooney & Poss, Scavenging and Hauling?”

Cooney snatches the card away, as Poss hands Dag another.

DAG (CONT'D)
“Cooney & Poss, Pest Control!”

Cooney grabs Poss’s handful of business cards, fans through
them til he finds the one he wants. Hands it to Dag...

DAG (CONT’D)
“Cooney & Poss, Artists Management.”
Shoot, I’m no artist.

COONEY
We'll be the judge of that. Show us what
you got -- sing, dance, whatever you do.
DAG

Oh, I just crow a little...

Cooney and Poss feign eagerness. Bashful, Dag clears his
throat... SQUEAKS... settles... and starts to CROW.

DAG (CONT'D)
Brakakaw, brakakaw, brakakeeeee... baby!
Brakakaw brakakaw...

ON A WINDOW LEDGE high above, Mack the mockingbird is
adjusting his tie in the window’s reflection, singing:

MACK
Listen to the mockingbird, oh that crazy
mockingbird...

He stops as he hears Dag crowing below. Bops to the beat --
hey, not bad. He looks for the source of the sound...

BACK TO SCENE -- as Dag finishes big.

DAG
Brakak, brakeek, babop-dop-deep dra-kow!

COONEY
Whoa, dig that crazy sound. You got a
lotta talent. But not a lotta know-how,

nachaur Van naad a anand mananar
15.

Cooney starts to rub Dag’s shoulders with his paws...

As he talks, Cooney siyly lifts a corner of Dag’s left win
Poss reaches underneat! poking around for a pocket to pic

COONEY (CONT'D)
We’ll make sure ya meet the right birds.
Get the best gigs...

Poss shakes his head, nothing. So Cooney lifts the right
wing while Poss pokes. -

COONEY (CONT'D)
And above_all, make sure nobody exploits
you. Really, "thirty percent’s a small
price to pay.

DAG
Thirty percent of what?... Hey!

Dag’s caught Poss in the act. Cooney scrambles to cover...

COONEY
He's pest checking your measurements,
you'll need some new outfits. First we
jet you a stylist, some good pictures, I
now some guys, I’ll get you a deal.
Then we'll get you a personal trainer...
(off Dag’s reaction)
You’re no spring chicken, bubbe, those
drumsticks need definition. All at
minimal cost, a small investment in your
future, how much money do you have,
anyway, and where do you keep it?

Actually, r aeinda left home in a hurry
today. I didn’t bring any cash.

Cooney and Poss trade looks -- and change moods. Cooney
flexes his claws, grabs Dag by the shoulders.
COONEY
Listen, 2°, rube, this is the City, you
wanna make it here, it costs money. Now

are you gonna help us help you? Or do we
have to shake it outta you?

Cooney shoves frightened Dag against a wall. Then... the
raccoon’s expression changes from menace to pain.

COONEY (CONT'D)
Yow!

REVEAL mockingbird Mack has landed squarely on Cooney’s head,
grabbing a furry ear in each claw.

MACK
geagney)
You dirty overgrown furry rat --
let him go, or the ears come off.
(digs in; Pacino/Scarface)
I‘ll rip em off and shove em up your
nose, say goo’bye to your leetle yeriends!
16.

COONEY
Yaaaaaaa, get off me!

He releases Dag. Scared Poss or dies onto his back, playing
ossum. As Cooney escapes grabs Poss’s tail and drags
im along, racing out o the al ey. Mack looks Dag over...

MACK
New in town, kid?

DAG
How’dja know?
MACK
Lucky guess. Just fell off the turnip

truck, huh?

DAG
No! ...I jumped off.

MACK

Yeah? What’s your name, kid?
DAG

Dagnabbit Shuddup.

MACK
Hey, shuddup yourself, I was just asking!

DAG
That's my name, Dagnabbit_Shuddup.
That’s what the farmer calls me, anyway.

 

MACK
Hunh. How’s about I call you Dag?
(extends a wing) |
Mack the Mock, stand-up comic and stand-
up bird, at your service.

DAG
Wow. You’re in show biz?
MACK
Don’t tell me -- just where you wanna be.

AG
I never really thought about it til Mr.
Cooney said..

MACK
Yeah well, forget anything that con-
artist tells ya.

DAG
I suspected he wasn’t quite on the level.

MACK
What tipped you off? The burglar’s mask?
The prison-stripes? Or when he tried to
mug ya? Listen, kid, this town’s full of
guys like Cooney, happy to take all the
lough while you do a the work. You got
a sweet souni kid, but you need some
street-— smarts, stat. You got a job yet?
Maybe I can help. Follow me!
17.

He spreads his wings and takes off. Dag watches him go.
After a beat... Mack returns.

MACK (CONT'D)
What ’samatter?

DAG
Can't fly.

MACK
Oh yeah, roosters, right, I knew that.
Okay, I’1l go slow so you can keep up.
Hey, you know how to get to Birdland?

DAG
«..Practice?

MACK
Heard that one, hunh? Come on...

As Mack takes off, Dag double-takes...

DAG
Birdland? We’re going to Birdland?
And he races out of the alley...
EXT. CITY STREETS - MONTAGE - TWILIGHT

DAG’'S POV - A HUNDRED PAIRS OF LEGS, towering above and
clomping past him as he navigates the city sidewalk. Dag
escapes the crunch to hug a wall -- scans the sky...

Perched on a streetlight, Mack waves at Dag, flies on.

DAG dodges an oncoming CYCLIST -- lands in the path of a
SKATEBOARDER, who swerves in the nick of time. DAG spins as
the skateboard whizzes by... to find himself face-to-face
with... a PACK OF SLOBBERING, GROWLING DOGS.

DAG
Brakkkk!

He turns and runs. The Dogs YAP and charge after him.
Luckily they’re on all leashes held by a hapless DOGWALKER...

DOGWALKER
Heel! Heel! HEEL!

From a telephone wire, Mack sees the Dogwalker dragged by his
dogs as Dag makes his escape.

MACK
Hey Dag! Grab a cab!

Dag spreads his wings and takes a flying leap onto the a
parked car -- and from there a passing YELLOW CAB.

SPLAT! From the CABBIE’S POV -- as Dag lands and immediately
gets flattened across the windshield, wings oustretched.

CABBIE
Hey! Move ya stupid bird...
18.

Dag tries to smile at the Cabbie -- until the WINDSHIELD
WIPERS start up, whipping him back and forth across the
windshield. He scrambles to climb up to...

THE ROOF OF THE CAB -- where he almost tumbles off -- but
curls his claws around the “TAXI” signs and hangs on.

MACK'S POV - Dag perches atop the cab, riding through heavy
traffic up a street that looks a lot like Broadway. As the
cab stops at a light, we swoop down, circling above Dag...

MACK
Take a right!

Dag eyes the crossing traffic, takes a running leap into a
TRUCK. Going in the wrong direction.

MACK (CONT'D)
Your other right! This way!

Dog reconnoiters, jumps onto a car headed the other way, digs
his claws into the canvas top. He searches the sky for Mack.

MACK (CONT'D)
Right behind ya.

Dag yelps, surprised. Mack has landed on the car top.

MACK (CONT'D)
We get off at this next...

The car hits an_ intersection and SQUEALS to a stop -- sending
our heroes tumbling off.

EXT. STREET - TWILIGHT

Dag and Mack land hard, rolling on the pavement. Luckily
they’re stopped. : « WHAM! WHAM! By the trunk of an enormous
tree. As they struggle to their feet, Dag looks up to see..
GOTHIC CATHEDRAL TOWERS (think St. Patrick’s) soaring above.

DAG
We're going to church?

MACK
Quite the contrary.

He taps on the massive tree-trunk with his beak. A speakeasy-
style PEEPHOLE OPENS. Glinting eyes and a GRUFF VOICE:

VOICE (0.S.)
Yeah? Oh, hiya Mack.

A DOOR opens in the trunk, revealing the Club Bouncer inside--
COCKY CACCIATORE, a burly, greying rooster.

MACK
Dag, meet Cocky Cacciatore. The Cocky
Cacciatore.

DAG

Yeah? Wow.
19.

COCKY
He never heard of me.

DAG
Sure I have.
(off Cocky’s stare)
No I haven't.

MACK
He was World Cockfighting Champ five
years running is al

COCKY
“Was” being the key word. Can’t expect
kids to know ancient history. Hiya, Dag.

They shake wings. Mack and Dag step inside. Cocky sticks
his head out, yells upward

COCKY (CONT'D)
Okay, fellas.

PAN UP TO REVEAL four big, burly NIGHTHAWKS perched on
branches above -- each harnessed to a rope that passes into
the tree and down to the elevator. The Hawks flap and take
off in four directions... pulling the elevator up.

INT. ELEVATOR
As it rises, Cocky studies Dag.

COCKY
Kinda past your bedtime, ain’t it?

MACK
Think we got a nightbird here, like you.

COCKY
Yeah? Happy to welcome another freak of
nature. You come to the right place kid.

MUSIC begins as the elevator stops. Doors open to reveal...
INT. TREETOP LOUNGE - TWILIGHT

Dag gapes like Dorothy in Oz as he enters Birdland, even more
spectacular than its postcard. On the gargoyle- framed stage,
a_chorus line of NIGHTINGALES rehearse as the Crow Bar ban
plays and a fey jaybird (BUSBY BIRDLY) directs.

NIGHTINGALES
Nightbirds!
You came to the right birds,
This place will ignite, birds,
When we get hot!
And we get hot a lot...

ARTIE CAW
Callin’ all nightbirds,
All you blackbirds and white birds--
Wanna hit a new height, birds?
This is the spot!

Eying Dag, Busby sings along with the chorus...
20.

BUSBY & NIGHTINGALES
You feeling blue, bird?
Lost all your spark?
Cheer _up, boy, and come enjoy
Some laughter after dark!

Mack smiles fondly as he mutters to Dag:

MACK
He’s a screaming jaybird, but he puts on
a helluva show.

Dag is in jazz heaven, chicken-dancing along to the band...

DAG
Man, they’re great! I can’t wait to play
with them.

MACK
Hunh? Aw, no, kid, you’re not workin
with the band, you’re gonna be a busbird.

DAG
(trying to hide disappointment )
Oh! Well that’s good too. I mean, I’1l
still be kinda showbiz... adjacent.

DISSOLVE TO:

DAG - now wearing a red busbird’s jacket, as Mack finishes
tying Dag’s bowtie. REVEAL we're in...

INT. BIRDLAND KITCHEN

Dag stands at the end of a line of Waiters and Busbirds as
the NIGHTHAWK MAITRE D’ inspects his staff, singing:

MAITRE D’
Another busy night, birds!
So don't get uptight, birds --
No fights and no flight, birds --
Stay on your toes!

The Waiters do a quick tap-break, twirling their trays. Dag
joins in clumsily, following their lead.

MAITRE D’ (CONT'D)
The customer's always right, birds!
So keep it polite, birds,
And see that tonight, birds,
Everything flows!

The Waiters perform a balletic routine, assing their trays
down the line... to Dag, who ends up holding the whole stack.

DISSOLVE TO:

DAG - LATER - navigating with his tray through a PACKED HOUSE
-- drunken LOONS, cuddling LOVEBIRDS, GULLS in sailor hats
and macho NIGHTHAWKS chirping up NIGHTINGALES and DOVES. The
Club's open, and it’s hopping. As Dag clears plates...

DAG
Who knew there were so many...
Nightbirds?
21.

DAG (CONT'D .
there pi § just. a-light-bite birds...
s up big bowls)

And £5 appetite birds!

He checks out the ENORMOUS PIGEON who polished off the bowls.

DAG (CONT'D)
He gives new meaning to eat-like-a-bird.

He moves to another table, where dandified, drunken LOONS
laugh as they drop empties on his tray.

DAG (CONT'D)
I see high-as-a-kite birds...

Moving to another table, where a party of HUMMINGBIRDS lie
across the tabletop, claws up, deeply asleep.

DAG (CONT'D)
And out-like-a-light birds...
spoken)
can't old their nectar.
(grins, , sings)
And all of ‘em nightbirds,
Just like me!

ON THE STAGE - as the Chorusbirds sing:

NIGHTINGALES
It's time to stay. up late, birds --
So bring a hot date, birds,
Or hunt for a mate, birds,
Right here and now!

ON MACK - now cuddling up to a matronly OWL in the front row.

MACK
Hey, I found her! Wow!

NIGHTINGALES
No reason to wait, birds,
So don't hesitate, birds --
There's gaggles of great birds
Right here, and how!

Mack joins Artie and the band for a splashy finale, as the
chorusbirds do a G-rated “fan dance” with peacock feathers.

MACK
Yeah, only the preferred land
Here -- in -- Birdland!

They bring their fans together... then cascade them apart to
reveal a REAL PEACOCK, taller than anyone else on stage, He
spreads his regal tail as a dazzling backdrop for the finish.

EVERYBODY
Come fly with the --
Nightbirds!
Here we're allowed to be nightbirds!

ON DAG, in back, wowed by the show and singing softly along.

DAG
And we're proud to be niahtbirds!
22.

MACK
What a crowd! Yeah --

EVERYBODY
Nightbirds are the right birds to be!

The crowd WHISTLES, CROWS and CLAPS THEIR WINGS as the
curtain falls as Mack takes the mic:

MACK
Thanks everybody we're gonna take a
little brea! but stick to your perches,
we got two more shows!

DISSOLVE TO:
DAG - still dreamy-eyed as Mack approaches...

MACK (CONT’D
So ya like the show, kid? Stupid peacock
keeps missing his cue, there’s a guy got
hired for his looks.

Suddenly Mack stiffens at the sight of Paulie Crackers and
Red -- the parrot and rooster we saw with Cap’ n Pluckett.

Mack and Paulie glare, feathers ruffling. ey know each

other. And don’t like what they know.

MACK (CONT'D)
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

PAULIE
(“hello Jerry”)
Hello... Mack.

MACK
("hello Newman” )
Hello... Paulie. Dag, Paulie Crackers.
He used to be in showbiz, but he couldn’t
make it. There’s just one Bird of a
Thousand Voices. He’s only got twelve.

PAULIE
Joe Pesci)
I didn’t like showbiz. Because I am not
a clown. Do I look like a clown to you?

MACK
Honest answer?

PAULIE
Showbiz is for clowns. I’m managing
fighters now. Like the champ here.

MACK
Good for you. Come on, Dag, time to
meet the boss.

As he pulls Dag away, Mack points upwards -- through the
leafy canopy -- to the church tower soaring into the night.

CUT TO:
AN UPSIDE-DOWN POV OF MACK

MACK
Dag, this is Mister “Bats” Amore.
23.

DAG
(gasping for breath)
It’s... a... pleasure...

INT. BELFRY TOWER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

“BATS” AMORE -- yes, he’s a bat, in formalwear -- drops from
the rafter he’s hanging from, flips upright to look Dag over.

MACK
He had to take the stairs. Roosters,
they can’t fly, you know.

BATS AMORE
Yeah, I know. And another thing the
can’t do? They can’t stay awake! The
last one slept all night.

MACK
This kid’s a nightbird like Cocky. He’s
a real dynamo... normally.
DAG
(still panting)
You gotta... lotta... stairs.
BATS AMORE

Johnny! Get him some water.

JOHNNY GUANO, a brawny, brainless bat, fills a glass from a
rainspout -- and SPLASHES it in Dag’s face.

BATS AMORE (CONT’D)
To drink, you idiot.

DAG
That’s okay... felt good.

BATS AMORE
My associate, Johnny Guano. And you are?

DAG
Dagnabbit Shuddup.

BATS
.-Dagnabbit, what did you say to me?

MACK
(hastens to intervene)
His name is Shuddup, long story, Mr. A,
with which we will not bore you, call him
Dag. Give him a try-out, hunh?

BATS
Show me what you got tonight. Then we'll
talk turkey.

JOHNNY
Hey, that’s good boss. Talkin’ turkey to
a chicken.

BATS
You know about “three strikes you're
out?” Here you only get one. Johnny --
give the kid a ride down.
24.

INT. BELFRY TOWER

Johnny glides down on outstretched wings past winding stairs,
holding nervous Dag in his claws. As they hit bottom...

JOHNNY
Watch your step Rooster.
(then, guffaws)
Get it? Your “step,” ‘cuz you can’t...
DAG

‘Cuz I can’t fly, yessir, funny.

With a WHOOSH of wings, Johnny circles back up to the shadows
as Mack flies down, lands by Dag.

MACK
Hey, be careful with these guys. You
know why they call Mr. Amore, “Bats?”

DAG
-..’cuz he’s a bat?

MACK
Because he’s bat-poop insane. So from
now on? Let me do the talking. You just
keep your eyes open and your beak shut.

Dag nods eagerly -- eyes wide open, beak tightly shut.
INT. TREETOP LOUNGE - NIGHT - LATER

A SNACK BIRD passes with a trayful of STIFFENED WORMS,
hawking her wares like a cigarette girl in a human club.

SNACK BIRD
Centipedes... millipedes... worms...
centipedes... millipedes... worms...
BATS

Over here, sweetheart.

Bats and Johnny now occupy a_ leafy booth overlooking the
club. Bats plucks a big millipede from the Snack Bird’s tray
-- bites off the head and spits it out like a cigar tip --
and starts nibbling. He flips a coin onto the tray.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CLUB - Dag maneuvers through the crowd
with a full tray. He hears a FANFARE, looks to the stage...

MACK
My friends, get ready for a trip to the
moon on the gossamer wings and the silken
voice of Miss -- Flo -- Nightingale!

The curtain parts to reveal FLO NIGHTINGALE in all her

glittery glory. Packed into sequins, she’s one hot chick.
The band plays an INTRO, she opens her beak to sing, and...
CRASH! The band stops. Flora stops. ALL EYES turn to...

Dumbfounded Dag, who has dropped his tray.
25.

Everyone reacts -- CUSTOMERS laugh and hoot... Bats and
Johnny narrow their beady eyes... Flo stares... then smiles.
FLO

Now that’s what I call a reaction.
(crowd laughter)

One more time, boys.
(to Dag)

And honey? Easy on the percussion.

Dag stares at the stage, goofy-beaked and dreamy-eyed.

The Band strikes up the fanfare again. Flo sings: “NEVER
TRY TO CLIP MY WINGS”

FLO (CONT'D)

Shy? Me?
(sultry laugh)
Try me.

But once we're done, let's turn the page--
When our time's flown by,

Then I gotta fly...

‘Cause this bird don't sing in a cage!

You can date me,

You can hate me,

Just don't incarcerate me.

Keep adorin' me

Tilt you're borin’ me,

Just never lock the door on me.
You can woo me,

Pursue me,

Do ooh, so many things,

But never try to clip my wings.

Flo slithers offstage into the front row, where she sings to
admiring nightbirds -- a tipsy Loon, a tough-guy Nighthawk.

FLO (CONT'D)
‘ma lover, not a fighter,
‘ma kisser, not a biter,
‘m a lovebird just as long I'm free!
Hold me Lightly, not too tightly --
Maybe every other nightly?
And onew me how ya Tove to fight for me!

oken)

Take (Spe Artie...

BAHN

THE BAND swings into its musical break. As Artie starts
wailing his clarinet solo...

DAG starts to bop with the music. With the full tray held in

his wings, he shuts his eyes, sways, steps, spins... and
bumps b indly into the SNACK CHICK, who tumbles into a table
of drunken LOONS -- who laugh as worms fly everywhere.

Mack rolls his eyes, hurries to control Dag...

Too late. As the music soars, Dag’s throat puffs... his
wattle wobbles... and he lets loose his own jazzy CROW.
DAG

Ek-ek-ek-ek-ek-arooooo!

Possessed by the music, he hurls his tray into the air...
26.

Mack races to catch the tray -- then uses it to catch the
glasses tumbling through the air.

Artie BLASTS his clarinet to drown Dag out... but Dag just
blasts right back:

DAG (CONT’D)
Erkaroo-erkaroo-erkarooo-ak!

Mack catches a bowl on his head -- and misses the last glass,
which CRASHES to the floor.

The MUSIC STOPS. Artie has stopped playing to stare at Dag.
Bats and Johnny are staring, too. So are all the customers.

Dag’s oblivious as he blissfully CROWS. Eyes closed, he
doesn’t notice Mack tugging his wing. So Mack sticks his
beak straight into Dag’s ear...

MACK
Dagnabbit Shuddup!
Dag’s eyes open. His beak closes. Sees everyone staring...

ARTIE CAW
May we continue? A-one-two-three and...

The MUSIC cranks up as Johnny approaches angrily.

MACK
What can I say, the kid likes music.

JOHNNY GUANO
Yeah? He screws up again, you’re both
gonna be hearing angel music.

Mack looks to see if Dag gets the message... but the
rooster’s staring dreamily at the stage as...

Flo returns to the mic. She winks at Dag as she sings:

FLO
You can kiss me,
Or diss me,
Or buy me diamond rings,
But never try to clip my wings!
(big finish)
You can grip me,
Unzip me,
And don't be reluctant to tip me!
But never -- ever -- clip
My wings.

The crowd goes wild. Flo takes her bows...
Mack corners Dag, beak-to-beak.
MACK
What’d I tell ya? Eyes open, beak shut.

And what do you do? Shut your eyes and
open your stupid beak! I oughta...
27.

RED (0.S.)
Hey baby, I‘’1l1 unzip ya!

Mack and Dag look to see...

Red, the hulking | rooster who came in with Paulie, now lurches
drunkenly from his ringside seat to the stage...

RED (CONT'D)
I’‘1ll unzip ya and tip ya, how about that?

FLO
Okay, hon, I wasn’t singing just to you.

Flo tries to exit gracefully, but the Rooster grabs her.

ON MACK - seething.

MACK
I’‘1ll handle this, Dag. Dag?
Dag’s already gone. Mack reacts to SQUEALS and CRASHES...

--.as Dag leaps from one table to another, charging straight
for the STAGE. Red barely has time to react...

ROOSTER
What the...?

...-before Dag barrels into him. Feathers fly and the
roosters roll straight into the bandstand. Artie and the
crows SQUAWK and take flight as Dag and Red smash into the
drum set. Dag’s head plunges through the bass drum. Red
sits Up fast-- and CLANGS his head against the cymbals. POP!
Dag pulls his head out of the drum.

ROOSTER (CONT’D)
Hey! You know who I am?

DAG
Yeah you’re the guy who was just leaving.

Dag grabs Red by his wings -- hoists him to his feet-- and
hurls him off the stage onto a table. Food and drinks go
flying. So do the Loons who were sitting there. The table’s
at the end of a branch -- it bounces as Red lands.

Dag jumps from the stage to the table -- bending the branch
down further. As he lands briefly...

DAG (CONT’D)
And stay out!

Dag jumps off. The branch snaps back up, catapulting Red
into the air. Everyone in the club watches Red rise up, up,

up...

CRUNCH. Red SLAMS against an overhanging buttress. Everyone
watches him tumble down, down to the street below.

Mack smiles at Paulie..

MACK
So much for your chump, sorry, champ.
28.

Paulie fixes Mack with a beady, malevolent guare. - then
spreads his wings and dives to help his fallen champion.

CAMERA-LENS POV - LONG SHOT of the chaos in the club. The
CAMERA IRIS ADJUSTS and ZOOMS IN ON DAG...

REVERSE SHOT - of a hole in the trunk of the Birdland tree,
high above the club floor -- the penthouse. TWO ORANGE EYES
GLOW within the darkness, irises tightening to focus on Dag.

BACK TO SCENE: Artie and the crows put the bandstand back
together. Flo and Mack support Dag as Bats and Johnny
approach.

JOHNNY
Okay, that’s it, you’re outta here.

FLO
They were just trying to help. Which is
more than some bats I know.

JOHNNY
Mind your Manners, you're talking to a
mamma’

FLO

Yeah, well, I didn’t see any mighty
mammals racing to my rescue.

(to Dag)
Thanks, honey, are you okay?

BATS AMORE
Not for long he’s not.
(moving in on Dag)
That guy you just bounced...

JOHNNY GUANO
“Bounced,” that’s good, boss...

BATS AMORE
Do you know who he was?

DAG
No sir, funny, he asked me the same
thing, not even he knows who he is.

BATS AMORE
He’s Ready Red O’Reilly, the Rhode Island
Redneck, the world bantamweight cock-
fighting champ, that’s who!

DAG
Well, sir, I couldn’t have.
(delayed reaction) |
The world-which what-fight who now?

BATS AMORE
Too complicated for you? How’s this?
You're fired. Heave-ho.

Dag is devastated. Flo and Mack hold their beaks as Johnny
grabs Dag and spreads his wings to carry him out.
29.

VOICE
Heave whoooocc-hooo?

Everyone’s startled by the appearance of...

DON OWLEONE - owner of the bright orange eyes, an old,
Brandoesque owl, soft-spoken and hard-nosed.

DON OWLEONE
No heave-ho without my say-so.
(stares at Dag)
Tell me, my cocky young hothead, just
whoo-hoo do you think you are?

DAG
Dagnabbit Shud...

MACK
(intervenes )
His name is Dag, sir, Dagy meet Don
Owleone. A-K-A the God-feather.

MUSIC UNDER - as Artie and the Crows play a plaintive Italian
ballad to underscore the Don’s scene.

DON OWLEONE
That was a very gutsy display, Dag,
knocking out the bantamweight champ.
You’re an impressive young hooooligan.

DAG
Oh I just got lucky, sir. Most roosters
get pretty dopey this time of night.

DON OWLEONE
But not you. You’re a natural nightbird,
aren’tcha? Roohoosters like you are rare.
Have you ever fought professionally?

DAG
Gockfighting? Me? Oh, no, sir. I’m
just... well, like Miss Flo sings, “I’ma
over, not a fighter.”

; DON OWLEONE
Miss Flo, hmm?

JOHNNY
If the Don wants you to fight, you’l1l
fight.

DON OWLEONE
Who-hoo asked you? You heard the bird.
Can't make him fly against his nature.

DAG
Especially when he can’t fly.

DON OWLEONE
I like you, rooster. Tell me, can I help
you in any way?

DAG
I’m just happy to be here, sir. Of
course, I'd love to work with the band.
30.

DON OWLEONE
I’‘1ll_ talk to Artie. And perhaps one day
I will ask a favor in return.

As the old owl turns from Dag, he murmurs to Bats...
DON OWLEONE (CONT'D)
There’s more than one way to pluck a
chicken.

EXT. HOTEL BROADWAY - DAWN

A vertical neon sign blinks “HOTEL”. In the channel between
the sides, nest-boxes rise up like Japanese hotel-cubicles.

In the lowest “room,” our friend Homer is waking up. He
waddles to the open front of his cubicle -- turns Fis
tailfeathers to us, squats over the edge. As we PAN UP away
from the pigeon going potty, we hear...

PEDESTRIAN BELOW (0.S.)

Hey! Yuck.
We RISE PAST other RESIDENTS -- pigeons waking up --
nightingale gargling on her way to bed -- two Lovebirds
cuddling and cooing -- and finally, at the top...

DAG lies in his cubicle, listening. The morning birds CHIRP.
Sirens BLARE. TRAFFIC builds. He stares over the waking
city, toward the farm he left behind. Garish neon flashes
across his face. Alone for the first time, Dag looks scared.
He pulls a POSTCARD from beneath his pillow, starts writing.

DAG (V.0.)

Dear Penny -- well, I got work! At

Birdland! It’s beén some ni ht, but
Penny, you’re gonna love it eré...

CUT TO:
THE SAME SCENE, UPSIDE DOWN

REVEAL JOHNNY GUANO hanging from a nearby tree branch,
watching Da He squints in the rising sunlight, pulis
sunglasses rom beneath his wing and puts them on.
JOHNNY’S POV - of Dag, now shaded in night-vision green.
INT. DAG’S ROOM- MOMENTS LATER
Homer takes Dag’s postcard, puts it in his bag.
HOMER
Okay, I’1l get it to her pronto. And
make sure she gets to you.

DAG
Thanks, Homer.

HOMER
Dude, we're all in the same flock, right?

He spreads his wings and takes off.
31.

EXT. ABOVE THE CITY - EARLY MORNING
Homer soars above the skyscrapers...

DAG (V.0.)
The city’s like nothing you ever saw. I
can’t wait for you to get here.

EXT. FARMLAND PASTURES - DAY
Homer flies above a pastoral landscape. He squints, puzzled.

HOMER'S POV - Dag’s farm is now surrounded by BARBED-WIRE
FENCING. Signs warn: KEEP OUT... UNDER CONSTRUCTION...
PLUCKETT’S POULTRY IS EXPANDING! Flying lower, Homer sees...

The Farmer and his Wife load furniture and boxes loaded on
their rickety truck... while Pluckett watches from his big
car, smiling as two of his MEN load cages onto another truck.
Homer heads in for a landing...

EXT. THE FARM - DAY

The cages on the truck are full of HENS... including Penny.
PENNY
Homer? Homer!
HOMER
Hey Penny -- special delivery.

He passes postcard through the bars. She passes one back.

PENNY
Thank goodness, can you get this to Dag?
They lost the farm! They're leaving.
And they’re leaving us... to him.

She gestures up to the billboard above, where the giant Cap’n
endlessly chews his giant drumstick.

HOMER
No! We gotta get you outta here!

Homer starts to peck at the cage latch. Then... BLAM! He
YELPS and flaps wildly as a bullet just misses him.

PLUCKETT’S MAN
Scat, ya dang air-rat!

The Man holds a SMOKING RIFLE. He shoots again... BLAM!
Homer leaps into the air as the bullet whizzes beneath him.
With Pluckett’s other Man in the driver’s seat, the truck
REVS to life and starts to move. Homer flaps above...

HOMER.
Don’t worry, I’ll get Dag...
(BLAM!
Yow! We’ll get you out!

BLAM! Homer soars skyward... as the gunman climbs aboard the
truck... and the truck heads out the gate.

PENNY

Hurey Unmartl wnrrvt
32.

EXT. HOTEL BROADWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
Homer lands atop the sign, hops into Dag’s cubicle.

HOMER
Dag? Hey, Dag...

He notices a leathery black blanket spread over Dag’s nest.

HOMER (CONT'D)
Love what you’ve done with the place,
sort of a cowboy goth vibe. Dag?

He doesn’t see the “bedspread” start to enfold him -- as
Johnny Guano sits up, wrapping his wings around Homer.

JOHNNY GUANO
He ain’t here. Got called to work early.
Where ya been, pigeon?

He grins -- exposing those shiny fangs. Homer gulps.
EXT./INT. TREETOP LOUNGE - LATE AFTERNOON

The Crow Bar Band members are gathering, swilling coffee and
warming up on their instruments, as Dag approaches.

ARTIE CAW
Well if it isn’t Mister Steal the Show.
Meet the other crows, that’s Russell on
drums-- Cheryl on keyboards-- and the Old
Crow himself on bass.

Russell and Cheryl wave. The Old Crow lifts a pint flask in
toast, swigs some down.

ARTIE CAW (CONT'D)
The management tells me you're working
for us. But let’s get clear here, you’re
at the bottom of the pecking order, dig?

(illustrates on piano)
Here/s me. = h

ays hi note

then 810°Grows )

(lower notes)
Then Cheryl, then Russell...

(the lowest note of all)
Then you. Got it?

(off Dag’s nod)
You just_get what we need, sit in on
rehearsals and one gay Maybe -- maybe
we'll let you jam with us. Gotta work
your way up. Ya start out shovelin’
elephant poop -- but then one day --
you’re the elephant. You dig, Dag?

(then, gently)
I heard you out there, you got a gift.
But you gotta learn to give back. You
wanna play jazz, you gotta be a team
player. Nightbirds look out for each
other. So just pay attention, dig?

But Dag’s distracted by the arrival of... FLO. Even without
spandex and spangles, she looks good. Maybe better.
33.

ARTIE CAW (CONT'D)
+..Dag? You dig?

DAG
Hmm? Oh yessir, pay attention, I dig.

FLO
Hi, boys, Cheryl! Hey, my hero! Never
caught your name.

DAG
§speechisss with infatuation)
D-d-duh. D-d-duh..

ARTIE CAW
Dag, meet Flo, Flo, Dag.

FLO
Nice to know ya, Dag.

DAG
My p-p-puh. My p-puh-puh.

FLO
Mine too. Thanks for putting that big
cock-a-doofus in his place.

ARTIE & CROWS
Yeah, his flat-on-his-face place! He had
it coming! I was gonna take him out
myself, but you beat me to the punch!

Dag basks in good fellowship. Flo pecks him on the cheek.
He blushes through his feathers, as the Crows caw raucously.

FLO
Aaah, they don’t know squat about how to
treat a lady. Chivalry was dead in this
dump before you showed up. So thank you,
my nightbird in shining feathers. You
ever wanna go out after the show some
time, I'll elaborate on my gratitude.

With a last, devastating wink at dumbstruck Dag, she’s off to
the dressing rooms. The crows are still cawing...

ARTIE CAW
Okay, settle down, cats. Dag, you pay
attention and work hard, and we'll al
make some crazy music together.

DAG
Work hard, yessir, I will.
(still gazing after Flo)
Mister Caw? Could I get tonight off?
The Crows grin and caw good-naturedly.
INT. BELFRY TOWER - NIGHT

UPSIDE-DOWN SHOT of sweating Homer finishing story.
34.

HOMER
-..and I said I’d tell Dag and we'd save
her but if she’s headed for Pluckett’s I
figure she’s probably plucked already and
that’s all I know I Swear please don’t
hurt me I got kids to feed!

REVEAL this time the bats are upright -- it’s Homer who's
upside-down, strung up with the strap of his own mailbag.

BATS AMORE
You don’t have any kids.

HOMER
...I know some kids.

BATS AMORE
Okay, let him go, Johnny.

Disappointed, Johnny unstraps Homer who THUDS to the floor.
Bats reads from the end of Penny’s letter...

BATS AMORE (CONT’D)
“Dag --_come back! Need your help!”
(malevolent inspiration)
Hunh. Johnny -- think you can forge this
chicken-scratch?

JOHNNY GUANO
Sure, boss.

BATS AMORE
Let’s put a “don’t” here... and one
here... and we’ll add a nice P.S.

Off Homer, helplessly watching the bats hatch their scheme.
INT. FLO’S DRESSING ROOM
As Dag knocks and enters...

DAG
Miss Nightingale?

FLO
Dag? Over here. And call me Flo.

Dag looks toward a DRESSING SCREEN... just as a dress flips
over the top. He gulps.

DAG
Oh, I can come back later...

FLO
Relax, honey, I’1l be right out.

A slip flips over the screen. Dag tries to stay cool.
Next... a bra. Dag’s feathers ruffle.

FLO (CONT’D)
Didja come to make that date?

Flo emerges in a kimono-style robe. Dag exhales loudly.
35.

DAG
Oh, Miss -- Flo, believe me, I’d love to,
but... I got a girl back home.

FLO
But she’s back home, right? And I’m
right here.

DAG
You sure are. But I’m kind of a one-hen
rooster.

Flo retreats, regards him with a new eye.

FLO
Fresh off the farm, aren’tcha? You are
adorable.

DAG
Thanks, Miss -- Flo. You, too.

HOMER (0.S.)
Dag? You back here?
(appears in doorway)
Oops, am I interrupting something?

FLO
Sadly, no.

HOMER
Dag -- we gotta talk.

Sounds urgent. Flo watches Dag exit with Homer. BLUESY
MUSIC UP: “NEW BIRD IN TOWN.”

FLO
New bird in town,
Dumb as a tourist,
Green as the purest cornball corn...
New bird in town,
Fresh as a farmyard morn...

EXT. CATHEDRAL - DUSK

Homer and Dag perch beneath a gargoyle. Dag looks devastated
as he reads Penny’s postcard - Homer avoids his pal’s eyes --
he’s a bad liar and feels awful about deceiving Dag.

DAG
“Don't come back. Don’t need your help.
PS - I’ll be safe at Pluckett’s. A nice
rooster named Red has taken me under his
wing.”

 

 

HOMER
Wow, that was fast.

DAG
Did you talk to her?

HOMER
No, well, yeah, I mean, not for long, she
just said, um, “Tell Dag I’m sorry.”
36.

DAG
Yeah. Me too.

As Dag turns away, Homer almost collapses with the effort of
lying. Suddenly... Dag leaps off the ledge.

HOMER
No, don’t, she’s not worth... it.

Homer sees Dag has landed on another gargoyle right below.

DAG
I just need some alone time.

And he hops to a lower gargoyle... then a lower one... on his
way to the street below.

EXT. THE STREET BELOW - TWILIGHT

MUSIC MONTAGE - As Flo sings “New Bird in Town”, we see Dag
and Penny, lonely and abandoned in their new homes.

FLO (V.0.)
New bird in town, left on his only,
So lost and lonely

At every turn...

CITY STREETS - DAG waddles past a movie theatre, looks up at
the POSTER, a wedding scene -- the groom has his arm around
the bride -- and the bride has her arm around the best man:
“THREE’S A CROWD!” Dag moves on, nearly gets creamed by...

THUNK -- a pile of tabloid newspapers landing in front of a
NEWSSTAND. Dag blinks at the headline: “JENNA CATCHES BRETT
CHEATING!” He hurries on.

FLO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
New bird in town,
He's got a lot to learn.

AT PLUCKETT’S - PENNY’s in her cage as the truck pulls into a
LOADING DOCK. She looks up at the towering walls of cages
rising on every side, like a maximum-security prison.

IN THE CITY - DAG avoids PEDESTRIAN FEET as he slogs through
a busy intersection much like Times Square. Above him,
brightly-lit billboards blare their ads:

For mouthwash -- “Can't Get the Girl? Get Freshex!” (Dag
cups a wingtip around his beak, sniffs his breath.)

For cologne -- “She’ll Never Tell -- But Maybe You Smell.”
(Dag lifts a wing, sniffs a pit.)

For jewels: “If You Don’t Treat Her Right Someone Else Will.”
Dag sags, moves on...

FLO (CONT'D
So far from what you knew
So far from love so true,
So far from your old ‘hood,
And so far, kid, not so good...

AT PLUCKETT’S — GRINDING MACHINERY cranks up. Penny ($0 SQUAWKS
as Pluckett’s man lifts her cage and hanas it on a ho
37.

It swings and sways, tossing Penny back and forth, as it
lifts her cage up, up, up to join the other prisoners.

IN THE CITY, Dag perches on a railing watching happy hour
humans going in and out of a bar. He sees a_ gentle tug-of-
war, as TWO GUYS argue over who's faking a a GIRL home. The
Girl rejects one, heads off with the other The loser stands
helplessly as couples swarm around him.

Dag blinks away a tear. He knows how the guy feels. Then..
THUNDER rumbles -- and rain starts falling. The two lonely
hearts, rooster and human, are drenched.

AT PLUCKETT’S, Penny’s cage drops with a CLANG into a space
between other cages. She peers through the shadows at her
prison-mates -- ragged roosters, hopeless hens, dead chickens
walking. The huge metal door DROPS -- plunging Penny and the
prisoners into darkness. MUSIC CARRIES OVER as we

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. DON OWLEONE’S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

A shadowy tree-chamber reminiscent of the Godfather’s gloomy
Tahoe spread. Cockfighting posters and celebrity-bird photos
hang on the walls. Owleone sings to Bats, Johnny and Flo.

DON OWLEONE
New bird in town,
Innocent creature...
He needs a teacher,
Gentle but stern...

Flo realizes he means her. She shakes her head, “forget it,”
and backs away... into Bats and Johnny.

BATS / JOHNNY
Don't let us down,
He's got so much to learn.

OWLEONE
Whooo knows, the city’s nitty-
Gritty might start lookin’ pretty...
Whooo knows, he may discover
He's a fighter, not a lover.

FLO
Aw, leave the kid alone.

Owleone swiftly wraps a claw around Flo’s neck.

DON OWLEONE

Don’t tell me what to do-hoo! Now here’s
the scoo-hoop. The title bout is coming
up at Pluckett’s place, and his boy Red
has been a shoo-hoo-in. Til last night,
when I saw our boy shoo-hoo the shoo-in
out. I saw a chance to take the title
from Pluckett at last. Lots of money to
be made, Flo. We can all dip our beaks.

(releases Flo, sings)
New bird in town--
New champ emerging!
With the right urging...

(to Flo)
That's your concern.
38.

OWLEONE / BATS / JOHNNY
New bird in town,
We got a lot to... earn.

INT. TREETOP LOUNGE - NIGHT

Mack anxiously checks his watch as the Staffbirds prep to
open. He hears the elevator door open...

Drenched, raggedy Dag steps out. Mack hurries to meet him...

MACK
Where ya been, you’re late..

DAG
Just a minute, Mack.

He struts past with unusual determination, as Mack follows.
INT. FLO’S DRESSING ROOM
Flo’s at her mirror making up as Dag knocks and enters...

DAG
Miss, um, Flo? Is that offer still open?

FLO
How’s tonight?

Flo smiles, stands, runs her wing through Dag’s comb, gives
him a lingering kiss on the chee

Mack watches from the doorway with mixed reactions --
surprise, worry, jealousy. Mostly jealousy.

MACK (V.O.)
You ask me, you two need a chaperone.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Dag changes from his busboy jacket into a tux. Mack paces.

DAG
Aw no, she’s safe with me.

MACK
It’s not her I’m worried about. Thought
you was a one-hen rooster.

DAG
Well, one at a time.

MACK
(hands him a comb)
Better comb that comb. You sure you know
what you’re getting into, kid? A date
with 26 ain’t cheap, how are you gonna--

DAG
I thought maybe you could float me a loan
til payday? “I’m good for it.

Mack sighs, pulls out his wallet. As he hands Dag money:
39.

MACK
Sure, kid, but is she good for you?

DAG
Whatsamatter, Mack, you jealous?

MACK
Me? Jealous? Of who? Me? Come on!

FLO
Ready, Dag?

Flo's at the door, radiant in clingy gown. Dag and Mack gulp.
INT. ELEVATOR

Cocky’s riding Dag and Flo to ground level.

FLO
All the way down, Cocky.
(to Dag)
I’m gonna show you a side of the city not
many daybirds get to see. The underside.

Cocky pulls a lever, opens a trap door. Dag and Flo drop...

DAG
Brkaaaaaaaaaaaa..... !

INT. SEWER PIPE
Flo and Dag slide through the twisting pipe...
INT. SEWER MAINTENANCE STATION

And land -- BOING -- ona bigs discarded mattress in a dank
cement chamber. NIGHTBIRDS flock everywhere, moving to...

WATER-TAXIS bobbing on a glistening river of sewage -- a fake
pirate ship, a fake Egyptian barge, etc. The GONDOLIERS are
costumed RATS, calling to the nightclubbers...

GONDOLIERS
Set sail for the Pirates Club! Take the
Ship of the Desert to the Oasis of the
Sewers! Nero’s Castle, right this way!

Flo and Dag board a boat shaped like a tunnel-of-love swan.
MUSIC UP as their little boat sails into the darkness and we
start a jazzy MONTAGE -- Flo and Dag’s big night out.

INT. SEWER “STRIP” - NIGHT

IN THE BAR - a COCKTAIL BIRD serves drinks in blossom-shaped
cups. Flo says, give ita try: Dag dips his beak... makes a
yuk-face. Flo laughs and sucks her drink dry.

IN THE CASINO - Dag plays roulette. He wins! As Flo hugs
him, he slurps a drink -- getting a taste for it.
40.

FLO
New bird in town,
Lucky beginner...

DAG
Wow, I'm a winner,
Money to_ burn!
(spoken)
Let it ride.

Dag loses. As the stack of chips is raked away...

_. FLO
New bird in town,
You got a lot to learn.

IN THE ARENA - Dag and Flo sit ringside at the cockfights.
(Unlike real fighting cocks, our animated roosters wear
boxing gloves on their wings, using their claws mostly for
fancy footwork,] Ready Red O’Reilly, the hulking rooster Dag
threw out of Birdland, is handily creaming a smaller rooster.

Flo cheers and shouts, totally into it. Dag cringes at
first... then starts to air-box, wishing he could KO Red.

IN THE LOUNGE - Flo and Dag watch “COONEY & POSS, MAGICIANS”-—-
the Raccoon’s sawing his silent partner in half. A COCKTAIL
BIRD flits by, Dag grabs the drinks from her tray.

IN THE CASINO - Dag loses. Flo talks to the RAT CROUPIER --
who picks up a s aking: —-tube nearby. A camera turns its eye
on Dag -- actual a periscope jerry-rigged from tubes and

mirrors. We FOLLOW the elaborate periscope up, up, up to...

DON OWLEONE’S PENTHOUSE - where the owl watches a reflected
image of Dag as Bats talks into a speaking tube.

BATS AMORE
Sure, he works for us, give him as much
credit as he wants.

BACK IN THE CASINO - the Croupier-Rat slides a new stack of
chips to Dag, who can’t believe how generous everyone is.

ACTION BLURS into swirls of light and faces as Dag bets --
the wheel spins -- he loses --"bets -- spins... until the
WHOLE CASINO is spinning along with the roulette wheel -- and
in a flurry of feathers, Dag passes out.

EXT. CITY CORNER WITH DINER - NIGHT

Straight out of the Hopper painting Nighthawks at the Diner.
ZOOM IN ON THE STEPS leading up to the door -- tucked
underneath them is another, much smaller diner. The name,
“Nighthawks,” is painted over the window. Inside an actual
NIGHTHAWK mans the grill as Flo and Dag perch at the counter.

INT. NIGHTHAWKS DINER - NIGHT
Dag guzzles coffee and water as he talks to Flo.

FLO
How ya feeling, honey?
41.

DAG
How much did I lose again? No, don’t
tell me. I kept thinking I was gonna win
it back.

FLO

You and every bird in the house. I
should've stopped you sooner.

DAG
Oh, no, Flo, I don’t blame you. Say, you

wouldn't want to Maybe... go out again?
FLO
Sure.
DAG
And again and again? You wanna be my
girlfriend?
FLO

Whoa, boy, one date at a time. 1/11 be
your “Girl Friday,” how’s that?

DAG
That’s great, Flo. You know, whatever
tonight cost -- it was worth it.

Touched, Flo gives him a peck on the cheek. As we PULL BACK
from thé window into the surrounding night:

FLO (V.0.)
New bird in town...
You've got a lot to learn.

FADE TO:
INT. ELEVATOR - NEXT DAY

Dag’s coxcomb hangs limply over his eyes -- and the rest of
him looks pretty hungover, too, as he rides up with Cocky.

COCKY
Rough night, kid?
(off Dag’'s “shhh,” whispers)
Sorry. Rough night?

Dag nods. Cocky opens the doors, and Dag steps into...
nny and Bats -- who shove him back onto the elevator.

BATS AMORE
Boss wants a word with you.

INT. ELEVATOR / DON OWLEONE’S PENTHOUSE

The elevator doors open_to reveal Don Owleone pinning a MOUSE
to the floor with one claw.

MOUSE
It wasn’t me, I swear it wasn’t me!

DON OWLEONE
Could you give us a moment, Cocky?
42.

Cocky nods, closes the doors. An awkward beat as they all
wait. Dag reacts to blood-curdling MOUSE SCREAMS offstage.
Cocky and the bats stay deadpan.

DON OWLEONE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Okay, avanti!

Cocky opens the doors. No sign of the mouse, but the Owl is
licking his claw.

DON OWLEONE (CONT'D)
Had to be done. He was a squealer.
(then, to Dag)
We meet again, my young friend. And in
such a short time, you have run up a
hooooo-huge debt.

DAG
Guess I got a little carried away.

DON OWLEONE
You spent like a drunken seagull.

DAG
Whatever I owe you, please, take it out
of my salary.

Bats slides beads on a bird toy, using it as an abacus.

BATS AMORE
It ain’t chicken-feed, chicky. Let’s
see, minimum wage timés maximom hours,
carry the six, you'll be all paid up in
thirty-seven years.

JOHNNY GUANO
What about the vig, boss?

BATS AMORE
Oh, thank you, Johnny, yeah, adding the
interest, that’1l be -- fifty- three

years. How long do roosters live anyway?

JOHNNY GUANO
Depends. On how quick they pay their

debts.
Johnny grins, revealing GLEAMING FANGS. Reaches under a wing
to pull out... a STEEL FILE. As he sharpens his fangs...
DAG
What are you gonna do to me?
BATS
This kinda money, we gotta at least break
a drumstick.
JOHNNY GUANO
At least.
He lunges for Dag’s thigh... but before he connects, Dag lets

loose with a pre-emptive CROW of pain.

DAG
Rawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwkakak !
43.

The sound echoes loudly, making both bats cover their ears.

JOHNNY GUANO
Yow! Knock it off!

BATS AMORE
We got sensitive ears! That throat-a
yours is a loaded weapon.

DAG
I just don’t wanna get... fanged.

DON OWLEONE
Perhaps I can suggest an alternative.

He gestures a wing towards one of the Cockfighting posters.

DAG
Cockfighting?! Aw no, like I told you...

DON OWLEONE
A lover not a fighter, yes, you seem to
have loved away a lotta loot last night.
And aside from the urgent question of how
you'll repay us... you need to consider
your own fu-hooture.

Dag nods, staring into the owl’s HUGE EYES. Don Owleone’s
linking gaze and mellifluous voice start to hypnotize Dag.

DON OWLEONE (CONT'D)

How do yoo-hooo hope to feather the nest
of Ms. Nightingale, who-hoose company and
tastes are, shall we say, not fru—hoogal?
Five fights and you! ve paid us off. Win
the title, you’ll be roo-hoosting on a
mountain of moo-hooooolah.

DAG
(echoes, entranced)
Moo-hooolah.

DON OWLEONE
Yes, moo-hoolah. Now snap out of it.
(SMACKS Dag with a wing-tip)
Have we got a deal?

DAG
Sounds like an offer I can’t refuse.

DON OWLEONE
That’s the spirit.

DAG
I still don’t know squat about fighting.

COCKY
You will.

Cocky Cacciatore steps out of the elevator.

DON OWLEONE
Meet your trainer.

Cocky leads Dag and Mack through rubble...
MACK
-Just think about it before you go off
ail halt- cocked, no pun intended. ~“Cock-
fighting’s a brutal... scary.

Mack and Dag stop short at the sight of...

ROOSTERS -- sitting silently around the shadowy, overgrown
playground. On the jungle-gym bars. On the swing set. On
the seesaws. They’re everywhere. Just... brooding. It’s a

scene straight out of Hitchcock. And like the humans in “The
Birds,” Dag and Mack move past them very quietly. Then.

COCKY
All right, lazybirds, up and at ‘em!

Cocky’s shout wakes the roosters -- they weren’t brooding,
just sleeping, As they rustle and stretch to life, Cock
points to a sign made from two other signs: “HOT WINGS GYM.”

COCKY (CONT'D)
Let’s go, what are ya, a buncha daybirds?

Dag watches wide-eyed as the other Roosters ease into their
routines... chinning on the monkey-bars, weight-training on
the see-saws, sparring in a sandbox roped like a boxing-ring.

COCKY (CONT'D)
‘Course, most of ‘em are daybirds. They
gotta gobble chicken-speed just to stay
awake. But you, you’re a natural. Here,
these should fit ya.

He hands Dag a pair of boxing gogioves « As Mack helps fit them
over Dag’s wingtips, Cocky picks another piece of gear.

COCKY (CONT’D)
And try this on for size.

Dag reacts in horror at the sight of the MUZZLE Cocky holds.

DAG
.-I have to wear that?

COCKY
League rules, so you lugs don’t peck each
other to death. Relax, it won’t hurt.

But Dag looks anything but relaxed as Cocky buckles it on.
Now Paulie and Red enter the gym.

PAULIE
Hello... Mack.
MACK
Hello... Paulie.
(Bogie)

Of all the gym-joints in all the world,
you had to walk into mine.

PAULIE
What brings you here?

MACK
pal’ s training to kick your boy’s

Paulie and Red recognize Dag Paulie’s eyes narrow -- Red’s
double-comb stands up like demon-horns.

PAULIE
Oh, the battling busboy - You know you
jest, got lucky, don’tcha? You can’t beat
ed in a fair fight.

DAG
Red? From Pluckett’s?
(makes a connection)
Did you steal my Penny?!

PAULIE
Whoa, my boy didn’t steal nothin’. But
if you're that hard up for cash...
(flips Dag a coin)
Here’s a whole nickel.

DAG
I mean my girl Penny! At Pluckett’s!

RED
(taunting)
Hey, all the hens go for me. I don’t
always get their names.

Both roosters drop into fighting stance and face off,
circling. Paulie and Mack move to pull their fighters apart.

COCKY
Okay, boys, save it for the ring.

PAULIE
(Mr. T)
I pity the fool fights us!

MACK
(Brando)
Yeah? My boy’s gonna be a contender!

PAULIE
(Brando)
With a one-way ticket to Palookaville,
he’s a bum, is what he is!

COCKY
Huh. Dueling Brandos.

Now Paulie and Mack are facing off like their fighters...

MACK
(Clint)
Ya feeling lucky, Punk? Well are ya?

PAULIE
(Clint)
Go ahead -- make my day.

Mack and Red drags Paulie away...

MACK

Hasta la vista, baby!

PAULIE
(Arnold)
Ve'll be back!

EXT. GYM - LATER

Cocky watches dubiously as Dag works out on a punching-bag --
a STUFFED RUBBER CHICKEN hanging from a jungle-gym bar.

COCKY

Okay, take a break. Your heart ain’t
really in this, is it?

(Dag shakes his head no)
Just as well, it ain’t something
wanna do forever. Don’t wanna end up
punch— drunk. I know some old roosters
can’t tell a chicken from an egg. Much
less which came first. They start
forgetting things, repeating themselves,
and you know... forgetting things,
repeating themselves.

(off Dag’s reaction)
Joke. I was lucky, I got outta the game
before I got too goofy. But the sooner
your re out, the better. Okay, tr _this --
hink about somebody you’re mad a’

Dag squints at the punching bag, where PENNY’S FACE appears.

COCKY (CONT'D)
Somebody you really hate.

Dag shakes his head -- he doesn’t really hate Penny. So he
imagines RED next to Penny on the punching-bag, grinning as
he wraps a wing around her.

Dag snarls. His coxcomb rises. He pulls back and PUNCHES!
The bag goes spinning around the bar.

COCKY (CONT'D)
That's more like it.

As Dag punches the bag harder and faster...

INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - AFTERNOON

Penny dozes in her cramped cage as LOUD MACHINERY grinds into

to SQUAWK wildly. What’s going on??!!

WIDE-SHOT of the plant shows a whole row of cages now movin
on a conveyor belt, toward a CHUTE. A METAL DOOR ROLLS UP Lo
reveal a glimpse of the PROCESSING PLANT beyond-- flickering
red shadows and an INFERNAL CACOPHONY of CLANGING MACHINES.

REVEAL Penny’s in a row of cages moving toward the chute.

IN THE FRONT CAGE - A terrified hen presses into the back
wall of her cage, SQUAWKING...

POV SHOT - through cage bars, crawling like a roller-coaster
before the plunge. We move inexorably to the edge of the
belt -- TIP off -- land with a CLANG in the chute -- and
slide down, down into the gaping maw of the processing plant.

PENNY cowers in her moving cage, covering her ears against
the din of GRINDING GEARS and CRAZED CHICKENS.

EXT. GYM - LATE AFTERNOON
Cocky watches Dag tapping lamely at the bag.

COCKY
You don’t exactly have the killer
instinct, do ya?

Lover not a fighter, yeah, okay, Plan B.
You like music, right? So let’s teach

you to dance.
CUT TO:

A RECORD spinning on old phonograph near the ring. A scratchy
version of NEW BIRD IN TOWN plays.

Cocky and Dag sing as they dance around the ring. Cocky
feints and keeps the rhythm as Dag ducks and skips away.

DAG
New bird in town...
Stronger each minute...
I'm gonna win it!

COCKY
Keep moving. . « turn!
Keep your head down!

Dag ducks -- then looks up to Cocky for approval. Instead...
POW! He gets a glove to the beak.

COCKY (CONT'D)
You got a lot to learn.

Whew -- I can’t keep this up all night.

COCKY
You won’t have to.

It's that chicken-speed I told ya about.

DAG

Van daan't+ want ma ta nea i+!

COCKY
Nah, that’s the beauty part, you don’t
need it. Most of these daybirds have to
use something, just to keep ‘em going.

He points out other ROOSTERS around gym -- ONE is gobbling
chicken-speed -- ANOTHER guzzles from a “Starcock’s” cup -- a
third is bending over to get an injection in his tailfeathers
from a STORK, who uses a reluctant hummingbird as a needle.

COCKY (CONT'D)
Chicken-speed... caffeine-a-cino...
rooster-booster shots. Now let’s gay
somehow they don’t get the right pick-me-
up to wake ‘em up... they’1ll run outta
steam in no time. All you gotta do is
keep dancing til they droop, then-- blam!
Go in for the kill.

But isn’t that cheating?

COCKY

HOMER on the roof, calling down through an air vent.

HOMER
.-Homer.
49.

In b.g. fans spin, chimneys spew smoke and that big billboard
keeps cranking -- a NOISY MOTOR moves giant Pluckett’s giant
hand, lifting that giant drumstick up and down and up.

PENNY (0.S.)
Homer? Oh thank goodness, where’s Dag?

HOMER
Um, he can’t make it, Pen, he’s uh, ina
little jam of his own, but never fear,
Homer’s here, I’m gonna get you out!

PENNY (0.S.)
. -How?
Her plaintive question echoes up the vent -- how, how, how?
HOMER
Right. How.

He looks down the vent -- fan blades block the way. Looks
around the roof -- smokestacks belching smoke... a few sealed
skylights... no way in or out. Suddenly the roof RUMBLES --

fan blades spin faster-- the plant’s cranking up again...
INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY

Penny’s cage STARTS MOVING on the conveyor . As the cages
ahead of her head for the Chute of Death...

uelp! PENNY (0.S.)

EXT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - ROOFTOP - DUSK
Homer launches into the air, flies to...

THE BACK OF THE BILLBOARD -- where a motor turns a rubber
belt that moves the giant hand out front.

Homer lands on the moving belt... skitters... then clamps his
claws around the belt. He beats his wings against the air as
he strains to pull the belt off its gears...

-and finally yanks it off-center, onto the sharp edge of of a
gear. The belt starts to SHRED... then RIPS! Homer

wildly backwards and does a midair somersault to avoid t e
torn belt snapping back at him.

ON THE BILLBOARD - The giant hand falls iinp, and the huge
drumstick drops out... CRASH! Through a skylight, into...

INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - CONTINUOUS

Glass SHATTERS and the big drumstick falls straight into the
main bank of CONVEYOR BELT GEARS -- which GRIND and SCREECH,
chewing up the drumstick til only the bone sticks out.

The conveyor belts lurch to a stop... and so does Penny’s
cage, teetering on the edge of doom. A moment of silence,
then... the CHICKENS erupt in giddy CHEERS AND LAUGHTER.
Homer flutters down from the broken skylight...

PENNY
Homer! Over here!
50.

He flies to join her, lands on atop her cage -- the wrong
end, making it tilt over the edge. So he hops to the other
side, weighting it down.

PENNY (CONT'D)
Thanks.

_. HOMER
Let’s just get -- you -- outta -- here.

He pulls on the bars of Penny’s cage, trying to widen the
gap... can’t do it. Turns to the door -- sticks his beak
into the keyhole, tries to pick the lock... and gets stuck,
Struggles to free his beak, pushing against the cage with his
claws. POP! He’s free... but the cage tips dangerously.

Homer flattens his back against the cage and, flapping
valiantly, pushes it back to safe ground. Whew. Then...

The MAIN DOOR of the plant ROLLS UP to admit Pluckett and his
Men, checking out the noise. As usual, Paulie rides on
Pluckett’s Shoulder while Red and General Lee follow at his
heels. The Men tote rifles and flashlights, spraying bright
beams around the cages like searchlights at a prison brea

CAP'N PLUCKETT
What in tarnation....?!

He sees the drumstick and the damage done. Hears chickens
still cheering and laughing.

CAP‘N PLUCKETT (CONT’D)
Awright, hush, ya dumb clucks!

One Man SHOOTS into the air. BLAM! The chickens go silent.
CAP'N PLUCKETT (CONT’D)
That’s better. Now how soon can we fix
this mess and git up and runnin’ again?
We got chickens to fry

Penny looks at Homer anxiously. He looks back helplessly...
then ducks behind her cage as flashlight beams sweep past.

MUSIC UNDER: the OPENING FANFARE of the “ROCKY” THEME.

CUT TO:
DAG'S TRAINING MONTAGE - MUSIC builds as we find Dag at...
EXT. GYM - LATE AFTERNOON
He pushes against a bar attached to the layground whirlygig

while he runs in circles. Cocky rides the whirlygig, crowing
encouragement along with the MUSIC:

COCKY
Gonna fly now! Gonna fly now!
DAG
(panting)
Very... funny...

ANOTHER PART OF THE GYM - Mack and Cocky | watch Dag pounding

51.

EXT. ACME NOVELTY WAREHOUSE - DUSK

Mack's intrigued, Dag puzzled as Cocky leads them through the
fence-bars, into the dark, looming building.

INT. ACME NOVELTY WAREHOUSE

Shelves and racks full of gag toys. Cocky leads Dag to an
area where rubber chickens hang with other birds like the
slabs of beef in Rocky Balboa’s freezer. Dag checks out the
rubber roosters... ducks... BATS. Dag’s eyes narrow ...

BLAM-BLAM-BLAM - Dag beats up on a rubber bat with new
ferocity, as Cocky shouts encouragement.

ANOTHER PART OF THE WAREHOUSE - Mack’s in prankster heaven as
he’s surprised by a pair of wind-up teeth... fooled by a pool
of fake vomit... delighted by a shelf of whoopie cushions,
which FART-FART-FART as Mack hops from one to the next.

LATER - the rubber bat is in shreds as Dag cools down, cocky
massaging his shoulders. Mack raises a camera to capture the
moment. Dag and Cocky smile -- and get SPRAYED WITH PATER
from Mack’s gag camera.

AT THE CITY LIBRARY - Dag looks up at the endless stairway

leading up to the library entrance. Dag looks at Cogky -- I

can’t do this. cocky urges him on. Dag jogs forward... then
backward to tell Cocky -- nope, really can’t do this. “Cocky

pushes him forward... and Dag starts up the” stairs.

AT THE GYM - Cocky sits on a see-saw while Dag strains to
push the other end down -- lifting Cocky into the air.

BACK AT THE LIBRARY - Dag’s running up those stairs again,
breathing hard, eyes closed. He hits a landing -- stops --
turns -- opens his eyes to see Cocky, way down at the bottom
of the stairs, cheering him on. Dag grins, turns back, looks
up -- then sags as he sees... the ENDLESS STAIRWAY upward.

It looks longer than ever.

AT THE GYM - Cocky and Mack give Dag a leopard-spotted,
hooded boxer’s robe. Dag unfurls d2 to reveal the name on
the back: KID_ BANTAM. Cocky and Mack turn to reveal their
jackets are also proudly emblazoned KID BANTAM.

THE MUSIC CRESCENDOES as we hit the library stairs again -- A
POV shot climbing up, up, up... to the top of the stairs! We
spin to see the WHOLE CITY spread out below. REVEAL.

We're sharing the POV of a HUMAN BOXER (call him “ROCKY.”)
He raises his arms in triumph, on top the world. Then...

“ROCKY”
Yo! Check out the chicken!

And here comes Dag, dragging and_ huffing up the final few
stairs. He hits the top and collapses, exhausted.

“ROCKY” (CONT'D)
Yo, you got a lotta noive, boid.

picks . Dag up... and raises the rooster over his head, a
dou le-victory gesture. Dag grins goofily as Rocky jumps...
52.

DAG'S POV - the whole city rolling out below him as the ROCKY
THEME CLIMAXES and our musical sequence ends...

DAG
Hey Cocky, I’m flyin’! I’m flyin’!
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GYM - DUSK
As Homer lands -- looks around til he spots -- a figure in

that hooded “Kid Bantam” robe, shadow-boxing in a corner.

HOMER
Hey, Dag., Don’t turn around, I can’t
look you in the eye, just listen. Penny
didn't really write that letter about Red
and “don’t come back,” the truth is,
she’s in trouble, Dag, big..

The figure turns to reveal the face under the hood. It’s not
Dag -- it’s Johnny Guano. Gulp.

HOMER (CONT'D)
.-trouble. Hiya Johnny, that robe looks
good on you.

JOHNNY GUANO
Hiya -- stool pigeon. You know what
happens to stool pigeons?

HOMER
They get their wings clipped?

Johnny smiles -- showing his FANGS. As he closes in on
Homer, we hear RADIO STATIC and RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT sound FX...

WOODY WINCHELL (0.S.)
They call him Kid Bantam, the newest
student of the sweet science.

EXT. RADIO STUDIO - DAY

Nestled in an antenna tower, Radio KJAY is on the air. Wood-
pecker WOODY WINCHELL punctuates his patter with PECKING.

WOODY WINCHELL

...who graduates to the pros tonight.

(PECK-PECK-PECK)
Trained by woot, Cacciatore, three-time-
champ from way-back-when...

(PECK- n PECK- PECK)
Kid Bantam is fresh meat, +or should I say
poultry, and he’s likel 9gt
tenderized by tough bir Keo lo Loco, a-k-
a the Mexican Madman. Who will slaughter
whom? Yours truly Woody Winchell will be
there to find out, see you at the fights!

Woody DINGS a BELL and starts a record playing. MUSIC UP
("NEW BIRD IN TOWN”) as we DISSOLVE INTO:

A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED BOXING MOVIE MONTAGE - in SEPIA TONES
and BLACK-AND-WHITE, with the occasional splatter of RED.
53.

A FIGHT POSTER SPINS TOWARDS US - Spotlit at the bottom of
the card: APOLLO LOCO v. KID BANTAM.

BLINDING FLASHBULBS EXPLODE as Dag heads into the arena,
wearing his “KID BANTAM” robe.

IN THE LOCKER ROOM - Mack opens Apollo’s locker -- finds a
sack of chicken- speed -- switches it for an identical bag.

He slips behind the lockers as APOLLO appears in trunks and
robe -- grabs the bag -- and gulps down its useless contents.

AT THE BOXING RING - Dag and Cocky climb through the ropes,
take their corners. Woody sits_at the press table ringside.
The Referee is Cooney -- while Poss holds up the round-cards.

LATER - The audience full of birds CHEERS as Dag evades
Apollo's punches. Excited Flo sits next to worried Mack.

WHAM! Apollo lands a punch -- Dag spins backwards. Grabs
the ropes for support as Apollo moves in...

CHORUS (0.S.)

New bird in town,

Full of high hopes now...

Oof! On the ropes now,

Can he return?

New bird in town, he's got a lot to...

DING! The bell sounds, Dag and Apollo return to their
corners. Cocky waters Dag down and tends his wound.

DAG
He’s not... getting... tired...

COCKY
Hang in there.

DING! Apollo aims a punch -- Dag ducks -- Apollo stumbles,

off-balance. Shakes his head, blinks -- getting sleepy. He
looks around -- where’s the other guy? -- just as Dag pops up
from below with an uppercut -- SMACK!

Apollo crashes to the ground. Referee Cooney counts... and

ten! He’s out! The referee lifts winner Dag’s wing as Cocky
and Dag’s fans in the audience CHEER wildly.

AT BIRDLAND - a champagne bottle POPS Open as Mack, Flo,
Artie, Bats, even Johnny celebrate Dag’s victory.

ANOTHER SPINNING FIGHT-CARD -- Dag’s moving up on the fight
card: SUGAR RAY LEGHORN v. KID BANTAM. Dissolve to:

THE GYM WHIRLYGIG - OVERHEAD SHOT - Cocky rides the carousel
as Dag runs and pushes, dissolving into:

THE ROULETTE WHEEL at Nero’s Castle -- where slightly sloshed
Cocky and Flo are winning, dissolving into...

THE DANCE FLOOR at Birdland -- OVERHEAD SHOT, as Dag and Flo
spin around the floor in one another’s wings.

OUTSIDE NERO’S -- Cooney and Poss hold flashlights, sweep
them back and forth like searchlights over the Sewer Strip.
Crowds of nightbirds push toward the entrance, under a
marauis that savs: TONIGHT! KID BANTAM V. CLUCKER LANG.
54.

IN THE LOCKER ROOM - CLUCKER LANG is a huge black rooster
with his coxcomb plastered into a Mr. T. mohawk. His big cup
of Starcock’s coffee sits on a table next to him.

Mack_approaches with his own cup. He peels off the “DECAF”
label and places his cup on the table next to Clucker’s.
Mack points at something to distract Clucker. The big
rooster looks away -- Mack switches coffee-cups.

But Clucker suspects the switch, points to distract Mack...
and switches the cups back. Mack points again -- this time,
he doesn’t switch. When Clucker repeats the gag and switches
the cups, he ends up with Mack’s decaf.

IN NERO’S ARENA - Dag and Clucker slug it out. Dag’s on the
ropes -- only saved by the BELL. He staggers back to his
corner, where Cocky sponges his black eye...

DING! The bell rings -- Dag rises -- but Clucker doesn’t.
The big guy has dozed off on_his stool. Clucker’s TRAINER
tries to rouse him -- but only succeeds in pushing him off

the stool. Clucker falls flat on the canvas, sound asleep.
Dag raises both wings, parades around the ring, victorious.

AT BIRDLAND - FLASHBULBS POP and nightbird FANS surround Dag,
now wearing a two-tone Ricky Ricardo jacket and a big shiner.
Mack approaches for a congratulatory ug -- but Dag shines
him on as he pushes ahead toward Flo, o waits with wings
outstretched. They hug as Mack watches, hurt. Dag grabs a
bottle of champagne from the tray of a passing Waitbird...

POP! The bottle overflows with happy bubbles as MUSIC FADES.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. DON OWLEONE’S PENTHOUSE

Owleone’s opening the Don’s Perignon and filling acorn-cups,
as Bats finishes counting money.

BATS AMORE
All here, boss.

As everyone takes a cup of champagne, Owleone raises his...

DON OWLEONE
We never doubted you-hoo. To Kid Bantam!

Flo, Mack, Cocky, Bats and Johnny join the toast.

MACK
And to the happy end of a great career.

DON OWLEONE
“End?” Who-hoo said anything about end?

MACK
Well, Dag did, remember? He’s gonna quit
fighting once his debt’s paid, which is
now, SO...
(lifts cup)
Ta-daaa!
55.

FLO
Quit now? You gotta be kidding.
(wing around Dag)
You're just getting started, aren’tcha?

DAG
Come on, Mack, I can’t stop now. The
championship, you know what that means?

FLO
A million smacker purse is what it means.

MACK
Yeah, of which you get what?

DAG
Twenty percent. Almost half, right?

Owleone, Bats and Johnny all nod vigorously.

MACK
But you’re a lover -- not a fighter.

DAG
(hugs Flo)
Gee, Mack... can’t I be both?

BATS AMORE
Attaboy. To the next World Champion!

Flo cuddles Dag as all toast -- even, reluctantly, Mack.
EXT. CATHEDRAL LEDGE - NIGHT

Dag, Mack and Cocky perch beneath a gargoyle overlooking the
city streets, a little worse for the champagne.

DAG
You get it, don’tcha, Cocky? This is no
time to quit.

COCKY
I gotta vote with the mockingbird on this
one, kid. The longer you stay in the
game, the more chance you’ll get sucker-
punched in the head.

MACK
Or the heart.
(off Dag’s look)
Forget it.

DAG
I could be lucky, like Cocky.

COCKY
Everybody’s luck runs out sometime.
Energy, too. I gotta hit the hay. And
you gotta do what you gotta do. See ya
tomorrow, kid.

Cocky moves off into the shadows beneath the gargoyles...
56.

DAG
Listen, Mack, now I can start making some
real money. Even keep some of it!

MACK
(nods, deadpan)
Almost half.

DAG
And that won’t hurt, with Flo and all.

MACK
Yeah, no dough, no Flo.

DAG
Yeah...Hey, whaddya mean? You saying Flo
only loves for my money?

MACK
No, no, no. Not only.
(Robin Leach)
There’s also the free fight tickets, the
best tables and all the fabulous perks of
the lifestyle of the rich and famous.

You think she’ s some kind of... fly-by-
night... golddigger?

MACK
No! I know she is.

DAG
Take it back.

MACK
Kid, I’m only trying to...

DAG
(collars Mack)
Take it back!

MACK
Okay, okays Flo’s a peach, she loves you
just for being you.

DAG

(ignores sarcasm, lets him go)
That’s more like it.

MACK
But ya still oughta quit fighting.

DAG
ripsy anger)
Yeah (he 1, you know what you oughta do?
You oughta stop telling me what I oughta
do is what you oughta do. Just keep your
thousand voices to yourself and let me
find my own!

MACK
You’re not gonna find it with a muzzle on
your beak.
57.

DAG
I’m a big bird, Mack, I don’t need you
crowding me all the time.

MACK
-..Well, I don’t wanna crowd ya, kid. Ya
don’t have to worry about that anymore.
He stands, flaps his wings... and tipsily falls of the ledge.

DAG
Mack...!

Mack rises back into view, hovering a moment...

MACK
So long, Dag.

He flies into the night sky -- leaving Dag alone.
INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - DAY
Cap'n Pluckett inspects the fixed machinery.

CAP'N PLUCKETT
She’s ready to go?

Off his Foreman’s nod, Pluckett flips the ON switch. The
gears and belts WHIR into action.

Penny reacts in terror as her cage starts to move... off the

end of the conveyor belt... toward the Chute of Doom. Penny

sticks her feet through thé bars and frantically runs against
the moving belt... but she can’t hold out much longer..

CAP‘N PLUCKETT (CONT’D)
Okay, shut her down.

The machinery stops. Penny collapses, relieved.

CAP’ N PLUCKETT (CONT’D)
Quittin’ time, boys we got_a big night
ahead. Y’all ready to rumble?

Pluckett’s men WHOOP and rush to new tasks -- transforming
the plant into an arena.

SERIES OF DISSOLVES: As some men set up a cockfighting
ring... others set up risers and chairs... some lay bets with
Cap’n Pluckett... and two men hoist a painted banner reading:
WORLD BANTAMWEIGHT COCKFIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP.

As Pluckett takes bets, Red and Paulie confer at his feet.

RED
It’s time to pick my prize, Paulie.

PAULIE

Okay, you can pick her -- but ya can’t do
anything with her until...

RED
.-after the fight, I know.
58.

PAULIE
(Burgess Meredith)
Hens weaken legs. Hens weaken legs.

RED
And I know just which hen I want.
(calls out)
Any of you chicks know a cluck named Dag?

PENNY
Dag? Have you seen him? Is he okay?

Red zeroes in on our Penny in her cage -- calls back:
Not for long, baby. I’11 see you after
the fight.

EXT. GYM - AFTERNOON

Dag’s working out on the rubber-chicken punching- bag, as
Cocky holds it from behind. As he jabs bag:

DAG
Shoulda heard -- what he said -- about
Flo -- who does he -- think he is anyway?

COCKY
Okay, easy, save some for the fight.

(keeps "punching hard)
I mean -- t nerve of -- that guy --
tellin’ me -- what to do -- and when to
quit -- and who to date!

Cocky sticks his head around the side of the bag.

COCKY
Okay, that’s enough, kid...

POW! Dag’s hardest punch yet connects with Cocky’s beak.
Off-guard, the old rooster sprawls and lies stil

DAG
Cocky! Aw no...
He kneels at Cocky’s side -- hoists him into a sitting
position -- gently smacks his face with a wingtip.

DAG (CONT’D)
Cocky? Come on, Cocky, wake up now...

The old rooster’s eyes blink groggily open. His head’s still
spinning and CARTOONISH CUCKOOS circle, COO-COOING loudly.
Then Cocky lifts a wing -- and SHOOS the cuckoos away.

COCKY
Stupid birds.

DAG
Cocky, are you okay?
(raises both wing gs)
How many wings am I holding up?
59.

COCKY
That’s easy, um... you know... what’s the
one between one and three?

. , DAG .
Stop kidding around, I’m worried.

COCKY
Relax, you don’t have to worry about me.

Dag breathes a sigh of relief. Then:

COCKY (CONT'D)
Relax, you don’t have to worry about me.

Cuckoos gather around his head once more. As he shoos them:

COCKY (CONT'D)
Say kid, what’s your name again?

Off Dag -- devastated by what he’s done.
INT. FLO’S DRESSING ROOM

As Dag barrels in, the dressing-screen wobbles -- as if
someone has just rushed behind it.

DAG
Flo! You here? I really need to talk...

FLO
I‘1l be right out.

Dag sees her robe slip off the screen... then notices a pair
of BOXER SHORTS also draped over the screen. The shorts are
decorated with little red bats. Dag watches them slowly slip
behind the screen. He hides his reaction as Flo emerges.

FLO (CONT’D)
Hey, champ, how ya feeling?

DAG
Not so good, Flo, Cocky’s all messed _up,
I think I hurt him pretty bad. And I
think I just got hurt pretty bad myself.

Without warning, Dag SLAMS into the screen -- pinning the guy
behind it to the wall

BATS AMORE (0.S.)
Oooff.

Dag lets the screen fall -- revealing Bats in his boxers.
BATS AMORE (CONT'D)

Dag! Good to see ya, this isn’t
necessarily how it looks. I was just --

inspecting the club for -- you know...
FLO

Moths.
BATS AMORE

Exactly!
60.

DAG
Yeah? Where are your clothes?

BATS AMORE
(pretends surprise)
Man hose moths are quick.
Dag looks at Flo, who shrugs sadly...
FLO
I said I'd be your gixt Friday, kid. But
the rest of the week’s up for grabs.
Too hurt to respond, Dag turns to go...
BATS AMORE
See ya at the fights.

Forget the vee ghts! cocky was right.
Mack was right. I shoulda stopped when I
said I woul It's over. I quit.

And he storms out.

EXT. CITY STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON

Dag trudges alone through the streets once more... past the
movie theatre ("SHE DONE HIM WRONG”)... past the newsstand
("BRETT & JENNA BREAK-UP BOMBSHELL!”). Through Dag’s eyes,
the Times Square signs now read: LOSER--DOOFUS--ALONE. ~ Once
again THUNDER rumbles -- rain falls -- and a TAXI blows

through puddles in front of Dag, drenching him with water.

EXT. ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL - DUSK

bag climbs the fire escape... past a sign pointing left:
SPLANT WING... a sign pointing righ 'HERAPY WING... to
chalk graffiti reading “WINGS WING.” “An arrow points UP.

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DUSK

An avian*clinic spreads across the roof -- injured birds lie
in nests arranged around heating ducts, tended by STORK
DOCTORS and NIGHTINGALE NURSES. Dag looks to find...

COCKY - his head bandaged, lying in a comfy nest.

COCKY
Dag! Hey kid, over here!

DAG
Cocky! How ya doing?

COCKY
Oh, fine, the doctors are great. Except
for the big bills. Get it?
(off Dag’s look)
I’m okay, kid. I remember my name. And
yours. And you remember this guy?

HOMER
Hiya, Dag.

Homer lies in an adjoining nest, his wings in casts.
61.

DAG
Homer! What happened...

HOMER
I had it coming, I shoulda never lied to
you. Look, Penny still loves you, you
gotta get to Pluckett’s and save her!

COCKY
Pluckett’s? Hey, you should be there
already -- you got a big fight to fight.

Dag and pals are startled by the arrival of:

BATS AMORE
Right. Whether you want to or not.

JOHNNY GUANO
Figured a sap like you would show up
here. So we came to escort you to the
championship.

DAG
I told you, I’m not fighting.

JOHNNY GUANO
Have it your way.

gohnny opens wide to reveal his gleaming fangs. Bats digs
his claws into Dag’s wings as Johnny moves in for the kill.

DON OWLEONE (0.S.)
Bats! Johnny! Release that roo-hooster!

The bats pull back, startled by their boss’s voice.

BATS AMORE
But Boss, we thought...

DON OWLEONE (0.S.)
Who-hooo told you to think?

Now released, Dag can see what the bats don’t -- it’s not
Owleone talking, but Mack imitating the old owl. Dag talks
over Bats’s shoulder, overplaying a little:

DAG
Thanks, Don Owleone. I’m just gonna
leave now, Don Owleone...

COCKY
Dag -- whaddya mean, you’re not fighting?

DAG
I can’t, Cocky...

COCKY
Can't? You gotta! You promised. Lotsa
folks are counting on you. Betting on
you. Like me. A bird’s word is his
whatchamacallit, you can’t run away now.

As Dag ponders this, Johnny turns to see Mack.
62.

JOHNNY GUANO
Hey look...!

Bats sees him, too. Mack flaps away. Before the bats can
follow, they’re distracted by...

HOMER (0.S.)
Yo Bats, Johnny!

Painfully flapping his wounded wings, Homer hovers above...

HOMER (CONT'D)
I‘1l show ya a stool pigeon!

Bats and Johnny look up... and two BIG WHITE GLOBS of pigeon-
poop drop onto their heads. Ugh, yuk! As they wipe their
eyes, Mack calls to Dag from the tlre escape:

MACK
Let’s go, kid!

EXT. HOSPITAL FIRE ESCAPE - TWILIGHT
Dag runs down the steps as Mack flies behind.

MACK
Hope I’m not crowding you.

DAG
Aw no, Mack, I’m sorry, thanks...

DON OWLEONE
You-hoo’re very welcome.

DAG
Man, you sound just like him, it’s...

DON OWLEONE
Spoo-hoooky?

Dag runs smack into the real Don Owleone, blocking his way on
the fire escape. He clutches Mack in one claw.

DON OWLEONE (CONT’D)
I don’t really sound like that, do-hoo I?

DAG
hake let him go. 1’11 fight your stupid
t. And after I cream that chicken,
I’ a coming for you.

DON OWLEONE
I like your fu-hoory. Your limo awaits.

His eyes flash as he sinks his free claw into the scruff of
Dag’s neck. Owleone takes off, carrying Dag and Mack.

EXT. CITY - TWILIGHT

The streets below look far, far away as Owleone circles, his
prey swinging from his claws. Suddenly he SWOOPS DOWN... and
releases Dag and Homer.
63.

FALLING POV -- Our heroes SQUAWK as they drop out of the sky
and land hard, THUMP! A LID SLAMS DOWN, plunging us into...

INT. DARKNESS
Only the birds’ eyes are visible.

DAG
Oof. Mack, you okay?

MACK
Umf. This is what I get for helping you.

DAG ; ;
Maybe we can open this thing...

The eyes close as the birds GRUNT and STRAIN against the lid.
EXT. CITY STREETS - TWILIGHT

They’re in a basket-trunk attached to the back of Cap'n
Pluckett’s big black car. The lid pops up an inch -- but no
further, thanks to a big padlock. Dag and Mack’s eyes peer
through the gap as the car glides away...

FADE TO BLACK
THUMP. THUD.

DAG & MACK
Hey! Ow! What the...?

Light floods in as the trunk is opened -- then tipped. Dag
Mack fall out into...

INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - ROOSTER PEN

Chicken wire covers this pen on every side and across the
top, which SLAMS down. One of Pluckett’s Men padlocks it.
They’re trapped. Dag looks through the wire to see...

The whole vast prison of Pluckett’s Poultry. Dag is
horrified -- what kind of place is this?

Don Owleone steps into view, outside the wire cage.

DAG
Let us outta here!

DON OWLEONE
Sorry, no can do-hoo. Until you do
something for me -- quid pro quoo-hooo.

DAG
I said I'd fight, what more do you want?

DON OWLEONE
I ware, ou to lose.
£ Dag’s shock)
You’ fg very popular, my friend. So
popular, the odds are five to two-hoo in
your favor. Which means there’s more to
e made betting against you-hoo.

MACK
You can’t do that.
64.

DON OWLEONE
I already have. I bet you’1l go down in
round two-hoo. So you’re gonna go down
in round two-hoo.

DAG
Throw the fight?! What do you think I
am, some kind of human? No sir. You can
make me fight but you can’t make me lose.

DON OWLEONE
Oh, I think I can.

He steps aside to reveal PENNY -- her wings held by Bats on
one side, Johnny on the other.
DAG
Penny!
BATS AMORE
So it’s simple -- lose the fight, or lose

the chickie.

JOHNNY GUANO
Ready to rumble, rooster?

DAG
(gazing at Penny)
Yeah. I’m ready.

PENNY

But Bats and Johnny are dragging her back to her cage.

DON OWLEONE
Remember -- round two-hoo.

Off Dag, torn...

COONEY (V.O.)
Okay, it’s time to pay for your ride!

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET NEAR BIRDLAND - TWILIGHT

Cooney takes money from ROOSTERS and other FLIGHTLESS BIRDS
as they hop aboard a LITTLE RED WAGON.

£ COONEY b

Pay for your ride uy your programs

championship express.

Poss stands nearby, selling programs and taking bets.

COONEY (CONT'D)
Okay, let’s move out.

Poss climbs aboard a TRICYCLE hitched in front of the wagon.

HOMER (0.S.)
Hey wait! Wait for us!
65.

Here comes Homer, his wings in slings, and cocky s on foot.
Cooney grabs their money and helps shove them aboard.

COONEY
Okay, Poss, you peddle, I’1l push!

With a mighty effort, Poss starts peddling the tricycle while

Cooney pushes the wagon from the rear. AS soon as the wagon

gets rolling, Cooney stops pushing and hops aboard.

INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY

Mack is one glum prisoner as Paulie waddles up to the pen.
PAULIE

Always knew you’d end up asa jailbird.
Sorry to hear your boy’s going down.

MACK
Only to save his hen.

PAULIE
Rawk! And ya know what’s funny about
that? When my boy wins -- he gets the

hen. Win or lose, your boy loses.

Paulie laughs raucously as he waddles away. Mack turns to
see Dag’s been listening.

DAG ; ;
In that case... I might as well win.

Dag look angrier and more determined than we've ever seen
him. MUSIC UP - the Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana --
a.k.a. Theme from Raging Bull.

FADE TO:

SMOKY BLACK-AND-WHITE - Dag shadow-boxes alone in the rin
wearing his spotted robe with the hood up, like a fowl del fro
in the famous opening image. FREEZE-FRAME - TITLES OVER:

KID BANTAM
WORLD BANTAMWEIGHT TITLE BOUT

We begin a SERIES OF DISSOLVES in B/W SCORSESE STYLE, full of
slo-mo, freeze-frames and extreme close-ups...

Fight fans arrive at Pluckett’s -- shadowy humans in the
bleachers, birds sitting ringside. B gang of Amore’s BATS
perch on the pillars of the ring, guarding against trouble.
WOODY WINCHELL sits ringside, broadcasting from a wooden
crate labelled PRESS BOX.

Dag suits up -- Mack finishes tying the gloves, reaches for
the muzzle. Dag grits his beak as Mack slips it on...

Red slams back Starcock’'s coffee, one cup in each wing.

WHISTLES and CHEERS as Dag appears. Blinding FLASHBULBS POP!
FREEZE-FRAME PHOTO - Dag raising his wings, all pumped-up.

Dag climbs into the ring -- followed by his new corner-man,
Mack, who gets awkwardly tangled in the ropes.
66.

A MICROPHONE drops from above... into the paw of tonight's
referee, Cooney. He even looks like a stripe-shirted ref.
COONEY
In this corner, weighing in at ten pounds
six ounces -- Kid Bantam!
(CHEERS )

In this corner, weighing in at fourteen
pounds twelve ounces, Ready Red O'Reilly!

Dag and Red tap gloves in a pre-fight “handshake.” Back in
his corner, Dag drops his robe. Looking good. Red drops his
robe. Looking better. Plus he’s caffeinated to his coxcombs
which stick up like horns.

The BELL DINGS. Poss holds up a sign: “ROUND ONE.” Red
attacks first. Dag dances away once... twice...

WOODY WINCHELL
And the Rhode Island Redneck launches his
assault... but he can’t touch the Kid,
look at that chicken duck.

KA-POW! Red connects. Dag STAGGERS IN SLO-MO to the ropes.

WOODY WINCHELL (CONT’D)
Kapow and ouch, talk about cold-cocked,
O’Reilly’s got the Kid on the ropes.

Red POUNDS Dag -- until Dag ducks. Red keeps going lunging
into the ropes -- which stretch and bounce him back...

..-but Red aims his legs squarely at Dag’s chest -- oof! Dag
sprawls onto the canvas. So begins a bruising round for Dag,
fighting as if his life, and Penny’s, depend on it.

LATER - Red’s pummelling our hero hard as the BELL DINGS...

WOODY WINCHELL (CONT’D
What’s black and blue and has Red all
over him, it’s Kid Bantam, and whew, he’s
saved by the bell.

In Dag's corner -- Mack band-aids Dag’s cuts and squeezes
spongefuls of water over him.

In Red’s corner -- Paulie rubs the rooster’s neck while Red
swallows more Starcock’s.

DING! They're up again. Poss raises a sign: ROUND TWO.

SLO-MO SHOTS of Dag taking a beating. Feathers fly and float
through the air. Red stomps on Dag’s feet and slugs him into
the ropes. Dag bounces back like a rubber doll -- and Red
slugs him again. It’s Looney Tunes meets Scorsese... until
Red delivers a KILLER ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH. Dag bounces and
crashes to the canvas. Cooney starts counting -- one, two...

DAG’S BLURRY POV of the crowd -- Don Owleone, smiling. - Flo,
fretful... Bats and Johnny, holding Penny in their clutches.

Dag struggles to get up -- four! five! The CROWD ROAR
grows faint in his head, as he hears:
67.

COCKY
You can do it, kid! You can do it!

Dag blinks his swollen eyes, sees...
HOMER AND COCKY -- ringside, bandaged but rooting loudly.

HOMER
Attaboy Dag, come on, get up!

Seven... eight... Dag drags himself to his feet. The Ref
pulls back -- the crowd GOES WILD.

IN THE CROWD - Don Owleone scowls and seethes.

IN THE RING -- Red moves in on wobbly Dag... but Dag crouches
to_ launch a head-butt into Red’s gut. Red staggers back, off-
balance, and SLAMS into a corner post. CR-RACK. That’s gotta
hurt. As he slides down the post, CUCKOOS circle his head.

IN THE CROWD - Penny’s held by Johnny and Bats, who murmurs:

BATS AMORE
He wins, you lose.
PENNY
(shouts rebelliously)
Come on, Dag -- kill him! Decimate him!
In the ring, Dag looks around to find her... just as Red

swats the Cuckoos and stands up. He barrels toward Dag..
who turns back in the nick of time, and drops to his knees.
Red’s momentum carries him forward -- he trips over Dag and
CRASHES onto the canvas. Dag jumps on top of Red, pinning
him down. Spectators CHEER and lean forward eagerly...

PENNY (CONT'D)
Murder him!!!

SLO-MO - as Dag raises a glove to deliver the final blow...
then STOPS. Instead of hitting Red, Dag sticks his glove
under his other wing, yanks it off. Reactions change from
YAY to HUNH? as Dag uses his free wing to remove his muzzle.

BATS AMORE
What the...? Get him, boys!

The bat guards spread their wings and launch. As they swoop
towards Da - he CROWS. The Bats put their wings over their
ears... “drop to the ground, writhing in sonic pain.

Johnny releases his grip on Penny, but Bats struggles to hold
on. Now Flo decides to help -- she sticks her beak into
Bats’ ear, and SHRIEKS a COLLORATURA HIGH NOTE. It’s more
than Bats can stand -- he releases Penny, covers his ears.

FLO
Move, girl! Go stand by your rooster.

Penny flashes Flo a grateful smile -- then flaps off through
the crowd. Now Flo is startled by a voice behind her:

DON OWLEONE
Oh, Flo, that wasn’t a very smart mooove.
68.

Flo gulps as the old owl clamps a claw around her neck...

In the ring, Dag leans down, beak-to-beak with Red. As he
reaches under Red’s head, his opponent squirms...

DAG ; ;
Relax, I’m not trying to kiss ya.

.-and he rips Red’s muzzle off.

RED
What’dja do that for?

DAG
You’re welcome. Now crow.

A beat -- then Red CROWS. A lovely, operatic tenor trill.

DAG (CONT’D)
Gee. That was unexpected.

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
Fight, dammit!

Red CROWS again, right at Pluckett:

RED
I always wanted to sing -- but you made
me fight.

DAG

Now everybody! Make some noise! Drive
these bats bats!

Dag CROWS along with Red... and the other Roosters join in.
The cock-ophony echoes through the plant. All the bats
SHRIEK and flap wildly toward for the open door. Some fly
into Col. Pluckett, who whacks them away...

PENNY
Dag!

DAG
Penny!

He sees her ringside, pulls her up into the ring. As they
wrap their wings around one another...

PENNY
You really are a fighter.

DAG
When I’m fighting for what I love.
(then, to crowd)
Everybody! Listen!

The Roosters stop crowing. MUSIC UP. Dag sings: "NOBODY
HERE BUT US CHICKENS”.

DAG (CONT'D)
Listen, the clock is tickin’.

RED
I don’t hear nothin’.
69.

DAG
Listen, the time's running out...

Suddenly everyone’s quiet -- listening to Dag.

DAG (CONT'D)
There's nobody here but us chickens--
And us chickens are stricken with doubt.

Caged hens nod and murmur, “it’s true, we are.”

DAG (CONT'D)
Listen! The tickin' quickens...
We're sick an' we're under attack...
But there's nobody here but us chickens,
So it's time to stand up and fight back!

ON PLUCKETT AND HIS MEN - baffled by the non-fighting cocks.

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
Fight, ya dumb clucks! What in tarnation
you waiting for?

BACK IN THE RING - Dag sings to Red.

DAG
Hey my fine-feathered brother,
Let's stop fighting each other,
Let's use our might the right way --
To fight the man!

ROOSTERS
Fight the man!

OLD HEN
But we can’t...

ROOSTERS
Yes we can!

DAG
(sings to crowd)
No more a henhouse divided,
Let's cross the road with pride --
Let's join one another
And march to the other side!

All the Roosters are getting excited now, CROWING
enthusiastically as they batter against the chicken-wire.

Cap'n Pluckett storms to the ropes, eye-to-eye with Dag.

CAP'N PLUCKETT
Who the hell you think you are, Rooster?

Dag looks right back -- extends a wing to TURN UP Pluckett’s
hearing aid -- then CROWS into the speaker:

DAG
Dagnabbit -- Shuddup!

Pluckett is literally KNOCKED DOWN by Dag’s volume. The
chickens CHEER. As Pluckett’s men help him to his feet.
70.

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
I‘1l_ kill you, bird, I will kill you and
chill you and chop you into nuggets!

ROOSTERS
Shuddup! Yeah, shuddup!

CAP'N PLUCKETT
You shuddup! JI own you damn dumb birds!

ROOSTERS
Shud-dup! Shud-dup! Shud-dup!

Dag’s name is becoming a gladiator rallying-cry, like
“Spartacus.” As Pluckett shrinks back, Dag sings:

DAG
Here's where the plot starts to thicken--
Here's where I give ya the scoo,
There's nobody here but us chic. ens,
And us chickens are flyin’ the coop!

ROOSTERS
Shuddup!

DAG
No, really!
Chickens, no iron and brick can
Keep us locked up on the shelves --
But no-one'll rescue us chickens --
Time to start stickin' up for ourselves!

RIP! A corner of chicken-wire gives way under the Roosters’
battering. One pushes through -- then another. They grab
the wire and pul as_more and more roosters break free. But
most of the hens still cringe in their cages...

DAG (CONT'D)
You too, hens! Make noise, get mad!

MACK
Wanna get ‘em mad? Leave it to me.

As Mack takes flight, Pluckett spots the escaping Roosters.

. CAP'N PLUCKETT
Tarnation, stop ‘em!

His Men grab rifles and start down from the bleachers..

High above, Mack lands near a fire-sprinkler. Plucks a piece
of ACME FLASH PAPER from his pocket -- IGNITES it -- and
holds the flame under the sprinkler. WHOOSH! The system
starts up. Sprinklers spin and spray water over all the
cages... making the hens wet, and, yes, mad. They start to
CLUCK and rattle their cages.

The indoor rainstorm cascades down the bleachers. Pluckett’s
men slip and slide down the slick stairs. Other humans start
a slippery stampede for the doors. Mack watches happily.

MACK
Mad as wet humans.
71.

His smile fades as he feels TWO CLAWS sinking into his
shoulders. Paulie Crackers has landed on him.

PAULIE CRACKERS
You are nothin’ but trouble.

Mack pulls another packet from his pocket - ACME SNEEZE
POWDER. He flicks it open as Paulie attacks... and EXPLODES!
AAAACHOOO! CHOO! CHOO! Helpless Paulie releases Mack...
and tumbles off his perch, feathers flying with every sneeze
as he spasms his way to the ground.

In the ring, Dag and Penny shout encouragement to the Hens:

DAG & PENNY
Go girls! Rattle those cages!

Pluckett slips and slides his way to the plant control panel.
He punches the “SPRINKLER OFF” button, grabs the “MACHINE ON”

lever... and since he’s soaking wet, gets ZAPPED with
electricity. General Lee lunges to rescue his master, sinks
his teeth into Pluckett’s leg -- and gets ZAPPED himself.

The sprinklers stop. Pluckett’s weight pulls the lever down.
The MACHINES START as his hand slips free...

HENS SQUAWK as the belt starts moving. The OLD HEN from
Dag’s farm is headed for the chute -- but she SQUAWKS and
rattles her cage so fiercely, it TIPS OVER THE SIDE...

Down below, Pluckett regains consciousness to find General
Lee frozen in mid-chomp on his ankle.

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
Let go-a me, you moron!

General Lee lets go. Then... WHAM! The Old Hen’s cage drops
on Pluckett’s head-- he’s down again. The cage hits the
floor... the door SPRINGS OPEN... the Old Hen is amazed as
she steps out to freedom.

OLD HEN
Hey, look at me!
(sings)
Come on, my fine feathered sisters --
Let's figh the cap'ns and misters!
Shake yourselves free, and we
Can beat the Man!

HENS.
But we can’t!

OLD HEN
Yes we can!

More Hens rattle their cages right off the conveyor belt --
onto Pluckett, his Dog, and his Men. Thunk! Thunk!

OLD HEN (CONT'D)
No more a henhouse divided--
Let's cross the road with pride!

HENS
Let's help one another
And get to the other side!
72.

But one little Hen can’t rattle free -- she’s stuck on the
conveyor belt headed for the chute...
DAG
Mack! Help!

Dag’s struggling to pull the end of the chicken wire off the
rooster-pen. Mack flies to help him. RIP!

As the little Hen drops off the end of the belt into the
fatal chute... Mack swoops and drops the big chicken-wire
net. It catches the Hen’s cage... and BLOCKS the end of the
chute, More cages drop and get stopped by the blockage --
creating a nice big traffic—jam in e chute.

Penny has found her way to a TELEPHONE. She knocks the
receiver off the hook and pecks out nine-one-one.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
As a DEPUTY answers the phone...

DEPUTY
Police.

He recoils from the FRANTIC SQUAWKING at the other end.

DEPUTY (CONT'D)
Whoa, ma’am -- calm down...

ASovers phone, shouts)
Hey Marshall! We got an emergency, I’m
not sure what, but this chick’s in pain.

INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY

Penny backs away from the © phone as Paulie approaches, still
sneezing explosively. eans into the receiver...

PAULIE
Help-choo! Pluckett’s Poultry-choo!
Help, they’re killing us! Choo!

Nearby, the Old Hen leads other fallen hens from broken cages
to the plant door. One Hen carries an egg in her wings...

HEN WITH EGG
Women and children first!

Pluckett spots the hens escaping -- pushes the door-button --
and gets SHOCKED again. As the door rolls down, a few hens
get trapped. Suddenly they’re caught in a BEAM OF LIGHT...

DAG
This way, girls! Fly out the window!

Dag holds a FLASHLIGHT in his claws, uses it to direct the
escapees up a flight of stairs to a small window.

HEN
We can fly?

DAG
Sure we can. We’ve just denied our true
power due to social conditioning!
73.

The Hen jumps out the window. THUD! Dag winces -- then
explains to the camera:

DAG (CONT’D)
Without a false sense of security, she’d
never have jumped.

FLO
Help! Help!

Dag looks up to see Owleone clutching Flo in his claws, as he
dives straight for the open window. Thinking fast, Dag aims
the flashlight at the old owl’s eyes.

Owleone is blinded. His huge pupils shrink to pinpricks --
he SHRIEKS in surprise -- and releases his grip on Flo.

Before she can unfurl her wings, she’s plummeting to the
ground... until Mack swoops down to catch her.

FLO (CONT’D)
Thanks, Mack. I don’t deserve you.

MACK
You got that right.

Owleone CRASHES into cages on the belt. As he recovers, Dag
runs and leaps up to confront him.

DON OWLEONE
Bats! Johnny!

DAG
(moves in on Owleone)
They took off. Not so tough without your
hench-bats, are ya? Yeah, you're real
tough with the hens and the mice, how
‘bout fighting a rooster your own size?

Owleone’s backing away -- then reaches the edge of the belt.

_ DON OWLEONE
Okay, just stay coo-hoool...

POW! Dag slugs him right in the beak. The Owl goes flying
off the conveyor belt -- down the chute -- into oblivion.
DAG
Arrividerci, Godfeather.
BACK TO CAP'N PLUCKETT - as he struggles to his feet...

HOMER
Yo, Pluckett! Bombs away!

Pluckett looks up to see Homer hovering awkwardly above.
and gets a generous dropping of pigeon-poop in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Penny perches on Dag" s back to reach the RING OF
KEYS hanging from distracted Pluckett’s belt-loop.

PLOP! Another Homer-bomb lands on General Lee. He GROWLS
and LEAPS at Homer, catching the low-flying pigeon off-guard.
He chomps on Homer’s wing-tip, shakes him back and forth...
74.

Mack to the rescue. He lands on the General’s back and whips
another packet from his pocket -- ACME ITCHING POWDER. A
quick sprinkling over the dog’s back...

General Lee freezes -- whines -- releases Homer -- and starts
SCRATCHING frantically as Mack and Homer make their escape.

Penny holds the Cap’n’s keyring while Dag pulls off keys and
tosses them to other Roosters. Dag hugs Penny as he sings:

DAG
I found my chick and unloosed ‘er!

PENNY
But the others are still in a fix.
Think there's nobody here but you roosters?

ROOSTERS
Let's go save some chicks!

Dag, Penny and the Roosters flap, hop and run to different
levels of the “prison” and start opening cages. The freed
Hens embrace the Roosters -- then scurry to open more cages.

EVERYBODY
Now we won't stand for slim pickins,
Now that we all know the score!
There's nobody here but us chickens,
And us chickens ain't chicken no more!

EXT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - NIGHT
Bats and Johnny come in for a landing.

BATS AMORE
There’s gotta be a way back in...

THUMP! Something flies out of a “WASTE” chute in the wall
above and lands right in front of the bats. It’s a big chunk
of deep-fried batter -- shaped just like an owl with wings
outstretched. The bats consider their boss’s fried remains.

JOHNNY GUANO
Chicken-fried owl. Wonder what that
tastes like.

(off Bats’s look)
I was just wondering.

INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY

Pluckett is apoplectic -- everywhere he looks, he sees hens
hopping out of their cages.

CAP’N PLUCKETT
Stop those chickens!

Two of his men climb to the edge of the chute. One lunges to
catch an escaping Hen and falls onto the cages that clog the
chute. It’s a little too much weight for the chicken-wire,
which starts to give way. Another Man starts to climb in...

FIRST MAN
No, don’t help meeeeeee.....
75.

Too late. The chicken-wire gives way... and the cages tumble
down the chute, with Pluckett’s men aboard for the ride. As
they slide down to oblivion...

DAG / PENNY / CHICKENS
We're gonna give ‘em a lickin’!
We're gonna drive ‘em all nuts!
There's nobody here but us chickens --
And us chickens are kickin’ your butts!

Woody remains at his microphone amidst the chaos..

WOODY WINCHELL
It’s an unbelievable scene as chickens
take over the poultry plant and their
jailers run for cover, oh, the humanity!

HOMER
(approaching him)
Hey, could you help me with something?

EXT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Woody emerges through a crack in the boarded-up skylight --

and flies behind the PLUCKETT’S POULTRY billboard, where the
giant Cap’n’s arm still swings loosely from its bolt. Woody

ands and starts pecking at the wood that holds the bolt.
RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT...

INT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - CONTINUOUS
Pluckett rages at the free-ranging prisoners...

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
You_can’t escape, dang it! May the hand
of God strike me down before I’11l be
beaten by a buncha bird-brain chickens!

CRASH! Pluckett looks up just in time to see... the giant
billboard hand crashing through the boards above... into the
plant machinery. With plenty of GRINDING and SMOKE, it all
comes to a halt. The chickens CHEER, CLUCK and CROW.

EVERYBODY
You better not mess with us chickens,
We'll fry ¥ You eventually --
There's nobody here but us chickens,
And together we can be free!

BLAM! The jubilant MUSIC STOPS abruptly at the sound of a
shotgun blast. The Cap’n has fired a warning shot. His
remaining Men stand with rifles ready.

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
Now that is enough-a that.

The birds cower from the human weapons. Pluckett draws a
bead on Dag and Penny..

CAP'N PLUCKETT (CONT’ D)
You two troublemakers ain’t gonna make no
more trouble for nobody.

As his finger tightens on the trigger... everyone reacts to
the sound of SIRENS outside.
76.

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (0.S.)
Open up! Police!

Mack flutters up to the door-button and kicks it. The metal
door rolls up, revealing...

POLICE CARS outside, splashing red lights over the night. A
MARSHALL and Deputy approach Pluckett...

CAP‘N PLUCKETT
Everything’s fine, Marshall...

MARSHALL
Afraid not, sir. Sponsoring cockfights
is a crime in this county.

Pluckett turns to face the Marshall, and recognizes...

CAP'N PLUCKETT
Farmer Farmer?!

The Farmer now wears a Marshall’s uniform.

FARMER
Marshall Farmer, now. Had to get a new
job after you shut us down. Let’s go.

He grabs Pluckett’s rifle and produces a pair of handcuffs.

FARMER (CONT'D)
Just doing my duty, Cap’n, doing my duty.
(slapping on the cuffs)
You have the right to remain silent.
(as Pluckett starts to protest)
That means shuddup.

Chickens SQUAWK happily as Farmer drags Pluckett out.

CHICKENS
Shuddup! Shuddup!

EXT. PLUCKETT’S POULTRY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The plant is a_ circus of red Lights and teeming feathers, as
Farmer perp-walks Pluckett to the police car... followed by a
torrent of hens and roosters, making their escape. Cooney
and Poss stand by their tricycle-wagon, pitching:

COONEY
Step right up, buy 2 a seat on the liberty
limousine to freedo
As chickens swarm their way, Poss speaks for the first time.

POSS
This time -- you pedal.

Exhausted, he flips onto his back, playing possum.

We find our heroes emerging into the night. Penny kisses
Dag. Flo kisses Mack. “Homer leans in to kiss Cocky, who
gruffly shoves him away.

DISSOLVE TO:
77.

INT. BIRDLAND - ONSTAGE - NIGHT

We’re back to Mack and his opening monologue. Now we notice
the Treetop Lounge is packed with regulars and NEW CUSTOMERS--
the Roosters and Hens from Pluckett’s.

MACK
True story. So now without further ado,
ladies an gentlebirds and my little
chickadees, here’s the guy you’ve been
waiting for. Hey chickens! Wake up!
Can we get them some coffee? Here he is,
the rooster who coulda been world
champion but settled for seit of cock-a-
doobie-doobie-doo. He’s still a champ in
my books, so make some noise, this kid’s
something to crow about -- Dag Nabbit!

CHEERS as LIGHTS CHANGE -- we see Dag silhouetted behind the
curtain. He lets loose with a BRASSY RIFF...

DAG
Bra-ka-kaw! Bra-ka-kaw! Bra-ka-ka-ka-ka-
kaw-ka-ka-kaw, yeah!

Curtain rises on Dag and band: “NOBODY HERE BUT US CHICKENS.”

Clickin' and cluckin' with glee --
There's nobody here but us crows --

MACK / FLO / DAG
Mockingbirds! Nightingales! Chickens!

SPOTLIGHT frames FLO AND MACK: “NEVER TRY TO CLIP MY WINGS.”
She cuddles him. He’s embarrassed, tries to play to crowd.

FLO
Found a mate --
Worth the wait --
He just might domesticate me...

MACK

Surrendering to Flo's embrace, Mack gestures “move the spot-

DAG & PENNY
Now you and I
Are finally together,
Birds of a feather,
We'll never say goodbye...
And it's guaranteed
We'll never need

They peck -- and the CURTAIN RISES to reveal the Band, the
Chorusbirds, Red, Mack, Flo, Homer, Cocky, even the Peacock.
