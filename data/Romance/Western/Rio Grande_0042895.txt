strung out along the valley road, Riding at the head of the

Wagon train there is no sound or movement in the valley but

atmosphere, as though the wagon train is moving toward some -

in front of it with trees and a horse-trough., From the road
there is a clear view right down the main street of Rio Bravo,
but the barnyard is so placed that it is hidden from the .
viewpoint of anyone looking toward it from the sown. The man
sitting his horse in the middle of the road is the Dude. The
Dude wears a star, a Sheriff's deputy. He is a small man,
almost frail-looking. At one time his name had been a legend
on the Texas’ border. They had talked of his speed with a gun
of his deceptive mild manner, of his friendship with the.
Sheriff, John T. Chance. But that was the past. Now for twp
years Dude has been on the bottle, two years as the town
drunk. He wears a battered hat, ragged clothes, run-down
boots. He is unshtven and very close to the shakes. But for
the time being, under stress, he is sober and desperately

‘efficient. Wheeler rides up to him, but Dude speaks first.

DUDE:
Hello, Mr. Wheeler. Just keep your wagons
moving---tell your men to stay with 'em till
they're told different.

What is all this? Who the hell are you,
ordering me around? First the Burdettes,
