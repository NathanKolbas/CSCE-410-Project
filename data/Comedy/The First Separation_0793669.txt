TITLE AND CREDITS 1

They begin as WHITE TEXT on a BLACK SCREEN to Colin Stetson’s
“In Love and In Justice” - a multi-tonal piece played on a
single bass sax.

The background shifts through the entire color spectrum from
black to violet, red, orange, yellow, green, blue. The
credits shift to the opposite end of the color wheel from the
background, eventually BLACK TEXT, WHITE SCREEN.

The song evolves from its baritone drone to the introduction
of progressive chords, punctuated by quick intakes of air
from circular breathing.

On one of these chords we CUT TO--

EXT. HELLAS BASIN - MARS - EASTERN RIM - DAY 2

A vast, rust-colored plain beneath a pink sky. A smudge of
mountains on the horizon. We hold on the hypnotic beauty of
the emptiness. It could almost be a photograph.

...a faint dust devil in the distance - swirling into form
and disappearing within seconds.

The camera EASES BACK. The move is barely detectable until
something breaks the bottom of the frame - a gnarled tangle
of metal, half-buried, covered with over half a century’s red
dust. Cyrillic script. A Soviet flag.

It’s the Russian Mars 2 Lander, which failed to deploy its
parachute and slammed into the ground 50 years ago - the
first man-made object to touch Mars’ surface.

Then, breaking the top of the frame, a hundred miles away
from us, a bright flare in the sky descends obliquely. As it
breaks the frame - a RESOUNDING CHORD - uplifting and
dangerous - a sternum-rattling chain of notes, as though the
music is willing this object into being.

The flare fades until all that is left is a small, dark
speck. It continues to descend rapidly until - coinciding
with another chord - a supersonic parachute deploys.

We CUT TO MUCH CLOSER as, a few hundred feet above the
surface, a cocoon of balloons inflates and envelops the
speck. The parachute disconnects and wafts away.
The ballooned object begins a free fall. It hits the ground,
bouncing high up again and into a succession of smaller
parabolas, until it finally comes to a rest.

The balloons deflate. Within is a landing pod, a conical
vessel with a rounded bottom scorched by the entry.
Mechanical arms extend outwards from the sides to right the
pod, so the cone is facing up. The cone splits into three
separate plates which rotate outward and down, like the
petals of a blossoming flower.

REVEALING a ROVER - a six-wheeled chassis mounted with
robotic hardware. It has two logos: NASA and VISTA.

With a deep, guttural note from the sax, the rover’s “eye” -
a 360 degree camera at the end of an extended rod - rises out
from the hardware to survey the landing zone. The eye tilts
up, as if awakening.

We CUT TO the Eye’s view - the distant horizon. The song
reaches its crescendo. Then abruptly stops, taking us to:

INT. VISTA MISSION CONTROL - LOS ANGELES, CA - NIGHT 3

The rover view of the horizon on a massive screen above 10
rows of room-wide desks covered with monitors, TECHNICIANS,
SCIENTISTS, and ENGINEERS behind each.

Adjacent to the rover view is a digital map of Mars focused
on the Hellas Basin with a marker for the rover’s location
(and other surface robots and hardware), as well as a second
graphic showing Mars in its entirety and the position of
multiple objects orbiting it.

In the upper right-hand corner are two timecodes marking
Earth and Mars times to the hundredth of a second:

EARTH 6.16.25 16:39:XX GMT
MARS 114.52 13:39:XX MMT

Here on Earth, it is JUNE 16th, 2025, three and a half years
out from the scheduled crew launch to Mars.

We CUT TO Flight Director ALVIN BARRIS (early 50s), and
MARTHA HIRSCH (mid 40s), the Mission Control Director. Both
wear headsets. Low-key and workaday in manner.
ALVIN
Proceed to landing zone.

MARTHA
Go transmission.

COMMS
Command sent. E.T.A for
transmission 9 minutes, 2 seconds.
E.T.A. to target: 2 hours, 12
minutes.

MARTHA
Copy. HAB 1 landing countdown
remains on schedule for T-minus 33
hours, 35 minutes.

We CUT TO the rear of the room where we find LAZ INGRAM (52,
British), the founder and CEO of VISTA, the private space
exploration company teamed with NASA on the venture. He’s
staring at the massive screen, arms folded.

Laz has the bearing of a man in cool command. He’s a
visionary who, like all visionaries, suffers from impatience
but does not suffer fools.

INT. VISTA HQ - PRETESH’S OFFICE - DAY 4

PRETESH KHATTAK (40s, Pakistani-American, the Chief Engineer)
is with his team of engineers, including: MIN ZHOU (Asian-
American, 30s), VIVEK (Indian-American, 30s), GREG (beefy,
white, 20s), and WEI (Asian-American, 20s).

They're watching the rover feed on a large mounted screen,
listening to the audio from Mission Control.

COMMS (V.0.)
Feed incoming.

A moment later, we see the view pan 90 degrees to another
part of the horizon. The assembled watch with awe.

MARTHA (0.S.)
Give me high res and I.R.

COMMS (V.0.)
Commands on deck.
PRETESH
Okay everyone, back to work. We've
got data dumps coming in.

EXT. MARS - HELLAS BASIN - DAY 5

We follow a line of tire tracks in the fine dust, until we
arrive at the ROVER. We come around front and see the tracks
extending to the landing module in the distance.

The rover’s eye tilts down toward the soil. A mechanical arm
swings out with a small drill at the end.

The arm lowers the drill to the surface, whereupon the bit
begins to spin, then descends into the soil. Its whirring and
the screech of pulverized rock the only sounds from here to
the horizon.

We hear another mechanical sound: THE ROAR OF A CHAINSAW.

EXT. ALASKA - 40 MILES NORTH OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY 6
TIGHT on a CHAINSAW biting into ice.

CUT TO a WIDE SHOT to see a parka-clad MAN with the saw at
the center of a large, frozen lake. There’s a snowmobile near
him and a HUSKY darting around nearby.

CLOSER on the man, as he pushes the cut ice through, and
water from the lake bubbles up through the hole.

The man is TOM HAGERTY. He’s 52 but more fit than men 20
years his junior. A peppered beard dominates his face.
There’s a matter-of-factness about him, a sureness and
efficiency to his every movement.

He fixes bait to a hook. Lowers the line into the hole with a
rod. Props the rod up with a forked stick. Takes a moment to
look around at the desolate surface of the lake. It never
gets old - the sublime.

The husky starts to bark. Hagerty glances at the dog, who is
barking in the direction of another ice hole about thirty
yards away. The pole is quivering on its stick.

Hagerty makes his way over. Starts to reel in the line. The
catch breaks the surface. A large rainbow trout. He unhooks
the fish and heads back toward the snowmobile.
TIGHT on Hagerty gutting the fish, the blood spilling onto
the white snow. He tosses some of the innards to the husky
who hungrily devours them in a couple bites.

INT. VISTA HQ - PRESS AREA - NIGHT 7

ROBERT CORDINE (50s) - the NASA LIAISON - is doing a stand-up
interview with a news team.

CORDINE
The rover will confirm our soil
composition estimates and give us a
ground-up view of the landing. But
tomorrow, that’s when
interplanetary colonization really
becomes tangible...

We CUT TO the coverage filling the screen. The chyron reads:
Bob Cordine - NASA Mars Mission Director.

CORDINE (CONT’D)
By landing the HAB 1 module, we're
putting the first technology on
Mars that can support human life.
The tests we do on HABs 1 and 2 -
they’1l improve the subsequent HABs
our crew will call home.

HOLLY O'KEEFE (late 20s), Head of VISTA P.R. - to the
PRODUCER--

HOLLY
Got what you need?

PRODUCER
We’re good. Thank you.

As the Producer shakes hands with Cordine--
HOLLY
(to Cordine)
Plane’s waiting.
Cordine’s ASSISTANT escorts Cordine off.
PRODUCER

(to Holly)
When do I get Laz?
10

HOLLY
I gave you Cordine, didn’t I?

PRODUCER
Cordine isn’t news. Laz is news.

INT. VISTA HQ - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 8
ON Laz again, looking at the big screen.

ALVIN (0.S.)
Laz.

Laz looks to Alvin, who is pointing to Laz’s ASSISTANT over
by the door. She’s tapping her wrist. Time to go.

EXT. FAIRBANKS, ALASKA - HELIPAD - DAY 9

LAUREN GUTIERREZ-HOLT (Latina, late 30s, VISTA’s Program
Director), parka-clad, on her phone. She personifies
competence and authority. It’s very windy. There’s a
HELICOPTER in the background, CHOPPER PILOT beside it. She
has to shout to be heard above the wind.

LAUREN
Tomorrow morning.

LAZ (0.S.)
What was that?

She covers the phone so it’s blocked from the wind.

LAUREN
Tomorrow morning. Earliest.

INTERCUT WITH--

INT. ELECTRIC AUTO-DRIVE MINIVAN - DAY 10 10

Laz in the back talking to the speaker phone. He’s stuck in
bumper-to-bumper traffic on the highway. There is no one in
the driver's seat. The car is driving itself.

LAZ
Maggie’s adamant.
11

LAUREN

There’s nothing I can do about the
weather.

LAZ

Does tomorrow give you enough time
to get back?

LAUREN

Depends how long it takes me to
convince him.

LAZ

Say again.

Gusts of wind are tearing across the tarmac.

LAUREN

I’11 call you when I have the yes.

She ends the call. Approaches the CHOPPER PILOT who was

waiting for

her to get off the phone.

LAUREN (CONT’D)

You sure we can’t try to beat the
blizzard?

CHOPPER PILOT

Hundred percent.

LAUREN
(pointing up)

The sky’s crystal clear.

PILOT

That doesn’t mean shit in Alaska.

EXT. ALASKA - 40 MILES NORTH OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY 11

Hagerty and
picking up.

the Husky are minding the ice holes. The wind is
Hagerty looks toward the sky, now beginning to

fill with an oncoming front of clouds. Decides it’s better
not to remain out here, exposed.

TIME CUT to
fish to the
husky jumps
edge of the

Hagerty packing up the poles and strapping the
back of the snowmobile. He starts the engine. The
onto the back sled. Hagerty drives toward the
lake. The wind intensifies, snow beginning to

slant down from the sky.
12 INT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT 12
Cordine is already on the plane. Laz climbs aboard.

LAZ
Bob.

CORDINE
We could’ve come in the same car.

LAZ
We could've.

As Laz settles into a seat not facing Cordine and uncaps a
waiting bottle of water--

CORDINE
I want to talk about Hagerty.

Laz ignores him. As he retrieves a sleeping pill and washes
it down with the water, the JET PILOT boards--

JET PILOT
Gonna be a little bumpy on the way
out. Fire in the mountains is
throwing up some thermals.

The two men nod and the pilot heads into the cockpit.

CORDINE
Near where you live, right?

LAZ
Wind’s blowing the other way.

Laz leans back and closes his eyes. A beat.

CORDINE
I think we should reconsider.

Laz keeps his eyes closed.

LAZ
Lauren’s already en route.

CORDINE
I just think - from NASA's
perspective - Hagerty’s a wild card
and we should--
13

Laz opens his eyes and drills Cordine with them.

LAZ
We had this discussion. Then we had
it again. We can go for number
three, but I just took an Ambien,
and I’m even more stubborn when I’m
sleepy. Shall we continue?

Cordine says nothing. Laz closes his eyes again.

INT. VISTA HQ - BUILD FACILITY - DAY 13

Pretesh, Min, and Greg are standing in front of the half-
built HAB 3 wearing smocks, surgical masks, latex gloves, and
plastic hair caps. Min shows them a small, rubber washer
encircling a valve.

MIN
We ran the raw data again and our
shake-bake analysis is off. We
favored the wrong results.

GREG
The entry heat could be greater
than its combustion limit.

PRETESH
It’s at least six centimeters under
the shield.

MIN

We're worried about free air.
Greg pokes his pinky finger into the tube.

GREG
Trapped here. Pressure might push
it through the lock.

She points to a coil of nylon rope in a compartment about a
foot away from the valve.

MIN
Could get this far.
(turns back to him)
Which is exactly what I said when I
got outvoted by the other
departments.
10.

14 INT. FAIRBANKS, ALASKA - HOTEL - NIGHT 14

Lauren is on her phone, looking out the window at the
blizzard. On the other end we hear--

CHIEF ACCOUNTANT (0.S.)
About 46 over because of OT this
week.

LAUREN
How can we make it up?

INTERCUT WITH--

15 INT. VISTA HQ - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 15

A glass-walled conference room at the far end of the office
bull-pen. About a dozen DEPARTMENT HEADS gathered.

HEAD ACCOUNTANT
I’m working with Sam on materials.

SAM (HEAD OF PURCHASING)
Avisma will sell us titanium for 10
percent less. It’s a Russian
company, so NASA might not--

LAUREN
You tested the samples?

SAM
Pretesh says they’re good.

LAUREN
Alright, I’1l talk to Bob.
(shifting focus)
Press?

HOLLY
We've got the big four, plus CNN,
Bloomberg, and MSNBC. They all want
one-on--

A knock on the glass. Everyone looks over to see Pretesh. He
mouths “Lauren?” Sam points to the speaker phone and mouths
“On now.” Pretesh opens the door.

LAUREN (0.S.)
Holly?
11.

PRETESH
Hi Lauren - it’s Tesh.
(to the others)
I need the room.

TIME CUT to Lauren sitting on the edge of the bed. She looks
stressed, but not shaken. She glances at her watch.

LAUREN
He’s in the hearing...

PRETESH (0.S.)
I’m not saying we have to stop the
countdown...

CUT BACK to the Conference Room. Pretesh is alone.

PRETESH (CONT’D)
At least not yet. We should have a
better sense in a couple of hours.

LAUREN
Keep the circle tight. I don’t want
this distracting him...

16 INT. WASHINGTON - RAYBURN BUILDING - HEARING ROOM - DAY 16

A closed hearing. Laz and Cordine are seated before the
Appropriations Committee. Seated with them is Senator
MARGARET SAYERS (early 60s, a Republican from Texas). She’s
Ann Richards, if Richards was a conservative. They’re joined
by the NASA ADMINISTRATOR - Cordine’s boss - DEIDRE KENT
(early 50s, politically savvy with the polish of a career
bureaucrat).

The Chairman of Committee is TED WINTHROP (mid 40s, a
Republican from Wyoming). Among others are Rep. HAL SCHNEIDER
(early 70s, Democrat from Massachusetts) and GAIL OGELBY
(late 30s, Republican from Mississippi).

OGELBY
We're getting into double digits.

SCHNEIDER
Billions that aren’t going to
schools, to infrastructure...
12.

SAYERS
Mr. Chairman. Congress has already
committed to this plan.

WINTHROP
We approved 70 billion. Not 80.
That’s 15 percent over-budget.

LAZ
No, it’s right on budget. We told
you 85 when we first proposed. You
said make it 70 or we get nothing.

Sayers discreetly touches Laz’s arm, a signal that says he
should soften his tone. But Laz continues--

LAZ (CONT'D)
We all knew we’d have to come back
for more. Our plan is still less
than half of what my colleagues at
NASA were proposing.

Deidre shoots a look at Cordine while--

WINTHROP
Our job’s to make sure we’re
spending the taxpayers’ money
responsibly. Your job is to justify
that you are.

CORDINE
Mr. Chairman - if we can get back
to the specific line items, I
believe we can make clear how--

OGELBY
What is this 92 million for
nanotech?

KENT
The FDA approved CRISPR testing on
humans, and we need to fund it.

SCHNEIDER
But is it mission critical?

LAZ
We can’t fully predict the bio-
stressers. Nanotech in the
bloodstream gives us the ability to
monitor and treat in real-time.
17

13.

OGELBY
By messing with genetic code.

LAZ
I'd say improving.

WINTHROP
Playing God.

LAZ
I don’t believe in God, so I’m not
in the business of playing him.

Sayers, Cordine, and Kent stiffen. Ogelby is not pleased with
the response.

SAYERS
We all know God is a she, Laz.

A few chuckles. This eases the tension in the room.

SAYERS (CONT’D)
The best way to see how the money
is being spent is with your own
eyes.

She looks over to Laz with a look that says “step up”.
LAZ
We hope you’1ll join us for the HAB
landing tomorrow.
SAYERS
You can meet our top candidate for
crew commander.

Laz clenches his jaw. Sayers just made a promise he can’t
necessarily deliver.

We hear the whir of a snowmobile engine and CUT TO--

EXT. ALASKA - WOODS - DAY 17

The snowmobile is struggling to make headway through the
quickly deepening snow. It’s beginning to get dark, and with
the storm, visibility is poor.

It lurches to a halt. Hagerty tries to restart the engine,
but it stubbornly coughs, refusing to cooperate.
18

19

14.

TIME CUT to Hagerty inspecting the engine. The husky huddles
close to the snowmobile to get out of the gusts. Hagerty
finds a snapped belt. Pulls it out. Checks his spare parts
bin, but there’s no backup belt to be found.

He unpacks a tent and a shovel from the sled. Starts to dig
out a spot to camp.

INT. D.C. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 18
Laz alone at a secluded table. He’s on his phone.

LAZ
Should I cancel the trip?

INTERCUT WITH--

INT. FAIRBANKS, ALASKA - DINER - NIGHT 19

Blizzard raging outside. Lauren’s in a booth at a greasy
spoon world’s away from the plush restaurant Laz is in.

LAUREN
Tesh says they might need a delay.

LAZ
For how long?

LAUREN
He doesn’t know. They have to work
out a fix first.

LAZ
Maybe it’s better if we put the
breaks on everything. Takes the
rush off you, gives me wiggle room
with the clowns out here.

LAUREN
It didn’t go well?

LAZ
It could've gone better.

LAUREN
What happened?
20

15.

He sees a HOSTESS ushering Senator Sayers toward him.

LAZ
She's walking toward me.

LAUREN
Game face, Laz.

He ends the call. Stands up as Sayers approaches.
SAYERS
(to the Hostess)
Vodka gimlet up.
The Hostess nods and departs. As Laz and Sayers sit--
SAYERS (CONT’D)

Well - I appreciate your honesty,
if not your style.

INT. FAIRBANKS ALASKA - DINER - NIGHT 20

A WAITRESS is setting down a piece of pie with a fresh spoon,
while Lauren's phone is connecting a video call.

We see a five-year old girl - Ellie - on the screen. There’s
something slightly off about Ellie’s look and the fatigue in
her voice, but with the image tight on her face and the
shakiness of the camera, we’re not sure...

LAUREN
Hey sweetheart.

ELLIE
Hi Mommy.

LAUREN
You going to bed soon?

ELLIE
Yeah. Are you?

LAUREN
I’m having some pie first.

Lauren shows her the slice of pie with the phone.
ELLIE
I want some.

DELL (0.S.)
You already had dessert.

ELLIE
But now I want pie.

LAUREN
Daddy's right, it’s time for sleep.
Give me a kiss.

16.

Ellie blows her a kiss. Lauren blows one back. Her husband

DELL (early 40s) comes onto the screen.

DELL
How’s it looking?

She holds the phone to the window to show the blizzard.

DELL (CONT’D)
Don’t push him to go earlier than
he’s comfortable with.

LAUREN
I won't.
DELL
You will.
LAUREN
I won't.
ELLIE (0.S.)

Can I see?

DELL
Show her the snow.

Lauren holds the phone up to the window again. When she looks

back at the phone, Ellie has reappeared.

ELLIE
Did you see Santa Claus yet?

LAUREN
Santa Claus?
21

17.

ELLIE
Daddy says you’re at the North
Pole.

LAUREN

Close to it.

ELLIE
So you'll see him.

LAUREN
Santa Claus doesn’t exist, darling.

Ellie's face contorts. Dell appears back on the screen.

DELL
What are you doing?

LAUREN
We talked about this.

DELL
She’s five.

LAUREN
I’m not going to lie to her.

DELL
We'll call you tomorrow.

LAUREN
Dell...

DELL
She's crying now. I gotta go.

The call ends. Lauren looks at herself in the spoon - an
upside down, distorted image of herself. Allows herself three
seconds of guilt, then buries it.

Sets down the spoon. Picks up her phone. Starts to type
something out. During which we hear HOWLING WIND, which takes
us to--

INT. ALASKA WOODS - HAGERTY’S TENT - NIGHT 21

Hagerty has a SATPHONE linked up to a TABLET DEVICE within
the cramped quarters, his dog taking up half the space
intended for a single human.
22

18.

On the screen, we see that he’s checking the weather
forecast. There’s a large front making its way over northern
Alaska. He tries to zoom in on it but the website is not
responding.

He reorients the antenna on the satphone and holds it up
toward the top of the flapping tent to get a better signal.
It works. Zooms in on his location. It looks pretty bad
weather-wise.

He clicks to a new window. His email. Many of the messages
are Google alerts for the VISTA/NASA Mars Mission. But among
them, he sees an email from Lauren Gutierrez-Holt. The
subject is: SEE YOU SOON

Opens it. It reads:

Since you won’t answer my emails, I’m showing up on your
doorstep. Stuck in Fairbanks, but coming your way. Don’t
shoot at the chopper. LGH

ON Hagerty, brow furrowed in the blue glow of the screen.

INT. D.C. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 22

SAYERS
This level of funding doesn’t
happen without oversight.

LAZ
You can’t outsource and micromanage
at the same time. We promised
faster and cheaper, and you
promised autonomy.

SAYERS
Within reason.

LAZ
Congress is slowing us down.

SAYERS
You won’t speed anything up by
pissing in NASA’s eye at hearings.

LAZ
Their skin in the game is covering
their asses. Mine is getting to
Mars.
SAYERS
Same as my skin.

LAZ
Yours is the construction jobs in
Houston.

SAYERS

If all I wanted was pork, there’s a
helluva lot of easier ways to kill

a pig.

LAZ
I can’t get us there when we’re 15
billion short. I’m spending way too
much time and effort--

SAYERS
Deal with it. There’s no
Michelangelo without the Medicis.

LAZ
The Medicis were smart enough to
buy the paint and get the fuck out
Michelangelo's way.

She starts to cut her last piece of steak in half.

SAYERS
I would never tell you how to build
a rocket. My expertise is
Washington. I’1l get you the money.
But that means rolling out the red
carpet tomorrow.

LAZ
The landing could be delayed.

Off her look--
LAZ (CONT'D)
It’s a technical problem. There's a

valve washer that--

SAYERS
Then you better get me Hagerty.
23

24

20.

EXT. ALASKA WOODS - DAY 23

Hagerty emerges from the tent with the husky. The snow is
deep but falling lightly now. The wind has died down.

TIME CUT to him crouched over a propane stove. He holds both
ends of the snapped belt over the flame, melting the rubber,
then presses them together, fusing them. Holds the fused
portion over the flame once again, pressing the bond together
with his gloved hands. Then pushes the belt into the snow to
solidify the bond.

TIME CUT to Hagerty fitting the belt back into the engine.
The sky is clear now. He hears rotor blades. Looks up through
the tree branches and sees a helicopter dart by overhead.

TIME CUT to Hagerty on the snowmobile, priming the fuel pump
then starting the ignition. The machine sputters to life. He
hops off and inspects the engine. The belt is working. Closes
the cover lid and remounts the snowmobile. It lurches forward
through the deep snow.

EXT. HAGERTY’S CABIN - DAY 24

A couple hours later. As Hagerty emerges from the woods into
a clearing, we see a small cabin ahead - a modest abode that
looks like a collision of the 19th and 21st centuries. The
structure itself could be out of a Jack London novel. But the
roof is covered with solar arrays and a large satellite dish
and antennas. Nearby are half a dozen 30-foot-tall, modern-
looking wind turbines.

A few dozen yards from the cabin is the helicopter we saw
earlier. Lauren is standing beside it in a big parka. She
walks toward Hagerty as the snowmobile comes to a stop.

LAUREN
Thought you might've bailed.

HAGERTY
Got caught in the blizzard.

He retrieves the frozen trout from the snowmobile --

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
Hungry?

LAUREN
I could eat.
25

21.

INT. HAGERTY’S CABIN - MAIN ROOM - DAY 25

TIGHT on the filleted trout frying in a pan. We pull back to
see Hagerty at the stove, Lauren at small table.

The two-room cabin is tidy. Essentials only. But in one
corner is a computer station with several monitors. Top of
the line equipment.

LAUREN
I emailed so many times, I grew
calluses.

HAGERTY

I read all of them.

LAUREN
Why didn’t you answer?

HAGERTY
Didn't know if you were serious or
just testing the waters.

LAUREN
Well I hope me flying to your
doorstep shows how serious we are.

Hagerty plates the fish and brings it to Lauren.

HAGERTY
What about Cordine?

LAUREN
Approved.

HAGERTY
He must've put up a fight.

LAUREN
Laz always wins the important ones.
That’s why I work for him.

HAGERTY
So how does this work?

LAUREN
In person. You fly back with me.

HAGERTY
I’m not a wine and dine guy.
26

22.

LAUREN
The head of the Appropriations
Committee is coming in.

HAGERTY
You need to show me off.

LAUREN
It’s a few handshakes.

HAGERTY
Before I’ve said yes.

LAUREN
I’m an optimist.

HAGERTY
You know what my demand will be.

LAUREN
Laz is prepared to address that.

HAGERTY
Will I get a yes or a or no?

LAUREN
You have to talk to him yourself. I
won’t speak on his behalf.

Hagerty cocks his head with deliberation. Then--

HAGERTY
You eat. I’11l pack.

On Lauren - relief. Hagerty disappears into the bedroom.

INT. HAGERTY’S CABIN - BEDROOM - DAY 26

A fork scrapes across the plate in the other room as Hagerty
packs a duffel with clothing. He takes a couple shirts down
from hangers on a pole which stretches above the single bed.
Among the shirts is a NASA flight jacket. He looks at the
insignia for a moment. Resumes packing.

23.

EXT. HAGERTY’S CABIN - DAY 27

The helicopter rotors swirl to life, kicking up billows of
snow beneath. It lifts off the ground.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 28

Hagerty and Lauren in the back, the husky crammed in too.
Hagerty looks out the window, as the pristine Alaskan
landscape stretches beneath them.

EXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - DAY 29

In stark contrast to the snowy peaks - the arid Santa Monica
mountains. Smoke is billowing upwards from a ridge- line. In
the distance, we see a private plane making a wide turn to
position itself for final approach.

EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - DAY 30

The camera is beneath the fuselage of the plane. We see the
plane’s shadow appear over the runway, get closer, then hear
the squelch of the tires, as they contact the ground with
puffs of burnt rubber.

EXT. VISTA HQ - DAY 31

An Electric Minivan pulls through a security gate at the
entrance of a massive building that stretches for a quarter
of a mile. The VISTA logo in three-story letters along the
side. The van parks in a space next to the entrance. Laz,
Sayers, Cordine, and Winthrop get out. Laz’s ASSISTANT is
waiting. Holds open the door as they enter.

INT. VISTA HQ - HALLWAY - DAY 32

They approach a set of double doors. Above them is a sign
which reads: BUILD FACILITY. Laz holds his phone up to a
scanner. The doors unlock with a click. As Laz opens the
door, we hear the hum of machines, a beeping forklift, metal
against metal, a symphony of construction.

INT. VISTA HQ - BUILD FACILITY - DAY 33

EXTREME WIDE SHOT from above, as the foursome make their way
down a central corridor. The room is vast. One area is
dedicated to satellites. Another to the HAB 3 build. A
prototype section for the Lander/Mars-Ascent Vehicle (LMAV).
An air-lock portion with engineers in sterilized jumpsuits
and hoods doing post-assembly cleaning and stress testing. A
laser cutting and welding section.

And at the far end of the room - dominating an entire side -
the assembly of a massive rocket.

INT. PRETESH’S OFFICE - DAY 34
Pretesh and Min are showing Alvin a copy of the valve--

PRETESH
When we changed the washer from
metal to rubber, we did three shake
and bakes. Two were within the
margin, one wasn’t.

ALVIN
How does a red flag like that--

MIN
You were pushing us on the launch.

PRETESH
(more diplomatic)
Everyone was under pressure. I know
you were too.

ALVIN
Give me odds.

MIN
8 to 1.2 percent catastrophic.

ALVIN
What’s the fix?

PRETESH
We can’t get inside with the arm,
so our focus is entry angle.

MIN
My team’s crunching numbers.
35

25.

ALVIN
(to Pretesh)
Freeze the countdown?

PRETESH
We could use more time.

ALVIN
Alright. I’1l freeze it.
(as he exits)
Get me within the margin.

INT. VISTA HQ - BUILD FACILITY - DAY 35

Sayers and Winthrop are dwarfed by the massive rocket they
are standing near, gazing at it. Laz and Cordine are a few
yards away talking to Alvin.

WINTHROP
When do I get to meet Hagerty?

SAYERS
They're in the air now.

WINTHROP
I want a picture with him. Next to
one of these.

SAYERS
I’m sure we can make that happen.

Laz and Cordine approach them as Alvin walks off.

LAZ
Countdown’s frozen.

WINTHROP
Why?

LAZ
There’s a valve we're taking a look
at. Our engineers are working on
the problem.

WINTHROP
We talking hours, or...

LAZ
Hopefully. Might be days.
26

WINTHROP
(to Sayers)
I’ve got to be back for the
leadership caucus Thursday morning.

LAZ
We'll do our best.

SAYERS
(to Winthrop)
These sort of things are common.

WINTHROP
(to Laz)
Seems serious.

LAZ
Everything’s serious 80 million
miles from earth.

WINTHROP
I'd like to pray.

Winthrop takes Sayers’ hand. He means an actual prayer.
They're all a little taken aback by it.

WINTHROP (CONT’D)
Bob?

Cordine takes Winthrop’s other hand, going with the flow.

WINTHROP (CONT’D)
(to Laz)
I know you’re not a believer...but
if you'll indulge me.

Sayers shoots a look to Laz. Time to play nice. Laz takes
Sayers’ and Cordine’s hands to complete the circle. Winthrop
bows his head and closes his eyes.

WINTHROP (CONT’D)
Dear heavenly father...

Sayers and Cordine follow suit, bowing their heads and
closing their eyes. Laz keeps his open. We start to hear a
deep drone from the baritone sax...

WINTHROP (CONT’D)
Please give your guidance and
blessing to the engineers...

INT. VISTA HQ - PRETESH’S OFFICE - DAY 36

Pretesh, Min, and a team of six other engineers in a heated
discussion. Greg finishes an equation on a dry erase board,
then Min crosses something out, pointing to an entry-angle

diagram--

WINTHROP (V.0.)
...that they might be enlightened
with your infinite wisdom...

INT. VISTA HQ - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 37

Alvin approaches Martha and says something. She speaks into
the headset. We CUT TO to the big screen where we see the
countdown clock FREEZE.

WINTHROP (V.0.)
...that this delay be brief, and we
proceed soon with the mission at
hand...

INT. VISTA HQ - PRESS AREA - DAY 38

Holly is briefing several news camera crews and a dozen
reporters on the delay. One of the reporters asks how long
the delay we be. Holly says she doesn’t know.

WINTHROP (V.0.)
...-So that with the world’s eyes on
us, we can show what gifts you have
endowed us with...

INT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT 39

Hagerty’s POV out the window, a moonless sky filled with
stars above a bank of clouds stretching to the horizon.

WINTHROP (V.0.)
..-And continue on our path into
the magnificent universe you have
created...

INT. VISTA HQ - BUILD FACILITY - DAY 40

WIDE SHOT of the four linking hands from above. Tiny in
relation to the booster rocket. The drone gets louder.

WINTHROP
Amen.

INT. MUSIC STUDIO - DAY 41

A SAXOPHONE PLAYER is playing the baritone sax that we've
heard throughout the episode thus far. Circular breathing.
Cheeks and veins straining, eyes closed, sweat on the brow.
He’s swaying back and forth slowly, as he wills the unbroken
drone into being.

EXT. 249 MILES ABOVE EARTH - DAY TO NIGHT 42

As the drone continues, we see the ISS serenely orbiting
earth, passing from day into night, the sun disappearing
behind the earth.

INT. ISS - NIGHT 43

The drone is replaced with a SWISHING sound.

KAYLA FORD (early 40s, African-American) is floating in micro
gravity looking out the window. Her face lit up by the sun’s
blue reflection on earth.

KAYLA
Hank.

HANK (mid 50s) is working at the other end of the
compartment. He looks over.

HANK
You can see that fire in the Santa
Monica mountains.

He floats over. Looks out the window. Kayla points.

KAYLA
Right there.
44

45

46

29.

HANK
Yeah, I see it.

KAYLA
Big one, huh?

We CUT TO their POV and see the west coast of North America
below, major metropolises, a web of bright lights, Los
Angeles dominating. Just to the north of the city is a string
of glowing fire lines, reddish orange in contrast to the
yellow-white electric light. Fingers of smoke stretch for
twenty miles to the east. As we slowly push in on the tangle
of fire lines and smoke, we hear the sound of a raging a
fire.

EXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 44

Fifty foot flames. Trunks and branches snapping and
crackling. The relentless violence of nature.

EXT. LAZ’S MANSION - NIGHT 45

An electric minivan winds up the driveway of a sprawling
Italian villa. We can see the orange glow of the forest fire
in the far distance behind the mountains.

INT. LAZ'S MANSION - NIGHT 46

DAVID, Laz's butler, shows Hagerty and Lauren into a large
living room. Everything is packed up in boxes. The walls and
floors are bare. Most of the furniture is pushed to one side
of the room along with the boxes and rolled up rugs, except
for one sofa and two chairs placed in the center. A bubble-
wrapped Warhol self-portrait is leaned up against one wall,
upside-down.

Laz is sitting on the sofa. He doesn’t stand when Hagerty and
Lauren enter.

LAZ
Forgive the appearance.

HAGERTY
Moving out or moving in?

LAZ
Out.
30.

HAGERTY
Not the fire...

LAZ
Divorce.

HAGERTY
Been there.

LAZ
(re the chairs)
Please.

Hagerty and Lauren sit in the chairs opposite the sofa.

LAZ (CONT'D)
Why Alaska?

HAGERTY
Where my mother grew up.

LAZ
Back to your roots.

HAGERTY
Something like that.

LAZ
Not because Bob shit-canned you.

Hagerty looks to Lauren. What can she do? Laz is Laz.

LAZ (CONT'D)
He gave me his version. I want
yours.

HAGERTY

NASA’s plan was too convoluted. Too
expensive. They were never going to
get it off the ground. I was vocal.
That rubbed Bob the wrong way.

LAZ
There’s a political element to
bringing you back. You’1l have to
play nice this time.

HAGERTY
Bob must've wanted someone still on
the inside.
31.

LAZ
He did. I don’t. But I need someone
with a NASA pedigree.

HAGERTY
With more allegiance to you.

LAZ
Two birds, one commander.

HAGERTY
You know my ask.

LAZ
I can’t give you final say on the
crew. A lot of people will want to
weigh in.

HAGERTY
They can weigh in all they want,
but this is over two years there
and back. I need to pick the team.

LAZ
I‘1l do everything I can to protect
your choices. But I’m not the sole
sovereign here, as much as I'd like
to be.

HAGERTY
When the terms aren’t clear, it
gets messy. I learned that the hard
way.

LAZ
If you want the command, you’re
going to have to place the same
faith in me as I’m prepared to
place in you.

They hold each other’s gaze, then abruptly--
LAZ (CONT'D)
(to Lauren)

Where are we putting him up?

LAUREN
Four Seasons.
47

32.

LAZ
I hate the Four Seasons.
(to Hagerty)
You can stay in the guest house.

Laz exits without a word, no hand shake. Hagerty and Lauren
are left alone.

HAGERTY
That's it?

LAUREN
Ball's in your court.

Hagerty gets up and walks over to the Warhol painting.

LAUREN (CONT'D)
His wife is a collector. Ex-wife.

Hagerty considers the painting for a moment, then--

HAGERTY
The engineers still at it?

LAUREN
Until there’s a fix.

HAGERTY
I want to stop by.

LAUREN
Is that a yes?

HAGERTY
It’s a maybe.

INT. VISTA HQ - PRETESH’S OFFICE - DAY 47

Hagerty and Lauren with Pretesh, along with Min, Wei, Greg,
and two other engineers. All the engineers look exhausted.
The dry erase board is filled edge to edge with hastily drawn
diagrams and complex equations.

Pretesh holding up a VISTA mug at an angle, using it as a
model for the aeroshell.
33.

PRETESH
We reduce heat back here...
(pointing to the bottom
edge)
But the increase here takes us out
of the margin.

HAGERTY
You could rotate during entry.

Hagerty takes the mug, using it to illustrate.

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
Distribute heat across the rim.

MIN
Problem is, it could twist the
parachute cords.

HAGERTY
Not if you stop rotation just
before deployment.

GREG
We can’t predict how the atmosphere
will affect rotation speed. If we
pre-program incorrectly...

Illustrating with the mug--

HAGERTY
You don’t have to be perfect. The
torque of the parachute will
stabilize even if you have a little
spin. Worked like a gem on Apollo
20. Look...

He goes over to a computer. Pulls up a video. Everyone crowds
around. We see footage of a re-entry taken from a high
altitude drone, an orange glow on a turning capsule.

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
X-axis spin - unplanned. Right here
- I pump the thruster. Manual, so
nowhere close to perfect...still
spinning a little...and here...

We see the chutes deploy, the capsule jerks from the tension,
spins slightly in the other direction then settles, the spin
stopping.
48

34.

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
Boom. A little jerky for a second,
but stable.

MIN
You had more air resistance.

HAGERTY
I’m not an engineer. I’m just going
from experience.

PRETESH
Let’s do the math.

As the engineers get to work, Hagerty turns to Lauren.

HAGERTY
Go get some sleep.

LAUREN
I’m fine.

HAGERTY
Go home. I'll do the sprint. You do
the marathon.

She nods, squeezes his hand, then exits.

INT. LAUREN’S HOME - BEDROOM - DAY 48

Early morning. Dell is asleep in bed. We hear a door open.
Footsteps.

VOICE (0.S.)
Okay little one - here we go.

Dell stirs, squinting at the morning light. Looks over at the
other side of the room.

We see Ellie being lifted by a nanny - INEZ (20s) - froma
medical bed into a high-tech, child-sized wheelchair,
transferring a catheter tube connected to the bed to a socket
on the chair. Ellie has a swollen abdomen and weak limbs. She
has advanced Gaucher’s disease.

Dell sits up.

DELL
Morning Inez.
49

35.

INEZ
Morning.

INT. LAUREN’S HOME - UPSTAIRS - DAY 49 49

Dell - showered and dressed - lightly knocks on a door. He’s
got a mug of coffee in the other hand. Without waiting for a
response, he opens the door to find Lauren in her home
office. The walls are covered with Mars maps and several
large calendars with key mission dates filled in. Lauren is
folding a blanket and placing it on a small sofa where we see
a couple of pillows.

DELL
Again?

LAUREN
I didn’t want to wake her when I
came in.

DELL

(letting it slide)
Inez has breakfast ready.

LAUREN
I’ve got to change and get to the
office.
(re the coffee)
That for me?

He holds out the mug. She takes it, has a sip.

DELL
Can you go in a little late today?

LAUREN
Winthrop’s here, and the countdown
is frozen because--

DELL
She hasn't seen you in two days.

LAUREN
I know, and it kills me, but I--

DELL
Alright, forget it.
50

36.

LAUREN
Don’t punish me.

DELL
Punish you?

LAUREN
For the Santa thing.

DELL
I’m not.

LAUREN
I’ll stay for breakfast.

Dell says nothing. His version of a truce. She sets the
coffee down, gives him a peck on the cheek.

LAUREN (CONT'D)
I love you.

She exits. Dell picks up the mug she left behind.

INT. LAUREN’S HOME - DAY 50

Lauren is feeding Ellie with a spoon. Dell silently eats on
the other side of the table. Inez washes dishes.

ELLIE
Can I try?

LAUREN
Absolutely.

Lauren scoops up a spoonful of Ellie’s oatmeal, then wraps
Ellie’s hand around the spoon. It takes some effort for Ellie
to bring the spoon to her lips, but she does.

LAUREN (CONT’D)
Great.

Lauren wipes the excess oatmeal off of Ellie’s mouth. Takes
the spoon and scoops up some more oatmeal. Places the spoon
back in Ellie’s hand. But this time, she drops the spoon
before it gets to her mouth. Inez, hearing the clatter,
starts to come over.

LAUREN (CONT'D)
It’s alright. I got it.
51

52

37.

Lauren picks up the spoon. Wipes it off with the napkin.
Scoops another spoonful of oatmeal.

ELLIE
Sorry.

LAUREN
Let’s try again.

Places the spoon back in Ellie’s hand. Keeping her hand
wrapped around Ellie’s--

LAUREN (CONT'D)
Here - I’1l help you.

On Dell - who can’t help but be moved by the tenderness
Lauren is exhibiting toward their daughter.

INT. VISTA HQ - PRESS AREA - DAY 51

Winthrop is in the middle of giving an interview to a camera
crew. Holly and Sayers looking on.

WINTHROP
When you’re here, and you see
hundreds of people - the magnitude
of it - I’m convinced that America
will get there before the
Chinese...

As Winthrop continues, we CUT TO Sayers leaning into Holly’s
ear, sotto voce--

SAYERS
You line up as many as you can.
There’s nothing he loves more than

free press. Well, except baby
Jesus.

Holly has to stifle her laugh.

INT. VISTA HQ - BULL-PEN - LAUREN’S CUBICLE - DAY 52
Lauren and Cordine mid-conversation.

CORDINE
What’s the hesitation?
38.

LAUREN
He wants final say on crew.

CORDINE
You see - this is exactly why I
didn’t -

LAUREN

Laz told him no.

CORDINE
The guy’s not a team player. I can
list three other candidates who--

LAUREN
We can’t second guess every
decision like this, Bob.

VOICE (0.S.)
Lauren.

They both look over to see LAUREN’S ASSISTANT nod toward the
central corridor. Laz is approaching. Before he even gets to
Lauren’s cubicle--

LAZ
What’s Pretesh saying?

LAUREN
They're getting there.

CORDINE
We were just discussing Hagerty.

Laz glances at Lauren to get a sense of how the conversation
was going. Not well is the sense he gets.

CORDINE (CONT’D)
There’s no way he gets final say on
crew selection.

LAUREN
I told him you--

CORDINE
And I don’t care if I sound like a
broken record. I still have serious
doubts about--
39.

LAZ
I’ve got a 4-billion-dollar HAB
we're trying to keep from blowing
up. This is the discussion you want
to be--

Cordine calmly, firmly interrupts--

CORDINE
You've been given a great deal of
freedom, but that’s your privilege,
not your right. I can veto. I am
the safeguard. So if I want to
discuss this a third time, and a
fourth and a fifth, that’s what
we'll do.

53 INT. VISTA HQ - PRESS AREA - DAY 53
Winthrop doing another interview.

REPORTER #1
How close are the Chinese?

WINTHROP
They've got Russia and India
helping - a lot of tech and
financial resources. But we’re
about to start crew selection. I
don’t think the Chinese are
anywhere near that stage.

REPORTER #2
Does that mean a crew commander’s
already been chosen?

WINTHROP
I’ve been told it’s probably going
to be Tom Hagerty, which I think
would be an excellent choice.

CUT TO Holly and Sayers, both dumbstruck.

HOLLY
He didn’t...

SAYERS
He did.
54

40.

INT. VISTA HQ - BULL-PEN - LAUREN’S CUBICLE - DAY 54
Laz, Cordine, and Lauren in the thick of it.

LAZ
You wanted a NASA guy. I’m getting
you a NASA guy.

CORDINE
Former NASA.

LAZ
We’re all pros, Bob. You can work
with someone you fired.

CORDINE
He doesn’t respect authority.

LAZ
Because he was right. You were
dragging your asses.

During which Lauren gets a text message.

CORDINE
This is still a NASA venture.

LAZ
It’s a joint venture.

LAUREN
The Congressman just announced
Hagerty.

CORDINE
What...?

LAUREN
On camera.

The two men are stunned for a moment.

LAZ
Well that’s that.

CORDINE
Did you put him up to it?
55

41.

LAZ
I’m a prick, but I’m not a two-
faced prick.

INT. LAZ’S GUEST HOUSE - DAY 55

Hagerty is in the living room watching coverage of Winthrop
on TV. He looks as though he’s barely slept.

WINTHROP (ON TV)
...expect to meet with him today,
and we'll go from there.

Hagerty numb. The coverage CUTS TO a NEWS ANCHOR--

NEWS ANCHOR
Colonel Tom Hagerty commanded two
missions and oversaw the astronaut
training program before leaving
NASA three years ago...

We see footage of Hagerty on a moon walk.

NEWS ANCHOR (CONT’D)
He’s conducted more space flights
than any American, second only to
Sasha Illyich of Russia...

There’s a knock at the door. During the coverage...

HAGERTY
It’s open.

It’s David, the butler.

DAVID
Car’s here for you.

HAGERTY
Let me take Apollo for a quick walk
first.

DAVID

Whenever you’re ready.

As David leaves, Hagerty crouches down and takes Apollo's
face in his hands.
56

57

42.

HAGERTY
Leash or no leash?

Apollo swivels his head free and barks.

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
Alright - no leash.

Hagerty’s cell phone vibrates on the coffee table. He looks
at it, decides to ignore. Turns off the TV instead. Heads to
the door, as the phone continues to vibrate--

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
Come on, boy.

INT. VISTA HQ - HALLWAY/PRETESH’S OFFICE - DAY 56

We FOLLOW Laz, as he briskly makes his way down the hallway
to Pretesh’s office. Opens the door. The camera whirls around
to Pretesh and his team, all turning to look at the boss.

LAZ
Tell me there’s progress.

PRETESH
We may have something.

EXT. BEL AIR STREET - DAY 57

WIDE shot of Hagerty walking slowly along the road - all
gated houses on lush estates. Sprinklers going full force in
one of them. Apollo is trotting along ahead, sniffing here
and there. In the distance we can see the smoke rising from
the Santa Monica mountain fire.

A HUMMER-ESQUE vehicle barrels down the road, blaring music
and whizzing past Hagerty and his dog. Hagerty watches the
vehicle disappear over the crest.

He turns back to Apollo, who scampers around a bend and out
of sight. After a few moments, he hears barking, then
growling. He whistles for Apollo, but the dog does not come
when called.

The barking and growling continue. Hagerty picks up his pace
to a fast walk. As he rounds the bend, he sees Apollo square
off with three COYOTES. They’re smaller than Apollo but have
power in numbers.
58

43.

HAGERTY
Apollo!

But it does no good. The posturing continues. Hagerty walks
closer, tentatively, hoping to scare the coyotes away. He
claps his hands loudly as he yells out--

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
Go on now! Go on!

But this snaps them from defensive to offensive. One of the
coyotes lunges at Apollo. Apollo claws and bites, sending one
of the coyotes darting a few yards away, but just as it
retreats, another one attacks. Apollo has a tougher time with
this one, and, sensing weakness, the first and third coyotes
pounce as well.

Apollo is thrashing about, trying to fend them off, but he
can’t cover all sides at once. The coyotes are snapping at
his legs, going for his throat when they can. Apollo gets
pinned to the ground.

Hagerty acts instinctively. He whips off his pullover and
wraps it around one of his forearms. Heads into the fray.
Uses the padded arm to swipe at the coyotes. One of them
locks onto his covered arm with its jaw. Hagerty swings back
and forth to shake him off. The coyote scampers off. He turns
his attention to the other two, whacking until they roll off
of Apollo and trot away into the brush. Apollo whimpers on
the ground, bloodied by gashes.

EXT. LAZ’S MANSION - DAY 58

Hagerty carries Apollo toward the front gate. It’s no small
feat - the dog weighs well over a hundred pounds. But
adrenalin has kicked in, and his only thought is getting
help. When he gets to the intercom, he presses the call
button with his elbow. A moment later--

DAVID (V.O.)
Mr. Hagerty?

HAGERTY
Bring the car down. Now.
59

60

61

44.

INT. VETERINARIAN’S OFFICE - DAY 59

Apollo squirms as Hagerty and a VET’S ASSISTANT hold him down
on an examination table. The VETERINARIAN gives Apollo a shot
in the hindquarter. Apollo lets out a high- pitched whine.
Hagerty runs a hand along Apollo’s snout.

HAGERTY
It’s okay, buddy. It’s alright.

In a few moments, Apollo slackens from the sedation.
VETERINARIAN
There's a couple deep bites -
here...and here. We’1l have to
stitch those up. I'll want to doa
rabies and tetanus treatment too.

DRIVER (0.S.)
Colonel.

The DRIVER has entered. Holds out a phone.

DRIVER (CONT'D)
Mr. Ingram’s office. Say they’ve
been trying to reach you.

INT. VISTA HQ - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 60

Sayers is introducing Winthrop to Alvin and Martha. Lauren is
on her phone about twenty yeard away, keeping an eye on them.

LAUREN
He’s getting antsy. I need you to
spend some face time with him.

INTERCUT WITH --

INT. VET’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY 61
Hagerty on the Driver’s cell phone.

HAGERTY
When we’re done here.

LAUREN
How long?
62

63

45.

HAGERTY
Could be a while.

LAUREN
I know he jumped the gun. I’m sorry
for that. We’re not trying to
corner you.

HAGERTY
It’s not about him. I won’t leave
my dog. He’1l sense if I’m gone.

LAUREN
Please Tom - do me this favor.

INT. PRETESH’S OFFICE - DAY 62

The office is crammed with people now, including Laz,
Pretesh, Min, Wei, Vivek, Greg, Alvin, the Mission Geologist,
and several Engineers. With a paucity of chairs, most people
are standing. Min is holding up a model of HAB 1, slowly
rotating it.

MIN
All we need is about sixty seconds
of relief on this side, so if we--

Cordine enters. People move aside to make room for him in the
cramped space.

CORDINE
Please. Continue.

INT. VISTA HQ - BUILD FACILITY - DAY 63

Lauren escorts Hagerty toward the large booster rocket, where
Winthrop and Sayers are waiting with a photographer. Winthrop
lights up at seeing Hagerty.

WINTHROP
Colonel, it’s an honor.

As they shake hands--

WINTHROP (CONT’D)
Not everyday I shake hands with a
man who’s been to the moon. Just
wish my son could be here with me.
46

SAYERS
Studying astrophysics at M.I.T.

HAGERTY
Great program.

WINTHROP
Too far from home. And chock full
of liberals. But if you want to
study space, you make sacrifices.

Winthrop laughs. Hagerty forces a smile.

WINTHROP (CONT’D)
I'd like to take a picture, if you
don’t mind - to send to him.

HAGERTY
Of course.

As Hagerty and Winthrop walk toward the rocket--

WINTHROP
Maggie tells me I opened my trap
too soon about you coming on.

HAGERTY
No worries.

WINTHROP
Well, sure as heck hope you say
yes. I don’t want to allocate all
this money to build a ship that
doesn’t have the best skipper.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Right there is great.

Winthrop throws his arm around Hagerty with a big, toothy
smile. Hagerty manages half a smile. Camera flashes.

PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Thank you.

WINTHROP
(to Hagerty)
So tell me - what was it like? The
first time you set foot on the
moon? What was your very first
thought?
64

47.

HAGERTY
Disappointment.

Winthrop’s face falls. Sayers and Lauren stiffen.

WINTHROP
Disappointment...?

HAGERTY
It wasn’t Mars. And it could've
been. If NASA spent its money
right.

SAYERS
I think what the Colonel is trying
to say is--

WINTHROP
Don’t sugar-coat it, Maggie.
(to Hagerty)
It’s refreshing to hear the truth.
Sign of a good leader.

INT. VISTA HQ - PRETESH’S OFFICE - DAY 64

Further into the presentation. Pretesh is pointing to a map
of Mars on the wall. Sundry equations and diagrams populate
the dry erase board.

PRETESH
The new entry angle means we'll
have to put down here - the
Cerberus Plains - either landing
site three or nine.

ALVIN
How’s the soil situation?

GEOLOGIST
It’s not as mineral or water rich,
but it’s flat, open terrain.

LAZ
Is there enough water to test the
fuel generators?
48.

GEOLOGIST
We only got half a meter down so
it’s tough to say. Our estimate is
yes. Barely.

PRETESH
But this puts us close to our
margin on the valve.

LAZ
Just close?

VIVEK
Point zero six.

All eyes on Laz, waiting for his decision. He looks down at
the ground, considering, then back up at Cordine.

LAZ
I'm willing to roll the dice if you
are, Bob.

CORDINE

It’s your call.

LAZ
Our call.

Cordine appreciates the respect given him in front of the
assembled team.

CORDINE
Let’s roll ‘em.

An appreciative nod from Laz. Cordine is stepping up.

LAZ
(to Alvin)
Program the entry, and let’s get to
countdown.
65 INT. VISTA HQ - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 65

Alvin and Martha are at their stations. Lauren, Sayers, and
Winthrop are behind them.

MARTHA
Navigation.
49.

We CUT TO each of the stations as they pipe in.

NAVIGATION
Primary MPS check. Secondary check.

MARTHA
Propulsion.

PROPULSION
Thrusters one through six
operational.

MARTHA

MARTHA
(to Alvin)
Ready to transmit.

ALVIN
(to Winthrop)
Will you do us the honor,
Congressman?

Alvin hands Winthrop his headset. As Winthrop puts it on--

ALVIN (CONT'D)
The command is “Go on landing
sequence.”

WINTHROP
Now?

Alvin nods. Winthrop looks like a kid in a candy store.
66

67

50.

WINTHROP (CONT’D)
(into the headset)
Go on landing sequence.

COMMS (V.0.)
Landing sequence sent.

MARTHA

Countdown is transmission plus

15:52. T-minus 24:17.
We see the COUNTDOWN appear on the big screen.
CUT TO Laz standing in the back of the room, as he was near
the top of the episode. TIGHT on his finger tapping his bicep
with each second that ticks off the countdown clock. He’s
wound up. Abruptly, he makes for the exit.
We STAY with him, FOLLOWING from behind.
A rapid flurry of sax notes starts to bubble up, the slapping

of the valves and circular breathing giving it a percussive
energy.

INT. VISTA HQ - PRESS AREA - CONTINUOUS 66

As Laz passes by the camera crews--

REPOTER #1
Laz...

Without stopping he holds up a hand that says “not now.” We
stay with him as he passes through a set of doors into--
INT. VISTA HQ - BULL-PEN - CONTINUOUS 67

The music continues. A sea of cubicles. Everywhere he walks,
he draws glances - he’s the big boss, after all. The music is
picking up in pace and intensity, an anxious frenetic feel to
it.

He passes through the lobby and main double door into...
68

51.

EXT. VISTA HQ - FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 68

...the BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. Keeps walking through the front
parking lot, away from the building, away from everyone. The
notes are furiously fast now.

There are satellite trucks parked out front now to cover the
landing. Laz heads in the opposite direction.

He stops about 30 yards away from the entrance. And as he
stops, the music abruptly stops too.

We finally COME AROUND on him. He’s got his eyes closed. Lets
the sun shine down on his face. Breathing.

He pulls out his phone. Speed dials. On speaker. A double-
ring, like they have in the U.K.

An ELDERLY WOMAN’S voice answers. It’s a middle class
Yorkshire accent.

ELDERLY WOMAN (V.O.)
Hallo?

Hi mum.

LAZ'S MOTHER (V.O.)
This is a nice surprise.

Her voice is a balm.

LAZ
Sorry to call so late.

LAZ'S MOTHER (V.O.)
Isn't today your big day?

LAZ
Supposed to be. How are you?

LAZ'S MOTHER (V.O.)
Oh fine. Had our final rehearsal
tonight for the Carlisle concert.
Everyone’s nervous, of course.

LAZ
I’m going to have to come see the
choir sometime.
69

52.

LAZ'S MOTHER (V.O.)
You'd rather be caught dead than in
a church.

True.

LAZ'S MOTHER (V.O.)
It’s a nice program. Vitry and
Machaut. Philip gave me one of the
featured sopranos.

LAZ
Let’s have a taste. Over the phone.

LAZ'S MOTHER (V.O.)
(laughs)
I’m embarrassed.

LAZ
It’s just me.

LAZ'S MOTHER (V.O.)
Well...okay, but just a little. I
haven't done my vocal exercises.

She clears her throat, then begins to sing a portion from
Guilliame de Machaut’s “La Messe de Nostre Dame.” Her voice
is tinny through the phone, but soothing and confident. Its
measured melody an antidote to the unsettling saxophone
assault we heard moments before.

Laz sits down on the ground between two cars. Leans his back
against a wheel well. Holds the phone between his knees and
listens, as though it’s a blood transfusion.

As her singing continues, we SMASH CUT TO:

INT. VISTA HQ - RECEPTION - DAY 69

Laz entering the front doors - calm and re-energized. We stay
with him again, but this time from the front, moving
backwards as he moves forward. As he passes through the
double-doors to the main bull-pen, additional voices come in,
filling out the full harmony of Machaut’s piece.
70

71

53.

INT. VISTA HQ - BULL-PEN/PRESS AREA - CONTINUOUS 70
We retrace the same route as before, but TIME CUTTING to leap
through it faster, the music continuing.

INT. VISTA HQ - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 71

Laz makes his way back inside. Assumes his usual place in the
back. Lauren approaches.

LAUREN
You okay?

LAZ
I’m good.

As the music continues we CUT TO a tracking shot of Mission
Control staff waiting anxiously.

CUT TO half a dozen news cameras pointed at the Mission
Control room, one of the cameramen chewing his lip.

Over the P.A. --

MARTHA (0.S.)
Transmission delivery in 5..4..3...

We CUT TO Martha and Alvin at their station.

MARTHA (CONT’D)
2...1...landing sequence initiated.
Countdown to confirmation 9 minutes
14 seconds.

Martha leans back in her chair. Alvin remains forward, elbows
on the table.

ALVIN
Wish the speed of light was about
twenty times faster.

The music continues as we move through a MONTAGE--

-- Winthrop and Sayers in the back. Sayers staring at the big
screen. Winthrop’s head bowed in prayer.

-- Hagerty looking up at the screen, as still as a statue.
54.

-- WIDE SHOT outside the control room, where scores of staff
have gathered to watch on monitors.

-- the empty rocket tube, work lights still inside, but no
technicians there.

-- WIDE SHOT of the long central corridor, devoid of anyone.

-- Exterior of the VISTA Headquarters, the satellite trucks
dwarfed by the massive logo.

-- Two car mechanics working under the hood of a side- swiped
Prius in a rundown auto shop on Lincoln Blvd. Another
mechanic gets their attention to show them live coverage on
his phone.

-- A homeless man pushing a cart down the sidewalk, a
cardboard sign on his back: I HAVE DREAMS TOO.

-- People in business attire waiting in line at a food truck
in downtown L.A. All watching their phones.

-- Third graders in a classroom. All of them watching
coverage on a TV that’s been brought into the room.

-- Directly above the city of Los Angeles, a clover-leaf
highway intersection dominating the center of the frame,
every lane jammed with traffic. Slowly PULLING BACK...

-- The Santa Monica mountains - raw nature in contrast to the
urban sprawl of the city. A wisp of smoke.

-- A burned-out log in a sea of scorched and naked tree
trunks, the remains of the forest fire. A small bird
fluttering onto one of the logs - the only bit of color in
black and ashen landscape.

Then the bird flying off, whipping the camera toward the sky
in a failed attempt to follow it.

-- Taking us to the interior of the ISS - Kayla and Hank
floating as they stare at a computer screen, the same imagery
on the big screen at Mission Control.

We shift focus from them to a small socket wrench floating
behind them, slowly spinning as it inches across the cabin.
Which takes us to--
72

73

55.

EXT. MARS ORBIT - DAY 72

The HAB 1 ENTRY MODULE floats serenely above the curvature of
the red planet below. With several short bursts, the
thrusters angle the bottom of the module toward the surface.
A burst from a side thruster initiates a gentle rotation. A
final sequence of bursts stops the angling and rotation, then
one long burst slows the module down enough to succumb to
Mars’ gravity. It begins a gradual descent. We see the
faintest glimmer of entry burn start to glow on the lip of
the module.

INT. VISTA HQ - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 73

73 Martha and Alvin at their station, both waiting for the
transmission to come through. We can tell from a shift in
body posture that it’s arrived. Alvin looks to Martha.

PROPULSION
Thruster sequence check. Entry
angle confirmed at 23.78 degrees.
Rotation at 1.14 rpm.

INTERCUT between Martha and the following--

MARTHA
Trajectory.

TRAJECTORY
On course check, speed: two one
zero five with uniform decrease
eight nine seven kilometers per
second.

MARTHA
Heat readings.

HEAD OF SYSTEMS
Variable from 650 to 935 Celsius.

CUT TO Pretesh, Vivek, and Min toward the back.

VIVEK
(to Pretesh)
That’s in our zone.

Pretesh holds up both hands, fingers crossed on each.
74

75

56.

EXT. MARS ATMOSPHERE - DAY 74

The HAB 1 module screaming toward the Mars surface, a massive
burn glow enveloping the entire craft, strongest on the
lowest part of the lip angled most toward the ground. But as
the atmospheric resistance slows the module, the burn glow
starts to reduce, finally disappearing altogether. Then
another thruster burst, which slows down the rotation to
almost nothing. As it slows, the MUSIC FADES until it is
gone.

INT. VISTA HQ - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 75

The tension is felt by the stillness of the room, people
barely breathing.

TRAJECTORY
Rotation 0.09 rpm...

Silence as they wait for the next phase. Then--

MARTHA
Chute deployment?

She waits for a response.

MARTHA (CONT’D)
Chute deployment?

A beat, then--

SYSTEMS
Parachute deployed.

A few people clap, but most don’t. One of them is next to the
Head of Systems who whispers--

SYSTEMS (CONT’D)

Not yet.
MARTHA

Eight seconds until secondary

chute.

On Sayers and Winthrop. Then to Pretesh and his team.

VIVEK
(to Pretesh)

(MORE)
76

57.

VIVEK (CONT'D)
If the washer had burned, it
would've affected the primary
chute. I think we’re gonna--

MIN
Shut up. We’re not down til we’re
down.

SYSTEMS

Secondary chute deployed.

We can sense the tension starting to let up in the room.
They’re not home free yet, but they survived the burn phase
and the chute deployment. The two stages everyone was most
worried about.

TRAJECTORY
Speed remains constant.

Not good. Tension ripples back through the room.

MARTHA
Repeat trajectory. You said speed
is constant?

TRAJECTORY
Now it’s increasing. Point eight
terminal velocity. Point nine...

SYSTEMS
Erratic rotation.

PROPULSION
Retro-thrusters have kicked in...

We CUT BACK TO Pretesh, Vivek, and Min.
MIN
Too high.
EXT. MARS - DAY 76

The module is six kilometers above the surface, plummeting
fast.

Its primary and secondary chutes are tangled, causing it to
spin wildly, the tangled chutes unable to slow its descent
and the thrusters doing little to slow descent at this speed,
especially at this height and with the erratic spin.
58.

77 INT. VISTA HQ - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 77

Laz, Cordine, and Pretesh are standing over Martha and
Alvin's shoulders now, staring at their screens.

LAZ
The landing thrusters...

ALVIN
It’s not enough at this speed.

PRETESH

The rotation’s too variable to
counteract.

HEAD OF SYSTEMS
Impact in nine...eight...seven...

Lauren has walked over to Holly now.
LAUREN
Can we get Laz out of his

interviews?

HOLLY
You're killing me.

LAUREN
How is this good press?

SYSTEMS
...three...two...one.

A beat, then Martha, trying not to sound defeated--

MARTHA
Telemetry.

HEAD OF TELEMETRY
We've lost contact.

A wave of disappointment through the room. These people are
all professionals. They’ve seen dozens of launch and landing
failures, but never one as important as this.

On Hagerty, stoic.

CUT TO Sayers and Winthrop. She steals a glance at him. He’s
shaking his head.
78

79

59.

We CUT TO Laz and Pretesh. Pretesh looks devastated but is
trying to keep it together.

PRETESH
It wasn’t the valve. I’m guessing
it was something with the
deployment mechanism.

LAZ
Full diagnostics.

PRETESH
I’m sorry, Laz.

LAZ
We'll land the next one.

Lauren and Cordine approach.

CORDINE
I‘1l do the press, if you'd rather
not.

LAZ

Let’s do it together.

EXT. MARS - DAY 78

From the saxophone, we hear one long, somber note. The camera
glides over the Martian red dust, pristine and untouched,
angled down so the ground fills the frame. As the note begins
to taper off, the camera slows, and we see the gnarled
wreckage of the HAB, smoldering from the crash. The tattered
and scorched parachutes stretching a hundred yards, as though
the module were bleeding cloth.

INT. MUSIC STUDIO 79

TIGHT on the Saxophone player, as the tapering note retreats
into silence. Then he takes a breath, removes the reed and
opens the valves, dumping the built up spit onto the ground.
Over which we hear--

LAZ (0.S.)
We can’t predict everything. That’s
the nature of space exploration...
60.

80 INT. VISTA HQ - OUTSIDE MISSION CONTROL - DAY 80
Laz and Cordine are speaking to a scrum of press.

LAZ
We try, we fail, we try again.

CORRESPONDENT #1
But once you send people, if
there’s a failure...

CORDINE
Will people die? Obviously we want
to prevent that. But it’s possible.

LAZ
It’s not just possible, it’s
probable. Colonizing a new planet
is the biggest challenge humanity
has ever faced.

CORRESPONDENT #2
Even if the cost is human life.

LAZ
We're doing this to perpetuate
human life.

81 EXT. VISTA HQ - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT 81

Laz and Cordine are walking Sayers and Winthrop out the door
to their waiting minivan. They’re mid-conversation.

WINTHROP
Not saying it won’t happen, but
it’s a much tougher sell now.

LAZ
I hope we can count on you.

WINTHROP

The only thing I’ve learned from
politics is never to make promises.

(as he climbs in)
But get Hagerty out East. My people
will be much more amenable to an
American hero than a limey
billionaire.
82

83

84

61.

Being a limey, Laz appreciates the dry humor of this.

INT. VISTA HQ - BUILD FACILITY - NIGHT 82
The HAB 3 unit. Pretesh is there with his team.
PRETESH

Let’s dismantle the entire system.
Lay it out, piece by piece...

INT. LAUREN’S HOME - NIGHT 83
Lauren enters the house, looking exhausted. Makes her way
into the living room, where she sees a CONGRATULATIONS sign
draped above the archway to the dining room, balloons
everywhere. Dell waiting for her in a chair.

DELL
I left it up on purpose.

Off her look--

DELL (CONT’D)
Take this.

He hands her a balloon.

INT. LAZ’S GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 84
Hagerty puts a bowl of water on the ground. Apollo, bandaged
and still a bit out of it, laps up the water. Hagerty runs a
hand through his mane. A knock.

HAGERTY
It’s open.

Laz enters.
LAZ
(seeing Apollo)

How’s he doing?

HAGERTY
A few cuts. He’ll be fine.

Laz steps closer to pet him, but Apollo barks.
62.

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
Doesn’t make friends easily.

LAZ
Was it just the two of you up
north?

HAGERTY

Just the two of us.

LAZ
Your mother’s not from Alaska. She
lived there for less than a year
when your grandad was working the
rigs in Prudhoe.

HAGERTY
Did you check before or after I
lied to you?

LAZ
Before.

HAGERTY
Why didn’t you call me out on it?

LAZ
You don’t embarrass a man you're
trying to convince.

HAGERTY
I haven't said yes yet.

LAZ
Why did you go?

Hagerty just shakes his head.

LAZ (CONT'D)
Forget I asked.

Laz crouches down and lets Apollo sniff his hand. This time,
Apollo doesn’t bark and lets Laz pet him.

HAGERTY
The sky.

Laz looks up.
63.

HAGERTY (CONT’D)
When it’s clear - in the winter -
you can see it all. Twenty-three
hours of night. As cold as space.
If I was never gonna get the chance
again, it was the next best thing.

LAZ
Now you’ve got your chance.

HAGERTY
Still no final say?

LAZ
I can’t promise it any more than
you can promise the crew they’11
survive. But I'll do my best.

The logic is sound, and Hagerty believes him.

HAGERTY
When do I start?

LAZ
You need to settle things up back
home?

HAGERTY
There’s nothing there I can’t leave
behind.

LAZ

Then tomorrow. We’ll fly you out to
D.C. with Bob to rub shoulders.

(points)
The beard.
HAGERTY
I’1l shave.

Without a handshake or farewell, Laz exits.

INT. LAUREN’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT 85

Lauren and Dell enter and turn on the light, Lauren holding a
balloon. Ellie stirs awake. She’s hooked up in her medical
bed.
64.

ELLIE
Hi Mommy.

Lauren pierces one of the balloons with her teeth and sucks
in the helium. With a high-pitched voice--

LAUREN
Hi sweetheart. Mommy’s happy to see
you.

Ellie bursts into laughter at the sound of her mother’s
voice.

ELLIE
Again!

During which, Dell edges out of the room to let them have
some time alone together. With lungs full of more helium--

LAUREN
This is what I sounded like - when
I was your age.

More laughter from Ellie. Then abruptly, matter-of-fact--

ELLIE
Am I going to die?

The question catches Lauren off guard, and yet--

LAUREN
Everybody--

But she still has the helium voice.

LAUREN (CONT'D)
Fuck.

She exhales, letting the helium pass from her lungs. Then,
with a normal voice--

LAUREN (CONT'D)
Everyone dies.

ELLIE
But will I die soon?

Lauren considers for a moment, then - unblinking--
86

65.

LAUREN
You've already lived longer than
you were supposed to. Because
you're strong.

Ellie weighs this, then - straightforward--

ELLIE
Do the funny sound again.

Off Lauren as she sucks in more helium from the balloon.

INT. LAZ'S GUEST HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 86

TIGHT on Hagerty’s face in the shower, hot water streaming
down from crown to chin.

TIME CUT to Hagerty in front of the sink, a circle wiped away
on the steamed mirror so he can see himself. The BUZZ of
clippers as he begins to shave off his beard.

TIGHT on the sink, hair falling into the bowl.

TIME CUT to Hagerty in the bedroom, completely naked, staring
at himself in the full-length mirror. He’s clean shaven now.
His body is not that of a young man’s anymore - its
imperfections amplified by age. But he’s still fit. Strong in
stature, vulnerable in nakedness. Human.

He walks over to a sliding door leading to a terrace, still
naked. Opens it and walks outside, letting the warm, dry
California night air envelop his skin.

Looks over at the burning orange glow from the Santa Monica
Mountains fire in the distance.

His focus shifts to the big house, where he sees Laz on the
patio looking at the glow from the fire as well. Laz turns to
him. Hagerty makes no move hide his nakedness. Laz doesn’t
show any outward reaction to it.

Laz gives him a casual salute, then heads back inside.

Hagerty turns his attention back to the sky, in the opposite
direction of the fire.

From his POV we see a tiny reddish dot in the cloudless night
sky. Mars. You have to strain to see it.
BACK ON Hagerty, staring up at the sky.

HAGERTY
Goddamn.

BLACK OUT.
