Sean Hood - 11/19/10
INT. WOMB - DAY

IN DARKNESS, the solitary sound of a HEARTBEAT, resounding
like a drum over the distant sounds of war, STEEL AGAINST
STEEL, the crack of bootleather on bone.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Between the years when the oceans
drank Atlantis, and the rise of the
sons of Aryas, there was an age
undreamed of...

TILT DOWN to the immaculate crown of an UNBORN BABY, eyes
closed, floating at peace within the warm glow of the womb.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
It was an age of war. And of all
Hyboria, none knew war like the
Cimmerians...

SSSKKTTTCH! A flash of steel as a BLADE PIERCES THE WOMB, not
an inch from the child. As the sword is pulled free we MOVE
WITH IT, out into the MADNESS OF BATTLE.

EXT. CIMMERIA —- BATTLEFIELD - DAY

A VANIR WARRIOR withdraws the stained blade from FIALLA, a
wild-maned Cimmerian warrior-woman, many months pregnant.

From atop a mountain of the dead, CORIN, rallying his
CIMMERIAN WARRIORS against the Vanir, spots Fialla fall.

Corin races across the battlefield, the FOREST ON FIRE around
him, cutting through those in his way.

The battlefield is littered with dead Vanir; by the looks of
it they’ve been fighting over these lands for years.

Fialla clutches her belly, looking up at her attacker, her
other hand reaching through mud for her lost weapon.

Her attacker advances. She DRIVES THE BLADE up into the gap
in his armor. He HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to finish
her off when-

He’s CLEAVED FROM HELMET TO STERNUM, a geyser of blood and
bonechips. Corin draws back his blade and kneels beside his
fallen wife.

Fialla looks down at her bare belly, a visible impression of
the baby against her flesh. She tries to speak, coughing up
blood.
FIALLA
Take your child.

CORIN
Do not speak, love.

FIALLA
You have never been able to still
my tongue, and you will not on this
day.

Fialla grits her bloodstained teeth, drawing a dagger from
her pelt.

FIALLA
I will see my child before I die.

Fialla NEVER takes her eyes off Corin, NEVER screams as Corin
performs the horrific task. The sounds of war fade away, no
more steel, no more screams...

Just the sound of a CHILD CRYING.

Fialla kisses her newborn, his first taste not of mother’s
milk, but of her blood.

FIALLA
See that there will be more to his
life than fire and blood.

No kissing or hugging for these two. Corin and Fialla share a
warrior’s handgrasp, touching forehead to bloody forehead.

CORIN
Name your child...
EXT. CIMMERIA - BURIAL GROUND - NIGHT

The air is wild with burning embers from funeral pyres. Corin
stands with his newborn son.

FIALLA (0.S.)
His name is Conan.

Corin raises YOUNG CONAN skyward against the pyres ablaze. A
baptism by fire.

TITLES: CONAN
EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - CREDIT SEQUENCE - DAY

SMALL BOOTS race through fresh snow. A BOY, 11 sprints
through the village. We don’t see his face, just his scrawny
frame, black unkempt hair hanging in tangles.

The boy cuts through the village center around a large hut,
leaping over a sitting CIMMERIAN ELDER and a ring of GIRLS
crafting a ceremonial drum. The Elder looks scandalized.

No time to apologize. The boy continues his run, weaving
around CIMMERIAN WARRIORS sparring with swords and spears,
ducking under a large SLAIN ELK being prepped for the spit.

The village is preparing for a celebration.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

The boy clears the village, a haven nestled in heavy forests,
surrounded by rolling hills and ashen skies. Ahead...

Corin, older, limping from a war injury, stands before a line
of eager CIMMERIAN BOYS, 12-15. A ring of CIMMERIAN ELDERS
watch this solemn ceremony begin.

As if handing out the Eucharist, Corin walks down the line of
boys, placing in each one’s mouth a small, blue RAVEN’S EGG.
The boys hold the fragile orbs delicately between their lips.

CORIN

When a Cimmerian feels thirst, it
is the thirst for blood. When he
feels cold, it is the cold edge of
steel.

(beat)
But, the courage of a Cimmerian is
tempered. He neither fears death,
nor rushes foolishly to meet it.

(beat)
So, to be a Cimmerian warrior, you
must have cunning and balance as
well as strength and speed.

Suddenly, the boy blunders up and takes a spot at the end of
the line. He struggles to catch his breath.

CORIN
(surprise)
Conan?

ONLY NOW DO WE SEE CONAN’S FACE. At age 11, the boy has a pre-
adolescent scrawniness, lacking the swagger or the size of
the other boys. They eye him dubiously.
CORIN
I gave you chores, boy.

CONAN
Finished, father.

Corin studies his son’s dark intensity, and then he nods
curtly. He places the last egg in Conan’s mouth.

CORIN
The first to circle the hills and
return, the egg unbroken, earns the
right to train with the warriors.
A moment as Corin looks over his son.

CORIN
By Crom, what are you waiting for?

AND OFF THEY RUN, a brutal footrace. They struggle to knock
each other down, to trip each other in the river, to break
the eggs the others carry in their mouths.

EXT. CIMMERIAN FOREST - DAY

They race along a path towards the hill. A TALL BOY kicks
another, whose egg BURSTS as his chin hits the dirt.

Then the Tall Boy swings for Conan’s mouth. Conan ducks,
stumbles, and nearly falls. But the egg remains unbroken.

The bigger boys take the lead, but Conan gains on them by
cutting off the trail, hopping over rocks and logs.
EXT. CIMMERIA - MUDDY FOREST - DAY

Conan takes the lead, with two larger boys right behind him,
all bounding over roots with remarkable balance.

They glide through the harsh wilderness like young wolves,
careful no false step should break their fragile cargo.

But suddenly, around them, there is MOVEMENT IN THE TREES.
Conan spots BARE FEET leaping among the branches, tracking
them. He slows, realizing what this means.

The other boys, even the biggest, stop dead, turn and flee,
rushing back toward the village.

But Conan stands his ground.
WHOOSH! A BOLA ARCS THROUGH THE FOLIAGE. It snags Conan’s
feet, drops him face first into the mud.

Conan tries to stand, tangled in the snare. He wipes mud from
his eyes, finds he’s surrounded by 3 PICT SCOUTS, savages
decorated in tribal warpaint, armed with dual handaxes, the
rotting heads of their enemies slung at their waists.

The Picts make no move, discussing their catch in their
native tongue. Conan watches, mouth held shut, struggling
with the bola, his expression dark and canny.

The PICT LEADER draws a CURVED SKINNING KNIFE, snatches a
fist full of Conan’s hair. He laughs to his fellow scouts.

He doesn’t notice that Conan has slipped free of the Bola, or
that the weighted end is already rising in a wide arc.

CONAN SHATTERS THE LEADER’S SKULL.

With startling speed, Conan grabs the dead Pict’s axe and
with a bloodthirsty shriek, leaps towards the two remaining
warriors...

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

As Corin and the elders wait for the boys to return.

WARRIOR (0.C.)
Corin! Picts on the trail!

The Cimmerian warriors we saw sparring earlier rush up with
all the frightened boys we saw flee from the Pict scouts.

All except Conan.

CORIN
Where?

Corin suddenly turns, and everyone follows his eyes, looking
up the path, but instead of the enemy, they see...

CONAN, COVERED IN BLOOD. He walks past the stunned Cimmerian
boys, past the dumfounded elders, right up to his father.

He clutches the SEVERED HEADS of the slain Picts by their
hair. He SPITS out the broken shell of the egg, and speaks.

CONAN
I am ready to fight.

Corin studies the boy, gravely. All stand in awe. Then Corin
nods to the warriors who rush out onto the trail.
CORIN
Search the hills.

INT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - CORIN’S FORGE - NIGHT

Corin enters and watches his boy wave a short sword through
the air, lost in fantasies of battle. Corin looks troubled.

Corin reaches out and grasps the hilt, trying to take the
weapon away. For a moment the outraged boy won’t let go. But
it only lasts a moment. Coming to his senses, Conan
relinquishes the blade and goes back to work.

CORIN
Remember that you fight not just
for yourself. There are secrets
hidden here that have the power to
change the course of history, and
someday they will be your
responsibility to protect.

Corin opens a WELL HIDDEN DOOR IN THE FLOOR and places the
sword back in a cache of weapons, armor and sacred objects.

Conan works the bellows of a complex forge, the walls adorned
with ARMS AND ARMOR. He looks bored and impatient, staring
into the fire, FLAMES REFLECTED IN HIS EYES.

CORIN
Come. It’s time you learned to
forge a blade.

Corin leads Conan to their anvil, offers Conan the master
smithing hammer. Conan doesn’t take it.

CONAN
Crom made me to wield swords, not
to hammer them.

CORIN
Crom has shaped you, as he shapes
us all, to his own cold ends.

INT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - VARIOUS - SMITHING MONTAGE

Over the course of many weeks, Corin teaches Conan the art of
blacksmithing. Days and nights pass as,

- Ore is carted in from the hills, BACK-BREAKING WORK.

- Bellows ROAR as the ore is superheated to liquid metal,
poured into a mold from an ELABORATE PULLEY SYSTEM.
- The FORGING of the blade, hot iron poured into a mold.
- Corin EXAMINES CONAN’S SWORD. Conan is proud of his work.
CORIN
What is most important when forging
a blade, fire or ice?
CONAN
(obviously)
Fire.

Corin stares. Silence. Conan senses he’s made a mistake.

CONAN
Ice?

Corin continues to stare. Conan looks baffled.

CORIN
Are you certain?

Conan nods, uncertain.

Corin sighs, shakes his head, and then STRIKES the anvil with
the sword. THE BLADE SHATTERS. Conan stares at his own
reflection caught in the shards of broken metal.

CORIN
Let’s begin again.

- RELENTLESS HAMMER WORK, Corin and Conan pound the metal
together, backlit by the forge. Sparks fly.

CORIN (0.S.)
This sword we make will be yours
one day. But before you wield it,
you must understand it.

- The blade is HEATED until it glows.

CORIN
A sword must bend or it will break.

- The blade is QUENCHED. Steam rises from the cooling tub.

CORIN (0.S.)
It must be tempered...

- Conan watches Corin etch the pommel of the CIMMERIAN
GREATSWORD. A work of art.
CORIN
Fire and ice. Together. This is the
mystery of steel.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - FROZEN RIVER - DAY

Conan and Corin spar atop an ice sheet over a shallow river.
For his age, Conan is quite the warrior, and he shows it.

But, his father, the master warrior, wielding the new
greatsword, easily deflects his every blow. It’s like nothing
Conan has ever faced before.

CORIN
You are STILL all fire, boy.

Frustrated, Conan just swings harder, struggling for balance
as his feet slip and slide on the ice.

CORIN
No. Slow down. Find your footing.

Corin sidesteps a clumsy thrust, knocks Conan off his feet,
spreading cracks across the ice.

CORIN
(shaking his head)
Enough.

But Conan isn’t finished. What he lacks in skill he delivers
in ferocity, slashing and charging. But, with two flowing
strokes Corin knocks the boy back.

CORIN
ENOUGH.

Corin PLUNGES HIS GREATSWORD into the cracked ice sheet, like
Arthur returning the sword to the stone.

In an explosion of sudden anger and frustration, Conan
CHARGES HIS FATHER with his sword. Corin calmly pulls back
his blade stuck in the ice sheet.

Corin’s blade works like a lever, cracking the ice further.
And just as Conan reaches him.

CRACK! The ice splits. Conan DROPS INTO THE SHALLOW RIVER.

Corin glares. Conan pulls himself out of the frigid water to
see his father sheathing the blade he wants so badly.
CORIN
(with disappointment)
You are not ready for this sword.
Humiliated, Conan turns and bolts towards the hills.
Corin watches him go, then walks somberly to the village.
However, as the wind picks up, he sniffs as if sensing
something in the air. Perhaps a coming storm.

EXT. CIMMERIA - HILLTOP - DAY

Conan, hair still soaked, races past snow covered pines,
slashing limbs, causing a rain of shattered ice crystals.

Conan sits at the hilltop looking out over the slopes and
sombre hills of Cimmeria.

A long beat as he broods. A sudden gust of icy wind.

Conan senses something. He listens. Something in the distance
CRACKS like a whip, and panicked birds race across the sky.

Far below, he sees a line of DARK RIDERS galloping ominously
towards the tiny village. A rumble like thunder.

Then, from the south, a swarm of lighted arrows rise brightly
against the ashen sky, arc slowly and fall on the thatched
rooftops, setting them aflame.

Conan gawks, stunned. And then he RUNS...

EXT. CIMMERIA - MUDDY FORREST - DAY

As Conan races home, MOUNTED TURANIANS, scouts for the
invading army, ride towards him, hooves kicking up powder.

He ducks into the cover of the forest. The riders spur on
their horses and pass by. Conan stays low, taking his
shortcut through the wilderness.

EXT. CIMMERIA - WILDERNESS - DAY

Conan bushwhacks his way back to the village. As he gets
closer, the forest darkens, thick with BLACK SMOKE.

He slides down a snowbank, racing across the small river
running from his village, waist deep before he realizes...

THE RIVER RUNS RED WITH BLOOD.
10

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Conan bursts through the treeline out into an open field.
Ahead, his village is in flames. Cimmerian warriors, both men
and women form defensive lines. And behind him...

AQUILONIAN BRIGADES COME CHARGING - bandit knights who fight
with polished shields and short swords. Conan’s shortcut has
placed him smack in the middle of the invasion.

He sprints for the village as the mounted riders converge all
around him. Conan swerves to avoid being trampled. On foot,
these men would be twice his size. On horseback, they’re
armored juggernauts towering over him.

And then, he sees the most terrible sight of all.

A RIDER EMERGES FROM A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE, an angel of
death wearing green leather armor and bearing a shield marked
with the ACHERONIAN SEAL.

This is the brigand-leader KHALAR ZYM.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - CORIN’S FORGE - DAY

Leading a band of strong Cimmerian warriors, Corin drives the
first wave of Aquilonians back. The old master swordsman
takes down two attackers himself.

But more and MORE keep coming.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY

As Conan enters the village, he sees FOUR tribes assault his
people from different directions.

KUSH SPEARMEN, muscled warriors wearing the bones of
slaughtered victims, assault the Cimmerians from the flank.

TURANIAN raiders swarm the opposite flank.

The AQUILONIAN knights have crossed the moat, pushing the
defending Cimmerians back.

BRYTHUNIAN ARCHERS, amazons augmented for ranged combat,
pepper the village with arrows. THUNK! THUNK! THUNK! The
arrows stick into Cimmerian shields.

Conan keeps running.
11

As the boy passes an unsuspecting Aquilonian, he grabs the
warrior, spins him into the path of the arrows. The
Aquilonian gets skewered, Conan snatches his shortsword.
SLAM! Conan is knocked down by a Kush warrior. Conan spins to
avoid a spear attack, driving his blade into the warrior’s
gut. The spearman crumbles.

And Conan springs back to his feet.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - NEAR THE FORGE - CONTINUOUS

The air thick with smoke, the snow rich with blood. So many
Cimmerians have fallen. It’s a massacre.

And still the invaders come, unmerciful and relentless.

Conan sprints to the forge, one of the few buildings not
burning, but the open door reveals it is full of enemies.

Looking through the cracks between wall boards, Conan sees
his father surrounded by the leaders of each enemy tribe.
INT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - CORIN’S FORGE - CONAN’S POV - DAY

It’s difficult to hear what is being said. One by one, Conan
scans the faces of each tribal leader.

AKHOUN, a Turanian, four hundred pounds of corpulent flesh,
not so much armored as wrapped in chain.

CHERIN, the Brythunian, looks statuesque and imposing.
LUCIUS, the Aquilonian leader, corpulent and vain, who rolls
and cracks his neck in a distinctive manner. He holds the
leash of a growling wolfhound.

UKAFA, a Kush chieftain wielding an enormous mace lined with
sharpened bones and rusted metal.

REMO, a crippled hunchback, and with him an acolyte baring
the invaders’ standard, a death mask made of shards of bone.

 

And lastly, Khalar Zym himself, an exiled prince from the
lands of Nemedia; Khalar may look like a brigand, but he
speaks as eloquently as a prince.

KHALAR ZYM
There is no shame in kneeling
before me. All these fighters have
surrendered, left their lands and
sworn their allegiance to me.
(MORE)
12

KHALAR ZYM (CONT'D)
(beat)
They’ve done so because they know I
will one day be a god.

Corin stares calmly in Khalar’s face, but Conan sees, as
Corin turns, that his father’s shoulder has been pierced with
an arrow, and his back is wet with blood.

CORIN
One day, the other clans of
Cimmeria will gather for vengeance.
Then, god or not, you shall fall.

Khalar rolls his eyes. He hears this all the time. Then he
indicates the strange mask of bone.

KHALAR ZYM
There is one piece missing from
this mask. Give it to me now... or

die, and I'll find it myself.
Corin just smiles defiantly.

CORIN
I prefer death.

Lucius steps up, raises his short sword to behead him.

And then, CONAN BURSTS IN like a wild animal.

WHOOSH! A blade SLASHES LUCIUS’ NOSE CLEAR OFF. He tumbles
backward, grabbing for his severed nose, failing to snatch it
before the wolfhound DEVOURS IT.

Then Conan POUNCES, blade thrust at Khalar.

But Khalar is too fast. He deflects the blade, though the
strike carries such ferocity that Khalar is knocked back, the

sword grazing his ear, DRAWING BLOOD.

Ukafa and Remo seize Conan. Corin lunges to defend his son
but he is clubbed down by Akhoun.

Khalar catches his own blood in his palm, shocked, but
IMPRESSED. He smiles.

KHALAR ZYM
Is that your son? I LIKE HIM.

MINUTES LATER

Akhoun binds Corin to the forge, a fiery vat of molten steel
suspended precariously above him.
13

Khalar pokes a support chain and the vat wobbles. A tiny glob
of molten metal spills from the brim and falls on Corin’s
shoulder, burning and bubbling through his flesh like acid.

But the gritty Cimmerian does NOT cry out in pain.

KHALAR ZYM
Such a waste. Think of the power I
could have shared with you.

CORIN
Cimmerians have no use for sorcery.

Conan is pinned to the floor by the strong chieftain, Ukafa.
Lucius presses blood soaked rags to his ruined face.

Remo and Cherin ransack the forge, turning it inside out.

REMO
The bone shard is not here.

KHALAR ZYM
You just don’t know how to look.

Stepping eerily from the shadows where she had been lurking
all along, is Khalar’s daughter, MARIQUE, 13.

Her face is uncanny; with no eyebrows and a hairline high
above her forehead, she looks both regal and serpentine.

KHALAR ZYM
Your son has courage, but my
daughter has talents as well.
(beat)
Where is it, Marique?

Khalar’s lieutenants are clearly unnerved by the little girl.
She dangles her long fingers along the ransacked arms and
armor, as if she had some sixth sense in her fingertips.

KHALAR ZYM
The Cimmerians do not pray. They
have no priests or preachers.

Closing her eyes she SNIFFS, as if catching an intriguing
scent, and she feels along the walls like a blind girl
exploring the face of a lover.

KHALAR ZYM
This is what matters to them. This
is their church. It will be here...

Her witch-eye flashing magically, Marique discovers the
hidden door in the floor. She opens it.
14

Conan sees his father clench his teeth and wince. The boy
tries to squirm out of Ukafa’s grip but is held fast.

Marique’s spidery fingers probe the weapons in the secret
cache. She gasps suddenly and smiles.

From the cache, she pulls out a LUMP OF ORE, brings it close
to her face to sniff it and to probe it with her tongue.

Then she crosses the forge and places the ore in the furnace.

All watch as the ore heats and rapidly loses its shape. A
SHARD OF BONE rises to the surface.

The girl reaches in, and with two budding black nails,
pointed as needles, she picks out BONE FRAGMENT. Sharp as sin
and white as death, it mysteriously cools before their eyes.

KHALAR ZYM
Your mother would be proud.

The men stand back in deference as she crosses and hands over
the shard to her father.

Khalar looks at it with a kind of religious awe. His eyes
water. His hands actually tremble as he grasps it.

But then he steels himself.

KHALAR ZYM
Gather the men. Burn everything.

Lucius moves to impale Conan.

KHALAR ZYM
Wait. Not him. Not yet.

LUCIUS
Not yet? HE CUT OFF MY NOSE!

Khalar’s other henchmen toss torches against the far walls.
The forge catches aflame. Khalar locks eyes with Corin.

KHALAR ZYM
How do I punish you Cimmerian? You
fear not death, nor pain, nor
insult to honor.

Marique whispers in her father’s ear, making him smile.

Khalar hacks at a support chain. The vat of SUPERHEATED METAL
begins to tip toward Corin.
15

Conan SNATCHES the stabilizing chain, grimacing as the links,
heated from the fire, SIZZLES into the flesh of his palms.

KHALAR ZYM
Something worse than death. Watch
your son die because he loves you.

Khalar exits, his men follow. Marique, the last to go.

She lingers at Corin’s greatsword, awed by the craftsmanship.
She runs her finger perversely over the edge, slicing her
fingertip. The sting seems to please her.

Smiling sadistically, she steals the blade and goes. Conan is
incensed, but helpless: if he lets go of the chain, his
father will die in a shower of molten metal.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - CORIN’S FORGE - DAY

Flames sweep over the walls and rooftop, swiftly becoming a
raging inferno.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY

Khalar Zym stands, surrounded by his victorious army, and he
is joined by his daughter.

Remo hands him the MASK OF ACHERON, a jigsaw puzzle of many
bone fragments, arranged in a white mask of death.

With bated breath, Khalar inserts the recovered shard into
the mask. It fits perfectly. The mask is complete.

Khalar RAISES THE MASK OF ACHERON. His mercenary army CHEERS.

KHALAR ZYM
We are halfway there, Marique. Now
we must find the pureblood, and
then, your mother will return.

INT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - CORIN’S FORGE - DAY

Conan struggles to keep the vat of molten ore from tipping.
If he lets go, his father dies. If he doesn’t let go, the
SPREADING FLAMES will kill them both.

CORIN
Conan, you cannot save me.
16

Conan struggles with the chain, his hands smoldering. A
droplet of molten steel falls from the vat, searing his cheek
but he does not loosen his grip.

CORIN
Let go of the chain, boy.

Conan’s losing ground, his heels sliding through the dirt. He
won't look Corin in the eye.

CONAN
I’m not afraid to die.

CORIN
Nor I. But, I watched your mother
die so you could live.

But Conan will not let go. He will never let go. And Corin
knows this, watching the fire spread around them, blistering
the skin of Conan’s back.

CORIN
Conan... LOOK AT ME.

The boy looks in his father’s eyes.

CORIN
She wanted more for you, in this
life, than fire and blood.
(beat)
I love you, son.

Corin uses the last of his strength to pull the chain from
Conan’s hands. The vat of ore spills down, a TORRENT OF METAL
ENVELOPING CONAN’S FATHER.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - FORGE - DAY

Conan crawls from the runoff through the snow toward the
frozen river. He plunges his hands into the water.

As he pulls his hands free, he looks at his palms. The chain
has been branded into his flesh.

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY

Conan stumbles back into the village. The bodies of everyone
he knew, litter the ground. In a grim echo of the scene of

his birth, all the buildings are aflame.

His blue eyes are wide with the shock of innocence lost.
17

Looking down, he sees a Cimmerian sword sunk, point first,
into the snow. He grabs the hilt and drags it like a stick.

The boy walks on, in shock, and a lingering Turanian Raider
looting a corpse, looks up and sees him approaching.

Sensing an easy kill, the Turanian springs towards the boy,
but Conan snaps out of his trance and CUTS HIM DOWN.

Then the boy runs wildly forward, HOWLING WITH RAGE. With his
wiry, adolescent arm, he RAISES THE BLADE IN THE AIR.

MATCH CUT TO:

EXT. ZINGARAN COASTLINE - DAY

The SAME SWORD RAISED HIGH IN THE AIR, but the arm that holds
it is massive, muscled, and scarred.

CONAN, the fully grown icon we all recognize, CHARGES down a
hill on horseback, leading a crew of Zingaran pirates.

ARTUS, a dashing captain of Zingaran pirates, rides alongside
him, unleashing a lusty battle cry.

Around them a dozen BOULDERS roll downhill like tumbleweeds.
It's a wild frenzy of energy, motion and aggression.

DOWN BELOW

A SLAVE CARAVAN rolls across broken earth. SLAVEGIRLS, naked
save for their loincloths and the chains that bind them, sit
packed in caged wagons, sheltered from the midday sun.

The MALE SLAVES walk alongside the wagon, their feet
blistered, skin blacked, and flesh lean from hard labor.

A rumble like an earthquake. The HEAD SLAVER looks up,
confused as the ground itself seems to be HURLING TOWARD HIM-

BOOM! A boulder CRUSHES the slaver, crashing into the
caravan, sending the horses into a frenzy, spilling loot
across the road. BOOM! BOOM! More boulders tear through
wagons and shatter carts of food.

Then the Zingaran pirates swarm, waving their steel.

Most of the slavers take one look at their attackers and
FLEE, abandoning their caravan. Artus howls with laughter.

ARTUS
Come back and fight! You pink-
bellied, stub-cocked, goat lovers!
18

Conan gallops alongside a caged wagon, past spellbound slave
girls gaping at the sight of him. He swats a slaver off his
mount sending him head first into the sand.

The Zingaran pirates ride in circles, whooping, screaming,
and beating their chests. The few remaining slavers give up,
and ride away in panic and terror...

«+. all except one. The largest slaver, THE WILD MAN, his
simian arms, hairy back, ratty beard and blackened teeth.

With a ferocious shriek, the Wild Man CHARGES AT CONAN AND
ARTUS. The two men study him curiously as he gallops.

ARTUS
Are you going to take this one?

CONAN
No, you go ahead.

The Wild Man rides closer, raising his deadly spear.

ARTUS
I had the troglodyte last week.

CONAN
Are you sure?

ARTUS
I insist.

At the last possible second, Conan calmly ducks a frenzied
spear thrust to his face, and lops off the slaver’s head.

As the decapitated body rides on, the severed head twirls in
the air like a soccer ball and lands in the sand. THUNK!

Conan scowls at his sword. Artus mimes his swing.

ARTUS
I think you pulled left.

CONAN
(shaking his head)
The blade is warped.

Both pirates and slaves erupt in cheers.

INT. ZINGARAN COASTLINE - LATER

Artus and his pirates loot the caravan of anything and
everything of value and load it onto rafts and rowboats.
Anchored at bay is their pirate ship, THE HORNET.
19

Conan cuts the slaves free.

CONAN
Go. You are all free.

The slaves look frightened and bewildered. TWO BUXOM SLAVE
GIRLS steps forward.

SLAVE GIRL #1
But... But you have taken all the
food, all the weapons.
(beat)
Where would you have us go?

It’s wilderness and unbroken coast in every direction.

Conan looks over the slaves. He’s right; no food, no weapons,
the men wear loincloths, the women wear even less.

CONAN
You are right...
(thinking)
The women will come with us.

INT. MESSANTIA - ALEHOUSE - NIGHT

SLAVE GIRLS GONE WILD. They dangle from hanging lanterns,
dance on table tops, and pour ale into mugs for the randy
pirate crew. The air is thick with smoke.

Two women, painted and naked, writhe on Artus’s lap. One is a
waif, petite and pert, who feeds him dates.

KEERRRACK! A portly GOON’S wrist breaks as Artus beats him in
an arm wrestling match. The pirates jeer at the Goon’s
dangling arm as he stumbles away from the table.

Conan arrives, mugs of ale in hand, and laughing in mock-
challenge, takes the Goon’s place.

Now Artus and Conan arm wrestle, and the two muscled hulks
battle to a tie. Slave girls and pirates cheer them on.

Then Conan cheats, hurling ale in Artus’s face, and as his
friend flinches, Conan drives his arm to the table.

Conan laughs in triumph, until Artus SLUGS HIM IN THE FACE.
Artus ROARS with laughter as his friend shakes off the blow.

CONAN
I still win.
20

SLAVE GIRL #1 chugs her ale, the foam gushing over her chin
and dribbling off her breasts, where Conan happily laps it
up. Another SLAVE GIRL # 2 runs her fingers admiringly over
his MUSCLES.

SLAVE GIRL #2
You are as strong as Crom himself!

Artus stands from the table and speaks to all...

ARTUS
When I first met him, he was no
bigger than you. Just a scrawny
little rat picking pockets in
Zamora.

SLAVE GIRL #2
(slinking into Conan)
Is it true?

The girls listen in rapt attention, and SLAVE GIRL writhes
like a showgirl.

ARTUS
But even so, it was he who stole
The Elephant’s Heart and slew the
sorcerer Yara.

The girls SQUEAL in delighted disbelief.
SLAVE GIRL #2
(impressed)
That was YOU?

CONAN
Who’s next?!

There are no takers for the empty seat across from Conan.
Suddenly an wily thief, ELA SHAN, ducks into the alehouse,
glancing over his shoulder as if pursued. This rogue in an
eye patch tries to lose himself in the raucous crowd.

Seeing only one empty seat, Ela Shan cuts through the
drinking and fornication, and sits across from Conan.

Conan drops his elbow to the table, hand open, offering the
challenge. The skeptical crowd reacts with wild laughter.

ELA SHAN swallows, hides his face and puts his own arm on the
table, accepting the match with trepidation.

As the arm wrestling begins, Conan hams it up for the crowd,
grunting and huffing as if his opponent were Hercules.
21

Conan allows Ela to push his arm closer and closer to the
table, but then using only his index finger, he pushes back
to center. The slave girls root and cheer!

The anxious thief looks to the entrance and sees...

The CITY GUARD, THREE heavyweights in armor, scan the crowd.
The Captain of the Guard, a corpulent man in a strange mask
that covers his nose, points directly at the thief.

Conan squints through haze at the Captain, catching only
glimpses through the mob. He’s familiar: The distinctive way
he rolls his neck. The mask that covers his nose.

But after dispatching his men, the Captain of the Guard steps
into a waiting chariot and is gone.

Conan’s face goes dark - the same grim intensity we saw in
the boy. Could it be the same man?

Conan looks down at the MANACLES clamped to Ela Shan’s
wrists. Conan smiles, grips the thief harder, even as Ela
tries to pry free and run.
The guards get closer and closer.
ELA SHAN

They’1l be happy to take us both to

prison, if you don’t let go!
Conan smiles and nods. Just as the surly Guards reach them...

CRUNCH! Conan slams his head back, breaking Guard #1'’s nose,
sending him stumbling backwards.

The crowd is shocked. Artus looks up in confusion.

Conan BURSTS UP FROM THE TABLE as Guard #2 charges. Conan
lifts up a wooden bench and slams it across Guard #2's face,
sending him reeling.

Guard #3 points the tip his sword at Conan. Guards #1 and #2
draw swords too. Conan just raises his hands in surrender.

Artus shoots Conan a look: what the hell are you doing?

Conan shakes his head: don’t interfere. Artus raises an arm to
keep any of the pirates from stepping in.

Guard #1 nabs Ela Shan as he tries to slip away unnoticed.
Conan allows himself to be cuffed.
22

EXT. PRISON - QUARRY - DAY
Emaciated INMATES, many shackled together, work in a small
quarry. They turn to watch the City Guards enter, leading a
shackled Conan and Ela Shan into the yard.
Ela looks at Conan, who seems relaxed and determined.
ELA SHAN

Never have I seen one so calm as he

is led to the gallows.
INT. PRISON - GUARD ROOM - NIGHT

In a chamber filled with instruments of torture, a prisoner,
skeletal and suffering, sits chained to the wall.

By stark contrast, the BAILIFF sits at a table, calmly eating
a “civilized” dinner of wine and pheasant.

The Bailiff throws a bone at the feet of the prisoner, and
giggles as the starving man grasps for it, just out of reach.

Conan, still shackled, stands before the Bailiff.

CONAN
Where is the captain?

BAILIFF
Aha, so the hill ape can speak. The
captain is currently... occupied.

From down a corridor, we hear SCREAMS OF PAIN. The Bailiff
cackles impishly.

BAILIFF
But don’t worry. Everyone gets
their chance.

The Bailiff tries to taunt the barbarian by dangling a
pheasant drumbstick just out of reach. It’s a mistake.

Conan twists his bound hands around the Bailiff's arm. He
twists the chains hard, breaking bone.

Then delivers a PRIMAL HEADBUTT, knocking the Bailiff to the
ground. Conan places his boot to the Bailiff’s throat.

CONAN
Where is the Captain of the Guard?
23

BAILIFF
His door is sealed from within, and
he will only open it for me!

INT. PRISON - CAPTAIN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

The CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD sits before a table of knives and
hooks. He works a nasty set of CLAMPS onto Ela Shan’s wrists.
A FAT GUARD watches, vaguely bored.

Then comes a HEAVY KNOCK at the door.

FAT GUARD
Yes?

Another knock. The guard, frustrated, retrieves his keys,
sliding open a small EYEHOLE.

The Bailiff stares back at him.

The Guard opens the door, finds Conan holding the Bailiff’s
head. The Guard barely has time to blink before Conan GUTS
HIM. The Captain turns around, the mask hiding his face.

But there’s no mistaking him now. It’s Lucius, the disfigured
Aquilonian Conan last met as a boy.

Lucius reaches for his blade. Conan is faster, grabbing it,
DRIVING IT THROUGH LUCIUS’S FOOT into the wood floor below,
pinning him in place.

LUCIUS
GUARDS!

INT. PRISON - AREA OUTSIDE CAPTAIN’S CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

FIVE ARMED GUARDS rush in, weapons drawn. Conan doesn’t
hesitate. He flings the table through the threshold, sending
knives and hooks into Armed Guard #1.

Armed Guard #2 leaps over the table. Conan grabs him midair
and slams him down onto the blades. Ela Shan watches in awe.

The other guards rush forward at once. Conan slams Guard #3
face down into a COAL FIREPOT. Then, Conan spins and severs
Guard #4’s arm at the elbow.

Finally, Guard #5 pins Conan to the wall, choking him with
the shaft of his poleaxe. Conan struggles for breath, turning
a deep shade of purple.
24

Conan reaches for his blade. He doesn’t need it. The soldier
drops, stabbed from behind by Ela Shan.

Conan catches his breath, steadies himself with the wall.

ELA SHAN
NORTHERNER, BEHIND YOU.

Conan spins just in time to block Lucius’ dagger attack. He
lifts Lucius off the ground by his throat.

CONAN
You remember me?

LUCIUS
What? Who are you?

CONAN

The one who gave you your pretty

face.
Conan rips off Lucius’ prosthetic, revealing his disfigured
face, a GAPING BLACK HOLE where his nose used to be. And now
Lucius does remember, eyes growing wide with horror.
Conan grabs Lucius by the empty cavity and pulls him over to
the torture rig.

INT. PRISON - CAPTAIN'S CELLS - LATER

Ela Shan tightens the clamps on Lucius. He shrieks. His
prosthetic mask hangs awkwardly on his beaten face.

A flag with the Seal of Acheron hangs on the wall.

CONAN
Where is the man who killed my
father?

LUCIUS

You seek Khalar Zym?

CONAN
Zym? No. My people were slain by a
common bandit, not a king.

LUCIUS
He was a bandit then, but now, a
legend - a shadow lord, nowhere to
be found, yet everywhere at once.

Unimpressed, Conan picks up an executioner’s axe.
25

CONAN
Well, then, I have no use for you.

LUCIUS
Wait. WAIT. I can help. I’1l tell
you what I know. Just give your
word, give me your word you won't
kill me.

Conan thinks about this. A moment, then he SLAMS DOWN THE
AXE, nearly cutting off Lucius’s hand.

CONAN
Speak. I won’t kill you.

LUCIUS
You know of the Turanian deserts,
and the forbidden forest?

CONAN
Nothing there but dead men and the
animals who pick their bones.

LUCIUS
And yet Khalar leads his legions
through the waste as we speak.

CONAN
Not good enough.

Raising the axe again.

LUCIUS
Wait please. The waste is large,
yes, but when he returns to his
stronghold at Khor Kalba, it will
be by way of the Shahpur ravine.

Conan looks to the thief.

ELA SHAN
That’s a fine place for an ambush.

CONAN
What does he want in the Red Waste?

LUCIIUS
He and his witch daughter are
searching for a girl.

CONAN
Searching the wasteland for a
woman? Are you sending me into a
trap?
26

LUCIUS
No! I have no reason to lie. He’s
mad, obsessed with Acheronian
sorcery. I have no loyalty to him.

Conan just stares at Lucius. Lucius eyes the axe
uncomfortably.

LUCIUS
I’ve upheld my part of the deal,
Northerner.

Conan rips a small key from Lucius’ keyring. In one motion he
tilts back Lucius’ head, stuffs the key down his throat. A
second later, Conan pours ale into his mouth.

Lucius can’t help but swallow the key.

LUCIUS
By Mitra, what are you doing?

CONAN
Toasting to our deal.

EXT. PRISON - QUARRY - NIGHT

Conan kicks Lucius through the gate into the quarry. The
emaciated inmates stare on in confusion.

CONAN
The key to your shackles sits in
the captain’s gut.

Lucius looks from Conan to the inmates.
LUCIUS

YOU GAVE YOUR WORD. YOU SWORE YOU’D
SPARE MY LIFE.

CONAN
I said I wouldn’t kill you. And I
won't.
But they will...
LUCIUS

BARBARIAN!

Conan leaves Lucius to the inmates, his shrieks turning to
horrific GARGLES. The thief moves to catch up with him.

ELA SHAN
Northerner...
27

Conan doesn’t slow. The cloying thief sprints to catch up.

ELA SHAN
I am Ela Shan. Perhaps you have
heard that there is no lock I can
not break or vault I can not enter.

Conan shakes his head.

ELA SHAN
If you are ever foolish enough to
pursue this man to Khor Khalba,
come see me in Argalon so I can
talk you out of it.

But Conan just walks on.
ELA SHAN

Ask anyone you meet there for Ela
Shan!

EXT. HORNET - OPEN SEA - DUSK

The Pirates unfurl the sails and set out to sea.

INT. HORNET - BELOW DECK - DUSK

Conan places a sword fresh from the fire against his torn
flesh, cauterizing the wound.

Artus inspects Conan’s new injuries. He laughs heartily and
takes a swig straight from a bottle.

ARTUS
They’1l be rioting in Messantia for
days thanks to you!

Artus hands him the bottle but Conan doesn’t take it.

ARTUS
What?

CONAN
I learned the name of the man who
killed my father and took his
sword. Khalar Zym.

Artus is stunned by this information. It’s as if Conan told
him his father was killed by the devil himself.

ARTUS
Zym?! Do you know who that is?
28

CONAN
(shrugging)
I am told he is dangerous.

ARTUS
I am told he is the angel of death.

CONAN
(unimpressed)
I leave tonight to pursue him in
Shahpur.

ARTUS
We can sail as far as the bay near
the Shahpur Outpost.

CONAN
And then you wait for me there.

ARTUS
Wait? Ha! I am not your serving
maid. I will go with you.

CONAN
Not this time, my friend. It is
something I must do alone.

Artus nods in sober silence. Conan is lost in his own dark
thoughts.
EXT. SHAHPUR COASTLINE - EDGE OF RED WASTE - DAY

Conan embarks on his journey, riding his horse, slowly but
relentlessly away from the sea into the unforgiving dunes.

Behind him is the pirate ship, waiting in the bay.

Around him, waves of heat rise from the sand, causing his
image to ripple as if on the surface of water.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - FASSIR’S CHAMBER — DAY

We dissolve to ripples in an actual pool of water, and the
reflected face of a beautiful woman, UPSIDE DOWN, for she is
sitting on the opposite side.

TAMARA (0.C.)
What is it you see, Master?
29

Reveal FASSIR, 70's, elder monk, staring into the pool, and
inhaling deeply from an ornamental hookah. He reads the
ripples on the water like a seer reading tea leaves.

FASSIR
It is unclear. I see a journey. I
see a man crossing the sands.

Kneeling opposite is TAMARA, 20, a monastery student. The
lines of her robed body flawless. Her eyes sharp and bright.
She wears a distinctive NECKLACE with a jeweled amulet.

TAMARA
A knight?

FASSIR
A warrior.

A half circle of young FEMALE STUDENTS, in similar robes and
necklaces, kneel with Tamara around the old man as if before
a guru, and shoot furtive glances back and forth.

FASSIR
Your paths will merge. He will take
you home, to your birthplace...

But the trance seems to lift, and Fassir stops himself from
talking, as if he has said too much. The master continues to
gaze into the pool with a uneasy expression.

TAMARA
Is that all you see?

FASSIR
(shaking his head)
That is all. Continue your
exercises.

Fassir seems disturbed by the reading, but he closes his
eyes, retreats within himself, and will not say more.

Sensing class is over, the girls hop to their feet and
scamper to the exit. Tamara is surrounded by friends who
attempt to cheer her up.

TAMARA
Why would I be in the Master's
visions?

FEMALE STUDENT #1
Oh, everyone knows you are his
favorite.
30

FEMALE STUDENT #2
(teasing her)
Perhaps this warrior will be noble
and pure, sweeping you off your
feet and onto his dark steed.

TAMARA
(rolling her eyes)
Perhaps the Master had too much of
that pipe.

ON FASSIR

His eyes open and he looks away from the pool, thinking.

EXT. FORBIDDEN FORREST - SHAHPUR RAVINE - DAY

A SINGLE DOT ON THE HORIZON, a rider wrapped in a scarf to
protect against the sun.

It’s Conan. He reaches the end of the desert, and through the
jagged Shahpur Ravine, enters an ominous forest thick with
gnarled trees and jagged rocks.

EXT. RED FOREST - DAY

An EERIE FOG blankets the rocks and trees. Shapes move like
dark creatures in murky water, rising and emerging as FIGURES
ON HORSEBACK in stark silhouette.

A CLOAKED FIGURE leads them forward, and Ukafa appears behind
her...

UKAFA
To what cursed land have you led us
now?

The Cloaked Figure removes her hood, revealing...

MARIQUE
The pureblood is close. I can taste
her in the air.

Marique has grown up and become a powerful, intense and
perverse young witch. We recognize her by her missing
eyebrows and hairline, as she sniffs the air.

Around her belt is the familiar HILT of Corin’s broadsword.
She grasps and strokes the handle with perverse excitement.

Behind her, an imposing figure rides forward. The fog
obscures his face but his voice is unmistakable.
31

KHALAR ZYM (0.C.)

The mists they summon have hidden

them well, Marique.

MARIQUE

Not well enough, father...
I/E. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST - TUNNEL - DAY
Marique rides on ahead, leading the way like a bloodhound.
Behind her through the mist, the very earth seems to rise up
in a wave. It is an army of Black Riders.

She takes them to a cliff wall, and a HIDDEN TUNNEL.

EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - BALCONY - DAY

Fassir walks out onto a balcony that overlooks the monastery
grounds, its plaza, and the north gate. Quiet and austere.

Below him, his female students exercise with balance staffs,
moving in well-practiced forms and routines. On the grounds,
monks prepare rituals and tend to flocks.

ON TAMARA - FASSIR’S POV

She stands out from her peers - more balanced, more focused,
and more radiant.

ON FASSIR
He watches with an expression of sadness and concern.

Then Fassir is distracted by a RUMBLE. Ripples dance across
the reflecting pool. His students look around, curious.

The rumble gets louder, monks look around in confusion.

A LINE OF BLACK RIDERS CHARGE INTO THE MONASTERY, led by
Marique, like a hound leading the hunt.

The monks and their sheep scatter. One freezes, watching in
disbelief as the horseman tramples him.

Tamara gawks in horror as more invaders pour into the
monastery square and impale fleeing monks on THROWING SPEARS.

Several Black Riders carry STANDARDS marked with the image of
the ACHERONIAN SEAL. Behind them trails a War Carriage drawn
by four horses.

Fassir flees the balcony.
43A

32

EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - VARIOUS - DAY 43A
WARRIOR MONKS fire arrows from rooftops and raised balconies.

One monk takes out a rider with an arrow to the neck. The
riderless horse barrels through a nearby market stand.

A brigade of monks, men and women, charge from a monastery
building. These warriors wear no armor, battling with
balanced staffs, using a Shaolin-inspired fighting style.

Tamara fights shoulder to shoulder with the others.

A warrior monk leaps onto the back of one of the attacker's
horses, crushing the rider’s skull with his staff.

But even as the warrior monks engage the horsemen, Ukafa and
his retinue of spearmen pour into the monastery grounds,
surrounding them.

Cherin and a line of archers return fire at the monks on the
rooftops, and several monks are hit.

Then MORE waves of Black Riders wash in, each better armed
and more intimidating than the last. This is no ragged troupe
of bandits. This is an army, vast and indomitable.

Then, for a moment, nuns and monks alike are frozen in awe.
Tamara looks out to see, coming out of the tunnel...

...THE MAN OF WAR, a gargantuan siege ship retrofitted as a
movable fortress, glides across the ground as if upon an
ocean, borne on the back of twenty four elephants.

Standing at its bow, magnificent and terrible, in the black
armor of a future emperor, is Khalar Zym.

EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - PLAZA - DAY

Tamara fights through the madness of battle, searching
desperately for someone. All around her, the warrior monks
struggle to hold off the invaders. They don’t stand a chance.

TAMARA
(to the Monks)
We must protect the Master!

She gets no answer. The marketplace has become a killing
field. Monks are being slaughtered left and right. Agile and
quick, Tamara is one of the few fighters to survive and
retreat.
33

ATOP THE PANTHEON STEPS

Spearmen execute the male monks, kicking their lifeless
bodies down the marble steps. A carpet of the dead stretches
from the steps to the reflecting pool.

ON KHALAR ZYM

He directs his army from the bow of his land ship, and
observes the genocide with triumph and satisfaction.

ON MARIQUE

She moves down the line of bound and captured female monks,
who kneel and bow their heads.

She removes a glove, revealing her FINGERNAILS, a series of
STYGIAN NEEDLES sewn into her fingertips.

Marque examines each girl by piercing her skin with a needle,
removing a drop, and then licking the needle’s edge to taste
it. With each girl, she shakes her head.

Next, UKAFA, following along behind her, lifts his spear and
skewers the one she just tested; the girl’s limp corpse drops
onto the hard marble floor.

With each girl it’s the same: Marique tests the blood, shakes
her head, and turns to the next as Ukafa executes.

MARIQUE
Which one of you is the pureblood?
The one who points her out will be
spared.

STUDENT #1, looks up, confused; her lips are defiantly shut.
Marique doesn’t bother to test her and just nods to Ukafa who
plunges his spear in her back.

Impatient, Marique marches down the line, until she sees
FEMALE STUDENT #2 at the end. Her dress and jewelry make her
stand out. She looks regal.
Marique stares at her, and her eyes seems to sparkle.

MARIQUE

(triumphant)
You. You are the one.

Female Student #2 is too terrified and confused to speak.

Marique grabs the student by the hair, yanks back her head,
and buries a long needle deep into the girl’s neck.
34

As she screams, Marique withdraws the syringe with a drop of
her blood. Marique places it to her tongue, and tastes it.

Ukafa and other Kush warriors wait for the result with bated
breath. Eager. Hopeful.

Then Marique spits, both disgusted and frustrated.

MARIQUE
Not pure.

With offhand brutality and the speed of a striking snake,
Marique sinks two finger-needles INTO HER VICTIM'S EYES.

The girl falls forward, dead before her face hits the marble,
and Marique walks past the end of the line.

EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - ATRIUM - DAY
Tamara rushes for the atrium, but stumbles.

She scrambles to her feet to see a War Carriage cutting her
off, circling wildly and then bearing down upon her, a
bloodthirsty Aquilonian warrior at the reins.

Tamara raises her staff to defend herself as the carriage
barrels forward, threatening to run her down.

Someone GRABS HER ARM and tugs her out of the way at the last
moment...

It is Fassir.

A monk's arrow pierces the Aquilonian driver’s chest. Five
other MONK PROTECTORS, all on horseback, ride up alongside
the War Carriage, taking control of the horses.

FASSIR
Get into the carriage.

TAMARA
NO! I will defend our home!

FASSIR
For the sake of your people you
must leave this place and go to the
monks in Hyrkania. It is your duty.

Do not hesitate and do not waver.
Tamara steps up to get inside the carriage.

TAMARA
I don’t want to leave you here.
35
FASSIR
Do you trust me, Tamara?

TAMARA
With my life. With everything I...

The master touches her cheek, his eyes clear and unblinking.
FASSIR
Then ask no more questions, and do
as I say.

EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - PLAZA - ON REMO - INTERCUT

As Remo finishes off the wounded and dying, he looks out
towards the western gate and sees...

WESTERN GATE - REMO’S POV

Fassir firmly pushes Tamara inside the carriage and shuts the
door. A monk takes the driver’s seat and whips the horses.

ON REMO
He waves to his Horse Warriors.
REMO
Let none escape!
EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - TUNNEL - DAY

The War Carriage flees through the gate with 6 MONK RIDERS,
three in front and three behind.

They go through the cave system, a series of intertwining
rabbit holes lit by shafts of light.

EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - GATE - DAY

Remo and a dozen Horse Warriors CHARGE INTO THE TUNNEL,
pursuing the Monk Riders and the captured war carriage.
EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY

Tamara and her escort ride out from the tunnel out into the
FORBIDDEN FOREST. They continue out into the foggy forest.
36

EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - DAY
ATOP THE PANTHEON STEPS, Fassir stands, beaten and bruised.

Behind Khalar an Acolyte holds the Acheronian Mask as a
battle standard. Fassir looks up at this Acheronian artifact
with horror - like a German pacifist viewing a swastika.

KHALAR ZYM
You know who I’ve come for. Why
suffer over it?

FASSIR
None of the ancient blood line
remain. Your search is in vain.

KHALAR ZYM
If that is true, why have you monks
hidden here for a thousand years?

FASSIR
We live here in peace. We have no
riches. We do not make war. We
value life.

Khalar’s expression goes dark.

KHALAR ZYM
You value life? Have you forgotten
what happened in the forests of
Ophir?

Khalar moves closer.

EXT. OPHIR FORREST CLEARING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
A woman dressed in black flees through dark woods.

Around her dogs bark and torches glow. She runs in a wild
panic. When she finally bursts into a clearing, an angry mob
emerges from the trees to surround her.

KHALAR ZYM (V.O.)
Did not ALL the nations of Hyboria
hunt a woman down like an animal?

MALIVA, a mysteriously beautiful young woman, with wicked
eyes like her daughter’s, is lashed to a wooden Vitruvian
Wheel, her hands and feet tied to a central cross.
37

KHALAR ZYM (V.O.)
Were not both my daughter and I
forced to watch as Maliva, my
innocent wife, was lashed to the
wheel and set aflame?

The wheel burns. Maliva wails in suffering. The fire consumes
her body, burning her luminous white skin coal black.

Bound in chains and forced to watch, their faces blank with
shock, are Khalar and the child Marique.

We HOLD ON KHALAR’S FACE and...

MATCH DISSOLVE:

EXT. HIDDEN MONASTERY - DAY

CLOSE ON the older Khalar Zym, perhaps the most cold blooded
man in Hyboria, who cannot stop his voice from breaking.

KHALAR ZYM

It is death you value, and so you
must suffer and kneel to me, like
all the rest.

(composing himself)
It is I who seek the power to give
life. I’ve travelled to the four
corners of Hyboria for it.

FASSIR
The monks here had no part in her
death.
Khalar waves him off.

KHALAR ZYM
Where is the one I seek?

Fassir stares blankly into space, lips closed tight.

Khalar’s eyes narrow. He nods to Marique. She traces a needle
under Fassir’s cheek, slow, like a lover’s caress.

MARIQUE
Oh, he will tell me his secrets, as
have all others before him.

But just as she dips her needle in a vial of oily liquid and
prepares to pierce his flesh...

The old man looks up, his eyes suddenly flashing defiantly.
38

FASSIR

Your vain pursuit for the secrets
of Acheron is a lust for power not
a love of life. Your “innocent”
wife sought to enslave all of
Hyboria with her sorcery, and so
she deserved to burn.

(beat)
You will never rule, and Maliva
will never rise again.

Khalar stares at him blankly, and then EXPLODES WITH RAGE.

He SMASHES FASSIR’S FACE against the marble steps, again and
again and again. The rounded up monks watch in horror as
Khalar, finished, tosses Fassir’s limp body down the steps.

HORSE WARRIOR (0.S.)
M-m-my lord...

One of Remo’s Horse Riders approaches. He looks very nervous
to be bearing bad news.

HORSE WARRIOR
I’ve been sent to tell you that
a... a... a woman has escaped to
the South. But, Remo himself along
with his men are in pursuit.

Khalar nods slowly. Marique grits her teeth. The Horse
Warrior cringes, expecting his hand to be cut off.

But Khalar smiles, satisfied.
KHALAR ZYM

She must be the one. Remo will

surely capture her.
EXT. FORBIDDEN FORREST - DAY
The War Carriage and the six Monk Riders follow the twisting
trade route, surrounded on both sides by steep rock and
trees. The men’s faces are chapped and white with dust.

ABOVE THEM - ROCKY LEDGE

Conan crouches on a rocky ledge, and spots the carriage
advance across the path, plumes of dust in its wake.

He unwraps a delicately engraved instrument shaped like a
long slender bone. It’s only when he looks through it that we
realize that it is an ancient LENS.
39

THROUGH THE LENS —- CONAN’S POV

On the side of the carriage he sees emblazoned, THE
ACHERONIAN SEAL.

ON THE CARRIAGE
Meanwhile, the MONK RIDERS see that they are being pursued.

12 HORSE WARRIORS emerge from the clouds of dust behind them.
Three of the Monk Riders fall back to defend the rear.

ROCKY LEDGE

Conan waits until the carriage is about to pass underneath
him, runs along the ledge to match the carriage’s speed...

...And JUMPS!
ON THE CARRIAGE
Conan lands on the roof of the carriage with a THUD.

Monk #1, the driver, looks back in shock, as Conan plunges
his fist through the wooden roof, and TEARS IT OPEN.

However, when Conan looks inside, instead of Khalar, he finds
Tamara staring back at him in confusion.

She SLUGS HIM IN THE JAW. Conan grabs her wrist...

CONAN
Where is he?

With her other hand she shoots a dagger towards his neck.
Conan grabs that wrist too, narrowly avoiding the point. This
girl’s got spunk.

CONAN
Where is Khalar?

TAMARA
Who is Khalar?

Monk #1, the driver, turns to face Conan, but...
PPFFTT! An arrow hits MONK #1 directly in the chest. He reels
backwards. Conan spots the affixed oil-sack on the arrow,

fuse burning...

The oil sack BURSTS INTO FLAME, liquefying MONK #1, and he
falls burning from the carriage and is trampled.
40
Conan looks behind him and sees Horse Warrior #1 lower his
bow and charge directly towards the carriage.
Tamara pokes her head out of the top of the carriage just in
time to see Conan thrust his sword and skewer Horse Warrior
#1 as he attempts to jump aboard.
ON CONAN
He leaps from the carriage onto Horse Warrior #1's horse.

ON TAMARA

As the carriage teeters out of control, Tamara crawls out of
the hole to the exterior front seat and takes the reins.

ON THE HORSE WARRIORS

Remo and his HORSE WARRIORS close in on MONK RIDERS #3, #4,
and #5 guarding the rear. These monks spread out to avoid
being surrounded by Remo’s men.

HORSE WARRIOR #9 swings a bolo and hurls it at Monk Rider #3.
It coils around his neck like a snake. He falls, his head
CRUSHED by a horse’s hoof.

ON CONAN

He looks back and we linger on his face as he RECOGNIZES the
man leading the attack on the carriage and the Monk Riders.

It’s Remo! Conan’s expression becomes steely.
ON TAMARA
She looks back to see that...

HORSE WARRIOR #2 stands on the back of his horse and hurls a
spear. Monk Rider #4 is hit in the back and taken down.

ON CONAN

He sees Horse Warrior #2 raise a spear again, aiming for the
carriage horses, but this time Conan charges, swinging his
sword and chopping Warrior #2’'s legs out from under him.

ON TAMARA

She locks eyes with the mysterious man who is, to her
bewilderment, fighting on her side. Who IS he?

Then she looks back to see Horse Warrior #9 gaining on her.
Suddenly, the rider LEAPS ON THE CARRIAGE rooftop.
4l

Tamara reaches down and pounds the LATCH holding the back
cabin. Once unhooked the carriage pulls free and spirals into
pieces, taking Horse Warrior #9 down with it.

Now Tamara stands on the front axle, and the four horses pull
the remains of the carriage like a chariot.

ON CONAN

He observes the mysterious girl's startling tenacity, and he
locks eyes with her again. Who IS she?

ON REMO

As Horse Warrior #3 preps another explosive arrow and aims it
at Tamara. Remo stops him.

REMO
No more arrows! You will hit the
woman!

Remo engages with MONK RIDER #5, shredding the poor man’s
face with a BRUTAL SPIKED SHIELD.

ON TAMARA

Tamara grabs the CHARIOT WHIP, lashing at Horse Warrior #3.
The whip tangles the front legs of his horse, tripping the
animal, and planting him into the dirt.

Tamara cracks the whip again, snagging Horse Warrior #4 by
the neck. The two then struggle for control of the whip, ina
fierce tug of war.

Tamara tosses the whip handle through the spokes of her own
wheel. The whip tangles, violently snapping the rider’s neck,
yanking him from his horse, and dragging Horse Warrior #4
through the dirt behind her.

Horse Warrior #5 moves to flank Tamara, riding closer. As he
reaches out for her-

CRUNCH! The warrior is slammed from the side, caught
completely off-guard, a T bone collision with another horse.

ON CONAN

Horse Warrior #6 LEAPS ONTO CONAN’S HORSE, facing him,
striking him with his bladed shield.

Conan struggles to fend off the assault - one hand on the
reins, the other blocking the warrior’s attacks.
42

Conan backhands the warrior from his horse. The agile warrior
flips UNDERNEATH THE STALLION, climbing up the other side,
still trying to wedge his shield into Conan’s ribs.

ON TAMARA

Remo leaps from his horse onto the carriage. Reacting
quickly, Tamara leaps onto the carriages’s lead horse.

As Remo clambers after Tamara, she veers the horse directly
for a jagged formation of ROCKS.

Conan, still riding behind the remains of the carriage,
watches Tamara head directly toward the rocks.

Tamara JUMPS THE HORSE CLEAR OVER THE ROCKS. The landing is
tough. Tamara loses her grip, FALLS FROM THE HORSE.

Remo, clinging to the chariot, looks up just as the vehicle
SMASHES against the rocks, flipping end over end. Remo rolls
off the aerial wreck...

.--but instead of breaking his neck, Remo hits the ground
rolling, leaping back onto a different horse.

The last of the escorts, Monk Rider #6, ducks as the carriage
soars right over his head, CRASHING ON HORSE WARRIOR #7.

Conan, riding behind Tamara, watches a SPLINTERED WOODEN
WHEEL break free from the wreck and spin like a frisbee right
at him. He grabs agile Horse Warrior #6, lifts him up and-

SMASH! The wooden wheel breaks most of the warrior’s face.

Conan spurs on his horse, closing the gap. A pair of warriors
spin in their saddles, riding backwards so they can LOB
THROWING SPEARS at Conan. He uses the recovered spiked shield
to protect against the spear attacks.

As he nears, he lobs the shield like a bladed disc, tripping
one of the warrior’s horses.

REMO rides alongside Tamara’s horse. But where is Tamara? He
gets closer, staring in confusion at the empty saddle.

Tamara rises up from the opposite side of the saddle, kicks
Remo square in the jaw, nearly knocking him from his horse.

Tamara has a brief moment to enjoy her victory. There’s
nothing but open trail and a clearing ahead of her.

Then, CONAN SNATCHES TAMARA RIGHT OFF HER HORSE. Tamara tries
to keep hold of her reins, struggling against him.
43

EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - CLEARING - CONTINUOUS
Ahead, the forest trail opens into a clearing.

In the sand sits the rotting remains of an ancient siege
equipment, including a SPIKED TRAP attached by a LONG CHAIN.

Remo launches a BRUTAL BOLA at Conan’s steed. It twists
around the horse’s legs, tripping the animal, sending Conan
and Tamara skidding into the dirt.
Conan rises, wipes mud from his face, looks up to see Remo
and the 3 surviving Horse Warriors. They encircle the
barbarian, weapons readied.
REMO

Step aside, Northerner. The woman

is property of Khalar Zym.
Conan looks over Tamara, bloodied and bruised but unbroken.

CONAN
She is my property now.

Tamara rises and looks at Conan. Your property?
Conan stares the warriors down. Remo removes his helmet.

REMO
You have no claim to her!

CONAN
No. But I have a claim to you.

Remo spurs on his horse, CHARGING Conan. At the last moment
he REARS UP THE ANIMAL, kicking out its hooves.

REMO
(mocking)
And what “claim” is that?

CONAN
Death.

What happens next happens QUICKLY.

Conan SWIPES his broadsword with such force that he knocks
the armored warhorse over. As the beast collapses, Conan
lunges for Remo.

But, Remo’s too quick, diving back, rolling from the saddle.
44

Horse Warrior #10 and #11 attack together. Conan dodges them
and rips away Horse Warrior #10’s weapon. Without slowing,
Conan lodges the weapon into Horse Warrior #11’s chest.

The armored horses scatter in all directions.

Then in one continuing motion, Conan rips Horse Warrior #10
from his saddle and crushes his skull.

Tamara darts for the loose horse but skids to a halt as Remo
leaps atop it from behind, taking it from her.

Warrior #12, the last of Remo’s dozen, charges Conan, but,
Conan grabs the CHAIN, draws it taught, and TRIPS THE HORSE.
Warrior #12 is flipped through the air...

.+. and he is impaled on the SPIKED TRAP.

ON CONAN AND TAMARA

Tamara stumbles and falling to her knees but scrambles back
behind Conan, putting him between her and Remo, who pulls up

on his reins.

Remo looks from one body to another, three men were butchered
in a matter of seconds.

REMO
Impossible... Who ARE you?

Conan raises up his broadsword.
CONAN
When you fight a Cimmerian, even a
boy, you best kill him.
Remo is baffled - what is he talking about?

REMO
I... killed hundreds of Cimmerians.

CONAN
Yes. An entire village. But I
didn’t burn in my father’s forge.

Recognition washes over Remo’s face, and then terror.
CONAN
If you run from me, I will tear
apart the mountains to find you. I
will follow you to Hell!

The little coward turns and GALLOPS AWAY.
45
Conan rushes up to Tamara, grabs her and lifts her up onto
the back of the same horse they were riding before.

TAMARA
What are we doing?

Conan snatches up Remo’s own SPIKED SHIELD. Then he himself
mounts the beleaguered steed.

Together, they gallop after Remo, with Tamara clutching Conan
around his waist.
EXT. RED WASTE - EDGE OF THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

Here the forest gives way to desert - the Red Waste that we
saw Conan crossing earlier.

Conan catches up to Remo. As he gets close, Conan HURLS the
shield at him like a SAW-BLADE FRISBEE...

EXT. RED WASTE - ANCIENT SHIPWRECK - CONTINUOUS

.+. The shield hits Remo square in the back. The force of the
blow throws Remo off his horse, through the air, STRAIGHT
INTO THE SHIPWRECK.

Remo slams into the hull and crumples, unconscious.

Conan pulls up on the reins and dismounts.

Stunned and exhausted, Tamara FALLS FROM THE HORSE to the
sand. She looks up to see...

Black hair hanging in his face, blue eyes burning like flame,
blood-splattered skin glistening like burnished brass, Conan
stands above her like some primitive demigod.

TAMARA
My master told me I would meet you.
He had visions that our paths would
merge.

Conan studies her as if she were barking mad.

CONAN
You are the one that Khalar Zym
seeks?

TAMARA

I know nothing about it.
46

CONAN
(doubtful)
Those were his men chasing you.

TAMARA
They attacked our monastery.

Conan just turns away to examine Remo. He’s still breathing,
but he is out cold.

TAMARA
So... will you escort me to
Hyrkania?

Conan stares off into the desert in the direction of the
forests and the ravine.

CONAN
We will wait for Khalar.

TAMARA
We? There is no “we.” I will go to
Hyrkania as my master instructed.
Conan bristles at being contradicted.

CONAN
I SAID we will wait.

Tamara bristles at being contradicted.

TAMARA
I SAID I will go to Hyrkania.

She stands up, arms crossed and marches away from him
petulantly into the forest. Again, Conan eyes her as if she
must be a raving lunatic.

EXT. RED WASTE - CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

Tamara’s wrists and ankles are bound together and she is tied
to the anchor like a dog leashed to a post.

Remo remains unconscious where he fell, but he is bound.
Conan slaps him but he does not awaken.

TAMARA
Is he dead?

CONAN
Not yet.
47

TAMARA
What are you going to do with him?

CONAN
I will wait for him to awaken. I
want to look him in the eyes when I
kill him.

The relentless trauma of the day finally overwhelms her.

TAMARA
You you are NO knight. You are
not... NOBLE.
(outraged)
This... all of this...
is...BARBARIC.

 

CONAN
(deadpan)
Yes, I am a barbarian. The “civilized
men” were the ones chasing you.

Conan sits beside her in silence. DESERT TOADS cook over the
fire on sticks. Conan takes one and hands her the other.

Tamara takes a tentative, dainty nibble of her frog’s crispy
leg. It revolts her.

CONAN
Do you have a name?
TAMARA
My name Tamara Amaliat Jorvi

Karushan.

Conan just grunts and bites the head off his toad. Tamara
waits for a response, but gets none.

TAMARA
And yours is..?

CONAN
Conan.

TAMARA

Conan? That's it?

CONAN
How many names do I need?

Tamara sighs and tries a more direct tact.
48

TAMARA
Why did you save me... only to tie
me up?

CONAN

Khalar is a hard man to find. As
long as I possess you, he must come
to me.

TAMARA
Possess? I am not your property. I
am not your “possession.”
(gritting her teeth)
Or is it’s your plan to force
yourself upon me? Because if it is -
Hardly. Conan closes his eyes, utterly exhausted.

CONAN
Go to sleep.

TAMARA
And I take orders from no man. I am
a monk of the order of Shahpur and
my people have NEVER -
Abruptly, Conan stuffs a GAG INTO TAMARA’S MOUTH.

Enraged, Tamara glares silently at the back of his head.

EXT. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST - NIGHT

Khalar Zym rides by the Man of War with Marique.

INT. MAN OF WAR - KHALAR ZYM'S CABIN - NIGHT

Khalar stands as Marique, behind him, removes his armor. As
she unbuckles every metal plate and interlocking ring, she
lingers over his body, relishing the well worn ritual.

MARIQUE
No word from Remo and his scouts?

KHALAR ZYM
By dawn, Remo will bring her here.
He has never disappointed me.

INT. MAN OF WAR - ZYM’S CABIN — CONTINUOUS

Marique strips off her father’s breast plate.
49

MARIQUE
So, the prize is near father. At
last you will have not only the
mask but also the blood to fill it.

Khalar runs his fingers over The Mask of Acheron as if were
his wife’s face. It seems to send shivers of euphoria down
his neck. Marique’s eyes narrow.

KHALAR ZYM
Ah, how your mother yearned for the
sorcery of Acheron. Imagine what
secrets she will bring back from
the realm of dead. Imagine how
INDOMITABLE I will become with her
back at my side.

Marique kneels down to remove the plates on Khalar’s legs.

MARIQUE
Yes, and we shall have greatness,
but... if the girl is lost, or the

ritual fails.

KHALAR ZYM
It will not fail.

MARIQUE
But even if it does...

Khalar eyes flash with anger.

KHALAR ZYM
IT WILL NOT! Maliva WILL return.

Still kneeling before him like a supplicant, Marique takes
her father’s imperial hand...

MARIQUE

My powers are growing, father. I
have my mother’s blood flowing
through me. I could uncover the
secrets of Acheron, as she did.

(beat)
I could make them ALL kneel before
you, just as I do now.

She gently kisses her father’s hand. Khalar stares down at
his daughter, studying her gravely and yanks his hand away.

KHALAR ZYM
Yes Marique, you are like your
mother in so many ways.

(MORE)
50

KHALAR ZYM (CONT'D)
(pointed)
But you are... not her.

Her father coldly turns and exits. Marique’s impenetrable
expression melts. For a brief moment, she is devastated.

EXT. RED WASTE - ANCIENT SHIPWRECK - DAWN

The sun is just rising over the sand. Conan pulls the gag
from Tamara’s mouth and gives his thirsty captive water from
a flask.

CONAN
The truth this time. Why does
Khalar want you?

TAMARA
How many times must I say it? I am
only a simple monk. I am of NO
value to a warlord.

But then a weak voice comes from the nearby column.

REMO (0.C.)
She’s lying.

Tamara and Conan look over to the feeble, but now fully
conscious, Remo.

Conan walks over to Remo and grabs him by the throat. Remo
speaks in a rasp.

REMO
It’s her blood. Her blood is
special. She’s last of the
bloodline of Acheron.

Conan raises his sword to run him through...

TAMARA
Wait. Don’t kill him yet.
(to Remo)
You are mistaken. The bloodline
ended a thousand years ago...

REMO
(spitting)
You lie... whore.

TAMARA
(deadpan)
You can kill him now.
51

Tamara turns in a huff, her legs free but her wrists still
bound together...

REMO
(whispering)
No, PLEASE. For her I can get you a
king's ransom! It is true! Khalar
has been searching for a pureblood
descendant for twenty years.

«+. but Tamara lurks, listening nearby.

CONAN
What makes you sure that she is the
one he is looking for?

REMO
All the others are dead. She was
the one who ran away.

Conan thinks this over.

CONAN
We will wait for Khalar.

REMO
He will not come this way through
the ravine. He will travel through
the flatlands. I can show you...

EXT. RED WASTE - COLUMN DESERT - DAY

The landscape is littered with broken columns and the remains
of wars fought long ago, including a catapult.

Tamara and Remo watch as Conan scans the desert with his
spyglass.

THROUGH THE SPYGLASS
The MAN OF WAR moves over the flatlands.

REMO
You see? I speak the truth. If you
want, he will give your weight in
gold for this woman. I will arrange
everything. I will deliver the
message...

CONAN
Yes. You will.

ON THE CATAPULT —- LATER
52

Reveal that REMO is gagged and TIED TO THE BOULDER.

EXT. RED WASTE - DAY

THE MAN OF WAR moves through the flatlands on the backs of
the elephants.

Suddenly, the catapulted rock SLAMS into its side, bursting
the hull like a torpedo.

INT. MAN OF WAR - ZYM’S CABIN - INTERCUT

The boulder crashes through the ceiling, ripping through
Khalar’s prize possessions. An explosion of splintered wood.

MOMENTS LATER

Along with scores of his men, Khalar Zym looks over the
ruined boat. Tied to the massive boulder, is REMO.

From Remo’s mouth, Marique pulls out a ball of fabric in
which is wrapped Tamara’s necklace. On the fabric are words
written in blood.

KHALAR ZYM
What does it say?

MARIQUE
“I have the woman. The Shahpur
Outpost at noon. Come alone.”

She sniffs the fabric deeply and licks the necklace to taste
it. Her father waits anxiously. She turns to him, and nods.

MARIQUE
It’s her.
EXT. RED WASTE - COLUMN DESERT - DAY

Conan cuts Tamara free, and walks to his horse, which is
looking much healthier.

CONAN
Come.

TAMARA
Why should I? So you can hand me
over to that murderer?

CONAN
Not if I kill him first.
53

Tamara stands and takes a big step back.

Conan ignores the question and picks up the rope again.
Tamara keeps backing away.

TAMARA
Barbarian, is your head made of
stone? Do you really think he’1l
come by himself?

CONAN
I have a plan.

TAMARA
But even if you kill him, what
then? I have seen his massive army.
Do you think they will just let
us... walk away?

CONAN
It does not matter what happens to
us as long as he dies by my hand.

TAMARA
So you're willing to give up both
my life AND yours... for what?
CONAN

Must I gag you again?

Tamara is backed up against a column, but as Conan RAISES THE
ROPE to tie her...

..-quick as a cat her hand darts out and GRABS THE KNIFE ON
HIS BELT. She crouches like a warrior, holding the blade with
remarkable skill.

Conan stares, eyes blazing, and she stares back defiantly.

EXT. SHAHPUR OUTPOST - DAY

From afar the crumbling stone structure seems abandoned and
lifeless. Vultures circle overhead.

EXT. SHAHPUR OUTPOST - COURTYARD - DAY

The Shahpur Outpost was once a working fortress, and rickety
scaffolding, ladders and platforms remain. On the ground sit
loading docks, old farm and construction equipment.
54

Conan stands and waits. Any who approach the fortress can be
seen. He looks to the walls, to the entrance, to nearby
hills. He sees no one. He continues to wait.

Wind rattles the planks and kicks up dust.

Behind him Tamara stands BOUND TO A POST like a prisoner. Her
lips move as if in silent prayer.

Conan looks down at his hand. With his index finger he traces
the old scar on his palm left by the heated chain.

Then he closes his eyes and breathes. This is the moment he
has been waiting for his adult life.

Conan paces. Each footstep crunches loudly in the sand. His
sword rattles in its sheath. Amplified in the quiet.

He looks at Tamara again and she back at him, her eyes fierce
and inscrutable. They hear footfalls of an approaching horse.

Conan turns to face the entrance. Every sense on high alert.

Riding in slowly on a magnificent white warhorse, resplendent
and regal, is Khalar Zym.

Conan stands motionless, only his eyes move to track the
warlord as he trots casually to a crumbling platform opposite
him across the courtyard. Khalar dismounts.

The warlord stands atop the ramp, statuesque; the sun gleams
off his gilded armor, and he shimmers like a god.

Conan, ragged and primitive, painted in dust and dry blood,
stares back at him. Khalar does indeed seem to be alone.

Khalar takes a moment to look over at Tamara. His expression
betrays nothing but curiosity and vague amusement.

Then he looks back at Conan, eyes narrowed.
KHALAR ZYM
You are bold, Northerner. I admire
valor, even in the foolish.

Khalar tosses a CANVAS BAG down into the courtyard, GOLD
COINS spilling across the sand.

KHALAR ZYM
Your reward.

CONAN
I don’t want your gold.
55

A long moment. Khalar studies Conan. Finally,

KHALAR ZYM
What then do you want?

Conan draws his sword.

CONAN
Your head.

Conan jumps down and strides towards his foe. Khalar Zym
nods and sighs, as if already bored with this.

KHALAR ZYM
Yes. Yes. Of course.
(aside)
Kill him...
ON MARIQUE

Peering out from the shadows high atop the outpost walls near
the entrance, Marique lips move in silent incantation. Her
fingers fondle the hilt of Corin’s sword.

THE COURTYARD

The ground between Conan and Khalar ripples... and EXPLODES.

THREE STYGIAN SAND WARRIORS burst from the dust, covered in
branded glyphs and armed with bladed gauntlets.

Conan swings his sword, but the Stygians dive through the
sand as if it were water, and burst up from behind him.

They circle the barbarian, like hyenas assaulting a bear.

Stygian #1 launches a bladed skyhook, but Conan dives out of
the way, rolling back to his feet.

Stygian #2 catches the skyhook with his gauntlet, and quickly
hurls it, spinning back toward Conan, slicing open his side.

The Stygians toss the skyhook back and forth, trapping Conan
in the center like some murderous circus act.

ON KHALAR
Between him and Tamara, the Sand Warriors assault Conan. So,

he calmly but purposefully walks around the perimeter of the
Outpost towards the bound and helpless woman.
56

ON CONAN

He rips off a plank from the loading ramp. As the skyhook
flies at him he swings out the plank, CATCHING THE SKYHOOK,
its jagged tip piercing deep through the wooden plank.

And he hurls the entire plank, end over end, SPLITTING
STYGIAN #1 with the makeshift axe. Stygian #1 doesn’t bleed;
he falls apart, returning to mud and raw earth.

Conan tosses Stygian #2 off his back at the parapet wall. The
warrior flips in mid-air, rebounding back at Conan.

This time, Conan catches him with his broadsword, and Stygian
#2 BURSTS in an explosion of dirt, leaving only his weapons
to clatter to earth.

Stygian #3 leaps up from the sand behind him...

ON TAMARA

As Khalar gets closer and closer, Tamara stays perfectly
still... right to the point that he reaches out to GRAB HER.
ON CONAN

He whips his sword and the tip catches his attacker, slicing
Stygian #3. His RIGHT ARM AND LEG dissolve a shower of dirt,
his BOW AND QUIVER falling to the ground...

ON KHALAR

Khalar moves to cut the ropes binding Tamara’s hands, but in
one swift motion, she reveals THE KNIFE HIDDEN BEHIND HER
BACK and tries to drive it into Khalar’s neck.

She was never really bound at all.

Khalar jumps back, narrowly avoiding the point, and
instinctively draws his sword. But he hesitates, not wanting
to harm his prize.

TAMARA
Conan!

Khalar turns to see the Northerner bolting towards him.
CONAN
Run, woman! FLEE!
EXT. SHAHPUR OUTPOST - CONTINUOUS

Conan and Khalar meet in a LOUD CLASH and SPARK of steel.
57

CONAN AND Khalar DO BATTLE. Conan unleashes furious strike
after furious strike, and it’s all Khalar can do to block
them. Conan is fast, skilled, and incredibly strong.

ON TAMARA

Doing as she was told, she flees towards the exit. But
reaching up from the sand, STYGIAN WARRIOR #3 reaches out
with his remaining arm and GRABS HER FOOT.

Tamara falls to the ground, turns over, and hacks at him with
her dagger...

ON CONAN AND KHALAR

Khalar is shocked to face such a worthy opponent. Khalar
parries and jumps back out of reach of Conan’s long,
dangerous blade. Khalar circles his foe, sizing him up.

KHALAR ZYM
Who ARE you?

CONAN
I am the boy you left behind,
holding a chain, to watch his
father die.

Recognition washes over Khalar’s face.

An unexpected up-swipe of Conan’s sword clips Khalar’s
helmet, knocking him to the ground.

KHALAR ZYM
Cimmerian...

Khalar is vulnerable. With a feral cry Conan LEAPS to impale
him, but Khalar is too quick. He rolls, avoids the falling
sword, and springs to his feet.

KHALAR ZYM
There, that was your chance. You
won’t get another.
(beat)
Wouldn’t your father be ashamed?

Now Conan unleashes all his rage, rushing Khalar...
ON TAMARA

She drive her blade into Stygian Warrior #3's face, and it
POPS like a balloon filled with dust.
58

ON CONAN AND KHALAR

Conan’s blows become wild and reckless, and Khalar handles
them easily, revealing that Khalar too is a warrior of
breathtaking skill.

Well aimed counter strikes push Conan back. More and more,
Khalar takes advantage of his opponent’s loss of composure.

With nowhere to go, Conan is forced up a loading ramp.

EXT. SHAHPUR OUTPOST - COURTYARD - ON MARIQUE - CONTINUOUS

Marique readies a double-bladed DAGGER, dipping its points in
black poison. She raises it up, and prepares to throw...

ON CONAN

He hears the whistle of the knife and dodges it, but the
razor sharp missile nicks his thigh.

Then Conan raises his sword just in time to block Khalar’s
heavy blow, the weapon glancing off his blade.

CONAN’S POV

Sounds become warped, and Khalar seems to move in slow
motion, spinning and twirling his weapon.

Conan’s own arms are heavy. He struggles to focus his eyes.
ON KHALAR

Now Khalar dodges Conan’s clumsy, off-balance blows, and
dazzles his groggy opponent with a three-part attack ending
in a SLICE TO CONAN’S SIDE.

Then Khalar delivers a KICK to Conan’s chest, knocking him
back onto the stack of rotting barrels.

Khalar leaps onto the barrels, looming over Conan, weapon
ready for the kill.

THUNK! An arrow lands inches away from Khalar’s skull and
pierces a rotting barrel. Seeing it’s a BURNING OIL BAG,
Khalar dives away.

A BALL OF FLAME drives him to the ground.

ON TAMARA

She lets fly another arrow from the Stygian’s quiver.
59

ON KHALAR

He rolls away and the arrow just misses him. BOOM! A rotting
cart explodes into flames. Khalar scrambles back further.

ON CONAN

Tamara rushes to the barbarian as he struggles to his feet,
the world spinning around him. Some noxious substance bubbles
poisonously along the cut to his neck.

ON THE ENTRANCE

Suddenly Khalar’s warriors, led by Marique, swarm the
entrance and the crumbling walls.

Khalar rushes towards them from one direction. Marique and a
horde rush toward them from the other...

...Tamara slides under Conan’s arm, grabs Conan’s wrist and
pulls it up so that THE SWORD IS AT HER THROAT.

Khalar Zym stops dead in his tracks, holding up his hands and
calling out to his warriors.

KHALAR ZYM
Stop! She mustn’t be harmed.

Tamara and Conan back away... towards the wall. Conan is
losing a lot of blood VERY fast.

Now the outpost is teaming with Khalar’s fierce warriors,
blocking every conceivable exit.

KHALAR ZYM
There is only one way out of the
fortress. You're trapped. Give her
to me, and I’1l let you live.

TAMARA
(low, to Conan)
Is this your plan? This is a very,
very bad plan.

Gathering all his remaining strength and focus, Conan grabs
Tamara, and rushes backwards AWAY FROM THE EXIT.

The soldiers swarm after them, racing around the outpost to
the left, storming across the outpost from the right.

And, Khalar bares down on them with sword raised.

Conan and Tamara keep going scrambling up scaffolding to the
top of the rear outpost wall.
60

ATOP THE WALL

Tamara stops at the edge - a vertiginous drop to cliffs and a
raging sea.

TAMARA
There’s nowhere to go...!!!

CONAN
But down.

Shocking all who watch, Conan and Tamara LEAP off the wall
out INTO OPEN AIR BESIDE A WATERFALL, plummeting down toward
the harbor below.

EXT. VILLAYET COAST - SHAHPUR OUTPOST - MOMENTS LATER

Khalar looks down in shock. Marique joins her father, but
avoids his accusing stare. His tone is low but dismissive, as
if she were some annoying insect.

KHALAR ZYM
Your sorcery has failed me... and
your weakness sickens me.

Marique backs away from him shocked and wounded by his words.
Khalar continues to stare out to sea, and then...

MARIQUE (0.C.)
My weakness? It was I who found
her. MY “WEAKNESS?!!"

Khalar turns and looks off screen, and what he sees makes his
heart skip beating and his lungs strain for air.

All the warriors suddenly freeze, looking up...
REVEAL MARIQUE
She dangles The Mask of Acheron over the side of the wall.

MARIQUE
Watch my sorcery shatter the mask
and scatter the pieces in the sea.
Watch me tear the eyes from your
soldiers and set the walls aflame.
(beat)

And then, AND THEN will you dare
call me WEAK?!

For a LONG BEAT, both are motionless, The Mask hanging
precariously between her nimble fingers.
61

But then her father smiles, charming as the biblical serpent,
and he slowly walks towards her.

KHALAR ZYM
Forgive me for scolding you. We are
SO close to everything we have
spent our lives pursuing.

He reaches out and touches her cheek, and her anger cools. He
gently takes The Mask away. Once again she bows her head.

KHALAR ZYM
I want you to use all your unique
and valuable gifts... to find her

again.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. OCEAN - DAY

The Hornet sails over water sparkling in the sunlight.

INT. HORNET - BELOW DECK - NIGHT
CLOSE ON rippling water under candle light.

A white rag is dipped in a basin of clear water. It runs up
and down bronzed skin, washing away the soil and blood.

CLOSE ON CONAN - FEVER DREAM

Conan slips in and out of consciousness and fever dreams. A
FORGE burns brightly with FIRE. He’s bathed in sweat.

CONAN (0.C.)
My skin burns.

TAMARA’S FACE appears, going in and out of focus, hovering
over him like a ghost, and the forge flames die down. Her
voice is soothing and maternal.

TAMARA
Don’t speak. You were poisoned and
your wounds are inflamed. It’s
given you fever.

RAGS press, cool and wet, to his cheeks. HISSSS! A sword is
quenched in icy water, steam rises around his flesh.

TAMARA’S HANDS cleanse his wounds and wrap them in bandages.
Still hallucinating, Conan flinches and growls in pain.
Tamara cradles his head and lifts him up.
62

TAMARA
Hush. Hush now. Drink this.

COOL WATER gushes from a flask over his CHAPPED LIPS, and
Conan falls back asleep...

INT. HORNET - BELOW DECK - DAY

As Tamara washes him, she can’t help being taken by both the raw
physical beauty of his rippled flesh and the astounding physical
punishment he’s endured.

She examines his palms, the ten year old scars from gripping
the red-hot chain. As she touches his scar, CONAN GRABS HER.

She gasps. He’s disoriented, still a bit delirious.

CONAN
Where am I?

TAMARA
You are with friends. Though I was
surprised to find you had any.

He releases her, and winces. His wounds and internal injuries
causing him great pain, he struggles to his feet.

TAMARA
Don’t get up. You’ve lost too much
blood. Your stitches will burst!

CONAN
CROM! Enough of your ceaseless
prattle.

He falls to one knee, clutches his side, and rises again.

TAMARA
Where do you think you’re going?

CONAN
To find Khalar, and cleave his
skull to the teeth.

Tamara sighs, exhausted from too little sleep. Her ragged
monk’s gown is torn, bloody, and filthy.

TAMARA
Well, he is not on the boat. Lie
back down. You need to rest.

CONAN
I am well enough.
63

TAMARA
You can barely stand! You think you
are going to kill him now?

CONAN
Yes. If I don’t have you to carry
on my back!

TAMARA
If it weren’t for me you’d be dead.

Conan has no comeback. He exits gruffly to the galley.

INT. HORNET - GALLEY - NIGHT
Artus and Conan sit alone at a table drinking mead.

CONAN
I had him, Artus. I had him.

ARTUS
The gods are cruel.

CONAN
Blast the gods. This was not their
doing. It was I who failed.

ARTUS
Are the tales they tell true? Does he
have fiery red eyes and a hide of
golden scales?

CONAN
He is just a man.

ARTUS
Then it is he who failed. In fact, you
may be the only man in Hyboria to
fight Khalar Zym and live.

Conan spreads a MAP out on the table before them.

CONAN
I must go ashore to find him. Are we
near the coast?

Artus places SHARK’S TEETH on the map: On for Khalar’s position
at Shahpur and one for the boat sailing close to the coastline.

ARTU
Yes. We left him at Shahpur, here.
You must catch him along the costal
roads here...
64

With a third tooth, Artus marks the hidden cove marked by a
fallen colossus.

ARTUS
..--Before he reaches Khor Kalba,
because neither god nor demon can
touch him once he is behind his
fortress walls.

He marks Khor Kalba with the tiny skull of a monkey.

CONAN
He won't go home without the woman.
After I go, you must take her
someplace safe.

Artus laughs, playfully mocking his friend.
ARTUS

What favors does this beauty shower
upon you to win such gratitude?

CONAN
She saved my life. For that she has my
loyalty.

ARTUS

Then she has mine as well.

EXT. HORNET - MAIN DECK - DUSK

At the bow of the boat, his sword gleaming with the setting
sun, Conan practices his moves and strikes. Despite his
injuries he is relentless in his discipline.

Tamara climbs on deck. She now dressed like a HAREM GIRL, her
skin barely covered in the silken drapes, and she doesn’t
look happy about it.

Artus approaches her from the helm. They watch Conan from
afar. His movements have grim beauty.

TAMARA
A charming man, your friend.

ARTUS
(shrugging)
Most men are born to mother’s milk.
But his first taste was of his
mother’s blood. He was battle born.

TAMARA
So all he can do is kill?
65

ARTUS

Oh no. He has the heart of a king. The
loyalty of a bloodhound.

(beat)
Barbarians may be warriors, but they
do not sacrifice their children or
enslave their allies like the priests
and princes of the “civilized” world.

(beat)
As for his manners...

CONAN (0.C.)
You look like a harlot!

Conan lurches past them, eying her clothes with disapproval.
Tamara stares right back at him, matching fire with fire.

TAMARA
Yes, apparently I’m the only woman
you have ever met who isn’t one!

The stare-off continues between the hulk and the pixie. All
the other pirates watch, curious to see what will happen.
Surprisingly, it is Conan who blinks first.

CONAN
(to Artus)
Give her leather and armor.
(to all)
She handles a knife better than any
of you drunken cutthroats!

Conan limps to the helm, clutching his side and cursing as he
goes. Artus smiles at his friend’s outburst.

ARTUS
I think he likes you.
INT. HORNET - GALLEY - NIGHT

Conan sits alone, finally relaxing. He lights a PIPE,
breathes out a plume of smoke, then closes his eyes.

Appearing in leather and armor, Tamara makes both a sexy and
steely warrior. She marches up to him and KICKS his boot.

TAMARA
We have to talk.

His looks says, “Please Crom, kill me now.”
TAMARA
I must go to Hyrkania, as my master
instructed.

CONAN
Artus will take you. I must go ashore
alone and hunt Khalar.

TAMARA
So, you're not using me as bait?

CONAN
No.

Conan offers her the pipe, insisting. She takes it and sits

down beside him.

TAMARA
Why did Khalar slaughter your
village?

CONAN
For a sliver of bone that fit into
a mask.

TAMARA

The Mask of Acheron?

CONAN
What do you know about it?.

Tamara smokes, inexpertly, and COUGHS.

TAMARA
I only know the stories I heard as a
girl. 3000 years ago in the empire of
Acheron, Necromancers discovered
powerful magic and enslaved almost all
of Hyboria. It was their mask.

She looks at the WATER SHIMMERING IN THE BUCKET just as

Fassir gazed in his pool...

INT. KHOR KALBA - SKULL CAVE - TAMARA’S VISION

Tamara’s face dissolves to a vision of the Mask of Acheron.
The abstract images look like shadows on rippling water.

TAMARA (V.O.)

They crafted it from the bones of
kings, and sacrificed their
daughters to their baleful gods.
67

We see hazy, murky images of a lithe body being strapped to a
VITRUVIAN WHEEL before a SACRIFICIAL PIT.

The Acheronian wizard, holding the mask, raises a SACRIFICIAL
SWORD, and slices his own flesh at his chest.

He fills the mask with his own blood, and the bone shards writhe
like tentacles.

TAMARA (V.O.)
Then the barbarian tribes rose up
and shattered the mask.

We see dreamy abstract images of battle; the MASK IS SHATTERED
into dozens of sharp slivers of bone.

TAMARA
The slivers were indestructible. So,
each tribe HID A PIECE, scattering
them across the land.

INT. HORNET - BELOW DECK - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENE

Back on Tamara’s face, her vision becoming more intense.

CONAN
What does the mask do?

TAMARA
Resurrection. It raises the souls
of the unspeakably evil.

Like Fassir, Tamara’s face twists in horror at the vision in
the shimmering water...

EXT. BALD MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

TAMARA (V.O.)

The spirits and demons they summoned
gave them powers no mortal men should
hold.

The vision swells into a panoramic view of thousands of
slaves driven over fiery rocks and crimson water. It’s like a
vision of Hell by Hieronymus Bosch.

INT. HORNET - BELOW DECK - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENE

Horrified, Tamara snaps out of her trance, but she is groggy.
Her eyes flutter open and shut.
68

CONAN
What?
TAMARA
I... I’m not sure if I saw a vision

of the past or of the future.
Tamara struggles to focus, but she is nodding off.

CONAN
What did you see?

TAMARA
Kingdoms in ruin. An ocean of
blood. An... apocalypse...

Tamara passes out from pipeweed. Conan gently takes her in his
arms and puts her gently down on the bed of straw.

THUMP. He hears something brush the hull of the ship. It’s
very soft, but it still troubles him...

INT. HORNET - GALLEY

The Pirates, Artus among them, lie asleep on benches, some on
the floor. None of them hear another dull THUMP.

EXT. HORNET - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The sea is dead calm, like a sheet of black marble. The main
deck is eerily quiet and still.

Conan walks up above deck. He hears a soft THUMP again. He
crosses the deck, and looks over the side of the boat.

There he sees an empty RAFT and a ROWBOAT in the water, tied
to the side of the ship, gently brushing the hull.

Alarmed, Conan looks up to see...
AT THE HELM
The Boatswain lies dead, his throat cut, in a pool of blood.

CONAN
ARTUS!!

AT THE BOW
A DOZEN of Khalar’s warriors, Kush spearmen and Turanian

Raiders, swarm over the rail like ants from small boats
below. They rush across the deck, weapons raised...
69

Unarmed, Conan turns and turns back, grabs a HAMMER and slams
the iron shell of an ALARM BELL...

INT. HORNET - GALLEY - INTERCUT

CLANG! Artus’s eyes snap open. He jumps to his feet and
rushes out. The other pirates are groggy and slow to awaken.
INT. HORNET - BELOW DECK - NIGHT

CLANG! Tamara is startled awake. She stands up from the bed
of straw, but suddenly...

UKAFA GRABS HER and covers her mouth. As she kicks and bucks,
he drags her through the claustrophobic corridors.

UKAFA
Be still.

Tamara sinks her teeth into Ukafa’s hand. Ukafa squeals in
pain and raises his ugly fist to club her.

CRASH! Conan BURSTS THROUGH the wall behind Ukafa, fist right
through wood, grabbing Ukafa from behind. Tamara breaks free
as Conan shoulders his way through the broken planks.

UKAFA
I remember those eyes...

Ukafa tries use his spear, but there isn’t space to maneuver.
Conan grabs the shaft and wrestles for control.

They both buck and thrash, two giants SMASHING one another
into the walls of the hold, like bulls in a pen.

Tamara jumps back, pulls a dagger from her boot, grips the
tip, and raises it up to throw...

But as the two men careen and spin, slamming back and forth,
she can’t get a clear shot. She waits for her opportunity.
Knife raised high. COMPLETELY STILL.

EXT. HORNET - STERN - NIGHT

Artus rushes on deck...

THUNK! Pirate #1 is struck dead. A spear piercing his chest
and impaling him to the mast.

Artus draws his sword just as the defending Pirate #2 is CUT
DOWN by Khalar’s warriors.
70

Artus is completely overwhelmed... driven back by the horde
advancing across the deck towards the galley.

INT. HORNET - BELOW DECK - NIGHT

Conan knocks the spear from Ukafa’s hand, and it sticks butt
first into the splintered wall. This gives the Kush warrior
time to land a fist to Conan’s jaw, knocking him backwards.

They fight now with fists and shards of broken wood. Neither
able to gain the advantage.

Then Conan kicks Ukafa and sends him flailing to the floor.
Ukafa springs to his feet, hand reaching out for his spear...

THUNK! Tamara’s throwing knife pins his hand to the wall,
slicing off one of his fingers. Ukafa SCREAMS!

Then Conan grabs UKAFA by the collar, and with all his brute
strength, lifts the fat assassin up...

CONAN
How many Cimmerians died at the
point of that spear?

..-and THROWS UKAFA ONTO HIS OWN SPEAR, impaling him through
the heart and killing him instantly.

EXT. HORNET - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Only Artus and a few other pirates defend against the
onslaught, fighting valiantly, taking on three and four
invaders each, but there are too many opponents to handle.

Marauders slash through sails and ropes, pressing forward.

Attackers to their right and left, Artus and his men are
driven back against the entrance to the galley.

Cherin leads Khalar’s warriors, bloodthirsty and energized,
on the verge of a complete massacre...

INT. HORNET - GALLEY - NIGHT

Some primal edge to Conan’s voice rallies panicked men to
action...

CONAN
Grab your steel, dogs! Spill some
blood before you greet your
ancestors in Hell!
71

EXT. HORNET - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Just as Artus and his defenders are about to be overwhelmed
and cut down, the tide turns...

ON CONAN
CONAN

NOW is time for the feasting of

swords!
Leaping out from below deck, flying athletically through
space, Conan sweeps his long blade in a wide arc. The sharp
point finds the throat of a hapless warrior, sending a
fountain of blood over the heads of the attackers.
The man is dead before his corpse hits the floor.
THE PIRATES ATTACK!

Bursting from below deck, pirates assault Khalar's Warriors
with battle axes, forcing them backwards to the rail.

ON ARTUS

He hacks, slices, and unleashes a fierce battle cry.
ON CHERIN

She directs warriors away from the central battle.

CHERIN
FIND THE GIRL.

Cherin advances towards the galley when AN ARROW hits the
warrior queen BETWEEN THE EYES. She drops to the deck in a
lifeless THUD!

Tamara stands across deck, bow in hand.

TAMARA
You found me.

ON CONAN

Despite his injuries Conan fights like a god of war. Slicing
right, and hacking left, taking down several warriors at a
time, and completely shattering the enemy’s morale.

ON TAMARA

Now she fights alongside Conan and the pirates, spinning an
elegant dagger in each hand.
72

Her martial arts training is on full display as she parries,
dodges and spins to cut down one warrior and another, until
her blade reaches...

CONAN’S FACE. She stops the knife thrust inches from his
nose. Conan shoots her a look.

TAMARA
Sorry!

ON ARTUS

He swings on a jib, knocking a pair of Khalar's Warriors off
the ship. He drives his sword through another attacker up to
the hilt, then uses the impaled attacker as a human shield.

ARTUS
CONAN.

Conan turns and tosses an attacker towards his friend,
impaling the second warrior upon the blade.

WIDE ON THE DECK

It’s a complete rout. Those few of Khalar’s warriors who are
not cut down leap over the rail in retreat.

SEA BATTLE WITH KHALAR’S WARSHIP - OMITTED

EXT. HORNET - MAIN DECK - NIGHT
The battle is over. Conan raises his bloody sword in TRIUMPH!

Tamara and Conan gaze at each other, burning with battle lust
and the joy of victory. They share a warrior’s handshake.

EXT. OCEAN - DAWN

As the sun rises, the Hornet sails over calm waters.

EXT. HORNET - MAIN DECK - DAWN

The pirates celebrate their victory drinking from mugs and
flasks in rowdy celebration. Conan looks around for Tamara
but he doesn’t see her...

INT. HORNET —- BELOW DECK - DAWN

In a quiet corner, Tamara sets up a simple altar with a
candle, a bowl, and runes scratched into the wood.
73

She has stripped off her armor, and wears her clean monk's
robe - so torn it barely covers her bare flesh underneath.

She kneels before it and prays in a whisper.
TAMARA
Mitra, help overcome whatever sins
I may carry in my blood. Show me my
purpose, and help me find peace.

Conan watches her from the shadows nearby. He is spellbound,
perhaps for the first time, by her extraordinary beauty.

TAMARA

With your gentle wisdom, bless this

man who protects me, and lift his

burden of pain, as you do mine.
Sensing a presence in the room, Tamara looks up...
For a moment their eyes lock. The bare skin on her thighs and
shoulders are luminous in the candle light. His bright blue
eyes are, for once, soft with empathy.
But then he looks away, respectfully, turns and exits.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HORNET - DAY

The pirates work to repair the boat. Fresh planks line the
deck like the scars of healed wounds.

EXT. VILLAYET COASTLINE - WIDE - DAY

The tiny pirate ship sits at the ancient dock. Beyond it is a
rocky shore covered in spectacular, crumbling ruins.

EXT. HORNET - DAY

Conan stands near Artus at the helm, as pirates repair the
wheel. He and Artus share a warrior’s handshake.

ARTUS
May you find what you seek, Conan.

ON TAMARA

She watches Conan gather his weapons and gear on the dock.
Artus joins her at the rail of the ship.
74

ARTUS
Our repairs are almost complete.

TAMARA
Thank you, Artus. I hope one day to
pay you all handsomely for your
trouble.

ARTUS
What do pirates care for gold?

Artus notices how she looks at his friend as he walks towards
the cliffs. Artus pulls out a piece of folded parchment.

ARTUS
It seems our friend has forgotten
his map of the shoreline. I think
you should take it to him... And
say goodbye.

Without hesitation, Tamara takes the map, quickly disembarks
and chases after Conan.

ARTUS
We sail at dawn... Don’t be late!

He watches as Tamara catches up and hands Conan the map. As
he sees the two exchange words and continue walking together,
Artus smiles to himself.

EXT. VILLAYET COASTLINE - DAY

Conan and Tamara climb the rocks up from the shoreline,
Tamara catches up with him. Together they look up at the
ruins of some once grand culture, long forgotten.

TAMARA
They too, whoever they were, once
sought to rule the earth and sea.

The fog parts revealing the fallen remains of an ANCIENT
COLOSSUS STATUE, body crumbled and broken. Tamara gazes up at
the fallen giant.

TAMARA
(re: The Colossus)
Do you ever wonder if our actions
serve some plan - some purpose spun
by the gods? Or like him, are we
all just doomed to chaos and ruin?

Conan speaks without irony or affectation.
75

CONAN
I know not, and I care not. I live,
I love, I slay... I am content.

Tamara stares at him - raw, unrefined, true to himself.

Abruptly, like a damn bursting, she lunges forward and kisses
him. Each grabs fistfuls of the other’s hair.

INT. VILLAYET COASTLINE —- COLOSSUS HEAD - DUSK

A gush of rough ardor and tender caress. Conan and Tamara
buck and writhe in a slip-slide display of the most gorgeous
naked flesh to fill a movie screen.

The waves of nail-raking, back-arching, breast-heaving
ecstacy, rise... froth... and crash upon the sand.

ON CONAN AND TAMARA - LATER - NIGHT

Tamara lies in Conan’s arms by a small fire. She traces her
finger tip over the long scars across his bare flesh, like
roads or rivers on a map.

But when runs her finger tip over the scar that splits his
eyebrow, HE FLINCHES, pulling away the touch, the strange
intimacy of it is more than he can bear.

But seeing the sympathy in her eyes, he relaxes, allowing her
to brush her lips gently against his brow. Then she kisses
his eyelid and the scar along his cheek.

Finally, and perhaps most intimately of all, she takes his
hand, brings it to her mouth and KISSES THE SCAR ON HIS PALM.

His eyes sparkle. He is soothed. He kisses her forehead.
Her head on his shoulder, they stare up through the eye of
colossus at a sliver of THE MOON, which glimmers like a
reflection in an iris.

INT. VILLAYET COASTLINE —- COLOSSUS HEAD —- DAWN

Tamara, fully dressed, gazes down at the sleeping barbarian.
Without waking him, she kisses his cheek.

TAMARA
(whispers)
Goodbye.
76

EXT. VILLAYET COASTLINE - FOREST - DAY

Leaving the ruins behind her, Tamara walks alone through the
woods back to shore, towards the row boat.

Lost in the afterglow, she doesn’t notice the dark, blurry
form of A FIGURE stalking her from the trees.

Sssssst! Tamara flinches as if stung by a bee. She reaches to
the back of her neck and finds stuck there...

A DART in the shape of a bug - similar to the dart that
struck Conan at the Outpost. She YANKS it out and flings it
away.

Panic. Tamara looks around her and glimpses a movement all
around on the path. Her head spins with venom.

She BOLTS, racing back towards the colossus head, stumbling,
gasping for air, the trees melting and rippling around her.

TAMARA
Conan...

Many pursuers rush upon her. She glimpses a shield with an
ACHERONIAN SEAL. A rider appears on the path. And another.

As a dark rider lurches towards her Tamara reacts
instinctively, THROWING HER KNIFE. The rider is hit, and the
horse spooks and BOLTS...

...then Tamara falls. Dizzy. Nauseated. The world a blur.
She thrashes as cruel hands pin down her arms. The last
things she sees before passing out are the needle-nails on
Marique’s fingertips, dangling over her face like a spider.
INT. VILLAYET COASTLINE - COLOSSUS HEAD - DAY

Conan’s eyes snap open at the sound of the muffled roll of
galloping horses.

EXT. VILLAYET COASTLINE - FOREST - DAY

Conan crouches and finds the Stygian needle, discarded on the
ground. Around him are footprints and horse tracks.

Conan’s blue eyes glow, fierce and iridescent in the fading
light. He grits his teeth and snaps the needle in half.
77

Conan stands and walks to the place where the rider fell when
he was hit by Tamara’s knife. There is a heavy imprint in the
mud and a pool of blood.

A shape moves through the brush. Conan whips around to see...

«+. the rider’s abandoned horse, fully armored, with the SEAL
OF ACHERON emblazoned on the metal plates.

Conan’s eyes widen in horror.

EXT. WILDERNESS - WIND AND RAIN - NIGHT
An ashen sky hangs over an ancient trail.

Riding the horse now stripped of its armor, Conan tracks west
across a cold and rocky wilderness.

A bitter wind blows in his face, and even the horse looks
weary and defeated. Conan’s burden has never been greater.

EXT. KHOR KALBA - THRONE ROOM - DUSK

Massive iron doors like inverted fangs swing slowly open.
Into the room comes Khalar’s triumphant daughter, Marique.

Behind her four ACOLYTES lead Tamara in chains. She is still
unsteady and sick from the effects of the poison.

Tamara scans the long room, filled with ominous statues,
mosaics and artifacts of the age of Acheron. She sees Khalar
sitting upon a gigantic throne cut into the stone wall.

As they approach the throne, Marique takes Tamara by the hair
and forces her to kneel.

Khalar steps forward, gazes down at his helpless captive, and
lifts Tamara’s chin so that she looks up into his eyes.

KHALAR ZYM
Hello, my elusive one.

TAMARA
(desperate)
You have made a mistake. I am not
the one you are looking for.

Khalar nods to Marique...

A black needle sinks in Tamara’s neck and she flinches as if
bitten. Marique withdraws it and puts it to her tongue.
78

MARIQUE
She is the pure blood descendant of
the Necromancers of Acheron.
Tamara closes her eyes and holds back tears, all hope lost.

Khalar smiles.

KHALAR ZYM

We begin the ritual at once.
MARIQUE

No... tomorrow night. When the moon

is dark and eager to be reborn, and
the tide ebbs, leaving the ruins

dry.

KHALAR ZYM
You have made me proud, my
daughter.

He touches her cheek, and Marique’s face glows. THE DOORS
BOOM SHUT.

EXT. ARGALON - OUTSKIRTS - DUSK

Conan rides to a hilltop with a wide view, and he gazes down
upon Argalon, a city near the coast with domed buildings.
EXT. DEN OF BLADES - VARIOUS - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS of Conan moving past dilapidated stands.
Loitering thugs and cutthroats trade weapons, poisons and
contraband.

We see him approaching several wily thugs who shake their
heads. Finally a skinny street urchin points to...

A rotting door bears the mark of SEVEN BLADES. Conan opens it
and enters.

INT. DEN OF BLADES - NIGHT

The Den of Blades is a hookah bar - dark, smoke-filled, and
ominously quiet. It functions as a thieves guild, and it is
densely packed with shiny stolen objects like a bazaar.

As Conan crosses from the door, dozens of treacherous eyes
mark him from the shadows. There are belly dancers and women
writhing with snakes.
79

Conan approaches a FAT MAN, who stands and pours colorful
drinks onto a silver three-level serving tray.

CONAN
I am looking for a thief.

FAT MAN
Argalon is a city of thieves.

Conan clutches him by the folds of his neck, the tray falls
to the ground and the drinks spill across the floor.

CONAN
I am looking for a thief named Ela
Shan.
The Fat Man just cackles.

BARMAN
Who are you to ask, Barbarian?

Suddenly from every shadow and every corner, a DOZEN ugly,
treacherous THIEVES of all shapes and sizes, weapons drawn,
stand and leap forward to surround Conan.

Conan crouches and clutches the hilt of his sword...

ELA SHAN
Stand down, fools!

The bandit steps forward. It is Ela Shan himself.

He steps into the light to show off elaborate armor instead
of prison chains; Ela Shan LAUGHS and waves off his men.

ELA SHAN (CONT'D)
Fast as Yezud, he will gut you like
fish. I owe this man my life.
Conan relaxes, sheaths his sword, and eyes the thief.
CONAN
Well, Ela Shan, you will have your
chance to repay it.
Ela Shan’s smile fades.

AT A CORNER TABLE - LATER

Conan and Ela Shan sit and drink. Ela Shan looks anxious,
trying to talk him out of it.
ELA SHAN
It is not for me to criticize a
great man such as yourself but...
This is madness. Don’t go in. Just
wait for him to come out!

CONAN
A woman is inside.

Elan rubs his temple. A woman?

ELA SHAN
She must be a pretty one. Breaking
into Khalar Zym’s fortress is like
reaching under a sleeping dragon to
steal her eggs.
(beat)
It can’t be done.

CONAN
It MUST be... And quickly.

ELA SHAN
(scoffing)
Quickly? No one has done it ina
thousand years!

CONAN
There must be a way. You owe me
this.

ELA SHAN

(shaking his head)
Well, below the flooded spires is
the tunnel of locks.

CONAN
Didn’t you say there is no lock you
can not break?

Ela Shan spits, silently cursing his words.
ELA SHAN

I am without doubt the only thief
alive who could get you through it.

CONAN
Then that is the way.

ELA SHAN
It is the way to “The Dweller” that
guards the fortress depths... or so

the rumors say.

80
81

CONAN
And what is The Dweller?

Ela Shan throws up his hands, and smiles.

ELA SHAN
Certain death.

INT. KHOR KALBA —- THRONE ROOM - DAY

Along the walls are primitive but macabre images of genocides
and slavery - fire and blood. Artifacts of Acheron displayed
as if this were some sinister museum.

A CEREMONIAL TUB - VARIOUS SHOTS

Still weakened and hazy, as if drugged, Tamara sits in s
ceremonial tub. ACOLYTES scrub and cleanse her body, comb and
arrange her hair, clip her nails.

As she rises up from the water, they swath her in red towels
with all the formality of a religious ceremony, drying her
naked skin as if polishing white marble.

As the acolytes anoint Tamara’s bare flesh with oil, Marique
watches over the preparations, darkly.

LATER

Marique grooms the groggy Tamara before a full length mirror
of dark polished obsidian. Tamara is wearing Maliva’s
distinctive dress, her jewelry and dark makeup.

MARIQUE
My mother wore this gown on her
wedding day. It flatters you.

TAMARA
I am NOT your mother.

MARIQUE
No but you will be.

She runs a finger-needle up Tamara’s chest to her neck, and
whispers sadistically.

MARIQUE (CONT'D)
Imagine your body is a vessel and
your soul is the water that fills
it. When your blood seeds the mask,
my father will empty you.
82

As Marique speaks, she takes a long, sinuous glass vase and
pours the water out on the stone floor.

As Marique continues, she refills the vase with red wine.

MARIQUE
And my mother’s soul will rise to
fill up your toes, your legs, up
into your breasts, neck and lips...

She leans in close, lips practically pressed against Tamara’s
cheek.

MARIQUE
«+. until my mother turns your
pretty blue eyes pitch black.

TAMARA
I would rather die.

KHALAR ZYM (0.C.)
Oh yes, you will...

At that moment, Khalar enters, continuing for Marique.

KHALAR ZYM
... and your death shall herald a
New Age of Acheron. The spirits I
raise will melt flesh from the
bones of kings. My wife and I will
cast all rivals into oceans of
blood.

Marique presses the point of the needle hard against Tamara’s
skin, almost but not quite breaking the surface.

MARIQUE
And what of me, father?

Khalar freezes, seeing the deadly nail at Tamara’s throat.

KHALAR ZYM
What of...? Remove your nail.

Marique stares at her father with eerie intensity.
MARIQUE
Why? So that I can be cast aside...
into an ocean of blood?

Nobody moves, but then Khalar approaches his daughter.
83

KHALAR ZYM
So that you may reign as our
princess and heir.

He touches her cheek and she melts, all her rage rushing out
of her like water.

She removes the nail, and hugs him around the waist.
IN THE OBSIDIAN MIRROR
It frames a strange triangle: two women and Khalar between
them. Only Tamara can see that Khalar’s expression is
treacherous, even as his voice is silky and smooth.
KHALAR ZYM
Smile, my cruel angel. Tonight we
will be a family once again.
And looking away from the mirror, only Tamara can see that
Marique’s expression is equally cold and bitter, even as her
voice is sweet and obedient.
MARIQUE
Yes, my dear father. Yes.
EXT. KHOR KALBA - OUTSKIRTS - DUSK
Khor Kalba is the flooded ruins of jagged stone towers that

have stood against the sea for thousands of years. Indeed the
walls and fortifications make it look impregnable.

EXT. KHOR KALBA - FLOODED RUINS - NIGHT
Conan and Ela Shan scramble over rocks along treacherous
cliffs and pounding surf. The find a round rock with a metal

face plate and runes etched around the edges.

Ela Shan slips slender hooks and pointed dowels into the face
plate and opens it, but his hands are shaking badly.

Inside is an ornate locking mechanism.
ELA SHAN
Please. I beg you one last time. Do
not do this. Let us turn back.

Conan shakes his head. Silent but firm.
84

As Ela picks at the mechanism there is a cascade of CLICKS
and CLANKS swelling into a deafening RATTLE as somewhere
massive tumblers spin. The noise becomes frighteningly
loud...

... and then with a SNAP, the lock turns. The stone slides
open in halves revealing stairs down to the flooded sewers.

INT. KHOR KALBA - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

The acolytes bind Tamara to the VITRUVIAN WHEEL. Each wrist
and ankle is bound with MANACLES and long CHAINS to the
spokes. She is spread eagle.

Carrying Corin’s greatsword, Marique approaches Tamara.

MARIQUE
Did you know I met your Barbarian
when he was a boy? I took this
sword from him.

She runs her lips perversely over its hilt.

MARIQUE
I'm told that Cimmerian steel is
sharper and harder than any other,
and that when it cuts, the pain is
close to pleasure.

She holds the edge against Tamara’s bare skin on her chest.
MARIQUE
I know it will please you.
INT. TUNNEL OF LOCKS - CURVING TUNNELS - NIGHT
Ela Shan pops the lock to another spiral gate leading them
into a CURVING SEWER TUNNEL. The water is waist high, and

roiling as if something large were moving below.

Their torches flicker, giving off more smoke than light.
There are deep ominous RUMBLES from above and below.

The surface of the water ripples, as if teeming with fish.
Ela stops and grabs Conan’s arm.

ELA SHAN
Something moves in the water.

As Ela turns we see that clinging to the other side of his
face and neck is a BLACK, THROBBING MASS the size of a
lobster.
85

Ela sees Conan’s expression. The thief SQUEALS in horror,
tears the leach off his face, and throws it away. The water
is alive with the slimy creatures.

Conan rips a GIANT LEECH off his own arm and yanks another
off Ela’s back. Ela finds another squirming on his belly.

Ela’s scream still echoing in the chamber, they hurry,
sloshing towards the next gate.

EXT. KHOR KALBA - RUINS - NIGHT

A procession moves slowly from the central tower, towards the
Skull Cave. Khalar leads them in his resplendent armor. Then
comes Marique leading twelve Guards.

TWO acolytes chant in a long forgotten language and strike
GONGS etched with the Seal of Acheron. It is as ominous as a
funeral march. Ceremonial and grim.

Behind them, another FOUR ACOLYTES bear Tamara on the
Vetruvian Wheel, like a corpse upon a stretcher.

Surrounding the procession is a LEGION of Khalar’s soldiers.

INT. TUNNEL OF LOCKS - BLOOD GATES - NIGHT

Ela and Conan trudge through a long, narrow sewer. Ela is
shaking badly, and he looks a bit lost.

Above them are HOLES in the rock where runoff water gurgles
into the chamber. They reach a DEAD END.

Far above them is a clang and rumble, as if some giant valve
were turning and a torrent of water unleashed.

ELA SHAN
We should not have come this way.

Liquid bursts from the runoff holes and gushes into the
chamber - hundreds of gallons of deep red.

Conan and Ela retreat through the fountains of blood. The
liquid becomes thicker...

... and the two are hit with chunks of human bone, severed
arms, severed legs, and ground gore - a ghastly soup of human
flesh showering down upon them!

They flee, out of the dead end tunnel, as human heads bob in
the water like buoys. Conan drives his shoulder into a gate,
breaking the rusty bars and slamming it open.
86

INT. KHOR KALBA - TUNNELS UNDER THE PIT - CONTINUOUS

Ela Shan reignites a STASHED TORCH. There are no more gates
to be seen. A triumphant smile beams on Ela Shan’s face.

ELA SHAN
That was the last gate. I told you
I could get you in safely!

A great RUMBLING PASSES, the sound of something ENORMOUS
moving underneath them in the depths.

Ela’s smile fades.

WHOOSH! Conan and Ela are DRAGGED UNDER THE WATER, whipped
down and away in less than a second.

INT. KHOR KALBA - UNDER THE PIT - NIGHT

Conan is yanked through deep, murky water. He’s just a
flailing shape in the darkness.

He lashes out with his blade, hacking at something that has
wrapped around his foot like a snake. It releases him.

Ela Shan is not as lucky. He is dragged passed Conan, towards
some MASSIVE THROBBING SHAPE with UNDULATING ARMS, but Conan
grabs Ela by the collar and yanks him free.

Conan drags Ela towards the glow of the surface.

INT. KHOR KALBA - THE DWELLER PIT - NIGHT

Ela and Conan burst to the surface of a circular pool. Both
of them gasp for breath. The danger seems to have passed.

They scramble to the edge, and as they climb out they look up
into the gigantic space around them, taking it all in.

The pool is surrounded by the curving steps and tall columns
of a massive amphitheater. The air is thick with steam.

Above them, cages hang from pulleys attached to an iron grid.
Chains strung through the pulleys hang like vines.

Inside the cages are virgins, ADOLESCENTS in nothing but
loincloths. One cage near the water is filled with the same
blood and remains that were showered upon them below.

AKHOUN (0.C.)
YoU!
87

Conan looks across the pit to see the last of Khalar’s
henchmen who was present in Corin’s forge.

AKHOUN

The giant villain holds chains attached to pulleys high above
him on the iron grid. This allows him to raise and lower
cages like a puppet master.

CONAN
Another feast for my sword.

There is an ominous rumble, and the surface bubbles. Akhoun
lets loose a long peal of laughter.

AKHOUN
No! Another feast for my pet!

THEN A TENTACLE bursts from the water, BLOCKING CONAN’S PATH,
thick as a tree trunk, lined with bony spurs.

The tentacle curls and snaps like the tail of a scorpion.
Conan defends himself with swipes of his sword sending jets
of the creature’s blood, black as ink, across the water.

Ela squeals, swims away, and climbs up into the empty cage.
He slams the door shut, trying to shut the tentacle out.

The tip of a tentacle coils around Conan’s arm, but he drives
his sword into its base.

From somewhere deep in the pool comes an agonized rumble and
a squeal of pain. The tentacle retracts.

But then TWO ENRAGED TENTACLES whip out of the water,
replacing the first, attacking the barbarian, and driving him
backwards.

A THIRD TENTACLE shoots out of the water and probes the cage
where Ela is hiding. Ela kicks at it in desperation.

A massive undulating SHAPE rises just under the surface of
the pool. It is ENORMOUS and GROTESQUE, with an ugly mouth
rimmed with teeth the size of sabers: The Dweller.

Conan avoids the mouth and stabs at a tentacle, but then Three
PIT GUARDS enter and stalk Conan around the edge of the pool,
walking over iron rails on its surface.

PIT GUARD #1 is immediately snatched by a tentacle that wraps
around his neck and yanks him high up into the air and down
into its hungry mouth.

Red Blood fills the pool, mixing with black.
88
PIT GUARD #2 and PIT GUARD #3 attack Conan together, but
Conan slays #3, right under Ela Shan’s hanging cage.

Conan eyes Akhoun and lures Pit Guard #2 closer to him. Just
as Pit Guard #2 reaches him, Conan leaps away...

CRASH! Akhoun drops Ela Shan’s cage, misses Conan, and
crushes Pit Guard #2 instead.

Conan rushes at Akhoun and the two clash. Conan allows Akhoun
to land several ugly blows, but as he does so, Conan wraps
the hanging chain around the villain’s neck.

As Ela Shan’s cage is PULLED UNDERWATER by several strong
tentacles, Akhoun is lifted up by his neck, hanged by his own
chains.

TWENTY KHOR KALBA WARRIORS rush into the amphitheater, and
surround the pool, blocking the floor level exits.

Conan swims to Ela’s sinking cage, but Ela is already under the
surface - the cage dragged towards the Dweller’s MOUTH.

Above Conan, tentacles wrap around the dangling Akhoun.

Then a massive SINGLE EYE rises up out of the water like a
glistening, oily DOME.

Standing up on the sinking cage, Conan leaps, raises the
sword like a stake, and drives it into The Dweller’s eye...

With a LOW ROAR and a HIGH WHISTLE The Dweller’s massive arms
CRASH upon the surface and sink into the depths.

As Akhoun and his chains are dragged DOWN with the Dweller,
Conan, who is clinging to Ella’s cage, is pulled UP...

«+. to a mid-level above the grid, where Conan helps Ela
escape through the DAMAGED bars.

INT. KHOR KALBA - TUNNELS ABOVE THE PIT - NIGHT

Conan rushes out of an exit from the mid-level of The Pit,
and he drags the hapless thief along with him.

EXT. KHOR KALBA - NIGHT

Conan pulls himself up out of a crack in the Khor Kalba ruins.

Then he pulls the exhausted Ela Shan up beside him. High up, he
gets a view of the entire fortress.
89

CONAN’S POV

The procession rides out over the peninsula towards the Skull
Cave. They are escorted by the legion of Khalar’s soldiers.

EXT. KHOR KALBA — SKULL CAVE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Khalar leads a procession on horseback into the ancient
Acheronian site. Marique and two acolytes ride closely
behind.

Tamara, bound tightly to the Vitruvian Wheel, is carried by
four ACOLYTES as if it were some nightmarish funeral march.

Behind them the twelve Cave Guards and another twelve
Warriors from the legion, bring up the rear.

Before them is a massive Excavation Site, with scaffolding,
carts and crude tools. Bit and pieces of purple, Acheronian
ruins sprout out of the cave floor like the bones of some
massive fossil.

On the high cave ceiling are openings - the “eyes” of the
skull that we saw from the outside.

The bulk of the Legion of warriors wait outside the cave.

INT. SKULL CAVE - MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Two Acolytes blow RAM’S HORNS in steady rhythm, like a
primitive siren.

They reach a central PLATFORM, on which are more scaffolding
and LONG CHAINS hanging from pulleys. In front of all this is
a sacrificial PIT.

OUTER RING

Along the edges is an OUTER RING where Cave Guards and
Warriors take up positions.

ON THE PLATFORM

Four of the Acolytes carry the ancient Vitruvian Wheel to the
Platform. The other two hold ceremonial torches.

With the pulleys and chains, the wheel is hoisted and
positioned so that two long pins on its outer rim fit into
two stone posts on The Platform. This allows the entire wheel
to tip forwards and backwards.
90

EXT. KHOR KALBA —- COASTLINE CLIFFS - NIGHT

Conan climbs and jumps over jagged rocks toward the skull cave.
Never has he looked more determined. Terrified and gasping for
breath, Ella can barely keep up with him.

INT. SKULL CAVE - ALTAR - NIGHT

The Acolytes CHANT, some low and guttural, some high and
shrill - an eerie, pagan cacophony.

Marique hands Khalar Corin’s Greatsword.

MARIQUE
As a victorious Barbarian sword
once shattered the mask, a
vanquished Barbarian sword shall
revive it.

Khalar takes the Cimmerian Blade, impressed by its balance
and craftsmanship. He is pleased.

Marique bears the MASK OF ACHERON on a RITUAL TRAY.

EXT. SKULL CAVE - NIGHT - INTERCUT

Grasping tangled vines and roots, Conan and Ela Shan drag
themselves up and over the rain-slick rock, arriving above one
of the two massive HOLES in the cave ceiling.

Below, they see the whole, perverse spectacle, with Tamara at
the center of it all, bound to the wheel.

Ella gawks and swallows; he trembles like a wet gerbil.

CONAN
Your debt is paid. Go.

ELA SHAN
I humbly respect your decision.

INT. SKULL CAVE - ALTAR PLATFORM - NIGHT

Two Acolytes tilt the wheel forward so that Tamara faces down.
Khalar raises Corin’s greatsword.

KHALAR ZYM
By lusty Derketo and serpent-headed
Set, by Dagon and Nergal, I seed the
mask with its master’s blood.
91
Every movement in this ritual seems well-practiced and
choreographed, as if each gesture had symbolic meaning.
Khalar cuts Tamara just below her collarbone. She SCREAMS!

BLOOD flows from the wound. Marique holds The Mask beneath
her on a sacred ritual TRAY.

ON TAMARA

Tamara gasps in horror. She watches helplessly as blood runs
down her body into the mask, seeding it.

CAVE ENTRANCE - ON CONAN

SNAP! Cave Guard #1’s head is turned and his neck is broken.
Conan drops the body quietly.

Conan moves swiftly, silently and almost invisibly along the
side of the cave.

THE PLATFORM - ON THE MASK

Fertilized by the blood, the Mask of Acheron comes alive. The
shards of bone swell and squirm like the arms of The Dweller.

ON KHALAR AND MARIQUE

They exchange a look of eager anticipation. They have both
waited a long time for this moment.

With the sword in one hand, Khalar raises the mask with the
other, high above his head before The Pit.

KHALAR ZYM
Ancient Ones, who burn beneath us,
unspeakable are thy names,
Behold and despair, your new
master.

With both excitement and trepidation, Khalar places the mask on
his face. It fuses with his flesh, the tentacles piercing his
forehead, cheeks and neck. He and the mask become one.

ON THE PIT

An eerie glow paints its rim, a low rumble shakes the cave,
as if something in the depths were awakening.

ON KHALAR

The excruciating pain of the piercing shards gives way to
exhilaration as The Mask’s power flows through him.
92

ON TAMARA

She can’t watch. She turns her head, chin to shoulder. But
from her high vantage point, she can see...

CONAN - TAMARA’S POV

Intent and unstoppable, Conan climbs up the rocks from behind
the altar. He quietly cuts Cave Guard #2’s throat.

Then, he looks up and sees TAMARA STARING DOWN AT HIM. He is
dismayed to see her awash in her own blood.

ON TAMARA

Its all she can do to keep from calling out to him. She
shakes her head... GO BACK!

ON CONAN

But he does not stop. He comes closer and CLOSER, listening
to Khalar’s incantation to his dead wife.

THE PIT

KHALAR ZYM (CONT’D)
Maliva, my queen, hear my call...

But Khalar is interupted...
BEHIND THE WHEEL - ON CONAN

Bolting from his hiding place, Conan LEAPS and SWINGS his
sword in a mighty arc.

At the last second, Khalar ducks, and RAISES CORIN’S SWORD to
block him...

Conan’s sword GLANCES THE EDGE OF THE MASK, chipping it,
causing bright sparks and a resounding CLANG as the metal
hits bone.

Reeling, Khalar falls backwards to the ground.

As the mask is hit, the Pit rumbles with energy, causing
TREMORS across the excavation site.

The Platform CRACKS and the stone posts holding The Wheel
crumble. Conan is knocked off his feet.

DOZENS of Warriors and Guards rushing to the altar are swallowed
into the trembling, crumbling Pit.
93

INSIDE THE PIT
The men tumble helplessly into a fiery abyss.
ON THE PLATFORM

The SCAFFOLDING COLLAPSES, crushing Cave Guard #3 and #4
under its weight, and dangling long chains into The Pit.

ON THE PLATFORM

The WHEEL FALLS from its chassis, with Tamara still attached
to it. It tips forward and DROPS INTO THE PIT.

INSIDE THE PIT

After falling ten feet into the shaft, The Wheel gets STUCK
as its two PINS catch on the walls.

ON TAMARA - UNDER THE WHEEL

Bound to The Wheel, Tamara SCREAMS and pulls at the chains.
Wide eyed, Tamara gawks down into a yawning abyss. The sides
of The Pit open up into a wide crevice filled with purple-
tinged, ACHERONIAN RUINS.

Below that is a fiery, bottomless VORTEX.

SKULL CAVE - ABOVE THE PIT - ON CONAN

Conan hops to his feet, looks down to see Tamara on the
wheel, and HE JUMPS DOWN...

INSIDE THE PIT - ON THE WHEEL

Conan lands on the wheel with startling balance. He reaches
down and breaks one of the manacles with the hilt of his
sword. Tamara’s wrist pulls free.

SKULL CAVE - ABOVE THE PIT - ON KHALAR

He scrambles to his feet, looks into the Pit, and sees Conan
breaking Tamara’s legs free.

He calls out to Marique.

KHALAR ZYM
Don’t let her escape!

Then, Corin’s sword in hand, he JUMPS DOWN...
94

INSIDE THE PIT - ON THE WHEEL

Khalar lands on the wheel and nearly slips and falls. The
wheel teeters right and left under his feet like a see-saw.

SKULL CAVE - ON MARIQUE

Pulling out a DAGGER, Marique rushes away from The Platform
to an outcropping of ruins, leading down...

ON TAMARA - UNDER THE WHEEL

She hangs upside down like an acrobat as the men fight above
her. She pulls her other wrist away from the wheel, but it is
still bound to a long, loose chain.

She climbs off, scrambling down the ravine walls to...

INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - BALCONY - INTERCUT

Tamara claws desperately at the sides of the rocky crevice,
and slides to the Stone Balcony.

Around her are the bizarre Acheronian Ruins - an entire
subterranean city. Stairways extend in all directions, some
sideways or upside down, all leading through A MAZE of
archways and columns.

Below her, flaming magma flows through the ruins in canals
and pours into the Vortex.

Tamara doesn’t see the dark figure rushing towards her from
behind out of The Maze.

She stares up at the men fighting. She has no weapon, and no
way to climb back up to help.

CONAN
(from above)
Find a way out!

Reluctantly, Tamara rushes away into The Maze, dragging the
long chain with her.

INT. INSIDE THE PIT - ON THE WHEEL - INTERCUT

Khalar and Conan clash. Every thrust and parry of their
weapons causes the wheel to tip precipitously in one

direction and then another.

When Khalar attacks, Conan shifts his weight on the wheel,
making the masked warlord stumble to regain his footing.
95

INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - THE MAZE - INTERCUT

Tamara runs over stairways, under archways, and around
columns, but the labyrinth is disorienting, and she doesn’t
see the dark figure rushing towards her from behind...

MARIQUE GRABS TAMARA, but she resists capture.

Tamara throws her elbow into Marique’s gut, driving the witch
backwards. She slams her fist against Marique’s jaw, snapping
Marique’s head to one side.

Frustrated, Marique steps back and brandishes her dagger.

MARIQUE
Kneel down!

Tamara doesn’t kneel. She twirls the long chain still attached
to her wrist and faces off with the witch. Marique raises the
dagger, and Tamara swings the chain...

...wraps it around Marique’s wrist, and YANKS THE DAGGER OUT
OF MARIQUE’S HAND. The blade clatters away.

Marique lunges for Tamara, her needle-fingers extended, and
grabs Tamara by the hair.

INT. THE PIT - KHALAR AND CONAN - INTERCUT

Khalar lunges and misses, slipping on the wheel, and his mask
writhes in frustration.

CONAN
You had your chance Khalar, and you
won’t get another.
(beat)
Won’t your dead queen be ashamed?

With an explosion of fury, Khalar lunges at Conan... and
KHALAR LOSES HIS BALANCE.

Khalar slips, stumbles and KICKS the pin stuck in the side of
the ravine. THE PIN SNAPS OFF!

As the pin in the wheel breaks free, the “floor” falls out from
beneath their feet.

The Wheel falls, bouncing off the crevice walls. Conan and
Khalar fall, scrambling desperately to the sides of the
ravine, into plumes of dust.
96

INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - THE VORTEX BELOW - CONTINUOUS

The wheel crashes off the balcony, flips and plummets,, and
then disappears into The Vortex.

It’s only by watching the wheel fall that we get a sense for
just how breathtakingly deep the abyss really is.
INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - BALCONY - CONTINOUS

Conan and Khalar tumble down to the balcony. Panther-like,
Conan lands on his feet.

By contrast Khalar LANDS HARD on the stone floor, and HE
STUMBLES. Conan swings and Khalar ducks the blade...

CRACK! The tip of Conan’s sword clips the mask, and once
again, when the mask is hit, TREMORS shake the ruins.

Khalar FALLS TO THE EDGE of the balcony. As when he fell at
the Shahpur Outpost, HE IS VULNERABLE.

But just as Conan raises his sword and is about to spring across
the balcony to where Khalar has fallen...

.-. CONAN HEARS TAMARA SCREAM!

Locking eyes with Khalar, Conan hesitates - another chance
for vengeance hanging on his decision.

The villain smiles.

Then Conan DARTS INTO THE MAZE to save the woman he loves.

INT. ACHERONIAN RUINS - ON TAMARA AND MARIQUE - CONT.

As the women fight, more tremors shake the ruins. Lava
bubbles and spills over ancient timbers, which burst into
high flames.

Marique drives her knee against Tamara’s chest pinning her to
the ground. But, Tamara STILL won’t submit.

TAMARA
How will it feel when your father
casts you aside?

Marique flashes with anger and threatens Tamara with her long
needle fingers, holding them above Tamara’s face.
97

TAMARA
You are nothing to him. He only
cares for her.

Marique HISSES, enraged beyond all reason, but as she plunges
five finger-needles towards Tamara’s eyes...

Marique finds her thrust BLOCKED, and her needles SNAP
against the flat end of a hard Cimmerian blade!

Conan whips the sharp blade back, and he SLICES OFF MARIQUE’S
FINGERS!

Marique SCREAMS and clutches her mutilated hand. She's
delirious with fury.

Tamara grits her teeth...

TAMARA
Burn like your mother, witch.

Tamara KICKS MARIQUE into the burning timber below...
ON MARIQUE - AS SHE FALLS

She flails and claws at the air, and she is IMPALED on a
jagged, burning timber. Her skin bursts into flames.

ON KHALAR

He enters the maze, and just as he once watched Maliva, he
watches Marique as she is consumed by the fire.

INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - THE MAZE - NIGHT

Darting in one direction and then another, Tamara and Conan
flee DEEPER into the labyrinth.

There are more rumbles from below and PILLARS TIP and CRASH
around them. They narrowly avoid getting crushed.
INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - THE MAZE - CONTINOUS

Conan doubles back and tries a different direction, around
the perimeter but HE IS CUT OFF BY KHALAR.

Tamara rushes back behind Conan, and the two magnificent
warriors clash.

It is the most spectacular fight we have seen in the film. Conan
swings his blade with all his father’s balance and skill.
98
But, empowered by the mask and with room to maneuver, Khalar
fights with phenomenal strength.
As he wields Corin’s greatsword, Khalar’s shear speed and
dexterity are breathtaking. He seems invincible, and Conan now
looks overmatched. He’s driven back...
«+. Or perhaps leading his opponent forward as...
...another RUMBLE shakes the ruins and another ARCHWAY CRUMBLES
AND FALLS. Conan leaps away just in time, but Khalar is
seemingly buried in rubble.

INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - ANCIENT BRIDGE

Conan and Tamara flee out onto a thin wooden BRIDGE that
spans the crevice, and below it is the fiery vortex.

The bridge is made of flat rotting panels, suspended by
ancient chains and propped up by cracked girders.

Conan crosses quickly to the other side, but behind him, as
Tamara runs to the center of the bridge, she stumbles, the
panels crack and splinter beneath her feet...
...and she FALLS THROUGH.

CONAN

(gasping)
Tamara.

The chain trails after her into the hole...
ON TAMARA

Tamara plummets...

...and then she is YANKED to a full stop. She dangles under
the bridge by her manacled wrist.

ON CONAN

He clutches the end of the chain and he is nearly pulled into
the hole himself...

...but he stops her fall.

And then, the barbarian looks up to see, emerging out of clouds
of dust and falling rubble...
99

KHALAR ZYM

Arms raised, he steps out upon the bridge and calls out the
final verse, completing the ritual.

KHALAR ZYM
Beside me none are equal,
Beneath me all must submit,
Before me all rivals will be
sacrificed!!
(beat)
Maliva, I summon you here!

ON THE RUINS

As if responding to his words, they rattle and hum.

ON THE BRIDGE

A fierce wind rises from the depths. Around them millions of
glowing embers stream up in swarms and float slowly down like
fiery confetti.

UNDER THE BRIDGE - ON TAMARA

Her eyes flicker to pitch black, but as she screams and
shakes her head in defiance, they flicker back to blue.

INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - ANCIENT BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

The whole bridge sways and buckles under their weight. Khalar
strides towards Conan in triumph.

KHALAR
Once again, the little Cimmerian
boy is caught holding a chain.

TAMARA
Drop me!

Conan looks back from Tamara beneath him to Khalar across
from him. With one hand on the chain and the other holding
his sword he can neither fight nor pull her up.

ON TAMARA

Waves of heat sizzle her skin. The hem of her clothing is
starting to light aflame. Tamara’s eyes flicker black.

TAMARA
Let GO of me, CONAN!
100

ON CONAN AND KHALAR

KHALAR ZYM
No. Kneel to me, and she will live.

TAMARA
His witch possesses me! I can’t
fight her... DROP THE CHAIN!
Khalar’s voice is as silky and convincing as a serpent.
KHALAR ZYM
And let another die in your place
like your father?

Conan cannot strike. He cannot let go. His fully extended arm
shakes from the torque and strain. He can’t win...

And so, Conan kneels.

Khalar smiles, knowing full well the barbarian would never let
go of the chain.

ON TAMARA

Eyes jet black , Maliva has overcome her. Around her BLACK ASHES
and GLOWING EMBERS swirl and undulate like a swarm of insects.
Scalding WIND whips her hair.

She crawls up the chain towards Conan...

ON CONAN AND KHALAR

Conan drives his sword point-first into the wooden panel. But
just as Khalar steps forward to take the chain...

KHALAR ZYM
I warned him that I would one day be a
god.

CONAN

And my father warned you...

Conan calmly pulls back his blade stuck in the panel. Just
like Corin’s blade in the ice, it works like a lever,
CRACKING THE WOOD UNDER KHALAR’S FEET.

Khalar FALLS THROUGH, extending his arms to clutch the
splintering wood at his sides to keep from falling through to
the abyss. He FUMBLES CORIN’S SWORD.

SLOW MOTION: Corin’s Sword shoots into the air, tumbling and
spinning, until...
101

.»+-Conan grabs the hilt!

CONAN
God or not...

Conan swings Corin’s sword ONCE, and SHATTERS KHALAR’S MASK.

CONAN
++. You will fall.

And swings TWICE, back the other way and BEHEADS HIM!
CLOSE ON KHALAR’S HEAD - FOLLOWING IT AS IT FALLS

Mouth still gnashing and eyes still rolling in shock and
rage, Khalar’s head tumbles into the vortex.

As each shard of the mask falls into the vortex...
ON TAMARA - INTERCUT

As Conan pulls Tamara up, Maliva’s spirit dissipates. Her
eyes turn back to blue.

Conan scoops her up to her feet. She lost a lot of blood, but
she is still alive. As Conan is about to kiss her...

The vortex rumbles. The bridge buckles and shakes. Great
fissures appear in the ruins. Boulders fall from above.

INT. ACHERONIAN RUINS - VARIOUS LEVELS - NIGHT

The ancient city collapses and the fissures open wide and
split the ravine. Staircases, columns and archways fall into
the abyss.

INT. SKULL CAVE - THE PLATFORM - NIGHT

As Tamara and Conan escape out of the same outcropping of
pillars that Marique entered earlier, The Platform is

consumed. The ravine closes. The Pit is shut.

The entire cave is collapsing around them.

EXT. SKULL CAVE - NIGHT
Conan and Tamara rush out of the cave.
The Skull face of the cave implodes in a final dramatic

quake. The Warriors from Khalar’s legion, those who are not
swallowed and buried in the rubble, scatter and flee.
102

The Acheronian ruins are buried.

On the rocky shore there are two abandoned HORSES from the
procession. The sun rises over the water.

MOMENTS LATER - AT THE SHORELINE
Both mounted on the horses, Tamara looks to Conan.

TAMARA
And now?

Conan extends his father’s sword and watches the sunlight
gleam across the steel.

CONAN
We think of life. The dead are
dead, and what has passed is done.

Conan, black-haired, sullen-eyed, his father’s sword in hand,
leads her towards a fiery sunrise and a darkened sea.

FADE TO BLACK

ALTERNATE ENDING:

EXT. CAVE - DAWN

Conan carries Tamara - bloody, pale and weak - out of the
cave. He puts her limp body down on the sand.

Blood runs from her mouth. Her body shivers in pain

CONAN
What is it?

Conan sees THE WOUND that Marique gave her in the fight.

TAMARA
Poison.

Conan realizes she is dying, and he looks stricken. With the
last of her strength she smiles and whispers to him.

TAMARA (CONT’D)
Grieve not my death, Conan. Think
of life.

She rises up with bloody lips and like his mother, Fialla,
kisses him so that he can taste her blood.

Tamara dies in Conan’s arms.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Conan caries Tamara like a groom carrying his bride through a
threshold, but he carries her not to the wedding bed...

... but to a small funeral pyre of beachwood.
Conan lays Tamara’s body atop it.

Conan lights the pyre. Flames glimmer in his eyes. The air
fills with embers. Conan steps away.

As the fire burns behind him, his father's sword in hand,
Conan walks alone towards a darkened sea.

RESHOOTS

EXT. PITCH BLACK —- NIGHT

NARRATOR
Between the years when the oceans
drank Atlantis and the rise of the
Sons of Aryas...

The sky shimmers with a cascade of STARS.

NARRATOR
...there was an Age undreamed of,
when shining kingdoms lay spread
across the world like blue mantles
beneath the stars.

We TILT DOWN past the milky way to...

EXT. ACHERONIAN TEMPLES - CONTINUOUS

A WIDE SHOT [Matte painting] of Acheron, the dark landscape
and colossal edifice built into cliffs by the sea.

NARRATOR
First came the dark empire of
Acheron, where cruel necromancers
sought secrets of resurrection.

{As Shot] A priest raises The Mask of Acheron.

NARRATOR
They crafted A MASK from the bones
of kings...

{As Shot] A pureblood daughter is bound to the Wheel.

NARRATOR
...and sacrificed their daughters
to baleful gods.

CLOSE ON THE MASK. The victim’s flesh is CUT, her blood flows
onto The Mask. [This will mirror the climax]

{As Shot] the priest lowers the mask and puts it on his face.

NARRATOR
The mask summoned spirits of
unspeakable evil, giving them power
no mortal men should hold.

CLOSE ON THE WHEEL - THE GIRL’S FACE

The girl screams, as black embers swirl around her, and her
face becomes POSSESSED by some loathsome demon. [This will
mirror Tamara’s possession by Maliva in the climax. ]

NARRATOR
Soon rivers ran red with blood, and
cities burst in flame. Acheron
enslaved the civilized world.

IMAGES OF APOCALYPSE

A landscape boils with explosions of fire and waves of blood.
SCENES OF WARFARE

Barbarian hordes swarm Acheron. A fierce battle rages.

NARRATOR
Only the barbarian tribes were left
to rise up against them.

CLOSE ON The Mask CLEAVED by a barbarian sword.

NARRATOR
The Mask was shattered.. and Acheron
fell.

CLOSE ON the shards as they are separated, divided, and
hidden among the tribes.

NARRATOR
Each tribe kept a single shard, so
that no man might attempt to join
them back together, and drive the
world again into madness and ruin.

The final shard hidden in a GOLDEN BOX [the one we will
reshoot in Corin’s forge. ]

NARRATOR
The pieces remained hidden,
scattered across the land for three
thousand years.

INT. WOMB - DAY

DARKNESS again, and SILENCE. Then, the sound of a HEARTBEAT
heard from the womb.

So rose the Hyborian Age, both

TILT DOWN to the immaculate crown of an UNBORN BABY, eyes
closed, floating at peace within the warm glow of the womb.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
.+..and so came a child born of
battle.

SSSKKTTTCH! A flash of steel as a BLADE PIERCES THE WOMB, not
an inch from the child. As the sword is pulled free we MOVE
WITH IT, out into the MADNESS OF BATTLE.

YOUNG CONAN/ADULT CONAN TRANSITION

EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DUSK [AS SHOT]

Looking down, young Conan sees a Cimmerian sword. Howling
with rage he raises the blade in the air.

Camera BOOMS UP with the sword...

FADE OUT.

(OPTIONAL NARRATION ]

NARRATOR
For twelve long years Conan, son of
Corin, wandered the ragged edges of
the world.

But, the nameless man who killed
his father remained in shadow.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Their god is Crom, who rules over a
sunless place of everlasting mist,
the land of the dead.

A mighty hand digs into the sand past skull and bone, and
lifts dust into the wind.

The dust falls through his fingers like sand in an hourglass.

NARRATOR
Conan left Cimmeria and wandered
the edges of the world, slaying,
thieving, surviving , storming the
high walls of Venarium and prowling
the dark seas among pirates.

CAMERA MOVES around the strong, scarred arm revealing the
face of the mature CONAN. On bent knee, Conan looks into the
dust as if he can see something through it.

He rises, brushing sand from his hands and looks at his palm.

CLOSE ON HIS PALM

We see the burn scars from the hot chains he once held to
support his father in the forge. His hand balls into a fist.

NARRATOR
But the nameless man who scarred
his hands remained in shadow.

EXT. ZINGARAN COASTLINE - DAY

{We begin with the “Zingaran Slave Colony” matte, and shots
of the slaves being whipped and abused by their masters]

CONAN ENTRANCE SHOT:
{If this were a commercial, this would be our product shot]
We PAN up the edge of a broad sword, over the massive fist
that grips the hilt, over the powerful muscles of the arms to
the chiseled chest, and we PULL BACK to REVEAL the adult
Conan, staring down at the slavers from atop a horse.
Artus enters frame and looks up at the barbarian.

No man should live in chains.

Conan raises his sword high in the air, giving the signal to
the other pirates.

We cut to the existing shot of Conan with sword raised and
Messantia in the background [... and the rocks begin to
roll.]
INT. MESSANTIA - ALEHOUSE - NIGHT
Conan squints through haze at THE CAPTAIN, catching only
glimpses through the mob. He’s familiar: The distinctive way
he rolls his neck. The mask that covers his nose. [As Shot]
A hush falls over the rowdy crowd.

SLAVE GIRLS (0.C.)

(gasping)
The captain of the guard!

{Then after Ela and Conan fight the surly guards]
Conan offers his wrist in surrender. As the guard hesitates
to shackle him...

CONAN

Take me to your captain, or die
where you stand.

SAND WARRIORS

EXT. SHAHPUR OUTPOST - DAY

From afar the crumbling stone structure seems abandoned and
lifeless. A wisp of smoke rises from behind the walls.

EXT. SHAHPUR OUTPOST - COURTYARD - DAY

{As shot] The Shahpur outpost was once a working fortress,
and rickety scaffolding, ladders and platforms remain. On the
ground sit loading docks, old farm and construction
equipment. A few torches burn on the walls.

Conan stands and waits. Behind him Tamara stands BOUND TO A
POST like a prisoner.

Conan studies his surroundings. He looks right and sees...
One of several TORCHES, burning.

Conan looks left and sees...

POOLS OF TAR leaking from BARRELS.

«+. [Then at the end of the fight sequence]

ON TAMARA

She hides behind fallen debris, and she watches...

KHALAR AND CONAN [As shot]

Khalar delivers a KICK to Conan’s chest, and he spins in slow
motion and falls hard to the ground.

Khalar moves toward Conan. Khalar is ready for the kill.

ON CONAN

Poisoned and weak, Conan locks eyes with Tamara, and NODS...
ON TAMARA

She dashes from her hiding place, grabs the BURNING TORCH,
and tosses it to him...

ON CONAN

He catches it and HURLS the torch at the POOL OF OILY TAR.
ON THE BARRELS

The tar IGNITES and flames rush towards the barrels!

ON CONAN AND TAMARA

Tamara helps Conan to his feet.

CONAN
Run!

As they bolt...
WIDER ON THE OUTPOST [AS SHOT]

KABOOM!!! The barrels explode into flames. Khalar dives for
cover.
ON CONAN AND TAMARA [AS SHOT]

Conan and Tamara scramble up scaffolding to the top of the
rear outpost wall.

ATOP THE WALL [AS SHOT]

Tamara stops at the edge - a vertiginous drop to cliffs and a
raging sea. Tamara hesitates...

ON ARTUS - IN THE BOAT

ARTUS
By Mitra... JUMP!

WIDE ON THE CLIFFS [as shot]

Conan and Tamara LEAP off the wall, plummeting down toward
the harbor below.

ON CONAN AND TAMARA
They land in the ocean water and sink...
ON THE OCEAN SURFACE

Like a life guard, Tamara clutches a semi-conscious Conan and
drags him across the ocean towards the boat.

CLIMAX ON THE BRIDGE

INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - ANCIENT BRIDGE

Conan and Tamara flee out onto a thin wooden BRIDGE that
spans the crevice, and below it is the fiery vortex.

The bridge is made of flat rotting panels, suspended by
ancient chains and propped up by cracked girders.

KHALAR ZYM (0.C.)
Barbarian!

As they hesitate, turning back at the sound of Khalar’s
voice, the panels splinter beneath Tamara’s feet...

...and she FALLS THROUGH.
The chain trails after her into the hole...
ON TAMARA

Tamara plummets...
ON CONAN

«+. Conan lunges for the chain.

ON TAMARA

...She is YANKED to a full stop. She dangles under the bridge
by her manacled wrist. She looks down in terror at the
yawning abyss.

ON CONAN

He clutches the end of the chain and he is nearly pulled into
the hole himself...

.-.but with his free hand he drives Corin’s sword into the
wood, anchoring himself. It takes all his strength to hold
on.

But then, the barbarian looks up to see, emerging out of
clouds of dust and falling rubble...

KHALAR ZYM

Arms raised, he steps out upon the bridge and calls out the
final verse, completing the ritual.

KHALAR ZYM
Maliva, I summon you here!

ON THE RUINS
As if responding to his words, the ruins rattle and hum.
ON THE BRIDGE
A fierce wind rises from the depths. Around them millions of
glowing embers stream up in swarms and float slowly down like
fiery confetti.
UNDER THE BRIDGE - ON TAMARA
Her eyes flicker and roll back as Maliva’s spirit washes over
her. But she RESISTS. She screams and shakes her head in
defiance. Her eyes return to normal.
INT. RUINS OF ACHERON - ANCIENT BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Khalar strides towards Conan in triumph.

KHALAR

Once again, the little Cimmerian
boy is caught holding a chain.

*
Conan looks down to...

TAMARA

..-dangling beneath him like a spider on a thread. Her body
convulses and twitches as she struggles against the demonic
spirit taking hold of her. It’s getting worse.

TAMARA
His witch possesses me!

ON CONAN AND KHALAR
Calmly, Khalar stands over Conan.
KHALAR ZYM
Boy, there is no shame in kneeling

before me.

With one hand on the chain and the other holding his sword
Conan can neither fight nor pull her up.

 

 

Khalar places his hand on Conan’s hand the grips the chain.
ON TAMARA

Waves of heat sizzle her skin. The hem of her clothing is
starting to light aflame. Tamara’s eyes roll back, and her
face changes shape as Maliva flows through her.

TAMARA
I can’t fight her. Drop the chain!

ON CONAN AND KHALAR
Khalar’s voice is as silky and convincing as a serpent.
KHALAR ZYM
And let another die in your place
like your father?
TAMARA
LET GO, CONAN! Drop me and KILL
HIM!

Conan cannot strike. He cannot let go. His fully extended arm
shakes from the torque and strain. He can’t win...

Khalar smiles, knowing full well Conan would never let go.
ON TAMARA

Eyes blank, her hairline receding to reveal the witches long
forehead, Maliva has overcome her. She hisses in delight.

 
113
Around her BLACK ASHES and GLOWING EMBERS swirl and undulate
like a swarm of insects. Scalding WIND whips her hair.
She crawls up the chain towards Conan...
ON CONAN AND KHALAR

Conan drives his sword point-first into the wooden panel. But
just as Khalar steps forward to take the chain...

KHALAR ZYM
I warned him that I would one day
be a god.

CONAN

And my father warned you...
Conan pulls back his blade stuck in the panel. Just like
Corin’s blade in the ice, it works like a lever, CRACKING THE
WOOD UNDER KHALAR’S FEET.

CONAN
God or not...

Khalar LOSES HIS BALANCE, extending his arms at his sides to
keep from falling through to the abyss.

CONAN
++. You will fall.

Conan swings Corin’s sword and SHATTERS THE MASK.
The bridges buckles and breaks. KHALAR FALLS.
CLOSE ON KHALAR - FOLLOWING HIM AS HE FALLS

Mouth still gnashing and arms still thrashing in shock and
rage, Khalar tumbles into the vortex.

ON THE MASK
As the shards of the mask fall into the vortex...
ON TAMARA

...-Maliva's spirit dissipates. The spell is broken. Tamara’s
face becomes normal.

ON CONAN

Using both hands he draws the chain up.
ON TAMARA - INTERCUT
As Conan pulls, Tamara reaches up to him...
ON CONAN

Conan grabs her hand and scoops her up through the hole. She
groggy and disoriented, but she is still alive.

As he holds her in his arms, their eyes lock. Just as it
seems as if Conan is about to kiss her...

The vortex rumbles. The bridge buckles and shakes. Great
fissures appear in the ruins. Boulders fall from above.

WIDE ON THE BRIDGE
Conan and Tamara race off the bridge.
MAZE OF PILLARS

Conan and Tamara flee as ruins collapse.

INT. ACHERONIAN RUINS - VARIOUS LEVELS - NIGHT

The ancient city crumbles and the fissures open wide.
Staircases, columns and archways fall into the abyss.

EXT. SKULL CAVE - DAWN
Conan and Tamara ride along the shore away from the cave.

Behind them The Skull face of the cave collapses and implodes
in a final dramatic quake and thunderous boom.

EXT. SHORELINE - DAWN
WIDE ON the beach as they continue to ride across the sand.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HYRKANIA - DAY
Conan slows the horse to a stop.

Tamara dismounts. In the distance is a monastery surrounded
by lush fields and idyllic woods.
TAMARA
So, my master was right, Conan. You
did take me home.

She takes his hand and kisses it, but then she steps back.
She looks up at him, sullen and strong.

TAMARA
Now go... and seek life. I am
content.

With a touch of sadness, Tamara watches Conan ride off.

EXT. ROCKY BLUFF - DAY - FINAL SHOT VERSION #1

Our iconic hero’s exit shot: As the narration begins Conan
rides up the bluff towards us until he fills frame.

For a moment he pauses, iconic, mythic, and bold. He holds
his father’s sword by the hilt.

NARRATOR
Hither came Conan the Cimmerian,
his father’s sword in hand...

Then as the narration continues we PULL BACK.

As we move farther and farther away, Conan get’s smaller and
smaller, until the hero is obscured by swirling mist, and he
fades away like a ghost.

NARRATOR
.+.a thief, a slayer, a son born of
battle, to tread the shadow-guarded
tombs and ride the battle-ravaged
earth where he would one day rise
as King.

EXT. CORIN’S FORGE - DAY - FINAL SHOT VERSION #2

Now all that remains of the Cimmerian village is a circle of
stone hearths, crumbling chimneys, and rusted metal scraps.

We pan over the remains of the forge to THE STONE MOLD, where
Corin’s sword was pored. It still has the shape of a blade.

Conan approaches the stone mold and hearth as if it were a
tombstone, running his finger over the edge.

CLOSE ON THE STONE

On the stone Conan places a single, unbroken RAVEN’S EGG.

Conan crouches on the grounds, holding his father’s sword,
waving and thrusting and sparing, just as he did as a boy.

As the sun sets behind him and the blade flashes, Conan looks
larger than life - a mythic and timeless icon.
