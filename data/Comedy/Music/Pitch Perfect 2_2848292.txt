theme song being sung a cappella by...

INT. KENNEDY CENTER - PRESS BOX 1
Our a cappella commentators, JOHN and GAIL.

JOHN
Excited, Gail?

GAIL
If I weren’t, would I be wearing a
diaper under this dress?

As John speaks, we HEAR a marching band play.

JOHN (V.O.)
Welcome back, a cappella
enthusiasts!

INT. KENNEDY CENTER - STAGE - AUGUST 2014 - NIGHT 2
A MILITARY BAND heads off stage as THE BARDEN BELLAS get set.

JOHN
I’m John Smith and sitting to my
right is Gail Abernathy-McCadden-
Feinberger.

GAIL
(pointing to wedding ring)
This one’s gonna stick, John.

JOHN
Well you saved the Jew for last.

GAIL
(gleefully nodding)
I did, I did.

JOHN
You're listening to Let’s Talk-
appella, the world’s premiere
downloadable a cappella podcast.

GAIL
We are coming to you live from our
nation’s capitol where the Barden
University Bellas are about to rock
the historic Kennedy Center.

The BELLAS: BECA, CHLOE, Lilly, STACIE, CYNTHIA ROSE,
JESSICA, ASHLEY and a small Latina girl, FLORENCIA FUENTES
(FLO). Chloe nods at Beca, who blows the pitch pipe.

BECA
One, two, three, four...

The Bellas SING: Icona Pops’s “We Got the World.”

BECA (CONT'D)
THEY SAY YOU'RE A FREAK WHEN WE'RE
HAVING FUN... (song continues)

This performance reflects a group at the top of its game.
INT. KENNEDY CENTER - PRESS BOX - CONTINUOUS 3

JOHN
These ladies have broken down every
barrier in their path, haven't
they, Gail?

GAIL
So right, John. The first all-
female group to win a national
title. Three-time defending champs.
And now here they are performing
for the President of the United
States on his birthday.

REVEAL: The PRESIDENT and FIRST LADY, who sit in a private
box [STOCK FOOTAGE]. SECRET SERVICE AGENTS stand guard.

JOHN
Wow. What an inspiration to girls
all over the country who are too
ugly to be cheerleaders.

Beca, killing it on stage.
JOHN (0.C.)

There’s Beca Mitchell, leader of
the group.

Flo does some BACKFLIPS across the stage. It’s impressive.

ON STAGE:
good, but

GAIL (0.C.)
International exchange student Flo
Fuentes just earned her green card!

JOHN
She may need to do that flip right
over the fence and back into
Mexico.

GAIL
I think she’s Guatemalan.

JOHN
Oh, none of that matters.

The ladies continue their kickass performance. It’s
a little noisy.

GAIL (0.C.)
There is so much going on on-stage,
I don’t know where to look.

JOHN
Couldn't agree more. Back in my
day, we just sang. Maybe snapped
our fingers if we were feeling
frisky.

INT. KENNEDY CENTER STAGE - CONTINUOUS 6

The mash-up comes to an end, and they sing the last line from
“America the Beautiful.”

BELLAS
FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA!

The ladies TRANSITION TO: Miley Cyrus’s “Wrecking Ball.” From
the rafters descends... FAT AMY! She wears a sparkly leotard
and sits in a harness with billowy white material flowing
from her. She looks like an angel. As she descends:

FAT AMY
I CAME IN LIKE A WRECKING BALL!/I
NEVER HIT SO HARD IN LOVE!...

GAIL (0.C.)
Wow! What a surprise!

JOHN (0.C.)
An overweight girl dangling from
the ceiling. Who hasn't had that
dream?

GAIL
Lots of us!

FAT AMY
.--I CAME IN LIKE A WRECKING BALL!

As the song continues, each Bella grabs on to a piece of
material attached to Fat Amy’s harness. It looks super cool,
like something out of Cirque du Soleil.

As Fat Amy spins thirty feet above the stage,

FAT AMY (CONT'D)
DON'T YOU EVER SAY I JUST WALKED
AWAY/I WILL ALWAYS WANT YOU...

During a move, Fat Amy FLIPS upside down, losing control. As
she tries to correct her position, her leotard rips at the
seam with her back to the audience EXPOSING her BUTT CHEEKS!
The audience gasps! Thrown, the Bellas stop singing. Beca
looks up in shock.

BECA
Goodbye innocence.

BACK ON JOHN AND GAIL, who hold on to each other’s shoulders.

ANGLE ON: A stern-looking President and First Lady.

GAIL (0.C.)
Who is on top of this?!

TECH GUYS frantically hit buttons to try to prevent the
impending situation.

INT. KENNEDY CENTER - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Balloons are RELEASED from the rafters, “Hail to the Chief”
begins playing over the PA. Upstage, an American flag UNFURLS
and a big birthday cake ROLLS out on a cart.

ON STAGE: The harness TURNS Fat Amy very slowly so that she’s
about to face the audience. Her arms are caught up in fabric
and she can't cover her privates!

GAIL (0.C.)
Take her back up already!

JOHN
She's turning. She’s turning --

GAIL
Oh my god, the children! Would
somebody think of the children!

John SLAPS a hysterical Gail across the face. ON STAGE: As
Fat Amy is almost squarely showing her bits to the audience,

FAT AMY
Avert your eyes or take it all in!
You need to make a choice!

GAIL (0.C.)
Not the front! Nobody wants to see
the front!

The harness comes to a stop with Fat Amy FLASHING the
audience with downtown full frontal. ANGLE ON: Reactions of
shocked anticipation from the Bellas, audience members, and
John and Gail.

INT. CREDIT SEQUENCE - MONTAGE 9

A montage of clips featuring several NEWS PERSONALITIES
covering “Muff-gate.” Some clips feature gifs of Fat Amy,
hanging exposed with her downtown pixillated.

LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR
Happy birthday, Mr. President. The
Australian singer who calls herself
“Fat Amy” gave the President a
birthday gift from “down under”
during last night’s celebration
held at the Historic Kennedy
Center.

(turns to co-host)

And if you’re wondering what I mean
by down under, Chip. I’m talking
about her vagina. She showed her
vagina. To the President.

TODAY SHOW HOST
All eyes were on The Barden Bellas --

JAKE TAPPER
Three time defending national
champions, which is a real thing...
apparently.

MSNBC REPORTER
Although authorities have ruled out
terrorism as a motive, The Bellas
claim the mishap was merely an
accident. And Fat Amy issued an
apology--

FAT AMY
(off paper)
I am deeply sorry for the upset
that I have caused. I feel I have
already received punishment
enough... in the form of silk burn.
Exhibit C.

As Fat Amy turns to show her butt burns,

FOX NEWS PUNDIT
It's filth. Women who sing are just
another example of cultural decay
due to loose morals--

JOE SCARBOROUGH

Not wearing underwear seems kind of
intentional, don’t you think?

MORNING JOE CO HOST
Yeah, you either choose to wear
underwear or you don’t wear
underwear.

JOE SCARBOROUGH
That is a decision I make everyday.

JIMMY KIMMEL
You know, until today, I thought
singing a cappella was the most
embarrassing thing you could do.

ROSIE O’DONNELL
(to The View panel)
Usually those girls were on point
but last night they were off point,
off key, and their clothes on the
floor.

ROSIE PEREZ
Yeah, but I’d rather be in that
limo ride home with the real
President and he be like, “That
shit was off the hook!”

It's a new school year. We see a bustling college campus and

our Bellas coming together, heading toward somewhere.

Chloe nervously paces in front of the Bellas.

BECA
Chloe, chill out. It was a mistake.
They’re not gonna burn us for
witchcraft.

CHLOE
No, but right now, the people that
run the I.C.C.A’s are -

in there with the Dean talking
about us, and they think we’re a

CHLOE

What other stuff?
BECA

You know, school, jobs... life.
CHLOE

This group is my life. I’ve
intentionally failed Russian Lit
three times just so I could still
be a Bella!

Chloe drops into her chair.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
This is the worst thing that’s ever
happened to any of us!

Flo pats Chloe’s back, and in her ever-optimistic tone:

FLO
You know, before coming to Barden,
I had diarrhea for seven years.
(pause)
But yes, this is terrible.

FAT AMY
I don’t understand. What’s the big
deal, anyway?

CYNTHIA ROSE
Um, you booshed-out our commander-
in-chief.

STACIE
Yeah, he’s not supposed to see that
stuff because he’s Muslim.

FAT AMY
Stacie, have you learned anything
since you’ve been in college?

An ancient-looking SECRETARY approaches the ladies, comically
slow. Then, very judge-y...

INT. DEAN OF STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

The Bellas stand in two rows as if on trial. Before them, a
stern-looking John and Gail sit behind a desk on either side
of the DEAN.

DEAN
Ladies, you have dragged the good
name of Barden University into the
gutter. And you’ve really upset
these people, whose names I’ve
already forgotten.

JOHN
(sarcastic)
Nice intro, Seacrest.

GAIL
Do you know who we are?

CHLOE
You’re the National Association for
the Advancement of A Cappella
Performers.

JOHN
That's right. And we’re concerned
here at the N-triple A-C-P. Your
little southern exposure in front
of the Commander-In-Chief has
irreparably damaged the entire
institution of a cappella. Funding
has dropped, sponsors are pulling
out, Rashida Jones is denying ever
being a part of it!

GAIL
And the flood of complaints!
(to Fat Amy)
You would not believe the heavy
flow caused by your vagina.

FAT AMY
You’re an adult. You know what you
just said.

JOHN
Unfortunately an example must be
made.

It is the decision of this
governing body that the Bellas are
hereby suspended from ever
participating in competition at the
collegiate level.

A beat of shock as this new information sinks in.

LILLY
Gasp!

JOHN
(leans in, re: Lilly)
Did she say something? Did the
Asian say something?!

John points a fancy pen at Lilly.

JOHN (CONT'D)
‘Cause I will not be mocked!

The Dean swipes the pen from John.

DEAN
Hey, that’s my pen. I got it at
Alcatraz.

GAIL

The terms of your suspension are
laid out in this document. I’m
sorry, but it’s over.

Then:

A concerned Chloe takes the file from Gail. She opens and

reads it.

BECA
Okay, can we be reasonable? Fat Amy
apologized. It was an accident.

GAIL
Was it?

CHLOE
(off document, irked)
You're taking us off our I.C.C.A.

the national anthem at the Puppy
Bowl?

You're being replaced by the

DEAN
And you can’t hold any auditions.
We don’t need your ranks to grow

Beca puts her hand on Chloe’s shoulder to comfort her.

the truth is, you’re just women.
And you all be pregnant soon.

I'm sorry, I feel like I have to be
“on” all the time or people won’t
like me.

DEAN
So this championship is like the
Olympics?

CHLOE
Actually, a cappella competitions
started the year before the first
games in Athens. The discus was
invented because they wanted
something to throw at the singers.

STACIE
(aside to Chloe)
Is that true?

CHLOE
It might be. I’m failing history,
too.

Yeah! Where is that?

CHLOE
No idea! I failed Maps!

FAT AMY

CHLOE

Looks like it’s been dominated by

STACIE
You mean stole our tour.

FAT AMY

Fat Amy picks up one of the letters.

FAT AMY (CONT'D)
But I’m not worried. When we win,

INT. EP RECORDING STUDIO - HALLWAY/BULLPEN - DAY 25

FLASH! Beca, disoriented by a flashbulb, gets her picture
taken.

THE SAME PICTURE is hung around her neck on a big green ID
Badge.

IN QUICK SUCCESSION: She POPS coffee pods into three
different machines lined up on a kitchen counter and hits
three different brew buttons. She grabs a bag of chips and
holds it with her mouth. Then, grabs several coffees.

Beca walks briskly through a super hip office, gold and
platinum records lining the walls. She takes a wrong turn,
corrects herself, and finally lands in a bullpen. She hands
out coffee to HIPSTER EMPLOYEES who don’t even look at her.

A hipster employee, DAX, talks on the phone and SNATCHES the
chips right out of her mouth.

BECA
Thanks. I was having a hard time
breathing. Anything else I --

Dax impatiently WAVES her away. Beca nods “got it.”

Then, SAMMY, 40s, a music producer who is always wearing
designer t-shirts, sunglasses and a ball cap, sweeps in.

SAMMY
Okay, everybody huddle up. Let’s
go! Let’s go! To the table please!

A dozen EMPLOYEES from all over the studio begin crowding
into the bullpen. Following their lead, Beca DRAGS a chair
over. An IN-CHARGE WOMAN smiles and takes it, assuming Beca
brought it for her. Beca awkwardly sits on the floor.

SAMMY (CONT'D)
Come on. Last one in has to help
Frank watch Youtube videos to find
the next Justin Bieber.

PAN OVER to a really young millenial, FRANK.
FRANK

Okay, my people. Check it.

Sammy PUSHES a button on a remote. On a projection screen,
CALVIN “SNOOP LION” BROADUS, in a three-piece suit, stands at
a candlelit gathering, surrounded by MULTI-CULTURAL CHILDREN.

SAMMY (CONT'D)
That is --

The screen stops working. A frustrated Sammy turns to Dax.

SAMMY (CONT'D)
Dax, did you call the tech guy?

DAX
Yeah I talked to him.

SAMMY
(shakes head)
Do you understand that everything
else in my life works?

DAX
Uh huh.

SAMMY
So I just need everything in here
to work, too.

DAX

He said he was gonna call me back --
SAMMY

Oh my god.
DAX

You want me to call him now?
SAMMY

Don’t... you do it now.

That is the lion himself, legendary
Snoop D-O-Double-G singing “White
Christmas” at a tree lighting
ceremony in Moscow.

They all react, “nice.”

SAM
He was so moved by the power of
music to unite the world or some
shit that now he wants to drop a
cool Christmas album, put his spin
on the classics. And because I
sleep on a bed of Grammys, he’s
hired me to produce it.

There’s a murmur of excitement.

DAX
But Snoop Dogg already put out a
Christmas album --

SAMMY

If you’d listened to it like I did --
stranded in the air with T.I. ona
golden hang glider, then you would
have known that it wasn’t the
classics. I’ve had to listen to that
album on two different occasions...
Hang glider with T.I. and also ona
rocket ship that Eminem built. It
doesn’t go anywhere, but he’s got
dreams for it, okay? So I need you to
close your mouth.

(then, re: screen)
Herein lies the problem. Last I
checked there are over a million
Christmas albums -- with the same
ten damn songs on them. So we need
all hands on deck to come up with
ideas on how to make this one stand
out. You got me? Fire when ready.

The Employees all look at each other. After a beat,

laid over the new Treble pledges.

Ooh! And we’re down to two. I have

INT. MANSION - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 49
The Bellas and DSM step up to oppose each other.

SIR WILLUPS
The last category is...
(off wall)
“90'S HIP HOP JAMZ!" Hit it!

He points to Kommissar. She sings Montell Jordan's “This is
How We Do It.”

KOMMISSAR
THIS IS HOW WE DO IT/I'M KINDA
BUZZED AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE (THIS

Sir Willups points to Cynthia Rose. She jumps in with Lauren
Hill’s “Doo Wop (That Thing)”

CYNTHIA ROSE
GIRLS YOU KNOW YOU'D BETTER, WATCH
OUT/SOME GUYS, SOME GUYS ARE ONLY
ABOUT/THAT THING, THAT THING, THAT

Sir Willups points to Pieter. It’s getting more rapid and

more rapid as the round progresses. Pieter sings Bel Biv
Devoe’s “Poison” directly at Fat Amy.

ANGLE ON: A nervous Emily, hiding behind Cynthia Rose. Fat
Amy gets the point. She jumps in with “Scenario” by Tribe
Called Quest.

FAT AMY
HERE WE GO, YO/HERE WE GO, YO/ SO
WHAT’S SO WHAT’S SO WHAT’S THE
SCENARIO?

Sir Willups likes the rivalry and points to Pieter again:
“Insane In The Brain” by Cypress Hill.

PIETER
INSANE IN DA MEMBRANE
INSANE IN DA BRAIN!
INSANE IN DA MEMBRANE

Beca is front and center, ready to go but Sir Willups fakes
the whole room out by pointing to Emily. Taken by surprise,
she instinctively sings the first song in her head:
“Flashlight” which she adjusts to meet the beat.

EMILY
I GOT ALL I NEED/WHEN I GOT YOU AND
I/'CAUSE I LOOK AROUND ME/AND SEE A
SWEET LIFE/I’'M STUCK IN THE
DARK/BUT YOU'RE MY FLASHLIGHT...

People react, confused. Beca, liking what she’s hearing,
steps up and tries to improvise back up.

EMILY (CONT'D)
YOU'RE MY FLASHLIGHT/YOU’RE GETTING
ME GETTING ME THROUGH THE NIGHT.

Lilly, not knowing the song, drops the beat. The crowd starts
to BOO. Emily and Beca start to trail off.

SIR WILLUPS
I’m sorry. What 90s hip hop jam is
that again?
They look to Emily for the answer.
EMILY

More like a 21st century jam. I

Jason spits in Emily’s direction. Beca guards her.

SIR WILLUPS

EMILY
Emily.

SIR WILLUPS
Emily. I hate you.

In light of this embarrassing and

walk away.

BECA

Did you really write that?

Emily nods. Chloe addresses Emily.

CHLOE
You shouldn’t have done that,
Emily. Now Das Sound Machine thinks
they have the drop on us.

EMILY
Sorry, I panicked. I understand if
you want me to crawl under a rock

BECA
Hey, we don’t want that --

Hey. We don’t want that.

Chloe just shakes her head, disappointed. Jesse walks up.

JESSE
Becs, let’s go meet the Green Bay
Packers.

BECA

Okay, okay.

As the party continues and the Bellas disperse, Bumper
approaches Fat Amy.

BUMPER

FAT AMY

She winks again.

BUMPER
There it is. You did it again. I

I’1l meet you later, Bumper. God,

Ohhhhhh! Now I getcha.

I will see you. Later tonight.

Bumper winks big at Fat Amy.
FAT AMY

Well now I’m confused. Are we
meeting or not?

 

This exchange goes on for ten lifetimes. As the mosh pit and
singing continue, we CUT TO...

EXT. TREBLE HOUSE - EVENING - DECEMBER

Jesse’s car sits in the Treble driveway, filled for his cross
country trip. Christmas decorations adorn the house. Jesse

Beca PULLS a gift from her bag and hands it to Jesse who
OPENS it. REVEAL: It’s the movie “E.T.”

BECA (CONT’D)
You’1l like it. It’s about a
strange, awkward outsider who
leaves home and tries to fit in--

JESSE
(chuckle)
Beca, I’ve seen “E.T.”

BECA
You have? It came out like a
hundred years before we were born.
How do you know this stuff?

JESSE
Thank you. I love it. We’1ll watch
it together.

BECA

JESSE
Still not a movie person.

BECA
Well, take care of yourself.

JESSE
Take care of myself? What are you,

Look, I’m not upset you’re pursuing
your dream. I think that’s great.
But it means you’re moving to the
other side of the country. While I
stay here to do my thing. And...
We're young. We’re growing apart.
It’s happening.

JESSE
Uh-uh. It’s not going to happen. A
couple of time zones could never
come between us. So nice try. We’ll
be together again. I promise.
Jesse picks up his bags to go. Then:
BECA
When? When will we be together
again?
Jesse goes to answer but nothing comes to mind. Then, softly:

JESSE
We'll figure it out. I gotta go.

Jesse pulls Beca in for one last kiss and gets in his car. As
Beca watches Jesse pull away,

BECA

Take care of yourself.
Beca makes her way across the yard to the Bella house.

SAMMY

Look, you have a great ear. You

excited to hear what else you had.
But what you gave me was just more
mash ups.

BECA
Well that’s sorta what I do.

SAMMY
Listen, Reggie --

BECA
Beca. That happens a lot though.
You'd be surprised.

SAMMY
Here’s the thing. Any kid with ears

do that. And that’s fine if you
want a career deejaying raves in
the desert. But if you want to
write “music producer” on your tax
forms someday, then you need an

Show me what you have. Right now,

Sammy walks off. Beca reacts, “holy shit.”

INT. BELLA HOUSE - BECA AND FAT AMY’S ROOM - 5 A.M. 52

A frustrated Beca lays on her bed with her computer in her
lap. ANGLE ON: The screen, her music apps register no
activity. She has the piano app open and just hits middle C
over and over. Fed up, Beca makes a call that goes straight
to voicemail.

BECA (INTO PHONE)
Hey it’s me. You probably won't be
able to even hear this message
because as it turns out, I have
nothing to say. Um, that’s music

You're definitely sleeping right

Beca focuses back on her computer. Fat Amy switches t-shirts.

FAT AMY (CONT'D)
Why are you up so late anyways?

BECA
I’m trying to figure something out.

FAT AMY
Well if you’re working on our set,
might I humbly suggest you leave
time for me to do some light break
dancing?

Fat Amy “pop and locks” but is barely moving.
FAT AMY (CONT'D)
See, the audience has to figure out
when I’m moving...
Fat Amy doesn’t move at all. Then, a tiny move of her pinky.
FAT AMY (CONT'D)

great mental discipline on my part.

Fat Amy goes into her closet.

BECA
I’m not working on the set... I’m--

Fat Amy gets up and crosses over to Beca.

FAT AMY

FAT AMY
No. I don’t -- I don’t want to do

This hits Bumper hard. Choking back emotions,

BUMPER

That’s cool. Yeah, stupid idea

AUBREY

Aubrey turns back.

A creaking sound is heard nearby.

CYNTHIA ROSE
What’s that sou--?

Just then, a tree falls, CRUSHING the second tent. The Bellas
react, speechless. Aubrey plays it cool, “surprised.”

AUBREY
Well, look at that. I guess you’re
doubling up. Don’t go shoulder-to-

Aubrey walks over to the four wheeler where Leslie is putting

of beans as they wave good-bye.

Nope. Side of the tent it is.
