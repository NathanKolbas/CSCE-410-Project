INT. FAIRBURN BUILDING. RECEPTION. DAY,

An old-fashioned office entrance with RECEPTIONIST also
working the switchboard. BUFFERY, a client, enters
followed closely by MICHAEL RIMMER who contrives to
give the impression they are together, RIMMER carries
a clipboard and stopwatch. A board says 'FAIRBURN
OPINION POLLS', "FAIRBURN MANAGEMENT’, etc.

BUFFERY
(politely)
I'd like to see the Managing Director
please. Buffery's the name.

RECEPTIONIST
Just one moment.
(she presses intercom. button)
Mr. Ferret?

FERRET'S VOICE
(over intercom.)
With cream please.

RECEPTIONIST
No, Mr. Ferret ...

FERRET'S VOICE
But I always have cream, and sugar.

RECEPTIONIST
There's a Mr. Buffery to see you.

FERRET'S VOICE
Oh, send him up please.

RECEPTIONIST
(to BUFFERY)
Third floor please.
(to RIMMER)
Yes?

RIMMER
Yes.

RIMMER walks away with BUFFERY.
INT. STAIRCASE. DAY.

RIMMER follows, BUFFERY and times his ascent with a stop-
watch. An embarrassing silence for BUFFERY as they
continue up the stairs.

INT. CORRIDOR. DAY,

RIMMER follows BUFFERY along corridor and enters
FERRET's office behind him. FERRET, the Managing
Director, is a struggling member of the respectable
middle class.

INT, OFFICE. DAY.

TANYA who is FERRET's very sexy secretary is seated at
desk in same office.

BUFFERY
Mr, Ferret?

FERRET
Yes.

FERRET smiles, puts out his hand. BUFFERY punches
FERRET in the face,knocking him back off his chair,
turns to leave the office and stops at the door.

BUFFERY
Just popped in to cancel our contract.

BUFFERY exits,

RIMMER
(smiling)
Good morning, Mr. Ferret.

Good morning ... You alright?

RIMMER
Rimmer Sir - Co-ordination.

RIMMER leaves, FERRET turns and looks at his files.

FERRET
Co-ordination?

INT. CORRIDOR. DAY.

RIMMER goes down corridor passing door marked “CHIEF
STATISTICIAN” N. CRODDER. We hear u strangled cry of
"God" from within. He stops at door marked J. MORRISON,
Public Relations.

INT. MORRISON'S OFFICE. DAY.

RIMMER opens door with considerable difficulty. We see
an office covered in cobwebs. Moths flit to and fro
amidst the dust,

INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE. DAY.

RIMMER closes door and proceeds to Accounts Office. He
opens door to discover Chief Accountant FEDERMANN, who
is on 'phore. The room has the atmosphere and equipment
of an old fashioned betting shop.

FEDERMANN
I'll just read those figures back.
Two pounds to win on Lively Lady.
And a fiver on the Groper ...
(notices RIMMER)
Ah, ha ... good morning.

RIMMER
(smiling)
Good morning.
It's Mr. Federman isn't it?

FEDERMANN
Yes,

RIMMER notes something down on his clipboard and leaves.
CONTINUED:
CONTD,

RIMMER

INT, LAVATORY. DAY. 8

RIMMER enters lavatory and takes up position by door.
PUMER enters,

RIMMER
(smiling)
Mr. Pumer?

PUMER
Yes ... who are you?

RIMMER
Rimmer, Co-ordination ... please carry on,

PUMER goes to pee, puzzled. As he begins RIMMER clicks
stopwatch.

BEGIN TITLES.

PUMER finishes. RIMMER clocks stopwatch again and notes
down findings. Exit PUMER, disturbed. RIMMER tests
automatic towel dispenser. The entire roll falls out.
RIMMER makes a note. Enter FEDERMANN,

RIMMER
Hello again, Mr. Federmann.

FEDERMANN
Oh, hello,

FEDERMANN goes into cubicle, RIMMER clocks stopwatch
then wanders about noting efficiency of taps, plugs,
liquid soap containers etc. None of them work. FEDERMANN
pulls chain: it does not work first two times and when it
does, makes an appalling gurgling roar. RIMMER clicks
stopwatch and makes note. FEDERMANN leaves embarrassedly,

FEDERMANN
Ah, well, back to the grindstane,

CONTINUED:
CONTD.

RIMMER goes into cubicle and climbs up on seat to inspect
the faulty cistern, Enter CRODDER. He goes into next
door cubicle, takes his trousers down, and is about to
begin when he seas RIMMER above him. He leaves cubicle
looking worried.

RIMMER
(cheerfully)
Won't be a moment.

He completes operation end gets down for a test flush,
this is satisfactory.

RIMMER
Would you mind using this one,
Mr, er oa.

CRODDER
Crodder.

CRODDER enters cubicle but does not quite shut the door,
through the crack he peers at RIMMER as he clocks his
stopwatch.

CRODDER
Good God! Is nothing sacred?

END TITLES:
EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LAVATORY. DAY. 9
TANYA is coming down the corridor as CRODDER emerges.
CRODDER
Extraordinary thing just happened in

the john! I went in and there was a
fellow there with a stopwatch.

TANYA
That's Mr, Rimmer, co-ordination.

CRODDER
Is he one of those ghastly Time and

Motion people? CONTINUED:

CONTD,
TANYA
I think he's working for Mr. Fairburn
himself,
RIMMER appears.
CRODDER
(obsequiously)

Good morning ... Well mustn't hang
about ... lots to do.

Two men, FROMAGE and WARING, are advancing purposefully

down the corridor. TANYA leads them to FERRET's office.
RIMMER follows them in.

INT. FERRET'S OFFICE, 10
TANYA
Mr. Fromage and Mr, Waring, Mr. Ferret.

They've come about the advertising.

FERRET
Ah, good morning!

FERRET goes to his desk and sits down.

FERRET

i expect you've come about the advertising.
WARING

Yes, we have.
FERRET

Ah good, Well, I will just get the

WARING
Just over six months ago, Mr. Ferret,
you undertook our new advertising
campaign. We heard from you for the
first time yesterday. You sent us
some slogans for advertising our
dog food,

FERRET
Good.

WARING
We don't make dog food, Mr. Ferret,
we make humbugs.

FERRET
Oh, and you're not thinking of branching
out into dog food?

WARING
No, and if we were, we would want
something more original than “Woof
makes doggies bounce with health",

FERRET
Do get that typewriter fixed, Tanya.

RIMMER
We are working on a new presentation
concept, Mr. Waring. Mr. Ferret will
have it ready in a week.

FERRET

INT. CORRIDOR, DAY. 11

We see RIMMER in longshot in earnest, efficient
conversation with FROMAGE and WARING in corridor.
As they leave we hear the strains of tango music.
RIMMER goes down corridor and stops at PUMER's door.

From inside the office comes the strain of Victor
Sylvester Music, RIMMER listens fur a moment and
then opeus the door quietly.

INT. PUMER'S OFFICE. DAY. 12

Inside is PUMER wearing tails, carnation, learning the
steps of the TANGO. On the floor he has chalked out
foot positions and as RIMMER watches he starts a series
of steps. These involve him in a turn during which he
sights RIMMER, double take, turns again, double take,
turns again.

PUMER
(pointing to marks on the floor)
Tango. My wife and I have been
selected for the South East. I
practise in the coffee break, I
don't have coffee.

RIMMER
(taking a note on his
clipboard)
Pumer with an 'e' isn't it?

INT. FILING ROOM. DAY. 14

FERRET is pretending to get a file, whilst fumbling near
TANYA's legs. RIMMER approaches and watches from the
bottom of a small staircase.

FERRET
Um ... thank you, Tanya, that'll be
all I'm afraid.

FERRET motions TANYA away, she walks down the stairs to
FERRET's office.

TANYA
All right, Mr. Ferret.

RIMMER
If it's all right by you, I'll take
over the office next door to you.

FERRET

Oh good! Yes, look, I'll tell you

FERRET
Tanya, what have you done with my water?

TANYA
The Water Board have cut it off, sir,

FERRET
What have we ever done to them?

TANYA
We haven't paid them, sir.

See you in the pub.

FERRET is kneeling at coca cola machine, cleaning
lipstick off with coke and flannel. PUMER, FEDERMANN
leave and TANYA walks out of office and down the stairs.

FERRET
They'll be cutting the electricity
off next.

The corridor is plunged into darkness. Confusion.
Darkness is pierced only by the beam of RIMMER's torch.
We see FERRET walk into a fire extinguisher by the
light of this.

RIMMER
Goodnight, Mr. Ferret.

FERRET
Ah Rimmer. I was just conducting a
little experiment; on the effect on
office efficiency of total darkness.
i wouldn't bother to tell Mr. Fairburn
about it, he's a bit out of touch with
modern methods,

FERRET

Ah, tonight, I was working late.

MRS. FERRET
I rang the office and they said you
weren't there.

FERRET
Really? Who did you speak to?

MRS. FERRET
A Mr. Rimmer,

FERRET
Ah yes, as I was working late I told him
to say that I wasn't there. Full marks
to Rimmer.

MRS. FERRET
You come in here reeking of sex and scent
and with a love bite on your neck.

FERRET
It's not scent dear nor is it a love bite.
I happened to be washing my face with
coca cola when the lights went out and I
banged my neck on the fire extinguisher.

boot polish for breakfast ,.. I'm afraid

FAIRBURN
Was it? Ah, it was timely was it? Yes.
Well that's what decisions should be.
It seemed to have slipped my mind and
my wife's been rather under the weather.

RIMMER
Nothing serious I hope.

quite a while yet.

RIMMER
(handing over a file)
Here's the report sir.

FAIRBURN
It's a bit long ... could you give me a
rundown I'm a bit busy today.

negligence.

FERRET
£75,000 ... that igs a lot

You owe me a lot of money Ferret! And

I have the results of our survey into
why the sales of Olde English Humbugs
are declining.

WARING
You can be frank with us ... what does
it show?

RIMMER

The consumer strongly dislikes the taste
of your product, furthermore it's
extreme hardness makes it almost
impossible to eat.

FROMAGE
That's very true.

WARING
Nobody knows that better than us.

RIMMER
But I thiak it might be possible to
make a virtue out of these faults with
the right kind of campaign.

tube of Scorpios,

She reaches for her bag on the bedside table, unzips it
and langorously withdraws a silver tube, she caresses

the top and squeezes out a mint which she places sensuously
in her mouth; she begins to chew, a look of mounting
excitement on her face.

V.0.
The refreshing hardness tingles on her
tongue; she doesn't need him any more.

V.O. CHOIR SINGING,
Scorpio, the mint that lingers longer

FERRET at breakfast table reading the Daily News Sex Poll
Newspaper. Headlines read "Sex and the British. Yes, It's
Randy Britain . You've never had it so often."

MRS. FERRET
I think it's disgusting, shoving sex
down people's throats at the breakfast
table.

MRS. FERRET is dusting feverishly.

FERRET
It's only a poll dear.

FERRET
Well if you spent a little less time
reading about sex and a bit more time
doing something about it.

FERRET
Ido...

MRS. FERRET is startled.

FERRET
That is I don't ... anyway I'm reading
about the pound ... its on the floor

Fors Ale: its a new beer we're
advertising. Fors Ale makes you
hearty and hale.

A sensational Poll this morning purports
to give the answers. I have with me
Mr. Michael Rimmer of Fairburn Polls
and Peter Niss of the rival International
Opinion Polls.
I have the feeling Mr. Rimmer ..,

RIMMER
Congratulations.

The studio audience laugh.

HENCH
I get the impression that you conducted
this survey because you felt that this
kind of scientifically disguised smut
would get your firm maximum puhlicity,

RIMMER
Could you tell me why you've invited me
on the programme?

HENCH
To find out your real motives for
publishing the poll.

RIMMER
And to talk about sex.

NISS
Do lets try not to be frivolous.

RIMMER
Sex may be frivolous to you Mr. Niss...
but its not for me ... or for that matter,
the vast majority of people in this
country,

NISS
But do we really want to know how many
times a week and how satisfactory the
results.

RIMMER ~*
Yes I do ... I think everybody's interested...

NISS
Well it's not the sort of Poll that we
could conduct at I.0.P.

RIMMER
I think, that's a pity because the more
we know about what people really feel and
want, the better. This is the only way
we're going to be able to adapt our society
to fit its real needs. I think Polls are
only beginning.

HENCH
Now lets see how our audience feels.

HENCH takes hand mike and goes into audience. He approaches
a man who obviously doesn't want to talk, hiding his face
behind his hands.

HENCH
You sir ... what do you think about
publicising people's personal sexual
habits.

The man still hidden shakes his head and tries to wave
HENCH away.

HENCH
Ah you seem to disapprove ... wonder
if your wife agrees.

HENCH turns to woman next to him.
WOMAN

I'm not his wife .ss go away.

inappropriate remarks such as ... ask him how his bishoprick

possibly be misused, I have, therefore,
created a National Poll board under the
Chairmanship of Peter Niss.

I have chosen him not because he is a
personal friend of myself and my wife,
but because he brings that added
dimension of knowing how best to keep
open the lines of communication between
you the people and us, your servants.

Now you know that I have never sought
power ... and now that I have power I
want to share it with you; for it is
you, the people of Britain who have
made this country great ... as Winston

There's one here suggesting a pre-
emptive nuclear strike against
Northern Ireland,

DIRECTOR
Action,

RIMMER and PAT walk arm in arm,

RIMMER

As your Prime Minister, I hope I've
never been afraid to admit my own
mistakes, In every way the country
is booming but I must admit that our
experiment in participatory democracy
seems to have run into difficulties
perhaps I was too idealistic and in
this modern world we may well need a
more streamlined form of Presidential
Government. You must let me know
if you share this feeling. Next

a week, you will have the chance to
tell me, in what could be, if it is
your wish, the last referendum for
sometime.

CONTD,

WILTING
I've read this Referendum. What
you're suggesting is nothing more
or less than a dictatorship.

RIMMER
Hugh, like everyone else, you will
have an opportunity of voting against
it. It's quite democratic.

WILTING
But what you don't realise is that
90% of the population are idiots.

RIMMER
You said it, Hugh.

WILTING
You won't get away with this, Rimmer.
