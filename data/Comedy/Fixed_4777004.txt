FADE IN:

EXT. FAMILY HOME - DAY.
A friendly-looking neighbourhood. A STRAY DOG loiters in
the front yard.
INT. FAMILY HOME - DAY.
JEMIMAH, five, stands in front of her MOTHER.
MOTHER
Tilly is going to need lots of
cuddles. She’s going in for an

operation next week.

Jemimah is concerned.

JEMIMAH
Why?

MOTHER
Uh ... she’s just having a
check-up -

JEMIMAH
Why?

MOTHER
Because ... she needs one.

JEMIMAH
Is she sick?

MOTHER
Why don’t you go out and play with

her now?
The mother walks off, Jemimah watches her go, then looks
to TILLY, a golden cocker spaniel, at the glass door.
JEMIMAH’S BEDROOM.

Jemimah pulls a wooden box out from under her bed. She
opens it and removes a nurse’s hat and toy stethoscope.
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY.
Jemimah sits on a rug and checks Tilly’s heartbeat with
the stethoscope. Then she checks her own. She calls

back to the house.

JEMIMAH
Heart’s good.

Jemimah takes out a thermometer and tries to put it in
Tilly’s mouth. Tilly just licks it.

She takes a Paddle Pop stick and tries to inspect Tilly’s
tonsils, with difficulty.

JEMIMAH
Open wide. Say “R”!

She recoils at the smell.

JEMIMAH
Tilly, your breath stinks!

From off-screen, she grabs a blood pressure monitor.

She realises Tilly’s arms are too thin, so she wraps it
around her neck.

She pumps it up, Tilly whimpers and breaks free.

JEMIMAH
It’s not that bad.

She offers Tilly a lollypop.

A thought occurs to Jemimah. She stands and calls back
to the house.

JEMIMAH
Mum, does Tilly need insulin too?

INT. FAMILY HOME - DAY.

The mother can’t hear over her vacuuming.
INT. GARAGE - DAY.

Jemimah’s FATHER is lying beneath the car, fixing the
undercarriage. Her teenage BROTHER stands about.

JEMIMAH
Dad? What’s wrong with Tilly?

He takes a moment to respond.

FATHER (0.S.)
Go ask your mother.

BROTHER
(whispers to her)
She’s getting the chop.

JEMIMAH
Chopped?

BROTHER
So she can’t get fucked.

JEMIMAH
(loudly)
FUCKED?

The father hits his head as he tries to get out from
under the car. He looks angrily to the brother, then
smiles at Jemimah.

FATHER
Sweetheart, it’s because we don’t
want ... it’s so she can’t have
puppies.
JEMIMAH
(confused)

But, but I want the puppies!

The father slaps the brother in the back of the head.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT.

Jemimah sits at the dinner table with her brother,
parents and her pregnant teenage SISTER, the elephant
in the room. They eat in complete silence. Jemimah
stares at her sister’s belly.
LIVING ROOM.

Jemimah’s mother cleans, the rest of the family sits in
front of the TELEVISION.

TELEVISION
(English documentary accent)
This rhinoceros is particularly
aroused —

The father changes the channels.
TELEVISION
(home cooking voice)
Make sure you stuff it all the
way in -
The father changes channels again.
TELEVISION
(exercise instructor,
to a beat)
- and out - and in - and out - c’mon,
break a sweat!
The father changes channels again.
TELEVISION
(American accent)
And now, for our worst teenage moms -
The father changes channels again.
TELEVISION
(English vet accent)
Look at these beautiful puppies!
The father shuts off the television.

Jemimah looks at the blank screen, wide-eyed.

The father slaps the brother in the back of the head.

EXT. FAMILY HOME - DAY.

Jemimah sits in the front yard at a table. She has a
lemonade stand set up. Tilly waits with her.
Several NEIGHBOURS walk past and give her strange looks.
Several TEENAGERS laugh and take photos.

We see a sign reading “PLEASE FUCKED MY DOG”.
The mother emerges from the house, walks up to the stand,
pulls down the sign and carries Jemimah inside.
INT. JEMIMAH’S BEDROOM - DAY.
Jemimah, upset, lies on the floor opposite Tilly.
JEMIMAH
(mother’s tone)
Puppies are hard work, Tilly.
There’s going to be enough babies
around this house. We don’t need
you to make it worse.
(beat, whispers)
But I want the puppies too, Tilly.

SISTER’S BEDROOM.

Jemimah sits at the computer. She opens a browser and
sees her sister’s dating profile.

She thinks for a moment, then replaces her sister’s
picture with a photo of Tilly. Jemimah can be seen in
the photo’s background.

She deletes her sister’s information and adds:

“HELO I AM TILLY AND A DOG AND LIKE WALKS AND BONES AND
BALLS AND I WANT TILLY TO HAVE PUPPIES”.

Jemimah hits save and smiles with satisfaction.

MOMENTS LATER.
Jemimah rummages through her sister’s cupboard.

She pulls out a see-through bra, leather skirt and
fishnet stockings and puts them down on the bed.

Tilly watches.
EXT. STREETS - DAY.

The father and brother are driving home. They see
Jemimah on a street corner with Tilly dressed in the
sister’s clothes. The father slams on the brake.

INT. FAMILY HOME - DAY.

Jemimah sits quietly with Tilly, who is still dolled-up.
She can hear her parents in the next room.

FATHER (0.S.)
I don’t care how clean the house
is, you’re meant to be looking
after her!

MOTHER (0O.S.)
Where were you? You didn’t tell

me you were going out!

Jemimah takes her sister’s clothes off Tilly.

SISTER’S BEDROOM.

Jemimah sits at the computer. She has a instant chat
message from the dating site.

It reads “HELLO TILLY. RANDY HERE.”
She responds “HI”.
The other user types “DO YOU WANT TO MEET?”

She responds “OK”.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY.
Jemimah is brushing Tilly’s coat.

JEMIMAH
Now don’t be scared. I’11 be
with you. And then we can
have the puppies.
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT.

The family eats in silence. Jemimah is cheerful. The
brother checks his phone and laughs.

BROTHER
Your lemonade stand has gone viral.

The father hits him in the back of the head again.

INT. JEMIMAH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Jemimah lies in the dark, wide awake. She climbs out of
bed and attaches Tilly’s lead.

EXT. FAMILY HOME - NIGHT.

Jemimah and Tilly come out the front door and walk off.

EXT. BOTTLE SHOP - NIGHT.

Jemimah and Tilly walk past a group of LOITERING YOUTHS,
who are drinking.

YOUTH
Hey, it’s the “Fucked My Dog” kid.

They all laugh.

EXT. TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE HOUSE - NIGHT.

Jemimah knocks at the door. It opens and she’s led
inside with Tilly. The door closes loudly and locks.

INT. DARK CORRIDOR, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE HOUSE.

The sound of dogs barking, junk littered about.

WARM LIVING ROOM.

Jemimah sits opposite MARGE, an elderly woman who
nurses Tilly.
MARGE
Do your parents know you’re here?

Jemimah shakes her head.

MARGE
You shouldn’t be out at night.
Not at your age. You don’t know me.
I thought Local Bitches dot com was
a dog breeding site. You can
understand my confusion when you
look at some of the girls on there.

JEMIMAH
(moans)
My sister’s always on there.
Where’s Randy?

MARGE
That’s him in the basket.

Marge points to RANDY, sleeping in the corner, then feels
Tilly’s stomach.

MARGE
Your parents want to have Tilly
de-sexed? They’re a bit late,
she’s already expecting. Tilly’s
going to be a mummy very soon.
Jemimah lights up with a wide smile.
JEMIMAH
She’s having the puppies?!
INT. MARGE’S CAR - NIGHT.
Marge drives Jemimah home. Jemimah, still beaming,
nurses Tilly.
EXT. FAMILY HOME - NIGHT.
Marge’s car pulls into the driveway. The POLICE and

Jemimah’s parents are waiting.

FADE OUT.
FADE IN:

INT. FAMILY HOME - DAY.

Jemimah’s sister nurses a newborn baby. Jemimah plays
with a litter of PUPPIES.

JEMIMAH (V.O.)
They say that to have good luck
is the best plan. I don’t know what
that means but what I do know now is
that kids can find some really
helpful strangers on Internet
dating sites.

FADE OUT.
