EXT. CASCADE MOUNTAIN RANGE. WASHINGTON STATE. DAWN. 1

In the early morning dawn, the Skykomish River in Washington
State's Cascade Mountain Range pounds against the granite
river rocks.

Giant Fir branches in the lush forest undulate, almost
dancing in the soft wind.

A BLACK-TAILED BUCK makes its way through the dense woods.

The deer walks to the bank, dips its mouth into the river,
and drinks.

Tall grass parts and out of the morning fog comes a young
man, completely COVERED IN MUD, a massive, serrated hunting
knife in his hands.

This is BODEVAN. He's 18, with wispy hair down to his
shoulders.

The deer turns its head, sensing something.
Bo freezes - perfectly camouflaged in the tall grass.

The deer sniffs the air, but as Bo is covered in mud and
animal skins, it smells nothing. It relaxes, drinking from
the river again.

Bo exhales, silently.

In a flash, Bo leaps out of the grass and in one continuous
motion, tackles the deer and slices the animal’s carotid
artery. The deer does nothing more than flinch, blood spurts
from it’s neck and it just folds, hemorrhagic shock taking
over.

It's a perfect kill.

Bo watches and the animal takes its final breath.

Then he signals and five KIDS glide into the clearing. They
range in age from 14 to 6, all have long, unruly hair, dirty
faces, and wear, over the usual kid's clothes of t-shirts and
jeans, what looks like animal skins. They are: two twin 15-
year old girls, KIELYR and VESPYR; RELLIAN, a boy of 13;
ZAJA, a 8-year old girl; and lastly, NAI, a 6-year old boy.

The other kids surround Bo, staring down at the fallen deer.

Like some primordial warrior, his upper body camouflaged by
mud, BEN CASH rises out of the grass. He's 45 and has a
formidable beard, but his body is lithe and muscular, fit
like a man half his age.

Ben plunges his finger in the deer's throat. He paints a
stripe of blood across Bo's face.

BEN
Today. The boy is dead. And in his
place. Is a man.
Everyone pauses for the deep solemnity of the moment.

Bo slits open the animal; its innards spill onto the earth.

Ben raises his hands high in the air and - as if he's saying
a prayer - closes his eyes.

The IMAGE FREEZES - as the title comes up around him:

CAPTAIN FANTASTIC

EXT. FOREST. MORNING. 2

Trailed by the rest of the family, Ben and Bo carry the deer -
legs tied to a tree limb - through the thick forest.

EXT. TIPI. MORNING. 3

While Ben and Bo attach the deer's feet to rope, swing the
rope over a tree, and string it high off the ground, we get
our first glimpse of their "home."

In a clearing, hidden under a canopy of enormous Douglas Fir
trees, next to a small greenhouse garden - a large Tipi sits
behind a fire pit.

A few of the kids jump on small wooden platforms, grab
hanging rope, and pull themselves up on these little
"elevators." Cascading high into the trees above the Tipi is
a kid's paradise of funky tree houses, zip lines, rope
bridges, hammocks, and observation platforms.

Rellian strums on a guitar. He sings "Little Red Corvette" by
Prince.

BEN
Training in one hour!

Ben watches as, in front of their Tipi, strung from a rope
on a tree, the twins skin the deer that Bo shot: peeling off
its hide with none of the squeamishness of 15-year olds and
all the skill of experienced butchers.

Behind them, 12-year old Rellian, with a flint that he
extracts from a pouch on his belt, makes a fire in a large
pit in front of the Tipi.

VESPYR
Dad. Where's the boning knife? Zaja.

Ben nods.

EXT. TREE HOUSE. DAY. 4

Ben climbs up a wood ladder, ducking intricately woven
branches to enter what looks like a massive bird's nest.

Zaja sits on the floor, cleaning the skeleton of a small
animal with a 6-inch boning knife.

Inside, the tree house has been turned into some kind of
grotesque Death Shrine. It's plastered with actual animal
skeletons, magazine photographs of dead bodies from the
Holocaust, and pictures of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. From
the look on Ben's face, this is the first time he's seen
Zaja's interior design.

BEN
Jesus.

Zaja looks at the photo on the wall. She shakes her head no.

ZAJA
Pol Pot.

Ben puts out his hand and Zaja passes him the boning knife.

EXT. MOUNTAIN MEADOW. MORNING. 5

In a mountain meadow, Ben and the kids, their eyes closed,
sit cross-legged in a circle.

Silence.

Apart from the rustle of the leaves as the wind blows through
the trees, the occasional chirping of distant birds.

(CONTINUED)
GREEN (9.2.2014) 4.
CONTINUED: 5

Ben opens his eyes and says, "Okay."

All the children jump up, wooden sticks in their hands, and
Ben teaches them what looks like commando knife-fighting.

This is not a suburban mall karate class.

Bo slashes at Ben with his stick. In one swift movement, Ben
deflects with his forearm and hip-throws Bo. Bo hits the
ground hard, Ben's stick already pressing into Bo's throat. A
kill strike, shocking in its sudden violence.

The others watch, taking all of this utterly seriously, then
break into pairs and practice the move.

Rellian glares at his father, but makes no move to join.

Ben watches Kielyr and Vespyr. They're attacking and
defending like it's a choreographed dance.

BEN
If you don't stab to kill. Really
stab. For the liver. Or the kidneys.
She'll never learn.

ZAJA
Shouldn't we aim here? A knife in
the lungs creates pneumothorax. Or
next to the sternum, to penetrate
the heart? That would be instant
death.

Ben looks over at his 8-year old, standing next to Nai.

BEN
If it makes you happy, Zaj. Sure.
Aim for the heart.

Vespyr eyes her sister, but is still hesitating.

BEN (CONT'D)
The stick will break before it hurts
her.

Vespyr attacks again, but this time she overcompensates,
Kielyr's parry is ineffectual, and Vespyr's stick hits her
sister in the stomach. The stick breaks and Kielyr YELPS in
pain.

BEN (CONT'D)
Good.

KIELYR
What?! How is that good? She stabbed
me! She fucking stabbed me!

BEN
Then you better learn to defend
yourself.

Ben hands Vespyr another stick.

EXT. TIPI. NIGHT. 6

Flames illuminate the faces of the family, as they eat roast
venison, sitting on the ground in a circle around the fire.

By the light of candles and kerosene lamps, the kids are all
reading books way beyond their years: Nai is reading the
Encyclopedia Brittanica, he's on letter "J"; Kielyr is
reading "Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human
Societies" by Jared Diamond; Rellian reads Dostoyevsky's "The
Brothers Karamazov;" Bo is reading a college Calculus
textbook.

BEN
Zaj. Page.

Zaja holds "Middlemarch" by George Eliot. She glances at the
page number.

ZAJA
398.

Ben records this in a notebook.

BEN
You still liking it?

Zaja nods.
BEN (CONT'D)
I thought you would. To stay on
schedule for the test you need to be
finished in 8 days. Vesp?

Vespyr holds "The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the
Texture of Reality" by Brian Greene.

VESPYR
Just finished Chapter 12, "The World
on a String."

Ben looks up at her.

VESPYR (CONT'D)

What.
BEN
Are you having trouble with quantum
entanglement?
VESPYR
No.
BEN
Planck length vs. Planck time?
VESPYR
I'm fine.
BEN

Good, then tomorrow you can give a
little presentation on M-Theory,
argue counter-points with Bo and
Rell vis-a-vis Witten and Dirac.

Vespyr makes a face at Kielyr. Neither sees that Ben catches
the look.

Ben puts down his notebook. He watches the children reading
for a moment.

Then he picks up his guitar. Improvises a rhythmic strum.
Punctuates it with little, abrupt vocalizations. So funky one
can't help but be drawn in.

The kids ignore him, but gradually, one at a time, each of
them pick up a different musical instrument - a flute, drums,

a trombone, a violin - and joins him.

Soon, everyone is up on their feet. Dancing and singing and
playing their instruments - illuminated by the light of the
fire - grooving to their improvised song and having a blast.
EXT. FOREST. MORNING. 7
Leaping over stumps, ducking under branches, Ben and the kids
race through the forest.

EXT. SHED. DAY. 8

From out of his workshop shed, Ben carries some handmade
wooden birdhouses, helped by Bo and Vespyr.
GREEN (9.2.2014) 7.

A8& EXT./INT. FOREST/STEVE. DAY. A8

Ben and the kids walk toward a a beat-up, 36-foot long blue
1989 Thomas Saf-T-Liner school bus, parked on a forest path.

BEN
Try not to kill each other before we
get back.

KIELYR

If training is over today, can we
take Steve somewhere for class time
later?

NAIL
Why don't we have a Mommy?

This catches the attention of all the kids. They all stop and

look at Ben.

BEN
You do have a Mommy.

VESPYR
You said she would only be gone for
a week.

BEN
It hasn't been very long.

KIELYR
It's been three months, two weeks,
six days, and eleven hours.

BODEVAN
Mom is very ill.

KIELYR
Don't talk to us like we're your
inferiors.

BODEVAN

Who knew there were so many geniuses
in the world.

VESPYR
Dad, Bo is being sarcastic.

BEN
That was sardonic. Sarcastic would
be...

BEN (CONT'D)
"Your genius is blinding." They're
both mocking, but sarcastic is
directed at a person and meant to
hurt. Sardonic is less direct and is
said more for laughs or for wit. Grab
the end.

VESPYR
We DO know about Mom.

BODEVAN
You think you do, but you have no
concept of the scope or the depth of
her illness.

KIELYR
Dad, Bo is being condescending.

BEN
Bo's right. Mom has to be ina
hospital now.

VESPYR
But you said hospitals are only a
great place to go to if you're a
healthy person and you want to die.

ZAJA
You said Americans are undereducated
and overmedicated.

KIELYR
You said that the AMA are avaricious
whores only too willing to spread
their fat legs for Big Pharma.

BEN
Not enough of the neurotransmitter
serotonin to conduct electrical
signals in Mom's brain. A lack of
receptor sites. Acute tryptophan
depletion. We don't know exactly what
it is. Selective Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitors - Celexa, Lexapro, Paxil,
Zoloft - or Selective Norepinephrine
Reuptake Inhibitors - Cymbalta,
Effexor, Pristiq - it's simply the
most effective way to manage it.

RELLIAN
Exactly when is Mom coming back?

BEN
That's what I'm going to find out.

Ben, Bo, Vespyr, and Kielyr climb on the bus and we see that
the interior has been customized, the rows of seats removed

and replaced with a full library, a closet full of clothes,

desks, maps on the walls, loft beds in the back. Ben closes

the doors and, on the outside of the glass door panels is a

spray-painted, stenciled word: “Steve.”

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. 9

Steve the Bus winds down through the mountains.

INT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM. DAY. 10

Bo, Vespyr, and Kielyr sit in a dentist’s waiting room,
mMarvelling at the synthetic, brightly-colored office. Peppy
MUZAK plays as Ben approaches the desk.

BEN

We have an appointment. Vespyr and

Kielyr Cash. My daughters. They’re

15. It’s time they see a dentist.
The RECEPTIONIST stares at him. She checks the appointment
book.
EXT. SMALL TOWN STORE. DAY. 11
Bo and Ben are unloading their handmade wooden birdhouses in
front of a store. A group of TEENAGE GIRLS walk out and one
of them smiles at Bo.

TEENAGE GIRL
You comin' in?

Bo shrugs, avoiding her eyes.

TEENAGE GIRL (CONT’D)
Yes? No? Okay. 'Bye.

Bo turns red and just nods.

As the girls walk away, the one who held the door for Bo
looks back at him, then says something to her friends, who
all check Bo out and giggle.

BEN
Go talk to her.

BODEVAN
Ask her what she thinks about the
working people creating an armed
revolution against the exploiting
classes and their state structures?

BEN
Marxists can be just as genocidal
as.... No. Just... I don't know.
Talk about -

BODEVAN

Whether or not she's a Dialectical
Materialist and accords primacy to
the class struggle?

BEN
Avoid... Marxism. Or telling her
you're a Trotskyite.
BODEVAN
"Trotskyist." Only a Stalinist would
call a Trotskyist a "Trotskyite." And
I'm not a Trotskyist anymore. I'ma
Maoist.
Ben nods. He hands Bo a key and Bo walks away.
The STORE OWNER comes out and hands Ben a wad of cash.
STORE OWNER
Sold all the stuff from last time.
You said you’d be back months ago.
INT. POST OFFICE. DAY. 12
Bo opens a large post office box. Inside, the box is packed
with mail. There are the new issues of "Scientific American,"
"National Geographic," "The New Yorker," and "The Economist."
And then a stack of large envelopes.
Bo looks at the first one. It's marked, "PRINCETON
UNIVERSITY."
INT. POST OFFICE. DAY. 13

In another corner of the post office, Bo holds up a piece of
paper.

It reads, "We are pleased to welcome you to Harvard
University, the class of 2015."

He looks at the other envelopes, all now opened, spread on

the counter before him. They are from Dartmouth, Brown,

M.I.T., Yale, and Stanford.

On top of the opened envelopes are welcome letters from every
university.

EXT. SMALL TOWN BAR. DAY. 14
In the front of the bar, Ben dials a number on the house

phone. We don't see who he's talking to (but will come to

realize that it's HARPER, his sister).

HARPER (0.S.)
Ben?

Immediately, from the tone of Harper's voice, Ben can tell
something is very wrong.

BEN
What is it?

Silence.

BEN (CONT'D)
Harper.

Ben hears a sharp, irregular exhalation of breath. Whatever
is wrong is serious enough to be very difficult to say.

BEN (CONT'D)
Tell me.

HARPER (0.S.)
Leslie killed herself last night.

The blood drains from Ben's face. He is frozen for a moment.
No reaction whatsoever.

BEN
How?

Another pause.

BEN (CONT'D)
Harper, tell me.

HARPER (0.S.)
She jumped out of a window.

HARPER (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Ben?

Ben hangs up the phone.

INT. STEVE - MOVING. DAY. Al4

Ben drives in silence. He looks in the rearview mirror, at
Bo, Vespyr, and Kielyr. They stare out the window, completely
unaware of his recent phone call.

INT. TIPI. NIGHT. 15

Illuminated by candles and kerosine lamps, all the kids sit
together, dressed for bed, staring expectantly at their
father.

Ben takes a deep breath.

BEN
Last night. Mommy killed herself.
She jumped out of a window. Your
mother is dead.

As the reality of Ben's words hit them, utter devastation
passes over the children's face. And then, in a matter of
seconds, they all burst into tears, snot comes out of their
noses, tears roll down their faces, some of them are almost
hyperventilating. Grieving openly and deeply, it's like
something out of Greek Tragedy. Elemental. Primal.

ZAJA
What's going to happen to us?

BEN
Nothing is going to change. We'll
continue living exactly the same
way. We're a family.

Rellian stands. He yells. Savage, guttural shouts. They're
fierce and pained, like a trapped animal.

RELLIAN
Mom! Mom!

He picks up a knife, but just paces, red-faced, not knowing
what to do with it.

INT. TIPI. NIGHT. 16
LESLIE's face. Smiling. Giggling.

She is leaning over, swaying back and forth, dragging her
long auburn hair across Ben's face.

She dips down and kisses him. Over and over again. She's
laughing.

She SPEAKS, but NO SOUND comes out of her mouth.

INT. TIPI. NIGHT. 17

Ben opens his eyes. He sits up and blinks, peering into the
darkness of the Tipi. The kids are asleep.

Leslie is not there.
He lights a candle and opens a dresser. Under his clothes, he
withdraws a hidden manila folder. One file is marked WILL AND
TESTAMENT. He rifles through the papers until he finds what
he's looking for. He reads. His face turns white.
BEN
Jesus fucking Christ.

EXT. TIPI. DAWN. 18

Ben stands outside the Tipi. He brings his bagpipes to his
lips and blows.

Out comes that eerie and persistent WAIL.

EXT. FOREST. MORNING. 19
Ben bolts through a dense rainforest - creating an obstacle
course as he goes - dodging trees, bounding over rocks and
fallen logs.

Straggling behind, the kids all follow his exact movements.

Then the twins.

BEN (CONT'D)
1:11. I'm embarrassed for you.

Then Rell.

BEN (CONT'D)

1:18. You're plateauing. You're going
back to eccentric contractions and
leg cycling.

Then Zaja and Nai pass him.

BEN (CONT'D)

1:26 and... 1:29. Fine if you both
were THREE! Subpar! This is subpar!
No rest!

Ben dodges back the woods and the kids follow.

EXT. MEADOW. MORNING. 20

In a meadow, Ben leads everyone through a complicated series
of calisthenics: jump squats into burpies into holding plank.
This is hard-core functional training and the kids move
through the exercises like athletes.

BEN
The Rule of Three. Nai.

NAI
You can survive 3 minutes without
air.

BEN

Ben finally turns to look at his son.

EXT. SMALL TOWN BAR. DAY. 21

Ben is again on the bar’s house phone, now talking to
Leslie's father, JACK.

JACK (0.S.)
The utter recklessness, the
instability and insecurity that you

We did that. Listen. I found her
Will. I assume you know that Leslie
was a Buddhist.

There is a long pause on the line.

JACK (0.S.)
Leslie was a nudist?

BEN
Buddhist. Leslie was a BUDDHIST. She
wanted to be cremated. Not buried. It
was very important to her that -

JACK (0.S.)
I have just lost my only child. I’m
in no mood to discuss the particulars
of her funeral.

BEN
There's more. Look, this is...
strange, I admit, but in her Will,
Leslie clearly stipulated that -

JACK (0.S.)
I rue the day she met you. Wherever
you are, you stay there.

BEN
Jack.

JACK (0.S.)
I miss grandchildren. But you are not
welcome here. Is that clear? You show
up. I will have you arrested.

The phone goes silent.

BEN
Can we just speak civilly? Hello?

ABIGAIL, Leslie's mother, now speaks.

ABIGAIL (0.S.)
I miss them. The children.

BEN
Jack just said he'll have us
arrested if we come. Did you hear
that?

ABIGAIL (0.S.)
He's very upset. I'm sorry. It's
best to do what he says.

There's a CLICK and a DIAL TONE as she hangs up the phone.

EXT. TIPI. EVENING. 22

While Ben cooks venison over a large fire, the kids, all deep
in their private thoughts, stare into the flames.

Nai exits the Tipi. He's completely naked.

BODEVAN
Mom hated that world.

BEN
Clothes when we eat.

Nai disappears back into the Tipi.
VESPYR
We're in the very unique position of
hating those people.

Can "unique" be modified?

Kielyr pauses for a second, surprised by the accuracy of
Nai's description.

VESPYR
We're her family. We have to go.

KIELYR
Grandpa said we can't.

Ben takes venison off the fire and cuts it into small pieces.

KIELYR (CONT’D)
What will happen if they arrest you?
Will they take us away from you?

At this, all the kids turn to look at Ben.

Ben points to the earth, Rellian's shoe prints in the dirt.

BEN
You don't want to be followed, you
should take off your shoes.

Rell is silent.

BEN (CONT'D)
Mom's illness had nothing to do with
you guys. It was chemical. She loved
you very much. None of this is your
fault. But I can't help you. Unless
you talk to me.

RELLIAN
All we do is fucking talk! Why won’t

We're her family. We have to go. We
need a ritual. To heal.

VESPYR
For the grieving process.

ZAJA
Plus Grandpa can't oppress us.

Ben stops. He looks at Rellian.

VESPYR
We're strong. We're ready.

Ben leads the kids as they climb up the face of a vertical
granite formation. They all wear climbing harnesses,
carabiners around their belts, and are tied onto the bright
orange climbing rope, following Ben as he makes his way up
the face. It's an expert grade and they're all struggling.

Without warning, Rellian slips - plummeting at least ten feet
- falling hard. The rope catches and he swings, spiraling
into the granite face. He smashes his hand against the rock,
but finally manages to steady himself, grabbing hold of the
face with his other hand.

RELLIAN
Fuck!

Rellian is shaking, trying to catch his breath. He looks
down. Hundreds of feet below are a cluster of massive rocks.

The other kids wait, looking up at Ben for guidance. Ben

BEN
There is no cavalry. No one will
magically appear to save you in the

Rellian grits his teeth. He stretches out his leg again. But
he's losing balance. Right before he slips, he pushes off
with his other foot and swings, just managing to land on the
far edge that seemed too far. As soon as he lands, he swings
and leaps again, finding a hand hold with his good hand. He
looks up at his dad and nods.

Steve winds through tree-lined, middle-class neighborhoods.
Most of the homes are new and have grass lawns out front.

The bus stops in front of a two-story house.

INT. HARPER'S HOUSE. NIGHT. 58

JUSTIN, Harper's 15-year old son, sits in front of his
computer. He wears over-sized skater clothes and has a shaved
head. He shows Rellian how to play Grand Theft Auto 5.

Rellian is in heaven.

Over the SOUNDS of EXPLOSIONS and GUNFIRE and SCREAMS, Bo,
Kielyr, Vespyr, and Zaja just sit on Jackson's bed, trying to
make sense of this alien environment.

The walls are plastered with band and movie posters. People
they don't recognize and movies they've never seen or heard

The photograph is of Ben and Leslie, taken at their wedding.
She wears a white dress and pushes cake into Ben's mouth.

JACKSON (0.S.)
Life's a bitch.

Nai turns to see JACKSON, Harper's 13-year old son. He is
dressed in the same over-sized skater clothes as his brother
and has the same shaved head.

Yeah.

Nai nods.

Life fucking sucks, man.

Nai has no answer for this. He bites his lip.

Dude.

Jackson just nods his head over and over. Then he spots the
knife on Nai's belt.

JACKSON (CONT’D)
Whoa! Can I check that out?

Nai hands Jackson his new knife. Jackson swings it around.

Do I really have to say this out

real sword?

BEN
It's not a sword. It's a knife.
HARPER
Why does a 6-year old have a knife...

BEN

It's primarily for butchering meat,
but you can use it for making skins,
creating shelters. It has many uses.

Harper stares at her brother for a minute. Then she shakes
her head, resigned disappointment on her face.

HARPER

I'm putting this in the knife drawer.
He can have it back when you leave.

A crystallized, highly addictive

their Nikes.

Harper smiles. Weakly.

Children do not drink wine.

In France, children drink wine all

Dave looks at Ben. Then back at his son.

DAVE
Well. Aunt Leslie was sick. And she

the food and water supplies of the
indigenous people. Horrific acts of
violence were committed on both
sides. But as the US government
wasn't doing anything about the
frisky natives, people thought they'd
better settle this themselves. So in
the pre-dawn hours of April 30, 1871,
146 armed men surprised a camp of
Apaches. Almost all women and
children, as the men were off hunting
for food.

kids, as they scramble around, trying to get dressed.

Each kid is wearing their favorite piece of clothing. The
twins wear pink tights and Tu-Tus, Nai has on his frayed
Whale costume, Zaja is wearing what looks like some kind of
military outfit, and Bo is wearing his thrift-store suit.

Rellian is still in his pajamas, staring at them all.

We can do whatever we want.

RELLIAN

A sea of mourners in BLACK sit a large Catholic church for
the funeral Mass.

The PRIEST stands in front of the congregation, an enormous
statue of Christ on the Cross above the altar at his back. As
he speaks, in a warm and caring voice, incense smoke rises
behind him.

PRIEST
O God, to whom mercy and forgiveness
belong, hear our prayers on behalf of
your servant Leslie Cash, whom you
have called out of the world: and
because she put her hope and trust in
you, command that she be carried
safely home to Heaven and come to
enjoy your eternal reward. Amen.

The entire crowd repeats, "Amen."

Just then, Ben and his brightly-colored family walk to the
front of the church.

They pass Harper, Dave, Justin and Jackson, who find it hard
to mask their utter shock at the sight of what Ben and his
kids are wearing.

Ben and the kids sit in the first row.

nothing he can do now.

Ben nods at Jack. Jack looks away, at the priest.
The priest eyes the newcomers for a second, then continues.

PRIEST (CONT'D)
I did not know Leslie personally. And
I am poorer for it. But I understand
that she was a loving mother who gave
up her law practice to raise her
children. Leslie loved her mother,
Angela, her father, Jack, and their
dogs, Harvey and Little Bear. They
have told me that she also loved
gardening. And classical music.
Particularly Glenn Gould's version of
the Goldberg Variations. And walks in
the moonlight on the beach. And she
loved her husband Ben and their
children -

BEN
I'll take that as my cue, if I may.

Before Jack can stop him, Ben jogs to the front of the
church. He stands directly in front of the priest.

BEN (CONT'D)
First off, Leslie practiced

Buddhism. Which, to her, was a
philosophy and not an organized
religion. In fact, Leslie abhorred
organized religion, thought it the
single most dangerous fairy-tale

ever invented, used to strike fear
and obedience into the hearts of the
innocent and uninformed. She saw it
not just as a source of injustice,
but as a crime against humanity. To
her - the only thing worse than death
would have been the knowledge that
her rotting flesh was to be trapped
for all eternity in a box in the
middle of a fucking golf course.

At this, there are audible GASPS from the congregation.

Jack pushes his way out of the pew and whispers to some
USHERS IN BLACK SUITS.

cherished.

Ben looks at his kids. They nod at him, encouraging him to

continue.

BEN (CONT'D)
If nothing else. Leslie had a sense
of humor.

Ushers in black suits, guided by Jack, now inch toward the

podium.

USHER
Sir? Please?

Ben ignores them. He takes a piece of paper from his jacket.

BEN
I want to read you all something. So
you know what I mean. I found this
after her death. It's Leslie's Will.
And I quote, "In the event of her
death, Leslie Abigail Cash, as a
Buddhist, wishes to be cremated. Her
funeral, such as it is, shall be a
celebration of the life-cycle, with
music and dancing. After, it is her
expressed desire that her ashes shall
be taken to a nondescript location,
preferably public and heavily
populated so as to be utterly
unremarkable. At which point her
ashes, promptly and unceremoniously,
are to be flushed down the nearest
toilet." End quote.

Ben looks up at the mourners.

BEN (CONT'D)
Now THAT's comedy.

The ushers rush Ben. He resists, but there are too many men
for Ben to fight and he is overpowered.

Jack looks up to find Ben, not three feet away.

Only now does Jack see the kids. In an instant, he softens,
bending down to embrace his grandchildren.

JACK
Come here, guys. I’ve missed you all
so much. Come here.

He and Abigail wade into the kids. Abigail looks dazed. Or
severely medicated.

Hmm. For a girl her age, she's

We have seven vertebrae in the neck.

full-body, hardcore functional training routine: they’re all
shouting orders at him, teaching him how to move from lunges
to Burpies into Plank.

JACK
Why is this called a Burpie? Am I
supposed to burp?

Nai finds this hilarious.
NAI

No! Because it makes you want to
vomit! If you do them enough.

The enormous garage is filled with all kinds of athletic

golf carts.

Abigail is on the floor of the garage, fishing around in a
cardboard box. She passes a photograph to Ben.

It is a photograph of Leslie at her High School Prom. She has
a bleached blonde streak in her hair, frosted eyeliner, and
both her dress and her date's tuxedo are the height of 1980s
fashion.

ABIGAIL
That boy, what was his name? Dean?
Derek?

BEN

Dirk. Dirk Modzelewski.
ABIGAIL

Ben looks at Abigail, not sure whether or not to laugh.
Abigail smiles and they both crack up.

pond.

Rellian fires and hits two ducks. Immediately after he fires,
analysis appears on the screen: hit position, gun swing,
changing flight velocity, entry of target trajectory.

Look at that! We'll make a marksman

RELLIAN

Rellian beams.

See how when you stop your swing,

Vespyr and Kielyr walk into the kitchen of a funky house: the
furniture appears second hand, the walls are all painted
different colors, kid's drawings cover the walls.

The place is also cluttered with string and tape, hanging
found objects creating bizarre sculptures; bicycles,
skateboards, musical instruments, and toys cover every
surface.

VESPYR
We have to buy more feed.

CONTINUED: 149

KIELYR
We only have enough for another two
days or so.

The twins pass Ben and sit at the breakfast room table. They
fix themselves bowls of cereal and immediately fall into
reading their books.

BEN
You both finish the "Madame Bovary"
book report?

KIELYR
Plus Mr. Grant let us do "The Tin
Drum" for extra credit.

VESPYR
That shit is intense.

Now Rell, Zaja, and Nai come in, each carrying a basket of
freshly picked vegetables: broccoli, mesclun, romaine
lettuce, peas, green beans, and squash.

BEN
Bus is here in 10.

They put the vegetable baskets on the counter - next to the
their school backpacks - and sit down to eat breakfast. They
also all read or work on their homework.

Ben takes the lunch he’s made for his five kids - peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches and apples - and places them into
paper bags.

He sets them out on the counter, each bag identified with
their name. He stares at the lunch bags for a moment.

Then he breaks some broccoli into stalks and places a piece
in each bag.

Ben sits down next to his kids, watching them eat.

Without looking up from his book, Rellian pours cereal and
milk into a bowl and passes it over to his dad.

Ben smiles.

And then - for an extended period of time - they all just
continue to eat in silence.

THE END.
