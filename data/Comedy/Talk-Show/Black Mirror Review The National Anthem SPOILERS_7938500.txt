INT. DOWNING STREET BEDROOM - NIGHT 1

 

It’s very dark in here. Virtually the only thing we can make
out is a double bed with a couple slumbering beneath a duvet.
Beside the bed, a Blackberry thrums into life, on vibrate.

From the bed, a man’s hand blearily reaches for the
Blackberry, but manages instead to knock it onto the carpet,
where it continues to thrum away. He grunts slightly. The
Blackberry stops humming. For a moment, all is quiet again.

Then another phone rings: an office desk phone, beside the
bed. Sighing, he reaches over and switches on a lamp. Now we
see him: Michael Callow: early forties. His wife Jane rolls
over, pulls the covers up around her.

Glancing at the clock beside the bed (5.13am), Michael lifts
the receiver with a faintly resigned, apprehensive air.

MICHAEL
Hello.

He listens.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Just tell me what’s happened.

He listens. Whoever’s on the phone is saying something, but
not giving him the basics: what is happening?

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
What is it?

The voice on the other end says something. Something that
wakes him up. His face drains of what little colour the night
had left it with.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
I'll be right down.

He hangs up and sits, slightly stunned, for a moment. Jane
has woken up herself. She touches his arm to comfort him.

JANE
What’s happened?

MICHAEL
(staring into space)
Susannah.

JANE
Susannah?

MICHAEL
Princess Susannah.

He rips back the bedclothes and reaches for a dressing gown.

JANE
Is she alright?

Michael heads for the door.
MICHAEL

I don’t know.

INT. DOWNING STREET BRIEFING ROOM — NIGHT 2

 

A large oak panelled room. Prime Minister Michael Callow sits
at a large conference room table, a coffee in front of him,
still in his dressing gown.

We hear muted sobs. Female. Coming from a speaker. But for
now, we’re watching the people in this room. It’s a COBRA
meeting. Aside from Michael there are four others present.
Sitting to his right: Alex Cairns, Home Secretary, in her
early 50s, smartly dressed. Also present: Julian Hereford, DG
of MI5 -- also smartly dressed.

Standing at the back of the room, Director of Communications
Tom Bilce, in trendy specs.

There’s also a steely looking man in his mid-30s: Section
Chief Walker, also MI5, standing by a plasma screen which is
currently demanding everyone’s attention. The screen from
which the sobs are emanating. It’s hooked up to a laptop in
front of Julian.

On screen, an attractive woman in her 20s. Mascara running
down her face. Cut-glass accent. We only see her from the
shoulders up: straps of a summer dress and fresh bruises.

It’s Princess Susannah. Clearly in great distress. Tied in
position, arms behind her back as far as we can tell. She
looks off to the side: there’s someone standing there, behind
the lens. Someone we can’t see.

SUSANNAH
Don’t kill me.

We see Michael’s ashen face, as he watches. Then back to the
screen as an electronic voice - one of the standard ones
included with modern laptops - speaks, off-mic, to the
Princess.

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Read the statement.

SUSANNAH
Please don’t kill me.

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Read the statement.
Black Mirror 'The National Anthem' - Pink Script - 1/8/2011 - 3.

SUSANNAH
Yes... all right. From that screen?

There is a slight pause: we hear brief typing.

ELECTRONIC VOICE
That is correct.

Susannah looks down the lens, and starts to read, like an
amateur presenter having to read an autocue at gunpoint. At
times hesitant... at times stuttering on her own terror.

SUSANNAH
I am Susannah, Duchess of
Beaumont... popularly known as
Princess Susannah. I am somewhere
you cannot find, held by someone
you will not trace.

She pauses, peers at the next bit.

SUSANNAH (CONT'D)
Prime Minister Michael Callow...

We see Michael blanche at the direct mention of his name.

SUSANNAH (CONT'D)

Prime Minister Michael Callow... My
life... my life depends on you.
If you do not do precisely as
instructed by 4pm this afternoon, I
will be...

(she sobs)
I will be executed. Oh God I c--

Abruptly, Julian taps the spacebar on the laptop -- the video *

pauses. *
MICHAEL
What are you doing? Keep it going.
JULIAN
Prime Minister, at this point it’s
important to say we are 100 percent
certain this is indeed Princess Susannah.
Her car was intercepted shortly after
midnight. Returning from the wedding of
one of her student friends.
MICHAEL opens his mouth -- Alex Cairns speaks for the first *
time. She’s looking down though, at the table. *
ALEX *
She'd insisted on going.
MICHAEL
(to JULIAN)

But you had security on her, I mean-
Black Mirror 'The National Anthem' - Pink Script - 1/8/2011 -

WALKER
Two PPOs; still unconscious.
MICHAEL
Unconscious?
WALKER

Heavy sedative, close range, each
with a single puncture wound, no
sign of struggle.

Michael gestures at the screen, dazed.

MICHAEL
What do they want, money?

No-one says anything.

Beat.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Release a jihadi? Scrap 3rd world
debt?

(exasperated by silence)
Save the fucking libraries?

JULIAN
We believe both the video and the
demand it contains to be genuine.

MICHAEL
(shouting)
What demand?

ALEX
What Susannah says next... it
concerns you directly sir.

Michael stares at her. Looks round at all of them. None
his aides are making eye contact. He’s worked alongside Alex
and Tom for three years. Now they won’t look at him.

Julian is also looking at the table.

This already bad situation just took a lurch towards
nightmarish. Callow looks at Walker, who is regarding him
with a glimmer of sympathy.

WALKER
This is actually happening sir.

MICHAEL
(quieter)
Just play it.

Julian hits his keyboard. The video resumes.

of
Black Mirror 'The National Anthem' - Pink Script - 1/8/2011 - 5.

SUSANNAH
«-. can’t... please... I don’t want
to die.

She dissolves into sobs. We hear fast off-camera typing.

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Continue to read the statement.

Susannah looks back at the lens.

SUSANNAH
There is only one demand. And it is
a simple one. At 4pm this afternoon
Prime Minister Michael Callow must
appear on live television, on all
British networks -- terrestrial and
satellite -- and... no.

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Continue to read the statement --

SUSANNAH
«+. on all British networks,
terrestrial and satellite -- and
have full unsimulated sexual
intercourse with a pig.
(sob; looks offscreen)
I don’t understand.

Julian pauses the recording again, just as a list of
instructions appears.

JULIAN
The video ends with a series of technical
specifications for the broadcast.

We watch MICHAEL’s face register 500 bewilderments at once.
He tries to speak. Nothing. He almost laughs. Then thinks
again. He looks around: no-one makes eye contact. Finally:

MICHAEL
Why are you doing this?
(beat)
It’s a joke, right? Ha ha Mike. Ho

ho.
There is more silence.

JULIAN
It’s real.

Michael stares at the table. Then back at the screen. Then at
Alex, his confidant.

MICHAEL
Did she say “pig”? Sex with a pig.
Black Mirror 'The National Anthem' - Pink Script - 1/8/2011 - 6.

Alex nods.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
They want me to have sex with a pig?

TOM

On live television this afternoon.
MICHAEL

But what -- who the--
WALKER

We're checking with our embedded
operatives, compiling suspects as
we speak.

ALEX
Meanwhile, the demand has been made
and there’s not long to formulate
our response.

MICHAEL
Well I’m not fucking a pig. Page
one, that’s not happening.

ALEX
Of course.

He looks around. Alex nods. Tom nods. Julian nods. Walker's
face doesn’t react at first. Until Michael looks at him.

WALKER
Absolutely sir.

MICHAEL
(to Julian)
Have we established a dialogue with
this... person?

JULIAN
We can’t. There’s no email address,
no codeword, no channel for
negotiation. Almost certainly a
deliberate stance.

Michael stands up again. He’s pacing now, trying to think:

MICHAEL
Okay. So. We focus on finding
Susannah, get her back, however it’s
done, I don’t care, we stop this now.

ALEX
I assure you everyone is working
toward this.
Black Mirror 'The National Anthem' - Pink Script - 1/8/2011 -

MICHAEL
Yes -- no! Not everyone! Dedicated
core team. This can’t go wide.

He looks at Tom Bilce.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
And keep it so far from the press
it’s on the other side of Jupiter.

Tom opens his mouth awkwardly.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
It only exists in this room.

TOM
It’s already outside it.

That’s another blow. Michael’s rattled by it:

MICHAEL
If there's hacks sniffing round,
shut them down.

Tom looks like he wants to say something.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Bright red D-notice. Super-fucking-
Godzilla-injunction with ten-inch
Whitehall fangs.

Before Tom can answer, Julian interjects.

JULIAN
This video came from YouTube.

Michael spins around, agape.

MICHAEL
What?

WALKER
It was uploaded via an encrypted IP
over an hour ago.

MICHAEL
Well get it off there!

JULIAN
We did, after nine minutes. But
that was long enough for it to be
downloaded, duplicated, and spread.

MICHAEL
Spread? How many people have seen
this?
Black Mirror 'The National Anthem' - Pink Script - 1/8/2011 - 8.

JULIAN
We take one down, six clones pop up
elsewhere. It’s viral.

MICHAEL
How many people?

WALKER
50,000. That’s our current estimate.

Michael is silenced as that unfurls in his head. Then:

TOM
The newsrooms have got it.

MICHAEL
(alarm)
They're running this on air?

ALEX
No. We put a type five D-notice out
immediately, and they’re complying.

TOM
For now.

Michael’s spooked. Alex shoots Tom a look: not helpful.
TOM (CONT'D)
(ominously)
It’s trending on Twitter.

Michael looks at the screen, once again struck dumb. He looks
around the room; he might cry. Then he thumps the table hard.

MICHAEL
FUCKING INTERNET!

ALEX
(calmly)
Well, yes.

MICHAEL
So now what? What’s the playbook?

JULIAN
It’s new territory, Prime Minister.
There is no playbook.
Michael looks more puce than ever. Rubs his eyes.

MICHAEL
Christ.

This is a bedroom belonging to a young couple.

The male half, Kieran, sleeps in bed. His girlfriend Lauren
isn’t here yet.

The door bursts open. It’s Lauren his girlfriend, dressed for

On the table a laptop shows the Princess Susannah video.

A debate is in full flow. Doing most of the talking are: two
reporters, Malaika (female, attractive, late 20s) and Damon
(late 30s). Outranking them are Shelly, Day Editor (late 30s)

round the corner, Tom Bilce on the phone. Tom looks furious,
but daren’t raise his voice too much.

On the walls: the occasional framed shot of celebs and
gameshows. This place is commonly used for mainstream TV.

A besuited special agent named CALLETT -- Government type,
about 35, is on the move toward the studio, flanked by two
armed special officers. They pass a corridor -- CALLETT
quickly points down it.

CALLETT
Harper, any doors down there,
secure them.

One of the officers obediently peels off to stride down the
corridor. CALLETT and the remaining officer keep moving.

A paunchy producer in his mid-40s called JON appears from
another corridor, chaperoning NOEL, a youngish FX guy with a
flashy Alienware laptop under his arm.

JON
Mr. Callett? Noel from Blue Eye.

With a glance, CALLETT sizes him up. Noel is about 24; a bit
alternative, in a T-shirt with retro videogame art on it.

This is Tom Bilce’s little fiefdom. Computer monitors, and
two big tellies at the side. One is tuned to UKN News.

TOM and CAMILLA enter.

CAMILLA
The Sun’s site runs with ‘TAKEN’;
big grab of Susannah, mentions the
demand euphemistically...

It’s a poky room, with desks, and three young assistants in
their twenties. One of whom is the quiet, faintly nerdy
assistant called ANDREW we saw in a corridor earlier. He’s
currently on the phone, speaking slightly in code.

ANDREW

Of course I still want that drink.

MALAIKA looks at her phone and thinks.

Andrew's Blackberry thrums once more. He looks at it. A
picture of Malaika -- cut off just below the shoulders. It
looks like she’s naked, even though she isn’t.

He checks no-one’s looking over his shoulder. Looks at the

photo again. And he puts the phone back in his pocket. But
now he’s on a slightly different plane, somehow.

A commotion; someone trying to enter. A security guard trying

He touches her neck; she pushes his hand away. He touches it

She pushes his hand away, but doesn’t really want to. He puts
it back, cradling her head.

WAROUQ who speaks with a bit of an ‘innit’ tone.

On the other side of the studio is a man standing roughly in

CALLET stands behind Noel -- upon Noel’s laptop we see an

35 EXT. BANKSIDE STUDIOS - DAY 1 35

An official-looking car pulls to a halt outside the TV
complex. A waiting officer opens the rear door. Out steps a
humourless besuited civil servant called BROWNE, closely
followed by a rather goonish-looking lanky man in his early
forties, with longish hair and a gold necklace.

He’s Colin Flynn, better known by his ‘screen name’ ROD
SENSELESS. A porn star ala Ben Dover, in mid-conversation
with BROWNE. A one-sided talk: BROWNE is trying to ignore
him.

ROD
It’s a new one for me, obviously, cos
it’s illegal. I wouldn’t normally,
y'know. Have you seen my stuff?

BROWNE
No.

ROD
Well I’m pretty trad. Bish bash

but I'd be lying.

That usually gets a laugh. Not now.
ROD (CONT'D)
Yeah, well. What do I put on the
invoice, that’s what I’m wondering?
BROWNE
(trying not to sigh)
There won't be any invoicing.

During this last exchange, a SPARK unloading equipment from
his truck spots Rod, and holds up a cameraphone.

SPARK
Oy oy Rod!

Rod does a cheeky thumbs up as the spark take a snap --
BROWNE impatiently hurries him toward the entrance. The
pedestrian walks off, fiddling with his phone...

terrorism head.

SIR HAROLD (V.O.)
I can't think of anything even
remotely similar to this - it's an
entirely new form of terrorism (the
point of which I can't begin to
understand)

MEHDI
If this is terrorism it's not

computer analyst called JAMIE.

MICHAEL
“I trust you’1l do everything in

It wasn’t a collective ‘you’, it

MICHAEL
Easy to be confident when it’s not

nervous when the PM approaches -- he is the Prime Minister

curious indeed. He flips it open. His face recoils with

him away, and Michael ends up sitting slumped on the carpet,
properly tearful now. Alex, shocked, adjusting herself. Her
hair messed.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
(almost childlike)
What did you do Alex?

ALEX

I had a back-up plan. A man
prepared to do it, and an FX
company that’d paint your head onto
his shoulders.

(readjusting his collar)
Plan was to broadcast as instructed
-- reputation destroyed -- then
announce the truth once we got her
back. Reputation restored.

62 I/E. UKN NEWS PACKAGE - DAY 1. 62

We come in halfway through a UKN News report fronted by
DAMON, the reporter from earlier.

Archive shot of the door of Number 10 Downing Street. A still
of the PM, and a Pie Chart depicting a statistic. OR DAMON
OUTSIDE DOWNING STREET.

DAMON (V.O.)
Just a few hours ago public opinion
was behind Prime Minister Callow,
with only 8% of the public
believing he should fulfill the
bizarre and illegal request.

Then shots of the ‘finger’ video, and a still photo of the
finger -- close up on the ring, with graphic bits pixellated
out.

DAMON (V.O.)
But in the wake of these images and the
delivery of the Princess’s severed
finger to UKN, the mood is shifting.

At which point it cuts to more vox pops. Busy London street.

First up, a female shopper in her early 50s. Middle class
type.

SHOPPER
It'd be humiliating but it’s
nothing compared to her suffering.

DAMON (0.S.)
So you think Mr. Callow should
comply with the demand?

SHOPPER
Well I don’t see what choice he has.
Black Mirror 'The National Anthem' - Pink Script - 1/8/2011 - 43.

Hard yet sloppy news-style cut: to a Doncaster couple in
their early forties, out in London for the day. The woman's a
bit more outgoing than the man.

DONCASTER WOMAN
He’s got to do it. He’s just got to
do it.

DONCASTER MAN
He’s got to.

DONCASTER WOMAN
It’s a woman’s life.

Then we cut again: next vox pop is from a late-forties cab
driver. A bit Talksport.

CABBIE
I won't watch but if Callow don’t
do it, he’s letting that girl die.
To save his own dignity, right? But
how much dignity is he gonna have,
with the whole country knowing he
could've saved her?

At this point we cut to...

Without speaking she sneaks back toward the wire fence.

The strike team is in position around the building. Either
side of a door. One soldier hunched down beneath a broken

window. Waiting for Walker to give a signal. Which he does.

Foom - the hunched soldier bungs a flashbang through the
broken window. Bright white light and smoke: they storm in.

Lots of excitable chatter from customers. The odd gag, the
occasional sharp word. Tension and excitement.

SONIA is serving drinks. There’s a blackboard behind the bar
with various odds chalked up. Stuff like ‘PM VOMITS - 4/1’

We've ratified the law. After
midnight, it’s a criminal offence

from a post-broadcast statement he has prepared.

“Michael Callow has displayed
incredible bravery in what was
literally a matter of life or
death.” That’s how we open, then we
move on to --

Michael puts a hand up: stop.

Outside the car, Alex is whispering with CALLETT

cup back.

shaking off BROWNE, following the PM

Alright -- your body, your
corporeal form, it’s an extension
of you, but it’s not you. It’s not

head)
Everything else is out here where
it can’t touch you. All of this is
miles away. And you can travel
further, in your head. Fly into

to find a body close to the lens, apparently twisting as
though suspended. It’s in paint-spattered overalls. One of
the hands has a severed, bandaged stump in place of a finger.

In the background we can see a laptop. *
INT. NASH ARMS PUB - DAY 1 126

The faces have turned more solemn. Some look almost bored,

flat or sad. The place has thinned out a bit -- not a lot,

but a bit.

Even PIKE is looking morose. BRIAN glances at his watch and
back at the screen.

The pub has thinned out. The TV’s still on but everyone
watching it looks sad and drained. Haunted, almost.

There’s an expression playing across their faces -- a sort of
final pinch of disgust mixed with the end of a disappointing
goalless draw. One guy with a pint talking to his friend:

Outside, Alex waits with a couple of officers. The sound of

Suddenly Alex feels her phone vibrate. She answers it.

WALKER is in a hospital area; nurses etc. passing in b/g.

Susannah.

They released her?
She signals to Tom Bilce - gestures a thumbs up. Tom looks as
relieved as a man who’s just discovered the moon isn’t about
to crash into the planet after all.

Where?

That’s not all ma’am. She’d been

What do you mean, ‘some time’?

There’s a CCTV grab of her from

minutes before it happened.

Of course.

Good news Michael.

On the screen we cut to footage of Princess Susannah -- who

is now lightly pregnant and at a red carpet event.

DAMON
The other central figure in last
year’s events was also before the
cameras, at last night’s Children
of Valour awards; Princess Susannah
made her first public appearance
since announcing her pregnancy.

Slow zoom on still of the artist standing in his workshop. We
also see slow-mo footage of the artist from a Culture Show

episode, in slow mo, in his studio. This footage loops.

Bloom coerced the Prime Minister into
committing an indecent act with the
audacious kidnap.

DAMON (V.O.)

As the anniversary arrived, one art
critic has caused controversy by
describing it as the first great
artwork of the 21st Century.

Shot of a shaven-headed art critic with even twattier
glasses. A caption reads ‘GREGORY DYCE, Art in Review’

GREG
There’s no rule that says art must
be admirable or even enjoyable. The
best art often unsettles us, which
this certainly did. And of course
it was the single biggest artistic
collaboration in history, one in
which all of us took part.

Shot of Michael and his wife -- his arm around her waist --
waving to the cameras outside Number Ten, then going in.

DAMON (V.O.)

But while cultural commentators
debate its artistic worth, there’s
no denying the incident failed to
destroy a Prime Minister who
currently holds an approval rating
3 points higher than this time last
year. Damon Brown, UKN.

As he says this, Michael & Jane shut the door of Number Ten.

INT. NUMBER TEN ENTRANCE - DAY 2. 147
The door has just shut behind Michael and Jane. Her face goes
cold the moment the door shuts. She pushes his arm off her
and walks up the stairs. And he looks up at her, as she goes.
But she doesn’t look back.
