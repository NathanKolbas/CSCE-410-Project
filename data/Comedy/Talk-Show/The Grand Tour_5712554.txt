EXT. HIGHLANDS ABOVE SPOKANE -~ WINTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

A vision of a charcoal smudge against banked snow. Reveal the smucc?
to be a Darth Vader black jeep.

In the jeep, we catch spit-polisn black boots pressing the
accelerator. We follow up legs covered in fire proofed flignt-suit
khaki. We hover at a chest neutered by a flight jacket emplazoned
with lightning bolts clasped in a mailed fist. we travel past a name
Sag stenciled: MOREAU, to a moon-man white helmet framing the face
of a woman. A fresh scrubbed American face, with beautiful eyes and
awisp of dark hair.

The black jeep whines past us towards the main gate at Fairchild
aiz Force Base.

CLOSER -- FAIRCHILD MAIN GATE <=

A young airman, with only a blue beret to protect hia against the
morning colé, blows on his hands to keep them warm. He HEARS the
nigh pitched sound of the jeep approaching, smiles as he assumes

his proper position at the guard gate. .

All business now, the young airman returns MOREAU's salute. As she
passes through, she glances in her rear-view mirror and catches the
guards barely suppressed smile. Behind him a large sign reads:
CAUTION, YOU ARE NOW ENTERING THE MOST DANGEROUS AREA IN THE

WORLD <= THE AMERICAN HIGHWAY.

SXT. FAIRCHILD AIR FORCE BASE -- WASHINGTON STATE -- DAWN ~

MOREAU cruises through the base past rows of old barracks, then up
along the ridge above the flight line. Below her, stretched out in
a line and bathed in surreal pea~soup yellow lights, stand six
jungle camouflaged 8-52's. Ice mist wisps off their long drooping,
nuclear azmed wings.

EXT FAIRCHILD ALERT FACILITY -- DAWN --

MOREAU parks ner jeep and walks along the barbed wire cyclone fence
towards the half buried bunker-like ALERT FACILITY. Her breath
misting in the morning cold, she arrives at the first metal gace.

A sign reads: DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED.

MOREAU walks through the first gate and is momentarily trapped as it
closes behind her. A second gate does not open. She is
scrutinised, TV cameras whirring, sensors sensing. A loud electronic
CLICK and the second gate opens revealing a guard with loase slung
M16 on his shoulder, pearl handled pistol on his hip, and a beret.
He does not smile.

The guard runs a metal detector up and down the inside of MOREAU's
legs. Cleared, she now walks up the ramp towards the facility where
she will pull a week cf standby nuclear alert cuty.
INT. GAME ROOM -- ALERT FACILITY -
EXTREME CLOSEUP ~- KAZAKLIS'S FACE

He is intensely concentrating. The eyes however, belie a late night
at the bar of the High. Pine Lounge from which he has too recently
come.

EXTREME CLOSEQP -~- KAZAKLIS'S FINGERS -

We HEAR KAZAKLIS's voice send light speed signals to his fingers.
We HEAR the electronic blip every time the FIRE button is pushed
followed by an electronic explosion sound. The fingers deftly
follow each command.

. KAZAKLIS (v.o.)

Left ten, fire (blip); left five,
fire (blip); Left five, fize (blip).
Right ten, fire (blip); Right ten,
fire (blip).

CLOSEUP -- SPACE INVADERS ELECTRONIC ARCADE GAME SCREEN

Two more invaders move steadily down towards the bottom of the
screen where the electronic spaceship lies in wait.

KAZAKLIS (v.0.)
Lef: five, fire! Left five, fire
(blip, blip).

INT. GAME ROOM -- ALERT FACILITY

XAZAKLIS pushes back from the controls of the Space Invaders game
as it plays a little electronic victory song. He smiles. He is
good. He has to be. He is the best pilot and the worst example in
the Strategic Air Command.

The game room looks like early Holiday Inn. Cinder-block walls, pool
tables, card tables, chairs and sofas. A window framed with curtains
that, upon closer examination, is net a real window at all but

merely a realistic mural of a desert scene drawn in 3-D perspective.

MOREAU enters with a rolled up flight plan map and sits down next

to HALUPALAI, the big Hawaiian tail gunner, the oldest of the crew
and the only NCO, Halupalai is staring eff into space, out the fake
desert window.

Moreau spreads a flight plan map on the card table. It shows a B-52
heading north toward Russia. Then it makes a sudden loop and a
bee-line for Tahiti.

MOREAU
Well...

(CONTINUED)
co

CONTINUED:
HALOPALAIL
Tahiti's now a strategic target,
Captain?
MOREAU

I thought it would make an
interesting conversation piece the
next time the base commander brings
a visiting Senator by.

HALUPALAI
(laughs) Only you could get away with
that.

Moreau looks at Kazaklis wno is back playing Space Invaders. His
butt sways left then right; he is whistling “America the Beautiful".
Moreau turns back to Halupalai and gives him a wicked grin. She
rolls up her map and walks up behind Kazaklis. She Pauses. His butt
is still swaying left and right and he's whistling "..for amber
waves of grain..." :

MOREAU
Captain...

KAZAKLIS
Not now Moreau.

Another pause. The butt still swaying to the rhythm of the machine. _
The whistling even louder. Then in quick cuts:

-She jams her rolled up map between Kazaklis' legs.
-The green alien adversary on the screen lets go with a blast.
-Kazaklis explodes simultaneously with the machine.

KAZAKLIS
She-e-e-e-it

Tne video screen flashes: GAME OVER, GAME OVER, GAME OVER...
EXT. CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN -- COLORADO -=- DUSK

We are high OVERLOOKING skiers schussing down Powdery slopes. A
title aspears: NORAD : CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, COLORADO. As it
disappears we move DOWN. DOWN past the skiers, into the snow. DOWN,
DOWN, DOWN into the mountain's bowels. Continuing down we emerge
into a dank tunnel whose black walls weep moisture.

INT. CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN -- TUNNEL

We come to rest behind a GENERAL who is standing in wait for a 25
ten steel door to finish opening. The General begins to move forward
towards a Styxian city and we move with him.

INT. CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN -~ COMMAND BALCONY AND OPERATIONS ROOM

The General emerges onto the glassed-in command balcony overlooking
a room Zilied with men peering into green screens.

The screens are powered by computers linked to orbiting satellites.
The satellites are tuned to Russian Steppes as well as to silent
rectangular boxes which represent yankee class soviet submarines
that have been tracked under the seas.

There are many clocks in the room tuned to Moscow, Omaha, Plesetsk,
Kapustin Yar, Washington, and the universal time of Zulu (Greenwich
meantime)

There are signs that ask: ARE YOU EWO READY? And there are alert
codes that read in order of readiness: APPLE JACK, LEMON JUICE,
SNOWMAN, BIG NOISE, COCKED PISTOL, FAST PACE, ROUND HOUSE,
DOUBLE TAKE, FADE OUT.

Watching all the watchers watching, stands the General. Below nim
a CANADIAN RAF OFFICER fiddles with his screen that has boxed the
rough location of a soviet sub 175 miles off the coast of Neah Bay,
Washington. On the sound of a blip we go to:

INT. ALERT FACILITY -- MOREAU'S DORM ROOM == PAIRCHILD AFB--

The door opens revealing a medieval chastity belt stretched across
it as Moreau enters. Sprawled across the second of two bunks is a
woman tanker pilot doing a crossword puzzle.

MOREAU
oo Hi

ROOMMATE
...Hmmmm.

Moreau crosses to her bunk and begins co unroll and tack up the
flight plan map we saw her with earlier. After a moment the roommate
looks up from her crossword puzzle.

ROOMMATE
You know, you're really pushing it,
Moreau.

Moreau continues tacking up her map, paying no attention. The
Roommate stands now, annoyed.

ROOMMATE
OK, if the map goes up then that
(pointing) has got to come down.

The toommate is pointing a mock centerfold of EDWARD TELLER in
living color with a small photograph of a mushroom cloud planted
squarely between his scrawny legs.

MOREAU
What have you got against the
ultimate climax dear?
 

INT. CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN -- COMMAND BALCONY AND OPERATIONS ROOM

The young RAF officer is tapping his screen in agitation. Three
more blips have appeared from the same zone off Neah Bay. Next to
him a young AMERICAN LIEUTENANT watches in fascination, distracted
from his own screen.

Blip. Suddenly out of the corner of his eye he catches a spasm
appear on his own screen which is trained on a patch of ocean in
the Georgia Banks off New England.

Blip. On another screen more blips appear of North Carolina and on
another a stacatto blip appears in the Pacific beyond Catalina in
Southern California.

The general watches patiently from above. He pushes a button
changing the’ alert code from APPLE JACK to LEMON JUICE. He starts
to reach for a phone, then draws back.

GENERAL
(to Aide) Check and make sure
someone hasn't slipped a training
tape into the main computer bank.

Another computer screen and a watcher is flipping his sereen on and
off then pulling the picture in tight for magnification. The screen
shows flexing molars like computer game aliens near Plesetsk in the
arctic north of Moscow. The words SILO DOORS OPENING flash in a
corner of the screen.

The General flicks the alert code from LEMON JUICE to SNOW MAN as
you really begin to feel the electricity.

AIDE
There is no training tape in the
computer, sir.

The General reaches to nis right to pick up the diréet line shone.
GENERAL
I'm calling SAC headquarters.

INT. LIBRARY -- ALERT FACILITY -- FAIRCHILD AFB --

The library is cramped and overheated. ARE YOU EWO READY? signs
are here too. TYLER, a 28 year old navigator is upset ané
preoccupied, yet still trying to comprehend the complexities of
David Stockman's "The Supply Side of Economics". TYLER stares off
into the bright white light of the bulb on the desk lamp which
becomes:

EXT. ALERT FACILITY ANNEX -- FAIRCHILD AFB -- DAY ~-

Winter white snow and then: Swings, a jungle gym and a slide. We
see Tyler playing with his three year old son. Tyler's wife comes
into the scene. She must reluctantly take the child and go. Tyler
to0ks after them for a moment then turns toward the Alert Facility.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

The mother suddenly screams. Tyler turns to see his boy running
towards him. Tyler angrily places his hands on his hips.

The boy freezes uncertainly. He turns to see his mother racing
after him. The boy bolts away from both parents towards the
¢rooping wings of the B-52's.

The boy slips on the frozen tarmac and skids near a wheel. The
mother is running after him. WHOMP. She falls hard. The air
rushes out of her, a foot ig placed firmly on her back, a riot gun
inches from her head. A second white form dees the same to the
child. They are the security patrol in winter white camouflage
suits. They have appeared from nowhere.

Tyler understands and moves slowly towards them.

TYLER,
-.-Cottonmouth.

The foot comes off the boy first. The woman more slowly. Tyler
picks up the boy and spanks him. The boy's eyes fill with tears.
Tyler hands him back to his mother and says tonelessly:

TYLER
You do not go near the bombs.

His wife's stricken eyes say nothing and everything.
INT. LIBRARY -- ALERT FACILITY -- FAIRCHILD AFS

CLOSE ON Tyler's eyes a little tear near one corner. He looks back
at his texthook and tries to concentrate again.

INT. SAC HEADQUARTERS --— OMAHA

A SAC four star Air Force GENERAL (GENERAL BLUE) cradles a phone.
He is listening to the two star General from Cheyenne but as we
watch, the light on his face changes from white Fluorescent to pale
luminous blue. Red lights like tracer bullets race across his
forehead.

BLUE GENERAL
Okay, I've put us on a combat
footing. Let's scramble the fighters
to take a lock-see.

We now begin to REVEAL the command balcony at SAC headquarters,

The General hangs up the phone. He sits in an overstuffed leather
chair in front of other phones and buttons. Below are some smaller
screens like at Cheyenne but the room is deminated by six 16' x 16'
screens at eye level with the command balcony. The General jabs

at some controls,

BLUE GENERAL
Let's get the big picture up there.

The main screen flutters briefly in a televideo snowstorm and then
up pops a large polar map looking down on the northern hemisphere.
The other screens show our missile installations, 3-52 bases, and
navy subs, The General shudders. On the center screen, out of the
flexing molars near PLESETSK come snaking white lines with computer
projections of missiles.k All of them cross American coast lines.
The General moves the status from SNOWMAN to BIG NOISE.

BLUE GENERAL
We've going from preliminary attack
conference to attack conference.
Get RSIOP off line. I want the SIOP
computer concentrating solely on this
problem -~ Now!

The General now reaches for a grungy yellow phone.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITTING ROOM/SAC HEADQUARTERS -- INTERCUT

A man in bathrobe and pajamas is asleep in an antique wing back
chair. A reerun of Mission Impossible plays on the TV. Ina groggy
and slurred voice the man answers.

PRESIDENT
«Yes? ~ ~

BLUE GENERAL
(aside) Jee-zuz...Mr. President,
we face an extremely serious
situation. I have asked for a full
attack conference. Under my
authority I am about to move us from
BIG NOISE to COCKED PISTOL.

PRESIDENT
+«eBIG PISTOL?

. BLOE GENERAL
Mr. President, I know you are
upstairs but the line is secure.

PRESIDENT
Who is this?

BLUE GENERAL
Icarus.

A long, long pause.

BLUE GENERAL
Icarus, yes. Mr. President, is your
EWO there?

PRESIDENT

BLUE GENERAL
The man with the black briefcase
outside your bedroom, Mr. President.

INT. CAFETERIA -- ALERT FACILITY -- FAIRCHILD AFB

RADNOR, a tadar operator in his 20's enters the almost empty
cafeteria, He's sweaty after his workout. He's in gym clothes but
his flight suit from which he is never separated, is draped over
his arm. He waves to his WIFE, an Air Force cop, then glides his
tray down a stainless steel counter where the menu reads: Donut
l¢, pie 5¢, Blue plate special 35¢. He chooses a donut and bounces
a single penny off the counter top before approaching his wife.

RADNOR
Hey, this chow'’s the best deal in
town. All you have to do is work
a 168 hour week without overtime.

She smiles and shows him the base newspaper, the GEIGER ALERT.

| WIFE
Did you see this?

The headline reads: A DOOMSDAY ROMANCE -- FINDING LOVE BY THE
MEGATON. The article includes a wedding picture of the smiling
couple.

RADNOR
Hey I don't mind. They always raz
the career guys. Once the Air Force
let you transfer here, man, I don't
care what they say.

They hold hands and moon at each other.

RADNOR :
You got duty tonight? -

She bites her lip and shakes her head yes.

RADNOR
Well, that still gives us a little
time to play Mountie and- the Squaw.
Let me hit the shower first.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITTING ROOM/SAC HEADQUARTERS -- INTERCUT

PRESIDENT
Sorry, General, you caught me half
asleep. Wife's off in Connecticut
christening a ship.

BLUE GENERAL
You need your EWO immediately, sir.

PRESIDENT
What seems to be the problem?

BLUE GENERAL
Mz. President, we are in the
secondary stages of a major attack,
probably a counterforce variation.
SIOP is analyzing it now. Our
defenses show a swarm attack by
submarines almost certainly Soviet,
and a random attack by land based
ICBM's, certainly Soviet. We need
your authority.

The President stares at Mission Impossible for a moment.

PRESIDENT
Defenses, The computers again, huh?
General, may I be candid with you,
this is a shitty way to get a new
set of computers.

BLUE GENERAL
Siz!

PRESIDENT
How many times since I became
President have those damn machines
screwed up? How many times have they
screwed up so badly we have gone to
attack conferences? Five? Six?

BLUE GENERAL
-And how many times have I picked up
this telephone, Mr. President? We
have no time for this, sir. We need
your authority. This is real. This
is Pearl Harbor.

PRESIDENT
I don't believe it. I talked to the
Russian ambassador today.

BLUE GENERAL

I'm talking to SIOP. I trust him
more.

CONTINUED:

PRESIDENT
And what is your computerized advisor
telling you, General? You woke me
up at one in the morning with this
ctap. What is SIOP telling you?
Your career may be riding on it.

BLOE GENERAL
My career, siz?

The General looks at the screen in front of him, watching the white
lines snake further from Plesetsk. He sees one of the side screens
spewing out data. [It shows one of the missiles achieving
sub-orbital flight over the Arctic Ocean and the margin of error

on the missile's trajectory is instantly reduced. The General's
voice becomes brittle.

BLUE GENERAL
Stop is telling me that a Soviet
SS-18, carrying 2.5 to 5 megatons,
has my name on it. Mr. President,
SIOP is telling me my career will
be over in twenty-two minutes. I'm
also being told that a submarine
launched missile has MIRV'd near
Richmond. One of its multiple
warheads, carrying 40 kilotons, is
directed in the vicinity of .
Washington; ... Strange, that. So
small.,.SIOP says the odds are 50-50
the target is the White House, 30
70 Andrews Air Force Base. [It will
arrive in seven minutes, sir.

The President looks up to see his EWO (Emergency War Orders
Officer). He is the man with the "football", the black briefcase
with the codes to start a nuclear war. The EWO flicks off "Mission
Impossible" on the TV. Behind him the APPOINTMENTS SECRETARY and
SEDGEWICK, the Duty Officer come hurriedly through the door.

INT. SHOWERS AND LOCKER ROOM == ALERT FACILITY -~ FAIRCHILD
ArS .

Water pelts O'TOOLE, the yeung B-52d Electronic Warfare Officer,
with a thousand Lilliputian fingers. His Gulliver's hand pummels
Ivory soap turning it into a froth that invades every bodily
crevice. He feels good. As he works the Ivory into the warmth at
the top of his thighs he feels a familiar pleasure.

RADNOR (0.s.)}
O'Toole!

O'Toole's spongy knees snap into near lock-joint.

RADNOR (0.s.)
Cleanliness may be next to Godliness,
you Mick prick, but you can't stay
in the shower all night.

O'Toole relaxes. Radnor hadn't seen. Radnor begins to unlace his
sneakers.

O'TOOLE
Don't try anything funny, Radnor.
One of my best friends is a security
cop here and she'd just love to get
a couple of hot shot SAC airmen on
lewd behavior.

Radnor laughs. oO'Tocle lets the shower spray down the soap. Then
he turns the hot water OFF and the cold water ON FULL te get a real
jar of stimulation.

EXT./INT. WHITE HOUSE SITTING ROOM/SAC HEADQUARTERS

Winking red eyes become tiny Orwellian orbs at the top of the
Washington Monument lit up at night. We are PULLING BACX through
the Sitting Room window. The President is gripping the phone and
Staring at the file his EWO has spread before him. ‘The Appointments
Secretary places a hand on the Presidential shoulder, squeezing
slightly, seeming to nudge. The President looks around him, he
feels alone.

PRESIDENT
The Secretary of Defense is not here.
The Secretary of State is not here.
The head of the National Security
Council is not here.

BLUE GENERAL
They will not be there, siz. We
anticipated this. SIOP has
accounted for it.

PRESIDENT
A decision of this magnitude...

BLUE GENERAL .
We've been through this before, siz.
You don't have to make those
decisions. The SIOP computer will
make those decisions. We need your
authority. In the codes. In the
EWO's briefcase.

PRESIDENT
SIOP will make those decisions, a
goddamned computer?

ae,

CONTINUED:

BLUE GENERAL
The goddamn computer has twenty-one
minutes, six. You have less than
seven. Mr. President, we have placed
all the options, determined by the
best human brains of two generations
in SIOP. The Russian options are
in RSIOP. It's all there, even, I
am sure, this rather strange attack
sequence.

PRESIDENT
o-- Strange? .

BLUE GENERAL
We're wasting time, sir. Your time.

Sedgewick, the Duty Officer who's been on a second telephone looks
up plaintively.

SEDGEWICK
A message is arriving on the direct
teletype from the Soviet Premiere,

PRESIDENT
Did you hear that, General?

BLUE GENERAL
Yes, sir. Nastygram on the hotline.
Shrewd buggers, aren't they?

PRESIDENT
What is your super brain telling you
now about the Premiere's earlier
message for me?

BLUE GENERAL
Six minutes twenty seconds to impact.
Trajectory still uncertain. Wobbling
slightly. Forty kilotons. Ground
burst likely. 10-90 probability on
Andrews. Still 50-50 on the White
House.

The President stiffens now, sensing something SIOP never would.
He places both palms against his forehead, runs his fingers through
his haiz.
PRESIDENT
I'm going downstairs to read that
message.

BLUE GENERAL
You're what?

PRESIDENT
I'm going to see that telegram,

Mr. President, you are playing with
the fate of millions.

PRESIDENT
That's how I earn my 200 thou, General.

BLUE GENERAL
They're mousetrapping you.

PRESIDENT
We'll see. :

The President hangs up. We stay with the Blue General at SAC
Headquarters,

BLUE GENERAL
Get me Alice in the Looking Glass Plane.

The Blue General looks around for his Number Two, a Navy man. His
code name is HARPOON.

BLUE GENERAL
Time to go, Admiral. We need at
least two command planes up.

HARPOON
The Navy doesn't like to abandon
ship, General.

: BLUE GENERAL
This is my ship. Yours is the £4,
The country's going to need you and
Alice up there when we're gone.

HARPOON
Still...

BLUE GENERAL
You don't want me to order you to
do your duty.

HARPOON
No.

Harpoon picks up the satchel at his side, looks in the General's
eyes for the last time, and snaps a salute. The General salutes
back. Harpoon leaves.

AIDE
General, Alice is on the line.
CONTINUED: (3)
The General picks up the phone.

BLUE GENERAL
Alice, Harpoon's launched.

RKazaklis kicks the Space Invaders game in frustration.

Kazaklis kicks the machine again and turns to find Halupalai
grinning at him.

CONTINUED:

KAZAKLIS
You laughing at me, you over-the-hill
beach boy? I don't: know who's worse,
you or Moreau. You at least have
an IQ bigger than your shoe size.
It's very hard to pilot a plane with
the president of the Girls Athletic
League.

HALOPALAL
You're hopeless, Kazaklis. Why don't
you let up on her?

KAZAKLIS
Me? Don't lay that one on me, pal.
This joint's been like a sorority
house since Moreau showed up.

HALUPALAI
Uh uh. You'd like that.

KAZAKLIS
She still walks around here like
she's got cramps twenty-eight days
amonth. You think you can trust
somebody with nukes if they're on
the rag?

Halupalai goes quiet. He doesn't want to play anymore. de drifts
a far, far distance away. Kazaklis' smile fades. He looks at
Halupalai for a moment.

KAZAKLIS
Why don't you get cut of this,
Halupalai? How old are you,
forty-two? Forty-three? Been
through Nam. Why don't you retire
and coach feothall in those islands
of yours?

And then the SIREN WAILS.

Halupalai bolts out of his chair. He starts his seatback dash,
pivots sharply under the howling klaxon over the door and collides
with a terror stricken Vietnamese dishwasher with a plastic tub full
of plates. No word of social grace is uttered, the clock is on them
now. Kazaklis hits the hallway, trailing only slightly.

INT. MOREAU'S DORM ROOM -- ALERT FACILITY -- FAIRCHILD AFB

Moreau lands on her feet before her sleepy brain has completely
changed gears. Her roommate moves simultaneously and the two women
wedge in the door.

Halupalai shoots past in the hallway before Moreau elbows out firs:,
tipping the chastity belt photo in the scuffle. She slips in front
of Kazaklis taking off with long, long strides.

Kazaklis cuts off the roommate, causing her to stumble.
INT. LIBRARY -- ALERT FACILITY -- FAIRCHILD AFB

We SEE Tyler doing a little Indian dance as he hops on one foot,
Shen the other, tucking the laces into his boots without tying them.
He slams his economics text shut and runs.

INT. SHOWERS AND LOCKER ROOM -- ALERT FACILITY -- FAIRCHILD

O'Toole's heart leaps, as his stomach sinks, in a desperate attempt
to turn off the cold water. Radnor is already pulling on his flight
suit over his work-out shorts. He glances over at O'Toole with no
sign of sympathy.

RADNOR
You gonna have one very clean, very
cold fanny, pal.

O'Toole silently answers with an "Oh, shit" look in his eyes. He
grabs a towel, discards it immediately -- seconds ticking away -<-
and pulls his flight suit on over his dripping wet bedy. He forces
his wet feet into his boots, grabs his socks, underwear, and flighs
suit and starts running. He pauses in the doorway, lurches after
another towel, misses, drops his socks, pauses, leaves the socks
and starts running again like a scared kid on the way to the
dentist,

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM -- WASHINGTON, D.C.

The President is surrounded by oppressive grey file cabinets. He
is impatiently waiting for the telegraph operator, an Army SIGNAL
CORPSMAN to finish. As the Corpsman finishes, he forces a look of
Getachment as he hands the telegram to the President. As the
President begins to read we hear the Russian Premier's voice.

PREMIER (v.0.)
My dear Mr. President. By now you
ate aware that my government has
launched a limited number of nuclear
weapons at your country. The
missiles are selectively destined
for targets which will infliet
minimum damage on your great nation
and its civilian population and even
its military resources.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

PREMIER (Cont'd)
Your wisdom at this delicate time
can minimize the consequences of this
event which the mistakes of both
nations have made inevitable. The
parameters of our action must be
clear to you by now -- a strike at
all your bomber bases, a single ICBM
complex in Montana, and your primary
command facilities at Omaha and
Cheyenne Mountain. These show the
obvious == that all your targets,
like all curs, are vulnerable. There
is one final element. A single small
warhead has been directed at Andrews
Air Force Base. It has been set for
ground burst explosion which will
do little damage beyond the base.
The target is symbolic, Andrews being
the base from which you would
normally leave Washington. Some of
my colleagues demanded the inclusion
of an intimidation factor. It will
do you no personal harm.

EXT. ALERT FACILITY -- FAIRCHILD AF3

The hair in O'Tcole's nostrils is frozen.” Icy darts jab through
the soles of his boots. We HEAR the SOUND of WET FEET SLOSHING
inside. His mind is numb as he careens down the out-ramp of the
Alert Facility. Only his instincts and his training propel nim
after nis crewmates.

EXT. B-52 FLIGHT LINE -- FAIRCHILD AFB

Near the wing tip of their plane, Moreau, Halupalai, and Kazaklis
are neck and neck. Moreau scrambles up the belly hold first.
Kazaklis enters next, his groping hand landing on the inside of the
co-pilot's thigh.

MOREAU
You bastard!

KAZAKLIS
Move it, Moreau. I've felt better
thighs on a supermarket fryer.

At the top of the stairwell, Moreau hurries forward to the right
hand co-pilot's seat. She pulls the white, moon man helmet over
her head, adjusts the radio to all five channels. Kazaklis slips
into the left hand seat and does the same.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

KAZARLIS
Ignition.

MOREAO
Ignition.

Kazaklis' sinewy hands, covered in fire-proofed gloves, begin
manipulating eight white engine throttles. The engine roar begins

begins to chafe. He turns and Peers into the dark recesses of the

President's shoulder.

APPOINTMENTS SECRETARY
Mr. President, please, there is so
little time.

The President glances up briefly then resumes reading. The Russian
Premier's voice continues as before. : : : ~
PREMIER (v.0.)
It is of epochal importance that you
understand my rationale and recognize
that this is not an attempt at
territorial or political gain. It
is a moderate response to political
tealities inside my nation -- and
your nation as well. We have talked
to no avail and the insanity
continues, Quite simply, Mr.
President, my nation cannot afford
to match your arms buildups. Nor
can it allow them to go unmatched.
Two weeks ago, the Politburo voted
to mount a full scale pre-emptive
attack against your military and
strategic targets. A second assault
was poised against your cities if
you responded. I was able to delay
that action, But I have merely
Rpught us a brief moment for one
last, perhaps desperate effort to
halt the madness.

PREMIER (Cont'd)
I think we all, the leaders of both
our nations, knew it inevitably must
come to this -- or worse. Therefore,
to be blunt, Mr. President, you now
have three choices, only two of which
are acceptable to us. You can accept
the damage and we will stop, the
world divided as it is now between
us. Like you, I am a politician.
TI cannot imagine my political system
allowing me to accept that choice.
Your second choice is to respond with
a limited counter attack that
inflicts on my nation a similar
amount of damage. We will accept
that, provided the world's spheres
of influence remain the same and the
arms increases cease. Our

Galculations show that you will lose

between six and nine million people
in our attack. We will accept a
similar loss. It is a tremendous
price to pay but perhaps it can serve
as a symbol that shows all factions
in beth our nations the lunacy of

the game we have been Dlaying. You
will be under tremendous pressure,

as I was, to respond massively. This
is your third choice. If this is
your ultimate choice my government
already has decided to reply in kind,
even before your missiles land. 1
Pray now, Mr. President, that the
distrust is not total and that,
through the pain of the next few
minutes, you make the decision that
can bring this to a less than perfect
end, but an end.

We SEE the six year old Moreau seated at her desk, her hands folded.
We SEE the young woman SCHOOL TEACHER holding a stop watch and a
clipboard looking anxiously at her class and at the clock on the
wall. As the big hand and the second hand reach twelve she shouts.

TEACHER
Flash!

Simultaneously the fifth grade class drops to the floor, crouching
beneath their desks. Over this we hear:

RADIO VOICE
This is a test. This station is
‘conducting a test of the Emergency

We HEAR a high pitched WHINE. 2eN-n-Nen=nen=n-n=-n-n-nen. As the
WHINE CHANGES PITCH we begin to DISSOLVE rapidly and:

INT. B=52 COCKPIT -= INFLIGHT ~- DUSK

Moreau jerks slightly at the sound. She turns and sees Kazaklis
teaching for the lead-lined flash curtain. He tugs at the dirty
screen, pulling it across his side of the cockpit window. The whine
stops.

KAZAKLIS
I've got it now, co-pilot. pull your >

Moreau looks at him strangely, still believing this is a drill.

KAZARKLIS
Draw your curtain, co-pilot.

Moreau tightens.

Take the plane, co-pilot.

He then lunges out of his seat and reaches across the cockpit
towarés Moreau's curtain, In the Closeness, his gloved hand
accidentally catches Moreau in the LEFT EYE before he grasps the
curtain, The plane NOSES DOWNWARD as Moreau drops the controls,
pulling her hand up over her left eye. Kazaklis wrenches at the
curtain and succeeds in closing all but a narrow gap.

He sits back in his seat, takes the controls and steadies the plane.

Moreau sits mute for a moment, her left hand remaining over her eye.
Now with her right hand she stretches forward to close the gap in
the curtain. We SEE her one eye staring. Then we SEE her Pov of
the winter white moon she is trying to shut out.

Then the moon BURSTS. It bursts into a sun, then into ten thousand
suns. Moreau's eye remains transfixed on the curtain crack. Then
the screen goes white for a few seconds.

The shock wave hits. Kazaklis looks like he's been hit in the gut,
then slubbed. He is hurled forward into the pinched embrace of
his seat harness, then whipped back. He can hear the B-S2's wings
groaning under the immense stress, but he is groggy as if in a

Kazaklis ignores her. The air Speed indicator drops further.
Yellow alarm lights start flashing all over like a pinball machine.

A well placed judo chop finds the soft joint in Kazaklis' shoulder
where the nerves are exposed. His hands withdraw from the wheel

in a reflex motion. Moreau sits hunched over her wheel, nudging
the nose down. Kazaklis is tubbing the pain in his shoulder, Then
the AFTER SHOCKS hit, swiftly and in rapid succession. The shocks
pass more or less quietly and with decreasing vicor. A few beats

bills. When he finishes he has real Pain in his eyes. He looks
up at the Duty Officer.

Alice looks at his watch which reads 0630 ZULU. He swallows hard.

BLUE GENERAL (v.o0.)
Old buddy? Happy hunt...

Alice hears nothing. Just a SNAP, like a twig breaking. He
silently says good-bye. After a moment we can HEAR low POPPING
SOUNDS, ELECTRONIC CRACKLES. Then groaning and shouting from the
crew. Alice looks down the aisle of the Looking Glass Plane.
Computers flare and die. Men and women shout futilely at
machines that don't work.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROSE GARDEN -- NIGHT

The lighting is very sketchy. It's hard to see but the SOUNDS are
frightening. We HEAR THOUSANDS OF VOICES, gutteral, primal, ugly.
We HEAR THE ANGRY SCOURGE OF METAL ON METAL, CARS SCRAPING,
COLLIDING, RAMMING on Pennsylvania Avenue. HORNS BLARE everywhere,
GUNFIRE POPS far off and then in bursts Nearby. Through it all we
HEAR the WHUMP-WHUMP-WHUMB of the President's HELICOPTER.

A flare goes off briefly freeze-framing figures of men clambering
over the East fence. The flare goes out but now the red tracers
from their guns sweep toward us.

Sedgewick knocks the President to the ground. One, two, many Secret
Servicemen fling themselves on top. PING, PING, the bullets hit
the side of the chopper.

SEDGEWICK
Take it easy, sir. Just Stay down.

PRESIDENT
Who are those people?

SEDGEWICK
People, people, sir. Scared, angry,
spooked people.

You've got the last train out of

The other Secret Service agents crouch low in a circle around them.
One of them speaks urgently into his radio,

AGENT #1
I know that, goddammit. Do you want
him dead or alive? No, he does not
have his vest on. He's got his
bathrobe on! Yes, I understand.

Yes.

The Marines are gonna open up ina

down. No stepping. Full speed.
Run. Understand?

PRESIDENT
Yes.

AGENT 41
Can you-do it?

PRESIDENT
Yes.

In that moment the world explodes again in GUNFIRE. He runs to the
bottom of the helicopter stairs and stumbles. One agent and the
Duty Officer catch him and shove him roughly up the stairs.

The helicopter lifts off at a Strange angle, banks sharply over the
trees, and flashes by the Washington Monument on its way toward
Andrews Air Force Sase.

The President tries to hide his emotion. ‘The whole thing seems to
be slipping beyond his control. He looks out the window, his eyes

Moreau unsnaps her helmet and tries to relax. She sets her helmet
aside and catches her reflection in the Picture tube of her radar
screen. She smiles silently to herself, then puts on her radio
headset. .

MOREAQ
Hey, how's the crazy Irishman doing

We should now cut to whoever is talking at their various stations

INT. B-52 -- NAVIGATOR'S STATION -= INFLIGHT

Tyler ignores the whole proceeding his crewmates struggle to get the
body down the ladder. He never looks once as the body is laid out
behind him.

Radnor returns to his position next to Tyler while Halupalai returns
to his, upstairs.

Q'Toole's body has a profound effect on Radnor. He stares at the
two V-angled boots, the two legs and the beginning of O'Toole's
torso, all bathed in a malevolent red hue.

Now he catches Tyler touching the glossy image of his son -- a Kodak
icon that Tyler has pasted above his radar screen. Tyler talks
softly to it while his finger caresses the little cherub cheek in
the photograph.

Radnor wants to scream, but he doesn't. This whole thing is giving
him the jitters. He remembers his own wife and then begins to sob.

after a few moments Radnor calls on his training and with great
effort shakes his head, wipes his tears, and begins to work again
with his instruments.

INT. E-4 -= BRIEFING ROOM -- INFLIGHT

On one wall there are three computerized maps. One of the U.S.
One of the Soviet Onion. One Mercator map of world. The
compartment is like a spotless oval boardroom. Around a table sit
six Air Force Generals and a single prim Colonel. Condor sits at
the head of the table. Harpoon is lecturing in front of the maps.

HARPOON
Our ICBMs were launched in two waves.
Most of our bombers were caught on
the ground. Those bombers that .
survived should be at their positive
control points. If ordered to go in
they will reach their targets in four
to six hours. The bulk of our
submarine forces, in which we carry
most of our destructive power, was
placed on hold for exactly eleven
hours. Seven hours from now their
instructions are to hit their targets
unless they receive contrary orders.
The assumption is: If they can't
hear us, then we're still at war.
The subs would constitute our third
strike and complete the destruction
of the Soviet Union.

CONDOR |
You find fault in that, Harpoon?

HARPOON
They have a system of their own, sir.
They put most of their warheads in
land based ICBMS and most of those
are still unused. [In a few hours
their bombers are going to be roaming
at will throughout this country
taking out our cities. A few hours
later our subs will take out theirs.

pick off their targets one by
Goddamned one. New York,
Philadelphia, Denver...

thing.

HARPOON

No. The bombers that did get off
will be under attack by Soviet
fighter interceptors.

CONDOR
The Soviets can attack our bombers
and we can't attack theirs?

HARPOON
Sir, they had the element of surprise
and they spent a lot of money on
bomber defenses, as we wanted them
to. Wasting money on defenses for
a war with no defense.

CONDOR
This is the mest cockamamie,
defeatest thing I've ever heard.
What about the subs? How many
warheads we got in there?

HARPOON
About 7,000, sir.

planes hit our cities.

HARPOON
I can't order the submarines to do
anything. Nor can you. They
received orders hours ago to run
silent and deep, away from detection
or communications for eleven hours.
Then the main part of the fleet will
come back near the surface to listen.
If they hear nothing they will fire.
That's the system. The Soviets know
the system as well as we do. They
know if their bombers strike, if they
send off more ICBMs, they're dead.
Because there'll be no one left and
no reason to call off the submarines.

CONDOR
You're telling me the fate of our
nation rests with a dead computer?

HARPOON
Well not quite, siz. The war plans
were devised with a purpose. Both
sides knew if this thing ever got
started, we'd have tremendous
problems with ego, national pride,
communications. So we built in
pauses, Bombers are very slow. They
are a builtein natural pause to the
war. We are in that pause, but
coming to the end of it.

CONDOR
And the pause was designed to do
precisely what?

HARPOON
To give us time to patch our
communications, siz. And to give
you and your Soviet counterpart time
to think things over and maybe find
a way to turn the war off. You have
a copy of the Premier 's message in
the folder in front of you. 1 don't
know what to make of it but he
offered to accept an equal amount
of damage in the Soviet Union.

eption is to turn some of our bombers

We'll still have the subs in reserve.
Really, sir, I think it's our only
option right now.

Bullshit! There is another option.
God damn it. We can cut the head

Victory is possible, sir, and it's

Soviets. They would see it as a sign
of weakness. We have an opportunity
to allow the Soviet people to throw
off the yoke of totalitarian
dictatorship which has oppressed them

as they overthrew the Czars during
the First World War.

HARPOON
For Christ's sake, Colonel, they

No, Admiral, they do not. But we

majestic stem of the cloud the other. Lightning strikes purple and
violet, dart throughout the pillar. The pillar is twelve miles

bag, takes off his right glove and with the bag on his lap rummages
around inside. He pulls out a small canister and snaps it open.

It is a cyanide capsule. She takes it in her hand, starts to shift
out of her seat to go downstairs. Kazaklis grabs her wrist, hard.
The capsule pops loose and rolls across the floor.

headset with him. Kazaklis edges down the short walkway toward
Halupalai, then plops down in O'Tocle's old seat. Even before
Kazaklis plugs in, Halupalai's eyes tell him the man knows. The
eyes have a bleak look of failure.

KAZAKLIS

Razaklis squeezes the gunner's arm, smiles, gropes for words.

lower compartment just behind Halupalai.

Kazaklis backs down the rungs of the hatch ladder. Radnor doesn't
even notice. Tyler watches suspiciously. When Kazaklis reaches
bottom and turns around he sees a kind of nightmare. O'Toole's body

KAZAKLIS

He places a hand on each man's knee. Radnor is lifeless. Tyler
flexes.

TYLER (menacing)

He pushes Kazaklis' hand off his knee.

KAZAKLIS
I know you are. We all were. We've
been EWO ready a long time.

Kazaklis looks compassionately at Tyler, then mistakenly at the
photo of Tyler's child.

An elbow rips into Kazaklis' rib cage sending him backwards on his
rump. His radio wire is still attached.

Tyler shields the photograph with one hand. With the ether he pulls
the radio wire out of its socket and wraps it once around Kazaklis' ~

neck. He jerks and relaxes the radio wire on each tortured
syllable.

TYLER
EEE...WOE...RED....DEE. Ready!
Ready! Now!

Razaklis’ head continues to bang on the floor as Tyler
disintegrates,

TYLER

For the first time now Radnor turns expressionlessly to the scene,
He makes no move.

TYLER

Kazaklis jams a steel plated book into Tyler's shoulder. He jumps
up and tries to grab Tyler. Kazaklis gets another elbow in the

ribs, Kazaklis strikes quickly with a judo chop to the neck and
Tyler slumps to the side.

RADNOR

Radnor is too fast for him. He removes the white capsule and bites
down on it before he swallows. Radnor's face is rapturous. Slowly
his head slumps forward onto his desk top.

Tyler watches in stuporous wonder for a moment. Then he leans back
for his own alert bag. He rummages inside, withdraws a .45
automatic, and makes sure the clip is full. He unhooks his radio
set and moves toward the Ladder.

On his radar sereen, now unseen by Tyler, a squadron of incognites

that he's capable of pulling the trigger.

PRESIDENT
I couldn't order you to do that.

ALICE
Order me, sir? It was my idea.

PRESIDENT
There must be some other way.

ALICE
Mr. President, we have less than one
hour before the subs will fire. I
have serious doubts there is any way
to stop it. But if we are able to
reach the TACAMO planes, you can bet
the Ee4 will be able to reach them.
If those planes get conflicting
orders, the subs will stick with
their original battleplan. It's that
simple.

PRESIDENT
What do you think, Sedgewick?

SEDGEWICK
I’m afraid the General's right, Mr.
President. However, to make anything
work the General will have to read
me the authenticator codes. Digit
by digit. Letter by letter. That is
extremely dangerous. We know the
Soviets can probably hear the Looking
Glass since they've got a couple of
Satellites functioning. [If they pick
up the codes, they'll have almost
as much control over our weapons as
you de, sir.
