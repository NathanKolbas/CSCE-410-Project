EXT. DARKEST PERU - A FEW BEARS YEARS AGO

Somewhere in the depths of the Amazon Rainforest, a home-made
ROPE BRIDGE stretches across a vast jungle valley.

Rainwater cascades down the hillsides in waterfalls and a
huge river flows far beneath, but sitting on the bridge,
perfectly serene, are two elderly bears, LUCY and PASTUZO.

Lucy is pouring herself a CUP OF TEA while Pastuzo makes
himself a MARMALADE SANDWICH.

He puts it under his battered red bush hat for safekeeping,
and sets about making a quadruple decker sandwich to eat now.

PASTUZO
Our last rainy season.

LUCY
Just think Pastuzo, this time next
month we’ll be in London...

PASTUZO
..-where the rivers run with
marmalade and the streets are paved
with bread.

Lucy gives him a quizzical look.

LUCY

Did you read the book about London?
PASTUZO

I skimmed it.
LUCY

(gently scolding)

Pastuzo!

PASTUZO

Well, reading makes me sleepy. But
any city that can come up with this
is alright by me.

Pastuzo slaps the last slice of bread onto his sandwich and
squishes it down, SQUIRTING MARMALADE over Lucy’s glasses.

She takes them off to wipe them - but as she does so, she
spots something moving in the river beneath them.

LUCY
Oh Pastuzo, look!

Pastuzo picks up a pair of binoculars and peers through them
to see a TINY BEAR CUB clinging desperately to a BRANCH,
floating inexorably downstream towards a WATERFALL.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 2.

PASTUZO
It’s... it’s a cub!

Pastuzo lowers his binoculars to see Lucy climbing down one
of the TRAILING VINES that hang from the rope bridge.

PASTUZO (CONT’D)
Lucy!

LUCY
Lower me down.

Pastuzo unties the vine and starts lowering Lucy towards the
torrent that rages beneath them.

Meanwhile, the cub is struggling to stay on his branch. He
loses his footing and slips into the water, but just manages
to retain his grip.

Lucy is still a few metres above the water.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Lower, Pastuzo! Lower!

The cub looks up to see Lucy on the rope, stretching out a
paw towards him. It’s his last chance of salvation.

He reaches up to grab hold but SLIPS FROM THE BRANCH.

Without pausing to think, Lucy DIVES FROM THE VINE and into
the swirling WATERS.

Pastuzo is YANKED FROM HIS POSITION ON THE BRIDGE, his HAT
falling from his head.

The branch, without its passenger, plunges over the waterfall
and disappears into the swirling mists below.

Back on the rope bridge, there is no sign of life.

But then the camera moves and we discover PASTUZO has managed
to cling to the underside of the bridge with one paw.

He cautiously opens an eye and, to his great relief, sees
Lucy swinging from the vine beneath him.

PASTUZO
Lucy? Lucy!

LUCY
I'm afraid we're not going to
London after all, Pastuzo.

PASTUZO
Why not?

Lucy is staring with love in her eyes at the drenched little
bear cub she has managed to save from the waters.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 3.

PASTUZO’S HAT has fallen onto his head.

LUCY
We've got a cub to raise.

PASTUZO
What’s he like?

LUCY
Rather small...

The CUB SNEEZES, sending PASTUZO’S HAT over his face.

LUCY (CONT'D)
And rather sneezy!

Lucy tenderly lifts the hat to discover the cub is now eating
PASTUZO’S SANDWICH. He burps, surprising himself.

LUCY (CONT'D)
But he likes his marmalade.

PASTUZO
Well that’s a good sign.

LUCY
Oh yes, Pastuzo. If we look after
this bear, I have a feeling he’ll
go far.

As Pastuzo hauls them to safety, the camera cranes up to the
vast Amazon sky.

We mix through to a different sky and the TITLES START as we
crane down to find the towers, spires and rooftops of the
LONDON SKYLINE, a few bear years later...
EXT. WINDSOR GARDENS - DAY
In a beautiful street of pastel coloured homes, the SAME BEAR
CUB, a little older and scruffier, but still wearing the same
battered red hat, sits in a round attic window.
This is PADDINGTON, gazing out at the city he loves.
PADDINGTON (V.O.)
Dear Aunt Lucy...
INT. PADDINGTON'S ATTIC ROOM - MORNING
Paddington sets about his day.
PADDINGTON (V.O.)
I hope all is well in the Home for

Retired Bears. Life in London has
been better than ever this summer.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 4.

INT. THE BROWNS’ BATHROOM - MORNING
Paddington fires up two ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
I'm really getting to grips with
how things work.

He puts the two toothbrushes in his EARS.
Next he sticks them up his NOSE.
And only then does he use them on his TEETH.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
And it seems there’s something new
to do every day.

INT. THE BROWNS’ KITCHEN - MORNING

Paddington sits at the table, surrounded by the happy chaos
of a family breakfast.

JUDY, a defiantly intellectual fourteen year old, shows
Paddington a leaflet for “KOSLOVA’S STEAM FAIR” while he
devours a pile of sandwiches.

JUDY
Guess what, Paddington? The Steam
Fair's coming to town! I’m going
along tonight to write about it for
my newspaper.

JONATHAN, her twelve year old brother, is immediately
concerned at the impact this might have on his reputation.

JONATHAN
Who’s going to want to read about
that?

JUDY

Everyone! They travel the world in
an old steam train. I thought you’d

love it.

JONATHAN
I do, but don’t tell anyone ok? Not
cool.

Judy rolls her eyes at her conformist brother. Their
adventurous mother, MARY, is full of the fun of the fair.

MARY
Why don’t we all go? Your father’s
a dab hand at the coconut shy.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 5.

Her husband, HENRY, mimes throwing a ball and feels a twinge
in his shoulder.

HENRY
Ooh, not anymore. Coconuts are a
young man’s game.

PADDINGTON
Well I think you’re in great shape
for a man of your age, Mr Brown.

HENRY
Thank you, Paddington. Hang on, how
old do you think I am?

PADDINGTON
Oh... about eighty?

HENRY
Eighty?!

PADDINGTON
At least!

Paddington puts the last sandwich in his hat and gets up to
leave - but MRS BIRD, the Browns’ aged Scottish relative and
redoubtable housekeeper, stops him in his tracks.

MRS BIRD
Just a minute, wee bear. I thought
I told you to clean your ears.

PADDINGTON
But I did, Mrs Bird...

Mrs Bird MAGICS A COIN from BEHIND HIS EAR.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
I wonder how that got in there!

EXT. WINDSOR GARDENS - MORNING

Paddington runs out of the house as a BICYCLE comes round the
corner towards him.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
I really feel at home in Windsor
gardens.

The FRENCH CYCLIST rings her bell.

PADDINGTON
Bonjour, Mademoiselle!

CYCLIST
Good morning, Paddington!
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 6.

Paddington leaps on the back of the bike and hands the
cyclist a sandwich as they free-wheel down the street.

PADDINGTON
I brought you breakfast.

CYCLIST
Thank you. Your sandwiches always
put me in a good mood.

They pass an ABSENT-MINDED DOCTOR emerging from his house.

PADDINGTON
Morning, Dr Jafri. You haven’t
forgotten your keys, have you?

Dr Jafri stops, pats his pockets and panics.

DR JAFRI
Keys? Keys!

Dr Jafri rushes back to his closing front door, catching it
just before he is locked out.

DR JAFRI (CONT'D)
Thank you, Paddington!

PADDINGTON
You’re welcome!

Paddington and the Cyclist ride on past the COLONEL, a
gloomy, dishevelled man with a military moustache and a
week’s stubble wearing a dressing gown.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Glorious day, Colonel!

COLONEL
Is it? How absolutely thrilling.

They pass a NEWSPAPER KIOSK. The owner is a cheery eccentric
with a twinkle in her eye and a parrot on her shoulder.

PADDINGTON
How was your date, Miss Kitts?

MISS KITTS
Well he wasn’t the one, but you
know what they say?

PARROT
Plenty more fish in the sea.

MISS KITTS
Exactly!

Mrs Kitts THROWS A PAPER towards the bike. Paddington catches
it and puts it in the CYCLIST’S BASKET.
8A

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 7.

They sail round a corner and pull alongside a DUSTBIN LORRY.
Paddington hops onto the back of the lorry as the cyclist
heads off in another direction.

PADDINGTON
(to the Bin Man)
Morning, Mr Barnes!

BIN MAN
Morning.

PADDINGTON
Au revoir, Mademoiselle.

CYCLIST
Bye, Paddington.

The Bin Man hands him a much-thumbed A-Z MAP OF LONDON.

BIN MAN
Come on then, test me.

PADDINGTON
What’s the quickest way from
Buckingham Palace to Big Ben?

BIN MAN
Ooh, an easy one! Straight down the
Mall, turn right...

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
Everyone’s so kind and welcoming,
even though they’re very busy.

The dustbin lorry passes under a railway bridge as a
COLOURFUL TRAIN crosses carrying KOZLOVA’S STEAM FAIR.

EXT. SERPENTINE SWIMMING CLUB - MORNING
Mary DIVES into the LAKE.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)

Mrs Brown has decided to swim to
France. It seems an awful lot of
hard work given you can go by boat
or plane or even train.

CUTAWAY: VARIOUS MODES OF TRAVEL.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)

But she’s spent the summer cooped
up illustrating a series of
adventure stories and has decided
she wants one of her own.

INT. HENRY AND MARY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mary, sitting at her desk, doodles a picture of herself
sitting at the same desk.

The drawing COMES TO LIFE and ILLUSTRATED MARY climbs out of
the window. We discover the window is actually in an airship
floating over an ocean.

ILLUSTRATED MARY dives out of the window and into the waters
below, where she discovers a sunken city.
INT. JUDY’S BEDROOM - DAY
Judy is on the telephone.
PADDINGTON (V.O.)
Judy is suffering from a broken
heart.
JUDY
I’m dumped? I think you’1l find
you're dumped Tony.

She slams down the phone.

CUTAWAY: BLACK AND WHITE STOCK FOOTAGE OF NUNS

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
Her first reaction was to become a
nun - but she soon got over that
and has thrown herself into a new
hobby.

INT. SCHOOL PRINTING ROOM - VARIOUS DAYS
Judy comes into the room and discovers a PRINTING PRESS.
PADDINGTON (V.O.)
She found an old printing press at
school and is starting a newspaper.

With no boys.

Paddington watches Judy proudly printing the first issue of
“The Portobello Express”.

JUDY
Now all we need is some news!
INT. JONATHAN'S ROOM - DAY

Paddington helps Jonathan put the finishing touches to a
scale model of a steam engine.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 9.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
Jonathan is joining her at big
school this year. He spent the
summer building a steam engine but
I’m not supposed to talk about it
as it is ‘not cool’.

13 CUTAWAY: CHANGING LOOK BOOK.

A flip-flap book shows Jonathan going from his true self to
new persona wearing ridiculous cyber-shades.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)

He’s got a whole new look and if
anyone asks, he’s called J-Dog -
and is definitely not into steam
trains.

14 INT. JONATHAN'S ROOM - DAY
Jonathan sadly shuts the steam engine away in his cupboard.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
But Mr Brown has been busiest of
all.

15 INT. LLOYDS OF LONDON - DAY

Mr Brown stands among a crowd of his colleagues, nervously
anticipating the announcement of his promotion.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
He recently had a surprise at work.

C.E.O.
I’m delighted to announce our new
Head of Risk Analysis will be...
Steve Visby.

A MUCH YOUNGER MAN steps forward. Henry’s face drops.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
This has triggered what Mrs Bird
calls a Full Blown Midlife Crisis.

16 CUTAWAY: FOOD BLENDER, HAIR DYE.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)

It involves blending his food,
painting his hair and engaging in a
process called “Chakrabatics.”

INT. FITNESS STUDIO - DAY

The camera tracks across a group of lycra-clad young people
doing the splits.

CHAKRABATICS INSTRUCTOR
Open your mind and your legs will
follow.

Henry, similarly dressed, tries to do the splits and falls.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD MARKET - DAY
Paddington jumps off the dustbin lorry, returning the A-Z.

PADDINGTON
That’s ten out of ten, Mr Barnes!

MR BARNES
Thank you, Paddington.

PADDINGTON
Keep up the good work!

The Bin Lorry drives on as Paddington walks down the market,
greeting the market traders.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
Oh Aunt Lucy, you sent me to London
to find a home and it’s worked out
better than I ever imagined. I have
a wonderful family and have made
friends in all sorts of places.

Paddington stops to give some breakfast to WOLFIE, a stray
dog who lives in an alley off the Portobello Road.

PADDINGTON
Here you go, Wolfie. See you
tomorrow!

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
I do hope if you could see me,
you'd be pleased. Lots of love from
Paddington.

Paddington walks up the street into GRUBER’S ANTIQUES.

PADDINGTON
Mr Gruber?
INT. GRUBER'S ANTIQUES - DAY

Paddington walks through to the back of the shop where there
are boxes and crates full of FAIRGROUND MEMORABILIA.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 11.

Mr Gruber is coming downstairs from the upper workshop.

MR GRUBER
Ah Mr Brown, come in! I just hada
visit from Madame Kozlova who runs
the fair.

PADDINGTON
Oh yes?

MR GRUBER
They were having a clear out and
found all these old crates stuffed
with memory-bilia they thought had
been lost forever.

Paddington growls, interested.

MR GRUBER (CONT'D)
She's asked me to sell it for them
while they’re in town and I thought
there must be something in here for
your Aunt Lucy’s birthday.

PADDINGTON
Good idea.

Paddington starts looking through the memorabilia, touching a
VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR which makes his FUR STAND ON END.

MR GRUBER
Ooh! Look at this!

He pulls out a MECHANICAL MONKEY ON A TRAPEZE.

PADDINGTON
It’s very nice, Mr Gruber, but...
MR GRUBER
I know, I know, it’s got to be
perfect.
PADDINGTON

Since Uncle Pastuzo died, I’m the
only relative she’s got left - and
it isn’t every day a bear turns a
hundred.

Paddington rummages in a trunk, finding a WIG AND GLASSES.
MR GRUBER
Quite so. Ah, how about these
rolling shoes?

He holds up some ROLLER SKATES. Paddington - now wearing the
wig and glasses - is unconvinced.
20

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 12.

PADDINGTON
Please Mr Gruber, be serious.

MR GRUBER
Perhaps your Aunty’s rolling days
are behind her.

Paddington digs into one of the trunks.

PADDINGTON
I think you might be right. Ooh.
What’s this?

He pulls out an OLD BOOK and Mr Gruber consults a list.

MR GRUBER
Ah, now this must be the popping
book! Very interesting.

PADDINGTON
Really?

MR GRUBER
You see, Madame Kozlova’s great-
grandmother, who started the fair,
was a brilliant artist. Every time
they visited a new city, she made a
popping book to remember it by, and
this is London.

Paddington opens the book to reveal a POP-UP TOWER BRIDGE.

PADDINGTON
Oh Mr Gruber it’s wonderful! Aunt
Lucy’s always dreamed of coming to
London and never had the chance -
but if she saw this, it would be
like she were finally here...

As Paddington gazes into the book, the camera pushes in,
and we find ourselves in an INCREDIBLE POP-UP WORLD...

INT. POP-UP LONDON - DAY (FANTASY)

The PAPER LANDSCAPE COMES TO LIFE. A PAPER SHIP passes
through the bridge and, as the camera swoops in towards it,
we discover a THREE-DIMENSIONAL AUNT LUCY on board.

She waves down to the riverbank where a THREE-DIMENSIONAL
PADDINGTON is making his way through a crowd of two-
dimensional pop-up people towards the gangplank.

PADDINGTON
Aunt Lucy! Aunt Lucy!

AUNT LUCY
Paddington!
21

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 13.

The two bears fly into each other’s arms. She holds him tight
and then looks around in wonder.

PADDINGTON
Come with me, Aunt Lucy.

Paddington takes her paw and leads her on a magical journey
through the book. They head into a pop-up underground station
and emerge - via a page turn - in a pop-up Piccadilly Circus.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Well? What do you think

AUNT LUCY
It’s wonderful!

They cross the road towards a pop-up bus and get on board.

PADDINGTON
One and a half bears, please.

CONDUCTOR
Mind your step, Madam.

AUNT LUCY
What a polite young man.

Another page turn takes them to St. Paul's Cathedral where
they feed the birds. A pigeon coos pleasantly.

AUNT LUCY (CONT’D)
What a polite young pigeon!

And then, finally, across the river looking at Big Ben.
AUNT LUCY (CONT’D)
Oh Paddington! You’ve made an old
bear so very happy.

The BOOK CLOSES and we find ourselves back in the real world.

INT. GRUBER’S ANTIQUES - DAY
Paddington’s eyes glisten with joy.

PADDINGTON
This is perfect.

Mr Gruber consults the list in more detail.

MR GRUBER
Ah. We have a snag.

PADDINGTON
Do we?
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 14.

MR GRUBER
You see, this popping book is the
only one of its kind - and they
want rather a lot of money for it.

Paddington reaches into his ear and pulls out a coin.

PADDINGTON
Mrs Bird found this coin in my ear
at breakfast. Perhaps there’s more.

He starts banging the side of his head, hoping to dislodge
more money from his ear.

MR GRUBER
It’ll take more than an earful, Mr
Brown! I’m afraid you'd need a
thousand of those coins.

PADDINGTON
Oh.

Paddington puts the coin back in his ear.

MR GRUBER
Take another look at the monkey. I
think he’s super-duper.

He offers up the mechanical monkey which flies off its stand.

MR GRUBER (CONT'D)
I can fix that.

PADDINGTON
That's very kind, Mr Gruber, but
Aunt Lucy did so much for me when I
was a cub, and this could be my way
of saying thank you. I’m going to
get a job and buy that book.

MR GRUBER
Well the barber mentioned he was
looking for someone to mind his
shop this afternoon. Why don’t you
try there?

22 EXT. BARBER’S SHOP - DAY

PADDINGTON, wearing a barber’s jacket, is sweeping up in a
smart shop. The owner, MR GIUSEPPE, is leaving.

GIUSEPPE
Back in a few minutes. Ciao ciao
Paddington!

PADDINGTON
Ciao ciao Mr Giuseppe!
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 15.

23 INT. BARBER’S SHOP - DAY

Alone in the shop, Paddington turns to the broom and
addresses it as though it were a customer.

PADDINGTON
Good afternoon. Welcome to
Giuseppe’s Grooming Salon. What can
I do for you today, sir? A shave? A
light pomade? Or is it just a
brush?

CUSTOMER (0.S.)
Quick trim please, barber!

Paddington looks round to find a CURT CUSTOMER with a
MAGNIFICENT MANE OF GREY HAIR has come in to the shop.

The Customer has mistaken Paddington for the barber.

 

PADDINGTON
I’m not the Barber. I just tidy up.

CUSTOMER
That’s all I want. Tidy up the back
and sides, and nothing off the top.

PADDINGTON
Yes, but...

CUSTOMER
No buts! Come on man, chop chop!

The Customer settles down in the chair and closes his eyes.

PADDINGTON
If you say so, sir.

He takes the scissors from his pocket - but he’s not used to
them and they fly straight out of his paw into the ceiling.

He looks around for something to use instead of the scissors
and spots some ELECTRIC CLIPPERS.

He switches them on - but the MOTOR is so strong it makes his
ARM VIBRATE WILDLY.

He manages to grab hold of the clippers with both paws and
clasp them to his chest - but they simply make his WHOLE BODY
VIBRATE, like a road worker with a JACKHAMMER.

He starts to bounce around the room, the LONG FLEX wrapping
around his hands and feet, ensnaring him completely.

The clippers tear through a display of brushes as the
trailing flex starts snagging on various bits of furniture.

Luckily, the customer has dropped off to sleep.
24

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 16.

Just then a PHONE RINGS. Paddington happens to bounce pass
and answers it, flipping it up behind his ear with his mouth.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Hello, Giuseppe’s? Oh hello Mr
Jameson. Would you mind if I called
you back? I think I may be about to
shave a customer.

Now Paddington finds the clippers heading TOWARDS THE
CUSTOMER. He tries to change course but is so bound up in
flex that he’s powerless to do anything about it.

Millimetres from the customer's head, Paddington’s progress
is miraculously arrested. The cord of the clippers has pulled
taut, saving the Customer in the nick of time. Phew!

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Thank goodness.

But then, the tension in the cable pulls the lever on the
chair, and the customer’s hair is lowered onto the clippers.

Paddington yelps as HAIR FLIES EVERYWHERE.

And to make things worse, the plug flies out the socket,
shoots up to the ceiling fan, and the flex starts being wound
up around it. Paddington is yanked off his feet.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
I’m just putting you on hold...

The fan whips him up and SPINS HIM AROUND at high speed.

EXT. BARBER’S SHOP - DAY

A MOTHER is giving her son a stern talking-to outside the
barber's shop window.

MUM
It’s only a hair cut, Nelson,
there’s nothing to be afraid of.
Paddington is HURLED from the fan and SPLATS onto the window.

PADDINGTON
Come in, take a seat.

MUM
Let’s go somewhere else.

He SQUEAKS OFF THE GLASS and lands on the floor with a thump.
25

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 17.

INT. BARBER’S SHOP - DAY

Paddington picks himself up off the floor and stares at the
damage. The customer has a TEN INCH STRIP shaved into the
back of his head like a REVERSE MOHICAN.

PADDINGTON
Ooh, that’s not good.

Paddington tries to put the SHAVED HAIR back on to the
customer’s head but, of course, it won’t stick.

Then he has an idea. He gets a jar of marmalade from his
pocket, opens it, scoops out a pawful and SMEARS MARMALADE
all over the Customer’s now-bald patch.

CUSTOMER
(half asleep)
What is it?

PADDINGTON
Just putting in some product, sir.

CUSTOMER
(half asleep)
Jolly good. Carry on.
A few moments later:

Paddington has finished his repair job. Above him, the fan is
still bound up with flex and SMOKING GENTLY.

He raises the customer’s chair and shows him his handiwork.
PADDINGTON
All done, sir! I must say it’s come
out a lot better than I expected.

The Customer wakes, looks in the mirror. The front is fine.

But when he touches the back of his head, he feels something
weird and then SCRAPES the marmalade off his head.

CUSTOMER
What the devil’s this?

PADDINGTON
Erm. ..Marmalade.

CUSTOMER
Marmalade?

PADDINGTON

Hairy marmalade.

CUSTOMER
Well get it off!
26

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 18.

PADDINGTON
Yes sir! Right away sir.

Paddington LICKS the back of the customer’s head. Just then
the Barber comes back to see what he’s doing.

CUSTOMER
What is the matter with you?

BARBER
Paddington!

PADDINGTON
Mr Giuseppe! I can explain. It’s
not as bad as it looks.

But just then the fan sparks, the smoke alarm sounds, and the
sprinklers go off, drenching everyone in the shop.

CUT TO:

EXT. KOSLOVA’S STEAM FAIR - DUSK

Paddington WRINGS OUT HIS HAT as the Browns and Mrs Bird walk
through the entrance to KOSLOVA’S STEAM FAIR.

PADDINGTON
Have you ever been fired, Mr Brown?

HENRY
Well, no, but are you sure you’re
ready for the workplace Paddington?
It’s a tough, competitive world out
there and I worry a kind, good-
natured little bear might get
trampled underfoot.

Paddington takes a bite of a TOFFEE APPLE but it’s so sticky
he struggles to free his tongue from the sticky apple.

JUDY
He’s right, you know. You can’t
trust anyone. That’s why I’m doing
my newspaper alone.

MARY

Darling, is this about Tony?
JUDY

No!
MARY

Ok.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 19.

JONATHAN
Everything’s about Tony. And the
only reason nobody’s helping with
your paper is because it’s so lame.

JUDY
Well at least I’m not pretending to
be someone I’m not.

JONATHAN
Nor am I! G-Man!

Jonathan has spotted a similarly dressed group of other kids,
slips on his cyber-shades and fires up an electronic t-shirt.

CYBER-KID
J-dog. Spud bounce.

They bump fists. Paddington finally manages to pull his
tongue from the toffee apple.

PADDINGTON
But Aunt Lucy said if you’re kind
and polite, the world will be
right.

MRS BIRD
At least someone’s making sense!

PADDINGTON
And you're kind, Mr Brown, and
you've made it to the top.

HENRY
I’m nowhere near the top. I peaked
in the middle. Now the hair’s gone
grey, the belly’s popped out and
I’ve started to creak.

They approach a large crowd who burst into applause as a
charming, handsome, charismatic actor with dazzling blue eyes
hops up onto a small stage. This is PHOENIX BUCHANAN.

Behind him stands an old fairground organ emblazoned with the
legend, “KOZLOVA’S! Where All Your Dreams Come True!”

PADDINGTON
Ooh! Doesn't that man live in the
big house on the corner?

JONATHAN
It’s Phoenix Buchanan.

Judy starts taking photographs with her camera.

JUDY
Dad's ‘celebrity’ client.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 20.

HENRY
He’s one of our Platinum Club
members. And a very famous actor.

MRS BIRD
Hmph. Or used to be. Now he does
dog food commercials.

Paddington is surprised by her response. Mary explains.

MARY
Mrs Bird doesn't like him because
he can never remember her name.

Phoenix finally quietens the crowd.

PHOENIX
Thank you! Thank you! Come on now,
that’s enough. Alright, little bit
more! Honestly, what am I like? I’m
at my absolute naughtiest tonight.

The audience laugh.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
I am tickled the deepest shade of
shrimp to have been asked here
tonight to open this wonderful old
steam fair. But you know, when
Madame Kozlova created this place
all those years ago, she didn’t do
it for the likes of me, whatever I
am, “Celebrity,” “Star,” hate all
that stuff - “West End Legend,”
that’s another one. No, she made it
for you guys: the ordinary people.
So I'd like to ask one of you to
come up here and help start things
off. Volunteers?

Paddington’s arm shoots up.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
Eeny, meeny, miney... bear! How
about the young bear? Yes, why not?
Come on up, young ursine!

The audience clap as Paddington climbs up on stage. Judy
takes more photographs.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
Very good. And you are...

Paddington Brown.

PHOENIX
Of course! You’re my new neighbour!
You live with Henry and Mary and
Mrs er... fuh nuh nuh.

Mrs Bird rolls her eyes.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
Now I suppose you know who I am?

PADDINGTON
Oh yes, you’re a very famous actor.

Phoenix smiles with false humility.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Or used to be.

The smile vanishes.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Now you do dog food commercials.

The crowd chuckle. Phoenix smiles through gritted teeth.

PHOENIX
Well, a man has to eat!

PADDINGTON
What? Dog food?

The crowd laugh again. Phoenix forces himself to laugh along.

PHOENIX
Very, very funny. Anyway they do
say at Kozlova’s, all your dreams
come true. If you could have one
wish tonight, what would it be?

PADDINGTON
Oh that’s easy. I'd like to get my
Aunt Lucy a birthday present.

PHOENIX
Aw!

PADDINGTON
I’ve got my eye on old pop-up book
of London. Made by Madame Kozlova,
as it happens.

Phoenix’s eyes light up. He’s intrigued but tries to hide it.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
But it’s rather expensive so I need
to get my paws on an awful lot of
money.

PHOENIX
Well I’m not sure if we can promise
you that, but we can promise you
oodles of fun! So if you’1l lend me
a paw, I'd like to declare
Kozlova’s Steam Fair OPEN!

 

Phoenix takes Paddington’s paw and together they PULL A LEVER
which starts the FAIRGROUND ORGAN.

Paddington stares in awe as thousands of light bulbs burst
into life and the magnificent old rides start moving.

He is about to go off and explore when Phoenix takes him to
one side and starts probing him for information.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
Young bear! Young bear! A word in
your ear. This pop-up book...

PADDINGTON
Do you know it?

PHOENIX
I know of it but I was led to
believe it was lost. Where on earth
did you find it?

PADDINGTON
Mr Gruber’s Antique Shop. He’s
keeping it to one side for me but I
really need a job. I don’t suppose
you have any advice, do you?

PHOENIX
Not really, no. I suppose you’1ll
just have to... start at the bottom

of the ladder and work your way up.
PADDINGTON

Do you know what, Mr Buchanan?

You've just given me a brilliant

idea.

PHOENIX
Have I?

PADDINGTON
I’m going to be a window cleaner!
EXT. WINDSOR GARDENS - DAY

Paddington sets to work. He opens his suitcase, takes out a
TELESCOPIC LADDER and extends it against the side of a house.

Next, he pulls out a COLLAPSIBLE BUCKET and POPS IT OPEN.
28

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 23.

He adds a DASH OF SOAP and fills it from an OUTSIDE TAP.

He tries to CLIMB THE LADDER with the bucket - but the bucket
is so heavy he CAN'T LIFT IT OFF THE FLOOR.

He has an idea. He gets a LENGTH OF ROPE out of his suitcase
and ties one end to the bucket.

Next he CLIMBS THE LADDER, feeds the rope through a DRAINPIPE
attached to the wall, closes his eyes and JUMPS OFF.

But he’s not heavy enough - and opens his eyes to find
himself dangling in space.

He looks around, wondering how to make himself heavier.

PADDINGTON
Erm... Ah!

He spots a flowerpot on the window ledge and grabs it.

His weight is now just enough to raise the bucket up and
lower him to the ground.

Delighted with his success, he puts the flowerpot down.

Unfortunately, of course, the pot was the only thing making
Paddington heavier than the bucket three storeys above.

And so, to his surprise, PADDINGTON finds himself RISING UP
the building as the BUCKET DESCENDS.

He ends up DANGLING from the top of the building while three
floors below, the BUCKET HITS THE FLOOR.

As it lands, SOME OF THE WATER SLOSHES OUT. Unfortunately,
that means Paddington is now MUCH HEAVIER THAN THE BUCKET.

He DESCENDS - fast - and LANDS IN A HEAP on the floor.

Dazed, he lets go of the rope so the BUCKET - and all its
soapy contents - PLUMMETS onto the unfortunate bear's HEAD.

The bucket seems to be stuck fast.

Dazed, he staggers off around the corner, covered in soap,
the bucket still firmly wedged on his head.

INT. DR JAFRI’S HOME OFFICE - MORNING

DR JAFRI is doing some paperwork at his desk. Behind him,
through the French Windows, we can see a very soapy bear

staggering through the garden.

Dr Jafri looks up as Paddington BUMPS INTO THE FRENCH
WINDOWS, the impact finally sending the bucket flying off.
29

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 24.

Paddington sees Dr Jafri, staring at him.

Trying to cover up his mistake, he starts POLISHING THE
WINDOWS WITH HIS FUR, using himself as a CHAMOIS LEATHER.

Dr Jafri watches as Paddington smears soap on the window with
his belly then wipes the windows with his back.

They are now sparkling. And the doctor is delighted.

INT. PADDINGTON’S ATTIC ROOM - DAY

Paddington puts his first coins in a HUGE JAR. On it is a
label - “AUNT LUCY’S BIRTHDAY FUND”.

EXT. WINDSOR GARDENS - DAY (MONTAGE)

TIME-LAPSE of Paddington cleaning all the windows along the
street. He ends up at the Colonel’s where he rings the bell.

PADDINGTON
Window cleaner!

COLONEL (0.S.)
No thank you.

PADDINGTON
Are you sure, Colonel? They’re
awfully dirty.

COLONEL (0.S.)
I don’t care and I’m not paying.

PADDINGTON
(to himself)
Perhaps I‘1l clean them anyway.
INT. COLONEL’S HOUSE - DAY
The Colonel drinks tea in his gloomy living room.
Suddenly he feels a warm light on his face.

He looks up to see Paddington cleaning the window, sunlight
washing into the room for the first time in years.

He goes to the window and looks out. Miss Kitts waves to him
from the news stand. He tentatively waves back.

She does a mime for his entertainment, pretending to go into
the basement of the kiosk. He reciprocates by miming being in
an elevator. They laugh, a connection beginning to form.

Suddenly the mood is shattered by a rap at the door. The
Colonel opens it to find MR CURRY wearing a HI-VIZ JACKET and
HAT, a megaphone attached to his belt.

MR CURRY
Good afternoon, Colonel. Are you
aware there’s a bear on your roof?

COLONEL
Yes, he’s cleaning my windows.

MR CURRY
Well it’s not for me to say, sir,
but I wouldn’t care to have an
undesirable crawling all over my
roof - and as Commander of your
Community Defence Force--

COLONEL
Is that an official position, Mr
Curry? Or have you just got
yourself a yellow coat?

He slams the door in Mr Curry’s face.

INT. PADDINGTON’S ATTIC ROOM - VARIOUS DAYS (MONTAGE)

A sequence of jump cuts shows coins going into the HUGE JAR
on different days.

EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - VARIOUS DAYS

- Paddington cleans Wolfie who has never looked better.

- Paddington washes the windscreen of the dustbin lorry,
clinging onto the wipers. The BINMAN reads his A-Z inside.

- Paddington in scuba gear squeegees the inside of an
aquarium. He waves to the CYCLIST who works there.

- Henry, at work in a high office, is startled to see
Paddington cleaning the window.

- Pull back to reveal he’s cleaning the whole of the Shard. A
CALYPSO BAND are in the Gondola, playing as the song ends.
EXT. GRUBER’S ANTIQUES - NIGHT

Paddington walks home past Mr Gruber’s as a distant clock
chimes four.

He stops and peers through the window at the pop-up book in a
glass case and smiles to himself.

PADDINGTON
One more day, Aunt Lucy.

But just then he hears the sound of BREAKING GLASS.

He goes round to the alley next to the shop and spots a
SHADOWY FIGURE climbing through a second floor window.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Mr Gruber?!

Startled, the figure turns to reveal he’s a BEARDED THIEF.

THIEF
Who?

PADDINGTON
You-- You’re not Mr Gruber!

THIEF
Lorks!

The thief climbs through the window, but Paddington sets off
in pursuit. He runs to the window and winds up his ladder.

PADDINGTON
Oh no you don’t!
INT. GRUBER’S ANTIQUES - NIGHT
The thief runs downstairs, smashes the display case
containing the pop-up book and grabs it.
INT. MR GRUBER'S UPSTAIRS WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Paddington tumbles through the window into Mr Gruber's
workshop - but suddenly the BURGLAR ALARM shrieks into life.

Paddington goes to the window and sees the thief BURST OUT OF
THE FRONT DOOR and down the road CARRYING THE POP-UP BOOK.

PADDINGTON
Stop! Thief!
INT. GRUBER'S ANTIQUES - NIGHT
Paddington careers down the stairs and out of the shop.

PADDINGTON
Come back with that book!

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - NIGHT
A POLICE CAR pulls up at the top of Portobello Road as
Paddington bolts down the road.
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
A serious-minded POLICEWOMAN grabs the radio.
POLICEWOMAN
Robbery in progress at Gruber's
Antiques. Suspect is a small bear

in a red hat and a duffle coat!

She gets out and gives chase.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD / ALLEY - NIGHT

Paddington chases the thief down an alley towards the canal.

EXT. CANAL TOWPATH - NIGHT

Paddington emerges from the alley onto the towpath. He looks
around and sees the thief taking a bicycle from on top of a
canal boat and cycling away.

Paddington puts his paw in his mouth and WHISTLES!

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Wolfie pricks up his ears and runs.

EXT. CANAL TOWPATH - NIGHT

Paddington emerges from a tunnel RIDING THE DOG LIKE A HORSE,
galloping after the thief - who has the book in a PANIER on
the back of his bicycle.

Paddington pulls alongside the bicycle and reaches for the
book. But just as he takes it, the thief notices what is
going on and grabs the book before Paddington can get away.

The pair tussle for the book - but suddenly, the thief VEERS
OFF up an incline and across a BRIDGE AHEAD OF PADDINGTON.

The pair of them are now on different sides of the canal as
they head to the basin. And the thief is pulling away.

But Paddington isn’t done yet. He spurs the dog into life.

They LEAP UP onto the ROOF OF A BOAT moored by the towpath
and JUMP ONTO AN ISLAND in the middle of the canal basin.
44

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 28.

They crash through the undergrowth. Ducks, geese and other
birds fly up in to the air, squawking wildly.

PADDINGTON
Excuse me! Coming through! Who are
you?!

The thief looks round to see PADDINGTON EMERGE from the
undergrowth HANGING FROM THE LEGS OF A SWAN.

THIEF
Strike a light!

Amazed by the sight, he LOSES CONTROL OF THE BIKE, and falls
off as it goes in the water.

High above, hanging from the swan, Paddington watches the
thief get to his feet and run off the canal.

PADDINGTON
That book is reserved for Aunt
Lucy! Oh er, hello there.
The swan has looked round and starts pecking at Paddington.
PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Ooh! Ow! Not the snout! Help
Wolfie!
Paddington lets go and falls to the towpath beneath.

Fortunately, he lands on the back of the dog and together,
they race once more after the thief.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Thank you, Wolfie! Attaboy!
EXT. WINDSOR SQUARE - NIGHT
Paddington follows the thief towards the newspaper kiosk.

The thief stops as he hears a police sirens heading towards
him from the other direction.

Cornered, he raises his hands, still holding the pop-up book.
THIEF
(breathless)
Alright, alright! You got me.
Paddington gets off the dog and walks towards him.

PADDINGTON
Hand over the book!

THIEF
‘Fraid I can’t do that. Cheerio.
45

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 29.

The thief turns and then suddenly... POOF!
He quite literally DISAPPEARS IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.

PADDINGTON
But... where did he go?

Paddington looks around, astounded, as police cars close in
from all directions - and then hears a voice behind him.

POLICEWOMAN

Hold it right there!
PADDINGTON

Oh, thank goodness you’re here!
POLICEWOMAN

Put your... paws in the air.

Paddington lifts his paws in the air.

PADDINGTON
But... I’m not the thief! I was

chasing the thief and then he...
POLICEWOMAN
(sarcastically)

Disappeared in a puff of smoke?

PADDINGTON
Well... yes.

EXT. WINDSOR GARDENS - MOMENTS LATER

Paddington’s friends and neighbours come to their windows as
the Policewoman leads him up the street in HANDCUFFS.

The little bear hangs his head in shame.

The Browns run out of their house, frantic, but a Policeman
holds them back.

MARY
Paddington!

HENRY
Please, there must be a mistake.

POLICEMAN
No mistake sir.

MRS BIRD
What’s going on?

POLICEMAN
Caught red-handed robbing Gruber’s
Antiques.
46

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 30.

MR CURRY

Well, well, well. The truth is out.
We opened our hearts to that bear,
we opened our doors - well, you
did, I kept mine triple locked in
accordance with the guidelines -
and all along he was robbing you
blind. I hate to say I told you so,
but I did definitely tell you so.

The neighbours mutter to each other. Can this be true?
The door of the police van is SLAMMED SHUT.

Paddington is driven away, his little face pressed against
the barred rear window, a picture of fear and shame.

INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

The BEARDED THIEF sits in front of a theatrical MAKE-UP
MIRROR. He talks to himself in a gruff London accent.

THIEF
A nice little haul, and no mistake.

The Thief PULLS AT HIS NOSE - and it PEELS OFF HIS FACE. His
EYEBROWS follow, and finally his BEARD.

THIEF (CONT'D)
Turned out to be quite a stroke of
luck, that bear turning up when he
did. Coppers think he done it, and
we're in the clear.

His WIG comes off to reveal the Thief is PHOENIX IN DISGUISE.

PHOENIX
Indeed, Magwich. We gave quite a
performance, you and I. Just like
the old days.

Phoenix catches sight of a COSTUMED MANNEQUIN in the mirror,
dressed like Hamlet with a skull in one hand.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
Why the lemon face, Hamlet? If you
have something to say, please,
share it with us all.

Phoenix stands and we find the room is full of MANNEQUINS,
all the great characters he has played over the years. He
walks among them, addressing them as if they were real.

PHOENIX AS HAMLET
It is not nor it cannot come to
good.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 31.

PHOENIX
Oh really, you and your dreary
conscience. Tell me this. What
would you prefer? That you sit
here, gathering dust, while I
humiliate myself in a spaniel
costume on the television - or that
we all return in glory with the
greatest one man show the West End
has ever seen?

The sound of an enormous audience applauding floats through
Phoenix’s mind as he imagines himself lapping up praise.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
I know what you’re thinking,
Scrooge, it’1ll cost a fortune, but
if I’m right, that’s exactly what
this book will provide. This is no
dusty old antique. Hidden on every
page, a little lady, pointing to a
clue. Find all the clues, we're
rich again, and our dog food days
are done...

CUTAWAY: INT. ARISTOCRATIC DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A SILVER CLOCHE sits on a linen clothed table. A BUTLER'S
HAND removes the cover - to reveal a GILT DOG FOOD BOWL.

BUTLER
Dinner is served, master.

We pull out to reveal Phoenix dressed in a DOG SUIT.

PHOENIX
Thank you, Simpkins.

Phoenix turns and speaks to camera.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
If, like me, your dog likes to
maintain standards, may I recommend
Harley's Gourmet din-dins? More
taste, more goodness, more - dare I
say - class?

He puts a forkful of dog food into his mouth and struggles to
pull a contended expression.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
Mmm! Woof!

EXT. COURTROOM - DAY

Various legal types walk towards a courtroom.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Paddington stands alone in the dock, confused and afraid. The
Browns and his friends are all in attendance.

CLERK OF COURT
All rise!

PADDINGTON
(to himself)
Deep breath, Paddington. Remember
what Mr Brown said. You’re young,
you've done nothing wrong, you'll
be fine - so long as you get a fair-
minded judge.

JUDGE
Order! Order!

But he looks up to see the judge is the same man from the
barber’s shop - and he’s monumentally annoyed.

PADDINGTON
Oh dear.

JUDGE
We will now hear the case of the
Crown versus Paddington Brown.

First, MR GRUBER gives evidence.
MR GRUBER

...oh yes, he loved the book. He
had set his heart on top of it.

PROSECUTOR
So you discussed how expensive it
was?

MR GRUBER

Yes, but he was raising the money!
I refuse to believe young Mr Brown
would ever burglarize my shop.

Paddington is delighted to see his friend stand up for him.

Next, a FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR is on the stand. He gestures to
a plan of Gruber’s Antiques.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 33.

FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR
Paw-prints were found here, here,
and here, and a substance, later
identified as marmalade, was found
here.

The Prosecutor produces a jar of Paddington’s marmalade.

PROSECUTOR
And is this the same marmalade?

The Forensic Investigator dips his finger in the jar and rubs
it around his gums, like a cop testing for cocaine.

FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR
Yes it is.

The court gasp, the tide starting to turn against Paddington.

PROSECUTOR
Thank you very much.

She steps away with the jar, but the Forensic Investigator
snatches it off her and starts eating more marmalade.

FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR
Thank you very much.
(off her look)
This evidence is very more-ish.

Finally, PHOENIX takes the stand.

CLERK OF COURT
Phoenix Buchanan, do you swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

PHOENIX
May my entrails be plucked forth
and wound about my neck should I
deceive, I do. Prison is no
laughing matter. And I should know.
I spent three years in Les
Miserables.

The court laugh.

PROSECUTOR
Mr Buchanan, you live on the same
street as the defendant.

PHOENIX
Yes, I have known the family for
years. Henry and Mary and the
unforgettable Mrs Fuh nuh nuh.

Mrs Bird rolls her eyes.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 34.

PROSECUTOR
And you were an eye-witness to the
events that night.

PHOENIX
Indeed I was.

Everyone leans forward, keen to hear what he has to say.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
I was up late writing my one man
show when I became aware of a
hullaballoo in the street below. I
went to my awards room, which is a
large room overlooking the kiosk,
and I saw young Paddington riding a
rather disreputable looking hound.

The Prosecutor produces a PENCIL DRAWING of the thief.

PROSECUTOR
Mary Brown drew this based on the
bear's description of the man he
claims he was chasing.

Phoenix looks admiringly at the face in the picture.

PHOENIX
Ooh, handsome devil, isn’t he?
Strong cheekbones, noble forehead,
dazzling eyes...

PROSECUTOR
Yes but did you see him? Your
answer will tell us whether the
bear is guilty. Did you see this
man?

Paddington leans forward, desperate to be cleared.

PHOENIX
Alas... I did not.

The court descends into uproar. The Browns despair.
PHOENIX (CONT'D)
But perhaps he had already
vanished! I beg you, go easy on
him. He is but a cub.
Alone in the dock, Paddington has lost all hope.

INT. PRISON ATRIUM - NIGHT

Paddington stands behind a BARRED DOOR wearing a GREY STRIPED
PRISON UNIFORM and hat. He carries a ROLLED BLANKET.

A STERN WARDEN addresses him.

WARDEN
Paddington Brown. Ten years for
Grand Theft...

PADDINGTON
Oh, but I never...

WARDEN
And Grievous Barberly Harm.

Paddington growls, unable to argue with that one.

WARDEN (CONT'D)
Follow me.

A buzzer sounds. The barred door SLIDES OPEN.

SAD CALYPSO MUSIC plays as Paddington follows a Warden
anxiously into the HIGH PRISON ATRIUM and up a staircase.

There, in the Atrium, are the Calypso Band, wearing prison
uniforms and singing a jailhouse lament.

The Warden unlocks a cell door and Paddington steps inside.

PADDINGTON
Mrs Brown usually reads me a story
before bed. I don’t suppose...

WARDEN
Sorry, son. No bedtime stories in
here.

The Warden slams the door shut behind him.

INT. PADDINGTON'S PRISON CELL - NIGHT

Paddington climbs up to a pipe under the window, and starts
to write a letter.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
Dear Aunt Lucy. A great deal has
happened since I last wrote. I’m
afraid there’s been a bit of a mix
up with your present and the upshot
is I’ve had to leave Windsor

It’s not quite as charming as the
Browns’ house but it’s not all bad.
It’s a period property - in fact,
it’s one of the most substantial
Victorian buildings in London - and

The iconic landmark silhouetted against the night sky.

INT. NORTH TOWER, TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

A whistling SECURITY GUARD walks past VARIOUS ROYAL SUITS OF
ARMOUR on display in front of a large, Gothic window.

As soon as the guard has left the room, one of the suits
MOVES, lifting up its visor to reveal Phoenix.

He runs clanking out of the room.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Still wearing the armour, Phoenix climbs out of a window and
clanks along the elevated walkway above the bridge to the

The Thames swirls below. Phoenix takes a closer look at the

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Good morning. How would you like to
start a gardening club?

T-BONE
How would you like to be buried in
a very deep hole?

Paddington wouldn’t like that at all so falls silent. They
pass the Warden, who gives them their jobs as they go.

WARDEN
Brown, P. Laundry Duty!
INT. PRISON LAUNDRY - DAY

FOUR INDUSTRIAL WASHING MACHINES dominate a basement laundry,
labelled “BEDDING”, “TOWELS”, “UNIFORMS”, “COLOURS”.

Paddington looks around, trying to find the laundry.
PADDINGTON
Laundry. Laundry... laundry... Ah!
Laundry.
Paddington spots a button on the wall marked “Laundry.”

A distant mechanical clanking suggests activity, but only
after a few seconds does Paddington spot the hatch above him.

He looks up just as the hatch opens, covering him in an
AVALANCHE OF CLOTHES.

He emerges from the pile, hiccups, and pulls a SINGLE RED
SOCK from his mouth.

Horrified, he throws the sock away, but it lands on his hat.
Paddington sets about loading the machines and starting them.
He takes off his own clothes, throws them into the UNIFORMS

MACHINE and starts it. Pleased with his work, he turns away,

then freezes as he remembers something.

He turns slowly back to the machine to see the SINGLE RED
SOCK in the uniforms wash.

He TRIES TO OPEN THE DOOR but it is locked. He heaves on the
handle with all his might - but it SNAPS OFF.

He stares into the window of the washing machine, the water
turning an OMINOUS PINK.

Oh it’s only one red sock. What’s
the worst that could happen?

63 INT. PRISON CANTEEN - DAY

A room of hardened prisoners, all wearing BRIGHT PINK
UNIFORMS, glare fiercely at Paddington.

PADDINGTON
Afternoon chaps. If you ask me, the
pink really brightens the place up
a bit.

T-BONE
If you ask me, you should pipe down
and eat your dinner, ‘cos it might
be your last.

Paddington gulps.

PADDINGTON
Ok.

He walks towards the tables, his tray RATTLING IN FEAR.

He sits at a vacant spot, doffs his hat to the prisoners on
either side, then looks at the DISGUSTING SLOP on his plate.

He lifts a spoonful to his nose and sniffs. It’s bad.
A friendly looking Australian prisoner smiles encouragingly.
PHIBS
Don’t worry. I used to be a
restaurant critic. It’s not as bad

as it looks.

PADDINGTON
Oh.

Paddington eats a spoonful - and sicks up into his mouth.

PHIBS
-..it’s worse.

PADDINGTON
What is this?

Spoon, a wise, worldly man who’s seen it all before, leans
over. He is making a MODEL OF A WINDMILL with matchsticks.

Why doesn’t someone have a word

A dozy looking prisoner, THE PROFESSOR, drops his mug.

PROFESSOR

SPOON
Two things to remember if you want
to survive in here. Keep your head
down, and never talk to Knuckles.

PADDINGTON
Thank you.

A quiet prisoner, CHARLEY RUMBLE, GROWLS in agreement - but a
devious plan has occurred to T-Bone.

Well I think it’s a great idea.
Tell you what son, you get Knuckles
to change the menu, and we might
forget about you making us look
like a bunch of pink flamingos.

Paddington is delighted at the prospect of making peace.

PADDINGTON
Alright then, I will.

He looks round at the chef, a mountain of a man in a STRIPED
CHEF’S APRON and HAT, his back turned towards us.

Undeterred, Paddington gets to his feet.

PHIBS
Mate, I really wouldn’t...

PADDINGTON
Aunt Lucy said if you look for the
good in people, you'll find it.
The other prisoners watch as he walks over to the counter.

SPOON
She obviously never met Knuckles.

The Prisoners go quiet as Paddington reaches Knuckles. He
raps on the counter.

PADDINGTON
Erm, excuse me, Mr Knuckles?
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 41.

Knuckles turns to reveal a huge, granite-faced bruiser. This
is a man who has faced a thousand enemies and defeated them
all except, perhaps, himself.

KNUCKLES
Yes?

The Warden whispers nervously into his radio.

WARDEN

Send a medic to the canteen.
PADDINGTON

I... just wondered if I could have

a quick word about the food?

KNUCKLES
You want to complain?

PADDINGTON
Oh, no, I- I wouldn’t say complain.

KNUCKLES
That’s a shame. Because I just love
it when people complain.

Knuckles’ huge fist closes around a wooden ROLLING PIN on the
counter - but Paddington doesn’t detect the threat.

PADDINGTON
Really? Oh! Well in that case, it’s
very gritty. And lumpy. And as for
the bread...

He picks up a baguette and bonks it against Knuckles’ head,
knocking his hat askew.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Need I say more? I think we need to
completely overhaul the menu. Now I
know we’re working to a tight
budget but we could at least add
some sauce.

He picks up a bottle of ketchup and accidentally squirts some
onto Knuckles’ apron. Knuckles slowly looks down.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Oops. Sorry about that I’1l just...

He tries to wipe it off but the stain just spreads.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
No that’s just rubbing it in. Don’t
worry. I know what gets ketchup
stains out.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 42.

He picks up a mustard bottle, squirts some onto the stain,
then immediately has second thoughts.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Hang on, was it mustard?
(he tries wiping)
Mmm no. That’s just made it worse!
Does anyone know what works on
ketchup?

He turns to the other prisoners - to find they are all HIDING
UNDER THEIR TABLES.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Chaps?

WARDEN
Forget the medic.

The penny slowly drops as Paddington turns back to Knuckles -
who SNAPS THE ROLLING PIN IN TWO.

WARDEN (CONT’D)
Better send a priest.

Knuckles GRABS PADDINGTON and LIFTS HIM OFF THE COUNTER.

KNUCKLES
Now you listen to me, you little
maggot!

PADDINGTON
Listening.

KNUCKLES
Nobody criticises my food.

PADDINGTON
Right.

KNUCKLES
Nobody squirts condiments on my
apron.

PADDINGTON
Got it.

KNUCKLES
Nobody bonks me on the head with a
baguette!

PADDINGTON
No bonking.

KNUCKLES
I‘1l overhaul the menu alright.

PADDINGTON
Really?

KNUCKLES
Dish of the day?

PADDINGTON
Yes?

KNUCKLES
Bear pie.

PADDINGTON

I don’t like it!

Paddington takes his SANDWICH out of his HAT and PUSHES IT
INTO KNUCKLES' MOUTH - and shuts his eyes, awaiting the end.

But Knuckles CHEWS. And astonishment creeps across his face.

KNUCKLES
What is this?
PADDINGTON
It's a marmalade sandwich.
KNUCKLES
Marmalade?
PADDINGTON

My Aunt Lucy taught me to make it.

Knuckles lowers Paddington onto the counter as he eats.

KNUCKLES

You mean... you can make this?
PADDINGTON

Well... yes.
KNUCKLES

Stand aside.
Paddington nods. Knuckles makes a declaration to the room.

KNUCKLES (CONT’D)
Get off the floor, you bunch of
yellow-bellies and listen to me!
This bear is now under my
protection. Anyone touches a hair
on his back’1l answer to Knuckles
McGinty. That’s Knuckles with a
capital ‘N’.

Knuckles brandishes his fists. Across eight knuckles are the
letters of his name: NUCKEL’S.

T-Bone is frustrated that his plan has been thwarted.

PADDINGTON
Thank you, Mr McGinty.

KNUCKLES
Don’t thank me yet. I don’t do
nuthin’ for no one for nuthin’.

PADDINGTON
Beg your pardon?

KNUCKLES
You get my protection - so long as
you make that marmalade. Deal?

Knuckles SPITS ON HIS HAND and proffers it to Paddington.

Paddington, puzzled, SPITS ON KNUCKLES’ HAND TOO.

PADDINGTON
Deal.

INT. GRUBER’S ANTIQUES - DAY

Mary is putting up a poster in Mr Gruber’s window.

MARY
Somebody's got to recognise him
sooner or later.

MR GRUBER
(in his own world)
Hmm.
MARY
Are you alright Mr Gruber?
MR GRUBER
Oh I’m probably just being a
nincompoop...
MARY

Why? What is it?

MR GRUBER
There’s something about this whole
business that’s been tickling my
brain-box.

MARY
Oh yes?

She picks up a pad, takes a pen out of her hair and licks it.

MR GRUBER
Let me take you back to the night
of the robbery. When young Mr Brown
called out, the thief took to his
heels and ran downstairs...
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 45.

As Mr Gruber talks, an animation of Mary’s ILLUSTRATION OF
THE THIEF appears in the shop.

MARY
..-and went straight through the
front doors, setting off the alarm.

The Illustrated Thief grabs the book and leaves.

MR GRUBER
Ah, but he didn’t go straight
through the doors! He came all the
way over here to get the popping
book. Why not some jewellery or a
vase? He can’t have known much
about antiques.

MARY
Or maybe he knew something about
that book that we don’t...

65 EXT. KOSLOVA’S STEAM FAIR - NIGHT

The Browns are talking to the OWNER OF THE FAIRGROUND, a
colourfully-dressed Russian who works as the FORTUNE TELLER.

MARY
You may find this hard to believe,
Madame Koslova, but Paddington is
innocent - and we think the real
thief may have broken in just to
take that book.

MADAME KOZLOVA
The pop-up book?

HENRY
We know it sounds far-fetched...

MARY
But anything you could tell us
about it could be useful.

MADAME KOZLOVA
There’s quite a story.

MARY
Really?

Mary is fascinated, Henry skeptical.

MADAME KOZLOVA
Come with me I’1l show you where it
all happened. You see, my Great-—
Grandmother, who started this fair,
was the greatest show-woman of her
generation.

MADAME KOZLOVA (CONT'D)
She could tame lions, breathe fire,
swallow swords, but she was most
famous for the trapeze.

As Madame Kozlova walks up to the Spiegeltent, the camera
pushes inside, where we find ourselves in the 1930s...
INT. SPIEGELTENT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
A crowd of people watch MADAME KOZLOVA perform above them.
MADAME KOZLOVA (V.O.)
They called her the Flying Swan.
Wherever she went, she was showered

with gifts, and made a fortune.

As Madame Kozlova takes the applause, people throw flowers.
One RICH MAN in a fur cape tosses her a DIAMOND NECKLACE.

MADAME KOZLOVA (V.O.)
But where there is a fortune, there
is also jealousy.

In the wings stands a MAGICIAN, watching on enviously.

INT. SPIEGELTENT - LATER THAT NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The Spiegeltent is empty. The Magician stands by the trapeze
ropes, filing through them.

MADAME KOZLOVA (V.O.)
The magician wanted it for himself,
so one night he cut through the
ropes - and the Flying Swan became
the Dying Swan.
INT. SPIEGELTENT - THE NEXT NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Madame Kozlova is performing her act when the rope snaps -
and she PLUMMETS TO THE FLOOR.

The Magician rushes over to where she lies, pretending to be

concerned, but surreptitiously pulls a KEY CHAIN from around
her neck - and slips away through the crowd.

EXT. MADAME KOZLOVA’S CARAVAN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The Magician darts up the steps into the painted wagon.

INT. MADAME KOZLOVA’S CARAVAN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The Magician uses the key to open the strong box.
71

Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 47.

MADAME KOZLOVA (V.O.)
He went to her caravan and opened
her strong box - but instead of her
treasure, all he found was a pop-up
book: Twelve Landmarks of London.

He leafs through the pop-up book, baffled.

Suddenly, a STAGE HAND bursts in with a couple of POLICEMEN.
The rest of the fairground workers aren’t far behind.

MADAME KOZLOVA (V.O.)
They had him cornered - but he
disappeared in a puff of smoke, and
neither he, nor the treasure, were
ever seen again.

Suddenly, just like Phoenix in Windsor Gardens, the magician
disappears in a PUFF OF SMOKE, leaving the book behind.

INT. HENRY AND MARY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mary is sitting on the bed, Henry is out of sight in their en-
suite bathroom.

MARY
I knew there was something special
about that pop-up book.

HENRY (0.S.)
Hm?

MARY
Why else would she have kept it in
her strong box?

Henry emerges from the bathroom in a BLUE FACE MASK.

HENRY (0.S.)
You're not telling me you believed
all that guff are you?

He starts rubbing it off.

MARY
Madame Koslova drew twelve London
landmarks in that book. Well what
if they’re not just landmarks. What

if they’re... I don’t know, clues?
HENRY

Clues?!
MARY

To where she hid her fortune!
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17

HENRY
You mean... a treasure map?

MARY
Exactly!

Henry turns away, rolling his eyes.

MARY (CONT'D)
And that’s why the thief took it
from Mr Gruber’s. First thing
tomorrow we need to go every
landmark in that pop-up book, see
if we can sniff out anything
suspicious.

HENRY
Too many adventure stories Mary.

MARY
What?

HENRY
She’s a fortune teller! She spun
you a yarn. It’s what they do.

MARY
Honestly darling, you’re so close-
minded these days.

HENRY
What’s that supposed to mean?

MARY
What happened to the man I married?
He’d have believed me.

Henry checks his crow’s feet in the mirror.

HENRY
Oh him! He’s gone Mary. I’m afraid
your husband's just a creaky old
man, not Bullseye Brown.

Henry looks in the mirror and imagines himself back in his

heyday, standing at a COCONUT SHY.

He throws a ball and knocks over three different coconuts.

YOUNG HENRY
Bullseye.

YOUNG MARY
Oh Henry!

MARY
Henry? Henry!
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 49.

Henry snaps out of his reverie and picks up a poster.

HENRY
But the point is we’re not going to
help Paddington by going on a wild
goose chase. We’re looking for this
scruffy chancer, not some
swashbuckling pirate hunting for
buried treasure.

Mary stares at the poster, her theory taking shape.
MARY
Well I think there’s more to him
than meets the eye...

72 INT. PHOENIX’S ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Phoenix sits at his make-up mirror, readying himself for a
new disguise.

MARY (V.O.)
I think he somehow knew the story
of the Koslova fortune and is out
there now, trying to find it...

Phoenix looks up at an OLD PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MAGICIAN from
Madame Kozlova’s story.

PHOENIX
Well, grandfather, tonight we take
another step closer. The setting,
St. Paul’s Cathedral.

The pop-up book stands on the dressing table, open at St.
Paul’s Cathedral.

MATCH CUT TO:

73 EXT. ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
A flock of nuns process up the steps.
PHOENIX (V.O.)
But how to enter unobserved? Enter
Sister Agatha...

74 INT. ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

The nuns process through the cathedral. One of them is
PHOENIX, DISGUISED IN A HABIT.

He ducks out of the procession and slips into a staircase,
his habit covering the camera and taking us into darkness.

KNUCKLES (0.S.)

Paddington opens his eyes to find Knuckles inches from his
nose. Thunder crashes in the distance.

KNUCKLES (CONT’D)
Marmalade time.

INT. PRISON CANTEEN - NIGHT

The Warden lets Paddington and Knuckles into the canteen,
locking the door behind them.

PADDINGTON
Um... Mr McGinty? Mr McGinty?
KNUCKLES
What do you want?
PADDINGTON
Well, the thing is, I’m actually
innocent.
KNUCKLES
Ha!
PADDINGTON

And I wondered if you had any
advice on how to clear my name? Now
that we’re friends...

KNUCKLES
Friends? I’m your boss, not your
buddy.

PADDINGTON

Oh. Well, after you.
Paddington holds the kitchen door open for Knuckles.

KNUCKLES
(suspicious)
Why? So you can stab me in the
back?

PADDINGTON
No. Because it's polite! Aunt Lucy
said if you’re kind and polite, the
world will be right.

KNUCKLES
You were ahead of me, now you’re
behind. That makes you a sap.

77 INT. PRISON KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Paddington follows him in to the kitchen.

KNUCKLES
Ingredients are over there.

He nods over to some shelves and flops into a chair.

PADDINGTON
Erm... aren’t you going to help?

KNUCKLES
Nope. Now get on with it.

PADDINGTON
But there’s five hundred hungry
prisoners coming for breakfast so
I’1l need a thousand juicy oranges--

KNUCKLES
And rule number one: no talking.

He opens a prison newspaper: The Hard Times.

Paddington starts HUMMING as he puts on his STRIPED APRON and
picks up a CHEF’S HAT. Knuckles slowly lowers his paper.

KNUCKLES (CONT’D)
Rule number two. No humming, or
singing or any other expressions of
bonhomie.

Paddington nods, wanting to stay on the right side of him.
Knuckles raises his paper and for two seconds, there’s peace.

But then he hears a STRAINING, HEAVING NOISE.

Knuckles lowers his paper and looks over to see Paddington
trying to heave a LARGE SACK OF ORANGES off a high shelf.

PADDINGTON
Ooh that’s heavy. Come on,
Paddington. Put your back into it.

He finally manages to PULL THE SACK OFF THE SHELF, but it
pulls all the other sacks with it, BURYING HIM COMPLETELY.

Knuckles begrudgingly goes over and with one hand lifts an
enormous sack to reveal Paddington underneath.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
These sacks are awfully heavy.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 52.

KNUCKLES
Take them one at a time, then.

PADDINGTON
Right! One at a--

Knuckles drops the sack of oranges back on top of him.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
--time.

Knuckles goes back to his paper, hoping for peace.

But behind him, Paddington carries a SINGLE ORANGE from the
shelf to the counter, padding on the floor as he goes.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
One juicy orange.

He walks back to the shelf. And returns with another orange.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Two juicy oranges.

Then back and forth once more.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Three juicy oranges. Four--

KNUCKLES
Now what are you doing?

PADDINGTON
Taking them one at a time.

Knuckles flies into a rage.

KNUCKLES
One SACK at a time!

PADDINGTON
I'm sorry, I’m finding this a very
stressful working environment. Aunt
Lucy said--

KNUCKLES
Aunt Lucy! I’ve had it up to here
with Aunt Lucy! She sounds like a
proper old bag to me.

Paddington slowly turns his head towards Knuckles.

PADDINGTON
I beg your pardon?
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 53.

KNUCKLES
I said, your Aunt Lucy sounds like
the most naive, gullible, mushy-
brained... What’s going on?

Paddington is giving Knuckles a HARD STARE. It is having a
remarkable effect, bringing him out in a cold sweat.

KNUCKLES (CONT’D)
What are you looking at me like
that for? It’s awful hot in here.
Are you hot? I’m hot. Did I leave
the oven on?

PADDINGTON
It’s called a Hard Stare. Aunt Lucy
taught me to do them when people
have forgotten their manners.

KNUCKLES
You don’t need to tell me about
hard stares, I practically invented
them. Pretty good for a bear
though, I'll give you that.

PADDINGTON
Now Mr McGinty, I may look like a
hardened criminal to you, but I
really am innocent. And if you’re
not going to help me clear my name,
you could at least help me make
this marmalade!

KNUCKLES
Alright, I'll help. I doubt I’1l be
much use to you though.
(holding up his fists)
These weren’t exactly made for
cooking.

PADDINGTON
Oh I don’t know. Looks to me like
you've got yourself a great pair of
orange squeezers.

KNUCKLES
Orange squeezers?

Paddington and Knuckles start to make marmalade. The camera
circles them, jumping forward each time it passes a pillar:

- Paddington selects the oranges from a pile while Knuckles
squeezes them dry, not even chopping them in half.

- Paddington and Knuckles stand at chopping boards, armed
with knives and a pile of orange peels.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 54.

PADDINGTON
Now we have to be very careful with
knives. Aunt Lucy said that
sensible bears...

Knuckles eviscerates dozens of peels at machine-gun speed.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Where on earth did you learn to use
a knife like that?

KNUCKLES
You don’t want to know.

PADDINGTON
Well it’s jolly good!

- Next, Paddington stirs the mixture while Knuckles tips in
the rind. They’re starting to work together.

KNUCKLES
Now?

PADDINGTON
Now!

- We move closer, circling around the BUBBLING, AMBER LIQUID
as they add sugar, cinnamon, chilli and lemon, Knuckles
becoming involved in the creative process.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Time for the sugar. That’s what
turns the juice into marmalade.

KNUCKLES
How much?

PADDINGTON
A lot. Same again. A squeeze of
lemon, a pinch of cinnamon, and
just a bit more sugar.

- Paddington pours in another huge amount of sugar. Knuckles
is surprisingly eager to know how they’ve got on.

KNUCKLES
Well? Is it good?

PADDINGTON
It’s too soon to tell. We’ll only
really know when it’s set.

They see a taped-off crime scene - containing the remnants of

(the Sleazy Guard from the Geographers’ Guild in Paddington.)

JUDY
Excuse me? What happened here?

SECURITY GUARD
A nun went berserk.

It happens.

He nods over to a chapel where A HUNDRED NUNS are being held.
One very elderly specimen totters away with a walking stick.

He finds the letter “A” engraved between the angel’s wings.

was doing up there, but she was

Phoenix swings down to the gallery flood, putting his whole
body weight on the rod which secures the statue to the wall.

The Professor puts a cake fork into the cake and then LEVERS
THE WHOLE PIECE into his mouth.

Paddington sets off once more and hands the Warden Spoon’s
Chocolate Roulade.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Care for a taste, Warden?

WARDEN
Thank you, Paddington!

We reach the end of the canteen and Paddington peels off but
the camera PUSHES THROUGH THE CLOCK MECHANISM...

INT. CLOCK - DUSK (MONTAGE)

Past the swinging pendulum as hours whizz by, then out into:

INT. PRISON ATRIUM - DUSK TO NIGHT (MONTAGE)

The camera glides down as the whole room is transformed.

Welcome mats appear outside the barred doors, along with
hanging baskets, bunting, and fairy lights.

Prisoners knit, dance, play chess and raise a giant crochet
banner which reads “PRISON SWEET PRISON”.
INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

The Warden sits in his office at the top of the prison clock
tower. By his desk is a MODEL OF THE PRISON.

He is reading a BEDTIME STORY into a microphone.
WARDEN
-..and it turned out the monster
wasn’t such a monster after all,
and they all lived happily ever
after. The end.
The prisoners chorus out like children wanting more.

PRISONERS
Aw!

WARDEN
Now now. You lot need your sleep.
INT. PADDINGTON'S PRISON CELL - NIGHT

Paddington is lying on his bed. We can hear the Warden’s
voice through the tannoy.

WARDEN (0.S.)
It’s visiting day tomorrow.

Paddington stares at a photograph of himself with the Browns
on his bedside table.

PADDINGTON
Visiting Day. I do hope you have
good news.
INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

Paddington sits in a small PRISON VISITING BOOTH.

Henry, Mary, Mrs Bird and the children are on the other side
of the glass, their voices coming through a SPEAKER.

Judy lays out the latest copy of her newspaper. It shows
VARIOUS SKETCHES of Phoenix disguised as the nun, a beefeater
and Henry V.

MARY
In the past month, these three
shadowy individuals have all been
seen snooping round three London
landmarks.

JUDY
We think the thief you saw is part
of a criminal gang...

JONATHAN
Using the pop-up book as a treasure
map!

HENRY

(still unconvinced)
Well, it’s a theory.

PADDINGTON
Do you know who they are?

MRS BIRD
Not yet, dearie.

KNUCKLES
Maybe I should take a look.

Knuckles has appeared in the window next to Paddington.

HENRY
Erm, I’m sorry this is a private
conversation.

PADDINGTON

It’s alright, Mr Brown, this is my
friend, Knuckles.

KNUCKLES

MARY
It’s so lovely to meet you all. I
must say it’s a great relief to
know Paddington’s already made such
sweet friends.

HENRY
Would you excuse us for a moment?

Henry PRESSES A SWITCH and the LIGHT GOES OUT on the Browns’
side of the booth. He turns to Mary.

HENRY (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

MARY
Talking to the nice men.

HENRY
‘Nice men’? Mary, we can’t trust
these people. I mean look at them!
Talk about a rogues’ gallery.
Hideous. As for that bearded baboon
in the middle, he hasn’t got two
brain cells to rub together...

KNUCKLES
We can still hear you, Mr Brown.

Henry freezes.

KNUCKLES (CONT’D)
That was the light you turned off.
Microphone’s on the other side. It
has “Microphone” written on it.

Judy flicks the light back on. Henry swallows nervously.

HENRY
Gentlemen. If I have offended you
in any way--

KNUCKLES
Don’t worry about it. We’re fond of
the little fella. And let’s face
it, if anyone can recognise a
criminal gang, it’s us.

JUDY
We'd be grateful for any help.

Judy shows them the pictures.

PADDINGTON
Well?

KNUCKLES

The other prisoners shake their heads and say ‘no’.

SIR GEOFFREY
I’m afraid I couldn’t possibly
comment.

KNUCKLES
I’m sorry to say it, kid, but your
friends are barking up the wrong
tree. A nun, a beefeater and a
king? Sounds more like a fancy
dress party than a criminal gang.

Paddington looks around, crestfallen.

PADDINGTON
Then what are we going to do now?

EXT. WINDSOR SQUARE - MORNING

Mary leaves the house, the first flakes of snow whirling in
the air around her.

Her head elsewhere, she steps out in front of the cyclist,
who nearly hits her and responds angrily.

CYCLIST
Watch where you're going!

Mary moves out of the way as the cyclist rides away.

MARY
Sorry!

CYCLIST
Sorry! I get grumpy when I haven’t
had breakfast!
Mary walks past Dr Jafri who leaves his house and freezes.

DR JAFRI
Keys! Keys, keys...

He races back to the door, but without Paddington to remind
him, he doesn’t make it in time.

DR JAFRI (CONT'D)
Bottoms!

Mary passes MR CURRY who is berating the BINMAN, sitting on
the back of the parked lorry, reading his A-Z Atlas.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 67.

MR CURRY
You can’t park here!

BINMAN
I’m not parked, I’m doing the bins.

MR CURRY
You're not doing the bins, you’re
studying - on council time. I’m
going to report you. And your hat.

Mary arrives at the kiosk. The Colonel is also there.

MARY
Morning, Miss Kitts. Colonel.

MISS KITTS
Morning, Mrs Brown.

Mary hands Miss Kitts a bundle of newspapers.

MARY
Judy asked me to drop these off.

MR CURRY
Propaganda!

COLONEL
Here comes trouble.

Mr Curry has spotted them and walks over.

MR CURRY
You are wasting your time trying to
peddle that rubbish. Everyone knows
your bear did it. And this street
is a far better place without him.

Wolfie barks, perhaps protesting Paddington’s innocence.

MR CURRY (CONT’D)
Oi! It’s that mangy dog!

He sets off in pursuit of Wolfie.

MR CURRY (CONT’D)
You are going to the pound, my son.
Barking without a license in a
built-up area. I'll ticket you!

Miss Kitts takes the papers from Mary.

MISS KITTS
Give ‘em here, Mary. I have to sell
them under the counter for obvious
reasons but people are buying them.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 68.

The Colonel pulls a copy from his inside pocket.

COLONEL
It’s a bloomin’ good read. Made a
few people round here think twice
about your young bear.

MISS KITTS
You just need to find that thief.

MARY
We're trying.

Miss Kitts’ parrot squawks.

MARY (CONT'D)
I don’t suppose you know where he
is, do you Feathers?

FEATHERS
He’s behind you!

MARY
I'm sorry?

PHOENIX (0.S.)
Mary!

Mary turns to see Phoenix has appeared on his balcony behind
her. He beckons her into the house.

MARY
Oh hello, Phoenix.

PHOENIX
Come on in. I want you to tell me
all about the investigation.

98 INT. PHOENIX’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Mary is sitting in Phoenix’s living room. It is lavishly
decorated with throws, rugs and paintings on the walls.

Among them is an enormous portrait of Phoenix standing on a
rock in the Highlands, dressed in a kilt.

MARY
Mysterious things have been
happening all over town.

PHOENIX
Oh yes?
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 69.

MARY
Strange people turning up at every
landmark in that book.

PHOENIX
Have they?

MARY
I don’t know. Perhaps it’s alla
coincidence. Henry says I let my
imagination get the better of me.

PHOENIX
Well you’re an artist Mary, like
me. Our imaginations run free, like
bison upon the plain. But I do fear
on this particular occasion, dear
old Henry might be right.

MARY
Really?

PHOENIX
But. I do have some news that might
turn your little frown upside down.
It looks (fingers, fingers,
fingers) as though the funding may
be coming through for my one man
show.

MARY
Oh. Right.

PHOENIX
An evening of monologue and song
featuring some of my better known
characters. How about a little
preview? Picture the scene.
Darkness. Then: Spotlight. Me.
Ping!

He starts to sing and dance. Mary stares, astonished.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
“Listen to the rain on the roof go
pit pitty pat...”

Even Phoenix can’t fail to notice Mary isn’t happy.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
Mary, what’s wrong? Don’t you like
musicals?

MARY
No it’s just... it seems so strange
that Paddington’s in prison and yet
life just carries on.

PHOENIX
Oh I know. It must be hard to

dazzling blue eyes.

Mary turns to him, stunned.

MARY
What did you say?

PHOENIX
The man on the poster. Your
wonderful drawing!

MARY
But... how did you know he had blue
eyes? It’s a pencil sketch!

Phoenix tries to back-pedal.

PHOENIX
Oh! Well I must have... coloured
him in!

As Mary stares at Phoenix, her many IDENTIKIT-STYLE DRAWINGS
flicker over his face. And the penny finally drops.

INT. BROWNS’ KITCHEN - DAY

Mary has just outlined her theory to the family - but Henry
is still not convinced.

HENRY
Phoenix Buchanan?!

MARY
He’s a master of disguise.

HENRY
She’s gone mad.

MARY
Think about it Henry. Somewhere out
there is the Koslova fortune.

HENRY
Alleged fortune.

MARY
And Knuckles said we weren't
looking for a criminal gang.

HENRY
Knuckles?

Because there was no gang.

It was one man.

MARY

And Feathers knew all along...

HENRY
Feathers? Who’s Feathers?

Mary realises she might have said too much.

MARY
Nobody?
HENRY
The parrot at the news stand?!
MARY
Erm...
HENRY

Can we return to planet earth for a
moment? Phoenix Buchanan is a
highly respected, award-winning
actor and a member of our Platinum
Club. He is not a petty thief.

Before Mary can get a word in edgeways, Henry continues.

HENRY (CONT'D)
But let’s just say I’m wrong, shall
we? And that the fortune teller,
career criminal and parrot are
right. May I remind you, you don’t
actually have any proof? If anyone
wants me, I shall be putting up
posters.

He leaves, slamming the door behind him.

JUDY
He’s right.

MRS BIRD
Well I believe you, Mary. Actors
are some of the most evil, devious
people on the planet. They lie for
a living. If we're going to catch
one, we’re going to need a
foolproof plan. And once I’ve put
this pie in the oven, I’11 tell you
one.

INT. PADDINGTON'S CELL - NIGHT

Paddington is lying in bed when he hears a metallic CLANG
followed by a Knuckles’ voice coming along the pipe.

KNUCKLES (0.S.)
Paddington? Paddington!

Paddington climbs up to the horizontal pipes running through
his cell. He opens a vent and can now hear Knuckles clearly.

PADDINGTON
Knuckles?

Paddington listens as Knuckles’ voice floats along the pipe.

KNUCKLES
Got a proposition for you, kid. Me
and the boys have been talking, and
it seems to us if you’re going to
clear your name, you’re going to
need our help.

SPOON
The Browns may mean well but...

PHIBS
It takes a thief to catch a thief.

KNUCKLES
Now if we could somehow get out of
here, hit the streets, we’d find
him soon enough.

PADDINGTON
But that would mean... escape?!

KNUCKLES
It certainly would. And we've got a
plan. But it’s a four man job and
we need your help. What do you say?

Paddington is sorely tempted - but remembers Aunt Lucy.

PADDINGTON
That's very kind, Knuckles, but I
don’t think Aunt Lucy would like
the idea of me busting out of
chokey and going on the lam. The
Browns will find the real thief. I
just need to be patient.

But Knuckles isn’t finished.

KNUCKLES
You may not want to hear this kid,
but sooner or later, the Browns
will forget you.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 73.

Paddington looks horrified at the suggestion - but despite
himself, the words begin to seep into his mind like poison.

PHIBS
They always do.

SPOON
They’1l miss one visit. Then two.

KNUCKLES
And before you know it, you won't
have a home to go back to.

Paddington shakes his head, refusing to believe.
PADDINGTON
You’re wrong, Knuckles. You're all
wrong. The Browns aren’t like that.
They’11 come tomorrow and they’11l
have good news, you'll see.

He closes the vent firmly. But Paddington is concerned.

101 EXT. THEATRICAL AGENT’S OFFICE - MORNING

Jonathan and Judy walk up to an office building carrying a
basket of pastries. They ring the buzzer.

JUDY
It’s Judy Brown from the Portobello
Express.
They are buzzed in.
102 INT. THEATRICAL AGENT’S OFFICE - MORNING

Jonathan and Judy sit in an office, the walls lined with
theatrical posters and actors’ photographs.

Behind the desk is FLICK FANSHAWE, a glamorous, no-nonsense
agent with show-business coursing through her veins. The
children are recording the conversation on DICTAPHONES.

FLICK
So what's this for, darlings? A
school newspaper?

JUDY
Yes, career profiles. We thought
the agent of the Phoenix Buchanan
would be really interesting.

The Postman is walking back to his van. Mrs Bird comes over.

MRS BIRD
Good morning, Marlon.

POSTMAN
Morning Mrs B. How’s Paddington?

MRS BIRD
Oh he’s a tough wee bear...

As Mrs Bird keeps him talking, Mary sneaks round the other
side of the van, carrying a HUGE BARKRIDGE’S HAMPER.

She checks the coast is clear, then climbs into the back of
the van and GETS INSIDE THE HAMPER.

POSTMAN
Well, I’d better get on.

MRS BIRD
Goodbye.

The Postman turns back to the van just as MARY CLOSES THE LID
FROM INSIDE. He sees the box and reads the address label.

JONATHAN
So when can we expect to see Mr
Buchanan back on stage?

FLICK
Phoenix?! I wouldn’t hold your
breath, darling. Don’t get me

won’t work with other people.
Thinks they dilute his talent.

From a telephone box across the road, Mrs Bird watches
Phoenix open the door and take delivery of the parcel.

She picks up the phone and dials.

Mary is rifling through Phoenix’s paperwork, not sure what
she’s looking for, when she spots a blank, used notepad.

left from the previous note.

book? He’s a millionaire!

Well that’s where you’re wrong. He
owes money all over town.

She thrusts some paperwork into Henry’s hands.

So he’s got a few bills, I mean

He hasn’t got a penny to his name.

Now come on. Let’s find that book

Phoenix is walking down the street. He realises he has
forgotten his cravat and turns back the way he’s come.

Henry and Mary stand at the top of the landing. They’ve
searched the whole house with no luck. Mary sighs.

MARY
We must be missing something.

Unless there’s nothing to find. Can
we please go?

They head downstairs. But suddenly, something catches Mary's
eye. In the landing carpet, there are TWO INDENTATIONS.

MARY
Look, Henry, the carpet!

He hoists her up to the ceiling where she presses a ceiling
panel - and it SWINGS OPEN.

A STEP LADDER UNFOLDS, its feet landing in the two divots.

MARY

It’s an attic.

behind them.

They peer over the banisters and see Phoenix going into the
bathroom at the back of the hall.

121 INT. PHOENIX’S HALLWAY - DAY
They get to the bottom of the stairs and run to the front
door but Phoenix turns back to the hall - so they have to
BOLT INTO THE LIVING ROOM to hide.
Phoenix walks through the hall and hears footsteps.

He grabs a WALKING STICK SWORD from the umbrella stand in the
hall and goes into the living room.

PHOENIX
Hello? Who goes there? Show
yourself! I am armed and schooled.

Everything seems normal - apart from one thing: HENRY'S LEGS
disappearing behind the sofa.

Henry sheepishly gets to his feet. He can’t help noticing
Phoenix is brandishing a sword.

perhaps not in your pyjamas, eh?

They all laugh far too much. Phoenix shuts the door and his
smile drops as he darts upstairs.

Phoenix bursts in. The POP-UP book is still there, locked in
his make-up table. He breaths a huge sigh of relief.

way across London and found every
one of her clever little clues.

Aye. But what do they mean?

know just where to play them.

He looks at the back cover of the book, which features a
picture of the FAIRGROUND ORGAN and the words ‘WHERE ALL YOUR
DREAMS COME TRUE.’

From outside, we can hear the Browns all talking at once.

124 INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The Browns and Mrs Bird are lined up at the counter, making
their case to the Policewoman who arrested Paddington.

POLICEWOMAN
Hold it, hold it! That is an
amazing story, but all you've
proved is that Phoenix Buchanan
keeps his old costumes. Bring me
some hard evidence, bring me the
book with his finger prints on it,
and you've got a case. But until
then, there’s nothing I can do. I’m
sorry.

INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

Paddington sits in the visiting booth, holding his paws. He
anxiously cranes his neck to look for the Browns.

But a klaxon sounds, marking the end of visiting. And nobody
has come for him.

All the lights go out.

Paddington is left in the dark.

INT. PADDINGTON’S CELL - NIGHT

Paddington lies on his bed gazing at the photograph of him
with the Browns.

As he does so, his face disappears from the picture. Now it’s
just the Browns, smiling out at him without their bear.

A SINGLE TEAR rolls down his nose and SPLASHES ON THE FLOOR.

But then, where the tear has fallen between two stone slabs,
a TINY GREEN SHOOT APPEARS and a leaf unfurls.

As Paddington watches, MORE AND MORE SHOOTS APPEAR, growing
upwards through the cracks in the floor.

CREEPERS WRAP THEMSELVES AROUND the iron bars of the CELL
DOOR which thicken and BECOME TREES.

Paddington stands up. And around him, instead of the cell, is
the majesty of the PERUVIAN RAINFOREST.

He hears a familiar sound.

He looks up and suddenly Aunt Lucy is there before him.

PADDINGTON
Aunt Lucy!

He races through the jungle and flies into her arms.

AUNT LUCY
What are you doing here? I thought
you'd be at home.

PADDINGTON
I'm afraid I haven’t got one any
more. You see, I’m in prison. And
even the Browns have forgotten me.

The jungle behind him disappears and he is back in prison.
And he hears a now familiar knock at the pipes.

KNUCKLES (0.S.)
Paddington!

Paddington goes and opens the vent on the pipe.

PADDINGTON
Knuckles?

KNUCKLES
Tonight’s the night, kid. We leave
at midnight. You want to clear your
name, it’s now or never. You in?

Paddington swallows, and then replies, reluctantly.

PADDINGTON
I’m in.

INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT
The clock strikes twelve. The WARDEN stands up to leave.

WARDEN
(to himself)
Right. Time to call it a night.
Nothing much going on round here,
anyway. They’ve been as good as
gold recently.

He switches out the light in the room.

But the camera pushes into the Warden’s MODEL OF THE MAIN
PRISON BUILDING and the FRONT SWINGS OPEN LIKE A DOLLS HOUSE,
showing a CROSS-SECTION OF THE PRISON.

The PRISONERS are all in their cells while GUARDS patrol the
staircases and corridors.

A SEARCHLIGHT sweeps across the entire prison complex from
the WATCH TOWER above a clock on top of the CENTRAL HALL.

In FOUR CELLS on the top floor, KNUCKLES, PHIBS, SPOON and
PADDINGTON get out of bed, and DROP THROUGH THE FLOORBOARDS.
INT. CRAWL SPACE BENEATH FLOOR - NIGHT

The camera drops down through the floor with them and tracks
along the prisoners as they crawl to the end of the building.

Knuckles unscrews a panel, and drops down the LAUNDRY CHUTE.

INT. PRISON LAUNDRY - NIGHT

The prisoners drop one by one onto a PILE OF LAUNDRY and run
out through a door.

INT. BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

The prisoners run into a long room supported by pillars.
Running the entire length of one wall are PIGEON HOLES
containing parcels of the prisoners’ clothes.

They each grabs a parcel of clothes, then Paddington is led
by Knuckles to a hatch which leads into the CLOCK MECHANISM.
INT. CLOCK PENDULUM - NIGHT

Paddington shimmies up the pendulum and at the top squeezes
into the clockwork mechanism.

Like Charlie Chaplin in MODERN TIMES he rides the cogs up
until he is deposited on the floor of the Warden's office.

INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE

Paddington grabs a key and heads out of the office.

INT. CANTEEN - NIGHT

The Prisoners use the key Paddington took to let themselves
into the canteen.

They run through grabbing a PILE OF TABLECLOTHS on the way.

INT. PRISON KITCHEN - NIGHT

They shimmy up to the skylight above the kitchen, carrying
the tablecloths, laundry basket and now a PROPANE TANK.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 86.

135 EXT. PRISON ROOF - NIGHT
The prisoners wait for the searchlight to sweep past the
kitchen, then climb out of the skylight and run along the
roof to the shadows at the base of the watch tower.

136 EXT. PRISON WATCH TOWER - NIGHT

The light sweeps over them once more and the prisoners climb
to the roof above the watch tower guard.

They open the basket and pull out an ENORMOUS SHEET OF TABLE
CLOTHS that have been STITCHED TOGETHER.

137 INT. LAUNDRY BASKET - NIGHT
Phibs opens the valve of the propane tank.

Spoon ignites the flame.

138 INT. CELL - NIGHT
T-BONE looks out the window and double-takes.
Rising from the roof of the watch tower is a HOT AIR BALLOON.

The CANOPY is made of TABLECLOTHS, the BASKET is the laundry
basket, and it's fuelled by PROPANE.

And riding in it are Knuckles, Phibs, Spoon and Paddington.
T-BONE
Good luck, little bear.
139 EXT. PRISON EXERCISE YARD - NIGHT

THE BALLOON floats OVER THE PRISON WALL.

140 EXT. BALLOON BASKET - NIGHT

Three prisoners hurl their prison hats and jackets into the
sky, whooping with delight at their escape.

But Paddington looks out at the city he loves, worried about
the choice he has made, scared of being a fugitive.
141 EXT. LONDON DOCKLANDS - NIGHT

Knuckles and the others are wearing the civilian clothes they
took with them. Paddington is back in his hat and coat.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 87.

KNUCKLES
Bring her down, Spoon.
142 EXT. DERELICT FACTORY - NIGHT

The balloon comes to earth by a derelict factory on the river
in the east end of London.

The prisoners tumble out of the basket and run through the
factory to the wharf as the balloon deflates behind them.
143 EXT. DERELICT FACTORY / WHARF - NIGHT
The prisoners run up to the wharf where a SEAPLANE waits.
KNUCKLES
There she is, boys. Our ticket out
of here.
Paddington is startled by this statement.
PADDINGTON
What do you mean? Where are you
going?
The prisoners look guiltily to one another.

SPOON
May as well tell him, Knuckles.

PADDINGTON
Tell me what? Aren’t we going to
clear my name?

KNUCKLES
(sheepishly)
Sorry, kid, er... Change of plan.

Paddington can scarcely believe what he’s hearing.

PHIBS

We're leaving the country!
SPOON

And you're coming with us!
PADDINGTON

But you said... You lied to me!

Knuckles feels ashamed of the deception but genuinely
believes he’s done the right thing.

KNUCKLES
Hey now, it’s not like that. We
were doing you a favour.

KNUCKLES (CONT'D)
If we’d told you the truth you’d
never have come along - and it’s
better this way. We’1l make
marmalade together!

PADDINGTON
But I don’t want to, Knuckles. I
want to go clear my name and go
home. And you said you'd help! You
promised!

KNUCKLES
(hardening his heart)
Sorry, kid. No can do.
Hearing this, Paddington just turns and runs.

SPOON
Paddington!

KNUCKLES
Let him go. If he wants to get
himself arrested, it’s his choice.
EXT. STREET / ALLEY - NIGHT
Paddington walks down a main road, all alone in the world.
Behind him, a POLICE CAR turns on its siren and drives
towards him. Paddington ducks into an alley, screwing his

eyes shut and waiting for the inevitable.

But the Police Car passes by. Paddington heaves a sigh of
relief - and looks up to see a TELEPHONE BOX in the alley.

An idea occurs to him. He finds a single coin in his pocket,
the one Mrs Bird found in his ear at breakfast.

He goes in to the phone box, picks up the receiver and dials.

JONATHAN (0.S.)
Hello!

Paddington is delighted to hear his friend’s voice.

PADDINGTON
Hello, Jonathan! It’s Pad-

JUDY (0.S.)
You’ve reached the Brown residence!

Paddington’s heart sinks as he realises he’s not got through
to the Browns, merely their answer-phone.

JONATHAN (0.S.)
We're not in but leave a message!
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 89.

The answer-phone beeps.

PADDINGTON
Hello, it’s me, Paddington.

145 INT. BROWNS’ HALLWAY - NIGHT
Paddington’s voice echoes in the empty hallway.

PADDINGTON (V.O.)
I hope you don’t mind my calling. I
just wanted to let you know I've
broken out of prison and, well, I
suppose I’m on the run. I didn’t
really mean to but Knuckles said if
we broke out, he’d help clear my
name, and then I could come home.

146 INT. PHONE BOX - NIGHT
PADDINGTON
But he’s gone now and I’m on my
own.
The pips go.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
I don’t really know why I’m
calling. I suppose I just wanted to
say...
The line goes dead.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
...goodbye.

He hangs up, his heart ready to burst.

He picks up his case and walks away from the phone box.

But then, behind him, the TELEPHONE RINGS.

Scarcely daring to believe, he turns and races to the phone.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Hello?

MARY (0.S.)
Paddington?

Relief floods through Paddington.

PADDINGTON
Yes! Yes, it’s Paddington!

147 INT. BROWNS’ HOUSE / PHONE BOX - NIGHT

Mary beckons Henry - who is just coming in from postering -
to join her and the rest of the family at the phone.

PADDINGTON
I’m so sorry I escaped, Mrs Brown
but I thought you’d forgotten me.

MRS BIRD
We'd never forget you, Paddington!

HENRY
Paddington?!

MARY
You're family!

JUDY
And we know who the thief was!

JONATHAN
Phoenix Buchanan!

PADDINGTON
Mr Buchanan?!

MRS BIRD
But he’s disappeared into thin air.

Mary looks at the piece of paper she took from his house.

MARY
We've been looking for him at every
landmark in that book, every last

page.

PADDINGTON
‘Where all your dreams come true’.

MARY
Why do you say that?

PADDINGTON
It was written on the last page of
the pop-up book. Always made me
think of Aunt Lucy.

MARY
That’s funny. I found the exact
same phrase on a piece of paper at
Phoenix’s house.

JUDY
I’m sure I’ve seen that before.

Judy looks at the cover of an old copy of her newspaper. It
has the picture of Phoenix and Paddington opening the fair.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 91.

On the organ behind them is the FAIRGROUND ORGAN, and on
that, the words ‘Where All Your Dreams Come True!’

HENRY
The Organ!

JONATHAN
That must be where Madame Kozlova
hid her fortune.

HENRY
Then let’s get to the fair!

JUDY
Too late. They’re leaving today.

JUDY (CONT'D)
From Paddington Station.

MARY
(looking at her paper)
At 6.35.
MRS BIRD

There’s still time.

HENRY
Paddington, get to the station. If
we can find Phoenix and get hold of
that book, his fingerprints will
prove everything.

148 INT. PHONE BOX - NIGHT
PADDINGTON
But that’s miles away, Mr Brown,

I’ll never...

Paddington hears the DISTINCTIVE HORN OF THE BIN LORRY and
looks down the alley to see MR BARNES, the BINMAN.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
I’ll see you there.
149 EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT
Paddington rides the dustbin lorry as it drives through town.
Cars screech to a halt around them.

emergency!

150 EXT. WINDSOR GARDENS - NIGHT

Mr Curry is standing by the newspaper kiosk his dressing gown
with a loud hailer. A homemade neighborhood ‘Panic board’
sits in the road next to him.

MR CURRY
Fellow citizens. This is your
Community Defence Force Commander.

The neighbours come to their windows, woken by the sound.

MR CURRY (CONT’D)
I have just received intelligence
the bear has escaped from prison
and may be heading this way. I am
raising the neighborhood panic
level to “Wild Hysteria”.

He shifts the arrow on his board from “Extremely Jittery” to
“Wild Hysteria”.

The Browns run out of their house towards their car.

MARY
Get out of the way, Mr Curry.

JUDY
Paddington’s not heading this way.

JONATHAN
He’s going to clear his name.

MRS BIRD
And we're going to bring him home!

MR CURRY
We don’t want him here!

Henry stops and approaches him. And as he speaks, the
neighbours begin to understand the truth of his words.

HENRY
Of course you don’t! You never
have. You took one look at that
bear and you made up your mind.
Well Paddington’s not like that. He
looks for the good in all of us and
somehow, he finds it. He wouldn’t
hesitate if any of us needed help.
So stand aside, Mr Curry, because
we're coming through!

Henry tries to start the car. But it stalls.
MR CURRY

Oh very good! Your plan seems to
have stalled. Like your vehicle.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 93.

But suddenly the car begins to move. Henry looks around,
amazed, to see the neighbours have gathered around their car
and are pushing it.

DR JAFRI
Second gear, clutch down, Mr Brown.

COLONEL
After three? Three!

MR CURRY
What’s going on? What are you
doing? Do not push that vehicle!

DR JAFRI
Bring Paddington home.

The car roars into life and heads toward the newspaper kiosk.
Mr Curry jumps out of the way as the car runs over the Panic
Board. The neighbours all cheer in relief.

151 EXT. PADDINGTON STATION / ENTRANCE RAMP - NIGHT
The dustbin lorry pulls up at the station.

The Bin Man jumps down, takes the PLASTIC SLEEVE off a LITTER
BIN by the entrance, and puts it over Paddington.

MR BARNES
Now Paddington, keep your head down
and remember, you’re a bin.
152 INT. PADDINGTON STATION / CONCOURSE - NIGHT
The bin walks across the concourse, muttering to itself.
PADDINGTON (0.S.)
You're a bin, you’re a bin, just an

ordinary bin, going for a walk.

He suddenly freezes as he sees a DOZY POLICEMAN approach,
eating a doughnut.

He ducks as the Policeman puts half a doughnut in the bin.

PADDINGTON (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Thank you!

The Policeman freezes. That was weird.
PADDINGTON (0.S.) (CONT'D)

Nothing to see here, Officer, just
a bin.

It’s quite good being a bin.
153 EXT. ROAD BRIDGE NEAR PADDINGTON STATION - NIGHT
The Browns’ car races over a bridge near Paddington. Beyond
the station are the first gleams of the winter dawn.
154 INT. PADDINGTON STATION / PLATFORM 1 - NIGHT
Paddington waits in the bin by the Fair Train, watching a
TRAIN PORTER APPROACH. It’s PHOENIX IN DISGUISE.
155 EXT. PADDINGTON STATION / ENTRANCE - NIGHT

The Browns pull up at the station and leap out of the car.

156 INT. PADDINGTON STATION / PLATFORM 1 - NIGHT
A whistle is blown and the train starts to move. Phoenix hops
onto the platform at the back of the FAIRGROUND ORGAN TRUCK
in the MIDDLE OF THE TRAIN.

Paddington casts off the bin, and leaps onto the platform at
the front of the REAR TRUCK as the train picks up speed.

The Browns run onto the platform as the train pulls away.

HENRY
Paddington!

They run faster, drawing near the moving train. Paddington leans
out from the rear truck and calls to them.

PADDINGTON
Mr Brown! Quickly! He’s on board!

Henry reaches out, almost touching the last truck.
But the train pulls away from them - and it’s gone.

PADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Don’t worry, I’1l handle it myself.

The Browns stand at the end of the platform, bereft.
MARY

We've got to catch up with that
train.

157 INT. PULLMAN CARRIAGE - NIGHT

The JUDGE and his WIFE are sitting in a smart carriage. A
STEWARD comes and offers them champagne.

WIFE
Oh how lovely! Thank you very much.

JUDGE
Very civilised. Nice to have a

The Judge's Wife starts shushing him.

Spoon pilots the plane high over the English countryside
while Knuckles tunes a portable radio.

vanished without a trace...

The three prisoners are delighted: they’ve got clean away.

seen boarding a train bound for
Bristol. Police are closing in and
expect to make an arrest soon.

The prisoners are visibly deflated by the news. Phibs looks
out of the window at the railway line far below.

Probably scared half to death.

The Fair Train races away from London and into rural England.
The camera pushes in towards the front truck which contains
the Fairground Organ.

INT. FAIR TRAIN / ORGAN TRUCK - DAY

Phoenix walks into the ORGAN TRUCK, taking off the wig he
wore to disguise himself as the Porter.

He pulls a TARPAULIN off the FAIRGROUND ORGAN. He looks at
one of the mannequin figures on the organ: the magician.

PHOENIX
Well, Grandfather, the moment of
truth.

He takes the pop-up book from his bag and turns to the first
page, Tower Bridge.

He presses the corresponding note on the ORGAN KEYBOARD. A
light appears.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)
It’s working.

He starts putting in the other notes, but at the far end of
the carriage, Paddington is watching through the window.

He spots the book, a HATCH in the roof above it, and
remembers Henry’s words.

HENRY (V.O.)
If we can find that book, his
fingerprints will prove everything.

Paddington looks around and spots a BARREL OF TOFFEE APPLES.
A plan begins to formulate in his mind.

Henry, Judy and Mrs Bird climb out onto the FRONT OF THE
ENGINE. Henry helps Mrs Bird and Judy onto the FAIR TRAIN.

Lastly, he reaches out with one leg and gets ONE FOOT on the
PLATFORM at the back of the FAIR TRAIN.

But suddenly the TRACKS PART and Henry finds his LEGS BEING
PULLED WIDE APART between the two trains.

CHAKRABATICS INSTRUCTOR (0.S.)
Open your mind and your legs will

Henry goes into a zen state and manages to do the splits.

But then, suddenly, he spots a telegraph pole rushing towards
him and screams for help.

Luckily, Mrs Bird hears him, runs back to the platform and
pulls him to safety.

HENRY
Thank heavens for Chakrabatics.

INT. FAIR TRAIN / ORGAN TRUCK - DAY

PHOENIX is putting in the last of the code. Above him,
Paddington opens the HATCH and looks down.

PHOENIX
“E". And "E."

Suddenly the WHOLE FAIRGROUND ORGAN LIGHTS UP. Phoenix steps
forward, hypnotised by the splendour of what he’s seeing.

Behind him, Paddington SWINGS THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT, using the
toffee apples like suckers to HANG FROM THE ROOF.

With a whirring of cogs, the ORGAN BEGINS TO OPEN. The pipes
sink down, and the mannequin of Madame Koslova rises into the
body of the machine, exposing a complex CLOCKWORK MECHANISM.

Behind Phoenix, Paddington creeps along towards the book, the
sound of the toffee apples masked by the sound of the organ.

Meanwhile, a TREASURE BOX rises out of the organ mechanism.
Phoenix stares, entranced, as the box opens, revealing its
treasure: piles of gold jewellery, trinkets and diamonds.

PHOENIX (CONT'D)

Aren’t you pretty! West End, here I
come!

Suddenly the organ stops playing and now Phoenix can hear the
sound of the toffee apples on the roof behind him.

He turns round to see Paddington, upside down, nose to nose
with him.

PADDINGTON
Morning, Mr Buchanan.

Phoenix steps back, astounded and accidentally KICKS THE
ORGAN KEYBOARD.

The TREASURE BOX slams shut and the pipes descend, hiding the
treasure.

Phoenix tries to put the code back in as Paddington scrambles
out onto the roof with the book.

Phoenix climbs onto the roof and chases the bear.
PHOENIX
Where do you think you’re going,
bear? It’s a train! It comes to an
end, like all of us alas.

Paddington looks round to see that he has, indeed, reached
the back of the train.

He skids to a halt, only just avoiding falling off the train.

I'll tell you exactly what I'm
going to do. I’m going to bloomin’
well biff you on the nose.

Phoenix grabs a SWORD-SWALLOWER’S SWORD from the wall and
brandishes it professionally.

PHOENIX
Not a very good idea. Stage combat
level four.

Mrs Bird grabs a gun from a rack at his end of the carriage.

MRS BIRD
Well where I come from, laddie,
they teach you never to bring a
knife to a gunfight.

PHOENIX
I think you’ll find that fires
plastic darts.

Mrs Bird fires a gun - and the dart sticks onto Phoenix’s
forehead. He pulls it off with a pop.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 102.

So it does.

PHOENIX
Whereas this sword is razor sharp.

He slices his sword through some stuffed animals. The Browns
jump, terrified. He starts walking them back into the next
carriage, grabbing some handcuffs on his way.
PHOENIX (CONT'D)

Afternoon, Your Honour. The hair’s
looking lovely.
It’s all too much for the Judge, who passes out into his
pudding.
172 EXT. FAIR TRAIN / REAR TRUCK - DAY

Paddington is suddenly amazed to spot MRS BROWN in the
driver’s cab at the other end of the train.

PADDINGTON

Paddington opens his suitcase and pulls out his TELESCOPIC
LADDER.

He wedges the top end of the ladder into a gap in the
floorboards of the platform at the back of the train.

Paddington climbs onto the bottom end of the ladder and
starts WINDING IT OUT towards the PULLMAN, hoping to create a

bridge between the two trains.
Suddenly, Phoenix appears at the door and spots Paddington.

He tries to go through the door - but it’s locked. He throws
a shoulder against it.

Phoenix is still bashing against the door. The wood starts to
splinter.

Meanwhile, Paddington has made his way to the far end of the

Bye bye, bear.

He leans out and uses the pin to knock a TRACK-SIDE LEVER.

The POINTS SHIFT, sending Paddington’s truck hurtling onto a
different track.

Phoenix turns back inside but stops in his tracks, standing
in the middle of four COCONUTS ON STANDS.

We crash zoom as he sees the Browns have escaped from their
handcuffs and stand at the far end of the next truck.

Judy takes a photograph, while Henry picks up a coconut shy
ball, and throws it.

It travels through clean the two trucks and connects with
PHOENIX’S FOREHEAD - knocking him cold.

HENRY
Bullseye!
EXT. RAILWAY - DAY

PADDINGTON’S TRUCK has left the main railway line and is now
hurtling through a siding.

He is thrown around as it CRASHES THROUGH THE BUFFERS at the
end of the siding.

It HURTLES DOWN A SLOPE, crashing through foliage, over a
cliff and into the murky waters of a river below.

 

INT. PULLMAN DRIVER’S CAB - DAY
Mary has seen the disaster from their cab.

MARY
Stop the train, Jonathan.

Jonathan PULLS THE BRAKE LEVER.

EXT. VIADUCT - DAY

The Pullman SHRIEKS TO A HALT on a viaduct.

181 INT. RUNAWAY FAIR TRUCK - DAY
Paddington’s truck is SINKING INTO THE RIVER.

He tries to open the door - but it won't give.

182 EXT. VIADUCT - DAY

Mary jumps off the train.

MARY
Jonathan. Go and get help.

183 INT. RUNAWAY FAIR TRUCK - DAY

Paddington heaves, but the door still won’t give, and the

carriage is filling with water.
184 EXT. VIADUCT - DAY

Mary runs to the side of the bridge.

185 EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

The Runaway Truck lands at the bottom of the river.

186 EXT. VIADUCT - DAY

Mary pulls off her coat and DIVES INTO THE WATER.

187 EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

Mary cuts through the water, swimming down towards the truck.

188 INT. RUNAWAY FAIR TRUCK - DAY

A FEW INCHES OF AIR have been trapped towards the top of the
truck, but they’re DISAPPEARING FAST.

Paddington hears a METALLIC NOISE from the other side of the
door as Mary works the lock from the outside.

He TAKES A FINAL BREATH and sinks under the water.

189 EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
Mary has UNBOLTED THE DOOR. She HEAVES IT OPEN, inch by inch.

She can see Paddington’s face through the crack in the door.

But then the door STOPS MOVING.
Mary looks frantically around for the problem.
She sees that the door has been CHAINED SHUT.

Mary and Paddington TUG AT THE CHAIN TOGETHER with all their
might - but it's no good.

The chain is just too strong.

Paddington reaches through the gap in the doorway and TAKES
MARY'S HAND WITH HIS PAW.

They gaze at each other, knowing the end is upon him.
But suddenly... a shadow crosses his eyes.

He looks up to see the silhouette of a SEAPLANE LANDING ON
THE WATER ABOVE THEM!

He can hear distant voices.

There are three splashes as people dive in.

And then... SOMEONE ELSE IS AT THE DOOR!

It’s KNUCKLES! Phibs and Spoon follow in his wake.
Together, they ALL PULL AT THE DOORS.

And slowly, inexorably, the CHAIN BREAKS.

Mary grabs Paddington and pulls him towards the surface.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY
Mary, Knuckles and Paddington surface, gasping for breath.

PADDINGTON
Knuckles! You came back!

KNUCKLES
Can’t make marmalade on my own,
now, can I?

Paddington smiles - and then passes out.

MARY
Paddington? He’s burning up.

KNUCKLES
Best get the little fella to bed.

They climb out of the water as Henry, Jonathan, Judy and Mrs
Bird appear on the bank.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 107.
HENRY
Mary!

JUDY
Mum!

JOANTHAN
Paddington!

MARY
He’s not well.

KNUCKLES
He'll be fine. Won’t you, little
buddy.
191 EXT. WINDSOR GARDENS - THREE DAYS LATER
Snow falls in the street. The camera cranes up towards
Paddington’s attic window and through into his room.
192 INT. PADDINGTON'S ATTIC ROOM - DAY

Paddington lies asleep in bed, surrounded by the family. Mrs
Bird is taking his temperature.

As she removes the thermometer from his mouth, his eyelids
flutter and he wakes up.

JONATHAN
Paddington!
PADDINGTON
Where am I?
MARY
Take it easy, now.
MRS BIRD
You gave us a wee scare, but you’re

home now.
Paddington’s face lights up.

PADDINGTON
Home?

JUDY
That's right. Look!

Judy hands him a newspaper: “EXCLUSIVE! PADDINGTON FREED! Dog
Food Actor Arrested.”

JONATHAN
The police realised they’d made a
terrible mistake.

HENRY
Phoenix Buchanan has been arrested
and, I might add, is no longer a
member of our Platinum Club.

MRS BIRD

You're a free bear.
PADDINGTON

How long have I been asleep?!
JONATHAN

Three days!
PADDINGTON

Three days? But that means...

JUDY
It’s Aunt Lucy’s birthday.

A little spark goes out in Paddington’s eyes.

PADDINGTON
Oh. And I never sent anything.

MARY
It’s alright, Paddington.

PADDINGTON

But it isn’t alright Mrs Brown.
Aunt Lucy did so much for me when I
was a cub - and all I ever really
wanted to do was to make her proud.
But now she’s going to wake up on
her birthday with no present and
think I’ve let her down completely.

MRS BIRD
Och you great goose, she won’t
think that at all!

PADDINGTON
Won’t she?

HENRY
Come with us.

He takes Paddington by the paw and leads him downstairs.

INT. THE BROWNS’ STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

Paddington looks over the banisters to see the hallway is
full of people. It seems like the whole neighbourhood has
come to wish him well.

MR GRUBER
He’s here!
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 109.

The neighbours erupt into cheers and applause.

PADDINGTON

What are you all doing here?
MISS KITTS

We wanted to say thank you.
PADDINGTON

Thank you?
MS PETERS

For everything you’ve done for us.
PADDINGTON

Me?

The crowd agree.

COLONEL

If it wasn’t for you, we'd never

have met.
BIN MAN

You helped me pass my exams.

DR JAFRI
And I would be permanently locked
out of my house.

The crowd laugh - but all Paddington can think is how amazed
he is that he means so much to them.

HENRY
I’d say you’ve rather a lot to be
proud of.

MR GRUBER

When we heard the police needed the
book as evidence we thought we’d
get Aunt Lucy another present.

DR JAFRI
We all clubbed together.

COLONEL
I pulled in a few favours from my
old air force buddies.

CYCLIST
And we think she’s going to love
it.
Paddington looks baffled.

PADDINGTON
But... what is it?
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 110.

MARY
You wanted to get that book so Aunt
Lucy could see London, didn’t you?

PADDINGTON
It was always her dream.

MARY
Well we thought, why look at London
in a book, when she could see the
real thing?

Just then, the DOORBELL RINGS. Paddington looks up at Mary,
not daring to believe.

MARY (CONT'D)
Why don't you go and answer it?

Paddington goes to the front door and opens it.
And there, standing in the snow, is Aunt Lucy.
The Young Bear’s face lights up in perfect joy.
He flies into her arms and nuzzles against her.

AUNT LUCY
Oh, Paddington.

PADDINGTON
Happy birthday, Aunt Lucy.

In Paddington’s eyes, we see his happiness is complete.

THE END.

CREDITS.

As the credits roll, PADDINGTON’S SCRAP BOOK appears on
screen. As the PAGES TURN, we discover what happened next.

- Paddington and Aunt Lucy toured London, their journey
commemorated with snapshots and ticket stubs: Mammal Mia,
Bearfoot in the Park, The Winter’s Tail.

- Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon were paroled. The Portobello
Express notes that the Judge described them as changed men.
They plan to open a cafe called “Knuckles’ Sandwiches”.

- Mary swam the channel. But she forgot her passport and had
to swim back again.

- Jonathan gave up the name J-Dog and started the Steam Team,
which proved surprisingly popular among his classmates.

- Henry finally got his promotion, having proved that he was
not too old for anything.

- A final newspaper headline in the scrapbook announces
‘PHOENIX BUCHANAN SENTENCED TODAY.’ Under the headline is a
picture of the JUDGE, which comes to life...

JUDGE
Phoenix Buchanan you have proved
yourself a heinous criminal.

Phoenix whimpers.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
And a disgrace to the noble
profession of acting.

Phoenix howls with self pity.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
I hereby sentence you to ten years
in prison - and suggest you use
your time behind bars wisely.

As Phoenix listens to these words, a change comes over him.

PHOENIX
I shall your honour. I shall.

EXT. PRISON - DAY

A caption reads SIX MONTHS LATER.
Post Additional Photography Draft 2 - 06.08.17 112.

196 INT. PRISON ATRIUM - DAY

Phoenix is in prison, performing an EXTRAVAGANT MUSICAL
version of “RAIN ON THE ROOF”. But instead of performing on
his own, he now is part of a company with the other inmates.

They finish the routine and the prison crowd go wild.

PHOENIX
Thank you my darlings, thank you.
It seems I didn’t need the West End
at all, just a captive audience.

The crowd laugh at his terrible joke.
PHOENIX (CONT'D)

Honestly, what am I like? Guards,
lock me up! Oh wait, you have!
