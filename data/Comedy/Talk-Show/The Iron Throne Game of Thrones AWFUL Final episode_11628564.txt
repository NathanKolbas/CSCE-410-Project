GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 1.

EXT. KING'S LANDING MAIN GATES - DAY

Snow has begun to fall and will continue to fall throughout
this day.

King's Landing is a smoldering wreck of a city.

TYRION LANNISTER steels himself and heads inside the ruined
capital. We follow him Son of Saul style, tight on his face
as he passes through the gates. Where the main gate once
stood there is only melted steel and crumbled stone.

There is no score to soften the horror. Aside from a few
distant shouts and screams, the broken city is eerily quiet.

Much of the victorious army is behind him, but we’ll only see
them incidentally as he passes through the gates with a small
honor guard. Smoke, shallow focus.

JON SNOW and DAVOS SEAWORTH follow him with a small group of
NORTHMEN at their backs, but we stay with Tyrion’s
perspective for the whole of this opening sequence: on his
back, on his face.

On the periphery of the frame, scorched bodies lie on the
sides of the main street where they fell. Tyrion sees them
(and Jon and Davos behind him), but they keep walking.

People baked in their brick home as if in an oven. And a
child sitting out front, crying, alone.

Another dead child, face down on the ground.

A NORTHERN SOLDIER sits on a pile of rubble in front of a
stairwell, weeping amongst the wreckage.

Human silhouettes on the dragon-scorched ground where the
ashes have blown away, the negative image of the Hiroshima
silhouettes.

A WALKING WOUNDED MAN passes without acknowledging Tyrion and
his party. As if he does not even see them.

A small, charred hand pokes out from underneath the rubble,
holding a tin horse. The same little girl Arya tried to help
in 805.

They all stop to look at what remains of the dead little
girl.

Tyrion glances at Jon.

TYRION
I'll find you later.
JON
Let me send some of my men with

you.

(CONTINUED )

CONTINUED:

Jon gestures to his men to go with Tyrion, but:

TYRION
I’m going alone.

Tyrion stares at Jon for a beat. He outranks everyone here.
Jon finally nods and steps aside.

Jon watches him walk through an archway framing the
devastation beyond. We tilt up to reveal the distant Red
Keep.

EXT. KING'S LANDING ALLEY - DAY

Jon, Davos and the Northmen come across GREY WORM and a
platoon of Unsullied standing over a group of LANNISTER
OFFICERS on their knees.

GREY WORM
In the name of the one true queen,
Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you
to die.

JON
Grey Worm!

Grey Worm turns and watches Jon approach. He seems neither
surprised nor pleased to see his queen’s lover.

JON
It’s over. These men are prisoners.

GREY WORM
It is not over until the queen’s
enemies are defeated.

DAVOS
(incredulous)
How much more defeated do you want
them to be? They’re on their knees!

GREY WORM
They are breathing.
DAVOS
Look around you, friend. We won.
GREY WORM
I follow my queen’s commands. Not
yours.
JON
And what are the queen’s commands?
GREY WORM
“Kill all those who follow Cersei

Lannister.”

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 3.
CONTINUED:

Grey Worm draws his knife.
GREY WORM
These are free men. They chose to
fight for her.

As Grey Worm steps behind the first officer in the line, Jon
grabs his arm.

A dozen Unsullied level their spears at Jon.

The Northmen behind Jon draw their swords, prepared to defend
their commander.

DAVOS
Easy, men! Easy!

Grey Worm pulls his arm free and stares at Jon. He is quite
ready to fight the Northerner if further provoked.

Jon stares back, but unlike Grey Worm he is plagued with
doubt. These men are his allies. How did it come to this?

DAVOS
(to Jon)
We should speak to the Queen.

Jon hates to walk away from what he considers an injustice,
but the only other choice is even greater bloodshed.

He walks away, turning once to see Grey Worm cut the first
officer’s throat.

INT. MAP ROOM - DAY

Tyrion walks past the ruined map room, snow starting to cover
the ash and rubble.

INT. SMALL COUNCIL ROOM - DAY

He walks past the table where he and Cersei often fought,
past the little office where he and his father often fought.

He grabs an unlit torch from a sconce. He's heading into the
darkness.
INT. TUNNELS- DAY

Alone and carrying a lit torch, Tyrion makes his way down a
staircase into the secret underbelly of the Red Keep.

At the end of the dark tunnel he comes upon a great mound of
rubble, blocking his passage. He raises his torch and sees a
small gap at the very top of the rubble. It is lighter on the
other side than it is here.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 4.
CONTINUED:

He puts down the torch and starts climbing up the rubble.

INT. DRAGON SKULL ROOM - DAY

Tyrion walks through what's left of the dragon skull room,
toward the light provided by the hole that Drogon blasted in
the ceiling.

Many of the skulls have been crushed by falling rock; even
Balerion the Dread's skull has been caved in. All of the
skulls have been blackened and scorched by the extreme heat
of the fires that raged for hours.

And then he sees it, in the pile of rubble and ash made by
Drogon’s blast:

A hint of a golden hand.

Tyrion gets down on his knees and clears the rubble and ash
away.

It's hard, filthy work. Tyrion starts to cry midway through
but doesn’t stop until he’s cleared away the remains of Jaime
and Cersei.

They are still in each other's arms: his golden hand resting
beside her head; her lion pendant still encircling her neck.

Tyrion sits beside the remains of his brother and sister and
cries for them both.

EXT. RED KEEP FRONT GATES (AEGON'S HILL) - DAY

High atop Aegon's Hill, we follow ARYA STARK as she heads
toward the plaza. She passes a group of Unsullied as they
toss dead Lannister bodies in a pile, stacking them like
cordwood.

Reaching the edge of the plaza, she stays on the edge of the
proceedings, observing from a distance.

Targaryen imagery is on display here: the big red and black
dragon banners have been draped over the walls.

Unsullied line both sides of the steps, with Grey Worm
waiting up top. All the remaining Unsullied are in formation
in front of the steps.

Behind them, the Dothraki congregate, some with their horses,
some on foot.

And behind the Dothraki, at the main entrance to the plaza,
opposite the steps, Jon enters into the space. Arya sees him.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 5.
CONTINUED:

We go to Jon as he looks across the crowd to the staircase
and the wrecked facade that frames the top of it. The wrecked
Red Keep visible in the distance.

We follow Jon as he makes his way through the Dothraki, then
to the aisle in the Unsullied ranks that leads to the
staircase.

Jon sees Grey Worm standing at the top of the steps, staring
down at him.

They both look up when they hear the heavy beat of dragon
wings.

Drogon flies overhead, over Dothraki waving their arakhs and
Unsullied standing motionless, spears in hand.

Drogon lands out of sight beyond the top of the stairs. Jon
climbs the stairway. When he nears the top he sees Dany,
already dismounted, walking towards him. For a moment,
Drogon’s unfolding wings spread behind her back, an
unsettling image. Her Satanic Majesty’s Request.

She walks to the edge of the steps and looks out over her
gathered armies, over the demolished city.

First she addresses her Dothraki in their native tongue.

DANY
Qoy goyi! Shafka vernish ei asqoy
shafki anhaan. Shafka addrivish
dozge anni ma khogaroon shigethi
mori!
(Blood of my blood! You kept all
your promises to me. You killed my
enemies in their iron suits!)

The Dothraki scream and raise their arakhs into the air. We
have some badass-looking Dothraki in the mix.

DANY
Shafka ohharish okrenegwin mori!
(You tore down their stone houses!)

Her khalasar roars.

DANY
Shafka ray azhish anhaan Rhaeshis
Andahli!
(You have given me the Seven
Kingdoms! )

Her Dothraki scream and wave their arakhs.
Jon watches all this, disturbed.
Next Dany addresses her Unsullied in Valyrian, first turning

to Grey Worm.

(Torgo Nudho, you have walked
beside me since the Plaza of Pride.
You are the bravest of men, the
most loyal of soldiers. I name you
commander of all my forces, the
Queen’s Master of War.)

Grey Worm bows his head, acknowledging this high honor.

Tyrion approaches from the Red Keep side, looking shaken and
despondent. Jon glances at him.

Tyrion doesn’t look at Jon, or at Dany’s gathered forces. He
is trapped inside his own head, thinking about what he just
saw.

Dany turns to the Unsullied foot soldiers standing down in
the plaza.

DANY
Dovaogedys! Jeme hen mufioti fioghoti

(Unsullied! All of you were torn
from your mothers’ arms and raised
as slaves. Now you are liberators!
You have freed the people of King’s
Landing from the grip of a tyrant!)

The Unsullied slam their spear butts onto the ground, three
times in perfect synch, affirming their pride in their
achievement and their queen.

DANY

the world!

DANY (CONT'D)

From Winterfell to Dorne, from

Lannisport to Qarth, from the

Summer Isles to the Jade Sea,

women, men, and children have

suffered too long beneath the

wheel. Will you break the wheel

with me?)

The Unsullied slam their spear butts onto the ground, again
and again, eager for the fight.

Tyrion, who understands enough Valyrian to get the gist of
what she's saying, looks around the ruined city. If this is
liberation, he doesn't believe in liberation theology.

The Unsullied continue to drum the butts of their spears on
the ground in unison, praising their queen.

Amidst the ashes of her conquest and the corpses of her
enemies, Dany accepts the worship of her followers. The
devastated city stretches out below her, but she shows no
signs of ambivalence or doubt. She has burned the village to
save it.

Arya watches from afar, cool and hooded, appraising Dany and
her forces. Arya hated Cersei as much as anyone. That doesn’t
mean she likes the new boss. To her it looks like the Seven
Kingdoms just traded one tyrant for another.

Dany turns to Tyrion.
We begin to fade down on the drumming spears.

DANY
You freed your brother. You
committed treason.

Tyrion sees no point in arguing his case. He looks around the
ruined city.

He begged her not to do this, and she did it anyway. Hundreds
of thousands have died.

He wanted a bloodless revolution. He would have gladly died
to put her on the throne without the horror they just
witnessed. But he failed.

TYRION
I freed my brother. And you
slaughtered a city.

He steps forward to the edge of the landing, removes his Hand
pin and tosses it down the steps.

The spear butting stops abruptly. Thousands of Dany’s loyal

warriors stare up at this man who dares to disrespect their
queen.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 8.

At one point, this betrayal would have hurt Dany deeply. That
point is long gone. She stares at her former Hand with anger,
disgusted that she trusted him so deeply for so long.

DANY
Ziry najikatas.
(Take him.)

Grey Worm and a posse of Unsullied follow out the order as
Jon watches in disbelief.

Dany walks toward the Red Keep, flanked by a large contingent
of her Dothraki bodyguards.

Jon is so distracted by what he’s just seen that he doesn’t
notice Arya now standing beside him.

Jon looks at her in disbelief.

JON
What are you doing here?

ARYA
I came to kill Cersei. Your queen
got there first.

JON
She’s everyone’s queen, now.

Arya’s expression is noncommittal.

ARYA
Try telling Sansa.

Jon needs to go deal with matters, now.

JON
Wait for me outside the city. I'll
find you.

Before he can take a step, Arya grabs his arm and looks up at
him.

ARYA
Jon.

No one else is close enough to hear their words.
ARYA
She knows who you are. Who you
really are. You'll always be a
threat to her.
Arya looks to Dany, walking away with her Dothraki bodyguard.

ARYA
And I know a killer when I see one.

INT. MAKESHIFT CELL - DAY

The Unsullied have found a makeshift cell for Tyrion
somewhere on the Red Keep grounds. Perhaps it's one of the
few intact chambers.

Tyrion sits with his back against the wall, staring up at the
weak light.

We hear the bolt slide and the door opens: Jon Snow stands
there. He nods to the Unsullied sentries and steps inside.

One of the sentries closes the door after him and we hear the
bolt slide.

TYRION
Did you bring any wine?
JON
No.
TYRION
(disappointed)
Ah. Well, thank you for coming to
see me.
(beat)
Our queen doesn’t keep prisoners
for long.
JON
No.
TYRION

I suppose there’s a crude kind of
justice. I betrayed my closest
friend and watched him burn. Now
Varys’ ashes can tell my ashes,
“See! I told you.”

Jon is unable to see the humor in the situation.

TYRION
It just occurred to me: I’m talking
to the only man alive who knows
where I’m going. So? Is there life
after death?

JON
Not that I’ve seen.

Tyrion takes this with his usual fatalism.

TYRION
I should be thankful. Oblivion is
the best I can hope for. I
strangled my lover. I shot my own
father with a crossbow. I betrayed
my queen.

JON
You didn’t--

TYRION
I did. And I'd do it again, now
that I’ve seen what I’ve seen.
(shrugs )
I chose my fate. The people of
King's Landing did not.

Jon cannot argue with this. He's seen too much horror in the
last day. He glances towards the window.

JON
I can’t justify what happened. I
won't try. But the war is over now.

TYRION
Is it? When you heard her talking
to her soldiers, did she sound like
someone who's done fighting?

Jon doesn’t answer, but his expression makes it clear he
harbors the same worry.

TYRION
She’s a conqueror. She liberated
the people of Slaver's Bay. She
liberated the people of King's
Landing. She'll go on liberating
until all the people of the world
are free... and she rules them all.

JON
And you've been by her side,
counseling her. Until today.

TYRION
Until today.
(beat)
Varys was right. I was wrong. It
was vanity to think I could guide
her. Our queen’s nature is fire and
blood.

JON

(angry)
You think our house words are
stamped on our bodies when we're
born and that’s who we are? Then
I'd be fire and blood, too.

(quieter)
She’s not her father. No more than
you're Tywin Lannister.

Tyrion considers this point.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 11.
CONTINUED: (2)

TYRION

My father was an evil man. My
sister was an evil woman. Pile up
all the bodies of all the people
they ever killed. Throw in Ramsay
Bolton's victims for good measure.
Add them all up, and they still
won't be half as many as our
beautiful queen slaughtered in a
single day. A million people lived
in this filthy city before we
attacked. How many are living now?

The argument gets more heated, both men impassioned.

JON
Cersei left her no choice--

TYRION
The moment the gates fell the
battle was over. She burned
families alive in their homes.

JON
She saw her best friend beheaded.
She saw her dragon shot out of the
sky. Your sister betrayed her.

TYRION
And she burnt down a city for it!

JON
It’s easy to judge when you're
standing far from the battlefield--

TYRION

Would you have done it?
JON

What?
TYRION

You've been up there, on a dragon’s
back. You’ve had that power. Would
you have burnt the city down?

JON
I don’t know.

TYRION
Yes, you do. You won’t say it
because you don’t want to betray
her. But you know.

JON

What does it matter, what I would
do?

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 12.
CONTINUED: (3)

TYRION
It matters more than anything.

Tyrion looks up at Jon. It’s important that Jon listens and
Tyrion makes sure he is before beginning his argument.

TYRION

When she murdered the slavers of
Astapor, I’m sure no one but the
slavers complained. After all, they
were evil men. When she crucified
hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who
could argue? They were evil men.
The Dothraki khals she burnt alive?
They would have done worse to her.
Everywhere she goes, evil men die
and we cheer her for it. And she
grows more powerful, and more sure
that she is Good and Right.

(beat)
She believes her destiny is to
build a better world, for everyone.
To fix what is broken for every
man, woman and child. If you
believed that, if you truly
believed it... wouldn’t you kill
whoever stands between you and
paradise?

The two men are silent for a moment.

TYRION

I know you love her. I love her,
too. Not as successfully as you.
But I believed in her with all my
heart.

(beat)
Love is more powerful than reason.
We all know that. Look at my
brother.

Jon remembers what Aemon told him so many years ago.

JON
“Love is the death of duty.”

The words surprise Tyrion.

TYRION
You just came up with that?

JON
Maester Aemon said it.

Tyrion nods, thinking about it.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 13.
CONTINUED: (4)

TYRION

Sometimes duty is the death of
love. “You are the shield that
guards the realm of men.” You’ve
always tried to do the right thing.
Always, no matter the cost, you’ve
tried to protect people. Who is the
greatest threat to the people now?

He lets Jon think about that for a moment.

Tyrion looks old and weary as he admits the great failure of
his life.

TYRION
You won't be able to hold her in
check. You won’t be able to guide
her. I thought I could. I thought
she'd listen to me. I was wrong.
(beat)
You’re the last hope.

Jon realizes that Tyrion is overtly asking him to turn on
Dany.

JON
I love her.

TYRION

I know.

(beat)
It’s a terrible thing I’m asking.
It’s also the right thing.

(beat)
You think I’m the last man she’1l
execute? If you don’t stop her,
everyone who stands against her
will share my fate. And who is more
dangerous than the rightful heir to
the Iron Throne?

Jon shakes his head. He’s long past caring about himself or
his personal safety.

JON
If that’s her decision... she’s the
queen.
He looks around the cell.

JON
I’m sorry it came to this.

He knocks on the door of the cell and waits for the Unsullied
to come get him.

TYRION
And your sisters?

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 14.
CONTINUED: (5)

Jon turns to look at Tyrion. He doesn’t care about his own
skin but his sisters -- that’s a very different matter.

TYRION
They're both as stubborn as their
mother ever was. Do you see them
bending the knee? Sansa swearing
eternal loyalty to a queen she
neither likes nor trusts?

Jon's response is neither convinced nor convincing:

JON
My sisters will be loyal to the
Throne.

We hear the footsteps of the Unsullied approaching the cell.

TYRION
Why do you think Sansa told me the
truth about you? Because she
doesn’t want Dany to be queen--

JON

She doesn’t get to choose!
TYRION

No. But you do.

(beat)
And you have to choose now.

We hear the bolt slide and the door opens.
Jon stares at Tyrion for a beat and walks out.

The door shuts. The bolt slides. And Tyrion waits.

EXT. RED KEEP - RUINS - DAY

Jon walks through the ruins of the Red Keep.

The approach to the throne room is lined with Unsullied,
dozens of them. None of them stop Jon. They all know who he
is, and what he means to their queen.

The red-and-black Targaryen banners hang at regular
intervals.

EXT. RED KEEP - OUTSIDE THE THRONE ROOM - DAY

Turning a corner, Jon arrives at the building that houses the
throne room.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 15.
CONTINUED:

Jon looks up at the wreckage, then down to the entryway; it
looks a bit like the frontage of a cathedral wrecked in the
Blitz, surrounded by monumental chunks of fire-blackened
masonry. But the doors are intact.

Jon steps forward, but stops.

Amidst the mountains of black rubble, Drogon lies next to the
entrance, cleaning his claws with his long tongue.

He’s been hidden in plain sight for much of this time, his
dusty black scales almost a part of the rubble.

Jon takes a deep breath and heads for the doors.
Drogon sees him. He lifts his head, blocking the way.

The massive dragon stares at the diminutive man, studying him
with eyes that seem just as intelligent as Jon's own.

For a long, tense beat, Drogon considers this suitor for his
mother's attentions.

His head comes in close. He takes a big sniff.

Jon is a friend, not a threat. Drogon’s head snakes away,
back to his claws to resume his cleaning.

Jon walks past the dragon and into the keep.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Dany stands in the Throne Room. It looks just like it did in
her vision, only the area behind the Iron Throne has been
destroyed altogether. I.e., no window behind throne,
Lannister or otherwise.

The snow falls lightly through the collapsed roof as she
steps past the pillars, down the central aisle. Rubble from
the fallen roof is visible on the floor, covered in a layer
of snow.

For a few seconds, the conquering queen disappears and she
looks like a young girl again, entranced by the beauty of the
moment, and the object of her greatest desire.

It is right there. The reason for her long journey across two
continents, the endless conflicts, the deaths of her loved
ones:

The Iron Throne.

She slowly climbs the snow-covered stairs.

She reaches out to touch it, and hesitates. Perhaps she

remembers the vision in which the throne was a temptation to
avoid.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 16.
CONTINUED:

But this isn’t a vision. This is real. She touches the arm of
the throne, resting her hand on the cold metal where so many
of her ancestors’ hands rested for so many centuries.

She is standing directly in front of it. All she has to do is
sit and the journey is complete.

She turns to sit. In doing so, she sees Jon enter the throne
room.

The throne can wait. She steps down to meet him on the floor
in front of the throne platform.

Dany is at ease for the first time in as long as we can
remember. Maybe the first time ever. She has won.

She looks back at the throne.

DANY
When I was a girl, my brother told
me it was made with a thousand
swords from Aegon’s fallen enemies.

She smiles at the memory as she turns back to Jon.

DANY

What do a thousand swords look like
in the mind of a little girl who
can’t count to twenty? I imagined a
mountain of swords too high to
climb. So many fallen enemies you
could only see the soles of Aegon’s
feet.

(beat)
But many years later, I saw it. The
real thing.

JON
How?

DANY
In a vision. The roof, the snow,
the throne...
(beat)
It all looked exactly like this.

In this room, at this very moment, the sense of Dany’s
destiny is pervasive. Shattering its spell is difficult. But
Jon does, because he has to.

JON
I saw them executing Lannister
prisoners in the street. They said
they were acting on your orders.

She can see that Jon is deeply troubled. She does not
condescend. On the contrary, she loves him for it.

DANY
It was necessary.

But Dany hasn’t seen the things Jon has seen, on the ground.

JON
Have you been down there? Have you
seen?

Dany has not. Thinking about it, Jon is shaken.

JON
Children. Little children, burned.

DANY
I tried to make peace with Cersei.
And she used their innocence as a
weapon against me. She thought it
would cripple me, leave me unable
to do what needed to be done.
(beat)
She left me no choice.

Jon takes this in.

JON
And Tyrion?

DANY
He conspired behind my back with my
enemies. How have you treated
people who’ve done the same to you?
Even when it broke your heart?

JON
Forgive him.

DANY
I can’t.

JON

You can. You can forgive all of
them. Make them see that they made
a mistake. Make them understand.

Looking at her, his need to believe is almost overwhelming.

JON
Please, Dany.

She considers his plea for clemency for a long moment. But
she cannot grant it.

DANY
We can’t hide behind small mercies.
The world we need won’t be built by
men loyal to the world we have.

JON
The world we need is a world of
mercy. It has to be.

She starts to close the gap between them.

DANY
It will be.

She takes his hands.

DANY
It’s not easy to see something
that’s never been before. A good
world.

JON
How do you know?
(off her questioning look)
That it will be good?

DANY
Because I know what is good. I know
what is right.
(beat)
And so do you.

Jon shakes his head. He’s near tears now, struggling to keep
it together.

JON
I don’t.

DANY
You do. You’ve always known.

He looks into the eyes of the woman he loves.

JON
What about everyone else? All the
other people who think they know
what’s good and right?

The fire of the conqueror flares in Dany’s eyes.

DANY
They don’t get to choose.

Jon understands what this means for the people he loves the
most.

She puts her hands on his face.

DANY
Be with me, build the new world
with me. This is our reason, it has
been from the beginning.

DANY (CONT'D)

Since you were a little boy with a

bastard’s name, and I was a little

girl who couldn’t count to twenty.

We do it together. We break the

wheel together.

Jon nods.

JON
You are my Queen, now and always.

Standing before the Iron Throne, Dany steps forward and
kisses the man she loves. A perfect kiss, an expression of
pure love and passion.

We push in on them until we’re tight on their faces -- their
eyes closed, his hand behind her head, her hand on his cheek.

Dany’s eyes open suddenly as she draws a sharp breath.

Jon's eyes open as well, already filling with tears. For a
moment, neither moves, as if moving will make this real.

In a wider angle, we see Jon with his hand still on the hilt
of the dagger he just lodged in Dany’s heart.

Her strength leaves her and she collapses to the marble; he
keeps her in his arms as she falls, kneeling down to the
floor beside her.

He looks down at what he’s done. Terrible. And necessary. He
hopes for one last moment with her.

But her eyes are already glazing over. Winter has come to the
Throne Room. Dany lies dead in his arms, Pieta-style, as the
snow drifts down.

Jon buries his head next to hers and cries.

His mourning is brought to an end by the sound of beating
wings, coming closer, and a great roar.

Jon looks to the place the ceiling used to be, and sees
Drogon wheeling in the sky, heading for the Throne Room.

Drogon lands before him, shaking the throne room’s
foundations. His wings fall to his side, displacing enough
air that Jon has to steel himself against the gust.

Jon doesn't flee. He has no interest in avoiding death; he
has nothing left to live for. He stands and steps away from
Dany’s body.

Drogon moves his head close to Dany’s body. He sniffs at her.
He nudges her gently.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 20.
CONTINUED: (5)

Drogon’s huge brow lowers and his pupils dilate as the worst
is confirmed. His lips raise over teeth as long as short
swords.

The dragon rises up on his hind legs, towering over Jon.

In a beautiful, terrifying tableaux, he roars to the sky, the
embodiment of rage.

He looks down at Jon. We see the fire build up in his throat.
Jon sees it as well. He prepares to die.

But the blast is not for him. Drogon wants to burn the world
but he will not kill Jon.

He breathes fire on the back wall, blasting down what remains
of the great red blocks of stone.

We look over Jon’s shoulder as the fire sweeps toward the
throne-- not the target of Drogon’s wrath, just a dumb
bystander caught up in the conflagration.

We look through the blades of the throne as the flames engulf
it, and blast the wall behind it.

We see the throne in the flames, turning red, then white,
then beginning to lose its form.

We get tight shots of the details melting in silhouette: the
armrests, the iconic fan of swords on the backrest.

The fire stops. The smoke clears revealing a puddle of
smouldering slag where the throne once stood.

Who will sit on the Iron Throne? No one.

Drogon turns back to Dany’s lifeless body and delicately
gathers her up with a claw.

With heavy thrusts of his wings, Drogon takes to the air, and
flies away through the missing roof.

Jon watches him recede, with his mother’s corpse in his
grasp.
EXT. SKY OVER KING'S LANDING - DAY

We follow Drogon over the ruined city with Dany's lifeless
body clutched in his claw.

He heads out toward the eastern sky, flying over Blackwater
Bay. It’s not a dusky beauty shot; it’s gray and lifeless, as
befits a funeral.

We fade to black.
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 21.

INT. TYRION’S CELL - DAY

Tyrion is in a proper cell now, as befits a condemned man.
The intervening weeks have been hard ones; he hasn’t slept,
bathed or eaten well in a long time. His beard is longer, his
hair matted down and filthy.

He sits on the ground in the half light and thinks about the
enormity of all that has happened, and his role in it.

He has no plans, no wants, no desire to effect change or
avoid suffering.

He failed. He is finished.

The bolt slides and the door opens. Grey Worm has come for
him, with four Unsullied. He does not tell Tyrion where he is
going, and Tyrion does not ask.

INT. RED KEEP CORRIDORS - DAY

Grey Worm leads a manacled Tyrion down Red Keep corridors
with the Unsullied behind them. Is Tyrion heading to his own

death? He’1ll find out soon enough.

Tyrion walks toward us.

EXT. DRAGON PIT ENTRY TUNNEL - DAY

In the entryway to the Dragonpit, Tyrion walks between two
lines of Unsullied with Grey Worm still at his side.

[The number of Unsullied has grown, to about 20.]

Tyrion looks at the crumbled walls rising up on either side
of him, still patched with snow on the top.

The landscape is showing signs of a thaw. Weeks have passed
since the day of Dany’s assassination.

Tyrion looks to Grey Worm, who stares straight ahead.

Tyrion faces forward as they emerge into the Dragonpit.

EXT. DRAGON PIT - CONTINUOUS

The most powerful lords and ladies of Westeros are here,
representing all Seven Kingdoms, sitting in similar
circumstances to the summit meeting in 707, though arrayed in
a semicircle.

When they see Tyrion and the Unsullied, they all stand. The
tension is palpable.

(CONTINUED )
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 22.

Present are: The Lady of Winterfell and Wardenness of the
North, SANSA STARK, who sits in the middle of the semicircle.
Arya and BRAN STARK sit to her right. To her left: the Onion
Knight, Davos.

The Lord of the Vale and Warden of the East, ROBIN ARRYN,
with LORD ROYCE beside him.

The Lady of the Iron Islands, YARA GREYJOY. The Lord of the
Stormlands and Warden of the South, GENDRY BARATHEON. The
lord of the Riverlands, EDMURE TULLY. The new PRINCE OF
DORNE.

BRIENNE OF TARTH. SAMWELL TARLY. A smattering of ND lords.

And behind them all, and on either side, lining the walls of
the Dragonpit: sixty Unsullied. A show of force that leaves
no doubt as to who controls King’s Landing.

Grey Worm leads Tyrion up onto the platform.
For a moment there is silence.

Tyrion and Sansa look at each other for a beat before Sansa
sits. The other lords follow suit. She turns to Grey Worm.

SANSA
Where is Jon?

GREY WORM
We have him. He is our prisoner.

SANSA
So is Lord Tyrion. They were both
to be brought to this gathering.

GREY WORM
We will decide what we do with our
prisoners. This is our city now.

SANSA
If you look outside the walls of
your city, you'll find thousands of
Northmen who will explain to you
why harming Jon Snow is not in your
interest.

GREY WORM
And you will find thousands of
Unsullied who believe that it is.

Some murmurs of support. And some dissent. Yara stands:
YARA
Some of you may be quick to

forgive. The Ironborn are not. I
swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

SANSA
You swore to follow a tyrant.

YARA
She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei
is gone because of her. And Jon
Snow put a knife in her heart. Let
the Unsullied give him what he
deserves.

ARYA
Say another word about killing my
brother and I’1l1 cut your throat.

Yara opens her mouth to respond but sees the look on Arya’s
face. Yara is as tough as they come, but Arya-- Arya’s
different.

She sits as Davos stands.

DAVOS
Friends. Please. We’ve been cutting
each other’s throats long enough.
(to Grey Worm)
Torgo Nudho... am I saying that
properly?

Grey Worm just stares back at him, giving him nothing.

DAVOS
If it weren’t for you and your men,
we would have lost the war with the
dead. This country owes you a debt
we can never repay.
(beat)
But let us try.

He looks to the men and women around him, then proceeds with
the proposition they’ve discussed.

DAVOS

There’s land in the Reach, good
land. The people who used to live
there are gone. Make it your own.
Start your own House, with the
Unsullied as your bannermen.

(beat)
We’ve had enough war. Thousands of
you, thousands of them... you know
how it ends. We need to find a
better way.

GREY WORM
We do not need payment. We need
justice. All of us who owe our
lives and freedom to Daenerys
Stormborn need justice.

Jon Snow killed our Queen. He

TYRION
It’s not for you to decide.

These are the first words Tyrion has spoken. Everyone turns
to look at him.

GREY WORM
You are not here to speak. Everyone
has heard enough words from you.

TYRION
You're right. And no one’s any the
better for it.
(beat)
But it’s not for you to decide.

Sansa is pleased, until he turns to her:
TYRION
And it’s not for you to decide,
either.

SANSA
Who, then?

TYRION
The rightful ruler of Westeros. Jon
Snow committed his crime here. His
fate is for our king to decide. Or
our queen.

ROYCE
We don’t have a king or queen.

Tyrion’s gaze passes over the assembled lords and ladies.
TYRION
You're the most powerful people in
Westeros. Choose one.

Tyrion looks up at his keeper, Grey Worm.

Grey Worm does not trust anything Tyrion says or does. But he
looks to the lords and ladies.

GREY WORM
Make your choice, then.

Everyone looks at everyone else. This is not what they came
here to do. But they don’t appear to have any better options.

Edmure stands proudly.

EDMURE

My lords and ladies. I suppose this
is the most important moment of our
lives. What we decide today will
reverberate through the annals of
history. I stand before you as one
of the senior lords in the country,
a veteran of two wars. I'd like to
think my experience has led to some
small skill in statecraft and-

SANSA
Uncle.

Edmure is a little annoyed to be cut off in mid-flow,
especially by his niece.

SANSA
Please sit.

Edmure can't quite believe what he's seeing, but the chuckles
and suppressed grins of the other lords make him realize that
his newborn hopes of being king were just squashed by a girl.

He sits.

A tense silence as various lords and ladies glance around the
circle, wondering who will vie for power next.

ROYCE
We have to choose someone.

SAMWELL
Why just us?

Everyone looks at Samwell. He stands uncomfortably, steels
himself and soldiers on.

SAMWELL
We represent all the great houses.
But whomever we choose, they won’t
just rule over lords and ladies.
Maybe the decision about what's
best for everyone should be left
to... well, everyone.

The attending lords and ladies stare at him for an
incredulous moment before breaking out into laughter.

EDMURE
Maybe we should give the dogs a
vote as well.

ROYCE
I’ll ask my horse!

They laugh at Sam until he sits back down.

EDMURE
(to Tyrion)
I suppose you want the crown?

TYRION
Me? The Imp? Half the people hate
me for serving Daenerys. The other
half hate me for betraying her. I
can’t think of a worse choice.

DAVOS
Who, then?

Tyrion has no immediate answer.
No one else does, either.
Grey Worm grows impatient.

TYRION
I’ve had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks. About our
bloody history. About the mistakes
we've made.

He looks from face to face.

TYRION

What unites people? Armies? Gold?
Flags?

(shaking his head)
Stories. There is nothing in the
world more powerful than a good
story. Nothing can stop it, no
enemy can defeat it.

(beat)
And who has a better story than
Bran the Broken?

With astonishment, all the gathered lords turn to look at
Bran, sitting in his wheelchair.

Sansa and Arya look more shocked than anyone.

Bran doesn’t look shocked. Simply uninterested. But that
doesn’t bother Tyrion.

TYRION
The boy who fell from a high tower
and lived. He knew he’d never walk
again. So he learned to fly.

All of the gathered lords and ladies study Bran as Tyrion
speaks.

(CONTINUED )

TYRION

He crossed beyond the Wall -- a
crippled boy -- and became the
Three Eyed Raven. He is our memory,
the keeper of all our stories --
all the tragedy, all the comedy,
the wars, the weddings and births
and massacres and famines. Our
triumphs. Our defeats. Our past.

(beat)
Who better to lead us into the
future?

As Tyrion speaks, Bran looks down at the armrest of his
wheelchair. A tiny pill bug crawls along the wood.

SANSA
Bran has no interest in ruling. And
he can’t father children.

Bran puts his hand down and lets the bug crawl into his palm.

TYRION
Good. He’1ll never thrust his awful
spawn upon us to rule after he
dies.

Tyrion looks up at Grey Worm, still standing next to him.

TYRION
That is the wheel our queen wanted
to break.

As much as Grey Worm hates it, he knows Tyrion is at least
partly right.

TYRION
From now on, when a monarch dies,
the lords of Westeros can gather on
this spot and pick the next one,
just as we’re doing now.

Nods all around display general consensus on this notion.
Tyrion looks at Bran.

TYRION
I know you don’t want it. I know
you don’t care about power. But I
ask you now: if we choose you, will
you wear the crown? Will you lead
the Seven Kingdoms, to the best of
your abilities, from this day until
your last day?

Bran sets his hand back on the arm rest and lets the pill bug
crawl off and resume his journey.

Finally Bran looks around, at all the important people
waiting to hear his decision. He looks at Tyrion.

Bran doesn’t really smile anymore but there is the smallest
hint of amusement on his face as he answers.

BRAN
Why do you think I came all this
way?

A strange response but Tyrion has come to expect strange
answers from Bran.

TYRION
To Brandon of House Stark, first of
his name, I say: Aye.

Tyrion looks around the circle.

Edmure is still be miffed he wasn't given serious
consideration, but he expects he'll have influence at court
if his crippled nephew is ruling.

EDMURE
Aye.

Gendry is happy to go along.

GENDRY
Aye.

Yara has heard that her brother died defending Bran. She
knows this choice would make Theon happy.

YARA
Aye.

Brienne is a Stark loyalist and represents House Tarth.

BRIENNE
Aye.

DAVOS
I’m not sure I get a vote. But aye.

One by one, the lords of Westeros express their support for
Bran. Tyrion is very pleased.

Finally, it comes to Sansa. She does not address Tyrion. She
turns and speaks directly to Bran.

SANSA
I love you, little brother. I
always will. You’1l be a good king.

Arya smiles.

Tyrion is stunned but also a little impressed. He looks to
Bran.

Everyone in attendance, the most powerful men and women in
Westeros, they all look to their new king, eager to see how
he handles the first crisis of his reign.

Bran watches Sansa for a beat. He nods.

Tyrion looks around for objections or further secessions.
Yara? Gendry? Edmure?

None of them speak.

TYRION
All hail Bran the Broken, First of
his Name, King of the Andals and
the First Men, Lord of the Six
Kingdoms, and Protector of the
Realm.

All stand and shout Bran’s name:

ALL
All hail Bran the Broken!

For the first time in a long time, Tyrion dares to feel a
tiny bit good about something. Until:

BRAN
Lord Tyrion. You will be my Hand.

Tyrion truly hates this suggestion.

TYRION
No, your grace. I don’t want it.

BRAN
And I don’t want to be king.

I don’t deserve it. I thought I was
wise, but I wasn’t. I thought I

Grey Worm pulls a still-manacled Tyrion closer.

GREY WORM
This man is a criminal. He deserves
justice.

BRAN

He just got it. He’s made many
terrible mistakes. He’s going to
spend the rest of his life fixing
them.

Grey Worm is not sold. He looks right at Bran.

GREY WORM
It is not enough.

Tyrion looks to Bran as well. His life depends on the new
king’s response to this impasse.

INT. CELL - DUSK

Jon looks ragged. He hasn’t slept, hasn’t eaten, hasn’t
bathed. He looks like a man who doesn’t care whether he lives
or dies.

Tyrion has been explaining the outcome of the kingsmoot to
Jon, who barely seems to listen.

TYRION
Giving you to the Unsullied for
execution would start a war.
Letting you walk free would start a
war.

Tyrion waits but Jon doesn’t look at him.

EXT. RED KEEP BATTLEMENT - DAY

Jon exits the tower that once was his prison.

Two NIGHT’S WATCHMEN wait for him. His escort to his life
sentence at the Wall.

Together, they walk along the battlements.
Jon stops to look down on Blackwater Bay, far beneath him,
and sees the remaining ships of Dany’s fleet. Most are

anchored, a few are still sailing in.

From this vantage point, we can see the remaining Unsullied
waiting to board with characteristic orderliness.

The remaining Dothraki do the same; they have dismounted
their horses, and walk them up gangplanks.

EXT. KING'S LANDING - DOCKS - DAY

At sea level now, Jon passes a couple of Dothraki leading
their horses. He looks up to a ship deck and sees Grey Worm.
[Jon continues walking, followed by his Night’s Watch
guards. ]

They make eye contact. Jon doesn’t say or do anything; he
knows Grey Worm hates him more than any man alive, and he
understands why.

Grey Worm turns away without acknowledging Jon.

EXT. SHIP’S DECK - DAY
Grey Worm walks to the helm. In the background, his men (not
wearing helmets), raise the sails, pull in the gangplank,

An UNSULLIED CAPTAIN (no helmet) speaks to him in Valyrian.

Watch guards.

From behind, we can see the Stark siblings standing on the
distant dock.

Jon stands in front of Sansa. He hasn’t entirely forgiven her
for betraying the oath he made her swear in the godswood.

Jon nods. He knows she loves him. He knows she only wants

He hesitates.

She accepts the compliment.

But they’ve lost their true king.

Jon and Sansa embrace.

Over Sansa’s shoulder, Jon sees Arya crying. She hasn’t cried

INT. RED KEEP - KINGSGUARD CHAMBER - DAY

The cover of The White Book smacks the table, as Brienne
flips it open.

Wearing her new Kingsguard uniform, Brienne pages through the
book. We see the names on the pages:

Ser Duncan the Tall. Ser Arthur Dayne. Ser Barristan Selmy.
Finally, she finds it: Ser Jaime Lannister.

Jaime’s page is brief and unfinished, as it was the last time
we saw it.

Brienne dips a quill in ink and begins to write, to finish
the rest of Jaime’s story. We watch her face as she does, and
catch snippets of her writing:

...took Riverrun without loss of life... outwitted the
Targaryen forces to seize Highgarden... fought the Army of
the Dead at Winterfell... died protecting his Queen.

Brienne takes a moment to think about a man she both hated
and loved, often at the same time.

Then she collects herself, her duty done. She has somewhere
important to be. She closes The White Book.
INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

Tyrion enters along the colonnade. The council chamber is
empty, as is the map room.

He looks out at the map, his sister’s plan for world
domination, smashed to pieces where the falling masonry hit.

Then he turns and steps into the council chamber. He looks at

the Hand emblem on the chair at the far side of the table.
Then down at the same emblem pinned to his chest.

He sits in the Hand’s chair. How the fuck did this happen?
How the fuck did he end up here, alive, with power he no
longer wants or believes he deserves?

He glances around at the other chairs surrounding the table.
Hmm.

He stands up and does some rearranging. He’s not being
theatrical about it like the time he dragged the chair to
annoy Cersei. He just wants everything to be right this time.

Hearing approaching footsteps, he sits done again in the Hand
chair.

The rest of the council arrives: SAMWELL TARLY, BRONN, Davos.
He nods at them, and they nod back as they head to their
seats. Davos sits to Tyrion’s left, next to two empty chairs.
Across from Davos, Bronn sits next to another two empty
chairs.

Samwell carries a book. He wears the Grandmaester robes and a
chain with a single healing link.

TYRION
What’s this?

Sam drops the book down in front of Tyrion, its title
embossed on its leather cover: A Song of Ice and Fire.

SAMWELL

Tyrion takes the book in hand.

SAMWELL

wars following the death of King
Robert.

I suppose I come in for some heavy

criticism.

Tyrion pages through the book to verify his absence therein.
God dammit!

Hearing approaching footsteps and the squeaking of wheels,
Tyrion closes the book.

Brienne and King Bran enter. A Kingsguard pushes Bran, and
two more follow behind them. Brienne wears no helmet, but the
other three do.

Everyone stands as they wheel Bran to the head of the table.

EVERYONE

Everyone sits. Brienne sits down next to Bran. He surveys the
table.

Kingdoms and Protector of the

Bran smiles slightly and nods.

Pod swings him around and pushes him from the room.
Exit Bran. Everyone sits back down.
Looking around the table, Tyrion gets down to business.

one. We have hungry people to feed.
Can we expect some assistance in
this regard?

BRONN
Indeed we can.

TYRION
Lord Davos, we have an armada to
rebuild and ports to repair.

DAVOS
We have.
(looks at Bronn)
These projects will begin at once,
as soon as the Master of Coin and
Lord of Lofty Titles provides
funding.

BRONN
The Master of Coin looks forward to
helping the Master of Ships. But
first he has to insure we’re not
wasting coin, or soon there won't
be no more coin.

DAVOS
Any more.

BRONN
You Master of Grammar now, too?

Moving on:

TYRION
Grandmaester, it is my theory,
based on my years of work on the
Casterly Rock sewers, that clean
water leads to a healthier
population.

Sam agrees and begins to expound.

SAMWELL
I’ve done some research on this
subject [and it turns out]--

Bronn interrupts.

BRONN
The strong live and the weak don't.

TYRION
(ignoring Bronn)
Let’s find the best builders and
set them to the task.

We begin to drift away from the table as these smart,
experienced people plan a better future.

BRONN
Speaking of builders... all the
best brothels burned down. The
Master of Coin is willing to fund
reconstruction.

Brienne gives him a disapproving look.

We pull back through the columns, and across the rubble-
covered map room.

SAMWELL
Archmaester Ebrose is less than
enthusiastic about the salutary
effects of brothels.

BRONN
I imagine he isn’t using them
properly.

BRIENNE

I think we can all agree that ships
take precedence over brothels.

BRONN
I think that is a very presumptuous
statement.
TYRION
You know, I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel...
EXT. THE WALL/CASTLE BLACK - DAY

Spring is coming, and it is slowly starting to warm up.

The Wall weeps, as the temperature rises above freezing for
the first time in many months.

Looking down the Wall to Castle Black, three riders approach
the castle gates.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK GATES - DAY

A NW BROTHER opens the gates of Castle Black to find a
mounted Jon Snow and his companions.

From atop his horse, Jon sees who is waiting for him on the
balcony where Lord Commander Mormont used to stand: TORMUND.

Jon and his companions enter the courtyard, and the gates
close behind them.
INT. CASTLE BLACK CHAMBER - DAY

Longclaw in its scabbard. Jon’s hand reaches into frame and
takes it from the table.
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 4l.

INT. SHIP CABIN - DAY

Hands fasten a sword belt around a waist -- but the sword in
the belt is Needle, not Longclaw, and the hands belong to
Arya (we do not see her face). Match cut on her hand to

INT. WINTERFELL CHAMBER - DAY

A leather glove sliding onto Sansa’s hand with the aid of an
ATTENDANT. From here we move to shots of other costume pieces
being put on Sansa by the attendant, including leather armor
pieces. We do not see Sansa’s face.

INT. CASTLE BLACK CHAMBER - DAY

Jon puts the last item in his pack and fastens it shut. We
see a bit more of him, but at an oblique angle and/or
shrouded in shadow.

INT. SHIP CABIN - DAY

We see where Arya is for the first time: below decks on a
ship. We see her obliquely as well, as she turns to the
stairs and the light above.

INT. WINTERFELL CHAMBER - DAY

We tilt down on Sansa as the final piece of her costume is
put on. When the dresser steps away, we see Sansa
unobstructed for the first time.

Sansa stands, lifting her head from frame, and we match cut
to

INT. CASTLE BLACK CHAMBER - DAY

As Jon puts on his cloak, we tilt up from his torso to his
face. Once again, he wears all black. It always was his

color.

He steps forward, and we pan with him as he wipes camera into

INT. WINTERFELL CORRIDOR - DAY

We follow Sansa down a Winterfell corridor.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK WALKWAY - DAY

We follow Jon down a Castle Black walkway.
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 42.

INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - DAY

We follow Arya down a ship’s corridor, up the stairs toward
the light.

EXT. SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS

Arya emerges into the sunlight into a close up. She takes in
the scene for a beat, then steps forward.

INT. WINTERFELL GREAT HALL - DAY

We’re behind Sansa as she turns the corner into a room full
of Northern lords.

She regards her new subjects as she approaches them.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK MAIN COURTYARD - DAY

Jon walks down the last few stairs to the ground level, where
the last of the Free Folk await him: a few hundred men, women
and children.

Jon steps forward into the sea of waiting faces. There is no
suspicion in those faces, and no awe. Only trust. The Night’s
Watch used to hunt them, but they will follow this Night's
Watchman.

We follow Jon in profile as he passes through the wildlings
to his left and his right (closer to camera). We match cut on
their passing vertical shapes to

EXT. SHIP’S DECK - DAY

Arya proceeding in profile down the deck, past deckhands,
ship’s masts and riggings. A similar match cut to

INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

Sansa, as she moves down the center of the Great Hall, with
northern lords on either side of her. As she passes them,
they drop to one knee and bow their heads.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD - DAY

Overhead shot tracking Jon’s progress through the wildlings.

EXT. SHIP’S DECK - DAY

Matching overhead shot of Arya, as she approaches the bow.
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 43.

INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

Matching overhead shot of Sansa, as she approaches the throne
at the end of the room.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD - DAY

Jon meets up with Tormund who is already on horseback.

Someone else is waiting for him as well here: GHOST. The wolf
nuzzle’s Jon's face, and he pets the scruff of Ghost’s neck.

Then Jon takes his horse from the Night’s Watchman holding
it, and mounts up.

INT. CASTLE BLACK TUNNEL - DAY

In a shot mirroring the first image of the pilot, we see Jon
and Tormund through the grate of the tunnel as the gate

rises, from a POV inside the tunnel.

[We do not see the wildlings behind them. ]

EXT. SHIP’S DECK - DAY

On the bow of the ship, Arya steps into frame and looks west.
The Arya who left for Braavos was still a girl. This is a
different person altogether. She has been No One. She has
been Arya Stark of Winterfell. Who will she be next?

We wrap around Arya and pull back down the deck as her ship
sails west.

INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

In contrary motion to the above pull-back, we push down the
aisle as someone puts a crown on Sansa’s head.

On either side of the camera, the lords rise to their feet
and raise their swords to the ceiling.

NORTHERN LORDS
The Queen in the North! The Queen
in the North! The Queen in the
North!

We clear the lords and continue to move into a close up of
Sansa’s face.

The Queen in the North.
GAME OF THRONES “The Iron Throne" 44,

EXT. TUNNEL - DAY

In a two shot that mirrors another shot from the pilot, Jon
and Tormund wait for the gate to finish opening.

We see them emerge from the tunnel. Things still look very
similar to the pilot shots, except Ghost is with them.

Then some Free Folk step into the fg, following them.

Overhead, from the top of the wall, we see more emerge,
following Jon and Tormund.

And in a much wider side angle: Jon and Tormund with hundreds
of Free Folk following behind them, walking away from the
Wall. Many children are amongst them.

They all cross the No Man’s Land between the Wall and the
northern forest. Patches of grass show through what used to
be frozen tundra.

Ghost lopes out ahead of Jon, as Jon rides toward camera.
Tormund rides beside him, and the last of the Free Folk are
behind them.

Jon and company ride away from camera. As Ghost, Jon and the
rest cross the treeline, we slowly pull back, and watch them
disappear into the forest.
