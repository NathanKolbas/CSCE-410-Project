THE
BRADY BUNCH
MOULE

A
Screenplay

Sherwood Schwartz
and

Lloyd J. Schwartz

December 29, 1992
THIRD DRAFT - POLISH
 

FADE IN:
"BRADY" THEME OVER MAIN TITLE CREDITS

The familiar checkerboard "Brady" blue, just as we oneys
saw at the beginning of the television show.

CAROL, MARCIA, JAN, CINDY, all pop onto the screen; then
MIKE, GREG, PETER, BOBBY, pop onto the screen, and we are
amazed at the similarity of the new Bradys to the original
Bradys. Mike and Greg sport the 1970’s big curly hair,
and Peter and Bobby’s hair is long, too. Carol has her
fli which all America remembers. Marcia and Jan have
their beautiful long hair as before, and Cindy "the
youngest one in curls". Jan wears glasses as she did in
the later episodes. As the theme continues they all look
around in every direction. Then ALICE, in her unremovable
blue uniform, takes her place in the center box just as
the theme ends. :

END MAIN TITLE CREDITS

EXT. BRADY HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

The very familiar Brady house in all its suburban glory.

INT. BOYS’ BEDROOM - DAY - CLOSE ANGLE - BATHROOM DOOR

Greg’s fist pounds on the door, and WE PULL BACK AND WIDEN
to see the frustrated Greg, Peter, and Bobby -- as well

as the familiar bunk bedded boys’ bedroom. The boys are
in robes and pajamas. _

GREG
Marcia, will you come out of there?
We have to get ready to rehearse!

PETER
Yeah! Stop brushing your hair!

BOBBY
Marcia, I’ve got to go!

JAN .,
We want to get in there, Marcia. We've
got hair, too, you know.

Cindy pulls her own trademark pigtails in opposite
directions.

CINDY

I’ve got hair on both sides.

INT. KIDS’ BATHROOM

MARCIA
Seventy-two, seventy-three,

INT. BOYS’ BEDROOM

Bobby is dancing from one foot to another foot. Greg sees
Bobby’s dam is about to burst. Bobby starts toward the
window.

GREG -
Bobby, not out the window!

cuT TO

EXT. BRADY BACKYARD - DAY

(NOTE: A word about the backyard: it’s exactly the same
as the Brady yard we remember. Except it’s real grass
instead of articial turf; a real backyard.)

In addition to the usual Brady objects in the backyard,
the yard is cluttered with remnants of various episodes;
a teeter-totter, Greg's surfboard, a club house, and, of
course, Tiger’s doghouse. TIGER, who had been lost after
the first-season’s episodes, has found his way back home
for this film.

One major addition has been made to the backyard. It’s
a practice platform for the Brady kids to rehearse their
song and dance numbers. _ It’s about a foot high and ten
by six, with different size circular platforms for each
of the kids to stand on.
ANGLE - TOWARD HOUSE

As all six Brady kids stream out‘of the family room now
dressed in regular 1973 clothes; bellbottom pants,
mini-skirts, etc. They are jabbering excitedly as they
head for the rehearsal platform.

GREG
Pete, punch the button,

Peter crosses to a tape recorder (1973 version) and starts
the music accompaniment. Then he quickly hops up on the
platform with the rest of the kids as the music starts.
VARIOUS ANGLES - MUSICAL NUMBER

OPENING CREDITS roll as the Brady kids rehearse the number.

They each have half a jump rope to simulate a mike and
cord. Jan sings the lead.

ANGLE - GREG

As the music ends, Greg shuts off the tape recorder.

END CREDITS

JAN
There! I did the lead, and I Was really
good.

GREG

Yeah, but we’re not doing that song in
the contest. We’re doing "Good Time
Music".

JAN
(snidely)
Oh, where you and Marcia have the lead.

MARCIA
That’s right, Jan.

JAN
That’s how it always is. Marcia sings
the lead vocal. Marcia gets the lead
in the school play. Marcia gets a new
boyfriend. Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!

PETER
Jan, cheer up. They’re not letting me
sing lead vocal either.

MARCIA
That’s because we want to win. Your
voice cracks like a broken mirror.’

Marcia sings an impression of Peter’s voice cracking in
"Time to Change".

cracking)
When it’s time to change, then it’s time

PETER
Look who thinks she’s a prima dona.

ANGLE - THE TWO YOUNGEST BRADYS

CINDY
What’s a prima dona?

BOBBY
{not knowing either)
Everybody knows what a prima dona is.
Don’t you know anything, Cindy?

CINDY n
Sure. I know that you -don’t know what
a prima dona is either.

Cindy sticks her tongue out at him. Meanwhile: _

GREG
Look, this is the amateur finals at the
Hollywood Bowl. And we have to win
first prize. We’ve got to put our best
face forward.

JAN :
What’s the matter with my face?

MARCIA /
Would you like that in alphabetical
order?

Jan flies at Marcia and grabs her hair and starts to pull.
In return, Marcia grabs Jan’s hair, and starts to pull.
There’s a lot of yelling as Greg and Peter try to pull the
girls apart.

INT. BRADY KITCHEN

Carol and Alice are at the stove in the good old orange
and olive colored kitchen, circa 1973. They can see the
backyard through the windows in the den. They can also
hear the racket.

ALICE a Re
Doesn’t sound much like music to me, .
Mrs. Brady.

 

CAROL
I'd better go out there, and put some
harmony into the act.

As Alice stirs something on the stove, Carol strides “!*
purposefully to the backyard.

EXT. BRADY BACKYARD

As Carol enters, and moves quickly toward Jan and Marcia,
who are still tugging at each other’s hair. Carol gets
between them.

CAROL
Girls, cut this out!

As the girls separate:

MARCIA ,
Jan started it. a

JAN
No, I didn’t. Marcia started it. The .
day I was born. BS

CAROL
We're Bradys. Bradys don’t fight with
each other.

a

Those are magic words.

MARCIA/JAN
(contritely)
Sorry, Mom.
CAROL
Now why don’t you change into your
-regular clothes, so you’1ll be ready for
dinner when Dad gets home?

Now that order has been restored, Carol returns to the
house.

in the alcove at the dining room table and is fluffing up
the floral centerpiece -- one of her primary occupations.

 

ANGLE ~ THE DOOR

Mike enters with his briefcase and calls out the
expected...

MIKE
Hi, Honey, I’m home.
BACK TO SCENE

Perking up at the news, she meets him in the center of the
room. She kisses him. He savors it.

MIKE
(continuing)
With greetings like that, I should stop Sy
by two or three times a: day.

CAROL *
Just what I told the milkman.

They share a laugh. Mike puts down his briefcase.

MIKE
Well, which one of the kids needs a
lecture?

CAROL

How’d you guess?

MIKE
No guess. Between us, we’ve got six
kids. Somebody always needs a lecture.

INT. MIKE’S DEN - NIGHT

The small room just off the living room. It’s down three
steps to the loveseat and drafting table. It’s the Brady
equivalent of the wood shed. Jan is hearing it from Mike
and Carol.

JAN
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. That’s all I
hear. It’s enough to make me puke.

MIKE
Bradys don’t talk like that.

JAN
Sorry, Dad, but it’s just not fair.
She’s got pretty hair, and a pretty
face. I’ve got glasses and braces.

CAROL
You’ve also got a family that loves you.

JAN
Big wow.

MIKE
Jan, right now Marcia seems to have it
all. :

CAROL
That’s right, sweetheart. Your turn
will come.

JAN
That’s what you’ve been telling me since
I was two.

MIKE :
You just have to be patient. There’s
an old Chinese proverb, "Patience is
the greatest virtue".

JAN
Yeah? Well, I’m sick of being virtuous,
too.

With that, Jan storms out of the roon.

ANGLE - MIKE AND CAROL

CAROL
I know just how she feels. When I was
a little girl, I felt the same way about
my sister.

MIKE
You don’t have a sister.

CAMERA ZEROES IN ON OUTSIDE PRISON WALL AND DIRT AREA

CAMERA MOVES IN FURTHER TO SHOW there is movement in the
dirt. Then more movement. Then the dirt seems to be

falling back into the prison. Then we see a big kitchen
spoon. Then the hand holding the spoon. The hand has a
distinctive tattoo with the numbers: 1,2,3, hand etched.

WIDER SHOT - CAMERA MOVES WIDER ©

as the crewcutted ROCKY pulls himself out of the hole into

You never said there’d be two of you.

ROCKY
Clarence was my cellmate. And he
deserved a break today.

Clarence doesn’t say anything. He has a hulking presence
and rarely speaks.

ROCKY
(continuing)
You bring everything?

Junior hands Rocky a package. He opens it and takes out
two guns and a six pack of beer.

JUNIOR
There it is, Dad. One six pack and two
guns. I guess the other gun is for
Clarence.

ROCKY
Good guess, kid.

Rocky realizes which car they're in.
ROCKY

_ (continuing)
This is the car I bought you, ain’t it

JUNIOR
Yeah.

ROCKY
Very smart. Busting me out in your own
car. They’1ll tag us for sure. :

VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE

MUSIC: HARD DRIVING 1970’S SONG ("BORN TO BE WILD"
STEPPENWOLF)

Junior is a good driver and manages to elude the cops.

He cuts off a car, and makes a hard left onto the Santa
Monica Freeway heading west to the Pacific Coast Highway.
Then under the overpass and onto the coast route itself.
The cops come alongside, but Junior uses a moving van as
interference to lose them as the pursuers go up the coast
and Junior speeds up the ramp.

Rocky sees a cliff to the side.
ROCKY

Pull over.

Junior does so. Then the boy sees the cliff and
understands his father’s plan.

JUNIOR
Come on, Dad. The car’s got sentimental
value.

ROCKY

Just get out. If you can’t say goodbye
to your wheels, leave the drivin’ to
me.

Clarence gets out. Then Junior gets out. Rocky hands his
son the beer and guns.

ANGLES - THE BLUE VALIANT

Rocky steps on the gas, and careens toward the cliff. Just
before the car goes over, Rocky bails out and tumbles to
the ground. The car sails through the air then smashes

t9 the ground where it breaks apart and bursts into
flames.

AANGLE - ROCKY AND JUNIOR
Rocky gets up and dusts himself off as Junior walks up to
him. Junior looks distraught.

ANGLE ~ CLARENCE

He smiles as he enjoys watching the car explode.

JUNIOR
I had some books and drawings in the
back seat.

Rocky takes a folded map from his pocket.

ROCKY
The only drawing you ever made worth
spit was this map of the prison. you
got every one of them pipes and wires
in the right place, or me and Clarence
never coulda dug our way out.

Clarence joins them.
ROCKY
(continuing)
Right, Clarence?

Clarence nods. Rocky pockets the drawing and starts off
down the street. Junior and Clarence follow.

cUuT TO

EXT. CLINTON AVENUE - NIGHT

Rocky, Junior and Clarence move down the block. Rocky
seems to be looking for something.

JUNIOR
They all look the same to me.

ROCKY
We need the right house. We need money,
and we need a car.

ANGLE - HOUSES - PAN SHOT - ROCKY’S POV

Rocky and Junior look at the houses and the camera lingers
at the Brady house. It seems to have a faint glow around
it, and the muted STRAINS OF THE "BRADY" THEME make it even
more obvious what their choice will be.

BACK TO SCENE

ROCKY
That’s the house, Junior.

JUNIOR
You sure?

ROCKY
Sure, I’m sure. Whoever lives here has
gotta have cars, and plenty of dough.

Junior and Clarence follow as Rocky goes down the driveway
and into the backyard.

EXT. BRADY BACKYARD
They pause at the garage and look inside.

ROCKY
(whispering)
Six bicycles? Six kids? They gotta
be crazy.

Rocky and Junior move to the far side of the backyard and
case the joint. Clarence hangs back, as a lookout,
listening for any unusual sounds.

ROCKY
(continuing)
This place is perfect....We’1ll hang out
til morning. After the kids go to
school, we’1l move in, take some money,
some clothes, grab a car and get out.

ANGLE - TIGER

The Bradys’ sheepdog, Tiger, comes out of his doghouse,
sees the two intruders and starts barking. Rocky raises
a gun, and aims it at Tiger. Junior pulls his arm down.

JUNIOR
Dad, it’s just a dog.

Tiger ignores the warning and keeps barking.

cuT TO

INT. MIKE AND CAROL’S BEDROOM

Mike and Carol hear Tiger and wake up. They turn on the
lamps on the nightstands. Both of their bathrobes are
carefully laid out on the foot of his bed.

It must be. That’s the only dog we’ve

got.

CAROL :
Want to go see what’s bothering him?

Obeying her suggestion, he gets out of bed, puts on one
sleeve of his robe, then thinks better of it.

MIKE
Why don’t we give it a minute? Chances

are Tiger just saw a squirrel or
something.

CUT BACK TO

EXT. BRADY BACKYARD
Tiger is still holding Rocky, Junior and Clarence at bay.
JUNIOR
People would hear a shot, Dad. Some
food would keep him quiet.

ROCKY
Hey, we got better thar food.

With that, Rocky takes a beer can, pops the top, and pours
some in Tiger’s water dish. Tiger immediately shuts up,
laps up the lager and hiccups.

CUT BACK TO

INT. MIKE AND CAROL’S BEDROOM - ANGLE - MIKE
He reacts to the fact that Tiger stopped barking.
MIKE
See? I told you it was nothing.
(then, romantically) .

But as long as Tiger woke us up --
Mike starts to take off his robe, then hops into bed. He
eases over toward Carol’s side, then reacts as he sees

Carol is fast asleep. He shrugs, and prepares for a less
active night.

AS CAMERA SURVEYS the room. As ‘seen in the first scene,
each wall area is individualized for the child sleeping
in the bed underneath it. Cindy has the pretty picture
of a cat. Marcia has a picture of Darryl, and Jan has an
evil punk rock poster. SLOW PAN of the sleeping girls.
Cindy is sleeping with her favorite doll, Kitty Karry-All.
Marcia has an angelic smile. When the camera reaches Jan,
her eyes are open. She has a diabolical look and quietly
sneaks out of bed. She crosses to the desk and removes

a pair of wicked looking scissors. She skulks back to the
sleeping Marcia. Jan takes the scissors and --
miraculously without waking Marcia -- cuts away at her
older sister’s long blonde hair.

ANGLE - CINDY

Cindy awakens, and sees Jan hovering "Norman Bates-like"
over Marcia.

CINDY
(in a horrified
whisper)
Jan, what are you doing?

NEW ANGLE

As Jan continues to cut Marcia’s locks...

JAN
Something I should have done a long time

ago.

CINDY
You shouldn’t do that to Marcia. She’s
so pretty.

JAN

Yeah? Well, I’m a little sick of
everybody telling me how pretty Marcia

is.
CINDY
Stop it. Stop it right now.
JAN
You know something? You really bug me,
too.
Jan crosses quickly to Cindy and -- with a well-timed snip

-- clips off one of Cindy’s pigtails. Twirling it like
a trophy she hops back to her bed and settles down
victoriously.

practice, glee club, drama class, Sunflower Girls, Frontier
Scouts, etc., etc. PULL BACK TO find Alice making
breakfast. She has a plate of hotcakes and puts them on

Sam laughs at his own joke.

MRS. STONE
Sam, you’re lucky. The meat is always

Rocky is opening all the drawers. He looks through a

Clarence, who bites on them, and shakes his head.

ROCKY
The guy is too cheap to buy his wife
real gold. He’s keeping it all in cash
someplace.

JUNIOR
Why don’t we just grab a car and go?
Why do we need so much money?

machinery.

He slips on the Wesson Oil. He is followed by the others,

congratulations:

CLARENCE

with a pitcher of beer. Darryl is finishing a bottle of
Coke. *

 

SAM

Take it from me, kid. You can’t trust
women. Not only does Alice drop me for
some clown she just met, she forgets
my bowling average. 123. That’s more
than any man can take. My average is
136. If she knew one thing about me
--it’s my bowling average.

DARRYL
I loved Marcia. I really did. Sure,
I know she thinks she’s perfect, but
it’s not her fault. She’s a Brady.

He takes out his senior prom picture.

DARRYL
Look at her. Isn’t she beautiful? The
theme of the senior prom was Moon River.
You’d think she’d remember it was the
senior prom not the junior prom.

As Darryl is lost in the thought. Sam looks over Darryl’s
shoulder and sees the TV screen.

INT. ATTIC

Rocky, Junior, and Clarence are putting all the Bradys and
Alice in the attic, a place filled with various articles
from various "Brady" episodes.

ROCKY
You people just keep making it worse
for yourselves. Now we have to leave
you up here in the attic till Monday.

Not just you, Bobby. The whole family
will work together on this.

Honey, give me your hands. Alice, take
Mrs. Brady’s. We/’1ll be the anchors up

Immediately, a human chain begins with Mike, Carol and
Alice as the anchor. They move toward the window.

MIKE
(continuing)
Bobby, when you get down, run next door
to the Dittmeyer’s, and phone the
police.

BOBBY
Right, Dad.

EXT. BRADY HOUSE

The oddest of sights. Down the straight wall of the house
are the six Brady kids linked by arms to legs as they lower
toward the ground. Greg’s arms are inside the window,
where Alice, Mike and Carol support most of the weight.
Peter holds on to Greg’s legs, Marcia holds onto Peter’s

legs, Jan

legs, Cindy holds onto Bobby’s legs.

Cindy and Bobby are almost to the ground. Bobhy drops the
last few feet.

NEW ANGLE

To reveal Clarence, Rocky and Junior. Bobby falls into
the arms of Clarence, who catches him. They’ve been
waiting for just such an escape attempt.

ROCKY

You folks just don’t give up. Okay,
everybody into the living room.

Suddenly, the kids all fall into a heap on the grass at
Rocky’s feet.

The Bradys are depressed as. they wait for the full force
of Rocky’s wrath.

ROCKY
Well, another escape attempt goes up
in smoke.

Mrs. Brady, do you know why your kids
were so anxious to win first prize?
Two round trip tickets to Paris were
going to be for you. For your
anniversary.

Carol melts when she hears this.’ In spite of the threat
from Rocky, Carol and Mike embrace their six kids, hugging
them, kissing them, thanking them. |

CLARENCE
Ain’t that something. |

Rocky sees Clarence, who is clearly moved by the sense of
family.

ROCKY
Clarence, you’re not getting soft on
me, are you?

CLARENCE
I can’t help it. They’re Bradys.

ROCKY
I’m getting sick to my stomach.

JUNIOR
Dad, why don’t you and Clarence give
yourselves up?

ROCKY =,
Are you both nuts or something? On
Monday, I waltz into the bank with
Brady, and waltz out with his dough.
We get a car, and we’re on our way.

JUNIOR
You’ll be caught, Dad. I don’t want
to see you caught, and put back in
prison. You’re my dad; I care about
you the same way the Bradys care about
each other.

Junior embraces Rocky. Clarence embraces both of then.
Junior pulls out the map he drew.

JUNIOR
(continuing)
That’s the only reason I drew this map
to break you out in the first place.
So we could be together.

Mike looks at the map that Junior is waving.

MIKE
You drew this map?

JUNIOR
Yeah. Why?

Mike examines it more closely.

JUNIOR

ROCKY

It was perfect, too. Junior’s not much
of a crook, but he sure can make a map.

MIKE
This has all the specs of the air
conditioning ducts, the water mains,
and electric cables. This shows a real
understanding of architecture.

ROCKY
It does?

MIKE
With some schooling and training I think
Junior has the makings of a real

architect. :
ROCKY -
My kid?
MIKE
Yes.
