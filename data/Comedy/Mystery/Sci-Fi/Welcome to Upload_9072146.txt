“Nora”

NORA ANTONY,

cute, defiant, 27, in a profile picture on an app called
“Nitely,” above a 5-possible-star rating that hasn’t been
filled out yet.

REVEAL a dude named BYRON is holding the screen and looking
at the real NORA getting dressed next to a bed.

INT. NY APARTMENT BEDROOM - DECEMBER DAY, 2031 - CONTINUOUS

Nora waits for a shirt to come out of a 3D printer. It’s the
future, guys.

NORA
Hey thanks for the bottle of water.
It’s the little touches get you 5
stars.

She shows him she rated him 5 stars on her version of Nitely
(which is like a Tinder/Uber hybrid.)

BYRON
Cool. Hey, you have time for a
quick fuck before work?

NORA
I really don’t. Maybe if we get
matched up again.

BYRON
Um, I haven’t rated you yet.

NORA
... Really, dude?

BYRON
I mean, two stars can significantly
lower your average...

Nora sighs and starts taking off her clothes.

BYRON (CONT'D)
Awesome. Thanks man.

NORA
No, you know what? Fuck this.
I‘1l take the two.
BYRON
Too bad, bitch. I gave you a one.

NORA
Wow. Okay then, I’1l earn it.

She grabs the shirt and heaves the printer in the air,
leaving as Byron scrambles to catch it.

INT. HALL OUTSIDE BYRON’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Pulling on her shirt, Nora hears a CRASH and smiles. Her
phone dings and she sees a screen: “You have received a 0-

star rating on your last Nitely experience. Would you like
to contest, y/n?” She scowls.

FADE TO BLACK

“Nathan”

EXT. FREEWAY - L.A. - NOVEMBER DAY, A MONTH BEFORE

The freeway is full of SELF-DRIVING CARS shaped like eggs.

INT. NATHAN’S SELF-DRIVING CAR - CONTINUOUS

NATHAN BROWN, 27, things come easily to him, especially
women, edits lines of computer code projected on
windshield/screen.

Nathan's best friend/work partner JAIME ARNAZ is on speaker.

JAIME (V.O.)
There’s some kind of acceptance
bias in the last three lines.

NATHAN
Yeah... what is that?... oh.

He hits a few keys.

JAIME (V.O.)
(tired)
Aw yiss. Nailed it. Okay, the
AGIP protocol still needs work.

NATHAN
God no. I gotta veg a little. See
you later, okay?
JAIME (V.O.)
Dude, we are so close--

Nathan hangs up, then pokes a key. His work is pushed to the
side. He decides to have some fun.

NATHAN
Car?

CAR
(Australian accent female)
Yes, Nathan?

NATHAN
Clean camera lenses please.

CAR
Cleaning...

Little squirts and wipers go off inside and out. While the
car can’t see, Nathan shuts off the car’s brain and hacks
something to drive using the keyboard with the W-A-S-D keys.
He swerves in and out, passing other cars and enjoying the
startled looks. After a few seconds, he hears a SIREN.

NATHAN
Uh oh.

FREEWAY SHOULDER - MOMENTS LATER
Nathan explains out the window.

NATHAN
It just started racing, who knows
why. I’11 take it in to be
serviced asap, swear to God.

REVEAL he’s Facetiming a FEMALE CHP OFFICER on a tablet
attached to a hovering DRONE.

NATHAN (CONT'D)
I’m on my way to my parent’s house
for Thanksgiving -- can you imagine
if they were waiting and my car had
-- I don’t even want to think about
it.

FEMALE CHP OFFICER
Uh huh. Car, what’s your story?
CAR
Don’t know what happened. Lost
consciousness for a minute. Will
update anti-virus software now.

NATHAN
Yeah, you do that. There’s a human
life back here!

FEMALE CHP OFFICER
Okay, you can go. Get it fixed
soon though. I don’t want to see
you again.

NATHAN
Oh no...?

He smiles at her. She laughs, charmed.
CAR
Should I call your long-time
girlfriend Ingrid and tell her you
will be late?
The officer rolls her eyes and flies off.
NATHAN
It’s called being nice. God.

INT. NY SUBWAY - FUTURE DECEMBER DAY —- MORNING

Ads for the big digital afterlives line the car. (“Experience
‘Ternity’ by Spectrum.” “Apple/Intel’s ‘Cove’” “40% off your
first 100 years at Snap-Disney’s ‘Cumulus.’” “You did well,

you deserve Lakeview by Amazon.”)
Nora, squeezed on a bench, glances at the guy next to her.

He’s watching a telenovela called “Amor Despues de la
Muerte.” A man holds his hand up to a giant screen. On the
other side, a woman holds her hand up to touch his. Behind
her is a color-saturated Puerto Rico beach resort.

TELENOVELA WOMAN
Me estas esperando?

TELENOVELA MAN
Dije que lo haria.

Nora leans closer to the guy’s earbud to listen in. The guy
turns and kisses her on the mouth. She rubs her lip with her
sleeve.
NORA
Echh. Fucking commuters.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - FUTURE - OVERCAST DAY - A LITTLE LATER
Nora walks down the crowded sidewalk. Drones fly overhead
like pigeons. The street is crammed with bikes, one of which
bangs into Nora.
NORA
Ow! Fucking bikes!
EXT. AMAZON OFFICE BUILDING - BROOKLYN - DAY

Nora hurries past protesters, holding signs like “Digital
Afterlife is an Abomination to God!”

PROTESTOR
The Works of Man are Shit!

NORA
Fucking Ludds.
INT. AMAZON OFFICE BUILDING ENTRANCE - BROOKLYN - DAY
Employees touch their index finger to a screen and are
allowed to enter. Nora gives the middle finger to the screen,
then uses it to log in. She walks under a sign reading:
“Amazon Lakeview Customer Service.”
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING IN LA (ECHO PARK) - EVENING
An old Tesla Model S (a junker in the future) stops in front
and Jaime runs out. Behind him, the car parks itself.
INT. BROWN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Jaime lets himself in and rushes to the dining room.
JAIME
Hey, Mrs. Brown, sorry I’m late--

whoa!

He sees Nathan sitting next to INGRID KANNERMAN, 28, blonde,
very beautiful but intense, surrounded by Nathan’s family.

JAIME (CONT'D)
Ingrid. What are you -- I mean, am
I crashing something?
Ingrid nods. Nathan’s Mom, who is smoking a joint, waves off
his concern.

NATHAN’S MOM
Pshh, Jaime, you’re always welcome.
Nathan, get him a chair.

JAIME
I'll help.

EXT. APARTMENT BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

JAIME
The fuck?! She always has
Thanksgiving with her family.

NATHAN
Invited herself. I didn’t think it
was a great idea but she started
crying, and I can’t handle crying.

JAIME
You could have told me she’d be
here. I had time to kill myself.

NATHAN
Just drop it, man. She’s my
girlfriend now and I love her. Get
used to it.

JAMIE
Okay, but if she’s coming to family
Thanksgiving, next thing she’s
gonna expect is a proposal. Get
used to that.

INT. BROWN DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Ingrid holds up a spoon of rice with red berries.

INGRID
And it’s really called “barbarian
stew?”

NATHAN’S MOM
No, those are “bar-berries.” The
dish is Zereshk Pollo. It’s
Persian, from my mother’s side.

INGRID
Ha ahhaa. It is so good. Spicy!
Nathan and Jaime come back in.

JAIME
So, Ingrid, Nathan says you invited
him to your grandma’s 100th
birthday?

NATHAN’S DAD
A hundred! Wow, impressive.

INGRID
Well, she’s in Heaven.

NATHAN’S MOM
Oh, which one?

INGRID
Lakeview.

NATHAN’S MOM
Mmm, I’ve heard it’s beautiful.

INGRID
Well, we’re an Amazon family.
Prime on both sides.

NATHAN’S DAD
Heaven's too expensive for me.
I'll be stored on a sim card until
these two finish their free
version.

JAIME
It won’t be long, if Nathan parties
a little less and programs a little
more.

NATHAN’S MOM
Pay him a salary, you can ask for a
drug test.

NATHAN
Aw yiss, Mom!

INGRID
Well, you’d all be welcome at
Lakeview. It’s surprisingly
affordable.

Awkward beat. Nathan’s niece NEVAEH, 8, whispers in his ear.
NEVAEH

Uncle Nathan, can you help me with
my classical dance homework?
INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Nevaeh is TWERKING happily to “OMG” by Arash as Nathan mimes
riding her like a cowboy.

DANCING MONTAGE: Nathan holds Nevaeh’s hands and spins her
around. He glances in the mirror and fixes his hair. Nevaeh
slips out of his other hand and crashes into the wall.

NEVAEH
Uncle Nathan!

NATHAN
Sorry!

They keep twirling. Nevaeh is red in the face but loving it.
Ingrid watches him dance with a smile, then checks her phone.
She catches Nathan’s eye and makes a “let’s go” face.

INT. AMAZON OFFICE AREA —- BROOKLYN - DAY

Nora walks past rows of desks, puts her coat on her chair,
and touches her ear. A little earbud blinks on and she hears
Beyoncé’s “Crazy in Love.” She waves at her terminal and her
screen lights up.

Across the room, Nora’s supervisor, LUCY, looks at a map of
the workstations. Next to “Nora Antony” is a headset icon.
Lucy pokes it with her finger.

LUCY
No music!
The music stops.
NORA
Cool! Thanks so much, Lucy! Merry

Winterday!

She turns to her screen covered with folders and opens one
labelled “Rechna Futawarab.” Inside is an avatar of a MIDDLE-
AGED INDIAN WOMAN next to a million video files and an alert:
“rendering complete: activate?” Nora hits a key and a window
opens with a jiggling brain wave and an upload circle that
starts filling up.

NORA (CONT'D)
(into her headset)
Hello, Rechna.
(MORE )
NORA (CONT'D)
I’m not expecting you to answer me
yet, the system is sorting through
a lot of information right now, but
I’m gonna count to three, try to

count with me. One... two... three.

RECHNA (V.O.)
(moaning)
Oo-oh my God, where am I...?

NORA (0.S.)
It’s all good, Rechna. Welcome to
Heaven.

INT. A BED SOMEWHERE - NIGHT - LATER
Nathan and Ingrid finish making love, and she snuggles into

him. Passing lights and advertising flicker on the ceiling.
REVEAL the bed is in Ingrid’s CAR.

INGRID
Think they liked me?
NATHAN
Sure. You’re so fucking hot.
INGRID
What?
NATHAN

Sorry, what'd you say?

INGRID
Your family. Your mom said I was
the first girl you ever brought
home for Thanksgiving.

NATHAN
No big deal.

INGRID
I think it is a big deal. I feel
very special, babe.

NATHAN
++. Cool.

HONK!! The car swerves, people outside curse, Nathan sits up.
NATHAN (CONT'D)

Whoa, do you have “prioritize
occupant” on?
10.

INGRID
Of course. I care about us. You
don't “prioritize pedestrian,” do
you?
He does. Ingrid notices something outside.
INGRID (CONT'D)
Park!
INT./EXT. INGRID’S CAR POD - CONTINUOUS

Ingrid’s car pulls over across from a little bodega called

“Whole Foods.” (For some reason, that chain has shrunk in
the future.) Behind them, Nathan’s empty car pulls over too.
INGRID
Sleep over tonight?
NATHAN
Uh...
INGRID

(sexy)
I‘1l make it worth your while in
the morning.

NATHAN
Okay.

INGRID
Good. We need egg powder and a can
of toast.

EXT. INGRID’S CAR POD — CONTINUOUS

Nathan enters the store. Her pod takes off, his waits.

INT. WHOLE FOODS - FREEZER AISLE - NIGHT
Nathan pushes a cart down the freezer aisle.
FREEZER
(Australian accent)
You lack iron. Buy some spinach.

INT. WHOLE FOODS - CHECK OUT - A LITTLE LATER

A robot arm bags his groceries. Nathan pages through a
tabloid on a screen.
11.

CLOSE ON - TABLOID ARTICLE

“Facebook/Panera Heaven Breaks First Weekend Attendance
Records.” Videos show a Morongo-style hotel, with crowds
gambling, learning to sexy dance, etc.

INT. NATHAN’S CAR - SPEEDING - LATER
PULL OUT to see the article is now on Nathan’s windshield.

REPORTER (V.O.)

Panera went online with a record-
breaking fifty million unique souls
and visitors. The aggressive
former-chain restaurant is on an
acquisition tear, its stock soaring
after rolling up Monsanto and
Facebook earlier this year.

Nathan suddenly notices his car is going fast and is HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR a double-parked truck.

NATHAN
Car, see the parked truck?
CAR
No.
NATHAN
Yeah, it’s double parked.
CAR
Data shows no vehicles.
NATHAN
I’m looking right at a truck!
CAR
Could you be impaired by drugs?
Again?
NATHAN

Fuck you! Manual override!

CAR
Manuel? There is no Manuel here.
You are probably impaired.

NATHAN
STOP THE CAR!

Nathan CRASHES into the truck.
12.

INT. NORA’S WORKSTATION - BROOKLYN - DAY

Nora sucks an iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts, and works on a
new folder on her screen labelled “NATHAN BROWN.”

She opens a video memory file to see...

Nathan's POV: he happily dances with Nevaeh at Thanksgiving.
Nathan catches sight of himself in the mirror and grins.

Nora pauses the image, then screenshots Nathan’s face and
drags it to an empty wire frame animation, giving it a blurry
Nathan face.

Lucy walks down the line of desks.

LUCY
Anyone see my coffee order?

Nora rotates her cup which says “Lucy” away as Lucy passes.

NORA
Nope.

She opens another memory file.

Nathan's POV: the Pacific Coast Highway over the top of
motorcycle handlebars, ocean on the left. Nathan looks into
the side mirror and grins, the wind whipping his hair.

Nora pauses the picture of Nathan checking his look in the
mirror again. This guy just loves himself, doesn't he? She
drags the image to the wire-frame avatar, which gets more
detailed and high-res.

FEMALE CO-WORKER (0.S.)
Ooh, young.

A female co-worker looks over Nora’s shoulder.

FEMALE CO-WORKER (CONT’D)
And cute.

NORA
He sure thinks he’s cute. Basic
Beverly Hills douche. App start-
up? Vintage motorcycle? Come on.

FEMALE CO-WORKER
I didn’t say have his baby, I'd
just dance that pole. I’m in the
wrong neighborhood -- my Nitely
fucks all have less muscles and
body hair than me... How’d he die?
13.

NORA
(looks at file)
Car accident.

FEMALE CO-WORKER
You mean motorcycle?

NORA
It says car.

FEMALE CO-WORKER
Weird. I’m Uploading my fifth old
woman in a row. Fun, huh?

LATER

Nora carefully edits Nathan’s hair on the avatar she is
building, which is very detailed now. Using a stylus, she
smooths out a cowlick. Perfect. She is very good at what
she does. She looks at his handsome face for a beat, then
mischievously “undos” the last few strokes until the cowlick
is back, and saves her work.

She clicks on another memory file, but it doesn’t open.
“MEMORY FILE A56F432C8 DAMAGED.” Nora frowns. That usually
doesn't happen. She starts a folder labelled “???” and drags
the damaged file into it. She opens the next memory file.
Nathan’s POV: lights pass by on a ceiling.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER THE ACCIDENT

Chaos. Nathan is on a gurney being pushed into an OR where a
team is working on him. Ingrid follows, freaking out.

ER NURSE
Do you have any drug allergies,
Nathan?
NATHAN
(voice is weird and
whispery)

No. I really think I’m okay.

ER NURSE
When’s your birthday?

NATHAN
On the brif of Febinary.
14.

INGRID
Oh, you’re not okay. God, I should
have waited for you!

NATHAN
-.. Your teeth are so white.

ER NURSE
Morphine has kicked in.

NATHAN
I’m going home.

Nathan tries to stand up.

BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE
(another Australian female
voice)
Sit down please.

ANOTHER ER NURSE
His vitals are dropping.

ER NURSE
5 mgs epinephrine NOW.

INGRID
Oh! We really want to Upload and I
don’t want to miss the window.

ER NURSE
Is the paperwork all filled out?
INGRID
No.
ER NURSE
Heaven sales rep to the ER.
NATHAN
Wait, what?
ER NURSE ANOTHER ER NURSE
Just in case. Can't Upload a dead body.

NATHAN (CONT'D)
Dead body?! I’m going to be fine.

INGRID
Baby there's pieces of you sticking
out all over the place!

NATHAN ANOTHER ER NURSE
Could someone call my folks? Vitals still dropping.
15.

INGRID ER NURSE
They're on their way. Your Where is my surgical
car called them after me. consult!?

A man in a suit steps in holding a tablet.

HEAVEN SALES REP
Brand?

INGRID
Amazon Lakeview please.

NATHAN
I want to request Neutral Storage,
it’s a separate form.

HEAVEN SALES REP
Sorry. One at a time please. I
need to start with an Amazon ID.

INGRID
Ingrid Kannerman. Capital P
panorama ampersand 2002.

ER NURSE
Stand by on Upload Room 2.

NATHAN
Really don’t think we need Upload.
I'm feeling pretty chill.

INSERT SHOT: his vital signs dropping on the monitor.

ANOTHER ER NURSE ER NURSE

down. I’ve got OR 3 on hold also.
Where is my consult?!?

INGRID
Baby, don’t try and tough this out.
You could just old-fashioned die,
or we could be together forever.

NATHAN
Forever? Um. Honey you know I
love you, you're amazing, but--

INGRID
But what?

Ingrid starts CRYING.
16.

INGRID (CONT'D)
If you’d rather die than be with me-
- I just -- I --

NATHAN
Don’t cry. Please don’t cry.

Ingrid cries harder. Nathan is aware of the sales rep.

Me too!

NATHAN (CONT'D)

There’s people... Now is so...
(sigh)

Of course I want to be with you,

INGRID NATHAN
there’s just a lot going on--

HEAVEN SALES REP
(thrusting tablet under
Nathan’s hand)

Great. Hit “accept.”

NATHAN
Wait, what am I accepting?

HEAVEN SALES REP
Our terms of service.

NATHAN
Which are?

HEAVEN SALES REP
You want to read it? It’s like two
hundred pages.

NATHAN
I can’t sign without knowing what
I'm signing.

HEAVEN SALES REP
Have you never gotten an app, ever?
You can’t use the service without
agreeing to the terms of service.

NATHAN
But that’s not fair. If I don’t
use the service, I could be dead.
I mean really dead dead.
(it hits him)
Disappear forever dead.

HEAVEN SALES REP
I would choose “agree” then.
17.

NATHAN
Fuuuuuuuck.

INT. NORA’S WORKSTATION - BROOKLYN - DAY

Nora watches the memory unfold with interest, loudly sucking
her drink down to the ice.

BACK TO SCENE

NATHAN
(to ER nurse)
What are my chances here?

ER NURSE
Your vitals keep dropping so unless
your system rallies, you are
currently dying of a punctured
lung. I’m sorry.

NATHAN
This is insane, I’m only 27!

They stop pushing the gurney because the hall splits into two
directions: left to Operating Rooms 1-4 and right to Upload
Rooms 1-3.

ER NURSE
What do you want to do?

INGRID
Sign the thing!

Nathan motions to the Heaven Sales Rep to lean in.

NATHAN
There’s still sex, right?

HEAVEN SALES REP
Oh yeah. The VR suits are amazing.
You can adjust her avatar, you can
boost levels, stimulation you
wouldn’t believe.

Nathan nods and looks around.
NATHAN
Where’s my mom? I need to talk to
her.

HEAVEN SALES REP
Eww gross.
18.
NATHAN
Not about that. God.

His monitor beeps another warning. Ingrid gets on her knees
and holds his hand like a demented proposal.

INGRID
Nathan please. Say yes. I’m
begging you, we’re out of time.

NATHAN
Ugh. Okay. Okay!

He touches “ACCEPT” and they wheel him to the right.

INGRID NATHAN
This is going to be so great! Okay. Whatever.
(overwhelmed)

It’s only for eternity.

INT. UPLOAD ROOM 2 - MOMENTS LATER

Nathan is strapped in a chair under a giant device that hangs
from the ceiling.

SCANNING TECHNICIAN
This won't hurt. As soon as the
shutters are up to speed, the
scanner will start recording. I’m
jealous man, Lakeview’s plush. See
you on the other side.

He exits. (ANGLE ON THE MONITOR: Unnoticed, Nathan’s VITAL
SIGNS start to GO BACK UP.)

Nathan looks above him where a metal blade is starting to
spin faster and faster.

NATHAN
(scared)
Uh... Can we hit pause here?

SCANNING TECHNICIAN (V.O.)
Please look forward at the spot in
front of you.

Nathan looks at a “LOOK HERE” sign on the wall next to the
window where Ingrid and the nurses are watching him. Through
the window, he sees his mom burst in the back of the room.

NATHAN
Oh thank God. Mom--
19.

Suddenly the Scan begins. A blinding WHITE LIGHT shines down
on Nathan’s head, burning off one layer of molecules at a
time, as a fan blows the ash of the already recorded layer
out of the way.

Quickly, Nathan’s HEAD FIZZLES down to his shoulders like a
burnt hair and the machine shuts off.

His headless body, still with arm raised to his mom, falls
into a cooler full of ice. As his mom and Ingrid SCREAM...

SCANNING MACHINE
(Australian accent)
Upload complete.

FADE TO BLACK
After a time...

NORA (V.O.)
Hello, Nathan. I’m not expecting
you to answer me yet, the system is
sorting through a lot of
information, but I’m going to count
to three, and try to count with me.
One... two... three...

INT. NORA’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Nora looks at a wave form of Nathan’s consciousness. Next to
it is a circle that is slowly filling up. (Another window
scrolls through the millions of video files and photos. It’s
complicated and cool as shit.)

NORA
Welcome to Heaven, Nathan.

BACK TO BLACK

NORA (V.O.)
You made it to Lakeview, you lucky
duck.
NATHAN (V.O.)
(groans)
NORA (V.O.)

Hang in there, dude.
20.

INT. NORA’S WORKSTATION —- CONTINUOUS
Nora’s screen has Nathan’s brainwaves playing in a window.

NORA
I want you to think of your self.
The “I” in the sentence, “I think
therefore I am.” Okay, cool, just
gonna grab that...

She highlights a section of his waveform with her cursor.

NORA (CONT'D)
That’1l be your password, or
passthought. I’11 always be able
to use this to--

BACK TO DARKNESS

NORA (V.O.)
recognize you. Now, remember
kindergarten? The alphabet song, A
BCD? Think that for me... Yeah,
good. Now think the color blue...
white... red... yellow. Perfect.

The darkness goes blue, then white, then red, then yellow,
then starts resolving slowly into a scene.

INT. NORA’S WORKSTATION —- CONTINUOUS
Nora looks at the screen.

NATHAN (V.O.)
(Australian female)
I’m feeling pins and needles.

NORA
(laughs )
Why do people always set it for
Australian accent? Say again
please.

She adjusts some stuff on the screen.

NATHAN (V.O.)
(regular voice)
Pins and needles.

NORA
There we go. That’s a lot better
voice for you.
21.

NATHAN (V.O.)
Yours is nice too.

Nora rolls her eyes and ignores that.

NORA
Pins and needles is just the
program finding your nerve endings.
Can you see anything?

INT. AMAZON LAKEVIEW — CONTINUOUS

The place is booting up -- a rectangle becomes a window.
Details emerge: a wooden rocking chair, a crocheted cushion,
porcelain door knobs. Out the window, brilliant blue sky,
dark green fir trees on a distant mountain.

NATHAN (0.S.)
I’m in some kind of old-fashioned
room...

Nathan’s voice comes out of a simple male avatar with brown
skin and hair, whose details are quickly getting filled in.
He looks out the window...

NATHAN (CONT'D)
.--looking over a lake...

Aaaannnd, he is completely detailed and HD.

NATHAN (CONT'D)
..-beautiful trees... And, whoa! A
shark swimming right towards me!

NORA (V.O.)
What?! That’s not supposed to--

NATHAN
JK.

INTERCUT BETWEEN NATHAN AND NORA

NORA

(a little impressed)
Ha! Sense of humor. Nice. Um, so,
welcome to Amazon's Lakeview. The
only digital afterlife environment
modeled on the grand Victorian
hotels of the United States and
Canada.
22.

Nathan looks around the room -- a big, luxurious, hotel suite
with a stuffed moose head and handmade wooden chairs with the
bark still on.

NORA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Hope it’s not too specific for you.

NATHAN
It was never my thing, but it’s
kinda cool.

NORA
Yeah, our design team is brilliant.
They took for inspiration the
vacation spots of the Gilded Age
millionaires, with a little Gatsby
and Niagara Falls thrown in for
fun. Timeless Americana, uplifting
views, healthy pursuits. Good
stuff.

NATHAN
Are there slaves?

NORA
What?! This is a design scheme,
one, and that’s not even the right
period, two. Lakeview is open to
all races, religions, genders,
absolutely anybody. I see you
selected “non-denominational
charismatic Christian” as your
creed. That means, for you, the
little chapel east of the hotel
will be a Pentecostal Church. For
someone else, the same building
could be a mosque or even a bowling
alley.

NATHAN
I’1l take the bowling alley.

NORA
I can make that change if you give
me your Amazon ID.

NATHAN
BrunoMelrosel18.
23.

NORA
(typing)
Your first dog and the street you
grew up -- you used your porn name

for an Amazon ID? Pretty poor
security for a coder.

NATHAN
Excuse me?

NORA
Didn't work. Your charges are
going to an Ingrid Kannerman.

NATHAN
Oh yeah.

NORA
There’re lots of free activities.
Swim in the lake, hike up to a
gazebo, take a class.

Nathan’s face suddenly screws up and he chokes back tears.

NORA (CONT'D)
Uh oh. Dude, you okay?

NATHAN
(tearful)
Yeah. I don’t know. No.

NORA
Don’t be embarrassed. It must be
really hard. To die, I mean.
Especially when you’re young, and
handss - um, healthy. And
remember, they saved your body so
who knows? Maybe one day they
figure out how to put you back in.

Nora watches with compassion as Nathan sucks it back up and
composes himself.

NATHAN
Thanks. What’s your name?

NORA
Well, you’re supposed to just refer
to me as your “Angel.”

NATHAN
Oh. Are you dead too, or alive?
Or just artificial intelligence?
24.

NORA
I’m not allowed to say. Sorry.
But anytime you need me I’1l be
here for you. Just ask and I'll be
right in your ear.

NATHAN
Okay... Angel.

Nora, privately, realizes she likes having this handsome guy
call her “angel.” Before the pause turns into a moment...

NORA
(back on script)
So you’re all connected now. Do
you look real to yourself? Ten
fingers and toes?

He wiggles them.

NATHAN
Yeah, pretty seamless.

NORA
Explore, enjoy, meet your fellow
Uploads. This is the first day of
the rest of your afterlife.

NATHAN
Got it. OK. Sounds good.

He gives a brave thumbs up. Nora touches her screen and is
suddenly looking at 48 little windows with other clients in
them. She takes off her headset and rubs her temples. She
finds she is still watching Nathan in his small window.

She watches as he goes to the window, closes the shades and
curls up in bed. Wait, is he crying?

She touches the screen to make it go full screen again, and
watches Nathan grieve.

NORA
(gently)
Hey, this was a big day. You died
and were reborn, so a lot to
process.

NATHAN
Yeah.

NORA
Tomorrow’ll be better, you’ll see.
Get some rest.
25.

NATHAN
Ugh, there’s no way I’m going to
fall asl--
Nora drags down a setting bar on her screen and Nathan is
instantly asleep. She watches him for a beat, then types
something on her keyboard, and a blanket covers him.
INT. NATHAN’S SUITE - LAKEVIEW - NEXT MORNING
Nathan wakes up, sunshine streaming in his window. He
stretches and looks around. Not terrible.
INT. NATHAN’S BATHROOM
He takes a long shower with great water pressure.
NATHAN
Oh yiss! Oh my god, yes!!
INT. NATHAN’S BATHROOM - LATER

Nathan combs his hair but can’t get rid of the cowlick.

INT. NATHAN’S SUITE - KITCHENETTE - CONTINUOUS

He walks into a kitchenette and opens the fridge.

NATHAN’S POV

The fridge is only stocked with drinks. A sign appears in the
air: “swipe left.” He swipes and the drinks slide away,
revealing a fridge interior full of fruit. He swipes a
couple more times until he sees a bunch of hot coffees. He
tries to take out a coffee cup of steaming hot coffee.

Another sign appears in the air: “IN-APP PURCHASE. Enter
your Amazon ID and you will be charged $1.99.”

NATHAN
Angel?

MALE ANGEL (0.S.)
Yes, Nathan?

Nathan jumps. Behind him is a STUDLY MAN WITH ANGEL WINGS.

NATHAN
Yo, what the--? where did you--?
26.

MALE ANGEL
Ha ha ha. Don’t freak.
INT. AMAZON CALL CENTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The Male Angel, a much shlubbier guy in real life, sits at
his work station, with a Virtual Reality box on his face.

MALE ANGEL

It’s just VR so I can visit in
person. You good?

INT. NATHAN’S SUITE - CONTINUOUS

NATHAN
What happened to the one from last
night?

MALE ANGEL

Not her shift yet. Want a coffee?
NATHAN
Maybe something stronger. Genie, a
Moscow Mule please.
MALE ANGEL
Ha ha ha. But really, we have them
on screen 27.

NATHAN
.-. Nah. It’s okay.

MALE ANGEL
No problem. Later gater.

He disappears. How weird.

EXT. NATHAN’S BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

Nathan goes out on the balcony and sees a BEAUTIFUL LAKE with
pine-clad mountains across the water.

A couple (ZACH and BARBARA) sit holding hands in Adirondack
chairs on the balcony next to his.

ZACH
Hey newbie.

NATHAN
Hey.
27.

BARBARA
Settling in okay?

NATHAN
Yeah. Are you both...?

BARBARA
Dead? Yup. But thank God we both
had time for Upload.

ZACH
High school sweethearts. First
woman I ever kissed.

NATHAN
Aww, soulmates. That’s awesome.

ZACH
That’s what it’s all about. Love
beats death, two zip.

NATHAN
Cute. So, Upload, huh?
(slaps his chest, deep
breath)
I feel completely real and alive.
The programming depth is insane.
And I’m a coder.

BARBARA
Oh, what do you program?

NATHAN
(trying to remember)
Uh... different things.

ZACH
Good! Gonna go for a hike?

NATHAN
Maybe after breakfast. If I don’t
want to use the minibar, is there a
breakfast that’s included, or...?

BARBARA
Yes, in the dining hall, for
another 20 minutes. It’s amazing.
They’ve got maple bacon donuts.

NATHAN
D’oh! Right?
(off their stare)
Simpsons?
(mutters to himself)
(MORE )
NATHAN (CONT'D)
It’s only been on the air for 57
years.

INT. LAKEVIEW - HALL.

28.

Nathan goes out his front door (Suite 10556) and is in a long
hall. He walks past other doors looking for the elevators.

INT. LAKEVIEW —- ELEVATOR

He gets on an elevator with a woman who looks 18, but wears

clothes from the 1960s, and is only in black-and-white.

stares at her...

1960S WOMAN
Can I help you?

NATHAN
Sorry. This is my first day.

1960S WOMAN
Oh! You’re wondering about my
avatar. I turn a hundred next
month, but I used a photo of me
from 1961, although it might be my

sister.

NATHAN
Is your last name Kannerman by any
chance?

1960S WOMAN

Yes it is. Mildred Kannerman.

NATHAN
I’m going to your birthday party.
I’m Ingrid’s boyfriend.

MILDRED
Oh, honey, I hadn’t heard. I’m so
sorry. Oh, poor Ingrid. This is
really too bad.

The elevator stops at her floor.
MILDRED (CONT'D)
That’s me. 10,300.
(she stares at him)
This is really too bad.

She gets off, leaving him a bit thrown.

He
29.

INT. LAKEVIEW - FIRST FLOOR

Nathan walks past a CONCIERGE DESK with a line of people. A
GUY WITH A CHEERFUL GRIN (DAN) is offering them GUM.

DAN THE ORBIT GUM GUY
Gum? Orbit Gum? Piece of gum?
Piece of Orbit Spearmint gum?
Sugar free? Piece of Orbit’s new
Wintergreen Wonderland flavor-fixed
gum with healthy Sorbitol?

People scowl and push him out of the way. A guy takes a
piece and “0.75” floats over his head and evaporates.

Nathan follows a sign for “Dining Hall.” He opens his
fingers and his screen appears.

NATHAN
Ingrid.

Facetime request connects. (Nathan talks as he walks through
the public areas of Lakeview.) Ingrid looks flushed and
dressed up, a lot of people behind her.

INGRID
Yes!! Hi there! How's it going?

NATHAN
(thrown)
Uh, it’s okay. Where'd I get you?

INGRID
At a friend’s. So? Is it amazing?
Do you feel like yourself? Was it
scary? Do you love it?

NATHAN
Yeah, it’s really cool. I mean,
I'd rather be alive, obviously. I
met your grandma.

INGRID
I know! She texted me. She said
you were cute but a little lost.

NATHAN
Both true.
(beat)
I miss you.
30.

INGRID
Yeah. I miss you too. Everybody's
been all, I’m so sorry your
boyfriend died. I miss your body.

NATHAN
Aww. I miss my hair. There’s
something off about my hair now.

INGRID
Yeah, looks different. Hair is
probably hard to program.

NATHAN
Tell me about it.

They look at each other awkwardly.

NATHAN (CONT'D)
Is this weird?

INGRID
We'll get used to it.

NATHAN
Pretend I’m on a business trip.

INGRID
For the next 50 years until I can
join you. 60 if I eat right.

NATHAN
Then don’t.

INGRID
I had ice cream for breakfast.

NATHAN
That’s so hot. Hey, so can I get
your Amazon password? I can’t
charge anything to my account here.

INGRID
Yeah, we used my account in the ER.

NATHAN
I guess I need your password then.

INGRID
Well, I set something up where I
get a text alert when you want to
charge something. I like knowing
what you’re up to.

(MORE )
31.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Makes me feel closer to you. Hey!
Show me the lake!

Nathan points his screen towards the window across the porch.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Fucking gorgeous, babe!

WOMAN (0.S.
Ing! Ohmygod, I’m so sorry!

INGRID
(turns to someone
offscreen)
Theng you! Ohmigod, I probably look
like a fucking wreck right now,
it’s been so difficult--

WOMAN (0.S.
No you look strong like a goddess,
like a hot survivor.

INGRID
Theng you!
(whispering to Nathan)
Baby, I ran into my pube stylist,
I gotta drone.

NATHAN
But you don’t have any pubes.
INGRID
I know, she’s amazing. I/’11 call
you later. If you need anything I
am here for you. Utterly. Love
you.

NATHAN
Love you too.
CLOSE UP OF FRAMED PHOTO

Nora in a graduation gown between her smiling parents.

INT. DAVE ANTONY’S HOUSE - CITY ISLAND - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

Nora looks at the photo wistfully. In the background, her
Dad, DAVE, is in his kitchen.
32.

DAVE ANTONY
Hope you're hungry! I printed a
steak design Jamie Oliver tweeted
this morning.

A 3D printer finishes two plates of dinner, layer by layer.

DAVE ANTONY (CONT’D)
Oliver’s only on Google/Samsung so
I know you didn’t have this for
lunch.

He brings the food to a table set for two.

NORA
Speaking of work, Dad...

DAVE ANTONY
(cautious)
O-kay.

NORA
We've had a ton of upgrades lately.
With my employee discount, it’d be
smart to lock in such a good deal--

Dave stifles a coughing fit. Nora looks on, concerned.

NORA (CONT'D)
Dad...

After his coughs subside--

DAVE ANTONY
Sorry, honey. No go.

NORA
I could be your angel, we could
hang out--

DAVE ANTONY
I can’t. Mom is waiting for me.

NORA
C'mon! You don’t believe that old
stuff!

DAVE ANTONY
It doesn't make any sense, but it’s
how I feel. How could Heaven not
have your mother in it?

He looks at her with a sad smile. Nora sighs and goes back
to her dinner.
33.

DAVE ANTONY (CONT’D)
How’s the steak?

NORA
I think your fat cartridge might be
low.

DAVE ANTONY
Yeah, it’s terrible.

INT. LAKEVIEW DINING HALL - LATER

The grand dining hall with a view of the lake and mountains
is full of Uploads. A sign says “Breakfast served 6 - 10am.”
Nathan starts loading a plate with treats from the buffet.

NATHAN
Oh my god. This is amazing! Bacon
and Canadian bacon. Chocolate chip
pancakes. Noice!

CULTURED VOICE (V.O.)
Ten o'clock. Breakfast is over.

All the food in the dining hall and on his plate disappears.

NATHAN
What?! Aww!

A disheveled angry guy (LUKE) rushes in and takes in the
emptiness.

LUKE
FUCK! Fuckity fuck fuck fuck.

He heads over to one of those industrial milk dispensers with
rubber tubes coming out the bottom, and opens and slams the
door five times fast. A dinner roll appears in an empty
bread basket. He scarfs the roll then does it again. Nathan
walks over.

NATHAN
Can I try?

Luke nods and Nathan slams the door to get a free roll.

NATHAN (CONT'D)
Useful glitch. I don’t know why
I'm feeling hungry at all, I mean,
there’s no need to eat, right?
34.

LUKE
The first Uploads didn’t shit or
eat, didn’t even have eyelids.
They all went psychotic in a week.

Luke rapidly slams the milk door.

LUKE (CONT'D)
You gotta believe it’s real. When
the weirdness gets in your head,
guys are drawn to the torrent.

He points out the window to the far end of the lake at a

waterfall.

Close up: THE DATA TORRENT. A rushing column of plasma with
steam boiling off it. Oddly beautiful and powerful, like
Niagara Falls.

LUKE (CONT'D)
That’s the data stream between here
and the real world. Poor bastards
jump in to try to get back.

NATHAN
Can they?

LUKE
Nah, they get blown to bits. My
angel has me working on deep
breathing and meditation to keep me
“here and now,” stay connected. Of
course, stuff like hot rolls
magically appearing when you slam a
milk door doesn’t help.

NATHAN
Tasty, though.

They each munch a roll and grin.

NATHAN (CONT'D)
Hey I’m Nathan. This is my first
day.

LUKE
Luke. How'd you buy it?

NATHAN
My self-driving car crashed.

LUKE
Ha! They’re supposed to be
foolproof.
35.

NATHAN
Guess it wasn’t. How about you?

LUKE
Lost my legs in Iran and spent five
years in a wheelchair. Then one
day I wheeled my ass under a
scanner.

NATHAN
(sober )
Oh. Suiscan.

LUKE
Yeah. But look what I’m working
with now!

He does a crazy little jig, gesturing to his legs.

NATHAN
Right on!

INT. MENS ROOM - LATER

Nathan stands in front of a urinal, a stream of pee going in.
Something looks “off” to him. Experimentally, he twists his
pelvis. The pee stream bends in mid air and still ends up
perfectly in the urinal.

NATHAN
Ha ha. Awesome.

QUICK MONTAGE of Nathan peeing sideways, peeing behind
himself, peeing out the window. In all cases, the stream
curves and shoots directly into the urinal.

INT. NORA’S APARTMENT - QUEENS, NY - BATHROOM

Nora’s in the shower, under a horrible low-flo dribble.
MANDI, Nora’s roommate, holds up a fitband that’s on a pile
of Nora’s clothes.

MANDI
Can I check Nitely on your phone?

NORA
Be my guest. I am so done with
that app. Well, almost done.

Mandi snaps the fitband on her wrist and opens her thumb and
finger, making the screen appear. She swipes through Nitely,
looking at profiles.
36.

MANDI
It’s proven to know you better than
you know yourself, they invested a
billion dollars in the algorithm.
(seeing a cool profile)

Ooh, they’re matching you with some
real hotties. I get nothing but
bus boys and meth addicts.

NORA
I thought you said the algorithm
was good.
MANDI
Yeah, I deserve a meth addict.
NORA
Oh Mandi.
MANDI

Ah, he was fun, he was up for
anything. And the lack of teeth
proved to be pretty bomb actually.
He gummed me until I screamed.

EXT. LAKEVIEW - DAY

Nathan goes for a hike around the lake. It is really
beautiful. He smiles at other scans as he walks.

NATHAN
Morning! Good day!

EXT. LAKE - A LITTLE LATER

He comes upon a resort map on a signpost. Next to it, LOUIE
CRUZ, fat, 40s, is talking into an Ansel Adams-style box
camera on a tripod.

LOUIE CRUZ
Hey guys, its Lou Crayz, whassup?
Coming at you live from Lakeview.
So... I really like this view of
the lake, it’s one of my faves.
They’ve spent beaucoup bucks on
getting the view absolutely right.
It’s Lakey as hell. The waterfeel
is more meh. Kind of grainy, and
the sun on the ripples is a
repeating gif but it repeats too
fast to be really mwah! That’s all
for now. Like, comment, subscribe!
37.

Louie starts packing up his camera.

NATHAN
Hey I’ve seen the ads for a
Lakeview V-cation, where is
everybody? I thought this was a
super popular place for Weekend
Gigaways.

LOUIE CRUZ
They’re all here. You only see 5
floors at a time. Like what is
your suite number?

NATHAN
10556.

LOUIE CRUZ
OK, you’re on the ten thousand five
hundredth floor. Living people on
V-cation are floors 1 to 5,000. You
don’t want to go down there, it
smells like a Senor Frog's.
Everything over 5,000 is Heaven,
permanent residents.

He pinches the resort map and expands the picture of the
hotel. It stretches 10,000 floors into the sky.

LOUIE CRUZ (CONT’D)
We all use the same map. There’s
millions of people swimming in the
pool right now. You can tell cause
the frame rate drops.

He points to a guy diving off the diving board. The guy
enters the water in jerky increments.

NATHAN
Whoa.

INT. NORA’S TINY APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a Kindle-like device with a “Queens Public Library”
bar code. REVEAL it’s connected to a VR headset that Nora
wears, sitting up in bed.

IN NORA’S VIRTUAL REALITY - HAWAII, 2004 - CONTINUOUS

A scene from the Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore romantic comedy
50 First Dates, only Drew Barrymore has been removed and Nora
is in the film, walking to her car with young Adam Sandler
after eating breakfast. They are both being very flirty.

 

 
38.

ADAM SANDLER
And the real cool thing about
walruses is they’re very
mysterious.

NORA
Mysterious?

ADAM SANDLER
Yeah, yeah, we really don’t know
what they’re like in the wild.

NORA
They don’t just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time?

ADAM SANDLER
Yeah that’s all we really see that
they do outside of the water. There
hasn’t been much research on what
they do under the ice, which is
where they spend two thirds of
their lives.

NORA
Well maybe they’re just down there
intimidating the other sea
creatures with their big winkies.

ADAM SANDLER
That is one theory.

They both laugh.

INT. NORA’S TINY APARTMENT —- CONTINUOUS

Nora sits alone in her bed lost in VR. Reveal on the other
side of the room: Mandi is having LOUD SEX with some scrawny
dude with bad teeth.

EXT. LAKEVIEW - HEDGE - LATER
Nathan walks up to a magnificent tree next to a hedge. He
pulls off a few leaves and looks at them. They are all
copies of the same leaf.
NATHAN
(disappointed)

Hmm. Cut and paste.

Suddenly a tennis ball flies over the top.
39.

DYLAN (V.0.)
Ball!

Nathan picks it up and looks over the hedge.

NATHAN’S POV

An 11-year-old boy, DYLAN MCNAB, sits in the middle of A GREY
VOID. The hedge was the border of what was programmed, and
past it is... nothing.

NATHAN
Agh! Get down from there!

DYLAN
Calm down. It’s okay.

Nathan gingerly climbs over and slides to Dylan like a guy
walking on thin ice. Dylan takes the ball and begins
bouncing it against the back of the hedge and catching it.

Nathan looks down into the void, then back at Lakeview.

NATHAN
This is fucking weird.

DYLAN
It’s nice. Like being nowhere.
Sometimes I can’t take it anymore,
you know?

NATHAN
Are your parents here too?

DYLAN
No, I fell off a cliff at the Grand
Canyon. My mom says I was a
handful.
(squints at Nathan's hair)
Are you wearing a wig?

NATHAN
(self-consciously running
fingers through hair)
No. God, no. This isn’t my normal
hair. They like programmed it
really wavy or something. It’s
driving me nuts.

DYLAN
Yeah, well--
40.

NATHAN
At home I used a Natural Sculpting
Creme and an anti-frizz Pomade, but
here...
(shrugs )
You're at their mercy, I guess.

DYLAN
Well, that’s--

NATHAN
Pff. Wig! Kid, you’re hilarious!

INT. AMAZON LAKEVIEW OFFICES - BROOKLYN - EVENING

Nora gets out of the elevator with her messenger bag. The
schlubby male angel, IVAN, is getting on to leave.

IVAN
Hey.

Nora nods hello. Ivan wedges his foot in the elevator door.

IVAN (CONT’D)
Hey, I got a friend who’s having a
party in a sick loft Friday night.
He’s got about a thousand Fentanyl.
I've seen ‘em.

NORA
Yeah, no that’s not for me.

IVAN
You should go out sometime. Get
fucked up, have some fun.

NORA
I go out plenty. Just not gonna be
tripping with you in some loft.
I’m not there yet.

IVAN
Too good for that huh? Don’t wait
too long. This offer isn’t open
forever.

He lets the doors close.
41.

INT. NATHAN’S BEDROOM - LAKEVIEW LATER

Nathan picks up a remote and browses a screen that says
“Entertainment.” He selects “Classic TV” then “Game of
Thrones” and a sign appears: In-App Purchase, $4.99. He
tries “Fargo”: In-App Purchase, $4.99. He selects “2 Broke
Girls: FREE.” He turns it off.

He opens his hand to call Ingrid but it goes straight to
voicemail.

INGRID (V.0.)
Hey it’s Ingrid, I’m either out or
busy right now, but I’1l--
Nathan breaks it off. He starts pacing.
NATHAN

I am so lucky. People save their
whole lives for this.

EXT. NATHAN’S BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

He stands on the balcony taking in the beautiful view and
breathing heavily.

NATHAN
Nngg, nggg, calm down, buddy.

A banner ad appears on a cloud: “You recently searched
‘Fargo: Season One.’ Purchase in HD for $49.99?”

NATHAN (CONT'D)
Nngg, nngg.

INT. NATHAN’S BATHROOM - LAKEVIEW - MOMENTS LATER

He stares at himself in the mirror. He tries to fix the
cowlick, but it bounces back.

NATHAN
It’s all good. Gonna live forever.

He smiles into the mirror. After a beat, he tries to rip the
cowlick out of his head with both hands.
INT. AMAZON OFFICE BUILDING - BATHROOM - BROOKLYN

Nora is in a stall, sitting on the toilet and looking at
memes on her hand-screen.
42.

FEMALE CO-WORKER (0.S.)
Nora, are you in here?

Nora says nothing.

FEMALE CO-WORKER (CONT'D)
Um, your new boy is freaking out.
The hot dude. He’s hiking up near
the torrent.

NORA
Shit. Thanks!

INT. AMAZON OFFICE BUILDING - BROOKLYN

Nora runs to her desk and grabs her VR mask. She glances at
her screen.

NORA
Shit shit.

EXT. LAKEVIEW - DATA TORRENT PATH

Nathan walks towards the waterfall, passing signs “Data
torrent ahead. Do not approach.” and “Avatars, AIs, Uploads
go no further. The data torrent will deliminate you into
undifferentiated data bits.” Nora appears behind him.

NORA
Hey, Nathan, wait up!

He recognizes her voice.

NATHAN
Oh, it’s your shift now? You know
you work for a really fucked up
thing. This is a bad idea. The
ads make it look great, but it’s
fucking... monstrous.

NORA
So maybe not the best first day.

NATHAN

Day? There’s no day, there’s no
night, there’s no dirt, there’s no
rain, there’re no bad smells. I
farted, which is already like, why?
just a weird detail, and it was
like someone spritzed the room with
cologne.
43.

NORA
It’s supposed to be Heaven.

NATHAN
How is that Heaven?

NORA
Well, maybe not for you, but if you
were stuck in an elevator with
another guest...

NATHAN
Uh huh. I just want to look over
the edge there. Maybe I can see
home.

NORA
You realize if you jump into that
thing, you don’t go anywhere, you
just disappear. And there’s
nothing left to rescan.

NATHAN
Maybe that’s just my tough luck,
but it’s how it’s supposed to go

down.

NORA
Oo-oh. So you agree with Neil
Beagley.

NATHAN

Who’s that?

NORA
He was a 16 year old boy who died
of a uti ‘cause he refused medical
treatment for religious reasons.
Or the parents of Wesley Parker who
let him die age 11 while they sang
hymns instead of giving him
insulin. You agree with them?

NATHAN
No, that’s fucked up.
NORA
Exactly.
NATHAN

But I did die.
44,

NORA
What was the first thing I asked
you to think of?

NATHAN
My a-b-c’s?

NORA
No, your self. I think therefore I
am. That is still you, it has
always been you, it will always be
you as long as it can still be
aware of itself. That’s
consciousness and that’s what we’re
in the business of keeping going.
Why do you think it’s sometimes
weird and unnatural here? Because
your consciousness is thinking and
comparing with your memories --
that’s you, baby. Doing what you
you always did. Thinking and being
alive. And I’m sure there are
plenty of people, including me for
one, that are glad you're still
here.

NATHAN
You don’t even know me.

NORA
Not yet. But I’d like to. And I
get this isn’t perfect, and maybe
you were led to believe it would be
since the marketing mentions Heaven
like a dozen times, but it’s kind
of better isn’t it? Maybe the
imperfections make it more like
Life, ‘cause Life isn’t perfect,
but Life is the most magical gift
there is. If there’s God, he’s
amazing because he gave us Life,
and the gratitude and creativity to
keep it going as long as we
possibly can.

NATHAN
(beat)
You’re good.

NORA
Yeah.
45.

NATHAN
(examines her)

You're a living person. AI doesn’t
talk like that, with passion and...
pain. Soul. Something’s going on
with you, in your life. This isn’t
just about one of your clients.
This is about you, saving people.

NORA
Maybe.

NATHAN
Is this what you look like for
real? You’re not an old woman or a
dude or something?

NORA

This is me.

(suddenly self conscious)
I mean, my avatar has make-up on
and my hair is nice, and I’m not in
sweatpants, so it’s a little better
than normal, but nothing else is
tweaked.

NATHAN
Good for you then.
(matter of fact)
You're really pretty.

Nora takes this in.

NATHAN (CONT'D)
But I’m not allowed to know your
name.

NORA
No. I could get in trouble. It’s
a policy.

NATHAN
(disappointed)
Okay.

Nora makes a decision.

NORA
My name is Nora. I live in Ozone
Park, Queens. My apartment’s about
as big as your bathroom, but I’m at
work now which is in Dumbo,
Brooklyn.

(MORE )
46.

NORA (CONT'D)
It’s a really humid day and the
bitch a couple desks down is taking
forever to eat a tuna sandwich that
I’m considering chucking out the
window. Nora Antony.

NATHAN
Nice to meet you.

NORA
Likewise. Can we go home now?

NATHAN
Okay.

They start to walk down the path back to the hotel. We see
them from behind. After a beat...

NORA
What’s your favorite smell?

NATHAN
I don’t know. Fresh baked bread,
right out of the oven?

They walk for another couple steps, then Nora shakes her leg
out and farts at him.

NATHAN (CONT'D)
Eww, you weirdo.

NORA
Smell it.

He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and smiles.

NATHAN
Mmmmmm. You genius.
