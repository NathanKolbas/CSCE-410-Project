FADE IN:

EXT. PERTH CITY - SUNRISE.
The city skyline in glorious black and white.

BASIL (V.O.)
Uh ... Sometimes I feel as isolated as
the city in which I live. There’s so
much loneliness, heartache, despair

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY.

BASIL, thirty, bespectacled and scruffy, is slumped ina
chair. SEYMOUR, a decrepit, eighty-year-old shrink, sits
nearby. He’s barely conscious.

BASIL
disappointment, broken dreams,
emptiness, futility.

A long pause. Seymour summons all his strength to speak.
SEYMOUR
We all. Have turning points. In our
lives.

Seymour catches his breath. Basil looks confused.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY.
Commuters board.

BASIL (V.O.)
“We all have turning points in our
lives”? A hundred and seventy seven
dollars just for that? Who does he
think he is? The guy wouldn’t look
out-of-place in a morgue.

INT. TRAIN - DAY.

Basil sits on his own, looking lost.
BASIL (V.O.)
I didn’t have turning points in my

life. It was just one long, continuous,
unrelenting ... grind.
EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY.

A bell sounds, a light flashes, the tracks move. The
oncoming train is diverted from one line to another.

BASIL (V.O.)
And then everything changed.

INT. CRAMPED OFFICE - DAY.
Basil sits at a computer, his eyes glued to the screen.

BASIL (V.O.)
My favourite pornstar had put on an
excessive amount of weight overnight.
She was barely recognisable.

His eyes widen and mouth drops open in shock.

BASIL (V.O.)
One moment, she’s a spirited nymph,
casually committing the most sacred of
human acts for the world to see. Next,
she’s a freak show curiosity confined to
“More Cushion for the Pushin” dot com.

INT. TRAIN - DAY.
Basil sits on his own, completely bewildered.

BASIL (V.O.)
Her change affected me in a way I
couldn’t fully understand. Never before
did I feel so confident, so focussed.

He sits up straight, smooths his shirt and looks more
determined.

BASIL (V.O.)
Never before did I have so great a sense
of entitlement.
INT. FLORIST'S SHOP - DAY.

MIA, cute, early twenties, works behind the counter.
Basil watches her through the shop window.

BASIL (V.O.)
Her name was Mia. I guess there
wasn't much point in sending her
flowers.
Having served a customer, she returns to a stool and
reads a book titled "History of Ballet” with interest.

INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY.

Basil takes a copy of the same book from a shelf.

BASIL (V.O.)
I'd always considered her out of
my reach. Well ... until now.
INT. FLORIST'S SHOP - DAY.

Basil stands at the counter with a nice arrangement of
flowers. Mia removes a price tag.

MIA
Someone's going to like these!

BASIL
Well, actually I've just broken up
with her. But I want her to know she
was special. I'm not a heartbreaker.

MIA
No, you don't look like one.

Basil stalls, then awkwardly sets the ballet book down on
the counter.

MIA
(broad smile)
I’m reading that book!

BASIL
What a coincidence.
MIA
I love ballet!

BASIL
“The Rake’s Progress” is in town
next week.

MIA
(disappointed)
I know! And it’s sold out

BASIL
You need to find a scalper.

He picks up his flowers, offers a brief smile and
abruptly departs. Mia watches after him.

EXT. FLORIST'S SHOP - DAY.
Basil rounds a corner and dumps the flowers in a bin.

BASIL (V.O.)
Of course, I was the one who needed
to find a scalper. And like all real
men, I loathed the ballet.

INT. CRAMPED OFFICE - DAY.
Back in his office, he studies the book with frustration.

BASIL (V.O.)
Now some might disapprove of me
being so deceptive.

INT. LIVING ROOM, FAMILY HOUSE - FLASHBACK.

An angry MOTHER with a basket of washing confronts a
nervous FATHER. She thrusts a business shirt at him and
points to lipstick on the collar.

BASIL (V.O.)
But I grew up watching my father lie
to my mother. Hey, it worked for him.

He manages to calm her down. A five-year-old Basil,
wearing the same spectacles he has as an adult, looks on.
INT. FLORIST'S SHOP - DAY.

Basil stands with Mia. She has a broom in one hand and a
ticket in the other.

BASIL
Only if you want to. We'd bought
the tickets a month ago, when we were
together.

MIA
(studies ticket)
It's for Valentine's Day.

BASIL
Is that alright?

He waits for what seems like forever.

MIA
Yeah. But I have a friend from Italy
staying with me at the moment. I can
go if you can help find a date for him.
So he's not on his own that night.

BASIL
(smiles)
Sure. Shouldn't be a problem.

EXT. BEAT - DAY.

Basil nervously walks through a seedy alley and down
stairs that lead beneath street level.

BASIL (V.O.)
So I thought. Until she told me her
friend was looking for a man's man with
an interest in S&M.

INT. BEAT - DAY.

Basil stands amongst half a dozen muscular men, all in
tight leather clothing. They tower over him.

BASIL
It's just for Valentine's. One
night only.
VICTOR, mid forties, is dressed as a construction worker.

VICTOR
Is it your first time with another man?

BASIL
It's not for me, it's for a friend.

FELIPE
You don't have to be ashamed of yourself.

RANDY
Everyone likes to experiment.

DAVID
It's only natural.

They move in closer. Basil's voice falters.

BASIL
I assure you, it's not for me.

GLENN
How do you know you won't like it?

ALEX
It's a chance to show your manhood!

Alex puts a hand on his back. Basil tenses.

BASIL
Here's his number. Thanks.

He gives him a scrap of paper and pushes past them.
BASIL (V.O.)
So Mia's Italian guest spent the
evening with the Village People.
EXT. HIS MAJESTY'S THEATRE - NIGHT.
Basil and Mia, in formal attire, approach the building.

BASIL (V.O.)
And I spent the evening with her.
INT. CAFE - NIGHT.

Basil and Mia at a table, clearly enjoying each other's
company. The rest of the cafe is empty.

BASIL
I can't believe he walked away from
such a good woman. Or danced away.

MIA
Men are like that. They don't know
what's good for them.

BASIL
I don't know many men who'd marry a
bearded lady!

They laugh. A WAITER approaches.

WAITER
We're closing now.

MIA
(checks watch)
Hey, it's two in the morning!

They exchange a warm smile.
CUT TO:

INT. PARK - DAY.
A small child approaches a large swan. An elderly jogger
pushes himself to the limit. Basil and Mia sit ona

bench with sandwiches.

BASIL
Everything okay?

MIA
(distant)
Yeah

BASIL
You're a little withdrawn.

Mia takes her time to respond.

MIA
What are we doing?
BASIL
Having lunch.

MIA
(chooses words carefully)
You're a very interesting person. And
so easy to talk to. It's just
there's nothing about you ... I don't
have any of the feelings I usually get
that distinguish a lover from a friend.

Basil, floored, forces a laugh.

BASIL
Well that's as blunt as a... punch
in the nose.

MIA

I'm sorry. I don't like leaving things
unsaid. And I'm assuming you like me.
I don't know what you're looking for.

BASIL
What are you looking for?

It's Mia's turn to force a laugh.

MIA
I don't know that either! Someone who
likes rugby, not ballet.

BASIL
I really don't like ballet -

MIA
Of course you do! And you shouldn't have
to change who you are to be with someone.
Me, I'm into guys who are ... masculine.
I'm sorry, that's a terrible thing to say.

BASIL
It's nothing my psychologist can't get
me over.
MIA

You see a shrink?

BASIL
No, I was joking.
MIA
I'm sorry, I'm just a bit of a puzzle.

BASIL
Stop apologising. I understand. I
reject good people all the time.

MIA
You do?

BASIL
Well, yeah. I work for the government
film funding body.

MIA
You're such a great person. So honest.

I'd really love to be friends.

Eager, she waits for a response. Basil puts on a brave
face and throws up his hands.

BASIL
Of course!

Mia hugs him. The large swan chases the small boy. The
elderly jogger comes to a stop, about to collapse. Mia
looks relieved, Basil, crushed.

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY.

Basil sits with the decrepit shrink once more.

SEYMOUR
We all. Have turning points. In our
lives.

BASIL

You said that last time! Do you not
have anything else to add?

KEVIN PENKIN: "GYPSY COIN".

INT. BASIL'S FLAT - DAY.

Basil is slumped on his couch, a random TELEVISION
documentary playing in front of him.
10.
TELEVISION
The mouse is often toyed with by

the cat before it is killed.

Basil sits up and takes note.
CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY.
Basil and Mia walk HOWARD, an ugly dog.
BASIL

I never had a father. Growing up, I
didn't have anyone to teach me how

to ... be a man. Masculine.
MIA
(touched)

I'm so sorry.

BASIL
It's been tough.

MIA
I know. I never had a mother.

BASIL
Really? Maybe we should introduce your
Dad to my Mum?

She laughs at the crazy idea.

EXT. BEAT - DAY.

Basil speaks with Victor as he emerges from the seedy
club.

BASIL
Are you a genuine construction worker
or is that just a costume for your
role playing?

VICTOR
Yeah, I'm a chippy.

BASIL
Is there any chance you might take on
a volunteer assistant?
11.
INT. LIVING ROOM, MIA'S FLAT - DAY.

Basil and Mia sit on the couch with cups of coffee.
Howard watches Basil with suspicion.

MIA
His name's Howard. I got him when
my boyfriend and I broke up. He's
not really an indoors dog. But I
don't know where else to keep him.
And I hate sleeping alone.

Saliva drips from the animal's mouth.

BASIL
You must!

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY.

Basil and Mia pass the menswear department. Mia pulls a
flannelette shirt from a rack and holds it up against
Basil, judging its size.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY.

Men at work on the frame of a house. Basil, dressed in
the flannelette shirt, is having trouble building a frame

for a much smaller structure. Victor approaches.

VICTOR
What are you doing?

BASIL
Building a dog kennel.

Victor inspects the workmanship. It's laughably bad.

BASIL
I'll come and work on the house in
a minute.
VICTOR
(rushed)

No, no! We're right! We don't need
your help. Stay there.
12.
INT. BASIL'S FLAT - DAY.
Basil reads a book titled "How to Be a Man". He writes
notes as he reads.
INT. TRAIN - DAY.

Basil sits on his own, deep in thought.

EXT. YARD, MIA'S FLAT - DAY.

Basil and Mia stand in front of a cute, well-made dog
kennel. Mia is impressed. So is the dog.

MIA
Where did you get this?

BASIL
I wish I could say I built it. Truth
is, I picked it up second hand. Just
gave it a fresh coat of paint. Is it
alright?

She kisses his cheek.
MIA
It's lovely!
INT. PARK - DAY.
Basil and Mia eat lunch and watch passers-by.
MIA
You should grow facial hair. Maybe
even a beard.
BASIL
I'd get food caught in it. I am who
Iam. I'm sorry if you don't like that.
INT. LIVING ROOM, MIA'S FLAT - DAY.
Basil, Mia and the dog, dressed in football colours, sit

on the couch and watch a game. While Mia is wildly
enthusiastic, Basil looks like he'd rather be elsewhere.
13.
INT. FLORIST'S SHOP - DAY.
Basil is joking with CASSIE, another shop assistant. Mia
arrives and looks at Basil with disapproval.
EXT. FLORIST'S SHOP - DAY.
Basil and Mia walk along.

MIA
Why was she flirting with you?

BASIL
She wasn't flirting.

MIA
I saw her!

BASIL
We were just talking.

MIA
About what?

BASIL
I don't know. Random stuff. How
backward Western Australia is without
daylight saving.

MIA
The girl's had more boyfriends than
hot meals.

INT. CAFE - NIGHT.
Mia hands Basil a ticket.

BASIL
"Giselle"?

MIA
Only if you want to go. I'm going with
my friends. Just thought I'd get an
extra ticket. Since I owe you.

BASIL
Of course.
14.
EXT. HIS MAJESTY'S THEATRE - NIGHT.

The cultured, well-dressed, upper class arrive.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT.

Innocent Giselle dances with the deceitful Albrecht.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT.
CLAUDETTE, fifty, stands with Mia. On the other side of
the foyer, Basil is the centre of attention. He talks

with Mia's friends enthusiastically. Claudette watches.

CLAUDETTE
Where ever did you meet him?

Mia is surprised by her friends' interest.
MIA
I don't know. He just came into

the shop. What's Samantha doing?

CLAUDETTE
Looks like she's giving him her number.

In the distance, SAMANTHA writes on a paper napkin and
passes it to Basil. Mia is not impressed.

EXT. MIA'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Mia holds Basil's arm as he walks her home. When they
reach her door, she abruptly turns and kisses his lips.
It's a lingering kiss, Basil gives a lukewarm response.
Mia unlocks her door. She stands in the entrance and
watches Basil, then she moves inside, leaving the door

open. Basil follows, shutting the door behind him.

A moment later, the door opens and the dog is thrown out.

EXT. MIA'S FLAT - MORNING.

The street slumbers. A lone milk truck does the rounds.
15.
INT. BEDROOM, MIA'S FLAT - MORNING.

Basil sits on the edge of the bed, buttoning up his
shirt. Mia, having just awoken, watches him.

MIA
Hey.
BASIL
Hey.
She smiles. Basil is not as warm. Mia rubs his arm.
BASIL

What are we doing?

MIA
What do you mean?

BASIL
You're a very interesting person.
But I don't have any of the feelings
I usually get that distinguish a
lover from a friend.

Mia laughs, not taking him seriously.

MIA
I didn't mean that! I was confused.

BASIL
I'm not.

Her smile drops.

BASIL
I'm sorry. But I don't like leaving
things unsaid. I prefer girls who
aren't so ... fickle.

MIA
Why didn't you tell me this last night?

BASIL
I guess I'm just a bit of a puzzle,
really.

Basil pulls an expression of mock confusion, clearly
enjoying quoting her. Mia's anger mounts.
16.

MIAS
You’re only the second guy I’ve ever
slept with!
BASIL
(dismissive)

Yeah, I’ve heard that before.

She slaps him hard in the face, pounds her fists against
his chest and throws his wallet and keys in the direction
of the door.

MIA
Just get out! Go!

BASIL
(insincere)
But ... I'd really love to be friends.
EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY.

The train pulls away from the platform.

BASIL (V.O.)
We all have turning points in our
lives. I was now at a stage where

I'd live by my wits and trust my luck.

INT. TRAIN - DAY.

Basil sits on his own, looking smug. He toys with the
crumpled napkin bearing Samantha's number.

BASIL (V.O.)
Sure, what I had done to Mia was
selfish, heartless, despicable.

A smile lifts the corners of his mouth.

BASIL (V.O.)
And for the first time in my life -

CUT TO BLACK.
The sound of the accelerating train.

BASIL (V.O.)
I felt like a man.
