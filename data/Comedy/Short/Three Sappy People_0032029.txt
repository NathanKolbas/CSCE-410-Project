Three Sappy People

FADE IN:

INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY

A fancy party is in progress. The butler, a large man named WILLIAMS, spoons 
some punch from a bowl into a glass as THE COUNTESS, a snooty woman with a 
long cigarette holder and a monocle, looks on.

				THE COUNTESS
		Isn't it rather odd that your mistress hasn't 
		put in an appearance at her own party?

				WILLIAMS
			(hands her the punch)
		Uh, yes, Madame. I'm sorry, Madame.

The Countess walks off with disdain. The butler shoots a glance across the 
room. We follow his gaze with a FAST PAN TO the man of the house MR. RUMSFORD,
a rather mousy gentlemen who sits worriedly in a chair. His friend DR. YORK 
stands over him, smoking a cigar.

				RUMSFORD
			(to himself)
		Where is she? 

Rumsford pounds his fist into his hand and rises abruptly.

				RUMSFORD
		Where is that wife of mine?

				DR. YORK
		Now, take it easy, Rumsford.

Williams arrives with a tray of drinks. 

				WILLIAMS
		A drink, sir?

Rumsford and York each take a drink.

				RUMSFORD
			(to Williams)
		Any word from Mrs. Rumsford?

				WILLIAMS
		Not a word, sir. I'm terribly upset.

				RUMSFORD
		You're upset.  What about me? She invites all 
		these people to her birthday party and then 
		runs out on them!

				WILLIAMS
		She always does that, sir.  She'll probably be 
		back in a day or two.

				RUMSFORD
			(chokes on his drink)
		Day or two?!

Williams makes a face and walks off.

				DR. YORK
		Snap out of it, Rumsford. You must make 
		allowances for her youth. Sherry'll turn up.

				RUMSFORD
		If I didn't love that woman so much, I swear 
		I'd--

A car horn HONKS. Rumsford and York stare in horror as an automobile barrels 
into the living room and SCREECHES to a halt in front of the fireplace. The 
guests GASP in amazement. At the wheel of the car is the missing wife, young 
and vivacious SHERRY RUMSFORD, wearing a hat and a fur coat. She waves to her 
husband and starts to climb out of the car.

				SHERRY
		Oh, darling!  Hello!  Be right over! 

Williams enters and stares in shock at the car.

				SHERRY (o.s.)
		Oh, Williams!

Williams regains his composure and stands at attention.

				WILLIAMS
			(with some resignation) 
		Ready, Madame.

Sherry takes off her fur coat while Rumsford and York exchange uneasy glances. 
She throws her fur coat across the room at Williams and it miraculously 
drapes itself goofily around his shoulders. She takes off her hat and throws 
it onto Williams' head. He looks rather ridiculous in a lady's hat and fur 
but bears the humiliation with dignity. Meanwhile, Rumsford confers with York.

				RUMSFORD
		Listen, York. You're a doctor and you're my 
		best friend. Isn't there anything you can do 
		for her?

				DR. YORK
		I'm afraid she's a bit out of my line. The men 
		you want are Doctors Ziller, Zeller, and 
		Zoller.

				RUMSFORD
		Do you think they can help her?

				DR. YORK
		Well, they're the finest psychiatrists in the 
		business. They're terribly expensive and their 
		methods are very peculiar. But they do get 
		results.

				RUMSFORD
		I'll have Williams call them. I'll have 
		Williams call them immediately.

Rumsford rings for the butler. York checks his watch.

				DR. YORK
		I've got to see a patient, Rummy. I'll try to 
		get back later. Good luck.

				RUMSFORD
		Thanks.

York exits as Williams approaches.

				RUMSFORD
		Oh, Williams. I want you to telephone Doctors 
		Ziller, Zeller, and Zoller.

INT. DOCTORS' OFFICE - DAY

Painted onto the glass of the office's front door, a sign reads:

		Dr. Z. ZILLER, M.D.
		Dr. X. ZELLER, M.D.
		Dr. Y. ZOLLER, M.D.

		PSYCHIATRISTS

	ENTER

We PAN from the door to reveal a PAINTER cleaning up his equipment (paint 
cans, brushes, etc.) and a SECRETARY who struggles with a recalcitrant 
telephone switchboard.

				SECRETARY
			(upset)
		Oh, this switchboard!

The secretary holds the headphone to her ear as she tries to get a line out.

				SECRETARY
		Oh, it's dead!

Frustrated, she throws the headphone down and turns to the painter.

				SECRETARY
		Thank goodness you're through. I've been almost 
		crazy.

				PAINTER
		Yes, ma'am. I'll have my stuff out right after 
		lunch.

The secretary exits into a private office as the painter exits out the front 
door. Immediately, the Three Stooges enter from the front door: LARRY, MOE and 
CURLY. Moe carries a tool box. Curly carries a huge ladder over his shoulder.

				LARRY
		Looks like there's nobody here.

				MOE
		This is the place all right.

				CURLY
		Maybe I got the--

Curly turns to look around and SMASHES the glass of the front door with his 
ladder.

				LARRY
		You puddin'-head!  Why don't you look what 
		you're doin'?

				CURLY
		I couldn't help it. I was lookin' around to see 
		if there's anybody in the office and when I 
		turned--

Curly turns and SMASHES a glass water cooler with the ladder.

				MOE
		Look what you did!

				CURLY
		What?!

Curly turns to look at the smashed water cooler and the ladder swings around 
and POPS Moe in the face.

				MOE
		Oh!

Moe clutches his eye in pain. He advances on Curly.

				MOE
		Why don't you be careful?

Moe pokes Curly in the eye.

				LARRY
		Drop that ladder before you hurt somebody.

Curly DROPS the ladder on Moe's foot. Moe clutches his foot in pain.

				MOE
		Remind me to tear out your Adam's apple.

				CURLY
		I'll make a note of it.

As Curly reaches into his pocket, the secretary returns and sees the mess 
they've made. Curly, with a tiny pencil and pad, makes a note to himself to 
remind Moe to tear out his Adam's apple.

				MOE
			(annoyed)
		Give me that!

Moe grabs the pencil away from Curly. Curly squeals and pulls another pencil 
from his pocket and starts to write with it. Moe grabs the pencil away.

				MOE
		What's the matter with you?

Curly makes a few noises of frustration and then pulls a giant-sized pencil 
from his jacket and starts to write.

				CURLY
		Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk.

Moe grabs the pencil and HITS Curly over the head with it.

				CURLY
		Oh! You'll break my pencil!

				MOE
		I'll break your head.

Moe pulls a hair out of Curly's chest and Curly squeals in pain as the 
secretary joins them.

				SECRETARY
		Say, what war is this?

				MOE
		Never mind the wisecracks, Toots. We're 
		trouble-shooters from the phone company. What's 
		wrong here?

				SECRETARY
		Painters ruined my switchboard.

				MOE
		Come on.

The Stooges move to the switchboard.

				SECRETARY
		If you can bring it to life and a call comes in 
		for the doctors, say they're out of town. I'm 
		goin' to lunch.

				MOE
		Okay.

As the secretary exits, Curly calls after her.

				CURLY
		Hey! Bring me back a piece of burnt toast and a 
		rotten egg!

				LARRY
		Burnt toast and a rotten egg?

				CURLY
		Yeah, I got a tapeworm and that's good enough 
		for 'im.

				MOE
			(pushes Curly)
		Go on!  Get busy!

The Stooges get to work. Curly sees a stethoscope in a doctor's bag atop the 
switchboard. He pulls it out and puts the earpieces in his ear.

				MOE
			(to Larry)
		How's she comin'?

				LARRY
		Not so good.

Curly puts the stethoscope against the switchboard.

				CURLY
			(to the switchboard)
		Say, "Ahh!"

				MOE
			(to Curly, off the stethoscope)
		What do you got here?

Moe pulls on the stethoscope, stretching it out.

				CURLY
		Hey, gimme that! Gimme that!  

Moe releases the stethoscope -- it snaps back and WHACKS Curly in the nose.

				CURLY
		Ohhh!

Moe violently pulls the earpieces from Curly's ears, causing a POPPING sound.
Curly GNASHES his teeth pneumatically at Moe who hands the stethoscope back 
to him.

				MOE
		Now, go on! Get busy like I told ya! 
			(to Larry)
		Go on!

Moe shoos Larry away from the board, sits, and puts on the headphones.  He 
puts a phone wire up to a hole in the board.

				MOE
		Pull this line through and hook it on number 
		six.

Curly pulls the line through the hole in the board -- but the line is 
attached to the headphones on Moe's head, thus causing Moe's head to be 
pulled forward violently. Moe's head SMASHES into the board. 

				MOE
		Oh!

Moe pulls his head back, drawing the wire backwards. This frustrates Curly 
who squeals and pulls on it again -- too hard. He stumbles backward and out 
of the scene.  There is a huge CRASH.  Moe and Larry jump in horror as we PAN 
QUICKLY TO Curly sitting in a bucket amidst the painter's equipment, each of 
his hands stuck in a paint can and a wooden plank on his head.

				CURLY
		Woo-woo. Woo-hoo-hoo. Hey, Larry!  Help me!  
		I'm surrounded! Woo-hoo-hoo!

Moe and Larry rush to Curly's aid. They push the plank away and, each 
grabbing an arm, lift Curly to his feet.

				MOE
		Get up. 
			(to Larry, off the bucket
			wedged onto Curly's rear)
		Get a hold o' that!

Moe grabs Curly by the head and Larry pulls the bucket off of Curly's rear. 
Larry FALLS to the floor in the process.

Williams is on the phone, making a call.

			(into the phone)
		Hello? 
			(beat) 
		Yes, I know it's out of order. I've been trying 
		for half an hour to get it.

INT. DOCTORS' OFFICE - DAY

The Stooges stand together and confer.

				MOE
			(to Curly)
		What's the matter with you, puddin'-head? You 
		been actin' slug-nutty all day.

				CURLY
		It's Gertie. She's gonna have--

Curly grows suddenly bashful.  But Moe realizes what he means.

				MOE
		That's wonderful. When do you expect it?

				CURLY
		Any minute. That's why I'm so upset.

				MOE
		No foolin'? Why didn't you tell us?

				CURLY
		But, you see, I--

				LARRY
		I know. You're broke.

				CURLY
			(nods)
		Flat as a floogie.

				MOE
		That's bad. We gotta figure out a way to get 
		some money and get it quick.

				CURLY
		Aw, thanks, Moe.

				MOE
		You're welcome.

Moe and Curly shake hands.

				CURLY
		Okay, I got--

Moe looks down in disgust at his hand, now stained with paint, like Curly's. 
Moe wipes his hand on Curly's jacket.

				MOE
		Come on.

Curly barks like a dog. Moe CONKS Curly in the back of the head.

				MOE
		Come on! Get to work!

The Stooges head back to the switchboard.

INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - DAY

Williams is still on the phone.

				WILLIAMS
		Now, Operator, you must get that number. Now, 
		try again, please.

								CUT TO:

INT. DOCTORS' OFFICE - DAY

Larry struggles with some phone wires.  Frustrated, he whips one away.

				LARRY
			(disgusted)
		Ahhh...

Miraculously, the wire lodges in the proper hole: a light flashes and the 
board starts to BUZZ. The Stooges rush to the board and Moe answers the call.

				MOE
		Hello, Operator?

		Ooooh! I love to play trains!  
			(imitates a train)
		Choo choo choo choo choo! Whooo-woo! Sssssssh!

				MOE
			(to Curly)
		Why don't you get a toupee with some brains in 
		it?

Moe THWACKS Curly's nose. Curly pulls up Moe's bangs and CONKS him on the 
forehead.

				MOE
			(to Curly)
		Why, you--!

Moe turns his attention to the phone.

								CUT TO:

INT. DOCTORS' OFFICE - DAY

		I want to speak to Doctor Ziller, Zeller, or

		Money is no object.

INT. DOCTORS' OFFICE - DAY

				MOE
			(into the phone)
		We'll be there in a flash in the flesh!

Moe hangs up and addresses Larry and Curly.

				MOE
		We need money and I got a way to get it.

				LARRY
		What are we supposed to do?

				MOE
			(points to Curly)
		You're Ziller. 
			(points to Larry)
		You're Zeller.

		And I'm Doctor Zoller.

				CURLY
			(shakes Moe's hand)
		Oh, glad to meetcha, Doctor.

				MOE
		How are ya, son?

				CURLY
		Now, listen, Doc. I'm troubled with T.S.

				MOE
		What do you mean, T.S.?

				CURLY
		Two Stomachs!

				MOE
		Stick out yer tongue!

Curly sticks out his tongue. Moe PUNCHES him in one of his stomachs.

				MOE
		There's an impatient patient waiting. Come on.

Although they protest, Moe grabs Curly by the ear and Larry by the hair and 
drags them away.

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RUMSFORD MANSION - DAY

Sherry comes running out of the building, followed by Rumsford and Williams. 
A chauffeur waits beside a fancy car (license number 5R 161). 

				RUMSFORD
		Wait! Sherry, you can't run out on your guests 
		like this again.

				SHERRY
		But, darling, I'm bored! I'm only going for a 
		short ride in a submarine! I'll be back in a 
		day or two. Tell them all to wait.

				RUMSFORD
		But, Sh--

They are interrupted by the gentle RINGING of bicycle bells. The Stooges -- 
dressed in top hats and tails -- come riding up on a three-seater bicycle. 
They fall off the bike at the edge of the driveway -- to the shock and 
confusion of the Rumsfords. The Stooges rise and rush over to Rumsford.

				RUMSFORD
		Gentlemen, I'm Mr. Rumsford. Are you looking 
		for someone?

				CURLY
		I'm Ziller.

				LARRY
		I'm Zeller.

				MOE
		I'm Zoller.

As Sherry looks on with interest, Moe puts a shoe horn near Rumsford's mouth.

				MOE
		Stick out yer tongue.

Rumsford opens his mouth and Moe uses the shoe horn as a tongue depressor.

				MOE
		Say, "Ahh" with your mouth closed.

				RUMSFORD
		Ahhh.

				LARRY
			(singing in harmony)
		Ahhh.

				MOE & CURLY
			(joining in)
		Ahhh.

				ALL THREE STOOGES
			(singing)
		Ahhh... 
			(spoken, with disgust)
		Rats!

				MOE
		This is serious.

				CURLY
		You're wrong, gentlemen. It's strictly a case 
		of latkes and [pippiks?]

Sherry roars with laughter at the Stooges.

				SHERRY
			(practically squealing)
		This is priceless.

				RUMSFORD
			(to the Stooges)
		I'm not the patient. It's Mrs. Rumsford.

The chauffeur looks on with amazement as the Stooges turn to Sherry.

				CURLY
		Oh. How do you do, Madame?

				RUMSFORD
		Now, see here, Sherry...

				SHERRY
		Oh, darling, you take the submarine ride. I 
		wouldn't leave these men on a bet. Come, 
		gentlemen! The last one in is a Republican!

Sherry suddenly bolts for the front door.  The Stooges take off in happy 
pursuit, with Curly circling Rumsford like an airplane before taking off 
after her.  A stunned Rumsford quickly follows.

								CUT TO:

INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - LIVING ROOM

Sherry runs in, followed closely by the Stooges. Moe plows into Williams, 
upsetting the tray of pretzels he carries and knocking him out of the shot.  
Sherry laughs gaily throughout.  After a moment, there is a CRASH and a 
woman's SHRIEK. Sherry and the Stooges turn to look at the sofa where 
Williams now lies in the Countess' lap beside a mustached guest named John.  
Everyone is covered with pretzels. John has the pretzel bowl lid on his head.

				WILLIAMS
			(totally mortified)
		Oh, Countess. I'm so sorry.

The Countess has a pretzel wedged around her eye like a monocle.  She puts 
her own monocle up to the other eye, trying to keep her dignity.

				THE COUNTESS
		Really!

Sherry hurries over to help straighten things up.

				SHERRY
			(to guest with lid on his head)
		Oh, John!

Rumsford rushes in and joins the Stooges.  He sees the mess and winces.

				RUMSFORD
		Ooooh!

Sherry starts to take the lid off John's head.

				SHERRY
		I'll get you a drink.

She removes the lid but his toupee comes off with it, leaving him bald as a 
ping pong ball.  He clutches his head in horror.  A distraught Rumsford 
confers with the Stooges.
 
				RUMSFORD
		Gentlemen, what will I do with her? Now, let me 
		tell you a little bit about Sherry.

				MOE
		Oh, don't bother. I'll take Scotch.

				LARRY
		Make mine rye.

				CURLY
		I'll take gin smothered in bourbon. Nyuk, nyuk.

				MOE
			(to Larry and Curly)
		Boys.

Moe motions with eyes and head to something o.s.  They follow his gaze.  They 
stare at each other for a split second before racing away from Rumsford and 
over to a table loaded with drinks.  Sherry stands at the punch bowl fixing a 
drink.

				SHERRY
		Gentlemen, do have some rum punch.

Sherry leaves with the drink and a tray of hors d'oeuvres.

				CURLY
		Rum punch? Why, soitanly. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, 
		nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

Curly removes his gloves. Larry pulls the stethoscope from his pocket.

				LARRY
			(off the stethoscope)
		I knew this thing would come in handy.

Larry removes the earpieces from the stethoscope, leaving only the rubber 
tubing.  Moe watches as Larry offers one of the earpiece tubes to Curly.

				LARRY
		Will you join me?

The business end of the stethoscope is dropped into the bunch bowl.

				CURLY
		Soitanly. Skoal.

				LARRY
		Skoal.

Using the tubing as a tandem drinking straw, Larry and Curly SLURP up some of 
the rum punch.  After a moment, they stop and make faces.

				LARRY
		This is weak.

				CURLY
		Yeah. The rum went through this punch on 
		stilts.

Moe takes a bottle from the table, opens it and takes a whiff.

				MOE
		This Scotch ought to help.

				LARRY
			(picking up another bottle)
		This gin should make it fizzy.

				CURLY
			(with two bottles)
		Bourbon and rum ought to help some.

Curly sniffs one of the bottles.  He sneezes twice and is about to sneeze 
again when Sherry returns to the table and offers him a tray.

				SHERRY
			(to Curly)
		Hors d'oeuvre?

				CURLY
		No. Hay fever.

Sherry busts out laughing at this and walks off.  The Stooges pour the 
various bottles into the punch bowl.  When these are emptied, they turn to 
some other bottles on the table.

				MOE
		Hey, here's some new kind of liquor. 
		Wor-cester-shire! 
			(pours Worcestershire sauce
			into the punch bowl)
		Oh, ho ho ho.

				LARRY
		This says "Tabasco" -- I ain't never drunk any. 
		But we'll put it in. 

				MOE
		What have you got to lose?

Larry pours hot Tabasco sauce into the bowl.  Curly squeals and claps his 
hands with delight as he finds a bottle of his own.

				CURLY
		Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.  Sham paynee!

Curly POPS the cork on his champagne bottle.  The cork flies off and 
champagne SPRITZES out of the top.  Curly covers the bottle with his hand to 
stop the flow.  After a pause he looks over at Moe and does a double take.  
We SWISH PAN TO discover Moe with the champagne cork wedged in his right eye.  
Moe grimaces, pulls the cork from his eye, stares at it for a second, puts it 
down, and confronts Curly.

				MOE
		You shouldn't handle dangerous weapons. 
			(off the champagne bottle)
		Give me that.

				CURLY
		I will not!

				MOE
		Let me have it!

				CURLY
			(reluctantly)
		Ohhh...

Curly removes his hand and the foam SPRAYS Moe.  Curly directs the stream of 
champagne into the punch bowl while Moe BOPS Curly's head several times in 
succession.  Larry calls Moe's attention to the punch bowl.

				LARRY
		Look!  It's boiling.

The punch is practically steaming.

				CURLY
		It must be done.

The Stooges grab little glass cups and dip them into the bowl.  They clink 
their glasses together and all three drink simultaneously.  After a moment, 
they wince horribly and belch PUFFS of smoke from their mouths.  They put 
down their glasses and wipe their mouths, looking rather pleased.

				LARRY
		A marvelous accomplishment.

				MOE
		A prodigious achievement.

				CURLY
		You said it! It's putrid!

Suddenly, Rumsford joins the Stooges at the table.

				RUMSFORD
		Gentlemen, would you be good enough to look my 
		wife over now?

				MOE
		A pleasure.

				RUMSFORD
		This way.

The Stooges follow Rumsford to the sofa where Sherry and the Countess sit 
talking.

				RUMSFORD
			(to Sherry)
		The doctor's going to look you over, dear.

				SHERRY
		Oh, goody.

Curly joins Sherry and the Countess on the sofa, sitting between them.  Moe 
and Larry stand nearby.

				MOE
			(to Sherry)
		Now, uh, we shall test your reflex first.

				SHERRY
		Okay, Doctor.

				CURLY
		Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

Sherry's legs are crossed and Curly taps her just below the knee to test her 
reflexes. But nothing happens.  Sherry just laughs. Curly squeals in 
frustration and taps her again.  Still nothing.  Curly squeals and palms his 
face.

				CURLY
		This is the way a normal reflex should act.

To demonstrate, Curly crosses his own legs and taps himself below the knee.  
Nothing.  He does a double take and scowls at Sherry.  Now, Curly turns to 
the Countess sitting beside him and taps her knee, still with no result.

				THE COUNTESS
			(offended, to Curly)
		I beg your pardon.

Delighted with Curly's boldness, Sherry gasps and puts a hand to her mouth.

				CURLY
			(to the Countess)
		Oh, you don't have to apologize. You can't help 
		it you're crazy.

The Countess is so shocked by this remark that the monocle pops out of her 
eye.

				MOE
			(to Curly)
		C'mere, guinea pig. 

Curly rises, sits on the arm of the sofa, and crosses his legs.  Moe kneels 
beside him and prepares to show him how it's done. (Meanwhile, some of the 
other guests, including the Countess, start tapping themselves below the 
knee.)

				MOE
			(professorially)
		Now, then. Holding the palm at a forty-five 
		degree angle...

Moe taps Curly below the knee.  Nothing happens. 

				MOE
		Must be off a couple of degrees.

Moe tries again.  Still nothing.

				MOE
			(upset, to Curly)
		Trouble is, you've got no life.

Moe KETTLE DRUMS Curly in the stomach.  Curly's leg lashes out and KICKS Moe, 
sending him backward.  

				MOE
		Oh!

Curly backs away, squealing, afraid of retaliation.  Reaching the other side 
of the room, Curly trips over the leg of a bookish guest who sits in a chair, 
reading a newspaper.  Curly falls to the floor.

				CURLY
			(to the guest)
		Pardon me.

				GUEST
		I'm sorry.

The guest goes back to reading his paper and crosses his legs.  Still on the 
floor, Curly sees the guest's crossed legs and decides to tap him below the 
knee. He hits it hard and makes a loud wooden THUMP.  The guest puts his 
paper down and stares at Curly who squeals in frustration before THUMPING the 
leg again. Finally, Curly smacks himself in the face a few times and karate 
CHOPS the leg.  Curly clutches his hand in pain and HOWLS.  The guest gives 
Curly an "it serves you right" nod.  The guest uncrosses the leg and when it 
BANGS loudly to the floor we realize it is a wooden leg.  Curly stares at 
this, reaches down, and KNOCKS on the wood.  It sounds like someone knocking 
at a door, so Curly says:

				CURLY
		Come in.

Curly pulls the guest's trouser leg up to reveal the actual wood -- and a 
tiny sign that reads: POST NO BILLS.  Curly rises and backs away in horror 
until he encounters a large white marble statue of a muscular man sitting on 
a pedestal.  Sort of a cut-rate version of Rodin's The Thinker. Curly eyes 
the statue's bent leg and contemplates tapping its knee with glee.

				CURLY
		Ooo-oohh. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

Curly taps the statue's knee and -- improbably -- obtains the desired result: 
the statue's leg flexes.  In response, an amazed Curly barks like a dog at 
the statue. Then pauses to wonder how the statue could have come to life. (It 
is, of course, a male model made up to look like a statue.)  

Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, Moe, Larry and the other guests are 
all bent over, tapping their legs below the knee.  Williams enters and makes 
an announcement.

				WILLIAMS
		Dinner is served.

Moe straightens up and turns to Larry.

				MOE
		Eats!

Curly starts GIBBERING like a madman and running in place.  Moe jumps over 
the sofa.  Larry runs around it and hops on Moe's back for a piggy-back ride 
into the dining room. The guests and Williams watch all this with stunned 
looks while Sherry laughs happily. Finally, Curly runs over and jumps on 
Williams' back for his own piggy-back ride into the dining room.

				SHERRY
			(laughing, to the stunned guests)
		Aren't they marvelous?

								DISSOLVE TO:

INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY

Everyone save Williams is seated at the dining room table.  Sherry sits at 
the head of the table.  On her right sits Moe and Larry (when Larry tries to 
flirt with the lady on his right, Moe grabs him violently by the hair). On 
Sherry's left sits Curly.  To Curly's left is the Countess.  Rumsford sits at 
the other end of the table, opposite Sherry.  The seating arrangement looks 
like this:

			Sherry
		Moe		Curly
		Larry		The Countess
		Lady		Male Guest
		?		Matronly Woman
		?		John
			Rumsford

Everyone has a cream puff in front of them.  We know what that means...

				CURLY
			(to Sherry)
		I just love cream puffs.

				SHERRY
		Oh, I hope you gentlemen will like my Spanish 
		dinner.

				CURLY
		I'm just crazy about Spanish food -- especially 
		corned beef and cabbage.

				SHERRY
			(laughing, to guests)
		Isn't he funny?  Ha ha ha!

Curly notices the Countess looking around for something.

				CURLY
		What's all the fuss?

				THE COUNTESS
		I believe I dropped my serviette.

				CURLY
		Well, just keep seated. Nobody'll notice it.

The Countess gives him a look.  Curly shoots her a look right back.

				CURLY
		Okay, have half of mine.

Curly tears his napkin in half and hands it to the Countess.

				THE COUNTESS
			(snootily)
		Thenk you.

Curly grins, waves and offers a quiet "Nyuk, nyuk."  Then, Curly sees the 
Countess powdering her face with a powder puff.  He squeals quietly, digs into 
his pocket, and pulls out an electric razor.  He plugs in the razor 
(apparently, the socket is built right into the dining room table) and it 
starts to BUZZ loudly.  Curly starts shaving himself, much to the Countess' 
annoyance.  He yelps when he snags a piece of skin just above his lip.  Then 
he reaches over and starts shaving the Countess' face.  She shrieks and jumps 
in horror at this.

				THE COUNTESS
		Really!

She goes back to powdering her face.  Curly gives her one of his eloquent 
dismissive waves and goes back to shaving.  Williams approaches the Countess 
with a tray.

				WILLIAMS
		Biscuit, Madame?

				THE COUNTESS
		No, thank you.

Williams is about to offer Curly a biscuit but is shocked and offended to see 
him shaving at the dinner table.

				WILLIAMS
			(disapproving)
		Sir?!

				CURLY
		Quiet!

				WILLIAMS
			(regains his composure)
		Biscuit, sir?

				CURLY
			(rubbing his hands with glee)
		Oh, soitanly!

Curly takes a biscuit and sets to work on it with a knife while Williams 
grimaces in disbelief and moves on. William offers the tray to Moe and Larry.

				WILLIAMS
		Biscuit, sir?

Moe and Larry manage to take their biscuits without incident (Larry takes 
two).  While Moe shakes enough salt onto his biscuit to preserve the entire 
Columbia film library, Larry makes a sandwich out of his two biscuits and a 
giant stalk of celery.  With both hands, Larry raises the unwieldy sandwich 
to his mouth and is about to bite into it.

				MOE
			(to Larry)
		Hey. Where's your Emily Post?

Moe's reference to the famous etiquette maven causes Larry to stick both his 
pinkies in the air before biting down joyfully on the sandwich with an 
impolite CRUNCH.  Moe nods in approval and continues to salt his biscuit. 

Meanwhile, the Countess continues powdering her face. Curly has cut his 
biscuit in two and places one half on the table and starts to butter the 
other half.

				CURLY
		This is my favorite dish. Biscuits! Biscuits 
		all the time.

The Countess sets the powder puff down on top of Curly's half-biscuit. He 
finishes buttering, picks up the powder puff by mistake, and puts his
"biscuit" in his mouth.  

He tries to bite off a piece but can't.  He makes a face, then squeals; the 
Countess who now puts on lipstick, gives him a disdainful look; Curly finally 
bites a piece of powder puff, glancing happily at the Countess; struggles to 
chew it, going cross-eyed at the effort; swallows some down; takes another 
bite; squeals, earning another look from the Countess; Curly pauses for a 
moment ... then abruptly stuffs the biscuit in his mouth and tears off 
another piece.  

The Countess sighs and rolls her eyes. Suddenly, Curly starts to choke.  He 
grabs his throat, eyes bulging.  Desperately, he WHACKS the back of his head 
causing face powder to SPEW out of his mouth.  He grabs a water glass from 
off the table and drinks some down.  He turns to look at the Countess and 
grimaces.  The Countess is white with powder and totally mortified.  Sherry 
cracks up at the sight of her.

				SHERRY
			(to Curly)
		You funny, funny man!

				MOE
			(grimly ironic)
		Yes. Isn't he a scream?

Williams serves the tamales, a native Mexican food made of minced meat and 
red peppers rolled in cornmeal and wrapped in corn husks.

				SHERRY
		Ooh, I just love tamales in the Spring!

				CURLY
			(off his tamale)
		What a funny thing. It don't know whether it's 
		comin' or goin'.

Suspicious, Moe and Larry peer at their tamales, at first tapping them 
cautiously, then POUNDING them.  Curly picks his up, shakes it, hears a 
GLOOPY sound from its interior, sets it on his plate, and strikes up a 
conversation with it.

				CURLY
			(to the tamale)
		Speak to me so I'll know which is the head or 
		the tail.

Curly barks at it twice, then pats it gently as if it were a dog.

				CURLY
			(to the tamale)
		Quiet now, quiet. Nyuk, nyuk.

Moe tries to penetrate the corn husk with a spoon, to no avail.

				MOE
			(to himself)
		This thing can't lick me.

Moe tucks his napkin into his collar and starts to manhandle the tamale.  
Meanwhile, Larry uses a fork and a knife on his tamale with no result.

				LARRY
		Mmm. Stubborn, huh?

Finally, Curly figures out that you have to unwrap the darn things and 
happily begins to do so.

				CURLY
		Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

Larry butters and salts his and BITES down on it as if it were corn-on-the-
cob.  Moe tries to finger-poke his tamale as if it were Curly.  Finally, he 
tries to squeeze the life out of it.

				MOE
		Get tough with me-- ?!

Moe SLAMS it to his plate. Sauce SQUIRTS out of it and blackens Moe's face.
He tries to wipe it off, only making it worse.

				MOE
			(off the tamale)
		A bomb!  An infernal machine!

Curly keeps tearing off flakes of husk, finally finding one he likes.  Moe 
starts to do the same.  Curly salts his husk and pops it in his mouth.  Moe 
butters one of his own, puts it with another one, and eats it like a sandwich. 
He claps his hands together and looks satisfied -- until he tastes the husk.  
Then, he pauses to make a face. Curly scrapes sauce off a husk with his knife 
and grows wild-eyed with anticipation as he salts the husk and stuffs his 
mouth with it.  

Larry, having made no progress, bites into one end of his tamale causing 
sauce to STREAM out the other end and blacken Curly's face.  Upset, Curly 
wipes his eye. Larry looks in horror at what he's done.

				CURLY
			(angry, to Larry)
		Why, you--!

Curly picks up a tamale and threatens to throw it at Larry.

				LARRY
		I'm sorry. Don't throw it!  Don't throw it! 

Larry ducks his head into Moe's lap as Curly throws.  The tamale hits and 
spatters Moe.  Moe grabs Larry by the hair and pulls him off his lap.

				MOE
			(to Larry)
		Get up, you. 

Moe SMACKS Larry on the forehead and turns to Curly.

				MOE
			(to Curly)
		Why, you--!

Moe picks up a cream puff to throw at Curly.

				CURLY
		Moe!  Don't!

Curly ducks his head into the Countess' lap as Moe throws.  The cream puff 
hits the Countess in the forehead.  Curly pops up.

				CURLY
		I ducked --

Curly sees the creamed Countess and reacts with horror.  The Countess 
desperately tries to maintain an air of dignity. The young MALE GUEST sitting 
beside her begins to roar with laughter at the sight of her.  So she SMACKS 
him in his open mouth with a cream puff.  Now, it's Sherry's turn to laugh 
hysterically.  The Male Guest grabs a cream puff and eyes the Countess.  He 
rises, much to her dismay, preparing to hit her with it.  

				THE COUNTESS
			(also rising)
		Oh, no no no no no no...

But, at the last second, he throws the cream puff at Sherry instead, hitting 
her square in the face.  Rumsford, sitting at the far end of the table next 
to the guest named John, puts a hand to his head in dismay.  But Sherry, 
smiling like a kid, winds up and pitches her cream puff across the length of 
the table, hitting John. Then she grabs Curly's cream puff and hits Rumsford 
as he is shouting:

				RUMSFORD
		This is outrageous!  I demand that something 
		be done-- !

Sherry laughs even harder than before, shaking in her chair, her mouth wide 
open. Rumsford grabs a cream puff and somehow throws it right into her open 
mouth.  John, wiping some cream from his face, accidentally FLICKS some onto 
the Matronly Woman beside him.  She, in turn, picks up her cream puff and 
SMACKS him with it.  They start throwing the rest of their food at each other.

				MOE
			(to Curly)
		This is all your fault, you--

Moe picks up a cream puff.  Curly hides behind the Countess.

				CURLY
		Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo... Cut it out, Moe!

A cream puff hits the Countess. She sputters. Curly pokes his head out from 
behind her.

				CURLY
		Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

He ducks back. Another cream puff hits the Countess. 

				CURLY
			(to Moe)
		You missed me.

The Countess says something defiant but incomprehensible.

				MOE
		Ehh, that'll teach you!

Moe gets hit by a cream puff. An untouched FEMALE GUEST tries to keep the 
peace.

				FEMALE GUEST
		Folks! This must stop!

The woman is instantly CLOBBERED by a cream puff.  By now, the room has 
degenerated into anarchy: Sherry, Larry, Moe, Curly and the others all either 
throw cream puffs or get hit with them or both.  Curly ducks beneath the 
table and pops up with his napkin covering his head.  Of course, the moment 
he peeks out from behind it, he is WHACKED with a cream puff -- 

				CURLY
		I surrender! I--

Curly rises, grunts, and gets WHACKED again.

				CURLY
		Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

An unsuspecting Williams calmly enters the room and stares wide-eyed in 
amazement. Everyone is throwing food.

				WILLIAMS
		Doctor York just--

Williams gets hit by a cream puff.  Huffily, he turns to exit and gets a cold 
one right in the back of the neck.  He raises his shoulders high, exhales 
deeply, and marches out of the room.

Rumsford and the Stooges crawl on hands and knees away from the rioting 
partygoers and confer in a quieter part of the room. 
 
				RUMSFORD
			(to the Stooges)
		Gentlemen, I think you'd better leave now while 
		my wife's still enjoying herself and before she 
		changes her mind. Believe me, I'm grateful. 
			(pulls out a wad of cash)
		Will-will about fifteen hundred do?

				MOE
			(taking the whole wad)
		Oh, that's just right. Thanks.

Rumsford crawls away to join Sherry while the Stooges count their money.
Sherry is having a ball, throwing and being thrown at.

				SHERRY
		Whoooo!  Ha ha ha!

A smiling Rumsford approaches, carrying a huge chocolate cake that says HAPPY 
BIRTHDAY on it.

				SHERRY
			(happily, off the cake)
		Oh, my birthday cake! Oh, darling, in all my 
		life I've never had so much fun!

Rumsford immediately DUMPS the entire cake on her head.

				RUMSFORD
		Me, too.

They stare at each other, she in disbelief and he, inscrutably, with his 
hands on his hips.

								FADE OUT
