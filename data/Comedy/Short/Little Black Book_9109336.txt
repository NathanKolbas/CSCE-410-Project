FADE IN:
ABOVE A COUPLE

Curled into the classic "spoon" position, deep asleep beneath
a pillowy down comforter. We are:

INT. BEDROOM — DAWN

The digital alarm clock next to the bed reads "5:55 a.m." We
can barely see the man's features by the early morning light,
but this is NATE GOODMAN (33). The sleeping woman next to him
is TARA O'CONNOR (22). We hear a faint BUZZING sound, her
eyes POP open.

Tara rolls away and pulls back the covers to reveal a pager
hooked to her underwear. She scrambles to turn it off.

Tara leans over the bed, extracts a lighted mirror and
quickly applies some non-makeup-looking-makeup, gulps a
travel-sized bottle of mouth wash, swishes, and realizes
there's no place to spit. She grimaces, swallows.

Checking that Nate is still asleep, she lies back down and
expertly draws a lock of blonde hair across her eyes. Tara
is really pretty, but leaves nothing to chance.

The real ALARM sounds. Nate rolls over and turns it off,
facing Tara, he watches her "awaken". He gently brushes the
hair out of her eyes. We now see why she bothered, he’s a
keeper.

NATE
You always look so beautiful...
especially in the morning.

Tara smiles her thanks. They begin to kiss.

CUT TO:

INT. CHAT MAGAZINE OFFICE - MORNING

Tara RACES past the receptionist's desk. DANA SMALL sits
above it all, neat and petite, up to the minute fashion and
hair.

DANA
SHE'S NOT HERE YET -—-

Tara visibly relaxes and walks back. Dana slides a Starbucks
coffee across the reception desk.

TARA
Thanks, did she call?
DANA
I told her you were in the bathroom.
(giving Tara the once-over
Am I having Deja Vu?

Tara nods. Dana unbuttons her cardigan, After a moment, Tara
does the same. They take off their sweaters and EXCHANGE.

TARA
Saving me from the walk of shame and
coffee, too! Oh booba, what would I do
without you?

DANA
You'd be a tired, fired, slut.

CUT TO:

TARA'S DESK - SEA OF CUBICLES - DAY

Tara is buried beneath a pile of papers. She answers
multiple lines, types, swivels around to check on her boss
AUDREY LANFORD, who is now in her office on the phone.

Tara's desk is directly across from Dana's. The Phone RINGS.

TARA (INTO PHONE)
Audrey Lanford's office.

DANA'S VOICE
So...did he say it?

Tara turns her attention to Dana who also wears a headset. If
they just raised their voices they could talk normally.

TARA (INTO PHONE)
No. But he's giving me a drawer.

DANA (INTO PHONE)
Sounds like love to me.
(holding up a list)
Here's the final list of all the people
coming. I got a hold of James Linfield
this morning. He sounded cute.

Tara checks him off her list.

DANA (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D
Is he?

TARA (INTO PHONE)
I haven't met him...I haven't met any of
these people.
DANA (INTO PHONE)
How did you get their numbers?

TARA (INTO PHONE)
Work...his secretary, his phone book.

DANA (INTO PHONE)
You just randomly went through his phone
book?

TARA (INTO PHONE)
Yeah...what?

Dana gets up and crosses over to Tara.

DANA
What if you invited ex-girlfriends?

Tara looks at the list as if for the first time.

TARA
I'd be okay with that, I guess.

DANA
Not you...him. Here are all your ex-
girlfriends from the past five years!
(beat)
SURPRISE!!!

TARA
He hasn’t had any serious relationships
here...he's never mentioned anyone.

DANA
He's a good-looking, single, straight
money maker in Manhattan. Obviously if
you've never heard even a name of an ex,
you just haven't had that talk yet.

Tara suddenly looks worried.

TARA
When are you supposed to have that talk?

MAN'S VOICE
Never.

Tara glances over to the cubicle next to hers.

TARA
Just pretend you can't hear us.
DANA
When the relationship gets serious.

TARA
We're serious.

DANA
But you haven't said "I love you" or
talked about moving in together or
marriage --

Dana is interrupted by an EXPLOSION OF APPLAUSE AND CHEERS.
They turn to see -~-

GROUP OF MALE CO-WORKERS “high fivin’” each other as a CALVIN
KLEIN BILLBOARD goes up across the street. It’s a panel the
size of a football field of a woman’s thigh leading to her
Barbie doll waist.

TARA

I might not know every little detail
about Nate’s past, but I do know he isn’t
into pre-pubescent, anorexic, airbrushed,
fake fantasy models.

(looking at slobbering men)
I’m finally in a relationship where I
don’t have to be suspicious and worried
all the time.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - NIGHT

A cozy table by the window. Nate and Tara lean into one
another, talking. A WAITER comes to the table carrying a
BIRTHDAY CAKE with a candle. Nate leans across the table and

kisses her.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. OUTSIDE OF NATE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Nate tries to unlock the door while unbuttoning the hundred tiny
pearl buttons down Tara's back.

NATE
I'm not going to get this off of you
until midnight --

Tara wriggles around to face him.

TARA
Careful, it's vintage...
NATE
So am I.

TARA
It's early...we haven't really celebrated
your birthday, we could go dancing?

NATE
I'm just looking forward to being alone
with you.

Nate kisses her while pushing open the door...
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Flicks on the light --

EVERYONE
SURPRISE!

Nate grabs Tara as DOZENS pop out of nowhere. He quickly
looks around to see all his FRIENDS and CO-WORKERS. He
smiles at Tara, shaking his head.

DISSOLVE TO:

APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Tara and Dana stand off to the side, watching late GUESTS
arrive. Beautiful WOMAN after beautiful WOMAN walk through
the door. Dana nudges Tara as they greet Nate.

DANA
That was casual...

A tall, BLONDE brushes Nate's cheek with a "hello", a
BRUNETTE waits her turn. They hug.

DANA (cont'd)
That was a little warmer than just co-
worker, don't you think?

TARA
Dana ~~

But you can see that Tara is evaluating each and every woman
the same way. She straightens her dress self-consciously.

TARA (cont'd)
I better get their coats.

CUT TO:
HALLWAY - LATER

Nate talks with a slick-looking, Wall Street-type, ALEX MERNIT.

ALEX
All I know is she's back and she's asking
about you.

NATE
I'm in a relationship, Alex.
(shrugging)
Tara's only twenty-two...but she doesn't
play mind games, she knows who she is.
(taking a drink)
I'm the fucked up one.

ENTRANCE TO HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Tara staggers forward carrying a huge PILE of COATS.

ALEX
But aren't you even a little curious to
see her?

Tara FREEZES. She cranes her neck around the coats,
they haven't seen her yet.

NATE
No.
(beat)
So..-how is she?

ALEX
See...see, you are. You think about her,
too. Don't deny it!

realizes

Tara quickly steps all the way into the closet, closing the

slatted door behind her.

CLOSET

Tara presses her face against the slats, watching Nate.

NATE
Things are going well with Tara --

ALEX
You've only been going out with her a
couple of months --
CLOSE ON TARA

TARA
(whispers)

Six --

ON NATE AND ALEX
ALEX

You're not married, you're not even
living with her --

Tara watches on in horror.

NATE
I'm not calling her.
ALEX
You two were a great couple --
NATE
And then she dumped me and moved to
London --
ALEX

And now she’s back --

NATE
What do you care?

Alex crosses his arms.

ALEX
I just think there might still be
something there between you two. When

you two got engaged, you were the envy of
every guy I knew --

Tara’s mouth drops open.

ALEX (cont’d)
She’s so smart, and
beautiful...incredible --

NATE
So, you ran into her?

ALEX
No, I heard through George that she’s
still talking about ‘you.
NATE
It’s all in the past, now. I’m going to
get a drink.

Nate walks away. Alex follows.

ALEX
I just want you to be sure about this.

Tara follows them with her eyes, unaware as a MAN opens the
closet door. Tara BURSTS forward, FALLING ON TOP OF HIM,
burying him under coats.

CUT TO:
LIVING ROOM - LATER

The party is over. Dozens of glasses cover every surface.
Ashtrays and wine bottles and general post-party disarray.
Tara follows Nate, collecting glasses.

TARA
So you liked everyone that came...and no
one was missing?

NATE
No, in fact, there were a few people I
wouldn't expect at my birthday party.

TARA
Oh?

NATE
My accountant...uh, my dentist and my
plumber all assured me that they had a
great time.

TARA
I wasn't sure from your phone book...
(laughing)
But that was alright?

NATE
Great. I'm scheduled for a free cleaning
next week, my taxes will be done early
this year and if we ever have a blockage,
we can call Phil at home.
(kissing her)
Thank you.

Nate picks up more glasses, heading for the kitchen. Tara
follows.
KITCHEN

TARA
You have so many nice friends...George
and his wife Sandy, you know, the
newlyweds...they seem so happy. Of
course I've never been close to getting
married, so I wouldn't know about that.

(beat)

What about you?

NATE
Marriage? Not really.

TARA
Did you ever feel like proposing. ..looked
at rings, that kind of thing?

NATE
Why are you asking?

TARA
I don't know...I just realized after
talking to all your friends...and people
from work, that there's a lot of stuff I
don't know. Like...were any of your ex-
girlfriends here tonight?

NATE
No.

TARA
So, do you see any of your ex—
girlfriends, are you still friends with
any of them?

NATE
Absolutely not.

TARA
It would be fine if you were, I'm just
asking. Is there anyone you would like
to keep in contact with?

NATE
Did Dana put you up to this?

TARA
What? No.
10.

NATE
I wouldn’t take advice from a woman who
can’t even commit to a long distance

carrier --

TARA
I just realized we haven’t had this talk
yet.

NATE

You mean the interrogation?

TARA
I can tell you about my ex-boyfriends --

NATE
No thank you.

TARA
I just mean I can share -—

NATE
I don't think the past has anything to do
with us, with what we have right now.
Look, things are going well, right?
You're happy?

Nate takes Tara's hands in his.

TARA
Yes, but I don't like the idea of other
people..acquaintances of yours, knowing
more about you than I do --

NATE
If something came up that was about one
of them, something relevant -~—

TARA
We're talking about it. It's relevant -—

NATE
Why do you want to know this stuff?

TARA
To bring us closer together.

Nate pulls her into an embrace.
NATE

I can think of better ways of bringing us
closer together.
11.

TARA
(smiles)
Alright...I’m letting you off the hook
now, but I do want to talk about
it...later, because I want to know you
better and because...

She stares into his eyes...and she can't stop herself.

TARA (cont'd)
I love you.

There, she said it, blurted it, really.

Nate stares deeply back into her eyes. They stay this way
for what feels like forever.

He pulls her close and then kisses her...on the forehead.

CUT TO:
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

DANA
On the forehead?

Tara nods sullenly.

DANA (cont'd)
Oh my God. Tara, what did I tell you?
Never, ever, ever, ever say it first --

TARA
Too late.

DANA
Look, it's so basic. We're animals, just
watch dogs. It's the males who go around
sniffing our butts, not the other way
around --

TARA
I think it's a little more complicated
than that --

DANA
Is it? Rudge broke up with me because I
made it too easy for him. I liked him
and let it show, and what did he do to
repay me? He went back to his bitchy ex-
girlfriend who treated him like shit.
(MORE)
12.

DANA (cont'd)
I treated him like a God and to repay me
he skated. By telling Nate you love him,
you've disturbed nature's balance.

Tara puts her head on the table.

TARA
Please...I can't breathe...

Dana lowers her face to Tara's level.

DANA
Let's just go over what you heard again.

Tara sits up.

TARA
She was the most intense relationship he
ever had. He almost married her.
Everyone wanted her. He was in love with
her and so was everyone else --

DANA

Got it. So, you may be the rebound.
TARA

Rebound...oh God, that's gotta be it.

(beat)
And he wouldn't tell me about her last
night because...he's still in love with
her. Dana, what if that's it? He
thought this woman was out of his life,
and now she's back...and he can't stop
thinking about her. That's why he didn't
say he loved me back.

Tara starts to cry. Dana hands her a tissue, patting her on
the shoulder.

DANA
Hold on. Maybe not. Let me think...

Tara wipes her tears, hopeful.

DANA (cont'd)
(long beat)
On the forehead?

Tara lets her head drop back onto the table.
CuT TO:
13.

INT. OFFICE - EVENING

Everyone else has left except for Tara and Dana who walk out
together. They step onto:

ELEVATOR - SAME

DANA
You're going to go back there, act like
nothing is wrong. Act confident. They
sense that. He may just be waiting for
an appropriate time to tell you he loves
you. Don't sweat it. Confidence.

Tara nods to her coach, straightens her coat.

TARA
Confident.

CUT TO:
INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Tara KNOCKS. After a moment Nate answers the door. He
kisses her right away.

TARA
Hey...I thought I'd stop by...on the way
home from work.

NATE
Great. C'mon in...
(beat)
You want something to drink...eat?

Nate heads back to the kitchen. Tara wanders around the
apartment, passing the bedroom. She STOPS in her tracks when
she sees a SUITCASE on the bed, PACKED.

TARA
Nate...where are you going?

Nate appears.

NATE
I tried to tell you before the party...

Nate looks at Tara.

NATE (cont'd)
I have a job interview in San Francisco.
It's for a non-profit...a friend set me
up with these people...I wasn't looking.
14.

TARA
San Francisco? That’s in a different
time zone.

Nate takes Tara's hands in his.

NATE
I haven't even thought this through.
I...I'm just going to see...

He hugs her, but doesn't say any more.

CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - MORNING
Nate hands her a key.

NATE
I'll be gone for a week...if you could
feed Uncle Pussy. Make sure you feed him
twice a day, he'll scavenge if you
don't...make sure he doesn't have people
food.

Nate gestures over to a fat CAT sitting on the window sill.

NATE (cont'd)
Uh...plants are fake...except the orchid
on the table, but I just watered it...uh,
bring in the mail...you don't have to
answer the phone, I'll retrieve my

messages.
TARA
What if you want to call me?
NATE
I'll ring once, hang up, then call right

back.
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Tara is dressed in an oversized sweater of Nate's. She
smells it periodically, staring at two WOMEN selling
rhinestone jewelry on the home shopping network. The BUZZER

rings.

Tara gets up and heads for the intercom.
15.

DANA'S VOICE
Hey, freaklet. It's us.

TARA
I don't feel like going out.

DANA'S VOICE
That's why we're coming in! Hurry up,
it's fucking freezing!

CUT TO:

COUCH - LATER

JAMES, great-looking, tight T-shirt, gay, and RICHARD, her
cubicle mate, standard Gen X uniform of worn corduroys and
bowling shoes, bookend Tara. The television is a Sony flat
screen, huge. Dana and James play a reality video game -
BOXING.

RICHARD
You shouldn’t take it personally, there
are no casual conversations about exes
when it comes to women -—

TARA
We have them all the time -~-

RICHARD
But we’re not sleeping together. Men
know not to share any of that stuff with
women, they remember everything. It’s
amazing, really, the recall. Every
little detail, every name, every single
thing is stored up like ammo, all to be
used for future fights.

TARA
I’m not like that.

RICHARD
You think you’re not like that.

TARA
But...aren’t you curious to learn what
her ex-boyfriends were like?

RICHARD
What, so I can hear about what great sex
they used to have?

JAMES
GET UP, BITCH. BITCH, GET UP!
16.

Dana throws down the controls, reaching for her wine. James
gets up and writhes around in a victory dance.

JAMES (CONT'D)
This deserves a celebration!

He reaches in his bag, presenting a page of stickers to the group.

TARA
Why would we want Bugs Bunny stickers?

JAMES
It's acid, Laura Ingalls.

Tara throws them back at James.

TARA
We’ re not dropping acid on a school
night, you freak.

JAMES
Ecstasy?

TARA
How is it that you never have any money
to go out to eat, but you're a walking
drug lord?

The BUZZER rings.

TARA (cont'd)
Who's that?

JAMES
I invited some people to come up —~-

TARA
We're not having a party here, James.

JAMES
But this apartment is so great -—

TARA
No. No. No --

But as she is saying "no" James is buzzing them up.

JAMES
I can't leave them out in the cold like

that.
17.

TARA
(to Dana)
Did you know about this?

DANA
(yes)
No.
(beat)
But you do have all that alcohol left
over from Nate's party...

CUT TO:

KITCHEN - SAME

Uncle Pussy, the cat, sits by an empty bowl. He leaves the
kitchen, heading for the:

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

He sniffs around the empty pizza boxes, his nose leading him
to James' bag. We see Uncle Pussy find the ACID TABS, and
begin to lick them. PEOPLE arrive, Tara never notices Uncle
Pussy.

DISSOLVE TO:

APARTMENT - LATER

The MUSIC blares. Tara follows a drunk-looking GUEST around,
finally extracting his glass of red wine out of his hand.

She takes a cigarette out of someone else's in one deft
maneuver. We see there are at least a DOZEN PEOPLE here now.

Tara gets to the stereo and turns it off.

TARA
PARTY IS OVER. Good night.

There are various moans and groans, but PEOPLE obey.

TARA (cont'd)
BYE, BYE...A LITTLE FASTER, THANK YOU.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tara puts on Nate's robe. Uncle Pussy lays on the bed. As
Tara passes, Uncle Pussy turns his head left to right to
watch, and then repeats this a dozen times. Tara stops and
stares as Uncle Pussy continues to do this.

TARA
Uncle Pussy?
18.

Uncle Pussy lies on his back, waving a paw back and forth in
front of his face. He does this over and over, first one
paw, then the next...watching the paw “trail.”

TARA (cont’d)
What are you doing?

Tara gasps, covering her face.

TARA (CONT'D)
Uncle Pussy?

Tara looks down on the bed to see only half a page of the
acid left.

TARA (cont'd)
Oh my God! Oh my God!

CUT TO:
EXT. CITY ANIMAL HOSPITAL - DAWN
Establishing.
INT. VET'S OFFICE - DAY

Tara RACES in, straight up the desk. She holds a cat cage
with Uncle Pussy inside. An eager INTERN greets her.

INTERN

Good morning! Did you sign in?
TARA

I have an emergency -- my cat ate a

couple of tabs of acid.

INTERN
Okeydokey, acid as in...

TARA
Drugs. As in hallucinogenic drugs -—

The intern leans down to the cage and waves his hands.

INTERN

He's trippin'? Whoa...that's kinda cool -~
TARA

Please --
INTERN

(snaps back up)
Sorry. Name of pet?
19.

TARA
Uncle Pussy.

INTERN
Soprano fan, uh?
(off Tara’s nod)
Last name?

TARA
Goodman.

He does some rapid typing.

INTERN
No Uncle Pussy Goodman here.

TARA
Well...this is his vet.

INTERN
(typing)
I can do a Pussy search. Yeah...okay, we
have two Pussies. But not all
uncles...oh, yeah, here it is.

Tara nods, relieved.
INTERN (cont'd)
It was under your name, Jessica...
(trouble pronouncing it)
Fuka - Fukunaga?

He looks up at Tara.

TARA
That's not it.

INTERN
2306 West 84th Street?

He slides the piece of paper over to Tara who stares at the
information.

TARA
That's it...that's the address.

INTERN
We have the owner listed as a Jessica
Fukunaga...at that address.

Tara's completely lost, staring at the woman's name.
20.

INTERN (CONT'D)
Oh, here it is, in case of an emergency
contact Nate Goodman, same address.

TARA
This must be her...

The guy waves his hand in front of Tara's face, she fails to
react. He tries to take the piece of paper back. Tara won't
let go.

INTERN
I can update the info --

TARA
I'll do it.

INTERN
Alrighty then.
(looking at Tara)

I didn't think you looked like
a...Fukunaga -- bdum, dum.

Tara looks up from the paper.
INTERN (cont'd)

So...how did this little guy score the

acid anyhow?
Tara freezes him with an ice cold stare.

CUT TO:

INT. NATE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
Tara puts the key in the door and enters Nate’s apartment.
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Tara places the cat cage down gently. Tara opens the door.
Uncle Pussy runs out, and Tara follows the cat with her eyes.

Tara looks around the apartment as if entering it for the
first time. Tara notices the carefully selected art prints
on the walls.

The low mahogany coffee table with a fresh, white orchid
growing out of a ceramic pot.

Linen curtains that match the throw pillows.
21.

Suddenly, it’s so obvious. This is not the apartment of a
lonely bachelor. Tara is overwhelmed by jealousy as she
takes it all in.

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
Nate? Sweetheart, is that you?

Tara turns around slowly to see a beautiful, JAPANESE WOMAN
come out from the bedroom. Her long, black hair hangs below
her waist. She wears a short, red silk kimono.

Nate catches up to her, KISSING HER NECK. They slowly sink
to the floor, making out just inches from Tara.

Tara turns her head, only to see them coming through the
front door with groceries, LAUGHING AND KISSING.

Tara RUNS to the kitchen, and there they are making Sunday
morning waffles together.

She turns and runs past the dining room where they are
painting the walls “drop of green”.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA IS EVERYWHERE.
Tara walks to the balcony, opens the sliding glass doors to
get some fresh air. But there is no escaping it; there
they are, sitting on the chintz pottery barn love seat,
Jessica’s head against Nate’s shoulder. Nate takes her face
in his hands.
NATE

Jessica...I love you. I love you so

much...
Tara shuts the door, leaving the apartment immediately.

CUT TO:

INT. CHAT MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

Tara rushes in, glancing at Dana. Dana runs a finger across
her throat, pointing at her boss's office.

EXT. AUDREY LANFORD'S OFFICE - DAY
Tara knocks on the door, enters.
AUDREY'S OFFICE

Tara gently closes the door behind her.
TARA
I'm so sorry. My boyfriend's cat -—

AUDREY
So many of your excuses start with my
boyfriend. My boyfriend this and my
boyfriend that --

TARA
It was his cat. I'm watching his place
and the cat...got sick. I couldn't --

Audrey puts her hand up. Tara shuts-up.

AUDREY
(putting her hand down)
How old are you?

TARA
22.

AUDREY
Ah...22...what a wonderful age. I
remember what twenty-two felt
like...coénfident, that kind of confidence
where you know exactly what you want and
exactly how to get it. The energy,
enthusiasm, optimism...you haven't been
disappointed by life...yet. It's all
ahead of you. I envy you!

Tara, wary, nods her head.

AUDREY (cont'd)
I know this boyfriend of yours seems to
be the center of your world...but years
from now, believe it or not, when you are
staring across the breakfast table at
someone else...you will wonder why you
ruined a wonderful opportunity at Chat
Magazine for someone who turned out not
to be the one. You still want to write
for this magazine, Tara?

Tara nods again, afraid to speak.
AUDREY (cont’d)
If you want a career in the magazine

industry, work always comes first.

Audrey waits to see that Tara has taken this all in.
23.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
You're officially on probation. You
arrive to this office later than nine or
leave before seven, you’re fired. There
is a line around the block of college
graduates waiting to fill your job...

Tara turns to leave.

AUDREY (cont'd)
Uh...Tara?

Audrey holds up coffee cup without looking.
CUT TO:
INT. DINER - DAY

Tara and Dana sit at the counter, squeezed in with the lunch
crowd. The piece of paper from the vet’s lies between them.

TARA
This must be her...this must be the woman
they were talking about. Why didn't he
tell me he lived with someone? Last year?

Dana takes the piece of paper.

DANA
You could call her. Her work number is
right there.

TARA
Why should I call her?
(beat)
I'll just ask him about it.

DANA
You already tried that, remember?

TARA
I wonder if this is the woman he almost
married...I wonder why it didn't work
out?

DANA
There's one way to find out.

TARA
No, you know, that's totally creepy. I
don't even know what I'd say.
24.

DANA
Why is Nate looking for work in other
cities?

TARA

He's just not happy in his job...
DANA
{looking at Tara)
Or maybe it's more than that...
Tara balls up the piece of paper.
TARA
I'm going to be an adult about this and
just talk to Nate about what I know. Lay
it out.

Dana dangles the wad of paper in front of Tara's face.

DANA
Then...you won't need this.

Tara snatches it back, stuffs it in her purse.

CUT TO:
INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Tara lies in Nate's bed, the phone cradled to her ear.
TARA (INTO PHONE)
I miss you, too. How are you?
CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
Nate stands outside of a restaurant on his cell phone. INTERCUT:

NATE
Damp. Kinda mis -- ble he -- act- lly.

TARA
Oh no...you’re breaking up -—

NATE
Tara...I'm sorry about how I left things.
I meant to talk to you about this job
offer earlier...to include you --

CUT BACK TO:
BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Nate's cell phone cuts out.

TARA
Hello? Nate...hello?

25.

CUT BACK TO:

SAN FRANCISCO - STREET

Nate is unaware that the cell phone has died. The wind is

pretty loud.

NATE
I LOVE YOU, TARA.

Silence.

NATE (cont'd)
Tara?

CUT BACK TO:

INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Tara DUMPS out the contents of her purse.

TARA
Where is his cell phone number, what is
the stupid cell phone number -- ugh --

The phone RINGS. Tara picks it up immediately.

TARA (CONT'D)
Hello?

GUY'S VOICE
Jessica? Hey, it's Gordon. I'm so glad
you guys are back together! I couldn't
make it the other night, but I wanted to
wish the old guy happy birthday!

CUT BACK TO:

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT

BUSY SIGNAL. A group of SUITS sit at a table in front of
Nate. A GUY raps on the glass, pointing to the WAITER who

stands at their table.

CUT BACK TO:
26.

INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Tara begins stuffing back the contents of her purse when she
picks up the CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER: Jessica Fukunaga's
work number in front of her. She stares at it.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CHAT MAGAZINE OFFICE - MORNING

The sheet of paper is now on her desk at work, staring back
at her. Tara hunches over the phone. It rings.

WOMAN'S VOICE
Well Health Center.

TARA
Hi...

Tara looks down at the wrinkled piece of paper from the vets
office.

TARA (cont'd)
Hi...do you have a Jessica Fukunaga
there?

WOMAN'S VOICE
Dr. Fukunaga? Would you like to make an
appointment?

Tara takes this in.

TARA
Doctor...doctor Fukunaga...wow.

WOMAN'S VOICE
I'm sorry, ma'am?

TARA
Yes. I’d like to make an appointment...

CUT TO:

INT. WELL HEALTH CENTER - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Tara sits nervously on the edge of a Doctor’s table, fully
clothed. The door OPENS, and a big, UNATTRACTIVE WOMAN
dressed in blue scrubs ENTERS. Tara's eyes go wide. She
stares at every move the woman makes. The woman picks up a
blood pressure gauge, wrapping it around Tara’s arm.
27.

TARA
(relieved)
Oh...you're just the nurse.

The nurse gives her a "fuck you" look, PUMPING up her arm.

TARA (cont'd)
Ow...that’s tight.

She releases the pressure. Tara sighs, looking around.

The nurse opens a drawer at the base of the table, attaching
the STIRRUPS.

CLOSE ON TARA'S FACE

As she realizes what kind of doctor Jessica Fukunaga is. The
nurse tosses a blue gown at Tara.

TARA
I won't need this...I just have a few
questions --

NURSE
Open to the front.

And with a stern look, she is gone. Tara STARES at the
stirrups.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROOM - LATER

Tara nervously clutching the front of her gown. Tara looks
at her watch, reaching for her clothes. Just as she is about
to bail, DR. JESSICA FUKUNAGA walks in briskly, glancing at
Tara as she picks up the chart. She is pretty, her black
hair cut in a Louise Brooks bob. Her big, brown eyes are
kind, taking everything in.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Hi, I'm Dr. Fukunaga, nice to meet you.

They shake hands.

TARA
Nice to meet you.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
(marking on clipboard)
How are you feeling?
28.

TARA
Great. Really great. I'm just here for
a couple of questions...not an exam, just
a few questions.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
(noting her nervousness)
About...?

Tara looks around the room and spies a poster advertising a
brand of birth control pills.

TARA
Birth control. It’s all so
confusing...the choices.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Well...I can't administer any birth
control without an exam first. What are
you currently using?

Tara stares at Jessica.

TARA
Uh...condoms.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
That's good. And are you currently ina
monogamous relationship?

TARA
Yes.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Well then, if you've both been tested for
HIV, you might want to consider birth
control pills or a diaphragm. When was
your last pelvic exam?

TARA
Really recent...August.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Two months ago?

TARA
Last August.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
That's more than a year. You're due.
(washing her hands)
I’1l do a breast exam first and then ~-
29.

TARA
(bargaining)
How about a breast exam today, and then
I'll make an appointment for more later?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
The breast exam comes with the package,
we usually don't separate them.

TARA
It's just...I'm on my lunch break and -—
'y

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Then let’s get started. Just loosen your

gown.

Jessica Fukunaga approaches Tara, she complies, undoing her
robe. Jessica Fukunaga places her hand on her breast. Tara

JUMPS about a foot off the table.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA (cont'd)
Sorry, are my hands cold?

TARA
A little.

Tara sighs, looking the other way as Jessica Fukunaga
performs the breast exam.

Jessica Fukunaga steps back from Tara.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Everything’s fine. Why don't you lie
down, scoot to the end of the table and
put your feet in the stirrups.

(beat)
You can keep your socks on.

TARA
(sotto voce)
Oh good.

Tara takes a deep breath, STARING at the STIRRUPS. She
closes her eyes and quickly lies down.

TARA (cont'd)
I just took my cat into the vet
yesterday...do you have a cat?

Jessica Fukunaga swivels the lamp around, sitting on a stool in
front of Tara. She places a paper blanket over Tara’s legs.
30.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
I used to.

TARA
So...what happened?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Can you spread your legs a little wider?
I...had to leave him with my boyfriend.

TARA
So, you two aren't together anymore?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
No...my residency ended my relationship
with both my cat and my boyfriend.

Taking some instruments off the cart.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA (cont'd)
I’m going to use this to separate the
walls of your --

TARA
Whatever you have to do.
(looks to the ceiling)
So, do you miss him? Do you think about
him?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
You're going to feel some pressure...just
relax.
(looking at Tara)
I do miss him...I wonder if he would
still remember me?

Tara frowns.

TARA
You lived with him, of course he'd still
remember you ——

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
The cat...not the boyfriend.

Jessica Fukunaga stands up, applying some KY to the end of
her gloved fingers. She looks at Tara over her knees,
concentrating.
31.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA (CONT'D)
I'm just going to make sure everything is
alright, you'll feel some
pressure...yeah, he was a great cat. His
name was Uncle Pussy -~

TARA
After the Sopranos.

Jessica nods.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Yeah, and my boyfriend at the time
thought because of my profession...

TARA
Oh, yeah.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
That it would be an appropriate name. So, he
called him Uncle Pussy first, then --

cut TO:

OUTSIDE OF EXAMINING ROOM

Another PATIENT is led to the room next door. As they pass
the room they can hear -—

JESSICA FUKUNAGA’S VOICE
Big pussy, little pussy, sweet pussy, and
just plain pussy.

The NURSE shrugs, opening the door for her.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - SAME

TARA
Oh, that’s cute. So, did you want to
leave --

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
No, I didn’t want to leave Pussy behind.

TARA
Not your pussy, I’m asking about the guy,
did he ask you to leave?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
No, it was mutual --
32.

TARA
Were you engaged first?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
No, we were never engaged.

TARA
Oh. You’re sure?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
I think I would remember the whole down
on one knee thing, no, I was busy...he
was busy.

TARA
So, you were never madly in love?

Jessica shakes her head.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
I was very fond of him...but I guess it
was just...convenient. JI mean, we were
fond of each other --

TARA
But, you must have said those words, I
love you, right? You can't share a bed
and a life and, and a cat without love,
right?

Jessica Fukunaga quickly takes off her gloves, looks at Tara
like she's insane.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
You can get dressed now.

TARA
He might still be pining away after you.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
(exasperated)
Last I heard he was dating a model. I'm
sure he's recovered.

DANA (O.S.)
A model.

CUT TO:
INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

Tara nods. Tara and Dana sit on the floor, the box of PHOTOS
in front of them. ‘Tara manically rummages through them.
33.

TARA
They're all beautiful...they could all be
models --

DANA

You don't have a name?

TARA
Just...model.

DANA

Let's assume the worst. Hot, sexy,

perfect body and skin, you know...our

worst nightmare.
Tara DEVOURS one after another.
PHOTO OF A WOMAN with long, dark curly hair standing on a
beach holding two coconuts in front of her breasts. Her
smile is wide, beautiful.
Nate and a pretty REDHEAD golfing.
THIN BLONDE IN A BIKINI
THIN BLONDE IN FRONT OF CHRISTMAS TREE
THIN BLONDE, THIN BLONDE, THIN BLONDE

TARA
This must be her...

Dana leans over her shoulder.

DANA
She's a nightmare, alright. Is there a
name on the back of any of these photos?

TARA
No.

Dana picks up a few more photos out of the box -- a LITTLE
BLACK BOOK sits nestled in the pile. Dana pounces on it.

DANA
So this is why you didn't invite any of
the exes...the infamous little black
book, and look, it literally is his
little black book.

Tara snatches it away.
TARA
Don’t, we shouldn’t be doing this.

Dana snatches it back again.

DANA
You've already gone to third base with
one of his ex-girlfriends --

TARA
A medical exam that you pushed me into --

DANA
You've gone as far as you can go, so
what's stopping you?

Tara sits back.

TARA
Because I don't see how it's going to
help me keep Nate.

DANA
(dangling book)
Because they hold the answers. These
women are his past and your possible
future. What if this woman did simple
things to make him happy? Things you
aren't doing.

TARA
Like?

DANA

Sex...cooking...things that are within
your reach.

(pausing dramatically)
They hold the answers...think of this
book as the Rosetta Stone, once you meet
his girlfriends, you will be able to
speak his language...interpret every word
and gesture.

Tara leafs through the worn, black book.

DANA (CONT'D)
There’s a woman within those pages who
made Nate love her so much he wanted to
marry her. A woman he still thinks
about. Don’t you want to know why it
ended?

34.

CUT TO:
35.

THE PHONE
Tara stares at it, Dana paces behind her.

TARA
How am I going to find her? There must
be dozens of women in this book.

DANA
I think you'll be able to tell pretty
quickly...like with Jessica Fukunaga.

TARA
But...what do I say?

DANA
Maybe honesty...

TARA
Hi, I'm Nate Goodman's current girlfriend
and I just have a few questions about
your relationship?

DANA
I see your point...okay, I know, you can
pretend to be calling about a
survey...like those sex surveys for Cosmo
except you can pretend you're calling
from CHAT MAGAZINE with a survey about
women and the men they’ve loved! That's
perfect. Oh, oh dial --

TARA
I'm not doing it.
DANA
I'll do it. We’1ll just start with page

one.

And before Tara can stop her she dials and then hands the
phone to Tara, leaning into the receiver to listen.

TARA
But I thought you --

ANSWERING MACHINE
(singing)
Please leave a message after the tone, if
you don't leave a message, we won't know
you phoned.

Tara HANGS up.
36.

TARA
Answering machine.

DANA
So you can call back later --

TARA
It's a sign --

The PHONE RINGS. Tara and Dana JUMP, startled. Dana lunges
for it. Tara slaps her hand away, Dana reaches with the
other hand, Tara YANKS Dana's hair, Dana grabs a fist full of
Tara's hair.

DANA
LET GO -- get the phone ~-
TARA
YOU LET GO -- Nate gave me a code,

that's not the code --

The machine picks up.

NATE'S VOICE ON OUTGOING
Please leave a message.

BEEEEEEEEP -- Tara and Dana, still holding each other's hair,
stand still to listen.

WOMAN'S VOICE

(raspy/sexy/accent)
Hi...Nate, are you there? Look, I know
you're there...T have caller I.D...c'mon,
pick up. Typical.

(sighs)
I have to say I'm surprised you called.
And curious. I...really can't imagine
why you called. Maybe it’s because
you’re in between relationships and
horny, is that it? Okay...I'm home. Oh,
there's an opening Saturday night in
Soho, at Gallery 57...you should come.
Okay, bye-bye.

Click. Silence. Tara and Dana release their hold on each
other. Dana holds up the book, looks at the number.

DANA
That was Pippa Anders.

CUT TO:
37.

INT. OFFICE - SAN FRANCISCO

A plush office with all the trimmings and a view of the The
Golden Gate Bridge. Nate is going through a rigorous
interview, but looks completely distracted.

BOSS MAN
May I ask why you are seeking a position
in the non-profit field when you will
never earn the salary you currently take
in?

NATE
Because...this isn’t about money for me
anymore. I mean, money is important, but
now it would be about --

Nate’s CELL PHONE RINGS. He tries to ignore it -

NATE (cont’d)
It would be about...raising money for
others -~

The Boss Man stares at Nate’s jacket pocket as it continues
to ring.

NATE (cont’d)
I’m sorry, I forgot --

BOSS MAN
No, please, go ahead.

Nate grabs the phone, swivelling his chair away.

NATE (INTO PHONE)
Hello...Jessica? What are you -- are you
kidding? We’ve been over this. We
agreed that I was the best one to take
care of him.

(raising his voice)
When you were working ninety hour work
weeks and then moved out, that’s - he’s
comfortable with me. I can’t talk now,
I’m in a job interview.

Nate hangs up, swivels around.

NATE (cont’d)
Sorry, really. Custody battle.

BOSS MAN

(sympathetic)
Your child?
—

38.

NATE
No, a cat.

The man looks disgusted.
BOSS MAN
I’m more of a dog man, myself. Okay, so

you want to work in non-profit -~

NATE
Yes. I...I want to help people. I...I
like people, and I think people...
(searching)
Who need people --
BOSS MAN
(singing)
Are the luckiest people in the world.
(beat)
Big Barbara fan.

Nate stops, surprised, laughs. The Boss Man joins him until
Nate’s cell phone begins to ring again.

BOSS MAN (cont'd)
Why don't you take five son and come back
when you're ready.
CUT TO:
HALLWAY - DAY
Nate picks up the phone, resumes SCREAMING.

CUT TO:

EXT. GALLERY 57 ~ NIGHT

Lots of “wearing all black types” spill out onto the street,
smoking. Dana and Tara ENTER:

GALLERY - NIGHT

Techno blares throughout the space, throngs of PEOPLE move in
and out of rooms displaying art. Tara searches the space.

TARA
How am I going to know who she is?

DANA
I brought some pictures.

Dana produces a few photos. Tara sifts through them.

 
39.

TARA
This just seems...impossible.

DANA
C’mon, we’re just here to look at art

like everyone else.
They walk into:

GALLERY A - NIGHT

Lots of paintings on the walls. They wander around, looking
more at the people than the art.

TARA
She could be here...right now, watching
us.

They wander into the next

NEXT SPACE

PENISES. A room filled with plastic, sculpted, towering
multi-colored penises. They walk to the wall and look at the

artists’ name.
DANA
(grabbing Tara)
This is her. This is her stuff!

Tara looks around the room. They walk past a fish tank with
motorized penises zig-zagging through the choppy waters.

DANA (cont’d)
It’s kind of fun.

TARA
The woman is obsessed with penises...

Dana stops in front of a bobbing metal see-saw penis.
DANA
Don’t be a prude.
(nodding towards see-saw)
C'mon, let's try it.
Tara grabs her hand, leads her away.

TARA
She’s here...somewhere...

They turn around to face a series of bronzed penises on the
wall. Each placard has a name beneath it.
40.

Dana clamps her hand over her mouth. There, in the center of
the display is NATE’S PENIS. Tara checks it out, yep, it’s
his.

TARA (cont’d)
Don’t look at it --

DANA
It’s art, Jesse Helms. TI have a right.
(tries to turn her head)
You never told me he was that --

Tara starts to drag her towards the exit.

TARA
C’mon, we’re going.

The sound of CLAPPING and CHEERS as a WOMAN enters the
gallery. She is dressed in a cowgirl outfit and fishnets.
Her maroon hair tucked beneath a black cowboy hat. A few
“bravos" from friends, she bows. This is PIPPA Anders.

DANA
That’s her...

Tara watches her carefully. Pippa scans the room, watching
the ENTRANCE like a hawk.

TARA
She’s looking for Nate.

CUT TO:

BAR AREA - LATER

It's boxed wine and mini quiches, but it's free, and it's
where all the artists are hanging out, talking to prospective
buyers and fans.

Dana flirts with a guy who is covered in tattoos, they
clearly are getting along.

Tara watches Pippa from the wings. Pippa hangs with a GUY.
Various people come up and give their congratulations. Tara
nudges her way through the crowd, waiting for Pippa to grant
her audience. Pippa leans into the guy, giggling.

TARA
Hi, excuse me...I just wanted to say I
thought your work was really great.

Pippa turns and gives Tara the once-over.
Al.

PIPPA
But let me guess...they don't really go
with your decor.

The Guy she's with laughs.
TARA
Uh...I'm not here to buy, I just wanted
to ask where the idea --

Pippa's glance slides off Tara and fixates on someone behind her.

PIPPA
JAKE -- Hey, honey!

A new GROUP approaches, all lovey-dovey with Pippa - Tara is
pushed out of the way.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Tara and Dana stand outside. They are joined by the guy Dana
hooked up with.

DANA
Okay, don't wait up.

TARA
Have fun.

They jump in a waiting cab and are gone. Tara sighs, about
to hail her own cab when she sees Pippa stumble out of the
warehouse, clearly drunk, with another GUY. They argue.

PIPPA
I'm not ready to leave, it's my fucking
opening, I want to stay --

GUY
You just said you wanted to go —~

PIPPA
Well, now I want to stay.

The GUY hails a cab, he pulls her towards the curb.

PIPPA (cont'd)
Rick, let go --

But he doesn't, in fact, he shakes her roughly, holding on
tight so she can't get away.
42.

Pippa attempts to kick at him, but she's no match for this
guy. A cab pulls up. She tries to TWIST out of his grasp,
but he pulls her hair.

GUY
Just get in --

TARA
LET HER GO --

The Guy looks over at Tara.

GUY
Mind your own business, bitch.

Tara, as if in a trance, steps forward. She PULLS a STUN GUN
out of her purse - holds it out in front of her.

TARA
I'll use this --

The GUY turns around slowly, still holding onto Pippa's hair.

GUY
You’ re not going to use that --

TARA
My Dad gave it to me for Christmas, he’d
be disappointed with me if I didn’t.

The guy sees the zapping electricity and the look of steely
determination on Tara's face. Clearly, she's not backing off.

The Guy laughs, but let’s go of Pippa, backing away -~

GUY
I’1l see you, later.

He jumps into the cab and it pulls away. Pippa stares at
Tara, her mascara running down her face.

PIPPA
(shaking)
You better put that away.

They look at one another, bursting into nervous laughter.
They calm down, Pippa puts out a shaking hand.

PIPPA (cont’d)
Thank you.

CUT TO:
43.

EXT. NATE’S APARTMENT - ENTRY WAY ~ MORNING

Tara and Dana walk past the DOORMAN with a nod. Tara carries
a grocery bag, Dana a tray of coffees.

TARA
I don’t know where I got the adrenaline
rush, or the courage, it was like when
you hear about those women whose babies
are trapped beneath cars and then get
that super human strength -—

DANA
You lifted a car?

TARA
No. But this was a big guy. And now
Pippa and I are going to have dinner. I
have to admit, I was amazing. And
there’s this bond now between us...I feel
like we could really be friends.

DANA
But, is she the love of Nate’s life?

TARA
Probably not, but I’1l find out stuff,
maybe she’1l know who this model was. I
don’t know, I’m almost afraid to say it,
but meeting his ex-girlfriends is easy --

Tara looks outside to see JESSICA FUKUNAGA talking her way
past the DOORMAN. She carries an empty cat cage.

TARA (cont’d)
Oh my God. It’s Jessica Fukunaga -~

Tara looks around as the elevator door finally opens. Tara
pushes Dana

INSIDE ELEVATOR

Tara manically pushes the CLOSE button. The doors come
together and Tara sighs with relief. Suddenly, a FOOT jams
into the door. Jessica Fukunaga steps on. Tara, too late,
lifts her grocery bag in front of her face.

Jessica glances at Tara for a beat, then turns forward.
After a moment, she turns back.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
You look really familiar...oh, oh, you
were -~
44,

Tara lowers the groceries.

TARA
A patient, hi, how are you?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Good, wait, so you live here? I saw your
form, it didn’t list --

TARA
I’m moving. My friend lives here.
They all nod, glancing ahead. Jessica sees the only floor
lit is number 3.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Wait, you live on the third floor? I
used to live on the third floor.

Tara pushes Dana slightly.

TARA
She lives with her boyfriend...on the

third floor.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Oh...God, this is so embarrassing. It’s
not, Nate Goodman by any chance?

TARA
Oh my God --
(shoving Dana)
What a coincidence!

DANA
(rubbing her arm)
Yes. Well, I don’t know what to say ——

Dana shoots Tara a look.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Nate’s not back from his business trip?

Dana looks at Tara, then back to Jessica Fukunaga. The
elevator doors open. They all step out to:

THE THIRD FLOOR

DANA
No...no, still away. So, why are you

stopping by?
45.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
I know this is a really weird question,
but could I come in and see the cat?

Tara looks down and stares at the EMPTY CAT CAGE.

TARA
No --

They all look at Tara.
TARA (cont’d)
He’s not here. Remember, remember how he

is out being groomed? He’s a long hair —-

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
I know. Oh. Well.

Tara stares at Jessica’s cat carrier.

TARA
So, why the cat cage?

Jessica looks down at it guiltily.
JESSICA FUKUNAGA
(handing it to Dana)
It’s silly to have a cat cage...and no
cat. I just thought I’d...give it to
you.

Dana accepts the cage. Jessica backs away.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA (cont’d)
Don’t tell Nate I stopped by.

They watch her run to the stairwell. Tara puts her hand over
her heart.

TARA
Was she crying?

CUT TO:
INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Pippa downs an oyster out of the shell. Everything she does
is sensual.
PIPPA
In an alley, in the back of a cab, in the
movie theater on Beaker street, the
women's bathroom of TGI Fridays, the
diaper changing station...we broke it and
every time I go in there I feel guilty,
it's still on the floor.

TARA
He likes TGI Fridays?

Pippa shrugs.

PIPPA
(offering her sushi)
Sea urchin?

Tara shakes her head.

TARA
All those public places? He liked that?

PIPPA
Look to gay men if you ever have a
question about what straight men like.
Gay men like hot looking guys with
perfect bodies, right?

TARA
Yeah...I guess.

PIPPA
Well, so do straight men. Even ugly
little trolls that don’t deserve to see
the light of day like their women to be
hot. And sex...gay men love sex in
public places...hello, road side stops,
public bathrooms, theaters, parks? You
sprinkle in a few new tricks like that
into your relationship and that man is
yours.

TARA
Wow. But you’re no longer with that
guy...uh...?

PIPPA
Nate?
TARA
(nodding)

Were you engaged?

 

46.
47.

~ PIPPA
Engaged? Ha! He called me the other
night, probably for a quickie. That’s
the problem with being great in bed, you
often get the lonely late night call just
to see if you’re up for it.

TARA
Has he called you for those?

Pippa thinks about it.

PIPPA
No...come to think of it.
(sighs)
He was different. I guess he was
different.

Pippa throws back another shot of saki. She suddenly looks
very sad and very drunk.

PIPPA (CONT'D)
In fact, he broke up with me because he
didn't feel right sleeping with me when
it wasn't emotionally going anywhere.
a Well, whose fault was that? I wanted it
to go somewhere, it wasn't me who wasn't
moving it forward --

TARA
Maybe it was for the best --

PIPPA
Maybe it's what ruined my life.
(tears up)
There was no closure. It was just over.

Tara awkwardly pats her hand.

TARA
You’re so talented, Pippa...you could use
these feelings in your work...create the
closure that you need.

Trying to focus on Tara.

PIPPA
Yeah. ..maybe.
(sighs)
Do you know what it's like to love a guy
so much...do everything you can to keep
him, and then he leaves you?
48.

TARA
I...can imagine it.

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Pippa leans on Tara, unable to stand on her own. Tara opens
the door to the cab, gently depositing Pippa.

TARA

Okay, tell the driver where you live.
PIPPA

Where?
TARA

I...don't know, where do you live, Pippa?

PIPPA
In that big place...by that thing.

Tara stares at Pippa for a long time. Pippa starts laughing.

Tara drags Pippa into the apartment. She attempts to be
quiet, but Pippa drunkenly stumbles around, pulling down a
lamp as they enter.

Dana suddenly appears in pajamas.

DANA
Oh no, no, Tara...this isn't good.

TARA
She doesn't remember where she lives. I
had no choice.

Dana rights the lamp, Pippa twirls around, knocking it to the
floor before she lands beside it.

DANA
This was my Grandmother’s, please.

TARA
Just stay there, Pippa. Don’t move.

Tara quickly runs around the apartment, taking down photos of
Nate. She stashes them in the hall closet, Dana follows.
49,

She’s not a puppy, Tara, you, you can’t
have her stay here. That’s crazy —~

TARA
(whispers)
I can’t take her to Nate’s. Right?

Tara walks back to Pippa, dragging her towards her bedroom.

DANA
Not cool. Totally un-cool.

Dana watches Tara struggle with Pippa's limp form, sighs, and
then pitches in. They drag Pippa into

TARA’S BEDROOM
Depositing her on the bed.

DANA
Well...did you learn anything?

TARA
Yeah, he likes to have sex in public
Nae places -~

DANA PIPPA
Really? Who doesn't?

Tara takes off Pippa’s cowboy boots, throws a blanket on top
of her, shutting the door.

TARA (CONT'D)
Thanks, Dana. I knew you’d understand --

DANA
Whoa, whoa, whoa...where are you going?

TARA
I’ve got to go back to Nate’s place, feed
Uncle Pussy.

Dana blocks the front door with her body.
DANA
You’re not leaving her here with me. She

could be a total fucking psycho.

TARA
~ She’s not.
50.

DANA
Okay, I think this is officially getting
out of hand. Today with pretending to be
Nate’s girlfriend and then --

Tara pries Dana away from the door.

TARA
You encouraged me to do this, you’ve got
to help me out here just a little.
(beat)
When you leave for work tomorrow, just
get her up and tell her she has to leave.
I’m sorry I have to do this, but I can’t
starve Uncle Pussy.
Tara kisses Dana on the cheek and bolts.

Yeah, I was just --

NATE
Is Uncle Pussy alright?

CUT BACK TO:

INT. NATE’S APARTMENT

TARA
Yes...why do you keep asking --

NATE

Has anyone come by and tried to take
him...?
Tara is

silent a moment.

NATE (cont’d)
Tara?

TARA
What are you talking about?

NATE
It’s just I’ve retrieved some strange
messages from...someone, and she said she
met you, but it didn’t sound like you -—

TARA
I...have no idea what you’re talking
about. Nate, what are you talking about?

NATE
It’s...an old girlfriend, she wants Uncle
Pussy back. It could get ugly.

Tara sits up straight in bed.

TARA
I’ll take care of it.

NATE
What?

Tara gets out of bed, begins pacing.

TARA
Time will take care of it --

NATE
This cell phone service sucks --

TARA
What?

NATE
(beat)
I said...I miss you so much.

TARA
When are you coming back?

NATE
I was going to come back early, but my
firm wants me to check out a company in
Los Angeles. You’re not mad?

51.
52.

TARA
No...just...take whatever time you need,
everything here is fine.
(beat)
Nate...are you happy with our sex life?

NATE
Yes...aren't you?

TARA
Yes...but...is there anything else you
want to do...would you like to...that I'm
not doing...I don't know, try something
different?

NATE'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME
He closes his laptop, the bed is littered with paper work.

NATE
Are you trying to torture me, here? I
haven't seen you in days, I'm all alone
in a hotel room. I hope you're bringing
this up because you want to have phone
sex.

CUT BACK TO:

TARA IN BED

TARA
Would you like that?

NATE
Uh...would you like to...?

Nate lies back down on his bed. Tara giggles nervously.

TARA
How do we start?

CUT TO:
INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - MORNING
Rows and rows of cats in cages. Tara points to one. The LAB

TECH gets it out of its cage. It is a long hair cat, similar
to Uncle Pussy. Tara holds it, kisses him.
53.

INT. WELL HEALTH CENTER - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - MORNING

Tara stands at the counter, pushing it towards the
RECEPTIONIST, a note attached to the cage. The Receptionist
pushes it back.

RECEPTIONIST

This is a doctor’s office, not a vet -~
TARA

But Dr. Fukunaga is expecting this, trust

me -~
Tara begins to walk away.

RECEPTIONIST
You cannot leave this here -~

TARA
There’s a note, believe me, she will want

this cat. Now, I have to go back to
work.

Tara RUNS out before she can catch her.
ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Tara repeatedly presses the down button, when Jessica
Fukunaga appears carrying the cat cage.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA

Uh...excuse me, excuse me -- what is this
all about?

TARA
Oh...hey, I just dropped off the cat for
you --

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
Why?

TARA
I know you were pretty upset about your
old cat, so I found the same cat that you
described...uh, I work part time for
animal rescue, that cat was going to be --
(draws hand across throat)
So, enjoy --

Jessica Fukunaga looks completely confused.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
I don’t know if I can take this...uh..

TARA
Tara --

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
(saying name over)
Tara...oh, Ms. O’Connor, I was to call
you today...you need to make another
appointment. Your Pap Smear came back
abnormal.

Tara turns to face her.

TARA
Abnormal? What, what does that mean?

CUT TO:
INT. JESSICA FUKUNAGA’S OFFICE ~ DAY
Jessica gets out her file.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
It’s often times a lab error...

TARA
And other times?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
It’s probably a lab error.

TARA
Oh my God...do you mean cancer?

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
It could be just a clump of pre-cancerous
cells. If caught this early it shouldn’t
pose a risk --

TARA
Oh my God. I’m going to die.

JESSICA FUKUNAGA
You're not going to die. And please, you
can take the cat back --

TARA
Please...

Tara takes the sweet cat out of his cage, puts him on her lap.
TARA (cont’d)

It’s my dying wish that you take this
cat. He needs a good home.

The cat nuzzles Jessica. She melts, hugging him back

INT. CHAT MAGAZINE OFFICE - TARA’S DESK — MORNING

Tara rushes into the office. Dana GLARES at her, Tara walks
past, oblivious.

DANA
She’s still there.

Tara stops, backtracks.

TARA
Who’s still there?

DANA
Pippa...still there. Did you give her a
key?

TARA
Uh...I told her to just put it under the
mat. I/’1l...

Tara looks over and sees Audrey yelling at someone on the
phone.

TARA (CONT'D)
I’1l go back at lunch and make sure she’s
out.

DANA

If you still have a job.

OUTSIDE AUDREY’S OFFICE - MORNING
Tara knocks lightly, then enters.
AUDREY LANFORD'S OFFICE - SAME
Tara ENTERS Audrey’s office. It looks out over Times Square.
The view from the window behind her shows the billboard in
progress. TINY MEN hang from scaffolding, finishing the
work. Half of the model’s face eerily stares ahead.

TARA

Uh...Audrey...I’m sorry I was late, I had
a doctor’s appointment that ran over.
56.

AUDREY
(still typing)
You're only twenty minutes late. Why
bother apologizing at all?

Tara winces, watching her continue to type. The phone rings,
Tara reaches for it, but Audrey beats her to it.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Audrey Lanford's office. Oh, Henry,
hello...it’s me, Audrey.

Audrey swivels her chair away from Tara. Tara walks back to:
HER DESK
Where Pippa sits behind it. Tara gasps, surprised.

PIPPA
Hey.

Tara casually takes a framed photo of Nate off the edge of
the desk, pocketing it.

TARA
How did you know...

PIPPA
You mentioned you worked here.
(beat)
To thank you for letting me crash, I
brought some things to help you out with
your sexual problems.

Pippa says it rather loudly. Dana stares at the whole thing
from across the way, as does a few of her office neighbors.

TARA
(whispering)
I really don’t think this is the place --

Pippa stands, dumping a bunch of SEX TOYS onto Tara’s desk.

PIPPA
Okay...this boyfriend of yours. Does he
like you to put your finger up his --

TARA

Pippa - please.
(glancing around)
I’ve never done that.
S57.

PIPPA
Oh, honey. Guys love that...remember the
whole gay sex conversation we had? Love
it.

Pippa dangles a dayglow, wiggly plastic thing.

PIPPA (cont'd)
This looks like a soap dish, but I’m
telling you, have him wear it and it will
drive you crazy.

Audrey comes up to the desk, peers over it.

TARA
I’m coming --

PIPPA
You will once you start using these -—

TARA
Uh...Audrey, I’m working on a story idea
for the magazine about...
(looking down at sex toys)
Pleasing your man by...pleasing yourself.

Audrey turns on her heel.

TARA (CONT'D)
Sorry, very busy here Pippa...uh, I’11
talk to you later?

PIPPA
Sure, just, thanks for letting me crash.

Pippa walks away. Dana gets up and stares at her back as she
leaves. Dana yells over to Tara’s retreating form.

DANA
Those better not be my shoes she’s
wearing - can she afford Manolo Blahniks?

Dana gets up and tries to catch her before the elevator doors
close.

AUDREY’S OFFICE - SAME

Tara is about to sit down when she looks out the window to
see that the final piece of the Calvin Klein billboard jigsaw
puzzle is now in place. Staring back at her is the WOMAN
FROM NATE'S PHOTOS - Tara GASPS, dropping her coffee and
spilling it all over Audrey's desk
58.

AUDREY
This desk is teak -- my papers -~

Tara SWIPES everything off the desk top and onto the FLOOR.
Completely rattled she takes off her sweater and begins to
mop up the mess. The phones start ringing off the hook.

Dana walks in.

DANA
Dan Albright on line two -- is that my
sweater?

TARA

I'll get it dry-cleaned.
Dana gives her an icy stare and retreats.

TARA (cont'd)
(after Dana)
Sorry --

Sorry.

AUDREY
Just...get out.

TARA
But I can --

AUDREY

Tara leads Dana over to the window. They stare out together.

DANA

TARA

Tara extracts a PHOTO from her pocket, holding it up to the
glass.

DANA
Nate's model.
59.

TARA
I’m sure this is the one he was in love
with. Look at her...she’s perfect.

Dana pulls Tara away from the window.

DANA
Don’t you think you’ve learned enough?
It was an experiment, it didn’t work.

TARA
But Dana, I haven’t met the woman he was
in love with yet. Once I talk to her, I
don’t need to meet any more of his ex-
girlfriends.

Tara turns, stares straight into the model’s face.

TARA (cont’d)
That’s her. I feel it.

MOVER #1
You can’t hold it by the shaft, hold it by the

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

GORGEOUS MODELS work the catwalk. The most outrageous
fashions from the world's top designers.

BULLPEN

MEDIA MONGRELS climb over each other, hungrily snapping at
the models who pass by, jostling Tara and Dana about.

TARA
I don't stand a chance. If she is asking

about Nate and wants him back, I'm
through.

Dana, still pissed, stares straight ahead at a MODEL.

DANA
You’re right. Let’s hope she doesn’t.

TARA
Really...is that what you think?

Dana shrugs.
61.

TARA (cont’d)
I’m going to lose him. I’m going to lose
him to a woman who is perfect.

Dana finally looks at Tara, sees she’s falling apart.

DANA
Look at that model, she looks like she's
straight from a concentration camp.
These women are not perfect, and neither
is this Kate Cates.

The Model is now close enough to hold onto.
DANA (cont'd)
See, it's all airbrush. Bags under her
eyes, all sunken in, skin is sallow...her
looks says "I'm starving, please feed

me". I'm surprised flies aren't buzzing
around her head.

This makes Tara smile.

TARA
You're right -- you're so right!

An ERUPTION OF APPLAUSE. The BEST saved for last...

A DOZEN WHITE DOVES fly from back stage and from it emerges ~~
KATE CATES

IN A SEE-THROUGH DRESS, a thin gold wire birdcage descends
from around her Disney-eighteen-inch waist. Wild flowers

braided through her golden locks. She is THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN ALIVE.

TARA
As if she'd swallowed a Molotov cocktail.

DANA
Ohhhhh, see, that can't be real.

Tara swallows hard as Kate Cates approaches. Squinting -
looking for flaws. NOT FINDING ANY. VENUS REBORN.

TARA
(whispering)
No...she's flawless.

A. VOLLEY OF FLASHBULBS. Kate Cates caught in an electric
storm of media adulation. She winks, and sashays away.
62.

The spell is momentarily broken. Dana looks at her friend.
Tara is crushed.

Dana grabs Tara's arm, crossing her eyes, she sticks out her
tongue pretending to choke. Tara looks at her quizzically.

DANA
Dumb as a post.
(winks)
Betcha.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - BACKSTAGE - LATER
Tara and Dana watch KATE CATES answer reporters’ questions.
In French.
Italian.
Japanese.
TARA
She's a supermodel with Einstein's brain.
Why did he let her go?
DANA
I’m sure she knows a few pat answers in
different languages, that doesn’t make
her a genius.

(beat)
What's that clucking noise she's making?

TARA
I think it's Swahili.
DANA
You better go talk to her --
TARA
She's in the middle of a press
conference ——

You want to be a reporter, here's your
chance.

Tara looks at what Dana is waving. It says AUDREY LANFORD,
CHAT MAGAZINE.

TARA
You took Audrey's pass, oh my God, I'm so
fired --
63.

Tara takes the press pass and steps forward but is halted by
several MEATY BODYGUARDS. Kate's MANAGER steps in the way.

MANAGER
Kate Cates is through giving interviews,

Bodyguards ESCORT Kate Cates away.

KATE SLIPS OUT of the back of the hotel and into a stretch.

They peel out from the curb.

glamorous club.

Tara stares at the expensive boutiques and glamorous hot
spots that they pass — expecting the limo to pull over at any
minute...

The limo finally pulls over to:

EXT. MANHATTAN MONTESSORI PRE-SCHOOL - LATER

Tara gets out of the cab and crosses the street just as Kate
Cates disappears inside. Tara stops, surprised, looking at
the sign for the pre-school one more time before entering.

INT. MANHATTAN MONTESSORI PRE-SCHOOL ~ LATER

CHILDREN run everywhere. TEACHERS give chase. PARENTS pick
up their PRODIGIES.

Tara SEARCHES, spying Kate talking to a TEACHER in the corner
of the room. She holds a LITTLE BOY who struggles in her
arms.
64.

He drops to the ground playing with a Tonka truck, making
"yrrrrooooommm vrrrooooom" noises.

Tara DROPS to the floor and crawls through the maze of toys
and remaining children. She scoots past Kate's child, stops
and takes a good look. He looks like a MINIATURE NATE.

Tara wildly looks around, there's no place to HIDE. Spying a
large PLASTIC TOWNHOUSE with a roof, she crawls into it. She
just fits, completely hidden within the structure.

MRS. WILLIAMS (0.S.)
He's too much for us to handle ——

Tara opens a shutter, peering up at --
KATE CATES AND TEACHER

Kate towers over the tiny troll of a woman, yet looks
vulnerable. The TROLL calmly sips a glass of water.

KATE
He's a smart little boy, he just needs --

MRS. WILLIAMS
More attention. We agree.

KATE
Look, it's really hard raising him on my
own...

TARA

EYES grow to the size of SAUCERS. Hearing a light knocking,
Tara opens the opposite shutter. Baby Nate holds out his
cupped hand.

Tara places her finger to her lips: "shhhhhh".

MRS. WILLIAMS (0.S.)
We're finding it difficult to control
him. We found him in the bathroom with a
set of magic markers drawing shapes onto
Lucy and Sarah's bottoms.

Kate BURSTS out laughing.

MRS. WILLIAMS (O.S.) (CONT'D
I'm glad you find that so amusing.

BABY NATE holds out his curled fist again. Tara sticks her
open palm out through the tiny window.

BABY NATE

He performs the hand-off, Tara looks down:
A GOLDFISH WRIGGLES IN HER HAND.

Tara looks up to see Baby Nate standing on two chairs and a
stack of Encyclopedias, EXTRACTING yet another fish from the
tank.

Tara opens the opposite window, looks up at Kate Cates.
MRS. WILLIAMS
...He said he was giving them tattoos

just like his mothers'. Now it's not my
place to judge -—

Kate crosses the room to her son.

KATE
Oh, but you already have.

Kate takes her son off of the tier of chairs, looks back.
KATE (cont'd) .
You know what, I don't want my son in
such a limiting environment. There are
plenty of schools in this city.

Tara, still peeking out from within the confines of the
playhouse watch Kate and Baby Nate leave. Tara looks up

Tara slips the live goldfish into the glass. Turning, she
looks up to see...

Baby Nate waving "goodbye".

I scared you...oh my God, Pippa, what is

PIPPA
I had a fight with the guy who I share

arranged --

TARA
No, no, no, no. You can’t...has Dana

PIPPA
I don’t think so...she called, there’s a
message on the machine saying she’d be
out late.

TARA
Are you wearing her clothes?

PIPPA
I couldn’t get back home --

TARA
Change immediately - quick, grab a penis,
we can’t have this stuff here when she
gets back.

PIPPA
I had to pay two moving men to get this
stuff here --

TARA
Will it fit in my room?

PIPPA
You can’t pile them up -—

Just then Dana walks in with James. She stares at
everything, then to Tara.

DANA
This shit can’t go on any longer --

TARA

approved of Pottery Barn for the
apartment he’s paying for, not items from
the catalogue of “Up My Ass Digest.”

James laughs.

PIPPA
Hey, that’s not fair —-

Tara clamps a hand over Pippa’s mouth.

TARA
It will be, I promise.

Dana LUNGES at Pippa, pulling at her clothes and hair.

that be? I search around in my little
desk and low and behold...no press pass.

Good luck elsewhere, I'm not sure you'll
want a reference from me -—

Tara silences her by HOLDING UP HER HAND. Audrey stops,
shocked.

TARA
Models with Toddlers, kind of an exposé
on working models with children...their
challenges, we always think of models
being these sex goddesses, perfect
bodies, but how do they handle the
challenges of motherhood and —-

Audrey backs Tara out of her office. RICK JENKINS, Audrey's
boss, comes to the door, listens.

AUDREY
You’1l have to train the new hire -—

TARA
Think of it, Cindy Crawford, Christie
Brinkley, this new model Kate Cates, have
you heard of her --

RICK JENKINS
That is a great idea, Audrey. Women are
always complaining about how sexist our
interviews are, but that idea should
appeal to a lot of women.

TARA
I was hoping to make that my first story,

Great idea. Get to it.

I don't want to talk about him --

TARA

But...who...is...he?

Tara looks worried.
KATE
I was never one of those women who wanted

I'm sure you do a great job.

ALPINE SKI-ANTI-GRAVITY-THING — MINUTES LATER

TARA
So...did the father not want to take

KATE CATES
To be fair...he doesn't know.

Kate turns on Tara quickly.

KATE CATES
What, are you going to judge me, too?

TARA
No, it's just...how do you know he
doesn't want to be the father?

KATE CATES
You wouldn’t say that if you knew him -~

TARA
That’s not fair. I’m sure he would take

responsibility.

KATE CATES
He was only interested in me because I
was a model --

TARA
No way, you’re an incredible person.

Kate smiles at Tara.

KATE CATES
You're good for my ego!

ALEX
She said that?

TARA
Yes. What are you going to do?

Alex gets up and shuts his door.

ALEX
What am I going to do?

TARA
You're his best friend -—-

ALEX
You're his girlfriend --

TARA
That's right, so why is it my job to tell
him his ex-girlfriend had his baby?

ALEX
How do you know this stuff?

TARA
I'm a reporter -~

ALEX
I thought you were a receptionist.
73.

TARA
Look, I suggested this story on models
with children, and she came up, and I did
the research and there you have it. She
had Nate's child, he doesn't know.

ALEX
I just thought she took off so fast
because of her modelling.
(turns to Tara)
You're sure about all this?

TARA
She left for London because she didn’t
want to face him.

ALEX
Wow. I had no idea.

TARA
Yeah, either did Nate apparently.

Alex looks out the window, rubbing his face. He slowly looks
back at Tara.

ALEX
Why are you doing all this...you know
this might screw up your relationship.

TARA
Because...what if he's only with me
because he thinks he can't have her?
And...after meeting Kate and her son, I
just want them to have a chance to be
together...if that's what they all want.

ALEX
You're amazing Tara, you know that?
Really, you're doing the right thing.

TARA
Thanks, Alex. Well, I better get going.

Tara turns to leave.

ALEX
Oh, Tara --

Tara turns back.

ALEX (cont'd)
How is she...otherwise?
74.

TARA
She’s good. She’s doing well.

Alex nods.
ALEX
Okay, I’1l uh...tell Nate when he gets
back.

INT. BEAUTY SALON - NIGHT

Tara sits in a chair facing Kate as she gets her hair done.

TARA
So, you’ve been modelling for how long
now?
KATE
(yawning)

Feels like my whole life...

Kate turns her attention to Tara, looks her over. Kate turns
to the stylist, RON.

KATE (cont’d)
Ron, look at all her thick hair...are you
thinking what I’m thinking?
Ron stops fluffing Kate’s hair and stares at Tara.

RON
I’m starting to...robe please!

A GUY appears. He places a robe around Tara. The STYLIST
looks at her carefully in the mirror, leaning in to listen to
Kate. Kate gets up, standing behind Tara.

TARA
I just had a trim --

KATE
See, she has beautiful bone structure,
but all this...

Kate leans forward and picks up Tara's long hair.

KATE (cont'd)
...sorority hair...obscures her beauty.

Tara makes a face.
75.

TARA
I just got a trim --
STYLIST
{to Kate)

You are right...this lifted and look at
what is exposed! Juan, Ben, Shawnie,
hurry, my supplies!

TARA
I really don't want a short haircut --

KATE
Tara, relax, you are in the hands of a
genius, and this is my treat for
listening to all my sad stories!

Kate leans down and squeezes Tara.

KATE (cont'd)
Isn’t this fun?

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - LATER
Tara and Kate walk down the street looking like an odd
version of the Bobsey Twins...Tara's hair is cut exactly like

Kate's. Tara pulls at her short bob, looking into a window.

KATE
You look fabulous --

TARA
That's what you both kept saying.

Kate stops and looks at Tara, surprised, hurt.

KATE
You don't like it?

Tara can see she feels bad, instantly tries to take it back.

TARA
It's not that I don't like it...I mean,
it looks fantastic on you, but you are a
model...I'm...not.

Kate looks at Tara carefully, her gaze dropping from Tara's
face to the rest of her.
76.

~ KATE
You're right...but not because of the
haircut, it's your clothes, your clothes
are all wrong.

TARA
I don't think that's it.
(beat)
What's wrong with my clothes?

CUT TO:
INT. KATE’S APARTMENT - CLOSET - DAY

ROWS AND ROWS OF CLOTHES.

KATE
You hide beneath these baggy, funky
clothes...that's fine for college, but
you are a working girl now. You want to
be noticed, you have to put yourself out
there. Say good-bye to thrift stores and
hello to a wardrobe that shows off your
style --

~ TARA
But that is my style...

Kate throws a fun, sequined party dress up against Tara.

TARA (CONT'D)
See, where would I wear this?

Tara turns and looks at herself in the mirror, and likes what
she sees, she twirls slightly, smiling.

TARA (cont'd)
Wow, is this Prada?

KATE
Of course and it will look fabulous on
you...here, I have a sewing machine in
the back bedroom -~-

Kate takes the dress, Tara follows her. She stops in the
hallway when she sees a black and white PHOTO OF NATE. He
stands shirtless, looking incredibly handsome.

TARA
Wow...I love that photo -——

KATE
And I loved that man...
77.

They both look at him together.

TARA
Have you tried to call him since you got
back?

KATE
No...

TARA

What are you waiting for?
Kate smiles, nods.

KATE
You give me confidence to do things I
would never do...you know, maybe I will.

She holds the dress up against Tara again.

KATE (CONT'D)
There's this great party I thought we
could go to tonight, Josh is going to be
at his Grandma’s all night...

CUT TO:

INT. LIMO - MOVING ~ NIGHT

Tara is in the middle of a coterie of MODELS. She is dressed
exactly like them, slip dresses beneath fur, stilettos, and
champagne flowing. Tara has obviously had a lot. One of the
MODELS opens the sunroof to the car and pokes her head
through. She pulls Tara and Kate up with her. They scream
and wave.

EXT. HALO - NIGHT

A line around the block. The limo pulls up and the girls get
out. Tara looks at her watch.

TARA

TARA
Hey Uncle Pussy..-hey kitty, kitty --

Tara reaches for the light switch but stumbles over something
in the dark -- FALLS TO THE FLOOR.

Suddenly the LIGHTS go ON. Tara SCREAMS. Tara looks up to
see Nate peering down at her. He wears his pajamas. Tara
has fallen in the middle of his suitcases.

TARA (cont'd)
Oh my God, Nate! Nate, you're home
early!

NATE
And you're drunk...where have you been?

Nate extends his hand, helping her to her feet. Tara adjusts
her dress, self consciously tugging on her hair.

TARA
I was out with Dana and then --

NATE
Where has all your hair gone? My God,
you look like a completely different
person.

Nate walks around Tara, who teeters on her three inch heels.

TARA
You like it?

NATE
You look beautiful - where did you say
you were again?

The questions, the surprise, the alcohol coursing through her
veins, Tara lunges into his arms, kissing him all over.
79.

TARA
WELCOME HOME!

They stumble back towards the bedroom, knocking over every
lamp and piece of furniture on the way.

CUT TO:
NATE'S BEDROOM - LATER

TARA
You didn't like it?

NATE
How could anyone not like

Tara giggles, swats at him. Nate turns over and stares at
her for a long moment.

NATE (cont'd)
You seem...different...and I don't think
it's just the hair...
(looking at her carefully)
How long was I gone for?

Nate pulls her close.
NATE (cont'd)

I missed you, Tara. I missed you so
much.

Tara smiles into his chest.

NATE (CONT'D)
And...I'm sorry I did that, left like

TARA
It's okay, please, you don't have to
explain.
(looking up at him)
Nate...I have something to tell you --

NATE
Wait, I want to say something first. I
should have said this a long time ago...

Nate pulls back, looking at Tara.
NATE (cont'd)
I'm not taking that job in San Francisco,

I haven't told them yet, but I will
Monday.

Tara smiles.

TARA
Great -—

NATE
But what I really want to tell you is...

Nate takes her face in his hands.

NATE (cont'd)
I love you.

Tara clasps her hands over her mouth.

TARA
You do?

You already know this, but I love you,

They come together and begin kissing passionately.

Tara's hand flutters to her face.

TARA
But I don’t have any -——

NATE
You don't need makeup...I love your
freckles...I'm going to kiss each and

every one...

And he begins to do just that when the DOORBELL rings.

NATE (cont'd)
Go away —~

It keeps ringing.

NATE (cont'd)
Ugh...don't move.

TARA
Who was that?

NATE
An old...friend, girlfriend. Alright, an

If you want to talk to her, go ahead, you
could still catch her -~
Tara walks to the window and looks out.

Tara goes to open the window, Nate walks over and stops her.

NATE
No. I haven't seen you ina week.
You're the one I want to spend my

He envelopes her in an embrace.

NATE (cont'd)
I thought we could go to Manny's for

Shit. I can't. I have plans.

TARA
(searching his face)
About...?

NATE
Nothing...it's just...you aren't upset
about her...showing up, are you? Because
I had nothing to do with that -~

TARA
No...I know. But if you want to talk to
her, an ex-girlfriend, that's fine with
me.

Nate looks at her with newfound admiration.

NATE
God, you're so...centered. So...secure.
You know what a turn on that is?

didn't even know it -—
(running after Kate)
KATIE, wait up -- I want to meet him, I
WANT TO MEET MY SON -- WAAAAIIIIIITIT!

AUDREY
Wait, Tara...that wasn’t your baby?

TARA
No, I tried to -~

AUDREY
What you won’t stoop to, unbelievable!

Audrey turns and walks away.

This leaves Dana who looks at Tara sympathetically and slowly
walks back inside, leaving Tara and Nate to face one other.
The only sound is the dead leaves blowing across the
sidewalk.

TARA
I don't know what to say.

NATE
r don't know if I want to hear it.
98.

TARA
Okay...well, we found out you're not a
father...that's good, right?

Nate shrugs.

NATE
That would've been okay.

TARA
Well then, what? Say
something...anything.

NATE
Why? Why did you do this behind my back?

TARA
It just sort of happened.

Nate looks at as if to say, “you’1l have to do better than
that.”

TARA (cont! d)
I...I heard about Kate...and then I found
out she was a model...I was worried I
wouldn’t measure up. You've been with
all of these interesting women.

NATE
Tara —-

TARA
I know. I know.

NATE
What happened to honesty...and trust?

TARA
I guess I honestly wanted to know
something that you didn’t trust me with.

Nate turns and walks away. Tara goes to speak, her voice
cracks.

TARA (cont’d)
And you didn’t trust me Nate, you
didn’t...or you would have told me about
your past.

And without waiting for a response, Tara quickly turns and
disappears back into the apartment.

SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
99.

INT. CHAT MAGAZINE - DAY

Tara hovers above a young woman, JANET, who now trains for
her job. She is clearly nervous. Tara in comparison is
composed, the seasoned veteran. Two lines ring at once.

TARA
Go ahead.

JANET (INTO PHONE)
Audrey Lanford's office. She's not in
right now, may I take a message?

Janet searches the desk for a pad to write on, Tara supplies
her with the phone log.

TARA
(whispers)
Ask to put them on hold --

JANET
Can you hold please?

Tara punches the second button. Janet takes down the
messages.

CUT TO:

AUDREY LANFORD'S OFFICE — LATER
Tara staggers a half dozen newspapers on Audrey's desk.

TARA
She likes them in this order, New York
Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Financial
Times and then the Columbus Dispatch,
she's from Ohio. Coffee, no cream or
sugar, on the upper left hand corner.
Phone calls or faxes on her chair so she
can't miss them. When she walks in she
likes the first ten minutes to collect
her thoughts unless her boss, Jenkins, is
on the line -~-

Tara is unaware of it, but Audrey stands at the door
watching.

TARA (cont'd)
She always wants to know when her mother
or boyfriend Roger is on the phone, but
she has two sisters, she usually will
take Rhonda's call, but take a message
from Carla -~
100.

Audrey enters, nods.

TARA (cont'd)
Good morning.

Audrey nods her hello. Tara and Janet brush past.
OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TARA
Don't bother telling her anything
important until she's had two cups of
coffee, she won't retain it.

CUT TO:

TARA'S DESK - LATER

Tara packs the very last of her belongings. She carefully
puts a framed picture of Nate on top.

JANET
I have something to ask you...

TARA
Yeah, anything.

JANET
You're so amazing at this job. Can you
tell me what you did to get fired, so I
won't repeat it?

Tara slips on her coat and picks up her box.

TARA
Trust me, there's no chance of that.
Good luck, I'm sure you'll do a great
job.

CUT TO:
DANA'S DESK - LATER
Tara and Dana hug.
DANA
I feel awful. I kicked you out of our

apartment, you and Nate broke up, and now
you've been fired.

TARA
I know, and it's all your fault.
101.

Tara pulls away.

TARA (cont'd)
I'm kidding.

DANA
You know, you don’t have to move out now.

You can stay..--

TARA
Thanks.

DANA
Have you called him...at all?

TARA
No. I don't think he ever wants to hear
from me again.

DANA
It's been a couple of weeks...you should

try.

Dana's phone starts ringing, she runs around to the other
side of the desk. Tara hoists her box up, and walks out.

ELEVATORS - DAY
Audrey catches Tara just as she is about to get on.

AUDREY
Tara, hey. I just wanted to give you
this.

Audrey hands Tara a chit of paper.

AUDREY (cont'd)
She's expecting your call. I would do it
today if you can.

Tara looks down at the piece of paper.

TARA
Beth Brown, the editor of GIRL POWER

magazine?

AUDREY
That's right. I fired her years ago-
Most of the top editors in this town were
once employees of mine.
102.

TARA
Thank you, Audrey. But why am I
calling...I mean, is it for an assistant
position...or?

AUDREY
A writer...I think you're a terrible
assistant. If I were you I would stick
to the creative side of things. Good
luck.

TARA
But, does that mean you read my -—

Audrey walks away, stops.
AUDREY
I'm printing your article about exes,
it'll be in this months magazine in our
true stories section.

Tara squeals and runs back to Audrey, about to hug her,
Audrey puts up her hand to stop her.

AUDREY (cont’d)
Please, no physical contact.

Audrey turns on her heel and walks away, a ghost of a smile
crosses her face.

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - DAY
Tara exits the building. She looks up to see they are
replacing the Calvin Klein billboard. Only half of Kate
Cates face looms above Times Square. Tara stares at it as

PEOPLE jostle her about.

CUT TO:
CLOSE ON THE REAL KATE CATES. WE ARE:
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
Her face as lovely as ever, put there is something different
about the way she looks, happy and peaceful. We hear
laughing, and we now see who she's been watching...

ALEX AND JOSHUA

running after each other in the park. Alex falls down and
Joshua leaps on top of him, pummelling him.
103.

They cover each other in the fall leaves, Josh's laugh
contagious...Kate runs to join them.

cuT TO:
INT. JESSICA FUKUNAGA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jessica sits at her kitchen table, working. She stops when
her cat jumps into her lap, putting a paw on her shoulder.
She strokes the cat, looking out the window.

Jessica kisses the cat and then picks up the phone and
quickly dials.

JESSICA (INTO PHONE)
Hi, I was just calling to get the lab
results of one of my patients. Yes, a
Tara O'Connor...

CUT TO:

INT. ART STUDIO - DAY

Pippa is hard at work on a sculpture made of papier mache.
She works quickly, completely into what she is doing.

CUT TO:
EXT. BROWNSTONE - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Tara and Dana walk out of a cute building on a street filled
with cute buildings.

DANA
Are you sure you want to live way the
hell out here?

TARA
Brooklyn's not that far out. Besides, I
can't afford to live by myself in
Manhattan.

DANA
I just feel so guilty that I kicked you
out in the first place...and had James

move in -~

TARA
No. I think living on my own is a good
idea.

DANA

But you're going to be all alone --
104.

TARA
I'm going to be on my own, there's a
difference.
(beat)
And when I get my shit together, I'm
going to get Nate back. I miss him so
much.

Just then a BLONDE WOMAN strolling a baby carriage passes
them going in the opposite direction. Tara spins around ~~

TARA (cont'd)
Kate -- Kate, it's Tara -~ KATE!

Tara takes a few running steps in the woman's direction. The
woman finally turns around, but it's not Kate. Tara puts up
her hand in apology, slowly turning to face Dana.

DANA
It looks like Nate isn't the only one you
miss.

CUT TO:

INT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Tara knocks on the door. After a moment Kate answers the
door.

TARA
Before you slam the door in my face,
which you have every right to do, I just
want to tell you I'm sorry ~~

Kate lunges forward and gathers Tara up in an embrace.

cur TO:

INT. WELL HEALTH CENTER ~ ROOM - DAY

Tara sits on the edge of the table. Jessica Fukunaga walks
in.

JESSICA
I just wanted to let you know in person —~

TARA
Am I dying?

JESSICA
You're normal. Completely healthy, like I
said, we just had to do a second test to
be sure.
105.

Tara breaks down crying. Jessica puts her arm around her.

JESSICA (cont'd)
And even though it was completely insane,
Tt understand what you did. I think we
all understood. I would never do that
myself, but it was kind of wild that you
did.

They hug.
cuT TO:

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Tara stands at the door, sifting through mail. She gets to a
rather large manila envelope and opens it. We look down to
see an invitation to PIPPA ANDERS NEW WORK AT STUDIO 4. Tara

smiles.

CUT TO:

INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Tara and Dana enter the packed gallery. Photographers,
celebrities, rich and starving artists all mix and mingle.

Tara scans the room looking for Pippa, jumps when she turns
around and sees Nate -~- or what looks like Nate. In fact, it
is a room FILLED WITH NATES.

CARTOON PLASTER AND METAL REMAKES OF NATE being SWALLOWED,
TORTURED, FRIED. Duplicates of Nate everywhere being
devoured and reshaped. The plaster Nates all look alike,
except for their cause of death.

Tara looks up to see:

NATE SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING...over to...

NATE BEING TAKEN DOWN BY A PACK OF WOLVES...

NATE DROWNING IN QUICKSAND.

Finally, a LARGE STEEL JAW that rests in the middle of the
floor. A tiny man TRAPPED inside, covered in a slime-like

substance. A tinny recording of a blood curdling scream
repeats endlessly.

Walking up to the steel jaw, both Dana and Tara lean in
simultaneously to read the placard. The neat black on white,
understated print reads, DIGESTING NATE.
106.

Tara is transfixed. She looks up to see Jessica and Kate
Cates as well as Alex all standing around looking at it as
well. Alex whistles. Pippa joins them.

PIPPA
Well...what do you think? The exhibit is
called CLOSURE...thank you, Tara, for
helping me with the idea.

TARA
You’ re welcome...it's great, really,
amazing work Pippa.
They hug briefly.
TARA (cont'd)
I wonder if Nate is coming...is he

coming?

Tara looks at Pippa and then Alex adjusts his tie.

ALEX

Uh...didn't you know, Tara?
TARA

What?
ALEX

He took that job...in San Francisco.

TARA
Oh?

Tara instantly deflates. She tears up, everyone looks at
her.

TARA (cont'd)
But I thought he turned them down...T
thought --

ALEX
They still wanted him. So, he said yes.

TARA
But I was going to try and, and see
him...it's too late. How could he be
gone?

ALEX
He's not.

Tara looks up hopefully.
107.

ALEX (cont'd)
Well...he leaves tonight.

TARA
When, what time?

ALEX

(glancing at watch)
His flight takes off in two hours.

Tara looks at everyone.
TARA
I need to stop him...I'll never get there
in time - oh God.

Just then a good-looking, built GUY wearing a police uniform
comes up and puts his arms around Pippa's waist.

GUY/OFFICER BILL
Hey, how's it going?

Pippa smiles, turning to look at her new beau.

PIPPA
Maybe we can get you there in time.

CUT TO:
INT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
Tara, Dana, Kate and Jessica are crammed in the back of the
cop car. Pippa is in front with her guy OFFICER BILL,
they're practically making out. The SIRENS going.
DANA
Isn't this illegal...I mean, using a

police vehicle for something -~-

OFFICER BILL
You'd be surprised how often we do this -~

TARA
Can you go any faster?

Officer Bill puts pedal to the metal, they all SCREAM.
CUT TO:
EXT. JFK - NIGHT

They pull up at drop-off.
108.

KATE
Now remember, Nate likes an honest
apology, sincerity --

JESSICA
Also, don't try and turn it back on him,
he doesn't like to be wrong -~

PIPPA
And an offer of a blow job on the way
home may not be a bad idea -~-

EVERYONE
Pippa --

PIPPA
Okay, okay, but just keep it simple. You
fucked up, no one is permanently damaged,
you're sorry.

TARA
Right. Thanks guys...I love you!

Collective hug.
CUT TO:

EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT

Nate pulls up in a cab a few cars down from them. He gets
out and heads inside.

INT. TERMINAL - NIGHT

Tara looks around wildly, heading for the American Airlines
check in.

SECURITY - NIGHT
Nate heads straight for the baggage check-in. Goes through.

Tara appears, sees him right in front of her. She runs to go
through and is stopped by a security agent.

SECURITY AGENT
Ticket, please.

TARA
{ don't have one, I'm just --

SECURITY AGENT
Sorry, no ticket, no entry into the

gangway -—
109.

~ TARA
See that guy, I have to see him before he
leaves, please -- can't you stop him?

SECURITY AGENT
No.

Tara gives him a dirty look.

TARA
(screams)
NATE -- NATE GOODMAN, NATE -~-

A few PEOPLE turn around, but her voice sounds small and
quickly disappears.

SECURITY AGENT
Are you going to be a problem, because I
don't want to have to call back up if I
don't have to.

cuT TO:

BANK OF PAY PHONES - MOMENTS LATER

~ Tara quickly dials.
CUT TO:

STARBUCKS - TERMINAL — SAME
Nate stands in line, checks his watch. The phone rings.

NATE ( INTO PHONE)
Hello?

TARA'S VOICE
Nate, hi, it's me...don't hang up. I'm
here at the airport, they won't let me
through without a ticket.

Nate steps up one more in line.

NATE (INTO PHONE)
What are you doing?

TARA'S VOICE
Apologizing...

CUT BACK TO:
110.

PAY PHONES - SAME

TARA (INTO PHONE)
T don't want you to leave. I want to be
with you. I know what I did was insane.
Nate, I'm sorry, I'm so --

NATE'S VOICE
Caramel Macchiata, no foam --

TARA (INTO PHONE)
What?

NATE'S VOICE
Nothing...I'm ordering a coffee...

TARA (INTO PHONE)
Aren't those a little sweet? I thought
you took your coffee black --

NATE'S VOICE
When I'm at a Starbucks I splurge.

TARA (INTO PHONE)

Oh.

(beat)
See...I didn't know that about
you....please don't leave. I love you so

much...I can't just let you leave.

CUT BACK TO:

STARBUCKS - SAME

Nate looks back to the general area that Tara is standing in.
The following is INTERCUT:

NATE (INTO PHONE)
I'll call you when I get to San
Francisco.

TARA (INTO PHONE)
(chokes up)
You're going?

Nate visibly softens.

STARBUCKS EMPLOYEE
CARAMEL MACCHIATA NO FOAM -~—

TARA (INTO PHONE)
Well...that's you.
i111.

Nate starts running back to the main part of the terminal.

NATE (INTO PHONE)
Yep..

ANNOUNCEMENT
Now boarding American Airlines Flight 263
bound for San Francisco, now boarding...

TARA (INTO PHONE)
That's you too, uh?

MAIN PART OF TERMINAL

Nate runs through to the terminal, searching all of the phone
pooths...he finally spies Tara, curled into the phone, facing
away from him. He stops, slowly walks towards her.

NATE ( INTO PHONE)
Did I ever tell you about Missy Hogan?

TARA (INTO PHONE)
Who?

NATE (INTO PHONE)
From kindergarten, my first girlfriend.

Nate now stands about ten feet from Tara, he watches her
through the crowd.

TARA (INTO PHONE)
(laughing)
No...so, was she hot?

NATE (INTO PHONE)
Incredible...strawberry blonde, freckles
like you have...she used to stick gum in
my hair. She smelled of gum and Tinker
Bell perfume...and then there was Dolly
in first grade --

TARA (INTO PHONE)
What happened to Missy?

Nate steadily approaches.

NATE ( INTO PHONE)
I caught her kissing someone else in the
cloak room, then it was all over...but
Dolly, she was a hot little number.
112.

TARA ( INTO PHONE)
I'm jealous...

Nate now stands inches from Tara.

NATE ( INTO PHONE)
See...that's why I never wanted to talk
about ex-girlfriends...

Tara, hearing him, feeling him, turns around. They face each
other, still holding their phones. He leans in and kisses
ner...it is a classic, romantic comedy end of the movie kiss.
Then...Nate pulls away.

NATE (cont'd)
I've got a plane to catch -~-

He kisses her quickly and starts to turn away. Tara follows.

TARA
Are you kidding, what, you're -~

NATE
I'm still taking the job, honey, I
accepted, I have an apartment, my plane
is boarding now, I have to —~

Tara, flabbergasted, tries to re-group.

TARA
But, I thought -~

NATE
Look, we're going to try and make this
work...it will be long distance and it
will be hard, but we have weekends...and
then we'll see. Just trust that it will
work...I think we have a pretty good
chance.

TARA
Trust...

They kiss again quickly and Nate stares deeply into her eyes.

NATE
I'll call you as soon as I get there --

TARA
Call before...on one of those airplane
phones.
113.

Nate turns and runs back through security, leaving Tara alone
in the terminal. He turns and waves just before he walks
through and disappears...but not for good.

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT — NIGHT
Tara sits curled up on the couch, cradling the phone.
NATE'S VOICE
That's when I was fourteen. God, was she
beautiful. She was French. And then the

next summer, I was a camp
counselor...Monique, she was older and --

Tara nods.

TARA
Okay, okay, 1 think I got the picture.

NATE'S VOICE
We haven't even gotten out of high school
yet.

TARA
Well...maybe we should just talk about
them when it's...relevant.

Tara laughs as he begins to protest.

FADE OUT:

THE END.
