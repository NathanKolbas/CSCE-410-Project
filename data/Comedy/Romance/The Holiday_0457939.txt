HOLIDAY

March 22, 2005
LUSH, ROMANTIC MOVIE MUSIC OVER A BLACK SCREEN
FADE IN:
ON A YOUNG COUPLE KISSING

on the beach. As the CAMERA GLIDES AROUND THEM, the MUSIC
soars.

CAMERA WIDENS and we realize we are watching the Young Couple
on a large Computer Screen and at the computer's keyboard,
writing the MUSIC we're hearing is MILES -- early thirties,
boyish, shaggy in his T-shirt and khakis. The depth and
tenderness of his composition belies his appearance. We are
in:

MILES’ L.A. HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS

Small and Spanish. It’s a December afternoon. Through the
windows, we see the wind blowing olive trees in a courtyard.
Miles continues to compose as we SEE his PRETTY GIRLFRIEND in
the b.g., talking on her cell as she gets dressed. An actress
no doubt.

Over, we HEAR the VOICE OF A YOUNG ENGLISH WOMAN, IRIS.
Iris' Voice is knowing and warm.

IRIS (V.0.)
I have found almost everything ever
written about love to be true.
Shakespeare said, "Journeys end
when lovers meet." What an
extraordinary thought. Personally I
have not experienced anything
remotely close to that but I’m more
than willing to believe Shakespeare
had. I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should. I
am constantly amazed by it's sheer
power and by all its subtleties and
complexities.

Miles' Girlfriend passes behind the computer screen and
Miles, taken with her, seems to now compose to her beauty.
She, however, is in a rush and doesn’t seem to notice. Miles
reaches for her with one arm, kisses her hand, still playing
the keyboard with the other. She looks at him impatiently.
Oblivious to this, Miles watches her exit as he continues to
play.

IRIS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
It was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind". Now, that, is
something I know to be true.
INT. PORSCHE - MOVING — SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT - MUSIC
CONTINUES

A COUPLE drives home from a party without speaking. The
Woman, in her early thirties, in the passenger seat, turns
and stares steadily at her Man. Feeling her eyes on him, he
glances over but she seems to see right through him. He
can't take it. His eyes return to the road. she nods to
herself.

IRIS (V.0.)
And for some, quite inexplicably...
love fades.

INT. BEDROOM - BRENTWOOD — NIGHT - MUSIC CONTINUES

ARTHUR ABBOTT, eighty-some years old, gets in his Queen size
bed, alone. A photo of his Beloved Wife, taken in the
Fifties, sits on his night stand. Arthur takes his moment to
look at the photo, as he always does, before turning out the
light.

IRIS [V.0.)
For others, love is simply lost.

The Wind blows a window closed.
INT. PUB - ENGLAND - NIGHT ~ MUSIC CONTINUES

A GREAT LOOKING MAN, around 40, makes his way though a
crowded pub. There isn't a girl in the place who doesn't
look in his direction. He shyly smiles at one lucky Girl.

IRIS (¥.0)
-- But then of course, love can
also be found. Even if just for
the night.

INT. LONDON NEWSPAPER OFFICE - AFTER HOURS

A Holiday party is in progress. CAMERA WENDS its way through
the festive atmosphere.

TRIS (V.0.)
And then there's another kind of
love. The cruelest kind. The one
that almost kills its victims. It's
called, unrequited love. of that,
I am an expert. Most love stories
are pretty much about people who
fall in love -- with each other.
But what about the rest of us? What
about our stories? Those of us who
fall in love alone. We are the

(MORE)
IRIS (V.0O.) (CONT'D)
victims of the one sided affair.
We are the cursed of the loved
ones. We are the unloved ones.
The walking wounded, the
handicapped without the advantage
of a great parking space. Yes, you
are looking at one such individual.
Yes, there...in the blue sweater.
That's right. That's me. And I
have willingly loved that man --

(and we see HIM across the

room, drink in hand,

talking to a small group)
-- for over three miserable years.
The absolute worst years of my
life. The worst Christmases, the
worst birthdays, New Year's Eves
brought in by tears and Xanax.
These years that I have been in
love have been the darkest days of
my life...all because I've been
cursed by being in love with a man
who does not and will not love me
back. Oh, God, here he
comes...heart pounding ...throat
thickening..-absolutely can't
swallow... all the usual symptoms.

We are looking at IRIS, smartest girl in the room although
she doesn't know it. Sweet to her core. The unrealized hero
of her own life.

Iris slips back, deeper into the crowd and finds a friendly
face, HANNAH. Hannah is smoking and drinking champagne.
Irie takes Hannah's glass and downs it.

HANNA
Uh-oh...

Irie peeks around and spots HIM as another group has grabbed
him. His name is JASPER. He's not conventionally good
looking but has a confident and sly sexuality which draws
women to him. He's clearly the biggest star in the room, the
paper's most important and recognized writer. Everyone
wants his attention but few can actually get it.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
(noticing)
Oh, Jasper...You're not still?

IRIS
No, no. No. That's over. Very
over.
{to young passing
Assistant)
(MORE)
IRIS (CONT'D)
Peter, bring Hannah another
champagne and one for me, will you?
Please? Thank you.

HANNAH
I thought so.
(on the QT)
What was the story with you two?
You were shagging him, weren’t you?

IRLS
More importantly, I was in love
with him...truth be known.

HANNAH
Oh yes, I remember, then you found
cut he was shagging that drip from
circulation.

IRIS
Yes. I did... which is when I
stopped shagging him. I don't
think we should be talking about
this at the...

GUY
(passing by)
-- Iris.
IRIS
Jeffrey.
GUY

My wife loved your column last
week. Read it to me out loud. Very
clever. Made her cry.

IRIS
Thank her for me.

HANNAH
But I always see you two together.
He cheated on you and you stayed
friends?

IRIS
Yes, well, he doesn't see it as
cheating. See, I thought we were
together, he said we were only
“dating”.

HANNAH
Does dating mean you're supposed to
assume he was shagging other women?
IRIS
I didn't think so. Obviously. I
was head over heels...you know...
(embarrassed)
--everyone knew. Does it look like
I'm erying right now?

HANNAH
No, it looks like it's from my
cigarette. Did he ever tell you he
loved you?

IRIS
Yes. Three, almost four times.
When I reminded him of that he said
it must've been as an answer to a
question...which it most certainly
was not.

HANNAH
You know, Iris, when you catch a
guy shagging another woman, you're
not supposed to stay friends with
him. You're supposed to never talk
to the prick again, you're supposed
to throw things at him, scream,
call him names...nct do his fucking
laundry.

IRIS

I do not do his laundry. Did
someone tell you I do his laundry?
All we do now is...we...we do e—
mails. Not when he's with "her" of
course. Also when he's not with
her, we talk on the phone.
Sometimes for hours...

{loves the thought)
And then there's the occasional
long lunch...

(then)
It's bloody torture. But he says
we'd be crazy to give up our
friendship, thet I'm one of the
most important people in his life.

HANNAH
I never realized how pathetic you
are.

IRIS

Really? God, I'm so aware of it.

Their champagne arrives. Iris drinks hers down quickly.
HANNAR
Fucking men. They always get us
right where they want us. Who
wouldn't want a fantastic girl like
you in love with him...hanging on
his every word...he knows anytime
he wants to crawl back,..

IRIS
(confidentially)
-- Actually he has said some small
comments like that recently.
Hasn't come right out and said it
exactly but...

EDITOR NOT IN THE PARTY MODE
(passing by)
Iris, did you file your story?

IRIS
No, I did not, thank you very much.
{checks her watch)
Down to the wire...Sorry.

Iris takes off, then rushes back to Hannah.

IRIS (CONT'D)
Try to keep this between us.

Iris rushes into:
A TINY CUBICLE OF AN OFFICE.

The walls are covered with Black and White PHOTOS of BRIDES
AND GROOMS on their WEDDING DAY. Iris writes the UNIONS
column, the only good news in the newspaper, which features
Couples on their Wedding Day in every Sunday's Style Section
She sits at her computer and brings up a story which just
needs a few last words. She looks at a PHOTO of a BEAMING
BRIDE AND GROOM in their Fifties,.refers to her notes.

IRIS
(as she types)
The groom's best friend spoke for
Many guests when he said, “Hilary
+ will open Edward's eyes and round
out his life".

MAN'S VOICE
What's it like to be the only
person committed to their work
while the rest of us are slumming?
Iris looks up. It's Jasper, standing in her doorway. A
small bit of holly in his lapel, a drink in his hand.

TRIS
(loving him, has to look
away)
You Mean what's it like to be the
only person not to finish their
work on time. Hold on....
(types a last line)

JASPER
Look how fast that big brain of
yours works. Probably a brilliant
finish.

IRIS
I assure you it's not.

She hits a button and sends her story to her editor.

JASPER
(knowing just how to lean
in the doorway)
Hi...

IRIS

(dying, she adores him so

much)
Hi. Your column today was
fantastic. Loved that line...

(quoting him)
"The onrushing stripping of dignity
and thought from British lives."
Gave me the chills.

The smile on his face tells us how much he loves hearing this

from her.

JASPER
Got you something for Christmas.

IRIS
Got you something too.

She opens her drawer and takes out a gift.

JASPER
Oh, damn, I don't actually have
mine here...as a matter of fact, I
may have misplaced it but I know I
bought you something. Hope I
didn’t lose it. Could be in my
Caress
IRIS

That's okay.
JASPER

You want to know what it is?
IRIS

No, I can wait. But here, open

yours.
Jasper opens Iris' gift and finds a book.

JASPER
(cvecognizing it)
You stinker...

She melts. He opens the book. Seems to genuinely love it.

JASPER (CONT'D)
First edition. Where'd you find
it?
(seems to be really taken
with her)
You're so great...

At this moment her world is near perfection. His eyes seem
to brim with tears as he looks at her...but maybe she's just
imagining it. Through the glass wall of her office, they see
their EDITOR IN CHIEF, HUGH BUCKLEY standing on a chair to
quiet down the crowd.

JASPER (CONT'D)
Hate that we can never talk.

IRIS
I know...

They exit together into:
THE NEWSROOM

The crowd has gathered. Iris turns and has somehow lost
Jasper. She looks for him as she stands alone, in the back,
near her office.

HUGE
First of all, to each and every one
of you, a very Merry Christmas. We
are not officially closed, as you
well know but with any luck, we
will not go to war, the flu will
not spread and the Queen will not
abdicate. Given that, we may be
able to get by with a smaller than

(MORE) .
HUGH (CONT'D)
normal staff. Now, before some of
you rush off on holiday I have one
rather important announcement.
This effects Iris. Iris, where are
you?

Ixis, surprised, raises her hand and is pushed forward.

HUGH (CONT'D)
Iris, T have a tip for you.

TRIS
Excellent.

HUGE
A wedding was privately announced
earlier today which I don't believe
any other paper in town knows about
and I want you to be the first to
report on this particular “union”
as it is between two of our most
esteemed colleagues. May I
introduce, the newly engaged --
Sarah Smith-Alcott and Jasper
Bloom.

SARAH steps forward. A sincere, make no waves kind of girl.
A second banana if ever there was one. She lights up as she
turns to Jasper who joins her, taking her hand.

CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN on Iris, trying desperately not to
ery in front of everyone she knows. Jasper says a few words
but Tris doesn't hear them. When he finishes, he catches
Iris in the crowd. She gives him a small approving nod and
the bravest possible smile. As their eyes connect, someone
pats Jasper on the back and his attention is once again gone
and Iris is once again, left alone.

IRIS - CLOSE

as she escapes through the crowd and INTO HER OFFICE. She
takes her coat off the back of her door, slips into it then
sees the wrinkled wrapping paper from her gift. She picks it
ub, crumples it, then notices the book is sitting on an end
table, forgotten.

IRIS
(holding back her tears)
Yeah, that's right...I'm sooo
great. Greatest idiot that ever
lived.
10.

INT. TRAIN - MOVING - NIGHT

tris, holding the book on her lap, sits in an empty train
car, a tissue in her hand.

EXT. SURREY - NIGHT

Snow falls as Iris walks the curve of the cobblestoned street
of her small village. At one end of the street is a church.
At the other, is the village pub which is overflowing with
patrons. As Iris passes the pub, someone calls her name but
she doesn't answer.

EXT. VILLAGE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

A picture postcard stone cottage sits nestled in a winter
garden. This is one of the smallest houses you've ever seen.
Tris walks the narrow footbridge up to her front gate. She
opens the gete and a bell rings. A dog can be heard barking
inside the house.

INT. IRIS' COTTAGE

Iris ENTERS, turns on the light and is greeted by her dog,
CHARLIE.

TRIS
Hey, look who it is...Give me a
kiss...give mé a....
(she hugs him)
You're so warm. Okay. Okay. Give
me a sec, Charlie, I gotta take off
my boots. Hold on...

iris falls into a soft upholstered chair. She pulls off her
boots, sits there for a second in her wet coat, wet hair,
looks at her dog.

IRIS (CONT'D)
Guess what?

And then she bursts inte tears.
INT. LIVING ROOM - BRENTWOOD, CALIFORNIA - MORNING

The Man we saw driving the Porsche (on page 2), wakes up on a
couch. Pillow under his head, blanket over him. He is in a
great looking room in a great. looking, sun filled house.
6,000 square feet in prime Brentwood. The house has the
relaxed good taste you get with a smart decorator.

The Man is ETHAN, artistic good locks, almost forty, tousleda
hair, T-shirt, boxers, vintage Rolex and a large dose of
narcissism which he has never discussed with his shrink.
ii.

Ethan sits up, runs his hand through his hair, looks around
and catches the eye of the uniformed Gardener, blowing
Eucalyptus leaves outside a wall of windows.

ETHAN WALKS THROUGH THE HOUSE

calling, "Amanda". He checks out the oversized Kitchen, the
Media Room, the Gym, the expansive Home Office. He passes a
Christmas Tree with a Jewish star on top, CLIMBS THE CENTER
HALL STAIRS.

ETHAN
Amanda?

ives Ethan a nod toward the bedroom and a look that suggests

A HOUSEKEEPER passes him ON HER WAY DOWN the stairs. She
giv
he*

s in trouble.

Ethan continues up the stairs and stops outside of the MASTER
BEDROOM DOOR. He hesitates, opens it and A SNEAKER FLIES AT
HIS HEAD. HE DUCKS.

The thrower of the sneaker is AMANDA WOODS, wearing white
pajamas, a bed-head of fabulous hair, a necklace with some
sort of diamond pendant and a red Kabbalah string bracelet.

Amanda wouldn't know how to play the victim if she was one.
Men don't just fall for this woman, they fall under her
spell. Fiercely intelligent, blazing eyes, a big city girl
with a small town in her past. At the moment, she's about to
explode.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
May I just say again that I didn't
sleep with her.

AMANDA
(pacing)
Okay. Right. Your receptionist
needs to work ‘til 3 in the
morning?

ETHAN
A bunch of us were working all
night...she wanted to hang out.

AMANDA
Okay, then swear on my life that
you didn't sleep with her.
{she gets very still and
waits)
Go ahead.
12.

Ethan starts to open his mouth, then stops. Another SNEAKER
FLIES at him. He ducks it.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
Your receptionist, Ethan??? That
fake-boobed, lip-linered, G-string
sticking out... She can't even
pronounce people's names!

Amanda starts to quickly gather some of Ethan's books and
things.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
See. This is why I knew we
shouldn't get married. This is why
I told you never to give up your
house. I knew it. Inside, somehow I
knew this.

ETHAN
First of all, i did not sleep with
her and secondly, we've had
problems for over a year. You don't
want. to deal with that, I know, but
we have... so let’s not make this
about Amy.

AMANDA
Oh, I'm well aware we've had
problems for over a year. If I
work a little too much I never stop
hearing about it but if you work
too much, Maestro, it's for the
sake of your "music".

ETHAN

If you work too much?! Amanda, you
cut 75 trailers this year. You put
a cutting room in the house, you
sleep with your blackberry. Look
at your side of the bed...it's like
a work station..... When was the
last time we had sex? Want to take
a guess?

AMANDA
Oh, come on, no one has time for
sex.

ETHAN
That's not true. Okay?
13.

AMANDA
Okay, that's it! You absolutely
slept with her! It's official.
We're finished! You gotta get your
clothes and all your crap and...

{shooing him out)

Can you get out? Seriously, you
have to get out.

ETHAN
I thought you wanted me to get my
clothes?

She backs him OUT THE DOOR and DOWN THE STAIRS:

AMANDA
¥ou know what I really think Ethan?
I don't think you ever really loved
me. How's that? I think you loved
the idea of you and me...but not so
Much me...not Me. Not really.

ETHAN
I don't even know what that means
except that you're criticizing the
way I loved you. I did the best I
could. Is anyone good enough for
that job?

That hurts. She opens the FRONT DOOR, tosses Ethan his keys
then moves him OUT THE DOOR.

AMANDA
I'1l send you your things.

Ethan now stands OUTSIDE THE DOOR in his boxer shorts.
Amanda faces him standing INSIDE THE HOUSE. The Gardeners
try not to listen.

ETHAN
You know you do this, right? You
screw up every relationship you've
ever been in. It's what you do.

Amanda SLAMS THE DOOR on him. As she RUNS BACK UP THE STAIRS
she HEARS:

ETHAN'S VOICE
Something about you doesn't really
want to be a couple. Not really.
You resist it...in your own way.
14

ANGLE - ETHAN OUT FRONT OF THE HOUSE
YELLING up to her Bedroom Window.

ETHAN
And it's hard to detect how you
even do it ‘cause nobody's quite as
smart as you, so you're hard to
catch at it, but it always surfaces
and this is what happens.

Amanda OPENS an Upstairs Window, looks down.

AMANDA
What happens?

ETHAN

(looking up at her)
Things end. Just like you kmew they
would. Look, you know how I feel
about you. There's nobody like you,
but you don't want to be what I
need.

{corrects himself)
Not, "I" need... you know what I
mean...

AMANDA
I would never cheat on you. Not
under any conditions.

ETHAN

And neither would I. Okay?! Look
at me...I'm sweating like a God
damned pig and look at you, you‘re
the only woman on earth who breaks
up with her boyfriend and doesn't
shed a tear. That means something
doesn't it?

AMANDA
So I'm cursed because I don't need
you enough and... why does it bug
’ you so much that I can't cry?

ETHAN
I didn't say you don't need me
enough although that's probably
true too.

Amanda rubs her chest. Ouch.
15.

AMANDA
Abhhh...Esophogial spasm. Big
one... Ow!

(sees him looking ashen)
I'll be fine.

ETHAN
I know. I was thinking about me.

AMANDA

(through her pain)
Ethan, it's over so we might as
well be honest with each other.

(very vulnerable)
dust. tell me. Did you sleep with
her?

(He still doesn't answer)
Just say it. What's the difference
at this point? Why torture me?
Put me out of my misery.

(rubs her chest}
What are we doing, here? Just tell
me. bo what's right for God's
sake.

ETHAN

(beaten)
Okay.

(that got her attention)
Yes. Okay. I slept with her. You
happy? I've been sleeping with
her. She's in love with me. She's
young and...

The Gardener looks over at Ethan, shaking his head. What a

ETHAN (CONT'D)
I-I'm not proud of this...

Amanda nods, disappears into the bedroom.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
Amanda..?

A beat and the FRONT DCOR OPENS and Amanda very calmly
CROSSES TO ETHAN.

AMANDA
Did you say, "Am I happy?"
16

ETHAN
I didn't mean that. You get me
nuts then I say things I don't
mean.

AMANDA
You know what cheating is Ethan?

ETHAN
{doesn't want to hear it)
Just.. What? No, what?

AMANDA
It's a coward's way of breaking up.
And at it's core, what it is...is
unkind. Because it makes everyone
involved, including me, feel cheap
and crazy. It's a bad way to end
things because this is how I'll
always think of you. Not as that
guy I spent three years with and
went to Hawaii with and took
cooking lessons with... You will
always and forever be the ass-hole
that lied and cheated and nothing
you ever say or do from this moment
on will ever change my mind about
you. In the world of love...not
that I'm such a genius at it...but
in the world of love...cheating is
simply not acceptable.

ETHAN
(not dealing with her)
Okay...
AMANDA

And the fact that in this fight,
you made this about me and not you
makes “ass-hole" the nicest thing I
can ever say about you.

ETHAN
No matter what you think and I know
you have a very high opinion of
yourself -- this isn’t all me. And’
when you're not in such a rage,
you'll know it too.

AMANDA
Yeah. Maybe when the rage subsides
and I stop having visions of you
two TOGETHER... I'll see your side.
Amanda turns, starts to walk away then comes right back,
makes a fist and punches Ethan in the face. Twice. He loses
his balance and falls on his ass.

INT. HOUSE

Amanda ENTERS out of breath, adrenaline pumping. She jumps
up and down out of frustration and lets out a Scream.

BRISTOL, Amanda's PREGNANT ASSISTANT arrives from the
kitchen, holding a spiral notebook and a pen and catches the
tail end of this.

BRISTOL
Is this a bad time?

AMANDA
No. I'm just flipping out a little.
Fuck! I'm alright. Shit! I'm okay.
What's up?

Fortunately, Amanda is often seved by her unique ability to
change subjects with lightning speed.

BRISTOL
Ben needs you.

INT, AMANDA'S GUEST HOUSE

which has been turned into a CUTTING ROOM. Movie one sheets
are stacked against the wall. Another wall is filled with
videotapes. Sitting at an AVID is BEN, trim, faded John Kerry
T-shirt, two day growth of beard. Amanda enters. We can see
a beautiful pool and patic umbrellas behind her.

AMANDA
Is it better?

BEN
Yeah, your changes were good. TI
just need you to sign off on it so
I can get it over to the studio.
They want it on the air tomorrow.

Amanda nods. Ben hits a button on the Avid and a TV spot for
a movie plays. We hear THAT FAMILIAR NARRATOR..... “This
Christmas, Columbia Pictures Presents..." The movie is a
Black Buddy Comedy/Action Film. The images are familiar:
Helicopters, Male Stars in Prada suits, Uzis pointed at the
lens, Blondes in bikinis, cars careening out of control.

AMANDA
(when it's over)
It finally looks like a hit.
BEN
That's why they pay you the big
bucks.

AMANDA

But I still think you cut a little
too fast off the guy in the Doo
Rag. And try putting the Blonde
before the house blowing up, and
hang on Will a few frames longer
when he says, "Don't hate me ‘cause
I‘m pretty.” His smile's great.
(heading out)
And make "Christmas Day" twice as
big. And try it in red. Buta
happy red.

BEN
(taking notes)
Okay.

AMANDA
Okay! We're done!
(impulsively)
Hey. Why don't we take off for a
few weeks.

BEN
(laughs)
Yeah.

AMANDA
I'm not kidding. Everyone elee in
town takes off for Christmas.

BRISTOL
But you always say this is our
busiest...

AMANDA.

-- I know, but we’ve got 20 people
in the office. They can handie
things for a few weeks.

BEN
You'll jet them handle things?

AMANDA
{rubs her chest)
I think I gotta get out of town. I
need some peace and quiet...or
whatever it is people go away for.
You know what I really want to do?
I want to eat carbs without wanting
(MORE)
19.
AMANDA (CONT'D)
to kill myself. I want to read a
book. Not a magazine article...an
actual book. I read these reviews,
T buy the books but I never read
them. Ouch!
(rubs her chest)
Did you read that article in The
New York Times last Sunday? Severe
stress makes women age prematurely,
because the stress causes the DNA
in our cells to shrink until they
can no longer replicate. So when
we're stressed we look haggard.
Just women...not men. Remember
when they used to say single women
over 35 were more likely to be
killed by a terrorist than get
married? That was... horrible. So
now our generation is also not
getting married and bonus....real
terrorists actually became part of
our lives s0 now the stress of it
all shows up in our faces, making
us look haggard while Ethan goes on
looking cute forever and fucking
his 24 year old receptionist.

BRISTOL
I think a vacation sounds like a
solid idea.

INT. AMANDA'S HOME OFFICE
Amanda sits at her computer, googling vacation spots.

AMANDA
(typing)
Okay...where do I want to go? By
myself...at Christmas... By myself,
"depressed" at Christmas. All
alone on vacation. Alone,
alone...totally alone.

She stops typing. Tries to cry. Quivers her bottom lip,
quick breaths...she can't make tears. Stops trying.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
{reading what has shown up
on her screen)
Worry free vacations. Good. Where's
that?

Ican't. All couples and kids...

Yeah. Hole up in a house

weeks,...nobody'1l know me. Good.

Amanda CLICKS and a PHOTO of IRIS' COTTAGE SHOWS UP. She
smiles as we HEAR the sound of a TEA KETTLE GOING OFF:

CUT TO:
INT, IRIS' COTTAGE - SAME TIME

It's eight hours later in England and Iris is making a cup of
tea before bed. She looks wiped out. It's been a hard
night. A light snow falls outside the windows. She hears
her COMPUTER PING. She sits at the kitchen table and looks
at her laptop. It's a HOME EXCHANGE INSTANT MESSAGE. It
says:

I'M INTERESTED IN RENTING YOUR HOUSE. IS IT STILL AVAILABLE?

IRIS
Renting my house?

IRIS types back: Sorry, it's only available for home
exchange.

INT. AMANDA'S HOME OFFICE - SAME TIME

AMANDA

(to herself)
Home exchange??

(READS NEW MESSAGE FROM

IRIS)
We switch houses, cars, everything.
I haven't done it before but
friends of mine have. Supposed to
be great. Where are you?

TRIS

{staring at her computer)
Please say America.
22.

AMANDA types: Z.A.

ERIS (CONT'D)
Jackpot!

Wiping her tears, IRIS types: I've never been there but
always wanted to go. I'm Iris, by the way. I'm very normal.
Neat freak. Healthy. Non smoker. Single.
IRIS (CONT'D)
(to herself)
-- Hate my horrible life.
AMANDA types: I'm Amanda.
AMANDA
(to herself)
Loser, loner, complicated wreck.
IRIS types: Hu.
AMANDA answers: Hi.

AMANDA thinks abeut this, then writes: Must say, your house
looks idyilic. Just what I need.

IRIS types: Thank you. What does your place look like? I
don't need much...just love the idea of being 6090 miles from
here.

AMANDA answers quickly: I totally get that. My place is
nice -- little bigger than yours.

IRIS: Not hard to be.

AMANDA laughs, types: I have Three Bedrooms, Four Baths,
Kitchen, Family Room, Media Room...

IRIS
(reading all this)
Is she kidding?
AMANDA keeps going: Home office, Gym, Pool and Guest House.

Assuming this will never work, IRIS types: JI have a kitchen,
bedroom, bathroom, living room. That's it.

IRIS (CONT'D)
{to herself)
Nice knowing you.
AMANDA writes: Sounds perfect.

Both Women sit and look at their computers.
23.

IRIS types: And I have a dog.

AMANDA answers: That's cool.

Iris smiles.

AMANDA: Can I ask you one thing?

IRIS: Sure.

AMANDA: Are there any men in your town?

IRIS: Honestly?

AMANDA: Yes.

IRTS: Zero.

AMANDA: When can I come?

TRIS hesitates, then types: Tomorrow too soon???
AMANDA, going on impulse: Tomorrow's perfect actually.

IRIS quickly types: Okay, forms to fill cut, etc., but we're
on for two weeks, starting tomorrow.

Both Women SIT AND STARE at their computers. A little
nervous.

AMANDA: Can I call you to talk in person?
IRIS relaxes: Love if you would.

And as quickly as Iris types in her phone number and SENDS,
the PHONE RINGS. Iris picks it up.

IRIS (CONT'D)

INT. BRITISH ATR - COACH - DAY

The plane is boarding and through the Crowd of Passengers, we
see Iris making her way through the Coach Section to her
seat. Naturally, it's in the middle of three seats and the
seats on either side of her are empty. She settles into the
center seat, looks up and sees a great looking Italian Guy
looking at the seat right next to her. She can't believe her
luck. He smiles at her. She smiles back. He’s then joined
by his Beautiful Skinny Girlfriend who points him to the next
row.

Then, two very pleasing looking Women in their Fifties stop
at Iris' row and squeeze into the empty seats knocking her
24.

around a bit. Iris' Blackberry BEEPS. She checks it. It’s
from JASPER. It says:

EARD YOU HAVE LEFT FOR HOLIDAY !N LOTUS LAND. FIRST VACATION IN
FOUR YEARS /S TURNING POINT. { SALUTE YOU. HOW DO 1 REACH YOU?
JASPER.

Iris closes her eyes, trying to will willpower. Her eyes go
to the line: How do I reach you? Her eyes well up as she
writes back:

Dear Jasper, (she deletes the “Dear") Jasper, We both know
I need to fall out of love with you. Would be great if you
would let me try. xx. (Deletes the xx). Iris.

The Woman next to Iris has been reading over her shoulder and
pats Iris‘ arm.

ANOTHER BRITISH AIR FLIGHT - FIRST CLASS - NIGHT - IN FLIGHT
CLOSE ON A STACK OF BOOKS

The size you would take with you if you were going away for a
year. The stack sits next to Amanda who wears the British
Air Eye Shades, sweats, noisy bangle bracelets. Harper's
Bazaar lies open on her lap.

With her eyes covered, she takes a Pepsid AC, throws it down
with some water, rubs her chest and closes the window shade.
She pulls up the comforter, adjusts her pillow. A beat and
she lifts her eye shades to her forehead, stares straight up
at the plane's ceiling and we HEAR:

THAT FAMILIAR MOVIE TRAILER GUY'S
VOICE -

Amanda Woods is proud to present --

"Her Life". She had it all. The

job, the house, the guy. This

holiday season find out what Amanda

doesn't have.

As if to shut the Guy out, Amanda snaps her eye shades back
over her eyes.

A BRITISH PASSPORT

is STAMPED by a U.S. Customs officer. He hands it back to an
excited IRIS.

IRIS
Wish me luck!

The Customs Guy says nothing. Iris moves on. A beat and she
returns.
25.

IRIS (CONT'D)
I'm a little superstitious. Could
you wish me luck?

CUSTOMS OFFICER
Good luck.

ANOTHER STAMP

hits AMANDA'S PASSPORT. A British Customs Officer passes the
passport back to Amanda. She yawns, wearing sunglasses.

HELICOPTER SHOT - FREEWAYS INTERSECTING — DAY
A SAN DIEGO FREEWAY SIGN —- “SUNSET BOULEVARD" ~ DAY

IRIS, in the backseat of a TAXI, looks out the open window
like a kid, her hair blowing.

EXT. SURREY, ENGLAND - LATE DAY

A Mercedes drives through the picturesque village which is
now covered in snow.

INT. MERCEDES ~ MOVING

The DRIVER slows to a stop and turns to the backseat.. AMANDA
is asleep wearing the British Air eye shades.

DRIVER
Miss? Miss?

Amanda jumps, lifting her eyes shades.

DRIVER (CONT'D)
We're here.

Amanda lowers the window letting in the cold air. She looks
out at a snow covered stone wall.

AMANDA
(disoriented)
This can't be it.

DRIVER
(pointing the other way)
It's just down that lane, but I'll
never be able to turn at the other
end. Think you can make it from
here?

Amanda squints trying to see how long the lane is.
26.

AMANDA
No.

EXT. SNOW COVERED LANE

The Mercedes pulls away and leaves Amanda in heels, jeans,
shearling coat, a long red scarf, a Balenciaga bag, a carry
on, and a huge black Tumi suitcase. She tosses her scarf
over her shoulder, pops the handle on her suitcase and begins
dragging it behind her, down the snow covered lane. Whoops.
She skids, almost falls, regains her balance. A clump of snow
falls from a tree branch, hitting her smack on the head.

AMANDA
Thank you.

CLOSE — AMANDA'S SNOW COVERED MANOLOS

coming to a stop. Tilt up to Amanda, out of breath, arriving
at Iris' little gate. She wipes snow from the stone wall and
reveals the house number. She looks ahead and sees the TINY
COTTAGE, nestled under snow covered branches.

AMANDA
(to the house)
I'm here...

Amanda opens the gate, the bell on it rings a frozen little
ring and she drags her things up to the front door, lifts a
flower pot and finds a key.

She inserts the key and is greeted by Iris‘ dog, Charlie.
She pets him as she turns on the lights, looks around the
cottage, sees it's small, charming Bedroom with pitched
ceilings, tiny Bathroom, cramped Kitchen, cozy little Living
Room. Amanda stands between her bags, able to see the full
place as she does a 360.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
What am I doing here?

EXT. BRENTWOOD STREET - SAME TIME

The Taxi pulls away revealing Iris OUT FRONT OF AMANDA'S
GATE, holding her one smallish suitcase. She's overdressed
for a warm winter day in L.A. She stands beneath an orange
tree, the sun shining brightly on her as she looks through
the gate at Amanda's spread.

IRIS

Holy shit.

She presses a button on the CALL BOX.
27.

BRISTOL'S VOICE
Iris?

TRIS
(getting too close to the
box)
Yes. I'm here. Hello.

BRISTOL'S VOICE
Hey... Come on in.

Iris tries pushing on the gate when suddenly it automatically
swings open.

IRIS
(leans back to the box)
Sorry.

A wind greets her as she carries her suitcase up the gravel
driveway. Pregnant Bristol EXITS THE FRONT DOOR holding a
binder.

BRISTOL
Hi, I'm Bristol, I'm Amanda's
assistant. I'm really sorry to do
this but your plane was late and I
have a doctor's appointment, so
I've got to take off.

TRIS
Oh, no problem.

BRISTOL

Thanks. I made you this binder, it
explains how everything in the
house works. The alarm, the
password, the gate code...I gave
you all the speed diai numbers for
police, fire, gardeners, pool man,
housekeeper, me. Directions for
the phones, the sound system, the
TVs, DVD players and TiVos. The
equipment in the gym is pretty self
explanatory. The exterior lights
go on automatically and sco do the
sprinklers so you don't have to
worry about that. Here’s clickers
for the gate and the garage and
keys to the front door, the side
door, the mail box and the Prius.

{sees Iris’ expression)
Don’t worry. It's only a house.
It's easier than it looks.
28.

INT. HOUSE

Iris ENTERS, takes it all in...the beautiful decor, the large
generous rooms. Her mind is blown.

She places her things by the door and immediately checks out
the house. We follow her as she DARTS IN and OUT of rooms
SCREAMING FOR JOY. She runs UP THE STAIRS, ENTERS THE
LUXURIOUSLY LARGE BEDROOM, checks out the OVERSIZED BATHROOM
and SHRIEKS. She opens a door into a DREAM CLOSET. It's
insanely BIG. She sees her small English self in the large
closet mirror.

IRIS
(to her mirror image)
This is the most brilliant thing
that ever happened to you.

INT. IRIS' COTTAGE —- ENGLAND - THE SAME TIME

Amanda is finishing unpacking, trying to squeeze one more
thing into Iris' teeny tiny little closet. She gets it in
and slams the door closed. Now... what to do with her empty
suitcase. She rolls it under the bed.

AMANDA
Okay. Now what?

AMANDA EXITS THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
pulling her coat around her to keep warm. It's getting dark
She spots a garden bench, dusts off the snow. Sits on it.
The quiet is astounding.
AMANDA
I have not screwed up every
relationship I've been in!

She tries to CRY again. Really gives it her all. Nothing
comes. She tries again...waits. Nothing.

TRAILER GUY'S VOICE
Amanda was lost but she knew, in
the game of life...
She bolts off of the bench and out of FRAME.
CUT TO:
THE ROAD - AS SEEN THROUGH A MINI COOPER'S WINDSHIELD

Things are flying by fast and the trees on the side of the
road are way too close. A PUNK BAND blares from the Radio.
29.

AMANDA

is driving Iris' electric Blue Mini and has obviously never
driven on the left side of the road before. She pulls into:

THE TOWN

Whoa...hard to make the turn from the left. A few shoppers
browse past local shops and watch as the Mini fish tails into
the street. Small children run to their parents. Amanda
parks, gets out of the car, grabs her chest to catch her
breath.

AMANDA
(to kids)
Sorry.
(then)
Okay, that was hell.

She looks around...sees the Pub, the Post Office, the Book
Shop, the Butcher and the Market. As she heads toward the
market, she looks left and a car from the right almost hits
her. HONKKKK!!! She leaps out of its way.

INT. MARKET

small, very English. Bad Christmas music plays in the b.g.
Amanda pushes a small cart and drinks from a bottle of wine.
She loads up her cart with fresh baguettes, pastries, smoked
salmon, local cheeses, Christmas puddings.

CHECK OUT STAND
As a chubby Female Clerk rings up Amanda's goodies.

CLERK
Someone's having a party tonight.

AMANDA
Ch, yeah.

Amanda takes a swig out of the wine bottle.
INT. IRIS' COTTAGE - NIGHT

Amanda sits on Iris' bed, in pajamas and a big sweater and
her scarf, eating Christmas pudding and watching The Office
on a15" TV. She pops a Pepsid AC in her mouth and washes it
down with wine. The Office cuts to commercial and Amanda's TV
spot comes on. "This Christmas, Columbia Pictures is proud to
present..." Amanda watches, mouthing the words. Then at the
end -- twice as big and in red letters -- Christmas Day.
30.

AMANDA
And that's why I make the big
bucks.

LATER

Amanda makes a fire in the LIVING ROOM FIREPLACE. It's not
so @asy without the little gas knob. A LITTLE LATER, she
puts on a Supremes CD and sings along. "You can't hurry
love, no, you just got to wait." LATER, holding a glass of
wine, she looks at Iris' books, reading their
titles...there's so many of them. LATER STILL, with an open
book on her lap, Amanda sits on the couch, looking at
Charlie, the dog. They seem to be having a staring contest.

CUT To:
AMANDA'S SUITCASE
being tossed on the bed. Amanda throws in her clothes.
CUT TO:
A HOCKNEY POOL SPLASH

Iris swims laps in AMANDA'S POOL as the sun sets on a balmy
breezy winter day in Los Angeles.

INT. MEDIA ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Ixis, barefoot, in jeans, blouse, damp hair, scans Amanda's
WALL OF DVDs....there’s so many of them. Then, she looks at
a BASKET FULL OF CLICKERS...there's so many of them. She
gets intimidated and reaches for the binder Bristol gave her.
The Phone RINGS.

IRIS
(into phone)
Hello?
(notices "GATE" is LIT UP
on phone)
Gate? Oh, no. Disaster.

Iris looks at the multi-lined phone, then thumbs frantically
though the binder.

AN AUDI CONVERTIBLE - WAITS OUTSIDE THE GATE
Miles (from page 1) is behind the wheel. His Girlfriend,

Maggie sits next to him, talking on her cell. Miles is
listening to a movie score on CD.
31.

MAGGIE
(into phone)
No, Miles is dropping me at yoga.
Shut Uppp. Who was he with?

Maggie turns down the Volume on the CD.

MILES
Maggie! This is the best part.

Maggie holds up her finger as in “one sec". Miles PUSHES the
CALL BUTTON again.

IRIS' VOICE
(from the speaker box)
-- I'm sorry. Hello. I'm here.
Can you hear me?

MILES
It's Miles. Amanda?

IRIS'S VOICE
Wo. Sorry. Amanda's not here.
(BEEP }
-- Oh, FU!!
(BUZZ)

Miles and Maggie both look at the Speaker Box as the gate
OPENS.

IRIS' VOICE
If you heard that, I'm terribly
sorry.

Miles pulls into the driveway, GETS OUT of the convertible.
Maggie stays in the car, still on the phone. Iris opens the
door, sees Miles.

IRIS
Hello...

The afternoon breeze blows her hair as MOVIE MUSIC drifts out
of the car. It's nostalgic and romantic and colors the
scene.

MILES
Hi. Sorry to bother you...

The wind blows even stronger, rustling Iris' blouse.

MILES (CONT'D)
(Looking at the trees
blowing)
Santa Anas.
32

TRIS
Pardon?

MILES
The wind...it's what makes it so
warm this time of year. Legend has
it, when the Santa Anas blow,
anything can happen.

IRIS
Good day to arrive then.

MILES
You just got here?

IRIS
First time in L.A.

MILES

Really? Well, people bad mouth
this place all the time but give it
a chance. L.A. is highly
misunderstood. There's a lot of
magic around here. Plus, there
aren't many places where the nights
smell like jasmine and the days
smell like orange blossoms.

{the wind blows again)
I'm Miles, I work for Ethan.

IRIS
Amanda's ex-boyfriend?

MILES
Yeah. Too bad about that, huh..?
Do you know what time Amanda will
be back?

IRIS
Amanda's in England...on holiday.
I'm staying here for a few weeks
while she's gone.

MILES
Oh, that's a little funky ‘cause
Ethan left some things here and
asked me to pick them up. Is that
still cool, or...?

IRIS
You’re his...?
33.

MILES
Well, I'm a composer, like Ethan
but I help him out with whatever...

IRIS
{referring to the music
coming out of the car)
Did you compose this?

MILES
No, this is the great Ennio
Morricone, it's the score from
Cinema Paradiso.

IRIS
Oh. I loved that movie. I forgot
how beautiful the music was.

They both listen appreciatively when the horn HONKS. Miles
turns. Maggie is clearly ready to go.

TRIS (CONT'D)
Would it be all right if you came
around tomorrow and I'1l check all
this out with Amanda's assistant?

MILES

Sure. No problem. Thanks.
IRIS

(extends her hand)

I'm Iris.
MILES

Miles.
IRIS

Right.

The Santa Anas breeze past them again. As Miles gets back in
the car and pulls out the Exit Gate, Iris notices the orange
trees in the yard. As the wind drifts, she smells their
blossoms.

Arthur, (the Older Man introduced on page 2) slowly walks by
the open gate on a walker. Supporting his arm is his frumpy
iccking Black Nurse.

IRIS (CONT'D)
‘Evening...

Arthur does not look in her direction. Iris notices them
heading for the house next docr then spots a SMALL PACKAGE
34.

sitting outside the gate. Iris quickly rushes to it,
grabbing it just before the gate closes.

INT. KITCHEN — MOMENTS LATER

Iris opens THE PACKAGE, a vinyl cooler bag, and inside, finds
a small calorie conscious ZONE MEAL.

IRIS
Why would anyone with this kitchen
have a meal delivered?

Iris opens the Kitchen Cupboards. Nothing but low carb
foods, almonds, Pepcid AC, Mylanta. She opens the
refrigerator. Soy milk, one egg, 50 bottles of water, two
bottles of Pinot Grigio. Iris turns back and looks at the
Zone Meal.

WIDE SHOT - THE KITCHEN — MOMENTS LATER

This gorgeous, Viking-Ranged, Sub-Zeroed, every Williams—
Sonoma gadget-ever-made-kitchen has nothing in it to actually
eat so Iris SITS ON A STOOL at the HUGE ISLAND and dines on
Amanda's tiny ZONE MEAL and a glass of wine.

INT. AMANDA'S BEDROOM - LATER

We are CLOSE ON IRIS' LAPTOP SCREEN. We HEAR: "You've got
Mail!” with an English accent.

IRIS' E-MATLS

are displayed. Her eyes scan them and stop when she finds
what she wants. An e-mail from: JASPER_BLOOM@TIMES.CO.UK.
With her heart beating in great anticipation, she opens him
up.

JASPER'S E-MAIL
Know we must talk. Maybe it is
good you are on holiday. Give us
each a chance to deal with current
agendas. Trying hard to be clear
to myself these days. Know this...
I think of you and smile so deeply
that it can no longer be called a
smile. Maybe scientists will
discover new word to describe.
Sleep well. Jas

Her heart races. Her legs melt. How does he dc it? Six
thousand miles away and she’s still in the palm of his hand.
She braces herself and closes the computer.
35.

INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Iris climbs into Amanda's king size bed, looks at the clock.
It's SIX P.M.

TRIS
(counts quickly)
Seven, eight, nine ten, eleven,
twelve, one... Two a.m. in London.

She yawns, notices a BUTTON by the bed, pushes it and is
surprised when BLACK OUT BLINDS SIMULTANEOUSLY LOWER all
around the room, delivering the room into total darkness. As
the Screen turns BLACK, we HEAR:

IRIS (CONT'D)
He doesn't love you. Forget him.
Forget him.

ANOTHER CLOCK

tells us it’s TWO A.M. CAMERA PANS to Amanda, lying WIDE
AWAKE in Iris's small double bed. She's not even a little
tired. Suddenly, a LOUD KNOCKING on the FRONT DOOR. Amanda
quickly rises, runs into the LIVING ROOM. Charlie barks.

AMANDA
(cautiously)
Who is it?

MAN'S VOICE
It's me. Open up, it's freezing.

AMANDA
Who are you?

MAN'S VOICE
Iris...It's Graham. Open the
fucking door before I take a
fucking leak in your fucking flower
pot.

Amanda quickly OPENS the door and we find the rakishly
handsome GRAHAM (from page 2). All twinkly eyes and ruffled
hair. He's some exotic and pleasing concoction of
helplessness and cockiness. Just at the sight of him, Amanda
is for the first time in her life, speechless -- which means
this man has already changed her.

GRAHAM
(clearly drunk)
You're not Iris.
36.

AMANDA
No, I'm not.

GRAHAM
Oh...then, sorry for my profanity,
I wasn't expecting...you.

AMANDA
I~I wasn't expecting you either.

GRAHAM
Nevertheless...May I just....

AMANDA
Oh, yes, you have to um....

GRAHAM
(ENTERING)
Yes, I do...
(passing her, shakes her
hand)
I'm Graham. iris' brother.

AMANDA
Amanda Woods. I'm... staying here.

GRAHAM
Amandawoods...Is that all one word?

AMANDA
(watching him disappear
into the bathroom)
No. No it's not.

The Bathroom Door shuts. Amanda catches herself in the
mirror. She tries to fix her hair a little when Graham re-
enters. God, he's even cuter the second time you see him.

GRAHAM
(locking around)
So Iris is... Where is she?

AMANDA
She didn't tell you?

GRAHAM
Not that I remember.

AMANDA
She's in L.A..

GRAHAM
That's not possible. Iris never
leaves town.
37

AMANDA

(laughs)
Neither do I. She listed this
cottage on a Home Exchange Website.
I found it and we switched
houses...for two weeks. For
vacation. She's in my house in
L.A. and I'm here.

GRAHAM
No.... People actually do that?
AMANDA
Apparently. Seems here I am... in
my pajamas.
GRAHAM

She did call me a few times this

morning but I didn't get a chance

to get back to her. Feel awful now.
(a bit woozy)

Do you mind if I sit, I feel I'm

going to bump in to you.

AMANDA
~- No, no. Sure...sit...
(Graham sits on the sofa)
You okay?

GRAHAM

Oh, yes, fine. Really sorry about
the intrusion. Obviously, I had no
idea about this exchange thing and
although I may not appear it, I am
actually Iris' very respectable big
brother, however, on the rare, or
not so rare occasion that I come
into town and get inordinately
pissed, my sweet sister, puts me up
so I don't get behind the wheel.
Pathetic explanation but,
unfortunately it's become a bit of
a routine...

(to dog)
Hello Charles.

Charlie nuzzles Graham’s leg.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
So how's it going so far...this
exchange thing... I mean, up until
I showed up and ruined your night.
AMANDA
Actually it's not going so great.
I'm leaving tomorrow. On a noon
plane.

GRAHAM
Oh. When did you get here?

AMANDA
Uh, three o'clock. Today.

GRAHAM
Abhh. We made a great impression
on you, have we?

AMANDA
It's not that....no, it's just that
I'm not quite myself right now and
I came here on a stupid whim.
Honestly, I never thought about
anything less, very unlike me...and
the thing is, I don't know what I'm
doing here... so E thought I should
go home...where I at least know how
to drive a car. Would you like
something to drink? Glass of
water? Tea? Wine maybe?

GRAHAM
Wine would be good. Will you have
a glass?

AMANDA

-- Uh...sure.

38.

Amanda crosses to the Kitchen, brings over an open bottle and

two glasses.

GRAAEM
Thank you. I'm really sorry but 1
forgot your name?

AMANDA
Amanda.

GRAHAM
Yes. Amanda Woods. Very good name.
It looks like you.

He makes a fist, indicating she appears strong.
to him.

She sits next
She's not

AMANDA
You think I'm...
(she imitates his fist)
Really?

GRAHAM
Well, I imagine everybody does,
don't they?

AMANDA
Yes, but they don't usually spot it
this fast. Anyway, I don't feel
BSOe seve
(makes the fist)
Whatever. Like it matters.

GRAHAM
Are you married?

AMANDA
Married? No, no... No. I'm not.
No.... No.

GRAHAM
That makes two of us.

quite sure where this is headed.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
So, is it horrible if I stay? Z'li
be gone before you even wake up. I
promise you will never lay eyes on
me again.

AMANDA
No, sure, it's fine. Let me just
get you a blanket.

GRAHAM
It's in the cupboard there...on top
of the scrabble.

Amanda takes out the blanket and an extra pillow and hands
them to Graham.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
So why is it that you aren't guite
yourself? I'm sort of curious.

AMANDA
oh, why..?
{sitting again)
Because I...I just broke up with
someone...yesterday and I guess
(MORE)
40

AMANDA (CONT'D)
what I was feeling was that I
didn't want to be alone over the
holidays and I thought if I was
somewhere else, maybe I wouldn't
realize I was alone but then I got
here and I've never felt more alone
in my life. Big surprise.

(embarrassed)

Bet you're glad you knocked on this
door?

GRAHAM
T am actually.

AMANDA
Yeah. Well. Sorry and good night.

Graham leans over and kisses her. Almost routinely.

GRAHAM
Sweet dreams.

She digests this, then:
AMANDA
Do you think you could... Would you
mind... trying that again?

He kisses her again.

GRAHAM
Bad?

AMANDA
Weird. I mean, kissing a total
stranger.

GRAHAM

Really? I do it all the time.
She leans in, kisses him. Something's not working.

AMANDA
Maybe if I shut my eyes.

She shuts her syes and Graham kisses her closed eye lids
then kisses her on the mouth. Amanda's eyes open.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
You know, um...given that I'm in a
bit of a personal crisis and find
myself in a total stranger's home
in a town I can't actually remember
the name of and considering you
showed up and you're insanely good

(MORE)
4)
AMANDA (CONT'D)
looking and really drunk and
probably won’t remember me anyway,
I'm thinking.... we should have
sex. If you want.

He looks at her hard.

GRAHAM
That's a fantastic proposition.
AMANDA
Yeah...but I’m serious.
GRAHAM
So am I.
AMANDA

And not that it matters, but I've
never said anything like that in my
life. I've had nearly a bottle of
wine myself and it's just ... the
whole knowing I'll never see you
again thing is sort of exciting.
This is what a vacation is supposed
to be, right? You're supposed to
vacate your life. Do the
unexpected.

GRAHAM
You know this all sounded really
wonderful until I became the cabana

boy.

AMANDA
And you're funny. Which is a real
bonus.

GRAHAM
Yes, well, never meet me when I'm
sober.

AMANDA
Deal.

He pauses, thinks about that, then kisses her.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
Also I should warn you...I'm not
very good at this.

GRAHAM
"This" being?

AMANDA
Um. Sex.
42.

GRAEAM
Oh that can't be true.

AMANDA
I know. I look like I'm hot
but...I'm apparently net. It's
what I've been told.

GRAHAM
That's harsh.

AMANDA

I agree. Wevertheless, the guy I
was living with, mentioned it once
or twice. A girl doesn't forget a
comment like that. Not even me.
But I mean, how bad could I
be...sex is pretty basic. Am I
pretty much talking you out of it?

GRAHAM
Strangely, not at all. How do you
feel about foreplay?

AMANDA
I think it's overrated.
Significantly...overrated.

GRAHAM
You are quickly becoming one of the
most interesting girls I've ever
met.

Amanda rises, grabs the wine bottle and walks to the stereo,

turns it on, then walks backwards, facing Graham, leading him
into the bedroom. Graham follows her, unbuttoning his shirt

as he goes.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)

Look at you, you're already better

than you think.
EXT, COTTAGE - MORNING
Smoke drifts from the fireplace.
INT. KITCHEN
Amanda, now in a robe, is trying to figure out the coffee
maker when Graham tentatively ENTERS FROM THE BEDROOM, fully
dressed.

GRAHAM
Sood merning.
43,

AMANDA

(shyly)
Good morning.

She continues futzing with the coffee maker.

GRAHAM
Can I help you with that?

AMANDA
I should know how to do this...

Graham plugs it in.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
Ah, you have te plug them in over
here...

Graham laughs. They're quite close tc each other which makes
them both a little uncomfortable. Graham opens a cupbcard,
takes out a bottle of Tylenol. Takes two.

GRAHAM
Care for one?

AMANDA
I already had four.

GRAHAM
So...Amanda...I just want to...

AMANDA
Yeah, listen... You don't have to
worry about a thing here. Okay?

GRAHAM
(unsettled)
Okay...

AMANDA
I mean it was great meeting you and
everything.

GRAHAM
(seriously)
Definitely.
(then)
And, just for the record, your ex-
boyfriend is, in my opinion, quite
mistaken about you.

AMANDA
Yeah, well, you were drunk.
AA,

GRAHAM
Not that drunk.

Graham's cell phone RINGS. It's on the table, near Amanda.
She picks it up. Sees it says, SCPHIE is calling.

AMANDA
(hands it to him)
Sophie...
GRAHAM
(embarrassed, turns it
off)

I'll call her back...

Amanda nods, opens the cupboards looking for the coffee cups
Graham opens the correct cupboard, hands one to her.

AMANDA

You don't want one?
GRAHAM

I should really be going.
AMANDA

Sure.
GRAHAM

-- Listen, I know you don't want to
get involved...and you're leaving
today and just so you know, I have
rather enormous issues of my own
and even if you were staying, I can
promise you, you wouldn't for one
minute like...

AMANDA
(stopping him)
-~ You don't have to do this. I'm
damaged in this area myself. And
anyway, I mean..-honesty, we hardly
know each other.

GRAHAM
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.
Anyway, I just wanted to assure
you, you're better off.

AMANDA
Okay.

GRAHAM
No need to go on. Right. Well, I
just wanted to be sure you are ckay
(MORE)
45
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
because I'm somewhat emotionally
dysfunctional at this point in my
life and it seems I tend to hurt
women simply by being myself.

AMANDA
I'm not going to fall in love with
you. I promise.

GRAHAM
Okay. Nicely put. Thank you.

AMANDA
I mean, I know myself. I'm not
sure I even fall in love. Not like
the way other people do. How's that
for something to admit?

GRAHAM
Well, like I said, Most Interesting
Girl Award.

AMANDA.
I'm going to try to see that as a
compliment.

GRAHAM

You should.

(putting on his coat and

scart)
Okay, se, this is refreshing.
Utter honesty. Alright then, so
you probably won't be hearing from
me because even if you wanted to,
which you clearly don't...I have
the classic male problem of no
follow through. Absolutely never
remember to call after a date....
But... as this wasn't a date, I
guess I'm off the hook.

AMANDA
Exactly.

GRAHAM
(takes a sec...)
But what if I wanted to call you?

Amanda doesn't know what to say.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
Right. Well, if your flight is
cancelled or you change your
mind...I'm meeting some friends in
(MORE)
46.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
the pub in town tonight...and if
not...then....Well...You're lovely.

She crosses to him.

AMANDA
So are you.

They hug.
INT. HEATHROW ATRPORT - LATER

Canned Christmas music plays as Camera finds Amanda at the
HEAD OF A LONG LINE OF PASSENGERS.

She stands across the table from a Uniformed Guard in latex
gloves routinely feeling around the edges of her open
suitcase. She watches as he starts to unzip her make up bag.
She CLOSES HER EYES and HEARS and SEES the trailer version of
her life continuing.

QUICK CUT - AMANDA WALKING THE SNOWY LANE WITH HER SUITCASE

TRAILER GUY'S VOICE
She wasn't looking for love.

QUICK CUT —- AMANDA OPENING THE DOOR AND SEEING GRAHAM.

TRAILER GUY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
But that doesn't mean it didn't
find her.

QUICK CUT - AMANDA & GRAHAM KISSING AGAINST THE BEDROOM WALL
BACK TO REALITY

Amanda realizes her suitcase has passed inspection. She
moves along in line.

cur TO:
A BLACK SCREEN

We hear fumbling then the BUZZ of the BLINDS BEING RAISED.
We’re in AMANDA'S BEDROOM IN BRENTWOOD. Iris just woke up.
As her eyes adjust, she sees her fantastic surroundings and a
huge smile crosses her face. She remembers she's happy. She
hits a button on the Bose cD player on the night table and
Aerosmith blasts through the reom. She begins to dance
around while still lying under the covers. Her cell phone
RINGS. She lowers the Music.

IRIS
(cheerfully into phone)
Hello.
47.

JASPER'S VOICE
Where am I finding you?

IRIS
(stunned, sobered)
Jasper?

JASPER'S VOICE
Is it okay that I'm calling you?

IRIS
I guess... How are you?

JASPER'S VOICE
Could we start with a less
complicated question?

IRIS
{laughs but cautious)
What's wrong?

JASPER'S VOICE
How long are you going to be there?

IRIS
Two weeks. Why?

JASPER'S VOICE
I guess I can wait, but I'm having
some real problems with this
section of my book. I could use
some Iris.

(Iris starts to deflate)
Would it be awful to send you some
pages? Just tell me if it is.

I don't want to mess you up but I
know you're the only one who can
help me.

IRIS
Well, I mean, if you need me...

Iris hits the BLACK OUT BUTTON again and the BLINDS start to
LOWER. As she SLOWLY GOES INTO DARKNESS, their conversation
continues.

JASPER'S VOICE
You know you're my little survival
kit.
(Iris SIGHS)
Now, honey, I want you to promise
me you'll have fun today, okay?
48.

TRIS
(from TOTAL DARKNESS)
Okay. I'll do my best.

INT. SURREY PUB - ENGLAND - NICHT

The pub is smoxy, noisy and packed too tight. Graham ENTERS,
his face red from the cold, scarf around his neck. His eyes
scan the place for Amanda. She's not there. He hides his
disappointment, then brightens when he finds his friends, a
COUPLE his age, at a table in the back. He joins his friends
and orders a drink. His friend says something to make him
laugh, which he does wistfully. As he takes off his scarf,
he looks up and sees Amanda through the crowd, sitting at the
bar, watching him. He breaks into a smile.

CUT TO:
POV OF BRENTWOOD STREET ~ MOVING - LATE DAY
From the windshield of Amanda's Prius.

GPS VOICE
Turn left in 50 feet.

IRIS
(imitating the voice)
Thank you very much...

IRIS drives, eating potato chips. She turns a corner and
passes her elderly neighbor, Arthur, walking alone. He seems
dost. Iris drives past him slowly, looks at him in her rear
view mirror then backs up, gets out, approaches him. She
speaks to him as if he's not only old but deaf.

IRIS (CONT'D)
Excuse me, but... may I offer you a
lift home?

ARTHUR
(matter of fact)
Why? You know where I live?

TRIS
I believe I do. Yes.

ARTHUR
Good, then that makes one of us.

Surprised by his sharpness, Iris opens the passenger door,
places Arthur's walker in the backseat then helps Arthur in
to the front seat. Iris runs back to the driver's side,
jumps in, starts driving. Arthur removes something from his
seat.
IRIS

(taking it}
oh, sorry. Movie Star map. I was
sightseeing all day. Did you know
Antonic Banderas, Goldie Hawn,
Duetin Hoffman and Arnold
Schwartzenedger all live within a
mile of here?

ARTHUR
No, I did not.

IRTS
I don't know if it's true, but it's
what the map said. I'm staying at
the house right next door to you.

ARTHUR
Which one? The brick monstrosity
or the one behind the gates no one
can see.

IRIS
I'm in the one behind the gates.

ARTHUR
Yeah? How is it back there?

IRIS
Beautiful actually. This is you,
right here, isn't it?

Iris pulls into Arthur's driveway. He lives in a classic

Spanish Hacienda with a neatly groomed lawn.

ARTHUR
Had no idea I was so close.

IRIS
Your house is quite lovely. Looks
a little like Spielberg's house
but...

ARTHUR
~- Smaller?

iRIS
(laughs)
Just a little.

ARTHUR
I've lived here 47 years. Back
then there were only 6 houses on
this block. Every year, they tear
(MORE)
50.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
another one down...not that I blame
them...they weren't great to begin
with but that's how I got confused,
didn't recognize one house.

TRIS
That would be confusing.

ARTHUR
What part of England are you from?

IRIS
Surrey.

ARTHUR
Cary Grant was from Surrey.

TRIS
That's right, he was. How'd you
know that?

ARTHUR
He told me once. Well, I thank you
very much young lady...

Arthur can't find the door handle, keeps feeling for it.

TRIS
You are very welcome. Let me help
you with that.

Iris runs around to Arthur's side, opens the door, helps him
out, hands him his walker and escorts him up the path toward
hie house.

ARTHUR

Well, this was some meet cute.
IRIS

Sorry?
ARTHUR

It's how two characters meet in a
movie. Say a man and a woman both
need something to sleep in and both
go to the same Men's Pajama
Department. The man says to the
salesman, "I just need bottoms” and
the woman says, "I just need a
top". They look at each other and
that's it. That's the meet cute.
This isn't quite that cute, but...

IRIS
So, you're in the film business?
ARTHUR
Was. Yes I was. I was a writer.

They've arrived at Arthur's FRONT DOOR. Arthur takes out his
key, his hand shakes as he tries to get it in the keyhole.
Iris watches as he repeatedly tries to insert the key.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I could be here 'til tomorrow.

IRIS
(snapping to)
Oh. Sorry. Let me help you.

Iris takes the key, opens the door and helps Arthur in.
INT. ARTHUR'S HOUSE

Faded seventies decor. Iris peeks through the rooms, sees an
office with lots of books, a cluttered desk, an electric
typewriter and sitting in front of a window, amongst assorted
knick-knacks -- a dusty Oscar. Stunned, Iris turns her
attention back to Arthur who is slowly turning on a lamp.

IRIS
Well... Um...Good-bye then. I
enjoyed our meet cute.

ARTHUR
I thank you for rescuing me.

IRIS

Pleasure...absolutely.

{notices a lousy looking

dinner on a tray)
You know...I hope you don't find
this strange, but I've just arrived
in town, don't really know anyone
and I was thinking of going out to
dinner tonight...if you're not
busy, would you like to join me?

ARTHUR
Busy? Honey, I haven't been busy
since 1978.
INT. KATE MANTELLINI - NIGHT

Iris and Arthur sit in a booth by the window, mid-meal. Both
are drinking beer.
52

IRIS
So that was your first job in
Hollywood? Louis B. Mayer's cffice
boy? That's amazing.

ARTHUR
Actually, my first job was as a
Western Union messenger. That's
how I met Mayer. I delivered a
telegram to his office at MGM.
When I walked in, the girls in the
office were all in a tizzy...their
office boy didn't show up and the
boss was screaming. I volunteered
for the jcb and the next day I was
on the payroll. I was seventeen
years old.

IRIS
Wow. Then how long after that did
you become a screenwriter?

ARTHUR
Well, you gotta remember, there was
no such thing as film school back
then. You learned by being there.
I met everybody working in Mayer's
office -- all the big stars, the
directors... But the ones who
impressed me were the writers.
They were witty, sophisticated guys
with huge intellects... not to
mention, they got all the great
women. So I started writing and
before long I was in the writer's
building. They gave me a lovely
office, a desk, a secretary, a big
davenport. I never wanted to leave.

IRIS
So Hollywood really was as great
back then as I imagine.

ARTHUR

It was better...
(takes a good look at her)

You know what I've been asking
myself all night? Why would a
beautiful girl like you go to a
stranger's house for her Christmas
vacation and on top of that, spend
her Saturday night with an old
cocker like me. That's gotta be a
story.
53

IRIS

Oh, because I just wanted to get
away from the people I see all the
time.... Well, not all the people.
One person... I wanted to get away
from...one...guy....ome old
boyfriend...whoe just got engaged...

(her eyes fill up)
and forgot to tell me...

ARTHUR
-. So, he's a schmick.

IRIS
(laughs, wiping her eyes)
As a matter of fact, he is. How did
you know?

ARTHUR

He let you go. This is not a hard
one to figure out.

{Iris locks up surprised,

her eyes still watery)
Iris, in the movies, we have
leading ladies and we have the best
friend. You, I can tell, are a
leading lady but for some reason,
you're acting like the best friend.

IRIS
(tearful)
I've been in therapy for three
years and my dector has never
explained anything to me that well.

ARTHUR
You don’t live to be my age,
without learning something.

Arthur hands Iris his handkerchief. She wipes her eyes.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
So, maybe one day while you're
here, I'il take you for a drive and
show you the old Hollywood. The
one I knew.

IRIS
Would you really? What about now?
Bre you too tired?
54.

ARTHUR
I haven't been out of the house at
this hour in years. Now you want
to go for a drive?

TRIS
Well, only if you want to.

POV OF THE SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - MOVING

Billboards for Gucci, iPod, Skyy Vodka. Bright and brash.
IRIS DRIVES AMANDA'S CAR

at a steady pace. Arthur sits next to her.

ARTHUR
Okay, look up here on the right.
That was The Trocadero. The
swankiest. of the swank. Black tie
every night. I first laid eyes on
my wife right there. It was
raining. She was standing under an
umbrella in a satin dress the color
of champagne.

Iris LOOKS OVER at the SPOT where the Trocadero was and sees
AN EMPTY PARKING LOT next to Chin Chin. Arthur doesn't seem
To see the empty lot as he looks out at it and smiles to
himself.

DRIVING
ARTHUR
All right, over here, that was
Ciro's.
IRIS

I've heard of that.

ARTHUR
Anyone who was anyone went to
Ciro's. They had a terrific
orchestra. And great fights brceke
eut at Ciro's. Every night ended
with a black eye. It was
tremendous.

iris looks over and sees THE COMEDY STORE where Ciro's used
to be.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Okay, now, this place was owned by
the great Preston Sturges.
55.

Iris LOOKS OUT her window and sees MIYAGI'S a large JAPANESE
RESTAURANT.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
It used to be called The Player's
Club. He opened it in the summer
of 1940 and if he felt like closing
down for the night and just
antertaining his cronies, that's
what he did. To me, this was the
hilt.

Arthur stares up at the Player's Club and for a split second,
SEES IT AS IT ONCE WAS: 1940's Packards and Caddies lining
the curb and elegantly dressed Men and Women entering the
front door.

Tris looks over at Arthur. He realizes he's been day
dreaming.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I think that's enough, kid. I'm
pooped.

IRIS
Yeah. Me too.

They drive in silence. The neon bouncing off the windshield.

ARTHUR
On the way home, we'll take a
little detour. I'll show you
Bogart's house.

IRIS
Great.

EXT. ROLLING HILLS - SURREY ~- EARLY MORNING
An early mist drifts over the snowy fields.
INT. IRIS' LITTLE KITCHEN

This time it's Graham at the Coffee maker. He's wearing last
night's clothes. He hears a loud CL y an "Ouch!!!" from
the Bedroom and then Charlie skids out of the room. Then,
Amanda STUMBLES IN, locking ship wrecked. She holds onto the
docr frame.

AMANDA
I haven't had that much to drink
in... What am I saying? I've
never had that much to drink.
56.

GRAHAM
Yes... I believe no one ever has.

AMANDA
The last thing I remember was
coming in here last night and--

She spots her bra perched on a lamp shade. She shrieks, then
looks up at Graham.

GRAHAM
T had nothing to do with that.

AMANDA
(embarrassed to death)
But you were here.

GRAHAM
(smiles)
I was.

AMANDA
(pointing to bedroom)
Then I guess we...
(Graham shakes his head
"no’)
We didn't?

GRAHAM
We did not.

AMANDA
Thank God... I mean, act “thank
God" but just thank God because I
didn't remember doing it. All I
remember is waking up to Charlie
licking my toes.

GRAHAM
Now that was me actually.
AMANDA
It was not!
GRAHAM
No, it wasn't.
AMANDA
{getting it straight)
Was not.
GRAHAM

Was not. I was...kidding.
Obviously not very well.
57.

AMANDA
So now why didn't we...? Can you
remind me a little?

GRAHAM
Amanda, call me old fashioned but
one does not have sex with women
who are unconscious.

AMANDA
Unconscious. Oh. That must've
been attractive. Why did you stay?

GRAHAM
Because you asked me to.

AMANDA
(remembering)
Oh, I did. Didn't I? Oh, man...

GRAHAM
From the moment I met you, it's
been an adventure.

AMANDA
Yes and I'm deeply sorry about
that. I have nothing to say for
myself other than, I must be
temporarily nuts right now...it’s
the holidays, I'm jet lagged ..I'm
obviously still reacting to this
break up or meeting you or...

Graham's cell phone RINGS. It is on the table closest to
Amanda. She picks it up, reads it.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
Olivia. Sorry. I didn’t mean to
look.

GRAHAM
I should probably take this one.

Graham very warmly says "Hello" as he EXITS OUT THE FRONT
DOOR. Amanda WATCHES GRAHAM THROUGH THE WINDOW, talking on
his cell in the FRONT YARD. He's laughing. Amanda can't
help but feel a little jealous.

AMANDA
(to herself)
Olivia. Sophie. Amanda... Busy
guy...

Amanda pours herself a cup of coffee as Graham RE-ENTERS.
58.

GRAHAM
I think we should go into town.

AMANDA
What do you mean?

GRAHAM
I think you should get dressed, we
should take a drive, get some lunch
and get to know each other.

AMANDA
Really? Why?
GRAHAM

Because I'm running out of reasons
why we shouldn't. Aren't you?

INT. RANGE ROVER -— MOVING - DAY
Graham drives. The classic winter landscape of the English
countryside whizzes by... a distant castle, rolling hills.

Amanda looks over at Graham, and unlike Ethan, he looks back
and smiles. Their eyes connect.

EXT. VILLAGE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Graham and Amanda walk past the local shops. A Young Camilla
Parker-Bowles type passes carrying groceries.

WOMAN
(surprised to see him)
Graham. .i
GRAHAM
{not pausing as they pass
her)
Cynthia...

Cynthia stops, checks Amanda out.

Amanda and Graham pass by the BUTCHER SHOP. The YOUNG FEMALE
BUTCRER can be seen THROUGH THE WINDOW. Both the Female
Butcher and her OLDER FEMALE CUSTOMER turn to see Graham and
Amanda pass. Graham nods to them both. The Customer reaches
on her tippy toes to see them better. Amanda notices.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
(explaining)
very small village...

Another Woman, Amanda's age, passes, pushing a toddler ina
stroller. .
59.

YOUNG WOMAN
(very friendly)
Hey, look who's...

GRAHAM
Yes, how ‘bout that.

The Toddler cranes her neck out of the stroller to watch
them. Graham grabs Amanda's hand and quickens their pace.

At a stoplight, a real Knock Out sits behind the wheel of her
Jaguar XK. She glares at Graham. He waves politely. She
gives him the finger.

INT. GRAHAM'S RANGE ROVER -~ DRIVING - FAST

They're back on the open road.

GRAHAM
I have a much better place to take
you.

AMANDA
Somewhere maybe a little less
crowded?

GRAHAM

Less crowded and also much more
less crowded.

EXT. BABINGTON HOUSE - DAY

The Range Rover drives down a long country lane, bracketed by
enormous oak trees. At the end of the lane, a quiet Country
Estate turned COUNTRY HOTEL.

INT. BABINGTON HOUSE RESTAURANT - DAY

Amanda and Graham sit across from one another in this idyllic
spot. A fire crackles in the fireplace.

AMANDA

So... you're a book editor?
GRAHAM

Yes I am.
AMANDA

In London I presume?

GRAHAM
I commute every day except when I'm
actually editing, then I work at
home. It's why I live out here, I
(MORE)
60.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
couldn't live in London any more
and get things done. Too many
distractions.

AMANDA
Seems to me there's no shortage cf
distractions out here.

GRAHAM
That’s not entirely true.

AMANTA
So what kind of an editor are you?

GRAHAM
A very mean one.

AMANDA
No, what I meant was, do you give
massive notes or..?

GRAHAM
Well, the better the writer, the
less notes I have to give.

AMANDA
Right. And what did you study in
schooi?

GRAHAM
Literature.

AMANDA
Did you always know this waa what
you wanted to do?

GRAHAM
Okay, my palms are starting to
sweat, I feel like I'm on a job
interview.

AMANDA
I know. I'm interrogating you. I'm
sorry. I haven't been on a first
date in a long time.

GRAHAM
Well, since we've already had sex
and slept together twice, I think
we can bend the first date rules.
Why are you blushing?

AMANDA
I don't know. I think you make me
nervous. I'm going to try to he

myself with you...never easy, but
I'm going to try.

a deep breath.

GRAHAM
Ckay, we're doing well. Now what
was the question? Oh, did I always
know I wanted to be a book editor.
The answer is... Yes I did. My
family's in publishing. My
father's a writer of historical
fiction and my mother was and is to
this day, a very important editor
at Random House.

AMANDA
Wow. So you grew up with a busy,
important, working Mom.

GRAHAM
Yes I did. She's very formidable.
May be the best there is at the job
and doesn't let you forget it.

AMANDA
Are your parents still together?

GRAHAM
My parents are not only still
together, they are still madiy in
love. Hideously so.

AMANDA
Why hideously so?

GRAHAM
Because, honestly, it borders on
obscene. They're old and they've
been spotted making out while
walking the dogs. They call each
other ten times a day. They set
the bar very high when it comes to
relationships and commitment which
could explain my sister in love
with a man who does not even
appreciate her and of course, my
disastrous romantic life. Okay,
believe your time's up. Your turn.

AMANDA
Well, like I said the other night,
I own a company that does movie
advertising.
62

GRAHAM
I didn't realize you owned the
company.

AMANDA

That's because I probably didn't
mention it but now that I know you
were raised by such a strong
working mother, I can say it and
maybe you won't be intimidated by
it.

GRAHAM
No, no, I'm still a little
intimidated by it.

AMANDA
Well, "a little” is way ahead of
the curve.

GRAHAM
What about your family?

AMANDA
My parents broke up when I was 15.
It was, at the very least...the
defining event of my life. I'm an
only child and I just didn't see it
coming. We were very close, we
used to call ourselves The Three
Musketeers and then one night,
after dinner, my parents sat me
down and told me they were breaking
up. I thought they were kidding,
then I saw a suitcase out of the
corner of my eye. In the hallway.
My Dad moved out that night. I
think I cried myself to sleep for
months. Then I realized I had to
toughen up so I refused to let
myself cry. Sort of haven't cried
since. I also haven't thought of
that packed suitcase maybe ever.

GRAHAM
You haven't cried since you were
fifteen? Really?

AMANDA
I know it must mean something
awful. I know. And I try but it's
like something just permanently
shut off in there. Anyway, my
Dad's remarried and my Mom's still
(MORE)
63.
AMANDA (CONT'D)
single...of course but she's very
strong. This has had its effect on
me. Obviously. I'm still talking
about it 17 years later...
(rubs her chest)
Can't we talk about you some more?

GRAHAM
(bailing her out)
Yes. Absolutely. Okay. Well...1
ery all the time.

AMANDA
You do not.

GRAHAM
Yes Ido. I cry more than any
woman you've ever met.

AMANDA
You don't have to be this nice.

GRAHAM
I happen to be telling the truth.
A good book, a great film, the
opera... I more than cry. I weep.
I'm a major weeper. It's pathetic,
is what it is. Strangers have made
fun of me...

Amanda softens and as MUSIC BEGINS we DISSOLVE THROUGH TO the
REST OF TEE THETR MEAL, their conversation is lively and
warm. DISSOLVE TO LATER and Graham moves his seat from across
the table to next to Amanda on the banquette. LATER, THEY
WALK THE SNOW COVERED GROUNDS... sit on a snow covered
hillside, lean back and kiss, the snow creating a blanket
underneath them.

EXT. IRIS' COTTAGE - LATE DAY
The Rangé Rover pulls up to the cottage.

INT. RANGE ROVER

AMANDA
You're right. This was a great
idea.
(Graham TURNS OFF the car)
You don't have to... walk me in...

I mean, it’s freezing and...

GRAHAM
-- You can just say you don't want
me to come in.
64.

AMANDA
It’s not that, I'm just tired, I
think I'm gonna take a nap and...
(sees his reaction)
It's not that.

GRAHAM
Okay, I'll pretend I believe you.

AMANDA
Graham, I'm leaving in nine days
and that makes this complicated and
I'm not sure I can handle
complicated right now.

Graham nods. She kisses him. He holds back. She kisses him
again.

GRAHAM
And that doesn't make it
complicated?

AMANDA
Sex makes everything complicated.
Even when you don't have it, the
not having it makes things
complicated.

GRAHAM
Which is why it's usually better to
have it. -- Some say.
(she laughs but doesn't
bite)
Okay, it's bloody freezing.

He turns the car back on.

AMANDA
I know, I'm gonna sieep in my coat
and possibly my boots...

GRAHAM
We're back to being awkward with
each other. Did you see this
coming?

AMANDA
Graham, you're a book editor from
London, I make trailers in L.A..
A long distance relationship would
just baffle me but I do find you
really attractive and sexy.
Incredibly attractive and sexy.
GRAHAM
Yes, well, saying it twice helps.
Well... I'm off to work in the
morning. I promise I won't be
drunkenly banging on your door any
time soon.

AMANDA
Do IT have your number?

GRAHAM
I'm in the directory.

AMANDA
Great. And you obviously have the
number here. So, we'll see each
other, okay? We'll figure
something out.

GRAHAM
Good.

Amanda gets out of the car, shivers, making him laugh, then

runs into the house. Graham sits there, thinking.
HEAR a DOORBELL.

AND A DOOR OPENS - IN L.A.

And Miles is on the other side of it, holding a Fed Ex

package.

MILES
Hello. Bad timing?

Iris, on the other side of the door. Happy to see him.

TRIS
No, come on in. Hi.
MILES
How's it going?
TRIS
I'm good, I'm good.
MILES
This Fed Ex was leaning on the

gate.
{reads it)
From London, England.

TRIS
{opening the Fed Ex)
Oh, a friend of mine is writing a

book and I give him notes
sometimes.

Inside the Fed Ex are about 20 typed pages with a NOTE CARD
paper-clipped on the front.

INSERT - THE NOTE CARD - JASPER BLOOM STATICNARY

But the card is blank. Iris turns the card over. Also
blank. Iris pales a bit then places the package on the
table.

Miles hears VOICES FROM THE KITCHEN.

MILES
You have company?

IRIS
Oh. I'm having a little Chanukah
party.

MILES

What did you... join a temple since
I last saw you?

TRIS
My neighbor next door knew I didn't
know anyone here so he wanted to
introduce me to some of his
friends... and...somehow it turned
into a Chanukah thing. Come on in.

MILES
(following her in)
Alright, I'm into the dreidel.

INT. KITCHEN

Arthur and two of his friends, ERNIE and NORMAN, both around
80, sit around the table. The men all look sharp. Marta,
the Mexican Housekeeper makes latkes at the cooktop. Miles
and Iris ENTER, the boys quiet down.

TRIS

This is Miles...
MILES

Kendall.
IRIS

Miles Kendall. Arthur Abbott.

ARTHUR

was still alive.

MILES
Not true. I absolutely knew you
were alive, I just didn’t know you
lived in the neighborhood. It's a
privilege to meet you.

67.

He heartily shakes Arthur's hand. Arthur notices the way Iris

looks at Miles.

ARTHUR
You going to join us?

IRIS
Arthur, no... He's just here to
pick up a laptop.
MILES
Actually I'd love to. I= mean if
you have enough...
Iris opens her mouth but Arthur answers.

ARTHUR
We've got plenty. Sit next to Iris.

ARTHUR
What'd he sey? She had the
greatest ass?

IRIS
Greatest laugh!

 

NORMAN
Although her ass wasn't so bad
either.

Iris exchange a laugh.
ARTHUR

She had real gumption. She was the
girl I always wrote...

Iris is touched by that.

ERNIE
What about you Miles..,you're a man
about town, I presume.

MILES

No, gents, I sadly, am not.. I'm
just a one woman at a time kinda
guy. I've been dating a beautiful
actress for about eight months. I
don't know what she sees in me but
I know I'm the luckiest guy in the
world to know her.

Iris tries not to react. I mean, she hardly knows the guy

IRIS
Oh, she's an actress. What's she
been in? Anything I would've seen?

MILES
She hasn't done that much yet. She
was a girl in the cafeteria in Mean
Girls...a cigarette girl in The
Aviator...

NORMAN
And where is she tonight?

ARTHUR
Lock - he’s half dead and still
interested.
69.

NORMAN
He said, ‘cigarette girl'...I'm
curious. He's with us... Where is

she?
Again Arthur takes note of Iris' interest.

MILES
She's on location in New Mexico.
Working on a little indy film.
She'll be there for about 10 days.

ARTHUR
Well, her loss is our gain.
{looks at Iris looking at
Miles)
Fellas, I think we should leave
these young folks and get back to
our bedpans.

MILES
Norman, you're calling me for
pinochle...

NORMAN
I got your cell. I'11 be in touch.

INT. FOYER - A LITTLE LATER

Iris opens the door for Miles who holds Ethan's lap top and
some tin-foiled left overs.

MILES
Totally great night. You know,
Arthur Abbott is maybe the last of
the great Hollywood writers from
that generation. There are like
famous things we say...because he
wrote them.

IRIS
I knew. He told me his friends
wrote Casablanca but he added the
"kid" to “Here's looking at you,

kid."

MILES
Hello... Which totally makes the
line.

IRIS

Absolutely. "Here's looking at
you, Ilsa"...?

 
MILES
(laughs )
Not so memorable.

IRIS
He's so modest. He gave me this
long list of eld movies I had to
see...none written by him of
course. I saw a couple today. They
were fantastic.

MILES
Maybe we can see one together
sometime.

IRIS

That would be .great.
A warm wind from outside blows toward them.

MILES
Okay, s0...then, I'll call you.
(kisees her on the cheek)
The brisket was great....loved the
latkes... Great hangin‘ with you...
(kisses her on the cheek

again)
Sorry, didn't mean to kiss you
twice. .
IRIS

No problem.
Miles exits, facing more wind.

MILES
Crazy weather.

_ IRIS
I know.

Tris feels her cheek where Miles kissed her. she cLosps tu:

TRIS
Thank you Amanda.

HOT STEAMY WATER RUSHING OUT OF A TUB FAUCET

A HAND turns it off. We are IN IRIS’ TINY BATHROOM. NIGHT.
Amanda lies in Iris' tiny tub. It's so small, it's
impossible to stretch out in it. It's quiet. Then:

AMANDA
I'm not sure I can handle
complicated!?! God! I can be such
an ass-hole.

TRAILER GUY'S VOICE
Amanda Woods..!

AMANDA
Shut up!

TRAILER GUY'S VOICE
She pushed every guy away, every
time. It's not will she ever
change, but does she want to?

Big SPLASH as Amanda gets out of the tub.

EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

The Mini Cooper pulls into the gravel drive of this
beautiful, warmly lit house and parks. Amanda steps out,
wearing 4" heels and a chic coat. She reaches into the car
for a bottle of wine, a baguette, and some gourmet goodies.
She heads toward the front door, gathering her strength. She
notices smoke coming out of the chimney.

KNOCK KNOCK

Amanda stands at the door. No one answers. She rings the
bell, licks her lips, she’s a little nervous. She hears music
coming from inside. Then, suddenly, there he is.

GRAHAM

answers the door, shirt tail out, hair a bit messed.

AMANDA
Surprise!

GRAHAM
Yes. It is. Hi.

Graham eases the door closed so that nothing can be seen
72.

behind him.

AMANDA
Hi. So, I was heme doing nothing
and thinking of you and realized a
little complication never hurt
anyone and then I thought, maybe
this isn't complicated at all and I
thought how silly it was that we

were each in our houses -- alone --
five miles apart and also, I wanted
to apologize.... I really am sorry

for not inviting you in this
afternoon. I don't know what that
was about exactly...

(seeing him grow

increasingly

uncomfortable)
-- but whatever it was, I thought I
should get over it and try to...

(realizes)

You're... not alone are you?
GRAHAM
Uk, no I'm not actually. I'm
sorry.
AMANDA

No, don't be. I shouldn't've
just... Oh. Man.

(Graham looks pained)
Seriously. Do not worry about
this. Thie was just me being
stupid.

With that, the door OPENS UP A BIT and standing at Graham's
side is a precious FIVE YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL.

LITTLE GIRL
{in a loud whisper)
Who is it Daddy?

Amanda looks from the child to Graham.

AMANDA
{also in a loud whisper)
Daddy?
GRAHAM

Yes, I am Daddy. Amanda, this is
my daughter, Sophie. Sophis, this
is a friend of mine, Amanda.
73.

SOPHIE
How do you do?

AMANDA
I'm...fine, thank you. How are
you?

SOPHIE

Very well, thank you. Do you want
to come in?

With that the DOOR PUSHES OPEN EVEN MORE and an ADORABLE FOUR
YEAR OLD GIRL, holding a blanket stands next to her sister.

LITTLE ONE
Daddy, who is this?

GRAHAM
{lifts the little one into
his arms)
This is Amanda. Amanda, my
youngest, Clivia.

AMANDA
(putting it together)
Sophie and Clivia...

Olivia extends her little hand. Amanda, stunned, shakes it.

OLIVIA
Your hand is cold.
AMANDA
Sorry, I ama little cold.
SOPHIE
{nudges Graham)
Dad...
GRAHAM

Sorry. Yes. Of course. Come in,
INT. HOUSE

A big Christmas tree with lots of kids ornaments sits in the
large, warm Living Room. A family lives here. Amanda enters
a bit dazed by it all. Confused and starting to feel
horrified, she looks around for a wife.

OLIVIA
Can we still have hot chocolate,
please?
GRAHAM
Yes...
OLIVIA
With baby marshmallows?
GRAHAM
Yes.
SOPHIE
(whispers)

Dad, take her coat.

GRAHAM
Yes... May I?

AMANDA
Sure, thanks.
(whispers)
Are you married? Tell me fast.

GRAHAM
No...

Amanda takes off her coat to reveal a drop dead gorgeous, low-
cut, sexy dress. Olivia, Sophie and Graham just stare at
her. Olivia giggles.

AMANDA
I know I'm a tad overdressed.

SOPHIE
I ilove that dress. It's gorgeous.

OLIVIA
You look Like my Barbie!

AMANDA
Oh. Thanks.

OLIVIA
(noticing the wine and
goodies)
Is that for us?

AMANDA
Yes, but, sorry about the wine.

SOPHIE
He'll drink it, don't worry.

GRAHAM
Yes, the idiot will drink it.
 

75.

Sophie takes the wine and things from Amanda. The Girls dig
through the bag to see what she's brought.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
(whispering)
I apologize for not mentioning this
earlier...

AMANDA
You're...
(spells)
d-i-v-o-r-c-e-d?

Amanda sighs. The Girls turn around to see what caused that
reaction.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
Amanda, are you by any chance at
all into hot chocolate?

The Girls look to her. Is she?

AMANDA
As a matter of fact, I'm totally
into it.

INT. KITCHEN

The Three Girls sit at the table as Graham fixes muge of hot
chocolate, topping each mug off with tiny marshmallows. He's
very handy in the kitchen, very at ease. The girls artwork
hangs ail over the cabinets.

GRAHAM
(as he hands the little
one a cup)
Qlivia...it's hot, blow on it.

Olivia immediately starts to sip it.
GRAHAM/SOPHIE
(at the same time)
Blow on it!!

Amanda watches how great they are together. Graham then
hands a cup to Sophie.

GRAHAM
You too, Soph.
 

76.

SOPHIE
She has more marshmallows than me.

GRAHAM
No she doesn't, you each have five.

(hands a mug to Amanda)
You have five too.

Graham takes a seat.

AMANDA
If only I ate carbs.

SOPHIE
What's that?

AMANDA
Hmmm?

SOPHIE

Carbs? What does that mean?

AMANDA
Oh, it‘s all the stuff I never eat
because I don't want to get...
(realizes how stupid it
sounds}
+..you know what? Who cares? I'm
just gonna go for it.

Amanda takes a sip, slurps up a marshmallow and gets a
chocolate moustache. The Girls laugh.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
(realizing this)
What? Do I have something on my
lip?
{to Graham)
I don't, do I?

She takes another sip, purposely making it worse. The Girls
crack up. Graham smiles, appreciating her humoring the kids.
Amanda wipes her mouth as Olivia climbs onto Graham's lap and
as she climbs on him, she places her hand on Graham's face.

GRAHAM
(unable to see)
Comfortable?

OLIVIA
(wobbly holds her hot
chocolate)
Blow on mine...
77.

GRAHAM
Do you think there's a chance you
won't spill this on me?

With that Olivia tips her hot chocolate and some of it spills
on Graham's pants.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
Ahbhh..... Thank you, excelient
timing.
The Girls laugh.

AMANDA
Iwas a big spiller when I was a
little girl.

SOPHIE
She's the worst.

Olivia continues climbing on Graham.

GRAHAM

Because she can't sit still. ouch.
OLIVIA

You were like me?
AMANDA

I was. I thought I was the

biggest spiller ever.

OLIVIA
Do you spill now?

AMANDA
Sometimes. Because sometimes you
just can't help it. Right?

She wobbly brings her cup to her mouth. Everyone laughs.

OLIVIA
Dad, do Mr. Napkin Head.

GRAHAM
No, no, we do not do Mr. Napkin
Head for company.

OLIVIA
(bopping up and down on
Graham's lap)
Do it! Do it! Please?
78.

GRAHAM
Cuch. Girls, calm down.
SOPHIE /OLIVIA
Please!!!
GRAHAM

O-kay if you settle down, I'1l do
it. Quickly.

Olivia grabs him and kisses him.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
Thank you for that...

OLIVIA

You're welcome. Now do iti
GRAHAM

Amanda, may I have your napkin,

please?

Amanda hands Graham her cloth napkin and he places it over
his head, covering his face. He then takes his glasses out
of his pocket and places them on his eyes, but over the
napkin.

SOPHIE
(giggling)
Now smoke.

Graham picks up a spoon and holds it like a cigarette,
placing it in his mouth, but through the napkin and simulates
emoking. All the girls laugh. He scratches his head,
coughs, every bit gets screams from the kids. He pulls off
the napkin, a little humiliated. Everyone applauds.

OLIVIA
Do it again}

GRAKAM
Are you crazy? It's horrible
enough that I did it once.
Amanda laughs.

SOPHIE
Amanda, guess what? I have dress
up clothes in my room.

AMANDA
You do?
79.

OLIVIA
So do I. And we have a tent too.
Do you want to see our tent?

GRAHAM
Girls, we will not ask Amanda to
crawl in the tent.

OLIVIA
(looking hurt)
You don't like tents?

INT. THE GIRLS BEDROOM — UPSTAIRS

A large tent made out of blankets has been constructed
between the girls twin beds. Amanda, Graham and the Girls
stand in the doorway.

AMANDA
This is seriously cool.

INT. TENT

The Girls enter with ease. Then Graham enters, bent over,
then Amanda enters, barefoot.

SOPHIE
(rushing out)
Hold on...we need an extra pillow.

OLIVIA
Lie down.

AMANDA
Okay...

On the floor are blankets and pillows. Sophie enters with one
more pillow, hands it to Amanda. it's obvious the children
are enamoured with her.

SOPHIE
You can use my pillow.

AMANDA
Thank you.

OLIVIA
Lie down.

GRAHAM
Can you please stop being so bossy.

OLIVIA
Lie down please. Next to me.
BO.

The four of them LIE DOWN SIDE-BY-SIDE INSIDE THE TENT. The
grown ups lie together book-ended by the girls A small lamp
lights the inside of the tent, giving it an amber glow. on
the ceiling of the tent are stars and a moon cut out of
construction paper. Everyone lies there silently for a beat.
Sophie burps.

GRAHAM
Very nice.

SOHPHIE
(giggles)
Excuse me.

Everyone laughs.

AMANDA
(staring up)
This is an exceptionally great
tent.

GRAHAM
(also staring up)
Yeah, it's got something, doesn't
it?
SOPHIE
It's cozy.

AMANDA
Yeah... Whe cut out all the
beautiful stars?

SOPHIE
We did.

OLIVIA
The Three Musketeers.

Amanda reacts to that. Graham's hand rests next to Amanda's
He almost holds her hand but doesn’t.

OLIVIA (CONT'D)
Amanda. .?

AMANDA
Yes.

OLIVIA
You smell good.

AMANDA
Do I?
B81.

LIVIA
Yes. I love perfume but he won't
let me wear it.

GRAHAM
Because you already smell good.
(to Amanda)
So do you, by the way.

AMANDA
But I'm older so I guess I'm
allowed.

GRAHAM
Exactly.

OLIVIA
(turns on her stomach and
looks at Amanda, really
up close)
I like your eye shadow.

AMANDA
Thank you.

OLIVIA
And your lipstick.

AMANDA
Oh, thanks, it's new.

OLIVIA
What's it called?

AMANDA.
I think it's called Coral Shimmer.

Olivia places her finger on Amanda's mouth, touches it then
places her finger on her own mouth and rubs it on.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
(whispers)
Looks good on you.

Sophie checks her out... Olivia smiles.

OLIVIA
You know if you wanted to sleep
over, that would be okay...we could
push our beds together and it can
be really fun.
a2.

AMANDA
That's so sweet of you to invite me
but maybe ancther time...would that
be alright?

OLIVIA
{thinks about it)
Yes.

Olivia lies back down, touches Amanda's hand.

OLIVIA (CONT'D)
We never have grown ups here that
are girls.

SOPHIE
I know.

OLIVIA
I really like it.

SOPHIE
Me too.

No one says anything as they all continue looking up at the
construction paper stars.

INT. LIVING ROOM ~ GRAHAM'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
Amanda waits. Graham comes down the stairs.

GRAHAM
I can't imagine anyone making a
bigger hit with my children. They
want to play dress up with you, do
your hair, wear your shoes. They're
already imitating your léugh.

AMANDA
They're great...

GRAHAM
Thank you. Sophie has
unfortunately taken on the role as
my protector. She's brilliant but
I hate when she worries about me
and Olivia's gonna be a real ball
buster... which I must admit I love
about her.

AMANDA
I'm just trying to figure out why
you didn't tell me about them.
83

GRAHAM
(with difficulty)
Because I just don't ever... tell
women about them.

AMANDA
You think I should know your
parents make out walking the dogs
but not know you're a widower with
two kids?

GRAHAM
I was actually thinking of telling
you earlier today, when we were
having lunch.

AMANDA
And. .?

GRAHAM
Why didn't I? Right. Well, I don't
know. Something strange seems to
happen when women find out I'm a
widower with two little
girls...it's some kind of weird
aphrodisiac and it messes me
up...and with you, I really didn't
want to play the “poor me" card.

AMANDA
But it’s confusing since you're the
one who wanted to go out to lunch
to get to know each other...

GRAHAM
(painfully explains)

I have no defense except that until
I know someone really well, it's
easier for me to be just a normal
single guy because it's way too
complicated to be who I really
am... because I am, in fact,
anything Dut normal. I'm a full
time Dad, I'm a working parent, I'm
a mother and a father, I'ma guy
who reads parenting books and
cookbooks before I go to sleep. I
spend my weekends buying tutus...
I'm learning to sew. I'm on some
kind of constant overload... So, I
found it helps to compartmentalize
my life, just until I figure this
out. And so far, that's been
alright... not that I see thet many

(MORE)
BA.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
women, contrary to what you may
think. This past weekend the girls
were with their grandparents and
when they're gone, I get to pretend
I'm someone else. Someone without
hot chocolate spilled on their
trousers.... I don’t know how to
date and be this. And there is the
possibility that I'm petrified of
what another person will do to who
we are and how we get from one day
to the next. I feel I'm a guy who
can't make a mistake.

Amanda takes that in and wonders if she would qualify as a
mistake.

AMANDA
So I guess, given our weird thing,
I sort of get you not telling me.

GRAHAM
I didn't think I could introduce my
kids to someone I may never see
again.

AMANDA
Right. I'm just someone you had sex
with once and slept with twice.

GRAHAM
Actually I thought I was just
someone you had sex with once and
slept with twice.

Neither one knows who's right.

AMANDA
I think we just went way past
complicated.

GRAHAM
Well, like you said, I'm a book
editor from London...you're a movie

trailer maker from L.A. We're
worlds apart. I have a cow in the
backyard.

AMANDA

You have a cow?

GRAHAM
Yes. I sew and I have a cow. How's
that for hard to relate to?
85.

AMANDA
Pretty up there.

GRAHAM
Exactly. Which I believe may
disqualify me from winning bachelor
of the month.

They both wait for the other to say something to make this
better.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
Well, anyway....thank you for being
so sweet with the kids. I think it
was eye opening for all three of us
because they're absolutely right.
We never do have grown ups here
that ere girls.

AMANDA
I had fun....

GRAHAM

Good. Your visit may be the first

step in pulling my odd little life

together. So, really...thank you.
AMANDA

(not feeling so great)
Glad I could help.
EXT. HOUSE

Graham walks Amanda to her car. He's in his shirt sleeves,
she’s in her coat. Amanda turns to him:

AMANDA,
Graham...I'm glad I came over...

Graham hugs her, holds her close, but doesn't kiss her. The
moment is broken when from behind the house, they hear a Moo.

GRABRAM
Told ya...

They break apart, Amanda smiles, hesitates, then gets in the
car.

CLOSE on an UPSTAIRS WINDOW where Sophie watches Amanda drive
off.

INT. GRAHAM'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Graham picks up some toys, turns out lights.
86.

UPSTAIRS... He rounds the corner, picks up Olivia's little
socks and shoes then ENTERS HIS BEDROOM where Sophie lies in
his bed, under the covers.

SOPHIE
Amanda's not going to sleep over is
she?

GRAHAM

Probably not.

SOPHTE
I was wondering what she would make
us for breakfast. I bet it would
be good.

GRAHAM
Well, she's just here on vacation.
I don't think we'li get a chance to

find out.
SOPHIE

Toc bad. You know why?
GRAHAM

Why?
SOPHIE

I think she has potential.

GRAHAM
So do I.

INT. IRIS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Amanda, in her pajamas, dives into the cold bed. She lies
there, under the duvet, tries to cry. She tries really hard
Nothing comes. She gives it her all. Nothing. She checks
her watch, reaches for her cell, dials, waits, then...

AMANDA
~- Dr. Grinstein. Hi, it's Amanda.
I'm in England. I know I should've
called and told you I was leaving
but it was all very last minute. I
wanted to tell you, I met a guy.
He's maybe a great guy. He's a
widower and has two adorable little
girls. He's really “different” and
well, you know how I can be
sometimes. How it's hard for me to
“expose myself" as you say...well,
with him, I'm fighting that,
yet...I don’t seem to be doing any

(MORE )
87.
AMANDA (CONT'D)
better... Not that any of this
actually matters 'cause I mean I
can't be what he needs and we both
know that and anyway, we sort of
put the brakes on things tonight
but.... you know how I said I never
fall for "nice"... well, he's maybe
the nicest guy I ever met. He's so
nice, he's almost maternal. So
you're right...all men aren’t
schmucks. I had to come te another
continent to find that out...
Anyway, he's got his own stuff to
work out but I do like him... He's
very real and he's taking sewing
lessons! How sweet is that?
(beat)
Okay, well, hope you get this
message. You can try me back on my
cell. Thanks.

EXT. AMANDA'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

A bright beautiful day in Southern California. The Gardener
is clipping the roses. The front dcor opens and Iris exits.

I'll take it to him...

IRIS KNOCKS CN ARTHUR'S OPEN DOOR

IRIS (CONT'D)
Helloooo...

INT. ARTHUR'S HOUSE

Arthur is in his office, behind his desk, reading the Los
Angeles Times with a magnifying glass. Iris ENTERS, holding
his meil.

TRIS
Good morning.

ARTHUR

(drops the paper)
I counted. Nine movies are opening
today. I remember when nine movies
would open in a month. Half the
movies I wrote would never have had
a chance in today's world. Now a
picture has to make a killing in
the first weekend or they're dead.
This is supposed to be conducive to
great work? What if every book had
to be read in one weekend or every
painting had to be seen the day it
was hung in the museum? Who knew
movies would turn into a sporting
event?

TRIS
Have you always been this feisty?

ARTHUR
I may have slowed down a little,
but yes. You gotta fight the
fight, kid.

IRIS
{laughs}
Can I open a window in here? It's
very beautiful outside.

ARTHUR
I don't think the windows open in
here.
83.

Iris tries to open one. It's difficult, but she manages to
pry it open, then opens the next. She leans over Arthur's
Oscar...touches it when he's not looking.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I like that Miles by the way.

IRIS
Yes, he's very nice.

ARTHUR
He's got eyes for you...
IRIS

No he doesn't. He's got a gorgeous
girlfriend. As he told you.

ARTHUR
And the first night she's out of
town who does he go visit?

TRIS
{rolls her eyes)
He was picking up a laptop. Do you
want your mall?

ARTHUR
I'm just saying...a girl ona
mission such as yourself may want
to pay attention to a thing like
that.

IRIS
{looks at Arthur's mail)
Gas Company. Phone bill... You got
a letter from The Writer's Guild of
America West.

Arthur takes a look at the WGA Envelope and tosses it in the
trash.

ARTHUR
You watching the movies T
recommended?

TRIS
Yes. Love them. Irene Dunne is
fantastic.

ARTHUR
Gumption.
90

TRIS
Yes! Tons of it. Arthur, you
don't want to open that letter you
just threw out?

ARTHUR
No. They keep writing me about the
same thing.

IRIS
(teke it out of the trash)
But it looks important.

ARTEUR
It's not. They want to do some
kind of tribute to me, an evening
with me...I don't know, it sounds
God awful.

TRIS
What. do you inmean? That sounds
brilliant.

ARTHUR

Would you like to walk out onto a
stage on a walker, looking a
hundred years old and see eleven
shnooks who showed up to see you?
they can forget it. I mean, its
very nice...one little old lady in
the office probably just found out
I'm still alive and said,’Ew, let's
give him a night’. But no, I ain't
fallin' for this. Now, what's up?

ERIS
i wanted to know if you wanted to
take a little walk, but now I have
a better idea.

ARTHUR
What? We should go for a jog?

IRIS
Arthur, is anything wrong with you?
I mean physically wrong with you?

ARTEUR
No, I'm just plain old. Too old.

TRIS
So if you were in better shape,
you'd do this Writer's Guild night?
ARTHUR
Honey, at my age, you don't get in
better shape.

TRIS

(referring to letter)
May I?

(opens it, skims it)
"An Evening with Arthur Abbott."
Arthur, they want tc do this soon.
I bet with a little exercise, you
could walk out there on your own
and maybe I could go with you...as
your date or something.

ARTHUR
I would take you proudly, but
darling, I'm not going. Anyway,
how would you propose to get me in
shape? Seriously.
EXT. AMANDA'S POOL - DAY

Arthur and Iris are walking side by side in the pool. They
reach one side.

TRIS
Alright, we did it! Now back!

Iris turns and keeps walking as Arthur slips under the water.
INT. AMANDA'S HOME GYM - LATER

Arthur is on the recumbent bike. He's not peddling.

IRIS
Now go!
ARTHUR
{still not peddling)
IT eam.

INT. AMANDA'S KITCHEN ~ LATER

Iris and Arthur, in their sweats, are drinking orange juice.

When Arthur's not looking, Iris moves his walker to where he

can't reach it. thur finishes his juice and unbeknownst to
him, walks perfectly to his walker.

IRIS
Nice walking, kid.
INT. AMANDA'S BEDROOM — THAT NIGHT

Iris sits in front of the laptop. We hear the English
"You've Got Mail". Iris spots an e-mail from Jasper. She
hesitates, sits up straight, braces herself, then opens it.

JASPER'S E-MAIL
Who What Where When and me?

Iris isn't quite sure how to answer that. Fortunately, the

phone RINGS.
TRIS
(into phone)
Hello.

GRAHAM'S VOICE
So, are you ever coming home?

IRIS
Hi!

INT. TRAIN - MOVING - LONDON - NIGHT

Graham sits in a windew seat. on the train going back home
after a day's work. A stack of Christmas presents sit next

to him.

GRAHAM
How's it going? You having fun?

IRIS
I met e really nice guy.

GRAHAM
See. And you said you'd never...
What's he like?

IRIS
He's really cute, he's funny, very
smart, very successful, I feel good
when I'm with him which is an
entirely new experience and he's
about 85 years old.

GRAHAM
Come on...

TRIS
You know I can pick ‘em. He’s my
next door neighbor...or Amanda's
next door neighbor...by the way,
have you met Amanda yet?
93

GRAHAM
Uh, yes, I have actually.

TRIS
Oh, dear, can you hold? Call
waiting. Be right back. Hold on, I
really want to talk to you.

Iris pushes the FLASH button.
IRIS (CONT'D)
(into phone}
Hello.
EXT. SURREY MAIN STREET - NIGHT
Amanda, on her cell, takes Charlie for a walk.
AMANDA

{into phone)
Iris, hi, it's Amanda.

IRIS
Oh, hi, how are you? How's it
going?

AMANDA
It's going great. How's everything
with you?

TRIS

Oh, I'm loving it. Your house is
amazing and still in one piece I
might add. Oh, can you just hold
for a sec, my brother is on the
other line.

AMANDA
Graham?
IRIS
Yes, he said you met.
AMANDA
Yes we did meet. How is he?
IRIS
Fine I think... can you held for a
sec?
AMANDA

Sure.
IRIS
fpushes FLASH button and
TALKS TO GRAHAM}
Ai, sorry, that was Amanda.

GRAHAM
How did she sound? How's she
doing?
IRIS
She just asked me how you are.
GRAHAM
What did you say?
IRIS
I asked her to hold. Can I call
you back?
GRAHAM
I'il hold while you speak to her.
IRIS
Really?
GRAHAM
Find out how she is.
IRIS
Okay...
(pushes button, NOW TALKS
TO AMANDA)

My brother wants to know how you
are? How are you? Have you been
i211?

AMANDA
No, no, I'm fine. Can you tell him
I'm good...just taking Charlie for
awelk down main street. What's he
been up to, did he say?

IRIS
I'm not sure. Do you want me to
ask him?

AMANDA
Sure...

IRIS

Okay, hold please.
{pushes button, NOW BACK
TO GRAHAM)
(MORE)
95
IRIS (CONT'D)
I can't believe you had sex with
the woman staying in my house.

AMANDA
He told you thati!!

TRIS
Oh, God, no! I'm sorry! I thought I
was talking to Graham. Hold on
please. I'm terribly sorry.
(PUSHES FLASH BUTTON

HARDER)
I can't believe you had sex with
Amanda!!! She's been there four

days. The woman's on the rebound,
she's probably totally fragile, the
one thing she asked me was, ‘Are
there men in your town?" And I
assured her there weren't and you
meet her and immediately get in her
pants. Have you no sensitivity?

AMANDA
Still me.

IRIS
(dying) ;
Oh, bollocks. I guess I lost him.
Amanda I'm so....

(BEEP)
Can you hold a second, I'm so so
sorry.

(pushes FLASH)
Hello?

GRAHAM
Is she still on the other line?

IRIS
I can't believe you already had sex
with her? I'm so embarrassed.

GRAHAM
I can't believe she told you and
why are you embarrassed?

TRIS
No one had to tell me. It’s just
that you both asked how each other
were so many times that I can only
assume you've already had sex and
for some reason aren't speaking.

GRAHAM
Did she say we're not speaking?
96

TRIS
No, Graham...

GRAHAM
Good. No, I think we're just not
seeing as much of each other. How
much longer is she here or are you
there? When does she leave?

IRIS
Promise me you won't humiliate me.
Another 8 days I think. Be nice to
her, Graham. She sounds great.
She's got this amazingly beautiful
house...

GRAHAM
Really? Amazingly beautiful?

IRIS
Yes. With a media room, a gym, a
gorgeous pool, gates. Look, I
don't want to keep her waiting but
she wanted to know what you were up
to?

GRAHAM
(rising)
dust about to get off the train and
go home to the girls.

TRIS
Okay, I'll tell her. Everything
okay, otherwise? The girls are
good?

GRAHAM.
They're great. They miss you.
I'll call you soon, And say hi to
Amanda for me...or don't...whatever
you feel is better. No, say it.

TRIS
Oh God...

GRAHAM
Sorry. I happen to like
her...perplexing as that is for me.

IRIS
Then you should call her. Take it
from me ~- women don't understand

the net calling thing. We hate it
(MORE)
97

IRIS (CONT'D)
more than you'il ever know. More
than hate.

GRAHAM
Yes, but I don’t think she wants me
to call. I'm pretty sure she
doesn't.

IRIS
(BEEP )
Graham, I gotta go.

GRAHAM
What exactly is a media room?

IRIS
(rolls her eyes, BEEP)
I'm sorry. Are you still there?

AMANDA
(driving in the Mini with
Charlie next to her)
Yes...I'm in your car now...on my
way home.

TRIS
You drove into town?

AMANDA
(feeling dumb)
You don't?

IRIS

{covering)
No, I do...all the time. Yes.
Well, my brother's just getting off
the train from London, on his way
home to the kids..he wanted me to
make sure I said hello...and I'm
sorry about what I said before...I
obviously didn't realize I was
speaking to you. And I apologize
for my brother if he's done
anything stupid. He's a good guy
down deep...well not even down
deep...he's a good guy on every
level...he's a phenomenal
father...he's had a rough time
these last couple of years. Try to
forgive him if he's been a twit.

AMANDA
No, he's been great. I’m sure I've
been much more of a twit, actually.
98.

Amanda is now PASSING BY the Surrey TRAIN STATION and SEES
GRAHAM carrying the stack of presents and getting in his car,
Distracted, she slows down.

IRIS
Knowing him, I doubt that. So,
stay well, okay?

AMANDA
I will. Definitely. You too.

Amanda hangs up and watches Graham pull away from the
station.

BACK IN L.A.
The phone rings. Iris picks it up.

TRIS
Yes. Hello.

MILES' VOICE
It's Miles.

IRIS
Oh, Miles! Hi.

MILES’ VOICE
What are you up to?

IRIS
I was actually just going to
Blockbuster to get the next movie
on Arthur's list.

MILES' VOICE
You want some company?

Iris's eyes go to the e-mail before her -~-
Who What Where When and me?
IRIS
(into phone)
Love some,
INT, BLOCKBUSTER —- SAN VICENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT
Iris has put on a little more make up, some perfume, a snug

sweater. She walks the aisles looking at the videos. Miles
ENTERS carrying two Ice Elended Mochas from Coffee Bean.
MILES
T brought you the best drink in
town, didn't know if you liked
whipped cream so I told them just a
little squirt. You look great by
the way.

IRIS
Thanks.

MILES
Really great.

IRIS
Thanks. I'm feeling good. Been
working cut with Arthur.

Miles reacts.

IRIS (CONT'D)

What?

MILES
No, that must be...an awesome
workout.

{tries not to laugh)
I'm sorry. I'm trying not to
picture it.

IRIS
Okay, the workout's not that great
but the conversation is...please
stop laughing.... the conversation
is fantastic...

MILES
That, I totally believe.

As they make their way across the store, Miles pauses, picks

up the Body Heat video.

MILES (CONT'D)
You ever see this?

TRIS
I don't think so.

MILES
Great score by John Barry. Just
cozed sex...
(hums the score, moves on
te another video)
Love Batman...Very pure, very dark,
very Wagnerian.
(MORE)
100.

MILES (CONT'D)

(hums the score, moves

down the aisle)
Chariots of Fire...(hums it)...took
electronic, synthesized scores to a
whole new level. (moves on) One of
my top five favs... Chinatown.
Jerry Goldsmith...

(hums it intensely, then)

"Forget. it, Jake... it's
Chinatown.” Killer...
(moves on)

Driving Miss Daisy. Hans. Very
unexpected. Remember how great it
was?

He hums Driving Miss Daisy while he pretends to drive. Iris
laughs. He's insanely charming.

MILES (CONT'D)

Okay...

{picks up Forest Gump)
Great melody....

{hums Forrest Gump)
Sorta perfect.

(spots The Mission)
You gotta check this out sometime,
it's so genius, it like comes from
a whole other place.

(spots Pink Panther)
Okay, you can sing this one...it's
the most memorable movie theme
ever...and what's brilliant
is....it makes you laugh whenever
you hear it.

(gestures for her to sing)

IRIS
(shyly at first)
Da doo, da doo, da deo, da doo da
dao da doo da doasee00000
dddddadoo.

A Young Couple walks by and laughs.

MILES
See. Even gets a laugh in
Blockbuster.

Miles looks up and catches something OUT THE WINDOW.
HE SEES HIS GIRLFRIEND, MAGGIE

who is supposed to be in Santa Fe, walking arm in arm with a
very cute, Older Guy.
101.

MILES
What?!2

Iris leoks up and sees Maggie just as Miles takes off,
EXITING THE STORE. Iris stays and watches from inside.

Through the store window Iris sees Miles call Maggie's name
Maggie turns and dies at being caught. Miles walks to her.
Iris sees Maggie getting upset and starting to explain then
the new Boyfriend jcins her and starts doing the talking.
Miles looks at. Maggie hoping she'll stop the guy but she
doesn't,

INT. AMANDA'S LIVING ROOM - IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

Miles flops down on the sofa. Wiped.

MILES
Why do I always fall for the bad
girl?

IRIS

(handing him a CUP OF TEA)
You didn't know she was a bad girl.

MILES
I knew she wasn't good. Do you have
anything a little stronger?

Iris hands him a VODKA with her other hand.

MILES (CONT'D)
The question is -- Why am I
attracted to a girl I know isn't
good?

TRIS

Because you're hoping you're wrong
and every time she does something
that tells you she's no good you
ignore it and every time she comes
through and surprises you, she wins
you over and you lose that argument
with yourself that she's not for
you.

MILES
Exactly!
(Iris nods knowingly)
And on top of that, there's the old
standby...I can't believe a girl
like that would actually be with a
guy like me.
102

IRIS
I think a guy like you is a pretty
rare find.

MILES
I'm not, believe me. You know what
she said tonight? She said she
finished in Santa Fe after two days
and has been staying with whatever
his name was which means she's been
right here in town which means when
I spoke to her this morning on her
cell and she said, I'm looking out
my window and it's snowing, she was
in Santa Monica... What did she do?
Go to weather.com? That must've
made them both scream with
laughter. Meanwhile, I sent her
Christmas gift to Santa Fe
yesterday. Stood in line at Fed Ex
so she'd get it on time. She's a
cheat and a liar and...I'm stuck in
love with her.

Iris hands him the entire Vodka Bottle.

MILES (CONT'D)
T'm such a colossal loser. Look, I
don't want to ruin your Christmas,
yeu don't have to listen to this.
(finishes off his drink)

IRIS
Tt's okay. I Like the company.
MILES
Did you see me talking to her
tonight?
TRIS
I did.
MILES

You know, I didn't really give her
a chance to explain. Maybe she was
gonna tell me it was all a stupid

mistake. Maybe I went too nuts
and now she thinks she can't call
me.

IRIS

It didn't look like you went that
nuts.
163

MILES
It didn't? You think she knows she
can call me?

IRIS
I'm sure she does.

Miles takes out his cell, checks for messages.

IRIS (CONT'D)
What about some food? You hungry
at all?

MILES
You know, this isn't the first time
this has happened to me. Girls
have been dumping on me one way or
another my entire life which is
what made Maggie so extra sweet.
Thought I finally hit the jackpot.
You would never do a thing like
this to a guy, would you?

IRIS
Me? No, I...I wouldn't actually.
No.

MILES

of course not. You're like...ail
about being good. You radiate

"good".

IRIS
Which is apparently a really big
turn on.

MILES

It should be.

IRIS
Yeah....in Fantasyland. Look, I'm
gonna fix us some fetuccini. Does
that sound gocd?

Miles just sits there, dazed.
IRIS (CONT'D)
I know it's hard to believe people
when they say, I know how you feel,
but I actually know how you feel.

Miles lcoks up at her.
104

IRIS (CONT'D)
I was seeing someone back in
London. We work at the same paper,
then I found out he was also seeing
this other girl, Sarah, from the
circulation department on the 19th
floor. A person you'd never
suspect he'd even know or be
interested in. Turns out he wasn't
in love with me like I thought or
wanted to believe... seems I
actually had it all wrong...and
maybe he was her boyfriend all
along. Anyway, I understand
feeling as small and as
insignificant as humanly possible,
and how it can actually ache in
places you didn't know you had
inside you and no matter how many
new haircuts you get or gyms you
join or how many glasses of
Chardonnay you drink with your
girlfriends, you still go to bed,
going over every detail and wonder
what you did wrong or how you
could've gotten it so wrong, and
how in the hell, you covld think
you were that happy. And sometimes
you even convince yourself that
he'll see the light and show up at
your door, but after all that,
however long “all that"
is.....you'll go someplace new and
meet people that make you feel
worthwhile again...and all that
fuzzy stuff...those years of your
life...that will eventually begin
to fade.

A long beat.

MILES
Well fuck!
{hands her his Vodka)
You need this more than I do.

Iris drinks the vodka.
MILES (CONT'D)
That's what you're doing here?
You're getting sver somebody?

IRIS
Yes. This is me in good shape.
105.

MILES
Is this the guy who sent you pages
from his novel?

IRIS
(pouring another)
Yeah, that's him. He "needs" me...

MILES
80, he stays in touch...

IRIS
(drinking)
All the time.

MILES
So that makes it impossible to
forget him. Which is great for him
but sucks for you.

IRIS
See how great your life is compared
to mine?

She smiles bravely.

MILES
Okay. Let's go. I'm making you
some fetuccini. It's Christmas Eve
and we're going to celebrate being
young and being a-live.

IRIS
Miles, you really are an incredibly
decent man.

MILES
T know. Always been my problem.

CUr TO:

PASTA ON A PLATE

And Amanda is carrying it to the couch in IRIS' HOUSE, where
she snuggles under a blanket, in front of the fire, deep intc
a book. A small tinseled Christmas tree sits in the corner.

tea.

MILES
Okay, here it is... Arthur's theme
song. We give him a CD with this
tune and every time he hears it, it
gives him the confidence that he
can walk out there. Ready?

Miles plays the Indiana Jones Theme.
MILES (CONT'D)
Just kidding. Alright, here we
go...a little Arthur in the night.

And Miles plays a fantastic theme...nostalgic yet spirited.
107.

IRIS
It sounds like him.

MILES
(finishes it, then)
I also wrote one that sounds like
you.

IRIS
You did?

She sits next to him on the piano bench.

MILES
Iris...if you were a melody. I
used only the good notes...

Miles plays a tender, romantic melody. Iris is touched.

MILES (CONT'D)
(sings)
And Iris lives next door to....
(plays Arthur's theme)

Iris laughs, clearly falling for the guy.
INT. VILLAGE CAFE - SURREY - DAY

Amanda sits against a banquette reading the Herald Tribune
and drinking a cappuccino. She looks up and finds Olivia,
Graham's four year old, standing before her, red cheeked, in
her hat, coat and mittens. Amanda brightens at the sight of
her.

AMANDA
Olivia..! Hi.

-- Yeah, you too.

HOSTESS
(approaches Graham)
Table for three?

GRAHAM
Yes. Please.

HOSTESS
This one ckay?

She shows them to the table directly next to Amanda.

GRAHAM
sure.

They all laugh as Graham takes the banquette seat alongside
Amanda. The girls sit across from Graham in chairs. They
all sit awkwardly, given their proximity.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
(to Amanda)
How are you?

AMANDA
Would you like to...join me?

The Girls get excited.

GRAHAM
Sure. Thanks.

Amanda scoots over and Graham sits next to her. The Girls sit
across from them.
GRAHAM (CONT’D)
What should we have...what are you
having?

AMANDA
Just a cappaccino...

GRAHAM
Couldn't interest you in lunch?

AMANDA
Yes, you could...

GRAHAM
Great.

Graham shares his menu with Amanda. She looks at

The closeness of her is powerful. She

You ready?

GRAHAM
Yes. Um... Girls? Chicken stew?

SOPHIE

him, behind

110.

AMANDA
What?

SOPHIE
Nail polish like yours.

She shows Amanda her painted fingers.

GRAHAM
Very expensive gift...

The Girls tell Amanda all about their gifts. Graham and
Amanda listen as they Girls go on and on.

DISSOLVE TO:
LATER IN THE MEAL

Amanda is now doing the talking and the Girls are cracking
up. Olivia spills her drink. Amanda cleans it up without
missing a beat, still talking. Graham watches, then laughs
as Amanda finishes her story.

LATER STILL

Amanda is TAKING A PHOTO of the Girls with her phone. The
Girls get close together and smile. Then Sophie asks for the
phone and she makes Graham and Amanda get close together. We
SEE THROUGH THE PHONE and Graham and Amanda aren't even in
the photo. Graham raises the phone and suddenly they appear
and smile.

EXT. RIVERBANK — LATER

Amanda, Graham and the Girls watch a boat go down the river.
It's freezing. Graham opens his overcoat and pulls Sophie
inside. Amanda bends down and takes off her scarf and wraps
it around Olivia. Olivia hugs Amanda around the neck.

EXT. RIVERBANK ROAD

Graham places the girls in their car seats then walks to
Amanda who leans against the Mini.

GRAHAM
We're going to my parents for
dinner. Can I call you when I get
them in bed?

AMANDA

Graham kisses her on the cheek, gets behind the wheel and
drives off. Amanda waves to the Girls.
INT. IRIS' HOUSE — EARLY EVENING

Amanda is packing, Outside, it’s snowing. Charlie barks at
the window. Amanda packs a bit more then goes to the Living
Rcom, looks out the window, doesn't see anything. She opens
the front door and Graham is standing there. He grabs her
and kisses her.

AMANDA
Where are the girls?

GRAHAM
Sleeping at my parents.

Amanda rushes him with a kiss, he falls backwards. She grabs
him, takes him in the house and shuts the door on us.

INT. BEDROOM - A BIT LATER
Post coital. Lying side by side. Catching their breath.

GRAHAM
So you're totally great. Fuck!

AMANDA
Yeah, this is a bitch.

GRAHAM
Well, you must come to London all
the time for work, right?

AMANDA
London? Never.

GRAHAM
New York?

AMANDA

Not really. But that's easier. Do
you go there often?

GRAHAM
No. Rarely actually.
(then)
Long distance relationships can
work you know.

AMANDA
Really? I can't make one work when
I live in the same house with
someone.
112

GRAHAM
So, this could be a good solution
for you.

AMANDA

Graham, I can't see you leaving the
girls... L.A.'s halfway around the
world...every time you'd see me
you'll be gone for week. Can you
see yourself doing that very often?

GRAHAM
Not often... But you're your own
boss...you can travel.

AMANDA
I'm my own boss because I don't
really trust anyone else. If I'm
not there, I‘1l have no business.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
Okay, let's say we tried this.
We just commit to doing it. We
each go back and forth and we do
this for like six months.

GRAHAM
Yes. That's do-able.

AMANDA
And then let's say....we hit a
wall. Like... I can't constantly
get on a plane or the girls can't
deai with you leaving again. We
start to feel the tension and we
know this isn't going to work...so
we start fighting 'cause we don't
know what else to do... Then, after
a long, tearful...at your
end..-phone call...we say goodbye.
And it isn't like we're ever going
to bump into each other. So,
that'll be it. For real. It'll
be...over. Then what's left? Two
people feeling totally mashed up
and hurt.

A long awful moment.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
OY...
113

GRAHAM
Thank God.

AMANDA
~- Maybe we should realize that
what we've had these past few weeks
is perfect and maybe it won't get
any better than this...and maybe
you liking me is really only
because you know it can't work.
And maybe I can fantasize about how
perfect you are because I can't
ever really be with you...and maybe
Inaybe... Maybe we're trying to
figure this out because it makes us
feel good to feel this way...
‘Cause we both know, if you lived
in L.A., we'd take months to get to
this point so maybe the fact that
I'm leaving in eight hours makes
this far more exciting than it
might really be. Maybe.

GRAHAM
You're seriously the most
depressing girl I ever met. I have
another scenario for you.

AMANDA
Good.
{rubs her chest which is
beginning to hurt)

GRAHAM
I'm in love with you.

Did she hear him right?

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
I apologize for the blunt
delivery...but as problematical as
this fact may be... I am in love.
With you. And I'm not feeling this
because you're leaving. And not
because it makes me feel good to
feel this way, which, by the way it
does, or did, before you went off
like that. I can't figure out the
math of this thing, I just know I
love you. IJ can't believe how many
times I'm saying it...and I realize
I come with a package deal, three
for the price of one... and my
package perhaps in the light of

114.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
day, may not be so wonderful or one
anyone even wants a part of other
than me...but...1I know what I
want...which is in itself a miracle
and what I want is you.

(she turns to him, he
waits...)
And you speechless at this moment
is not exactly the reaction one
dreams of.

AMANDA
I wasn't expecting "I love you".
Hold on. I'm trying to find the
right thing to say.

GRAHAM
I think if the scbvious response
doesn't immediately come to you...
then...well...we can just... We
should just talk about something
else. Like possibly what a
complete ass I am.

Amanda's chest tightens and hurts.

GRAHAM (CONT'D)
As I recall, you did promise me you
wouldn't fall in love with me.

AMANDA
Sh-sh...

GRAHAM
I guess I just wasn't listening.

AMANDA
(moving toward him)
I never met a guy who talks as much
as me... you say so much more...but
could you just, for now...be quiet.
Please.

She kisses him deep and hard.
INT. SMALL JAPANESE RESTAURANT - L.A. - DAY

It's lunch time and this smail West side restaurant is
packed. Miles and Iris are eating at the Sushi Bar. They are
deep in conversation and their bedy language suggests they
have become close.

MILES
I don't know how I've never seen
The Lady Eve before...
IRIS
Stanwyck was dazzling. So sure of
herself.

MILES
And sexy.

TRIS

Really sexy. Every movie he’s told
me to watch has a powerhouse woman
in it.

MILES
You ever think maybe he's trying to
tell you something.

Miles cell phone rings.

IRIS
I didn't, but now that you mention
it...

Miles isn't listening anymore. He's staring at his cell.

IRIS (CONT'D)
~- What's the matter. Who is it?

MILES
{staring at the phone)
Maggie.

That stops Iris cold.

MILES (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Hello. Hi... I'm doing okay. You
don't sound so...

He covers his free ear, so he can hear. Iris tries not to
listen, but can't help it. Miles gets flushed as he listens
to Maggie's end of the conversation. Iris starts to sink.

MILES (CONT'D)
Maggie... I'm tied up for a bit...
(Iris is relieved then
Miles checks his watch)
Well, what time could you be there?
Alright, I'il meet you there as
sooh as I can.

He hangs up, looks at Iris, stunned. Iris waits.

MILES (CONT'D)
She misses me.
116.

IRIS
(ever the good girl)
Ses. She came to her senses.

Miles puts down his chopsticks, lost in thought.

IRIS (CONT'D)
We should get our check.

MILES
No, take your time. I can wait 'til
you're done. You love the spicy
tuna here...

Miles steals a glance at his watch, looks for the waitress.

IRIS
I'm fine. And if you need to go I
can get this.

Miles leans over, quickly kisses Iris on the lips.

MILES
You are the best.

IRIS
Ha.

Miles gets up, takes off. Iris sits alone, swallows hard.
Looks around, anyone watching?

MILES
(returns, talking)
No, that's not right. We're
eating. I'm not going to leave you
here alone.

He sits back down but so doesn't want toe be there.

IRIS
Miles, go.... I'll see you at the
Writer's Guild tonight. I mean, if
you can make it still.

MILES
I gotta get all the way to
Beachwood but I'm gonna try to be
there. Anyway, I'm bringing the
music. I mean, I want to be there.
I just don't know how long this is
gonna take. I'm sorry.

IRIS
It's all good. Don't worry.
117.

Miles rises, kisses her on the head, exits. Tris fumbles for
her wallet, drops a bunch of change, picks it all up, calls
for the Waitress. Sits alone.

CLOSE - JASPER'S PAGES
Iris picks them up and carries them up the stairs.
INT. BEDROOM

Iris falls onto the bed, looks outside, the trees are blowing
hard. She pushes the button to close the blinds and the room
falls into darkness. She turns on the night table lamp,
begins reading. The phone RINGS.

IRIS

(into phone, hopeful)
Hello.

(sits up)
Jasper? I'm just reading your
pages. I hadn't forgotten, I've
been busy, that's all. How are
you?

(laughs)
Gee you sound far away.

(he's getting to her}
That's not true... stop...I meant
to answer you. You sent me... What
kind of surprise? No, T don't
think I got it...

(a little confused)
Alright. I'11 look.

INT. FOYER
Iris rushes down the stairs, holding her cell.

TRIS

(into phone)
I don't see a box or anything.
Checking the kitchen now...

(ENTERS KITCHEN)
Not in here... Okay, hold on, I'm
gonna go check the gate. When did
you send it?

Iris OPENS THE FRONT DOOR and standing there, right before
her, is Jasper, in the flesh. He holds a small gift.

JASPER
I found your Christmas gift.
118

IRIS
{floored)
You've shown up at my door!

JASPER
Yes, I have.

Iris throws her arms around Jasper, hugging him almost too
hard. He kisses her. She holds back.

IRIS
Why are... What are you doing here?

JASPER
I was just going to ask you that.
How long have you been gone?

IRIS
Just two weeks.

JASPER
Feels like forever. Can I come in?

IRIS
Yes, of course. Oh my God.

JASPER
Some house...

IRIS
Really...what are you doing here?
I'm in shock.

JASPER
My publisher wanted me to "take
some meetings"...

IRIS
-- But you hate L.A..
JASPER
Not if you're here.
IRIS
{trying to digest this)
How's... Sarah?

Jasper shoots her a look. Almost a reprimand.

JASPER
She's fine.
TRIS
I never did get a chance to talk to
you about that...your engagement.
I was surprised you never mentioned
it.

JASPER
I didn't know myself until the day
before. Do we have to talk about
it right now?

IRIS
No...but...

JASPER
—_ What about something to drink?

INT. KITCHEN
Iris opens a bottle of wine.

JASPER (CONT'D)
This place suits you.

IRIS
(laughs)
Yeah, right.

JASPER
Really...you look different to me
here.

Iris deesn't answer.

JASPER (CONT'D)
Iris, look at me...
(she looks up at him)
I came here because I had to see
you. Had to.

IRIS
Jasper, I don't understand this. I
mean, I was right there..for three
years. Remember? Square
peg...round hole.

JASPER
What?

TRIS
That's what you said to me once.
That we weren't really right for
each other. We were a square peg
and a round hole...
120.

JASPER
I don't remember that. I just know
I didn't like when you were gone.
I also never checked my e-mail
more, it was driving me crazy that
I wasn't hearing from you.

She can't believe this. He sounds like her. He takes her in
his arms.

JASPER (CONT'D)
I don't want to lose you.

He kisses her.

TRIS
Lose me? This is too confusing...

JASPER
(pulls her to him)
I know. C'mere...

INT. MILES HOUSE - SAME TIME

Maggie paces, in tears. Miles listens. It's getting dark
outside.

MAGGIE:
I screwed up. Didn't you ever
screw up Miles? No, you probably
never have. I made a mistake. TIT
was stupid and impulsive...he was
older and...

Miles looks outside and sees the Olive Trees bending and
stretching in the wind. Miles BEGINS TO HEAR Iris' MELODY in
his head. It fills the soundtrack.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
-- I wish you'd just say something.
I mean, how many ways do I have to
say it? He wasn't what I thought
and I started thinking about you
and hoping you'd forgive me...

Miles looks at her. She stops right before him, looking very
beautiful and vulnerable and open.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Will you Miles? Will you forgive
me?

Iris' melody fades.
INT. IRIS' BEDROOM - ENGLAND - 3 A.M.

Graham is asleep. Amanda is awake...thinking about the day
they were lying in the snow, kissing and laughing. She turns
to Graham, his eyes open. She smiles faintly, apologetically.

INT. AMANDA'S LIVING ROOM ~ L.A. — SAME TIME

It's dark outside and only a small light is on in the room.
Iris and Jasper lie on the sofa, entwined. Iris gazes up at
him.

JASPER
This look in your eyes. This is
what I was always looking for.

IRIS
I've always looked at you like
this.

JASPER

No you haven't.

He kisses her and then slides his hand down her pants, under
her panties and over her backside.

JASPER (CONT'D)
Obhhh... I remember this ass.

He pulls her to him...by way of her ass. She blinks.

IRIS
Ummm...

JASPER
What's wrong?

TRIS
Can you remove your hand from my
bottom. ..please?
(He doesn't)
Please.
(he slips it out, she
untangles)
you know what?
(laughs at herself)
I never thought I'd say this,
literally ~ never - but I think you
were absolutely right about us.
(he looks confused)
Very square peg...Very round hole.

JASPER
You can‘t mean that.
122.

TRIS

The great thing is...

(breaks into a smile)
I actually do. And I'm about three
years late in telling you this but
nevertheless, some things need to
be said. Jasper -- you did not
treat me right. You broke my heart
and you acted like somehow it was
my fault...my misunderstanding... I
was too in love with you to ever be
mad at you so I just punished
myself... But, Chbhh, I remember
this ass somehow newly entitles me
to say -- It's over. This twisted
toxic thing between us is finally
finished. And you really can't
just waltz in here, on my great
Christmas holiday and tell me I'm
suddenly looking at you the way you
wanted me to. Like T have just
improved and qualified to be with
you. I'm miraculously done being
your Girl Friday. I got a life to
lead, buddy...and I don't think
you're in it... Now, I'm terribly
sorry, but I've got to be somewhere
really important and you've got to
get the hell out. And anyway, do
you think Sarah would appreciate us
doing this? She's a nice person.
She deserves better.

JASPER
Honey, you've changed.

IRIS
I know, I think what I've got is
something slightly resembling
gumption.

A TOWN CAR SITS IN ARTHUR'S DRIVEWAY

Iris, in a dress and heels, scoots around the Town Car and
knocks on Arthur's door. Without hesitation, the door opens.
Arthur is standing there, ready to go, speech in hand. He
wears his new suit, new glasses. He pauses when he sees how
lovely Iris Looks.

ARTHUR
Iris, you're a knock out.
123

IRIS
Thank you. And may I say, so are
you?

ARTHUR

Did I do my tie okay? I haven't
worn one in so long.

IRIS
(fixes it a little)
It's perfect.

ARTHUR
I like this Hugo Boss. He cuts a
nice suit. I got you something.

Arthur reaches inside and brings out a Box with a WRIST
CORSAGE in it. Iris can't believe it.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Forgive me, last time I had a date,
this is what we did.

IRIS
(slips it on)
It's beautiful.

ARTHUR
If it's too corny or if it's gonna
ruin your outfit...you don't have
to wear it.

IRIS
I like corny. I'm looking for
corny in my life.

ARTHUR
Nice line.

IRIS
It's all those movies...

ARTHUR
(smiles, then)
Ckay, let's do it. Let's get this
embarrassment over with.

INT. TOWN CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
Arthur and Iris sit side by side.
ARTHUR
Do not feel bad for me if only a

couple of dozen people are there.
(MORE )
124.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I‘m not exactly Quentin Tarantino.
I don't even think people
appreciate the old films anymore
for the writing. It's the directors
they remember. Plus it's the
holidays...people are away...

IRIS
Arthur, you gotta shut up.

The Car slows down.

IRIS (CONT'D)
This it?

ARTHUR
(to Driver)
Stay here. We'll be out real fast.
INT. WGA - LOBBY

Iris helps Arthur through the fairly empty Lobby. A Young
Film Student type approaches Arthur.

YOUNG MAN
Mr. Abbott?

ARTHUR
Yes, sir.

YOUNG MAN

We're all ready for you.

Two Attendants OPEN DOUBLE DOORS as Arthur takes Iris' arm
and they head:

INTO THE AUDITORIUM

As they ENTER, a packed room rises to it's feet. A few
hundred people, of all ages, applaud as Arthur walks the
center aisle toward the stage. Light bulbs flash. Arthur
tightens his grip on Iris. She places her hand on his.

He reaches the bottom of the stage. Another Attendant waits
to help him up a small set of stairs. The room quiets.
Arthur lets go of Iris. She smiles at him as his new escort
takes his arm.

Iris takes a seat in the front row, an empty seat next to
her. Then, out of the loudspeakers, we HEAR ARTHUR'S THEME
MUSIC. Upon hearing it, Arthur lets go of the Attendant's
arm and climbs the stairs alone to a rounding swell of
applause.
125.

Miles, a little out of breath, slips into the seat next to

Iris, wearing a coat and tie.

MILES
The man is a rock star.
IRTS
(stunned)
Hi...
ARTHUR

(fxom the podium)
Thank you. I'm absolutely
overwhelmed...

(then)

--that I could climb those stairs.

Laughter from the audience.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Thank you very much for coming

tonight. I am honored. I came to

Hollywood over sixty years ago and

immediately fell in love with

motion pictures. And it's a love
affair that's lasted a lifetime.

When I first arrived there were no
cineplexes or multiplexes. No such
thing as a blockbuster. I was here

B.c.. Before cable, before DVD,
before conglomerates owned the
studios, before pictures had
special effects teams and
definitely before box office
results were reported on the
nightly news. To make a good
picture, all we needed was a

girector, a producer, actors and a

writer with a story to tell. our

vocabulary was a simple one.
Emotion, dreams, tears and
laughter.

He's fantastic.

MILES
Iris.
IRIS
(turns to him)
Yes?
MILES

What are you doing New Year's Eve?

IRIS
I'll be back home New Year's Eve.

MILES
Do you know, I've never been to
England. Never been to Europe.

IRIS
No?

MILES
If I came over there, would you go
out with me New Year's Eve?

IRIS
{smiles at him)
I'd love to.

Yeturn their eyes to the stage, Miles neds to
Nice!

' HOUSE - ENGLAND - MORNING

A Mercedes waits for Amanda. She exits the house in her

shearling

coat, red scarf, just like she arrived. Graham

stands in the doorway.

AMANDA
Okay, we're not gonna make this a
bigger deal than it already is.

GRAHAM
No we're not.

AMANDA
It's not like we're never going to
speak or e-mail...or...

GRABAM
No set rules.

AMANDA
None. So, I'm just going to kiss
you, for the millionth time and
(MORE)
127.
AMANDA (CONT'D)
say.... be seeing you.
(she kisses him)
Be seeing you.

GRAHAM
{moves her hair out of her
eyes)
Take care of yourself.

Amanda walks to the car, waves, gets in and the car takes
off. Graham watches the car drive slowly away from the
cottage.

INT. CAR - MOVING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE

The Driver who dropped Amanda here two weeks ago is behind
the wheel.

DRIVER
Have a good holiday, Miss?
AMANDA
Yeah....great. Maybe the best

ever.

Suddenly very hot, Amanda pulls her scarf off. She looks out
the car window. Children pass by, laughing on a sled. Whoa.
She's really hot. She unbuttons her coat a little. Clears
her throat, checks her plane ticket, passport, phone. All
set. Then, she clicks opens her phone, looks at the Photo of
herself with Graham. Closes the phone. She rests her head
on the seat...doesn't feel quite right. What's going on?
She's a little out of breath. Without knowing, without
trying, with no effort whatsoever, her eyes begin to well up.
Amanda sits straight up, stunned. Is it going to happen?
Then, one small tiny little tear makes its way out of her eye
and rolls down her cheek.

TRAILER GUY'S VOICE
Amanda Woods! Welcome back!

Amanda screams. She tries to make herself cry, just to get
it all out. But all she can make is one more tear. She's
thrilled.

AMANDA
Turn around! ‘urn around and go
back! Pleasei!!

DRIVER
Forget something?

AMANDA
Yes!
128.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD
The car turns around and takes off back toward the cottage.
INT. CAR

Amanda is so excited, she's about to leap out of the moving
car.

AMANDA
Can you go any faster?

DRIVER
This little lane is always
tricky...gonna take a bit...

AMANDA
That's okay...

Amanda opens the car door, rushes out and runs, a happy,
expectant leok on her face. She gets to the cottage, opens
the little gate, rushes up the stairs, opens the door.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
Graham?

She doesn't see him at first.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
Graham?

Graham, back in the bedroom, steps into view. He wipes away
tears. Amanda says nothing. Graham waits.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
(from the Living Room)
Iwas just thinking. Why would I
leave before New Year's Eve? That
makes no sense at ail.

raham sighs quite loudly. Wipes his eyes on his shirt
sleeve.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
I mean you didn't exactly ask me
out but you did say you love me so
I'm thinking I've got a date...if
you'll have me.

GRAHAM
I've got the girls New Year's Eve.

AMANDA
Sounds perfect!
129.

Graham smiles and as Amanda rushes to him, we:

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GRAHAM'S HOUSE ~ ALL LIT UP - NIGHT - NEW YEAR'S EVE
INT. GRAHAM'S LIVING ROOM - MUSIC OVER

Olivia, in a party dress and carrying a noise maker, runs
through the room. She is followed by her Aunt Iris, also in
a party dress. Iris dances a bit as she carries two glasses
of champagne. She delivers one glass to Miles who is
sitting on the sofa, deep in conversation with Sophie. He
smiles when he sees Iris.

Amanda dances in with a tray of hors d'oeuvres. She stops in
front of Graham who twirls her. Amanda then dances over to
Iris who takes an hors d'oeuvre and the two women connect.
Amanda whispers something to Iris and Iris laughs. Graham
joins them and puts his arm around his sister. Iris rests
her head on his shoulder. Feels like the makings of a great
party. Camera pulls back and away, out the window and
eventually we Fade to Black.
