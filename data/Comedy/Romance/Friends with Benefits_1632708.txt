DYLAN
No. Not even close.

He almost steps on a dog sleeping on the floor, mouths "shit"
and accidentally knocks a cup of coffee onto his lap. He
mouths "shit" again.

JAMIE
The movie starts in ten minutes.

DYLAN
I know. I'll be there.
(whispers, to co-worker)
Give me your pants.

MALE CO-WORKER
What?

DYLAN
(whispers)
I need your pants. I'll buy you
lunch tomorrow.

MALE CO-WORKER
No.

DYLAN
I'm your boss, give me your pants.

JAMIE
Please don't be late. I don't want
to miss the beginning. The first
few seconds set the tone for the
whole movie.

The guy reluctantly takes off his pants. He's not wearing
any underwear. Dylan turns to another guy--

DYLAN
Give me your pants.

Dylan bursts out, zipping on his new pants.

DYLAN
I'm almost there.

JAMIE

Jamie walks up. The marquee reads "PRETTY WOMAN."

He speeds through the streets while talking--

DYLAN
So am I. Where are you? So many

JAMIE
I'm wearing the only clothes outside
the theater, 'cause I'm the only
person outside the theater.

DYLAN
I love that outfit. You look so
sexy in that.

Jamie checks out a shirtless jogger running by. She calls
out--

JAMIE
Looking good. Real fluid.

DYLAN (CONT'D)
I'm really sorry.

KAYLA

We missed "Your Body is a

generation's "99 Red Balloons!"
"Your Body is a Wonderland!"

DYLAN
Okay, only one song? That's not so

KAYLA
It was fucking "Your Body is a

She makes an "are-you-insane?" face.

I think we should take a break.

QUINCY
I just feel we should, you know,
chill for awhile.

PULL BACK to reveal Quincy's talking to Jamie with the Empire
State Building in the background.

JAMIE
Really? You're doing this? You
said I was your "soul mate."

QUINCY
I did? When?

JAMIE
When we were having sex at that bed
and breakfast.

QUINCY
Oh, well. That doesn't...

JAMIE
Doesn't what?

QUINCY
(quietly)
Count.

She shoves him and slaps the sandwich out of his hand.

KAYLA
Please don't take this personally.
It's not you at all.

Reveal Kayla is talking to Dylan outside the Capitol Records
building--

DYLAN
Of course it's me. You can't say
that. Break up with me, fine, but
don't say it's not me. You're
breaking up with me. It's me.

JAMIE
Is this why you were late? You were
worried about how to break up with
me?

QUINCY
No, I was late because I couldn't
figure out what to wear.

JAMIE
So you went with a hoodie and
sneakers. Are you going to take the
SATs after this?

QUINCY
Don't lash out. You're better than
that.

JAMIE

I'm really not.

Back to Dylan in Los Angeles-- (Over the following we keep
cutting back and forth to tight shots of Dylan and Jamie.
Kayla and Quincy are always dirty shots.)

KAYLA
I just think we're heading in
different directions.

Yeah, you to the John Mayer concert,

until after the concert, by the way.
Seriously, best breakup ever. *

JAMIE
Let me ask you a question, and please
know I am not at all crushed by this
breakup, so be honest. Why?

QUINCY
Really? Is this a trick?

JAMIE
No, just some anthropological
research.

QUINCY
Okay. Uh, you're a little closed-
off. You're looking for someone to
sweep you off your feet, but you're
more into the idea of that someone
sweeping you off your feet than that
actual someone. Also? You seem all
together, but you're really
emotionally damaged--

JAMIE
Okay, that's enough.

DYLAN
I was tied up at work, I'm sorry.

KAYLA
You know you might care a little
less about work and a little more
about the girl you're dating.
Last I checked "work" can't reassure
you that liking a finger up your ass
doesn't make you gay.

DYLAN
I didn't say go up, I said go--
(makes an "O" with
his fingers)
It's fine. Not your issue any more.

KAYLA
Sorry. I think you're a good guy.
A little too emotionally unavailable

Dylan walks with a friend through all the lame-fake super

DYLAN
I think I sabotage these things. I

she might be the last girl I'll ever

Why do relationships always start

It's like taking something awesome

He points to a theater with the marquee: "FERRIS BUELLER:

three actors dressed in various costumes--

She leans over him to look out the window, making sure she
brushes him as she does.

"My kidneys are failing, let me keep

DYLAN
Why do women think the only way to
get a guy to do what they want is to
manipulate him?

JAMIE
History, personal experience, romantic
comedies.

You're here for a reason. Whether
you want to admit it or not.

She leads him down the sidewalk. They land in the middle of
the area in front of the TKTS steps. People swarm around
them.

Now you're showing me large groups
of people. Because no one ever
congregates in LA. All we do is
drive and stay with our own races.

Just then a fast cover of "New York New York" starts blasting.
The camera finds a few people holding up synchronized
boomboxes. Then a few pedestrians start dancing
(choreographed) to it, then some people join in, then some
more-- it's a flashmob. Shot from all angles, it's stunning.

DYLAN
Do these people get paid for this?

JAMIE
Nah, it's just for fun. Feels nice
to be part of a group. New York can
be a lonely place sometimes.

DYLAN
And you're trying to sell me on it?

JAMIE
Every place is lonely sometimes.

Just then one of the dancers leapfrogs Dylan, scaring the
shit out of him. Dancers are now all around them. They try
to make their way out of the flashmob, ducking dancers legs,

Wait. I can leave? Then what's the

They're a lot of loopholes, just
sign the damn thing.

DYLAN
(as he signs)
Wish T-Mobile had loopholes.

JAMIE
Thank you.

DYLAN
I was thinking of getting some lunch.
You eaten yet?

JAMIE
Are you asking me out? That's really
inappropriate.

DYLAN
I'm not asking you out. I'm asking
you to show me a restaurant.

JAMIE
"Cause I'm the only friend you have
in New York. It wouldn't be smart
to complicate that.

DYLAN
Jamie, I'm not asking you out.

JAMIE
I mean sure, we might have fun for a
little while, roll around, maybe
even get into some erotic humiliation
fantasy, but it would just end badly
and we'd hate each other.

DYLAN
I'm not fucking asking you out, Jamie!

JAMIE

Okay, fine.
You don't like me like that. You
don't have to hurt my feelings.

They eat at a table.

JAMIE
Was it an easy move?

Dylan's cell rings over--
DYLAN
It was hard leaving my dad and my
sister gave me some shit, but the
timing was right.

He sees it's Kayla. He hits "Ignore."

DYLAN (CONT'D)
The timing was really right.

JAMIE
Your sister?

DYLAN
No. My ex. She wants us to "stay
friends."

JAMIE

(puke noise)

DYLAN
Also she's convinced she can cure me
of my emotional unavailability.

JAMIE
Oh, you're emotionally unavailable?
I'm emotionally damaged. I haven't
seen you at the meetings.

I'm kinda burnt on relationships for

Dylan's phone rings again. It's Kayla. Jamie picks it up.

Hello. You've reached Dylan Harper's

It's Dylan.

SHOTS of the party. Dylan fits in perfectly. Laughing,
drinking, playing PlayStation "Move," dancing, people making
out, more drinking, etc. Dylan passed out drunk, Jamie and
friends draw all over his face with a Sharpie.

MONTAGE:

INT. DYLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Dylan works in his office moving around a new layout on a

bulletin board.

The faded remnants of Jamie's drawing-on-

his face are still visible.

INT. DYLAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Different party. Jamie passed out drunk. Dylan draws on
Jamie, but nothing appears on her face. He gives up.

INT. JAMIE'S OFFICE - DAY

She's giving a presentation to some executives. Her materials
read "OLIVE BRIDGE EXECUTIVE RECRUITMENT." She turns off

the light and we see her face has been drawn on with glow-in-
the-dark marker.

INT. DYLAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

He works late at night with colleagues. Tommy Bollinger is
swinging a baseball bat as he thinks. Then he absentmindedly
starts to stroke it. Dylan takes it away from him.

INT. JFK BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY

Jamie waits to pick up a recruit. She's finishing a slice
of pizza. Then she spots an electronic billboard featuring
the Times Square flashmob ending in "GQ.Com!" She takes a
picture of herself pointing to it and emails it to Dylan.

INT. DYLAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Dylan works in his apartment, eating a gyro alone. He hasn't
unpacked anything yet. He gets the picture and writes back:
"Nice. Can't do dinner. Working like mofo. Tell everyone

hi."

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE CLUB - DUSK

Dylan is hosting a party for GQ at the Brooklyn Bridge bar.
The women with the see-through tops have "GQ.COM" printed on

me here my first day in New York.

Well she's awesome. 'Cause check

He points to a guy with a huge package.

TOMMY BOLLINGER (CONT'D)
I'm gonna shotgun that shit tonight.

DYLAN
Do you have sex every day?

TOMMY BOLLINGER
Do you have sex every day? No. Do
you want to have sex every day?
Yes. Why? Because you're a guy.
Let me tell you something about gay
guys. We're guys. And guys like to
fuck. It's not emotional. Not about
feelings. Just busting a nut.
Understand?

DYLAN
(not really)
Mostly.
TOMMY BOLLINGER
I love what you're doing with the
cover layout. Classy yet current.

He high-fives him and heads off. Dylan turns and accidentally
bumps into Alex Rodriguez, knocking a drink on him.

ALEX RODRIGUEZ

Alex goes ballistic and has to be restrained.

END MONTAGE
INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT 50

Now it's only Dylan and Jamie. They're drinking beer,
watching another movie. ON SCREEN a romantic comedy actor
talks to a romantic comedy actress in any location. "Plucky"
score accompanies their every move:

ROMANTIC COMEDY ACTRESS
I can't do this anymore.

ROMANTIC COMEDY ACTOR
Yeah. We have to both get happy.

The actress turns and walks away with tears in her eyes.
The actor stays, checks his watch and heads off for something
clearly important. The score reflects this.

DYLAN
Why do these movies always have such
bad music? And it's wall-to-wall.
FWB - BLUE Draft 7-14-10 36

JAMIE
It's so you know how to feel every
single second.

DYLAN
"I'm heartbroken!"
(sad beats)
"I'm getting married to the man of
my dreams!"
(happy beats)
"I'm creeping through an office!"
(suspenseful beats)

Jamie laughs as she gets up. As she crosses off, Dylan
"scores" her every move: every footstep, head turn, etc.

She exits and Dylan "scores" anticipatory beats. He changes
the score as she (playing along) pops her head in then holds
up a bag of popcorn and walks back.

JAMIE
Is that my husband?

Dylan "scores" suspense. Jamie continues acting--

JAMIE
I don't care! You're the one I want.

She sexily approaches him on the couch. He "scores" sexy

music. She leans in to him and breaks off at the last second.

They laugh. She collapses on the couch.

JAMIE
I wish my life was a movie sometimes.
I'd never have to worry about my
hair, or pay my bills, or have to go
to the bathroom. And then when I'm
at my lowest point, some guy would
chase me down, pour out his heart
and then we'd kiss.

ON SCREEN: INT/EXT. UNION STATION - DAY

An actress buys a ticket from the kiosk, suitcase in hand.
She's wearing a broach in the shape of a daisy. An actor
runs up with a bouquet of daisies.

the couple exit the station and get into a horse-

drawn carriage and go off into the sunset in a big crane

shot.

That's awesome.

DYLAN
I didn't know New York had so many
palm trees.

JAMIE
Don't be a hater.

Why don't they ever make a movie
about what happens after the big
kiss?

DYLAN
They do. It's called porn.

JAMIE
God, I miss sex.

JAMIE
No one wants to go away for the
weekend after they play tennis.

DYLAN
It's just a game. You shake hands
and get on with your shit.

She finishes her beer and gets up. Dylan watches her walk
out of the room, noticing for the first time she's wearing a
T-shirt without a bra. She returns with two bottles of beer.

DYLAN
Let's play tennis.

JAMIE
I suck at tennis. And it's kinda
gay.

DYLAN

No I mean, let's "play tennis."

JAMIE
What?

DYLAN
Let's have sex like it's tennis.

JAMIE
Get the hell outta here.

She shoves him as she collapses on the couch.

DYLAN
Why not? This could be great.

She hands him a beer.

JAMIE
Dude, we talked about this. I don't
like you like that.

DYLAN
I don't like you like that either.
That's why it's perfect. Two people
playing tennis. Cracking our necks.

JAMIE
I don't even know if I think you're
attractive.

DYLAN

That's cute.

Not here. In the bedroom.

DYLAN

JAMIE
Light's better in the bedroom. And
‘cause you're just my friend, I don't
have to be insecure about my body.

DYLAN
You're beautiful. You have nothing
to be insecure about.

supportive. Lock that down.

Dylan is in the bullpen with some people, including Tommy
Bollinger. He compares two covers: one with Barack Obama,
the other with the other with Alex Rodriguez.

DYLAN
Let's go with Obama.

TOMMY BOLLINGER
No! Too easy. Go with A-Rod. He's
philanthropic, transcendent of sport,

Yeah. Of course.

ANNIE
So when are we seeing Jamie again?

I don't know.

What's your problem? Did you have a

Annie, for the last time, we're not

ANNIE
Come on, Dylan.

DYLAN
I don't know. But it's not Jamie.

Jamie's taking it all in.

ANNIE
Why, 'cause you're great together?
"Cause you're actually friends with
each other? 'Cause you're the
happiest I've ever seen you?

DYLAN
Yes, those reasons. I don't know
what to tell you, Annie. She's not
for me. I don't like her like that.

ANNIE
But you liked her enough to have sex
with her?
FWB - BLUE Draft 7-14-10 108

DYLAN
It was just physical. Like playing
tennis.

ANNIE

If it was just physical, it would've
been a one time thing and then you
would've never talked to each other
again. Trust me.

DYLAN
The fact that we kept having sex is
proof that it didn't mean anything.

Annie smacks him in the head.
ANNIE

I don't think I've seen you this dumb

DYLAN
It's a lightning bolt! With extra

ANNIE
You can't name one thing wrong with
Jamie.

DYLAN
I could never go out with her.

She's too fucked up. She doesn't
want a boyfriend she wants someone
to solve all her problems.

ANNIE
Sometimes the right person can solve
all your problems.

DYLAN
Well I can't. Not with her. She's
too damaged. Magnum PI couldn't

Dylan, Mr. Harper, and Tommy Bollinger (in a tuxedo) speed
across the Hudson river towards Manhattan.

Mr. Harper is in the bow with a big smile on his face.

DYLAN
I owe you big time, Tommy.

TOMMY BOLLINGER
No worries, man. I was heading into
the city anyway. Tonight's the
Butterfly Ball. Best place to pick
up dudes. It's like flames to a
moth.

DYLAN
You okay, Dad?

MR. HARPER
Are you kidding? I'm great.

He's never been happier. Dylan dials a number on his cell.
DYLAN

Hey, it's Dylan Harper from GQ. I
need a huge favor...

130A EXT. NEW YORK STREET (NEAR TS)- LATER - DAY 130A*
Dylan and Mr. Harper walk. Dylan makes a call. *
DYLAN
Hi, this is Dylan Harper. We met *
once with... right. Can I ask you *
a favor?
Mr. Harper turns off and accidentally knocks into someone. *

It's Alex Rodriguez.

ALEX RODRIGUEZ *
Pardon me, sir. My fault. I must *
have been in your way. Are you okay?
MR. HARPER *
Yes, thank you. *
(recognizing him) *
I'm a big fan of the way you play *
the game, Mr. Jeter.
ALEX RODRIGUEZ *
Actually, I'm Alex Rodriguez. Derek's *
my teammate. *
MR. HARPER *
Oh. I'm sorry. *
ALEX RODRIGUEZ *
It's okay. We look alike. Especially *
in pinstripes. Can I help you find *
where you're going? *
Dylan hasn't been paying attention because he's been on the *
phone. He notices his dad isn't next to him and quickly
turns back... and bumps into Alex Rodriguez.
ALEX RODRIGUEZ (CONT'D)
You! Are you kidding me? If I wasn't *
in public right now I'd rip your *
face off and feed it to your ass.
DYLAN *
What's your problem with me? *
ALEX RODRIGUEZ *
Well first off, you dress weird and *
a little gay but you get away with *
it somehow which really pisses me *
off. But most important, I saw you *
with Jamie. How could such an awesome *

girl be with--

(re: Dylan)
this over--
(re: himself)
this.

DYLAN
I'll tell her you say hello.

Big moment for Dylan. A-Rod lunges at him and Dylan hides
behind his dad.

INT. DYLAN'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT - NIGHT
Dylan's dad is settling in on the couch in front of the TV.

DYLAN
You sure you're going to be okay?

MR. HARPER
I'll be fine.

DYLAN
My number's right here. There's
food in the fridge. Here's the
remote.
Mr. Harper picks up a copy of the latest GQ.
MR. HARPER
How do you wear white pants to a
cookout?
He turns to the article as Dylan watches.

MR. HARPER (CONT'D)
Go. Say hi to her for me.

Dylan nods and leaves.
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - LATER - NIGHT
Jamie walks through the crowd of people on the phone.
JAMIE
Where are you? I'm in the middle by
the clock.
INTERCUT WITH: INT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

Lorna is on the couch on the phone.

LORNA
I'm right by the guy in the tie.

JAMIE
What? There're a million guys in
ties.

LORNA
So look for the guy I'm standing
next to.

JAMIE
Mom! You're always late. It drives
me crazy!

LORNA
Just hang on.

JAMIE
You never do what you say you're
going to do. When am I going to
learn?

LORNA
Baby, come on--

133*

Just then Kriss Kross's "Jump" starts to blast from the PA
system. Jamie looks around and watches as... a flashmob
breaks out. All the people in the station start jumping up

and down in place. Jamie looks around confused.
Lorna hears this over the phone and smiles.

LORNA (CONT'D)
You know, I don't think I'm gonna be
able to meet you after all. Something
came up.

JAMIE
What?

LORNA
Yeah. But let's meet tomorrow.
I'll be on the balcony.

Jamie looks up at the balcony. And there stands...

JAMIE
Oh my god.

LORNA
Have a great night, honey.

Dylan.

Lorna hangs up. And in walks in a tall, great-looking black
man. He sidles up to Lorna and gives her a kiss.

LORNA
And my daughter said you were a lamp
post.

They start making out as we go back to Grand Central. Jamie
watches as the flashmob transitions into Semisonic's "Closing
Time."

He makes his way down the stairs and dances with a section
of the mob. Jamie tries hard not too laugh, but he's too
irresistibly cute. She can't help but smile. They yell
over the music and the distance--

JAMIE
What is this?

DYLAN

"Closing Time" by Semisonic. It's
Super awesome. And the song I used

to sing when I went--

 

JAMIE
Not the song. This.

DYLAN

You wanted your life to be like a
movie. Sorry I had to do it in the
real Grand Central Station and not a
fake one.

They watch the entire lobby dance. It's amazing.

JAMIE
My mom was in on this?

DYLAN
Under MILF in my phone, remember?

(then)
I'm really sorry, Jamie. Not just

because you heard what I said to
Annie, but that I said it at all.

JAMIE
I'm having trouble hearing you.

DYLAN

Yeah, I didn't really think this
through. I guess in the movies the
guy pours his heart out and then
they put in the music later.

JAMIE
What?

 

Dylan makes his way to Jamie, avoiding the dancers as he
does. He takes Jamie up the stairs where it's a little

quieter.

DYLAN
I never felt about a girl the way I
felt about you. And I was scared
that if we got together something
would mess that up. Like what
happened with my dad and mom. So I
did what I do best: I ran.

JAMIE
When did you start feeling this way?
When we started having sex?

DYLAN
Way before. When we became friends.
I can live without ever having sex
with you again if I had to, but I
can not live without my best friend.
Trust me, I wouldn't be easy, but...
Jamie, I want my best friend back.

Jamie starts to tear up.

DYLAN (CONT'D)
Everything that happens during the
day, all I can think is "I can't
wait to tell Jamie about this."
When I see someone curse all I can
picture is you blinking. And when I
hear a little kid has been cured of
cancer, I pray it wasn't by that
douchebag doctor who ran out on you.

JAMIE
That last one was a little weird.

DYLAN
I know. I mean, I'm glad they're
cured, curing cancer's awesome, I
just wish someone else did it. I
miss you.

JAMIE
It wasn't bullshit by the way. I am
damaged.

FWB - BLUE Draft 7-14-10 136

DYLAN
We both are. That's what makes us
so awesome. And our tattoos.

JAMIE
And I do want someone to solve all
my problems.

DYLAN
Here I am.

Dylan gets down on one knee.

JAMIE
What are you doing? Get up.
DYLAN
Jamie, will you be my best friend
again?
JAMIE

(laughs, through tears
That was super queer.

DYLAN
Oh, I know.

JAMIE
Under one condition.

DYLAN
Anything.

JAMIE
You kiss me.

He gets up.
DYLAN

Whoa. That's what got us into this
mess in the first place.

JAMIE
No. Starting at sex is what got us
into this. I want to start with a
kiss.

DYLAN
I can do that.

He kisses her. She kisses back. The best, most romantic,
most passionate kiss they've ever had. The music ends.

DYLAN (CONT'D)
You can all go home now!

The flashmob immediately dissipates. There's an eerie silence
to Grand Central Station. Dylan wraps his arms around Jamie
as they head to the doors.

JAMIE
What do we do now?

DYLAN
Have our first date.

JAMIE
Cool.
(then)
I have a ten date rule you know.

DYLAN
It's ten now? Wow.

JAMIE
I've been burned before.
(then)
Maybe seven. I'll give you time off
for good behavior.

DYLAN
So if we go out four times a week
for three weeks, we should be good
in... twenty-seven years? That's
not right.

JAMIE
No, it's not.

She grabs his hand and they go down the staircase, with Dylan
"scoring" their every step. Jamie is smitten and plays along
with some stops and starts, Dylan "scoring" the whole way,
which segues into real score as they head outside.

EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - SAME - NIGHT

They emerge and come across a horse-and-carriage.

JAMIE
Aw, Dylan.

She starts to get in. Dylan holds her back.

DYLAN
Um, that's not for you.

JAMIE
Thank god. Horses actually scare
the shit out of me.

A tourist couple get in the carriage and it rides off. They
head across the street to the restaurant.

DYLAN
So, where are you from?

JAMIE
Outside of Philadelphia.

DYLAN
Interesting.

They enter the restaurant. WE STAY outside and watch through
the window as they start their first date. The ENTIRE CREDITS
ROLL as they sit across from each other and ad-lib their

first date, talking, laughing, and getting to know each other --
even better. After four minutes of credits, we FADE OUT

then we FADE IN to see them having sex on the table in the
middle of the restaurant.
