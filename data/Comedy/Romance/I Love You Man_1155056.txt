I LOVE YOU, MAN

John Hamburg

(Based on the screenplay "Let's Make Friends by Larry Levin)

September 26, 2007
FADE IN:

EXT. EMPTY LOT - NEAR DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DUSK

The lights of downtown L.A. twinkle in the distance. PETER
KLAVEN, late 20s-early 30s, nice looking, approachable,
stands in front of a fenced in lot with his attractive
girlfriend, ZOOEY RICE, same age, a little artsier-looking.

PETER
So, my plan is to build a cluster
of live-work lofts around the
perimeter here, and then create
this really neighborhoody retail
and dining area in the central
square here. I even thought maybe
you and Hailey and Denise could
open up another location of your
store.

ZOOEY
Really? Denise keeps talking about
wanting to open another branch.

PETER
It'd be great. The land is a
little pricey, so, I won’t be able
to develop it right away, but, when
I sell the Ferrigno Estate, I
figured out, I’1ll at least be able
to put a down payment on it, and
still have enough money left over
for the reception in Santa Barbara.

ZOOEY
Peter, what are you talking about?
What reception?

Beat. Peter pulls a small JEWELRY BOX from his blazer. A
look of realization washes over Zooey’s face.

PETER
I know it’s only been eight months,
but, I am madly, insanely,
ridiculously in love with you.
He opens the box, revealing a lovely DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.

PETER (CONT'D)
Will you marry me?

Off her look of complete, utter happiness...
INT. PETER’S CAR - NIGHT

Peter drives. Zooey is in the passenger seat, glowing. She
speaks over the car’s BLUETOOTH SPEAKERPHONE with one of her
two best friends, HAILEY.

ZOOEY
...it just happened like two
minutes ago. Hailey, can you
believe it?!

HAILEY (0.S.)
How have I been on like ten million
dates and you end up marrying some
totally awesome guy who randomly
walks into our store?!

ZOOEY
(quietly, to Peter)
Doesn’t realize she’s on speaker...
(into car microphone)
Will you conference in Denise?

HAILEY (0.S.)
Hold on.

Zooey grabs Peter’s hand as she waits...

ZOOEY
That piece of land is perfect.

PETER
I’m so excited you like it. The
neighborhood is like, two years
away from taking off, but--

DENISE, Zooey’s other best friend, comes on the line.

DENISE (0.S.)
I cannot fucking believe you didn’t
call me first.

ZOOEY
You are such a freak! Hailey’s
before you in my speed dial!

DENISE (0.S.)
I’m kidding. Zooey, oh my god! I
am so psyched for you it is
disgusting. Hold on, Barry goes
crazy if I’m in the house during
his poker night.

(MORE )
DENISE (0.S.) (CONT'D)

(to her husband)
Give me a second you fat douchebag.
Zooey just got engaged. Peter.
You’ve met him twenty times, dum-
dum.

(into phone)
Sorry, Zo. So, did you guys pick a
date?

ZOOEY
June 30th in Santa Barbara. Peter
already booked that place Bacara
where we went for that long
weekend.

HAILEY (0.S.)
Oh, he is so sweet. Wait, is
Bacara the one where you guys slept
together for the first time?

DENISE (0.S.)
No, wasn’t that in the hot tub in
Mexico?

HAILEY (0.S.)
That’s right. It was Mexico.

PETER
You told them about the hot tub?

ZOOEY
Maybe. I don’t remember.

HAILEY (0.S.)
Wow, so June 30th?

ZOOEY
I mean, it’s soon, but--

DENISE (0.S.)
Who cares? Peter’s a doll, and he
goes down on you six nights a week.
What the hell are you waiting for?

Peter looks at Zooey in disbelief.

ZOOEY
You’re right. It’s gonna be great.
I gotta go. I’11 call you later.
Love you.

HAILEY (0.S.) DENISE (0.S.)
Love you! So fucking psyched for you!
PETER
How do they know so much about our
sex life?

ZOOEY
Hailey and Denise are my best
friends in the world. Girls share
stuff like that.

As Peter considers this...

ZOOEY (CONT'D)
Ah! We're engaged! I’m so
excited!

She kisses him passionately, as we go to...

EXT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Hand in hand, Zooey and Peter walk towards their cozy

bungalow in the Silverlake section of L.A.. Zooey’s on her
cell-phone.
ZOOEY
..--I know, he’s the best. I feel
so lucky.

(quietly, to Peter)
It’s Debbie. She’s freaking out.
(back to phone)
Alright, I gotta call Lisa, call me
later, okay? Love you, bye.

They enter the house.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s decorated in a minimalist way with cool, eclectic
furniture and knickknacks. Zooey is on the phone with
another friend.

ZOOEY
.--love you too, Lisa. Talk to you
tomorrow.

She hangs up. Turns to Peter.
ZOOEY (CONT'D)

I’m sorry, sweetie, I’m totally
hogging the phone.
PETER
No, that’s fine. I just want to
give my parents a call.

THE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Peter speaks with his mom, JOYCE, on speakerphone.

PETER
.--Mom, what do you think she
said?! She said yes!

JOYCE (0.S.)
Oh, honey, I’m so thrilled for you.
And you did it in front of that

piece of land like we talked about?

PETER
Yes, she loved it. Thanks, that
was such a good idea.

ZOOEY
I didn’t know that was her idea.
Thank you, Joyce!

In the b.g., the sound of MEN EXULTING.

PETER
Dad sounds really excited. You
told him?

JOYCE (0.S.)

Actually, he and Robbie are
watching some kind of boxing
program.

Peter’s father, OSWALD “OZ” KLAVEN shouts out...

OZ (0.S.)
Ultimate Fighting!

PETER
Do they want to get on the phone?

JOYCE (0.S.)
I’m sure. Hold on, honey.

(after a moment)
Apparently, they’re in the middle
of the game, sweetheart. But they
say congratulations.
PETER
Oh, okay. No prob. Alright, well,
we'll talk to you tomorrow.

ZOOEY
Bye, Joyce!
JOYCE (0.S.)
Kids... I’m thrilled. Goodnight.
She hangs up.
ZOOEY

Was that weird that your dad and
brother didn’t want to pick up?

PETER
No, I’m sure they’1l call back.
Wow, I am exhausted. Getting
engaged is intense. You want to go
up to bed?

ZOOEY
It’s only nine. You don’t want to
call any of your friends?

PETER
Nah, I’1l make some calls tomorrow.

ZOOEY
Really? You don’t want to call
that guy Tevin? Don’t you speak
like twenty times a day?

PETER
Yeah, but, he’s more like a co-
worker than a friend.

ZOOEY
Or Gil, from your fencing club?

PETER
He’s not really a ‘Call right away
to tell him the news’ kind of
friend.

ZOOEY
So, who do you consider your
closest friends?
PETER
Uh, you know there’s a bunch of
guys. Samir Patel, my freshman
roommate from UCLA.

ZOOEY
I’ve never heard you mention him.

PETER
No? One Beer Samir? We’re pretty
tight. You’re right, I should give
him a ring.

THE LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Peter’s on the phone. Zooey putters around in the b.g.,
pretending not to be paying attention.

PETER
Hey, Samir? It’s Peter... Peter
Klaven. Yeah, man, I guess it’s
been a little while. You been
good? Great, well, I just wanted
you to know that I got engaged
tonight, so, we’re getting married
in three months and... Samir, no, I
didn’t bail on your wedding, I
just, I couldn’t make it. I
thought I sent a gift though... no?
Oh, well... I’m sorry, man. I
didn’t know you were so... okay,
right, you take care as well.

He hangs up. Looks at Zooey.

ZOOEY
When’s the last time you spoke to
him?

PETER

I guess it was a couple years ago.

ZOOEY
Why didn’t you go to his wedding?

PETER
I wanted to, but, I promised
Lindsay I'd go to her family
reunion that weekend.

ZOOEY
And he’s your closest friend?
PETER
He’s... no, I have a bunch of good
friends. I have the guys from my
fencing club. There’s Bob Loden.

ZOOEY
Your chiropractor?

PETER

He’s a great guy. Honestly, I
think Samir has a drinking problem.
He must've forgotten how close we
were.

(off her skeptical look)
Don’t look at me like that. I have
friends. Just ‘cause they don’t
call me every two seconds like
Hailey and Denise, doesn’t mean
they don’t exist.

EXT. PETER’S PARENTS’ (THE KLAVEN’S) HOUSE - NIGHT

Peter and Zooey stand at the front door. JOYCE KLAVEN,
hugs Peter. Then Zooey. Ad libs her congratulations.

PETER
Where’s Dad?

JOYCE
In the den. Robbie gave him this
Nintendo Wee or Wah, who knows
what, for Father’s Day. They’re
obsessed.
(shouting)
Boys, Peter and Zooey are here!

0Z (0.S.)

Out in a minute! I’m about to kick
your son’s ass in Tiger Woods!

INT. THE KLAVEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

50s,

Peter and Zooey sit around the dining room table with Joyce,
Peter’s soft-spoken but macho, guy’s-guy father, OZ, as well

as his cute, gay younger brother, ROBBIE.
JOYCE
...did Peter have any good friends
growing up?

She looks to Oz, who shakes his head.
JOYCE (CONT'D)
I honestly don’t seem to remember
any.

PETER
Zooey, just to clarify here, Dad
worked for IBM. We moved every
eighteen months.

OZ
Robbie always managed to have
friends. I mean, he probably
wanted to suck their dicks, but--

JOYCE
Oswald!

ROBBIE
Mom, he’s actually kind of got a
point.

JOYCE
Well, he still doesn’t need to use
that language. The point is,
Zooey, Peter always connected with
women.

ZOOEY
I can see that. He’s a great
boyfriend.

OZ
Also, you need to remember that he
matured sexually at a very young
age. I remember taking him
swimming when he was twelve, the
kid had a bush like a forty year
old Serbian.

PETER
Dad, please stop speaking.

JOYCE
No, but, you always had a
girlfriend, as far back as I can
remember.

OZ
He wasn’t a guy’s guy. Your
brother here is into video games,
fishing, we golf together...
10.

PETER
What are you talking about? I play
sports.

OZ

You prance around in tights with a
sword. It’s not a sport.

ROBBIE
Oh, snap!

PETER
I’m a competitive fencer. It’s in
the Olympic Games!

ZOOEY
Oz, you two didn’t do father-son
stuff together when Peter was a
kid?

OZ
Almost never. He spent all his
time hanging out with his mother or
circling real estate listings.

PETER
I was nurturing an interest that
became my career.

OZ
A woman's career.

PETER
There’s plenty of male real estate
agents.

OZ
It’s just something of a faggoty
job, that’s all.

PETER
“Faggoty?!” You can’t use that
word!

OZ
Yes, I can. Robbie gave me
permission.

ROBBIE

Dad loves the gays. I made him an
honorary homo last week.
11.

PETER
Guys, this is ridiculous. Why is
it weird that I had girlfriends?

OZ
We're just saying you never had a
best friend. That’s all.

PETER
Who’s your best friend?

OZ
I have two. Hank Mardukas has been
my closest friend in the world
since our first year at IBM, he was
Best Man at my wedding, we speak
three times a week for the past
thirty years. And then, there’s
Robbie.

PETER
Robbie is your other best friend?

OZ
Correct. And Hank Mardukas.

ROBBIE
Zooey, here’s the deal. Peter’s a
girlfriend guy. Okay? Girlfriend
guy’s never have good male friends
because they put all their energy
into their girlfriends so their
male friendships fall by the
wayside.

PETER
Zooey, don’t listen to him. Robbie
barely knows me.

ROBBIE
Peter, I happen to be an expert on
men, and I know it’s true. We are
who we are.

OZ

Well put, son. We are who we are.
Look, you think I was happy when
Robbie told us he was a flamer? Of
course not, but, I got used to the
idea that he craved a wiener in his
caboose after about five minutes,
and the truth is he’s cool as hell.
12.

ROBBIE
Dad, I actually prefer to be the
top.

OZ

I know you do, pal, I’m speaking
metaphorically here.

JOYCE
Alright, that’s enough. Come on,
let’s clear the table.

Peter stands up to help his mom.

OZ
See?

PETER
I can’t help Mom with the dishes?

OZ
Do you see Robbie and me lifting a
finger?
(points to him and Robbie)
Guy’s guys.

Peter looks very unhappy.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
The newly engaged couple get ready for bed.
PETER

You know what? I completely
forgot. I do have a best friend.

ZOOEY
Who’s that, sweetie?
PETER
You.
ZOOEY
Peter, I’m your girlfriend--
PETER
Fiance.
ZOOEY

Fiance, whatever. I don’t want to
be your best friend.
(MORE )
13.

ZOOEY (CONT'D)
Don’t get me wrong... I love you.
It’s just different.

PETER
You don’t feel like you can be open
and honest with me? I thought we
talk about everything.

ZOOEY
We talk about almost everything.
There’s just certain things I talk
about with Hailey and Denise that I
could never... it’s just different,
that’s all.

PETER
Well, I guess I don’t have any
close male friends. So, do you not
want to marry me anymore?

ZOOEY
Of course not. I really don’t
care. I just want you to be happy,
that’s all.

PETER
I’m very happy. It’s not like this
is something I’ve been missing.

Peter takes a ZANTAC from a bottle on his night-table
Swallows it with some water.

ZOOEY
What’s wrong? Your acid reflux?

PETER
A little bit. It’s fine.

They get into bed.

ZOOEY
I’m just thinking, for the
ceremony, I want a bunch of
Bridesmaids up there, plus my Maid
of Honor...

PETER
Right...

ZOOEY
But if I have six girls standing
with me, and you don’t have anyone,
it might seem a bit uneven, no?
(MORE )
14.

ZOOEY (CONT'D)
Are you thinking Robbie might be
your Best Man?

PETER
Robbie? No. Like I said, we’re
really not close.

ZOOEY
You know what, don’t worry about
it. We'll figure something out.
(then)
Oooh, it’s my turn to host Ladies
Night tomorrow.

PETER
No prob. I have fencing practice.
I‘ll go for a drink with the guys
afterwards.
(realizing)
I’m telling you, those dudes are my
friends.

ZOOEY
I know, baby.

They start kissing. Things are heating up, when... the phone
rings. Zooey turns on her bedside light, picks up the phone,
eyeing the Caller I.D..
ZOOEY (CONT'D)

It’s Hailey. She had a blind date.

I‘ll be two seconds. I just want

to make sure she’s okay.
INT./EXT. PETER’S CAR - MORNING

As Peter drives to work, through the car windows, he takes in
a world of MALE FRIENDSHIP he never noticed before.

-He sees a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS laughing.
-FOUR SUIT-WEARING GUYS gabbing away as they carpool.
-Two JOCKS jogging together.

-A BILLBOARD with two SWEATY BUDDIES, post-workout chugging
an ENERGY DRINK.

-A cluster of OLD RUSSIAN MEN playing CHESS and KIBITZING at
an outdoor café.

EXT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY - ESTABLISHING
15.

INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY

A typical real estate office. Filled primarily with WOMEN.

IN THE KITCHEN AREA
Peter fixes a coffee as he speaks to a few FEMALE CO-WORKERS.

PETER
...she was completely surprised.
It was really, even more amazing
than I thought it would be.

FEMALE CO-WORKER #1
Oh, Peter, that’s so romantic.

FEMALE CO-WORKER #2
Just.. congratulations. So happy
for you.

FEMALE CO-WORKER #3
Ooh, I’m so jealous. You’re gonna
be the best husband!

MAIN OFFICE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

As Peter heads towards his desk, he passes the cubicle of a
handsome, cheesy guy named TEVIN DOWNEY -- perma-tan, blonde
streaks in his hair. He is cracking up from something on his
computer when he looks up.

PETER
What’s so funny?

TEVIN
One of the guys in my fantasy
football league sent me a Quicktime
of a grandma riding a Sybian
machine.

PETER
I don’t know what that is?

TEVIN
It’s a vibrating saddle that women
sit on to give them super-intense
orgasms. Check this out.

Peter looks at the monitor. And winces.
16.

TEVIN (CONT'D)
How sick is that?

PETER
Very. That is very sick.

TEVIN
So, what up, Dog? How’s the
Ferrigno dealio coming?

PETER
Coming good. Getting ready for the
Open House in a couple weeks.

TEVIN
It’s a big piece of house, so, if
you want a co-pilot on this one,
let me know, okay? Be happy to
team up, help you “Git R Done.”

PETER
What does that mean, “Git R Done?”
TEVIN
Larry the Cable Guy? The hilarious
comedian?
PETER

Oh, yeah, I don’t really know his
stuff. Anyway, I think I got it
under control, but thanks for the
offer.

Tevin goes back to his computer. Peter takes a final glance

at the sick image on the screen, walks away.

INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Two MEN, dressed in fencing gear, expertly parry with each

other. They finish, remove their masks, revealing that one

of them is Peter. They salute each other, as fencers do.

INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

A post-shower Peter and some other FENCERS get dressed.
FENCER #1

Nice job stealing my tempo there,
Peter.
17.

PETER
I set you up for a solid attack on
the blade, but you parried back
pretty well.

FENCER #2
Anybody seen my Manchette?

FENCER #1
Under your Plastron, dickweed.

They jostle with each other -- the way men do in a locker
room. Another fencer, GIL, talks to Peter.

GIL
I told my cousin the open house is
a week from Saturday, right?

PETER
Yeah, it’s gonna be great. I
appreciate you hooking me up with
him, Gil. It’s a really big deal
for me.

GIL
You sold me my house, right?
You're the most honest real estate
agent I know.

PETER
Thanks. And look, I know you’re
the middle-man here, but, if your
cousin has any questions, he should
feel free to call me.

GIL
I will let him know.

PETER
Great. So, you guys want to get
some grub? Or, grab a beer or
something?

The fencers exchange uncomfortable looks.

FENCER #1
We're actually, uh, we’re driving
up to Joshua Tree tonight.

PETER
Oh, yeah? What’s going on up
there?
18.

GIL
(jostles Fencer #1)
We're taking Eugene on a little
bachelor party slash camping trip.

PETER
I didn’t know you’re getting
married.

FENCER #1 (EUGENE)
I am, indeed. Next Sunday.

PETER
Great. Cool deal. You doing kind
of a small thing, or--

EUGENE
Um, it’s like three... twenty five.
I managed to rope these boys into
being my groomsmen.

PETER
Very, very cool.

Awkward beat. Then...

EUGENE
I would've invited you, but, you
never really come out with us after
practice. I didn’t think you--

PETER
Dude, don’t sweat it. Seriously,
no worries. It’s funny, I just got
engaged myself.

EUGENE
That’s great, Peter. Your fiance
designs book jackets, right?

PETER
No, that was Heather, she was a
couple of girlfriends ago. Zooey
owns a home furnishing store in
Silverlake.

EUGENE
Awesome, man. Good luck with that.

GIL
Alright, we have a long drive. We
should hit the road. Later, Peter.
19.

PETER
Have fun, boys.

Peter waves, watches them exit -- joking with each other. He
sits there alone in the locker room, sadly packing up.

EXT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Peter is about to enter through the front door. Through the
window, he sees Zooey and her GIRLFRIENDS sitting around the
living room, drinking wine, laughing.

He heads to the back of the house.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - BACK DOOR - NIGHT

Peter quietly lets himself in.

INT. PETER’S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

Peter is on his computer. ON THE SCREEN -- he works on the
online listing for a spectacular, MODERN HOUSE in the
Hollywood Hills. He fiddles with the layout and description.
The sound of female laughter is audible O.S..

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Peter prepares a tray of ROOT BEER FLOATS for the ladies. As
he does, he looks out the kitchen window, sees his MALE
NEIGHBOR in his house across the way -- watching a BASKETBALL
GAME with his FRIENDS. They all react as Kobe dunks.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zooey hangs out with a circle of LADIES, including HAILEY,
single and miserable about it, and DENISE, caustic and
married.

LADY #1
He didn’t make any friends at UCLA?

ZOOEY
He lived alone after freshman year.

LADY #2
Ooh. The ones who lived alone
we're always the biggest
freakazoids.
20.

ZOOEY
Peter’s not a freakazoid. He had a
serious girlfriend all through
college.

DENISE
Look, we’re not saying he’s a
freakazoid, but the truth is, for
the future of your marriage, it’s a
little troubling. If Barry didn’t
have any friends I’d shoot myself
in the face.

The ladies laugh. BY THE DOOR TO THE KITCHEN, Peter is about
to interrupt when he just stops... and LISTENS.

DENISE (CONT'D)
I’m serious. You know what my
favorite nights are? Hanging out
with you guys. And I can do it
guilt free because Barry loves
hanging out with his friends too.
Every month there’s a golf weekend,
a ski-trip, a weekend in Vegas.

LADY #1
You let him go to Vegas? Aren’t
you worried he’s cheating on you?

DENISE

He’s forty pounds overweight with a
Jew-fro and a small dick.

(off their looks/laughter)
I love the guy to death, but I’m
far and away the best looking woman
he’s gonna get, and I’m just a
seven.

ALL THE LADIES
Come on! You are so not a seven!
You’re hot!

DENISE
I know, I totally think I’m higher
than a seven! I was testing you
bitches!

HAILEY
So, who’s going to be his Best Man?

ZOOEY
I have no idea. I really think his
Mom might be his closest friend.
21.

The ladies react to/shudder at the thought of this.

LADY #2
This is a serious issue, Zo. Guys
without friends can be super-
clingy.

LADY #3
My dad had no friends. It was
awful. He dragged my mom to all
these football games. She hated
it. That’s a big reason why they
got divorced.

ZOOEY
Look, the truth is, I’m freaking
out, you guys! I know, I’m
horrible for feeling this, but, I
can’t believe I’m marrying someone
who has no friends!

Peter motions to turn back around when he makes a noise.

ZOOEY (CONT'D)
Peter?

Peter opens the swinging door between the kitchen and the
rest of the house... holding the tray of root beer floats.

PETER
Oh, hey, I just made you guys some
Root Beer Floats.

The ladies greet Peter, ad lib -- thanking him,
congratulating him on the engagement. Then...

ZOOEY
I thought you were going out with
your fencing team?

PETER
Yeah, they couldn’t make it, so, I
just came back here. Don’t worry,
I’ve been in my office working.
I’m not even here. Bye, ladies.

He sets down the floats. Starts to exit.
ZOOEY
Thanks for the floats, baby. That

was really sweet.

He waves, disappears.
22.

ZOOEY (CONT'D)
Holy shit! You think he heard us?

DENISE
Definitely not.

The ladies all shake their heads, trying to convince
themselves.

INT. PETER’S HOME OFFICE —- CONTINUOUS

He stares out the window, watching his neighbor say goodbye
to his friends -- giving half-hugs, cool handshakes, etc.

EXT. EQUINOX GYM - WEST HOLLYWOOD - DAY

Buff MEN and WOMEN enter and exit this sleek gym.

INT. EQUINOX GYM - CONTINUOUS

Robbie Klaven wears a tight fitting tee-shirt that reads:
TRAINER. He walks with a concerned looking Peter.

ROBBIE
You need to find a Best Man for
your wedding?! What are you, ina
John Hughes movie?

PETER
I know, it sounds ridiculous, but,
Zooey is really upset about this
friend thing. You said at dinner
you know all about men. I don’t
know where else to turn.

ROBBIE
This is so exciting, you coming to
me for help. The good news is, not
only do I know about men, but
straight guys are my specialty.

PETER
What does that mean?

ROBBIE
I get bored pursuing gay guys.
When you’re cute and fit, you can
pretty much have any fag you want.
(MORE )
23.

ROBBIE (CONT'D)
I like to set my sights on straight
guys to give myself more of a
challenge.

PETER
Does it work?

ROBBIE
Peter, I get more butt-pussy from
straight guys than you could ever
imagine.

PETER
Just... please don’t ever use that
term with me again.

Robbie walks up to a bench press where a GUY is struggling
with a bar-bell. Robbie adopts more of a straight-guy voice.

ROBBIE
Come on! Push it out! It’s all
you! I’m not even helping! Little
further! There you go!
The guy looks up at Robbie appreciatively.

BENCH PRESS GUY
Thanks, man.

ROBBIE
No worries. I’11 see you around.

BENCH PRESS GUY
I hope so.

Robbie and the guy exchange smiles.

PETER
That guy was totally flirting with
you.

ROBBIE

I know, and did you see the wedding
ring? Straight as an arrow. I’m
telling you, hooking up is easy.
Meeting platonic male friends, not
so much.

PETER
Why is that?
24.

ROBBIE
Several reasons. First off, at
your age, most men are settled into
their groups of friends. Either
they have friends from high school,
college, or work. As time goes on,
the straight ones get married,
spend time with their wives and
kids, even their old male
friendships tend to fall off. The
single guys could care less about
finding new male friends unless
it’s a wing-man who can help them
pick up girls. So, you’ve set
yourself a high bar. It can be
done, but, ‘tain’t gonna be easy.

PETER
Alright, so, what do I do?

ROBBIE
We have to put the word out on the
street that you’re available. I’11
do some recon around the gym, but
you need to be aggressive about
this. Every man is a potential
suitor. You see a guy on the
street, strike up a conversation.
Ask him on a man-date. By that, I
mean a casual lunch or after-work
drink. No dinner and no movies.
You’re not taking these guys to see
THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, understand?

PETER
Yes. Keep it casual.

ROBBIE
Men are very sensitive about
meeting new friends. Why? Because
they’re all secretly afraid that
they’re gay, and half of them are.
So, they overcompensate by being
emotionally distant and guarded.

An incredibly STRAIGHT-SEEMING GUY walks by, exchanges
“Hey’s” with Robbie.

PETER
Let me guess, you slept with that
guy?
25.

ROBBIE
No, but he gave me a handjob in the
steam room last week. It was
terrible, ‘cause his fingers were
all calloused from weightlifting.

PETER
See, this is why we don’t hang out.
You're disgusting.

Robbie shrugs, unfazed.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Peter and Zooey sit on the living room couch watching the
last scene of BRIDGET JONES’S DIARY.

PETER
How is it that Renee Zellwegger is
from Texas? Her accent is
incredible.

ZOOEY
I know, it’s crazy. Oh my god,
Colin Firth’s sweater--

PETER
Ooh, so painful.
ZOOEY
Way to put this on your Netflix

cue, baby.
Peter walks to the TV, ejects the DVD.

PETER
So, I know this might sound weird,
but I’m going to try to meet
someone before the wedding.

ZOOEY
What are you talking about?

PETER
A friend. So, if you, or any of
your zillion girlfriends have any
candidates, I just want you to
know, I’m available.

ZOOEY
You’re so ridiculous. You're going
to try and meet a friend?
26.

PETER
Why not? I want a Best Man up
there with me. I don’t want to
look like a big loser when you have
twenty eight bridesmaids, and I
can’t even get One Beer Samir to
show up on my end.

ZOOEY
I know you’re just doing this for
me.

PETER

Yeah, but, I really love you, so,
it kind of feels good.

ZOOEY
I am so happy you walked into our
store that day.

She kisses him.

PETER
You wanna try and do it before
Hailey gets home from her new date?

ZOOEY
Shut up, jerk.
(then)
She’1ll be back in a few minutes, so
it’s gonna have to be a quickie.

And as they start taking off their clothes, we FADE UP A SONG
and begin a montage of Peter’s man-dates. We see the set-
ups, and the dates in a series of SPLIT-SCREENS AND JUMPCUTS.

INT. BARRY AND DENISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Denise talks quietly to her husband, BARRY, in the doorway.
Behind them, Peter sits at a poker table with BARRY’S ASSHOLE
FRIENDS.

BARRY
The guy has no idea how to play
poker!

DENISE

Barry, this is important to Zooey,
so shut the fuck up and be nice.
27.

BARRY
Only if we can have sex with the
lights on when you get home.

DENISE
Fine.

BARRY
Love you.

DENISE

Love you too.

INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY
Peter is talking to his female co-workers...

PETER
.»+.so if you know any available
men, just feel free to give ‘em my
number, or E-mail if that’s easier.

OLDER FEMALE CO-WORKER
I have the perfect person! Peter,
please take my husband off my
hands!

EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
As Peter valets his car, we hear his MOM talking in V.O..

JOYCE (V.O.)
Honey, he just moved to L.A..
Barely knows anyone. He’s an
architect. His mother says he’s so
excited to meet you.

Peter waves to an attractive guy, DOUG, waiting outside. The
guy mouths, ‘Peter?’ Peter nods, they shake hands.

INT. EQUINOX GYM - WEST HOLLYWOOD - DAY

Robbie talks to a CLIENT as he helps him with a lat pull-
down.

ROBBIE
.«..my brother’s a great guy, fun to
be around.
(beat)
(MORE )
28.

ROBBIE (CONT'D)
And I‘1l give you five free
sessions if you go out with him.

INT. STAPLES CENTER - NIGHT

Peter watches a basketball game with Robbie’s gym client, who
we now realize has A VERY HIGH VOICE.

HIGH VOICED GUY
Pass the goddamn rock, you piece of
shit! He’s so selfish, you know?

PETER
He really is.

HIGH VOICED GUY
What is your problem, Zebra?! That
was a foul!

Peter is clearly embarrassed to be with the guy.

INT. JANS FAMILY RESTAURANT - DAY

Peter eats an Early Bird Special with an OLD MAN who studies
the chocolate drink in front of him.

OLD MAN
The perfect Egg Cream is two parts
seltzer water, one part whole milk,
and then, and pay attention here,
one part U-Bet Chocolate Syrup. No
other brand will suffice, you
understand me?

Peter nods, trying to hide his boredom.

INT. BARRY AND DENISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The poker game is in progress. Peter pushes his CHIPS into
the middle.

PETER
I guess I’m all in. Is that how
you say it?

BARRY
Yes, Peter, that is how you say it.

PETER
I’m sure you beat me. I just have
five of the same suit or whatever.
29.

Barry looks like he’s ready to kill Peter.

INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Peter and Doug, the attractive guy, are hitting it off as
they share a bottle of wine, getting a little tipsy.
INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - HOME OFFICE - NIGHT
As Peter works on the website for the Ferrigno Estate, he
looks out his window, sees his neighbor now hosting a
backyard barbecue with his buddies.
Peter GOOGLES: ‘How do you meet straight male friends?’.
His eyes land on a site called “MEET-NEW-FRIENDS.COM.”
INT. STAPLES CENTER - NIGHT
The high-voiced guy is chanting at the top of his lungs.
HIGH VOICED GUY
LET’S GO... LAKERS! LET’S GO
LAKERS!

Peter winces, covers his ears in agony.

INT. JANS FAMILY RESTAURANT - DAY
The old man has FALLEN ASLEEP at the table. Peter gently
wipes DROOL from his mouth with his napkin.
INT. BARRY AND DENISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Barry and his friends play a drinking game called BOAT RACES -
- where you must chug a beer then tap the guy next to you who
chugs as well, until one team finishes first.
On his team, Peter gets tapped, starts CHUGGING his beer,
until he gags and THROWS UP all over the GUY next to him.
EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Peter and Doug exit, hand their tickets to the VALET.
PETER
I gotta tell you, I really enjoyed

this, Doug.
(MORE )
30.

PETER (CONT'D)
I’ve been out with so many jerks,
it’s great to finally meet someone
I can have an actual conversation
with.

DOUG
Let’s do it again.

PETER
I'd love to.

DOUG
Tomorrow night? Matsuhisa. Eight
o'clock?

The Valet pulls up in Doug's car.

PETER
I will see you there, sir.

Peter starts to extend his hand, when Doug reaches out AND
KISSES PETER ON THE MOUTH. He withdraws, enters his car,
leaving Peter standing there, stunned.

INT. PETER’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Peter is on speakerphone with his mom.

PETER
He put his tongue in my goddamn
mouth, Mom!

JOYCE (0.S.)
How could I know he was gay?! All
Rita said was her son wanted to
meet my son!

PETER
And you didn’t think for a minute
that she was talking about your son
who sleeps with men?!

JOYCE (0.S.)
It was one kiss. I don’t know why
you’re so upset?

PETER
You know why I’m upset?!
(beat, then)
Because I really liked him! He's
terrific!
31.

INT. PETER’S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

Peter is chatting with a man named LESTER on “MEET-NEW-
FRIENDS.COM.” Lester types in the three most exciting words
in any online relationship: “SHOULD WE MEET?”

Peter’s eyes widen.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

A nervous Peter enters, scans the room for his friend. He
eyes several POTENTIAL CANDIDATES, when he hears:

LESTER (0.S.)
Peter?

Peter turns, sees an ELEVEN YEAR OLD KID wearing Harry Potter
glasses and a pointy Wizard’s hat with stars and moons on it.

PETER
Lester?

Confused, Peter approaches Lester’s table, when...

BEHIND HIM -- Lester’s square-jawed father, BUTCH, runs up to
Peter, puts him in a choke-hold.

PETER (CONT'D)
Ahh!!!

BUTCH
Stay away from my son, sicko!!!

Other PATRONS and EMPLOYEES start to notice the scene. Peter
tries to speak while Butch chokes him...

PETER
He said he was thirty eight! I
just wanted to meet a friend!

BUTCH
He’s eleven years old, you freakin’
pedophile You think I don’t read
his e-mails?!

LESTER
But, Dad--
BUTCH
Stay out of this, Lester!
(to Peter)

(MORE )
32.

BUTCH (CONT'D)
You contact my son again, pervert,
I will murder you where you live!

And with that, Butch tosses Peter out of the Starbucks.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The couple lie in bed, reading design magazines. Peter's
neck is swollen and red.

ZOOEY
How’s your neck?

PETER
Not bad. Still a little tender.
Zooey, I’m sorry, this friend thing
obviously isn’t working out.

ZOOEY
I kind of figured that. Denise
said you threw up all over Barry's
poker buddies.

PETER
Because they made me play this
stupid drinking game. That’s
exactly why I wasn’t ina
fraternity. Look, I tried. I just
don’t think I’m going to find a
Best Man by June 30th.

ZOOEY
Honey, it’s okay. You can’t just
manufacture a good friend.

PETER
I mean, I can go on some more man-
dates, but, I have the Open House
this weekend...

ZOOEY
Peter, forget it. Seriously, I
don’t care. Just please, stay off
the internet. It’s a horrible way
to meet people. You should talk to
Hailey about it sometime.

Beat. Then, Peter shakes his head...

PETER
He said he was thirty eight.
33.

EXT. FERRIGNO ESTATE - DAY

Even more impressive than it looked on the website. An OPEN-
HOUSE SIGN with Peter’s name is prominent on the front lawn.
INT. FERRIGNO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

From the MOVIE POSTERS and MEMORABILIA, it is clear that this
house belongs to Lou FERRIGNO, the hearing-impaired body-
builder/actor who starred in the film PUMPING IRON, and, on
TV, as THE INCREDIBLE HULK.

IN A SERIES OF CUTS

We see Peter set up for the Open House.

-He places a stack of INFORMATION SHEETS on a table by the
front door.

-He unwraps a platter of SMALL DELI SANDWICHES on an island
in the kitchen.

-He straightens up the furniture.

-He lights some candles.

-He opens shades, letting golden sunlight in.
-He puts Norah Jones on the stereo system.

-VARIOUS PROSPECTIVE BUYERS enter. Peter chats them up,
tours them around the place.

BY THE FOOD TABLE

SYDNEY FIFE, late 20s-early 30s, takes out the turkey from
one sandwich, adds it to the corned beef from another
sandwich, creating a double-decker. Sydney has a casual,
slightly unkempt appearance.

He watches Peter talking to a YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY and his HOT
GIRLFRIEND. The Hollywood guy nods, tells Peter they’re
going to look around on their own.

Peter walks up to the food table.

PETER
Thank you for eating.
34.

SYDNEY
I’m the first one, huh? I don’t
know why people are so afraid of
chowing down at an Open House.
(beat)
So, how come Ferrigno’s selling?

PETER
He bought a place in Jackson Hole.
I think he’s tired of the Hollywood
grind.

SYDNEY
It’s a great pad. I’m not sure I'd
keep the Pumping Iron posters, but--

PETER
(chuckling)
No, the place will come empty. I’m
Peter Klaven, the realtor.

SYDNEY
Sydney Fife.
PETER
Nice to meet you, Sydney.
SYDNEY
(points to the Hollywood
couple)

You were wasting your time with
those two, by the way.

PETER
Why do you say that?

SYDNEY
I saw that guy pulling in. He
drives a Volkswagon Passat. That's
a thirty thousand dollar car, and
he’s looking at a 4.3 million
dollar house? Doesn’t compute. He
hasn’t been dating the girl he’s
with for more than two weeks, maybe
three. In fact, from their body
language, I doubt he’s slept with
her yet.

(MORE )
35.

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
So, he tells her he’s looking for a
new house, brings her along, hoping
to impress her, which he might,
‘cause she doesn’t look like the
sharpest monkey in the monkey
house, then he’1l sleep with her at
her rental in Toluca Lake, go back
to his one bedroom in Studio City,
having done nothing but gotten laid
while wasting your valuable time.

PETER
Wow. He told me he was going to
make me an offer. I really hope
you’re not right about that.

The Hollywood guy passes Peter on his way out.
YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY

You know what, guy, I like it, but
I’m thinking it’s just a little

small.
They exit.
PETER
Unbelievable.
SYDNEY

Me, I’m going tell you right up
front, I have no intention of
buying this house whatsoever.

PETER
Uh, okay, so, what are you doing
here?

SYDNEY

Pete, I am here, on a beautiful
Saturday afternoon, to eat your
free food and try to pick up a
divorcee.

Peter laughs, shakes his head.

PETER
Are you serious?
36.

SYDNEY
Iam. At the classier Open Houses,
the spread is usually delicious,
plus, aside from the poser
douchebags like the dude who just
left, you normally get a delightful
panoply of financially solvent,
newly single women.

PETER
What can I say? I appreciate your
honesty, I guess.

SYDNEY
Thank you, sir. Is there anymore
Russian Dressing?

Peter stares at Sydney - ‘Is this guy for real?’

INT. FERRIGNO ESTATE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
The two men replenish the bowl of Russian Dressing.

SYDNEY
.-.I do private investments.
Manage my own portfolio. It’s
great. I work from home, keep my
own hours.

PETER
And you can make a living doing
that?

SYDNEY

I’m not exactly flying private, but
yeah, I do nicely. The thing I ask
myself, is, can I afford my
lifestyle? If the answer is yes,
I’m happy. The Europeans have it
right... they work to live, not the
other way around. I tend to adhere
to a more Continental way of
thinking.

PETER
You’re right, in America, you’re
considered lazy if you don’t work a
sixty hour week.

SYDNEY
You ever been to Italy?
37.

PETER
I took a trip there with my ex-
girlfriend.

SYDNEY
So, you know... those people enjoy

their lives way more than we do
over here.

PETER
I gotta say, they did seem pretty
happy.

The bowl of Russian Dressing has been filled.

SYDNEY
Alright, man, I’m gonna fix myself
another sammy, then I have an Open
House in Bel Air that promises to
be replete with Cougars. Nice to
meet you.

PETER
Look, here’s my card. If you ever
need a place, I actually specialize
in smaller homes, bungalows--

SYDNEY
Sounds good. Here, you might as
well take mine too.

They exchange cards. Peter eyes Sydney’s, which reads:
SYDNEY FIFE INVESTMENTS, LLC. They shake hands.

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Thanks for a great Open House,
Pete.

Peter watches Sydney exit, clearly intrigued by this guy.

INT. EQUINOX GYM - WEST HOLLYWOOD - DAY

Robbie is holding down the legs of one of his CLIENTS while
he does crunches as Peter talks to him.

PETER
I can’t just call him.

ROBBIE
Don’t be such a pussy. He gave you
his card. Of course you can.
The sound is awful.

PETER
And say what? ‘Oh, hey, Sydney,
you want to get dinner with me?’ I
hate this. There’s no rules for
male friendships.

ROBBIE
What is the big deal? You went out
with all those other guys?

PETER
Those were set-ups. This is
completely different.

ROBBIE
Fine, then wait around for him to
call. And if he does, no more
dinners, okay? It’s sending the
wrong message.

PETER
I know. Actually, that guy, Doug
who kissed me, he’s really great.
You want his number?

ROBBIE
No, he’s gay. I told you, I’m not
into that.

The High-Voiced Guy spots them across the gym.

HIGH VOICED GUY
Hey, Peter. lLakers/Mavs tomorrow
night?

PETER
Can’t do it. I have... a thing.
(turns to Robbie)
By the way, I can’t thank you
enough for setting me up with that
Castrato. It was really fun.

HIGH VOICED GUY
Come on, push it out! It’s all
you, baby! Yeaahhhh!!!

38.

Shouts out..

ON HIGH VOICED GUY, giving a BENCH-PRESSER a spot.

Robbie looks at Peter contritely.
39.

INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY

Peter sits at his desk, staring at Sydney’s card. He picks
up the phone, hangs up before he dials.

PETER
Just... pathetic.

We JUMP-CUT to, Peter dialing. He gets Sydney’s VOICEMAIL.

SYDNEY (0.S.)
This is Sydney Fife. You know what
to do.

Peter affects a business-like tone.

PETER
Hi, Sydney, this is Peter Klaven.
We met at an Open House last week.
Anyway, I was just checking in,
seeing if you wanted to get
together, talk about real estate or
whatnot. So, if you get a chance,
give me a call. No pressure.
Okay, take care. Bye-bye.

EXT. “ZHD” STORE — DAY

Establishing of this cool-looking home furnishing store on a
trendy street in L.A.’s Silverlake neighborhood.

INT. “ZHD” — CONTINUOUS

The store is filled with modern furniture, housewares,
knickknacks and art.

Zooey, Hailey and Denise sit around the checkout counter,
eating salads, listening to Hailey tell a story.

HAILEY

«+.SO, we go back to his house.
We're kissing. It’s getting a
little heated, I’m like, ‘Okay, I’m
gonna have sex for the first time
in three months. That’s cool.’
Then, he rolls over, opens a drawer
in his night-table... proceeds to
pull out a huge strap-on dildo.
40.

ZOOEY
What’s the deal, he’s a pre-op
tranny?

HAILEY

No, he is a man, and what he asks
me to do, in a very casual tone,
is, strap on the fake penis, and,
uh, screw him with it, in his butt.

DENISE
By the way, you may not be into
that, but, I don’t think it
necessarily makes him gay.

HAILEY
It was a first date, Denise! Who
requests that on a first date?!

Peter enters the store.

ZOOEY
Hey! What are you doing here?

PETER
I was downtown meeting with the
owner of my development site.
Thought I’d say hi on my way back
to the office.

ZOOEY
You just missed Hailey telling us
how a guy she met on J-Date wanted
her to do him with a strap-on.

PETER
Ah.

HAILEY
So, that was my Wednesday night.
How's your man-search coming?

PETER
About the same as yours. It’s
tough, there’s not a lot of great
men out there.

DENISE
Barry said he and his friends had a
good time with you the other night.
41.

PETER
(skeptical)
Really?
DENISE

No. I guess you took all their
money and threw up on them.

Peter’s cell-phone rings. He steps away, answers it.

PETER
Peter Klaven... yes, right,
Sydney. Good to hear from you.
This afternoon? Uh, yeah, sure, I
can do that. Father’s Office at 5.
See you in a jiff.

He hangs up.

ZOOEY
See you in a jiff?

PETER
I know. I’ve never said that
expression in my life.

ZOOEY
Baby, you’re all flustered. Who
was that?

PETER

This guy I met at my Open House,
Sydney something....

DENISE
Oh my god! Peter’s gota
boyfriend!

HAILEY
This is insane! How did you get a
boyfriend before me?!

PETER
I don’t have a boyfriend. We're
just grabbing a drink. Talking
about real estate.

ZOOEY
Don’t forget, we’re having dinner
with Denise and Barry and Debbie
and Max.
42.

PETER

Yup. Edendale Grill at 8.
HAILEY

Guys, what the hell?
ZOOEY

What?
HAILEY

You can’t make a dinner plan
without me. We have an unspoken
pact about stuff like this.

DENISE
It’s a boring couple’s dinner.

HAILEY
Oh, so, because I’m single, I
suddenly have the Ebola Virus.

Peter quietly watches these friends interact...

ZOOEY
You don’t have Ebola, we just
didn’t think you’d want to come.

HAILEY
I’m your best friend. You don’t
think I’d at least want to know?

DENISE
I thought I’m your best friend?

HAILEY
Zooey and I have been best friends
since sixth grade. We didn’t meet
you till college, and you weren't
even undergrad with us.

DENISE
So fucking what?

ZOOEY
Guys, this is ridiculous.

HAILEY
Wait a minute, which one of us is
your best friend?

ZOOEY
I love you both. I’m not gonna
choose.
43.

DENISE
Well, you can’t have two Maids of
Honor, so, at some point, you'll
have to decide.

PETER
(quietly)
I’m gonna take off.

ZOOEY
(waves, then, to Hailey)
Why don’t you just come to dinner?

HAILEY
I can’t. I’m going out with the
strap on guy.
(off their looks)
What? We had a really nice time,
until he asked me to fuck him in
the ass with a rubber dick.

EXT. FATHER’S OFFICE RESTAURANT - DUSK

Peter’s on his cell phone as he walks into this famous Santa
Monica gourmet beer and burger pub.

PETER
I’m meeting him right now.

ROBBIE (0.S.)
Peter, play it cool, okay? No
dinner. You don’t want him to
think you’re easy.

PETER
Yes, I promise, no dinner.

ROBBIE (0.S.)
Ooh, this is exciting! Call me
when you get home!
INT. FATHER’S OFFICE RESTAURANT - DUSK
Peter and Sydney sit at a table drinking pints of beer.
SYDNEY

So why’d you call it quits with
your last girlfriend?
44,

PETER
Lindsay? We were right there on
the marriage track, but, then I
found out she was a kleptomaniac.

SYDNEY
Oof. Those are the worst.

PETER
Yeah, she shoplifted from stores,
from my parents’ house. One time
we went to Disneyland with her
nephews, she got busted for
stealing a case of Mickey Mouse
golf balls.

SYDNEY
She was a golfer?

PETER
A golfer? No, you’re missing the
point. She was a thief.

SYDNEY
Yeah, no, I get it. I’ve just
always wondered if having a
girlfriend who could join you for
eighteen would be a blessing or a
curse. Anyway, go on...

PETER
Right, so, when it started getting
really out of control, I called it
off, and, I literally met Zooey the
day after we split up.

SYDNEY
Really? No laj in between the vag?

PETER
What does that mean?

SYDNEY
You didn’t have any lag time
between women?

PETER
I didn’t plan it that way, but, it
just happened. Zooey’s super
smart, we’re both really into
architecture, home design.

(MORE )
45.

PETER (CONT'D)
I swear, we can make an entire
night out of, like, going through
the photos in the latest issue of
Metropolitan Home.

SYDNEY
How's the sex?

PETER
What?

SYDNEY

You’re going to be making love to
one woman for the rest of your
life. So, is it good?

PETER
That’s kind of private, you know?

SYDNEY
Not really. It’s something we all
think about on a minute by minute
basis, but, we’re not supposed to
talk about it? Why?

Beat. Peter thinks about this.

PETER
You’re right. I guess, no one’s
ever asked me the question, that’s
all. The sex is good. Very good.

SYDNEY
Your voice when up when you said
that.

PETER
So what?

SYDNEY

It means, you weren't being
entirely truthful. What’s the
deal?

PETER
I don’t know, I guess at times, I
wish she enjoyed, you know...

SYDNEY
Getting in it the tush?

PETER
What?! No. Oral sex.
46.

SYDNEY
She doesn’t like it when you go
down on her?

PETER
No, that she likes. It’s the other
way, she doesn’t seem to... what am
I doing? Sydney, I barely know
you. Look, Zooey’s an awesome
woman, we have a great sex life. I
don’t know why I said that.

SYDNEY
‘Cause you're speaking honestly.

PETER
What about you? Are you single?
Married?

SYDNEY
Iwas. I got devoed a year ago.
We started out great, but, Leanne
got too needy. Never gave me my
space. I finally said ‘enough.’

PETER
I’m sorry. Divorce sounds really
tough.

SYDNEY

It was rough for a while, but, the
truth is, Pistol, I’ve never been
happier.

PETER
What does that mean, ‘Pistol?’

SYDNEY
Pete Maravich. Great basketball
player. Nickname was The Pistol.

A YOUNG COUPLE hovers over their table -- as is tradition at
this restaurant where you have to fight for a seat.

YOUNG GUY IN COUPLE
You guys finishing up soon?
SYDNEY
Sorry, chief, we’re actually
staying for dinner.

Peter’s eyes widen.
47.

PETER
Oh, you know what, Sydney, I should
get going.

SYDNEY

Dude, are you serious? They
literally have the best burgers in
the world here. If you get a seat
at Father’s Office, you do not
leave without eating.

Peter’s clearly considering it.

PETER
Alright, screw it. I’min. Let me
just call Zooey.

EXT. FATHER’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Peter’s on his cell.

PETER
...we’re in the middle of something
here. Just tell them I had a work
emergency.

ZOOEY (0.S.)
Peter, we made a plan.

PETER
I know, but, we see those guys
every week. It’s just one time. I
gotta go, I'll see you later. I
love you.

INT. FATHER’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Peter returns to the table.

SYDNEY
All good?

PETER
All is good. All is good in ‘da
hood.
(off Sydney's weak-smile)
So...

As he sits, the BARTENDER puts a new song over the sound-
system, and we begin a SERIES OF DISSOLVES...
48.

INT. FATHER’S OFFICE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Peter and Sydney drink several more pints and eat the
restaurant's gourmet hamburgers, clearly hitting it off.
They crack up. Have a serious conversation. Talk heatedly.

It’s a GREAT FIRST MAN-DATE.

EXT. FATHER’S OFFICE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Peter and Sydney stumble out of the place.

PETER
Hands down, best hamburger I have
ever had. I love the way they
caramelize the onions.

SYDNEY
People say it’s the meat, but I
agree, the onions set it apart.

PETER
Alright, I should grab a cab. I
think I’m over the legal limit.

SYDNEY
Dude, you only had like three
pints. You’ll be fine. My Vespa
blew a tire on the way over. You
mind giving me a ride home?

INT. PETER’S CAR - NIGHT

Peter drives. Sydney rides shotgun.

PETER
How could you hate Salman Rushdie?

SYDNEY
The guy’s a phony. Had you ever
heard of him before The Satanic
Verses?

PETER
No, but--
49.

SYDNEY
Butt cheeks. He was a struggling
novelist who wrote a book that he
knew was gonna drive the Ayatollah
crazy, get him a ton of publicity
in the process, and sure enough,
the guy puts a fatwa on his head.
Next thing you know, he’s an
international celebrity, writing
songs with Bono, he marries the hot
chick from Top Chef, lives like a
king in some four star London
hotel... on the government’s dime.

PETER
(cracking up)
So you’re saying he wanted the
death threat on his life?

SYDNEY
Wanted it? The man loved every
goddamn minute of that fatwa. I
guarantee you, he begged the
Ayatollah not to take the price off
his head.

A SIREN behind them flashes onto their car.
PETER

Oh shit! Sydney, this is bad, I’m
sure I’m over the legal limit.

SYDNEY
Stay calm and let me do the
talking.

PETER

No, don’t say anything! You have a
breath mint or a piece of gum?

SYDNEY
Peter, relax, it’s gonna be okay.

Peter pulls the car over. A COP approaches.

COP
Excuse me. You have any idea how
fast you were going?

PETER
I am so sorry, sir. I thought was
under the Speed Limit.
50.

COP
Actually, you were going forty
three in a twenty five M.P.H. zone.

PETER
Got it. Whatever you need to do,
write me a ticket, anything. I
just want to make things right.

The cop picks up on Peter’s overcompensating. Sniffs.

COP
You gentlemen been drinking this
evening?

SYDNEY

Yes, we have, friend.

COP
Excuse me?

SYDNEY
We had a few pints at a bar in
Santa Monica. My buddy’s wife just
left him for a Mexican guy. He
walked in on the two of them
banging in his laundry room.

COP
Uh-huh.

SYDNEY
If that’s not bad enough, she tells
him she’s taking the kids, all the
savings, moving down to freakin’
Guadalajara with this yag-off. So,
I dragged my man out, got hima
little toasted to try to balm the
pain. He’s probably one drink over
the limit, two-max.

Beat. Then...

COP
Fucking Mexicans.

SYDNEY
You said something there, my
brother. Steal our jobs. Steal
our women. Where does it end?
COP
I don’t know, friend. I do not
know. Just, keep it under the
speed limit, okay, fella. Hope
stuff works out for you.

PETER
I do too. Thanks, officer.

The cop leaves. Peter turns to Sydney, exhales for the first

time in a minute.

PETER (CONT'D)
My wife ran off with a Mexican
guy?! Where the hell did you get
that?!

SYDNEY
The cop had an indentation where
his wedding ring used to be, so I
figured the cheating spouse angle
was a good bet. The Mexican part,
was an assumption that he was a
racist, based on his buzz-cut,
vocal intonation, and general
demeanor.

PETER
Sydney, that was incredible.
Disturbing, but incredible.

SYDNEY
Just so you know, and I’m serious
about this, I have no problems with
Mexicans whatsoever. I was just
trying to get you out of a DUI.

PETER
Got it.

They resume driving.

PETER (CONT'D)
I just realized, I never asked, are
you interested in buying a house?

SYDNEY
Uh, no, why would I be?

PETER
Oh, just when you called me back, I
didn’t know if you wanted to talk
real estate, or--
52.

SYDNEY
Look, Pete, maybe this is weird to
admit, but, you seemed like a good
dude. I was just... seeing if you
wanted to get a beer.

PETER
No, there’s nothing weird about
that at all. Why can’t two guys go
out for a beer? I’m glad you
called.

SYDNEY
Me too.

Peter looks over, they exchange a quick smile, drive on.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

In the bedroom, Zooey is sleeping. Peter tiptoes in. Zooey
speaks in that half-asleep voice.

ZOOEY
That wasn’t nice.

PETER
Come on, Zo, we always go out with
your friends. It was one time--

ZOOEY
I know, I just missed you. Did you
have a good time.

PETER
It was fun. We mainly talked
business, but, he’s a cool guy.

ZOOEY
So, is he your Best Man?

PETER
(laughing)
I barely know him. Go to sleep, I
just want to see if we got any hits
on Ferrigno.

PETER’S HOME OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Peter’s on the phone with Robbie, speaking quietly.
53.

ROBBIE (0.S.)
Peter, I’ve been on pins and
needles! Where the hell were you?

PETER
We ended up having dinner.

ROBBIE (0.S.)
No! I told you, no dinners!

PETER
I know, but he insisted. Anyway,
we had a great time. He’s really
interesting. He called me a
nickname. “The Pistol.” No one’s
ever called me a nickname before.

ROBBIE (0.S)
Listen to me. You need to play it
cool. Do not call him tomorrow.
Give it a day or two, okay?

(to someone 0O.S.)
Jump in, I'll be right there!

PETER
Who's that?

ROBBIE (0.S.)
I’m taking a bath with one of my
clients.

HIGH VOICED GUY (0.S.)
Robbie, come on, I’m getting
lonely.

PETER
The castrato?! That guy’s gay too?

ROBBIE (0.S.)
He is now.

PETER
You are such a slut.

ROBBIE (0.S.)

I know. It’s retarded. I’ma
total “Himbo.” I’11 call you
tomorrow.
54.

INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY

Peter is at his desk when Tevin Downey comes over, singing
his version of the old Tag Team rap “Whoomp! There It is.”

TEVIN
Whoomp! There he is! Whoomp there
he is!

He grabs Peter, begins to jostle/tickle him. Peter hates
this, but can’t stop from laughing.

PETER
Okay, man.

TEVIN
Whoomp! There he is!

PETER
Tevin, seriously, cut it out! I’m
fucking ticklish!

TEVIN
Okay, Uncle-Uncle! How was the
Open Hizzy?

PETER
The Open House? It was good. I’ve
had a few nibbles, no bites yet--

TEVIN
Peter, can I speak to you as a
friend? You're a flats guy, and
the Hollywood Hills are my
specialty.

PETER
True, I’ve sold mainly in the
flats, but--

TEVIN
For singles and doubles, you’re the
freakin’ Ichiro Suzuki of realty.
But, we’re dealing with a Hollywood
celebrity here. This is the house
of Mr. Louis Ferrigno. That’s rare
air, my man.

PETER
Did you see my web-listing? It
looks great.
55.

TEVIN
To sell a plot like that, you gotta
network, meet a lot of people, work
the town. It’s what I did with
Scotty Baio’s pad up on Wonderland
Ave. We got her done before she
even went on the market.

PETER
What are you saying, Tevin?

TEVIN
You've got the steak and I’ve got
the sizzle, so let’s split the
listing. Let me wet my beak a
little on this action and we’1ll
both end up winners.

PETER
I really think I can handle this by
myself.

TEVIN

Hey, it’s your call. Like I said,
I’m putting on my friend hat here.

Tevin gives Peter a final tickle in the ribs, walks away.
Stressed, Peter takes out his bottle of Zantac, pops one.

Nearby, he sees the receptionist talking to a female realtor
who holds a HARRY POTTER book. He looks closely at the cover
-- a picture of Harry in his wizard garb.

CLOSE ON LESTER MARSH

Peter’s underage internet friend, playing with a sword in his
backyard. He still wears the Harry Potter glasses and
wizard’s hat.

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

Peter sits in the living across from Lester’s parents.
Lester is visible through the window.

PETER
I know, it sounds crazy, but, I
never really had any close male
friends so, I just wanted to meet
someone.
56.

BUTCH (LESTER’S DAD)
Who the hell doesn’t have any
friends?

JOANNE (LESTER'S MOM)
Not everyone was in the military,
Butch.
(to Peter)
He and his pals take that whole
Band of Brothers thing way too far.

PETER
What branch of the military were
you in?

BUTCH

Special Ops. Delta Force. Real
covert shit.

PETER
I see. Well, thank you... for your
service. Anyway, I just wanted to
clear the air and apologize. It
was really an honest mistake.

JOANNE
Apology accepted.

Butch grunts. Peter looks at Lester, through the window.

PETER
Can I ask... why do you think
Lester was on that website?

JOANNE
The same reason you were. He
wanted to find a friend.

Peter nods, clearly touched by this.

JOANNE (CONT'D)
He’s a good kid, he’s just... a
little different.

BUTCH
Let’s call it what it is. He’s a
geek. Eleven years old, he dresses
like Merlin the Magician.

JOANNE
And we didn’t do him any favors
with his name. The other children
call him Lester the Molester.
57.

Through the window, Peter eyes Lester practicing his
swordplay. He’s actually kind of skillful.

PETER
You know, I’m a, uh, fencer. I’m
in a club, it’s all legitimate.
Maybe I could take Lester over
there one day...

BUTCH
Not happening.

PETER
Alright, I just thought he could
maybe channel this sword and
sorcery stuff into a sport. It’s
in the Olympics. It’s very
competitive.

JOANNE
The school therapist did say he
needs more social interaction...

BUTCH
You wear a goddamn mask when you
fence. Who the hell’s he going to
interact with?

PETER
Butch, it’s a surprisingly social
sport.
(hands them his card)
Why don’t you think about it, give
me a call if you change your mind.

ON LESTER -- he looks at Peter, waves. Peter waves back.

INT. PETER’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Peter holds Sydney’s business card. Clearly nervous. He
takes a deep breath, dials.

SYDNEY (0.S.)

Hello?

PETER
Hey, Sydney? It’s, uh, it’s The
Pistol?

SYDNEY (0.S.)
Who?
58.

PETER
Peter... Klaven. From the Father's
Office.

SYDNEY (0.S.)
Hey, man. What’s going on?

PETER
Nothing, no, that was fun the other
night. I’m just seeing if you
wanted to get some lunch sometime.
Just, super casual. But, if you
don’t have time--

SYDNEY (0.S.)

I’m about to take my Puggle for a
jaunt on the Venice Boardwalk. Why
don’t you join me for some eats?

EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - DAY
Peter joins Sydney as he walks his PUGGLE.

SYDNEY
He’s a cross between a Beagle and a
Pug. Greatest dog in the world.

PETER
He’s really cute. What’s his name?

SYDNEY
Anwar Sadat. After Anwar Sadat.
The former President of Egypt.

PETER
Okay. ‘Cause you were a big fan of
his policies, or--

SYDNEY
No, I was looking at an old issue
of TIME magazine with Sadat on the
cover when he was a puppy, it was
uncanny how much they looked alike.

Peter eyes Anwar Sadat, not quite seeing the resemblance.
SYDNEY (CONT'D)

So, how’s Ferrigno coming? Any
offers?
59.

PETER
Not yet. This realtor I work with,
Tevin Downey wants to share the
listing with me.

SYDNEY
And split the commission? What
about that land you want to
develop?

PETER
Yeah, I mean, it would put a delay
on that, but, I gotta sell this
house. Tevin’s a total cheeseball,
but, he markets himself like crazy,
racks up a lot of sales.

SYDNEY
The guy sounds like a douche. Who
needs him?

PETER
He says the listing is out of my
league. Maybe he’s right.

SYDNEY
Bullshit. That’s the insecurity
talking. The way you set-up that
Open House was understated, classy
and elegant. Those sandwiches you
put out were delicious.

PETER
Look, I’m definitely trying to sell
the place, I just--

SYDNEY
No, Pete, trying is having the
intention to fail. You gotta
scratch that word from your vocab.
Say you'll do it. And you will.

As Peter considers this, Anwar the Puggle squats down and
poops. When he finishes, Sydney starts walking away.

PETER
You need a plastic bag or--

SYDNEY
Nah, I don’t pick up after my dog.

PETER
Oh. Isn’t it like a State Law--
60.

SYDNEY
It’s a ridiculous rule. Dog poop
is like compost. It has an
enormous amount of nutrients that
enrich the soil.

Just then, a MALE JOGGER, steps in Anwar’s shit.

MALE JOGGER
Goddamnit! Clean up after your
dog!

And Sydney gets up right in his face.

SYDNEY
MIND YOUR OWN FUCK-HOLE! YOU ARE
LUCKY TO STEP IN MY BEAUTIFUL
PUGGLE’S SHIT!

Spooked, the jogger runs away.

PETER
Jesus, Sydney, what was that?!

SYDNEY

(totally calm)
I’m aman, Peter. I have an ocean
of testosterone flowing through my
veins. Society implores us to act
civilized, keep everything under
control. But, the fact is, we’re
animals. And sometimes, we need
to let it out.

(then)
Try it.

PETER
Try what?

SYDNEY
Scream. Come on, you're stressed
about the Ferrigno house. I
guarantee you’re anxious about your
wedding in ways you’re not even
aware of. Let it out, you’ll feel
better.

PETER
I can’t just scream in the middle
of the Venice boardwalk.
61.

INT. UNDER THE BOARDWALK - MINUTES LATER
Peter and Sydney are alone. Peter quietly screams.

PETER
Abh...

SYDNEY
Okay, good. Now, gently remove
your vagina and try it again.

PETER
Aaahhh!!!

ABOVE THE BOARDWALK

We hear Peter scream louder. PEOPLE notice, concerned.
Peter does it again -- with even more gusto. And as he
finally lets out an incredible loud, guttural wail....

EXT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

Establishing of a decent sized bungalow in Santa Monica.
Sydney leads Peter across his small yard, towards a GARAGE.

INT. SYDNEY’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

The two men enter. Peter’s eyes widen as he takes in the big
leather couch, which sits in front of three large screen TVs.

In a corner of the room there’s a music area with a drum
kit, guitar, bass, tambourines. A bong sits on a trunk which
serves as a coffee-table. On the walls, dozens of PHOTOS of
Sydney with his GUY FRIENDS -- singing karaoke, white-water
rafting, at restaurants, at the Grand Canyon, etc.

SYDNEY
Mr. Klaven, welcome to the Temple
of Doom.

Peter takes it in, wide-eyed.
PETER
Holy shit, Sydney. This place is

insane.

Peter spots a laz-e-boy recliner next to a side-table with a
tube of Jergens and a box of CONDOMS.
62.

PETER (CONT'D)
What’s going on over there?

SYDNEY
(totally unembarrassed)
Oh, that’s where I jerk off.

PETER
Okay, I see. And the condoms--

SYDNEY
I wear them while I masturbate. It
decreases sensitivity, so I can
last longer, and also there’s no
mess to clean up.

PETER
Are you kidding me?

SYDNEY
Uh, no, I’m absolutely serious.

PETER
And... when women come over--

SYDNEY
Pistol, this is a man-cave. No
woman has ever been granted access.

PETER
What about your guy friends?
You're not embarrassed to have that
out?

SYDNEY
Masturbation is part of life.
You’ve never talked about jerking
off with any of your friends?

PETER
No, I haven’t.

SYDNEY
When’s the last time you did it?

PETER
I’m not telling you that.

SYDNEY
What are you afraid of? I’m not
going to tell anyone. Think of
this place as a cone of silence.
Just then,

63.

PETER
Zooey went to the Pasadena Flea
Market with her friends this
weekend. I did it while she was
out.

SYDNEY
What’d you use? Internet? DVD?

PETER
That’s enough info for today.

SYDNEY
An old porno VHS tape?

PETER
I used a picture of Zooey ina
bikini from this vacation we took
to Cabo San Lucas.

SYDNEY
You jerked off to a picture of your
own girlfriend?! Are you sick?!

PETER
(laughing)
Why is that so wrong?

SYDNEY
Pedro, it is wrong in so many ways,
I can’t even begin to describe it.

Peter’s cell-phone rings. He picks it up.

PETER
Hey, honey. No, I’m over at
Sydney’s house. Uh... nothing,

we're just chilling. I guess I
kind of played hooky this
afternoon. Yeah, no, I‘ll see you
at home later. Love you too, bye.

He hangs up.

SYDNEY
Why’d you tell her you bailed from
work?

PETER

I didn’t want to lie to her.
You’re one of the most honest
people I’ve ever met, you can’t
understand that?
64.

SYDNEY
I’m honest with my friends. With
women, it’s a whole different
thing.

PETER
That’s ridiculous.

SYDNEY
No, it’s not. There’s stuff you
share with dudes you could never
tell your girlfriend or wife.

PETER
I just don’t agree with that.

SYDNEY
Okay, so, when you go home you’1l
tell Zooey that you jerked off to
her picture last weekend?

PETER
No, but..

SYDNEY
But, you just revealed that to me.

Sydney shrugs. Outplayed, Peter’s got no response. He walks
over to the cluster of MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS in the corner.
There’s a poster for the band RUSH on the wall behind the
drumset.

PETER
Which one do you play?

SYDNEY
I’m a drummer. A stick-man. You
play an instrument?

PETER

I played guitar in high school.
SYDNEY

Oh, were you in a band?
PETER

No. I just played by myself. For

fun.
(then, eyeing the poster)
Oh, man, I used to love RUSH.
65.

SYDNEY
Dude! Best rock band in the world!
Neil Peart, hands down, greatest
stick-man who ever lived. We
should jam sometime.

PETER
That’d be fun, man. Alright, I
should hit the road.

SYDNEY
Coolio. I gotta get to bed early.
I’m taking a day-hike in Malibu
with some of my buddies tomorrow.

Peter is clearly taken aback by this revelation.

PETER
Oh, good. A buddies hike. That
sounds fun.

SYDNEY
(off Peter's vibe)
You’re welcome to join us.

PETER

Oh, no, thanks. I promised Zooey
we'd deal with some wedding crap
tomorrow.

(like it’s ridiculous)
Gotta get those “seating charts”
figured out.

(Sydney nods, doesn’t

care)
Alright, well, then, I‘1l, uh, I
will see you...I will see you, uh,
sometime soon. Good hang, Syd.
Really fun hang. I'’11 see you.

SYDNEY
Adios, Pistol.

PETER
Later-gater.
INT. LUCKY STRIKE BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

Peter joins Robbie, who wears a league tee-shirt, inside
this hip “bowling lounge.”
66.

PETER
I’m acting like a freak. He told
me was going hiking with his
friends and I got jealous! What am
I supposed to do, tell him I want
to be exclusive?!

ROBBIE
You have a little man-crush, that’s
all. Just make sure he’s not a
friend slut.

PETER
What’s that?

ROBBIE
Someone who’s constantly picking up
new friends, dumping old ones.
Like Lance Armstrong.

PETER
Why is Lance Armstrong a friend
slut?

ROBBIE

Because, every week there’s
pictures of him in US Magazine
working out with another guy. It’s
Jake Gyllenhaal one day. Matthew
McConaughey the next.

PETER

(then, noticing something)

How long has dad been in your
bowling league?

PETER’S POV - OF THE LANES

We now see that Oz wears a matching shirt. He bowls a
strike, does a “crotch chop” a la professional bowler Pete
Weber, and hi-fives several of Robbie’s GAY TEAMMATES.

ROBBIE
He started rolling with us a few
months ago. The boys love him.

Oz gives one of the TEAMMATES an encouraging slap on the ass.
PETER

I mean, it definitely seems like he
likes me.
67.

ROBBIE
He sounds great. I just don’t want
you to get hurt, that’s all.

Peter eyes his brother appreciatively.

PETER
Thanks, Robbie.

They’re interrupted by Oz and one of Robbie’s FLAMBOYANT
BUDDIES doing a post-strike chant...

OZ/FLAMBOYANT FRIEND
The roof/The roof/The roof is on
fire!

INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY
Peter is at his desk when a RECEPTIONIST calls out...

RECEPTIONIST
Peter, I have Lou Ferrigno for you
on line three.

AT HIS DESK -- Tevin Downey quietly lifts up his receiver,
listens in on Pete’s conversation.

BACK ON PETER - on the phone with Lou Ferrigno.

PETER
Mr. Ferrigno? Peter Klaven. It’s
nice to finally speak to you in
person.

As he listens to Ferrigno, Peter looks concerned.

PETER (CONT'D)
I’m sorry, could you speak a little
slower. I’m just having trouble
understanding you. Yes, sir, of
course, I know you’re hearing
impaired--

BY THE FRONT DOOR - Sydney Fife enters the office. The
receptionist directs him towards Peter’s cubicle.

PETER (CONT'D)
...if you’re saying that you’re
concerned about the house, don’t
worry. We’re holding another Open
House this weekend.
68.

Peter looks up, sees Sydney. Lights up.

PETER (CONT'D)
(quietly, motions to
phone)
Ferrigno.
(into phone)
I think I understand. We’ll get it
done. I promise. Goodbye.

Peter hangs up. Highly stressed. Tevin puts down his
receiver, scheming.

SYDNEY
The Hulk busting your balls?

PETER
I think so, it was kind of hard to
tell. I’m not trying to be... it’s

just, he’s hearing impaired, and he
was on a cell. What are you doing
here?

SYDNEY
My sperm bank is a few blocks away
on Westwood.

PETER
Are you kidding me?

SYDNEY
No, I deposit every couple of
weeks. I may as well get paid for
something I’m gonna do at home
anyway.

PETER
I want to argue with you about
these things, but, you do make a
certain kind of twisted sense.

SYDNEY
I got some leftover Koo-Koo Roo at
the house, you want to get some
lunch, squeeze in a little jam
session?

PETER
I can’t, Syd. I gotta deal with
this Ferrigno situation.

Peter pops a Zantac.
69.

SYDNEY
What do you have, acid reflux?

PETER
It comes and goes.

SYDNEY
Dude, you’re not going to get
anything done in this state. You
need to get some grub and let out a
little steam. I guarantee, you'll
be more focused when you get back
to the office.

INT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

CLOSE ON SYDNEY - sitting at his drum kit. He kicks out a
beat. Then, in a blaring, Geddy Lee-style falsetto, he sings
the opening lyrics to the RUSH song “Tom Sawyer.”

SYDNEY
A modern day warrior, Mean, mean
stride, today’s Tom Sawyer, mean,
mean pride!

WIDER -- Peter has Sydney’s guitar slung around his neck. He
starts playing the ensuing chords...

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Though his mind is not for rent,
Don't put him down as arrogant, His
reserve, a quiet defense, Riding
out the day's events...

SYDNEY (CONT’D) PETER
The river! The river!

And as they jam, we begin a MONTAGE under the music...

EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - DAY

Peter and Sydney walk Anwar Sadat. Sydney points out a DOG
OWNER who looks uncannily like his DOG.

SYDNEY
I call them ‘Bowsers.’ It’s my
nickname for people who look like
their dogs.

PETER

‘Bowsers?’ Where did you get that?
70.

SYDNEY
Who knows? It just sounded right.

A MUSCLE BEACH BODY BUILDER steps in Sadat’s poop. He
confronts Sydney who starts screaming at him.

A beat later, Sydney shouts ‘Run!’ And he and Peter take off.

EXT. EMPTY LOT - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

Peter shows Sydney his development site, explaining what he
plans to do with it.

EXT. THE MARSH’S HOUSE - DAY

Butch leads Lester to Peter, who waits in front of his car.
Lester’s still wearing his wizard get-up. Butch whispers in
Peter's ear...

BUTCH
You try any molestation with my
son, I’1l cut off your scrotum with
a pearing knife. Is that clear?

PETER
Yes, sir.
(then, peppy, to Lester)
Alright, Lester, you ready to do
some fencing?!

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The two of them sit at the dining room table, going over
details for the wedding. Peter’s cell rings. It’s Sydney.
He excuses himself, starts gabbing with his friend.

INT. FERRIGNO ESTATE - DAY

Peter holds another Open House. Sydney emerges from the
bedroom.

SYDNEY
This place is exquisite. I’d like
to make an offer!

Other prospective buyers take note.
71.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Peter takes a hike with Sydney and his FRIENDS -- a diverse,
group of guys. A CHUBBY FRIEND stops, out of breath. Sydney
stops the group, helps his friend through some deep-
breathing. Gives him some water. The friend recovers,
thanks Sydney.

Peter watches on, impressed at how caring Sydney is.

INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Peter teaches Lester the basics of fencing.

INT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

The music continues...

CLOSE ON A FRAMED TIME MAGAZINE COVER OF ANWAR SADAT.
CLOSE ON SYDNEY'S PUGGLE.

ON PETER - eyeing the magazine cover and the dog as he
continues to jam with Sydney.

ON SYDNEY - sweating profusely as he pounds away.
SYDNEY

I’m doing it, man! I’m going full

McConaughey!
And Sydney rips his shirt off, his flabby stomach pulsating
with the rhythm of his drumbeat. Peter cracks up, goes crazy
by unbuttoning the top two buttons of his dress-shirt.
INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
LESTER IS A FENCING PRODIGY.
He and Peter engage in a tense match -- all that sword and
sorcery stuff has clearly found its outlet.
EXT. L.A. STREETS - DAY
Peter and Sydney cruise through Main Street in Santa Monica

on Sydney’s VESPA. Peter notices a MAN who looks just like
his dog. He calls out...
72.

PETER
Bowser! Two O'clock

Sydney sees him - the two friends crack up.

INT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

The song is reaching it’s climax. Sydney is now stripped
down to his UNDERWEAR, sweating profusely as he screams in
his off-key falsetto.

Peter’s shirt is completely unbuttoned, while he jams out the
remaining bars to the song.

INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Lester DEFEATS Peter. He triumphantly whips off his mask, a
huge smile crossing his face.

INT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

And as Sydney stands up on his drum-seat, hits the symbol
with his toe, before he LOSES HIS FOOTING and crashes into
his KIT... we END THE MONTAGE.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
IN BED - Peter and Zooey flip through design magazines.

ZOOEY
.--he’s kind of got a point about
Salman Rushdie. I’d never heard of
him before that Iran thingie.

PETER
Sydney’s theories are definitely
out there, but he’s like this
weird, street philosopher.

ZOOEY
He sounds really cool. When can I
meet him?

PETER
I actually invited him to the
engagement dinner.

ZOOEY
Wow, Peter, this is serious.
73.

PETER
It’s not. It’s totally mellow. He
got divorced recently. I thought
he and Hailey might hit it off.

EXT. YANG CHOW RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Establishing of this famous restaurant in the heart of L.A.’s
Chinatown neighborhood.

INT. YANG CHOW RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

The Klaven’s have taken over one of the restaurant’s small
BANQUET ROOMS for Peter and Zooey’s engagement party. Peter
introduces Sydney around.

PETER
...my brother, Robbie.

ROBBIE
Hey! This is my date, Alan.

Robbie introduces them to the MARRIED GUY from the gym.
PETER

And this is my fiance, Zooey Rice.
Zo, this is Sydney.

ZOOEY
Hi! I’ve heard so many nice things
about you.

SYDNEY

Same. Pete is like, absolutely ga-
ga over you. It’s adorable.

Zooey squeezes Peter’s hand.

ZOOEY
We feel really lucky.

Zooey sees Hailey nearby.

ZOOEY (CONT'D)
Hailey, come meet Sydney.

Hailey walks over.
ZOOEY (CONT'D)

Sydney, this is Hailey. My oldest
friend in the world.
74.

SYDNEY
How you doing?

Hailey is overtly flirtatious in a faux-shy manner.

HAILEY
Really good, Sydney. So nice to
meet you.

ZOOEY

Ooh, there's Denise and Barry.
Peter, come say hi.

Zooey pulls Peter away, leaving Hailey and Sydney alone.
MOMENTS LATER
Barry and Peter are talking.

PETER
I can’t remember, do you play an
instrument, Barry?
(points to Sydney)

‘Cause my friend, Syd, and I have
been jamming a lot lately. He’ a
stick-man and I wield the axe, so,
it’s a good time.

BARRY
I don’t play an instrument, Peter.

PETER
Oh, bummer. I was gonna invite you
to hang with us, but, if you don’t
play, it probably wouldn’t be fun.

ON SYDNEY AND HAILEY
Not hitting it off at all.

HAILEY
How could you hate the Dalai Lama?

SYDNEY
He’s a phony. Always hanging out
with Richard Gere. What is that?
It’s not like he earned his title.

HAILEY
What are you talking about?
75.

SYDNEY
He became the Dalai Lama when he
was two years old. He didn’t win
some kind of Dalai Lama election.
He was a baby.

HAILEY
Well, I think he’s really
inspirational.

SYDNEY

Tell the truth, you just like him
because he has a nice smile.

JOYCE
Okay, everyone! Dinner!

Hailey glares at Sydney, walks away.

BANQUET ROOM - MINUTES LATER

A group consisting of Peter’s parents, Sydney, and Zooey’s
friends sit around a long dining table.

JOYCE
..-ever since Oswald got
transferred to L.A., this has been
Peter’s favorite restaurant. So,
of course, he took Zooey here on
their first date.

PETER
No, I only take the girls I really
like to Yang Chow!

Zooey playfully hits Peter. Joyce continues.

JOYCE
True, true! But, I remember, when
he got home that first night, he
called me up and said, ‘Mom, I’m
going to marry this girl. And it’s
not just because she wanted an
extra order of Slippery Shrimp!’
And, eight months later, here we
are! Peter, Zooey, we're so happy
for you. Cheers!

Everyone toasts. They’re about to eat when Sydney stands up,
clinks his fork against his glass.
SYDNEY
If I could just say a couple of
words.

76.

The guests look confused. Oz quietly turns to Joyce...

OZ
Who the hell is that?

JOYCE
Be nice. He’s Peter’s new friend.

SYDNEY
Zooey, I just want you to know,
that, you are marrying one of the
most honest, caring and fun loving
men I’ve ever had the pleasure of
knowing.

Oz looks to Robbie, mouths, ‘Fun?’ Robbie shrugs.

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
“The Pistol” is a pleasure-giver.
The man lives to make other’s
satisfied. But guys like that
rarely ask for anything in return.
So, as his friend, I’m here asking
you, Zooey, give it back. Return
the favor. And if you do, I
guarantee, you’ll have a beautiful,
and pleasure filled union. To
Peter and Zooey.

The confused guests clink glasses. Zooey looks to

‘What the hell did that mean?’

BY THE LADIES ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Zooey walks to the bathroom by a WALL OF POLAROIDS

eating at the restaurant. She takes them in, when

catches her eye. It’s of PETER, smiling, with his

an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

THE BANQUET ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Various family-style Chinese dishes line the table.
OZ

Sydney, what line of work are you
in?

Peter --

of guests
one
arm around
He exits.

77.

SYDNEY
I do private investments, Oz.
Manage my own money. I holda
bunch of different market
positions. Small Cap, Large Cap, a
few foreign equities...

OZ
What’d you do before you opened
your own shop? Train at one of the
big firms?

SYDNEY
No-no, I never joined that rat-
race. The idea of toiling like a
sheep in the trenches of some
faceless corp while the CEO and his
buddies get rich never appealed.

JOYCE
Oz was at IBM for thirty eight
years.

OZ

I guess I was one of these sheep
you're referring to.

SYDNEY
Not at all, Oswald. I have a ton of
respect for the company man. It’s
just not the way I’m drawn.
(stands up)
‘Scuse me, I just have to use the
little cowboy’s room.

People eat. Zooey turns to Peter.

ZOOEY
Did you know there’s a picture of
you and Lindsay up on the wall?

PETER
There is? Oh, you know what, they
took that a few years ago. I’1l
ask Mr. Wong to take one of us.

ZOOEY
No, I don’t care. I was just,
pointing it out.

Oz shouts across the table to Peter...
78.

OZ
Private investments? What the hell
does that mean?

PETER
Dad, why do you have to be a jerk?
He said he respects people who work
for companies. It’s just not his
thing.

OZ
His thing?! Peter, you’ve known
this yutz for three weeks and
you’re acting like a bigger faggot
than your brother.

The guests look uncomfortable.

ROBBIE
It’s okay, everyone, I gave him
permission to use the “F” word.
Dad, you might be abusing the
privileges.

OZ
Really? Alright, I’m sorry.

JOYCE
Well, I like him very much. He’s
quite a unique individual. And he
clearly adores Peter.

Sydney reemerges with MR. WONG, the happy host.

SYDNEY
I asked this dude to take a picture
of you guys.

Mr. Wong aims a Polaroid camera at Peter and Zooey.

MR. WONG
Smile, happy couple!

Off his FLASH, we, go to...

INT. PETER’'S CAR - NIGHT
Peter and Zooey drive home. Zooey is pissed.
ZOOEY

What the hell did you tell Sydney
about me?
79.

PETER
Uh, nothing. Aside from how much I
love you.

ZOOEY

Then, what was he talking about
with all that pleasure-giver stuff?

PETER
I might have mentioned that, you
know, you don’t love blowjobs.

ZOOEY
Ew! Peter, that stuff is private.

PETER
Oh, it is? Then, how come Hailey
and Denise know every detail about
our sex life?

ZOOEY
It’s totally different. I’ve known
them forever. Sydney is
practically a stranger.

PETER
Well, now you know how I feel when
there’s no privacy with your
girlfriends.

ZOOEY
I thought you liked those guys?

PETER
I love them, but, sometimes I just
want things to be between you and
me.

ZOOEY
Fine.

They drive for a beat.

ZOOEY (CONT'D)

It’s not like I don’t like giving
blowjobs. The thing is, Rodney
hated getting them.

PETER
What guy doesn’t like getting
blowjobs?
80.

ZOOEY
He had this weird intimacy problem.
It’s part of why we split up. So,
I guess I just stopped doing it.

PETER
See? If Sydney hadn’t asked me
about our sex life, we never would
have talked about this.

ZOOEY
I guess so. Still, it was a weird
toast, and he also told Hailey that
he hates the Dalai Lama.

PETER
He did? I love the Dalai Lama.

ZOOEY
I know, he’s got such a cute smile.
He’s like a Tibetan Teddy Bear!

INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY

As Peter heads to his desk, he passes Tevin Downey in his
cubicle, practicing sign language as he reads a copy of
SIGNING FOR DUMMIES. When he sees Peter, he tries to slide
the book under some papers.

TEVIN
Uh-oh! There’s my dog!

PETER
How come you’re learning sign
language?

TEVIN
My aunt is coming to town this
weekend. She’s deaf, so, I want to
brush up on a few phrases.

Peter seems skeptical. He nods, walks away.

PETER’S CUBICLE - MINUTES LATER
Peter’s on the phone with Sydney.

PETER
Me too, Sydney. I’m really glad
you came. I gotta say, Zooey was a
little freaked out by your toast--
81.

SYDNEY (0.S.)

Right, because I was pointing out
the truth about something
uncomfortable. One beej a month
does not a marriage make, my
friend.

PETER
Yeah, no, in the end, I think it
led to a good talk, but--

SYDNEY (0.S.)
Cool. Glad I could help. What are
you up to tonight?

PETER
I’m having a date with Zooey.

SYDNEY (V.0.)

Okay, well, cancel that ASAP,
‘cause I just got an e-mail alert
from the FLY BY NIGHT ARMY.

PETER
What is that?

SYDNEY (0.S.)

Top secret RUSH fan-club. The holy
trinity are playing a small club
gig at THE MINT tonight. I have a
friend who can get us tix.

PETER
That sounds fun, but, I kinda
promised her I would--

SYDNEY (0.S.)

You have your entire life to have
dinner with Zooey. This is a
chance to get up close and personal
with the greatest rock band in
history.

PETER
I would like to check them out.
Can I invite Zooey along?

SYDNEY (0.S.)
Really?
82.

PETER
Yeah, it’d be a good chance for you
guys to hang out, start off ona
new foot.

EXT. THE MINT - NIGHT

RUSH fans pour into this mid-sized L.A. rock club.

INT. THE MINT - CONTINUOUS

Sure enough, RUSH plays in front of a small, packed crowd.
Peter, Sydney and Zooey are crushed between the masses, Peter
and Sydney singing along with LIMELIGHT, while Zooey looks
absolutely miserable.

PETER SYDNEY
All the world’s indeed a All the world's indeed a
stage, And we are merely stage, And we are merely
Players, Peformers and Players, Peformers and
Portrayers, Each another's Portrayers, Each another's
audience, Outside the gilded audience, Outside the gilded
cage! cage!

Zooey looks at Peter like he is a complete stranger. He and
Sydney are lost in the moment, making eye-contact, singing to
each other... Zooey is completely left out.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Zooey gets ready for bed. We can hear Peter on the phone on
his home office. Zooey quietly walks down the hall, sees
Peter through the half-open doorway.

PETER

Dude! I cannot believe they closed
with SUBDIVISION! That was
incredible... you’re right, Neil
Peart is a god. Thanks for hooking
that up, it was a great night.
I’1ll talk to you tomorrow.

(beat)
Love you too, man. G’night.

Zooey is completely shocked that she just heard Peter tell
Sydney he loves him. Peter opens the door, catches Zooey
standing there.

PETER (CONT'D)
Were you spying on me?
83.

ZOOEY
You told Sydney you loved him?!

PETER
I said goodnight, I don’t remember
what I said.

ZOOEY
Peter, what is up with you two?
We're supposed to have a date, but,
instead, you drag me to this
concert. You don’t say one word to
me the whole night. You come home
and immediately get on the phone
with the guy. Are you in love with
him?

PETER
Of course not. Zooey, you said you
didn’t want me to be your best
friend, so, I went out and found
one. And you know what, it’s
great! I did it for you at first,
but, I had no idea what I was
missing. Do you know that I
haven’t taken a Zantac in three
weeks? It’s because there’s all
this stuff I was keeping inside
that I can finally talk about.

ZOOEY
That’s great, but, it doesn’t mean
you can’t share things with me. I
feel like I’m losing you a little
bit.

PETER
You’re not. I promise. I love
you. I just, like having a friend,

that’s all.
ZOOEY
Okay.
He kisses her. Things are heating up, when... Peter’s cell-

phone rings. He eyes the Caller I.D..

PETER
I have to take this.

ZOOEY
Is that Sydney again?
84.

PETER
Actually, it’s Lester. He should
be in bed, I wonder why he’s
calling so late.

ZOOEY
Lester? The kid you met on the
internet? You’re still seeing him?

PETER
I thought I told you, I’m teaching
him to fence.

ZOOEY
No, you didn’t tell me.

PETER
(answers phone)
Lester? What’s going on? Right,
Kim Little, the girl from your
Social Studies class. What
happened?

Zooey starts to walk away, turns back.
ZOOEY
And I liked some of those RUSH
songs. Not that you ever looked at
me to notice.

She exits, leaving Peter on the phone.

INT. NEIMAN MARCUS DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
Peter and Sydney stroll through the formalwear department.

SYDNEY
So, the big day is coming up. How
are you feeling?

PETER
I was feeling good, but, Zooey and
I have been fighting a lot in the
past couple of weeks.

SYDNEY
Why are you marrying her?

Peter stops walking, faces Sydney.

PETER
What kind of question is that?
85.

SYDNEY
It seems like you’ve been in one
relationship after another. Is
Zooey the one, or is she just the
next one?

PETER
No, she’s the one.

SYDNEY
How come?

PETER
Because, I don’t know, we’re in
love and... that’s a hard question
to answer.

SYDNEY
I’m not trying to push you, I’m
genuinely curious. Come on, let’s
try on penguin suits.

FORMALWEAR DEPARTMENT - MEN’S DRESSING ROOM
Sydney talks to Peter behind the dressing room door.

PETER (0.S.)
I’m thinking about asking Tevin if
he wants in on the Ferrigno house.

SYDNEY
Dude, I saw that guy’s face on a
bus-stop ad. You do not need to
split the commission with that
frosted hair jag-off.

Peter walks out, wearing a nice, conservative tux.

PETER
I have to face facts, Syd, I’ma
flats guy. Tevin’s got the flash
needed to sell the place.
(re: the tux)
What do you think?

SYDNEY
Turn around, let me see the back.

Peter turns around. Syd stands up, starts touching the
fabric around Peter's shoulders
86.

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
It’s a bit conservative and I’m not
in love with the drape. I’d like
to see you in something with some
flare, peacock it out a little.

Sydney hands Peter a tux -- flashy, but cool-looking.

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Here, give this one a shot.

PETER
There is no freaking way I can pull
this off.

SYDNEY

You have this image of yourself as
this tight, by-the-book guy, but,
I’ve seen you let loose in the
Temple of Doom. It’s the same
thing with the Ferrigno house --
you have the skills, you just don’t
have the confidence. Try it on.

Peter reluctantly heads back into the dressing room with the
new tux. As he and Syd talk, we INTERCUT between dressing
room and waiting area.

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Hey, so, I wanted to talk to you
about something. I have an
investment opportunity, it’s a
complete winner, but, the problem
is all my funds are tied up in
equities, so, I’m cash poor right
now.

PETER
Uh-huh.

SYDNEY
Yeah, I’ve got a bit of a liquidity
problem, so, I wanted to know if
you would consider loaning me a few
sheckles. I’d pay you back, of
course, with interest.

PETER
How much money are we talking
about?

SYDNEY

I'd need like, five.
87.

Peter exits the dressing room in his flashy tux.

PETER

Five thousand dollars?
SYDNEY

Dude! That looks great!
PETER

It does?
SYDNEY

Don’t forget, Zooey’s artsy. She’s
gonna love that. You're like a
confident, sexy peacock.

PETER
Five thousand is a lot of money.
Zooey’s not really close with her
family, so, we’re paying for the
wedding--

SYDNEY
Pete, enough said. An opportunity
came up, thought I’d ask--

PETER
Can you tell me about the
investment?

SYDNEY
I actually can’t. It’s
confidential in nature.

PETER
Okay. Well, let me think about it.

Just then, DOUG, the attractive guy who kissed Peter on their
man-date spots him.

DOUG
Hello, Peter.

PETER
Doug, hi, how are you?

Awkward beat. Then...

DOUG
You know, it takes a lot of nerve
to spend a beautiful evening with
someone, and never call them again.
88.

PETER
Doug, let me explain, I--
Doug eyes Sydney -- assuming they’re together.
DOUG

I get it, Peter. I just wish I
could take back that kiss, because,
I felt something I hadn’t felt in
years, and, now, I realize, it was
the taste of betrayal.

PETER
It wasn’t the taste of betrayal!

And Doug storms off. Peter turns to Sydney.

PETER (CONT'D)
I can actually explain what just
happened there.

EXT. “THE GROVE” — DAY

Peter and Sydney stroll through this outdoor shopping mall.
Peter holds a Neiman Marcus bag with his new tuxedo.

SYDNEY
From the engagement party, I
figured you didn’t have a ton of
friends, but, I didn’t know it went
that far.

PETER
Either did I. The truth is, it was
never an issue until we got
engaged.

SYDNEY
Wait, so, you were using me because
Zooey wanted you to have a Best
Man.

PETER
Dude, no, that’s not it at all. I
had actually given up on meeting
someone. Then, you came into that
Open House, we hit it off, and, one
thing led to the next.

SYDNEY
I just wish you had told me.
89.

PETER
I was embarrassed. Look, you have
a million friends--

SYDNEY
Who are pissed at me ‘cause I've
been spending so much time with
you.

PETER
Really?

SYDNEY
They’re like a bunch of teenage
girls. They'll be fine. Look, I
just want you to know, you can tell
me anything.

PETER
I really appreciate that, man.
(stops, turns to Syd)
So, listen, about that investment--—

SYDNEY
Pete, forget I even mentioned it.

PETER
No, I’ve been saving my whole life,
plus, you're right, I’m gonna sell
the Ferrigno house. I’m happy to
loan you the money. I know you’re
good for it.

SYDNEY
Really?! Pistol, that’s great!

PETER
It’s the least I can do for the
Best Man at my wedding.

SYDNEY
What are you talking about?

PETER
I want you to stand up there with
me. Are you cool with that?

Sydney looks like he’s going to cry.
SYDNEY

Of course I'll be your Best Man.
It would be my honor.
90.

And Sydney reaches out and gives Peter a warm hug. Unused to
this intimacy, Peter pats him on the back, the way most men
do when they hug.

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Sh-sh-sh, no patting, brother.
When you give a real hug you don’t
pat -- you just hold on and feel
the friendship.

Peter does. It’s different. More intimate. OZ AND ROBBIE
exit the movie theater at the Grove. They stop in their
tracks, as they spot Peter and Sydney holding each other.

ROBBIE
Oh. My. God.

OZ
I know you took away my permission,
but I’m sorry, those two are a
couple of tushy twins.

And then, Doug walks by, shaking his head as he watches Peter
and Sydney’s PDA...

DOUG
Uch. Fucking whore.

.».-only adding to Oz and Robbie’s confusion.

INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - DAY

Peter and Lester have their masks off as they casually parry
with each other.

PETER
It’s right here in L.A., it’s like
the biggest junior fencing
competition in the country. I say
we give it a shot.

LESTER
You think I’m good enough?
PETER
Dude, you’re gonna kick those other
kids’ butts.
LESTER
I don’t really want to do that,

Peter.
(MORE )
gl.

LESTER (CONT'D)
I just want to engage ina
gentlemanly contest and let the
best fencer win.

PETER
Of course. You can do that too.

INT. FENCING GYMNASIUM - LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER
Peter and Lester change into their street clothes.

PETER
So how’s it going with that girl?
What’s her name? Kim Little?

LESTER
I asked her to coffee, she said
she’d never date any one named
Lester the Molester. I think she’s
sleeping with Sam Krickstein
anyway.

PETER
Lester, she’s eleven. I guarantee
you she’s not sleeping with Sam
Krickstein.

LESTER
Making love... whatever. They’re
definitely linked romantically.

Lester puts on his wizard’s hat and Harry Potter glasses.
Peter watches -- considering something.

PETER
Buddy, let me throw something out
here. I’m thinking the glasses and
hat might be getting in the way of
your social life.

LESTER
What do you mean?

PETER
Well, they make a statement. And
it’s not a bad statement. It shows
you’re into magic and sorcery and
whatnot, but, I kind of feel like
you’re a cool dude on your own.
You don’t need the costume to prove
it.
92.

LESTER
You’re saying I should go without
the hat and glasses?

PETER
I’m saying try it. See how you
feel.

Lester considers this for a long beat. Then...

LESTER
You may just have a point, Peter.

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The two of them sit around the kitchen table with pieces of
paper related to their wedding plans.

ZOOEY
So, if Hailey doesn't bring the
strap-on guy, which is pretty
likely, we’ll have an empty seat at
our table.

PETER
Actually, I was thinking Sydney
might sit with us.

ZOOEY
Really?

PETER
I asked him to be my Best Man.

Beat. Zooey takes this in. Then...

ZOOEY
Okay.

PETER
Well, are you happy about that?
Bummed? Give me something other

than, ‘Okay.’

ZOOEY
I feel like he has some issue with
me -- maybe I’m crazy, but that’s

the vibe I get.
93.

PETER
I don’t think that’s the case. You
guys just haven’t spent that much
time together. But, I’1l talk to

him.
ZOOEY

Peter, no, don’t do that.
PETER

Why not?
ZOOEY

Because, then he’s going to think
I’m saying shit about him.

PETER
But you are saying shit about him.

ZOOEY
That’s not the point. I don’t want
you to say anything. Please.

PETER
Okay.

ZOOEY
(back to the wedding
stuff)
Alright, so, we still need to pick
up the marriage license. Can you
do it at lunch tomorrow?

PETER
Um, yeah, I mean, I can move some
stuff around.

ZOOEY
Well, do you have a meeting or
something?

PETER

No, I was just gonna meet up with
Sydney. It’s fine, I'll move it.

ZOOEY
We can make it after lunch if
that’s better.

PETER
Okay, yeah. What about two O’clock
at the Marriage Bureau?
94.

ZOOEY
Fine.

PETER
Hey, I’m excited. It’s becoming
so official!

Zooey smiles weakly.

EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - DAY

Peter and Sydney eat gyros while they walk Anwar Sadat.
LANCE ARMSTRONG and VIN DIESEL roller-blade past them.

PETER
(under his breath)
Fucking Lance Armstrong.

SYDNEY
What?

PETER
Nothing.

SYDNEY

So, what did Zooey say about me
being your Best Man?

PETER
She, was uh, she was cool about it.

SYDNEY
Dude, come on, your voice went up
when you said that.

PETER
Fuck. I’m the worst liar. I
promised her I wouldn't say
anything, but, she feels like you
haven’t made an effort with her.

SYDNEY
Pete, Zooey seems like a great
girl, but, the fact is, she’s not
my friend. You are, and, to that
end, I’m there for you, 100
percent. It’s bro's before ho’s’
with me. Some women have a problem
with that, but, that’s just the way
it is.
95.

PETER
Is that why your marriage broke up?

SYDNEY
Sure, it was a contributing factor.

Across the way, something catches Peter’s eye.

PETER
I knew that’s why he was learning
sign language.

Peter’s POV -- at a boardwalk restaurant, Tevin Downey is
having lunch with the incredibly muscular LOU FERRIGNO.

Too late.

SYDNEY
Holy shit. Is that Downey? We
gotta confront them.

PETER
Syd, no, let me think for second.

Sydney is on the move, storming up to their table.

SYDNEY
What the hell do you think you’re
doing?!

TEVIN

Do I know you?

SYDNEY
No, but I believe you know my
friend, Peter Klaven, who has the
exclusive on this man’s property!

Peter walks up to them.

TEVIN
Hey, Peter. You know Lou Ferrigno,
right?

PETER

Yes, hi, Mr. Ferrigno. How do you
two know each other?

TEVIN
I reached out to Lou, ‘cause, I’m
organizing a fund-raiser for
hearing impaired athletes. It’s a
cause that’s near and dear to me.
96.

SYDNEY
That is total crap, you cheeseball!
Lou, you gave Peter the listing on
the house...

LOU FERRIGNO
I know, and he’s not doing shit
with it!

SYDNEY
That’s bullshit, Hulk! He’s
setting the table, lining up some
serious buyers. This stuff doesn’t
happen overnight.

TEVIN
Peter, who the hell is this guy?!

SYDNEY
Am I talking to you, Hi-Lites? I
don’t think so. Look, Hulk--

LOU FERRIGNO
Please get your hand out of my face
and stop calling me Hulk. I’ma
person, okay?

SYDNEY
(getting really worked up)
You’re a person?! So is Peter
Klaven! He’s busted his dick
trying to sell your house, and you
double-cross him with this Redondo
Beach douchebag!

PETER
Sydney!

SYDNEY
Fuck you, Hulk!

Sydney throws a punch at Lou Ferrigno who dodges it, with
very little effort, grabs Sydney, putting him into a sleeper-
hold, as he gently eases him onto the ground. As Sydney
futilely fights back--

LOU
Easy, easy, don’t fight it.

Peter’s cell-phone rings.

PETER
Hello?!

ZOOEY (0.S.)
Hey, I’m just checking in. I’m on
my way to the Marriage Bureau.

SYDNEY

Ahhh!!! Get the fuck off of me!!!
ZOOEY (0.S.)

Is that Sydney?
PETER

Yes, he got in a fight with Lou

Ferrigno--

ZOOEY (0.S.)
He what?! What is going on?!

PETER
Zooey, I don’t think I can make it.
I’m really sorry.

ZOOEY (0.S.)
How could you not make it?! Peter---

PETER
Zo, I gotta go!

SYDNEY
He’s choking me! The Hulk is
choking me!

INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
They stand in the kitchen. Zooey is dumbfounded.

ZOOEY
Why would anyone get in a fight
with Lou Ferrigno?

PETER
Sydney’s a hot-head. He thought he
was standing up for me.

ZOOEY
So did you lose the listing?

PETER
I believe I did.

ZOOEY
And what does that mean for your
development property?
98.

PETER
I probably have to let it go. I
was counting on the commission for
the down payment.

ZOOEY
You have some money saved up.
Can’t you write them a check, you
know, to show your good faith.

PETER
No. Between the wedding, and, then
I lent Sydney some money, I’m just
a little short.

ZOOEY
Wait-wait, you lent Sydney money?

PETER
For an investment. All his money
was tied up in equities, so... I
mean, he’s going to pay me back.

ZOOEY
Peter, that’s not the point. We’re
getting married. You can’t keep
that kind of stuff from me.

PETER
Can I ask you something? Why do
you think we’re getting married?

ZOOEY
What are you talking about?
PETER
Sydney asked me the question, you
know, ‘Why Zooey?’ And I... of

course I love you, but, I’m not
exactly sure how to answer that.

ZOOEY
Are you kidding me? Two weeks,
before our wedding you’re asking me
why we're getting married?

PETER
I... it just came up. Okay?
Forget I even asked.
99.

ZOOEY

You know, Peter, in my opinion,
that’s the kind of thing you figure
out with your friends, not your
fiance.

(anger building)
So, I am going to stay with Denise
and Barry, and you and your pal
Sydney can hang out, and go to RUSH
concerts, and fight Lew Ferrigno,
while you try to answer the
question of why the hell you
proposed to me after only eight
months of dating. Okay?! Goodbye!

She exits, SLAMMING the door behind her.

PETER’S HOME OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Peter’s on the phone with Sydney.

PETER
This is good? How is this good,
Sydney?

SYDNEY’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
(INTERCUT CONVERSATION)

SYDNEY
Because, Pistol, you need to be
sure. This will give you some
space to think about what you’re
doing. I’m going to Joshua Tree
with some of my buddies for the
weekend. Why don’t you come with?

PETER
Did you hear what I said?! Zooey
walked out on me! How can I think
about taking a male-bonding weekend
trip?! And also, why do all you
guys always go to Joshua Tree?!

SYDNEY
Peter, in times of stress, your guy
friends are who you can count on.
This is exactly the time for you to
be doing that. Alright, Seinfeld’s
on Letterman. I gotta go.
G’night.
100.

Peter hangs up, looks out the window. His neighbor is now
sharing an INTIMATE ROMANTIC DINNER with a date. They laugh,
then, he kisses her. Peter looks troubled. His phone rings.
He picks it up.

PETER
Hey, Lester. Yes, tomorrow
afternoon. I’11 pick you up.
What? No, I’m fine. Nothing.
Just some stuff with Zooey. I’11
see you tomorrow.
EXT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - MORNING

Peter looks like crap as he walks towards his car.

INT./EXT. PETER’S CAR - MORNING

He drives to work when something catches his eye.

PETER
Oh my god.
PETER’S P.O.V. -- there is a huge BILLBOARD of Peter, a la
James Bond in a tuxedo, pointing a gun at the lens. A sign
beneath reads: “PETER KLAVEN. LICENSE TO SELL.” At the

bottom, his office number at Remax Realty.

Peter turns a corner -- sees ANOTHER BILLBOARD with his
likeness. This time, he’s in a suit, with Ray-Ban sunglasses
tipped onto his nose, like a poster for a cheesy 80s movie.
The slogan reads: “PETER KLAVEN. THE MARKET’S SO BRIGHT,
HE'S GOTTA WEAR SHADES.”

PETER (CONT'D)
Oh. My goddd!

Peter turns into his office parking lot. Right across the
street, another billboard. In this one, he’s dressed as a
COWBOY, (with a thick moustache) -- photo-shopped in front of
an Olde West Street. The slogan reads: “PISTOL” PETE KLAVEN.
THE FASTEST REALTOR IN THE WEST.”

PETER (CONT'D)
Oh. My. Gooooddd!!!

INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY

As Peter enters, his co-workers, who have clearly been
talking about his billboards, pretend to go back to work.
101.

He heads to his desk, mortified. The older female co-worker

walks by. She’s being genuine...

OLDER FEMALE CO-WORKER
Very creative advertising.

He nods, then makes eye-contact with Tevin Downey, who

mockingly pretends to shoot a gun in his direction.

EXT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - DAY

Peter’s car screeches to a halt in front of the house.

THE GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Peter bangs on the door to the man-cave. Sydney opens

PETER
That’s what you spent my five
thousand dollars on?!

SYDNEY
You saw the billboards?! Pretty
awesome, right?

PETER
Pretty awesome?! “The Fastest
Realtor In The West?!” “The
Market’s So Bright, He’s Gotta Wear
Shades?!” They’re idiotic! I’1l
be the laughing stock of the entire
real estate industry!

SYDNEY
You know what, man, I was trying to
help, okay? That douchebag Downey
has bench ads over the entire West
Side. You need this kind of stuff
to get a leg up on the competition.

PETER
Look, I appreciate the gesture,
but, why didn’t you just tell me?

SYDNEY
Because, I know you, Pistol. I
knew you’d react exactly the way
you’re doing now. So, I figured
I’d take matters into my own hands.

it.
102.

PETER
Sydney, in one day you’ve screwed
up my career, ruined my
relationship--

SYDNEY
By doing what?! Asking why you
wanted to marry Zooey? That’s what
men do for each other.

PETER
I am so goddamn sick of your
ridiculous codes! ‘You can’t tell
women this.’ ‘It’s bro’s before
ho’s.’ Sydney, I like sharing
stuff with Zooey. I like spending
time just hanging out with her.
You know that my favorite night in
the last five years is when she and
I stayed home, made a summer salad,
and watched CHOCOLAT together. And
it was my pick at Blockbuster!

SYDNEY
CHOCOLAT? That is just... I don’t
even know where to begin.

Beat. Then...

PETER
Look, I think we need some time
apart.

SYDNEY

What are you talking about?

PETER
Us. This. Whatever it is we’re
doing here. It’s not working out.

SYDNEY
You know what, man, I have to
agree.

PETER

Right, so, I think it’s probably
best, that, uh... if I do actually
have a wedding...

(this is hard for him)
...that you not be there.

SYDNEY
Sounds good to me.
103.

PETER
And, if you could have those
billboards taken down--

SYDNEY
Will do. And I'll get you that
five grand next week.

PETER
No rush. Oh, and I think you have
my season two LOST dvd’s. I mean,
if you haven’t watched them, you
could just--

SYDNEY
It’s okay, man. Here you go.

Sydney picks up the box-set of LOST, hands it to Peter. The
two men shake hands.

SYDNEY (CONT'D)
I wish you the best of luck, Peter.

PETER
You too, Sydney.
(as he leaves)
Why would you hate the Dalai Lama?
He’s absolutely adorable and he
stands for peace.

And Peter exits.

EXT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Peter heads to his car, passing Sydney’s FRIENDS, who have
just pulled up in a VAN, ready for their weekend away.

PETER
He’s all yours, guys.

They look confused as Peter gets in his car, speeds away.

INT. L.A. SPORTS ARENA - DAY

A major Junior fencing competition is taking place. Peter
stands near the “STRIP” (the fencing area) with Lester, who’s
about to go on. Peter seems really wound up.

PETER
How you doing, Lester? You
nervous?
104.

LESTER
Not really. I feel a strong sense
of inner peace.

PETER
Alright, good. ‘Cause I feel like
I’m gonna throw up.

LESTER
Hey, Peter.

PETER
Yeah?

LESTER

I’m really glad you’re my friend.
Peter’s clearly touched. An ANNOUNCER approaches.

ANNOUNCER
You ready, son?

LESTER
Yes, sir.

The announcer speaks into a mic.

ANNOUNCER

And now, for the final match of the
Los Angeles County Junior Fencing
Competition, from Riverside, we
have Aaron Lieberman. And from
Glendale, we have Lester, the uh...

(confused, as he reads

from a piece of paper)
...Lester “The Molester” Marsh.

Owning the nickname, Lester raises his hand, as he
acknowledges the small crowd.

The two fencers salute each other, as we go into SLOW MOTION.

Lester is incredible. Graceful. Confident. Totally in
control. Peter cheers on his protege.

The crowd grows as word of an incredible fencer spreads
throughout the arena.

The referee continues awarding Lester points.

And, after closing with a flourish, the match ends. The
referee raises Lester’s hand in triumph.
105.

Lester removes his helmet, as a huge smile crosses his face.
The crowd cheers. He gentlemanly bows to his opponent and
shakes his hand.

END SLOW MOTION
Peter runs up to Lester.

PETER
Dude! That was incredible!

LESTER
It was an excellent match. My
opponent was very skilled, but, I
think I got the better of him.

Then, a CUTE GIRL, 12, dressed in fencing gear, approaches.

CUTE GIRL
Mr. Marsh? I’m Kira. I fence in
the Van Nuys club. Would you like
to parry with me sometime?

LESTER
I would very much like that, me-
lady.

CUTE GIRL

Okay, cool. Here’s my e-mail.

She hands him a piece of paper with her info, walks away.
Lester turns to Peter, stunned.

PETER
You got digits!

LESTER
I know! How awesome is that!

They try to hi-five, but end up missing each other’s hands.
PETER
We'll get that next time. Come on,
I’m taking you out to celebrate.
INT. YANG CHOW RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Peter and Lester eat Chinese food.
PETER
-».so, if you and that fencing girl

hit it off, you need to figure out
a place to take her for a date.
106.

LESTER
Like my room?

PETER
No, somewhere public, like a
restaurant, or Pinkberry. One of
the reasons I like to come here
with women is they know me. I’m
familiar with the menu. I’m
comfortable here. Dating is
stressful enough, you want to try
to control your environment as much
as possible.

LESTER
You really know a lot about girls.

PETER
Girls I’m pretty good at. Guys,
not so much. I gotta run to the
bathroom, I’1l be right back.

BY THE MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Peter waits for the Men’s Room to open up. As he does, he
eyes the WALL OF PHOTOS. The Polaroid of him and Lindsay is
still up. But next to it is a new photo, taken the night of
the engagement party, of Peter and Zooey -- looking happy and
in love.

MR. WONG, the owner of the restaurant, approaches. He points
to the new photo..

MR. WONG
Came out nice, right? Where’s your
beautiful fiance?

PETER
Oh, hey, Mr. Wong. Yeah, she, uh,
she couldn’t make it tonight.

MR. WONG
You are lying.

PETER
How the hell did you know that?

MR. WONG
You’re voice got high, like a girl.
I’m not worried about you, Peter.
You’1l bring a new one in here soon
enough.
107.

He pats Peter on the shoulder, exits. Peter takes this in,
then, he turns, looks again at the photos of him with Lindsay
and Zooey. He turns his attention across the restaurant to
Lester, happily eating a moo-shoo pancake, as we go...

CLOSE ON A HAND RINGING A DOOR-BELL

EXT. BARRY AND DENISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Denise opens the door, revealing Peter standing outside. In
the b.g., Barry and his friends are playing poker.

DENISE
Nice billboards. I’11 get Zooey.

Denise exits. Peter makes eye-contact with Barry and his
FRIENDS, who do not look happy to see him.

PETER
(calling out)
I can’t stay. Just came to talk to
my fiance.

Zooey approaches.

ZOOEY
“License to Sell?”

PETER
I know. That’s what Sydney did
with the five grand I lent him. He
thought they’d be good for my
career.

ZOOEY
They definitely get your name out
there. And you look kind of cute
with a thick moustache.

PETER
Zooey, I know why I want to marry
you.

ZOOEY

I’m all ears.

PETER
The truth is, I have been a
girlfriend guy, but, you’re the
first woman I’ve ever been with who
really wants me to have my own
life.

(MORE )
108.

PETER (CONT'D)
I have to come clean, I heard you
talking about me at that ladies
night a couple months ago.

ZOOEY
Of course you did. It was totally
obvious.

PETER

Oh. Okay, well, I thought you
wanted me to have friends for you,
but, I’m pretty positive you
actually wanted that for me. And,
that’s one of the most romantic
things I can ever imagine. So, can
we get this engagement back on
track.

ZOOEY
Yes. I hate it here. Barry and
his friends are awful.

PETER
By the way, I ended things with
Sydney.

ZOOEY

Really? Peter, I hope you didn’t
do that for me.

PETER

I didn’t. He can be a great guy,

but, it just wasn’t working out.
And we FADE UP a slow, acoustic version of the classic Queen
song, “You’re My Best Friend,” over the following:
EXT. PETER’S CAR - DAY
He drives past his development site near downtown L.A.,
clearly upset that it is now out of his reach.
EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - DAY
Sydney walks Anwar Sadat alone. The dog poops. He walks

away. A WOMAN screams at him but Sydney just keeps walking --
doesn’t have the energy to scream back at her.
109.

INT. SILVERLAKE RESERVOIR - DUSK
Peter and Zooey walk hand in hand on jogging path, engrossed
in conversation -- connecting again. A WOMAN jogs by -- she
looks exactly like her DOG.
Peter points her out to Zooey...
PETER
Check it out... she’s a Bowser.
She looks exactly like her dog.

ZOOEY
I don’t really see it.

Peter is clearly disappointed...

INT. SYDNEY’S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

Sydney puts his Jergens and condoms from his jerk-off area
into a drawer. He looks longingly at the music area,
focusing in on the guitar Peter used to play.

INT./EXT. PETER’S CAR - DAY

As Peter drives to work, he looks up, catches one of his
billboards. Shakes his head. But on his face, it’s clear
he’s starting to see the humor in it.

EXT. SYDNEY’S VESPA - DAY

While he drives, he looks up at another “PETER KLAVEN”
billboard. Clearly thinking about his friend.

And we END THE SONG as the montage comes to a close...

INT. REMAX REALTY OFFICE - DAY
Peter enters the office. The RECEPTIONIST greets him.

RECEPTIONIST
Peter, where have you been?

PETER
Oh, my wedding’s this weekend, we
had to do some preparation.
110.

RECEPTIONIST
Alright, well, check your voice-
mail. You have like a million
messages.

Off Peter’s confusion...

PETER CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

He picks up the phone, dials his voice-mail. In a SERIES OF
CUTS, we hear various prospective BUYERS AND SELLERS...

Then..

BUYERS AND SELLERS
‘Is this Pistol Pete? I have a
home in Los Feliz I’ve been trying
to sell...’ ‘Hi, I’m calling for
the James Bond of Real Estate. I
saw the Ferrigno Estate online and,
I’ve lot to take a look at it.’
‘I’m looking for a property in Bel
Air.’ ‘The market’s so bright...
that’s hysterical. Call me.’

LOU FERRIGNO (0.S.)
Peter, hi, it’s Lou Ferrigno.

Great freakin’ billboards! I’m
sorry I doubted you, man. I told
that douchebag Tevin, I want you to
have the exclusive back, so, if you
can forgive and forget, please give
me a call. Oh, and I have a signed
HULK poster for your friend. I
hope his neck is okay. Thanks,
Peter. Or, should I say, “Pistol
Pete.” Call me.

Peter looks out the window, where one of Sydney’s billboards
is mounted. He clearly can’t believe it. Tevin Downey
approaches from the back, starts tickling Peter.

TEVIN

There’s my Dog!

(Peter pushes him away)
Me likey the billboards. I
underestimated you, my brother.
What say we go to Houston's, grab a
burger and a beer and figure out
how we can tag-team this Ferrigno
thing.
111.

PETER
You know what, Tevin. I would
never go for a beer with you.
Because I only do that with my
friends. And you, sir, have no
idea what it means to be a friend.
Now if you’1l excuse me, I have to
go to my wedding. And also, the
next time you tickle me, I’m gonna
punch you in the fucking face, Dog!

And a proud Peter exits the office.

EXT. BACARA RESORT AND SPA - DAY

Establishing of this beautiful hotel overlooking the pacific,
just outside of Santa Barbara, California.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Peter is getting ready in the bedroom, while Oz and Robbie
watch a televised GOLF TOURNAMENT in the living room.

Peter puts on the flashy tux he bought with Sydney. Walks
out to show it to the guys.

ROBBIE
Looking good, Peter.

OZ
(re: the golf)
Get in the hole!

PETER
So, any words of wisdom Dad?

It’s clear Oz and Robbie are totally focused on the golf.

OZ
You’1l be fine.

PETER
Really? No insights about the fact
that I’1l be sleeping with the same
women for the rest of my life?

OZ
To be honest, I really try not to
think about that Peter.
112.

ROBBIE
You know I have nothing to add.

ON THE TV - Tiger Woods putts.

OZ
Get legs!

ROBBIE
I would totally fuck Tiger Woods.

OZ
I don’t blame you. He’s buff as
hell. He’d give you the ride of
your life.

PETER
Guys, I’m getting married in an
hour and you two are my groomsmen.
I mean, come on, give me something.

OZ
It’s the back nine at the U.S.
OPEN, Peter.

PETER
Right, that is important. Okay,
I’m gonna take a walk.

Peter leaves the two of them alone. Oz turns to Robbie...
OZ
You wear condoms when you do it
with all those guys, right?

ROBBIE
Every time.

OZ
Good.

They exchange a nice father/son look. Then...
PETER
(re: Tiger Woods)
Ooh. I think I saw the outline of
his dick in his pants.

INT. CAR — DAY

ON THE PASSENGER SEAT - an audio-book of the Dalai Lama’s THE
ART OF HAPPINESS.
113.

A narrator reads the book over the car’s speakers.
A CELL-PHONE rings.

CLOSE ON SYDNEY, driving, as he picks it up. We hear his
side of the conversation.

SYDNEY
Hello? Wow, I did not expect to
hear from you. You sure it’s a
good idea, I mean, it’s your
wedding? I don’t want to impose.
Alright, well, if I hurry, I might
be able to make part of it. I
know, I’m sorry too. Hey... I’m
really glad you called. Bye-bye.

SLIGHTLY WIDER -- we now see that Sydney is wearing a TUXEDO.
OUTSIDE THE CAR - Sydney’s rental GEO METRO passes a sign
which reads: SANTA BARBARA - 10 MILES.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

Zooey emerges from the bedroom in a bathrobe -- Hailey and
Denise are getting ready in the living room.

DENISE
Zo, this is ridiculous. Who’s it
gonna be?

ZOOEY

Okay, I’ve thought a lot about
this. You're right, I do have a
best friend.

DENISE
Is it Hailey? I knew it! You know
what, that’s great. Seriously. I
get it, you’ve known her longer.

HAILEY
Are you serious? It’s me?

ZOOEY
Would you shut up? It’s not you.

DENISE
Yes!
114.

ZOOEY
Guys, it’s Peter, okay? Peter is
my best friend.

DENISE
Peter is your best friend?

HAILEY
I thought you were skeeved out by
that idea.

ZOOEY
Iwas. But, then I thought about
it and... look, I love you guys...

you know that, but, Peter’s about
to be my husband. He understands
me more than anyone else in the
world. So, that’s it. He’s my
best friend.

HAILEY
That is so sweet.

DENISE
You still have to pick a Maid of
Honor.

ZOOEY
I love you both equally. You’re
going to have to share the job.

HAILEY
I love you so much, Zooey.

DENISE
I love you too, but, honestly, I’m
a little bummed. I thought you
were going to pick me.

EXT. BACARA RESORT AND SPA - DAY

BY THE BEACH -- EIGHTY guests have now taken their seats.
Amongst them -- Peter’s FENCING BUDDIES, the older female
real estate agent and her husband, the OLD MAN Peter went on
a man-date with, Lester’s parents, and his gay date, DOUG.

Peter stands by the altar, with his GROOMSMEN, Oz, Robbie,
and LESTER. Oz leans over, whispers in his son’s ear...

OZ
Hey, I’m sorry I wasn’t there for
you more when you were a kid.
115.

PETER
That’s okay, Dad.

OZ
You just always seemed like you had
your shit together. What’d you
first get laid when you were ten?

PETER
Thirteen.

OZ
Still... not bad. You turned out
good, Peter. I’m proud of you.
Oz warmly rubs his son’s shoulder. Robbie leans over.

ROBBIE
How you feeling?

PETER
Great. I’m ready.

ROBBIE
It’s been fun getting to know you.

PETER
You too, Robbie.

Robbie takes Peter’s hand, sweetly squeezes it.
OZ
Guys, we’re at a wedding, we gotta
stop acting like a bunch of homos.

LESTER
Peter, en garde! Here she comes!

Music plays, and a beaming, beautiful Zooey heads down the
aisle, followed by Hailey and Denise.

The JUSTICE OF THE PEACE whispers to Peter...

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
I’m sorry, but whose got the ring?

Peter eyes his groomsmen, then responds...
PETER

I don’t really have a Best Man, so,
I‘1l just hold onto it.
116.

As Zooey approaches the altar, she takes in Peter’s outfit,
nods her head, psyched.

ZOOEY
Awesome tux.

She stands across from Peter, Denise and Hailey by her side,
along with a long row of BRIDESMAIDS.

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

Good afternoon. We are gathered
here today in this beautiful place,
to join together Peter Klaven and
Zooey Rice in matrimony. If anyone
can show just cause why they may
not be married, let them speak now,
or forever hold their peace.

Beat. Then, from behind the guests, SYDNEY FIFE emerges.

PETER
Oh, shit.

All the guests turn their heads.
SYDNEY
No, I don’t object. Seriously.
I’m all for it. Continue.

Zooey turns back to Peter, smiles at him...

ZOOEY
I hope you don’t mind.

PETER
You invited him?

ZOOEY
I couldn’t let you get married
without your Best Man.

PETER
I love you so much.

ZOOEY
I love you too.

They’re about to kiss, when...
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

Wait! We haven’t even done the
ceremony!
117.

PETER
Right, sorry. Sydney, come on up
here.

He does. Taking his place next to Peter, who hands him his
RING BOX, whispers...

PETER (CONT'D)
I’m sorry about all the stuff I
said.

SYDNEY
Me too, man.
(beat)
Oh, dude, I rented CHOCOLAT.
(then)
Just... delightful.

The two friends exchange a quick laugh as the Justice
continues...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BACARA RESORT AND SPA - RECEPTION AREA - DUSK

Cocktail hour. A BAND plays. Guests mingle. Robbie and
Doug are hitting it off.

IN ANOTHER CORNER, Sydney walks up to Hailey.

SYDNEY
Hey.

HAILEY
Hey.

They stand there for a beat. Then...

SYDNEY
I was wrong about the Dalai Lama.
He’s an amazing guy.

HAILEY
Really? Because, I don’t actually
know anything about him. You were
right, I just like his smile.

ACROSS THE WAY, Peter and Zooey watch them interact -- they
laugh, hitting it off.
PETER
So what happened? I thought you
couldn’t stand him.

ZOOEY

The more I thought about it, the
more I realized he did what a great
friend is supposed to do. He asked
you the really tough questions, and
I’m pretty sure he did it because
he cares about you.

(off Peter's nod)
Plus, you seemed really sad when I
didn’t get that whole Bowser thing.

Sydney approaches.

SYDNEY
Thanks for calling, Zooey.

ZOOEY
I was worried you wouldn’t get here
in time.

SYDNEY

Well, there was no traffic and I’m
a pretty fast driver, so--

PETER
Dude, you’re lying. Your voice
when up when you said that.

SYDNEY
I was five minutes away when Zooey
called. I love you, man. Invite
or not, there was no way I was
gonna miss your wedding. And also,
I wanted to give you this.

Sydney hands Peter a check for FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

PETER
Sydney, you don’t need to do this.

SYDNEY
Pistol, I know you don’t believe
this, but, I’m actually a pretty
successful investor. I told you, I
just had a liquidity problem. The
billboards were a gift.

118.
119.

PETER
Oh my god, they worked! We have an
offer on Ferrigno. My development
site is back on.

SYDNEY
That’s great, Pete. I’m happy for
you.

A bridesmaid motions for Zooey to come over and say hi.
Before she walks away...

ZOOEY
Oh, and, for the record, Sydney, I
do like giving blowjobs. I just
got out of the habit. But, thanks
for looking out for your buddy
here.

SYDNEY
I’ve learned more about how to
treat women from this guy than any
friend I’ve ever had. The least I
can do is make sure he’s getting
bj’s on a regular basis.

PETER
I am just incredibly uncomfortable
with the conversation you two are
having.

ZOOEY
Why? We’re all friends...

EXT. BACARA RESORT AND SPA - UNDER A TENT - NIGHT

Guests are seated at tables as the meal is served. The band
plays. Peter walks up to the bandstand, whispers to the
BANDLEADER, who hands him the mic and motions for the
musicians to stop playing.

PETER
Hi, everyone. Thank you all so
much for being here. Since getting
engaged to Zooey Rice, I’ve learned
a lot about myself, about
relationships, and about
friendships. Zooey, I know you
don’t like me to say this, but, I
don’t care. You’re my best friend,
and I hope that never changes.
120.
