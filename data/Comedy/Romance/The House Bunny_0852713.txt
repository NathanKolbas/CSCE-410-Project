EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION - DAY 1

The iconic Playboy Mansion in all its glory. Peacocks and
flamingos wander amongst topiaries celebrating the female
form. Two hummingbirds feed off the ‘nipples’ of a pair of
topiary breasts.

EXT. MANSION POOL - DAY 2

A lagoon-like oasis where BEAUTIFUL BLONDES frolic and splash
as admiring men watch. We follow a shirtless BUTLER carrying
a tray of cocktails. He passes ADAM LEVINE from Maroon 5 who
sits on the diving board playing an acoustic version of "THIS
LOVE", entertaining the ladies.

ADAM LEVINE
(singing)
"I have no choice, ‘cause I won't
say goodbye any more --"

A nearby girl wearing an oversize T-shirt hears the song.
She drifts toward the music as if in a trance, stripping off
her shirt to reveal her tiny bikini. SCOTT CAAN does a
running cannon-ball into the pool, splashing the girls.

GIRLS
(whiny)
Scott! You're getting us wet!

SCOTT CAAN
Hey Dad, did you see how big that
splash was?

JAMES CAAN is lounging by the pool surrounded by young girls.

JAMES CAAN

Yeah Scott, that’s just great.
(back to girls)

Anyway, then Francis Ford Coppola
says ‘Jimmy, you should direct The
Godfather. After all, you wrote
it.’ And I said, ‘No Francis, why
don’t you do it.’ It felt good to
give the kid a break.

The girls all react, impressed. Then we see HUGH HEFNER
being interviewed.

INTERVIEWER
So Hef, as far as women go, do you
have a ‘type’?
HEF
A type? No, I wouldn’t say I have
a ‘type’.

Widen to REVEAL Hef is surrounded by his three NEARLY
IDENTICAL BUXOM BLONDES.

HEF (CONT'D)

As long as a woman is beautiful on

the inside, that’s what counts.
(noticing)

Speaking of...

We see SHELLEY DARLINGTON, 29, blonde, beautiful, tan,
adorably wide-eyed. Sweet and bubbly, she radiates optimism
and good cheer.

HEF (CONT'D)
There’s my Shelley.

SHELLEY
Hi, Hef!

HEF
(to interviewer )
Shelley Darlington, she’s lived
here at the mansion for almost ten
years. She’s one of my favorites.

Shelley smiles, but at one end of the line of Hef’s girls a
bunny glares at Shelley, obviously jealous of her
relationship with Hef. This is CASSANDRA, 20’s, a hot Bunny
with an ego as big as her boobs.

SHELLEY
You're so sweet to me Hef, but all
the girls here are great.

HEF
And you're like their Mama Bear,
taking care of them all.
Hef's girls all smile, Cassandra just rolls her eyes in
disgust.
EXT. MANSION - POOL - MOMENTS LATER 3
Shelley is treading water when suddenly Scott Caan swims up.
SCOTT CAAN

When are you gonna let me steal you
away from this place, Shelley?
SHELLEY
Don't be silly. Why would anyone
ever leave the mansion?

SCOTT CAAN
Good point. Hey Levine, how about
a chicken fight!

ADAM LEVINE
You just signed your death warrant,
Caan.

Adam Levine ditches his guitar and dives in. Scott Caan
dives under and surfaces under Shelley and lifts her up on
his shoulders.

SHELLEY
Oh, my gosh! I love riding
bareback.

Adam Levine comes up under..

CASSANDRA
(to Shelley; a little too
intense)
You're goin' down...

SCOTT CAAN
Take her, Shelley.

SHELLEY
I don’t want to chicken fight, I’m
a vegetarian...

SCOTT CAAN
It’s not fighting, it’s just fun.

Cassandra grabs Shelley’s head roughly and shoves her back,
Shelley topples with a splash. She bobs back up, drenched and
disoriented.

SHELLEY
Did we win?

EXT. MANSION - POOL —- MOMENTS LATER 4

CLOSE ON a frozen cocktail being poured into a glass. We PULL
BACK to see Shelley, now dry, surrounded by adoring MEN as
MARVIN, the handsome shirtless butler from before, refills
their drinks.
SHELLEY
Thank you, Marvin. You make the
best margaritas.

MARVIN
That’s cuz these are mangoritas. I
invented them myself.

SHELLEY
Wow, they taste so much better when
you spell it that way. Aren’t these
the best Mangoritas guys?

The men -- aging lotharios -- grunt in agreement. The COWBOY
stares at her boobs.

COWBOY
Not as good as the scenery, but
I'll drink ‘em.

Shelley looks behind her.

SHELLEY
Oh, you like the waterfall?

COWBOY
No, darlin', I was talking about
your te-taas.

SHELLEY
(deeply touched)
They’re two years old on Friday.

Cassandra comes walking over.

CASSANDRA
Shelley why are you keeping all the
rich good looking guys to yourself?
I think you should introduce me.

SHELLEY
Of course. This is Cassandra she’s
only been here a few months, but
everybody loves her because she is
super beautiful and she never
throws up on anyone when she’s
drunk.

The men all nod in admiration. Cassandra looks disgusted.
POTBELLY

So, tell us, Shelley, how does a
girl become a Bunny?
SHELLEY
Well, when I was a senior in high
school, my guidance counselor said
he knew the perfect job for me. So
he took a picture of me in my
bikini and sent it to the magazine.
The next thing I knew, I was in LA
shaking hands with Hugh Hefner! And
he told me I didn't have to live in
a foster home anymore. I could live
here and have a whole new family!
So, here I am.

COMBOVER
Are you a centerfold?

CASSANDRA
(catty)
She wishes.

SHELLEY

Yeah, I do so cross your fingers,
hopefully Hef might give me good
news at my birthday party this
weekend...

(sotto; excited)
I have my turn-ons ready and
everything.

POTBELLY
And what might those be...?

SHELLEY
Tanning, giving backrubs,
convertibles, and rude people.
(beat, then)
No, wait, rude people is a turn-
off. I’m such a yummy dummy.

CASSANDRA
True that.

SHELLEY
Being a centerfold is the highest,
most prestigious honor there is.
It says “I’m naked in the middle of
the magazine; unfold me.”

POTBELLY
I suppose it's kinda like the Nobel
“piece of ass” Prize.
They laugh hysterically. Shelley looks confused. Potbelly
puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.

POTBELLY (CONT’D)
(continuing)
Well, darlin', seems like you've
got a pretty good life here.

Shelley beams, dreamily.

SHELLEY
It's paradise --

EXT. PRIVE SALON - DAY 5

CREDITS ROLL and "BIG PIMPIN'" by Jay Z PLAYS, as a limo
pulls up, disgorging a bevy of Bunnies, Shelley happily
leading the way.

INT. PRIVE SALON - DAY 6

We track down a row of salon chairs filled with Bunnies being
beautified. Hair is bleached and blown. Extensions are
attached. Make-up is applied. Unwanted hairs are waxed.

EXT. MANSION/LAWN - DAY 7

Shelley leads the girls in Yoga on the lawn. She moves into
the downward dog position, all the girls follow. A bunch of
gardeners stop what they’re doing to jostle for position
behind the girls to stare.

EXT. DENTAL/TEETH WHITENING OFFICE - DAY 8

All of the girls exit the with big clean smiles. They
excitedly check out each others teeth and look at their own
in little compact mirrors. They all hi-five each other

EXT. MANSION/ZOO - DAY 9

The girls are feeding the animals in their bikinis. One of
the monkeys rips a girls bikini top off. The topless girl
covers her boobs so the monkey can’t see them and everyone
laughs. A girl monkey comes out and smacks the rapist monkey.
10 INT. TRENDY BOUTIQUE - DAY 10

The Bunnies pull skimpy clothes off the rack as they're
attended to by eager Saleswomen. Shelley steps out of the
dressing room in an adorably slutty cocktail dress, twirling
with delight.

CASSANDRA
I love that dress. Too bad it's the
last one.

SHELLEY

It is? Then you should take it.

The salesgirl pulls a red version of the dress off of the

rack.
SALESWOMAN
Here it is in red.
SHELLEY
(excitedly)
Yay! We can be different color
twins!
CASSANDRA
(not excited)
Great.

They all walk over to the counter with arms full of clothes

MANAGER
We'll put this on the Mansion tab
and have it all sent over this
afternoon.

SHELLEY
Aren't we the luckiest girls in the
world?

MANAGER
Yes. You are.

11 INT. MANSION - NIGHT 11

Shelley’s massive birthday party is in full swing. Everyone
is dressed as pirates. Marvin the butler wheels in a huge
cake that says ‘Happy Birthday Shelley’. Shelley makes a
silent wish, then she blows the candles out and everyone goes
nuts.

INT. MANSION - LATER THAT NIGHT 12

The Bunnies are on the dance floor and shake their money-
makers amidst a crowd of admirers. A waitress arrives with a
tray of kamikaze shots. The Bunnies clink, drink and continue
dancing. Shelley, in the center of it all, is having the time
of her life, as we DISSOLVE TO --

EXT. MANSION - MORNING 13

A new day at the Mansion.

INT. SHELLEY'S MANSION ROOM - DAY 14

Decorated with PHOTOS from nine years of Mansion festivities.
Her BUNNY EARS are on a special shelf, lit like an Oscar.
Shelley sleeps, hugging POOTER, her cranky white Himalayan
cat. Marvin (shirtless) enters with a breakfast tray.

MARVIN
Your blueberry French Toast is
ready, Shelley.

He sets them gently on the foot of the bed as she awakens
with a happy smile.

SHELLEY
Ooh, laa laa... thank you, Marvin.
Was that the best party last night
or what?

MARVIN
The best.

Shelley sees an envelope on her breakfast tray.

SHELLEY
What’s that?

MARVIN
It’s from Mr. Hefner.

SHELLEY
(excited)
It is? It must be my birthday
present! Is it finally happening?
Am I Miss November? That’s what I
wished for when I blew out my
candles...
(with sudden dread)
(MORE )
SHELLEY (CONT'D)
Oh my G-d! I told you my wish.
Now it’s not going to come true!
(to envelope)
I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to tell!

MARVIN
Just open the envelope.

She places the envelope over her heart and shuts her eyes.

SHELLEY
(continuing)
Okay, I'm ready.

She opens it and reads aloud.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)
"Dear, Shelley --" Oh, my G-d,
that's me! "Please move out of the
mansion immediately."

She frowns, growing concerned, but keeps reading.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)
"You have two hours to collect your
belongings and leave the premises."
(to Marvin)
Hef's kicking me out? Why would he
do that? This is my home! This is
my family!

Her big blue eyes fill with tears. Marvin feels bad.

MARVIN
I hate to have to tell you this,
but maybe it’s because of your age.

SHELLEY
But I'm 27!

MARVIN
(shrugging)
That's fifty-nine in Bunny years.

Shelley frowns, trying to do the math.
SHELLEY

Maybe if I just talk to Hef, he'll
let me stay.

10.

MARVIN
Mr. Hefner left for Las Vegas this
morning. I don’t think he’s that
great with good-byes.

Shelley starts to cry.

MARVIN (CONT'D)
How bout I make you one last
mangorita for old times sake?

INT. SHELLEY'S ROOM - DAY 15

Shelley sobs and sips her last mangorita as she packs. POOTER
watches disgruntled from his perch.

SHELLEY
Don't worry, Pooter. We'll find a
new place to live. It won't have
coconut pancakes or poledancing
lessons or fireworks on Pamela
Lee’s birthday ... but we'll
survive. Somehow.

Pooter highly doubts this.

EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY - DAY 16

Shelley stands in the driveway with Pooter staring at a rusty
Honda Accord. Marvin carries out her bags.

SHELLEY
Where's my pink Prius?

MARVIN
That car belongs to the company.
This is the car you came here with.

He puts her suitcase in the back. She sighs and gets in,
starting it. She sees Pooter sitting on the driveway,

SHELLEY
C'mon, Pooter. We have to find a
new place to live.

Pooter doesn’t budge.

MARVIN
Here let me help.
17

11.

Marvin picks up Pooter but as he gets closer to the car
Pooter starts freaking out. The harder he tries to put her in
the car the more she digs her claws into his bare chest.
Finally he gives up and stands there with the cat clinging to
his chest.

MARVIN (CONT'D)
She’s seems a little nervous. Why
don’t I keep her here for a few
days till she calms down.

SHELLEY
Okay. Don’t worry Pooter I’1l get
us a nice place to live.

We pull out from the Oklahoma license plate to see the Accord
putting out of the Mansion driveway, backfiring. Through the

back window, we see Pooter running back inside as quickly as

possible. Marvin stands in the driveway waving good bye with

giant scratches all over his chest.

INT. TRENDY BOUTIQUE - DAY 17

Shelley cries as she shops -- retail therapy. Shelley holds
up a dress.

SHELLEY
Will this make me look younger?

YOUNG SALESWOMAN
Absolutely.

The salesperson takes the dress to the counter and rings it
up.
YOUNG SALESWOMAN (CONT’D)
Will that be cash or charge?

SHELLEY
(confused)
Oh, just put it on my tab.

YOUNG SALESWOMAN
The mansion called this morning and
you don’t have a tab anymore.

Shelley looks shocked as the woman takes the dress away.
Shelley makes a helpless little whimpering noise.

Shelley walks up to the reception desk, still tear-stained.

SHELLEY
Jean-Michelle, can you please tell
Svetlana I need to be exfoliated
immediately?
(leans in and whispers)
I'm an old hag.

JEAN-MICHELLE
I am so sorry, Shelley. But the
Mansion called and you are no
longer a Bunny and therefore -- no
longer can we fix your face.

Shelley's makes a louder whimpering noise.

EXT. PRIVE SALON - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

19

Shelley hands her ticket to the valet, JORGE. He holds out

his hand.

JORGE
(continuing)
That will be $7.50.

SHELLEY
For what?

JORGE
For parking.

SHELLEY
But parking is free.

JORGE
Not if you are no longer Bunny.

Shelley is crestfallen. Her world has spun off its
starts crying.

SHELLEY
But -- What am I supposed to do?

axis. She

JORGE
(re the money)
Look, I can’t stand to see a woman

cry, so how about this -- flash me
your boobs and you don’t have to
pay.

SHELLEY
Jorge!

JORGE

Okay, just one boob.

(off her look)
Hey,it was worth a shot. You know
what you need to do?

SHELLEY
What?

JORGE
Get a job.

Shelley looks confused.

JORGE (CONT'D)
(continuing)
What are your skills? Other than
being pretty.

She thinks.

SHELLEY
I can twirl a baton... I can play
roller-blade volleyball... I can
spell almost every word I know,
except for mononucleosis--

Jorge frowns, interrupting her.

JORGE
Do you know how to carry a tray?

SHELLEY
Oh, my G-d! Yes! Is that a job?

JORGE
My cousin is a busboy. Let me make
a telephone call.

INT. IHOP - NIGHT 20

Shelley, in a polyester IHOP uniform, sits in a booth with a
Korean family. She is in the middle of a story. The family
looks confused and a little scared.

SHELLEY
So then Marvin the butler said that
I had to leave because I was too
old. It’s all been really
heartbreaking.

The Korean Grandmother chimes in.

KOREAN GRANDMA
Where Silver Dollar Pancake?

SHELLEY
Um, I know, right. Excuse me! Can
we see the manager.

The manager comes over to the table.
SHELLEY (CONT’D)
Could you see what’s up with these
guys pancakes and can you also
bring me a chocolate shake?

The manager removes his hat and puts on a Donald Trump wig.

MANAGER
You're fired.
CUT TO:
EXT. IHOP PARKING LOT/INT. SHELLEY'S CAR - NIGHT 21

Shelley sits in her car, she looks at a picture of Pooter
that is hanging from her rearview mirror.

SHELLEY
I know it's embarrassing to get
fired after twenty minutes and to
live in a beat up Honda Accord, but
don't lose faith Pooter. I'll get a
great job soon and then a super
place for us to live.

EXT. MATTRESS DISCOUNTERS - DAY 22

Shelley walks in, passing the "Help Wanted" sign in the
window.

INT. MATTRESS DISCOUNTERS - DAY 23

Shelley, wearing a sexy sun dress and a nametag, sits on a
bed. She attempts to assist an OLD COUPLE as they choose a
mattress.

SHELLEY
I used to live with a man your age
and he liked his mattress super,
super firm. Like this one .
You could put a drink on here and
it wouldn’t spill.

She climbs on and begins jumping up and down. Every time she
jumps her skirt lifts up showing her underwear.

OLD MAN
Now that’s what I’m talking about.

As Shelley continues to jump, the old woman fumes.
OLD WOMAN

No one wants to see your lady

garden, Missy!
The old man protests as his wife grabs him by the ear and
drags him out of the store.
EXT. MATTRESS STORE - DAY 24
As Shelley exits the HELP WANTED sign goes back up in the
window.

EXT. SCOTT CAAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 25

The door opens a crack revealing Scott Caan. He looks out at
a downtrodden Shelley on his door step.

SCOTT CAAN
Shelley?
26

16.

SHELLEY
Hey, Scott! Remember how you said
you wanted to steal me away from
the Mansion? Well, here I am!

SCOTT CAAN
Oh, uh, yeah. Actually, I'm here
with my girlfriend --

He opens the door a crack wider and we see his girlfriend --
a six-foot-tall GLAMAZON who looks like she could kick the
shit out of both of them.

SCOTT CAAN (CONT’D)
(continuing)
-- so I can't really lend you that
book you're looking for. But,
thanks for stopping by.

He shuts the door in her face.

SHELLEY
(to herself)
What book?

Behind the closed door we hear the girlfriend yelling.

GLAMAZON
G-ddamnit, Scott. What are you, a
frickin' library?

INT. SHELLEY'S CAR/BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT 26

Shelley prepares to sleep in her car, still full of all her
belongings. Shelley cries, distraught, as she brushes her
teeth. She rinses with Diet Coke. She spits her toothpaste
out the window, then closes it. A moment later, a KNOCK
startles her. She rolls the window back down to find a COP
holding out a ticket.

COP
Ma'am, you just violated code 753.
Unlawful spitting.

SHELLEY
But, I was just brushing my teeth --

COP
(peering inside)
Are you residing in this car,
ma'am?
(MORE )
27

17.

COP (CONT'D)
I'm going to have to give you
another ticket and ask you to move
it.

Shelley sighs and goes to start the engine.

He stares

SHELLEY
Would you maybe stop giving me
tickets if I told you I'm having a
really bad week because I used to
be a Playboy Bunny but I got kicked
out of the Mansion because I'm
fifty-nine years old?

at her for a beat.

COP
Ma'am, step out of the car. I'm
going to have to ask you to take a
Breathalyzer.

She gets out of the car.

SHELLEY
A what?

COP
I need you to blow on this.

Shelley doesn’t look at the Breathalyzer in his hand she just
sighs and bends toward his crotch.

SHELLEY
Alright...

CUT TO:

INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT 27

Shelley sits forlornly in a cell full of PROSTITUTES.

TRASHY PROSTITUTE
You tried to do what? To a cop?

SHELLEY
But I'm not a prostitute. I was
just brushing my teeth...

TRASHY PROSTITUTE
You call it what you like, baby.

18.

CHUBBY PROSTITUTE
Don't worry, sweetie, first-timers
only get one night.

TALL PROSTITUTE
Yeah, you'll be back on the street
in no time.

SHELLEY
You know, you should go with a more
natural look. All that heavy make-
up is just hiding your G-d given
beauty.

TALL PROSTITUTE
(sudden deep voice)
I’m a dude.

SHELLEY
Oh. Then you’re good like that.

EXT. JAIL BUILDING - WESTWOOD - DAY 28

Shelley, make-up smeared, walks down the jail steps. At a
newsstand, Shelley sees Playboy magazine on display. She
looks at it longingly, and as Shelley wipes away a tear, she
sees a group of happy, shiny BLONDE COLLEGE GIRLS. They laugh
together the way she used to laugh with the Bunnies. Drawn as
if to the mother-ship, she follows them as they walk down the
street.

TALL BLONDE GIRL
(continuing)
Did you hear about the pool party
at Jordan's?

SHORT BLONDE GIRL
He makes the best margaritas. He
uses mangos.

Shelley's eyes light up.

EXT. WESTWOOD STREET - DAY 29

The girls round a corner. Shelley does as well taking her
first steps onto --
30

19.

EXT. UCLA GREEK ROW - DAY 30

A tree-lined street filled with large, stately sorority and
fraternity houses. Guys play frisbee. Girls sunbathe on the
lawns. Barbecues are underway. Shelley takes this in with
wide-eyed wonder.

SHELLEY
It’s just like a bunch of little
Mansions!

She hurries to catch up with the girls, following them toward
the Phi Mu house -- the biggest and prettiest of them all.

INT. PHI MU HOUSE - DAY 31

Tastefully decorated and filled with happy blondes. Shelley
enters and looks around, out of place in her skimpy outfit
next to the preppier college girls. ASHLEY, 21, the Phi Mu
President walks up, perfect and perky.

ASHLEY
Can I help you?

SHELLEY
Yes. I'd like to live here, please.

ASHLEY
(sweetly)
Well...you have to be asked to live
here.
She looks Shelley up and down.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
Do you go to this school?

Shelley looks around.

SHELLEY
This is a school? Where are the
desks?

ASHLEY

(still sweetly)
No, this is a sorority house at a
school. And you do look like an
older sluttier version of the type
of girl we would want, but I’m
sorry you’re not a student. It was
so nice talking to you.
32

20.

Ashley turns and walks away.

SHELLEY
But I really--

ASHLEY
So nice.

Ashley exits. Shelley starts to leave, disappointed, when
she spots --

INT. PHI MU HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY 32
A group of SIXTY-SOMETHING WOMEN, talking amongst themselves.

SIGMA KAPPA HOUSEMOTHER
I love what you've done with the
living room. The doilies are
exquisite.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
Thank you. I made them myself. I
feel every detail in the house
should be a reflection of the girls
who live here.

Shelley enters, confused.

SHELLEY
If I’m fifty-nine you guys must be
two hundred and seventy.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
What’s that?

SHELLEY
Nothing, do you guys go to school
here too?

The women stare at her.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
(coldly)
Not anymore. We're housemothers
for the sororities on campus.

SHELLEY
That’s so dope. And you live in the
houses with the girls?

SIGMA KAPPA HOUSEMOTHER
Yes.
21.

SHELLEY
That’s even dopier. What’s a
housemother do?

TRI SIG HOUSEMOTHER
We oversee meal plans, chaperone
the social events, make sure the
girls stay out of trouble...
(rolling her eyes to the others)
Which is a full-time job in itself -

Shelley gasps.

SHELLEY
Oh, my gosh, that’s what I used to
do at the mansion. It’s the perfect
job for me. Can I be one too?

The particularly bitchy PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER, 60, looks her
over.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
I'm sorry, but this is a sorority
not a brothel. We have standards;
standards that you clearly do not
meet. But it was so nice to meet

you.
SHELLEY
What’s a brothel? Someone who makes
soup?...
ALL THE HOUSEMOTHERS
So nice.

The Phi-Mu Housemother gets up and leaves as the others
follow her. The SIGMA KAPPA HOUSEMOTHER lags behind and takes
pity on Shelley.

SIGMA KAPPA HOUSEMOTHER
Try Zeta. Their last housemother
was hospitalized for schizophrenia
and hallucinations.

Shelley perks up.

SHELLEY
Awesome!
33

34

22.

EXT. PHI MU HOUSE - DAY 33

Shelley walks out of Phi Mu, stopping a passing sorority
girl.

SHELLEY
Excuse me, can you tell me where
Zeta is?

The girl points to a house down the street. Shelley turns to
see -- THE ZETA HOUSE. Peeling paint. Dilapidated porch.
Brown lawn. Shelley looks disappointed for a moment, then
steels her resolve and marches down the street.

EXT. ZETA HOUSE - DAY 34

Shelley checks her makeup in a compact mirror, makes sure she
has nothing in her teeth and walks up to the door and knocks.
As she knocks, the Z in "ZTA" falls off and smashes on her
head knocking her to the ground. The door opens and we see
Maria, 21, smart-girl type, with a phone in her hand. She
sees Shelley laying on the porch and rushes to her side.

MARIA
Oh my G-D. Are you okay?

Shelley lifts her head looking a little more dazed than
usual.

SHELLEY
I'm so sorry. I broke your Z.

MARIA
It's not your fault. It falls off
every time we open the door.
She tosses the pieces of the Z into a bush.
SHELLEY
(looking up)
At least you still have T and A.
Shelley offers a high five. Maria stares at her.

MARIA
Who are you?

Shelley pops up off the ground, practically exploding with
enthusiasm.
23.

SHELLEY
My name is Shelley and I'm here to
be your housemother!

MARIA
Well it’s nice to meet you Shelley
but it's too late.

SHELLEY
Oh, no! Did you hire someone else?

MARIA
(helping Shelley up)
No. It’s just that we may lose our
charter, and if we don’t have a
house, we wont be needing a
housemother.

SHELLEY
Why are they going to take your
house away?

MARIA
Well... because we don’t get enough
pledges and everyone thinks we’re
losers.

SHELLEY

That’s so sad. Why does everyone
else get pledges.

MARIA
Uh, they have great parties and
they’re popular and boys want to
date them.

Shelley perks up.

SHELLEY
I'm an expert at parties and boys!
I'm a Bunny! Men write to me from
prison! Sometimes in their own
blood!

Maria frowns.

MARIA
A Bunny? Like a centerfold?
SHELLEY
(blushing)
Bless your heart -- no, just a

couple of small pictorials.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
Girls of the Midwest, Girls of
Starbucks, Girls of Charlie Sheen.
(then)
But now I'm homeless.

MARIA
I’m so sorry. Good luck.

She heads inside and starts to shut the door.

SHELLEY
Wait -- I can help you!

Maria shuts the door. Shelley sighs and starts back down the
walkway. She stops and looks at the guys hanging around Phi
Mu and the other sororities.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
So they want to be popular and have
boys want them...

INT. ZETA HOUSE - DAY 35

Maria shuts the door and turns around to find Mona, 21, a
heavily pierced feminist with a shaved head. She is reading a
piece of paper and wearing a T-shirt that says “legalize
castration”.

MONA
So if we don't get thirty pledges
we lose our charter?

MARIA
Which also means goodbye zeta.

HARMONY, 21, a make-up free hippy chick in a poncho,
overhears.

HARMONY
But I planned on having a drum
circle in the backyard for the
Summer Solstice.

MARIA
I need to worry about getting
thirty pledges right now, Harmony.
Not the three stoners who might
show up for your bongo party.

MONA
Thirty pledges? But there's only
fourteen of us.
36

25.

HARMONY
Fourteen and a half.

Harmony points at BECKY, an eight-months PREGNANT GIRL.

BECKY
Actually fourteen and three
quarters as of last week.

MARIA
They know we're never going to get
that many pledges. It's just their
way of shutting us down.

JOANNE, 21, wearing a large scoliosis brace, walks up, upset.

JOANNE
You guys, this is so awful..
MARIA
I know.
(noticing)

You’ve got some refrigerator
magnets on your brace again.

Maria pulls the magnets off Joanne’s brace.

JOANNE
Oh my G-d...

Joanne is looking out the front window.

JOANNE (CONT'D)
There are boys on the lawn. Our
lawn.

On the front lawn several boys have drifted over to see
Shelley, who is doing YOGA IN HER BIKINI. We see even more
guys approaching.

HARMONY
Are they lost?

JOANNE
I don’t think so.
EXT. ZETA YARD 36
Shelley continues with her poses as guys linger. The Zeta

girls all come out of the house to investigate. A HOT GUY in
a lacrosse shirt approaches Shelley.
26.

HOT GUY
Hey, are you a Zeta?

Shelley looks to Maria, then

SHELLEY
I wish.

HOT GUY
I do too. Cuz Zeta would be my new
favorite hizzity hang.

Maria steps to the front of the pack of Zetas.

MARIA
She’s not a Zeta. She’s our new
hizzity housemother. She’1ll be
hizzity here all the tizzity time.

HOT GUY
(horny )
Ooh, that’s tight.

All the guys on the lawn nod in agreement.

37 INT. ZETA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 37

The GIRLS of Zeta -- a motley crew of 14 various misfits--
sit on ratty couches staring at Shelley as she greets
everyone with unbridled enthusiasm.

SHELLEY
Oh my gosh, you guys! I'm so happy
you want me here! You won’t be
sorry! Hey -- let’s have a pillow
fight!

Shelley grabs a pillow and hits Tanya ( A 21 year old little
person) who rolls hard from the pillow blow into a wall.
Shelley gives a whoopsie look. MONA is appalled.

MONA
This is how we're going to get
pledges? By hiring an archaically
superficial reflection of the male
fantasy?

Shelley smiles and waves, pleased by this "compliment".
27.

MARIA
Exactly -- Guys like her, Mona. And
if you haven't noticed, guys don't
like us.

TANYA getting up off the floor points to the pregnant girl.

TANYA
Apparently some guy liked Becky.

The girls all laugh. Becky does a goofy dirty dancing move.

HARMONY
So, in order to be a sisterhood,
now we have to be "popular"?

MARIA
No. In order to keep our house we
have to be popular. Maybe Shelley
can teach us how.

The girls start talking among themselves. Shelley raises her
hand.

SHELLEY
Okay, look -- let’s put a pin in
the pillow fight, for now. And
don’t get me wrong, I love boys.
But I lived in a house full of
girls for nine years and I know
there is nothing more fun than
being with your sisters, sharing,
talking all night, body painting,
and baking penis cookies.

The girls stare at her. CARRIE MAE, 21, a heavy big toothed
farm girl in jeans and a sleeveless T-shirt, takes the
toothpick out of her mouth.

CARRIE MAE
Where in tarnation did you live?

SHELLEY
The Playboy Mansion.

CARRIE MAE
Jiminy Cricket!

The girls react. Lilly a shy English girl whispers in Maria’s
ear.
38

28.

MARIA
No, that doesn’t make her a hooker
Lilly.

Lilly turns bright red and runs out of the room.

INT. SHELLEY'S ZETA ROOM - DAY 38

Maria leads a bewildered Shelley into a small room behind the
kitchen.

MARIA
Okay, this is your room. Here's the
key.

Shelley sets her bags down on the bed and holds the key over
her heart.

SHELLEY
Thank you so much, Maria. I
promise you I'm going to help Zeta
Tits and Ass become the best
sorority ever!

MARIA
Actually, it's Zeta Tau Alpha.
They're Greek letters.

SHELLEY
Oh my G-d, I met the King of Greece
once at the Mansion! We should
invite him to the next party! He's
really furry but a super good
dancer.

MARIA
Well if it will help us get pledges
invite all the Kings you want.

Carrie Mae enters with a tool box.

CARRIE MAE
Well, ma’am I don’t know about the
other girls but I’m glad your here
cuz we got some stuff that needs
fixing.

SHELLEY
Don’t you have a smelly Russian man
who comes and fixes things and hugs
you a lot?
39

40

29.

CARRIE MAE
We don’t have a pot to pee in. The
smelly Russian man is you.

Off of Shelley’s look.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - DAY 39

Shelley walks out of a stall with the plunger stuck to her
bare midriff. There is an expression of bewilderment on her
face. She looks to Harmony for help.

SHELLEY
Are there instructions for this
thing?

Harmony rolls her eyes, grabs hold of the plunger and starts
pulling. It finally breaks free sending her sprawling.
Shelley looks at the round mark on her stomach.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
Hey, that thing ate my belly ring.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER 40

Shelley is opening and closing the lid of the garbage can.
Mona walks in and stares at her in disbelief. Shelley turns
to her.

SHELLEY
This isn’t broken.

MONA
(pointing to the sink)
The garbage disposal, Bunny.

Shelley walks over to the sink and looks in it. She looks to
Mona.

SHELLEY
What’s the matter with it?

MONA
I don’t know, look and see.

As Shelley looks in the hole Mona flips the switch and a
stream of ground up garbage shoots out covering Shelley's
face. Shelley pulls a completely mangled spoon out of her
mouth.
4l

42

30.

SHELLEY
I found the problem.

MONA
You are so vapid.

SHELLEY
You’re like the hundredth person
who's told me that. Thank you.

INT. ZETA HALLWAY - LATER 41

We see a TOPLESS Shelley from behind, walking out of the
bathroom, freshly showered. Towel around her head and towel
around her waist. As she walks down the hall we see the
Zeta’s diving back in their rooms in shock and embarrassment.
Lilly the shy English girl actually faints. Maria rounds the
corner, reading a letter.

SHELLEY
Afternoon, Maria!

Maria looks up and reels back at Shelley's toplessness.

MARIA
Shelly! Where's your robe?

SHELLEY
Oh, I just like to air dry.

MARIA
I don’t think half the girls here
have seen their own bodies naked
they certainly want to see your
perfectly engineered boobs.

Maria takes off her jacket and puts it over her.
SHELLEY
I’m just walking around in the body
g-d and Dr. Silver gave me.
MARIA
Come with me. We have work to do.

INT. MARIA'S ROOM - DAY 42

Shelley, now dressed, sits down on Maria's bed, all business.
Maria holds up the letter.
31.

MARIA
We have twenty-eight days before
national headquarters shows up with
a For Sale sign.

SHELLEY
You need 30 pledges? How many did
you get last year?

MARIA
One. But she got transgender
surgery and moved to the boys'
dorm. Technically, Bob is still a
Zeta but she’s not allowed to live
here with a weiner.

She points to the Zeta composite picture where we see BOB in
the bottom corner -- a hulking, angry-looking, extremely
masculine girl.

SHELLEY
Well, this year, we're going to get
lots and lots of pledges! The kind
that don't want testicles. Their
own, I mean.

Shelly laughs really hard at this cute joke. Maria waves the
letter she was reading.

MARIA
We also need to raise money for our
philanthropy. We're the only
chapter that didn't meet the fund-
raising requirement.

SHELLEY
What's a philacanopee?

MARIA
Philanthropy. It's like a charity.

SHELLEY
I love doing charity. One time at
the mansion I even let Gary Coleman
grind on me during a slow dance.

MARIA
Look, rush starts in three weeks.
Here's some ideas I came up with
that might make us popular.

She hands Shelley a list.
32.

SHELLEY
(reading)
"Host a 'CSI' night. Start a bee-
keeping club. Have a Googlefest.
B.Y.O.M. Bring your own man?

MARIA
Bring your own mouse.

Shelley tries to be excited, but is in fact, quite worried.

SHELLEY
Oh, wow -- these are super, super
good ideas. But we might want to do
something a little more -- sexy?
CUT TO:
43 EXT. ZETA FRONT YARD - DAY 43
All fourteen Zetas stand outside in baggy T-shirts and
sweatpants -- staring in absolute horror.
HARMONY

Is she serious?

MONA
I am so offended right now.

The object of their scorn is -- Shelley, standing next to a
sign that says “Zeta Car Wash” in skimpy bikini bottoms and a
tank top, hose in hand, sexily sudsing up her own car.

SHELLEY
C'mon girls, washing cars is a fun
and sexy way to raise money.

She undulates with the hose as the girls look on, horrified.
Maria implores them.

MARIA
Just give it a chance --

JOANNE
(re her brace)
I can't bend that way. Plus if my
brace gets wet it could rust.

The girls laugh. So does Joanne.

MARIA
See? We’re already having fun.
33.

Shelley waves to some passing BOYS.

SHELLEY
Hi, boys!

One of them is COLBY, 21, smokin' hot. Maria eyes him with
terrified lust.

MARIA
(sotto)
Oh, my G-d! That's Colby! I love
him! What do I do?

SHELLEY
Do sexy!

As the boys near, Shelley milks it even more, putting on an
act for their benefit.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)
Wash those cars, you sexy bitches!

MONA
Did she just call us bitches?

TONYA
Did she just call us sexy?

A few of the girls are trying halfheartedly to get involved,
Becky has waddled over to the bucket but can’t bend over her
pregnant belly to get a sponge out. Carrie Mae keeps spitting
her chewing tobacco on the car window and scrubs aggressively
at a birdshit stain.. It is not having the effect that
Shelley wanted so she turns the hose on herself, dousing her
chest with water.

SHELLEY
Uh oh, look -- wet T-shirt.

The guys get psyched. Maria picks up a hose and tries to
emulate her.

MARIA
And wet pants!

Maria squirts herself in the crotch, but alas, she does not
look sexy. She looks like she's peed herself.

SHELLEY
Oopsie. Someone went accident in
her sexy pants.
34.

Colby averts his gaze and turns back to Shelley.

COLBY
Yeah. Anyway, we're having some
drinks over at Theta Chi later.
Wanna come over?

SHELLEY
Well, we are a little thirsty...

She drinks suggestively from the hose, then holds it out to
Colby.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)
Wanna sip?

COLBY
Sure.

He bends closer to take a sip as -- NEARBY, Mona cranks up
the faucet so Colby is BLASTED in the face with water. He
jumps back, now soaked, as Mona cracks up. Maria rushes
toward him with a towel.

MARIA
Are you okay?

He takes the towel and gives Mona a dirty look. Mona hits
back with a ‘bring it on look.’ Shelley tries to save the

day.

SHELLEY
So, what time should we come over
for drinks?

COLBY
Now that I think about it, the
guest list is pretty full. Maybe
next time.

The guys walk off as Maria watches in despair.

MONA
(to the Zetas)
I think we're done here “sexy
bitches”.

They all go back in the house.
MARIA

(to Shelley)
I better go talk to them --
35.

She follows, dejected. Shelley is left alone. Then, she’s
sees a good looking guy stapling a flier to a telephone pole.
It’s OLIVER, 30’s, shy and cute. As he walks over to his car
Shelley calls out to him.

SHELLEY
Hi. Do you need a car wash?

Oliver looks around to confirm Shelley is talking to him.

OLIVER
Me? Oh, uh no, I gotta get back to
work.

SHELLEY
Oh. I’m at work right now.

OLIVER
You wash cars?

SHELLEY
No, I’m the Zeta sorority
Housemother.

Oliver approaches Shelley.

OLIVER
Really? You seem too young to be a
Housemother.

SHELLEY
(excited)
Really? You think I’m young?

OLIVER
Yeah.

SHELLEY
How sweet. What’s your job?

OLIVER
I manage a nursing home.

SHELLEY
Oh, it’s so great you give nurses a
place to live.

OLIVER
Actually it’s a home for senior
citizens. You know, old people.
44

36.

SHELLEY
I know lots of old men. Hairy and
not hairy.

OLIVER
Well, I have to get going.

Oliver hands her one of the fliers he was putting up.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
If you ever want to stop by the
nursing home we always need
volunteers to help out and visit
with the seniors.

SHELLEY
(looks at flier)
Thanks. I’m Shelley. I like long
walks and I hate rude people.

OLIVER
(laughing)
Cool. I’m Oliver.

They shake hands warmly, then Oliver goes to his car and
drives off. Shelley looks at his flier, her face lights up
as she gets an idea.

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM - DAY 44

Maria is in the midst of an argument with the other girls.
Shelley enters from the yard, still in her bikini.

SHELLEY
(continuing)
You guys, I just had the best idea
for our philanthropy. We’re going
to volunteer at Oliver’s nursing
home.

MARIA
Who’s Oliver?

SHELLEY
They guy I just met.

MARIA
You see? Shelley knows how to meet
guys, and if guys are hanging out
with us, more girls will want to,
hence, more pledges.
A moment,

The girls

She MEOWS.

37.

then...

HARMONY
Volunteering at a nursing home
seems like a nice thing to do.

murmur in agreement, except...

MONA
Those places smell funny. Like
boiled chicken and pee.

MARIA
Too bad, we're doing it.

SHELLEY
That’s so great! lLet’s get all
dressed up and go to a nightclub
and have fruity drinks and dirty
dance with each other!

CARRIE MAE
For what?

SHELLEY
We need to bond! We’re sisters! At
the Mansion we bonded all the time
and everyone loved us and we had
lots of friends. And once, a
psychic came over and told me that
my cat Pooter and I were cousins in
a past life which totally makes
sense because I can do this --

The girls stare at her.

JOANNE
Why did you tell us that?
SHELLEY
I don't know. I just like that
story.
MARIA

I think what Shelley is trying to
say is that we should go out and
have some fun. Pledges like fun.

BECKY
I like fun...

JOANNE
Me, too.
38.

TONYA
(trying to do shelly)
Meow.

BECKY
It is five dollar pitcher night at
the Think Tank...

Shelley puts her arm around Becky.

SHELLEY
Come on, who’s with us?

HARMONY
I’ve been boycotting that place but
I can’t remember why so I guess we
could go.

Mona rolls her eyes and holds up a textbook.

MONA
I have more important things to do.

MARIA
I think it’s the perfect place for
you to find a thesis topic for your
gender relations class.

MONA
(thinks for a beat)
Okay. But that’s the only reason
I’m going.

CARRIE MAE
(reading a text from her
phone)
Lilly says to have fun but she has
to stay and clean the closet.

A closet door opens a crack and a hand waves goodbye.

45 INT. COLLEGE DIVE BAR - NIGHT 45

Hot drunken college kids eye each other, trying to figure out
who they're going to shag. Bad KARAOKE is going on in the
corner as some frat guys sing Guns n' Roses. The Zetas look a
bit uncomfortable. A bartender pours them a round of kamikaze
shots. Shelley takes one and holds hers up.

SHELLEY
To Zeta! Here's to making you the
best sorority ever!
39.

They all do a shot( Becky goes to but Maria grabs it from
her). Shelley spots a guy staring at Mona's facial hardware
in horrified fascination.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)

Mona, that guy's checking you out.

Flirt with him!

Mona looks over and sidles up to the guy nervously.

MONA
Hi.

GUY AT BAR
I’m going fishing tomorrow. Can I
borrow some of your face lures.

Mona bites him as he screams and runs away. Shelley points
out another guy to Carrie Mae.

SHELLEY
Ooh, there's a big box of
cutesicles --

Carrie Mae checks him out, then walks over, leaning back on
the bar in what she thinks is a seductive pose.

CARRIE MAE
Excuse me. You know where the
shitter is? I gotta take a horse
dump like you wouldn't believe.

The guy bolts. Repulsed. Carrie Mae calls out to him.

CARRIE MAE (CONT'D)
It’s not like I farted!

Shelley frowns.

SHELLEY
We might need to work on your
talking to people skills.

Ashley, the Phi Mu President, and COURTNEY, another Phi Mu,
both perfectly primped, walk past noticing our girls.

ASHLEY
(friendly)
Oh, hey, Zetas! Hi! We never see
you guys out.
40.

The Zetas smile, happy to be acknowledged by the popular
girls.

SHELLEY
Hi! I met you yesterday. I was the
homeless girl.

ASHLEY
Oh right...

SHELLEY
Now I'm their housemom!

ASHLEY
Congratulations.
(to Maria)
Maria, right? I remember you from
the last Panhellenic meeting. You
were the one who wanted to add an
economics day to Greek Week.

MARIA
Oh, my gosh -- we could have a
costume party where people come
dressed as their favorite economist
and anyone who brings a copy of
Capitalism and Freedom can get in
free. Get it? Cuz it’s a book about
free markets.

ASHLEY
Yeah.... hey, by the way, you guys
got here just in time. We're having
a karaoke contest. Sororities
versus fraternities.

She points to the stage where some Kappa Sigs finish their
butchery of "PARADISE CITY".

COURTNEY
You guys could go next if you
want...

The Zetas look at each other, reluctant.

JOANNE
No...

ASHLEY
We'll pick a good song for you.
Don't worry, you can't be any worse
than we were.
41.

COURTNEY
Seriously -- we were wretched.

They gesture for the Zetas to follow them to the stage. The
Zetas hang back.

BECKY
I don't know...

SHELLEY
But, this is perfect! Boys like
singing. It's sexy! Go! Go!

MARIA
I think we could do it...

MONA
We can do anything better than
those mannequins.

TONYA
Count us in.

CARRIE MAE
I think I’m gonna puke.

SHELLEY
That’s the spirit!

They reluctantly get up on stage, looking out shyly at the
crowd, as "LIKE A VIRGIN" starts. They squint at the lyrics
as they flash by on the SCREEN and start singing -- a little
awkward at first.

ZETAS
(singing)
"I made it through the wilderness.
Somehow I made it through..."

From the floor, Shelley gives them a thumbs-up and they keep
going.

ZETAS (CONT'D)
(continuing; singing)

"Didn't know how lost I was until I

found you..."

They find their stride, not sounding half-bad. Shelley beams,
proud.
42.

ZETAS (CONT'D)
(continuing; singing)

"I was beat, incomplete. I'm a hag

and I'm fat and rude..."

Mona and Maria frown and stop singing as the GUYS in the
crowd crack up. Shelley looks around, confused, wondering
what they're laughing at. Nearby, Ashley and Courtney
covertly type new lyrics into the karaoke machine, laughing.

ZETAS (CONT'D)
(continuing; singing)

"But you made me feel, yeah you

made me feel, like a big bag of

poo..."

At this, Tanya and Carrie Mae frown as well, stopping, as the
crowd laughs even harder. Shelley is completely baffled.

SHELLEY
I don't think that's how it goes...

Joanne and Becky continue singing the lyrics, oblivious.

JOANNE /BECKY
(singing)
"Like a loser, we're rejected all
of the time --"

In the crowd, a GUY elbows another guy.

GUY
Cause you're pigs.

Joanne now frowns, realizing, and drops out, leaving only
Becky to belt out --

BECKY
(singing)
"Like a loooooser, we're so
retarded, it's a crime!"

Maria hits Becky on the arm, making her stop. The girls storm
off stage as the crowd cracks up.

SHELLEY
I don't understand what just
happened --

MONA

I do.
43.

Mona marches up to Ashley and Courtney, Zetas and Shelley in
tow.

MONA (CONT'D)
(continuing)
You wanna get cut, bitch?

COURTNEY
Classy, very classy.

MARIA
That wasn't very Panhellenic.

COURTNEY
But it was funny --

ASHLEY
She's right, Courtney. We should
apologize. Especially since we're
about to take their house.

SHELLEY
(confused)
Where you taking it?

ASHLEY
We heard you're losing your charter
so Phi Mu's going to buy your house
when it goes on sale after Rush.
We're going to have so many pledges
we'll need the extra space.

The girls are stricken by this.

COURTNEY
Don’t worry. We'll let you guys
stay on and be the maids. We’1l
probably get a tax break for
helping the socially handicapped.

TONYA
You guys are so mean.
COURTNEY
I’m sorry. Did we hurt your midget
feelings.
SHELLEY
She's not a midget -- she's a

dwarf. Like in Snow White.

A BOUNCER walks up.
46

47

44,

BOUNCER
(to Ashley; re Zeta)
Are these girls bothering you
Ashley?

MARIA
No. We were leaving.
(to the Zetas)
C’mon, let's just go.

As the girls leave, defeated --

COURTNEY
Yeah, you should probably go home.
While you still have one.

CUT TO:

INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - NIGHT 46

Hef has just arrived back home. All the girls are there to
welcome him back. Marvin is bringing the luggage in.

HEF
Marvin can you tell Shelley we’re
back and we’re going to watch a
movie.

MARVIN
Shelley’s not here Mr. Hefner. She
wanted me to give you this note.

He pulls a letter out of his pants pocket and hands it to
Hef. Hef reads the letter slowly. He looks up with a tear in
his eye.

HEF
Shelley moved to Africa to work
with orphans. She left while we
were gone because she says she
can’t deal with good-byes'. I’m
going to bed. No movies tonight.

Hef walks away sadly. So do all the playmates. Marvin steals
a nervous look at Cassandra.
INT. ZETA HOUSE - NIGHT 47

The Zetas sit around the living room, depressed. Shelley
tries to rally them.
48

SHELLEY
Don't listen to those girls!

JOANNE
Why? They're right. We are losers.

SHELLEY
We're not losers!

CARRIE MAE
Well, you're not. People like you.
You're pretty.

SHELLEY
Do you think I looked like this
when I first got to LA?
(whispering)
I had snaggleteeth. And brown hair!

She says this as if it's horrifying.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)
Trust me, I could make you guys way
hotter than Phi Mu. Every girl on
campus would want to pledge Zeta by
the time I was done.

TANYA
(hopeful )
Really?

MONA
(resolved)
Do it. There's no way those bitches
are getting our house.

CARRIE MAE
Damn straight.

As the others agree, Shelley smiles as MUSIC kicks in and a

MONTAGE BEGINS...

INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - DAY

Shelley holds up a handful of padded water bras to the Zetas.

SHELLEY
This is your most important secret
weapon. The water bra. Just stay
away from sharp corners.
49

50

51

46.

MONA
No way.

MARIA
Consider it another thesis topic.
"Conventional archetypes of beauty
and their affect on the opposite
sex."

Mona thinks this over.

MONA
That's not bad...

She takes one of the bras.

INT. ZETA HALLWAY - DAY 49

All of the girls now practice walking in heels, Shelley
demonstrating.

SHELLEY
Boobs out, tummy in. Don't look
down --

Joanne looks so far up that she topples over backwards.
SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)
Or up.
In her brace, Joanne struggles like a turtle on its back, as
the other girls try to help her up.
EXT. ZETA HOUSE - DAY 50
The girls paint the outside of the house. As Carrie Mae hangs
a new "Z", Mona outlines a skull on the wall. Shelley paints
over it with a roller of light blue paint.
INT. SHELLEY'S ZETA ROOM - DAY 51
Shelley gives Tonya 15 inch high heel shoes. Tonya puts them

on. She smiles. She’s never felt so tall before. She runs
over to hug a beaming Shelley and falls immediately.
52

53

54

55

47.

INT. MYSTIC TAN - DAY 52

All of the Zetas get spray-on tans. As Lilly gets sprayed she
giggles like she’s being tickled.

INT. MONA'S ROOM - DAY 53

Mona removes her nose-ring and hands it to Shelley along with
all of her chin rings, lip rings, eyebrow rings, etc. Shelley
runs a metal detector wand over the rest of her. It BEEPS at
her crotch.

SHELLEY
Oh. Go ahead and keep that one.

INT. ZETA KITCHEN - DAY 54

Shelley has turned the kitchen table into a makeshift make-up
counter, complete with illuminated mirror. Mona takes notes
and the girls observe as she gives Maria make-up lessons.

SHELLEY
First, we should highlight your
eyes. The eyes are the nipples of
the face.

Maria and the girls nod, taking in the gospel of Shelley.

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM - DAY 55
Shelley gives flirting lessons to the girls.

SHELLEY
There are three rules to successful
flirtation: eye contact, flattery
and lots of touching. For example --
She pulls Maria to her feet.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)

(continuing)
Let's pretend Maria is a man. My
hand is on his arm, I'm looking
into his eyes, I'm wearing
deodorant -- Harmony -- and here's
what I would say.

(to Maria; babytalk)
"Oh my gosh, your biceps are huge!
Kiss me!"
48.

She turns back to the girls.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)

Then he would kiss me. Any

questions?

BECKY
For how long?

TONYA
With tongue?

CARRIE MAE
What do I do with my Skoal?

Shelley looks overwhelmed by their lack of expertise.

56 INT. FOREVER 21 - DAY 56
Shelley picks out some clothes for the girls.

SHELLEY
Dressing sexy is all about showing
skin in the four major regions --
arms, legs, cleavage and belly.

BECKY (0.S)
Like this?

Becky walks up, her hugely PREGNANT BELLY completely exposed
in a low-cut crop top and a micro-mini. People in the store
look away, horrified. Shelley tries to make the best of it.

SHELLEY
Okay, maybe we can let someone that
doesn't have a giant baby inside of
their belly give it a shot.

57 INT. BEAUTY SCHOOL - DAY 57

The girls all sit in salon chairs, in front of STYLISTS.
Shelley sits off to the side. A sign reads “Hair Extensions
Final Exam”.

SHELLEY
(to the stylists)
Long blonde hair. On all of them.

MONA

How ‘bout this?

EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY 58

All 14 girls of Zeta stride across the quad in SLO MO, now
fully transformed into super hot, clone-like, blonde SEX
BOMBS. They could easily pass for Bunnies. Mona struts...
Harmony strides proudly in her heels... Tonya works her
cleavage with confidence... Even Mona tosses her new hair
with saucy abandon. Guys do double-takes as they pass. Ashley
and some other Phi Mus spot them and react with jealous
contempt.

ASHLEY
Who are they?

COURTNEY
And why is everyone looking at them
instead of us?

EXT. CAMPUS - ON THE ZETAS 59
The girls leave the quad.

JOANNE
(to Shelley)
So, what do we do now?

SHELLEY
I want all the fraternities to see
how hot you are at the same time.
So, we're going to take some
pictures first.

MARIA
We are not posing for Playboy --

SHELLEY
No, Maria, we're raising money for
our phil-an-thro-py.
Maria gives her a thumbs-up at the pronunciation as we...

EXT. KAPPA SIG PORCH - DAY 60

A small cardboard poster of the Zeta girls looking luscious
in bikinis is left at the front door. Zeta Calendar is
printed across the top. An envelope is attached.

EXT. PI KAP PORCH - DAY 61

A flyer hits Pi Kap's front porch as well, waking up a GUY
who's passed out on the stairs.

EXT. THETA CHI PORCH - DAY 62

The door of Theta Chi opens and Colby bends down to pick up
the flyer. STU, stoned, appears behind him.

STU
What's that?

Colby reads the invitation.

COLBY
"You and your friends are invited
to celebrate the debut of the first
annual Girls of Zeta Bikini
Calendar, this Wednesday on the
quad. Meet all the hot babes and
buy the calendar. All proceeds
benefit the Westside Nursing Home."

STU
Zeta? In bikinis? Scary, dude.

Colby scans the poster. He is taken aback by how hot the
girls are.

COLBY
Wait -- check it out -- they're
slammin'.
Stu takes a peek.
STU

Sweet rack on the midget.
Colby gives him a look. Stu misinterprets it.

STU (CONT’D)

Sorry. Little person.

Little person with some big flesh

EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY 63

It is meet the Greeks day on the quad. All of the
fraternities and sororities have booths set up where they can
talk to students and try to get them interested in joining.
Zeta has a double table, on one side Becky is selling
calendars on the other side Maria and the girls are signing
the calendars and talking to possible rushees. Zeta’s booth
is much livelier than the others. They have music playing and
they are handing out cupcakes and sodas.

EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - ZETA BOOTH - DAY 64

Becky is behind a stack of calendars, manning the cash box. A
line of guys waits to buy them. An ALPHA CHI RHO at the head
of the line grins at her.

ALPHA CHI RHO
I'll take two.

BECKY
You guys are so generous.
Everyone’s buying two.

ALPHA CHI RHO
Actually it’s in case one gets
ruined.

BECKY
Oh. (she thinks for a bit then
realizes what he is talking about)
Ohhh!

She hands him his change and he walks away quickly. Nearby
Shelley is surrounded by a circle of admiring SIGMA PIs.

HORNY SIGMA PI
Are housemothers allowed to date
students?

She smiles sweetly and deflects their ardor by pointing to
Carrie Mae.

SHELLEY
Have you met Carrie Mae?
(pulling her over)
She's from Arkansas and her turn-
ons are BMX racing, foul language
and indoor plumbing.

Carrie Mae looks at the Sigma Pis.

CARRIE MAE
Anyone want to arm wrestle or kiss.

There are many takers.
EXT. QUAD - PHI MU BOOTH - DAY 65
Ashley, the Phi Mu president talks to a group of girls.

ASHLEY
At Phi Mu we are very exclusive
because we can be. Many of our
sisters are leaders on campus. We
have a rockin GPA average and our
very own Korean manicurist.

She's interrupted by WHOOPS AND HOLLERS coming from the Zeta
booth where Tanya and Carrie Mae are posing for a pic with a
bunch of guys.

ASHLEY (CONT'D)
(continuing)
What's that?

TARA
That’s Zeta’s booth.

ASHLEY
Don't be ridiculous. Why would they
have a booth and who would go to
it?

A group of hot guys are being fed cupcakes by some of the
laughing Zeta girls.

TARA
(to Ashley)
Didn’t that guy dump you last year?
Ashley fumes.
COURTNEY
Wait, aren't those the blonde girls
we saw on the quad? Why are they at
Zeta?
EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - ZETA BOOTH- DAY 66
Colby, the object of Maria's lust, walks up to her.

COLBY
Sweet set up.
53.

MARIA
(blushing)
Thanks.
COLBY

We should have a mixer with you
guys sometime.

MARIA
How about "CSI" night with pudding!

Colby is a little confused, but goes with it.

COLBY
Sure, sounds good. So, Miss March,
got your bikini on under there?

MARIA
Nope, just my fake water br---

Shelley glides up, saving her.

SHELLEY
Maria, there you are. Bobby and
Zach from Kappa Sig are dying to
meet you.
(to Colby)
I'm sorry Colby, but Maria's a very
hot commodity.

As Shelley steers her off, Maria is taken aback.

MARIA
Wait -- are we leaving? Why? I love
him!

SHELLEY

Then we need to let him see that
you're in demand. Boys like a girl
better if they think that other
boys want her.

MARIA
(excited)
Other boys want me?

67 EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - ZETA BOOTH - DAY 67

Tonya, Joanne and a few other newly blonde Zetas are hanging
with some cute boys as Ashley and Courtney walk up to them.

ASHLEY
What's going on over here?

TONYA
We’re having fun with some guys and
signing up pledges. But you’re not
really our type so, see ya
Sasquatch.
The guys laugh. Ashley frowns.
ASHLEY
Who are you? And where are the
Zetas?
One of the guys snickers.
ASHLEY (CONT'D)
(continuing)
What are you laughing at, Gerald?
Joanne steps up.

JOANNE
We are the Zetas. 2008 edition.

The guys whoop and holler.

GERALD
Oh my g-d, I’m in love.

Out of frustration Ashley punches Courtney in the boob.

COURTNEY
Why’d you do that?

ASHLEY
I needed to hurt someone.

INT. ZETA KITCHEN - DAY 68

The girls do a post-quad wrap-up at the kitchen table as
Maria counts the money in the cash box.

TANYA
(to Harmony )
Brian Stone was all over you!

JOANNE
Hello -- how about Mona?
55.

MONA
(shrugging)
I got numbers from four boys. But
it was all for research. And
Joanne, I saw you trying to flirt
with that guy on the track team.

JOANNE
Well... Maybe a little. Do you
realize that today was the first
time we've been that close to
fraternity guys since those Sigma
Nu pledges broke in and pooped on
our couch?

Shelley walks in. The girls look up. Lilly wearing a large
hat and sunglasses hands Harmony a note.

HARMONY
(reading the note)
You're completely ingenious,
Shelley.

SHELLEY
Thanks, Lilly!

Lilly smiles then runs away.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(to Mona)
That's the same as vapid, right?

MONA
It's better.

69 INT. ZETA BATHROOM 69

All the girls are getting ready for the night. They are all
in front of the mirror putting on make up and helping each
other finish their hair. Checking out their clothes in the
mirror etc... Shelley enters dressed like she is going out to
a night club. Very short skirt, very tight shirt. All the
girls stop what they are doing and stare at her.

SHELLEY
How do I look?

TONYA
Heart stopping.

SHELLEY
That’s so nice thank you.

56.

TONYA
No literally. We’re going to visit
old people and your outfit might
kill them.

SHELLEY
Oh.

She turns and leaves as the girls continue on.

INT. OLD FOLKS' HOME - EVENING - LATER 70

Shelley enters the communal lobby where OLD FOLKS linger in
various states of boredom and narcolepsy. She sees Oliver.

SHELLEY
Oliver!

OLIVER
Hey! Shelley, right?

SHELLEY
Yup. I’m here to service the old
folks and I hope you don’t mind but
I brought a few other volunteers
with me.

Behind Shelley, the rest of the Zetas enter.

OLIVER
(smiling)
Wow, this is incredible!.

Francis, a man using a walker approaches.

FRANCIS
Ollie, who are these girls?

OLIVER
They’re new volunteers, Frank.

FRANCIS
Is that right? Well in that case
why doesn’t one of them volunteer
to get me some Viagra?

OLIVER
Francis...

The girls laugh. Francis rolls away. Shelley offers Oliver a
wad of cash.
71

57.

SHELLEY
Oh, and we brought this.

OLIVER
(baffled)
How much is this?.

SHELLEY
A lot. And we’re going to need a
lot to pay for the party these guys
are having tonight.

The deejay walks in along with the dance instructor. Harmony
is pointing out where they should set up. The older folks
look excited.

OLIVER
Well, they can't party too much
they’re pretty ancient.

SHELLEY
Oh, you'd be surprised at what an
old man can do.

Oliver smiles, having no idea what she's talking about.
Shelley smiles back. So does an older man with no pants on.

INT. OLD FOLKS' HOME - NIGHT - LATER 71

A DJ plays MUSIC. A disco ball now hangs from the ceiling.
The old folks shuffle around the lobby, salsa dancing as best
they can in their slippers, led by a short DANCE INSTRUCTOR.
The Zetas fill in as dance partners where needed.

DANCE INSTRUCTOR
Nice moves, Beatrice. That’s the
way to shake those fake hips,
Maynard.

Shelley stands off to the side, watching with Oliver. They
secretly check each other out. The music switches to a waltz.
Francis yells over to Oliver.

FRANCIS
What're you, a gay? Ask the girl to
dance.

SHELLEY
(hopeful )
I'd love to --
OLIVER
Are you sure? Because I have no
problem letting Francis think I'ma

She holds out her hands in a waltz position. He takes her in

his arms a bit awkwardly. They start waltzing.

Oliver and Shelley look into each others eyes.
proceeds to step on her foot.

SHELLEY
MOTHERFUCKER! !!!!

 

OLIVER
Sorry about that.

SHELLEY
( cheerful)
It's all good.

Then he

He doesn’t want to step on her foot again so he looks down at
his feet. As he does this he keeps mouthing “side, one,

two... side, one, two”. Maynard and Beatrice dance next to
them.
MAYNARD
Ask her out already, Oliver.
(to Shelley)
He's a good boy. You should like
him.
BEATRICE

(leering at him)
And he's got a high ass. Perfect
for the bedroom.

MAYNARD
Take it easy, Super Slut, before I
put you back in a coma.

They dance off. Oliver looks back at Shelley, a little

embarrassed.

OLIVER
I don't want you to think I cave to
peer pressure, but would you like
to go to dinner sometime?

SHELLEY
How about anytime.

Shelley and the girls eat cookie dough. Maria is bursting
with excitement for Shelley.

MARIA

He's taking you to dinner?

SHELLEY

I’m so freakin nervous. I haven't
been on a real date in nine years.

TONYA
What?!
SHELLEY
Hef didn't like us to date. We had
a curfew.
MONA
(appalled)
What, were you an indentured
servant?
SHELLEY
(confused)
No... these are my real teeth.

Besides Oliver isn’t like any guys
I know. He’s sweet and kind of shy.
A lot of guys at the Mansion would
just say what’s the delio and ask
if they could show me something
purple in the orgy room.

There is an awkward silence as the girls digest this bit of

TANYA
Speaking of orgies, how’s Colby
doing?

MARIA

Awesome. I think Shelley tricked
him into liking me. We hung out
three times this week.

SHELLEY
Did you do it with him yet.

She suggestively moves her eyebrows up and down.

MARIA
No! G-d -- I don't do -- that.
SHELLEY
(excited)

You're a virgin? That’s so cute. We
have to have an Aztec party. We
always wanted to have one at the
mansion, but we could never find a
virgin to sacrifice.

Off the girls' puzzled looks.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
And it will get us our thirty
pledges.

The girls all cheer.

A QUICK SERIES of mail popping into various computer screens
in dorm rooms, the library, computer labs, etc.

A female student opens the mail, it’s the Evite from the
Zetas. She clicks ‘play’, and on the COMPUTER SCREEN we see
the ZETA WEBSITE... We see graphics announcing the Aztec
Party with little dancing cartoon girls, each with a real
Zeta girl head on it, with Shelley prominently dancing in the
center... A banner scrolls across the top saying “come see a
real virgin get sacrificed”. A cartoon Maria is carried on to
the screen by some cartoon Aztecs. They hold her up while
another cartoon cuts her head off. The head falls to the
ground and says “See ya Friday” and The video ends, and we

EXT. ZETA BACK YARD - NIGHT 73

it.

EXT. ZETA BACK YARD - NIGHT 74

Maria, wearing a sexy animal-hide costume, is CARRIED through
the party on a platform by some hunky loin-clothed guys. She
waves to the crowd, happily. Joanne and Shelley walk up.

CUTE GUY
They’re really sacrificing her.

JOANNE
I think so.

CUTE GUY
Is that legal?

JOANNE
I’m not sure.

Maria's platform is carried to the top of the volcano.

MARIA

(into a wireless

microphone)
Welcome to Aztec Night -- the first
of many awesome Zeta parties to
come! And for all of you girls
going through Rush, remember to
make Zeta your number one choice!

The crowd CHEERS.

MARIA (CONT'D)
Now it’s time for this virgin to be
sacrificed in the boiling jello
lava.

Maria LEAPS into the jello volcano, causing the lava to ooze
out into a waiting baby pool. People rush to fill their cups.
Maria pretends to be burned and dies in a sexy but goofy way.
Two FRESHMAN GIRLS look around at the party, confused.

REDHEAD FRESHMAN GIRL
I thought everyone said Zeta was
lame.

BLONDE FRESHMAN GIRL
Not anymore.

Oh, my gosh! Really?

They hug each other delighted with girl joy.
EXT. PHI MU HOUSE - NIGHT 76

Ashley, Courtney and the Phi Mu Housemother stand on the
porch, watching the party at Zeta. A BANNER on the porch
reads "Phi Mu/Kappa Sig Mixer", but the Phi Mu house is

empty.

ASHLEY
They're over there, aren't they?
The Kappa Sigs?

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
Well, why don’t you figure out away
to get them back.

They all look at each other evilly until the housemother
farts.

EXT. ZETA BACK YARD - PARTY 77
Shelley and Maria walk up to some FRESHMAN GIRLS.

MARIA
(sotto to Shelley)
Find something in common, then zero
in on it.

SHELLEY
Got it.

MARIA
Hi. Are you girls thinking of
rushing Zeta?

BLONDE FRESHMAN GIRL
I wasn't planning on it, but after
tonight, I think I changed my mind.
64.

SHELLEY
I change my mind all the time! If
you're a Zeta, we can do it
together.
(to Maria)
With pudding!

Tanya passes by, thrown over the shoulder of one of the
loincloth guys. She calls out to Shelley and Maria.

TANYA
It’s my turn to get sacrificed. Who
would’‘ve thought being a virgin
would come in so handy!!!

The "native" slaps Tanya on the ass as they pass and moans in
goofy delight.

CROWD
Lava! Lava!

As the crowd chants The loin-clothed guy carries Tanya up the
ladder. As people go crazy, Mona notices Ashley and Courtney
approaching.

MONA
Hello, ladies. Can I help you?

ASHLEY
(scrambling)
We just wanted to see how our
fellow sisters the Zetas were
doing.

The crowd erupts in cheers as Tonya gets thrown high in the
air for a bellyflop sacrifice. The crowd goes ‘ooh’.

COURTNEY
Pretty big splash for a cabbage
patch doll.

Courtney laughs and holds up her hand for a hi-five. Mona
stares at her for a beat and then reaches over and grabs the
microphone that Maria had earlier. She turns it on.

MONA
(over the speakers)
Who wants another sacrifice?

The crowd goes crazy.
78

65.

MONA (CONT’D)
It doesn’t sound like you really
want it.

The crowd goes crazier.

MONA (CONT’D)
Are these two good enough?

She points to Ashley and Courtney who stand there
dumbfounded. The crowd goes insane. A group of guys rushes
over picks up the two squealing Phi-Mus and starts heading
towards the volcano.

MONA (CONT’D)
(yelling into the mic)
WAIT A MINUTE!!!

The entire crowd stops and looks at Mona. Dead silent.

MONA (CONT’D)
We can only sacrifice virgins. Now
I’m not sure about these two so I
think we should take a vote. Does
anyone here think either of these
two girls is a virgin?

The entire crowd yells “No Way” in unison.

MONA (CONT'D)
Yeah, me either. Dump ‘em.

The guys toss Ashley and Courtney into the baby pool as the
whole crowd laughs and points at them. The music kicks back
up and the party rages on.

INT. PHI MU HOUSE - NEXT DAY 78

Ashley and Courtney sit at the dining room table. Ashley is
eating M&M’s one at a time and looking like crap and Courtney
is holding an icebag on her breast. The housemother looks
impatient as she listens to them moan. The curtains are
closed and it is dark and cave like.

ASHLEY
I have never been so humiliated.

COURTNEY
Everybody laughed at us.
79

ASHLEY
I’ve never been laughed at before.

The housemother snaps.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
Well they’11 be laughing a lot
harder when those tramps get more
pledges than you.

She whips open the curtains and lets the sun in. The girls
react.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER (CONT'D)
You’re Phi-Mus for heavens sake.
Quit feeling sorry for your selves
and fight back. Those losers were
inches away from losing their house
and now they look like the queens
of the campus.

Ashley is so upset now she whips an M&M at Courtney’s other
tit. Courtney moans in pain ‘Owwwwww’.

INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT 79

Oliver and Shelley sit at a table for two. Shelley is dressed
a bit more conservatively than normal, but still sexy.

SHELLEY
(mid conversation)
..-And then it was humid so my hair
was bushy like Danny Devito’s
wife’s underarms.

Shelley thinks she has been rambling so she changes the
subject.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)

But I don’t want to bore you with
all that girly stuff. So let’s talk
about something else.

She smiles. Oliver is not what you would call a player so he
is a little awkward around Shelley’s none too hidden
sexuality.

OLIVER
Um, Okay. Who are you gonna vote
for?
67.

SHELLEY
I’m not sure yet. I just know I
won’t listen to what Simon says,
he’s so mean. I usually agree with
Paula and Randy.

Luckily the waiter walks up.

WAITER
Are we ready to order?

SHELLEY
(relieved)
Oh yes, Instead of the Mahi Mahi
can I just get one Mahi because I’m
not that hungry?

WAITER
Umm, I’1l ask.

Oliver looks at her puzzled then orders.

OLIVER
Chicken Marsala for me.

The waiter walks away. The two look at each other awkwardly.

SHELLEY
Who do think has more nose hair?
Donald Trump or Rosie O'Donnell?

OLIVER
Um, I don’t know.

SHELLEY
Yeah, me neither. Isn’t that weird?

Shelley thinks she's losing him so she tries her "in demand"
tactic.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
Well, I hope they don’t take too
long with our food, because I have
another date at ten.

OLIVER
Are you serious?

SHELLEY
What's a girl to do when she's in
demand?

Oliver frowns, less than impressed. Shelly gives a ‘what can
a hot girl like me do’ smile but has rye bread roll in her
front teeth.

EXT. CHI PSI HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT 80

The Zetas are hanging with some cute boys. Mona is playing
beer pong against a fraternity guy and winning. She sinks
another one. The guy drinks it and then starts swaying.

MONA
I think we’re going to have to cut
you off Ryan.

RYAN

No sweet Mona, I’m doing just fine.

MONA
Okay.

She winds up and serves a ping pong ball into the guys mouth.
He swallows it.

EXT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT 81
Shelley and Oliver wait at the valet stand.

OLIVER
So, have fun on your next date.

SHELLEY
Oh. I will. Thanks.

OLIVER
Alright, well good-night.

SHELLEY
Do you want my number?

OLIVER
It sounds like you’ve got a lot
goin' on. Maybe I'll just see you
at the nursing home sometime.

He walks off.

SHELLEY
(in baby talk voice)
Wait -- your biceps are huge! Kiss
me!

He gives her a weird look, waves goodbye and keeps going.
Shelley stands there, forlorn. The valet hands her the keys.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
(continuing)
I screwed up, didn't I?

VALET
Si. But I will kiss you with my man
tongue if that’s any consolation.

The valet sticks his tongue out and it has a tatoo of the
words MAN TONGUE on it. Shelley fakes like she’s getting a
cell phone call from her fake brother Steven Segal. The valet
puts his tongue back in.

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 82

The girls are all hanging out and they can’t wait to hear the
details. Shelley enters, bummed out about her date.

HARMONY
How'd it go, Shell?

SHELLEY
Not good. I don't think he likes
me. He didn’t even try to do it
with me in the mens room.

MONA
Why do you think he didn’t like
you?

SHELLEY

I could just tell. He didn’t fall
for any of my tricks.

MARIA
Maybe he’s one of those guys that
wants to have an intelligent
conversation with a girl before he
hooks up with her?

SHELLEY
What? No...... Really?.....
So I have to get smart? Can I even

do that?
All the girls give her encouraging looks.

INT. BOOKSTORE 83

Piles of textbooks on shelves and tables. Shelley emerges
with an armful of US magazines.

SHELLEY
I usually get all my world news
from US Magazine.

MARIA
How about you try this one.

She holds up an issue of ‘U.S. News and World Report’.

SHELLEY
Us news and world report? Does it
have celebrity pictures and gossip
from other countries, too?

Maria begrudgingly smiles and opens the paper to a picture of
a skinny starving African man with flies on him.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
Is that Chris Rock? He’s looking
totally manarexic.

Maria is baffled.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 84

Shelley sits next to Tonya in an architecture class. The
PROFESSOR flips through SLIDES of different buildings and
drones on. Shelley takes all this in as best she can. Paying
complete attention. Shelley looks to her left and now doesn’t
see Tonya. The camera pans down and we see Tonya curled up
asleep under Shelley’s chair like the adorable little person
she is. Shelley pets her and keeps on learning.

INT./EXT. ZETA HOUSE - DAY 85

Shelley is talking into Lilly’s closet. Lilly pokes her
scarf covered head out. Shelley leads her out across the
room and out onto the front yard. She looks peaceful and in
control. The two even start talking about English history.
From the other side of the yard, the mailman appears and
tries to hand her the mail. She freaks out and runs back
inside.

INT. MARIA’S ROOM - DAY 86

There is a chart on the wall that says “Intelligent
Conversation Topics”. It has headings that say, Literature,
Art, History, etc.. Shelley is sitting on the bed. Harmony is
sitting opposite her pretending to be Oliver(she is dressed
like a man and wearing a wig).

HARMONY AS OLIVER
So what did you do today, Shelley?

SHELLEY
Well Oliver, I was dripping hot wax
on my ta-tas so I could see my
tolerance for pain.

Maria gives her a dirty look. Shelley reads off of the note-
card in her hand.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
I mean watched the O’Reilly Factor.

Maria and Harmony give a ‘that’s better’ look.

INT. JOANNES ROOM - NIGHT 87

Joanne is standing in front of the mirror. She is holding a
cute tropical outfit up in front of her. She is wearing her
usual clothes that cover her brace. Shelley walks in and
stands behind her.

SHELLEY
That’s such a cute outfit.
JOANNE
Too bad I can never wear it.
SHELLEY
When do you get to take the brace
off?
JOANNE
Um, 2004.
SHELLEY
(excitedly)

Well it’s a good thing I asked!

JOANNE
I don’t want to take it off I’m
used to it.
88

72.

Joanne runs to her bed and gets under the covers quickly.
Shelly approaches her very motherly.

SHELLEY
You know Joanne, when I was little,
I wore a Scooby Doo mask to school
for a whole month because I thought
I was ugly. Every single day...
Then one day a boy, Howard
Rebenstock, snuck up from behind me
and just tore it off my face. And
do you know what I realized?

JOANNE
That you were pretty?

SHELLEY
No, that I’d been wearing it upside
down.

JOANNE
I’m not really sure what you're
trying to tell me.

SHELLEY
I don’t either but you’re a
butterfly now,not an earthworm! You
don’t need to hide anymore.

Joanne looks unsure.

EXT. ZETA LAWN 88

SHELLEY
He jogs by here around this time
every day. You like him. You want
to talk to him. Today is your day.
(noticing)
Here he comes.

The cute guy jogs by the house. Joanne just freezes.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
Come on Joanne, say something to
him. Spread your wings, butterfly.

Joanne goes to say something but she can’t.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
He’s getting away! You can do
this! You know why?

(MORE )
73.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
Because you’re a smart, beautiful,
confident woman. And no matter
what, I love you.

JOANNE

You do?
SHELLEY

One hundred and fifty percent.
JOANNE

You're the best Shelley. I love

you, too.

The girls look at each other sweetly. Then Joanne looks and
sees her guy has run past the house and is getting away.

SHELLEY
Go get him!

Joanne takes off running after her guy. We see her legs
going, faster and faster.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
Run Joanne, run!

And then, in SLOW MOTION, her brace starts to break into
pieces and fall off her body just like FORREST GUMP. Joanne
catches the guy and runs along side him.

JOANNE
Hi Steve.

STEVE
Hey Joanne. I didn’t know you ran.

JOANNE
I do now.

Back on the lawn, Shelley watches proudly. Then, her moment
of bliss is BROKEN by

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
You're pretty pleased with
yourself, aren’t you?

SHELLEY
What? Yes, I guess I am.
89

74.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
Well don’t get used to that
feeling, because there is no way
I’m going to let a whorey little
tart like you stand in the way of
the Phi Mu’s taking the Zeta house.

Shelley is shocked. Then, her gaze goes toward a birthmark
on the Phi Mu Housemother’s neck.

SHELLEY
What’s that thing on your neck?

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
It’s a mole!

SHELLEY
A mole? It looks more like a

pUppy-

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
You’ve been warned. Don’t mess
with me. Don’t mess with Phi Mu.

She walks off.
SHELLEY
Boy, someone needs a smoothie with
an extra vita boost.
INT. MARIA'S ROOM - DAY 89
Shelley, in a boxy cardigan, a denim knee-length skirt and

clogs looks in the mirror. She is wearing no makeup and her
hair is pulled back. She is dismayed.

SHELLEY
But, you can't even tell I have
boobs!

MARIA

Come on, you gave us alla
makeover, it’s our turn to give you
one. Nothing against your
previous... ‘boyfriends’, but
Oliver is the kind of guy that
wants a girl to look smart. Trust
me.

SHELLEY
I do trust you.
90

75.

MARIA
Your head is still too sexy. You
might need to wear my glasses.

Shelley takes them with a sigh.
MARIA (CONT'D)

It'll be good. Oliver is not the
type of guy that wants boobs over

brains.

SHELLEY
Okay, so I shouldn’t stand on my
head.

Maria laughs. So does Shelley but she doesn’t know why.

CUT TO:

INT. NURSING HOME - EVENING 90

As some girls read to the older folks, Harmony leads the
other old folks in a yoga class. Beatrice is trying to touch
her toes but can’t bend past her knees.

BEATRICE
When I was younger I could put my
feet behind my head.

MAYNARD
No one finds that surprising.

Francis sits talking to Shelley. We only see Shelly from
behind.

FRANCIS
I don’t know about all that but I
sure do sweat a lot at night.

Oliver walks by, hearing this.

OLIVER
What's going on?

Shelley turns around, wearing her frumpy outfit, eyes BULGING
through Maria's coke-bottle glasses.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Shelley?
91

76.

SHELLEY
Oh, hello Oliver. We're discussing
global warming. An area of
particular interest to me. Perhaps
if it's of interest to you, we
could go get a cup of coffee and
talk about it?

Oliver takes in the new Shelley.

OLIVER
Uh, yeah, I guess. Unless you've
got another date later.

SHELLEY
I'm free for the entire evening.
(to Francis)
Sorry Francis can we continue this
discussion later?

FRANCIS
Better be soon. I'm old.

Oliver checks out Shelley’s new outfit as they walk out.
INT. COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT 91

Shelley and Oliver drink their coffee. Shelley has taken off
Maria's glasses.

OLIVER
Well, I've never heard it put that
way, but you're right -- Kim Jong
Il is super mean.

SHELLEY
And there's some bad people in the
Middle East who are doing some bad
things, too, and I don’t think
that’s right.

OLIVER
Sounds like you've been reading the
paper.
Shelley nods.
SHELLEY

The girls have it delivered right
to the house. Every morning.
77.

OLIVER
You really click with those girls
don’t you?.

SHELLEY
They're my new family.

OLIVER
What happened to your old one?

SHELLEY
Unfortunately, they didn’t want me
around anymore.

OLIVER
Wow. That’s terrible.

Shelley thinks a moment.

SHELLEY
When I was little, one of my foster
moms had a coffee cup that said,
"Life is a shit sandwich, but you
don't have to take a bite." And
I've tried to live by those words
ever since.

OLIVER
Well -- I guess it works because
you're definitely the most upbeat
person I've ever met.

Shelley smiles at him, touched. It's the first time a man has
ever complimented her for anything but her looks.

SHELLEY
So, what did your mom's coffee cup
say?

OLIVER

I think it was, "Leave me alone.
I'm busy chain-smoking."

SHELLEY
Well, at least she had a hobby.

OLIVER
See? Upbeat.

The waiter comes over and starts clearing the table

WAITER
Would you care for any desert?
92

78.

He looks at Shelley and a light goes off in his head.

WAITER (CONT'D)

Wait a minute -- this is gonna
sound weird, but were you ever in
Playboy?

Oliver takes umbrage at this.

OLIVER
Whoa -- excuse me, pal. That’s a
little insulting. Are you calling
my date a bimbo?

Shelley looks at him, knowing now what he would think of her
if he knew the truth.

WAITER
No, of course not. I'm sorry,
ma'am. I was out of line.

SHELLEY
Oh, it's okay -- I'm sure whichever
-- "bimbo" -- was in that issue is
really pleased that you remember
her.

He leaves.

OLIVER
I should have popped that jerk.
Playboy. Gimme a break.

SHELLEY
Yeah, those girls are all boobs and
no brains. I like to think of
myself as all brains and medium
boobs.

Oliver smiles; Shelley forces a smile through her
disappointment.

CUT TO:
INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 92

Shelley enters, shutting the door behind her. Maria and the
other girls look over from the living room.

MARIA
(continuing)
So? What happened?
93

79.

HARMONY
Did you talk about the situation in
Sri Lanka?

MONA
Did you get to use "parsimonious"
in a sentence?

MARIA
Who cares? Did you guys do it?

SHELLEY
(defeated)
Uh, no.

MARIA
What? Why not?

SHELLEY
It just... isn’t going to work out.

MARIA
Oh, but I was hoping we could both
lose our virginity in the same
semester.

SHELLEY
(frozen smile)
Yeah...

INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - HEF'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 93

Hef sits on his bed eating ice cream out of the carton. All
of the curtains are closed. Holly, Bridget, Kendra and
Cassandra try to rouse him from his depression. Marvin brings
in a new carton and switches it out.

HOLLY
C’mon puffin. You’ve been in here
for days now.

KENDRA
Yeah, Hef. Let’s have movie night.
It'll cheer you up.

HEF
Why would she just leave?

CASSANDRA
It’s for the best. She wasn’t

happy.
80.

BRIDGET
Really?

HEF
How do you know? What did she tell
you?

Marvin looks terrified as he quickly exits. Cassandra lies
without missing a beat.

CASSANDRA
She never told me anything, but I
used to hear her crying in her room
late at night.

Hef shakes his head sadly at this.

HEF
I think I’d like to be alone for a
bit.

CASSANDRA
Sure, Hef.

The girls all get up slowly.

KENDRA
(bummed out)

I guess we can have another pillow
fight in my room.

BRIDGET
(equally bummed)
I’1ll go get the whipped cream.

The girls all exit, on the way out Cassandra shoots Marvin a
look.

HEF
Marvin, I'd like to do some editing
work on the website. Could you put
it up on my computer please?

MARVIN
Yes, sir.

Marvin heads for the computer room. He pauses, looks at Hef,
gets an idea, then exits to the computer room..
94

95

81.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM 94

It’s empty. Hef enters, sits and looks at the screen. He
gets a puzzled look on his face. We see THE SCREEN. Marvin
has put the ZETA WEBSITE up. Next to a banner that says
‘click here for our Aztec Party Photos’ is a cartoon body of
a girl with SHELLEY’S HEAD on it. Hef’s face brightens.

HEF
My Shelly?

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT EVENING 95
The girls are all gathered in the living room for Bid Night.

MARIA
Okay, guys. So like everybody on
campus wants to be a Zeta now. But
unfortunately we can only have
thirty. So let’s figure out who
they are going to be. Hit it
Carrie.

Carrie starts the slide show. The first girl comes up.
Cute blonde. Looks very new Zeta.
MARIA (CONT'D)
Kristin Withers. Pre-med.

Family from Greenwich. Everyone?

EVERYONE
Yeah, yeah, etc

Next slide. Another cute blonde.

MARIA
Jill Palmer, from Colorado.
Theater major. Father owns Coors.

EVERYONE
Yeah, yeah, etc.

Next slide. Dark haired girl. Still cute.

MARIA
Allison Jackson. English major.
From Florida. Has a Porsche.
Everyone met her right?

EVERYONE
Yeah, yeah. She’s good.
96

82.

HARMONY
Are you guys sure?

TANYA
What’s wrong?

HARMONY
Well, we’ve sort of achieved an
image here, and to be honest I
don’t know if this girl fits in.
She seemed kind of weird. She was
eating our cake with her fingers.

JOANNE
I saw her watching Iron Chef during
the party.

HARMONY
You see? Kind of socially awkward
and brunette.

EVERYONE
Yeah, yeah, dump her. Forget it.

The phone in the kitchen rings. Someone comes back and says
it’s for Shelley. Shelley exits.

INT. ZETA KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 96

Shelley picks up the phone.

SHELLEY
Hello?
HEF
Is this my darling Shelley?
SHELLEY
Hef?
HEF
Oh thank heavens. I’m so glad we
found you.
SHELLEY

I can’t believe I’m hearing your
voice. I’ve totally missed you and
I’m so sorry for whatever I did.

HEF
What you did?
83.

SHELLEY
Yeah. Marvin gave me the birthday
card you wrote...

97 INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 97
Next slide is a meeker girl with thick glasses.

MARIA
Katootoo Jihiman. Sociology. From
India. Everyone?

MONA
Could those glasses be any thicker?

CARRIE MAE
Yeah, and hair conditioner called,
it wants to know why you won’t use
it.

JOANNE
Not up to Zeta standards.

EVERYONE
No way. Nah. Next.

Lilly peaks her head out of her door.
Next slide. A little person. Looks good other than that.

MARIA
Jodi Taylor. Film school. New
Mexico. Everyone?

EVERYONE
(noticing Tonya)
She’s okay. I guess. Yeah, yeah.

TONYA
Hey, don’t look at me. I thought
she was weird. All she talked
about was Justin Timberlake and her
pet lizard.

EVERYONE
(relieved)
Phewwww, thanks. We agree....

LILLY
Look at you people! Is this really
what you have become?

(MORE )
98

84.

LILLY (CONT'D)
Judging other girls on their
appearance, calling them ‘weird’?
I’m sure glad I joined when I did
because I probably wouldn’t make
the cut these days. And neither
would a lot of you. I can’t believe
that Zeta has become just like Phi
Mu. A bunch of snooty bitches!

Lilly gets so self conscience that she finally spoke that she
bolts toward the window and dives out. Everyone stares at
each other. She was right about what she said. Silence.

INT. ZETA KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 98
Shelley on phone, much happier.

HEF
It was bad information you
received, Shelly, and to prove it
to you darling, I want you to be
the March centerfold.

Shelley’s eyes go wide.

SHELLEY
Oh my g-d! Hef, that is so
awesome. I can’t believe it!.

HEF
Believe it. And I want you to move
back to the Mansion. It’s just not
the same without you.

Shelley's smile is gigantic but she notices things around the
kitchen that remind her of her new family, a Zeta calendar on
the wall, pictures from the Aztec party and the nursing home
with Oliver in front are on the fridge. Hef keeps talking
but we don’t hear what he is saying anymore. Shelley is
having second thoughts.

SHELLEY
I’m so sorry Hef. I love you, but I
can’t do it. I just can’t. I’ve
started a new family and I’m gonna
stay here with them.

HEF
WHAAAATTTTT?2??!!!!!...
99

101

102

103

85.

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 99
The girls are still sitting in silence.

MARIA
Oh my G-D. What have we become?

MONA
It all started with this fake
blonde hair. And these stupid
water bras. We’re just a bunch of
clones. Completely interchangeable.

INT. ZETA KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 100

Shelley hangs up the phone and starts back to the living
room. Just as she reaches the door she hears Mona talking
and stops.

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM —- CONTINUOUS 101

MONA
This is all Shelley's fault.
Before she got here we were
individuals she’s turned us into
stupid bunnies. We’d be so much
better off if she had never came
into our lives.

INT. ZETA KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 102
Shelley. Shocked. Hurt. A tear.

She quickly runs back to her room unnoticed.

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM —- CONTINUOUS 103

MARIA
You’re right about us. But you are
wrong about Shelley. She is the
best thing that ever happened to
this place. She didn’t just change
our outward appearance. She
changed our attitudes. We can
throw parties now. Heck, I may
even have a boyfriend for the first
time in my life.

(MORE )
104

105

86.

MARIA (CONT'D)
And Mona, you no longer have a that
stupid bone going through your
nose.

Everyone agrees that is a good one. Lilly coming back in the
house.

LILLY
And she got me to talk.

Everyone agrees, happily.

JOANNE
And she freed me from my fears.

More agreement.

MONA
You’re right. I just think we need
to tone it down a little. Be more
of who we were.

EVERYONE
Yeah. Good idea.

MARIA
It will be the perfect mix. Half
Shelley. Half us.

TANYA
Where is Shelley, anyway?

HARMONY
In the kitchen. Hey Shelley!

She doesn’t answer. They all go to the kitchen.

INT. ZETA KITCHEN 104

Shelley is gone.

EXT. UCLA ROAD - NEXT DAY 105

Shelley sits in her car. Crying. Writing a letter. She
looks at the picture of Pooter hanging from her rearview
mirror.

SHELLEY
I can’t be myself with Oliver, and
I tried to turn the girls into
something they don’t want to be.
(MORE )
106

107

87.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
Well Pooter, I guess all I am is
just a dumb bunny.

EXT. NURSING HOME - LATER 106
Shelley's car pulls up. She gets out and approaches the front
door. She takes out an envelope, we see the name ‘Oliver’ on
it. She drops it through the mail slot and heads back to her
car and drives off.

INT. SHELLEY’S CAR 107

Shelley drives the windy Sunset Boulevard. Her cellphone
rings, she answers.

SHELLEY
Hello?

MARIA
Shelley, it’s Maria. Where are
you?

SHELLEY

I’m moving back to the mansion. Hef
called last night and said he
wanted me to be the March
centerfold.

MARIA
(trying to be happy)
Oh, wow. Congratulations. That’s

awesome.

SHELLEY
Yeah, it’s what I always wanted.
So....

MARIA

So good. Good. Great. All your
dreams are finally coming true.

SHELLEY
Yeah, I guess they are. You guys
have a great rush, I’m sure you’ll
get a million new pledges. Tell
everyone I said goodbye.

Shelley hangs up. Maria is confused, something doesn’t seem
right...
108

109

88.

INT. BEAUTY SCHOOL - DAY 108

MUSIC plays as a MONTAGE BEGINS. Joanne, Mona and Becky once
again have their heads in the sinks as stylists attend to
them. Harmony, Tanya and Carrie Mae are under the dryer.

CARRIE MAE
Well, whatever we're gonna be, we
need to figure it out. We still
need 30 girls by Oct. 15th, or we
can kiss it all goodbye.

HARMONY
When we show these girls who we
really are I don’t think we’1ll have
any problems. Right?

EXT. MANSION - DAY 109

Shelley pulls in to a hero’s welcome. She is almost enjoying
it. We see Cassandra walking down the driveway with Marvin
carrying her luggage.

INT. NURSING HOME - DAY 110

Oliver opens a letter. Its the one Shelley was writing. We
hear his voice reading it over the rest of the montage.

OLIVER
I am sorry I couldn’t tell you this
in person. It was way too
embarrassing to face you after all
we've been through. I’m leaving
the Zeta house to fulfill my life
long dream. And I know that it
won’t make any sense to you. I’m
going to work in the Peace Corps in
the mountains of Peru.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 111

Joanne and Carrie Mae, now brunette again, stand alongside
Mona who is still blonde, but with a more punk rock hairdo
and a defiant stripe of blue. They hand out ZETA LOLLIPOPS
while Harmony strums her guitar.
112

113

114

89.

EXT. MANSION 112

The cat jumps into Shelley’s arms. Shelley smiles and holds
the cat up to her face for a kiss. Then with an even bigger
smile on her face, walks over and places the cat inside the
dog fence. The dogs start chasing her all around.

EXT. ZETA FRONT YARD - DAY 113

Harmony, now make-up free, pokes holes in her water bra with
a steak knife and waters the rosebushes. Behind her, Maria
and Joanne hang a Rush banner that reads: "ZETA: BE WHO YOU
WANNA BE".

INT. NURSING HOME 114
Oliver finishes the letter. Looks confused.

MONTAGE ENDS

INT. SHELLEY'S ROOM MANSION - NIGHT 115
Shelley is ready for bed, talking to Marvin.

SHELLEY
.--. and that’s when I overheard the
girls talking about me. I thought
they’d be better off without me
so... here I am.

MARVIN
I don’t know Shelley, it sounds
like they were better off with you.

SHELLEY
I guess not. And you know what
really sucks is for the first time
in my life, I really felt like
people liked me for what I had to
say. I was even going to sign up
for some night classes next
semester so I could come up with
even smarter things to say to
people but I guess that would be
stupid now.

This hits Marvin.
90.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
Anyway, good night Marvin. It’s
great to talk to you again.

MARVIN
It sure is Shelly. Good night.

Marvin goes to exit, pausing at the door for a moment to look
at Shelley rolling over sadly to go to sleep. Then he exits.

EXT. ZETA FRONT YARD 116

Maria is holding court. The other Zetas are talking to
rushees on the lawn. They all have a confidence and
enthusiasm that wasn’t there before.

MARIA
Zeta was founded on the tenets of
sisterhood, friendship and
philanthropy. Since then we’ve
added kick ass parties to the list.

Joanne is talking to some girls by the front steps.

JOANNE
There really isn’t a Zeta type.
We’re open to all girls who are
looking for something different.
That’s why our rush theme is “Be
who you want to be”.

EAGER RUSHEE
Zeta's still totally my first
choice.

ANOTHER RUSHEE
Me, too.

Maria smiles.

EXT. CAMPUS QUAD 117
Lilly walks across the quad. She has all the pledge bids in
her hands. There must be about 100 of them.

INT. MAIL DISTRIBUTION CENTER 118
Lilly walks up to the counter. The clerk is on the phone,

shuffling through some papers. There is a cute guy standing
there who notices her.
gl.

TYLER
Hi. Are you new on campus? I don’t
think we’ve ever met. My name is
Cole.

Lilly puts the invites down on the counter and fixes her
hair.

LILLY
I just...transferred. My name is
Lilly.

Ashley walks in to drop off her bids. She sees Lilly is in
deep conversation. She sees Lilly’s envelopes. While the
clerk is still turned around, she acts quickly and slides
them into the nearby garbage can. The clerk finishes his
phone call. Ashley hands her invites to him.

ASHLEY
She just dropped these on the
floor. Can you send them out for
her?

CLERK
Sure thing.

Ashley exits. Lilly turns around. Notices the invites are
missing. Starts to freak.

LILLY
What happened to all those
invites??

CLERK
I got ‘em. Don’t worry.

LILLY
Pheww. You scared me.

INT. PLAYBOY MANSION 119

Shelley is looking at old party photos on the wall. She is
about to be part of history. She pauses at one for a beat
longer than the rest.

SHELLEY
(shaking her head)
Nah. No way.

The Playboy EDITOR appears behind her. He pulls out a chair
for her.
92.

EDITOR
(continuing)
So let's get started on your
centerfold interview.

Shelley sits. He smiles at her.

EDITOR (CONT'D)
Let’s start with ambitions.

SHELLEY
Well my ambition was to be a
centerfold.

EDITOR
So all your dreams have come true.

Shelley nods, halfheartedly.

SHELLEY
Yeah...I guess so.
EDITOR
Guilty pleasure?
SHELLEY
Eating cookie dough with my best
friend Maria... who secretly hates
me.
He takes notes.
EDITOR

We'll just change "who hates me" to
"in the nude".

He makes a note on his papers.

EDITOR (CONT'D)
Okay, hit me with your turn-ons.

SHELLEY
(wistful)
Someone who's kind and sweet to old
people. A bad dancer. And guys
whose first name begins with 0.

EDITOR
(sarcastic)
Wow. That's hot. Turn offs?

Shelley thinks for a moment.
120

121

93.

SHELLEY
Cauliflower, global warming, and
misogyny.

EDITOR

Let's just change "misogyny" to
“mean people”.

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM 120

It’s all decked out. Furniture moved to the sides of the
room. They are ready for the 100 girls to show up. Our
girls look really nice, and are just waiting around.

Mona walks in with a huge bowl.

MONA
This should be big enough to hold
everyone’s name.

HARMONY
I bet we're the first sorority to
pick their pledges by drawing names
out of a bowl.

MARIA
This way we don’t have to judge
people. The first 30 girls picked
get the bids.

JOANNE
All the girls are so nice. Maybe
I’1l move out so we can pick 31.

BECKY
I could move out or we might only
be able to pick 29.
LILLY
If there is a shy pledge, she can
have my closet.
Mona is looking out the front door.
MONA
Hey check this out.
EXT. ZETA STREET 121

All the rushees are piling into the other houses. No one is
coming to Zeta.
122

94.

Ashley and Courtney welcome their huge throng.

INT. ZETA LIVING ROOM 122

MARIA
What the hell?

HARMONY
Do you think everyone changed their
minds?

MONA
You did send out the invitations,
didn’t you Lilly?

LILLY
Absolutely.

FLASHBACK
QUICK CUTS
SHE TURNS AROUND
THE INVITES ARE GONE
THE CLERK NODS AND SMILES
SHE SEES ASHLEY EXITING
SHE SEES ASHLEY SMILING
TYLER HANDS HER HIS PHONE NUMBER
SHE SMILES AND PUTS IT IN HER PURSE
BACK TO SCENE
LILLY (CONT'D)
Guys...Ashley must have stolen
them. She was there when I was
there. And there was this boy
there. And I never talked to one
before. And I got his phone
number. And, and, and...
MONA
That bitch. Time for her to get

cut.

Mona opens her switchblade. Everyone is ready to kill.
123

124

95.

EXT. ZETA HOUSE 123

The girls burst out of the house and head for Phi Mu. Mona
is the first one there, getting in Ashley's face.

MONA
You couldn’t beat us so you had to
pull this crap.

ASHLEY
What?

There is general hub bub and name calling amongst the two
sororities finally the Phi Mu housemother steps in.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
Girls. Girls. Girls. Where is your
spirit of sisterhood? This should
be a great day. Inviting others to
join us as sisters for life.

CARRIE MAE
(pointing to Ashley)
She stole our bids.

ASHLEY
I don’t have any idea what you are
talking about.

PHI MU HOUSEMOTHER
Now, we had a deal. And it appears
that you have not fulfilled it. So
Monday Zeta will appear in front of
the Pan-Hellenic council to have
their charter revoked. If you have
any evidence of your charges
against Ashley you can present it
there.

The Zetas look devastated as they head back to their house.
The Phi-Mus wave goodbye and fake like they are wiping away
tears as they head back inside.

INT. PLAYBOY MANSION - LIBRARY 124

Shelley is getting ready to shoot her centerfold. She has
chosen the library as her setting. She is posing next to one
of the bookshelves with a cart full of books. She is not yet
nude but she is very skimpily dressed. There is a person with
a fog machine and a person with a wind machine. Everyone is
bustling around. Shelley looks distracted.
96.

PHOTOGRAPHER
We need more fog!

The guy cranks up the machine a little and a cloud of smoke
envelopes Shelley.

SHELLEY
(coughing)
Why would there be fog in a
library?

It’s sexy. Who knows maybe someone
is smoking.

Maria enters.

MARIA
Or maybe it’s because your butt is
smoking hot.

SHELLEY
(excited for the first
time)
Maria! What are you doing here?

They run to each other and hug. While Maria and Shelley are
talking, various hair, make-up people and clothing stylists
work on Shelley like a Nascar pit crew. Going as far as
flossing her teeth.

MARIA
I came to straighten out the mix up
about what you overheard the girls
saying about you.

SHELLEY
How do you know about that?
MARIA
Well, let’s just say a little bird

told me.

Maria looks to the door, Marvin is standing there smiling.
Maria looks back to Shelley.

SHELLEY
What bird?

Maria and Marvin react, Marvin walks over and stands right
next to Maria.

MARIA
Shelley, Marvin called me and said
you told him everything that
happened. It was alla
misunderstanding so I came right
over.

SHELLEY
But I heard what you guys said
about. Everyone thinks I ruined
Zeta. Mona said I turned you all
into a bunch of dumb bunnies. OUCH!

One of the pit crew has plucked an unwanted hair from
Shelley’s butt with a pair of tweezers and holds it up
proudly.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)
Could I have five minutes guys.

Everyone walks away as Shelley puts on a robe and leads Maria
to a different room.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 125

The girls enter the room which is adorned with old photos on
the wall.

MARIA
Mona was just talking about our
hair and the way we were dressing.
Maybe we did go a little to far.
But everybody loves you. For the
next ten minutes we all talked
about how you were the best thing
that ever happened to us. The
house just isn’t the same without
you.

Shelley’s eyes well up a bit at this news.

SHELLEY
Really?

MARIA
Of course. You’re the best
housemother any sorority has ever
seen.

They hug.
126

98.

SHELLEY
Oh my G-d, I have to thank Marvin.
And where’s that big bird, I’d like
to thank it, too.

MARIA
Shelley, forget about the -- I will
pass on your thanks to the bird.

SHELLEY
(breaking the hug)
So what happened with rush?

MARIA
Well, we had tons of girls
interested, but no one showed up
because Ashley stole our bids. We
have no proof but she did.

SHELLEY
So the house is gone?

MARIA
Yeah. We’re supposed to go in front
of the Pan-Hellenic council on
Monday to make it official but I
don’t think any of us are even
going to show up. We been
humiliated enough in our lives.

Shelley looks at the old PHOTOS on the wall of Hef and his
exploits throughout the years. She stops in front of the one
she was staring at before and pulls it off the wall.

SHELLEY
Maybe someone else does.

INT. PAN-HELLENIC COUNCIL MEETING 126

A large auditorium style classroom. It is filled with
sorority and fraternity types. There is a table at the front
with Ashley and a couple of other “Greek” leaders. There is
also a large screen and a projection system. Mrs. Hagstrom
and Mr. Walker, her fraternity counterpart, are obviously
running things.

MR. WALKER
So the new goal for fund-raising
next semester is two thousand
dollars per house.

(MORE )
99.

MR. WALKER (CONT'D)
Anyone coming in above that will be
honored in our yearly banquet. All
those in favor say aye.

EVERYONE
Aye.

On the big screen the group shot from the Zeta’s appears.

MRS. HAGSTROM
Now, our last order of business.
Unfortunately, not all of us will
be here next year.

Shelley and all the girls enter at the back of the
auditorium.

MRS. HAGSTROM (CONT’D)
For the fifth year in a row the
Zeta’s did not fulfill their rush
requirements so they will be de-
certified and their house put up
for sale. All those in favor
say.....

Shelley makes her way down the center aisle. Everyone hub-
bubs.

SHELLEY
Not so fast. I have one piece of
business that I think everyone will
want to see, before you get to your
piece.

MRS. HAGSTROM

Please Miss Darlington, you are not
a housemother anymore. You don’t
even have a house. This fine
institution of higher learning will
be much better off without a band
of misfits led by a wanna be porn
star. This institution is and
always will be hose bag free.

SHELLEY
I couldn’t have said it better
myself.

The crowd...huh, what? Carrie Mae gets the guy running the
projector in a headlock and Mona drops in the slide. It isa
picture of Hef from Woodstock. He is standing next to a very
muddy, very naked, very hairy hippy. On closer examination we
see that it is a young Mrs. Hagstrom and she is grabbing
Hef’s crotch. The crowd bursts into heated conversation.
100.

SHELLEY (CONT’D)

Are these the type of values we
would like to promote Mrs.
Hagstrom?

MRS. HAGSTROM
That is not me!

SHELLEY
Then I guess there must be two
people who have a freaky mole on
their neck that looks like a puppy.

Mona drops another slide in and we see that it is a close up
of the mole on the hippy’s neck. Mrs. Hagstrom covers her
neck and starts to stutter.

MRS. HAGSTROM

But... I mean... It was The
Sixties.
(she goes for the
projector)

You can’t blame me I was shrooming.

The hubbubs go crazy. Mr. Walker bangs a gavel on the table
to get everyone to calm down.

MR. WALKER
While this is without a doubt the
most interesting meeting I’ve been
to in a while, I think it is time
to resolve these issues and move
on. So here is how it is going to
work. We’re all going to start
over. Mrs. Hagstrom, you’re gonna
tone it down and act like a human
being again from now on with or
without the assistance of
mushrooms.

Mrs. Hagstrom nods in agreement.

MR. WALKER (CONT'D)

As for the girls of Phi-Mu, I wish
I could put you on probation for
being mean and nasty people but I
can’t so I will just tell you, try
to be less bitchy.

The girls are shocked.

MR. WALKER (CONT'D)
You heard me.
127

101.

He turns to the Zeta’s.

MR. WALKER (CONT'D)

And that brings us to the Zeta’s,
you’re going to keep your house,
your dignity, and your self esteem,
but maybe you could shave your legs
every once in a while?

The Zeta’s nod in agreement then celebrate, all gathering
around Shelley and hugging her.

MR. WALKER (CONT'D)
But next year you will get enough
pledges and meet all the other
requirements or we will be back
here.

MARIA
Yes sir!

Ashley walks over and angrily whispers to Mrs. Hagstrom.
ASHLEY
And you yelled at me for wearing
open toed shoes!

The Beer Pong Dude stands up.

BEER PONG DUDE
Can we get a copy of that picture?

MONA
It’s all yours.

Mona flings it out into the crowd.
BEER PONG DUDE
Great. I’m gonna post it on

www.need-a-trim.com.

Everyone laughs except Mrs. Hagstrom.

INT. ZETA HOUSE - DAY 127

The girls all enter the house. Everyone is celebrating their
victory.

MARIA
That was awesome Shelley. You saved
us again.
128

102.

SHELLEY
Hef and Marvin get a lot of the
credit, too.

MARIA
This is so great. Everything
worked out perfectly.

SHELLEY
Well, not perfectly. Real
perfection would be me and Oliver
together right now. But that can
never be cause I moved to Peru and
only left him a note.

TANYA
But you didn’t really move to Peru.

SHELLEY
I know that but he doesn’t.

Shelley walks towards the kitchen a little dejected.

INT. ZETA KITCHEN 128

As Shelley enters she sees Oliver standing under a banner
that says “Welcome Back from Peru Shelley”. He is holding a
bouquet of flowers. Shelley shyly walks over to him. All the
girls enter now.

SHELLEY
How did you know I was back from
Peru?

OLIVER

A little bird told me.

SHELLEY
I got to meet this freakin bird and
take him to dinner or something.

MARIA
Me. I’m the bird. I called Oliver
up the minute I found out you were
upset.

Shelley is touched. She puts her hands over her heart.

SHELLEY
(to Maria)
This is what it must feel like to
have a best friend.
(MORE )
103.

SHELLEY (CONT'D)
(to Oliver)
Now I have to admit something to
you. I didn’t go to Peru.

OLIVER
Get out of here.

Everyone in the room laughs.

SHELLEY
Also, I was in Playboy.

OLIVER
I know, Shelly. And I have
something to admit to you. I was
totally wrong about saying girls in
Playboy are bimbos. Because you
are the sweetest, funniest, most
caring and generous girl I’ve ever
met in my life, not to mention your
incredible brain and medium boobs.

SHELLEY
So... you’ll be my boyfriend?

OLIVER
Heck yeah. I mean how many guys
who manage a nursing home get to
say they have a Playmate Centerfold
for a girlfriend?

SHELLEY
Actually I left before we did the
photo shoot. But if you have a
camera I can be your personal
private centerfold.

OLIVER
(yelling)
Does anyone have a camera I can
borrow right now?!! I’1l give you
everything I own!!!!!!!!

Shelley laughs as Oliver pulls her in for a kiss. We see all
the girls peeking in at the kitchen door. Everyone oooohhhhs
and ahhhs. We hear a knock on the back door. The girls walk
into the kitchen.

MONA
Shelley, it’s for you.

Marvin enters the room, still shirtless, carrying a suitcase.
104.

SHELLEY
Marvin, what are you doing here?

MARVIN

I’ve been hired as the Zeta House’s
new butler. Since you'll be taking
classes next semester, you'll need
someone to help out around here.
Oh, and Hef wanted me to let you
know that the Zetas have a lifetime
pass into the mansion.

The girls all react, psyched.

SHELLEY
Marvin, I guess all I can say is...
welcome to my new family!

MARVIN
Ladies. I am at your disposal.

SHELLEY
Disposal. Right. I think the
garbage disposal is broken. After
you fix that we’ll take some
mangoritas on the front porch.

MARVIN
Not a problem.

All the girls come in for a group hug as we fade.
MUSIC AND CREDITS
UNDER CREDITS we see a rockin’ ZETA HOUSEPARTY including

SHELLEY, OLIVER AND ALL THE RESIDENTS OF THE NURSING HOME
partying with the Zetas and other students.
