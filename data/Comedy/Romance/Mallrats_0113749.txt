EXT. MONMOUTH COLLEGE (A BALCONY) - NIGHT

Through giass doors, we see the Governor's Ball
(banners delineating it as such) and a few weil-4
attired people. Exiting said glass doors is the. si
old GOVERNOR of New Jersey herself, accompanied by
SVENNING (local programmer of K-REL). The Governor is
by TWO SECRET SERVICE types -- their eyes darting abou
the surrounding area.

"But the Lodge oniy throws their bail

The Governor laughs and downs her drink. Svenning of

You know, did you ever stop to think
that maybe the relationship wasn't that

the infrastructure of a so-called

tenuous to begin with.

T.S. .
Why not? You know it's bound to come
up. ™~

BRODIE

It's impossible. Lois could never have
Superman's baby. Do you think her
fallopian tubes could handle his sperm?
I guarantee he blows a load like a
shotgun -- right through her back. And
what about her womb? Do you think it's
strong enough to carry his child?

They sit down and start eating their cookies.

T.S.
Sure, why not?

BRODIE
He's an alien, for Christ's sake. His
Kryptonian biological makeup is
enhanced by Earth's yellow sun. If
Lois gets a tan, the kid could kick
through her stomach. Only someone like
Wonder Woman has a strong enough uterus
to carry his kid. The only way he
could bang regular chicks is with a
Kryptonite condom, but that would kill
him.

T.S.
{looking at cookie)
What is it exactly?

BRODIE
(chewing, thinking)
Viscous sweetness. I can't really say
for sure.

T.S.
(chewing)
Tastes like cream.

BRODIE
Yeah, but it's not light enough to be
whipped cream, and it's definitely not
a parfait or something. I've made some
inquiries, but the staff maintains they
have no idea. Although they seem like
they're being evasive.

T.S.
Sometimes your abundance of free time
frightens me.

Bullshit. The eateries that operate

qualify as Food Court. Anything
outside of said designated square is
considered an autonomous unit for mid-

breaking us up. Why can't he keep his

nose out of our business and just let

us follow through with our plans?

     

BRODIE
You know, that's wnat I don't get --
why the hell do you want to get married
while you're still in college?

T.S.
I was just going to propose. The
wedding wouldn't be till after we
graduated.

BRODIE
Even so. Why get engaged? You're
young, for God's sake! A place like
college -- all that leg around campus --
you should be sowing your wild oats.

NS

T.S. ~
You don't spend the big bucks on a !
higher education just to rack up \
notches on your bed-post, Brodie. The-.
validity of coilege lies in obtaining \
a degree.

  
 

BRODIE
The idea of sex without worrying about
waking up your parents makes college 4
valid for me.
(looking 0.S.)
Now where the hell are these two going
in such a hurry?

vay and the further~bandaged Silent Bob rush into FRAME and dive
d Brodie and T.S. The Security Guard speeds into and out
of the FRAME in hot pursuit. Jay pops his head up.

 

JAY

BRODIE
Halfway to Kaybee by now.

The pair come out of their hiding spots. Silent Bob leans on
Jay for support.

Brodie hands Jay his Dixie cup and exits, followed by T.S. Jay
looks at Silent Sob. Silent Bob shrugs. Jay spots something
over Silent Bob's shoulder and reacts.

JAY
Shit! ‘Bye!

Jay darts away. Silent Bob glances behind himself, freaks, and
runs 0.S. The Security Guard chases after him.

INT. MALL ~ IN FRONT OF THE ELEVATOR - DAY

The Dude straightens Rene's jacket. She half-smiles at him,
then turns away, gazing off in another direction. He presses
the elevator button again, just as T.S,. steps up -~ his back to
Rene. T.S. is face-to-face with the Dude. The Dude looks at
him.

BRODIE
Are you nuts? That guy's pure

BRODIE

Shannon has already taken me to lunch
at the Cheese Haus, picked up tickets
to the opera for tonight, and brought
me shopping to stores I want to shop

BRODIE
I took you shopping every weekend!

You took me while you went shopping,

But you have to put that other arm

awkward type of position. You can
either lay on it, or hang it in the
lifeless, uncomfortable fashion between
your bodies. The only other option is -
to stretch it above your head. But my
arm pops out of the socket when I'm

I was constantly searching for

BRODIE

SHANNON
No, like somewhere girls dread.

Suddeniy realizing what he's talking about, Brodie goes wide-
eyed. He valiantly tries to take a swing at Shannon. He
misses, and Shannon slams him hard.

SHANNON
Is it because it's a challenge? Is it
because it's taboo? Is it because I
like to have them differently than
they've ever been had before? I don't
know.

BRODIE
This sounds like a discussion much more
suited to an extended professional
counseiing session. [I'll go get a
therapist for you..

Brodie moves to leave but is halted by a kick to the stomach.
He collapses to the ground.

SHANNON

The only one going to be needing a
doctor here is yourself, my friend.
Now my suggestion to you is to forget
you ever dated Rene. Until I get what
it is I'm looking for in this latesc

Brodie leans outside the rathroom door, holding his Dixie cup
and eating chocolate-covered pretzels. 1.5. emerges, tucking

BRODIE

Chocolate-covered pretzel?

T.S. takes the bag.

BRODIE
I just saw Svenning by the stage area.

T.S.
Think I shouid try to talk to him
again?

These are meiting.

 

BRODIE
Don't be such a critic.

T.S.
Maybe he's calmed down enough for me to
reason with him.

BRODIE
Reason, shmeason. You should go give
him shit.

T.
Are you ki I'm trying to marry

 

his daughter.

BRODIE
Alright, so you can’t scream at him.
What are you going to do instead?

T.S.
Kow-tow. Be a total sycophant. It
sickens me, but I have to win him over
if I expect to get her back.

BRODIE
There's a way you can kow-tow, yet
still spit in his face, so to speak.

T.S.
How's that?

BRODIE

I should de this alone. You do

BRODIE
Of course.
T.S.
(handing him bag)
Stay here.

T.S. walks briskly away. Brodie pulls a pretzel out of the bag
with his teeth and chews contemplatively. He sniffs his hand,
gets an idea, and then exits.

Svenning talks with two NETWORK EXECS.

SVENNING
I assure you, tonight's program will go
off without a hitch.

EXEC 1
I sincerely hope so, for your sake,
Jared. It took a whole lot of
convincing to get Bentley here to show
after that business the other night.

EXEC 2
If there's anything even remotely
resembling that kind of trouble, you
can prepare to be busy six nights a
week hosting the Lotto drawing on
Public Access for the rest of your
career.

SVENNING
(nervous twitter)
Oh... yes, well.. I can assure you
everything's under control here.

A loud CRASH is heard. The Execs shake their heads and walk
off. T.S. enters.

SVENNING
(to O.S. Execs)
Nothing to worry about. Just a sound
test. I'll see you back here around
show time.

T.S.
Mister Svenning. I was wondering if I
might have a word with you.

SVENNING
(glaring)
You're still here? I thought you'd be
gone already, trying to kill someone
else.
