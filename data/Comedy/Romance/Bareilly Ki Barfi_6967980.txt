MAN 1
Abbe kiski bike hai bey ye?

Vidrohi hears the honk and shouting coming from
behind and takes the paan, looking a bit nervous.

Chirag and Munna watch.

When Vidrohi turns, he is no longer nervous.

He walks towards the bike, putting paan in his mouth
and rubbing his fingers on his hair, staring at the

Then men stop honking.

Vidrohi sits on the bike, still staring at the men,
starts it and moves on.

MOTHER
Tum to sharbat hi loge.

Mother leaves, Chirag looks uncomfortable. Father is
having difficulty in turning his neck. He
uncomfortably turns towards Vidrohi.

FATHER
Aur beta dil behlaane ke liye

BITTI (CONT'D)
Aur mummy papa to flat ho gaye.

CHIRAG
Toh phir, aage ka kya socha

BITTI

Sochna kya hai, do hee baar toh

chandni raatein hongi. (Laughs
teasingly)

CHIRAG
Mujhse toh tum bahut baar mili

BITTI
Yahi ki tum mere bahut achche

Just then they see Munna and Vidrohi arrive on a
bike. Bitti turns to Chirag again.

BITTI (CONT'D)
Jitna tumne kiya hai na mere

aajkal.

Chirag smiles emotionally.

Munna and Vidrohi are walking and talking under their
breath.

MUNNA
Yaad rakh Vidrohi, aaj chapter
close karna hai.

VIDROHI
Ratta maar ke aaye hain bhaiya.
Tension mat leejiye.

Munna and Vidrohi walk up to them.

Vidrohi greets Bitti and Chirag in style and then
looks around.

VIDROHI (CONT'D)
Jaldi aa gaye.

CHIRAG
Aadha ghanta late hain Vidrohi

VIDROHI

Chirag babu, ye location raat

maja hai.

CHIRAG
Jitni sharab aap peete hain,

bachti hogi pait mein.

Bitti is watching their conversation.

VIDROHI

Bitti giggles. Chirag looks worried. Munna jumps in.

MUNNA
Bhoolne ki beemari bhi hai inko
(reminds Vidrohi) hain na!

Vidrohi turns towards Bitti.

VIDROHI
Arre haan, ek baat batana hi
bhool gaya. Main ek baar jail
bhi gaya hun.

Munna and Chirag are happy to hear this.

MUNNA
Hey Bhagwaan, jail...
criminal... ye toh bohot badi
baat hai.

BITTI
Arre koi badi baat nahi hai.
Krishna Ji to paida hi jail
mein huye thhe. Aur waise bhi
har baat yaad rakhni bhi nahi
chahiye.

VIDROHI
Kal agar aapko bhool gaye toh?

Chirag is looking at Bitti who is looking at Vidrohi.
Then to his surprise Bitti smiles.

BITTI
Itna aasaan nahi hai Bitti
Mishra ko bhool paana. Laga lo
sau sau ki. Aur kal tak toh
bilkul nahi bhool paayenge.

CHIRAG
(worried) Kal kya hai?

BITTI
Bhool gaye? Hamaari Lovely
Sweets ka golden jubilee

Vidrohi) Aur aap na aayein aisa

CHIRAG

Bitti and Vidrohi both ask.

BOTH
Kyon nahi aa paayenge?

Chirag turns to Bitti.

CHIRAG
Aaj raat ye waapas ja rahe hain

Chirag takes out a ticket and gives it to Vidrohi.
Vidrohi looks at the ticket.

VIDROHI
Haan waapas ja rahe hain.

CHIRAG
Toh phir kaise aayenge?

MUNNA
(rapid fire) Haan kaise
aayenge. Kyonki ye toh ja rahe
hain. Aane ka sawaal hee paida
nahi hota. Phir ye toh aane se

Bitti snatches the ticket from Vidrohi’s hand.

BITTI

Agar ye ticket phat gaya toh?
VIDROHI

Phaadiyega mat... nahi toh hum

aapse kabhi baat nahi karenge.
Vidrohi turns towards Chirag and Munna.

VIDROHI (CONT'D)

106.

CHIRAG
Haan.

MUNNA
Haan.

Bitti gives the ticket back to Vidrohi.

BITTI
Theek hai... jaaiye.

Chirag and Munna smile.

BITTI (CONT'D)

Lekin jaane se pehle mera
number delete kar deejiyega
kyonki main hundred percent kar

Bitti looks away. Chirag and Munna give each other a
quiet low five.

They look back and see that Vidrohi is looking
emotionally at Bitti.

CHIRAG
Vidrohi ji... nikla jaaye phir
ab, hain? Bag bhi uthaana hai,
dahi bhi khaana hai.

VIDROHI
Dekhiye dukhi mat hoiye Bitti
ji.
Bitti doesn’t say anything.

Chirag looks at Vidrohi getting emotional and looks
worried.

CHIRAG
Vidrohi ji, emotional hone ka
waqt nahi hai ye.

Vidrohi’s hand starts trembling, holding the ticket.

MUNNA
Badi mushkil se Vishnoi ji ko
bol ke saansad kote mein
confirm karwaaye hain.

Vidrohi’s hand shivers more. He holds the ticket with
other hand too, in a tearing position.

MUNNA & CHIRAG

Vidrohi tears the ticket. Chirag and Munna are
stunned.

Vidrohi tosses the torn pieces in air which go flying
in front of Chirag and Munna’s faces.

VIDROHI

Bitti smiles. Chirag shakes his head in disbelief.

CHIRAG

VIDROHI
Arre wahi jaanne ke liye toh

Munna bends down and goes near Vidrohi’s left ear.

MUNNA
Sorry.

Vidrohi hits his head with his left hand as if trying
to take water out of his left ear and points to his
right ear with his right hand.

VIDROHI
Idhar aake boliye. Is waale

Munna bends to his right ear.

MUNNA
Sorry.

VIDROHI

CHIRAG

Ab tum dil laga ke Rama mein

Chirag takes out a 500 rupee note and gives it to
Vidrohi.

CHIRAG (CONT'D)
Aur suno, achcha sa gift
khareed lena uske liye.

Just then Vidrohi’s mother enters the house. She sees
Vidrohi wet.

MOTHER

As Vidrohi finishes the proposal, there is an awkward
silence. Vidrohi keeps looking at Rama, Chirag looks
at Bitti. Bitti’s face drops and she turns her face
away. Rama looks uncomfortable.

RAMA
Vidrohi ji I’m sorry. Aap bohot
achhe hain, main pasand bhi
karti hun aapko. Lekin main ek
talaakshuda aadmi se shaadi
nahi kar sakti.

Vidrohi is taken aback, he looks at Munna and Chirag
who act clueless.

VIDROHI
Talaak? Mera? Arre meri toh aaj

Vidrohi looks at Chirag in disbelief, Chirag acts

BITTI
Yaar pehle mujhe farg padta
tha, par ab iss baat se koi
farq nahi padta ki unhone
kitaab likhi hai ya nahi,
letter likhe hain ya nahi. Ab
sirf ye maaine rakhta hai ki
Vidrohi ji aadmi bure nahi
hain, mujhe pyaar karte hain
aur main unke saath khush
rahoongi.

kamiyon ke bawajood bhi agar
Vidrohi ji ko main pasand hun

CHIRAG
Mujhe lagta hai ki tum

Aur kaise karte hain pyaar?

Munna looks sad too.

CHIRAG (CONT'D)
Dukh iss baat ka nahi hai munna

Haqeegat ye hai Chirag babu ki
Bitti humko pyaar karti hai...

Chirag keeps quiet.

VIDROHI (CONT'D)
Sab toh kar ke dekh liya tumne,
mujhe yahan bula ke, bandar ki
