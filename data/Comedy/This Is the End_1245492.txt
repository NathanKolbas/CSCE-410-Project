No problem, man. Have a great one!

Seth heads for the door, when something catches his eye:
JAY BARUCHEL eating with his manager WILLIE MERCER.

  
  
  

SETH (CONT'D)
Jay?!

Jay turns to see Seth, and has a slight “busted” 1

his face. He covers fast and puts ona smile. .j

    
  
   
 

JAY
Seth! Hey man! What’s going on?

Jay extends his arm for a hand shake.

SETH
Put that thing away!

JAY (CONT'D)
I got in last night, or technically late
the night before, but then I just slept
the next day, and prepped for my
audition.

Seth looks kind of hurt.

You're in town and you didn’t call me?

JAY
Oh no, dude! I was totally gonna call.

his eyes. Jay doesn’t notice.

JAY (CONT'D)
So... what do you want to do?

SETH
Same as always: smoke weed, play video
games. Only now, my video games are 3D,
and my weed is medicinally strong. You've
been in Canada for this whole
prescription weed revolution! I can walk
into a store and legally buy a joint and
a weed scone.

SETH (CONT'D)
And think about this: it’s designed for
people who are sick, so imagine how
fucked up it gets healthy people. The
answer: fuuuuuucked.

the Four Seasons, get some room service
and go to sleep.

Jay motions to the TV, still displaying news coverage of
the tsunami.
JAY (CONT'D)
And honestly, don’t you think it’s a
little insensitive to go out and party
right now?

SETH
You're right. We should probably fly to
Malaysia with a bucket and start bailing
people out. Come on! We’1l party in their
honor! We'll “drown” our sorrows! Get it?,

FRANCO

chance to own an original Wegner, you
don’t pass it up.

SETH
Oh, totally.

Jays rolls his eyes at Seth’s comments.

JAY
Yeah...they look super comfy.
FRANCO
They're not meant to be “comfy”. If you
sat on the Mona Lisa’s face it wouldn’t

be “comfy” either. You know why? ‘Cause
it's art.

He chugs back one, then another, then another. Then he
puts his head over the sink and dumps two more bottles
over his head.

Danny flips on a stove and starts making a huge

a few eggs on the ground, so he just grabs some more.

collection of books, scouring the shelves, on a mission.

- Jay looks through the library more, until he stops dead
in his tracks. His eyes go wide as he sees what he was
looking for. It is sandwiched between “The Koran” and
“The Bhagavad Gita”. Jay reaches out and grabs The Bible.

Hey! You big gangly demonic motherfucker!

Craig starts running across the yard, and the beast
SWOOPS down off the garage, landing a few yards in front
of him. The path to Franco's car is clear.

NOW!

Seth, Jay and Franco all sprint towards the g.

EXT.

LOS ANGELES - STREETS — CONTINUOUS

100.

Franco swerves down the hellish looking, mostly destroyed
streets of Los Angeles. Thick black smoke blankets the

city. It looks like hell on Earth.

FRANCO
But how come this is the first time
that’s happened in the last week?

JAY
Because I think it’s the first time a
of us actually did something truly
selfless.

FRANCO
I did let you guys stay at my,hous
I guess our Merciful Lordad 't see the

merit in that.

SETH
We can do this.

imple: we je find somewhere
xy to be nice to each
et sucked up to heaven.

   

 

JAY (CONT’D)
Seriously, they’ve got to have tons of
food and stuff in there, right?

FRANCO
Makes sense to me.

SETH
Alright, alright. Fine. Let’s do it. The
Four Seas—

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
  
 
101.

CRASH!!! Franco’s car gets violently T-BONED by a
speeding Winnebego! The guys are all thrown around the
car before it slams into a pole. They are dazed, but
okay.

THUNK! A pair of feet LAND on the hood of the car. The

guys scream as they see a CRAZED looking person SLAMMING
a club on their windshield. The side windows start to ge
SMASHED by other filthy lunatics with clubs. The guys
pulled from the car by what looks like a pack of cx.
post-apocalyptic cannibals. They have body-parts as
adornments (ear necklaces, shit like that) and
blood all over them. They throw the guys on th
and circle them, snapping their dirty, blood
cannibals are about to pounce when...

FRANCO SETH

DANNY (CONT'D)

I’m gonna eat you. Well, we're gonna eat
you. Because unlike you assholes... me
and my friends share.

JAY
You can’t eat us!

DANNY

Sure I can! I can eat whoever the fuck I
want. See, that’s the beauty of the new
life philosophy I adopted after I was
exiled from my homeland. I don’t give a
fuck about anything anymore. I eat
people, I butt-fuck this dude right here.

(Danny YANKS on the leash)
I do what I want when I want to whom I
want for as long as I want. I'm the king
of these crazy bastards. You see, I've

Alright. I’m gonna create a diversion,
ys use that alley to run to safety.

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 

SETH
you nuts? Danny’s gonna fucking

FRANCO

It’s okay. As long as...

(overly dramatic)

..-he doesn’t eat my friends too.

Gollt

Franco, in a heroic moment, SCREAMS an epic war cry. He
cks up a steel pipe from the ground and starts swinging
it wildly at the cannibals around him.

FRANCO (CONT'D)
SAVE YOURSELVES!!!

  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
   
103.

Seth and Jay scramble away as Franco attacks Danny’s men.
When they reach the alley, Seth and Jay stop and look
back at Franco, who has lost his weapon and is cornered
by the cannibals. As they are about to pounce on him,
Franco outstretches his arms and looks up to the heavens.

  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
  
 
  
 
  

FRANCO (CONT'D)
Take me Lord! I've sacrificed myself for
my friends! I’m ready for my Rapture!!!!

Danny and his guys look at each other, confused. Fran
cracks one of his eyes open and is disappointe
nothing has happened.

FRANCO (CONT'D)
What the fuck?!

DANNY
Well, well, Franco. Loo

Up the alley, J: ake one last look back and

in disgust and

TREETS - LATER

. SETH

I don’t know... Franco straight up
sacrificed himself to save us. That seems
pretty selfless to me. I was two seconds
away from trying the same thing.

JAY
Well... I guess unlike Craig, he was only
saving us to redeem himself. I guess he
actually thought he could fool God.

SETH
Well, he was a terrific actor.

They laugh.
104.

JAY
That's so fucked up.

SETH
Does anyone actually do anything purely
for other people? I mean, even religious
people who are charitable and shit only
act like that because they know they’11]
go to heaven if they do. That’s totally
self serving in the end.

JAY
So the only way to go to heaven is t
straight up do something you DON’T

somebody else happy, and you get ni
personal satisfaction from itwhatso

SETH
Yeah. I guess that’s th
way. But who’d be stupa
that?

They laugh. As they turn the cornér, they see the Four
Seasons. The hotel“has béen reduced to rubble.

 

(CONT'D)
Ha! Guess it 3 a good idea to stay at
é0's after all.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 

augh, then look into each other’s eyes;
i i are afraid. Seth

 

SETH
Listen Jay-

BOOM! The\ground shakes. Seth and Jay brace themselves.

 

JAY
What was that?

BOOM! The ground shakes again. Then, a LOUD AND EARTH
SHAKING ROAR emanates from above. Jay and Seth raise
their eyes up to the dark, smoke-filled skies to see in
its full horrific glory, a THOUSAND FOOT TALL, SEVEN
HEADED DRAGON.

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
    
  
 
 
 
   
 
105.

JAY (CONT'D)
“And out of the pit rose a great red
dragon, having seven heads and ten horns,
and seven crowns upon his heads. And
Satan was released unto the earth.”

 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
  
  
 
   

The Beast takes a GIANT step forwards, standing directly
in front of Jay and Seth. All seven heads turn their

attention towards our guys, fourteen eyes glowing red
with hellfire.

SETH
We're about to die.

Jay's mind is racing. He looks for a way o1
are utterly doomed.

JAY &
We are. We’re gonna die.

SETH
I feel like this is

Me too.

The Beast ROARS!

much as we’ve grown apart...I still love
you.

eth leans over to hug Jay, who hugs him back. One of the
Beast’s seven heads begins to plummet down towards Jay
and Seth, mouth open, ready to devour them. Suddenly, Jay
becomes AWASH in BLUE LIGHT!

JAY (CONT'D) a
What the fuck?

SETH
You did it! You redeemed yourself!!

Jay starts to lift up towards the sky.

SETH (CONT'D)
And I didn’t! Shit! Wait!

Jay reaches out his hand. Seth grabs it.

JAY
No you're not! I won’t leave you again!

Seth and Jay look at one another. Seth sees the genuine
concern Jay has for him. His eyes sadden for a moment,
then he steadies his resolve.

SETH
So long, Jay. Love you, man.

JAY

No...Don’t let go...you’ll die.
SETH

But you won't. -

Seth wriggles his hand free and lets go of Jay.
