“YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN"
FADE IN

EXT, FRANKENSTEIN CASTLE - NIGHT 1

A BOLT OF LIGHTNING..
A CRACK OF THUNDER!
On a distant, rainy hill, the old Frankenstein Castles as

“we knew and loved it, is illuminated by ANOTHER BOLT OF

LIGHINING,

MUSIC:' AN EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY begins to PLAY in
the b.g.

CREDITS BEGIN, as we MOVE SLOWLY CLOSER to the castle. It
is completely dark, except for one room -- a study in the

‘corner of the castle -~- lit only by candles.

Now we are just outside a rain-splattered window of the study.
The CREDITS END and we PASS THR GH THE WINDOW and SEE:

INT. STUDY ‘2

A closed coffin rests on a table. As the CAMERA SEMI-CIRCLES-
towards the front of the coffin... .

A clock, that weeRpens to cross our path, BEGINS TO CHIME:
"One," "Two," "Four..." We might notice that
both’ ite hands are e peiiting to'12.

Now we are FACING the front of the coffin and begin to -
RISE SLOWLY ABOVE it. "Five," "Six,” "Seven," "Eight..."

The heavily ENGRAVED LETTERS on the curved lid of the coffin
reveal themselves to,us, from bottom to top, inch by inch:

FRANKENSTEIN

We are AIMOST DIRECTLY OVER the coffin. "Nine," "Ten,"
"Eleven," "TWELVE!" :

The lid of the coffin FLINGS OPEN with.a CRASH.
cur TO:

THE EMBAIMED HEAD OF BEUFORT FRANKENSTEIN 3

Half of his face still clings to the waxen balm; the other
half has decayed to skull. Below his head is a skeleton,
whose bony fingers clutch a metal box..

A HAND ‘ 4
reaches in to grasp the metal box.

It lifts the box halfway out of the coffin -- the skeleton's
fingers rising, involuntarily, with the box.

Then, as if by force of will, the skeleton's fingers seem
to grab the:box back and place it where it was.

Now "The Hand" -- with the help of its other hand -- grabs
the box back from the skeleton's fingers...which no longer
resist.

ANGLE ON CORNELIUS WALDMAN 5

whose 'Hands' we have just seen, carries the box to a small
table. He takes a tiny key out trom his vest pocket and
begins to unlock the metal box.

NINE PEOPLE watch, him closely. They are seated on chairs
in the study, waiting to hear the contents of -

Beaufort Frankenstein's will. Their dress is turn-of-the-
century Transylvanian.

Cornelius Waldman fumbles with the ancient lock, emitting
little grunts as he tries to open it. As he is grunting,
tthe CAMERA PASSES the face of each "Potential Heir," as
he or she mutters in frustration or anger.

WALTER ~
My life is in that box and he
can't open it.

Cornelius Waldman finally opens the lock. He takes out an
old parchment, puts on his glasses, coughs and sputters a
few times, and then begins to read.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN
(reading)

‘I, Beaufort Frankenstein, in this
my eighty-third year of life, do
hereby declare the following
statements as my last will and
testament...to be read upon the
occasion of my one hundredth birthday.
And I direct my executor,
Cornelius Waldman, to assemble those
persons previously divulged to him,
that they may hear -- in my own voice --
the:..final disposition of my property.'

At the words “in my own voice" the nine "Potential Heirs"
exchange curious glances.

Cornelius Waldman nods to a clerk, HERR FALKSTEIN, who is
standing nearby.

HERR FALKSTEIN cranks an old Victrola and places the needle
onto an already spinning record. It SCRATCHES and then
begins to PLAY.

VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN
(deep and majestic)
The once proud name of Frankenstein
. has been dragged, by my only son,
Victor, into an abyss of shame.
There was a time when the name
*Frankénstein' conjured dreams of
virtue, of honor and devotion.
Now, no guilt, no malignity, no
misery can be found to equal mine.
And the catalogue of sins of my
once devoted son will not cease
to rankle in my wounds until death
shall close them forever -- so
supremely frightful is the effett
of any human endeavor to mock the
stupendous mechanism of the Creator
_ of the world.
(to an Assistant
Did you get all that? e@ you sure
you got ‘rankle in my wounds?! I'll
kill you if you screw this up. AlL
right, all right -- get the hell out
of the way. You're sure I'm close
enough to this thing? All right, .

If we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed: from

a skull, there's very little of the |
midbrain that we can actually see.

Herr Falkstein proceeds, almost on tiptoe, along the aisle --
his footsteps ECHOING lightly against the cold stone floor
as he passes the faces of students, intense with
concentration. He is carrying the small metal box from the
previous scene, oO

FREDDY
This so called 'brain stem'
consists of the midbrain, a
rounded protrusion called the pons,
and 8 stalk tapering downwards
calle e medulla oblongata,,.
which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum and becomes,
of course...the spinal cord. Which
brings us directly to the demonstration
prepared for today. Are there any
questions before we proceed?

I have one question, Dr. Frankenstein.

That's 'Fronkonsteen.'

I beg your pardon?

FREDDY
My name is pronounced
Fron ‘kon steen.

MEDICAL STUDENT
Oh! I thought it was
Dr. Frankenstein.

No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!

MEDICAL STUDENT
But you are the grandson of the
famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein??
+--who ingeniously dug up and
transformed dead components...

FREDDY .

(interrupting) :
I KNOW WHAT HE DID! I know what
he did. But I prefer, by far, to
be remembered for my own small
contributions to science, and
not because of my genetic
‘relationship to a famous...
Looney Tune.

Polite laughter from the Students.

FREDDY a
Now, if you don't mind, can
we get on to your question?

MEDICAL STUDENT
Well, sir...I'm not sure I
understand the distinction between
*Reflexive' and .'Voluntary' nerve
impulses.

- FREDDY :

~.Very good! Since our lab work today
is a demonstration of just that
distinction...Why don't we proceed?

Freddy motions to his Assistant, CARLSON, who wheels in a
PATIENT.

Freddy moves behind the Patient on the table.

Would you be kind enough to hop
up on your feet and stand beside
this table?

Mr. Hilltop gets off of the operating table and stands erect,

FREDDY
- Mr. Hilltop! Would you raise your
left knee, please!?_

Mr. Hilltop raises his left knee.

a FREDDY

. You have just witnessed a ‘Voluntary’
nerve impulse. It begins as a
‘stimulus from the cerebral cortex,
passes through the brain stem and
then to the particular muscles
involved. Mr. Hilltop, you may
lower “your knee. :

He lowers his knee.

FREDDY
'"Reflex' movements are those which
- are made independently of the will,
but are carried out atone pathways
-Which pass between the periphery
and the central nervous system.

You filthy, rotten, yellow
son-of-a-BITCH!

Freddy pokes his knee close to Mr. Hilltop's testicles.
Mr. Hilltop reacts accordingly. .

Le FREDDY

We are not aware of these impulses,
neither do we intend them to contract
our muscles. Yet™-- as you can see
--. they work by themselves.

By this time, Mr. Hilltop has lowered his protective thigh...
a little nervously.
. . FREDDY

But what if we block the nerve

impulse by simply applying local

pressure...which can be done with

any ordinary metal clamp.

Freddy reaches out his hand. Carlson hands him a bicycle
clamp. Freddy places the clamp behind Mr. Hilltop's ears.

: FREDDY

---Just at the swelling on the
posterior nerve root -- for, oh,
say, five or six seconds... :

A short pause. Freddy looks at his watch.

FREDDY
Why you mother-grabbing BASTARD!

Freddy jerks his knee into Mr. Hilltop's testicles. This
time Mr. Hilltop does not move. His eyes cross in exquisite
agony. He is almost ready to pass out. :

a “: FREDDY
- Because of this clamp, all
communication is shut off. In
spite of our mechanical magnificence,
if there is not this continuous
stream of motor impulses...

FREDDY
In conclusion, it should be noted...
(to Carlson)
Give him an extra dollar.

. - CARLSON
Yes, sir.
. FREDDY
-e-that more than common injury
to the nerve roots is always
serious, because...once a nerve
fibre is severed...there is no
way, in- Heaven or on earth, to
regenerate life back into-it.
Kre there any more re questions
before we leave?

Dector Fronkonsteen!

a piece of vermicelli in a glass
case until, by some extraordinary

Yes, sir.

He has a big mouth.

(to the Medical Students)
Yes! It seems to me I did read
something about that incident as
@ student. But you have to
remember that a worm -- with very
few exceptions -- is not a human
being.

A. small TITTER from the Students.
MEDICAL STUDENT

But wasn't that the whole basis of

your grandfather's work, sir...?
The reanimation of dead tissue?

FREDDY
My grandfather was a sick man.

MEDICAL STUDENT

But as a Franken...as a 'Fronkonsteen,!

aren't you the least bit curious
about it, Doctor? Doesn't the
bringing back to life what was
once dead -- hold any intrigue
for you?

FREDDY

You are talking about the nonsensical
ravings of a lunatic mind. Dead is

dead!

Herr Falkstein and Freddy are walking along the sidewalk.
In the distance, a little OLD VIOLINIST, wearing a Tyrolean
hat, PLAYS a cheerful tune on his violin. His open violin
case rests on the ground beside hin.

FREDDY
One hundred thousand dollars?

HERR FALKSTEIN
Oh, at least, sir. The land alone
is worth a small fortune.

FREDDY
But I can't just drop everything
