BUZZ McCALLISTER and ROD McCALLISTER are in Buzz’s room. Buzz
is packing his suitcase. He’s stocky and muscular, a jock with
a three-inch, waxed flattop. Rod is thin and lanky, dull and
bookish. Rod is looking at Buzz’s tarantula.

ROD
Who’s gonna feed your spider while
you’re gone?

BUZZ
He just ate a shitload of mice guts.
He’s good for a couple weeks.

Is it true that French babes don’t
shave their pits?

Who’s he?
BUZZ

Ever heard of the South Bend Shovel
Slayer?

ROD
No ...

BUZZ
That’s him. Back in ‘58, murdered
his whole family and half the people
- on his block with a snow shovel. Been
hiding out in our neighborhood ever
since.

ROD
If he’s the slayer... How come the
cops don’t arrest him?

BUZZ

They got no proof. But everybody
around here knows he did it. That’s
why he only comes out once a day.

To get his mail. His groceries and
everything else gets delivered. He
lives by himself. Never says a word
to anybody...

ROD
Wow...

BUZZ
I keep watchin’ that show...
"America’s Most Wanted." I know he’s
gonna be on it someday. Then I’m
gonna call that 900 number. Turn his
ass into’ the authorities. Make a

HIS Pov

Moving from one side to the other, past the accumulated rubbish
of a couple of generations. Boxes, old furnishings, lamps,
discarded toys, a huge, old boiler with wrapped pipes that look
like tentacles reaching into the floor and the house above,

a pair of naked store mannequins , a work bench loaded with old
tools, jars of nails and paint cans and finally, a collection
of a dozen, old, tattered, marionettes hanging from the rafters
by their strings. It’s an altogether unsettling place for a

lonely, young boy.
