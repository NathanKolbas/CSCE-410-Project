FADE IN:

EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT |

The CAMERA LOOKS DOWN ON the village, nestled in the I
valley below. Simple wood-framed houses. Smoking i
chimneys. Lighted windows. The night is chilly, thick,

spooky. The DOGS of the village are heard BARKING and :
HOWLING, upset by something that they understand, even |
if we don't. i

LETTERS READ... "Salem, Massachusetts. 1692."

Under a full moon a spooky-looking high-eaved little
house glowers down at the village from the top of a hill.
‘Smoke rises up out of its chimney, twisting and turning
in a very unnatural fashion. This is no ordinary smoke,
and this is no ordinary house.

The CAMERA FINDS something moving through the bushes just
below the house and FOLLOWS the source of the motion.
Suddenly, the shivering bushes part, and two heads
appear. They belong to a pair of local farm children,
THACKERY and ELIJAH BINX. Thackery, thirteen, is the
older. Elijah, his brether, is ten. Both wear homespun,
simple clothing. They peer up at the house, frightened.

 

THACKERY
They conjure. Look!

He points at the chimney smoke in which the shapes of
little demons and beasts can be seen forming and unform-
ing in the vapors. Elijah is really scared. Thackery
starts crawling toward the house.

ELIJAH
Thackery!

But he follows him...

CAMERA FOLLOWS the two children, as they crawl through
the bramble-filled yard toward the lighted windows of the
spooky-looking house. They reach the window and peer in.

THEIR POV

The main room of the house is lit only by the fire in the
broad hearth and by candles placed in a circle around the
room. ‘The CAULDRON BOILS on the fire as the three
Sanderson sisters, WINIFRED, MARY, and SARAH stand around
it. Very old, and dressed in the heavy black woolen
clothing of the era, they look like exactly what they
are... witches.

Winifred is the eldest and by far the most powerful.

CONTINUED:

Once beautiful, her beauty has been corrupted by evil
(her fingers have grown talons, her teeth have
sharpened), but she is still vain, and she hates
children for their youth and prettiness.

Winifred has a nasty temper; when she gets really angry,
her -hair stands on end, and she possesses an ability to
discharge jolts of electrical energy. Winifred has great
aril? with potions and spells. She is a very dangerous
witch.

Mary, the middle sister, is obese and gluttonous.
Obsessed with food, she possesses the outward manner of a
sweet as sugar kindly aunt. Mary loves little children.
She loves them because she loves to eat them. Mary's
sense of smell is incredibly keen; she can follow the
scent of a child like a bloodhound.

Sarah, the youngest, is the idiot sister. She's also
beautiful and sexy. She likes to torture things: small
animals, children, bugs, you name it. Any suggestion of
cruelty (to somebody else) sends her into a fit of idiotic
cackling laughter, while any fear for herself sends her
into a fit of terrified screaming. She's a mess.

The children watch as Winifred reads from the recipe in
her ancient spell book.

WINIFRED
(reading)
Oil of boil...
(puts in a drop)
And a dead man's toe...

Drops one in. Suddenly, Sarah's nose catches a whiff of
something. She sniffs.

SARAH
I smell...
(licks her lips)
Children.

BACK TO SCENE

Thackery and Elijah duck for cover as Sarah, Winifred,
and Mary step up to the window and gaze out.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE

Thackery and Elijah hide right below them, motionless,
as Sarah sniffs and Winifred's evil eyes scan the
darkness for their favorite prey... children.

(CONTINUED )
 

CONTINUED:

Suddenly, a ghostly white form can be seen approaching
through the darkness.

WINIFRED
Sisters, our guest is here.

The witches share an evil laugh of pleasure and move back
into the room. The kids are terrified, as the white form
approaches and becomes identifiable as... a LITTLE GIRL
dressed in a long white night shirt.

ELIJAH
(in a whisper)
'Tis our sister, Emily!

The Little Girl's eyes are closed. She is walking in her
sleep.

THACKERY
(in a whisper)
Emily... Emily!

But she walks right past them and into the house.

ELIJAH
She is. bewitched!
THACKERY
Run to town. Fetch the elders.
ELIJAH
But --
THACKERY

Go, Elijah. Run like the wind.
Elijah crawls away, then gets to his feet and sprints
off down the hill toward the village.
BACK IN HOUSE - MOMENT LATER

Emily sits on a stool next to the bubbling cauldron.
Winifred continues reading from her spell book.

WINIFRED

'Finally when 'tis nearly done,
Add a bit of thy own tongue...

CLOSE ON WINIFRED

as she bites her own tongue, then spits into the
cauldron.

 
 

   

CLOSE ON CAULDRON

as it bubbles up, changing to a dark sickly purple color
and giving off a menacing curl of vapor. ’

WINIFRED
'Tis ready for tasting.

Mary is about to take a taste, but Winifred gives her a
painful backhand, knocking her away from it. She dips a

. Spoon into the potion, then holds the steaming spoon out

to Emily.

WINIFRED
One drop of this, and her life
will be mine.

The witches cackle. The entranced little girl opens her
mouth wide as Winifred leans in with the spoon. But
suddenly the door to the house flies open, and Thackery
races in.

SARAH
A boy!

Thackery flings a stool at Winifred; she jumps clear,
flicking the contents of the spoon on Mary, whom it
SIZZLES. . Thackery grabs a long iron pot hook off the
wall. He swings it at the witches, who recoil from
him. Winifred snatches up her spell book and holds it
protectively.

WINIFRED
Get him, you fools!

MARY
Get him, you fool!

Mary shoves Sarah at Thackery, and Thackery gives her a
good bop on the head.»

As Winifred, getting furious, starts gathering power for
a major electrical discharge, Thackery hooks the edge of
the cauldron with the pot hook and dumps it over. The
BUBBLING GOO spills all over the dirt floor.

ON WINIFRED

as she shrieks in rage at the sight of her ruined potion.
Her hair is now standing out straight in the air.

Thackery bolts for the door, but Winifred nails him with
a massive jolt of electricity and he goes down.

 
 

THACKERY'S POV - FROM FLOOR - MOMENT LATER

CC as he comes to and sees the witches' three ugly faces
Nd staring DOWN AT him.

BACK TO SCENE
Thackery tries to struggle, but they've tied him up.

MARY
See how bravely he struggles.

They cackle.

WINIFRED
What shall we do with him,
sisters?

MARY
Roast him with potatoes!

SARAH
Put hornets in his ears!

WINIFRED
No no, he's such a brave little
~ boy, -his punishment must be more
co ... inventive... Let's find
something in my book.

She pets the book.

SARAH
The book! The book!

Sarah and Mary cackle with glee as Winifred lovingly
opens and peruses her spell book.

: WINIFRED
Let me see... Warts... Itching...
Crib death --

MARY

WINIFRED

not be to die, but to live

Winifred reads from the book.

WINIFRED
Twist the bones and bend the back;
Trim him of his baby fat.

And pointy claws with which to spat!

Winifred hisses at him.

THACKERY'S POV OF WITCHES

EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - NIGHT

The witches are set to be hanged over a pyre.
Elijah stand with their FATHER.

FATHER BINX
Confess your crimes. Where be the

MARY

SARAH

WITCHES SHRIEK WITH LAUGHTER. But their shrieking is
suddenly cut short, as we hear the PLANK TUMBLE to
the ground.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Nearby, something small and sad watches from the bushes.

Watery marble eyes blink slowly. When they open, they're
looking up at...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Among. the students in the classroom are ALLISON

WILLIAMSON (15, prettiest girl in town) and BEN and ALAN
(14, town's geeky outcasts).

A witch-like face:
MISS OLIN
Could anyone explain for us how
the cultural significance of
Halloween and our own local
history might perhaps share some
common ground?

A tarantula secretly crawls among the feet of the
students. It crawls towards Allison's feet. Ben knows
about it, so Alan diverts the class.

MISS OLIN
Yes... Mr. Schotznick?

ALAN
Thank you. Halloween, or more
properly, Allhallows Eve, in
medieval times was a holy evening.
It took place on October 3lst, the
eve of All Saints Day when the
souls of the dead rose and walked
the Earth again.

most diabolical ancestors vowed to
do on this very night.

The Sanderson sisters, before
being hanged by a town full of
most righteous and, if you ask me,
most improperly dumped- on witch
hunters, swore they'd come back
to avenge themselves on Salem's
children... that would be us.

(beat)
There are those to this day, Mr.
Corwin. and myself included, who
believe that every Halloween night
a black cat still guards the old
Sanderson house, warning off any
who might bring the witches back
from the grave.

ALLISON
Ahhhhh!

The tarantula's on Allison's foot. She flips it away.
It lands..on its back -- legs wrigglin' -- exposing its
electronic innards. The BELL RINGS. The class exits.

' Allison glares at Ben. He shrugs, points to Max. She

looks at him. He smiles, gratefully. But, shaking her
head, she leaves. Max's crest falls.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROW -- DAY

Ben and Alan's lockers are altars to superstitious
protectives. Max collects his stuff from his locker
nearby. He can't stop looking at Allison down the hall.
Ben consults his."locker-rolodex."

BEN

'A' student. Took over finest
babe throne from Christi Klipenger

MAX
Yeah, now that you guys made me
look like such an idiot!

ALAN
You should thank us for breaking
the ice for you.

MAK
With an R.C. tarantula? Now she
thinks I'm a geek!

BEN
No, now she thinks you're a clever
geek. Big difference.

MAK
Don't do me anymore favors, okay?
I can break my own ice.

Max starts after Allison. Turns back, heads out of
school past Ben and Alan:

BEN
Good call, Max! It's Friday the

-l3th,.Halloween and a full moon

all at once! Unluckiest day of
the current millennium!

ALAN
Prediction.
BEN
Predict on.
ALAN
Our young apprentice shall crash

BEN

Agreement. The night grows near.
We must prepare.

ALAN

They finger "garlic butter" on their faces as war paint.

They head

off -- parting gagging students in the hallway

like corpses.

What? Sorry. I wasn't staring.

ALLISON
That's not what I meant, but since
you mentioned it, ever since you
started at Cromwell High you"ve
been staring at me. Is there
something wrong with you?

MAX
What?! No, I mean, ya know, no.
I guess I can't help myself.

‘ ALLISON

Oh. You're just immature. I
should've guessed with the spider
in social studies.

EXT. SALEM STREET

Max rides out of the mall under an anvil of teenage
angst, looking back at Allison getting into her mom's
car. Wham! He runs into JAY and ERNIE (17, town jerks
emeritus -- an Axl Rose apostle and a white rap fanatic),
on their moto-cross bikes. Their bags of Halloween prank
supplies scatter.

MAX
Oh man! Jay, Ernie, man, I'm
sorry!

Ernie yanks Max off his bike. Sticks his head in Max's
face. The word I C E! is shaved into his short hair.

ERNIE
Can't you read?! My name is Ice!
Cold-hearted like a cube. Get it!
Huh?! Ice! Get it?!

MAX
Yeah, I get it, I'm sorry.

Max is about to protest, Ernie unpockets a knife. Max
loses the shoes. Ernie tries 'em on. Too small. He
slices the heels out.

ERNIE
Perfect. Here, trade man, don't
say I never gave you nothin’.

Ernie stuffs his crusty tennies in Max's arms.

ERNIE
If you tell anyone you saw us --

Ernie and Jay take off for the top of the mountain.

EXT. MOUNTAIN BIKE PARK - OUTSIDE TOWN - DAY

A ski resort that's a mountain bike park in the off-
season. Max rides by an old cemetery and up to the
ticket booth with purpose. He takes the ski lift.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - "SUICIDE GORGE” - DAY

Max suits up: helmet, gloves, pads. Rides to the edge
of the expert run -- vertical deathtrap; rocks, moguls...
Max breathes deep. Cinches down his toe straps. Death-
grip on bars. Is just about to pedal over the edge,
when...

... he chokes. Frustrated, he backs away from the edge
just as Ernie and Jay fly by him -- jetting down the run.
Their bikes are agile horses. Max rides off, at once
scared and disappointed.

INT. MAX'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

Max rifles through the CDs. Oh no, Neil Diamond. Oh
yes, "SOLITARY MAN." As the lachrymose lyrics lilt
through his private teenage cave (Bud Light babe posters,
et al...), Max goes eye to advisorly eye with a poster
of his big time hero:

NEIL DIAMOND (V.0.)
‘A solitary man... That's what I am,

But, I mean look --

Max shows the pic of Allison to the pic of Neil:

MAX
See? Am I lyin'? Is she
beautiful or what?

Max is suddenly entranced by the picture. He brings it
up to his face. He's gonna kiss it! Suddenly, his
little sister, DANI, appears behind him from the closet.

Boo!

MAX
Abh!

DANI

Thieves!

Dani struggles with her 1/2 ton of candy. At a cross
street, Max turns back:

MAX
What did you want me to do? There
were two of them!

DANI
You didn't have to roll over
completely!

MAK

I didn't wanna take you trick or
treating, but I did. And if I
didn't give him my Swatch he
would've beat the crap out of both
of us. I saved your butt! So just
collect your candy and shut the
hell:up, Dani!

DANI

I'm telling Mom and Dad that
you ruined my Halloween!!

Go ahead. See if I care.
DANI
You don't care about anything,

MAX

I got nothing to care about.
Dani sits on the curb, bawling. Max sits with her.

Max splits a chocolate bar with his little sister.

A full moon hangs over the Sanderson house far away.

DANI.
I think full moons are good luck.

The old Sanderson house looms at the top of the hill, as
Max, Allison, and Dani climb the hillside in the ghostly
moonlight. Max leads the way. It's very spooky.

DANI

They found the bones of a hundred
children buried in this hillside.

Something bolts by Max's feet -- he leaps four feet:

MAx

DANI
Oh yeah, big man.

The black CAT sits 'twixt the gang and the house. Its
eyes shine in the dark. It "MEOWS," strangely.

DANI

The CAT "MEEOOOWWSS."
Max chucks a stone at the kitty. WHAP! It disappears.

The displays are cobwebbed. Rainwater catch-buckets.
Velvet ropes form a guided tour past display signs,
potions, strange devices, dried animals and the
cauldron. The gang. screams.

ALLISON
Oh my God, I forgot about those.

Wax witch effigies wearing talisman necklaces. They're
huddled o'er the cauldron. Max ventures forward. Dani
clings to his arm -- he wrenches free.

MAX
'The spellbook of Winifred
Sanderson. Given to her by the
Devil himself. Bound in human
skin, it contains the recipes for
spells of destruction and life.'
Human skin, right.

ALLISON
Unless you believe in this stuff,
it seems goofy.

Max feels his oats here, he ain't afraid of nothin'.

MAX
Definitely. Check this out.
The black candle display. A box of old matches nearby.

MAX
"The Candle of the Black Flame.
Made from the tallow of a still
born calf -- gross -- and the fat
of a hanged man -- no way -- This
candle was used by --

That's what she meant!

Meant who what?

ALLISON
Before they hanged her, Winifred
Sanderson cast one last spell, ‘One
Halloween night when the moon is
“round, a virgin will summon us from
the ground...’

In the b.g., through the window, the clouds drift away,
revealing the full round moon. The room is suddenly
illuminated with moonlight. It's very spooky. Allison
and Dani are afraid.

MAX
Cool. Let's light the thing and
meet the hags.
(offering Alison his
lighter)
Would you like to do the honors?

ALLISON
We shouldn't be fooling around
with this.

DANI

No kidding!

MAX
What are you afraid of? It's all
just a bunch of hocus pocus.

Suddenly, with a PANTHER- LIKE YOWL, the BLACK CAT leaps
out of the darkness and lands on Max's back. For a moment
it hangs on, clawing him viciously.

MAX
(freaked)
Get him off! Get him off me!

Ahhhhh!

As suddenly as it attacked, the cat drops off of Max and
disappears into the shadows. Allison nervously laughs at
Max's freaked out state. Max, embarrassed, picks up a
piece of firewood, and brandishes it like a weapon.

MAX

Stupid cat!

hitting him with a rock -- Oh my
God, I can hear him now, too!

MAX
What?

ALLISON
He talks!

DANI
I told you!

More YOWLING from the shadows.

ALLISON
He says if we don't get out of
here right now, we'll never get
out!

MAX
So why can't I hear him?

More YOWLING.

DANI
Only those who believe in magic
can hear him speak!

MAK
You guys are overreacting!

ALLISON
Let's get out of here!

Allison helps him look. The CAT MEOWS at them
menacingly.

MAX
Shut up, Morris!

Sneezes. The moon slips behind the clouds again,
darkening the room. Max flicks his lighter lit.

 

ALLISON
I can't see a thing! Let's just
‘ split!

Max looks at the black flame candle. Without thinking,
he lights it. Dani sees him.

DANI
Max! No!
The CAT YOWLS in horror, But it's too late...

CLOSE ON CANDLE

as Max's lighter ignites the flame, but instead of giving
off light, the flame literally sucks in the light around
it, like a black hole.

ON MAX'S REACTION
as he realizes he's just made the blunder of his life.

MAX
Uh-oh.

But it's too late. With a sudden IMPLOSION/EXPLOSION,
all the light in the room is sucked into the candle,
while at the same time a strange HOWLING WIND emanates
out of the flame and blows around the room. Hellish
LAUGHTER and SCREAMING are heard as the WIND GUSTS,
blowing around dust and objects...

CAT

Light erupts from the ground, carrying the buried ashes

The light 'n' ashes stream up into the wax dummies --
lighting them from the inside out. Melting the wax...

CAT
No no no...

The EFFIGIES MOAN like the undead. Wax drops off them in
luminous. thick lugies. The PLASTER EXPLODES from the
mannequins! Waxy plaster dust fills the room. Moonlight
filtered in the trillion particles clears slowly. The |
kids duck behind the spellbook display. They stare and
shudder at what has impossibly manifest before them:

SANDERSON SISTERS

skinny, fat and ugly. Unchanged and pissed. They are
slow to realize their good fortune. As they pinch
themselves to verify their freshliness:

‘ WINIFRED

MARY

Children.

SARAH

Winifred whacks Mary with the back of her hand, sending

her slamming into a rack of potions. Winifred turns on
the charm.

WINIFRED
Come. out, my dears. We will not
harm you.

MARY

We love children.

Winifred suddenly flips over the table, revealing Dani,
who is petrified. Dressed as a witch, she thinks fast
and pretends to be one.

DANI
Greetings, sisters.

Greetings, little one.
DANI
It was I who brought you back.

what happens.

her face.

Back to Winifred as her rage increases; her electricity
charges up, her hair stands straight on end. Suddenly,
she throws out her hands and zaps Max with a stream of
CRACKLING ELECTRICAL ENERGY.

Mary and Sarah cackle with delight as Max is literally
lifted off the ground, writhing in the electrical field.

SARAH
Burn him to a cinder!

MARY
Roast him, Winnie!

Now Dani gets mad.

DANI
You_leave my brother alone!

She picks up a small pot and beans Winifred with it. The
electrical charge is broken, Max slumps to the ground,
and Winifred goes down to the floor, momentarily stunned,
but in an instant she. has regained her’ senses. She
snatches up Dani with both hands and lifts her off the
ground...

When Allison attacks her, but Winifred easily knocks her
aside with a blow from her hand. Winifred is about to
wring Dani's neck...

Dani finds her candy bag. Winifred is about to grab her
again, when Max suddenly leaps up on the table.

MAX
Hey!

He clicks the lighter, which flames. That catches the
witches' attention.

MAX
You have messed with the Great and
Powerful Max, and must now suffer
the consequences! I summon... the
Burning Rain of Death!

Max (who has positioned himself perfectly) lifts his hand
and holds the flame. under an old sprinkler head on the
ceiling.

For a beat nothing happens, and then an old FIRE ALARM
BELL starts SOUNDING and all the SPRINKLER HEADS on the
ceiling start gushing water.

The witches scream in horror, as they imagine they are
about to die an agonizing death.

SARAH
The Burning Rain of Death!

Screams. While the kids scramble to escape, the black
cat, who is of course Thackery Binx, leaps up onto Max's
shoulder, putting his face right up to Max's. Three
hundred years have turned Binx into a tough, very worldly
cat.

Really. I knew Billy before and

gallows and brought him back to
life to raise a little hell, if
ya know.what I mean. To keep
their secrets, they cut out his
tongue and sewed his mouth shut
with a dull needle.

BACK AT GRAVEYARD - FEW MOMENTS LATER

Dani and Allison listen intently as Binx tells his tale.
Max is still feeling peeved.

DANI
Do you like being a cat a lot?

BINX
At first I enjoyed myself. Being
a cat was a highly sensuous
experience. I slept all day,
prowled around at night... My
family took me in; I slept by the
fire, and everybody petted me.
But then... the years started to
pass. I watched my parents grow
old and die, and my brothers and
sisters... And their children,
and their children. But I was
always left behind.

but I'd always be here to stop
them. They'd never harm another
child, as long as I was here. So
for three centuries I've guarded
that house, especially on Halloween
night...

When I knew some airhead virgin
might light that candle.

ALLISON

What're we gonna do?
BINX

Make sure the hags don't get the

spellbook.

OO This?

BINX

Yes, that. The devil's spellbook.
It contains all of witch Winifred's
most powerful and heinous spells.
(to Max)
Don't let it out of your sight,
and remember this, all of you, it
is evil and only evil can come of
it. Is that clear?

 

All nod.

: BINX
| Good. :

DANI
They did magic at their house, how
come they need it?

BINX
Good point. As near as I can
figure, they have minor magic

they do with it?

BINX
I only saw them conjure with it
once. They'd cooked a potion that,
as near as I could ever figure
out, they planned to give to the
children of Salem Village.

For what?

BINX
I don't know.

MAK
Well, we're just talking about
three old ladies versus the 20th
century, right? I mean, how bad
could it be?

Suddenly, an electric cord drops, dangles from the sky in
front of Max. Binx looks skyward:

BIN
Bad.
WINIFRED
Book be mine!
The spellbook leaps!
BINX

Get it!

Max intercepts... Allison and Dani take cover -- hide

“their eyes. Binx leaps to the tombstone.

BINX
This is hallowed ground. Whisk
off, wretched hags!

WINIFRED

DANI
No way, fatso!

Mary dive-bombs Dani. She flattens to the ground. The
Electrolux zooms inches above.

WINIFRED
Enough! Give me the book or die!

BINK
Land here and take it, evil sow.

Winifred and her sister "air-huddle."

BINK
I don't like this.

MAX
But you said they can't touch us
here, right?... Right?!

: BINX
‘They’ cannot.

ALLISON
Whadda you mean 'they'?

Winifred unpockets the black flame candle. Holds it
ready:

WINIFRED
Souls at peace, remain at rest;
Tortured spirit, join our quest.
Smell with nose, see with eye;
Twist your fingers toward the sky;
Push aside your earthen sheet;
Stand upon your good dead feet.
Life is sweet; be not shy-sleeping

Winifred snaps her craggy fingers and lights the candle.
Binx is thrown off William Butcher's tombstone -- the
gravemarker rolls. Rotted coffin planks erupt from the
grave. Then...

- BILLY THE BUTCHER climbs out. A zombie. His mouth
sewn shut. He blinks the dirt from his eyes -- which are
somehow miraculously intact. Nothing else about him is
though. Dani, Allison and Max are struck dumb and
frozen stiff. Binx leaps onto Max's chest once more.

BINX
Hey!

Ever see i
Dead?

{as Max nods)
Well, it's all true. Zombies eat
people. We're gone like the wind.
Follow me.

After the children!

Billy moves on.Allison and Dani who run after Binx making
tracks out of the graveyard.

MAX
But, you said we can't leave the
cemetery!

BINX
Fine, fine! You stay here then!

Billy growls. Max splits. Billy runs into a low branch

-- knocks his head off -- fumbles around for his noggin.

Finds it. Sets it back. Chases on. The kids sprint for
the cemetery wall. Billy closes. Suddenly, the witches

appear -- hovering right in front of them.

WINIFRED
Peek-a-boo, we see you! Give me
the book!

Binx barrels headlong toward the witches.

BINX
This way!

With total trust, Dani and Allison run after Binx. Max
slows a bit -- skeptical. Mary hovers lowest, hands out,
ready to catch Binx.

Here, kitty kitty!

Binx leaps, right into Mary's waiting hands! No! He
soars over her and disappears into a bramble patch
along the wall. Dani and Allison follow him -- sliding
under Mary, who's looked after Binx -- into the bushes
and vanish as well.

Max sees the escape -- runs faster. Suddenly, Sarah is
hovering in front of him -- he looks back -- Billy's
right’ ontop of him! As Billy.'s bony phalanges reach
for him, Max screams, dashes forward, and...

SARAH
Come to momma, you fresh young
thing!

... rips a momentous slide under Sarah and vanishes
into the bush patch. Billy plows full-body into Sarah,
knocking her into a dizzying series of crazy aerial
oops.

Billy recovers and tears away bushes. He rips at them
so hard, his arm comes flying off on the back-rip. He
runs to get it, revealing that he's uncovered a large
hole in the ground.

WINIFRED
Damnable child! Damn Thackery
Binx! Damn him to the dogs for
eternity!

SARAH
It was your idea to turn him into
a cat, Winnie.

: WINIFRED
Sister, puncture thyself and let
the air out of thy brain.
(to Billy)
Down the hole! After them, rotting
beast! Bring them to me dead or...
"dead"!

Billy crawls down the hole.

Mary air-tumbles back to her sisters -- she's dizzy and
disheveled. Just as she takes a deep breath -- her
nose tears her off in some direction. :

MARY

He lights the makeshift torch, revealing they're under-

“eooohs" and applauds appreciatively.

How do you destroy a witch?

ALLISON
You drive a wooden stake through
its heart, of course.

DANI
Gross.

No disrespect, but this is reality!

BINX
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. It's

Binx sees the chimney smoke forming 3 sinister shapes.

They can't die, because they're not

dead. Spirit only! Winifred's
curse said they'd come back when a
virgin lit the Black Flame Candle.
You did. Back they came. For

this night only. They seek the book
to conjure a potion of life.

SONIC-BOOMING the water! Max hits the other side and
climbs toward the forest's crest.

Winifred negotiates the trees at 150 mph. She closes
the gap.

Max rides the ridge. Winifred is a hundred yards back
and closing like a bullet. He sees her. He brings
his bike to a stop. Guess where?

TOP OF SUICIDE GORGE

Max's pulse soars. He sweats the decision. His fingers
grip the bars. His thighs grip the seat padding. His
hand cinches up the pedal straps. Winifred's 50 yards
back, she'll be here in seconds. Max flips his mountain
light on. It illuminates the killer drop off: sheer and
treacherous. Max swallows.

MAX
Come on. Come on. Okay. Okay.
Okay --

Off he goes! (Ihe Man From Snowy River.)

Winifred arrives, pulls 6 1/2 G's in a 90 degree midair
turn and rockets down the ravine after Max.

Max slides through 60 degree slopes of loose dirt,
jumps off rock faces, slots narrow pass-thrus, and hits
the hardpack forest ground. He tears like a madman
down the hill. Winifred tracks him. Max splits left --
Slaloms the trees. Winifred goes right, joy sticks her
vacu-broom like Chuck Yeager.

Max breaks through and hits the open slope. At the bottom,
approaching fast, a mountain of fill dirt piled against a
wall.

Winifred directs the vacuum thrust backward and overtakes
Max. Makes it to the end of the hill and waits there for
him, hovering at the top of the dirt rise.

The witches buzz the kids in formation. Allison swipes

Billy the Butcher appears, runnin' full bore and wobbly
at them. The second his foot hits the salten circle...
he howls in pain and ignites like a pile of kindling.
Hoppin' ‘round, he dissolves from the feet up, until
finally he is just. a head, and then... he is a memory.

The witches hover overhead. Max unstraps the book and
belts it to his back like a fanny pack.

Max swings! Connects! A skeleton blasts into 216
pieces. Another reaches for Allison, she swings!
Connects! The skull goes flying. Easy! But they keep
coming -- reaching, clutching.

Binx pounces a skull. The skeleton reels. Falls against
a tombstone. Blows into several sections. One arm
clutch-crawls toward Dani. She screams. Binx pounces it.
Tosses it. The other grabs him by the tail. Swings him
around. Max steps on it and 9-irons the fibula. It
ghatters. Binx. goes flying. He scrambles back to the
ray.

Max and Allison blast skeleton after skeleton into
shattering rains of bone fragments.

Max reaches back to swing at the skeletons holding
Allison. Another skeleton rips his bat away. The
skeleton army thoroughly infiltrates the salten circle.
One of them grabs Dani and lifts her high above head.
Another secures Max.
