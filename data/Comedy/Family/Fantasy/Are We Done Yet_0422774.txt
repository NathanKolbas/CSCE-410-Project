EXT. PARK - DAY

It's a family picnic. A beautiful early fall day. And around
the table, the COLLIERS: ANDY, mid forties, physically fit, a
warm, enveloping personality; LIZ, the same age, a little
cooler, still beautiful; ZOE, seventeen, past any awkwardness
of adolescence; and JESS, fifteen, a2 little distant and
judgmental, but you can ascribe it to her age. The party is
in full swing. Andy reaches across the table:

ANDY
Pass some more of that -- that --

LIZ
-- Shrimp salad.

ANDY
Yeah, this yours, Zo -- ?

20E
-- Jess made it ~-

ANDY
-- I haven’t had anything this good
in a long time. When @’ you get to
be such a great cook?

A glare. That’s the stupidest question Jess’s ever heard.

JESS
... I don’t know.

ANDY
(pressing on)
Anyone watching the Laker game
tonight?

ZOE
I’m seeing Jamie tonight.

JESS
Eyery night.

ANDY
Oh, yeah? His house or ours?
(off her look)
Is his father gonna be around?

Hey, I’m just doing my job,

JESS
I’m single.

ANDY
No, I mean --

Does she tell you anything about
her life or is it just me?

Liz looks sympathetically at Jess, then back at Andy.

LIZ
I talked to Cameron today. He said
this semester's been great and he -—-

GUARD (0.S.)
-- Time’s up!

Andy looks over. There’s a prison guard standing there. And
in this direction it becomes clear: this is no park, it’s the
grounds of a prison. We've been watching a family visit.

ANDY
What?... Can’t we just have a few
more minutes?

The guard shrugs "sorry." Everyone gets up from the table.
The girls start cleaning up.

ANDY (CONT'D)
{to the guard)
Give me a second here.

Andy pulls Liz a few feet away. The girls watch.

ANDY (CONT'D)
Everything okay?

Liz
Great, Andy. I mean apart from the

You want me to call him?

LIZ
Wo, Andy. You've done plenty.

GUARD
Let’s go!

Andy tries to take Liz’s hand. She pulls away. He shakes it
off, turns to his daughters

ANDY
So. When do I see you guys again?

Jess shrugs.

20E
Same as always.

He puts his arms out to hug them. Pulls them in, Zoe hugs him
back. Jess merely allows him the moment. He kisses them.

ANDY
I love you both. You know that,
right?
{trying so hard)
I think you got a little taller,
Jess.

She pulls away. He holds on to Zoe a moment longer.
ANDY (CONT‘D)
Listen to your mom, okay? Take care
of each other.

ZOE

He steps back. The guard takes his arm. And they watch as
their father is led away.

INT, PARRA HOUSE - JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Jamie Parra, 18, Hispanic, handsome, naked under the sheets,
sits up in his bed, sketching intently, making reference to
Zoe who sleeps beside him. She stirs. Groggy.

20E
Hey.

He leans over, kisses her, goes back to drawing. She props
herself up on an elbow, looks at the drawing. It's a comic
book panel: a superhero strikes an avenging pose. Behind
him, a vixen with Zoe's features.
ZOE (CONT'D)
What're those?

JAMIE
Wrist deflectors. If someone so
much as shoots her a dirty look,
he's able to intercept it, harness
it, convert it into energy and
shoot it back at them.

ZOE
No, I mean her. Those.
JAMIE
Those? Are breasts.
20E
On what planet? Clearly, not

earth.

She goes to swat him with a pillow, but he's too fast. He
pins her arms down and kisses her.

ZOE (CONT'D)
You heard your dad leave, right?

She slides away, reaches for a sweater.

JAMIE

Jamie bolts into the hallway, wrapping a sheet around

From the kitchen window, Jess sees her sister coming up the

look. Jess silently indicates for her to go around the pack.

approached by a cute, slightly nerdy boy, AARON.

You’re Jessica Collier, right?

She looks up. Unimpressed.

INT, COURTROOM - DAY

JUDGE CONSTANCE PURVIEW presiding. Liz sits at one table,
with NICK, her lawyer. A select few of the named plaintiffs,
old friends of Liz’s, sit on the other side with theirs.

JUDGE PURVIEW

The defendant, Andrew Collier, has
filed a motion to have all claims
against him dismissed.

(beat)
He argues that since his jewelry
business was a corporation, the
plaintiffs should not be allowed to
go after his persona. assets.

Nick smiles at Liz. Exactly.

JUDGE PURVIEW (CONT’ D)

When, however, a corporation is
underfunded, it constitutes little
more than a fraud.

(Liz looks at her lawyer)
Not only did Mr. Collier steal from
his customers, claiming to do
appraisals while swapping their
good diamonds for lesser ones -- he
funneled his ill-gotten profits out
of the corporation ard into his own
pocket. He got rich, the
corporation stayed poor, and his
victims are left with nothing. That
is not what the law intends.

Liz
What?

NICK
Shhh.

JUDGE PURVIEW
The motion to dismiss is denied. We
proceed with trial.

Liz turns, ashen, to her lawyer.

She goes over to a side counter. Laid out on it is display of
leather watch bands. Jess examines them, takes a quick look
around, and then, in one smooth move, deposits a particularly
nice one in her back pack.

Aaron takes this in with a mixture of horror and fear. He’s
stuck to the floor when she brushes past him.
