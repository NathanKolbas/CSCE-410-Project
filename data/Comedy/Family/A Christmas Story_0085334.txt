EXT. THE STEEL MILLS LOOM ~ LONG SHOT. - DUSK 1.
Graphic says Northern Indiana, ‘sometime in the 1940's.

FADE UP TO FIND Hohman, a steel town squatting beside
Lake Michigan; CAMERA PANS the city, then begins a
SERIES OF CUTS to show ever more microcosmic views of
Hohman. ‘The NARRATOR'S VOICE (JEAN SHEPHERD) fades

up. We hear a MEDLEY OF CLASSIC CHRISTMAS CAROLS which
form a striking contrast to the images. .

RALPHIE, FLICK and SCHWARTZ run across a slag heap in
foreground. RANDY. trails behind.

NARRATOR (V.0O.)
Hohman, Indiana. It clings
precariously to the underbody
of Chicago like a barnacle
clings to.the rotting hulk of
a tramp steamer. On the far
horizon, beyond the railroad
yards and the great refinery
tanks, lay our own mysterious,
private mountain range. Dark
and mysterious, cold and
uninhabited, the steel mills
stacked like malignant dominoes
against the steel gray skies.

EXT. JUNKYARD ~- DUSK 2.
Kids run past delapidated fence.

NARRATOR (V.O. Cont'd)
Early December. had seen the first
of the great blizzards of that
year. ‘The wind howling down out
of the Canadian wilds a few
hundred miles to the North
screamed over frozen Lake
Michigan...

- and hit Hohman, laying on the town
great drifts of snow and long,
story-high icicles and sub-zero
temperatures where the air cracked
and sang, streetcar wires creaked
under caked ice and kids plodded
to school. through 45 miles an hour
gales, tilting forward like tiny,
furred radiator ornaments.

4. EXT, DOWNTOWN HOHMAN - NIGHT 4. '
Filled with cars and shoppers.

NARRATOR :
But over it all, like a faint, thin
off-stage chorus was the building
excitement. Christmas was on its
way. Each day was more exciting
than the last, because Christmas
was one day closer.

5. EXT. DOWNTOWN HOHMAN ~ TRACKING SHOT - KIDS WEAVING 5.
EMONGS' PPERS — NIGHT

NARRATOR .
Lovely, beautiful, glorious
Christmas, around which the entire
kid year revolved. Downtown Hohman
was prepared for its yearly
1 Bacchanalia of peace on earth and
good will to men. |

 

6. EXT. HIGBEE'S DEPT. STORE = EXTRAS -. NIGHT 6.

CAMERA CUTS TO A WIDE SHOT of Higbee's Department
Store window. Citizens stand "cohing" and "“aahing"

in front of the Yule splendor. CAMERA MOVES IN TOWARD
the window.

NARRATOR Looe

Higbee's Department Stores' corner
window was traditionally a major high-
water mark of the pre-Christmas season.
It set the tone, the motif of their
giant Yuletide Jubilee. Kids were

_ brought in from miles around just to

( ) see the window.

NARRATOR (V.O. Cont'd)
Old codgers would recall vintage
years when the window had flowered
more fulsomely than in ordinary
times. This was one of those years.
The magnificent display had been
officially unveiled on a crowded
Saturday night. It was an instant
smash hit.

CAMERA PANS the rapt faces peering in. One little boy
RALPHIE comes bobbing up between the legs of a startled
grownup. We see. FLICK, SCHWARTZ and RANDY also.

NARRATOR (Cont'd)
First nights packed earmuff to
earmuff, their steamy breath
clouding up the sparkling plate
glass, jostled in rapt admiration
before a golden, tinkling panoply
of mechanized electronic joy.

CAMERA PANS the window. Over this SHOT we see the
OPENING TITLES. .

This is the heyday of the Seven Dwarfs and their virginal
den mother Snow White. Walt Disney's seven cutie+pies
hammer and chisel and paint while Santa, bouncing Snow
White on his. mechanical knee, ho-he-ho's through eight
strategically placeé loudspeakers -- interspersed by
choruses of "Heigh ho, heigh ho, it's off to work we go".
Grumpy sits at the controls of a miniature eight-wheel
Rock Island Road steam engine and Sleepy plays a marimba,
while in the background, inexplicably, Mrs. Claus 1
ceaselessly irons a red shirt. Sparkling artificial
snow drifts down on Shirley Temple dolls, Flexible
Flyers, and Tinker Toy sets glowing in the golden spot-
light. In the foreground a frontier stockade built of
Lincoln Logs is manned by a company of kilted lead
Highlanders who are doughtily fending off an attack by
six U.S. Army medium tanks. (History has always been
vague in Indiana.) A few feet away stands an Arthurian
cardboard castle with Raggedy Andy sitting on the draw~
bridge, his feet in the moat, through which a Lionel
freight train burping real smoke goes round and round.
Dopey sits in Amos and Andy's pedal-operated Fresh Air
Taxicab beside a stuffed panda holding a lollipop in

his paw, bearing the heart-tugging legend, "Hug Me".

a great one. Like a swelling
Christmas balloon, the excitement
mounted until the whole town.
tossed restlessly in bed -- and
made. plans for the big day.
Already my own scheme was well
under way, a scheme whose

Olympian perserverance made that

CAMERA PANS FROM Ralphie's rapt fact TO the beaming

face of Red Ryder, who is hustling the Daisy. BB rifle

to aching kids everywhere. We DISSOLVE TO the entranced
face of Ralphie.

 

7. INT. RALPH PARKER'S HOUSE = DAY 7

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that Ralphie is reading
"Boy's Life." Downstairs we hear the hectic routine of
a school morning. The omnipresent RADIO CRACKLES in the
background. Ralphie's FATHER, hereafter known as The
Old Man, roars dimly in the distance as he fights the
good fight against the indefatigable Indiana winter.
Ralphie's MOTHER calls intermittently the waning minutes
before school deadline.

NARRATOR
I remember. clearly, itchingly,
nervously, maddeningly the first
time I laid eyes on it, pictured
in a three-color smeared
illustration in a full-page back
cover ad in 'Boy's Life.' .

CAMERA CUTS to Ralphie's POV and STARTS A SLOW ZOOM

INTO the smiling face of Red Ryder. We see the fallow-

BOYS! AT LAST YOU-CAN OWN AN OFFICIAL RED RYDER CARBINE
ACTION TWO HUNDRED SHOT RANGE MODEL AIR RIFLE.

NARRATOR (Cont'd)
Red Ryder, his jaw squared,
staring out at me manfully, and
speaking directly to: me eye to
eye. In his hand was the knurled
stock of as beautiful, as coolly
deadly looking a piece of
weaponry as I'd ever laid eyes on.

CAMERA PANS OVER its page, seeing the following copy
as we hear Ralphie begin reading it out loud to himself.

The SOUND of

RALPH (0.S.)

my range wars chasin' them
rustlers and bad guys can be
your very own! It has a special
built-in secret compass in the
stock for telling the direction
if you're lost on the trail, and
also an official Red Ryder
sundial for telling time out in
the wilds. You just lay your
cheek 'gainst this stock, sight
over my own special design
Cloverleaf sight, and you just
can't miss. Tell Dad it's great
for target shooting and varmits,
and it will make a swell Christmas
gift!

Ralph's VOICE REVERBERATES AND ECHOES.
RALPH (O.S.)

(continuing)

Make a swell Christmas Lift,
Make a swell Christmas See.

CAMERA CUTS TO Ralphie and begins a SLOW 200M INTO his

eyes.

NARRATOR
A swell Christmas gift! Here
was Red Ryder himself nailing
me, his pal Ralphie with his
calculatingly demonic underplay
-~ knowing full well that it was
not merely a swell Christmas gift
but the Christmas gift -- the
quintessential Christmas gift,
the Holy Grail of Christmas gifts.
Por the first time in my life the
initial symptoms of genuine lunancy,
of mania set in.

 

CAMERA HAS ARRIVED AT AN EXTREMELY CLOSE SHOT of }
Ralphie's eye. We DISSOLVE to the following, which
is Ralphie's daydream fantasy.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to see Ralphie on one knee, his trusty |
Red Ryder air rifle at the ready. As CAMERA CONTINUES

WT TO PULL BACK we see Ralphie's Father huddle in the corner,
— his arms about Ralphie's Mother, whose eyes roll with

cosmic fear. At her feet, RANDY, Ralphie's brother, is

clasped in his mother's desperate arms, his fingernails

poised before his chattering teeth. His eyes stare as

if they beheld the coming of the millenium. Ralphie's

Father speaks:

FATHER 1
Save us, Ralphie!

For your mother's. sake.

With Herculean caim Ralphie turns

He holds up his BB air rifle.

Then CAMERA CUTS BEHIND what is obviously the kitchen
sink of Ralphie's house. Slowly Ralphie's face
appears over the edge. The steely eyes survey the
scene before him.

EXT. BACKYARD - RALPHIE'S POV - DAY 9.

Looking past the kitchen faucet and out the kitchen
window we see what Ralphie sees! At various points
across the backyard, desperate men are creeping on

their bellies across the snow toward the house. There
are about eight.of them, and each wears a thin Bandit-
Burglar type black mask, the kind that looks like goggles.
They all wear striped shirts and carry blackjacks. One
nears the house; two are slinking over the fence. One
crawls through the garage door.

MED. SHOT - RALPHIE

He surveys the situation coolly, then fast as a whip-
snake he leaps. up and snaps off THREE SHOTS.

LONG SHOT - THE YARD

Three bad guys leap acrobatically into the air, mortally
wounded. The others stand up, stricken into dumbness
by the sting of "Ol' Blue." They race unceremoniously
and plunge headlong over the fence and disappear down
the alley. We...

CUT BACK TO:

THE FAMILY

They cheer wildly, embracing Ralphie. Ralphie stands
tolerating this stoically but kindly.

FAMILY
You saved us, Ralphie, you saved

us! We were all goners, Ralphie,
and you saved us!.

CLOSEUP - RALPHIE

NARRATOR
I turned away after a moment,
staring into the danger zone
bravely; heroically, with just a
trace showing in my.eyes of that |
distant hurt that was afflicted
upon me by my now contrite
family.

 

Suddenly Ralphie is startled and we hear a voice.

BACK TO REALITY

" MOTHER {O.S.)
Ralphie! Randy! Downstairs in
two minutes.

We realize Ralohie has been jarred out of his fantasy
by his mother's voice. He leaps up and scurries to get
ready. Randy plunges into the drawer and starts to do
his Little Brother thing. Two minutes means two
minutes.

Mothers know nothing about
creeping marauders burrowing
through the snow toward the
kitchen where only you and
you alone stand between your tiny
huddled family and insensate
Evil. There was no question
about it. Not only should I
have such.a gun -~ it was an °
absolute necessity! Race
memories of Kid plots through
the ages began to surge through
my cortex into conscious

strategy.
INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - RALPH - DAY 11.

CAMERA FOLLOWS Ralphie into his parents' room where we
see him pick up a copy of "Screen Romances” and slip
“Boy's Life" between the covers.

NARRATOR
My mother, grabbing for her
copy of 'Screen Romances’ would
find herself cleverly euchered
into reading a Red Ryder sales
pitch.

MOTHER (0.S.)
Ralphie! Randy!

MED. SHOT ~-. THE HALLWAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Randy and Ralphie down the hallway, .
LOSING Randy and FOLLOWING Ralphie to the bathroom
door. He barges in and we find The Old Man in the
final strokes of shaving. de looks down at Ralphie.
Ralphie cleverly puts the “Boy's Life" behind his
back.

had understood the power of that
unassailable defense, the world
would be very different today.

The Old Man looks back to the mirror to wipe the lather
off. He walks from the bathroom.

FATHER
There you go.

The door closes. CAMERA FOLLOWS The Old Man as he
waiks to the dining room table, sits down and unfolds
his morning paper, immediately going to the sports

page.

FATHER

Son of a bitch. They traded
Dulbelsky. I don't believe

CAMERA PANS UP TO FIND Ralphie's Mother coming to the
table with breakfast.

My father was one of the most
feared Furnace Fighters in
Northern Indiana. People in
Northern Indiana fought winter
tooth and claw, bodily, and
there was never a let-up. That's

opened her mouth, I knew what

was coming.

MOTHER

All right, you two, out the door

NARRATOR
My mother planned these
tactical retreats whenever my
father was about to go into
combat with the iron dragon
in the basement. In the heat
of battle, my father wove a
tapestry of obscenity that,
as far as we know, is still
hanging in the space over Lake
Michigan.

The SOUNDS that come hurtling out of that basement
would cause such loss of face to the producer of a
Japanese monster movie that he would be forced to
impale himself post-haste on the nearest ceremonial
sword. ROARS, CLANKS, SNORTS, RATTLES, MUMBLES,
GROANS, SCREAMS! Meanwhile Randy and Ralphie start
to put on their overclothes.

FATHER (0.S.)

damper, will you? How
the hell did it get turned

dammit!

Mother flies to the kitchen and pulls the chain marked
"draft." CAMERA PANS BACK TO the cellar door and
HOLDS. All is silent for a few seconds; then suddenly
a great ROAR and the SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS pounding up
the steps. The door flies open and The Old Man emerges
from a cloud of blue smcke like Mephistopheles appear-

stygian darkness below the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS
Mother as she moves to help Randy with his clothes.

NARRATOR
‘Preparing to go to school was
like getting ready for extended
deep-sea diving; long johns,
corduroy knickers, checkered
flannel lumberjack shirt, four
sweaters, fleece-lined
leatherette sheepskin, helmet,
goggles, mittens with leatherette
gauntlets and a large red star
with an Indian chief's face in
the middle.

Mother has Randy practically on his head trying to

stuff him into his snowsuit. Finally she gets him in
and stands him up. He stands with both hands extended
from his sides like a tiny scarecrow. Mother begins

to wrap an enormous scarf around his neck. We hear a
faint whimpering coming from inside Randy's suit. The
sound is totally muffled. Randy stands forlornly with
his arms sticking straight out like an abandoned semaphor.

RANDY .
Um! Um! Um! Uhbum!

he was saying.

RANDY

tearfully)
I can't put my arms down.

Mother stands back and appraises the situation. Sure
enough, Randy can't put his arms down. Mother steps
forward and forces Randy's asms down to his side. As
soon aS she steps away, however, they spring back.
Randy whimpers. Mother steps forward and tries again.
Up they spring again.

MOTHER
You'll put your arms down when
you get to school.

NARRATOR
In Indiana, sometimes solutions
are very practical.

She proceeds to rewind Randy against his furious protests.

NARRATOR
(continuing)

There was no question of staying
home. Cold was something that
was accepted, like air, clouds
and parents, a fact of nature,
and as such could not be used

in any fraudulent scheme to stay
out of school. My mother would
simply throw her shoulder against
the front door, pushing back the
advancing drifts and stone ice.

dim territorial imperative stretching back over the
centuries.

NARRATOR
Any reference to one's mother was
like throwing. down the gauntlet,
no matter how vague or remote the

one's mother with any adjective

innocuous, was grounds for instant

But it is too late. A face appears suddenly in the gap

the face of meanness personified. It is the dreaded
GROVER DILL. The MUSIC SHUDDERS appropriately.

: NARRATOR

Grover Dill! What a rotten
name. We were trapped.

There. he stood between us and
the alley, Grover Dill staring
out at us with his yellow eyes.
He had yellow eyes. So help me
God, yellow eyes! His cap slunk
lew over his non-existent brow,
resting on his ears, which
flared out like toadstools. His
lips curled over his green teeth
in a semblance of speech.

DILL
Hey! Fat mess!

NARRATOR
I turned in a blind primal
panic and started for the
fence at the end of the
alley. No hope. There,
curling up like a venomous
Cheshire cat, was Dili's
fierce little toady Scut
Farkas. We had had it.
The lines were clearly drawn.

Dill was a running-nose type

I did not know one kid who was
not afraid. of Dill, because
Dill was truly aggressive.

life is often called Talent or

necessary that Ralph be given
a Red Ryder BB gun, for the
protection of your family.

such a recommendation, but

Red Ryder BB gun with his
customary skill and responsibility.

barbed wire, corncobs, an ironing board and a lot of
big tall water boilers with pipes sticking out. The
Old Man is trying to get out of the car.

they had at least seven
hundred and forty-five dogs!
Now our neighborhood had
always had dogs walking around,
ordinary dogs with names like
Zero or Prince, The Bumpus
hounds, on the other hand,
were just a great churning
mass of tails and tongues
and flea-bitten bodies. You
could almost see the smell --
: and they loved my father.
They ignored every other
human being on earth but my
Qld Man. Every time he set
foot outside the whole tidal

half of them were trying to
lick his face and the other
half were trying to take off

NARRATOR
The depression days were the
golden age of the newspaper
contest and The Old Man was
a giant jackpot puzzle contest
junkie. There was an endless
parade of ‘Name the Presidents,‘
‘Mystery Movie Stars,‘ 'Famous
Figures in History,' and 'How
many mistakes are in this
Picture,' all offering fifty
thousand dollar giant jackpots.
For the cost of a two=cent
newspaper, countless millions
struggled nightly to hit the
jackpot. Every evening the
Chicago American was spread
out on’ the dining room table.
Paste pot handy, scissors and
ruler, pen and ink at the ready,
The Old Man clipped and glued,
struggled and guessed -- and
now the payoff had come!

Ralphie arrives downstairs as The Old Man lunges
through the front door, closing it on the ears of

one of the most insistent of the SNARLING pack. The
dog HOWLS in the background as The Old Man leaps about
the living room waving a telegram over his head.

FATHER
I won! I won! I won!

MOTHER
What! What! What is it?

FATHER
A major prize. A major prize.

BACK TO SCENE

The Old Man is now dancing a jig around the room. The
kids are whooping, the dog, whose ears are in the door,
is HOWLING.

FATHER
Tonight, it's coming tonight.
Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!
Hot dam, tonight!

What do you mean?

FATHER
Tonight! It's coming tonight.
I called Ernie McClosky down

there.

The old man continues his jig.

FATHER
(continuing)
Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!

He dances over to the door and releases the poor dog's
ear. He sticks his leg out the front door and holds
it there comically.

MOTHER
But how could they deliver
a bowling alley tonight.

The Old Man is stumped for a minute.

FATHER
Well, they could deliver the
deed, for Chrissake. I mean,
I didn't think they were

alley.

He laughs. Nothing is going to spoil his expansiveness.

feet twined around the legs of his chair, poking
listlessly at his food. He begins to plow the sur-

Randy fidgets, stirs milk with finger, pushes food
from one side of plate to the other, now arranging
red cabbage in an artistic circle around his cold,
congealing slice of meatloaf.

FATHER
Knock it off. Eat.

Every meal went the same way.
Once in a while, my father

‘Dammit,’ he'd yell, ‘I'll

Suddenly, Randy bends forward, shoves face into plate,
begins to gobble food frantically, “oinking" all the

while. Mother smiles as plate is emptied.

His tone is one of total disgust.

one down in disgust and scribbles a large "F" on it. She
picks up another and gives it the same treatment, and another
and yet another. She puts her hand to her forehead in despair
for’a moment, then she plunges in again.

She begins reading Ralphie's theme. Her face brightens. Her
mouth flies open. She reads on. She utters an exclamation
of joy and clasps the theme to her bosom, silent movie style.

She begins reading again, barely able to contain herself.

With every sentence, she exclaims in ecstasy. Finally, she
can contain herself no more. She leaps to her feet, throwing
the theme into the air, and races to the blackboard. She
writes Ralphie's name on the board in huge letters and follows
this with: ,

RALPHIE DEFER FAPEEEAEALEEA EE EERE PEPE EEE EEE

A huge "A"; then she begins writing plusses after the A. She
writes plusses until she runs out of board, then continues
writing them. off the board and around the walls.

standing modestly, acknowledging the thunderous ovation of his
adoring classmates. We HOLD on this for a long moment, then...

galoshes open, wiping his nose on his sleeve.

Ralph and the others ignore him, moving in a sort of
purposeless ramble, slowly working their way home,
kicking at cans; Schwartz hurls a rock languidly

at a telephone pole insulator, not even bothering to
turn and see if it hits.. Obviously, they do this
every day.

They are passing before a wooden fence. The old
familiar MUSIC creeps up, very faintly. Ralph drags
a stick across the pickets, making a rasping sound.

CAMERA PANS DOWN the fence. We see the familiar
brogans matching Ralphie's stride-for-stride. The
boys are oblivious to the menace. Such unwariness
does not go unpunished in the jungles of boyhood.

something. He stops. and looks in the direction of
the fence.

RALPHIE
Run! It's Dillit!

But it is too late. A face appears suddenly in the gap
between two boards. It is a malevolent face. It is
the face of meanness personified. It is the dreaded
GROVER DILL. The MUSIC SHUDDERS appropriately.

NARRATOR
Grover Dill! What a rotten
name. We were trapped.
There he stood between us and
the alley, Grover Dill staring
out at us with his yellow eyes.
He had yellow eyes. So help me
God, yellow eyes! His cap slunk
low over his non-existent brow,
resting on his ears, which
flared out like toadstools. His
lips curled over his green teeth
in a. semblance of speech.

DILL
Hey! Fat mess!
NARRATOR

I turned in a blind primal
panic and started for the
fence at the end of the
alley. No hope. There,
curling up like a venomous
Cheshire cat, was Dill's
fierce Little toady Scut
Farkas. We had had it.

I did not know one kid who was

Dill was truly aggressive.

The Christmas tree is finally chosen. After a great

deal of difficulty, it is securely lashed to the back
of the car, sticking out cf the trunk and tied to the «

bumpers with lengths of grimy, knotted rope.

We see the family in the car, looking at the decorations.
Christmas lights festoon houses, plastic Santas

smile from the tops of garages, plastic wreaths of ¢

holly hang from the lamp posts surrounding smiling

Santa faces. A choir of Christmas carollers accompanies
this tableau.

We see a Nativity group on a front lawn. Joseph and
Mary kneel in the straw, adoring the Infant, watched
by three plastic sheep, a plastic cow, and Rudolph The
Red-Nosed Reindeer, his nose a bright red bulb.

weedy ravine, weed tops poking out of the drifted
snow. In the dark and slushy night, The Old Man
struggles with his worn and patched spare tire.

NARRATOR
(continuing)

My Old Man's spare tires were
actually only tires in the
_ academic sense. They were
round; they had once been made
of rubber, but by the time
they were in the dark bullpen
of the car's trunk to be used as
spares. There was so little
tread on them that The Old Man
used to say you could read the
Want Ads of the Tribune right
through them.

The ole Man busily fits jack, jacks up car, begins
to remove wheel bolts with wrench.. Ralph watches.

What the hell are you doing?

RALPH
Mom said I should help.

FATHER
Oh. Yeh. Listen, hold this
hubcap. I'm gonna put the
bolts in it. Fer Chrissake,
don't move it!

The Old Man struggles with the tire. Ralph stands

next to him, holding the hubcap. Cars whiz by, throwing
slush from under their tires. A giant semi roars

past, throwing up such a plume of slush and icy, filthy
water that Ralph flinches.

clay, the way Michelangelo
worked in marble. It was his
true medium, and he was a
master at it.

Indiana. Snow was drifting '
softly through the feeble
yellow glow of the distant
street lamps while around me
unbridled merriment raged. I
had all but abandoned hope,
which may partially explain
what happened next.

We are CLOSE on Ralph's face when suddenly a brackish
snowball about the size of a basketball whistles INTO
FRAME and smacks Ralph right in the kisser. It nearly
knocks him off his feet. He clears the slush from his
eyes and chokes back the tears that threaten to well
up. He looks 0.8.

Somewhere deep in the recesses
of my brain a tiny red-hot
little flame began to. grow.

Dill has strutted up and stands, legs spread, in front
of Ralph. .

DILL
Listen, Jerk, when I tell ya
to come over, ya better come
over.

NARRATOR
By this time my red demon
had grown to man size and
came exploding out of my
eyes and ears and mouth.

Ralphie explodes all over the startled Dill, knocking
him flat on his back and begins pounding him.

Bravery does not exist, just
a kind of latent nuttiness.
If I had thought about
attacking Dill for ten
seconds before I had done it,
I'd have teen four blocks

fuse blew and I had gone out

NARRATOR

I could hear my brother

Boys continue to fight insanely. Dill by this time

is wailing hysterically. This has never happened to
him before. They drag the two kids apart amid a great
ring of surging grownups and exultant, scared kids

who knew more about what is happening than the mothers

I had awakened that morning
with the glowing realization
that all was not yet lost.
There was one last hope, one
appeal as yet unfiled, one
glorious, maddening ray of
_Daisy sunshine that had as

Man himself, Number One. The
Head Honcho. The Connection
-- Santa Claus! Now it is
well-known that foolish men
stuff themselves with pillows
and other such devices and
run around ringing bells in
the street in order to siphon
off some of the Christmas

We PULL BACK from the real Santa's laughing face to
TAKE IN the full scope of Higbee's Department

eyed, foundry workers, grey-faced refinery men, motley
hordes of open hearth, slag heap, Bessemer converter,
tin mill, coke plant and welding shop fugitives trudg-
ing through the wildly pulsing store, through floor
after floor of shiny, beautiful, unattainable treasures,
trailed by millions of leatherette-jacketed, high-
topped, mufflered kids. Worried-looking, flush-faced
mothers wearing frayed cloth coats with ratty fox-fur
collars, their hands chapped and raw from years of
dishwater therapy, ride herd on the surging mob,
ranging far and wide into the aisles and under the

' counters; cuffing, slapping, dragging whiners of all
sizes from department to department.

Ralph, Randy, Mother and Father are carried forward by
the waves of maddened shoppers. They pause by a coun-_

It was not easy to disbelieve
fully in Santa Claus, because
there wasn't much else to
believe in, and there were
many theological arguments
over the nature of, the

and denial of his existence.

The shoving, restless, sniffling, whining line slowly
inches forward. Far ahead we see a gigantic snowy
throne, framed with red-and-white candy canes, under
a suspended squadron of plastic angels blowing silver
trumpets. The line slowly moves forward.

Flyers, there were few who
dared to disbelieve.

We see (RALPH'S POV) a glowing golden grotto at the

is exaggeratedly high, like a soaring glass mountain
stretching up to infinity before the kids.

Behind Ralph and Randy a skinny seven-year-old girl
wearing a brown stocking cap and gold-rimmed glasses

-hits her little brother steadily to keep him in line.

He is wearing an aviator's helmet with goggles pulled
down over his eyes. His galoshes are open and his
maroon corduroy knickers are damp. Behind them, a
fat boy in a huge sheepskin coat stands numbly, his
eyes watering in vague fear, his nose red and running.

CAMERA TAKES IN long line, an uneven procession of
stocking caps, mufflers, mittens and earmuffs inch-
ing painfully forward, while in the hazy distance,

in his magic glowing cave, SANTA CLAUS waits to sit
each in turn on his broad red knee. Over the ser-
pentine line roars a great sea-of sound: TINKLING
BELLS, RECORDED CAROLS, THE HUM AND CLATTER OF ELEC-
TRIC TRAINS, WHISTLES TOOTING, MECHANICAL COWS MOOING,
CASH REGISTERS DINGING, and from far off in the faint
distance the "Ho-ho-ho-ing" of jolly old Saint Nick.

Ralph and Randy wind slowly through the Tricycle and
Bicycle Department, jostled and pushed by the hordes
of kids behind them. Suddenly they reach the head

of the line, the foot of Mount Olympus itself.
Santa's enarmous gleaming white snowdrift of a throne

‘ soars ten or fifteen feet above their heads on a

mountain of red and green tinsel carpeted with flash-
ing Christmas tree bulbs and gleaming ornaments.

Each kid in turn is prodded up a tiny staircase at

\the side of the mountain on Santa's left as Santa

passes his last customer on to his right and down a
winding red chute which gives the kid a little ride
down to floor level and back into oblivion for another
year. Pretty ladies dressed in Snow White costumes,
gauzy gowns glittering with sequins and tiaras clipped
to their golden, artificial hair, preside at the head
of the line, directing traffic and keeping order.

Randy begins to hang back, whining and whimpering
steadily. ‘Ralph herds him ahead of himself while,
behind, the girl in the glasses does the same with
her kid brother. SNOW WHITE grabs Randy's shoulder
with an iron grip, Launching nim up the slope.

We see his brother's tiny yellow and brown stocking cap
as it bobs on Santa's lap what seems miles above the
floor. We hear a thin, high trailing wail. Suddenly
the abyss opens before Ralph.

BACK TO SCENE

Snow White grabs his elbow with an iron claw and Ralph
begins to struggle upward toward the mountaintop.

NARRATOR
I have always felt that later
generations of tots, products of
less romantic upbringing, cynical
non-believers in Santa Claus from
birth; can never know the nature
of the true dream. I was well
into my twenties before I finally
gave up on the Easter Bunny, and
i am not convinced that I am the
richer for it. I had long before
decided to levei with Santa, to
really lay it on the line. No
kid stuff. If I was going to
ride the range with Red Ryder,
Santa Claus was going to have to
get the straight poop.

This Santa Claus is not the conventional department store

Santa, but rather Santa as he is seen thuugh a child's
eyes. He is ENORMOUS, seemingly eight feet tall; high
shiny black patent-Leather boots, a nimbus of snow white
beard, and a real thrumming, belt-creaking stomach. His
voice is amplified to a thundering pitch. He seems vast,
immense, enormous, world=filling, God like to the eyes
of Ralph.

only bright spot in an otherwise
remarkably mediccre haul: a
rubber Frankenstein face.

Ralph immediately puts on Frankenstein face.
MOTHER
Oh, how terrible. Take it
off and put it away.

FATHER
I think it looks good on him.

Ralph stands up, does his famous Frankenstein walk,

clumping stiff legged around the living room and back
to the tree.

Finally it is all over.’ There are no more mysterious
packages under the tree, only a great pile of crumpled
tissue paper, string, and empty boxes. Randy lies
dozing amid the rubble, the zeppelin clasped in one
hand and his new fire truck in the other.

NARRATOR

There was no denying that I
had scored heavily with the
Simoniz and the fly swatter,
as well as the zeppelin. The
joy of giving can uplift the
saddened heart. But then it
came. I must admit I had
been completely taken in.

Father leans forward in his easy chair, his eighth glass
of wine in his hand. He gets up ceremoniously and moves
over to the tree.

FATHER
Say!

(he pauses dramatieally)
Don't I see something over
there stuck behind the drapes?
Why, I think there is something
over there behind the drapes.

Ralph looks up, afraid to believe. He runs to drapes
and pulls them out. Sure enough there it is, a long,
heavy, red-wrapped package. It is marked To Ralphie,
From Santa. Frantically, Ralph tears the wrappings
off.

NARRATOR
A Red Ryder carbine~action
range-model BB gun!

Ralph makes inarticulate gasps of surprise and eestasy.

I could hardly wait to try it
out, but the instruction book
said, in Red Ryder's own words:

Kids, never fire a BB gun in

Now hush! Ralphie, be care-

By this time Mother is in the kitchen and pulling a golden
succulent turkey out of the oven. She places it on the
table. The old man pulls some skin away.

MOTHER
For heavens sake it's not
even done yet, now go read
the funnies and let me work.

EXT. ‘BACKYARD = DAY 74.

NARRATOR
I stood in the clean air,
ready to consummate my great,
long painful, ecstatic love
affair.

Ralph brushes snow off front step, props up a gleaming
Red Ryder target, the black rings and bull's eye
standing out starkly against the snowy whiteness. He
backs off into ‘the snow a good twenty feet, slams the
stock down onto his left kneecap, hooks his fingers into
the icy carbine lever and cocks his blue-steel beauty
for the first time.

Ralph sights over the barrel. Slowly, slowly he squeezes
the frosty trigger. Back...back....back.

NARRATOR
(continuing)
For one instant I thought
wildly, It doesn't work. We'll
have to send it back. Tt...

CRAAAACK!
The gun jerks upward. Ralph's horn=rimmed glasses spin
from his head into a snowbank. He stands paralyzed,

not knowing what has happened. Slood trails down his
cheek and onto the walnut stock of the Red Ryder BB gun.

The BB has ricocheted off the tin target and struck
Ralphie on the cheek.

Finally, snapping out of his daze, Ralph scrambles
around in the snow for his glasses. He finds them at
last.

NARRATOR

(continuing)
I knew immediately that I
had not shot my eye out, but
the glasses were another
story. They were pulverized!
Few things in those time brought
such swift and terrible retri-
bution on a kid.as the pair of
busted glasses. The left lens
was out as clean as a whistle,
and for a moment I thought
I'll fake it!  Thev'll never
know the lens is gone: But
then, gingerly fingering my
rapidly swelling black eye, I
realized that here was a shiner
on the way that would top even
the one I got from Grover Dill.

 

The back door opens just a crack. Ralph can. see the blur
of his Mother's Chinese-red chenille bathrobe.

MOTHER
(calling)
Be careful. Don't shoot your
eye out!
NARRATOR

She hadn't seen. She didn't

Ralph dashes into the house, meets Mother right inside the
door. Mother sees his broken glasses, sees the long
bloody scrape on his cheek.

Mother leads Ralph into the bathroom, wets washcloth in
cold water, puts it on Ralph's cheek. Ralph still
clutches BB gun to his chest.

There now, see. It's just a
little bump. You're lucky
you didn’t cut your eye. Those
icicles sometimes even kill
people. You're really lucky.

Nothing, we'll be right down
and stay away from that turkey.
It has to cook for another
hour. You'll get worms.

NARRATOR
Now it is well known through-
out the midwest that the old
man is a turkey junkie. A
bonafide galli turkecanus freak.
A few days before Christmas
his eyes would begin to gleam
with a wild and ravenous light.
Every few hours he would check
his carving set to make sure
the knife was honed,the fork
tines sharp.

INT. KITCHEN > DAY 76.

We see the Old Man leaning over the turkey drawing a long
deep draft of turkey essence into his nostrils. He glides
back to his chair and sits taking up the sports page with
great satisfaction.

INT. BATHROOM = DAY 77.

 

Mother is still cleaning Ralphie's wounds.

NARRATOR
Life is like that. Sometimes
at the height of our reveries
when our joy is at its zenith.
When all is most right with
the world, the most unthinkable
disasters descend upon us.

We hear a huge crash, followed closely by another,
then a thundering bellow from the Old Man.

We see the old man peering in horror over his newspaper.
After’ a beat we see what the tragedy is. A blur

streaks by the foreground of our shot. The old man
stares. Then another blur whizzes by. Then another and
we realize we are seeing the Bumpuses' hound. Now the
whole pack roars past. The old man scrambles to his

. feet.

OLD MAN
Holy Christ, the turkey!
The turkey. Those goddamned
dogs. The turkey.

He races for the kitchen just in time to see the dogs
leap upon the table, grab the twelve pound turkey and
in a-mass of snarling fury, disappear through the
kitchen door all but taking it off the hinges.

Ralphie, Randy and Mother arrive just in time to see the
Old Man staring out the door as the sound of the hounds
recedes in the distance.

Finally the old Man turns and walks back into the kitchen.
He stands looking down_at the big sheet of wax paper
dripping with warm turkey gravy and big clumps of oyster
stuffing.

NARRATOR
The heavenly aroma still hung
heavy in the house. But it
was gone -~ all gone -- no
turkey -~ no turkey sandwiches
no turkey salad, no turkey
gravy, turkey hash, turkey
a la king, or gallons of
turkey soup, gone, all gone.
The 61d Man came as close to
erying as I'd ever seen him
come.

The Old Man stands there quivering with frustration.
Finally,

OLD MAN
Get your coats! We're going
to the chinese joint. We're
going to have Chop Suey!

We understood. Naturally.
There was no other restaurant
open on Christmas day, but it
went deeper than that. But
we understood.

EXT. /TNT. = CHINESE RESTAURANT - DUSK 79.

We hear a faint Chinese tune emanating from the restaurant.
We are across the. street looking in at the family. They
are the only customers. The happy Chinese family hover
around them. ‘Two waiters, come marching out with a wilted
potted palm dotted. with a sad string of colored lights.

They are followed by a waiter carrying a tray bearing a
large duck. The tray is placed before the family. We
hear an exchange, then the Old Man begins to beam, the
family digs in. .

NARRATOR
That Christmas would live in
our memories as the Christmas
when we were introduced to
Chinese turkey. All was right

Next to me in the blackness

the greatest Christmas gift I
had ever received. Gradually
I drifted off to sleep, pranging
ducks on the wing and getting off
spectacular hip shots as I
dissolved into nothingness.

INT. LIVING ROOM ~- NIGHT , 82.

The lights are dim; only the Christmas tree glows, its
icicles reflecting the multi colored bulbs. The gentle
sounds of "Silent Night" swell softly from the Crosley
Cathedral RADIO.

Mother has cleared away the last of the debris. She
erosses the room to where the.Old Man sits luxuriating
in the glow of the wine and the moment. Mother stops
and looks down at the Old Man. For these brief moments
all is right with the world.

They look at one another with a oneness of satisfaction
that comes rarely to any of us. It is a nice moment,
simple, uncontrived and affecting. Mother sits beside
the Old Man and their hands entwine and they share; no
words are needed.

INT. RALPHIE's BEDROOM 83.

The room is dark. We hear a faint sound like a BEEPING.
CAMERA DOLLIES TOWARD the sound. We can make out a
figure under the covers.

THE BEEPING SOUND gets louder. As we near the bed,
Randy suddenly pops out from under the covers and looks
around furtively and comically for a moment. Then he
Lifts his zeppelin from under the covers and whirls it
through the air a couple of time, then ducks quickly
beneath the blanket and continues his joyous journey
with his magical zeppelin.
