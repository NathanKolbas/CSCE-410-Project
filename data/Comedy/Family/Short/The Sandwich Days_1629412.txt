ADMISSIONS REP (V.O.)
So, tell me about your childhood.

FADE IN:
INT. ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM - FLASHBACK - MORNING

Several fifth graders talk among each other before the beginning
of class. The sound is muffled. YOUNG BILLIAM (11) does not talk
and looks lonely at his desk. He draws on some paper being quite
pleased with his work. Some children accidently push a desk
against his causing his pencil to move upwards. His picture is
ruined with a long straight line in the middle. His little,
personal world is disrupted with the bang causing the muffled
talking around him turn instantly clear.

MRS. ZIMMERMAN stands at the front of the class taking
attendance.

MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Okay, everybody settle down now.
It may be the first day in class, and
I know we’re all excited here. Let’s see
if I can learn your names as I take role.

The fifth graders quiet down while the standing children sit
down at their desks.

MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Jenny Anderson?

JENNY raises her hand.

JENNY
Here!

MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Eric Ball?
ERIC
Here.

MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Todd Baxter?

TODD BAXTER
I’m here.

MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Heather Levington?

HEATHER LEVINGTON

Here.

MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Tim Li?

YOUNG TIM
Here!

YOUNG BILLIAM is growing nervous while he begins sinking down

his chair.

Here!

MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Ashley Nelson?

ASHLEY NELSON

MRS. ZIMMERMAN

Laura Rose?

LAURA ROSE
Here!

MRS. ZIMMERMAN
Billiam Williams?

No one knows who YOUNG BILLIAM is but do notice someone sinking
down in his chair. Some laugh at the name. YOUNG TERRENCE finds
it amusing while lightly jokes to his peers. MRS. ZIMMERMAN

looks around.

MRS. ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
Billiam Williams?

YOUNG BILLIAM continues to sink.

CUT TO:

INT. REP’S OFFICE - PRESENT - AFTERNOON

BILLIAM (18) sits across from a well dressed, middle aged
admissions representative. The rep has a note pad in his lap and

a pen in his hand, looking attentively at BILLIAM.

ADMISSIONS REP
So your parents named you Billiam?

BILLIAM
Yeah.

ADMISSIONS REP
Could be worse. I once knew a kid
who’s parents named him Bobert.

BILLIAM
Really?

ADMISSIONS REP
Yeah. (laughs) We mocked the hell
outta that kid! (continues to laugh)

BILLIAM is unamused, and the admissions rep notices this.

ADMISSIONS REP (CONT'D)
(clears his throat)
Sorry. Please, continue.
BILLIAM
Why do you want to know so much
about my childhood?

ADMISSIONS REP
Well, when we ask most people to
talk about their childhood on this
form they at least give us something.
You just wrote “Not Applicable”.

BILLIAM nods slightly.

BILLIAM
(Agreeing) Mmmhmm.

ADMISSIONS REP
Would you really describe your

childhood as “Not applicable”?

BILLIAM opens his mouth as if he’s about to say something,
thinking very hard.

CUT TO:
INT. LUNCH ROOM - FLASHBACK
Subtitle: “2000”
YOUNG BILLIAM sits at a lunchroom table, all alone.
BILLIAM (V.0O)

Back then, kids were (pause) —-

less than civil towards me.
YOUNG BILLIAM suddenly gets hits directly in the face with a
large, sloppy sandwich. Shocked, he wipes the contents of the

sandwich from his face as loud laughter erupts from off screen.

Seated across the lunchroom is YOUNG TERRENCE, the source of the
laughter. YOUNG TERRENCE sits amongst his lackeys.
BILLIAM (V.O) (CONT'D)
Terrence was my constant tormentor.

YOUNG TERRENCE retrieves another sandwich from his paper lunch-
sack.

BILLIAM (V.O) (CONT'D)
And over the years it became quite
apparent to me that Terrence’s
mother stocked him with a steady
supply of sandwiches.
YOUNG TERRENCE begins to happily eat his next sandwich.
CUT TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS

YOUNG BILLIAM sits in class and gets hit with a sandwich in the
back of the head. YOUNG TERRENCE’S laughter erupts behind him.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS

YOUNG BILLIAM stands at the urinal and gets hit with another
sandwich. YOUNG TERRENCE LAUGHS off-screen.

CUT TO:
INT. GYM - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS

YOUNG BILLIAM prepares to catch a kicked ball in the back of the
gym and gets hit with a ball from behind by the laughing unseen
YOUNG TERRENCE.

BILLIAM (V.0O)
Well, c'mon, he couldn't always
throw sandwiches. That's just
ridiculous.
CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS

BILLIAM (V.O.)
But my mother was always there for
me when I got home. And she always
tried to make me feel better about
the situation.

MOTHER
Oh, Billiam.

YOUNG BILLIAM’S mother picks a piece of tomato out of his hair.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
Do you know why the kids do this to

you?

YOUNG BILLIAM
(sniffling) Because my name's Billiam?

MOTHER (CONT'D)
Oh, heavens no. It's because they're
jealous of you.

YOUNG BILLIAM lifts his head, displaying a look of hope.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Really?

His mother nods, smiling. YOUNG BILLIAM smiles back.
CUT TO:
INT. REP’S OFFICE - PRESENT
BILLIAM
What were they jealous of? The

friends I didn’t have? The social
skills I was unable to acquire?
ADMISSIONS REP
Well, your mom sounds like a pretty
smart person. I mean, my mom told
me the same thing, and lI...
(look of realization) Oh..

BILLIAM
The worst part was that I actually
listened to her. (thinks) Wait a minute,
no. That’s not the worst part. The worst
part was...

CUT TO:
INT. CLASSROOM - FLASHBACK

YOUNG BILLIAM walks to his seat, and YOUNG TERRENCE sticks his
foot out to trip him. YOUNG BILLIAM falls with a thud.

YOUNG TIM, who sits all alone in the corner, watches this.

YOUNG BILLIAM comes back to his feet and turns to YOUNG
TERRENCE.

YOUNG BILLIAM
You know what, Terrence? I know
why you pick on me.

YOUNG TERRENCE
Oh, really?

YOUNG BILLIAM

You’re just jealous of me, and you

pick on me because you’re really insecure
YOUNG BILLIAM (CONT’D)

about yourself, and need to make me

feel bad to make yourself feel better.

YOUNG TIM, hearing this, shuts his eyes wincing. YOUNG TERRENCE
pauses as he takes this all in.
YOUNG TERRENCE
(sarcastic) You know what? You're
right. I am jealous of you. All I
really want to be is your friend.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Really?

YOUNG TERRENCE reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sandwich,
throwing it in YOUNG BILLIAM’S face. He walks away, and YOUNG
BILLIAM stands there, shocked.

BILLIAM (V.0O)
My first run-in with sarcasm.

YOUNG TIM shakes his head, getting up from his seat and walking
over to YOUNG BILLIAM. He pulls out some tissues from his pocket
and hands them to YOUNG BILLIAM.

BILLIAM (V.O) (CONT'D)
And that’s when I first met my best
friend, Tim.

YOUNG TIM
He’s not really jealous of you, you
know.

YOUNG BILLIAM
But my mom said he was.

YOUNG TIM
Well, there’s your first problem.
When it comes to bullies, never
listen to your mother.

YOUNG BILLIAM thinks about this.
BILLIAM (V.0O)
He was right. And the more I
thought about it, the more I
remembered all the horrible advice
my mother had given me.

INT. BILLIAM’S LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK

YOUNG BILLIAM is looking up to his mother. She is cutting onions
in the kitchen.

MOTHER
Just ignore them, and they'll stop
picking on you.

CUT TO:

YOUNG BILLIAM is counseled by his mother at the dining room
table.

MOTHER
The next time they pick on you, you
just tell your teacher. She'll make
everything better.

CUT TO:

YOUNG BILLIAM is leaning against the wall in his bathrobe as his
mother talks in the background.

MOTHER (0O.S.)
I think it's time I gave their
parents a call. Once they get a
good talking to, they'll stop
picking on you.

CUT TO:

MOM is tucking in YOUNG BILLIAM in his bed. It is night.
MOM
He won’t bother you anymore, much
like that boogeyman you mentioned
before hiding under your bed.
Goodnight dear.

MOM gets up and walks towards the door. As she does, YOUNG
BILLIAM’s eyes are wide open with a sense of realization of an
old fear. While finding enough courage, he grabs his flashlight,
turns it on, and slowly looks under the bed.

The flashlight shines towards a body under the bed appearing to
be YOUNG TERRENCE. He holds a sandwich in his right hand and
moves it towards him.

YOUNG BILLIAM wakes up in a sweat screaming.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Mom! The boogeyman is Terrence!

INT. REP’S OFFICE - PRESENT

BILLIAM
Her heart was in the right place,
but she just didn't understand what
it was really like. Sure bullies
were probably insecure with
themselves which caused them to
pick on those lesser than them, but
knowing that didn't help as a
little kid. In the end, there are
just no good ways to deal with a bully.

BILLIAM smiles deviously.

BILLIAM (CONT'D)
But there are some bad ones.

INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - FLASHBACK

YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM sit at a lunchroom table, eating.
BILLIAM (V.O.)
Tim and I basically became
inseparable for the next several
months. I’d like to say by that time
I’d taken care of my Terrence situation,
but I can say that things were at least
starting to change.

YOUNG BILLIAM gets hit with a sandwich, which smears across
his face and falls on the table. He remains unfazed.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Hmm. Terrence’s mother switched to
Miracle Whip.

He wipes off his face with a nearby napkin, and continues
eating.

YOUNG TIM
At least she stopped using toothpicks.
(pause) You ever going to stand up to
him?

YOUNG BILLIAM
Well, my mom says I should try not to
give him a big reaction.

YOUNG TIM
Your mom?! You’re still listening to
your mom?! Are you kidding? Nothing
she’s said has worked, Bill! Seriously,
you need to do something. If you don't,
he’1l never stop. EVER!

YOUNG BILLIAM
I know.

YOUNG BILLIAM sits there and thinks to himself.
YOUNG TIM
Someone needs to hit him with a
sandwich.

YOUNG BILLIAM suddenly gets a look of realization across his
face.

YOUNG BILLIAM
I’ve got it.

YOUNG TIM
What?

YOUNG BILLIAM
We're going to settle this on the
playground.

YOUNG TIM looks confused.
EXT. BILLIAM’S HOUSE - FLASHBACK - AFTERNOON

YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM walk out from the back door in a
hurry wearing backpacks filled with sandwiches. Attached to
their pants are walky-talkies. They begin to head towards the
garage until a car door shuts.

YOUNG BILLIAM moves his arm to stop YOUNG TIM from proceeding
further. They hide around the corner from being seen. BILLIAM
peeks and sees his mother walking towards the front door with
bag of groceries.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Civilian hostile spotted.

YOUNG TIM
Should we initiate plan B?

YOUNG BILLIAM turns towards YOUNG TIM.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Affirmative. Get ready.
The boys detach their walky-talkies from their pants and turn
them on.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Tim, your objective is to watch
her every move. You can reach me

on here.

YOUNG TIM
Will do.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Okay. Go!

The boys set ways.

YOUNG BILLIAM’S mother walks into the house. YOUNG BILLIAM makes
his way towards the garage while YOUNG TIM starts sneaking by
the house windows. YOUNG BILLIAM brings the walky-talkie towards
his mouth. His head peeks around the corner for a clear visual.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Tango Lee Seven this is Bravo Whiskey
Six. Radio check, over!

YOUNG TIM
Bravo Whiskey Six, this is Tango
Lima Seven. I read you loud and clear,
over!

YOUNG BILLIAM
Roger, Tango Lee Seven. Give me a
sitrep, over!

YOUNG TIM looks into the window: she is dancing with a cat.

YOUNG TIM
Target is in sight.

YOUNG TIM rolls his eyes and gets back into a hiding position.
YOUNG TIM
Be advised, crazy mom close, over.

YOUNG BILLIAM makes it to the garage and quietly sneaks towards
the garage door. He speaks into the walky-talkie again.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Tango Lima Seven, I’m in position, over.

YOUNG TIM peeks through the window again but does not see her.

YOUNG TIM
All clear, Bravo Whiskey Six. Mission
is a go. I repeat, mission is a go!

YOUNG BILLIAM
Roger, Wilco! Go mission! Over and out!

YOUNG BILLIAM grabs the garage door handle and opens it. He runs
in as YOUNG TIM follows him from behind. They run out with a
ladder, tape, and a long rope.

YOUNG BILLIAM’s mother barely recognizes them just in time as
they slowly run off with a large ladder.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - AFTERNOON

YOUNG BILLIAM is on a ladder as TIM hands him the next backpack
of sandwiches. A rope is attached to a closed net attached to
the hoop. Duck tape is below the hoop in a formation of an ‘xX’.

YOUNG TIM
You sure this is a good idea?

YOUNG BILLIAM
No, I think it’s a bad one! You
want out?

YOUNG TIM
No. I was just thinking of one sandwich.
I think we made a hundred sandwiches!
YOUNG BILLIAM
Revenge is messy. You said it
yourself, Tim. I have to stand up to
Terrence. If I don’t, he’1ll never stop.
I tried telling the teacher. I tried
ignoring him. I tried to look brave. I
tried to pretend I don’t care. But I do
care. It’s time for Terrence to get a
taste of his own medicine.

YOUNG TIM
What if it doesn’t work?

YOUNG BILLIAM
It will work.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - AFTERNOON

YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM stand at the playground to their old
school, waiting. YOUNG TIM glances at his watch.

YOUNG TIM
Maybe he won’t show.

YOUNG BILLIAM
He’1l show.

Suddenly in the distance, YOUNG TERRENCE shows up on his bike.
The scene plays in slow motion. He ride up to the playground and
tosses his bike to the ground, his long coat tails flutter in
the wind (in slow motion a la John Woo). YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG
TIM watch this.

YOUNG TERRENCE approaches the duo.
YOUNG TERRENCE
Well, well, well.. if it isn’t

Billiam Williams.

YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM exchange glances.
YOUNG TERRENCE
And you brought your friend Dim Tim.

YOUNG TIM
Hi Terry.

YOUNG TERRENCE
I got your note. What do you want?

YOUNG BILLIAM
I just want to teach you a lesson.

YOUNG TERRENCE
Oh yeah? And what’s that?

YOUNG BILLIAM
That when someone you’ve tortured
for his entire life asks you to
meet him out in a secluded area-
(pause) you should always watch
where you stand.

YOUNG TERRENCE looks down to find that he is standing on a giant
X. YOUNG BILLIAM pulls a string. YOUNG TERRENCE sees YOUNG
BILLIAM pull the string and looks up as a giant bucket of
sandwiches is released above his head.

A hundred sandwiches fall out of the bucket and fall all over
YOUNG TERRENCE. YOUNG TERRENCE slowly looks up from his feet at
YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM.

YOUNG TERRENCE
You're dead.

As they move forward, YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM start backing
up.

YOUNG TIM
Uh, Bill? What was your plan for
after we hit him with the sandwiches?
YOUNG BILLIAM
That’s about as far as I got.

YOUNG TERRENCE backs them both into a tree, grabbing YOUNG
BILLIAM and raising his fist.

YOUNG TERRENCE
(smiling) I’m really going to
enjoy this.
YOUNG BILLIAM winces, waiting for impact when in the distance a
car engine is heard revving. YOUNG TERRRENCE slowly turns his

head around.

Far in the distance, a silver station wagon sits at the end of
the parking lot. The engine revs again.

YOUNG TERRENCE lets go of his grip and walks towards the car.

YOUNG TERRENCE (CONT'D)
Now, what’s this?

YOUNG TIM
Bill? Is that your mother?

YOUNG BILLIAM simply stares ahead, nodding in shock.

YOUNG TERRENCE squints towards the car to get a better
look. He laughs to himself.

YOUNG TERRENCE
Aww, isn't that cute? Billy called
his mommy to come and save him.
The car engine revs again.
INT. BILLIAM'S MOM'S CAR - DAY
MOTHER

Nobody hurts my boy and gets away
with it.
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

The car suddenly peels forward, towards YOUNG TERRENCE. YOUNG
TERRENCE’s face drops in horror, as he begins to run in the
opposite direction. He runs towards his bike and hops on,
pedaling away.

YOUNG TERRENCE cowardly screams as he drives his bike fast away,
YOUNG BILLIAM’s mother on his tail. They drive off into the
distance and disappear, leaving YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM
alone.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

YOUNG TIM
Wow. (pause) Your mom is insane.

YOUNG BILLIAM smiles, as he stares off to where they drove
off.

YOUNG BILLIAM
Naw, she just loves me.

YOUNG BILLIAM pats YOUNG TIM on the back. They walk off.
CUT TO:
INT. REP’S OFFICE - PRESENT
BILLIAM
And, so that’s how it ended.
Terrence ended up transferring to a
new school, and I really haven’t

seen him since.

The ADMISSION REP places his folder on the table.
ADMISSIONS REP
Well, I must say, that’s one heck
of a story. And I can see why you
didn’t try and fit that into a
single essay.

The ADMISSION REP sticks out his hand.

ADMISSIONS REP (CONT'D)
We’1l let you know.

CUT TO:
INT. LOBBY - PRESENT -CONTINUOUS
BILLIAM walks out into the lobby and looks around to see several

students sitting in a line of chairs. At the front of them is
TERRENCE. He looks up and notices BILLIAM, surprised.

BILLIAM
Terrence?

TERRENCE
Oh hey, Bill.

BILLIAM
You’re going to this school?

TERRENCE
If they let me.

Awkward pause as the two think of what to say.

BILLIAM
Well, good luck Terrence.

TERRENCE
Hey, you too.

BILLIAM begins to walk away.
TERRENCE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Hey Billiam!

BILLIAM shields his face in terror, wincing. He looks back to
see TERRENCE is sticking out his hand, smiling.

TERRENCE (CONT'D)
Good to see you.

BILLIAM shakes TERRENCE’s hand.

BILLIAM
You too.

TERRENCE
Hey, maybe we can get together and
get a bite to eat sometime. No

sandwiches of course. (laughs)

BILLIAM
Yeah, I’d like that.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESTRAUNT - DAY

BILLIAM and TERRENCE are talking to each other as they eat by a
window. Laughs are exchanged as they recall stories.

EXT. ROAD - DAY
BILLIAM walks with TERENCE down the sidewalk.
TERRENCE
It was great seeing you again. My
car is right up there. Where is yours?
BILLIAM

Oh, it’s at the shop. There were some
problems with the engine and had to get
it fixed.

TERRENCE
That sucks, man. Need a ride?

BILLIAM
Uh, my mom is picking me up.

TERRENCE is in shock.

TERRENCE
She's... what?

BILLIAM looks at him questionably.

BILLIAM
She’s picking me up. I told her to
arrive about this time.

BILLIAM glances around.

BILLIAM
She should be here... oh, there
she is.

TERRENCE looks where BILLIAM is looking at. He spots his mother
standing outside the car. Her eyes lock on TERRENCE with an evil
grin.

MOTHER
You!

TERRENCE panics and begins running the opposite direction and
around the corner. BILLIAM is confused and watches him run off.
BILLIAM’S MOTHER gets in the car quickly and turns it on,
storming after TERRENCE.

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
