The upbeat indie-electronic Passion Pit song Little Secrets,
coming from computer speakers in...

INT. SIMON‘'S ROOM - MORNING

We move through this TEENAGE BOY'S BEDROOM, passing relics of
a thoughtful suburban adolescent:

A framed Elliott Smith RECORD COVER.
A half-eaten package of DOUBLE-STUFFED OREOS.

A pile of PROSPECTIVE STUDENT college brochures for big city
schools: NYU, BU, USC.

Stacks of CHUCK KLOSTERMAN BOOKS and NEW YORK MAGAZINES.
So many HOODIES, strewn across pretty much every surface.

Till we land on our hero, SIMON SPIER (17), boyishly handsome
with vibrant blue eyes and a thick mop of unruly hair. He
hurriedly gets ready for school as an old inkjet printer
spits out his English essay.

Simon sits down at his desk to staple his essay, when he’s
distracted by something outside the window:

A SHIRTLESS GARDENER mowing the lawn.

He's a twenty-something guy with the shoulders and the chest
and the one-million abs glistening with just the right amount
of sweat.

Simon’s eyes are locked on the hot gardener. He's clearly
attracted to him.

A KNOCK on the door. Simon spins around just as his father,
JACK (47, loves dad jokes), pokes his head in:

JACK
Hey, Nora made pancakes.

SIMON
Cool. Be down soon.

JACK
And by “soon” do you mean once you
finish searching for pictures of
Gigi Habib in lingerie?

SIMON
It’s Hadid.
JACK
Sorry, didn't realize she was your
girlfriend.

Jack chortles as he closes the door. Clearly he has no idea
Simon is gay. Because Simon is still in the closet.

SIMON
(under his breath)
Yup, you got me.

Simon turns back to the window. But now Hot Gardener is
blocked by his much older, much fatter, also shirtless
COLLEAGUE.

Simon leans over to get a glance at the hot one again. Way
over. Just when he finally has a good view --

WHAM! The desk chair flies out from under him and he falls
out of frame. Hard.

As Passion Pit sings: “Let this be our little secret, no one
needs to know we're feeling...”

CUT TO OUR TITLE:
SIMON VS. THE HOMO SAPIENS AGENDA

The song continues as our MAIN TITLES play over a kinetic
sequence that is Simon’s morning routine:

INT. SIMON’S KITCHEN - MORNING

Jack, Simon’s mom, DENISE (40's, warm and thoughtful), and
his sister, NORA (14, awkward and mumbly) eat pancakes.

Simon bounds through, pulling on his Jansport.

DENISE
Simon, sit. Breakfast is--

SIMON
(teasing)
Please mom, don’t say breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.
It’s so cliché. You’re better than
that.

DENISE
I was going to say breakfast lowers
LDL cholesterol and prevents
fluctuating glucose levels which
can lead to type two diabetes. Is
that cliché?
SIMON
(grinning)
Touché.

Simon grabs a PANCAKE from the stack and takes a large bite.

SIMON (CONT’D)
Nora, this is incredible.

He ruffles Nora’s hair. She blushes and awkwardly mumbles:

NORA
Oh, thanks. They’re cornmeal with
blackberry compote. No big deal.

Simon gives a bite to his GOLDEN RETRIEVER, BIEBER.

SIMON
Here you go, Bieber. Most
important meal of the day.

And Simon‘s gone.
INT. / EXT. SIMON’S OLD HONDA / SIMON’S STREET - DAY
A pretty residential street in the suburbs of Atlanta.

Simon jumps into his car, drives five houses down, and re—
parks.

INT. NICK’S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Simon enters a cozy, finished basement - giant TV, mini
fridge, soccer trophies. The kind of hangout room you wish
you had in high school.

NICK (17, easy jock good locks) snores on an futon. An old
soccer game plays on the TV. Simon pulls off Nick's blanket
and yanks him to his feet.

NICK
(waking up, startled)
Ahh!

SIMON
Homeroom starts in eighteen
minutes.

NICK
Shit. I fell asleep studying
Roberto Baggio’s moves in the ‘94
World Cup.

He glances at the TV. Brazil is celebrating their victory.
NICK (CONT'D)
Damnit. Now I know who won.

Simon grabs a clean TEE from a laundry basket, tosses it to
Nick. Wick pulls it on, then realizes it reads “ATLANTA'S
GREATEST DAD!" Nick shrugs, going with it.

SIMON
Did you buy that for your dad?

NICK
He bought it for himself. It was
at the peak of his mid-life crisis.

They head upstairs, where Nick hurriedly stuffs his SOCCER
CLEATS and SHIN PADS inside a duffel.

NICK (CONT’D)
I was just having the craziest
dream.

SIMON
Nick, you have the “craziest dream”
every night.

NICK
I was in the bathroom putting on my
contacts.

They head out the front door...
EXT. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY

.-where their other best friend, LEAH (17, sensitive, artsy,
makes her own clothes) approaches from her house across the
street. A perfectly choreographed morning routine.

NICK
But I couldn’t figure out which
lens went in which eye--

SIMON
Wait for Leah.

Leah approaches, clocks Nick's dad shirt and bed head.

LEAH
We never should’ve told you about
ESPN Classic.

NICK
Sorry we can’t all make our own
clothes.
(then, re: her outfit)
(MORE)
NICK (CONT'D)
Seriously though, that dress is
really cool. You’re gonna be very
rich one day.

LEAH
Maybe we can collaborate on a
clothing line, like H & M and
Beckham.

NICK
And then Si will write a profile
about us in some fancy magazine.

SIMON
I love how successful we are in the
pretend future.

Leah smiles. They all get into...
INT. / EXT. SIMON’S HONDA / SHADY CREEK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Leah rides shotgun. Nick leans forward from the backseat as
Simon drives them to school.

NICK
So Leah, last night I dreamt I was
in the bathroom putting on my
contacts and I couldn’t figure out
which lens went in which eye--

LEAH
Wait. I have something really
important to tell you guys.

NICK
I’m in the middle of--

SIMON
I pick Leah’s thing. Leah, say
your thing.

LEAH
Last night I was walking past
Jackie Morgan’s house and her
parents were having sex in the hot
tub.

Simon and Nick react with disgust.

LEAH (CONT’D)
Oh. I was happy for them.
{off their surprise)
What?
(MORE)
LEAH (CONT’D)
They’ve been married thirty years
and they haven’t lost their spark.

Simon smiles. He loves the way Leah sees the world.
NICK
Simon, remember when you dated

Jackie?

Simon tenses up ever so slightly.

SIMON
Vaguely. Ninth grade is a long
time ago.

NICK

You'd probably remember it better
if you’d gotten past first base.

SIMON
{forced)
Yup, I tanked it.
NICK
If it were me, I would’ve gotten
all up in there and been like, “Hey
Jackie, I just really wanna...”
Nick MOTORBOATS Leah's neck.

LEAH
Ahh! Get away from me.
(then)
You are such an idiot.

But Leah is grinning. Simon notices. He’s pretty sure she
has a crush on Nick.

The gang pulls into...
EXT. WAFFLE HOUSE DRIVE THROUGH - CONTINUOUS
«.,and Leah leans over Simon to order.

LEAH
Three black iced coffees, please.

SIMON
Wait, get one for Abby.

Leah looks irked at the mention of “Abby.”

LEAH
Four black iced coffees, please.
NICK
Abby likes hers with cream--

LEAH
Three black, one with cream.

NICK
And sugar.

LEAH
And sugar.
(back to Nick, annoyed)
What are you, her barista?

NICK
We've been friends with her for two
months. It’s not that hard to
remember “cream and sugar.”

An uncomfortable silence. Simon cranks up the radio and the
song carries us to:

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LOBBY - DAY

Gossip! Body spray! Hormones! Welcome to Creekwood, a mid-
sized public high school buzzing with students getting ready
for class.

Simon, Leah, and Nick enter with their coffees.

ABBY (17) runs up to them. She is black, gorgeous, and
rocking a very cool beat up leather jacket and boots.

ABBY
Hey, guys.

NICK
Hey, Abby.

And judging by the dumb grin on his face, Nick is totally
into her.

SIMON
We got you a coffee.

NICK
Cream and: sugar.

ABBY
Oh, you guys are the best. I am
figuratively dying.

Leah forces a smile. Simon notices, very aware of the
tension brewing in his friend group.
ABBY (CONT’D)
Have you guys looked at the
Creeksecrets Tumblr today?

SIMON
No, what'd we miss?

As Abby takes out her phone and calls up the website:

ABBY
At my old school, if there was a
website just for school gossip,
someone definitely would’ve gotten
stabbed.

Simon laughs, then falls silent as he realizes:

SIMON
Oh, you're serious.

Abby hands her phone to Simon. It’s displaying a Tumblr
where students can anonymously post the most salacious
happenings at Creekwood High School.

SIMON (CONT'D)
(reading)

Becca Peterson got caught giving

Ryan O'Donovan a handjob in the

pool. That’s the real reason they

had to drain it.

Simon holds up the phone which displays a photo of an ANGRY
JANITOR draining the CREEKWOOD HIGH POOL.

Everyone reacts, joyously disgusted.

SIMON (CONT'D)
Janitor Rick deserves a raise.

NICK
So Abby, last night I dreamt I put
the wrong contacts in my eyes.

Leah and Simon GROAN. Abby is charmed.

ABBY
We're analyzing another dream?
You’re like the love child of
Sigmund Freud and Christiano
Ronaldo.

NICK
{very proud)
Thank you.
(MORE)
NICK (CONT'D)
(then, back to dream
So I can’t see anything. I’m
stumbling around the bathroom,
crashing into everything. And then
I wake up.

SIMON
That’s it? That’s what you've been
trying to tell us all morning?

NICK
I’m pretty sure it means there’s
something I’m not seeing clearly.
Something that’s right in front of
me. What do you guys think?

Simon and Leah look uncomfortable.

LEAH SIMON
I dunno, No idea.

Simon nervously takes a sip of his iced coffee.
INT. SPIER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Simon, Nora, and their parents eat Indian takeout as they
watch the end of ABC’s The Bachelorette, A family ritual.

Videochatting in from her dorm on an iPad is Simon’s older
sister ALICE (18) in a BARD COLLEGE SWEATSHIRT.

SIMON
There is no way they went into the
fantasy suite just to give each
other “foot massages.”

JACK
Seriously. How dumb do they think
we are?

ALICE

I dunnc. Cody is from Utah, which
is super Mormon and virgin-y.

NORA
Virginal.

SIMON
You'd know.

NORA
So would you.

Simon shuts up,
10.

DENISE
Even if they did more than foot
massages, it doesn’t mean they made
love.

All three kids GROAN.

DENISE (CONT’D)
Oh my god, you guys are so
repressed-—

SIMON
Don’t therapize us. We’re not your
patients.

DENISE
Oh, I know. If you were my
patients, you'd be way more well-
adjusted.

JACK
Nice therapist burn, baby.

They fist bump.

DENISE
(to Alice)
How’s our own little college
bachelorette doing? Any special

someones?

ALICE
Ew, no, I’m not talking about my
life.

JACK

We raised a vault, honey.

ALICE
(back to the show)
I think she’s gonna pick Daniel F.
He's the hottest one.

JACK
The gay one?

NORA
Daniel’s not gay.

JACK
Look at that haircut. The guy is a
one-man Pride Parade.
{singing)
It's fun to stay at the Y-M-C-A.
il.

This is Jack’s sense of humor. Bad and out-of-touch, but not
malicious. Still, Simon tenses up.

ALICE
Dad, stop.
JACK ALICE (CONT'D)
It's fun to stay at the Y-M-C- Would you cut it out? That
Bees is so offensive. You don’t
(then, quickly) even realize how pervasive
With Daniel F! It's fun to your casual heterosexism is!

stay at the Y-M-C-A.

Alice continues to throw around words she’s learned in her
gender studies class. Denise and Nora laugh a little in
spite of themselves.

And no one notices Simon, wildly uncomfortable.

The opening chords of ELLIOTT SMITH'S “WALTZ #2” kick in,
taking us to...

INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT

.--where Simon listens to Elliott Smith as he scans the
latest CREEKSECRETS TUMBLR gossip: a stuffed bra-gate, a
Lacrosse player caught getting head under the bleachers. The
usual.

He’s about to close the site when a POST catches his eye.
It’s a stock photo of a FERRIS WHEEL accompanied by a short
entry.

We hear SIMON’S VOICE in his head as he reads the text:

SIMON (V.0.)

Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck on
a ferris wheel. One minute I’m on
top of the world, the next I’m at
rock bottom. Over and over, all
day long. Because a lot about my
life is great. But nobody knows
I’m gay-

It's signed with only the pseudonym: Blue.

Simon sits back, stunned. fhere’s another secretly gay kid
at Creekwood?

He considers for a beat, then navigates to Gmail and
REGISTERS FOR A NEW E-MAIL ACCOUNT.

Gmail asks for a USERNAME. Simon considers as Elliott Smith
sings: “I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note.”
12.

So, Simon signs up for hourtohour.notetonote@gmail.com.
Available!

He clicks back to the CREEKSECRETS ENTRY, and comments: I can
relate.

He ponders a pseudonym for himself, then notices a FRAMED
PHOTO of his family in Paris’s Luxembourg Park when he was a
little boy. Something about this photo makes him decide to
sign his comment Jacques.

And then he adds the new e-mail address beneath his comment
so “Blue” can reach him.

Simon hesitates for a moment, then hits POST. Off his face,
excited and terrified...

CUT TO BLACK.

INT. SIMON’S ROOM —- MORNING

Simon wakes up. Instantly picks up his phone and checks his
“hourtohour” Gmail account: ONE NEW MESSAGE!

He can’t open the inbox fast enough. But it’s just the
stupid AUTOMATED MESSAGE Gmail sends when you open an
account.

And thus begins Simon’s EXCRUCIATING SCHOOL DAY waiting for
Blue to respond.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - MATH CLASS -— MORNING
CLOSE ON a NO CELL PHONES poster.

Simon and his CLASS sit in agony as a MATH TEACHER
desperately tries to get them excited about geometric proofs.

MATH TEACHER
»-eand we know this side here is
twelve inches. So how do we
determine the length of side A?

He is met with a roomful of BORED, VAGUELY HOSTILE STARES.
Finally, Simon raises his hand.

MATH TEACHER (CONT'D)
Yes! Simon!

SIMON
May I go to the bathroom?
13.

The Math Teacher deflates, silently wishing he became an
engineer.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - BOYS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Simon locks himself in a stall. Takes out his phone. still
NO NEW MESSAGES.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA ~- LATER

Simon sits at lunch with Nick, Abby, Leah and a couple of
Nick’s soccer friends, BRAM (handsome, with olive skin and
dark brown eyes) and GARRETT (affable jock). Simon
compulsively hits refresh on his phone, but he has no signal.

GARRETT
Did you guys see that Creeksecrets
post last night with the ferris
wheel picture? Who do you think is
gay?

This gets Simon’s attention. He looks up from his phone,
tries to keep his expression neutral.

ABBY
(shrugs)
Who cares? It’s 2016.

GARRETT
(immediately defensive)
I don’t care. I was just curious.
I love gay people. My dad’s
assistant is gay!

BRAM
(fake impressed)
Wow, your dad’s assistant? How
have you not gotten a GLAAD award
yet?

Everyone LAUGHS, including Simon. He takes in Bram, gets a
little lost in his dark brown eyes. Bram catches Simon
staring at him and misunderstands:

BRAM (CONT’D)
You want some of my fries?

Simon blushes, but quickly covers:

SIMON
Um, yeah. Thanks.

Clearly Simon’s got a crush.
14.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

Simon refreshes his e-mail while hurrying to his next class.
And thus, he CRASHES right into the Vice Principal, MR. WORTH
(30's). He’s one of those administrators who desperately
wants to be friends with his students.

MR. WORTH
Simon, buddy, you know there’s no
texting in the halls.

SIMON
I know, I just--
MR. WORTH
You know I love you.
SIMON
You do?
MR. WORTH

But a rule’s a rule. I have to
confiscate the phone. You can pick
it up after play rehearsal, ‘kay?

Simon reluctantly hands over his phone as we PRELAP Oliver’s
You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - AFTER SCHOOL

Simon, Abby, and the CAST OF OLIVER perform a very sloppy run-
through. The harmonies are off, the choreography is a mess,
and actors keep crashing into each other.

Simon plays one of the Orphans. Abby is the Artful Dodger.

MARTIN (17, oddball class clown in a pun t-shirt that says
“TRONY, THE OPPOSITE OF WRINKLY”) is Fagin.

MARTIN
You've got to pick a pocket or two,
boooooys. You've got to pick a
pocket or twooooocce!

MS. ALBRIGHT (30's, no-bullshit drama teacher) and CAL (17,
indie-dreamy stage manager) give a weak round of applause.

MS. ALBRIGHT
Okay, that was... help me, Cal.

cAL
That was a start.
15.

MS. ALBRIGHT
That was a start!

Simon leans over and anxiously whispers to Abby:

SIMON
What time is it?

ABBY
Ten minutes later than the last
time you asked me.

TAYLOR, the type-A blonde Senior girl playing Oliver, raises
her hand.

MS. ALBRIGHT
Yes, Taylor?

TAYLOR
Um, I was pretty singularly focused
on being Oliver but I could still
tell that sucked. Jake and
Samantha were practically dry
humping the entire time.

ANGLE ON two entwined TEENS playing Fagin’s Boys. They have
their hands in each other’s back pockets.

MS. ALBRIGHT
Point taken. Let’s try and put
aside our steamy personal lives
when we’re in character, shall we?

Jake and Samantha reluctantly remove their hands from each
other’s pockets.

CAL
From the top, people!

Everyone GRUMBLES as they take their places.

SIMON
What time is it now?

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - MR. WORTH’S OFFICE - DAY
Simon enters Mr. Worth’s office, dying to get his phone back.

SIMON
Hi, I’m here for my phone.

Mr. Worth reaches into his desk, takes out Simon’s phone.
16.

MR. WORTH
I hope you enjoyed your time being
“disconnected.” We depend so much
on our devices these days.

SIMON
(dying)
Yup. Totally.

MR. WORTH
I know I can't go a few hours
without checking my Insta or
playing a little Angry Birds.

Simon is going crazy.

SIMON
Mhmm. It’s a struggle.

Finally, Mr. Worth hands over the phone. Simon checks the
little mail icon: one new e-mail!

INT. / EXT. SIMON’S HONDA / CREEKWOOD PARKING LOT - DAY

Simon gets in his car, takes out his phone, and opens the e-
mail. It’s from bluegreen118@gmail.con.

As Simon reads, he imagines...

CUT TO:
INT. TEEN BOY’S BEDROOM - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)

A suburban bedroom with distinctive NAVY BLUE WALLS. It
belongs to a MYSTERIOUS TEEN BOY writing an e-mail to Simon.

He is shot from behind so we never see his face. This is
BLUE as Simon imagines him. He has a warm, intelligent
voice.

BLUE (V.0.)
You can relate? I guess that means
you’re either gay or you’re stuck
on a ferris wheel. And I have a
Google alert for carnival mishaps,
so I know it’s not the latter.
When did you know? And have you
told anyone? Blue.

BACK TO REALITY:
INT. / EXT. SIMON’S HONDA / CREEKWOOD PARKING LOT - DAY

Simon stares at the e-mail, totally exhilarated till--
17.

HONK, HONK! He realizes someone is waiting for his spot.

SIMON
Sorry! I’m leaving.

INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Simon rushes in and opens his laptop to respond to Blue. We
hear his voice as he types:

SIMON (V.0.)
No, Blue. I haven’t told anyone.
And honestly, I can’t even really
explain why. I know deep down my
family would be fine with it.

cUT TO:
EXT. SIMON’S HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Denise and Jack struggle mightily to stake a HILLARY sign in
their yard. They give up and lean it against a bush.

SIMON (V.0.)
Both my parents voted for Hillary.

INT. CHURCH ~ DAY (FLASHBACK)

Simon and his family sit in a pew during Sunday mass.
They're hot and bored.

SIMON (V.0.)
And we only go to church when my
grandma comes to town.

REVEAL their GRANDMA, listening te the sermon, rapt. Denise
nudges Jack awake.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA —- DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)

Simon gets lunch with his friends. A couple of JOCKS do that
BLOW JOB GESTURE at him. Leah flips them off.

SIMON (V.0.)
I’m sure a few dicks from school
would give me hell because half of
Shady Creek is still stuck in the
1950's. But my friends would be
fine with it.

BACK TO REALITY:
18.

INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
Simon continues writing the e-mail.

SIMON (V.0.)

So I guess I’1l ruminate on what's
stopping me and get back to you on
it. Ruminate. Pretty good word,
huh?

(beat, then)
As for how I knew I was gay, it was
a bunch of little things...

CUT TO:
INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
TWEEN SIMON (12) sleeps soundly in bed.
SIMON (V.0.)
..-Like this weird dream I had
about Daniel Radcliffe.

Tween Simon wakes up and looks at a Harry Potter poster on
his wall, surprised.

INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
SIMON (V.0.}
And then proceeded to have every
night for a month.

An exasperated Tween Simon takes down the Harry Potter poster
and stuffs it in the trash.

INT. PASSION PIT CONCERT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Tween Simon and Alice bop their heads as PASSION PIT sings.
SIMON (V.0.)
Or how I was obsessed with Passion

Pit in middle school...

He stares at the lead singer, MICHAEL ANGELAKOS, transfixed
by his scruffy good looks.

SIMON (V.0O.)
And then I realized it wasn’t
really about the music.

INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL DANCE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Tween Simon awkwardly slow dances with his pretty, EXTREMELY
DEVELOPED 7TH GRADE GIRLFRIEND.
19.

SIMON (V.0.)
And then there was my first
girlfriend.
SIMON’S FIRST GIRLFRIEND leans in and whispers to Simon:
SIMON’S FIRST GIRLFRIEND
I think I’m falling in love with
you.

TWEEN SIMON
Wow. Uh, I’1l be right back.

Tween Simon darts out of the gymnasium, leaving his confused
gixlfriend staring after him.

INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Tween Simon crouches on a toilet so no one can see his feet,
and texts his mom: Come pick me up. Kids are drinking
alcohol.

SIMON (V.0.)
It wasn’t my proudest moment.

BACK TO REALITY:
INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM —- AFTERNOON
Simon finishes up his e-mail to Blue.

SIMON (V.0.)
How about you? How did you know?

Simon considers how to sign his e-mail.

SIMON (¥.0.)
Warmly, Jacques.
(ech)
Fondly, Jacques.
(nope)
Jacques.

Satisfied, Simon hits SEND.
INT. SIMON’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Nora serves Simon, Denise, and Jack STUFFED PEPPERS that
would be right at home in a Michelin star restaurant.
20.

JACK
So after we finish installing all
the shower tiles, she decides the
black and white checks are “too
black and white.”

NORA
(timid)
These are peppers stuffed with
barley and cremini mushrooms,
dusted with parmesan breadcrumbs.

JACK
(big bite, net discerning)
Tastes great, Nor.
(then, back into it)
So now she wants marble. It’s not
even the master bath!

Simon’s PHONE BUZZES: one new e-mail. He jumps up without
thinking. Then:

SIMON
Great story, dad. We're out of
Sprite. There’s a bottle in the
basement, so...

And he’s gone.
INT. SIMON‘S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Simon stands in front of a storage shelf holding a two liter
of Sprite and reading an e-mail from Blue.

BLUE (V.0.)
Jacques, don’t worry. If your
proudest moment happened in middle
school that would be pretty sad.
(then)
For me, I realized I liked guys
watching Game of Thrones.

INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Simon is sprawled in front of his laptop watching a TV SHOW.

BLUE (V.0.)
My friends were all holding their
breaths waiting to see the Dragon
Princess's boobs. I was crushing
hard on Jon Snow.

REVEAL Simon is watching an early Game of Thrones episode.
Kit Harrington’s hair looks super dreamy. Simon gets it.
21.

BLUE (V.0.)
Wow. I’ve never told that to
anyone before.

Simon smiles, touched that Blue has confided in him. He
clicks over to Gmail and replies to Blue:

SIMON (V.0.)
Well, I’ve never told anyone about
my Daniel Radcliffe phase, so now
we're even. And for the record, I
think this Jon Snow guy is an
excellent choice for your sexual
awakening. I wish we'd started e-
mailing a month ago, I totally
would’ve been him for Halloween.
But people probably would‘ve just
thought I was the singer Lorde.
Who did you dress up as?

Simon hits SEND.
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL —- HALLS - THE NEXT MORNING

Simon, Nick, Abby, and Leah fight their way through the crush
of kids heading to homeroom. Simon takes in the HUNDREDS OF
MALE CREEKWOOD STUDENTS.

QUICK CUTS of FACE after FACE after FACE, faster and faster
and faster. Titerally any one of them could be Blue.

They pass a CUTE DORKY GUY putting books in his locker,
Simon notices the guy has a Game of Thrones poster taped
inside it.

Just as Simon is wondering if he could be Blue, he passes
another guy wearing a Game of Thrones t-shirt. Hopeless.

Simon goes to take out his phone when he spots Mr. Worth
approaching. He pockets the phone, splits away from his
friends, and enters:

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY

He sits down at a computer and eagerly logs into his
“notetonote” Gmail, where he finds a new message from Blue.

BLUE (V.0.)
I didn’t dress up this year. For
me, Halloween is really all about
the Reese’s.
22.

Simon scrolls down to find a phote attached to the e-mail.
It’s LORDE'S HEAD Photoshopped onto JON SNOW’S SHIRTLESS
BODY. Simon laughs.

BLUE (V.0.)
Here’s a mock-up of your Halloween
costume for next year. You’re
welcome. Blue.

Simon sits with a DAZED SMILE. The Librarian passes by...

LIBRARIAN
You certainly look happy today, Mr.
Spier.

Simon immediately stops smiling. Once the Librarian is far
enough away, he Google images a photo of a HUGE PILE OF
REESE’S CUPS and drags it into the e-mail.

The BELL rings.

LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
Everybody get to homeroom!

Simon hurriedly writes:

SIMON (V.0.)
Reese’s are better than sex.

LIBRARIAN
(to Simon)
That means you, Smiley.

Simon sends the e-mail and hurries off to class.
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Simon tears into a pack of REESE’S CUPS at lunch with his
friends. Bram sits down with his tray.

BRAM
(re: Reese’s)
Man, I love those.

Simon looks from his Reese’s to Bram. He’s stunned. Could
his totally unattainable soccer crush be Blue?

BRAM (CONT'D)
So, good news. My aunt’s boyfriend
just took off with her car and all
her jewelry--

GARRETT
Dude, that’s terrible!
23.

BRAM
I know. But this is the third time
it’s happened. She has really bad
taste in guys. My mom is going
down to Orlando to deal with it
which means I get to throw a party.

He flashes them all a shy smile. Simon smiles back, totally
charmed by Bram’s enthusiasm.

GARRETT
Aw, sweetness! Thank you Bram’s
stupid aunt! Let’s get a mini keg.
No, two mini kegs.

NICK
Why don’t we just get a regular
keg?

GARRETT

Yes! And a vodka luge!

As Garrett continues to ramble on excitedly, Simon can’t help
but feel like Bram’s eyes are lingering on him. Off Simon,
unsure...

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Simon sits in class, sneakily reading a new Blue e-mail on
his phone. He now imagines Bram’s voice narrating.

BRAM (V.0.)
Really, Jacques? Reese’s are
better than sex? I’m not speaking
from experience, but I sincerely
hope you're wrong.

cUT TO:
INT. BRAM’S BEDROOM - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)

We're in the same, blue-walled bedroom, but now it belongs to
Bram. Because Blue is now Bram in Simon’s mind.

A shirtless Bram speaks directly to camera. He licks some
melted chocolate off his fingers.

BRAM
Although if sex is chocolatey, and
salty, and sweet...
(signature shy smile)
I guess that wouldn’t be too bad...

BACK TO REALITY:
24.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - DAY
Simon shifts in his seat, trying to hide his boner.
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY
The Oliver cast build sets and hang lights. Taylor
approaches Simon and Abby who are painting a backdrop of
London.

TAYLOR

Do you guys think I should cut my
hair short to play Oliver?

ABBY
Aren't you wearing a hat the entire
time?

TAYLOR

Yeah, but I read that when Daniel
Day Lewis played that paralyzed guy
in My Left Foot he made the crew
carry him around and feed him with
a little spoon.

Abby and Simon stare at Taylor. After a moment:

ABBY
In that case, yeah. You should cut
your hair.

TAYLOR
{instantly panicked)
Really? My hair is kind of my
thing.

SIMON
(has to get away from her)
I’m gonna get some more paint.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DRAMA SUPPLY CLOSET - DAY

Simon rummages through the shelves looking for the right can
of paint.

MARTIN (0.S.}
Simon?

Simon whirls around, startled. Martin (our pun-shirted
Fagin) stands behind him with a strange, nervous look.

SIMON
Jesus, Martin. You scared me.
What’s up?
25.

MARTIN
I used the computer in the library
vight after you.

SIMON
(confused)
Okay?

Martin shuffles awkwardly. Then:

MARTIN
When I went to Gmail, it pulled up
your account. And I read some of
your e-mails. I shouldn’t have
done it, but they were all just
like, right there.

Simon stares at Martin, his mind racing as he realizes Martin
now knows he’s gay.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
It'll probably interest you to know
my brother is gay.
Simon struggles to keep his voice from trembling.
SIMON
No, Martin. That does not interest
me to know.
Simon takes his paint and turns to go.
MARTIN
Simon, calm down. I’m not going to
show anyone.

Simon stops, turns back around to face Martin.

SIMON
Show anyone what?

Martin can’t meet Simon’s eyes. Simon starts to panic.

SIMON (CONT'D)
Did you print my e-mails or

something?
MARTIN

No, I... took a screenshot.
SIMON

Why the hell would you take a
screenshot of my e-mails?
26.

Martin does his awkward shuffle again.

MARTIN
You and Abby Suso are like, best
friends, right?

SIMON
We're friends, we're not best
friends. What does that have to do
with anything?

MARTIN
I need you to... help me talk to
her. And to, y'know, hang out with

her.

SIMON
What? Why would I help you do
that?

Martin stares at Simon, not wanting to say it.

SIMON (CONT'D)
Oh my god. Are you blackmailing
me?

MARTIN
Don’t be so dramatic. It’s not
like that. I just like her and I
need your help.

SIMON
And what if I say no? You’ll tell
the whole school I’m gay? You’ll
leak my e-mails? Post them on
Creeksecrets?

Martin doesn’t respond. Simon realizes that’s exactly what
Martin will do. Finally, Martin speaks.

MARTIN
I think we’re in a position to help
each other out is all. Just think
about it.

Martin walks out, leaving a spiraling Simon in his wake.
INT. / EXT. SIMON’S CAR / SHADY CREEK STREET - DAY
Simon drives home in a daze. He blows a stop sign and

doesn’t even notice till someone HONKS at him. Simon
gestures a vacant apology.
27.

INT. SIMON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN — NIGHT

Family dinner. Simon stares off into space as Jack, Denise,
and Nora laugh and swap stories. Their voices sound A
MILLION MILES AWAY.

EXT. SIMON’S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
Simon walks Bieber. Suddenly, he starts to SPRINT.

He runs until his lungs are burning. He falls to his knees,
gasping for air.

Bieber licks his face, oblivious.
INT. SIMON’S ROOM - MORNING

Simon’s ALARM goes off. He wakes with a start. And then,
yesterday's events come rushing back to him.

SIMON
Shit.

Simon checks his phone: a new e-mail from Blue. He begins to
read it...

BRAM (V.0.)
Jacques, I have to get something
off my chest. The other day you
asked me who I was for Halloween
and I told you I didn’t dress up.
I lied.

Simon straightens up, worried about where this is going.

BRAM (V.0.)
The truth is, I didn’t want you to
know my costume. If you did, you
could just click through Facebook
photos and figure out who I am.

CUT TO:
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)
Simon, Leah, Nick and Abby walk down the hall in SLOW MO.

BRAM (V.0.)
Right now these e-mails feel like
this totally safe place where I can
tell you anything. And they won’t
feel that way anymore if we know
each other’s identities. I’m just
not ready.
28.

They pass Bram and his SOCCER BUDDIES. Simon and Bram stare
straight ahead, ignoring each other.
BRAM {(V.0.)
Do you ever feel locked in your own
body? Like there are things you
are absolutely dying to do and
says

Suddenly, Bram turns around and begins to run towards Simon.
But before he reaches him he stops, FROZEN.

BRAM (V.0.)
But for some reason, you just
can’t?
BACK TO REALITY:
INT. SIMON‘’S ROOM —- MORNING
Simon sighs. He imagines...
CUT TO:
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH ~ DRAMA CLOSET - DAY (SIMON‘’S FANTASY)
We're back in the moment where Martin blackmailed Simon.
MARTIN
It‘1l probably interest you to
know, my brother is gay.

Simon stares at Martin for a beat.

Then, Simon does what he’s dying to do: he PUNCHES Martin
right in the face. For a brief moment, he is triumphant.

But then, his fist moves backwards as if in REWIND. Martin
gets up, rights himself. And Simon says what he actually
said:
SIMON
No Martin. That does not interest
me to know.
BACK TOC REALITY:
INT. SIMON’S ROOM - MORNING
Simon writes back to Blue.
SIMON {V.0.)

Yes, Blue. I know just what you
mean.
29.

Simon hits SEND.
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKERS - DAY

Simon watches from afar as Martin struggles to close his
locker which is overflowing with old gym clothes and empty
soda cans. Martin pulls out a very questionable sandwich,
considers eating it.

Simon approaches.

SIMON
If you want me to help you get with
Abby, you cannot eat that.

MARTIN
80 you're going to help me?

SIMON
Yes.

Martin instantly warms up, as if he wasn’t blackmailing Simon
in a supply closet just yesterday.

MARTIN
This is awesome! I really think
Abby and I are meant to be.

SIMON
(dryly)
Really? Do you?

MARTIN
Not everything is about looks,
Simon.

SIMON
So you’re banking on your great,
blackmail-y personality getting the
job done?

MARTIN
That's hurtful.

SIMON
Don't care. Do you want to come
with us to Bram’s party this
weekend?

Martin lights up.
30.

MARTIN
I love it. It’s so simple. I bet
that’s why they call you Simple
Simon.

SIMON
No one calls me that, Martin.

Simon turns to leave. Martin goes to take a bite of his old
sandwich.

SIMON (CONT’D)
Don’t eat that sandwich, Martin.

INT. NICK'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Simon and his friends are sprawled out, snacking on chips and
drinking sodas pre-Bram’s party.

LEAH
When should we head to Bram’s?

ABBY
Let’s give it an hour. We don’t
want to get there when it’s just
Bram and the soccer dweebs.

NICK
Hey! I'm one of the soccer dweebs.

ABBY
Oh, I know. If I have to listen to
you brag about your epic bicycle
kick one more time--

Nick throws a pillow at Abby and she shrieks.
NICK
Do you even know what a bicycle
kick is? It’s insanely difficult
to execute!
Simon clocks Leah’s discomfort as Nick and Abby flirt.
SIMON
Leah, let's go make those frozen
pizzas.
INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Simon and Leah pull Trader Joe's pizzas out of the oven.

SIMON
Excited for the party?
31.

LEAH
You mean am I excited to stand
amongst our sweaty peers, be too
self-conscious te dance and
pretend to like the taste of beer?
(beat, obvious lying)
Totally!

SIMON
Why would you be self-conscious?
You're like the coolest person in
our school.

Leah snorts like, “as if.”

SIMON (CONT’D)
I’m serious. Look at you.

Simon drags her over to a wall mirror and they both take in
her stylish, homemade outfit.

SIMON (CONT'D)
You’re like, effortlessly cool.

LEAH
I’m pretty sure you're the only
person that feels that way.

SIMON
Well, it’s true. Ever since you
made yourself that macaroni
headband in kindergarten, you’ve
been a trendsetter.

LEAH
Also known as the day you had to go
to the hospital.

SIMON
Yup. Nick told me if I shoved the
macaroni deep enough in my nose a
mac and cheese tree would grow out
of my head. He was very
convincing.

Leah grins. After a moment:

LEAH
I’m sorry I’ve been weird lately.

SIMON
I get it. It’s been just you, me,
and Nick for so long. And now
Abby‘s here.

(MORE )
32.
SIMON (CONT'D)
(gently, for Leah)
It's different.

Leah stares at him. It seems like she wants to say more. But
the moment is interrupted by the DOORBELL.

INT. NICK’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Simon and Leah enter as Nick and Abby come upstairs.

NICK
Who's that?

SIMON
I invited Martin.

ABBY
Martin Addison?

NICK
Why?

SIMON

(barely selling it)
He’s cool.

Simon opens the door to reveal Martin wearing one of his
iconic pun shirts (this one says I'M A FUNGI with a picture
of a MUSHROOM IN SUNGLASSES.) He’s not even cool adjacent.

MARTIN
Evening, Spier. Ready to party?

Simon stares at Martin’s shirt, perturbed.
INT. / EXT. LEAH'S CAR / SHADY CREEK STREETS - NIGHT

Leah drives with Simon riding shotgun. Abby is sandwiched
between Nick and Martin in the back. She scrolls through
Spotify on her phone.

NICK
Would you just pick a song already!

ABBY
(laughing)
It’s hard! There are so many
choices.

Martin sees an opening to connect with Abby...

MARTIN
You should see me try and choose a
film on Netflix.

(MORE)
33.

MARTIN (CONT'D)
Am I feeling like Apatow or am I in
a Billy Wilder mood? Not like you
have to be in a mood for the genius
ef Billy--

NICK
{ignoring Martin)
Just put on Drake! You're black,
I’ve been to Canada. A little
something for everybody.

Abby laughs. As they continue to flirt, Martin mumbles to
himself.

MARTIN
«--sometimes if I can’t decide I
watch Knocked Up and Sunset
Boulevard.

Simon shakes his head. This is not going well for Martin.
EXT. BRAM’S STREET - NIGHT

Everyone gets out of the car and walks toward Bram’s. As the
gang charges towards the party, Martin pulls Simon aside.

MARTIN
What the hell, Spier? Nick won't
stop flirting with Abby.

SIMON
I don‘t know what to tell you.

MARTIN
{annoyed)
Tell me you‘ll make him stop.

SIMON
How am I supposed to--

But Martin is already hurrying after Abby. Simon sighs.
INT. BRAM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A who's who of the Junior class dancing, flirting, and
drinking very cheap flavored vodka.

Simon, Nick, and Leah enter trailed by Martin who regales
Abby with more hyper-specific conversation:

MARTIN
---but I think Gilda Radner was the
greatest SNL member of all time.
34.

ABBY
(polite)
Wow, you know a lot about sketch
comedy.

Abby spots a friend across the party.

ABBY (CONT’D)
Chloe, hi!

Abby takes Leah's hand and drags her away with her. Martin
considers for a moment. Then he follows after the girls.

Bram approaches Simon and Nick. Simon automatically smooths
down his hair nervously.

NICK
This party is crazy!

BRAM
I know. I invited like fifteen
people. And then Garrett invited
the rest of the school. I think
most of these people think we're at
his house.

ACROSS THE ROOM, a drunk Garrett karaokes to Beyoncé.
GARRETT
What's worse, looking jealous or

crazy? Jealous or crazy?

RANDOM KID
Great party, Garrett!

GARRETT
Thanks, Benji!

BACK ON Simon, Nick, and Bram:

NICK
How about a shot? To your party.

SIMON
And your aunt finding a man who
isn’t a con artist.

Bram smiles. Nick grabs a bottle of FIREBALL WHISKEY and
pours TWO SHOTS, assuming Simon doesn’t want one.

SIMON (CONT’D)
Uh, I‘1l have one too.
35.

NICK
(surprised)
Really? You couldn’t even finish a
glass of Manischewitz at Leah’s
seder.

SIMON
Just give me the shot, Nick.

BRAM
I've found it helps not to breathe
through your nose until it’s all
the way down. Then you pretend you
loved it and go “whooo!”

Simon nods, grateful for Bram’s candor. Nick hands Simon a
shot glass. They all down their shots. There’s a CRASH in
the next room.

BRAM (CONT'D)
Oh god, I hope that wasn’t one of
my mom's porcelain owls. She does
not have a sense of humor about
those.

He hurries into the crowd. Simon stares after him.
EXT. BRAM’S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Simon and Nick step out onto a deck overlocking PARTYGOERS in
the yard below.

Nick can’t take his eyes off of Abby, who whips and nae naes
with a group of GIRLS. Including Leah, who awkwardly snaps
her fingers to the music, trying her best to cut loose.

NICK
Abby is so hot it’s insane.

SIMON
Yeah, she’s... unstoppable.

Suddenly, Nick looks worried.

NICK
Wait, you’re not, like, into her,
are you?

SIMON
Nah. She’s hot but she’s not, uh,
my type-

{then, quickly)
Not because she’s black. I love
black women.
(MORE)
SIMON (CONT'D)
Not like, I have a thing for black
women. I just love all women.

36.

Simon grimaces at his awkwardness. But Nick doesn’t notice.

NICK

The other day, she missed her bus
to stay and help me make a list of
all the colleges that have soccer
scholarships. And she’s the only
person whose eyes don’t glaze over
when I recap my dreams.

{resolved)
I‘m gonna ask her out.

Shit. Simon glances down at Martin, desperately trying to
dance with Abby. She’s focused on her circle of girlfriends

and has no idea that he's even there.

Simon can’t let Nick get in the way of Martin's pursuit of

Abby. So...

SIMON
You can't ask Abby out.

NICK
(surprised)
Why not?

SIMON
Because...

Simon racks his brain for a reason. Unfortunately, the only

one he can think of is a lie.

SIMON (CONT'D)
Look. At her old school, Abby had
kind of a reputation.

NICK
What kind of reputation?

SIMON
For being... experienced. She
hooked up with a ton of guys.

NICK
Oh. I didn’t know that.
SIMON
And have you seen her old Facebook

photos?
(MORE)
37.

SIMON (CONT'D)
It’s like everyone at that school
was a seven foot tall black dude.
So she probably has very high
standards... sexually.

NICK
But I’ve only had sex once.

SIMON
(meaningfully)
I know.

NICK
And I could barely figure out where
my dick went.

SIMON
(gravely)
I know.

NICK
I mean, I knew where it went, but
no one tells you how dark it’s
gonna be. Or how slippery
everything gets. And how parts
that you think are the right parts
are actually the other parts. And
then by the time I figured it out,
it was over.

SIMON
I think she’s used to guys who know
which parts are the right parts.

NICK
(hating himself)
I don’t blame her.

SIMON
Don’t tell her I told you about how
many guys she’s been with, okay?
She’d be super embarrassed.

NICK
Yeah, of course.
(overwhelmed)
I'm gonna go get another drink.

Simon watches Nick go, then glances down at Abby, happily
dancing. He feels like shit.
38.

EXT. BRAM’S BACKYARD - LATER

Simon comes down from the deck onto the lawn where Bram is
setting up a BEER PONG TABLE with Abby.

BRAM
Abby says it’s not a real party
until there‘s beer pong.

ABBY
That’s right. Words to live by.
BRAM
You wanna play?
SIMON
Sure.
BRAM
Cool. We need one more.
SIMON
Hey. How about you and me versus

Abby and...
(fake scans the crowd)
Martin. Martin, come over here!

ABBY
No, don’t--

But it’s too late. Martin bounds over.

SIMON
Martin, you’re on Abby’s team.

Abby shoots Simon an annoyed icok. Simon gives an innocent
shrug.

ABBY
Have you ever even played beer pong
before?

MARTIN
Totally.

ABBY

(to everyone, no BS)
Great. No blowing, two re-racks,
two balls in one cup means you
drink three. Cool?

MARTIN
Actually, I was thinking of a
different game. I’ve never played.
39.

BRAM
(gently)
We’1l explain as we go.

ABBY
(not gently)
Simon and Martin, shoot to decide
who goes first. You can‘t break
eye contact. Whoever gets their
ball in wins.

Bram hands Simon and Martin each a ping pong ball. He pats
Simon on the back, his hand lingering on his shoulder.

BRAM
You got this.

Simon turns from the adorable soccer player to face the nerd
threatening to ruin his life. He is DETERMINED TO WIN THIS
SHOOT OFF. Simon focuses, aims, tosses, and...

GETS HIS BALL IN A CUP!

Martin’s ball meanwhile flies across the yard in the complete
wrong direction, hitting a——

PARTYGOER
Ow, what the hell!

MARTIN
Sorry!

SIMON

I got it in!

BRAM
I saw!

And with this, MUSIC KICKS IN for a SEQUENCE intercutting
Simon’s beer pong game with moments of Simon thriving at the
party, emerging from his shell a bit, and getting DEEE-RUNK.

EXT. BEER PONG TABLE - NIGHT
Simon shoots and gets a ball in a cup. He’s a natural!
BRAM
Drink, Martin!
(to Simon)

We need a handshake.

SIMON
We do need a handshake!
40.

EXT. BRAM’S BACKYARD — NIGHT

Simon does Big Sean’s rap from Justin Bieber’s “As Long As
You Love Me” for a crowd of KIDS. He is surprisingly good.

SIMON
Now we on top of the worid,
‘Cause that's just how we do.
Used to tell me sky's the limit
Now the sky’s our point of view!

EXT. BEER PONG TABLE ~ NIGHT

Bram gets a ball in a cup. They do an elaborate handshake
they've apparently just made up.

MARTIN
Should we have a handshake too?

ABBY
You get one ball in, we’ll make up
a handshake.
EXT. BRAM’S BACKYARD - NIGHT
Simon grabs Leah and pulls her onto the grass where a bunch
of kids are dancing. She gives in and starts actually having
fun.

EXT. BEER PONG TABLE - LATER

Bram gets in a shot and Martin has to chug a beer. He sways
a little, already kind of drunk.

ABBY
De you want me to drink for you?

MARTIN
(trying for swagger)
I can hold my own, kiddo.
He THROWS the ball.

SPECTATOR
It’s not your turn, Mar-tard!

EXT. BRAM’S BACKYARD - NIGHT
Simon watches as Bram surveys the snack table then pops a

REESE’S PEANUT BUTTER CUP into his mouth. Simon is feeling
like Bram is totally Blue.
Al.

EXT. BEER PONG TABLE - LATER

Simon and Bram have one cup to go. Simon is up. If he makes
the shot, they win.

BRAM
You got this.

Simon takes a deep breath, focuses, and shoots the ball. And
he gets it in!

BRAM (CONT’D)
Yes!

Simon and Bram share a quick victory hug. Simon is totally
feeling their chemistry.

BRAM (CONT’D)
I’m gonna go make us victory
drinks. Be right back.

Bram heads inside. A wasted Martin approaches Simon.

MARTIN
I think tonight is going well. She
didn't want to see my ventriloquist
act but that actually works out
because I don’t have my dummy with--

Before Martin can finish, he BARFS all over. A little of it
splatters on Simon’s shoes.

SIMON
Damnit, Martin.

INT. BRAM’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

Simon carries his barf-covered shoes as he drunkenly searches
for the bathroom door. He opens it. Except it isn’t the
bathroom. It’s a...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

...where Bram is making out with a HOT SOPHOMORE GIRL, who is
aggressively unzipping his pants. Bram starts to unhook her
bra.

Simon stands there in shock. Bram looks up, notices Simon.

SIMON
I, wh-- sorry. Bathroom. Bye.

Simon slams the door shut. He sighs. Guess Bram wasn’t Blue
after all. Fuck.
42.

EXT. BRAM’S YARD - NIGHT

A spent Simon comes outside to find Martin passed out, Nick
sitting alone spiraling about his lack of sexual experience,
and Abby dancing with Garrett and Leah. Simon approaches.

ABBY
No, that is definitely not it.

GARRETT
(spastically dancing)
Simon, tell them that this is the

Macarena.

SIMON
I got thrown up on. Can we go
home?

EXT. SIMON’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Abby and Simon say goodbye to Leah who is in her car.

SIMON ABBY
Thanks for the ride. See you Monday, babe.

Abby and Simon approach Simon’s front door. A light is still
on in the living room.

SIMON
Oh god. I think my parents are
still up. Do I seem drunk?

Simon struggles not to sway.

ABBY
Yes. Just stand strong, like a
tree. And think of something sad.
Like that documentary about how all
the whales hate living at Sea
World.

SIMON
I can’t think about that. Too sad.

ABBY
Exactly. And here.

Abby takes a JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER out of her purse, scoops a
dollop out with her finger and offers it to Simon.

SIMON
Uh, no thanks?
43.

ABBY
It’s to cover up the booze on your
breath. Which right now smeils
like my Uncle Lester when the
Braves lose a game. Or win a game.

Simon takes a scoop. Through a mouthful of peanut butter:

SIMON
You're my smartest friend. You
should get an award. For
outstanding friendship smartness
and intelligence.

Abby wipes a glob of peanut butter from Simon’s upper lip.

ABBY
Let me do the talking, ‘kay?

INT. SIMON’S HOUSE ~- NIGHT
Simon and Abby enter. Denise and Jack are watching a movie.

DENISE
Hi, guys. How was the party?

ABBY
Great.

Denise sniffs the air.

DENISE
Why does it smell like peanut
butter?

SIMON
(drunk/guilty)
What? No, it doesn’t! Maybe
you're having a stroke.

ABBY
Okay, good night! Thanks for
letting me stay over!

Abby drags Simon out of the room. Once they’re gone:

DENISE
He's a little drunk, right?

JACK
Definitely. But he didn’t drive
and he made it home by curfew. So
I’d say we’re killing it.
44.

Denise nods in agreement. Then:
DENISE
Do you think we should have Abby
sleep on the couch?
JACK
Nah, there’s nothing to worry
about. She’s way out of his
league.
Denise gives Jack a shove.
INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT
Abby snores soundly on a sleeping bag on the floor. Simon is
in bed, wide awake, mind reeling. He takes out his iPhone
and opens a new e-mail.
He begins to type quickly, the words pouring out of him:
SIMON (V.0.)}
Dear Blue, I’ve been thinking about
why I haven’t come out yet. Maybe
it's because it doesn’t seem fair
that only gay people have to come
out. Why is straight the default?

Simon stares over at Abby, sleeping peacefully. He imagines
a SEQUENCE of his best friends “coming out”...

cUT TO:
INT. ABBY’S APARTMENT - DAY (SIMON'S FANTASY)

Nick’s Mom takes Nick’s Dad’s hand.
INT. LEAH’S HOUSE - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY)

LEAH
I have a crush on Nick. Because...

Leah's family looks STUNNED. Leah’s Dad walks out of the
room, furious. Leah hangs her head, devastated.
BACK TO REALITY:

Simon continues writing to Blue.

Or maybe it's because I’m tired of
I keep changing in all

coming out.

And every single time, I have to
reintroduce myself to the world all
over again.

Simon takes a moment to consider. Then, he keeps writing:

SIMON (V.0.}
There's not that much of high
school left.

INT. / EXT. SIMON’S CAR / CREEKWOOD HIGH - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Simon, Nick, and Leah drive into school with iced coffees,
their classic morning routine. They laugh and joke with the
ease of lifelong friends.

SIMON (¥.0.)
And part of me wants to hold on to
who I’ve always been, just a little
longer.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)

Simon’s ROOMMATE hangs a sexy EMILY RATAJKOWSKI POSTER above
his bed.

SIMON (V.0.)
And then in college, I’1l be gay
and proud, I promise.
47.

Simon hangs a MICHAEL ANGELAKOS PASSION PIT POSTER above his
bed.

BACK TO:

INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Simon finishes writing to Blue.

SIMON (V.0.)
Not sure who I’m promising. You?
The universe? Myself? I’11 keep
ruminating. Love, Jacques.

Simon hits SEND. After a moment, he panics. He reviews his
message, and there it is in front of him: “Love, Jacques.”
He closes his e-mail.

SIMON
(terrified)
Oh god.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY
The cast mills about onstage, waiting for rehearsal to begin.

TAYLOR
~~ and then for New Year’s, we fly
to Kauai! But don't worry, I'm
going to wear so much sunscreen. A
tan Oliver would completely ruin
the integrity of our production.
Anyone else doing Christmas to
Hawaii?

Abby stares daggers at Taylor.

CAL
I'm going to an unheated vacation
house in the middle of nowhere. As
is my bleak family tradition.

SIMON
I’m staying here. Alice is coming
home from--

MARTIN

(approaching. }
Simon, can I talk to you?

Simon's heart sinks.

SIMON
-- College.
48.

He reluctantly steps away to talk to Martin.

MARTIN
I got nowhere with Abby at Bram’s
party!

SIMON

Well, maybe you shouldn’t have worn
your “I'm A Fungus” t-shirt.

MARTIN
Fungi! Like fun guy.

SIMON
I got it, Martin. Nobody wants to
have sex with a pun.

Martin is starting to get worked up.

MARTIN
Stop joking around, man! I don’t
want to leak those e-mails, but I
will. And I know you don’t want
the whole school learning that you
and your internet boyfriend have
crushes on Jon Snow.

Simon freezes.

SIMON
You can’t drag Blue into this.
He’s really private.

Martin avoids eye contact. He clearly feels guilty, but not
guilty enough to take back the threat.

SIMON (CONT'D)
(panicking)
You don’t understand. If you
posted our e-mails he’d be so
freaked out. He’d never talk to me
again.

Before Martin has a chance to respond, Abby approaches with
her Oliver script. She has no idea she’s walking into such a
loaded moment.

ABBY
I cannot memorize all my Oliver
lines. The Artful Dodger never
shuts the hell up.
(off their weird looks)
What's wrong with you two?
49.

Simon takes a beat. Then:

SIMON
Martin’s having trouble learning
his part too. Why don't we all go
to Waffle House later this week and
run lines?

ABBY
Really? That’d be great!

MARTIN
I’m insky.

Abby heads off. Once she’s gone:

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Nice work, Spier.

SIMON
{cold}
Go to hell, Martin.

Simon walks backstage, anxious to get away from Martin. He
takes out his phone. He has a new e-mail from Blue. We hear
it read in the anonymous voice Simon imagined, before he
suspected Blue was Bram:

BLUE (V.0.)
Jacques, I know what you mean about
wanting to wait till college.

EXT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT STEPS - LATER THAT DAY
Simon heads towards his car, a dazed look on his face.

BLUE (V.O.)
I've got a pretty good thing going
as closeted me. Can’t I just hold
on a little longer?

(beat)
And you're right, it’s not fair
that straight people get to go
about their lives without thinking
twice.

Simon passes a straight couple MAKING OUT passionately.
Nobody pays them any attention.

BLUE (¥V.0.)

They should definitely have to come
out. As straight. I guess this is
our version of the Homosexual
Agenda? Love, Blue.
50.

Simon takes out his phone. He opens up the same e-mail we
just heard. There it is in black and white: “Love, Blue.”

He stares at the words, terrified of losing Blue.
INT. WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY
Simon and Abby grab a booth.

SIMON
{scanning)
I guess Martin’s not here yet.

ABBY
Um, not to be a bitch, but why are
we hanging out with Martin so much
lately?

SIMON
I like him. He marches to the beat
of his own drum.

ABBY
I bet the drum has a bad pun on it.
(then)
Sooo, while we're waiting... what

do you think about Nick?

SIMON
What do you mean?
ABBY
Like, do you think Nick is... cool?

Simon knows where this is going. And he wants no part of it.

SIMON
(too sharp)
Of course I think he’s cool. If I
didn’t, why would I be friends with
him?

Abby shoots him a weird look.

ABBY
Uh, okay, sorry. I guess what I’m
trying to ask is, do you think he’s
worthy of the new girl in school
crushing on him? Just a little?

Simon stiffens. He’s going to have to play defense to keep
Nick and Abby apart. Again.
51.

SIMON
No. You should not get with Nick.
ABBY
(deflating)
Really? Why not?
SIMON
Because...
(lying)
Nick's bad to women.
ABBY
What?
SIMON

Not like Chris Brown bad. He’s
just immature. And selfish.

ABBY
Really? How?

SIMON
(thinks, then)
He had a serious girlfriend before
you moved here. And he cheated on
her.

ABBY
He did?

SIMON
Yeah. She was crazy about him.
And he slept with someone else.

ABBY
I mean, that’s shitty... but we're
in high school. Stuff like that
happens.

SIMON

The girl he slept with was his
girlfriend's cousin.

ABBY
Oh my god.

SIMON
I know. She came to visit for the
summer. From Maine.

ABBY
Well, maybe he really liked her?
52.

SIMON
(getting frustrated)
No. He didn’t. That‘s the worst
part. He just kept saying, “How
cool would it be if I banged

cousins?”
ABBY

That's really effed up.
SIMON

Yeah.
ABBY

It doesn’t sound like him at all.

SIMON
You can’t say anything to Nick.
He’d be so mad if he knew I told
you.

ABBY
I won’t. I promise.

They sit in unpleasant silence for a moment. Simon feels
like shit. Then, Martin enters wearing a NON-PUNNY POLO
SHIRT and some PRODUCT in his hair.

MARTIN
Sorry I’m late.

ABBY
Hey. Nice shirt.

Martin immediately turns beet red and gets so weird.

MARTIN
Oh, really? I don’t know. I’m
just trying something.

Abby smiles, a little charmed by Martin’s awkwardness. Their
waiter, LYLE (17, cute), approaches.

LYLE
Hey guys, what can I get you?

MARTIN
Hey, Lyle.
(to Simon and Abby)
Do you guys know Lyle? We have
Latin together.

ABBY SIMON
Don’t think so. How’s it going?
53.

LYLE
(to Simon)
Actually, we had Bio together last
year.

SIMON
Oh, sorry.

LYLE
That’s okay. It was a big class.
I have a good memory for faces.

SIMON
I don’t. One time I asked Jake
Gyllenhaal for Toby Maguire’s
autograph. He said no.

LYLE
(smiles, then)
I'm going to seem like a total
stalker, but I’m guessing you want
a banana strawberry waffle with
whipped cream and chocolate chips?

Simon is surprised: clearly Lyle has REALLY noticed him.
Could he be into guys?

SIMON
Yeah. I do.

LYLE
I’ve waited on you before. And
it‘s kind of a memorable order.

SIMON
Because I order like a four-year-
old destined for diabetes?
LYLE
(laughing)
No. You order like someone who
knows what he wants.
Simon smiles at Lyle and imagines...
cur TO:
INT. BLUE’S BEDROOM - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)

The same navy blue bedroom we’ve seen our faceless Blue
writing e-mails in.
54.

Except now the door opens and LYLE ENTERS, taking off his
Waffle House vest.

BACK TO REALITY:
INT. WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY

Simon stares at Lyle as he writes down their order, wondering
if he could be Blue.

INT. WAFFLE HOUSE - LATER

We're mid-meal. Abby and Martin run Oliver lines. Simon
keeps casually glancing over at Lyle, waiting tables.

ABBY
(as Artful Dodger}
Fagin, this is my new friend,
Oliver Twist.

Simon checks the script and gives her a thumbs up. Martin
stares dreamily at Abby.

SIMON
It’s your line, Martin.

MARTIN
(ignoring him)
That's a great British accent. You
sound like Audrey Hepburn.

ABBY
Thanks. Do you need Simon to give
you your line?

MARTIN
(ignoring her)
Have you ever been to London?

ABBY
Nope. Simon, maybe you should give
him--

MARTIN

You‘re from D.C., right?

ABBY
Mhmm. Let's try not to lose--

MARTIN
That's awesome. What part?
55.

ABBY
What's with the third degree,
Martin? You writing a book about
black girls from D.C.?

MARTIN
(faux offended)
I’m naturally inquisitive. My mom
says it’s one of my best qualities.

Abby can’t help but smile at Martin.

. ABBY
Not sure your mom is the most
reliable source.

MARTIN
Are you calling Janet Addison a
liar? Because that’s blasphemy,
she is a phenomenal judge of
character.

Abby laughs and grabs a french fry off Martin’s plate.

Simon watches, pleasantly surprised. It’s not exactly
sexually charged but maybe Martin isn’t totally hopeless?

simon notices Lyle standing outside on his break and decides
to take advantage of the opportunity.

SIMON
Be right back.

EXT. WAFFLE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Simon steps outside to find Lyle finishing up something on
his phone. Simon musters up his courage and approaches.

SIMON
So, were you in Bio the day we
performed the “identifying leaves”
test?

Lyle looks up from his phone.
LYLE
Oh my god, yes. And Joel Winslow
ate the poison ivy?
SIMON
Yes! Because Doug Fogerty told him
it was pot.

Lyle laughs.
56.

LYLE

I should get back to disinfecting
the waffle irons.

(off Simon’s look)
It’s not as bad as it sounds.
Actually, it is.

(then)
If you don’t remember me the next
time we meet I’m going to take it
personally.

They share a smile and Lyle heads in. Simon takes out his
phone and notices he has a new e-mail. Blue.

cur To:
EXT. WAFFLE HOUSE - MINUTES EARLIER (FLASHBACK)

We're back to moment ago, when Simon stepped outside and saw
Lyle finishing something on his phone. Could he have been
typing this very e-mail?

BACK TO:
EXT. WAFFLE HOUSE - AS WE WERE

Simon starts to read the e-mail, imagining Lyle’s voice
narrating it.

LYLE (V.0.)
So my dad’s flying in tonight for
Chanukah. Did I mention my parents
are divorced and I’m half-Jewish?

cur TO:
EXT. CRAPPY HOTEL - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)

A BEAT UP CHEVY pulls into the parking lot of this low-rent
hotel. LYLE’S FATHER (40's) gets out of the car, takes in
the hotel and sighs.

LYLE (V.0.)
My dad is staying at the same
crappy hotel as always. And we’ll
do all our horribly awkward
traditions.

INT. CRAPPY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY)

Lyle’s Father opens the front door to let in Lyle. He steps
into the room and the two men share an awkward hug.
57.

INT. CRAPPY HOTEL ROOM - LATER (SIMON’S FANTASY)

Lyle watches as his dad makes a big show of PRETENDING TO
LIGHT A MENORAH.

LYLE (V.0.)
We'll mime lighting the menorah.
We won't actually light it because
that could set off the smoke
detector.

INT. CRAPPY HOTEL ROOM - LATER (SIMON‘S FANTASY)

Lyle sits in front of a bunch of WRAPPING PAPER, having just
unwrapped seven VERY LACKLUSTER GIFTS.

LYLE (V.0.)
And then I’1l open all eight
presents. Because this is the only
night of Chanukah we'll actually
spend together.

He finishes unwrapping the last one... a pair of BOXERS with
bottles of HOT SAUCE on them. He feigns enthusiasm.

LYLE (V.0.)
The only thing worse than how much
I hate the gifts my dad gives me is
how much he hates the gifts he
gives me.

His dad shrugs and winces.

LYLE {¥.0.)
Would you believe I’m actually
considering doubling down and
turning this awkward mess into 4
coming out thing? Something about
him living across the country makes
me feel like I can tell him without
blowing up my entire world.

Lyle puts down the boxers. He takes a deep breath and stares
his dad straight in the eyes.

LYLE (V.0.)
Do you think I’m crazy? Love,
Blue.
BACK TO REALITY:
EXT. WAFFLE HOUSE — DAY

Simon responds immediately:
58.

SIMON (V.0.)
No, Blue. I don’t think you’re
erazy. I think you’re brave as
fuck. Love, Jacques.

INT. / EXT. ABBY'S CAR / SHADY CREEK STREETS - DUSK

Abby drives as Simon sits shotgun. He’s deep in thought as
Abby rambles on about Martin.

ABBY
(thoughtful)
Y'know, Martin’s not that bad. But
we didn’t get anything done. He
was too busy asking how being a
child of divorce informed my ideal
romantic partner...

As Abby continues her rant about Martin, we...

CUT TO:
INT. CRAPPY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY}
Lyle and his dad sit on the foot of the bed. Lyle takes a
deep breath and tells his dad he’s gay. His dad nods as the
enormity of Lyle’s words sink in.

BACK TO:
INT. / EXT. ABBY’S CAR / SHADY CREEK STREETS - DUSK

And something about imagining this is making Simon
practically burst...

ABBY
Maybe if I try recording my Oliver
lines and listening to them while I

sleep--
SIMON
Abby!
(beat, then)
I'm gay.
ABBY
Oh.

They drive for a moment. Simon begins to panic at the
enormity of what he’s just done:

SIMON
You can’t tell anyone. No one else
knows-—-
59.

Abby pulls over. They’re quiet for a moment.
ABBY
So this is the first time you've
told anyone?

Simon nods.

ABBY (CONT'D)
I‘m honored. .

SIMON
Are you surprised?
ABBY
(thinks, then)
No.
SIMON
So you knew?
ABBY
No.
SIMON
But you’re not surprised?
ABBY
(gently)

Do you want me to be surprised?

SIMON
I don’t know.

ABBY
What are you going to do now? Are
you going to tell more people?

SIMON
I don’t know.

ABBY
Okay, well, I love you.

And there’s nothing else to say. They stare at each other a
moment longer. Abby smiles at him then begins to drive
again. Simon brushes away tears.

INT. SIMON’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Simon enters to find his parents cuddled up, reading.

DENISE
Hey, Si.
60.

JACK
How was your day, buddy?

Simon considers the enormity of his day. But all he says is:

SIMON
It was fine.

They smile at him then go back to reading.

Simon lingers, staring at the OLD FRAMED FAMILY PHOTOS on the
piano.

It all seems like a simpler time. And one that seems further
away with every passing second.

As he exits, we hear his next e-mail to Blue:

SIMON (V.0.)
Dear Blue, I hope it goes okay with
your dad. Whatever happens, you
inspired me.

EXT. SIMON’S BACKYARD - NIGHT
Simon lies in the hammock, writing to Blue on his phone:

SIMON (V.O.)
I came out to my friend tonight. I
never would have done it without
you.

Simon considers for a moment. He’s buzzing with adrenaline
and excitement and he can’t help but add...

SIMON (V.0.)
Maybe we should ride this bravery
train and reveal our identities.
I’m dying to know who you are.
Love, Jacques.

INT. SIMON’'S ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Simon is asleep. Then, the unmistakable NEW E-MAIL BING on
his phone. Simon checks his e-mail and reads Blue’s new
message:

LYLE (V.0.)
I told my dad. It was insanely
awkward. But in the end, it went
well.

{MORE)
él.

LYLE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
We even decided to throw caution to
the wind and light the menorah for
real.

CUT TO:
INT. CRAPPY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY)
Lyle‘s Dad lights the Chanukah candles with a Bic.

LYLE (V.0.)
That went less well.

The SPRINKLERS in the room turn on, dousing Lyle and his dad
with water.

BACK TO REALITY:
INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT
Simon smiles, continues reading:

LYLE (V.0.)
Also, you’ve got it backwards.
It’s you who inspired me.
{beat}
But, I’m sorry. I’m just not ready
for us to know each other’s
identities. Love, Blue.

Simon’s smile fades as he comes crashing back to earth.

Then, he notices he has TWO UNREAD TEXTS: one from Martin,
one from Abby. He opens Martin’s first.

CUT TO:
INT. MARTIN’S ROOM - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY)

Martin addresses the camera, relaying her text message out
loud:

MARTIN

Great job orchestrating today’s
hang. I feel like Abby and I were
really vibing. Keep up the good
work and maybe your secret will
stay in the closer.

(then)
Sorry, autotype. Closet.

BACK TO REALITY:
62.

INT. SIMON’S ROOM —- NIGHT
Simon looks worried. Then, he opens Abby’s text.
cUT TO:
INT. ABBY‘'S ROOM - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY)
Abby sits on her bed in PJS. She speaks directly to camera:
ABBY
You coming out made me think. Life
is short. Don’t care about Nick‘s
past. Gonna tell him how I feel.
Heart emoji, nervous emoji. Sorry
for late night text. Xx.
She BLOWS TWO KISSES to the camera.
BACK TO REALITY:
INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Simon stares at his phone, very worried.

SIMON
Shit.

Off Simon, desperate to protect his relationship with Blue...
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY

Nick closes his locker door and is startled to find Simon
standing right it.

NICK
Ahh! God, ever since that sinus
surgery you’re such a quiet
breather.

Nick and Simon start walking to class.

SIMON

I figured out your dream.
NICK

Huh?
SIMON

Putting in your contacts backwards.
I figured out what you can’t see
that’s right in front of you.
63.

NICK
Oh, yeah. That was a good one.
But not as good as the one I had
last night. I’m playing goalie for
Atlético Madrid, and Lionel Messi
is about to shoot on me when I
realize there's a heart shaped hole
in my shorts and my balls are
hanging out-

SIMON
Shut up!
(then)
I figured out what you can’t see
that’s right in front of you.

NICK
What?
SIMON
Leah.
NICK
What about her?
SIMON
She’s who you really want to be
with.
NICK

Uh, wouldn't I know if I wanted to
be with Leah?

SIMON
No. Because you’re too close to
it. You’ve been best friends so
long that you can’t see what’s
right in front of you.

NICK
(doubtful)
I don’t think so-

SIMON
Of course! It’s always been Leah.
Abby was just your way of
distracting yourself because you’re
scared to go for it with Leah.

NICK
I dunno, the Abby thing feels real.
And I’ve been thinking, the sexual
experience thing isn’t really that
big a deal.

(MORE)
64.

NICK (CONT'D)
(drops voice to whisper)
I’ve actually been practicing. I
got this thing on the internet
called a pocket puss——

SIMON
(blurting cut)
Abby likes Martin!

NICK
What? Martin Addison? No way.

Simon takes a breath. Time for some more lying.

SIMON
I know. I was surprised too, but
they've been spending a ton of time
together at rehearsals. She likes
how quirky he is.

NICK
Wow.
(then)
But Martin definitely isn’t good at
sex!
SIMON

I heard he learned a ton from some
divorced woman. On a family
cruise.

Nick looks disgusted as they stop outside his classroom.

SIMON (CONT’D)
Just promise me you’1l think about
asking Leah out. You're the one
who's always saying the
subconscious works in mysterious
ways.

NICK
{unsure)
I do say that.

Nick heads into his class, lost in thought. Off Simon,
feeling like the biggest shit heel in the world...

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

Simon shuts his locker door to find Leah standing behind it,
& la Simon in the previous scene.

SIMON
Ahh!
LEAH
{uncomfortable)
So... Nick asked me to have dinner
before the Christmas homecoming

game.
Simon feigns ignorance.

SIMON
Uh, okay?

LEAH
No, you don’t understand. He was
like, “Do you want to have dinner?”
And I was like, “Sure, are Abby and
Simon in?” And he was like, “I was
thinking it could be just the two
of us. Like... a date.”

SIMON
Oh. Wow. This is amazing!

LEAR
It is?

SIMON
I mean, isn’t it? I know you’re
into him.

65.

Leah looks surprised. Like she didn't realize Simon knew

that.

SIMON (CONT'D)
Come on, Leah. I‘m your best
friend. I see things. And I’ve
always thought you guys would be
great together.

LEAE
Really?

SIMON
Of course. You were born two weeks
apart, you grew up across the
street from each other, your middle
names are both Alex. You guys are
one tragic boating accident away
from being a Nicholas Sparks movie.

Simon sees that Leah still looks very unsure.
pretty sure he knows why...

And he’s
66.

SIMON (CONT’D)
(gently)
I know you haven’t really dated
before. But you have nothing to be
worried about. It's Nick.

Leah finally manages a nervous:

LEAH
Okay, then. I guess I’1l say yes.

SIMON
I’m so psyched for you guys.

Simon gives her a hug, praying that he hasn’t set Leah up to
get her heart broken by the guy she's in love with...

EXT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT
Creekwood’s Christmas-themed homecoming is a real spectacle:

The MARCHING BAND plays a horn version of “All I Want For
Christmas Is You”.

CHEERLEADERS form a very impressive Christmas tree (okay,
it's a pyramid, but they're holding ornaments!).

STUDENTS chow down on pulled pork and apple cider from a
collection of food trucks.

And the CREEKWOOD GRIZZLY BEAR MASCOT chases the ALMONT
ARCHER (@ guy dressed as a giant foam bow and arrow) across
the field.

Simon and Abby take in the scene.

ABBY
Why is the Almont Archer mascot a
giant bow and arrow? Shouldn't it
be an archer?

SIMON
It used to be this super racist
Native American character that was
played by a Jewish kid with a spray

tan.
ABBY
(cringing)
Oooooh.
SIMON

Yeah. This is better.
67.

They scan the crowd for Nick and Leah.

ABBY
(bummed)
I guess Nick and Leah are still on
their date.

SIMON
I’m sure they‘ll be here soon.
(then, off Abby)
I'm really sorry it didn't work out
with you and Nick.

ABBY
It’s cool. I’m not really thinking
about it. Definitely not picturing
them parked on a quiet street. Zayn
Malik comes on, they make out. And
then it starts to rain...

Simon feels awful. Tries to change the subject.

SIMON
How about something deep fried?

He leads Abby to the food trucks. Abby gazes out at the
FOOTBALL PLAYERS warming up on the field in their uniforms.

ABBY
At least the eye candy here is a
distraction. Is it just me, or is
the Almont QB insanely hot?

Simon is immediately uncomfortable.

ABBY (CONT’D)
We can talk about stuff like that
now, you know.

SIMON
I guess so. I don’t really know
how though.

ABBY
Then you better practice. Simon,
do you think the quarterback is
looking fooiiine in his hot pants?

SIMON
Yeah, he’s pretty fine.

ABBY
No. Foooiinne.
68.

SIMON
(laughing)
Foooiine.

Simon and Abby approach a BURGER TRUCK.

ABBY
Four cheeseburgers, please.
(then, realizing)
Oh, duh, Nick and Leah will have
eaten. Just two.

Simon gives Abby a sad smile.

ABBY (CONT’D)
You know what, even if Nick and I
had gotten together, we just
would’ve broken up when college
started.

SIMON
You would have?

ABBY

Of course. All high school couples
say they’re gonna do the long
distance thing. Then three months
inte freshman year you get tired of
Facetime sex, have a few too many
vodka cranberries, and all of a
sudden you’re hooking up with your
Poly Sci TA in the back of his
truck.

(off Simon)
It happened to my cousin.

Before Simon has a chance to respond...

LYLE (0.8.)
Hey, guys.

Simon and Abby turn around to find Lyle getting in line at a
chicken and biscuits truck.

ABBY

Lyle. My favorite waiter.
SIMON

Hey. ‘Sup.

Simon quickly runs his hand through his hair. And Abby
realizes Simon is into Lyle.
69.

ABBY
I’m going to go grab us some
drinks.

Abby gives Simon a pointed look and walks away.

SIMON
Wouldn't have taken you for a
homecoming guy.

LYLE
I’m just here for the biscuits.

SIMON
I get it. It’s all about the sweet
tea and camaraderie for this guy.

Simon cringes at his lame line. But Lyle smiles. Charmed?

LYLE
(suddenly nervous)
Hey, so. Can I ask you a question?

Simon is nearly bursting with anticipation.

SIMON
Of course.

Lyle steels himself. Then asks:

LYLE
What’s Abby’s deal?

Seriously? Lyle likes Abby? Simon can barely hide his
devastation.

LYLE (CONT'D)
I know you and her hang out a lot.
Are the two of you--

SIMON
(annoyed)
We're just friends.

LYLE
Cool. Good to know. God, I could
never be best friends with someone
that hot.

SIMON
Yup. Every day is a struggle.
70.

LYLE
Uh, I think the Creekwood Grizzly
Bear wants to talk to you.

Lyle points to the edge of the field where the CREEKWOOD
GRIZZLY BEAR MASCOT is beckoning to Simon.

Simon goes over to the Bear, confused.

CREEKWOOD GRIZZLY BEAR
Dude. It’s me.

Simon looks into the mouth of the bear, where he can see
behind some gauzy black fabric... Martin.

SIMON
You’re the Creekwood Grizzly Bear?
Actually, that makes total sense.

MARTIN
Thank you.

SIMON
Not a compliment.

MARTIN
I saw you come in with Abby. Has
she said anything about me since
Waffle House?

SIMON
She had fun.

MARTIN
I knew we had a breakthrough!

Simon isn’t in the mood for Martin’s bullshit right now.

SIMON
I gotta go, Martin.

MARTIN
Wait! I need to build on this
momentum fast. What do I do?

SIMON
I'm sure you'll figure something
out.

MARTIN

No, I won’t figure something out.
That's what you’re for, to help me
figure it out--
71.

Maybe it’s what just happened with Lyle. Maybe it’s feeling
like shit about what he’s doing to Nick and Abby. But Simon
snaps:

SIMON
I don’t know what to tell you,
Martin! I guess if I was a
heterosexual guy who liked a girl,
I’d shout it from the rooftops.
Because I could. So maybe it’s
time to tell her you like her. Go
big or go home.

Simon takes off, leaving Martin considering his words.

He finds Abby, struggling to carry their burgers and teas.
Simon takes the cups.

ABBY
(re: Lyle)
Eh?
SIMON
Nah.
ABBY
Aww. At least we can die alone
together.

She puts her arm around Simon and they head to find seats.
EXT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL BLEACHERS - LATER

Simon and Abby sit in the packed stands, digging into their
burgers and waiting for the game to start.

Nick and Leah approach, fresh from their date. They're both
dressed a little nicer than usual. Nick glances at Abby,
uncomfortable. Leah looks nervous as hell.

NICK
Hey, guys.

SIMON
Hey.

Nick and Leah sit down next to them, hard to read. Simon
tries to break the silence.

SIMON (CONT‘D)
Uh, how was dinner?
72.

NICK
(forced)
It was cool.

LEAH
Mhmm. We got soup dumplings.

Another loaded silence. Our gang has never been so awkward
together. Finally:

ABBY
(to Leah)
I like your dress.

LEAH
Oh, thanks--

NICK
(bitter, to Abby)
I bet you'd like it even better if
it had a pun on it.

ABBY
What's that supposed to mean?

Nick shrugs, and puts his arm around Leah. She’s super
uncomfortable, weirded out by Nick and Abby’s charged
dynamic. Simon cringes. This is a disaster.

ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
And now, everyone please rise for
the national anthem.

Taylor walks onto the field with a microphone.

SIMON
I’m sure this will be a subtle and
tasteful rendition.

TAYLOR
{crazy vibrato)
Oooc-ocohhh say--

Taylor stops singing when she notices Martin rushing the
field in his Grizzly Bear costume. He reaches for her
microphone. As they struggle over the mic:

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
What the hell are you doing?

MARTIN
I need the mic.
73.

He YANKS the mic away from her. Everyone stares at them,
rapt. Martin takes off his BEAR HEAD.

SIMON
(under his breath)
Oh no.

MARTIN
Sorry to interrupt, but I have
something to say that’s a little
more important than our national
anthem. No offense, America.

Martin waits for a laugh that never comes. He clears his
throat and finds Abby in the audience.

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Abby, when you came to Creekwood
High School three and a half short
months ago, you didn’t just
transfer into a new school. You
transferred into my heart.

As he talks, he walks up into the bleachers, approaching her.

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Whether it’s being your partner in
pong or your Waffle House
warrior...

Everyone looks confused. This isn’t the easiest declaration
of love to follow.

MARTIN (CONT’D)

I’ve really loved getting to know
you this semester.

{deep breath)
And I know you’re a beautiful,
smart, perfect woman, and I'm just
a sweaty schlub in a bear suit.
But like ol’ Bogie said, it’s a
crazy, mixed-up world.

By now Martin is standing right in front of Abby.
MARTIN (CONT'D)
So? What do you say? Would you

want to go out sometime?

ABBY
oh. Um...

Abby takes Martin’s microphone and SWITCHES IT OFF. Martin
shuffles uncomfortably. He can tell this isn’t going well.
74.

JOCK A FEW ROWS BACK
She’s too hot for you, Martin!

JOCK’S BUDDY
Way out of your league, buddy!

People around the Jocks LAUGH.

ABBY
Shut up, Lucas!
(then, to Martin)
I-- I just don’t feel that way
about you.

NICK
(surprised, blurting out)
You don’t?

Abby shoots him a weird look. Nick looks at Simon like, “You
toid me she liked him.” Simon shrugs.

ABBY
(to Martin)
I'm really sorry. I hope we can
still be friends.

Martin is devastated. He takes a deep breath, wipes his
sweaty hair out of his eyes. Then:

MARTIN
Sure. Don’t worry about it.

He turns the mic back on and forces a manic:
MARTIN (CONT'D)
And now back to Taylor with our

regular scheduled anthem!

He stumbles awkwardly back down to the field. He almost
trips over a STRAY HOTDOG. Abby picks up Martin's bear head.

ABBY
(feels terrible)
Martin, don‘t forget your... head.

He grabs it, puts it on, and abruptly re-assumes chipper
mascot mode, dancing back down to the field.

Nick whispers to Simon:

NICK
You said she liked him.
75.

SIMON
I thought she did.

ABBY
(stricken)
That was horrible.

LEAR
(gently)
Den’t worry. People will have
forgotten about it by the time
we're back from Christmas break.

Simon watches Martin go, hoping Leah is right...
INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - NIGET

Simon sits at his desk, calling Martin and watching a MUTED
VIDEO someone has posted to the CREEKSECRETS TUMBLR of
Martin‘’s big speech under the headline GRIZZLY GROVELS FOR
LOVE.

Simon grimaces, feeling bad for Martin in spite of himself.

MARTIN (ON PHONE)
You’ve reached Martin, leave me a
message.
{bad jokey message)
Oh no you didn’t, mother--

BEEEEEP.
SIMON
Martin, it’s Simon. I’m sorry
about tonight. Call me, okay?

Simon hangs up, worried about Martin.

NORA (0.8.)
She’s here!

INT. SIMON’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Everyone excitedly greets Alice, home from college for
Christmas break.

DENISE
You're supposed to gain the
freshman fifteen, not lose the
freshman twenty!

ALICE
You are literally insane.
76.

JACK
She looks fat to me.

DENISE
That’s not funny, Jack!

SIMON
I think you lock the exact same
weight. But a foot shorter.

ALICE
I missed you, bub.

Simon and Alice HUG. Everything seems a little better to
Simon with Alice around.

INT. SIMON’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jack passes out mulled cider for the family as Alice tells
them all about college.

ALICE
I mean, I get being comfortable

with your body but my reommate is
always naked...

Alice fades into the background as Simon checks his phone:
new e-mail from Blue. He steps away to read it and we...

CUT TO:
INT. BLUE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY)

Blue writes an e-mail as he packs a duffel bag. We're back
to anonymous Blue, shot so we never see his face.
BLUE (V.0.)

I’m drinking eggnog and packing to

go to my dad’s cabin on Lake Rabun.

I’m pretty sure there’s a photo of

it on the Wikipedia page for

“middle of nowhere.”

INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT

Simon pauses. Something about this sounds familiar. The
wheels in his head begin to turn...

FLASHBACK TO:
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cal tells the Oliver cast:
77.

CAL
I’m going to an unheated vacation
house basically in the middie of

nowhere.
BACK TO:
INT. SIMON‘S ROOM - NIGHT
Simon connects the dots. Could Cal be Blue?
SIMON
Holy shit.
He starts imagining...
cUT TO:

EXT. LAKE RABUN CABIN - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)

Cal and his DAD (the same guy as Lyle’s Father) pull up to a
very rustic cabin on a beautiful Georgia lake.

CAL (¥.0.)
There’s barely electricity and
definitely no cell service, so this
will be my last e-mail for a while.

EXT. LAKE RABUN - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)
Cal and his DAD are bundled up on a boat, fishing.

CAL (V.0.)
It should be a real rite of passage
though: a dad and his gay son
pretending they like fishing and
trying to find things to talk about
for two weeks.

Cal's Dad looks like he’s about to say something, then
reconsiders, and takes a sip of beer.

INT. CAL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY)
Cal continues to pack.

CAL (V.0.)
She and Him’s cover of “Have
Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”
just came on Spotify. I know I
should think it’s too twee, but I
kind of love it. Don’t judge me.
And have yourself a merry little
Christmas, Jacques.

(MORE)
78.
CAL (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Don’t judge me for that lame segue

either. God, it’s going to be an

excruciating two weeks without you.

Love, Blue.
INT. SIMON’S LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT
Simon finishes the e-mail. She and Him’s “Have Yourself a
Merry Little Christmas” kicks in and the song carries us into
a SEQUENCE.
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Simon and his entire family pile a cart full of their
favorite holiday foods.

They pass the CANDY AISLE where Simon sees Cal putting a PACK
OF REESE’S CUPS into his basket. He smiles at Simon.

But then suddenly, he’s gone. Just Simon’s imagination.
INT. SIMON’S DINING ROOM — NIGHT

Denise serves everyone FRENCH TOAST for dinner, a Spier
family tradition.

Simon looks past his family to a SPRIG OF MISTLETOE hanging
above a doorway.

He imagines CAL STANDING BENEATH IT. Cal gestures at the
mistletoe, like should we kiss?

INT. SIMON’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Simon and his family watch Love Actually. Jack and Denise
snuggle on the couch. Nora and Alice are sprawled out on the
floor.

Suddenly, an ARM wraps itself around Simon. He looks over to
find Cal curled up next to him. Cal puts his head on Simon's
shoulder. Alice playfully tosses a pillow at them. Denise
offers Cal a glass of cider. Everything is perfect.

Simon reaches for a cookie on the coffee table, and when he
sits back, CAL IS GONE.

INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT
simon is wrapping presents. There’s a KNOCK on his door.

NORA (0.S.)
Simon?

Simon throws a towel over the presents.
79.

SIMON
Come in.

Nora enters with her iPad. She sits on the edge of Simon's
bed and brings her knees to her chest like a little kid.

SIMON (CONT’D)
Well? What do you want?

NORA
I need to show you something.

Nora turns her laptop around. The Creeksecrets Tumblr page
is already open. Simon's face goes white:

Because there’s a new entry: SIMON SPIER’S OPEN INVITATION TO
ALL DUDES. Martin’s SCREENSHOT of Simon and Blue’s e-mails,
accompanied by a short post. As Simon reads...

CUT TO:
INT. MARTIN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (SIMON’S FANTASY)
A vindictive Martin speaks directly to camera.

MARTIN {V.0.)
Dear all dudes of Creekwood, with
this missive, I hereby declare that
I am supremely gay and open for
business. Interested parties may
contact me directly to discuss
arrangements for anal butt sex.
Strong resemblance to Jon Snow
preferred. Ladies need not apply.
Homosexually yours, Simon Spier.

BACK TO:
INT. SIMON’S ROOM — NIGHT
Simon sits frozen in place. Nora stares at him intently.

SIMON
Oh my god.

NORA
I already reported it. They’1ll
take it down.

SIMON
Everyone has already seen it
though.
{then}
It’s true. I’m gay-
80.

Nora is stunned. But she tries not to make a big deal of it.

NORA
Oh.
(then)
So what are you gonna do now?
SIMON
I don't know.
NORA
You could deny it--
SIMON
I’m not going to deny it. I’m not
ashamed-—
NORA

Well, you haven't said anything
until now, so--

SIMON
(snapping)
So what? What the hell are you
talking about?

Nora's face crumples into tears. Simon realizes she’s
completely overwhelmed.

SIMON (CONT'D)
Nora, I--

NORA
It’s not my fault!

She hurries out in tears. Simon feels bad but he has bigger
things to worry about.

He goes to his computer in a total panic. He furiously types
an e-mail to Blue:

SIMON (V.0.)
I know you’re going off the grid
and you probably won’t see this
until you’re back, but something's
happened. You’re going to find out
who I am. But please don’t freak
out and stop writing to me.
Please, Blue. As soon as you get
this, I need you to promise me you
won't disappear.

Simon hits SEND, close to hyperventilating.
81.

His phone BUZZES. Then BUZZES again.

He checks it - texts from his friends:
Abby: Are you okay?

Leah: Can you call me?

Nick: Hey dude. Wanna go for a walk?
Abby: Simon, please call me. I love you.

Simon turns off his phone, unable to deal. He turns off the
lights, crawls under his bed covers, puts a pillow over his
face, and SCREAMS.

INT. SPIER LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Christmas morning. The whole family sits around the tree,
opening presents in pajamas. Nora and Simon avoid each
other's eyes.

SIMON
(opening a gift)
A Kindle case? But I don’t even
have-—

JACK
Open the next one, Sherlock.

Simon opens the next one, revealing a brand new KINDLE. He
stares at it for a long time.

DENISE
Um, if you don’t like it, you can
return it. But since you already
have every other device--

SIMON
(quietly)
No. I love it.

ALICE
Are you okay?

Nora gives Simon a supportive smile.
SIMON
Actually, I want to talk to you
guys about something.

Denise leans in, realizing something’s up.
82.

DENISE
What is it?

But Simon can’t find the words.

JACK
Lemme guess. You got someone
pregnant. No, you’re gay. No,
you're pregnant.

NORA
Dad, stop it.

SIMON
(quietly)
Yeah, I'm pregnant.

JACK
I knew it! What‘d I tell you, he’s
got the glow.

Nobody laughs. Simon looks like he really wants to run out
of the room and throw up, but he forces himself to continue.

SIMON
No. I’m not pregnant.
(deep breath, then)
I’m gay.

A beat as everyone takes in his words. Denise reaches out to
take Simon’s hand.

DENISE
Oh, honey.

Simon stares into his mother’s eyes. His voice is shaking.

SIMON
Don't worry, I’m still me.

DENISE
What? Of course you are.

Simon nods, unsure. Alice puts her arm around Simon’s leg
from her spot on the floor.

ALICE
Good for you, Bub.

Everyone turns to Jack, waiting for him to say something.
83.

JACK
Gay, huh?
(then, forced brightness)
So which one of them did it?

Alice looks like she’s going to kill her father.

SIMON
Did what?

JACK
Which one of your old girlfriends
turned you off women? Was it the
one with the eyebrows or the
overbite?

DENISE NORA
Jack-- JESUS CHRIS, DAD! CAN YOU
EVER JUST SHUT THE HELL UP!?

Everyone turns to Nora, stunned. Simon sighs, exhausted.
EXT. SIMON’S BACKYARD -— LATER

In the far reaches of the yard, Simon lays in a hammock with
Bieber the dog. He listens to music and stares up at the
clouds. He checks his e-mail: nothing from Blue. Alice
approaches.

SIMON
(groaning)
No, go away.

ALICE
No.
(then, holds up Oreos)
I have Eggnog Oreos. They’re
disgusting. I've had fifteen.

Simon doesn’t say anything. But he does take out his
earbuds. Alice climbs into the hammock.

SIMON
Just don’t tell mom I’m out here.

They’re quiet for a moment. Finally:

ALICE
I have a boyfriend.

This actually manages to snap Simon out of his daze.

SIMON
What?
84,

ALICE
His name’s Theo. He’s a junior
majoring in classical guitar. And
he has this weird facial hair on
his chin that I should totally hate
but I inexplicably find cute.

SIMON
Oh, god. Like a soul patch?
ALICE
Ughh, yeah. It’s the worst. I
love it.
SIMON

What’s happening right now? You
hate talking about your personal
life.

ALICE
I know. But I figure if you have
the guts to admit you’re gay...
SIMON
You should have the guts to admit
you're straight.

ALICE
You’re funny.

SIMON
I try.

They lie next to each other in silence. It’s the least
excruciating moment of Simon’s day. He eats a cookie.

SIMON (CONT'D)
Yeah, these are awful.

ALICE
I know.

They both reach for another. Denise calls out from inside:

DENISE (0.S.)
Simon, Nick's here!

Simon looks nervous. Alice gives him an encouraging arm
squeeze.

EXT. SIMON’S FRONT PORCH - DAY

Simon steps outside to find Nick pacing back and forth. He
immediately, nervously launches into a pre-rehearsed speech:
85.

NICK
Hey. You weren’t answering any of
our texts and we’re worried about
you. And since I’m the only one of
your best friends lame enough to be
spending the holidays stuck in
Shady Creek, we decided I should
come check in. I have no idea if
that post is true, but if it is--

SIMON
It is.

NICK
Wow. Okay. Do you want to talk
about it?

SIMON
Not really.

NICK
Cool. Cool. What should we talk
about?

SIMON

I don’t know.

They stand in silence for a moment. Finally:

NICK
Oh. So, Leah and I shut it down
before she left for her
grandparents. You were dead wrong
about us. Zero chemistry.

Simon cringes, worried for Leah.

SIMON
Oh. Sorry. Is she ckay?
NICK
Yeah, of course. It was totally

mutual.

Simon nods, unsure whether to believe him. After another

NICK (CONT’D)
(then, remembering)
Oh, here. I got you this. For
Christmas.
86.

He hands Simon a t-shirt. Simon unfolds it, to reveal it
says WORLD’S GREATEST FRIEND, in the style of the WORLD‘S
GREATEST DAD tee Nick was wearing before.

NICK (CONT’D}
(proud)
This one I actually bought.

SIMON
You are such a nerd.

But Simon’‘s clearly very touched.

NICK
Yup. Wanna go for a drive?

SIMON
Actually, I kind of just want to be
alone.

NICK

Nah, let’s go for a drive.

SIMON
Nick-

But Nick’s already bounding towards his car. Simon sighs and
follows after him.

INT. NICK’S MOM’S PRIUS / ATLANTA HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Nick and Simon joyride down the highway, singing/screaming
along to Rihanna.

NICK
He said me haffi-

SIMON
Work, work, work, work, work, work!

NICK
He see me do me-

SIMON
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!

Simon can’t help but grin as the tension of the past couple
of days start to melt away.

INT. / EXT. PRIUS / THE ATLANTA EAGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Nick parks on a Midtown Atlanta street. Simon is confused.
87.

SIMON
Where are we going?

Simon follows Nick’s gaze out the window and realizes they’re
parked outside of a dive bar with a rainbow flag above its
entrance.

Simon turns back to Nick, sees the guilty look on his face
and realizes:

SIMON (CONT’D)
You are insane. No way.

NICK
Come on. This place had great
reviews on Yelp. They’re known for
their ribs!

Simon stares at the bar. He is curious.

SIMON
Okay. But how are we getting in?

NICK
I don’t see anyone checking IDs...

INT. THE ATLANTA EAGLE - NIGHT

Nick and Simon enter a dimly lit space with motorcycle themed
decor. A crowd of older, stocky DUDES wearing lots of
leather drink and dance. This is definitely not Simon‘s
scene.

Simon watches two guys his dad’s age AGGRESSIVELY MAKING OUT
in a dark corner.

NICK
Uh, should we try the ribs?

SIMON
(terrified)
I guess.

A HAIRY GUY in a LEATHER VEST notices Simon’s discomfort.

HAIRY GUY
You might want to try Joe’s.

SIMON
Let’s try Joe’s.
88.

INT. JOE'S ON JUNIPER - NIGHT

Another gay bar/restaurant with a younger crowd - lots of
attractive college-age kids, a DJ spinning Calvin Harris.
Simon and Nick sit at a table eating fries.

NICK
I think that guy is checking me
out.

SIMON
You have said that about every
single guy.

NICK

I can’t help it. The gays love me.

CUTE GUY (0.8.)
Alex?

Simon spins around to come face to face with a boyish CUTE
GUY with cool hair and skinny jeans.

SIMON
I’m not-—
CUTE GUY
You’re not Alex. Sorry, you have
Alex hair.
SIMON
{nervous )

Is that, um, a good thing?

CUTE GUY
It's literally the only good thing
about Alex. Do you want to dance?

Simon hesitates. Nick is grinning like an idiot, beyond
excited by how well this is going.

NICK
Yes. Yes, he does.

Simon's head is exploding with excitement and nerves. He’s
in a public place and an attractive guy is hitting on him.

The Cute Guy takes Simon’s hand and leads him out to the
dance floor.

They awkwardly dance for a moment, before the Cute Guy turns
to a passing WAITER.
89.

CUTE GUY
Two shots of Patron please.

SIMON
(nervous)
Oh, actually-

The WAITER eyes Simon skeptically.

WAITER
I’m gonna need to see some ID.

Off Simon, at a loss...
EXT. JOE'S ON JUNIPER - NIGHT

Simon and Nick are escorted out of the bar by a SECURITY GUY.
Nick feels awful.

NICK
I'm really sorry, man. I dragged
you all the way out here so you
could get humiliated in front of
the first guy who ever asked you to
dance. Please don’t let this
traumatize you-

Simon throws his arms around Nick, exhilarated by their
disastrous night and incredibly grateful for his friendship.

SIMON
Thank you. I love you, man.
(then)
No homo.

Nick and Simon burst out laughing.
INT. SIMON’S ROOM - DAY
Simon sits at his computer, writing to Blue:

SIMON {V.0.)
Dear Blue, happy New Year’s Eve. I
haven't heard from you, so I’m
going to assume slash pray it’s
because you have no service, and
not that you’ve decided it’s too
risky to keep e-mailing your
innermost feelings to a guy who
doesn't know how to log out of
Gmail.

{deep breath, then)
(MORE)
90.
SIMON (V.0.} (CONT'D)
I came out to my entire family on
Christmas. And now, everything is
different.
cur TO:
INT./EXT. SIMON’S CAR / WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)
Simon pulls up to the window to get his order.
SIMON (V.0.)
It’s not like my life has become
one big pride parade.

SIMON
I got the iced coffee.

WAFFLE HOUSE GUY
Yeah you did, boy!

WAFFLE HOUSE GUY hits PLAY on a BOOMBOX and it BLASTS Lady
Gaga's “Born This Way”.

Waffle House Guy throws a bunch of RAINBOW CONFETTI in
Simon's face. Then puts a pair of RAINBOW SUNGLASSES on him.
Simon spits some of the confetti out of his mouth.

BACK TO REALITY:

INT. / EXT. SIMON’S CAR / WAFFLE HOUSE DRIVE THRU — DAY
(PLASHBACK }

Simon pulls up to get his order.

SIMON
I got the iced coffee.

WAFFLE HOUSE GUY
(hands him coffee, bored)
Have a Waffle-icious day.

Simon drives away.

SIMON {V.0.)
It’s the little things.

INT. SIMON’S HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

SIMON (V.0.)
Like the way my mom watches me.
91.

Simon and his entire family wear HAPPY NEW YEAR HATS and
watch Anderson Cooper host a New Year’s Eve celebration on
television. He realizes his mom is STARING at him. She
guickly looks back at the television when Simon catches her.

SIMON (¥.0.)
Or the awkward physical affection
my dad has started to exhibit for
the first time ever.

Jack reaches out and makes the bizarre choice to pat Simon on
the cheek.

BACK TO PRESENT:
INT. SIMON’S ROOM - DAY
Simon continues his e-mail at his desk.

SIMON (V.0.)
Don’t get me wrong, there are good
parts too. My friend even took me
to my first gay bar. It was
terrible and great at the same
time.

INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
A pajama’d Simon packs his bag for school the next day.

SIMON (V.0.)
But change is exhausting. And I
feel like there’s nowhere to hide
from all the new-ness of
everything. Except here. With
you.

Simon sets his alarm and climbs into bed.
SIMON (V.0.)
Please write to me. As soon as you
get even one bar of service. Love,
Jacques.
Simon clicks out the light.
INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM ~ MORNING

Simon's alarm wakes him up. It’s 7:00 AM. He immediately
checks his e-mail. Nothing new from Blue.
92.

INT. SIMON'S BATHROOM —- MORNING

Simon gets ready for his first day of school as an out gay
kid. QUICK CUTS as he tries on a bunch of different T-
shirts, then one tight tank top. He looks at his reflection
like, what am I doing?

INT. SIMON’S KITCHEN - DAY

Simon crosses through, wearing a typical hoodie. He's
visibly nervous.

DENISE
Si, have some breakfast.

Simon makes a beeline for the door.

SIMON
I really can’t eat right now--

DENISE
Wait.

Denise turns on what is clearly her “therapist voice.”

DENISE (CONT’D)
This is going to be a time of real
exploration for you. Sexual and
emotional feelings you‘ve been
repressing for a long time are
going to come to the--

SIMON
(pained)
Mom.

Denise realizes Simon doesn’t need a therapist right now.
And frankly, she doesn’t feel like being one.

DENISE
Sorry.
(then)
Have I ever told you about your
first day of pre-school?

SIMON
Mom-—

DENISE
I was so nervous you were gonna
fall apart when we dropped you off.
You loved being home with your baby
sister so much.

(MORE)
93.

DENISE (CONT'D)

And you’d never been without me or
dad for more than a couple hours.

(beat, then)
But we walked in and you took in
all the kids playing and you
proclaimed, “Hello everybody. I’m
Simon Spier and I’m here!” And
that’s when I realized, my son is
brave.

Simon can’t meet her eyes. He’s not feeling very brave.
Denise’s voice is filled with defiant emotion:

DENISE (CONT'D)
So today, you go in there, and you
remember you’re Simon Spier. And
you say, “Hello everyone. I’m
here.”

Simon and Denise share an emotional look. Then:

DENISE (CONT'D)
(trying to lighten the
mood)
But don’t actually say that.
That’d be weird.

Simon forces a smile and leaves. We hang on Denise, her
smile fading. She could not look more worried for her son.

INT. / EXT. SIMON’S CAR / SHADY CREEK STREETS - MORNING

Simon pulls up in front of Nick’s house. He’s surprised to
see Abby, Nick, and Leah standing on Nick’s front porch.

Simon gets out of the car...
EXT. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
.-.And approaches his friends.

SIMON
Hey, guys. Sorry I’ve been MIA.
Thanks for all the texts.
(re: Nick}
And for sending the friendship
ambassador over to check in.

Simon smiles at them. To his surprise, nobody smiles back.
Nick clears his throat.

NICK
Simon, we need to talk.
94,

Simon realizes that Leah looks very emotional. And Abby
looks very angry.

NICK (CONT'D)
Abby and I hooked up on New Year’s
Eve. And now we're like, together.

SIMON
{nervous}
Wow. That’s awesome.

NICK
Yeah. It is. But then we got to
talking about why it took us so
long.

Simon goes white. He knows where this is going and he tries
to get ahead of it.

SIMON
You guys--—

NICK
Why did tell Abby I had an ex-
girlfriend who I cheated on?

ABBY
And why did you tell Nick I hooked
up with a ton of jacked black guys
at my old school?

They stare at him, really hoping he has a great answer.
Simon takes a deep breath. He attempts to explain himself.

SIMON
Martin's the one who wrote on the
Creeksecrets post about me. He
screenshotted those e-mails and
he’s been using them to blackmail
me for months.

Nick, Leah, and Abby look horrified. But then...

NICK
What does that have to do with us?

SIMON
(pained)
He said if I didn’t help him get
with Abby, he’d out me. So I had
to... keep you guys apart.

Nick and Abby absorb this...
ABBY
So you made up a bunch of lies?

NICK
(realizing)
Oh my god. That’s why you
convinced me to go out with Leah?
To keep me away from Abby?

It takes all of Simon’s effort to look at Leah.
back, overcome with sadness and hurt.

ABBY
(slowly understanding)
So us running lines at Waffle
House? And beer pong at Bram’s
party? All of that was you trying
to pawn me off on Martin?

Simon nods, beyond embarrassed. Abby is livid.

ABBY (CONT’D}
I’m not a piece of meat, Simon.

SIMON
I know. I’m sorry.

ABBY
I would never do anything like that
to you. I would never try and stop
you from being happy.

SIMON
I know.

A horrible, quiet moment. Then:
NICK

We're gonna be late for school.
I’l1l drive.

She looks

Nick takes Abby’s hand and they head towards his car. Leah
hangs back a moment, like she wants to say something to

Simon.

SIMON
Leah, please. You have to
understand...

She shakes her head and follows Nick and Abby.
after them, devastated.

Simon stares

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LOBBY - DAY

Simon enters school, bracing himself for what‘s next in this
shitty day. He comes face to face with...

Life as usual. Students get books out of their lockers,
hurry to class. No one really looks twice at him. Maybe
this won’t be so bad after all.

And then Mr. Worth passes by and points to a RAINBOW FLAG PIN
on his lapel.
MR. WORTH
(in solidarity)
I got you, buddy. Tolerance: it’s
what’s for dinner.

Simon looks uncomfortable. And we begin a SEQUENCE as Simon
experiences his first day as an openly gay student.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - MATH CLASS — DAY
Simon sits in class. He notices Martin staring at him from
his desk. As soon as Simon catches Martin’s eye, Martin
looks away, ashamed.
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
A SENIOR GIRL who has never spoken to Simon corners him.
SENIOR GIRL
We need to be best friends. First
things first: I’m getting a
haircut tomorrow and I’m thinking
bangs. Please weigh in.
Simon just stares at her, clueless.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - BOY'S ROOM - DAY

Simon washes his hands. A PIMPLY FACED KID washes his hands
at the next sink.

PIMPLY FACED KID
Can you pass a paper towel?

Simon hands him a towel. Their hands briefly touch.

PIMPLY FACED KID (CONT’D)
I’m straight.

INT. CREEKWOCOD HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - DAY

A STONER comes up to Simon during volleyball.
97.

STONER
My second cousin is trans.

Simon doesn’t know what to do with this information.

SIMON
Cool?

STONER
Pre-op.

SIMON

Thanks for letting me know.
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - MATH CLASS —- DAY

The Math Teacher drones on. A GOSSIPY GIRL leans over and
whispers to Simon:

GOSSIPY GIRL
So, are you a top or a bottom?

Simon just stares at her, quietly furious.
EXT. CREEKWOOD HIGH -— COURTYARD - DAY

Simon eats lunch alone on a bench. A FRESHMAN DUDE comes up
to him.

FRESHMAN DUDE
Is it because you don’t like the
way pussy smells? I don’t either.
But that doesn’t make me gay,
right?

Simon stares at him, annoyed. The Dude takes his silence to
mean “Yes, you’re gay.”

FRESHMAN DUDE (CONT’D)

(panicking)
Actually, I do like the way it
smells.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH - GYM - DAY
Simon plays volleyball. The Stoner re-approaches him.

STONER
I forgot to tell you that my cousin
started hormones.

SIMON
I don’t care, Evan! I don’t know
your cousin!
98.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY
The Senior Girl rambles on to Simon.

SENIOR GIRL
Jennifer Lawrence pulls off that
leok, but she has a really
symmetrical face, and my left eye
is actually bigger than my right.
Maybe just highlights?

Off Simon...
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - LATER

We're mid-dress rehearsal. The cast performs “I'd Do
Anything”, actually nailing the choreography. Cal and Ms.
Albright excitedly watch from the front row.

As Simon dances onstage, he can’t help but stare at Cal,
searching for any sign that he’s Blue. But Cal’s focused on
the performance, impossible to read.

MARTIN
(singing as Fagin)
Would you rob a shop?

ENSEMBLE
Anything!

MARTIN
Would you risk the-~-

Suddenly, Martin stops singing. Everyone follows his gaze to
the back of the auditorium, where TWO IDIOT JOCKS have
entered. One is dressed in a SHAGGY WIG and GREY HOODIE,
just like Simon. The other is wearing his FOOTBALL JERSEY.

IDIOT JOCK IN JERSEY
This one’s for you, Spier!

He hits a button on his JAMBOX and Ice Cube’s You Can Do It
plays: “You can do it put your back into it! TI can do it put
your ass into it!”

The Jock dressed as Simon gets down on his hands and knees,
and the Jock in the jersey starts humping his butt,
simulating anal sex.

IDIOT JOCK IN JERSEY (CONT’D)
You like that big dick, don’t you
Spier?
99.

IDIOT DRESSED AS SIMON
Oh, yeah! Give it to me, big boy!
Simon likey!

Simon stares at them, stone-faced. This all seems unreal.
He notices Abby’s eyes are locked on the jocks, burning with
rage. But she refuses to make eye contact with Simon.

Suddenly, Taylor CHARGES down the aisle towards the guys.

TAYLOR
Get out of here you ignorant pieces
of-

IDIOT JOCK IN JERSEY
Oh, shiiiit!

The two guys run out of the auditorium, Taylor in hot
pursuit. There’s muffled shouting from the hallway. Ms.
Albright races after them, calling back to the cast:

MS. ALBRIGHT
I’ll be right back.

Everyone sinks to the ground, shell-shocked. Martin covers
his face with his hands.

Ms. Albright returns with a still-fuming Taylor. Simon
remains stiff with shock and discomfort.

MS. ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
I’m sorry you guys had to see that.
Today's rehearsal is cancelled.

Everyone slowly gets up and heads out. Cal gives Simon a sad
smile as he passes. But it’s impossible to tell if he’s Blue
or if he’s just being supportive.

After a moment, Simon turns to Taylor:

SIMON
Um, thanks. And I’m sorry. About
missing a rehearsal. I know how
much this means to you.

Taylor stares at him, surprised.

TAYLOR
It's just a play, Simon.
(then)
Fuck those guys.

He nods, surprised by this other side of Taylor. As Abby
passes Simon, she gives him a stoic:
100.

ABBY
I’m sorry. That was messed up.

But doesn't stop walking. Ms. Albright approaches Simon.

MS. ALBRIGHT
Are you okay?

SIMON
(mortified)
Yes. I’m sorry.

MS. ALBRIGHT
Don't you dare be sorry. None of
this is your fault. Those assholes
are getting suspended. I will make
it my hill to die on.

Simon stares at her, amazed by her candor. He realizes she’s
doing her best to stay calm, but is absolutely furious.
Which makes him feel a little better.

Then, Mr. Worth storms in with the two idiot jocks in tow.
The color drains from Simon’s face.

MR. WORTH
Simon, Devon and Carl have
something to say to you.

SIMON
No. That’s okay--

MR. WORTH
No, it’s not okay. Boys?

IDIOT JOCK IN JERSEY IDIOT DRESSED AS SIMON
Sorry. My bad.

MR. WORTH (CONT'D)
At Creekwood High we believe in
tolerance. Which means, we respect
Simon's choice to love another man.

As Mr. Worth drones on, the Jocks can barely contain their
snickers. Off Simon, completely humiliated...

EXT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

Simon approaches his car to find Martin standing there. He
is the last person Simon wants to see.

MARTIN
Hey, can we talk?
101.

All Simon wants is to get as far away from Creekwood High as
possible.

SIMON
I don’t have anything to say to
you.

Simon reaches for the car door, but Martin is in the way.

SIMON (CONT'D)
Martin-~

MARTIN
I just wanted to say that I’m
sorry. I didn’t know that would -
I didn’t think people still did
shit like that.

Simon stares at Martin, stone-faced.

MARTIN (CONT‘D)
I was pissed off about Abby and I
wasn’t thinking. I didn’t think it
would be a big thing.

Martin struggles to collect his thoughts.

MARTIN (CONT’D)
The whole thing with my brother...
Ever since he came out, my parents
have turned our house into a gay
utopia. But Carter’s in college,
he’s not even home. We marched in
the Pride Parade this year and he
wasn’t even there. It was my idea.
When I told Carter about it, he was
like, “Um, okay, cool.” Like it
was a little much. I felt like a
total asshole. It doesn’t matter.
Will you please say something?

Simon closes his eyes for a moment. Finally:

SIMON
I don’t care about your brother,
Martin. Or how him coming out made
you feel.

(shaking with rage)

And I don’t care if youn didn’t
think my coming out would be “a big
thing.” You don’t get to decide
that. I’m supposed to decide when
and where and who knows and how I
want to say it.
102.

Simon's voice cracks. He shakes away the emotion, refusing
to let Martin see him break down.

SIMON (CONT'D)

Can you please just move away from

my car and leave me the fuck alone?
A devastated Martin walks off inte the night. Simon gets in
his car, locks the doors, and punches his steering wheel with
rage.
INT. SIMON’S ROOM — NIGHT
Simon is pulling on his pajamas, totally exhausted from the
day, when his computer BINGS. He races over and checks his e-
mail - Blue! Simon nervously opens the message and begins to
read:

CAL (V.0.)
You’re right. I know who you are.

curt TO:
INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH - AUDITORIUM - DAY (SIMON’S FANTASY)
Cal stands center stage, staring straight into camera.

CAL
Jacques a dit, right?

CUT TO:
EXT. PARIS - LUXEMBOURG PARK - DAY (FLASHBACK)

EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SIMON and his family are on a Parisian
vacation.

The framed photo in Simon’s room that inspired his pseudonym
“Jacques” was taken on this trip.

A group of FRENCH KIDS play “Jacques a dit” in the park.
DENISE

Jacques a dit is what they cali

Simon Says in French. Just like

you, kiddo.
Off Young Simon...

BACK TO:

INT. SIMON’S ROOM - NIGHT

Simon stands there reading the e-mail.
103.

CAL (V.0.)
I’m sorry, Simon. I can’t do this
anymore. I’m so sorry.

Simon stares at his computer in dazed shock. He hurriedly
writes back:

SIMON (V.0.)
Please, Blue. You can’t leave me
alone. Everything’s falling apart.

And hits send. A beat, then his computer BINGS again with a
response from MAILER DAEMON.

AUTOMATED VOICE (V.0.)

Delivery to the recipient

bluegreenl18@gmail.com failed

permanently.
Blue deleted the account.
Simon stares at the word “permanently” for a beat, as he
realizes Blue shut down the account. Then, he slams his
computer shut.

He notices the WORLD’S GREATEST FRIEND t-shirt Nick gave him,
strewn on a chair.

And it’s all just too much. He picks up the shirt, buries
his head in it, and begins to sob.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKERS

Cal is putting books in his locker. Simon walks up to him.
He's bleary eyed, clearly having been up most of the night.

SIMON
Hey.

CAL
Hey, what’s up?

Simon takes a deep breath. Then, in a shaky voice:

SIMON
Is it you?
CAL
(confused)
Is what me?

Simon stares at him for a long beat. Then:
104.

SIMON
(barely audible)
Blue?

Cal looks uncomfortable.

CAL
Simon, are you okay? I know you’ve
had a crazy couple days. Do you
wanna talk about it? I can skip
Bio, I’m failing anyway.

Cal gives him a friendly smile. Simon stares at him. It’s
clear to him that Cal is not Blue after all. After a moment:

SIMON
No. It’s okay. I’m okay. Sorry
to bother you.

Simon hurries away, embarrassed. Elliott Smith kicks in,
coming from the stereo of...

INT. / EXT. SIMON’S CAR / WAFFLE HOUSE DRIVE THRU - DAY
Where Simon gets an after school iced coffee for one.
INT. / EXT. SIMON’S CAR / SHADY CREEK STREETS - DAY

Simon drives home alone, passing a field where WORKERS are
setting up CARNIVAL RIDES, including an OLD FERRIS WHEEL.

INT. / EXT. SIMON’S CAR / CREEKWOOD STREETS - DAY
Simon turns onto his street when he spots Leah on her bike.

He makes a decision, rolls down his window and slows down so
he’s driving next to her.

SIMON
Can we talk?
(off her silence)
Leah, please. I know what I did
was messed up. I knew you were in
love with Nick and I--

LEAR
Stop it!

Leah pulls her bike over. Simon parks, gets out, approaches.
Leah closes her eyes and lowers her voice:

LEAH (CONT‘D)
You are insanely stupid, Simon. I
was never in love with Nick.

(MORE )
105.

LEAH (CONT’D)
(then)
I was in love with you.

Leah angrily brushes away tears. Simon stares at her,
totally blindsided.

SIMON
What? But we're... us.

LEAH
Yeah, well. Sorry.

Simon doesn’t know what to say.

LEAH (CONT'D)
I thought you were into Abby. And
then when you told me I should go
out with Nick, I realized you were
never gonna see me that way.

Leah takes a deep breath then presses on:

LEAH (CONT’D)
I can deal with you being gay.
{beat)
But you set me up to get my heart
broken when you thought I was in
love with Nick. And that makes you
cruel.

Simon has never felt worse in his young life.

SIMON
Leah, please. I was desperate.

LEAH
I know, you didn't want anyone to
know you were gay--

SIMON
No, it wasn't just that. I fell in
love with someone. The guy in the
e-mails, I love him. And I knew if
Martin leaked our e-mails it would
scare him off. I’ve been so lonely
for so long. And and with him, I
didn’t feel lonely...

Simon trails off. Leah softens, starting to forgive Simon..

LEAH
I’m sorry.
106.

SIMON
No, I’m sorry. It’s not an excuse.
You're my best friend.

LEAH
If I'm your best friend, why did
you come out to Abby and not me?

Simon considers.

SIMON
It was easier. I’ve known Abby for
three months. I’ve known you for
thirteen years. And I knew that
once I told you, everything would
be different. And I loved things
the way they were.

Leah nods. These two can feel their friendship changing
before their very eyes. And it hurts. But they know they
need to try and embrace it. So:

LEAH
Tell me about this guy you love.

Simon hesitates.

SIMON
Are you sure?

LEAH
Yeah. It’1l help me kill off
Hetero Simon in my mind.

 

SIMON
Well, you don’t have to kill him
off--

LEAH

He’s dead, Si. Hacking him up with
a mental machete as we speak.

SIMON
Fair enough. So, I call him Blue.

Leah forces a smile. And we leave these two, trying to
adjust to their new normal...

INT. / EXT. JACK’S CAR / SHADY CREEK STREETS - NIGHT

Jack and Simon drive home with THAI FOOD in uncomfortable
silence.
107.

JACK
Thanks for coming with me to pick
up the food.

SIMON
Mhmm.

JACK
If I get one more ticket for double
parking outside Wakdongmoonlek
Noodle, we can’t afford to send you
to college.

Simon forces a smile. It’s clearly still awkward between
these two. Jack presses on.

JACK (CONT’D)
Excited for the show tomorrow
night?

SIMON
Uh huh.

JACK
Mom and Nora and I are really
leoking forward to it.
(beat, then)
You gonna go to the carnival after?

SIMON
Yup.

JACK
(forcing conversation)
I’ve always loved the winter
carnival. One of my favorite Shady
Creek traditions.

Simon nods. Another awkward silence. Then:
JACK (CONT‘D)
So, that Sam Smith guy is pretty
cool, huh?

Simon stares at his dad, worried about where this is going...

SIMON
Uh huh.

JACK
I’ve actually been really into his
tunes lately.
108.

Jack hits the STEREO and Sam Smith’s Stay With Me begins to
play. Jack awkwardly bobs along with it.

SIMON
Dad, did you tee up a gay singer
just to talk to me about being gay?

Jack sighs, frustrated with himself. He turns off the music.
Simon notices his hand is trembling a little.

JACK
(quietly)
I'm sorry, Si. For ail the gay
jokes.
SIMON
It's fine.
JACK
(firmly)

No. It’s not.

Jack sounds so angry and ashamed with himself. Simon
realizes how much he's been beating himself up.

JACK (CONT’D)
I'm just going to put this out
there, in case the message got lost
somewhere. I love you. A lot.
(beat)
And I’m really proud of you.

SIMON
(re: proud)
Why?
JACK
For coming out on your terms. You
really took control of your
destiny.

Simon stares out the window. He couldn’t possibly feel in
less control of his destiny.

Jack clears his throat. After a beat:

JACK (CONT'D)
So, are there any special guys-—-

Simon turns back on Sam Smith. Jack gets the message.
109.

INT. SIMON’S ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Simon lies in bed, wide awake. He clicks on the light, goes
to his desk, navigates to the Creeksecrets Tumblr.

He grabs an Eggnog Oreo from a nearby pack, clicks on NEW
POST, and begins to TYPE.

SIMON (V.0.)
Dear Students of Creekwood High
School, As anyone with a half-
decent data plan already knows, a
recent post on this very website
declared that I was gay. The
delivery left something to desired,
but the message is true. I am.
Gay.

EXT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT STEPS - THE NEXT MORNING

Students head into school, glued to their phones. Everyone
is reading Simon’s post.

SIMON (V.0.)
For a long time, I was bending over
backwards to hide that fact. I had
all these reasons. It was unfair
that only gay people had to come
out. I was sick of change. But
the truth is, I was terrified.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Ms. Albright reads Simon's post on her phone as an EAGER
DRAMA STUDENT hangs an OLIVER: TONIGHT! banner. The Student
checks with Ms. Albright for approval, but she’s totally
focused on her phone.

SIMON (V.0.)
Announcing who you are to the world
is terrifying. Because... what if
the world doesn’t like you?

EXT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COURTYARD - DAY

Nick and Abby read Simon’s post as they sip iced coffees on a
bench.

SIMON {V.0.)
So, I did whatever I could to keep
my secret. I hurt people. I hurt
the best, most important people. I
want them to know that I’m sorry.

about anything in my life.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - EMPTY ART CLASS - DAY
Leah has stopped SKETCHING A DRESS to read Simon’s post.

being terrified.

Leah smiles, proud of Simon.
INT. / EXT. SIMON’S CAR / CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Simon pulls into a parking spot. He takes a deep breath and
gets out of the car to face his school.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LOBBY - DAY

Simon heads to his locker. He’s met with nods of
recognition, a few pats on the back, a fist pound. He shyly
accepts it all, a little overwhelmed by the attention.

SIMON (V.0.)
I'm done living in a world where I
don’t get to be who I am.

(beat)
And I’m done living in a world
where I don’t get to have a great
love story.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Nora stands at her locker, reading the post on her phone.

SIMON (V.0.)
Disclaimer: this is about to get
romantic as eff, so anyone averse
te gratuitous feelings, kindly
click over to a Buzzfeed quiz or
resume the porn you paused to read
this.

Nora smiles. Mr. Worth notices Nora on her phone and beckons
for it. She stares him down. He gives her a “never mind”
gesture and hurries away.

Nora sends an e-mail on her phone...
111.

INT. ALICE'S BARD DORM ROOM - DAY

Alice sits on her bed, eating Oreos and studying. Her phone
dings and she looks at it. Nora has forwarded her Simon's
post. She starts to read.

SIMON (V.0.)
This guy that I love once wrote
that he felt like he was stuck on a
ferris wheel. On top of the world
one minute, at rock bottom the
next. That’s how I feel now. I
couldn’t ask for better friends. A
more understanding family. But
none of it means anything if I
can’t share it with him.

Alice’s SOUL PATCHED BOYFRIEND enters from the next room and
sits down on the bed. She leans into him as she continues
reading.

INT. CREEKWCOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - LATER

We're at the end of the Oliver performance. The entire
company BOWS to a STANDING OVATION.

SIMON (V.0.)
So, guy I love, after the play
tonight, at 10:00, you know where
I’1l be.

Simon scans the crowd, looking at all the HIGH SCHOOL GUYS in
the audience, wondering if any of them are Blue. If he‘ll
ever find out who Blue is.

SIMON (¥.0.)
There’s no pressure for you to show
up. dust because I can’t wait a
second longer to grand gesture the
crap out of you doesn’t mean you
have to be ready for all that.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - OUTSIDE AUDITORIUM - LATER

Simon receives FLOWERS from his family after the show. Nora
gives him a big hug, proud of him for his Creeksecrets post.

Simon looks around and sees lots of STRAIGHT COUPLES
congratulating each other and kissing. Sure, he’s surrounded
by people who love him, but he feels very much alone.
112.

SIMON (V.0.)
But I hope you are. Because you
deserve a great love story too.
And I sure would like to meet you.

INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE
Simon finishes writing his post.

SIMON (V.0.)
Sincerely, Simon Spier.

Simon posts the same stock image of the ferris wheel from
Blue’s original Creeksecrets post and hits SEND.

INT. CREEKWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - OUTSIDE AUDITORIUM - PRESENT

Nick and Abby approach Simon and his family. Simon is
immediately uncomfortable.

ABBY
Hey, Spiers.

JACK
(bad British accent)
Great job, Dodge. Stay away from
my wallet!

Abby forces a laugh.

NICK
Simon, do you need a ride to the
carnival?

Simon stares at them, hopeful. Abby rolls her eyes and gives
him a smile like, “We’re fine.” Simon throws his arms around
them, very emotional. Jack and Denise exchange a confused
look.

DENISE
He never does that when I offer him
a ride.

EXT. WINTER CARNIVAL - NIGHT
Simon, Nick, Abby, and Leah walk through a bustling old-
school carnival with rickety rides and candy apples and

rigged games. It seems like the whole town is there.

Simon checks his watch and gives his friends a nod. It’s
time. They hug him. And then, he takes off on his own.
113.

EXT. WINTER CARNIVAL ~ FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

Simon boards the ferris wheel, giving the OPERATOR a HANDFUL
OF RIDE TICKETS.

SIMON
This should last a while.

The ride starts. A pair of CREEKWOOD GIRLS notice Simon
riding alone.

CREEKWOOD GIRL
Oh my god, look.

OTHER CREEKWOCD GIRL
I bet he’s waiting for the other
gay kid. That’s romantic as shit.
Where’s Dana, she’ll love this.

Off Simon, realizing he’s been noticed...

cut TO:
EXT. WINTER CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - LATER
A crowd of CREEKWOOD STUDENTS has gathered below the ferris
wheel, waiting to see if Simon’s significant other will show
up. Everyone we've met from school is there: Nora, Nick,
Abby, Leah, Taylor, Bram, Garrett, Lyle. Plus plenty of

others. Every now and then someone calls out something like:

SUPPORTIVE GUY
Hang in there!

Or:

SENIOR GIRL
We love you, Simon!

Simon hates the attention. Nora goes into defensive sister
mode, trying to get rid of the crowd below.

NORA
Don’t you people have anything
better to do? Go get candy cotton
and make out with each other.

ABBY
You heard the woman, move people!

But no one moves.

TIME CUTS as Simon continues to ride, realizing that if Blue
doesn’t show up, his humiliation will now be quite public.
114.

Happy couples get on and off the ride. Whenever the ferris
wheel stops, Simon looks at the line hopefully. But no one
joins him in his car.

EXT. WINTER CARNIVAL — FERRIS WHEEL - LATER

Simon checks his watch - it’s 10:28. He's been at this for
almost half an hour. The ride comes to a stop.

OPERATOR
That was your last ride ticket,
buddy.

SIMON
Okay.

Simon stands up when Martin races out of the crowd.
MARTIN
(to Operator)
One more. On me.

Martin hands the Operator a five dollar bill, shoots Simon a
quick look, and returns to the crowd.

Everyone watches as the Operator loads new passengers onto
the ferris wheel, waiting to see if Simon’s guy will show.

NICK
Oh, god. I can’t watch.

The Operator fills up the ride, then yells out:

OPERATOR
Last cali for the ferris wheel!

The Operator goes to close the rope and start the ride, when-

GUY'S VOICE (0.8.)
Wait!

Simon looks up to see BRAM GREENFIELD standing at his ferris
wheel car. He looks terrified.

BRAM
Can I sit here?
SIMON
Uh, I’m kind of waiting for

someone.

Bram sits next to Simon. The Creekwood Students watching
hold their breaths.
115.

BRAM
I know.

Simon is confused. He stares at Bram. Then:

SIMON
It’s... you?

BRAM
It’s me.

The Operator starts up the ride.

SIMON
But at your party you were-—

BRAM
({wincing)
Sorry about that. I was drunk and
confused. It ended like a minute
after you saw us-—

SIMON
(gently)
It's fine.
(then)
I didn’t think you’d come.

BRAM

Me neither. Until I was walking
towards you I didn’t think I had it
in me.

(beat)
But you’re right. I do deserve a
great love story.

(then, suddenly

vulnerable)
Are you... disappointed? That it’s
me?

Simon stares at Bram.

Then, he leans over and KISSES him. Bram is shocked. But he
gives into it and kisses back.

Their moment is interrupted by WHISTLING and CATCALLS.
They look below and realize the Creekwood students are
enthusiastically cheering for them. They both blush and

cover their faces, overcome with a mix of embarrassment and
utter joy.

Little Secrets, the song from our opening, taking us to...
