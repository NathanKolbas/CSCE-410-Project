MR. DESTINY

TITLE SUPER OVER BLACK: "MR. DESTINY"

LARRY
(voice-over)
The dictionary defines Destiny as
a person’s ultimate lot in
life...I‘m pretty sure my ultimate
lot in life was to be a shmuck...

The SOUND OF LOUD CHEERING STARTS.
FADE IN

EXT. BASEBALL PARK DAY (1970) 1
TITLE SUPER: "1970" .
Establish "STEDMAN FIELD" stadium. .
The stands are PACKED with CHEERING FANS.

LARRY
(voice-over)
It was the all-state high school
championship game. Bottom of the
ninth, two out.

PLAYERS in both dugouts are straining forward, SHOUTING.
The PLAYERS on the field are in tight.

LARRY
(voice-over)
Fenwick was standing on third like
it was getting set to explode under
his feet.

A 15 year-old, FENWICK, is anxiously poised on third base.

LARRY
(voice-over)
Fillmore High had us by a run, and
it was a 3-1 count. The championship
had come down to one batter: yours
truly, Larry Burrows.

LARRY BURROWS, 15 years of age, is at home plate waiting
for the pitch. He spits, but it catches on his chin. He
wipes it off and glances sheepishly at the catcher.

The TEAM COACH, 35, is pacing in the dugout.

(CONTINUED)
=2-

CONTINUED:

COACH
Let’s go, Larry! Swing away, swing
away! You can do it, Larry! Watch
the infield, babe!

There is an intense look of concentration on Larry’s face.

LARRY
(voice-over)
Haskins was throwing fastballs,
because that was the only pitch he
ever threw...so I was ready for the
next one.

The Pitcher, JERRY HASKINS, 16, winds up and throws.

Larry swings: CRACK! A towering fly, going deep! Looks ilike
it’s out of the park.

LARRY
(voice-over)
I swung perfect, got great wood,
and hung it up there like it was
heading for Mars.

A ROAR from the crowd.

But no! No! NO! It curves foul! By mere inches!
LARRY
(voice-over)
Then this gust of wind came up outa
nowhere and nudged it foul. I swear
to God, a gust of wind!

Larry steps out of the batter’s box, frustrated.

The scoreboard turns over: 3 and 2.

Larry twists the bat in his hands, getting a good grip.
The players in Larry’s dugout strain forward.

CLIP METZLER, a curly-haired 15-year old nerd, and the
resident "bench-warmer", leans out of the dugout, clapping.

CLIP
Paste it, Lare! You can do it!
c’mon, Lare! Have-an-eye,
have-an-eye, have~an-eye, soo-wing,
babe!

(CONTINUED)
=3-

CONTINUED: (2)

Larry steps back into the box, digs his sneakers into the
dirt, sets the bat, and squints down at the pitcher, looking
tough.
_ LARRY
(voice-over)

Why is it, when you do something

terrific, nine times outa ten,

you’re all alone? But when you screw

up really big...the whole world

is watching?

The crowd is on its feet with anticipation.
Haskins goes into his wind-up and throws.

SLOW MOTION: the ball breaks RIGHT AT THE CAMERA, straight
and hard, coming closer and closer and closer.

LARRY’S POV: As the ball hurtles towards him, a SWELL OF
LIGHT SEEMS TO EMERGE FROM BEHIND IT. Larry blinks. -

The ball closes in. Larry swings with all his might.
The ball THUDS LIKE A THUNDERCLAP into the catcher’s mitt.

UMPIRE
Steeee-rike Thur-eeee!!!

Larry‘’s swing twists him around and he falls in the dirt.
Silence. The crowd stares in disappointment and horror.

(MOS) The other team races out onto the field and hoists
Haskins on their shoulders.

Larry sits up, wiping dirt off his face and winces with the
pain of failure and shame.
LARRY
(voice-over)
It was a perfect pitch. A pitch from
God. Had my name all over it. And
I missed. I really missed.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LARRY’S GARAGE ~ DAY (1990) -

LARRY, now 35, is in his garage workshop, staring into
space, lost in thought.

(CONTINUED)
=4-

CONTINUED:

LARRY
I still can’t get over it. I was
sure I/d hit it. It was like the
ball went right through the bat!
(breaking his reverie)
Ever have anything like that happen
to you, Sammy?

Re looks down at his MONGREL DOG, SAMMY, for an answer. The
dog stares back attentively and BARKS.

LARRY
Then you know what I mean.

Larry goes back to gluing the tire on the immaculate model
of a ’54 Porsche Spyder he was working on.
i
LARRY | ,
Some memories just don’t want to
go away I guess.

VOICE
(9.s.7 echoing)
You tipped that ball foul, Larry.
Everybody saw it.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM DAY (1970)

Larry is sitting in the deserted locker room, head down,
staring at the floor.

VOICE
That ump was blind as a bat! So I
got him some glasses. What d’ya
think?

He looks up. Clip Metzler, the "bench warmer", turns around:
he’s wearing a pair of "slinky glasses". The “eyes" bob
wildly back and forth.

cLIP
Aren’t they cool? Scared the crap
out of my baby sister. Wanna try
fem on?

Clip takes the glasses off and holds them out to Larry.
LARRY
Thanks Clipper, but I’d kinda like
to be alone for awhile.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

CLIP
Sure, Lare. Whatever you say.

Clip starts away, then turns back, still cheery.

CLIP
Listen, I’1l call ya later. Well
go to a movie or something. Maybe
we'll see "Bonnie and Clyde" again.
Okay?

Larry nods. Clip leaves. Then Larry puts his head down. He
winces, trying to hold back the tears.

He HEARS the BANG of the door opening and he looks up to
SEE the ballpark custodian, MR. RIPLEY come in. With him
is his daughter, ELLEN, a pretty 16-year old. i

Larry quickly tries te straighten up.

MR. RIPLEY .
Tough break, son. But don’t take
it too hard. There’1l be other
games. Remember, none of this’11
seem so important twenty years from
now.

LARRY
Yeah...sure.

The young girl hands Larry a handkerchief.

ELLEN
Here. Looks like you could use one
of these.

LARRY

Oh, thanks. I must have gotten
something in my eye...all the dust

and stuff...

ELLEN .
Yeah, there is alot of dust blowing
around.

Larry dabs his eyes then hands the handkerchief back.

LARRY
Thanks.

ELLEN
It’s okay, you can keep it. I got
lots. My aunt sends me six dozen
every Christmas.

Larry looks at the handkerchief TO SEE the initials EJR.

LARRY
What’s E.J.R.?

ELLEN
Ellen Jane Ripley. What’s your name?

LARRY
Larry. Larry Joseph Burrows.

They shake hands. She smiles at him.

ELLEN
Nice to meet you, Larry.

INT. LARRY’S GARAGE DAY (1990) *

Larry is looking at the handkerchief with the faded initials
EIR.

VOICE
la , (o.s.}
rry!

He comes out of his reminiscence and turns to SEE: A WOMAN,
standing in the doorway. It’s the adult version of the 16
year-old girl in the flashback.

LARRY
What?

ELLEN
I’ve been calling you for the last
five minutes.

LARRY
Sorry, I didn’t hear you.

Ellen SEES the handkerchief in his hand.
ELLEN
(knowingly}
Were you thinking about that silly
baseball game again?
He hides the handkerchief and holds up the model.

(CONTINUED)
4 CONTINUED:

LARRY
No, of course not. I was working
on the ‘54 Porsche Spyder. See?

She looks at him, disbelieving.

LARRY
I was! Really! Ain’t it a beaut?
dames Dean had one of these, you
know. Course, his was much bigger...

ELLEN
It was 20 years ago, Larry. I really
don’t think anybody cares anymore.

LARRY
I care. James Dean was a great
actor. Remember that drunk scene
in "Giant"...

ELLEN
You know what I’m talking about.
That baseball game’s in the past.
It‘s not important, anymore.

LARRY
Of course it isn’t. I know that.
You’re the one who brought it up.
Now what was it you wanted? Is
breakfast ready?

ELLEN
The contractor is here.

LARRY
Great! I love the contractor.

He places the Porsche on a shelf, beside an
already-completed model of a ’34 Dusenberg.

ELLEN
You/1l be firm with him this time,
won’t you?

LARRY
Don’t worry. "Firm" is my middle
name. Larry "firm" Burrows they call

me...

ELLEN
Well, you weren’t very firm the last
time...

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

LARRY
Yeah, well, who can remember back
that far?

ELLEN

Just be firm with him.

Ellen straightens the collar of his shirt.

LARRY
Don‘t worry. "Firm" is my middle
name. Larry "firm"...

ELLEN

(gently)
Yeah, we heard...

EXT. LARRY’S HOUSE DAY

Establish the house: a partially-built modest home in a new
subdivision.

Larry comes out of the garage to meet GUZELMAN, a 300 lb
Armenian, who munches a jelly donut and sips a coffee.

LARRY
(good~naturedly)
Hey, Mr. Guzelman! How’re you?
Haven’t seen you the past six weeks.
Thought you’d been captured by
aliens.

GUZELMAN
“Got your message, what’sa problem?

LARRY
Well...it’s the driveway.

GUZELMAN
S’wrong with it?

Larry looks down; he and Guzelman are standing in a very
muddy driveway.

LARRY
Well, I tell you...it’s a little
muddier than we thought it‘d be.
You think maybe we could pave it?

GUZELMAN
Can‘t pave it ‘til all the mud’s
gone.

(CONTINUED)
-9-

5 CONTINUED:

LARRY
Well...then all we have to do is
get rid of the mud, right?

GUZELMAN
Don’t do mud. You need a mud guy
for that.

LARRY

A mud guy? They have that?

GUZELMAN
Yup. Anything else?

LARRY
Well, now that you mention it, there
are a few other things, like the
plumbing and the wiring which don’t
seem to wanna work.

GUZELMAN
Gonna need a check for that.

LARRY
I thought I gave you a check last
month. For a thousand bucks.

GUZELMAN
Need another one. Gotta hire a whole
crew for a job like this.

: LARRY

Well, if I give you another check,
when do you think you’1ll get around
to doing the work?

GUZELMAN
Soon.

LARRY
I think that’s what you said last
month, Mr. Guzelman and nothing

happened.
GUZELMAN
Got busy on another job.
LARRY

Listen, ya know, there’s gotta be
plenty of other contractors around.
If you’re too busy maybe I should...

GUZELMAN
Suit yourself.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
Guzelman starts to walk away.

LARRY
Alright, wait, wait. How much do
you need this time?

GUZELMAN
Thousand.

LARRY
Don’t you guys know any other
number?

GUZELMAN
Two thousand.

LARRY b
Okay, okay, a thousand. v

Larry quickly writes out a check.
LARRY
Couldja at least gimme a rough
estimate of what "soon" means. Is

that next week? Next month?
Sometime this century?

GUZELMAN
Soon. .

Guzelman grabs the check and gets into his truck.

LARRY
Sure ya won’t stay for breakfast?

Guzelman backs his truck out of the driveway, splattering
mud on Larry.

LARRY |
Try cashin’ that check, ya fat piece
a crap.
The truck slides to a halt.

GUZELMAN
Wuzzat?!

LARRY
I said...see ya when ya get back!

Larry smiles and waves as Guzelman pulls away.

INT. LARRY‘S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM DAY
Larry enters, sorting through the mail.

LARRY
Ellen, did you forget to pay the
electric again? We got a cut-off
notice!

He flips on the TV.

LARRY
It's okay. TV still works.

The TV is tuned to a workout show: THREE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
thrust their pelvises toward the CAMERA.

Larry pauses to watch, lust flashing in his eyes.

LARRY
My God! How do they do that?
(ealling out)
Hey honey, can you do this thing
with your leg where you put it
behind your...?

He turns to see Ellen enter carrying a bucket of water.

LARRY
What?

She points to a large yellow stain in the corner.
ELLEN
Sammy’s been decorating the room
again.
Sammy peeks in sheepishly from the other room.
Ellen hands Larry the bucket and a sponge; then she exits.
Larry looks over at Sammy.

LARRY
Thanks, Sammy.

Sammy backs out sheepishly.

INT. LARRY’S HOUSE ~ KITCHEN DAY
Ellen is frying eggs at the stove.

Larry comes in, opening the mail.

Sammy watches them back and forth as they talk, neither
listening to the other.

ELLEN
I thought you said you were going
to take Sammy to obedience school.

LARRY
What’s with this Mastercard bill?

ELLEN
You can’t just bring a dog in off
the street and expect him to be
housebroken, ya know.

LARRY .
What the hell is Neiman Marcus? And 4
why do we owe them 250 bucks?

Ellen reaches down and slips Sammy a piece of bacon,

ELLEN
(baby-talk)
He‘s a mean old Larry for not
teaching you to pee on the front
lawn, isn’t he, Sammy? Yes he is.

LARRY
What‘d you buy for two-fifty anyway,
a mink coat or something?

ELLEN
Did you use the Lysol on the carpet?
The smell never goes away if you

don’t.
LARRY

What are you talking about?
ELLEN

The Lysol. What are you talking

about?

Larry and Ellen stare at one another.

8 EXT. HOUSE DAY

Larry gets into his car. Sammy jumps through the window into
the passenger seat, excited and wagging his tail.

LARRY
Sorry, Sammy. Not today. Gotta go
make some money.

Sammy looks disappointed.
Larry pets him and kisses him on the nose.

LARRY
Okay, okay. We’ll go driving on the
weekend. You can stick your head
out the window and drool down the
side of the car and everything.
How’s that?

Sammy licks Larry’s face.

LARRY
(baby~talk)
Yes, and I love you too.

INT.. LARRY’S STATION WAGON DAY 9

Elien is putting on her make-up as Larry drives.

They pull up to a stop sign. The engine RUMBLES, BACKFIRES,
then STALLS. Larry sits a moment, calmly.

LARRY
This car’s a piece of shit, Ellen.

ELLEN
I know but if you shift into neutral
just as you’re about to stop and
keep your foot on the gas, it won’t
stall.

LARRY
And when the brakes go, I suppose
we'll just drag our feet out the
doors.

ELLEN
I don’t think that would work very
well, Larry.

Larry starts the car and pulls away.

INT. STATION WAGON ~ ANOTHER STREET DAY 10

Ellen looks out the window as they drive by a boarded-up
miniature golf course called "The Golf of Mexico" with a
large, battered sombrero over the sign. Anew sign is being
hoisted that READS: "Future Home of Mr. Croissant".

ELLEN
I don’t believe it. Look. They‘re
going to tear down "The Golf of
Mexico." That’s where we went on
our first date. Remember?

LARRY
Wasn’t that our second date?

ELLEN
No, it was our first date. I
remember specifically because the
sombrero kept slipping down over
your eyes and you tripped over the
grinning bandito and split your
pants. '

LARRY Y
I thought our first date was at Mr.
Pizza. I remember because you
ordered anchovies and were belching
all night.

ELLEN
(laughs)
That was our third date. And I just
burped a few times.

LARRY
Then where was our second date?

ELLEN
(thinks)
I can’t remember. I guess nothing
exciting happened that time.

They HEAR the WAIL OF A SIREN and look back to SEE: A
HELMETED MOTORCYCLE COP pointing him toward the curb.

LARRY
(groaning)
Is that for me? It can’t be for
speeding. Not in this piece of
shit!

Larry pulls over. The engine RUMBLES, BACKFIRES then STALLS.

ELLEN
Just be nice and he’1l be nice back.

EXT. ROADSIDE DAY il
Larry rolls down his window, smiling pleasantly.

The Motorcycle Cop, early 50s, peers in. (THIS IS THE FIRST
INCARNATION OF MR. DESTINY.)

LARRY
Morning, Officer. Is something
wrong?

coP

Your vehicle is emitting dangerous
levels of hydrocarbons, sir.

LARRY
It is? Well, I’ll certainly get that
fixed right away, officer. Thank
you very much for pointing it out.

cop
I’m sorry, but I’1l have to issue :
a citation. License and
registration please.

Larry reaches for his wallet.
LARRY
(to Ellen)

Nice didn’t work too well, did it?

He hands the cop his license and registration.

cop
Thank you, Mr. uh, Burrows.

The cop is about to go back to his motorcycle, then stops
and turns back to Larry.

COP
Burrows? Burrows? I know that name.
There was a guy named Burrows who
blew the highschool championship
back in 1970. Was that you?

Larry winces.

LARRY
Uh, no. That was, uh...another guy
named Burrows.

ELLEN
(cheerfully)
He’s the one alright!

Larry looks over at Ellen: Thanks a lot.

@ 12 EXT. PARKING LOT DAY 12

The station wagon pulls into the huge parking lot of
“LIBERTY REPUBLIC SPORTING GOODS", a large, suburban~based
manufacturing and distribution complex. The engine RUMBLES,
BACKFIRES, then STALLS.

Larry and Ellen get out of the station wagon.

ELLEN
Are you still mad?

LARRY
Why should I be mad? If you enjoy
making a fool out of me in front
of policemen, that’s perfectly fine
with me.

ELLEN
Come on, sweeheart. I was just é
teasing. You take that baseball”
stuff way too seriously.

LARRY *
Don’t worry about it. It’s already
forgotten.

@ He starts walking away.

ELLEN
Don’t I get a kiss?
He comes back. They kiss lightly.

LARRY
See you after work.

ELLEN
Oh, I forgot. I’m gonna be late
tonight. There’s a union meeting.

LARRY
Again?

ELLEN
We're electing a Strike Committee
and they want me to be the chairman.
Somebody’s gotta stop those
management bastards from laying

But today’s my birthday...

He turns towards the office building.

LARRY
I guess she forgot.

INT. LARRY’S CUBICLE DAY 13

cU: Larry is doodling on a pad: a drawing of a stick man
drowning in an ocean and screaming for help as a big shark
fin comes up beside him.

“VOICE
How they hangin’, Lare?

Larry looks up to SEE The Company President, JACKIE EARLE
BUMPUS, 40, a large back-slapping sort-of guy.

Larry crumples up the drawing and leaps to his feet.

LARRY
Good morning, Mr. Bumpus. They‘re
hanging just fine, sir. _

JACKIE EARLE
Good. And lay off the Mr. Bumpus
crap, Lare. We’re all on the same
team here. When I played for the
Bears they called me Cementhead.
But you can call me Jackie.

LARRY
Yes, sir. Jackie, sir.

As Jackie Earle talks, behind him Larry SEES the face of
CLIP METZLER, the "nerdy benchwarmer" from the flashback,

reports, Lare. Damn good work. A
real touchdown.

LARRY
Thank you, sir. Just doing my job.

Clip continues goofing around behind Jackie trying to make
Larry laugh: .pantomiming walking down stairs, pretending
to hang himself with his tie, mouthing Jackie’s words etc.

JACKIE EARLE

An@ don’t think I don’t appreciate

it. You know a quarterback’s only

as good as his linemen. Hell, I’m

just a big old dumb jock who got i
lucky and married the boss’ . .
daughter. It’s guys like you who

_ make me look like a hotshot.

.
Clip is in the b.g. strutting around like a "hotshot".
Larry can't resist and a laugh snorts out of his nose.

LARRY
Sorry sir. I guess I’m coming down
with a cold or something.

JACKIE EARLE

Know what’s good for that, Lare?
Eucalytpus extract and honey in two
ounces of warm Napoleon Brandy with
a tablespoon of rosehips and a dash
of cayenne pepper. Then get into

a hot bath for 15 minutes, and put
a damp cloth soaked in lemon juice
over your face. Got all that?

LARRY
Got it, sir. Extract, honey
and...al1 those other things...

Jackie Earle stands up to leave.
JACKIE EARLE
Atta boy. Well, keep up the good
work, Lare, and good luck with the
cold. I just stopped by to see how
you’re doing.

JACKIE EARLE

Clip enters the cubicle.

LARRY
Thanks a lot, Clip. I’m trying to
get a promotion and all you can do
is goof around.

CLIP
Will you relax, Mr. .
Worried-about~every-~little-thing.
Your suck-points are safe. Old

Cementhead didn’t notice a thing. .
foo many hits on the helmet if you
ask me.

LARRY

oh, his heart’s in the right place.
CLIP
Yeah, but we’re not sure where his
brains are.
Clip tosses a package on Larry’s desk.

CLIP
Here. Happy 35th, buddy boy.

LARRY
Why, thanks, Clip. I honestly didn’t
think anyone remembered.

He opens the package to find a slab of rubber vomit.
LARRY -
Wow. Artificial Puke. How'd you know
what I wanted?
CLIP
That’s not just any old barf, Lare.
Take a closer look.
Larry examines the vomit closely.

LARRY

This is it? The actual stuff!? But
I thought Mr. Green confiscated it!

LARRY

God, we had fun in those days, .

didn’t we?
CLIP
Tons. Which is why I’m giving it
to you for your birthday, because
I knew what a sentimental fool you
are.
Clip moves slyly closer to Larry.

CLIP
And because...you make me sick!

Clip grabs Larry around the head and tries to kiss him.

CLIP
Now where’s my thank-you kiss?

Hey! Knock it off!

Larry struggles to get out of Clip’s headlock.

LARRY
Hi, Cindy. How are you? Boy is this
ever a coincidence! Jackie Earle
was just in here. You know, your
husband? Yeah, he sure looks good...

Cindy Jo is enjoying Larry's awkwardness.

LARRY
How’ve you been? Boy, Jackie seemed
fine...Clip and I are pretty good.
Busy, though. Yeah, workin’ all the i
time...So how’ve you been anyway? .

CINDY JO

LARRY

Well, I just wanted to make
absolutely sure...

 

CINDY JO
Do you know if Jackie went back to

LARRY
Oh yeah. I’m sure he did. Lots of
work to do, ya know. Touchdowns and
all that stuff.

CINDY JO

Nice seeing you, Larry. Bye, Clip.
Cindy Jo smiles and glides away.

Yeah, so?
LARRY
So...she smiled at me. You know,
smiled!
CLIP 4
You mean as in...exposed her-teeth?

Exactly!

Geez! I’m surprised you didn’t throw

SOMEONE down the hall.

LARRY

Yeah.

INT. CAFETERIA DAY 14

Larry and Clip are moving down the line in the CROWDED
cafeteria. Clip is loading his tray with food.

LARRY
You ever have any regrets, Clip?
You know, about the way your life
turned out? About the choices you
made?

CLIP
Nah. I figure I didn’t make ali that
many choices. My policy is to do
nothing and see what happens. And
you know what? Things always seem
to’ turn out fine!

Larry and Clip sit down at a long table. Clip begins eating
as he speaks animatedly.

CLIP
You know what your problem is?
Nothing’s ever good enough for you.
And the problem with that is you’re
never satisfied. And the problem
with that is you’re never happy.
And the problem with that is no one
wants to go bowling with ya on
Saturday night because you’re
depressed all the time. And that’s
a real problem. Right?

LARRY :
It’s not that I’m depressed. I just
wish things could be different once
in awhile.

CLIP
You gotta learn to accept things
as they are. You’ll get more bowling
outa life that way.

@ LARRY
But I feel like there’s nothing
going on in my life. Like I’m
half-dead or something.

cLIP
You got it made if you ask me. You
got a wonderful home,-a wonderful
wife, a good job and the best friend
money can buy. What else do ya want?

LARRY
A little excitement would be nice.

A lunch tray CLATTERS on the table. Ellen sits down angrily.
She is wearing a hair-cover and there is a dust shadow
around her eyes where a pair of goggles were.

ELLEN
I am so mad I could scream!

LARRY
What’s wrong, sweetheart?

Maddie and Heather just got laid

to keep up! Can’t you do anything
about this, Larry? It makes me sick
the way this company’s been treating

Okay, okay, I’11 see what I can do. b

INT. NILES PENDER’S OFFICE DAY 16
(cU) A walnut is broken open by a nutcracker with a LOUD

SNAP. CAMERA FOLLOWS as a piece of the walnut is brought

up to the mouth of NILES PENDER, 37. He begins to pace

around the office speaking in very gentle and measured tones
as he eats the walnut.

NILES
Fenwick. State the problem, please.

FENWICK
Low profits.

FOUR MANAGEMENT~TYPES are ranged on chairs around the
office, The epicene LEWIS FLICK is standing by the door.
Larry and Clip are seated on the sofa.

NILES
And the solution? Graham?

GRAHAM
Higher productivity.

NILES
What could be more simple? In order
to make more money, we have to make
more product, but not pay more ta
make it. It’s a beautiful concept.
Don’t you think so, Bennett?

BENNETT
Beautiful, sir.

NILES
Indee@d it is. Which is why, starting
tomorrow all production quotas will
be increased by 15%. And those who
fail to meet that goal...well, let’s
just say our company and their
company shall...part company.

Suddenly, Larry clears his throat.

NILES
Is that a comment I hear, Burrows,
or merely phlegm rising in your
throat?

LARRY
Just a thought here, Niles. But
don’t you think it’s a little unfair ‘
to impose higher production quotas,
considering we already have an
inventory surplus?

NILES
Really? And on what are you basing
this so-called “surplus"?

LARRY
On the fact that I counted every
single crate in the warehouse 10
days ago.

NILES
Hmmm. Then I would say we have a
problem with our mutual perceptions
of reality, for my own calculations
show a considerable shortfall.

The door opens. It’s Jackie Earle and LEO HANSEN, 63, Cindy
Jo’s father and the Chairman of The Board.

LEO
Sorry to barge in, Niles. Do Jackie
and I need to be here for anything?

Niles’ face breaks into the most obsequious smile.

NILES
Not at all, sir. Just boring
production details. I can handle
it.

My son-in-law’s going to show me
how to get rid of my slice.

NILES
Wonderful, sir.

LEO
Oh, by the by, what time’s the Board
meeting tonight?

NILES
Seven-thirty.

LEO .
Won't be a long one I hope. We have
a 9 o'clock dinner reservation...

NILES
You’ll be there in plenty of time,
sir.

LEO
Excellent. Goodbye then.

JACKIE EARLE
Touchdowns everyone.

Niles instantly drops his phoney smile.

NILES
Amazing.
(to Larry) ©
Alright, Burrows, since we seem to
have a disagreement on the
inventory, I suggest you check it
all over again.

LARRY
But that’ll take three or four days.

NILES
Well, I don’t see a problem with
that. Lewis, do you see a problem
with that?

Larry opens his mouth to speak. Then thinks better of it.

INT. WAREHOUSE DAY 47

Larry is in the warehouse, going through the inventory
check. He is mumbling angrily, saying what he wished he
could have in the previous scene.

LARRY e
Yeah, I see a problem, you dick.
What are you going to do about it,
huh? Huh?! You prissy little wimp!

As he looks down at the clipboard, the two forks of a4
forklift CROSS FRAME in front of him. He looks up to SEE:

A VERY PRETTY GIRL, JEWEL JAGGER, mid 20s, on a forklift,
spearing a crate off one of the shelves next to him.

JEWEL
Excuse me. Would you mind stepping
back? You wouldn’t want me to fork
you to death, would you?

The girl looks at him coquettishly. Larry laughs nervously.

LARRY
No, we couldn’t have that...I mean,
after all, we’ve only just met...

JEWEL
~ (very suggestively)
Since when does that matter?

Jewel smiles provocatively, then wheels away. Larry watches
her go, stunned,

MALE VOICE

Va~va-va-voom!

Larry turns to SEE his father, HARRY, a balding man in his
mid-50s standing where the crate was.

LARRY
Incredible. You know, sometimes I

out on something.

They watch Jewel wheel down the aisle.

HARRY
What she’s got, and she’s got
plenty, you don’t need.

LARRY
You sure? 4

HARRY v
Not absolutely. But if I ever tried
to find out...your mother’d kill .
me.

Larry puts his arm around Harry’s shoulder and smiles.

LARRY
@ You’re the dad every kid dreams of.

HARRY
Don’t be a wiseguy. Listen, Petey
Fleckman just got canned. That‘s
three guys since yesterday.
Somethin’ stinks around here, kiddo,
and I don’t mean the meatloaf
special in the cafeteria.

LARRY
Yeah I heard...

HARRY
Hey, hey, lookit this here.

Harry grabs Larry and points between a pile of crates.

They SEE Niles Pender leading SIX JAPANESE BUSINESS MEN
through the warehouse.

HARRY
That’s the same bunch he had down
here last week. Looks like the same
bunch anyway, who can tell?

LARRY
Okay, pop, I’1l see what I can find

HARRY

INT. OFFICE AREA DAY . » 18

LARRY’S POV: Niles’ secretary, GLADYS, 30, sitting in her
cubicle in front of his office, talking on the phone. ,

GLADYS
I’m sorry, Mr. Pender won’t be back
until 3 o’clock...Yes, thank you.

Larry is standing next to the water cooler on the far side
of the office floor, taking a slow drink as he watches her.

Gladys hangs up. She takes her purse out of her desk drawer,
gets up, and leaves the cubicle.

Still holding the paper cup, Larry starts across toward
Niles’ office.

Larry is nervous; eyes fixed on the office door. We can HEAR
his heart THUMPING LOUDLY. He’s coming closer and closer

to Niles’ door. His heart is THUMPING FASTER. Suddenly the
door opens and Lewis Flick steps out.

Larry quickly turns and veers off down the corridor. He
stops in front of another water cooler and pours himself
a drink, trying to be nonchalant.

Lewis walks past, eyeing him suspiciously.

Larry smiles casually. He upends the cup of water, then
steals a glances at Lewis, who steps into another office
down the corridor.

Larry sags against the water cooler and takes a deep breath;
then he turns toward Niles’ office again.

INT. NILES PENDER’S OFFICE DAY 19

There is a KNOCK on the door. A moment later, Larry peers
into the office. It’s empty. ~

He crosses quickly to Niles’ desk. He checks one drawer:
office supplies.

He checks another: some papers. He paws through them.
He checks a third drawer: it’s locked.

He takes a letter opener off the desk and slides it into
the lock. He twists the opener back and forth. It breaks.

LARRY
shit.
He pulls the handle hard and the drawer pulls out of the
desk. It drops on the floor, spilling papers. ‘
LARRY
Shit.

Larry bends down quickly and starts gathering up the papers.
He picks one up and reads it over, frowning.

CLOSE ON THE PAPER: It READS "Memo: Nakamura Industries
Osaka. Re: Leveraged Buy-out via Metaspo:

   

LARRY
Leveraged buy-out? What the hell
is Metasport?

Suddenly, the DOOR OPENS. He crouches behind the desk.
LARRY
(mouthing)
Shit.
FOOTSTEPS approach. Larry winces, waiting for the axe to
fall. Shoes stop in front of him. He looks up, sheepishly,
TO SEE Niles, smiling down at him wickedly.

NILES

EXT, STREET DUSK 23

Larry's car stops at an intersection. The engine RUMBLES,
BACKFIRES AND STALLS. He tries to start it again and again,
but the engine won’t turn over this time.

LARRY
(calmly)
This can’t be happening.

He sits still for a moment, then explodes in a GARBLED RAGE:
twisting and turning and beating the steering wheel. Then
just as quickly becomes composed again.

LARRY
That’s better.

He climbs out, opens the hood and peers in. ‘
LARRY .
What am I looking at this for? I
don’t know how it works.
Larry slams the hood down. He looks around. The streets are
deserted, the buildings dark. He looks up to the heavens

and SIGHS. He closes his eyes and shakes his head in
resignation.

LARRY
I give up.

When he opens his eyes, he SEES a PINK GLOW REFLECTED in
the windshield glass. He locks back and SEES:

A PINK NEON SIGN above a tavern at the end of a cul~de-sac
that READS "End Of The Road Bar".

LARRY
Thank God.

He starts walking towards the bar.

INT. “END OF THE ROAD" BAR EVENING 24
Larry enters. The place is empty except for a BARTENDER in
his early 50s, with a perpetual "Cheshire cat" grin and a
gleam in his eye. (THE THIRD INCARNATION OF MR. DESTINY. )

Over near the bar, the Bartender punches a selection into
the jukebox, then goes back behind the bar. An instrumental
version of "Someone to Watch Over Me" BEGINS TO PLAY.

He begins meticulously wiping glasses and stacking them on
the counter. Always with a knowing grin on his face.

Larry hangs up and comes over to the bar.

BARTENDER

No, I’m not alright! This kind of

MIKE
(proudly)
It is rather remarkable, if I do
say so, myself.

LARRY
I don’t understand any of this. How
could my life change this much just
because I hit a.stinking baseball?

MIKE
Well, you see, Larry, one’s destiny
is a very complicated thing. Every
single incident in a person’s life
affects everything else that
follows. One little change can spin
you off in an entirely new 4
direction. You hit the ball, became
a hero, married the prom queen, and
so on, and so on, until you find
yourself...exactly where you are!

Larry looks askance at Mike. He reaches out and pokes him
in the chest to see if he’s real.

LARRY .
What are you, an angel or something?

MIKE
Not exactly.

LARRY
Then what?

MIKE .
Have you ever been faced with a
decision, and you weren’t sure what
to do?

LARRY
Yeah, sure, plenty of times.

MIKE
But then something inside you made
you choose one direction over
another? You couldn’t explain why,
but you absolutely knew which way
to go.

LARRY
Yeah, so?

So that’s me. I make the suggestions
and you make the choices. That’s
how Destiny works, Larry. Very
subtly.

LARRY
Well if you don’t mind me saying
so, this certainly hasn’t been very
subtle so far.

MIKE
Well...there’s an old Roman saying
about that...and I should know
because I’m the old Roman who said
it. "The Fates lead him who will:
him who won’t,...they drag." i
Mike reaches out and puts a hand on Larry’s shoulder.
MIKE .
Welcome to your new life, Larry.
I hope you like it.

Mike smiles, then suddenly disappears. Larry looks around
in shock, feeling the air where Mike was.

LARRY
Hey wait a minute. What am I
supposed to do now?

Cindy Jo and the kids are waiting by the door, looking very

Larry peeks in, smiling sheepishly.

LARRY
I have a cook. I have a favorite.

He studies a family portrait on the piano.

LARRY
I have a whole new family! Good
lookin’ kids, too. Wonder what their
names are?

He looks around the magnificently decorated room. He runs
a hand over the fabric of the sofa.

LARRY
(impressed)
Nice stuff! Probably Scotchguarded

too.
He stops in front of a very BIZARRE-LOOKING PIECE OF
SCULPTURE. He frowns and leans forward, squinting. He tilts

his head to the left, then to the right. Then he bends over,
trying to make sense of it upside down.

LARRY

Suddenly, he gets the feeling he’s being watched. And he

ball, and bounces off the table onto the floor.

Boswell enters with a bottle of beer on a silver tray. He
pauses to let the cueball roll past him, then continues on.

Next to it, is a framed newspaper headline, which reads:
“BURROWS 9TH INNING HOMER EDGES FILLMORE!" There is a photo

private? There are a few points...

Lar: stops suddenly: he sees Mike on the practice green
showing AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN how to putt.

LARRY
Yeah, sure thing, Niles. Would you

guys excuse me a sec? I just wanna
practice my putting.

He grabs a driver out of his bag and starts over.

MIKE
And don’t forget the follow-through.
There’s no use playing if you don’t
plan to follow through.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks for the advice, Mike.

The Young Woman leaves as Larry comes over, excited.

LARRY
Mike! What‘re you doing here?

As they talk, Mike continues his putting.

MIKE
I‘m the club pro. For a moment or
two, anyway. Though I must say I’m
not overly fond of the attire.

LARRY
Listen, Mike, I can’t thank you
enough for what’s happened.

MIKE
I’m pretty sure the color of these
pants is unknown to nature.

LARRY
What you said was absolutely right!
Ya gotta take the bad with the good.
And in this case the good is great!

MIKE
Most people believe power is the
essential element of the game. The
hard drive off the tee. The long
irons down the fairway...

LARRY
I got tons of dough, my own company,
~ a gorgeous wife who can’t keep her
hands off me...

MIKE
But it’s finesse that’s most
important, Larry. The easy, lofting
chip shot. The gentle stroke across
the green...

Mike strokes a 35-foot putt across the green.

MIKE
Thank you, Larry.

LARRY t

Mike leans rakishly on his putter. ’
MIKE

Just taking care of business.

Then he disappears. POP! His putter stands alone, not
falling.

Larry looks around to see if anyone noticed; no one did.
Then he grabs the putter and walks away nonchalantly.
INT. CAFETERIA DAY 62

Lunchtime. The cafeteria is.CROWDED. Larry walks quickly
through, waving cheerfully.

EMPLOYEES stare at him in amazement.
Larry slaps A GUY on the back.

LARRY

Larry grabs a tray and starts through the line.

_ He looks down the line and SEES something. His eyes widen.

LARRY
Ellen! Ellen! It’s me, Larry!

Ellen turns to see Larry hurrying toward her. She backs
away, startled. Overjoyed, he wraps her in a big hug.

LARRY
I’m so glad to see you! I was
wondering where you were!

EVERYONE in line is watching. Ellen is in shock.
He holds her out at arm’s length and looks at her.

LARRY
Boy, do you ever look great! Did
you lose weight or something?

She breaks out of his grasp and straightens herself’ up.

ELLEN
I beg your pardon.

LARRY
They told me you didn’t work here-
There’s no record of an Ellen Ripley
and I knew it wouldn’t be under
Burrows.

ELLEN
Burrows? Why would it be under
Burrows? My name is Robertson.

LARRY
Robertson? What’re you doing with
that name?

ELLEN
It’s customary for a woman to take
her husband’s name, Mr. Burrows.
Now if you’ll excuse me.

She turns and walks away coldly. Larry follows her.

You‘’re married? When did that
happen?
ELLEN

She sits down at a table; Larry sits down beside her.

It suddenly

Ellen walks

LARRY
So who is this Robertson guy anyway?
What’s he look like? What’s he do

ELLEN

my private life.

LARRY
Well, yes, of course it doesn’t.
I’m just, uh, concerned...as I am
about all my employees, Miss, I mean
Mrs. Robertson.

ELLEN
Concern for your employees has never
been your strong suit, Mr.
Burrows...now if you’ll excuse me,
I’d rather eat by myself.

away, leaving Larry at the table, perplexed.

Mike sits down beside him dressed as a factory worker. He
has a tray of food.

MIKE
You really should do something about
this meatloaf, Larry. It’s
absolutely inedible.

. LARRY
What's with Ellen? Why’s she so mad
at me?

MIKE
She’s the union shop steward. The
union is upset over all the
lay-offs, the increased workloads,
the pay freezes...and I’m sure, the
meatloaf.

But I wouldn’t lay anybody off.

MIKE
But you did. And so...Ellen hates
your guts.

LARRY

Ellen hates my personal guts?

MIKE e
With a passion.

LARRY
No. I don’t believe it.

MIKE
You’ll find a lot of people don’t
like you, Larry. That’s the price
you pay for power and wealth.

LARRY
Well, what am I gonna do? I can’t
have her hating my guts all over
the place. She’s my wife, for
Chrissake!

MIKE .
Was your wife, I have to go now.
This meatloaf is making me sick.
Really, Larry, do something about
the food in this place.

LARRY
What am I going to do about Ellen?

MIKE
Whatever you do will be fine. see
you later.

Mike disappears again.

LARRY

He‘s a big help.

It suddenly occurs to him that Mike just disappeared. He
looks around quickly to see if anyone noticed.

63 INT. HALLWAY DAY
Larry is walking down a hallway, still confused and upset.
LARRY

I’m not a bad guy. I’m a nice guy!
He stops a YOUNG EMPLOYEE walking by.
LARRY
Hey kid, I’m a nice guy, right? You
like me, right?
YOUNG EMPLOYEE
(terrified)
Yes sir, I like you, sir.

LARRY i
Good. Give yourself a raise.»

He continues down the hall.
LARRY
(to himself)
I knew I was a nice guy.

Suddenly, from a doorway right in front of him, a stream
of papers comes flying out into the hall.

There is a CRY of anguish from the room. Then a HORRIBLE
ELECTRONIC WHINE and a LOUD CRASH.

Larry peers into the room to SEE:

64 INT. XEROX ROOM DAY
A MAN, his back to the door, is trying to catch the sheets
of paper spewing from a huge Xerox machine.
LARRY
Geez, I think ya busted it, pal.

LARRY
Wait’1l I tell you what happened!

Clip begins backing away.

CLIP
It was an accident, sir.

LARRY
I’m the President of Liberty
Republic! Can you believe it?

Larry keeps advancing; Clip backs around behind the Xerox
machine.

cLIP
I’m aware of that, sir. And I want
you to know that I’1ll pay for any
damages...

LARRY

Forget about that! Just come over
here so I can kiss your head!

Larry keeps advancing on him.

Clip GASPS, darts around the other side of the machine and
races out the door.

LARRY

Clip! Come back here! What’s the
matter with you?!

INT. HALLWAY DAY 65

Larry comes out of the Xerox room and calls after Clip who
is running as fast as he can down the hallway.

LARRY

Larry is sitting in the back, looking out the window, deep
in thought. Ludwig is driving.

LARRY

Can I ask you something, Ludwig?
LUDWIG

Yes, sir.
LARRY

Do you like me?

LUDWIG
Yes sir, I like you very much, sir.

In the BACKGROUND, we HEAR a CAR HORN: HONKING.

LARRY .
Are you just saying that because
I pay your salary? .

LUDWIG
No sir. I would say that even if
you didn’t pay my salary.

@ Larry nods, disbelieving.
In the BACKGROUND, the HORN HONKING GETS LOUDER.

Larry looks out the window again at a CAB DRIVER in the car
next to him.

HIS POV: The cab driver is shaking his fist at him.

CAB DRIVER
Why don’t you get outa the way! Make
some room for the rest of us!

The Cab Driver is Jackie Earle Bumpus, looking a lot less
prosperous and happy.

Larry brightens and rolls down the window.

LARRY
Jackie! It’s me, Larry Burrows!

JACKIE EARLE

A mangy dog rooting around in the garbage. Larry squints:
it’s Sammy!
Larry jumps out of the limo and starts down the alley.

LARRY
Sammy! Sammy! Here boy! Here boy!

Sammy SEES Larry approaching and GROWLS, bearing his teeth.
LARRY
Sammy! It’s me. Larry. .
Sammy continues backing away and GROWLING.
LARRY
Come on, boy. Let’s go for a ride

in the car. You can stick your head
out the window and everything.

Sammy GROWLS VICIOUSLY, then turns and runs down the alley.

LARRY
Sammy!

His call ECHOES down the alley.

INT. LARRY’S HOUSE ~~ DEN NIGHT : 67

Newspapers are spread on the floor. Larry, dressed in a
tuxedo, is sitting cross-legged surrounded by the bits and
pieces of a model car. He seems sad, lost in thought as he
examines the door-piece of the model.

CINDY JO
(from behind)
Larry! We’re going to be late! What
on earth are you doing?

He turns to SEE Cindy Jo, in an evening gown, his son in
a tuxedo and his daughter in a frilly dress.

Cindy Jo comes over to see what he’s doing.

CINDY JO
What‘s this?
LARRY
A Gull-wing Mercedes. Pretty, isn’t
it?
CINDY JO i
Yes I know, dear. You have one in
the garage.
LARRY .

That one’s too big.
He looks at the half-finished model.

LARRY
I kinda like ‘em smaller.

CINDY JO .
Are you alright? You’ve been acting
very strange lately.

LARRY
I’m fine. You guys go on without
me. Have a good time. I need to
finish this up.

Cindy Jo sighs and exits with the kids.

EXT. HOUSE NIGHT 68

Larry’s ‘54 Porsche Spyder pulls up across the street from
a small bungalow, nicely-kept, on a quiet street.

Larry, still in his tux, looks out at the house a moment.

LARRY
Nice house. Better than the one we
had.

Suddenly, the front door opens. Ellen’s husband TOM
ROBERTSON, 36, very good-looking, comes out. He starts down
the sidewalk.

Larry ducks down in his seat.
Suddenly, Robertson turns back toward bungalow.

, TOM
I just wanted to borrow some
cutlery, Ellen. I have no cutlery.
None. All I’m asking for is a couple
of lousy knives and forks!

Ellen comes to the door.
ELLEN
Why don’t you ask your girlfriend
for a knife and fork! Or does the
little bitch eat with her fingers!
Robertson tries to take on a friendlier tone.
TOM an
Come on, honey, be reasonable. I
made a mistake, and I’m very sorry
for it. Now can’t we try to put all
this behind us?
Ellen slams the door with a resounding BANG.
Robertson turns and starts down the sidewalk again.
Larry realizes what’s going on and smiles.

LARRY
This is good. This is very good.

Larry eases out of his car and sneaks across the street as
Robertson gets into his Corvette and drives off.

Larry approaches a side window of the bungalow and peers
in. He SEES Ellen pacing angrily in the living room.

ELLEN
That miserable rotten creep!

Ellen picks up a framed photo of Robertson and throws it
in the fireplace. Then she walks out of the room.

Larry chuckles gleefully.

LARRY
That’s my girl.

Suddenly, the huge face of a St. Bernard lunges out of
nowhere at the glass, BARKING LOUDLY.

With a STARTLED CRY, Larry tumbles backward into the
shrubbery.

Ellen comes back in the living room.

ELLEN
What’s the matter, Hercules? You
want out?

The dog keeps on BARKING.

ELLEN
Okay, come on.

She pulls the dog from the window.

The front door opens and the St. Bernard comes charging out,
SNARLING and BARKING. It races across the lawn and begins
sniffing the trunk of a tree.

PAN UP the trunk to find Larry sitting in the branches,
looking down and breathing heavily.

LARRY
(whispering)
Go away. Get outa here. Scram.

Suddenly, Mike appears beside Larry, startling him -

LARRY
Geezuz, don’t do that! I almost fell
outa the tree.

MIKE
This is a very strange place to be
spending the evening and you seem
a touch overdressed.

LARRY
Keep your voice down. Where in God’s
name have you been anyway?
Everything’s turned to shit! All

MIKE
Well, as I told you, you have to

LARRY
I know, I know...the bad with the
good. You’re full of cute little
sayings, aren‘’t you? I just want
my old friends to like me. Is that :
so much to ask?

MIKE
You can’t have everything, Larry.

LARRY
Again with the sayings.

MIKE
Larry, you have to understand that
people see you differently now. It
goes with your new life.

LARRY
But how come I was such a nice guy
in my old life and I became such
a prick bastard in this one?

MIKE
Even a nice guy can become unlikable
given the right set of
circumstances. Sometimes things just
happen and you don’t really have
a Choice in the matter.

LARRY
No choice, huh? Well we'll see about
that. I think it’s time to make
Some changes around here.

The St. Bernard starts BARKING at them again-

Wait a minute. What’s my name doing

Yes, LJ.
LARRY

Well, I‘m glad you’re taking this
so well.
JEWEL

I guess some things just aren‘t
meant to be, LJ.

LARRY
That’s the spirit.

He comes around the desk and kisses her on the forehead.

LARRY
I knew you’d understand.

INT. MANSION - DRESSING ROOM NIGHT 76

Larry is whistling as he gets ready for his date with Ellen;
tying his tie in the mirror.

Suddenly, Mike APPEARS in the mirror, staring back at him.

LARRY
Geezuz! Don’t do that, Mike!

MIKE
Congratulations, Larry. It’s a brave
man who takes command of his own
destiny.

LARRY
Yeah, well, thanks. I feel pretty
good about it myself.

MIKE .
And you don’t feel guilty running.
around with Ellen behind Cindy Jo’s 2
back?

LARRY
Guilty? Why should I feel guilty?
I just got here, remember? It’s not
like I have a history with Cindy
Jo or anything...I mean I hardly
even know her...

MIKE
Well, okay fine. Say, what do you
think of this tie? I found a
wonderful little shop...

LARRY
Wait a sec, wait a sec. What do you
mean..."well, okay fine"?

MIKE
Oh, nothing really. It’s just that
Cindy Jo’s been a loyal and loving
wife for the last 10 years and the
mother to a pair of adoring
children, the fruit of your personal
loins.

LARRY
What are you getting at, Mike?

MIKE
Your destiny has been changed,
Larry..-by request I might add, and
you have to respect the
circumstances of your new life. They
are of your own making, after all.

LARRY
If I made ‘em, I can unmake ‘em.

Harry Burrows storms in and Mike FADES from the mirror.

HARRY
Goddammit, kid! Lewis Flick just
told me you torpedoed the Jap deal!

LARRY ‘
You knew about that?

HARRY
Don’t play dumb with me. You brought
me in on this for a big slice. How
d’ya expect me to keep a babe like
Gina happy without a shitload of
money?

LARRY
She’s not important, Dad. Neither
is the money. I got it all worked
out. Look at this.

He hands him a telegram. Harry reads it.

HARRY
What? Your mother’s coming back?
But she told me I was a ridiculous
old lecher who should rot in hell.

Larry puts his arm around Harry’s shoulder.

LARRY
Everything’s gonna go back the way .
it was, Dad. We’ll all be together
and you can stop wearing that .
ridiculous toupee. We’ll be a family
again.

HARRY
You really think this is a good
idea?

LARRY
It’s a great idea. You’ll see.

LARRY
Oh, uh...0h, geez! Cindy! Didn’t
my secretary call you? She was
supposed to call you. It was
incredible what happened. You
wouldn't believe it if I told you.

CINDY JO
Try me.

LARRY
Well, I had to go out.

CINDY JO
What for?

LARRY

For glue! For the model car I was .
working on, remember? I ran out,

so I figured I'd go to a 7-11. Which

I dia.

fifteen minutes.

robbing the place! I couldn’t
believe it!

He stops and looks around.

LARRY
Have you seen my car keys anywhere?
CINDY JO
And?
LARRY 5

Oh...so then...after they tied up

the Iranian guy, they took me

hostage. We drove all the way to .
the Illinois border, but then they

let me go because I reminded them

it’s a federal offence to take

someone across a state line against
their will.

CINDY JO
Why didn’t you come home after that?

LARRY
I was going to come home after
that...but by then it was about
seven o’clock and I remembered I
had a breakfast meeting at eight.
So I went right to it. I told my
secretary to call you because I knew
you'd be worried. Are you sure she-
didn’t call? She was supposed to
call you. Did you check for
messages? I can’t believe it. she’s
really incompetent. That’s it, I’m
going to fire her. She’s history. .
How do I look?

CINDY JO
Larry, are you seeing another woman?

Whew. That was close.

He SEES Mike sitting in the '’54 Porsche Spyder.

LARRY
Oh no, not again.

MIKE
James Dean used to drive one of
these. I tried to talk him out of
it but he wouldn’t listen. Great
actor, though. Remember that drunk
scene in "Giant"?

LARRY ,
Listen, Mike, I know what you’re
trying to do, but I will not feel .
guilty about this.

MIKE
You can’t just run around mixing
and matching the circumstances of
your destiny in any way that suits
your whims. There are other people
involved.

LARRY

Let me do it my way, okay?
Mike eyes Larry a moment, then nods.

MIKE
Fine. You make the choices, I onl.

dropping me off downtown? I have

Mr. Burrows! If this is your attempt
to soften me up so you can get
concessions from the union...

LARRY
I don’t want any concessions.
Honest. The contracts are as good
as signed.

ELLEN
We could’ve done that at the
meeting. What’re you up to?
LARRY
Nothing. Really. I just thought we

flops forward. Exasperated, he tries to pull it off. The
entire brim lifts free, leaving only the crown. Larry looks
like a Conehead.

Ellen laughs.

Larry realizes he looks stupid, so he tries to put the brim
back on. But this time, it goes all the way down around his
neck. So he looks like a Conehead Wearing A Big Straw Bib.

Ellen laughs harder.

Now really annoyed, but trying to be cool, Larry tries, to
make his shot. He swings. But as he makes contact, the’ ball
doesn’t move but the head of the putter falls off.

Ellen sinks to her knees, laughing. . .

Ellen putts into the mouth of a large adobe “Case Grande"

Larry gets on his knees to look into the Case Grande.
Suddenly he leaps back as a RAT comes scurrying out. Larry
does a dance of terror, throwing what’s left of his
sombrero and his putter at the panicked rat.

he HEARS a THUD and a GROAN from behind some bushes.
Curious, he goes over to FIND: .

Clip splayed out on the ground. A cardboard box full of
office items is overturned on the ground.

. LARRY
Clipper? Are you alright?

CLIP
(looking up)
I fell down. I fall down alot, Mr.
Burrows. I think I tripped over
a sprinkler head. I/11 pay for it
if I broke it.

Larry helps him to his feet.

LARRY
What are you doing here so late?

CLIP
uh...I was cleaning out my desk.
LARRY
Good idea. We’ll move you into Niles
Pender’s office tomorrow. I fired
the bastard.

CLIP
You don’t understand, Mr. Burrows.
I can’t take the job you offered
me. If I do, I’11 just screw it up.

LARRY
No you won't, you’ll be great. Trust
me. I know what you’re capable of.

Clip quickly gathers up his belongings.

cLIP

Everything I touch turns to shit.
I’ll run this company right into
the toilet. So, if you don’t mind,
I’d rather not even try. I have
to go now, sir, I locked the keys
in my car and the engine’s running.
Thanks anyway, Mr. Burrows. Sorry
if I let you down, but that’s the
only thing I’m really any good at.

LARRY .
Clip. Listen to me. Go home. Get
a good night’s sleep. You'll feel .
better about this in the morning.

CLIP
Well, okay. But it’s not going to
~ do any good.
Larry watches as Clip turns and walks away.
LARRY
(to himself)
He’ll be alright.
Then we HEAR A THUD OFF-CAMERA. Larry winces.
CLIP
(9o.s.)

Another sprinkler head, sir! I/11
pay for it if I broke it.

Larry FLIPS ON THE LIGHTS and SEES Leo lying on the carpet.
He rushes across and bends down beside him.

LARRY
‘Oh God! Leo! Leo!

He feels for a pulse.

LARRY
Oh, no...Leo.

He picks up the bloody golf club and siowly rises.

Suddenly, the door bursts open. It’s Niles and THREE
HEAVILY-ARMED SECURITY GUYS.

NILES
Cover him! He’s got a weapon!

The Security Guys aim their weapons at a stunned Larry.

EXT. ADMIN BUILDING NIGHT 105

TWO DETECTIVES AND TWO COPS are leading Larry through the™
parking lot toward the police cars.

LARRY
Niles Pender is the one you should
be arresting, not me.
Suddenly, there is a LOUD POP. A CAR WINDOW SHATTERS.
There are SHOUTS as everybody drops to the ground.
There is ANOTHER POP. A TIRE EXPLODES. ANOTHER POP.
A bullet SLAMS into the car beside Larry. He looks around
wildly and SEES a drunken Jewel Jagger weaving toward hin,
aiming a large automatic pistol.
JEWEL
Think you can just toss me aside
like a used piece of kleenex, huh?
She FIRES AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.
Larry leaps to his feet and starts running.

Jewel continues SHOOTING until the gun is empty.

JEWEL
Stupid gun.

The Cops leap all over her. She SCREAMS and claws at them.

1ST DETECTIVE
Someone get Burrows!

Larry leaps into his Spyder.

Jewel yanks a Cop’s gun from its holster and starts BLASTING
at Larry again. Five times.

The Cops dive for cover again.
Larry’s Spyder races across the parking lot.
Jewel takes very careful aim. It looks like she can’t miss.
JEWEL
Suck on this, you two-timing son
of a bitch. -
She squeezes the trigger. CLICK, no bullet.

JEWEL
Shit!

Larry races away..
A second later, THE COPS peer out from behind their cover.
EWEL

Well, don’t just stand there. Go
after the bastard and shoot him!

ELLEN
Larry? What is it..?

LARRY
Something’s happened. I’ve gotta
get out of here and you’ve got to
come with me.

ELLEN
Come with you where?

LARRY
It doesn’t matter. Jamaica, Mexico,
Canada...As long as we’re together.

ELLEN
But what’s happened?

LARRY .
I‘ll explain on the way. We’ve got

to hurry!
In the distance, we HEAR POLICE SIRENS.

@ LARRY

We can start over again. Just like

it was before. And I know you think
it won’t work, but it will because

we've already done it!

ELLEN
Are you talking about that previous
life thing again, Larry?

LARRY
Yes! Exactly! We’ll have
Thanksgiving and Christmas and
birthdays and breakfast and all that
stuff, just like before. Don’t you
see? We belong together. C’mon, rail
help you pack.

Ellen is hesitant, torn but gentle.

ELLEN

Wait a minute, Larry. That all

sounds wonderful. It really does.

It’s just that...after our dinner,

I started thinking about a lot of

things... about where I am in my
e@ life...about what has real

importance to me...

Ellen’s husband Tom comes up behind her.

TOM
What’s the matter?

He puts a protective arm around an uncomfortable Ellen.
TOM 4
Hello...

ELLEN
Tom, this is my boss, Larry Burrows.
Larry, this is my husband, Tom.

Larry’s elation dissipates. He sizes up the situation in
an instant: they’ve reconciled.

LARRY
Hi Tom.

TOM
Nice to meet you Mr. Burrows...
What’s going on, Ellen?

Ellen looks down, embarrassed.

LARRY
Uh...nothing. Nothing’s going on,
Tom. I’m, uh, I have to leave town
and I just stopped by to say so
long. Well,..so long.

He starts to walk back to his car. Just as he’s about to

SIRENS CAN BE HEARD a short distance away.
LARRY

It’s all my fault. I’m so stupid,

The Police Car is gaining on hin.
Larry darts down an alley.

The Police Car pulls in after him.

EXT. ALLEYWAY NIGHT 111

Larry leaps onto a dumpster and vaults over a fence.

EXT. YARD NIGHT 112

Larry lands with a CRASH in a pile of garbage. He climbs
out, GROANING and brushing himself off. He looks up,
startled to SEE:

A BAG MAN, mid-30s, standing there, dressed in filthy
clothes. Next to him is a shopping cart, full of junk.

Larry vaults over another fence and lands in another alley.

He runs down to the end, stumbling and then collapses

against a wall, out of the breath.

He looks both ways: nothing. He looks up to the heavens;
then closes his eyes in total exhaustion.

LARRY
I give up.

A PINK GLOW magically comes up on his face.

He opens his eyes and notices the GLOW. He moves away from
the wall and peers around the corner.

TO A CELESTIAL SWELL OF MUSIC, he SEES the PINK NEON SIGN
of "The End of the Road Bar". His eyes widen and he dashes
toward it. .

LARRY : .
Oh my God! Mike!

The Police Car SCREECHES around the corner, three blocks

LARRY
Mike! Mike! Where are you?

The place is empty.
LARRY
Mike! This is no time to play games!
I need you!
But there’s no answer.
POLICE SIRENS are getting CLOSER.
Larry leaps over the bar and begins throwing ingredients
into a glass. He shakes it all up, takes a guip. Then he
spits the drink across the bar.
LARRY
That's disgusting!
The POLICE SIRENS DIE OUT with a final WHINE.

LARRY
Shit.

Larry comes out from behind the bar with his hands up.

Okay! I’m coming out! Don’t shoot!
I’m not armed!

The door opens and A MAN DRESSED IN OVERALLS peers in:

“TRUCK DRIVER .
Somebody here call for a tow-truck?

Behind the driver, we SEE a tow truck with the REVOLVING
FLASHING LIGHTS.

LARRY
Tow truck...

Suddenly the realization rushes in on him. He whirls around
to see Mike standing behind the bar, smiling.

MIKE
Don’t shoot? What’re you talking

Niles is in the middle of his report. Leo, Jackie Earle,
Lewis, and OTHER BOARD MEMBERS are listening.

NILES
As you can see, sales during the
past two quarters have been
declining and therefore I recommend
we take Mr. Nakumura’s very generous
buy-out offer of $35 a share.

LEO
Well, Niles, I must say, I find this ‘
very disturbing...what do you think,
Jackie?

JACKIE EARLE .
Well, I don’t know what to think,
Leo. This comes as quite a surprise.

LARRY
Anybody want to know what I think?

The Board turns to see Larry standing in the doorway.

LARRY
I think Niles is full of shit! This
company is in perfect financial
health.

NILES
You don’t work here anymore,
Burrows! Get out!

LARRY
Niles and Lewis have been buying
up stock through a dummy corporation
and doctoring the books to make it
seem as if the company was failing
so this board would be motivated
to sell.

LEO
Niles, what’s he talking about?

mismanagement is solely to blame
for the record loss we show in this
quarter. Lewis, call security!

Lewis reaches for a phone. Larry grabs it out of his hand.
Lewis tries to grab it back. Larry twists away and rips the
cord out of the phone.

JACKIE EARLE
Gentlemen, please! We’re all on the
same team here. There’s no need for
this kind of behavior!

NILES
Burrows is a thief and a liar! He’li
say anything to regain his position
with this company! I move that the x
entire board vote to censure him
and file criminal charges...

LARRY .
And I move you shut your face!

And with that, Larry lands a fist right in Niles’ face.
Niles drops backward in his chair, unconscious.

LARRY
Sorry, Jackie. This guy’s never been
part of the team. So I benched him.

_ LEO
Larry, is any of this true?

LARRY
I suggest you check on a certain
MetaSport Corporation af Delaware
and pay particular attention to who
its executive officers are. Yes,
Lewis?

Larry turns to Lewis, who is now sweating prefusely. He
leans down and whispers.

LARRY
