EXT. EASTWICK

The first rays of light cut through the night shadows,
chasing the darkness and revealing...

SEVERAL ANGLES - TOWN

A picture postcard New England village. Peaceful and
just a little mysterious in its stillness. As the day

begins...

is awake now.

INT. WORKROOM - WOMAN'S HANDS - DAY
VARIOUS ANGLES

as the hands shape the clay into the form of a woman.
With the help of a butter knife and some toothpicks, a
little "doll" emerges -- five or six inches long,
primitive, a littly chubby, but clearly a woman.

INT. SUKIE RIDGEMONT'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 9

Sukie's five children are getting ready for school.
Havoc reigns as they fall over each other grabbing for
clothes and slamming in and out of the bathroom. FOLLOW
BOBBY, the five year old, as he runs out of the bedroom.

ANGLE 12

A cat and her nine newborn kittens. CAMERA LEAVES Bobby
and MOVES OUT of the kitchen to discover.

EXT. SUKIE'S HOUSE - DAY 13

SUKIE RIDGEMONT is picking zucchini in her garden. In
fact, the entire garden is overrun with this single vege-
table. It looks like a jungle. And the zucchini are
huge. She carries them like logs. Finally she stops

and looks at the garden.

SUKIE
(to the zucchini)
That's it. The rest of you can
rot.

ANGLE - BOBBY AND MARY ANN AND OTHER KIDS 14

Coming out of the house carrying schoolbooks and lunch
pails. As Sukie hustles them into the car, she dumps

the zucchini into the backseat. Bobby examines one of
the sandwiches from his pail.

BOBBY
What's this?

SUKIE
Peanut butter.

BOBBY

Peanut butter and what?

SUKIE
Peanut butter and jelly.

BOBBY
What kind of jelly?

SUKIE
Zucchini jelly. It's very good.
You'll like it.

MARY ANN
We had zucchini yesterday, too.
We had zucchini all summer.

SUKIE
I know, honey. They just keep
growing. Maybe we'll get a good
frost one of these nights and
they'll all die.

They drive away.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - JANE SMART - DAY 16

is assembling the grammar school band for the opening
day assembly.

JANE
We can have one quick run
through if we hurry. Don't
drag the tuba, Martha.

ANGLE - PRINCIPAL 17

of the school, RAYMOND NEFF, approaches her from behind.
He has a bit of a lecherous look in his eyes. He stands
uncomfortably close to Jane.

RAYMOND
How are we doing?

JANE
Fine, Raymond. We're doing
just fine.

RAYMOND
I wish we could afford to keep
you here full time.

JANE
I wish you could, too, Raymond. I
could use the money. Especially now.

RAYMOND
Yes. Is the divorce final yet?

JANE
Finished. Yeah. Today. I'ma
free woman. I could really use
the job.

RAYMOND
Well, let's put our heads together.
Maybe we can work something out.
Hmm?

Very discreetly, he pats her on the behind and moves off.
Jane gives him a look.

INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DAY 18

ALEXANDRA SPOFFORD is carrying two trays filled with the
little clay dolls to her kiln which is next to her stove.
She puts the trays into the kiln and checks the tempera-
ture. (Like the houses of Jane and Sukie, Alex's house
was once nice but now suffers from Alex's economic condi-
tion which is close to poverty level.) Alex's twelve-
year-old daughter, CAROL, is at the table eating her
breakfast and reading a book. She is shy, introverted
and slightly overweight.

CAROL
Are you coming today?

Alex hurries to iron a blouse and a skirt, make coffee
and toast and pack Carol's lunch -- all at the same time.

ALEX
I'll be there. I just need to
clean up and change. Answer the
phone, will you, honey?
The phone is not ringing. Nonetheless, Carol goes to
the phone -- still reading her book -- and puts her hand
over the receiver. The PHONE RINGS. She picks it up.

CAROL
Hello?

(CONTINUED )
18 CONTINUED: 18

ALEX
Tell her I'm busy and can I
call her back.

CAROL
(into phone)
She said she's busy and can she
call you back. Okay.

Carol hangs up the phone and returns to the table.

ALEX
Here's your lunch.

No response from Carol. Alex sits down at the table
with her.

ALEX
(continuing)
What's the matter? Hmn?

CAROL
Are you going to get married again?

ALEX
Well, gee, I don't know. I haven't
thought about it. Why?

CAROL
Nothing.

ALEX
Were you thinking about Daddy?

No answer from Carol.
ALEX
(continuing)
Yeah. I miss him, too.
The school bus HONKS its HORN.
ALEX
(continuing)
You better get a move on.
Carol grabs her things and starts to go. Alex stops her.
ALEX
(continuing)
You're the prettiest kid I ever
had.

She kisses her. Carol goes.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - ANGLE - FELICIA GABRIAL - DAY 19

is singing "America, the Beautiful."

ANGLE - JANE 20

leading the band as they try bravely to play the music.
They hit some real clinkers, but Felicia sings on un-

daunted -- and quite beautifully.
ANGLE - SCENE 21
Students, faculty and parents -- mostly mothers -- listen-

ing. Carol, Bobby, Mary Ann and the rest of Sukie's
children are among the students. The band comes to a
startling finish. Everyone applauds. Felicia bows.
Then she shakes hands with Jane. Jane mimes an apology
and returns to her seat. She is exhausted by the ex-
perience. Felicia is unphased by the playing of the
band. She sits down happily.

RAYMOND NEFF 22
comes forward and addresses the assembly.

RAYMOND
Well, wonderful. Thank you,
Felicia. Thank you, children.
And thank you, Miss Smart. I
can see we all have our work
cut out for us...

Jane winces. Some laughter comes from the audience.
Raymond winks at Jane. Jane looks at him with disdain.

RAYMOND

(continuing)
But seriously, welcome. As
we begin another year at Lenox
Elementary, my thoughts turn --
as indeed they must -- to the
great family who founded the
town of Eastwick -- the Lenox
family. And especially Major
Ronald Northrup Lenox in whose
name our school was consecrated...

Listening to the principal with growing annoyance and
boredom. She looks out over the audience.

in agreement with Jane's thoughts. Then she looks over
her shoulder at...

SUKIE'S POV - ALEX
exchanges a look with Sukie. The three women seem to be
reading each other's thoughts. Alex turns to look at...

ALEX'S POV - JANE

Who is smiling at Alex.

ANGLE - PRINCIPAL
Who has been speaking over the above...

RAYMOND

In these days of disintegrating
values and lost mores, when our
children are exposed daily to the
hazards of divorce and separation
and families torn asunder, it is
comforting to think back to the
days...

ANGLE - FELICIA

Who is smiling but having trouble keeping her eyes open.

ANGLE - JANE

Who gazes toward the heavens. She closes her eyes and
seems to be saying something to herself.

ANGLE - SKY

There aren't many clouds in the sky. But the few that
are there begin to move and grow in size.

ANGLE - PRINCIPAL

RAYMOND
... When a family like the Lenox
family strove together to subdue
the Indians and the thousand
catastrophies of the wilderness
to establish our little village...

Eastwick would never have

THUNDER rolls in the sky.

She closes her hand over the drop and looks at...

The values of that time embodied

in a man like Major Lenox...

A sudden CRACK of LIGHTNING and the rain starts to fall

laughter as the rain hits them.

ALEX
At least it shut Raymond up.

JANE
Really, the same boring speech...

SUKIE
I was praying for it. I thought,
God, he's going to go on forever...

ALEX
I know. I was thinking the same
thing.

JANE

I was thinking he was all wet and
wouldn't it be nice if we could
get out of there.

ALEX
Were you really?

SUKIE
And then it rained.

JANE
I know.

SUKIE

That's amazing.

ALEX
Well, it couldn't have happened
to a nicer guy. How about a
drink?
CUT TO:

SUKIE'S KITCHEN - CLOSE ON LARGE MARTINI PITCHER 49

Vodka is being poured into the pitcher. And then a
splash of vermouth is added. (There is a hint of ritual
in the mixing of these drinks -- as there often is when
a martini is made.)

SUKIE
He made a pass at me last week, too.

Lightning brightens the room for a moment and then
THUNDER rolls.

JANE
What do you think? Do you think
they still...
SUKIE
Yes.
JANE
Really?
ALEX

I don't believe it.

SUKIE
It's true. Once a week. Honest.
He told me. He said she has to
have it once a week or she starts
throwing things.

JANE
How could she stand it? He's like
saurkraut in heat.

The ritual continues during the above as Jane drops the
three olives into the three glasses and Alex pours the

martinis.
ALEX
Well, at least she's getting
something once a week.
JANE
Yeah. Heartburn.
ALEX
I mean it. Even Raymond Neff is
beginning to look good to me.
SUKIE
I know what you mean. Cheers.
They toast.
JANE
Cheers.
ALEX
(to Jane)
And congratulations.
SUKIE
That's right. I forgot.
JANE
Yeah. Today.
ALEX

Free at last, free at last.

SUKIE
Join the club.

They laugh and drink. A bolt of lightning seems to pass
through the room. They jump and laugh even harder. Then
Jane starts to cry. The other two embrace her.

JANE
I'm going to start all over again.
I've been doing this all day.

SUKIE
Don't. Come on.

(CONTINUED )

53 CONTINUED: (2) 53

JANE
I know. I know.

ALEX
You're going to be okay. You know?
It's a beginning. Not an ending.

JANE
Yeah. That's what they all say.

54 INT. SUKIE'S LIVING ROOM - THREE WOMEN - NIGHT (LATER) 54
The women are very relaxed and a little drunk.

SUKIE
I don't know. I still feel like
I'm being unfaithful. Even if I
just think about it.

ALEX
It's been over a year since Monty
left.

SUKIE
I know.

ALEX

And he deserted you. He left
you with five kids.

JANE
It's still hard, though. Even with
the divorce, now. I keep telling
myself, okay, it's time to start
over again. But it's not so easy.

ALEX
Well, we're a little young yet
to just throw away the key. It's
not natural. And I don't mean
just sex. I mean, what are we
doing with ourselves? I loved
Ozzie, but I don't think he'd
want me to be in mourning for
the rest of my life, having
drinks with the girls every
Thursday night. What kind of
life is that?

JANE
But I like our Thursday nights.
It's one of the few chances we
get to just, you know, relax.

(CONTINUED )

14.
54
ALEX

Yeah, but sometimes I think
we're hiding.

SUKIE
What from?

JANE
Raymond Neff.

ALEX

Okay, but it doesn't have to
be Raymond Neff.

JANE
Well, who?

SUKIE
Somebody nice. Somebody you could
like. God, it's like being a
virgin all over again.

ALEX
Somebody you could talk to.
Somebody with a brain.

JANE
Somebody you could be yourself
with. That would be a relief.

SUKIE
I think it would have to be
somebody from out of town.

JANE
Definitely. Especially
considering what's in town.

SUKIE
A stranger. That would be
interesting.

JANE

Yeah. Romantic. Foreign. A
tall dark European, traveling
under a curse.

ALEX
In Eastwick?

JANE
Why not? A foreign prince,
riding a great black horse.

JANE
No. Small. Really, I prefer small.
Aesthetically. And huge can be a
problem. Sam was huge and there
were days I just couldn't face it.

ALEX
I'm sort of in the middle. But
honestly, what's the difference,
as long as it works...

cut TO:

EXT. LENOX HOUSE - NIGHT 61

The Mercedes is still now. A chauffeur gets out and
carrying an umbrella, moves around the car to open the
back door. A man gets out. But both the man and the
chauffeur are concealed by the umbrella as they move
toward the house.

INT. SUKIE'S LIVING ROOM 62
SUKIE

Well, wishing for it is not going
to make it happen, is it?

JANE
No. I guess not.
ALEX
Anyway... I don't think men are

really the answer to everything.
JANE

They may not be the answer...

but they are the question.

They lift their glasses to toast.

Sitting upright in bed screaming. CLYDE fumbles --
surprised and half asleep -- and switches on a light.
FELICIA's scream comes to an abrupt end.

CLYDE
Felicia!?!

FELICIA
(very calm and totally
unaware of the fact
that she just screamed)
Hmn? What is it, Clyde?

CLYDE
Are you all right? What's the
Matter? What? Are you okay?

FELICIA
Yes. I'm fine.
CLYDE
You were yelling.
FELICIA

You must have been dreaming. Go
to sleep, for God's sake. It's late.

She rolls over and goes to sleep. Clyde is wide awake
now and totally confused.

SUKIE
I said, some man has bought the
Lenox mansion. Alex? Did you
hear me that time?

INT. ALEX'S WORKROOM - ALEX - DAY 70

is handpainting a series of little pottery dolls.
Sukie's news has triggered something in her.

ALEX
I guess I heard you the first
time. Who is he?

CUTTING BACK AND FORTH:

SUKIE
From New York. No wife or family.
He told the people at Pearly
Realty he needed all that room
for his pianos. Apparently, he
has a lot of pianos.

ALEX
How many pianos can a man have?

SUKIE
I don't know. Do you think it's
funny? I mean, strange? I mean
«.. you know.

ALEX
What's his name?

SUKIE
That's funny, too. They told me
his name, for the column, you
know. And I forgot it.

SUKIE (CONT'D)
So I called them back and they
told me again and it's gone right
out of my head again. It's not
like me to forget a name like that.
Anyway, it's the big news of the
day, considering the history of
the place... I wonder if he knows.

As she speaks, Sukie looks at...

Yes. You're very sharp today.
She just walked in.

ALEX

Lunch with Clyde.

SUKIE

Right again. Listen, I have to

run. I'll see you tonight.
ALEX (V.O.)

Yeah. I have to get to the shop.

See you later.

SUKIE
‘Bye.

She hangs up the phone and starts gathering her things.

74 ANGLE - FELICIA AND CLYDE 74

Leaving for lunch. Dressed in very conservative clothes,
they look a perfect little dull couple.

FELICIA
That house is a landmark building.
They had no right to sell it.

CLYDE
I can't do anything about that.

FELICIA
No. You're too busy reporting the
last minutes of the horse trough
committee and Herbie Prescott's
latest trip to Bermuda. And
what's going to happen to those
birds, now? Tell me that.

CLYDE
What birds?

FELICIA
The snowy egrets! Where are they
going to nest?

CLYDE
How the hell should I know?

FELICIA
Exactly. Exactly!

CLYDE
Felicia, what the hell has gotten
into you? Honey, it's only a
house. Why has this upset you
like this?

FELICIA

(calms down)
I have this feeling, Clyde. I
have the most terrible feeling.
Something... Something crawling
inside me. Something evil. Only
it's more than a feeling.
Something is happening, Clyde.

Clyde tries to take her hand. Felicia pushes him away
and keeps walking.

FELICIA
(continuing)
Don't do that. Don't touch me
like that, you silly prick. I'm
not a crazy person. And I want
to know what you're going to do

BIDDLE, the owner of the shop. She is in her eighties.

INT. SHOP - MRS. BIDDLE AND ALEX 77

are taking the dolls from the box and putting them on a
display shelf.

ALEX
Well, I'm glad they're selling.

MRS. BIDDLE
Yes. But they're not actually
‘selling.' They sold. Just like
that.

ALEX
I don't get it.

MRS. BIDDLE
Well, darling, you know how I
adore the little creatures. So
fine. So unreal and yet, the
detail... little fingers and
little toes and little pudenda
making a bump in their dresses.
So sweet. But honestly, nobody's
even looked at them sideways for
months. And then this morning,
from absolutely nowhere, this man
appeared. So charming. Not
really handsome but... riveting.
Yes. That's the word, I was
riveted. I was looking into his
eyes and I found myself thinking
thoughts I hadn't entertained
since World War II. I think I
actually blushed. Can you imagine?

ALEX
No. Well, yes. I mean... so what
happened? He bought one.

MRS. BIDDLE
He bought all of them. Every
single one. How about that?

MRS. BIDDLE
No. He just bought the Lenox
House. He's moving in.

ALEX
You don't by any chance remember
his name, do you?

MRS. BIDDLE
Yes. Of course. His name is...
He told me. I wrote it down. It
was... foreign. No. But it
sounded... It's right on the tip
of my tongue and I can't ...
Well, isn't that diabolical?

INT. CHURCH MEETING HALL - JANE - NIGHT 78

is on the small stage of the little hall. She is playing
the cello. PULL BACK to include the other three members
of a string quartet. None of them play with the skill

of Jane; but they are not bad.

ANGLE - ALEX AND SUKIE 79

Seated in an audience of about one hundred people on
folding chairs. Like the other members of the audience,
they are listening attentively. And then a sound. Like
HEAVY BREATHING. Almost inaudible at first. And then
SLIGHTLY LOUDER. Alex notices it first. She tries to
ignore it. She concentrates on the music.

ANGLE - JANE 80

Playing hard into the climax of the piece. The sound
again. A long RUMBLE of a BREATH. Like a death rattle.
Or a growl of a sleeping animal. Jane doesn't seem to
hear it.

loud.

ANGLE - ALEX AND SUKIE 82

Who jump slightly in their seats as the sound SPURTS
LOUDLY for a second and then settles back to the strange,
adenoidal RUMBLING. It doesn't sound human. Alex cranes
her head in the direction of the menacing sound.

HER POV - AUDIENCE 83

As CAMERA PANS DOWN the rows of people. The sound gets
LOUDER as we approach the source -- more sinister, more
phlegmatic and sort of disgusting, too. Heads are turn-
ing as we PASS them and finally ARRIVE AT the comic sight
of...

ANGLE - DARYL VAN HORNE 84
Asleep in his chair, his head lolling on his shoulder,

his mouth open, drooling, and emitting the strangest and
most sickening sound of snoring possible. Contrary to

our expectations, he looks like a harmless sort of guy

-- ordinary, disheveled, and, at first sight, not
particularly handsome.

ANGLE - STAGE 85

Where the quartet finishes the piece they are playing.

ANGLE - AUDIENCE 86

Bursting into applause and coming to their feet.

ANGLE - DARYL 87

Startled by the applause. He wakes, tries to sit up,
slips off his chair, and falls to the floor with a great
clatter and bang of folding chairs.

ANGLE - QUARTET 88
Bowing to the audience. Above the applause, the sound of

one person shouting, "Brava!" Jane looks in the direction
of the sound.

SUKIE
Well, the paper called him and
asked to interview him, you know,
about the house and all the
renovations, and he said he'd be
happy to do an interview. And

wants me to do the interview.

Yeah, but who is he?

Yeah. But he has some kind of

bouquet of flowers and looking radiant. Raymond Neff

Aren't they sweet?

SUKIE
Oh, look.

JANE
Yeah. And the nicest note.

Sukie takes the note and reads it. Alex starts fiddling
nervously with a string of pearls she's wearing.

ALEX
Any name?

SUKIE
No.

JANE
Just an initial. D. Just the
letter 'd.'

SUKIE
Yes, that's it. D. Uh, David...
Daniel... Dick... No... Daryl!

That's it. Daryl!

As she says the name, Alex's pearls break and fall to
the floor.

FELICIA

Daryl...
But before she can finish the name, she slips on the
pearls and starts to fall down the stairs.

ALEX

Well...
DARYL

Too bad. You haven't seen any
snowy egrets out here, have you?

ALEX
Not that I know of.

DARYL
Me, either. I'm trying to put a
tennis court in and this woman,
Felicia Gabriel, she sent me this
letter, telling me I can't fill in
the wetlands because the snowy
egrets like to nest there.

ALEX
That's what they say.

DARYL
Well, I haven't seen any.
‘Course, I wouldn't know a snowy
egret if I was pissing on one. Do
you want some lunch?

ALEX

It's the wrong time of the year.
DARYL

For lunch?
ALEX

For the birds.

He turns and starts to walk away toward the house as he
talks. Alex is not sure what to do. Then she decides
to follow him.

DARYL

..-.- Gown there. Runs a gallery.
Nice relaxed, terrific guy. Wanted

cheek. Daryl pours more wine. Fidel goes.

DARYL
Interesting, huh?

ALEX
What? Oh...

DARYL

Fidel. That's his name. Been
with me forever. I don't know
where the scar comes from. Women

How about you?

ALEX
I beg your pardon?

DARYL
You see, women are in touch with
different things. That's my
opinion. I know that's not a
fashionable opinion right now,
but fuck it, I know what I see.
I see men running around, dipping
their dicks into every little
thing, trying to make things
happen. But it's women who have
the real power, isn't it? Women
are the source, the only power.
Nature. Birth. Re-birth. Cliche,
cliche. Sure. But true.

ALEX
Why are you telling me all this?

DARYL
Because you're an honest woman.
And I'm being honest with you. I
like women. I respect them. If
you want me to talk to you like
you're a dumb twit, I will. But
what's the point? You have brains,
Alex. More than brains. You have
power. And you don't even know
it, do you? Well, most women
don't.

ALEX
Were you ever married?

DARYL
Good question. You see? Brains.
The answer is no. Don't believe in
it. Good for the man. Lousy for
the woman. She suffocates. She
dies. I've seen it. And then the
husband runs around complaining
that he's fucking a dead person.
And he's the one that killed her.
Where's your husband?

husband unloads a woman -- however
it happens -- death, desertion,
divorce -- the three 'd's' --
when it happens, a woman blossoms.
Blooms. Like flowers. Like
fruit. She is ripe. Talk about

moving through the cavernous rooms of the house. They
are sparsely furnished. Some are empty. Some have
painters working. A carpenter seems to appear from
nowhere and then disappear. Daryl babbles on, giving
Alex a tour of his belongings. CAMERA INCLUDES every-
thing he mentions, but is always MOVING, producing a
DIZZY EFFECT like the effect Daryl is having on Alex.
Occassionally she responds with some polite noise. But
she is disconnected, as if falling under a spell.

DARYL

the pianos, used to be a ballroom
-- nice word, ballroom -- nothing
to see right now, equipment, crates
... Over there, the study, have to
unpack my books, some of the old

modern furniture, some Oriental rugs, stacks of paint-
ings, leaning against the walls and several pieces of
modern sculpture.

ANGLE - PIECE OF SCULPTURE 118

A naked woman lying on her back, knees bent, legs spread,
concocted of chicken wire, flattened beer cans, an old
porcelain chamber pot for her belly, pieces of chrome,
car bumper, items of underwear stiffened with lacquer
and glue. Her face is that of a plaster doll, China-
blue eyes and pink-painted cheeks, cut off and fixed to
a block of wood.

DARYL
... This is the kind of thing you
should be doing. The richness,
the ambiguity, the humor. No
offense, honey, but you're wasting
what I think is a very big talent
on those little poppets of yours...

INT. BEDROOM - ALEX AND DARYL 119

coming into the room. Everything is black -- walls,
floor, ceiling, furnishings, curtains, carpets, sheets
on the bed, even a black clock with black hands and
numbers that are virtually impossible to read. As Daryl
speaks, Fidel enters the room. He is carrying a black
silk bathrobe. Unself-consciously, Daryl slips out of
his clothing and into the robe -- with Fidel's assis-
tance. Alex stands watching all this...

DARYL

..-. The sheets are black, too.
Hard to find. What they call
black is really navy blue. These
are black. And the lacquer work,
only two people in New York do
this kind of work. ‘Course, you
pay with your soul, but, hell...

Fidel turns down the bed and Daryl gets into it. Fidel
draws the curtains against the light and then silently
leaves the room, closing the door behind him.

I'm being as direct as I know how.
I thought you'd appreciate that.
And anyway, I always like a little
knookie after lunch. What do you say?

as trivial as seduction. But I
would love to fuck you.

ALEX
I do appreciate your directness,
Daryl. And I will try to be
direct and honest with you, too.
I think... no, I know. I am
absolutely sure that you are the
most unattractive man I have ever
met. You are vulgar, stupid,
insensitive, selfish, egotistical,
you have no taste, a lousy sense
of humor and you smell. You are
physically repulsive, intellectually
retarded, and morally reprehensible.
In the short time that we have been
together, you have demonstrated
every loathsome characteristic of
the male personality and even
discovered a few new ones. You are
a creep. A jerk. You are not

Daryl's tone changes. Suddenly he is calm, quiet,
direct and very gentle. And painfully accurate.

DARYL
What is it you have to go home
to, Alex? There's nobody there.
Is there? What'll you do? Wait
for the kid to come home? Make
some coffee? Do a little house
cleaning? Pop a few more dolls
in the oven? What's the point?

Pretending to be half of what you

you feed it, but it doesn't feed
you anymore. Does it? It washes
through you, wasted, down the
drain. A woman is a hole, isn't
that what they say? All the
futility of the world pouring into
her. How much can you take, Alex?
How much before you snap?

Alex is dizzy. The truth of what he's saying is hurting.

Lying on a bed, staring at the
ceiling, waiting for something

No respect, no fear, no love.
We are destroying ourselves.

Hocus pocus. Do you know that the

They were trying to get the
childbirth business out of the
hands of the midwives. Most of
the women who were burned, that's
what they were. Midwives.

JANE
Is that true?

DARYL
Trust me. It's just another example
of masculine supremacy. An effort
-- successful as it turned out --
to suppress the natural power of
women. And make a profit off them
at the same time. Using women for
their own selfish purposes. Men

DARYL
(seductive again)
Let it go. Let it fly. What are
you afraid of? You have great
passion in you. Let it out. I
can take it. I want it.

He puts the cello in her trembling hands. They start

to play.

Daryl coaches her.

your time. Let it wash over you.
Let it tickle you. Play with it.
Tease it. Feel it. All of it.
Taste it. Hmn. Yes. That's
good. Oh, yeah. Feel how it
wants you. It wants to surround
you. It wants to get inside you.
No. Don't tighten up. You can
handle it. There. There. There
it is. Oh, yes. Can you feel it?

Jane is moving into a state of sexual ecstasy.
DARYL
(continuing)
You've got it now. Take it.
Bear down. Ride it. Do it, Jane.
Do it!

The music soars. Jane is trembling with passion.

are actually beginning to smoke as Jane's bow rips across
them.

DARYL
Yes... Yes... Yes... Do it!

ANGLE - TWO OF THEM 144
As the music finally ends. Silence except for Jane's

heavy breathing. They look at each other. Jane lets

the cello slide to the floor. It bursts into flames.

Jane pays no attention to it. She gets up. She walks
unsteadily to Daryl. And then she falls into his arms.

Alex is working with hammer and chisel on a great ten
foot piece of stone that sits in the middle of the back-

helmut, goggles, cover-alls, tool belt, boots, etc.

SUKIE (0.S.)
Alex? Yoo-hoo!
ALEX
I'm out here.

Coming out the back door of the house with the kids.
Alex brushes herself off and picks up a tennis racket.

SUKIE
What in the world...?

ALEX
Come on, we're going to be late.

two days. Seriously. He hurts.
He has the most peculiar penis.
It bends the wrong way.
SUKIE
Okay, okay. But just because
you went to bed with him...
ALEX
No. It's more than that. He
knows me. He knows who I am.
I can't explain it. That's why
I want you to meet him. I want
Jane to meet him, too. She's

The sound of a CAR HORN statles her. She gets up and
removes her sunglasses and we see that the woman is,
in fact, Jane.

ANGLE - SUKIE AND ALEX 152

Getting out of the car and walking toward Jane.

ANGLE - SCENE 153

Jane and Alex are equally shocked and surprised to see
each other.

SUKIE
Jane...? Is that you?

JANE
Yes. Hello, Alex. Did you come
to fix the plumbing?

ALEX
I didn't have time to change.
What's your excuse?

JANE
No excuse. I was invited here.
ALEX
So was I.

DARYL
There you are! Hello. Hello.

DARYL
(to Sukie)
At last we meet.

SUKIE
Hi. Hello. How are you?

DARYL
Let me look into those eyes.
Oh, yes. What a fertile little
creature you are.

SUKIE
Well, thanks... I guess.

Alex and Jane are taken aback by Daryl's behavior. He
is totally ignoring them.

DARYL
I've been reading your work in
that rag of a newspaper. You
are a genius. Wasted. Pearls
before swine. When are we going
to do that little interview? I
love interviews. So intimate.

SUKIE
Whenever you say.

DARYL
Head to head. The two of us.
Banging away. Yes. Yes. But
not today. Today is for tennis.

He leads Sukie toward the tennis court. As he passes
Alex and Jane...

DARYL
(continuing)
Are you girls ready?

No answer. Daryl walks on with his arm around Sukie's
shoulder.

DARYL

Oh, what a day! What a day!
Smell that air...

ALEX
(loudly)
Fault!

JANE
I'm not blind. And I'm not deaf.
So there's no need to shout.

DARYL
(keeping things
light)
Second serve. Here we go.

Jane does a very peculiar wind-up for her second serve.
Alex giggles. Jane hears the giggle and stops in mid-
serve. The ball touches her racket and plops to the
ground.

JANE
What's so funny?

ALEX
Double fault!

DARYL
Okay, okay.
ANGLE - JANE 159
Serving now to Sukie.
ANGLE - BALL IN PLAY 160

Sukie returns the serve to Daryl. Daryl, who is at
net, hits the ball to Alex. Alex, rushing the net,
slams it back to Jane. Jane smashes a return to
Sukie, hitting her in the head. Sukie staggers and
recovers.

SUKIE
All right, Jane, that's enough.
JANE
15-40.
ANGLE - JANE 161

Jane bounces the ball in front of her, winding up in
preparation for a "killer" serve to Alex. The wind
kicks up, blowing up Jane's tennis skirt as well as the
net. Jane waits for the wind to die. Prepares for
another serve and once again the wind blows up her skirt
and the net. Jane stares daggers at Alex. The moment
the wind dies, without any preparation or ball bouncing,
Jane whips into a vicious serve.

ANGLE - ALEX 162

Alex caught off guard, merely tries to protect herself
from the serve as the ball meets her racket and returns
the ball to Daryl.

lobs high into the sky.
ANGLE - JANE 165
Waiting and waiting for the ball to return. Jane moves
in preparing a devastating smash. But the ball seems to
freeze in midair high above her.

JANE
It's not coming down.

Mildly astonished.

Looking up.
ALEX
Where is it?

The ball drops on her head.

JANE
There it is.

ALEX
Our game. My serve.

JANE

Jane hits the ball to Alex. Alex catches it and then
squeals. She looks into her hand and finds instead of
a ball, green slime. She drops it... the ball falls

she can serve to Jane.

hits the ball as hard as she can to Alex.

ANGLE - BALL 172

charges into a bullet as it speeds toward Alex.

ANGLE - ALEX 173

The "bullet ball" shoots right through Alex's racket,
breaking the strings. We see Alex's racket as she looks
at the ball bounce away. Alex is furious. She throws
her racket into the grass at the side of the court.

ALEX
Damn you, Jane!

JANE
Oh, damn yourself! It's not my
fault.

SUKIE

Damn both of you! Now are we
going to play or not!

DARYL
Here, I have another racket.

He goes to the side of the court to fetch a new racket

and sees...

trembles and seems to change shape as the argument
progresses.

Daryl is amazed and delighted by what he sees.

DARYL
Hell hath no fury like you three.

Jane reacts.

JANE
That's it, I quit.
ALEX
You stupid... What do you think
you're doing?
JANE
I'm going home.
SUKIE
Come on, Alex.
ALEX

No. That's enough. I'm leaving.

SUKIE
All right then, so am I.

ALEX
Where's my racket?

She gives Daryl the borrowed racket and reaches toward
the grass for the racket she threw away earlier. She
screams.

ANGLE - HUGE SNAKE 176

darts out of the grass toward Alex and the other two
women.

ANGLE - WOMEN 177

move together protectively -- for the moment forgetting
their anger with each other. Sudden THUNDER and
lightning. The SNAKE HISSES and makes a move toward
them. They scream, jump and start to laugh. Scary as
it is, they can't help laughing. The snake circles them,
driving them closer together until it is practically
touching their toes.

178 ANGLE - DARYL 178
Who raises his arms to the THUNDERING HEAVENS and yells
gleefully...

DARYL
Maleficio!
JANE
Daryl. Do something!
DARYL
Okay. Had enough?
WOMEN
Yes.
DARYL
No more fighting, no more petty
jealousy -- are we all friends
again?
ALEX

Daryl, come on.

DARYL
One for all, all for one. You
show me yours. I'1l show you
mine. For better and for worse
-- what do you say? Do we have

a deal?
WOMEN
Yes. All right. Yes.
DARYL
Till death do us part?
WOMEN
Yes!
DARYL
Okay.

Daryl snaps his fingers. A bolt of lightning screams
out of the sky and hits the ground near the snake. But
the snake is fine -- just more angry. The women are
terrified. Daryl is annoyed.

DARYL
(continuing)
Damn it.

He snaps his finger again. A second and third bolt of
lightning both miss the snake.

I am worn out. How about a bath?

Oh, this is heaven.

I should warn you, I get pregnant.
I get pregnant all the time. At

your toothbrush and get pregnant.

DARYL
I'll keep it in mind.

SUKIE
Just so you know.

DARYL
I'd love to be a woman.

JANE
You would? Why?

DARYL
Just think what you can do, I
mean, with your bodies. You can
make babies and then make milk to
feed the babies. If I could do
that...

ALEX
Then you wouldn't need us at all.

DARYL
That's true. I never thought of
that. More music.

Daryl grabs an egg beater and starts churning the water

women, driving the egg beater under the water. The women
laugh harder and push his head under the water -- various
shenanigans which become sexual. Just as Daryl is about
to make a real move, the PHONE RINGS. Daryl answers.

DARYL
Hello? Uh, yes. Yeah. Justa
minute.

Sukie)
It's for you.

I'm just not here anymore.

SUKIE
It's the pain that scares me. I
don't mind that it's a short life.
And I don't mind disappearing.
But why does there have to be so
much pain?

Well, we don't deal the deck down

Well, it feels very funny. It does.

My ears feel funny.

ALEX
Your ears are funny.

More laughter -- playful, giddy, affectionate. Slowly,
as their laughter increases, the blanket levitates --
literally floats up a few inches off the ground, carrying
the women up with it. The women are unaware of what is
happening. Daryl is amazed. He grabs his video camera
and photographs the phenomenon.

SUKIE
They aren't funny. It's just one
is higher than the other. That's

Ever since your father died, I

for you, Carol. I want you to
have everything you want and I
want you to be happy. I want to
give you everything you need. And
most of all I want to give you the
truth. But I can't give you the
truth unless I know it first. And
that's what I'm doing now. I am
looking for the truth. About
myself and about lots of other
things, too. No matter what you
hear, no matter what your friends
say about me -- that's what I'm
doing. I am looking for the
truth. Okay?

CAROL
Yeah. But what's a dyke?

ALEX
A dyke is a wall they build to
prevent floods. In Holland. It's

I love him in a way, I guess. For

No, he did fill in the wetlands

alter the landmark building. And
the town is filing a suit for two
million dollars. It's all true.

SUKIE
What about me, Clyde? I need this

And I'm improving, too. I started
a novel. Really. I'd love you
to take a look at it...

And I don't own this newspaper,

CLYDE
She's a sick woman, Sukie. She's
having a bad time. I don't know

what to do. I want her to see a
doctor. Not a doctor, but, you
know, a ‘doctor.' But I'm afraid
they might put her away. We went

Felicia seems to growl and then spews forth a great foun-

Let's just call it a day.

And then, sort of haphazardly, as if he were just putting
her back in her chair, he raises the poker and brings it
down on her head. Felicia staggers back and does indeed
sit back down in her chair. In fact, she is dead. Clyde

Sukie is in the doorway as her kids run off to meet the
school bus. Sukie waves, then she sees...

HER POV - DARYL'S MERCEDES 272
Parked across the road. Fidel gets out and approaches

the house. He is carrying a basket of fruit.

ANGLE - SUKIE AND FIDEL 273
As Fidel hands her a basket of fruit.

SUKIE
What's this, Fidel?

Fidel pushes the basket into her hands.
SUKIE
(continuing)
I can't accept this...
Fidel gives her a card. She reads it. She smiles.
SUKIE
(continuing)
.-. How is he!
Fidel answers with a look that says, "Not too good."
SUKIE
(continuing)
Tell him, I miss him, too. But
the answer is no. No.
Fidel goes. Sukie takes the basket of fruit and goes
inside.

INT. LENOX HOUSE - VIDEO SCREENS - NIGHT 274

A replay of various happy scenes of Daryl and the women.

ANGLE - SCREENS 277

As a replay of the previous beach scene comes ON and
we see Alex saying...

ALEX
(on video)
Getting old. Getting fat. That
scares me. I mean, it's a short
life, isn't it. I look in the
mirror sometimes and I see
everything falling apart. Fast...

ANGLE - DARYL 278

As an idea comes into his head. He smiles slightly
through his tears.

INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - ALEX - NIGHT 279

Is soaping herself in the bath. She seems very comfor-
table. Then she drops the soap. Her hand feels stiff.
She clenches and unclenches her fist. It feels okay now.
She pulls the plug in the tub and turns ON the SHOWER.
She stands under the shower and rinses herself off.
Slowly, through the following, her body starts to age and
grow fat. We do not see this all at once, but as
follows...

ANGLE - HER HAND 280

reaching for a bottle of shampoo. Her fingers are
thicker, fatter, older.

ANGLE - HER HAIR 281
being rinsed under the shower. The hair is streaked with
gray.

ANGLE - SOAPY WATER 282

running over her feet. Her feet look older, slightly
arthritic. Her legs are beginning to bloat.

ANGLE - SHOWER CURTAIN 283

We hear the SHOWER being TURNED OFF. Then Alex's arm
reaches for a towel. The arm looks thick, heavy.

ANGLE - BATHROOM MIRROR 284

Where Alex's head, covered by a towel, comes INTO VIEW.
And then, Alex removes the towel. The sight is horrify-
ing -- we are looking at an old, sick woman. The hair
is white and sparse, the skin is blotched, hanging
heavily off her cheeks and neck, the breasts are huge
and sagging. Alex sees herself in the mirror. But be-
fore she can react, the transformation continues at a
faster rate. She touches her hair and pieces of it fall
off and shed in her hands. The bones in her hands knot
and protrude under the skin. The skin changes color.
And then real disintegration begins -- as if she were a
corpse and her body were rotting. Finally she screams.
But the sound is inhuman. It is the sound of a corpse
screaming.

INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 285
Carol comes out of her bedroom. She is half asleep. The
SCREAMING STOPS. Silence. Carol walks slowly toward the
bathroom door. She knocks on the door.
CAROL
Mom? Mom, are you in there?
INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - ALEX - NIGHT 286
is on the floor, huddled in a corner of the room, trying
to cover herself with the shower curtain which has been
ripped off its hooks. But there is no need to cover
herself. She is back to normal -- except for a strange
glow which is emanating from her stomach and shining
through the shower curtain.
ALEX
(to Carol)
Yeah. It's okay, honey. I'm okay.

But she continues to stare at the frightening glow.

INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - JANE 290

is asleep in bed. Very quiet. Very peaceful. And then
a faint sound like a RUSTLE. A soft movement in the
room. Jane stirs in her sleep; but she doesn't awaken.
CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO the bottom of the bed. The
RUSTLING sound continues. And then a snake appears
winding its way up the bedpost. It slithers onto the
bed. Jane's feet move under the covers. The SNAKE
HISSES in reaction to the movement.

who sees the snakes on the foot of the bed. She presses
herself against the headboard of the bed, pulling her

knees up against her chest. But there is no escape.

From over the headboard, two more snakes slide down just
past her ears and onto her shoulders. Jane freezes in
horror. The bed slowly fills up with snakes.

EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 303
Alex's car pulls up in front of the house. Alex gets

out of the car and looks at the house. Then she hears

a SCREAM. She runs toward the house.

INT. SUKIE'S KITCHEN - SUKIE - DAY 310

is clearing the table. She looks pale and weak and very
hot and feverish. She carries some dishes to the sink
and starts washing them. Over this we hear on the radio...

RADIO (V.O.)

expected again in eastern Rhode

the continuation of the report...

The stationary cold front is
expected to continue, with highs

coming. Then they pass. She goes to the kitchen table
and sits down.

is still sitting at the kitchen table, wondering what is
wrong with her. She is holding her stomach. Then she
takes one hand and wipes more sweat from her forehead.
Her hand leaves a trail of red on her forehead. She
doesn't see it. But she does notice her hand. It, too,
has red on it. Then she looks down at her lap. What
she sees shocks her. Slowly, she stands up and we see
that the front of her dress is stained with red blood.
It is still wet.

SUKIE
Oh, God... Oh, God...

She stands where she is as blood continues to flow from

her groin, spreading through her dress, running down her
legs and dripping onto the floor.

She's pregnant?

DOCTOR
Oh, yes. Couple of months.

Jane and Alex look at each other.

But the pain continues. And then, slowly, a kind of
soft light begins to emanate from Sukie's stomach. The
sheet begins to glow. On top of being in pain, Sukie
is now terrified. Alex and Jane hold onto her. The
intensity of the light increases until the sheet is
almost transparent.

SUKIE

Make him stop, Alex. Please.

Make him stop.

How are you?

He continues ironing and watching the TV.

ALEX
What are you doing, Daryl?

DARYL
Oh, just catching up with a little
housework. I was sending the
shirts out, but, Jesus, they were
coming back in pieces. Small
town. Not enough Orientals. And
Fidel is all thumbs with this kind
of thing, so -- that leaves little
ol' me...

ALEX
I'm not talking about your laundry,
Daryl. I'm talking about Sukie.
And Jane. And me.

DARYL
Golly, you girls are just having

Yeah. Well, I'm sorry to hear
that.

Are you?
DARYL

Of course, I am.

ALEX
Then do something about it.

minutes later, nobody would give
me the time of day.

ALEX
Daryl, you have to stop this.

DARYL
Stop? Stop what?

ALEX
Sukie could die. Don't you
understand that?

DARYL
I can't help that.

ALEX
Yes, you can. Don't lie to me!

DARYL
You deserted me! We had a deal
and you walked out on it...

ALEX
That's no reason...

DARYL
Yes, it is! You pissed me off.
What was I supposed to do? Take
it like a man?! Christ, I gave
you everything I got. I gave
you more than anybody's ever
given you. And what do I get? A
little ‘thank you'? A little
gratitude? I'11l tell you what I
get. I get screwed.

ALEX
What do you want from us, Daryl?
Just tell me what you want.

ALEX
You're hurting people, Daryl.
It's not right. All the things
you did for us, all those things
you gave us, they are good. But
you can't use them to hurt people.
Don't you see that? Don't you
understand that?

DARYL
No. I just want my family back
together again. That's all. You
and Jane and Sukie. I wouldn't
hurt Sukie. I wouldn't hurt any
of you. How could I do that?
I love you.

ALEX
(with sympathy)
No. You don't know what love is.

could teach me. How hard could
it be?

You have no idea. That's the
thing about women. They have so
much power, but they just don't
know how to use it. I could show
you things...

ALEX
Yeah, I bet you could.

DARYL
How about a kiss? Come on. What
do you say?

Alex doesn't move.

ALEX
What are we going to do with you?

DARYL
There's nothing you can do.
You're stuck with me. Oh, Alex,
let's not fight. There's no way
you can win. There just isn't.
And there's nothing to go back
to even if you could win. Come
on. Can't we put all this behind
us and be friends again? Hmn?

He kisses her.

DARYL

There, isn't that nice? Be honest,
now. Haven't you missed me? Just
a little bit?

Yeah. I have.

We should have saved a little hair.
For his head. He looks funny with

ALEX
Yeah, I know.

JANE
Poor baby.

When she is finished carving, Alex gathers the crumbs
onto the edge of the knife. Sukie holds a match to
them. As they melt, Alex lets them drip onto the groin
of the doll, forming a penis. A LOUD CLANG of CHURCH
BELLS is heard.

Alex reads from a very old book.

ALEX

She passes the book to Sukie. Daryl's DOG starts to
GROWL.

SUKIE
Tzabaoth, Messiach,, Emanuel,
Elohim, Eibor, Yod, He, Vou, He.

ALEX
‘He Vou He'?

SUKIE
That's what it says. Here.

Sukie passes the book to Jane.
JANE
Oh, Alex, I don't know. Could
you leave me out of this? I
think I'm getting a migrane.

ALEX
No. It has to be all three of
us. It was the three of us that
brought him here.

JANE
But it's not fair. Couldn't we
just talk to him?

SUKIE
Jane...

JANE
Okay. Okay.
(she reads)
Astachoth, Adonai, Agla, On, El,
Tetragrammaton... and I hope it
doesn't work.
The DOG starts to BARK FURIOUSLY. The women jump.

ALEX
What's the matter with him?

SUKIE
(to the dog)
Come on, baby. Come on. Outside.

She puts the dog out.

361 ANGLE - THREE WOMEN 361

Each takes a pin and aims it at the doll -- one at the
legs, one at an arm, one at the head.

SUKIE
All at once? Or one at a time?

ALEX
(looking at the book)
It doesn't say.

JANE
Oh, for God's sake. Here.

She jabs the doll's right leg.

SUKIE

Sukie giggles and jabs the arm.

He yelps in pain and grabs his leg.
DARYL

What the hell...?!

COUNTERMAN
Are you okay?
DARYL
No! My leg is... Ahhh!
Another pain -- this time in his arm.
DARYL
(continuing)

Jesus Christ. What is that?!

And finally, an excruciating pain in his head. Daryl
yelps and falls to the floor, writhing in agony. The Man
comes from behind the counter.

COUNTERMAN
Hey, what's the matter?

Daryl can't answer. And then the pain subsides. Daryl
is gasping for breath.

COUNTERMAN
(continuing)
Are you having a heart attack?

DARYL
I'm okay, I'm okay.

He struggles to his feet. He is very shaky. He starts
to leave.

He gives Daryl the ice cream. Daryl pushes some money

at him.
DARYL
Yeah. Thanks.
As he leaves...

Still holding the pins which are stuck in the doll.

SUKIE
Suppose somebody finds us like
this. What do we say?

They laugh and let go of the pins.

JANE
So? What now?

ALEX
I don't know. Why do you keep
asking me? I don't know, I'm
just guessing.

They sit and look at the doll.

JANE
It's sad. You know?

SUKIE
Yeah. It is.

I mean, why don't these things

is limping slightly and holding his head as he makes his
way down the street. Then he gags. Something is in his
mouth. He chokes and spits and, as he does, the feathers
start to come out of his mouth. He looks at the feathers
and realizes what is happening.

Oh, girls. Girls. What are you

blows up around him. Daryl is knocked to the ground.
He struggles to stand up. But the wind is of hurricane
force and it literally blows him down the street.

CONTINUED: 368

People scatter and run for cover as trees fall and cars
are overturned, but the wind is focused on Daryl as he
stumbles, trips, falls and rolls -- trying desperately to
get to some shelter. Blinded by the whirling dust, he
gropes his way toward a building. He feels his way along
the side of the building until he finds a door. He opens
it and the wind blows him into...

INT. CHURCH - DAY 369

Daryl is as surprised as we are to see where he is. A
service was in progress until the great wind blew through
the doors. The congregation and the minister back toward
the walls. Daryl turns to face the wind. Summoning up
all his strength, he fights his way to the doors and,
gathering superhuman power, he pushes them closed. The
WIND POUNDS at the building, but for the moment, Daryl
has escaped it. He catches his breath. He is bruised
badly, his clothing is torn and shredded and he is still
hurting from the pain of the pins. Finally, he takes

in the terrified congregation. He smiles.

DARYL
Sorry... uh... having a little
trouble... having a little trouble

at home. A little domestic
situation. No need to be alarmed.
A little female trouble, that's
all. Hi. How are you?

He laughs as he moves unsteadily up the aisle. The
congregation continues to move away from him. The
minister steers people toward the back of the church.

DARYL
(continuing)
Women. Ha. Can't live with them,
can't live without them.

He doubles over suddenly, gags, opens his mouth and a
stream of grapes comes out of it. The congregation
is amazed. Daryl recovers...

DARYL
(continuing)

Pay no attention. Pay no
attention. Cheap trick. Anybody
can do it. I taught it to them.
Ungrateful little bitches, aren't
they? Let me ask you something.
You're all churchgoing folk.

DARYL (CONT'D)

Let me ask you -- do you think God
knew what he was doing when he
created women? Huh? No shit, I
want to know. Do you think he
knew or do you think it was another
of his little mistakes? Like
earthquakes, and floods. Volcanos.
Tidal waves. Just another little
fuck-up in the divine plan. Like
cancer. Do you think women are
like that?

He gags and spits out more feathers and grapes. The WIND
ROARS outside the church. Daryl is having a harder time
recovering from these fits and attacks.

DARYL

(continuing)
What's the matter? You don't think
God makes mistakes? Sure he does.
We all make mistakes. ‘Course, we
make mistakes and they call it
evil. God makes mistakes and they
call it nature. So what do you
think? Women. A mistake? Or did
he do it to us on purpose? I'd
like to know. Because if it's
a mistake, maybe we could do
something about it. Find a cure.
A vaccine. Build up the immune
system. Eat broccoli. Geta
little exercise. Maybe that's all
it would take. Twenty pushups a
day and you'll never be afflicted
with women again.

An excruciating pain pierces his brain. He grabs his
head, falls to his knees. While he's down, the congrega-
tion moves toward the doors and opens them. The wind

rushes in. The people fight their way out of the church.
Daryl starts banging his head against the floor.

They continue setting the table. Sukie gives Alex the
doll.

SUKIE
Yeah, Alex. Honest. I don't
think we are really evolved enough
for this.

Alex wraps the doll up in some tin foil.

ALEX
Well, you have to believe. That's
all. In yourself. In what you
are doing. Do we want eggs or
french toast? What's the vote?

She tosses the doll onto the counter. As it rolls along
the counter...

is rolling down the aisle of the church. He stops. He
stands up. He looks like he has been in a street brawl.
He waits to see if something else is going to happen.
Nothing. He gathers his strength and walks out of the
church. He is not happy.

Shocked by the sudden appearance and by his appearance,
too. He looks like he has been run over by a truck.

ALEX
Daryl...

SUKIE

Daryl! What happened?

Daryl limps toward the table, holding his head. Jane
grabs his arm to help him, but he yelps in pain and
pushes her away.

the table)
The ice cream melted.

Oh, no.

ALEX
Oh, Daryl.

They rush to help him into a chair.
DARYL
This isn't nice, girls. This
isn't nice. Are you really this
mad? Huh? Are you?

Oh, honey, no.

I didn't make the world. I'm
just trying to survive it.

JANE
Do you want some coffee? I'll
get you some coffee.

DARYL
You got to be a little tough. Dog

way it is. That's God's plan.

Not mine.

The women are running around trying to do everything for
him.

Daryl, I'm sorry...

SUKIE
Do you want a bagel?

Here's your coffee, honey. Oh,
God. Maybe we should calla

SUKIE
Here's your bagel.

DARYL
Could you toast it for me, Sukie?

SUKIE
Sure.

Sukie takes the bagel to the toaster oven, throws it
inside, closes the door without noticing the doll is
inside, and pushes the start button.

He starts to feel warm, uncomfortable.

We hurt each other to survive. We
kill each other to survive.
That's God's plan. No purpose.
No grace. No beauty.

He begins to twitch and transform, a growing darkness
coming over him.

INTERCUT WITH:

FOIL-WRAPPED DOLL 382
In the toaster over, as Daryl speaks.

DARYL
It's a terrible creation, this
world. An unholy war of nature.
Life against life. A parasitic
cellular conflagration.

Daryl's body begins to do peculiar things -- jerking,
changing shapes, as if an internal force were trying to
burst through his skin.

DARYL
(continuing)
You think goodness and beauty and
kindness... You think that's the
way to survive? All right. Let's
try it.
JANE

Daryl! What is happening to you?

The women back away from him. A whirlwind surrounds
Daryl. Starts to levitate.

DARYL
What do you say? Let's rise above
nature. Huh? I am willing to
compromise. Men and women. There
must be a better way. What do you
say we try to find it? You and me.
Screw God. And nature. And all
of nature's violence...

other like this. Do we?

They drink their drinks. Alex looks at Jane,

Just stop it.

You stop it. Stop reading my
