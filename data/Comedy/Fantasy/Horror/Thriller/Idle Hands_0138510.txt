BOLAN, OREGON -- PRESENT DAY

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

A middle-aged, middle-class, woman, NORMA, shuffles through
the bedroom door in dusty, once-fluffy slippers, a cup of tea
in her hand, calling over her shoulder to her husband:

NORMA
Just once a week, Gary. It really
doesn't cost that much.

She turns back the bedspread as GARY follows her in, his bare
feet slapping on the hardwood floor.

GARY
It's a waste.

Norma hangs both of their bathrobes from pegs on the door's
backside and sets her teacup, still half-full, next to the
telephone on a table just inside the door.

She faces him.
NORMA
Betty Johnson won a $500 blackout
last Saturday.

The mattress sags under Gary's weight. He doesn't respond.
She climbs into bed beside him.

NORMA
I'll bet her husband doesn't think
Bingo's a waste. I'll bet he was
happy to help spend that $500.

GARY
Good night, Norma.

He switches the bedside lamp off. In the darkness, they
settle back into the pillows and LOOK UP.

Scrawled on the ceiling in glow-in-the-dark paint are the
chilling words:

I'M UNDER THE BED

Norma SCREAMS.
Sitting bolt-upright, Gary snaps the lamp back on and puts a
steadying hand on his wife's shaking shoulder.

GARY
(gruffly)
That little bastard! If he thinks
this is funny, I'll make damn sure
he thinks again.

NORMA
Check.
‘ GARY
What?

NORMA

Please. Check under the bed.

GARY
It's a prank, that's all. Anton--

NORMA
Anton hasn't been home all day.
He didn't do this. Oh, God, Gary,
what if--

GARY
Norma, no one's there, trust me.

He swings over the edge of the bed, shoving the overhanging
blankets out of his way. Upside-down, he looks under the bed
and then hauls himself back up.

GARY
Okay? Nada. Now, can we--

She gasps, grabbing his arm.

NORMA
I heard something downstairs!

Gary groans.

GARY
Jesus, Norma.

NORMA
Please? I won't be able to sleep.

GARY
(sighing, exasperated)
Fine.
Getting up, he yanks his bathrobe from its peg and opens the
door. .

NORMA
Be careful.

Gary rolls his eyes and heads out.

Norma clutches the blanket tight, listening to his footsteps
descending the stairs and fading into the house until she
can't. hear him at all.

Alone, she fidgets nervously, looking back up at the céiling.
The painted words are invisible in the lamplight.

She scoots into the very center of the bed, gathering the
covers around her, and calls: .

NORMA,
Gary?

She listens hard, her entire body straining toward the open
door, but there is no answer.

NORMA
(louder)

Gary!
A DULL THUD is barely audible, deep within the house.
Her breath catches in her throat and she scrambles off the
bed, hurrying out the door.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME

Norma looks up and down the hall, dark except for a little
moonlight from the windows. The house is quiet.

On tiptoe, careful not to make a sound, she moves along the
wall to a closed door.

She slowly turns the doorknob, opening the door a tiny crack,
and peeks into a BEDROOM.

NORMA
(whispering)
Anton?

The twin bed against the far wall is empty. Norma continues
silently toward the stairwell.
INT. ENTRY WAY, DOWNSTAIRS - SAME

Downstairs, the ceiling creaks as Norma moves above. The
entry way glows. with the soft moonlight filtering in through
frosted windows flanking the front door.

At the bottom of the staircase, beside a small table, GARY'S
HEAD AND SHOULDERS are visible on the floor. His eyes are
wide open and a tiny bit of black-red blood trickles from his
mouth. The rest of his body is hidden in shadow.

Just as Gary's head slides across the floor, DRAGGED INTO THE
SHADOWS by an unseen force, Norma appears at the top of the
staircase. She looks down and sees nothing.

NORMA
(whispering)
Gary? Gary?

She creeps slowly down the stairs, her hands fumbling for the
banister.

At the bottom, she checks the front door. The deadbolt is
fastened tightly and the security alarm panel on the wall
shows that the alarm is still on. She looks around the entry
way.

A slight SCRABBLING SOUND comes from the shadows and she
whirls, stepping toward the noise.

NORMA
Gary, what--

Something SHOOTS OUT OF THE DARKNESS, directly at her. Norma
SCREAMS, covering her face as the thing hits her...

It's a cat, kicking and clawing at her.

Norma breathes in relief, recognizing it. Wrapping her arms
around it, she holds the cat tight and it calms. It's a .
normal black and white housecat.

NORMA
Bones! It's okay, kitty.

She leans to set the cat on the floor.

NORMA
It's okay. Where's Ga--

She stops cold. A small PUDDLE OF BLOOD on the floor
glistens wetly in the moonlight.

She drops the cat and races up the stairs.
INT. BEDROOM - SAME

Norma runs into the bedroom, grabbing the phone off the table
by the door. Holding the receiver to her ear, she rushes for
the bed. Her teacup topples and smashes on the floor as the
phone cord stretches out behind her.

Fingers shaking, breathing hard, she dials a 9, then a 1.
WHAM!

The PHONE CORD IS YANKED behind her. The phone flies out of
her hands.

She whips around to face the door and her face contorts in
PURE TERROR. She SCREAMS.

INT. ANTON'S BEDROOM - DAY

BONES, the cat, leaps onto a rumpled twin bed, jolting 17-
year-old ANTON awake. The clock reads 3:17 PM. Anton
stretches.

In a patch of autumn sunlight, the cat begins cleaning
herself, but she's the only one. Anton merely grabs a faded
purple T-shirt from a pile of dirty clothes on his floor and
heads for the door in a baseball cap and boxers.

INT. LIVING ROOM -— SAME

Anton lights about 30 sticks of incense and plops onto the
couch.

INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME

Bones follows Anton downstairs, pausing at the little PUDDLE
OF BLOOD on the floor, unnoticed by Anton. Bones licks up
the blood.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Anton slides a long, plastic backscratcher from between two
couch cushions. He gives his nuts a scratch or two and then
uses the backscratcher to drag the TV remote over from the

far side of the coffee table.

He flips on the TV and sneaks a look around. Not a soul in
sight.
6

Reaching under the couch with the backscratcher, he pulls out
an already-loaded Bart Simpson bong. Anton sparks up,
inhaling the entire contents through a tube in Bart's butt.

CELEB on TV
You, too, can be financially independent!
Own the house of your dreams, travel,
live in luxury...

Anton exhales slowly, paying rapt attention to the
infomercial until --

CELEB on TV

But this is no get-rich-quick scam. It

requires motivation, dedication, and

good old-fashioned hard work--
CLICK.
Cartoons, much better. As Bones curls up beside him and
cleans blood off her whiskers, Anton's stomach GROWLS loudly.
He glances around and sees a Burger King bag near his feet.

He hooks the bag with his trusty backscratcher and pulls out
a decaying, half-eaten Whopper.

He sniffs the burger, tears some of the green bits off its
perimeter, and takes a bite. He chews once and immediately
spits it back into the bag.

Sighing complainingly, and with exaggerated effort, Anton
shoves Bart back into hiding, hauls his butt off the couch
and plods toward the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN — SAME

Anton pours a bowl of Lucky Charms and opens the fridge.
Barren.

He tilts the milk carton over his cereal.

PLOP. One drop.

ANTON
Mom! We're out of milk!

Mom doesn't answer. DANZIG, the German Shepherd, whines and
pokes his empty food dish with his nose.

ANTON
You hungry, Danzig? What does she
think, you can feed yourself?
~

He gives Danzig a pat and opens a cupboard. It's bare.

ANTON
Mom! We're out of dog food!

Still no response. He pours the dog a bowl of Lucky Charms.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Anton flops back onto the couch, munching dry cereal, and
scans the area. Again, no one's around.

He pulls the bong out again and tries to spark, but the
bowl's empty. He feels around under the couch with the
backscratcher and drags out a plastic baggie.

Empty.

He tries again, fishing out another baggie. Empty. One more
try. He shoves the backscratcher as far under the couch as
he can reach and methodically pats around.

Suddenly, he pulls his hand back, triumphantly clutching his
booty, but this baggie's empty too.

ANTON
Fuck.

He grabs the cordless beside him and punches numbers.
ANTON

(into phone)
Mick, what's up? I'm dry.

MICK
(on phone)
So?
ANTON
So, how ‘bout bringing over a
dimer?
MICK
(on phone)

Yeah, I'll drop it down your chimney
on my way to the North Pole, you lazy
fuck. Come over here and get it.

ANTON
Aw, c'mon. I'm busy.
MICK
(on phone)
Put your dick away and get over here.

BEEP, BEEEEEP. The red battery light flashes on the
cordless. :

ANTON
Fine.

He hangs up and shoves bong and baggies under the couch. He
looks around the room and groans -- his shoes are clear over
by the TV.

But Anton's in luck -- his Mom's fuzzy slippers lay strewn by
the side of the couch, within easy reach of his
backscratcher. Anton doesn't notice the DROPS OF BLOOD
speckling the slippers.

INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME

Anton drops the still-beeping cordless into its base on the
entry table, plucking his sunglasses off the same table and
noticing his mother's purse lying there.

ANTON
(yelling)
Mom!
(no answer)
Mom! Spot me some cash?

Still no answer. Fuck it. He reaches into his mom's purse
and purloins a ten-dollar bill, careful to leave everything
how he found it.

Almost out the door, he looks at the money and rethinks it.
Reaching back into the purse, he grabs another $10.

EXT. STREET - SAME

Wearing his T-shirt, baseball cap, boxer shorts, and blood-
flecked slippers, Anton steps outside. The cold Oregon sun
smacks him in the face and he quickly puts his sunglasses on.
He can see his breath faintly in the brisk October air.

From the house on his left, heavy metal music pounds into the

afternoon.

Sighing, Anton turns right and begins his tiresome journey.
Two houses down the block, he cuts across a yard and climbs
through an open window.
INT. MICK'S BEDROOM - SAME

Anton comes through the window, shivering. MICK, PNUB, and
JIMMY, all high-school seniors, are sitting on Mick's bed,
smoking out and engaging in philosophical debate:

PNUB
Yeah, and if your mom had teeth, she
wouldn't suck dick so well. What's
your point?

Jimmy finishes his hit, passes the bong to Anton, and speaks
while exhaling. .

JIMMY
My point is that, unlike you, Pnub,
I've taken on a certain degree of
responsibility. What's up, Anton?
Nice boxers. -

Anton looks down, slightly embarrassed, at his pantslessness.

PNUB
Responsibility, my nutsack. You
sit around your dad's meat locker
all day and flirt with that old
lady who answers the phone. That
bitch has less teeth than your mom.

JIMMY

You know what these are?

(jangling a ring of keys

in Pnub's face)
These are keys, boy. Keys! My dad's
Placed the ultimate trust in me. I'm
being prepped to take over the entire
meat processing empire.

The bong has traveled full circle and Jimmy pauses for
another hit.

JIMMY

(holding the smoke in)
dust last week, when they installed
this new temperature-controlling
machine -- you guys should see this
monster, it can bring the whole storage
area from 100 degrees to the fucking
ice age in, like, seconds! Anyway,
whose ass do you think was in charge
of overseeing the entire process?

Jimmy stands up and points at his own ass.
10

MICK
We're all really happy for your ass,
Jimmy. Being an enterprising young
man myself, I can relate.

Wearing a "D.A.R.E. to Keep Kids Off Drugs" T-shirt, Mick
pulls out a baggie of pot and exchanges it for one of Anton's
ten-dollar bills.

Anton takes his cap off and slides the baggie into a hidden
slot under the bill.

They all nod.

ANTON
I know I'm jealous. Jimmy can look
forward to a future filled with tooth-
less receptionists and raw meat, while
Mick has a lovely career of license-
plate making just around the corner.

MICK
What about your future, hotrod?

ANTON
I'm not going to worry about that shit.
(taking a hit off the bong)
It's best to just let life happen.

PNUB
At least until your parents kick your
oily ass out.

ANTON
(frowning)
I haven't seen my parents in a couple
of days.

MICK
Maybe they went on vacation.

PNUB
Party at Anton's!

ANTON
No, it's really weird. My mom always
does her shopping on Friday. Yester-
day was Friday, right?

ANTON
So I wake up this morning and there's
no food, no sign of my parents, but
my mom's purse is just lying there
on the table.
11

JIMMY
Maybe they're dead.

Pnub smacks Jimmy's leg.

JIMMY
I'm just saying. With that killer
on the loose and all, you can't rule
out murder.

ANTON
What killer?

MICK
Don't you watch Hard Copy?

ANTON
I hate that fucking show.

MICK
It's also been on the regular news.

ANTON
I hate that fucking show, too.

PNUB
Bolan's national news, Anton. Seems
as if a bunch of hacked-up citizens
have been found in this general area
over the past week.

ANTON
You guys are just fucking with me,
right?

MICK

Well, no, but don't worry. There's
been like three dead people. Four,

tops.
JIMMY
Six.
MICK
(shrugging)

Your parents probably just decided
to slip away for a romantic weekend
and your mom forgot her purse. No
big whoop.

PNUB
At any rate, party at Anton's!
12

Mick lowers the bong and peers out the window.

MICK :
Hey, here comes your woman, Anton.

Anton rushes to the window and ducks.. He slowly lifts one
eye just above the sill so he can see. without being seen.

MOLLY, 17 and drop-dead, zooms past on a Harley.

PNUB
Molly's lived across the street from
you for like, what, ever? I think
it's about time you told her about
your disturbing obsession with her.

JIMMY
While you're at it, you should tell
her your name.

MICK
Back off, guys. Anton doesn't believe
in taking initiative.
(to Anton)
Don't listen to them. You just let
life happen.

ANTON
(giving Mick a dirty look)
I'm gonna do it. I'll talk to her
right now.

He starts out the window.
MICK
You want to borrow some pants, Chief?
First impressions and all.

ANTON
You're a bud.

Mick points at his closet. Anton grabs a fresh pair of jeans
and hastily yanks them on. Kicking off the slippers, he
salutes his friends and crawls out the window.

JIMMY
Think he's got a shot with her?

PNUB
Snowball in hell.

They all nod. Mick reloads the bong.
13

EXT. STREET - SAME

By the time Anton makes it out Mick's door, Molly is already
parking the hog in her driveway, at the end of the block.

Anton crosses to her side of the street and heads toward her
with resolve.

EXT. MOLLY'S HOUSE ~ SAME

Molly slides her leather-clad butt off the seat and
disappears into her house. Anton leans against a tree and
looks expectantly at an upper window.

Sure enough, a light goes on and Molly moves into view in the
upper window, a dark-haired goddess of rebellion.

Anton gazes wistfully, longingly, up at her until she glances
outside and sees him. He averts his eyes and quickly walks
away.

EXT. EUREKA, CALIFORNIA SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY
A huge Winnebago parks in front of the Sheriff's office.

DEBI LECURE steps out of the motor home with a newspaper in
her hand and a parrot on her shoulder. She's about 28, with
long, painted nails and teased Jersey-girl hair.

Debi tosses the newspaper onto the driver's seat and gently
sets the parrot on top of the newspaper. The headline under
the bird reads "SUSPECT CAUGHT IN EUREKA SLAYINGS."

DEBI
(to the parrot)
Wait here, Hot Train. I've got to
look respectable.

Hot Train doesn't respond. Debi slips on a pair of
intellectual-looking glasses and locks the parrot in the
motor home.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - SAME

Debi approaches the DEPUTY behind the holly-decked main desk,
carrying herself stiffly.

DEBI
Excuse me. It's of the utmost
importance that I speak to Sheriff
Buchanan.
14

DEPUTY
Sorry, ma'am, but as you can
imagine, the Sheriff's pretty busy.

DEBI
Perhaps if you understood the gravity
of the situation. . .
The door to the back office opens and a burly tree-trunk of a
man, SHERIFF BUCHANAN, enters the reception area.

DEBI
You must be Sheriff Buchanan. I'm
Debi LeCure.

She extends a hand. The Sheriff ignores it.

SHERIFF BUCHANAN
I thought I ran all you creepy press
people out of here.

DEBI
I'm not with the press. Sir, it's
imperative that I speak with Clement
James right away.

SHERIFF BUCHANAN
Nobody talks to Clement James ‘cept
his lawyer and the investigating
officers.

DEBI
I, too, am an investigator of sorts.

SHERIFF BUCHANAN
Is that a fact? Look, Miss Liqueur--

DEBI
LeCure.

SHERIFF BUCHANAN
Between you and me, there ain't a
whole lot of investigating to be done.
We caught him in his bathroom, shaving
a cat and wearing nothing but his
granny's skivvies. No law against
that yet, but the half-dozen dead
bodies lounging around his house gives
me a wee hunch he's guilty.
DEBI
I don't doubt his guilt. My interest
lies solely with his motive. Has he
attributed his actions to any sort of
supernatural intervention?

SHERIFF BUCHANAN

What information Clement James has
revealed to the investigating officers
is strictly confidential.

(he pauses; then)
But seeing as you're kinda cute and
not with the press, I don't mind
telling you, off the record, that he
ain't said shit. His mind is so far
gone, I doubt if he'll ever utter
another word.

Debi slumps, visibly disappointed.

DEBI
I see.

INT. WINNEBAGO - A MOMENT LATER.

Debi scooches the parrot to one side and climbs into the
driver's seat, dropping both the glasses and the intellectual
act.

DEBI
Well, bird of mine, looks like
another dead end.

Hot Train doesn't answer. Debi starts her engine, crooning
to the parrot.

DEBI
Pretty bird. Hello, pretty bird.
Talk, you fuck.
EXT. STREET - DUSK
Carrying a brown paper sack and a bag of dog kibble, Anton
frowns. He stops walking and looks suspiciously into the
gathering mist around him.

He takes a few steps and looks again. No one.
le,

As Anton continues walking, an UNIDENTIFIABLE FIGURE STALKS
HIM, staying almost entirely under the mist's cover. There's
something SHIMMERY, SILVERY about him, but then again, it may
just be the mist.

The figure pulls back into the shadows as Anton glances over
his shoulder, listening hard.

Suddenly, Anton whips his head around to face his stalker,
put finds only the shifting mist. The SILVERY FIGURE has
VANISHED.

Shivering, Anton steps into the street.

Without warning, he's THROWN TO THE GROUND. His groceries
spill into the street.

A billy club is pressed hard against the back of his neck,
shoving his face into the asphalt.

VOICE (0.S.)
Frisk him. I'll check his bag.

He's thoroughly patted down. His baseball cap is removed and
Anton holds his breath.

VOICE (0.S.)
Roll over.

Anton rolls onto his back to see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE
OFFICERS in their early twenties, sporting the nametags RUCK
and MCMACY.

RUCK
(kicking Anton's grocery bag)
Nothing here. You?

Anton's hat is in McMacy's hands, being inspected. Anton
tries not to look nervous.

McMACY
He's clean.

McMacy leans over and jerks the baseball cap down on Anton's
head, the secret hiding place undiscovered.

RUCK
Damn.

Relieved, Anton scrambles of the street and scoops his
groceries back into the bag.
ANTON
Since when is it against the law
to grocery-shop?
(looking up’at them,
double-taking)
Hey, I know you two. Weren't you
seniors when I was a freshman?

RUCK
(sinister)
That's right. Let's talk about high
school, Anton.

McCMACY
(hauling Anton to his feet)
You and your fancy little clique
zipping around on your skateboards.
Thought you were too cool for us,
huh? Did any of you ever, even once,
invite us to get high behind the gym?

RUCK
(yanking Anton his way)
Or to hang at the half-pipe? Or go
to a punk show?

ANTON
You were dorks!

McMACY
(turning Anton toward him)
But now we're cops, Anton. Your
safety and security, your future
and your very life are in our hands
every single day.

RUCK
Think about that when you try to
sleep tonight.

ANTON
(shaking his head, amused).
Ooh. There's sure nothing scarier
than a spiteful nerd with a power
woody.

RUCK
(marrowing his eyes)
Empty your pockets, boy!

ANTON
Nice try, but they're not even my pants.
Anton pulls. out a crumpled dollar and some change, but
something else comes out too, falling to.the ground ...a
BAGGIE.

McMacy pockets Anton's money and snatches the baggie up. He
opens it and inhales deeply.
MCMACY
Smells like marijuana to me. Write
it up, Ruck. :

ANTON
It's empty!

Ruck scribbles on a ticket pad.
ANTON
What? I know my rights. You can't
cite me for possession of baggie!
Ruck and McMacy laugh.

RUCK
Jaywalking. Maximum fine, $200.

Ruck tucks the ticket into Anton's grocery bag.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Anton tears the jaywalking ticket into strips and lays them
out on the coffee table. Removing his stash from his hat, he
rolls each ticket-strip into a FAT JOINT.

He sits back, lights up, and hears a noise: a FLOORBOARD
CREAKS upstairs. Anton pauses, listening.

Another CREAK, right above him. He mutes the TV. Lying at
his feet, Danzig is PANTING loudly. Anton reaches down and
CLOSES the DOG'S MOUTH.

He listens again, but this time, the house is silent.

He shakes his head, dismissing it, and returns to channel-
surfing.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

As an Everclear video comes to a loud, crashing end, Anton

pours dog kibble into both Danzig's and Bones' bowls. The
pets eat.
19

The familiar notes of the MTV NEWS THEME SONG swell up in the
living room. Watching TV through the open kitchen door,
Anton dumps his groceries on the counter -- bologna, white
bread, mayo -- and starts making a sandwich.

TABITHA SOREN (OS)
This is Tabitha Soren with MTV World
News.

Without taking his eyes off the TV, he opens the silverware
drawer and fishes around, pulling out a huge, evilly sharp
knife -- the blade is covered with DRIED BLOOD.

Anton twists the top of the mayonnaise.

TABITHA SOREN (OS)
There'll be no trick-or-treating for
one town this year. Bolan, Oregon,
a small suburb of Portland, has been
terrorized by seemingly random slayings
for the past week.

Without looking down, he swirls the knife in the mayo and
bits of dried blood come off.

Oblivious, Anton spreads it on his bread, slaps on some
processed meat, and raises the sandwich to his mouth.

TABITHA SOREN (OS)
Six bodies have been discovered to
date and the killer is still at large.
With Halloween only one day away, Bolan
police are advising extra caution...
Anton takes a bite, chews, and
LOOKS DOWN --
The bloody knife sticks out of the rust-flecked mayo.
ANTON GAGS.

In pure terror, he drops his sandwich and flattens himself
against the wall.

ANTON
He's here! He's in my house!

He scans the room, wild-eyed, but the only sounds are the TV
and the dog's eating.

ANTON
(half-whimpering)
Danzig! C'mere, boy.
20

The German Shepherd trots over from his food dish.

ANTON
(whispering to the dog)
If you see, hear, or smell a psycho
killer, you bark. Loud.

Anton points him at the living room and gives hima shove.

INT. LIVING ROOM '- SAME

Danzig SLIDES. across the hardwood floor on his butt, coming
to a stop at the coffee table.

Anton peers out from the kitchen. Danzig looks back at him
quizzically and Anton slips into the room, latching tightly
onto the dog.

: ANTON
Okay, Danzig. We're gonna make it.

He creeps toward the entry way in a panic, pointing Danzig in
the direction of every little NOISE.

INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME

With a firm grip on Danzig's collar, Anton's nearly to the
front door.

TABITHA SOREN (OS)
So, Bolan residents, lock your doors
and stay inside tonight.

ANTON
Fuck that!

He reaches for the doorknob. Danzig BARKS FURIOUSLY at the
door.

ANTON
(deadbolting the door)
Oh, shit! He's out there!

He races up the stairs with Danzig following.

INT. ANTON'S BEDROOM - SAME

Anton slams his door shut, gasping for breath, and climbs
onto his bed, hugging the dog. The house is full of CREAKS
and GROANS, amplified by Anton's fright.
21

ANTON

(to the dog)
Okay, the plan. The killer's on the
porch, but the door's locked. He'll
get bored and go kill someone else.
Psycho killers only come out at night,
so if we make it to morning, we'll be
safe. Piece of cake -- we just sleep
it off.

As he reaches to turn off the light, his closet door CREAKS
OPEN an inch.

Danzig BARKS. Anton bolts from the room.

INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - SAME

Anton tears into the PARENTS' BEDROOM FROM SCENE 1, lit by
the same bedside lamp. The phone is back in its place, but
the long cord is slick with blood. Anton doesn't notice.

He leaps onto his parents' bed, pulls the covers up to his
neck, and cowers. He takes a deep breath and tells himself:

ANTON
The sooner you go to sleep, the
sooner it'll be morning.

He snaps off the lamp and lies back. Looking up at the
ceiling, he freezes, seeing the glow-in-the-dark paint:

I'M UNDER THE BED
Anton is paralyzed with fear. His mouth is open, but silent.

A beat, then Anton hurls himself off the bed and out the door
terror-stricken.

INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME

SCREAMING, Anton flies down the stairs, looking back over his
shoulder in complete hysteria.

On his way to the door, he grabs the cordless off the table,
but the floor-length TABLECLOTH TRIPS HIM.

Anton goes sprawling and the table CRASHES to the floor,
exposing, to Anton's horror --

the MUTILATED BODIES of his PARENTS.

His mother's face is frozen in a pleading expression, her
closed fist held upward by a stiff arm.
22

Anton GASPS.

He glances up the staircase with dread, but the killer has
yet to show himself.

Unlocking the front door, Anton scoops up Bones, pushes
Danzig outside, and runs.
EXT. STREET. - SAME.

Anton races down the block, cat in one hand and cordless
phone in the other, Danzig at his heels.

He hurdles a short hedge, landing in Molly's yard.

EXT. MOLLY'S YARD - SAME

Molly's house is dark. Anton drops to his knees behind the
hedge, trying to catch his breath. Bones and Danzig eye him.

Anton looks through the thick leaves at his house. It's
quiet and still, dark except for the entry way light and the
flickering of the TV in the living room.

He yanks the cordless phone's antenna to its full length and
DIALS 911.

ANTON
(into phone)
Hello, police? The killer's loose
in my house! 3604 Clinton Street.
Please hurry, I don't want to die!

Hanging up, he leans back against the hedge, panting.

IN MOLLY'S UPSTAIRS WINDOW

Unnoticed by Anton, Molly peeks through the shutters and
watches him curiously.

INT. BOLAN POLICE DISPATCH OFFICE — SAME

A very tired-looking DISPATCHER presses the button on her
police radio.

DISPATCHER
One of these calls has to Pay off, over.

EXT. MOLLY'S YARD - SAME

While Molly watches from her window, Anton pulls out a

ticket-rolled doobie. But just as he's about to light up,
Danzig lays his head on Anton's leg.

Anton looks down to pet the dog -- and suddenly spits his
joint across the yard...

His purple T-shirt is speckled with small blotches of paint,
GLOWING in the darkness. He holds up the bottom of the shirt:
a small section of fabric is missing, TORN OFF.

ANTON
Okay. Stay calm.

He whirls to look through the hedge again.

His house is still silent, motionless. No killer in sight.
He stands up, musters his courage, and creeps stealthily
toward his house.

EXT. PORCH ~ SAME

Anton climbs the stairs slowly, alert, but COMPLETELY
EXPOSED.

The front door is still wide open. MTV hums in the living
room. The overturned table is visible, but the bodies are
out of sight behind it.

Anton moves cautiously through the door. Behind him, Danzig
WHINES.

INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME

Standing over his parents' bodies, Anton shields his eyes
from the horrible spectacle.
24

He reaches for his mother's closed fist and
. PRIES HER HAND OPEN to reveal
A PIECE. OF PURPLE CLOTH.

He uncrumples it and holds it to his shirt -- A PERFECT
PUZZLE-PIECE MATCH.

QUICK FLASHES:

-- His mother in the bedroom, pleading, crying,

-- The HUGE KNIFE in his own hand, slicing through the air,
-- His mother tearing at his shirt as she sinks to the floor.

Anton staggers back from the bodies in disbelief.

ANTON
(horrified)
The killer was wearing my shirt!

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Anton stumbles to the couch on automatic. Videos flash
across the TV screen. Anton grabs the remote and switches
channels until he finds the news:

TV REPORTER

+ + + so Bolan city officials have
decided that the local elementary,
junior high, and high schools will
hold Halloween parties in lieu of
trick-or-treating. Kids will be able
to have plenty of safe, secure fun
tomorrow night. Back to you, Bruce.

Zombie-like, eyes glued to the TV, Anton pulls his stash from
beneath the couch and loads a bowl. He takes a huge hit.

Nearby, the cat YOWLS. Anton winces at the sound.

ANTON
(without looking)
Shut up, Bones, I want to hear this.

ANCHORMAN
Several bodies were found in a park
not too far from that high school --
mailman Matthew Wright, who was abducted
somewhere on his route Tuesday, and
Jehovah's Witness Ingrid Renan, who
rang her last doorbell sometime on
Wednesday.
25

The CAT'S YOWLING continues, over and over.

ANTON
Bones! Shut-- .

He turns his head toward the cat and the last word dies on
his tongue .. .«

Next to him on the couch, Bones YOWLS again, with ANTON'S OWN
HAND WRAPPED around the CAT'S THROAT, squeezing.

ANTON
(letting go)
Jesus Christ!

Stunned, he stares at his hand in disbelief.

ANCHORWOMAN
We now take you live to Bolan, where
Jenny Takumatsu has a very personal
story about one of the murder victims.
Jenny?

Anton makes a fist. He opens it. His hand seems to be
responding just fine. He pinches his palm with his other
hand and YELPS in pain.

JENNY
I'm standing outside the local Burger
King, where honor student Kenneth Lippy
made a little extra money manning the
drive-thru...

Horrified, Anton looks at the Burger King bag at his feet,
and then at his hands. He grabs up the bag, crumples it, and
shoves it under the couch as...

the DOORBELL RINGS.

ANTON
The cops!

He hides his pot.

INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME
ANTON
(heading for the door, muttering)
Took ‘em long enough.

His PARENTS' CORPSES stop him short.
26

ANTON
Oh, fuck!

He quickly tries to set the table back up with the bodies
hidden beneath it, but it just won't work -- as soon as he
gets all the arms tucked in ‘under the tablecloth, a leg
sproings out. He. folds the leg in, only to push his Dad's
head out the other side. :

The DOORBELL RINGS: again.

ANTON
I'm coming!
i
He gives the bodies a final, determined shove and the: whole
table TIPS OVER.. Anton groans. The DOORBELL CHIMES
insistently, over and over.

ANTON
Jeez, chill! I'm coming!

Anton shoves his parents into the COAT CLOSET, stands the
table up, and opens the front door.

Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy surge into the room with beer and bud.

MICK, PNUB, JIMMY
Party at Anton's!

Pnub and Jimmy beeline for the TV in the living room and
Anton goes weak with relief. Sweat slicks across his
forehead.

MICK
Hey, you okay? You got a fever?

Mick holds a frosty 12-oz to Anton's forehead.

ANTON
You're not going to believe this.

MICK
What's up?

Taking the beer from Mick, Anton looks carefully into the
living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Pnub and Jimmy are kicked back on the couch, smoking out.

Jimmy changes the channel and Pnub chokes on his smoke,
aggravated.
27

PNUB
What the fuck, yo?

JIMMY
What? .

Pnub grabs the remote and smacks Jimmy with it before setting
the channel back to MIV. "Freefalling" fills the air.

PNUB
Tom Petty rockumentary, dickhead.
Don't change it again. JI want to see
that video where he tools around the
desert in his space buggy.

INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME

Satisfied that Pnub and Jimmy are occupied, Anton twists the
bottlecap off his beer and pulls Mick over to the stairs.

ANTON
Swear to take this to your grave?
MICK
Just tell me.
ANTON
Swear.
MICK
Okay, okay. I swear.
ANTON
I've been --
PNUB (OS)
(yelling)
Anton! You got any grub?
JIMMY (OS)
(yelling)
We're starved!
ANTON
(to Mick)

Stay here.

Pnub and Jimmy are ambling toward the kitchen. Anton races
past them.
28

INT. KITCHEN - SAME

Anton grabs the open mayo jar off the counter -- with the
BLOODY KNIFE still sticking out the top -- and shoves the
whole lot into the dishwasher.

He slams the dishwasher.shut as Jimmy and Pnub enter.

ANTON
Here you go.

Anton gestures to the bread and bologna still open on the
counter.

JIMMY
Wow.

PNUB
You're a great host, Anton.

ANTON
We're out of mayo.

INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME

Mick is taking his jacket off as Anton enters. Anton throws
a panicked glance at the coat closet door, but Mick tosses
his jacket over the banister.

MICK
Well?

Anton guzzles his beer, takes a deep breath, and:

ANTON
I think I might be a psychotic serial
killer.

MICK

Anton, I've known you since third
grade. You're not psychotic.

ANTON
What if I killed all those people
on the news?

MICK
Remember that time me and Pnub pulled
the legs off that grasshopper? You
wussed out.

ANTON
Regardless.
29

MICK
(shaking his head)
I don't buy it. Look at you, you're
normal. .

ANTON
(frustrated)
I'm telling you! I even killed my
own parents. How demented is that?

MICK
Calm down. It's probably just bad

pot. /
A beat as Anton considers this. He looks at Mick hopefully.

ANTON
You think?

MICK
Well, not if you got it from me. I
only sell primo shit.

Anton looks disappointed.

MICK
I'll bet it's just some particularly
gruesome acid flashbacks. Hey! You
know how sometimes when you take acid,
you get so into the trip you forget
you took it?

ANTON
Yeah...

MICK
You're gonna be okay, buddy. Acid
never lasts longer than 12 or 14
hours. I'll ride it out with you,
talk you down.

ANTON
Thanks, Mick. You could be right.
God, I hope you're right.
(beat )
Mick? You didn't take any acid today,
did you?

MICK
Not that I recall.

ANTON
Then tell me if you see what I see.
30

Anton opens the closet door. His Parents spill out at Mick's
feet. Mick takes a step back.

MICK
Fuck me! Anton, you are one sick
puppy -
ANTON
(anguished)

It's true! The killer wasn't just
wearing my shirt, the killer was
wearing me! I mean, I'm the killer!

Anton waves the beer bottle for emphasis as the DOORBELL
RINGS. He turns toward the front door. RED AND WHITE LIGHTS
FLASH outside.

ANTON .
Mick! Help me get the bodies back--

Turning back, Anton sees Mick SLUMP to the floor.

Anton's BEER BOTTLE, BROKEN, is PLANTED DEEP in Mick's
forehead. Anton looks down at his empty hand in disbelief.

The DOORBELL RINGS again and Anton wastes no time pushing the
bodies -- Mick's included -- into the coat closet.

PNUB (OS)
Anton, you want me to get that?

Anton closes the closet door and rubs out a spot of blood
with his shoe.

ANTON
* I got it. It's the fuzz.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
Pnub and Jimmy, destroying the evidence, immediately start
eating their pot and lighting incense, frantically trying to
wave away the smoke hanging in the air.
INT. ENTRY WAY - SAME
Anton opens the door to Ruck and McMacy.

RUCK

Looky who we got here, McMacy. It's
Mr. Baggie.
31

MCMACY
You called, Anton?

ANTON
(feigning innocence)
I did?

RUCK
(checking his pad)
3604 Clinton Street. That's you.

MCMACY
So where's this killer you reported?

ANTON
Sorry, no killer here. Must've been
a prank.

Anton tries to close the door, but Ruck blocks it, leaning
against the doorframe like he's got all night.

Anton points.

RUCK
A prank? You know what the sentence
is for playing games with the law,
Anton?

ANTON
No, see, I didn't prank you. It
must've been, uh, Mick. Yeah, you
guys remember Mick -- he used to skate
past the Physics Club and spit on you.
He lives two houses down.

McMacy pulls out his handcuffs.

MCMACY
Let's take him downtown.

RUCK
I have a better idea. Let's watch
him. Closely.

MCMACY
(nodding)
Every breath he takes.

RUCK
Every move he makes.
(pointing a completely
serious finger at Anton)
We'll be watching you.
32

The cops turn to saunter down the porch steps. Anton slams
the door. He fingers Mick's jacket forlornly before heading
into the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Pnub and Jimmy already have their pot back out, loading their
bowls to the last few notes of “You Got Lucky, Babe." On the .
Tv, Tom Petty drives away in his space buggy and the video
ends.

Anton steps. up behind the couch, visibly shaken.

PNUB .
Anton, dude, that was hairy. I couldn't
even enjoy the video.

JIMMY
You really shouldn't prank the cops,
Anton. They have enough to do, what
with stamping out evil and all.
Where's Mick?

ANTON
He went home with a headache. You
guys should head out too.

JIMMY
What? We're crashing here tonight.
It's cool, the cops are gone.

PNUB
Anton, no one else's parents are
out of town. Don't be selfish.
(motioning. at the TV)
Besides, they're about to show that
Tom Petty duet -- you know, with that
hippie girlie? We can't go now.

ANTON
Seriously, guys, it's for your own
good. I don't think I have a whole
lot of control over--

PNUB
(cutting him off)
Shhhhi! It's on.

Pnub's eyes are fixed on the TV and he doesn't even look for
the cause of the loud, sudden SLICING SOUND next to him, or
the subsequent GURGLE.
33

JIMMY'S HEAD rolls into his own lap, unrestrained by his
neck. It bounces just a little, and continues to the floor,
landing with a dull thud on Pnub's scuffed Chuck Taylors.

ANTON
(aghast)
Shit!!! Pnub, Pnub!

Pnub tears himself from the TV and turns just in time to see
Jimmy's body follow his head to the floor. INNARDS spill out
through a GAPING WOUND in Jimmy's chest.

PNUB
Fucking Christ!

Anton comes around the couch, looking with absolute terror at
the huge knife in his hand. Blood (and a little mayo) drips
from the knife's wicked tip.

ANTON
(freaking)
How does this keep happening???

Pnub scrambles backward into a corner, shaking, as Anton
advances on him, unable to stop.

PNUB
Are you out of your mind?! Snap
out of it! It's me, Pnub, your buddy!

Anton FIGHTS WITH HIMSELF, holding the knife out at Pnub with
his right hand and trying to restrain it with his left.

ANTON
I know who you are, Pnub, you dumb
fuck! I'm not doing this on purpose!

Anton struggles to hold himself back, but she" s drawn
irresistibly toward Pnub.

ANTON
Get out of here! I don't know how
long I can hold off!

Anton steps over Jimmy's body. A bloody ARTERY catches on
his shoe and STRETCHES as Anton moves toward Pnub, slowly
pulling Jimmy's heart from his chest.

JIMMY'S HEART SLIPS ACROSS THE FLOOR behind Anton as. . .

TOM PETTY, STEVIE NICKS
(singing, on TV)
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my,
stop draggin' my heart around...
It's too much for Pnub. He SCREAMS.

Anton looms above Pnub, knife glinting. Pnub covers his head
with his arms.. Anton REACHES DOWN. . .

and grabs Pnub's hand, hauling him to his feet. Pnub
SHRIEKS.

Anton shoves Pnub toward the front door. Giving Jimmy's
corpse a wide berth, Pnub stubs his toes on the TV.

ANTON
Run, damn it!

The knife raises Anton's hand into the air. Anton grapples
with it, using all his might to keep the knife still.

ANTON
Run!

Pnub limps hurriedly for the door as
VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
Kill him.

Anton looks wildly around the room for the source of the
voice.

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(louder)
Kill him!

Anton's own SCREAMS add to Pnub's as his right arm is pulled
back like a catapult by an UNSEEN FORCE.

Just as Pnub reaches the door, the unseen force lets go of
Anton's arm and the KNIFE ZINGS THROUGH THE AIR...

slamming into the back of Pnub's skull with a SICKENING
SMACK.

Pnub crumples. Still SCREAMING, Anton covers his eyes and
runs blindly out the door.

EXT. STREET - SAME

Anton hightails it across lawns and driveways in utter
hysteria, tripping over the hedge and sprawls into Molly's
yard.

Panting, he leaps to his feet and races down the block.
35

EXT. PARK - SAME

Anton half-runs, half-stumbles into the park, gasping for
breath and checking behind him. ‘Several sections of the
park's thick hedge are ROPED OFF with yellow police crime
scene tape.

He rushes for a set of monkey bars, but the entire structure
COLLAPSES just as he's about to duck under it.

Anton veers to the right, floundering into the sandbox, and
the BLOODY KNIFE THRUSTS up out of the sand in front of him.

He whirls again, disoriented, as a DISEMBODIED LAUGH fills
the park, an evil, bone-chilling rumble rising from nowhere
and everywhere.

Anton bones out, heading back towards home.

EXT. STREET — SAME

Anton hurries down the dark street, spooked by every sound
and trying hard to keep a look-out in every direction.

Suddenly, the KNIFE SHOVES THROUGH THE SIDEWALK between his
legs, pointing the tip STRAIGHT UP at his balls.

Anton yelps, startled out of his wits, and dives behind a
bush in someone's front yard.

A LIGHT GOES ON in the house. It's Molly's house. It's
Molly's bedroom light. She opens her window and looks down
at the rustling bush.

MOLLY
Who's out there?

Anton rolls out of the bush, onto the grass.

MOLLY
(smirking a little)
Oh, it's you.

ANTON
(brushes himself off)
Hi. Sorry about your bush.

The KNIFE APPEARS in Anton's hand. He quickly hides it
behind his back and flings it to the ground.

MOLLY
Not a problem. Are you planning
to do this all night?
36

The knife puts itself firmly in Anton's -hand again.

ANTON
Do what?

Behind his back, he tries to drop the knife, but it seems to
be attached. He shakes his hand. The knife remains.

MOLLY
Sneak around my.yard. How many
times have you been here tonight?

ANTON
(distracted)
Uh, twice?

He shakes the knife violently behind his back, but it refuses
to leave his hand.

MOLLY
Wait there.

She disappears from her window. Of it's own accord, Anton's
hand brings the knife in front of his body. His other hand
joins the first on the knife handle and the evil blade POINTS
straight at Molly's door.

Anton immediately turns away. Holding the knife over the
bush, Anton gives his hands a sharp, fierce BITE.

He yelps and drops the knife. It falls into the bush just as
Molly opens the front door.

MOLLY
Get in here before someone sees you.

Anton heads inside and Molly closes the door.

INT. MOLLY'S BEDROOM - SAME

Anton and Molly enter her room quietly. She looks him up and
down.

MOLLY
Jesus, look at you.

Anton looks at himself. His shirt and Mick's pants are
covered with blood, dirt, and bush.

ANTON
I got into a fight at the park.
37

MOLLY .
You sure got your ass’ kicked.

ANTON
I did okay.

MOLLY
So you ran and hid in my bush?

Anton's eyes focus on a letter opener on Molly's desk and
gets a QUICK FLASH of the letter opener VICIOUSLY SLASHING
Molly's throat open.

Anton shakes the image from his head but POTENTIAL WEAPONS
seem to leap out at him: a stapler, an extension cord, a
hairdryer, a Hello Kitty pen and pencil set.

Anton shudders.

ANTON
I really shouldn't be here.

MOLLY
It's okay. My parents sleep like the
dead. Besides, you shouldn't be on
the streets at night. Don't you know
there's a killer out there?

Anton's hands abruptly grab Molly and pull her close,
bringing their faces just an inch apart. Anton plants a
passionate kiss on her.

MOLLY
(coming up for air)
I'm impressed. The way you've been
creeping around and spying on me,
I never would've thought you'd have
the balls to just kiss me like that.

ANTON
(surprised at himself)
Me neither.

She grins and pushes him onto the bed. He pulls off her
shirt. She closes her eyes as he runs his hands up her
stomach, over her breasts . . . and ONTO HER THROAT.

His hands linger, circling her neck, itching to squeeze,

until he forces them to glide over her face and through her
hair.

GRATUITOUS SEX SCENE

EXT. REST STOP - NIGHT

Debi's Winnebago is parked off to the side by itself, as far
as possible from the crowd at the restrooms.

INT. WINNEBAGO - SAME

Hot Train watches the Northern California weather report on a
tiny battery-powered TV.

Across the motor home's one room, Debi untacks newspaper
articles from her-wall. The 20-plus articles clustered .
together all have headlines about multiple murder in Eureka
and suspected serial killer Clement James.

Debi calls over her shoulder:

DEBI
Hello, pretty bird, hello.

Hot Train ignores her.

Debi slips the articles into a file folder headed C. JAMES
and turns. Every wall is plastered with current newspaper
articles. Grouped together by locale, they detail evil of
every sort.

NEWS ANCHOR
(on TV)
According to officials, the Bolan,
Oregon, slayings are the most gruesome
since Jeffrey Dahmer.

Tacked above the TV is a collection of articles relating to
the Bolan murders.

Debi sits next to Hot Train and turns the volume up.

NEWS ANCHOR
Police have yet to pinpoint even
a single suspect ...

Debi hauls a huge road atlas onto her lap and flips it open
to Oregon.

DEBI
Straight up I-5, Hot Train. We'll
be there by mid-morning. Cross
your scaly little bird-toes that
we catch him and end this thing.

Hot Train keeps his eyes on the TV.
39

DEBI
Pretty bird. Hello, hello, hello!
(poking at him)
You know, that pet shop boy in .
Omaha promised you'd be talking by
Texas. If I'd wanted solitude, I'd
have bought a cat.
(beat)
I could still get a cat, you know.
How would you like that?

Nada from ‘the bird.

DEBI
Talk, damn it! Pretty bird, pretty
bird! Look, bird, it's your job,
plain and simple. Do you see me
shirking my duty? Did anyone ask Debi
if she'd like a normal life? Friends?
A relationship? A toilet I don't have
to drain every 600 miles?

She takes a breath.

DEBI
No! Nobody asked and all I have until
this ordeal's over is this crappy
Winnebago and you. The least you could
do is say hello.

Hot Train tilts his head toward her, maddeningly silent.

DEBI
Fine.

She stomps away, snapping all the curtains shut. After
making sure every door is securely locked, Debi crawls under
the kitchen table with the C. JAMES file folder.

A small, thick SAFE is snugly wedged beneath the table.

Debi deftly positions each of the safe's three combination
locks and pulls the heavy door open.

Hundreds of files, each headed with a different name and
packed with newsprint, are stacked inside. As Debi adds the
new file, her hand brushes against the ONLY OTHER ITEM in the
safe:

A tightly-rolled SCROLL of ancient parchment GLOWS brightly
in the dark safe.
40

INT. MOLLY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Anton wakes with a start and looks at Molly. She's lying on
the bed, very still. Panicky, he grabs a hand mirror from
her night stand and holds it to her open mouth. It fogs up.

He breathes a sigh of relief. Putting his clothes on, Anton
goes to the window and stares out at the cold morning,
melancholy, until --

A hand touches his shoulder. Anton whips around in a panic,
but it's just Molly, wrapped in a blanket. She laughs
lightly.

MOLLY
At ease, soldier. What are you doing
over here?

ANTON
Thinking about the snow plow. It's
almost winter.

MOLLY
Hand me that teddy?

Anton gives her the stuffed bear on the windowsill. She
pulls a baggie of The Kind from a hole in the bear's belly
and Anton smiles.

Molly smiles back and rolls a nice, tight joint. They pass
it back and forth.

MOLLY
What about the snow plow?

ANTON

The first really big snow I can
remember, I was four. I was so
jazzed, I spent all day making this
amazing snow fort, with two tunnel
entrances and enough room inside to
stand up straight. It was the biggest,
baddest thing I'd ever done.

(pausing, remembering)
Then my mom called me in. I was at
the window, staring at it, so proud,
when I heard this huge rumble. I
watched, helpless, as a snow plow
flattened it.

He meets Molly's eyes and shrugs.

ANTON
Now I just figure what's the point?
41

MOLLY
Why'd you build your fort in the street?

Anton looks stunned. Finally, in- wonderment:

ANTON
I don't know.

They hear a DOOR CREAK OPEN somewhere in the house. Molly
looks at the clock -- 6:45 am.

MOLLY
Better be on your way, babysnakes.
My parents might take offense to
some dirty, bloody boy banging their
daughter.

Anton looks at his clothes. They haven't gotten any cleaner.

ANTON
Yeah. I've got some things to take
care of.

They can hear her parents now, up and about in the house.

ANTON
I guess I should go out your window,
huh? That always works in the movies.

MOLLY
Hey, whatever loads your bowl. Why
don't you come by around seven? We'll
go to the dance.

ANTON
I thought you said the streets weren't
safe at night.
She pulls him close for a final kiss.

MOLLY
I'll protect you.

ANTON
You're pretty cool.

He swings his legs over the windowsill.

MOLLY
Hey! What's your name?

ANTON
Anton. My name's Anton.
42
MOLLY
Aren't you in my biology: class?
ANTON
(grinning & pushing off)
Yep.
EXT. MOLLY'S YARD - SAME

Anton lands, rolling across the grass under a heavily
overcast sky. He heads for home.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Anton enters to find the scene unchanged. The cat is licking
delicately at Jimmy's open chest wound.

ANTON
Bones! Get away from there!

Bones ignores him. Anton yanks the cat away from the corpse
and holds her tight, surveying the carnage with dismay.

Bones licks Anton on the lips.
ANTON
(pulling the cat away)
Sick!
INT. PORCH - SAME

Anton opens the front door with Bones in his arms and sets
the cat on the welcome mat. He turns back to the. house.

ANTON
Danzig! Danzig, c'mere boy!

The dog joins them on the porch, sitting beside Bones.
ANTON
Guys, this isn't easy for me, but
you have to understand. You're
not safe here.
The pets stare up at him.
ANTON
I think you two will be fine on
your own.

Bones immediately scampers away. Anton looks at Danzig.
43

ANTON
Like I was saying, Danzig, this
is a pretty affluent neighborhood,
so you shouldn't have too much
trouble latching onto someone good.

Danzig continues to stare up at him.

ANTON
Go on.

Anton turns the dog around and gives him a gentle shove.

Danzig goes as far as the sidewalk and looks back at Anton
with pleading puppy-eyes.

Anton takes a big gulp of air.
ANTON
You didn't do anything wrong,
buddy. It's for your own good.

Danzig finally trots off down the street.

ANTON
(calling after him)
Try the Andersons -- they have a

Shitzu in heat!

EXT. BACK YARD - A LITTLE LATER

Anton shovels the final few loads of hard, cold dirt onto a
MASS GRAVE, carefully packs the loose dirt down with the
shovel, and steps back.

He turns abruptly and yanks a flowerless rhododendron bush
out of the ground by the house, re-planting it atop the
grave.

He squeezes his eyes shut for a moment of reflection, but
can't bring himself to say anything over the grave.

Turning away, he sees Danzig peeking around the corner of the
house at him.

Anton sighs sadly, the breath catching in his throat. With
all his might:

ANTON
(yelling at the dog)
Go!
44

Danzig jumps and looks confused, but doesn't leave.

ANTON
Get away! Now!

Anton runs menacingly at him, shaking his fist, and Danzig :
takes the hint. Miserable, Anton watches his dog run. .

A LOW MOAN swells ‘up behind him. Anton turns. The backyard
is empty. Another MOAN...

Anton creeps slowly toward the sound.

MALE VOICE (0S)
(muffled)
Anton!

Anton stops short. The voice seems to be coming from his
fresh grave. A moment's hesitation, and then he goes slowly
to the grave's edge.

MALE VOICE (OS)
(muffled)
Anton, help me!

Anton gasps. Then he shakes his head.

ANTON
(to himself)
It's a trick.

MALE VOICE (0S)
Bro, come on, I can't breathe down
here.

ANTON
Mick?

Anton cautiously leans onto the grave and puts his EAR to the
ground... .-

ANTON
Mick?

MICK (OS)
Yeah, man. Get me outta here!

The voice is undeniably coming from under the ground. Anton
jerks his head away and shoots back.

ANTON
(spooked)
You're dead.
45

MICK (OS)
No, I'm not. You conked me on the
head pretty good. I must've been
unconscious.

Anton wavers uncertainly, but keeps his distance.

ANTON
You think?

MICK
I know, fucker. Dig me up!

ANTON
You're not a flesh-eating zombie,
come back to extract revenge?

MICK
Dammit, Anton!

ANTON
I'm pretty sure you're going to kill
me.

MICK

If I don't get a bong hit soon, I'll
consider it.

The dirt on top of the grave begins to shake.
ANTON
Stop it! You stay where you are,
Mick! You hear me?

The ground starts to rise, cracking open slightly. Anton
glances around wildly.

ANTON
Danzig! Danzig, come back, boy!

But the dog is long gone. Anton is breathing hard, scared
shitless.

ANTON
Mick! If you were ever my bud,
you won't do this.
A chilling MOAN rumbles from the ground as the crack widens.
Anton looks around in a panic for something, anything -~

the SHOVEL! It's on the other side of the opening grave.
Anton crawls toward it on his hands and knees.
46

Taking his eyes off the grave for a split-second, he lunges
for the shovel. Just as his fingers are about to close
around the handle, the shovel is WHISKED AWAY.

Anton spins around.

MICK'S DIRTY, DECOMPOSING BODY is HALF OUT OF THE GRAVE,
broken beer bottle still embedded in his forehead.

Anton falls backward. Mick LOOMS ABOVE HIM, brandishing the
shovel. Anton can barely whisper:

ANTON
Please don't kill me.

Mick RAISES THE SHOVEL. Anton's eyes widen in terror and --

MICK
Don't be stupid. Why would I want
to kill you?

Mick uses the shovel to dig his body the rest of the way out
of the dirt. Glimpses of Jimmy and Pnub's bodies are visible
in the grave.

ANTON
(relaxing a little)
Okay, good. Wow, I'm really glad
you're alive, Mick.

Anton slings an arm affectionately over his buddy's shoulder
-- and abruptly double-takes on the dried blood caked around
the bottle embedded in Mick's forehead. Mick is an unearthly
shade of pale to boot.

MICK
(off Anton's frown)
What?

ANTON
Just a sec.

Anton grabs the beer bottle and YANKS, tearing the broken
glass from Mick's skull. A large CHUNK of MICK'S FLESH comes
away with it, exposing bone, but not a single drop of blood.
Mick doesn't flinch.

ANTON
(backing away)
You weren't just unconscious. You're
dead!
MICK
Well, undead.

ANTON
You lied to me!

MICK
Hey, you killed me! Try to keep this
in perspective. Now chill and listen
to me. I'm supposed to give you a
message from Satan.

ANTON
Right. Look, there's only so much a
guy can accept in one day, alright?

MICK
He said your body count's too low and
you're slacking off. He wants you to
slaughter a few hundred people tonight.

ANTON
Sure, Mick, like I'm gonna believe
that. Yeah, uh-huh, "the devil made
me do it." What, was I possessed?

Anton laughs derisively. Then, suddenly--

ANTON
(realizing)
Actually, you know what? That makes
sense!
(freaking)
Jesus Christ!!! Satan???

MICK
Heavy, huh?

ANTON
Are you sure? I mean, the actual
Devjl?

_ MICK
Yeah. So I'm supposed to scare the
shit out of you now.

ANTON
(to himself)
This is crazy. Crazy! You gotta get
a grip here, Anton.
(to Mick)
Did Satan happen to mention how I
could get him to leave me alone?
48

MICK .
No. Now listen, I'm supp--

ANTON
(deep in thought)
I need an exorcist. A priest.

LOUD MUSIC starts pounding from the neighbors’ place,
snagging Anton's attention. The music is distinctly '80s
metal. It's distinctly Iron Maiden.

ANTON
That's it!

He heads for the fence separating his yard from the
neighbors'.

MICK
(frustrated)
Anton!

But Anton hops the fence and disappears. Mick takes a couple
steps toward the fence, but stops.

MICK
Oh, fuck it.

Mick turns back to the grave and gingerly nudges Pnub's body
with his toe.
EXT. METAL HOUSE BACKYARD - SAME
Anton frantically pounds on the back door.
ANTON
(yanking the door open)
Devon? Joe?
INT. METAL HOUSE - SAME
Anton rushes in. The music is louder here -- Maiden's "666."
ANTON
(yelling)
Curtis? Anyone home?
The living room walls are plastered floor to ceiling with
metal band posters: Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Blue Oyster

Cult, Ronnie James Dio, Motley Crue. A huge cloth Union Jack
covers the picture windows, obscuring the daylight.
49
two dirtheads in their late 20s, CURTIS and JOE, are passed
out on the couch. ~

ANTON
Guys! Wake up!

He tries desperately to shake Joe into consciousness.

JOE
Fuck off.

Joe turns over. Anton shakes Curtis.
ANTON
Come on, wake up! I really need
your help.
Curtis doesn't budge. Anton races for the stairs.
ANTON
(yelling)
Devon! Where ya at?

The MUSIC IS EVEN LOUDER by the front door, coming from the
front yard. Anton opens the door.

EXT. METAL HOUSE FRONT YARD - SAME

Anton trips over the source of the heavy metal: a boombox,
next to a blue Chevy Nova in the driveway.

He goes sprawling, coming face-to-face with a PAIR OF LEGS
poking out from under the MOTHER OF ALL TRUCKS.

Anton tugs on the pantleg in a frenzy.

ANTON
Dev! I need your help.

DEVON rolls out from under the truck, lying on his back on a
creeper -- one of those boards with wheels. About 28, with
scraggly hair down to his shoulders, a thin mustache, and a
black mesh half-shirt, Devon is pure rocker.

DEVON
‘Sup, Anton? Check out the Ford,
man. New shocks and springs.

ANTON
Listen, you've got to help me.

DEVON
Chill, it's okay. I'll buy you beer.
50

ANTON
(shaking his head frantically)
I'm being possessed. Tell me everything
you know about the Devil.

DEVON
Why would I know anything about the
Devil?

Anton points to the boombox.

BOOMBOX
Six, six, six, the number of the
beast...

ANTON

You listen to this shit all the time.
You must have picked up some info on
the guy.

DEVON
Are you out of your fucking mind?
It's just music. Like Mozart and
that other fag --

ANTON
Beethoven?

DEVON
That's the guy. It's just like their
music, only louder. Fucking people
are always trying to read into it,
saying metal controls our minds with
backward messages and shit. I wasted
a whole year trying to hear a back-
ward message on that Judas Priest
album and all I got was a scratched-up
fucking record.

ANTON
I'm telling you, Satan is real and
he's lurking me. If you won't help
me, can I at least borrow your truck?

DEVON
You are out of your mind. You know
no one touches the Ford. I'll take
you for a spin, though, test out my
new shocks.

ANTON
(nodding)
You know where Retirement Haven is?

EXT. BOLAN POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Debi's motor home monopolizes several spaces in front of
Bolan Police Headquarters. Beside it, Ruck and McMacy pull
a HANDCUFFED GUY out of their squad car.

GUY
Hey, I'll give you guys fifty bucks
if you let me go.

The two cops look at each other.

RUCK
Each?

The guy nods. Ruck and McMacy make sure the coast is clear
and uncuff him.

INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - SAME

Sniffling and looking bereft in head-to-toe black, Debi is
seated at a desk in the bustling office. Across the room, a
junior officer points her out to CAPTAIN TIDWELL.

Captain Tidwell strides over, offering his hand to Debi.

CAPTAIN TIDWELL
I'm Captain Tidwell. I understand
you're Ingrid Renan's sister?

Debi dabs at her eyes with a Kleenex and smiles up at him
through her tears.

DEBI
Yes. Lisa Renan.

CAPTAIN TIDWELL
My condolences, Miss Renan. Terrible,
terrible.

DEBI
Thank you for seeing me, sir. I have
to know if there's been any news at all.

CAPTAIN TIDWELL
My force is doing everything in our
power.

DEBI
Please understand, it's just so hard
to sit at home not knowing who or why.
If you could just tell me you have a
suspect, my family could rest easier.
Captain Tidwell sighs and ushers Debi into an office.
closes the door.

CAPTAIN TIDWELL
As the entire town is aware, the
killer hasn't left a single clue.
I'll be straight with you -- now
that the killing seems to have
stopped, we have little to go on.

DEBI
Stopped?

CAPTAIN TIDWELL
Not a single body has been found in
the past several days. Happens all
the time. These nuts quit as suddenly
as they began. The harsh truth is,
it's likely we'll never discover his
identity.

DEBI
(dropping her bereaved act)
Fuck.

INT. MOBILE HOME - A MOMENT LATER

Debi sits at the kitchen table.

DEBI
Missed him again, Hot Train.

Hot Train eyes her in silence.

Dejectedly, she begins taking Bolan-related articles down

EXT. RETIREMENT HAVEN - A MOMENT LATER

Anton hops out of Devon's truck and Devon peels out.

EXT. RETIREMENT HAVEN ~ A MOMENT LATER

Anton walks down a long hallway peppered with OLD PEOPLE. As
Anton passes him, a particularily ancient GENTLEMAN slips
from his wheelchair and falls to the floor, DEAD.

Anton immediately looks at his own hands as an ORDERLY rushes
over to check the guy for any signs of life. .

ANTON
(seriously distressed)
I didn't even touch him, I swear!

The orderly gives Anton an odd look and Anton hurries down
the hall. .

INT. GRAMS' ROOM - SAME

GRAMS is knitting in an overstuffed easy chair as Anton
appears in the open doorway. He knocks on the door frame.

GRAMS
Anton! How nice of you to visit!

ANTON
How's it going, Grams?

GRAMS
Come in. Sit, sit.

Anton pulls up a chair.

GRAMS
Look how you've grown! You're
getting to be such a handsome
young buck. How are your parents?

ANTON
That's kinda what I want to talk
to you about. ..

A. badly-wrinkled OLD MAN moseys in and sits on the arm of
Grams’ chair. He puts his hand on her knee.

GRAMS
Anton, I'd like you to meet my
boyfriend, Leon.
54

ANTON :
I was hoping we could speak in
private.

LEON

Let me tell you something, sonny.
If I had a horse, I'd buy it oats
and fuck it.

ANTON
Is that right?

GRAMS
You can speak freely in front of
Leon, dear. ‘He's a few sandwiches
short of a. picnic.

ANTON :
Pickin's are pretty slim here, huh,
Grams?
Grams sighs and nods.
ANTON

Grams, I really need your help. I
know you believe in superstitions
and all that dark magic stuff.

GRAMS
Ran my own cult for 35 years.

ANTON
Yeah, so I figured you'd understand.
See, I...1...

GRAMS
Spit it out, dear.

ANTON
The Devil is using me as an instrument
of death.

LEON
Boy's a killer, Reba.

GRAMS
Hush, Leon. Anton, I'm really not
surprised.

ANTON

You're not?
GRAMS :
The way your parents raised you,
letting you sit around on your
duff all day watching TV, it makes
perfect sense. Did you learn one
single constructive thing today in
school?

ANTON
It's Sunday, Grams.

GRAMS
(shaking her head)
It's the old Idle Hands clause.
Satan is taking his due.

ANTON
What?

GRAMS
Idle hands are the Devil's play-
ground, Anton. I don't blame you,
of course.

ANTON
(frowning)

Thanks.
GRAMS

It's your parents' fault. You've
always been a very lazy boy and
they've done nothing to correct it.

LEON
I've always said this younger
generation is lazy. You need to
learn discipline and self-control.
Whoops, soiled myself again.

Leon hops out of the room.

GRAMS
Hand me the phone, Anton. We'll get
your parents over here and put an
end to this.

ANTON
(very quietly, pained)
Grams, I killed Mom and Dad.

GRAMS
Oh, dear.

55
56

ANTON
And my friends and-- Oh, no!
Grams, what if I . . . What if the
Devil makes me kill you, too?

Anton staggers backward with huge, scared eyes.

ANTON .
I better go.

GRAMS
It's okay, Anton, I have an idea that
just might save you. Come here.

Anton approaches her reluctantly.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

The TV is on and Anton is kicked back in his usual spot on
the couch, happy as a clam.

ANTON
(to the TV)
You tell ‘em, Mr. Furley!

PAN DOWN to reveal Anton's hands busily KNITTING. About 30
feet of green scarf stretch across the floor.

ANTON
(laughing at the TV)
And to think, it's all just a big
misunderstanding.

Suddenly, the front door flies open. In walk the decomposing
bodies of Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy, their death wounds gaping.
Jimmy holds his head in one hand and his heart -- still
attached to his innards by a vein ~- in the other.

ANTON
(leaping to his feet)
Stay back!
MICK
Relax. We're not here to kill you.
ANTON
Are you bringing another message from
Satan?
PNUB

No, we just need a place to kick it.
The three corpses plop down on Anton's couch.

MICK
Turns out we didn't make the cut.
Heaven or Hell. We're fully border-
line.

PNUB
So now we're in limbo until we avenge
our deaths.

ANTON
(backing up against the TV)
I knew it! You guys are gonna smite
me!

MICK
Dammit, Anton, calm down. We like
limbo. It's cool, we get to just hang
out. No school, no jobs, nothing's
expected of us.

JIMMY'S HEAD
Anton, you're blocking the TV. Jack's
about to accuse Janet of being a dyke.

Jimmy holds his head out to the side to can see around Anton.

ANTON
You're lying. You guys came from hell.
Why else would you bring a message from
Satan?

MICK
He knew we were coming back to Earth,
so he stops me on the way and asks me
to do him a favor. What am I gonna
say? No?

PNUB
Yeah, why would we go to Hell? We're
not evil. I mean, it's not like we're
good or anything, but at least we don't
go around killing people.

ANTON
Hey, fuck you, I didn't kill anyone
on purpose.

MICK
So you knit now?
58

Anton looks down at the knitting needles in his hands.
They're idle. He immediately starts knitting again.

ANTON
Yeah, my grandmother broke it down
for me. Idle hands are the Devil's
playground. I have to keep my hands
busy.

MICK
Anton, I don't think that saying is
meant literally. It's more, you know...

PNUB
Metaphorical.

MICK
Right.

ANTON

(shaking his head)
My hands are the only things I. have
trouble controlling. The rest of
me responds to my brain just fine.
The knitting keeps my hands. occupied
while freeing my mind up for other
stuff.

Anton squeezes onto the couch with the guys and starts
watching TV, knitting away. Mick fishes the bong out from
under the couch and lights up.

EXT. ANTON'S HOUSE -- SAME

A cop car pulls up. Ruck and McMacy hop out and sneak around
the side of the house.

RUCK
Let's see what our boy's up to.

They peek in a window and GASP as they see Anton knitting
next to three motionless, open-mouthed corpses. Jimmy's head
rests on his lap.

Ruck and McMacy duck down.

RUCK
Holy shit! Anton's the killer!

McMACY
(standing)
We better call for back-up.
59

RUCK
(pulling McMacy back down)
Hold on a sec. If we bring him in
ourselves, we'll be heros.

McMACY
Yeah! But can we do that? I mean,
we can't break in there without a
warrant.

RUCK
Piss on the Bill of Rights! We've
got just cause! There are three dead
kids in there, one of ‘em missing a
head. Nobody's gonna fault us for
bringing that sicko to justice.

MCMACY
Okay, let's do it.

RUCK
One more thing. That's kid is obviously
a Grade-A psychc. Don't feel compelled
to bring him in alive.

McMACY
I never do.

The cops draw their guns and creep toward the front door.

INT. ANTON'S LIVINGROOM -- SAME

The four kids sit glassy-eyed on the couch, staring through a
haze of pot smoke at the TV as . . . Ruck and McMacy kick the
door in, guns pointed at Anton's head.

RUCK
Freeze!

Anton jumps up. The other three don't even twitch. Anton
looks at the cops and then glances wildly around the room in
a trapped panic.

ANTON
Guys! What's should I do?
PNUB
(turning)
I think--
McMACY

(shooting Pnub in the head)
Aaahhhh!
60

PNUB :
(rubbing his new bullet wound)
I was gonna say I think you should
do what the officers tell you, but
I changed my mind.

MICK
Really, man. Just kill ‘en.

McMACY
(bewildered)
They're alive!

RUCK
They are not. You just shot one in
the head. And that one's head isn't
even attached. They're obviously
zombies or something. :

ANTON
(to the boys)
Look, I don't want to kill anybody.
Well, anybody else, at least.

JIMMY'S HEAD
You don't want to go to jail, though.

ANTON
Jail! That's it! I'll give myself
up and they'll put me in a rubber room
where I can't hurt anyone!
(to the cops)
Here, cuff me.

Anton holds his hands out in front of him, continuing to
knit. Ruck holsters his gun and pulls out his handcuffs.
McMacy keeps his gun trained on Anton.

RUCK
Okay, now drop the knitting needles.

ANTON
Believe me, that's not a good idea.
Just cuff me already.

But as Ruck reaches out to slap the cuffs on, Anton SPEARS
Ruck's hand with one knitting needle and THRUSTS the other
needle through the underside of Ruck's jaw, up into his
brain.

Lightening-quick, Anton spins Ruck's body around, using it as
a shield, as McMacy FIRES his first shot.
61

As bullets spray the dead cop's chest, Anton pulls Ruck's gun
from its holster and SHOOTS McMacy right between the eyes.

Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy applaud. Anton drops Ruck's body

ANTON
(distressed)
Stop that! It wasn't me! I had no
control over my hands. The fucking
knitting didn't help at all.

MICK
See? I told you that saying was
metaphorical.

ANTON

Oh, shitit!!
He points the gun at the cop corpses in a panic. The dead
boys look at him, puzzled.

ANTON
Ruck and McMacy are gonna try to
avenge their deaths now! Stand back!

PNUB
Their asses went straight to Hell,
Anton. Heaven frowns on dirty cops.

MICK
Didn't you see those little black
demons whisk their souls away?

Anton shakes his head.

MICK
(to Pnub and Jimmy)
Maybe you gotta be dead to see that.

As Pnub and Jimmy agree, Anton throws the gun down and stares
at his hands, distraught.

ANTON
What the fuck am I going to do?
Satan obviously isn't going to let
me turn myself in.
(a beat, then--)
I know!

He marches into the kitchen. The guys haul themselves off
the couch and follow him.
62

INT. KITCHEN -- SAME

Anton grabs the still-bloody knife and pulls out the cutting
board. He lays his right hand on the cutting board and
RAISES THE KNIFE with his left.

. MICK
Oh, no way!

ANTON
It's the only thing I can think of.

1 JIMMY'S HEAD
I can't watch!

Jimmy turns his head to face his own gaping chest.

Anton grits his teeth, raises the knife high in the air, and
SWINGS it down. The knife STOPS in mid-air, less than an
inch above his right wrist.

PNUB
(relieved)
I knew you wouldn't do it.

ANTON
(struggling to push
the knife down)
It's not me. Satan's trying to stop
me.

Anton shuts his eyes and concentrates, trying with all his
might to force the knife down, but it WON'T BUDGE.

Finally, he jumps into the air, using the entire weight of
his body to press down on the back of the knife, forcing it
THROUGH HIS WRIST and bringing it to a satisfying THWACK
against the cutting board.

Anton SCREAMS like a man who just cut his own hand off. He
lifts his right arm...

Not only is blood spewing out fast and thick, but his hand is
still PARTIALLY ATTACHED to his wrist. It DANGLES by a
thread.

MICK
Oh, sick.

Anton, grimacing in incredible agony, grabs his right hand
and JERKS IT OFF.

He SCREAMS even louder this time. He grips his bloody stump
and falls to the floor in pain.
63

PNUB
That looks bad. You should really
put something on it.

Mick grabs a small kitchen towel, wraps it around Anton's
stump, and secures it with a rubberband.

MICK
That'll stop the bleeding, but how
the hell are you planning to cut off
your other hand??

Anton frowns. Holding the knife in his left hand, he makes a
few backwards slashing attempts, but doesn't even come -close
to reaching his left wrist.

He tries to position the knife above his wrist with his right
arm, but he can't push it through. He turns to the guys.

ANTON
Mick, be a bud and cut off my hand?

MICK
(shaking his head)
Too gross.

ANTON
Pnub?

Pnub shakes his head too.

ANTON
C'mon, Jimmy. Please?

Jimmy's head dry-heaves.

ANTON
Fine. Fuck you guys then.

Leaning over, Anton lays his left hand on the floor, nudges
the knife up onto his wrist, and tries to push it through
with his FOOT -- but the blade just keeps falling sideways.

He doggedly goes back to the cutting board. He grips the
knife in his TEETH and bobs his head up and down over his
arm, but can only make pathetic little scratches.

MICK
(gently)
I really don't think self-mutilation's
the answer here, Anton. I mean, you're
dealing with Satan -- no matter what you
do, he'll find a way to fuck with you.
64

Anton suddenly spits the knife out and clutches his towel-
wrapped stump, wincing hard.

PNUB

You okay?
ANTON
(in agony)

The pain's really starting to kick in.

He holds his arm tight against his chest, sqeeezing his eyes
shut and breathing hard as .. .-

the tip of a shiny, double-edged BLADE pokes through the
bloody towel, EXTENDING from Anton's wrist. Anton SCREAMS,
but he doesn't see the blade growing wickedly upward, heading
for the soft underside of his chin.

The guys GASP.

MICK
Anton, look out!

Anton's eyes spring open as Mick grabs his arm, pulling the
blade's tip away. As Anton stares in horror, the knife
continues to GROW straight out of his stump. When it reaches
a foot long, it stops and glints evilly.

ANTON
Jesus.

MICK
I knew you couldn't outsmart Satan.

JIMMY'S HEAD
At least you can cut your other hand
off now.

They all look at Jimmy.

JIMMY'S HEAD
If you still want to, I mean.

PNUB
Look at that fucking thing. It's gonna
get infected for sure.

MICK
Anton, you got any antiseptic?

ANTON
(in shock)
I don't know.
65

MICK
Don't worry, I've got a first-aid kit
at my house. We'll just hop over and
grab it.

PNUB
You wait here, Anton. Try not to move,
or you'll lose more blood. We'll be
right back to fix you up.

ANTON
(dazed)
Okay.

The guys take off and Anton is left alone in the kitchen. He
starts to bury his face in his hands, but thinks the better
of it and buries his face in just his left hand.

On the floor below the cutting board, Anton's DISMEMBERED
HAND lies in a pool of blood. Suddenly, a FINGER TWITCHES.

Anton's face is still hidden as his right hand starts INCHING
slowly toward him...

Undetected, the hand crawls up his pantleg and onto his
shirt, but when the hand brushes against the bare skin at the
base of Anton's neck, Anton looks down.

Before Anton can react, the hand has him by the throat. He
falls back against the floor, struggling for breath and
pulling at the hand with his left hand.

He can't budge the hand. It SQUEEZES TIGHTER. Anton's face
goes pale as he tries to wheeze. The hand's knuckles turn
white, squeezing hard.

Anton works his blade-appendage between the hand and his
throat. Cutting his neck badly in the process, Anton manages
to pry the hand loose.

With one hard jerk, he sends the hand flying. It smacks
against the fridge and falls to the floor, MOTIONLESS.

From out of nowhere, CHILLINGLY SINISTER LAUGHTER erupts.

As Anton glances around the room in a panic, searching for
the source of the laughter, the hand SPRINGS back up and
flies at him as a FIST. It PUNCHES Anton in the jaw.

He reels back, punch-drunk, too dazed to resist as the hand
grabs Anton's left wrist and sets it on the cutting board.
The evil hand seizes the knife Anton used earlier and RAISES
IT above Anton's left wrist as...
66

the DOORBELL RINGS.

Anton snaps.out of his daze and pulls his left arm away just |
as the evil hand THWACKS the knife against the cutting board.

The doorbell rings again.

MOLLY (OS)
(calling)
Anton?
ANTON
Shit!

He goes to look at his watch, but it's still wrapped around |
the severed wrist -- FLYING through the air, knife pointed at
Anton's face.

Anton blocks. it with his own blade. As they SWORDFIGHT ...

MOLLY (0S)
Anton! Are you home?

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
Molly, isn't it, Anton?

Anton's eyes widen in fear.

ANTON
Don't hurt her! I'11l do whatever
you want, just don't hurt her!

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
I'm not going to hurt. her.

Anton looks sick. He eyes his severed hand with new dread.
The doorbell RINGS again.

ANTON
(yelling)
Molly, get the fuck out of here,
you bitch!

The evil hand pushes its knife hard against Anton's blade,
backing Anton up against the counter. Beyond it, Anton can
see DOWN THE HALL into the entry way -- Molly's pressing her
face against the frosted glass, trying to look inside.

MOLLY
Anton, quit being cute and let me in!
67

Anton struggles to shove the hand's knife back, but the hand
is stronger. It forces Anton's own double-edged blade to
press against his face. It BREAKS THE SKIN on his cheek and
blood trickles down.

EXT. ANTON'S FRONT PORCH -- SAME

Molly's dressed in a nun's habit. A wooden cross sticks
straight out from her chest and blood glistens around the
fake wound.

MOLLY
Dammit, Anton, we're late! I'm
coming in.
INT. KITCHEN - SAME
The knife presses deeper into his face.

ANTON
No! Stay out, Molly, I mean it!

EXT. ANTON'S FRONT PORCH -- SAME

Molly tries the doorknob. The door swings open easily,
having been kicked in earlier by the cops. She steps inside.
INT. LIVING ROOM -- SAME

Molly steps over the two cop corpses with a puzzled look.
STRANGE SOUNDS ‘can be heard from the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN -- SAME

Anton reaches to the side with his good hand and pulls a PAN
out of the sink. He gives the evil hand a good WHACK,
knocking the knife from its grasp.

While the hand is momentarily stunned, Anton grabs it and
SHOVES it into a ceramic Cookie Monster COOKIE JAR.

Holding the cookie jar shut between his chest and right arm,
he pulls rubberbands from a drawer and fastens the cookie jar
lid on tight.

He sets the cookie jar back on the counter just as Molly
enters. She takes in the bloody cutting board, bloody knife,
bloody floor, and bloody Anton with a ANNOYED SIGH.
VO
. WB.
Look, you should've called. You
needed more time to do your costume,
fine, but I hate waiting. Let's.go
already.

ANTON
Molly, I'm the killer.

: MOLLY .
Uh-huh. Not real original, you know.
Half the kids at the dance'll be dressed
as the killer. That knife hand's kinda
¢ool, though.

She reaches out to ‘touch it. Anton backs. away from her.

ANTON
I'm not kidding. You've got to get
out of here.

MOLLY
What's up with those dead cops in your
living room? They look pretty real.
Are they part of your costume?

ANTON
Molly, listen to me! I--

He stops in surprise as his blade arm turns horizontally in
front of him and RAISES itself into the air. As Anton stares
at it, stunned, the blade PULLS him toward Molly.

He pulls back with his good hand, but it's no use. His feet
slide across the floor as he struggles to stop himself.

ANTON
(coming at her uncontrollably)
Molly, run!

MOLLY
Save it for the costume judges. Can
we go now?

As his blade reaches her throat, Anton shoves Molly back with
his good hand, trying to keep her out of cutting range. Up
against the back door, she rolls her eyes.

MOLLY
(unenthused)
Fine. Help, help. The killer's
got me.
69

But the blade closes in on her despite Anton's efforts. It
presses against her throat.

MOLLY
Anton, quit it! That hurts!

ANTON
(struggling)
I'm trying! I can't help it!

She tries to push him off her, but can't. He tries to hold
the blade back, but can't.

ANTON
I'm sorry, Molly. There's nothing
else I can do.

He leans in, kisses her, and PRESSES HIS OWN THROAT AGAINST
THE BLADE.

ANTON
At least Satan won't win.

In one swift movement, he jerks his head sideways, SLITTING
his own THROAT.

Everything goes BLACK.

INT. WINNEBAGO - EVENING

Debi pours Hot Train a dish of birdseed. The parrot hops
wordlessly onto the edge of the dish and eats, flinging seed
and shells everywhere.

DEBI
(disgruntled)
Not even a thank you?

EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME
Debi steps out. The motor home is parked beneath the neon,

coffee-cup shaped sign of THE HOTCAKE HOUSE. Debi slams the
Winnebago door.

DEBI
Dumb bird.
She stalks into the diner as a blue Chevy Nova -- carrying
Devon, Joe, and Curtis -- cruises into the lot, blasting

Motley Crue's "Shout At the Devil."
INT. ANTON'S KITCHEN -- SAME

CLOSE ON Anton's slit throat as the gash miraculously seals
itself shut. It doesn't look pretty, but it's obviously
doing the job because Anton sits up, dazed.

ANTON'S POV: Everything's blurry. He can hear:

MOLLY
(shrieking in terror)
Anton! Anton, help!

But he can't see her. He shakes his head and focuses on
jagged pieces. As his vision sharpens, the pieces become
broken cookie jar. shards on the floor.

Anton turns immediately to see his disembodied hand CHOKING
Molly against the back door. Her screams fade; she BLACKS
OUT and COLLAPSES onto the floor.

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
I'll always win, Anton.

The spine-chilling laughter fills the room again as Anton
hurls himself toward the unconscious Molly. He lifts his
blade to SPEAR the hand, but stops abruptly.

On second thought, he uses his good hand to bend back the
evil hands fingers one by one. He pries the hand loose and
it turns on him, bitch-slapping Anton across the face.

Anton stumbles back. The hand flies at him again, but this
time, Anton puts his knife-hand up to block it -- and the
hand IMPALES ITSELF on Anton's blade.

Anton opens the MICROWAVE, flings the hand in, shuts the
door, and turns it on HIGH.

The evil hand's skin bubbles and then bursts against the
microwave door in.a mess of seared flesh and blood.

ANTON
Gross.

INT. HOTCAKE HOUSE - SAME
Devon, Joe, and Curtis lift their overloaded food trays from

the buffet line and look around the crowded Hotcake House.
Every table is occupied.
71

Debi is sitting alone in a booth, barely picking at a pizza-
sized pancake. Devon gives her his best puppy-dog eyes.

DEVON
Excuse me, ma'am? Do you mind if
my friends and I share this booth
with you?

DEBI
(not looking up)
Hal :

Devon, Curtis, and Joe look at each other and shrug. They
slide into Debi's booth and begin devouring their food,
talking with their mouths full.

CURTIS
(to Debi)
Hey, you got the pizza-sized pancake
too.

Debi doesn't look up.

DEVON
Do you live around here?

CURTIS
No, I live over --

DEVON
Not you, dick, her.

DEBI
(looking up)
You want to know where I live?

Devon nods and then adds:
DEVON

Not like we're loony or anything.
We won't stalk you.

DEBI
I have no home. I don't get to have
a home.

JOE

You need a place to crash?

DEBI
Let me ask you something. How did you
guys spend your day today?
72

JOE
Hungover.

CURTIS
And Dev. spent hours laying on his back
in the driveway.

DEVON
(nodding)
New shocks.

DEBI
I've never had a driveway. I've never
even had a hangover.

The guys. look at her with pity.

DEBI
You know how I spend my days? I
drive around the country looking
for the Devil.

CURTIS
What are you, some kind of freak?
You've really never been hungover?

Devon kicks Curtis under the table, but Debi ignores them.

DEBI
That's right, Satan himself. Oh, I
know what you're thinking. Why would
a clever, yet attractive, young woman
waste her life away searching for
Satan? Because I have to. It's my
freaking destiny.

Devon, Curtis, and Joe have no response to that.

DEBI

That's right. I'm not a religious
zealot or a cultist. Evil doesn't
even bother me all that much. I just
have absolutely no say in my own life.
And here's the kicker.

(they stare blankly at her)
I actually have the one thing that
can rid this world of Satan forever
-- on an ancient scroll passed down
through generations of LeCure women
-- a holy incantation that will
banish the Prince of Darkness to hell.

Devon, Curtis, and Joe shovel food into their mouths.
The guys shrug.

73,

DEBI
I know what you're thinking. Of course
there's a catch. In order to send the
Devil packing, I have to read the
incantation to his face.

JOE
(pointing at her pancake)
You gonna eat that?

DEBI
Help yourself. But reading it to his
face is virtually impossible, you under-
stand. Satan almost never appears on
earth himself. He uses humans —- the
weak-minded and slothful -- to do his
dirty work.

DEVON .
(to be polite)
Why is that, anyway? Why doesn't he
do it himself?

DEBI
Are you kidding? Do you have any idea
how hot it is in Hell?

DEBI
Even the hottest places in the world
must be thousands of degrees below
what Satan's used to. The Devil can't
hack the cold long enough to do much
evil himself.

JOE
(skeptical)
He gets too cold??

DEVON
Duh, Joe. Why do you think there's no
crime in Antarctica?

(to Debi)
So. How does one go about tracking
Satan?
DEBI

I'll tell you.

She waits for them to egg her on. They don't.
DEBI
I read the papers and watch the
news. When I hear about a deranged
serial killer on the loose, odds are
Satan's involved. I head to that
town in hopes of finding the Devil
before he moves on to the next schmuck.

DEVON
Weird. Satan's like the topic of
the day or something. Earlier today,
Anton told me Satan was possessing him.

Eyes wide, Debi ‘reaches across the table and grabs Devon by
his Black Sabbath concert T-shirt.

DEBI
Don't screw with me, mister.

Devon pulls his shirt from Debi's grip.

DEVON
Ease up there, kitten. I'm telling
you the truth. He was pretty freaked.

DEBI
Tell me where he lives. Now!!!

INT. ANTON'S KITCHEN -- SAME
Anton's checking Molly's pulse -- he finds it.

ANTON
Thank God!

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
He had nothing to do with it.

Anton turns, looking around wildly for the source of the
voice, but again he finds no one. He puts his good hand
protectively on Molly.

ANTON
(to the room in general)
What do you want?

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
Kill her.

ANTON
No!

74
He turns back to Molly in a panic. 7 5,

ANTON
Molly! Molly, wake up! You have
to get out of here. Molly!

He slaps her face gently with his good hand. She doesn't
stir. .

As Anton slaps her harder, desperately, his knife-hand RISES
at his side. Unnoticed, it positions itself above Anton's
head, its vicious point AIMED at Molly's forehead.

Anton turns from Molly in despair -- and sees his reflection
on the oven door: the blade PLUNGES toward Molly.

Anton CATCHES THE BLADE in his good hand, just inches from
her face. Blood trickles from his fist, around the sharp
metal and down his wrist, as he jerks himself away.

He kicks the back door OPEN and runs out.

EXT. HOTCAKE HOUSE PARKING LOT - SAME

Debi scrambles into the driver's seat clutching a hand-drawn
MAP on a napkin.

DEBI
Hang on, Hot Train. We hit the
jackpot!

She peels out. On the other side of the restaurant window,
Devon, Curtis, and Joe shake their heads and continue eating.

EXT. BACKYARD -- SAME

Anton's good hand is trashed -- the palm is deeply sliced.
Ignoring that, he grasps the blade again and PULLS with a
vengeance, trying to yank the blade from his stump . . . No
luck.

He peeks under the dishtowel -- his stump has FUSED SHUT
around the base of the knife -- it's now part of his body.
The wound is compltely closed and the blood is gone, but it's
hideous-looking. Anton jerks the dishtowel back into place.

ANTON
(yelling, enraged)
I will not do this anymore! I'm going
back inside and calling an ambulance
for Molly..
76

He glances around the dark back yard defiantly, waiting for a

response. Getting none, he adds:

ANTON
Ya fuck.

As he stalks back toward the house, a sudden wind comes up,
rustling the leaves on the ground and CHILLING Anton to the
bone. He stops short.

SINISTER WHISPER BEHIND HIM
Oh, Anton. . .

Anton slowly turns -- to find no one. He turns back toward
the door and. finds himself face-to-chest with THE DEVIL.

Anton jumps. Satan looms over him, 8 feet high with horns,
tail, and forked tongue, a deep blood-red. on closer
inspection, his body is a sea of constantly moving blood,
with small wormlike creatures swimming in it.

ANTON
(terrified)
Holy shit!!!

SATAN
You're going back in there alright --
to kill her.
(moving slowly in on Anton)
See, the way it works is, you're my
bitch. You live to pleasure me.

Anton inches away, unable to run, eyes wide with fright.

SATAN
And tonight's a big night for you.
If you can't get it together to kill
one dumb chick, how are you going to
slaughter several hundred of your peers?

ANTON
(barely squeaking it out)
Why me?
SATAN

You, Anton, are the result of a
millennium of carefully planned DNA
experimentation. You're the supreme
sinner, built to butcher.

ANTON
(stunned)
Really?
77

SATAN
Don't be stupid. You're just a
random choice. Now listen, you have
the perfect set-up tonight.

ANTON
(whimpering)
You don't need me. You could do it
yourself. Please, just let me have
my life back.

Satan grabs Anton by the collar and LIFTS HIM OFF THE GROUND.
He's face-to-face with the Devil and scared out of his mind.

SATAN

Get this through your head, boy.
You have no life to get back.
You're a murderer. You killed your
parents and your friends. You have
have a knife for a hand, and you're
right-handed.

(laughing)
You think you can have a normal life?
Your only path lies with me now.

EXT. STREET - SAME

The Winnebago takes a corner at top speed.

The large vehicle leans precariously, racing on two wheels
for an instant before righting itself with a thud. Debi
doesn't slow down.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME

Molly comes to and gets up, looking extremely confused.

EXT. FRONT OF ANTON'S HOUSE -- SAME

Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy head down the sidewalk toward Anton's
house carrying a first-aid kit, some frozen burritos, and
Jimmy's head, respectively.

They see Molly step out of Anton's house, rubbing her
temples. She crosses the street toward her own house.

PNUB
Think they did it?

MICK
Or he tried to kill her.
78

EXT. BACK YARD —— SAME

Anton looks down, cringing, as Satan continues to hold him
off the ground and rant. Little flecks of Satan-spittle fly
into Anton's face.

SATAN
I turned you into a killer piece by
piece, Anton. You belong to me.
Now get in there and kill that girl.

Anton musters his courage. He takes a deep breath, and then
another, and then:

ANTON
(timid but determined)
I can't. I love her.

Satan throws Anton to the ground in disgust.

SATAN
You would never even have spoken to
her if it wasn't for me. I got you
laid. I made you kiss her. You
think a ballsy move like that came
from your own will?

ANTON
(in disbelief)
You wouldn't do anything good for me.

SATAN
Anton, I'm the Devil. I'm into lust.
I take time out for a good fuck-show
whenever I can.

ANTON
(aghast)
You watched???

Satan grins evilly and SHIVERS in the cold wind blowing
across the yard.

ANTON
(getting to his feet)
You know what? Fuck you.

INT. WINNEBAGO CAB - SAME

Debi checks the map, catches sight of a street sign, and

suddenly yanks the wheel. They fly into an intersection,
against a red light. Traffic on all sides screeches to a
halt. Debi keeps going.
79

Hot Train flaps his wings furiously, trying to maintain his
balance amid the chaos of the cab.

INT. KITCHEN -- SAME
The dead boys arrive to find Anton gone.

MICK
He must be in the pisser. Fire
those up, Pnub. I'm starved!

Pnub opens the microwave door and the HAND-- now nothing but
a skeleton with a few chunks of cooked flesh clinging to the
bones -- FLIES OUT at him.

The hand zooms past Pnub's head, crashes through a window,
and DISAPPEARS into the night.

The boys look at each other. They don't know what to say.
Mick shrugs.

Jimmy holds his head up to look at the blood and guts in the
microwave.

JIMMY'S HEAD
Maybe we should clean it first,

PNUB
Yeah, and while we're at it, we'll
just clean the whole fucking house.
This isn't our mess.

He rips a paper towel from a roll and places it in the
microwave. He sets the frozen burritos in on top of it and
turns the microwave on.

EXT. BACK YARD -- SAME

Arms crossed over his chest, bored out of his mind, Satan
taps his fingers on one arm as the WIND PICKS UP.

ANTON
(fuming)

+ + « and, you big, red fuck, you're
right, I don't have much of a life
anymore. But I'll be damned if I'm
gonna spend the rest of it killing
people so you can get off.
80

SATAN
(shivering in the cold wind)
You're already damned.

ANTON

(throwing his hands up)
So what? Hell can't be worse than
this.

(realizing something)
And I've been resisting you. If you
were so all-powerful, I would've
killed Molly already. That's why
you showed up, isn't it?

Satan's eyes blaze with'’rage. He tries to uncross his arms,
but his JOINTS have STIFFENED in the cold.

Anton looks puzzled as Satan grimaces and forces one stiff
finger to POINT at the ground.

A RING OF FIRE springs up around the Devil. He moves his
arms and shoulders slowly as his JOINTS WARM and loosen up.

Suddenly, a strong wind blows the fire out.

SATAN
(annoyed, shivering again)
Look, I don't have time for this.
You don't want to be the predator?
Fine. Let's see how you like being
one of the prey.

Anton suddenly SCREAMS and clutches his knife-hand ...
At the base of the knife, BLOOD seeps through the dishtowel
wrapped around his stump. Anton HOWLS in intense PAIN.

Satan's freezing, his TEETH CHATTERING in the cold, but he
can't leave before basking in Anton's agony.

SATAN
You're no longer under my protection,
Anton. How does it feel?

ANTON
(gritting his teeth)
It's worth it.

SATAN
(laughing)
You think you've stopped me? My plans
don't revolve around some piddly human.
Enjoy the massacre!

Satan vanishes. Anton books for the back door.
81

INT. KITCHEN -- SAME

His stump DRIPS BLOOD across the kitchen floor as Anton
rushes in to find Molly gone.

ANTON
(yelling, panicked)
Molly??

He hears voices in the living room...

INT. LIVING ROOM -- SAME

Anton hurries in to find Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy kicking it on
the couch, watching TV.

ANTON
Guys! Where's Molly??

MICK
She left. So did you guys do it?

Anton rushes to the door, frantic.

ANTON
(barely paying attention)
No. Well, yes, but not today--

He's interrupted by the DING of the microwave. He stops with
his hand on the doorknob, eyes wide, turning toward the
kitchen in horror.

PNUB
Hey, since you're up, would you grab
those burritos out of the microwave?

ANTON
Don't tell me you let my hand out??!

The guys look at each other, slightly embarrassed. Mick
lights the bong.

JIMMY'S HEAD
We brought you a first-aid kit.

ANTON
Where's my hand??

PNUB /
It broke a window and bolted. There
wasn't anything we could do.
82

ANTON
Shit. Look, I have to find Molly. Now
that I'm not the killer anymore, I--

MICK
You're not?

ANTON
Satan let me off the hook.

MICK
Well, alright then.
(offering Anton the bong)
Take a hit and relax.

ANTON
I can't. I mean, I really should
check on Molly. Plus, Satan plans
on offing a whole shitload of people
tonight, and my hand is out there
doing who knows what. Don't you
think I should do something?

MICK
What for? It's not your problem any-
more. Let the cops handle it.

Anton looks down at the two dead cops at his feet.

ANTON
Still, I feel kinda responsible.

PNUB
No one's blaming you, Anton. Come
on, take a hit. Maybe we'll head
Over to the dance later.

ANTON
(gasping)
The dance! That's where Satan wanted
me to go! He's.gonna kill everyone
at the dance tonight!

MICK
Calm down, Anton. There's nothing
you can do. I say just kick back
and forget about it.

ANTON
No. Not this time.’ I've spent my
whole life--

MICK
Okay, okay. No speeches. Just go.
83
ANTON
Right.
He grabs a set of keys off the desk and leaves.
PNUB
Maybe we should go to the dance now.
You know, before Satan kills everyone.

JIMMY'S HEAD
Yeah. I bet you I win Best Costume.

Mick and Pnub narrow their eyes at Jimmy's gaping chest wound
and severed head.

MICK
You can't go like that, Jimmy.

PNUB
We'll touch you up a bit.
EXT. STREET - SAME
Debi's motor home zips past the park, turning onto Anton's
street.
INT. ANTON'S GARAGE - SAME
Anton plops down into the seat of his Dad's sportscar. He
looks from the STICKSHIFT to his bloody blade hand. It's not
gonna work.
ANTON
Fuck!
EXT. FRONT YARD - SAME
Anton races into the front yard and glances around. Through
the chain-link fence, he sees DEVON'S TRUCK parked in the
driveway next door.
Just beyond him, Debbie's Winnebago is hauling ass toward his
house.
INT. WINNEBAGO - SAME
As Debi roars into Anton's DRIVEWAY, she sees Anton hopping

the fence. She quickly flips her napkin-map over to reveal a
crude sketch of Anton's head.
84

DEBI
We've got him, Hot Train! Look out,
Satan, we're right on your ass!
She scrambles from the cab to her living room and dives under
the kitchen table, spinning the safe's combination locks.
EXT. METAL. HOUSE DRIVEWAY. - SAME

Devon's truck is unlocked. Anton yanks the door open and
jumps in.

With Hot Train perched on her shoulder, Debi hurls herself
out of the Winnebago. The ANCIENT SCROLL GLOWS in her hand
as she races. around the fence toward him.

IN THE TRUCK

No keys. Anton shoves the tip of his knife blade into the
truck's ignition and gives it a quick twist. But...

The base of the blade ROTATES IN HIS STUMP instead of in the
ignition. Anton YELPS and rips off the dishtowel -- now
soaked through with blood.

No longer fused shut, his stump is the gory open wound it
should be -- but with a knife shoved into it.

He wiggles the knife -- it's slightly LOOSE.

Holding it firmly with his good hand, Anton WINCES as he
forces the kinife-tip to turn in the ignition.

IN THE DRIVEWAY

Just as Debi rushes up the drive, yelling --

DEBI
Anton? Anton, wait!

-- the truck ROARS to life.

IN THE TRUCK

Twisted Sister's "We're Not Gonna Take It" immediately
blasts from the tape deck, obliterating the sound of Debi's
yelling.

Anton throws the truck into reverse.
85

IN THE DRIVEWAY
BAM! The back of the truck SLAMS FULL-FORCE INTO DEBI.

The SCROLL GOES FLYING and Hot Train flaps his wings like
crazy as Debi's shoulder drops out from under him.

Debi lands at the edge of the driveway.

IN THE TRUCK

Braking, Anton looks startled and confused. He checks his
rearview mirror. Seeing nothing, he shrugs and continues
backing out.

BAM!

One of the back tires goes up and over something.

BAM! The front tire follows suit.

Anton shakes his head and whips the truck onto the street,
snapping off the cheesy ‘80s metal.

ANTON
Damn, Dev, your new shocks suck!

Devon's creeper rolls in the truck's bed as Anton roars away.

IN THE YARD

A few feet from Debi's lifeless form, the scroll is glowing
softly, lodged in a flower bed. Using his beak, Hot Train
PULLS the SCROLL FREE.

DOWN THE BLOCK

Just a few houses away, ANTON screeches to a STOP in front of
Molly's house.

ACROSS THE STREET

A LITTLE BOY lovingly wraps his arms around Danzig's neck and
looks pleadingly up at his MOTHER.

She nods and smiles, and the boy's face bursts into a huge

grin as they lead Danzig into his new home. Danzig bounds in
happily.
86

INT. ANTON'S KITCHEN - SAME

Mick PLUNGES a FORK, pronged-side up, into the top of Jimmy's’
pulpy neck. He takes Jimmy's head off the counter and SLAMS
it down onto the fork, bringing head and neck together again.

Pnub pokes Jimmy's forehead. The head wobbles slightly.

PNUB
Still a little loose.

Mick finds a roll of duct tape in a drawer and wraps it
around Jimmy's neck, TAPING his head on tight.

MICK
Lift your arms.

Jimmy holds his arms away from his chest. His heart falls
out, dangling by an entrail. Pnub shoves Jimmy's innards
back in as Mick DUCT TAPES him shut.

JIMMY
How do I look?

MICK
You'll probably still win Best
Costume. Come on.

EXT. ANTON'S FRONT YARD ~ SAME

The guys head out of Anton's house. Hot Train hops across
the yard toward them, with the ANCIENT SCROLL clutched safely
in his beak.

Mick's eyes light up. He points excitedly at the Winnebago
in the driveway, motor still running.

MICK
No way! How convenient.

They walk right past Hot Train and the scroll, and open the
Winnebago doors.

Hot Train flies up into a tree, and TEARS THE SCROLL TO
SHREDS, lining his new nest with glowing bits.

HOT TRAIN
(singing)
It's like raaaaiiin on your wedding
day, it's a free ride, when you've
already paid...
87

EXT. MOLLY'S HOUSE - SAME

Anton rings the doorbell repeatedly. Molly's FATHER opens

the door.

MOLLY'S DAD
There's no trick-or-treating this
year, son.

ANTON
I know. Is Molly here?

MOLLY'S DAD
Are you the little bastard who stood
up my daughter?

ANTON
No, sir. I'm just a little late.

MOLLY'S DAD
That costume of yours is in very
sick taste. Do you think these
murders are some kind of joke?

The Winnebago, with Mick at the wheel, cruises past behind

Anton.

ANTON
No, sir, I don't. Look, I really
have to see Molly.

MOLLY'S DAD
She got sick of waiting for you and
went to the dance alone, and
I must say I think she made a wise
choice.

But Anton's already racing toward the curb.

INT. WINNEBAGO - SAME

As Mick drives and Jimmy fiddles with the radio from the
passenger seat, Pnub explores the living area.

He looks over the murder-oriented news clippings above the
refrigerator and then opens the fridge. His eyes go wide.

PNUB
Beer!
88

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - SAME

Lame Halloween decorations deck the walls. Costumed
TEENAGERS mill about as a BAND PLAYS an horrible, pointless
cover of Kenny Loggins' "Danger zone" on the stage and a few
adult CHAPERONES lean against the walls.

Molly enters in her nun's outfit and her friend, TANYA, joins
her at the punch table.

TANYA
Hey, Moll. Nice costume.
(touching the BLOODY CROSS
Plunged into Molly's chest)
What are you, a vampire?

MOLLY
(still foggy)
No.
TANYA
So I thought you were bringing your
new guy.
MOLLY

He never showed, the fuck. I fell
asleep waiting for him and now I
feel all gross and groggy.

TANYA
Ouch. Stood up.

Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy saunter up, doing their best to hide a
few beers in. their pockets.

MICK
Hey, girls.

TANYA
Wow, you guys look great! Who did
your make-up?

MICK
My friend, Anton.

Mick raises his eyebrows suggestively at Molly. She glares.
Tanya rubs her fingers along Mick's forehead wound.

MICK
Careful. There might still be
some glass in there.
89

TANYA
Cool.

CUT TO:

Another part of the gym. A bored adult CHAPERONE stands
guard at a doorway. He hears a NOISE and looks behind him,
peering into the dark hallway.

A lightening-fast skeletal HAND JABS him through the eyes,
boring into his brain. The chaperone's SCREAM is drowned out
by the BAND's deafening song-ending climax.

BACK AT THE PUNCH TABLE:

JIMMY
This band sucks.

CUT TO:

An UNSEEN FORCE drags the dead chaperone into the dark
hallway.

BACK AT THE PUNCH TABLE:

Jimmy turns from the band to see Tanya deeply french-kissing
Mick's decomposing mouth.

JIMMY
Oh, that's disgusting.

PNUB
It's fucking illegal.

Pnub pries Mick away from Tanya.
PNUB
C'mon, man, you're dead. Think
about it. It's gross.
Mick shrugs.
MOLLY
(sighing)
I'm going for a walk.

As she disappears through the door left unguarded by the now-
dead chaperone...
90

Anton bursts into the gym, his stump bloodier than ever and
mushy with DECOMPOSING FLESH around the knife.

ANTON
(yelling)
Stop the dance!

The band crashes to a halt and all eyes turn to Anton.

ANTON
I'm the killer!

A sea of Jasons, Freddies, Mansons, and Nightstalkers stare
at him for just a second before going back to their
conversations. The band resumes playing.

Anton runs on-stage, grabbing the microphone from the singer.
The band stops again.

ANTON
(into the mic)
I'm not fucking around!

CHAPERONE
Hey, watch your language.

ANTON
I'm not messing around. You're all
in danger here. Go home! The devil's
coming to kill you all!

The student body scoffs.

ANTON
Really! He already made me kill
my parents, a couple of cops, and
Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy!

The crowd turns collectively toward the punch table, where
Jimmy is emptying a BEER into the punchbowl. Anton looks
stunned to see them there as the three dead boys wave at the
crowd.

MICK
It's true!

JIMMY
(hiding the beer bottle)
Yeah, he sliced me up real good.

The crowd laughs, dismissively turning away from Anton.
Deflated, he hands the mic to the singer and mopes over to
the punch table.
91

ANTON
Stupid idiots. They're all gonna
die and there's nothing I can do
about it.

MICK
Uh-huh.

JIMMY
At least they'll get to live it
up before they're systematically
slaughtered, thanks to me.

He slides another beer from his pocket and pops the cap off
with the bottle-opener on his keychain. Anton stares at the
KEYCHAIN as Jimmy pours the beer into the punch.

PNUB
You can't spike punch with beer,
dipshit. Like the whole school is
gonna get drunk because you added
a beer or two to that bowl.

JIMMY
I'm not done.

Jimmy pops another beer open as Anton continues to focus on
the keychain. Suddenly-—-

ANTON
That's it! I know how to defeat
Satan!

JIMMY
With beer?

ANTON
No. Jimmy, I need to borrow your
keys.

JIMMY

(handing them over)

Okay.

ANTON
Great.

(heading for the door,
turning back)
Hey, has anyone seen Molly?

MICK
She went for a walk.
92

ANTON
Shit! Look, could you guys find.
her and get her out of here? I
don't want anything to happen to her.

: MICK
No problem.

ANTON
Thanks. I'll be right back.

Jangling the keys, Anton bolts.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -. SAME

Molly stops at a water fountain, leaning over to drink, when
she hears:

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
Molly.

MOLLY
(jerking up)
What?

Silence. Frowning, she’ wipes water droplets off her mouth
and looks around. A little ways down the hall, a LIGHT
FLICKS ON inside a classroom. The door is slightly ajar.

Molly slowly, cautiously approaches the classroom. A sign on
the door reads "SHOP ROOM."

She steps in. The door SLAMS shut behind her.
MOLLY (OS)
(piercing scream)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!
CUT TO
A large, red slab of MEAT hanging from a hook. Anton pushes

a huge, metal MACHINE through the meat warehouse toward an
open door.

EXT. MEAT-PACKING PLANT - SAME
Devon's truck is parked beside the building, below the sign:

WARDEN MEATS. The warehouse door is open and Jimmy's keys
dangle from the lock.
93

On the side of the meat-packing plant, a silver, industrial
garage door slides up and open with a CLANG.

The massive machine -- with FREEZE-WHIZ 4000 painted on the
side -- is balanced precariously on the little creeper from
Devon's truck.

Steadying the Freeze-Whiz and pushing from behind, Anton
grunts with effort.

As he rolls the machine toward the truck, a sudden wind comes
up. Anton shivers in the breeze and...

HEARS a SCRAPING SOUND. He cocks his head and listens-
Nothing. He peers over the top of the Freeze-Whiz. Nothing.

Then the sound comes again -- SCRAPE . . . SCRAPE... It's
coming from behind him. He very, very slowly turns to look
over his shoulder... .

and sees nothing.

Grimly holding his knife-hand at the ready and keeping a
sharp, suspicious look-out, he continues on toward the truck.
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME

Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy creep cautiously down the dark hallway.
They HEAR SOMETHING.

JIMMY
Did you hear something?

PNUB
Yeah. It sounded like flesh being
ripped off.

MICK
We better check it out.

Mick starts forward, but Pnub and Jimmy hesitate.

MICK
Quit being pussies. It's not like
we're gonna get killed again.

They move covertly down the hall and the FLESHY NOISES get
LOUDER. They round a corner and see FIGURES lurching in the
shadows.
94

Jimmy grabs one of the figures and pulls it into the light
+ - . it's a costumed TEENAGED GIRL, and Jimmy's holding onto
her by the boobs.

GIRL
Let go, fucker.

Before Jimmy can react, the girl's BOYFRIEND steps out of the
shadows and PUNCHES Jimmy in the face.

Jimmy's head FLIES OFF and rolls down the hall. His body
just stands there with a fork sticking out of his neck.

The girl SCREAMS and runs away. Her boyfriend SCREAMS and
runs after her.

The guys shrug, Jimmy retrieves his head, and they continue
the search down the hallway, past the closed Shop door . . .

INT. SHOP ROOM - SAME

CLOSE ON: Molly's chest as the WOODEN CROSS is yanked out of
her nun's habit by an unseen hand. We don't see her face;
she doesn't resist.

CLOSE ON: A whirring, industrial-strength SANDING MACHINE.
The blunt end of the cross is held to it by the same unseen
hand and the powerful sander quickly files it into a SHARP

POINT.

INT. GYM/DANCE - SAME

No one notices as each set of the gym's double doors, open to
the parking lot, CLOSE SILENTLY, seemingly of their own
accord.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME

Devon's truck is parked at a reckless angle in the lot.
Anton wheels the Freeze-Whiz, on the creeper, up to the
closed gymnasium doors.

The horrible band can be heard covering "The Eye of the
Tiger" as Anton tugs on a door handle. The door won't budge.

Puzzled, he pushes the machine around a corner of the school
and finds a single door -~ UNLOCKED. Victorious, he wheels
the Freeze-Whiz in.
95

INT. POOL ROOM - SAME

In the weird blue light of the deserted swimming pool, Anton
goes to plug the Freeze-wWhiz into a wall outlet, but before
he gets there...

A quiet CREAK is barely audible from across the room. Anton
whirls around to inspect the room -- a door is OPEN at the
far end.

Anton frowns at it, hesitating -- was it open when he came
in? But nothing moves. Even the water is still. Shrugging,
he plugs in the Freeze-Whiz. It powers up with a LOUD ROAR.

ACROSS THE ROOM

The open door slams SHUT, but Anton can't hear it -- or
anything else -- over the WHIR of the Freeze-whiz.

UNIDENTIFIED POV:

Something's in the room with Anton. His back is turned, he's
fiddling with the Freeze-Whiz's temperature dial, as it
APPROACHES him stealthily. Whatever it is, it's practically
breathing down Anton's neck when he TURNS . . .

Anton JUMPS, startled, and then looks relieved.

ANTON
Molly! God, I'm glad to see you!

Molly's standing in front of him, hands OUT OF SIGHT behind
her back. She smiles.

ANTON
I want to apologize for, you know,
earlier. Hey, guess what, though?
I'm not the killer anymore, so you
don't have to worry!

MOLLY
(still smiling)
I'm not worried. .

ANTON
Good, ‘cause you've gotta understand
that I'm not really like that. I'm
a nice guy.

As he rambles, we PAN DOWN behind Molly to reveal the
SHARPENED CROSS clutched behind her back.
96

ANTON
Thanks for being so cool about this.
You have no idea what it's like to--

Molly brings the cross up over her head and PLUNGES it toward
Anton's skull. He scrambles out of the way just in time.

ANTON
Jesus Christ. I guess you do know
what it's like!

He backs away as Molly advances.

ANTON
Molly, you don't know what you're
doing. I werit through that stage
too. You've got to try and clear
your head.

Molly stabs at him again, but Anton blocks her cross with his
blade hand, slightly CUTTING HER HAND in the process.

MOLLY
(screaming)
!

She clutches her cut hand in pain.

ANTON
(going to her)
I'm sorry.

Molly BURIES the cross in Anton's shoulder. He howls as she
pulls it out and stabs at him again. This time, he moves
before the cross finds its mark.

ANTON
(backing up against the
high dive ladder)
Molly, listen to me. I've got a
plan to defeat Satan. Your part
is easy. All you have to do is not
kill me.

She's inching toward him, not listening. With his back
pressed against the ladder, there's nowhere to go but up.
Anton climbs up a step.

INT. GYM/DANCE - SAME

The girl and her boyfriend from the hall stand by the punch
bowl, talking to Tanya.
97

BOYFRIEND
»- + - and then his head came off! It
looked so real.

TANYA
Have you guys noticed that all the
chaperones have disappeared?

GIRL
They probably went to find a better
party. This band sucks.

BOYFRIEND
Yeah, let's get outta here.

Tanya, the girl, and her boyfriend head for the exit, where a
CROWD has gathered. They try the doors.

BOYFRIEND
(pulling harder)
Hey, this is fucking locked!

SOME GUY
Yeah, man. We just tried to leave too.
It's no use.

GIRL
There's a door in the pool room that's
always open. I think the lock's busted.

BOYFRIEND
Cool.

Pretty much all of the students head into the dark hallway.
The band keeps playing.

INT. POOL ROOM - SAME

Molly and Anton are up on the HIGH DIVE. Molly LUNGES.
Anton SLIPS, falling flat on his back. She looms over him,
brandishing her cross as...

the HAND flies into the room with blood dripping from its
skeletal fingers. It beelines straight for the Freeze-Whiz
and SHUTS IT OFF.

Anton hears the machine sputter and go quiet. He turns his
head to look and Molly STABS him in the shoulder again.
Anton SCREAMS.

Mick, Pnub and Jimmy come into the pool room.
98

MICK
(pointing)
There's that hand!

JIMMY
(holding his head onto his
. neck with both hands) :
Hey, that's my Dad's Freeze-Whiz 4000!

ANTON
Guys! Guys!

The guys look around the room, confused. On the diving
board, Molly stabs at Anton's chest. He blocks it with his
blade -- but the impact LOOSENS the knife even more and Anton
winces with pain as the knife's base WOBBLES in his stump.

He grabs Molly's wrist in his good hand and holds it still.

MICK
Anton?

ANTON
Up here!

They look up at the high dive.

ANTON
(grappling with Molly)
You guys have got to turn that Freeze-
Whiz back on! It's the only way to
beat Satan.

The guys eye the machine. The skeletal hand guards it like a
pitbull.

MICK
Sure thing, buddy.

As the three guys march toward the hand, the horde of
costumed students enter the pool room.

BOYFRIEND
That's the kid whose head I punched
off!

The guys close in on the hand and Jimmy lets go of his head -
to lunge at it.

The hand smacks Jimmy's hands away, jostling his head.
Jimmy's head flies off his neck and rolls close enough to
CATCH THE HAND in his TEETH.
99

MICK
Yeah, fuck it up, Jimmy. Bite it
again!

But as Jimmy opens up to bite again, the hand CRAWLS INSIDE
HIS MOUTH and OUT the bottom where his throat should be. The
hand grabs Jimmy's head by the hair and TOSSES it into the
pool.

PNUB
Don't worry, man. I'll get you!
Mick, you cover the hand! —

Pnub grabs a long pole with a net on the end to fish Jimmy's
head out of the pool as Mick dives at the skeletal hand.

ON THE HIGH DIVE

Still on his back, Anton holds Molly's cross-jabbing wrist
with his one good hand as she leans over him.

ANTON
Molly, I can't defend myself without
hurting you! You have to clear your
mind. If you resist, Satan'll show
up and we can beat him!

He brings his pleading face up close to hers. She squirms,
trying to wrench her wrist from his grasp.

ANTON
You can do it, Molly.

She snarls evilly at him.

ANTON
Please. For me.

He kisses her softly on the lips. Suddenly, her eyes fill
with tears.

Anton lets go and watches, holding his breath as . . . Molly
convulses, struggling with herself. Her hand, holding the
cross, starts to move toward Anton, but Molly flights to hold
it back.

Summoning all her strength, she forces her fingers to LET GO
of the cross. It clatters onto the diving board and she
collapses on top of Anton.
100

ANTON
(hugging her)
Yes! I knew you'd come through, Molly!

A split-second later, Satan appears on the high dive,
blocking their way to the ladder.

SATAN
You big, fat, fucking idiot, Anton.

BELOW

The costumed students stare up at Satan in amazement and
fear. Pnub continues trying to fish Jimmy's head out of the
pool, but it keeps bobbing away. Mick has his hands full
fighting the skeletal hand.

ON THE HIGH DIVE

Grimacing in pain, Anton uses his good hand to keep the base
of his knife pressed into his stump, trying to stop it from
wobbling around as he points it defensively at Satan.

SATAN
What's the big plan? You're gonna
make me cold?

ANTON
(nervous but defiant)
That's right.

He starts to sit up, but Satan plants a massive foot on
Anton's chest, forcing him to lie back down.

SATAN
Even if your stupid friends manage
to turn that thing on, you think
I'll be helpless?
BELOW
The girl tugs on her boyfriend's arn.

GIRL
Let's go.

The boyfriend nods and they start toward the door. The rest
of the kids follow.
101

SATAN
You can't imagine the extent of
my power. All I.have to do is
point my finger, and BAM! Fire!

Satan points his finger and BAM! A wall of fire appears at
the door, blocking it from the girl and her boyfriend. They
jump back and, in a panic, the whole crowd rushes for the
door to the hallway.

Laughing, Satan points his finger again, and the hall door is
consumed in fire.

SATAN
Nobody leaves!

ANTON
(holding Molly close) .
We've already won. We resisted you.

SATAN .

Yeah, congrats. Guess what you win,
a brand-new fiery death! You two'll
burn along with everyone else here
tonight.

(to the crowd)
You can all thank Anton for your
early demise.

(to Anton)
If you hadn't been so much fun to
fuck with, I'd've moved on to some
other town long ago.

Satan laughs as the entire student body glares at Anton.

GUY IN CROWD
Nice goin' Anton.

GIRL IN CROWD
Thanks a lot.
ACROSS THE ROOM
Mick forces the hand to the ground and STEPS ON IT. He grins
as he hears each bony finger BREAK. He holds the bent,
gnarled thing up with satisfaction and...
MICK

(turning the Freeze-Whiz on)
Anton, your gizmo's back on!
102
The Freeze-Whiz ROARS to life once again. On the high dive,
Anton cranes his neck to see, giving Mick a quick thumbs-up.
ANTON
Yes!
(narrowing. his eyes at Satan)
Now you're done for.
Satan rolls his eyes as the crowd CHEERS.
Pnub finally scoops Jimmy's head into the net, but as he
turns with it, the end of the pole smacks into the Freeze-
Whiz, KNOCKING the machine into a corner of the POOL.
SATAN
(laughing his ass off)
That's just perfect!

Anton sadly watches the Freeze-Whiz sink to the bottom of the
pool...

- +» . but he also notices something else: the water around
the machine starts to FREEZE!

ANTON
(to Satan)
Laugh it up, Fucko!
He grabs Satan by the ankles and plants his foot firmly in
the Devil's crotch. In one swift movement, he heaves Satan
over’ himself and Molly, and OFF THE END OF THE DIVING BOARD.
The crowd CHEERS again, but Satan just LAUGHS as he plummets.

In the pool, ICE is SPREADING rapidly out from the Freeze-
Whiz, heading toward the middle of the pool.

In mid-fall, Satan extends his TONGUE upward, WRAPPING IT
around ANTON'S THROAT and YANKING HIM OVER THE EDGE TOO.

The crowd GASPS.
MOLLY
(screaming)
Anton!

Anton falls through the air, just seconds behind Satan.
Fach, Up, fatan laughs -- as best he can ae tHe teRgue
Stic hag out -- as Anton struggles, tugging tongue
aroun his throat.
SPLASH! Satan hits the pool.

The water instantly FREEZES SOLID OVER HIM.
Avo

A split-second later, Anton SLAMS AGAINST THE HARD ICE with a
bone-shattering smack. His knife, knocked completely out of
his stump by the impact, goes spinning across the ice.

Anton doesn't move.

MICK
Oh, shit.

MOLLY
(scrambling down the ladder)
Anton! Oh my god, Anton!

JIMMY
Is he dead?

The crowd stares in silent horror as Mick, Pnub, and Jimmy
slide across the ice toward their buddy .. .

but before they can reach Anton, the. boys' bodies COLLAPSE.
Three transparent SOULS RISE from the corpses.

MICK'S SOUL
(to Pnub)
Nice move, dickhead. I think you
just avenged our deaths.

The three boys' spirits VANISH as Molly rushes frantically
across the frozen pool. She frees Anton's throat from
Satan's tongue and kisses him.

He doesn't move.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

COPS swarm the parking lot, questioning students. The door
to the pool room is roped of with yellow crime scene tape.

Captain Tidwell surveys the scene, passing a young COP taking
notes as the girl and her boyfriend relate last night's
events ...

BOYFRIEND
- - + and Satan just starts laughing.
So then my man says “Laugh it up,
Fucko" and he grabs Satan by the. . .

Captain Tidwell passes Anton's knife, bagged and tagged on a
nearby table with bits of stump-gore clinging to it. He
steps over the yellow tape and into the pool room.
104

INT. POOL .ROOM --SAME

A bunch of COPS are hard at work. The Freeze-whiz , now
unplugged, still rests at the bottom of the pool, but the
water is once again liquid. Satan is nowhere to be seen. -

A SERGEANT looks up from dusting the Freeze-Whiz's plug for
fingerprints.

SERGEANT
Sir, I can't. find any prints of that
skeletal hand everyone keeps talking
about. Most of the prints belong to
that kid, Anton.

CAPTAIN TIDWELL

(muttering to himself)
Skeletal hand, Satan...

(to Sergeant)
I want the contents of that punch
bowl analyzed for LSD immediately.
I have a pretty good idea what
happened here.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM ~ DAY

Molly and a DOCTOR stand over Anton's bed. Anton's in a full
body cast. His eyes are open but unmoving, STARING at a
point beyond the Doctor.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Molly, but it doesn't look good.
Your boyfriend sustained serious
brain damage.

MOLLY
Can he hear me?

DOCTOR
Doubtful. And if he could, we'd
never know. He's paralyzed from
the forehead down

MOLLY
(touching Anton's forehead
sadly)
I can't believe it.

DOCTOR
(putting a consoling arm
around her)
We're doing all we can.
io

The Doctor ushers Molly from the room, revealing the point
where Anton is staring: a TV hanging from the ceiling.

ANTON'S POV: F-Troop is on.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - SAME

The Doctor leads Molly down the hall. An orderly wheels a
cart of surgical tools past them.

MOLLY
Is there any chance he'll recover?

DOCTOR
(gently)

I wouldn't get my hopes up.
Seemingly without her knowledge, Molly's hand reaches out and
pilfers an EXTREMELY SHARP SCALPEL.from the cart. She holds
it behind her back.

MOLLY

I appreciate you cutting to the truth,

Doctor.
INT. ANTON'S HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME
A NURSE enters the room. She looks at F-Troop on the TV and
then back at Anton. She waves a hand in front of Anton's
face. He doesn't blink.
The Nurse shrugs and SNAPS OFF THE Tv.
CLOSE ON Anton's horrified eyes.

: ANTON (VO)
Fucking figures.

FADE OUT
