through the story on his bo ‘gan.

MAGDA is an immaculately attired career woman in her

A SERIES OF CU’S of the funeral) service ... the
MOURNERS ... the PRIEST ... the funeral director pressing
the button, the coffin tower genre the grave ...

We also see a shabbily s&iGed man in bis late-thirtias
loitering near the MOURWERS. They seen irritated by his
presence. He approaches a WEEPING WOMAN and talks to her
quietly, handing her a business card. Her HUSBAND pushes
the man away ... he approaches another MOURKER, but meets
an equally hostile reception. The man finally beata an
undignified retreat across the graveyard towards his

We have just seen FRANK BANNISTER attempting to hustle up

line ...

INT/EXT. FRANK'S CAR/ROAD - DAY

A bunch of his business cards slide off the front seat
onto the floor.

FRANK glances down, cursing.
.--A HUGE TRUCK looms into view!

FRANK gasps and pulls on the wheel. In a blur of movement
and a squeal. of tires, his car does a one-eighty
degree spin. A collision seems inevitable ... FRANK shuts
his eyes!

Somehow FRANK'S CAR misses the TRUCK by inches ... it
Slews to a stop on a grassy lawn.

EXT. LYNSKEY HOUSE - DAY
FRANK is still gripping the wheel with white knuckles as

he slowly opens his eyes and focuses on the great lump of
hedge lodged on the hood of his car. He groans.

FRANK

RAY LYNSKEY comes running oure & ae n house ... from his
designer sportswear and well med physique it’s clear
that this guy is into physical fitness in a big way. He
looks at Prank‘’s car in disbelief.

RAY (CONT'D)
I don’t believe this! This is not
happening!

RAY stares at the two deep grooves that have been sliced
into the lawn by FRANK’S tires.

!
mI. My lawn ... wee, destroyed «

FRANK climbs out of his car ... he offers his card to
RAY.

FRANK
I’m sorry ... I’1]1 pay for any
damages ...
RAY shakes a fist at FRANK.
RAY
I swear to God, I’m gonna sue your
ass!

RAY rips the card in two.

RAY (CONT'D)

FRANK quietly slides back into his car and starts
reversing across the lawn.

RAY (CONT'D)

- (yelling)
It‘s gonna cost. you, buddy! I

RAY waves his arm at the gaping hole torn in his hedge.

RAY (CONT‘D ate

FRANK continues raversing onto the road. RAY snatches
up a headless lawn dwarf from the ramains of the hedge.

RAY (COKT‘D)

FRANK disappears down the road.

PATRICIA averts her eyes.

OLD LADY BARTLETT

With surprising strength, OLD LADY BARTLETT takee hold of
Lucy’S forearm and steers her towards the front door.

OLD LADY BARTLETT thrusts LUCY out onto the front porch,
shoving her coat and bag at her.

OLD LADY BARTLETT
You don’t know who my daughter is

LUCY looks at OLD LADY BARTLETT with an air of defiance.

Lucy
Yes ... I do, Mrs Bartlett.

OLD LADY BARTLETT
It’s not true what they say about

INT.: LYNSKEY BEDROOM - NIGHT

RAY is working his rowing machine on the bedroom floor,
wearing nothing but his boxer shorts ... LUCY is sitting
in bed reading a tacky looking book called "Killer
Couples", the cover of which features Bonnie & Clyde,
Parker.& Hulme and Leopold & Loeb.

RAY
Lucy! She killed twelve people!

LUCY looks up from the book.

The BEDCLOTHES starts to rotate ... they suddenly shoot
across the room, slamming into the wall. RAY grabs LUCY
and pulls her to the floor as the BZDCLOTHES zoom over
their heads, darting around tne room like a trapped fly.

They suddenly lose power and drop onto RAY and LuUcY’SsS
huddled figures.

RAY

localized air current ...

LUCY jumps to her feet, throwing the bedclothes away. She
backs away from thes, rigid with fear ... collapsing on
the bed.

EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Looking down on FAIRWATER at 3em ... There’s not a lot
happening.

CRANE DOWN ... to reveal FRANK’S HOUSE perched high on a
bluff above the town. In the moonlight we can make out
little detail ... but it is obvious that the house is
only half built.

HEADLIGHTS approach up the winding road, and FRANK polls :
into his drive.

He hops out of his car and goes to the back, opening the
trunk

SUDDENLY! ... A GHOULISH EMANATION rushes out of the
truck! FRAKK leaps to one side ...

ANOTHER EMARATION lurches out! .
FRANK slams the trunk.

The first apparition - STUART HARPER, staggers cover to 4
low wall and sits down clutching his stomach.
STUART
I think I’m gonna throw up!

STUART was in. his early twenties when he died. He has a
slightly retten appearance and continually dribbles with
ectoplasmic slime. We can see through him, although the
degree of translucence is not always consistent ...
STUART had a double degree in art history and theology.

CYRUS is the other apparition. He is a black dude from
the seventies ... White disco suit, built up heels and
sideburns.

CYRUS
Man, I hate that trunk!

FRANK
I’m not having you spreading
your ectoplasmic muck over ny
seats.

~ STUART

STUART reaches into his pockets and angrily flings a pile
of Frank's business cards onto the driveway.

. STUART
I quit!

FRANK is not buying into any of this ...
Rt.
FRANK
Shut up!

FRANK gives STUART an angry shove ... He wobbles on his
feet, losing his tenuous center of gravity. EMANATIONS
are made up of loosely compacted particles that can be
distorted, scattered, stretched and squeezed - always
returning to their original shape.

FRANK (CONT’D)
(angry)
You clowns left se high and dry
, tonight! I arrive at the house and
‘ there’s nothing happening ... You
guys are just sitting around
watching. I couldn’t believe it!
STUART
We actually strained our backs,
lifting the bed, Frank!

FRANK
Come on! You could’ve swung some
cupboards arourd ... flashed a few
lights! How hard is that? I’ve
gotta have something to work with!

FRANK fishes his keys out of his pocket and enters his
house ... CYRUS jives in behind FRANK.

STUART staggers to his feet.

STUART
- Prank] I didn’t go to college to
spend the rest of my life haunting
people!

FRANK closes the front door in STUART‘’S face ... The
Emanation momentarily flattens against te door, then
passes straight through it! nn

We can see FRANK'S HOUSE more clearly now ... It is only
half finished: Large sections bave not been clad. A
whole wing of the house consists of nothing but
framework. Protective tarpaulins flap in the wind. Stacks
of bricks and timber litter the section. An old concrete
mixer is parked st the top of the drive.

None of this would be unusual ... if it wasn’t for the
fact that the construction clearly stopped some ten
years earlier... Everything is badly weathered, rusty snd
weeds grow out of control] admist the halt completed
house. yy

BANG! BANG! Loud gunshets echo out of the house.

FRANK is humming to himself in a hot shower ~ steam fills
the shower stall as he lets the water cascade over his
head and shoulders.

INT. FRANK’S SHOWER - MORNING

The water pressure suddenly dies. FRANK frowns and
&djusts the nozzle ...

The pipe bulges and CYRUS balloons out of the shower
head! His head and shoulders are terribly distorted.

cyrus
It’s the Judge, Frank ... the
cat‘s real upset man! He’s got his
wix shooters out!

BANGL BANG! More gunshots.

CYRUS disappears back into the pipe ... before he can
react, FRANK gets a face full of scolding water.

FRANK
aggh!

INT. FRANK‘’S KITCHEN - HORNING
FRANK storms into the kitchen ...

He is confronted with the sight of. the JUDGE ... a tall
elderly Emanation - a lawman from the last days of the
nineteenth century. The JUDGE was embalmed, but it was a
cheap job and hasn‘t stood the test of time. His dry
mummified body is in an advanced state of decay ... He
looks even worse without his jaw bone!

The JUDGE is swivelling around, blazing away wildly with
two rusty ghost Colts. FRANK flinches as ghost bullets
pass through his body and the wall behind without leaving

a mark. CYRUS and STUART peer warily out of framed
paintings.
JUDGE
(gurgle)

Damn rustler’s took me jaw bone!

A mangy transparent GHOST DOG is racing around the room,
circling the JUDGE at high speed ... the o jaw bone
clenched between his teeth!!!

FRANK drops to his knees, attempting wit the dog.

Rustler! Here boy! ce

RUSTLER ignores FRANK and keeps racing around the roon.
BANG! BANG! The JUDGE takes potshots at RUSTLER. A ghost
bullet ricochets past STUART’S ear, taking a nick out of
it. Ectoplasm dribbles between his fingers.

STUART
For Godsake, Frank! I could’ve
met. been killed!

FRANK takes a flying leap at RUSTLER, bringing him down
in a tackle. He tugs the ghostly jaw bone out of the
DOG’S mouth.

FRANK
Put your shooters away, Judge!

THE JUDGE snatches his jaw bone out of FRANK’S hand and
Fans it back into his face.

JUDGE
(flexing jaw)
‘Sneaky little sidewinder! 1/11
have the varmint stuffed!

RUSTLER playfully licks THE JUDGE’S hand with a wet,
rotten tongue.

INT. FRANK’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

Like the exterior, the inside of FRANK’S house has also
been left unfinished for many years. Very few of the
walls and ceilings have been lined - timber framing is
visible throughout. No painting has been done and
makeshift furniture is scetteread about.

FRANK is quietly hunched over a newspaper in the gloomy
lounge. THE JUDGE sits in a large old armchair ... He
enite a soft glow in the semi~darkness.

JUDGE
Prank ... When 3s man’s jaw drops
off, it’s time to reassess the
situation.

FRANK looks at THE JUDGE with concern.

FRANK

FRANK

THE JUDGE chuckles softly.
JODGE
You ain’t touched this place in
ten years, Frank, If I wait around
for- you, I/11 never get to rest in
peace ... Prank?

FRANK is searching the peper, quickly turning the pages,
scanning his eyes up and down the columns.

‘CUT TO:
EXT. STREET/NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

FRANK angrily slams the door as he storms out of the
Newspaper office. He marches across the road, causing a
hearse to slam on the brakes ... the coffin slides around
in the back! Various cars in the funeral entourage blast
their horns at FRANK‘S reckless jaywalking.

FRANK does a double take as he notices LUCY LYNSKEY
sitting in the back of one of the ait.

FRANK reaches the other side @ road ... he hears the
sound of running feet: RAY SKEY is running down the
sidewalk straight towar im!

RAY is pale and frightened. -

RAY runs straight through other pedestrians! He is
transparent! Nobody seems aware of his presence. He
approaches FRANK at breakneck speed. FRANK shies back,
but too late...

WHACK! .RAY thumps straight into FRANK and both men fall
over. A COUPLE OF PASSERSBY help FRANK to his feet. RAY
stays on the ground looking at FRANK with disbelief.

Tears well in RAY‘'S eyes.

FRANK (CONT'D)
In a year’s time, on the
anniversary of your death, you
will have another chance to cross
to the other side - to become a
pure spirit. Until then you're

authoritarian voice suddenly barks out ...

horror as the mummy’s head slowly turns towards him!

A bead of sweat rolls down the CURATOR’S forehead ... the
pummy’s thin, desiccated lips tighten into a ghoulish

The CURATOR looks fearfully at Frank’s card again, stuffs
one in his pocket and quickly discards the others before

FRANK breaks out into a sweat. THE REAPER rises and turns
to FRANK ... He averts his eyes, clearly not wanting THE
REAPER to realise he is visible to FRANK.

movement, THE REAPER produces a long wooden’ staff
from beneath his cloak ... he thumps the basa on the

and locks inte place with a metallic click. The blade
shimmers with an ethereal glow ... THE REAPER has his

Nina Kulagina used her mind power
to stop the beat of a frogs heart.
The record of this experiment is
in the forn of a cardiogran
currently held in the files of
Professor Genady Sergeyev in
Leningrad. As Sergeyev interpreted
the cardiogram, the heart seemed
to experience a sudden flare-up of
electrical activity ... the heart
imploded, the arteries burst ...
all because Nina Kulagina wanted
the animal dead.

FRANK slowly looks up at DAMMERS ...
