Dad? Can you explain again what

we're doing?

We're kicking off our fun, old-

He whips around. His two boys whip around and look out

The semi returns to the proper lane. There's no Taurus.
EXT. PICKUP - CLOSEUP - BACK WINDOW 31
The two boys exchange bewildered looks.

EXT. HIGHWAY - SEMI 32
The Taurus is trapped between the front and back wheels

of the high-clearance trailer running at high-speed. Mud
and road salt from the front trailer wheels is peppering
the car.

INT. TAURUS 33
The family's silent with shock. Clark's in a full sweat

as he struggles to maintain the exact speed of the truck
to avoid being caught in the rear wheels.

CLARK
We're alright! ‘Thank God, we're
alright!

ELLEN

Clark? We're stuck under a truck.

CLARK
Do you honestly think I don't know

Just ahead, a snow plough is pulled over on the shoulder,
directly in line with the on-coming Taurus.

43 EXT. ROAD 43
The Taurus hurtles off the road and disappears. It's
silent.

Peace and tranquility. A virgin snowfield. a long beat
and the Taurus bursts out of snowbank INTO CAMERA.

Oo 45 EXT. ROAD 45

The Taurus returns to the road, crossing the left lane,
then the right and off the road.

46 EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE FARM 46

A large, permanent wood sign festooned with colored
lights reads -- JOLLY JERRY'S SAW 'N' SAVE CHRISTMAS
TREE RANCH. The Taurus blasts past the sign and into a
make-shift parking lot, sliding sideways into a parking
space.

: 47 INT. CAR 47

The family is frozen in horror. Clark puts the Taurus in
park and turns OFF the ENGINE. He looks at his watch.

CLARK
Hey! We made pretty good time.

48 EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE FARM 48

Families stumble across the frozen earth between the rows ,
of fir trees, shivering, cursing, grousing. We FIND

Is this air fresh or what? Take a
deep breath! Notice that smell?

RUSTY
It smells like Pinesol.

CLARK
And isn’t that a Christmasy smell?

ELLEN
Clark, can we pick out a tree
while we smell? It's awfully cold.

AUDREY
My toes are numb.

Ellen points out a tree.

ELLEN
There's a nice one over there.

Clark considers the tree briefly and rejects it.

CLARK
The bottom's all dead, hon. A
deer probably lifted his leg on it.

They continue their march through the snow.

RUSTY
Dad? Didn't they invent Christmas
tree lots so people wouldn't have
to drive all the way out to nowhere
and waste a whole Saturday?

CLARK

They invented them, Russ, because
people forgot how to have a fun,
old-fashioned family Christmas and
are satisfied with scrawny, dead,
over-priced trees that have no
special meaning. You know, kids.
This is what our forefathers did.

AUDREY
I can't feel my legs.

CLARK
They went out in the woods, picked
out that special tree and cut it
down with their bare hands.

and the kids. They're also blue. We continue to WIDEN

roof. The car pulls ahead and OVERTAKES CAMERA. We
see the full length of the tree; branches bound with
heavy twine and a huge root ball.

A fine upper middle class dwelling. The lights are on.
The Taurus's in the driveway. The giant tree is resting
on its rootball in the front yard. Rusty and a couple
of neighbor kids are standing in the driveway looking
at the tree. Inside the garage, a CHAINSAW STARTS UP.

CHRISTMAS VACATION - Rev. 4/19/89 14.
EXT. HOUSE NEXT DOOR 55

A couple in their mid-thirties is getting out of a Saab
parked in the driveway of the house next to the
Griswolds.

They're handsome, successful, modern suburban profession-
als. MARGO and TODD CHESTER. They look to the Griswolds,
wincing at the ROAR of the CHAINSAW. Margo crosses
around to Todd to stand at his side.

TODD
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his living room
ceiling.

They have a chuckle -- a compressed, stiff laugh. They
are clearly people devoid of humor.

THEIR POV
The giant tree is laying in the front yard, still bound

with twine. Clark takes the chainsaw to it and cuts it in
half.

The tree is up in the rear corner of the room. Clark's
had to trim both the top and bottom to get it to fit.

It's still wrapped with twine. The family is standing
before the tree.

Clark? Is there enough room for

more trimming to do but it won't
be a problem.

Clark steps to the tree and takes up a length of twine.
CLARK

A third of the living room square footage is dominated
by the unfurled tree. The Griswolds stand waist-deep
in pine boughs. The tree is the same diameter at

the top as at the bottom. It's a pine cylinder, eight
feet in diameter. Clark looks at Ellen, Audrey and
Rusty. He says nothing. They say nothing.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 60

The lights are on. We can see the glow of a fire in the
living room fireplace.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSEUP - FIREPLACE - LATER 61

A beautiful fire. CHRISTMAS MUSIC is playing on the
STEREO.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It's pleasant and calm. A nearly perfect holiday
picture. Clark's wearing a cashmere V-neck. He's un-
tangling a strand of lights. Audrey, Rusty and Ellen are
sitting with bowls of popcorn and cranberries in their
laps. Clark has trimmed the Christmas tree branches and
denuded the top twelve inches to accommodate the star.
He's fishing lights out of a cardboard box.

RUSTY :
I can't get my needle through the
cranberries.

AUDREY

The popcorn falls apart when I
pull the string through it!

Clark walks to the tree with the light strands.

You know, kids, years ago, people
couldn't go out and buy their
ornaments. They had to make them
from things around the old prairie
homestead. Colored balls of mud,
wood shavings, bits of yarn and
string, ox horns, donkey tails,
prairie dog whiskers. I'll get
the lights up and then I'll give
you a hand.

Clark begins stringing the lights on the tree, starting
at the bottom. Clark moves slowly around the tree,
stringing the lights as he goes.

CLOSEUP - RUSTY
He reaches into a bowl of popcorn.
RUSTY

Dad? This tradition stuff is
pretty cool so far but I think it
might lose its charm if it
extended to our gifts. I mean,
you're not planning on making
our presents are you?

He loads the popcorn into his mouth.

Clark pulls a large wad of sticky pine needles off the
cuff of his sweater and tries to flick it into the
wastebasket.

ELLEN
Let's not forget whose idea it
was to have the fun, old-fashioned
family Christmas here.

CLARK
Am I complaining?

Ellen is trying to get the needles off her hands. All
She does is transfer the needles from one hand to the
other. They continue talking, not acknowledging the sap
and the needles.

ELLEN
No, but I think you're forgetting
how difficult it's going to be
with all these people at our
house.

CLARK
They're family, Ellen, not
strangers off the street.

ELLEN
They're family and they don't get
along.

You want to hurry up with this,

Clark gives Art a sidelong glance. He refuses to let

He sets down the bag of gifts. He takes out a gift and

gift-wrapped package. He reaches back around, stretches,
grits his teeth as he reaches far behind the chimney.

Oh, my gosh! Her eyes aren't

Quit being so damn polite, Ed.

You want to spend the holidays

with four people jammed toe-to-

Eddie reevaluates his position.

EDDIE
Catherine and me are comfy in
there. Maybe you folks wouldn't
mind the youngsters shacking up
with you. After that drive...

We could use some time together.

Honey, run and get the kids'

EDDIE
Snots! Get outta there! Go to

The dog saunters out of the living room.

EDDIE
Cute, isn't he? Only problem is,
he's got a little Mississippi leg
hound in him. If the mood catches
him right, he'll grab your leg and
go to town. You don't want him
around if you're wearing short
pants, if you know what I mean.
A word of warning, though. If he
does start on you, you best let
him finish.

CLARK
(changes the subject)
I just can't believe you're
actually standing here in my living
room. I never thought the day
would come.

EDDIE
I'm excited about it, too. It's a
cryin' shame the older kids
couldn't make it. I got the

conventional fork, all of which she is oblivious to.

He tears open the envelope slowly and deliberately,
teasing himself and the others. He brings the envelope
to his lips and blows, inflating it. With great flair,
he reaches two fingers into the envelope and snares its
contents. He withdraws a green slip of paper. He waves
it in the air.

If there's enough left over, I'll
fly you all in to help us dedicate

Thank God, you're alright!

I'm fine. I'm just fine. There's
been a big misunderstanding
tonight.

OFFICER
Excuse me, would you and Mrs.
Shirley like to step outside while
we take care of business here?

FRANK
There's no business. I'm not
pressing any charges.

HELEN
What?

FRANK
It was a mistake.

HELEN
Frank, you were kidnapped.

FRANK
I did something I shouldn't have
and these people called me on it.
This is Clark Griswold and his

family.

ELLEN
Welcome to our home. What's left
of it.

Helen is completely baffled.

HELEN
What is going on here?

FRANK
Remember how I was toying with the
notion of suspending Christmas

HELEN
You didn't...

I changed my mind. I'm
