INT. WLLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 1

As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American
high school...

ANOTHER CORRI DOR 1A

...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the
unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music.

INT. WLLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 1B

The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light
from an open door...

MATT (0. S.)
This is unwatchable. It's not even in
focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is
in the shot. This is really shoddy work.
INT. WLLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY 10

The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a
TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.

DEACON (0.S.)
Why do they always show the guy's face?
It's like, can't we just assume he's
enjoying it?

We slowly PULL BACK fromthe TV.

FRED (0.8.

It's a basic rule of porno.

Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON.

They're watching the porno...

DEACON (V. 0.)
It all started on my seventeenth birthday
with our usual morning routine: film
appreciation.

The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.

FRED
Deacon! What are you doing? | was
watching that.

DEACON

Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's.
The original plus four copies pop out.

CLOSE ON the original tape: "Ramalot Productions presents
Dirty Darla #7," as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to
Deacon. They smile.

INT. WLLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
The guys are waiting in line for lunch.
DEACON (V.0.)
Fred's the kind of kid who's basically

given up on high school. He figures his
glory days are way ahead of him.

FRED
First, | go to Yale, then Harvard | aw,
then when I'm making a hundred grand a
year, I'll have a whole stable of hot
chicks sitting around topless on my
yacht.

He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.

MATT

Deacon and Matt walk off. Fred calls after them.

He puts his book bag down, then pi aces a protector on the

paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred

pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles.

NT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 6

Fred is walking to class when he spots _a HOT GIRL, rubbing a

INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOMS - DAY 10

Matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to
his bloody nose.

DEACON (V.0.)
In the normal course of Unings, Mat t
probably wouldn't even have been our
riend, but Fred likes having someone to
boss around, and | think Matt's actually
pretty cool once you get to know him.

Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWM TEAM COACH comes out of the
girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and
the door to the locker roomcloses slowly.

Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK,
a sliver of daylight still visible.

Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the

boys' locker room Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too
immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be.
He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He
turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.

MATT'S POV 10A

The proverbial jackpot. Teenage girls changing. Bras.
Panties. Towels...

REVERSE ANGLE 10B

Matt's eyes widen. And then, they CLOSE TIGHT. He quickly
scurries away.
