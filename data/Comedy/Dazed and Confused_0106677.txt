FADE IN:
OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE

Behind logos and title cards we hear the eerie and edgy beginning
of Aerosmith’s “Sweet Emotion“. The citles are offset by random
high school yearbook photos of members of the cast. Some are
their official school pictures with their activity listings.
while others are che students in various extracurricular activity
poses. The last title reads:

LAST DAY OF SCHOOL MAY 28, 1976 12:55 p.m.

SERIES OF SHOTS

As the song kicks in we SEE many of these same characters in
their lunch-time environment.

EXT: HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

The convertible parks next to a crowded, smoke-filled car with
the windows rolled up. KEITH PICKFORD and MICHELLE BURROUGHS
soon hop out of this car and head toward the school. Standing
next co his truck, RANDY “PINK* FLOYD calls out co them.

PINK
Pickford! You stoner!

Pickford acknowledges him with a slightly sarcastic, mimicking
voice as he and Michelle walk over to him.

PICKFORD
They say it'll kill ya but they
don't say when...

PINK
. How's it lookin’ for tonight?

PICKFORD
Three kegs...

PINK

Cool. But the big news is... Check
this shit: out.

Pink grabs a tarp in the bed of his truck and with one quick
motion, jerks away the canvas and reveals a smiling Ronald
McDonald statue. Formerly of the drive-thru line, Ronald has a
speaker in his stomach.

PICKFORD
Awwright...

MICHELLE
Cool.

PINK
Me and Dollar nabbed it about four-
thirty this morning. We just went
through there for lunch... They got
this old lady standing out there
taking orders by hand.

He imitates a little old lady scribbling on a note pad.
PINK
(continuing)
Did you want fries with that? The
thing’s three feet away from her.

They laugh a bit and walk together up the stairs to the school.
INT: HALLWAY - DAY
Pickford, Michelle, and Pink walk down the hall.
PICKFORD
Can't believe we gotta be here ac
all today...

MICHELLE
Let the torture begin...

They pass PAUL SLATER near a water fountain.

PICKFORD
Slater, son...
PINK
How's it going?
. SLATER -
It's fixin’ to be going A LOT

better...

Slater pops somaching in his mouth and takes a quick gulp at the
fountain. He then offers up his hand and Pickford “gives him
five* in the slowest, coolest way possible.

SLATER»
So what time tonight?

: PICKFORD
‘Bout nine or ten...

SLATER
All right.

Slater walks away while Pickford, Michelle, and Pink walk near
Pink’s classroom door.

PINK
Later...

PICKFORD
See you up there after...

As Pickford walks away, he acknowledges TONY OLSON and MIKE
NEWHOUSE standing in the hall near the door to Pink's classroom.

PICKFORD .
If it isn’t Woodward and Bernstein.

Tony and Mike just smirk at Pickford as Pink slows down near the
door. :

: PINK
Men.

(CONTINUED)
2. CONTINUED:

MIKE
So was this a smoked or liquid
lunch?
: : . lack
Pink points at him like ‘yeah right’ as a friend and'classmate of
theirs, ROYCE CRAWFORD, pokes his head out of the door.

ROYCE -
Poker game still on for tonight?
PINK .

I don‘c know about tonight for

me...
MIKE
\ I chought we should all go out.

TONY
And do what?

PINK .
I‘m probably going to Pickford’s
party.

~~ MIKE

Exactly - we should do something
like that. We can play poker any
time.

. ROYCE .

I don‘t know, sounds suspect.
we'll have to put it up before the
committee.

Royce and Pink head into the room while Tony suddenly remembers
something he wants to tell Mike and gestures for him to walk with
him-down the hall a bit.

‘TONY
Okay, I had this dream last
night...
(grins quizzically)
Okay, you have to promise not to

tell ANYONE.
‘ MIKE
Sure.
TONY
Say I promise.
MIKE

Tony gets a liccle quieter and makes sure no one is listening.

TONY
~ Okay... In this dream I was having
sex with what had a perfect female
body but...

MIKE
But what? What?

Tony changes his mind.

TONY
I can‘t say...

MIKE
Oh come on, you can't give a build-~
up like chat and then not deliver.
Okay, 30, a beautiful female body,
we're off to a good start...

He gestures for Tony to continue.

TONY
But the head of... -Abraham Lincoln.
MIKE doesn’t really react at all.

MIKE

TONY
The hat, beard...
(changing subject)
Oh well, best not think too deeply
about this one...

. MIKE
Best not...

TONY
I gotta go see Mr. Lane. I’11 be
back after a while...

Tony walks off as Mike heads into the classroom.

INT: NEWSPAPER STAFF CLASSROOM

Later, inside the newspaper class, Pink, Royce, JODI KERR, KAYE
EAULENER. SHAVONNE RHODES, and CYNTHIA DUNN are deep in
iscussion.

ROYCE
...Did we already say the one where
Shac big game hunter arrives on the
" island and decides cto hunt
Gilligan?

JODI
No... That's 27...

SHAVONNE
What about the time cthae rock
group, ‘The Mosquitos" visits the
asland and Ginger and Mari Ann form
their own group.

PINK
. That's 28.
KAYE
That‘s got to be about all of
them... Didn’et they only make two
season's worth of that show?
CYNTHIA

Mrs. Howell was also in that group.
Tony walks in and the entire class dies laughing.

Ab ROYCE

Tony flashes a quick glance toward Mike, who's acting like
nothing happened.

. PINK .

Honest Abe... read us a Gettysburg
address, Mister, or is it Misses?
Lincoln,

Amid continuing laughter, Tony quickly gains his composure and
calmly motions to the class to quiet down and listen.

TONY
It's MISTER EDITOR to all of you
for the next year... you bunch of
mundane feeble wits.

He then sits down right in front of Mike and glares at him.

TONY
Death...

MIKE
I was very specific, I promised not
to tell anyONE. I told EVERYone.

From che hallway, DON DOLLAR looks in the room, makes sure the
teacher isn’t there and chen gestures to Pink in the back of the
class.

. DON
Hey Pink! You ready?

Pink walks over to the door.

PINK
I can’t go yet. As soon as Mrs.
Wilk gets here and checks roll we
can probably all split. Go get
penny and check me out on the way
ack.

‘ DON
Cool...

Don walks away down the hall.

INT: SHOP CLASS - DAY

Don looks into the shop clas&$ and gestures to BENNY McCRACKEN who
is standing off to the side, putting the finishing sanding
touches on a large paddle he has made. Benny gestures for Don to
hold on for just a moment. In the back of the class, Slater and
two others, STONER #1 and STONER #2, discuss the more technical
aspects of rock and roll. On Slater’s desk is a three foot bong
he has made as his final woodworking project.

SLATER
...Man, I heard when Nugent was
playing in Miami, or maybe it was
San Francisco... Anyway, man, this
chick gets up on stage and starts
giving him a blowjob while he was
playing, man, ‘Stranglehold.*

STONER #2
(excited)
No way...

Stoner #1 gestures toward his project: a roundish, hand-carved
Led Zepplin logo.

STONER #1

Hey, last week in New Orleans...
Bonham... one-hour drum solo...

. STONER #2
Wow...

CONTINUED :

STONER #1
Hey Benny, man, I feel sorry for
those incoming freshmen.

Benny smiles and makes a gesture like he’s giving someone a
spanking with his newly sanded board. The teacher of the class,
a middle-aged bald man named MR. RIX, is laid back in his chair
fast asleep with his mouth open. On his way out the door, Benny
goes up to Mr. Rix and pops the top of a coke in his ear. As
Benny rushes out the door, Mr. Rix slowly wakes up.

MR. RIX
Get back to your seats...

INT: HALLWAY OUTSIDE SHOP CLASS - DAY

Out in che hallway, Benny proudly shows his board cto Don as they
start to walk down the hall.

BENNY
Check it out. I just drilled a
series of small holes... to cut

down on the wind resistance and
create more of a sting on impact.

In an upbeat, cocky manner, Shavonne walks by and gives a slight
smile.

DON
Hmmm... Lookin’ good Sha-Vaaan.

She walks past but Don keeps watching her. She eventually turns
into the girl's room but looks back at Don before she entars.

DON
Caught yah!

He laughs as they keep slowly walking.
DON

(continuing)
She wants my dick.

BENNY
Yeah sure... Like every other girl
.at this school. She was looking at
me, anyway.

DON
Shiiit, man, I get so much pussy...
I should be banned from this place.
BENNY
Banned for being such a pussy?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

DON
Fuuuck you man.

INT: GIRL‘S BATHROOM - DAY

Shavonne, Jodi, and Kaye are hanging out in the bathroom. Kaye
and Jodi share a cigarette while Shavonne primps in the mirror.

SHAVONNE
.,.Yeah, he acts all cocky now but
did you notice when he poked his
head in the room a little while
ago, he didn’t even look at me?
(a beac)
Forget him.

goor
Is Randy Floyd going out with
anyone right now?

SHAVONNE
I don’t think so. I don’t know about
that guy. Watch him in action -
he's like a polititian.

JODI
Just because a guy isn’t like the
Neanderthals you like. I mean, you
basically don't like any guy whose
IQ approaches triple digits.

Before Shavonne can respond, Kaye jumps in.

KAYE .
You know, this is really pathetic.
All you ever talk about is guys.
Everything is always guys - going
to watch guys do whatever it is
they're doing at the time, getting
all dressed up so maybe some guy
will notice you... Do you think
guys spend one-tenth the time we do
thinking and catering to us? Hell
no... They're too busy DOING things
besides preparation for us... What
do we DO? Sit around and plot
about them in some way or another.

SHAVONNE .

Yeah, but look at the shit they do:
playing sports, fixing up their
cars, ... It's all bullshic anyway,
who can take it serious?

(CONTINUED)
o : 10.
1 6 CONTINUED:

JODI
' We don’t have any choice BUT to
take whatever they do serious.

KAYE
Exactly.
(to Shavonne)
And there you were in class with
them trying to list all the
Gilligan's Island episodes without
even a HINT of irony. .

SHAVONNE,
What the hell are you talking
about, girl?

} . KAYE
You never thought about that show?
It's what's called a male
| . pornographic fantasy. Think about
! it... You're basically alone on an
island with two readily available
women... one a seductive, sex-
goddess type, the other a healthy,
o girl-next-door type with a nice
— butt. So, guys have it all - the
Madonna and the whore, and what do
women get? Nothing. A geek, an
over-weight middle age guy, a nerdy
scientific type... those are all
types that your typical male feels
least threatened by. So in the
male viewers mind, he puts himself
on the island and he can have it
1 all. A woman puts herself on the
island and she's bored shitless.

| : SHAVONNE

You're really full of it. First
off, you forgot Mr. and Mrs. .
Howell, and second, the audience is
probably half women, anyway.

KAYE

My point exactly. Women are taught
i to not mind being bored as long as

thay are occasionally acknowledged.

(thinking) .

And being stranded on an island

awaiting rescue is a TOTAL metaphor

for the position in which most

women are put in in this society
a _ today.

Jodi walks over to Kaye.

(CONTINUED)
1 6 CONTINUED: (2)

JODI
You know, ever since you spent
spring break with your sister at
college you've had this fucking
actcicude...

Kaye suddenly seems to realize she's gone maybe one step coo far
and pulls back a litele.

KAYE
Well excuse me for thinking abouc
j things a liccle...

JoDI
! Yeah, that’s it... stop thinking so
, | much.
| . SHAVONNE

{to Kaye) .
| : You need to get laid.

From the hall, Benny can be heard.

1 . BENNY (0.S) _
o Pink! We're off to raise hell.
~~ Let‘s go, man!

Jodi hears them and walks out.

7 INT: HALLWAY - DAY

Jodi walks out in the hall and sees Benny, Don, and Pink walking
away. She catches up to them.

JODI
\ Hey, Benny. You guys take it easy
on my little brother...

BENNY
I got room for his initials right
here.

He shows her his board and all the guys laugh a bit.

|. JODI
Just don't get him any more than
anyone else.

DON
Okay, okay, you win. Even though
Mitch is a card-carrying smartass,
_ as a personal favor to you, because
a we like you so much, we’ll take it
easy on him.

PINK

So you have our word. Little
brother will be okay.

JODI
I was just kind of worried about
him. Sounded like everyone wanted
to kill him.

PINK
Bye.

JODI
Bye. Thanks.

Jodi walks back to the others while che guys turn and continue

on.

As soon as Jodi is. far enough away not to hear chem, Don

looks up at Benny with a kind of mischievous grin on his face.

- DON
Bullshit? .

BENNY
Major bullshic! He’s a dead man.

They all laugh.

PINK
Man, this place is vacant. All the
seniors gone on their senior
trip...

BENNY
I'm glad those losers are gone.
This is what it's going to be like
all next year... US running this
place.

DON
Really...

BENNY
You guys hear-about 0’Bannion?

‘PINK
Yeah, what a dumb-shic.

On the way out the door, they pass a group of three young
Vietnamese girls. Benny does a double take.

8 EXT: HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
Benny, Don, and Pink walk up to Pink’s truck.

' . BENNY .
-..But that‘s my poinc. We're
cotally being over-run by those
Vietcong. Why don't they just stay
the hell where they were? We don't
' need ‘em.

On top of the building in the background is the departing Seniors
obligatory ‘senior prank” ~ an outhouse with ‘SRS.‘76* painted on
the side. Pink looks up at it as they begin to get in his truck.

PINK
Witty guys...

. DON
Shotgun!

| : Before Don gets in the truck, he reaches over, pulls up the tarp,
! and glances under it.

DON
How's Ronnie doin’ today?

9 EXT: ROAD TO JUNIOR HIGH - DAY

As they drive along, Pink tries to explain the Vietnam situation
to Benny without being too condescending.

PINK
..,Well maybe because our country
had something to do with fucking up
1 . where they lived and the least we
. could do was help out the ones that
got away.

DON

Now wait. The side we were
fighting for finally lost, right?

BENNY .

them. :

BENNY
We never lost no war, man.

PINK
when the communist croops swarmed
into Saigon and everybody was
running for their lives, holding on
to planes and pushing choppers into
che sea and shit, it was all over.
A defeat by any logical definition.

BENNY
Tt might not have worked out
perfectly. but I bet we killed a
ot more of chem than they killed
us, right?

Benny positions a speaker on top of Pink's truck and hits a
switch on his CB. He reaches for the mic. .

PINK

Yes... we probably killed lers more
of them than they did us.

BENNY :
That's all I'm saying.

With his board in one hand and the mic in the other, Benny
assumes a confrontational pose facing a wall of classrooms that
are all glass windows, many of which are open.

BENNY
Okay all you freshman wimps, listen
up! Any of you ever heard of Fred
O’Bannion? He was the meanest
senior last year. I would've been
the meanest senior this year except
QO'Bannion just found out he‘s going
to be a senior again this next
year. He flunked out and he’s
really pissed off about it! I feel
sorry for you guys. And because we
feel sorry for you, we're going to
take it easy on you. I£ you wait
for us after school today, you'll
only get one lick from each of us.
If you run like the cowards you
are, it's open season all summer
long. And Mitch Kerr... we're
especially looking for you! Your
ass will be purple before this day
is over!

INT: JUNIOR HIGH CLASSROOM - DAY

The room is buzzing as MITCH KERR looks out the window with a
mixture Of dread, fear and excitement. Sitting near him are his
friends TOMMY LAWSON and CARL BURNS. A few seats away are GEEK

#1 and-GEEK #2, intensely playing a juvenile folded-
foorball game. ying aj ‘up paper

CARL
You better get out of town, man.
Spend the summer with your
grandparents or something.

TOMMY
You are going to show up to our
game tonight, aren’t you?

MITCH
I'm pitching. Kind of have to.

CARL
How should we inscribe your
tombstone?

GEEK #1
How ‘bout “Bent over.”

He and Geek #2 giggle. Mitch and the other guys barely
acknowledge them.

MITCH

Yeah right, piss-ant.

(to others)
It's all because I supposedly smart-
mouthed some senior I've never met,
and because my sister is Miss
popularity... Why aren’t they
after anyone else?

. CARL
They are, man, believe me.

Across the room, a group of FRESHMAN GIRLS (#1-#4) are going over
a list of those scheduled to be picked up after school by the
senior girls. SABRINA DAVIS, a little shy but more mature
looking than the others, sits away from the group but is .
listening in somewhat. Behind her is FRESHMAN GIRL #5 who, like
Sabrina, is not in the ‘inner circle.* Freshman Girl #1 reads
aloud from the list.

They let out an almost collective moan at what awaits them but
are excited at the same time. Sitting a few desks over, BLACK
CLASSMATES #1,#2, and #3 are taking this all in.

BLACK CLASSMATE #1
Girl, you gotta be crazy to let
some big girl do that to you.

BLACK CLASSMATE #2
You white girls are funny.

BLACK CLASSMATE #3

chances of survival exponentially.

Mr. Lindsay looks up and chen assumes a new air, ready to say
something wise to the young men.

It‘s like our sergeant cold us

EXT: HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - Cay

Pink’s truck pulls up near the practice field. Several coaches
are milling about when they notice a few of their prize specimens
have arrived. COACH CLEMENTS, an older and rather stoic man is
flankéd by COACH ALPERT, who's younger, bigger, more aggressive
and playful. He approaches the guys as they get ouc of the
cruck.

COACH ALPERT :
Any of you ladies gonna be ready to
play some football this coming

all?

BENNY
I've been doing so good in my
English classes, coach, I think I'm
going to take next fall off and
. become a writer.

They all laugh.

COACH ALPERT
Boy, you couldn't write your name
if it wasn’t stenciled on your
locker.

{to all of them)
Now don't go getting soft on me
this summer... Sitting by a pool
somewhere, chasing the muff
around...

They all laugh a little as they start walking back to the school.

COACH ALPERT
Break down!

Benny automatically falls into a stance where his knees are bent,
his fists are clenched and held firmly up near his face, almost
karate-like. Don only slightly goes through such ridiculous
motions and Pink not at all.

COACH ALPERT
Hell, my grandmother's quicker and
tougher than you panty-waists...
Course she is 6'3*, 250 and runs a
4.5 forty. :

Noticing Pink's poor attitude, Coach Clements suddenly rouses a
little and points at him.

COACK CLEMENTS
Randy Floyd, before next fall,
you're in need of a serious
attitude adjustment young man.

Don and Benny glance back at the coach and then at Pink, who
keeps walking but doesn’t say anything back,

COACH CLEMENTS
Better get your priorities straight
and watch out with that other crowd
you're running with. Don’t think
we haven‘t noticed.

As soon as they are all at a safe distance and walking tsward che
school, the guys start to ride Pink a litcle.

I.told O’Bannion I’d go over there
with him and Hudson.

Benny heads off while Don and Pink enter the school.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Don and Pink walk down the hall in no particular hurry. In his
usual sogky way, Don looks into various classrooms along the way,
acknowledging those he deems worthy of recognition. As an
UNDERCLASSMAN walks by, looking a bit afraid of Don to begin
with, Don acts like he’s going to hit him. The Underclassman
reacts by covering himself up and bracing for the blow. Don
pulls his punch, of course, and leaves the Underclassman to walk
off cotally humiliated. He and Pink keep walking like noching
happened. Soon they are at the door to Pink‘s class.

PINK

appearance...

Who you got in here with you?

He looks in and sees the very cute and sensual LETICIA GARCIA
sitting near the door.

__ DON
Chi-chi! Come skip out. Let's go
get naked...

She smiles but shakes her head ‘no." He sticks his tongue out at
her very suggestively. The teacher, MS. STROUD, suddenly looks
out the door and begins to close it.

MS. STROUD
Take it somewhere else, Mr. Dollar.
(to Pink)

You gracing us with your presence

PINK
Why not...

See you up there lacer.

DON

_ {to Ms. Stroud).

Ginny, I been meaning to ask you
out. What are you doing chis
weekend? It'll be legal...
school's out.

She rolls her eyes a bit as he walks off smiling and then closes
the door. Don continues down the hall but, without an audience,
seems a little lonely, Suddenly, MR. IRVINE walks around a
corner and looks straight at him.

MR. IRVINE .
Don, either get in a classroom or
come to my office, right now!

DON
I’m right here in Mrs. Snelgrove’s.
I was running an errand.

He quickly ducks into a classroom.

Don walks into the class and soon acknowledges Pickford,
Michelle, and JULIE DANFORD sitting in the back.

He then walks up to the teacher, MRS. SNELGROVE, an old lady on
the verge of retirement. She's reading a romance novel and
doesn’t even know he’s there until he speaks up.

CON
Mrs. Snelgrove. Mr. Irvine is out
in the hall and requests to speak

to you briefly.

Possibly not even sure if Don is in her class or not, she gets up
and walks to the door. Seeing nobody, she walks a little out
into the hall. At this, Don suddenly shuts the door behind her
and locks it. As she knocks on the door, he heads to the back of
the room and opens a window.

DON
Hey, let‘s get ouc of here.

He hops out as Pickford, Michelle, Julie, and several others
follow.

PICKFORD
Let’s go.

MICHELLE
We‘re out of here.

: JULIE
Cool...

EXT: COURTYARD OUTSIDE CLASSROOMS - DAY

Others continue to hop out the window into a courtyard area and

generally head to the parking lot.

EXT: COURTYARD - DAY

Trying to get Pink's attention, Don taps on the glass of the

window to his classroom.

INT: CLASSROOM - DAY

Inside the classroom, the students are anxiously waiting for

school to let out. Pink subtly heads to the back of the room,

opens the window, and talks to Don. In the front of the class,

Ms. Stroud is sitting and talking informally with a few of the

more interested students.

Across the room, Jodi, Shavonne and DARLA WOODS plan their
strategy.

SHAVONNE
(to Darla)
So all the supplies are in your
truck?

DARLA

Just waiting for the righe momenc.

She smiles in a sort of menacing way. The beil finally rings but
before everyone gets going, Mrs. Stroud signals for them to
listen up to one last thing.

MS. STROUD
Just remember this summer, when
you're being further inundated with
all kinds of American bi-centennial
brouhaha: what we're really
celebrating is the fact that a
bunch of slave-owning, aristocratic
white males didn't wane to pay
their taxes.

(smiles)
Have a good summer.

INT: HALLWAY - DAY

People dart out of the classroom and into the hall where scudents
are trashing it with extra paper and random contents from their
lockers. Darla, Jodi and Shavonne all head for the parking lor.

EXT: HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

Cars are starting and music is blaring. Darla checks to make
sure their supplies in the back are secure while the others pile
in. Soon they are off.

EXT; JUNIOR HIGH - DAY

Outside the junior high, all hell's breaking lose. Some $ are
running for their lives as cars of seniors take off after them.
Some boys make it to their parent's car or a school bus just
ahead of the seniors. Mitch, Tommy, and Carl all jump in
Pentico's idling car.

Hirsh makes it to the car and they speed off. Unfortunately, as
they are pulling out of the parking lot, they pull up right nexc
to the car with O’Bannion, Benny and Hudson in it. Almose

simultaneously as they are spotted, they all duck down in their
seats in total horror.

MITCH
Shit! Thac’s them. Let’s gee out
of here.

O’Bannion can barely contain himself at the sight of the entire
carload.

O’ BANNION
Shoowee! Ducks on the pond!

Pentico manages to pull out ahead of them but the chase is on.

EXT: JUNIOR HIGH - DAY

In contrast, the senior girls seem much more organized and
orderly as they load up three trucks with nervous and giggling
freshman girls. Before getting in, the seniors put pacifiers in
their mouths. With the trucks almost full, Jodi happens to
notice Sabrina standing nearby.

Jopr
Who are you?

SABRINA
(looks around)
Uh, nobody... I mean I wasn'e on
the list.

JoprI
Get in.

Sabrina looks a little hesitant at first but soon gets in the
back of one of the trucks. Jodi gives her a pacifier while
Freshman Girls #1 and #4 look a liccle miffed that Sabrina made
the cut somehow.

Sorry, ma’‘am. Just making sure
your son got home safely. You two
have a pleasant afternoon. Oh, and

He smiles at Carl like ‘I'm going to kill you when I get the
chance* and walks off. .

EXT: DAIRY QUEEN PARKING LOT - DAY

The freshman girls are in a circle with the senior girls walking
around them. The attitude of the senior girls varies from fun-

loving to sadistic. Darla seems to have assumed the role of
tyrannical drill instructor.

DARLA .
You disgusting little freshmen
sluts... AIR-RAID!
The freshmen girls are on their stomachs immediately.
DARLA
That was pitiful! On your feet,

As soon as they are all up, she yells again.

quickly.

DARLA
That means GET UP you worthless
liccle bitches!

They all get up immediately.

DARLA

They all are on the pavement quicker than ever.

DARLA
Well, we tried, we gave you a
chance. But because you little
prick teases can't quite follow
instructions, we're going to have
to try something else.

She signals to several of the others who bring over ‘the
supplies.’ Soon they are dumping rounds of flour, syrup, ketchup,
and vegetable oil all over them. Occasionally one will crack an
egg over someone’s head. Meanwhile, in the crowd of amused
onlookers, Tony and Mike analyze the proceedings as they sip
slushes.

TONY
.. What's fascinating is the way
not only the school, but the entire
community supports all this or at
least turns their heads. I mean,
they apparently have permission to
use this parking lot, no parents
seem to mind...

MIKE
And actually, the freshmen girls
are even made to feel privileged to
be participating.

Pickford goes back over to the door and locks it by sticking an
ice pick in a hole-in the fxame that acts like a dead-bolt. He
then goes over to his bottom drawer and removes it completely.
In the space below the bottom drawer, he pulls out his stash. He
grabs a pre-rolled joint off his Frisbee tray and lights it up

As the sun goes down and the music cranks up, we see various
early evening activity:

A) The lights going on at the Sonic drive-thru as a car cruises
through.

B) The lights going on at the baseball fields where games are
being played. Mitch is pitching in his game.

C) As they prepare for the evening, Jodi goes over to Shavonne
and with a pair of pliers helps zip up her almost physically
impossible tight jeans.

E) O’Bannion, Benny, and Hudson popping the top on some beers as
they drive around.

F) Pink, Pickford, and Slater pass a joint and watch Michelle in
the process of painting the Ronald McDonald statue black, white,
and red of an unspecified design. Pink takes off.

G) Tony setting out chips around the poker table while Mike makes
a phone call and Royce straightens up portraits of Washington,
Lincoln, and Kennedy that hang on Tony’s living room wall.

H) At the baseball field, seniors with their boards begin to
congregate by the dugout fence while Mitch pitches.

I) Freshman Girls #1-#4 taking turns blow drying their hair,
practicing dancing, and doing tongue exercises.

J) Jodi, Kaye and Shavonne picking up Sabrina as she sits on the
curb waiting.

K) Stoners #1 and #2 knocking on Pickford's door with the three
foot long bong in their hand. When Pickford’s father opens the
door, they look at him, then at each other, and practically
sprint away.
' 38 XT: BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT

Tommy, the catcher, approaches the mound to talk to Mitch who
looks past the dugout and sees the intimidating line of seniors
yO lined up with their boards.

TOMMY
Hey, don't worry about those
| guys... Let's just get this laste
1 guy out.
hi MITCH
! Yeah, easy for your ass to say.
' TOMMY

Just cause you're’ not going to be
able to sit down the rest of the
summer, don't let it affect your

| MITCH
' Up yours...

jhe Tommy smiles and runs back to the plate while Carl, the
1 : shortstop, comes to the mound.
' :

CARL
Hey Mitch. Can you do the rest of
Yi us a favor and leave through the
Io : gate in center field. That will
| draw them all out there and the
rest of us can get away. I mean,
they’re going to get you anyway.

MITCH
Get out of here.

CARL .

i But if you survive, cry to make it
to the party, okay? en I think
we're all camping out behind

BENNY ;
Hope you got more chan a jock strap

Tommy runs back to his pos:cion and Mitch winds up and pitches.
Strike two.

OQ’ BANNION
Don't choke now, Kerr! If you
don't get this guy out we're really
going to wear you out!

Mitch throws strike three to end the game. Amidst the hoopla, he
just stands there not knowing where to go. Eventually he gets :n
the line where the two teams walk down a row telling each ocher
"good game* but glances over at the group of seniors who are now
shadowing him. After his last ‘good game,* in which one of the
guys on the other team says ‘good luck,‘ he picks up his stuff
near the dugout, barely looks around, and then slowly walks
toward the center field gate. The seniors quickly head that way.

EXT: BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT

Later, past the centerfield’ fence, the seniors are like a group
of wild animals feeding. They take turns giving Mitch licks as
he leans against a car. When they are through, they get in their
cars and trucks and take off.

Pink walks up as the last guy, Hudson, is giving Mitch licks.

HUDSON
You next, Pink?

PINK
Yeah.

He borrows Hudson's board and stands behind Mitch, who looks up
at Pink wondering if he's going to bust him. His eyes are
completely red and watery.

HUDSON
Hey you heard Pickford’s party got
busted...
PINK
Yeah.
“HUDSON

Total rip-off, man. His old man
found out. Someone narc’ed.

Pink pulls the board back all the way like he is going to hit
Mitch hard but bluffs and stops an inch from his rear end.

He then gives him the si:shcesc tap and hands the board back to

MITCH
Think it's safe?

PINK
Yeah, should be. After you get it
bad, even the guys that haven't
busted you yet will give you a few
days. It'd be a cool move to go
out and let ‘em know it doesn't
bother you chat much.

EXT: MITCH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

They pull up to Mitch’s house where he gets out.

PINK
Be by in an hour and a half or
SO... .

INT: MAIN DRAG - NIGKT

Inside Jodi‘s car, the girls are jammin' to the Isley Brother's
“Fight the Power.* Jodi is driving and checking out everyone
they drive past. Kaye is in the passenger seat while Sabrina
sits in the back just kind of checking everything out. A carload
of girls, driven by Julie, pulls up beside them.

later as CLINT. The driver, Party Guy #1, quickly checks them
out and makes extended eye contact with Sabrina before driving

° .

PARTY GUY #1

best.

They pull away but Sabrina is perked up a bit.

‘ SABRINA
What did he say?

Kay® and Jodi decide to give Sabrina a hard time.

JODI
Who, chat gy? I think he said
something like, °The one in che
back seat looks like a dyke!*

They both howl with laughter.

SABRINA
No he didn't!

KAYE
Yeah, you're right, he actually
said: .
(mock drawl)
“Looks like the one in the back
seat could suck the chrome off a

They both shriek with laughter again.
SABRINA
Yeah, that’s exactly what he said.
INT: TONY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The guys are in the middle of a hand, but, as usual, are more
focused on their conversation than on winning another quarter.

ROYCE
Then go already.

Tony pulls out a pocket calculator and punches in some numbers

before deciding to throw in a couple of chips while Mike
continues.

MIKE

You know, just like Tony... the
slightly wimpy, slightly nerdy
type. Women are the worst when it
comes to that. Ask any high school
girl what qualities she looks for
in a guy and she‘ll say, ‘oh, that
he’s intelligent, sensitive, has a
good sense of humor.* But that
next day that same itl will be
walking down the hall getting felt-

Mike folds.

Royce starts dealing the next hand.

ROYCE
Five card drool.

reference to that subject.

Tony and Mike lower their cards and look around at each other
like ‘this should be interesting.*

ROYCE
Isn‘t it funny how everybody does
it but if someone happens to catch
you...

Mike and Tony exchange glances as if Royce speaks from personal
experience.

He gets up from the table and walks to the bathroom.

EXT: MITCH‘S HOUSE - NIGHT

Reving up in frone of Mitch’s house is a jacked-up Nova driven by
BOBBY WOODERSON. Slater sits in the passenger seat and Pink is
in the back seat. The car honks a few times impatiently before
Mitch appears and heads toward the car.

Mitch looks a bie in awe of the whole setting as they walk up to
the door.

MITCH

PINK
It‘ll be fine, just play it cool if
anybody starts messin’ with you.

INT: EMPORIUM ~ NIGHT .

They walk in the Emporium at the apex of the night's activity.
Every pool table and the all rows of foosball tables are occupied
as Dylan’s “Hurricane” rages on the multi-speaker stereo jukebox.
Everyone else is milling around talking or watching others play
but continually looking around to see who's coming and going.
Much of the room's focus is on the main table where ELVIS SPIVEY
is playing. Wooderson heads over to Elvis’ table while Pink and
Mitch follow Slater over to the foosball table where Pickford is
playing and several others, including Michelle, are hanging out.
Pickford slams home a “pull shot* and then looks up from the
table with a confident, cocky attitude.

PICKFORD
Slater, Pink, happnin’‘?

SLATER
Prickford... You winnin’?

PICKFORD
Am I winnin’? You know better than
to ask me such a question... -

He pops the ball back into play and almost immediately banks a
shot in for a score.

dube or two from you.

He puts the ball into play.

PICKFORD.
After I school this boy, I’ll be
ready to take a reefer break
myself...

He cockily swats the ball back and forth all over the table
between his various men and then does a goalie ‘toe shot’ the
length of the table for the score.

PICKFORD .

I amaze myself sometimes on this
table. .

(to Pink)
Hey man, you need to see the
finished product. .

(to Slater and Michelle)
Let‘’s go drive it around front.

Pickford and Slater head outside while Pink and Mitch lag behind
because Pink stops briefly to talk to Julie.

MITCH
Bye.

She gives Mitch a sort of double-take as she walks away. Mitch
watches her walk across the room and then interact with a group
of older guys. As Mitch and Pink stare gravitating toward the
front door, she looks over at him again. Pink stops at the pool
table where Don is in a game and gestures for him to come
outside.

EXT: EMPORIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Pickford, Slater, and Michelle drive the truck into the parking
lot. A jarge object covered with the tarp rides in the bed of
the truck. Pickford pulls right up front and then turns go as to
best display the contents in tha back to the people standing
around. Everyone's curiosity is piqued as Pickford gets out of
the truck and hops in the back for the unveiling.

PICKFORD
You guys ready?

The crowd responds favorably and at the right moment, he and
Slater jerk away the tarp. Unveiled is the Ronald McDonald
statue recently transformed into Gene Simmons of KISS with the
roperly painted face, black outfic and menacing grin, Everyone
fowls an approval. They soon get out of the truck and mix into
the crowd.

While Mitch kind of stands against the wall, Slater, Pickford,

suddenly knocks their heads together. He hops back in the car
and peels out.

Where’s loverboy?

They walk back through the party where the dance floor is filled
with junior high kids who've been dancing very slow to Olivia
Newton John‘s *I Honestly Love You.* The song changes to Bread's
“Make It With You’ and most of the dancers simply resume their
dancing in the same ‘hugging* fashion. Not. seeing their friend,
they walk back to an adjacent room that is filled with piles of
kids making out.

want to do that. I mean it sounds
good, but I really have to confront
the fact that I don't much like the

elping in the future. I don't
think I like people very much,

Hey, pull up to these trash cans.

The car slows down and pulls over next to a few trash cans chat
are sitting on the corner of somebody's front yard. Don leans
far out the window and picks up a big metal can.

. DON
Stay near this side and gun it.

The car creeps along for a little while then peels out. Ac top
speed, Don releases the trash can and it completely obliterates
a mailbox that was in a front yard. The sheer visceral chrill of
it all has the carload in an excited state.

PICKFORD
Whooaah! Man!

Almost immediately, Pink rolls the back window down and leans
out.

really aiming at anyching, Mitch tosses the ball into the air.
In a slow motion shot, the ball crashes through the windshield of
a car parked on the street. The guys seem more shocked than

thrilled at first - perhaps at the sheer extent of the property
‘damage.

Shit man... someone's car.

Mitch looks back at the broken windshield with a mixture of fear

and shame. The others start enjoying it when it becomes apparent
they’ve gotten away. .

O’ BANNION
I‘d like to dedicate this first
lick to your mother... fucker.

Just as he’s drawing back his board, at the height of his
sadistic glee, O’Bannion catches a solid drop of paint on his
arm, He holds his swing in mid-arc, dumbfounded. As he stares
at the drop, he gets another drop on che head. Confused but
curious, he looks upward just in time to see the source of his
stunning and thorough drenching in white paint and other junk
from above. In the confusion and O’Bannion’s general
helplessness, Carl sprints to Pentico’s waiting car that has
pulled up. He jumps in and they peel out.

cracking it into many pieces. He throws the piece that is left
in his hand as far as he can and leaves the rest on the ground.

The cars drive down the dark road to the clearing near the moon
tower that serves as the central gathering place. Most cars park
on the periphery but Wooderson, Benny, Don and a few others stand
next to a truck that is alone in the center with a keg of beer
sitting on its tailgate. The “McDonald/Simmons’ statue stands
right behind the keg. Two speakers have been placed up on the
truck's cab and are blaring music from a tape deck. Some clever
sorts have now wired up ‘Ronald/Gene's* stomach speaker to the
truck's CB‘s P.A. system where if you talk into the mic, it
comes out of his stomach behind the keg.

Ac first, you‘re relieved to get
away from the situation, but now
there’s a level of humiliation
setting in that I can tell is going
to be with me a long time. This
could be yet another experience
that contributes to me being a

ability to rebel against that. If
nothing else, ic’ll set an example

MITCH
Just do me a favor and don'c ask
her to cake it easy on me.

He looks at Julie and then past her where he catches eyes with
Sabrina, who's in mid-flirty conversation with Tony. They
experience a big moment of recognition and smile and shrug at
each other as if to say ‘this is the life, but this is crazy.’

EXT: NEAR PARKED CARS - NIGHT
Tony and Sabrina continue talking.

TONY
.-Isn't it someone's theory that
our entire personalities are formed
the time we're seven or so?
t's kind of depressing,
actually, think of all the stuff
we're stuck with by default.

Jodi and Kaye walk by them on their way down the road.

JODI
(smiling)
Hey guys... |

TONY & SABRINA
Hey...

JODI
We're going to take off for a bit.
You okay?

TONY
(to Sabrina)
“ T can give you a ride.

SABRINA

Okay. So I'll either see you later
or catch a ride with Tony.

Joor
Okay, cool.
SABRINA
Bye.
{to Tony)

Yeah, I know what you're talking
about. Certain things stick with

. you forever. Like when I was in
second grade, in order to get words
right on a spelling cest, we used
to make up sentences where the
first letter in each word stands
for a letter. Like arithmetic was
“A rat in the house might eat the
ice cream," and geography was
“George eats old gray rats and
paints houses yellow.’

Tony laughs.

SABRINA
Tu probably be seventy years old
and when I go to write one of those
words, one of those stupid
sentences will still go through my
head every single time.

They both laugh a bit. Darla suddenly walks up to Sabrina and
Tony. :
DARLA
(co Sabrina)
Air-raid!

They both seem kind of surprised, and Sabrina looks up at Tony.
DARLA
(even meaner)
I said air-raid freshman!
Tension mounts considerably and Tony feels a little confronted.

TONY
What for? C'mon.

This is between me and her and she

Everybody just kind of stands there.

TONY
She doesn‘c have to because she's
with me.

DARLA

. (to Sabrina)
Air-raid or its your ass!

TONY
‘ (to Sabrina)
Don't do it.

Sabrina still says nothing but looks at both of them, sort of
weighing the aggressor against the protector. A lictle unsure of
what to do, she still doesn't air-raid.

DARLA_
That's it you little freshman
bitch! I'm never going to forget
this. I'm going to make the next
year of your life hell!

Darla storms off while Sabrina and Tony just kind of look at each
other like ‘what was that?* Mike walks over cto them.

MIKE
Yeah, don't air-raid for that
bitch. I hate shit like that.
It’s like that Clint fucker in
front of all his friends...

He does a re-enactment by pushing Tony.

MIKE
> (continuing)

(pushes again)
Huh, motherfucker?

TONY
Okay, okay.

Mike suddenly sees Clint raising hell in the keg line. As if led
by some wild instinct, he starts to walk over to him.

MIKE
The dominant male monkey will get
his comeuppance.

Clint’s back is to Mike when he walks up to him. He h fyit
Seer in his hand and kind of glances around with a sLigne® a sees
quizzical look on his face. He soon focuses on Clint and pours
his ermire beer over Clint’s head. As a stunned Clint whiris
around, Mike quickly drops the empry cup and punches Clint a
fairly good one in the face. Unfortunateiy for Mike, Clint
recovers rather quickly, grabs Mike’s shirt with one hand, and
starts punching him with the other.

EXT: NEAR PARKED CARS - NIGHT

Tony can’t believe what’s happening and starts to run over to the
scene of the fight.

TONY
{to Sabrina)
: Shit, he really did it, I can’t
believe ic. :

EXT: OTHER SIDE OF KEG - NIGHT

Pink and Benny see the commotion and almost instinctively run
over to the fight. .

EXT: FIGHT SCENE - NIGHT

As Tony, Pink, and Benny arrive to try to help break it up, they
are shielded from the fight by a large wall of people circled
around the nucleus of the fight. Contradictory to Mike’s plan,
no one in the immediate vicinity seems to want to break up the
fight. Worse still, by being such eager spectators, they are
actively shielding out thoge who want to help Mike.

PINK
Move it!

Pink, Benny, and Tony (by following their lead) aggressively push
their way through the crowd. Finally, as Mike continues to get
the holy shit beat out of him, the guys break through and pull
Clint off Mike.

EXT: WOODS - NIGHT

Jodi and Kaye are walking through the woods smoking a joint when
they come across an old cemetery. They walk through it, looking
at headstones. In the distance, we HEAR cars and trucks starting
up and leaving the beer bust sight,

Kaye is soon staring at a grave and seems far, far away in her
thoughts. Jodi senses this and says nothing. Kaye suddenly
turns and starts walking out of the cemetery.

You don't want to hit him. Hell,

Pink assumes a mock~-serious pose as he walks nearer the others
like a coach ac halfcime.

PINK

People, we can't get out there and
play for ya. And IF I COULD, we
wouldn't win by two points, we'd
win by twenty-two points.

big way. They eventually roll over and then both stare up at the
clouds going by in the pre-dawn sky.

EXT: BEER BUST SITE - DAWN

Kaye and Jodi wander back to the beer bust site. Everyone seems
to have vacated although there are still a few empty cars there.
Ie seems to be getting lighter outside.

KAYE

We gotta see the sun rise from up

They walk over to the moon tower and start climbing.

EXT: DON’S HOUSE - DAWN

has a distant expression and occasionally looks down.
KAYE :

I can't stop thinking about this
tombstone I saw back there. This
girl was only 19 when she died.
1948 to 1967. It's just sad.

JODI
Sucks... But you can’t let stuff
like that bother you.

KAYE
But it‘s like who’s even thinking
about her right now?

JODI
I don’t know. People that knew
her. You're thinking of her.

Jodi rubs her eyes a little as Kaye grows a lirtle anxious.

KAYE :

Jodi rubs her eyes again and looks. Kaye stands right next to
her and puts their heads near each other so she's sure she's
looking in the right place.

Cop #1 and Don walk down the path coward the river.

DON
It was kind of dark, but I believe
we walked down here...

Don acts like he's trying to remember how they found the statue.
Of course he's trying to think what exactly Pink might have cold
the officers. Soon they are by the creek's edge.

COP #1
So where exactly was the object
when you boys made this miraculous
discovery?

Don looks around a bit for where Ronald might have been. He
points to a slight clearing at the end of the path.

DON
He was laying somewhere in this
area.

The cop seems a bit perplexed that cheir stories seem to match so
ar. .

COP #1
Okay, quick: when you found him was
he face up or 2?

Don answers as if he clearly remembers.

DON
Face up. Positive.

The officer looks at him, definitely frustrated and slightly
disgusted.

Pink and Don walk over to the car.

PINK .
Hey man, you guys goin’ to get the

PICKFORD

Before Pickford throws the car in gear and speeds away, he holds
up Aerosmith’s “Toys in the Attic* tape and gives a thumbs up.

They both stand there a little awkwardly, knowing ic is time for
che good night kiss. Tony has a sudden thought and looks around
a bit.

TONY
I smell my coin collection.

He quickly realizes this out-of-the-blue statement could not
possibly make any sense and attempts co clarify.

TONY
The oil-based cleaner I used to use
on my coin collection when I was
nine years old...

Anyway...

He leans over and kisses her. As he backs away a bit she pulls
him toward her and they have a major session. They finally parc;

They drive off.

INT: MITCH’S HOUSE - OAWN 105

Mitch walks into his house, thinking of his evening and smiling.
MITCH'S MOTHER is standing there and he momentarily gets an
“obedient son’ expression on his face. As if she’s been
preparing for hours, she’s not mad but rather reasonable when she
confronts him. .

MITCH’S MOTHER
Okay, this is your one. Your
sister told me everything so I’ve
decided to make this deal with you.
I’m going to try to be open-minded,
but next cime you come in at
sunrise, we're going to have some
trouble.

Mitch kind of shrugs his shoulders and raises his hands as if to

say ‘okay, good.’ He continues on to his room, slips off his
shoes and walks over to his bed. Not quite finished, his mother
pokes her head in his room.

MITCH’S MOTHER
(continuing)
So what, are you drunk? And who’s
