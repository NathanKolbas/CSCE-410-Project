will give him relief

CLANCY

CcON?.

CLARENCE
Do you remember when he died?

. LENNY
Do I remember the date, or actually
when it happened?

CLARENCE
The actual day.

LENNY
I wasn't born yet.

CLARENCE
Neither was I. But I remember. I
remember when I was three years old.
There was this one particular day.
I felt really depressed. For no
reason what-so-ever. -I had no idea
why, but I was feelin' low. I even
thought of suicide. I was gonna
get in the bathtub and slit my wrists
with a razor blade. I was actually
gonna do it. Now for a three
year old to be thinkin' like this,
you gotta be feelin' pretty bad.
The only reason I didn't do it was
“The Partridge Family" was about
ready to come on, and I wanted to
see it. So, I thought I'd watch
that, and do it after the show was
over. But “The Partridge Family"
was really funny that night and after
the show I was feelin' better. So,
I didn't do it. What were we talkin'
about?

LENNY
Eddie Cochran.

CLARENCE
Oh, yeah. So anyway, I find out
twenty years later that the very
day I felt so depressed for no reason,
low and behold, just so happens to
be the day that one of the greatest
rock 'n rollers of all time buys
the farm. The very same date. I'm
tellin' ya, I felt like someone spit
in my socks.

Lenny doesn't have an ansver.

MICKEY
Clarence, I have something for you,

Mickey hands Clarence the baggie of itching powder, which
Clarence immediately assumes is a bag of cocaine. Clarence can't
believe Mickey's flashing it around in front of a stranger.

CLARENCE
Mickey!

MICKEY
Clancy got it for you. Look, I gotta
go back to the front office before
Clancy ‘does something stupid.
(points at baggie)
We'll have fun with that later,

Clarence gestures “A-Okay" to Mickey. Mickey leaves.

Clarence looks at Lenny, who also assumes the bag's full of
cocaine.

CLARENCE
So, Lenny, you're cool, right?
LENNY

Clarence makes two big lines and snorts them in both nostrils
just as the song ends.

CLARENCE
We're back with the leader of the
Eddie Cochran Fan Club, Lenny Otis.
Tell me, Lenny, what first got ya
into Eddie?

Lenny's kind of stunned. After all, this is the first time
Clarence has really let him talk. He starts telling a story
about how he first heard Eddie sing “Pink Legged Slacks.” ,

As Lenny's talking, a weird look crosses Clarence's face. He
jerks his head back. First, it's an irritation, then it grows to
out anc out pain. :

CLARENCE
A Rleenix. Give me a Kleenix.

Lenny stops talking and gives Clarence a box of tissue. Clarence
is blowing his nose as Lenny continues talking.

Clarence starts rubbing his nose, then picking his nose. It gets
worse. He starts BANGING the counter with his fists.

CLARENCE
I AM IN HELL!

Clarence starts FLAILING around in the booth. He points to the
phone.

INT. RONNY'S BAR -~ NIGHT .

Small and dumpy. RONNY, the pudgy bartender, stands next to a
radio playing ELEVATOR MUSIC... Ronny hums to the schmaltzie music
as he cleans glasses. Severz! CUSTOMERS are in the bar.

Clarence walks over to the bar counter and unplugs Ronny's radio.

RONNY
Awv, come on, Clarence. Why can't
ve listen to my kind of music?
Give me one good reason.

CLARENCE
One good reason?
(laughs)
"Cause your music sucks, mine doesn't.

Clarence moves to the juke box, deposits several coins, and
pushes the appropriate buttons. Rockabilly MUSIC starts playing.
Clarence dances by himself next to-the juke box. Suddenly, he
notices MISTY KNIGHT, who's playing pool by herself. She's
very sexy and wearing a revealing dress, which accentuates her
Shapely figure.

Clarence goes back to the bar counter. He sits down on a bar
stcol. As he talks vith Ronny, he keeps glancing over at Misty.

CLARENCE
Listen up, Ronny. I'm sorta on
a mission tonight.

RONNY

Guy goes back to his table. Ronny hands Clarence a beer.

RONNY
Word travels fast in Torrance.

CLARENCE
Yeah.

Clarence keeps eyeing Misty. He decides to make a move. He gets
up, beer in hand, and approaches Misty.

As Misty leans over the pool table to make another shot, Clarence
moves behind her. She pulls back on the cue stick, POKING
Clarence in the eye.

Misty picks up a mammoth-sized purse from the floor. She pulls
out a notebook and pen, and gives it to Clarence. Clarence
writes the address down.

CLARENCE

Nice purse. Very roomy. Sorta
like a luxury model of the purses.

We have keys to each other's place.
Anyway, maybe you could go there

Clarence thinks it over. He discreetly takes out his wallet
peeking over his shoulder to see if Ronny's watching. Ronny's
eyes are practically popping out of their sockets. He leans over
the counter, peering at Clarence.

Clarence blocks Ronny's view, hands Misty the forty dollars. She
smiles, and so does Clarence.

BILL

Yeah, sure. How's Mickey doin'
anyway? I haven't seen him since
Pandora cut out on hin.

CLARENCE
You know about that?

BILL
All my customers are talkin’ about
it. And by the way, the last time
Mickey was in here,.you and him were
arguin' with me, and I want to make
my point clear. You didn't give
me a chance last time. Now, I agree
that when it came to singin' and makin'
albums and performing, Elvis was
king. But I'm sorry, as a actor,
the guy was a lost cause.

CLARENCE
Elvis was a great actor. He just
made some shitty movies.

BILL
Wait a minute. Elvis wasn't a
great actor. Marlon Brando's a
great actor. Michael Caine's a
great actor. Gene Hackman's a great
actor. You put Elvis up with those

guys?

CLARENCE
Yes. Now just hear me out. When
you say Elvis was shitty, you're
probably talkin' about the Elvis
who was in “Girls, Girls, Girls",

“Harem Scarem", “Kissin' Cousins",
or “Paradise, Hawaiian Style.”
(MORE)

CONT.

CLARENCE
That's not what I'm talkin’ about.
Not to say he was bad in those.
He was as good aS & person can be
in "Clambake." But what I'm talkin'
about is the first movies he made
like “Jailhouse Rock” .-- which is
one of Mickey's all time favorites --
“Lovin' You", “King Creole", “Flaming
Star." He was so natural, so sexy,
so Elvis. He couldda been so great
He had a wonderful natural quality
about him. What fucked him up?
"Blue Hawaii.” That was the first
of the quote “Elvis Presley movies.”
Elvis singin' a bunch of lame songs
every minute. No story. Justa .
real dog shit movie all around. But the
fuckin' thing was a hit. So asshole
Tom Parker said, “Well, that's what
the people want.” So, any chance
of Elvis growing as an actor, vworkin'
with good directors and good scripts
got shot to hell. Then they did
“Kissin' Cousins” and they found out
they could crank ‘em out in thirteen
days. So, that's why ya had a
Elvis movie out every Christmas
and every summer.

BILL
Yeah, I remember every Christmas
and summer a new Elvis and Jerry
Lewis movie would come out. And
I'd keep goin' hoping they'd be
good. But you know, his music was
like that, too. There was never
any doubt in my mind if he got
himself some good material, and put
out one good album, he'd be right
back on top. As big as he ever
was. I knew it, and so did everyone
else who was cool. Just one good
album was all it wouldda took. I
had a picture of him on the wall.
And I'd say, "Come on, Big E” --
that's what I called him -- “Come on,
Big E, you can do it.” It didn't
matter he was in his late thirties.

MICKEY

(Clint Eastwood voice)
Well, what kindda gun you carryin'
there, boy? Oh, a .38. Not a bad
gun. Let's see what it can do.

(holds pretend gun to his

head)
Boon!

(snorts)
Well, I just happen to have a .44
Magnum, the most powerful handgun
in the world. Let's see if it can
blow your head clean off.

Mickey pretends to shoot a bigger gun at Clarence. They both
laugh.

CLARENCE
Sit down here.

Mickey sits on the hood next to Clarence. Clarence reaches in-
side his coat and pulls out a joint.

CLARENCE
Here . . . goon, take it. It's
from my private stash.

Mickey takes the joint. Clarence gives him some matches.

_ CLARENCE
Tell you what, seein' as how tonight
Started on the wrong foot, why don't you
light that up, you smoke it, and
you relax. And when you're ready,
you come back inside. In the mean-
time, I'll call Misty and see if
she's home. And this time, maybe
we can get her to bring some friends,
and we really will party.

MICKEY
Misty seems like a nice girl, Clarence.

CLARENCE
Yeah, I like her. So, what do
you think? You wanna give the
birthday party one more shot?

MICKEY
(laughs)
Why not?

CLARENCE
Happy birthday, Mickey.

MICKEY
Thanks, Clarence. You're my best
friend. —
They embrace. Clarence jumps off the car hood.

CLARENCE
It's gonna be a wild mornin'!

“Clarence goes back inside the bar.

Mickey laughs. He lights up the joint, and takes a big drag.
He exhales.

Suddenly, RED AND BLUE LIGHTS start FLASHING.

CAMERA follows Mickey as he turns, revealing the rest of the car
parked in the dark alley.

Mickey realizes he's sitting on the hood of a police car. A COP
gets out of the car, and SHINES his flashlight on Mickey, who's
holding the joint.

Mickey reacts.
