Red Hot Romance


Red Hot Romance
T: 	IT'S BAD ENOUGH FOR SOME TO BOSS 
	THE REST OF US WHILE THEY ARE 
	ALIVE, BUT THE LIMIT IS REACHED 
	WHEN THEY WANT TO KEEP RIGHT ON 
	AFTER THEY HAVE CASHED IN. 

T:	FOR INSTANCE, THERE WAS OLD HARDER 
	N. STONE, THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF
	THE BRITISH-AMERICAN INSURANCE CO. 

1.	LIBRARY, STONE HOME IN WASHINGTON. 
	(Fade in.) Harder N. Stone, an old skinflint, 
	is seated at his desk writing. 

INSERT--Stone's hand writing the following: 

	   "I, Harder N. Stone, of Washington, D. C., 
	hereby direct that, should I die before my son, 
	Roland Stone, he is to receive from my estate 
	the sum of $50.00 per week and the use of my 
	residence in Washington, D. C., until his twenty-
	fifth birthday." 

	   Stone sits back and regards what he has been 
	writing, smiles smugly, and then continues writing.

INSERT--Stone's hand writing the following:
   
	   "On his twenty-fifth birthday, provided he 
	has lived according to instructions herein set 
	down, my son, Roland Stone, is to receive his 
	inheritance at the hands of my chosen executor, 
	Lord Howe-Greene, of London, President of the 
	British-American Insurance Co." 

	   Stone sits back and reads over what he has 
	written and is highly pleased.  He then rings for 
	a servant and presently Briggs enters.  He is a 
	little English butler, who has been in the family 
	for years.  Stone turns to him and tells him that 
	he has just been making out his will.  Briggs is 
	properly impressed and Stone says to him: 

SP:	"BRIGGS, I HAVE PROVIDED IN MY WILL
	THAT IF I DIE BEFORE MY SON YOU ARE 
	TO STAY ON WITH HIM AS LONG AS YOU 
	LIVE." 

	   Briggs is highly pleased, thanks him, Stone
	dismisses him, goes on writing. (Fade out.)

T:	THE OLD BOY DID DIE, AS HE DE-
	SERVED TO, AND LEFT HIS SON AND 
	HEIR, ROLAND STONE, WITH NOTHING
	TO DO BUT LIVE ON $50.00 PER WEEK.
 
2.	ROLAND'S BEDROOM.  (Fade in.)  He is
	lolling in bed in pajamas and dressing gown,
	smoking a cigarette and opening a stack of bills
	and reading them.
 
INSERT--top bill--tailor's bill with a balance from the 
	month before and about $275.00 for this month
	with a note in heavy letters "PLEASE REMIT."
	This one is turned over, and the second one is 
	from a club with a statement "You have this day 
	been posted for $179.00 and your credit is hereby
	suspended until same is paid." This bill is turned
	over and the third bill is from a florist's for $950.00
 	worth of flowers sent to Miss Rosalie Bird and 
	has a note reading: "Impossible for us to fill 
	any more orders until these bills are paid."
 
	   Roland puts down the bills in disgust, not 
	looking further, as he knows they're all alike.
 
	   Briggs, the butler, now enters and takes up
	the breakfast tray which is lying on the bed
 	opposite beside Roland.  Roland looks up to him,
	then looks at the bills, and says:
 
SP:	"HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO PAY 
	THESE BILLS ON $50.00 A WEEK?"
 
	   Briggs shrugs his shoulders as though he
	had nothing to do with it, and suggests that
	Roland's bills are too big.  He then leaves.  
	Roland looks after him, disgusted, runs through a
	few more bills, throws them on the floor and at
 	this juncture, Tom, Roland's valet, a big husky
 	negro with a child-like, innocent smile, enters the
	room with letters, goes to Roland and hands him
	the letters.  Roland looks at them and sees they 
	are more bills, puts them down.  Tom picks up
	others from floor and gives them to Roland, much
	to his disgust.  He looks up to Tom and says:

SP:	"YOU'RE A FINE 'SECRETARY'!  WHAT 
	DO I PAY YOU FOR?" 

	   Tom looks up at him, round-eyed and smiles 
	and says:

SP: 	"YOU DON'T." 

	  This is a poser for Roland for a moment, he 
	finally regains his composure and says: 

SP:	"WELL, I AM GOING TO WHEN I GET MY 
	INHERITANCE NEXT APRIL." 

	  Tom nods his head quizzically as he has heard 
	this many times before. Roland then picks up the 
	bills, runs through them again and says: 

SP:	"THE QUESTION NOW IS - HOW ARE WE 
	GOING TO LIVE UNTIL APRIL?" 

	   He sighs, reaches over to a table which has a
	little calendar on it, picks up the calendar, sees
	that it is the 13th of January, and runs through 
	the pages very dubiously.  He finally looks up 
	at Tom, shows him how many days they have to 
	live through on the calendar, and says: 

SP:	"I HAVEN'T A NICKEL AND I CAN'T 
	BORROW ANYTHING NOW.  HOW ARE 
	WE GOING TO LIVE UNTIL APRIL?" 

	   Tom looks about very dubiously. Finally he 
	gets an idea, he looks from one object of furniture 
	to another, and his idea grows until he is 
	fairly beaming and he says:

SP:	"THEY'S A MIGHTY LOT OF HOCKABLE 
	STUFF AROUND HEAH, BOSS!" 

	   He indicates the things around the room, and 
	Roland is delighted with the idea. He picks up 
	the bunch of bills, looks at the top one. 

INSERT--TAILOR'S BILL.
 
	Roland then looks around for something to pay 
	that with and his eye falls upon an antique vase. 
	He jumps out of bed, takes the vase and hands
	it to Tom together with the tailor's bill, saying
	that that will pay for that.  Roland looks at the 
	next bill.
 
INSERT--BILL FROM CLUB.
 
	Roland then takes a couple of ornaments from 
	the mantel, gives them to Tom together with the 
	club bill saying that they will pay for that. 
	Roland then looks at the next bill.
 
INSERT--FLORIST'S BILL.
  
	   Roland then takes a picture from the wall, leaving 
	a discolored place behind it, saying that will 
	pay for that. He then thinks a moment and picks 
	up a little antique clock and hands it to Tom, 
	saying:

SP:	"AND BUY HER SOME ORCHIDS WITH THIS." 

	   Tom grins, goes out loaded down with all the
	junk.  Roland looks after him, very pleased with
	himself, and, probably thinking of his girl and 
	the orchids, smiles, and fade out. 

T:	INDICATING THAT IT'S TEA TIME. 

3.	EXTERIOR COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. (Fade in.) 

	   Roland comes down the street with a bunch 
	of orchids in his hand and goes up and rings 
	the bell.
 
T:	COLONEL BIRD, OF VIRGINIA, WHO HAS 
	BEEN HANGING AROUND WASHINGTON 
	FOR THIRTY-FIVE YEARS, WAITING FOR 
	A JOB WHICH WAS FIRST PROMISED 
	HIM BY PRESIDENT CLEVELAND. 

4.	PARLOR, COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. Colonel 
	Bird, seated at a desk, very busily reading
	several large law books and making notes, trying
	to "kid" himself into believing that he is busy. 
	A colored mammy presently shows in Roland,
	who greets the Colonel very effusively.  The
	Colonel asks Roland to sit down, which he does. 
	The servant exits.  The Colonel, not being very 
	greatly impressed with Roland, excuses himself 
	and goes on with his work, explaining that he 
	has some very important matters on hand. 
	Roland looks at him, smiles to himself, then looks 
	out expectantly toward the hall.

T:	THE COLONEL'S DAUGHTER, ROSALIE, 
	THE LADY OF THE ORCHIDS.
 
5.	HALLWAY, COLONEL'S HOUSE.  Rosalie 
	comes down the stairs and enters the parlor. 

6.	PARLOR, COLONEL'S HOUSE.  Rosalie 
	rushes over, greets Roland.  The Colonel 
	rises until Roland and the girl are seated on a 
	sofa, when he sits and goes on with his
	work.  Roland gives Rosalie the orchids.  Rosalie
	thanks him, but says:

SP:	"ROLAND, YOU SHOULDN'T BUY ORCHIDS 
	EVERY DAY." 

	   She then points around to different vases in the 
	room, all of which are full of orchids. She holds 
	on to the orchids and gives Roland a little lecture 
	on economy, telling him he has no business to 
	spend his money so foolishly.  And Roland says
	he thought she liked orchids.  She says she does
	and he's a dear sweet boy to bring them, but he 
	sees she is not pleased and is correspondingly 
	depressed.

7. 	EXTERIOR  COLONEL'S BIRD'S HOUSE. 
	A low rakish roadster drives up and out of it 
	gets Jim Conwell.  He has a small sized package 
	in his hand.

CLOSE UP--And he runs up and rings the bell. 

T:	JIM CONWELL IS ONE OF THAT BROTHERHOOD 
	OF DIPLOMATIC HANGERS-ON 
	WHO MAKE A SHADY LIVELIHOOD BY 
	DOING THE DIRTY WORK OF THE VARIOUS 
	WASHINGTON EMBASSIES. 

8.	EXT. COLONEL BIRD'S PORCH. The colored 
	mammy opens the door, lets in Conwell, 
	takes his hat and coat and shows him into the
	parlor.
 
9. 	PARLOR  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. The 
	colored mammy shows Conwell in, the old 
	Colonel jumps up from his desk, and greets him 
	very enthusiastically.  His manner toward Conwell 
	is very different from his manner toward 
	Roland.  Rosalie then greets Conwell very 
	sweetly but with reserve and Roland, giving him 
	a dirty look, greets him as coldly as possible. 
	The old Colonel now gives up his work to join
	the group.  Conwell holds out his little package
	toward Rosalie and says:

SP:	"HERE'S A LITTLE THING I PICKED UP 
	IN AN ANTIQUE SHOP.  I THOUGHT 
	YOU'D LIKE IT." 

	   Rosalie puts down her orchids in Roland's 
	chair.  She then takes the package, opens it up 
	and takes out Roland's clock.  She lets out a
	cry of surprise and delight, then turns to Conwell
	and says:

SP:	"IT'S LOVELY!  I'VE ALWAYS WANTED 
	A CLOCK LIKE THAT."
   
	   Roland looks at this, open-mouthed and in 
	absolute astonishment, sits down in his chair,
 	smashing the orchids.  Rosalie then shows the
 	clock to the old Colonel and the two of them 
	rave over it, forgetting the existence of Roland, 
	who finally comes to sufficiently to see that he's
	sitting on something, gets up and picks up the 
	mashed orchids, looks at them disgustedly.  The 
	clock is finally put in place on the mantel and
	Rosalie comes back and joins Roland, who stands
	looking ruefully at the flowers in his hand.  He
	dolefully shows them to her, and she, seeing he 
	is hurt, comforts him, telling him he's a dear
	boy and she loves the orchids.  She takes them
	from him and tenderly straightens them out,
	but Roland is still in the dumps. Conwell is 
	now throwing a lot of "bull" at the old Colonel, 
	saying:

SP:	"I JUST SAID TO THE SECRETARY OF
	STATE: 'YOU'RE NOT LOOKING VERY
	WELL, ELIHU, I WISH YOU'D LET MY 
	OLD FRIEND, COLONEL BIRD, TAKE 
	SOME OF THE WORK OFF YOUR HANDS.'" 

	  He goes on spouting and the old Colonel fairly 
	eats it up.  Finally, Roland, unhappy and jealous 
	and disgusted at Conwell, gets up and tells Rosalie 
	he has to go.  Rosalie begs him to stay in 
	her sweetest manner but Roland takes another 
	look at Conwell, says no, he's got to go, says 
	good-by to Rosalie and says good-by to the 
	Colonel and Conwell, and leaves.

	STREET EXT. COL. BIRD'S HOUSE. -- Roland 
	comes out and goes dolefully down the street. 
	(Fade out.) 

	HALLWAY ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Roland 
	enters, disheartened.  Hangs up hat and coat 
	and stick and goes slowly into library. 

10.	LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE.  (Fade in.) 
	Tom is fussing about the room. Roland enters
	the room, terribly depressed and upset and starts 
	to tell Tom about the scene that just took
	place.  He goes on talking about Conwell and
	finally says:

SP:	"THE OLD MAN STANDS FOR ALL OF 
	CONWELL'S BUNK AND THINKS HE'S 
	GREAT." 

	   Tom is very sympathetic and tells Roland he 
	ought to settle the matter.  Roland agrees with 
	him, pounds on the table, and says:

SP:	"I THINK THE TIME HAS COME WHEN 
	I OUGHT TO TELL ROSALIE I LOVE
	HER!" 

	   Tom agrees with him, says that's absolutely
	right.  Roland says he knows it's right--the only
	thing to do is to come to an understanding right 
	away.  He then goes over to the telephone and 
	calls a number, and while he is waiting for the 
	number, he goes on talking to Tom, telling him 
	just how he is going to settle things and Tom
	encourages him.

11.	HALLWAY  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. 
	Rosalie comes down the hall to the telephone
 	and answers it.
 
12.	LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Roland is 
	still talking to Tom, telling him how he's going 
	to lay down the law when he suddenly hears
	Rosalie's voice over the 'phone.  All his belligerency 
	oozes out.  He smiles and stammers foolishly 
	and gulps and tries to get his courage up 
	as if he were going to lay matters right before 
	her and finally weakens and comes out with 

SP:	"HOW ARE YOU?" 

13.	HALLWAY COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. 
	Rosalie, wondering what the devil he's asking 
	her that for when he just left her, frowns quizzically 
	and says that she's feeling all right.

14.	LIBRARY  ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Roland goes
	on talking through the phone in a stammering 
	embarrassed sort of way and Tom keeps telling
  	him to go on and tell her what he was going 
	to.  Roland tries to motion to Tom and
	he goes on stammering and stuttering. 

15.	HALLWAY  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
	   Rosalie still very quizzically listening to Roland. 
	She finally asks him what is the matter with him. 

16.	LIBRARY ROLAND'S HOUSE. Roland stammering 
	into the 'phone. Finally Tom utterly 
	disgusted, comes over to the 'phone and yells in
	it:

SP: 	"HE'S TRYING TO ASK YOU TO MARRY 
	HIM, MISS ROSALIE! WILL YOU?"

	   Roland turns angrily to Tom, still holding the
	receiver to his ear, and starts to berate Tom
	soundly, when he suddenly hears something in
	the telephone which stops him. He listens, overcome
 	with wonderment and finally says:

SP:	"SAY THAT AGAIN!" 

17.	HALLWAY.  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
	Rosalie at the 'phone, laughing, says:

SP:	"YES. OF COURSE I WILL!"
 
18.	LIBRARY  ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Roland can 
	hardly believe his ears, makes her reiterate it,
	then turns to Tom in great glee and says:

SP: 	"IT'S ALL RIGHT. SHE SAYS YES."

	   He then turns back to the 'phone and asks 
	Rosalie if she really means it. While he is talking 
	to Rosalie, Tom goes over to a heavy couch, 
	pulls it out toward the hall. Roland still at the
	'phone talking, turns and asks Tom what he is 
	doing.  Tom still pulling the couch says: 

SP:	"AH'M GOING TO BUY YOU A ENGAGEMENT RING."

	   Roland smiles and nods, and suddenly thinks of 
	the clock episode, stops Tom, tells him to wait 
	a minute, then turns toward the telephone and
	says:

SP:	"WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE - A 
	RING OR A SOFA?"

19.	HALLWAY.  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.
	Rosalie listening at the 'phone is utterly dumbfounded
	at this odd request, she asks him to
	repeat it, then finally still puzzled, says:

SP:	"WHY, A RING OF COURSE! YOU SILLY BOY!"
 
20.	LIBRARY  ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Roland listening
	at the 'phone, hears Rosalie wants the ring, 
 	turns to Tom and tells him to go on and hock
	the sofa.  He then turns to Rosalie, starts in to
	talk to her ecstatically over the 'phone, smiling, 
	as we fade out.

T: 	THAT NIGHT AT THE HANGOUT OF THE 
	FRINGE OF THE DIPLOMATIC SET. 

21.	A WOP RESTAURANT. (Fade in.) This is
	a typical $1.35 Table d'Hote joint.  Seated at
	the various tables are many diplomatic hangers-
	on, all of them crooked and all looking out for 
	the main chance.  Among them is a Mexican, a 
	Frenchman, an Englishman, a German, a Russian, 
	an Italian, a Chinaman, a Jap, a Bulgarian, a 
	Hindoo and their women -- perhaps three or four 
	Americans, but the atmosphere is generally foreign, 
	the waiters being Wops.

	   Seated at one table is Conwell alone.  He is 
	eating spaghetti and looking very sourly about. 

T:	ENRICO DE CASTANET OF BUNKONIA. 

	   Enrico is seated at a table talking to a very 
	attractive vamp type of a woman. 

T:	HIS LADY FRIEND (THE INTERNATIONAL 
	VAMP AND SPY), COUNTESS 
	PULLOFF DE PLOTZ.

	   The Countess is listening very intently to 
	Enrico.  Enrico goes on talking very earnestly,
 	and finally says:

SP:	"YOU SEE, WE MUST HAVE A MAN WHO 
	CAN BE BOUGHT BODY AND SOUL." 

	   The Countess agrees with him, and perhaps 
	suggests somebody, whom Enrico says would 
	never do.  The Countess starts thinking again, 
	and, as she does, her eyes wander over the room 
	and she sees Conwell, who has just gotten up, 
	paid his bill and given the waiter a very small 
	tip, at which the waiter shows his disgust. Conwell 
	then turns to leave the restaurant, starts 
	down toward Enrico and the Countess.  The 
	Countess sees him, has a sudden idea that he 
	would be fine for the job and points him out to 
	Enrico.  At this moment, Conwell has stopped 
	to talk to someone at one of the tables, Enrico 
	looks him over from head to foot, asks the Countess 
	if she is sure he can be handled; she assures 
	him he can.
 
SP:	"HE WORKED FOR THE SHIPPING BOARD."
 
	   Enrico agrees that he looks like a good bet, 
	and just at this moment Conwell comes past the 
	table, sees the Countess motion to him.  He comes 
	over to the table, Enrico rises and the Countess 
	introduces him saying:

SP:	"SENOR DE CASTANET IS MINISTER OF 
	WAR OF BUNKONIA." 

	   Conwell is mildly interested in this fact. Enrico
	then asks Conwell to sit down, so he takes a seat, 
	and the Countess then begins to get very confidential.   
	She looks around to see that no one is looking, 
	then getting their three heads together, 
	she says in whispered tones:

SP:	"WE ARE ENGINEERING A LITTLE 
	REVOLUTION DOWN IN BUNKONIA." 

	   Conwell is a little more interested now.  He
	pricks up his ears a bit and casually glances
	around to make sure no one is overhearing, then
	looks to De Castanet for some information, and 
	De Castanet, with a quick glance around says 
	to Conwell:

SP:	"THE AMERICAN CONSUL HAS RESIGNED 
	AND A NEW ONE IS TO BE APPOINTED 
	NEXT MONTH." 

	   Conwell is still more interested, asks Enrico 
	where do I come in?  Enrico says, indicating 
	Madame: 

SP:	"I AM HERE TO SEE THAT THE 'RIGHT' 
	MAN IS APPOINTED." 

	  Conwell says "Oh ho," he sees and looks at 
	the Countess, who nods her approval.  He then 
	asks her where he comes in.  With more mysterious 
	looks, they get their heads very closely 
	together, and the Countess says:

SP:	"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU FOR
 	CONSUL? THE PICKINGS ARE GOING TO
	BE FINE FOR THE 'RIGHT MAN.'" 

	   Conwell considers a moment, smiles quizzically 
	and shakes his head and says:

SP:	"NO, I'M IN WRONG - THE SENATE
	WOULDN'T CONFIRM ME." 

	   The Countess tries to argue with him but he
	is obdurate and says there's no chance for him, 
	but as they are talking he is suddenly struck 
	with a brilliant idea.  He says, "Wait a minute." 
	They all wait and finally he speaks and says: 

SP:	"I'VE GOT JUST THE MAN FOR YOU!" 

	   They are all attention and eager to know who
 	it is.  He indicates that this must be very much
	on the quiet and then says:

SP:	"OLD COLONEL BIRD -- FINE RECORD - 
	EASY TO HANDLE -- BEEN WAITING 
	THIRTY-FIVE YEARS FOR A JOB." 

	   The Countess indicates that she knows old 
	Bird and tells Enrico that he is ideal, that they 
	couldn't do better.  Enrico asks if he can be 
	handled when the time comes.  Conwell swells 
	up and tells him to leave that to him.  It's
	the easiest thing in the world.  Enrico turns to
	Madame, who backs up Conwell and Enrico is then  
	satisfied.  Conwell then speaks up and
	says:

SP:	"I'LL GO ALONG AS SECRETARY AND 
	KEEP MY EYE ON THE OLD BOY." 

	   They both express their approval of that, 
	and indicate that he will get part of the swag. The 
	Countess leans over and says rather tauntingly: 

SP:	"I SUPPOSE THE OLD BOY'S DAUGHTER 
	WILL GO ALONG, TOO!" 

	   Conwell says he bets she will and winks the 
	other eye.  The  Countess laughs and Enrico 
	smiles, interested at the idea of a romance.  He 
	and the Countess exchange glances.  Conwell 
	then says:

SP:	"REMEMBER -- MUM'S THE WORD UNTIL 
	AFTER THE APPOINTMENT IS MADE." 

	   They all agree to that and put their heads
	together and go on with their scheming.  (Fade
	out.) 

T:	AND SO IT CAME TO PASS--

22.	PARLOR  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. (Fade 
	in.)  An old trunk in the middle of the floor 
	and the Colonel and mammy are packing in his 
	books, papers, etc.  The Colonel all full of business 
	and very busy.  Rosalie is helping, but is 
	very sad over the matter.
 
23.	EXTERIOR  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. 
	Roland rushes down the street with a newspaper
	in his hand, runs up the steps and rings the
	bell.
 
24.	PARLOR  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.  Rosalie 
	looks up quickly, thinking that this must be 
	Roland.  Mammy starts for the door but Rosalie 
	tells her she will answer the bell, and she runs 
	out into hall.

25.	HALLWAY  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.  
	Rosalie runs to the door and opens it. 

26.	EXTERIOR  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE.  
	Rosalie opens the door, and Roland rushes in. 

27.	HALLWAY  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. 
	Roland, full of excitement, grabs Rosalie, shows 
	her the article in the newspaper.

INSERT--Article in newspaper stating that Colonel Bird 
	has been appointed Consul of Bunkonia and that 
	he is to leave for there immediately with his 
	daughter and his Secretary, James Conwell. 

	   Roland asks Rosalie if this is true.  Rosalie 
	nods her head sadly, says that it is and

SP:	"I DIDN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT 
	MYSELF UNTIL THIS MORNING." 

	   Roland protests that she can't go away and 
	leave him, and Rosalie asks what she can do
	and says that her father has waited for this all
	his life and insists on taking her along.  Roland
	asks where her father is, she points into parlor, 
	and Roland tells her that he will see about 
	whether she will be taken away or not and 
	full of worry, rushes into the parlor followed 
	by Rosalie.
 
28.	PARLOR  COLONEL BIRD'S HOUSE. 
	Colonel Bird is helping mammy pack and Roland
	rushes in followed by Rosalie.  He goes to the
	Colonel and protests against taking his fiancée 
	away from him. He puts his arm around Rosalie
	and says that he wants to marry her now and
	keep her.  The Colonel can't see this at all, and 
	says:
 
SP:	"IF YOU MARRY NOW, HOW ARE YOU
	GOING TO SUPPORT HER?" 

	   Rosalie turns to Roland and says that is the
 	trouble -- that her father won't let her stay there 
	and marry him because he can't support her. 
	Roland then turns to the Colonel and says: 

SP:	"BUT, COLONEL, IN ANOTHER MONTH 
	EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT!" 

	   Rosalie seconds the motion and tries to persuade 
	her father that everything will be all right, 
	but her father shakes his head, looks grimly at 
	Roland and says:

SP:	"THAT'S WHAT CLEVELAND SAID TO ME 
	IN '89." 

	   Roland looks discouraged and realizes that he 
	is up against a hard proposition in the old 
	Colonel, but tries to explain that if they can just 
	struggle along for a month he will have millions, 
	but the Colonel says:

SP:	"WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR INHERITANCE 
	RIGHT IN YOUR HAND, COME DOWN TO 
	BUNKONIA AND GET HER." 

	   Roland, much discouraged, still tries to argue 
	with the old boy, but he cuts him off and goes 
	on about his work. Roland then turns to Rosalie, 
	who by this time is in tears.  At the sight of 
	Rosalie's tears, Roland forgets his own disappointment, 
	and putting his arm around her, leads 
	her off to a secluded corner out of sight of the 
	old Colonel, seats her and tries to comfort her, 
	putting his arm around her and saying: 

SP:	"THE FIRST OF APRIL IS MY BIRTHDAY. 
	I GET MY INHERITANCE THAT DAY AND 
	I'LL START AT ONCE FOR BUNKONIA." 

	   At once Rosalie looks up at him with her eyes 
	full of tears and  smiles wanly.  Roland takes 
	her hand, wipes away her tears, kisses her and
	says:

SP:	"I'LL SEND YOU A CABLE EVERY DAY!" 

	   At this Rosalie is greatly cheered up, she looks
	and says:  "Will you, dear?" and he assures her
	that he will and again kisses her.  (Fade out.)

	and a soap box on which are Roland's mirror
	and toilet articles.

	   Roland is asleep on the couch. Presently 
	Briggs enters, looks about at the devastated 
	room, then shaking his head over the laziness
	of his master, goes wakes Roland up and
	says:
 
SP:	"I WISH YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SIR."

	   Roland wakes up, looks at him, rubs his eyes, 
	realizes that his probation is over.  Tom enters 
	smiling with a telegram in his hand which he
	gives to Roland who opens it and reads:
  
INSERT--TELEGRAM.
 
	   New York, March 31, 1920. "Arrive Washington 
	four-forty to-morrow, April first, to deliver
  	inheritance.                   HOWE-GREENE."
 
  	   Roland jumps out of bed, goes over and claps
 	Briggs on the back and shakes hands with him -
 	then shakes hands with Tom. Then makes Briggs
 	and Tom shake hands.  Tells them both he's 
	going to have loads of money and they will be
	paid. Roland then goes over to his soap box 
	on which is a calendar. He looks at page marked 
	"March 31." Tears it off and looks at page 
	marked "April 1." 

	He tears off the page with a flourish which
 	reads March 31st, turns it over and, sitting on
 	the floor, writes on the back of it.  Tom in the
 	meantime sends Briggs for his breakfast and 
	gets out Roland's clothes, brushing them with 
	great gusto.  Roland finishes writing and reads 
	what he has written.

INSERT--WHAT ROLAND IS WRITING. 

	   "Miss Rosalie Bird, Santo Grafto, Bunkonia.  At
	last the great day is here.  Lord Howe-Greene
	arrives to-day with my inheritance.  Leave for
	Bunkonia to-morrow to claim you as my bride.
	Roland."
 
	   He reads it and tells Tom to send it. Tom takes 
	the message, scratches his head and looks 
	around the room for something to hock.  Roland 
	wants to know why he's hesitating, and he tells 
	him.  Roland then says: 

SP:	"TAKE THE COUCH!" 

	   Tom looks at the couch dubiously, then looks 
	at Roland and says:  "Where are you going to 
	sleep to-night?"   Roland, in an extravagant 
	manner and with a grand flourish, tells him to 
	take it away.
 
SP:	"I WON'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP TO-NIGHT 
	ANYWAY!" 

	   Tom goes over, picks up the couch and starts
	out of the room with it.  At the door, Roland
	stops him, picks up the one remaining chair, 
	hands it over to him and says:

SP:	"CABLE HER SOME ROSES WITH THIS!" 

	   Tom takes the chair, starts for the door when 
	he suddenly thinks of the fact that Lord Howe-
	Greene is due that morning, so he stops, turns to 
	Roland and says: 

SP:	"WHAT DAT LORD HOWE-GREENE TO
	SIT ON WHEN HE COMES?"
 
	   Roland says that's right, so he leaves the chair 
	and starts out with the couch.  Briggs in the 
	meantime has entered with Roland's breakfast. 
	Puts breakfast on soap box.  Roland tells him 
	to put the chair down in the hall.  Briggs doleful. 
	Roland slaps him on the back -- tells him to cheer 
	up.  Briggs goes out shaking his head and Roland 
	sits on chair and starts his breakfast all 
	smiles.  (Fade out.)

	Roland's taxi drives up and stops, followed by 
	Tom's.  Roland and Lord Howe-Greene with
	portfolio get out.  Tom also gets out with bags. 
	Howe-Greene starts up walk. Tom stops Roland 
	and shows him three cents -- all he has and whispers 
	to him, saying:

SP:	"HOW DO I PAY THE TAXI?" 

	Roland signifying that he can't be annoyed with
	such little things, says grandiloquently:
 
SP:	"TELL THEM TO WAIT!"

	   He follows Lord Howe-Greene up the walk 
	while Tom goes to the taxis and tells them to wait. 
	Then he follows with bags.
 
33.	RECEPTION HALL  ROLAND'S HOUSE. 
	It is perfectly bare.  Briggs is just coming down
 	the stairs carrying the one chair that is left, he
 	puts it down, looks around at the bare hall,
	shakes his head sadly, dusts off the one chair,
	then looks up quickly at hearing bell ringing, goes
	over to the door.

34. 	FRONT OF ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Briggs
	opens the door and lets Roland and Lord Howe-
	Greene in followed by Tom with bags. 

35.	HALLWAY  ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Roland and
	Lord Howe-Greene enter, followed by Tom and
	Briggs.  Briggs is delighted to see the old Englishman
	but is terribly chagrined at the condition 
	of the house. He takes Lord Howe-Greene's
 	coat and hat, and Roland engages Lord Howe-
	Greene in talking, then motions to Tom to get 
	the chair into the library.  Tom sneaks the 
	chair around behind Lord Howe-Greene and into 
	the library.

36. 	LIBRARY.  Tom sneaks the chair in, puts it
	down near the fireplace.

37.	HALLWAY  ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Roland
	noticing that Tom has the chair placed, escorts 
	Lord Howe-Greene into the library with a grand 
	flourish.
 
38.	LIBRARY.  Tom is standing behind the chair. 
	Lord Howe-Greene and Roland enter. Tom seats 
	Lord Howe-Greene very ceremoniously in the 
	chair.  Lord Howe-Greene looks around the
 	empty room and is astounded. He turns to 
	Roland and says: "I say, old fellow, the place looks 
	rather beastly bare.  Where's the furniture?" 

	   Roland thinks for a moment, looks at Tom; Tom 
	does some quick heavy thinking and finally says, 
	very graciously:

SP:	"WE SENT THE FURNITURE OUT TO BE 
	CLEANED IN HONOR OF YOUR COMING." 

	   Roland smiles in relief and in approval of Tom, 
	and then says:
 
SP:	"THE CLEANERS ARE ON STRIKE SO 
	THEY DIDN'T GET IT DONE IN TIME." 

	   Lord Howe-Greene blandly accepts the explanation 
	and thanks him for his thoughtfulness. 
	Roland, who has been fondling the portfolio, can 
	hardly wait for it to be opened, and he gives it to 
	Lord Howe-Greene and then goes and stands by 
	the mantel with Tom.  Lord Howe-Greene fishes 
	out the papers, finally comes to the will and
	starts to read the glad news.  He reads for a
	moment and then 

INSERT--"That providing said Roland Stone has carried 
	out previous instructions of the will, his 
	father provides as follows:" 

	   Roland, overcome with impatience, begins to 
	get even more interested.  Lord Howe-Greene 
	clears his throat and goes on reading: 

INSERT--"I bequeath to my son, Roland Stone, one 
	unencumbered position in the Anglo-American 
	Insurance Co. as soliciting agent with a guarantee 
	of $25.00 per week." 

	   Roland looks in astonishment at Lord Howe-
	Greene as does also Tom.  Lord Howe-Greene
	clears his throat again and goes on reading: 

INSERT--"If at the end of one year, the business said 
	Roland Stone procures for the company has 
	proven profitable, the same will be a proof of 
	his good business judgment, and he is then to 
	come into possession of my entire fortune." 

	   Roland stares simply open-mouthed in astonishment
	and  disappointment, while Tom can 
	hardly believe his ears.

INSERT--"If on the other hand, the company at the 
	end of one year has suffered a loss through the 
	agency of said Roland Stone, my entire fortune 
	shall be given to the support of the Washington 
	Home for Incurables." 

	   Roland, absolutely dumbfounded by the news, 
	stares at Lord Howe-Greene, then looks around 
	at Tom.  Tom looks at Roland accusingly. 

	   Roland then turns in discouragement and asks 
	Lord Howe-Greene if there's any more.  Lord 
	Howe-Greene goes on reading:

INSERT--"It is further provided that conditions under 
	which said Roland Stone is to work, shall be 
	subject to the approval of Lord Howe-Greene." 

	   Roland is utterly unable to take all of this in, 
	and he insists on reading it himself. Lord Howe-
	Greene hands it to him, and Roland starts in to 
	read it as though he could hardly believe his
	eyes.  Tom looks over his shoulder, and, finally
	disgusted with the whole proceeding, he goes 
	over toward the window, stands there dejectedly 
	and looks out.

	a terrible shock on seeing the taxis and realizing
	that they can't pay them.  He then goes over 
	to Roland, and tells him that the two taxis are
	out there, eating their heads off.  Roland looks 
	out toward the window, thinks about the taxis,
	then looks over to Lord Howe-Greene, who is 
	sitting comfortably in the last chair, thinks a 
	moment, then goes over to Lord Howe-Greene, 
	excuses himself, takes the chair from under the 
	utterly flabbergasted Lord Howe-Greene, gives 
	it to Tom and tells him to take it out to pay the 
	taxis.  Tom takes the chair and goes out, Lord Howe-
	Greene looking after him in wide-eyed 
	astonishment.  Roland then turns to Lord Howe-
	Greene and starts in to protest about the conditions 
	of the will, but Lord Howe-Greene tells
	him that there is nothing that he can do. He
	takes the papers from Roland.  Sits on window
	sill (especially built) and starts in to read the 
	long document to Roland.  Roland trying to 
	follow Howe-Greene gets disgusted, leans against 
	wall and at length slips to floor and sits there 
	disconsolate, thinking of his rotten luck and of
	the girl away off with his rival.  (Dissolve out.)

	   Lord Howe-Greene is still sitting on window

	look, puts his hands on his ears and at length 
	jumps up and stalks out into the hall, leaving 
	Howe-Greene still reading.

43.	HALLWAY--ROLAND'S HOUSE.  Roland 
	rushes in from library, looks back disgusted at 
	Howe-Greene, who is still reading.  At this moment 
	Tom enters from street, goes to Roland, 
	looks at him despondently, and says: "What are 
	we going to do now?"  Roland puts his hand on 
	Tom's shoulder, and says with great emphasis: 

SP:	"LOOK HERE, TOM, YOU'VE GOT TO 
	THINK OF SOME WAY TO GET ME TO 
	ROSALIE!" 

	   Tom thinks a moment, finally his face brightens 
	and he says:

SP:	"IF YOU'VE GOT TO SELL INSURANCE, 
	WHY NOT SELL IT IN BUNKONIA?" 

	   Roland is delighted at this, and tells Tom he 
	knew he'd think up a way out -- that they can 
	start for Bunkonia to-morrow just as they had
	planned.  Tom says of course they can.  Roland
	says they will put it up to Lord Howe-Greene at 
	once and they go into the library. 

44.	LIBRARY, ROLAND'S HOUSE.
	   Lord Howe-Greene still sitting reading.  Roland 
	and Tom enter, see him, and stop, both 
	disgusted.  Howe-Greene finishes his reading. 
	Gets up and goes to them -- gives Roland the 
	document, tells him it is very important for him 
	to keep it safe.  Roland puts it in his pocket 
	then turns to Howe-Greene and says: 

SP:	"I'VE BEEN THINKING THINGS OVER, 
	AND I'VE DECIDED THAT IF I HAVE TO 
	SELL INSURANCE, I WOULD LIKE VERY 
	MUCH TO GET AWAY FROM WASHINGTON." 

	   Lord Howe-Greene indicates that he understands 
	his feelings in the matter, thinks a moment 
	and says:

SP:	"I HAVE IT! YOU SHALL TRY NEW YORK." 

	   Roland looks at him in utter astonishment and 
	says he is surprised that Lord Howe-Greene 
	would suggest such a terrible place to sell insurance.  
	He then turns to Tom and Tom agrees 
	with him.  Roland then says to Lord Howe-
	Greene,
 
SP:	"NEW YORK WOULD NEVER DO! IT'S A
	TERRIBLE PLACE FOR INSURANCE!"

	   Lord Howe-Greene is interested, and wants to 
	know why, and Roland goes on saying:

SP:	"WHY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE 
	KILLED THERE DAILY!" 

	   Lord Howe-Greene is tremendously interested 
	and surprised and wants to know how.  Roland
	goes on to describe the terrible life that 
	New Yorkers lead and we fade out.

 	to move back.  Everybody about him is mashed 
	flat but still he pushes more in. (Fade out.)
  
	   Roland concludes his story about the terrible 
	life in New York and Lord Howe-Greene greatly
	surprised at this says: 

SP:	"MY WORD!"
 
  	   Roland appeals to Tom for confirmation and 
	Tom nods his head and says that he hasn't heard
	the half of it.  Lord Howe-Greene shakes his
	head, thinks a moment and says: 

SP:	"THEN YOU SHALL TRY CHICAGO!"
  
	   Roland is surprised at his suggesting Chicago,
	shakes his head, and says: 

SP:	"CHICAGO IS WORSE.  PEOPLE ARE
	BLOWN TO DEATH IN CHICAGO BY
	MILLIONS!"

	   He turns to Tom and Tom confirms this and 
	Lord Howe-Greene, extremely puzzled and surprised, 
	wants to know how.  Roland then goes
 	on to describe a scene of how people are blown to 
	death in Chicago, along Michigan Avenue.  (Fade 
	out.)

	   Roland finishes his tale about Chicago, and Tom 
	agrees with him, shaking his head and saying: 
	"It is indeed a terrible sight to see this thing 
	that Roland just described!"  Lord Howe-Greene 
	shows great distress, and shakes his head again 
	and exclaims: 

SP:	"MY WORD!" 

	   Roland looks over at Tom and gives him a
	wink.  Tom gives Roland the high sign and the
	two of them feel that things are going fine when 
	suddenly Lord Howe-Greene scratches his head 
	and gets a brilliant idea.  He then tells Roland 
	that he has just the place for him and says: 

SP:	"I HAVE A COUSIN--A REAL ESTATE 
	AGENT IN LOS ANGELES--WHO WRITES 
	ME THAT THE CLIMATE IS SO SALUBRIOUS 
	THAT EVERY ONE LIVES TO A RIPE 
	OLD AGE." 

	   Roland looks at Lord Howe-Greene in astonishment, 
	feeling that he has been stuck at last. 
	Lord Howe-Greene then pats him on the shoulder 
	and says:

SP:	"THAT'S THE PLACE FOR YOU, MY BOY!" 

	   Roland looks genuinely alarmed and turns to 
	Tom for aid, but Tom himself is pretty much 
	stumped at this.  Lord Howe-Greene feeling 
	that their problem has been settled, says that 
	that's exactly the place and everything will be 
	fine.  Roland stalls, does some quick, heavy thinking, 
	finally gets an idea, and says: "Lord Howe-Greene, 
	that's exactly where you're wrong." 

SP:	"THE TROUBLE OUT THERE IS THAT 
	PEOPLE NEVER DIE. THEY WON'T BUY 
	INSURANCE!"

	   Roland is rather pleased with himself for
	thinking up this and Tom congratulates him on 
	it, smiling his approbation.  Lord Howe-Greene
	can hardly believe this angle of the situation,
	says he doesn't think that's possible. Roland,
	realizing that he has got to spike this says:

SP: 	"WHY I TRIED TO SELL INSURANCE
	OUT THERE ONCE AND WHAT DO YOU
	THINK HAPPENED?"

	   Lord Howe-Greene is interested and wants to
	know what did happen to him. Tom looks rather
	quizzically at Roland, feeling that he is getting
	out beyond his depth. Roland clears his throat 
	and starts in to describe what happened.  (Fade
	out.)

45.	FRONT OF BUNGALOW IN LOS ANGELES.
	(Fade in.)
 	   Three men with white whiskers to their waist
	are playing leap-frog on the lawn. Roland comes
	down the street, approaches one with an insurance
	circular in his hand and asks if he could
 	interest him in some insurance. The old fellow
	says:
 
SP:	"NO, I DON'T WANT ANY INSURANCE
	BUT YOU MIGHT SEE PA." 

	   Roland is surprised that a man of his age
	should have a father and asks where he is.  The
 	old fellow points to the front door of the bungalow
	and says:
 
SP:	"HE'S HELPING GRANDPA CARRY THE
	PIANO UP IN GRANDMA'S ROOM." 

	   Roland can hardly believe his ears at this and
	says "What?"  The old man nods and says:

SP:	"YES, GRANDMA IS GOING TO TAKE 
	MUSIC LESSONS."

	   Roland looks aghast at the old man who goes 
 	back to his leap-frog, and finally coming to,
	goes up to the house and rings the bell while the 
	three old boys continue their leap-frog.  Presently 
	a youthful looking Jap with long, white 
	whiskers opens the door.  Roland asks for the 
	father and is shown in.

46.	HALLWAY  LOS ANGELES BUNGALOW. 
	Roland enters with the Jap servant.  Pa and
 	Grandpa--one with whiskers to the knees and 
	one with whiskers to the ankles--are lifting a
	piano up the stairs.  Roland approaches pa and
	asks him if he could interest him in insurance.
	Pa holds the piano with one hand, with the other  
	takes the young man's circular and looks at it.
	He then shakes his head no, turns to grandpa  	
	and says: "Father, do you want any insurance?"
	Grandpa asks to see the circular and Pa hands it
  	up to him.  Grandpa looks at it a minute, then
	looks at Roland, shakes his head and says:

SP:	"I THINK NOT, SON. I CAN LOOK AFTER 
	MY FAMILY FOR A FEW YEARS YET,
	AND BY THAT TIME THEY'LL BE ABLE 
	TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES." 

	   He hands the circular back to Roland and he 
	and Pa pick up the piano and go on upstairs,
	Roland looking after them in absolute amazement.

	Roland finishes his story about Los Angeles. 
	Turns to Tom who confirms everything he has
 	said.   Lord Howe-Greene, shaking his head in
	amazement over these extraordinary conditions 
	in America, says very weakly--

SP:	"MY WORD" (in very small type).

	   And Lord Howe-Greene is very much distressed. 
	He feels that this case is baffling him. He finally
	looks up hopelessly and asks Roland what they're
	going to do.  Roland, puzzled, turns to Tom
	and asks him what he thinks of the situation. 
	Tom thinks a moment, finally gets an idea, turns 
	to Lord Howe-Greene and says:

SP:	"IF YOU COULD ONLY GET HIM TO GO 
	DOWN TO BUNKONIA." 

	   Roland pooh-poohs this idea and says no, he 
	never would, he couldn't go there because it is 
	too far away.  But Tom goes on into raptures
	about Bunkonia, telling him what a marvelous 
	place it is for business of all kinds, and Lord 
	Howe-Greene, glad of some solution to his problem, 
	finally jumps at the idea -- turns to Roland
 	and says:

SP:	"THAT'S AN IDEA!  NEW COUNTRY -
 	VIRGIN FIELD - IT'S JUST THE PLACE
	FOR YOU!" 

	   Roland thinks a minute as though he had to 
	be convinced, but Lord Howe-Greene keeps on 
	begging him to take a chance.  Tom joins Lord 
	Howe-Greene in urging him, and finally Roland
	allows himself to be persuaded, decides that he
	will go, Lord Howe-Greene shakes him warmly

	and then wraps three times on the gate.  The
 	gate is opened by a villainous servant and Enrico 
	enters.
 
54.	REVOLUTIONISTS' RENDEZVOUS.  The 
	revolutionists are still talking together and they 
	see Enrico entering.  They gather about him to 
	get the news and Enrico says:

SP:	"THEY WERE ALL DRUNK TO-NIGHT. IT 
	WILL SOON BE TIME TO STRIKE." 

	   They all rejoice at this. Enrico asks the General 
	about the army and he replies:

SP:	"TWO HUNDRED OF THE ARMY ARE 
	WITH US NOW. IT WILL TAKE A HUNDRED 
	PESETAS TO WIN OVER THE 
	OTHER FIFTY." 

	   Enrico is very angry at this, and asks him what 
	he means by a hundred pesetas, and is very sore 
	at the tremendous cost at buying these men. 
	The Countess stops his raving, putting her finger 
	over his lips, goes into her stocking, takes out 
	the money and gives the General two bills, which 
	amount to more than he has asked for. He then 
	turns to Conwell and starts in to talk.  The
	General puts the money in his pocket but Enrico
	notices him and says:

SP:	"HERE! HERE! GIVE US THE CHANGE!" 

	   Reluctantly the General digs it up, starts to 
	pass it over to the Countess but Enrico stops 
	him before the Countess notices, grabs the money 
	and puts it in his own pocket.  Enrico then
 	crosses over to Conwell and says: 

SP:	"ARE YOU SURE WE CAN HANDLE OLD 
	BIRD WHEN WE'RE READY?" 

	   Conwell tells him it's the easiest thing in the 
	world, that the old man has got to do just what 
	he says and winds up with:
 
SP:	"DIDN'T I GET HIM THIS JOB?" 

	   They all seem satisfied with this and go on
	plotting.  (Fade out.)

T:	ON THE EDGE OF THIS POLITICAL VOLCANO 
	SITS OUR OLD FRIEND, COLONEL 
	BIRD, AT PEACE WITH ALL THE WORLD 
	IN THE FULLNESS OF HIS IGNORANCE.

55.	COLONEL BIRD'S ROOM IN THE CONSULATE.  
	(Dissolve in.)  Colonel Bird is sitting 
	at his desk reading a political book. Mammy is
	straightening room and dusting.  Rosalie enters
	dressed for the street. She goes to the Colonel,
	looks over his shoulder, tells him that he works 
	too hard, makes him promise he will get some 
	rest and kisses him good-by and goes out. 

56.	CONWELL'S ROOM IN THE CONSULATE. 
	Conwell is sitting at his desk very busily but
	rather slyly making out a report.  Rosalie comes
	from her father's room, says good morning to
	Conwell and starts to pass through.  Conwell 
	immediately jumps to his feet, comes to her, and 
	stops her, admiring her dress, etc.  Rosalie shows 
	by her attitude that she has begun to fear this 
	man. She starts to pass him but he takes her by 
	the hand, restrains her and says:

SP:	"HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU GOING 
	TO KEEP ME WAITING?" 

	   Rosalie is embarrassed and doesn't know what 
	to say.  She tells him that she doesn't care about 
	him in that way and he finally says:

SP:	"DON'T YOU THINK YOU OWE ME SOMETHING 
	AFTER ALL I'VE DONE FOR 
	YOUR FATHER?" 

	   She expresses her gratitude for the help he has 
	been to her father but doesn't quite see why 
	she should marry him for that reason.  Conwell 
	is getting impatient and finally says:

SP:	"YOUR FATHER AS GOOD AS PROMISED 
	THAT YOU'D MARRY ME." 

	   Rosalie is surprised and incredulous, says she 
	doesn't believe it and turns and goes to the door. 
	Conwell tries to restrain her but doesn't succeed. 
	Rosalie calls in to her father and asks if he will 
	come in.

57.	COLONEL BIRD'S ROOM AT CONSULATE. 
	Colonel Bird puts down his book and goes in to 
	Conwell's room.

58. 	CONWELL'S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Rosalie 
	looks up at her father almost in tears and 
	asks if he promised that she marry Conwell. 
	Colonel Bird berates Conwell for suggesting such 
	a thing, tells her she shall marry the man of 
	her choice.  Conwell protests that Bird is indebted 
	to him for his job, Colonel Bird straightens 
	himself up with great dignity and says: 

SP:	"WELL, SIR, DIDN'T I MAKE YOU MY 
	SECRETARY?" 

	  Conwell looks at him as much as to say - 
	"You poor old simp - just wait."  Colonel Bird 
	takes Rosalie to the door, kisses her good-by and 
	she goes out.  He then turns to Conwell and 
	tells him to stop annoying his daughter. 

59.	EXTERIOR  CONSULATE.  Rosalie comes out 
	and goes down the street toward the station. 

60.	CONWELL'S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Colonel 
	Bird is still laying down the law to Conwell 
	who nods his head, and Colonel Bird goes back 
	to his own room.  Conwell looks after him in 
	a menacing way, then shakes his fist after him 
	and suggesting that he will get even with him 
	yet.  He then gets his hat and goes out.  (Fade 
	out.)
 
61. 	RAILWAY STATION AT SANTO GRAFTO. 
	Station master is there, baggage man, three or 
	four natives, some kids and several pretty native 
	girls.  Rosalie also is waiting.  The train comes 
	in, a couple of soldiers get off and greet the girls. 
	Two natives get off and then Tom and Roland 
	get off.  Rosalie rushes to them.  Roland kisses 
	her, she greets Tom and leads them off. 

62.	BACK OF SANTO GRAFTO STATION. 
	Carriage waiting with native driver.  Rosalie 
	enters with Roland and Tom, they get into the
	carriage and drive off. (Fade out.)

T:	THE HOTEL DEL MOSQUITO.
 
63.	FRONT OF HOTEL. (Fade in.) There are 
	several tables in front of the hotel and also
	several booths and a sign over the entrance. 
	Several people are sitting at the tables drinking.
	At one table sits the Countess and Enrico. Conwell 
	enters and joins them, rather sore over his  
	rebuff by Rosalie. They ask him why so grouchy 
	and he tells them. They give him the laugh but 
	Enrico slaps him on the back and tells him she 
	will come around all right.  Waiters are going 
	in and out.  A pretty girl is selling flowers, a 
	couple of musicians are playing guitars.  Carriage
 	drives up with Rosalie, Roland and Tom.  Tom
 	and Roland get out, a native porter comes from 
	the hotel and takes their bags into the hotel 
	followed by Tom, while Roland stops to speak to 
	Rosalie.  Conwell looks up, sees Roland and is  
	very much disturbed. He calls the attention of his 
	two friends to Roland and tells them who he is 
	and they all look searchingly at him. Roland says 
	a very affectionate good-by to Rosalie and says:

SP:	"MAY I COME TO SEE YOU THIS 
	EVENING?" 

	   Rosalie tells him that he may, bids him good-by 
	and he watches her drive away, sighs and turns
 	and goes into hotel.  Conwell half hides so that
	Roland won't see him. After he is well out of 
	sight Conwell starts to grumble at his ill luck at
	having this fellow come down here.  Enrico pats
	him on the back, whispers in his ear and says: 

SP:	"WE CAN PUT HIM OUT OF THE WAY 
	DURING THE REVOLUTION."
 
	   The Countess nods that this will be easy but 
	Conwell looks doubtful, shakes his head and says: 

SP:	"NO, IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR 
	US -- HE'S TOO WELL KNOWN IN 
	WASHINGTON." 

	   Conwell shows his anger and chagrin at the 
	turn of affairs. Enrico shrugs his shoulders but 
	the Countess starts in to think of some way out. 

64.	HALLWAY OUTSIDE ROLAND'S APARTMENT. 
	Porter enters with Roland and Tom, 
	opens door and they enter Roland's room. 

65.	ROLAND'S APARTMENT IN THE HOTEL. 
	The porter shows Tom and Roland in.  Roland 
	is quite pleased with the place, tips the porter 
	generously; the porter leaves, followed by Tom and 
	his bag.

66.	FRONT OF HOTEL. Conwell is still cursing 
	his luck.  Enrico is sympathetic but helpless. The 
	Countess is thinking heavily and finally gets an
 	idea.  She leans over, pats Conwell on the hand
 	and says:

SP: 	"THERE'S SOMETHING ON EVERY MAN
 	IF YOU CAN ONLY FIND IT.  LEAVE IT
 	TO ME. I'LL FIND SOMETHING TO HANG 
	ON HIM." 

	   Enrico approves of this, Conwell is slightly 
	interested and the Countess goes on explaining 
	that she has tackled many a difficult proposition 
	and won out. Just to leave it to her. (Fade out.) 

T:	EVENING.
 
67.	BEAUTIFUL COURTYARD OR GARDEN 
	AT THE CONSULATE.
  	   Roland, dinner coat, and Rosalie, evening dress, 
	and the Colonel are there.  Roland has just 
	finished telling the story of his dad's directions 
	regarding his fortune and he finishes up by saying 
	to Rosalie:

SP:	"SO WE'VE GOT TO WAIT ANOTHER 
	YEAR, ROSALIE." 

	   She takes his hand and says she doesn't mind 
	at all, she knows he'll be a great success.  The 
	old Colonel comes to him, takes him by the 
	hand and says:
 
SP:	"I'M GLAD SOMETHING HAS SET YOU TO
 	WORK, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO WIN TO 
	GET ROSALIE." 

	   Roland thanks the Colonel, tells him he knows 
	it and that he's going to make good. The Colonel 
	rather brusquely tells him he hopes he does and 
	then leaves.  Rosalie runs to Roland, tells him 
	she knows he's going to make good.

68.	HALLWAY OUTSIDE ROLAND'S APARTMENT.
	   The Countess enters, looks around 
	stealthily, goes to the door, tries it, finds it 
	locked, takes a hairpin from her hair, unlocks
	the door with it, looks around and enters. 

69.	ROLAND'S ROOM IN HOTEL.  The Countess
	in dark evening dress enters and closes the door. 
	Begins to rummage  around among Roland's
 	things in his wardrobe trunk   She finally uncovers
	lot of blank insurance policies.   She
	shows great interest in the discovery of the
	papers, as papers are one of her main stock in 
	trade. She starts feverishly to examine them. 

INSERT--HANDFUL OF INSURANCE BLANKS.
 
	   The Countess looks at them in disgust, puts 
	them back where she found them and goes on 
	hunting.

70.	GARDEN OF CONSULATE.  Another very
	beautiful shot with Rosalie and Roland standing 
	or sitting on a bench planning their future. 

71. 	ROLAND'S BEDROOM IN HOTEL.  The
	Countess still rummaging around.  Down in the
	bottom drawer of the trunk, she discovers a copy
 	of Roland's father's instructions which have been
	given him by Lord Howe-Greene.  She pounces on
	this and reads it.

INSERT--If at the end of one year the business said
	Roland Stone procures for the company has
	proven profitable, the same will be proof of his 
	good business judgment and he is then to come 
	into possession of my entire fortune. 

	   Countess ponders over this a moment, then 
	reads next paragraph: 

INSERT--Part of statement as follows:

	   "If, on the other hand, the company at the 
	end of one year has suffered a loss through
	agency of said Roland Stone, my entire fortune 
	shall be given to the support of the Washington 
	Home for Incurables." 

	   The Countess gloats over this discovery, carefully  
	replaces  everything just as she found it, 
	conceals the paper in her dress and stealthily 
	leaves the room.

72.	EXTERIOR OF CONSULATE. Roland is just 
	bidding Rosalie good-night.  She is expressing
	her good wishes for his success.  Roland looks
	out toward the view of Bunkonia, then turns to 
	Rosalie and says:

SP:	"WHY, IN A VIRGIN FIELD LIKE THIS, I 
	CAN'T HELP BUT MAKE THE COMPANY 
	MONEY." 

	   Rosalie is just as certain as he is about it. 
	He then goes on telling her that in just one 
	little year he will be claiming her.  Rosalie is 
	delighted.  Roland timidly kisses her, says good-
	night and leaves.  Rosalie looks after him and 
	sighs.

73. 	CAFE OF THE HOTEL. Enrico and Conwell 
	sitting at a table smoking and drinking.  Conwell 
	is quite nervous and irritable.  Enrico is trying 
	to jolly him up.  The Countess enters in a very 
	mysterious way, sits beside them and tells them 
	with much glee but in great secretiveness that 
	she has great news.  She stealthily draws the 
	paper from her dress and shows it to them. 

INSERT--SAME CLAUSE AS BEFORE WITH THE 
	COUNTESS' FINGER POINTING TO IT. 

	   Conwell and Enrico are puzzled over this, and 
	Conwell asks the Countess how it concerns him. 
	The Countess looks furtively about and says: 

SP:	"DON'T YOU SEE--IF HE LOSES MONEY 
	FOR THE COMPANY, HE LOSES THE 
	FORTUNE AND THE GIRL!" 

	   Enrico and Conwell consider this for a moment, 
	and finally realize the truth of it but ask the 
	Countess what she has in her bean. The Countess 
	looks furtively about and says:

SP:	"WE'LL HAVE HIM INSURE THE LIVES 
	OF THE KING AND COUNCIL." 

	   Enrico and Conwell look at her, then at each
  	other and ask what good that will do.  The
	Countess looks at them in a surprised way and 
	says:

SP: 	"AREN'T THEY ALL TO BE KILLED IN 
	OUR REVOLUTION?" 

	   Slowly the force of this breaks over the minds
	of Enrico and Conwell, their faces become 
	wreathed in smiles, at length both laugh boisterously.  
	Conwell takes the paper and looks at it 
	again, then rises, takes his glass, holds it out 
	toward the Countess and says:

SP:	"TO THE WOMEN--BLESS THEM. WHAT 
	WOULD WE DO WITHOUT THEM?" 

	   He and Enrico raise their glasses and drink
	to the Countess who smiles and blushes.  (Fade
	out.) 

T:	THE NEXT MORNING--THE PLANT. 

74.	FRONT OF THE HOTEL. (Fade in.) Roland 
	is sitting at a table in the f.g. having his 
	breakfast.  Conwell and Enrico come to the hotel 
	doorway and look out. They finally spot Roland. 
	Conwell then gives instructions to Enrico as to 
	what to do.  He then goes out toward Roland 
	while Enrico backs into the hotel doorway and
	waits.  Conwell goes over to Roland, slaps him 
	on the back, greets him heartily.  Roland rises,
	rather embarrassed, Conwell shakes his hand 
	cordially and sits beside him.  Enrico in the 
	doorway watches with a sinister smile.  Conwell 
	asks Roland what he is doing down in Bunkonia. 
	Roland says:

SP: 	"I'VE COME DOWN TO SELL INSURANCE." 

	   Conwell is interested in this and Roland tells 
	him in a few words what he wants to do. Conwell 
	is quite interested and says:

SP:	"PERHAPS I CAN GIVE YOU A BOOST. I 
	KNOW ALL THE BIG GUNS DOWN HERE." 

	   Roland is mildly interested but not overly 
	enthusiastic as he knows something of Conwell's 
	boasting proclivities.  However he thanks him. 
	Conwell offers Roland a cigarette and while Roland 
	is taking it, Conwell quickly signals to 
	Enrico.  Enrico sees the signal and walks down
	to the front of the hotel.  Conwell looks up
	sharply, pretending he has just seen Enrico, 
	points him out to Roland, who looks also, and 
	Conwell then speaks, saying:

SP:	"THAT'S ENRICO DE CASTANET, 
	SECRETARY OF WAR, AND A GREAT PAL OF 
	KING CARAMBA."
   
	   Roland is quite impressed.  Conwell says he
 	will bring him over and gets up and goes over
	toward Enrico.  Enrico turns, sees him, greets
	him very enthusiastically, saying, "Ah, my 
	friend," shakes his hand and raises his hat at
	the same time Conwell is doing it.  Conwell
	then asks him if he won't come over and meet 
	his friend, at the same time giving Enrico the 
	wink.  Enrico says he will be pleased and they 
	both go over to Roland's table.  Conwell 
	introduces Enrico to Roland.  Enrico again 
	raises his hat.  They all sit, Roland orders
	drinks and Conwell briefly tells Enrico about 
	Roland's  business.  Enrico says he is interested 
	in any friend of Conwell's and after a 
	few words of explanation from Roland, Enrico 
	says to Conwell:

SP: 	"THERE'S A MEETING OF THE COUNCIL 
	TO-NIGHT.  WHY NOT BRING YOUR 
	FRIEND?  I'LL HAVE HIM MEET THE 
	KING." 

	   Roland is quite overcome by all this kindness, 
	and Conwell says:  "That is exactly the thing to 
	do."  Conwell takes his drink, holds it up and
	says:

SP:	"HERE'S HOPING YOU INSURE THE 
	LIVES OF THE KING AND ALL HIS 
	COUNCIL." 

	   They all drink to Roland's success. Roland is 
	overcome by their kindness.  (Fade out.) 

T:	AT THE COUNCIL MEETING.

75.	KING CARAMBA'S COUNCIL ROOM. (Fade 
	in.)  King Caramba and his councilors are there,
 	boozing as usual.  Conwell is standing making a
	speech to them which they are not listening to 
	very intently.  Conwell is telling them what a 
	great thing insurance is, and says: 

SP:	"RIGHT AT YOUR VERY DOOR, GENTLEMEN, 
	IS A YOUNG YANKEE WHO IS 
	ABLE TO SELL YOU THIS WONDERFUL 
	LIFE INSURANCE." 

	   The councilors listen in a drunken way, all 
	except old Señor Frijole, who is very sore and
	grouchy and signifies that he wants nothing to 
	do with this Yankee and his business.  Enrico
	rises to speak, telling them what a wonderful
	thing insurance is, and then he says: 

SP:	"WHY, DO YOU REALIZE, GENTLEMEN, 
	THAT WE GET THOUSANDS OF PESETAS 
	FOR A MERE FEW HUNDRED?" 

	   He turns to Conwell and asks him if he is right. 
	Conwell assures him he is right, and then continues 
	his speech.  At this the Councilors begin
	to take very much more interest.  They signify 
	that this must be very good after all, all except 
	old Señor Frijole, who is sitting next to Enrico. 
	He pulls Enrico's sleeve and says:

SP:	"BUT YOU HAVE TO DIE TO GET IT--
	DON'T YOU?" 

	   Enrico gives him a quick, dirty look, tells him 
	to shut up, which squelches him somewhat, but 
	he goes on mumbling to himself.  Conwell goes 
	on talking, saying that this opportunity should
	not be overlooked.  He sits down.  Enrico says
	he thinks it is a fine idea and says: 

SP:	"I'LL TAKE 10,000 PESETAS MYSELF."

	   At this the councilors are more interested 
	than ever as they know Enrico is not the type 
	to be done.  Old Frijole goes on grumbling into 
	his glass of liquor saying he will have nothing 
	to do with it.  Conwell goes over to the door, 
	opens it and goes out. 

76.	HALLWAY IN PALACE.  Roland sitting on a 
	settee. Conwell comes from Council Room.  
	Roland with application in his hand jumps up 
	nervously and meets him.  Conwell tells him it 
	is all right and they go into Council Room. 

77.	COUNCIL ROOM.  Conwell brings Roland in
	and introduces him to the councilors who greet 
	him with drunken enthusiasm, while Conwell 
	stands in the background with a menacing leer. 
	Roland is very much pleased, but bashful, overcome 
	by his luck. Enrico, with a grand flourish, 
	asks Roland for an application which Roland 
	gives him, and he signs his own application with 
	a grand flourish and hands it over to Roland 
	as if to say--"There, what more assurance do
	you want that this is a good thing?"  At this
	the other councilors all reach out drunkenly and 
	grab applications, Roland writing in the amounts, 
	and all of them signing the duplications drunkenly.   
	Enrico and Conwell exchange triumphant
 	looks, but old Señor Frijole shows his disgust 
	for the entire affair.  He finally goes up and 
	tries to keep the King from signing his application, 
	but the King gives him a push, he staggers 
	back into his chair, mumbling and grumbling 
	and warning them against Yankee tricks. By this 
	time, Roland has most of the applications signed, 
	Conwell comes up, pats him on the back and 
	congratulates him.  (Fade out.) 

T:	ABOUT A WEEK LATER. (Fade in.) 

78.	COLONEL BIRD'S ROOM IN CONSULATE. 
	Rosalie in simple evening dress is standing by 
	the window.  Roland, in a blue coat and flannel 
	trousers, rushes in and Rosalie runs to him.  He
	tells her he has a surprise for her.   She is very
	much interested and wants to know what it is. 
	He says:

SP:	"I'VE INSURED KING CARAMBA AND HIS 
	COUNCILORS FOR NEARLY A HUNDRED 
	THOUSAND DOLLARS." 

	   Rosalie is amazed and delighted at this good 
	news.  Roland says:

SP:	"I JUST DELIVERED THE POLICIES AND 
	COLLECTED THE PREMIUMS." 

	   Rosalie is in ecstasies and throws her arm 
	around him and kisses him, much to his 
	embarrassment, although he is also greatly pleased. 
	Roland says:

SP:	"I WANT YOU TO COME OUT TO HELP 
	CELEBRATE MY GOOD FORTUNE."
 
	   She is delighted, picks up a tulle scarf and 
	goes out with Roland.

79. 	CONWELL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Conwell 
	is standing at desk as Roland and Rosalie
	enter.   Conwell turns to them smiling.   Roland
	stops and tells Rosalie Conwell's influence got 
	him his big clients.  He goes to Conwell and 
	thanks him, shaking his hand.  Rosalie is 
	surprised and puzzled that Conwell should help
	Roland.  Roland gets Rosalie and they go out 
	bidding  Conwell  good-night.  Conwell  looks 
	after them leering. 

80.	EXTERIOR CONSULATE. Roland and Rosalie 
	come out of the Consulate and leave in the
	direction  of the hotel.

81.	REVOLUTIONISTS' RENDEZVOUS.  The
	Countess, three other Revolutionists and about
 	thirty soldiers are there.  They are all excited
	and talking among themselves.

82.	GATEWAY OF RENDEZVOUS. General enters 
	hurriedly and knocks three times--gate opens
	and he quickly enters.
 
83.	REVOLUTIONISTS' RENDEZVOUS.  Revolutionists 
	talking and awaiting somebody.   The
	general enters and joins group.  He looks about
	and says:

SP: 	"ENRICO HAS JUST LEFT THE COUNCIL
	MEETING. AS SOON AS HE COMES WE
	STRIKE." 
 
 	   He then leaves and goes to soldiers--the others
	discuss this news excitedly.

84.	GATEWAY OF RENDEZVOUS. A group of 
	six or eight soldiers, led by a sergeant, approach
	skulkingly--the sergeant knocks at the gate
	which opens and the soldiers all sneak in.

85.	EXTERIOR CONSULATE.  Colonel enters 
	from opposite direction taken by Roland and 
	Rosalie and enters consulate.  Four guards look 
	out from hiding places.

86.	CAFE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL (NIGHT).  
	Several people at tables.  Roland 
	and Rosalie enter and go into one of the little 
	booths and sit down--waiter comes and takes 
	their order--they are very happy.
 
87.	EXTERIOR CONSULATE.  Enrico enters, 
	whistles softly, and four guards sneak out of 
	hiding places and come to him.  He asks if Colonel 
	Bird is home.  They tell him he has just 
	gone in.  He tells them to wait in the shadow 
	and they go into the shadow and Enrico, looking 
	about cautiously, goes to the porch and knocks 
	three times.

88. 	CONWELL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Conwell 
	at desk hears knock, glances toward the 
	colonel's room and goes to the door, opens it. 
	Enrico quickly enters.  Conwell closes the door. 
	Enrico asks him if the Colonel is in.  He smiles
 	and says yes. Enrico tells him he has come to fix
 	old Bird.  Conwell says:  "Easy--he'll do anything 
	you say," and tells him to wait a moment 
	and goes into the Colonel's room.

89.	COLONEL'S ROOM.  Colonel at his desk. 
	Conwell enters, tells him that Enrico de Castanet
 	wishes to see him.  Colonel somewhat surprised
 	and a little bit flattered, swells up a bit, tells 
	Conwell to show Señor de Castanet in.  Conwell opens 
	the door and de Castanet enters.  The Colonel
 	greets him and they sit down and Conwell goes out 
	and they begin to talk, Enrico telling him that 
	they are going to pull a revolution that night 
	and put King Caramba and his council out of
 	the way.
 
90.	CAFE IN FRONT OF HOTEL. Roland and 
	Rosalie still dining, having a grand time. A couple 
	of revolutionists enter and sit in the booth next 
	to theirs.

91. 	COLONEL'S ROOM.  Enrico is talking very 
	earnestly to the Colonel.  At length he says: 

SP:	"NOW IF YOU WILL ADVISE THE AMERICAN 
	PRESIDENT TO RECOGNIZE OUR 
	NEW GOVERNMENT TO-MORROW, IT 
	WILL MEAN ALMOST ANYTHING YOU 
	WISH TO ASK." 

	   The old Colonel is puzzled and vaguely alarmed 
	at this, doesn't quite get it.  Asks Enrico: 

SP:	"ARE YOU OFFERING ME A BRIBE?" 

	   Enrico shrugs his shoulders and says if that 
	is what he chooses to call it.  The old Colonel
	becomes very angry, rises at his desk, begins to 
	lay down the law to Enrico and says: 

SP: 	"YOU WOULD HAVE ME BARTER THE 
	HONOR OF MY COUNTRY? ARE YOU 
	AWARE, SIR, THAT YOU ARE DEALING 
	WITH A LOYAL AMERICAN CITIZEN?" 

	   He bangs the table, stretches himself to his 
	full height.  Enrico rises and tries to argue with 
	him, but the Colonel brushes him away and
	grandiloquently points to American flag. 

SP:	"THAT, SIR, IS THE GREATEST FLAG IN 
	THE WORLD AND NO ACT OF MINE 
	SHALL EVER STAIN IT." 

	   At the finish of the speech, the old Colonel, 
	with a grand flourish, orders Enrico out of the 
	room. Enrico backs out, protesting all the way. 
	The old man kicking him out at the finish. 

92.	CONWELL'S OFFICE.  Conwell waiting 
	expectantly.  Enrico lands in the room, to which he 
	has been catapulted by the old Colonel's foot. 
	Conwell comes to him, much perturbed.

	Old Colonel slams the door and walks up and 
	down in excitement.
 
94.	CONWELL'S  ROOM.  Enrico angrily telling
	Conwell what happened in the other room.  Conwell 
	very sore and disgusted at the old man, 
	says:
 
SP: 	"HAVE YOUR GUARD KIDNAP HIM AND
	LOCK HIM UP AND I'LL TAKE CHARGE 
	OF THE CONSULATE.
   
	   Enrico angrily approves of this and rushes 
	outdoors.

95. 	COLONEL'S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Colonel  
	at his desk, rapidly writing a telegram,
	presses button.

	looking out hears the button, goes into the 
	Colonel's room.

97. 	COLONEL'S ROOM AT CONSULATE. Colonel 
	finishing telegram, rises.  Conwell comes to 
	him.  Colonel indignantly tells him in a very
 	few words what has happened, points to the flag,
 	hammers his chest in great indignation, shows
	him a telegram which he is sending.  Conwell 
	reads telegram:
 
INSERT--TELEGRAM.

	TO CAPT. HENRY HALYARD, U. S. BATTLESHIP 
	UTAH, PORTO PUNKO, BUNKONIA.
 
	REVOLUTION THREATENED HERE TO-
 	NIGHT.  SEND MARINES AT ONCE TO
	PROTECT AMERICAN INTERESTS. 

			BIRD,
			CONSUL. 

	   Conwell smiles at this. The Colonel orders him 
	to send it at once and Conwell, still smiling, 
	starts to leave the room, when the door opens 
	and in bursts Enrico with his four guards.  He 
	tells them to arrest the Colonel, which they do, 
	but the old boy puts up a fight.  They finally 
	overcome him and hold him prisoner.  He appeals 
	to Conwell, who only laughs at him and 
	tears up the telegram and throws it in his face, 
	shakes his finger at the old man and says: 

SP:	"WE SHALL SEE NOW WHO IS THE BOSS 
	AROUND HERE." 

	   The old Colonel is annoyed and tries to get 
	at Conwell but the guards hold him.  Conwell 
	smiles and says:

SP:	"WE SHALL SEE NOW WHETHER I GET 
	YOUR DAUGHTER OR NOT." 

	   He tells the guard to rush the old man out, 
	which they do, followed by Conwell and Enrico. 

98.	CONWELL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE.  The 
	guards rush the old Colonel through the room 
	and out, followed by Conwell and Enrico.

	the old Colonel out followed by Enrico and 
	Conwell.  Enrico tells the guard:

SP:	"LOCK HIM UP IN THE DUNGEONS 
	UNDER THE PALACE." 

	   He scribbles on a card that he gives to one 
	of the guards.  The guards rush the Colonel off 
	toward the palace and Enrico and Conwell go 
	in the opposite direction, toward the rendezvous. 

100.	CAFE IN FRONT OF HOTEL. (Long shot) 
	showing the two booths, with Roland and Rosalie
	in one and the two revolutionists in the other. 

CLOSE UP OF TABLE WITH ROLAND AND ROSALIE.  
	They are talking animatedly.  Roland
	has a little notebook in his hand, which he shows 
	to Rosalie and says:
 
SP:	"THINK WHAT THIS MEANS TO US, ROSALIE! 
	I CAN'T FAIL NOW." 

	   Rosalie is delighted at the wonder of this--
	takes his hand and they go on talking of their 
	plans.
 
CLOSE UP OF THE TABLE WITH THE REVOLUTIONISTS. 
	A third revolutionist officer comes 
	in hurriedly, sits down, looks about and says: 

SP:	"THE HOUR TO STRIKE IS AT HAND." 

	The other revolutionists listen.

CLOSE UP OF ROLAND AND ROSALIE. 
	They are pricking up their ears.
 
CLOSE UP OF REVOLUTIONISTS' TABLE. 
	One asks the newcomer what is going to happen 
	and he says:
 
SP:	"THE REVOLUTION STARTS TO-NIGHT." 

	The other two gloat over this.

CLOSE UP--Roland and Rosalie listen, their alarm 
	growing, Roland climbs on chair and looks into 
	next booth.

OTHER BOOTH--Roland looking over top, frightened. 
	The revolutionists go on talking, the newcomer
	says:

SP:	"KING CARAMBA AND HIS COUNCIL
	WILL BE KILLED FIRST." 

	They go on talking together.

CLOSE UP, ROLAND AND ROSALIE--Roland is dismayed 
	at what he has heard.  Rosalie starts to 
	speak and he tells her to keep quiet and he listens 
	over the partition.

CLOSE UP, THREE REVOLUTIONISTS--They are 
	talking, call waiter, pay him and get up and 
	leave hurriedly.  Roland ducks down. 

CLOSE UP OF ROLAND--Finally he realizes what is 
	to happen, and that it means ruin and he turns 
	to Rosalie and says:

SP:	"THEY ARE GOING TO KILL EVERY ONE 
	I'VE INSURED." 

	They are both terribly alarmed and realize
 	that this means ruin for their hopes.  They don't
	know what to do, at length Rosalie says: 

SP:	"WE MUST HAVE FATHER SEND FOR HELP." 

	   Roland in his terror agrees to this--he throws 
	a bill on the table, she grabs him by the hand and 
	they rush out.

101.	EXTERIOR  REVOLUTIONISTS' RENDEZVOUS--
	Enrico and Conwell  enter.  Enrico 
	knocks on door three times, the door is opened 
	and they enter.
 
102.	REVOLUTIONISTS' RENDEZVOUS.  Enrico 
	and Conwell enter and join Countess and General 
	and tell them the time has come to strike--that 
	old Bird refused Enrico's request, that they 
	chucked him in prison and Conwell now is boss 
	of the Consulate.

	and Rosalie rush in--see the overturned

	Mammy enters from back door.  Rosalie runs to 
	her and asks what has happened and she doesn't 
	know. Rosalie asks Mammy where her father is. 
	Mammy says she left him here. Rosalie is terrified. 
	Rosalie and the old servant rush out.   Rosalie 
	upstairs and Mammy to kitchen to look for 
	the Colonel.  Roland picks up the bits of the 
	telegram from the floor and pieces them together. 
	Rosalie comes back into the room and the old 
	servant enters and shakes her head.  Rosalie in
	terror, says:

SP:	"FATHER IS NOT HERE."

	   Roland thinks a moment, realizes that they have 
	taken him away, shows his anger at this, calls 
	Rosalie to him, finishes piecing the telegram 
	together and then reads it.

INSERT OF TELEGRAM PIECED TOGETHER.
 
	   Rosalie having read the telegram shows hope 
	in her face and says to Roland:
 
SP:	"YOU MUST SEND THAT MESSAGE AT ONCE." 

	   Roland jumps at this and gathers up the pieces 
	in his hand, starts  to go, then thinks of the 
	girl, stops and asks her what she will do in the
	meantime.  She says never to mind, but to go on,
	old Mammy will stay with her.  Roland is reluctant 
	to go, but Rosalie goes to the drawer of the 
	desk, takes out her father's old army revolver, 
	and then goes to Roland and says: 

SP:	"I AM AN AMERICAN GIRL AND CAN
	TAKE CARE OF MYSELF." 

	   She tells him to go and forces him out toward
	the door.  He takes her in his arms and kisses
	her and rushes out.  The old mammy comes to 
	her and puts her arm about her.

107.	FRONT OF CONSULATE--Roland rushes out 
	and down the street toward the station. 

108.	REVOLUTIONISTS' RENDEZVOUS.  The
 	Countess, the General and a few other officers,
 	about 100 soldiers and a major are there.  Enrico
 	is giving his instructions to the various people. 
	Conwell and Enrico enter.  Conwell tells Countess, 
	General and others what has happened and
 	tells them what to do.  Conwell says: 

SP:	"LOOK HERE, WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL? 
	I WANT HER ABDUCTED AND KEPT FOR 
	ME IN THE PALACE."

	   Enrico says that's all right--tells the general
	to put a guard at the disposal of Conwell. Conwell 
	and the general leave--go to soldiers.  Enrico tells
	Countess to look after the girl when 
	she gets to the palace.  Countess says she will
	and Enrico goes on talking to others.
 
	   About 100 soldiers are there.  Conwell and
 	General enter.  General selects a guard of about
	three men.  Tells them to obey Conwell's orders 
	and Conwell leaves with the three men.  The
	General then turns to the rest of the soldiers
	instructing them as to what they are to do.

109.	EXTERIOR R. R. STATION.  Roland runs in
	and enters station.

110.	INTERIOR R. R. STATION AND TELEGRAPH OFFICE. 
	Roland rushes in and tells 
	station master he wants to send a message. Starts
	to write it.  Station master stops him--says he 
	cannot send message.  Roland asks why.  Station
 	master points to telegraph instrument. 

CLOSE UP OF TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT SMASHED.

	   Roland asks who did that. Station master says:

	   Roland is nonplused for the moment--rushes 
	out of the door, followed by the station master. 

111.	EXTERIOR R. R. STATION.  Roland rushes
	out followed by station master.  Roland runs in
	the direction of the hotel.  Station master looks

112.	EXTERIOR  WINDOW  SIDE OF CONSULATE. 
	Conwell sneaks in with his three soldiers 
	and peeks in window and sees--

113.	COL. BIRD'S ROOM IN CONSULATE--Rosalie 
	sitting tense holding gun and  watching
	door.  Mammy beside her standing. 

114.	EXTERIOR  WINDOW  SIDE OF CONSULATE.  
	Conwell shows his chagrin at the fact 
	of Rosalie's having a gun, thinks a moment, then
	tells his guard to keep very quiet and follow
	him.  He sneaks out toward front of house, 
	followed by guard very quietly.

115.	CAFE IN FRONT OF HOTEL.  Tom is sitting
	in one of the booths shooting craps with a 
	native civilian.  Roland rushes in, tells Tom about 
	the revolution, says:
 
SP: 	"WE'VE GOT TO SAVE ALL THOSE GINKS
	I INSURED." 

	   He grabs Tom and they rush out of the cafe 
	toward the palace leaving the native flat. 

116.	CONWELL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Conwell, 
	with his three guards, enter stealthily. He
	places the three guards against the wall on each 
	side of the door leading to the Colonel's room 
	and he then knocks on the door.

117.	COLONEL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE.  Rosalie, 
	terrified, says: "Who is it?"
 
118.	CONWELL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE.  Conwell 
	says, "It's I -- Jim Conwell." 

119.	COLONEL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE.  Rosalie, 
	greatly relieved, lowers gun and says, "come 
	in."  Conwell enters, leaving the door open.  He
 	smiles ingratiatingly and comes forward.   She
 	asks him if he knows where her father is.  He 
	doesn't know, but pats her reassuringly on the 
	shoulder and gently takes the revolver from her. 
	In this position he whistles.  The girl looks up 
	quickly and jumps to her feet in alarm, but before 
	she can make any move, the three guards rush
	in and seize her.  Conwell steps to her and says: 

SP:	"DON'T BE ALARMED, THESE GENTLEMEN 
	WILL ESCORT YOU TO THE KING'S 
	PALACE WHERE OUR WEDDING WILL 
	TAKE PLACE TO-MORROW MORNING." 

	   Rosalie is horrified at this and starts to struggle, 
	but the men hold her and start to take her out of
	the room.  The old Mammy grabs a big book
	and lambasts Conwell over the head, stunning 
	him for a moment. She then runs for the guards, 
	jumping on their backs like a cat.  By this time 
	Conwell has regained his feet, grabs the colored 
	servant and bangs her on the head with something 
	heavy, then chucks her over into a corner 
	and he follows the guards and Rosalie out 
	through a back door.

120.	BACK DOOR OF CONSULATE.  Conwell 
	rushes out followed by the three guards dragging
	Rosalie.   They start toward palace but Conwell
	stops them and says:
 
SP:	"WE'LL KEEP HER IN OUR RENDEZVOUS 
	UNTIL ENRICO CAPTURES THE PALACE." 

	   They all exit in the opposite direction. 

121.	REVOLUTIONISTS' RENDEZVOUS. Enrico 
	is there with the General, Major and Countess. 
	Enrico is haranguing the soldiers, giving them 
	final instructions.  They all cheer.  Enrico calls 
	Major to him and tells him to look after the 
	Countess and after they have captured the palace 
	to bring her there.  Major salutes and steps aside
	with Countess.  Enrico goes on haranguing the 
	soldiers and at length says:

SP:	"AND REMEMBER THERE IS A PRICE
	OF THIRTY PESETAS ON THE HEAD OF
	THE KING!" 

	   They all cheer.  Enrico draws his sword and
	says:

SP:	"ON TO THE PALACE!" 

	   He gives orders to fall in, which they do, 
	then forward march.  They all march out led by 
	Enrico, the Countess and Major looking after
	them.

T:	THIRTY PESETAS' WORTH OF ROYALTY. 

122.	KING'S BEDCHAMBER. Councilors standing 
	by bed all salute drunkenly.  Two lackeys carry 
	the King (who is dressed in a long white night 
	gown and night cap and hugging a bottle of 
	booze to his chest) and chuck him on the bed,
	cover him up and stand.  The king dozes off
	into a drunken  stupor.  Councilors salute and 
	stagger out toward Council Room (followed by
	lackeys).

123.	HALLWAY IN PALACE.  Councilors 
	stagger out of  King's bedroom across hall and into

124.	COUNCIL ROOM IN PALACE. Councilors 
	stagger in and sit at table and begin boozing--

125.	FRONT DOOR OF PALACE. Two royal 
	guards on duty (uniforms elaborate and different 
	from those of the army).  Roland and Tom rush
 	up and demand admittance and are refused.  Roland 
	says it is very important to see the king, 
	but they won't let him in.  Tom wants to wallop 
	them on the nose and go in, but is restrained by 
	their guns and finally he and Roland leave in 
	disgust and go down to the edge of the grounds, 
	then look back and see the guards are not looking 
	and beat it around to the side of the palace.

	pushes it open and crawls in. He then pulls Tom
	up after him.

130.	HALLWAY OF PALACE.  LOOKING TOWARD 
	THE BACK. Roland and Tom crawl 
	in the window, quickly look about, rush into the 
	Council Room.
 
131.	COUNCIL CHAMBER.  Councilors all drunk. 
	Tom and Roland rush in from hall, tell them
 	there is a revolution on and they've got to beat
 	it to save their hides as the soldiers and 
	revolutionists are coming.   They all get up in a 
	drunken, stupid sort of way--don't take it in. 
	Two lackeys rush out the window at back. Roland 
	demands of one of the councilors: 

SP:	"WHERE IS THE KING?" 

	   The councilor, half soused, points across the 
	hall.  Roland and Tom  stir up the councilors
	and drive them out into the hall.  One of them is 
	too far gone to walk.  Roland pitches him over
	to Tom who throws him over his shoulder and 
	carries him out.  Little Frijole, the grouch, is the
	soberest of the lot and realizes the situation and
	tries to follow along, but Roland gives him a 
	shove and lands him in a chair, saying: 

SP:	"GET AWAY! YOU'RE NOT INSURED."

	   They all go out into the hall, Frijole getting up 
	and following.  As he does so, he draws an old 
	revolver out of his pocket.

132.	HALLWAY IN THE PALACE.  They all cross 
	the hallway to the king's bedroom--Tom carrying 
	his councilor, Frijole following, waving his 
	revolver.

133.	KING'S BEDROOM.  They all rush in Tom 
	carrying the same councilor and Frijole waving 
	his revolver.  Roland  rushes  to the king's bed 
	and wakes him up while the councilors stagger 
	about stupidly, bumping into each other and not
 	yet fully realizing what's up.  Tom drops his 
	councilor on a couch or floor. Roland wakes 
	the king up--pulls him out of bed--tells him 
	that the revolutionists are coming and he has
	got to get out.  The King is very stupid from
	drink and doesn't take it in.  Roland shakes him 
	and tries to make him understand.

134.	STREET CORNER NEARER THE PALACE. 
	Enrico, the General and army march through. 

135.	KING'S  BEDROOM.  Roland, trying to make

CLOSE UP OF LITTLE PRIVATE SIDEBOARD OR BAR 
	in corner of room.  Tom rushes in, looks 
	for water but there is none.  He turns and says: 

SP:	"EVERYTHING HERE BUT WATAH!"

	   Roland says to bring a bottle of something. 
	Tom takes a bottle of champagne, knocks neck 
	off of it and goes toward bed.

CLOSE UP BY BED--Roland still trying to bring King 
	to.  Tom enters with champagne.  Roland takes 
	it and souses it in  King's face--King falls back 
	on bed.  Roland and Tom pull him up again to 
	his feet.  King licks champagne from his face
	with tongue.  They punch, pummel and slap him
	and finally bring him to. Roland tells him about 
	the revolution--that they must get out of the 
	palace and hide.  The King looks around and 
	sees the various councilors.  Finally realizes what 
	is up -- asks where the Revolutionists are. 

136.	FRONT OF PALACE. Two royal guards sleeping 
	on ground.  Enrico, General and soldiers 
	march in.  Royal guards are overpowered and
	Enrico, General and soldiers begin to bang on
	door.

137.	KING'S BEDROOM. IN PALACE.  Roland
	tells him they are rushing on the Palace.   The
	old King is scared blue--begins to shake and
	tremble.   Roland asks him if he doesn't know
	some way to get out. Finally the old King comes 
	to his senses enough to remember a trap door
	under the flagging of the floor.  He takes Roland
	over to the place in the floor and points down there.
 	Roland and Tom look and see nothing but flagging.  
	The old King keeps pointing and poking
	with his toe, says:

SP:	"STAIRWAY UNDER THERE."
 
  	   Finally Roland taps the flagging with his heel. 
	Then he and Tom get down on their knees and
 	try to pull up the stone.  It won't come.  They
 	look up at the King.  He says, yes, that's the 
	place.

SP:	"TUNNEL -- LEADS TO EL JUGGO PRISON." 

	   Tom then gets a big jack-knife from his pocket, 
	opens it and begins to pry up the flagging.  The
	old King claps his hands and nods his head. 
	Roland and Tom continue pulling up the flagging 
	from the floor.
 
138.	FRONT OF THE PALACE.   Enrico, the General 
	and soldiers banging on the door. 

139.	THE KING'S BEDROOM.  Roland finishes 
	pulling up the last stone. Tom chucks the stones

	banging on the door trying to break it down. 

141.	THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER.  Roland is 
	shooing the King and Councilors down the stairway. 
	Frijole keeps butting in and Roland pushing 
	him back.

CLOSE UP OF THE STAIRWAY. Frijole is trying to 
	push himself down, but Roland holds him back 
	and says:

SP:	"I TOLD YOU TO KEEP OUT OF THIS--
	YOU'RE NOT INSURED." 

	   But Frijole insists that he shall go and raises
	his revolver at Roland.  Roland ducks and knocks
	the revolver out of his hand.  Tom picks it up. 
	Roland pushes Frijole over to Tom, who picks 
	up the little man and drops him out of the 
	window.
 
142.	FRONT OF PALACE.  Soldiers still banging 
	on the door--door breaks through and they enter.

	runs to door to hall, opens it a crack and peeks 
	out.

	Enrico.  Roland stops him and says: 

SP:	"FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T KILL HIM. 
	HE'S INSURED FOR TEN THOUSAND 
	DOLLARS." 

	   He grabs Tom, closes the door and locks it, 
	pulls Tom away.
 
148.	HALLWAY.  Enrico, with a flourish, leads his 
	men down the hall toward the King's bedroom. 

149.	KING'S BEDROOM.   Tom picks up his councilor  
	and starts down through trap with him. 
	Roland quickly removing traces of the broken 
	floor, takes a rug and pulls it to the back of the 
	trap door.

150.	HALLWAY OF PALACE.  Enrico and part of 
	his soldiers are beating down the door of the 
	King's chamber--the rest going to the council 
	chamber.
 
151.	KING'S BEDCHAMBER.  He closes the trap 
	just as the door breaks open and Enrico rushes 
	in with his soldiers.  Enrico rushes to the bed, 
	sees the King is gone, looks angrily all about
	the room, points toward the council  chamber
	and they all rush out.

152.	COUNCIL CHAMBER.   Soldiers with General 
	looking about coming in from door leading to 
	other rooms where they have found nothing. 
	Enrico enters, followed by soldiers, discovers 
	there is nobody there.  He meets the General 
	and they are much puzzled as to who could have 
	tipped off the King and let him escape.  The 
	General shrugs his shoulders, says if they have 
	escaped, Enrico  can proclaim himself dictator. 
	Enrico goes to the head of the council table, the 
	General on his right raising his sword and 
	shouting:
 
SP: 	"THE KING AND COUNCIL HAVING
	FLED, SENOR DE CASTANET PROCLAIMS 
	HIMSELF DICTATOR OF BUNKONIA!" 

	   Soldiers wave their hats, officers their swords, 
	and all acclaim him dictator.  He starts to make 
	a speech and says:

SP:	"GENERAL, OUR FIRST MOVE MUST BE
	TO CAPTURE AND SHOOT OUR RENEGADE 
	KING AND HIS COUNCIL." 

	   The General approves and calls an officer and
	tells him to take a troop and go after the King. 
	Officer leaves.

	beating on the door.
 
157.	HALLWAY OF JAIL.  The guard, amazed at 
	hearing the noise outside this door, gets up, 
	unlocks the big lock and opens the door.  Roland
	rushes in with the King on his arm, followed
	by the four Councilors, Tom carrying one.   The
	guard is dumbfounded at seeing all these notables 
	coming through the tunnel and asks what the 
	trouble is.  Roland tells him there is a revolution.
 	He looks closely at the King, realizes who it is,
	drops to his knees and kisses the King's hand.
	Roland pulls him up to his feet and says:
 
SP:	"I WANT YOU TO LOCK THIS WHOLE 
	GANG UP UNTIL I CAN GET HELP!" 

	   The guard looks at Roland then at the King 
	and says:
 
SP:	"LOCK UP MY KING--NEVER!"
 
	   He then kneels down and kisses the king's
	hand.  Roland again pulls him to his feet, takes
	him aside and gives him a couple of pesetas.
	The guard says, "Sure, that's all right," grabs 
	the King and hustles him and others down corridor, 
	Tom carrying his councilor.  Roland tells 
	Tom to stay with them. Tom follows them down 
	the corridor and Roland beats it out of the front 
	of the jail.

	about.  Countess enters with Colonel, Conwell,
	Rosalie and guards.  Countess is escorted by 
	Colonel to Enrico, who kisses her hand and steps 
	over to Rosalie, who is with Conwell.  She is 
	terribly frightened but Enrico leers at her and 
	tells her she has nothing to fear.  Then turns to 
	the party and says:

SP:	"LET US DRINK TO OUR LITTLE BRIDE."

	   They all take glasses. Conwell raises glass to 
	Rosalie and says:

SP:	"TO-MORROW AT TEN."

	   They all drink to Rosalie, who stands shivering 
	pitifully.  (Quick fade out.)

T:	TOO LATE.

160.	EXTERIOR  CONSULATE.  Roland runs in 
	and rushes in the Consulate.

161.	COLONEL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE--Old 
	mammy lying unconscious where Conwell had 
	thrown her.  Roland rushes in, is alarmed at 
	seeing the girl gone.  He goes to mammy, raises 
	her up, shakes her, rubs her hands and slaps them, 
	trying to bring her to.

162.	STREET.  Tom runs through desperately. 

163.	COLONEL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE.   Roland 
	is giving mammy a drink of water.  She
 	opens her eyes and slowly comes to.  He puts
 	her in a chair and asks her what has happened. 
	She pulls herself together and says that Conwell 
	was there with soldiers--says: 

SP:	"THEY TOOK HER TO THE KING'S PALACE! 
	THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE HER 
	MARRY CONWELL IN THE MORNING!" 

	   Roland shows his alarm and anger, is stumped
	for a moment.  The old mammy begs him to save 
	her girl.  Roland thinks for a minute what is best
 	to do.
 
164.	FRONT OF CONSULATE. Tom runs in and 
	rushes into the house.

165.	COLONEL'S ROOM IN CONSULATE. Roland 
	is still talking to old mammy, who is describing 
	what happened.  Tom rushes in from Conwell's 
	room, rushes to Roland and all out of 
	breath points hand and says:

SP:	"THE REVOLUTIONISTS PAID THE JAIL 
	GUARD TEN PEZITS AND HE TURNED 
	OVER THE KING AND HIS WHOLE GANG 
	TO THEM!"

	   Roland is in despair at this news.  Tom still
	panting, says:
 
SP:	"THEY ARE GOING TO SHOOT THEM 
	ALL IN THE MORNING!" 

	   Roland is utterly flabbergasted at this, looks 
	bewildered at Tom and the old mammy and
 	finally says to Tom that they have Rosalie in
 	the palace and are going to make her marry
 	Conwell.  Tom is open mouthed at this news.                       
 	At length Roland says:          

SP:	"THERE'S ONLY ONE CHANCE -- WE 
	MUST GO TO PORTO PUNKO AND GET 
	THE MARINES!" 

	   Tom and the old mammy are very much interested 
	in this and urge him to try it and Roland 
	asks mammy if she is all right.  She says she
	is and tells them to go on.  Tom and Roland 
	beat it out toward the front.  She looks after
	them.
 
166.	FRONT OF CONSULATE.  Roland and Tom
	come out and rush down the street toward the 
	station.

	soldiers bring in the King and four Councilors. 
	Tom's Councilor is being carried.  They chuck
	them in the cells and go out.  Col. Bird looking

	run in and quickly enter the station.

169.	INTERIOR R. R. STATION.  Roland and Tom
	rush in.  Roland asks the station master when
	the next train goes to Porto Punko.  Station 
	master laughs sardonically and replies: 

SP:	"NO TRAINS TO PORTO PUNKO TO-
	NIGHT!  THE REVOLUTION LEADERS 
	HAVE GIVEN ORDERS THAT NO ONE 
	SHALL LEAVE TOWN!" 

	   He laughs again at Tom and Roland. Roland 
	looks at Tom in alarm then asks the station master 
	if he is sure.  Station master says of course he's 
	sure.  Roland steps out of back door.  Tom starts 
	an altercation with the station master, telling him 
	he is too fresh, etc.

170.	EXTERIOR BACK OF STATION.  Roland 
	comes out and looks around in desperation. Sees 
	native riding by on an old bony horse, runs to him 
	and tries to hire horse.

	master's argument is getting warmer.  They are 
	threatening each other violently.

172.	EXTERIOR FRONT  R. R. STATION.   Two
	soldiers (officers with revolvers) ride up on hand
   	car, get off and run into station.

173.	INTERIOR R. R. STATION.  Tom is pounding 
	station master's head on counter as two officers
 	enter.  They see him, draw their revolvers and
 	shout, "Throw up your hands."  Tom stops 
	thumping station master and throws up his hands. 
	They make him turn toward front door and while 
	one covers him the other talks excitedly to station 
	master.

174.	EXTERIOR BACK OF R. R. STATION.  Roland 
	trying to bribe native to give him horse, but
	native refuses and rides off.  Roland turns and
	looks toward station and sees--

175.	INTERIOR R. R. STATION.   One of officers 
	covering Tom whose hands are up, the other 
	talking to station master.

176.	EXTERIOR BACK OF R. R. STATION.  Roland, 
	alarmed, runs to station.
 
177.	INTERIOR R. R. STATION.   Officer finishes 
	his talk with station master, covers Tom also and 
	they start to march him toward front door.  Roland 
	rushes in and fairly catapults himself on 
	the two officers, knocking them down.  Then he 
	and Tom rush out front door jumping over 
	officers.

178.	EXTERIOR  FRONT OF R. R. STATION.

180.	EXTERIOR FRONT OF R. R. STATION.

	rush out, see them and both fire at them. 
	Roland falls and Tom stops to help him.  The
	two officers run up to them followed by station 
	master.  They stick Tom up again and jerk Roland 
	to his feet.  Roland loses his hat and puts
 	his hand to his head.  He has only a scalp wound. 
	Two common soldiers run in from opposite direction--
	attracted by shots.  One of the officers says
	to them:

SP:	"TAKE THEM TO THE PALACE DUNGEON 
	AND LOCK THEM UP." 

	   The two soldiers start off with Roland and 
	Tom. The officer says, "wait a minute"--they 
	stop.  He speaks to the other officer who nods 
	his head.  The first officer then says to Tom: 

SP:	"YOU COME WITH US." 

	   He tells the two soldiers to take Roland off, 
	which they do. The two officers then march Tom 
	off to the hand car, followed by station master. 
	Arrived at the hand car one of them says to 
	Tom:
 
SP:	"GET ON THERE AND PUMP THAT CAR."

	   Tom and two officers get on hand car. Officers
	cover Tom with their revolvers.  The station
	master says:

SP:	"WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" 

	   One of the officers turns to him and says: 

SP:    "TO PORTO PUNKO." 

	   At this Tom's face lights up and he begins to
	pump like mad and the hand car goes down the 
	track in opposite direction to one of train in
	scene.   Station master waves his hand to them 
	and exits to station.  (Fade out.)
 
T:	NEXT MORNING.
 	THE FATAL HOUR APPROACHES. 

181.	PLAZA--FRONT OF PALACE. Soldiers are 
	lined up in front of palace.  Populace in native 
	costumes are running about talking excitedly and 
	reading placards which are posted all about.
 
INSERT--PLACARD (in fake language). 

		PROKLAMATIONIZ
	BINGUS DE SPOLIO KAYITZ! ETC. 

	DISSOLVE INTO ENGLISH WHICH READS: 

		PROCLAMATION 
	EX REX CARAMBA AND HIS COUNCIL
 	HAVE DESERTED THEIR PEOPLE. ENRICO 
	DE CASTANET HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED 
	DICTATOR BY UNANIMOUS 
	VOTE OF THE ARMY. CARAMBA AND
 	HIS COUNCIL WILL BE SHOT AT TEN. 
	ALL TAXES WILL BE RAISED TWENTY 
	PER CENT AT TEN-THIRTY.
   
	   The people are frightened at this and call others
 	to read.
 
182.	COURTYARD BACK OF PALACE. Officer
	enters from palace with sixteen  soldiers.  He
 	picks out ten for a firing squad.  He goes to the 
	wall and paces off a distance, then lines up his
	firing squad.  He then takes the other six and 
	goes back into the palace.

183. 	COUNCIL ROOM. Enrico enters with Magistrate 
	carrying a book.  Enrico leads him across
 	the room and says:
 
SP:	"THE WEDDING TAKES PLACE HERE!" 

	   The Magistrate says "all right" and gets
 	ready.
 
184.	DUNGEONS UNDER PALACE. Conwell and 
	guards with guns enter and open the door of 
	cell and drag Roland out leaving old Colonel in. 
	They lock the door.  Roland reaches through 
	the bars and grasps Bird's hand, saying "Good-
	bye."  They take out Roland, who has a handkerchief 
	tied around his head.  March out.  Roland 
	then straightens up and marches out like a 
	Sidney Carton.
 
185.	COUNCIL ROOM.   Enrico and Magistrate are
	waiting (no guns on anybody in this scene). 
	Countess enters with Rosalie who is terrified and 
	completely cowed.  Enrico goes to her, pinches 
	her cheek and says:

SP:	"WELL, HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR 
	MIND TO MARRY CONWELL?"
 
	   She weakly shakes her head and says she
	doesn't know what to do. Enrico smiles and
	says:

SP:	"SO YOU'D RATHER SEE YOUR FATHER 
	KILLED, WOULD YOU?" 

	   She miserably shakes her head and says "No."
	Enrico pats her on the shoulder and says: 
	"That's a sensible little girl."

186.	HALL OF PALACE.  Roland, with two guards
	and Conwell, comes up the stairs and they march 
	to the door of council room and stop.  Conwell 
	smiles at Roland and says:

SP:	"I DID YOU A GOOD TURN, NOW YOU 
	ARE GOING TO DO ME ONE." 

	   Roland looks at him suspiciously and Conwell 
	still smiling, says:

SP:	"YOU'RE GOING TO BE BEST MAN AT MY 
	WEDDING." 

	   He then throws the door wide open and indicates 
	the wedding party on the opposite side of 
	the room, with a flourish.  Roland looks in 
	astounded and horrified.

187.	COUNCIL ROOM.  Enrico, Magistrate, Countess 
	and Rosalie standing opposite door.  They 
	all look at doorway and see Conwell and Roland. 
	Rosalie stands transfixed with her eyes wide
	open.

188.	HALL IN PALACE.  Roland stands transfixed,
	looking at Rosalie.  Conwell invites him in with 
	a sinister smile and enters first, followed by Roland, 
	who is followed by the two guards. 

189.	COUNCIL ROOM.  Conwell enters, followed by 
	Roland and two guards.  Conwell crosses to 
	Rosalie but Roland stops near door, with guards 
	back of him almost in doorway.  Conwell takes 
	Rosalie's hand, tells her Roland is to be their 
	best man and, looking tauntingly at Roland, he 
	leans over and kisses her.  This infuriates Roland 
	so he cannot contain himself.  He suddenly 
	whirls, pushes the two guards in the face. They 
	fall through the door out into the hall. Roland
	quickly closes the door.

190.	HALL IN PALACE. The two guards fall 
	through the doorway, sprawling on the floor. 

191.	COUNCIL ROOM.  Roland closes the door and 
	locks it, turns and rushes upon the astonished 
	Conwell.  Then follows a general mixup.  Roland 
	having to fight Conwell, Enrico and possibly 
	the Magistrate--or the Magistrate might be an 
	old guy who beats it out the window as soon
 	as the fight begins.   Rosalie tries to help by
 	picking up a vase or some such object and hitting 
	Conwell or Enrico, but the Countess stops her 
	and Rosalie keeps the Countess busy by struggling 
	with all her might.  Conwell must be put 
	out completely and Roland conquers Enrico and 
	the Magistrate and would be a complete winner
 	but for the Countess.  While she is struggling
 	with Rosalie and the fight is going on, the 
	guards in the hall struggle to their feet and begin 
	banging on the door.  The Countess hears this 
	and her object is to get the door open.  She is 
	prevented for some time by Rosalie but just as 
	Roland has finished off Conwell and the Magistrate 
	and has Enrico down and practically out, 
	the Countess manages to get the door open and 
	let in the two guards. They cover Roland and 
	he rises and surrenders. Conwell and Enrico are 
	pretty far gone but they manage to get up and 
	Enrico says to the guards:

SP:	"TAKE HIM TO THE COURTYARD AND 
	SHOOT HIM!" 

	   The guards rush Roland out--Rosalie collapses. 

	   During this fight we see a long shot of Tom 
	with an American flag and the marines coming 
	down the street.
  
	   A man running to a group of the populace and 
	saying: "The Americans are coming!"   The 
	whole of this group then run out toward the
	palace.  This group runs to the crowd in front
	of the palace and yell:  "The Americans are
	coming!"  The crowd falls back to the other
	side of the Plaza and the soldiers guarding the 
	palace look anxiously up and down.

	   Tom with his marines rushes into the plaza. 
	The crowd falls back and the soldier guards beat
 	it hot foot.  Part of the marines rush into the
	palace, led by Tom.  The man with the flag and 
	the rest of them stop outside and guard the 
	palace.
   
	   Also, during this fight the officer and his guard 
	of six men take the King and Councilors out 
	of their cells and lead them off toward the courtyard, 
	line them up against the wall, tie their 
	hands behind them, blindfold each one and are 
	just about to give the order to shoot when Tom 
	rushes into the courtyard with his marines, who 
	chase the soldiers off and Tom picks up the 
	King and carries him and shoos them all before 
	him into the palace, having jerked off their 
	blindfolds.

192.	HALLWAY OF PALACE.  Just as the two
	guards bring Roland out of the Council Room into 
	the hall and start toward the stairs, Tom runs in at 
	front with his marines.  The guards, seeing them, 
	drop Roland and beat it out the back window. 
	Roland greets Tom ecstatically, looks at his 
	watch, sees that it is one-half minute to ten and
	says:

SP:    "TRY AND SAVE THE KING AND COUNCIL!" 

	   Tom wants to know where they are and Roland
	points down stairs and back.  Roland tells twenty
	of the marines to come with him and the rest
	run down stairs with Tom.  Roland leads his 
	little bunch into the  council room.
 
193.	COUNCIL ROOM.  Countess is holding up Rosalie,  
	Conwell leaning against the wall side of
	her.  Magistrate is starting marriage service.
	Enrico is sitting on the table holding his head 
	and watching the ceremony.  The door bursts 
	open and in rushes Roland with six marines.  He 
	rushes over and grasps Rosalie and tells the  
	marines to cover all the others, which they do. 

194.	COURTYARD OF PALACE.  Officers just finishing 
	blindfolding King and Councilors.  They
	are all lined up to be shot. Firing squad is all 
	ready--sixteen in all, now.  Officer leaves King 
	and Councilors and takes place at end of firing
	squad.  He is just about to raise his sword when
	Tom runs in from the Palace, lets out a yell, 
	and followed by his twenty marines rushes in. 
	The soldiers seeing them, run like mad, chased 
	by the marines. Tom quickly jerks off blindfolds 
	and shoos the whole bunch--King and Councilors 
	--into the palace.

195.	COUNCIL ROOM.  Colonel Bird and two marines 
	run in.  Rosalie rushes to her father's arms 
	and Roland tells Bird to look after her and to 
	go into the hall, which they do.  He tells two 
	of the marines to guard Conwell and the Countess 
	and Magistrate. He then grabs Enrico, tells the 
	other six marines to follow, and drags Enrico 
	out into the hall, followed by six marines. 

196.	HALLWAY IN PALACE.  Colonel Bird and
	Rosalie are waiting.  Roland drags Enrico out,
	followed by six marines.  They start toward the 
	front.   At this moment the King and Council
	come up the stairs headed by Tom. Roland grabs 
	the King in his other hand, calls Tom and tells 
	him to bring the King along; hands him over to 
	Tom.  Tells the marines to herd along the 
	Council, and they all go toward front of hall. 

197.	FRONT OF THE PALACE.  People waiting.
	American soldiers there.  Roland and Tom drag
 	the King and Enrico out on the porch, followed 
	by Bird and Marines. The people become silent, 
	not knowing what has happened. 

CLOSE UP OF ROLAND STARTING SPEECH.  He
	raises his hand while Tom holds the King.  He
	points at the King, then turns and says: 

SP:	"MY FRIENDS, FOR TEN YEARS YOUR 
	BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY HAS BEEN RULED 
	BY THIS COMIC OPERA KING, WHO HAS 
	NOT DRAWN A SOBER BREATH SINCE 
	HE ASCENDED THE THRONE." 

	   Tom holds up the King, to whom Roland
	points--the  King  weakly  protesting.  Roland 
	turns front and speaks again, pointing at Enrico: 

SP:	"LAST NIGHT THE KING WAS DETHRONED 
	BY THE MOST CORRUPT AND 
	CONTEMPTIBLE GRAFTER THE COUNTRY 
	HAS EVER KNOWN--ENRICO DE 
	CASTANET!" 

	   He points at Enrico, who grits his teeth and 
	wants to pounce on Roland, but is restrained 
	by guns of marines at his back.  Roland looks 
	triumphantly at Enrico, then front, and says: 

SP:	"THE FIRST ACT OF THIS TYRANT, ON
	ASSUMING POWER, WAS TO RAISE THE 
	ALREADY EXORBITANT TAXES!" 

	   The people nod their heads "yes" and shake 
	their fists at Enrico.   Roland points to Enrico
 	and says, "Look at him."  He then turns to the
	King and says "Look at him."  Then he turns 
	to the people and says:

SP:	"IS EITHER OF THESE WRETCHES FIT 
	TO RULE THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY?" 

	   The people shake their heads yelling "No, no," 
	and to-helling both the King and Enrico. 

CLOSE UP OF ROLAND listening to this demonstration, 
	turning first to the King and then to Enrico, 
	as if to say "Ah, you see," and then front again 
	and says:
 
SP:	"IN AMERICA WE CHOOSE OUR OWN
	RULERS AND DETERMINE OURSELVES 
	WHAT OUR TAXES ARE TO BE." 

LONG SHOT OF THE CROWD--Hearing this, turning 
	to each other and expressing their approval of 
	the idea, one or two yelling out exclamations of 
	approval.

CLOSE UP OF ROLAND--Smiling, looking again at 
	the men on his right and left and again speaking 
	front:
 
SP:	"WHY NOT CHANGE THIS GOVERNMENT 
	INTO A DEMOCRACY LIKE AMERICA 
	AND ALL THE CIVILIZED COUNTRIES 
	OF THE WORLD?" 

LONG SHOT OF THE CROWD, yelling approval, waving 
	their hats and hands and (fade out). 

T:	AND SO A NEW REPUBLIC WAS BORN.
 	THEY TRIED TO MAKE ROLAND PRESIDENT, 
	BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE JOB HE WANTED.
 
198.	FADE IN JUDGE'S COURT. Roland is sitting 
	on the bench all dolled up in a judge's rig.  
	Beside him stands Tom in a policeman's uniform.
	He indicates to Tom to bring in the prisoners. 
	Tom tells an officer to open the door. 

CLOSE UP OF DOOR AT SIDE OF ROOM. Officer 
	opens door and the King and four Councilors 
	and Enrico file past the camera going to the 
	front of the Judge's bench.

LONG SHOT OF COURTROOM, showing prisoners, 
	Judge and Tom.
 
CLOSE UP OF ROLAND looking over the prisoners 
	and saying:
 
SP:	"YOU ARE ALL SENTENCED TO ONE
	YEAR IN PRISON--THIS COUNTRY MUST 
	BE MADE SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY AND 
	INSURANCE." 

	   The prisoners all look at each other in dismay. 
	Tom steps down, starts to jerk Enrico roughly 
	toward the door.  Roland raises his hand and 
	speaks:

SP:	"TREAT THEM GENTLY, CHIEF. THEIR 
	POLICIES DON'T EXPIRE FOR ELEVEN
	MONTHS!"
 
	   Then Tom takes them very gently and leads 
	them out of the room. As they go out, Roland 
	says:
 
SP:	"WE'LL CALL THAT A DAY. COURT IS 
	ADJOURNED!" 

	   He leaves by door at back.

199.	GARDEN.  Rosalie waiting.  Roland comes to
	her.  (Fade out.)
