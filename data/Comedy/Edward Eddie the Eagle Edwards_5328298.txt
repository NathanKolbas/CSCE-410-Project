EDDIE THE EAGLE

by

Sean Macaulay

Based on a true story.

August 30, 2014
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

At the bottom of a 1970s avocado bath, a bathplug chain
drifts from side to side in the soapy water.

EDDIE (VO)
Every great athlete is born with a
natural talent. Arnold Palmer,
Jimmy Connors, Muhammad Ali, the
illustrious Brazilian Pele...

A boy's hand appears holding a waterproof plastic watch. The
seconds tick by as bubbles begin to stream upwards.

EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
Every sporting legend you can
mention — naturally gifted from
birth.

Ten-year-old Eddie Edwards bursts to the surface, purple
faced and gasping for air.

EDDIE (VO) (CONT’D)
And I was no exception.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Little Eddie, hair still wet, carries his Gola kitbag to the
front door. He is a stocky kid with a determined jaw.

EDDIE (VO)
A week after my tenth birthday I
equalled the Cheltenham Junior
Swimming League record for holding
my breath underwater.

He stands on tiptoes, straining for the lock.

EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
That meant I was ready to compete
at the highest level.

A woman in a nightgown appears — Eddie’s mother JANETTE.
She's a large, jolly woman in a muumuu and brown tinted
glasses, equal parts warmth and anxiety.

JANETTE
And where d'you think you're going,
young man?
EDDIE
Rome. I'm going to hold my breath
in the Olympics and win a gold
medal.

She regards him thoughtfully, then goes and rummages in the
hall closet.

Among the coats and umbrellas is a pair of National Health
KNEE CALIPERS.

Eddie looks at them darkly until she emerges holding out an
empty Jaffa Cakes biscuit tin.

JANETTE
Well, you’d better take this for
your medals then, hadn't you.

Eddie tucks the tin under his arm, relieved. “Good thinking.
JANETTE (CONT'D)
And make sure you pack your hankie.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Eddie walks along the damp pavement. It’s a neglected working-—
class neighborhood, all stray dogs and misspelled graffiti.

EDDIE (VO)
I soon found out there wasn't an
Olympic event for holding your
breath.

He studies the time-table at a bus stop.
EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
And there wasn't a bus to Rome from
the end of our street.
(rain drizzles down)
And Mum was absolutely right.
He wipes a sleeve over his runny nose.
EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
I should have packed my hankie.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Eddie toys with a consoling cup of cocoa, poring over his
treasured 1972 Olympics photo album — Moments of Glory.
EDDIE (VO)
But I didn't care. I knew I was
going to be a part of it someday.

He studies the Kodachrome images enrapt — Jesse Owens, Olgar
Korbut, Mark Spitz — triumphant medal winners cheered and
chaired aloft.

JANETTE
Alright, pet. Time for bed.

She removes his cup, revealing Eddie's handiwork: five
chocolate rings on the plastic tablecloth — the Olympic logo.

EDDIE (VO)
The first step was finding the
right sport.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

Eddie swings a battered old cricket bat at an incoming ball
and misses completely.

EDDIE (VO)
Something that played to my
strengths.

He swings again with the same result. And again. And again,
long into the night.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
EDDIE (VO)
I knew there'd be technical
difficulties, and a fair bit of
soul-searching.
Eddie trudges home, dragging his kitbag behind him.
EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
Every great sportsman has to

confront his demons eventually.

Eddie walks smack bang into a lamp post.

INT. OPTICIAN'S - DAY

EDDIE (VO)
But it helps if you can see them
first.
4.

Eddie squints through an ancient eye test machine at a chart
of letters — all wildly blurred.

Thick lenses are dropped in front of his eyes, snapping the
letters in focus.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

EDDIE (VO)
Mum was a big fan of my new
incarnation.

Eddie shows off his new spectacles — National Health jam-jar
lenses with thick black frames.

JANETTE
Very smart.

EDDIE (VO)
Dad too, I think.

Eddie’s Dad, TERRY, is a no-nonsense ruddy-faced builder. He
gives the glasses a wiggle.

TERRY
"My name is Michael Caine."

EDDIE (VO)
The playground was less convinced.

EXT. CRICKET NETS - DAY

KID
Oi Four-eyes!/Goggle-eyed git!

A dozen kids make “goggle” faces through the threadbare
cricket netting. Eddie gives them a V-sign. Resumes his
stance at the wicket.

EDDIE (VO)
It makes a big difference being
able to see properly.

He swings at the incoming ball and just like before, misses
completely — taking this one right in the face.

EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
You get a much clearer perspective
on the best way to fulfill your
sporting potential.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Eddie drops his broken glasses into the biscuit tin.

EXT. SCHOOL RUGBY FIELD - DAY

EDDIE (VO)
Like making sure you pick the right
size ball for your physical type.

Eddie in ill-fitting shirt and shorts, chases a bobbling

rugby ball, trying to scoop it up without success until the
opposing team flattens him.

INT. EDDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Another pair of broken glasses drops into the tin.
EDDIE (VO)
And choosing the best terrain for
your endurance capabilities.
INT. SWIMMING-POOL - DAY
A starting pistol sends Eddie and his classmates into
the freezing water. They all emerge and swim off except for
you know who.
EDDIE (VO)
Let’s just say it was a process of
trial and error.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
We move down Eddie’s effortfully handwritten list of sports:
cricket, football, swimming, hurdles, boxing... All crossed
out except for the last one — cycling.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Eddie peddles furiously on his trusty Raleigh Chopper —
picking up speed towards a home-made jumping ramp.

The local kids watch as he flies into the air — so high that
he clears the long line of milk crates.

He lands safely with a triumphant WHOOP only to discover that
he hasn’t left enough room to stop.
EDDIE
Shhhhhhhhhhhiiii-

He SLAMS into a neighbor’s wall and FLIPS over the hedge with
a CRASH of glass and a sickening THUD.

EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
It was not what you’d call a
textbook landing, but I couldn’t
have been happier.

The local kids wince as they find Eddie writhing amid the
remains of a smashed green house.

EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
I was on my way. Part of the big
show, admired and appreciated for
who I was.

Eddie is helped to his feet, badly cut and covered with
broken plants.

LOCAL KID
Fucking maniac!

INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

EDDIE (VO)
And then came the bombshell.

Eddie lies on his bed reading Moments of Glory, like he does
every night. A boy alone under his Evel Knievel poster.

TERRY (OS)
Eddie! Get down here now!

INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

Janette and Terry sit at the Formica table, bewildered and
exasperated at this crazy son of theirs covered in scratches
and cuts.

TERRY
Enough’s enough. You're spending
your holidays with me down at the
site. It’s time you learn the
plastering trade.

Eddie digests this like a death sentence, knee bouncing up
and down.
EDDIE
What about my Olympic preparations?

Terry says nothing. Just picks off some debris from Eddie's
sweater. Eddie looks to Mum. But she has to agree with Dad.

JANETTE
You never know, pet, you might like
it.

EXT. HILL TOP - NIGHT

Eddie sits with his bike, gazing out over the lights of
Cheltenham below.

EDDIE (VO)
So that was the sporting career of
Eddie Edwards.

Down below him is a dirty noisy building site — his future.

EDDIE (VO) (CONT'D)
Eleven different sports and nothing
to show for it except twelve pairs
of broken glasses. (I sat on my
sixth pair in the library.)

He scratches his knees absently as his defeated face slips
into darkness. The crushing despair that only a 10-year-boy
can feel.

We hold. Long enough to feel this could be the end of our
story... and it probably would be except for the blaze of
white light that suddenly illuminates the sky.

Eddie sits up annoyed, but then increasingly intrigued.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

He pedals back down the hill as fast as his wobbly wheel will
allow. Reaches a wire fence with a big sign:

"ENGLAND'S FIRST DRY SKI SLOPE —
OPENING THIS SUMMER!"

He dumps his bike to get a closer look: "In conjunction with
the British Olympic Ski Association."

His gaze drops to the corner of the sign. There it is. The
magic symbol of the Olympics — five interlocking rings.
EXT. DRY SKI SLOPE - NIGHT

Eddie clambers over the wire fence and scrambles up the dirt
slope, all pain forgotten as he steps into the glaring light.

EDDIE
Bloody ada.

He is standing at the top of a HUGE floodlit ski slope.

He steps out onto the plastic surface and feels the springy
bristles under his feet. He’s awe-struck, like he’s stepping
out for the first time onto the moon.

His battered urchin features tremble with emotion as he’s
swallowed up by the heavenly glare of the floodlights...

EXT. CALGARY OLYMPICS, DOWNHILL FINALS - DAY

The rousing theme tune from BBC’s Ski Sunday. Out of the
whiteness comes an adult SKIER zig-zagging down a slalom
course towards a finish line, snow spraying in his wake.

A title card reads: "12 years later."
A crowd leaps to its feet, deafeningly loud.

RON PICKERING (VO)
.+. This is amazing! This is
sensational! Edwards is carving up
the Calgary hillside like a Sunday
roast.

RON PICKERING, the BBC’s tubby, excitable voice of skiing,
grabs his microphone as the skier crosses the finish line.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
Oh my word! He’s only gone and done
it.

The crowd swarms forward as ADULT EDDIE takes off his
goggles. He’s in his 20s with a tan and cool bouffant hair.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
Get out the champagne because Great
Britain has just taken its first
ever gold in the men’s downhill.
And this is the man responsible,
“Fast” Eddie Edwards.

The crowd lifts up Eddie with a cheer.
RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
The plasterer’s son from Cheltenham
— now turned alpine champion and
world-class —

WOMAN’S VOICE
Oh for gawd's sake. Get a wiggle
on.

Ron Pickering looks up confused. So does the crowd. Eddie
drops backwards to the ground.

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT’D)
Come on. Pick a lane.

INT. VAN - MOVING - DAY
A horn HONKS and Eddie snaps to. He is in the front seat
being driven along by his MOTHER. A Charles and Di air-
freshener swings from the rearview mirror.
In reality, Eddie is a stocky bloke in his twenties with a
large jaw, no tan and gingery close cropped hair. His jam-jar

spectacles are held together by a Band-Aid.

JANETTE
Here we go, pet.

His mother turns off past a sign: "British Men's Downhill Ski
Trials."
EXT. BOSA DOWNHILL SKI TRIALS - DAY

The crowd is modest but well-heeled. Barbour jackets,
cravats, Hermés headscarves.

They applaud politely as a skier crosses the finish line.
Over in the sponsors’ enclosure, a throng of suited
businessmen pay slightly more attention to the canapés and
free champagne.

A title card reads: "England, September 1986."

EXT. BOSA PARKING FIELD - DAY

The Edwards family van noses its way between Range Rovers and
Jaguars to find a parking spot.
10.

INT. VAN - DAY

Janette and Eddie share a final glance. This is his big
moment, even though they’re both trying to act like it isn’t.

JANETTE
Knock ‘em dead.

He grabs his skis and races off to the check-in, oblivious as
he clips a wing mirror. She watches him go, and we see the
true depth of her anxiety at having a daredevil like Eddie
for a child.

She takes out her wool and needles. Starts to knit. Alone in
the dirty cement covered van.

INT. CHANGING-ROOM - DAY

The room is full of Olympic class skiers, which means a
hubbub of blokey posh accents. They’re in no hurry to
acknowledge Eddie as he breezes in.

He covers up his discomfort by humming to himself until
finally, he finds a spare coat hook at the end.

TARGET (VO)
Great Britain has languished for
too long on past glories - in
business and in sports.

EXT. CORPORATE ENCLOSURE - DAY

The sponsors have gathered round a podium to hear DUSTIN
TARGET’s address. He is the conscientious new broom head of
BOSA with immaculate green blazer and name tag to prove it.

TARGET
But just as you have entered a new
era of business, so we have
embarked on a new era of sports —
and it’s one that requires a new
kind of athlete.

EXT. STARTING PLATFORM - DAY

Eddie shuffles forward, flapping his arms and making strange
warm-up noises.

EDDIE
Edwards, E. Cheltenham Winter
Sports Centre.
11.

The STARTING OFFICIAL directs Eddie to the start gate; a
glance at Eddie's shoddy equipment.

EXT. CORPORATE ENCLOSURE - DAY

Target surveys the crowd to make sure his theme is
resonating.

TARGET
And just as the world of business
looks to sporting champions for
inspiration, so we in turn can now
look to you — our distinguished
sponsors — for ways to make our
athletes more competitive.

EXT. STARTING PLATFORM - DAY
TARGET (VO)
You are not just successful
competitors. You’re brand leaders —
the best in your field. And you
deserve the best in return.
Eddie wipes the steam off his goggles and snaps them into
place. They're pink.
EXT. CORPORATE ENCLOSURE - RESUME
Target leans forward, savoring his crowd-pleasing big finish.
TARGET
Ladies and gentlemen, today you’re

going to see just that.

The KLAXON rudely cuts the applause short.

EXT. BOSA DOWNHILL SLOPE - DAY

Eddie smashes down the plastic slope. He barely follows the
"line," which shows his best quality is suicidal bravery. Not
much style, plenty of guts.

One by one, the sponsors turn to watch.
Eddie takes the corners too fast and too tight, slamming over

slalom flags. He looks like he'll wipe out at any moment, but
amazingly he hangs on.
12.

Target's face tightens at this careening blot on his
landscape, flailing into the last two turns.

Suddenly the flaw in Eddie’s all-out approach becomes
apparent. He simply fails to make one of the turns.

He flies off the course, right through the sponsors’
enclosure, and SMASHES into one of the hoardings.

Silence. The drip of toppled ice buckets. The dismayed stares
of sponsors at the smashed billboard.

"I bet he drinks Carling Black Label."

Target turns to his Aide. Beckons him over. Now.

EXT. BOSA DOWNHILL SLOPE - DAY
The Course Official escorts Eddie off the slope.

EDDIE
See that? I was pinging down the
hill like a ferret.

The Official can only watch as Eddie re-assembles his
glasses, wired with excitement

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Forty-five seconds at the halfway
line. If I'd gone any faster I'd
have taken off.

MALE VOICE
Er, you did.

Eddie looks up. It’s Target’s Aide and he’s holding out
Eddie’s gear and kitbag.

EDDIE
Hold a minute. I’ve still got a
second run to do.

AIDE
Not anymore.

Eddie doesn’t understand. Until he follow’s the Aide’s
glance. Locates the real reason for his expulsion - the
distant hovering figure of Target.

EXT. BOSA PARKING FIELD - DAY

The Aide escorts Eddie and his skis back to his van.
13.

EDDIE
This is outrageous.

AIDE
It’s very simple. We've only got 18
months to prep the squad for
Calgary. You’re just too raw.

EDDIE
But I’ve got run times as good as
that bunch.

AIDE

It's not just about speed. It's
about finesse. Polish. Boys who can
fit seamlessly into the squad.

EDDIE
Public school boys, you mean.

The Aide doesn’t try to deny it. He hands Eddie his kit bag.
Leaves him next to his van: “Edwards & Son, Quality Finishes.
Get plastered with us!”

EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

A pneumatic drill ROARS. Eddie is up to his elbows in muck,
“knocking up” a big tin of plaster on a busy renovation job.

DAD inspects the resulting plaster like a three star chef.

TERRY
Too thick.

EDDIE
“Too thick”? I’ve been going like a
Kenwood mixer all morning.

Terry fetches the water hose, unmoved.

TERRY
Quality plastering’s no different
from anything else. You want to get
on, you gotta put in the graft.

EDDIE
“Quality plastering.” All I’m doing
is mixing up mud.

Terry hands Eddie the water hose.
14.

TERRY
There’s no quality plaster without
quality mud.

Eddie kicks dried cement off his boots.

EDDIE
Yeah, well, I’m still stuck in it.

TERRY
How many times I got to tell you?
Do your City and Guilds and get
qualified.

EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

Eddie at work in the wet and the cold - lugging bricks,
hauling cement, stirring plaster. Hating every minute even
though he never buckles.

He gets his weekly pay envelope from the OFFICE GIRL and it’s
a pittance. He looks over to see his Dad getting yelled at by
the FOREMAN. Such is life on a building site.

EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

The BRICKIES sit around at lunchtime reading the tabloids and
smoking roll-ups. They’re a hard-bitten lot. A couple even
swig beer.

Eddie sits off to one side, munching on a banana and milk
from a carton. His fingernails chipped with dried cement.

BRICKIE
That's strange. They must have
cropped you out.

The Brickie holds out his tabloid to Eddie. On the sports
pages is a photo of Target and the British Downhill squad
heading off to St. Moritz.

Eddie grabs the paper to see for himself. All the athletes in
their Olympic blazers. The final nail in the coffin.

The Brickie starts humming the BBC "Ski Sunday" theme music
and miming the slalom.

EDDIE
Get stuffed.
15.

BRICKIE
Hey, I wasn't the one telling
everyone I was going to be on the
team.

EDDIE
It’s not a team. It’s a squad. You
don’t even know what you’re talking
about.

The other workmen join in the humming, drowning Eddie out
even after he throws his banana skin at them.

INT. EDDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eddie lies on his bed amid his Olympic shrine. Skiing
posters, Olympic albums, photos of young Eddie accepting
junior trophies, showing off his latest plaster cast; older
Eddie teaching little kids how to ski.

His Mother enters with some tea and Jaffa Cakes on a tray.
By his bedside is the newspaper story about the British
Downhill Squad.

JANETTE
Come on, pet. It’s not the end of
world.

EDDIE

No. It just feels like it.
He rolls over onto his side, but there’s no escape. Even his
duvet cover has a Winter Olympic pattern — skiing,
tobogganing, ski-jumping...
EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

Eddie works away in the sunshine. Radio 1 in the background.
He’s graduated from mixing to proper plastering now.

Terry gives an approving nod then exits, past JULIE, the
office girl who hands out the weekly paychecks.

JULIE
Hello stranger.

EDDIE
Alright Julie. How’s it going?

She comes up to Eddie with his envelope. They regard each
other for a moment, quite comfortable together.
16.

JULIE
So you're finally going for your
diploma?

EDDIE

City and Guilds. Level one.

JULIE
What about your downhill training?

He gives an airy wave of his trowel.

EDDIE
Hanging out with a bunch of
chinless wonders. Who needs it?

Not him, that’s for sure.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
If I wanted to be “polished,” I'd
be a bloody doorknob, wouldn’t I.

She waits. Lets him finish.

JULIE
So you're free at the weekends
then?

She hands Eddie his pay envelope. Makes him tug it to get
it free.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eddie inspects his smartest ‘date’ outfit in the mirror — a
dark shellsuit.

It’s fair to say he’s not entirely at home with dressing up.
Even when he adds the finishing touch — his one pair of
unbroken glasses.

INT. JULIE’S LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie sits on a floral sofa next to Julie, watching TV. We
all know how these things should go...

Until we notice the TV is showing Evel Knievel at Wembley
Stadium. He’s getting ready to jump 13 double-decker buses
and Eddie can’t keep his eyes off it.

EDDIE
I did a jump like that when I was a
kid. Thirteen milk crates.
17.

She gets up and dims the lights.

JULIE
It’s okay my parents aren’t back
till 11.

She sits back next to him. But Eddie remains glued to Evel
Knievel barrelling towards the ramp.

JULIE (CONT'D)
You can sit closer if you want.

EDDIE
I can see alright from here.

JULIE
I meant to me.

Oh. Eddie turns to face her.

They kiss but Eddie’s gaze is drawn back to the TV — Knievel
shooting into the air, suspended for an eternity...

The image reflected in Eddie’s glasses until — CLICK. Julie
hits the remote.

JULIE (CONT'D)
Come on. Concentrate.

EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

But it’s no use. Eddie has had an idea. And it’s an idea
that won’t go away as he trowels away on a low wall beside
his Dad.

TERRY
Guild requirement for pea-shingle
is half an inch for the base.

Eddie’s brain is miles away as he intently works the cement
into some kind of strange shape.

TERRY (CONT'D)
Are you listening?

EDDIE
I'm listening. Pea-shingle. Half an
inch.

TERRY

Then what the chuff is that?
18.

The strange shape in Eddie’s plaster is revealed. A lovingly
sculpted ski-jump.
EXT. BOSA HQ - DAY

Eddie walks up the steps past the BOSA insignia.

INT. BOSA HQ LIBRARY - DAY

In the reverent hush of the archive department, a BOSA
OFFICIAL deals with Eddie’s inquiry.

BOSA OFFICIAL
I hate to disappoint you but we
don't have an Olympic ski-jumping
squad.

He gives a consoling smile, but Eddie doesn’t look remotely
disappointed.

EDDIE
Not even a small one?

The Official shakes his head.
BOSA OFFICIAL
Nope. Britain hasn’t had a ski-
jumper since 1936.

EDDIE
Oh that’s terrible.

He can barely contain himself.

EXT. BOSA HQ - DAY

He runs down the steps and launches himself off like a ski-
jumper. Down the street he goes, joyfully leaping off every
bench doing his best Ron Pickering impersonation.

EDDIE
Oh this is amazing, this is
sensational.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Prince Andrew and Fergie’s newly happy faces are covered by a

big dollop of mash potato. The fancy china is out for the
Edwards’‘s Sunday roast.
19.

JANETTE
Which conversion are you talking
about? The kitchen-dinette on the
corner?

TERRY
That’s the one. With the
pebbledash.
(he stabs a Brussel
sprout)
Bursting with possibilities.

Eddie sits at the other end of the table, knee bouncing up
and down like crazy. He repeatedly rolls a pea off his fork
onto a mashed potato ski slope.

EDDIE
Mum. Dad. I’ve got an announcement.

He can barely contain his excitement.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
I’m not going to be taking my City
and Guilds. I’ve made new plans.

They turn and look.

JANETTE
Plans?

TERRY
What plans?

Eddie adjusts his glasses. Looks up with total conviction.
EDDIE
I’m going to train as a ski-jumper
and go to the Olympics.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eddie rummages under the bed, packing up his ski gear.
Janette watches aghast. Terry paces around in disbelief.

TERRY
This is insane. You got your first
exam in six weeks.

Eddie just keeps packing.
EDDIE

It's not like I'm taking up ballet.
It's still skiing. Only higher.
20.

JANETTE
How much higher?

EDDIE
Twenty stories.

Her face drops with horror.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Give or take.

He struggles to pull the zipper over his skis. No one offers
to help. Terry paces around in disbelief.

TERRY
Britain doesn’t even have a ski-
jumping squad.

EDDIE
It does now.

He finally closes the zipper with a triumphant grin. Only to
see he is underestimated his father’s anger.

TERRY
And how are you going to pay for
all this? Because we’re not going
through all that again with the
bank and the bailiffs —

EDDIE
You won’t have to. Florian got me a
job: junior ski instructor.

Eddie picks up a ski resort brochure. Shows them a photo of
young kids being taught how to snowplow.

JANETTE
Florian?

EDDIE
From the Winter Centre. He’s back
in Germany now.

Eddie points to four ascending ski-jumps in the background.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
In Garmisch.

He leaves his parents blanching at the four ski-jumps —
small, medium, large and gigantic.

JANETTE
He’s going to break his neck.
21.

TERRY
I’m going to break his neck.

INT. STAIRS - DAY

Eddie carries his gear downstairs, all ready to leave. Terry
follows but doesn’t help.

EDDIE
You can’t tell me you never had a
dream when you were a kid.

TERRY
Of course I did. I’m not made of
stone, am I.
This is news to Eddie. Great news.

EDDIE
Really? You never told me.

He pauses at the bottom of the stairs. Turns to Terry.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
«+. So what did you want to be?

TERRY
A plasterer.

They look at each other, both knowing it’s hopeless.
Janette waits at the front door to see him off, as always.

JANETTE
You're a stubborn bugger, you know
that. Ever since you were a tot.
Climbed out of every crib we put
you in.

She gives him a ferocious hug as if somehow this will stop
him going.

JANETTE (CONT'D)
The only baby in the world who
liked landing on his head!
Terry and Janette exchange a look - helpless and hit for six.

Eighties pop music rises up as the brochure photo dissolves
to the real ski-jumps all lit up with spotlights.
22.

EXT. GARMISCH - NIGHT

A title card reads: “Garmisch, Germany. Site of the 1936
Winter Olympics.”

Eddie sits up excitedly. Peers out of the van he’s hitched a
ride in. The music is coming from the Walkman he wears on all
his travels.

EXT. GARMISCH JUMPS - NIGHT

Eddie hurries into the floodlit landing arena, still carrying
his gear.

The ascending row of ski-jump towers are lined above him. The
15m. The 40m. The 70m and above them on its own hill, the 90m
jump. A huge iron monster.

At the top, in silhouette, a JUMPER sets off down the ramp.
Eddie moves closer as the Jumper shoots into the air, soaring
through the sparkling snowflakes, seemingly forever until he
lands and skids to a perfect stop.

This is LARS MOBERG, the moustachioed superstar of the
Swedish national squad. He rejoins a monastic huddle of
ATHLETES and COACHES in yellow and blue jumpsuits.

It is all very high-tech with video monitors and walkie-
talkies.

Eddie moves closer still and sees this isn’t just the
national squad, it’s the Olympic squad.

There it is, on all their gear like a lucky omen — the five-
ring logo.
INT. GARMISCH DORM ROOM - DAWN

An LED alarm clock glows — 5.30am — in a tiny stuffy
dormitory crammed with bunk-beds.

Eddie creeps out with his gear, accidentally smacking a
sleeping roommate with his ski-tip.

GERMAN ROOMMATE
Hosenscheisser!

EDDIE
Bless you.
23.

EXT. GARMISCH 15M JUMP - DAWN

Eddie bypasses the baby jump and goes straight to the 15m
jump, all alone except for a distant snow groomer chugging
up the hill.

He slots in his skis and sets off. Here it is, the moment of
truth... He shoots off the ramp and PLOPS onto the slope,
gliding easily to a stop.

EDDIE
What a doddle.

He can’t believe his luck. It’s so easy. He turns to look at
the next jump up — the 40m.
EXT. GARMISCH 40M JUMP - DAWN

At the top of the ramp, Eddie finds this jump has two grooves
into which you slot your skis.

He takes a breath and pushes off. This jump is significantly
faster. He shoots into the air, WHOOPING with delight.

For one magical second he is flying, high above the twinkling
resort below.

Then reality returns and he CRASHES into the icy slope,
sliding to a halt face first.
EXT. GARMISCH SLOPE - DAY

A row of YOUNG SKIERS shuffle into line for FLORIAN from the
front office.

FLORIAN
Class, I want you to meet your new
instructor, Mr. Eddie.

CLASS
Good morning, Mr. Eddie.

Eddie gives the kids a wave, acting all cool.

EDDIE
Eddie. Fast Eddie. Whatever you
like.

FLORIAN

Mr. Eddie’s going be teaching you
the three S’s of skiing — smart,
sensible, safe.
24.

Eddie, we now see, has a huge bandage on his nose.
THE CLASS

Practice their snowplows down the hill under Eddie’s
supervision.

EDDIE
Okay, folks, nice practice
postures. Now let's try it for
real. Penguins to the left, polar
bears to the right.

Eddie’s concentration drifts enviously over to the Swedes on
the 70m. Flying through the air. Making it look so easy.

NASAL VOICE (VO)
Room for one more?

INT. SAUNA - DAY

Eddie emerges from a cloud of steam, sporting sturdy swimming
trunks and his huge nose plaster.

Lars and the Swedish team begrudgingly shuffle up as Eddie
plonks down on the bench.

EDDIE
Effermidaggen! Eddie Edwards, Great
Britain.

The Swedes just stare. Eddie presses on, undeterred.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I'll get right down to business if
I may. I've just started on the 40m
and I’m making solid progress, but
I'd really appreciate a few tips.

A vicious HISS of steam reveals the forbidding Swedish Coach,
ladling water on the rocks. Like all Swedes everywhere, given
half a chance, he has no clothes on.

SWEDISH COACH
You have been jumping long?

Eddie looks everywhere but at the coach’s genitalia.

EDDIE
About a week.
25.

SWEDISH COACH
And you think you are ready to
discover some advices from me?

Eddie nods, sweat dotting his brow, this intensely nude man
standing over him, hands on hips.

SWEDISH COACH (CONT’D)
You know who Matti Nykanen is?

EDDIE
He's only the best ski-jumper in
the world. The Flying Finn.

SWEDISH COACH
The best and the most craziest.

The Coach rocks back on his heels, arms akimbo.
SWEDISH COACH (CONT’D)
So maybe I give you something
harder?
It’s not exactly the phrase Eddie would choose, but okay.
SWEDISH COACH (CONT’D)
What is the maximum wideness for a
jumping ski?

Eddie boldly holds out his thumb and forefinger.

SWEDISH COACH (CONT’D)
And that is what exactly?

Eddie can't help it. His gaze drops for a millisecond.

EDDIE
++. About four inches.

The Coach SNAPS his fingers at Lars.

LARS

The maximum wideness is 11.5 cm.
EDDIE

That is about four inches, isn’t

it.

SWEDISH COACH
Not “exactly,” no. So you tell me
what is the most length of the ski?
26.

EDDIE
"The most length of the ski?"
(why doesn't anyone else
find this funny?)
Eight foot two.

It’s another bold guess and it provokes another finger-snap
at another naked jumper.

SWEDISH JUMPER
The ski has permission to be 77.5
cm taller than the height of the
jumper, but with no more taller
than 275 cm.

Eddie hitches his trunks nervously.

EDDIE
Well, like I said, I’m just
starting out.

SWEDISH COACH
In Sweden, the time to be starting
out is when you are five.

This time he gives a double finger-snap and the whole team
leaps up.

SWEDISH COACH (CONT’D)
We have not the moments for
beginners. Good day.

Out he goes, his naked team obediently shuffling after him.

EXT. GARMISCH JUMPS - DAWN

Two skis plop over a fence. Followed by Eddie, all alone
except for the distant snowgrooming machine on the hillside.

EDDIE
Bloody Swedes. What’d they ever do
apart from invent the meatball?

Eddie sets off down the 40m jump and it’s the same result —
another ice-gouging wipe-out.

Eddie lies splayed on the ice, groaning in pain. He tries to
move, but it’s agony.

The SOUND of the snowgrooming machine gets nearer until it
crests the hill, headlights blazing, and comes to a stop
right next to Eddie’s splayed form.
27.

The shadowy figure of the DRIVER drops to the ground and
inspects one of Eddie’s craters. All Eddie can see is a
glowing red tiparillo tip.

AMERICAN VOICE
So you’re the mystery elf who’s
been hacking up my slope every
night.

He walks over, dramatically backlit by his headlights, and
peers down at Eddie.

AMERICAN VOICE (CONT’D)
It’s just you? No pick-axe?

This is BRONSON PEARY, the resort’s resident snow groomer.
He’s commanding in a weathered sort of way with a certain
hard-partying ski bum panache — and yet he’s still only a
maintenance man.

PEARY
You do realize the time to start
jumping is when you’re five or six.

EDDIE
Thanks. The Swedes already told me
that.

Eddie gets as far as his hands and knees, wincing in pain.

PEARY
Did they also mention you've got
the wrong body shape?

Eddie has to check. Yes, this is the cigarillo-puffing
snowgroomer telling him this.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Just stating the obvious.

EDDIE
Well, state this.

He flicks him a V-sign. Peary climbs back behind the wheel
and gives a raspy laugh.

PEARY
And one more thing. You got the
wrong skis.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Oh, and one more thing. There’s no
such thing as British ski-jumpers.
They don’t exist.
28.

Eddie finally snaps.

EDDIE
What’d you know about it anyway?

Peary’s face darkens - some strange wounded flicker of
reflection. He turns and climbs back behind the wheel.

PEARY
Don’t even think about going on the
70.
EDDIE
You can’t stop me. I’m an employee.
PEARY
Still need my permission for

the 70.

He steers his rusty snow machine back up the hill,
spluttering into the mist.

Eddie watches it go, thoroughly bemused.
FLORIAN (VO)
You'd never guess he was part of
the US Olympic Squad.
INT. GARMISCH FRONT OFFICE - DAY
Eddie points out the window towards the slope.

EDDIE
Who, that guy?

FLORIAN
It’s true. Bronson Peary. He was in
the ‘72 squad under Warren Sharp.

Eddie’s jaw drops. No way.

EDDIE
“Bronson Peary...?” How come I
never heard of him?

FLORIAN
Well, they kicked him out,
obviously. Just before the Games.

EDDIE
What for?
29.

FLORIAN
Boozing. Womanizing. Being an
impossible asshole...

Take your pick. Eddie doesn’t care. He’s already smitten. He
looks back outside at the snowgroomer struggling up the hill.

EDDIE
No kidding. Warren Sharp, ‘72...

INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Peary’s weatherbeaten profile — face up as he works
underneath the snowgroomer.

PEARY
No.

EDDIE
Come on. All I want is a few tips.

Eddie crouches down, trying to make eye contact.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Florian told me how you used to
jump in America.

PEARY
Yeah, well, Florian also said he
screwed Princess Stephanie of

Monaco.

EDDIE
He showed me a clipping with a
photo.

PEARY

She's just a lookalike. He met her
in Verbier on a stag night.

EDDIE
Of you. The 90 meter at Lake Placid
— 1969, American Youth Cup finals.
You clocked 118 meters!

Peary slides out and climbs into his cabin.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Four years with Warren Sharp!

PEARY
Three years.
30.

Eddie doesn’t care. It’s still amazing.

EDDIE
You shouldn’t be fixing rust
buckets, you should be coaching.

“Rust bucket”? Peary’s face darkens.

PEARY
This is a PB 200 with a multiflex
tiller. Grooms 81 square meters an
hour.

It also leaks gunk. Peary surreptitiously wipes his hand as
he coaxes the engine into life.

EDDIE
I’m just saying if I had your
pedigree and experience —

PEARY
Well, you don’t.

He lurches out of the garage, Eddie giving chase.

EDDIE
I won’t get any better unless you
help me!

PEARY

Then you won’t get better.

He adjusts his rearview mirror, leaving Eddie in his wake,
full of churned up emotion he doesn't know how to deal with.

He rumbles on toward the slope, heart thumping, all
triggered. Not sure where it’s coming from.

Then he passes the Swedish jumpers in their gleaming Olympic
outfits. And notices again, rather more wistfully, his oil-
stained hands.

INT. GARMISCH BAR - NIGHT

The apres-ski crowd in full swing. Beautiful people and
hearty SWEDES. Eddie struggles to get to the bar after
another gruelling day of wipe-outs.

SWEDISH JUMPER
You are still looking for pointers?
(he jabs a finger to the
door )
It’s that way back to England.
31.

They laugh and close ranks, forcing Eddie to go farther down

the bar. He consults his home-made crib sheet.

EDDIE
"Glas Milch, bitte.”

The BARMAID serves him a glass of milk.
MALE VOICE

You just drink it straight? Nothing
in it?

It's Peary, perched in his regular corner nook, surrounded by
‘essentials’: pack of Tiparillos, Bic lighter, own personal

schnapps bottle, American flag ashtray.

EDDIE
on e si . m in training.
Don't b illy. I’m in training

PEARY
For what? The Japanese air force?

Peary takes small sips, unhurried, but relentless.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Good-looking young guy like you.
You shouldn’t be crashing into
mountains. You should be chasing
the ladies.

EDDIE
Yeah... That’s never really been my
specialty.
Eddie gulps down half his milk and wipes his chin.

PEARY
I wonder why.

More Swedes arrive, bumping Eddie so he spills his

EDDIE
Oi.
He gropes for a napkin, but none of them oblige.
EDDIE (CONT'D)

I thought they were all supposed to
be nice. Like Abba.

drink.

Peary smiles in spite of himself. A beat. The two men wedged
together. Eddie downs what’s left of his drink, spilling over

with admiration.
32.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
You stuck the first 90m at Copper
Peak - with no tailwind! Opening
Trials, 1970. I remember reading
all about it in my Winter Sports
omnibus...

Peary studies his newfound fan more closely even as he wipes
his milk moustache with his sleeve. And yes, he’s disarmingly
genuine.

EXT. GARMISCH STREET - NIGHT

The snowgroomer rumbles down main street going all of 7mph.
Eddie and Peary in the cabin, both quite indifferent to the
irate HONKING behind them.

PEARY
Viking turds.
(handing his open flask to
Eddie)
Here. Hold this.

Peary gives Eddie cryptic look. Then hits the indicator and
turns off towards a large building with a yellow and blue
flag.

INT. GARMISCH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

It is the Swedes’ training HQ. Peary enters using a key from
his big janitor keyring. Checks the coast is clear, then
beckons Eddie inside.

He goes up to the blackboard covered with diagrams and
trajectories.

PEARY
Look at this crap. Fucking pencil
pushers.

He messes up some numbers with his sleeve.
PEARY (CONT'D)
This is what's wrong with modern
jumping. They want to turn everyone
into robots.

He moves off in despair, inspecting the rest of the room.
33.

PEARY (CONT'D)
That’s why they can never
understand - jumping’s a paradox!
You've got to free your mind first.

He comes to a stop by a strange leather harness dangling from
the ceiling.

EDDIE
What’s the jumping paradox?

Peary turns and looks at Eddie: Is he serious?

EDDIE (CONT'D)
The Swedes forget to fill me in.

Peary gives a long-suffering sigh, enjoying this more than he
cares to admit.

PEARY
The foundation of any jump is the
take-off. The paradox you have to
master is simultaneously stretching
up and leaning into your descent.

He raises his palm up high to demonstrate — tilting it
forward, then pushing his arm out at a downwards angle.

PEARY (CONT'D)
It feels unnatural at first because
you actually take-off downwards,
not upwards. It only looks like you
go up because the hill falls away
so quickly. But the leaning forward
is how you gain wind resistance.

He repeats the motion, this time making a fist.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Every time you stay hunched over,
you just hit the ground faster.
So...

He switches back to the 6” ski model, Eddie trying to keep
pace with him.

PEARY (CONT'D)
What you need is a quadruple action
where the skis come up and the legs
stretch back and the body tilts
forward all while simultaneously
dropping. You see?

The little skier tilts and drops before Eddie’s eyes.
34.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Up, back, forward, down — all at
the same time. Up, back, forward,
down. Got that?

EDDIE
Up, back, forward, down.
(he nods)
PEARY

Okay, your turn.
Eddie reaches for the little skier.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Not the model. You.

THE STRANGE HARNESS

Swings into view, hooked up with Eddie inside it. He jumps
from crouch to lift-off position and flops backwards.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Too soon.

Then flop forwards.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Too late.

Then falls to the floor with a THUMP.
PEARY (CONT'D)
Dead on.
EXT. GARMISCH 40M SLOPE - DAY
Eddie tries out his new Peary method all on his own at dawn.

EDDIE
Up, back, forward, down.

Off he flies and the improvement is stunning. For the first
time he knows he can really do this.
INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Peary’s hungover face - the morning battlefield of shame and
denial as he makes his coffee.
35.

He reaches for his flask to top up his cup only to realize
Eddie standing nearby. Peary covers seamlessly by extracting
a tiparillo and firing up his Bic.

PEARY
About last night...

He laughs - alone. Eddie is strangely elated, and strangely
still. No pacing up and down.

EDDIE
I think you should know I’m going
to Calgary in February.

PEARY
To watch?

EDDIE
To jump.

Peary blows out a smoke ring. This should be interesting.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I’ve got a golden opportunity.

Eddie leans forward, lowering his voice.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Britain doesn’t have a jumping
squad.

Peary leans forward, lowering his voice.

PEARY
I know.

EDDIE
So I don’t have to compete for a
place, do I?

PEARY
They must have some minimum
requirements. Distance, number of
jumps... Talent.

Eddie shakes his head.
EDDIE
BOSA hasn't updated the rules in 52

years.

Eddie steps back. Waits to see how Peary deals with this
bombshell.
PEARY
Eddie, “mate”, the smallest Olympic
jump is the 70m. Even the average
jumper takes four years to build up
to it.

EDDIE
I’m not the average jumper.

PEARY
Correct. You are well, well below
average.

36.

He turns away, trying to get some booze into his coffee
without Eddie seeing... But Eddie insists on following him.

EDDIE
I can do it. It only took me a day
to do the 40.

PEARY
Then go do it already.

EDDIE
Okay, then. I will.

PEARY
I mean now.

Eddie comes to a stop. This is his big chance and he
it.
EDDIE
Seriously. The 70. I have your
permission?

PEARY
Be my guest.

We push in on Eddie as he builds up his courage.

EDDIE
I’m not kidding.

PEARY
Neither am I.

The two men - nose to nose, neither one moving.

EDDIE
Great.

PEARY
Super.

knows
37.

EDDIE
Terrific.

Eddie turns and heads for the door. Peary swiftly empties his
flask into his coffee as he follows.

EXT. GARMISCH 70M JUMP - DAY

The game of bluff continues at the base of the 70m tower.
Eddie, now in his makeshift jumping gear, gathers up

his skis.

EDDIE
No tips?

PEARY
You’re the expert.

Peary sipping his coffee, ‘miraculously’ mellow again. Eddie
starts up the steps.

EDDIE
You not coming up?
PEARY
I find the optimum view is from the

bottom.

Peary saunters down the slope and joins some of the less
boorish Swedes, who have gathered to watch.

LARS
He’s not actually going to jump
that, is he?

PEARY
Not a chance.

They're not sure they understand. Peary speaks to them in
Swedish. A subtitle reads: “Just a little game of Call My
Bluff.”

EXT. GARMISCH 70M JUMP/PLATFORM - DAY

Up close, Peary seems to be right. Eddie emerges onto the
platform, bravado waning as he looks down the ramp — a sheer

drop as high as a tower block.

He grips the railings, his stomach tightening, the icy wind
blasting his face.

Peary waves to the Swedes gathering at the base of the tower.
38.

PEARY
I wouldn’t stand too close if I
were you.
(he points at a bald ski
technician)

Especially you.

They look up, confused, just as Eddie goes white and stifles
a retch. The Swedes scramble backwards.

PEARY (CONT'D)
My mistake. False alarm.

Eddie slots the skis into the grooves on the starting
platform. The view from this angle is even more terrifying.

PEARY (CONT'D)
In your own time. No rush.

But Eddie stays stuck on the ramp, too scared to go forward,
too proud to go back.

MALE VOICE
The game is over now, yes?

Lars has arrived behind him.

EDDIE
Give us a push.

Lars looks at him confused.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
A push. It’s not hard. You just
stick out both hands and -
Eddie loses his balance and sends himself down the ramp.

The Swedes react first, then Peary.

PEARY
What the f---

Eddie instantly accelerates to 50mph. His knees shudder like
jackhammers as he thunders into the ‘tabletop’, still frozen
in a crouch, skis screeching in the icy grooves.

He ROARS off the ramp and plummets to the slope for the
shortest 70m jump in history. Bouncing along, briefly
upright, before flipping over spectacularly.

The Swedes can only watch in horror as Eddie goes tumbling
past with a ski tip SMACKING him on the head.
39.

Lars peers over the top of the ramp. Sees Eddie motionless on
the ice.

Peary rushes over as Eddie rolls onto his back, face covered
with snow: “How was that?”

We push in on Peary’s stunned face.

PEARY (CONT'D)
You fucking idiot! What’s the
matter with you?

He’s never seen anything like it in his life. And Eddie knows
it.

Angry shouting breaks the moment as the Swedish coach charges
up, beetroot with rage.

SWEDISH COACH
“Damn, damn, damn. Do you have piss
in your head or what?”

PEARY
Alright. Take it easy. Everything's
under control.

Peary helps poor dazed Eddie off the slope. The Swedish
Coach's voice gets more high-pitched as he throws Eddie’s

skis after them.

SWEDISH COACH
Next time, I shove them under your
pistenbully.

PEARY
Look forward to it.

INT. GARMISCH EDDIE’S DORM ROOM - DAY
Eddie lies propped up in bed like a convalescent.

GERMAN ROOMMATE
Eduard? You have a visitor.

Peary enters and pulls up a chair.

PEARY
How’s the human cannonball?

EDDIE
Couple of aches and pains. No big
deal.
40.

He can barely speak his jaw it’s so swollen. Peary knows
better. He lifts the sleeping bag and blanket to reveal
Eddie’s purple swollen knees and even more swollen ankles
- covered in bags of frozen peas.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I blame the landing surface,
frankly.

Peary shakes his head as he inspects Eddie’s jaw, still
fascinated by this maniac.

PEARY
No one jumps the 70 first time out.
No one. Even Matti Nykanen took two
years and he was a prodigy.

EDDIE
This mean you’re going to coach
me properly?

Peary scoffs, but not unkindly.

PEARY
You can’t get to Olympics unless
you compete on the European
Circuit. Who’s got the dough for
that?

EDDIE
The only Olympic requirement is one
completed jump in a European
Circuit event. We can do that right
here.

Eddie hands him a flyer for the upcoming Garmisch Seniors
Tournament.

So it is.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
All the judges are Circuit
officials. It’s totally valid.

PEARY
What are you going to do? Strap on
a colostomy bag? Pretend you’re 82?

EDDIE
The last jump of the day is an open
event...

Peary looks up to see Eddie struggling to his feet.

PEARY
Where the hell are you going?
4l.

EDDIE
Training.

To Peary’s amazement, Eddie starts to put on his ski gear.

PEARY
You idiot. You’ve got a fractured
jaw.

EDDIE

I already thought of that.

He picks up his trusty pillowcase and RIPS it.

INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Peary sorts out an ice pack for Eddie’s swollen face, acting
like his amazement is really disapproval.

PEARY
No one jumps the 70 first time out.
No one. Even Matti Nykanen took two
years and he was a prodigy.

EDDIE
This mean you’re going to coach
me full-time?

Peary slaps the ice-pack onto Eddie’s cheek, making his
grimace.

PEARY
Eddie. You can’t get to Olympics
unless you compete on the European
Circuit. Who’s got the dough for
that?

EDDIE
The only Olympic requirement is one
completed jump in a European
Circuit event. We can do that right
here.

Eddie indicates a poster for the Garmisch Seniors Tournament.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
All the judges are Circuit
officials. It’s totally valid.

PEARY
What are you going to do? Strap on
a colostomy bag? Pretend you’re 82?
42.

EDDIE
The last jump of the day is an open
event...

And with that final bit of news, Eddie gets to his feet,
collects his skis and heads right back out to the slope.

EXT. GARMISCH 40M SLOPE - NIGHT

Eddie trudges back up the stairs for another jump. Drenched
in sweat, teeth gritted against the pain, pillowcase tied
around his head.

Peary watches, puffing on a cigarillo.

Beer-drinking TEENAGERS blow wolf-whistles at Eddie, but he
just flicks them a V-sign and carries on — a lone but defiant
figure under the floodlights.

EXT./INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Peary returns to contemplate his drab workshop... And in a
way his life. The empty bottles, the rusty engine parts, the
sheer self-defeating clutter...

There’s no hiding from it any longer. He picks up a tool,
settles down to a long night’s work.

INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Peary leads Eddie in to unveil a new home-made harness
dangling from the ceiling. Eddie is profoundly touched. Lost

for words in fact. All this for him.

PEARY
But what would I know about it, eh?

Eddie climbs into the harness, trying it out.
PEARY (CONT'D)
Alright, first things first. Who's
your favorite female movie star?
Jane Fonda? Raquel Welch?

EDDIE
Honestly... Linda Gray.

Peary furrows his brow: Who?

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Sue Ellen from Dallas.
43.

PEARY
JR's wife?

Eddie nods, a little defensively. Peary YANKS the harness up
over Eddie’s crotch.

PEARY (CONT'D)

From here on, you're going to
approach every jump as if you’re
making love to Sue Ellen from
Dallas.

Peary uses his home-made miniature skier and ski-jump to
illustrate further —

PEARY (CONT'D)

The starting gate is your foreplay.
The in-run is where you build your
rhythm. The table-top is where you
head for home. And the lift-off is
your orgasm. Same facial
expression. Same straining of the
muscles. Same peaceful feeling of
release — if you do it properly.

Eddie's nods. Er, okay.
PEARY (CONT'D)
And as with any act of lovemaking,
there's only one way to tell if
you've done it properly...?

EDDIE
You fall asleep?

This doesn't get a laugh.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
She falls asleep.

Neither does this. Peary lets out a deafening cry of release.

PEARY
Abhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhbhhhhhh!

It’s a unique primal mix of war cry and sexual ecstasy...
PEARY (CONT'D)
Come on, let me hear you! Crouch.
Clench. RELEASE!

Eddie lifts off with an exhausted little grunt.
44,
PEARY (CONT'D)
Whoa.
Everything grinds to a halt.
PEARY (CONT'D)
The most shattering physical and
emotional experience of your life,
and that's the noise you make?

Eddie fiddles with his harness strap.

EDDIE
In England, yeah.

Peary walks back over to him.
PEARY
Rule number one. All the hi-tech
gadgets in the world don’t mean
squat if you’re not feeling it
here.

He thumps Eddie in the chest and lets rip.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

He keeps going until Eddie joins in, thumping Eddie in the
chest again as he gets louder and louder.

EDDIE/PEARY
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh -
EXT. GARMISCH STREET - NIGHT

One by one, lights snap on in the neighboring dorm rooms.

EXT./INT. GARMISCH VARIOUS - DAY
Eddie does squat jumps in the snow.
Pins up a poster of Sue Ellen from Dallas.

Watches Peary use his little home-made skier to show when
not to pull up your skis.

PEARY
Too soon... Too late...
45.

EXT. GARMISCH 40M JUMP - DAY
Peary winces as Eddie shoots off a jump.

PEARY
Too soon.

INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Eddie sits on a sofa with two black eyes. Peary shows him
video footage of Matti Nykanen in action.

He is a blue-eyed boyish enigma. And insanely brilliant.

EXT. GARMISCH SLOPE - DAY

Eddie races to the jump, full of inspiration... Peary watches
and winces doubly hard.

PEARY
Too late.

He turns away to hide his expression only to meet the
appalled stare of the Swedish Coach.

SWEDISH COACH
“Haven’t you got a toilet to go
clean?”

DOWN AT THE BOTTOM
Eddie finds his boots and straps have finally snapped.
EDDIE
(to the Swedes)
Any chance of borrowing some
equipment?
SWEDES

Screw off English! Go take a
bollock! Go play with your wanker!

INT. GARMISCH SENIORS REGISTRATION - DAY

A line of spindly, spry OLD PEOPLE. Eddie registers for the
Seniors Tournament, his face swollen and purple.

SIGNING-IN OFFICIAL
For sure, he is okay for this?
46.

PEARY
(indignantly)
He’s the national squad captain.

It’s a modest easygoing crowd. Lots of geriatric laughter and
missing teeth. And the odd recovering Jumper in a wheelchair
and plaster cast.

Eddie tries to hide his nerves as Peary preps him at the base
of the tower.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Remember. You’re only one jump away
from the Olympics.

Eddie puts on his battered old helmet. He’s customized the
chin strap with a big piece of sponge.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Just stay focused and do what we've
done in training only better.

He slides Eddie’s chin strap into place.
PEARY (CONT'D)
A lot better.
INT. GARMISCH 70M TOWER - DAY

Antique jumpers bound up the stairs past Eddie as he psyches
himself up.

EDDIE
You're only one jump away... You’re
only one jump away.

EXT. GARMISCH 70M SLOPE - DAY

Peary takes his place next to the MEASURING OFFICIALS, who
are uniformly short intense men, who take measuring jumps
very seriously.

EXT. GARMISCH TOP OF THE 70M - DAY

On the wind-swept platform, a bunch of OLD TIMERS laugh it
up. One OLD SKIER turns to Eddie to share the joke.

OLD JUMPER
He says, “You must treat every jump
as if it’s your last.” We are
saying, for us, that is easy.
47.

Eddie stares down the gut-churning icy ramp.

EDDIE
And for me.

OFFICIAL
Edwards!

A OFFICIAL points at Eddie. It’s time.

PA ANNOUNCER
Our next jumper is Eddie Edwards
from... Great Britain.

The Measuring Officials snap into position — eyes fixed
on the landing area. Peary discreetly mutters a prayer for
good luck.

The horn blares, the light goes green and off Eddie goes.
Peary can’t help mime everything that Eddie should be doing.

PEARY
Arms back. Chest down. Fanny in...
And lift. Lift!

Eddie does not lift. He loses his nerve and shuts his eyes,
so he stays frozen in a crouch and SMACKS down onto the
slope, a good 30 meters above the normal landing position.

The Measuring Officials, who never make a mistake, are
completely caught out. The crowd too. That was the shortest
jump they’ve ever seen.

Eddie rockets past their dumbstruck faces, eyes still closed,
to cross the red line and technically complete his jump.

ANNOUNCER
Eddie Edwards — 48 meters.

The crowd still can’t believe it. Eddie opens his eyes as he
comes to stop. Catches Peary look of relief. And it only gets
better.

ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)

That is a new British record for a
competitive jump.

(not quite covering the

microphone)
This has to be mistake.

(a hasty consultation)
No, that is correct — 48 meters. A
new British record for a
competitive 70m jump.
48.

The crowd bursts out laughing. Even more so when Eddie leaps
up and down with joy. Who is this crazy guy? The OFFICIAL
PHOTOGRAPHER scurries forward to get a picture. Click!

EXT. GARMISCH SLOPE - DAY

Eddie is back teaching his class and Peary's influence has
begun to show.

EDDIE
Come on, you’re acting like a bunch
of robots! Technique doesn’t mean
squat if you don’t feel it here.

He THUMPS his chest. A row of kids, crouched in the snowplow
position, peer up at him wide-eyed.

PEARY
Eduardo.

Peary appears waving a clutch of letters and a newspaper.

INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - LATER

Peary and Eddie hunch over a Daily Mail sent from home and
find his photo — hamming it up — under “Jumping for Joy”:

PEARY
“Plucky plasterer ‘Fast’ Eddie
Edwards set a new British record in
ski-jumping last week at Garmisch,
Germany, jumping 48 meters on the
normal hill. The previous record
was set back in 1929 by Hector
Moonie."

EDDIE
"Plucky plasterer.”
(liking the sound of it)

Peary points to an envelope in the rest of Eddie’s mail
stamped with the BOSA logo. What’s that?

Eddie slits it open and pulls out an embossed letter.
49,

EDDIE (CONT'D)
"Dear Mr. Edwards, We are writing
to inform you that in the interests
of safety we have ratified a
minimum distance of 61 meters to be
achieved in European Circuit
contests as the qualification for
all future British ski-jumping
contestants in Olympic
competition..."

Eddie has to read it again to be sure.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
“Minimum distance?”

Peary grabs the letter and reads for himself. One figure
leaps out from the page. 61 meters. 61 meters.

INT. GARMISCH BAR - NIGHT

Peary sits back in his regular spot, steadily sipping his way
through a bottle of schnapps.

PEARY
So much for your golden
opportunity.

EDDIE
Don’t be like that. I’11l just go
back and talk to them. Sort it out
face to face.

PEARY
You use the same approach when you
were doing downhill?

He takes another sip. Lights up a tiparillo.

EDDIE
This is different.

PEARY
How?

Eddie shouts over the babble of incoming Swedes as he leaves.

EDDIE
They're dealing with the British
Record Holder now!

He leaves. Peary ponders his reflection in the bar mirror. He
seems to be taking this harder than Eddie.
50.

INT. BOSA HQ - DAY
A seated row of BOSA officials, all in green blazers.

Eddie sits opposite, perched on a single chair. Knotted tie,
Argyle V-neck, combed hair — his dressed to impress look.

Heading this row of flunkies is Dustin Target.

TARGET
Mr. Edwards, this is a pointless
conversation. Our sponsors pay to
be associated with hard-earned
success, not some ridiculous side-
show, however well intentioned.

Eddie grits his jaw.

EDDIE
Why do I suddenly stop being
ridiculous at 61 meters?

TARGET
You won’t reach 61 meters.

EDDIE
I shouldn’t have to reach anything.
I’m the only one in Britain doing
the event!

TARGET
That was the distance ratified by
our Health and Safety committee.

Target indicates a PORKY AIDE sitting at the end.

Eddie’s face: “He’s Health and Safety?” Target gets to
his feet.

TARGET (CONT'D)
Our position could not be clearer.
We will not put amateurs in with
the real athletes.

More chairs scrape back. The meeting is adjourned.
EDDIE

I thought the Olympics was for
amateurs...
51.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

A steaming pot of tea — untouched. Eddie sits at the kitchen
table with his parents.

TERRY
So the only way to qualify is to
make 61m in a European competition?

Eddie nods.

TERRY (CONT'D)
And how much is that going to cost?

EDDIE
Not too much. It’s mostly entrance
fees and a bit of travel —

TERRY
But more than you can afford.

Eddie doesn’t deny it. Terry picks up a Prince Charles salt
shaker.

TERRY (CONT'D)
Well, answer me this. If this is you
now —

He mimes Prince Charles jumping off the teapot spout to the
middle of the table.

TERRY (CONT'D)
How much more are they asking you
to jump?

Eddie can’t lie. He ‘jumps’ the Lady Diana pepper shaker all
the way to the edge of the table.

Janette and Terry look at this huge gap. This impossibly
huge gap.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eddie lies on his bed, flicking through well-thumbed pages of
photos — Mary Peters, Lasse Viren, Dick Fosbury...

It’s his old Olympics album, Moments of Glory. The same book
he pored over as a kid.

He arrives at 1960 triple gold medallist Wilma Rudolph from
Tennessee —

"The Black Gazelle."
52.

A strikingly fit black woman, the 20th of 22 children, but
also amazingly —

“a polio sufferer who couldn't even walk
until she was eight."

Eddie gazes deeply at the photo of Wilma taking gold in Rome
- “the fastest woman in the world” - and even more deeply at
the photo of Wilma as a young girl, standing in a pair of leg
braces. Just like the ones in the hall closet.

INT. LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

Terry and Janette sit by their pewter Flickerflame gas fire
in matching armchairs.

TERRY
So he’s no better off than when he
left, is he?

JANETTE
Like that’s going to stop him.

She wants to go back to her knitting but can’t. He wants to
go back to his copy of Plasterer's Monthly, but can’t either.

JANETTE (CONT'D)
We're just going to have to face
it. He’s an obsessive.
Terry grunts.
TERRY
Yeah. I wonder where he gets that
from.
He looks at her surrounded by shelves of royal china.

JANETTE
Yeah. I wonder.

She looks at him surrounded by swirly stucco walls and
ornate brickwork.
INT. HALLWAY - DAWN

Eddie carries his gear to the bottom of the stairs. This
time, Janette and Terry are both waiting for him.

JANETTE
If we can’t stop you, at least we
can support you.
90

53.

She holds out a check, which catches Eddie completely
offguard.

EDDIE
++. You don’t have to do this.

TERRY
That’s what I said.

Janette throws him a look. Turns back to Eddie.

JANETTE
Just come back in one piece.

Eddie sees the amount on the check and reacts. It’s sizeable.
Janette pushes the check into his hand.

TERRY
That was going to be for your first
van after you got your diploma.
Terry lets out a sigh.
TERRY (CONT'D)
That was the other dream I had.
EXT. MOTORWAY - DAY
A truck motors down the autobahn, splashing through puddles,
ferrying Eddie back to Garmisch.
INT. TRUCK - MOVING - DAY
Eddie sits in the front seat. Headphones on, deep in thougIf0.
One knee bouncing up and down.
INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
Peary idly tinkers away under a solitary work lamp. Lonely,
bored, drunk. Eddie enters, fresh off the truck. Peary looks

up and takes in Eddie’s pensive expression.

PEARY
Let me guess. BOSA didn’t budge.

Eddie takes in the empties and the mess, somewhat taken aback
at the squalor.
54.

EXT. GARMISCH 70M PLATFORM - NIGHT

The twinkling lights of the resort. Eddie and Peary sit atop
the 70m, drinking cups of ‘fortified’ coffee from Peary’s
Thermos.

PEARY
I think it’s a good thing, to be
honest. It means now you’ve
got to do it for real.

Eddie sips his drink, in no mood to be consoled.

EDDIE
It was different for you. You were
a champion. You were always good. I
got kicked off every team I was on.
And the one thing I thought I was
good at — ruddy downhill — they
wouldn’t even take me.

PEARY
They're not exactly begging
you now.

Eddie looks down, toying intently with his cup. Peary pulls
out his schnapps bottle. Adds some more to his coffee.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Believe it or not, I do know what
it’s like to be written off.

Eddie glances up. A rare glimpse of the real Peary
underneath.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Of course, my solution was to come
here and screw everything that
moved...

He gives a worldly laugh, but it quickly evaporates. Eddie
goes back to toying with his cup.

EDDIE
I was in a hospital for a year when
I was a kid. Dodgy knees. All the
doctors told me to forget about
sport and take up reading.

Eddie pauses, reliving the moment.
55.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
So I did. First book I got was
the official 1972 Olympics photo
album —

EDDIE/PEARY TOGETHER
Moments of Glory.

Peary knows the title all the well.

PEARY
That was the book I got written
out of.

EDDIE

That was the book that made me
realize I needed my own “moment.”
That one thing I could do to prove
them all wrong.

Peary watches Eddie lift his hot metal cup to reveal five
interlocking rings in the iced platform.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I’ve never changed my mind since.

EXT. BOTTOM OF THE 70M - NIGHT

The clang of unsteady feet as Peary and Eddie descend the
stairs. They get to the bottom.

A pause. Peary has something to say too. He puts an arm
around Eddie’s shoulder.

PEARY
Eduardo, mein freund. I'll get you
your moment.

Off they weave, down the slope to the lights below.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY
Music swells as we sail over a snowy mountain road.

PEARY (VO)
We've only got three contests to
make your distance before the
Olympic cut-off date. Seefeld, St.
Moritz and Oberstdorf. Two months.
Three jumps. That’s it.
56.

A caravanette hatchback comes into view — the Garmisch
maintenance van.

INT. CARAVANETTE - MOVING - DAY

Peary does the driving. Eddie handles navigation.

On a map, Peary has marked the jumps in sequence — 1, 2, 3.

EXT. SEEFELD SLOPE - DAY
Eddie does brutal squat thrusts and leaping star jumps.

PEARY (VO)

I was letting you push off later
because it gave you more time for
your alignment. No more.

Peary demonstrates using a homemade model skier.

PEARY (VO) (CONT'D)
You've got to do it quicker and
stronger — with explosive
plyometric force.

Eddie doesn’t know what that means.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Like a mad salmon.

Eddie leaps — just like a mad salmon.

INT. SEEFELD SLOPE OFFICE - DAY

PEARY (VO)

Good start times! You’ll gain at
least a meter jumping on early
morning ice.

Eddie presents himself to a surprised OFFICIAL. Signs his
name on a clipboard.

PEARY (VO) (CONT’D)

So let’s get you registered as a
squad captain and claim a pole
position.

Eddie tries out his captain’s armband, just like the one that
Lars wears.
57.

INT. SEEFELD STREET - DAY
Peary drags Eddie along to a ski resort building.

PEARY
New equipment! Decent skis, proper
boots, aerodynamic jumpsuit,
streamlined helmet. This will gain
you at least two meters.

EDDIE
With what? We've barely got enough
left for entry fees and petrol.

PEARY
Who said anything about buying?

Eddie looks confused.

EDDIE
I already tried borrowing.

Peary leads Eddie past a sign for “Lost Property”.

PEARY
We're not borrowing. We’re
reclaiming.

INT. SEEFELD LOST PROPERTY DEPT. - DAY

Peary and Eddie root out various ski boots, a helmet, gloves,
a ski suit — recoiling at the musty smell.

PEARY
Size 11, right?

EDDIE
10.

PEARY
All they've got is 11.

He hands Eddie the boots. And six pairs of socks.

Eddie assembles his final selection. Notices Peary inspecting
his own selection in the mirror — an alpine sports jacket
with a distinctive zip-up collar. The preferred style for
European jumping coaches.

PEARY (CONT'D)
What? I just like the look,
that’s all.
58.

INT. SEEFELD CHANGING-ROOM - DAY
Eddie puts on his six pairs of socks and oversized boots.

He joins the circle at the captains’ meeting, proudly putting
on his armband.

One by one, the other captains react to their new colleague
and his kaleidoscope of mismatched gear. “Is this a joke?”
EXT. SEEFELD 70M JUMP - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE: “Contest No. 1 Seefeld.”

Eddie jumps and lands. Judging by Peary’s reaction — it’s an
instant improvement. Ugly, but definitely longer.

Peary gives Eddie the thumbs-up, resplendent in his new
distinctive high-collar jacket. It’s a little shabby, but
otherwise he looks just like the other coaches now.

SWEDISH JUMPER
Din javla idiot.

Peary flicks him an Eddie-style V-sign.

INT. CARAVANETTE - DAY

Eddie - an ice pack on each knee - writes a postcard home,
sketching a little diagram to show his progress...

INT. EDWARDS KITCHEN - DAY

«+. Janette hands Eddie’s postcard to Terry, sitting behind
his copy of Plasterers’ Monthly.

Then she moves Prince Charles a full two inches towards Lady
Di at the edge of the table.

INT. SEEFELD PRESS ROOM - DAY

Eddie expertly plunders the free food. Peary, even more
expertly, plunders the open bar. Until a voice on one of the
TV monitors catches his attention....

He looks up to face the moment he’s been dreading for 20
years. A silver-haired MAN on screen. The TV caption reads
“Warren Sharp, Former US Olympic Coach”.
59.

Sharp is being welcomed aboard the ABC Sports commentary team
for Calgary. Peary goes quite still as he takes in Sharp’s
immense patrician presence. Hurtling back into his past...

INT. CARAVANETTE - NIGHT

It's small, but they've made it like home. Makeshift clothes
line. Posters of Matti Nykanen and Linda Gray on the wall.

Eddie shivers in his sleeping bag, swaddled in mittens and
scarfs, breath misting the windows.

EDDIE
“I’m going outside. I may be some
time.”

Not even a smile from Peary, lost in his thoughts.

INT. SKI RESORT STORE - DAY

Eddie peruses postcards, gulping milk. Peary discreetly
unbags his new book - Sharp Words: The Coaching Wisdom of
Warren Sharp.

He studies the back cover photo of Sharp — the archetypal
straight arrow coach. His unforgiving eyes drilling deep into
Peary’s conscience...

EXT. SLOPE - DAY

Swirling snow fills the sky. Peary and Eddie two dots on the
wind-swept landscape.

PEARY
We have to keep working on your
Telemark landing. It’s key.

EDDIE
It’s too complicated. The other way
feels better.

PEARY
Yeah, but it’s not correct.

Eddie looks at Peary, unsure where this sudden pedantry is
coming from.

EDDIE
What happened to ugly but
effective?
60.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

The caravanette WHOOSHES past, more slowly now as it heads
uphill...

PEARY (VO)
You plateaued sooner than I
thought. The more you push now, the
worse you make it. The only way
forward is better technique.

EXT. SLOPE - DAY
Eddie practices the Telemark landing - knees bent, one leg in
front of the other - without skis. Again and again under

Peary’s exacting, precise direction.

EDDIE
Christ. When did you get so fussy?

Peary ignores him. Just keeps correcting and adjusting.

PEARY
How does it feel now?

EDDIE
Robotic.

Off Peary’s glare -

EXT. ST. MORITZ 70M JUMP - DAY
SUPERIMPOSE: “Contest No. 2 St. Moritz.”

PEARY (VO)
(losing patience)
Precision is what sets you free.
Form and function combined.
Otherwise you just snatch at your
lift-off and make it worse.

We travel all the way down the scoreboard to last place —
“Edwards, E. — 53m.”

INT. EDWARDS KITCHEN - DAY

Terry butters his toast with a plasterer’s precision. Looks

up to see Janette move Prince Charles backwards from Lady Di
— awhole inch. Terry’s face: What did I tell you?
61.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

The caravanette sits parked in a muddy field, rain drumming
on the roof.

INT. CARAVANETTE - NIGHT

Peary sips his drink and lights another tiparillo. Eddie
fidgets noisily with the model skier as he ponders his
progress chart — or rather lack of progress chart.

The air is thick with fatigue and mutual frustration. And the
odd leaking raindrop.

PEARY
Attitude is altitude. You can’t
move forward if your head’s not
right.

What is Peary talking about?

EDDIE
We've only got three weeks left!

Peary’s well aware of the pressure. And he’s not coping so
great either. He tops up his glass.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Like that’s going to help.

PEARY
Well, look at the raw material I
got to work with.

Eddie snaps. Hurls the little ski model into Peary’s glass,
splashing it all over Peary’s shirt.

EDDIE
Some coach you are.

Peary leaps to his feet, banging his head on the low ceiling.

PEARY
It’s ski jumping, not bungee
jumping!

EDDIE
Since when did it have to be Swan
Lake?

Peary’s face tightens. Water dripping off him. Something has
snapped in him too.
62.

PEARY
Eddie. You have a self-limiting
belief.
Eddie can’t believe what he’s hearing.
PEARY (CONT'D)
A self-limiting belief that keeps
you small.
Peary peels off his wet shirt and hands it to Eddie.

EDDIE
Like you're so bloody special.

Peary’s face: Oh really? The two of them, nose to nose once
more.

Very coolly, Peary picks up his drink. Pulls out the dripping
little ski model. Hands it to Eddie. Heads for the door.

EXT. SLOPE - DAY

Peary marches across the slope - no shirt, no shoes, drink in
one hand, tiparillo in the other. Eddie trailing after him.

EDDIE
Nice. Nice attitude. Very
professional.

Peary hands Eddie his glass.

PEARY
Here. Hold this.

He marches on to the base of the 90M jump. Points at a Jumper
changing into ski boots.

PEARY (CONT'D)
What size are those?

JUMPER
lls.

PEARY
Close enough.

He takes them and the guy’s skis and starts up the stairs.
Down below, the Swedes have gathered to watch.

SWEDISH JUMPER
What is this? Call My Bluff again?
63.

Eddie feels the glare of onlookers.

EDDIE
Do you mind?

Up at top of the ramp, Peary clips on his boots and slots in
his skis, tiparillo still in mouth.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Alright, Peary. You’ve made you’re
point. Very impressive. Thank you.

But Peary is only getting started. He crouches down, arms
back, palms up, and sets off... He’s like a great surfer,
the natural elegance undimmed by years away.

He shoots off the ramp, springing upwards, taut and beautiful
- no helmet, no shirt - flying past Eddie and the Swedes...
and flying... and flying...

The Swedes watch in awe. They all know pure style when they
see it.

Peary’s skis slap down in the most rakish version of a
Telemark landing anyone ever saw. Gliding to a halt with a
parallel skid and a perfect arc of spray.

Awed silence. Peary removes his tiparillo and taps the ash.
Takes back his drink from Eddie and takes a sip.

PEARY
I'm sorry. I interrupted you. You
were saying?

INT. CARAVANETTE - NIGHT

Eddie lies in his sleeping bag, awake, looking like he’s been
slapped. Peary is still up and so drunk, he’s turned mean.

PEARY
You're uncharacteristically quiet
tonight.

He offers the dregs of his bottle to Eddie, so forcefully
Eddie has to push it away.

EDDIE
I can see why they kicked you off
the squad now.

Peary’s eye narrow. Suddenly this is no longer fun.
64.

PEARY
If you really want to get to
Olympics so bad, just go jump the
90m yourself.

He clambers into his bed still with the bottle.
PEARY (CONT'D)

Your BOSA letter only said the

minimum distance had to be recorded

at a Circuit jump. It didn’t

specify what event.
He hits the light switch, drifting into sleep.

PEARY (CONT'D)

It’s perfect for you. You can do as

badly as you like and still make

the distance.
Out he goes. Eddie lies awake, fuming in the dark... Knee
bouncing up and down.
INT. CARAVANETTE - DAWN
Peary stirs awake in the morning light thanks to the empty
bottle hitting the floor. Finally, he notices the blindingly
obvious — Eddie’s bed is empty.
EXT. 90m JUMP - DAY
A ski-jump elevator takes Eddie up into the sunlight peeping
over the ridge. All the way to the top.
THE 90M START PLATFORM

is surprisingly small. There is just enough room to put on
his skis and shuffle into position.

Eddie moves out, bracing the wind, and takes in the view.
It's like nothing he could have imagined.
A vertigo-inducing ice-ramp that plunges down into infinity.

He steps forward, dislodging some ice from the metal grating.
The ice chunks fall... and fall... and fall...

Blood drains from Eddie’s face and a new expression fills his
features. One we've never seen before.
65.

Total fear.

THE ELEVATOR

hisses open behind him, producing a new JUMPER. A
preposterously young guy. He opens his palms at Eddie: What's
the delay?

Eddie is white as a sheet. The kid has to skirt around him.
He clicks on his skis and pushes off, he picks up speed at a
frightening pace then abruptly disappears from view.

A l-o-n-g moment later he flies back into view — SLAPPING
down onto the slope. A hard crunching landing. A fierce stop.
Real ski-jumping.

Eddie attempts to move into position. All he can hear is the
whistling wind. All he can feel is the metal structure
creaking beneath him. He fumbles for the rail.

A few deep breaths seem to do the trick. He regains his
composure, even managing a smile at his own silliness.

Then vomits spectacularly.

EXT. RESORT - DAY

Two figures pick their way through the crunchy morning snow.
It’s Peary and the resort JANITOR, who leads him into the
men’s restroom.

INT. RESTROOM - DAY

The Janitor opens the end cubicle door for Peary to step
forward to see for himself. Eddie is slumped on the floor by

the toilet bowl.

Peary considers Eddie’s ashen face. His trembling fingers
gripping the rim. This was not what he was expecting at all.

STEAM RISES UP
From a sink of hot water.

Steadied by Peary, Eddie splashes water over his face.
Slowly, he gets some color back in his cheeks.

Peary goes and gets him a wodge of paper towels.

PEARY
No more shortcuts.
66.

Eddie wipes his face. Looks up to face Peary’s gaze in the
misted mirror and finds his coach is surprisingly empathetic.

PEARY (CONT'D)
We're just going to have to dig
deeper, that’s all.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

The caravanette chugs uphill across the border into Germany,
black clouds in the distance.

PEARY (VO)
You need to get used to skiing at
50-60mph.

Peary stands at the top of a mountain road with Eddie.
Nothing to see but more mountain tops in any direction.

EDDIE
Don’t we need a wind tunnel for
that?
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

Eddie’s grimacing face - jowls flapping. His skis have been
bolted to the roof of the caravanette.

Peary at the wheel, bombing downhill.

PEARY
Louder. I can’t hear you!

EDDIE
Arrrrghhhhhhhhhh!

The caravanette speeds past the sign for Germany, black
clouds in the distance.

INT. CARAVANETTE - MOVING - DAY

Peary and Eddie wear waterproof plastic sheets. Rain leaking
everywhere now.

They pull up outside an old Gothic building with a sign in
German and English that says “Health Spa.”

PEARY
Look at all the best jumpers.
They're tall, wide and thin.
(MORE )
67.
PEARY (CONT'D)
Like a sail. Whereas you, you're
built like a linebacker...
Peary gives Eddie’s broad shoulders a squeeze.
PEARY (CONT'D)
You, my husky bricklaying friend,
are going on a diet.
INT. HEALTH SPA - DAY
A SCALE pings to 188lbs. Eddie is getting weighed.

Peary can barely get his pinkie inside Eddie’s waistband.

EXT. HEALTH SPA - DAY

Eddie sets off on a run, wrapped in a plastic trash bag. He
passes OBESE PATIENTS, taking the cure. “Slow down!”

INT. HEALTH SPA - DAY

Eddie’s head pokes out the top of a sweat box. Peary wipes
his steamed up glasses.

PEARY (VO)
Private Edwards, you are a thigh-
chafing horror.

EXT. HEALTH SPA - DAY

Eddie does press-ups while an OBESE GUEST in a tracksuit
offers him pointers.

PEARY (VO)

Gargantuan. Obese. Disgusting. What
are you?

INT. SPA KITCHEN - DAY

EDDIE
Starving.
Peary feeds raw spinach into a blender... And a raw egg...
And a whole lemon... And cayenne pepper...

Eddie gulps down a glass of the green liquid wincing.
68.
A tempting box of chocolate Jaffa Cakes sits on the table. A
gift from Mum. Peary removes them from view.
PEARY
Not until you qualify.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Eddie runs downhill, Peary driving alongside.
PEARY
No rest until every pound of

quivering blubber is gone!

Coming back up the hill, Eddie easily outruns the
caravanette, forcing Peary to shout after him.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Vanished! Purged! Finito!

INT. HEALTH SPA - DAY

Peary prods Eddie past a sign for "Hydro-Colonics."

PEARY

Every pound you lose is a meter
gained!

INT. HEALTH SPA - DAY

The scale BOINGS to 175lbs. Peary gets two whole fingers
inside Eddie’s waistband.

PEARY
How do you feel now?

EDDIE
Weak.
EXT. OBERSTDORF SLOPE - DAY
SUPERIMPOSE: “Oberstdorf Practice Jumps.”

Various squads and coaches arrive to begin their
preparations.

The Swedes gather round their coach, but Lars’s gaze keeps
straying over to Eddie.
69.
The new streamlined Eddie. Already hard at work on the slope.
Valiantly doing as Peary instructs. Not complaining once.

Just like a real athlete.

INT. OBERSTDORF CHANGING-ROOM - DAY

Eddie gets undressed, exhausted from another long day,
stomach GROWLING, tighty-whiteys slipping off his new
slimline frame.

Behind him, nonchalantly nude as usual, Lars strolls up
holding out a shiny new pair of Atomic skis.

LARS
You could maybe use these, I think.

The skis are gleaming, unused — and bright pink.
LARS (CONT'D)
Proper jumping skis. With
lightweight tips. For better
balance.

Eddie waits for the punchline, but it doesn’t come.

EDDIE
You sure? These things cost a
fortune.

LARS

The sponsors take care of it.

He thrusts the skis at Eddie, who runs a hand over their
gorgeous dimensions.

EDDIE
They're beautiful.

Lars shrugs — the nearest he’ll ever get to an overt display
of emotion — and leaves Eddie to it.

After a moment, Eddie ‘comes to’ and realizes Lars has
already gone. He turns to one of the other Swedes.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Quick. How do you say "Thank you
for the skis" in Swedish?

INT. OBERSTDORF SHOWERS - DAY

Lars ambles nudely to the shower.
70.

EDDIE
Lars!

Eddie chases after him, still clad only in his Y-fronts.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Det var som fan sansldés.

A subtitle reads: “Bugger me till I faint.”

Lars blinks in surprise, which only emboldens Eddie to
squeeze Lars's shoulder more warmly.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Det. var. som. fan. sanslés.

EXT. OBERSTDORF 70M JUMP - DAY

Eddie is all ready to jump with his shiny new skis, but
the JUMP MARSHALL has a clipboard full of forms to be
signed first.

EDDIE
It’s a practice jump! You don’t
paperwork for a practice jump!

JUMP MARSHALL
At Oberstdorf, we do everything to
the letter.

EDDIE
I could have done two jumps by now.

Peary drags Eddie aside before he makes things worse.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I can’t help it. I’m bloody
starving.

PEARY
Take a breath. Relax. Remember:
Focused not tense.

A much improved WHOOSH sees Eddie shooting off the slope in
his shiny new pink skis.

It’s not a great lift-off, but he stays aloft appreciably
longer, and lands at 61 meters — the magical distance.

EDDIE
And that was without a headwind!
71.

PEARY
Alright, don't get cocky. Your new
skis did most of the work.

The Jump Marshall signals the distance on his electronic
board - “61 meters.” The magical distance.

Eddie erupts with joy, but he’s so weak, he falls into
Peary’s arms.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Do that tomorrow and you’re
through.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Prince Charles CLINKS into Lady Di, so he’s right next to
her. Terry exchanges a tense look with Janette. Fingers
crossed.

INT. SPA BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eddie lies wide awake. Staring at the ceiling, stomach
growling like a bear.

He gets up, careful not to wake Peary, and digs out the
parcel of Jaffa Cakes — only to find a note attached from
Peary: "I said, Not until you qualify!"

It doesn’t matter. He’s felt so much self-belief.

EXT. OBERSTDORF 70M SLOPE - DAY

The arena fills up with officials, TV crews, spectators.
Competition day.

Peary rubs the overnight snow between his fingers. Sizes up
the headwind. It’s all good.

SUPERIMPOSE: “Contest No. 3 Oberstdorf.”

EXT. OBERSTDORF 70M JUMP - DAY

Eddie gets his armband with Lars and the other captains. And
his jumping position.

OFFICIAL
Number three: Klauser. Number two:
Moberg. Number one... Edwards.
72.

Wow. The prime start time.

EXT. OBERSTDORF 70M SLOPE - DAY
Eddie hurries to find Peary and tell him the good news.
EDDIE
Peary! You better get in position.
I’m first off.

He pulls up short like he’s seen a ghost. Two of them in
fact. It’s Target and his Aide in their bright green blazers.

TARGET
Can we take it you’ve acquired a
coach?
EDDIE/PEARY
Yes./No.
Pause.
PEARY

It’s not a formal arrangement.

TARGET
I should hope not. That would
require you to be licensed and
registered. It’s Peary, isn’t it?

Target flicks a glance at Peary’s ‘Lost Property’ chic.

TARGET (CONT'D)
Your old exploits on the US Olympic
squad are quite the talk in the
press tent.

Peary assumes his most nonchalant air.

PEARY
If I'd been French, they’d have
made me captain.

TARGET
If you’d been British, we'd have
never let you in the squad.

Peary and Eddie turn to watch as Target and his Aide walk
over to glad-hand — who else? — the asshole Swedish Coach.

PEARY
Back home, we have a word for guys
like that.
73.

EDDIE
We have the same word.

EXT. OBERSTDORF 70M JUMP/PLATFORM - DAY

Eddie settles into position. Flapping his arms, doing his
breathing warm-ups: “Ahhhhhhh!”

He sees Peary down below giving him the OK sign. Then catches
sight of Target and his Aide, which doesn’t help.

He tries to shut them out — “Focused not tense.” “Linda
Gray.” The light goes to green and he pushes off in his shiny
new skis.

Peary watches in gradually awakening amazement as Eddie soars
and hovers like never before.

Graceful, controlled, no trace of panic. It’s like he’s a
completely different athlete. He even pulls off a Telemark
landing — arms out, knee bent — which is simply a miracle.
Eddie skids to a stop and flips off his goggles. He sees
Peary’s face and sees his wonderment. Even better, there’s no
red flag from the Officials. The jump will stand.

EDDIE
What did I hit?

Peary completely forgot to register his distance.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
What was the distance?

Peary has no idea. Some of the Circuit crowd are doing their
usual patronising reaction — cries of “woo-hoo” and taunting
hand gestures.

But Peary doesn’t care. That was a genuinely decent jump.

Eddie though only has eyes for one thing. The distance. He
turns to the scoreboard as it clicks up.

“E. Edwards 57m.”

He blinks at this obvious mistake. But the announcer confirms
it. It’s a full 4 meters short.

Target turns to his Health and Safety Aide with relief. At
last, the nightmare is over.
74.

An OFFICIAL steers Eddie off the snow to make way for the
next jumper, but Eddie pushes him away. Wait. Wait. This is
all wrong.

EXT. OBERSTDORF FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Peary waits outside, while inside Eddie remonstrates with the
Event Officials, voices rising.

EDDIE
You don’t understand. This is my
only chance. You have to give me
another run.

They will not budge. The rules are the rules.

OBERSTDORF OFFICIAL
At Oberstdorf, we do everything to
the letter.

EDDIE
You all keep saying that! It
doesn’t help! These people at BOSA.
They're bastards! If it’s 61 this
year, it’ll be 71 next year. Then
81.

Eddie explodes, grabbing the man’s lapels, ending any chance
of clemency.

Peary watches all this, knowing it’s pointless, but that’s
okay. In some strange, wonderful way, this mad quest is
turning out better than he’d ever hoped.

INT. CARAVANETTE - NIGHT

The long drive back. Headlights moving through ghostly tree-
lined roads.

Eddie stares out the window, jaw clenched tight. The box of
Jaffa Cakes in his lap — unopened.

Peary looks over at Eddie, biding his time.

EXT. GARMISCH CARPARK - DAY

The caravanette noses to a stop right back where it
all began.

Except now, there’s only leaden skies and humdrum tourists
waddling about.
75.

INT. CARAVANETTE - DAY
Peary switches off the engine.
PEARY
Eddie, I want to tell you
something.

Eddie stares out the window like a zombie.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Your jump yesterday...

Peary has never looked more alive.
PEARY (CONT'D)
It was the first time you had all
your components working together —
lift-off, timing, balance,
trajectory. All of it, working
together like second nature.

Eddie can’t face any of this. He opens the door and gets out.
Peary reaches to pull him back.

PEARY (CONT'D)
You idiot. I’m telling you it was
the best jump you've ever done.

But Eddie’s already gone, hurrying out of sight.

EXT. GARMISCH RESORT - DAY
Wind blows across the slopes as the last Swedish flag is
taken down and their Olympic HQ packed up.

INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Peary sits at his desk, underlining key sections of his copy
of Sharp Words, jotting notes in the margins, a man reborn.

The sound of BANGING and SLAMMING intrudes. Peary looks over
to find Eddie hollering in his garage.

PEARY
Eddie. Cut it out. I’ve been doing
some thinking.

Eddie just keeps hollering like a maniac.
76.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Seriously. Enough with the
histrionics. I’ve figured out a way
forward —

Eddie appears in front of him, waving a Telex.

EDDIE
We did it. We’re through.

He’s not upset. He’s celebrating.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
They only recorded the bloody
practice jump.

He hands the telex to Peary. “E. Edwards, Great Britain,
Oberstdorf 61m.”

EDDIE (CONT'D)
It’s official. It counts.

Eddie charges out, banging the door, whooping with joy.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
“Everything to letter!”

Peary stands there, completely thrown. This is a disaster.

EXT./INT. CARAVANETTE - DAY

Matti Nykanen’s inscrutable blue eyes are unpinned from
the caravanette wall. Eddie rolls up his poster, unstoppable
now as he does his best Ron Pickering.

EDDIE
Oh this is amazing, this is
sensational.

Peary arrives at the van, now with a “For Sale” sign in the
front window.

PEARY
Eddie. What I said about your jump
— I meant it. We can do this for
real.

Eddie hums, dances, moonwalks as he packs up his gear.
PEARY (CONT'D)

You don’t have to settle for being
a novelty item anymore.
77.

Eddie just keeps bopping away as he packs his case.

PEARY (CONT'D)
We should take another four years.
Re-train you from the ground up.

EDDIE
What are you talking about?

PEARY
I’m saying I want to coach you for
the next four years. So we can go
and really compete.

Eddie finally starts to pay attention.

EDDIE
What for? We're already going.

PEARY
I’m saying, if you go now, they’re
never going to let you back.

EDDIE
So what?

PEARY
So all you can prove is that you
don’t mind coming last.

EDDIE
I don't mind!

Eddie can’t believe he’s trying to ruin this great moment.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
What’s the matter with you? We just
pulled off the impossible. Now we
get to be a part of it.

PEARY
I was a part of it. Remember?

The intensity in his voice takes them both by surprise.
PEARY (CONT'D)

It doesn’t mean anything if you
sell yourself short.
78.

EXT. GARMISCH CARPARK - DAY

A bus driver loads up luggage, ready for the drive back to
England. Eddie and Peary stand there, regarding each other
with equal frustration.

EDDIE
I don’t understand. Why can’t we
just go and have fun?

It’s a good question. And one Peary has already pondered.

PEARY
A year after I got bumped from the
Olympic squad, I went back to
Warren Sharp to apologize. I
literally got on my knees and
begged him to let me jump again.

Even now, it still stings.

PEARY (CONT'D)
You know the last words he said
to me?

This is the first time, we sense, Peary has said them aloud.

PEARY (CONT'D)
“You'll never take jumping
seriously, because you’1l never
take yourself seriously.”

Eddie digests the words and yes, they’re brutal.

EDDIE
They going to be your last words to
me, too?

The driver honks his horn. It’s time to go.

PEARY
Eddie. I got 20 years to make good
on. Either we do it right or not at
all.

EDDIE
You're crazy! Six months ago you
were driving a rust bucket.

They stand there. Each hoping the other one will cave.

PEARY
Eddie. Don’t be a fool.
79.

EDDIE
Better a fool than a coward.

The bus driver honks again. It really is time to go.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
At least wish me luck, you stubborn
bastard.

They hug awkwardly.

INT. COACH - MOVING - DAY

Eddie clamps on his headphones and folds his arms as the bus
moves off. How can a victory feel more like a defeat?

He can’t even bring himself to look back. Not even a farewell
glance at the windswept jumps.

EXT. EDDIE’S STREET - DAY

The street is strangely empty outside Chez Eddie, palace of
stucco. Just a voice yelling —

EDDIE (VO)
Hurry up, it’s starting!

INT. LIVING-ROOM - DAY

Packed inside are Eddie, Terry, various NEIGHBORS, KIDS and
Builders. Eddie's Mum enters with another round of tea and
Jaffa Cakes as -

ON TV, Eddie flaps his arms, jumping in a European contest.

UK NEWS REPORTER (ON TV)
This week, local boy Eddie Edwards
achieves a boyhood dream when he
heads off to Canada to compete in
the Winter Olympics in Calgary.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhh.” Eddie practices in his homemade harness in
the back garden, watched by the local Kids.

EDDIE (ON TV)
I've broken my arm, my jaw, three
fingers, two ribs, and eight pairs
of glasses.
80.

NEWS REPORTER (ON TV)
Even though he only finishes half
the distance of normal jumpers,
Edwards can look forward to
competing against the likes of
Finnish champion Matti Nykanen.
And can even expect to be cheered
on by Great Britain’s consort at
the Games, Her Royal Highness
Princess Anne.

On TV, a Gentleman's Outfitter slips an Olympic blazer onto
Eddie's shoulders.

OUTFITTER (ON TV)
Any pinching under the arms, sir?

Eddie shakes his head, proudly inspecting the breast pocket
crest. "Calgary 1988." Five Olympic rings and a Union Jack.

Just like in all the official British squad photos that fill
the walls.

Through all this, Terry and Janette exchange a look — quietly
humbled by Eddie’s achievement.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Eddie rechecks his airline ticket and passport for the last

time. When he struggles to close his ski bag, Terry comes and
grips it, so Eddie can pull the zipper shut.

TERRY
Wider than normal skis, aren't
they.

EDDIE

Yeah. For the wind resistance.

TERRY
Different buckles too. So you can
lift your heel at the take-off.

His dad is quite the expert, these days.

EDDIE
You sure you want to fly all that
way just to see me? I mean, it’s
not cheap.

TERRY
It’s already done. Call it an early
summer holiday.
81.

EDDIE
Yeah, but it's not the plastering
World Cup though, is it.

No, it's not. But they don’t feel it has to be anymore.

TERRY
I‘ll get this. You save your
strength.

Terry picks up Eddie’s bag and carries it downstairs. Eddie
takes one last look around his shrine. His lifelong dream
finally turning real.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

At the front door, Janette waits, as always, beaming with
pride.

JANETTE
And where do you think you’re
going, young man?

She gives Eddie a ferocious hug, her eyes tearing up. He
pulls a hankie out of his pocket.

EDDIE
Alright. Take it easy. You’re going
to see me in a week.

She dabs her eyes and blows her nose. Terry peers in from the
front door.

TERRY
Pull yourself together, woman.
We've got a farewell committee.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Eddie exits his front door to find a small curious crowd has
gathered. The local kids, a stray dog, the Indian family
opposite, a clutch of grannies, a passing milkman.

Eddie walks towards Terry’s mud-splattered van past their
silent inquisitive faces. A real crowd begins to ROAR,
getting louder and louder.
82.

EXT. STOCK FOOTAGE - DAY

Suddenly, we’re hurtling over the Calgary skyline towards
the McMahon Stadium and the teeming spectacle of the
opening ceremony.

A procession of runners brings in the Olympic Torch to light
the flame.

COMMENTATOR (VO)
Fifty-seven nations, 1,700 athletes,
60,000 spectators and more than two
billion TV viewers around the globe
— all have come together for the
15th Olympic Winter Games, where
today the words will be spoken, Let
the Games begin!

The flame is lit and the stadium erupts in a swirling display
of synchronized flag-waving.

Drummers, marching bands, polar bear mascots, singer Gordon
Lightfoot, sexy ice-skater Katarina Witt, the Jamaican
bobsleigh team and —

EXT. CALGARY 70M JUMP - DAY

Whoosh! A SKI-JUMPER flying through the air to reveal a
packed stadium below. Olympic flags. TV commentators.
Thousands of fans. This is so much bigger and NOISIER than
anything in Europe.

INT. CALGARY CHANGING-ROOM - DAY

Eddie waits, suited and ready to jump, his knee bouncing like
a jackhammer. Around him, athletes are prepped and massaged
by their coaches.

Being on his own, Eddie makes do with humming and fidgeting.

RON PICKERING (ON TV)
So here we are, kicking off the
men’s 70m ski-jump with the
legendary Matti Nykanen.

Eddie leaps up at the mere mention of his idol’s name.

RON PICKERING (ON TV) (CONT'D)
The 70m crowd has really come alive
at the sight of the Flying Finn.
Not what you'd call an accessible
figure.

(MORE )
83.

RON PICKERING (ON TV) (CONT'D)
Prefers to let his jumping do the
talking — and my word, here's his

first speech!

Eddie watches the TV monitor: Nykanen soaring for an eternity
— a near perfect jump.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
Oh, that’s big. That’s very big.
It's got to be at least 89 meters.

Nykanen's brilliance silences the other jumpers getting
ready, even the Swedes. They quickly turn to stretching,
checking their buckles.

All except Eddie, who is rapt by the sight of Nykanen as he
strides off — eerily boyish in close-up, and also eerily
unmoved by the crowd’s rapture.

OFFICIAL
Edwards!

A super intense OFFICIAL executes the now familiar pointing
routine to Eddie and then to the sky. You. Next.

EXT. CALGARY 70M JUMP/START PLATFORM - DAY

Eddie bounds up to the platform determined to enjoy every
second. This is his moment, right?

He gets to the rail and looks down on the biggest ski crowd
he's ever seen. 70,000 people and his parents, all waiting
for him.

RON PICKERING
Here he comes, Eddie Edwards. His
arrival in Calgary has already
caused quite a stir, I can tell
you. That homespun, idiosyncratic
jumping style has even inspired a
nickname —

Fans wave a placard: “Canada welcomes Eddie ‘the Eagle’
Edwards.”

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
“Eddie the Eagle.” Well, if ever
there was a moment to prove he’s
not an endangered species, this
is it.

Eddie waves to the crowd, hiding his nerves by hamming it up.
84.

EXT. VARIOUS - DAY

Around the world, people watch their TVs curiously — Eddie’s
neighbors, Florian, his old pupils.

EXT. CALGARY STADIUM - DAY

Around the stands, people watch curiously too — fans,
commentators, some of the British squad.

Target turns with a withering look to his porky Health and
Safety Aide.

TARGET
“He'll never make 61m.”

EXT. CALGARY 70M JUMP/START PLATFORM - DAY

The klaxon sounds and Eddie sets off down the slope, picking
up speed.

He flies into the air and flaps his arms with a mighty cry.
But it's more of a squawk as he SHOOTS into the air and
plummets to the slope.

He lands awkwardly and skids to a halt only when he THUMPS
sideways into the end billboard.

It's all over in five seconds and the silence is deafening.
The crowd, the commentators, the other athletes — all staring
in disbelief.

Until one by one they start cracking up. “What the f£*** was
that?” Americans, Canadians, Brits — all cracking up with
amused disbelief.

And the Swedish team, as always — totally impassive. They all
turn towards Lars: “You gave that guy skis?”

EXT. CALGARY 70M JUMP/SLOPE - DAY

Eddie lifts his goggles and automatically turns to get
Peary's reaction. But of course he's not there.

The score flicks up on the big screen: 55 meters. The crowd
applauds good-humoredly, but it's lame and Eddie knows it.

TARGET’S AIDE
Well, it could have been worse.
85.

Target’s not so sure as he watches Eddie hide his
disappointment by clowning it up for the crowd.
INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

A stream of smoke. Peary watches the TV replays of Eddie and
his forced bonhomie. Peary looks sad but resigned.

He turns back to his new reading material, Sharp Words: The
Coaching Wisdom of Warren Sharp.
INT. CALGARY CHANGING-ROOM - DAY

Eddie clatters back to the quiet of the changing-room, still
on a high.

He goes straight to his kitbag to find his celebratory
chocolate. A box of Jaffa Cakes all ready to go. But
something’s off and he knows it.

He catches sight of himself in the mirror. Away from the
crowd, he can’t hide it anymore. It should feel great and it
doesn’t.

EXT. OLYMPIC VILLAGE - DUSK

Eddie wanders along, fighting a growing sense of anticlimax.
He squints at his map, totally lost amid the geometric

athletes’ quarters.

He passes the Jamaican bobsleigh team, decked out in green
and yellow latex suits. They watch him go by very strangely.

Once Eddie's out of sight, we see why. The Jamaicans pull out
a huge joint.
EXT. OLYMPIC VILLAGE - NIGHT

Eddie finally locates his block, where a perky PR WOMAN is
waiting to greet him.

PR WOMAN
A-ha, the elusive Mr. Edwards,
where the hell have you been?

INT. PRESS CONFERENCE HALL - NIGHT

The PR WOMAN leads Eddie down a backstage hallway towards a
growing hubbub of expectation.
86.

EDDIE
Blimey, who else is doing the press
conference?

PR WOMAN

No one. It's just you.

Eddie notices a TV screen showing footage of him reading The
Sun at the top of a jump... doing his funny arm-flapping warm-
up exercises.

She beckons him into the room and a sea of flashbulbs
explode. "Eddie!" "Eddie!""Over here! This way!"

More than 130 photographers, TV cameramen and journalists are
crowded inside for the new star attraction. All bombarding
him with questions.

EXT. CALGARY - VARIOUS - DAY

TV REPORTER
The Winter Olympics descended into
French farce this week with the
outbreak of Eaglemania.

SINGING FANS ON TV
"Fly like an eagle... Let your
spirit carry me."

Eddie signs autographs and poses for pictures. With kids,
parents, even Mounties.

Watching in amazement around the globe are Eddie’s neighbors.
The builders. And the Obese Push-up Expert back at the spa.

OBESE GUEST
Heilige Scheie!

Eddie has a quiet dinner with his parents until flashbulbs
explode through the window.

TV REPORTER
Everywhere he goes the former
plasterer is provoking equal parts
amusement and derision.

Fans impersonate Eddie's arm-flapping. Make "four-eyes" faces
with their fingers. Give him an inflatable eagle.

TV TALKING HEAD #1
He's the Elton John of ski-jumping.
He gives the ordinary man in the
street hope.
87.

TV TALKING HEAD #2
If he’s anyone famous on skis —
it’s Benny Hill.

Eddie gets mobbed by showgirls. Gets presented with a real
eagle. Even when he’s on the toilet, a tape-recorder appears
under the door.

UK NEWS REPORTER
A hairdresser from Bristol is
claiming he was your lover for two
years? Any comment?

Eddie valiantly signs more autographs, buffeted by fans, who
surge round, spilling hot dogs and soda all over his
Olympic blazer.

Some of the other ATHLETES watch all this without comment.
Eddie thinks they’re doubtful about the crazy fans, but we
sense their reservations have more to do with him.

EXT. OLYMPIC VILLAGE - DAY

Eddie and his mother head towards the Olympic Village
laundromat carrying a basket of his clothes.

JANETTE
I don’t care who wants your
autograph. You’re not going to the
closing ceremony with mustard down
your front.

A team of SECURITY PERSONNEL make them wait while some VIP
Guest passes.

JANETTE (CONT'D)
Who is it, Katarina Witt?

Eddie cranes for a better look. No, it’s —

EDDIE
Bloody Nora.

Actually, it’s PRINCESS ANNE on a royal walkabout. And she’s
walking all the way over towards him.

PRINCESS ANNE
I know you. You’re our ski-jumper.

She shakes Eddie’s hand.
88.

PRINCESS ANNE (CONT’D)
You know, my son Peter’s just
starting skiing at the dry slope in

Cheltenham.
EDDIE
Get out of it. That’s where I
started.
(off the aide’s discreet
prompt )
--. Ma’am.

PRINCESS ANNE
Maybe you can give him some
lessons?

EDDIE
Love to. I'll even get hima
weekend discount.

PRINCESS ANNE
Just skiing. No jumping.

Eddie beams in royal-lover heaven. As for his Mother — she’s
gone as stiff as a board.

PRINCESS ANNE (CONT’D)
Mrs. Edwards? You must be very
proud.

Janette can only stare, too stunned to speak, still gripping
Eddie’s basket of underwear.

EXT. VARIOUS - DAY

Newspapers in every language tell Eddie’s story. Crowds mob
him. Frat guys MOON him.

TV TALKING HEAD
This guy isn’t embodying the spirit
of the Games. He's debasing it.

TV TALKING HEAD #2
Let’s not forget. The founder of
the Olympics was Baron de
Coubertin, not P.T. Barnum.

The crowd and media mob is now totally out of hand as BOSA
officials escort Eddie into the flag-draped Olympic HQ.
89.

INT. OLYMPIC HEAD OFFICE - DAY

The PR WOMAN is not so perky anymore. She looks anxiously
across at Eddie.

PR WOMAN
I’m not sure how to put this...

On the conference table is a fanned-out mass of tabloid
newspapers — Eddie’s antics all in print.

PR WOMAN (CONT’D)
The official photo session for the
British athletes is being held
tomorrow. And some of them don’t
think it’s such a good idea that
you attend.

She reluctantly pulls out a letter.

PR WOMAN (CONT’D)
In fact, they’ve signed a petition.

EDDIE
Let me guess, the downhill squad?

PR WOMAN
+. Not just them.

He takes the letter and reads. There’s four pages in total —
108 names. All of telling him to go home.

TARGET (VO)
You have to understand, these

athletes have been preparing their
whole lives to get to these Games.

EXT. BOSA OLYMPIC HQ - NIGHT

Target stands on the steps, addressing a cluster of reporters
and cameras.

TARGET
This is their chance to get the
exposure and sponsorship they need
to survive.

Watching from way back is Eddie.

TARGET (CONT'D)
They simply want to make sure it
doesn’t get hijacked by some
sideshow.

(MORE )
90.

TARGET (CONT'D)
Especially by someone with no
desire to compete as a genuine
athlete.

A voice blurts out from the rear -

VOICE
I have desire!

Target stops. Heads turn - curious, annoyed. But Eddie
doesn’t emerge from the shadows, riding out the awkward
silence until Target resumes.

TARGET
The Games are not about 15 minutes
of fame. They’re about a lifetime
of excellence.

The crowd turns back to the steps as Eddie slinks away
unnoticed.

EXT. CALGARY STADIUM - DUSK
The vast empty freezing cold stadium.

Eddie sits way at the back, a tiny solitary dot, hunched
against the icy wind, feeling like absolute shit.

His only company is a snowgroomer put-putting up and down the
slope. A steady rhythm that seems to say, What did I tell
you? What did I tell you?

In Eddie's lap is his battered copy of Moments of Glory. All
his treasured images of triumph. Victorious athletes getting
cheered and chaired aloft.

Terry slides into the seat next to him. Eddie barely looks up
from his book.

EDDIE
You were right. They don’t want me.

TERRY
They don’t know you.

Eddie looks up at the 90M jump, towering above them in all
its concrete and steel glory. And keeps looking up at it,
daunted but compelled. Building up to some kind of decision.

EDDIE
Those other athletes on the
petition. They’re not snobs.
They’re good people.
91.

Terry looks up at the 90 then back to Eddie, putting two and
two together.

TERRY
Are you thinking what I think
you're thinking?

Eddie takes a last look at Wilma Rudolph’s lung-busting face,
then back up at the towering 90.

EDDIE
Mum’s going to kill me.

Terry considers his only son, breath misting in the vast
arena, as tortured as he’s ever seen him.

TERRY
You leave her to me.

Eddie gets to his feet, his mind made up. He knows what he
has to do. We hear the discreet hush of camera-clicking —

INT. PRESS CONFERENCE HALL - DAY

Eddie has called a second press conference. This time, it’s
all business.

EDDIE
I’m not deluded. I do know there’s
plenty of athletes more deserving
of publicity than me. Which is why
I've decided not to do any more
press interviews.

Eddie adjusts his specs, like he always does before taking
the plunge.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Not until I’ve completed my 90m
jump on Saturday.

The room reacts. Half confused. Half delighted at the good
copy this potential fiasco will provide.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I’d only planned to do the 70m. But
as people wiser than me know,
taking part in the Olympics doesn’t
mean anything if you sell yourself
short. I like clowning around, I
admit it. But I like proving people
wrong better.
92.

He seeks out the German TV camera. Looks into the lens.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I didn’t come here as a novelty act
and I’m not going home as one.

INT. PEARY’S WORKSHOP - DAY

Peary watches from his work bench. On his TV, Eddie gets up
and leaves the press conference, a clamor of questions in
his wake.

Peary’s expression is hard to read until he gradually breaks
into a small but distinctly proud smile. No one else in the
bar can know or understands. But that doesn't diminish his
vindication. "We're on!"

INT. BOSA OLYMPIC HQ - DAY

Target and his Aide watch the end of Eddie’s televised press
conference with utter disbelief.

TARGET
He must be mentally ill. How else
can you explain it?

AIDE
I actually think he’s starting to
make some sense.

Target throws a look, appalled this disloyalty. Then reaches
for the phone.

TARGET
Get me Benjamin Pensotti at
Eventing Safety.

EXT. CALGARY 90M JUMP - DAY

Eddie runs against the wind with his kitbag and skis, a man
on a mission. He gets there just in time to make his practice
jump. It is all very regimented with clipboard officials and
allocated times.

But Eddie is blocked from entering. And only Eddie by the
looks of it.
93.

INT. EDDIE’S CALGARY BEDROOM - DAY

On a TV monitor, Dr. Benjamin Pensotti of the Eventing Safety
Commission explains:

DR. PENSOTTI (ON TV)
While the winds are this high, we
have decided the less experienced
jumpers should not jump.

EDDIE
High winds? That’s not even a stiff
breeze.

DR. PENSOTTI (ON TV)
It’s nothing personal. It’s
strictly a question of safety.

Eddie switches channels in disgust. All he gets is a news
report on the British athletes doing their photo call.

And an episode of Dallas dubbed into French.

And randomly, the Jamaican Bobsleigh team going down on their
heads.

INT. OLYMPIC VILLAGE - NIGHT

Endless fluorescent-lit corridors. Eddie contemplates the
contents of a vending machine — Big Turk, Coffee Crunch...

His fingers stray to the buttons to make a selection only to
be interrupted loudly by a ‘polite’ cough.

It's Peary, fresh off the plane, still with his travel bag.
He looks Eddie up and down, none too impressed.

PEARY
“Eddie the fucking Eagle.”

Eddie’s never heard such reassuring words.

INT. EDDIE’S CALGARY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Peary and Eddie get to work setting up base camp in the
kitchenette — ski wax, green diet drink, harness, etc.

EDDIE
It can’t be like the Seniors Jump.
It has to be a real jump.
94,

PEARY
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT
The 90m tower, all lit up like a fortress. Janette looks out
from her hotel window, trying to hide her nerves and failing
badly.
Terry sits at the bureau, customizing a shiny new ski helmet.
TERRY
Get some sleep, pet. I got it

covered.

He pops open a tin of varnish. Dips in a brush.

INT. EDDIE’S CALGARY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eddie’s single bed lies empty, stripped of its blankets.
Nearby, a fold-out bed stands unopened.

Instead, Eddie and Peary lie side by side on the floor, just
like in the caravanette.

The wind whistles outside, flapping the curtain. Neither one
can sleep and they have to acknowledge it.

EDDIE
Have a cigarillo if you want.

PEARY
It’s just jetlag.
(no it’s not)
Eddie fidgets noisily. Peary reaches out to stop him.

EDDIE
I can’t help it.

He really can’t. He rushes to the toilet. Heaves violently
into the bowl.

Peary has his own nerves to deal with. His hand hovers over
the flask in his bag... Somehow he refrains.

Eddie waxes his skis... Just like his Dad plastering the top
of a low wall.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Peary?
95.

PEARY
Eduardo.

EDDIE
Thanks for coming.

PEARY
What are you going to do? Jumping’s
my Sistine Chapel and you're my
brush.

Eddie heaves one last time. Gets back into his sleeping bag,
pale as a sheet. Outside the wind howls remorselessly.

EDDIE
You ever get the feeling you’ve
made the biggest mistake of
your life?

His questions hangs in the air. They continue to lie there,
lost in their private hopes and fears. We fade to black.

We fade back up: “Six hours later.”

Eddie and Peary are still staring at the ceiling, only now
the first rays of dawn are peeping through the curtain. Peary
gets to his feet and extends a finger: Listen.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
What is it?

He can’t hear anything. Which is precisely Peary’s point.

Eddie scrambles to his feet and pulls back the curtains. A
clear blue sky. Not a flag fluttering anywhere.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
They can’t use the weather as an
excuse now, can they.
Peary sets out Eddie’s breakfast, a glass of green sludge.
PEARY
Neither can we.

INT. CALGARY CORRIDOR - DAY

Olympic Officials go down the hall, delivering sheets of
paper at each door with a sharp KNOCK.
96.

OFFICIAL
Klauser. Start time... Puikkonen.
Start time... Edwards. Start

time...

Eddie opens his door to collect his start time and finds his
parents waiting there awkwardly.

JANETTE
We wanted to give you this.

She holds out an airport shopping bag.

EDDIE
Your duty free?

Terry pulls out the new ski helmet now customized with the
word “Eagle” on the front in gold.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
It’s a helmet.

JANETTE
A safety helmet.

Terry throws her a look: I’1l handle this.

TERRY
I put some Styrofoam inlay panels
at the key pressure points and a
few extra coats of shellac
polyurethane for general
reinforcement.

He hands the helmet to Eddie, pointing out his handiwork.

EDDIE
Good thinking.

JANETTE
You can’t be too careful.

Terry throws her another look: I said, I'll handle it.
TERRY
We just wanted to wish you luck.
That’s all.

Eddie runs a hand over the helmet.

EDDIE
Top quality finish, Dad.
97.

Janette can’t hide her fear any longer. She hugs Eddie so
tightly he can barely breathe.

JANETTE
Oh Eddie —

Terry glares furiously at his wife, betraying his own nerves
more than anything else.

TERRY
I thought we agreed to play it
cool!

EXT. CALGARY STADIUM - DAY
Fans STREAM into the stadium. Finally, it’s D-Day.

A row of global TV commentators — each one excitably
reporting in his native tongue. Apart from the lugubrious
fellow with a blonde beard. What a surprise. It’s Swedish TV.

RON PICKERING
That was Bruce "Blizzard" Sassoon,
the American, opening his account
with a distance of 109.5 meters.

INT. CALGARY CHANGING-ROOM - DAY

“Ahhhhhhhhh.” The applause of the crowd echoes from outside
as Eddie warms up, Peary massages his calfs.

PEARY
I want to hear you at the back of
the stands. If you’re not yelling
it, you're not selling it —

Waters drips on the floor. Peary is suddenly eye to eye with
a couple of naked Swedes. Whoa.

SWEDE
You are quite the popular fellow,
Eagle-Man. Every time we turn on
TV, you are there.

SWEDE #2
Maybe, perhaps, you could tell
us... What is the secret?
PEARY

Clothes.

A KLAXON sounds for the next jump.
98.

EXT. CALGARY STADIUM - DAY

Janette and Terry take their seats. Her knitted sweater says,
"I'm Eddie’s Mum."

INT. CALGARY CHANGING-ROOM - DAY
Peary gets Eddie to his feet.

PEARY
And remember: you’re going to land
so much harder on this jump. So
when your skis hit the slope keep
that fanny up. Whatever it takes,
don’t drop back otherwise...

A huge GASP goes up from the crowd.

The TV MONITOR shows a jump has gone horribly wrong — a
monster wipe-out on the slope.

PEARY (OS) (CONT’D)
Otherwise, you’re going to be
joining him.

OUT IN THE STANDS

Janette and Terry watch in horror as medics stretcher off the
injured jumper. It’s a broken limb at the least.

INT. TV GANTRY - DAY

CANUCK ANCHORMAN
And that may not be the only wipe-
out of the day. Not with Britain’s
Eddie “the Eagle” Edwards coming up
soon. Take a look at this.

They run footage of Peary arriving with Eddie earlier.

CANUCK ANCHORMAN (CONT’D)
Eddie’s coach is none other than
Bronson Peary, fallen whiz kid of
‘70s ski-jumping and an old Olympic
squad member of yours, if I’m not
mistaken, Warren?

WARREN SHARP
We had a few years together.
99.

SUPERIMPOSE: “Warren Sharp, Former US Olympics Coach.” A
Living Legend, no question. And not a man to waste words.

CANUCK ANCHORMAN
How do you feel about this
unconventional return?

Sharp flattens out his palms, not unprepared for the
question.

WARREN SHARP
There’s an old expression in
jumping. ‘You’re never bigger than
the hill.’ That was Bronson Peary
to a T. And it broke my heart. I
could never reach him. He was such
a natural talent when he was young.
Technique, flair — everything but
discipline and humility.

CANUCK ANCHORMAN
And now?

Sharp ponders the question deeply. Finally —
WARREN SHARP
He disrespected the sport so
totally as a jumper, I’m just sad
he’s going to do the same thing
today as a coach.

INT. CALGARY CHANGING-ROOM - DAY

The changing-room has fallen silent. Peary turns from the TV
monitor to find the whole room staring at him.

He doesn’t even attempt to make light of it. An Official
enters and points at him and Eddie. You. Next.

INT. CALGARY STADIUM - DAY

Eddie and Peary are ushered down the tunnel, two silhouettes
heading towards the rising wall of noise. One last glance at
each other before they step out into the light.

EXT. CALGARY STADIUM - DAY

Electric excitement pulses through the athletes and officials
‘backstage,’ including a British contingent.
100.
One by one, they start to recognize Eddie. So this is the
infamous Eagle.

Peary steers Eddie through the gauntlet of stares, feeling
the mounting pressure.

He gets to the check-in desk. Hands over their paperwork.
Mouth like cotton. They pass through to the elevator at the
base of the tower.

Eddie’s not sure what to do. So Peary leans over and presses
the button — just like a regular elevator.

EXT. CALGARY STADIUM - DAY

Down in the stands, Eddie’s parents feel the buzz in the
crowd. Officials hurry into position. TV crews from every
country get the countdown.

EXT. CALGARY 90M JUMP/ELEVATOR - DAY

As the elevator descends, Peary checks Eddie’s equipment for
the last time.

The doors open with a hiss. It’s all happening too fast.

Peary CLASPS Eddie’s arms. A complicated last look: fear,
affection, resolve. A coach's complete faith in his pupil.

PEARY
You know what to do.

He thumps Eddie’s chest, just like in their first lesson.

PEARY (CONT'D)
Linda Gray. All or nothing.

Eddie backs onto the elevator, joined by another athlete,
who’s just strolled up.

As the doors HISS shut —

PEARY (CONT'D)
See you at the bottom.

But the words are too late. All Peary can do now is step
backwards and tilt his head back to look up... And up... And
up...

It is truly a concrete monster of a jump.
101.

INT. CALGARY 90M JUMP/ELEVATOR - DAY

Inside, the roar of the crowd is eerily distant. Just the
rhythmic hum of the winching cables ascending into the sky.
Eddie stares ahead, trying to keep calm.

Suddenly -

MALE VOICE
Jumping is all that matters. If I
didn’t jump, I would drink and have
sex all the time.

Eddie turns and blinks. It is MATTI NYKANEN. His caravanette
poster made flesh.

Blonde, boyish and surprisingly small (5ft 8in), which throws
Eddie even more.

NYKANEN
Everything else is shit, no?

Eddie searches for a suitable reply.

EDDIE
«+. Congratulations on your medal.

NYKANEN
I win gold, but it was not my best.
If I had done my best, I could have
come last and been happier.

EDDIE
What, like me?

His strained laugh is quickly silenced.

NYKANEN
You did not do so good either.
EDDIE
No, not so good.
NYKANEN
You've done better.
EDDIE
(a chastised schoolboy)
Yes.
NYKANEN
You laugh. You think I am being
patronizing.

(MORE )
102.

NYKANEN (CONT'D)
(Eddie's not laughing at
all)
But you and I are like one o’clock
and eleven o’clock.

Nykanen extends two gloved fingers to demonstrate. A V-sign
over Eddie’s nose.

NYKANEN (CONT'D)
Closer to each other than to the
others. Winning, losing — that’s
for the little people.

He rotates his V-sign so a finger now points at each of them.

NYKANEN (CONT'D)
Men like us, we jump to free our
souls.

Eddie stares back, frankly bewildered. The doors HISS open.
Nykanen doesn’t move.

EDDIE
-+. I think this is our floor.

He still doesn’t get it. Nykanen leans in and grasps Eddie's
lapels.

NYKANEN
The only two jumpers with a chance
to make history today are you
and I.

His stare is rich with self-loathing and threat.

NYKANEN (CONT'D)

If we do less than our best with
the whole world watching, it will
kill us inside for all time.

And with that cheery parting thought, he steps out.

EXT. CALGARY 90M JUMP - DAY

Peary hurries down to his viewpoint, passing under the gaze
of his old coach in the TV gantry box.

RON PICKERING
Here he comes, the Flying Finn.
Matti Nykanen getting into position
to go for an unprecedented second
gold for jumping.
103.

Eddie is instructed to wait on the bench. But he can’t help
peering over as Nykanen sets off, hurtling down the jump. It
is a nigh perfect jump: 118.5m. Alpine poetry in motion.

The commentators are in raptures. The crowd applauds like
crazy. Eddie is momentarily relieved — it is like a blessing
— until he sees the close-up of Nykanen’s face on the
monitor, the tiny telling hint of disappointment.

Nykanen turns his piercing blue-eyed stare into the camera —
right into Eddie’s soul.

OFFICIAL
Edwards!

EXT. CALGARY 90M JUMP/START PLATFORM - DAY

Eddie moves onto the start platform. And now it all becomes
terrifyingly real. The horizon starts to sway. The sound of
SCRATCHING echoes in his head. His knees go weak and his
stomach heaves.

It’s just like the last time he was on the 90.
He spits into his steamed-up goggles, but nothing comes out.

The Official locks Eddie into position as he stares down the
monstrous ramp. No wind. No snow. No creaking metal. Just the
dying rumble of the crowd — the whole world — falling silent
as they wait for him to fail.

His pupils, his neighbors, the builders, the local kids — all
glued to their sets.

EXT. CALGARY 90M JUMP - DAY

Pickering drops his voice to a whisper as we pull back - and
back - and back - to see the full magnitude of Eddie’s task —
a 90m sheer drop, as high as a tower block.

RON PICKERING
The jump here at Calgary is a
doubly tricky one. The short
tabletop gives the jumpers less
time than normal to get aligned for
the push off. And the slope is a
steeper than average 38 degrees.

A ‘high-tech’ 80s graphic illustrates the steepness.
104.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
In short, it’s the fastest, most
unforgiving slope in the world,
especially when it comes to
landings. And if Edwards has one
weakness — one salient weakness, I
should say — it’s his landings.

EXT. CALGARY 90M JUMP/START PLATFORM - DAY

Eddie grips the rail, inching into position as the amber
light comes on.

RON PICKERING
Okay. Here we go...

But Eddie doesn’t move. At all.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
Don’t tell me he’s frozen up.

Actually, it’s worse. Eddie’s shuffling back.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
It’s going to have to be a re-set.
This is it for Edwards. Last and
final chance.

Eddie re-focuses, sweat beads on his forehead. The light
turns amber and then green, burning in front of him.

PEARY
Come on, you bugger, get moving.

Eddie pushes off, crouching low, picking up speed.

The wind pummels his cheeks as he hits 30 - 40 - 50mph. A
glorious, terrifying view spreading out below him...

He hurtles into the tabletop. Knees juddering over the ridged
ice. Going the fastest he’s ever skied in his life.

RON PICKERING
Here goes Edwards into the
straight. He’s got to pick his
moment just right -

Peary urges Eddie into his lift-off.

PEARY
Push. Up and out. Up and out.
105.

Eddie stretches for his life, straining into the wind, as his
skis shoot off the ramp edge.

RON PICKERING
He’s away, but it was late. That
was very late. That’s going to
cause all kinds of problems.
Janette and Terry hold each other tight in the crowd.

Eddie’s ski-tips swing up to his face — dangerously close.
He’s leaning forward. Way forward.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
Oh no. He’s going to lose his
balance.

His pupils go wide-eyed. Janette turns away, unable to look.

EXT. CALGARY STADIUM - DAY

Eddie grits his teeth as he reaches the pinnacle of his
flight. Still no sound coming from his mouth.

RON PICKERING
How he’s going to make this
landing, I don’t know.

PEARY
Release!

But Eddie’s still not yelling anything as -

He flaps his arms desperately — still no sound coming from
his mouth — as he starts to fall -

Target's cold eyes burning into his brain...

PEARY (CONT'D)
Come on, release!

Peary thumps his chest.

RON PICKERING
He’s coming in too steeply, surely.

The slope rushing upwards beneath his shuddering ski tips...

As Eddie sees Wilma Rudolph smash through the finish tape and
he finally summons up his voice and lets rip —

EDDIE
Abhhhhhhhhhhhhhbhh...
106.

Drowning out every rejection, every setback.

PEARY
Abhhhhhhhhhhhhhhbhhh!!!

BUILDERS /PUPILS/KIDS
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

EDDIE
Abhhhhhhhhhhhhhhbhhh!!!

His skis SLAM into the snow, his whole body ROCKED with the
impact... Just like jumping milk crates on his bicycle.

RON PICKERING
Oh no!

Janette and Terry wince. The crowd gasps. Eddie’s butt has
dropped, his arms are flailing, but he’s still screaming...

EDDIE
Abhhhhhhhhhhhhh! !!

Target starts to smile with vindication... Some of the
commentators too.

But Peary refuses to concede defeat.

PEARY
Up! Up!

Eddie gives one final agonizing push and with all his might,
lifts his body back upwards to crest the safety bump and
shoot his arms into the air.
It’s good. He’s safe. He’s made it.
PEARY (CONT'D)
(leaping the barrier)
Ahhhhhhh, you motherf-----

RON PICKERING
Unbelievable! Unbelievable.

Janette and Terry whoop and holler, sending their neighbors’
popcorn flying.
EXT. CALGARY 90M JUMP/SLOPE - DAY

Peary rushes to Eddie as he skis to a stop. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
It’s a two-man primal meltdown.
107.

RON PICKERING
I've been waiting nearly two weeks
to say this. Well, here goes — The
Eagle has Landed!

The crowd ROAR and CHEER, loving every second as Peary and
Eddie hug and topple over into the snow.

Everyone’s letting rip. The Swedish coach EVEN gives a curt
nod to Lars. Not bad.

The only person conspicuously not watching this is Target.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
Britain’s Eddie Edwards has
completed his large hill jump — and
it’s a belter. A small jump for
mankind, a very small jump, but
it’s a personal best in competition
for Edwards — 71.5 meters. And that
is a new British Record.

Peary and Eddie get control of themselves until they see the
result flash up: “71.5m... A new UK record.”

Peary turns to catch Warren Sharp’s reaction, up in the
commentary box. But Sharp is already removing his headphones
and leaving...

Peary’s disappointment is swept aside by Eddie hugging him
all over again, falling onto the snow.

RON PICKERING (CONT’D)
What a sight. What an amazing
sight.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Eddie and Peary tumble into the dressing room. Eddie goes
straight for the Jaffa Cakes only to notice the muted
watchful glances from the other athletes... Alerting them to
the august presence waiting by their locker.

Warren Sharp, as they live and breathe. His aura is even more
impressive in the flesh, almost religious in effect.

His eyes meet Peary’s. The forbidding father and the outcast
son. A electrically charged reunion 20 years in the making.

Sharp slowly reaches into Peary's bag. Eddie stiffens.... But
instead of a flask, Sharp pulls out Peary’s copy of Sharp
Words. Notices the many comments scrawled in the margins.
108.

WARREN SHARP
Interesting read?

Peary manages a nod.

PEARY
Very...

He’s actually lost for words.

WARREN SHARP
Instructive?

Sharp pulls out a thick Mont Blanc pen. Inscribes the title
page. The room is so quiet, everyone can hear the pen
scratching.

He finishes and hands Peary the book, considering his former
athlete, and the man he’s become.

WARREN SHARP (CONT'D)
I was wrong about you today.

No more words are needed. The atonement is complete. He gives
Peary’s shoulder a paternal squeeze, pent-up emotion flooding
across Peary’s face.

The soothing hum of a plane fades up, taking them home -

INT. PLANE - NIGHT

Eddie and Peary in steerage, utterly drained, utterly
content, enjoying it all — drinks, snacks, headphones and a
copy of the Calgary Herald.

EDDIE
“The most raucous applause came
during Olympic President Juan
Antonio Samaranch’s speech at the
closing ceremony when he said,
“Some competitors have won gold and
some have broken records, and one
has even flown like an eagle...”

Peary digs out his copy of Sharp Words and flips to the
title page.

PEARY
I think I can match that.

He shows Eddie the handwritten inscription.
109.

EDDIE
“Now the real works begins - W.S.”

Peary picks up his glass of bubbly.

PEARY
So how about it? To the next four
years?

Eddie picks up his glass of milk.

EDDIE
At the least.

They clink and drink, not noticing the ominous blur of green
making its way towards them from first class.

VOICE
They have hangers, you know.

It's Target. He moves aside Eddie’s folded-up blazer up on
the empty seat. Sits down on the arm.

TARGET
It’s only fair to tell you. A
motion has already been approved to
amend the entry criteria for the
next Olympics.

He pauses to savor the killer blow.

TARGET (CONT'D)
You will never be wearing this
blazer again.

He shifts closer, free at last to say what he really thinks.

TARGET (CONT'D)
You think because a few TV pundits
find your antics amusing, you've
done something to be proud of. But
you came last — twice. You made
fools of your countrymen. You
embarrassed your flag. When you get
home, you're going to find out how
funny that really is.

INT. HEATHROW TERMINAL 4 - DAY

An endless terminal corridor, down which Eddie pushes his
baggage cart, Peary alongside, the blazer resting on his bag.
110.

It is a desolate place. Jetlagged passengers shuffling like
zombies. Except the odd one who whispers and points at Eddie.

Up ahead at Customs, Target is surrounded by his gleaming
downhill boys. All spruced up in their blazers. They point
out Eddie to some CUSTOMS OFFICIALS.

PEARY
My connection’s Terminal 3.

EDDIE
Time for a coffee then.

Before Eddie can follow Peary, the Officers approach him.

CUSTOMS OFFICER
This way, sir.

Eddie is taken to one side while Target and his chinless
wonders are escorted through.

EDDIE
What’s the matter?

CUSTOMS OFFICER
If you just come with me, we can
explain it all.
Peary is told to keep moving. “Nothing to see here.”
Another OFFICIAL arrives to take Eddie’s bag and skis. Leads
him into a sideroom — Eddie, a German Shepherd and two

customs officials alone in a tiny room.

EDDIE
It’s not a drugs test is it?

The Officers share a wry glance, which is really unnerving.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
‘Cos I can tell you now, I’ve never
taken a steroid in my life -
A far door opens and a forbidding SENIOR OFFICIAL enters.
SENIOR CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
This is him is it? Righty-o. Let’s
get this moving.

He gestures firmly for Eddie to follow him.

SENIOR CUSTOMS OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
This way, sir.
111.

Eddie, his nerves already at breaking point, is steered
forward through the second door and his jaw hits the floor.

INT. HEATHROW ARRIVALS - DAY

A thousand people are waiting for him. Crammed in with
banners, flags, foam fingers, stetsons. There’s women in
bikinis from a vodka company, TV cameras, his local Mayor.

His whole life before his eyes: his parents, Julie, the
neighbors, the builders. All there for him.

This isn’t the polite amusement of the Calgary crowd. This is
a full-on folk hero explosion. The great stonewashed. Not the
prettiest bunch in the world, but the most adoring.

EDDIE
Bloody ada.

Janette gives him the proudest hug of her life, tearing up,
as well-wishers gather round and flashbulbs explode.

TERRY
Alright, alright, calm down.

Terry takes his turn to hug Eddie only to tear up even more.

TERRY (CONT'D)
Now look what you made me do.

EDDIE
(dabbing his own eyes now)
Me? You started it.

Everywhere he looks — delirious faces wearing pink Eddie-
style glasses. Hanging over balconies, clambering onto check-
in counters. Even some policemen are craning their necks for
a better look.

Some of the British athletes are there too, swept along by
chaotic energy of the crowd. Giving it up. One team-mate to
another.

Eddie catches Target’s face, tight-lipped with rage, as his
Aide and the downhill squad mutinously join in clapping.

An equally amazed Peary joins the fold as one of the Tabloid
Reporters sticks a microphone under Target’s nose.
112.

BLUFF JOURNALIST
Mr. Target! The one British athlete
being acclaimed as a hero is the
very person you didn’t want to
compete. Any comment?

TARGET
Piss off.

Eddie and Peary turn from this clinching irony to face each
other and the emotion is overwhelming — relief, joy,
vindication...

The crowd hoists Eddie onto its shoulders, lifting him into
full view. The effect is like a winning goal. He can’t decide
whether to smile or cry. So he does both, waving and waving.

For Eddie, finally, the dream has come true. He gives the V-
for-victory sign — the reverse of what he’s been giving since
he was a kid — as we freeze-frame and immortalize what has
just turned into the greatest day of his life.

SUPERIMPOSE: “Eddie continued to jump in European
contests and eventually retired with a
personal best of 115m — a new British
record.”

THE END
