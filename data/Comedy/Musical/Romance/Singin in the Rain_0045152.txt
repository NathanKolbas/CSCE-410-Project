SINGING IN TIE RAIN.

FADE Iil: : oy
EGYPTIAN THEATER --HOLLYVOOD - EXT. NIGHT 1-10

The scene is Hollywood in 1927, at the peak of
the silent movie era just prior to the intro-
duction of sound pictures. It is the night

of a big premiere. First we see huge beams

of light searching the sky from big search-
lights placed around the theater. ‘We see a
street sign saying "Hollywood Boulevard"

wnich is alternately lit up and dark as the
Dean hits it. We see the front of the Egyptian
Theater and. enormous crowds along the boulevard
and from the clothes of the people we see that
we are in the late '20'ts.

The marques reads "Fremiere Tonight a
Biggest Picture of 1927"

A couple of kids have climbed a palm tree and
a>e looking at a sign reading:

"Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont in 'The Royal
Rascalt," :

The police are holding back surging crotds
which are pressing against ropes forming an
aisle from the street to the entrance to the
theater, The aisle is covered. with red car-
peting.-

A kid is clutching a fan magazine on the

cover of which we see a nicture of two movie
stars and the heading "Loclwood and Lanont -
Reel Life or Rewal Life Romance?" About
three-quarters of the war up the aisle to the
theater is a large, old-fashioned microphone,
and to either side high poles topped with the
flaring horns of an early public address systen.
At the microphone stands Dora Bailey, a smartly
dressed, matronly woman, a leading filn colum-
ist, who is addressing the crowd.

 

Dora (highly excited; in an

over ecstatic gushy voice)
This is Dora Bailsy, ladies and gentlemen -- .
talking to you from the front of the Egyptian Theater
in Hollywood, What a night, ladies and gentlemen --
what a night! Every star in Hollywood's heaven is
here to make Monumental Pictures’ premiere of "The
Royal Rascal" the outstanding event of 1927, Every-
one is breathlessly awaiting the arrival of Lina
Lamont and Don Loclnood, and --

A shriek goes up from the crowd as a
limousine puils up.

Lina leugh end wave as they walk up the
aisle. Don is a dashing handsome, athletic-
looking young fellow with a:natural air of
jeuntiness and high spirits, bearing a
strong rememblance to Gene Kelly. Line:‘is
the epitome of classic patrician heauty,
regal, elegent ad slightly eloof, a vision
of devastating loveliness. They stop at
the microphone and are greeted effusively
by Dora. 2. .

Lina bows graciously to the crowd. Don

playing at a bit of & disadventage, inter-
twined emong many clotheslines on which are.
henging shirts end long underweer, A cat
crawling along the fence beside them
bristles in sheer terror at the sound and
dashes avay., We see something drop at their
feet, obviously @ coin'wrapped in a bit of
newspaper, Encouraged, they play even more
violently, looking up with happy expressions
in the direction of their unscen patrons.
Suddenly they are showered from head to foot
with ea huge cascade of water,
