X-Files

North Texas 35,000 BC 

(Two heavily bundled men are shown running through a snowstorm. 
In a cave, they find their lost comrade, and an alien finds them. 
The one man is killed by the alien and while the other one defends 
himself by stabbing the alien, he is infected with the black oil. 
Cut to...)


North Texas Present Day

(STEVIE falls through a weak spot in the ground and his three friends 
look down upon him.)

KID 1
Stevie, you ok? 

STEVIE
I got... I got... [Coughs] I got the wind knocked out of me. 

[STEVIE looks around and then wanders deeper into the cavern.] 

KID 1
Stevie? 

STEVIE
It's a human skull! 

KID 2
Toss it up here, dude! 

STEVIE
No way butt-munch, this is mine. [pauses] 
Anyway, there's bones all over the place. 

[STEVIE looks at the skull, then, looking down, he sees that there 
is a puddle of black oil under his right shoe.] 

STEVIE
What the...? 

KID 1
Stevie? 

[The black oil begins to overtake him, crawling under his skin until 
they meet and cloud his eyes.]

KID 2
Hey man, let's get out of here. 

[The boys run away from the hole. The camera pans back to show 
that the scene is happening in a suburban area outside a large town.
Fade to later the same day. Fire trucks pull up to the scene.]

FIRE CHIEF
[looking down hole] We're going to need a fourteen footer. 

[A ladder slams down onto the bottom of the hole.] 

FIRE CHIEF
This is [static], I'll be acting as the old town HC. 
Ok, in the hole, two down. 

[Two men climb down into the hole and crouch by STEVIE, who 
is lying down in the dirt in the cavern.]

FIRE CHIEF [talking to radio] TC, you see the boy? 
Talk to me . Jerry, check TC's radio. In the hole. 

[Black helicopter flies in and lands at the scene. 
A man, BRONSCHWEIG, exits the chopper.]

BRONSCHWEIG [to FIRE CHIEF] Get these people out of here. 

[Four men in biohazard suits exit the helicopter, and carry a 
person-sized container towards the hole.]

FIRE CHIEF
Initial reports said that the boy's eyes had turned black, 
then I lost contact with my men. 

[The men in suits carry the container, which now has the boy in it, 
to the helicopter] 

FIRE CHIEF
What about my men? 

[The helicopter takes off.] 

FIRE CHIEF
What about my men?? 

[Several tanker trucks and semi-trucks pull up to the scene.] 

FIRE CHIEF
What the...? 

[BRONSCHWEIG watches, and then walks behind one of the trucks 
where no one else can hear. He dials a number on his cell phone.]

BRONSCHWEIG [in phone] It's Bronschweig. Sir, the unthinkable 
situation that we never planned for? Well, we better come up with a plan. 



Federal Building, Dallas Texas 

[Scene begins with FBI agents on the Federal Building roof with dogs 
and helicoptors. Darius MICHAUD is directing the activities....] 

MICHAUD
Found anything yet? 

MAN
No sir. 

MICHAUD
Did you send the dogs through? 

MAN
Yes, but we didn't find anything. 

MICHAUD
Then send them through again. 

MAN
[to other FBI agents] All right everyone, we're doing it again. 

[MICHAUD looks at a building across the street where a lone person 
is walking on the roof.....Cut to the other building where we see 
SCULLY on her cell phone...]

SCULLY
Mulder, it's me. 

MULDER
Where are you, Scully? 

SCULLY
I'm on the roof. 

MULDER
Did you find anything? 

SCULLY
No I haven't. 

MULDER
What's wrong? 

SCULLY
Well, I just climbed up 12 floors, I'm hot, I'm thirsty and to 
be honest, I'm wondering what I'm doing up here. 

MULDER
You're looking for a bomb. 

SCULLY
Yes, I know that, but the threat was called in to the 
Federal building across the street. 

MULDER
I think they have that covered. 

SCULLY
Mulder, when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the 
rational purpose of providing that information is to allow us to find 
the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. 
If you'd study the statistics, you'd find the model behavioral pattern 
for virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive 
device; and if we don't act in accordance with that data, if you ignore
it as we have done, the chances are great that if there actually is a 
bomb, we might not find it. Lives could be lost .... Mulder. Mulder? 

(he pops up behind her)

MULDER
Boom. 

SCULLY
Jesus, Mulder! 

MULDER
Whatever happened to playing a hunch, Scully? 

SCULLY
I know you're bored in this assignment, Mulder, but 
unconventional thinking is only going to get you in trouble now. 

MULDER
What makes you think I'm bored? 

SCULLY
You've gotta quit looking for what isn't there. They've
closed the X-files. There's procedure to be followed now ... protocol. 

MULDER
Maybe we should call in a bomb threat to Houston. 
I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome. 

[SCULLY attempts to open the door] 

SCULLY
Now what? 

MULDER
It's locked? 

SCULLY So much for anticipating the unforeseen. [Mulder tries to 
open the door and it opens easily, Scully smiles.] ... I had you. 

MULDER
No, you didn't. 

SCULLY
Oh, yeah. I had you big time. 

MULDER
You had nothing. Come on, I saw you jiggle the handle. 

[Exiting stairwell/elevator at bottom floor past a group of children, 
one of which says "FBI."] 

SCULLY
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a definite moment of panic. 

MULDER
You've never seen me panic. That's not the face I make when 
I panic. This is the face I make when I panic.

[Mulder's face registers no emotion.]

SCULLY
That's the face I saw. 

MULDER
You never saw that face. 

SCULLY
Yes I did, that was the face. You're buyin'. 

MULDER
Coke, Pepsi, saline IV? 

SCULLY
Something sweet.

[MULDER heads down to a room containing the vending machines,
passing a man on his way out. He doesn't see the man double-back
and weld the door shut behind MULDER. He puts money in the 
machine and nothing comes out. He shakes the machine, then 
looks behind it and notices that the machine is unplugged. He calls 
SCULLY on her cell phone (555-0113). Cut to the lobby, where 
SCULLY is standing.] 

SCULLY
[answering her phone] Scully. 

MULDER
Scully, I found the bomb. 

SCULLY You're funny, Mulder. Where are you? 

MULDER
I'm locked in the vending room. 

[MULDER pounds on the door.]

SCULLY
Is that you pounding? 

MULDER
Yes, you need to get someone in here. 

[SCULLY reaches for the doorknob, but it doesn't turn. It's locked.]

SCULLY
All right, Mulder. 

[The camera pans to show that the machine is now open and filled with 
explosives. A timer is ticking down.] 

MULDER
Look, you've got about fourteen minutes to evacuate this 
building. 

[Cut back to SCULLY outside of the vending room. SCULLY looks
down at her watch.] 

SCULLY
Mulder ... 

MULDER
Thirteen fifty-four. Thirteen fifty-two. Thirteen fifty.
You see a pattern emerging here, Scully? 

[SCULLY looks down and realizes that the key hole has been welded 
shut.] 

SCULLY
Hang on, Mulder, I'm going to get you out of there. 

[SCULLY goes back to the lobby and gives orders to the security 
guard....] 

SCULLY
I need this building evacuated and cleared out in 10 minutes. 
I need you to get on the phone and tell the fire department to block off 
the city center in a one mile radius around the building. DON'T THINK! 
JUST PICK UP THE PHONE AND MAKE IT HAPPEN! [on the phone...] 
This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I need to speak to SAC Michaud, 
he's got the wrong building! 

[Vehicles of all assortments pull up to the building. MICHAUD exits 
a car and begins to hastily walk with SCULLY into the building.] 

MICHAUD
Where is it? 

SCULLY
In the vending room. Agent Mulder is locked in with it. 

[Cut to MULDER staring at the bomb, making an emotionless expression. 
SCULLY calls MULDER and he jumps when he hears the phone ring. 
He answers the phone.] 

MULDER
You know that face I showed you... I'm making it again. 

SCULLY
Mulder, get away from the door. We're coming in. 

[SCULLY and bomb team cut through the door with a torch.] 

MULDER
[to Michaud] Tell me that that's just soda pop in those 
canisters. 

MICHAUD
[looking at bomb] It's just what it looks like. A big I.E.D. 
[pauses] Okay, everyone else clear the building. 

[Everyone leaves the room except MICHAUD, MULDER, and SCULLY.] 

MULDER
Can you disarm it? 

MICHAUD
Yes I can. 

MULDER
We've got less than four minutes to see if you're right. 

MICHAUD
[irritated] Did you hear me? I gave you a direct order. 
[MULDER nods] Now get out of here! 

SCULLY
Come on, Mulder. 

[Cut to MULDER and SCULLY running out of the building. 
MULDER slows and looks back.] 

MULDER
Something's wrong. 

[SCULLY grabs MULDER.] 

SCULLY
Mulder ... 

MULDER
Something's not right. 

SCULLY
There's no time!! 

[They get into the waiting police car. Shot of inside the building with 
MICHAUD sitting waiting for the bomb to go off--not attempting to stop 
it. The building explodes. MULDER and SCULLY get out of the car 
and look at the damage.]

MULDER
Next time, you're buying. 



Washington DC, Office of Professional Review 

[After the bombing, MULDER and SCULLY are called in for questioning 
by an FBI review panel headed by Assitant D.A. Jana Cassidy. MULDER 
arrives late to the review. Upon his entrance, MULDER and SCULLY 
learn that five bodies were found in the federal building. A boy's, three 
firemen, and SAC MICHAUD. Insisting that the building was empty with 
the exception of MICHAUD, MULDER is forced to wait outside while
SCULLY presents her narrative. While MULDER waits, Skinner alerts
him to what is really going on. * indicates that the line is from the 
novelization of the movie, and may differ from the movie itself.]

CASSIDY
Due to the events at Waco and Ruby Ridge, there is a 
heightened need at the Attorney General's office to place responsibility 
as early as possible for the catastrophic destruction of public property 
and loss of life due to terrorist activities. Many details are still unclear, 
but we're under some pressure from the Attorney General to give an 
accurate picture of what happened so that she can issue a public 
statement. We know now that five people died, in the explosion. 
Special ...

(MULDER enters, late.)

CASSIDY
.. Special Agent In Charge Darius Michaud, who was trying 
to defuse the bomb that was hidden in a vending machine, three 
firemen from Dallas and a young boy. Now, I'd like to begin this 
interview ...

MULDER
Excuse me--the firemen and the young boy, they were 
found in the building?

CASSIDY
Agent Mulder, since you weren't able to be on time for this 
hearing, I'd like you to step outside so that we can hear Agent Scully's 
version of the facts so that she will not be paid the same disrespect.

MULDER
We had been told the building was clear... 

CASSIDY
You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder. Please step outside. 

(MULDER leaves the hearing, and SKINNER joins him in the hallway.)

SKINNER
You don't see what's going on, do you? There's forty 
million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. 
So the story being shaped is that this could have been prevented.

MULDER
They want to blame us.

SKINNER
Agent Mulder, you and I both know that if it looks bad, 
it's bad for the FBI. Blame has to be assigned somewhere

MULDER
If they want to blame someone they can blame me, 
Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.

SKINNER
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.

MULDER
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the SAC.
I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.

SKINNER
Agent Scully says that it was she who ordered you out 
of the building, that you wanted to go back...

MULDER
No.

[SCULLY enters, having been excused from her hearing.]

SCULLY
They're asking for you, sir.

[SKINNER leaves and goes into the hearing room.]

MULDER
Whatever you told them in there, Scully, you don't have 
to protect me.

SCULLY
All I told them was the truth

MULDER
They're trying to divide us on this and we can't let them.

SCULLY
Mulder, they have divided us. They're splitting us up.

MULDER
But they're the ones who put us together.

SCULLY
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work into the 
paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that...

MULDER
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.

SCULLY
They're not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in 
medicine because I thought I could make a difference at the FBI. 
But it hasn't turned out that way. And now if I were transferred to 
Omaha or Witchita, or some other field office - it just doesn't hold 
the interest for me that it once did. Not after what I've seen.

MULDER
(in total amused disbelief) You're quitting.

SCULLY
There's really no reason for me to stay anymore...
Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.

[Skinner returns to summon MULDER for his hearing, and as MULDER 
turns to leave SCULLY, she apologizes, and turns to find that he had 
walked off without his jacket. She calls to him and he walks back to 
her for the jacket with hurt and pain in his face.]

SKINNER
Agent Mulder, you're up. 

[MULDER begins to walk back to the boardroom.] 

SCULLY
Mulder. 

[SCULLY hands MULDER his coat, which he nearly forgot on the chair.]

SCULLY
Good luck. 

[MULDER enters the room, and the camera shows SCULLY walk out 
of the FBI building.] 



Casey's Bar, Southeast Washington, DC 

BARTENDER
I'd say this just about exceeds your minimum daily 
requirement. 

[MULDER drinks the entire glassful, and upon setting it down he nearly 
knocks over glasses but tries to catch them.]

BARTENDER
Whoa, easy there. Gotta train for this kind of heavy lifting. 
Rough day?  [MULDER puts his finger to the bar as a sign that he wants 
another. MULDER looks over his shoulder and notices a man at the bar 
watching him]  So what is it that you do? 

MULDER
What do I do? 

BARTENDER
Mmm Hmm. 

MULDER
I'm the key figure in an on-going government charade, 
the plot to conceal the truth about the existence of extraterrestrials. 
It's a global conspiracy, actually, with key players in the highest 
levels of power, that reaches down into the lives of every man,
woman, and child on this planet, so, of course, no one believes me. 
I'm an annoyance to my superiors, a joke to my peers. They call me 
Spooky. Spooky Mulder, whose sister was abducted by aliens when 
he was just a kid and who now chases after little green men with a 
badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens or to anyone who will listen 
that the fix is in, that the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be 
the shit-storm of all time. 

BARTENDER
Well. I would say that about does it, Spooky.
[takes drinks away from MULDER] 

MULDER
Does what? 

BARTENDER
Looks like eighty-six is your lucky number. 

[MULDER takes money out of his wallet.] 

MULDER
You know, one is the loneliest number. 

[MULDER looks over his shoulder again and sees the man is no longer 
at the bar. He then gets up, wavers a bit, then walks to the men's room 
which he finds is out of order. He knocks on the women's door and it's 
occupied. He goes out the exit into the alley and relieves himself (on a 
poster of Independence Day). The man from the bar, Dr. Kurtzweil, walks 
outside.] 

KURTZWEIL
That official FBI business? 

MULDER
What? 

KURTZWEIL
Bet the Bureau's accusing you of doing the same thing 
in Dallas. 

MULDER
How's that? 

KURTZWEIL
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are 
exploding. 

MULDER
[annoyed] Do I know you? 

KURTZWEIL
No, but I've been watching your career for a long time, 
ever since you were just a promising young agent. 

MULDER
You come out here for a reason? 

KURTZWEIL
Yeah. 

[Kurtzweil steps up to the wall and unzips pants, and begins to 
relieve himself. MULDER begins to walk inside.] 

KURTZWEIL
I'm a doctor, an old friend of your father's. 

[MULDER turns back around to look at Kurtzweil.] 

KURTZWEIL
We were in the war together, but his disenchantment 
outlasted mine. 

MULDER
You a reporter? 

KURTZWEIL
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN. 

MULDER
You've got as much time to talk to me as it takes to 
hail a cab. 


[MULDER and Kurtzweil are outside now, MULDER is raising his 
hand to hail a cab.] 

KURTZWEIL
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building?
Why not the federal building? 

MULDER
The federal building was too well guarded. 

KURTZWEIL
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street 
because it did have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there, which is where 
the bodies where found. But that's the thing ... the thing you didn't know. 
The thing you'd never think to check. [pause] Those people were already 
dead. 

MULDER
Before the bomb went off? 

KURTZWEIL
That's what I'm saying. 

[A cab pulls up.] 

MULDER
I think you're full of shit. 

KURTZWEIL
Do you now? 

[MULDER enters the cab and closes the door.] 

MULDER
Arlington, please. 

MULDER
On second thought, lets go to Georgetown. 
Let's go to Georgetown... 


SCULLY's Apartment, Georgetown 

[A shot of SCULLY laying awake in her bed, when pounding begins
on her door. She answers the door to face her partner.]

MULDER
Sorry I woke you ... Did I wake you? 

SCULLY
No. 

MULDER
Why not? It's three o'clock in the morning... 

SCULLY
Are you drunk, Mulder? 

MULDER
I ... I ... I was until about 20 minutes ago, yeah.

SCULLY
Was that before or after you decided to come here?

MULDER
What exactly are you implying? 

SCULLY
Go home, Mulder. 

MULDER
No, get dressed. 

SCULLY
Mulder ... 

MULDER
I'll explain on the way. Just get dressed. 



North Texas (Blackwood) 

[The camera shows a large tent over the area of the hole, and guards 
patrol the area. A helicopter flies in and Cigarette Smoking Man
(CSM) exits the helicopter after it lands. Cut to the actual entrance 
of the cave. A man in a white biohazard suit climbs up the ladder 
and another scientist helps him remove his headgear, revealing that 
it is BRONSCHWEIG. BRONSCHWEIG looks over and sees that 
CSM is in the tent. CSM approaches.] 

CSM
You got something to show me? 

[Cut to in the cavern. CSM is now in a bio-hazard suit and is 
following BRONSCHWEIG.] 

BRONSCHWEIG
We've cooled the temperature back down to sub-zero, 
in order to slow the development, which is like nothing we've ever seen. 

CSM
Brought on by? 

BRONSCHWEIG
Heat, I think. The subincurrent invasion of a host, 
the fireman, in a climate that raised his temperature above ninety-eight 
point six. 

[BRONSCHWEIG pulls back a curtain in the temperature regulated 
room, showing a man who is covered in goo and is barely alive.
Something else is moving and growing inside him.] 

CSM
This man is still alive. 

BRONSCHWEIG
Physically, and biologically. [pauses] But he'll 
never recover ... Should we destroy it like the others? 

CSM
No, no. We have to try our vaccine on it. 

BRONSCHWEIG
And if it's unsuccessful? 

CSM
Burn it, like the others. 



Montgomery County Maryland - the morgue 

[Having convinced SCULLY to once again join him on his search for 
the truth, MULDER brings her to autopsy the bodies of the firefighters 
from the Dallas explosion.]

CLERK
ID and floor you're visiting.

MULDER
We're going down to the morgue.

CLERK
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than 
authorized medical personel. 

MULDER
On whose orders? 

CLERK
General McAddie's

MULDER
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We 
were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.

CLERK
I don't know anything about that.

MULDER
Well, call General McAddie.

CLERK
I don't have his number.

MULDER
They can patch you through the switchboard. You don't 
know the switchboard number?

CLERK
I'm calling my C.O.

MULDER
Listen, son. We don't have time to dick around here, 
watching you demonstrate your ignorance of the chain of command. 
The order came from General McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct 
our business while you confirm authorization.

CLERK
Why don't you go ahead down and I'll confirm autorization.

MULDER
Thank you. [he walks off with SCULLY]  Why is a morgue 
suddenly off limits on orders of a general?

[they arrive in one of the rooms, where a man's body lies on a gurney]

SCULLY
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?

MULDER
According to the toe tag.

SCULLY
And you're looking for?

MULDER
Cause of death

SCULLY
I can tell you without even looking at him. Concussive 
organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris. 
This body has already been autopsied, Mulder. You can tell from 
the way it's been wrapped and dressed.

[Mulder pulls back the covering sheet.]

MULDER
Does this fit the description you just read me, Scully?

SCULLY
Oh my God. This man's tissue-

MULDER
It's like jelly.

SCULLY
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely 
edematous. Mulder, there's been no autopsy preformed. There's no 
Y-incision, no internal exam.

MULDER
So you're telling me that the information on that autopsy 
report is false? That this man didn't die of exposure and flying debris? 

SCULLY
I can't tell you what killed this man, and I'm not sure 
anyone else could either. 

[MULDER and SCULLY wheel the body into the lab.]

SCULLY
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we 
got here. You're saying that this is a coverup? Of what?

MULDER
I don't know, but I have a hunch that what you're going to 
find here won't be easily categorized or referenced. 

SCULLY
Mulder, this is going to take some time. Sooner or later, 
they're going to realize that we're not even supposed to be here. 

MULDER
We are being blamed for this man's death, I would like to 
know what he died of, wouldn't you? 

[MULDER leaves her to attend to the autopsy and goes to find
Kurtzweil.]


MULDER
(to cab driver)
Here. I think this is it. 

[Cut to a shot of MULDER entering Kurtzweil's apartment. MULDER 
begins to look around, flipping through some magazines on a table.
A detective enters the room.]

DETECTIVE
Excuse me. May I help you? 

MULDER
I was looking for Dr. Kurtzweil. 

DETECTIVE
You have some sort of business with him? 

[MULDER flashes his badge]

ANOTHER DETECTIVE
The feds are after him too. 

DETECTIVE
Nice business he has, eh? 

MULDER
What's that? 

DETECTIVE
Selling naked pictures of little kids on his computer.
[pauses] That is what you're looking for him for? 

[MULDER picks up some books from the bookshelf. One of the titles 
is "Countdown to the Apocalypse", and both are written by Kurtzweil.]

MULDER
No... [pause] I had an appointment for a pelvic exam... 

DETECTIVE
Hey, you want we should give you a call if he turns up? 

MULDER
No, don't bother. 


[MULDER exits the building, and sees Kurtzweil in the alley. He 
motions to MULDER to come closer. MULDER enters the alley.]

KURTZWEIL
See this crap? Someone knows I'm talking to you. 

MULDER
(sarcastically)
Not according to the men in blue. 

KURTZWEIL
Well, what is it this time? Kiddy porn again? 
Sexual battery of a patient? 

MULDER
They want to discredit you, for what? 

KURTZWEIL
Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too 
much about the truth.

MULDER
Oh, that end-of-the-world apocalyptic garbage you write? 

KURTZWEIL
You know my work?  [he smiles hopefully, but 
MULDER just sighs.]  I was right about Dallas, wasn't I? 

MULDER
How? How were you right? 

KURTZWEIL
Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder? 

MULDER
Yeah, It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the 
southwestern United States several years ago. 

KURTZWEIL
According to the newspaper, FEMA was called out to
manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you aware of what the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA 
allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon 
declaration of a national emergency. Think about that!  What is an 
agency with such broad-sweeping power doing managing a small 
viral outbreak in suburban Texas?

MULDER
You're saying it wasn't such a small outbreak.

KURTZWEIL
No, I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus. 

[Another police car pulls up to the front of the building. 
MULDER and Kurtzweil walk farther into the alleyway.]

KURTZWEIL
When your father and I were in the service, we were 
recruited for a project. It was biological warfare. 

MULDER
What killed those men? 

KURTZWEIL
What killed those men I won't even write about. We have 
no context for what killed those men, and no appreciation for how it will 
be unleashed in the future. The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. 
A silent weapon for a quiet war. The sytematic release of an 
indiscriminant organism for which the men who bring it on still have no 
cure! They've been working on this for fifty years!  While the rest of the 
world have been fighting gooks and commies, these men have been 
secretly negotiating a planned armageddon!

MULDER
Negotiating with whom?

KURTZWEIL
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will 
happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. 
The president will declare a state of emergency, at which time all 
federal agencies, all governemnt will come under the power of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder, 
the secret government.

MULDER
And they tell me I'm paranoid. 

KURTZWEIL
Go back to Dallas, Agent Mulder, and dig. Or we'll find
out with the rest of the country, when it's too late. 


[Meanwhile, back at the morgue, SCULLY'S hiding under one of the
gurneys as the guards are looking for her.]

MULDER
(over phone) Scully, it's me... 

SCULLY
(whispering)
Yeah. 

MULDER
Why are you whispering? 

SCULLY
(whispering)
I can't really talk right now, Mulder. 

MULDER
Scully, listen to me. I'm going home, then I am booking a 
flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket too. 

SCULLY
(whispering)
Mulder, I have a hearing tomorrow... 

MULDER
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. 

SCULLY
(whispering) Mulder, I'm way past the point of common 
sense here. 

MULDER
This has nothing to do with common sense. Scully? 
[she has hung up on him]


Dallas, Texas 11:21 AM FBI Field Office 

FIELD AGENT
You're looking for what amounts to a needle in a 
haystack. I'm afraid the explosion was so devastating that there
hasn't been a whole lot we've been able to put together just yet. 

MULDER
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe 
something from the FEMA offices where the bodies where found. 

FIELD AGENT
We weren't expecting to find those remains of course. 
They went right off to Washington. 

MULDER
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.? 

FIELD AGENT
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning.
We thought we had another casualty but it turns out FEMA got them 
from an archeological site. 

MULDER
Have you examined them? 

FIELD AGENT
No. Just fossils, as far as we know. 

[SCULLY enters the room and MULDER notices her. Without motioning 
to her, he turns to the field agent and indicates SCULLY.... ]

MULDER
I'd like this person to take a look, if you don't mind. 

FIELD AGENT
Let me see if I can lay my hands on what you are 
looking for. [he walks off to look]

MULDER
[to SCULLY] I thought you said you weren't coming. 

SCULLY
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half 
an hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the
blood and tissue samples I took from the fireman. 

MULDER
What did you find? 

SCULLY
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more 
information, and not without attracting the kind of attention I'd just as 
soon avoid right now. 

[The field agent returns with the fossils.] 

FIELD AGENT
Here you are. They're just fossils, and they weren't 
near the blast site so they won't tell you much. 

MULDER
[handing SCULLY a container of bone fragments]
Here, why don't you take a look at this. 

[SCULLY puts one of the bone fragments under the microscope and 
looks through it. She almost immediately turns to MULDER, who 
takes in her expression.] 

MULDER
You said these came from an archeological site? 

FIELD AGENT
I can show it to you right on the map. 


North Texas (Blackwood) 

[Parts and equipment are being packed up. A temperature-regulated 
transportation container is being moved next to the hole. 
BRONSCHWEIG is directing people.] 

BRONSCHWEIG
I want this container checked and recalibrated.
I want a steady, negative two degrees throughout the transport after 
I administer the vaccine. 

[BRONSCHWEIG, donned in a bio-hazard suit, climbs down the
ladder and prepares to administer the vaccine. He pulls back the 
curtain and finds that the body of the fireman has a large hole in it
and the alien being is gone. He pulls away his headgear to look 
around and goes back to the ladder, starting to climb up.] 

BRONSCHWEIG
It's gone! It's left the body, I think it's gestated. 
[he stops climbing.]  Wait, I can see it. [he climbs back down and 
pulls out a syringe and a small bottle of liquid.]  So much for little 
green men. I'm going to try to administer the vaccine. ____, I need 
you down here. [One of the men still above ground exits the camera 
view to go don a bio-hazard suit. BRONSCHWEIG puts the needle
into the small bottle, and draws back some of the vaccine. He looks 
back up, and cannot see the alien. He looks around, and the alien 
appears behind him, and draws its claws. It attacks him, slicing at 
his face. BRONSCHWEIG stabs the syringe into it, and it 
momentarily goes away from him. BRONSCHWEIG staggers to the 
ladder and clutches it.]   Help! I need help!  [he begins to climb the 
ladder, but the men above put the lid over the hole and seal it.] 
What are you doing?!  [The men above cover the clear lid with dirt.] 
What are you doing?! Oh God!  [The alien grabs BRONSCHWEIG's 
face and pulls him away from the camera.] 


Somerset England 

[Well Manicured Man (WMM) sits watching his grandchildren 
playing in the garden behind the mansion.  One of them falls 
and the others gather around, WMM looks concerned, then is 
approached by a servant.]

SERVANT
Phone for you, sir. 

WMM
[to phone]  Yes? 

CSM
We have a situation. The members are assembling. 

WMM
Is it an emergency? 

CSM
Yes. A meeting is set, tonight in London. We must determine 
a course. 

WMM
Who called this meeting? 

CSM
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis. 



London England

WMM
Has Strughold arrived? 

MAN
Yes, they're waiting for you in the library, sir. 

[In a small room, people are gathered around a small monitor,
an image of Mulder and Scully at the morgue is frozen onscreen.
WMM enters.] 

STRUGHOLD
We began to worry. 

WMM
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg. 

STRUGHOLD
While we have been made to wait, we've watched 
surveilance tapes which have raised more concerns. 

WMM
More concerns about what? 

STRUGHOLD
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization. 

FIRST ELDER
The virus has mutated. 

WMM
Into what? 

STRUGHOLD
A new extraterrestrial biological entity. 

WMM
My God! If this is true. All our work. They've been using us 
all along. 

STRUGHOLD
We're going to tell them what we've found, what we've 
learned by turning over a body infected by the gestating organism. 

WMM
In hope of what? Learning that it's true? That we are nothing 
but digestives for the creation of a new race of alien life-forms. By 
cooperating now, we are but beggers to our own demise. 

STRUGHOLD
Cooperation is the only chance of saving ourselves. 

CSM
They still need us to carry out their preparations. 

STRUGHOLD
We'll continue to use them as they use us. If only to 
play for more time, to continue work on our vaccine. 

WMM
My lateness might have been my absence. A course has 
already been decided. 

CSM
But there are complications. [looking at surveillance video] 
Mulder saw one of the infected bodies that we've destroyed in Dallas. 
He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him. 

WMM
Who? 

CSM
Kurtzweil we think. 

WMM
No one believes Kurztweil or his books. 

FIRST ELDER
Mulder believes. 

CSM
Then Kurtzweil must be removed. 

STRUGHOLD
As must Mulder.

WMM
Kill Mulder, we take the risk of turning one man's quest into 
a crusade. 

STRUGHOLD
Then you must take away what he holds most valuable. 
That with which he can't live without. 


Blackwood Texas 

MULDER
This is where the agent indicated on the map. 

SCULLY
There's no evidence of any archeological site or dig here. 

MULDER
And you're sure that those fossils had the same virus that 
the firemen had?

SCULLY
Yes, the bones were both porous, as if the virus were 
disgesting it. 

MULDER
And you've never seen that virus before. 

SCULLY
No. 

MULDER
Look at this. 

[MULDER and SCULLY walk over to a playground]

MULDER
This look like new grass to you? 

SCULLY
It looks pretty green for this climate. 

MULDER
Ground's dry about an inch down. This was laid recently. 

SCULLY
The equipment looks brand new too. 

MULDER
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks. 

[MULDER and SCULLY spot 3 children on bikes and approach them]

MULDER
HEY... 

SCULLY
Do you boys live around here? 

KID
Yeah. 

MULDER
You see anybody diggin' over there? 

KID
We're not supposed to talk about it. 

SCULLY
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that? 

KID
Nobody. 

MULDER
Nobody? The same nobody who built that playground,
nobody buy you those new bikes? 

SCULLY
I think you better tell us. 

KID
We don't even know you. 

SCULLY
Well, we're FBI Agents. 

KID
You're not FBI Agents. 

MULDER
How do you know? 

KID
Cause ya'll look like door-to-door salesmen. 

MULDER
[he pulls out his badge] Here, you wanna buy a badge? 

[After looking at MULDER's badge the kids point, in unison, to where 
the men had gone.] 

KID
They left about an hour ago, that a'way. 


Texas -- en route

[At a fork in the proverbial and literal road, MULDER and SCULLY 
discuss what they are chasing, and the best course of action.]

MULDER
Unmarked tanker trucks. What are archeologists hauling 
out in tanker trucks?

SCULLY
I don't know, Mulder.

MULDER
And where are they going with it?

SCULLY
That's the first question to answer if we're ever going to find 
them.

MULDER
(refering to directions) What are my choices?

SCULLY
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction. 
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.

MULDER
I think they went left.

SCULLY
I don't know why, but I think they went right.

[MULDER debates for a moment, and then in a leap of faith, symbolic 
of their partnership, he decides to go neither left nor right, but 
instead forges straight ahead.]

MULDER
Five years together, Scully. How many times I been wrong?
Never. About driving anyway. 

[After a long while of driving MULDER and SCULLY stop to look at 
the map. SCULLY gets out of the car annoyed and MULDER quips 
that he was at least right about the bomb. SCULLY details the irony 
of the fact that she has to be back in D.C. for a meeting which decides
her fate, and she is with him chasing what she refers to as phantom
tanker trucks.]

MULDER
I was right about the bomb, wasn't I? 

SCULLY
This is great, this is fitting. 

MULDER
What is? 

SCULLY
I have to be in Washington in eleven hours for a hearing 
that may effect one of the greatest decisions in my life, and I'm in 
the middle of nowhere Texas chasing phantom tanker trucks! 

MULDER
We're not chasing trucks. We're chasing evidence. 

SCULLY
Evidence of what exactly? 

MULDER
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide bodies 
infected with a virus. A virus you yourself detected. 

SCULLY
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks, 
they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks. 

MULDER
Well, maybe they do in these tanker trucks. 

SCULLY
What aren't you telling me here? Mulder? 

MULDER
(hesitant) The virus may be extraterrestrial.

SCULLY
I don't believe this... I don't... 

[As SCULLY was about to comment, a train complete with tankers 
passes them. As a singular unit, no longer squabbling about left, 
right or center, they chase after the train and their truths.]


A cornfield, domes in the middle of it all, surrounded by desert

SCULLY
This is weird. 

MULDER
Very weird. 

SCULLY
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the 
middle of the desert? 

MULDER
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop Poppers. 

[MULDER and SCULLY reach the domes and upon their entrance 
fans whirl sharply startling both.] 

SCULLY
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated. 

[They continue through the large open area of the structure.] 

MULDER
For the purpose of what? 

SCULLY
I think we're on top of a larger structure here... 

MULDER
You hear that? 

SCULLY
I hear a humming... Like electricity, high voltage maybe... 

[MULDER bends down, puts his head against the ground and listens] 

MULDER
Maybe... [pause] Maybe not. 

[MULDER continues to listen, the vents in the roof open] 

MULDER
Scully? 

SCULLY
Yeah? 

MULDER
Run!! 

[The vents in the floor open, and hundreds of bees pour out, MULDER 
and SCULLY head for the entrance, with MULDER a sizable distance 
ahead of SCULLY.] 

MULDER
Scully! 

SCULLY
I can't see! 

[MULDER turns back for SCULLY] 

MULDER
Grab my hand. 

[Grabbing her arm, MULDER leads her to the door and the fans blow 
off all the remaining clinging bees. They both run outside of the building.] 

MULDER
Did you get stung?

SCULLY
I don't think so. 

[A light is seen over the corn crops. Two black helicopters appear 
and MULDER and SCULLY begin to run through the crops to escape.]

MULDER
Scully! Talk to me, Scully! Dammit! Scully! 

SCULLY
Mulder! 

[They begin to run away from the crops, towards the car. 
The helicopters disappear.] 

SCULLY
Where'd they go? 


Washington DC, OPR 

[The FBI review panel waits for SCULLY, for her reassignment out of 
the X-Files. She enters, after trying to push her unruly hair into place
and straightening her suit.]

SKINNER
She's coming in now.

SCULLY
I apologize for making you wait. I have new evidence. 
These are bone fragments recovered from the bomb site... 

A.D.CASSIDY
You went back to Dallas? 

SCULLY
Yes... 

[While SCULLY is being questioned, MULDER goes to meet 
Kurtzweil at Casey's Bar.]

KURTZWEIL
Did you find anything? 

MULDER
Yeah. 

KURTZWEIL
What did it look like? 

MULDER
Bees, corn crops... 

[Back at the hearing]

A.D.CASSIDY
...and you have conclusive evidence of this? 

SCULLY
Well, not exactly conclusive... We're working on 
gathering conclusive evidence... 

[The audience is shown a bee crawling on the back of SCULLY's collar.]

A.D.CASSIDY
Working with who? 

SCULLY
(hesitating)
...with Agent Mulder. 

[Back to Casey's Bar.]

MULDER
What do you think they're for? 

KURTZWEIL
What do you think? 

MULDER
A transportation system. The crops polygenically altered, 
to carry a virus. 

KURTZWEIL
That would be my guess. 

MULDER
Your guess?!  I thought you said you had answers? 

KURTZWEIL
Yeah, well... I don't have them all... 

MULDER
(disgusted)
You didn't know my father... 

KURTZWEIL
Look, like I said, your father and I were old friends... 

MULDER
(angrily)
You've been using me to get information for 
your god-damned books! 

KURTZWEIL
Lower your voice! 

[Kurtzweil leaves through the back exit. MULDER follows him into 
the alley.]

MULDER
Kurtzweil? Kurtzweil! 

KURTZWEIL
Listen, you'd be shit out of luck if it wasn't for me. 
I'm putting my ass on the line... 

MULDER
Your ass? I just got chased through Texas by two 
unmarked helicopters! 

KURTZWEIL
And why do you think you're here talking to me today? 
These people don't make mistakes!


Mulder's Apartment

[Mulder is sitting in his apartment, a family picture album open as 
he stares at a young version of Kurtzweil at a family picnic. The door 
opens as Scully enters.]

MULDER
What's wrong? 

SCULLY
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately. 
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation. 

MULDER
You can't quit now, Scully. 

SCULLY
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you 
in person... 

MULDER
We are close to something here! We are on the verge!

SCULLY
You're on the verge, Mulder. Please don't do this to me. 

MULDER
After what you saw last night, after all you've seen, 
you can just walk away? 

SCULLY
I have, I did, it's done.

MULDER
I need you on this, Scully.

SCULLY
You don't need me, Mulder. You never have. I've just held 
you back. [pause]  I gotta go.  

[Scully goes out into the hall and Mulder follows her.]

MULDER
You wanna tell yourself that so you can quit with a clear
conscience, you can, but you're wrong.

SCULLY
Why did they assign me to you in the first place, Mulder? 
To debunk your work, to rein you in, to shut you down... 

MULDER
But you saved me. As difficult and as frustrating as it's 
been sometimes, your goddamned strict rationalism and science
have saved me a thousand times over. You've kept me honest ... 
made me a whole person. I owe you everything, Scully, and you owe 
me nothing ... I don't know if I wanna do this alone... I don't even know 
if I can ... and if I quit now, they win. 

[SCULLY looks at MULDER in complete awe. She walks into his 
embrace and they hug, as they are letting go SCULLY pulls MULDER
down to her and kisses his forehead. Their foreheads rest against 
each other, unsure of how to proceed, unsure of their new roles. 
MULDER then cups SCULLY's face with both hands, and leans in 
to kiss her. As their lips are about to touch, she pulls away.]

SCULLY
Ow! 

MULDER
[thinking he's done something wrong]  I'm sorry. 

SCULLY
Something stung me. 

MULDER
Must've gotten in your shirt. 

SCULLY
Mulder ... something's wrong.

MULDER
What?

SCULLY
I'm having lacinating pain in ...

MULDER
What?

SCULLY
... my chest.

MULDER
Scully ...

SCULLY
My motor functions are being affected.

MULDER
Scully ...

[Mulder gently but quickly lays her down upon the hallway floor]

SCULLY
My pulse is thready ... a funny taste in the back of my throat.

MULDER
You're going into anaphylaxic shock.

SCULLY
No ... I have no alergy.

[MULDER runs into his apartment and grabs the phone. 
He dials 911 with the emergency button.]

MULDER
(on phone)
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder, 
I have an emergency!  I have an agent down!

[The ambulance and paramedics arrive]

PARAMEDIC 1
Can you hear me? Can you say your name?

PARAMEDIC 2
She's got constriction in the throat and larynx.

PARAMEDIC 1
Passages are open. OK. Let's get her in the van 
right away. Look out. Coming through. Watch your back.

[Scully is loaded into the ambulance]

MULDER
She said she had a funny taste in the back of her throat. 
But there was no pre-existing allergy to bee sting. Now the bee that 
stung her might have been carrying a virus.

PARAMEDIC 1
Virus?

MULDER
Will you tell that to the doctor?

Various Paramedics Voices
"... virus ... advise ... reaction ... stat!

MULDER
What hos ... what hospital are ... [(the ambulance door 
closes, Mulder goes to the driver]  What hospital are you taking her to?

[The ambulance driver just looks back at him. He pulls a gun and fires 
at MULDER's head. MULDER falls. Seconds later, another ambulance 
pulls up. Cut to a scene of a runway. An unmarked cargo plane sits 
on the runway. The ambulance pulls up, and soldiers move SCULLY, 
who is now in a temperature-controlled container into the plane. 
The soldiers leave, as CSM stands in the plane, watching. As the 
door closes, all light is diminished in the camera's view and the 
screen fades out.]

FROHIKE
What are you looking at? 

LANGLY
His charts. 

FROHIKE
Put it down. 

LANGLY
I'll put it down when I'm ready to put it down. 

BYERS
He's waking up! 

FROHIKE
Mulder? 

MULDER
Oh god. Scarecrow, Cowardly lion... Toto. 

MULDER
What happened? 

BYERS
You were shot at point blank range, the bullet grazed the 
temporal lobe. 

LANGLY
A few centimeters to the left and we'd all be playing harps 
right now. 

MULDER
(shooting up in the bed) What happened to Scully? 

FROHIKE
Scully had a reaction to an Africanized honeybee that we 
found in your hallway. Now, you made a 911 call. That call was 
intercepted. 

MULDER
I've got to get that to Scully. 

SKINNER
Easy now, Mulder. Easy... Tell me where she is, 
I'll go get her.

MULDER
I don't know where she is. But I know someone who might.

SKINNER
How far do you think you can make it out there, how far 
do you think they'll let you make it, because they'll know the second 
you walk out that door. 

LANGLY
What can we do to help? 

MULDER
You can strip Byers naked... 

BYERS
What? 

MULDER
I need your clothes. 

[Langly, Frohike, and MULDER, who is disguised as Byers, exit the 
room. The guard outside the room looks in and sees Byers lying 
on the hospital bed, but does not realize that it is not really MULDER. 
The three walk down through the hospital as MULDER makes a call 
on his cell phone.

MULDER
(into phone)  It's Mulder... 



Casey's Bar, Southeast Washington, DC - The alley 

WMM
Dr. Kurtzweil, Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil. 

[Kurtzweil turns and runs back down the alley, but a car pulls up and
a man gets out. Kurtzweil stops. Cut to MULDER entering Casey's bar. 
He looks for Kurtzweil, but does not see him. MULDER exits the bar 
through the back, and looks to the left just in time to see WMM and 
his driver closing the trunk of the car. WMM turns to face MULDER.]

WMM
Mr. Mulder. 

MULDER
What happened to Kurtzweil? 

WMM
He's come and gone. 

MULDER
I want to know where Scully is. 

WMM
[holding a small pouch] The location of Agent Scully and the 
means to save her life. [gesturing to the car] Please.... 

[The driver opens the door. Cut to show the car driving and MULDER 
and WMM talking inside the car. MULDER looks down at a vial of liquid 
and a piece of paper with coordinates.] 

WMM
...A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been 
infected with. It must be administered within 96 hours. That leaves 
you little time to get to those coordinates. 

MULDER
You're lying. 

WMM
No. But I have no means of proving otherwise.The virus is 
extraterriestrial. We know very little about it except that it was the 
original inhabitant of this planet. 

MULDER
[unbelieving] A virus... 

WMM
What is a virus, but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? 
Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates--and attacks. 

MULDER
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? 
A disease? 

WMM
No. For God's sake, you've got it all backwards! AIDS, the 
Ebola virus, on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This 
virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs. 

MULDER
What do you mean walked? 

WMM
Your aliens, Agent Mulder. Your little green men who arrived 
here millions of years ago. Those that remained have been lying 
dormant, underground since the last ice age in the form of an evolved
pathogen, waiting to be reconstituted by the alien race when it comes 
to colonize our planet -- using us as hosts. Against this we have no 
defense, nothing but a weak vaccine. Do you see why it was kept 
secret? Why even the best men, men like your father, could not let 
the truth be known. Until Dallas we believed that the virus would simply 
control us, that mass infection would make us a slave race. Imagine 
our surprise when they began to gestate. 

MULDER
Why are you telling me this? 

WMM
For the sake of my children. Once it's learned what I have told 
you, my life will be over. 

[WMM looks at the driver.] 

MULDER
Where's Kurtzweil? [pauses and gets no response] 
I'd like to get out of the car now. Stop the car! 

WMM
Driver. [the car stops.]  The men I work with will stop at nothing 
to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the inevitable. 
I was ordered to kill Dr. Kurtzweil, as I was ordered to kill you.

[Well Manicured Man shoots the Limo Driver in the back of the head.]

WMM
Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.  Get out of the car. 

MULDER
Why? The upholstery is already ruined. 

WMM
Get out of the car! [MULDER gets out of the car.] You have 
precious little time, Mr. Mulder. [MULDER slams the door shut angrily.]
What I've given you the alien colonists don't yet know exists. The 
vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction 
into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate 
plans we have so assiduously protected for the last 50 years. 

MULDER
What do you mean, may have? 

WMM
Find Agent Scully. Only then will you realize the scope and 
grandeur of the project. Go. Go now! 

[MULDER starts to walk away, but as WMM reenters the limo 
it explodes.]



Wilkes Land Antarctica 48 hrs later 

[MULDER is driving a Sno-Cat and the gas gauge keeps flipping down
to indicate the tank is empty. He taps it with his finger a few times, 
each time the gauge returns to empty.]

MULDER
Oh shit! 

[He exits at the base of a craggy hillside, climbs up and sees CSM
leaving one of two domes in a truck. Mulder now races to the station 
through the heavy snow. Just before he reaches the domes, he falls
through the ice as it collapses beneath his feet and he drops into a 
deep crevice. He lands on a metallic surface or structure covered in 
the snow with a vent blowing out hot air and forming a pocket in the 
ice. Mulder pulls himself through the vent and ends up inside the 
metallic structure. He looks around, and spies a prehistoric man 
encased in ice. He soldiers on and comes upon a huge part of the 
structure, open like an operating theatre in a hospital. At the bottom, 
something catches his eye. Racks of coffin-like cryopods are moving
as if on a conveyer belt. Mulder slides down another tube to reach it, 
nearly falling off into the abyss below. He reaches the conveyer belt,
finds Scully's clothes and her cross necklace in a cryopod, and 
watches in horror as the others pass by, all containing frozen 
humans trapped with expressions of confusion and horror etched 
into their faces for all time. Suddenly, he spots Scully's face and 
starts hammering at the ice in a desperate attempt to free her. 
He breaks through, releasing an ocean of goo which encased her
naked body. He jabs her with the syringe containing the vaccine 
and begins dragging out a tube-like material she had jammed 
down her throat. Just before he pulls it all out, the vaccine takes 
effect and the tube starts to shrivel. It's dying and affecting the 
whole metallic structure as it begins to shake, rattle and roll 
around them. Scully starts to gulp in air as the tube is removed.]

MULDER
Scully? 

[Up above this action, CSM has returned to the scene.]

CSM
Everybody down below. We may have a security breach. 
If you're not armed, arm yourselves. 

[Back below, Mulder tries to talk to Scully.]

MULDER
Breathe! Can you breathe? 

[SCULLY coughs several times. Spitting up what's left of the slimy 
substance.] 

SCULLY
(in a bare whisper)  Cold. 

MULDER
I'm going to get you out of here. 

[Mulder pulls her out of her enclosure as he breaks away the last of 
the ice. Next we see her dressed in some of Mulder's clothing, 
dragged away from the pods which are now starting to stir from within. 
The vaccine has affected the whole structure, as the bodies were all 
obviously attached to one creature.]

MULDER
We've got to keep moving.

SCULLY
I can't.

MULDER
Yeah, you can.

[MULDER carries her to the vent.]

MULDER
Reach up and grab that vent. Scully, grab the vent! Scully? 

[Scully has passed out. Mulder checks for a pulse then resuscitates 
her with a mean version of CPR.]

MULDER
Breathe, Scully. Breathe. BREATHE! 

[Spitting up and indicating for MULDER to come closer to her so he 
can hear her.]

SCULLY
I had you big time. 

MULDER
Grab the vent. 

[SCULLY grabs the vent and pulls herself up. MULDER starts to climb 
up. One of the aliens breaks the pod and reaches out with its hand for 
MULDER. It grabs MULDER's leg.] 

SCULLY
Mulder! 

MULDER
Keep moving, Scully! 

[MULDER kicks it away and pulls himself up. They both climb through 
the tunnel and pull themselves up from where MULDER originally fell 
through the snow/ice. MULDER looks back and sees that the ice is 
cracking. He picks SCULLY up and they begin to run away. The
cracking ice overtakes them, and they fall back down, but slide off 
of the surface of the rising ship and land on the edge of the newly
formed crater. MULDER watches the spaceship as it flies overhead,
his face glows with a heart-melting grin of childlike wonder and awe. 
Scully's face is turned towards the snow, too tired to move, as Mulder 
says, almost along with the audience ...]

MULDER
Scully, you have to see this!

[It's quiet, it's barely a mutter above a whisper, but Scully DOES say, 
"I see it." Spent from exhaustion, Mulder drops his head into the snow 
and Scully scoots her body over to cover him from the freezing cold. 
The camera pans back to show two lone figures perched alone on the 
edge of the crater left by the departing spaceship.]



Washington DC OPR 

CASSIDY
In light report on these findings and in light of the narrative 
I am now hearing, my official report is incomplete--pending these new 
facts I'm being asked to reconcile. Agent Scully, though there is 
now direct evidence that a federal agent MAY have been involved in 
the bombing, the other events you've laid down here are too incredible
on their own, and quite frankly implausible in their connections. 

SCULLY
What is it you find incredible?

CASSIDY
Well, where would you like me to start? So many of the 
events described in your report defy belief. Antarctica is a LONG way 
from Dallas, Texas, Agent Scully. I-- I can't very well submit a report 
to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees 
and corn crops do not quite fit under the rubric of domestic terrorism.

SCULLY
No, they don't.

CASSIDY
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of 
ANY organization with an attributible motive. I realize that the ordeal 
you've endured has clearly affected you. But the holes in your account 
leave this panel no choice but to delete these references to our final 
report to the Justice Department--until which time hard evidence 
becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an 
investigation.

[SCULLY walks over to her and hands her the vial containing the bee
found in Mulder's hallway.]

SCULLY
I don't believe the FBI currently has an investigative unit 
qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.


The Capital Mall

[SCULLY finds MULDER sitting on a bench by the reflecting pool 
reading a newspaper.]

MULDER
There's an interesting work of fiction on page 24. 
Mysteriously, our names have been omitted. They're burying this 
thing, Scully. They're just going to dig a new hole and cover it up.

SCULLY
I told OPR everything I know. What I experienced, the virus, 
how it's spread by the bees from pollen in transgenic crops.

MULDER
You're wasting your time, Scully. They'll never believe you, 
not unless your story can be programmed, categorized, or easily 
referenced. 

SCULLY
Then we'll go over their heads. 

MULDER
No. No. How many times have we been here before, Scully? 
Right here. So close to the truth and now with what we've seen and
what we know to be right back at the beginning with nothing.

SCULLY
This is different, Mulder. 

MULDER
No it isn't. You were right to want to quit. You were right 
to want to leave me. You should get as far away from me as you can! 
I'm not going to watch you die, Scully, because of some hollow 
personal cause of mine. Go be a doctor. Go be a doctor while you 
still can.

SCULLY
I can't. I won't. Mulder, I'll be a doctor, but my work is here 
with you now. That virus that I was exposed to, whatever it is, it has 
a cure. You held it in your hand. How many other lives can we save?
Look. If I quit now, they win.

[MULDER gets up, SCULLY takes his hand and they walk off.]



Foum Tataouine, Tunisia

[TD NOTE
At some point during the next scene, we see a white 
tanker truck with the name "Nature's Best Corn Oil" written on the
side.]

[A helicopter arrives by a cornfield in the desert, CSM gets out and 
walks over to STRUGHOLD.]

STRUGHOLD
You look hot and miserable. Why have you traveled 
all this way? 

CSM
We have business to discuss. 

STRUGHOLD
We have regular channels. 

CSM
This involves Mulder. 

STRUGHOLD
Ah. That name, again and again. 

CSM
He's seen more than he should have. 

STRUGHOLD
What has he seen? Of the whole he has seen but 
pieces. 

CSM
He's determined now. Reinvested. 

STRUGHOLD
He is but one man. One man alone cannot fight 
the future. 

CSM
Yesterday, I received this.
