THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN TEXAS

 

OPENING TITLE. CARDS

After the Universal logo, we open on a slow pan across a
turn-of-the-century dressing table. We see old photo-
graphs showing a small group of whores with their madam,
MISS WULLA JEAN, and the Sheriff of the small town of
Gilbert, SHERIFF JACK ROY WALLACE. There are also mementos
on the dressing table: a watch, reading glasses, a jeweled
hand mirror, a hair brush, etc. We play the "Production
Company", the "Miller-Milkis-Boyett Presents" and the "Film
By" credits over these things and then push in on an antique
stereopticon with the double photo image of a small, newly
built, two-story Victorian house situated on a wooded hill
in the East Texas countryside.

The two images optically move together to form one image.
They become live action and the NARRATOR begins as we push
in on the house where a horse and wagon is pulling up to the
porch.

NARRATOR
It was the nicest little whorehouse
you ever saw. It lay about a mile
outside the city limits.

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1910

Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace and Miss Wulla Jean pose with the
girls on the front porch of the house as a photographer
takes their picture with an old flash-powder camera.

NARRATOR
Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace picked it
out for Miss Wulla Jean and her
girls in 1910 when they moved there
from over the hardware store on
Main Street.

We pan down through the leaves of a tree to reveal two girls
working in a little garden by the side of the house. It has
the appearance of a turn-of-the-century ladies college as
the other girls cut flowers, sit around the grape arbor and
sun-dry their long hair.

(NOTE: We can bleed in the color slowly beginning with
black and white, then sepia, then full color during the
1940's.)

NARRATOR
(singing)
Oh, the little house lay in a
Green Texas glade
Where the trees were as coolin'
As fresh lemonade
Soft summer wind
Had a trace of perfume
And a fan was turnin’
In every room.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY = 1900

We see the old ceiling fans turning, followed by several
shots through the fans of the girls making love under the
sheets, squeaking mattress shots, bouncing bedsprings, with
a chamber pot under the bed.

CHORUS
Twenty fans were turnin'
They were turnin'
Twenty fans were turnin’
In every room
Fevers were a~burnin'
They were burnin'
And they had to have
A way to cool down.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH - NIGHT - 1914

Miss Wulla Jean stands at the front door welcoming customers
entering the house. We see the keys of a pianola start
playing ragtime as the girls and customers break into a
turn-of-the-century-style dance.

NARRATOR
Miss Wulla Jean had a strict set of
rules but she liked her ladies, as
she called them, to treat her
customers real good.

The dancing continues, as Miss Wulla Jean makes sure her
girls are behaving in a ladylike way.

NARRATOR
She put a pianola in the parlor to
sorta help break the ice. A feller
could ask a girl to dance or if he
held back a little, she'd ask him.
And pretty soon they'd get a little
business going «~ two dollars worth.

The dance ends with a couple upstairs falling into bed.
#02139 3

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH ~ NIGHT - 1914
Doughboys are coming and going.

NARRATOR
By the First World war, it was one
of the better-known pleasure
palaces in all Texas.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH KITCHEN - DAY - 1914

A girl takes a cookie sheet from the kitchen oven and walks
out to the garden.

NARRATOR
And as the girls baked cookies....

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH GARDEN ~ DAY - 1914

The girl passes by other girls knitting socks, packing
cookies, writing letters and wrapping bandages for the Red
Cross.

NARRATOR
..and knitted socks for the guys
at the front, the soldiers there
bragged of the little house back
home.

MALE CHORUS
(singing)
It had nice watermelons
All covered with vines
And a vegetable garden
A few slender pines
White painted fence
With the roses in bloom
And a fan was turnin’
In every room.

INT. A ROOM IN THE CHICKEN RANCH - NIGHT - 1918
A girl is washing a DOUGHBOY'S privates in a hand basin.

NARRATOR
Miss Wulla Jean insisted that each
girl check her customer real good
for the clap and wash him off with
soap and warm water. Some of the
fellas claimed that was the best
part.

DOUGHBOY
Ooocoweeeeeh!

The Doughboy takes off his hat and throws it off screen
right.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH PARLOR - DAY - 1920 10

The hat (now a straw boater) lands on a hat tree standing in
the parlor. The Doughboy (now with longer hair) is welcomed
by Wulla Jean at the front door.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH PARLOR - NIGHT - 1920 il

We pull back from a new phonograph to reveal couples dancing
around it -- letter-sweatered college boys and bow-tied
businessmen.

NARRATOR .
When the war ended, Miss Wulla Jean
celebrated with a new phonograph in
the parlor.

The girls Charleston with their customers and we intercut
with the bouncing beds upstairs.

INT. AN UPSTAIRS ROOM IN THE CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1920 12

A half-dressed couple ends the dance by kicking the door
closed. The music fades out and a plaintive harmonica takes
over. We pan to an open window and see the dilapidated
grape arbor, while wind and dust blow across the landscape.

NARRATOR

But prosperity blew away like a

dust storm and in came the Hoover

Depression.
EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1930'S 13
Extreme long shot of the little house looking very bleak. A
hot, dusty wind is blowing as an old, broken-down car makes
its way down the long drive away from the house.
INT. A ROOM IN THE CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1930'S 14

A GIRL shuts the window, closing out the blowing wind. She
turns to a young farmer, who is carrying a gunny sack.

GIRL
Now, I'm sorry, honey. I gotta
have my three dollars first.
Miss Wulla Jean don't allow no
honeyfuggin' 'til I pay my rent.

The farmer picks up the sack and reaches inside.

NARRATOR
It wasn't always easy to come up
with three dollars, especially
during the hard times.

The farmer pulls a chicken out of the bag and holds it up
proudly for barter. The Girl sighs:

GIRL
well, you just keep that in the bag
and I'll take it out back soon as
we're finished.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH PARLOR ~ NIGHT - 1930'S 1s

We see some girls accepting payment from three farmers with
chickens on their laps.

NARRATOR
And so the girls began accepting
poultry in trade -- one bird, one
lay....
EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1930'S 16

The girls are feeding the chickens and as we pull back we
see they have built a temporary pen full of several hundred
birds.

NARRATOR
And that's how the place got its
name -~ The Chicken Ranch!
INT. CHICKEN RANCH PARLOR - NIGHT - 1940'S 17

The camera pulls back from the new jukebox where couples are
jitterbugging around it to a big band sound.

Miss Wulla Jean nails up a wartime portrait of F.D.R. in the
hallway.

A bugle calls and upstairs a young customer jumps out of bed.

The girls and their guests, now dressed in World War II
uniforms, dance down the steps and out the front door.

Int’. CHICKEN RANCH KITCHEN ~ DAY - 1940'S

In a replay of the 1914 cookie-baking sequence, a girl takes
a cookie sheet from the oven and walks outside.

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH GARDEN ~ DAY - 1940'S

Out in the victory garden, the girls, thirty years later,
are still doing their patriotic bit for the boys at the
front. One of the girls, sealing a letter with a lipstick
kiss, turns off-screen at the sound of an approaching car.

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1950'S

Fifties-style music accompanies the arrival of a convertible
full of crew cut college boys. They pull up to the porch as
a young black woman called JEWEL waves them a welcome.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1950'S

Jewel takes the boys' money and they file through the front
door joining other customers dancing rock and roll in the
parlor. Miss Wulla Jean is replacing Truman's picture with
Eisenhower's.

InT. A ROOM IN THE CHICKEN RANCH - NIGHT - 1950'S

Three guys, careful to keep their ducktail hairdo's neatly
combed, dance with their girls and somersault them into bed.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1960'S

Jewel passes a portrait of Kennedy as she walks over to
Sheriff Jack Roy and his deputies leaving with two low-
life characters they have just arrested. Miss Wulla Jean
congratulates hin, while in the parlor customers dance to
the jukebox.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - 1960'S

Jewel and Miss Wulla Jean are at the “presidential Wall"
taking down the picture of L.B.J. Miss Wulla Jean ages from
standing with a cane to sitting in a wheelchair while we see
cuts of Jewel putting up Nixon and taking him down, putting
up Ford and taking him down, and then finally, at Miss Wulla
Jean's insistance, putting up L.B.J. to be nailed to the
wall and left there permanently.

NARRATOR
For over three generations the
little house went about its
business while the town prospered,
and those folks that couldn't
approve of the Chicken Ranch at
least decided it fell under the
principle of peaceful coexistence.

Miss Wulla Jean nods with satisfaction at her favorite Texas
president, puts down her stereopticon on the hall table and
Jewel wheels her away. We push in on the stereopticon and
see it contains the old sepia shot of the little house taken
so many long years ago.

NARRATOR
Course, if you grew up anywhere in
Texas, you knew at an early age
that they were selling something
out there other than poultry.

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - PRESENT 25

The helicopter shot. As we swoop across the countryside and
up toward the little house on the hill, the music becomes
wilder and picks up speed. Two cars, a farmer's pickup and
an Army jeep are flying up the old dirt road to the front of
the house.

CHORUS
Twenty fans were turnin'
They were turnin'
Twenty fans were turnin'
In every room
Fevers were a-burnin' -
They were burnin'
And they had to have
A way to cool down.

The customers come in the door and, grabbing the girls, do
the Texas Twist dance through the house.

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - SUNRISE - PRESENT 28
The satisfied customers are leaving, getting into the
collegiate Volkswagons and executive Pontiacs.

JEWEL

Y'all come back now, hear?
The customers respond to Jewel's cry as if asked for an
encore, and so...they turn and run into the house, nearly
knocking Jewel over in the process.
INT. CHICKEN RANCH - VARIOUS ROOMS - NIGHT - PRESENT 29

The music doubles in tempo and so do the fans. A montage of
fun filled sexual shenanigans, cutting from the dancing in
the parlor to the bouncing beds upstairs.

CHORUS
Twenty fans were turnin'

she's been stuck on Ed Earl for
years, ever since her husband

Dulcie Mae is pouring coffee and she looks off at someone
shouting in the town square. The customers look off, too.

NARRATOR
Humm...What's that commotion out
there?

MODENE
Morning, Rita.

DEPUTY FRED WILKINS is coming out of Ed Earl's office. He
is swept back inside by the force of Modene's entrance.

MODENE
Morning, Deputy Fred.

She plants herself in front of the sheriff's desk, where

ED EARL, leaning back in his chair, is whittling chains from
a block of wood. Behind his desk hang portraits of all nine
County Sheriffs ending with Jack Roy Wallace and Ed Earl
Dodd.

MODENE
Ed Earl, now listen up. You've got
yourself a problem.

Ed Earl looks up and tips his hat back on his head.

ED EARL
Morning, Miss Modene.

MODENE
It just ain't right for Tucker
Faylin to keep on doing this. I've
talked to him. I've talked to
you. There is a law in this
county, Sheriff, and it's up to you

EXT. BEAUTY SHOP = DAY 39

A mule is standing in front of Miss Modene's car, with his
behind sitting on the highly-polished hood. A few
townspeople have gathered around to look at the bizarre
sight.

Ed Earl, with his guns strapped on, looking like he's going
out to meet Billy the Kid, walks across the street from the
Courthouse. Behind him are Rita and Deputy Fred; while
Miss Modene, keeping up beside him, continues to babble.

MODENE
I came out of the beauty shop and
there he was, standing right in
front of my car. I tried to back
up, but I couldn't, so I went
forward slowly, figuring that he'd
move, but he just buckled up his
back legs and sat right down on my
hood.

The group stops as Modene points at her predicament.
Ed Earl is not fazed at all. He walks up to the mule and
addresses him, man to man.

ED EARL
Mornin', mule. I'm Sheriff Ed Earl
Dodd and I've got a request here
for you to, pardon the expression,
move your ass.

INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY 40

Ed Earl continues addressing the mule.

EARL
I'm sorry you're taking it this
way. I don't want to lose my
_ temper because, as folks will tell
you, that can be real trouble.

MODENE
Sheriff, you got to get him off
there. Where's Tucker Faylin?

DEPUTY FRED
Why don't you give him a tug?

ED EARL

Shut up, Fred. Now, listen, mule.
I don't want to get physical with
you. I want to be real polite.
So, I'm asking you for the last
time...Move!

The mule stares back at him and is singularly unimpressed.
Ed Earl gives up.

ED EARL
Okay. If that's your decision.

He takes a cheroot from his breast pocket and puts it in his
mouth. He strikes a match on his belt buckle and lights the
cigar. Modene is very agitated at Ed Earl's calm and his
lack of progress.

MODENE
What are you going to do, Sheriff?
I'm expected back home.

Ed Earl walks out of frame. A quick cut of the mule's tail
being lifted off the hood. The mule looks over his shoulder
to see what's happening.

Just about the time Ed Earl took

Jean passed away.

INT. CHICKEN RANCH PARLOR ~ NIGHT

Jewel, now more mature, is greeting customers at the front
door and taking their money. Miss Wulla Jean's black crepe
draped portrait hangs on the wall and couples are still

Suddenly the place is full of customers who pair off with
the girls and begin dancing.

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - SUNRISE 5E

A rooster standing on a fence post crows to greet the rising
sun. Last night's guests come straggling out, feeling spent
but happy. The girls yawn and stretch and wave good-bye
from the porch or the upstairs windows. Everybody looks
very contented.

NARRATOR

And so the Chicken Ranch continued

to live in peace with the town and
the folks there took secret pride

in the oldest established, permanently
operating, non-floating whorehouse

in Texas...that is, until about a

year ago last Thanksgiving.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 57
In a cloud of dust, Ed Earl speeds his sheriff's car down a
country road.

He glances at his watch and steps on the gas.
INT. SHERIFF'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY 59
Rita, seated at her desk, has finished writing out a receipt.
RITA
I can't tell you how thrilled we
are with this contribution,

Miss Mona. Here's your receipt.

She hands the receipt to Mona, who is standing at the counter
in front of her.

MONA
Thank you, Rita.

RITA
Those kids will be so excited. And
the Mayor, too. Why, the town
council will probably vote you
another plaque.

Hello, Dulcie Mae. You know

DULCIE MAE
Yes, of course. We've met.
Mornin’.

MONA
How are you?

RITA

Isn't this wonderful. Miss Mona
has capped the goal for the Little
League Fund Campaign.

DULCIE MAE
How nice. On behalf of my son and
his teammates, I'd like to thank
you.

MONA
Tell them I'll be well repaid when
they take the championship this
year. Good-bye, Rita.

Mona starts for the door.

RITA
I'm sorry the Sheriff wasn't here
to thank you. He drove over to
Meritsville. He'll be gone all

afternoon.

Well, tell him i said hi.

Sure are. The Sheriff's real
particular about the security out
there.

MONA
Well, some night when you're not on
duty you drop on by. I'm sure the
girls would like to show their
appreciation.

DEPUTY FRED
Oh, Miss Mona, shucks. You know
I'm a married man.

MONA

Ed Earl strides across the living room to the bedroom, sees

a jacket flung over a chair, fingers it for a moment, smiles

to himself, then flings open the bedroom door.

INT. ED EARL'S BEDROOM - DAY 66

Ed Earl stops in the doorway and his face falls at what he
sees.

ED EARL
Dammit!

We cut and see a figure lying in bed in the darkened room.
The lights turn on. Mona is lying in his bed with a sheet
pulled up coyly to her chin. She smiles at him.

MONA
What's the matter?
ED EARL
You've gotten into bed already.
MONA
So?
ED EARL

I've told you a hundred times,
watching you undress is the best
part.

MONA
The best part?

ED EARL
Well, maybe not the best part, but
certainly in the top two.

MONA
Well then, Ed Earl....

She throws off the sheet and we see that she's lying in bed
fully clothed. Ed Earl laughs.

He starts toward the bed, but she bounces out and picks up a
package from her tote bag.

MONA
Now, just hold it for a second.
I've got a surprise for you. I
picked up a package this morning
from the post office. It's the
latest thing from Frederick's of
Hollywood.

She holds up a black shorty negligee. He isn't very
impressed.

ED EARL
Not much to it.

MONA
I think I can fill it out.

She goes into the bathroom. He laughs and shouts after her.

ED EARL
I'll bet you can.

He quickly undoes his tie and takes off his shirt.

ED EARL
I swear to God, Mona, there ain't a
woman in the world that can get me
as excited as you can.

MONA (v.o.)
Even after all these years we been
meeting like this?

EARL
Every year with you, darlin', is

negligee.

ED EARL
Woweeee! That was quick.

MONA
I've had a lot of practice getting
in and out of my clothes. What do
you think?

She models it for him.

ED EARL
Hot damn, Mona, it makes me feel
real sexy.

MONA

You don't look very sexy.

ED EARL
(taken aback)
What do you mean? I look like I
always look.

MONA
That's the problem. It's those damn
boxer shorts. I can't stand the
look of those droopy white drawers.

ED EARL
These? What's the matter with them?
I always wear boxer shorts. I've
worn them for years.

MONA
They look it.

ED EARL
This is a brand new pair. And what
do you mean I don't look sexy?
People have always said I look sexy.
They say I have a sexy quality.

MONA
You do, but those boxer shorts
don't. Now, look here. This is

He shuffles over to her with his pants still around his boots

and takes a look at them.

ED EARL
Looks like a Japanese sling shot.

MONA
It's a pair of jockey shorts with
little silver snaps on the side.

ED EARL
I'm not getting into those. They'd
kill me.

MONA

They cost me twenty dollars, plus
postage, Ed Earl, and I want you to
wear them.

ED EARL
Twenty dollars for that little
thing? You got screwed.

MONA
Come on, Ed Earl.

ED EARL
I'm not putting them on.

MONA
If they look half as good as I
think they will, you won't have to
keep them on for long.

ED EARL
Mona, I'm not going to wear that
thing. They're ridiculous.
They're embarassing.

MONA

Mona laughs and takes the phone off the hook. She goes to a
closet and brings out a pillow.

MONA
I saw Dulcie Mae in town today.

Ed Earl talks from the bathroom.

ED EARL (v.o0.)
Oh, yeah?

MONA
I_ expect you're going out to her
place for Thanksgiving dinner?

ED EARL (v.0.)
Don't I always?

MONA
Well, you better start checking
that turkey, 'cause there's a hook
inside that's gonna land you right
over at the wedding chapel.

ED EARL (v.0o.)
Not me, Mona. I don't believe in

ED EARL
Yeah. How was it?

MONA
But I hardly saw them.

ED EARL
That's too bad, because I ain't
going to parade around this room
like some damn model.

MONA
Come on, Ed Earl. Do it for me.

ED EARL
No.

MONA
I just want to take a look at them.

ED EARL
No.

Mona lifts up the bottom of the sheet.

Oh, Ed Earl, I like a lot of
things, but these afternoons with

Melvin P. Thorpe. He's that crazy

a consumer has a complaint. He's
a menace to the business community.

DEPUTY FRED
He's the fella who put the peanuts
back in the chocolate bar.

ED EARL
What?

He made the makers of the Peanut
Delight candy bar admit they put
less peanuts in each bar than they
advertise and got them to change
their ways.

Sounds like a pretty tough customer.

(singing)
Bein' born was the worst and the first
Mistake I ever made
The doctor didn't spank me
He just slapped me in the face
And the cup of love was always quenchin'
Someone else's thirst
Leaving me to swallow
The bitter taste of hurt.

‘Cause I was raised an orphan
Never wanted as a kid

Until the year I turned thirteen
Then everybody did —

Strangers passed me back and forth
Men just took me as they pleased
And others had a Cinderella slave
To cook and clean and weave.

Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose you have to play

The hand that life has dealt you

And it's a gamble either way.

On a dusty road at fifteen

In a yellow cotton dress

With the desert sun like an angry dragon
Breathin' down my neck

And the dry cracked plains that made me think
Of a prehistoric time

Should I fear what lay before me

Less than what I'd left behind.

A fifteen year old girl don't have
No trouble hitchin' rides

But sometimes when you're ridin' free
You'll pay the highest price

On back roads, and in backseats

And in cheap highway motels

But what's a few more strangers

In a life of nothin' else.

Underneath a scarlet light

On the doorstep of a stranger

On a cold and rainy night

When I walked into the parlor here
The pieces seemed to fit

I was good at pleasin' strangers
So I made the most of it.

Either way it's all a gamble
So view the stakes and know the odds
Lay your cards upon the table
Do your dealin' from the top.

Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose you have to play

at Mona. A look of recognition passes between them. Shy
looks up at Jewel.

SHY
Miss Mona's gonna let me stay.

That's wonderful, child, but after

Mona smiles at Jewel and walks out to the hallway to beckon
to the girls passing by.

MONA
Girls, come on in here.

Ginger and Ruby Rae enter. Mona introduces them to Shy.

MONA

INT. TV STATION - NIGHT 83

Ed Earl is following a Page down the aisle of the TV studio

Come in.

Ed Earl enters.

MELVIN P. THORPE is sitting in his white T-shirt and
American flag boxer shorts while he puts the finishing
touches to the straightening of his silver-haired wig.
Ed Earl is a little surprised.

Mister Thorpe?

Melvin looks up in the mirror, sees him and jumps up with a
smile.

MELVIN
I know you.

ED EARL
You do?

MELVIN

Aren't you Sheriff Ed Earl Doda
from over in Lanville County?

ED EARL
That's right, how did you....

MELVIN
Well, this is surely my pleasure...

enthusiastically)
My honor. What brings you up here
to Houston? Please, sit down.

holsters, handcuffs and white cowboy boots.

Well, it's the show I want to talk
to you about, Mister Thorpe.

MELVIN

You watch the show, Ed?

EARL
Well, I....

MELVIN

Last week was the best rating we

Commissioner driving a city car
while he was on vacation! We
broke a thirty share. And it's
affecting my pieces on the late
night news. Up! Up! Up! They
love my little report.

EARL

I've heard you're very popular.
MELVIN

The power of television -- of

public exposure -- is so great it
scares me. I swear I could get
the Mayor's own children to throw
rocks at him. Which show did you
like best?

Well, I...I thought the peanuts in

bits or nut chips. We're talking a
full nut!

ED EARL
I can see that.

MELVIN
Thank God we still live in a
society where anything that's phony
or dishonest can't stand the light
of day.

He puts on his shirt over his padded shoulders and gets one
pad caught. Ed@ Earl points it out.

ED EARL
Your pad there....

MELVIN
Oh, thanks...Yes, most corporations
involved in false advertising will
just laugh at a fifty dollar fine,
but if you show up with a TV camera
and give tem bad publicity, they
shape up faster than goose shit
through a tin horn.

ED EARL
It's that bad publicity that I want
to talk to you about. Sometimes it
can hurt people. Like this report
I hear you're planning on the
Chicken Ranch. That place has been
operating peacefully for a long
time. Hell, I wouldn't be
surprised if your granddaddy took
your daddy out there to learn about
the birds and the bees.

ED EARL
The point I want to make is every
schoolboy in the state knows about
it, most politicians have slept
there, and the town, the Mayor and
the folks who elected me want to
keep things the way they are.

MELVIN
What is your interest in this
whorehouse, Sheriff?

ED EARL

Well, my deputies patrol out there,
stop fights before they start. The
girls' police records are checked,
so are their health cards. And as
for getting information that helps
us solve crimes, why the Chicken
Ranch is a better intelligence-
gathering operation than all those
FBI flyers they keep mailing me.

MELVIN
You know, Sheriff, it just struck
me. We're in the same profession.

ED EARL
What's that?

MELVIN
Law enforcement. I'm out there
fighting for the rights of the
public just like you. We're both
of us protecting the people -+ you
in the old way; me in the new.

ED EARL
The new?

MELVIN
Television! I'm the electronic
bounty hunter. I use a camera; you
use a gun.

Ed Earl is not impressed with this comparison. He begings
talking tough.

I'm no moralizer. I leave all that
to the preacher.

Ed Earl is a bit: taken back by this admission and a little
confused. - Lae

ED EARL
Really? Well, I'm glad to hear -
that. The Mayor was feeling that
you'd stir up a lot of unnecessary
publicity.

MELVIN
Unnecessary publicity! He's got me
all wrong. I'm not one of those
sensation mongers out for their
own egos.

He finishes dressing and stands looking at himself in front
of the mirror.

MELVIN
What do you think?

ED EARL
(pause)
It's...different.

MELVIN
I designed it myself. No, you tell
your Mayor he's got nothing to fear
from me on that score.

ED EARL
Really? Well, he'll be happy to
hear that.

MELVIN

I'm a lawman. That's my interest.
The law! Right, pardner.

He grabs Ed Earl's hand and shakes it. Ed Earl has still
not gotten a clear bead on this eccentric character, but

Nonsense. You are exactly what the
public wants to see. Trust me.
Look, we'll talk about it after the
show. I want you to be my guest.
This is the sponsor's booth. Just
sit in there and make yourself
comfortable. Bourbon, beer,
anything you want.

ED EARL
Thanks.

MELVIN
Not at all. I admire you,

He leaves and Ed Earl, not too sure of himself and thinking
he needs a drink, goes into the booth and sits down. He

The townspeople run for cover, put look on happily as Melvin
and the TV crew hop in their two trucks and drive away- Ed
Earl puts his gun back in the holster and mutters proudly to
himself.

ED EARL
So long, pardner.

He looks around -- the crowd comes out from hiding and gives
him a wild ovation. Billy is thrilled and points Ed Earl
out to his friends.

BILLY .
He's my friend. He's coming over
to my house to watch the Aggie game.

Ed Earl is accepting the adulation of the crowd. He gets
into his car. Dulcie Mae comes over.

’ DULCIE MAE
You were wonderful, Ed Earl.
ED EARL
Thanks, Dulcie.
DULCIE MAE

We've finished serving lunch, but I

did save you a piece of meatloaf. It's
your favorite.

ED EARL
Well, no thank you. I have an
official report to make about all
this and I've got to go up to the
Chicken Ranch and talk to Miss Mona.

DULCIE MAE
Oh, of course.

ED EARL
Catch you later.

Ed Earl drives off to the cheers of the citizens. We push
in on Dulcie Mae's face. She knows he's going out to
celebrate with Mona and that he is in love with her.

MONA
Well, listen to that, it's my

I know. Why do you think I put it

He offers her his hand. She smiles and takes it. They walk

Look at them stars. Ain't nothin‘

Ain't that the truth.

Hey! Did you see that shooting star?

Mmmm .

MONA
Do you think that might have been a
spaceship? Do you believe in that
sort of thing?

ED EARL
Oh, sure. There's all kinds of
strange things happening. I seen
some pictures once of those little
guys from outer space. They're about
two feet high, have bald heads, tiny
little legs and they got no peckers.

MONA
well, then, I ain't interested and
neither would any of my girls. You
know, when I was little I used to
dream about flying saucers coming
down to get me and take me off to
heaven. You know, like the angels.
‘And I looked and behold a whirlwind
came out of the north...and out of
the midst of the fire came the
likeness of four living creatures.'

MONA
That was very Christian of you, Ed
Earl. :
ED EARL
well, we were all Baptists in my
family.

MONA
I never stayed with any one family
long enough to become anything in
particular. But I read the Bible
and I do know about Jesus.

ED EARL
I think Jesus was a nice person.
Must have been a good speaker.

MONA
You know, I knew a woman once who
told me she had a vision of Jesus.
He came right down and sat on the
end of her bed one night. I
believed her. I feel that could
happen to me.

ED EARL
Well, if Jesus comes into your
piace honey, all hell's gonna break
oose.

MONA

I guess you got a point, Ed Earl.
But you know, Jesus was very good
to Mary Magdalene and she was a
fallen woman. Isn't that amazing.
She was perhaps his best friend.

ED EARL .
You mean Mary Magdalene was Jesus'
girlfriend?
MONA

Well, not the way you're thinking.

ED EARL
Oh, he knows I was kidding. He

ED EARL
Well, it's one dream I believe I
could pull off. People like me.
It's natural to like me. You know,
people like you, too. You'd be
surprised if you took a poll around

MONA
Really?

ED EARL
I hear it all the time. You're a
well-liked lady.

MONA
Well, I always believed if you see

You must have wanted to be

MONA

MONA
I used to think I wanted to be a

One of the first things I can

Mona turns on the television and we see Melvin seated at the
news desk giving his version of what happened in the Gilbert
town square.

MELVIN
What happened to me, as an
individual, is not important.
But what Sheriff Dodd did to a
constitutionally licensed newsman
and a good tax-paying American
citizen is important! It calls up
old dark versions of Mussolini's
Brown Shirts and the Nazi terrors.
I think the film speaks for itself.

Aggies, now fully dressed with shirts and hats, charge out
of the front door.

Silhouetted against the setting sun, the Aggies are packed,

Jewel opens the door and welcomes them. They enter politely,

greets them when suddenly all heads turn to Miss Mona as she
makes one of her grand entrances down the stairs.

SENATOR

INT. CHICKEN RANCH COURTYARD - NIGHT 147

Miss Mona enters with the Aggies as the girls are coming
down the backstairs or waiting beneath the colored lanterns
strung out over the punch bowl. They are all wearing their
ball gowns and look slightly reminiscent of a high school
prom. The Aggies break into whistles and catcalls and begin
pairing off for an encore of the Aggie dance. Leroy spots
Shy and he pairs up with her. Mona signals Ginger to take
the Senator off her hands.

The high point of the number comes when the girls snap off
their bali gowns (held in place by Velcro) and appear in
their latest Frederick's of Hollywood underwear.

AGGIES
Yeeeehaaaaw!

The stomping becomes frenetic and the dance ends with the
couples facing off inside or upstairs looking for a bedroom.
The Senator goes with Ginger. Leroy goes off with Shy.
Mona looks over at Jewel, gives her a look that says "Well,
that's that," and turns off the party lights.

EXT. GILBERT TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

Deputy Fred is making his rounds, walking across the

Well, he's going to be real

Huh? Huh...Holy shit!

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - NIGHT , 155

Everyone has gone to bed. The lights are low. We pan down
from Mona at her desk in her bedroom to shadows creeping
along the Chicken Ranch wall. It is Melvin and his crew of
cameramen and reporters (eight in all). They reach the
lattice door to the backyard and, with a pair of chain
eutters, cut the lock. Melvin turns to the camera, signals
to switch it on and addresses his audience.

MELVIN .

MONA

JEWEL
It's that Melvin P. Thorpe sucker
and his TV reporters.

Mona runs back into her room while Jewel grabs a still photog-

The Senator looks stupidly about in the haloed light of the
powder-filled air. He sees the television camera and jumps
out of bed and runs into a closet, slamming the door behind

In the early morning light we discover Ed Earl, unshaven and

After a series of shots, he begins to sing.

ED EARL
Sometimes I get crazy
As fools are known to do
Lose my head in spite of
Everything I stand to lose
What is it in a man
That makes him act like
Such a fool
I swear I never knew
But always needed to.

Stubborn pride is just the way of stallions
I suppose

Even love can't change

The things I want to change the most

And it's pride that's got me standin'

When I should be on my knees

Making apologies

But it's so damn hard for me.

Oh, but now and again

I wish I'd a been a poet

So I could know the perfect lines
To say

Have some great romantic way

To show it

Be the hero ridin' up

To save the day.

And I'd go ridin' high

Like a knight in shining armor

Just sweep her up and race into the sun
But I don't have no magic ways

To charm her

No, it's lonely in the fields

Where stallions run.

And I'd like to say I love you
But those words just don't come
Words like that are no match
For the kind that rule my tongue
But I can only hope she knows

I love her anyway

No matter what I say

Oh, but I never say.

The Chicken Ranch? I think it's a
good idea. You take a lot of young
boys, they're going to be looking
for women. If they can't find 'em,
they'll rape ‘em, and if they don't
do that, they'll run to other women
and get diseases. Those girls went
to doctors.

closing the Chicken Ranch I want
you to know the facts.

GOVERNOR,
Well, I haven't made that decision

ED EARL
The Chicken Ranch, Governor, has
been in my county since before I
was born. Its doors have been open

“to soldiers and presidents and

farmers and even governors who can
remenb ex what a great institution
t is.

GOVERNOR
No need to bring that up, Sheriff.

-ED EARL
I'm not threatening you, Governor.
You hold the whiphand. Whatever
you say I'm going to do, but think
of the people out there. I've
known Miss Mona for twelve years
and there's no finer woman that
you'll ever meet. The town likes
her. She never refuses a charity

swimming pool. Hell, she even

confuse crime with committing a
gin. You can't legislate
morality. Those girls out there
have never caused any trouble. No
fights. No dope. No nothing.
They're healthy, tax-paying,
law-abiding citizens who supply a
demand and provide an economic
asset to the community.

GOVERNOR
Ed Earl, you ever thought of
running for office? You make that
whorehouse sound like a damn
non-profit recreational facility.

ED EARL
Governor, if the citizens who

‘elected me had found it necessary

to close it for any reason, I would
do it. I£ Miss Mona and her girls
were jeopardizing the health,
wealth or moral scruples of the
community, I would do it. If the
place had even been just a piddlin'
nuisance, an eyesore, or even a
fire hazard, I would close it
down. But there's nothing! No
reason, except the cries of this
muckraking sensationalist on
television.

INT. MONA'S CAR = DAY

Mona looks forward and sees Ed Earl with his hand raised and
a resolute look of authority on his face. Despite her
tears, she breaks into a smile.

EXT. CHICKEN RANCH - DAY - HELICOPTER SHOT

Jewel stops the car and we pull back as Ed Earl walks over
to Mona and opens her door. The Narrator begins singing and
as we swing around and fly higher we see the little house
all closed and shuttered sitting forlornly on top of the
hill.

NARRATOR
Oh, the little house lay ina
Green Texas glade
Where the trees were as coolin'
As fresh lemonade
Soft summer wind
Had a trace of perfume
And a fan was turnin'
In every room.

CHORUS
Twenty fane were turnin’
They were turnin'
Twenty fans were turnin’
In every room
Fevers were a-burnin'
They were burnin'
And they had to have
A way to cool down.

MONA'S VOICE
It was just a little old bitty
pissant country place....

FADE TO BLACK

END CREDITS

The music

flash short cuts of highlights from the film. At the end of
the credits, Mona turns to camera.

MONA
Ya'll come back now, you hear?
