We want to see you, Mr. Hammer.

What's the matter? Somebody pay

BOYS’
We want our money.

HAMMER
Yes -- money -- you want your money?

BOYS
We want to get paid.

HAMMER
Oh -- you want MY money? Is that
fair? Do I want your money? Suppose
George Washington's soldiers had
asked for money? Where would this
country be today?

BOYS
But they did ask.

And where's Washington? No, my

be a wise crack, but I doubt it.

Let's get together and we'll make

EDDIE
That's all very well, Mr. Hammer,
but we haven't been paid in two
weeks and we want our wages.

HAMMER
Wages? Do you want to be wage slaves?
Answer me that! .

Boys
No!

HAMMER

Of course not. Well, what makes
Wage slaves? Wages, I want you
to be free. Remember there's no~

and the Saturday Evening Post. Be
free, my friends. One for. all and

BEACH SCENE

BOB
Look, this is Cocoanut Manor. You
know that hill ---?

POLLY
What a question. Do I know that
cunning little hill?

BOB
It's cunning, all right. That's
why there hasn't been any develop-
ment here,

POLLY
Couldn't it be cut down?

BOB
No =- it's too expensive. Now,
here's what happened. John W.
Berryman was here to see it last
month. You know Berryman practi-
Cally made Palm Beach and Miami,
but he said he wouldn't touch this.
Now when a man like that passes a
place up, no one wants it, Do you
know anything about architecture?

POLLY
No, but I'd love to learn.

BOB
Well, I made a drawing of the whole
Place, showing it as a built up
scheme, without cutting down the
hill, or having it get in the way.
T made the hill fit in with the
architectural scheme, see? I sent
Berryman a copy last week, and his
Secretary wrote me a nice note
Saying they were studying my plans.

POLLY
That's thrilling! Does Mr. Hammer
know about it?

BOB
I did. But if he takes it, I will
design the buildings. Say, I may
be an architect yet.

POLLY
If he only does, I'm sure it will
be the most beautiful Place in the
world.

MOTHER
Why a daughter of mine should fool
around with a hotel clerk when she
has the opportunity of marrying
one of the Boston Yates -- is more
than I can understand.

POLLY
Oh, who cares, about the Boston Yates?
Anyway, Bob isn't a clerk; he's an
architect. He's only elerking until
he can get started.

MOTHER
One who clerks, Polly, 1s a clerk,
and that settles it. And I want
. you to remember that no Potter has
ever been involved in a single
scandal.

POLLY
How about Uncle Dick?

Polly, it's a well known fact that
your uncle was drunk at the time,

Do you know that property values
have increased since 1929 one
thousand per cent? Do you know

HAMMER
Take its climate -- no, we took
that -- take its fruits -- take
the alligator pears -- take all
the alligator pears and keep ‘em --

alligator pears are made?

MRS. POTTER
Haven't the slightest idea ---

HAMMER
There you are. That's because you've

That's not a reflection on you --
it's on the pants. What I meant
was if we had a nice bungalow and
I came home from work -- and you
standing by the gate -- no -- you'd
come home from work -~ and I was
standing by the gate, and we came
down the path and we went inside
and the shades were drawn and the
lights were low, and then -- are
you sure your husband's dead?

MRS. POTTER
Why, yes.

HAMMER
There seems to be a trace of un-
certainty in that "yes." You know
ayes like that was once responsible
for me jumping out of a window and
I'm not the Jumper I used to be.
What I meant was, you are going to
be here all winter and I'm stuck
with the hotel anyhow -~ why don't
you grab me until you can make
ather arrangements?

MRS. POTTER
My dear, Mr. Hammer, I shall never
get married before my daughter.
