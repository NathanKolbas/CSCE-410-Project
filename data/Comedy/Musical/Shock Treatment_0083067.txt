Rockwell paintings)}

{Back to studio.  Floor manager signals Betty.  Janet presses button.} 
 
BETTY: {her name appears on screen} {enthusiastically} Well how about 
that?  Wasn't that terrific?  And what about those shots of the new 
Leisure Center?  I for one can't wait for the opening tomorrow night -- 
But to return to our afternoon discussion with judge Oliver Wright -- 
Denton's leading social scientist. {She addresses him} Judge Wright? 
{We see his name appear at the bottom of the screen}  Do you feel that 
the film we've just seen is overly manipulative or a good thing? 
 
OLIVER: There are many ways that the spider may catch the fly... 
 
{Cut to control booth.  Janet pressing phone tabulator.  We see a bank 
of screens behind her with Betty and Olly on them.}{Oliver continues 
with "Monetary Inducements, Seduction, Prejudice".} 
 
JANET: Hello, Brad?  Listen, darling, I'm going to be a little 
late...well keep mine in the oven...of course I love you. 
 
OLIVER: {Background screens} Honeyed words... 
 
JANET: Look, I've got to go now. 
 
Sc. 2 BRAD AND JANET'S HOME 
 
{Brad is sitting and watching TV.  He has a drink in his hand, a 
cigarette.  Vacuum cleaner at his side and his feet up.  Olly on his 
screen says "Lies".  Brad puts the phone down. 
 
Sc. 3 TV STUDIO 
 
{We cut to Janet putting down the phone.  She looks at her colleague in 
the control booth -- Neely Pritt.  Neely raises her eyebrows in 
sympathy.} 
 
NEELY: Stand by for a commercial, Janet.  It's as close as we'll come to 
a successful man in this town. 
 
JANET: Right.  {She stabs at her desk.  The bank of TVs change to} 
{A commercial for Farley Flavors Fabulous Fast Food 5 F's}

Sc. 4 BRAD AND JANET'S 
 
{Cut to Brad switching off the TV.  Wanders into kitchen} 
 
Sc. 5 TV Studio 
 
{Cut to Betty and Olly walking off set} 
 
BETTY: Thanks you so much, Judge Wright, for a wonderful interview. 
 
OLLY: Judge Wright?  I /am/ retired and, besides Betty, you've known me 
long enough to call me Oliver. 
 
BETTY: Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. 
 
{We follow them through some swing doors and into a corridor} 
 
BETTY: Time for a coffee before you rush off? 
 
OLLY: Delighted, Betty --That is, if you don't mind being seen with an 
older man. 
 
BETTY: Why. Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I 
look for in a man-- 
 
{A door reading "Everett Scott -- Station Manager" opens and Neely comes 
out with some papers.  We see Janet inside with Scotty (in a 
wheelchair)} 
 
NEELY: {She smiles a cheesy smile at Betty} Hi Betty!  --That interview 
was so {searching for a word} probing. 
 
{Neely passes on -- Betty grits her teeth--} 
 
OLIVER: A free thinker 
 
BETTY: Everything's free there.  {They move on.} 
 
OLIVER:  Wasn't that Janet Majors I saw in Scott's office then?  Brad 
and Janet -- what an ideal couple -- 
 
{They reach the next office to Scotty's -- Betty opens the door} 
 
OLIVER: --More than anyone else in Denton, they represent the old values 
-- 
 
{They pass inside.  We see the shadows of Janet and Scotty through an 
opaque glass partition.} 
 
OLIVER:  Eisenhower would have been proud of them. 
 
SCOTTY (V/O):  Face up to it, Janet, he's an emotional cripple. 
 
{Oliver and Betty freeze and listen in.} 
 
JANET (V/O):  I know, I know, it's just... 
 
SCOTTY: I recommend, Janet, that you send Brad to the MacKinley's for 
treatment.  Cosmo and Nation MacKinley -- neuro-specialists par 
excellence.. 
 
{Oliver and Betty can't believe what they're hearing.} 
 
JANET:  Neuro-specialists -- that sounds pretty drastic. 
 
SCOTTY: It's no use pussy footing around, Janet -- We have to cut quick 
and deep. 
 
OLIVER: {As if he has heard the name before}  MacKinley...MacKinley... 
 
BETTY: {whispers} {to Oliver}  Perhaps you knew them back in Europe? 
 
OLIVER: {Thinking hard} Hmmmmmm. 
 
SCOTTY (V/O): There's no use delaying another moment.  I'll phone the 
MacKinleys immediately.  I'm afraid there's only one 
solution.../Dentonvale/! 
 
{Shocked looks from Olly and Betty} 
 
Sc. 6 Brad and Janet's 
 
{In the kitchen.  Brad;s in his apron and upset.} 
 
BRAD: I'm not going, Janet. 
 
JANET:  What are you trying to do?  Make Scotty look like a fool?  He's 
made all the arrangements. 
 
BRAD:  But I don't need treatment -- {He drops a cup} 
 
JANET:  That's the second one this week.  {She exits.} 
 
{Brad drops to his knees with a dust pan and brush and starts cleaning 
up the mess -- He comes face to face with the blender -- He sings.} 
        SONG 'Bitchin in the Kitchen' 
 
BRAD: Dear blender?  Oh won't you help a first offender 
        Oh toaster?  Don't you put the burn on me.. 
        Re-fridge-erator why are we always sooner or later 
         
        Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night. 
         
        Dear knife drawer, won't you help me to face life more.. 
        Oh trash can, don't you put the dirt on me 
        Oh perc-o-lator why are we always sooner or later.. 
 
        Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night. 
 
{Upstairs bedroom.  Janet is throwing things into a suitcase.  She 
sings.} 
 
JANET:  Everything used to be okay 
        But I've been had 
        And Brad I'm sad to say 
 
{Janet has crossed to the window.  Janet's POV of rather battered 
ambulance arriving,} 
 
JANET:  Is on his way. 
        Micro-digital awaker {holding radio/clock} 
        Why are we always sooner or later 
        Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night. 
 
{Bathroom.  Janet enters with bag -- collecting the odd toilet 
requisite.} 
 
JANET:  Shower curtain 
        Won't you help me to be certain 
        Oh toothpaste 
        Don't you put the squeeze on me 
 
{Janet brings bag downstairs in answer to doorbell} 
 
JANET:  Depilatator 
        Why are we always sooner or later 
        Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night. 
 
{Opens door.} 
 
MALE NURSE (RICKY):  I've come for Mr. Majors, Ma'am 
 
{Janet indicates kitchen and proceeds out door to throw bag in her car. 
A curious neighbour passes.  Brad is led to ambulance.} 
 
NEIGHBOUR:  Nothing serious I hope? 
 
{Neighbour looks as if she hopes that it's terminal} 
 
JANET:  No.  Just a routine check-up. 
 
{Neighbour looks put out.  Janet climbs in car.  Tears flow.  Engine 
starts. 
 
JANET:  Oh carburetor 
        Why are we always sooner or later 
        Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night. 
 
{Chorus repeats as they drive off down street.  As they turn the corner 
and drive out of frame a billboard is revealed reading "Denton: Home of 
Happiness".} 
 
Sc. 6A  TV Studio 
 
{Scotty is operating telex.  It reads "F.F -- H.Q. -- D.C. subject 
committed.  As am I."} 
 
Sc. 7 Dentonvale 
 
{Establishing shot of Dentonvale.  A sinister, imposing but rather 
decrepit mansion run by a European couple, the MacKinleys, as a 
sanitorium.  A 'For Sale' notice features on the exterior. 
 
Inside Nation MacKinley, a glamourous professional woman in her 
thirties, slings a few strait jackets into a cupboard.  Her brother, 
Cosmo, a strange nervy man, is pushing bills and 'Final Demand' notices 
into a drawer.} 
 
MAC:    Flowers!  We must have flowers! 
 
NATION: The garden's a mess... 
 
{She rushes out and we follow her.  Nation hurries out and drags some 
tired flowers out by the roots.  The ambulance and Janet arrive.  Nation 
notices the 'For Sale' sign behind her and rips it off to reveal a sign 
saying 'Dentonvale -- Sanity for Today'.  Janet Brad et al. bundle in 
and Nation, holding the 'For Sale' sign behind her back, waves and 
smiles professionally. 
 
Mac's office is totally transformed and looks chic and professional 
complete with two desks and nameplates.  Brad and Janet enter.} 
 
MAC:    Ah.  Mr. and Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I 
understand you're going through a rather trying time... 
 
BRAD:   Listen!  There's nothing wrong with me..it's just that Janet and 
I haven't... 
 
{Nation appears behind him and hypos him -- as he drops, she kicks a 
chair under him.} 
 
MAC:    {to Janet} Does he do this often? 
 
JANET:  {stunned, she doesn't know Nation hit him with the hypo} No! 
He's never done that before. 
 
MAC:    Good! Well there's still hope.  Lots of hope. 
 
NATION: {softly}  If anyone can help Brad.  We can.  {She presses 
buzzer} 
 
JANET:  Well, he needs help. 
 
MAC:    And he'll get it. 
 
{Nurse Ansalong enters with a wheelchair.} 
 
MAC:    Ah.  Nurse Ansalong -- you're here. 
 
ANSALONG:       Well it was pretty short notice but I... 
 
NATION: SEE Mr. Majors to his room Nurse. 
 
MAC:    There are just one or two formalities that have to be dealt 
with, Mrs. Majors.  The committal papers need to be signed... 
 
{But Ansalong has started to wheel Brad out -- Janet wants to follow. 
Nation grabs the papers and glances at them.} 
 
JANET:  Could I do that later? 
 
NATION: Of course. 
 
{Janet exits after Brad -- Mac grabs the papers back and chases after 
them.  Mac just catches up with them and blocks the doors with his hand. 
The papers are in it and not wishing to appear too eager he pretends he 
is indicating the door.} 
 
MAC:    This is the room.  {He throws open the door.  We track in.  It's 
pretty bleak.} 
 
MAC (V/O):      Dr. Nation MacKinley and I chose the soft furnishings. 
{During this, Ansalong has strapped Brad to the bed.  She leans in to 
Janet.} 
 
ANSALONG {sotto voce} Sign the papers tomorrow... 
 
JANET {looks at her questioningly}: Ah... 
 
ANSALONG {as Mac appears}: Sshh 
 
MAC {with papers}:  Just one or two details.  Does he have any living 
relatives?  Blood relatives? 
 
JANET:  No...couldn't I do this later? 
 
MAC:    Later? 
 
JANET:  Visiting hours? 
 
NATION: Of course. 
 
{She drags Mac out of the room.  Ansalong crosses to the door.} 
 
JANET {to Ansalong}:  Why did you tell me not to sign now? 
 
ANSALONG:  Well this way, you get the first day /FREE/. 
 
{She exits.} 
{Mac's office.  Scotty on phone to Janet's mother.} 
 
SCOTTY: A nervous breakdown...an emotional victim of our troubled 
times...I just wanted you to know that your daughter is coping.  About 
Brad?  Tell me, is there a history of mental...instability...in his 
family?  Oh...adopted...I see. 
 
{Mac and Nation enter.} 
 
        Yes, I'll keep in touch.  And don't worry /she'll/ be with you 
soon -- and /he's/ in good hands. 
{Puts phone down.} 
        Infantile regression. 
 
NATION {to Mac}:  Our speciality. 
 
{Back in Brad's room Janet is alone with her sedated husband.  She is 
worried.  She sings.} 
 
        SONG: "In My Own Way" 
 
JANET:  If only you knew  
        How to win some prizes 
        If only you knew how to play 
        If you could sleep nights  
        And stop your crying 
        You might find out I still love you 
        In my own way {Janet moves to door} 
        If that's not enough then I'm  
        So sorry I met you 
        It was almost like leading you on 
        But there's more to it all 
        Than just wringing your heart out 
        Over something that keeps on going wrong 
 
{During chorus Janet sails down corridor out of front door and into her 
car.  Scotty, Mac and Nation peer out behind blinds and curtains. 
Ansalong files her nails on the porch.} 
 
JANET:  So don't tell me you love me 
        How am I supposed to know what that means 
        No don't sell emotion 
        You can't buy devotion 
        By throwing despair on your dreams. 
 
Sc. 8 Streets of Denton 
 
{Janet is driving through Denton along rows of similar suburban houses. 
 
JANET:  I hope that you'll smile 
        When you reach your conclusion 
        I hope that you'll know just what to say 
        But if it should mean that the party is over 
        You should know that I still love you 
 
{Janet has arrived at her parents' place.  She pulls into drive and gets 
out.} 
 
JANET:  You should know that I still love you 
        You should know that I still love you 
        In my own way. 
 
{The door opens and we see Mom.  Music concludes under the following.} 
 
MOM:     Oh my poor baby. 
 
JANET:   Oh Mommy.  Brad's... 
{They hug} 
 
MOM:    I know Baby.  Scotty rang.  He's going to get the help he needs. 
 
{Cut to:} 
 
Sc. 9 Dentonvale 
 
{Scotty and Nation are watching a soap opera on TV.  Mac is in a state 
of agitation.} 
 
MAC:     It was so very good of you to find a patient for us, Doctor 
Scott.  {He pours a little drink} 
 
SCOTTY: Well I confess the decision to have Brad committed was not 
strictly my own. 
{Nation looks secretive} 
 
MAC:    Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet-- But I'm puzzled.  If she was 
so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the papers. 
 
SCOTTY: No it wasn't Janet --exactly--It was, in fact, your new 
landlord. 
 
MAC:    /LANDLORD/! ! ! 
 
SCOTTY:  Dentonvale has been sold. 
 
MAC:    /SOLD/ ? ? ! ! 
 
NATION:  Dear old Scotty's settled everything. 
 
SCOTTY: Jah -- You endorse his product -- He endorses your research. 
 
MAC:    /HE/ ! ! ? ?  How dare this person take advantage of my 
weakness. 
 
NATION {with a secret smile}: I don't think he means to go that far. 
 
Sc.10 Janet's Parents' Place 
{The screen is filled by a TV image of a boiling jug being switched off. 
We pull back from the TV set to reveal Janet's mom echoing the action 
with an identical electric jug.  Throughout this scene a soap opera will 
play on the TV which echoes what is happening in the room.  Mom is 
making coffee.  Janet is holding a rather inappropriate dress and some 
gift wrapping.} 
 
MOM {to Dad}:   Well I wanted Janet to have it. 
 
JANET:  It's very nice. 
 
MOM:    It's imported -- Taiwanese! 
 
DAD:    Damn it Ruby she's not interested. 
{TV V/O "You're not interested"} 
 
MOM:     What are you trying to do?  Start an argument?  Don't you want 
your daughter to look pretty? 
 
DAD:    Who's she got to look pretty for? 
{Janet looks stricken} 
 
MOM: {defending}: She's got a husband. 
 
DAD {attacking}: She's got a weirdo!  /I've/ never been able to afford 
the time for a 'nervous breakdown'. 
 
{TV V/O "They say it's a nervous breakdown"} 
 
MOM:    Thank God he was born an orphan.  It would have killed his 
parents.  And thank goodness he hasn't ended up like the Slepstrini boy. 
 
{TV V/O "Thank goodness"} 
 
DAD:  What are you talking about.  Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the 
old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week. 
And Hank says Danny' moved to New York.  {Pause}  To better himself. 
 
MOM:    He moved alright!  When they found him at the back of Wilson's 
bakery?  Naked?  With fifteen other men? 
 
{Dad's mouth starts opening and closing.} 
 
JANET {quietly}: Mexicans. 
 
{Dad makes for the door.} 
 
DAD:    I'm going to catch up on a few jobs that need doing outside. 
 
{He leaves.  Blushing scarlet.} 
 
MOM {to Janet}:  You shouldn't have said that. 
 
JANET:  Why? 
 
MOM:    Your father doesn't like Mexicans. 
 
{TV V/O "Ole'!"  As music starts, Dad enters from garage pushing a 
mower.  He mows around until the chorus when we see a vista of identical 
backyards with the occupants mowing.} 
        Song: "Thank God I'm a Man" 
 
DAD:    A man should call the toss...wear the pants and be the boss 
        A man should be the drake for his own damn sake. 
        And men should be the misters and masters of their sisters 
        And a man should be the reason for a heart to break 
 
        A man should cut the lawn.  Change a tyre.  Mend the worn 
        A man should never wait to oil a rusting gate 
        Men should hold the key positions in our country's great 
traditions 
 
        A man should put the food upon the family plate. 
 
NEIGHBOURS {all mowing in time}:  
        So be moral.  Don't quarrel.  Fair and square is best 
        Let me alert you...that virtue won't hurt you or desert you 
        If you wear hair on your chest. 
        So always remember to follow the rules...Box clever 
        ...And jocks never 
 
DAD:    Hock another jock's tools 
         
        A man should wax a car.  Fix a fuse and tend a bar 
        A man should like his brow to be wet with sweat... 
        Men should know the right occasions to indulge in tax evasions 
        A man should know the settings that his spark plugs get. 
 
        /Faggots are maggots...Thank god I'm a man/

Sc.11 Betty's place 
 
{Betty is in her 'singles' apartment.  She is on the phone to Oliver.} 
 
BETTY:  Oliver I would be glad to share a problem with you...Sure come 
on over... {Pause} /RALPH! !/  Not here he doesn't. {She looks at a 
photo of their wedding}  We're both being very adult about it.  After 
all, it /was/ a marriage of inconvenience.  He has his life, boring as 
it is and {seductively} I have mine...Eight o'clock's fine. 
 
{Cut to:} 
 
Sc. 12 Denton intersection. Evening 
 
{Janet is driving too fast.  We hear a siren.  It's the Denton traffic 
cop -- Officer Vance Parker.  He pulls her over, stops his car and 
walks back to Janet. 
 
VANCE:  Okay lady, what you got, lead in your shoe?  Oh it's you Janet. 
 
{He becomes what he believes to be charming.} 
        What are you trying to do, kill yourself? 
 
JANET:  I'm sorry, Officer Parker. 
 
VANCE {looks both ways}: Vance! 
 
JANET:  Oh?  It's just that Brad...is not...very well and...{tears} I 
didn't want to miss visiting hour at Dentonvale. 
 
VANCE:  Dentonvale...say, that's for...{he goes to tap his head and 
turns it into a scratch}  I'm sorry to hear that Janet.  {He is secretly 
pleased but can't show it}  Look I'm going to let you go.  But drive 
carefully, otherwise, well, I'll have to book you... 
 
JANET:  Thanks Officer Par...Vance. 
 
VANCE:  Don't worry Janet.  Brad's probably feeling better already.

Sc. 13 Betty's place.  Night. 
 
{Oliver arrives.  Betty meets him at the door brandishing a fistful of 
dollars.}  
 
BETTY {screaming at Ralph}: Alimony is just another word for rape! 
{opens door}  Oh Oliver!  Come in.  Look who's here! 
 
{We see Ralph -- Betty's estranged husband.} 
 
OLIVER: Oh--good evening, Ralph.  I'm not calling at an inconvenient 
moment am I? 
 
RALPH:  No--not at all Judge Wright.  I've got to get back to the 
Leisure Center.  We've got the big day tomorrow.  Our benefactor, Mr. 
Flavors, is jetting in for the opening and well...Farley expects! 
 
OLIVER: Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  It's remarkable that the indigestion 
of an entire nation could build such a handsome edifice. 
 
RALPH {put out}: Well, I'll leave you /young/ things to it. 
 
BETTY {opening door} {whispers}  Shove it, Ralph! 
 
RALPH {at door} {whispers back}: You too, Betty! 
 
{Door slams.  Betty turns it on for Olly.  She crosses to the record 
shelf.} 
 
BETTY:   Care for a quick cantata? 
 
Sc. 14 Dentonvale.  Night 
 
{Brad's room. 
 
Ricky opens door and Ansalong brings in the dinner tray.  She unstraps 
the restrained Brad and serves him his meal.  She lifts the cover off 
the dish revealing something unwholesome.  Ansalong makes to go.  She 
pauses at the door.} 
 
ANSALONG: You're really lucky.  You had today for free. 
 
{She leaves.} 
 
{Janet's car pulls into the Dentonvale drive.  A light glows from the 
dining room and balcony above giving a sinister feeling to the building. 
Upstairs Mac, Nation and Scotty are finishing dinner.  Ansalong clears 
the table.} 
 
SCOTTY: An excellent repast.  I must have the recipe... 
 
NATION: That's praise indeed from /you/, Scotty.  But, no secrets... 
 
MAC {resisting bonhomie}: With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV 
dinners from now on. 
 
SCOTTY: Farley is already onto a TV winner--he authorised me to purchase 
the controlling interest in our local TV station --in my name--just as 
Dentonvale will remain in yours--now that his interest has embraced 
mental hygiene. 
 
NATION {as if to enthuse Mac}: Our field. 
 
MAC {unenthused}: What does he know about it? 
 
SCOTTY: Who do you think gave you Brad? 
 
{He throws down a file marked "Denton Dossier" "Eyes Only".  Mac and 
Nation look a little astonished.} 
 
SCOTTY {continues}: So that Janet would be free to spearhead his mental 
hygiene campaign. 
 
{Mac holds the file and we see page one headed "Brad Majors" -- Page 2. 
"Janet Majors" -- page 3 a newspaper cutting reads "Twins Tragedy".} 
 
MAC:    We're the experts. 
 
{Scotty grabs the file possessively.} 
 
SCOTTY:  Who trusts experts? 
 
NATION:  How did you come by this dossier? 
 
SCOTTY:  A Washington Contact. 
 
MAC:     What's your angle? 
 
SCOTTY: I was Janet's employer--and amenable to Farley's plans. 
 
NATION: Why Janet? 
 
SCOTTY: Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley. 
 
NATION: So it seems. 
 
{Doorbell. 
Janet impatient at the front door.  Ricky opens it suspiciously.} 
 
RICKY:  Visiting hours are over. 
 
{Shuts door. 
Janet rings again.  A messenger with a parcel arrives.} 
 
MESSENGER: Having trouble lady? 
 
{Door re-opens} 
 
RICKY:  I told you visiting hours are... 
 
{The messenger grabs Ricky and slams him against the door} 
 
MESSENGER: Sign here! 
 
{Janet takes advantage of the situation and pushes past. 
 
Back in the dining room.  The trio wait.  The door flies open.} 
 
MAC & NATION: Janet ! ! 
 
JANET:  I've come to see Brad. 
 
NATION:  That's out of the question, he's sleeping like a baby. 
 
{We hear a distant scream.  Mac and Nation commence a quick 
interrogation to unnerve Janet.} 
 
MAC:    It's you we're concerned about, Janet. 
 
NATION: Yes how are /you/, Janet?  Are you happy? 
 
JANET:  I'm -- happy. 
 
MAC:    There are countless people in this world who believe they're 
happy. 
 
NATION: But they only /think/ they're happy. 
 
JANET:  That doesn't make sense. 
 
MAC:    Precisely. 
 
{The door opens.  Ansalong appears with the package and throws it at 
Mac.} 
 
ANSALONG: Fresh off the doorstep. 
 
MAC:    First of the TV dinners, no doubt. 
 
{He tears off the wrapper.  The parcel reveals a videotape.} 
 
SCOTTY: Ah!  the M.O. from F.F.  This might interest you Janet. 
 
{Mac crosses to the cassette deck} 
 
NATION: Lucky we kept the system back from the garage sale. 
 
{Mac presses play button} 
 
SCOTTY: We have lift off. 
 
{Video flickers to life with a glamorous 'movie star' image of Farley 
Flavors.  Suave in tuxedo and matching eyepatch, a carnation glistens in 
his lapel.  He looks uncannily like a sophisticated fast-talking version 
of Brad.} 
 
FARLEY {V/O}: A big Denton welcome to my new delegation.   
        This is Farley--I'm here with the score.   
        We're gonna package and sell some mental health to the nation 
        With my dream of the girl next door.

Sc. 15 Farley's Song 
 
FARLEY {sings}:  
        Oh why aren't they doing tomorrow's new dance step 
        The way they used to yesterday? 
        And who draws a perfect circle anymore? 
        If you're waiting for greatness to shake hands with you 
        You'd better daydream your life away 
        I've only wanted one thing and that's for sure. 
 
{Farley appears singing and dancing up a storm down the aisles of his 
fast food factory, ethnic employees dance amongst burgers hot dogs etc.} 
 
        You're not just looking at a fast food kind 
        Just another well known face 
        You're not looking at the king of anything 
        I'm gonna shoot for the moon 
        And play high noon 
        I'm gonna take on the entire human race 
        You're not looking at a king 
        You're looking at an ace. 
 
{Farley next appears in a romantic forest glade setting.  Sunlight 
glancing trees, water rippling.  Farley could be penning some verse and 
meditating.} 
 
        Oooh I got sight an' I've seen the light  
        An' I'm gonna see the comin' day 
        When the sun in the sky is a spotlight just for me 
        I'm gonna take my time an' rock some rhyme 
        That's gonna take your breath away 
        I'll be the front page rage of the age just wait an' see 
 
{During this we see Janet's enthusiastic reactions.  Next is a montage 
of "Successful Farley" flashed at social gatherings, giving speeches, 
meeting presidents, etc.  Montage accelerates with chorus.} 
 
        You're not just looking at a fast food kind 
        Just another well known face 
        Etc. to... 
        You're looking at an ace. 
 
{Last line repeats as Farley seems to step out of screen and take Janet 
in his arms ending in a clinch that vanishes with the last chord.} 
 
NATION {to Janet}: I just love home movies, don't you? 
 
{Janet is transfixed by the image of Farley 
Final V/O over Farley's frozen image.} 
 
FARLEY {V/O}: Time's tight, Janet

MAC:     We're going to put psychiatry within the reach of every family 
in this great nation of ours. 
 
JANET:   I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad. 
 
NATION:  The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he 
hates you. 
 
JANET {horrified}: What do you mean? 
 
MAC {softer approach}: Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you. 
 
JANET:   Me? 
 
MAC:    It's classical.  Almost a textbook case... 
 
{Janet cries} 
 
MAC:    That's an extremely negative response. 
 
SCOTTY: Jah, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad. 
 
JANET {through tears}: Is it because I'm too successful? 
 
MAC:    On the contrary.  He /wants/ to see you play the fame game.  He 
/needs/ a woman of exceptional desirability. 
 
NATION: So you see, Janet, you can help us to help him.

Center tomorrow night--The day beginning with your on-camera Breakfast 
Show Special, Janet.  Right, Beauty Sleep--we've got an early start. 
 
JANET:  Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home? 
 
SCOTTY: Go home? 
 
NATION: This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay 
here tonight.  {Rings buzzer}  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun 
paints us a new day with his golden brush. 
 
MAC:    And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning. 
 
{Ansalong appears}

OLIVER: Clever of you to find this spot, Betty. 
 
BETTY:   It pays to know your way around, Oliver.  Look, there's the 
Leisure Center. 
 
{We see a dark domed shape with a neon reading "Farley Flavors Leisure 
Center"} 
 
OLLY {quoting 'Kublai Khan'}: A "stately pleasure dome" indeed. 
 
BETTY:   Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.

dressing gown.  He just gets level with her door when he stop and looks 
around and furtively leans in towards the keyhole.  The door opens and 
hits him on the head.  Janet steps out with towels etc.  She's heading 
for the showers. 
 
JANET:  When do I get to see Brad? 
 
SCOTTY: After breakfast.  You're looking a little tense, Janet.

SCOTTY {to door}: Maybe I could give you a little massage.  My hands are 
famous.

SCOTTY {shouts}: In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin. 
 
{Door slams} 
 
{The kitchen at Dentonvale.  Nation preparing breakfast.  She closes 
door on eye-leve grill and steps into another room.  Scotty 
enters--sniffs the air--wheels across to the oven, sniffs again--looks 
furtively around--presumes he is alone and stands up to look through 
oven window--suddenly we are aware that Nation is behind him.}

Berlin.

rubber sheet}

MAC:    I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started 
thinking of yourself. 
 
{He leaps up and pushes her towards a mirror} 
 
MAC:    Look at yourself.  You're beautiful.  More beautiful than any 
film star, and I should know.  In the old days we had them at the clinic 
all the time... 
 
JANET:   Is it true they're all midgets with big heads? 
 
MAC:    Absolutely.  Compared to them, you are perfection, flawless 
beauty. {She blooms} You are the most desirable creature that ever 
walked. 
 
JANET:   If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say those 
things to me. 
 
MAC:     He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've 
got to /be/ fabulous.  /Say/ fabulous things.  /Wear/ fabulous clothes. 
/Do/ fabulous deeds.  And Farley's give you that chance--starting right 
now--you can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.

        An overall tux or frock 
        Each of them has brought me happiness

DAD:    No.  No I don't.  He doesn't have to be trussed up like a

the erection of her picture and her name in plexiglass.  Janet hurries 
to a door at the other end of the room.  It's a pass door into another 
suite, one which is being prepared for Farley Flavors.  There's a bar, 
from which she pours herself a large drink.  There are some clothes laid 
out, from which she selects a fedora, dark glasses and a black top coat.

Janet is behaving like a small child.  Mac is seething.  Glish and Oscar 
wit mesmerised; like most people they are mistaking histrionics for 
greatness.  Macy Struthers and Nation drag Janet from the shower and 
help her into a chair.  Oscar pushes coffee toward her.  Nation starts 
to dry Janet's hair.  Macy crosses to the door looking at her watch and 
showing signs of nervousness.} 
 
JANET: {murmurs} Brad!  Oh, Brad.

Well, I just got word Farley's landing any minute.  You guys!!  {Oscar 
and Glish}  Get yer asses down on that stage and try and earn yourselves 
a reputation.  Okay?  *Move*!!!

the table}

to keep you going here in Denton tonight...and naturally, feeling the 
excitement and not wishing to stick out like a sore thumb I had to get 
an outfit of my own together...an' this is it...

Harding... Cosmo and Nation Coolidge... Cosmo and Nation Fillmore... 
Oliver sighs with satisfaction...

slowly turns the tumbler lock...Then with the quickness of a much 
younger man he throws the door open and grabs the person on the other 
side...It's Ricky!  He's terrified by Oliver's commando outfit.} 
 
OLIVER: Well, well!  An accessory before and after the fact if ever I 
saw one.

NEELY:  We've heard rumours that you're going to unveil more than just 
the Leisure Center tonight.  Is this true?

FARLEY: Let's just say that I'm putting Sanity back on the menu of this 
great Nation of ours.

Innocence, decency and the illusion of a happy ending. 
 
MACY: {stepping though door} I'll go get her.

will thrive in the capable hands of two great ethical intellects 
operating on the frontiers of medical science {indicating Mac and 
Nation} ... coupled with the managerial genius of... {Scotty mouths 
"Ralph"} Ralph.  All under the firm guidance of a great survivor in the

officially open, we are taking the first step of defiance and starting 
something that will grow so big that the whole world will reverberate to 
its sound.  And wherever our slogan 'SANITY AND VANITY' is uttered it

        Always treading on the toes of the great 
        Generally spreading your weight 
        You're a spiteful, hateful asinine creature
