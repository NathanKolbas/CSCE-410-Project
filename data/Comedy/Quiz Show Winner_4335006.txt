FOR EDUCATIONAL
PURPOSES ONLY
INT. DAY. MERCEDES SHOWROOM - -MANHATTAN,

The luscious curves of a 1956 MERCEDES 190 coupe, lacquered red,
dripping with bright showroom light. Circling: ™

DICK GOODWIN, late 20s, a broad Boston accent, his braing worn
on his sleeve. Flush with youth and American confidence. He
chews a cigar as fat as a baby’s arm.

A SALESMAN circles mosquito-like.

GOODWIN
What is this, the 190?

SALESMAN
That’s 17 coats of paint,
hand-sanded. Seven coats of
lacquer.

Goodwin leans over. Looks at the sticker price. Sighs. Leans

back. Whistles low, drinks it in. ‘All this can be yours’...
SALESMAN

It takes a real individualist to

drive a car like this. Just out

of school?

GOODWIN
Harvard Law. Couple of years.
First in my class.

SALESMAN
-That degree’sells itself.
GOODWIN
I've been working for the
government.
SALESMAN
{disappointed)
Oh.
GOODWIN

Not that it’s permanent.

SALESMAN
(interested again)
Would you like to get behind the
wheel, Mr. Goodman?

GOODWIN
Goodwin.

SALESMAN
Just be careful with the cigar.

(CONTINUED)
1 CONTINUED:

The Salesman opens the door. Ushers Goodwin into the car.

. GOODWIN
I just think there's something
wrong about working so you can
drive a car.

SALESMAN
Release the clutch, if you
wouldn’t mind.

GOODWIN
You drive a car so that you can
work. You don’t work so that you
can drive a car.

The Salesman leans over and starts the IGNITION.

SALESMAN
Listen to,that. That’s a v8.
{off gauges)
You'll note it redlines at 3000
RPM.

GOODWIN
My father to this day has never
owned a car. I don’t even think
he has a driver’s license.

SALESMAN
That’s the American Dream.
{resuming)
I see you're admiring the
dashboard--that’s burled walnut.

GOODWIN
Is this what life has to offer?

SALESMAN
Pretty much. (thinks) This or the
Porsche, (resuming) The seats are
Florentine glove leather.

GOODWIN
The nicest piece of furniture 1
own will be in the garage.

SALESMAN
I’m going to get some paperwork,
just so you can see it’s more
affordable than you think.
(gestures to radio)
Try the radio.

SALESMAN (Cont‘d)
The only thing that sounds better
than the engine is the radio.

The Salesman EXITS. Goodwin turns on the radio. It emits a
repetitive BEEP. He listens thoughtfully.
RADIO NEWSMAN (0.C.)

The Russians have beaten us into
outer space. You are listening
to the sound of Sputnik, a
satellite launched this morning
via rocket, in orbit right now
directly over our heads...A sound
that says...

The Salesman returns, leans in. LISTENS.

RADIO NEWSMAN (0.C.)
++-all is not well with America.

SALESMAN
America doesn’t own a Mercedes.

CLICK! He pushes a button on the radio. Changes the station to
MUSIC that carries over into...

The door of a BANK VAULT opens...

INT. EVENING. BANK VAULT.

Flashbulbs BURST as two BANK V.P.s insert separate keys into a
safe-deposit box. Pull out a BOX embossed with the title

"24"
The V.P.s’ heels click smartly on the marble. REPORTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS follow them out to the street. A thick crowd of
the curious. The V.P.s climb into an ARMORED CAR.

POLICE CHERRYTOPS

Good evening, I'm Jack Barry.

CUT TO:

anticipation. Ponderous CAMERAS circle a podium that bears the

BARRY
Due to a series of ties, Herbert
Stempel, our 41 year old ex-GI
college student, must Play at
$3,000 a point, which means that
in a few brief minutes he can
either win over $100,000--the most
money won on television to
date--or lose everything he's won
in the last eight weeks.

LISTENING BACKSTAGE

The champ: HERBIE STEMPEL, Herbert the Great, early 40s and
overweight. Marine haircut and shabby suit. A Job for his

generation--exiled to the Boroughs, flayed by grey-flannel
insults, scourged by lowly status, grudge-laden before God.

The CHALLENGER watches as Herbie compulsively cleans his
glasses. .

CHALLENGER
Nervous?

HERBIE
Heh. It’s only money.

BACK ON- - BARRY

as the Bank V.P.‘s deliver the questions, head offstage.

“BARRY
Thank you, gentlemen.
{to audience)
So right now, let’s meet our first
two players, as Geritol, America’s
Number One tonic, presents ‘21°.

Two ESCORTS bring Herbie and the Challenger to the podium.

IN THE CONTROL ROOM

The producers, DAN ENRIGHT and ALBERT FREEDMAN. Enright has the
soul of a shoplifter surprised to find himself in Tiffany’s.

Freedman is his willing right arm--until a better shoulder comes
along.

Enright snaps a SWITCH. An APPLAUSE SIGN ignites the audience...

Mr. Barry, for asking.

Barry launches into the rules.

BARRY
As you know, Herb, the questions,

CUT TO:

INT. NIGHT. APARTMENT - -GREENWICH VILLAGE.

The buzz of genteel conversation. Tweeds and sherry. A BOOK
PARTY in honor of THE PROFESSOR, MARK VAN DOREN, late 50s, a
white-haired gent with a beatific demeanor, and his brisk,
articulate wife DOROTHY, late 50s also. Stacks of their new
BOOKS nearby. They greet a stream of GUESTS.

THE PROFESSOR
{to Dorothy)
Mother, where’s Charlie?

ALONE IN THE DEN

Hand on chin, MESMERIZED, the blue light of a TELEVISION Playing
on his chiselled features:

CHARLES VAN DOREN, 30s, handsome, well-born, debonair,
self-deprecating, perfect. The lithe build of a man who has
never been made to run uphill. An endearing blankness--the
boyish availability of a man still in search of himself.

A pretty YOUNG WOMAN, early 20s, approaches. Ignored by Charlie,
she tries to start conversation.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

- YOUNG WOMAN
Do you know Professor Van Doren?

CHARLIE
Oh--how rude of me. (introducing
himself) I’m Charlie.
(beat)
He’s my father.

YOUNG WOMAN
I took his course at
Columbia--‘Hawthorne, Original
Sin and the American
Experience’--well, as silly as
it sounds, it changed my life.

CHARLIE
Was it the Hawthorne or the sin?

- YOUNG WOMAN
To be the son of that
extraordinary man!

CHARLIE
When you said that, ‘Professor
Van Doren‘ --you know, I'm also
Professor Van Doren.

YOUNG WOMAN
Mathematics? You seem like the
-Mathematical type.

CHARLIE
Oh, no. Literature. Same as Dad.
YOUNG WOMAN

Really? Where do you teach?

CHARLIE
Columbia.

Goodwin sits on a couch--a waiting room outside the office of
the President of NBC. A huge NBC PEACOCK over his head.

A MONITOR

‘Goodwin gets up; crosses in front of the ‘Image.

BARRY (0.C.)
The first category is the American
Revolution.

A SECRETARY sits at a desk nearby. Goodwin approaches her.

GOODWIN
Do you think he might see me
before the peacock molts?

SECRETARY
Mr. Kintner apologizes, but he’s
unavailable. Why don’t you come
back tomorrow?.

GOODWIN
I’m sure he'd be available if my
name were Geritol.

SECRETARY
Who were you with again?

(CONTINUED)

GOODWIN
The United States
Congress --perhaps you've heard
of them. I spoke to Mr. Kintner
personally six weeks ago.

SECRETARY
The President of NBC never speaks
personally with anyone.

GOODWIN
The committee oversees television,
Kintner makes his speech about
television being a public trust
and I take notes. It’s simply a
matter of routine.

SECRETARY
Isn‘t everything?

Goodwin moves away, DEFEATED. The Secretary returns to her work.
Goodwin returns, nods toward the monitor.

GOODWIN
They do that show right here?

SECRETARY

questions have been certified and
graded for difficulty by the
Encylopedia Britannica on a scale
from one to. 11--11 being the
hardest question.

were hung in the Old North Church?
Who rode with Paul Revere? Who
lent him his horse? Was it a mare
Or a stallion? And what was the
horse’s name?!

What a question! An audible GASP from the audience. Herbie
grimaces, hugs his elbows, bites his lip, scratches his head
looks skyward for divine inspiration. :

HERBIE
Would you mind, Mr. Barry- -could
I take the third part last?

CUT TO:

INT. SAME TIME. SPONSOR‘’S HOME.

CHARLIE (Cont‘d)
And I was really quite good, but
when the day was done, no
Horowitz. So I decided to be an
actor. Or a philosopher--I studied
the Great Books at St. John's.
I realized I'd never really excel
at either of those, so I turned
to astrophysics. But of course
all the great physicists made
their discoveries before the age
of 25. That just wasn’t in the
cards. So I went to the West Bank
and wrote a novel, about a
parricide--

FREEDMAN
Excuse me?

-CHARLIE |
A boy who kills his father. My
Dad liked it quite a lot,
actually. But it’s not like he
equated it to Hawthorne or
anything. It just seemed--do you
know that Johnson remark, ‘the
epidemical conspiracy for the
destruction of paper’? I mean,
you could fill Yankee Stadium with
all the mediocre novelists in the

. world, and--

ENRIGHT
Could I ask you a personal
question? How much do they pay
you up at Columbia?

CHARLIE
Eighty-six dollars a week.

ENRIGHT
Do you know how much the average
stockbroker is paid? Do you have
any idea what Bozo the Clown

makes?

Well, we can’t all be Bozo the
Clown.

I have to admit, Mr. Enright, it’s
a national problem.

Jewish guy with a sidewall
haircut?

CHARLIE
I wanted to he Joe DiMaggio.

FREEDMAN
Especially after he held out for
the hundred grand.

ENRIGHT
That’s what this country needs.
An intellectual Joe DiMaggio, with
the money and the women and all
from this (tapping his head)
instead of a bat and ball.

CHARLIE
All that aside--well, honestly,
I_don‘t think I can beat him.
‘Tic Tac Dough’ seemed more
feasible.

Enright thinks a beat. Gazes out the window.

ENRIGHT
What if we were to put you on the
show--put you on ‘21’ this
Wednesday--and ask you “questions
you know? Say, the questions you
already answered correctly on your
test this morning?

CHARLIE
What do you mean? r thought the
questions were in a bank vault.

ENRIGHT
Forget about that. I’m just
thinking out loud.

beat him honestly.

we'd be giving you the answers,

CHARLIE,

FREEDMAN
We ask you a question, you know
the answer. Just because we know
you know, you still know.

ENRIGHT
It’s not like putting me on the
show, or Al, and pretending I’m
some intellectual. You've put in
the time, years of study and
erudition.

“CHARLIE
(wondering)
I’m just trying to imagine, what
would Kant think of this?

FREEDMAN
I really don’t think he'd have
a problem with it.

ENRIGHT
Nobody would ever have to know.
Just .us three. Think of what you'd
accomplish for the cause of
education.

CHARLIE
It just doesn’t seem right. I'd
have to say no.

it. You think they’d give me the
answers, who didn’t even need the
answers, and not give the Big Goy
the answers ?

GOODWIN
They gave you the answers?

SURPRISED, Toby shoots him a look--this is the first she’s heard
of it. An awkward PAUSE, filled with the sound of Lester‘s
drumming...

HERBIE
Would you please go inside and
tell Gene Krupa to take five?

Toby gets up, goes inside. Herbie resumes.

GOODWIN
Herb--why would you admit that
they gave.you the answers?

HERBIE
Exactly. Exactly. That‘s the
difference between me and Charles
Van Doren--I admit it. I have
my morality.

GOODWIN
I want te get this straight--they
made you take a dive after giving
you the answers.

HERBIE
I just wanted the money--frankly,
to get out from under the
financial thumb, as it were, of
my in-laws. I didn’t put myself

What else did you do that you
didn’t ‘mention’?

HERBIE
What, are you gonna start on me,

Mr. Enright, Herbert Stempel
swears the show is rigged.

It would take a real individualist
to believe Herb Stempel. Does he
have any concrete evidence? Does
it make any sense that a man would
implicate himself like this?

GOODWIN
Well, I’ve only just--

ENRIGHT
It’s not even logical. Do you know
how the show works? If I made him
take a dive, I'd have to give the
answers to Charles Van Doren.

feel responsible.

GOODWIN
Five sessions a week?

ENRIGHT
Well, it’s not so bad that he
needs to be institutionalized...

Enright ushers Goodwin to the door.

ENRIGHT
My theory, Dick, is that Herb is
so angry with himself for losing,
so guilt-ridden, that he has
projected that enormous guilt onto
the person of Charles Van
Doren--blames him for his
- downfall. Whereas the real
~-downfall of: Herbert: Stempel has

Freedman dismisses this with a masturbating gesture.

CHARLIE
Will you please stop that?

ENRIGHT
Charlie, you have to look at this
analytically. We know he's spoken
to Stempel. At best he’s found
another contestant who’s told him
a similar story.

CHARLIE
How many people did you give the
answers to?

HERBIE

Wednesday. We‘d have a sort of
rehearsal on Wednesday afternoon.

CONGRESSMAN #1
A rehearsal?

HERBIE
There was a great deal of .
histrionics involved, for the show
to proceed the way Mr. Enright
planned it.

CONGRESSMAN #1
Mr. Stempel, what do you mean by
*rehearsal’?

HERBIE
Well, for example, he told me how
to breathe heavily into the
microphone, and sigh, such as
this. (Herbie sighs) He taught
me how to stutter and say, in a
plaintive voice, ‘I will take
nine, nine points’.

CHAIRMAN
So it was all choreographed.

HERBIE
How to bite my lip. How to mop
my brow--he told me specifically
not to smear my brow, but rather
to pat for optimum effect. of
course I'm shvitzing the whole
time because they turned off the
air conditioning.

received the answers?

HERBIE
Of course he got the answers!

Look at him. You see? With the

CONGRESSMAN #3
Mr. Stempel, do you have any
direct knowledge that Charles Van
Doren received the answers?

Goodwin tries to signal Herbie. But Herbie’s intent on the
kinescope...

HERBIE
What? No, I mean--look at him!
It's the same thing!

already knew I knew the answers
to. Well, we ran through those

in five weeks. I still didn't
want them to actually give me the
answers. So I had them give me
the questions. And I’d go look

up the answers. Well, I didn’t
have the time, and finally, it
just seemed silly. So--
