INT. MADAME DE MERTEUIL'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

The gilt frame around the mirror on the MARQUISE DE
MERTEUIL's dressing-table encloses the reflection of
her beautiful face. For a moment she examines herself;
critically, but not without satisfaction. Then she
begins to apply her make-up.

ANOTHER ANGLE shows the whole large room, the early :
afternoon light filtering through gauze curtains. MERTEUIL's
CHAMBERMAID stands behind her, polishing her shoulders with
crushed mother-of-pearl. Three or four other female SERVANTS
wait, disposed around the room. It's midsummer in Paris in
1788.

INT. VICOMTE DE VALMONT'S BEDROOM DAY

VALMONT is an indistinct shape in his vast bed. His valet-
de-chambre, AZOLAN leads a troupe of male SERVANTS into the
room. One raises the blind and opens enough of a curtain
to admit some afternoon light, another waits with a cup of
chocolate steaming on a tray, a third carries a damp flannel
in a bowl. As VALMONT stirs, his face still unseen, AZOLAN
takes the flannel, leans over and begins a perfunctory dry
wash.

INT. MERTEUIL'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

A steel hook moves to and fro, deftly tightening MME DE
MERTEUIL's corset.

INT. VALMONT'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

VALMONT's face is swathed in hot towels, his head tilted back.
A young MANICURIST, on his knees, attends to VALMONT's nails.
Several other SERVANTS wait gravely to play their part in the
elaborate ritual of dressing VALMONT. The BARBER produces

a pair of tweezers and delicately plucks a hair from one of
VALMONT's nostrils.

INT. MERTEUIL'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

A second dressing-table is covered with extravagant numbers of
perfume boxes. MERTEUIL, now in corset, chemise and underskirt
sits, surrounded by her MAIDS. Eventually she makes a choice

and indicates a box. A MAID opens the box and begins to
apply the perfume (in the form of a cream) to MERTEUIL's neck,
lightly massaging it in. Meanwhile, MERTEUIL smells the
contents of another box and hands it to a second MAID, who
begins applying it to MERTEUIL's armpit.

INT. VALMONT'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

AZOLAN opens a walk-in closet, which contains innumerable rows
of boots and shoes. He and another SERVANT choose a couple of
pairs of shoes each and bring them out. VALMONT's hand comes
INTO SHOT, indicating a black pair with red heels. AZOLAN
hands them to a BOOTBOY, who hurries away, breathing on them
as he goes.

INT. MERTEUIL'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

MERTEUIL'S MAID makes a final adjustment to the bamboo side
panniers hanging from MERTEUIL's waist, then motions two other
MAIDS to cover them with an embroidered petticoat.

INT. ANTE-ROOM TO VALMONT'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

VALMONT's PERRUQUIER waits attentively as VALMONT, seen
from behind, stands in front of the three tiers of featureless
wooden heads which carry his collection of wigs. Eventually,
he points to one.

INT. MERTEUIL'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

MERTEUIL's stomacher is now in position and she stands, arms
outstretched, as two MAIDS move forward with her dress, guidin
her arms into it as if it were an overcoat. This done,
MERTEUIL's SEAMSTRESS approaches and begins the delicate
process of sewing her into her dress.

INT. ANTE-ROOM TO VALMONT'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

A bizarre metal cone with gauze-covered eyeholes conceals
VALMONT's face as the PERRUQUIER blows powder at his wig. As
the powder drifts away, VALMONT slowly lowers the cone and

we see for the first time his intelligent and malicious
features.

ANOTHER ANGLE shows the complete magnificent ensemble; or
not quite complete, for AZOLAN now reaches his arms round
VALMONT's waist to strap on his sword.

INT. GRAND SALON IN MME DE MERTEUIL'S TOWN-HOUSE DUSK

A panoramic view of the great room. In one corner MERTEUIL
is playing piquet with her cousin MME DE VOLANGES; in the

centre of the room, the huge chandelier has been lowered to
within a foot of the floor and two FOOTMEN with tapers are

lighting its candles; and at the window itself is a demure
15-year-old blonde: CECILE VOLANGES.

The CAMERA closes in on her, as ON SOUND we hear the arrival
of a carriage, clattering into the paved courtyard below.

EXT. COURTYARD DUSK

CECILE'S P.O.V.: below, the handsome black carriage

comes to a halt. The FOOTMAN clinging to the back jumps
down, runs back, opens the door, lowers the step and stands
back. Presently the VICOMTE DE VALMONT emerges, resplendent.

INT. GRAND SALON DUSK
CLOSE ON CECILE, as she looks down at VALMONT, curious.

The chandelier is fully lit now and one of the FOOTMEN
begins to raise it.

MME DE MERTEUIL's perfect, mask-like face gradually becomes
fully-lit as the chandelier rises. She's looking not at

her cards but across the long expanse of the room at CECILE's
profile. Eventually she speaks.

MERTEUIL
Well, my dear...

CECILE doesn't at first realise it's she who's being
addressed: then she starts and half-turns.

MERTEULIL
So how are you adapting to the
outside world?

' CECILE
Very well. I think.

VOLANGES
I've advised her to watch and
learn and be quiet except when
spoken to.

MERTEUIL looks CECILE up and down, frankly appraising her.
MERTEUIL
We must see what we can devise
for your amusement.

The mirrored double-doors open and MERTEUIL's MAJORDOMIO,
carrying a silver tray, advances unhurriedly across the room.
Q

Continued

At the table, the large playing cards slap down on one
another. MERTEUIL glances up at her MAJORDOMO and reaches
for the card on his tray. She replaces the card, looks up
at him and nods. The MAJORDOMO departs and MERTEUIL speaks
quietly to VOLANGES.

MERTEUIL
Valmont is here.

VOLANGES reacts with a trace of alarm.

VOLANGES
You receive him, do you?

MERTEUIL
Yes. So do you.

VOLANGES turns to her daughter, whose interest has been
caught by this exchange.

VOLANGES
Monsieur le Vicomte de Valmont,
my child, whom you very probably
don't remember, except that he is
conspicuously charming, never
opens his mouth without first
calculating what damage he can do.

CECILE
They why do you receive him, Maman?

VOLANGES
Everyone receives him.

She breaks off as the MAJORDOMO reappears, escorting
VALMONT, who crosses to bow formally to MERTEUIL in a gesture
which also takes in the’ others.

VALMONT
Madame.
' MERTEULL
Vicomte.
VOLANGES

What a pleasant surprise.

VALMONT
Madame de Volanges. How delight-
ful to see you.

VOLANGES ,
You remember my daughter, Cecile?
 

   

Continued

VALMONT
Well, indeed, but who could have
foretold she would flower so
gracefully?

CECILE simpers, blushing and looking away. VALMONT
turns back to MERTEUIL.

VALMONT
I wanted to call on you before
leaving the city.

MERTEUIL
Oh, I'm not sure we can allow
that. Why should you want to
leave?

VALMONT
Paris in August, you know: and
it's time I paid a visit on my
old aunt, I've neglected her .
disgracefully.

/ VOLANGES
Madame de Rosemonde has been
good enough to invite us to stay
at the chateau. Will you please
give her our warmest regards?

VALMONT
I shall make a point of it,
Madame.

VOLANGES puts down her cards and rises decisively,
addressing CECILE.

VOLANGES
I think it's time we took you home.

CECILE responds, still nervously aware of VALMONT's
unwavering stare.
’

CECILE
I'm used to being in bed by nine
at the convent.

VALMONT
So I should hope.

She breaks away, mysteriously alarmed, and hurries across

to VOLANGES. WMERTEUIL has summoned a FOOTMAN. VALMONT
bows and we watch from his P.O.V. as the FOOTMAN shows out
VOLANGES and CECILE. When they've gone, MERTEUIL crosses
back towards VALMONT, speaking in an entirely different tone
of voice.

MERTEUIL
Your aunt?

VALMONT
That's right,

MERTEUIL
I thought she'd already made
arrangements to leave you all
her money.

He smiles without answering. She arrives beside him.

Silence.

MERTEUIL
Do you know why I summoned you
here this evening?

VALMONT
I'd hoped it might be for the
pleasure of my company.

MERTEUIL
I need you; to carry out a
heroic enterprise. You remember
when Bastide left me?

VALMONT feigns a sympathetic expression.

VALMONT
Yes.

MERTEUIL
And went off with that fat
mistress of yours whose name
escapes me.

VALMONT
Yes, yes.

MERTEUIL
No one has ever done that to me
before. Or to you I imagine.

VALMONT
I was quite relieved to be rid
of her, frankly.

MERTEULL
No, you weren't.

She now has his undivided attention.

MERTEUIL
For some years now, Bastide has
been searching for a wife. He was
always unshakeably prejudiced in
favour of convent education. and
now he's found the ideal candidate.

INT. CONVENT Day

CECILE, superintended by a couple of NUNS, waits inside an
enclosure, her face framed between the bars of a wooden
Partition.

a VALMONT (V.0.)
Cecile Volanges.

MERTEUIL (V.0.)
Very good.

EXT. CONVENT DAY

MME DE VOLANGES's magnificent carriage, silhouetted against
the walls of the convent.

VALMONT (V.0.)
And her sixty thousand a year, that
must have played some part in his
calculations.

ANOTHER ANGLE. A FOOTMAN helps MME DE VOLANGES down from
the carriage.

MERTEUIL(V.O.)
None whatsoever. His priority,
you see, is a guaranteed virtue.

INT. CONVENT Day

MME DE VOLANGES hasn't seen CECILE in years. She advances
uncertainly towards her and they exchange a tentative embrace
through the partition.

VALMONT (V.0.)
I wonder if'I'm beginning to guess
what it is you're intending to
propose.

A NUN opens the half-door to release CECILE.
‘ MERTEUIL (V.0.)

Bastide is with his regiment in
Corsica for the rest of the year.

INT. GRAND SALON DUSK

MERTEUIL
That should give you plenty of
time.

VALMONT

You mean to...?

MERTEUIL
She's a rosebud.
r 3 18 Continued

VALMONT
You think so?

MERTEUIL
i And he'd get back from honeymoon
to find himself the laughing-
stock of Paris.

VALMONT
Well...

MERTEUIL
Yes. Love and revenge: two of
your favourites.

| Silence. VALMONT considers for a moment. Finally, he
shakes his head.

VALMONT
No, I can't.
MERTEUIL
What?
: : VALMONT
P) Really, I can't.
MERTEUIL
Why not?
VALMONT

It's too easy. It is. What is
she, fifteen, she's seen nothing,
she knows nothing, she's bound to
be curious, she'd be on her back
before you'd unwrapped the first
: bunch of flowers. Any one of a
dozen men could manage it. I.
have my reputation to think of.

MERTEUIL frowns, displeased. VALMONT hesitates, looking

aft her.
VALMONT
I can see I'm going to have to
tell you everything.
MERTEUIL
Of course you are.
VALMONT
cr ) Yes. Well. My aunt is not on

her own just at the moment. She
has a young friend staying with
her: Madame dé Tourvel.

MERTEUIL
You can't mean it.

EXT. FORMAL GARDENS OF MME DE ROSEMONDE'S CHATEAU DAY

MME DE TOURVEL's strong, beautiful, untroubled face, as

she moves through the gardens. She's accompanied. by VALMONT's
80-year-old aunt, MME DE ROSEMONDE, who chooses flowers,

which MME DE TOURVEL then cuts and lays in a basket.

VALMONT (V.0.)
To seduce a woman famous for
atrict morals, religious fervour
and the happiness of her marriage:
what could possibly be more
prestigious?

MERTEUIL
I think there's something degrading
about having a husband for a rival.
It's humiliating if you fail and
commonplace if you succeed. Where
is M. de Tourvel anyway?

VALMONT (V.0.)
Presiding over some endless case
in Burgundy.

INT. GRAND SALON DUSK
MERTEUIL frowns at VALMONT, shaking her head.

MERTEULL
I don't think you can hope for any
actual pleasure.

VALMONT
Oh, yes. And I have no intention
of breaking down her prejudices.

‘ TY want her to boliovo im Coed and
virtue and the sanctity of marriage
and still not be able to stop herself.
I want passion, in other words. I
want the excitement of watching her
betray everything that's most
important to her. Surely you under-
stand that. I thought betrayal was
your favourite word.

MERTEUIL
No, no, cruelty: I always think
that has a nobler ring to it.

VALMONT smiles; but MERTEUIL turns on him, her expression
serious.
 

 

Y a ° 10
20 Continued
MERTEUIL

I'm surprised at you. You might
just as well be in love.

VALMONT
I haven't felt so strongly about
t anything since you and I were

together. That's why I intend to
’ have her, to rescue myself from
this ridiculous position.

MERTEUIL
Love is something you use, not
something you fall into, like
! quicksand, don't you remember?
y It's like medicine, you use it
' as a lubricant to nature.

He returns, a little uneasily, her challenging gaze.

21 INT. CORRIDOR OF MIRRORS DUSK

-~ . The first-floor landing in MERTEUIL's house is an immense
3) gallery of mirrors. She and VALMONT pass down the corridor,
their images shifting and multiplying in the candle-light.

VALMONT
How's Belleroche?

MERTEUIL
I'm very pleased with him.

VALMONT
And is he your only lover?

MERTEUIL pretends to give this a moment's consideration.

MERTEUIL
Yes.

VALMONT
I think you should take another,
I think it most unhealthy, this
exclusivity.

MERTEUIL
You're not jealous, are you?

” VALMONT
t ‘5 Of course I am. Belleroche is
a completely undeserving.

MERTEUIL
I thought he was one of your
closest friends.

VALMONT
Exactly, so I know what I'm
talking about. No, I think you
should organise an infidelity.
With me, for example.

MERTEUIL
You refuse me a simple favour
and then you expect to be
indulged?

VALMONT
It's only because it is so simple.
It wouldn't feel like a conquest.
I have to follow my destiny. I
have to be true to my profession.

INT. MAIN STAIRCASE DUSK

VALMONT pauses at the top of the broad and imposing staircase
which leads down to the entrance of the house. MERTEUIL
watches him for a moment, amused: then she comes to an
unexpected decision.

MERTEUIL
All right, then: come back when
you've succeeded with Madame de

Tourvel.
VALMONT
Yes?
MERTEULL
And I will offer you...a reward.
VALMONT
My love.
MERTEUIL
But I shall require proof.
' VALMONT
Certainly.
MERTEUIL
Written proof.
VALMONT
Ah.
MERTEUIL

Not negotiable.
VALMONT recovers quickly.

VALMONT

He kisses her hand and hurries down the stairs.

INT. CORRIDOR OF MIRRORS DUSK

MERTEUIL stops in front of one of the mirrors. It turns
out to be a door, which she opens.

INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE DUSK

A candle at the top sheds a dim light; MERTEUIL begins
to ascend her secret staircase.

INT. MERTEUIL'S BEDROOM DUSK

BELLEROCHE, a beautiful blockhead of about 30, springs to
his feet as MERTEUIL emerges from what is ostensibly a
cupboard door. He hurries over to embrace her.

BELLEROCHE
Where have you been? Time has
no logic when I'm not with you:
an hour is like a century.

MERTEUIL
I've told you before: we shall
get on a good deal better if you
make a concerted effort not to
sound like the latest novel.

He looks hurt; she kisses him affectionately.

'
INT. PRIVATE CHAPEL IN MME DE ROSEMONDE'S GROUNDS DAY

The sound of the little silver bell which summons the
congregation to take Communion: CLOSE ON MME DE TOURVEL
as her hands part to reveal her face. MME DE ROSEMONDE
kneels next to her and is now being helped to her feet
by VALMONT.

VALMONT escorts ROSEMONDE up the stairs to the altar-rail,
TOURVEL remaining on the other side of her. The rest of
the congregation consists of ROSEMONDE's domestic staff,
in a segregated portion of the chapel; and they file up
towards the altar, respectfully waiting their turn.

TOURVEL kneels at the altar-rail as VALMONT helps ROSEMONDE
to kneel beside her. Then TOURVEL looks up, slightly
surprised, as VALMONT moves off to one side, instead of
taking his place at the rail. By now, the elderly CURE,
intoning the Latin mass, is approaching TOURVEL with the
large Communion wafer. VALMONT watches intently.

VALMONT'S P.O.V.: the wafer is placed on TOURVEL's lower
lip and slowly vanishes into her mouth. She looks up at him.

TOURVEL'S P.O.V.: VALMONT, his expression respectful, his
demeanour hunble.

EXT. CHAPEL DAY

Beautiful summer's day. The chapel is in the grounds of

MME DE ROSEMONDE's chateau, the turrets of which are visible
in the distance. Her open carriage stands waiting, as the
congregation emerges into the sunlight. The COACHMAN jumps
down, but MME DE ROSEMONDE dismisses him with a gesture.

ROSEMONDE
It's such a beautiful day, I
believe we'll walk.

AZOLAN attends to VALMONT, taking his prayer-book and
handing him his cane; while MME DE TOURVEL's chambermaid,
JULIE, is helping her mistress with her bonnet.

EXT. WOODLAND PATH DAY
MME DE ROSEMONDE and the CURE lead the way, deep in

conversation, followed at a distance by VALMONT and MME DE
TOURVEL. AZOLAN and JULIE bring up the rear.

TOURVEL
You didn't take the sacrament
today.
' VALMONT

I felt L couldn't.

TOURVEL
May I ask why?

VALMONT
I have this appalling reputation
as you may know...

TOURVEL
Oh, yes, I have been warned about
you. .

VALMONT
You have? By whom?
TOURVEL
A friend.
VALMONT

Yes, well, I suppose a warning
might be justified. I've spent
my life surrounded by immoral
people; I've allowed myself to
be influenced by them and
sometimes even taken pride in
outshining them.

TOURVEL
And now?

VALMONT
Now what I feel most often is
unworthiness.

. TOURVEL
But it's precisely at such
moments you start to become
worthy.

VALMONT appears to give this assertion his serious
consideration. He glances back over his shoulder and
notices that AZOLAN is murmuring with some intimacy into
JULIE's ear. Then he turns back to MME D= TOURVEL.

VALMONT
I certainly believe that one should
constantly strive to improve oneself.

LONG SHOT of the two of ‘them, strolling along the dappled
path, as, on SOUND, the passionate climax of a Gluck aria
begins to swell.

INT. MERTEUIL'S BOX AT THE OPERA EVENING

The aria continues, the opera is in progress. MME DE
VOLANGES and CECILE, in the box, stare down at the Stage.
MME DE MERTEUIL, however, opera-glasses pressed to her face,
is scanning the audience.

INT. OPERA HOUSE EVENING

MERTEUIL'S P.O.V., as her gaze comes to rest on the face
of a handsome young man of not more than twenty, listening
intently, tears streaming down his face: the CHEVALIER
DANCENY.

INT. MERTEUIL'S BOX EVENING

MERTEUIL lowers her opera-glasses, pensive.

INT. OPERA HOUSE EVENING

The interval, and the fashionable audience goes about its
principal business of the evening: gossip and celebrity-
spotting. DANCENY moves through the auditorium, still in
something of a trance; and is startled by the arrival of
a uniformed FOOTMAN, who hands him a note on a silver tray.

INT. MERTEUIL'S BOX EVENING

A knock at the door and DANCENY, charmingly shy and uncertain,
bows deeply to MERTEUIL.

MERTEUIL
Chevalier, I don't. believe you
know my cousin, Madame de Volanges.
This is Chevalier Danceny. And
Madame's daughter, Cecile.

All this has taken place very quickly and now DANCENY becomes
aware of CECILE for the first time: he looks at her, tongue-
tied, obviously smitten, eventually managing to utter a
strangled greeting. MERTEUIL observes him shrewdly.

MERTEUIL
Tell us what we should think of
the opera.

DANCENY

Oh, it's sublime. Don't you find?

MERTEUIL
Why do these composers keep
choosing identical subjects?

DANCENY
But this is infinitely the better
‘ version. Piccini is a mere
opportunist.

MERTEUIL
Monsieur Danceny is one of those
rare eccentrics who come here to
listen to the music.

DANCENY
I do look forward to our next
meeting.

He bows to CECILE, blushing deeply and leaves the box.
CECILE's eyes are shining. MERTEUIL is watching her
closely.

MERTEUIL
Charming young man. Penniless,
regrettably. He's one of the
finest music-teachers in the city.

CLOSE on CECILE: the idea occurs to her at the very
moment MERTEUIL expresses it.

MERTEUIL
Perhaps you should employ him.

EXT. GROUNDS OF THE CHATEAU DAWN

VALMONT and AZOLAN, who carries a long musket over his
shoulder, crunch across the gravel. As they pass, a PAN
reveals MME DE TOURVEL's footman, GEORGES, following them,
huddled in an angle of the building.

INT/EXT. MME DE TOURVEL'S BEDROOM DAWN

MME DE TOURVEL stands, a corner of the curtain raised,
looking down at VALMONT and AZOLAN.

EXT. WOODS DAWN

VALMONT speaks abruptly to AZOLAN, surprising him in mid-
yawn.

VALMONT
How are you getting on’ with
Madame de Tourvel's maid?

AZOLAN
Julie? Tell you the truth, it's been
a bit boring. Lf I wasn't so anxious
to keep your Lordship abreast, I think
I'd have only bothered the once.
Still, you know, what else is there
‘ to do in the country?

VALMONT
Yes, it wasn't so much the details
of your intimacy I was after, it
was whether she's agreed to bring
me Madame de Tourvel's letters.

AZOLAN
She won't steal the letters, sir.

VALMONT
She won't?

AZOLAN
You know better than me, sir,
it's easy enough making them do
what they want to do; it's trying
to get them to do what you want
them to do, that's what gives
you a headache.

VALMONT
And them, as often as not. I need
to know who's writing to her about
me.

AZOLAN
I shouldn't worry if I was you,
sir. She told Julie she didn't
believe you went hunting in the
mornings. She said she was going
to have you followed. So I'd
say it was only a matter of time.

They carry on through the woods. Behind them, GEORGES
blunders incompetently from tree to tree.

EXT. BOUNDARY OF MME DE ROSEMONDE'S LAND DAY

AZOLAN unlocks a gate in the wall enclosing ROSEMONDE's
property to let VALMONT through. The latter hesitates,
looking back.

VALMONT
Terrible noise he's making.

AZOLAN
He'll get the news back to her
twice as quickly.

VALMONT

I don't think we should make
’ . it too easy for him.
He takes the musket from AZOLAN and suddenly fires it
into the undergrowth.
EXT. UNDERGROWTH DAY
GEORGES, panic-stricken, hurls himself to the ground as
the echoes of the shot die away.
EXT. BOUNDARY OF MME DE ROSEMONDE'S LAND DAY
VALMONT hands the musket back to AZOLAN and closes the gate

behind them. The wall stretches away as far as the eye can
see. The two men grin at each other and hurry on.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE DAY

The village consists of half-a-dozen wattle-and-daub

huts, disposed around a muddy clearing; where pigs graze

and bare-foot children wander. The poverty is as stark and
absolute as that of a village in India. A small crowd is
gathered around one of the huts, out of which a couple of
MEN, supervised by the BAILIFF are carrying out a plain

deal table, which they dump down next to three wooden chairs.
A gaunt WOMAN follows them, miserably wringing her hands.

GEORGES hurries across the square, reaching the fringes of
the crowd just as VALMONT steps forward to confront the
BAILIFF.

VALMONT
What exactly do you think you're
doing?

BAILIFF
I am impounding these effects,
sir.

VALMONT
Has it not been explained to you?
M. Armand is not well.

BAILIFF .
I don't make the laws, sir, I
just do what I'm told. Everybody
has to pay his taxes.

VALMONT
How much does he owe?

BAILIFF
Well...

VALMONT
How much?

BALLIFF

Fifty-six livres.

VALMONT takes a large, jingling purse out of his pocket
and hands it to AZOLAN.

VALMONT
Pay him.

AZOLAN
Yes, my lord.

Gasps from the crowd; even a ripple of applause.
VALMONT marches forward and vanishes into the hut.

INT. ARMAND'S HUT Day

Standing on the straw spread over the mud floor, in the
heat of the more or less unventilated, dingy hut, looking
down at M. ARMAND, (a man of not more than 50, who looks
ancient, gnarled and battered by work, with long, thick
white hair), VALMONT has to make an effort not to be
overcome by the fetid atmosphere.

VALMONT
You don't know me...

ARMAND
Of course I do, M. le Vicomte.

VALMONT
Ah. No, please, don't get up.

ARMAND is struggling up-.out of his large pallet bed
covered with sacking.

ARMAND
I have to, sir. They're taking
the bed.

VALMONT

Not at all, M. Armand. No one is
taking anything.

EXT. ARMAND'S HUT DAY

The crowd scatters as VALMONT emerges from the hut. He
approaches the BAILIFF.

VALMONT:
Kindly instruct your men to
replace M. Armand's furniture.

The gaunt WOMAN approaches VALMONT; she's accompanied by
a toil-worn younger COUPLE and a pair of thin, sickly-
looking CHILDREN.

‘ WOMAN
You're an angel sent from heaven.

Suddenly, all of them are on their knees to VALMONT.
Genuinely touched, he. looks across at AZOLAN, then manages
to free a hand to reach for his purse. AZOLAN passes it
to him and he fetches out a handful of gold, pressing it
into the WOMAN's reluctant hand.

VALMONT
Just to tide you over. IL insist.

Again the crowd bursts into spontaneous applause. GEORGES
watches thoughtfully. .

EXT. BOUNDARY OF MME DE ROSEMONDE'S LAND DAY

AZOLAN unlocks a compartment in one of the brick gateposts
and takes out a wooden mailbox with a slot in the top.
Then he takes a pin from his wig and begins delicately

to probe the loek of the mailbox as they talk.

: VALMONT
Fifty-six livres to save an
entire family from ruin, that
seems a genuine bargain.

AZOLAN
These days, my lord, you can find
half-a-dozen like that, any village
in the country.

VALMONT oe
Really? I must say the family was
very well chosen. Solidly respectable,
gratifyingly tearful, no suspiciously
pretty girls. Well done. :

AZOLAN
I do my best for you, sir.

VALMONT
And all that humble gratitude. It
was most affecting.

AZOLAN “
Certainly brought a tear to my eye.

The lock yields to his manipulations, the mailbox opens and
after a brief inspection he hands two letters to VALMONT,
who glances at the postmarks and hands one of them straight
back to AZOLAN. .

VALMONT :
Dijon. That's from her husband.

He holds the other letter which is ina distinctive,
somewhat pretentious envelope, up to the light.

VALMONT
I'm sure this must be from that
officious friend of hers.

He passes it back to AZOLAN, who returns it to the mailbox
and closes it. They move off, back in the direction of the
house.

VALMONT
Tell me, where do you and Julie
meet? .
AZOLAN non

Oh, in my room, sir.

VALMONT
And is she coming tonight?
AZOLAN
Afraid so.
VALMONT

Then I think I may have to burst
in on you. See if blackmail will
succeed better than bribery.
About two o'clock suit you? I
don't want to embarrass you, will
that give you enough time?

AZOLAN
Ample, sir.

In the background GEORGES has come through the gate.
He unlocks the mailbox and takes out the letters it
contains.

INT. GRAND SALON IN THE CHATEAU DAY

VALMONT looks up from his book, as MME DE ROSEMONDE bustles
into the room, followed by MME DE TOURVEL. He rises to
greet them.

ROSEMONDE
Is this true about M. Armand?

VALMONT
I don't believe I know anyone
of that name...

TOURVEL
You may as well own up, Monsieur.
My footman happened to be passing
when you were in the village this
morning.

‘ VALMONT
I don't think you ought to pay
too much attention to servants
gossip.

ROSEMONDE
It is true, isn't it?

VALMONT
Well, I...it's simply...Yes.

He looks up, ostensibly deeply embarrassed, to catch MME DE
TOURVEL's admiring gaze. MME DE ROSEMONDE spreads her arms.

ROSEMONDE
You dear boy. come and let me
give you a hug!

VALMONT crosses to her and they embrace. Then VALMONT
turns and advances towards MME DE TOURVEL. Before she

can escape, he's embraced her and, for a second, she's

in his arms. Meanwhile MME DE ROSEMONDE's STEWARD has
entered, with the mail laid out on a salver. As MME DE.
TOURVEL escapes from VALMONT's arms, she finds the STEWARD
at her elbow. Ashen, she shakily reaches out her hand for
the two letters.

INT. GRAND SALON IN MME DE MERTEUIL'S HOUSE Day

CECILE is playing the harp and singing a song, accompanied
by DANCENY on the harpsichord. On the far side of the room
are MERTEUIL and VOLANGES, paying far more attention to
their murmured conversation than to the music. After a time,
DANCENY breaks off, hitting a note several times to indicate
where CECILE's voice has gone wrong. They resume a few bars
back; this time CECILE gets it right and DANCENY nods in
approval. They proceed until CECILE makes a mistake with the
harp. DANCENY stops and comes over to join her. He plays
the complicated little phrase. CECILE tries it, but can't
manage it. He takes her hands and adjusts them to the
correct position. She almost plays the phrase correctly,
looks up at him smiling.

DANCENY
Try it again.

She does so and gets it right.

DANCENY
Very good.

As he turns away, he slips a piece of paper between the harp
strings. CECILE frowns, then, as he arrives back at the
harpsichord, she snatches it and unfolds it. On it is a
message written in pencil: I LOVE YOU.

Blushing furiously, she crumples the piece of paper and stuffs
it into her pocket. Then she darts an angry glance at DANCENY
’

DANCENY
This is very difficult, I'm
afraid. Can we start again?

He begins to play and CECILE, with a great effort, manages
to come in almost on cue.

INT. MERTEUIL'S BOX AT. THE OPERA EVENING

The opera is in full swing. MERTEUIL and CECILE murmur

to one another in the darkened box, neither paying the
slightest attention to the stage below.

CECILE
Would it be very wrong of me
to answer M. Danceny's letters?

MERTEUIL
In the circumstances, yes.

CECILE
In what circumstances?

MERTEUIL pretends to reflect before answering.

MERTEUIL
It's not my place to tell you
this, my dear...if I hadn't become
so fond of you...

CECILE
Go on, please!

MERTEUIL
Your marriage has been arranged.

CECILE gapes at her: but this has not come as a total
surprise and her curiosity quickly overcomes her alarm.

CECILE
Who is it?
MERTEUIL

Someone I know, slightly.
M le Comte de Bastide.

CECILE
What's he like?

MERTEULL
Well...

CECILE
You don't like him.

MERTEUIL

It's not that. He's a man of
somewhat...erratic judgment.
And rather serious.

CECILE
How old is he?

MERTEUIL
Thirty-six.

CECILE

Thirty-six? He's an old man!

MERTEUIL smiles, as another thought galvanises CECILE.

CECILE
Do you know when?

MERTEUIL
In the new year, I believe.

She stares, unseeing, at the stage, lost in thought.
MERTEUIL leans in closer to her.

MERTEUIL
Perhaps there is a way to let
you write to M. Danceny...

CECILE
Oh, Madame!

She's caught hold of MERTEUIL's hand, her eyes shining.

: MERTEUIL
If you were to show me both
sides of the correspondence, I
could reassure myself...

CECILE throws herself into MERTEUIL's arms and embraces
her. MERTEUIL's eyes glitter in the darkness. Then
CECILE looks up at her.

CECILE
I can't show you the letters I've
already sent him...

She breaks off, realising she's given herself away, her
expression apprehensive. But MERTEUIL's smile is indulgent.

As the impassioned love-duet on stage reaches a climax,

phe stretches out a hand to caress CECILE's neck and collar-
one.

INT. GRAND SALON IN THE CHATEAU NIGHT

VALMONT is reading and MME DE TOURVEL is looking over her
letter from Paris, the one with the distinctive envelope.
Eventually, she looks up at him and breaks the silence.

TOURVEL
I can't understand how someone
whose instincts are so generous,
could lead such a dissolute life.

VALMONT
I'm afraid you have an exaggerated
idea both of my generosity and of
my depravity. If I knew who'd
given you such a dire account of me...

MME DE TOURVEL folds up her letter, her expression sheepish.

VALMONT
The truth is, the key to the
paradox lies in a certain weakness
of character.

TOURVEL
How could so thoughtful an act
of charity be described as weak?

VALMONT -
Because it was performed purely
in response to your influence.

TOURVEL
I have tried to set you a good
example these last two weeks.

VALMONT
And you've succeeded. What I did
today was nothing more than an
innocent tribute to your goodness.

MME DE TOURVEL looks away. VALMONT sighs.

VALMONT
You see how weak I am? I promised
myself I was never going to tell you.
It's just, looking at you...

TOURVEL
Monsieur.

VALMONT
You needn't worry, I have no illicit
intentions. I wouldn't dream of
insulting you. But I do love you.
I adore you.

The letter slips from MME DE TOURVEL's fingers. VALMONT
is across the room in an instant, on his knees in front of
her, handing her the letter and then taking her hand in his.

VALMONT
Please help me.

As MME DE TOURVEL wrenches her hands free, a door opens to
admit MME DE ROSEMONDE's STEWARD. In the ensuing confusion,
TOURVEL gets up, snatches a candlestick, and hurries out of
the room, leaving VALMONT momentarily floundering.

INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT

MME DE TOURVEL's back recedes down the corridor.
Presently, VALMONT comes into frame, catching her up.
But TOURVEL disappears into her room and there's the
sound of a heavy bolt. VALMONT arrives at her door and
drops to his knees, pressing his eye to her keyhole.

INT. MME DE TOURVEL'S BEDROOM NIGHT

KEYHOLE SHOT: MME DE TOURVEL crosses to the window and
stands looking out into the night, her expression troubled.

INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT

VALMONT stands up. There's a look of satisfaction on his
face as he begins to tiptoe away.

INT. AZOLAN'S BEDROOM NIGHT

AZOLAN is in bed with JULIE, they're asleep in each other's
arms. Suddenly the door bursts open. VALMONT stands in the
doorway in his dressing gown, holding a candlestick. In its
flickering light, AZOLAN and JULIE wake, JULIE genuinely
terrified and AZOLAN (since this has been prearranged)
convincingly dismayed.

VALMONT
I rang a number of times.

AZOLAN
Didn't hear, sir.

VALMONT
’ I require some hot water.

AZOLAN
Right away, sir.

He jumps out of bed, uncovering JULIE. She reaches for the
sheets but VALMONT speaks sharply, stopping her in her tracks.

VALMONT
Don't move.

As AZOLAN puts on a dressing gown and hurries to the door,
VALMONT settles himself on the end of the bed, his eyes
burning into JULIE.

who is becoming increasingly uncomfortable.

VALMONT
I can't condone this sort of
behaviour, you know, Julie.

JULIE
I know, sir, I'm sorry...

VALMONT
But you may rely on my discretion...

JULIE

VALMONT

There's a silence, during which JULIE thinks she understands
what he means. Her expression changes as she tries to work
out how best to react. But VALMONT shakes his head.

VALMONT
No, no, nothing like that. No,
all I want is to see every letter
Mme de Tourvel has received since
her arrival here and every letter
she writes from now on.

JULIE
’ But, sir...

VALMONT
Deliver them to Azolan by midnight

He stands, continuing to look at her for a moment, until

she snatches at the sheet and covers herself. He brings

a handful of gold coins out of his dressing-gown pocket

EXT. GARDENS OF THE CHATEAU pay

MME DE TOURVEL rounds the right-angle of a manicured hedge
and stops dead in her tracks. Bearing down on her is
VALMONT. She turns in confusion, but there's evidently

no escape and in a moment he's with her, bowing deep.

VALMONT
I shouldn't have spoken to you
like that yesterday, I'm sorry.

TOURVEL
I thought the least I could hope
for was that you would respect me.

VALMONT
I don't want you to think this has
anything to do with your beauty.
I know now that beauty is the least
of your qualities. L've become
fascinated by your goodness. I
couldn't understand what was
happening to me and it was only
when I began to feel actual physical
pain every time you left the room,
that it finally dawned on me: I was
in love, for the first time in my

life.

TOURVEL
I really will have to leave you,
Monsieur.

VALMONT

No, no, please, tell me what to
do, show me how to behave, I'll do
anything you say.

MME DE TOURVEL has turned away from him; now, after a
moment's thought, she turns back.

TOURVEL
There's only one thing I would
like you to do for me.

VALMONT
What? What is it?

TOURVEL
I'm not sure I want to put myself
in the position of being beholden
to you.

Oh, please, I insist.

TOURVEL
Very well, then, I would like you

VALMONT
I don't see why that should be

TOURVEL

Let's just say you've spent your

By now VALMONT has recovered his equilibrium and thought
very fast.

VALMONT
I shall find something in my mail
tomorrow morning which obliges me
to return to Paris.

TOURVEL
Thank you, I'd be very grateful.

She begins to move away. VALMONT lets her go two or three
steps before speaking.

. VALMONT
Perhaps I might ask a favour in
return?

MME DE TOURVEL frowns, hesitating.

VALMONT
I think it would only be just to
let me know which of your friends
has blackened my name.

. TOURVEL
You know very well that's impossible,
Monsieur. If friends of mine have
warned me against you, they've done
so purely in my own interest. I could
hardly reward them with betrayal!

VALMONT
Very well, I withdraw the request.
Will you at least allow me to write
to you?

TOURVEL
Well...

VALMONT
And hope that you will do me the
kindness of answering my letters?

TOURVEL

you is something a woman of honour
could permit herself.

VALMONT
But what?

MME DE TOURVEL seems unable to find a satisfactory answer
to this.

INT. AZOLAN'S BEDROOM NIGHT

There's a knock at the door: AZOLAN makes a wry face and

lets in JULIE. He embraces her; but what has immediately
caught his interest is the bundle of letters in her hand.

As soon as he decently can, he extricates himself from the
embrace and takes the letters from her.

INT. VALMONT'S BEDROOM DAWN

VALMONT sits at a bureau, inspecting the letters, his
expression indignant. AZOLAN stands to one side, looking
complacent.

VALMONT
Listen to this: ‘Just as every
good man has his weaknesses,
every criminal has his virtues.
So be doubly careful of the
Vicomte de Valmont.’

He turns the letter over and reads out the signature, nodding
grimly.

VALMONT

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE CHATEAU DAY

VALMONT embraces MME DE ROSEMONDE as his. big black carriage
waits at the foot of a flight of outside steps. MME DE
TOURVEL waits, a little to one side. VALMONT crosses to
her, takes her hand and kisses it, taking her by surprise.
She tries to withdraw her hand but he holds on to it.

She speaks in an undertone.

TOURVEL

He releases her hand and adds, in a murmur.

INT. EMILIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT

VALMONT is making energetic love to EMILIE, a strikingly
attractive courtesan, in her luxurious canopied bed.

After a while, he sighs with pleasure and pulls away from
her. Outside, there are occasional rumbles of thunder and
flashes of lightning. He looks down at her for a moment,
leaning on one elbow.

VALMONT
Now.

EMILIE
Yes?

VALMONT
Turn over.

EMILIE hesitates, looking up at him for a moment. Then
she breaks into a smile.

EMILIE
All right.

She turns over and looks up at him expectantly. He twitches
away the bedclothes and contemplates her briefly, before
speaking, very businesslike.

VALMONT
Do you have pen, ink and
writing paper?

EMILIE
Yes, over there, in the bureau.
Why?

Puzzled, she watches him as he gets up, crosses the room,
finds what he's looking for and brings it. back to the bed.
He puts down the pen and inkwell carefully, then climbs
on to EMILIE, spreads a sheet of paper across the small
of her back, arranges himself comfortably and reaches

for the pen.

VALMONT
Now, don't move.

EMILIE is still puzzled, but she submits graciously enough.
VALMONT begins to write.

middle of a stormy night, during
which I have been tossed from
exaltation to exhaustion and

power of love...'

VALMONT (V.0.)

sufficiently to put my thoughts

torments, I guarantee that at
this moment I am far happier
than you...'

The letter: a teardrop falls on to the paper, smudging the
ink.

EMILIE is reaching back to caress VALMONT as he writes.

VALMONT
'...I hope one day you may feel
the kind of disturbance afflicting
me now: meanwhile please excuse
me while I take steps to calm what
I can only describe as a mounting
excitement.'

INT. GRAND SALON IN MME DE MERTEUIL'S HOUSE DAY

It's September now and there's a hint of Autumn in the

afternoon light. VALMONT is taking tea with the MARQUISE
DE MERTEUIL.

VALMONT

Your damned cousin, the Volanges
bitch, wanted me away from Madame
de Tourvel: well, now I am and I
intend to make her suffer for it.
Your plan to ruin her daughter,
are you making any progress, is
there anything I can do to help,
I'm entirely at your disposal.

MERTEULL
Well, yes, I told Danceny you would
act as his confidant and advisor.
I want you to stiffen his resolve,
if that's the phrase.

VALMONT frowns, not at all pleased.

MERTEULL
I thought if anyone could help him...

VALMONT
Help? He doesn't need help, he
needs hindrances: if he has to
climb over enough of them, he
might inadvertently fall on top
of her.

He shakes his head dismissively, gets up and moves over
to flop down on a chaise-longue.

VALMONT
I take it he hasn't been a great
success,

MERTEUIL

He's been disastrous. Like most
intellectuals, he's intensely
stupid.

VALMONT enjoys this: he looks at MERTEUIL, shaking his head
in admiration.

VALMONT
I often wonder how you managed to
invent yourself.

MERTEUIL
I had no choice, did I, I'm a woman.
When I came out into society, I was
fifteen, nobody had taught me anything:

MERTEUIL (Cont)
and it wasn't pleasure I was after,
it was knowledge. So I practised
detachment. I learned how to smile
Pleasantly while, under the table,
I stuck a fork into the back of my
hand. I became not merely
impenetrable, but a virtuoso of deceit.
Women are obliged to be far more skilful
than men. So of course I had to invent:
not only myself, but ways of escape no
one else has ever thought of. And I've
succeeded, because I always knew I was
born to dominate your sex and avenge
my own. I operate on a wonderfully
simple principle: win or die.

VALMONT
Does that make you infallible?

MERTEUIL
When I want a man, I have him; when
he wants to tell, he finds he can't.
That's the whole story.

VALMONT
And was that our story?

MERTEUIL pauses before answering: the air is becoming
increasingly charged with eroticism.

MERTEUIL
I wanted you before we'd even met.
My self-esteem demanded it. Then,
when you began to pursue me, I wanted
you so badly. It's the only one of
my notions has ever got the better
of me. Single combat.

VALMONT
Thank you.

'
A heavy silence is broken by the sudden opening of the
mirrored double-doors. MERTEUIL's MAJORDOMO moves over
and murmurs to her. She nods in acknowledgement. The
MAJORDOMO sets off again, back towards the door. MERTEUIL
indicates a screen, which stands in a distant corner of
the room.

MERTEUIL
If you'd care to go behind the
screen, Vicomte, I've arranged a
little scene I hope you may find
entertaining.

VALMONT frowns at her, puzzled.

MERTEUIL
Well, hurry.

VALMONT rises and moves swiftly across the room. He's
in place behind the screen just in time to avoid being
seen by MME DE VOLANGES, who hurries in looking slightly
flustered, accompanied by the MAJORDOMO. MERTEUIL, who
has assumed a grave expression, rises to greet her,
kissing her on both cheeks.

VOLANGES
Your note said it was urgent...

MERTEUIL
It's days now, I haven't been
able to think about anything else,
I couldn't decide what to do for
the best. Please, sit down.

VALMONT listens behind the screen, bemused. VOLANGES
takes a seat, thoroughly alarmed.

MERTEUIL
I have reason to believe that a,
how can [ describe it, a dangerous
liaison has sprung up between your
daughter and the Chevalier Danceny.

Behind the screen, VALMONT is dumbfounded by this; he
shakes his head, at a loss to understand MERTEUIL's
tactics. Meanwhile, VOLANGES is confidently dismissing
the suggestion.

VOLANGES
No, no, that's completely absurd.
Cécile is still a child, she under-
Stands nothing of these things; and
Danceny is an entirely respectable
young man.

MERTEUIL
Tell me, does Cécile have a great
many correspondents?

" YOLANGES
Why do you ask?

MERTEUIL
I went into her room at the beginning
of this week, I simply knocked and
entered; and she was stuffing a
letter into the left-hand drawer of
her bureau; in which, I couldn't
help noticing, there seemed to be
a large number of other letters.

MERTEUIL rings. VOLANGES stands up, still in a state of
mild shock.

MERTEUIL
Would you think it impertinent if
I were to make another suggestion?

VOLANGES
No, no.

MERTEULL
If my recollection is correct, I
overheard you saying to the Vicomte
de Valmont that his aunt had invited
you and Cécile to stay at her chateau.

CLOSE ON VALMONT. His eyes narrow and a smile begins to
spread across his face.

VOLANGES
She has, yes, repeatedly.

MERTEUIL
A spell in the country might be
the very thing.

The MAJORDOMO has returned and MERTEUIL beckons him over.
She gestures urgently and VALMONT suddenly realises he is
visible in the mirrored: door. He takes evasive action just
in time, as MERTEUIL is speaking to the MAJORDOMO.

MERTEUIL
Show Madame de Volanges to her
, carriage.

She embraces VOLANGES warmly, checking that VALMONT is no
longer visible.

Bowed down with care, VOLANGES shuffles out of the room
after the MAJORDOMO. VALMONT emerges from behind the screer

as MERTEUIL settles on the chaise-longue. He's lost in
admiration. :

INT. CECILE'S BEDROOM IN MME DE VOLANGE'S HOUSE Day

CECILE looks up with a start as MME DE VOLANGES storms into
the room, goes straight to‘her bureau and opens the left-hand
drawer. Her eyes widen in horror as MME DE VOLANGES brings
out a handful of letters,

his face in VALMONT's chest. VALMONT passes a fastidious
hand lightly over DANCENY's hair and picks up the letter.

ROSEMONDE
You'll be pleased to hear, my
dear, that Armand is on his feet
again and back at work.

VALMONT
Who?

ROSEMONDE
Monsieur Armand, whose family you
helped so generously.

VALMONT
Oh, yes.

He finds a seat, equidistant between TOURVEL and CECILE and
stares for a moment at TOURVEL. When she looks up at hin,
he looks away quickly, this time at CECILE, who presently
becomes aware of his gaze and embarrassed by it. VALMONT
turns very quickly back to TOURVEL and is gratified to

catch her still looking at him, though she immediately turns
away. ROSEMONDE meanwhile turns to address VOLANGES.

ROSEMONDE
When my nephew was last Staying
here, we discovered quite by chance...

VALMONT interrupts her, suddenly rising to his feet, still
staring at TOURVEL.

VALMONT
Are you feeling all right, Madame?
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Aunt,
it seemed to me all of a sudden that
Madame de Tourvel didn't look at
all well.

TOURVEL
' I'm...no, I'm quite all right.
By now, ROSEMONDE and VOLANGES are on their feet, converging
on TOURVEL. As they bear down on her, VALMONT steps back,
slips the letter out of his pocket and holds it behind his
back, waving it at CECILE. She's very slow to react, but
eventually she grasps the significance of VALMONT's impatient

‘gestures, tosses her embroidery aside and stuffs the letter

in her pocket. Meanwhile, to the others, MME DE TOURVEL
continues to be the centre of attention.

VOLANGES
Perhaps you need some air. Do you
feel constricted in any way?

TOURVEL
No, really...

VALMONT
I feel sure Madame de Volanges
is right, as usual. A turn
around the grounds perhaps.

. ROSEMONDE
Yes, yes, a little walk in the
garden, it's not too cool, I
think.

TOURVEL frowns in puzzlement as VOLANGES wraps a shawl
round her shoulders and propels her in the direction of
the French windows,

ROSEMONDE
Fresh air will do you the world
of good.

VOLANGES
The meal was somewhat heavy,
perhaps...

ROSEMONDE
I don't believe that can be the
cause...

During this exchange, CECILE has gathered up her shawl and
made to follow the others. As she's spreading it across

her shoulders, however, she's startled to find it tugged
away from her by VALMONT, who drops it on a chair, murmuring
between clenched teeth.

VALMONT
Come back for it.

She frowns at him for a moment, then follows the still-
clucking ladies out into the garden. VALMONT watches with
satisfaction as she stops, says a word to her mother and then
comes hurrying back into the room. VALMONT sits her down,
hands her her shawl and sits opposite her, talking very fast.

VALMONT
IL don't want to arouse suspicion,
Mademoiselle, so I must be brief.
The letter is from the Chevalier
Danceny. :

CECILE
Yes, I thought so, Monsieur.

VALMONT
Now the handing-over of such letters
is a far from easy matter to accomplish.

I can't very well create a diversion
every dav.

At this point VALMONT produces a large key from his waistcoat
pocket,

VALMONT
So, this key resembles the key to
your bedroom, which I happen to know
is kept in your mother's room, on the
mantelpiece, tied with a blue ribbon.
Take it, go up now, attach the blue
ribbon to it and put it in place of
your bedroom key, which you will
then bring to me. I'll be able to
get a copy cut within two hours.
Then I'll be able to collect your
letters and deliver Danceny's
without any complications.

He drops the key into CECILE's lap.

VALMONT
Ob, and in the cupboard by your bed,
you'll find a feather and a small
bottle of oil, so that you can oil
the lock and hinges on the ante-room
door. Off you go.

CECILE
Are you sure, Monsieur, I'm not sure
it would be right...

VALMONT
Trust me.

CECILE
Well, I know Monsieur Danceny has
every confidence in you...

VALMONT
Believe me, Mademoiselle, if there's
one thing I can't abide, it’s
deceitfulness.

She hesitates for a moment and then hurries away.

EXT. TERRACE DAY

VALMONT steps out of the French windows on to the terrace,
where ROSAMONDE, VOLANGES and TOURVEL. are waiting. -

VOLANGES

CECILE grapples with the blue ribbon, experiencing the
greatest difficulty in disentangling it.

EXT. TERRACE DAY

VALMONT, his expression a little tense, has moved away from
the group of waiting women. He's startled when he looks up
to see MME DE TOURVEL bearing down on him, speaking in a
fierce undertone.

TOURVEL
If I did feel i11, Monsieur, it
would not be difficult to guess
who was responsible.

VALMONT is too surprised to answer.

TOURVEL

You promised to leave here.
VALMONT

And I did.
TOURVEL

Then how can you be insensitive
enough to return without warning?

VALMONT is only too aware that MME DE VOLANGES is now
heading purposefully back into the house.

VALMONT
Would you excuse me, Madame?

He breaks away from her and sets off towards a different
entrance into the house.

INT. MME DE VOLANGES'S BEDROOM DAY

CECILE has almost finished tying the blue ribbon on to
the second key, when it Slips from her fingers and drops
into the grate. She falls to her knees and tries to fish
it out. She can't reach it, Suddenly, the creak of the

ante-room door makes her look up in terror. It's VALMONT.

are long enough to reach the ribbon. He fishes the key
out and drops it on the mantelpiece. Then he catches sight
of VOLANGES's shawl, picks it up, thrusts it at CECILE and
dives behind the door, just as VOLANGES arrives.

VOLANGES
What are you doing?

CECILE
I just came up to fetch your
shawl.

She hands her the shawl and they leave the room. VALMONT
waits a few seconds before emerging.

INT. MAIN STAIRCASE DAY

As MME DE VOLANGES and CECILE arrive at the top of the
stairs, so VALMONT arrives at the bottom. They pass on
the stairs, VALMONT moving respectfully to one side, and
VOLANGES ignoring him. CECILE, a pace behind, takes the
opportunity to slip the key into VALMONT's hand, almost
dropping it as she does so.

EXT. FORMAL GARDENS DAY

MME DE TOURVEL and VALMONT sit at either end of a bench
in the rigidly manicured garden.

VALMONT
Why are you so angry with me?

TOURVEL
I'm not angry. Although since
your very first letter spoke
of nothing but the disorders of
love, I'm certainly entitled to
' be.

VALMONT
I was away almost three weeks
and wrote to you only three
times. Since I was quite un-
able to think about anything
but you, some might say I showed
heroic restraint.

about your love.

MERTEUIL sits, en negligée, reading a letter.

VALMONT (V.0.)
‘We go for a walk together almost
every day: a little further every
time down the path that has no
turning.'

EXT. GROUNDS OF THE CHATEAU DAY

VALMONT and MME DE TOURVEL stroll through parklands, the
chateau silhouetted on a ridge behind them, deep in
conversation.

VALMONT
I wish you knew me well enough to
recognise how much you've changed
me. My friends in Paris remarked
on it at once. I've become the
soul of consideration, charitable,
conscientious, more celibate than

a monk...
TOURVEL
More celibate?

Well, you know the stories one
hears in Paris.

two of them moving through the autumn landscape.

both aware how little there is to
choose between them. Her eyes

The hinges no longer squeak as VALMONT, in bis dressing-gown,

lock, turns it, removes and pockets the key, opens the door
and advances.

INT, CECILE'S BEDROOM NIGHT

CECILE is fast asleep inthe large bed. VALMONT closes

the door behind him and crosses silently to the bed. He
Stands for a moment, contemplating CECILE. Then he puts

the lantern down carefully, leans forward and very gently
eases back the covers. CECILE stirs but still doesn't wake.
VALMONT passes his hand through the air, tracing the contours
of her body. Finally, he puts his hand over her mouth.

She wakes with a start, her eyes wide above his hand.
VALMONT smiles and speaks in a whisper.

VALMONT
Nothing to worry about.

He removes his hand. She stares up at him, frowning.

CECILE

Have you brought a letter?
VALMONT

No.
CECILE

Then what...

Instead of answering, he leans forward to kiss her. There's

a brief, fierce struggle, in which CECILE successfully defends
herself from the kiss, but is entirely taken by surprise when
VALMONT plunges a hand up inside her nightdress. Her eyes
widen in horror, but her cry is instantly stifled as VALMONT 's
other hand clamps down on her mouth. She writhes determinedly
for a moment, succeeds in freeing her head and dives across
the bed to reach for the bell-pull. VALMONT leaps on to the
bed, grasping her wrist just in time. She grapples with him
for a moment.

VALMONT
What are you going to tell your
mother? How will you explain
the fact that I have your key?
If I tell her I'm here at your
invitation, I have a feeling she'll
believe me.
CECILE stops struggling, her eyes wide with fear. He's
lying beside her on the bed.

CECILE
What do you want?
VALMONT
Well, I don't know, what do you

think?
His hand goes back up inside her nightdress.

CECILE
No, please, don't. Please.

VALMONT

CECILE
Promise?

VALMONT

Whatever you say.

CECILE flops back on the pillow and closes her eyes.

CECILE

VALMONT leans in and gives her a long kiss, his hands
roaming as he does so. After a while he pulls away,

CECILE
All right?
VALMONT
Very nice.
CECILE
No, I mean, will you go now?
VALMONT
Oh, I don't think so.
CECILE

But you promised.

me a kiss. You didn't give me a

waiting.

VALMONT

CECILE

VALMONT
Let's just get ourselves more
comfortable, shall we?

CECILE
Do you?

VALMONT disposes the sheet over him, moving on top of her
as he does so. He replaces his hand and CECILE reacts with
a start.

CECILE
Please don't do that.
VALMONT
I'll take it away. After the
kiss.
CECILE
Promise?
VALMONT
Yes, yes.
CECILE
Swear?
VALMONT
I swear. Now put your arms round
me.

CECILE reaches up and gives him a long, surprisingly intense
kiss, her eyes tightly closed. Suddenly she gasps and her
eyes open wide with amazement. Slowly VALMONT's hand comes
up from under the cover. CECILE looks at it, appalled.

'

VALMONT
See. I told you I'd take my
hand away.

INT. DINING-ROOM Day

MME DE ROSEMONDE sits at the head of the long polished table
with MME DE VOLANGES on her right and CECILE on her left.
Further down, on VOLANGES's side is VALMONT; opposite him,
MME DE TOURVEL. It's breakfast time and the sideboard is
groaning with beef and poultry and lamb cutlets. VALMONT

is eating heartily; CECILE, on the other hand, stares

VALMONT catches her eye and gives her an imperceptible wink.
Immediately, she bursts into noisy tears, gets up and hurries
out of the room. Consternation, except for VALMONT, who,
unperturbed, sips at his champagne,

VOLANGES
I'd better to and see what's wrong
if you'll excuse me.

ROSEMONDE
Of course, my dear.

VALMONT
I shouldn't worry, Madame. The
young have such miraculous powers
of recuperation. I'm sure she'll
soon be back in the saddle.

VOLANCES, on her feet already, acknowledges VALMONT with a
perfunctory smile, as she hurries out of the room.

INT. ANTE-ROOM NIGHT

Vv: ONT tip-toes in with his dark-lantern. He reaches
CECILE's door, brings out his key and turns it in the lock.
The door does not yield. VALMONT frowns, puzzled and tries
again.

INT. CECILE'S BEDROOM NIGHT

The door is bolted on the inside. CECILE sits at her bureau,
writing a letter, tears rolling down her face. She looks

up at the SOUND of the key in the lock, then returns with

an even fiercer concentration to her letter.

INT. DRESSING-ROOM IN MME DE MERTEUIL'S HOUSE DAY
MBRTEUIL reads CECILE's letter, a sardonic smile on her face.

CECILE (V.0.)
Who else can I turn to in my
desparation, Madame? And how can
I write the necessary words?

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TO MME DE ROSEMONDE'S CHATEAU DAY

A large and elegant carriage draws up outside the chateau.
The HEAD FOOTMAN, a silver-haired veteran, passes down the
steps through the ranks of SERVANTS, who wait at attention,
opens the carriage door, lowers the steps and remains bowed

in anticipation. Presently the MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL emerges.

French window. CECILE kneels at her feet, still distraight.

CECILE is fascinated: she looks at MERTEUIL with a kind of
wild surmise.

MERTEUIL
And now here comes your mama, so
- remember what I've said and, above
all, no snivelling.

MME DE VOLANGES arrives from the garden through the
French windows, anxiously looking at CECILE.

VOLANGES
How are you feeling now, my dear?

CECILE
Oh, much better thank you, Maman.

VOLANGES
You look so tired. I think you
should go to bed.

thing to be brought to your room.
I'm sure it would do you good.

CECILE
Well. Perhaps you're right, Madame.

mischievous glance with MERTEUIL. VOLANGES doesn't see this,
having turned gratefully back to MERTEUIL.

corridor. They're both in dressing-gowns. He opens a door
quietly.

INT. VALMONT'S BEDROOM NIGHT

VALMONT leads CECILE into the room; it's much grander
than hers, and she looks around, a little awed. Candles
burn in strategic emplacements.

VALMONT
Here, you can make as much noise
as you like.

He puts the lantern down by the bed and presses down on it.

VALMONT
And the mattress is a little
harder.

CECILE

Is that good?

VALMONT
Oh, yes, that's very good.

Impulsively, CECILE throws off her things and jumps onto the
bed. She bounces up and down experimentally and then
reaches a hand up to VALMONT.

CECILE
Come on.

VALMONT smiles and then lowers himself gently alongside
her on the bed. She grabs at his dressing-gown and he
takes her wrists, restraining her.

VALMONT
The first thing you must learn
is that there is no necessity
whatsoever for haste.

He reaches out to caress her.

Now. As with every other science,
the first principle is to make sure
you call everything by its proper :

' name.
CECILE
I don't see why you have to talk
at all.
VALMONT

vocabulary, how can you indicate
what you would like me to do or
make me an offer of something [I
might find agreeable.

You see, if I do my work adequately,
I would like to think you'll be able
to surprise Monsieur de Bastide on
his wedding night.

CECILE
Would he be pleased?

VALMONT
Well, of course, he'll merely assume
your mama has done her duty and fully
briefed you.

‘ILE bursts out laughing.

CECILE
Maman couldn't possibly talk
about anything of the sort.

VALMONT .
Ican't think why. She was, after
all, at one time, one of the most
notorious young women in Paris.

CECILE
Maman?

VALMONT
Certainly. More noted for her
enthusiasm than her ability, if
I remember rightly. There was a
famous occasion, oh, before you were
born, this would have been, when she
went to stay with the Comtesse de
Beaulieu, who tactfully gave her a
room between your father's and that
of a Monsieur de Vressac, who was
her acknowledged lover at the time.
Yet in spite of these careful
arrangements, she contrived to spend
the night with a third party.

2
CECILE
I can't believe that, it's just
gossip.
VALMONT

No, no, I assure you, it's true.

How do you know?

CECILE's jaw drops. For a moment she stares at VALMONT,
appalled. Then she bursts out laughing, her laughter
even more abandoned than before.

VALMONT
Well, we can return to this
subject later. During the
intervals.

He caresses her thoughtfully.

VALMONT
You asked me if Monsieur de
Bastide would be pleased with
your abilities; and the answer
is that even if he isn't, I don't
believe it would be difficult to
find others who would. Education
is never a waste.

He begins kissing her, his head travelling down her body.
He plants a kiss on her stomach and looks up at her.

: VALMONT
Now, I think we might begin with
one or two Latin terms.

INT. GRAND SALON EVENING

MME DE ROSEMONDE is entertaining members of the local
nobility and everyone has made an effort to do justice

to the occasion. VALMONT and MERTEUIL move through the
crowd, resplendent , conversing in an undertone, as they
acknowledge the greetings of their acquaintances. VALMONT
makes a particularly deep reverence to MME DE VOLANGES and
CECILE, at which the former smiles in queasy response.

MERTEUIL
So she let you in last night?

MERTEUIL

MERTEUIL

Where is she?
VALMONT

Can't see her at the moment.

He blows a kiss at a WOMAN, who pretends not to notice.

VALMONT
Surely I've explained to you before
how much I enjoy watching the battle
between love and virtue.

MERTEUIL
What concerns me is that you appear
to enjoy watching it more than you
used to enjoy winning it.

VALMONT
All in good time.

MERTEUIL
The century is drawing to its close.

VALMONT
I really don't want to hurry things:
Every step she tries to take away
from the inevitable conclusion brings
her a little nearer to it. And when
Bastide and Cécile are married and
Madame de Tourvel eventually collapses,
we shall tell everyone, shall we not?

Their travels have brought them back close to MME DE VOLANGES
and CECILE, whom VALMONT surreptitiously indicates.

VALMONT
Isn't it a pity that our agreement
does not relate to the task you
set me rather than the task I set
myself?

MERTEUIL
I am grateful, of course: but that
would have been almost insultingly
simple. One does not applaud the
tenor for clearing his throat.

The pure and unearthly SOUND of a soprano VOICE raised in
some religious anthem, as VALMONT and MERTEUIL join a
reluctant MME DE VOLANGES.

INT. MUSIC-ROOM EVENING

The VOICE belongs to a tall MAN of melancholy aspect: a
castrato. He stands on a dais in front of a small baroque
orchestra, singing exquisitely, the veins standing out on
his temples, to an attentive audience.

VALMONT and MERTEUIL are in the back row, watching.
Suddenly, however, VALMONT gives a quite perceptible start,
which MERTEUIL notices. She follows his eyeline.

MME DE TOURVEL,looking frail and beautiful, has entered the
room. She makes her way to an isolated seat, quite close to
the orchestra and at an angle and begins to listen.

MERTEUIL turns to look at VALMONT. He's transfixed.

Presently, MME DE TOURVEL half-turns to scan the crowd. She's
looking for VALMONT; and when she sees him she holds his gaze
and smiles shyly.

VALMONT smiles back: MERTEUIL watches him, with a trace of
alarm.

MME DE TOURVEL turns back to listen to the music.

VALMONT stares, rapt, at her profile. Then he starts again,
as MERTEUIL's hand closes on his wrist. He smiles at her
sheepishly, aware of being caught out.

MME DE TOURVEL is moved by the music. There are tears in her
eyes.

VALMONT is once again lost in contemplation of her profile.
He doesn't notice now that MERTEUIL is looking at him, her
expression considerably disturbed.

Indeed, as she turns and beckons to it, it's clear that she

has saved it for him. He arrives, acknowledging her and
kneels for a moment's private prayer.

the door.

VALMONT stops, as if surprised, and bows to MME DE TOURVEL.

VALMONT
Madame.

TOURVEL
Where are you going, Monsieur?

VALMONT
To the salon.

TOURVEL
There's no-one there. The others
have all decided on an early night.

He's following her along the corridor now, on the way to
her room.

VALMONT

I very much missed our walk today.
TOURVEL

Yes.
VALMONT

I fear with the weather as it
is, we can look forward to very
few more of them.

VALMONT
Oh, yes.

By this time, they've arrived at the door to her bedroom,
which she's opened. She hesitates in the doorway and
VALMONT decides to take a chance.

VALMONT
May I?

TOURVEL
Of course.

Trying to conceal his astonishment, he follows her into
the room.

INT. TOURVEL'S BEDROOM NIGHT

VALMONT speaks, to cover his entrance into the room, which
is similarly appointed to his own, though somehow far more
sober in feeling.

VALMONT
But, you see, within a week I
shall have concluded my business.

TOURVEL stops in her tracks, clearly affected by this news.

TOURVEL
I see.

VALMONT
Even so, I'm not sure I'll be
able to bring myself to leave.

TOURVEL
Oh, please. You must!

It's an involuntary exclamation; VALMONT knows exactly
how to capitalise on it.

VALMONT
Are you still so anxious to get
rid of me?

TOURVEL
You know the answer to that. I
rely on your integrity and
generosity. I want to be able
to be grateful to you.

VALMONT
Forgive me if I say I don't want
your gratitude. I want something
altogether deeper.

TOURVEL
I know God is punishing me for
my pride. I was so certain
nothing like this could ever
happen.

VALMONT
Nothing like what?

TOURVEL
I can't...

VALMONT
Do you mean love? Is love what
you mean?

He takes her hand. She starts, but doesn't remove it.

TOURVEL
You promised not to speak of it.

VALMONT
But I must know, I need this
consolation at least.

TOURVEL
I can't...don't you see...it's
impossible.

VALMONT
Of course I understand, I don't
want you to Say anything, but I
must know, I must know if you
love me, don't speak, you don't
have to speak. I just want you
to look at me. Just look. That's
all I ask.

Long silence. Finally, slowly, MME DE TOURVEL raises her
eyes to him.
’

TOURVEL
Yes.

They're motionless for a moment. Then. VALMONT releases

her hand and puts his arms around her. As he does so, her
eyes suddenly go dead and she collapses sideways, obliging
him to catch her. She sways in his arms for a moment, then
comes to and jerks violently away from him, running half-way
across the room. Then she bursts into tears. She stands for
a moment, sobbing wildly, then rushes at VALMONT, falls to
her knees and throws her arms round his legs.

TOURVEL
For God's sake, you must leave
me, if you don't want to kill me,
you must help, it's killing me!

VALMONT, somewhat taken aback at first by her intensity,
collects himself and lifts her to her feet. For a moment ,
they sway together in an ungainly embrace; then MME DE
TOURVEL's sobs cease abruptly and give way to chattering
teeth and almost epileptic convulsions. Startled, VALMONT
gathers her up in his arms, carries her over and deposits
her gently on the bed. The convulsions continue, her

teeth are clenched, the blood drained from her face. He
leans forward and loosens her bodice as she stares
helplessly up at him. Slowly, her features return to
normal. He looks down at her, perplexed. Her arms open,
she relaxes, her lips part. He starts to lean towards her,
then suddenly checks himself and looks away, something
almost like shame darkening his expression. Her face begins
to collapse. He looks back at her, gnawing at his lip. She
begins to go into shock again and he straightens up, moves
back across the room and pulls the bell-pull. Her sobs
drive him from the room.

INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT

As VALMONT steps into the corridor, ROSEMONDE's maid, ADELE
comes hurrying up, struggling into her dressing-gown.

VALMONT
Fetch Madame. Madame de Tourvel
has been taken ill.

ADELE hurries away and VALMONT steels himself to step back
into the room.

INT. TOURVEL'S BEDROOM NIGHT

As VALMONT appears in the doorway, TOURVEL stretches out
her hand to him. He crosses and takes it between both of
his. He stands, massaging her hand, bemused and thoughtful.
He lets go of her hand abruptly as MME DE ROSEMONDE appears,
shepherded by ADELE.

VALMONT
I heard something as I was
passing; she seemed to. be
having difficulty breathing.

ROSEMONDE
Oh, my dear, whatever is it?

MME DE TOURVEL is roused from her rapt contemplation of
VALMONT's departure. :

TOURVEL
No, no, please, I don't need
a doctor. I just...come and
sit by me for a moment.

INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT

As VALMONT moves back towards his room, lost in thought,

he hears a footstep behind him. It's MME DE VOLANGES, on

her way to investigate the disturbance. VALMONT makes an
authoritative gesture to discourage her from entering TOURVEL'
room, and she turns away, strangely confused and abashed.

INT. VALMONT'S BEDROOM NIGHT

VALMONT closes the door behind him and leans his head back
on it, completely mystified.

INT. TOURVEL'S BEDROOM NIGHT

ROSEMONDE's kindly face looks anxiously down at MME DE
TOURVEL. They're holding hands. ADELE has left the room.
MME DE TOURVEL speaks very quietly, controlling herself
with enormous difficulty.

' TOURVEL
I must leave this house. I'm
most desperately in love.

MME DE ROSEMONDE bows her head, unsurprised.

TOURVEL
To leave here is the last thing
in the world I want to do, but
I'd rather die than have to live
with the guilt. Can you understand
what I'm saying?

ROSEMONDE
Of course. My dear girl. None
of this is any surprise to me.
The only thing which might surprise
one is how little the world changes.

TOURVEL
Well, what should I do? What's
your advice?

ROSEMONDE
If I remember rightly, in such
matters all advice is useless.

TOURVEL
I've never been so unhappy.

EOSEMONDE
I'm sorry to say this: but those
who are most worthy of love are
never made happy by it. You're
too young to have understood that.

TOURVEL
By why, why should that be?
ROSEMONDE
Do you still think men love the
way we do? No. Men enjoy the

happiness they feel; we can
only enjoy the happiness we give.
They're not capable of devoting
themselves exclusively to one
person. So to hope to be made
happy by love is a certain cause
of grief. I'm devoted to my
nephew, but what's true of most
men is doubly so of him.

TOURVEL
And yet...he could have...just
now. He took pity on me, I saw
it happen, I saw his decision
not to take advantage of me.

ROSEMONDE
If he has released you, my dear
child, you must go.

TOURVEL looks up at her. Tears. begin to cascade from

the corners of her eyes.

It's to Father Anselme. She

VALMONT has run his eye over the letter.

DANCENY runs over to him and embraces him impulsively.

I was afraid I'd been a sad
disappointment to you.

On the contrary, it's you I have

DANCENY

Your aim was to revenge yourself
on Bastide. I've provided him
with a wife trained by me to
perform quite naturally services

from a professional and very
likely pregnant as well. What
more do you want?

: MERTEUIL

All right, Vicomte, I agree, you've
more than done your duty. Shame
you let the other one slip through
your fingers.

VALMONT 's expression darkens.

VALMONT

I let her go. Can you imagine?

But why?
VALMONT

I was...moved.

MERTEUIL
Oh, well, then, no wonder you
bungled it.

VALMONT
I had no idea she was capable
of being so devious.

MERTEUIL
Poor woman, what else could you
expect? To surrender and not be
taken, it would try the patience
of a saint.

friend waiting long enough.

During this exchange they have been struggling, he to
free himself, she to hang on to him. Now she collapses
into his arms and the struggle resolves into a long kiss.
Then he sweeps her up in his arms, carries her across the
room and gently sets her down on the ottoman. She bursts
into tears and clutches on to him as if she's drowning.
Eventually he speaks, his voice unusually tender.

TOURVEL
I know that woman.
VALMONT
Are you sure? I'd be surprised.
TOURVEL
She's been pointed out to me at
the Opera.
VALMONT
Yes, well, she is striking.
TOURVEL

She's a courtesan. Isn't she?

VALMONT
I suppose, in a manner of speaking...

But MME DE TOURVEL turns and begins to hurry out of the
room. VALMONT catches her arm.

TOURVEL
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

VALMONT
Of course you haven't disturbed
me, I'm overjoyed to see you.

TOURVEL
Please let me go now.

VALMONT
No, no, I can't, this is absurd.

TOURVEL
Let go!

’ :
She wrenches free and he has to put his arms round her
and pinions her to prevent her from leaving. By now,
she's sobbing blindly.

VALMONT
Let's sit down...

TOURVEL
And you will never be received
at my house again!

She struggles violently and finally goes limp. He helps
her over to a sofa and sits her down.

VALMONT

VALMONT, transfixed, as he speaks with unruffled

VALMONT
Unfortunately, I cannot unlive
the years I lived before I met
you and during those years, I
had a wide acquaintance, the
majority of whom were no doubt
undesirable in one respect or
another. Now it may surprise
you to know that Emilie, in
common with many others of her.
profession and character, is
kind-hearted enough to take an
interest in those less fortunate
than herself. She has, in short,
the free time and the inclination
to do a great deal of charity work:
donations to hospitals, soup for
the poor, protection for animals,
anything which touches her senti-
mental heart. From time to time,
I make small contributions to
her purse. That's all.

*  TOURVEL
Is that true?

VALMONT ,
My relations with Emilie have for
some years now been quite blameless.
She's even done a little secretarial
work for me. Since I now know your
feelings on the matter, I shall
take steps to ensure she is never
received here again.

TOURVEL
Why did she laugh?

VALMONT
I've no idea.

TOURVEL

VALMONT
No doubt she made what, in view
of my past, must be regarded as
a fair assumption.

MME DE TOURVEL seems almost convinced.

TOURVEL
I want to believe you.

VALMONT
I knew you were coming up, you
were announced. Do you seriously
imagine, if I'd felt the slightest
guilt about Emilie, I would have
allowed you to see her?

TOURVEL
I-suppose not.

VALMONT
No.

She looks at him, her eyes clear and candid.

TOURVEL
I'm sorry.

VALMONT flinches, a look of real guilt appearing. He
takes her in his arms and she buries her face in his chest,
weeping softly.

VALMONT
No, no, it's I who must apologise.
It was most insensitive of me.

'
MME DE TOURVEL lies in VALMONT's arms. He looks down at
her, profoundly contented.

VALMONT
I didn't think it was possible
for me to love you more, but

He breaks off, genuinely moved. MME DE TOURVEL looks up

INT. BEDROOM IN MME DE MERTEUIL'S VILLA DAY

MME DE MERTEUIL, en deshabille, sits at the dressing-
table in her suburban love-nest, reading a letter.

In the background a sleeping form, unstirring in the bed.

VALMONT (V.0.)
I have the piece of paper you
require and hope I may expect
to see you very soon.

EXT. COURTYARD OF MME DE VOLANGES'S HOUSE NIGHT

VALMONT, wrapped up against the blustery wind and wintry
rain, encounters the CONCIERGE in the courtyard. He hands
over a sum of money and the CONCIERGE admits him by a
side-door.

MERTEUIL (V.0.)
You'll be the very first to hear
when I return. In the meantime,
I hope you are not neglecting
your little pupil.

INT. CECILE'S BEDROOM . NIGHT

VALMONT lies with CECILE in her large four-poster. They
speak in whispers.

CECILE
’ But where can Danceny. be?

VALMONT
I told you, I have all my people
out looking: and no trace of him.

The door suddenly bursts open. CECILE suppresses a shriek.

VALMONT, who is nearer the door, gets up after a few seconds
and tiptoes towards the gaping doorway. No one. He closes

the door with a Sigh of relief and locks it.

VALMONT
Only the wind.

He turns back to discover that CECILE has vanished.

There's a groan from the far side of the bed. Hurrying
over, VALMONT discovers that CECILE has jammed herself
in her panic into the tiny space between the bed and the
wall. He helps her up, smiling: but CECILE looks
anguished.

VALMONT
Nothing to worry about.

CECILE
Yes there is. I'm bleeding.

EXT. ENTRANCE AND COURTYARD OF MME DE MERTEUIL'S HOUSE
NIGHT

The same windy and rainy night. MERTEUIL's carriage turns
in at the entrance and comes to a stop in the courtyard.

The PORTER emerges from his lodge with a large open umbrella
as FOOTMEN converge on the carriage.

Lurking in the archway which leads out to the street is
AZOLAN. He moves so as to stay out of sight, peering into
the courtyard to try to identify the occupants of the
carriage. After a while, he reacts, with an expression of
surprise and cynical amusement.

INT. CORRIDOR OF MIRRORS IN MME DE MERTEUIL'S HOUSE NIGHT

The house is deserted. VALMONT moves stealthily down the
mirrored corridor, surrounded and apparently pursued by his
reflections. He stops and hesitates, looking from one mirror
to another. Then he remembers and applies pressure to one,
opening it to reveal the stone spiral staircase.

INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE NIGHT
’

VALMONT closes the mirror door behind him. Pitch blackness.
He begins to ascend quickly and cautiously.

INT. MERTEUIL'S BEDROOM NIGHT

Candle-light. DANCENY lies in MERTEUIL's arms. They
haven't undressed yet. Suddenly, the cupboard door opens
and VALMONT appears, giving DANCENY a hideous shock.
MERTEUIL covers her surprise far more effectively.

VALMONT
Your porter appears to be under
the impression you are still out
of town.

MERTEUIL
I'm exhausted. Naturally I
instructed the porter to inform
casual callers that I was out.

VALMONT checks a retort and turns instead, smiling, to

DANCENY.

VALMONT
And you here as well, my dear
young friend. The porter would
seem to be having a somewhat
erratic evening.

DANCENY
Oh, well, I, erm, yes.

VALMONT
As a matter of fact, it's you I'm
looking for.

DANCENY
Is it?

VALMONT
Mademoiselle Cécile returns to
Paris after an absence of over
two months. What do you suppose
is uppermost in her mind? Answer,
of course, the longed-for reunion

_ with her beloved Chevalier.

MERTEUIL
Vicomte, this is no time to make
mischief.

DANCENY is horrified.

DANCENY

VALMONT
Calm yourself, my friend, the

on the road to recovery. But
you can well imagine how
desparate I've been to find you.

DANCENY
Of course, my God, how could I
not have been here at such a
time? How can I ever forgive
myself?

His voice trails away, as he becomes aware of MERTEUIL's
withering glance.

VALMONT
But, look, I hate to be the
bearer of bad tidings. All is
well now with Cécile, I assure
you. And I sharn't disturb you
further.

He produces a piece of paper from an inside pocket.

VALMONT
It's just that I have something
to show the Marquise.

MERTEUIL looks up sharply: he's succeeded in catching her
interest.

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE NIGHT

MERTEUIL leads VALMONT, holding his hand. At the top
of the grand staircase, he turns to her.

VALMONT
Are you sure you're not going
to impose some new condition
before you agree to honour your
obligation?

Pause. MERTEUIL considers how best to respond. Finally
she speaks with deadly precision and calm.

MERTEUIL
I have a friend, who became
involved with an entirely un-
suitable woman. Whenever any
of us pointed this out to him,
he invariably made the same
feeble reply: it's beyond my
control, he would say. He was
on the verge of becoming a
laughing-stock. At which point,
another friend of mine, a woman,
decided to speak to him seriously.
She explained to him that his
name was in danger of being
ludicrously associated with this
phrase for the rest of his life.
So do you know what he did?

VALMONT
I feel sure you're about to tell
me.

MERTEUIL

He went round to see his mistress
and bluntly announced he was
leaving her. As you might expect,
she protested vociferously. But
to everything she said, to every
objection she made, he simply

' replied: it's beyond my control.
Good night.

She flits away along the landing. VALMONT stands there
for quite some time before beginning his descent. He
walks down the stairs, his heart heavy and his head bowed.

INT. DRAWING-ROOM IN MME DE TOURVEL'S HOUSE DAY

There's a fire burning in the grate. MME DE TOURVEL
paces anxiously up and down. The door opens and the
FOOTMAN shows in VALMONT. She runs across to him,

unable to conceal her delight and, as the FOOTMAN leaves,
she buries herself in his afms. He embraces her, his
expression strained and wearv.

TOURVEL

VALMONT holds her close, his resolution ebbing away. He
kisses her lingeringly.

TTOURVEL
Is it like that for you?

VALMONT detaches himself from her, turns away, and takes

a few paces, steeling himself. Then he turns back to her,
his expression icy.

VALMONT
Yes. At this moment, for example,
I'm quite convinced I'm never
going to see you again.

TOURVEL doesn't understand: but she feels an automatic
stab of fear.

VALMONT
I'm so bored, you see. It's

VALMONT

They grapple silently and grimly for one moment, before
she screams at hin.

MME DE TOURVEL screams in anguish and collapses, falling

She bursts into tears, shaking her head and moaning
incoherently.

VALMONT

INT. LANDING AND STAIRCASE DAY

Outside the door VALMONT has stopped. He can hear the

SOUND of MME DE TOURVEL's weeping. He closes his eyes

and leans his head back against the door for a moment,

his expression tormented and queasy. Then he sets off
at a run, leaping down the stairs and out of the front

door as fast as he can.

EXT. STREET NIGHT

The VICOMTE DE VALMONT's carriage moves through swirling
fog.

INT. CARRIAGE NIGHT

VALMONT is alone, pale and preoccupied. He taps against
the partition and the carriage draws up.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO MME DE MERTEUIL'S HOUSE NIGHT

VALMONT jumps down from the carriage and calls up to the
coachman.

VALMONT
Tomorrow morning, early.

COACHMAN

He flicks his whip and the carriage moves off. VALMONT
sets off towards the entrance, a black shape cutting
through the fog.

INT. GRAND SALON IN MME DE MERTEUIL'S HOUSE NIGHT

The two fires at either end of the great room reflect

in the mirrored doors and sparkling chandeliers.

Furniture has been drawn up round the fires, forming

two islands of objects, leaving the centre of the room

a bare arena. MME DE MERTEUIL, alone in the room, sits

at a small escritoir, writing. The mirrored doors open

woman.

offers, was the determination never

War.

EXT. BOIS DE VINCENNES DAWN

There's snow on the ground: and the CAMERA PANS past bare
trees in the grey dawn light.

MERTEUIL (V.O.)
My dear Chevalier Danceny, there
is something, as I bid you farewell,
that I feel I should tell you.

The CAMERA comes to rest on DANCENY, who's in his shirtsleeves,
pacing impatiently, pulling on a leather gauntlet. Beside him
is aman in black, his SECOND, holding an épee. DANCENY takes
it from him, his breath rising on the air.

MERTEUIL (V.0O.)
It is not only that he betrayed
you with Cécile: it's the pleasure
he took in making you ridiculous.

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals the whole of the clearing, the snow
fresh, if not very deep; and VALMONT, who is calmly making
his selection from a case of épées, held open for him by
AZOLAN. He weighs now one and now the other in his hand.
Eventually he chooses one and lays it on the ground, while
AZOLAN helps him off with his coat and on with a black glove.
Then he picks up the sword and approaches DANCENY. They
take up the en-garde position. At a sign from AZOLAN, the
duel begins, fierce and determined, VALMONT's skill against
DANCENY's aggression. For some time, they're evenly matched,
with VALMONT clearly a talented swordsman, looking the more
dangerous. Indeed, quite soon, he seems to have DANCENY at
his mercy; but he turns aside at the crucial moment and
mowes away, looking surprised at himself.

INT. VALMONT'S BEDROOM DAY

As in Scene 124, VALMONT draws up MME DE TOURVEL, so that
she's lying on top of him.

MME DE VOLANGES and CECILE leave their carriage and move

MME DE TOURVEL lies in a curtained bed, deathly pale.

EXT. BOIS DE VINCENNES DAWN

VALMONT returns to the attack: they cut and parry with
immense energy. Then VALMONT skids in the snow and DANCENY,
more by luck than good judgment, succeeds in wounding him in
whichever is not his sword arm. DANCENY immediately withdraws,
according to the rules. VALMONT looks down at the wisp of
blood staining his torn sleeve.

INT. MADAME DE TOURVEL'S ROOM IN THE CONVENT DAY

The SURGEON's curved blade cuts at the vein on the inside
of MME DE TOURVEL's elbow and dark blood begins to flow
into a small siiver bowl.

EXT. BOIS DE VINCENNES DAWN

VALMONT shakes his head as if to clear his mind and resumes
the en-garde position. The duel continues. This time it's
DANCENY who looks to have the initiative. VALMONT seems to
have lost heart, or even interest; and at one point when

a too-enthusiastic attack by DANCENY leaves him wide open,
VALMONT fails to take advantage of a golden opportunity.
This seems to revive VALMONT's vigour for a moment and he
beats DANCENY back only to relent at the last minute and
turns his back on him. He moves back towards the centre
of the clearing, closing his eyes briefly.

INT. DRAWING-ROOM IN MME DE TOURVEL'S HOUSE EVENING

As in Scene 109, VALMONT kneels with his face in MME DE
TOURVEL's lap.

ExT. BOIS DE VINCENNES DAWN

VALMONT turns back to face DANCENY. Now he hardly seems to
be trying at all, simply parrying his thrusts. Then he
counter-attacks, but so rashly that he almost seems to

run onto DANCENY's blade, which enters him just below the
heart. There's a moment of mutual shock, then DANCENY
withdraws his sword and VALMONT staggers a couple of steps
before collapsing. AZOLAN hurries over to him.

VALMONT
I'm cold.

AZOLAN runs to get his coat. DANCENY turns to his SECOND.

DANCENY

The SECOND hurries away as AZOLAN drapes VALMONT's coat
around him. DANCENY stands alone, uncertain.

VALMONT
A moment of your time.

DANCENY reluctantly approaches.

VALMONT
Two things: a word of advice,
which of course you may ignore,
but it is honestly intended;
and a request.

: DANCENY
Go on.

VALMONT
The advice is: be careful of
the Marquise de Merteuil.

DANCENY
You must permit me to treat with
scepticism anything you have to
say about her.

VALMONT
Nevertheless, I must tell you:
in this affair, we are both her
creatures.

Painfully, he reaches into his coat pocket and brings out
a bundle of letters.

VALMONT
As I believe her letters to me
will prove.

He hands DANCENY the letters. After a moment's thought,
DANCENY speaks.

to me. I want you to tell her I
can't explain why I broke with
her as I did, but that since then
my life has been worth nothing.

During this, to MME DE VOLANGES's horror, MME DE TOURVEL
suddenly wrenches at the bandage at her elbow, opening
the wound and causing it to bleed again.

EXT. CONVENT EVENING

DANCENY rides ‘up to the forbidding walls of the convent
and dismounts.

VALMONT (V.O.)

you just have, my boy, and I want
you to help me withdraw it.

‘ happiness I've ever known.

MME DE TOURVEL raises a hand and DANCENY stops speaking.

TOURVEL
Enough.

She looks up at DANCENY.

TOURVEL
Draw the curtains.

DANCENY rises and draws the curtains on her bed.

EXT. BOIS DE VINCENNES DAWN
CLOSE on DANCENY: tears are rolling down his cheeks.

VALMONT (0.S.)
Will you do that for me?

DANCENY
I will.

The silence is broken by snatches of birdsong.

INT. MME DE TOURVEL'S ROOM EVENING

A NUN is lighting candles at the foot of MME DE TOURVEL's
bed. Through the curtains, her motionless shape. She's
dead. MME DE VOLANGES is by the bed. Ina corner, DANCENY
murmurs to CECILE.

DANCENY
I've made copies of her letters
and sent them to everyone I could
think of.

CECILE
Letters about me?

DANCENY doesn't answer. CECILE shakes her head.

CECILE

We made it very easy for them.
DANCENY

I'm sorry. You'll never see me

again.

He hurries from the room. The NUN draws back the curtains,
as CECILE approaches MME'DE VOLANGES.

CECILE
I went to see the Mother Superior.
I asked her to let me come back
' here. For good.

VOLANGES looks at her aghast. CECILE turns away from her
and watches as the NUN covers MME DE TOURVEL's waxen face.
EXT. BOIS DE VINCENNES DAWN

DANCENY raises a hand to brush away his tears. AZOLAN looks
over at him indignantly.

AZOLAN
It's all very well doing that now.

VALMONT
Let him be.

We see VALMONT for the first time in this scene. All
around him the snow is red with his blood. He raises
a hand towards DANCENY.

VALMONT
He had good cause. It's something
I don't believe anyone has ever
been able to say about me.

Before DANCENY can take his hand, he slumps back. He's
dead. .

INT. MME DE MERTEUIL'S DRESSING-ROOM DAY

CLOSE on MERTEUIL's face as she utters a great cry of
anger and frustration. She sweeps all her perfume-boxes
off the dressing-table. Then she smashes everything in

the room she can possibly break, ornaments, mirrors, glass
jars. She winces suddenly and looks down. She's cut her
finger slightly. The sight of her blood seems to calm her.
She looks up at the circle of SERVANTS, cowering around the
margins of the room, appalled.

MERTEUIL
Get out. All of you.

They hurry out in something of a stampede. MERTEUIL stands,
desolate in a field cf glittering debris. Her head comes
down again, contorted with misery and rage.

INT. MERTEUIL'S BOX AT THE OPERA EVENING

It's before curtain-up and MERTEUIL moves to the front of
the box to contemplate the house. Three boxes away a

dist inguished-looking middle-aged COUPLE are doing the same
thing. MERTEUIL bows to them. To her surprise, they turn
away from her, ignoring her ostentatiously. She turns to
look down at the orchestra, frowning; and becomes aware
that the crowd below are murmuring to one another and
pointing up at her. Gradually, the hum dies and there's
silence in the theatre. Everyone in the stalls is looking
up at her. Suddenly, there's a hiss and then, growing quickly
in volume and intensity, a torrent of hissing and booing.
MERTEUIL absorbs it for a moment, then turns on her heel
and, moving with deliberation and a certain dignity, leaves
the box.

INT. MME DE MERTEUIL'S DRESSING-ROOM NIGHT

Everything is back exactly as it was, leaving no trace of
MERTEUIL's rampage. She, in her négligee, sits at her
dressing-table, alone, reméving her make-up. As it comes

off, a new MERTEUIL seems for the first time to be revealed,
weary, fragile, vulnerable almost. She looks at her

reflection with the anxiety someone feels in the presence
of their only friend: and the image slowly FADES TO BLACK.

CAPTION ON BLACK SCREEN

And from then on, her soul was written on her face.
