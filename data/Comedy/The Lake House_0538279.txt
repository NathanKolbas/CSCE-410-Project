INT. CAR

Lucy takes a deep breath, then pulls away from the house.
Dog next to her in the passenger seat. She drives down
the road, gaining speed. She suddenly stops, remembering

something.

LUCY
Shit. Sorry.

She puts the car in reverse. Backs up until she is next
to the mailbox. She reaches out the window, opens the
box and puts an envelope inside. She strains to reach
the flag.

The dog watches.

She finally succeeds in pulling the flag to the upright
position.

LUCY
Okay.

She puts the car in gear. It disappears down the road.
ON the raised red flag.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
CREDITS OVER.

As Lucy drives south, the Lake on her left. She passes a
sign: CHICAGO 60 MILES.

Traffic gets denser as she approaches the city.

Soon the skyline is right on top of her and she's in it,
at the height of the morning rush -- crowds, traffic,
noise, energy.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

She pulls up outside an APARTMENT BUILDING on a densely-
packed North Side street. It's a very new building, cold
and sterile. The contrast with the tranquillity of the
Lake House is striking. She parks the car, gets out.
Takes a moment to absorb the change in her surroundings.
Then she starts to unload her things.

END CREDITS.

CUT TO:
FADE IN:
EXT. ROAD - CLOSE ON A MAILBOX - DAWN

A very ordinary one -- metal, mounted on a post, hinged
red flag on the side. The flag is down.

The SOUND of waves lapping the shore.

PULL BACK. Beyond the mailbox is LAKE MICHIGAN, endless
and blue-gray on this overcast winter morning.

And on the Lake, hugging the shore, is a LAKE HOUSE.

This house, unlike its mailbox, is striking. It’s at the
end of a narrow jetty or walkway that shoots out into the
Lake. It is perched on stilts right above the water,
where it seems to float. Its design is modern, and in
another setting it might be slightly austere, but here
the fit with its surroundings is so perfect that the
overall effect is one of serenity.

It is dawn. A smudge of sun can be seen rising in the
space between the sun and the surface of the Lake.
INT. LAKE HOUSE

LUCY FORSTER, 30, lovely, watches the sunrise through a
huge window that faces the water.

After a while and with evident difficulty, she tears
herself away. She pulls on a coat and goes to the front
door. The house is empty; Lucy is moving out. She opens
the door and takes a final look back.

Her eyes fall on someone.

LUCY
You coming or not?

A SMALL DOG is hesitating in the middle of the room.
LUCY
Last chance...
EXT. JETTY - DAWN

Lucy walks across the jetty to the road, where her car is
waiting, packed full of bones. The dog trots after her.
INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY

The corridors of a huge urban hospital, crowded with
PATIENTS, FAMILIES, ORDERLIES. It’s chaotic and loud.

Lucy comes in. She walks to the main desk, tries to flag
down a busy ATTENDANT.

LUCY
Excuse me?

ATTENDANT
Just a minute, okay?

Lucy waits for a minute, then tries to catch the
Attendant again as she blows past.

LUCY
Excuse me, I need to --

The Attendant hands her a clipboard.
ATTENDANT
Just fill this out and wait over

there for me, okay?

Lucy hands it back.

LUCY
No, I’m Doctor Forster. I’ma
new resident. They told me to

report here.

ATTENDANT
Oh, I’m sorry, Doctor. You need
to find Dr. Klyczynski. She
should be around here. Older
lady, kinda tough, like this
tall...

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

ANNA KLYCZYNSKI, 45, no-nonsense manner, walks fast down
the corridor. Lucy next to her, trying to keep up.
Klyczynski hands her a big stack of files.

KLYCZYNSKI
You’re covering 22 patients on
rounds today, this floor and the
next.

LUCY
Twenty-two?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

KLYCZYNSKI
Quiet morning. If you get into
trouble you can beep me, but try
to keep it to a minimum. The med
students are supposed to help you
out with scut work. If you can
find one.

Lucy is looking a little dazed. They pass a patient on a
bed in the corridor. Klyczynski flags down a NURSE.

KLYCZYNSKI
What’s he doing here? I ordered
an immediate MRI.

NURSE
Transport said about four hours.

KLYCZYNSKI
Shit. All right.

She turns to Lucy, takes the files back, points.

KLYCZYNSKI
Doctor Forster, push him down to
MRI -- that’s a left, another

left, a right, elevator to two,
follow the signs. Then hustle
back here for rounds...

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER

Lucy with a stack of charts, reeling around, trying to
find her next patient. She’s lost in the busy corridors.
Another young woman doctor, MADHVI PATEL, appears,
glances at her chart.

PATEL
Wrong floor.
Lucy makes a frustrated sound. Patel guides her to an
elevator.
PATEL
Takes a while to get your
bearings. I’m Madhvi. You’re

the new resident, right?
LUCY
(nods)
Lucy. Forster.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

PATEL
Where did you do your internship?

LUCY
A little community hospital. Up
on the North Shore.

PATEL
Well, just think of this as a
little community hospital, only
with more gunshot wounds.

She smiles, but Lucy doesn’t acknowledge the attempt.

INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Lucy comes off shift, very tired. Patel and another
resident, TOM COSTELLO, are changing clothes to go home.
They nod at Lucy. She smiles wearily.

PATEL

How was your first night?
LUCY

I’m... not sure.
COSTELLO

Nor should you be. A state of
dazed near-panic is normal for
the first few months.

Lucy smiles politely.

PATEL
Luckily there is a cure.
COSTELLO
The Cove.
PATEL
The Cove.
LUCY
What’s that?
COSTELLO
Bar around the corner. Open all

night. Acceptable burgers.
Cheap beer in unwashed glasses.

PATEL
It’s heavenly.

(CONTINUED)
Lucy realizes they’re inviting her to come with them.
She hesitates.

LUCY
Thanks. Better not. I’m dead.

COSTELLO
We all are.

LUCY
And I’ve still got a lot of
unpacking to do...

Patel and Costello nod. If they’re put out by her
refusal, they don’t show it.

COSTELLO
Next time, then.

INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT

Lucy comes home. Her apartment is small, sterile. She
hasn’t had time to unpack and boxes are strewn
everywhere.

As she enters, her DOG LEAPS UP on her, WHIMPERING.

Lucy jumps, startled, then puts the dog down, goes into
the kitchen and flicks the light on. Nothing happens.

LUCY
(mutters)
Need light bulbs.

She opens the (bare) fridge for the light. She pours dog
food into a bowl, emptying the bag.

LUCY
Need dog food. And human food...
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Her bedroom is as functional and depressing as the rest
of the place. A loud SQUEAK as she walks into the room.

LUCY
Fix loose floorboard.

Lucy goes to the window. Outside -- a solid wall of
other buildings, other windows. Very hard even to see
the sky. She sighs.

(CONTINUED)
LUCY
Need view.

She closes the blinds.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY
ON the mailbox, its flag still up.

FIND a PICKUP TRUCK parked at the edge of the jetty. Its
back is piled with furniture and moving boxes. A MAN is

moving in to the house. Working alone, he heaves a large
armchair off the truck and wrestles it along the jetty.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - LATER

The man plugs in a lamp and switches it on. JULIAN, 30,
tall, moody good looks.

He surveys the place, pleased. He doesn’t have much. A
stereo, some books, the armchair. But the spare
furnishings fit with the austere beauty of the house. He
looks out the window at the Lake.

INT. LOCAL GROCERY - EVENING

Julian stocks up on groceries at a local shop. The young
STOREOWNER and his WIFE behind the counter.

STOREOWNER
New in the area?

JULIAN
(smiles)
More or less.

STOREOWNER
You’11 like it. Especially
since it warms up a little.
(indicating
groceries)
Let us get you some boxes for all
that.

JULIAN
Okay, thanks.

(CONTINUED)
His wife goes to take an empty box down from a high
shelf. She is visibly pregnant. The Storeowner hurries

over.

STOREOWNER
No, honey, let me.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - EVENING

Julian pulls up with his groceries in the back of the
truck. He notices the mailbox with its raised flag. He
stops and opens it.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Julian sits in his chair by the window, silhouetted

against the moonlit Lake outside. A beer in his hand.
He opens Lucy’s letter and reads.

LUCY (V.0.)
‘Dear New Tenant. Hi and welcome
to your new home and
congratulations, etcetera. It’s a

wonderful place, as you already
know, and I’m sure you’ll love
living here as much as I did. I’m
the previous tenant by the way.

Julian looks puzzled.

LUCY (V.0.)

‘The post office is forwarding my
mail but I wondered if you could
send anything that might slip
through. My new address is below.
Thanks.’

(beat)
“P.S.’

Julian flips the letter over.

JULIAN
(reads)
‘Sorry about the paw prints by the
front door. They were there when

I moved in. Same with the box in
the attic. I think it belongs to
the owner.’

Julian stares at the letter.
10.

He goes to the front door. The floor is clean. Nothing
outside either.

INT. ATTIC

Julian opens the door to an attic crawl space. He looks
around. It’s empty. No boxes.

INT. LAKE HOUSE

Julian shrugs, crumples the letter and throws it away.

CUT TO:

EXT. EL PLATFORM (CHICAGO) - EVENING

Lucy walks up the stairs to the El, alone against the
tide of people walking down -- they are coming home from
work as she heads in for a night shift.

INT. ICU ROOM - NIGHT

An ICU PATIENT in crisis. MONITORS BEEPING and flashing
red. Lucy runs in, swiftly begins CPR, asks a nurse to

prepare a syringe.

Klyczynski appears and stands at the door, watching Lucy
closely.

KLYCZYNSKI
You all right?

Lucy keeps working. The patient’s crisis passes. The
monitors quiet.

LUCY
I think we’re okay.

Klyczynski nods.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Lucy checks on a PATIENT -- teenage girl lying awake in a
darkened room, watching TV.
LUCY
Hey. You’re supposed to be

asleep.

(CONTINUED)
11.

GIRL
I know, but --
LUCY
Sorry. Sometimes I’ve got to play

bad cop.

Lucy goes to switch off the TV. She pauses.

It’s showing Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman -- the long,
long lingering kiss from Notorious. Lucy stares at it,
transfixed.

Then she sits down on the edge of the bed to watch. The
girl looks at her, surprised.

Klyczynski nods.
LUCY
My favourite part.
INT. LUCY’S BEDROOM - DAWN
After work. Lucy prepares for bed, a blindfold around
her neck. She goes to the window to close the blinds

against the morning light.

She notices something outside. She gets up on tiptoe,
straining. Then she pulls a chair over and stands on it.

HER POV

By standing up high at the extreme edge of the window she
can just make out, through a gap in the buildings, a tiny
sliver of Lake Michigan. The sun is just coming up.

BACK TO SCENE

She stands on the chair, staring at it.

CUT TO:

INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAWN

THROUGH the Lake House window we can see the sun rising,
huge, over the Lake. Julian is up, lacing up work boots.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MORNING

Julian pulls up in his truck, arriving at a Lakeside
building site -- dozens of future condos, now mostly
foundations and a few half-finished frame skeletons.
It’s a big operation.
12.

An office set up in a large trailer on the site. Julian
prepares for the day, consulting plans and schedules.
MONA JAFFE (30s, brisk, stylish) on the phone.

MONA
That’s right, each luxury
residence has a private Lake
view... They’re not available for
viewing quite yet, but if you’d
like me to add you to the list...
yes, we absolutely expect to be
ready on schedule.

She throws a “right?” glance at Julian. He nods
reassurance.
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER
Dozens of Men working at various places around the site.
FIND Julian walking quickly, conferring with MULHERN
(40s, construction foreman, hard look).
JULIAN
I’d like to get the foundation for

number 17 dug today.

Mulhern looks at him with barely-disguised contempt.

MULHERN

I know you’re kinda new here.
JULIAN

What?
MULHERN

I can’t get to that at least ‘til
next week.

JULIAN
(smoothly)
Come on, Mulhern, that’s bullshit
and you know it. Take Clemens and

Rodriguez off roofing, Jorge can
run the backhoe they’re not using
on fourteen, and grab four or five
of the other guys sitting on their
asses on seven and ten -- Paulie,
Frank, Carlos, Danny, and what’s
his name, the tall kid, Rafael.

Mulhern blinks.

MULHERN
Right.
13.

Julian is the last man at work on the site at the end of
the day. He hauls away some garbage and scrap.

He’s about to throw out a couple of half-full cans of
paint. He stops.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - EVENING

Julian kneels on the jetty, applying a fresh coat of
paint to the weather-beaten boards. He finishes, pleased
with the result. He begins putting his supplies away.
Behind him, a small dog, a stray, trots up the road.
Julian doesn’t notice. The dog looks at the jetty for a
second, then walks right into it, into the fresh paint.
Julian sees.

JULIAN
Hey!

He tries to grab the dog but it runs down the jetty.
Julian has left the door to the house open and the dog
runs inside. Julian is about to follow when he stops
suddenly.

ON THE FLOOR going into the house is a trail of PAW
PRINTS.

INT. LAKE HOUSE

Julian digging determinedly through his garbage. Near
the bottom, he finally finds what he’s looking for:

Lucy’s note. He stares at it.

CUT TO:

INT./EXT. HOSTPITAL - DAY

Lucy heading out for lunch, her coat on. (We note the
nurse’s station is decorated with paper hearts, etc.)

As she exits the hospital, she realizes it is
SURPRISINGLY WARM. She smiles, opens her coat.
EXT. GRANT PARK - DAY

Lucy eats her lunch in the large park, the Lake on one
side, the city skyline on the other.

(CONTINUED)
14.

The park is crowded on this gorgeous day. Heavy traffic
on Lake Shore Drive beyond.

Lucy squints into the sunlight gleaming off the Lake.
Sounds nearby -- a BELL TOLLING noon. Children laughing,
yelling. A pair of OLD MEN on the next bench over.

OLD MAN
What’s with the damn weather?
60 degrees on Valentine’s Day?

OLD MAN #2
It’s global warming.
Buckingham Fountain is not far off. It sends up a huge
plume of water. Lucy gets up and starts towards it. She

runs a hand through her hair, enjoying the feel of the
sun on her face, some of the tension leaving her.

Suddenly, a horrible SOUND -- a high-pitched grinding
SQUEAL.

Lucy looks around.

A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY -- on the opposite side of the
fountain from Lucy -- a double-length city bus is trying
to stop.

It’s going quite fast even though from the sound of
things, the driver is absolutely crushing the brake.

Lucy just registers all of this -- the sound, the bus --
before she notices the MAN standing directly in the bus’s
path.

There is nothing to be done; it is inevitable and almost
immediate -- the man being struck by the bus, and his
small, distant figure arching into the air ten or fifteen
feet before crashing onto the pavement. The faint sound
of the impact reaches Lucy a half-second later, because
of the distance.

Lucy automatically pulls out her cell phone and dials.
She speaks calmly.

LUCY
We need an ambulance in Grant
Park, near Buckingham Fountain. A
bus has struck a pedestrian: Get
an EMS crew here now.

She begins running.
15.

Traffic is snarled around the halted bus. PEOPLE
gathering. Lucy runs up, starts pushing through the
crowd.

LUCY
I’m a doctor. Let me through.

She reaches the man, who is lying twisted, his face
bloody, obscured. She can’t move him because of risk of

neck injury; there’s not very much she can do except for
feel for a pulse, listen for breath.

An ambulance pulls up. Two EMTs jump out.

LUCY
Get a back board!

One does. They strap him into it, Lucy working to get a
pulse. The other EMT kneels to assist Lucy. They work
intensely for a moment. Then he shakes his head.

EMT
He’s done.

Lucy keeps working as if she hasn’t heard. The EMT puts
a hand on her shoulder.

EMT
Doctor.

Beat. Lucy finally stops.
She gets up.

The EMTs pull a gurney out of the ambulance and prepare
to remove the body.

INT. HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM

Lucy pours herself a cup of coffee. Her hands are
shaking. She takes a deep breath, willing them to stop.
They do.

Anna Klyczynski has been watching her.
KLYCZYNSKI

I heard about Buckingham Fountain.
EMTs said you fought hard for the

guy.

LUCY
Yeah, I really knocked myself out.

(CONTINUED)
16.

CONTINUED:
Beat.

KLYCZYNSKI

I had a case once. Routine heart
surgery. They invented the word
‘routine’ for this kind of
surgery. He died on the table.
His body just chose that time to
go. It was nobody’s fault, and
there was nothing I could have
done differently

(beat)
I couldn’t sleep for weeks.

LUCY
Thanks. I’m fine.

She turns to go.

KLYCZYNSKI
Lucy?

Lucy stops.
KLYCZYNSKI
You have anyone in the city? Any
friends? Family?
Lucy shakes her head.
KLYCZYNSKI
Do me a favor. On your day off,
get as far away from here as you
can. Okay? Go someplace where
you feel... most like yourself.

ON LUCY

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - MORNING

Julian, on his way to work, slips a note into the mailbox
and raises the flag.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR - DAY

Lucy driving north out of the city. The day is clear and
bright, sun gleaming on the water.
17.

INT. LOCAL GROCERY - DAY

Lucy buys lunch in the same grocery we saw before. Same
couple running the store. The Wife is behind the

counter.

She bends
up.

She recognizes Lucy.

STOREOWNER’S WIFE
Hey. We haven’t seen you for a
while. How’s Chicago?

LUCY
Okay.

STOREOWNER’S WIFE
What are you doing back here?

LUCY
Just needed to get out of the
city. When the weather’s like
this, you’ve got to.

STOREOWNER’S WIFE
I know it -- What is it, sweetie?

to pick up a TODDLER, about 2, who has just run

LUCY
Hi there.

STOREOWNER’S WIFE
Say hi.

TODDLER
Hi.

CUT TO:

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Julian, working, eating a sandwich. The day hasn’t
gotten much warmer and the wind is blowing strongly.
Mona stops by, heading to the office with her lunch.

MONA
Trailer’s nice and warm.
JULIAN
Love to. Can’t.
MONA

(looks at the sky)
God, it’s really miserable. Don’t
catch a cold or anything on me,
all right?
18.

CONTINUED:

JULIAN
(grins)
I never get sick.

She follows him as he works.

MONA
You find a place to stay yet?

JULIAN
Yeah. Just outside of town, up
the shore a little bit.

MONA
Up the shore...? I don’t... Wait,
not that house with the thing, the
walkway thing, and the stilts...

JULIAN
Right.

MONA
That’s not on the Lake, it’s in
the Lake. That place has been
standing empty for years. What
made you take that?

JULIAN
Well, I --

MONA
Oh, goddamn it.

Her high heels are sinking into the muddy ground. She
puts a hand on Julian’s shoulder as she pulls her feet

free. One shoe stays stuck. Julian gets it out for her.
MONA
Thanks.
JULIAN

Get yourself some boots.

Mona nods, smiles at him, watches as he wipes off her
shoe for her.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON

Lucy throws a stick, playing fetch with her dog on the
beach, wind whipping her hair. Sun low on the horizon.
Soon it will be time to go back, but she’s in no hurry
to.
19.

CONTINUED:

They come over a dune and the DOG BARKS.

HER POV

The LAKE HOUSE, not far off. The dog runs towards it.

BACK TO SCENE

She follows, keeping up. They approach the house. The
dog trots over to the jetty but Lucy picks him up before
he can run across.

She looks at the house for a moment. It is empty,
silent. Lucy turns to walk away.

Then she notices the mailbox with its raised flag.
Acting on an impulse, she opens it. INSIDE is a single
envelope. She pulls it out. To her surprise, it is
addressed to her.

INT. CAR - DUSK
Lucy sits parked outside the House, reading the letter.
LUCY
(reads aloud)
‘I got your note. Is it supposed
to be some kind of joke? If it

is, I don’t get it.

Lucy looks perplexed.

LUCY
‘I’m not the “previous tenant.”
There was no previous tenant. I

thought maybe you had the wrong
place. But how did you know about
the paw prints?’

Lucy is baffled. She thinks for a moment, then digs in
her bag for a pen and paper.

CUT TO:
EXT. LAKE HOUSE - EVENING
Julian pulls up in his pickup, after work. The flag on
the mailbox is up. He opens the box. Lucy’s new letter

is inside. He looks at it as he walks along the jetty.
It has a return address: 1620 RACINE.
20.

CONTINUED:
As Julian lets himself in, something leaps onto him.

JULIAN
Agh! What --

It’s the stray dog, which Julian has evidently kept. It
licks Julian’s face. (We notice, if we haven’t before,
that this dog looks a great deal like Lucy’s dog.)

JULIAN
Oh yeah. You.

He puts the dog down. He opens Lucy’s letter and begins
to read.

CUT TO:

INT. ARCHITECTURE CLASSROOM (CHICAGO) - DAY

An architecture class. A half-dozen GRADUATE STUDENTS
(black clothes, hipster/pretentious eyewear, etc.) sit
around a seminar table.

One student, HENRY FERRIS, 29, presents a project.
A severe-looking professor, BURNHAM, 60, watches.

HENRY
My project is informed and
inspired by a metaphor of the
loop, or fugue -- interlocking,
repeating patterns in time and/or
space that generate meaning and
structural complexity via their
contrapuntal interweaving and
mutual interdependence, as much as
by paradox and apparent
contradiction.

Around the table -- generally approving looks. Henry
pulls out a rolled-up poster.

HENRY
Specifically, as exemplified in
the work of M.C. Escher, in his
‘Relativity.’
He shows the Escher engraving of a dizzying building,
staircases and ramps leading around in endless,
impossible loops.

(CONTINUED)
21.

CONTINUED:

HENRY
..- which I have re-rendered and
reconceived here as a real-world
contemporary structure
incorporating offices, public
space, a food court, and a 12-
screen multiplex.

Beat. Burnham squints at Henry’s proposal.

BURNHAM
So if I understand this correctly,
you’re proposing to build this
Escher engraving.

HENRY
With some significant
modifications, but essentially,
yes.

Everyone takes this in.
BURNHAM
Interesting. I have only two

comments, Mr. Ferris.

Henry looks eager.

BURNHAM
One, this makes no fucking sense
at all. Two, the assignment was

to design a single-family home.
Don’t waste the class’s time,
Henry.

(turns to the class)
All right, who’s got something we
can build here on Earth?

EXT. CLASSROOM - LATER

Henry comes out of class, chagrined, walking with VANESSA
(another student, mousy/arty look).

HENRY
God, I mean what is the point of
putting yourself out there in the
visionary vanguard if you’re just
going to get shot down?

VANESSA
I thought your concept was really
bold.
22.

CONTINUED:

HENRY
It’s like, if you don’t take risks
as an architect, if you don’t at
least try to push the envelope,
you wind up, I don’t know,
remodeling kitchens for yuppies...

VANESSA
Exactly. I --

HENRY
(surprised)
Hey!

As he exits the building Henry sees JULIAN outside,
waiting on the plaza in front of the school.

EXT. ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL
Julian grins as Henry comes over.

HENRY
He’s back!

JULIAN
Believe it or not.

HENRY
What are you doing here? You’re
supposed to be this busy,
important man.

JULIAN
Never too busy to look up an old
friend and buy him a drink.

HENRY
I am truly touched.
JULIAN
And I had to run an errand in

town.
Henry laughs. They hug.
HENRY
It’s good to see you.
JULIAN’S POV - OVER HENRY’S SHOULDER
He sees Professor Burnham come out of the building.

Their eyes meet. Burnham freezes. Then walks on, as if
he hadn’t noticed him.
23.

BACK TO SCENE
Julian watches him go.

JULIAN
Let’s get out of here.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Crowded Chicago bar. Julian and Henry sit at a table
with burgers and beers.

HENRY
So. How’s life in condo world?

JULIAN
Well, it’s a challenge managing a
project so big, sometimes it’s
frustrating, but basically I --

HENRY
Just tell me how much money you’re
making.

JULIAN
Forget it.

HENRY
Come on, a hint.

JULIAN
I bought a house.

HENRY
That much?

JULIAN
On the Lake.

HENRY
That much? Shit.

JULIAN
Don’t worry. I’m mortgaged up to
my eyeballs.

HENRY
Still. Lake House. God. I guess
that makes selling out your dreams
and betraying your talent totally
worth it.

JULIAN
Yep.
24.

CONTINUED:
He clinks his glass against Henry’s and drinks. Beat.

HENRY
You never think about coming back
to school?

JULIAN
Never.

HENRY
You sure? You’re content just to
be this upwardly-mobile cliche.

JULIAN

Yeah.
(he drinks)
I even got a dog.

HENRY
(rolls his eyes)
Shit.
INT. JULIAN’S TRUCK - NIGHT

Julian drives around Chicago’s North Side.

JULIAN

Hank.
HENRY

Yeah?
JULIAN

Burnham ever ask where I went?
HENRY

No.

Beat. Julian is silent for a moment.

HENRY

You should have seen him rake me
over the coals today. He hates
me.

JULIAN
He doesn’t hate you.
(beat)
He hates your work...

They laugh. Beat. Julian turns a corner.
25.

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT
Julian walks down the street, looking for an address.

JULIAN
1620 Racine.

HENRY
What is it?

JULIAN
I’m not sure.

HENRY
Who lives there?

JULIAN
I don’t know.

HENRY
So why are we going?

JULIAN
I don’t know.

HENRY
Okay.

Julian crosses the street, notes an address on a
building.

JULIAN
Here’s sixteen hundred.

HENRY
So sixteen hundred twenty should be...

Henry walks to the next lot down. He is standing in
front of a PIT. Just a recently-dug foundation, no
building. They stare at it.

HENRY
So should we buzz up, or what?
Julian takes a piece of paper out of his pocket. Lucy’s
last letter. The return address is correct: 1620
Racine.
HENRY

Perhaps there has been some sort
of mistake.

Julian looks at the letter itself. It is dated MARCH 20,
2004.
26.

INT. HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

Lucy comes in, studying a new letter from Julian. We can
read the words “Mistake... tried to deliver this in
person... wrong address... also the date (?!)”

She picks up the pad and begins to write, exasperated.

LUCY (V.0.)
I got your last letter. I’m not
quite sure I’m writing back but I
guess I want to get to the bottom
of this.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT
Julian in his kitchen, reading the letter.

LUCY (V.0.)

By the way, for some reason the
mail isn’t getting forwarded to
me. I’ve had to drive up there to
get it. Anyway, no, I did not get
the address wrong. I know where I
live. Okay, it’s ugly, but it’s
not quite an open pit.

Julian smiles.

LUCY (V.0.)
And I know the date, too. It’s
2004.
He laughs. This is some sort of insane joke.
LUCY (V.0.)

Just curious: what year do you
think it is?

Behind Julian -- the calendar on his wall is open to the
MARCH, 2002 page.
INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy studies a letter from Julian. CLOSE ON the date,
underlined: “2002.”

And the words --
AND STOP BULLSHITTING ME, PLEASE.

She snorts, incredulous. The dog looks at her. She pets
it, thinking. Then she gets up.

(CONTINUED)
27.

CONTINUED:

She goes to a closet and takes down a shoebox. It’s full
of photographs.

She dumps them out and begins sorting through them.

She pauses to look at one. A younger Lucy with a
BOYFRIEND -- MORGAN, 30, slightly bland good looks.
They’re in each other’s arms, laughing, in love.

She looks at it for a second, then puts it away and keeps
searching.

She finally finds the photo she’s looking for. It shows
Lucy and some friends, outside at night, wearing T-
shirts and jeans, with snow falling around them.

She flips it over. On the back is an auto-printed date:
APRIL 3, 2002.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - EVENING

WIND BLOWING fiercely as Julian arrives home to find the
flag on the mailbox up. A new letter from Lucy inside.
He retrieves it and walks across the jetty.

INT. LAKE HOUSE

THROUGH the window we can see thick clouds collecting
over the lake as Julian reads the letter.

LUCY (V.0.)
Since you don’t believe me, a
little warning. There was a bad
flu going around in the Spring of
2002. I remember because there
was a freak late snow, and after
that everybody got sick.

Julian rolls his eyes.

LUCY (V.0.)
So, my mystery correspondent, if
you really are where -- or when --
you say you are... I hope you’re
getting plenty of rest and
drinking lots of fluids.

This is too much for Julian.

JULIAN
Snow, right.
28.

CONTINUED:

He crumples the letter and goes to throw it away. He’s
about to drop it in the trash when he suddenly SNEEZES.

It takes a second for this to register, and by the time
it does, he sneezes again. He whirls around.

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW -- beautiful SNOW is swirling into the
Lake.

EXT. MAILBOX - DAY

The mailbox is covered with a thick dusting of snow.
Julian very tentatively opens it. He quickly slips ina

letter and closes the box, almost as if he’s afraid it
will bite him. He pulls the red flag up.

EXT. MAILBOX - DAY (LUCY’S CONTINUITY)

The mailbox is dry; it’s a warm day two years later.
Lucy opens the box and takes out Julian’s letter. She
puts the flag down. She opens the letter. It has a
single line.

CAN THIS BE HAPPENING?

Lucy, hands shaking, takes out a pen.

EXT. MAILBOX (JULIAN’S CONTINUITY)

Julian stares at the snow-covered box. The flag is now
down. He is starting to look a little freaked out.
Also, he has the flu. He suddenly doubles over and
sneezes violently.

When he looks back at the mailbox, the flag is up. He
nearly jumps back in alarm.

He very hesitantly opens the mailbox and takes out... his
note. The same one he just put in. He’s slightly
disappointed, but also reassured. He relaxes a bit.

He flips the note open and his jaw drops.

Underneath his line “CAN THIS BE HAPPENING?” is Lucy’s
handwriting, a single word:

YES.
29.

INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy comes home, a little dazed. Her dog jumps up on
her. She carries it into her bedroom and sits down on
her bed.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Julian on his bed, nursing his flu, staring at the note,

still struggling to believe this. His dog jumps up and
settles into his lap.

INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Lucy on her bed, writing.
LUCY
(out loud)
I don’t know where to start.
INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY
Julian reads Lucy’s letter.
LUCY (V.0.)
I don’t even know the right
questions to ask. Is there
anything you can tell me that
might shed some light on this?
Julian thinks. He looks at the paw prints tracking into
the house.
INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy reads. CLOSE ON a line from Julian’s letter:

I THINK WE HAVE THE SAME DOG.

SAME SCENE - LATER
Lucy at her desk. She writes back.

LUCY
Does yours jump on you when you
come home and scare the shit out
of you?
30.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT
Julian reads this.

JULIAN
Yes.

He turns the page.

JULIAN
(reads aloud)
‘And does he sleep like a person?’

He looks over at his bed. His dog lies asleep on his
back, mouth open. He does look like a person. Julian
starts to laugh.

He looks back at the letter.

LUCY (V.0.)
I call him Jack.

He looks at the dog.
JULIAN
So you’re Jack.
(correcting himself,

in amazement)
You... will be Jack.

EXT. EL PLATFORM (CHICAGO) - DAY
Lucy exiting a train in the morning rush hour.
LUCY (V.0.)
Maybe we should introduce
ourselves properly.
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Lucy arrives at the hospital, signs in, gets a stack of
charts and files.

LUCY (V.0.)
I’m a doctor -- a first year
resident in internal medicine.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE

Julian directing activity and conferring with Mona and
Mulhern at the worksite.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

31.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
I build houses. I mean, I help
run a company that builds houses.

INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Lucy reads.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Okay. I’m still trying to get
this straight. If in two years
you’ll be living in an apartment
building at 1620 Racine... which
doesn’t exist yet... where are
you, uh, ‘now’?

Lucy shakes her head.

LUCY
I’m in medical school, Madison,
Wisconsin.
(she looks around,
writes)

I mean, in ‘my’ now I’m ina

hospital cafeteria in Chicago,
Illinois, but for you... Okay,
this is weird. This is weird.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ROOFTOP

Julian, on a break, scribbles on a pad.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
What’s it like in 2004?

INT. EL TRAIN CAR - EVENING

Lucy rides him from work. Train packed with weary

commuters.

INT. LAKE

LUCY (V.0.)
It’s amazing. Everyone drives
these flying cars. We all dress
in shiny metal jumpsuits. Oh, and
the Cubs won the series last year.

HOUSE - NIGHT

Julian reads, smiling.
32.

CONTINUED:

LUCY (V.0.)
Actually, nothing’s changed much.
No. Cell phones are a little
smaller...

INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy watching Back to the Future on TV. Doc Brown is
yelling at Marty McFly.

DOC BROWN (V.0O.)
(on TV)
Great Scott, Marty, do you realize
what you’ve done? You’ve upset
the entire space-time continuum!

SAME SCENE - LATER
Lucy writes.

LUCY (V.0.)
Okay. One thing worries me. What
if, in sending these letters, in
communicating like this, we
accidentally tamper with the
course of time itself, altering
human history forever in the
process?

INT. LAKE HOUSE - EVENING
Julian walks across the jetty.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
Yeah, good point. lLet’s not do
that.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
He lets himself into the house. Jack jumps up onto him.

JULIAN
Aggh!
(firm)
No.

He sets Jack back on the floor, immediately goes back
outside and comes in again. Jack jumps up. Julian puts
him on the floor firmly and holds him there.
33.

CONTINUED:

JULIAN
No.

Julian repeats this several times. Finally he enters and
Jack stays down. Julian gives him a treat.

JULIAN
Good boy!

INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR

Lucy reads the latest letter as she gets out of her
elevator.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Sorry. I did have to change one
thing.

Lucy opens the door. Jack is sitting placidly, looking
up at her.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
You’re welcome.

ON LUCY
beginning to laugh -- the first time we’ve seen her enjoy
any sort of release, and we --
CUT TO:

EXT. MAILBOX - DAY
It’s a bright, warm day. Lucy at the mailbox. She
pulls the flag upright.

LUCY (V.0.)

Thanks for the favor. Here’s one

back at you.

EXT. MAILBOX - DAY

Overcast, cold, wind. Julian opens the mailbox and pulls

something out. He keeps pulling -- it’s a long, bright
scarf. He tries it on, surprised.
LUCY (V.0.)

Put this on and don’t take it off
for the rest of the month. It’s
onna stay cold till the middle of
pril.
34.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Julian fills a cement mixer. He’s wearing jeans, work
boots, work gloves -- and the scarf. Mulhern looks
askance at him.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LUCY’S APARTMENT BUILDING/EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN

SPLIT SCREEN. Julian and Lucy both writing. Lucy on the
roof of her building, where she can see the Lake behind
the city buildings; Julian on the shore with Jack in his
pickup. It’s warmer in both continuities: Spring is
here,

JULIAN (V.0.)
If we’re going to keep doing this,
we’ve got to know more about each
other. Send me lists.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Julian in the kitchen. He has a cocktail recipe book and
has set out gin and lime juice and a cocktail shaker. He
mixes a drink as Jack watches.

LUCY (V.0.)
Okay. Let’s see. I like dogs, as
you know. Gimlets -- that’s gin

and lime juice, delicious on a
warm night. I like the Stones’

Exile on Main Street. Jane
Austen. I like... I love... my
work.

(joking)
Turnoffs: cruelty, infectious

diseases, and guys with mustaches.

Julian tastes the gimlet and smiles.

EXT. ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO - DAY

Lucy, sipping a milkshake, goes up the steps of the
museum.

JULIAN (V.0.)
For me: Milkshakes, black and
white. Money Jungle by Duke
Ellington. Cary Grant and Ingrid
Bergman in Notorious... The Art
Institute of Chicago on a quiet
afternoon.
35.

INT. ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO
Lucy stands in front of a canvas of boats on the water.
LUCY

I forgot one. I like the Lake
House.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

A MATCHING SHOT, of Julian looking at sailboats on the
actual Lake.

JULIAN
How’d you wind up living here,
anyway?
INT. LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Lucy sprawls on her bed, writing.
LUCY (V.0.)

I rented it after med school. It
was the strangest place I’d ever

seen. I couldn’t imagine anyone
building it. Or... I couldn’t
imagine building it and then not
living here. I loved the way it
sort of... hovered over the water.
I loved that jetty. I don’t know
why.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - EVENING

Sunset. Darkness falling over the water. Julian sits on
the jetty, writing.

JULIAN
You have to leave land to get to
the front door. It’s like getting
on a ship. Every time you come
home you’re embarking on a voyage.
(he winces)
Sorry. Pretentious.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Lucy writing.
LUCY (V.0.)
Don’t apologize. You can be

pretentious. You can be anything
you like.
36.

DOWN THE HALL

A small party is in progress for Costello’s birthday.
Cake and coffee, a dozen doctors talking, laughing.

After the toast, FIND Anna Klyczynski looking around.
She goes out into the corridor.

She sees Lucy, sitting alone at the end of the hallway,
deeply engrossed in her letter.
INT. TRAILER - DAY

Julian writing intently at his desk. Mona is watching
him from across the room.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. EL TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING

A few weeks have passed. WIND blowing fiercely on a late
spring Chicago day. Lucy waiting for the train on a
crowded platform. Her CELL PHONE rings.

LUCY
Hello?
(her explanation
changes)
Oh. Hi.

SAME SCENE - LATER
Lucy still on the phone. She sounds upset.
LUCY

(on phone)
Look, it’s not easy for me,

either. You know that... no, I’m
not mad that you called. I
just... I’m sorry, I’ve got to get

to work and I --
A train is approaching the station.

LUCY
I don’t think that’s a good idea.
No. Morgan, I’m saying please
don’t come down. Because we need
more time... Especially if we’re
going to stay friends. I just
don’t think we should...

The train is about to leave.
37.

CONTINUED:

LUCY
(on phone)
Look, I gotta go --

She runs for it but the doors close in her face and she
groans in frustration.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Lucy near the end of her shift, about to check out.
Madhvi Patel approaches her.

MADHVI
Lucy. I need a favor. I've got to
have the night off. Take my

shift?
LUCY
Tonight?
MADHVI
(shyly)

Please? I've got a date. He just
asked me, and I really want to.
I'll cover for you next time.

Lucy's exhausted, but she nods. She watches as Madhvi
dashes off excitedly.

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

Lucy after her double shift struggles down the street
with armfuls of groceries, Jack tugging at a leash. Car
HORNS BLARING. A BIKE MESSENGER nearly runs her down.
She looks strung-out.

EXT. MAILBOX - DAY

Julian opens the mailbox to find it empty. He's
surprised at how disappointed he feels.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Hey, pen pal. You haven't written
for awhile.

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy soaks in a tub, looking drained, reading this
letter.
38.

CONTINUED:

LUCY (V.0.)

It's been a... rough week. I
worked 30 hours straight. I
haven't been able to get away. I
can't remember the last time I
looked at the sky, or saw a damn
tree.

(beat)
It's not so bad when I'm busy.
It's when I have a minute to
breathe, to look around, that it
seems really hard. I wonder what
the hell I'm doing here, alone, in
this gray city. And I miss the
way the world looked from the
window of the Lake House.

INT. TRAILER - DAY
Julian reads this letter. Beat.

He looks out the window.

OUTSIDE are dozens of INFANT TREES waiting to be planted
on the construction site.

CUT TO:
INT. EL TRAIN - EVENING

Lucy, coming home from work on the train. Out the window
she can see it's beginning to rain. She sighs.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE SHORE DRIVE - EVENING

Julian drives toward Chicago on a cloudless evening. In
the back of his pickup truck is one of the TREES.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - EVENING

Lucy trudges down the rainy street toward her building.
A CLAP of THUNDER and the rain begins falling really
hard, sheets. She yelps and starts running for her door.

CUT TO:
39.

EXT. 1620 RACINE (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)
Julian digs a HOLE outside the construction site that
will become Lucy's apartment building. He finishes and

starts to set the tiny, fragile tree in place.

CUT TO:

EXT. 1620 RACINE (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)

Lucy is completely soaked as she runs the last few yards
to her front door. She struggles for her keys, dropping
them, growing more and more frustrated as the rain
absolutely pounds down on her, when suddenly --

IT STOPS.

She is baffled, as THUNDER and lightning continue to
crack across the sky, and indeed the rain is still
falling all around her, but not ON her.

She looks up.

Above her are the branches of a YOUNG TREE, leaves grown
thick and high enough to form a canopy swaying in the
rain just above Lucy. It wasn't there a second ago but
now it's sheltering her, and she gapes at it.

CUT TO:

EXT. 1620 RACINE (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Julian smiles as he tosses the shovel in the back of his
truck.

CUT TO:

EXT. 1620 RACINE
ON Lucy, moved, her face breaking into a wide smile.
LUCY
(quietly)
Thank you.

Drops of rain fall through the green branches as Lucy
spins slowly beneath the tree.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - DAY
40.

EXT./INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

Henry is standing on the jetty facing the Lake House. He
has just arrived.

HENRY
You... bastard...

Julian gestures for Henry to follow him inside. Henry is
too flabbergasted by the house.

HENRY
This is where you’ve been hiding
out? This is yours?

JULIAN
Yeah.

Henry follows Julian inside, appraising the place.

HENRY
When was it built?
JULIAN
Seventies. You want a beer?
HENRY
Yeah.
Henry looks around.
HENRY
It’s like Le Corbusier meets Frank
Lloyd Wright meets... me in five
years. It’s perfect.
JULIAN

Actually, it’s not.
EXT. REAR OF LAKE HOUSE

They stand on a narrow ledge that runs along the back of
the house. There’s a fifteen-foot drop down to the
water.

JULIAN
You can’t swim. There should be a
stairway down to the water. Maybe
a porch. Something.

HENRY
(shakes his head)
It would ruin the line. Total
aesthetic catastrophe.
41.

EXT. JETTY - NIGHT

They sit in the darkness, listening to the WATER LAPPING,
drinking beer. ROLLING STONES ON the STEREO inside.

HENRY
Exile. Cool.
JULIAN
Yeah.
Beat.
HENRY
Julian. I didn't just come up

here to escape my pathetic
existence in the city.

JULIAN
You didn't?
HENRY
No. There's an agenda.
(beat)

If you dropped this bourgeois
'thing' and came back we could
still graduate together in a year.
Start the Firm.

JULIAN
"Visionary Vanguard Associates.’
HENRY
Visionary Vanguard. I can't do
it alone.
JULIAN

(shakes his head)
Sorry, Hank.

Beat. Henry treads carefully.

HENRY
I'm sure if you talked to him...
JULIAN
Forget it.
HENRY
Jules.
JULIAN

He doesn't want me back. I don't
want to be back. Everybody's
happier now.
42.

CONTINUED:

HENRY
What about your work? Your work
was great. Even he admitted that.
Look, I know it's hard, but if you
suck it up and put all the
personal shit aside for a few
months, you'll have your degree,
and --

JULIAN
I said forget it.

His tone is sharp. Henry is quiet.

JULIAN
Sorry. I just... like it up here.

HENRY
Are you involved with somebody?

JULIAN
(beat)

HENRY
Why did you hesitate?

JULIAN
I didn't.

HENRY
Yes you did.

JULIAN
I -- I'm not involved with
anybody, okay?

HENRY
Okay.
(beat)
All I'm saying is, maybe you
should think about the future.

Julian starts to laugh. He can't stop. Henry looks at
him.

HENRY
What?
(as Julian keeps
laughing)
What?

CUT TO:
43.

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy has an old 2002 filofax calendar open on her desk.
She turns the pages until she sees an entry, circled:
"5:46 TO MADISON." She picks up a pen, writes.

LUCY (V.0.)
Let's try something.

EXT. AMTRAK STATION - DAY

Julian driving. He turns into the parking lot of a local
train station, parks and gets out. Rain is falling.

BEYOND, a train is just pulling into the station.

LUCY (V.0.)
Around 'your' time two years ago I
lost something. At a train
station. I was on my way back to
school and I left it on the
platform. See if you can find it
for me. I won't tell you what it
is. Then put it in the mailbox.
This is your mission if you choose
to accept it.

INT. AMTRAK STATION

Julian walks through the station. A few PEOPLE about.
He looks for single women. He doesn't see any -- just a
couple of FAMILIES, an ELDERLY COUPLE, some BUSINESSMEN.

ANNOUNCEMENT (V.0.)
Final call for the 5:46 to
Madison, making the following
stops...

Julian keeps searching. No luck.

Suddenly, THROUGH the window that looks out onto the
train platform, he sees a YOUNG WOMAN stand up and
prepare to board the train.

It's Lucy -- here two years younger, a med student.

Julian doesn't know for sure that it's her, but she could
be the person he's looking for, and she's startlingly
pretty besides. He hurries through the door out onto the
train platform.
44,

EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM

He is about to go over to her when he stops.

She has her arms around a MAN whose BACK is TO us.
They're embracing under an umbrella, saying goodbye.
Neither has noticed that Lucy has left a book on the
bench where they were sitting. Julian sees it, but it
would be awkward to go over and interrupt the kiss. He
hesitates.

The TRAIN CONDUCTOR announces final boarding.

Lucy reluctantly breaks off from the man and gets on the
train.

The man Lucy was kissing doesn't move. He stands under
his umbrella, watching as the train pulls out, and
doesn't leave until it is completely out of sight. He
never notices the book. Julian watches him go.

Once he's gone, Julian goes over to the bench. He looks
at the book Lucy left. It is a well-worn copy of
PERSUASION by Jane Austen.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Lucy driving along the lake, eager to get to the mailbox.

She passes a LAKESIDE CONDO DEVELOPMENT. It's new,
upscale, sprawling. Lucy mutters to herself.

LUCY
Tacky.

She drives on.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Lucy arrives at the Lake House and drives up to the
mailbox, eager. She opens it.

There's no book inside. Just a note. She opens it.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING JULY 4TH?

ON LUCY

She's a little disappointed.
45.

INT. HOSPITAL - BREAK ROOM - EVENING

Lucy changes clothes after work. In the b.g., Patel and
Costello are also heading out.

LUCY (V.0O.)

Going to the fireworks, I guess.
I go every year. Why?

EXT. LAKE SHORE DRIVE (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Julian drives toward the Loop, buildings glimmering in
the twilight.

JULIAN (V.0.)
What do you say we both go?

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT (LUCY’S CONTINUITY)
Lucy walks out onto crowded downtown streets.
LUCY (V.0.)
You're not asking me out, are
you?
JULIAN (V.0O.)
No, no. I just thought it might

be good to do the same thing,
that's all.

LUCY (V.0.)
The same thing, two years apart.
EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - NIGHT (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Julian has parked his truck and joined the crowds moving
down the streets.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Better than staying home.

They arrive at the SAME CORNER from different directions.

LUCY (V.0.)
Okay. Let's go to the fireworks.
SPLIT SCREEN -- they both turn the corner, in both
continuities -- and suddenly the RIVER is before them,

thronged up and down with crowds of PEOPLE gathering in
the warm summer night.
46.

EXT. CHICAGO RIVER - NIGHT (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Julian stops at an Italian sausage stand run by a VENDOR
in his 50s and an OLD MAN, the Vendor's father, who must
be at least 80. The Vendor is about to hand Julian a
sausage but his father stops him, piles some more onions
and peppers on it for Julian.

OLD MAN
Give the man his money's worth.
(to Julian)
I'm still teaching him the
business.

VENDOR
(laughing)
All right, Pop.

Julian continues down to the river.

EXT. CHICAGO RIVER - NIGHT (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)

Lucy stops at the sausage stand. The Vendor is two years
older, a bit sadder-looking. He tends the stand alone.

LUCY
One, please.

He nods, piles it high with onions and peppers.

LUCY (V.0.)
Did you go to the station? I
never got my book.

EXT. CHICAGO RIVER - NIGHT (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Julian walks through the crowds. He watches a HAPPY
COUPLE go by.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Let me keep it for a while. I
want to read it.
(beat)
There's something I've been
meaning to ask you. Who was the
guy at the train station?

EXT. CHICAGO RIVER (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)
Lucy watches a DIFFERENT HAPPY COUPLE pass (and is

surprised to see that it's Patel and Costello, holding
hands away from the hospital, furtive lovers).
47.

EXT. CHICAGO RIVER (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Julian stares up at the sky, in the middle of an
expectant crowd, waiting for the fireworks.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Your fiance? Why didn't you
tell me?

LUCY (V.0O.)
You don't tell me about your
love life.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Because I don't have one.
Unfortunately. God, I can't
believe you didn't say you're
married.

EXT. CHICAGO RIVER (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)
Lucy in her crowd by the river.
LUCY (V.0.)
(gentler)
I'm not married. We broke up when

I moved to Chicago.

CHEERS as the show begins and the first FIREWORKS
EXPLODE. She looks up at the sky.

LUCY (V.0.)
I'm alone.

EXT. CHICAGO RIVER (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Julian alone in the crowd as his fireworks show begins.

JULIAN (V .0.)
Okay. Me too.

FIREWORKS EXPLODE AND ECHO in both continuities. Julian
and Lucy watch, the lights playing on their upturned
faces.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Lucy comes home. It's a hot night and her apartment is
stifling. She gets ready for bed, stripping down to

panties and tank top, and stands in front of a fan.

LUCY (V.0.)
So. How were your fireworks?
48.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Julian strips down to boxers. He opens a window, trying
to catch a breeze on his equally hot night.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Not as good as yours, I'll bet.
They get better every year.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM/INT. LAKE HOUSE

SPLIT SCREEN -- the two of them, lying in different
halves of their beds.

LUCY (V.0.)
Yeah...

They both lie there, hot and uncomfortable, tossing in
frustration, separated by time.
INT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Then Julian jumps up. He goes to his desk and pulls out
a piece of paper. He writes:

AT THE TRAIN STATION, I...
He crosses this out and starts over.
WHEN I SAW YOU... I WASN'T EXPECTING...

He crosses this out too. Then takes a breath, and before
he can stop himself, writes:

YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE SO BEAUTIFUL.

INT. HOSPITAL - BREAK ROOM - NIGHT

Lucy reads these words. She can’t suppress a startled
little gasp. She looks around, embarrassed. No one has

No fair. You saw me but I still
don’t know what you look like.

Julian looks in the mirror, examines his hairline.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
You're right. I wouldn't mind
knowing what I'm like in two
years. Why don't you get together

with 'me' in the future and let me
know what you think?

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy considers this.

LUCY
Yeah.

She takes a breath, suddenly excited and nervous. Her
life could be about to change.

She writes:
OKAY... WHY NOT GIVE ME A CALL ON JULY 10, 2004, AT ABOUT
She checks her watch. It's 9:04. She writes.

9:05.

CLOSE ON THE TIP OF HER PEN
as it finishes the last curve of the "5" --

The PHONE RINGS.
She nearly falls out of her chair.

Lucy steadies herself. She gets up and crosses to the
phone. She hesitates, then snatches up the receiver,
heart racing.

LUCY
(whispers)
Hello?

VOICE (V.0.)
(on phone)
Lucy?

LUCY
Yes?

VOICE (V.0.)
(on phone)
It's Morgan.

CONTINUED:

It takes a moment for this to sink in.

LUCY
Morgan?

MORGAN (V.0O.)
(on phone)
Yeah. I’m in Chicago. I came
down for a meeting but it was
cancelled, so I thought I'd give
you a call. What the hell. See
if you were free.

ON LUCY

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

Lucy walks with MORGAN -- the man from the train station,
now two years older than when we last saw him, good-
looking, nicely dressed. They walk in awkward silence.

MORGAN
Thanks for coming out.

LUCY
Sure.

MORGAN
Been too long.

She doesn't answer. Beat.

MORGAN
How's Jack?

LUCY
He's good.

MORGAN

Adjusting to city life?

LUCY
Yeah, he's doing great.

MORGAN
Good. I miss him.

Beat.

MORGAN
Have you eaten, by any chance?
51.

CONTINUED:
LUCY
No, but --
MORGAN
Neither have I. I just realized

I'm starving. We could grab a
quick dinner.

Lucy nods, reluctantly. They are passing a small,

elegant restaurant -- "IL MARE."
MORGAN
How about this? Looks all right.
LUCY
Oh, no, Morgan, this place is much

too...

But Morgan is already heading inside.

INT. IL MARE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The place is small and stylish and serene. Also
absolutely packed. Morgan goes up to the HOSTESS.

MORGAN
Two for dinner.

HOSTESS
(taken aback)
Tonight?

MORGAN
Yes, please.

HOSTESS
I'm sorry, sir. We're completely
booked for tonight.
She pages ahead through the reservation book.
HOSTESS
But three... no, I'm sorry, four
months from now we have a dinner
opening if you'd like to reserve.
Five-thirty or eleven-thirty?

ON Morgan, disappointed.

INT. PIZZA PLACE -NIGHT

Bright, garish pizza place. Morgan and Lucy eat.

MORGAN
I thought you'd see me if it
seemed like no big deal, a
surprise, a quick coffee... But
coffee could turn into dinner. And
dinner could turn into...

She shakes her head.

LUCY
What?
MORGAN
Anything.
LUCY

So this was an ambush.

MORGAN
I guess so.

LUCY
Another one.

MORGAN
What do you mean?

LUCY
Morgan. You were always leaping
ten steps ahead. A week after we
met you had our whole lives mapped
out. When I was still at school,
you were picking out real estate.

LUCY (CONT'D)
I'd come visit for the weekend and
you'd have all your high school
friends, the whole town at the
house to meet me.

MORGAN
At least I didn't make out with
somebody else.

LUCY
What are you talking about?

MORGAN
At the party...

LUCY
Oh my God. I didn't make out with
him! I kissed him, once, and it
was just some random guy and it
was years ago... I can't believe
you even remember that.

MORGAN
Okay. You’re right. I don’t want
to fight.
(beat)
It’s just... part of me wonders...

if I had moved to Chicago when you
wanted to --

LUCY
You didn't.
(beat; gentler)
Leaving was the toughest decision
I've ever made. I hope you know
that.

MORGAN
Yeah.
(sighs)
I'm sorry. I never should have
called. I just... miss you.
Lucy doesn't answer. He pokes at his food, miserable.

INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

Julian is parked in his truck outside the ARCHITECTURE
SCHOOL. After a moment he gets out.

INT. ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL - BURNHAM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Burnham, the architecture professor, at work at his desk.
A SOUND at the door. He looks up.

Julian is standing in the doorway.
BURNHAM
(quiet)
This is a surprise.

JULIAN
I was in the neighborhood...

He trails off, uncomfortable. Beat.

JULIAN
How've you been?

BURNHAM
I'm well.

Burnham doesn't say anything else. Julian steps into the
room, tentative.

JULIAN
How's Margaret?

BURNHAM
She's in London for the year,
teaching. Otherwise the same.

JULIAN
You ever gonna marry her?
BURNHAM
Did you come here to make small
talk?
JULIAN
No.

Julian puts an envelope on Burnham's desk. Burnham looks
inside. A check.

BURNHAM
What is this?

JULIAN
It's what I owe you.

BURNHAM
I beg your pardon?

JULIAN
You paid my tuition for two years.

(CONTINUED)
55.

CONTINUED:

BURNHAM
So?

JULIAN
So you wasted your money.

BURNHAM
I really don't think we owe each
other anything.

JULIAN
I'd feel better.

BURNHAM
(shrugs)
If it makes you feel better.

Burnham looks at the check briefly, pockets it. Beat.

JULIAN
There's something else. I bought
the house.

BURNHAM
I heard a rumor. Word travels in
this business.

JULIAN
Yeah?

BURNHAM
Yes. They said some sleazy little
developer building McMansions up
and down the lake shore snapped it
up.

Julian stares at him for a moment. Then abruptly exits,
slamming the door behind him.

INT. BURNHAM'S OFFICE

Burnham takes out the check again. He looks at it, then
slowly tears it in half and drops the two pieces into a
wastepaper basket.

Then he opens a desk drawer and pulls out a photograph.

CLOSE ON PHOTO

It is a photo of the Lake House under construction.
Burnham stands on the jetty with a lovely WOMAN and a
small BOY, about seven. The boy points at the house, his
arms around his father's neck. Burnham holds the little
boy in his arms, smiling and happy and proud.
56.

BACK TO SCENE

Burnham looks at the photo a moment, starts to drop it in
the wastebasket as well, then decides not to. He puts it
back in the drawer.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - AFTERNOON

It is now autumn on the North Shore. Trees fiery and
gorgeous against the deep, vivid blue of the lake.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - AFTERNOON

Julian steps out the front door of a COMPLETED CONDO --
the first one to be finished. He shakes hands with
Mulhern, making a little ceremony of it. Applause from
the crew gathered around.

INT. TRUCK - EVENING

Julian and Mona sit in Julian's truck looking at the
site. Jack is in the backseat.

JULIAN
One down.
MONA
Forty-four to go.
JULIAN
We're not terrifyingly behind
schedule. Just... alarmingly.
She looks anxious.
JULIAN

It's gonna be okay. We'll catch
up. We could use a couple more
guys who know how to handle a
backhoe. And the waterline to
number fourteen needs to be

resealed...

MONA
Shut up.

JULIAN
What?

(CONTINUED)
57.

CONTINUED:
MONA
I'm kind of pissed at you, you
know.
JULIAN
You are?
MONA
I thought you were supposed to be
on top of things around here.
JULIAN
I thought I was.
MONA
Well you never noticed these.
She puts a foot up on the dashboard. She's wearing new,

rather flashy red cowboy boots.

MONA
Don't you remember? You told me
to get them.

JULIAN
Right. Right.
(laughs)
Wow. Not exactly what I had in
mind, but...

MONA
You like them or not?

He looks at them. He also can't help looking at her leg.

She grins.

JULIAN
I like them.

MONA
Good. ‘Cause I was thinking...
if you're not busy tonight, we

should --

IN THE BACK SEAT

JACK suddenly GROWLS and LEAPS out of the window. Julian

surprised.

JULIAN
Hey!

Julian scrambles out. Jack is dashing off over a hill.
Julian shouts but the dog doesn't stop. Julian takes off
running after him. Mona gets out.

MONA
Julian?
EXT. TOWN STREET
Julian chases Jack down a nearby residential street. The

dog is speedy. Julian racing to keep up.

EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Jack darts across someone's yard. Julian still chasing.
AHEAD, a MAN in his driveway is unloading boxes from his
car trunk. He sees what's happening and, quick on his
feet, manages to scoop Jack up in his arms as the dog
dashes past.

Julian runs up, winded.

JULIAN
Thanks.
MAN
No problem.
The MAN is MORGAN -- here, two years younger than we saw
him last. Julian has only seen him once before, under an

umbrella in the train station, and doesn't recognize him.

JULIAN
He's never run off like that.

MORGAN (MAN)
Gotta keep an eye on them. What's
his name?

JULIAN
Jack.

MORGAN
(petting him)
Hi, Jack. I should get one like

you for my girlfriend. She loves
dogs.
Julian notes all of Morgan's boxes -- cases of beer and
wine.
JULIAN

Let me give you a hand with that.
59.

EXT. TOWN STREET

Mona, far behind and hobbled by the boots (which are hard
to run in), stumbles down the street looking for Julian.

INT./EXT. MORGAN'S HOUSE

Julian helps Morgan carry in the boxes. Morgan is a
genial, chatty guy. Julian listening politely.

MORGAN
I do some real estate law,
contracts, wills, whatever people
need around here. Big stuff,
small stuff.

JULIAN
Yeah?

MORGAN
(smiles)
Okay, mostly small stuff. How
about you? You lived here long?

JULIAN
Just a few months. I've got a
place on the Lake.

MORGAN
Nice.

They're done. Mona comes limping up, winded.

MONA
Oh, thank God. You found him.

JULIAN
Yeah.

Morgan nods "hi" to Mona.

MORGAN
Hey, just so you don't think I'm
planning to drink all this by
myself -- I'm having a bunch of
friends over tonight. Locals.
You two are welcome to come.

Julian and Mona exchange a glance.

MONA
Thanks. We've got plans.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MORGAN

No problem. Good to meet you
anyway. See you later, Jack. Oh,
hey, Julian --

(reaches into

his pocket)
Take my card? I might be looking
to rent a place on the Lake
myself. If you hear of anything,
would you let me know?

JULIAN
Okay.

MORGAN
Thanks. I like this house, but my
girlfriend doesn't. You know how
it is.

JULIAN
Sure.

Mona and Julian start off.
MORGAN

I promised her a Lake view if she
moves here after med school.

Julian stops.

JULIAN
She's in medical school?

MORGAN
Yeah. In Madison. She comes down
on the weekends, though.

Julian stares. He finally realizes that Morgan 1s the
man who was on the train platform with Lucy.

MORGAN
She's coming in later tonight,
actually. That's why I'm throwing
the party.
Beat.

JULIAN
What time does it start?

Mona stares at Julian.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Lucy comes out after work, tired. Starts to head for the
El. Then changes her mind and stops. She reverses
direction and walks down the street until she comes to a
bar -- the Cove, the place the other doctors told her
about. She goes in.

INT. "COVE" BAR

The place is dead, mostly empty. She goes to the bar and
sits down, glum.

EXT. MORGAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Julian and Mona arrive at Morgan's house. Party in
progress inside. Cars parked in the driveway, on the
street. They start inside.
MONA

This better be good.

INT. MORGAN'S HOUSE - LATER

Morgan among his FRIENDS and NEIGHBORS, talking,
laughing.

MORGAN
You wouldn’t catch me dead in
Chicago. I grew up here. You'd
have to be nuts to live anywhere
else. I --

He stops Julian and Mona as they come in.
MORGAN
Hey! Glad you could make it.

Bar's in the kitchen...

They move through the rooms. A pretty dull crowd. Mona
gives him a "why are we here?" look.

No sign of Lucy anywhere.

They eventually sit on the couch next to DOUG and
MARJORIE, a couple in their 30s. Doug sticks out his
hand.

DOUG
Doug Ryan.

Marjorie nods but doesn't say anything. Uncomfortable

beat.
DOUG
You know anything about Earth
Sciences?

Julian shakes his head.

INT. COVE BAR - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Anna Klyczynski appears and sits down at the bar next to

Lucy. She orders a drink.

ANNA
According to most accepted social
norms a person should not drink
alone after ten P.M., unless they
have a good excuse. What's yours?

LUCY
Don't have one.

ANNA
I do. My youngest left for
college this morning. Marie.
(shakes her head )
There was this little girl
splashing around in a wading pool
in diapers in my back yard. And
now she's packing her Volvo to
drive to California. I have no
goddamn idea where the time went.

She's going to be pre-med at
Stanford.

Yeah.
Anna orders. The drinks come. Beat.
LUCY

Okay. I do have an excuse.

INT. MORGAN'S HOUSE

Julian and Mona are still on the couch with Doug and
Marjorie, looking restless. Doug is using two paper
plates to illustrate what he's saying.

DOUG
All of the Earth's continents

these plates are continually
moving and shifting...
MONA

of the side of
her mouth)
Get the coats.

JULIAN
Excuse me for a sec, Doug.

Julian gets up.

After a moment a figure carrying an overnight bag comes
into the darkened room. Lucy.

Hello?

Morgan flips on the lights. Everyone yells "Surprise,”
"Happy Birthday," etc. Someone carries in a cake blazing

Julian watches.

making a big deal out of it.
Anna looks at her.
ANNA
You keep a lot to yourself.

Oh hey. This is Julian. This
guy's gonna help us find our Lake

Hi.

Morgan sees that they're holding their coats.

MORGAN
You're not leaving?

Julian looks at them. Morgan's arm around Lucy.

JULIAN
No. We'll stay.

Mona glares.

INT. MORGAN'S HOUSE - LATER

Julian is looking for a bathroom. He passes a bedroom
door, ajar. INSIDE, Morgan is kissing Lucy. Julian
steps back quickly. He overhears:

MORGAN
Were you surprised?

LUCY
Yeah, I was. When are they going
to leave?

MORGAN
What's the matter?

LUCY
Nothing. Long train ride. I
don't know. I guess I thought we
were going to be alone tonight.

I did my internship. We were
going to live there forever. That

ANNA
What happened?

LUCY
It was his plan.

wanted it too. I don’t know.
Anyway, I ended it.

So who do you write to?

ANNA
Sorry. It's none of my business.

No. It's okay. There is
somebody.

It's kind of a... long distance
relationship.

ANNA
How long?

LUCY
Long.

ANNA
How'd you meet?

LUCY
We haven't.

ANNA
What?

LUCY
We just write letters.

ANNA
You're kidding.

Keep everything at a nice, safe

So you've really never spoken
face-to-face?

LUCY
Never.

So what are you doing here?
JULIAN
I was... hoping to meet somebody.
LUCY
Who?
JULIAN
Someone Morgan told me about.
LUCY
Ah. A fix up.
JULIAN
Kind of.
LUCY
He's always thinking ahead, our
Morgan.

So what are you waiting for?
JULIAN
I'm trying to work up my nerve.
She smiles, nods. Beat.

LUCY
So. You're going to get us a
place on the Lake, huh?

JULIAN
Yes. I am.

She's a little taken aback by the confidence of his
response.

Are you a real estate agent?

JULIAN
No. But I have a Lake House.

And you're going to rent it after
I move out.

When are you moving out?
JULIAN
I'm... not sure. I guess after

you finish med school?
She stares at him.

JULIAN
Morgan said you were in medical
school...

He trails off. Uncomfortable pause. Lucy is confused,
and Julian feels he bas lost his grip on the
conversation, if he ever had one.

LUCY
What makes you think we'd like it?
JULIAN
You'll like it.
LUCY
Can you swim?
JULIAN
Sure, I took lessons as a kid.
LUCY
No, I mean, can you swim from the
house?
JULIAN
Oh.

He laughs. She laughs too.

JULIAN
Uh no. You can't. That's one
drawback. There's no way down to
the water.

LUCY
That's too bad.

JULIAN

Yeah.

As he talks, he moves over and sits down next to her.

JULIAN

(growing more

animated)
I've actually thought -- well,
you'd have to see it, but I've
always had this idea you could
change it. Nothing major. But a
few new elements would really
transform it. A deck out back.
And some stairs.

LUCY
Stairs going down to the water?

JULIAN
Yeah. Just like a gentle slope,
curving down... So you could step
out the back door and slip into
the Lake whenever you felt like
it. Or if you just wanted to sit
out there...

LUCY
That sounds nice.

INT. MORGAN'S HOUSE

Lucy looks back at the house. Party still going strong.
She sighs.

LUCY
It's pretty late. Hadn't you
better get back in there? If
you're going to find your dream

You should.

He sits down next to her.

JULIAN
What's it about?

LUCY

It's about... waiting.

(beat)
These two people meet. They
almost fall in love, but the
timing isn't right, and they have
to part. Then, years later, they
meet again. They get another
chance. But they don't know if
too much time has passed, if
they've waited too long, if it's
too late for things to work out.

JULIAN
Sounds sad.

LUCY
It's not. Not in the end.

They're sitting quite close. She looks at him.

She suddenly inclines her head toward his and their lips
meet. A long, lingering kiss.

After a moment she breaks off.

LUCY
I don't know why I did that.

JULIAN
I'll try to explain...

He is leaning into her again when...
The door behind them OPENS and Morgan and Mona come out.

Julian and Lucy quickly separate but Morgan and Mona can
see they've interrupted something. Very uncomfortable
moment.

LUCY
Oh, Morgan, hey. Uh, Julian was
just telling me about his house.
It sounds really great.

MORGAN
(stony)
Great.

LUCY

We're, uh, definitely interested.

As the scene continues, TIME PASSES for both of them
(NOTE: we might see time lapse footage, etc.), although
we experience this exchange as a single conversation.

LUCY

But I liked you. That was our
chance. You should have told me.

JULIAN

What about your boyfriend?
LUCY

What about your girlfriend?
JULIAN

She's not my girlfriend!
LUCY

Well, he's not my boyfriend!
JULIAN

He was then! I mean, he is now.
LUCY

Your now, not mine! And maybe
‘now' would be different if you
had said something then. Maybe
now would have come sooner, or
maybe now it would be our now, not
just my now, you know?

No! I don’t!

for the dog, then notices his answering machine is
blinking. He plays the message.

HENRY (V.0.)
(on machine)
Julian. Listen. It's your Dad.

INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY

Julian rushes into the hospital. He goes to the
admissions desk.

JULIAN
I'm looking for my father, Julian
Burnham. He was admitted today.
B-U-R-N-H --

DOCTOR (0.S.)
Mr. Burnham?

Julian turns. A doctor is approaching him. Anna
Klyczynski -- here, of course, two years younger than
we've seen her before.

KLYCZYNSKI
I'm Anna Klyczynski. I'm the
attending for your father.

JULIAN
What happened? Is he okay?

KLYCZYNSKI
He's okay. Walk with me. He's
had a heart attack. Fortunately
relatively minor, and his students
got him here quickly. We're
monitoring him. We'll probably
want to keep him for a day or two.
77.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Henry is waiting outside Burnham's room as Julian walks
up. He stands. Julian and Henry hug.

JULIAN
Hank. My God. Thank you.

HENRY
Are you kidding? I'm just sorry I
had to leave it on your machine.
You all right?

JULIAN
Yeah.

Julian breaks off, readies himself to go in. He
indicates the closed door.

JULIAN
Is he sleeping?

HENRY
No.

Julian starts to go in.

HENRY
Julian. I wouldn't.

JULIAN
Why not?

HENRY
He's busy.

JULIAN

Busy? Doing what?

HENRY
Evaluating a student project.

Julian looks disbelieving. He starts to laugh.

JULIAN
Of course.

HENRY
Can't let a little coronary throw
off your whole class schedule.

Julian shakes his head.

The door opens. Vanessa comes out, carrying her
portfolio. She walks up to Henry. She looks him in the
eye.

(CONTINUED)
78.

CONTINUED:

VANESSA
He loved it.

She turns on her heels and walks away. Henry watches her
go, taken aback.

Julian lets himself into the room.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

Burnham is propped up in bed, hooked up to monitoring
machines, reading. He has a lot of work with him --
professional journals and magazines, papers, etc.

Julian walks into the room quietly, almost tentatively.
Burnham doesn't hear him at first. When he does finally
look over, he lowers his book but doesn't put it down.

JULIAN
Hi.

INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT
Julian sits at a table, writing.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
I know I haven't written for a
while. But I need to... I wanted
to tell you about my father.

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Lucy reads the letter.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
He's famous. You know his work --
he built the Lake House. He sold
it years ago, after my mother
died. I guess he was trying to
slam the door on that chapter of
his life. Of course it was my
life too. I got it back.

INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT
Julian stares at the page. Then writes another line.
JULIAN (V.0O.)

That's just one of the reasons we
don't get along.
79.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Julian brings Burnham a cup of coffee. Burnham is still
up and working.

JULIAN
I m not supposed to do this. I
had to sneak it past three nurses.

BURNHAM
It's not decaf, is it?

JULIAN
No.

Burnham takes it, sips, goes back to his reading.
Awkward beat. Julian sits. Eventually Burnham glances
over.

BURNHAM
I don't need you.

JULIAN
I'm gonna stay until your test
results come in.

BURNHAM
That's not until morning.

JULIAN
There's no point driving all the
way back up tonight.

Burnham shrugs, goes back to his reading. The silence is
deafening. Julian fidgets. After a moment he picks up
one of the architecture magazines.

JULIAN
Do you mind if I...

BURNHAM
Help yourself.

Julian sits down, glum, and flips through it.
BURNHAM

If that kind of thing still
interests you.

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT
Lucy continues reading.

(CONTINUED)
80.

CONTINUED:

JULIAN (V.0.)
I've made my share of small,
stupid mistakes in my life. But
I've made one huge, epic,
massively stupid ultra-mistake.
And that was going to architecture
school to study under the great
Louis Burnham.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Burnham is now asleep. Julian watches him breathing in
the dimly-lit room, the monitoring machines blinking
silently.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Everybody said I had his talent.
zry te learn from the old man.
Fo

ow in his footsteps -- maybe
all the anger and mistrust would
just... melt away.

Julian gently takes the empty coffee cup out of his
father's hand. He picks up the papers strewn on the bed
and stacks them neatly on the bedside table.

JULIAN (V.0.)
Right. Every class becomes a war
zone. Every dispute inflamed by
years of bitter feeling.

Julian sits, trying to find a comfortable position to
sleep in the hospital room chair. It's impossible. He
stares at the figure sleeping in the bed.

JULIAN (V.0.)

Somebody had to surrender. So I
did. I quit.

(beat)
And that is why, at the same age
when my father was embarking upon
a legendary career, I am throwing
up condos and living in the old
man's house.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

Julian looks strung-out after his night in the chair.
Burnham examines his breakfast tray, annoyed.

BURNHAM
No coffee.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

81.

JULIAN
You just had a heart attack.
Don't you think you can do without

it?

BURNHAM
Without it, I'll have a fucking
stroke.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER

Julian brings the coffee to his father's room, annoyed.

Before he

can go in Klyczynski comes out, carrying a

patient file.

Julian is

KLYCZYNSKI
There you are. Thought I'd missed
you. We were just going over his
results.

JULIAN
(disbelief)
I was coming right back. He
didn't ask you to wait?

KLYCZYNSKI
No.

JULIAN
Jesus.

really surprised and hurt by this. Klyczynski

sits him down.

KLYCZYNSKI
I'll tell you everything I told
your Dad. He's going to be fine,
as long as we do some
intervention.

JULIAN
Intervention?

KLYCZYNSKI
An angioplasty. It's quite
routine, and it should prevent a
repeat of the coronary episode.
He's agreed to schedule for
tomorrow, get it done quickly.

JULIAN
Whatever he wants.

(CONTINUED)
82.

CONTINUED:

Julian gets up and starts off.

KLYCZYNSKI
You're welcome to go in if you'd
like.

JULIAN

I've got to get back to work.

KLYCZYNSKI
Don't you want to speak with him
before the surgery?

Julian hands her the cup of coffee.

JULIAN
Just give him this. It's all he
wanted from me.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

Julian drives back up North, grim. He arrives at the
Lake House.

JULIAN (V. 0.)

I don't know what I was expecting.
I guess part of me thought, well,
Dad's in a bed in Cook County
Hospital, he's about to have
serious surgery, it might go a
little bit deeper than 'Is this
decaf?

(beat)
But of course that's not how
things work. When I quit school I
rejected everything he stood for.
That's how he saw it. So buying
this house must have seemed like a
sick joke. Maybe he was right. I
don't know and it's too late to
change things now. One thing's
for sure: if I really was hoping
for a tearful little bedside
reunion. I'm as stupid as he
thinks I am.

(beat)
Well. I seem to have poured my
little heart out here. Sorry.
Thanks for reading.

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Lucy reads.

JULIAN (V.0.)

I find myself wanting to tell you
things I've never told anyone.
Things I didn't know myself until
I wrote them down to send to you.
Maybe that's the strangest part of
all of this.

(beat)
Love, Julian.

Lucy lingers on this letter, on the last word, "LOVE."
Jack trots up and jumps into her lap. She pets him,
thinking.

CUT TO:

INT. LAKE HOUSE - PREDAWN

Jack trots over to Julian's bed. He jumps up on it.
Julian is lying awake, unable to sleep but it's too early
to get up. He pets the dog. He has an impulse to pick
up the telephone. He resists it.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - PREDAWN
Lucy comes into the hospital a bit early for her shift.

She goes to an elevator and gets in. She punches the
button for a sub-sub-basement.

As she rides down she takes out Julian's letter and
studies it.

CLOSE ON THE WORDS

"DAD'S IN BED IN COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL."

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MORNING

Burnham is on a gurney being wheeled down the corridor

Stop.
ORDERLY
What?
BURNHAM
I've decided... Before I go in I

want to make a call, please.
ORDERLY

I'm sorry, sir, I got to get you

straight into the O.R. You'll have

to do it after.

Burnham reluctantly nods.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL RECORDS ROOM

Lucy searches through endless shelves of old patient
records. She eventually locates a file labeled "LOUIS
BURNHAM.”

She spreads it open and begins paging through it. Past
test results, etc. She turns a page and stops.

A DEATH CERTIFICATE.
She looks at it, disturbed. It is signed by Anna
Klyczynski. The date given is two years earlier. Place
of death: Cook County Hospital. Cause: coronary failure
during surgery.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR
Lucy runs up to Madhvi Patel, urgent.
LUCY
Madhvi. I've got an emergency.

Take my shift.

PATEL
Now?

LUCY
I've covered for you. Please.

Madhvi nods. Lucy runs out.

Lucy drives toward the Lake House, very worried.

Julian gathers his things for work and walks across the
jetty toward his truck.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - MORNING (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)

Lucy stops in front of the mailbox and jumps out. She
shoves a note in and yanks up the red flag. She stares
at it, breathless.

LUCY
Come on.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE HOUSE (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Julian driving away. He hasn't noticed that the mailbox
flag is up. His truck recedes into the distance.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)
Lucy opens the box quickly. Her letter is stlll inside.
She bangs on the mailbox, tears of frustration in her

eyes.

LUCY
Goddamn it.

The flag stays up.

JULIAN
Yes?

KLYCZYNSKI (V.0.)

I'm afraid I have some difficult news.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - A MOMENT LATER

Julian runs to his truck and takes off. Mona sees him
dashing away. She calls after him. But he doesn't stop.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE

Julian arrives home. He is pale, stunned. He sees the
flag on the mailbox.

He retrieves Lucy's note, opens it and glances briefly at
it before letting his arm drop to his side. The note
drops, fluttering away, to land in the water beneath the
Jetty.

ON THE NOTE
The ink is smearing in the water but we can see the words

"GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL NOW - UNFORESEEN COMPLICATIONS -
YOUR FATHER...”

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE -DAY

Julian outside a chapel, in a dark suit, nodding at
MOURNERS as they file in for his father's memorial
service.

LUCY (V.0.)
Julian. I am terribly sorry about
your father.
(beat)
I knew I had to at least try to
warn you. I thought I could get

there in time. I hoped we could
change what happened.

(beat)
I was wrong. I guess these things

can't be changed.

87.

CONTINUED:

LUCY (V.0O.) (CONT'D)
If they could, then the file
wouldn't have said what it said,
so I never would have tried to
warn you... and then we'd be right
back where we are anyway. It just
goes in circles and I don't
pretend to understand it. All I
know is the shock feels fresh to
me, even though it happened two
years ago, so I can't imagine what
it's like for you.

INT. MEMORIAL SERVICE

Julian listens, blank-faced, to the pastor. MOVING OVER
the faces of the attendees, Henry and other students
among them.

FIND Anna Klyczynski sitting in the back. She looks like
she hasn't slept.

LUCY (V.0.)
These things just... happen
sometimes. I know. Last February
-- I remember it was Valentine's
Day, but it was really warm -- I
was at Buckingham Fountain. And
something happened. I won't bore
you with the details now, but it
was rough. Not like what you're
going through, but it bothered me
a lot. And a friend gave me some
good advice. She said to go
somewhere that made me feel most
like my true self.

INT. ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL - DAY

The funeral reception is being held at the school.
Examples of Burnham's work on display around the room.
Julian shakes hands with other MOURNERS.

LUCY (V.0.)
So I did. I drove to the Lake
House. And that was the day I got
your first letter.

INT. ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL - LATER

After the reception, Henry and a few other STUDENTS help
fold chairs, clean up.

LUCY (V.0.)
It's a place we both love, and
it's a place your father built, so
I hope you can find some solace
there.

FIND Julian sitting alone before a large photo of the
Lake House, looking lost.

INT. ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO - CLOSE - THE SAME PHOTO
on the page of a book held by Lucy.

LUCY (V.0.)
And I hope that whatever separated
you will come to seem less
important, and perhaps, in time,
disappear.

She is in the architecture section of the Art Institute
bookshop. She takes the book to the front to pay for it.

LUCY (V.0.)
Yours, Lucy.

P.S. About the book.

EXT. LARE HOUSE - DUSK

Julian at the mailbox. He holds the book that Lucy has
sent to him, along with the letter we've been hearing.

LUCY
It won't be published for a year
or two, so don't show it to
anybody. But I thought you should
see it.

Julian opens to the first page. The title is LOIUS
BURNHAM - LIFE WORKS. The publication date is 2004.

Then he notices that Lucy has marked one page. Julian
turns to it.

It’s the photo of Julian at age 7 with his parents on the
jetty of the Lake House.

Julian stands on the jetty, staring at the photo.

Julian perches on the back ledge in the fading daylight,
his feet dangling.

The sketch pad is on his lap but be hasn't drawn

Julian has written in charcoal "I WANT TO MEET YOU. FOR

CONVERSATION.

How?

JULIAN
Pick a place. I'll be there. I

years.

JULIAN
I don't care. I'll wait. Go to

but I'll be there.

Hostess (here two years younger than we've seen her
before). She leafs through the reservation book.

HOSTESS
Well, I'm sorry, but we just
received our fourth star and I'm
afraid a reservation at this time
will be extremely difficult. When
were you hoping to dine with us?

JULIAN
Two years from tomorrow.
September 15, 2004.

The Hostess blinks. She closes the book.

HOSTESS
We should be able to accommodate
you, sir.

the nurses' station and starts for the locker room, eager
to leave.

Klyczynski comes running up.
KLYCZYNSKI

Lucy. We never got daily bloods
from the floor.

LUCY
What? The interns were supposed

KLYCZTI/SKI

The interns screwed up. Listen,

done pretty fast...

Lucy nods, rushes off.

Lucy waits on the platform for the train home, late,
impatient.

LUCY
Come on, shit...

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She enters in a hurry, runs to the bedroom throwing off
her clothes.

Jack is watching her. She notices him. She takes a deep
breath.

LUCY
He's waited two years. What's
another half-hour. Right?
She continues her preparations,
but at a calmer pace.

EXT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy exits her building. She looks spectacularly elegant
and beautiful.

EXT. IL MARE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lucy approaches the restaurant. She stops before she
goes in. She's ready: excited but calm, confident. She
opens the door.

INT. IL MARE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As she checks her coat she scans the room. There aren't

many tables. Before she can locate Julian the Hostess
comes up to her.

HOSTESS
May I help you?
LUCY
Yes. I have a reservation.

Forster. Or Burnham, I'm not sure
which name it's under.

The Hostess examines her book.

HOSTESS
Oh! Yes! You're the...

Follow me.

INT. IL MARE DINING ROOM

Lucy is shown to a table for two. It's empty. She is a
little surprised.

HOSTESS
I hope you'll forgive me, but I
can't help asking...

LUCY
Yes?

HOSTESS

(eager)
This reservation is sort of...
legendary. It's been here longer
than-most of the staff. There’s
always been intense speculation
about who made it, and why, and if
you'd actually show up. Some of
the crew even have bets going...

Lucy looks around. WAITERS all over the room are
sneaking glances at her. CHEFS and BUSBOYS peering out
from behind the kitchen door. Lucy suddenly feels very
self-conscious.

HOSTESS

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
I'll send the waiter for your
drink order right away.

INT. IL MARE DINING ROOM - LATER

A WAITER pours Lucy a glass of champagne.

Good luck.

Her glass is empty. She is still waiting, alone at the
table. The Waiter comes over to refill her glass, but
Lucy stops him.

Hours have passed. OTHER DINERS are lingering over
dessert, coffee, chatting intimately across the candlelit
tables.

Lucy still is alone.

After a long moment she pushes her chair back and gets
up. Everyone is watching her, grave.

She makes her way to the front, expressionless. She
collects her coat, not speaking to anyone.

She exits. The Hostess watches her go.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Lucy walks home, alone. Her stoic facade begins to
crumble. Tears in her eyes.

She hangs up her dress in the closet and shuts the closet
door.

LUCY (V.0.)

No, Julian... You don’t
understand. It’s too late. It
already happened.

(beat)
I’m not upset. Well, I was at
first. But now I just feel
stupid -- for forgetting how much
a person's life can change in two
years. And for expecting yours
not to change. For expecting you
to wait -- to run in place, to
put your life on hold, for me.

EXT. LAKE
Julian throws stones into the Lake, frustrated.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
But I can do it. I can wait for
you. I know I can. I wouldn't

just forget...

INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM
Lucy changes into her scrubs.

LUCY (V.0.)
Maybe you did. Maybe wherever you
are 'now,' you're busy, and happy,
and living so fully in the present
that the dinner date you made two
years ago just... slipped your
mind. The way we forget
impossible fantasies when we
outgrow them, when we get on with
our real lives.

INT. TRAILER - DAY

Julian broods over this letter. Mona is at her desk,
looking at him with longing. She looks away when he
glances over.

JULIAN (V.0O.)
Are you saying I should get on
with my real life?

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Lucy wheels a PATIENT -- a pretty WOMAN, 30s, being
discharged. She thanks Lucy, effusive, then turns to

distant trees. Julian tries to follow. He slips on the
ice.

By the time he gets to his feet Jack is nowhere to be
seen. Julian wheels around, upset. The dog is really
gone.

Julian is about to call him again when he suddenly stops.
A realization dawns on his face.

INT./EXT. TRAILER - DAY

Mona's red cowboy BOOTS CRUNCH through the SNOW as she
heads for the trailer.

As she walks in, Julian is filling a cardboard box,
clearing out his desk. She stares at him. After a
moment:

JULIAN
We're on schedule. We're ahead
even. The crew know the job
backwards. It would take a major
earthquake for you not to finish
on time and you're not going to
have a major earthquake.

MONA
How do you know that?
JULIAN
I know.
(beat)
I've got to go.
Beat.
MONA
Is it the job? Or me?
JULIAN
Neither. I'm sorry, Mona.

(CONTINUED)
101.

CONTINUED:

MONA
I don't get it. Why now?

JULIAN
It's just time.

MONA
You sound so sure.

Julian nods.

MONA
Well, shit, Julian.

She sits down, unhappy. Beat. She suddenly grabs her
boots and yanks them off.

MONA
These were so fucking
uncomfortable.

She mock-throws them at him. He dodges, smiles. She
can't help smiling back.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

Julian methodically and determinedly packs up the house.
He tapes together cardboard boxes and throws his
possessions in. He bags garbage and sweeps and mops.

In the course of his work he finds a stack of Lucy's

letters. He looks at them for a moment, then bundles
them up and buries them deep in a cardboard box.

INT. ATTIC

He carries the box into the attic and seals it.

INT./EXT. MORGAN'S LAW OFFICE - DAY

Morgan in his storefront law office. Outside, Julian
pulls up in his truck. The flatbed is piled with his
possessions. Morgan comes out. He recognizes Julian
from the party, and doesn't look happy to see him.

JULIAN
Still want to rent a Lake House?

Julian tosses him a set of keys. Morgan looks stony. He
throws them back.

(CONTINUED)
102.

CONTINUED:

JULIAN
It's what Lucy wants.

MORGAN
How the hell do you know?

JULIAN
Trust me.

Julian hands him the keys. They look at each other.

EXT. MORGAN'S LAW OFFICE - LATER

Morgan watches Julian drive away. He's taken the house.
He pockets the keys and turns to go back inside.

Something catches his eye.

IN THE DISTANCE

A DOG is ambling slowly down the street, looking cold and
lost and forlorn. It's Jack.

ON Morgan.

DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE - MUSIC OVER

As TIME PASSES in BOTH CONTINUITIES.

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)
Winter. Julian unloads his truck and moves in with Henry
in Henry's ramshackle Chicago apartment.

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)

Morgan moving into Lucy's small apartment, unpacking.
Lucy clears space in her closet for his clothes. He goes
to her and they kiss.

EXT. ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Henry graduates from school. Julian 1s there to

congratulate him. Vanessa is also graduating. Henry
moves to congratulate her. They look at each other.
103.

INT. ARCHITECTURE CLASSROOM (JULIAN’S CONTINUITY)

Autumn. ARCHITECTURE STUDENTS taking notes. FIND Julian
among them; he is back at school. He takes notes as a
PROFESSOR lectures.

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)

Lucy goes through her closet, putting away summer
clothes, taking out sweaters. She comes across the dress
she wore to meet Julian. She stares at it, then shoves
it to the back of her closet.

INT. PARTY - NIGHT (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)
Winter. Lucy at an upscale NEW YEAR'S EVE party. Morgan
joking with a group of annoying lawyers. Lucy looks

bored. It's midnight. Everyone celebrates. Morgan
turns to Lucy and kisses her.

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)
Julian at a New Year's party. Scruffy student crowd. At
midnight, everyone embraces. FIND Henry and Vanessa
kissing, in love. Julian, alone, looks out the window as
fireworks go off in the distance.

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY (JULIAN'S CONTINUITY)

Winter. Julian walking down the street toward the
architecture school, a portfolio under his arm. It's
cold. He pulls his scarf tighter around his neck. It's

the scarf Lucy gave him.

He passes a Chicago row house.

EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (LUCY'S CONTINUITY)

The same house. It now has a "FOR SALE" sign in front.
Morgan walks up the steps.

END MONTAGE.

INT. BROWNSTONE

Morgan goes inside. The house is empty. It's a solid
old place but badly in need of renovation. Lucy is
already here. They walk through the echoing rooms.

(CONTINUED)
104.

CONTINUED:

LUCY
What do you think?

MORGAN
This is what I gave up lunch for?

LUCY
I know it needs work.

MORGAN
It needs a hell of a lot of work.

LUCY
I found an architect who
specializes in renovations. I
made an appointment for tomorrow.

He looks at her.

MORGAN
Ambush.
She smiles.
LUCY
We can't stay in my apartment.
It's been almost a year. I want

to keep moving forward.
He nods.

CUT TO:

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT

Julian comes home. Henry, wearing a coat and tie, is
slumped on the couch. He looks discouraged. Vanessa
consoling him.

JULIAN
How'd it go today?

HENRY
No one's hiring. Or at least no
one's hiring me.

VANESSA
Give it some time.

HENRY
I have.

(CONTINUED)
105.

CONTINUED:

JULIAN
Hey. As soon as I graduate we
start the firm. Remember?
Visionary Vanguards?

Henry nods, dejected.

INT. JULIAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Very late. Julian is bent over his drawing board,
working intently. Henry passes the open doorway. He
looks in.

HENRY
All-nighter?

Julian looks up, self-conscious.
JULIAN
Oh. No. This is just... my own

thing.

Henry moves to look at Julian's work. Julian tries to
hide it.

HENRY
Let me see.
JULIAN
It's nothing.
HENRY
Come on.
Julian relents.
ON HIS SKETCH
It is THE LAKE HOUSE -- but re-imagined. There's a deck
running along the back, and stairs curving down to the
water --t he stairs Julian described to Lucy. There are
trees planted along the jetty, and lights glowing in the
trees. The house is just as striking as before, but much

less stark, much warmer, romantic.

BACK TO SCENE
HENRY
(beat)
I like it.

(CONTINUED)
106.

CONTINUED:
JULIAN
You do?
HENRY
Yeah.
JULIAN
I didn't think you'd approve.
HENRY
The old house is a place you go to
be alone. This one, you bring
somebody to.
Julian nods. Henry looks at him.
HENRY
(quietly)
Who is she?
ON JULIAN
Beat.

JULIAN
Lucy. Her name was Lucy.

BACK TO SCENE
HENRY

When you were living there?
Julian nods.

HENRY
I knew it. What happened?
JULIAN
I lost her.
HENRY
How?
JULIAN
It's hard to explain. Mostly it
was... bad timing.
HENRY

You miss her?
Julian can only nod. Beat.

(CONTINUED)
107.

CONTINUED:

HENRY

Get her back.
JULIAN

It's too late. Or too early...
HENRY

What?
JULIAN

Nothing.

(shakes his head)
I don't even know where she is.
Even if I did, I can’t just walk
up to her and say, 'Hey, here I
am, let's pick up where we left
off.’

HENRY
What have you got to lose?
ON JULIAN
doubtful.

CUT TO:

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Morgan buried under piles of work. Lucy clicking through

channels on the TV. She comes across a station showing

the Grant/Bergman kiss from Notorious. She holds on it.
MORGAN

Hey, could you turn that down a
little, babe?

Lucy clicks OFF the TV, annoyed, and goes into the
bedroom.
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As she walks in, the FLOORBOARD SQUEAKS. She stops, then
tests it with her toe. It SQUEAKS again.

She bends down to examine it and finds that it lifts up
quite easily.

Lucy pulls the floorboard back. To her surprise, there's
a space underneath. She reaches down into it.

(CONTINUED)
108.

CONTINUED:

She pulls out a package wrapped tight in dusty plastic.
She opens it. It is her copy of PERSUASION.

ONE PAGE is marked by a ROSE, now dried and withered by
time. She opens to the page. A sentence is underlined.

"There could have been no two hearts so open, no
tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison."

She stares at it, her breath catching in her throat.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ARCHITECTURE FIRM - DAY

An overcast winter day. Lucy waits in the cold outside a
converted loft building. Morgan arrives and they go in
together.

As they do, they pass a SIGN with a logo that consists of
TWO INTERTWINED V'S.

INT. ARCHITECTURE FIRM - DAY

Lucy and Morgan wait in a loft space. The offices look
sort of makeshift. Morgan looks around.

LUCY
It's a new firm.

MORGAN
I'm sure they're very good.

LUCY
While we're waiting.

She hands him a card.

LUCY
Happy Valentine's.

MORGAN
Lu. Thanks. Oh God, I didn't get
you anything -- I've been so
swamped...

LUCY
It doesn't matter.

A RECEPTIONIST approaches them.

(CONTINUED)
109.

CONTINUED:

RECEPTIONIST
Doctor Forster? They're ready for
you.

They follow her back to a conference area.

CUT TO:

EXT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Henry and Julian coming out in their winter coats.
Henry's dressed for another job interview, Julian going
to school. As they emerge out onto the street they
realize it is surprisingly warm.

HENRY
Hey.
JULIAN
What is this?
HENRY
(shrugs)

Global warming.

CUT TO:

INT. ARCHITECTURE FIRM

Lucy and Morgan wait in the conference area. The door
opens and an architect comes in.

HENRY -- now two years older, professional.
HENRY
Hi. Henry Ferris. Sorry to keep
you waiting. I'm sort of the

number two man here. The boss'1ll
be here any second.

Lucy and Morgan nod. Then after a moment the door opens
again. They look up.

VANESSA enters -- now sleekly dressed, confident,
assertive.

VANESSA
Dr. Forster? Hi, we spoke on the
phone. Vanessa Vanderbeck.
Welcome to Vanderbeck and
Associates.
SAME SCENE - LATER

They examine sketches for the remodeling. Morgan looks
unhappy.

HENRY
so that's basically what we're
picturing.
MORGAN
It's kind of... out there, isn't
it?
VANESSA

This is the direction Lucy said
she was looking for.

LUCY
I love it. I think it's great.

Morgan glares at her. She shoots a look back.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

Julian and Henry open their coats as they walk in the
warm weather.

JULIAN
You want to grab a beer after your
interview later?

HENRY
Can't. Taking Vanessa out for
Valentine's.

Julian keeps going for a few more steps. Then he stops.

JULIAN
What?

HENRY

What? She's my girlfriend. Is
that strange?

Julian looks around. The warm day. PEOPLE on the street
enjoying the sunshine.

Julian turns back to Henry, a strange look on his face.

JULIAN
What is the date?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

HENRY
Valentine's Day. It’s February
14, what do you mean?

JULIAN
February 14. 2004.
HENRY
Yes. What is the matter with you?
JULIAN
(slowly)

She told me about today.

HENRY
Who? You mean the girl?

JULIAN
Yes! There's a letter that says
where she's gonna be.

HENRY
She wrote to you?

JULIAN
Yeah. I could see her today. You
said it last night -- what have I

got to lose?

HENRY
What are you waiting for?

JULIAN
I've just got to find the letter!
Julian runs back to the house.

CUT TO:

INT. ARCHITECTURE FIRM - DAY

Their meeting concluding, Lucy and Morgan shake hands
with Vanessa and Henry.

VANESSA
Well, terrific. We'll draw up
some preliminary blueprints and go
from there.

LUCY
Great.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

VANESSA
Henry, can you make sure they have
everything they need from us?

HENRY
Yes, of course.
VANESSA
Good. We'll be in touch.
She exits. Henry walks Lucy and Morgan out.
HENRY
So, how long have you lived in
Chicago?
LUCY
Well, I've been here about two
years...

As they walk, they pass a series of framed PICTURES on
the wall. We see several of Henry's old Escher prints...
and then, finally, something else. It is JULIAN'S LAKE
HOUSE DRAWING. Lucy doesn't notice it.

CUT TO:
INT. JULIAN'S ROOM
Julian rummages madly through his things. He can't find
Lucy's letters anywhere. Then he remembers where they

are. He runs from the room. The LAKE HOUSE DRAWING
flutters to the floor in his wake.

CUT TO:

INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE
Lucy and Morgan pull their coats on, preparing to leave.

Lucy suddenly freezes. She is staring across the loft.
She has noticed the Lake House Drawing.

She slowly crosses the room until she's standing in front
of it. She stays there, absolutely riveted, not
speaking.

MORGAN
Lu?

Henry is nearby talking to a co-worker.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

LUCY
(softly)
What is this?

Henry looks over. He clears his throat.
HENRY

This? Uh, this was done by a
friend of mine.

LUCY
Who?
HENRY
Julian Burnham.
LUCY
Julian...
HENRY
Yes.
(off her look)
Did you... did you know him?
LUCY
Yes. He -- Where is he? Do you
know how I could get in touch with
him?

Henry looks stricken. Beat.

HENRY

I'm sorry. You don't know?
LUCY

What?
HENRY

He died. Two years ago.

ON LUCY

Beat.

BACK TO SCENE
HENRY
(realizing)

Two years ago today, actually,
There was an accident...

Lucy tries to take this in.

(CONTINUED)
114.

CONTINUED:
LUCY

(whispers)
Where?

EXT. STREET - DAY

It has begun to rain. Lucy runs out _of the firm and to
her car. Morgan is behind her, bewildered, trying to
keep up.

MORGAN
Lucy! Wait! What's going on?

LUCY
It's an emergency.

MORGAN
Are you going to the hospital?

She looks at him. She touches his face, gently.

LUCY
No... I'm sorry.

She kisses him, quickly, upset, then jumps to her car and
races away. Morgan watches her go.

CUT TO:

INT. TRUCK - DAY

Julian driving North out of the city. Bright sun. He's
eager, excited. He accelerates, passing traffic.

CUT TO:

INT. LUCY'S CAR - DAY

Lucy driving North out of the city, frantic, RAIN
POUNDING onto her WINDSHIELD. She weaves in and out of
lanes, passing cars, driving recklessly, as fast as she
can.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

Julian pulls up outside the Lake House. It's shut,
empty. He runs across the jetty and unlocks the front
door.

CUT TO:
EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

Lucy arrives at the House and SKIDS to a stop in the rain
in front of the mailbox. She pulls out a pad and begins
writing, desperately.

CUT TO:
INT. LAKE HOUSE - ATTIC
Julian runs up to the attic. Inside is the single box he
stored there when he moved out. He tears the box open
and rummages through it. He locates the bundle of Lucy's

letters. He shuffles through them and finds the one he's
looking for. He reads it.

CLOSE - THE LETTER

Lucy's writing: "LAST FEBRUARY -- I REMEMBER IT WAS
VALENTINE'S DAY, BUT IT WAS REALLY WARM -- I WAS HAVING
LUNCH AT BUCKINGHAM FOUNTAIN...”

BACK TO SCENE

JULIAN
Buckingham Fountain.
CUT TO:
EXT. LAKE HOUSE - MORNING
Lucy finishes the note and jumps out of the car. She
shoves it into the mailbox and raises the flag. She

stands there, clutching the box, the rain soaking her.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE HOUSE

Julian jumps into his truck. He pulls away quickly from
the Lake House. He passes the mailbox. The flag is up.
We can SEE the raised flag in his REARVIEW MIRROR...

And we ---

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GRANT PARK - DAY

FIND Lucy finishing her lunch in the Lakefront park, not
far from Buckingham Fountain, on this unusually warm day
-- February 14, 2004.

She squints into the sunlight gleaming off the Lake. A
pair of OLD MEN on the next bench over.

OLD MAN #1
What’s with the damn weather? 60
degrees on Valentine’s Day!

OLD MAN #2
It's global warming.

The FOUNTAIN sends up a huge plume of water. She begins
walking toward it.

EXT. LAKE SHORE DRIVE

Julian can see the fountain from inside his truck. He
drives down Lake Shore Drive, looking for a parking
space. He eventually finds one and jumps out. He begins
jogging toward the park.

And we HEAR --

LUCY (V.0.)
Dear Julian. I know now -- it was
you at the Fountain that day. It
was you in the park. Please don't
go. Something terrible happens if
you do.

Julian continues jogging toward the Fountain.

He stops. There are two lanes of heavy traffic in front
of him. He searches in the distance, looking for Lucy
beyond the WHIZZING TRAFFIC, among the crowds in the
park.

LUCY (V.0.)
Please don't look for me.

He finally spots her -- a distant figure, walking on the
other side of the fountain. He smiles.

LUCY (V.0.)
Don't try to find me.

We see the two of them, no longer separated by time, only
by distance.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
LUCY (V.0.)
Don't run to me.
A break in the traffic. Julian has a clear view of Lucy

straight ahead of him.

LUCY (V.0.)
Do you understand? Please. You
have to wait.

Julian steps off the curb.

A BUS turning off Lake Shore Drive is heading right for
him.

LUCY (V.0.)
Forget everything I said before.
We both have to wait.

The DRIVER sees Julian and crushes his foot onto the
brake.

LUCY (V.0.)
If you love me -- and I love you,
I do, it has taken me all this
time to say it but I do love you -
- wait for me.

ON LUCY

Alarmed, turning as she hears the SQUEAL of the bus'
BRAKES.

LUCY (V.0.)
Wait with me. Wait until time
catches up with both of us and we
can be together. Please. Just...
Wait.

BACK TO SCENE

The bus is bearing down fast on Julian, who is staring
straight ahead at Lucy.

LUCY (V.0.)
Wait...

CUT TO:
Lucy 1s soaked, dissolved in tears at the base of the
mailbox.

LUCY
Wait. Wait...

She weeps.
A long, bitter moment. The RAIN continues to POUND DOWN.

Finally she stops, having given up hope, and tries to
collect herself. She starts, very slowly, to get to her
feet.

ON THE MAILBOX

Its flag is down.

BACK TO SCENE

Lucy is stunned. She very slowly reaches up and pulls
open the mailbox door. She almost can't bear to look
inside.

Her letter is gone.

CUT TO;

EXT. GRANT PARK - DAY

Julian is standing in the road, straining to see Lucy.
The bus is right on top of him.

At the last second he steps back onto the curb, safe.

ON LUCY

As she watches the bus proceed without incident down the
road. Except for the fact that the squealing sound has
stopped, it has no significance for her, and she turns
back to continue her walk.

BACK TO JULIAN

As the bus passes harmlessly in front of him.

MOVE DOWN. His hand is at his side, clutching Lucy's
letter.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

He looks at her writing. The words "WAIT, WAIT."
He looks into the distance as...

ACROSS THE PARK

Lucy checks her watch. Her lunch break is over. She
pauses for one last glance at the shimmering Lake, the
sun soaked park, then turns and heads quickly back toward
downtown.

Julian wants, desperately, to step off the curb again and
run to her. But he doesn't. He folds the letter. He
puts it in his pocket and slowly, with great difficulty,
turns and walks away.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE HOUSE

Lucy staring into the empty mailbox, her face soaked by
tears and rain.

A HAND reaches from behind her and gently closes the box.
She slowly turns.
Julian is two years older but mostly unchanged. He

stands quietly, looking at her, holding the now-worn
letter she just posted.

They just look at each other for a moment. Then he takes
a step towards her. He smiles, shyly.
JULIAN

Have we waited long enough?

She just stares at him for a moment, trying to convince
herself this is real.

LUCY
(whispers)
Yes.

Then they fall into each other’s arms.

When the kiss finally ends, he takes her hand. They
turn.

Lucy gasps.
ANGLE ON THE LAKE HOUSE

It has been transformed. In the two years that has
passed in Julian's life -- the life she saved -- he has
transformed it. It's now his drawing come to life -- the

warmer, romantic house with the deck, and the stairs to
the water that they talked about, and the trees planted
along the jetty, lit and glowing in the rain.

She laughs, astonished. He smiles. They take hands and
kiss again.

Then they walk slowly across the jetty and toward the
house together.

FADE OUT.

THE END
