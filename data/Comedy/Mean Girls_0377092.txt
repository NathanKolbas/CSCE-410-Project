FADE IN:
INT. CADY'S ROOM. EARLY MORNING,
There are boxes around the undecorated room. The clock says 6:29 am.

CADY HERON, 15, lies in bed asleep. She is naturally pretty. Her
long hair has never been dyed. Her eyebrows have never been plucked.
Shehas a fantastic tan.

The clock hits 6:30 and the alarm goes off. Cady opens her eyes.
CADY
(groggy)
Okay, I’m up.

Cady closes her eyes for what seems like a second. When she opens
them again, the clock says 7:15.

Cady screams and jumps out of bed.
INT. HALLWAY.- A FEW MINUTES LATER.

khaki bucket. hat. Her mom rushes by her. ” .

You're gonna be late. Come here. -

I'll braid your hair.

INT. CADY’S KITCHEN. A PEW MINUTES LATER.
The kitchen is full of boxes. Cady (hair french-braided) pours two
bowls of cat food. Two cats come running. They hiss at each other.
CADY .
Cleo, be nice! Pamela! Stop it!
While the cats are fighting, a big droopy dog strolls in behind them.
CHIP (0.8.)

Come out front, Cady. I wanna get a
photo.

Cady is still wrestling with the cats.
CADY
Stop fighting. There‘s enough for
everybody. —
gady puts the cats by their bowls, but the dog has eaten all their
ood.
CADY
Why don’t you fight with him?
The dog’s slobbering face.

EXT. FRONT OF CADY’S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.

Cady’s father CHIP, 43, a lanky professorial type, takes a picture of
Cady and her mother BETSY, 43. (Betsy is attractive but not concerned
with style. The kind of woman who would still wear a fanny pack.)

CHIP
That's good. Stay close.

Betsy bursts into tears.

BETSY
My baby’s going to school.

Cady comforts her mother.

_ CADY (V.0.)}
I guess it's natural for parents to
ory on their kid’s first day of
school. But this usually happens when
the kid is five.

Betsy has pulled Cady close and is hugging her.
CADY (¥. 54

Namibia.

Chip is cooking dinner. Cady hands him her math paper.
CADY (V.0.)
My favorite subject was always math.

CHIP
You‘re done with this chapter already?
Okay, let's start on those, um,
inverse functions. Jeez.

CADY (V.0.) |

Cause with math you're either right or
wrong. There’s no in between. ich

Chip climbs down to give Betsy a hug and a kiss.

Cady's parents drive her to school in their mud-covered Africa jeep.
CADY (V.0.) .

Evanston was a lot like Africa.

Except in every single way.
They pull up across the street from Evanston High School.

CHIP
IT know you’ll make us very proud.

BETSY
Are you nervous? It’s okay to be
nervous. I’m nervous for you. But
nervousness is perfectly nervous.
Nervous. Nervous. Nervous. Nervous.

. CADY~ o
Okav. I'll see you at home.

Cady starts across the street. She is almost hit by a big yellow
school bus. She jumps back as her mother yelps.

BETSY
Aaah!
CADY
I'm okay. Sorry. I'll be careful.
Cady crosses the street. Hip hop blares from a car radio.

Cady passes the different groups outside the school. A group of
black students sitting on @ grass.

CADY
Hi.
They just stare at her. Cady keeps walking.
A bunch of jocks fake fighting. Some people getting high behind a

tree. An overweight girl eating Egg McMuffins in secret in her car.
Cady has nowhere to land.

INT. HOMEROOM. A FEW MINUTES LATER.

Students are filing in. Cady approaches the teacher to introduce
herself.

Hi, I don’t know if anyone told you

KRISTIN HADLEY a big thick athletic gizl about six feet tall sits
down. She immediately leans over and starts making out with the boy
next to her who is very tiny and looks Like Oliver Twist. They go at
it hard.

Cady watches in horror for a second, then moves to a front row seat.

JANIS
Don't sit there.

Cady looks at her.
JANIS
Do xen want to carry attendance sheets
to the office every day?
Cady moves to a third chair.

JANIS
No.

Cady stops. Janis points to the guy in front of Cady. -

JANIS
He farts a lot.

Cady looks at the guy. He looks like a guy who would fart a lot.
She gets up and sits next to Janis.

CADY
Thanks.

DAMIAN
Did you go to St. Ann‘s last year?

CADY
_No.

DAMIAN. .

layed Sandy in their production of

CADY
Wasn’t me.

DAMIAN .
Thank God. She had pitch problems.

JANIS
This is Damian. He's almost too gay
to function.

Damian smacks Janis across the back of the head.

CADY -

A OBNOXIOUS GUY passes.

OBNOXIOUS GUY

Nice wig, Janis. What's it made of?

JANIS

Your mom’s pubic hair.

MR. DUVALL, the African American 10th grade dean enters. He looks
around for the homeroom teacher.

MR. DUVALL
Where’s your teacher?

Their homeroom teacher, MS. SHARON NORBURY, enters, She is hip-
looking, 32. Bright but maybe not the most organized teacher.

MRS. NORBURY
Okay , I’m late so I brought donuts.
(sees Mr. Duvall)
Oh, hi, good morning. -

MR. DUVALL
(to class).
All right. I just want to let
everyone know that we have a new

CADY

Oh, that‘s me. It's pronounced like
Katie.

They all look at her, disinterested.

MR. DUVALL
My apologies. JI have a nephew named
Anfernee and I know how mad he gets
when I call him Anthony. Almost as
mad as T get when I think about the
fact that his name is Anfernee.

MS. NORBURY

DAMIAN

JANIS and DAMIAN plop down on the grass.
CADY
Where’s the back building?

JANIS
It burned down in 1987.

The late bell rings.

CADY
- Won’t' we get in some sort of trouble
for this?

JANIS .
If you show up late, yes.

| DAMIAN,
But if you just don't show up at all,
they’ll never even notice.

A thick-set gym teacher with a thick blond moustache, Coach Farr, is

in front of a class.

COACH FARR

Don’t have sex. Cause you will get

Ohi! Spring Fling.

_ JANIS
Spring Fling is not important.

DAMIAN

It is to me. At the end of every

ear, the graduating seniors throw a
aencd called Spring Fling for the
underclassmen. Whomsoever is elected
Spring pling King and Queen
automatically become head of the
Student Activity Committee and since I
am an active member of the Student
Activity Committee, I would say, yeah,
it's pretty important to me.

Damian, you’ve out-~gayed yourself.

Damian sees a gym class trudging cut onto the field.

DAMIAN .
In the name of all that is holy. Look
at Karen Smith's gym clothes.

We see Karen Smith, 15, a tall stunning blonde with a vacant
expression. Her clothes consist cf the tiniest shorts ever
forged by man, and a bandanna for a shirt.

CADY
Is that a shirt or a bandage?

JANIS (0.C.)

that Karen Smith is one of thé cumbest
girls you will ever meet. Damian sat
next to her in English last year.

DAMIAN (0.C.}
She asked me how to spéll orange.

Janis, Damian and Cady start walking back toward the school.

CADY
Why do you hate them?
JANIS
What do you mean?
CADY
You seem to really hate them.
JANIS
Yes. What’s your question?
CADY
Did they do something to offend you?
JANIS
They're Rlastic. There's nothing they
do at doesn’t offend me.
Janis tears a page out of her notebook.

Brees: Asian nerds. Etc. In one corner it says "Beware of the

Janis notices the P.E. teacher has left her bullhorn by the side of
the field.

JANIS

Damian snags the bullhorn as they pass. Right as they get to the

A girl intervenes. This is REGINA GEORGE, 15. Perfect jooking, fast

Two big athletic guys (SHANE OMAN and another dude) sweep in and pick
Regina up onto their shoulders, Regina waves at people as they carry
her toward a make-shift stage in thé corner of the cafeteria.

MR. DUVALL .
Everybody, please give a round of |
applause for last year’s Spring Fling
Queen. She kicks off her’ reign today
as head of the Student Activities
Committee. Miss Regina George!

Applause. Regina, now wearing a tiara, takes center stage and the
mic. She's very comfortable. Cady is in awe.

REGINA . :
Thank you, Mr. Duvall. I just want To
say that under my rule, the S.A.C..
will do more than just sell gangy
canes and sponsor queer stuff like
recycling.

A “orunchy” boy in an Earth Day shirt looks offended.

Lake Michigan Dinher Cruises,

But also it's gonna be about building
bridges. And being kind to the less
fortunate. Where’s that little girl I
just met? . .

Regina spots Cady in the crowd.

REGINA
Come here.

Cady reluctantly goes to the foot of the stage. Regina outs a hand
on her shoulder. “Damian and Janis watch from the other side of the
cafeteria, stunned and horrified.

REGINA
This girl is a new student and I'm
‘going to make it my personal
responsibility that by the end of the

We always vote before we ask someone
to eat lunch with us, because you have
to be considerate of the rest of the

first if it looks good on you.

CADY
I wouldn‘t?

GRETCHEN
And then he broke up with her for no

reason.

KAREN .
Because she cheated on him.

GRETCHEN
Regardless. Ex-boyfriends are off

will tell Regina what you said.
It‘ll be our secret.

Regina enters with her food. (Cheese fries and two diet cokes)
