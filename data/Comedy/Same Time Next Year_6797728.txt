SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR

FADE IN
OMITTED 1
EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTLINE - SUNSET 1-A

Pounding surf. Rocky cliffs. Twisted cypress. The horizon
is ablaze with reds and golds. A small cottage stands in
silhouette against the falling sun. The front door opens.

A man exits. We will come to know him as George. He is
pulling on a sport jacket, lifting the collar up against the
ocean breeze. He walks up a rolling lawn toward a large
parn-like building surrounded by tall pine and eucalyptus
and a cluster of cottages. Lights are on and smoke drifts
out of chimneys.

OMITTED 2
EXT. COAST ROAD AND INN SIGN - SUNSET 2-A

A 1948 Kaiser approaches. Headlights on. It passes the sign
then backs up and turns into the entrance. The sign reads:
SEA SEKADOWS INN - NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S OLDEST - EST. 1844.

OMITTED thru

EXT. SEA SHADOWS INN -- SUNSET 7

The Kaiser pulls into the small narking area joining several
other cars that are mostly late-forties models sprinkled with
one or two 1950's and 51's. A young woman gets out of the
Kaiser. We will come to know her as Doris. She is dressed

in a simple suit worn over crinolines and topped by a nert
straw hat.

As she straightens her skirt and reaches into the car for her
bag and gloves, George turns the corner and heads for the
Inn's front door. The entrance lamps are on. Doris follows,
buttoning her coat against the chill.

INT. INN - FOYER - SUNSET 8

George enters holding the door for Doris. She steps in, a
smile and a nod say thanks. George closes the door and moves
past her. She stands there uncertain,

Chalmers, a man about fifty, is behind the desk. He greets
George with a wave. George waves back. As he heads toward
the dining room, he pauses at a magazine rack, flips through
several, picks a Saturday Evening Post. He is wearing a
wedding ring.

ANOTHER ANGLE - DORIS 8-A

She rubs her hands together. She is wearing a wedding ring.
She goes to the desk. Chalmers looks up. Doris asks a ques~
tion and he indicates a door off the foyer. Doris again smiles
her thanks and enters the powder room.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 12
George is seated alone and is the only one in the room. A
few people are having cocktails in the bar beyond. A fire-
place glows in the adjoining reading room. It is all quiet,
sedate.
George is restlessly turning pages and toying with his shrimp
cocktail. As he glances at his watch, something catches his
eye.
HIS POINT OF VIEW - DORIS 12-A

She is standing at the entrance to the dining room peering in,
tentative and uncertain. Chalmers comes to her and places her
at a corner table. A waiter delivers a menu. She studies it

intently, removing her gloves.

ANGLE - GEORGE L2-B

His steak is delivered and he seems to concentrate on it.
Salt. Pepper. Butter for the baked potato. Again -- he looks.

ANGLE - DORIS 12-c

She is still reading the menu. The waiter stands, pad and
pencil waiting. She closes the menu. Orders coffee, The
waiter leaves.

ANGLE - GEORGE - NIGHT 12-p

He goes back to his meal, slicing the steak. It is all metic-
ulous, a special routine, full of nervous energy. Again -- a
look.

ANGLE - DORIS - NIGHT 12-E

She picks up the menu again. We get the feeling she is deal-
ing with the prices, and it is confirmed when she checks the
money in her purse. She drops it suddenly as the waiter re-
turns and pours her coffee. She catches George watching her
and turns away.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GEORGE AND DORIS - NIGHT 12-F

Embarrassed, he looks away. She studies menu again, looks up,
catches him again. This time she offers him a shy, tentative
smile. The waiter returns to her table ready to take her
order. She indicates all she wants is coffee and hands him
the menu. As the waiter moves away, George, on an impulse,
calls him over, whispers something in his ear. The waiter
looks surprised, glances over his shoulder at Doris, looks
back at George. George nods, and then, afraid he will change
his mind, quickly buries himself in his magazine.

ANGLE ON KITCHEN DOOR 13

The waiter enters carrying a plate containing a sizzling steak,
French fries, etc., moves to Doris, places it before her. Sur-
prised, she looks at food, protests. The waiter indicates
George. By now some other diners have entered the restaurant
and Doris has to look past a couple who are seated between

she and George. George raises his fork with a piece of steak
on it in the form of a toast. Doris starts to giggle.

ANOTHER ANGLE ~- MONTAGE SHOT 14

George is now seated at Doris' table. Their attitudes are
rather formal, overly polite. They listen to one another
too attentively in the manner of strangers. The restaurant
has acquired some more diners and is now perhaps half-filled.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MONTAGE SHOT 15

George has made Doris laugh and she touches him in an impul-
sive, unselfconscious gesture. The restaurant has started
to empty and there are only a few diners left. The candle
on the table is half-burned down.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MONTAGE SHOT 16

George and Doris are alone in the restaurant. We see a feeling
of intimacy between them as they listen and talk, totally
wrapped up in each other. The candle is burned down.

INT. READING ROOM - INN - NIGHT 17

Doris is seated on a two~seater sofa across from George, who (X)
is sitting opposite her. A small table between them holds

their coffee. He loosens his tie as he talks. In the b.g.

the fire burns brightly.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MONTAGE SHOT 18

George is now seated on the corner of the coffee table talking
intimately to Doris, who has her shoes off and has her feet
curled up under her on the sofa. In the b.g. the fire has
half-burned down.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MONTAGE SHOT 19

George is now seated beside Doris on the sofa, his shoes off,
his arm resting on the back of the sofa, almost encircling
Doris. The fire has burned down to embers. They are not
talking any more, simply gazing at one another.

EXT. SEA SHADOWS INN - NIGHT 20

George is slowly walking Doris to her car. He opens the door
for her, she gets in, but he doesn't close the door. They
talk, reluctant to part. Finally, she starts the ignition.
He closes the door. They look at one another.

in bed as he slowly wakes up. He senses something is ~- well,
“different." It is at this point he notices the Female arm
across his chest. He is instantly wide awake.

As the angle widens we see that Doris is asleep in bed beside

him. Very carefully he removes her arm and gets out of bed.
He is wearing boxer shorts.

The camera stays with him as he moves away from the bed and
stops as he takes the clothes strewn all over the room. They
include the rest of his clothes, and her blouse, skirt, stock-
ings, bra, girdle and shoes. He shuts his eyes and mutters a
silent "Jesus Christ." He then picks up one sock, puts it on,
then puts on his sports jacket.

ANOTHER ANGLE - DORIS 22

She is sitting up in bed, watching him. She speaks with a
forced gaiety.

DORIS
That's a real sharp-looking outfit.

He whirls to look at her.

GEORGE
(finally)
Uh -- hello.

Doris reaches for her petticoat which is on the dressing table
stool beside the bed. She pulis it under the sheet and puts
the sheet over her head while she wriggles into her slip.

Meanwhile, George has found his trousers and quickly puts them
on.

DORIS
What time is it?

GEORGE
My watch is on the bedside table.

She picks up watch, looks at it.

DORIS
(surprised)
Ten to twelve!
GEORGE

No, it's twenty-five after cight.
The stem is broken. It's three
hours and twenty-five minutes fast.

GEORGE
No, I'm very quick with figures.

He has been staring at her.

DORIS
Why are you looking at me like
that?
GEORGE
(anguished)
Why do you have to look so
luminous!

She doesn't understand. He paces away.

GEORGE
I mean it would make everything
so much easier if you woke up
with puffy eyes and blotchy skin
like everyone else.

DORIS
(cheerfully)
I guess God figured, chubby thighs
were enough.

He fixes her with an earnest look.

it.

Dorothy, sit down.

She opens her mouth to speak.

GEORGE
Please -- sit.

She moves to a chair, sits with the sheet wrapped around
her. He paces for a moment, gathering his thoughts before
he turns to face her. When he speaks it is with great sin-

cerity.

GEORGE
Dorothy, first of all, I want you
to know last night was the most
beautiful, wonderful, crazy thing
that's ever happened to me and

I'll never forget it -- or you.
DORIS
Doris.

GEORGE
When?

It was -- you know -- in the middle

He fixes her with a burning look.

GEORGE
(intensely)
It was incredible, wasn't it?

DORIS
It was -- nice.
(sensing he expects
something more)
Especially the last time.

GEORGE
(anguished)
I know -- I'm an animal!

He throws the shoe he is holding into the sofa, moves
away to look out of window. She takes this opportunity
to gather up some of her clothing.

GEORGE
I don't know what got into me.
I just -- what was the matter

with the first two times?

. DORIS

What? Oh -- well the first time
was kinda fast and the second --
look, I feel funny talking about
this.

GEORGE

It was a very beautiful thing,
Doris. There was nothing disgust-

GEORGE
She knows already.
DORIS
(puzzled)
You said she was in New Jersey.
GEORGE
(gloomily)

It doesn't matter. She knows.

DORIS
How?

He chooses not to answer this, fixes her with his intense
stare.

GEORGE
Was it as incredible for you as
it was for me?

DORIS
(curiously)
Do all men like to talk about it
a lot afterwards?

GEORGE
(defensively)
Why? You think I'm some sort of
pervert or something?

DORIS
No, I just wondered.

GEORGE

.Oh, I'm sorry.

She gets skirt during following while he puts on his shoes.

DORIS
That's okay. Harry and me
would've gotten married anyway.
It just speeded things up a bit.
(brightly)
Turns out I get pregnant if we
drink from the same cup.

He turns to look at her, pales a little.

DORIS
What's the matter?
GEORGE
(quickly)
It's okay. Trojans are very
reliable.
DORIS

GEORGE
I think I love you.

She doesn't really want to hear this at this moment so she
gives him an uncertain smile and, her clothes in her arms,
exits into the bathroom. Caught up in his own thoughts,
without realizing what he is doing, George follows her.

INT. BATHROOM - INN - DAY 23
Pairly small, old-fashioned, no shower.

GEORGE
It's crazy! It's really crazy!
I mean I don't even know if you've
read 'Catcher in the Rye!'

She is looking around for somewhere to put her clothes.

DORIS
I never even finished high school.

GEORGE
(wildly)
You see? I don't even care! And
I'm really a snob about education!

 

She is putting her clothes in a pile on the floor. He sits
disconsolately on the side of the tub.

GEORGE (Cont'd)
Of course I should have known this
would happen. When it comes to
life I have a brown thumb. Nothing
I do ever turns out right.

DORIS
How do you mean?

GEORGE
The first time I had sex, I was
eighteen years old. We were in the
back seat of a parked 1938 Dodge
sedan. Right in the middle of it
we were rear-ended.

DORIS
(sympathetically)
Oh, that's terrible. Did you have

insurance?

making love?

She shakes her head.

GEORGE
‘If I Knew You Were Coming I'd Have
Baked A Cake!'

DORIS
(puzzled)
- SO?

GEORGE
So that's going to be ‘our song.'
Other people would get 'Be My Love’
or 'Some Enchanted Evening.' Me --
I get 'If I Knew You Were Coming
I'd Have Baked A Cake!'

She is staring at him.

GEORGE
What is it?

DORIS
I -- uh ~- want to take a bath,
George.

GEORGE

(realizes where
is he; embarrassed)
Oh, I'm terribly sorry!

He quickly exits. She looks in mirror, gives a small,
incredulous shake of her head.

George, now more or less dressed, is sitting on a chair
against the wall behind the bathroom door.

GEORGE (Cont'd)
I really think I've fallen in love
with you, Doris.

He gets up, moves away.

GEORGE
Now you want to hear the luck I
have? I'm happily married!

DORIS
(curiously)
Are you Jewish?

GEORGE
(thrown)
No.

DORIS
Then how come you feel so guilty?

GEORGE
Don't you feel guilty?

DORIS
Are you kidding? Half my high
school became nuns.

" GEORGE
Yeah, I guess Catholics have rules
about this sort of thing.

She takes makeup from purse, sits at dressing table and applies
it during following:

DORIS
They have rules about everything.
That's what's so great about being
Catholic. You know where you

It's very simple. My whole life

DORIS

GEORGE
I didn't hear you.

DORIS
I stuffed a towel in my mouth.

GEORGE
I'm sorry.

DORIS

That's okay. There's no use crying
over spilt milk.

GEORGE
You're right.

DORIS
Then how come we feel so terrible?

He looks at her for a moment.

GEORGE

(soberly)
Because we're two decent honest
people and this thing is tearing us
apart. I mean I know it wasn't our
fault but I keep seeing the faces
of my children and the look of be-
trayal in their eyes. I keep think-
ing of our marriage vows, the trust
my wife has placed in me, the ex-
periences we've shared together.
And you know the worst part of it ~
all? While I'm thinking all this,
I have this fantastic hard on.

There is a pause.

DORIS
No, It's not that. I have to go
to confession tomorrow.

He looks at her for a second, breaks into a rather forced, in-
credulous laugh, moves away, turns to her, chuckles.

GEORGE
We're both crazy, you know that?
I mean this sort of thing happens
to millions of people every day
..-You don't use actual names in
confession, do you?

DORIS
No.
He is relieved.
GEORGE
May I ask you something?
DORIS
Sure.
GEORGE

Would you go to bed with me again?

He moves quickly to her, starts to take her in his arms.

with intense calm.

GEORGE
Don't you understand? We're both
grown up people who have absolutely
nothing to beashamed or afraia of.

There is a knock at the door. Both freeze, their eyes reflect-
ing total panic.

GEORGE

Just a second!

They go into frantic action as they both dive for the clothes
on the floor, bumping into each other in the process. He
rolls sheet up, stuffs it under the bed as she grabs her hat,
jacket and purse and starts for the bathroom.

GEORGE

in a desperate
hiss)
Don't go into the bathroom!

DORIS
Why not?

GEORGE
It's the first place they look!

She heads for the French doors and exits onto the deck. On
his way to the front door he spots her girdle, grabs it,

EXT. COTTAGE DECK - DAY 28

Fairly large, furnished with two garden chairs, a small table,
a couple of chaise lounges and decorated with flower pots.
Although it has a marvelous view of the grounds and coastline,
it also has a secluded feeling due to the trellis overhang
and shrubbery.

As George peers down over the edge of the deck, the angle lets
us see Doris come through the front door of the cottage, move
through the room and out onto the deck behind George.

DORIS

voice)
You have a woman in here?

Startled, he turns to face her. When he has recovered he puts
tray down.

I have a friend who went into the

DORIS
From New Jersey?

He was my first client. It's kind

She reaches out her hand and takes the girdle from him. He
watches her as she puts it into her purse.

GEORGE
Doris, there's something I want to
tell you.

DORIS
What?

GEORGE

Well, you probably think I do this

Angle on a homemade sign reading "Happy Fifth Anniversary,
Darling."

As the angle widens we see that George, wearing a charcoal
suit and pink shirt of the period, is Pinning up the sign on
the inside of the front door. He has put on a few pounds,
his hair has just started to thin, and at thirty-two he gives
the impression of more substance. It is just an impression.
Although his manner is more subdued than five years ago and
his insecurities flash through less frequently, it is only
because he has learned a degree of his mercurial moods. He
moves to check some champagne that has been set up on the
piano, and then to the coffee table, where he proceeds to
light five candles set in a small iced cake.

Be sure and let me know when
you're coming out.

Okay -- now!

As Doris enters he sings and plays, "If I Knew You Were
Coming I'd Have Baked A Cake." She is dressed in a strap~
less black cocktail dress that was considered chic in the
suburbs in the fifties; is slimmer than before and more
carefully put together. The most striking physical change

in her is her very blonde hair, shaped in a Gina Lollobrigida
cut. She has acquired some of the social graces of middle
class suburbia, is more articulate than before, and has
developed a wry, deprecating wit that doesn't hide a certain
tenseness of manner. She does a little jitterbug step to the
music; he stops playing, embraces her.

GEORGE
Happy anniversary, darling.

He indicates the cake.

GEORGE
Cut the cake and make a wish.

He moves to pour two glasses of champagne as she sits on the
sofa, blows out the candles, cuts cake. He moves to sofa,
hands her champagne, sits beside her.

What did you wish?

I have only one wish.

(exploding)
Oh, will you stop! It's got
nothing to do with the goddamn
tooth fairy! You're consumed
with guilt and the only way you
can deal with it is by getting
as far away from me as possible!

GEORGE
Okay, I feel guilty! Is that so
strange? Doris, we're cheating.
Once a year we lie to our fanities
and sneak off to a hotel in
California and commit adultery!
(he holds up
his hands)
Not that I want to stop doing it!
But yes, I feel guilt. I admit
it.

You admit it? You take out ads!

DORIS (Cont'd)
You probably stop strangers in the
street. You've probably got a
scarlet 'A' embroidered on your
jockey shorts. You wander around
like an open nerve saying, ‘I'm
cheating but look how guilty I
feel so I must really be a nice
guy!' And to top it all, you have
the incredible arrogance to think
you're the only one in the world
with a conscience. Well, that
doesn't make you a nice guy. You
know what that makes you? A
horse's ass!

There is a pause.

GEORGE

You know something? I liked you
better before you joined the Book
of the Month Club.

That's not why you're leaving,
George.

Well, maybe we can talk about that

She looks at him in some surprise.

GEORGE
I really hate to ask you, Doris,
but I need a lift to the airport.

She just stares at him.

Small, unimposing, not much more than a wooden shack. Doris'
car pulls up in front of the terminal. George gets out and
runs through the rain towards the entrance. Halfway there,
he stops, turns and signals to her and disappears into the
terminal. Grim faced, Doris gets out of the car, gets
George's suitcase, follows him into terminal.

Doris looking out at the plane through the rain-splattered
window of the terminal.

INT. LOCAL TERMINAL - NIGHT 42

Small -- the bare necessities, the only decorations are some
mid-fifties advertising posters. A few passengers, mostly
holiday fishermen, are waiting. George, ticket in hand,
moves to Doris, looks at her, decides to try a cheerful
approach.

GEORGE
Cheer up, Doris -- it's not the end
of the world. I'm not leaving you
permanently.

DORIS

No, I don't think you will.

away a lifetime of weekends?

He remembers where he is as the passengers file by him on
the way to the plane and lowers his voice.

GEORGE
How can you be so casual?

DORIS
I don't see any point in going on.

He shakes head, moves to get suitcase.

GEORGE
Oh no. Don't do that to me, Doris.
Don't try to manipulate me. I get
enough of that at home.

the phone and started to call you
ten times. I couldn't seem to

slipping over into my '‘real' life
and it scared hell out of me. More

I decided to stop seeing you.

A day in February 1961. Doris, her hair back to her normal
color and her face looking a little softer, is driving a 1959
model American station wagon up the coast road.

INT. COTTAGE - INN - DAY 48

George, still wearing his raincoat and hat, is talking on the
phone. His unpacked suitcase is in the middle of the bed and
it is apparent that he has just arrived. As he talks he takes
off raincoat and hat, revealing that his hairline has receded
somewhat.

It's not something you have to ‘nip

Yes, of course I'm trying to do
something about it. Look, will

EXT. INN - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY 51

Doris' station wagon pulls in and comes to a stop. When she
gets out we see that she is obviously very, very pregnant.

Perspiring slightly, she gets her bag and starts off towards
the cottage.

pajamas, enters from bathroom, stops, smiles at her tenderly,
and speaks in a husky, sexy voice.

GEORGE

She turns to face him, revealing her eight months pregnant
stomach. His smile fades and his expression becomes frozen.

Doris, do you mind? We went to
London. We were checking into a
hotel and there was a man in a
formal coat and striped trousers
standing at the front entrance.
Helen handed him her suitcase and
breezed on into the lobby. The
man followed her and very politely
pointed out that not only didn't
he work at the hotel but that he
was the Danish ambassador.

at a large shade tree.

GEORGE

Without batting an eye, she said
‘Well, that's marvelous. Maybe
you can tell us the good places
to eat in Copenhagen.'

door opens and Doris bursts into the room. She is wearing
jeans, turtleneck sweater, Indian necklace, headband, long

bag.
DORIS
Hey, man -- what do ya say?

George, taken aback by her appearance, watches as she throws

No, we'll discuss it now! Why?

DORIS
Well, you're going to have to do

He stands up.

GEORGE
Okay, he was going to end the war!

He never said that. That's the

DORIS
It's a civil war. We have no right
being there in the first place.

weary cynicism.

A day in February, 1972. Doris and George are sitting up

manner reflects a slightly.self-conscious inner serenity.
Possibly he is wearing a mustache or a short beard.. Doris is
wearing an attractive kimono but during the scene will don
clothes and. makeup that will project an image of expensive,
good taste. After a moment or two she puts paper down, looks
at him. He smiles back at her.

DORIS
it's amazing how good it can be
after twenty-one years, isn't it?

GEORGE
Honey, if you add up all the times
we've actually made it together,
we're still on our honeymoon.

They exchange a contented look.

DORIS
Did I tell you I'm a grandmother?

GEORGE

No, but I think you picked a weird
time to announce it.

Anyway, you're the youngest look-~

She gets out of bed, moves to dressing table.

you.

She sits at dressing table, peers into mirror, starts to
brush hair and apply makeup.

We see there is a butterfly on the seat.

Why do you feel you need a valida-

We see Doris on the deck of the cottage, arranging some red (Xx)

splash of color against the muted tones of the misty day.

As the camera moves in closer on Doris, we see that she is

well dressed but her clothes are softer, more traditionally
feminine and less fashionable than the last time we saw her.

She takes the vase and moves back into cottage.

trying to hold it ina youthful posture. She gives up, exhales
breath, lets stomach out. She turns as the front door onens

Things that tight?

GEORGE
No, I'm okay. I've been doing
some teaching at U.C.L.A.

DORIS
Music?

GEORGE
Accounting.

He stands, she hands hima cup of coffee.

GEORGE
With everything that's been happening
out there it seems figures are still
the only things that don't lie.
(as she pours
herself coffee)
Doris, why'd you sell your business?

DORIS
(surprised)
How did you know that?

GEORGE
I'll tell you later. What made
you do it?

DORIS
I was bought out by a chain.
(a slight shrug)
it was the right offer at the
right time.

GEORGE
But what do you do with yourself?

DORIS
Oh, read, watch TV, Play a little
golf, visit my grandchildren. you
know, all the jet~set stuff.

GEORGE
I thought you loved working.

DORIS
Well, there was another factor.
Harry had a heart attack.

DORIS (Cont'd)
It turned out to be a mild one, but
he needed me to look after him --
(she shrugs)
So...anyway, it's not as if I'm
in permanent retirement. There's
a local election coming up in a
few months and I've been approached
to run.

GEORGE
On what ticket?

DORIS
Independent.

GEORGE
Figures.
(he sits)
Harry's okay now?

DORIS
Runs four miles a day and has a
body like Mark Spitz.
(drily)
Unfortunately, he still has a face
like Ernest Borgnine's.

George gets up, moves to look out of window.

GEORGE
How are you and Harry -- emotionally?
DORIS
Comfortable.
GEORGE
Comfortable?
DORIS

Oh, it's not such a bad state.
The word's been given a bad
reputation by the young.

She gets up, takes his raincoat, hangs it up.

DORIS
Where's your luggage? Still in
the car?

GEORGE
I didn't bring any. I -- I can't

stay, Doris.

GEORGE

Look, I have a lot to say and a

better start now.

She waits. He takes a breath.
GEORGE

First of all, Helen's known about
us for ten years.

DORIS
(finally)

When did you find out?

GEORGE
Two months ago.

DORIS
She never confronted you with it
before?

GEORGE
No.

She slowly sits.
DORIS

What made her tell you now?

GEORGE
She didn't. We have a very close
friend, Connie -- have I mentioned
her before?

Doris shakes her head.

GEORGE

Connie told me.

(he shakes his head

unbelievingly)
All those years and she never even
hinted she knew.

(a beat)
I guess that's the nicest story I've
ever told about her.

Your wife's an amazing woman.

GEORGE
She passed away, Doris. I lost
her six months ago. It -- it was
all very fast.

She looks at him uncomprehendingly for a moment before she
stands and moves away, her back to him.

GEORGE
I'm sorry to blurt it out like
that. I just couldn't think of
a -- a graceful way to tell you.

She nods, her back still to him

GEORGE
You okay, honey?

DORIS
It's so strange. I never met
Helen, but ~- but I feel as if

I've just lost my best friend.
It's -- crazy.

She moves to him, puts her hand on his cheek.

DORIS
Are the kids okay?

GEORGE
They'll survive. I don't think
I could have gotten through the
whole thing without them.

DORIS
I wish you'd tried to reach me.

GEORGE
I did. That's when I found out
you'd sold the stores. I called
and they gave me your home number.
I let the phone ring four times,
then I hung up. But it made me
feel better knowing you were there
if I needed you.

DORIS
I wish you'd spoken to me.

She looks at him, very moved.

DORIS
My God, that's terrible. We should
have been together.

He moves to sofa, pours them a second cup of coffee during
following.

GEORGE
I've been thinking about us a lot
lately. Everything we've been
through together. The things we've
shared. The times we've helped
each other. Did you know we've
made love a hundred and thirteen
times? I figured it out on my Bomar
calculator.

He pours cream.

GEORGE

It's a wonderful thing to know
someone that well. You know,
there is nothing about you I don't
know.

(holding up sugar

cubes)
It's two sugar, right?

DORIS
No, one.
GEORGE
Okay, so I don't know everything
about you.
(thinks)

I don't know who your favorite
movie stars are and I couldn't
remember the name of your favorite
perfume. I wracked my brain but

I couldn't remember.

She gives him a small smile.

DORIS
That's funny. It's "My Sin.”

with you. I find that incredible.
(he looks at her)
So what do you say, Doris, you want
to get married?

DORIS
(lightly)
Married? We shouldn't even be
doing this.

GEORGE
I'm serious.

She studies him for a moment.

DORIS
You really are, aren't you.

; GEORGE
What did you think I was -- just
another summer romance?

She doesn't say anything.

GEORGE
A simple 'yes' will do.

DORIS
(gently)
There's no such thing, my love.

He notices her expression.

GEORGE
What is it?

DORIS
I was just thinking of how many
times I've dreamed of you asking
mé this. It's pulled me through
a lot of bad times. I want to
thank you for that.

GEORGE
What did you say to me all those
times?

DORIS

I always said 'yes,'

Do you realize I'm giving you the
opportunity to marry a man who has
known you for twenty-six years and
can't walk by you without wanting
to grab your ass?

DORIS
(affectionately)
You always were a sweet talker.
GEORGE
Will you marry me? (X)

at him for a moment, moves away.

DORIS
(finally)
I can't.
GEORGE
Why not?
DORIS

I'm already married.

GEORGE
You feel you have to stay because
he needs you?

DORIS

No, it's a lot of things. Affection,
respect, a sense of continuity. We
share the same memories. It's --

(a slight

shrug)
~- comfortable. Maybe that's what
marriage is all about in the end --
I don't know.

There is a short pause.

(pacing up

I was the one who got you back
together six years ago! Why did
I do a stupid thing like that?
I mean why was I so damned
generous!

DORIS
Because you felt the same way about
Helen then as I do about Harry now.

GEORGE
What's that got to do with
anything?!

DORIS

If I hadn't gone back to Harry,
you might have been stuck with me
permanently and you were terrified.

He looks at her, manages a sheepish grin.
GEORGE

You could always see through me,
couldn't you?

DORIS
That's okay. I always liked what
I saw.

GEORGE

Well, I want you now.

DORIS
You can still have me once a year.
Same time, same place.

He looks at her for a moment.

GEORGE
(awkwardly, sincerely)
Doris, I need a wife. I'm just
not the kind of man who can live
alone. I want you to marry me,
but when I came here I knew there
was a chance you'd say 'no.'

He continues to talk quickly without a break.

What I'm trying to say is -- without
you, I'll probably end up with Connie.
She knows -- all about you. The

point is, she's not the sort of
woman who would accept the situation.
I suppose what I'm saying is that
we'll never see cach other again.

He moves to take her hand, sees that she is trembling.

GEORGE
Doris, for God's sake -- marry me!

DORIS
(finally; torn)
I -- I can't.

He moves away, turns to look at her.

GEORGE
I wish I could think of something
that would break your heart, make
you burst into tears, and come
away with me.

DORIS
(shaky)
You know us Italians. [Irish] We
never cry.

He makes a gesture of helplessness.

GEORGE
Yeah -- well, I have to catch a
plane. What time is it?

She looks at her wristwatch but due to the combination of
misty eyes and bad eyesight, she can't read it. She

holds out her arm. He moves to her, takes her wrist, looks
at watch.

GEORGE
(puzzled)
Five fifty-five,

DORIS
No, it's only two-thirty. I always
keep my watch three hours and
twenty-five minutes fast.

How long have you been doing that?

like that?
DORIS

Personal idiosyncrasy.
There is an awkward pause as they stare at one another.

GEORGE
Yeah ~- well ---

They embrace, clumsily and awkwardly, almost like two
strangers. They break and he moves halfway to the door,
turns.

GEORGE
Who were your favorite movie stars?

DORIS
Lon McAllister, Cary Grant, Marlon
Brando and Laurence Olivier.

GEORGE
You've come a long way.

DORIS
We both have.

He moves to door, opens it, turns.
GEORGE
Always keep your watch three hours
and twenty-five minutes fast, huh.
She nods. He makes a half-formed gesture of bewilderment.
GEORGE
I can't believe this is happening
to us.
He exits, shutting the door behind him. Doris stands for a
moment, trying to absorb the shock of his departure. Then,
trancelike, she gets her suitcase from the closet, puts it

on the sofa and starts to pack, but stops to look lovingly
around the room, drinking in the memories.

But -~ But what about Connie?

GEORGE
Connie's eighty-seven years old!!

She stares at him, speechless, as he throws his raincoat and
hat down through following:

GEORGE
Look, I wanted you to marry me and
I figured if you thought someone
else wanted me, I might stand a
better chance -- Okay, maybe I
didn't think it through. I was
desperate, okay?

She starts to laugh. He turns to look at her.

GEORGE
Look, for once in my life I wanted
a happy ending. Listen, I don't
want to talk about it any more!
I'm back and I'm going to keep coming
back every year until our bones are
too brittle to risk contact!
