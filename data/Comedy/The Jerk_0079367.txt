FADE IN:
EXT, THEATRE - NIGHT 1

Glamorous opening night crowds arriving at a hit
show; limousines discharging women in furs, men in
tuxedos, Flashbulbs pop for celebrity arrivals,
CHIMES announce curtain time, the lobby lights blink
invitingly. We MOVE IN cn this, a3 if arriving for
the show, only to PAN OFF TO an alley alongside th2
theatre, where a squalid derelict lies half-conscious
against the wall, hands clutching a ratty paper bag
wrapped’ around a bottle of Muscatel, meager belong-
ings crammed into a battered old suitcase tied with
clothesline and a necktie.

CLOSE ON THE BUM ~ 2

It's NAVIN, red-eyed and whiskered, the bottom of
the barrel. He looks directly INTO CAMERA.

NAVIN
My story...? I have not always
been like this. I once had wealth,
power, and the love of a beautiful
woman. Now, I only have two
things... My dignity... and my
pride...

A janitor hoses the alley down directly spraying
Navin.

NAVIN
(continuing;
recovering)

It was never easy for me...

EXT. SHARECROPPER'S CABIN IN MISSISSIPPI - DAY 3

It's a lazy Sunday afternoon, and a black family

(MOTHER, FATHER, grandma, and eight children ranging

from 24 to 7 years of age) are quietly absorbed in

routine tasks. Two black men, Uncle Sonny and Cousin *
Brownie play a rousing gospel type song and the family

joins in; some of the others keep time and play harmonic:.
Navin, dressed and placed as one of the family, is nodding
happily out of tempo. When the blues finishes, he is

the only one to applaud. As he looks around sheep-~
ishly: |

MOTHER

Not at all -- listen, everybody,

The family reacts with joy and enthusiasm.

NAVIN
Gee, Mom -- thanks.
MOTHER

Tunafish salad on white bread
with mayonnaise, a Tab, and a

Navin is hugging his Mom, trying to absorb

this information. Taj, the eldest, sticks his head in

the door.

TAI
I wrapped your sandwich in
cellophane, just how you like it.

~ You wanna come in and sing some

blues?

NAVIN
No thanks. There's something
about those songs, they -- they

Taj exits, and a moment later we HEAR the family launch
into a full Mississippi Delta rural BLUES. Mom leaves

Navin and

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 7

Navin is lying in the middle of a double bed with
his four black brothers. In the background we can
HEAR the RADIO PLAYING.

RADIO VOICE (V.0.)
... And that concludes this Sunday
night Gospel Hour, live from the
Four Square Gospel Church of
Divine Salvation in St. Louis,
Missouri, the Reverend Willard
* Willman, Pastor.

Navin stares into the night. The program changes.

ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
And now, Musit Throughout the Night;
music in a mellow mood.

One of the Fifties’ most forgettable standards in a
stupid Lawrence Welk Society Orchestra arrangement.
Navin looks up, caught by something. It's his theme,
his music.

The rhythm continues, Navin begins to snap his fingers
and tap his foot, this time definitely on the beat.

He climbs over his brothers, and glides into the liv~
ing room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 8

The music has shifted to another danceable 4/4 FOX-
TROT. Navin is box-stepping and dipping like crazy.
The light goes on from his parents' bedroom, and his
Mother, sleepy in curlers and nightdress, emerges.

Others in the family wake up to see what's going on.

FATHER (0.5.}
What in the hell is that noise?

MOTHER.
Navin ~- is that -you?

NAVIN

Elvira, Leroy, Mom, Dad, Satch,
Pierre... Listen! This is a music
I've never heard before! Listen

NAVIN *
Goodbye, Taj. Grandma.
Hugs and kisses all around. Profound, sincere fare-
wells. This is goodbye. Navin steps away, and walks
proudly out through the garden gate. Then he stands
in the road, puts out his thumb, and waits for a hitch.
The family stands around patiently, then, one by one,
drift off -- the kids to school, Pop to work, Mom
into the house. Navin waits, and waits.

daring trick. She then skids to a stop in front of
Navin and lewdly eyes him up and down.

PATTY

We HEAR a TRAIN WHISTLE. Steam escapes from between

The CAMERA PULLS BACK AND REVEALS Navin perched on
the cab of a miniature train ride. Navin is wearing
an engineer's costume with a hat.that says "Engineer
Fred. The train pulls up to the loading platform.
All the kids disembark and run to their parents.
Navin gets out, checks about the engine, oiling it,
etc. He notices a lovely girl, MARIE, standing near
the ticket booth. She is Tooking around frantically.

Suddenly, there is a gasp from the crowd.

ANCLE ON TRAIN 11l

It has started up without the engineer! Running the

The train is gaining momentum. The crowd yells,
"Save that child."

He gives her the oil can.

He hands over his wallet and keys. Navin runs after

to the cab and pulls the emergency brake as the child
shoves an ice cream cone in his face. The train
grinds to a halt as the crowd cheers. He picks up the
child, holds it up for Marie to see. He leaps off the
train and jumps through the roof of a miniature city
hall. Extricating himself, he destroys several more
houses. He walks over to Marie and hands her the
child. :

MARIE

Oh, thank you. It would have
been so embarrassing to go home
without Billy. Here's your keys

He jauntily throws it away. —

Listen, what you did just now was
very brave. Is there any way I

Stop! When you bought your home

Three years ago, a design popped
into my head. But I knew none of
my clients could live in Sid
Spector's dream. This design
needed someone special, someone
with vision. And when you walked
into my office, I said, 'These are

Mrs. Johnson, this house is I.
It is a complete living organism.
There are sheets on the bed, a
roast in the oven, and some
fabulously wonderful people in

this key, you are oromising Sid
Spector that you will live a
life of fun, more fun, and just

The knife is through his fly; he is nailed to the

NAVIN
Honey, you worry too much.

He pulls the knife out and crosses to a five-gallon

Sparkletts bottle bearing a Chateau Lafite Rothschild

label; from it Navin draws a wine glass full of rich,
red wine.

INT. PARTY ROOM - NIGHT . 236

CLOSEUP of Marie, radiant, her head tossed back. She
is in the midst of a torrid disco dance. SHOT WIDENS
TO INCLUDE the jumping party. Dancers, drinkers, etc.
Marie is dancing up a storm. With her is Navin danc-
ing in a stiff, lummox-like way.

NAVIN
(dressed in a
sharp tuxedo)
Those disco lessons really paid
off, honey.

ANOTHER ANGLE 237

The party is in full swing. On one wall is a giant
Advent T.V. screen showing an old western movie.
Navin and Marie at this point do a short, wild and
stunning disco-like dance to be choreographed. They
finish in a blaze of triumph. They are overapplauded
and overcomplimented. "Navin baby, you're too much,"
"Dollface, just super!" etc.

MARIE

Advent)
Oooh, honey, here's that interview
you did yesterday.

And this is the result...

your eyes are constantly drawn to it,

INT. PARTY ~- NIGHT 244

ANGLE ON the party crowd. They are sturined. A couple
of the partygoers remove their glasses to reveal crossed
eyes. Navin smiles sickly.

The partygoers drift off with excuses. "Boy, it's ten
after seven," "Another phony..." "Nouveau Riche..."
“He got what. he deserved," "He made my mother cock-
eyed." This last man is being restrained and dragged
off.

NAVIN
Honey, why the gloom; this is not
the end of the rainbow... I'm
Navin Johnson... inventor. I've
got art jigsaw puzzles... the
the the ear movies. This is a
parking ticket to me. Only
instead of five dollars, it's

The office is stripped bare with only one empty file

Navin exits the building and sits on a bench. There

Navin approaches the window and watches a pretty young
girl taking a pizza from an oven. As she is cutting it,
she feels Navin's eyes on her and looks up. -He looks so
Pathetic that her maternal instincts take hold. She wants
to do for this man what the girl in Midnight Express did
for her lover in the Turkish prison. She refers to her
lips; Naving shakes his head no. She thrusts her breasts
forward and shimmys them. Navin says no; he instead points
to the pizza. She understands, and with great compassion
squishes the pizza against the wall while Navin tries to
eat the pizza against the glass.

a stop at the light near Navin. He runs up to the car
removing a filthy rag from his coat pocket, and in an
