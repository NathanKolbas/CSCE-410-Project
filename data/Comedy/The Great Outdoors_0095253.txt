October 18, 1987 /
EXT. NORTH WOODS - LAKE - AFTERNOON i

A pristine lake deep in the North Woods. It's late
afternoon. Loons call. An eagle soars over the wate:

MAIN TITLES BEGIN. We hear Chet's VOICE OVER. His
speech has the quality and tone of documentary marra-
tion.

CHET (V.0O.)

Countless millions of Americans,
for years upon years...

EXT. LAKE ~ WATER'S EDGE 2
A deer drinks.
CHET (V.0.)
+.» have sought refuge from the

harsh detachment and sterile
serenity of modern life...

EXT. WOODS - TREE 3
A squirrel is sitting on a branch.
CHET (V.0.)
-... in the honest embrace of the
forest.
EXT. MARSH 4
A goose and her goslings paddle through the reeds.
CHET (V.0.)
They return again and again to
refresh their weary souls, restore
their battered faith.
EXT. FOREST - TREES 5
A stand of virgin pine.
CHET (¥V.0.)

Renew... the ties that bind. To
marvel at the wonders of nature...
EXT, FOREST ~ TREE
A woodpecker beats against a pine.

CHET (V.0O.)
-.. and enjoy the boundless
rewards...

EXT. PERK'S PINE LOG RESORT - WIDE - ESTABLISH ~ DAY

A quiet, little resort made up of a dozen quaint log
lodges, a modest beach and boat dock, a raft, some
fishing beats, an office, bar and game room and lots of
stately pines between two of which is the Ripley
family's station wagon.

INT. CAR

We meet the Ripley's. Behind the wheel is the father,
CHET. He's in his late-thirties. He wears his hair in
a straight business cut. Beside him is his wife,
CONNIE. She's in her late~thirties. Attractive,
strong and independent. In the back seat are their
children. BEN, 8, and BUCK, 13. Ben is precocious,
impish and somewhat detached from the normal interest
of a boy his age. Suck is handsome, quiet and
controlled. Chet is finishing his grand speech.

CHE? (V.0.)
... of the pure and simple style
of life that prevails in the Big
Country.
Chet takes a moment to enjoy his speech. The rest of
the family sits unimpressed and unmoved.
CLOSEUP - BUCK
Chet's speech rings a bell. He thinks for a moment,
then looks at Ben.
BEN AND BUCK
They exchange looks. The speech is familiar to Ben as
well.
INT. CAR - FRONT SEAT

Buck leans forward in the seat, between Connie and
Chet.

BUCK
Dad? You read that off the
brochure that came with the
fishing poles.

Chet clears his throat to cover his embarrassment at
getting caught quoting a brochure.

CHET
So what if I did? It doesn't
matter where it came from, it's
true and we're going to experience
every bit of it.

CONNIE
If we're going to experience every
bit of it, shouldn't we get out of
the car?

CHET
Absolutely. Let's go!

All four family members swing their doors open.

EXT, STATION WAGON - FRONT ANGLE/OVERHEAD ANGLE 9

All four station wagon deers open simultaneously ——
WEAM! ~~ into pine trees.

CLOSEUP ~- CHET
He looks at Connie with a big grin.

CHET
Whoa! Trees in the parking lot!
What a place! Nature everywhere
you park!

INT. RESORT OFFICE - DAY 190

It's a small, knotty pine room with a desk, stuffed
chairs, rag rugs and a fireplace over which hangs a
moosenead. The fur on.the moose's nose is long gone
from thirty years of petting by guests and their chil-
dren. A small restaurant if off to one side, a bar
with a couple of old lushes nailed to the bar. Chet
opens the door and peeks in. He walks in. He's over-
come by a wave of nostalgia.

CHET
Oh, for God’s sake. Just like IT

He looks at the moosehead.

CLOSEUP - MOOSE

The nose is badly worn from pecple rubbing it and the
eyes are crossed.

EXT. OFFICE - DAY lL

Connie and the boys are outside the office, looking
around.

BEN
This is going to be a living hell.
CONNIE
Watch your mouth.
BUCK
What happened to us going to
California?
CONNIE
Dad decided on Lake Potowota...
BEN
».. minimac.
BUCK

I know, but why?

CONNIE
He has his reasons and I don't
think it's your place to question
his decisions.

BEN
This is an extension of the
working father guilt syndrome
thing. Right?

CONNIE
I don't think there's anything
wrong with us spending a week
together at a nice lake tesort.

BUCK
Did you want to come here?

. CONNIE
O£ course not. I wanted to go to
California like any other normal
person would.
INT. OFFICE - DAY 12
Chet is standing before the mounted moosehead. He
raises his right hand and lifts his little finger,
closes his eyes and with the other hand rubs the
moose's nose. He recites a brief North Woods incanta-
tion.
CHET
Ahnaweeo, anasaugatuck, Bring this
little boy a bundle of luck.
INT. BAR ~ DAY
Adjacent to the office. A couple of REGULARS look over
their shoulders as they hear Chet CHANTING.
THEIR P.O.V.
Chet's in the Lobby with his raised hand, chanting
Indian jibberish, rubbing the moose's nose.

TWO-SHOT - REGULARS

They trade curious looks.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Chet fishes into his pocket for a penny. He holds the
penny in one hand, his hand is on the moose's nose.

CHET
Winna-laka-missee, bunkachu-go, To
praise the great Indian Chief a
new penny I throw.

He tosses the penny over his shoulder.

INT, BAR - DAY

The penny lands in the bowl of complimentary cheddar
cheese fish.

INT. LOBBY - DAY
Chet turns to see where the penny landed. He sees the

regulars looking at him. He feels slightly
embarrassed.

 

CHET
I used to do this with my dad when
I was a kid. Didn't you used to
do this... with... your dad?
No? I£ you'll excuse me, I have
to check in. Thanks. And sorry.
Keep the change.

He offers a limp smile and strolls to the desk.

CHET
(continuing)
Hello?

There's no response. Chet peeks back into the bar.

CHET
(continuing)
I love the woods.

He smiles again. Connie and the boys enter the office.

CHET
(continuing)
Well? Is this a real North Woods
lodge? Suh? Boys? Isn't this
rugged? Check out the shotgun
lamp over there.

Chet points out, Buck and Ben look.

THEIR P.O.V.

A shotgun that's been made into a lamp. [t's standing
on end with a light bulb screwed into the barrel and a
small shade on the bulb.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Chet's very proud. Buck and Ben are not terribly im-
pressed. Chet leans over the lobby counter.

CHET
Hello?

INT. OFFICE - BACKROOM ~ DAY 13

A middle-aged man and a middle-aged woman are asleep in
the stuffed chairs in a small office behind the front
desk. WALLY and JUANITA MOBERT. They're snoring
gencly. He's in bermuda shorts, an “I'VE BEEN TO
DULUTH" t-shirt, black knee socks, leather sandals and
a Milwaukee Brewer's cap, Juanita is wearing a sun-
dress, peds, cheap jogging shoes and a Budweiser visor.

Hello? CHET (0.S.)
ello?

INT. OFFICE ~ DAY 14

Chet leans over the desk peeking into the backroom. He
can't see Wally and Juanita.

CHET
Anybody home?

He turns back to Connie.

CHET
(continuing)
Can you imagine an unattended
motel office in Chicago? No way.
This is good, old-fashioned North
Woods trust.

Be looks down on the desk.

CLOSEUP ~ DESK

A little plastic pawderhorn lays on a nand-printed sign
that reads: "FOR PROMPT SERVICE, BLOW ME." The first
three words are on one line. "BLOW ME" is below and in
italics.

CEET

He picks up the horn and looks at it distastefully. He
wipes it on his sleeve and shrugs.

CHET
Neat little touch, hun?

CONNIE
(unimpressed)
Charming.
Chet puts the horn to his lips and blows it softly.

No sound. He looks at the end of the little horn to
see if it's clogged. He fills his lungs and blows with
all his might. Still no sound. He puts it to his lips
again and blows a third time. Suddenly, a huge, © Ye
mixed-breed German Shepherd with a snout covered with
porcupine quills and burrs leaps up from behind the
desk and barks an inch from Chet'’s face.

 

 

INT. BACKROOM - WALLY AND JUANITA - DAY 1s
They're blasted from their slumber.

WALLY
Ho!

SUANITA
Hup!

They look around. Get their bearings, realize
someone's at the desk. In unison, they rock back and
forward, back and forward and up and out of the chairs.

INT. OFFICE ~ THE FAMILY ~ DAY 16
They waddle out of the backroom.

WALLY
Howdy, folks. Don't mind Wormer.
She don't care for people.
(yells to the
dog)
Shut the frig up!

Wormer stops in mid-bark. Wally pulls the dog down and
it retreats back to its position under the counter.

WALLY
(continuing)
Now, what can I do you folks for?
HIS P.O.¥.
The Ripley's are paralyzed with fear. Frozen expres ~
sions of horror.
EXT. HIGHWAY ~ DAY 17

A Mercedes station wagon speeds along the highway.

EXT. CABIN - DAY - LATER 18

The family admires a beautiful log cabin. Chet pulls
up behind them and gets out of the wagon. Connie's
impressed. Even Buck and Ben are pleased. Wally and
Juanita flank the family. They love the cabin.

WALLY
You city dwelling fools are damn
lucky to have this place. It just
come available this morning.

CHET
(proud)
This is a dream come true.
JUANITA
Yep. We call it the Loon's Nest.
WALLY
{to Ben)

You ever seen a loon, noodlehead?

BEN
We have one in our family.

CLOSEUP - CHET

Smiling.

EXT. CABIN - DAY
Connie steps in front of Ben to quiet him.

JUANITA
We had a fishing party in there up
till yesterday. They caught their
limit and blew. It's all
redecorated inside. Wally and me
sunk over 300 bucks into it, not
counting what we spent in lysol.
Beautiful. Nothing within a
hundred miles compares. Not even
the Holiday inn.

Chet puts his arm around Connie and gives her a little
hug.

WALLY
I think Juanita here owes me a
liverwurst sandwich and a glass of
buttermilk.

well water.

EXT. SECONDARY HIGHWAY - DAY 19

The Mercedes we saw earlier flies down the two-lane,
blows its horn and whips around a slow-moving car.

INT. CABIN - DAY 20

The front door opens and Chet sweeps his arm. A grand
introduction to the interior. Connie and the boys
stare. Chet looks. His big smile fades.

CHET'S P.O.V.

The cabin is dirty and cluttered. The remains of a
pizza and beer blast from the previous party is quietly
molding on the tables. Newspapers, magazines, fishing
gear, buckets, cans, trash bags, dust, cobwebs and
rubbish. The building itself is beautiful in its own
right but is ebviously uncared for. [It needs a good
cleaning. The furnishings are straight, standard cot~
tage sofas and chairs. Except for a large oil portrait
of JFK, Elvis Presley and Vince Lombardi wearing halos.

 

CLOSEUP - CHET
Looks for the bright side.
CHET
Just think how much we're going to
have to appreciate when we get
back home!

A lame laugh.

The Mercedes station wagon flies through the trees and
grinds to a stop outside the lodge.

sunglasses. The dark glasses are slowly and dramati-
cally removed and we meet ROMAN CRAIG.

ROMAN
What a gas! Chet's gonna shit
plutonium pellets! What a solid
surprise!

INT. CAR 22

We meet his family. His attractive and chic wife,
KATE, his twin nine-year-old daughters, CARA and MARA.
Kate's in an expensive blouse and skirt. Cara and Mara
are in sundresses embroidered with their names.
Strange, withdrawn children.

ROMAN
I'll go £ind out where Chet's
bivouacked the family.

KATE
This is very unfair, Roman.

ROMAN
What the hell are you talking
about? We're family for crying
out loud. Listen, how many times
have we invited Chet and Connie to
the Islands with us? A billion?

KATE
This is a little different. We
weren't invited.

ROMAN
They'll be tickled to death to see
us. What the hell is there to do
up here? Fish?

KATE
I just hate to impose.

Connie's cleaning the stovetop. The kitchen has been

cleaned. Chet walks in, freshly showered.
behind Connie and kisses her neck.

CHET
What're you doing? Get your
bathing suit on and let's go to
the lake.
CONNIE
You go ahead. I can't relax in
filth.
Chet turns her around ané wraps her in his

We'll all pitch in and clean the
place tonight.

Be gives her a kiss.

He's unzipping Connie's skirt.

CHET AND CONNIE

He walks up

His persuasion isn't working. Chet is undaunted.

Connie's top slips down to her waist. Chet goes for
her bra.

CONNIE
Stop iti

CHET
What? I'm helping you get into
your bathing suit.

CONNIE
I'Ll go to the bedroom, thank you.

EXT. BEACH - DAY 25
Buck and Ben are standing at the water's edge.

BEN
I think Dad's over-reacting to the
involved father deal. I don't
knew anybody who sees their dad
all that much.

BUCK
You know, if he'd get wise to the
fact that we love him just the way
he is, it'd save us all a lot of
trouble.

BEN
Do you really care if he's a vast
reservoir of North Woods lore?

BUCK
No.

BEN
You don't think he's going to make
us sit on the porch and whittle,
do you?
Wally comes toddling down the bluff to the beach.

Buck and Ben look at him like he's crazy. Wally cups
his hand to his brow and looks out across the water.

WALLY

He's out there alright.

BUCK
Who's Monster Mouth?

WALLY
Fish, son. Muskellunge. Related
to your pikes and pickerels, only
bigger and meaner than both you
boys put together.

The boys are skeptical.

WALLY

(continuing)
He's been out there for years.
Nobody's caught him yet. Too
smart. Plenty of you city dweller
types go out there aiming to haul
him in. And plenty of you die in
his jaws. Brutal, old,
bloodthirsty peckerhead, he is.

{sneaks a look

to see if he's

scaring the boys)
So, if you fellas go out there in
God's pool, you make sure you take
a parent or guardian along. And
if they've got a weapon, remind
them to bring it. I don't need to
be cleaning guts up off the beach.
I got plenty of other things to
do.

Ben and Buck look out across the water.

WALLY
(continuing)
By the way, don't you boneheads do
no diving off the dock. I don’t
need no lawsuits.

Be winks and heads up the bluff. Buck and Ben look out
across the lake.

That was bullshit.

BEN
Absolutely.

They look out at the lake for a moment. They feel.
strange sensations. They look at each other.

BEN
(continuing)
Do you sense the presence of an
alien life form?

BUCK
Now that you mention, I do.

They slowly turn and look down the dock.

THEIR P.O.V.

The twins stand shoulder-to-shoulder at the end of the
dock.

CLOSEUP - TWINS

Blank, spooky, Frozen expressions.

26 EXT. SUN PORCH - DAY - LATER 26

Chet and Roman are sitting on the porch, sipping cock-
tails from juice glasses.

CHET
I still can't picture you enjoying
a vacation in the woods.

ROMAN
Me either. But Katie wanted to be
with Connie. You know, you guys
pimp us every time we invite you
to the Islands. I can't resist
Katie when she begs for something.

Roman stirs his drink with his baby finger. His pinkie
ring clinks against the glass. He looks at Chet with a
smile.

ROMAN

You really dig this shit, don't
you? ”

Chet gives Roman a weary look.

ROMAN
(continuing)
The woods. Hunting, fishing,
camping, boating, mosquitoes,
gnats, raccoons, stuffed fish,
pine trees, cabins that smell like
piss... .

Chet nods. He ignores the insulting tone.

ROMAN

(continuing)

Sand in your bed, cleaning perch,
listening to bugs rubbing their
legs together.

(looks at his glass)
Drinking Tanqueray out of a Jabba
the Hut glass. Horseshoes, paper
plates, calamine lotion, ticks,
_chiggers, mildew, poison oak, ivy
and summack, lake weeds that wrap
around your ankles when you

swim...
CHET
(interrupts)
What happened to the European
trip?
ROMAN

Katie wanted to do this. She was
worried about the terrorism thing.
Personally, I think it's a lot
hippier to get blown-up in the
Rome airport than it is to die of
boredom in the woods. But rule
number one, I run my home
democratically, and Kate and the
girls wanted to come up here to
spend time with Connie and the
boys, so here we are. I have to
eat about six grand in deposits
but what the hell, we're all here
together and that's what matters.

CHET

Six grand's a lot of money to
throw away. Maybe you should
reconsider.

ROMAN

As far as I'm concerned, it does,
but we'll get into that later.

The point is, money grows on
trees, good family relationships
don't. Six grand is a small price
to pay to see our two families
together, right?

CHET
{reluctantly)
Right.

ROMAN
You bet. So, anyway, you're an
intelligent man, you make a good
living, you got some options, why
the heck would you want to come up
to this plant~infested no~-man's
land and live like a barbarian for
a week?

Chet looks at Roman. He's stunned that Roman can so
easily trash nis vacation in one sentence. Roman is
unaware that he's insulting Chet. He sincerely be-
lieves he's just speaking truth.

surrounding forest. An unexpected moment of appreci-

ROMAN
You know what I see when I look
out there?

THEIR P.O.V.

The most beautiful forest imaginable.

CLOSEUP - ROMAN
He sweeps his hand across the landscape.

ROMAN
I see the underdeveloped resources
of Northern Minnesota, Wisconsin
and Michigan. I see a syndicated
development consortium exploiting
a gocd billion and a half doliars
in forest products. Lumber, pulp,
animal skins, exotic game meats,
rare mushrooms, medicinal fungi,
firewood. I see clearing out the
prime timber, the pelts, the ducks
and whatever other miscellaneous
salables are out there. A paper
mill and if the metals are there,
a mining operation. A green belt
between condos on the lake and a
waste management facility,
focusing on the newest rage in
toxic waste, medical refuse.
Infected bandages, bedy parts, IV
tubing, contaminated glassware,
entrails, syringes, blood fluids,
low-grade radioactive waste. All
safely contained for centuries.
What do you see?

Just trees, Roman. Just trees.

That's a compliment because the
rest of us are probably going to

CHET
Yeah, probably. That's what I'm

ROMAN
Look what I pull down a year

I doubt it. You're drawing a
check from a company that's
cleaning up on your sweat. You're
a new age slave, Chet.

CHET
I'm in the auto parts business.
I've been in it for fifteen years.
They've done well by me and I've
done weil by them.

ROMAN
You don't think the chairman of
your company would sell the
goddamn works if he had the
@ chance? Auto parts is a hot
business.

CHET
They're always going to need a
regional manager no matter who
owns the company.

ROMAN
. I can't believe how dangerously

old fashioned your thinking is.
Companies are valuable if they can
be bought and sold. If they
aren't well-run, guys like me and
my partner who think they can do
it better, put together a
financing package, pick up the
company, liquidate the assets,
slim the operation down and sell
it to the next guy. Don't you
see? I£ your company is a house
on the market, you're the water
heater. I'm an independently
wealthy man who uses his brains

; and drive to benefit himself.

damp, dark basement being bought

Matter.

Roman's argument, while flawed, is passionate and impressive.
Chet has little to come back with.

CHET
Three hundred percent profit?

ROMAN
Not every time. Sometimes it's as
little as 2002 and sometimes more.
But you take the good with the bad.
And you should have your piece, too.

Connie and Kate come out of the house with cocktails. They're
laughing and having a fine time.

CONNIE
How're those tails?

She looks over the grill. Roman gives her a peck on the cheek.
ROMAN

These are killers. Twenty-eight
bucks a pound.

Oh, my God. Chet? Twenty-eight

lobster in an age. Not since our

anniversary, anyway.

CHET
You never ask for it.

ROMAN
And the gourmet here wanted to eat
hotdogs. You know they make those
things out of lips and assholes.

CHET

Mmmn! If I could market the taste of these
lips, I'd make another million.

ROMAN .
I know that a terrifying story like
that coming from the mouth of a4 recognized
authority figure is traumatizing
because I had a similar experience
with my Uncle Roy and a story ke told
abouc a family that went to the woods
and was attacked by a band of escaped
Army psychiatric patients who'd been
subjected to vicious, violent, hellish
behavior modification experiments. They
escaped the metal boxes that they lived
in and went off into the woods and slaughtered
and ate this family before they were
recaptured. Now, that story gave me
nightmares not to be believed and I
don't want Uncle Chec's bear story to
upset you in the same way. So I'm here
to say there isn't a bear like that, none
of what Uncle Chet said actually happened
and that even if there were a bear out
there, I'm in the house prepared to
protect you. I love you and nothing
will happen to you. At the absolute worst,
and I'm not saying this'll happen but
in a worst case sceanerio, maybe a bear gets
in the house but believe me, he'll go
for the cookies and sweets before he
goes for you and anyone else
So, wa're ast 2 to th

have to feed it flies or bugs or
worms or whatever it eats. And
you have to give it water and
clean the jar from time to time.

BUCK
My question was more about what do
you do when you have to leave.

CHET
You have to let it out of the
jar. You can't take it home, if
that's the next question. It
wouldn't be fair. Everything has
its place and your creature's
place is here.

Oh. Well, it still applies. Not
the bugs and worms but how you
have to deal with a person you
meet on a trip. She can't come
home with you and you can't stay
here. It's easy to get your heart
broken and to break hers if you're
realistic about the situation and
honest with each other.

BUCK
Maybe.

You think about it and come to
your own conclusions. You have my
two cents but the decision's
yours.
