FADE IN
EXT. NOONAN HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

It's seven o'clock and the birds are singing in the trees
outside an old, two-story frame house with a sagging front
porch and peeling white paint, anly half-covered by a partial
paint job.

MRS, NOONAN (v.0.)
(shouting cheerily)

Let's go kids! Rise and shine! Let's

hit the deck! Let's go-go-go!

A dog begins BARKING.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Doors fly open and a half dozen children start pouring into
the hall, racing for the bathroom, and rough~-housing down
the stairs.

MRS. NOONAN

She stands at the foot of the stairs calling up to the gang
of kids. She's a plump, cheerful woman with a helpful,
supportive manner. The family COLLIE runs up the stairs
still BARKING.

MRS. NOONAN
{calling out)
Up, up, up! Andy? Billy? I'm
not hearing any movement up there!
Make sure Danny's up, please, Uppie-
uppie everybody!

INT, DANNY NOONAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

The first light of day filters through the window revealing

an incredibly messy boy's bedroom littered with dirty laundry,
books, comics, breken toys and an electric guitar. The walls
are covered with KISS posters, framed athletic awards and
cheesy trophies on a homemade bookshelf, Little League team
pictures and a poster-sized blow-up of John Belushi. A broken
model spaceship dangles from a thread from the ceiling fixture.

 

Three brothers share the room. ANDY and BILLY, twelve and
thirteen are getting dressed. DANNY NOONAN, age eighteen,
sits on the cdge of his bed rubbing his eyes. He's a manly,
good-looking, athletic kid with a kind of quick, natural
intelligence -- the oldest and biggest of the Noonan kids.

DANNY
(shouts)
I'm up.

He hops out of bed and heads for the bathroom.

HALLWAY

BILLY, ED and KATHLEEN are already lined up at the bathroom
door, waiting impatiently in their pajamas.

DANNY
(impatiently)
Who's in there?

KATHLEEN
Danny, will you tell Nancy to get
out of there?

BILLY
She's been in there an hour!

Danny goes right to the bathroom door, knocks once and barges in,

catching twelve year old NANCY in her panties, her mother's
rouge and lipstick smeared on her mouth.

DANNY
Come on, Nance!

NANCY
{screams)
Danny!
She grabs her robe and runs out.
NANCY
(off camera)
Mother! Danny saw me naked!

DANNY
There's not much to see.

Danny puts some Crest on his toothbrush and leaves the
bathroom.
THE HALLWAY

As Danny comes out; Billy, Ed and Kathleen fight to get in
next.

ED
I'm next! I called it!

KATHLEEN
(pushing him)
Oh no you don't!

BILLY
Shotgun!

Danny heads back to his bedroom and almost trips over a three
year old sitting on a potty.

THREE YEAR OLD
I'm pooping, Danny.

DANNY
(laughs)
I'm proud.

INT. DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

MR. NOONAN, Danny's father, is trying to eat breakfast and

read the newspaper while the kids pop in and out of the

room. He loves his children, but over the years, with each

new addition to the family, he's come to feel more and more
- like a forgotten guest in his own home.

Danny comes through the dining room on his way to the kitchen.

DANNY
Hi, Dad. Can I ---

MR. NOONAN
No.

DANNY
(protesting)
You didn't even hear ---

MR. NOONAN
Whatever it is -- no!

Danny goes through the open door into the kitchen unfazed by
his father's churlishness.

INT. KITCHEN

MRS. NOONAN is busy making fried egg sandwiches. A crying
four year old clings to her apron while other kids pillage
the refrigerator, spill milk and orange juice, and slop
cereal into bowls. The dog is barking, the phone is ringing
and the radio plays loudly. Danny gets a bowl and spoon from
the cupboard.

MRS. NOONAN
-- aS soon as you guys get back
from Little League, maybe we can
get some painting done on the house.

Thirteen year old SAM runs in and grabs a sandwich.

SAM
The Douglases got fake brick. You
don't have to paint it.

MRS. NOONAN
Hooray for the Douglases.

A baby in a high chair throws a cup.

MRS. NOONAN
Dory! Bad girl!
(to the crying
four year old)
Sally, honey, you don't have to be
up yet. Go back to bed.

Danny grabs the Cheerios and is almost out the door.
~ . MRS. NOONAN
Danny? No word from St. Copius yet?

DANNY
(evasive)
No, but I'm not so sure about that
place anymore. I talked to a guy
who went to college there. It's
right in the middle of a cornfield.
They get eight feet of snow ---

MRS. NOONAN
It's a fine college and you know it.

DANNY
I don't know anything,

He escapes to the dining room, and without sitting down, grabs
the pitcher of milk off the table and pours some on his ‘Cheerios.

MR. NOONAN
You get out yesterday?

DANNY
_ (spooning lots of
sugar on his cereal}
Twice. I caddied for Mr. Webb in
the morning and then doubles in the
afternoon.

MR. NOONAN
How much is that?

DANNY
Twelve-sixty plus about three bucks
in tips.

MR. NOONAN

Well? Put it in the college fund.

Danny sighs, puts down his bowl and goes to a kitchen cupboard,
digging into his pocket. Mr. Noonan watches him through the
open door. Mrs. Noonan is wiping up spills and feeding the
dog at the same time.

MRS. NOONAN
Maybe you should call the St. Copius
scholarship people. They should've
let you know by now. Sally, honey,
don't put eggs in your hair.

DANNY
(pulling bills
out of his pocket)
I heard there's only two girls there
and they're both nuns. This guy had
to take a cow to the prom and the
cow had to be in carly.

MRS. NOONAN
Well, the Mazenak boy went to
St. Copious and he had a marvelous
time.

DANNY
{taking a cookie
jar off the shelf}
Me's the one who went out with the
cow.

He stuffs the money into the cookie jar trying to hide it
from his father.

MR. NOONAN
(from the dining room)
I saw that! That was about five
bucks and change.

Danny comes back into the dining room eating his cereal.
DANNY
I had a couple of burgers and some

Pepsis for lunch.

He flees toward the kitchen.

MR. NOONAN
How many Pepsis?

DANNY
(from the kitchen}
Four or five.

MR. NOONAN
What are you -- a diabetic!?

KIDS
Hit him, Dad! Get the strap!
Danny's a diatetic!

Danny dumps his dirty dishes in the sink.

MR. NOONAN
(shouts from
the dining room)
You're not leaving this house till
we settle this college thing.

DANNY
I'm just going upstairs for a
minute.

He dashes out of the kitchen and up the stairs.
MR. NOONAN
(o.s. to Mrs. Noonan)
I'm telling you, if he hasn't got
anything lined up by September,
I'm going to ask Tom Burdick to
put him on at the lumberyard.
INT. DANNY'S ROOM
He can hear his parents arguing as he rummages in his closet.
MRS. NOONAN (0.s.)}
He's not going to work in the lumber-
yard!
Danny grabs a faded windbreaker and a letter drops out of the

pocket. He reads it with a grim expression.

THE LETTER

It reads: The St. Copius scholarship foundation regrets to
inform you that your application for student aid has been
refused, etc.

MR. NOONAN (0.s.)
Well, he's not going to be a caddy
all his life, is he?
DANNY
He folds up the letter and hides it on a shelf.
MRS. NOONAN (v.0.)
Danny? Devilled ham or tuna? JI can't
open both.
DANNY
{shouts}
How about neither?
With the argument continuing downstairs, he goes to the
window and jumps out. For a moment we think he's committed
suicide.
EXT. DANNY'S WINDOW
He swings nimbly to a downspout, hops to a tree branch,
climbs through a weathered treehouse and slides down a
rope to the ground. Then he jumps on a Sears ten speed
bike and pedals away.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET

Danny rides down a street lined with houses like his own.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET

The houses are bigger, the lawns wider and greener, as
Danny crosses over into a more exclusive section of the
suburbs.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET

Now Danny is riding past large mansions on rambling estates.

EXT. BUSHWOOD COUNTRY CLUB

Danny turns down a private driveway flanked by two stone
columns. On one column is a brass plaque that reads:
Bushwood Country Club. END CREDITS.

EXT. THE GOLF COURSE - A LITTLE LATER

Early morning mist rises from the golf course and shafts of
sunlight slant through the trees as we look at two figures
standing on the tee five hundred yards away. One of the
figures swings, a click is heard and ball sails into the
air. It hangs for a long moment and drops right in the
middle of the fairway, two hundred yards from the green.

The golfer hands his club to his caddy and starts walking
toward the ball.

As they approach, we begin to see them more clearly. It is
Danny, caddying for TY WEBB, a handsome, thirty-ish bachelor
with clear eyes and an air of relaxed self control. His
outfit is all soft flannel and cashmere. Everything about
him tells us that he is the perfect golfer.

TY AND DANNY

They walk along in quiet conversation. Danny tries hard to
match Ty's easy, elegant stride.

DANNY

Mr. Webb, can I ask you something?
TY

Sure.
DANNY

When you were eighteen, do you
remember having trouble deciding
what you wanted to do with your...
uh, you know...life?

TY
Sure. I didn't know whether to go
to West Point, sail my father's
ship to the islands or just take
a year off skiing in the Alps. why?

DANNY
Forget it. I don't think you'd
understand.

Ty

Come on. I know what you mean. I
had the same problem at eighteen, at
twenty-one, twenty-five, twenty-nine
and thirty-two ~~ and yesterday. I
almost blew my brains out with a
silver-plated Beretta. So what's
your problem?

CONTINUED

[LINOUNTMLLIGE CGM
CONTINUED

DANNY
What isn't my problem? Did you
have to take the Cooter Preference
test when you were a senior in
high school?

 

TY
Yes. It said I should be a
firewatcher. What are you
supposed to be?

DANNY
An underachiever.
{shakes his head)
I gotta go to college. I gotta!

TY
Do you want to go to college?

DANNY
In Nebraska? Besides, it costs
like eight thousand dollars a
year. My Dad can't afford it.
And I haven't even told him about
the scholarship I didn't get.
I'll probably have to work in
a lumberyard for the rest of
my life.

TY
What's wrong with lumber. I own
two lumberyards.

DANNY
I notice you don't spend too much
time there.

TY
I don't know where they are.

They reach Ty's ball.

THE LAKE

Ty's ball

rests near the edge of a beautiful lake that cuts

across the fairway. On the opposite shore is a lovely
green flanked by sandtraps.

TY
Okay, Danny. TI think you've
suffered enough. First lesson.
Did you sce Star Wars?
(he takes a silk
scarf out of
his golf bag)

DANNY
Yeah --~

TY
All right. I'll be Alec Guiness
and you be the wimpy kid from the
Space farm.

DANNY
Thanks.

TY
(blindfolding
himself)
There's a force in the universe
that makes things happen. Al1
you have to do is get in touch
with it.

He fumbles with the clubs in his bag, feeling for a seven
iron. Finally he lifts the blindfold a little and takes
the right club. Then he goes to his ball and takes a
blindfolded practice swing.

. TY
Find your center -~- stop thinking
-- let it happen -- ‘Be the ball' --

(he swings and
hits the ball)

THE BALL

It sails over the lake, hits high on the green and rolls back
down to within inches of the hole.

DANNY AND TY
Danny stands there amazed. Ty starts blindfolding him.
DANNY
(surprised)

What?

TY
Hit one. Try it.

Danny peeks to line up the shot, then lowers the blindfold
and gets ready to hit.

DANNY
(impatiently)
It's a little hard with you talking
like that.
TY
Oh! All right -- I'1l shut up --
I'm shutting up now -- I've stepped
talking.

Danny swings and hits the ball. Ty watches it rise and
drop into the lake.

DANNY
{taking off
the blindfold}
Where'd it go?

TY
Right in the lumberyard. We'll
work on it -- honestly. Just

figure out what you really want.
Once you know, everything else
takes care of itself.

They walk off together. A mechanical roar is heard.

A KUGE TRACTOR MOWER

A huge grasscutter appears suddenly over a rise, it's big
plaid blower bags ballooning out from its sides. The
GROUNDSKEEPER waves casually to Ty and Danny from his
tractor seat as he rumbles past them.

cuT TO

EXT. THE STREET

A public transit bus stops across the street from the: main
entrance to the club. The route sign on the front of ‘the
bus reads: FROM THE ClTY. The bus pulls away revealing a
half dozen teenage CADDIES arriving for work. They cross
the street, rollicking and punching at each other. A few
Black and Latin Maids and Kitchen Helpers arrive with them.

EXT. THE PARKING LOT

The caddies come up the driveway. Leading the group is
TONY D'ANNUNZIO, nineteen, a tough-looking, inner-city

kid with disco haircut and a cigarette dangling negligently
from his lips. With him are his brothers -~ ANGIE, a
mild-mannered, dopily smiling seventeen year old and

JOEY, fourteen, Bushwood's newest caddy, tough like Tony,
but cuter.

TONY
He accosts one of the maids.

TONY
Hey, Maria! The Immigration guy
was lookin’ for you yesterday.
You know, there's a law if you
screw an Italian, you're an
automatic citizen.

She laughs uncomprehendingly and continues talking in
Spanish to her friends,

Two other caddies have arrived with the D'’Annunzio’s --
GOOFY, a gawky, bespectacled sixteen year old and
MOTORMOUTH, a fast-talking, eighteen year old class clown.

As they cut across the parking lot, they check out the cars
of the club members.

MOTORMOUTH

{like an announcer)
We're here at the Thirteenth Annual
Bushwood Auto Show and what a
collection of four-wheel fantasies
we have here, right Goofy?

(raps a stationwagon)
~- Here's a newcomer to this morning's
show, Mr. and Mrs. Newburger's 1981
Ford Country Square.

GOOFY
Breathtakingly beautiful.

MOTORMOUTH
An absolute hog.

A PORSCHE

A black Porsche Turbo Carrera with prominent "MD" markings
races up the access road toward the parking lot. The driver
has to slam on his brakes to avoid hitting the D'Annunzio's

who are deliberately slow getting out of the way. The
horn honks frantically. The caddies slowly clear the
road as the driver guns his motor. The moment they're
clear, he lurches forward to pass them.

JOEY

He does a flip off the car as if he's been hit and lands
sprawled on the grass.

JOEY
{rolling around
in mock agony)
Yaaaaaaaaaah!
THE PORSCHE
It screeches to a halt. The tinted window WHIRS down
revealing DR. BLAINE BEEPER, a rich, conceited big-city
surgeon. He looks back, shocked.
DR. BEEPER
Oh my God!
JOEY
He's on the grass twitching and flopping, the other
caddies standing around in horror.

THE PORSCHE

Beeper grabs his black doctor's bag and leaps from the car.
He stops.

THE DRIVEWAY

Both Joey and the caddies have disappeared.

BEEPER

He slams his doctor's bag against a tree trunk in a rage and
then looks at it realizing what he's done. He gives the bag

a tentative shake and hears a $6,000 tinkle of broken glass
and instruments.

EXT. CADDYSHACK

Several caddies are lounging in the yard in front of the

caddyshack -- a one-story white frame building with green
tile roof and green shutters. Joey DB'Annunzio practices

hook shots against a backboard attached to the wall.

GOOFY

He's sitting on a bench with RAY, an old, professional caddy
wearing a dirty golf cap with an emblem from the 1946 Buick
Open. His suntanned arms are covered with tatoos. Goffy
dunks doughnuts into his coffee as Ray talks.

RAY
I jumped ship in Hong Kong and
Inade my way to Tibet where I got
on as a looper at this golf club
up there in the Himalayan Mountains.

GOOFY
A looper?
RAY
A caddie -- a jock! So I tell

‘em I'm a pro, so who do they give
me? The Dalai Lama himself ~-
flowin' white robes and everything.
So I give him his driver and he tees
off -- right into this glacier and
his ball goes down this 10,000 foot
crevice. And you know what the
Dalai Lama says?

GOOFY
No.

RAY
‘shit.’ Yeah -- 'Shit!' And you
know what else. I'm full of shit.
Yeah. ~~

Goofy stares at him with his mouth full of doughnut.

DANNY

He crosses the caddyyard. From the way the caddies greet
him, we can see that he's both liked and respected. A
basketball rolls up to him.

JOEY
(shouts)
Hey, Noonan! Little help!

Danny picks up the ball, closes his eyes and takes a hook
shot at the basket.

[LINOUNTMLLIGE CGM

THE BASKET

The ball sails high over the backboard and onto the roof
of the caddyshack.

JOEY

He glares at Danny.

JOEY
Thanks a lot, wipehole!

Danny goes into the caddyshack.

INT. CADDYSHACK

More caddies are lounging on benches, playing cards, etc.
Danny enters and goes to the window of the caddymaster's
office. Tony D'’Annunzio is in the office.

DANNY
(holding up
a ticket)
Hiya, Tony. Where's Lou?

TONY
He went to the Pro Shop for a
minute, You wanna take over till
he gets back?

DANNY
Where you goin'?

Angie, Tony's rat-like brother, appears.

ANGIE
Noonan, you wanna buy some clock
radios?

DANNY
Nah ---

A BENCH

INJUN JOE, a big silent Indian of indeterminate age is playing
a game with FEEB, a twitching adult caddy with just a hint of
mental deficiency. They take turns bowling at wooden tees with
a golf ball, betting on each roll.

FEEB
(to Injun Joe)
Do you have a dime for ten pennies?

ANGIE
{making fun of him)
Hey, Feeb! What do you want a dime
for when you got ten pennies? Ten
is more than one.

FEEB
Pennies only work in the gumball
machine. I want M & M's.
JOEY
(joining Angie)
Here, Feeb. I'11 give it to you.
Feeb holds out the pennies to Joey who slaps his hand,
scattering them all over the caddyshack.

DANNY

He turns to look and sees the little D'Annunzio's bothering
Feeb.

DANNY
{to Tony)
Your brothers are animals.

(shouts at them)
cut it out, moron!

FEEB
He's on his knees looking for his pennies.

INJUN JOE
Here, Feeb. Here’s a dime.

FEEB
Thank you, Injun Joe.

He gets off his knees, but Angie snatches his cap and tosses
it to Joey.

Angie!

Danny turns to Angie.

ANGIE
You want it, Noonan? Take it.

Danny grabs for him but Joey jumps on his back and they go down,
knocking over a gumball machine which breaks and sends gumballs
rolling all over the place. Then Angie jumps on Danny to help
Joey, but Tony arrives and yanks Angie to his feet, cuffing him
sharply a couple of times. Danny gets a good grip on Little
Joey's neck and pastes him to the wall.

Younger caddies scurry around after the pennies and gumballs.
Injun Joe laughs.

THE DOOR

LOU LOOMIS, the Caddymaster, enters. He's a likable master

sergeant type with a veneer of toughness to keep the caddies
in line.

Lou
(over the noise)
Okay, break it up! Pipe down!
All of you!

Angie takes on last wild swing at Danny but accidentally hits
Lou on the arm. The caddies go suddenly quiet. Lou grabs Angie
and pushes him over to a sign on the wall.

No fighting.

Don't you see it? Well, pick it up!

Joey picks it up. Lou addresses all the caddies.

cowed caddics)
Now, I'm not going to have any
trouble from you guys this summer-.
I'll put it right on the line --

already -- fooling around on the

grass. Poor caddying.

So if you want to get fired, just
keep it up.

Somebody belches. Lou turns to Jocy, hands him a kleenex
for his blecdy nose.

LOU
And another thing. If any of you
are thinking of going to college--
Noonan, you may want to listen to
this -- Carl Lipbaum died last
week in summer school from a severe

INT, MEN'S LOCKER ROOM

A cloud of steam billows from the steam room as the door
opens. Several portly members can be seen through the mist.
They lock like ancient Roman senators wrapped in their sheets

locker room, playing cards or changing in and out of golf

DANNY
That's right, Mouth. It's a grueling
test of strength and ignorance.

EXT. THE PRACTICE TEE

Danny approaches the practice tee and sees SAM RIVIERA, the
club's golf pro, finishing a lesson with MR. & MRS. HAVERCAMP.
Sam is about forty, deeply tanned and dressed in pastel golf
sweater and slacks. The Havercamps are a cheerfully senile
old couple, dressed in matching outfits, who keep gamely
trying to hit their practice shots. They succeed only in
gouging deep holes around their golf balls as they repeatedly
swing and miss.

SAM

MAGGIE, a very cute, rosy~checked Irish girl in her early
twenties. When her last customer exits, she turns to the
frozen custard machine, takes the bigger size sugar cone

Softee Freeze. She takes a happy lick and spots Danny coming

Hi, Maggic.

Hi. Don't let the Judge see you.

THE FAIRWAY

SANDY MacFIDDISH, Bushwood's Scottish greenskecpcr, is
standing by his electric utility cart with his tartan tam
in his hands, taking orders from Judge Smails.

SMAILS
(irate)
Do you know what moles can do to
a golf course?

SANDY
They must be tunnclin’ in from
that construction site across
the road.

SMAILS
I don't care where they're coming

keeper. Is that clear?

SANDY
Very clear, sir.

A MOLE

It pops its head out of a hole and cocks its head. Then it
hears a noise and ducks back in.

SANDY

He drags a thick water hose onto the fairway and sticks the
nozzle into the mole hole.

EIGHTEENTH GREEN

Danny comes off the course really exhausted now, followed
by the Havercamps, indomitable despite having played the
worst round of golf imaginable.

Thank you, sir.

DANNY

He trots wearily across a fairway lugging both golf bags.

He trips over Sandy's water hose and falls flat on his face.
The clubs spill out of the bags with a noisy clatter and
two dozen golf balls go rolling off in all directions.

DANNY
(totally exasperated)
God damn son of a bitch!

His anger is cut short as he spots someone walking toward him.

LACEY

Danny sees LACEY UNDERALL, a very beautiful girl, walking
toward him in a short, very alluring tennis skirt. She
has slim, shapely legs, long, golden hair, a great tan and
a cover-girl complexion. She's carrying a tennis racquet
and with one smooth move, she benés slightly and scoops

up one of the golf balls that rolled away from Danny.

LACEY
{tossing the
golf ball to Danny)
Walk much?

DANNY
(stuffing the clubs
back into the bags)
Oh, no. I just -- I was just
resting.

She smiles and walks away with a toss of her curls. Her

walk is both sexy and athletic. She absently brushes a
fly off the back of her thigh with her racquet.

He gapes at her and suddenly water comes shooting up out of
a dozen moleholes, falling like rain on Danny.

EXT. THE TENNIS COURTS

The tennis courts are hidden behind dense bushes but the
pock~pock of balls being hit can be heard as Danny saunters
by. He nods casually to a pair of golfers as they pass,
then as soon as they're gone, Danny ducks into the bushes.

DANNY

We can hear the sound of youthful laughter as Danny peers
through the hurricane fence at the tennis courts.

THE TENNIS COURTS

Lacey is playing with three young club MEMBERS. Her partner
is SPAULDING SMAILS, a pudgy, truculent-looking seventeen year
old -- Judge Smails' spoiled grandson.

Lacey hits a nice backhand, then waits for there turn, but
Spaulding insists on taking the next shot.

SPAULDING
I got it! It's mine!

Lacey backs off relucantly and watches Spaulding hit a
lame forehand right into the net.

THE BUSHES

The TENNIS PRO, a middle-aged, red-faced man wearing whites
and a floppy tennis hat, walks by and sees Danny's ass
sticking out of the bushes. Ue puts down the basket of
practice balls he's carrying, winds up to swing with his
racquet, and swats Danny hard on the backside.

INT’. CLUB KITCHEN

Danny comes flying through the door into a maelstrom of
activity. It's all banging pots, and sizzling stoves with
food and people flying everywhere. He's in a white jacket,
carrying a big tray of dirty dishes.

carves a big roast with a huge butcher knife.

Danny and Maggie bustle over to a service area and start
loading trays with ice water, rolls and butter. Danny
locks around the room and spots Lacey.

LACEY UNDERALL

She's sitting at a table with Judge Smails, his wife

MRS. SMAILS, a Wagnerian dowager, Spaulding Smails, the
Judge's loathsome grandson, Dr. Beeper and his wife, CONNIE
BEEPER who is obviously much too charming and attractive
to be married to a creep like Dr. Beeper.

Lacey looks great in an off-the-shoulder white cotton dress.
Judge Smails is handling the introductions when Danny and
Maggie arrive with the bread and butter.

JUDGE SMAILS

{clasping Lacey's

luscious shoulder}
Lacey Underali, certainly you
remember Dr. and Constance Beeper
from Hope Sound last winter. Lacey's
mother has sent us her daughter for

DANNY
Why?
MAGGIE

Lacey Underall. She's the biggest
whore in Philadelphia...It's all over

Panny looks at Lacey with even greater interest. The NOISE
of a glass breaking startles him.

ANOTHER TABLE

In contrast to the Smails' table, these guests are having a
rollicking good time. It's the FUN COUPLES: SCOTT, GATSBY
and their foxy, tipsy wives, SUKI and WALLY. They are hosting
a new face at Bushwood, AL CZERNAK, a stocky, balding, cement
block in a flaming leisure suit. His voice is loud, his
Manner is deliberately offensive and he seems to really enjoy
the company of these rich, young marrieds.

Danny arrives to clean up the broken glass.

He grabs his cleaver and heads for the door. Two assistants

tackle the enraged alien, knocking over a tower of freshly-
washed pots, causing a tremendous din.

Al Czernak's table bursts into loud applause at the crash
and continued commotion behind the kitchen door.

tremendous crash in the kitchen and spills a few drops

it. A band starts playing in the next room.

INT. CLUB BALLROOM

Members and guests drift into the wood-panelled lounge and
ballroom area. A very boring, six~piece COMBO is playing
a bad Beatle tune at half-speed.

They stop at the edge of the the dance floor with Al Czernak,
watching the club members as they dance sedately.

too close to his pink leisure wear.

The word "DAMAGED" is stamped on the ball in big red letters.
A putter taps the ball out of frame.

Lou, the caddymaster, is chalking the names of the players on a
board near the first tee. The caddies are waiting for their
assignments. Danny looks nervous.

LOU
Okay, Smails, Smails, Beeper and
Bishop Pickering. Who wants it?

The caddies hoot derisively.

DANNY

Uh -- I'll take Smails if no one's

Brown-nose, brown-nose.

Danny gives them the finger as he goes off to caddy.

EXT. FIRST TEE - LATER

The caddies are lazing around the fringes of the first tee area
watching the Smails team greet Beeper and the Bishop. the Bishop's
golf shirt has a small white cross where the alligator should be.

MOTORMOUTH
