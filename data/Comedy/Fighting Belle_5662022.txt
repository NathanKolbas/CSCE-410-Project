FADE IN:

EXT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - SAVANNAH, GEORGIA -- DAY

Wedding GUESTS in hoop skirts and morning suits roam about.
INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

Ten BRIDESMAIDS clad in fuchsia primp and gossip. A FLOWER
GIRL frolics amidst balloons.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- DAY

The room of the consummate beauty pageant contestant. Ina
white hoop skirt stands belle of the ball DELILAH MACINTOSH,
early 20s.

Tending to the bride are: mother MIRABELLE, a domineering
matriarch; bridesmaid CHARLENE, Delilah's older, heavier
sister; and bridesmaid MARNEY, fetching and shallow.

DELILAH
I can't believe my weddin' day is
finally here. In an hour, I'll be
married to the man o' my dreams.
Somebody pinch me.

Charlene pinches her, hard.

DELILAH
Ow! I meant, figuratively.

CHARLENE
I pinched your figure, didn't I?

DELILAH
(pirouettes)
How do I look?

MARNEY
Like you crap diamonds.

MIRABELLE
Marney. I don't appreciate such
language in my house.

MARNEY
Sorry, Mrs. M. It just sort of...
(eyes Delilah in mirror)
slid out.

Delilah holds... then bursts into giggles.
MIRABELLE
(stamps her shoe)
Enough of that! This is your wedding
day for heaven's sake. Not some
tawdry night in a cheap motel.
Charlene, doesn't your sister look
beautiful?

CHARLENE
(admitting defeat)
Yes, Momma.

She crouches to adjust Delilah's skirt.

MARNEY
I feel like a whale in this thing,
just waiting to be harpooned.

CHARLENE
Tell me about it.

MIRABELLE
(pats Marney's arm)
You're not a whale, Honey.

She brushes past Charlene, who reddens.

DELILAH
It's only for a few hours. Then
y'all can get naked, hop on an usher,
and jump in the pool.

MIRABELLE
They will do no such thing.

DELILAH
I'm just teasin', Momma. Try and
relax. You're makin' me nervous.

MIRABELLE
A bride is supposed to be nervous on
her wedding day.

CHARLENE
Like it's a law or something?

MIRABELLE
It is a law. Your family comes
bearing gifts. Don't you want to
make a good impression on them?

MARNEY
How many candle holders you figure
you'll get?
Mirabelle

DELILAH
Enough to start my own cathedral.

MARNEY
I'll tell you what I'd want... a
Naloni Bucintoro watch. That's right.

DELILAH
Aren't you forgettin' somethin'?
MARNEY
What?
DELILAH
Your husband, the guy you'd be
marryin'. Aren't the gifts s'posed

to be for both of you?

MARNEY
Oh please. How much enjoyment is he
gonna get out of a china bowl, or a
crystal flute sitting in a cabinet?
So he might as well be not enjoying
something that makes me happy.

MIRABELLE
We have a philosopher among us. Any
idea when your big day will come?

MARNEY
I kicked Trent to the curb two months
ago, so it probably won't be in the
next few weeks.

gives Marney a look of disdain.

DELILAH
Serves him right for what he done.

CHARLENE
What'd he do?

MARNEY
Made a pass at my mother. I'm still
surprised she told me.

DELILAH
Should've set the bastard on fire
after somethin' like that.

CHARLENE
That's not the answer. Living well's
the best revenge.

DELILAH
Oh? Is that what you did after
Howard?
Charlene narrows her eyes at Delilah and marches out.

MIRABELLE
That was a bit below the corset,
don't you think?

DELILAH
I'm sorry, Momma. After today, she'll
have two weeks to get over it.
(to Marney)
"Fore I lose another bridesmaid, you
mind takin' one o' the programs down

to Kelvin?

MARNEY
Sure. Getting a little humid in
here.

She meanders to the bureau. Ogles the program.

MARNEY
Oh no. Did he have to pose?

INSERT PROGRAM
Delilah stands next to her bridegroom. He puts up his dukes.
INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - GUEST ROOM -- DAY
The bridegroom shadowboxes in front of a mirror. KELVIN
WINGFIELD, 30, the body of a flyweight, the ego of a
heavyweight. A pencil moustache outlines his upper lip.
KELVIN

You want some o' this? Huh? You

want some o' this, Bitch? Cuz I

know you can't handle some o' this.

The BEST MAN, 20s, trades barbs with three ushers: BUCK,
CHUCK and TUCK. They all swig longneck beers.

BEST MAN
Kick that chump's ass, Kel.

The ushers laugh. A knock on the door.

KELVIN
Beers. Finish 'em. Now.

The groomsmen guzzle, toss bottles in the trash. Kelvin
fixes his hair in the mirror.

KELVIN
Come in.

Marney sashays in.
MARNEY
Delilah wanted me to give you this.

KELVIN
What is it?

MARNEY
The program. Can you get with it?

KELVIN
Bring it here. Let me see it.

He motions to his entourage to leave. Marney stomps over.
Best Man shuts the door on his way out.

KELVIN
I didn't get a chance to see it.
(admires his picture)
What do you think of it?

MARNEY
Pretty weak if you ask me.

KELVIN
Weak? There's a word I don't like.
Especially from someone so... eye-
grabbing.

MARNEY

Please. I feel like Orca coming out
of the closet in this thing.

KELVIN
(chuckles)
No, I mean it.

MARNEY
You're a good liar. I can tell.

KELVIN

I'm a fighter, Marney. I can't stand
for lies and I can't stand for
weakness. I pride myself on my
strength.

(puffs out chest)
My agility.

(gyrates like a

Chippendale dancer)
And my ability to... move things.

(presses his junk

against her)

Marney lets out a little squeak. They lock lips, grope at
each other like teenagers in a back seat.

Kelvin spins Marney around, lifts up her skirt.
KELVIN
These hoop skirts were a great idea.
Surprised there even was a war.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- DAY
Delilah's alone, admiring her engagement ring.

FLOWER GIRL (0.S.)
Let go!

BOY'S VOICE (0.S.)
Big Baby!

FLOWER GIRL (0.S.)
Stop it! I'm telling!

Delilah scoots into the
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

just as Flower Girl slaps the RING BEARER, the seed of Chucky
but a smidgen taller, in the face.

DELILAH
Hey! Stop it you two!

Ring Bearer slaps Flower Girl back, knocking her down. She
immediately cries.

DELILAH
Shame on you! Don't you ever do
that again!

Ring Bearer farts with his mouth at Delilah and scrams.

DELILAH
Come back here, you! Don't you ever
hit a lady! You hear me?!

She stoops to Flower Girl, whose face is puffy pink.

DELILAH
Hey, Sweetie. It's alright. Wanna
come with me? Come on, let's go.

She helps her up, escorts her into
DELILAH'S BEDROOM

On the way in, Delilah swipes a hairbrush and a tissue off
her bureau. She directs Flower Girl to a small platform
that stands before an ornate full-length mirror.

DELILAH
We're gonna fix you up, good as new.
(hands tissue)
Here you go, Sweetie.
Flower Girl wipes her eyes. Delilah stands behind her,
brushing her hair.

DELILAH
Wanna know somethin'?

FLOWER GIRL
(sniffling)
What?

She looks up at Delilah's reflection.

DELILAH
I ain't ever seen a prettier flower
girl in my entire life. You know
that? 'Deed, it's true. Look at
this hair. Bet it drives all the
boys wild. They're just not sure
why yet. Wait until it gets long.
You'll have to beat 'em off with a
curlin' iron. There. All better.
Now, wanna come see me get married?

EXT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - BACKYARD - WEDDING TENT -- DAY

The Guests chat boisterously on rows of folding chairs,
separated by an aisle of manicured grass. A brass QUINTET
occupies the final row.

TUBA
Try not to screw it up this time.

FRENCH HORN
Blow it out your arse.

CENTER STAGE

The MINISTER, 50s, emerges in a gray suit and red bow tie.
Smiles at the large gathering.

Kelvin appears, looking a bit disheveled, buttons his jacket.
The Quintet plays PRELUDE MUSIC.

KELVIN
How's it going?

MINISTER
Good. Thank you for asking. Feeling
a bit nervous?

KELVIN
No, actually. I'm quite relaxed.

MINISTER
Splendid.

The PROCESSION begins.
Buck escorts Mirabelle and KELVIN'S MOM, 50s, a museum of
Silicone and collagen, to their seats in the front row.

Best Man follows, arm in arm with the Maid of Honor, Charlene.
He waves like he's just arrived on Oscar night.

Chuck and Tuck strut down the aisle.

CHUCK
You and Jezebel thinking of getting
married?

TUCK

Her name's Jesselyn, jackass.

CHUCK
Jesselyn Jackass. I like it.

The Bridesmaids, including a rumpled Marney, parade in pairs.
Behind them, the Ring Bearer, looking sweaty and confused.

And then, the Flower Girl. She freckles the aisle with
magnolia petals.

Ring Bearer turns and gives her a dirty look. She proudly
produces her tongue for him.

A pregnant pause. Anticipation builds amongst the Guests.
The Quintet strikes up Mendelssohn's WEDDING MARCH.
Delilah appears with her father, SAMUEL, 50s, silver hair
and a downward smile, a keeper of many secrets. The bride
carries a bouquet of pink magnolias.

They proceed down the aisle. Flashbulbs and smiles light up
the tent. Kelvin steals a look at Marney, who blushes.

CHUCK
(whispers)
Think they did it?
BEST MAN
Course they did, look at her. She's
as pink as a baboon's ass.
The Minister turns to the Best Man, shocked.

BEST MAN
Sorry, Your Honor.

Kelvin sneers at Mirabelle and Charlene, both looking bloated
and uncomfortable as they fan themselves.

Delilah and Samuel arrive at the altar.
MINISTER
Who gives this woman in marriage?

SAMUEL
I do.

Samuel kisses Delilah's cheek, puts her hand in Kelvin's.
He takes a seat next to Mirabelle.

MINISTER
Dearly Beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God to
join together this Man and this Woman
in holy Matrimony. If any man- or
woman- can show just cause, why they
may not lawfully be joined together,
let him- or her- now speak or forever
hold their peace.

Marney has a COUGHING fit. A murmur ripples through the
crowd. Delilah scowls at her.

CHUCK
Is she gagging on something?

BEST MAN
But he's standing all the way over
here.

BUCK
Shut up.

Kelvin and Delilah face each other.

MINISTER
Kelvin, wilt thou have this woman as
thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy
estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou love
her, comfort her, honor, and keep
her in sickness and in health; and,
forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto her, so long as ye both shall
live?

KELVIN
I... been doing some thinking.

GASPS from the crowd nearly bring down the tent.

USHERS
Woops.

DELILAH
What?
10.

KELVIN
Look...

Delilah's eyes bug as Kelvin searches for the right words.

KELVIN
I'm a fighter, Delilah. I can't
stand for lies and I can't stand for
weakness. I pride myself on --

DELILAH
What in God's name are you talkin'
about?

KELVIN

I think I got a few more good rounds
in me. And I just don't think I'm
ready to hang up my belt. Capeesh?

DELILAH
I'll show you capeesh.

She swings at him with her left. Kelvin slips her punch.

A right from Delilah. He slips it again.

She winds up and delivers a roundhouse left. Kelvin slips
her punch for a third time, only this time, Delilah trips on
her train and collapses. She CLONKS her head on the stage.

GUEST
My God! Is she alright?!

Mirabelle faints. Delilah's out like a light. The Minister
stoops down to assist. He peers up at Kelvin but he's gone.

The bridegroom leaves with his entourage.

BEST MAN
Another TKO from the K-man.

The Guests stand with their mouths agape. Some shout: "Where
are you going?" And "You forgot your bride." Children Boo.

LATER
Mirabelle holds smelling salts under Delilah's nose.

DELILAH
(opens her eyes)
Yeckh, what is that? Get that thing
away from me.

MIRABELLE
A little gratitude would be nice.
I've never done this before.
11.

Delilah sits up. Nearly everyone has left. It begins to
sink in: The Wedding That Never was.

Charlene and Marney sit in the first row looking despondent.
Samuel approaches Delilah, kneels down next to her.

SAMUEL
Are you alright, Honeybee? Let me
help you up.
MIRABELLE
Leave her be! She needs to do it
herself.
Samuel backs off.
DELILAH

(slowly stands)
What happened?

MIRABELLE
You mean you don't remember? He
left you. The one wearing the tuxedo.

DELILAH
Thanks, Momma. That helps.

SAMUEL
I think Delilah could do without the
snide remarks right now.

MIRABELLE
What do you know about it? Do you
know what went into putting on this
wedding day?!

SAMUEL
I think I do. I paid for it.

MIRABELLE
That's just marvelous. And what did
I invest? Nothing at all, right?!
Only the fancy wedding invitations,
and the registry, and that Godforsaken
rehearsal dinner --

SAMUEL
I just think --

MIRABELLE
Those God-awful programs, and the
fittings, and the million alterations
on those bloody hoop skirts, and the
guest list, and the thank you cards --

SAMUEL
Don't you think --
12.

MIRABELLE
And the photographer, and the
videographer, and the caterer, and
the minister, and the florist, and
the band, and that fat slob chauffeur
brother of yours, AND a five thousand
dollar cake that nobody ate!

SAMUEL
Yes, but, this wasn't Delilah's fault.

Mirabelle huffs and storms off. Samuel watches her leave.
He takes a seat, dizzy and disconcerted.

Delilah turns to her sister and Marney.

DELILAH
This isn't really happenin', right?

MARNEY
I'm sorry, Honey.

A hint of a smile appears on Charlene's face. She looks
away, trying to hide it.

DELILAH
Is somethin' funny?

CHARLENE
No.

DELILAH

Then why are you smilin'?

CHARLENE
Nothing. It's nothing.

DELILAH
I bet I look pretty funny, huh?
"When Beauty Queen Weddings Go Wrong."
Right? Fox is gonna be all over my
ass now. Real funny, Charlene.

Charlene can't hold it any longer. She bursts out laughing.
CHARLENE
I'm sorry, Delilah.
(scampers away)

DELILAH
Some family.

Samuel gives her a pained look. Delilah sits next to Marney.
13.

DELILAH
This was so humiliatin'. There ain't
no comin' back from somethin' like
this.

MARNEY
You will, Sweetie. Might not feel
like it now, but... you'll see. The

sun will come up tomorrow, right?
Isn't that what the 1i'l orphan girl
says?

DELILAH
I just wanna beat him senseless.

MARNEY
You could do that. But that'll just
get you thrown in jail for assault
"n battery. It's not worth it.

DELILAH
How could he do that to me?

MARNEY
Honey, men like Kelvin are a dime a
baker's dozen. Crying over somebody
like that, well... that's just foolish
if you ask me. You can do better.

Delilah spies the wedding cake in the corner of the tent.

MARNEY
I swear to you...

Delilah charges at the cake like a belle out of hell. She
flails at it, stirring up a whirlwind of icing.

DELILAH
(mocking Kelvin)
You been doin' some thinkin', huh?!
You couldn't think up a brain fart!
I'll give you somethin' to think
about !

Strawberry mousse splatters all over her hoop skirt as she
punches away. Samuel buries his head in his hands.

Delilah snatches the figurine of Kelvin atop the cake and
flings it into the trees.

DELILAH
Smallest pecker I've ever seen!

Marney raises her eyebrows, confused by the comment. Delilah
looks down at herself, thoroughly covered in cake. Perhaps
a moment of clarity. Then, shamelessly, she licks herself.
14.

Mirabelle and Charlene pop back into the tent. They get an
eyeful of Delilah going to town on the cake. Her indulgence
verges on pornography.

MIRABELLE
(aghast)
Oh my word.

CHARLENE
(salivating)
Oh my word.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- DAY

Remnants of a wedding cake and dress decorate the floor.
Delilah lies dormant on her bed, face first into her pillow.

The ALARM CLOCK goes off: the sound of a Boxing Fight Bell.
Delilah reaches her hand out and shuts it off.

SUPER: ONE WEEK LATER

Delilah, still in bed. One-gallon buckets of ice cream have
been hollowed out. They sit sadly on the floor by the bed.

Her phone rings, Delilah reaches for it.

DELILAH
Hello.

BRIDESMAID (V.O.)
Delilah? It's me, Cassandra. How're
you holding up?

DELILAH
I'm fine.

An empty pint of ice cream falls off the end of the bed. A
silver spoon rattles on the floor.

BRIDESMAID (V.O.)
Listen... I'm not gonna be able to
make it to that picnic on Sunday...

DELILAH
But we've been plannin' that for a
month.

BRIDESMAID (V.0O.)
I know, but... something just came
up, and uhh... I'm sorry, but I can't.

DELILAH
Oh. What came up?
15.
BRIDESMAID (V.O.)
Umm... I'm just not comfortable
talking about it.
DELILAH
Okay. Bye...
(hangs up)
SUPER: ONE WEEK LATER
Delilah, still in bed. Pizza boxes have joined the empty
ice cream containers on the floor. One box, half-eaten,
sits squarely on Delilah's wedding dress.

Her alarm clock goes off. Delilah flings it across the room.
She returns her face to the pillow and shuts her eyes.

Slowly, her eyes open again. They focus ona
FRAMED PICTURE

of Kelvin boxing in the ring.

Delilah picks it up and studies it. An epiphany.

DELILAH
Assault 'n battery, my hot ass.

From under her bed, she pulls out the Yellow Pages.
INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - KITCHEN -- DAY

Delilah saunters in. Her hair a tangled, greasy mess.
Mirabelle and Charlene eat breakfast at the table.

DELILAH
Mornin'. How y'all doin'?
CHARLENE
We're okay. How are you?
DELILAH
(strolls to counter)
I feel rejuvenated. 'Deed, I do.

There's a renaissance goin' on in my
pajamas as we speak.

CHARLENE
Okaaay.

She turns to her mother like Delilah might be nuts.
MIRABELLE

Delilah, I didn't raise you to talk
like that.
Delilah pours herself a glass of orange juice.

DELILAH

You know somethin', Momma? You are
ab-so-lute-ly right. You taught me
to speak proper, act like a lady,
drown all my sorrows in iced tea,
and take action when the need calls
for it. And you know what? That's
exactly what I'm gonna do.

MIRABELLE
What are you talking about, for
heaven's sake?

DELILAH
(downs her juice)
Y'all are lookin' at the first female
boxer in all the MacIntosh family.

Mirabelle EXPLODES with laughter. Charlene looks at her

mother terrified.

DELILAH
That's right. You laugh. But I'm
tellin' you right now... I'm gonna

box my way up the ranks and beat the
bejesus outta his skinny-little ass.
Give 'im a taste of humiliation he
won't soon forget.

CHARLENE
You're saying you're gonna box Kelvin.

DELILAH
That's exactly what I'm sayin', 0
Sister O' Mine.

CHARLENE
That's insane. He'd kill you.

DELILAH
That's where you're wrong, my sweet
1i'l dumplin'. Hell hath no fury
like a beauty queen scorned. You
just remember that.

EXT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

Delilah parks her pink 1970 Mini Cooper in the lot.
wears a fuchsia sweat suit and matching makeup.

INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

16.

The THUMPING of heavy bags, the STACCATO hammering of speed

bags. A few weight benches sit in a far corner.
17.

In an 18' x 18' ring, female boxer SLICE, 30s and lean with
reddish hair, spars with an OPPONENT.

Ringside is TANDY BURROWS. She's 30, buff with a harsh Boston
accent, her glinty eyes have seen more than their share.

TANDY
Christ, Slice, keep your chin down!

Delilah flits in carrying her fuchsia purse. Unsure where
to go, she approaches Tandy.

DELILAH
Excuse me. Where do I --

TANDY
Can't you fuckin' see I'm busy?

DELILAH
Oh, I'm... sorry.

TANDY
Go pahk your ass ova there.

Delilah ambles to the opposite side of the ring. Many of
the GYM-GOERS give her the once-over. TWO of them snigger
as they toss a medicine ball back and forth.

In the ring, Slice is throttled by two left hooks. Delilah
looks on as Slice retaliates, hammering her Opponent.

TANDY
Take it easy, you're losing your
shit!
Slice doesn't seem to hear, or care. Throws a rabbit punch.

TANDY
Time!

She enters the ring livid, stomps straight over to Slice.

TANDY
What did I tell you about keeping
your cool?

SLICE

I wasn't pissed off.

TANDY
Bull-shit. You lost it. I already
told you. If you get mad, you get
crazy, and if you get crazy, you're
gonna end up in a hospital. I'm not
having that here. This ain't about
emotion. It's about heart. You
better learn the difference.

 
18.

One more hard look through Slice and Tandy exits the ring.
A look of concern sweeps over Delilah's face.

TANDY
If you're looking for the mall, you
head straight down Fahm, then --

DELILAH
I'm aware where the mall is, thank
you.

TANDY

Whaddya want, then?

DELILAH
Is this your gym?

TANDY
Better fuckin' believe it.

DELILAH
My name's Delilah MacIntosh. It's
nice to meet you.

She puts out her hand, comes up empty.

TANDY
You running for office?

DELILAH
Nope. I'm campaignin' to be a boxer.

TANDY
Good God No.

INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM - OFFICE -- DAY

On the walls, a tribute to the female boxer. Tandy sits
with her feet up behind a desk, squeezing a tennis ball in
each hand. Delilah fills out an application on a clipboard.

DELILAH
I never got your name.

TANDY
Tandy. So what brings a girl like
you to boxing?

DELILAH
Well... I'm a graduate of Norton
Beauty College. I've got my
manicurist license, as well as my
cosmetology license.

(MORE )
19.

DELILAH
I won the Miss Georgia beauty pageant
two years ago. And um, this year,
I'm the Magnolia Princess.

TANDY
So... what brings a girl like you to
boxing?

DELILAH

Oh. I wanted to change career paths.
Uh huh. I mean, beauty's only skin
deep, right? That's what they always
say. 'N who knows, maybe they're
right. Workin' in an office is just
not my thing. I'd die if I had to
sit in a cube all day, wouldn't you?

Tandy looks dizzy, rubs the confusion from her eyes.

TANDY
You married?

Delilah covers her engagement ring.

DELILAH
No. Still single.

TANDY
Well, Delilah, I gotta warn you.
Boxing's a far cry from doing the
friggin' catwalk. Ya follow me? It
can get pretty brutal out there.

DELILAH
Dangit! An eyelash got in my eye.
Just a sec.

Slyly, she slips off her engagement ring, drops it into her
pocketbook, and takes out her compact.

DELILAH
Lately, my eyelashes seem to have a
mind o' their own. I dunno what's
goin' on with them.

TANDY
Yeah, I can see how that might be
hard.

She smirks at Delilah as she fishes for an eyelash.
20.

DELILAH
(closes her compact)
Miss Tandy. I don't wanna
inconvenience you, truly I don't.
But I do know that if I'm gonna box,
I'm sure as hellfire gonna need
someone to train me.

TANDY
Amen to that.

DELILAH
So if it's not too much trouble...
you think you might be up for it?

TANDY
Why me?
DELILAH
Why you?
TANDY
Yeah, why'd you pick me?
DELILAH
Well um... I heard you were the best,
so... why would I settle for somethin'

less?
Tandy raises an eyebrow.

DELILAH
Is my hair a mess? I'm sorry. It
was real windy on the way in here.

TANDY

Delilah, your resume's pretty damn
impressive, I'll give you that. But
I don't see how beauty pageants and
a manicure license qualify you as a
boxer. Boxing's about discipline.
Not how pretty you look. I think
you should stick with what you're
good at. You're just not cut out
for something like this.

DELILAH
You know what? That's where you're
wrong. You have any idea what it
takes to win a beauty pageant? Do
you? A million miles on the
treadmill, all the food you can't
eat, can't drink, can't smoke, don't
smile too much or you might get laugh
lines, takin' vitamins every day,

(MORE )
21.

DELILAH
minerals, herbs, flaxseed, grapeseed,
whatever-seed, and still try to find
a way to sleep eight hours a night
when all you can think about is that
chocolate fudge cake sittin' in the
fridge. Don't let the mascara and
eyeliner fool you, Miss Tandy. I'm
all about discipline. Now are you
gonna train me or what?

Tandy stares at Delilah in silence. She pulls out a notepad
and pen, scribbles.

TANDY
There's things you're gonna need.
You can pick 'em up at Jesse's around
the corner. Be here tomorrow at
eight. And when you get here, could
you be a little less... pink?

INT. ATHLETIC STORE -- DAY

Delilah pushes a shopping cart loaded with neon sweats and t-
shirts. She swipes a salmon sweatshirt off a shelf.

DELILAH
Nope. Too pink.

A SALESPERSON, 20s, with a bump on his nose, approaches.

BUMPY

How might I help you, ma'am?
DELILAH

Oh, hi. I need a big bag.
BUMPY

A what?
DELILAH

A big bag. You know, for boxin'.

BUMPY
Oh, you mean a heavy bag.

DELILAH
That's right.

BUMPY
Right. Follow me.
(rolls eyes)
22.

Delilah follows him down an aisle.

DELILAH
I'm gonna be a boxer. Isn't it great?

BUMPY
Um, yeah. Good for you.

He stops in front of a row of black and brown heavy bags.

BUMPY

We have these here. They're well-
manufactured and --

DELILAH
Do you have anythin' happier?

BUMPY
Happier.

DELILAH
Yeah. I mean, look at these. They're
all so dull-lookin'.
(points to brown one)
This one looks like King Kong had an
accident. Who wants to see that?

BUMPY
Miss, I hope you don't mind my asking,
but, why boxing? I mean, look at
you. You're a knockout.

DELILAH
Ha!

BUMPY
Guess I stepped into that one. Look,
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we don't
have any happier-looking heavy bags.

DELILAH
That's too bad.

BUMPY
Can I interest you in a slam, ma'am?

DELILAH
What?!

She PUNCHES him in the nose.
23.

BUMPY
Ow!

He keels over, blood trickles from his nose.

DELILAH
How could you say a thing like that
to me?

BUMPY
You heard me wrong. I said a
SlamMan.

DELILAH
Oh. Huh?

MOMENTS LATER

Delilah stands face to face with a SLAMMAN, a freestanding
heavy bag shaped like the head and torso of a man.

Bumpy holds a pink t-shirt to his nose. Delilah gives SlamMan
the evil eye.

DELILAH
I'll take ‘im.

INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

Delilah strides in wearing yellow sweats. She carries an
oversized gym bag.

INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM - LOCKER ROOM -- DAY
Delilah sidles past THREE SWEATY WOMEN on their way out.
SWEATY
No breakfast, and she comes in looking
like a banana split.

SWEATIER
Heh. Watch out.

SWEATIEST
I got Cool Whip at home.

Delilah crams her gym bag into a locker. She turns to leave
and on the wall she notices a

SIGN: People Steal So Use Your Head.

Delilah frowns, turns the dial on the combination lock. She
pulls out her gym bag, removes her pocketbook from inside.
Takes out her engagement ring. She studies it, debates
whether to pocket it. Tosses the ring into the locker.
24.
EXT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM - PARKING LOT -- DAY
Delilah jumps rope. Tandy supervises.
The rope gets tangled up in her feet and she tumbles.

DELILAH
Darnit!

TANDY
Rope's too long for ya. Stand on it
with both feet and pull up.

Delilah steps on the rope, the ends touch her shoulders.

TANDY
Let me see it.

She takes the rope and shortens it.

TANDY
Now try.

Delilah skips. Better this time.

DELILAH
Why aren't we boxin'?
TANDY
You ain't in no fuckin' shape to
box.
DELILAH
What? I'm skinny.
TANDY

Don't talk, Goldilocks. Just jump.
EXT. TRACK -- DAY

Delilah scampers around the track, breathing heavily. Tandy
sips a Coke as she strolls along the grassy center.

DELILAH
You know. I just have to say. That
is pretty tacky. You sippin' a soda
while I sweat my mammaries off.

TANDY
I'm gonna go grab some rum from my
trunk. Be right back.

Delilah growls. Tandy strides away.
MOMENTS LATER

Tandy glides toward the track. Delilah's doubled over,
searching for air.
25.

TANDY
Looks like we got quite a fuckin'
ways to go, don't we. Why were you
running so fast? Your pantalets on
fire? You gotta pace yourself.
Delilah stands upright. Dark mascara streams down her cheeks.

TANDY
Fuckin' fright night.

EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

Tandy idles in her Mustang. She revs the motor. Delilah
trudges toward her, her cheeks still streaked.

TwO BELLES look on from a parked Lexus.
INT. LEXUS -- DAY
They slurp milk shakes.

VANILLA
You hear about what happened to her?

STRAWBERRY
Yup. It's a shame.

VANILLA
Sure is.

STRAWBERRY

Never thought she'd go Goth though.
INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

Delilah drags in behind Tandy and heads for the locker room.

TANDY

Where ya going, Goldilocks?
DELILAH

Home.
TANDY

We're not done yet. Get your ass
over here. I want ya to meet some
o' the regulars.

Tandy leads Delilah over to HANK, 20s, Korean heavyweight, a
perfect gentleman but in no danger of making the cover of

GQ; and ROMEO, 20s, African-American, with flamboyant trunks.
Hank fields Romeo's punches with focus mitts.

TANDY
Guys, this here's Delilah.
26.

Slice sneers at Delilah as she destroys the heavy bag.

SLICE
You takin' in strays from the Junior
League?

TANDY

I'm training Goldilocks here to box.

SLICE
Yeah, and I'm training my dog to
shit in the toilet.

DELILAH
So nice to meet you.

HANK
Don't let her bother you. I'm Hank.

He offers a gloved hand to Delilah, and in the process misses
a punch from Romeo to the kisser. It barely registers.

DELILAH
It's a pleasure. Didn't that hurt?
HANK
It's no problem. He misses all the
time.
ROMEO

Oh hush. My name's Romeo. I could
never wear that color yellow, but it
looks divine on you.

DELILAH
Thank you so much. I like your
shorts. Where'd you find that color?
I didn't see any like it at Jesse's.

ROMEO
Oh, I made these myself. I'd be
happy to make you a --

TANDY
(claps)
Alright, ladies. This ain't a
friggin' fashion show. I gotta teach
Delilah here some basics. C'mere.

Slice bares her teeth at Delilah, hits the bag with a flurry
of punches. Delilah blanches and scurries over to Tandy.

TANDY
Stand in front o' the mirror so you
can see what you're doing. Put your
feet like this.

(MORE )
27.

TANDY
(demonstrates)
You're a rightie, so lead with your
left. Feet shoulder-width apart.
Put your fists up.

Delilah crouches like she's got a load in her pants.

TANDY
Don't bend so far. You're not in
the bathroom. We're gonna start off
slow. Just jab with your left,
(jabs)
punching straight out from your chin.

Delilah clenches her fists and punches wildly.

DELILAH
Like that?

TANDY
Don't clench your fist. Keep your
fingers relaxed.
(jabs in slow-motion)
Straight from the chin. Then squeeze
right before ya reach your target.

Delilah jabs again. A little better.

TANDY
Okay. Now this time, turn your fist
a little when you punch.
(shows her)
Like that. So ya go from holding
your fist vertical to horizontal.

DELILAH
(jabs again)
Better?
TANDY

Just keep doing it. Watch yourself
in the mirror. I'm sure you can
manage that.

Slice stalks over to Tandy as Delilah jabs away.

SLICE
Why you humoring the poor girl?

TANDY
There's something there. It's just
buried under a pile o' grits.
28.
INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

Vacant. Delilah treks in alone. She opens her locker and
pulls out her gym bag.

No sign of an engagement ring. A little grin.
INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Delilah slogs in, flicks on the light. Sticking out like a
sore thumb in the center of the room is SlamMan.

She drops her gym bag on the floor, notices a STICKY NOTE on
SlamMan's forehead: "We Need To Talk."

INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

Delilah, in a sea foam green sweatsuit with matching
sweatband, practices her jab in front of the mirror. No
makeup today. Romeo passes on his way to the ring.

ROMEO
Looking good there.

DELILAH
Thanks!

Tandy emerges from her office, frowns at Delilah's form.

TANDY
Keep your chin tucked, Goldilocks.
This ain't no beauty pageant. Snap
it out and pull it back.

She stands next to Delilah in the mirror, demonstrates.

TANDY
Snap it out. Pull it back. Fast.
Let your punch hang and you'll fuckin'
get pummeled.

Delilah picks up the pace.

TANDY
You're gonna throw this punch the
most, so ya sure as shit better make
it count. Now show me your right.

Delilah swings a roundhouse right.

TANDY
What are ya, breaking up a bar fight?
Throw the punch straight. That's
why they call it a straight right.
(demonstrates)
This time, the power's not coming
from your arm.
29.

DELILAH
It's not?

TANDY
Nope. It's coming from your torso,
(places her hands on
Delilah's torso)
and from your right foot when ya
pivot.

Delilah tries a few straight rights.

TANDY
Put your back into it.

Delilah adds more oomph.

TANDY
Good. Explode 'n pull back. Think
you're ready for the heavy bag?

DELILAH
Oh, I'm ready.

TANDY
(pulls out wraps)
Gimme your hands.

Tandy starts wrapping Delilah's hand. Stops, inspects
Delilah's long, perfectly manicured nails.

TANDY
Follow me. We're going on a field
trip.

DELILAH
Really?

TANDY'S OFFICE
Tandy pulls out a pair of tiny scissors from her desk.

TANDY
Those claws gotta go.

DELILAH
(hides her hands)
Bite your tongue. You know how much
work it takes to keep my hands lookin'
like this? I been cultivatin' these
nails since I was fourteen.

TANDY
You wanna farm or you wanna box?

Delilah stands her ground.
30.

TANDY
Alright. But no boxer I know's got
nails like that.
(puts scissors away)
I guess you know best...

DELILAH
Fine, you win.

She holds out her hands, shuts her eyes.

DELILAH
But be quick about it.

Tandy cuts Delilah's nails. Pink half-moons fall to the
floor.

Tandy gets to work wrapping Delilah's left hand.

TANDY
Hook your thumb, wrap your wrist,
your knuckles, then back to your
thumb. Cross over, wrap your knuckles
again, and tie it off at the wrist.
You do your right.

Delilah gives it a shot. She doesn't use enough tension,
the wrap droops from her hand.

TANDY

You're a little too loose.
DELILAH

No I'm not.
TANDY

I'm talking about the wrap.

DELILAH
Oh.

Tandy takes hold of Delilah's right hand. Wraps it snug.

TANDY
Now put your gloves on.

Delilah slides her hand into a bag glove.

TANDY
Dig your hand in there deep. Like
you're fishing for change.

DELILAH
(pushes in deeper)
Oh. What is that?
31.

TANDY
What?

DELILAH
I think I found a quarter.

TANDY
Let's go.

She leads Delilah back out to a
HEAVY BAG
next to one Slice is pounding on.

TANDY
We're starting with jabs. Remember
your stance. Make sure ya hit the
bag with the front of your fist, not
the top. That'll hurt like a son-of-
a-bitch.

Delilah jabs at the bag once, then again while the bag tails
away. She loses her balance and tumbles. She starts to get
up, embarrassed, and the bag hits her FLUSH on the way back.

SLICE
(laughs)
You really showed him.

Tandy helps Delilah up, glares at Slice.

TANDY
Mind your own business.
(to Delilah)
Wait 'til the bag swings back before
ya hit it again. Make it work for
you, not the other way around.

DELILAH
Like this?
(wallops the bag)
Take that!
(again)
And that!

TANDY
Good. But don't get so pissed off.
Clean out your ears, cuz this is
important. A boxer who goes in mad,
comes out hurt. Ten times out of
ten. Boxing's about discipline.
This ain't the WF.

DELILAH
World Wildlife --
32.

TANDY
Forget I said it. It's all about
control. Control, and skill. That
builds discipline. Capeesh?

Delilah's eyes GLOW with the last word. She unleashes a
diabolical flurry of punches on the heavy bag. Everyone
stops and gawks at Delilah's demonstration. Except Slice.
EXT. SAVANNAH STREET -- DAY

Still in her green sweatsuit, Delilah jogs. Exhausted, but
smiling, on a high from hitting the bag.

She nears a fruit stand where fresh peaches are on display.
Snags one as she passes by. Grins at the startled VENDOR.

DELILAH
Oh no! I'm stealin' a peach. Better
call the fuzz.
The Vendor gapes at her as she runs away. Delilah turns...

DELILAH
Catch!

She hurls the peach back, but misses the Vendor by a mile.

DELILAH
Oops. Sorry!

She trots back to him. Fishes a dollar from her fanny pack.
VENDOR
Where I come from, throwing food is
a sin.
Delilah hands him another dollar.
DELILAH
Promise you'll light a candle for
me?
INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

Delilah, in bright orange sweats and a halter top, works the
heavy bag. She appears tight. Tandy sidles up to her.

TANDY
Can I ask you something? Why are ya
holding your breath?

Delilah stops, exhales a gust of wind. Tandy steps back,
waving her hand in the air to redirect the odor.

TANDY
Somebody bring this girl a Tic Tac.
33.

DELILAH
Sorry. Too many shallots on my grits.

TANDY
Whatever. Ya still wanna breathe,
right? Breathe out when ya punch.
Short little wheeze. Like this.

She wheezes for Delilah.

DELILAH
Should I call someone? Sounds like
you're havin' a heart attack.

TANDY
Do it with me.

Delilah wheezes quietly. Tandy beckons for more. She takes
it up a notch. Or two. Or three.

The two begin to wheeze in harmony, and the Gym-goers find
it impossible to resist. EVERYONE begins to wheeze, until
it sounds like the entire gym may enter into cardiac arrest.

Tandy holds up a stop sign with her hand, the wheezing stops.

TANDY
We're taking another field trip.

She waves two tickets, tucks them into Delilah's halter top.

TANDY
There's a local tournament tonight.
It's a good idea for you to watch.
Learn how it goes down in a real

fight.

DELILAH
That's so sweet. Y'all're comin'
with me?

TANDY

How many tickets ya see there?
INT. ARENA -- NIGHT
FIGHTERS trade punches in the ring. The crowd is subdued.
TANDY
The guy in blue's got a mean fuckin'
left hook. Ya get yourself one o'
those and you'll be dangerous.

DELILAH
I like how he dances.
34.

TANDY
It's called long rhythm. We'll cover
that later.

DELILAH

So, Tandy, what brought you to boxin'?
Tandy's eyes are fixed on the fight.
TANDY

I needed a new fuckin' trail. Or
path. Or whatever.

DELILAH

What were you doin' before?
TANDY

I was a snake-charmer.
DELILAH

A what?
TANDY

What's done is done.

The fight BELL dings, ending the bout. Delilah spots Marney
in the crowd.

DELILAH
Marney!

Marney turns, more alarmed than surprised. She slinks over.

MARNEY
Hey, Delilah. What're you doing
here?

DELILAH

I'm here with my trainer. She's
teachin' me how to box.

MARNEY
Wow, sO you were serious about that?

DELILAH
You know it. What about you?

MARNEY
Oh, um, I just wanted to try something
different. I'll see you later, okay?
She turns on a dime and skedaddles.

DELILAH
That sure ended in a hurry.
35.

ANNOUNCER (0.S.)

Our next bout is in the flyweight
division. In this corner, wearing
red trunks, weighing in at one hundred
and eleven pounds, Beau Sommers.

(crowd cheers)
And in this corner, wearing green
trunks, weighing in at one hundred
and ten pounds, Sir Kelvin Wingfield.

Delilah's head whips around.

DELILAH
That bastard.
TANDY
What?
DELILAH
Oh. Um... the one in green.
TANDY
What about 'im?
DELILAH
I bought that same color the other
day, that... copycattin'... jackass.
TANDY
(chortles)
Whadda you care? Afraid you might
clash?
DELILAH

No. I'm not afraid.
INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

Hank holds the heavy bag as Delilah, in electric blue sweats,
slugs away. Tandy looks on. Delilah's getting better, mixing
in some left hooks and uppercuts with her jabs.

TANDY
More power with the uppercut. Punch
from your legs.

Delilah dips and thrusts a whopper of an uppercut.

TANDY
Good! Show me another hook.

She delivers a few ineffectual left hooks.
She steps

36.

TANDY
Let me show ya something.
(steps up to the bag)
Take the ball of your left foot, and
plant it like you're putting out a
cigarette.

DELILAH
Good idea. I hate cigarettes.

TANDY
Then pivot your body to the right.
Legs, hips, back. All of it. Like
a gate swinging from a post.
(throws a few hooks)

out of the way and Delilah takes a crack at it.

TANDY
Don't worry about looking funny.
Tuck your hand to your chest when ya
come around. Snap it out, and
recover. Don't leave yourself open.

Delilah generates more torque as she practices her hook.

Romeo jumps rope on the platform.

She leads
RING

and pulls

ROMEO
You go, darlin'!
DELILAH
Oh Romeo, Romeo... what for ow thou...

I dunno, whatever...

TANDY
Okay, let's talk defense.

Delilah to the

on gloves. Tosses Delilah her headgear.

DELILAH
We're fightin'?

TANDY
Hell no. We're gonna practice slips.
I'm gonna throw some punches, and
you're gonna avoid them. If ya can.

Delilah puts on her headgear.
37.

TANDY
Cinch it on tight.
(assists her)
Now, I want ya to watch my body.
Every punch your opponent misses,
costs her some energy, right? See
where my next punch is coming from,
then move your head outta the way.

She throws a soft jab at Delilah's head, she evades it.

TANDY
Good. Keep your eyes on mine.

Throws a left hook, Delilah steps out of the way.
TANDY
This ain't dodgeball. Don't use
your feet. Only your head.
She throws more punches, a little faster now.
TANDY
The idea's to avoid the attack, but
use as little energy as possible.
Delilah's into it, bobbing her head back and forth.

DELILAH
This is kinda fun.

Tandy puts a little more power behind her punches and POPS
Delilah in the mouth.

DELILAH
Owwwwwwwwwww !
(falls to her knees)

TANDY
Oh shit.

She squats next to Delilah, pulls her hand away from her
mouth. Blood pours from a cut on Delilah's lip.

TANDY
Somebody get me a towel!

INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

Delilah sits on a gurney, enclosed by a privacy curtain.
She holds a white towel to her lip.

She looks down at her hand and notices the impression left
by her engagement ring. Delilah brings the towel down and
tries to wipe away the mark.
38.

The curtain opens wide and in walks Doctor NATE MORE, 30s,
widowed, and hasn't combed his hair since.

NATE
Are you here for stitches?

DELILAH
Oh God, please no. I've never had
stitches 'fore in my life.

NATE
Hold on. Let's have a look.
(pulls up a stool)
I'm Doctor More. Delilah, is it?

DELILAH
That's right.

NATE
That's a little intimidating. I
haven't had a haircut in months.

Delilah makes a scissoring motion with her fingers.

NATE
(chuckles)
So what brings you here?

DELILAH
I was involved in a boxin' accident.

NATE
A boxing accident.
(walks to counter)

DELILAH
Uh huh. I was learnin' how to do
The Slip, and I zigged when I
should've zagged.
Nate drips solution onto a cotton ball.
NATE
That's too bad. I've got some good
news for you though.
He leans in and cleanses the wound.

DELILAH
What's that?

NATE
No stitches.

Delilah unabashedly hugs Nate's head, he nearly tumbles.
39.

DELILAH
That's so great! Thank you so much.

NATE
(nose to nose)
Be sure to keep it dry.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Delilah turns on the light, tosses her gym bag on the bed.

She steps in front of her full-length mirror and inspects
her face. A thin adhesive strip rides her upper lip.

DELILAH
Oh yuck. I look like him.

MIRABELLE (0.S.)
What do you think you're doing?

Delilah turns. Mirabelle stands in the doorway, arms folded.

DELILAH
What're you talkin' about?

MIRABELLE
Oh my God! What is that?!

She hoofs it across the room, dodging SlamMan.

MIRABELLE
Is that a cut? Is it deep?

DELILAH
It's just a tiny one.

MIRABELLE
How did you get it?

DELILAH
I already told you.

MIRABELLE
You haven't told me anything. I
hardly see you anymore. Where've
you been going?

DELILAH
(mocking her)
You mean you don't remember?

Mirabelle searches the files in her head.

DELILAH
The other mornin'. You were havin'
breakfast. There was a lot of
laughter, as I recall.
40.

MIRABELLE
If you're telling me you've taken up
boxing, I'm gonna go ballistic.

DELILAH
Momma, you're already there.

Mirabelle pulls at her own hair, SCREAMS like a banshee.

DELILAH
I'm sorry if that upsets you. If
you need somethin' to hit, try the
SlamMan.

MIRABELLE
I want that monstrosity out of here!

She punches SlamMan in the head. Breaks a nail.

MIRABELLE
Good heavens. Now look what you've
done. This is all your fault!

DELILAH
My fault?!

MIRABELLE
You must have done something. Said
something stupid that upset him for
him to do that to you.

DELILAH
Did you just call me stupid?

Mirabelle inches backward.

DELILAH
Step back, Momma. Let me show you
how it's done.

She throws on her bag gloves, goes off on SlamMan. Mirabelle
looks on in horror. Races out clutching her hand.

INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM - RING -- DAY

Delilah spars with Slice, both in headgear. No sign of Tandy.
Delilah bounces around like she's at a disco. Slice toys
with her, arms down, smiles ugly through her mouthguard.

SLICE
That Band-Aid looks like a moustache.

DELILAH
Must stink to know I'm still prettier
than you.
41.
Slice STINGS her on the side of the head.

DELILAH
Maybe I oughta grow a full beard so
you can catch up.

Slice ZINGS her on the other side of the head.

SLICE
Keep talking, SilverSpoon. I'm kinda
enjoying this. Shouldn't you be in
a ball gown somewhere, cookin' up
some grits?

DELILAH
As a lady, I'm prone to wearin'
dresses. Where do rednecks normally
shop?

Slice laughs.

DELILAH
Did you get your three squares today?
I didn't notice any Slim Jim wrappers
in the trash.

As Delilah sweats, her skin strip begins to peel off.
DELILAH
Is that a new perfume you're wearin'?
I never tried Raid.
Slice swings, but this time, Delilah slips her punch.
SLICE
Such a sweet li'l thing, coming in
here to learn how to box. Should be
married 'n pregnant by now...
Tandy hustles into the gym carrying a grocery bag.
DELILAH
Aren't you married? Or don't you
have a brother?

Her skin strip falls. Slice unloads and CONNECTS on Delilah's
cut, dropping her flat on her back.

TANDY
Slice! You sloppy shit-bitch!

She drops her bag and hops into the ring.

TANDY
Get away from her!
42.
Slice edges out of the way. Blood pours from Delilah's lip.
DELILAH
(groggy)
I let you down.
Tandy uses the bottom of her shirt to press down on the cut.
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY -- DAY

Delilah sits on a gurney, a towel to her mouth, her eyes a
bit swollen. Tandy leans next to her as TRAFFIC passes by.

DELILAH
It's gonna be stitches for sure this
time.

TANDY

Don't worry. You'll still be the
prettiest one at the gym.

DELILAH
You really think so?
TANDY
I know so.
DELILAH

Why're we sittin' out here anyway?

TANDY
Because they ran out of room.

Nate turns the corner, sees Delilah.

NATE
I should've stayed in sales with all
these repeat customers.

DELILAH
The cut opened, Doctor More.

NATE
Uh oh. Another boxing accident?

DELILAH
Uh huh.

Nate smiles, he glances over at Tandy and all of a sudden
Tandy feels like she's intruding on a private conversation.

TANDY
I'll see ya back at the gym.
(goes, stops)
Wait. I'm your ride.
43.

DELILAH
That's okay. I'll just call a cab.
It's not that far.

TANDY
Okay. Bye.
(leaves)

DELILAH
(calling)
Thanks for drivin' me.

She lets go of her towel, Nate inspects her lip.

NATE
You're lucky, Miss Delilah. A little
Dermabond should do it. But that's
two strikes. Your eyes look swollen
to me, too.

He rips open a peroxide towelette and cleanses the cut.

DELILAH
Smells nice. Like lemons.

NATE
You know what goes good with that?

INT. HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA -- DAY

Delilah squeezes lemon into a cup of tea. A topical skin
adhesive highlights her upper lip.

NATE
(sips coffee)
So you're gonna beat the grits out
of your ex-fiancé?

DELILAH
"Deed I am.

NATE
Why?

DELILAH

He embarrassed me. And I'd like to
return the favor.

NATE
Would they even allow that?

DELILAH
They're gonna have to. Boxers must
be good for business, wouldn't you
say?
44.

NATE
I'd like not to think of it asa
growth industry.

Delilah notices his wedding band.

Silence.

DELILAH
Is your wife a doctor, too?

NATE
No, actually. She passed away.

DELILAH
Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
She must've been young.

NATE
Too young.

DELILAH
Do you have any kids?

NATE
One daughter. Abby.

DELILAH
Does she look like...?

NATE

Isabel. They have the exact same
eyes.

Both at a loss what to say next.

DELILAH

There's a um... Charity Ball goin'
on at the Convention Center on
Saturday night. If you think you
might be up for it, it'd sure be
nice to have a doctor in my corner.
You know, in case I get into any
fist fights.

NATE

I dunno. Saturday... I think I might
have something going on.

DELILAH
That makes one of us.

NATE
What's the charity?
45.

DELILAH

Southern Belles With Fat Lips...
Foundation.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT
Mirabelle stands with the fridge door open, glaring at Samuel.

MIRABELLE

I won't stand for this. It's bad
enough we spent thousands of dollars
on her wedding and have nothing to
show for it. But now she's got this
cockamamie idea in her head that's
gonna threaten her only asset which
is her looks. I won't stand for it.
You have to talk to her.

DINING ROOM
Charlene eavesdrops.

SAMUEL (0.S.)

Maybe it's just a phase she's gotta
work herself through.

BACK TO KITCHEN

MIRABELLE
We're not talking hula hoops and yo-
yos, Samuel. She's one facial scar
away from bagging groceries at the
Piggly Wiggly.
(slams fridge door)
Is that what you want?

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Samuel meanders in the dark toward Delilah's bedroom, her
light is on.

DELILAH'S BEDROOM

Samuel raises his hand to knock, peeks in.

Delilah hunches in a blue ball gown, whimpering in front of
her full-length mirror. Her back to Samuel, she wipes tears
from her eyes.

A sad look from Samuel and he sneaks away.
46.
INT. CONVENTION CENTER - LOBBY -- NIGHT
Elegant, refined. A HOST of tuxedos and ball gowns.

Delilah emerges through a revolving door looking impeccable,
aside from her TWO BLACK EYES.

Her appearance garners her an unfamiliar sort of attention,
which shows on her face when she spots two of her Bridesmaids
directing their BEAUS toward a more dignified place to mingle.

Smiling her way and dressed to the nines, is Nate. He holds
out his hand, she takes it.

NATE
You did say "boxing," didn't you?

DELILAH
(sigh of relief)
Yes, I did. I ran out o' concealer.

They stroll through the crowd of onlookers.
INT. CONVENTION CENTER - DINING HALL -- NIGHT

Delilah and Nate eat dinner at a table with six other GUESTS.
A few find it difficult not to stare at Delilah's bruises.

DELILAH
(sips wine)
So how old's Abby?

NATE
Thirteen. Eighth grade philosopher.

DELILAH
You have a picture?

Nate takes out his wallet, an accordion of pictures unravels.
Straight down into his soup.

NATE
Jeez! I'm an idiot.

DELILAH
Hurry, she's drownin'!
(hands him her napkin)

Nate wipes off the pictures, Delilah leans over to see.
DELILAH
My God, she is just beautiful. Even
with minestrone in her hair.

NATE
Yes, she is.
47.

DELILAH
What's she like?

NATE
She's a good egg. With a double
yolk, you might say.

DELILAH
Whaddya mean by that?

NATE
She's definitely got two sides to
her. There's the side I hear on the
phone a lot with her friends. And
then there's sort of a long-distance
Abby. That's the one that normally
shows up for dinner.

DELILAH
Has this been goin' on since...

Nate nods. They share a forlorn look.

Back to eating. Delilah raises her fork, looks up ata
TABLE ACROSS THE WAY

where Kelvin and Marney dine, laughing and smiling.
DELILAH'S EYES

glow fuchsia. She puts her fork down.

DELILAH

Would you excuse me for a minute?
NATE

Sure.
DELILAH

Thank you. I won't be long.
She gets up and glides across the dining hall to
KELVIN & MARNEY'S TABLE
They see her drawing near, and freeze with fear.

DELILAH
(addressing table)
How're all y'all doin' tonight?
Havin' a nice time?

The Guests turn, startled, as Delilah beams a smile at them
through her black eyes.
48.

DELILAH
Please forgive my appearance. I
don't mean to interrupt, I know all
y'all're enjoyin' your meal. Isn't
it just delicious?

Kelvin and Marney trade looks, unsure where the exits are.

DELILAH
Raise your hand if you got the sea
bass.

She looks around the table, a TIMID COUPLE raises their hands.

DELILAH
Itn't it scrumptious?

TIMID HUSBAND
Very scrumptious, thank you.

DELILAH
Goooood. All y'all've had a chance
to meet Mr. Wingfield here?

She gestures to Kelvin, the Guests nod.

DELILAH

Flyweight boxer. Handsome for his
size, don't you think? But I never
seen those Peter Jackson movies.
What you probably don't know - all
but one - is that he left me at the
altar. And my guess is, for the
woman seated to his left.

(Guests gasp and turn)
Itn't she sweet? Anyone know who
she is?

 

TIMID WIFE
Marney, right?

DELILAH

That's right. Marney Cobb. She was
my best friend.

(Guests gasp again)
"Deed, she was. But look at her
now. An up-n-comin' homewrecker.
Itn't that precious? Now all y'all
go on 'n enjoy your dessert. ‘Nite...

INT. CONVENTION CENTER - BALLROOM -- NIGHT
Delilah and Nate gaze at each other as they dance.

NATE
You're a natural.
49.

DELILAH
I should be. Started when I was
five.

NATE

How many years ago was that?

DELILAH
You're askin' a lady her age?

NATE
(Jimmy Stewart)
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

DELILAH

(giggles) _ . .
Thanks for comin' with me to this.

NATE
Don't mention it. I plan on giving
a fat check to the Fat Lip Foundation.

DELILAH
I'm sure they'd... swell with pride.
NATE
Naturally.
DELILAH
You ever been to somethin' like this
before?
NATE
Yes, I have. A little over two years
ago.
DELILAH

Feels sort o' surreal, doesn't it?
Funny. I was expectin' my next dance
to be with someone 'bout six inches
shorter than you.

NATE
I can slouch if you like.

DELILAH
No, don't do that. I don't want you
to do that.

Nate spins Delilah.
DELILAH
What do you do when the happier times
all start feelin' surreal?

NATE
I hold on.
50.

DELILAH
Until when?

NATE
Until the ride's over. And you have
to get off.

Delilah looks up at him.

DELILAH
It hurts when I smile. Maybe I should
stop.

NATE

Delilah, if you stop smiling, it'll
be the end of all of us.

DELILAH
I'll trade you. One painkiller for
every smile.

NATE
That sounds about right.

INT. ARENA - RING -- NIGHT
SUPER: FOUR MONTHS LATER
The sound of a fight BELL.

A leaner Delilah springs out of her corner. Her helmet is
color-coordinated with the rest of her outfit.

Her opponent, VALERIE VENDETTA, 30, snarly redhead, dances
over with confidence.

They trade jabs. Valerie throws a couple of straight rights
that Delilah parries.

Delilah tries a straight right, misses, loses her balance.
Valerie makes her pay for it with a wicked shot to the ribs.

TANDY
(slaps the mat)
Snap 'n back! Snap 'n back! Don't
leave yourself open!

Delilah bobs erratically east to west. Valerie connects
with a left uppercut.

Delilah delivers three left jabs, dropping her opponent back.

A left hook from Valerie that Delilah slips, she retaliates
with one of her own, surprising Valerie and her right temple.

Delilah loses her balance when she tries for a left uppercut,
but enough so to miss a vicious straight right from Valerie.

The BELL. Delilah retreats to her corner. Tandy, Hank and
Romeo enter the ring.
51.
IN THE CROWD
Samuel sits alone, his Panama hat pulled down low.
BACK TO RING

Hank rubs Vaseline under Delilah's left eye.

DELILAH
Is that non-comedogenic?

HANK
Sure. What?

Romeo gives her a swig of water.

TANDY
You're all over the place out there.
Did Slice stick a curling iron down
your shorts?

DELILAH
Yes, she did. I'm still gettin'
warmed up.
(smiles up at Romeo)

Romeo laughs, until he sees Tandy's look.

TANDY
This girl's just waitin' for ya to
lose your balance so she can knock
the shit outta ya. Make the bitch
wait.

HANK
You can do it, Delilah.

DELILAH
Thanks, Hank.

The BELL. Delilah comes out of her corner, bobbing less.

Valerie starts in with two right uppercuts to Delilah's ribs.
Not ready for them, she stiffens up.

Delilah comes back with a jab and a straight right, Valerie
parries them both. She counters with a combination of her
own, landing both.

Delilah's back to moving helter-skelter. Conscious of her
left ribs, she lowers her guard. Valerie lets loose a
straight right that drops Delilah flat.

TANDY
Shit!
52.
REFEREE starts the countdown. Delilah doesn't budge an inch.
IN THE CROWD
An ashen Samuel stands up.
ACROSS THE WAY
Nate looks sick to his stomach.
BACK TO RING
Delilah's counted out. Tandy, Hank and Romeo scramble in.

TANDY
Delilah!

The RING PHYSICIAN, 50s, enters, stoops down to Delilah.

RING PHYSICIAN
Can you hear me?

He checks her airways, tilts her head back.

TANDY
COME ON...

RING PHYSICIAN
Can you hear me, Miss MacIntosh?

DELILAH
I do. I do. I dooo...

Her eyes slowly open, she looks up at the Ring Physician.
DELILAH
(wistfully)
That's all he needed to say.
Ring Physician and Tandy look at each other quizzically.
INT. ARENA - DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT
Dimly lit, a few lights have been punched out. Delilah sits
on a bench, showered and dressed, morose and lost in her
thoughts. A welt surrounds her left eye.

Tandy appears in the shadows, Delilah doesn't need to look.

DELILAH
Sometimes I just don't know who I'm
foolin'.
(beat)

Am I foolin' you?

TANDY
"Bout what?
53.

DELILAH
Me. As a boxer.

TANDY
If boxing was easy, God wouldn't
have invented championship belts.

DELILAH
Can I ask you somethin'?
TANDY
Okay.
DELILAH
Do you think... I have what it takes?
TANDY
No.

Delilah turns to face her.

TANDY
When ya do, ya won't have to ask.

INT. NATE'S HOME - KITCHEN -- NIGHT
Nate sets a big bowl of spaghetti on the table. His daughter

ABBY, 13, anxious eyes and nondescript clothes, adds
Silverware and napkins. Nate turns off the TV.

ABBY
I hope you didn't put too much oregano
this time.

NATE

There's no such thing as too much
oregano. Just add more basil.

ABBY
(snags a breadstick)
If you say so.

NATE
Doing anything this Saturday?
ABBY
I dunno, why?
NATE
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
ABBY
Who?
NATE

Her name's Delilah.
54.

ABBY
Do I know her?

NATE
If you did, I wouldn't ask you to
meet her.

Abby looks away. Round One goes to Nate.

Round Two

ABBY
Where's she from?
NATE
Savannah.
ABBY
No, I mean how'd you -- never mind.
NATE

She came into the emergency room one
day with a busted lip.

ABBY
Someone beat ‘er up?

NATE
Sort of.

ABBY
Sort of?

NATE

She's a boxer.

ABBY
Huh. That's sorta dangerous.

to Abby. She whips out her cell phone.

NATE
Do you have to do that now?

ABBY
(punching buttons)
What're you doing with her?

NATE
Whaddya mean, what am I doing with
her?

ABBY
You know.

NATE

No I don't.
55.

ABBY
Dad, you're a doctor. And today we
were putting condoms on plantains in
sex ed class. You do know.

NATE
So now you're gonna hold my degree
against me? I screwed up the sauce.
At least let me keep my degree.
Abby smirks at her dad.

NATE
Plantains?

Split decision.
INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

Delilah, in neon green, practices slips by dodging the
weighted end of a swinging rope. Romeo jumps rope nearby.

ROMEO
Did you catch Project Runway last
night?

DELILAH

Never miss it.

ROMEO
Man, that guy Vernon's crazy. He
had his nose so far up that judge's
ass, if she sneezed he would've died.

DELILAH
Oh I don't like him. I like Alysha.
Ev'ry week she makes somethin'
different.

HANK (0.S.)
I like Inga.

Delilah turns toward Hank and gets clonked in the head.

DELILAH
Ow!

Romeo swings his rope around to Hank, who does situps.
HANK
She always knows how far to push it
before the judges get pissed off.
Tandy shows, holding a boom box.

TANDY
Ya done bonkin' yourself in the head?
56.

DELILAH
For today, yes.

TANDY
Good. Come with me.

She leads Delilah to the
RING
and sets the boom box down.

TANDY
We need to find you a rhythm. Long
one's too mellow for ya, and the
short one almost gotcha killed. Ya
said you've been taking dancing
lessons since you were born?

DELILAH
Give or take a few years.

TANDY
You remember the box step?

DELILAH
It's been a while.

Tandy turns on WALTZING music.
TANDY

Dance with me. You wanna be the man
or the woman?

DELILAH
Which would you rather be?
TANDY
I asked you first.
DELILAH
Well then I guess that makes you the

man.

They assume a Closed Position, Tandy as the man. She brings
her left foot forward, Delilah brings her right foot back.
The box step is underway.

TANDY
Is it coming back to ya?

DELILAH
Pretty much. 'Cept I don't hear my
Momma screamin' in the background.
57.

TANDY
Good. Ya don't want your opponent
to get a read on ya. If they predict
where you're going before ya even
get there, you're as done as dinner.

DELILAH
We don't want that.

TANDY
If ya think they are getting a read
on ya, I want ya to switch genders.

DELILAH
That'd be awful expensive, don't you
think?

TANDY

No. I mean, dance the man's part.

DELILAH
Oh. Okay.

Tandy shakes her head, a flicker of a smile as they waltz.
Meanwhile, the Gym-goers have congregated outside the ring.

A flustered-looking Slice emerges from the locker room.
SLICE
What in Holy Hell's she done to this
place?
EXT. PARK - FOUNTAIN -- DAY
Delilah, in electric red, jumps rope.

A COUPLE bickers nearby. They appear lost. The Wife
approaches Delilah, the Husband lags behind eyeing a map.

LOST WIFE
Excuse me, Miss. We're not from
around here. Can you tell us how to
get to Benny's Cafe?

DELILAH

I sure can. Where you visitin' from?
LOST WIFE

Minnesota.
DELILAH

Well, welcome to Savannah! Glad to
have you.
58.

LOST WIFE
Thank you. Very much. We're so
glad to -- Harold, put that map away
for God's sake! Can't you see this
nice woman is trying to help us?

He puts it away, smiles condescendingly at Delilah.

DELILAH
Benny's is sooo good. You have got
to try their oysters. They are ab-
so-lute-ly out o' this world.

LOST HUSBAND
We would ab-so-lute-ly like to try
them. Sooner rather than later.

DELILAH
Well, that's easy. You head straight
down River Street, take a sharp left
on Bay by Cromwell Theatre. That's
where they had that awful fire twelve
years back. Oh, and it was such a
shame, too, cuz at that time it was
the oldest theatre in all o' Georgia.
They redid it nice 'n pretty, but
it's just not the same. When you
reach the end o' Bay, you wanna turn
left onto Matlin and a quick right
onto Acorn. You'll see Ernesto's
Cafe on the corner. It used to be
Henry's Diner, but when Henry's wife
caught 'im cheatin' with the hostess,
poor man lost everythin'. Benny's
is just two more blocks from there.
Straight shot, you can't miss it.

The Wife seems more ready to have an aneurysm than an oyster.

LOST WIFE
Thank you.

The Couple turns and leaves.
LOST HUSBAND
(takes out the map)
Told you.
Delilah practices her box step, jabbing as she goes.
Nate and Abby turn up. Dad's smiling, daughter's frowning.

NATE
Hey, Punchy.
59.

DELILAH
There you are. Thought you might've
skipped town.

NATE
Abby, this is Delilah. Delilah,
Abby.

DELILAH

So nice to finally meet you.

Abby forces a smile.

DELILAH
My, you're even prettier in person.
NATE
And this is from a beauty pageant
winner.
ABBY
So... why are you boxing?
DELILAH

Why not? Girl doesn't have to be
one thing, does she?

ABBY
Yeah, but, boxing can ruin your looks.

DELILAH
Uh huh. Just like stress, 'n second-
hand smoke, 'n my favorite, Father
Time. Besides, it's fun. Look!

She jabs with her left, a right cross, a left uppercut.

DELILAH
Works the kinks out. C'mon, let me
show you.

Abby rolls her eyes, mopes over to Delilah.

DELILAH
(demonstrates)
Line up your right heel and your
left toe. Flex your knees, bend
your hips a little, tuck your elbows
in, and put up your dukes.

Abby caves, she assumes the boxer's stance.

DELILAH
Now jab.

Abby jabs with her left.
60.
DELILAH
(joins in)
Good. Now try your right.

Nate grins as they punch away in harmony.

NATE
I've really done it now.

DELILAH
Snap it right out. Good. This is
the punch you'll use in case you're
ever in a street fight. Or if you
just wanna beat up the class clown.

ABBY
What about bullies?

DELILAH
Them, too.

Nate gazes at Abby. She steals a look back at him.

They stop

NATE
Abby, is there something you wanna
tell me?

ABBY

No. It's not a big deal.

NATE
What's not a big deal?

jabbing. Abby sulks.
ABBY

It's just this jerk in my math class.
Tommy Willis.

NATE
What about Tommy Willis?
ABBY
He's been... snapping my bra. I
can't get him to stop.
NATE
How long has this been going on?
ABBY
A month.
NATE

A month? Why didn't you tell me?
61.

ABBY
We all have to fight our own battles.
Isn't that what you said?

NATE
This is different.
ABBY
Why?
NATE
Because you're my daughter. That's
why.
DELILAH
Might I offer a suggestion?
NATE
What?
DELILAH
The combination punch!
NATE
Delilah, please... let's be realistic.
DELILAH
Hear me out. Is this boy bigger
than you?
ABBY

Yeah, he's pretty big. And fat.

DELILAH
Don't you worry 'bout that. That's
just hormones 'n poor eatin' habits.
Come with me.

She leads them to a
GRASSY AREA

NATE
Delilah, what are we doing?

DELILAH
What are we doin'? We're puttin'
arrows in your daughter's quiver.
That's what we're doin'. Three to
be exact. And you're gonna be the
honorary guinea pig. Is that okay
with you, Abby?

ABBY
Uh huh.

Delilah sets Nate in front of her.
62.

DELILAH
Now. Make like you're Tommy Willis.

NATE
What do you expect me to do?

DELILAH
Improvise.

Nate puffs out his cheeks like he's a hundred pounds
overweight. He raises his arms up like a monster, aims for
Delilah's bra. Abby giggles.

DELILAH
Now just watch me, Abby.
(demonstrates in slow-
motion)
Left jab. Then a straight right.
Then finish 'im off with a left hook.

ABBY
Got it.
(pulls out a tiny
notepad and pen)
Left, right, left.

DELILAH
Right. I'm gonna do it a little
faster this time, okay?

ABBY
Okay.

Delilah delivers the combination on Nate. She pulls the
punches a bit, but truth is, she didn't like the comment
about being realistic. Nate falls heavily on his keester.

Delilah hovers over Nate menacingly. A WOMAN in a pink
sweater approaches.

PINK SWEATER
Miss MacIntosh?

DELILAH
Yes.

PINK SWEATER
I knew it was you. I'm Sheila
Reynolds. I work over at Channel 3.
How would you feel about coming on
Good Mornin', Savannah tomorrow?

DELILAH
(duh)
You're askin' me if I wanna be on
TV?
63.
INT. CHANNEL THREE STUDIOS - MORNING TALK SHOW -- DAY

The STUDIO AUDIENCE whips up a frenzy. Talk show host KIP,
40s, salt-and-pepper hair with a scary-white smile, sits
alongside MINDY, 28, perky brunette with dimples.

KIP
And we're back. Hello again,
everyone, and welcome to Good Mornin',
Savannah. Our next guest has taken
makeovers to an absolute extreme.
She's won two beauty pageants right
here in our beloved state of Georgia,
including this year's Magnolia
Princess. And then what does she go
and do? She puts on boxing gloves.
I mean, can you believe it? Whaddya
say, should we bring her out here?

STUDIO AUDIENCE
YES!

KIP
Well alright, then. Everyone, please
welcome to our show, the Beauty Queen
turned Boxer... Delilah MacIntosh!

The Studio Audience goes NUTS. Delilah waves as she strides
across the stage, she kisses Kip and Mindy on the cheek.

DELILAH
G' Mornin'!

KIP
And Good Morning to you, Delilah.
May I call you Delilah?

DELILAH
Well that's my name, isn't it?

KIP
(obnoxious laugh)
Yes, it sure is. So tell us, Delilah,
what on earth happened? Why trunks
instead of an evening gown?

DELILAH
You mean you didn't hear?

KIP
Hear what?

DELILAH
Raise your hand if you heard about
me.

Nearly everyone raises their hand, including Mindy.
The crowd

64.

KIP
(gesturing to Mindy)
Even she heard. What didn't I hear?

DELILAH
I was stood up at the altar.
Boos.
DELILAH
Uh huh. I agree.
KIP
(more comical than
angry)
Why don't you tell me these things?!
MINDY

I thought I'd leave it up to her to
bring it up. I didn't want to say
anything to embarrass her.

DELILAH
Thank you for that. You're so sweet.

KIP
So now it's all beginning to make
sense. Wait a sec. No it isn't.
Some jerk jilts you, and you put on
boxing gloves? I don't get it. How
long ago was this?

DELILAH
Comin' up on five months. Did I
mention my ex- is a boxer?

KIP
No, but... Hold it. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

DELILAH
Uh huh. I'm gonna box his ass blue.

INT. KELVIN'S BEDROOM -- DAY

ON TELEVISION

Delilah on Good Mornin', Savannah.

KIP
Oh my God! You can't be serious.
Is she serious, folks?

DELILAH
Go on, tell ‘im.

STUDIO AUDIENCE
YES!
65.

KIP
Well, I'll be... you heard it here
first. But what about bygones bein'
bygones? Don't you believe in that?

DELILAH
Oh please. I was jilted in front o'
all my friends, my family, everyone.
No self-respectin' belle's gonna
stand for such nonsense.
(directly into camera)
Itn't that right, Kelvin?

BED

Kelvin sits up watching TV with Marney.

KELVIN
She's flipped her fritters.
MARNEY
Poor thing.
BACK TO TELEVISION
KIP

So, Delilah, you've obviously turned
things around for yourself. Is there
someone new in your life?

DELILAH
There sure is. His name's Nate.
And he's a doctor.

The crowd cheers.
KIP
Wow, look at you. So many changes
in such a short period of time...
DELILAH
And he is the sweetest man I have
ever met. So kind, and considerate.
The type I used to think belonged
only in fairy tales...
INT. TANDY'S KITCHEN -- DAY

Tandy sits at the table watching Good Mornin', Savannah.
She appears lost and disappointed. Her breakfast, untouched.

INT. ARENA - RING -- NIGHT

A sold-out CROWD looks on as Delilah battles GLADYS THE
GRAVEDIGGER, 36, spiky blonde hair, the bizarro Delilah.

Delilah throws three lightning lefts- each of them, strikes.
66.

Gladys returns fire with a straight right that clears
Delilah's sinuses. She adjusts her headgear.

A one-two combination from Delilah throttles Gladys, but
she's late returning to guard and pays for it in spades.

Delilah's rhythm turns haphazard again. Gladys sees that
she's off balance and capitalizes with a mean left hook.

The BELL. Hank sets down a stool and goes to work applying
Vaseline, Romeo waters down Delilah.

HANK
You're doin' good, you're doin' good.

ROMEO
Kick her ass, Delilah. This one's
got no sense of style whatsoever.

Tandy takes her sweet time entering the ring.

DELILAH
I did better the first two rounds,
didn't 1?

TANDY

What are you asking me for? Don't
you know when you're getting your
ass kicked? Or do I need to draw
you a map?

DELILAH
What am I doin' wrong?

TANDY
If you wanna forget everything we
talked about, that's your business.
I'm not your boss, and you're not my
secretary.

The BELL.

DELILAH
What's with you?

Coming full speed ahead is Gladys. Right cross. POw!

Delilah falls back against the turnbuckle. She bobs and
weaves like mad, trying to evade the flurry of punches.

Then, Delilah GROWLS at Gladys. Her opponent steps back.
Delilah struts out of her corner like a cat on the prowl.

Gladys swings and misses. Another one, misses. Delilah's
full-on into her box step, throwing rapid jabs as she goes.
67.

When Gladys tries for a right hook, Delilah sidesteps. When
she lunges forward, Delilah drops back out of harm's way.

Just when Gladys thinks she's got a read on her, Delilah
switches genders on her box step. Not only does Gladys miss,
but she leaves herself wide open. Delilah CONNECTS with a
left hook that sends her opponent spiraling down to the mat.

DELILAH
Oh my God.

Outside the ring, Romeo jumps up and down, high-fives Hank.

As the REFEREE counts, Gladys slowly rises to her feet.
Delilah beams with confidence, swaggers as she throws
everything but the kitchen sink at her opponent. Gladys
tries to shield herself from the barrage. The BELL.

Hank and Romeo storm the ring.

HANK
I knew you could do it!

ROMEO
(hugs Delilah)
She looked just like you. Except
older, fatter, and on crack.

DELILAH
(laughs)
Thanks.

She gets caught up in the moment.

IN THE CROWD

Samuel, in his Panama hat, stands and applauds his daughter.
BACK TO RING

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
decision. Judge Duane Savage scores
the fight forty to thirty-five.
Judge Matt Anderson scores the bout
forty to thirty-six. Judge Fred
Karnicky scores the fight forty to
thirty-four. And the winner by
unanimous decision -- Delilah
MacIntosh!

DELILAH
I did it. I DID IT!

Hank and Romeo hoist Delilah up. She smiles ear-to-ear.
68.
HANK AND ROMEO
(chanting)
DELILAH...

It finally dawns on Delilah that Tandy's not in the ring.
She scans the arena. Her smile wilts when she spots Tandy
heading down the aisle toward the showers.
INT. ARENA - DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT
Tandy washes her face in the sink. Gym bag at her feet.

Delilah appears looking hot, sweaty and bothered. Tandy
ignores her, fixes her hair in the mirror.

 

DELILAH
Where were you?
TANDY
When?
DELILAH
Whaddya mean, when? When I won my
first fight in like -- forever.

Is there somethin' you're not tellin'
me?

TANDY
Oh now that's rich.

DELILAH
What's rich?

TANDY
You asking me if there's something
I'm not telling you.

DELILAH
Look, I'm too hot 'n smelly to play
hide 'n seek. Just tell me what's
wrong.

TANDY
All that baloney about beauty pageants
and changing career paths. Magnolia
Princess... you really had me going.

Delilah ambles over to her sister. Gently, she pries the
box of cookies from her hand.

DELILAH
How do you expect to find her if you
keep on buryin' her?

Charlene looks at the box of cookies, then up at Delilah.
It's a look they haven't shared since they were children
running around in the backyard.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - KITCHEN -- DAY

Mirabelle pours a cup of coffee for a WOMAN seated at the
table: 40s, white pantsuit, and a pretentious scarf.

PRETENTIOUS
Thank you. Smells delightful.

MIRABELLE
So is this something that would pay
per assignment, or would she receive
an annual salary?

PRETENTIOUS
It's per assignment. But, trust me,
it's quite lucrative, just the same.
I suppose if I talk to some people --

MIRABELLE
I think she might be coming.
(nonchalantly)
I am so glad I tried this brand of
coffee. Isn't it heavenly?

Delilah saunters in, ignoring the people seated at the table.
She rests the box of cookies on the counter.

MIRABELLE
Oh, Delilah. There's someone I'd
like you to meet. This is Ms.
Williamson. She works for Ciao Belle
magazine.

Pretentious stands and extends her hand with a flawless smile.
She towers over Delilah.

PRETENTIOUS
It's so nice to meet you.

Delilah shakes her hand, more than a little suspicious.
PRETENTIOUS

Please, won't you join us?
(takes a seat)
71.

DELILAH
I prefer to stand, thank you. What's
this about?

MIRABELLE
How does a dream come true sound?

DELILAH
Like it's dark out and I'm asleep.

MIRABELLE
Oh you wouldn't want to sleep through
this, Honey. Please, fill my daughter
in on all the details.

PRETENTIOUS
Delilah, our magazine is currently
in need of a new fashion model. One
that fits your specs to a tee. I
can tell immediately that --

DELILAH

My mother put you up to this?
PRETENTIOUS

Well, um... I'm the newest member of

her bridge club and --

MIRABELLE
How does one hundred thousand a year
sound for having your picture taken?

DELILAH
What's the catch?

MIRABELLE
Oh now that's the best part. You
won't have to box anymore. Isn't
that right, Kaleena?

Delilah reaches for the box of cookies, stuffs her face.

PRETENTIOUS
That's true. We strongly encourage
our models to participate in rigorous
physical activity, but with minimal
risk. Stationary bikes, rowing
machines, treadmills...

Her cheeks puffy, Delilah looks a little like Dizzy Gillespie.

MIRABELLE
What in God's name are you doing?

Delilah TALKS but every word is indiscernible.
72.

MIRABELLE
I didn't raise you to be this
disrespectful.

Delilah tries for a REPLY, but again it's incomprehensible.

MIRABELLE
Go on, leave. Now! Go box yourself
into a corner, why don't you?

Delilah delivers an elaborate curtsy and departs with a beauty
queen wave.

INT. NATE'S HOME - KITCHEN -- DAY

Nate mixes a protein drink in a blender. Delilah sits at
the table, gazing blankly out the window.

NATE
Maybe she'll come around.

DELILAH
I dunno. She seemed pretty hurt.

NATE
At least now we won't have to meet
in the ER. That's a relief.

DELILAH
I guess.

Her brooding comes to an abrupt halt.

DELILAH
Wait. Are you sayin' you feel
relieved about all this?

NATE
Maybe a little.

Delilah cocks her head back like: "I didn't just hear that."

NATE
Okay more than a little.

DELILAH
How could you say a thing like that?
I've invested my whole life in this.

NATE
You think it's easy for me, watching
people take swings at you?

DELILAH
No, but, this is my future we're
talkin' about.
73.

NATE
If being concerned about you makes
me selfish then I'm plumb out of
ideas. I'm not in a real hurry to
lose someone I care about.

A moment of silence. Nate pours the protein drink. On the
countertop, he glimpses the Sports section. Headline:
"Delilah Buries the Gravedigger!"

Nate sets

I'm just not sure it was all because

NATE
What do you mean?

DELILAH
She said: I hope you guys are real
happy together. Lord knows she
couldn't've have meant him.

NATE
Maybe she meant us.

DELILAH
I s'pose.

NATE

Do you think she might be --

DELILAH
I dunno... I don't think so. We
waltzed once but we were just
practicin' my footwork.

NATE
Maybe you were.

DELILAH
Is it gettin' hot in here or is it
just me?

NATE
No, it's getting hot. Very hot.
Smokin' hot, as a matter of fact.
C'mon.

Delilah follows him out.

LIVING ROOM

Nate collapses on the sofa. Delilah curls up in a ball.
74.

DELILAH
How's Abby doin'?
NATE
Better, actually. She's not
disappearing as fast after dinner.
DELILAH
That's a start. She upstairs

NATE
Nope. She's got piano, Tuesdays.

DELILAH
Interestin'.

NATE
Wanna know something?

DELILAH
What's that?

NATE
I didn't even know she was wearing a
bra.

DELILAH
Well maybe she is. But I'm not.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Delilah slugs away on SlamMan, sweat flicking off of her.
Mirabelle appears in the doorway, carrying a photo album.

MIRABELLE
Can I show you something?

Delilah stops abruptly, in no mood for Momma's bullshit.

DELILAH
What?

MIRABELLE
I came across it this morning.
Thought you might wanna have a look.
She sidles up to Delilah, and opens the
PHOTO ALBUM
Pictures from all of Delilah's beauty pageants.
MIRABELLE

Do you remember? We took you to so
many...
75.

DELILAH
How come I haven't seen a lot of
these?

MIRABELLE

They're for special occasions. Just
like this. So many years, so much
energy and hard work, you devoted.
I just want to say... how proud I am
of you.

(off Delilah's

perplexed look)
I mean it. How many people do we
know come up with one goal today,
just to forget about it tomorrow?
That's why New Year's resolutions
are such a joke. And that's why...
it pains me to see you slide.

DELILAH
Who's slidin'? I'm not slidin'.

MIRABELLE

I never stopped to consider just how
traumatic an experience it must've
been for you. To be left standing
there. That's my fault. I should've
known better. It's understandable
you'd want an escape route of some
kind. And you chose boxing.

DELILAH
Momma. It's not just an escape route.

MIRABELLE
Honey, who could blame you for wanting
to beat the bejesus out of that boy?
I couldn't. It's just awful what he
did. But do you really want to throw
away everything you worked for?

DELILAH
This isn't even about me, is it.

MIRABELLE
What? Of course it is.

DELILAH
No it isn't. It's about you. And
how you're always lookin' for a return
on your investment. Well sometimes
it just doesn't happen, Momma!

DELILAH
And to see you come in here holdin'

well that's just tacky, Momma.

MIRABELLE
(red alert)
Don't you ever use that word on me.

DELILAH
I just did! Tacky, tacky, tacky.
Want a Tic Tac, Momma?

MIRABELLE
You know what the real shame is in
all this?

DELILAH

I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

DELILAH
That's exactly how you operate, isn't

veiled threats. Before you know it,

Keep your money. I hope it keeps
you warm at night.

She glides past her mother and out of the room.

INT. ARENA - DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

Kelvin throws on a leather jacket over his gaudy shirt and
tie. Milling about are Best Man, Buck, Chuck and Tuck.

BEST MAN
You kicked that bitch's ass tonight.

KELVIN
That's what I do.

He adjusts his tie and spits on the floor.

KELVIN
Let's blow this Popsicle stand.

He leads the way out down a
LONG HALLWAY

BUCK
What's next for the K-man?

KELVIN
(pumps his fist as he
farts)
That's what's next. I say we grab
ourselves some high-quality snapper.

CHUCK
I had fish two nights ago.

TUCK
He means pussy, you dumbass.

KELVIN
Chucky, haven't you gotten laid yet?

BEST MAN
Hey, maybe we should start a charity.

BUCK
The Fuck Chuck Fund. Whaddya think?

BEST MAN
More like the Upchuck Fund.

TUCK
For as little as fifty-two cents a
day, you can send Poor Chucky here
to a prostitute.

The entourage laughs its way through the exit doors.
78.
EXT. ARENA -- NIGHT

Kelvin and the gang are greeted by some flash bulbs. A
REPORTER, 30s with super thick hair, approaches with a mike.

REPORTER
Mr. Wingfield, I wonder if I might
have a word with you.

KELVIN
Stop wondering and ask away.

REPORTER
Obviously, another victory tonight.
Superb performance. But the question
that's really on people's minds
involves your ex-fiancée, Delilah
MacIntosh. On Good Mornin', Savannah
the other day --

KELVIN

(raises his hand like

a stop sign)
I'm aware of the interview. There
won't be any fight. So let me stop
you right there. I have too much
respect for women to start throwing
punches at them, I thank you very

much.

REPORTER
So there's no chance of that
happening.

KELVIN

You catch on quick.

REPORTER
You go by the name Sir Kelvin. Now,
were you actually knighted by the
Queen?

KELVIN
Is that actually your hair?

REPORTER
Toupee.
(flinches)
Touché. With all due respect, Mr.
Wingfield, it sounds like your ex-
means business. Are you aware that
she upset Gladys the Gravedigger?
79.

KELVIN
No, I wasn't aware. But I can't say
it surprises me either.

INT. MALL - RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

A suspended television is tuned into Kelvin's interview.
ON SCREEN

Kelvin and the Reporter walk and talk.

REPORTER

So you feel that your ex-fiancée
does have enough talent to --

KELVIN

No, I mean it doesn't surprise me
that the judges would squeeze her
through.

REPORTER
But the decision was unanimous.

KELVIN
Look. She's real friendly with
people. And she likes to have a
good time. I guess it pays to make
yourself available that way.

REPORTER
Just a sec. Are you suggesting there
was some impropriety on the part of
Miss MacIntosh?

KELVIN
We're just talking. But let me ask
you this... have you ever known a
pretty woman to not use looks to her
advantage?
RESTAURANT

Delilah watches the TV, her eyes crimson with rage. She
does an about-face and stomps out of the restaurant.

INT. MALL - FORMAL WEAR SHOP -- NIGHT

Delilah barges in, surprising a small SALESCLERK, 50s, with
a distinctive white moustache. He drops a box of hangers.

SALESCLERK
(composes himself)
May I help you, madam?
80.
DELILAH
Yes, I need a tuxedo. Size thirty-
eight short. Verrrrry SHORT.
Salesclerk looks scared. He positions himself behind a rack.
INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Delilah stands in the center of her room, drawing on
something. She steps back a few paces to get a better look.

SLAMMAN

Now decked out in a tuxedo and a white bow tie. A pencil
moustache, drawn in permanent marker, lines his upper lip.

Delilah eyes SlamMan with perfect fury. Slowly, she slides
on her bag gloves.

DELILAH
This is gonna hurt you a lot more
than it's gonna hurt me.
She unleashes hell.
INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY

Delilah slinks in wearing shades. As she pulls them off,
she spots Tandy. They exchange injured looks.

INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM - LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

Delilah marches over to the

SINKS

and sets her gym bag on the counter. She pulls out a brush.

As Delilah brushes her hair, she spots Slice two sinks over,
applying makeup. She wears a pale purple blouse.

Slice scowls at Delilah through the reflection.

DELILAH
Must be hard.

SLICE
What?

DELILAH

Hatin' someone you don't even know.

SLICE
You mean you?
81.

DELILAH
Uh huh.

SLICE
I know enough.

DELILAH
Where're you goin' all fancied up?

SLICE
What's it to you?

DELILAH
Just makin' conversation. If you'd
rather stand here and grimace at
each other, I guess that's fine.
(wraps her ponytail)
Got a lunch date?

Slice looks at Delilah askew.

She folds

SLICE
Hank's taking me to that Thai
restaurant that opened up.

DELILAH
Oh the one on Hanover? I been meanin'
to try that one. By the way, that
blush is all wrong for you.
(zips up her gym bag)

SLICE
No it ain't.

DELILAH
Course it is.

her arms like a professor eager to pontificate.

DELILAH
Makeup one-oh-one. You're either
cool, cool, cool or warm, warm, warm.

SLICE
What?

DELILAH
You've got auburn hair. Nice auburn
hair, as a matter of fact. That was
a compliment, don't let it fluster
you. Your colorin' is both warm and
intense. So guess what? You want
your makeup and clothes to match.
Warm, warm, warm.

(MORE )
82.

DELILAH
That blush is too light for you.
Makes you look harsh. And you don't
need any help with that. Let me
see, I might just have somethin’...

She unzips her gym bag and dumps a cornucopia of makeup onto
the counter.

DELILAH
(sifting through it)
That one's too light. No, not that
one. HERE. This'll work. Autumn.
It won't wash you out. Now go on
and rinse that stuff off your face.

Slice hesitates.

DELILAH
Go on, now. You don't wanna go ona
date lookin' like Casper the Friendly
Ghost, do ya?

Slice washes her face.

DELILAH
Here's a towel.
(tosses one from her
bag)
Nothin' I like more than a clean
slate. Now, is that the only shirt
you got?

SLICE
I usually wear one at a time.

DELILAH
I'll see what I got in the car.

She skedaddles. Slice watches her leave. She looks over
the abundance of makeup, glimpses herself in the mirror.
She's just not accustomed to this level of attention.

INT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
Abby walks with her friend, MELISSA. Both carry backpacks.

MELISSA
I can't believe Mr. Hogan is having
us do a paper on snails. I mean,
what do you say... they're slow, and
slimy, and French people eat them.
Case closed.
83.
ABBY
At least we don't have to dissect
them. That would really suck.
EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY
They exit the building.
MELISSA
Call me if you're not doing anything
later. I'll come over and show you
those boots I got.

ABBY
Later.

She veers course, cutting across the playground.

The sound of RUNNING footsteps behind her, culminating with
the SNAP of Abby's bra.

ABBY
Cut the shit, you asshole!

TOMMY WILLIS has got about a hundred pounds on Abby, with
rosy cheeks. His THREE BUDDIES are skinny and pale.

TOMMY
(mocking)
Cut the shit, you asshole.
The Buddies laugh hysterically.

TOMMY
Why don't you make me?

Abby thinks about it. She removes the backpack from her
shoulder and drops it casually to the ground.

ABBY
Okay.

She raises her sleeves and puts up her dukes.

Tommy looks at his Buddies befuddled: you really think I
should fight this girl?

He turns to face Abby, raises his fists.

BUDDIES
(chanting)
TOMMY...

Tommy bends his head forward, pumps his fists. He peeks at
Abby through his eyebrows. An evil grin spreads out over
his face.
84.

They move in a circle. Tommy throws a few weak punches,
thinking it will intimidate Abby. It doesn't.

He decides to go for the stomach. Mistake. Abby catches
Tommy with an UPPERCUT that brings him to an upright position.
This sets her up nicely for a ONE-TWO that drops him on his
ass. The Buddies double over laughing.

BUDDIES
(chanting)
ABBY...

ABBY
Come on. Get up, Bubbalicious.

Tommy is more staggered than he'd like to admit. He can't
quite make it to his feet.

A final crowd-pleaser: Abby reaches into her shirt and undoes
her bra. The Buddies jump about like they're auditioning
for Springer.

Abby approaches Tommy from behind and manages to clasp the
bra around his enormous torso.

ABBY
You're gonna need a bigger cup size.

INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- NIGHT

Delilah, alone in the corner, affixes iron plates toa
barbell. By the looks of her, she's been at it all day.

She lies down to bench press. Manages to lift the bar up.
Squeezes out three reps.

She goes for a fourth, brings the weight down to her chest.
But that's it. She's on empty. Delilah struggles but she
can't get the bar off her chest. Deep breath, one more try.

DELILAH
Motherfuckin' horseshit cocksucker
fuckin' piece of shit asshole
motherfuckin' shitstain bitch!

The Gym-goers are not accustomed to hearing this language
from Delilah. They look on in sheer horror as she adds
complexity to her litany of profanity.
Tandy emerges from her office.
TANDY
(to Gym-goers)
Are you fuckin' BLIND?

She races over and snags the barbell, sets it on the rack.
Delilah's

85.

TANDY
Trying to kill yourself, Goldilocks?

too spent to reply. She sits up, gasping for air.
TANDY

Should I look outside and see if the
moon's blood red?

DELILAH
Huh?
TANDY
I never heard you swear like that.
DELILAH
I save it. Special occasions only.
TANDY
I see. How's the hunt for a trainer
going?
DELILAH

It's goin'. No, that's a lie. Tell
you the truth, I haven't been lookin'.

TANDY
Why not?

DELILAH
I wouldn't wanna put anyone else
through the trouble.

TANDY
Whaddya mean?

DELILAH
There's only so many people you can
let down 'fore you start feelin'
ashamed o' yourself.
(lies down on bench)
A lot easier this way.

TANDY
Why didn't you tell me about wanting
to fight Kelvin?

DELILAH
I heard what you said to Slice. The
day I walked in here. I figured...
(fighting herself)
It's still no excuse for lyin'.
86.

TANDY
What makes you think he would fight
you? After all this, he could just
say no.

DELILAH
I s'pose he could. Already done it
once. Guess I didn't think that far
ahead.

TANDY
Or worse, what if he did fight you
and kicked your teeth in? Say Goodbye
to Magnolia Princess. And how's that
for embarrassing? Getting beat up
by the guy who left you at the altar.

DELILAH
Never said it was gonna be easy.
But that's how I know it's right.

TANDY
You feel like getting outta here for
a while?
EXT. RIVER -- DAY
Delilah and Tandy in a rowboat. Delilah does all the work.
DELILAH

This was a great idea. Nice to be
out for a change.

TANDY
(fixes her hair)
So how does your boyfriend -- Nathan,
is it?
DELILAH
Nate.
TANDY
How does he feel about you boxing
Kelvin?
DELILAH

He's very supportive.

TANDY
Isn't he worried you might get hurt?

DELILAH
I s'pose so. Anything happens, at
least he's a doctor.
87.

TANDY
Yeah, that's right. The way you two
met. You got yourself a story right
there. All this time spent trying
to hook up at the bar... I shoulda
tried the ER.

DELILAH
(chuckles)
So uh... do you have a boyfriend?
TANDY

No. I don't.
An uncomfortable silence.

TANDY
You two have gone out quite some
time, haven't you?

DELILAH
"Bout five months.

TANDY
You think he might be the one?

DELILAH
Sure feels like it.

TANDY
How do you know?

DELILAH
(mulls it over)
Because I don't have to ask.

Tandy realizes that's checkmate. She curls her frown of
discontent into a smile, for Delilah's sake.

TANDY
You know, you're gonna need to attract
more attention if you wanna get Kelvin
in the ring with you. And for that,
you need a gimmick.

DELILAH
You mean like a silk jacket with my
name sewn on the back?

TANDY
Hell no. Everyone's got that. We
need something bigger.
INT. ARENA -- NIGHT

With Tandy at her side, Delilah makes her way toward the
ring in a RED HOOPSKIRT. The CROWD loves her.
88.
MONTAGE
1) Delilah glides toward the ring in a GREEN hoopskirt.
2) She electrifies the crowd as she knocks out her OPPONENT.
3) Another bout, Delilah in an ORANGE hoopskirt.

4) Delilah, Nate and Abby sit on a park bench eating ice
cream.

DELILAH

So how'd it go again?
ABBY

(miming)

Uppercut, jab, straight right.
DELILAH

Good girl. Has he bothered you since?
ABBY

I'm not sure we still go to the same

school.

5) Delilah at her locker. She notices that her engagement
ring has been returned, spots Slice sneaking away.

6) Delilah enters Tandy's office. Tandy sits at her desk.

DELILAH
Do you keep a Lost 'n Found?

TANDY
Back here, in a box.

DELILAH
Can you add this to it?

She hands her the engagement ring.
7) Romeo sews a YELLOW hoopskirt as Delilah skips rope.

8) Delilah enters the ring in a YELLOW hoopskirt and matching
parasol.

INT. OFFICE WAITING AREA -- DAY

Tandy sits rigidly in a chair, eyes a magazine on a table.
Behind the desk, a buxom RECEPTIONIST, 20s, without a bra.

BRALESS
Miss Burrows, Mr. Naddle will see
you now.
89.
INT. MR. NADDLE'S OFFICE -- DAY
Tandy enters.

TANDY
Mr. Naddle.

MR. NADDLE, 40s, is a Slippery fucker - no really, he is -
his pomade starts just above his eyebrows and ends somewhere
around the back of his collar. His smile reveals an
assortment of unhealthy colors. His suit is circa Seventies.

MR. NADDLE
Ms. Burrows. What brings you here?

He leans back in his swivel chair and props up his feet.
Wouldn't you know, he's wearing beach sandals. Eight toes,
and only seven of them are equipped with an ingrown nail.

TANDY
(looking away)
My client would like to formally
challenge your fighter, Mr. Wingfield,
to a three-round bout.

She turns to look him in the eye, but his grin snaps her
back into shape.

MR. NADDLE
I'd be happy to run the idea past
him...

Tandy gives in to temptation again. She catches an eyeful
of Mr. Naddle slipping his hand down the front of his pants.

TANDY
(jerks away)
God.

MR. NADDLE
Is something the matter?

TANDY
No. I just...

She looks up, in time to see him sniff his excavating hand.

TANDY
(trying not to heave)
You can let me know. I don't want
to be late for my pap smear.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Delilah sips a mint julep in a corner booth. Tandy arrives.
90.

TANDY
Sorry I'm late. Had a fight with my
landlord.

DELILAH
That's okay.

TANDY
Whatcha drinking there?

DELILAH
Mint julep. Want one?

TANDY
No thanks.
(to WAITRESS)
Sam Adams, please. And another julep
for her.

DELILAH
Thanks.

TANDY
Don't mention it.

DELILAH
(eager for info)
So?

TANDY
Oh right. I guess one of the tenants
complained that I was blasting k.d.
lang all day. And I'm like, Grits-
for-Brains, I'm at the gym all day.
So it couldn't be me. Besides, I
don't even like k.d. lang. So what
does this asshole do? He starts
searching my apartment for k.d. lang.
Tossing pillows, moving furniture.
I felt like Tim Robbins in that --
what was that prison picture?

DELILAH
Shawshank Redemption.

TANDY
Right. Can you fuckin' believe that
movie didn't win a single Oscar?

DELILAH
No, I meant, what'd you find out?
Did you hear back from his manager?

Tandy turns solemn. The dog and pony show's over.
91.

TANDY
I'm sorry, Sweetie. He said No.

The bottom falls out from under Delilah.

DELILAH
Why not?

TANDY
Probably cuz he's scared. But I'm
sure he'll tell his society friends
something different.

DELILAH
That's awful. You mean all this was
just...

TANDY

I can see how it feels that way.
But look at you, you're in the best
shape of your life. You started
something that six months ago you
probably thought you'd never do.
You met some new people...

DELILAH
I know but...

TANDY
(disappointed)
Should count for something.

DELILAH
It does but... I'm not sure where
I'm at if the fight doesn't happen.

TANDY
You're in a bar. Having a drink.
With me.

She props her elbows on the table, dejected.

DELILAH
(stirs her drink)
Can I ask you somethin'?

Tandy tilts her head.

DELILAH
What do you do when it feels like
you're just out there, twistin' in
the wind?

TANDY
I pretend like I'm flying.
92.

Delilah's eyes drift to a burn mark on the inside of Tandy's
forearm.

DELILAH
What happened there?

Tandy brings her arms down to her lap.

TANDY
It's nothing. Just my ex-. He could
be pretty creative sometimes.

EXT. DRIVE-IN -- NIGHT

Delilah finds comfort on Nate's shoulder. They watch a grainy
black and white film.

NATE
You can always go back to beauty
pageants, can't you?

DELILAH
Think I'm done tryin' to look the
part of someone perfect. Smiled so
darn much, it hurts when I don't.

NATE
Doesn't have to be a bad thing.

DELILAH
This might've been the first thing I
ever wanted, that I'm sure came from
me. My mother had nothin' to do
with it.
(beat)
Wanna hear somethin' funny?

NATE
Definitely not.

DELILAH
Kelvin 'n Marney are gettin' married
this Saturday. Saw it in the paper.

NATE
Funny pages?

DELILAH
Naturally.

NATE

We weren't invited?

DELILAH
Course we were invited. We'll be
sharin' a table with three porn stars
and the Easter Bunny.
93.

NATE
Festive.

They share a laugh.

DELILAH
God, we have really gone off our
pecan, haven't we?

NATE
Seriously though, they should have
invited you.

DELILAH
Are you out o' your cotton ball
pickin' mind?

NATE
You sort of brought those two lowlifes
together, didn't you?

Delilah makes like she's gonna punch Nate in the arm, then...

DELILAH
(light bulb)
You're right. I did bring those two
lowlifes together.

INT. RECEPTION HALL -- NIGHT

Large group of FOLKS. At the head table, Kelvin and Marney
smooch. Best Man steps up to the mike.

BEST MAN
Hello, everyone. Good night. Er
um, I mean, Good evening. Shoot. I
already screwed up.

Kelvin shares a chuckle with the Folks.

BEST MAN
Just wanna say... how proud I am to
be Kelvin's best man. I can still
remember the first time I met Marney.

Marney's fake smile shrivels a tad.

BEST MAN
She just had... so much energy. You
know? Tons and tons of spunk. Inside
of her. And um, I just think the
decision is umaninous. I mean,
umaminous. No wait. Unaminous.
Sorry. U-nan-i-mous.

A few mock cheers.
94.

BEST MAN
They're just made for each other.

The Folks applaud. A lean FIGURE ambles toward the mike.
She wears a bonnet and funky fuchsia shades.

DELILAH
Good evenin'. How y'all doin'?

The disguise comes off.

BUCK
Get down! She's got a bomb!

In a loud, ugly rumble the Folks hit the deck.

DELILAH
Don't be silly. I don't have a bomb.
Or did you just say, she's the bomb?

She laughs, the Folks make their way back up to their chairs.

DELILAH

Honestly, you should move to Hollywood
with an imagination like that. Kelvin
and Marney, so nice to see you...

(waves )
I'm sorry to startle you nice folks.
I don't make a habit of crashin'
weddings. But I needed a large group
of understandin' people, and naturally
this is the first place I thought
of. I'd like all y'all to meet my
boyfriend, Doctor Nate More.

Nate offers a brief wave from the back of the room.

DELILAH
Doctor More works over at County
Hospital. And for those of you who
don't know, the hospital's in need
of more space. But they lack the
necessary funds. Some o' the patients
there wind up gettin' treated in the
hallway. It's happened to me. Raise
your hand if this's happened to you.

The Folks look at each other bewildered.

DELILAH
Go on, don't be shy.

Some of the older Folks raise their hands.
95.

DELILAH
See, Nate 'n I didn't care for that.
So we went ahead and started up a
charity drive. It's called Room to
Grow. Now why am I tellin' you nice
folks this? Well, I'd like to take
this opportunity to invite Mr.
Wingfield here to join me in the
ring.

Kelvin smirks at his constituency, wags his finger at Delilah.

DELILAH
All proceeds from the bout would go
toward expandin' the hospital. 'Fore

you know it, y'all won't have to

leave your flowers out in the hall
when you go visit Grandma after she
falls 'n breaks her hip. Or when
Grandpa throws out his back. Wouldn't
that be nice?

Nods and murmurs of agreement.

DELILAH
I can't speak for Kelvin, but I find
boxin' to be empowerin', ya know?
It's changed my life entirely. And
I just think if there's a way of
improvin' someone else's life, by
golly I'm gonna do it. Amazin' what
throwin' a few punches can do. Wanna
try it with me?

She throws a slow series of left and right jabs, alternating.

DELILAH
Come on now. It's just me.

Some of the Folks begin to jab. One "misfire" and Best Man
falls flat on his back.

DELILAH
Itn't it fun? Everybody! You, too,
bridegroom.
(chants)

KELVIN... KELVIN... KELVIN...

The number of Folks jabbing, and chanting, grows and grows.
Until the only ones left silent are Kelvin and Marney.

Delilah grins from ear to ear as she punches away. She mouths
to her ex: "See you in the ring."
96.
INT. KELVIN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- DAY

Kelvin broods over the society pages. A topless Marney plops
down in a chair, holding a small gift. Bites into her toast.

KELVIN
Whatcha got there?

MARNEY
Delilah's present. Handed it toa
bridesmaid on her way out.

KELVIN
She's a clever one, isn't she?

MARNEY
Always was. Ever since we were kids.
Any idea when the fight would happen?

KELVIN
They're supposed to get in touch
with Nads tomorrow. If she wants
the fight so bad, then who am I to
stop her?

MARNEY
(unwrapping gift)
Think it's poisonous?
KELVIN
Point that thing away from me. It's
probably radioactive.
Marney opens the box.
A NALONI BUCINTORO WATCH
shines bright from inside. Marney quickly shuts the box.

She looks down at herself like it just dawned on her that
she's half naked. Rushes out of the room with box in hand.

KELVIN
So... what'd she get us?

MARNEY (0.S.)
Nothing special. I'm gonna go get
dressed.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - KITCHEN -- DAY

Delilah and Samuel eat breakfast at the table. Mirabelle
washes dishes.

SAMUEL
So how would it happen?
Mirabelle

Really?
Mirabelle

She leaps

97.

DELILAH
Well, it wouldn't be sanctioned, so
I guess we'd have to raise the money
ourselves to rent out a club.

chortles her disapproval.

SAMUEL
I can think of at least two places
that would give you a good rate.

MIRABELLE
People should know when they're making
total fools of themselves.

DELILAH
Thanks, Daddy. I appreciate you
doin' that.

SAMUEL

My pleasure, Honeybee.

MIRABELLE
You're unbelievable, you two. I
think you may have retired a bit too
early, Samuel. You have far too
much time on your hands.

SAMUEL
You know what? I think I might have
a better idea.

DELILAH
What's that?

SAMUEL
Why not have it here?

DELILAH MIRABELLE
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

turns the water off.

SAMUEL
Why not? I think we have the space,
we could rent another tent.

DELILAH
That would be fantastic, Daddy!

up and kisses her father on the forehead.

MIRABELLE
You can ignore me all you want. But
there will be NO boxing match at
this house. Is that understood? I
won't stand for it.
98.
SAMUEL
No. You will stand for it. This is
our house. And this is something
our daughter wants. If you don't
want to be part of it, that's your
prerogative. And your loss.
Mirabelle SMASHES the dishes in the sink and scampers away.

DELILAH
Was that a rebuttal?

SAMUEL
I don't know. The conversation sort
of tailed off when she ran away.
They look at each other askew... then burst out laughing.
INT. TANDY'S BOXING GYM -- DAY
Delilah batters a speed bag senseless.

DELILAH
Kiss My GRITS.

MONTAGE
1) Delilah whales on a heavy bag that Hank holds.
2) She spars with Romeo who fears for his life.

3) Slice applies makeup in the mirror. Behind her, Delilah
nods her head approvingly.

4) Delilah does incline presses. Tandy spots her.

TANDY
Bring it home, Goldilocks!

DELILAH
(straining)
You said you weren't gonna call me
that.
5) She skips rope in the gym parking lot.
6) Delilah practices slips using the weighted rope.

ROMEO
Is our show on tonight?

DELILAH
It's a repeat.

ROMEO
Those bastards!
99.

7) With MUSIC playing, she waltzes with Tandy in the ring.
Slice waltzes with Hank outside the ring.

8) Delilah thrashes SlamMan, still in his tux.

9) She jogs through the streets of Savannah, passes Vendors
selling vegetables. Delilah swipes a peach.

She turns, throws up a Hail Mary. The peach hits the Vendor
in the chest, all over his white shirt. He's tickled pink.

10) Delilah's jog continues. She tails away from the crowd,
from the noise, from just about everything, chasing a sunset.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD (IN RED): FIGHT NIGHT

The BELL tolls.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - GUEST ROOM -- NIGHT

Kelvin, in red trunks, shadowboxes in front of the mirror.

Buck, Chuck, Tuck and the Best Man, all dressed up, toss
around a Nerf football.

BEST MAN
Never thought I'd see the inside of
this place again.

BUCK
Yo Kel, you're battin' a thousand in
this room, eh?

KELVIN
Damn straight.
(blows snot on floor)
A knock. Kelvin motions to Chuck, he answers the door.
CHUCK
(stage whisper)
It's Mitzi.

Kelvin searches the few files in his brain: Mitzi... Mitzi...
He turns to the mirror and combs his weeny moustache.

KELVIN
Okay, let her in.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAH'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Delilah stands in her bathrobe before the full-length mirror.
Tandy and Charlene wrap her hands.
100.

CHARLENE
Am I doing it right?

TANDY
You're doing great.

DELILAH
Have you been workin' out?

CHARLENE
Yup. Started on the treadmill.
Lost seven pounds.

DELILAH
Good for you, it shows.

CHARLENE
Thanks.

Tandy smiles at Charlene, turns to Delilah.
EXT. MACINTOSH ESTATE -- NIGHT
Marney climbs out of her black Beamer. TWO PAPARAZZI appear.
PAPARAZZO ONE
There she is. Homewrecker
extraordinaire. Smile for us, Babe.
(snaps picture)

MARNEY
Fuck off.

PAPARAZZO TWO
Surprised she'd show her face here.

MARNEY
It's for charity, Jerk-offs.

Flash bulbs light up the night.

INT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Marney glides along with a scowl, turns a corner and spots

A WOMAN

running in the opposite direction. Vanishes around a corner.
Marney places her hand on the doorknob to the Guest Room,

and the door bursts open. Kelvin and his entourage high-
five each other as they exit. They walk right by Marney.

MARNEY
Hellooo. I need to talk to you.
101.

KELVIN
Hellooo. Boxing.
(punches the air)
Ring a bell?

Marney stands with her mouth agape as they strut away.

CHUCK
Does this mean I'm not a virgin no
more?

BEST MAN

No way, dude. That's cheatin'.

CHUCK
Why is that cheating?

BUCK
Cuz it is, pencildick.

TUCK
But we'll give you an E for effort.

EXT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - BACKYARD - TENT -- NIGHT

Balloons, streamers, confetti. It could pass for a wedding.
Kelvin and his gang make their way down the aisle. A sold-
out crowd of FANS greet them with RASPBERRIES and CATCALLS.
Mr. Naddle joins the procession, clad in a leopard-skin suit.
He smiles at the unruly Fans, scaring some of the children.
IN THE CROWD

Nate and Abby nosh on fried dough. Abby wears a pretty dress,
and it looks like Nate has gotten himself a haircut.

RINGSIDE

A TALL WOMAN in black sits next to Marney. Her smile reveals
a snaggletooth. Marney flinches, looks down at her new watch.

SNAGGLETOOTH
My, that's purty.

EXT. MACINTOSH ESTATE - RING -- NIGHT

Kelvin bounces up and down in his silk jacket, loosening up.
The Minister, now dressed in a tux, straightens his bow tie.

MINISTER
(into mike)
Dearly Beloved... Good evening, and
WELCOME... to the ENGAGEMENT OF
ENRAGEMENT.

The Fans HOOT and CHEER.
102.
MINISTER
In this corner, wearing red trunks,
weighing in at one hundred and twelve
noble pounds... SIR KELVIN WINGFIELD.

BooS fill the tent. Kelvin's clan disses the Fans. Mr.
Naddle finds solace in his pants.

The lights suddenly go out.
A spotlight appears at the
ENTRANCE TO THE AISLE

The brass Quintet plays the opening bars of Mendelssohn's
WEDDING MARCH.

Stepping forward into the light are...

DELILAH AND SAMUEL

Samuel in a tuxedo, and Delilah in a WEDDING DRESS and VEIL.
IN THE RING

Kelvin's EYES widen in terror.

The bride and her father walk proudly, smiling at each other.

Team Delilah follows: Charlene, Tandy, Slice, Hank, Romeo,
and the Flower Girl, scattering magnolia petals.

MINISTER (0.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, weighing in at

one hundred and eight pounds... The

Jabbing Julep... The Bride who

Cried... The Belle From Hell...

DELILAH MACINTOSH.
The crowd ERUPTS. Team Delilah takes the
RING
by storm. Jumping, hopping, dancing, whatever you like.
Delilah meets Kelvin in the center of the ring for the
STARE DOWN
Delilah pushes her veil out of the way, stares through Kelvin.

KELVIN
I'll go easy on you, don't worry.

DELILAH
Don't make promises you can't keep.
103.
Kelvin does his best to hide his fear.
DELILAH'S CORNER
Tandy takes delight in tearing off Delilah's dress.
DELILAH

That's as close as I came to a

honeymoon.
KELVIN'S CORNER
Kelvin puts in his mouth guard.

BEST MAN
Watch out, Kel. Here Comes the --

BELL. Delilah charges at Kelvin, THROTTLES him with a right.

BEST MAN
Bride.

Delilah unleashes a flurry of jabs that backs Kelvin into a
corner. He covers up.

Kelvin then surprises her with a right uppercut.

KELVIN
You like that? I was savin' it.

Delilah drops back to the center of the ring.

KELVIN
I'm glad we have this time to catch
up. Get ready to be whooped,
Honeybunch.

He lands a double jab.
DELILAH
I'd throw a low blow, but that
wouldn't do any good.

She throws a body shot, but he parries it. Kelvin counters
with a one-two that stuns her.

KELVIN
By the time I'm done with you, you
won't be able to model for Fangoria.
He delivers a triple jab.

DELILAH
I bet you say that to all the ladies.

TANDY (0.S.)
Keep your cool, Delilah!
104.
Kelvin slips her left hook and counters with a right cross.
Kelvin rains down punches. Delilah's saved by the BELL.
DELILAH'S CORNER
Hank sets down a stool. Romeo and Slice tend to her eyes.
TANDY
What's all this talking? This ain't
therapy. Keep your guard up and
your mouth shut.
SLICE
Don't waste any o' your energy talking
to that scumbag.
ROMEO
This guy takes it in the ass, Delilah.
Believe me.
They all turn to look at Romeo.
KELVIN'S CORNER
Mr. Naddle rubs Vaseline under Kelvin's eyes.
MR. NADDLE
You don't owe this girl nothing.
Take her out in the second so we can
all get hummers and go home.
The BELL.
Delilah walks straight into a combination by Kelvin.
She counters with a body shot that makes him laugh.

KELVIN
You never could go down, could you.

Delilah throws a triple jab but he slips all of them easily.
A straight right opens Delilah's left eye.

KELVIN
Ohpp. Somebody got a booboo.

Delilah downshifts to her box step, throwing up weak jabs.
KELVIN
Are we dancing now? Is that what
we're doing?

An uppercut throws her off balance and out of rhythm. Delilah
sneaks a peek at Tandy who for the first time looks worried.
105.
She turns back and Kelvin drops her with a right cross!
DELILAH'S HEAD SWIMS

As the Referee counts, a FLASHBACK of Delilah winning her
first beauty pageant. Mirabelle sneers from the audience.

Delilah struggles to her feet at the count of seven.
Kelvin charges, right into a juicy LOW BLOw.

REFEREE
Nothing below the belt.

DELILAH
(smirks)
I agree.

The BELL. Kelvin worms back to his corner.
RINGSIDE

Charlene spies Mirabelle peeking from Delilah's bedroom
window. Mirabelle backs out of view, tripping over SlamMan.

Meanwhile, Snaggletooth sucks on a cigar. She blows a smoke
ring toward Kelvin.

SNAGGLETOOTH
Man, his butt sure dudn't quit, does
it? Some thangs never change...

MARNEY
You know him?

SNAGGLETOOTH
You could say that. Him AND that
cast of characters he hangs around
with. Not a single one of ‘em knows
how to satisfy a woman, but together
they sure do make music.

MARNEY
What do you mean?

SNAGGLETOOTH
I like to think of it as group
therapy. Now -- Kelvin -- he's the
smallest one o' the bunch.

She uses her cigar as a visual aid.
106.

SNAGGLETOOTH
But let me tell ya... that boy... he
can really shoot.
(wipes her mouth)

Marney pulls back in disgust.

MARNEY
How long ago was this?

SNAGGLETOOTH
(eyes Marney's watch)
I dunno, what time you got?

DELILAH'S CORNER
Blood trickles from her eye. Slice presses down on it.

TANDY
This guy humiliated you in front of
everyone. You remember? Now's your
chance to make it right.

DELILAH
I thought you said boxin' wasn't
about anger.

TANDY
Who said anything about getting angry?

The BELL. They meet in the center of the ring.

REFEREE
Touch gloves and fight.

DELILAH
I ain't touchin' him. He's probably
been with ev'ry woman here. And
Marney, too.

Kelvin grins. They stand toe-to-toe, eyeing each other.

KELVIN
I have a confession to make.
(jabs)
DELILAH

Erectile dysfunction is highly
treatable these days.
(jabs)

KELVIN
Marney and I fucked on our wedding
day.
(left hook)
107.

DELILAH
Well lollipops to you. Did you do
her in the reception hall or in the
rectory?
(right cross)

KELVIN
No I mean we fucked on OUR wedding
day.

While he's busy gesticulating "me and you", Delilah deposits
a straight right, right in the KISSER.

KELVIN
Hold on now.

A FLASHBACK of Delilah swinging and missing on her wedding
day. BACK TO PRESENT. Same punch. She CONNECTS.

KELVIN
Take it easy, Honeybunch.

Another FLASHBACK of another miss. BACK TO PRESENT. She
ROCKS his world.

 

DELILAH
Still think you're gonna whoop me?
KELVIN
I do.
DELILAH
What was that?
KELVIN
I DO.
DELILAH

Now was that so hard to say?
She unloads a LEFT HOOK that spins her ex-fiancé like a top.
Down to the mat! The Fans GO NUTS!

DELILAH
(standing over him)

Capeesh?!
A Trumpeter plays TAPS as the Referee counts down Kelvin.
He's OUT!
Team Delilah rushes the ring.

Charlene places a pageant tiara atop her sister's head.
108.

CHARLENE
No sense having it collect dust.

They hug. Samuel ruffles Delilah's hair.

SAMUEL
I'm proud of you.

DELILAH
Thanks, Daddy. You, too.

Meanwhile, Hank and Romeo stir the Fans into a frenzy,
chanting: DELILAH, DELILAH... Even Slice joins in.

Delilah turns and Tandy KISSES her full on the lips.

TANDY
I mean... Congratulations!
DELILAH
(blushes)

Thanks!

As she waves to the crowd, Nate and Abby enter the ring.
Nate taps the Minister on the shoulder.

Kelvin begins to snap out of it, just in time to see Nate
get down on one knee in the center of the ring with mike in
hand. The crowd goes APESHIT.

It dawns on Delilah to turn around and see what all the hubbub
is about. Her eyes POP.

NATE
Miss Delilah, will you marry me?
(brandishes the ring)

DELILAH
"DEED I WILL.

Nate slides the engagement ring onto her

FINGER

It covers the mark left by the old one. She beams.
They kiss. Confetti fills the air surrounding them.
FADE OUT

THE END
