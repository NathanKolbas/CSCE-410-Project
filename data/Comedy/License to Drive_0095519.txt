"LICENSE TO DRIVE"

FADE IN:

EXT. COMMERCIAL SUBURBAN STREET - COLD FOGGY MORNING

No cars. Swirls of newspapers blow across the street.
Suddenly, a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS BECOMES VISIBLE, rising over a
hill. As it gets nearer, we feel the ROAR of the engine.
The bus is a monster. As it rumbles by us we SEE "SUNNY
MEADOWS HIGH SCHOOL" inscribed on the side.

INSIDE THE SCHOOL BUS

Grimy. Run down. School Bus Hell. Oppressed grey-faced
HIGH SCHOOLERS sit round-shouldered, looking out into nowhere
land.

WE DOLLY SLOWLY ALONG the floor TO REVEAL all the students'
ankles SHACKLED and CHAINED to their seats. The faint rhythm
of a FILE RUBBING AGAINST STEEL becomes louder and louder
until the CAMERA STOPS ON a student's hands. Seconds away
from filing through the lock on his shackle... FREEDOM.

The CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL LES ANDERSON, sixteen, maybe
seventeen. He's the only kid on the bus with a spark of life
left in him.

As the bus stops at a RED LIGHT, something catches Les' eye.
LES' P.O.V. - THROUGH A GREASY WINDOW - A RED BLUR

He wipes the window, revealing a RED FERRARI 308 GIB parked
beside the bus, outside a CORNER GROCERY STORE. The T-ROOF
is off, and all we CAN SEE are the LONGEST, MOST BEAUTIFUL

LEGS lounging in the passenger seat. A GUY walks away from
the car into the store.

LES

lecks to the back of the bus, to the REAR DOOR, clearly
marked "FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY." He teeters on the edge of
his seat, about to make a move. He looks to the front of the
bus, at the:

BUS DRIVER

A maniac: mid-40s, lousy toupee. He's been watching Les in
his rearview mirror the entire time. They stare at each
other, eye to eye. Les holds his ground. The driver thrusts
the bus in gear and begins to pull away... away from the
Ferrari.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

Les explodes from his seat, charging for the "emergency
door." The kids come to life, watching and screaming with
excitement. Les kicks at the door.

A RED WARNING LIGHT on the Driver's dash flashes. An ALARM
sounds. The Driver looks back, angrily. Then pushes a
button.

A STEEL BOLT slams across the door. Les slams through the 7
back window -- diving out of the bus onto the street. Les
bounces out of a COMMANDO ROLL and runs up the street to the
Ferrari.

The bus does a spectacular BOOTLEGGER'S turn. It's coming
back.

LES LOOKS INTO THE FERRARI

Keys dangle from the ignition. In the passenger seat is the
LEGGIEST BLONDE GIRL you've ever seen. The approaching bus
builds speed. Les jumps into the car.

She smiles, seductively. He smiles back. They're in love.

The bus screams towards them. Les turns the ignition, pops
the clutch, then squeals into a right turn slicing onto a:

QUIET TREE-LINED SUBURBAN STREET

The bus roars after them, barely making the turn, balancing
on two wheels.

LES RACES DOWN THE STREET

Looks at his speedometer: 70... 75... 80... 85. Maple trees
whip by like he's in a rocket ship. AWESOME! He looks up at
his rearview mirror. It's all yellow. Miraculously, the bus
is right on his tail. Suddenly:

A LITTLE BOY DELIVERING PAPERS

Hops the curb and bicycles across the street. Les, about to
hit him, yanks the wheel left, practically tearing it off its
column. The bus bombs by, slicing the front tire off the
bike. The LITTLE BOY is left there on his seat, spinning
around acrobatically on his back tire.

THE FERRARI

still trying to lose the bus, streaks down a street, then
screeches into:

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

NARROW BACK ALLEY

So narrow they spell it with one "1". The bus slams in,
rocking and rebounding off the alley's walls. Dragging power
cords and live wires, sparks shoot out from the bus' sides.

Les jams on his brakes, cuts and slides right onto a:
WIDE COMMERCIAL STREET

Les guns it! A laser beam. With one hand he downshifts to
accelerate, with the other, he starts to light the girl's
cigarette... She pulls his hand closer to her, looking into
his eyes.

But WAIT! Up ahead, by a GAS STATION, there's a HUGE PUDDLE
OF WATER. But it's not water. It's GAS! A tank pumps gas
into a tanker fuel truck. GAS spews from a ruptured hose.
Suddenly, we hear a BORING MONOTONE voice.

VOICE OVER
Remember. Be prepared and look
ahead. The driver must see the BIG
PICTURE...

CUT TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

A dark classroom. The sound of a projector. Flickering
light. An instructional film is being shown to a class of
DRIVER'S ED STUDENTS. The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the room and
stops in back where we FIND Les Anderson, head on his desk,
fast asleep, resting on his DRIVER'S ED BOOKS.

VOICE OVER
«+eIn heavier rain, your tires may
begin to 'hydroplane,' ride on the
water, rather than the pavement.
Don't panic! And especially don't
jam on the brakes. Ease your foot
off the gas pedal.

INT. FERRARI - DAY

High speed. There's no avoiding the puddle. Les EASES HIS
FOOT off the gas pedal. The Ferrari remains steady as a 15-
foot spray of gas erupts on either side of the car. He
finishes lighting the girl's cigarette, then casually tosses
the match out the window.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

INSIDE THE BUS

The driver shifts gears with reckless abandon, charging for
the puddle. Suddenly, the puddle ignites. There's a HUGE
EXPLOSION. The bus driver JAMMMMS on his brakes. Headed
straight for it.

INSIDE THE FERRARI

Les and the girl hear the explosion and turn around
simultaneously. There's no bus, just a huge WALL OF FLAME.
They smile at each other. They've made it... Les leans over
to kiss her, but suddenly she's not smiling. Her mouth is
open in shock. There's terror in her eyes. We hear the ROAR
OF AN ENGINE. Les looks back at the road.

THE BUS IS HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THEM

about to smash into them. WE HEAR a LOUD HORN which becomes
a SCHOOL BELL.

INSERT - SCHOOL BELL

INT. CLASSROOM - CLOSE ON LES - DAY

He wakes up, startled. He has sleep marks on one side of his
face. He looks around, embarrassed. The bell stops.

Standing in front of him is the DRIVER'S ED TEACHER, MR.
GASKET, the bus driver from the dream. The class is getting
up from their desks, leaving. He motions for Les not to
move.

Leaving the class, A VERY CUTE GIRL turns to Les' twin
sister, NATALIE -- she's conservative, bookish.

CUTE GIRL
(low voice)
Does your brother have mono or
something? He slept through the
entire course.

NATALIE
No, he's just brain dead.

The class empties. Mr. Gasket stands ominously above Les.
MR. GASKET
(dead serious)

Mr. Anderson.
(MORE )

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:
MR. GASKET (cont'd)
It's punks like you the paramedics
end up scraping off the roads at
four in the morning.
(beat)
For your own sake and the safety of
others, I hope you fail your
driver's exam.

Les gets up to leave. Gasket signals to stay, then throws
him a piece of chalk. Les rolls his eyes.
EXT. SUNNY MEADOWS HIGH - DAY (BEGIN CREDITS)

Kids load into YELLOW SCHOOL BUSES and fancy cars.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

LINES. Blackboards full of "I WILL DRIVE SAFELY. I WILL
DRIVE SAFELY..." Les finishes his last one and flies out of
class.

EXT. SUNNY MEADOWS HIGH - DAY

Buses and cars begin to pull away.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Deserted. Sprinting. Les slides to his locker and quickly
unlocks it. An avalanche of books and junk fall onto the
floor. He stuffs it back in.

EXT. SUNNY MEADOWS HIGH - DAY

A few kids here and there. Les bombs out of school, jamming
papers into his knapsack. He runs down the street after the
last departing school bus. He can't catch it. Natalie,
inside the bus, smiles at him. He stands in the middle of
the road, pissed. We hear a car racing towards him from
behind.

IT'S A RED FERRARI
The one from the dream. T-roof off. Music blares. MERCEDES
LANE, the leggy blonde girl from the dream, sits in the

passenger seat. PAOLO, her GQ Latin American boyfriend,
drives. They're in their own perfect world.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

Les jumps out of the way as it screams by him. He watches
the Ferrari drive off.

We hear a bicycle tire SKIDDING along the pavement. He turns
to see:

A "nut case" on a ten speed stop his thirty foot skid a hair
away from Les' sneaker. This is DEAN, Les' best friend. He
has charm and mischief with a capital M written all over his
face.

They both look back at the Ferrari.

LES
You know, Dean, I can't help
wondering whether it'll ever get
that good for me.

DEAN

Anderson, the only difference
between you and that greaseball, is
that he has a license and you
don't. In two days we open a whole
new chapter.

(motioning to his handle

bars)
Get in. I'll drive you home.

Les looks at Dean's BEAT TO SHIT death trap bike.

LES
Unh, unh. Too much is at stake.
They'll never let me take my
driver's exam in traction.

DEAN
Les, your license is as important

to me as it is to you. I'll take
it easy. I promise.

EXT. SUBURBAN MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

White knuckles. Les hangs on as a sadistic Dean speeds along
the sidewalk. About to collide with a JOGGER, Dean cuts
onto:

THE STREET

zigzagging in and out of TRAFFIC. A HONK here, a honk there.
Dean JOLTS the bike back up on the SIDEWALK.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

Les tries to absorb the shock. Dean laughs, pedals faster.
He whips Les through:

LOW HANGING BRANCHES

They flap against Les' face. Dean's having a riot. Les
wants to start one. The torturous branches give way to:

LES' P.O.V. - A FEROCIOUS DOG CHAINED ON A PORCH

Dean has the bike headed straight for it. Its mouth
salivates. As Dean swerves Les by it, the dog runs and pulls
his chain taut, swinging out against an imaginary wall.

EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - DEAN TURNS INTO THE DRIVEWAY

making sure to run Les through a SPRINKLER. This is Les'
house; large and colonial, its landscaping perfectly groomed.
Ahead of them, in front of the garage, there's an Audi 5000
Turbo. It's surrounded by mounds of dusty boxes and garage
junk. Dean slaloms through it.

EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - A 1972 CADILLAC SEDAN
DEVILLE

sits parked at an angle, barely squeezing in. Sky blue.
Gleaming chrome. It's in mint condition. Dean and Les ride
in. Dean jams on the brakes. Les slides painfully off the
handlebars. He gives Dean a dirty look. END OF CREDITS.

DEAN
Just a painful reminder of what
you're leaving behind.
(beat)
Whose Caddie?

LES
My grandfather's. Can you believe
it's sixteen years old? It only
has twenty thousand miles on it.

Dean gets off his bike and lets it crash to the ground.
DEAN
(examining it)

It's intense. What's it doing
here?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

LES
He's afraid to take it on long
trips so he borrowed my dad's car
for a week.

DEAN
(opening the door)
I gotta tell you, Les, this boat
would kick-ass up at Archie’s. Do
you think we can get it for
Saturday night?

DAD
(o.s8.)
Not a chance in hell, Dean.

They turn. It's Les' DAD -- good-looking, early forties, he
wears grimy work clothes. He walks into the garage, removes
Dean's hand from the door, and buffs the chrome.

DAD
You have a better chance of winning
the Nobel Prize for physics than
you do of getting in this car.

Les looks at Dean as if to say "Does that answer your
question?"

LES
Hi Dad.
DAD
(to the boys)

How ‘bout a hand helping me move
this junk?

DEAN
(picking up his bike)
I'd really love to, Mr. Anderson,
(a fake cough)
but I'm sort of allergic to dust
and cardboard boxes.

He coughs again. Dad doesn't even bother. Dean gets on his
bike.

DEAN

(driving off)
See you tonight.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

LES
Dad? Do you think you could tell
me for sure if I can use Mom's car
Saturday night?

DAD
(shoving a dusty box at
him)
Do me a favor, will ya, Les? Just
pass your driver's exam. And then
we'll talk.

INT. KITCHEN DINING AREA - NIGHT

Dad, Les, Natalie and Rudy sit at the table. Rudy is the
cute, ten year old brother you can only find in the movies.
As they munch away at their dinner, one by one they look up
in awe...

THEIR P.O.V. - MOM

Looking more like nine years pregnant, rather than nine
months, she carries the most humongous plate of mashed
potatoes, spotted with mini-pickles, chocolate chips and
potato chips. Instead of putting it in the center of the
table, she plops it down in front of her table setting.

With the family still looking on disgustedly, she picks up
the ketchup bottle, and starts squirting it out on her food
(HAPPY FACE)...

MOM
For your information, this is
exactly what I ate when I was
pregnant with all of you.

She downs her first bite. It scares them back to their
meals.

LES
Dad?

DAD
Unh, unh.

LES

Did you get a chance to look at
those brochures?

(CONTINUED )
10.
CONTINUED:

DAD
(pulling a crumpled
brochure from his back
pocket)
Sure did.

LES
Well? What do you think?

DAD
(flipping through it)
A twenty-three thousand dollar BMW
for a sixteen year old kid who's
never had a job in his life? I
think it's a great idea.

Les is humiliated.

DAD
Les, you only completed your
driver's ed course two hours ago.
You don't even have a license yet.

LES
But Dad, it wouldn't be just for
me. It would be for Natalie too.

NATALIE
Don't include me in your obsession.

LES
Excuse me, Miss Mature. Is there
anything wrong with being American?

NATALIE
A BMW at sixteen? It's more like
spoiled. Karl says...

Everyone stops what they're doing ala E. F. Hutton.

NATALIE

Can you people please be serious
for once in your life?

(beat)
Karl says that in America the
people are misled to believe that a
car represents freedom and
individuality, when, in essence, it
is more oppressive than anything
else, burdening the individual with
materialistic costs, such as
insurance, gas and repairs.

(CONTINUED )
11.
CONTINUED:

LES
Who cares what your Commie
boyfriend thinks? I think we'd all
prefer to be burdened with the cost
of an automobile, than with bread
lines and two year waiting lists
for a washing machine.

RUDY
I agree.

Mother starts to boil.

NATALIE
You two are so simple, it's
frightening.

LES
Why are you even getting your
license?

NATALIE
(upset and getting up from
the table)
I'm not hungry.

MOM
Natalie, if you prefer to eat
standing up, that's fine with me.
But nobody leaves the table until
we finish eating.

NATALIE
This is the most oppressive
environment a child could be
subjected to.

Natalie sits down. We hear a loud HONK-HONK! Les stands up.

LES
(wiping his mouth)
That's for me.

MOM
You heard me Les. Whoever it is
will have to wait a few minutes.

LES

(still standing)
But, Maaa.

(CONTINUED )
12.
CONTINUED:

MOM
Les? Do you want to use my car
Saturday night?

Les sits down like he's playing musical chairs! The family
eats in silence. We hear another HONK, and then a couple of
quick HONKS, and then a HONNNKKK... The family tries to
ignore it, but it's more than annoying. It starts again:

EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - INSIDE A RUSTED TWO-DOOR 48 DATSUN B-
210 - NIGHT

Hanging over, from the back to the front seat, leaning on the
horn is Dean. Dean's MOM and his LITTLE SISTER ride in
front. They're used to this behavior.

BACK IN THE DINING ROOM

The obnoxious HONKING continues. Everyone except Les has
stopped eating. Cheery, he munches away as if nothing is
going on. Mom and Dad boil. Dad has had it.

DAD
Les, if you're not out of this
house in five seconds, there's a
good chance you'll never drive
anything but a golf ball.

A victorious Les calmly excuses himself from the table.

EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

Now this is a party. Loud music. Sixteen-year-old kids all
over the place. ALL THE GORGEOUS GIRLS AND GUYS huddle
around expensive SLICK DRIVING MACHINES, and competing car
stereos. If you happen to be a male without a car, you may
as well be at home with a Playboy.

The Datsun makes its way down the street.

INT. DEAN'S MOTHER'S DATSUN - NIGHT

An uncomfortable backseat, filled with junk. Les and Dean
sit squished together, practically eating their knees. The
front seat is pushed all the way back. Dean's little
munchkin sister sits comfortably in the passenger seat.

They approach the party. Dean's mom slows down. Embarrassed,
Dean and Les duck.

(CONTINUED )
13.
CONTINUED:

DEAN'S MOM
Is there something wrong with the
car, Dean?

DEAN
It's not the car, Ma. It's you,
you're driving. Just drop us off
around the corner.

EXT./INT. CAR - AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

As Dean and Les pull themselves out of the car, a GLOSSY
BLACK GTO, with a confederate flag attached to its antenna,
slows down across the street. Inside the GTO are THREE of
the scariest and rowdiest looking HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS you've
ever seen. They're laughing at the boys being dropped off by
mom.

THE DRIVER
Hey boys, does Mommy drive you to
the little boys' room, also?

Les and Dean are crushed. As the derelicts drive away
laughing, we hear their crazy horn. The Funeral March...
"DUM, DUM, DaDUM... DUM, DaDUM, DaDUM, DaDUM."

DEAN
(to his mother)
Sorry, I didn't introduce you, Ma.

She laughs.

DEAN

See you at twelve?
DEAN'S MOM

I'll be right here at eleven.
DEAN

I'll call.
DEAN'S MOM

It's a school night, Dean. If
you're not standing here between
eleven and eleven o' two, I'm
changing the locks.

The Datsun drives off. Composed, they strut around the

corner. Ahead of them, in front of the estate and all the
kids, a HONDA pulls up.

(CONTINUED )
14.
CONTINUED:

CHARLES

jumps out and WAVES GOOD-BYE TO HIS MOTHER. Older looking,
but by no means better looking than Les and Dean, he wears
glasses and isn't ashamed of being dropped off by his mother.
He waves to Dean and Les. They turn into the party, ignoring
him.

EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

Les, Dean, and Charles sip fruit punch. They sit alone on
the front steps gawking at the hoards of cute girls
surrounding the guys and their cars. Impressive, but
sickening.

DEAN

I know exactly what you're
thinking, Les. I'm thinking the
same thing. I'm not sure about
Charles.

(beat)
Why am I so alone here? I'm good
looking, I've got a great sense of
humor, and yet there's not one
single female within twenty yards
of me? Can you find one of them
who isn't within arms reach of a
car?

LES
They've even monopolized the
fifteen year olds.

CHARLES
You guys are pathetic. Life does
exist outside a V-Eight.

LES
Not in this country, it doesn't.

DEAN
And do you know what the beauty of
it all is? The beauty of it all,
Les, is that Saturday afternoon,
less than forty-eight hours away,
the people at the DMV are going to
be handing you your license... our

Les' eyes glitter. He's in a trance.

(CONTINUED )
15.
CONTINUED:

DEAN
You can say good-bye to the
humiliation of public
transportation, and not being able
to date someone who isn't
conveniently close to a bus stop.
You're going to be free, Les. One
of them.

(beat)

And on Saturday night, when we pull
into Archie's Atomic in your mom's
Audi 5000 TURBO, all this is going
to be at our fingertips. In fact,
Archie's makes this place look like
Sesame Street.

CHARLES
To you Archie's makes the Playboy
Channel look like Sesame Street.

DEAN

Archie's is the joint. I swear it.
My brother used to go there every
weekend. He says the ratio of
girls to guys is five to one. And
we're not talkin' dogs, we're
talkin' bunnies. The place is a
paradise.

(beat)
I'm telling you, Les. The secret
to your happiness, and ultimately
our happiness, as long as we live
in this country, is a driver's
license.

CHARLES
You can't possibly believe that
bullshit, can you?

DEAN
(leoking around at all the
cars, girls and
happiness)
Charles. Seeing is believing.

You gotta believe him.
16.

INT. ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Soft lighting. Kids sitting, standing, talking, necking.
Les, Dean, and Charles slump by the punch bowl observing the
decadence.

DEAN
Do you ever wonder what kind of car
would be most appropriate for some
of these wenches to lose their
virginity in?

CHARLES

You never cease to amaze me, Deano.
DEAN

Seriously. Look at Cheryl

Lieberman.
THE BOYS' P.O.V. - CHERYL LIEBERMAN
A sixteen-year-old JAP. They laugh.

CHARLES
A Camaro.

LES
Cheryl Lieberman? A Trans Am.

DEAN
Beth Maclaine.

BETH MACLAINE
Pristine. Conservative Anglo Saxon.

LES
A Volvo. Maybe a station wagon.

DEAN
Bonnie Dupa.

THE BOYS' P.O.V. - BONNIE DUPA

We CAN ONLY SEE her face as someone is sitting in front of
her. She's sleaze to the max.

CHARLES

(o.8.)
A van.

(CONTINUED )
17.
CONTINUED:

DEAN
(o.s.)
Nah, a Harley.

LES
(o.8.; reverent tone)
Mercedes.

DEAN AND CHARLES
(0.8.3; shocked)
A Mercedes?

THE BOYS

They turn to Les only to see him gaping, mouth open. Dean
and Charles look up and become entranced, as well.

THE BOYS' P.O.V. - A VISION - MERCEDES LANE

Standing, framed, in the doorway, backlit, the light shining
through her dress, exposing the silhouette of her long legs.
At seventeen she looks twenty. She's an untouchable.

THE BOYS

LES
(still reverent)
Mercedes Lane.

DEAN
What more can be said?

LES
I've bumped into her a million
times, and she's never once bumped
into me.

Mercedes heads for them, arguing with her older looking
boyfriend, PAOLO. He looks very out of place.

MERCEDES
You don't own me, I can do whatever
I like. Women have rights in this
country. Not like Chile or
Argentina, where they worship their
men.

They barge through the boys as if they were a string of

beads. Les "quivers" beside Mercedes as she pours herself
some punch.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

18.

PAOLO
It has nothing to do with worship,
it has to do with going to parties
with... with kids.

MERCEDES
I happen to go to school with these
kids. I have friends here.

PAOLO
Friends? These children can do
nothing for you.

MERCEDES
(cold)
Can we just stop this discussion?
There are some things you and I
will never agree on.

PAOLO
(flustered)
Mercedes. I'm beginning to
perspire. You know I hate to
perspire.
(turning to go)
Are you coming?

MERCEDES
I think I can find my own way home,
thank you.

He walks away.

MERCEDES
And Paolo? If you're wondering
about Saturday night, I just
remembered...

PAOLO
(turning back)
Don't do this to me, Mercedes.
You'll regret it.

MERCEDES
I've made other plans. I already
have a date.

PAOLO
With who?

MERCEDES
With him.

(CONTINUED )
19.
CONTINUED:

Mercedes turns to a shocked Les.

PAOLO
Him?
MERCEDES
(to Les)
Didn't we make arrangements?
LES
(hesitant)
I... I believe so. But, nothing
was final.
MERCEDES

Well now they're final.

PAOLO
You'll pay for this, Mercedes.

Paolo storms away. Les watches, afraid to speak. Mercedes
downs her punch. She fills her glass again, and downs it.
Les who? WE PUSH IN ON Les. He's in a daze.

EXT. SUNNY MEADOWS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Kids pile out of class.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

Dean and Charles get on the bus. Les stands on the curb.
The bus starts its engine. Fancy cars pull away.

DEAN
I cannot believe you, Les. You're
blowing the greatest night of your
life for a girl who probably
doesn't even know you have a pulse.

LES
Dean, believe it!

DEAN
(betrayed)
That's pathetic. After all these
years we finally get a chance to go
to Archie's, and now you're telling
me it's off?

(CONTINUED )
20.

CONTINUED:
LES
If Mercedes pulls through, you bet.
CHARLES
Why don't you just ask her, to make
sure?
LES

I'd love to Charles, but I can't
talk to something I can't see.
Last night was the closest any of
us have ever been to her.

DEAN
Well you're in luck, loverboy,
‘cause she's sittin' down right
behind you.

Dean backs away. The bus doors slam closed in Les' face. He
turns around:

Mercedes sits on a bench about twenty-five feet away, reading
an ELLE magazine, sipping some apple juice.

Les turns back to the bus. It's pulling away.

DEAN
(leaning out)
Go on, ask her. If you're lucky,
she'll bite.

Les turns back to Mercedes.

She's more beautiful than ever. He walks towards her. Her
blonde hair flutters in the wind. He stands beside her.
Some apple juice dribbles off her bottom lip. She tongues
her lips dry. It's the sexiest thing he's ever seen. He
can't even talk.

She glances up. Not recognizing him, she goes back to her
Magazine. We hear a LOUD HONK! HONK! !!!! It scares
Mercedes.

Les turns, shocked to see his father in the Cadillac, pulling
up in front of them. He HONKS again. It's the loudest horn
in the world. Les, embarrassed, ignores his father.

DAD

(rolling down the window)
Les?

(CONTINUED )
21.
CONTINUED:

The height of embarrassment. Les coolly walks by Mercedes.
Then, instead of getting into the car, he walks in front of
it, across the street. Dad rolls down the window, HONKING
again.

DAD
Les. It's me, your father.

Cringe. He tries to get out of her sight. Mercedes doesn't
even notice. Dad follows beside him, like the secret
service.

DAD
What's going on, here, Les? Don't
you recognize me?

Still no answer. He turns the corner. So does Dad.
Finally, out of her sight, Les gets in.

INT./EXT. CADILLAC - DAY

A WHITE INTERIOR, impeccably clean. The immensity of the car
dwarfs Les. We SEE BAGS OF PAMPERS in the back seat.

DAD
Is there something wrong with
having a father, these days?

LES
Dad, what are you doing here?

DAD
I ran some errands for your mom,
and I thought I'd come by and take
you driving. I figured if you could
handle this cruiser you could
handle anything.

LES
But what about Grandpa?

DAD
Don't worry about Grandpa. Who
knows what he's doing with my car?

LES
(excited)
Okay.

Dad slides over. Les climbs into the driver's seat, moving
it way up close.

(CONTINUED )
22.
CONTINUED:

He checks his mirrors then takes a deep breath. He puts his
flicker on, then pulls out, very slowly... cautiously.
Immediately, the car screeches to a halt fifteen feet before
a stop sign.

Dad rubs his neck.

LES
Sorry. The brakes are a little
sensitive.

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Les smoothly turns the Cadillac off a busy street into a
residential neighborhood.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT./INT. CADILLAC - DAY

Les, driving for a while now, begins to get the hang of it.
He stops smoothly at a stop sign. Suddenly, he stares wide-
eyed, frozen.

DAD
That's a long enough stop. Make a
right here.

LES
I can't.

DAD
What's the matter?

Up the block, Les sees Mercedes Lane.

LES
I have to ask you a favor. You can
say no, but I'll never ask you
another one as long as I live.

DAD
Les, you know that's a lie.

LES
You see that girl up ahead? Her
name is Mercedes Lane. To put it
simply, if she asked me to marry
her tomorrow, I'd definitely say
yes.

(CONTINUED )
23.
CONTINUED:

DAD
(excited)
So. Let's drive by her.

LES
Dad, she just asked me out last
night. If I drive by with you in
the car, she'll never look at me
again. Even if I were standing on
her chest.

DAD
You're asking me to let you drive
this car, alone? Without a
license? Are you insane?

LES
I'll just drive by, say hello and
circle back. It'll take two
minutes.

Dad, sizing up the situation, looks at Les, then at Mercedes
who walks farther up the block.

LES
(earnestly)
I just want to see if she was
serious.

DAD
(with a big heart)
Sure.
LES
And Dad...
(looking at groceries)
Would you mind?

What can Dad say? He gets out, with the Pampers, then
watches Les pull away.

LES' P.O.V. - APPROACHING MERCEDES

He rolls down the window and honks. She turns, gives hima
dirty look, and keeps walking. He shadows her.

LES
Mercedes?

She stops and looks inside, puzzled.

(CONTINUED )
24.

CONTINUED:
LES
Les Anderson, from the party last
night.
MERCEDES

Oh, you scared me. I didn't
recognize you. Some jerk honked at
me a little while ago in a car just
like this.

LES
You live around here, don't you?

MERCEDES
Unh, unh. Just up the street.

LES
Hop in, I'll give you a lift?

MERCEDES
Sure, that'd be fun.

As she's about to open the front door:

LES
Wait a second.

Les jumps out of the car, runs around the passenger side, and
insists she get in the back seat. Charmed, she does.

DAD
down the road, shakes his head in
disbelief.
INT. CAR - DAY
Adjusting the rearview mirror, Les momentarily holds on her
chest, then up to her face. He smiles. He sees Dad, in the

mirror, holding the bags.

LES
Which house is yours?

MERCEDES
It's right down the block.

He drives up half a block.

(CONTINUED )
25.
CONTINUED:

LES
(about to pull into the
driveway)
Okaaayyy-

MERCEDES
But... I'm not going home.

LES
(stunned)
Where are you going?
MERCEDES
Into Cedarbrook, to a friend's
place. You don't mind, do you?

Les is stunned, caught completely off guard. He looks at
his:

REARVIEW MIRROR
His father, still holding the bags, stands alone.
LES
(weakly)
No, not at all.
EXT. STREETS - DAY
Dad, with the bags beside him on the sidewalk, is livid.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CEDARBROOK ESTATE - LATER

Mercedes walks away from the Cadillac.

LES
(calling out)
Mercedes?
MERCEDES
(coming back)
Unh, unh.

(CONTINUED )
26.
CONTINUED:

LES
(courageous)
Last night at the party, you
mentioned something about you and I
going out Saturday night. I was
just curious... Are we still on?

She doesn't have the heart.

MERCEDES
Sure... Call me, tomorrow.
LES

(pulling out a pen)
Great, let me give you my number in
case something comes up. You never
know.

MERCEDES
(handing him her Elle
Magazine)
Here, write it on this.

He excitedly writes his number on the front cover, then hands
it back to her.

MERCEDES
Thanks again for the lift, Les.

LES
No problem.

INT./EXT. CADILLAC - LATER

Les coasts down the street like a cop on surveillance.
Suddenly, he spots Dad a block ahead, carrying the huge
grocery bags. His jacket is off and his shirt is soaked in
sweat.

As Les pulls up, Dad glares at him. If looks could kill.

INT. LIVING ROOM AND DEN - DAY

Les sits stiffly, in a chair. Dad disheveled, his shirt
soaked with sweat, circles Les like a shark.

DAD
(angry)
How could you do it, Les?
(MORE )

(CONTINUED )
27.

CONTINUED:
DAD (cont'd)
You gave me your word and you used
up your last favor? Do you realize
where this leaves you?

LES

Not in good shape, but just let me
explain. I admit I should never
have let her in the car, but she
lived three houses down. I thought
I was taking her home.

(leoking at Mom)
Mom, I'm sure there were many
similar romantic gestures when Dad
was dating you.

Mom lies on her side in the den wearing a workout outfit,
doing scissor-kick exercises, to a pregnancy video. If Moby
Dick were a pregnant woman living in America, she'd look like
this.

MOM
(thinking)
I don't know. There must have
been. We're married.

Mom smiles. Dad looks at her as if to say, "Thanks a lot."

DAD
Why didn't you just tell her the
truth?

LES

Tell Mercedes Lane I don't have a
license? And risk her having a
heart attack from laughing so hard?
Put yourself in my shoes.

Dad looks at Les. Then to Mom for help. Forget it, Dad,
you're on your own.

DAD
(giving in)
Well, consider yourself lucky that
I didn't have a heart attack
walking home.

INT. LES' ROOM - NIGHT
Stereo, TV, CD, boyhood Americana. Posters of cars cover the
walls. We faintly hear classical music seeping through the

walls. The boys are over. While Les cuts Mercedes' picture
out of the high school yearbook, Dean gives him a hard time.

(CONTINUED )
28.
CONTINUED:

DEAN
Do you know what happens if you get
caught driving without a license?
They make you wait two years before
you can take the test again. Two
years, Les. Twenty-four months.
That's a lot of bus rides.

LES

Relax, I didn't get caught.

(pinning the picture over

his desk)
And you'd do the same.

(beat)
Now did you guys come over to ask
me some questions? Because if you
didn't, then I have some studying
to do.

A tense silence. Les hands Charles the Driver's Ed book.
Through the walls, the classical music builds in intensity.

CHARLES
All right. How can you identify a
blind pedestrian to whom you must
yield the right of way?

DEAN
You're not serious.

LES
By their white cane, or guard dog.

DEAN

This is a complete waste of time.
You know your stuff, Les. You've
been a passenger in a car for
sixteen years. It's not like
you're from Bedrock or something.
You've lived and breathed this
theory bullshit.

The music booms through the walls, building to a crescendo.
DEAN

(disturbed by the music)
What is that shit?
29.

INT. NATALIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Tchaikovsky!!! Bookish Natalie sits at her desk studying her
Driver's Ed manual, taking notes, trying to memorize. As she
studies, her body responds to the music with great intensity.
And then relaxes when the music becomes quiet... Suddenly,
from an INTERCOM above her desk, we hear Dean's obnoxious
voice.

DEAN

(voice over)
Hey, Naaaatalie! If you were ina
car traveling at the speed of fifty-
five miles per hour, and you
collided with a runaway train,
would that create any improvements
in your face?

Her pencil snaps. A total disruption of concentration.
Silence. And now we hear the loudest and most disgusting
BURP of all time. And then wails of laughter... And then
Dean, again.

DEAN
(voice over)
Good luck on your exam tomorrow,
Einstein!

INT. D.M.V. TESTING ROOM DAY

A SEA OF APPLICANTS, mostly kids, some older. They sit in
front of their computer screens and keyboards, ready to
begin. Les and Natalie sit beside each other. MISS HELLMAN,
an older BLUE-HAIRED WOMAN stands at the front of the room.

MISS HELLMAN
Good afternoon, children. In the
next fifteen minutes you will be
given thirty questions. Any more
than five mistakes will be
considered a failing grade. We'll
begin at the sound of the bell.

She looks up at the clock, a second away from one o'clock.
The bell RINGS. The students begin. Les is off:

(CONTINUED )
30.
CONTINUED:

LES' P.O.V. - THE SCREEN

Question #1. What should you do if you miss your exit from
an expressway? A-Jam on the breaks and back up. B-Make a
quick U-turn. C-Go on to the next one.

LES CHUCKLES TO HIMSELF
He taps C. Correct. One for one.

Question #2. The screen shows a stretch of freeway with
three lanes, marked A, B, C. (C being the right lane)
"Which is usually the smoothest lane of traffic? A, B, or
c."

LES
(to himself)
Why don't they just give licenses
away?

He presses C. WRONG.

LES
(shocked)
What?

He looks over at Natalie. She's just tapping away and
smiling. He looks back at his screen. The next question.

He looks at it and looks at it. He decides. He winces.
Wrong again. Beads of sweat begin to gather on his forehead.

AROUND THE ROOM - NERVOUS STUDENTS' HANDS.

1. A GIRL'S bangled hand plays with her hair.

2. A GUY nervously bites his nails.

3. A GIRL'S jappy fingernails clack away on the desk.
4. A DUMB JOCK cracks his knuckles.

LES

scratches his scalp, and taps his foot nervously. He looks
around, takes a deep breath, presses a key, then waits for a
response. A sigh of relief. Natalie cooks.

NATALIE'S P.O.V. - HER SCREEN

Question number 24. What actions should you take if another
vehicle passes you on the left? A-Speed up and don't let him

in. B-Take down his license number. C-Slow down. She
presses C. Correct. 24 for 24.

(CONTINUED )
31.
CONTINUED:

LES AND NATALIE
A picture of opposites. Natalie, effervescent, full of life.
Les, a wreck. We see in his face that it's coming down to

the wire.

LES'S SCREEN

It reads: WARNING!!! ONE MORE INCORRECT ANSWER AND YOU
FAIL!!
NATALIE
(o.8.)
Finished.

Natalie bounces past him. She's all smiles. He hates her.
BACK AT THE SCREEN

Question number 26. At 55 m.p.h. you come upon a large
puddle of water. Do you A-pump your brakes. B-gently ease
your foot off the gas pedal. C-Accelerate. Les' finger goes
from A to B and then to the side. He pauses toiling. He
presses A. WRONG! You have failed.

His hands begin to shake. His eyes freeze on the screen.
It's the end of the world. Out of frustration he:

WHACKS THE COMPUTER

with both hands on either side. The screen blips off and
stays off. He looks up and around. All the students in his
row have their hands up. What has he done?

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Les, nervously, waits at a counter with a crowd of people.
Miss Hellman returns.

MISS HELLMAN
Mr. Anderson, you'll have to thank
your sister for this one.

LES
What do you mean?

MISS HELLMAN
At the present moment, the
Department of Motor Vehicles'
computers are down, so we can't get
your test results.

(MORE )

(CONTINUED )
32.
CONTINUED:

MISS HELLMAN (cont'd)
However, considering your sister
received a perfect score, we're
going to pass you, and allow you to
take your road test.

(beat)

How different can you and your twin
sister actually be?

Les smiles. His lips crack, he's so happy.

EXT. LES' ROAD TEST CAR - DAY
Cheery and full of life, Les opens the door and peers in.
INSIDE THE CAR

sits MR. KELLY. Hair slicked back, wearing dark aviator
sunglasses, he's the-sickest, most maligned, frightening-
lecking human being you've ever seen. Les' stomach drops.

INT. NATALIE'S CAR - DAY

A stick shift. A typical road test car. A little nervous,
she doesn't seem to have the grit she usually has. She's
having trouble adjusting her seatbelt. MR. NICE GUY, her laid-
back driving instructor, observes and looks over his
checklist.

MR. NICE GUY
Let me help you with that.

NATALIE
I think I can get it.

She struggles. He leans over, mashing his body up against
hers, fixing the belt and holding it for a few Mississippis
too long.

NATALIE
Thanks.

MR. NICE GUY
There's nothing to be nervous
about, Natalie. You'll have your
license before you know it. Take
your time.

(CONTINUED )
33.
CONTINUED:

INSIDE LES' CAR

Les, anxious to roll, listens to some last minute warnings
from Mr. Kelly. A full steaming cup of coffee sits on the
dash.

MR. KELLY

Anderson. I want you to take a long
hard look at that cup of coffee.
Now I love my coffee. It may be
the only thing I truly cherish on
this god forsaken mudball we call
earth. What I'm trying to say is
that most inspectors use a
checklist.

(holding up the clipboard)
I don't believe in them.

(he throws it out the

window)
What I do believe in, is my cup of
coffee. You see, that coffee is
hot, filled right to the brim. If
it spills on me it'll probably burn
me. And no one likes to get
burned. So, if you burn me, you
fail. If you don't, you pass.
It's as simple as that.

(beat)
Whenever you're ready.

INSIDE NATALIE'S CAR

Natalie puts her flicker on, checks her blind spot, then
pulls out in first gear. A very ROCKY, JERKY, start.

NATALIE
I'm sorry.

MR. NICE GUY

No need to apologize, it happens to

everyone.
INSIDE LES' CAR
He gently slips the car into gear, balancing the clutch and
the gas like James Bond diffusing a bomb. He perspires. One
eye on the road the other on the cup. As he pulls away:
THE COFFEE

swishes, just barely hitting the rim. He's made it. Kelly
takes a sip, and then puts it back.
34.

EXT. D.M.V.

WE CRANE UP ABOVE THE LOT as Les' car follows Natalie's car
out of the lot.

MR. KELLY
(o.s., drill sergeant)
Make a left at the intersection,
Anderson.
MR. NICE GUY
(o.s., imitating the Pope)
Natalie, can you please make a
right at the corner.
Les' car, cutting across traffic, makes a left into the
hectic city. Natalie's car makes a right into quiet
suburbia.
EXT. QUIET HILLY SIDE STREET - DAY

Natalie's car runs smoothly down a residential street.

EXT. NOISY MAIN STREET - DAY

Les' car is in the thick of Saturday morning traffic. An
AMBULANCE is behind them, siren wailing!

AMUBLANCE
MOVE TO THE RIGHT! EMERGENCY!
MOVE TO THE RIGHT!
EXT./INT. NATALIE'S CAR - DAY

A ritzy quiet neighborhood. The car is set on a small hill,
more like a bump. Inside the car, an air of tranquility.

MR. NICE GUY
Let's see how you can handle the
clutch on a hill.

It's a joke. Smoother than smooth.
EXT./INT. LES' CAR - DAY

In traffic, at the top of what most skiers consider the PEAK.
An ANTIQUE CAR pulls within three inches of his back bumper.

(CONTINUED )
35.
CONTINUED:

Les checks his rearview mirror.
LES' P.O.V. - THE ANTIQUE CAR

practically in his trunk. The coffee angles against the cup,
a hair away from the rim.

The light turns green. The guy HONKS. The coffee vibrates.
Droplets of sweat appear on his forehead. He releases the
clutch and smocthly pulls away. The cup is fine.
INT. NATALIE'S CAR - DAY
Not a moving car in sight. Birds chirp. All is well.
MR. NICE GUY

Stop just up ahead of this car on

the right. I 'd like you to

parallel park.
Natalie stops, signals right, then shifts into reverse. The
spot is big enough to park a 747. She handles it easily.
EXT. HECTIC TWO WAY TRAFFIC - DAY
Les, stopped, has his right flicker on. Traffic backs up
behind him. He's to parallel park in a spot a stroller would
have trouble fitting in. He does a textbook parking job.

INT. D.M.V. PICTURE ROOM - LATER

Natalie. Her typical sour expression. The flash pops.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
Natalie, at a bureau counter, waits for her license.

ATTENDANT
Congratulations. Drive safely.

NATALIE
Thank you.
36.

EXT. D.M.V. - DAY

Natalie walks through the parking lot on her way home. We
SEE Les, across the street, his left flicker on, waiting for
a gap in the traffic.

EXT. D. M. V. PARKING LOT - DAY

As Natalie walks out of the parking lot, on her way home, Les
pulls in.

We FOLLOW Les' car as he's about to park.

INT/EXT. LES' CAR

The coffee cup balances on the dash. Les is home free. BUT,
SUDDENLY, A GIRL runs out in front of the car waving her new
license at a friend.

GIRL
I got it. I got it.

Les JAMS ON THE BRAKES to avoid hitting her.
THE CUP ON THE DASH FLIES INTO KELLY'S LAP. Les looks at
Kelly, pleading, afraid. Kelly calmly picks the cup up then
turns it over.
MR. KELLY

You're in luck, Anderson. The cup

was empty. See you on the

battlefield sometime.

Les, grateful, would love to hug Mr. Kelly.

INT. PICTURE ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON LES, a million dollar smile. The camera flashes.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Les, exploding with anticipation, waits in line to pick up
his license. The Attendant signals him.

He looks at it: The Holy Grail, The Ark of The Covenant. He

can't walk. As he's about to step away, the attendant stops
him.

(CONTINUED )
37.
CONTINUED:

ATTENDANT
(looking at a list)
Mr. Anderson. Hold on, one second.
Someone wants to speak with you.

Holding his license, he watches as the attendant, with list,
walks over to Miss Hellman. His heart skips a beat.

Large beads of perspiration. Miss Hellman walks toward him.
BOOM-BOOM, BOOM-BOOM, goes his heart. His future passes
before him. We hear voices in DEEP REVERB.

DAD
(voice over)
Just pass your driver's exam, and
then we'll talk.

MERCEDES
(voice over)
Sure. Call me

CHARLES
(voice over)
Life does exist outside a V-8.

DEAN
(voice over)
You're going to be free, Les. One
of them... one of them... one of
them.

MISS HELLMAN
Well, well, Mr. Anderson. Mr.
Anderson.

Les snaps out of it.
LES
(squeaking)
Yes?
INSERT - TEST PRINTOUT ON PRINTER
MISS HELLMAN AND HER VICIOUS SMILE
His eyes begin to water.
MISS HELLMAN
We were able to retrieve your test
results from the computer, Mr.
Anderson. And, as I suppose you

already know, you failed.

results with one hand)
God giveth...
(taking the license with
the other)

with the Department of Motor
Vehicles!

As she rips up his license, the IMAGE BLURS.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

Devastated. Walking sluggishly, staring at his failed exam.
It's the end of the world. He crams the test in back pocket.
The edge of it sticks out.

A convertible VW Rabbit whips by, music blaring. Sixteen
year old girls and guys rock to the music. Probably the
happiest day of their lives.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

Les enters. The house is quiet. There's no one home. Head
down, he treks upstairs to his room.

INT. LES' ROOM - LES - DAY

deeply depressed, walks into his room. His door is plastered
with telephone messages, all from Charles and Dean; "Pick me
up." "Congratulations, you made it." ...Deeper depression.

On his desk, a GIFT WRAPPED BOX. There's a card on top. It
reads, "Good Driving. Love, Mom and Dad." He tears the
wrapping off and looks in. He pulls out a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP!
Even deeper depression.

Dazed, he stares at Mercedes’ picture. She never looked
better. He never looked worse. We hear someone come into
the house.

MOM AND DAD
(o.8.)
Hellooocccoo. Helloocoooocce...
We're home.

Horror. He has to face his parents.
39.

INT. BABY ROOM - DAY

A newly decorated baby room. Moby Mom and Dad remove a CRIB
from a box. Les slouched over, walks in.

DAD
Hey, sport. What's the good news?

LES
(dejected)
Mom, Dad, I have something to tell
you.

DAD
(playing)
You already dented the car.

MOM
What is it?

Mom and Dad look at him, eagerly. Les looks them in the eye.
What's he gonna do??? Could this be it???

Suddenly, his frown becomes the biggest smile. He locks
genuinely excited. He starts to sing and dance around the
room.

LES
(to the tune of Soul Man)
I'm a free man. Dodo, dodo, dodo,
dodo. I'ma free man, yaaahhh.

MOM
Congratulations.

LES
Thank youuuuuuuuu...

DAD
Was it a breeze?

LES
Like taking candy from a baby.

DAD
(laughing)
I filled mom's car up this
afternoon, if you feel like taking
it for a drive.

(CONTINUED )
40.
CONTINUED:

LES
(stopped in his tracks)
No thanks, Dad. I think I'm gonna
go to my room and lie down. I'm
exhausted.

Mom and Dad are puzzled.

MOM
Is there something wrong, Les?

LES
Wrong? Are you kidding me? This
is the greatest day of my life.
Sixteen-years-old with a license in
my wallet. I couldn't ask for
more.

MOM
So why don't you want to take the
car for a drive and celebrate a
little, get it out of your system?

LES
I don't know if you guys
remember... sixteen years of
waiting and dreaming is a lot of
pressure. It's a very powerful
moment, and I'm not sure sitting
behind the wheel is the place for
me to be right now.

MOM
Can we at least see your license?

LES
Mom, the picture is so ugly, I'm
even afraid to look at it. It
smells.

DAD
We're your parents, Les. We
changed your diapers, remember?
I'm quite sure we could handle it.

LES
(leaving the room)
Sorry, Dad. It's worse than dirty
diapers.

(CONTINUED )
41.
CONTINUED:

DAD
(to Mom)
How can anything be worse than
dirty diapers?

INT. HOUSE STAIRWAY - DAY

Les realizes what he just backed himself into, and he kind of
likes it. Rudy comes barging in the front door, excited as
hell, looking for his brother. Les is in full stride...

Rudy runs to him and slaps him "high five."

RUDY
Awwrighhhhht.
(beat)
When can we go for a drive?

LES
Later, later. Let me just make a
few phone calls.

Rudy buys it, another one sold. The phone rings. Les picks
it up.

INT. LES' BEDROOM - DAY

Les dances in, whistling, he's a new man. He opens his phone
book and turns to the name "Mercedes," beside a Mercedes Benz
symbol. He dials the number and waits... it's BUSY. Just as
he puts it down, it RINGS. He picks it up.

INT. DEAN'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAY

Tiny. Water pipes abound. A pigsty a pig wouldn't live in.
Dean holds the telephone up to the speaker. Charles hits
play on the tape deck and suddenly the sounds of A ROCK
CONCERT CROWD CHEERING AND SCREAMING blasts out of the
speakers. Intercut Les and Dean.

Les listens... He loves it. It finally fades out.

DEAN
You're the king, Les. You did it,
man. How does it feel?

LES
Deano baby! Hang on a second, I'm
looking for my keys. Wait!

They laugh. Another one sold.

INT. SHOWER - NIGHT

Les is in seventh heaven, singing and whistling.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

Mom flicks on the washer, then leaves the room with an empty
laundry basket balancing on her stomach.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Mom pokes her head in, while Les is still in the shower. She
grabs his dirty underwear, socks and jeans. As she plops
them into her basket, we SEE the corner of Les' test results
edging out of his back pocket.

Les turns the shower off. Dad pops his head into the
bathroom.

DAD
I wanna see you in the den in a few
minutes, chief.

LES
(on top of the world)
I'm there.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

Standing by the washer Mom empties everyone's pockets; Dad's,
Rudy's, Les' jeans... Without realizing what it is, she
places Les' failed exam on the counter. As it sits there it
partially unfolds. Mom loads the washer.

INT. DEN —- NIGHT

Dad sits with Natalie, waiting for Les. Behind Dad, Rudy
sits in front of a GIANT SCREEN TV, with the sound off. He's
watching "THE FRENCH CONNECTION."

DAD
(frustrated)
Where's Les?
43.

INT. LES' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wearing a bathrobe, he's on the phone. Still busy.
Confused, he leaves the room.

INT. MERCEDES' ROOM - NIGHT
Outfits scattered about. Mercedes is on the phone.

GIRL
(voice over)
Mercedes, you could have any guy
you'd like. Forget Paolo. He's
old enough to be your mother's
younger brother.

MERCEDES
But why hasn't he called? He's
going to the club tonight, I know
it.

INT. DEN - NIGHT

Les, full of life, sits beside Natalie. As Dad talks, the
famous chase scene from "THE FRENCH CONNECTION" unfolds.

DAD
With Mom expecting any day now,
it's extremely important that there
is always one car at home. I
cannot make that any clearer. Am I

understood?
NATALIE
(sour)
Yes.
LES
Absolutely, hundred percent. Is
that all?
DAD
Les... We don't want Mom going into

labor without a car here to drive
her to the hospital. Taxis are
unreliable, and you both know how
slow buses can be. If I'm out, one
of you must be here.

(CONTINUED )
44,

DAD (cont'd)
The same goes for me when the both
of you are out. The overriding
consideration now is your mother.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - EARLY EVENING

As Mom sorts the laundry, she watches TV: A "Pregnancy
Period" home video guide. A WOMAN speaks. Beside Mom,
resting on top of Les' still partially-folded test, is a bowl
of PICKLED PIG'S FEET with CHOCOLATE SYRUP on it.

WOMAN

(on TV)
++eas long as you aren't
experiencing any dizzy spells, and
as long as you can still fit behind
the wheel, you can safely drive
short distances up to delivery day.
Don't, however, try to drive
yourself to the hospital while in
labor.

INT. DEN NIGHT

Dad continues. In the chase scene, behind him, Popeye Doyle
swerves away, avoiding a baby in a stroller.

DAD
Now, I've put together a list of
the rules of the road that I think
we should go over.

Dad pulls out some NOTES and hands a copy to Les and Natalie.

LES
Dad...

DAD
This way you'll never be able to
say you don't remember hearing
them. Take a minute to look them
over. They may end up saving your
life.

They flip through them. They can't believe it.

INT. LES' ROOM — NIGHT

Les walks into his room and without giving it a thought
pitches Dad's rules and regulations into the garbage can.
45.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

While gathering everyone's loose change and pocket contents,
Mom notices Les' test results. She unfolds the test sheet.
It's obvious he failed!

INT. LES' ROOM - CLOSE ON A TAPE DECK - NIGHT

Rock and roll. A tape records. Needles bounce. "MERCEDES
FAST" is scrawled on the label. PULL BACK... We SEE Rudy
wearing the chauffeur's cap, standing by the rockin' stereo.
Les dials the phone. It's ringing, finally. He signals Rudy
to turn it down. Silence. Joy on Les' face.

MERCEDES
(voice over; sexy)
Hello...

Suddenlytittttrriritt
THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN

The boys look up. It's Dad, carrying a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
and TWO GLASSES. Les, receiver in hand, is stunned. He
can't talk with his Dad in the room. As he hangs up the
phone, WE HEAR:

MERCEDES
(on the phone)
Paolo? Is that you?

DAD
Rudy. Go downstairs. Les, my boy,
we're drinking a toast to you.

Rudy exits.

LES
Dad, that's very thoughtful of you,
but you know I shouldn't be
drinking and driving.

DAD
(popping open the bottle)
Les. You just saved me $26,000.

LES
How did I do that?

(CONTINUED )
46.
CONTINUED:

DAD
(pouring him a glass)
First raise your glass.
(toasting)
To saving me 26,000 buckaroonies.

LES
(taking a sip)
I don't get it.

DAD
Twenty-three thousand for the BMW,
and three thousand for the
insurance.

LES
(excited)
How did I do that?
Dad whips out the test.

DAD
With this.

Les is shattered.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
Mom has just told Rudy and Natalie about Les.

RUDY AND NATALIE
He failed?iiitit

INT. LES' ROOM - NIGHT (SAME LOCATION - DIFFERENT DIALOGUE)
Les sits on his bed, head down. Dad kneels in front of him.

DAD
Les, did it ever occur to you that
you could've told your mom and me.
We're your parents, not the police.

LES
(ashamed)
I just figured that I could get
through the weekend and take the
test over Monday.

DAD
I know what you figured...

(CONTINUED )
47.
CONTINUED:

Les looks out into nowhere land.

DAD
Come on, Les. It's not the end of
the world.

LES
It feels like it.

DAD
(putting his arm around
Les)
You'll recover. The great ones
always do.

The doorbell rings.

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

Mom opens the door. It's KARL, Natalie's boyfriend. Workers
of the world unite!!! He wears HORN-RIMMED GLASSES.

KARL
Good evening, Mrs. Anderson. Is
Natascha home?

MOM
She'll be down in a second.

KARL
How are you feeling?

MOM
Fine, Karl. Thank you.

KARL
I admire you for having the courage
to bring a child into this
oppressive world.

MOM
(calling for help)
NATALIEEEEE...

INT. LES' ROOM NIGHT

On his bed, staring at the ceiling. PAN TO the clock OVER
his bed. It reads 8:50.
48.

EXT./INT. KARL'S BEAT-UP CITROEN - NIGHT

Pulling out of the Anderson driveway. It huffs and it puffs
and it BACKFIRES. It sounds like shit!!

NATALIE
Are you sure you don't want to take
my mother's Audi? This car's never
going to make it to the rally.

KARL
(proud)
Natascha, don't let this old
warrior's heartbeat deceive you.
It has more than a lifetime worth
of travel left in it.

INT. MERCEDES' ROOM - NIGHT

Mercedes lies on the floor, beside the phone, with her feet
up on a chair. She looks sad and very alone. She rolls over
and grabs the ELLE magazine off of her bed. Leafing through
it, something on the front cover catches her eye... Les'
number.

INT. LES' ROOM - THE CLOCK - IT NOW READS 11:15 - NIGHT

PAN BACK TO Les in the same position. He hasn't moved. The
phone rings, and rings, and rings. He picks it up. Intercut

LES
(picking it up)
Hello.

MERCEDES
Is Les Anderson in, please?

LES
(confused)
This is Les.
MERCEDES
Les? This is Mercedes Lane. Do
you remember me?

This can't be.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

49.

LES
(trying to be cool)
Remember you?... Ah... I'm not
sure. Of course, Mercedes. How
are you?
MERCEDES

A little lonely, actually.

Les' eyes pop out.

He cringes

MERCEDES
I thought we had a date this
evening. I figured I'd call you,
since you hadn't called yet.

LES
I'm sorry. Actually, I just got
in. I was out... deep sea fishing

all day.
at the sound of his feeble lie.
MERCEDES

You haven't changed your mind about
tonight, have you?

LES
Tonight? Now? No.
MERCEDES
So you can pick me up in twenty

minutes?

(no response)
He looks at the clock and sees the
time.

LES
Hang on.

Les puts the phone down and looks out his window at Mom’s

AUDI 5000

parked in the driveway. He bolts out of the room.

INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Les gently opens their door and peers in. The TV is on. Mom
and Dad are asleep. The keys to the Audi are on the night
table beside Dad. He closes the door and takes a deep

breath.

(CONTINUED )
50.
CONTINUED:

LES
(to himself)
An innocent girl, a harmless drive.
What could possibly go wrong?

BACK IN HIS ROOM
He slides in and picks up the phone.

LES
(with confidence)
Mercedes? I'll be there in half an
hour.

MERCEDES
Great. And Les?... Can you bring
some liquor?

LES
(unbelieving)
Liquor? You mean alcohol?

A long pause.

MERCEDES
Les?

LES
Unh, unh.

MERCEDES

Vodka makes me crazy.

He must be dreaming.

INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - LES - NIGHT

tiptoes to Dad's night table. Les reaches for the keys, but
just as he's about to snatch them, Dad rolls over, stretching
out, plopping his hand down on top of them. It's no use.

Les walks out, turning the TV up even louder.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
Les searches the drawers of a desk. He pulls out a box of

spare keys... nothing. He checks other drawers... nothing.
He doesn't know what to do... or does he?
51.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Les walks-in and takes a long hard look at the Cadillac.
It's radiant. He looks in and sees the keys in the ignition.

LES
(to himself)

Anderson, you should be castrated.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A locked liquor cabinet. Les feels around back and pulls out
a SMALL MAGNETIC TIN BOX. A HIDE-A-KEY. He opens the
cabinet and pulls out a full bottle of vodka.
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
Les walks into the garage, carrying a cooler and a flask. He
lays them down beside the trunk. As he opens the car door,
the CAR ALARM sounds. It's LOUD AS HELL! He lunges into the
car and turns it off. He listens for his parents.

INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

They're still asleep.

EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT
The garage door inches up.
INSIDE THE CAR

He turns the ignition part way, unlocking the steering, then
shifts the car into neutral. The car doesn't budge.

He gets out of the car and begins to push it. It starts
to... ROLL SLOWLY, then pick up speed. He shuffles
alongside, trying to open the door. It rolls onto the FRONT
LAWN, headed straight for the SIX-FOOT-HIGH PERFECTLY-
MANICURED FRONT HEDGES.

Les holds his breath as the Cadillac plows through Picasso's
hedges, onto the street, thumping to a stop against the curb.

Les can't believe his eyes: the seven foot gap in the hedges,

and tire tracks in the lawn. As best he can, he props the
bushes up, and stomps on the tire tracks. He runs to:

(CONTINUED )
52.
CONTINUED:

THE GARAGE

where he unscrews the light bulbs and hits the automatic door
control. He runs back to the Caddie.

As he pulls away in one direction:
THE CITROEN - BANGING AND POPPING
on its last leg, pulls into THE DRIVEWAY from the other.

NATALIE
If you're not convinced this car's
about to die, maybe we should wait
until it catches fire and cremates
itself.

KARL
Need you be so cruel, Natascha.

NATALIE
(rolling her eyes)
Let me just get the keys to my
mother's Audi.

She walks into the house. A defeated Karl waits.

INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dad and Mom are fast asleep, wrapped in covers. Natalie
searches for the keys. She finally spots them under Dad's
hand. Unlike Les, she picks up Dad's hand, and removes the
Audi key.

Dad wakes up and looks at her. She holds out the key. He
smiles and falls back to sleep.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

EMPTY! No Cadillac. We hear the Audi start up and pull
away. No cars at home!!

INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

As we hear the car drive away. Pregnant Mom bolts in pain,

grabbing her stomach. She turns on the light and waits for
the pain to subside. She's okay. She turns the light off.
53.

EXT. MERCEDES' FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Les rings and waits. Mercedes opens the door. She looks
stunning.

LES
You look great.

MERCEDES
Thanks, Les. You look cute.

He smiles. Where's the nearest justice of the peace?

INT. CADDIE - NIGHT

Les' tape is a hit. Loud. Heaven. Mercedes is having a
great time.

LES

So where do you feel like going?
MERCEDES

I know the perfect place. You'll

love it.

Mercedes cranks the volume even louder. As she does, a COP
CAR squeezes by the Caddie giving Les a hard look. For the
first time, we see in Les' face the fear of what he's about
to get himself into.

EXT. EL RAY'S - NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A popular nightclub set in an UNSAFE NEIGHBORHOOD. The
Caddie is on a line for valet parking.

INSIDE THE CADILLAC

A ton of decibels. Mercedes sips on the flask, rocking to
the music. A neurotic Les watches the PARKERS manhandle the
cars ahead of him. Cars fishtail, leaving a cloud of blue
smoke.

The VALET reaches for Les' door. Les hits the automatic lock
switch.

MERCEDES
Open the door, Les.

(CONTINUED )
54a.
CONTINUED:

LES
I can't.

MERCEDES
What do you mean, you can't?

LES
(pulling out)
They'll destroy the gears. If I
let them touch this car, they'll
turn it into a manual transmission.
I'll park it myself.

EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

An alley lined with cars with smashed windows and missing
bumpers. Les backs into the only remotely safe-looking spot.
The Caddie lights shut off. We hear a SHRIEK. A GUNSHOT.
BROKEN GLASS! The Caddie lights turn back on. The car peels
out.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

They drive by the club, again, still looking, but now they're
on the other side of the street.

 

MERCEDES
(pointing to a spot)
There's one.

Les looks. It's perfect. Huge under a street lamp. He
pulls in.

LES
(noticing a parking sign)
I can't park here.

MERCEDES
Why not?

LES
It's a tow zone.

MERCEDES
On a Saturday night? Les, nobody
tows cars on a weekend. Look at
all the cars behind us. You think
they're worried?

Les is.

(CONTINUED )
55.
CONTINUED:

MERCEDES
(Cont'd)
Relax. You're acting like it's the
first time you've ever driven.

She struck a nerve. She gets out.

EXT. EL RAY'S ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Les follows Mercedes as she approaches the LARGE CROWD of
people waiting to get in. The DOORMAN recognizes Mercedes,
waves her in, but stops Les dead in his tracks.

LES
Hey, come on, I'm with her.

DOORMAN
(snobbish)
Riiiiight. You wouldn't be with
her if she were your Siamese twin.
Now, run on before someone steals
your tricycle, Mikie.

Forget it, Les.

INT. EL RAY'S - BAR/FOYER NIGHT

Before Mercedes realizes Les isn't with her, she spots PAOLO.
To get up her nerve, Mercedes grabs some GUY's glass of
champagne off the bar, and downs it. The guy looks on,
confused. Mercedes is a tad flushed. This may have been her
first drink.

She approaches Paolo. He sees her.

PAOLO
(feigned charm)
Mercedes, what a lovely surprise.
Where is your high school 'throb
heart?

Mercedes realizes Les isn't there. A beautiful SEXY WOMAN
slithers up beside Paolo, and nibbles on his ear. Mercedes
is repulsed.

OUTSIDE EL RAY'S

Les, unable to weasel by the Doorman, hustles up to a window
where he watches MERCEDES confront Paolo.

(CONTINUED )
56.
CONTINUED:

Behind him, at the Caddie, we see a TOW TRUCK attaching its
clamps and clips to the Cadillac's frame.

BACK INSIDE EL RAY'S FOYER
Mercedes is very upset.

PAOLO
(pouring champagne)
Please, Mercedes. Sit down and
join us for something to drink.

MERCEDES
No thanks, but here's something to
go with it.

OUTSIDE EL RAY'S
LES

watches Mercedes wind up and slap Paolo. Les smirks, as
Paolo stands stunned.

INSIDE EL RAY’S

Mercedes storms away. On the way out of the club, she grabs
the guy's MAGNUM OF CHAMPAGNE from the bucket of ice.

OUTSIDE EL RAY'S

Les waits for Mercedes. She stomps by him, back to the car,
swigging the near-full bottle of champagne. Les turns to
see...

THE TOW TRUCK, about to pull away with the Caddie. Blindly,
Les, runs across the street. Cars screech and swerve. He
stands in front of the truck. The DRIVER is an overweight
REDNECK covered in grease.

REDNECK DRIVER
Get out the way, boy.

LES
(jumping on the truck's
hood)
You can't do this to my car.

REDNECK DRIVER
(rolling out)
Boy, I've driven with deers,
antelopes, even with bears strapped
to my bumper.

(CONTINUED )
57.

REDNECK DRIVER (cont'd)
A sixty-five pound sack a fly shit
like you ain’t gonna shake me a
hell of difference.

LES
Please, I'll do anything. I can
pay you. I'll give you everything
I have.

He jams on the breaks. Les flies over the front hood.
Mercedes can't believe it.

EXT. TOW TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Les count out his money in front of the driver. The driver
snatches the money, and walks around to the side of the
truck.

LES
Be gentle. Please.

REDNECK DRIVER
For eighty dollars?

He hits a switch. The Cadillac CRASHES DOWN. Les is
mortified. The redneck driver jumps into his truck,
laughing. As he drives away, Mercedes approaches a
distraught Les. After another huge swig from the magnum, she
offers him some champagne.

MERCEDES
This might help.

LES
(harking back to his Dad's
champagne toast)
No, thanks, I already had some
tonight.

MERCEDES
I'm really sorry about this, I feel
like it was all my fault.

LES
Nah, I should've given the car to
the valet.
(quiet)

It's too bad about your friend.

MERCEDES
He was a jerk anyway. I don't know
why I even hung around with him.

(CONTINUED )
58.
CONTINUED:
MERCEDES (cont'd)
(beat)
Why don't we get out of here?

LES
And go where? With the amount of
money I have left in my pocket, we
have two choices. Sit at a parking
meter for twenty minutes, or go buy
ourselves a paper.

Mercedes laughs. It really isn't funny.

MERCEDES
I know a quiet spot, with plenty of
free parking.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

A dense forest. Cadillac Brougham hell. We can barely SEE
the beams of the Cadillac's headlights.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

The car bounces along on a steep, narrow dirt mountain road
more suited for a horse or a 4x4.

Whatever it is, it's not good for the car. Mercedes has
moved beside Les. The radio is off. Les concentrates.
Quiet. We hear the pounding of the shocks and the occasional
branch scraping the car. And then a Mercedes HICCUP and a
giggly “excuse me.”

THEIR POV - STRAIGHT AHEAD

Bit by bit, the trees vanish. There's nothing but stars.
The entire city sits below us, glowing like an expensive
breach. It's a glorious sight. Les stops the car.

They get out. Mercedes, clutching her now three quarters
empty bottle of champagne, stares up at the stars. Mercedes
is more than light headed. She's drunk. Les checks the
condition of the car. It looks fine.

Les gapes at Mercedes and the surroundings. It's a fantasy
come true. An awkward silence.

LES

This is unbelievable up here. How
did you find this place?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

59.

MERCEDES

Someone I know used to take me
here.

(Les is shattered)
Not a boyfriend. My father used to
bring me here to show me how pretty
the world could be if you could
step away and see it from a
distance.

Les doesn't know what to say.

MERCEDES
(Cont'd)
I haven't been here in a long time.

She's about to sit in front of the car.

Les leans

FLIPS OPEN

an expensive set of GOLF CLUBS. Les searches the

bag and pulls out a BLANKET.

He races to the front of the car and spreads it out on the
front hood.

Les grins

MERCEDES
(in between swigs)
All we're missing is some soft
romantic music.

and whips into the car.

(CONTINUED )
60.
CONTINUED:

INSIDE THE CADDIE

He flips over his "MERCEDES" tape to the "SLOW" side. He
waits for it to begin. It's the perfect song for the perfect
moment. He smiles and adjusts the volume.

BUT, just as he's about to slide cut, the sound garbles and

dies. He ejects the tape. It's destroyed. He flips on the
radio. The reception sucks. HE shuts it off and looks out

at Mercedes filling her glass up. He needs music. He opens
the GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

LES' P.O.V. - A ROW OF CASSETTES

Grandfather's top ten: Como, Bennett, Torme, Sinatra, and
Humperdinck. He grabs "Greatest Hits of the 40's" and loads
it into the deck. "Strangers in the Night."

Nestled in the woods, above the city, it's beautiful. I wish
it were me. Mercedes, deep in thought and alcohol, gulps
away. An awkward moment for Les. He looks out at the
spectacular view.

SINATRA
"Strangers in the night, exchanging
glances, wondering in the night,
what were the chances, we'd be
sharing love, before the night was
through."

MERCEDES
Do you want to dance?

LES
To this? Where?

MERCEDES
(getting up on the hood
with her stiletto heels)
Right up here. You couldn't pray
for a more romantic setting.

Her heels on the hood are killing him, but he doesn't want to
upset the momentum. He hops up. They get close. She's
taller. It's awkward.

SINATRA
‘Love was just a glance away, a
warm embracing dance away.'

MERCEDES
Maybe I should take my shoes off?

(CONTINUED )
61.
CONTINUED:

Les looks to the sky as if to say, "Thank you, God." They
resume dancing. As Frankie sings on, they get closer and
closer, until Mercedes attaches her mouth to Les'. Within
moments they've eased themselves down onto the hood, and now
they're really going at it. Passion!

SINATRA
‘It turned out so right, for
strangers in the night.'

As Frankie gets into his "doobee doobee doos," the song fades
and we hear a THUMP.

CLOSE ON LES
His eves dart open. ANOTHER THUMP. It's the hood of the

Cadillac caving in. He can't even kiss her now. ANOTHER
THUMP! He pulls himself away, panicked.

LES
Get up. Get off the hood.
MERCEDES
What's the matter?
LES
The hood is caving in. Quick, get
off.
SINATRA

(the next song)
‘That’s life, that’s what people
say.’

Les is destroyed. There's a huge deep dent in the hood.

 

LES
Oh my God. I'll be making repair
payments from Siberia.
(packing up to go)
We have to get this fixed.

MERCEDES
(plastered -- drink in
hand)
What's the rush, Les? I love this
song.
LES

(more to himself)
Unfortunately, so does my
grandfather.

62.
CONTINUED:

Les leaps into the car. Mercedes falls in. He tries
ejecting the cassette, but it's jammed. He tries to get it
out. Forget it. He lowers the volume. She won't let him
start the car, she's all over him. She starts kissing his
neck, unbuttoning his shirt, kissing his chest.

MERCEDES
(sexy)
You have such baby soft skin.

He can't resist her. He begins to smile. Suddenly her head
drops into his lap. He winces... and then we hear some
SNORING... He looks down. She's fast asleep.

INT. DEAN'S PARENTS' GARAGE - NIGHT

Cluttered with spare parts, bikes, tools, you name it. The
Cadillac is parked beside the Datsun. The hood is up. Dean
pounds the dent out from the inside. Charles, with a pocket
camera hung around his neck, watches. Les paces nervously.

DEAN
You have balls, Les. You
definitely have balls for snatching
this car. I'm impressed.

CHARLES

Let's see the license.
LES

Forget it. It's ugly.
DEAN

Of course it is. Big deal.
LES

Nope.
CHARLES

(holding up his camera)
Come on. Let me take a picture of
it.

LES
Okay.

Dean turns around. Charles readies his camera. Les whips
his open wallet by their noses. The camera FLASHES. Forget
it. Radar couldn't have picked it up.

(CONTINUED )
63.
CONTINUED:

LES
(rubbing his eyes from the
flash)
Happy, now?

DEAN
(turning to the hood)
Take a look.

Dean puts the mallet down and gently drops the hood. Les
crouches down to check. Dean stands, confident.

LES
Excellent work, Dean. Really
spectacular. You saved me.

DEAN
So I guess we can go to Archie's
now?

LES

Dean, I promise next weekend, but
not tonight. Mercedes doesn't have
to be home for a couple of hours.

DEAN
Les, take a look at something.

Dean walks Les to the passenger side of the car. Mercedes is
out cold, her face squished up against the glass.

DEAN
Unless you're into some intense
kinky shit, and you never know
after tonight, this Mercedes has a
dead battery.

Les is depressed. Dean's rolling.

DEAN
We're talking about Archie's
Atomic, Les. It's in the middle of
nowhere. You can't get there
without a license. No buses, no
trains, no planes. Only the
slickest driving machines you've
ever seen.

Dean pulls a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and
hands it to Les.

(CONTINUED )
64.

CONTINUED:
DEAN
Here are the directions my brother
gave me.
Les glances at it.
CHARLES

How do you know it's any good?
You've never even been there.

DEAN
Charles, do I tell you what kind of
dictionaries to buy?

LES
(looking for an out)
I dunno, Dean. I'm a little tired,
I don't feel like driving on the
highway.

DEAN
Are you shittin' me? You got your
license twelve hours ago and you're
already tired of driving? My
mother makes ridiculous statements
like that.

LES
Forget it, Dean. I just can't.

DEAN
Can't?

Dean grabs the mallet and walks over to the hood. He lifts
the mallet high into the air, assuming the executioner's
position.

DEAN
Fine. But as precise and delicate
a task as it may have appeared,
fixing those dents... I could
easily put them all back.

LES
(nowhere to go)
This place better be worth it.

DEAN
The drive alone will be worth it.

EXT. DEAN'S HOUSE - A HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
Backing out onto the street.

LES
(o.8.)
Did you wipe your feet, Dean?

DEAN

(o.8.; like a baby)
Yes, I wiped the concrete off my
feet.

(sounding great)
Two seconds in the car and I can
already feel the change. This is
too much. Charles, push in the
lighter, I have a surprise for
everyone.

INSIDE THE CADDIE

Dean holds out three cigars. Behind him, we SEE Mercedes out
cold. Charles still has his camera around his neck.

LES
No way, Dean. Not in here.

DEAN
Les, this is a car, not an oxygen
tent.

LES

Forget it. If there's even the
slightest evidence to suggest that
I took this car, my dad will
slaughter first and ask questions
later.

Dean bounces back into his seat, shaking his head. Quiet.

Dean smirks... and then the loudest FART you've ever heard.
They crack up.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT

Sparsely crowded, the Caddie crawls along in the middle lane
at a tortoise's pace, being passed by cars, left and right.

66.

INSIDE THE CAR

Sheer boredom. Charles takes it in stride. Dean watches
incredulously as a JOGGER passes them on the right and a
STREET SWEEPER passes them on the left.

DEAN
Les, how about taking the car out
of neutral and putting it in gear?
A bath is more exciting than this.

Les takes it like a man.

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
Stopped at a red light.
INSIDE THE CAR

Dean has given up. We hear The Funeral March horn... "DUM,
DUM, DaDUM... DUM, DaDUM, DaDUM, DaDUM."

THE GLOSSY BLACK GTO

with the THREE DEMENTED HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS, pulls up beside
them REVVVVVVING its engine.

INSIDE THE CADDIE

The makings of a drag. This is what Dean has been waiting
for. The stares. The challenge. Charles and Dean smirk at
the DRIVER. Les revs his engine. Charles and Dean smile at
Les... The light turns GREEN!

Sorry boys. Les pulls away slowly, while the GTO screeches
away leaving them in a cloud of burnt rubber.

DEAN
What? Les are you sixteen, or are
you sixty? You could've given that
gear head a run for his money.

LES
Dean, this is my grandfather's car.
Get me a car that I'm not
genetically related to, and I
assure you things will change.

DEAN
Les. No one's asking you to break
the sound barrier.

DEAN (cont'd)
It just feels like we're on some
sort of kiddie ride, that's all.

CHARLES
Give him a break, Dean. He just got
his license.

DEAN
His tractor license. I mean what's
the point? What's the damn point
of driving a car if you're not
going to take advantage of it?

LES
Whatever happened to your beliefs
about cars representing freedom in
America?

DEAN
At twenty miles per hour?

CHARLES
What's the difference? Twenty,
eighty, you're in a car.

DEAN
There's a big difference, Charles.
Freedom at eighty miles per hour is
America. Freedom at twenty miles
per hour is communism.

End of round one. The fighters return to their corners.

INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lights out. Windows open. Curtains blowing. Mom has the

MOM

No, it's okay. I could lose a few
pounds.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
Dad walking like a zombie opens the door to the garage.

DAD'S P.O.V. - THE GARAGE

Pitch black. Can't see a thing. He tries flicking on the

IN THE BEDROOM

Mom is back under the covers. The TV is on.

IN THE KITCHEN

Dad opens a drawer, pulls out a flashlight and tests it.
DAD AT THE DOOR TO THE GARAGE

About to open it, flashlight on. Suddenly... the INTERCOM
booms on, startling Dad.

MOM

Richard? Richard?

DAD
Yes.

MOM
I changed my mind. I'm not hot any
longer, I'm under the covers now.
I'm hungry. Can you make me a

With extra bacon bits?

Dad suddenly feels ill.

motors down the highway, being passed by everyone.

INSIDE THE CADILLAC

They're still in their corners, hanging onto their pride.
Mercedes, asleep or unconscious, is huddled in the backseat.
Les inches up to fifty-four miles per hour, then locks in the
cruise control. He tries ejecting the cassette. It's still
jammed. He turns it on. Frankie... This is Cadillac
cruising at its finest.

MERCEDES

shifts positions, cuddling up against Dean. Guess who's
smiling now?

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The Cadillac glides along.

INT. CADILLAC - LES - NIGHT

Frankie sets the mood. We HEAR a click. A camera flash
fills the car.

CHARLES AND LES TURN AROUND

Mercedes lies on the backseat with her top few buttons
undone. A bit of her bra is exposed.

LES
You asshole! Button up her shirt!
Now!
DEAN
Forget it, Les. Look at us.
(gently)

At the present moment we're three
wild animals bombing down the
highway in a Cadillac with the
cruise control set on fifty-five.

LES
Well, excuse me, that's the speed
limit. I don't need a ticket my
first night out.

DEAN
A ticket? Look at your windshield.
We're moving so slowly the flies
have time to get out of the way.

LES
Very funny.

DEAN
Not only that. Listen to this
crap. My parents don't even listen
to this.

CHARLES
Dean, you need a doctor.

Dean clicks off another picture.

LES
(reaching back)
Gimme the camera, Dean.

Dean ignores him, snaps another. Les lunges back, one eye on
the road. He grabs the camera. They struggle. The Caddie
starts to swerve. Charles tries to break them up. In the
commotion the camera FLASH goes off right in Les' eyes.

LES
shit!

Les is blinded. The car swerves, recklessly. Dean laughs,
hysterically. Charles braces himself.

LES' P.O.V. - THE HIGHWAY AS JIMI HENDRIX WOULD SEE IT

A purple haze. An EXIT RAMP.

EXT. RAMP A SIGN SAYS "REDUCE SPEED TO TWENTY" - NIGHT

The car bombs uncontrollably down the ramp headed straight
for a BUSY INTERSECTION. But just ahead, a HUGE PUDDLE, the
one Les slept through in class, the one he got wrong on the
exam.

He jams on the brakes!!!!! What an idiot. Hitting the

water, the Caddie SPINS OUT OF CONTROL, and slides through
the intersection BACKWARDS, just narrowly missing traffic.

LES

whips the car back around. But it doesn't matter, the
windshield's a blur, covered in water. A terrified Les feels
for the windshield wipers. Got ‘em. Instant vision:

TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS - HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THEM

He SCREAMS, yanking the car left, across traffic, through a
PLYWOOD FENCE, then off:

A VERY STEEP INCLINE

They're airborne. Dean howls like a cowboy.

THE CADDIE GLIDES THROUGH THE AIR

landing on a muddy hill, cushioning the fall. Temporary
relief. Very temporary. Terrified faces, as the car races
through high grass, and suddenly explodes into:

THE PARKING LOT OF A SHAKEY'S

slamming to a stop in a parking space, pulling in perfectly,
next to an OLDER JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE in a Dodge station
wagon. They pull out as if nothing happened.

INSIDE THE CADDIE - ON LES

Inhaling and exhaling. Glad to be intact, he looks ahead,
his hands locked to the steering wheel.

In the backseat, Mercedes, still out cold, is mushed on top
of Dean. Her lips glisten, a millimeter away from his.
Grinning, he stretches to meet Mercedes' lips. We SEE some
sign of life in Mercedes. She's waking up. She doesn't look
well.

Dean's lips are almost there. Stretching... almost... lips
puckered...

MERCEDES
(i11 sounding)
I have to throw up.

LES SPINS AROUND

LES
Open the door. Get her out!

DEAN
Iocan't. I'm trapped. Help me!

Mercedes moans. Les jumps out, rips open the back door.

LES
Not in the car, please.

Les tears a barely conscious Mercedes off Dean.
MERCEDES' P.O.V. -— ROMEO
He holds her in his arms. She closes her eyes.
LES
practically drops her on the pavement, more worried about the
car. Charles staggers out of the car, moving as if all his
bones are broken. Dean bounces out.
DEAN

I apologize for everything, Bro.

That was definitely worth the price

of admission. In fact, that ride

made up for a whole life of

boredom.

Les surveys THE CAR. Other than the fact that it's covered
in grime and dirt, it looks okay.

CHARLES
Where the hell are we?

Dean sees something across the street and walks towards it,
mesmerized.

DEAN'S P.O.V. - "SICK SAM'S 24 HOUR RENT A CAR"

A slimy fourth rate organization. It sounds incredible, but

spotlights, under a sign that says, "ONLY $180.00 A WEEK," is

DEAN
I don't think you want her in your
car, Les. I think she's about to
blow.

CHARLES
(looking back)
He's right. It wouldn't hurt to
get her a soda or something.

DEAN

Look, Les.

(pointing out a hose

coiled against a wall)
There's a hose right over here.
While we hose the car down, Charles
can go in here with Mercedes and
get her something to drink.

LES
Charles?

CHARLES
(somewhat reluctant)
Sure.

Charles gathers up Mercedes and carries her in the side

entrance.

MERCEDES
(a gonna’)
You have such baby soft skin.

Charles blushes. Dean grabs Les by the arm, to walk him over
to the sidewalk.

DEAN
I want you to see something.
(motioning to the Caddie
on the ramp)
Look up there and tell me what's on
your mind.

LES
Death.

DEAN
Not you. The car. Does anything
strike you as odd?

LES
It's a Cadillac.

DEAN
Not only is it a Cadillac, but it's
this one's clone. Exactly the same
year, color, wheels, everything.

LES
So.
DEAN
I just want you to think about it.
LES
Dean.
DEAN

Fine. But just promise me you'll
think about it.

LES
Can we hose the car down, now?

They walk back to their Caddie.

INT. SHAKEY'S - NIGHT
Charles and Mercedes in a booth. Slumped over on the table,

Mercedes looks dead. A WAITRESS walking by, gives Charles a
disdainful look.

Just listen to what I have to say

LES
Fine.

INT. SHAKEY'S - NIGHT

We hear Les' reaction echo through the restaurant.

LES

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING
MIND? !?!?

Everyone looks up.

OUTSIDE IN

LES
(outraged)
I will not do that! I will not
switch cars! You're a nut!

DEAN

(pleading)
You'll never get an opportunity
like this again, as long as you
live.

We'll cruise up to Archie's without
worrying about scratching the
paint, dirtying the interior, or
smashing the car. Look at the car,
Les. Not a scratch.

If you ask me, it's a sign from the

Les and Dean stand below the Cadillac ramp. lLes' eyes are

Les looks

DEAN

You worked real hard for that
license you have in your wallet.
You've had sixteen years of
humiliation, begging for lifts from
people who couldn't give a shit
about your image. That wasn't
easy. I know. You had to stand
and watch as all the pretty girls
in our grade drove away smiling in
some older jerk's car, and grin and
bear it when the girl of your
dreams asked you what kind of car
you drove. But that's all over
now.

(beat)
That thing in your wallet is not
just an ordinary piece of paper,
Les. It's a license, an automobile
license. But it's not even just an
automobile license, it's a license
to live. Did you hear me, Les? A
license to live, to be free, to go
wherever you want, whenever you
want, with whoever you choose.
That license in your pocket is the
single most liberating document
you'll come across in your whole
life. I would die to have one.

DEAN
Les, to live in fear, is not to

LES
What about getting the car back?

DEAN
A breeze. If the attendant's
awake, we use Charles as a decoy.
He looks old enough.
77.

EXT. OFFICE BOOTH - NIGHT

Tiny and sleazy. Les and Dean's reflection CAN BE SEEN in

the window. A radio plays some easy listening music. An old-
timer with a single strand of hair slicked back lounges in

his chair, fast asleep. His name tag reads, SICK SAM. A
REVOLVER sits in a half open desk drawer. Les and Dean don't
see it.

The CADILLAC KEY is clearly marked, on the board above him.
Opposite the board, there is a hole for people to talk
through. Dean tries the door. It's locked. He looks at Les
as if to say, "At least we tried." Les signals for him to
wait a second.

EXT. GRANDPA'S CADILLAC - CLOSE ON THE TRUNK - NIGHT

as it lifts open. The blanket, and cooler, and the golf
clubs. Les reaches into the golf bag and pulls out a BALL
FETCHER.

EXT. THE OFFICE BOOTH - NIGHT

The ball fetcher extends through the hole, barely grasping
the Cadillac key. As Les gently pulls it back, the keys fall
and land on Sick Sam's shoulder. They sit there like bird
shit.

Les maneuvers the ball fetcher like a fine surgeon, lifting
the keys off Sick Sam's shoulder. He pulls them out. A big
sigh. Dean reaches into the office and turns up the radio.
LES RUNS UP THE RAMP

and gets inside the car. The interior is so white, it's
eerie. He slips the Caddie into neutral, and carefully rolls
it down the ramp, backwards. Dean pushes him out of the lot.

INT. SHAKEY’S - NIGHT

A bored Charles, a couple of cokes, and Sleeping Beauty.

EXT. ROLLER COASTER RAMP - NIGHT
Grandfather's Cadillac rests on the ramp just as the other

one did. Only this one has a front license plate that reads
GRANDPA.

AT THE OFFICE BOOTH

Les switches the rental key with Grandpa's key, and then
attaches it to the ball fetcher. He reinserts it in through
the hole, and places it back up on the hook.

EXT. RENTAL CADDIE - NIGHT

Les and Dean, all smiles, quietly get into the Caddie. They
drive across the street.

INT./EXT. SHAKEY'S - NIGHT

Leaving. Les carries a green Mercedes. Dean holds a steaming
hot slice of pizza. A perplexed Charles carries the cokes.

EXT. CADILLAC - CLOSE ON THE TRUNK - NIGHT
It flips open.

LES
(o.8.)
I don't know if this is a good
idea.

Les holds Mercedes. Charles and Dean remove the clubs and
the cooler.

DEAN
What are you talking about? Ina
half hour there's gonna be babes
all over us. She'll kill it for
us.

As Les places her down in the trunk, she opens her eyes.
MERCEDES' P.O.V. - LES
Holding her. He smiles. Looks like Gene Kelly. He lays her
down gently, and then covers her with the blanket. She may
as well be in her own bed. She's in another world.
DEAN
In all your life, did you ever
imagine you'd see a Mercedes fit in

the trunk of a Cadillac?

LES
I feel bad.

DEAN
For her? That trunk is bigger than

Les gently lowers the trunk.

The trunk closes. The SCREEN BECOMES BLACK.

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Factories, plants, warehouses... The Caddie speeds along.
INSIDE THE CADILLAC

Pepsi cups on the dash. ROCK on the RADIO. Les is a new
Man. Charles is very confused. Dean, wearing funky
sunglasses and a corny golf visor, is stretched out in the
backseat between the golf clubs and the cooler. He stuffs
his face with pizza.

CHARLES
The radio works.

LES
I fixed it.

DEAN
Whoops, I just dropped some pizza
on the seat.

LES
Leave it, Deano. I'll get it
later.

CHARLES

What's going on? An hour ago you
were afraid one of us would fart in
here, and now you don't even flinch
when Dean drops tomato sauce on the
seats. Don't you care about what
happens to the car?

LES

Sure I care. But, there's
something special about tonight,
Charles...

about Mercedes, about the car
surviving the spinout without even
a scratch, about us, being in a
car, alone, without any parents.

Charles, we've been waiting for
this night for sixteen years. If I
have to worry about farts and
tomato sauce now, when I'm twenty-
five I'll be living in a room with
rubber walls.

Dean leans over, CRANKS THE VOLUME UP, HOWLS with excitement.

DEAN
RELAX, CHARLES!!! THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT!!!

INT. SICK SAM'S OFFICE BOOTH - NIGHT

Sick Sam, snoring now, leaning way back in his chair,
flinches and sends his chair tipping over backwards. He
wakes up, startled.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mom, wide awake, finishes her herring and mayonnaise
sandwich. Dad tries to sleep. Late night news is on TV. A
FEMALE CORRESPONDENT stands in a CROWD OF PROTESTERS. They
circle peacefully with placards, rhythmically chanting: “WE
ARE ONE WITH THE INFINITE SUN, FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER...”

ANCHORWOMAN
I'm standing outside the gates of
Allied Technologies, where a group
of peaceful protesters have
gathered to demonstrate against the
late night transportation of
military hardware through our city
streets...

Outside the gates of ALLIED TECHNOLOGIES. Dozen of
PROTESTERS hold hands and chant. Several POLICE CARS pull

She isn't sold.

EXT. DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
The Cadillac zips by, on its way to:
ARCHIE'S ATOMIC BROILER

High tech fifties, it's more fantastic than Dean described.
It's the most spectacular curb service hangout on the planet.
Rock and Roll blasts through the sound system. Beautiful
people dance, mingle, and lean up against their stylish,
squeaky clean cars, sipping cokes and eating ice cream
sundaes.

INT./EXT. CADILLAC - THE BOYS

pull to a stop on the lip of its entrance, their faces aglow,
their mouths hang open. We HOLD AT A DISTANCE as the Caddie
pulls into Archie's and parks beside a WHITE STUDEBAKER
that's pulling out. They get out to order.

WITH THE BOYS - WALKING UP TO ORDER

Chrome glistens. You can see your reflection on every
surface, it's more than immaculate. And the women... More
than any man can handle, even Dean. Busty, curvaceous
"TARTS" on roller skates, their hair flowing in the wind,
whisk in between and around the cars.

Dean spots THREE SUGAR SWEET GIRLS staring at them.
DEAN
(to Les and Charles)
Order for me, I'll get dessert.

Dean veers off. The girls smile at him when they see him
coming. Les and Charles get on line to order.
82.

EXT. ARCHIE'S COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

TWO TRAYS slide out, overflowing with golden french fries,
juicy burgers, and bubbly cokes... a carbonated mist.

Charles and Les step away from the counter with their trays.
They walk back to the Caddie and attach the trays to the
windows. They get:

INTO THE CADDIE
Dean jumps in, all smiles.

DEAN
It's all set, they'll be here ina
couple of minutes. One for each of
us.

A BLACK CAR pulls in beside them, while Les passes out the
fries and the cokes, placing his and Charles' on the dash.

CHARLES
I'll never doubt you again, Dean.

LES
My dreams never get this good.

DEAN
My fantasies never get this good.
And this is only the beginning.

As Charles reaches for the burgers, the SALT SHAKER goes
flying. Dazed and starving, Charles swings open the door...
CHINK as the door slams open against the car they're parked
beside. They turn:

IT'S THE BLACK GTO
Charles stands there looking silly. The INSANE DRIVER and
his TWO CRAZY FRIENDS, swigging on bottles of whiskey, get
out of the GTO and surround Charles. He wilts back into the
Caddie, slamming the door behind him. Some of the food falls
off.
INSIDE THE CADDIE
Dean can't believe what's happened.

LES

Jesus. It's those maniacs from the
party.

CHARLES

Roll up the windows! Quick! Roll
them up!

As the window zips up, Dean reaches for a burger, and just
barely grasps one. The window closes on his hand and the
burger.

DEAN
Charles, you spasticated idiot.

The window zips down and up. Dean pulls his hand in and drops
the burger. The burgers and sundaes are still on the trays.
They watch like kittens as the three DROPOUTS inspect:

THE DAMAGE - CLOSE ON THE GTO DOOR

There's definitely A PAINT CHIP. Nothing major, but enough
for three homicidal maniacs to slaughter three innocent kids
over.

While the two buddies stare maniacally at Charles, the driver
reaches into the car and pulls out the baddest looking TIRE
IRON you've ever seen. He signals with his index finger for
the boys to get out of the car.

INSIDE THE CADDIE

LES
(starting the car)
Oh my God.

DEAN
What the hell are you doing, Les?
You can't back away from these
motherfuckers, they're just toying
with you.

CHARLES
Dean, those motherfuckers are
MOTHERFUCKERS. I wouldn't mess
with them or anyone related to
them.

The Driver, swinging the tire iron, jumps up on the front
hood. At the same time the THREE SWEET GIRLS Dean picked up
approach the Caddie. Dean ducks. Les pops the car into
reverse and fishtails out.

(CONTINUED )
84.
CONTINUED:

The Driver holds on as long as he can. Then he goes flying
off the hood. The food goes flying off the trays. The
French fries and cokes on the dash jerk back on the seats.

The two crazy friends laugh as the Caddie retreats with the
trays attached to the windows like toy wings. The Driver
gets up, angrier than hell. The buddies shiver in their
boots. The Driver jumps into the car. They're coming after
Les.

INSIDE THE CADDIE

Les races away. Dean wants to cry. He turns. The girls
stand confused. Archie's fades in the distance. Charles
spots the dropouts getting into their car.

CHARLES
Shit! They're coming after us.

Les floors it. Cutting right across the path of a cop CAR
pulling into the parking lot.

THE GTO DRIVER

revs his engine, then squeals back, without looking... SMASH.
Direct hit into the CAR. They're not going anywhere. PUSH
IN ON the GTO Driver. He looks back at the GTO's damage, then
watches as the Cadillac speeds away, cutting down a side
street. He wants blood. The driver of the smashed car looks
at the damage on his car then at the GTO driver. Sparks.

goes down the street and stops at a corner.

INSIDE THE CADDIE

Les looks ahead, curiously.

LES' P.O.V. - A PROCESSION OF TOW TRUCKS

car: pickup trucks, Volkswagen Beetles, old tired-looking

American cars, all with faded paint. And then a showroom AUDI
5000 TURBO, just like Les' mom's.

LES
(o.s8.)
That AUDI looks just like my
mother's.

We HOLD ON it, then turn right, against the procession.
Ahead, we SEE a CROWD OF PEOPLE, a TV CREW, and some POLICE

Natalie sees Les. He sees her. She's in shock. Les pleads
through the glass, mouthing everything, making sure she'll

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The Caddie coasts along. Up ahead...

AN OFFICER

waves cars over randomly with his flashlight. He signals the
Caddie. It's a DRUNK DRIVING ROADBLOCK.

INSIDE THE CADDIE
Les is white. They pull in behind a CAR with its TRUNK

FLIPPED OPEN. While the PLASTERED DRIVER leans up against
the car, A COP examines his license under a flashlight.

LES
This is great. This is really
classic.

DEAN

What are you sweating for Les? A
license is like a credit card.
Sooner or later, you gotta break
‘em in.

Les is stung. A HUGE COP walks to the car, shines his
flashlight in Les' eyes, leans in, and inhales deeply. The
cop pauses... All of a sudden, we hear a HICCUP. The boys
lock at each other. It's Mercedes. The cop holds his look.
More hiccups. Dean and Charles pretend it's them.

Pulling out his wallet, he hands the cop a SCHOOL I.D. CARD.

This is all I have, Sir. I'm
afraid the registration is with my

Alright. Sit tight.

The cop jots down the Caddie's license plate number and then
returns to his car, where he picks up the radio mouthpiece.

Why didn't you give him your

flashed in front of us before?

Les can't hide it any longer...
LES
I didn't.
(cleansing himself)
I failed my exam.

CHARLES AND DEAN
You what?!

(CONTINUED )
91.
CONTINUED:

LES
I failed. I got six wrong.

DEAN
You mean to tell me you've been
driving around all night without a
license?

Les nods. Dean laughs like a mad man.

CHARLES
At least you did one smart thing
tonight. You stole the car froma
family member. They're less likely
to press charges.

Les and Dean look at each other. Charles knows something's
up.

CHARLES
What's going on?

INT. COP CAR - NIGHT
Two cops. The huge cop holds Les' I.D.

HUGE COP
Jesus Christ! This punk doesn't
even have a license!

The RADIO chatters: Something big is going on.

RADIO
We have a full emergency situation
at Allied Tech. A possible four-
fifteen, riot group... Stand by
for instructions.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

CHARLES
(raging)

You traded cars? You traded cars?
Are you guys lunatics? People go
to prison for lesser crimes. We
have a future ahead of us...
transcripts, applications, resumes.
This'1ll go on our records. We're
scarred for life.

LES
Nobody's going to jail, Charles.
We're juveniles.

CHARLES
Speak for yourselves.

DEAN
Charles? Will you take a pill, or
something. Nothing's gonna happen.

CUT TO:

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

The boys, SPREAD-EAGLED against the car. They're being
frisked. Charles gives Dean a look.

HUGE COP
(to Les)
Would you mind opening the trunk
for me?

The boys swallow at the same time. Les takes the key from
the ignition, and walks slowly, very slowly, to the trunk.

LES' HAND
shakes as he tries to fit the key in the key hole.
INSIDE THE COP CAR
The radio is loud and clear.
RADIO
Emergency fifty-four zero five!!!
Fifty-four zero five! Maximum
assistance is required.

BACK AT THE CADILLAC TRUNK

Les slips the key in. He's about to turn it... Suddenly, we
hear a VERY LOUD SIREN. They look up.

THE COP

leaps from his car, siren wailing, screaming and motioning
for his partner.

(CONTINUED )
93.
CONTINUED:

COP
Let's go! Fifty-four zero five in
progress!!!

The huge cop takes off. As the cop car speeds away, Les
doesn't know whether to smile or to cry.

DEAN
Piece of cake, Les. Let's go get
the car.

INT. SICK SAM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sam tidies up. He pulls out the REVOLVER, checks it, and
puts it in his shoulder holster. He then takes the CASH from
the register and puts it in a CASH BOX. Humming a happy
tune, he reaches along the wall to click a switch. He looks
at the lot's sign:

SAM'S P.O.V. - SICK SAM'S 24 HOUR RENT-A-CAR

The lights behind "24 HOUR" go off. It now reads: "Sick
Sam's Rent a Car.”

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

Les is parked down the street from the car lot. They can just
see the "Grandpa" Caddie up on its "throne."

LES
Now remember, Charles, make it
sound like you've got a lot of
money to spend, but insist on a
test drive. Without one, you're
not interested. Can you handle
that?

CHARLES
(nervous)
Do I have a choice?

They both look at him.

LES
Whenever you're ready.

Charles hesitates, then gets out of the car. But before he
can take two steps, he stops dead in his tracks. In plain
sight THE CADILLAC IS BEING BACKED DOWN THE RAMP. Les
squeaks.

(CONTINUED )
94.

LES
I am dead. I am so dead, they're
gonna have to bury me twice.

INSIDE GRANDPA'S CADDIE

rolling down the ramp. The cash box sits beside Sick Sam.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
Silence. They watch the Cadillac squeal out of the lot.

CHARLES
Now what?

LES
(jamming the car in gear)
We don't have any choice. We
follow him.

CHARLES
How do you know where he's going
and when he'll stop?

LES
He's got to live somewhere around
here.

EXT. DESERTED HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Les travels a few car lengths behind Sam.
INSIDE LES' CADDIE

6.1 on the nerve scale. The GAS RESERVE LIGHT flashes.
They're running out of gas.

CHARLES
(whimpering)
Why couldn’t've you have stolen a
Honda or a diesel Rabbit, something
with better highway mileage?

DEAN
Charles, I know it's uncomfortable
sitting in wet diapers, but can you
just quit crying for a minute?

LES ZEROES OUT THE TRIP MILEAGE RECORDER

INT. SAM'S CADDIE - NIGHT

Sam fiddles with the radio. Sinatra:

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Sam passing through a burnt-out slum neighborhood, signals to
turn off. Les follows:

EXT. BOMBED OUT NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Deserted streets. A ghost town. Scarier and scarier. You
wouldn't want to run out of gas here, even in an armored car.

INSIDE LES' CADDIE

The mileage recorder reads twelve. Les follows a block
behind.

LES' P.O.V. - SICK SAM
cuts down a NARROW ALLEY. Les waits a moment, then follows,
turning off his lights.
EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
Sam drives very slowly. At the end of the alley, we SEE a
NEON BAR SIGN flickering. Sam drives out of the alley and
parks in front of the bar.
INSIDE LES' CADDIE
Les coasts to the lip of the alley and puts the car in park.
DEAN
I've heard of being hard up for a
drink, but this is ridiculous.
CHARLES

I don't think I'd want to go in
there.

(CONTINUED )
96.
CONTINUED:

LES
I don't think the Terminator would
want to go in there.

INSIDE SAM'S CADDIE

Sam places the cash box on the floor of the passenger side,
under the dash. He gets out and lumbers into the bar.

INSIDE THE CADILLAC
Dean leans in between Les and Charles. They're strategizing.

LES
(to Dean)
As goon as you see me turn the
lights on, pull in behind me. And
leave his key in the ignition.
It's the least we can do.

CHARLES
What about the hide-a-key? What
happens if it's not there?

LES
It better be there.
(beat)
Are you ready?

DEAN
Les, I was born ready.

Les gets out of the car, sprints down the alley and across
the street. Dean jumps over into the driver's seat.

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

Les, down on his hands and knees, feels under the back bumper
of Grandpa's Caddie... Nothing! He runs to the front bumper.
We hear the familiar sound of a REVVED ENGINE. And then we
hear "DUM, DUM, DaDUM... DUM, DaDUM, DaDUM, DaDUM."

Les lays down as flat as possible, rolling beneath the
Caddie.

LES' P.O.V. - FRONT UNDERNEATH THE CAR

The tires of the GTO approach just as Les spots the HIDE-A-
KEY BOX. He opens it up. The key sparkles.

(CONTINUED )
97.
CONTINUED:

INSIDE THE CADDIE - CHARLES AND DEAN

watch as the black GTO, scratched and dented from their duel,
pulls up behind the Caddie.

DEAN
Holy shit!

INSIDE THE GTO
Revenge. You can smell it.
DRIVER
Hey, that's the Caddie that fucked
us up. Let's thrash it, man.

They open their doors.

LES' P.O.V. - BOOTS WALK TOWARDS HIM

 

Cowboy boots, construction boots, the tip of a TIRE IRON, and
a SLEDGEHAMMER. All of a sudden he hears the shattering of
glass.

ONE OF THE DROPOUTS

kicks in the headlights with his cowboy boot. The driver
pounds the bumper with a sledgehammer. The third guy hacks
off the side mirrors, hubcaps, and the windshield wipers with
a tire iron.

LES

cringes with each blow. He can't take it any more. Witha
burst of confidence he pops up from beneath the Caddie.

Shocked, the dropouts stop their destruction. Les checks out
the damage. Takes charge.

LES
Hey. Hey! What the hell do you
think you're doing, man?
(motioning to the driver
holding the sledgehammer )
Gimme that.

The driver doesn't move. He's too stunned.
LES
Come on! What are you, attached to

it? Gimme it!

(CONTINUED )
98.

CONTINUED:
LES (cont'd)
(grabbing it out of the
driver's hand)
You think you geniuses know how to
wreck a car? I'll show you turkeys
how to fuck one up.

Les grabs the sledgehammer and as convincingly as possible
winds up, rolls his eyes, looks for help from God, and
smashes the front bumper. To everyone's surprise the bumper
falls off, crashing to the ground. Les can't believe it.

LES

That's how you fuck one up.
(pointing to the dislodged
side mirror)

None if this pansy side mirror

shit. My grandmother could knock

that off with a walking stick.
(throwing the sledgehammer
back to the driver)

Here's your Teddy Bear back.

The dropouts are blown away by Les' performance.
INSIDE THE CADDIE

Charles and Dean watch, unbelieving, as the dropouts start to
close in on Les. Les shuffles backwards, toward the bar.

DEAN
We gotta do something.

OUTSIDE THE BAR
Les continues his act. They're looking meaner.

LES
Now, I'm gonna walk inside this
shit hole, plant my bad ass down at
the bar, and get messed up. And
when I walk outta here in about
twenty minutes you candy-assed
faggots better not be playing with
my ride.

(pointing to the GTO)
Otherwise I'm gonna have to show
you dudes how a one-man wrecking
crew acts when he feels like
throwing a party.

Les turns, walks away, checking over his shoulder to see
their reaction. They don't buy it. They follow him in.

(CONTINUED )
99.
CONTINUED:

BACK AT THE CADDIE

Dean and-Charles slip out of the Cadillac.

LES WALKS INTO THE BAR

He just went from the frying pan into the fire.
LES' P.O.V. - AS HE KICKS OPEN THE DOORS TO THE BAR

This is where death hangs out. Everything stops. The music,
the "patrons", even the rats. They all stare. There's not a
guy in the bar that hasn't belted his girlfriend in the last
twenty-four hours. Sick Sam sits in the back corner with DOG
WOMAN.

LES

walks to the bar, like the town's new sheriff. The
floorboards creak beneath his white Reeboks. The dropouts
stay back, cautiously. Les may as well be tarred and
feathered.

TWO BEASTS with their "DEBUTANTE" GIRLFRIENDS make room for
Les at the bar. THE BARTENDER, a cross between Ivan the
Terrible and Ivan the Worst, leans over; nose to nose with
Les.

BARTENDER
(rough sadistic voice)
We just ran out of Kool-Aid.

Les chuckles, confidently, trying not to look intimidated.

LES
(dead serious)
Bourbon. Straight up.

Les turns around to look at all his dead relatives. Nobody
in the bar has flinched or said a word. We SEE Dean and
Charles looking in from outside. Les turns back to the bar.
The SHOT GLASS is there, overflowing with bourbon.

This is a kid who's never had a drink in his life. He picks
it up, checks it against the light, then downs it... It may
as well have been Drano. He can't swallow... He SPITS IT
OUT across the bar, trying to look macho. Before there can
be any reactions from the peanut gallery...

He leans over, an inch from the Bartender.

(CONTINUED )
100.

CONTINUED:
LES
(imitating the Bartender's
voice)
I thought you said you ran out of

Kool-Aid.

The Bartender's confused. Everyone's confused. What's up?

LES
How 'bout something with a little
body... something with some heat on

it.

Challenged, the Bartender reaches under the bar, and pulls up
a three quarter's full bottle of the Devil's mouth wash.
There's no label on it, only a FIVE-INCH WORM rests on the
bottom. The Bartender pours hima glass. Everyone gathers
around him, the dropouts as well.

Beads of sweat dot Les' forehead. Sixteen years, all coming
down to this moment. Coolly, he pushes the glass aside.
CONFUSION. He grabs the bottle. The crowd GASPS! Oddly, he
pours the alcohol into his hand, through his fingers. It
spills onto the bar, until he's left holding THE WORM in the
palm of his hand.

He takes the worm between his thumb and index finger, tilts
his head back, and in one motion drops it into his mouth and
swallows. INSTANT RESPECT. A ROAR OF APPROVAL. Within
seconds the music is back on and the place returns to
"normal."

Proudly, Les spins to look out at all his new friends, only
to see the DROPOUTS menacingly surround him.

THE DRIVER
Step outside, worm, we've got a job
to finish.

Les looks around for help. Forget it. In a joint like this
you have to do more than swallow a worm. He grabs THE
BEAST'S beer from the bar behind him.

LES
(shoving The Driver)
Back off, man. Don't crowd me.

DRIVER
(stepping towards him to
kill him)
Why you...

(CONTINUED )
101.
CONTINUED:

But before the driver can do anything, Les whips the beer
over his own shoulder, drenching the Beast behind him. And
then he tosses the empty glass at the driver, who, of course,
catches it. Les steps aside. The Beast whirls around... and
who does he see holding the glass? The driver with his two
buddies on either side of him.

The Beast winds up and nails the driver, sending the three
dropouts flying onto a table full of beers. As a MACK TRUCK
at the table is about to hit one of the dropouts, A DEVILISH
BAR GUY POPS UP IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA, screaming:

BAR GUY
(excited -- a la John
Belushi in "Animal
House")

BAR FIGHHHHHHT!!!!!

From out of nowhere, the biggest fist you've ever seen
punches through the Bar Guy like a drill press. KNOCK OUT!!!

Suddenly WW III erupts. Les, dodging heavy artillery, heads
for the exit.

OUTSIDE THE BAR

Charles and Dean run back to the Caddie. Les jumps into
Grandpa's Caddie, starts her up, and takes off.

Dean and Charles shoot into the vacant parking space in Sam's
Caddie. They bail out with the golf clubs and cooler.

INSIDE THE BAR

Sam nonchalantly weaves his way through the fight. He
approaches the CIGARETTE MACHINE by the front window.
Checking his change, he hears a SCREECH outside the bar. He
leoks out.

SAM'S P.O.V. - HIS SHINY CADILLAC

As if nothing happened.

INT. GRANDPA'S CADILLAC - BACK WITH LES AND THE BOYS

Bombing down the street. Jubilation. Laughter. Dean, now
in the front seat, has discovered the cash box.

Suddenly, Les HITS THE BRAKES. A FORTY FOOT SKID! Les is

Ohhhhhh shitttttiii¢it:

LES TURNS AROUND - LOOKING BACK AT A BAD DREAM

Sam's Cadillac is a few blocks away. He steps on it,
squealing backwards, until he's right beside it.

DEAN AND LES JUMP OUT

Dean reaches into Sam's Caddie, grabs the key, and opens the
trunk. Les pulls Mercedes out. Dean puts the key back.
Charles throws the cash box into Sam's backseat.

MERCEDES' P.O.V. - LES - AS SHE OPENS HER EYES

Cradling her again. Gary Cooper smiles. She wraps her arms
around him, cuddling, and closes her eyes.

Les throws her into the backseat.

INSIDE THE BAR

Sam turns away from the Bartender with the proper change.
Through the window, he sees his open trunk. HE SEES LES
getting into the Caddie. AND:

LES SEES HIM!!!

Les' biggest nightmare. He dives into the car and bullets
away.

INSIDE LES' CADDIE
Howls. Hoots. They've never been so happy and relieved.
SAM

flies out of the bar, GUN DRAWN. Aiming at the Caddie racing
away, he cocks his gun...

INSIDE THE CADDIE

More howls and hoots. There's joy in Mudville.

CHARLES

Awesome, Les. That was hall of

BOOM!!! A GUN SHOT blows out the back window. Les looks up
in his mirror, and sees Sam standing back in the distance.
Les makes a quick left...
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT
Sweeping through the turn, Les clips his back end against a
pile of garbage cans and a lamp post. His BACK BUMPER GOES
FLYING.

EXT./INT. SAM'S CADDIE

Sam, getting into his shiny Caddie, notices the cash box. He
relaxes. There's no reason to chase the boys.

INSIDE LES' CADDIE

Mercedes begins to come around. She opens her eyes and
speaks.

MERCEDES' P.O.V. - LES' SMILE

MERCEDES

DEAN
You didn't miss a thing.

She closes her eyes. They laugh like hyenas.

EXT. DEAN'S HOUSE - DAWN

Charles and Dean slip out of the car. Charles gently closes
the door.

Les looks at a sleeping Mercedes. Dean and Charles look in.
They whisper to each other.

DEAN
License or no license, Mario, that
was one intense display of driving.

CHARLES
You could be the only sixteen-year-
old in the country to open a stunt
driving school without a license.

Les smiles.

DEAN
And as far as a first night out
with a car goes, you've set the
standard. It's gonna be a tough
one to top.

LES
Thank God you don't get your
license for a few months.

DEAN
What are you gonna tell Sleeping
Beauty?

LES

I don't know. I may not...

Mercedes groans, moves around. Les signals silence. The
boys freeze. They wave good-byes. Les pulls away.

Signs of the sun. Les carries Mercedes to her front door.
She groggily relates her perception of the evening to Les.

MERCEDES
The dream was so bizarre,

Les. As

if I was trapped inside the trunk
of a car. And then suddenly the
trunk flipped open and there you
were, rescuing me. It was so

weird.

LES
It sounds kinda crazy.

MERCEDES
It was, I know it sounds

unbelievable. But somehow you were

you are right now. I felt so safe

Les, too in love to speak, stands her up on her doorstep.

It has, so far.

She smiles at his allusive compliment and moves even closer.

LES
Hopefully one day I'll get to tell
you how it ends... if I live.
MERCEDES

Well, I'll be waiting, Les.

Dad glances into the garage.

I feel terrible.
Dad, about to close the door, notices something.

MOM
What's the matter?

INSIDE THE GARAGE

Even with the emergence of daylight, it's still too dark to
notice the condition of the Caddie.

DAD
Why is the garage door open?

MOM
Maybe Natalie left it open?

DAD
Why would she? She took the Audi.

DAD'S P.O.V. - OUTSIDE THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE

Okay, honey. Just try and breathe

Everything stops; his feet, his voice, his heart... As he
walks around the car we can hear his blood boiling.

The bumpers. The hubcaps. THE BACK WINDOW! Dad puts his
hand through it, unbelieving. He examines the severed
antenna, the mutilated wipers, then looks into the car.

Ready to explode. Les slithers out the opposite door, away

Les can't speak. Dad walks around the car. Les goes the
other way. They circle. Mom stands in between them, leaning

There's not a damn car in sight.

LES
It's a red light.

DAD
Les. We're rushing your mother to
the hospital, not a bridge game.
Go through it! Just get us there.

Les smiles, looks both ways, then tries to take off... Only
one problem: the engine is revving, but the Caddie's not
moving.

DAD
What happened?

LES
I don't know. I'm pressing on the
gas, but it won't go anywhere.

DAD
It sounds like the transmission.
(frustrated)
Try the other gears.

Les tries them all. Nothing. Shifting into park, the car
JOLTS BACKWARDS as he passes REVERSE.

CONTINUED:

LES
(looking at Dad)
Only reverse works.

Dad doesn't like it. Mom is in more pain. She winces and
groans. Dad feels for her.

DAD
Alright, alright. But take it
easy.

Les loves it. He shifts into reverse, turns to look through
the back window, braces his arm behind the seat, and takes
off.

OUTSIDE THE CADDIE

Popeye Doyle screeches the car around and peels away.

EXT. STREETS - DAY

The Caddie, in reverse, bombs down the street, its right turn
signal on. In the left lane is a long WEDDING PROCESSION.

INSIDE THE CADDIE

Mom is in great pain. Les has to make the turn. He zips up
to the front of the line, then makes a sweeping left turn
from the middle lane, and because an OLD BLIND WOMAN is
shuffling across the street, Les is forced to go up ons:

THE SIDEWALK

Boxed in by parked cars, the Caddie bombs through Sunday
papers and Sunday morning brunch tables. A WAITER putting a
RED tablecloth down on a table dives out of the way, like a
Matador teasing a bull. The Caddie flies through the
tablecloth.

A MOTORCYCLE COP ACROSS THE STREET

writing out a parking ticket, drops his pencil when he sees
the Caddie crash down off the sidewalk onto the street
joining the traffic. The Cop jumps on his motorcycle,
switches on his siren, and rockets away.

WITH THE CADDIE

weaving in and out of traffic: left turns, right turns, it's

incredible. We hear the SIREN. The Cop pulls up beside Les,
waving for him to pull over.

(CONTINUED )
115.
CONTINUED:

Dad tries to signal to the Cop that Mom's pregnant. The Cop
realizes what's going on. He waves for Les to "follow him,"
but he hasn't been looking ahead. Suddenly, his front tire
hits the back bumper of an ANTIQUE CONVERTIBLE. The Cop
somersaults over his handle bars into the car's front seat.

The DRIVER, a red-nosed Irishman, does a double-take, takes a
leck at the flask he's been nipping on, smiles, and takes
another swig.

BACK WITH THE CADDIE

bulleting down the street. The hospital is in sight. Les
has to catch a yellow light. A WATER MAIN has burst.
There's a HUGE PUDDLE. IN REVERSE, Les rockets through the
light. Here comes the puddle... Has he learned his lesson?

INSIDE THE CADDIE

Les eases his foot off the brake and coasts through. Spray
shoots out on either side, and SPLASHES through the back
window, soaking Mom and Dad. Rudy loves it. Dad alternates
between caring for Mom and fearing for his life.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Down the street from the hospital. Natalie leaves the
precinct. She does a triple-take when she sees her family
flash by backwards. She runs after them.

SUDDENLY!!!

A HUGE TRUCK backs out of a SKYSCRAPER CONSTRUCTION SITE. A
TOWERING CRANE attempts to lift a HEAVY LOAD OF STEEL GIRDERS
from the truck's flatbed. The girders hang out onto the
street...

The Caddie's headed straight for them. We hear a SCREECH!

EXT. CADILLAC - CLOSE ON THEIR FACES IN THE BACK WINDOW

Horror, as there's nothing they can do, except pray... ten
feet, five feet, a foot... Les swoops the car safely around
the girders and then screeches to a stop in a tow zone, in
front of the hospital. The emergency driveway is clogged.
Natalie runs to the car.

TWO ORDERLIES dash out to the car with a WHEELCHAIR. Dad
helps Mom out. Rudy and Natalie watch. Les stays in the
car. They rush Mom up the walk into the hospital. Dad looks
back. Les is standing by the destroyed Caddie, ashamed.

(CONTINUED )
116.
CONTINUED:

DAD
(stern)
Come here, Les.

Les looks down.

DAD
Les. Come here!

Les sheepishly makes his way over. Dad puts his arm around
him.

DAD
Where did you learn to drive like
that?

LES
(relieved)
I don't know, Dad. TI guess last
night.

DAD
It must have been some crash
course.

Les laughs. Dad squeezes him, affectionately. The CAMERA
CRANES UP TO a bird's-eye view, high above the scene. Dad,
with his arm around his son, disappears into the hospital.

DAD
(voice over)
Maybe we can fix the car before
Grandfather gets home. He'll never
notice.

Suddenly, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS begin shouting, and then
running for cover, scattering like ants. From the sky:

THE WHOLE BUNCH OF GIRDERS

CRASH down on Grandfather's Cadillac, DEMOLISHING it.

As the dust settles, the CAMERA CRAWLS its way into the heap
of junk until we CAN BARELY MAKE OUT the radio-tape deck. We
hear a click-click. The tape starts to play... Sinatra

"That's Life..."

FADE OUT
