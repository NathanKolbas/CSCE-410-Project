"DICK AND JANE"

FADE IN:
CLOSEUP OF A FADED SCHOOL BOOK

lying closed on an old-fashioned wooden teaching lectern.
We are ANGLED DOWN so all we can see is a piece of the
mec rese and the TITLE of the book (also the title of our
movie)...

"DICK AND JANE"

The book miraculously opens by itself and, as a nostalgic
version of "SCHOOL DAYS" PLAYS OVER, the pages quickly
unfold the back story of Dick and Jane and the names and
titles of the people who make this movie. The whole style
of the opening should be a kind of kiddy-version of those
"Book Openings'' to old MGM movies. Like this...

MUSIC AND TITLES CONTINUE. We blow open to the first page
where the story begins. This page is labeled, "DICK" at
the bottom and the picture on the page is of a young boy
of about ten sitting under a tree reading "IVANHOE." In
the background is a large, comfortable house. (NOTE: All
the pictures in the book are in that romanticized and naive
style unique to the Dick and Jane Series. But we shall
use the real childhood photos of our stars, Jane Fonda and
George Segal.)

Another page turns and we SEE a picture of Dick's father,
a rugged but gentle, distinguished but earthy, fun but
serious, neat but casual guy, standing on the front porch
of the house holding a football and shouting to his son,
Dick, who has. dropped his book and is looking eagerly at
his father. Beneath the picture are these words... *

"LOOK, DICK," SAID DICK'S
FATHER. ."LOOK WHAT I HAVE."

Another page blows open. The ball has been thrown and
Dick is running after it. Caption...

"RUN, DICK, RUN."

CLOSEUP ON THE BOOK

Another page turns and we SEE Dick, now in a high school
football uniform and helmet, running to catch a pass.
This picture is captioned... .

"SEE DICK RUN."

MONTAGE SEQUENCE

as we SEE DICK running through various stages of his life,
years 15 through 19. He is in constant motion; running to
classes, delivering newspapers, running for class office,
running in every known.sporting activity, running with his
friends after a group of giggling girls. Beneath all this
is the caption...

"RUN, DICK; RUN.
RUN, RUN, RUN."

CLOSEUP OF THE BOOK

as another page blows open and we SEE a picture of a darling
little girl in pigtails sitting on her pretty bed. Outside
her window stands a magnolia tree complete with a chirping
robin. | The girl is reading "IVANHOE." This picture is
abeled...

"JANE"
A page turns and the next picture is of Jane's mother coming
in the room with a big wrapped present as Jane's eyes light
up. Jane's mother is an even more wholesome-looking person
than Dick's father. This picture is captioned... =

"LOOK, JANE," SAID JANE'S

MOTHER. "LOOK WHAT I

HAVE FOR YOU."
INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - DAY
JANE opens the gift her MOTHER has given her.. It's a play
tea set. Jane's Mother begins showing her how to set up
the tea things on the bed, shoving the book aside.

MONTAGE SEQUENCE

briefly fleshing out Jane's junior high and high school
years...which seem to be one long whirl of fun. We SEE
Jane dancing with a boy, trying to study in a class but
succumbing to the flirting of a boy behind her, jumping

up in a cheer-leader costume (great legs), taking a home-ec
class, sleeping at a slumber party that is suddenly attacked
by a group of boys, etc. UNDER THESE DISSOLVES the same
legend remains constant...

"PLAY, JANE, PLAY.
PLAY, PLAY, PLAY."

CLOSE ON THE BOOK

Many pages blow by as MUSIC AND TITLES CONTINUE. The
miraculous breeze stops at a page titled:

"DICK AND JANE
GO TO COLLEGE."

ABOVE THIS TITLE is an idealized picture of a college
(imposing and friendly). Eager students approach this
citadel of learning from different paths. Easily discern-
ible are Dick and Jane, coming from different directions.

MORE QUICK CUTS

Dick's college life. _We SEE him in various classes, most
of them centering on aerospace and related mathematical
subjects. In the brief snatches of non-classroom life
(playing ball, trying out for a play), he seems happier.
BENEATH all this ACTION:

"DICK WORKS HARD. DICK
WORKS HARD TO GET GOOD
GRADES AND GET A GOOD JOB."

QUICK CUTS - JANE'S COLLEGE LIFE

Pretty much the same as Dick, only her classes are more
liberal-artsy and she seems to have a much easier time
of it, getting good grades, helping others study, but
goofing off really more than Dick and going out with a
lot of different boys.

"JANE WORKS HARD. JANE
WORKS HARD TO GET GOOD

GRADES AND GET A GOOD
HUSBAND."

CLOSEUP OF THE PICTURE BOOK

This picture shows a very 1950's collegiate Dick and Jane
bumping into each other backstage at an auditorium. The -

"DICK AND JANE MEET."

ANGLE ON THE BOOK

Pages blow, finally fall open on an evening scene of a
beautiful lake with two big trees framing both sides of
the peaceful moonlit scene. A 1956 Ford is parked at a
perfect vista spot. This is a PUZZLE PAGE and the trees
are drawn in such a way that it's possible to image faces
in them. This picture is captioned:

between cars, the lot somewhat less than half-filled.

leather attache case, emerges from car, strides toward

executives, he sees a Mexican worker lazily painting out

Good luck. I've just been

Secretary sadly looks up as Dick strides past, into office
of Gharlie Sanford, Corporate Vice-President of Dixon Air-
Craft.

INT. SANFORD'S OFFICE DAY

Dick comes in to discover Sanford sitting on a leather couch
with his coat off, his feet propped up on coffee table, a
drink in hand. Charlie is a big athletic looking man, fifty,
with a lot of silver hair. His walls are lined with framed
signed photographs of astronauts, military brass, cabinet
ministers. :

SANFORD
Dick...Sit down and pour
yourself a drink.

DICK
Thanks, Charlie.

Dick pours himself a drink.

SANFORD
This business stinks.
You know that?

_ DICK
Well...

CHARLIE
To know the feeling that you've
been a part of the team that tied
the lace on the shoe that took
that giant step for mankind. You
don't get that from building a
goddamn missile. It stinks. It
used to be the most exciting
business in the world, and now it
stinks on ice.

DICK
It's been a rough year.

CHARLIE
It stinks.

DICK
I guess it does stink.

CHARLIE
It stinks on ice,

~ DICK
On ice, Right.

What's all this crap?

He's referring to Dick's stack of papers, charts, etc.

DICK
It's my plan to re-organize
my department. I figure...

CHARLIE (interrupting)
One small step. One giant
step for mankind...

DICK
Oh I wouldn't say that. But it's
not a bad plan, I ----

CHARLIE
You know who made that step
possible? We did. You and me -
and Bob Kane and Marty Fields.
We put Neil and whats-his-name
on the fucking moon and then
they gave us the shaft. It stinks.

DICK
On ice.

CHARLIE
Goddamn right it does.

Charlie finishes his drink, pours himself another.

CHARLIE
How's you drink?

» DICK
Fine,

CHARLIE .
Well...What do you say we talk

In response, Dick begins to arrange his papers in front of him.

Charlie...?

CHARLIE
Dick, I've always felt you
were a guy I didn't have to
bullshit.

DICK ,
I'm glad to hear that.

CHARLIE :
In this job you have to bullshit
a lot of guys, give 'em the old
stroke...you know...But I've always
felt I could level with you. You
know what I mean?

DICK
Sure.
CHARLIE
Can I level with you?
DICK
_ Sure.
CHARLIE

I mean really level?

DICK
..,@harlie, you can tell me anything.

 

CHARLIE
You're fired.

Charlie breaks up. Dick laughs too, uneasily.
CHARLIE
I never once said it straight
out like that.

DICK (laughing)
. Practice makes perfect.

But Charlie is suddenly depressed.

CHARLIE
No, I shouldn't have done that. It's
just that I'm sick of all the bullshit.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...

DICK
Wait a minute... you're serious?

CHARLIE (hurt)
Would I kid a pal?

DICK
No jokes, Charlie. You're really
firing me?

Charlie tries to salvage a little of his corporate manner.

CHARLIE
I don't have to tell you. this has been
a rough year for us...

DICK
But I haven't done a bad job.

» CHARLIE
You've done a helluva job. Don't let
anybody tell you different. Shit, you
know how I feel about you and Jane.

‘ DICK .
Then why me? Why not Marty or Bob?
My division's out-performed both of
theirs.

CHARLIE (vague)
Seniority...I think that's what it was

alee vores yyseniority. I'm sure that's what it

was. Yeah...

*, ~ DICK
I can't believe it.

The high point of Charlie's drunk has faded and now he is
verging on the nod.

CHARLIE
Listen, Dick, do you mind if we don't
go into all this crap now? Frankly, I'ma
little looped and... I've got blood on my
hands...a lot of blood... .

Cunningly, he now feigns sleep. Dick just stands there
for a moment, glaring at him, uncertain. Finally, he
gathers his papers and leaves.

Isn't that thoughtful?

ELEANOR (obsequious smile)
And we will continue to pay your
membership in the country club until the
end of the quarter, but we must have
your company credit cards now, please.

A beat; even as she holds out her hand.
DICK
Damn it, they're in my other suit.
I'll bring them round tomorrow.

. You got guts. I give you that.

DICK
Your ad says if you've been
turned down elsewhere...

NED
It didn't say if you've been turned
down everywhere.

DICK
This is the first place we've been.
NED
Lucky us.
"JANE

Listen, we can go lots of places for
abuse. C'mon, Dick.

NED
Sit down. Did I say I wasn't goin;
to give you money? Did I say that?

DICK
No. I just...

NED :
Sit down. Let's look at the pluses
and the minuses,

CONTINUED:

DICK
There are a couple of...

. NED (cutting him off)
We'll start with the minuses. You're
in hock up to your eyes. And you got
nothing serious for collateral. You're
behind on both mortgages which makes us
third in line after the bank, Your car
is paid for but that and a dime will get
you a cup of coffee.

DICK
That is a perfectly good late model
ear that's worth at least 1,000 dollars.

A grunt from Ned on this.
NED
You got some jewelry which might be
worth a few bucks.

DICK
That car's worth at least nine hundred,

Ned shoots him a disgusted Look.
NED
I haven't come to the pluses yet.
Wait for the pluses.

DICK
O.K..

NED
On the plus side, you're actually

v working....

This last to Jane who brightens a touch.

: NED
You're getting paid bupkas, but you're
working. It's regular.

(to Dick)

You could get another job. Who knows. .
They might even find a cure for cancer.
Next year the Kings could win the Stanley
Cup. Nixon could come back. We're also due
for an earthquake. It's a wonderful world
we live in. Right? Right? :

CONTINUED: oo, 49,

: DICK
Actually, there are a couple of things
starting to break,

NED
Anyway, the biggest thing you got going
for you is.stupidity, which is to say you
have a history of paying your debts. And
me, I love people. I can let you have a
thousand dollars for one year at eighteen
and a half compounded...

DICK
A thousand!?

JANE
Eighteen and a half. That's against the
law.

NED

Take itor leave it.

. , SANE
We'll take it.

NED
You had me worried there for a moment.

INT. LOAN OFFICE - LATER |

Dick and Jane are at the cashier area, They have completed signing
all the forms and they are getting their money, At this moment,
two men burst through the front door carrying large guns.

FIRST ROBBER
This is a hold up! If nobody moves,
nobody gets hurt. Everybody lie down
on the floor.

: NED
I thought you said nobody move.

FIRST ROBBER
Just lie down and shut up.

CONTINUED: : 50.

NED
I will do nothing to offend. Count on it.

ROBBER
I told you to shut up.

Ned lies down and shuts up with the rest of the people. One
robber goes behind the counter and begins collecting the money out
of the till. The other one collects from the customers lying on
the floor. Dick is the first one, He is clutching a thousand
dollars in cash. As the robber reaches for it.

DICK
Hey, look, I just borrowed this.

ROBBER
Now, you're loaning it.

Dick slides the money to Ned.

 

DICK
Borrow it from him,

NED
That money is legally yours. You :
signed the papers. |

Ned pushes it back to Dick.
DICK
I'm paying it back. What's the interest

on two minutes?

ROBBER
Shut up.

He grabs the money.
DICK .
Could we just clear this up? : 4
Who are you stealing this from? : :

ROBBER
Shut up.

He whacks Dick on the hand with the butt of the shotgun which causes
it to fire, This startled everybody but most of all the robbers.

SECOND ROBBER
What the hell was that?

CONTINUED:

FIRST ROBBER
It was me. My gun went off.

SECOND ROBBER
Shit, that'll bring all the heat in
the world, Come on, lets get out
of here.

He comes out from behind the counter carrying a bag full of
money. We HEAR a siren in the distance. He stops and speaks
to the nearest person who happens to be Jane.

ROBBER
O.K. lady. On your feet. You're
coming with us.

DICK
Hey, wait a .....

He is interrupted by a gun butt over the head. Jane instinctively
moves toward him but is grabbed by the robber and hauled along
with him toward a back door. Jane is pushed out ahead of them.

As the door closes behind them, the front door bursts open -

and the cops.come racing in.

"NED
They went out the back.

ANOTHER CUSTOMER
They've got a woman with them.

The cops race through the office to the back door.

EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY

The rear of the loan company opens énto a vacant lot. As the
cops come out of the rear door we SEE Jane on the ground about
twenty feet from the door. One of the robbers is racing for
a waiting car the other who is a few feet away from Jane

seems to be about to go back and get her. His attention is
diverted by the cops. He races for the car after firing a
shot at the cops. The cops pursue, firing, running by Jane.
However, the robbers make it to their car and take off. The
cops fire a few shots without any noticable effect.. Jane

gets up and goes back inside.

INT. LOAN COMPANY

Dick is just coming around. Jane comes back in to attend
to him.

JANE

JANE

They start to leave. Ned stops them before they get to the door,

, NED (confidentially)
How much did you tell 'em you lost?

DICK (puzzled)
A thousand dollars, What do you mean?

NED
: ae ak Schmuck, You couldn't have told 'em

paid and I'd have split the extra grand
with you.

alarmed. Jane. does look distraught. :

DICK
What's the matter?

She opens her purse, takes out a thick wad of hundred dollar
bills, and drops it on the counter in front of Dick. It's fair
to say Dick is surprised.

JANE
He dropped it and I fell on it and
while they were chasing him I just
stuck it in my purse. I don't know
what happened to me, but I just did it.

Dick has been examining the money through this.

DICK
There's two thousand dollars here. ,

JANE
I can't bélieve I did it.

Dick starts to laugh.

DICK
Neither can I,

JANE

Have you eaten yet, Mr. Johnson?

JOHNSON (icily)
Yes. Thank you.

DICK

JOHNSON
Don't I?

Jane pours herself a much-needed glass of wine.
JANE
Yeah, the truth is we just happened to
knock off a loan company yesterday, and
this feast is the last of the proceeds.
Dick dives for the wine himself.

As Billy, frightened, begins to cry.

Don't thank me, As far as I can see it's
people like you who give this program a bad
name, and screw it up for the people who
really need it. But you're eligible.

DICK
Just a minute...

JANE
We really need it...you just saw...

JOHNSON
Nobody living in this house and this

You know why that bastard stuck it to us?
Because we're the nouveau poor. The old
rich are always sticking it to the new rich.
I guess there's no reason why thé old poor
shouldn't stick it to the nouveau poor.

. JANE
Well, I agreed with a lot of what he said,

DICK
What, all that crap about our middleclass
pretension, Shit, we're barely hanging in
there.

JANE
I'm sorry, but that's probably what it
looks like compared to the people he
usually sees.

DICK :
Oh, really? I suppose you think we should
sell the house and move to Watts, where we
belong.

JANE
I think we should sell the house before the

bank sells it for us. Which will be, next week.

roast beef away from him.

DICK
This is a stick up!

Apparently not satisfied with his performance or his appearance,
or both, he pulls a nylon stocking over his head. Actually,
it's pantyhose which makes him look like a rabbit. It also
makes him barely intelligible.

DICK (muffled)
_ This is a stick up. .

Jane enters the room and watches him for a moment. She wears
a coat and carries her purse. Dick has another go at the
mirror trying for greater clarity of speech.

DICK
This is a stick up.

A little clearer.

J
Are you kidding?

Startled, Dick spins around gun momentarily pointed at Jane
who jumps for cover. Dick shouts something at her which is
incomprehensible due to the stocking mask. ~

JANE
Are you crazy?

Dick answers but we still don't get it.

" JANE
Will you take that ridiculous thing
off? I can't understand a word
you're saying.

Dick removes the stocking.
