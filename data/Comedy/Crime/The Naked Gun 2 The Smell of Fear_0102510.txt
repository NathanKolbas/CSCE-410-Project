himself to the other guests. Finally, Mrs. Bush is on

the room. ° :

RESUME SCENE 36

BUSH
Please be seated.

Frank pulls the chair out for a pretty lady. Unfor-
tunately it is the chair Barbara Bush is about to sit
on. She falls backwards, grabbing onto the tablecloth
and taking a lot of the dishes, candles, and flowers
with her. Frank goes to her aid. But ends up hitting
heads with a Secret Service man. Barbara is being
helped up by COMMISSIONER BROMPORD As she bends
forward to get to her feet, Frank picks up two candles
which are now unlit. The timing is just right... that
is... just real bad for Commissioner Bruaford Frank
pokes her in the eyes with the candles. Frank is real
sorry. But manages to poke a woman in the rear end
with the candle. A Secret Service man wrestles the
candles from Frank's hand. Order is now quickly
restored. Servants have miraculously straightened the
table out. Everyone is seated. Frank is seated
between Barbara Bush and Commissioner Brumford.

BUSH
As you all know, this is Law
Enforcement Week across the

the proceedings over to our own
Washington, D.C. Police
Commissioner, Captain Annabelle
Brunford.

She rises to acknowledge a nice applause.

BRUMFORD
Thank you, Mr. President. I'a
like now to introduce a most
distinguished American. This
week, he's being honored for his
one thousandth drug dealer killed.
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Lieutenant Frank Drebin of

Nice applause. _ Frank rises to acknowledge applause.

FRANK

(humbly)
I should point out -- the last
two I backed over with my car.

She looks at him, blankly. Commissioner Brumford,
overhearing this, glares at Frank, appalled. She
slowly sinks back into her chair.

the American R and B group, Martha

given an enormous lobster... a ten-pounder... he's
fitted with a bib. Frank doesn't quite know where to

years this adninistration has been
trying to formulate a National
Energy Policy, one that will have
‘a lasting impact on the way we

Frank is wrestling with pulling the meat out of the

claw. Unwittingly, he has maneuvered the second claw

into position just below Commissioner Brunford's right
breast. When Frank moves one claw, the other one snaps
open and closed, with exbarrassing results. She tries

to avoid the aggressive claw to no avail. *

SUNUNU
As I'm sure you're all aware, his
reputation in this field is without
peer, and Dr. Meinheimer will
present his recommendations at the
annual National Press Club Dinner on
Tuesday evening. Mr. President?

energy policy on Dr. Meinheimer's

Frank walks down a lonely street, a MATTE SHOT of the
Capitol in the b.g. The SONG "Only the Lonely" plays
to UNDERSCORE his sadness. As he walks, he passes by
loving couples holding hands. One couple, then two,
three, ten, then a horde of lovers. Frank makes his
way through them and is almost crushed as he does. He
can't understand where everyone is coming from. He
walks past a statue of Rodin's "The Kiss." There
seems to be an endless supply of lovers. In the heat
of passion, a woman rips her lover's toupee off and
throws it away. Frank passes by two army cots on the
sidewalk with lovers under the covers. A couple lies
on the hood of a car and necks passionately. Now the
sidewalk is littered with couples. Frank has to
carefully pick his way through it all. Even a
department store window bedroom display has a man and
woman in the heat of mad passion. Frank walks
forlornly THROUGH FRAME, past the Statue of Liberty.

the gun away from him. Jane opens the curtain to see
what's going on.

JANE - OVER THE SHOULDER 203

Naked, of course. The two men struggle. She screams.
She's naked, remember. Don't forget that. This is a
nude woman from the back. When she screams, Savage and
Frank turn toward her. Both stop dead in their tracks.
Staring at her. Taking her all in. Both enjoying what
they see. Then it's back to the struggle. Savage has
Frank bent over the sink. He's attempting to do him in
with an electric toothbrush. CLOSEUP of Frank's
struggle. The brush getting closer to his mouth.

Then, as Frank struggles, the toothbrush glides over
his teeth. Frank reacts as if this were pure torture.
His mouth foaming up with toothpaste. Frank grabs a
hair dryer. Turns it ON, blows hot air in Savage's
face. Savage holds his face and screams. As Frank
recovers from his brushing, Savage throws a towel at
him, momentarily blinding Frank, while Savage runs out
of the room. Frank, mouth billowing in toothpaste,
goes after him.

Frank catches up to the fleeing Savage with a flying
tackle. The elevator doors open, revealing an elderly
lady with a poodle. Frank and Savage end up on the
ground with their heads: between the elevator doors,
which keep jamming closed on their heads. The poodle
yaps annoyingly at their heads. They both get up, a
little woozy. Savage chokes Frank up against the wall
with one hand and pulls a gun with the other. In
desperation, Frank grabs a nearby fire hose, from a
typical wall-mounted box. Frank manages to shove the
hose nozzle into his attacker's mouth. Savage keeps
up his attack. Frank turns on the water. Holds the
nozzle in Savage's mouth. Savage immediately lets go
of Frank. His cheeks bulging out with water. They
look like two water balloons. Then his stomach begins
to fill up. Frank sees the man has had enough. But
he's shoved the hose too far down Savage's throat. He
can't yank it out. Frank quickly goes to turn the
water off. But the handle comes off in his hand, "Oh,
oh." Savage continues filling with water.
