EXTERIOR - NIGHT

Pan down from clock on side of bank. The clock reads 4:00 AM
A young boy wearing an applejack hat and knickers is running
down the sidewalk carrying a paper bag. The streets are wet
and empty. He turns up an alley and midway through knocks on
a door. We see the peep hole open. An eye looks straight out
and squints with bewilderment, then looks down and sees the
young boy. The peep hole shuts and the door opens. The boy
walks in and looks up at a huge black man who's looking down
at him with an unpleasant scowl.

BOY

arguing. An overweight hooker sits on a stool chewing gum and
staring at the boy. A drunk man is asleep and snoring quite
loudly in the corner. Despite the surroundings, there's more
of a look of amazement than} fear in the boy's eyes. He pusnes
aside the makeshift felt culrtain at the end of the hall and
walks into a small, smake-flilled room.

The boy makes his way thooke the dark where some men pass by

We see RAY'S hand reaching under the table, but the man
is holding him too tight and) he can't reach “the gun"

he keeps stuck under the tablle in case of shit like this.
(The boy sees the gun and knows the deal.)

He feels the edge of the mechanism that holds the gun up,
thinking he's within reach. |

iRAY
But, before yau stick me, I wanna
tell you something.

His hand is groping for the/jgun that's not there. He gets
a confused look in his eyes,

TOOTHLESS
Yeah, what's that.

We hear the sound of a bangjand a bullet hole appears in
the middle of TOOTHLESS’ forehead, who's face is right
next to RAY'S. He stares, in shock, at the person who
shot him.

We see the young boy standing there, gun in hand, still
smoking. TOOTHLESS falls tp the floor. RAY is in shock
as well.

RAY
I guess he does have bad luck
with kids.

RAY calls to the old man inf the corner.
RAY

BENNIE nods yes. He's staring at the kid as well.

him out.

The door blasts open and a woman about sixty years old comes
marching into the room. She’s dressed to the "T", and
although she’s quite hippy and weighs at least 200 pounds,

she’ can take it. The two box and exchange blows. The guys

are cheering. VERA starts to get the best of QUICK. Combination

jumps on top of him to beat him some more, while still talking.
This is one tough old lady. While sitting on QUICK'S chest,

she accents every sentence with a punch.

VERA

QUICK finds the lid to a garbage can, which is right next to

rolls off him and gets up. He picks up the garbage can and

He steps quickly around the corner to find a middle-aged white

CANTONE
Hello, Raymond. How are you?
My name is Sargeant Phil Cantone.

RAY
What are you doing in my place?

CANTONE
I needed to speak with you, Ray.
And I know you wouldn't want me
standing around outside in this
neighborhood. I mean a fella
could get hurt around here. And,
please, put the gun away, Ray.
Colored guys with guns make me
Nervous.

RAY (playing along)
How can I help you Mr. Cantone?

CANTONE
Jesus...that's a beautiful suit.
What is that...Macy's?

RAY pours a drink and has a seat
RAY
No. This is tailor made, to order
Tf you'd like, I'll give you his

CANTONE is a disheveled mess.

Nope. I've been in the candy
business for the past twenty

years.
CANTONE

Candy business. Are you serious?
RAY

Twenty years.
CANTONE

Well, that's strange. ‘Cause
somebody told me you run an after-
hours place called Club Sugar Ray's...
hottest spot in Harlem. Told me

you could gamble, drink, fuck,

dance, everything there. And that
you owned the place. Aren't you

that Sugar Ray?

RAY
No, sir. I own a Sweet shop.

CANTONE

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm in the wrong
place. I thought you were a
different Sugar Ray. Oh well...
a candy store, huh? That's just
great. So you live in a great
place like this and wear tailor
made suits from selling candy.

That's right. Candy business

I guess he wants to own all of ‘em.
But this kind of shit happens all

relocate.
ANNIE
Baby, I don't wanna leave New York.
RAY
Me neither, but we can't fuck with
Calhoune.

A big man walks into the restaurant with a beautiful woman

patrons yells out.

PATRON

The restaurant breaks out in applause. The big man is

JACK JENKINS, the heavyweight champion of the world. He's

out for a night on the town. He waves to everyone and notices

bad stuttering problem.

got ts Smalls coming by the club
and a cop comin' to your house.
And we already got your bags
packed. That cop might not even
be working for Calhoune.

ANNIE
He's right, baby. Maybe it's all
just a coincidence.

QUICK
Besides, leaving New York should
be a last resort. I ain't afraid
of going up against Smalls or
Calhoune.

RAY
Well, that's because you're young
and full of life and vigor and...
ignorant, Because Calhoune don't
give a fuck about nobody and can
have your ass killed by popping
his fingers.

QuIcK
I don't think so.

RAY
You better slow down man. There's
a whole nother world outside Sugar
Hill. And we are the very, very
little league. And the only way
we stay in the game is not mess
with nobody. And when the big
league wants to play where you
been playin'...you just find another
place to play.

build up a market, just so somebody
can come along and put us out...
especially when all this shit is
illegal. I'm just not afraid of
Calhoune. I mean...shit. I gota
gun too.

RAY
Yeah. But he got his gun and his
boys have their guns and his cops
have their guns. And he got judges
on the payroll. And all you got
is your gun. That's about 100
people with guns against you and
your gun. Now I know you think
you's a bad motherfucker, but don't
that make you feel a little uncom-
fortable?

It's not how many you shoot. It's
who you shoot.

won't make that much. Everybody

Kirkpatrick.

CANTONE
Yeah, I know, but they're not
betting on Jenkins. They put
the money on Kirkpatrick at
three-to-~one they can make
six hundred grand if he wins.

CALHOUNE (having a revelation)

Those sneaky bastards, they put
the fix on. Jenkins is gonna
throw the fight.

CANTONE
It makes sense.

CALHOUNE
Of course, it makes sense. They
know Jenkins. He knows if he
loses the fight he can get a re-
match. They take all the money
they got, put it on Jenkins to
lose, make six hundred thousand
and disappear. Jenkins gets his
rematch, gets his title back and
helps out his buddies as well. ~
Jesus, ain't the champ a wonderful
guy (laughing at himself).

CANTONE
So, what do you do now?

CALHOUNE
Well, I don't see why they should
be the only ones to benefit from
Mr. Jenkins' generosity. So what
I'm gonna do is put about five
hundred thousand on Kirkpatrick
and pick up a little extra cash
(Taughing at himself still). And
IT suggest you put all your extra
cash together and do the same thing.

Bugsy follows the path of the wire until it reappears from under
the rug and leads to the doorjamb.

ANGLE ON DOOR

Bugsy sees that the door is rigged, not the phone. At that
moment Leoni comes back into the room and closes the door.

BUGSY
(terrified)
No! Don’t close...
Leoni closes the door before Bugsy can warn him.

SUGAR

minds yet. i
WILLIE .

Well, listen man, I’m going south.
Let me give you a number...

SUGAR
No man, no numbers. I don’t wanna
know where any of y’all are...case
anybody needs to find you. Are you
hip?

WILLIE
(understanding)
Yeah man, I’m hip. Hey man, y’all take
care of yourselves.

Off camera we hear VERA’s voice.

VERA
Sugar, let’s go!

SUGAR
I’m comin’.

He gives his friend a pound (slaps him five) and Willie drives
off.

SUGAR walks over to his car. BENNIE and QUICK and the WHITE COPS
are standing on the driver’s side. VERA is walking up from the
hotel bickering. ANNIE is in the back seat.

SUGAR
(to white cops,
shaking their hands)
Thanks a lot guys. Don’t spend
it all in one place.

WHITE COPS walk off.

VERA
Shit. Let’s get moving y’all,
before somebody comes limping
up here looking for us.

QUICK and BENNIE are looking at the New York skyline from where

they're standing. At this point, BENNIE, QUICK, SUGAR and VERA
are all standing by open car doors.

: SUGAR (looking at the city)
I'm sure gonna miss that place. Y'all
know we can't never come back.

QUICK
New York ain't the only city in the
world. We'll just start all over again.

RAY
Yeah, but there ain't nothin' like
Harlem.

BENNIE

You ain't lying, Sugar. (turning around)
Let me look at it one more time.

VERA (Getting in the car)
Don't waste your time. Get your
blind ass in the car.

BENNIE (getting in the car)
Bitch, I'll kick your ass.

We hear BENNIE and VERA bickering

QUICK (to Ray)
So where you wanna go, Pop?

RAY
Well son, we got a tank full of gas...

QUICK
And a trunk full of money. That sounds
like a sweet combination to me.

RAY
Yep, sweet as sugar....

They exchange smiles, get in the car, and head down the highway
as we roll credits and go to the mother fuckin' bank.
