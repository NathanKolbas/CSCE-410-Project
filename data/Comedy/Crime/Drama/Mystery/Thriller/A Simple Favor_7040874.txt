WHITE PRODUCTION DRAFT: JULY 10, 2017
A COMPUTER SCREEN - INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 1

A YouTube page awaiting a live streaming vlog to start, the
screen blank. On the right side of the screen is a COMMENTS
SECTION. COMMENTS are being written in quick succession:

TigerMom217: Any word about Emily?

Yogalover999: Have you heard anything?
Lives2Zumba: Is Emi okay?

MomPowerl4: My kids loved your bundt cake recipe!
NinjaMom911: PLEASE TELL US EMILY’S NOT DEAD!!!!!

 

The screen pops on, revealing STEPHANIE SMOTHERS, a cute,
conservative, earnest young mother and mommy blogger. She’s
in a modest country kitchen with a cozy feel. There’s a
child’s art work on the refrigerator behind her.

On the counter in front of Stephanie are her cookie
ingredients: flour, brown sugar, chocolate chips, zucchini,
measuring cups, mixing bowls, spatula, pan.

STEPHANIE

Hi, Moms. Stephanie here. As promised,
today I’1ll be sharing my secret recipe
for zucchini chocolate chip cookies. Your
kids will never know they’re eating a
full serving of veggies. But first --

(her voice shifts, grave)
-- many of you have asked for an update
on the Emily situation. For those of you
new to my vlog ...

(checking computer screen)
That’s you, Babette9 and VioletsRblue,
thanks for joining ... You should know
that my best friend Emily is missing. She
asked me for a simple favor: to pick up
her son Nicky from school. That was nine
days ago. She hasn’t come back yet ...

(voice breaks; regroups)
I hope you'll forgive me. I’m just so
worried about her. And I want to help the
police track her down. But I’m realizing
I didn’t know her as well as I thought.
Like my mother used to say, God rest her
soul, “Secrets are like margarine. Easy
to spread, but bad for the heart.” But as
different as we were, I truly considered
Emily my best friend. Our sons brought us
together. She’s such a wonderful, elegant
person ...

She clears a tear, then composes herself.
STEPHANIE (CONT’D
I’m sorry, for all our new friends, let
me catch you up. I met Emily a few weeks
ago at school ...

EXT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 2

 

Hammering rain falls on a quaint Connecticut ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL. It pings onto the abandoned gungle gym and swing
sets, an ominous crack of lightning hrough the bars. A VOLVO

STATION WAGON drives alone through the torrent.
STEPHANIE (POST-LAP
It was International Cuisine day in my
son Miles’ 2nd Grade class and, once
again, I drew Sweden.

EXT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 3

 

Trying to juggle an UMBRELLA, PHOTO EQUIPMENT, and the
HATCHBACK, Stephanie fights to extract the TRAY OF SWEDISH
MEATBALLS (each adorned with a miniature flag). She can’t
quite pull it off and spills a few onto the pavement.

STEPHANIE
Oh, nuts.

She turns and races toward the school, splashing through
puddles in her TALBOTS SKY BLUE MOCCASINS.

INT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY - KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM - LATER 4

 

The tray of meatballs has now been eaten, paper flags dead in
puddles of cold gravy. They sit on a table with other
remnants of a consumed international pot luck.

On the ground, blocks, dinosaurs - two boys have made an
alternate universe, which they now demolish with toy trucks.
MILES SMOTHERS (5) is a shy kid with the alert eyes of his
mother. NICKY (5) is a rambunctious towhead, ready for
trouble. Miles both admires and fears his aggression.

NICKY
You're all dead! I killed everyone.
Miles retrieves his LEGO MAN from the wreckage, upbeat.

MILES
Not me. I came back to life.

Below a banner that reads “Ethnic Food Day” sit the spent
parents: STACY (30s, cardigan and culottes), SONA (30s, East
indian), DARREN (40, put together) dandling his toddler LULU.

MRS. KERRY
I want to thank everyone who participated
in today’s feast. vay! Class, didn’t we
learn so much about food from around the
world? Give your parents a big hand.

The distracted kids CLAP as the parents nod. FREEZE FRAME:
The parents look with dread at the lens. REVERSE ON -

Stephanie, decked out like a WAR CORRESPONDENT with photo
gear. She checks her video display, not loving the shot.

STEPHANIE
Oh, shoot. The lighting was pretty bad.

STACY
Just set it to Auto.

STEPHANIE
What’s the fun in that? All right,
everybody look like you’re having fun!
3.

qhey stare ahead like MUG SHOTS and she snaps another. As she
heads off to get more action shots, the parents talk:

SONA,
How can she still have energy?

DARREN
There must be crystal meth in those
meatballs.

MRS. KERRY, the teacher, calls over to the group of parents:

MRS. KERRY
And parents, don’t forget, there's a sign-
up sheet on the board for our Easter egg
hunt next week. Please, Stephanie, don
sign up for more than one job.

Stephanie looks caught as she starts to ERASE the first two
of her FOUR SIGNATURES she’s just written on the sign-up
sheets.

MRS. KERRY (CONT'D)
I’m not sure everyone has gotten a chance
to volunteer yet.

Stephanie glances over at Nicky, angrily smashing his block
creation with a truck.

STEPHANIE
Miles, honey? Maybe keep your fingers
away from Nicky’s truck.

MRS. KERRY
Has Nicky’s Mom volunteered?

SONA’S DAUGHTER has come over and lay across Sona’s knees,
limp as a sack of apples.

DARREN
(incredulous)
Emily? Please. I don’t think she knows
it's Easter. She’s in the city 24/7.

STACY
God, it’d be my dream to run PR_ for
Dennis Nylon. Can you imagine all the
free shit she must get? The parties? I'd
kill for one night of her life.

Sona struggles to keep her daughter from falling on her head.

SONA
I would miss my kids too much. Honey, sit
up. This game is hurting Mommy’s knees.

DARREN
(baby voice, to his Lulu)
Sona’s right, Lulu! You’d miss Daddy if
he worked in the Big City, wouldn’t you?

He fart-kisses her cheek, then her stomach. She laughs.
4.

Stephanie’s in a quandary. She wonders whether to erase her
name from DECORATIONS or SNACKS. Always the problem-solver,
Stephanie tries to come up with an equitable solution:

STEPHANIE
What if I just erase myself from
decorations and leave it for Emily? Then
if she can’t make it, I’11l still bring my
balloons and helium tank.

STACY
Please tell me you don’t actually own a
helium tank.

It just slipped out of Stacy - and she regrets it. Stephanie
is a bit hurt by the comment but tries to hide it.

STEPHANIE
I think lots of people own helium tanks,
Stacy. If they don’t, they should. Kids
love balloons, especially floaty ones.

MRS. KERRY
(try. ying to save Stephanie)
It’ 3! a perfect plan, Stephanie. We’1l
leave decorations open for Emily.

Stephanie looks proud, then notices the other parents staring
er like she’s an Alien. She deflates a bit.

EXT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY - MOMENTS LATER 5
Under the awning outside the school, parents are claiming
their children and trying to get them to put on raincoats.
Umbrellas snap open as water cascades off the awning.

Stephanie returns from loading her car, greeting her son
Miles again as he emerges beside a jacketless Nicky.

STEPHANIE
Hey, Smooch. Great work today.
NICKY
(laughs )
Smooch?
MILES

(a withering look)
Thanks a lot, mom.

NICKY
Can me and Miles have a playdate today?

STEPHANIE
“Miles and I,” sweetie. And I’m not sure.
We'd have to’ ask your mommy - and she’s
probably still in city.

NICKY
She's right there.

Nicky points as Stephanie spins to see:
5.

Walking across the soaked playground in a perfect straight
line, a raised BLACK UMBRELLA over the sleek outline of a
BURBERRY TRENCHCOAT - comes EMILY NELSON. She walks as if on
a fashion runway, never veering in the downpour even as a
lost Hello Kitty umbrella blows like a tumbleweed across her
ath. She’s a Classic beauty. Lights a cigarette. Nicky high
ives her and then hugs her. She hugs him back tightly.

EMILY
(to Nicky)
Hello, little man.

__NICKY
Hello, big woman.

EMILY
Don’t tell me you lost another jacket?

MILES
Ask her!

EMILY
Ask me what?

NICKY
Can me and ... Can I and...
(correcting himself)
I just want a play date.

EMILY
Good for you. And I want an unlimited
expense account. Neither event is
happening. Let’s go.

MILES NICKY
Play-date! Play-date! Play-date! Play-date!

Emily gives a world-weary sigh.

EMILY
Nicky, stop. I’ve got a ton of work.

NICKY
Then keep your door closed and we won’t
even bother zou You don’t have to do
anything!

Emily glances at Stephanie, as if she might find solidarity
in this other mom. Stephanie gives her a bright smile.

EMILY
Please just get in the car, sweetie.

NICKY
You don’t let me do anything! You don’t
let me have any friends!

Emily feels the other parents watching. She flicks her
cigarette into a flower bed and turns to Stephanie.

EMILY
Do you drink? I need a martini.
STEPHANIE
A martini. Wow. I haven’t had a martini
in forever. Apple’s my favorite.

Emily stares a beat, then pivots back to Nicky.

. EMILY
Get in the car. No play date.

NICKY
Then I’m staying here.

STEPHANIE
Of course, it doesn’t need to be apple.

Emily turns back to Stephanie, who smiles at her again. Emily
just shakes her head and sighs, defeated. Gets a small smile.

EMILY
Christ, he’s as stubborn as I am. I’m
never gonna win this.
(to Stephanie)
Why don’t you come over for a non ple
drink and they can play? I need back-up

Miles and Nicky erupt into cheers, while Stephanie looks both
excited and nervous to be invited. She unconsciously fixes
her hair and straightens her blouse.
STEPHANIE
That would be lovely. No apples allowed.
Boo, apples. Ha ha.
Emily gives her a look of “What am I getting myself into?”

EXT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PARKING LOT/AWNING - DAY 6

 

DARREN, SONA, and STACY watch as STEPHANIE and EMILY run
under the same umbrella as the boys race ahead, stomping
puddles.

STEPHANIE
Don’t swamp your galoshes!
STACY
What on earth are those two going to talk

about?
SONA,
Maybe they won’t talk. Maybe Stephanie
ill color-code her Tupperware.

DARREN
You really think Emily has Tupperware?

STACY
Ha, she keeps her leftovers in Prada bags.

SONA
Emily's going to eat her alive.

DARREN
At least she'd be eating something.
EXT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAY 7

Stephanie’s VOLVO pulls in behind Emily’s vintage BMW.
Stephanie gets out into the lingering drizzle and marvels at
the house: a MODERN DREAM of glass, steel and poured concrete
plunked in the midst of suburban Connecticut.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAY 8

Miles and Nicky tear upstairs. Stephanie slips off her wet
moccasins, revealing KITTY-CAT SOCKS.

EMILY
Cute socks.

STEPHANIE
Oh, yeah. Target. A pack is only ten
dollars. They must lose money on them.
They have other animals, too. Chipmunks,
squirrels ...

Stephanie sees a PAINTING OF NUDE EMILY. Her eyes go wide.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
... beavers.

The painting hanging in the foyer depicts Emily at age 18,
with red hair, staring at her own reflection with a hard
expression. Stephanie tries to play it cool.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Wow, that is so ... lifelike.

EMILY
Used to dye my hair. I get bored easily.

STEPHANIE
It’s terrific. Who painted it?

EMILY

An_almost-famous painter from the East
Village. My life is littered with Almost-
Somebodies. I did some art modeling to
pay my way through school. But the weirdo
got obsessed with me. Like restraining
order obsessed. Anyway y I stole the
painting, hoping it'd be worth something
someday. No such luck.

Stephanie is still reeling from the story as Emily slips off
her heels and heads into a dream LIVING ROOM, decorated with
a bold, eclectic mix of modern and vintage. Emily switches on
Sonos, which plays the 1960s French pop song “COMMENT TE DIRE
ADIEU” by Francoise Hardy. Stephanie is in awe.

STEPHANIE
What an incredible house.

EMILY
It’s a fucking money pit.

STEPHANIE
Oopsy.
EMILY
The fuck?

STEPHANIE
Oh, I’m sorry. It’s what we say when
someone swears. Force of habit.
(off Emily’s look)
We have an “oopsy” jar in the pantry. A
quarter for every bad word.

EMILY
You should smash the oopsy jar. It might
change your whole life.

STEPHANIE
I’m sorry.

EMILY
And stop saying you're sorry. It's a
fucked“up female habit. Don’t be sorry
for anything. Ever.

STEPHANIE
You‘re right. Thank you. That’s great
advice. I love your music, by the way.

EMILY
It’s old French pop from the 60s. Makes
me forget I’m stuck in this shithole
town. I’1l make the drinks.

Emily heads toward the kitchen. Stephanie looks to make sure
Emily is out of sight, then starts doing a little dance
around the living room to the music as she looks at
everything. She’s never been anywhere so “classy.”

EMILY (CONT'D)
coming back in)
You like olives or -- what are you doing?

STEPHANIE
Oh! Um. Just got caught up in the moment.

EMILY
(shakes her head, amused)
Jesus Christ. Come with me, Audrey
Hepburn, before you hurt yourself.
An embarrassed Stephanie follows Emily into the kitchen.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 9

 

Sea green glass tiles, slate counter tops and_hand blown
glass fixtures. A kitchen out of Architect’s Digest.

STEPHANIE
Wow, you must really love to cook.

EMILY
No. Sometimes Sean does, but I think it’s
just an excuse to avoid writing.

STEPHANIE .
Your husband? He’s a writer?
10

11

Emily begins to mix a MARTINI at the built-in WET BAR.

EMILY

Was. Now he’s a bitter English professor
at Connecticut College. He wrote a book
ten years ago that made him the toast of
New York. I€ opened every door in the
city, It was non-stop, the dinners, the
parties. All of Manhattan was like one
ong line of cocaine.

Stephanie forces a demure smile.

EMILY (CONT’D
I had to stalk him and force him to fall
in love with me. Then ... nothing. One
big anti-climax. He never finished
another book. The old bait-and-switch.

STEPHANIE
But he loves you. What was the book?

EMILY
It was called Darkness at Dawn.

STEPHANIE
Oh my Gosh! I read that in my book club.
That’s when I first became a single mom,
I was so tired at the end of the day I
was just jopping onto Miles’s bean bag
chair _in front of the Kardashians. And
then I thought - this is ridiculous. So I
joined a book club and that was the first
one we read. So impressive.

EMILY
You're divorced then?

STEPHANIE
Widowed.

EMILY

You mind if I ask how he died?

EXT. CONNECTICUT HIGHWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK) 10
A classic Noir flashback: A CAR picks up speed down an empty
highway past changing foliage. It swerves across TWO LANES TO
THE LEFT, THEN VEERS HARD INTO A LAMP POST IN THE STEEL
MEDIAN with a violent SMASH. It’s a horrific wreck.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - BACK TO PRESENT 11
Stephanie tries to put on a cheerful face for Emily.

STEPHANIE
Car accident.

EMILY
How awful. I’m so sorry.

STEPHANIE
My brother Chris was in the passenger
seat.
10.

EMILY
You're kidding.

STEPHANIE
In one fell swoop, I lost the two most
important men in my life. Well, aside
from Miles, obviously. Two out "of three.

Emily studies Stephanie for a long time now. Slowly, her eyes
begin to well up. A single tear courses a line through her
make-up, until she wipes it away.

EMILY
I can usually. stomach sad stories. For
some reason that one got to me.

STEPHANIE
I don’t talk about it much. Especially
with people I just met. I’m sorry.

EMILY
Lady, I’m going to slap the “sorry” right
out of you if you apologize again.

STEPHANIE
I’m s---oopsy. Dang it. Hard habit to
break. I’m not sorry. Ha ha.

Emily generously pours the first martini and hands it to
Stephanie. Not a drinker, Stephanie sips it politely.

EMILY
So, are you dating anyone?

STEPHANIE
Me? No. It’s slim pickin’s in Warfield.

EMILY
You’re an hour and a half from the city.

STEPHANIE
Oh, I couldn’t date anyone from the cit
That’s a little too fast for me. I trie
eHarmony, but then that mother of three
wound up with her head in a trash can -
and I said, “No, thank you.”

EMILY
You're too young and cute to give up.

STEPHANIE

Really? Thank you. I never thought I’d
end up a single mom, trying to make ends
meet. My husband had life insurance,
thank goodness ; but not a lot. And I put
half of it away for Miles’ college. So,
even with a fixed income, that money will
run out in 2020. Tokyo Olympics. Go, USA.

EMILY
Sean barely makes a dime. I have to pay
for everything. And he spends like he’s
still the man of the hour. We’re upside
down on this house, too.

(MORE )
11.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Bought it during the bubble and we can’t
sel People hate modern around here.

STEPHANIE
Well, I love it. Don’t even think of
selling it. If I lived here, I’d just
bask in this kitchen all day.

EMILY
Well, cheers, then. Here’s to being
“House Poor.”

Clink! Stephanie eyes Emily’s BARBED WIRE TATTOO BRACELET.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Yeah, there’s another one of my bad
decisions. I got that when I was too
young and stupid to know better.

STEPHANIE
It’s a nice contrast with your ring.

Emily flashes her VINTAGE WEDDING RING. Platinum filigree
with sapphires and diamonds, c. 1920.

EMILY
This? It’s a family heirloom. Belonged to
Sean's “great_grandmum,” then his “mum.”
She insisted I have it.

In the next room, the front door is unlocked and opened.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Speak of the devil ...

A MALE VOICE with a British accent calls out:

SEAN (0.S.)
Whose Volvo is blocking the garage?

SEAN {30s) enters the kitchen, a handsome academic carrying a
bag of groceries. He acts light but has a burdened and uneasy
quality, an addict always in the early stages of withdrawal.
Emily 1s his heroin: both his greatest pleasure and curse.

STEPHANIE
Oh, that’s me. I’m sorry.
(winces at her “sorry”)
Your wife is trying to get me to stop
saying I’m sorry.

SEAN
(with a pointed laugh)
Maybe you can get her to start.
to Emily)
You left wo early, you couldn’t stop at
the grocer’s before martini time?

EMILY
I’m so sorry. Did I cut into your writing
time?

SEAN

(forcing a smile)
Going right for the sword today, are we?
12.

EMILY
(a playful smile back)
What’s the point? I’ve heard the pen is
mightier. Maybe try it some time.

Sean looks stung but covers with a laugh as Bmily moves in
and loops her arms around his neck, kissing him ceply-
Stephanie lingers watching them a moment too long, her lips
parted. Emily ends the kiss and gestures to Stephanie.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Babe, this is Stephanie. Her son goes to
Warfield with Nicky.

STEPHANIE
I'ma big. fan of your book. I thought it
was brilliant writing. It reminded me of
William Thackeray.

SEAN
Well, that’s certainly high praise. Not
Many people trot out Thackeray as a
reference these days --

STEPHANIE

I was an English major at Barnard. But
that was a lifetime ago, before
“Mommybrain” set in. I did my senior
thesis on Canterbury Tales.

(in olde English)
“And with that word Arcite gan espye,
Wher-as this lady romed to and fro --”

SEAN
(looking at Emily)
“And with that sighte hir beautee hurte
hym so ...” One of my favorite verses. So
much truth in so few words.

EMILY
(shakes head; laughs)
Jesus, you should have married Sean.
(to Sean)
Want me to mix you a drink?

SEAN
Not yet. I’m going to go upstairs and
take a shower. Nice to meet you, Sharon.

As he heads away across the living room ...

EMILY
He’s terrible with names.

STEPHANIE
Well, Stephanie’s a hard one. Boy, you
two are ... what a cute couple.

EMILY

Lotta good that does us. I never thought
anything would go this way. The job in
the city, the house in the suburbs -
13.

STEPHANIE
You‘ve figured out how to “have it all.”
How do you juggle it?

EMILY
This isn’t juggling. This is a nightmare.
We're on the verge of bankruptcy. I never
sleep, I eat seven-hundred calories a day
- and I can’t find a decent nanny in all
of Connecticut.

STEPHANIE
If you ever need me to pick up Nicky
after school, I'd be happy to bring him
to my house.

EMILY
You'd do that for me? I’m practically a
stranger. I’m never at the school.

STEPHANIE
Well, you will be. I just signed you up
for the Easter decoration crew.

Emily gapes . back. Suddenly, Miles races into the kitchen on
socks, iding like a speed skater on the slick floor.

; MILES .
Nicky wants me to stay for dinner!

STEPHANIE
Oh, not tonight, Smooch. I have to do my
vlog before dinner.
(to Emily)
I have a Mommy Vlog. For fun and a little
extra income.

EMILY
That’s very resourceful.

STEPHANIE
Six hundred and ten page views a day. I
really need a hundred thousand to start
monetizing the site with ad revenue. So,
it’s more a way to connect with other
moms. It’s a community.

MILES
Mom! Can I stay for dinner or not?

_ STEPHANIE ;
I don’t like this new tone, Mister.

EMILY
Let him stay. I’1l have Sean drive him
home later. That way you can go do your
t

vlog in a nice quie ouse.
MILES
(running out)
Yeeees!!! Nicky!! I can stay!
STEPHANIE

Thank you. I know how busy you are.
12

13

14.

EMILY
No sweat. I’m sure I'll be calling you
for a favor any day. You owe me now.

Emily flashes her megawatt smile and pours another drink.
Stephanie beams, dazzled by her.

A_ COMPUTER WINDOW POPS UP (STEPHANIE’S VLOG) - KITCHEN 12

 

In her lit set of a kitchen, Stephanie now has full makeup,
hair flat-ironed. She’s warm and chipper.

STEPHANIE
Hi, Moms. Stephanie here. If this is your
first visit to my vlog - a hearty
welcome. And ity out Sehe survey at the

bottom so I can thank whoever referred
you with this lovely lavender sachet.
(holds up sachet, then)
Today’ s theme is friendshi iD. You know, I
don‘t understand these silly, hurtful
divisions between working moms and stay-
at-home moms. The truth is, I’ve found it
hard to make friends with either.
Parenthood can be isolating. Honestly,
you moms have been better friends to me
even though we’ve never met in person. I
treasure each and every one of you.
Truly. And so I thought today ...

She clicks the ZOOM OUT button on her remote to reveal the
island is covered with packets of colored string.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
... was a perfect day for FRIENDSHIP
BRACELETS! To celebrate the most
important bonds of our lives. Other than
family, of course.

EXT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 13

 

There's a new spring in Stephanie’s step as she gets out of
her VOLVO with a box of CANNED GOODS marked MATH: Mothers
Assisting The Homeless. As she trundles the heavy load, her
CELL PHONE rings. She gtimpses the call screen - EMILY - and
she drops the box, sending cans rolling around the lot.

STEPHANIE (ON THE PHONE)
Hello? Emily? Hi there! What’s up, lady?

EMILY (0.8.
I was wondering if I could take you up on
your offer to pick up Nicky - I'm ina
meeting with no end in sight.

STEPHANIE EMILY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Of course! I’m happy to hel You're the best, Stephanie.
I just bought aj io set o

Perler beads --

STEPHANIE
And I have extra snacks. I just need to
know if he has any dietary restrictions.
14

15.

EMILY
I have no idea. Thanks!

EXT. WARFIELD LOCAL PARK - DAY 14

In her “Yearbook Mom” photo vest and camera, Stephanie chases
Miles and Nicky around the jungle gym with a_roar and finger
claws -- a game of “Darth Mommy” that Miles loves. She’s good
with them, making them squeal and dart away from her.

Emily pulls up in her car and walks toward the park, still on
a work call and exuding irritation.

STEPHANIE (ON THE PHONE)
Calm down, Dennis. Alexi is all talk. No
one is “coming after you.” Take a fucking
Xanax and let me do my job. Jesus.

Emily ends the call and watches Stephanie chase the boys, a
natural mother in her element. Emily feels a pinch of guilt,
even jealousy. Stephanie sees Emily and jogs over, winded.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
“Darth Mommy,” we call it. It’s silly.
But it’s one of Miles’ favorite games.
One of the things he remembers from his
Dad. He was much better at roughhousing.

After flashing side eye, Emily pulls out a compact mirror and
begins tracing around her mouth with a pencil.

EMILY
Don’t do that.

STEPHANIE
Do what?

EMILY

Don’t denigrate your good parenting to
comfort me for my shitty parenting.

STEPHANIE
Oh, gosh, Emily. That’s not what I was
doing at all. I think you're a super mom--

EMILY
No, you don’t. You pack nori rolls for
lune If I even remember the lunch box,
it’s a miracle. The nicest thing I could
do for Nicky is blow my brains out.
(off Stephanie’s horror)
I have a dark sense of humor.

STEPHANIE
Yeah, yikes. You do work in the city.

Emily stares emotionally at Nicky, who’s playing happily. and
unaware of her. We see how much she loves him. Then -
Emily spins to see that Stephanie has snapped a pictures

EMILY
(sharply)
What did you just do?
15

16.

STEPHANIE
I’m... the yearbook mom.
EMILY
Erase it.
STEPHANIE
But you look so ... chic.
EMILY

If that shows up on your vlog --

STEPHANIE
No, gosh, no. It’s just for the “Faces
and Placés” section. Only other parents
would see it -

EMILY
Erase it now or I'll slap an injunction
on the whole fucking yearbook.

Shaking, Stephanie erases the photo from her digital display,
showing Emily the last pictures of a cooking project.

STEPHANIE
Gone. See. Just homemade granola.

EMILY
Good. Don’t do that shit again.

STEPHANIE
Gosh, I’m sor-- I mean, I didn’t mean to
offend you. I can understand in your line
of work how sensitive this is.
(struggling)
I guess I’m not someone you'd normally be
friends with.

EMILY
You don’t want to be friends with me.
Trust me. You’re a real human being.

Stephanie can’t tell if Emily means to forgive her with that
comment - but she takes it with a bashful smile.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Let’s grab the kids and get the hell out
of here. I need a drink.
INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 15

STEPHANIE (0.S.)
I made it especially for you.

CLOSE SHOT - Stephanie ties a new FRIENDSHIP BRACELET over
Emily's wrist, right onto the barbed wire tattoo.

EMILY
It’s very sweet.

Emily regards the CHEVRON PATTERN. Then she pours gin into a
shaker to finish the martinis. Stephanie watches in awe.

STEPHANIE
I used to watch old Bewitched episodes on
TV Land and always thought it was so
classy when Darren would come home and
Samantha would mix him a martini. And now
here I am. Again. It’s so high tone.

Emily chuckles as she shakes the ice-filled martini shaker.

EMILY
God, you're such a nerd, I hope it’s not
contagious. They'd make me quit my job.

Stephanie daughs . but we see she wishes she was cooler. Emily
pours . one martini from the shaker. It’s cloudy with ice chips
loating in it. Emily stares at it a beat, then:

EMILY (CONT'D
Fuck this. I need a real martini.

STEPHANIE
This one’s not real?

Emily goes to the fridge, opens the freezer and pulls out a
frozen bottle of gin and one frozen martini glass. She brings
it back over to the island.

EMILY

Too watered-down. When Sean and I were in
London, we had the real thing at Dukes
Hotel. Sometimes you just need something
with a kick to reset your brain.

(making the martini)
Frozen gin, frozen glass. Pour in a small
bit of vermouth, swirl it and dump it.
Then add the gin and squeeze a twist over
the top. Pure booze, no ice, strong as
hell. Gotta work your way up to it,
though. No amateurs allowed.

Emily hands Stephanie the watered-down martini, then picks up
her strong martini and clinks with Stephanie.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Alessandro the bartender has a saying at
Dukes. “One’s not enough, three’s too
many, two’s just right. Just like tits.”
STEPHANIE _. EMILY (CONT'D)
Oopsy. L’chaim.
Emily takes a sip and visibly relaxes. Stephanie studies her.
STEPHANIE

Can you make me one of those? I think I
need to reset my brain too.

Off Emily’s impressed smile ...

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 16

 

Stephanie and Emily sit on the couch as a fire blazes in the
fireplace. A FRENCH 60'S POP SONG PLAYS. Stephanie is clearly
wasted. She takes another drink, smacking her lips.
18.

STEPHANIE
I really am not happy with myself about
the picture I took . of you. That was
so rude ... like a paparazzo eee

EMILY.

Oh, please - will you get over it
already: Stephanie? You're so nice, I
don’t know how you" ve managed to survive
on this planet for so long.

STEPHANIE
(stares for a long beat
I’m not as nice as you thin

EMILY
Oh, really ...? Are you baiting me?
STEPHANIE
I‘m juss’ Saying - we all have a dark
side. Even “nerds.” It’s juss’ -- some of

us are better at hiding it. My mother
once said, “Secrets are like margarine--”

Stephanie stops as_ her drink goes down the wrong pipe and she
chokes, coughing. Emily laughs.

EMILY
She had a way with words. Okay, Dark
Side. Let’s trade confessions. Tell me
the wildest thing you’ve ever done.

STEPHANIE
What? No. I mean ... well ... okay.
Maybe. But you go first.

EMILY
(thinks a moment)
Well, I can think of a pretty recent one.
Sean and I had his TA over about six
months ago. We drank too much and had a
threesome.

Stephanie’s jaw slackens. She covers her open mouth.

STEPHANIE
(whispering)
Wasn’t Sean jealous of him?

EMILY
Who says it was a him?

Stephanie digests this info. Nods, trying to stay cool. She
does a bad job. Emily grins, amused by the effort.

EMILY (CONT'D)
I didn’t mean to freak you out.

STEPHANIE
(freaked out, hiding it)
I am - what do you mean? I’m not freaked
out. I’m completely ... laissez faire.

EMILY
I just know you’re not exactly a sexual
maverick. Nothing wrong with that. Prudes
are people, too.

Emily winks. Stephanie absorbs the insult, smarting.
EMILY (CONT'D)
But now I really want to hear your dirty
little secret. Spill it.

Stephanie downs the rest of her drink, nearly swallowing the
lemon twist. She takes a breath, then ...

STEPHANIE oo,
My father died when I was a senior in
High School ...

INT. PITTSBURGH ROW HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK) 17

 

Pouring rain outside. A funeral reception. PEOPLE are dressed
in black, crowded into a modest house, having sandwiches.
STEPHANIE (here 18) moves through the house cleaning up. No
make-up, hair in a ponytail, simple black dress. She heads...

INTO THE KITCHEN (FLASHBACK 18
She looks out the window and sees CHRIS (20). He wears an ill-

fitting suit, dark hair in his eyes, skinny like a rock star.
He approaches the door. Stephanie freezes, unable to breathe.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
... A boy showed up at the funeral.

IN THE LIVING ROOM (FLASHBACK 19
Her mother GRACE (50) opens the front door and nearly faints.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
His name was Chris.

It’s like seeing the young, handsome ghost of her dead
husband. The crowd haS now gathered to watch this unfold.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
He was the spitting image of my father -
only thirty years younger.

Grace starts to cry and throws her arms around Chris’ neck,
holding him as if he’s her dead husband. Chris hugs her back,
lifts his eyes and looks RIGHT AT Stephanie.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)

 

Turns out ... he was my half-brother.
INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - BACK TO PRESENT 20
EMILY

Hold on. This is your deep dark secret?
That your dad had an affair?

STEPHANIE
(drunk, steadying herself)
No, this is necess’ssary prologue.

EMILY
Necessary prologue. Got it. Keep going,
Dark Side.

INT. PITTSBURGH ROW HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 21

Now in jeans and a tank top Stephanie unfolds the rusty y
stained pullout couch for hris. A bare bulb hangs overhead
illuminating the moldy basement.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
We talked for a long time, looking at old
photos of my dad. It was too late for
Chris to drive home. So he stayed over.

Chris watches Stephanie make the bed. She can feel his eyes
on her ass as she crawls across to stretch the fitted sheet.
They lock eyes. Their chests rising with desire.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
Maybe it was the loss of my dad, who was
the only person who ever truly understood
me, maybe it was the way Chris looked and
acted like him, or the fact I suddenly
wasn’t an only child, which I never
wanted to be. I don’t know, we just stood
there for the longest time.

She moves_in and loops her arms around his neck to say good
night, pulling him close. She tips her chin, looks up at him.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
We didn’t know how to say goodbye.

Lips so close. They start to kiss. Tug at each other’s
clothes, desperate to merge as quickly as possible.

Chris throws her on the bed and fumbles with his fly. She
yanks off her jeans. Chris climbs on top of her and thrusts
into her, eyes wide in amazement. She gasps: She’s never had
sex like this, great sex. She presses her lips together and
shakes with an orgasm building. She buries her face in his
shoulder and groans_as it swallows her up. He comes at the
same moment and collapses. They lie together stunned, sweaty.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - BACK TO SCENE 22

 

Stephanie stares into space. Emily snaps her fingers in front
of Stephanie’s eyes.

EMILY
Hello? Keep going! You’re not allowed to
be too drunk in my house not to finish a
juicy story.

STEPHANIE
Me? No, I’m fine. What was I saying?

EMILY
You stood there for the longest time, you
didn’t know how to say goodbye. I’m
waiting for the big ending here.

Stephanie can’t tell the truth. But she’s cornered. Then ...
21.

STEPHANIE
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s not so racy
where you're from. I went in to hug him
and then we ... kissed.
(buries face in hands)
It’s so gross.

EMILY
So that’s your whole story? You kissed
your brother? Once?

STEPHANIE
It's like Chinatown! We immediately said
this will never happen again, and we'd
never breathe a word. And no, he wasn’t
my brother, he was my half-brother.

Emily sizes Stephanie up. She sips her drink, then leans in.

Swear.

EMILY
There’s more.

STEPHANIE
No, there’s no more.

EMILY
You started that story, then hit the
eject button. I saw it happen.

STEPHANIE

I did not eject -
EMILY

You fucked him.
STEPHANIE

What!? No! I didn’t say that.

EMILY STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
I swear.

EMILY

Swear on your father’s grave.

STEPHANIE
Really? That would be lovely.

Great. You're cooking, Dark Side.

Stephanie gives her a look, then they share a genuine laugh.
Stephanie absorbs it: they really are becoming friends.

CLOSE UP of Alka Seltzer being dropped into a glass. REVEAL a

She opens up her FIRST AID kit and lays out the items.

Hi Moms, Stephanie here. Today we’ll be
talking about the perfect First Aid Kit,
so that you’re never left in need during
a crisis --

She doesn’t like how that sounds, and starts to revise her
SCRIPT. Just then, her CELLPHONE rings. As she answers:

I'm fine, but I need a simple favor, Can

London, his mother broke her fucking hip,
and I got a big fire to put out at work.

STEPHANIE
Oh, Gosh, poor Sean. Poor you. Of course,
I’m always happy to help.

EMILY
You're the best. I gotta run but I’1l get
you back for this.

STEPHANIE
Of course! Nicky’s in good hands.

EMILY
You're a great friend, Stephanie. A true
friend. I really mean that.
OFF STEPHANIE, beaming --

The boys both cheer as Darren approaches, Lulu in his arms.

DARREN
Stephanie, that’s so great you took the
nanny job.

|. _ STEPHANIE
Nanny job?

DARREN
For Emily. I know she was looking.

STEPHANIE
(mortified)
I am -- No. I am not - this is not a job.
I'm helping her out. As a friend.

DARREN
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you guys
were so close.

STEPHANIE
Well, we are. We drink martinis together.
strong martinis. From London.
(to the boys, the 7fFun

All right, fellas - if you don’t wrestle

They cheer again, running . across the yard - as Stephanie
storms away, throwing a dirty look back at Darren.

INT. STEPHANIE’S VOLVO - DAY 25

Stephanie, Miles and Nicky drive along, SINGING ALONG TO A
FUN SONG ON THE RADIO. Everyone’s really happy.

INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 26

The revelry seems to come to a sudden halt. Miles and Nicky
sulk at the kitchen table. Tempeh burger, carrots and steamed
spinach on their plates. Used to it, Miles eats; but Nick
pushes the food around with his fork as Miles sets down his
glass of milk on the wood table next to its coaster.

STEPHANIE
Miles, sweetie, you know the rule. Mr.
Glass always stands on Mr. Coaster.

MILES
(putting | glass on coaster)
Because of his wet feet. Sorry, mom.

STEPHANIE
Nicky, you can’t just live on starch.
People need 11 different amino acids.

NICKY
Do amino acids come from horse shit?

Miles gasps in horror. Stephanie smiles, beatific.

Slack this time because you’re a guest.

NICKY
Well, that’s what it tastes like. Are you
telling me to lie?

STEPHANIE
No, lying is wrong, too. But there’s a
difference between lying and being
polite. So we can at least take a “no
thank you” bite and see if we like it.

He takes a bite of Tempeh burger, horrified, making a face
like it’s torture. Then he pushes his plate away.

NICKY
No thank you.

INT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 27
The two boys watch SpongeBob Squarepants on TV, eating
popcorn. Stephanie texts Emily: “Should i give nicky a bath?”
She hits SEND. Waits. She fixates on her phone. No response.

INT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 28

 

Stephanie gives the two boys a bubble bath. They splash

around, hurling rubber sea creatures at each other.

STEPHANIE
Don’t splash. This isn’t Sea World.

They ignore her and splash harder.

“Hi, this is Emily Nelson, Director of
Public Relations Yor Dennis Nylon
Holdings. Leave a message here or at the
New York office at 212-555-6361.”

BEEP. Stephanie opens her mouth to speak, but hesitates. As
she dives in, she’s now even more sugar-coated than before.

STEPHANIE
Hi, Em, Stephanie. Hey. I know you're
probably knee-deep in that crisis. But,
um, Nicky asked when you were coming and
I didn’t know what to tell him. They’re
having a hoot here, don’t worry. And I’m
happy to watch him as long as you need,

anging in there.

She hangs up, her smile dropping.

INT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT 30

 

As Stephanie climbs up to say good night to Miles on the TOP
BUNK, her head gets trapped in a HANGING SOLAR SYSTEM MOBILE
affixed to the ceiling. She tries to blow away a Styrofoam
Saturn, finally clearing planets like a cloud of gnats.

STEPHANIE
G’night, Smooch.
MILES
Good night, Mama.
(looking up)
And good night, Daddy. Good night, Uncle
Chris.
NICKY
Who's Uncle Chris?
STEPHANIE
Chris was my brother. He’s in heaven now.
NICKY
There’s no such thing as heaven.
STEPHANIE
Is that what your mommy and daddy tell
you?
NICKY

My Dad says life’s just a brief moment of
pain before an eternity of darkness.

STEPHANIE
Well, he’s an English professor.

NICKY
And he says when we die we turn into a
feast for bacteria.

STEPHANIE
Well, at least someone is eating dinner
then.

She checks Miles, hoping this didn’t sink in.

STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
Do you want a kiss good night, Nicky?

NICKY
I want to go home. My Mom didn’t say I
was sleeping over.

STEPHANIE
She should be here any minute and then
she’1ll come wake you up.

Stephanie pecks Nicky on the cheek anyway. He rubs his face
with disgust as she walks out and closes the door.

Stephanie makes two kids’ lunches for the next day in
silence.

She mashes avocados and nori on whole grain bread, then cuts
the sandwiches in half. She texts Emily: “Made lunch for
Nicky. Text me to say you’re ok. Worried about u.”

She hits SEND. Waits a beat. No response. She finds a bottle
of WHITE ZINFANDEL in the back of the fridge, half empty. She
unscrews the screw cap and sniffs it. Still good? Maybe. She
pours herself a glass.

She steals a cookie from under Saran Wrap. She nibbles a tiny
bit of it, washing it down with wine. She slips the cookie
back, looking guilty. Looks at her phone. Nothing from Emily.

CUT TO:
3 a.m. Stephanie dumps the empty wine bottle into the
necycling in. The cookies have been devoured. She washes the
dish in the sink, disgusted with herself.
EXT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 32

 

PUSH IN ON the PARKED VOLVO as Stephanie tries to get a hold
of Emily at work. She speaks slowly and with a forced calm.

A TAXI pulls up in front of the house. The first time we've

opposite of Emily and Sean’s house.

Sean gets out of the cab and pays the driver, dragging his
bag toward the front door. He knocks and Stephanie opens.

SEAN

Oh, you. You’re Miss Canterbury Tales. So

Stephanie and Sean speak in low voices in the kitchen.

SEAN
So nothing? Still no word?

STEPHANIE
Nothing. Not to you either?

SEAN
No, but that’s not unusual. We had a bit
of a row the other day.

STEPHANIE
I’m sorry.

SEAN
Don‘t be. It’s our pattern. All dramatic
breakups and reunions, with almost

Yes, but ... it keeps life interesting.

Her assistant Valerie hasn’t been able to

go to the police.

SEAN
The moms?

STEPHANIE
I posted something about Emily on my

tips, odds-and-ends. It’s mostly How-To.

He looks at her with jet-lagged eyes. It’s all sinking in.

Sean? The police are here.

INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 40

Stephanie sits at_the dining room table while TWO POLICE
question Sean: SERGEANT MOLLOY and OFFICER BLANCO.

OFFICER BLANCO
And when was the last time either of you
heard from her?

Sean swims, shaking his head. He looks over at Stephanie.

STEPHANIE
Four days ago.
SEAN
I’m sorry. I was in London. My mum broke

her hip.

SERGEANT MOLLOY
Sorry to hear that.

OFFICER BLANCO
And she said it was a work crisis?

SEAN
She has a very high profile job - with a
full staff she oversees.
31.

OFFICER BLANCO
And what do you do, sir?

SEAN
I’m an Associate Professor.

OFFICER BLANCO
And what do you teach?

SEAN
English.

SERGEANT MOLLOY
Sounds like you're pretty good at it.

SEAN
That’s wonderful. Well-played.

SEARGEANT MOLLOY
Ever slept with a student?

Stephanie is shocked.

SEAN
Excuse me? Do you think I had something
to do with my wife’s disappearance?

OFFICER BLANCO
No need to get defensive, Mr. Townsend.
We're just exploring all avenues.

SEAN
Well, that’s a dead end. No. Christ.

SERGEANT MOLLOY
Most times when a woman vanishes, she has
a reason. A really good reason.

SEAN
That’s an astute piece of detective work.
What are you implying?

OFFICER BLANCO
You two didn’t have a fight? Something to
make you run off to London?

SEAN
Are you implying I broke my mother’s hip?

OFFICER BLANCO
We're just looking at this objectively.
You leave town, your wife takes off.
Perhaps there was some abuse--

STEPHANIE

(can’t take any an ed
How dare you. This man flew back from his
mother’s bedside. This is a dedicated
father and husband. I’ve seen him with
his wife, and let me tell you something:
they are in love. They have more
chemistry than the Science Fair.

OFFICER BLANCO
Just exploring all avenues, Ma’am.
32.

STEPHANIE
Like Sean said, that avenue’s a dead end.
Or at least a cul-de-sac. So, drop it.

Sean is astonished. No one has ever defended him with such
veracity - and he now can’t take his eyes off Stephanie, who
even surprised herself. The officers are unfazed, however.

OFFICER BLANCO
And where’s Emily’s family?

SEAN
She doesn’t have any. She was an only
child. Her parents died when she was a
teenager.

STEPHANIE
She never told me that.

SERGEANT MOLLOY
We'll file a Missing Person report and
contact you ina day or two. If she
doesn’t turn up we’ll contact local
authorities in Miami. You’re not planning
any more trips, Mr. Townsend?

SEAN
No. I‘’ll be right here. I mean, at_m
house. Taking care of my son. Until this
matter is resolved.

OFFICER BLANCO
We can show ourselves out.

As Blanco and Molloy leave, Sean and Stephanie stare at each
other a moment in silence across the room.

STEPHANIE
Well, they were extremely rude.
SEAN
I need a serious drink.
STEPHANIE
I have some white zinfandel in the
fridge.

Oh god no. I’m sorry. I’m sure it’s

uncomfortable. I know you don’t believe
in heaven, so it’s not like he’1ll mind.

SEAN ;
How would you know what I believe?

STEPHANIE
Oh. Gosh. Nicky - He doesn’t like our
prayers at night.

SEAN
(with a chuckle)
Well, we're not sacrificing goats or
anything at our house.

STEPHANIE
I welcome all denominations.

SEAN
As do I. Let’s drink your husband's
scotch.

INT. STEPHANIE’S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT 41

Stephanie and Sean sit at the kitchen table with two whiskey
glasses and a bottle of single malt between them. Stephanie
refills their glasses. Sean sips his.

SEAN
God knows, we've had our troubles - but
+. I don’t think she would just up and
leave her child. Do you?

STEPHANIE
She adores Nicky. She could never do that.

SEAN
She’s an enigma, my wife. It drew me to
her. But it can also make her impossible.
She can be so fiercely private.

STEPHANIE
She sure doesn’t like having her picture
taken, I’1l tell ya that.

Sean sparks at this, studying her more closely.

SEAN
That’s right. She works in the fashion
industry, but you’d think you were
stealing her soul. I remember once she
made me shut down my Facebook account
after I posted a family picture.

; STEPHANIE ;
Social media can be pretty tricky.

SEAN
You can get close to her, but you can
never really reach her. That's the truly
hypnotic thing about Emily. She’s like a
beautiful ghost. She’s never entirely
ere.

STEPHANIE
That's really poetic. I can see why
you’re such a good writer.
He looks up at her with inconsolable pain in his eyes.
SEAN
I’m not a writer, Stephanie. T gave it up to
chase this woman for the rest of my life.

She puts her hand onto his, comforting him.
42

34.

SEAN (CONT'D)
I got addicted to her. God, and she
devours me. The things she does, you
wouldn’t believe it. She’s like a
succubus. So_ beautiful, so primal. Her
orgasms are like seismic events.

He looks down at her hand, on his. She withdraws hers.

STEPHANIE
Well, I’m a good Judge of character, Mr.
Sean T. Townsend. And I know Emily loves
you. One thousand percent.

SEAN
I should call a taxi home.

STEPHANIE
(glancing at the clock)
Oh my Gosh, it’s 1:25. They stop driving
at 1 a.m. here.

SEAN
What about an Uber?

STEPHANIE

Well, there’s only two Uber drivers in
Warfield, and I know Davit has his son’s
recital in the morning.

(a beat)
I have a guest room. Why don’t you stay
over? Nicky will want to see you when he
wakes up.

OFF SEAN, contemplating it --

INT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT 42

 

Stephanie pulls open the HIDE-A-BED onto a few DINOSAURS
stranded on their sides and starts to prepare the bed.

SEAN
I can do that. Really. You’ve already
done so much.
Stephanie stops and heads for the hallway.

SEAN (CONT'D)
And Stephanie? Thank you. For everything.

Sean sits down on the creaking swayback bed, setting off a
RECORDED SONG: “Me mind of fire... me soul on fire... feeling
hot hot hot.” He reaches under his butt ...

STEPHANIE .
Oh, that’s where Dr. Crackers is.

Sean pulls out a SINGING PARROT, activated by a button,
singing: “Party people, all around me feeling hot hot hot.”

INT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 43

 

Sunlight pours in the window. The sound of CHILDREN’S VOICES
rouses Stephanie out of an intoxicated gieep. She shakes
cobwebs from her head. She hears the GRINDING of a BLENDER.

table drinking GREEN SMOOTHIES, Sean helming the blender with
a mix of CHIA SEEDS, YOGURT, KALE, SPINACH, BANANAS, HONEY.
SEAN
Who wants more B vitamins?
MILES
I do!
SEAN

And I’m sure mum does.

STEPHANIE ;
What on earth are you making?

SEAN
A hangover smoothie. It’ll knock it right
out of you. The kids love it.

Stephanie turns to the kids, amazed they’re drinking it.

SEAN (CONT'D)
(whispering; with a wink)
It’s a full serving of vegetables and
they don’t even know it.

She's shocked to hear him say something she always does.

SEAN (CONT’D
Hope this is okay. Don’t mean to mess up
your routine.

Her eyes are fixed on him now - with real desire.

SEAN (CONT'D)
Do you want some?

STEPHANIE
Yes, please.

Stephanie takes the smoothie from his hand, slowly. She
drinks it with her eyes locked on Sean. They have a long
moment in the kitchen. The toaster dings, breaking the spell.
Then they remember why they’re here.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
All right, kids. Party’s over. Let’s get
ready for school.

ON VIDEO VLOG - STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - DAY 45

Stephanie addresses the camera, looking a little worse for
wear. She looks at the PAGE STATISTICS and sees HER LIVE
TRAFFIC STATS. A graph shows viewership rising ...

Stephanie is on her hands and knees digging in her closet.
STEPHANIE (V.O.)

Well, as every mom knows, if you want

something done right, you better do it

yourself.
She finally finds a VINTAGE CHANEL SCARF in a gift box.
INT. STEPHANIE’S VOLVO (MOVING) - DAY 47
Stephanie wears the Chanel scarf, nattily knotted on the
side. Trying to look chic, in dark li stick, eyeliner and her
hair pulled back in a low ponytail. She drives.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
I will leave no stone unturned.

I/E. STEPHANIE’S VOLVO (MOVING) - G.W. BRIDGE - DAY 48
Stephanie drives into Manhattan playing Adele’s “HELLO.”

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
I think that’s what Emily would want.

She joins in singing the chorus of “HELLO” at top volume.

STEPHANIE
“Hello from the outside / I must_have
called a thousand times / To tell you I'm
sorry for breaking your heart ...

INT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN OFFICE BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY 49

It’s that awkward Be aye silence in a crowded elevator. As
Stephanie rides, she eyes the faces around her. Skinny
PROFESSIONAL WOMEN in sleek suits and stiletto heels.
PROFESSIONAL MEN in suits with slick-backed hair.
50

37.

Stephanie adjusts the knot on her scarf, pulling it tighter.
She accidentally pulls it too tight, choking herself. She
GASPS OUT A SMALL CHOKE SOUND, then plays it off as if it’s a
COUGH and THROAT CLEAR. Everyone stares at her.

|. STEPHANIE .
Allergies. It’s that wet spring we had.

Nobody buys it. Dying of embarrassment, she pulls the knot
looser as the doors open and Stephanie exits.

INT. DENNIS NYLON HQ - RECEPTION - DAY 50

 

White marble and chromium steel. White leather banquettes and
black lacquer side tables. The name DENNIS NYLON in giant
silver letters. Stephanie works up her nerve as she
approaches the chic RECEPTIONIST answering phones on headset.

RECEPTIONIST
Dennis Nylon, please hold. Thanks for
holding, how may I direct your call?

STEPHANIE RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
Hi. My name is -- (holding up a finger)

Her name is Emily Nelson. She’s the head
of public relations.

EMILY
Emily’s not in today.
STEPHANIE RECEPTIONIST
I know she’s not in. That’s Dennis Nylon, please hold.

why I’m --

Stephanie lurches across the counter and presses the hang up
button, hissing at the young woman:

STEPHANIE
I’m sorry, but - no, you know what? I’m
not sorry. This is an emergenc A woman
is missing. I need to talk wit “Mr.
Nylon. Now.

RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Nylon’s not here right now.

STEPHANIE
Then I’1l wait.

RECEPTIONIST
Knock yourself out.

STEPHANIE
I will. Thank you very much.
38.

The receptionist gestures to the lobby seating area.
Stephanie gives her a defiant look and takes a seat. She
tries to lean back, but the back of the fashionable chair is
too far. She sits up straight, avoiding eye contact with the
receptionist, who just stares at her.

The elevator doors open and DENNIS NYLON (40s, Tom Ford type)
walks out with his assistants, KIKO and DIEGO. Diego is very
intense looking and a bit scary. As Dennis breezes past -

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Mr. Nylon!?

He turns as Diego steps forward and puts himself between |
Dennis and Stephanie. Dennis looks at Stephanie with disdain.

DENNIS NYLON
We don’t accept unsolicited resumes.

STEPHANIE
That's not -- We have a problem, sir.

, DENNIS NYLON
(looking her over)
We most certainly do.

STEPHANIE
A friend of mine works in your publicity
department--

DENNIS NYLON
Is that a vintage Chanel scarf?

STEPHANIE
My Aunt Frieda gave it to me.

DENNIS NYLON
Were you trying to hang yourself with it?
Look at this knot. Jesus.

He comes forward to loosen the knot around her neck.

STEPHANIE
I’m here because of Emily Nelson.

Dennis pauses, staring at Stephanie with concern now.

DENNIS NYLON
What about Emily? What happened?

STEPHANIE
She's missing. She asked me to pick up
her son nine days ago because apparently
she was going to Miami and she never came
back. Not a.call, not a text - and no one
in your office seems to give a crap.
Excuse my language.

DENNIS NYLON
(to Kiko)
Why did Emily go to Miami?

KIKO
I didn’t know she did.
51

39.

Dennis looks quite thrown, then recovers and returns his gaze
to Stephanie, regaining his power.

DENNIS NYLON
I’m sorry but if Emily hasn’t told us
about something then we know not to ask.

STEPHANIE
She works for you, right?

DENNIS NYLON
Yes, but do you see this skin? I’m 48
years— -old an that / s not botox, sweetie.
That's sleep. T get plenty of it, thanks
to Emil: Now, there’s something she’s
not tel ing me, it could be Chernobyl for
all I know, and bless her, she’ll put on
her radiation suit and deal with it.

KIKO
And find a way to look fabulous doing it.

STEPHANIE
Then what do you suggest I do?

DENNIS NYLON
You want advice? Never wear a Chanel
scarf with a Gap T-shirt. If you were
truly Emily’s friend, you’d know that.
Have a nice day.

STEPHANIE
(as they walk away)
It's Target, thank you very much. And we
are friends. Best friends.

Diego throws a scary look back at her as the receptionist
tries to escort her out. Stephanie starts to stride off.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
I’1ll show myself out.

She walks toward the elevators as the receptionist goes back
to her desk. Stephanie looks over at the doorway to the
cubicles area. Her eyes follow Dennis. He now looks upset.
She then sees an office door that reads: EMILY NELSON.

DENNIS NYLON (0.S.)
Valerie, my office. Now.

Dennis grabs Emily’s assistant VALERIE and pulls her urgently
toward his office, Diego in tow. Stephanie sees a sign over
the doorway to the cubicles area that reads “EMPLOYEES ONLY.”

Stephanie looks torn. She’s never disobeyed a rule before.
She glances around nervously, considers, then takes a deep
breath and darts secretly into the cubicles area.

INT. DENNIS NYLON HQ - CUBICLES AREA - CONTINUOUS 51
Stephanie pauses in the doorway. She sees an INTERN pulling a

RACK OF GARMENT BAGS along the aisle that leads to Emily’s
office. She darts behind the rack, moving stealthily.
52

She nods hello to the intern, trying to fit _in while watching
through the tops of the hangers as Dennis, Diego and Valerie
enter Dennis’ glass walled office and close the door.

Stephanie sees them talking intensely through the glass but
can’t hear what they’ re saying as she approaches Emily’s
office. But Dennis looks quite agitated. Diego listens, cold.

Suddenly, THE RACK TAKES A SHARP TURN, EXPOSING STEPHANIE
just as Diego turns and is about to see her. She quickly
darts through a door next to her, closing it behind her.

INT. DENNIS NYLON HQ - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 52
Stephanie leans against the door, nervous. To herself ...

STEPHANIE
Deep breaths, deep breaths ...

VOICE (0.S.)
Finally!

midgic of turns to see the room is filled with people in the
middle of a design review. They all stare at her. A DESIGNER
is leading the review. He looks at her impatiently.

DESIGNER
We’re dying in here. I need a skinny
latte with a double shot of vanill-- What
are you wearing?

STEPHANIE
Oh, um, it’s Chanel.

DESIGNER
(stares a beat, then)
It’s fab. Dennis would love that. All
right, what’s everyone else want?
Looking at her again)
Don’t tell me you didn’t bring a pad?

Stephanie shakes her head “no.” He sighs and tosses a pad and
pen to her. People start calling out their coffee orders to
Stephanie, who dutifully but distractedly writes them down.

INT. DENNIS NYLON HQ - WORK AREA - MOMENTS LATER 53

Stephanie peeks out the conference room, holding a long list
of coffee orders. She sees Diego and Dennis still conferrin
in Dennis’ office. She ducks down so that she’s hidden by the
low cubicles and darts into ...

INT. DENNIS NYLON HQ - EMILY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 54

Emily's office is immaculate, modern with no clutter. Her
desk is a glass top on chromé legs. A small drawer unit sits
under it next to her minimalist desk chair.

The wall in Emily’s office is glass and so Stephanie is
completely exposed. She hunches down and duck-walks to the
desk, staying below view of the workers in the cubicles.

Stephanie tries to open the top drawer but it’s locked. They
all are. She thinks, then pulls a hair pin out of her hair
and tries to jimmy the lock in the top drawer with it.
55

41.

She clearly has no idea how to pick a lock. After a beat, the
pin bends and springs out of her hand and lands out of reach.

STEPHANIE
Motherfudger ...

Just then, Valerie walks past Emily’s office, talking on her
headset, preoccupied and upset. Stephanie scrambles behind
the drawer unit, hunching down low.

VALERIE
Of course he’s freaking out! He needs
someone to manage this now ...

As Stephanie hunches lower to hide, she glances up at the
bottom of Emily’s desk. Her expression changes.

EMILY’S POV: Through the glass deskto Stephanie sees a
letter under Emily’s desk pad. It loo $ like it was hastily
shoved under there along with the envelope it came in.

Stephanie stares up at it, thinking.

STEPHANIE’S FLASHBACK VISION: Emily is at her desk, reading
the letter, worried, then hears Dennis heading for her
office. Scared, she quickly lifts the desk pad and hides the
letter under it, dropping it just as Dennis enters.

BACK TO SCENE: Stephanie reaches up and lifts the desk pad,
quickly pulling out the letter and envelope. She stuffs them
into her purse, then looks at Dennis’ office. It’s now empty.
Seeing Dennis and Diego nowhere, she rushes out of Emily’s
office.

INT. DENNIS NYLON HQ - WORK AREA - CONTINUOUS 55

Stephanie darts past the cubicles, speeding toward the exit.
She looks back at Dennis’ office. VALERIE IS NOW WATCHING
HER, STARING SCARILY. As Stephanie then turns to run ...

DIEGO STEPS OUT IN FRONT OF HER, grabbing her arms. She
GASPS. He stares at her threateningly as Dennis steps up.

DENNIS NYLON
Forget gomething, Aunt Frieda? You’re not
supposed to be back here, you know.

Stephanie looks terrified, then suddenly changes tact. Snaps.

STEPHANIE

to Dennis, in his face)
You listen to me, you bargain basement
Tom Ford. If you don’t have your goon
take his hands off me right now, I’m
gonna tell the moms who watch my vlog -
the thousands of moms - that Dennis Nylon
is an abusive creep who victimizes women
and that they Should spread the word all
over the internet to stop buying your
overpriced, poorly-made garbage. Because
if you losé moms, you lose business.

Dennis looks at her like she’s nuts but clearly responds to
the threat of potential bad press. He pulls Diego’s arm off
of Stephanie.
56

57

42.

DENNIS NYLON
I was just going to have him escort you
out. Jesus Christ. You’re the one who
trespassed, you know.

STEPHANIE
Well, tough nuts. It’s a free country.
And I’11 escort my-self out, thank you.
(to Diego, re: her arm)
And you'd better pray I don’t have a
bruise.

Stephanie pushes past them and heads for the exit. As she
walks away, she begins to smile to herself, suddenly feeling
very cool and empowered. She takes out the coffee order list,
looks at it, then crumples it up and tosses it coolly into a
trash can. She exits around the corner.

After a beat, she comes back around the corner and takes the
crumpled list out of the garbage. She _uncrumples it, smooths
it on her knee and hands it to an ASSISTANT.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
They’ re waiting for these in the
conference room. Please apologize to them
for the delay.

She gives the assistant an apologetic look and heads out.
INT. DENNIS NYLON HQ - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 56
Stephanie slips into the elevator, then pulls out the letter.
It’s an UNFLATTERING CANDID PICTURE OF EMILY, dressed in a

big army coat, her face drawn, hair unwashed. Underneath it
written in bold pen: “GOTTA HAVE FAITH.”

 

STEPHANIE
“Gotta have faith?”
(studying it)
No wonder you don’t like to have your
picture taken.

EXT. DOWNTOWN WARFIELD, CT - MAIN STREET - DAY 57

THE UNFLATTERING PHOTO OF EMILY, copied to the point of
blurriness, is STAPLED to a communi y bulletin board.

Stephanie goes store to store in the small downtown area
putting up fliers with the caption “HAVE YOU SEEN ME?” and a
otline number. Sean walks up and hands her a new stack. They
exchange a sad smile. He’s grateful to her for all this.

REVEAL Darren, Stacy and Sona watching from a Starbucks.

DARREN
Look at our little Stephanie, comforting
the worried husband.

STACY
Oh, please. It’s an Arts-and-Crafts
project. I’ve never seen her pass up a
chance to use a stapler.
58

DARREN
Think of the optimism that _goes into
making those fliers. It’s like they’re
looking for a lost parrot.

SONA
Emily's going to hate those fliers when
she comes back.

DARREN
She's not coming back. Don’t you ever
watch Dateline? If a case isn’t solved in
the first 72 hours, they’re always dead.
Sona looks sadly back at Stephanie, Sean standing nearby.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 58

 

A beautifully set table for four with steaming platters of
food, good silver, linen napkins and lit candles. Stephanie
uncorks a bottle of white wine and pours it in two wine
glasses at either end. Sean comes in the front door in
sweats, damp from a jog.

STEPHANIE
Oh, perfect timing. Dinner’s ready.

Sean stares at the table, then shakes his head.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Did I do something wrong?

SEAN
No, I just ... I’ve never had this
experience. Coming home to a set dinner
table. I feel like I’m in some “Twilight
Zone.” Or “Leave it to Beaver.”

STEPHANIE
Is it too much?

SEAN
It’s wonderful. Anythin stable is like a
gift from heaven these days.

STEPHANIE
You don’t believe in heaven.

SEAN
(giving her a smile)
Maybe I’m starting to. I'm going to take
a shower. I’1l be right back.

The DOORBELL rings. Sean goes to the door and opens it,
revealing a man in a suit, DETECTIVE MEANY, 40s, Cuban.
Stephanie watches anxiously as he flashes a badge.

SEAN (CONT'D)
Stephanie? Maybe you should help the boys
with their homework.

Stephanie hovers in the doorway a moment, eyes wide.

STEPHANIE
Of course.

Stephanie grabs the bread basket of rolls and heads up.

STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
Just a snack before dinner.

Meany nods to her, then watches her go, curious.

DETECTIVE MEANY
Cute nanny.

SEAN
No. She’s a friend of my wife’s. She's
been helping me out.

Meany nods. He clocks the open BOTTLE OF WHITE WINE on table,
the lit candles and fresh flowers. Meany smiles.

DETECTIVE MEANY
Maybe she can help out around my house,
too.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 59

 

Miles and Nicky sit on the edge of the bed munching rolls and
watching SpongeBob.

STEPHANIE
(anxious)
Eat over the napkin. Try not to crumb.

The boys ignore her and keep eating sloppily. Stephanie's
curiosity gets the best of her. She creeps out onto ...

THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING 60
She hovers in the shadows, trying to make out their VOICES.
DETECTIVE MEANY
The manifests from American Airlines say
she wasn’t on any flight to Miami.
SE.
Bloody hell.
DETECTIVE MEANY
But she did rent a White Kia from Budget.
She paid in_cash for a two-day rental.
People usually pay cash for one reason.

SEAN
You're saying she’s having an affair?

Stephanie leans so far forward she knocks into the railing.

DETECTIVE MEANY
I can’t say that with any confidence.

SEAN
Then don’t say it. I’m sure you’1l be
able to track that Kia.
61

45.

DETECTIVE MEANY
We're working on it. I have toll reports
coming in from across the country,
assuming she didn’t swap out the plates.
I'd like to send a description of your
wife to every precinct in the Tri-State
area. Any distinguishing features?

SEAN
Yes. She’s drop dead gorgeous.
Stephanie feels a pinch of envy.

. DETECTIVE MEANY
Any birth marks? Tattoos?

SEAN

No. Wait. Actually, yes. She has a tattoo
on her wrist. A bracelet of barbed wire.

(off of Meany’s look)
More eee jement? Look, Emily did things
like that. Crazy, impulsive things. It’s
part of what made her the most exciting
woman I’ve ever known.

His voice trails off, forlorn. Stephanie can study him from
this angle and she feels his loss. But she also feels a pang
of jealousy. She shakes it off.

DETECTIVE MEANY
Well, you’re on a roller coaster now.
(with another smile)
Tell your wife’s friend I said goodbye.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 61

Stephanie washes the dishes post-dinner in silence. Sean
comes in and pours himself the last of the wine.

SEAN
You don’t have to do this. You’re a saint.
STEPHANIE
I’m not a saint. I just like to keep my
hands busy.
SEAN

Where was she going in that damn Kia?
She'd never be caught dead in a car like
that. Ugh, bad choice of words.

STEPHANIE
She’s not dead. I know she’s not.

SEAN
Then she’s having one hell of an affair.
Or maybe she just had to get away from
me.

STEPHANIE
Sean, you are a wonderful, caring,
intelligent man. And Emily loves you
dearly. Don’t you ever undersell yourself
like that again. I won’t stand for it.

Sean stares at her, then smiles sadly. Nods. She smiles.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Good. I’m going to go home. It’s “Flags
of the World” day tomorrow at school and
I haven’t even started on Asia.

Stephanie moves to leave. As she passes Sean at the table, he
reaches out and takes her wrist. She gasps and stops short,
looking him in the eye. There’s genuine longing in his gaze.
He quickly lets go of her wrist apologetically.

SEAN
Sorry. It’s just ... no. I don’t mean
sorry. I mean thank you. For being such a
good friend, Stephanie. Not just to
Emily, but to me as well.

STEPHANIE
Of course. I’m a problem-solver. I just
wish I could do more.

SEAN
You're doing plenty. And you are a saint.

I/E. STEPHANIE’S VOLVO (MOVING) - DAY 62

Stephanie drives home, chewing her bottom lip, completely
conflicted. Miles is asleep in his car seat in the back seat.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
That’s where we are today, moms ...

INT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 63
We catch up to the VLOG from the very beginning.

STEPHANIE

So, we're keeping our heads high and not
jumping to conclusions. We're Soldiering on
with zucchini cookies. But if you want to
help, Emily was driving a WHITE KIA rented
at the Budget at La Guardia on April 24th.
I did some digging and found that the
license plate was New York F as in Frieda,
N as #2 Nicky, Z as in Zucchini, 1447. If
any of you moms happen to see it, I’ve got

asketful of rosemary shampoo bars with
your name on them.

INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 64

Stephanie wears a robe and a towel turban over her wet hair,
Nefertiti-style. She opens her taptop, checking her e-mail.
We HEAR the voice of one of her MOMS as Stephanie reads.

WOMAN'S VOICE (V. +)
“Dear Stephanie, I’m writing from
Standish, Michigan, with a possible Emily
sighting. I was in a gas station off the

described. The woman was wearin

Stephanie closes her laptop and makes a call.

STEPHANIE

65 INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 65

The boys play in the next room. Sean pours a drink: there’s
an even deeper level of anxiety on him. Stephanie sips tea.

STEPHANIE
Meany sent all the info to local
authorities in Michigan. Did Emily ever
mention Michigan? Maybe a friend trom
college?

SEAN
As far as I knew, Emily never had any
real friends. Not before you.

STEPHANIE
Well, that’s ... I’m flattered. But how
is that possible?

SEAN
She’s a workaholic.

Sean’s cell phone RINGS. Sees the number and answers quickly.

SEAN (CONT'D)

Hello? Tell me you found her ...

Did Emily have a Celine handbag?

STEPHANIE
(with dread)
The Nano Tote.

SEAN (ON PHONE)
Yes, that’s hers. A lake? I have no idea.
I‘ll head there now.

They found the rental car in Michigan.

Stephanie grabs Sean’s hand, squeezing it.
SEAN (CONT'D)

I have to go or I’m going to go crazy.
Can you do me a favor an

STEPHANIE
Done. I’1l take care of Nicky. Go.

STEPHANIE

Hi, Moms. Stephanie here. I can see we
have a flood of new viewers today, so
welcome. But I’m sorry, this is probably
not the best entry to start with.

EXT. WITCH LAKE (MICHIGAN) - DAY 67
A TOW TRUCK tows a mud-splashed WHITE KIA down the dirt road.
STEPHANIE (V:9-)
Those of you who’ve been following the
last few weeks, you know that my best
friend went missing.

EXT. LAKESIDE - MICHIGAN WOODS - DAY 68

 

A CSI PHOTOGRAPHER takes a shot of FOOTPRINTS on a dirt path.
STEPHANIE (V.O.)
So many of you wrote to me with your tips
or hunches.

INT. WITCH LAKE - CRAMPED SPACE - DAY 69

 

CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS tag and bag various personal items
strewn about a cabin lined with rusty bunk beds.

STEPHANIE (V.O.
Special thanks to Leanne Dippens, whose
helpful tip led to a major break in the
case.

A GLOVED CSI HAND empties Emily’s handbag of its contents:
CELL PHONE. LIP GLOSS. SUNGLASSES. LEGO MAN HOLDING A SWORD.

EXT. MICHIGAN LAKE FRONT - DAY 70

LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS loll around at the bank, casually
chatting or on cell phones as an exhausted Sean stands at the
water’s edge, arms folded, his face as pale as he watches the
lake.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
I have somber news ...

DIVERS in tanks and goggles drag the bottom. Faint bubbles
pepper the surface in spots. One of the divers surfaces and
waves his hand, pointing below. He found something.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
Emily was found.

Sean’s face falls as the truth hits him hard.

The Diver resurfaces with a BODY under his arm. The pale
corpse of a woman, her loose hair hiding her face like
seaweed. He swims toward the shore, tugging her along.

STEPHANIE vo)
Not alive, I’m afrai

The police move in to meet him and take the body onto the
land. Emily’s face is bloated, her eyes wide open, her lips
parted as if taking her last breath.

STEPHANIE (V.O. )
My friend, my best friend . is dead.
71

72

49,

Sean reaches for her lifeless hand with the barbed wire
tattoo. And his mother’s sapphire and diamond WEDDING RING.
Sean breaks down sobbing.

INT. MORTUARY - DAY 71

Sean is a wreck as he speaks to the MORTICIAN. Stephanie
hangs back a few feet, supportive.

MORTICIAN
An open casket helps give the loved ones
a sense of closure.

SEAN
I... God - I have to think for a second.

Sean heads out of the mortuary, leaving Stephanie alone with
the MORTICIAN. They stand together in silence.

MORTICIAN
Let him know we have the best embalmer.
Usually with drowning victims, the skin
is too fragile for an open casket. But
not us. We can give her a glow.

STEPHANIE
(uncomfortable)
She was very private. And very particular
about how she looked.

MORTICIAN
Oh, we only use the best brands of make-
up. And fillers. You’1ll never even know
out her missing tooth.

STEPHANIE
Missing tooth?
MORTICIAN
Yes, the right front one.
STEPHANIE
(baffled)

Did she lose it when she died?

MORTICIAN
Had to be an old injury. The bone was
growing over it. But we’ll cover it.
Think of us as life’s final fashion
runway.

EXT. WARFIELD CEMETERY - DAY 72

EMILY’S CASKET is lowered into a grave as a PRIEST delivers a
sermon. Darren, Sona, Stacy, other parents, Dennis Nylon,
Emily's co-workers, they’re all there.

Sean and Stephanie stand a safe distance apart. Nicky wears a
navy blue suit and a numb countenance as the pulley ropes are
removed and the casket settles in. Stephanie glances at Sean,
whose eyes are red. Puts her hand on his arm.

We see Dennis Nylon staring at Stephanie intently, thinkin
Stephanie looks over at him and he looks back at the pries
before Stephanie sees he was watching.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAY 73

Emily's funeral reception. People mill around. Stephanie sets
food out on the buffet table. Darren sets his homemade
brownies out on a crystal platter next to her. He and
Stephanie trade a look and a sad smile.

STEPHANIE
Are those ...?

DARREN
They are. From your “Last Minute
Brownies” entry.

STEPHANIE
I can’t believe you watch my vlog.

DARREN
Well, to be honest, I was making fun of
you at first. But then there were some
elpful tips in there - especially when
Lulu had that rash. Apple Cider Vinegar.
Who knew?

Stephanie gives him a sad smile as Sona walks up.

DARREN (CONT'D)
You're a saint to help out her family.

STEPHANIE
I’m not a saint. Emily was my friend.
She'd do the same thing for me.

SONA
If you or Sean ever need me to watch
Miles or Nicky any time, it’s nothing.

STEPHANIE
Thanks, Sona.

EXT. EMILY’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 74

Nicky rips branches off a_ tree one by one. Angry and
frustrated, he needs a release. Miles approaches Nicky from
behind, also in his suit.

MILES
Nicky. You don’t need to worry. Your
Mom’s in heaven. With my Dad and Uncle
Chris.

NICKY
No, she’s not. She’s in the ground. She’s
never coming back.

MILES NICKY (CONT'D)
She's in heaven now - Shut up!

Nicky flies at Miles and shoves him to the ground.

MILES
OWWWW! Stop!!!
75

51.

Nicky straddles Miles and smacks him across the face, open-
palmed, left then right then left then right until Miles’
nose starts gushing blood.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 75
Stephanie notices the scuffle out the window and races --
OUT TO THE BACKYARD

SEAN

(racing over)
What the hell are you doing!?

Sean yanks Nicky off Miles and holds him back.

SEAN (CONT'D)
Calm down.

Stephanie moves to Miles and helps him up off the ground,
kneeling to look at his nose. Nicky points at Stephanie.

NICKY
she made this happen. She made my mom
ie!

Stephanie feels dizzy. She glances around and notices Darren
watching all this from the kitchen window.

SEAN
Oh, Jesus, Nicky - that’s crazy.
NICKY
She's trying to be my new mom.
STEPHANIE
I’m not trying to be your new mom,
sweetie.
NICKY

You're trying to be everybody’s Mom. But
you're not mine!

SEAN NICKY (CONT'D)
Nicky, stop. I know you're I want my mom!
upset, but -

SEAN
I know you do, but you need to calm down.
Sean struggles to hold onto Nicky who kicks wildly.

_ NICKY
Mom was right. You’re a loser!

Sean hurls Nicky on the ground, snapping. Stephanie gasps.

SEAN
Is that what your mother said? Is that
when she was drunk at two in the
afternoon? I’m doing the best I can!

STEPHANIE
Sean, shhh. He’s a little boy.
76

52.

All at once, Sean realizes what he’s done.

SEAN
Oh my God, what am I doing? What have I
done? Nicky ... Jesus.

Nicky hurls himself on the ground and hides his face with his
hands. Sean touches his arm. Nicky swats him away.

NICKY
Get away from me!

Sean looks up at Stephanie, completely lost. Some of the
guests watch from a distance.

SEAN
What do I do?

STEPHANIE
Let’s everybody take a deep centering
breath. We’re going to do one thing at a
time. Let me talk to Nicky; and Sean, you
get some ice for Miles’ nose. He’s got a
good little shiner coming.

Sean puts his hand on Miles’ shoulder, walking him inside.
Stephanie sits down on the grass next to Nicky.

NICKY
I don’t want to talk to you.

STEPHANIE
Well, you’re not my favorite dinner date
eithér, Mister. But I think you should
know everything you’re feeling right now
is normal. You can act up all you want -
but it won't change what I know.

NICKY
(suspicious)
What do you know?

STEPHANIE
That you’re a good kid.

From a distance, SEAN turns to see Stephanie calmly sitting
across from Nicky, like a snake-charmer. He stares sadly.

STEPHANIE FROM A DISTANCE) (CONT’D)
So let’s sit here and not talk. Let’s

just sit here and feel lousy and watch

the grass grow. Sometimes you just need

to feel what you’re feeling. Until it

gets better. ome is the only medicine.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - STAIRS - DUSK 76

 

Stephanie carries a sleeping, spent Nicky upstairs INTO HIS
ROOM. She lays him on his bunk. Miles is asleep in the upper
bunk. Stephanie kisses Nicky’s forehead and slips out ...
77

53.

INTO THE HALLWAY

Sean is standing silhouetted against the light from the
master bedroom. His eyes bloodshot, tear-filled. She moves to
him and hugs him.

STEPHANIE ;
You got to break some eggs sometimes.
Don’t be hard on yourself. These are the

sorts of things nobody ever gets right.

SEAN
You do. You always do.

He sinks into her. This feels all too familiar and dangerous.
Her heart pounds against his. Sean can feel it too. His need
for her is turning physical. His hands slide down, resting on
the small of her back.

STEPHANIE
Sean, I don’t know ...

SEAN ;
I’ll stop. I’1l stop if you’re sure you
want me to.

His hands move lower ... to her ass. She inhales sharply but
doesn’t stop him. His hand slides between her legs. It’s been
a long time. His fingers move rhythmically. Her breathing
picks up. He hikes up her black dress, eaSing down her
underpants. She grabs his wrist to stop him.

SEAN (CONT'D)
Right, you're right. We shouldn’t.

She stares in his eyes. Her heart pounding loud in her ears,
she then kisses him hungrily. They attack each other ...

INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM 77

 

Sean hurls her on the bed and climbs on top of her. As she
reaches down to unbuckle his belt, he grabs her wrists and
pins them to the bed. She VISUALIZES --

SEAN PINNING EMILY’S WRISTS TO THE BED THE EXACT SAME WAY.
Stephanie tries to shake off the image as he kisses down her
body to between her legs. She writhes in brutal ecstasy as he
goes down on her, pinning her hands down.

STEPHANIE
Oh my god ... oh my god... no...

She fights it but it’s too late. Her body arches and twitches
with a groan of intense pleasure. Yells in ecstacy.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D
Ohhh, SUGAR-FREE CHRISTMAS CAKE!

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER 78

 

Stephanie and Sean lie in bed next to each other. Staring at
the ceiling in stunned disbelief. After several beats ...
79

81

54.

STEPHANIE
Well, I think it was a lovely service.
Very tasteful.

SEAN
Yes, it was.

They keep staring up at the ceiling ...

STEPHANIE (PRE-LAP)

Hi Moms. Stephanie here. In a time of so
much grief, it’s important to find that
silver lining.

INT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 79

The SECOND-GRADERS are dressed in yellow T-shirts with hand
painted suns. They ;Sing “It’s a Sunshine Day” while
performing it in sign language. Ms. Kerry leads in front.

SECOND GRADERS
sBverybody ’ s laughing/It’ s a sunshine
day /Every! ody’s singing/It’s a sunshine
ay ...

The parents crowd the auditorium shooting videos on iPhones.
Stephanie is in her photo vest, equipped with a telephoto
lens; but she’s lost some of hér over! earing quality.

She steals glances at Sean. He glances back, then feels
Darren's eyes on him. Stephanie smiles until her eyes fall on
Nicky: He’s singing with all his heart. Her smile falls,
thinking of Emily.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 80
Miles and Nicky watch Sponge Bob and laugh hysterically.
Nicky tax enters with a tray of TEMPEH. With his eyes on her,
Nic takes one off the trays eating it, swallowing with
difficulty ... then giving her a small Smile.

It’s a small gesture, but it means the world to both.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY 81
Sean's jogging shorts hang around his ankles. Stephanie's
perched on the rumbling washing machine while Sean has sex
with her. She folds her ankles behind him, pulling him in.

SEAN
Don’t do that. You’re gonna make me come.

STEPHANIE
Fair is fair.

SEAN
(suddenly climaxin
Ohhh, sugar-free Christmas cake!

He slumps against her, then gives her a playful smile.
82

55.

STEPHANIE
(with a laugh)
Oh god. You’re terrible.

She playfully swats the back of his head. He winks and kisses
her shoulder. She smiles to herself, feeling powerful. Happy.

INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 82

Pandora plays on Stephanie’s iPhone. Beyonce’s “GIRLS (RUN

THE WORLD).” Stephanie dances as she washes some dishes.
STEPHANIE

Girls! We run this mother / Girls! We run
this mother / Girls! We run this mother -

Her back is turned when Sean opens the kitchen door, home
from work. He watches her piving- Cracks a smile. She feels
him there and turns, mortified.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Oh my God. It was --

(grabs phone; stops it)
I like to listen to hip hop when I cook.
How embarrassing.

SEAN
No, keep it on. I like when you “twerk.”

STEPHANIE
Oh lord. He can I make you a_drink?
Emily taugh "me how to make a Duke's
martini.

A flash of pain crosses Sean’s face at the mention of Emily.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Gosh, that was really insensitive of me.

SEAN
No, it’s fine. And I'd love one.

Stephanie opens the freezer and takes out Emily’s gin and
glass. Stares at it, then starts to make the martini.

STEPHANIE

Sean ... how did she lose her tooth?
SEAN

What?
STEPHANIE

Emily. The mortician said that she was
missing her front tooth. She sure had a
good falsie. I had no idea.

SEAN
I wasn’t aware she had a fake tooth.

STEPHANIE
Is that something she’d hide from you?
83

84

85

56.

SEAN
She hid everything from me. Sometimes I’m
amazed I know as much about her as I do.

Stephanie sees his pain as he looks off distantly. Softens.
STEPHANIE
I made you guys cashew chicken with stir-—
fry veggies. It’s almost ready. Miles and
I will’ get out of your hair.
SEAN
I’d rather the two of you stay for
dinner. My hair can take it.
Stephanie turns and smiles. Sean smiles back hopefully.

STEPHANIE
I was really hoping you’d say that.

EXT. WARFIELD, CT - STREETS - DAY 83

A beautiful morning in Warfield. The FLIERS OF EMILY, torn
and weathered, flapping sadly in the wake of passing cars.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 84

 

Stephanie stands in the center of Emily’s living room, taking
it all in. It’s impressive. She sees the Sonos remote. She
runs her finger along it remembering Emily. Then she pushes
the “on” button. A 60s FRENCH POP SONG begins to play.

Emily listens sadly, then starts to enjoy the son She does

a little turn and ends up face to face with THE NI DE PAINTING
OF EMILY, which stares back at her. Looking caught, Stephanie
thinks for a second, then takes down the painting.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 85

 

Sunlight pours into the ultra hip modern bedroom as the
FRENCH POP SONG continues playing from the ceiling speakers.
Stephanie slips off her worn moccasins and tiptoes, carrying
the painting to -

EMILY’S CLOSET

Stephanie looks with some trepidation at the array of slick
designer clothes. Then, with a look of determination, she
stops in for the first time as if into a tomb, She rests the
PAINTING against the wall. She’s so cautious it’s as if she’s
certain it’s haunted. She pivots and she’s face to face with -—

- a Dolce & Gabbana fitted silk dress.

She holds it up to herself in the mirror. She can’t believe
she's doing this. She pauses, reverent, respectful. But
suddenly, excitement gets the better of her and she strips
down to her bra and panties, unzips the dress, and steps into
it. She tries to tug up the zipper but she can’t get it up.
Frustrated, she yanks the zipper up by force.

She studies her reflection in the mirror, jiking what she
sees. She stands on tiptoe, simulating high heels
86

57.

Stephanie moves to the closet where the designer shoes are
kept in their boxes: Prada, Jimmy Choo, YSL. She makes an
Emily face and strikes poses in the mirror in time with the
French song.

STEPHANIE
(channeling Emily)
“One’s not enough, ree’s too many,
two's just right. Just like tits.”

She smiles. The DOORBELL RINGS. Stephanie panics. She
desperately tries to unzip the dress. Not happening.

Stephanie races to the window and looks down. Sees a SEDAN
parked out front and Detective Meany at the front door. She
GASPS as HE LOOKS UP AND SEES HER.

DETECTIVE MEANY
Ms. Smothers? Can I talk to you?

STEPHANIE
(forced casual)
Sure thing! Coming right down.
(to herself)
Shit, shit, shit. Oopsy.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAY 86

Trapped in the dress, Stephanie races downstairs, barefoot,
sti tugging at the zipper. She dives at the Sonos remote,
turns it off and yanks open the door.

STEPHANIE
Hi! Sorry! I was just - I left something
here and Sean gave me the key. For when I
bring Nicky home. We have an arrangement.
A deal! I meant a very domestic deal.

DETECTIVE MEANY
You’re not under arrest, Ms. Smothers.

STEPHANIE
Ha! Ha ha. Well, I should hope not.
(suddenly sérious)
Sean's not home.

DETECTIVE MEANY
I was hoping to speak to you, actually. I
went by your house and the school. Some
of the moms said you might be here.

STEPHANIE
Oh, really. Who? It was Stacy, wasn’t it?

DETECTIVE MEANY
Can I come in?

STEPHANIE
Of course. Entre vous. Ha ha.

Stephanie clears the door, sweating, as Meany enters.

DETECTIVE MEANY
I had a few follow-up questions.
58.

STEPHANIE
Well, I have more than a few myself.

Stephanie has a hard time sitting in the extremely tight
dress, but she manages an awkward pose on the divan.

_. _DETECTIVE MEANY
You said Emily was your best friend.

STEPHANIE
She is. Was. It’s hard to get used to -

DETECTIVE MEANY
Was she depressed?

STEPHANIE .
No. She had it all: the job, the house -

DETECTIVE MEANY
The husband.

STEPHANIE
I was getting there.

DETECTIVE MEANY
The neighbors say they fought a lot.

STEPHANIE
Oh, they had their issues. But they loved
each other. Intensely.

. DETECTIVE MEANY
Too intensely?

STEPHANIE
I think the exact right amount of
“intensely.”

DETECTIVE MEANY
What “issues” did they have?

STEPHANIE
Normal issues. They were stressed out
about money. Emily wanted to slow down.

Detective Meany produces a DOCUMENT.

DETECTIVE MEANY
She slowed down all right. Here’s the
autopsy report.
(reading)

“Severe liver damage Suggesting heavy use
of alcohol. Track marks along her arms
and between her toes.” Were you aware of
her heroin use?

Stephanie’s eyes are as wide as a deer in the headlights.
STEPHANIE
Uh, I... no. I really don’t believe
that. She liked very strong martinis, b--

DETECTIVE MEANY
They found the needle.
87

88

59.

STEPHANIE
(reeling)
But -- how could she keep that a secret?
Not just from me. From Sean ...

DETECTIVE MEANY
You seem to know Sean pretty well.

STEPHANIE
(composing herself)
I’ve gotten to know him over the last few
weeks -- as friends helping each other
through a crisis.

DETECTIVE MEANY
Uh huh. I’m guessing youtve never dealt
with law enforcement before.

INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK) 87

 

A YOUNGER STEPHANIE opens the door to TWO POLICEMAN with
grave expressions. Without sound, they begin telling her
about the accident with her husband and brother.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT 88

 

Stephanie regains her composure.

STEPHANIE
Not really, no.

DETECTIVE MEANY
Then 1/11 simp plity this. Did Emily know
you were banging her husband?

Stephanie struggles to keep her wits.

STEPHANIE

That Ss a very rude way to put it.

(a deep breath)
The answer is no. Because it started
after she died. People grieve in very
different ways. We’ve been discreet;
we've been respectful of her memory.
No one knows. Not a single person in
Warfield, not even the children.

He stares at her a moment with a half-smile, toying with her.
Meany finally leans in, going for the knockout.

DETECTIVE MEANY
Were you aware that Sean took out an
extra four million dollar life insurance
policy on Emily before she disappeared?

Stephanie goes ash white.

STEPHANIE
No, I ... I didn’t know that.
(mocking)
So, what are you saying? Sean hired a
“hitman”? That he rubbed her out?

DETECTIVE MEANY
I never said that. But you just did.
89

90

60.

STEPHANIE
Look, I don’t appreciate your attitude,
quite frankly, Mr. Meany. { ou want to
grill anybody, ou should ta to Emily's
boss, Dennis Nylon. He couldn’t be more
suspicious.

DETECTIVE MEANY
That’s interesting because he contacted
us and said that he thought you may know
more about all this than you’re letting

on.
(off her shocked look)

As long as you’re being honest with me,

Ms. Smothers, you've got nothing to worry

about. I’m just following bread crumbs,

wherever they lead.

Meany stands up, leaving Stephanie in her confounded state.

DETECTIVE MEANY (CONT’D)
I’m done for now. Thank you for your
time. Nice dress, by the way. Her clothes
look good on you.

As he heads for the door, Stephanie erupts:

STEPHANIE
Your theory doesn’t hold water. How does
it explain the fake plane ticket? The
rental car? Why drive to a Summer Camp in
Michigan to do heroin? There’s plenty of
good heroin right here in Connecticut!
++. I’m told.

DETECTIVE MEANY
I'll be in touch. Enjoy the new house.

As he heads out the door, she calls after him.

STEPHANIE
Those are the worst bread crumbs ever.
You couldn't fill a Caesar salad with

them.
As he vanishes, Stephanie is deep in thought, confused,
disgusted and finally ... determined. FRENCH POP KICKS IN.
INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 89

 

With kitchen shears, Stephanie cuts the Dolce dress up the
front and rips it off herself like Hulk. RRRIIIIIP!!!

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - HOME OFFICE - DAY 90

Stephanie goes ; through drawers, searching through Emily's
files and receipts, finding nothing much of interest. Pulls
out a large manila envelop that’s already been opened from a
pile. Written on the envelope is “EM - CAN YOU SIGN THESE? -—
INSURANCE GUY NEEDS THEM ASAP - THANKS! S.” She looks inside
the envelope but it’s empty. She looks a bit freaked.

FROM OUTSIDE, WE SEE STEPHANIE THROUGH THE OFFICE WINDOW. IS
THIS SOMEONE’S POV OR NOT? WE ARE UNSURE.
91

92

93

61.

Stephanie stares at the writing on the envelope, thinking.
Suddenly, BANG! Stephanie GASPS as something hits the window.
Heart pounding, she stands and looks out the window.

STEPHANIE’S POV: A BIRD is on the ground, dazed from hitting
the window. It flops around a bit, recovers and flies off.

Stephanie catches her breath, recovering from the shock. Then
she looks at the writing on the envelope again, puts it back
in the pile and heads for the door.

EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE - DAY 91

Happy, busy looking COEDS cross the paths en route to
classes. Stephanie moves across the campus, deep in thought.

EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE - ENGLISH DEPT. - DAY 92

 

As Stephanie rounds the corner, she sees Sean with a very
attractive FEMALE T.A -- cool clothes, highlighted blonde
hair. A younger version of Emily. Sean and the girl walk out,
deep in flirty conversation. The girl laughs at a joke he
makes and then touches his arm gently. They hug.

Stephanie watches with a pit in her stomach.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 93

 

All seated around the table, Stephanie, Sean, Miles and Nicky
eat in silence. Stephanie looks tense, pre- occupied.

MILES
Mom, Nicky’s glass isn’t on the coaster.

STEPHANIE
What? Oh, Nicky, put Mr. Glass on Mr.
Coaster please.

Nicky rolls his eyes and moves his glass onto the coaster as
he crunches on his salad, confused.

NICKY
Are these amino acids in this salad?

STEPHANIE
Those are just bread crumbs.

Determined, he keeps crunching. Stephanie hesitates, then ...

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
(to Sean)
So how was work today?

SEAN
Grim. I had to explain the difference
between “your” possessive and “you're”
ap postrophe R-E to a college junior.
Remarkable. That’s where my writing time
has gone. To proofreading illiterates.

STEPHANIE
I can see how that might ... drive a man
over the edge.
62.

She's doing everything she can to contain her roiling soul.

SEAN
And what did you guys learn in school
today? Other than unmerited self-esteem.

NICKY
(mouth full)
I saw my Mom.

The dinner table goes silent. Sean and Stephanie meet eyes,
then look back at the boy, crunching on croutons.

SEAN
I understand, buddy. We sometimes think
we see people we miss ... even if they’re
gone.

NICKY

(crunching loudly)
No, I saw her.

Stephanie is holding her breath. The crunching is maddening,
inescapable, like a tell-tale heart.

NICKY (CONT’D)
She was right outside the fence by the
kickball yard. At recess.

SEAN
Lots of people look like other people ...

NICKY
Nobody looks like Mom.

He finally looks up at a_ stunned Sean and Stephanie as the
crunching stops and he slurps his drink.

NICKY (CONT’D)
She told me say hi to Stephanie.

Stephanie drops her knife onto her plate with a clank.

SEAN
Nicky, this isn’t healthy.

NICKY
Miles saw her too. Right, Miles?

Miles looks scared to be drawn into this.

MILES
I think I did, but ... I don’t know. I
was playing tetherball.

STEPHANIE
Did you two hatch this up? Is this some
game you’re playing? Like when you smash
everything with trucks. You know what we
say about lying?

NICKY
I’m not lying! Fuck you, I saw her!

SEAN
Hey!

Nicky leaves the table and races upstairs. The other three
sit at the table in pained silence.

EXT. EMILY’S HOUSE - TRASH AREA - DUSK 94

A preoccupied Stephanie is taking out the trash after dinner.
Suddenly, THERE'S MOVEMENT in the bushes.

STEPHANIE
Hello? Is somebody there?

She moves forward cautiously when suddenly, WHOOSH! A BIRD
bursts out of the bushes and flaps past her. Stephanie GASPS,
then hustles back inside the house, freaked.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
AGH! STUPID BIRDS!

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - NICKY’S BEDROOM - DUSK 95

Both in their pajamas, Nicky and Miles clamber into their
bunk beds. Stephanie kisses Miles good night.

MILES
‘Night, Mom.

STEPHANIE
‘Night, Smooch.

Stephanie gets up and heads for the door.

NICKY, ;
Don’t I get a kiss good night?

Stephanie heads over to his bed.
STEPHANIE
Qf course, you do. But you owe the oopsy
jar a quarter for earlier.

Stephanie leans over Nicky and pecks him on the cheek. As she
does, she smells something. Emily’s perfume?

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DUSK 96

 

Preoccupied, Stephanie checks the pockets of the boys’
clothes before she throws them into the washer. She pauses at
Nicky’s school clothes. Smells them. Emily’s perfume again.

Then she turns inside-out the pockets from NICKY’S CORDUROYS
to find: THE CHEVRON FRIENDSHIP BRACELET.

Stephanie heads into the room. She pauses at the window for a
moment. Sean comes up behind her and pulls her close.

SEAN
Let’s get naked.

STEPHANIE
Sean, wait. We need to have a talk about
Nicky’s laundry.

SEAN
About his laundry? Can we please hit
pause on the “Captain Mom” thing?

STEPHANIE
The Captain Mom thing?

SEAN
(sighs; knows he fucked up)
That’s just what Emily used to call you.
She was masking her own guilt. Because
you're such a saint.

STEPHANIE
I’m NOT a saint. And she knew that. If
anybody knew it, it was her!

Sean is confused by her demeanor.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)

I smell her, Sean. I smell her on Nicky.
Her perfume ... it’s like a ghost all
over him, all over his corduroys.

EAN
He probably got into the bottle in the
medicine cabinet. He misses her. You're
getting paranoid.

STEPHANIE
Am I? Because I also found this.

She holds out the CHEVRON FRIENDSHIP BRACELET.

SEAN
What is that?

STEPHANIE
A friendship bracelet I made for Emily.

SEAN
I hate to say it but she wouldn’t have
kept that. She hated that stuff. I’m sure
she gave it to him right after you gave
it to her.

STEPHANIE
Or maybe he’s telling the truth.

SEAN
Stephanie, you saw her with your own

STEPHANIE
There was something ... off.

SEAN
She was dead. They found her at the
bottom of a lake. You saw her crazy
tattoo - and the ring she stole from my
mother.

STEPHANIE
She said your mother wanted her to have
that ring. She said she insisted.

Sean sits on the bed. He laughs darkly and shakes his head.

SEAN

God. Is that what she told you? That was
the ring my father gave my mother. It’s
the only piece of jewelry she ever owned.

Oh, Mum’s not getting this. She’1l take

Excuse me. Not amusing, my darling.

EMILY
Not joking, my darling. I took it and I
have no intention of giving it back.

SEAN
Of course you'll give it back. I’11 tell
Mum it dropped in your purse by accident,
that you au ain’ t find it until now.

EMILY
if you tell your mother that I found it,
tell her I stole it. What do you
think will be worse for her? Thinking she
lost her ring or knowing that her son
married a thief?

Sean is stunned by her cold cruelty. Emily slips off her
modest ENGAGEMENT RING and dons Sean’s mother’s antique.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Meet me in the bathroom in twenty
seconds. Knock twice.

Emily gets up and disappears up the aisle into the BATHROOM
STALL, shutting the door. Sean stares after her, his world
spinning on its axis. He married a monster.

He makes a decision, gets up and heads to the bathroom door.
Knocks twice. The door opens. He disappears inside.

Sean and Stephanie hold each other's gaze.

STEPHANIE
How could you stay with her?

SEAN
She fascinated me. She was the one woman
I could never figure out. And as_an
arrogant young writer, that’s all that
mattered to me at the time. She was my
mystery ¢ but I was her dream. I could
never live up to what she wanted from me.
I could never be myself.

Stephanie just stares back at him, listening.

And I was always looking over m
shoulder. I never slept well. With you,
it’s different. I sleep like a log.

STEPHANIE
That’s what every woman wants to hear.

SEAN
(smiles sweetly)
You know what I’m saying. You see me. You
understand me. You’ve rebuilt me,
Stephanie. I even started writing again,
part of a first chapter.

STEPHANIE
You did? That’s ... wonderful.

SEAN
You took a broken man and you put him
back together. I’m a better person, a
better father. I’ve never known a woman
with your compassion and your strength.

Stephanie swallows hard, touched by his words. She nods.

SEAN (CONT'D)
Move in with me.

STEPHANIE
What? Sean. It’s too soon. What will
people think?

SEAN
They already think it. Why do we have to
lie? I’m tired of pretending, I want to
be this man, the man I am with you.

He strokes her cheek. She pulls back. Stiffens. Then ...

STEPHANIE
I don’t do threesomes. We should get that
out in the open right now.

SEAN
What are you talking about?

STEPHANIE
Your T.A.? You and Emily had your little
«+. thing with her.

Good Lord, the cops have really done a
number on you. It’s because of you,
Stephanie. When you told Emily you were
living off your husband’s insurance
money, she realized that she and I both
needed policies. For Nicky’s sake. It was
the most responsible thing we ever did.
Thanks to you. Now is the interrogation
over, Detective Smothers?

(taking her hands)
Move in with me. We can start a new
wonderful life together. You and me and
the boys. Please say yes.

Stephanie stares into his eyes. She so wants this all to be
true that she can’t resist. She nods and hugs him.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Oh my God.

In shock, Stephanie picks up the gun awkwardly, pinching the
barrel. She glances around the room, trying to figure out
where to put it.

She eyes the night stand drawer alongside Emily’s bed. She
opens it to find a GIANT HOT PINK GLASS DILDO. Stephanie

GASPS and returns the lady pistol to its original shoe box

you a few things. We all miss you more

replace you. But he no longer cries at

wouldn't want that. And I want you to
know that I_am preparing the most
nutritious food for him. I can never take

dangerous looking knife. ays with it absentmindedly as she
talks. Stephanie looks nervous, her eyes on the knife.

DIANA
She was just this beautiful sphinx, a
uzzle I could never figure out. And that
just made her more fucking compelling.

STEPHANIE
Yeah, I keep hearing that.

DIANA
She lured me in at a gallery show. I'd
started to sell some paintings. First
time in my career there was a buzz. And
there she was ... like a muse. Shit, I
fell so hard. I had to have her.

Every part of her. She just burrowed down
into me, under my skin.

See a montage of DIANA’S PAINTINGS OF EMILY’S BODY PARTS:
eroticized FEET, HANDS, THE ARCH OF A LOWER BACK. As Diana
paints, Emily smiles coyly and turns her face away.

Except she never wanted me to show her
face. Refused. My new paintings started
getting bad reviews. Critics were writing
me off as_ some shitty erotic artist. They
said I’d lost my soul.

An increasingly agitated Diana walks toward Stephanie,
gesticulating with the knife at Stephanie as she speaks.
Stephanie tries to play cool but backs up slowly.

DIANA (CONT'D)
She stole it from me. She fucking stole
my soul because she wouldn’t let me show
hers. But I didn’t care. I gave her
everything just to keep her happy, just
to keep her here. But I could never reach
her. She was like ...

one I ever did of her face. Tf was
convinced it was the one that was going
to put me back_on the map but then it was
gone and I couldn’t recreate it. Not
without her. I bottomed out. I wanted to
kill her, to track her down and actually
kill her. But the guilt of feeling that,
well ... I almost_offed myself. Funny -
that painting would be worth a lot more
if I had. Maybe that was her plan. She
was always looking for a big score. All
she wanted was to be rich.

STEPHANIE (ON HER PHONE)
Sean, Stephanie. I thought about what you
said and you're right. These are stages
of grief. This whole experience has been
stressful for both of us. I need to hit
the reset button, as Emily would say. I
need a day or two to be by myself. I’m
going to have Sona pick up the boys and
et them sleep at her place tonig t so
they can play with Hector and Ashley. You
should take some time too. There’s mango
and quinoa stew in the freezer. Five
minutes in the micro. Don’t forget to
stir. Lots of love.

INT. STEPHANIE’S VOLVO (MOVING) - HIGHWAY - DUSK 125

Stephanie drives, on a mission. The radio plays a HIP-HOP
STATION. Rihanna’s “BITCH BETTER HAVE MY MONEY.”

STEPHANIE
“Bitch better have my money! / Y'all
should know me well enough / Bitch better
have my money! Please don't call me on my
bluff / Pay me what you owe me / Turn up
to Rihanna while the whole club fuckin'
wasted ... “

So much for the oopsy jar.
EXT. MICHIGAN MOTEL - LOT - DUSK 126

Stephanie pulls into a Michigan roadside motel, seedy and
almost empty. She gets out and heads to the MAIN OFFICE.

INT. MICHIGAN MOTEL - STEPHANIE’S ROOM - NIGHT 127

 

Stephanie sits on the bed in a dingy room, making a call from
the land line. A commercial for LITTLE DEBBIE CHOCOLATE
CUPCAKES plays on the TV. Stephanie stares at it, then ...

STEPHANIE
Oh, hi there, my name is - Deborah.
Little Deborah.

Panicking, she glances quick at a cheesy painting of rolling
hills. Lying like this is new to her and she’s lousy at it.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
I mean, Hills. Deborah Hills.

My friends call me Little. Off-topic,
sorry. So ... I’m looking for a summer
camp for my son who is refusing his Bible
study like Lima beans. I hate to be pushy
but I travel a lot and I won’t be back in
town. for a while. Could I tour your
facility tomorrow morning?

EXT. SQUAW LAKE BIBLE CAMP - ESTABLISHING - DAY 128

 

Stephanie’s car drives through the front gates of a rundown
campground. A sign reads “SQUAW LAKE BIBLE CAMP” with a big
crucifix on it. The place is the definition of creepy.

EXT. SQUAW LAKE BIBLE CAMP - DAY 129

The owners of the cam MARYANNE and BOBBY CHELKOWSKY, both
40s, upbeat and out o " shape in their Squaw Lake Bible Camp
attire, stroll alongside Stephanie through the campground
toward the lake where Emily’s body was found.

MARYANNE
We've been saving young souls going on
fifty years now. Not Bobby and me
personally, the camp. But we’ve still
een here a while and we'd be happy to
help your son see the light too.

STEPHANIE
Well, it just seems perfect.
(looking at the lake)
My son is practically a por, poise. He's
going to love swimming in this pond.

MARYANNE
That’s Abel Lake. It’s where we have our
canoeing competition and our baptisms.
The kids all joke that it’s holy water.

BOBBY
(his favorite joke)
Any fish you pull out of there is
guaranteed to feed a multitude.

STEPHANIE
Ha ha, that’s a good one. So funny.
(then)
Is it safe, though? Didn’t I read
somewhere that someone just drown in it?
130

81.

Bobby and Maryanne exchange a worried look. Try to recover.

MARYANNE
Oh, that had nothing to do with the camp.
We were closed at the time. Just some
oor soul who wandered in here and found
er salvation in the lake. But don’t
worry. We watch our kids like a hawk.

BOBBY
Yeah, we’re so on top of them, they can
barely have any fun.

Maryanne gives him a “shut up, you idiot” look.

STEPHANIE
Well, that’s great news. Hey, do you have
any old photo albums or yearbooks I can
look at? I think there’s no better review
of a camp than the faces of the campers.

BOBBY
Oh, heck yeah. Got_a ton of them down in
the basement. You‘1l see nothing but
smiles in all of ‘em. I guarantee it.

INT. MAIN OFFICE - BASEMENT - DAY 130

An overhead bare bulb illuminates the musty basement. Cobwebs
and dust coat everythin Stephanie sifts through a box of
old books. She pulis out a stack of “SQUAW LAKE BIBLE CAMP
YEARBOOKS,” scanning to SUMMER 2000.

Stephanie flips through book after book. Not quite sure what
she’s looking for, studying the young faces.

Finally a SINGLE IMAGE grabs her: TWO IDENTICAL TWIN GIRLS
(AGE 9), their arms around each other. They’re lean, fair,
blue-eyed. There’s a vague resemblance to Emily. Could it "be?

Suddenly the names grab Stephanie: HOPE AND FAITH MCLENNAN.

STEPHANIE
Hope and ... Faith?

Stephanie pulls out the UNFLATTERING FAXED PICTURE: “GOTTA
HAVE FAITH.” STEPHANIE TAKES OUT HER PHONE AND SNAPS A

PICTURE OF THE TWINS. She starts rifling through the pages,
seeing and SNAPPING PHONE PICS of a SERIES OF AWARDS PAGES:

The MCLENNAN SISTERS won nearly every ribbon: FASTEST
CANOEING DUO, BEST SWIMMERS, HOT DOG EATING CHAMPIONS, THREE-
LEGGED RACE WINNERS ... the list is an endless procession of
grim summer accolades. Stephanie SNAPS A PIC. Must be Emily.

BOBBY (0.S.)
Take a picture, it’1ll last longer. Oh,
you already are.

She startles and looks up the creepy staircase at Bobby. He
smiles at his joke but suddenly seems more menacing as he
blocks the only way out of the basement. He walks down.
131

82.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

You must be mother "of the gosh-darn-year.
Most parents drop their kids off here ...
they barely slow down the car.

STEPHANIE

Well, my son gets homesick. I like to
prepare him. I hope you don’t mind me
taking some snaps. I thought I’d show him
a bunch of these fun photos.

(showing the yearbook)
Boy, these McLennan sisters sure got on a
winning streak. They must have been popular.

Bobby looks ashen - as if he’s seen a ghost. His eyes narrow.

BOBBY
Nowadays we put a’ emphasis on playing
fair.

STEPHANIE

Are you suggesting they cheated in the
hot dog eating competition?

BOBBY
I don’t recall.

STEPHANIE
The contest? Or the twins?

He stares at her coldly now, fun no more. A tense smile.

BOBBY
I truly hope your boy will join us here.
We've gotta get back to work now. Thank
you for your visit.

Bobby gestures for Stephanie to leave. Stephanie forces a
grateful smile and turns to put back the yearbook. As she’s
closing the book, she sees _a banner at the top of a page:
“Squaw Lake Biblé Camp would like to thank the MCLENNAN
FAMILY for their generous donation.” She clocks this.

INT. MICHIGAN MOTEL - STEPHANIE’S ROOM - DAY 131
Stephanie sits in front of Google and a long list of CROSSED-
OUT NAMES, beginning at Adam Mclennan and spanning down to
“McLennan Foundation.” She dials another number. Someone
answers but drops the phone.

STEPHANIE
Is this the McLennan Foundation?

There’s a fumbling pause, and then:

MRS. MCLENNAN (0.S.)
Who is this?

Stephanie glances at the application from the camp.
STEPHANIE

Hi there! My name is Maryanne Chelkowsky,
I'm the director of Squaw Lake Bible camp-
132

133

83.

MRS. MCLENNAN (0.S.)
What do you want?

STEPHANIE
Well, we are planning the fiftieth
anniversary reunion edition of our Camp
Gazette ... and I’m trying to track down
some of our star alumni! Do you happen to
be of any relation to Hope and Fait
McLennan?

A second phone picks up and another voice comes on, BRUCE
(60s), THE CARETAKER:

BRUCE (0.S.)
Hello?

MRS. MCLENNAN (0.S.)
Bruce? It’s that camp. The girls must
have done something again. God have mercy
on me if those girls need to come home
early again.

BRUCE (0.S.)
The girls are long gone, Mrs. M. You just
go on back to your chair.

MRS. MCLENNAN (0.S.)
It’s filthy in there, Bruce. I’ve asked
you a thousand times --

BRUCE (0.S.)
(short)
I'll be right in, Mrs. M.

There’s the sound of the phone dropping again. Stephanie
hears Bruce breathing into the phone. She ventures ahead ...

STEPHANIE
Yes, Bruce, I was just speaking to Mrs.
McLennan about our 50th reunion--

Click. The line goes dead. Stephanie knows she hit paydirt.
EXT. MCLENNAN MANOR - DAY 132

Stephanie has pulled onto the shoulder of the road, staking
out a SPRAWLING MANSION, a near-ruin of dingy columns and
colonnades. Vines have grown over a monogrammed gate. The
lineage of some great industrialist family has ended with a
whimper here.

As she moves along a gate, she sees - the WEST WING OF THE
MANSION has been completely BURNED DOWN. It’s charred rubble
has been jpartitioned off with plywood and tarps, blowing like
ghost sails in the wind.

Stephanie stops at the MAILBOX where she pulls out the day’s
mai She races back to her car as the rain turns to hail.

INT. STEPHANIE'S VOLVO - MOMENTS LATER 133

She sorts through the mail: Bills for BRUCE HARGRAVE. A
massive CATALOG for Margaret Mclennan: “OLD MONEY STYLE:
VANDERBILT ON A VAN-DE-KAMP’S BUDGET.”
84.

Stephanie perks up as she sees BRUCE (60s), walking out of
the house in coveralls with a hunting shotgun over his
shoulder. He’s an old caretaker with a ghoulish quality. He
hops into his old truck and takes off down the driveway.

STEPHANIE
Take your time, Bruce.

Here’s Stephanie’s chance. Deftly, she ties a handkerchief
over her head like a 50s HOUSEKEEPER, grabs freshly purchased
cleaning equipment (mop, bucket, feather duster) out of a
Target bag, and rushes out into "the storm.

134 EXT. MCLENNAN MANSION - MOMENTS LATER 134

Stephanie rings the bell. We can tell she’s been at the door
for a while. She rings the doorbell again, which echoes in a
vast chasm inside. She bangs a last time.

Then, like the lid of a coffin, the door creeps open anda
FRAIL HAND appears in the crease. An old woman’s eyes peer
out at Stephanie in the slanting rain.

STEPHANIE
Mrs. McLennan? Hello! I’m Gloria. I’m
from the cleaning service.

Mrs. McLennan stares back with bewildered eyes.

MRS. MCLENNAN
Who?

STEPHANIE
Oh, goodness. Did Bruce not tell you? He
Said I was supposed _to clean the entire
house until you could eat a four-course
meal off the floors. Did I get the date
wrong?

The old woman makes a hard, irritable face. She closes the
door. Dammit. But then it opens again, unlatched and pulled
wide for her.

MRS. MCLENNAN
Start in the downstairs bathroom.

135 INT. MCLENNAN MANOR - BATHROOM - DAY 135

 

Her plan has backfired as Stephanie, in rubber gloves, cleans
an extremely dirty toilet. Exasperated, she looks up at a
giant JESUS portrait over the toilet. She eyes him, guilty.

STEPHANIE
(to the portrait)
Well, it’s not_lying if I’m really
cleaning the place.

136 INT. MCLENNAN MANOR - CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON 136

 

As Stephanie wanders with her bucket, lightning flashes in
the gauzy curtains. She looks at old’ pictures of SCOWLING
INDUSTRIALISTS on the wall. She finally stops at one picture -

- HOPE AND FAITH. They stare ahead with hard faces, arm-in-
arm, as if unified against the photographer.
85.

MRS. MCLENNAN (0.S.)
Bruce! The fire’s dying. Bruce!

Stephanie takes off her head wrap and hustles ahead.
137 INT. MCLENNAN MANOR - SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 137

As Stephanie feeds wood onto the fire, Mrs. McLennan is now
seated on her red velvet chair, thumbing through an “OLD
MONEY STYLE CATALOG.” Stephanie sees a massive FORMAL
PORTRAIT of a younger Mrs. McLennan in an evening gown above
the grand piano.

STEPHANIE
I couldn't help but notice that lovely
picture of your daughters.

MRS. MCLENNAN
What have they done now?

STEPHANIE
Nothing, no. I was just commenting on how
beautiful they are. You must be a very
proud mother.

Mrs. McLeannan clears her throat and leans forward. She seems
to have lost track of who Stephanie is without the head wrap.

MRS. MCLENNAN
I don’t know what sort of donation you're
looking for, but the well has gone dry.

STEPHANIE
Oh, I’m not looking for any money.

MRS. MCLENNAN
Well, you must be the only one. My
husband lost a fortune in the recall of
798. I warned him, you know. It was a
defect with the airbags. Do you know
anything about airbags, Miss?

STEPHANIE
I’m afraid not.

MRS. MCLENNAN .
What good are you then? Where is Bruce?

STEPHANIE
Bruce has gone out for a while. So your
daughter Faith ...? She had some

troubles, I take it.

MRS. MCLENNAN
She restored my faith, all right. In the
devil.

STEPHANIE
That's a very strong statement coming
from a mother.

MRS. MCLENNAN
Are you a mother?
86.

STEPHANIE
I am. I love every minute of it.

MRS. MCLENNAN
Well, you must have brain damage. It’s a
thankless business. And some children are
born rotten. They don’t need a parent,
they need an exorcist. My husband
understood that.

The old woman rises ... and heads to a HUGE BOOKSHELF. She
pulls out a dictionary to reveal a HIDDEN BOTTLE.

MRS. MCLENNAN (CONT’D
Don’t tell Bruce about this. It’s
unseemly the way that man polices me.
Would you like some sherry?

STEPHANIE
No, thank you. Sweet of you to offer.

MRS. MCLENNAN
(opens bottle; smells it)
Oh, that’s not the sherry. It’s the gin.
The sherry must be behind another book.

She looks up at the massive bookcase, hundreds of tomes. It’d
take her a month to look behind all of them. Then she shrugs
and returns to the chair with her straight gin.

STEPHANIE
So what ever happened to Faith?

MRS. MCLENNAN
The family shame. We paid so much money
for that girl and her rehabilitation. Is
there any service where one pays so
dearly to get so little?

STEPHANIE
She was using drugs?

MRS. MCLENNAN
drinking)
Oh please do pay attention. Hope tried to
take care of her, to get her off that
stuff, I know - but of course Hope is a
born liar. With terrible posture.

An idea comes over Stephanie. She unfolds the FAX from her
Rocket ,with “GOTTA HAVE FAITH” written across the bottom.
he military coat, the sunken cheeks.

STEPHANIE
Mrs. McLennan. Do you recognize anyone in
this picture?

Stephanie thrusts the picture in front of the old woman’s
eyes. Suddenly, some recognition seems to come into her
oblivious features. She looks back at Stephanie with a new
expression of fear.

MRS. MCLENNAN
Faith. What does she want now? Who are
you? Did she send you?
87.

STEPHANIE MRS. MCLENNAN (CONT'D)
No, ma‘am. I’m not even sure-- Are you the police?

STEPHANIE
No, no, I’m just asking -

MRS. MCLENNAN
I've told you all a thousand times, my
memory isn’t very good anymore. It won’t
stand up in court. The night of the fire,
my husband and I were estranged. We were
in separate wings of the house. I was in
the east wing.

STEPHANIE
A fire burned down the west wing?

MRS. MCLENNAN
Lord, you’re so dense. May, 2001. I’m
exceptional with dates. Unless it’s
today’s. Is it Wednesday? Are you an
insurance agent?

Stephanie swallows with guilt. It hurts to lie to this old
woman in her state, but —

STEPHANIE
Yes.

MRS. MCLENNAN
(softening again)
Oh good. Bruce and I have been waiting
for the insurance money. My husband's
stamp collection alone was worth a
fortune. But you’ve got that ridiculous
clause about arson. Vultures.

She toasts her bottle of gin.

MRS. MCLENNAN (CONT’D)
Here's to being “house poor.”

The phrase strikes Stephanie as familiar - but just then,
with a loud squeak, the FRONT DOOR swings open down the hall.
Stephanie stiffens at the sound - and Mrs. McLennan panics,
too, handing her the bottle of gin.

MRS. MCLENNAN (CONT’D)
It’s Bruce. Hide this.

With booming heavy footsteps, Bruce comes down the hall.
Stephanie pulls aside books to hide the bottle, but finds a
different bottle behind each.

Finally she drops it into her bucket beside the toilet brush.
She can think of nothing else but to grab the huge “OLD MONEY
STYLE” CATALOG from the end table beside Mrs. McLennan as
BRUCE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY, HOLDING HIS SHOTGUN IN ONE HAD
AND A DEAD GOOSE BY THE NECK IN THE OTHER.

Stephanie tries not to freak. She waves the magazine in the
air as she squeezes past a glaring Bruce in the doorway.
88.

STEPHANIE
Thank you very much for your time, Mrs.
McLennan. We'll process your order for
the faux Chanel suit in ivory and the
taupe scarf ... we’ll put a rush on it.

She bolts to the front door, hurriedly unlatching lock until -
138 EXT. MCLENNAN MANOR - AFTERNOON 138
- she’s outside, dashing back to her car.
139 INT. STEPHANIE’S VOLVO - AFTERNOON 139

Hands shaking, Stephanie starts the car and drives quickly
down the driveway, looking back in her rearview mirror for
Bruce. She looks forward and GASPS, slamming on the brakes.

BRUCE STANDS IN FRONT OF HER CAR, SHOTGUN ON HIP, THE
DRIVEWAY GATES CLOSED BEHIND HIM. Looking like an ax
murderer, BRUCE stands in her headlights. He slowly starts to
walk forward.

Stephanie is hyperventilating as he comes to her window. Her
eyes are wide. Should she try to ram the gate? It’s too
heavy. Bruce taps on the window with the barrel of his
shotgun. Sweating, she rolls it down, her face pale.

BRUCE
Where do you think you’re going?
(a beat)
I wanted to order the Navy blazer. Extra

large.

Exhale. She nods yes as he goes and opens the driveway gates.
140 INT. LOCAL LIBRARY - DAY 140
Stephanie approaches the LIBRARIAN'S DESK.
STEPHANIE

Hi. I’m looking for all arson-related

news items from Wayne County in 2001.
AT A MICROFICHE CARREL
Stephanie scans an article in a local newspaper dated May 3,
200 The headline reads: “Teen Twins Vanish After Deadly

House Fire”

STEPHANIE
Holy smokes.

Stephanie scrolls the article, collecting phrases like

“trapped in the house”... “suspicion of arson”... “possible
abduction”...
141 ON VIDEO VLOG - INT. MICHIGAN MOTEL - DAY 141

 

Stephanie addresses the camera from her motel room.
89.

STEPHANIE
Hi, Moms. Stephanie here. I’m coming to
you today from Michigan for a special on-
the-road edition. As you all know, I've
been struggling to find closure around
the tragic death of my best friend. So I
drove to the lake where she drowned, just
seeing if I could dredge up a little
something.

142 INT. WARFIELD INN - EMILY’S MOTEL ROOM - DAY 142
Emily watches the VIDEO vlog of Stephanie, slack-jawed.

EMILY
You crazy bitch.

STEPHANIE (ON COMPUTER)
At first, I just couldn't figure why
anyone would drive to Michigan just to
shoot heroin and jump in a lake.
(a smile)
I could only” figure that this particular
watering hole had sentimental value.

EMILY
No, no, no, no, no...

STEPHANIE (ON, COMPUTER)
Turns out, it was the site of many a
canoe racé for Camp Squaw Lake, a Bible
Camp that only a_saint could love. I had
to dig throu plenty of camp journals:
they had no ining system. But I finally
found a picture of Emily. Or Claudia.

She holds up the SQUAW LAKE BIBLE CAMP GAZETTE PICTURE.

EMILY
Motherfucker.

STEPHANIE (ON COMPUTER)
It’s like looking at an angel, isn’t it,
moms? And it gave me the closure I
needed. It made me feel closer to her
than I’ve ever felt. Almost like a
sister. So, wherever you are, Emily ... I
really HOPE you’re listening ... you’ve
gotta have Faith.

EMILY
Mother. Fucker.

143 INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAY 143
Stephanie unlocks the door and enters.

STEPHANIE
Mom’s home!

Miles flies at her and hugs her as Nicky rounds the corner.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Oh, Smooch. I missed you.
90.

Miles glances over at the table, suddenly looking caught and
guilty. There’s a glass of milk without a coaster under it.

MILES
Sorry, mom. I forgot.

STEPHANIE
You know what? Forget Mr. Coaster. Mr.
Glass can stand wherever he wants.

MILES
(looks at her oddly)
Are you okay, mom?

STEPHANIE ;
I’ve never been better, sweetie.

NICKY
Where were you? Why did we have to sleep
at Hector’s? He pees the bed.
Sean emerges from the kitchen with a whiskey in hand.

SEAN
They could've stayed with me, you know.

The sight of him unnerves her. She quickly regroups.
STEPHANIE
I thought we all needed a breather. I
know I feel like a million bucks.
Stephanie heads up the stairs.
STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
(under her breath)
Maybe even four million.
Sean studies her, suspicious now.

144 INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT 144

Stephanie emerges from the bathroom in a nightgown carrying
her clothes. Séan watches her from the bed.

SEAN
Since when do you undress in the
bathroom?

Stephanie shrugs and shoves her clothes in the hamper.

SEAN (CONT'D)
I didn’t like the way we left things.

Sean moves up behind her at the mirror as she brushes her
hair. His hands slide up her body, cupping her breasts. She
moves away. He tries to joke, but he’s frustrated.

SEAN (CONT'D)
Cold hands? Bad breath? What’s wrong?

STEPHANIE
I’m just tired. It was a long drive and
the Stuckey’s isn’t sitting well.
145

91.

Stephanie climbs into bed and turns on her side, her back to
Sean. He eyes her, writhing inside. She’s wrapping him around
her finger now.

SEAN
I’m tired of women lying to me.

STEPHANIE
I know just what you mean. Good night.

She reaches over and turns off the lamp beside her bed.
INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY 145

stephanie sits at Sean’s desktop computer and clicks on the
hard drive. Everything is neatly organized.

STEPHANIE
Follow the money ...

She finds the folder labeled FAMILY FINANCE and opens it.
Sees INSURANCE EMILY-2 and clicks on the PDF. It opens up a
standard confirmation letter from Allied Insurance. She
scrolls to the bottom for the customer service number. Dials.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Hi, my name is Beth. I’m calling on
behalf of my boss Sean Townsend regarding
his wife Emily Nelson's policy.

(gading account nu
CT7602258. Do you know the name of the
agent who handles that account?

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 146

Stephanie opens a fake e-mail account under the name
bhargrave@gmail.com, then drafts an e-mail to
iprager@alliedinsurance.com.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
“Dear Mr. Prager .-.. My name is Bruce
Hargrave. I’m writing to you about a case
you’re handling for Emily Nelson,
recently deceased. I have been the
caretaker of her family estate for many
years. What I have to say will sound
crazy, but years ago, m aan loyer died in
a house fire. His teen aug) ters, Hope
and Faith, disappeared without a_ trace.
I’m attaching an old photo as well as
some articles about the fire. I have
reason_to believe one of the girls died
recently under the name Emily Nelson.
Before you shell out that money, you
should know that she had a TWIN SISTER.
And while it may sound extreme to think a
gizi could kill her twin to stage her own
leath, I’m sure you run into a myriad of
strange situations in your line of work.
(thinks )
While I want to see justice served, I
prefer to be left out of this. Please
consider this an anonymous tip. Best
wishes, Bruce Hargrave.

CLICK. Stephanie lets out a long slow exhale.

INT. DOLCE VITA RESTAURANT - GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY 147

 

A trendy Italian restaurant. Sean sits alone in a corner
booth, annoyed. He huffs and dials his cell phone.

SEAN (ON PHONE
Hi, this is Sean Townsen I was supposed
to meet Billy Kent for lunch?
(his face drops)
What do you mean? You called two days ago
to set it up.

A shadow falls over Sean. He looks up and sees -- Emily
standing over him in a baseball cap and shades.

SEAN (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
Nevermind. No, don’t call him.

He hangs up. Emily slides into the booth.

EMILY
We spent every anniversary here, you
dumbshit. How could you not put it
together? You’ve got “Mommy brain” now?

SEAN
(in shock, then)
Why, Emily? why?

She takes a breadstick from beside him and crunches on it.

EMILY
I have four million reasons.

SEAN
How could you do this to Nicky?

EMILY

I did this for Nicky. I hated that job: I
never got to See him. And you clearly
only had one book in you. We couldn’t
exactly live off the faculty buffet the
rest of our lives. I was going to buy us
our freedom and . it would have worked
perfectly ... ae con just hadn’t shacked
up with Miss Zuce ini fucking Cookie.

Sean has to look down into his plate. He’s dizzy.

SEAN
Whom did I bury?

EMILY .
Let’s not split hairs over the details.

SEAN
I was grieving your death.

EMILY
That’s how you grieve? Balls deep in my
“best friend?” That’s some renegade
therapy.
93.

SEAN
She's been good to Nicky. At a time when
he really needed it.

Emily seethes at this comment. It disrupts her usual aplomb.

EMILY
Oh, she’s been good to Nicky? That’s what
drew you to her, her extraordinary
mothering. You're all just little horny
boys, aren’t you?

SEAN
You could have told me something. Anything.

EMILY
Except pon can’t keep a secret. Even in
the dar you almost ruined everything.
I was just gonna lay low until the
insurance money came through.

SEAN
So why didn’t you? Instead you’ve been
terrorizing your son, making me think he
and Stephanie had gone mad. Why didn’t
you stick to your plan?

Emily's face wilts, showing sincere longing.

EMILY

I missed Nicky. He’s my little man.

(reclaiming her iciness)
Anyway, the clock is ticking. Nancy Drew
knows too much and if she fucks up that
insurance money y then I’m taking you down
with me. Don’t forget, Sean, this was all
your plan.

SEAN
My plan? I--

Sean hears a CLICK. Emily raises her hand enough to show she
has a GUN, pointed at his groin under the table.

EMILY
Do you love her?

He sees the madness in her eyes. He says the only thing he
can to maintain the peace:

SEAN
No. It was just sex.

EMILY
Did you think of me while you were
fucking her?

SEAN
Yes.

EMILY
Do you love me or not, Sean?
148

94,

SEAN
(in pain; straining)
Of course I love you. Stephanie means
nothing to me.

Emily sees the WAITRESS heading over to them. CLICK! Emily
fires the gun at his groin, causing him to jolt and go rigid.
She smiles devilishly: the chamber was empty.

EMILY
That’s just an appetizer, baby.

She rises, coolly slipping the gun back in her purse, then
bends down and kisses

EMILY (CONT'D)
Meet me in the bathroom in twenty seconds
for the main course. Knock twice.

She heads off. Sean can’t believe what just happened. He
stares down the long dark hallway to the LADIES ROOM door,
his chest rising in panic.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 148
A preoccupied Sean enters the house, looking shell-shocked.

STEPHANIE (0.S.)
Here he is now.

Sean looks up to see Stephanie sitting on the couch with
ISAAC PRAGER (40s), a goughy » pedantic CLAIMS ADJUSTER. He
stands and holds dae his hand.

PRAGER
Mr. Townsend. Isaac Prager, Allied
Insurance. I’m investigating the death
benefit claim for your late wife.

STEPHANIE
Sean, did you know that Emily had a twin
sister?

Sean stops, eyes wide, putting it all together. Then ...

SEAN
No. But then ...

STEPHANIE
The woman in the lake was her sister.

PRAGER
It would explain the DNA match.

STEPHANIE
So, where’s Emily?

SEAN
(composing himself)
If my wife were alive, she’d come home.
She’ "a want to see her son.

PRAGER
I’m not a cop. And I’m definitely no
therapist. I’m just an insurance guy. But
this is definitely an interesting case.

STEPHANIE
Will you need to exhume the body?

Sean shoots her a look, shocked by her macabre question.

PRAGER
No, ma’am. Allied Insurance considers
digging up graves to be bad PR. We have a
thorough autopsy. But everyone tends to
read it in different ways.

STEPHANIE
I see. Like the missing front tooth.

Sean is boiling inside as he looks at Stephanie.

PRAGER
I’m not sure I caught that. A missing
front tooth?

Stephanie watches Sean like a hawk as he squirms.

PRAGER (CONT'D)
I will say, it’s unusual to live with
someone as husband-and-wife and not know
they have a twin.

STEPHANIE
Or a missing tooth.

SEAN
She was a very private person.

PRAGER
Well, hey, we all have secrets. But as
I’m Sure you can understand with a
payment of this size, we're going to have
to continue this claims investigation.

SEAN
Of course.
PRAGER
And, by law, we’ll have to notify the

authorities of our findings.

SEAN
I just hope she’s alive. I want her back.

Stephanie tightens, pained by his words. Prager shakes his

han rises, and they all head to the front door ...

SEAN
You knew and you didn’t tell me.

She heads back to the kitchen. He watches her go, reeling.

STEPHANIE (PRE-LAP
Hi, Moms. Stephanie here. Today we're
talking about Tombstone Tributes. I want
to thank Helen from Missoula, Montana,
for thinking out of the box.

EXT. WARFIELD CEMETERY - DAY 150

Blue skies, green grass and headstones as far as the eye can
see. Stephanie stands at Emily’s geave site. Opens a small
cooler and takes out a silver” shaker and two frozen glasses.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
It doesn’t have to be flowers anymore. A
favorite household item can do the trick.
And Emily’s favorite treat was a dry gin
martini in the early afternoon.

She puts the martini glasses on Emily’s headstone. Stephanie
ours each glass to the rim. Peels two large twists from a
emon, squeezes one over each glass and rubs them around each

rim, then drops one in each glass.

STEPHANIE (V.O.
I’m gonna make them exactly like Emily
did. Frozen gin into frozen glasses and a
generous twist. Her beloved Dukes. And
'm going to have a toast on her grave.

A FIGURE approaches behind Stephanie. It’s Emily in her wig
and glasses. Stephanie can hear her approach but doesn’t
turn. Emily stands alongside her, studying the headstone.

EMILY
Sean must have picked the font on the
headstone. He loves Helvetica.

STEPHANIE
Men are so simple.

Emily reaches for the martini glass.

EMILY
Nice big twist. I taught you well.

STEPHANIE
The student becomes the master.

Emily winces at the cliche, but clinks with Stephanie.

EMILY
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

Emily goes to take a drink, then pauses. She switches glasses
- and indicates that Stephanie should drink first.

EMILY (CONT'D)
I never know what surprises you have up
these new empowered sleeves of yours,
Dark Side. Let’s hope you haven’t build
up a tolerance to something.

STEPHANIE
You think I poisoned both drinks? That’s
not t style.

I don" t even eat gluten.

Emily throws back her martini, facing Stephanie for a duel.

EMILY
You want another?

STEPHANIE
Bring it on. But first tell my why you
killed your father and sister.

EMILY
Oh, are we airing dirty laundry? Like
your son’s real father?

STEPHANIE
Try me. I hold the cards, Emily. I want
to know about “Faith.”

Emily looks at Stephanie, who stares her down defiantly.

EMILY
We were triplets. Faith, Hope, and
Charity. But Charity was stillborn. M
mother used to say that Faith and I offed
her in the womb. And dad believed her.

STEPHANIE
Quite a mother. I had a nice afternoon
with Mags. She likes her martinis even
stronger than yours.

EMILY
You met my mother?

STEPHANIE
We had_a little walk down memory lane.
Actually it was more of a blind alley.
But I got the picture. She was a cold
woman, Em. I doubt you could ever do
anything right in her eyes.

Thrown for a loop, Emily looks childlike and exposed.

Was it Faith’s idea to set that fire?

can you tell?

EXT. LAKE’S EDGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 153
A bonfire burns in the middle of a field. Teens hang out and
drink, dance, make out. Faith makes out with a CUTE BOY. Hope
watches them’ kiss with a mix of envy and_concern ... until
she sees her FATHER’S CAR rolling downhill toward them.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
And if your mother always had the biting

comment ...
INT. MCLENNAN MANOR - NIGHT 154

Hope is locked inside a dark closet as she HEARS the sound of
Faith being punished by her father on the other side of the
door. Faith SCREAMS and fights back as Hope holds her ears.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
+. I bet your father was more direct.

EXT. MCLENNAN MANOR - NIGHT 155

Hope and Faith each have a gas can in hand as they watch the
bedroom wing of the mansion burn from the front lawn.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
I know that’s when you learned to hit the
reset button. Burn, baby, burn.

EXT. WARFIELD CEMETERY - RESUME SCENE 156
This time Emily is seduced by Stephanie. There’s warmth and
forgiveness in Stephanie’s voice, which prompts Emily to lean
against her own headstone, pouring herself a second martini.

STEPHANIE
When did you and Faith part ways?

EMILY
We couldn’t stay together after the fire.
INT. GREYHOUND BUS (MOVING) - DAY 157

Hope and Faith ride the bus. Hope looks out the window, her
mind spipning: planning for them. A WELL-MEANING TOURIST taps
them, holding up a camera, wanting a picture of the pretty
twins. Faith violently slaps the camera out of the woman’s
hands, hissing at her to fuck off.

EMILY (V.O.)
We were a freakshow wherever we went.

INT. HOUSTON TATTOO PARLOR - DAY 158

Ho) Hope and Faith sit across from each other, gripping each

Faith's matching barbed wire tattoo.

EMILY (V.O.)
We said goodbye with tattoos ...

EXT. CORPUS CHRISTI STREET - DAY 159

STEPHANIE

But you never showed up.
Emily shakes her head. She sips the martini.

EMILY
I bought a one-way ticket to New York
City and I never looked back.

; _ STEPHANIE
Did you miss her?

EMILY
For a while. But you get used to pain.
You use it. Besides, Faith would only get
me in trouble again. She always did.
Sometimes I_ think my mother was right
about her. But then my life in New York
fell_into place perfectly. People took me
in. I got a job, worked my way up, met
the perfect man. That part you know.

She shoots Stephanie a deadly look.

; STEPHANIE
Until your sister showed up.

EMILY
Damn Facebook. I could kill that Mark
Zuckerberg. Sure, it’s all baby pictures
and protest marches until I got fingered.

STEPHANIE
You wouldn't meet her in New York: you
had too much to lose. So you fabricated a
trip to Miami, and went back to meet her
at your old camp.

EMILY
Bunk Six. Our happy place.

EXT. SQUAW LAKE BIBLE CAMP - DAY (FLASHBACK) 161

 

Emily heads down the dirt path to GIRLS BUNK SIX. She braces
herself then opens the door to ...

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
It must have been a shock. Seeing her
again after all those years.

INT. SQUAW LAKE BIBLE CAMP - BUNK SIX - DAY (FLASHBACK) 162

 

Faith is already inside, wearing the ARMY JACKET from the
fax. She rises to face her sister. Identical twins, the
contrast between them is shocking. Faith is a full-blown
junkie. Dirty and haggard, dark rings around her eyes. Her
ront tooth is broken.

EMILY (V.O.)
It was like looking in the mirror ... and
seeing the life I could have had. The
life I fought not to have.

Faith moves toward Emily and hugs her. Behind her shoulder,
Emily gags at the smell of her sister and chokes back tears.

STEPHANIE (V.O.)
And did she forgive you?

Behind Emily’s shoulder, we PUSH IN ON FAITH’S FACE as her
smile dissipates and hardens into a deep-seated rage.

EMILY (V.0O.)
No.

EXT. WARFIELD CEMETERY - RESUME SCENE - DAY 163

Emily stands in silence. Stephanie has got her now, like a
perfect den motherly prosecutor, slowly reeling her in.

STEPHANIE
And how did you get your sister out into
the lake?

EMILY
Fuck you. That was her idea. I didn’t
kill my sister.
164

101.

INT. BUNK SIX - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK) 164

 

Emily watches with dread and fascination as Faith drops a
syringe. Her arm goes limp and her eyes become gassy.
Faith’s head tips back as the warm rush climbs her body. She
smiles at Emily, revealing her broken front tooth.

FAITH
You gotta have Faith. And now here I am.

Faith laughs darkly, her smile hardening to malice.

EMILY
What are you up to, Faith?

FAITH
You abandoned me. And now I’m going to
the cops. To tell them everything we did.
And when I go under, you go with me.

EMILY
I have a family now.

FAITH
Awwww, that kid is so cute. So’s the
husband. Can I be you for a day? Like in
High School when we’d switch places?

EMILY
What do you want from me?
FAITH
I want a million dollars in cash.
EMILY
Where the hell would I get that?
FAITH
You're rich and famous. You'll figure it

out.
Emily glowers at her. Then she appears to make a decision.
EMILY
Maybe I owe you this much for abandoning
you. Okay. I’11l sell the house.

Emily softens, fighting tears. This may well be an act, but
if so, it’s a damn good one ...

FAITH
Uch, it’s fucking hot in here. Let’s go
swimming. Like old times.

Faith tugs her wool dress over her head, no underwear. Emily
watches, disturbed.

FAITH (CONT'D)
You coming?

Emily considers it. Her mind working quickly.

EMILY
I’m right behind you.
102.

EXT. WITCH LAKE - WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON 165

 

Emily makes her way through the woods to follow Faith, whose
bare flesh flashes through the trees.

EXT. WITCH LAKE - LAKE FRONT - LATE AFTERNOON 166

Faith wades into the water then submerges under its icy
surface. Emily peels off her dress down to her bra and
underwear. She wades into the water with a gasp, her jaw
clenched against the cold. Faith surfaces and treads water.

FAITH
C'mon, wimp! I thought you were the
Alpha!

EMILY
(muttering)
I am the Alpha, goddammit.

Emily dives into the water, then swims out_to where Faith is.
They tread water, face to face in the moonlight. Faith’s
expression shifts. She’s childlike, vulnerable.

FAITH
How could you leave me like that? We were
supposed to be a team. You and me.
Forever.

EMILY
I know. I’m sorry. We were.

Emily takes her sister's shoulders to hug her ...

; EMILY (CONT'D)
It’s just ... things have changed.

She shoves Faith under the water. Faith struggles and
splashes to the surface, but Emily shoves her down again. The
struggle persists. Emily is athletic and strong. Her will to
murder is stronger than Faith’s will to live.

Finally the struggle stops. Faith goes limp and floats. Emily
holds her sister in her arms. A tender moment. Emily glances
at her own hand, the sapphire and diamond engagement RING.

She pulls the ring off her finger and wrestles it onto
Faith’s lifeless finger, forcing it on.

EXT. WARFIELD CEMETERY - DAY 167
A few real tears roll down Emily's cheeks.

EMILY
I woke up the next morning and she wasn’t
there. I couldn’t find her anywhere.
Finally I remembered how much she loved
swimming in the lake. So I went there. I
was too late ...

Now Stephanie reads Emily the same way Emily once read her.
103.

STEPHANIE
You’re lying. You drowned her. You're a
sister killer.

EMILY
Well, you’re a brother fucker.

STEPHANIE
What does Sean know?

EMILY
Everything.

Stephanie is stung by this. Emily sees her chance.

EMILY, (CONT'D)

He told me to disappear until the money

came through. Said we could finally get

out of debt, sell the house, leave the

gountry. start over, that I could quit my
s

job an pend more time with Nicky.
STEPHANIE .
I don’t believe you. Sean grieved for
you.
EMILY
All an act.
STEPHANIE

You're a pathological liar.

EMILY
Did Sean say that?

Emily takes out her cell phone, plays an AUDIO CLIP.

EMILY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Do you love her?

SEAN (0.S.)
No. It was just sex.

EMILY (0.S.)
Did you think of me while you were
fucking her?

SEAN (0.S.)
Yes.

EMILY (0.S.)
Do you love me or not, Sean?

SEAN (0.S.)
Of course, I love you. Stephanie means
nothing to me.

The CLIP stops. Stephanie looks sick to her stomach.

EMILY
Sorry, Steph. I know you thought it was
real. But let’s look on the bright side.
Your web site went viral thanks to me.
Now you can sell those ad banners.
104.

STEPHANIE
All of this was for a little money.

EMILY
Yeah, a little four million. Sean
convinced me we could pull it off. M
sister didn’t exist anymore. DNA would
take care of the rest. All I had to do
was_ lay low for six months so he could
collect the money, sell the house, tie up
loose ends.

STEPHANIE
Was I a loose end?

EMILY
Sean needed some help looking after
Nick And you're so good with them.
Dart. “Mommy.

The entire tone has changed. It’s like a chess match and
Emily seems to have regained an advantage.

STEPHANIE
You were supposed to lay low. Why did you
come back at all?

Emily glares back at her, offended now.

EMILY
Look, I may be a working mother ... but
that doesn’t make me any less a mom.
(grimacing)

Every time you yiosged about how much
Nick cried or how he hated quinoa,
couldn’t take it. It was like a hostage
standoff. I had to see him again. To fet
him know that I was coming back. He’s my
heart and soul, Stephanie, my everything.
It doesn’t matter how good your brownies
are, he’s my son.

This has an effect on Stephanie and she blinks away tears.

STEPHANIE
So what happens now?

EMILY
I want my son. Period. You fucked up the
insurance mone) and_the authorities
won't stop loo: ing. I don’t even give a
shit anymore: take Sean.

STEPHANIE
I don’t want Sean. Not after this.

A flicker of satisfaction on Emily’s face. They wait quietly.
Then Emily breaks the silence.

EMILY
Then there’s one other option, one mom to
another.

Emily reaches out her glass to toast. Stephanie clinks her
glass into her friend’s. OFF STEPHANIE, curious --

STEPHANIE

kiss chills him to the bone. She’s hurt: he’s no longer
entirely under her spell.

EMILY (CONT'D)

Stephanie, please. You won’t even let the
boys play with squirt guns.

STEPHANIE
(cocking the gun)
Well, there’s a time and a place for

everything.
EMILY

Whoa, Stephanie ... take it down a notch.
STEPHANIE

You used me, Sean. And for what? Free
babysitting? Home-cooked meals? I had to
wash those bicycle shorts.

EMILY
Oh, I hate those.
SEAN
I swear, I had no idea she was alive --
STEPHANIE
No more lying!
EMILY
I agree. Let’s just sit down and talk

this out.

SEAN
You sit, Em. You hated Stephanie. You
called her Captain Mom. You used to watch
her vlog and tear her apart.

STEPHANIE
(hurt, to Emily)
All_I ever wanted was to be your friend,
Emily.

Emily stares back with sincere eyes.

EMILY
You were. I didn’t expect it ... but I
loved you. Then you fucked my husband and
all of” my best plans.

SEAN
Don’t blame her -

EMILY
We could have been rich, Sean.

SEAN
Maybe if you'd had the good _ sense to call
- I could have helped your little plot!
112.

EMILY
Oh, you haven’t come up with a decent
plot in ten years.

STEPHANIE
I’m going to say something. Objectively.
Nicky deserves better than both of you.

SEAN
Stephanie, put the gun down. You don’t
want to do this.

Stephanie fingers the trigger as tears roll down her cheeks.

_ EMILY
Stephanie.

STEPHANIE
I loved you, Sean. And I loved you,
Emily. This is the only way.

SEAN
But, Stephanie, I love y---

BANG! Stephanie shoots Sean in the chest, blowing a bloody
hole in his shirt. Sean clutches his chest and staggers
backwards, knees buckling.

STEPHANIE
Oh God! Oh no!

Stephanie wails and rushes to Sean, draping over him.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Don't die! Sean. Please, don’t die. I
didn’t mean to do that. I’m so sorry -

SEAN
(sputtering)
No, I’m sorry.

STEPHANIE
No, God, please. I got so caught up. But
I love you, Sean. Don’t die.
Emily sips her martini, suddenly completely calm.
EMILY ;
Oh yes, God, Sean. Please don’t die.
(a long beat)
Okay, cut the waterworks.
Stephanie looks up at her, confused. Emily draws a gun.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Get up.

Stephanie slowly rises to her feet.

EMILY (CONT'D)
You too, DiCaprio.

Sean lies limp, eyes closed. Dead. Emily kicks him in the
gut. Sean clenches and groans.
113.

EMILY (CONT'D)
Get up! Show’s over.

Sean gets up and stands with Stephanie. They both know
they're screwed. Emily grins.

EMILY (CONT’D)
That was almost brilliant, Stephanie.
Almost. So, the cops planted a mic
somewhere in here. You shoot him with a
blank. Fake blood. Nice cinematic touch.
I confess everything. You really almost
had me. I knew there was so much more to
you, Stephanie. You’ve got real panache.

Spattered with fake blood all over her blouse, Stephanie
looks genuinely touched. Another misplaced moment of bonding.

STEPHANIE
Thank you. You know that really means a
lot to me.

Emily nods back.
STEPHANIE (CONT'D)

But you already did confess, Em. And the
police are on their way.

EMILY
No, no, no, don’t try that. You had me
just a little buzzed from this ... but

you're still a standard martini,
Stephanie. You’re not the standard-bearer
from Dukes.

Stephanie stares back, confused. Suddenly, Emily does a
perfect imitation of Stephanie’ Ss voice.

EMILY (CONT'D)
(as Stephanie)

“HL Cops, Stephanie here! Change of

plans. I’m meeting Emily and Sean at

Darren’s house now. Hurry!”

STEPHANIE
You sent the cops to Darren’s house?

186 INT. DARREN’S HOUSE - AT THAT SAME MOMENT 186

 

Darren, Sona and Stacy are having a “Moms Night” at Darren’s
house. They're playing Pictionary and smoking pot as
Stephanie’s OLD VLOGS play in the background. Sona is taking
a long drag as she draws something indecipherable.

DARREN
It’s a virus ... it’s a... it’s String
Theory. Is it String theory?

BLAM!!! The front door is splintered by a battering ram as a
SWAT TEAM storm in, guns drawn. The moms SCREAM.

SWAT LEADER
Hands up, weapons down! NOW!!!
114.

DARREN
(hands up, wailing)
I have a prescription! It’s for my sleep
apnea!

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - BACK TO SCENE 187

Emily holds up a gun in one hand and, in the other -- THE BUG
the cops planted. The small mic cord’ has been severed.

EMILY
I’ve lived on the run for over a decade:
you don’t think I know how to manipulate
the authorities?

SEAN
So you're going to kill us?

EMILY
A murder-suicide seems like the only
fitting end for you two. And I believe
our insurance will still pay for that.
One door closes, another door opens.

SEAN
You have always been fucking crazy.

BANG! Emily shoots Sean in the shoulder. He falls to his
nees.

SEAN (CONT'D)
Agh!! You really shot me!

EMILY
I’m crazy. You said so yourself.

Emily aims the gun at Stephanie, who stares her down.

STEPHANIE |
You won’t kill me, Emily.

EMILY
(cocking the gan)
The hell I won’t. 1 have to add this
to my list. A father, a sister ... and
now my dear best friend.

Stephanie can’t help but get sentimental, even in danger.

STEPHANIE
Am I really your best friend? You’re not
just saying that?

EMILY
I’m not just saying that.

STEPHANIE
Because I felt that way, too - but I
worried it was just me. I mean, it’s so
hard to connect with other Moms ...

EMILY
Tell me about it. Imagine when you have a
full-time job?
115.

STEPHANIE
Oh, don’t pull that crap! What I do is
work too, Emily. It’s a full time job!

Emily chambers a bullet and steps ahead.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)

I may not get paid for it, but believe
me, being a mother is HARD WORK. And then
I have my vlog on top of that. In fact,
maybe you’d like to be on my vlog some
time? Have you ever thought about that?

(off Emily’s confuse

look)

Like ... right now? Killing us might just
get me to a million subscribers.

Stephanie points to the HIDDEN LIPSTICK CAMERA camouflaged in
a FLOWER ARRANGEMENT by the stove.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
We're live streaming. And you just
confessed. Wave hello to the moms!
Emily locks eyes with Stephanie as it dawns on her -
Stephanie has outsmarted her. Stephanie manages a light
smile. Emily simply shakes her head.

EMILY
Oh, goddammit ...

SIRENS rise up in the background. Then Emily bolts from the
kitchen, gun in hand.

INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 188
Emily bolts through the living room, then out the front door.
EXT. EMILY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 189

Emily sprints across the lawn toward her car across the
street. SIRENS approach.

STEPHANIE
Stop! Emily!

Emily stops and turns. Stephanie runs onto the front lawn.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
It's over, Emily. You can’t outrun this.
Think of Nicky. Don’t do it to him.
You're still Lis mom.

EMILY
He may be better off without any mom.

Emily aims the gun at Stephanie, who GASPS. Emily starts to
pull the trigger when ... BLAM!!! SHE FLIPS IN THE AIR, HIT
FULL ON BY A SPEEDING PRIUS. Her gun goes flying.

Darren gets out of the car heroically.

DARREN
Toyota Prius. Silent but deadly.
116.

Darren walks over to Emily, who is prone on the ground.

DARREN (CONT'D)
Saw you on the vlog. You fuck with one of
the moms, you fuck with all of us.

Emily kicks him in the groin. As he doubles over, she tries
to_get up but can’t. She crawls on the as halt as TWO POLICE
CARS close in from the other direction, erry and blue
lights flashing, reflected in her eyes. Emi ly accepts defeat.

CAPTION: SIX MONTHS LATER
ON VIDEO VLOG - KITCHEN - DAY 190
Stephanie addresses the camera from Emily’s kitchen.

STEPHANIE
Hi, Moms. Stephanie here. Well, it’s a
big day because this morning we signed up
our one millionth subscriber, Mrs. Carol
Findley of Ames, Iowa! Thanks for joining
us, Carol. As our newest friend, you
should know that in addition to my usual
helpful tips and recipes, I am now also
taking on any unsolved mysteries. Turns
out I have a nose not only for sniffing
out the freshest basil but also criminals
who thought they got away with it. So, if
you have a cold case or a mystery to
unravel, drop me a line. But for now...
let’s focus on my favorite cold soup:
gazpacho!

EXT. PRISON YARD - YORK CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY 191

Boss’ “I DON'T GIVE A FUCK” blasts on_a boombox. We‘re in the
yard of a women’s prison in Niantic, CT. Various cliques of
women engaged in different activities and conversations. On
the basketball court, there’s a seriously competitive and cut-
throat pick-up game going down. Right in the mix is --

EMILY. Racing up and down the court like a pro. Stealing the
ball. Sweaty, athletic, take no prisoners. She looks fabulous
in her orange jumpsuit with a more natural beauty. No make-
up. hair in a messy ponytail, more herself than ever before.

e swishes the ball in the hoop and high fives her TEAMMATES
with a grin. A GUARD comes out.

GUARD
Hey, Runway. You got a visitor.

Emily peels off from the game. Her teammates groan.

INT. VISITORS ROOM - YORK CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY 192

 

Emily walks in to see Stephanie and Nicky at a table. Nicky
races toward her. She scoops him up in her arms and hugs him
so tightly he groans.

NICKY
Can’t ... breathe ...

Emily laughs and lets him go.
117.

EMILY
You're growing so fast.

Nicky pulls his lower lip down to show off his missing teeth.

EMILY (CONT'D)
And you lost another one!

NICKY
The tooth fairy got me a gumball machine.

EMILY
Well, that was nice of her.

NICKY
(with a hard look)
I know it’s Dad.

EMILY
You're getting too smart for me.

She joins Stephanie at the table, Nicky on her lap. Stephanie
pushes a plate of cookies wrapped in saran across to her.

; STEPHANIE
With agave instead of sugar.

EMILY
Good. They go a long way in here.

NICKY
Now can I have one?!

STEPHANIE
Of course, Nicky.

Nicky grabs a cookie, shoving the whole thing in his mouth.

NICKY
(mouth full)
I’m thirsty. Can I get a Coke?

STEPHANIE
I'd rather you had milk inst--
(then, with a smile)
Ask your mom.

Emily laughs and hands him a buck from a wad of cash tucked
inside her bra. He darts off to the vending machine.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
Okay. Whattaya got for me?

Emily glances over her shoulder to make sure the GUARD isn’t
listening.

EMILY
Inez Montoya. She used to be the guy’s
housekeeper before she got nabbed for
wire fraud. She says he hides cash, lots
of it, in a toolbox in the garage.

118.

STEPHANIE
That’s where they were putting it. Of
course! I knew he was guilty. Thank you.

EMILY
You keep bringing the supplies, I’1l keep
doling out the info. ’
They share a smile. Emily takes a bite of a cookie. Frowns.
EMILY (CONT'D)
Do me a favor, Dark Side. Next time, use
real sugar.

STEPHANIE
Copy that, Runway.

As the two women share a smile of mutual respect, BEGIN END
CREDITS ...

EXT. WARFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 193

 

UNDER THE END CREDITS, the BELL rings and all the kids pour
out of the school with their parents. Stephanie walks out
with her boys -- Miles and Nicky -- who have bonded like
brothers. Darren races up to Stephanie.

Stephanie begins to sign her name onto EVERY SLOT of a SIGN-
UP SHEET when -

DARREN
Stephanie! We need your help! There’s
been a terrible crime.

STEPHANIE
What?

Darren grabs her hand and hauls her off. She resists.

DARREN
Come with me, I have to show you. There’s
a dead body in the schoolyard!
(to Miles and Nicky)
Boys’ I’m borrowing your Mom!

Stephanie’s jaw drops as she follows Darren ...
EXT. WARFIELD SCHOOL - SCHOOLYARD - DAY 194

A MAN'S BODY is splayed face down on the ground. A KID (5) is
drawing a chalk outline around it. Confused, Stephanie turns
over the body and discovers -- SEAN. Grinning ear to ear.

STEPHANIE
Sean. That’s a pretty dark joke.

Sean nods to ANOTHER KID who stands next to a boom box. The
kid hits the button. MUSIC kicks in and a FLASH MOB begins.

Everyone we’ve met is there: Sona, Stacey, Darren, the
teacher Mrs. Kerry, even Detective Meany -- are there to
participate in the choreographed performance, along with all
the ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS -- Miles and Nicky at the
forefront.
119.

Two COOL KIDS, 9 and 11, watch the flash mob with disdain.

COOL KID #1
Uch. This is so 2010.

COOL KID #2
Totally embarrassing.

Stephanie stands at the center, beaming, her eyes filled with
tears as she takes in all this effort for her. At the end of
the song, Sean kneels on one knee and pops open a velvet

jewelry box. INSIDE IS THE VINTAGE DIAMOND AND SAPPHIRE RING

THAT BELONGED TO HIS MOTHER.

SEAN
Stephanie Smothers. Internet sensation
and P.I. Mom. Please say you'll marry me.
Or_I‘ll have a_ lot of explaining to do to

all these people.

STEPHANIE
Well ... I’11 have to ask the moms first.
(off his Look)
Yes. Of course I’ll marry you.

Stephanie throws herself into his arms. The crowd explodes.
It's a happy ending! Why the hell not? They’ve all been
through a lot.

FADE OUT.
