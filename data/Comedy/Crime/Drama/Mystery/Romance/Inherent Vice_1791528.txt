OVER BLACK
A sweet, young woman’s voice narrates.

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
She came along the alley and up
the back stairs the way she always
used to. Doc hadn’t seen her for
over a year. Nobody had. Back
then it was always sandals, bottom
half of a flower print bikini,
faded Country Joe & the Fish T-
shirt. Tonight, she was all in
flatland gear, hair a lot shorter
than he remembered, looking just
like she swore she’d never look...

FADE IN:
INT. DOC’S APARTMENT (GORDITA BEACH) - DUSK (1970)
DOC SPORTELLO sits half awake on his couch. He looks up,

notices someone standing at his door: SHASTA FAY
HEPWORTH (20s).

DOC
Is that you, Shasta?
SHASTA
Think you’re hallucinating...?
DOC
No... just the new package, I
guess...
SHASTA

... I need your help, Doc.

DOC
Come in. (... you know I have an
office now and everything? Just
like a day job.)

She walks in, Doc gets a slow rising BONER in his
pants... casually tries to cover it up.

SHASTA
I looked in the phone book and
almost went over there, but then I
thought better for everyone if
this looked like a secret
rendezvous.

DOC
Somebody keeping a close eye?
SHASTA
«+. I just spent an hour on
surface streets trying to make it
look good.

DOC
How about a beer?

Doc moves to the fridge, Shasta looks around, they sit
down at the kitchen table:

SHASTA
So there's this guy...

DOC
Gentlemen of the straightworld
persuasion?

SHASTA
Okay, Doc. He’s married.

DOC
And the wife -- she knows about
you?

SHASTA
But she’s seeing somebody, too.
Only it’s not just the usual -- I

think they’re working on some
creepy little scheme.

DOC
To make off with the hubby’s
fortune? I think I’ve heard this
one once or twice...

SHASTA
They want me in on it... they
think I’m the one who can reach
him when he’s vulnerable, or as
much as he ever gets.

DOC
Bare-ass and asleep?

SHASTA
I knew you’d understand.

DOC
Are you still trying to figure out
if it’s right or wrong?

SHASTA
Worse than that. How much loyalty
I owe him.
BEAT...

DOC
I hope you’re not asking me.
Beyond the usual boilerplate,
people owe anybody they’re fucking
steady...?

SHASTA
Dear Abby said the same thing.

DOC
Emotions aside, let’s look at the
money. How much of the rent’s he
been picking up?

SHASTA
All of it.

DOC
Pretty hefty?

SHASTA

For Hancock Park.

DOC
You're giving him I0Us for
everything, of course...

SHASTA
You fucker, if I’d known you were
still this bitter I wouldn’t have
come --

DOC
Me? I’m just trying to be
professional. How much are the
wifey and boyfriend offering to
cut you in for...?

DOC
So, this... this isn’t just a
couple of X-rated Polaroids, then.
Dope planted in the glove
compartment, nothin’ like that.

SHASTA
It isn’t what you’re thinking,
Doc.

DOC

Don’t worry, thinking comes later,
what else?

SHASTA
I’m not sure, but it sounds like
they want to commit him to some
kind of loony bin.
DOC
You mean legally? Or a snatch of
some kind?
SHASTA
Nobody's telling me, Doc, I’m just
the bait...
CLOSEUP - SHASTA’S FACE

Looking at Doc.

ANOTHER ANGLE

He looks at her. Can’t read her face.

DOC
Are you still taking those acting
classes?

SHASTA

Thing is: I heard you’re seeing
somebody downtown.

DOC
Oh, you mean Penny. Seeing?
Well. Nice flatland chick out in
search of hippie love thrills,
basically.

SHASTA
Also some kind of junior D.A.?

DOC
You think somebody there could
stop this before it happens?

SHASTA
There’s not too many places I
could go with this, Doc.

DOC
Okay, I’1l talk to Penny, see what
we can see. So your happy couple.
Do they have a names?

SHASTA
It's Mickey Wolfmann.

DOC
Mickey Wolfmann who's always in
the paper? The real estate big
shot?

SHASTA
You can’t tell anybody about this,
Doc.
DOC
I won’t. Deaf and dumb. That’s
part of my job. You have any
phone numbers you wanna share?

She gets a pencil, writes a number down, he watches
her...

SHASTA
Try to never use it.

DOC
How do I reach you?

SHASTA
You don’t. I moved out of my old
place. Staying where I can
anymore...

DOC
You could stay here...

CUT TO:

EXT. DOC’S - STREET - EVENING

He walks her down to her car, ‘59 CADILLAC EL DORADO
BIARITZZ --

SHASTA
Don’t come any further, somebody
might be watching by now.

DOC

Well, call me or something...
SHASTA

You never did let me down, Doc.
DOC

Don’t worry, I’ll...
SHASTA

No, I mean really ever.
DOC

Oh, sure I did.
SHASTA

No... you were always true...

She backs away, gets in the CADILLAC and drives off into
the night. MUSIC STARTS. He watches her go... HOLD WITH
DOC. DENIS (rhymes with penis) walks up, says hi, they
walk up towards town, away from the beach...

DOC
Hey, Denis, you hungry?
DENIS
Like Godzilla sez to Mothra, man,
‘let’s go eat someplace.’

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
When Doc came in that night, it
wasn’t just the usual hungry-doper
thing -- it was something else --
and with Neptune moving at last
out of the Scorpio death-trip and
rising into the Sagitarrian light
of the higher mind -- it was bound
to be something love-related and I
thought I knew what it was...

CUT TO:

INT. PIPELINE PIZZA - NIGHT

DOC and DENIS and a bunch of locals, eating pizza.
Sitting here are some SURFERS, a friend named ENSENADA
SLIM and a lovely young girl, our narrator: SORTILEGE
(20s); she speaks in the flesh...

SORTILEGE
Was that Shasta’s car I saw down
the drive?

DOC
She stuck her head in for a couple
minutes...

SORTILEGE

Are you broken up?

DOC
Kind of weird seeing her again.
Figured next time I did it’d be on
the tube not in person...

SORTILEGE looks at DOC with sweetness, then at HIS HAIR:

SORTILEGE

Better do something about that.
DOC

Again?
SORTILEGE

I can’t say it enough -- change

your hair, change your life.

DOC
What do you recommend?

SORTILEGE
That’s up to you. Follow your
intuition.
(ETC. -- Pizza talk here.)
CUT TO:

INT. DOC’S APARTMENT

He sits on his couch. THE MUSIC PLAYS. He’s on the
phone, it’s ringing to no answer. His hair is rolled
into plantation-style knots. He’s rolling a joint.

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
There was an ancient superstition
at the beach, something like the
surfer belief that burning your
board will bring awesome waves,
and it went like this: Take a Zig-
Zag paper and write your dearest
wish, and then use it to roll a
joint of the best dope you can
find and smoke it all up, and your
wish would be granted. Doc’s wish
was simple... (just that Shasta
Fay be safe...)

He writes on the rolling papers a small note in pencil:
“To Shasta’s Safety. With Love, Doc.” Smokes it and
calls his AUNT REET (50s) who lives down the street --

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. AUNT REET’S HOUSE

She’s applying ten tons of various makeups, spraying some
on, applying with ten gallon brushes and dipping her face
into other paints.

AUNT REET
Make it quick, Larry, I’ve got a
live one tonight and a quarter ton
of makeup to put on yet --

DOC
Okay. Mickey Wolfmann, what can
you tell me?

AUNT REET
Powerhouse in L.A. real estate
from the desert to the sea --
Technically Jewish but wants to be

a Nazi -- what’s he to you?
DOC
Shasta... she came around... told

me about a possible plot to snatch
up Wolfmann by his wife and her
boyfriend.
AUNT REET
And what is Shasta's role in all
this?

DOC

Like how passionately does she
feel about her flame Mickey? I
didn’t ask. ‘I love him’ is

probably the answer, what else?

AUNT REET
Is she paying you?

DOC
Mmm...

AUNT REET

Pause. Silence. Big surprise.
Listen, if Shasta can’t pay you,
maybe that means Mickey dumped her
and she’s blaming the wife and
wants revenge.

DOC
Possible. But say I just wanted
to hang out and rap with this
Wolfmann?

AUNT REET
I wouldn’t recommend your usual
approach, he goes around with a
dozen bikers, mostly Aryan
Brotherhood alumni -- all court
certified bad-asses.

DOC
Wait, wait, wait, I flunked social
studies: Jews and Aryan
Brotherhood. Isn’t there
something about hatred?

AUNT REET
Mickey’s eccentric. More and more
lately. I would say stoned out of
his fuckin’ mind, since he
discovered drugs, no offense to
you, Doc.

DOC
So where would I find him
accidentally?

AUNT REET
I promised my little sister that
I'd never put her baby in the way
of danger.
5A

DOC
I’m cool with the Brotherhood,
Aunt Reet, I know their secret
handshake and everything.

AUNT REET
It’s your ass -- try the Channel
View Estates, his latest insult to
the environment.

DOC
Channel View Estates. The one
Bigfoot Bjornsen does the
commercials for?

AUNT REET
That’s the one. Maybe your old
cop buddy’s the one who should be
taking care of your case.

DOC
I did think of going to Bigfoot
but just as I reached for the
phone, history and all, I thought,
‘naaahhhhh.’

AUNT REET
Maybe you're better off with the
Nazis. Call your mother once in a
while so she knows you’re alive...

Doc gets up and walks to the TV, switches the channel,
finds:

INSERT - ON TELEVISION 5A

The commercial for “Channel View Estates” comes on after
a bad horror movie: It has LT. BIGFOOT BJORNSEN dressed
as a “hippie.” He’s wearing an ankle-length velvet cape
in paisley, love beads, shades with peace symbols and an
Afro wig. He’s like Cal Worthington, except for live
animals, he has a pack of SCREAMING KIDS that do
cannonballs in the pool of a MODEL HOME that Bigfoot’s
showing off and listing details and financing options,
etc... Bigfoot turns to the CAMERA:

BIGFOOT (V.O.)
Those 1i’l kids, wow, they're
really something, huh!

BACK TO SCENE
Doc looks confused. Bigfoot, ON SCREEN seems to be

looking STRAIGHT AT DOC... and DOC looks back... HOLD
THEIR LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
10.

DOC
So what's all this now...
Fucking Bigfoot. Well, wouldn't
you know. Why does the LAPD need

SAG cards?

AUNT REET
I have major liquid liner issues
to deal with here, Larry -- I'm

getting off now --
She hangs up. DOC doesn't notice and keeps talking.
CUT TO:

EXT. LSD INVESTIGATIONS - DOC'S OFFICE - DAY
Doc comes into the office, greets PETUNIA...
PETUNIA
Morning, Doc. What's on your
head?
DOC
Howdy, Petunia. Still married to
what's his name?
PETUNIA
Oh, Doc. You've got somebody
waiting for you...

CUT TO:

INT. DOC'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

A large, imposing black man: TARIQ KHALIL (30s, Black
Panther style) is waiting for him:

TARIQ
Doctor Sportello?

DOC
That's right...

TARIQ

Tariq Kahlil.
Doc collects himself, note pad, etc...

DOC
Okay -- so how can I help you?

TARIQ
There's this white guy I was in
the joint with. Aryan
Brotherhood. We did some
business, now we're both out. And
he still owes me.

(MORE)
11.
TARIQ (CONT'D)
It's a lot of money. I can't give

you details.
I swore an oath I wouldn't tell.

DOC
How about just his name?
TARIQ
Glen Charlock.
DOC

You know where he's staying now?

TARIQ
Only who he works for. He's a
bodyguard for a builder named
Wolfmann.

MOMENT. Doc writes: paranoia alert.

DOC
If you don't mind my asking, Mr.
Kahlil, how did you hear about me?

TARIQ
Sledge Poteet.

DOC
Wow. Blast from the past.

TARIQ
Said you helped him out of a
situation back in '67.

DOC
First time I ever got shot at.
You guys know each other from the
place?

TARIQ
That's right -- they were teachin'
us both how to cook.

DOC
I remember him when he couldn't
boil water. So if you don't mind
an obvious question: You know
where this Glen Charlock works
now, why not just go over there,
look him up directly?

TARIQ
Because Wolfmann is surrounded day
and night with the Aryan
Brotherhood Army and outside of
Glen, I've never enjoyed the
company of Nazis.
12.

DOC
So send some white guy in to get
his head hammered.

TARIQ
More or less.

DOC
When you were inside, were you in
a gang?

TARIQ

Black Guerrilla Family.

DOC
And you say you did business with
the who now, the Aryan
Brotherhood? Can you explain that
to me...

TARIQ
We found we shared many of the
same opinions about the U.S.
government.

DOC
Alright, that racial harmony.
I can dig it. There something
else?

TARIQ
My old street gang. Artesia
Crips. When I got out of Chino I
went looking for some of them and
found it ain't just them gone, but
the whole turf itself.

DOC
What do you mean ‘gone’?

TARIQ
Not there. Grind up in little
pieces. Seagulls all pickin' at
it. Figure I must be trippin',
drive around for a while, come
back, everything's still gone.

DOC
Uh-huh.

TARIQ
Nobody and nothing. A ghost town
except for this big sign, ‘Coming
Soon On This Site.’ Guess who the
builder is...?

DOC
Wolfmann again.
13.

TARIQ
That's it.

DOC
Can you show me on the map?

They look at map.

BEAT.

DOC
So you're, like, what again,
Japanese?

TARIQ

How long you been doin' this?

DOC
Looks closer to Gardena than
Compton is all I'm sayin'.

TARIQ
WW Two. Before the war, a lot of
South Central was still a Japanese
neighborhood. Those people got
sent to camps, we come on in to be
the new Japs.

DOC
And now it's your turn to get
moved along.

TARIQ
More white man's revenge. Freeway
up by the airport wasn't enough.

DOC
Revenge for...?

TARIQ
Watts.

DOC
The riots?

TARIQ

Some of us say, ‘insurrection.’
The Man, he just waits for his
moment...

DOC
If I can get ahold of your prison
buddy, this Glen Charlock, will he
honor his debt to you?

TARIQ
I can't tell you what it is. I
swore an oath...
14.

DOC
No need.

TARIQ
And I can't give you nothin' up
front.

DOC

Groovy with that.

TARIQ
Sledge was right: You are one
crazy white motherfucker.

DOC
How can you tell?
TARIQ
I counted.
DOC
Lemme look around -- I'll see what

I see. Alright?

CUT TO:

A8 INT. DOC'S CAR A8
DRIVING TO CHANNEL VIEW ESTATES.

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
Long, sad history of L.A. land use
-- Mexican families bounced out of
Chavez Ravine to build Dodger
Stadium, American Indians swept
out of Bunker Hill for the Music
Center and now Tariq's
neighborhood bulldozed aside for
Channel View Estates...

CUT TO:

8 EXT. CHANNEL VIEW ESTATES - DAY 8

DOC drives down the street, past a bunch of BLACK
PEDESTRIANS walking around, looking for their homes...
it’s like driving through lost cattle --

DOC pulls his DODGE DART into this UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DEVELOPMENT. STREETS AREN'T PAVED, BUT THERE ARE STREET
SIGNS, VARIOUS SUPPOSED TO BE SMALL SPANISH TYPE HOMES
BEING BUILT... It's quiet.

There's a MAKESHIFT MINI MALL erected for the
construction crews. There's a BEER BAR, LIQUOR STORE,
SANDWICH PLACE and a MASSAGE PARLOR called CHICK PLANET
with a row of Harleys precision parked in a row out
front.
15.

Doc parks and musters some courage, passes over the
Harleys -- bathes himself in a white glow -- and enters
the massage parlor...

INT. CHICK PLANET MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

Doc steps in... it's quiet and very dark. A sexy young
Asian girl in a bikini: JADE (20s).

JADE
Hi, I'm Jade? Please take note of
today's Pussy Eater's Special
which is good all day till closing

time?

DOC
Mmmm... how much is it?

JADE
$14.95.

DOC

Errr, not that $14.95 ain't a
totally groovy price, but I'm
really trying to locate this guy
who works for Mr. Wolfmann?

JADE
Does he eat pussy?

DOC
Fella named Glen Charlock?

JADE
Oh, sure. Glen comes in here. He
eats pussy. You got a cigarette
for me?

He taps her out a smoke.
JADE

Ohhhh. Lock up style. Not much
eating pussy in there, huh?

DOC
Glen and I were both in Chino
around the same time... have you

seen him today?

JADE
If you're a cop, you're entitled
to a free preview of our Pussy
Eater's Special.

DOC
How about a licensed P.I.?

JADE
Hey, Bambi?
10

16.

BAMBI comes out, wearing day-glo bikini. Jade reaches
into Bambi's bikini bottom and before you know it -- They
disappear below the reception desk. Doc watches... ina
flash reflected behind him we see a BALD HEAD, SWASTIKA
TATTOO AND THEN SOMETHING COMES DOWN ON DOC'S HEAD -- AND
HE'S OUT.

CUT TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK

WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF THE MOTORCYCLES FIRING UP AND
TEARING OFF...

ANGLE - LATER 10
Doc comes to... lump on his head... he steps outside,
opens the door, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM OUT TO REVEAL:

CUT TO:
EXT. CHANNEL VIEW ESTATES - DAY 11

LAPD, DETECTIVES AND CORONER ARE ON SITE AT WHAT IS NOW A
CRIME SCENE. A line of POLICE CARS AIM AT DOC led by
DETECTIVE LT. CHRISTIAN F. "BIGFOOT" BJORNSEN, eating a
chocolate-covered frozen banana and hollering through a
bullhorn... Doc steps out, guns aim at him... A DEAD BODY
ON THE GROUND BETWEEN HIM AND THE LAPD...

BIGFOOT
Congratulations, hippie scum. And
welcome to a world of
inconvenience... Yes, this time it
appears you have finally managed
to stumble into something too real
and deep to hallucinate your
worthless hippie ass of -- without
wishing to seem impatient --
anytime you'd like to join us,
we'd so like to chat...

DOC
Bigfoot, what happened...! I
remember massage parlor -- Asian
chick named Jade and Anglo friend
Bambi --

BIGFOOT

Wishful figments of a brain
pickled in cannabis fumes, no
doubt.

DOC
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
17.

BIGFOOT
Sure.

12 ANGLE - LATER 12

Doc is in cuffs, sitting on the ground. THERE'S A CORPSE
COVERED ON A GURNEY that is taken past. It is a bloody
mess, body parts are falling out onto the ground -- Doc
is getting sick at the sight of it.

BIGFOOT
I can almost pity your civilian
distress. Though if you were more
of a man and less of a ball-less
hippie draft dodger, who knows,
you might have seen enough over in
the 'Nam to share even my own
sense of professional ennui at the
sight of one more stiff.

DOC
Who is it?

BIGFOOT
Was, Sportello. Here on Earth we
say, ‘was.’ Meet Glen Charlock.

Whom you were asking for by name
only hours ago, witnesses will
swear to that. Furthermore, on
the face of it, you've chosen to
ice a personal bodyguard of

the rather well-connected Mickey
Wolfmann. Name rings bell? Or in
your case shakes tambourine? Ah,
but here's our ride --

A POLICE CRUISER COMES TO A SLIDING STOP NEXT TO DOC AND

BIGFOOT.
DOC
Where's my ride?
BIGFOOT
Like it's owner, on its way to
impoundment.
CUT TO:
13 INT. PARKER CENTER - DAY 13

Doc in custody sitting across from Bigfoot.

BIGFOOT
So when you and Glen had your
fatal encounter, when would you
say that was in the series of
events?
18.

DOC
I told you the first time I ever
saw him, he was dead.

BIGFOOT
His associates, then. How many of
them were you already acquainted
with?

DOC
Not normally guys I'd hang out
with, Bigfoot, totally wrong drug
profile.

BIGFOOT
Potheads, you're so exclusive.
Would you say you took offense at
Glen's preference for barbiturates
and amphetamines?

DOC
Yes. I was planning to report him
to the Dope Fiend Standards and
Ethics Committee next week...

BIGFOOT
Now your ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay
Hepworth is a known intimate of
Glen's employer, Mickey Wolfmann.
Do you think Glen and Shasta were --

Bigfoot slides his fingers around, makes a "fucking"
sign.

BIGFOOT
How does it make you feel? Here
you are still carrying the torch
and there she is in the company of
all those Nazi lowlifes?

DOC
Keep doing that, Bigfoot, you're
givin' me a hard-on...

BIGFOOT
Tough little wop monkey as my man
Fatso Judson always sez.

DOC
Case you forget, Lieutenant, you
and me are almost in the same
business, except I don't get that
free pass to shoot people all the
time and so forth. But if I was
in your seat, I guess I'd be
acting the same way, maybe start
in next with remarks about my
mother.

(MORE)
19.
DOC (CONT'D)
Or I guess your mother, because
you'd be me... Have I got that
right?

Bigfoot pretends to read notes:

BIGFOOT
While suspect -- that's you -- is
having alleged midday nap, so
necessary to the hippie lifestyle,
some sort of incident occurs in
the vicinity of Channel View
Estates. Firearms are discharged.
When the dust settles, we find one
Glen Charlock deceased. More
compellingly for LAPD, the man
Charlock was supposed to be
guarding, Michael Z. Wolfmann, has
vanished, giving local law
enforcement less than 24 hours
before the feds call it a
kidnapping and come in to fuck
everything up. Perhaps,
Sportello, you could help
forestall this by providing the
names of the other members of your
cult?

DOC
Cult.

BIGFOOT
No one would ever be stupid enough
to attempt this alone, which
suggests some kind of Mansanoid
conspiracy, wouldn't you agree?
I've been referred to more than
once by the L.A. Times as a
Renaissance detective, which means
that I am many things--
and one thing I am not is stupid --
and purely out of noblesse oblige
I extend this assumotion to cover
you as well...

Enter DOC'S LAWYER, SAUNCHO SMILAX (30s).

SAUNCHO
Lieutenant! You know that you
don't have any case here, so if
you're going to charge him,
you better, otherwise --

DOC
Sauncho, remember who this is
you're talking to, it's Bigfoot
Bjornsen, renaissance cop.

SAUNCHO
Charge him or let him go, you have
no case...
20.

DOC
Bigfoot, don't mind him, he
watches too many courtroom dramas.

BEAT. They all look at each other...

SAUNCHO
What's the beef here exactly?

BIGFOOT
It doesn't have much to do with
your speciality, which I
understand is marine law.

SAUNCHO
There's plenty of crime on the
high seas.

BIGFOOT

So far we have murder and
kidnapping, we can work in pirates
if that would make you more
comfortable -- either way it's
high profile.

SAUNCHO
Yes, but given your history with
my client -- you know this is

harassment, there's no case,
this'll never make it to trial.

BIGFOOT
We probably could take this all
the way to trial -- but with our

luck the jury pool will be 99
percent hippie --

SAUNCHO
Sure, unless you got the venue
changed to maybe, like, Orange

County -- not as many hippies down
there --
DOC
Sauncho, who are you working for?
SAUNCHO
Clients pay for work.
BIGFOOT
I've decided I'm going to kick Mr.
Sportello.
SAUNCHO
You're gonna kick him? That's
assault!
DOC

(I think it's police slang
Sauncho. It means cut me loose.)
21.

BIGFOOT
I'll release the suspect at the
impound garage...

SAUNCHO
«+. promise?

BIGFOOT
Promise. And I'll even give hima
ride myself.

SAUNCHO
Alright, I'm glad we got this
worked out then -- remember, Doc:

This was like 15 billable minutes.

CUT TO:
14 INT. BIGFOOT'S EL CAMINO (MOVING) 14
Driving in silence. Bigfoot suddenly makes a sharp U-
turn --
DOC
Where we going?
BIGFOOT
To a nice, secluded spot that has
‘shot while trying to escape’
written all over it.
CUT TO:
15 INT. HILLS ABOVE VALLEY - DAY 15

Bigfoot walks Doc deep into the mountainside. Finally
sits him down, stands over him...

BIGFOOT
Are you aware of the dictum that
dope will get you through times of
no money better than vice versa...
You'd be surprised how many in
your own hippie freak community
have found our Special Employee
Disbursements useful.

DOC
.-. what do you mean? You mean
like ‘Mod Squad’? Rat on
everybody I ever met?

BIGFOOT
Right now there's fistfuls of
greenbacks flowing at anything
that even looks like local law
enforcement.

22.

BIGFOOT (CONT'D)
Federal funding as far as the eye
can see... or we could certainly
offer you compensation in a more
inhalable form... Acapulco Gold.
Panama Red. Michoacan Icepack.
Our downtown evidence rooms got
filled up long ago, Doc.
Numberless
kilos of righteous weed just for
you. Just for trivial information
we already have anyway. And what
you don't smoke, improbable as
that seems, you could always sell.

DOC
Are you married, Bigfoot?

BIGFOOT
Sorry, you're not my type. What
does this look like? Or don't
they have them on planet hippie?

DOC
You have kids?

BIGFOOT
I hope this isn't some kind of
veiled doper threat.

DOC
It's just strange that here we
both are with this mysterious
power to ruin each other's day and
we don't even know anything about
each other.

BIGFOOT
Aimless doper's drivel and yet
you've just defined the very
essence of law enforcement. So
how about my offer?

DOC
Yours is the last wallet I'd want
money out of, Bigfoot...

CUT TO:

INT. DOC'S PLACE - LATER 16

Doc's been released. He's watching BIGFOOT on TV from
the newscast at CHANNEL VIEW ESTATES.

DOC half watches, smokes the end of a joint and rolls

The PHONE RINGS:

DOC
Hello?
23.

TARIQ (V.O.)
I didn't do it.

DOC
Nobody said you did... Who is
this?

TARIQ (V.O.)

If Glen was a target, then I am,
too. Better not be in contact,
man. This is not some bunch of
fools like the LAPD. And if you
don't mind a piece of free advice -
- forget it all.

Dial tone...

CLOSEUP - JOINT

It's done. He's smoked it all. He lies on the couch.

ANOTHER ANGLE
THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN: It's Bigfoot.

DOC
Hello?

BIGFOOT (V.O.)
So we sent some Police Academy
hotshot over to the last known
address of Shasta Fay Hepworth,
just a routine visit and guess
what?

DOC
Fuck, no, not this.

BIGFOOT (V.O.)
Relax -- don't be so sensitive --
all we know at this point is that
she's disappeared now, too, just
like her boyfriend Mickey... do
you think there could be a
connection? Maybe they ran off
together?

DOC
Bigfoot, can we at least try and
be professional about all this
from now on.

BIGFOOT (V.O.)

I am being professional. There's

certain things I can't tell you

because you aren't on payroll.

BIGFOOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If anything occurs to you about
where they went -- don't forget to

share that with me, will you?

DOC
What's the last address you have?

Bigfoot has already hung up.
The phone rings again.

DOC
(into phone)
Hello?

HOPE HARLINGEN (V.O.)
Mr. Sportello?

DOC
Yes?

HOPE HARLINGEN (V.O.)
I got your number at the head shop
in Gordita Beach. It's about my
husband. He used to be a close
friend of your friend -- Shasta
Fay Hepworth?

DOC
And you're?

HOPE HARLINGEN (V.O.)
Hope Harlingen.

DOC
Okay. And he's...?

HOPE HARLINGEN (V.O.)

Dead.
CUT TO:
INT. DOC'S CAR Al7
Driving to Hope’s house. CLEAN OF SORTILEGE.
EXT. TORRANCE - SMALL HOUSE 17

Inside this nice, little house, DOC sits at the breakfast
table with a sweet faced young woman: HOPE HARLINGEN
(20s). (NOTE: Still need a ref. to her false
teeth/calcium/heroin. )
25.

HOPE HARLINGEN
Inside the surf-sax category Coy
passed for a towering figure,
because he actually improvised
once in a while instead of how
second and third choruses get
repeated note for note?

DOC
You're right. I love surf music --
but some of the worst blues work
ever recorded will be showing up
on karmic rap sheets of surf-sax
players.

HOPE HARLINGEN
It was never his work I was in
love with. Coy and I should have
met cute but actually we met
squalid, down at Oscar's in San
Ysidro --

DOC
Oh, boy.

HOPE HARLINGEN
I had just gone running into a
toilet stall without checking
first, had my finger already down
my throat, to throw up the balloon
of dope I'd just scored in Mexico
and there Coy sat, gringo
digestion, about to take a giant
shit. We both let go about the
same time, barf and shit all over
the place, me with my face in his
lap and to complicate things, he
had this hard-on... Next thing we
knew here came Amethyst, and
pretty soon this is what we had
her looking like...

She hands him SOME OLD POLAROID PICTURES.

DOC
AAAHHHAHAH! !

HOPE HARLINGEN
Everybody we knew helpfully
pointed out how heroin was coming
through in my breast milk, but who
could afford to buy formula? It's
a long way from my job now. I'ma
drug counselor -- talking kids
into sensible drug use...

Doc looks very confused for a moment. (What's that?)

DOC CANNOT HELP BUT STARE AT HOPE'S TEETH AND MAKE FUNNY
MOUTH MOVEMENTS WATCHING HER SPEAK...
26.

HOPE HARLINGEN
You're staring at my teeth?

DOC
Huh? No? (Sensible drug use)
Yes.

HOPE HARLINGEN
Heroin sucks the calcium out of
your system like a vampire, use it
at any length of time and your
teeth go all to hell. And that's
the good part.

DOC
So... this thing that happened to
your husband?

HOPE HARLINGEN
Whatever he took that killed him,
wasn't California smack, for sure.

DOC
Who was the dealer?

HOPE HARLINGEN
El Drano in Venice.

DOC
Was Coy a steady customer?

HOPE HARLINGEN
Known him for years -- what does a
dealer care? Overdoses are good
for business --

DOC
Sudden herds of junkies showing up
at the door thinking it must be
some really good shit? Something
like that?

HOPE HARLINGEN
You got it. Mr. Sportello, I
don't think Coy is really dead.

DOC
Did you I.D. the body?

HOPE HARLINGEN
No. Whoever called me said
somebody from his band did that.

DOC
It's supposed to be next of kin.

HOPE HARLINGEN
And this... this deposit showed up
close to his disappearance.
27.

She brings out a BANK STATEMENT book and shows it to him,
points to a CREDIT. Doc raises his eyebrows at the
amount.

DOC
Interesting sum.

HOPE HARLINGEN
He had no insurance policies that
I knew about... Why would this big
deposit suddenly appear in our
account and be anonymous?

DOC
Is there a picture of Coy you
could spare?

She hands him a BOX FULL OF POLAROIDS. Doc looks inside.
We see: COY HARLINGEN. Coy with the baby, Coy cooking
heroin, Coy tying off, Coy shooting up, Coy and Hope out
at the beach, sitting in a pizza joint playing tug-of-war
with the last slice, sticking his dick in his saxophone.

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
These were perilous times,
astrologically speaking, for
dopers -- especially those of high
school age, who'd been born most
of them, under a ninety-degree
aspect, the unluckiest angle
possible, between Neptune,

the doper's planet, and Uranus,
the planet of rude surprises. Doc
had known it to happen that those
left behind would refuse to
believe that people they loved or
even took the same classes with
were really dead. They came up
with all kinds of alternate
stories so it wouldn't have to be
true.

DOC
Okay if I take this one?

HOPE HARLINGEN
Sure.
18 AT THE DOOR - MOMENTS LATER 18
Doc's on his way out. Just one more thing...
DOC

How did your husband know Shasta
Fay?

She picked us up hitchhiking... I
think Coy and her somehow stayed

in touch... but I don't know for
sure...

DRIVING TO SLOANE WOLFMANN'S.
Doc in his disguise...

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
Shasta had mentioned a possible
laughing academy angle to Mickey
Wolfmann's matrimonial drama and
Doc thought it might be
interesting to see how society
page superstar Mrs. Sloane
Wolfmann would react when somebody
brought up the topic... If Mickey
was currently being held against
his will in some private nuthouse,
then Doc's immediate chore would
be to try and find out
which one...

CUT TO:

INT. WOLFMANN MANSION (SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS) - DAY 20

DOC rings the doorbell. He's dressed in a disguise of a
DOUBLE-BREASTED SUIT, SHORT HAIR WIG, LOAFERS. The door
is opened by a sexy young Chicana: LUZ (20s).

LUZ
Who are you supposed to be?

DOC
Good afternoon, here to see Mrs.
Wolfmann.

LUZ
She's hanging by the pool with all
the police and them... come
inside.
29.

LUZ

So you're the shrink that called?
DOC

That's right.
LUZ

Uh-huh...

Out back, by the pool, LAPD are set up in A COMMAND POST
by the pool cabana. They're also swimming in the pool,
making margaritas and playing Ping Pong.

SLOANE WOLFMANN (40s, British, ex-showgirl) strolls
towards the house wearing a black bikini, black shawl,
black high heel sandals. She steps into the main living
room to greet Doc... and stops, landing in what appears
to be the MOST INSANELY GORGEOUS MOVIE STAR LIGHTING IN
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

SLOANE
Do you like the lighting?
DOC
Uh-huh.
SLOANE

Jimmy Wong Howe did it for us
years ago. LUZ! The midday
refrescos now, if you wouldn't
mind?

They sit down. Luz comes in and pours drinks, shows her
ass to Doc while pouring...

DOC
Your husband was planning to endow
a new wing for our facility -- he

actually tendered us a sum in
advance. But somehow it just
didn't seem right to keep the
money while so little was known

of his whereabouts. So, we'd like
to refund you the sum, and if, and
as we all pray when, Mr. Wolfmann
is next heard from, why then,
perhaps the

process can resume.

SLOANE
We did recently endow another
facility, in Ojai... Chryskylodon
Institute.

DOC
Kriskleddone? Errrr... yesss,
uhhh...
30.

SLOANE
An ancient Indian word that means,
‘serenity.’ Are you somehow a
subsidiary...?

DOC
Perhaps one of our Sister

Sanatoria?

Enter RIGGS WARBLING. Big, muscular and blond, spiritual
coach, wearing a tiny swim shorts.

SLOANE
Mr. Riggs Warbling... my spiritual
coach.

DOC
How'd you do?

RIGGS
Pleasureable.

DOC

(to Sloane)
Maybe you can tell us where to
send this refund and what form

you'd like it in?

RIGGS
Small bills! Non-consecutive
serial numbers!

SLOANE
Riggs. Enough. Always making
with the tasteless jokes. Perhaps
if one of your company officers
simply endorsed Michael's check
back to one of his accounts?

DOC
Of course!
SLOANE
Let me just find you a deposit

form...

She gets up and walks over to a desk, revealing a low cut
back and exposing her back...

DOC
You're a spiritual advisor, Mr.
Warbling?

RIGGS

And a contractor.

DOC
You work for Mr. Wolfmann?

RIGGS looks back to SLOANE WOLFMANN, says to Doc:

As long as you don't steal
anything.

DOC

Muchas gracias, there, Luz.
I won't be a minute.

INT. PALATIAL BATHROOM —- THAT MOMENT 22

DOC snoops around, goes into a cavernous WALK-IN CLOSET
and notices: A RACK DEDICATED TO SOME STRANGE NECKTIES.
VINTAGE SILK TIES, HAND-PAINTED WITH A DIFFERENT NUDE
WOMAN ON EACH. ERECT CLITS, SPREAD PUSSY LIPS, EACH
WOMAN IN A DIFFERENT POSE. HE COMES ACROSS ONE OF
SLOANE. SUDDENLY, THERE'S A HAND AROUND HIS BACK.

HOLY SHIT.

LUZ
I'm in there somewhere. Keep
looking.

DOC

Huh huh huhuhuhuhu.

LUZ
There I am. Cute, huh? My tits
aren't really that big, but it's
the thought that counts.

LUZ
Shasta. Yeah. She's in there

someplace. Mickey always used to

take me in the shower to fuck.

never got a chance to do anything

on that groovy bed in there.

SLOANE (0.S.)
LUZ! DONDE ESTAS, MI HIJATA??

LUZ

Another time, perhaps. You're not

really a shrink are you?

DOC
No. But I do have a couch.

LUZ
Piscodelico, ese!

She flashes her teeth. He hands her one of the FAKE

BUSINESS CARDS with his real number on it.

CUT TO:

Doc is sitting in a lunch spot downtown populated with an
assortment of JUDGES, LAWYERS, all completely DRUNK at
lunchtime. In walks DEPUTY D.A. PENNY KIMBALL (30s).

PENNY
This Wolfmann-Charlock case.
Apparently, one of your old
girlfriends is a principal?

DOC
I just heard that she skipped.

PENNY
Put it another way: How close

were you and Shasta Fay Hepworth?
33.

DOC
Well, now, I've been asking myself
that very question. It was all
over years ago. Months? If you
hadn't come along, babe, who knows
how bad it might've got?

PENNY
True. You were a fucking mess
when I met you.

DOC
And how ‘bout now?

PENNY
Old times aside, have you had any
contact with Miss Hepworth, in,
say, the last week or so?

DOC
Well, now, funny you should ask
because she called me up a couple
days ago before Mickey Wolfmann
disappeared with a story about how
his wife and her boyfriend were
plotting to hustle Mickey
into the booby hatch and grab all
his money. So I sure hope you
guys, or the cops or whoever, are
looking into that.

PENNY
And with your years of experience
as a P.I., would you call that a
reliable lead?

DOC
I've known worse. Or are you all
just gonna just ignore that? Some
hippie chick with boyfriend
trouble, brains all mushed up with
dope, sex, rock and roll --

PENNY
I've never seen you this
emotional, Doc.

DOC
‘Cause the lights are out,
usually. I've never had lunch
with you before.

PENNY
You didn't tell any of this to
Lieutenant Bjornsen when he pulled
you in at the crime scene? And
Bjornsen seems to think you're as
good a suspect as any --
34.

DOC
‘Seems to’?? You've been talking
to Bigfoot? About me??

PENNY

Doc. Shhh. Please. Besides,
maybe you did do it, has that
crossed your mind yet? Maybe

you just forgot? (Maybe you just
conveniently forgot about it the
way you do so often forget things
and this peculiar reaction of
yours is a typically twisted way
of confessing the act?)

DOC
Did do what?

PENNY
Kill Glenn Charlock.

DOC
Kill him? What? How would I
forget something like that?

PENNY
Grass and who knows what else,
Doc.

DOC
I'm only a light smoker.

PENNY
How many joints a day do you
smoke?

DOC
I... I'11 have to check the log
book.

PENNY

You can't remember?

DOC
I don't keep track.

PENNY
Or maybe you can't keep track.

DOC
I don't think my smoking has any
link to the Wolfmann-Charlock,
Shasta case --

PENNY
.+. No? Why did Shasta Fay
Hepworth dismantle your
relationship?
35.

DOC
She had other fish to fry.

PENNY
Would you say you're still in love
with her?

DOC

No. Wait, what is this, I'm not --

PENNY
Hectic week ahead for me, so
unless any of this heats up
dramatically, I hope you
understand.

DOC
Wouldn't it be nice...

PENNY
Walk me back to my office? I have
to swing by the Federal
Courthouse...

25 EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY 25

DOC and PENNY enter. She guides the way, into the
waiting arms of: TWO FBI AGENTS BORDERLINE and
FLATWEED... Penny keeps walking, having set him up...

FLATWEED
I am Agent Flatweed and this is
Agent Borderline.

DOC
Did I miss an episode...?

FLATWEED
It's come to our attention that
not too long ago you had a visit
from a black prison militant
calling himself Tariq Khalil. We
naturally became curious.

26 INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - OFFICE - DAY 26
In a tiny office.

BORDERLINE
We like investigating and spending
energy on Black Nationalist hate
groups...

FLATWEED
It's the chronology, really.
Khalil visits your place of
business.

(MORE)
36.

FLATWEED (CONT'D)
Next day, a known prison
acquaintance of his, Glen
Charlock, is slain, Michael
Wolfmann disappears, and you get
arrested and let go on suspicion.

DOC
So what do you want with me?

FLATWEED
Ordinarily, we're the one's asking
the questions.

DOC
Sure thing, fellas, except aren't
we all in the same business?

FLATWEED
There's no need to be insulting.

BORDERLINE
Why don't you just share with
us what Mr. Khalil had to say the
other day when he visited you?

DOC
Because he's a client, so that's
privileged is why.

BODERLINE
If it has a bearing on the
Wolfmann case, we might have to
disagree.

DOC
I wish I could help -- but what I
can't figure is if your shop is
really so focused on the Black
Panthers and all that then what's
with your interest in Mickey
Wolfmann?

LONG PAUSE. No one says anything.

DOC
... Are you guys figuring Mickey's
kidnapping as a Black Panther
operation? Did they put the
snatch on Mickey to make a
political point? A nice shot at
some ransom money?

Flatweed and Borderline blink a lot and look nervous.

DOC
Maybe you've at least thought
of putting that out there as a
cover story for whatever did
happen? Can I be frank for a
minute?
27

37.

FLATWEED/BORDERLINE
Of course.

DOC
Fly me to the moon... let me
swing among those stars... Tell
Penny how nice our time has
been...

FLATWEED
As a COINTELPRO informant you
could be making up to three
hundred dollars a month, Larry.
Consider that.

EXT. DOC'S OFFICE - DAY 27

Doc comes walking up to his office and sees: JADE and
BAMBI, from the Chick Planet Massage, running away from
his office, hopping into a HARLEY EARLE IMPALA and
peeling out...

He walks over to PETUNIA who hands him a flyer for CHICK
PLANET MASSAGE PUSSY EATER'S SPECIAL, shakes her head and
looks sad:

PETUNIA
Oh, Doc. It's dark and lonely
work, but someone has to do it?

DOC
I can explain this...

poc turns it over, written across the back it reads:

JADE (V.O.)
‘Heard they cut you loose. Need
to see you about something. I'm
working weeknights at Club
Asiatique in San Pedro. Love and
Peace, Jade. P.S. BEWARE THE
GOLDEN FANG!!!"

Doc notices, out the window, across the parking lot:
BIGFOOT'S EL CAMINO parked in the distance, engine fired
up and watching Doc...

DISSOLVE TO:

JADE
See me outside, okay?
CUT TO:
29 EXT. BEHIND THE CLUB/SAN PEDRO DOCKS - NIGHT 29

Behind the club, on the docks, she speaks:

JADE
I can't stay here long. This is
Golden Fang territory. And a girl
don't necessarily want to get into
difficulties with those folks.

DOC
What is it? A band?

JADE
You wish. I just wanted to say how
sorry I was. I felt shitty about
what I did...

DOC
Which was what again?

JADE
I'm not a snitch. The cops told
us they'd drop charges if we just
put you at the scene, which they

already knew you were -- so where
was the harm? I'm like, so sorry,
Larry...
DOC
Call me Doc. It's cool, Jade.
JADE
That copper?
DOC
Bigfoot?
JADE

He's a warped sheet of plastic.

DOC
And was it Bigfoot who put me on
the Buenos Noches Express? Or did
he subcontract it?

JADE
I missed all that, man. Last
thing I remember was eating
Bambi's pussy -- and Puck
Beaverton's tattoo -- like it was
pulsating...
39.

DOC
What's a Puck Beaverton?

JADE
He's an asshole you don't want to
meet. Me and Bambi, we're so
freaked with the BadAss Brigade
stomping in there we didn't stick
around --

DOC
How about those jailhouse Nazis
who were supposed to be covering
Mickey's back?

JADE
All over the place one minute,
gone the next. Like a raid, when
people know it's gonna happen?
They all cleared out except for

Glenn.
DOC
Like someone forgot to tell him
something?
JADE
Listen -- there's somebody who

wants to talk to you. He thinks
you can help each other out. He's
a new face. I'm not even sure of
his name but I know he's in some

trouble.

Okay...
JADE motions over her shoulder... OUT OF THE MIST
WALKS... COY HARLINGEN. DOC blinks a few times. JADE
disappears.

Howdy, Coy.
coy
I would've come to your office,
man.

But I thought there might be
unfriendly eyeballs.

DOC
Is this safe enough for you. Out
here?

coy

Let's light this and pretend we
came out to smoke.

They light a joint and pass it back and forth.
40.

coy
I'm supposed to be dead.

DOC
There's also a rumor that you're
not.

coy
That don't come as such great
news. Bein' dead is part of my
job image. Like what I do.

DOC
Are you working for these people
here at the club?

Coy
I don't know. Maybe. It's where
I come to pick up my paycheck.

DOC
Where are you staying?

coy
House in Topanga Canyon. A band I
used to play for, The Boards. But
none of them know it's me.

DOC
How can they not know it's you?

coy
Even when I was alive, they didn't
know it was me, man. ‘The Sax
Player.’ The session guy. Plus,
over the years, there's been this
big turnover of personnel, like,
The Boards I played with have most
of them gone off by now and formed
other bands. Only one or two of
the old crew are left, and they're
suffering with heavy doper's
memory.

DOC
Story is you came to grief behind
some bad smack. You still into
that?

coy
No. God. No. I'm clean these
days. I spent my time
rehabilitating up --

DOC
It's okay. I can't hear too good.
And how can I talk about what I
don't hear?
41.

Coy is delicate now, sizing Doc up, looking around, words
get more whispery:

coy
The thing I wanted to see you
about... Just wondering if you

could check in on a couple of
people. A lady and a little girl.
See that they're okay -- and
without bringing me into it. It's
down in Torrance.

(hands him address)
Just see if they're still livin'
there. What's in the driveway.
Law enforcement in the picture,
any details you find interesting --

DOC
I'm on it.

coy
I can't pay you right now.

DOC
When you can. Unless maybe you're
one of those folks who believe
information is money, in which
case, I could ask you something?

coy
Bearing in mind that either I
don't know or it'll be my ass if I
tell you, what is it?

DOC
Ever heard of the Golden Fang?

Coy
Sure. It's a boat. A big
schooner, somebody said. Brings
stuff in and out of the country
but nobody wants to talk about
it...

DOC
Because?

coY turns and look out over his shoulder into the HARBOR.
It's foggy... DOC squints through stoned eyes... Coy
turns back to him:

coy
That was it.

DOC
How do you know?

coy
Saw it sail in. Got here the
same time I did tonight.
42.

DOC
I don't know what I just saw.

coy
Me neither. Fact, I don't even
want to know.

Doc blinks and like that... Coy's gone... Doc is left
standing alone, very confused, and paranoid.

30 EXT. BEACH/SAND DUNE - DAY 30

DOC looking through binoculars, SAUNCHO is here, over his
shoulder. They're looking at a THREE-MASTED SCHOONER,
GOLDEN FANG.

SAUNCHO
Meet the schooner Golden Fang, out
of Charlotte Amalie.

DOC
Where is that?

SAUNCHO
Virgin Islands.

DOC
Bermuda Triangle?

SAUNCHO
Close enough.

DOC
Sizable vessel.

SAUNCHO
She has a tendency to show up in
the middle of the night, no
running lights, no radio traffic.
See, the problem with this vessel
is trying to find out anything.
People back off, change the
subject, get creepy and head for
the toilet, never to reappear...
the owners are listed as a
consortium in the Bahamas.

31 INT. FISH PLACE 31
Doc and Sauncho at a disgusting restaurant.
SAUNCHO
Her name isn't really the Golden

Fang.
(MORE)
43.

SAUNCHO (CONT'D)
Her original name was Preserved
after her miraculous escape in
1917 from a tremendous
nitroglycerin explosion in Halifax
Harbor which blew away most
everything else in it, shipping
and souls. After World War II she
was bought by Burke Stodger.

DOC
Burke Stodger, Burke Stodger.
Burke Stodger, the actor? .45
Caliber Kiss Off -- Burke Stodger?

Sauncho motions to the wall -- a few 8x10 headshots of
film stars who have visited the Fish Place -- one of them
is BURKE STODGER from his younger days in BLACK AND WHITE
HEADSHOT...

SAUNCHO
... Burke Stodger got blacklisted
for his politics, branded a
communist and was forced to take
the boat and split the country.
Which is where the Bermuda
Triangle comes in.....

Sauncho hushes up as the waitress arrives...

SAUNCHO
Ordinarily I'd have the Admiral’s
Luau -- but today I'll have the
house anchovy loaf to start and
the devil-ray filet. Can I get
that deep fried in beer batter?

DOC
I'll have the jellyfish teriyaki
croquettes and the eel trovatore.

SAUNCHO
And two tequila Zombies.

Waitress leaves, Sauncho back to whispers:

SAUNCHO
«+. so Burke's blacklisted, splits
town on the boat... but somewhere

between San Pedro and Papeete, the
ship disappears, till one day, a
couple years later, boat and owner
suddenly reappear -- Preserved

in the opposite ocean, off Cuba,
and Burke Stodger on the front
page of Daily Variety in an
article reporting his return in a
big budget major studio project
called Commie Confidential. He
followed that up with Squeal,
Pinko, Squeal and I Was A Red Dope
Fiend.
44,

DOC
Soooo00000000 Burke's working
again?

SAUNCHO

And his politics have miraculously
changed. It's wrecking my
appetite just talking about what's
happened to this great ship --
they removed any traces of soul
she once had...

DOC
You're emotionally involved? With
a boat?

SAUNCHO

Not just a boat, Doc. Something
much more. I know why I'm so
interested, but why are you?

DOC
Some story I heard the other
night. Maybe some kind of
smuggling angle?

SAUNCHO
As attorney and client, this story
you heard -- it didn't happen to

include Mickey Wolfmann?

DOC
Not so far, why?

SAUNCHO
According to scuttlebutt, shortly
before his disappearance --
everybody's favorite developer was
observed going onboard the Golden
Fang. What we call a three-hour
tour and back again...

DOC
Was he accompanied by his lovely
companion?

SAUNCHO
«+. Who?

DOC

My ex-old Shasta Fay?

SAUNCHO
Thought you were done with all
that sad bullshit.

DOC
«+. Everybody make it back? No
one pushed overboard? Nothin'
like that?

SAUNCHO
Let's order you a boilermaker to
go with the Zombie and you can
start the whole sordid thing over

again...
DOC

Just asking... anything else?
SAUNCHO

Word swirling around some of my
friends at the Department of
Justice says that maybe Mickey
Wolfmann's not as missing as we
think?

DOC
Like gone but not gone?

SAUNCHO
A rumor that these guys are trying
to broker a Vegas deal with
Wolfmann...

DOC
Doesn't compute. Say again.
Vegas. Wolfmann.

SAUNCHO
It's FBI stuff. That's what they
do in Vegas... apparently Wolfmann

owned some property they wouldn't
mind having...

The drinks arrive.

SAUNCHO
Mmmmmmmmmm. +All this good eatin'.

INT. DOC'S PLACE - NIGHT 37

DOC is on the couch, pretty stoned, watching PRESIDENT
NIXON on TV at a Republican rally for a group known as
VIGILANT CALIFORNIA. Nixon stands in front of a huge
banner promoting them. A LONG-HAIRED GUY IN THE CROWD AT
THE RALLY STARTS HECKLING NIXON... SCREAMING AND YELLING.

WILD-EYED GUY (V.0.)
(on TV)
HEY, NIXON! TRICKY DICK! FUCK
YOU! FUCK EVERYBODY AND THE FIRST
FUCKIN’ FAMILY! FUCK THE DOG!
38

PENNY comes out of the bedroom, naked and smoking a
joint, sees the TV and says...

PENNY

Hey... it's Chucky!
DOC

Who?
NIXON (V.O.)

(on TV)
Better get him to a hippie drug
clinic!
SECRET SERVICE come over and get him. DOC realizes that

this WILD-EYED GUY is actually: COY HARLINGEN.

PENNY
That's no hippie! That's Chucky!

DOC
Who is it? A friend of yours?

PENNY
Everybody knows him. When he's
not hanging out at the Hall of
Justice, he's at the Glass House.

DOC
A snitch?

PENNY
Informant, please.

DOC
And why's he yelling at Nixon
like that again?

PENNY
Now he's been on TV. Instant and
wide credibility. The police can
infiltrate him into any group they
want.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOPANGA CANYON HOUSE - AFTERNOON 38

DOC, disguised as a REPORTER (ponytail, fedora hat, tape
recorder) and DENIS as a PHOTOGRAPHER pull up to the
house in Topanga Canyon where The Boards are staying. As
they enter the huge mansion, a couple sexy young house
GROUPIES come forward with leis and beads and put them
around Doc and Denis...

INSIDE

Doc walks through the party...

ANOTHER ANGLE 39
SMEDLEY (Spotted Dick band member) and his KEYBOARD.
Doc interviews him, like he's a reporter...

SMEDLEY
This is Fiona...

DOC
What do you and Fiona talk about?

SMEDLEY
Oh, what you'd expect.
Association football, the war in
Southeast Asia, where one can
score, that sort of thing.

DOC
And how's Fiona enjoying it here
in Southern California?

SMEDLEY
Loves everything but the paranoia,
man.

DOC

Paranoia, really?

SMEDLEY
This house...

SMEDLEY grows quiet as he notices road manager-types who
may or may not be working undercover come near --
ANGLE - DOC 40

Doc lurks around a hallway and runs into: JADE.

DOC
What, you again?
JADE
I drove up with Bambi -- she heard

Spotted Dick were staying here --

DOC
She's keen on the Dick, huh?

JADE
Tuneful and poetic. English, I
guess. I had to come along to try
and keep her out of trouble.

DOC
If anybody asks, I'm a rock and
roll reporter, okay?
41

42

48.

JADE
I'll tell them about your Pat
Boone cover article.

DOC
Have you seen the guy I was
talking to at Club Asiatique the
other night?

JADE
Yeah, he's here. Try the
rehearsal rooms upstairs...

REHEARSAL STUDIO 41

DOC makes his way to a SMALL REHEARSAL STUDIO UPSTAIRS.
He steps inside and sees: COY, doing some recording with
his SAXOPHONE... “Donna Lee."

DOC
Howdy! It's me again! Remember
that chore you wanted me to do?

COY signals his thumb to a cloister of RECORDING
EQUIPMENT.

coy
What was the, uh, make and model
you looked at again?

DOC
«+. You were asking about a older-
type VW, flowers and bluebirds and
hearts on it?

coy
No new replacement parts?
DOC
None I could see.
coy
Street legal? No hassles with
registration?
DOC

Seemed that way.

coy
Well, thanks for looking into
that, you know, I just wondered
the way people do. I'll be in
touch.

LIVING ROOM AREA 42

DOC looks in another room, sees a big TEEPEE. He steps
inside and suddenly, Coy is with him:
49,

coy
So you got to see Hope?

DOC
For a minute. She's okay. And it
looks like she's been staying
clean, too.

coy
How'd she do it?

DOC
I don't know. She's back teaching
is all she said. Public health,
drug awareness, something like

that.

coy
Where?

DOC
I don't know.

coy

-- You're not gonna tell me where?

DOC
Not even if I knew.

coy
What -- you really think that I
would ever start giving either of
them shit?

DOC
I don't do matrimonials. I have a
terrible history of putting in,
and it's never ended well.

coy
Don't matter. No way I can ever
go back to them.

DOC
You can't go back, because if you
did...?

coy

It would be my ass and my
family's, too. This is like a
gang. Once you're in, you're in

for life.

DOC
I'm not asking you to give away
any secrets... But I think I just

saw you on the tube at a rally for
Nixon?
50.

coy
And your question is, is am I
really one of them screamin' right-
wing nutcases?

DOC
Somethin' like that.
coy
I just wanted to get clean... and

I thought it was something to do
for my country. Stupid as it
sounds. They saw something in me
I didn't see. These people were
the only ones who were offering me
that. It looked like an easy
call... But what they really want
is to control the membership by
making us feel we're never
patriotic enough. My country
right or wrong, with Vietnam going
on? That's just fuckin' crazy.
Suppose your mom was using smack.

DOC
My, uh...
coy
You wouldn't at least say
something?
DOC
Wait, so the U.S. is somebody's
mom, you're sayin'?... and she's
strung out on... what, exactly?
coy

On sending kids off to die in
jungles for no reason. Something
wrong and suicidal that she can't
stop.

DOC
«+. Uhhhhhh... and Vigilant
California, or whoever you're
workin' for, won't buy that?

coy
I never got a chance to bring it
up. Look at me around here. I'm
lower than a groupie, fetching
weed, opening beers, making sure
there's only aqua jelly beans in
the giant punch bowl in the
parlor.

DOC
I do get the feeling you'd rather
be someplace else --
51.

coy
Back where I was would be nice,
but it's too late --

DOC
Short of actual marriage
counseling, if I did just run a
fast check and happened to find
some angle you maybe haven't
thought of with this --

coy
Nothing personal, man. But
there's too much you haven't
thought of. You want to run your
check, I can't stop you.

DOC
I can dig you're tryin' to chase
me off this, but look, whatever it
is you're caught inside, I'm still
out here, on the outside of it. I
can move in ways you may not be

able to...
coy
The baby? How'd she look?
DOC
A sweetie pie.
coy
Any sign of them little kid blues?
DOC
I couldn't say...
coy
«+. I've really blown this solo,
man.
DOC

The original call from these
people, where did it come from?

coy
It's like bein' stuck with a
borrowed horn.

DOC
Just give me a glimpse here: Who
set you up with these people?

coy
When I first started snitching, I
realized how often people ask
questions they already know the
answers to -- but they just want
to hear it from another voice,
like outside their head --
43

44

52.

DOC
Help me out...

coy
You'd better find Shasta Fay.

Doc blinks and Coy disappears again --

DOC
Now... what the fuck?

IN ANOTHER PART OF THE HOUSE 43
DENIS has made his way into the kitchen... Denis sees Coy
drift into the dining room to get something to eat... so

he lifts his camera and snaps. Which sets off a bunch of
people moving towards them: Doc runs into Jade:

JADE
Doc, can I get a ride, this place
is freakin' me out --

They head out of the house --

CUT TO:

EXT. TOPANGA CANYON - NIGHT 44

A SINISTER-LOOKING WOODIE WITH BLACKED OUT WINDOWS IS
FOLLOWING THEM... DOC drives faster and faster through
the treacherous canyon road...

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
As if things weren't peculiar
enough, Doc was managing to put
himself on a full-scale paranoid
trip about Shasta...

JADE and DENIS are in the backseat and start to strike up
a conversation as Denis is rolling a joint...

DENIS
And what's, like, your name?
JADE
Ashley... do you eat pussy, by the

way?

CLOSEUP - DOC

driving, paranoid, bad driver, lights in rearview mirror.
53.

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
«+. and how she must have been
using, all the time she and Doc
were together, maybe since before
they'd met, a devoted junkie
taking every chance she could to
slip out into the fine breezy
nights and go someplace they'd've
been looking after her outfit for
her so she wouldn't have to hide
it at home from Doc... just to be
back for a while among the junkie
fellowship, to have a break from
this hopeless stooge she was
already planning to split on and
so forth.

JADE 45

gets out of the car --

JADE
Thanks for the lift, boys.
DOC
Hey, Ashley?
JADE
Yeah?
DOC
I thought you said your name was
Jade?
JADE

That's just my nom du Chick
Planet Massage.

DOC
Alrighty, then -- while we're just
talking here, is there anything
else you wanna tell me about this
Golden Fang?

JADE
They're an Indochinese heroin
cartel. A vertical package. They
grow it, bring it in, step on it,
run stateside networks of local
street dealers and take a separate
percentage off of each operation.

DOC
So... you're dealing smack?

JADE
No, but they use Chick Planet as a
front to launder money. Should I
have told you this earlier?
54.

DOC
Maybe not.

JADE

See you around.

(ALTERNATE )
«+. Just be advised boys, you'll
want to watch your step, ‘cause
what I am is, is like a small-
diameter pearl of the Orient
rolling around on the floor of
late capitalism -- lowlifes of all
income levels may step on me now
and then but if they do -- it'll
be them who slip and fall and ona
good day break their ass, while
the ol' pearl herself just goes a-
rollin'. Thanks for the lift.

CUT TO:

46 EXT./INT. PARKER CENTER- DAY 46

Doc walks up and in the building. Like being on another
planet.

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
All this strange alternate cop
history and cop politics -- cop
dynasties, cop heroes and
evildoers, saintly cops and psycho
cops, cops too stupid to live and
cops too smart for their own good
-- insulated by secret loyalties
and codes of silence from the
world they'd all been given to
control...

47 INT. HOMICIDE ROOM 47

DOC comes into HOMICIDE ROOM. BIGFOOT is here, eating a
frozen banana.

BIGFOOT
I hope this will not be another of
those unabridged paranoid hippie
monologues I seem obliged to sit

through.

DOC
What if someone died but was
resurrected?

BIGFOOT

Not at first glance a matter for
Homicide.
48

49

55.

DOC
So - who around here handles
resurrections?

BIGFOOT

Bunco squad, usually.

DOC
Does that mean LAPD officially
believes that every return from
the dead is some kind of con?

BIGFOOT
Not always. Could be a mistaken
or false I.D. type of problem.

DOC
But not --

BIGFOOT
You're dead, you're dead. Are we
talking philosophy?

ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER 48

Doc and Bigfoot sitting together, Doc catching him up to
speed on Coy's case. DOC gives him a PHOTO OF COY: It's
like The Last Supper, Coy as Jesus grabbing food from
table.

BIGFOOT
Just remind me why I give a shit
again?

DOC

He's worked for the Department as
a snitch, he oughta be in your

file...
BIGFOOT looks at Doc, then the picture: “How much does
Doc know?"
BIGFOOT
Alright, I'll look into it
personally.

He motions down a back corridor...
BIGFOOT
Just want to look in the freezer a
minute... come with me.

CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDOR/UTILITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 49

Bigfoot leads Doc down a hall and into a room with a
CORPSE-SIZE PROFESSIONAL FREEZER.
56.

Bigfoot opens it up: INSIDE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED FROZEN
CHOCOLATE COVERED BANANAS.

BIGFOOT
I'm down to a dozen a day now.
The therapist says I've made
amazing progress. Please, dig in,
feel free. I'm told I have to
share.

He puts the FROZEN BANANAS in the PNEUMATIC TUBE
DISPENSER, sending chocolate frozen bananas hurling
around Parker Center...

DOC
Certainly a lot of these in here.
Is the Department picking up the
tab?

Bigfoot's FACE TURNS AND THE MOLECULES COMPLETELY CHANGE
AS HE SEES SOMETHING OVER DOC'S SHOULDER... DOC looks
scared stiff... realizes Bigfoot's looking past him, Doc
turns --

DOWN THE CORRIDOR -—

A FEW OFFICERS, DETECTIVES, VICE SQUAD MEMBERS ARE SAYING
SOME KIND WORDS, SHAKING HANDS, LAUGHING WITH A STRANGE
LITTLE MAN: ADRIAN PRUSSIA. Everyone's all smiles as
they UN-CUFF ADRIAN...

DOC
Is that Adrian Prussia? I
remember him from my skip tracing
days... he's the one with the
bat... he beat up an old lady with
a baseball bat. And why's he... I
mean... why's he shaking hands and
smiling and kissing babies with
the Vice Squad boys again? Which
part did I miss? And why's he
walking this way???

ADRIAN walks over.

ADRIAN
This you're new partner, Bigfoot?
BIGFOOT
Here, Adrian... have a banana.
Bend over and I'll stick it in for
you.
ADRIAN

Fuck you. And fuck your banana.
Adrian exits. Bigfoot to Doc...

DOC
You guys go back, huh?
50

51

57.

BIGFOOT
Where do you think Mickey Wolfmann
is, Doc?

DOC
Now that's a good question. (You

try Las Vegas yet?)

BIGFOOT
And where is that love of your
life Shasta Fay Hepworth?

DOC
Play nice. (Mighty snotty,
Bigfoot.)

BIGFOOT
And how much could she have really
meant to him -- or him to her that
he could just let this all get
so fucked up?

DOC
Best question yet. (Is this
multiple choice?)

BIGFOOT
There's places you don't want to
go, Doc -- better get back to the
beach, you smell like a patchouli

factory.
CUT TO:
EXT./INT. DOC’S OFFICE - NIGHT 50
Doc walks the long corridor towards his office...
DOC 51

walks into his office, is deep in thought, locks the door
double and triple lock turns and SCREAMS AT THE SIGHT OF
A SEXY YOUNG BIKER GIRL: CLANCY CHARLOCK.

DOC
AHHHAHAHAHHA!!!! COOTIE FOOD!!

CLANCY
Remains to be seen...

DOC
WHO ARE YOU?!??

CLANCY
Clancy Charlock.

DOC
Glen Charlock’s?
CLANCY
Sister.

DOC
I’m sorry about your brother...

CLANCY
Glen was a shit and bound to have

58.

his series canceled sometime. But
that don’t keep me from wanting to

know who his killer is.

DOC
You talk to the police?

CLANCY

They talked to me. Some smart-ass

named Bjornsen. Can’t say it was
encouraging. But I guess he’s a

fan of yours... Would you mind not

staring at my tits like that?

DOC
Sorry -- I was just reading your
T-shirt. So now... you say...
Lieutenant Bjornsen referred you
to me?

CLANCY
He sounded a lot more concerned
with Mickey Wolfmann's
disappearance than Glen's murder,
which I guess is no big surprise.
Is that a joint? Can I smoke it?

DOC pulls out a freshly rolled one.

DOC
Here's a new one.../Please...

She lights it and smokes half of it down in
before passing it back to Doc...

DOC
The theory downtown is that your
brother tried to prevent whoever
it was from putting the snatch on
Mickey and got shot for doing his
job.

CLANCY
Way too sentimental.

DOC
Then maybe he saw something he
shouldn't have.

CLANCY
That's how Boris has it figured
to.

one suck
59.

DOC
Who's that?

CLANCY
Another member of Mickey's muscle
patrol. They've all dropped out
of sight, but last night, Boris
called me late. We have some
history. Right now, he's scared
shitless.

DOC
What of?

CLANCY
He said Mickey was in the deepest
shit you could get in all because
of this idea that came to him.

DOC
Which was?

CLANCY
All the money he ever made -- he
was working on a way just to give
it back.

DOC
Can I still get my name on the
list?

CLANCY

That's what I said!

DOC
Why, but why would he want to?

CLANCY
Wouldn't be the first rich guy
on a guilt trip lately. He was
doing a lot of acid and peyote and
maybe it just got to a point...
you must've seen that happen.

DOC
Once or twice, but it's more
like calling in sick for a couple
days, breakin' up with your old
lady, nothing on that scale.

CLANCY
He said he felt bad about making
people pay for shelter -- that all
along he should have realized it
should've been for free --

DOC
He told him that?
60.

CLANCY
Boris heard him say it... he
wanted to build a big place out in
the desert where anybody could

come and live for free -- called
Arrepentimiento.

DOC
Yeah, okay, and what's that mean
again?

CLANCY

Spanish for ‘sorry about that.’
The idea was if there was an open

unit -- it was yours for free...
anyone from anywhere can have
shelter... are you gonna keep

holding on to that joint or are
you gonna marry it?

DOC
And what about Mickey's ladies?
Any of them object to his big
giveaway?

CLANCY
Only one I've heard Boris say
anything about is Shasta -- the
one's gone missing.

DOC
What'd he say?

CLANCY
Said Shasta was the only one that
ever made any sense around there --
she was nervous about Mickey
givin' away all his money -- which
I guess caused some problems
because it made him think that's
all she was worried about was her
meal ticket -- which I guess was
really crazy cause she was in love
with him. Deeply in love...

DOC
Shasta and I lived for a short
while together and I can't say for
sure how deep it went. How she
really felt about me.

CLANCY
Well, I hope this ain't a bummer
for you to be hearin’...

DOC
Clancy, I only look like an evil
motherfucker... secretly, I'm as

sentimental as any ex-old man.
52

61.

CLANCY
You are a pretty dangerous hombre,
I can see that... but, as one
who's been down this particular
exit ramp -- you can only cruise
the boulevards of regret so far,
and then you've got to get back up
onto the freeway again.

DOC
Who else does he think was worried
about Mickey's big giveaway?
Business partners? The wife?

CLANCY
That cop friend of yours kept
showing up at the house all the
time warning Mickey...

DOC
Bigfoot? So he warned Mickey to
what?

CLANCY
I don't know. (Mickey didn't
listen to advice... maybe he said
don't give away all your money?
Stop doing peyote? Stop doing
acid? You're the detective.)

CUT TO:

EXT. DOC'S OFFICE - NIGHT 52

Clancy and Doc step out of the office. She has TWO
BIKERS waiting for her...

After Clancy. Driving to get postcard... NO SORTILEGE.

EXT. DOC'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 53

Doc walks up to his place... a FEW SHADOWS AND MOVEMENTS
AROUND click him into a paranoia alert... He sees on the
doorsill a POSTCARD... He carefully picks it up, looks it
over... it's from some place deep in the Pacific Ocean.

SHASTA (V.O.)
I wish you could see these waves.
It's one more of these places a
voice from somewhere else tells
you you have to be. Remember the
day with the Ouija board? I miss
those days and I miss you. I wish
so many things could be

different... Nothing was supposed
to happen this way, Doc, I'm
sorry...
CUT TO:
INT. DOC'S APARTMENT 54

He comes in, places the postcard down and lights a joint,

FLASHBACK - INT. SORTILEGE'S HOUSE 55

DOC and SHASTA with SORTILEGE and a OUIJA BOARD.

DOC
Hey! You think it knows where we

can score?

SORTILEGE
Easy as pie, just do it all by
yourself.

DOC and SHASTA put their hands on it. The PLANCHETTE
TAKES OFF LIKE A ROCKET, SPELLING OUT AN ADDRESS AND A
PHONE NUMBER. They furiously write this down. DOC picks
up the phone and dials. It rings and a FEMALE VOICE

RECORDING ANSWERS:

FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
‘Howdy, dopers! We've got
whatever you need, and remember --
the sooner you get over here, the
more there'll be left for you.’

DOC
Who is this? Whom I talking to?
Hey! She just hung up.

SORTILEGE
Did you hear what she was
screaming at you: ‘Stay away! I
am a police trap!’ You see the
problem about Ouija boards --

DOC looks to SHASTA and they RUN OUT THE DOOR, IGNORING
SORTILEGE.

CUT TO:

EXT. SUNSET (NEAR VERMONT) 56

They arrive at the address in the rain. It's a HUGE,

DOC and SHASTA stuff for here.

CUT TO:

EXT. SUNSET (NEAR VERMONT) (PRESENT) 57

DOC walks over to the area where the vacant lot was...

the hole in ground is gone... and in its place, a
STRANGELY FUTURISTIC building. SMOOTH, NARROW, CONICAL --
A SIX-STORY-HIGH GOLDEN FANG.

DOC walks back down the street.. DENIS is in the car,
waiting for him...

DOC
Denis, I'm gonna look around for a
while, you want to wait in the car
or come in and cover my back?

DENIS
I was gonna go try and finda
pizza, if that's okay?

DOC
And you remember that this is a
stick, not automatic and so forth.

DENIS
Easy as pie, Doc.
CUT TO:
INT. GOLDEN FANG ENTERPRISES H.Q. - THAT MOMENT 58

It's quiet. Doc enters. A receptionist: XANDRA (Asian,
British, 20s) and a sign that reads: “Golden Fang
Enterprises/Corporate HQ.”

DOC
Hi, Xandra. This is the address
they told me at the Club Asiatique
in San Pedro? Just here to pick
up a package for the management?

XANDRA reaches for a telephone, punches some numbers,
murmurs into it. She hangs up.

XANDRA
Follow me.

She guides him down a hall...

She puts him in an empty office.

XANDRA
Dr. Blatnoyd will see you ina

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

DR. RUDY BLATNOYD (50s) enters, wearing an eggplant
velour double-breasted suit; high-energy. Blatnoyd flips
open a three-ring binder, looks it over, then looks up at
Doc:

BLATNOYD
So... you have some I.D., I
imagine?

Doc goes into his wallet, pulls out a business card from
a Chinese head shop.

BLATNOYD
I can't read this... it's in
some... Oriental... what is this,
Chinese?

DOC
Well... I figured that you, being
Chinese.

BLATNOYD
What? What are you talking about?

DOC
The... the Golden Fang...?

BLATNOYD
It's a syndicate. Most of us
happen to be dentists. A
syndicate of dentists. Set up
long ago for tax purposes, all
legit... Wait, where did you tell
Xandra you were from again?

DOC
-+. Uh...

BLATNOYD
Why, you're another one of those
hippie dopefiends, aren't you? My
goodness! Here for a little
perking up, I'll bet --

He brings out a tall CYLINDER of BROWN GLASS.
60

61

66.

BLATNOYD
Dig it! Just in from Darmstadt,
lab quality, maybe I'll even have
some with you --

He dumps the PHARMACEUTICAL COCAINE out on the table,
arranges some lines, offers some to DOC.

DOC
I try not to do dope I can't pay
for, ‘s what it is.

BLATNOYD
Wooooo! No worries. It's on the
house.

DOC
Well, just to be sociable, I
guess...

XANDRA enters, seductively:

XANDRA
Doctor? I think there's a problem
with the couch in your office.

Blatnoyd grabs the cylinder, runs after Xandra, unzipping
his pants as he goes... DOC does some snooping... He goes

INT. HUGE ROOM - THAT MOMENT 60

It's a pristine, long and narrow DENTAL OPERATION ROOM.
ROWS OF DENTIST CHAIRS, EQUIPMENT ETC. A few chairs are
occupied by clients (mostly hippie-types, cleaned up)
There are DOCTORS and SEXY DENTAL ASSISTANTS wearing
surgical masks. Some of them look up, see DOC, then go
back to their patients. Doc takes this all in...

Doc comes back in...

JAPONICA
Hi, Dr. Rudy... I'm back...

DOC
You're not Dr. Rudy...

JAPONICA
You're not Dr. Rudy...

A young girl has entered Blatnoyd's office: JAPONICA
FENWAY (20). Doc recognizes her.

That's at Japonica, ain't it?
Japonica Fenway? Imagine meeting
you here...

Doc walks slowly towards Japonica...

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
This was not a moment he'd been
either dreading or hoping for,
though now and then somebody would
remind him of the ancient American
Indian belief that if you save
somebody's life, you are
responsible for them from then on,
forever, and he would wonder if
any of that applied to his history

with Japonica here... (more??)
DOC

So... what have you been up to?
JAPONICA

Oh. Escaping mostly? There's
this, like, place my parents keep
sending me to?

DOC
Escaping? Escaping what?

JAPONICA

DENIS

XANDRA
No, no, no, where are you going?
Come back here...!

Denis enters into Blatnoyd's office --

DENIS
Hey, man... your ride's in a body
shop.

DOC

What is it this time?

DENIS
I sort of mashed the front end. I
was looking at these chicks out
on Little Santa Monica --

XANDRA
I told you you couldn't come up
here!
(to Japonica)
Oh. How lovely. Smile
Maintenance Chick.

BLATNOYD
Miss Fenway may seem a little
psychotic today --

DENIS
Groovy.

BLATNOYD
What?

BLATNOYD

It's not 'groovy' to be insane.
Japonica here has been
institutionalized for it.

Let's go, Denis, we gotta figure
out a way to catch a bus back to

the beach.

JAPONICA
If you need a ride, I'm heading
that way --

DOC

Cop-friendly? Everything cool
with your ride, Japonica? Brake
lights, license plates, so forth?

JAPONICA
A-okay.

BLATNOYD
Mind if I tag along with you

Yes, yes. Okay. That's a good

have some lights working seeing's
how Beverly Hills cops are known
to lurk uphill on these different
cross streets? Just waiting for
minor violations like lights to
pop folks on?

BLATNOYD
Everything all right, baby?
Um, Japonica, dear? That was a
red light?

JAPONICA
I don't think so... I think that
was one of it's eyes.

DOC
Oh, well, yes, we can sure dig
that, Japonica, but then again --

BLATNOYD
No, no, there's no ‘it’ watching
you! Those are not ‘eyes,’ those
are warnings to come to a full
stop and wait till the light turns
green, don't you remember learning
that in school?

POLICE LIGHTS.

CUT TO:

EXT./INT. STREET - MERCEDES - NIGHT 66

They've been pulled over by the POLICE. Doc tries to
calm everyone, etc... TWO ROOKIE COPS walk up to the car
looking cautious and careful... GUNS RAISED and SHAKING
VISIBLY... nervous as they approach the car.

JAPONICA
Are you the Great Beast?

BLATNOYD
No no no, that's a policeman,
Japonica, who only wants to make
sure you're all right.

COP
You know you were driving without
your headlights, miss?

JAPONICA
But I can see in the dark.

BLATNOYD
Her sister went into labor an hour
ago and Miss Fenway promised she'd
be there in time to see the baby
born, so she might've been a
little inattentive back there.

COP
That case, maybe somebody else
ought to be driving. And we'll
need everybody's I.D.s, too.

DOC
Sure thing. What's it about,
officer?

COP

Every gathering of three or more
civilians is now defined as a
potential cult --

DENIS
What!? Charlie Manson again?

NEXT COP
(to Cop)
Did you hear that? He called him
Charlie!

COP
Shush -- Criteria including
references to the book of
Revelation, males with shoulder-
length hair or longer and
endangerment through automotive
absentmindedness, all of which you
folks have been exhibiting.

DENIS
Yeah, but we're in a Mercedes and
it's only painted one color!

DOC
Denis --

DOC notices that both COPS are very subtly SHAKING.

COP
We'll hand this all in, Mr.
Sportello, and unless there's
wants or warrants we don't know
about, you won't hear any more on
this...

EXT. BEL AIR MANSION - NIGHT 67
They've pulled up out front of a massive Bel Air home with

a GATE AND A MOAT. BLATNOYD gets his BAG, climbs out of

BLATNOYD
Evening, Henrich.

BLATNOYD

JAPONICA

I was only doing my job.

JAPONICA

TARIQ
Hey, Doctor Sportello, my man.
This is all right, isn't it?

DOC closes the door, and looks at Petunia:

Small arms... and some bazookas.

TARIQ
Warriors Against The Man Black
Armed Militia. Glen said he had

He's out to a dinner with Clancy and Tarig, who are both
in the bathroom. THOMAS JEFFERSON's face is on a NICKEL
emblem all over this restaurant. THOMAS JEFFERSON
appears, sitting in a booth next to DOC, drinking coffee,
says:

DOC
(You look familiar -- are you the
guy on the nickel?)

THOMAS JEFFERSON
Thomas Jefferson. So. Guns and
Opium. The Golden Fang not only
traffic in enslavement, they
peddle the implements of
liberation as well.

DOC
Yeah... but as a founding father,
don't you get freaked out a little
with this revolution talk?

THOMAS JEFFERSON
The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time with
the blood of patriots and tyrants.
It is its natural manure.

DOC
Yeah, and what about when the
patriots and tyrants turn out to
be the same people?

THOMAS JEFFERSON
As long as they bleed is the
thing.

Doc deep in thought...

THOMAS JEFFERSON
A nickel for your thoughts...

DOC
Glen Charlock... If Glen was tight
with the Golden Fang, could they
be the ones who took him out? Is
he just another Rudy Blatnoyd, DDS
who touched some acupressure point
on the mysterious body of the
Golden Fang so uncomfortably he
had to be dealt with?
76.

THOMAS JEFFERSON
Nobody trusted Glen -- the Aryan
Brotherhood had him shitlisted
as a traitor to his race, the
Vigilant California was more than
eager to help -- and the raid on
Channel View Estates was a cover
for the hit on Glen --

DOC
And so Mickey Wolfmann...?

THOMAS JEFFERSON
Mickey was a witness -- he walked
in on something he shouldn't have
the V.C. commandoes hustled him
off -- Then the Feds found out,
here's an acid-head billionaire
ready to give away all his money --
and of course, they had their own
ideas on how to spend it. As long
time associates of the Golden Fang
by way of scag-related activities,
they got Mickey programmed into
Ojai for a little brain work --

DOC
Wait, wait, wait -- how do you
know all this?

THOMAS JEFFERSON
I'm on the nickel. I'm
everywhere. I see everything.

Every time a hippie puts his hand
out for loose change -- there I
am.

DOC
When you put it that way...

THOMAS JEFFERSON
Do you detect a common thread
here, Lawrence?

I can trust any of these people?

Excellent -- and what, if
anything, are you gonna do about
it?

crazed hippies.

BIGFOOT
You want the truth?
DOC
Um. No?
BIGFOOT

Well, here it is anyway: Right
now everyone is really scared.

DOC
Who? You? Me?

BIGFOOT
Odd, that fear should be running
the town again as in days of old,
like the Hollywood blacklist you
don't remember and the Watts
rioting you do —- it spreads, like
blood in a swimming pool, till it
occupies all the volume of the
day. And then maybe some playful
soul shows up with a bucketful of
piranhas, dumps them in the pool,
and right away they can taste the
blood. They swim around looking
for what's bleeding, but getting
more and more crazy, till the
craziness reaches a point. Which
is when they begin to feed on each
other.

BIGFOOT takes a BIG BITE.

BIGFOOT

face of it, just one more O.D.,

BIGFOOT
Puck Beaverton! Excellent choice.
One of Mickey Wolfmann's
bodyguards.

DOC
Interesting fellow, I hear...

BIGFOOT
Sheriff's people happen to run
into him at the Venice home of the
very dealer who sold Coy Harlingen
the smack that killed him.

DOC
So what was Puck doing at Coy's
dealer's place?

BIGFOOT
The interesting thing about this
overdose is that Leonard James
Loosemeat, AKA El Drano, was known
for this three-percent product...
but the report says what killed
him was Pure China White No. 4...

DOC
Like the kind you'd get from the
whole-seller? Like whoever's
bringing it in?

BIGFOOT
I seem to recall that some years
ago, just before he went into
Folsom, Beaverton used to work for
your best friend and loan shark
Adrian Prussia...

DOC
Your best friend.

BIGFOOT
And this dealer El Drano also
happened to be one of Prussia's
steady customers. Maybe Puck was
there on Adrian's behalf?
What do you think?

Pancakes aren't quite as good as

Didn't get enough of that from

BIGFOOT
You probably imagine I have a lot

Who could blame you for thinking
that... The reality, however... No
Cielo Drive for Bigfoot. No TV
movie rights or book deals for
Bigfoot... even the extra work is
drying up... God Help Us All.

Bigfoot is shaking his head slowly, Doc doesn't know how
to deal with this...

Okay, Bigfoot...

DOC writes something on a napkin...

DOC
It was dark, windy roads, couldn't
make it back there if I tried in
broad daylight --

He slides the napkin to him.

DOC
That's the address where we
dropped Dr. Rudy. It was about
eleven.

BIGFOOT
That's just where we found him.
This helps with the chronology.
Hair and drug issues
notwithstanding, I think you're
being very professional about
this...

DOC
Don't get sentimental on me, man,
it fucks up your edge.

BIGFOOT
I can be even more emotionally
irresponsible than that.

BIGFOOT (CONT'D)
There are certain polygraph keys
on this case that if I told you
what they were, then the only ones
who'd know would be Homicide, the
killer and you.

DOC
Good thing you're not telling me.

BIGFOOT
Suppose I tell you anyway?

DOC
Why should you?

BIGFOOT
Just so we know where we're ‘at’
as you people say.

DOC
How about I put my fingers in my
ears and scream if you try and
tell me?

BIGFOOT
You won't do that.

DOC
Really? Why don't I?

BIGFOOT
Because you're one of the few
hippie potheads in this town that
appreciate the distinction between
childlike and childish.
Besides... it's right up your
alley -- we're officially calling
it a neck injury --

DOC PLUGS HIS EARS AND STARTS TO MAKE NOISES "blah, blah,
blah." BIGFOOT SMACKS HIS HANDS AWAY.

BIGFOOT
Dr. Blatnoyd had puncture wounds
on his throat, consistent with
bites from canines of a midsize
wild animal. That's what the
coroner found.

DOC
Well, now that's mighty weird,
Bigfoot. Because Rudy Blatnoyd
was one of the partners in a tax
dodge that calls itself the Golden
Fang Enterprises. I don't suppose
you had the SID test out those
neck punctures for gold or nothin'
like that?
83.

BIGFOOT
I shouldn't think there'd be much
trace. Gold is all but chemically
inactive, as you might have
learned in chemistry class if you
hadn't been ditching all the time
to score dope.

DOC

What happened to Locard's Exchange
Principle? Every contact leaves
traces? It would sure be ironic,
man, is all I'm saying, if it
turned out Blatnoyd was bit to
death by a golden fang. Or even
better, like two golden fangs.

BIGFOOT
I don't see why anything like that
would be material?

DOC
Because it's the fucking Golden
Fang.

BIGFOOT
The descendent's tax shelter. So
what?

DOC
Not just a tax shelter, Bigfoot.
Maybe something much more, more
vast.

BIGFOOT
And this wouldn't be just more of
your paranoid hippie bullshit,
would it?

DOC
And have the lab look for traces
of copper. Not the kind that goes
stumbling all over the crime scene
contaminating evidence -- more
like copper, the metal? See, gold
teeth are never pure gold,
dentists like to alloy it with
copper? If you hadn't ditched
forensics class to go steal
hubcaps to plant on some
innocent hippie, you might have
known that.

Doc gets up and leaves.

BEAVERTON... leading the group of CHANTERS IN ROBES...

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
It was occurring to Doc now
something someone said once about
vertical integration... that if
the Golden Fang can get its
customers strung out, why not turn
around and sell them a program to
help kick? Get them coming and
going, twice as much revenue and
no worries about new customers...
as long as American life was
something to be escaped from, the
cartel could always be sure of a
bottomless pool of new customers.

Doc lights a joint... he holds it for her to smoke...

Mickey... Mickey could have taught
all you swinging beach bums a
thing or two. He was just so

around my bare arm, steering me
blind down out of those bright
streets into some space where it
was dark and cool and you couldn't
smell any food, only alcohol --
they'd all be drinking, tables
full of them, in a room that could
have been any size, and they all
knew Mickey, they wanted, some of
them, to be Mickey... He might as
well have been bringing me in on a
leash. He kept me in those micro
minidresses, never allowed me to
wear anything underneath... just
offering me to whoever wanted to
stare. Or grab. Or sometimes he'd
fix me up with his friends. And
I'd have to do whatever they
wanted...

Why are you telling me all this?

She drapes herself over him and plays with her pussy.

SHASTA

Oh, I'm sorry, Doc. Do you want
me to stop? If my girlfriend had
run away to be the bought-and-sold
whore of some scumbag developer?
I'd just be so angry I don't know

Coy Harlingen. And he's clean.

He's been working as a snitch for
the LAPD, and I also saw him on
the tube working undercover for
this outfit called Vigilant
California... and you don't look
surprised enough, Shasta, he's
meant to be dead...

SHASTA
Then I guess that one's on my
ticket because it was me who
introduced him to Burke Stodger
and Burke who set him up with the
Viggies...

Burke Stodger?

We were neighbors in Hancock Park.

Alright -- whatever you meant to
do, Shasta, you ended up saving
Coy's life... now he's a snitch

for the LAPD and an undercover
agent for the Viggies and maybe
the Golden Fang -- the outfit,
not the boat -- and there's a few
stiffs so far that may or may not
be on his karmic ticket.

SHASTA
I should be saying ‘Coy's a big
boy and he can take care of
himself,’ but the only thing is I
don't think he can...

DOC
But whatever these people are
into, it ain't helping junkies get
back on the straight and narrow...
What did he think was gonna
happen? That cover story about
him being dead fell apart from the

happen when you got into your
whole P.I. trip?

if they paid him anything it'd be
half a lid or a small favor down
the line or maybe only just a
quick smile, long as it was real.
He began to run through the cash
customers he could remember,
starting with Crocker Fenway and
going on through studio
executives, stock market heroes of
the go-go years, remittance men
from far away who needed new pussy
or dope connections, rich old guys
with cute young wives and vice
versa... It was sure a piss-poor
record, not too different, after
all, he guessed, from interests
Coy had been working for. Forget
who -- what was he working for
anymore?

Everybody. Nobody. Does it

Alright, then: Correct me if I'm
mistaken, Bigfoot, but it's clear
to me that you're desperate to
have a word with Adrian Prussia
but can't let on, because
otherwise you're in deep shit with
powers unnamed -- so you're using
me instead -- have I got that more
or less right?

BIGFOOT
We're in sensitive territory here,
Sportello.

DOC
Well, somebody's gonna have to be
less sensitive for a minute and
just wipe off their chin and stand
up and deal with it. If there's
something you need, just come
on out and say it, how hard can
that be?

BIGFOOT
Pretty hard. Internal Affairs has
it all locked down.

DOC
Internal Affairs, what does
Internal Affairs have to do with
this?

BIGFOOT
Figure it out. Use what's left of

PENNY
Your friend’s partner...

Adrian's like the LAPD'S own
personal hitman, doing deeds
for them that they won't do
themselves...

DOC
And you know all this because...?

PENNY
Everyone does. State Attorney
General's office has been after
him for years but nobody can touch
him, partly because of this
interesting portfolio of
I0Us he has -- and that's always
enough to guarantee obedience.

DOC
Obedience to who?

PENNY
Commanders. Controllers. The
Department itself.

DOC
So someone inside the LAPD ordered
a hit on Bigfoot's partner?

PENNY
You think it's all some monolithic
fun fest down here, Doc? Nothing
to do all day but figure out new
ways to persecute you hippies?

So Adrian Prussia kills Bigfoot's
partner with the apparent
collaboration of elements within
the Department. Everybody knows
he did the deed but there's no
back channel outcries in the
paper, no vigilante revenge by
horrified fellow officers... No,
instead it's locked up tight for
the next thirty years, everybody
pretending it's another cop hero
fallen in the line of duty.
Forget about decency, or
respecting the memories of all the
real dead-cop heroes -- how can
people be that fuckin'
unprofessional?

not only as a what seemed to
be a personal loan shark for the
LAPD but moon-lit as their own
personal contract-killer -- doing
deeds for them that they couldn't
do themselves. Time after time,
he was pulled in, questioned,
arraigned, indicted, no matter --
somehow the cases never quite got
to trial, each being bargained
down in the interests of justice,
not to mention Adrian, who
invariably walked. And one of
those deeds appeared to be

I was just about to ask...

ENTER: PUCK BEAVERTON.

DOC
Howdy... Puck...

PUCK
Do I know you? I don't think I
do.

DOC

You look like somebody I ran
across once. My mistake.

PUCK
Your mistake.

ADRIAN
I have a busy day ahead. And I
know nothing of any of this.

PUCK sits at Adrian's desk and lights up A VERY LARGE
JOINT. He takes a hit, hands it over to Doc... Doc
notices PUCK wearing the same seashell necklace as
Shasta.

PUCK
It helps to have a bad memory
sometimes.....

(You didn't take my advice.)
So what can I help you with today?

DOC
I'm not sure. It's these cases
I'm working on... wondering if you
can shed some light on the winding
out at Channel View Estates with
Glen Charlock?

PUCK
Glen was the target all along.
That outfit he was runnin' guns
for didn't trust him anymore than
the Brotherhood who shitlisted him
for being a traitor to his race...

DOC
And what about Mickey Wolfmann...
112.

PUCK
Mickey just saw things he
shouldn't've. The boys in the
John Wayne outfits at Channel View
panicked and hustled him away --

then the Feds found out -- here's
an acid-head billionaire about to
give away all his money -- and, of

course, they had their own ideas
on how to spend it -- then they
programmed Mickey into Ojai for a
little brain work.

DOC
While we're just talking here --
did you know a detective named
Vincent Indelicato?

PUCK
Sure.
DOC
He met an untimely end -- any

ideas on what might have happened

PUCK
That was Adrian's. But I got to
pull the trigger...

DOC
«+. So who hired Adrian?

PUCK
It's cop-on-cop. Kind of a waste
of time to try and figure out...

DOC
... Why are you telling me all
this?

PUCK

After faithful attendance at Ninja
School in Boyle Heights, I have
become a master in the technique
known as false inhaling -- Acid
invites you through a door. PCP
opens the door, shoves you
through, slams it behind you

and locks it.

CUT TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
So commencing a classic and
memorable bummer...

113.

FADE IN:
INT. ROOM WITH WINDOWS 100
PCP TRIP.

There are two Docs, one on each side of a window in a
strange room.

poc #2
Hi.

DOC
You look just like you do in the
mirror.

poc #2

Groovy, because you don't look
like anything, in fact you're
invisible.

DOC
How can you see me?

poc #2
Because I'm lookin' right at you.
How come you ask so many
questions?

DOC
That's my job. Like, what I do.

poc #2
And perhaps you could get a
fuckin' haircut.

Docs turn and look at another window. There's a LARGE
BLACK-HOODED FIGURE WITH NO FACE.

GOLDEN FANG
As you may have already gathered --
I am the Golden Fang.

DOC
Like J. Edgar Hoover ‘is’ the FBI?

GOLDEN FANG
Not exactly... they have named
themselves after their worst fear.
I am the unthinkable vengeance
they turn to when one of them has
grown insupportably troublesome,
when all other sanctions have
failed.

DOC
Okay if I ask you something?
101

114.

GOLDEN FANG
About Dr. Blatnoyd. Dr. Blatnoyd
had a fatality for rogue profit
sharing activities of which his
coadjustors have taken a dim view.

DOC
So you... ate him up?

GOLDEN FANG
Sunk these into him --

Doc walks towards the Golden Fang, unable to do anything
else, it embraces him, and then EATS HIM ALIVE.

VOICE (0.S.)
He's freaking out...

DOC
Am not.

THERE'S A BLUR AND BLAST OF NOISE.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER 101

Doc comes out of the PCP fog and realizes he's been
HANDCUFFED to something. A bed? His gun is gone. He's
in deep shit.

He's able to peer out a window, he's on the second floor
of someplace with a warehouse. There's a CAR and a
MOTORCYCLE parked here... Puck is here ....

PUCK
Didn't know you were a weekend
warrior... I could have gone cheap
and used beer...

Special treat for you today, Doc.
We just got in a shipment of Pure
Number Four, not a white guy's
finger laid on it between the
Golden Triangle and your own
throbbin' vein, and there's worse
ways to be removed forever from
the major-pain-in-the-ass list.
Just let me step out here and get
you some. Don't go away now.

PUCK leaves... closes the door and locks it on the
outside... DOC, still in a PCP fog... STARTS PULLING THE
HANDCUFFS AROUND HIS WRIST THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE BED
POST... BREAKS IT.

LIKE AN ANIMAL HE TEARS THE BEDPOST APART.

He stands up on the chair, unscrews the light bulb. It's
pitch black. He waits.
115.

Puck opens the door... Doc whips the TOILET SEAT INTO HIS
FACE, then instantly smashes his foot down into Puck's
knee, bringing him down ....

A TRAY AND NEEDLE AND DOPE FALL TO THE FLOOR FROM PUCK'S
HANDS.

Doc takes the syringe from the floor, draws up the dope
and plunges it straight into Puck's jugular. He gets his
gun off Puck...

ADRIAN (0.S.)
Puck? Puckie?

DOC gets his GUN off PUCK'S DEAD BODY... and goes into
the hallway...

Adrian FIRES A SHOT THAT HITS A GONG BEHIND DOC -- THAT
RINGS OUT THROUGH THE REST OF THE SCENE.

Doc crouches behind a sofa, takes off his SANDAL and
throws it in the general direction of Adrian...

THIS DRAWS A SHOT FROM THE PATIO FROM ADRIAN. MUZZLE
FLASH. SMOKE... DOC trains his gun up...

Waits until he sees a DENSE PATCH OF MOVING SHADOW AND
FIRES OFF THREE ROUNDS... THERE'S A FAINT SOUND... AND
THERE'S NO SOUND AFTER THAT.

DOC WAITS UNTIL HE HEARS SOME INVISIBLE CRYING, BREATHING
IN THE ROOM SOMEWHERE:

DOC
That you, Adrian?

ADRIAN
I'm fuckin' lunch meat... oh,
shit...

DOC
Did I get you?

ADRIAN
You got me.

DOC
Fatal, I hope?

ADRIAN
Feels like it.

DOC

How can I know for sure?

ADRIAN
Maybe it'll be on news at 11,
asshole.
102

116.

DOC
Stay there. Try not to croak,
I'll call this in.

DOC gets into the KITCHEN AND CALLS AN AMBULANCE... BELOW
THE KITCHEN, HE HEARS MOVEMENT IN THE GARAGE. He creeps
down for a look, his pistol ready --

INSIDE THE GARAGE 102

It's BIGFOOT, who's unloading a bunch of HEROIN PACKS
from Adrian's Lincoln Continental and into a '65
Impala...

DOC
Bigfoot? Bigfoot, what the fuck?
BIGFOOT
Take care of ‘em okay, Doc?
DOC
You fuckin' lunatic. What is
this?
BIGFOOT

I'm in enough shit personally with
the captain and I've seen you on
the range... Nice work.

BIGFOOT puts the PARCEL into his car...

DOC
And that there, is that what I
think it is?

BIGFOOT
Well... it's only one. There's
more. Enough left for evidence.

DOC
Bigfoot, Bigfoot, I saw the movie,
man, and as I recall, that
character comes to a bad end.

BIGFOOT
I have obligations. Expenses.

DOC
This is the Golden Fang you're
about to rip off here, man. The
fully fuckin' weird outfit that
kills people --

BIGFOOT
That's according to your own
delusional system --

++. COPS AND STUFF START TO APPROACH IN THE DISTANT
B.G...
117.

BIGFOOT
Get in the car.

DOC
Fuck you, Bigfoot. You're a
fucking lunatic.

BIGFOOT
Get in the car.

Bigfoot gets Doc in the car.

CUT TO:
103 INT. BIGFOOT'S CAR (MOVING) 103
They're driving. DOC is silent, he looks out the window
that's open... wind blowing... Bigfoot's driving fast.
DOC
You're the LAPD's own Charlie
Manson... where are we going?
BIGFOOT
We had to impound your car again.
CUT TO:
104 EXT. CANOGA PARK TOW YARD - NIGHT 104

DOC is waiting out front of the tow yard... filling out
some paperwork...

Bigfoot is around back... he takes a KILO out of his
trunk and plants it in Doc's trunk...

Bigfoot brings Doc's car around, hands him keys...

DOC
Maybe I should take a small
commission for doing your dirty
work.

BIGFOOT
BUT THAT WOULD PUT YOU ON THE
FUCKING PAYROLL, WOULDN'T IT?????

Bigfoot gets in his car and drives off... Doc gets in his
car...
SORTILEGE
(whispers)
Doper's ESP, Doc... doper's ESP...

listen to it...

118.

INT. DENIS' APARTMENT - NIGHT 105
Doc has put the heroin into an CARDBOARD TV BOX. Denis
is here with Jade... they hide it in Denis' apartment.
DENIS
What is it?
JADE
A new TV!!!!
CUT TO:
INT. DOC'S PLACE - MORNING 106

It's the next morning. DOC is sitting on his couch.
He's waiting for the phone to ring, drinking coffee.

TV playing something... JOHN GARFIELD, He Ran All The
Way. THE PHONE RINGS.

DOC
Hello?

MALE
It's sure been a long time...

DOC
And your name was...

MALE
This is Crocker Fenway.

DOC
Japonica's dad? Japonica's gone
missing again?

CROCKER FENWAY (V.O.)
You have something that belongs to
some people I represent and they'd
like it back...

DOC
So not that it's any of my
business, but you're a principal
in all this?

CROCKER FENWAY (V.O.)
It's only because of me and our
small transaction over Japonica
that you're still alive...

DOC
Ever so grateful, sir... so what
do we do? I'd come to your house,
but don't you live behind a gate
in an already gated community?
107

119.

CROCKER FENWAY (V.O.)
You people do humor?

DOC
Well... more like practicality.
CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT (LOCATION TBD) - LATER 107

Doc is here, trying to keep it together. Crocker Fenway
(50s, white, lawyer) slides into a booth with him and
looks at him, orders a rum and Coke.

DOC
«+. How's the family?

CROCKER FENWAY
Mrs. Fenway still looks like the
Gross National Product and
Japonica is fine, if that's what
you mean.

DOC
Yeah, thought I saw old Japonica
at my doctor's office just the
other day... By the way, did you
ever run into a dentist named Rudy
Blatnoyd?

CROCKER FENWAY
Yes, I do seem to recall the name,
perished in a trampoline accident,

didn't he?

DOC
The LAPD's not sure it was an
accident.

CROCKER FENWAY
And you're wondering if I did it?
What possible motive would I have?
Just because the man preyed on an
emotionally vulnerable child, tore
her from the embrace of a loving
family, forced her to engage in
sexual practices that might appall
even a sophisticate like yourself
-- does that mean I'd have any
reason to see his miserable
pedophile career come to an end?
What a vindictive person you must
imagine me.

DOC
You know... I did suspect he was
fucking his receptionist.

(MORE)
120.

DOC (CONT'D)
But I mean, what dentist doesn't,
it's some oath they all have to
take in dentist school, and anyhow
that's a long way from strange and
weird sex. Isn't it?

CROCKER FENWAY
How about when he forced my little
girl to listen to original cast
albums of Broadway musicals while
he had his way with her?

DOC
Japonica's legal age now, isn't
she?

CROCKER FENWAY
In a father's eye, they're always
too young.

BEAT. They look at each other.

CROCKER FENWAY
To the matter at hand.

DOC
So I suppose you want your drugs
back. And I also suppose you
think I want some money -- but
what if it didn't have to be in
the form of money...

CROCKER FENWAY
Well, money would be a lot easier.

DOC
I've been more concerned about the
safety of some people.

CROCKER FENWAY
... How much of a threat are they
to my principles?

DOC
There's a saxophone player named
Coy Harlingen, who's been working
undercover for different
antisubversive outfits, including
the LAPD. He's come to feel lately
that he made the wrong career
choice. It lost him his family
and his freedom. Like you, he has
an only daughter.

CROCKER FENWAY

Please.

DOC
Okay, well, anyway, now he wants
out.

(MORE)
108

121.

DOC (CONT'D)
I think I can square it with the
heat, but there's this other bunch
called Vigilant California and...
well, whoever's running them, of
course.

CROCKER FENWAY
My guess is that they'd prefer he
didn't disclose any confidential
information.

DOC
Last thing he'd ever do.

CROCKER FENWAY
Your personal guarantee.

DOC
I'll go after him myself he tries
anything.

CROCKER FENWAY
That's all you wanted. No money,
now, you sure?

DOC
How much money would I have to
take from you so I don't lose your
respect?

CROCKER FENWAY
People like you lose all claim to
respect the first time they pay
anybody rent.

DOC
And when the first landlord
decided to stiff the first renter
for his security deposit, your
whole fucking class lost
everybody's respect.

CROCKER FENWAY
Ah, so you're looking for what? A
refund? Plus how many years
interest?

DOC
Course. Nothin' to you. Just a
couple hundred bucks to roll up
and snort coke through...

CUT TO:

EXT. SHOPPING MALL (ARTESIA AND HAWTHORNE) - MORNING 108

It's Sunday morning. Empty parking lot. DOC has brought
DENIS along. JADE is in the backseat... They sit in
(some borrowed?) car and wait...
109

122.

DENIS
«+. You should be getting
something for your trouble...

DOC
I'm getting their word they won't
hurt somebody.

DENIS
You believe that?

JADE
I thought I was naive.

DOC
Good people get bought and sold
every day. Might as well trust
somebody evil once in a while, it
makes no more or less sense.

A '53 BUICK ESTATE WAGON carrying a BLOND FAMILY:
MOTHER, FATHER, EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND SIX-YEAR-OLD
SON. GOLDEN FANG OPERATIVES.

The MOTHER is wearing a TENNIS OUTFIT, smoking a
cigarette. The son has buzz cut and already looks like a
Marine and stares Doc down. The Daughter looks like she
has a future in drug abuse. The FATHER and DOC take the
dope and put it in the back of the station wagon...
MOTHER hands over something to DOC.

DOC
What's this?

DAUGHTER
A credit card. Don't hippies have
them?

DOC

I must have meant, why's your mom
handing me this?

MOTHER
It isn't for you.

COY HARLINGEN's name on the card. They drive off. The
Daughter gives Doc the finger. HOLD.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOPANGA CANYON HOUSE - DAY 109

Doc is waiting in the car out front. There's a BUDDHIST
PRIEST walking around the yard with some girl groupies
.-. he's performing an exorcism...

Coy emerges from the house... looking a little paranoid
and confused, walks to Doc, gets in the car...
110

111

123.

coy
Everything's cool...

DOC
Drac's a part of the band?
So... The Boards aren't so evil
anymore?

Coy

Maybe just confused now and
then... you know a band that
isn't? I'm officially off
everybody's payroll. Burke
Stodger called me personally...

CUT TO:

EXT. COY/HOPE'S HOUSE - LATER AFTERNOON 110

Drops Coy off at his place. Coy just breathes,
emotional...

coy
You know what the Indians say.
You saved my life, now you've --

DOC
Yeah, yeah, some hippie made that
up. You saved your life, Coy.
Now you get to live it.

Coy gets out, walks up to his house and is greeted at the
door by HOPE and AMETHYST. Hope and Coy start making
out... HOPE waves to DOC...

DISSOLVE TO:

FISH PLACE - DOC AND SAUNCHO - DAY 111

DOC
Anything you can tell me about an
inherent vice clause?

SAUNCHO
It's what you can't avoid.
DOC
Like... original sin?
SAUNCHO

Stuff Marine policies don't like
to cover. Usually applies to
cargo like eggs break -- chocolate
melts -- glass shatters, that
sorta thing... thinking of --

THE PHONE AT THE BAR RINGS, SAUNCHO RUNS FOR IT... he
listens, then hangs up...
112

113

124.

SAUNCHO
They got her --
Sauncho runs out as fast as he can -- Doc on his heels.
CUT TO:
EXT. SAN PEDRO - DAY 112

Department of Justice and Coast Guard boats have taken
hold of the Golden Fang...

Doc and Sauncho watch from the shore...

SAUNCHO
If she could be brought back in,
into some kind of safe
receivership and the owners don't
come and claim her within a year
and a day -- then she's officially
abandoned.

DOC
And then what?

SAUNCHO
I don't wanna jinx anything --
everybody starts coming out of the
woodwork -- multiple insurers; ex-
old ladies -- maybe one of your
lowlife millionaire friends will
end up stealing her at auction --
but!... say there was a legal
marine policy in force --

DOC
«+. you didn't happen to take out
a policy yourself, Saunch...

SAUNCHO
If there's litigation -- I'll be
on it.

DOC
Well... I hope it works out for

you, man. That boat and you
really do belong together...

Sauncho starts singing "We Should Be Together," from
Little Miss Broadway.

CUT TO:

INT. DOC'S PLACE - DAY 113

Doc is on his couch. LONG PAUSE, THEN: BIGFOOT'S FOOT
SMASHES HIS DOOR DOWN... The door is shattered in a
thousand pieces. Doc looks up scared shitless:
125.

BIGFOOT
Don't get up...
DOC
Bigfoot. Bigfoot, man... smash

down my door?!?! Come on, man...

BIGFOOT
After a long and busy day of civil
rights violations, I found myself
in the neighborhood and compelled
to drop in... just to check and see
the current state of affairs of my
old stomping grounds. Seeing as
your effort to keep lines of
communications open with me have
been limited to say the least...

DOC
I've been busy...

BIGFOOT
Trying to figure out which side of
the Zig-Zag paper is the sticky side?
Then... they both talk at the same time...
DOC/BIGFOOT
Listen... I'm sorry about last night.
You? Why should you be sorry?
The spell is broken.

DOC
Weird.

BIGFOOT
Extraordinary...

Bigfoot looks over Doc's weed supply... BIGFOOT starts to
EAT DOC'S WEED BAG AND JOINTS.

HE SWALLOWS... BIGFOOT takes another BIG BITE OF DOC'S
DRUGS... FINDS SOME PILLS, EATS THEM UP, TOO.
BIGFOOT

This fucking Gordita Beach has
been cursed from the jump. I've
been trying my whole life to get
out of here. Indians lived here
long ago, they had a drug cult,
smoked toloache which is
jimsonweed, gave themselves
hallucinations, deluded themselves
they were visiting other realities
-- why, come to think of it, not
unlike the hippie freaks of our
present day.

(MORE)
114

126.

BIGFOOT (CONT'D)
Their graveyards were sacred
portals of access to the spirit
world, not to be misused. And
Gordita Beach is built right on
top of one.

DOC
Yeah? And these spirits, can you,
like, catch them, Bigfoot?

BIGFOOT
You plod along in pursuit, maybe
only wanting to apologize and they
fly away like the wind, and wait
their moment...

He heads for the door and WALKS INTO THE WALL.

DOC
You okay, brother?
BIGFOOT
I'm not your brother.
DOC
No... but you could sure use a

keeper.

Bigfoot walks out the door and falls over the balcony...

INT. DOC'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT 114

Doc driving on the freeway. Shasta is curled up in the
passenger seat. A fog is rolling in on the Santa Monica
Freeway. Headlights drift ahead and behind him...

SHASTA
Remember that day, the Ouija board
set us off into that big storm?

DOC
One of a couple things I never
forgot -- don't know why.

SHASTA
This feels the same way, tonight.
Just us. Together. Almost like
being underwater. The world,
everything gone someplace else.

DOC
Figured it was Sortilege just
settin' us up.

SHASTA
No, she...

DOC
Her Ouija board...
127.

SHASTA
She knows things, Doc... maybe
about us that we don't know...
DOC
This don't mean we're back
together.
SHASTA

Course not.
She drifts -- off to sleep.

SORTILEGE (V.O.)
Doc fell into a car convoy, moving
slowly, single lane through the
fog. He figured if he missed the
Gordita Beach exit, he'd take the
first one whose sign he could read
and work his way back on surface
streets. He knew that at
Rosecrans, the freeway began to
dogleg east, and at some point,
Hawthorne Boulevard or Artesia,
he'd lose the fog, unless it was
spreading tonight, and settled in
region wide... Maybe then it would
stay this way for days, maybe he'd
have to just keep driving, down
past Long Beach, down through
Orange County, and San Diego and
across a border where nobody could
tell anymore in the fog who was
Mexican, who was Anglo, who was
anybody. Then again, he might run
out of gas before that happened,
and have to leave the caravan, and
pull over on the shoulder, and
wait. For whatever would happen.
For a forgotten joint to
materialize in his pocket. For the
CHP to come by and choose not to
hassle him. For a restless blonde
in a Stingray to stop and offer him
a ride. For the fog to burn off,
and for something else this time,
somehow, to be there instead.

FADE OUT.
