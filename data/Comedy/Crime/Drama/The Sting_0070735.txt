FADE IN
EXT, A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY

It's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the streets
of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters), and the

- point-men for juvenile gangs. We pick up a solitary figure,

Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering what appears
to be an abandoned tenement. He pauses a second to dust his
white-winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants legs.
Sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is
making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all
bands, he seems an incongruity in this part of town.

We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second ficor
flat. He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious door-
man.

INT. NUMBERS SPOT = DAY

Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring
people, This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place
immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet

on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the
600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right. The
bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table,
where they place their bets and are given receipts in return.
Others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous earn-
ings or to ask fer credit.

Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting
slips are being sorted and meney counted under the watchful
and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man
named Mr. Granger, The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on
the radio in the background. “

Mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little inter-
est, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a little
pinch on the cheek. The girl slaps his hand away, obviously
having been through this before.

PHONE GIRL
Beat it, Mottcla.

Granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola,
who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio. The
phone rings.
PHONE GIRL
8720.,.Yes, hold on a second.
(calling over to
the Supervisor)
Mr. Granger, Chicago on the line.

Granger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago,
but takes the phone anyway. :

-INT. A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY

A flabby, bald man named Combs is on the other end of the line.
Visible beyond the door and interior window of his office is

a large room, cluttered with tables, typewriters, clerks and
adding machines. This room is the clearinghouse for all the
transaction of the numbers game. All the betting slips and
income from the spots are brought in here and processed.

COMBS
Granger, this is Combs. Why haven't
we heard from ya? Everybody else
is in. .

GRANGER .
We had a few problems with the Law
this morning. The Mayor promised
the Jaycees to get tough on the
rackets again, so he shut every-
body down for a couple hours to
make it look good. Nothing serious,
it just put us a little behind for
the day.

COMBS
You been making your payoffs,
haven't ya? :

GRANGER
Hell yes. He does this every year.
There's nothing to worry about.

CcolBSs
Okay, finish your count and get it
up here as soon as you can. I.don't
wanta be here all night.

GRANGER
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real
happy. Looks like we cleared over
ten grand this veek.

Mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat
pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky. No
one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed
Messenger boy.

EXT. OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN

Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley.

He walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a
larger alleyway; this one connecting two streets. The alley
is deserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young
stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction.

The man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a
hurry.

Suddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere
behind him. He turns around to see a small, weathered
locking thief come racing around the corner and down the
alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired
black man. Limping noticeably, the black man manages a
few cries for help and then stumbles and falls. The stranger
yells at Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then
readies himself for the arrival of the thief. Mottola just
stands there, not the least interested in the exercise of
justice, Just as the thief is about to run on by, the
stranger throws his suitcase at the little man's legs,
sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet
he's been carrying in his left hand.

The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back
to where Mottola is standing. Almost by reflex, Mottola
picks it up. The thief scrambles to his feet and starts
back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.

Both the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an
attack. The thief. realizing that there are twg people
to fight, begins to think better of it. He is not a young
man, nor particularly strong.

THIEF
(shaking his fist
at the stranger) .
You goddam nigger-lover. I'll get
you for this someday, sucker egg.

Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the
thief flees out onto the street and disappears. The black
man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feec and is staggering
toward them. He collapses against the alley wall after a
few steps. The stranger rushes over to him, followed some-
what absently by Mottola.

BLACK MAN -
The wallet. You gotta go after him.
He's got all the money.

STRANGER —
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What
happened? He get ya with the knife?

Mottola has given him his wallet, which the black man now
opens, disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber

band. Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount
of money.

STRANGER

So long, partner, Don't worry,

The Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of
worry on his face. Mottola trots off down the alley and

out onto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of
trouble, He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the :
cab stand in the distance. Suddenly the little man with

the knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him.
Mottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking
into a dead run. . :

We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening
a big lead on the guy with the knife, He reaches the taxi
zone. He hops in a cab and slams the door.

He jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.

hightailing it down the street, two newly solvent con artists
on the lam. It's hard to run they're laughing so hard. The
stranger chucks his suitcase into a trash can, and pulls into
an alcove. The older black man is puffing and out of breath.

BLACK MAN
Hold on Johnny. Oh man, was that
beautiful! Let's see it ---

The stranger gets out the envelope and starts tearing it
open,

STRANGER
I was sure he was on to us.

He stops as the stranger pulls the numbers money out of the
envelope. They stare at it.

TITLES SEQUENCE

Done to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to
establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to friends
and enemies alike as Hooker. We see the following:

EXT. PAWNSHOP = DAY - LOOKING INSIDE

Hooker is getting a radio and a garish suit out of hock. It's
like seeing old friends again. All pantomime.

“INT. HOOKER'S ROOM - DAY

A shabby little place he rents above a cigar store. We pick
him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up
on the fire escape. The rinse water drips down through the

Little more than a converted brick basement, the Place contains
three shoddy, homemade roulette tables. Hooker, accompanied

Hooker goes to a table where there are already several other
people laying their bets for the next spin. Hooker knows the
wheelman, .an old-timer named Jimmy. .

As Jimmy finishes his spiel, he starts the. wheel spinning
and drops in the ball. Betting is allowed to continue until
the ball drops from the outer ring into the center.

HOOKER
(taking out
his wallet)
Three grand on the black.

Jimmy is stunned. The others at the table, used to dollar
bets, look at Hooker like he's some kind of foreign dignitary.

JIMMY

You sure you wanna start off that
big? Bet like that could put a
real dent in us, .

HOOKER

HOOKER :

Jimmy wants to argue some more, but the ball is getting ready
te drop into the center. We see Jimmy quickly press a hidden
lever under the table with his foot. ‘The ball falls and
settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite right.
The others at the table fail to notice, but Hooker is not
fooled. He stares venomously at Jimmy, who knows that
Hooker is on to him.

at levity, in order

HOOKER

Jimmy doesn't know what the hell to do. He gives Hooker a (
little head motion to indicate a large and menacing thug sittin
in a corner watching them. Suddenly, Hooker understands why
Jimmy had to cheat him, but it doesn't change his demand.

HOOKER
Spin it anyway, Jimmy.

Jimmy is beside himself. If he doesn't spin again, Hooker may
expose him. If he does spin, and loses, his management will
fire him. He pleads to Hooker with his eyes; but it's no use;
Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the ball. This
time there is no foot on the lever, and it settles into black
15. Hooker stares at the ball a second and then looks up at
his terrified friend.

A late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front
of the plant. Out bursts a carefully-groomed, tight-lipped
young man named Greer, who hustles into the plant. We
follow him through a maze of machinery to the service
elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves
in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier.

INSIDE THE FARO ROOM

Ih the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table, on which
sit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone-faced
Dealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous
monotone. On his right is a bookish little man with an
abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have
already been played. On the opposite side of the table,
completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards
from the dealing box, sits Doyle Lonnegan. Although his
clothes ard accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is
@ coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak
lower class origins, for which he now has nothing but contempt.

Floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying

_hard to make as little noise as possible. :

FLOYD

from the table)

trademark. We begin with ---

A tall, good-looking man, Kid Twist, making his way through
the railway station. Impeccably dressed and carrying a small
suitcase, he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes.
Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing he's been looking
for. It's Gondorff, standing by a newsstand. Gondorff makes
a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off a gnat.

for a second and sees Gondorff “officing" him from across the
bank. Without a word he shoves the money he's been counting
back into the hands of a startled customer, abruptly closes
up his window, flips his identification tag on the manager's

No. He owns most of the stock,

papéring the walls, tacking down carpet, putting in new light
fixtures, painting signs, all under the supervision of Niles.
From now on, we will refer to the pool hall as the store.

Back in the office, Kid Twist is "interviewing" one by one,

a group of con men lined up outside the office door. A gray-
haired old buzzard, Curly Jackson, approaches the table which
is serving Twist as a desk, Curly is practically in rags and
has several days growth on his face. He wears a little beret
which he takes off to address Twist.

shot glass and the bottle next to him, from which he has been

drinking heavily. He and Lonnegan are the only ones left in

drive out the smell of onions and grease.

A waitress, Loretta, emerges from the kitchen and ambles slowly

Hooker,. seizing the time, bursts out of the stall and runs
back out through the diner. Cole sees him, but too late to
‘get off a shot. He climbs back in the window and gives chase.

We pick up Hooker barreling down the street with Cole a hundre
yards or so behind. Hooker makes a sharp cut into an alley,
and we see immediately that it's a hopeless dead end. Inex-

Cole draws up and cuts into the alley, anticipating the kill

miraculously, has vanished. Cole scans the alley frantically
for some trace of him. There are no windows or doors at the

impossible. Hooker has disappeared into thin air.

Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse,

and disappears into an adjacent building that advertises rooms
for rent. After a few seconds, we see a light come on in one

Gonderff, Hooker and the others waiting, the tension expressec

165 INT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY

Lonnegan sits tensely in the usual booth. He keeps both hands
firmly planted on the brief case. The phone rings and Lonnegan
goes to it. Music ends.

VOICE
Place it on Syphon at four to one.

-,Lonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer. Eigh
to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for.

166 EXT. STREET

We follow Lonnegan across the street and into the store. The
bodyguards remain outside.

167 INT. STORE

The store is buzzing with activity. Money and booze are every
where. The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly keep
up with the action. Lonnegan walks quickly to the betting lin
and finds to his relief that there's only one man ahead of him
The man puts $25,000 on King's Image.

Lonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and op
it for Niles to see. : .
LONNEGAN
(straight-faced)
Five hundred grand on-Syphon.

Niles is struck dumb. He's never seen that much money before.
NILES
(playing the
fiustered clerk)
Hold on, I'll have to get the

Niles goes and returns with Gondorff.

Gondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at
Lonnegan like he's gotta be crazy.

GONDORFP
(uneasily)
I can't lay that off in time. We
lose a bet that big, it could break

Gonderff looks at Lonnegan long and hard.

Youtre dumber than I thought, :
Lonnegan.

LONNEGAN .
You're more gutless than I thought.

The words “Last Flash" are heard on the speaker. Gondorff
looks at Lonnegan with utter contempt. He turns to Niles.

(chopped)
Take it.

Niles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500,000 dollars. Lonnega
allowing himself a sly smile, picks it up and retires to a near
by table. He flashes a little okay sign to Hocker who acknowl-
edges it with a nod.

Lonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair,
the larceny boiling in his veins. Hooker looks to Gondorff,
Gondorff gives him the "office." Hooker has to smile.

CALLER
And around the first turn it's King's
“Image by a neck, Syphon is second by
one, Key to the Vault third by one
half, followed by Mr. Moonlight, Red
Ridge, Moneyman and No Charge.

Unexpectedly, Kid Twist bursts if through the entrance.
Barely able to control his enthusiasm, he hurries over to
~Lonnegan's table and sits down next to him.

TWIST
Sorry, but I just couldn't wait. -
Did everything go all right?

LONNEGAN
(motioning for him to
keep his voice down)
Take it easy. Everything's all
right. I put it on Syphon, on the -
nose,

Twist
{in utter horror)
On the nose! I said place. Place
it on Syphon. That horse is going
to run second.

Lonnegan looks like he's just been stabbed. , He vaults over
the table to the teller's window and grabs Niles.

LONNEGAN
You give me my goddamn money back!
You hear me? There's been a mis-

take:
- NILES
I'm sorry, six. The betting's

closed.

Lonnegan begins to shake him violently.
LONNEGAN

You give me my money back. There's

been a mistake, do you hear me?
Gondorff leaps to Niles' aid when suddenly there is a crash
at the entrance door, and Polk, Snyder and eight federal
agents burat into the room, guns drawn. The place falls

afraid to move. Gondorff and Niles look at each other
wondering how this could have possibly happened.

POLK
(motioning to Eooker)
All right, Hooker, you can go.

Hooker's eyes go to Gondorff, who looks back at‘him in utter
disbelief, the betrayal raging in his features. Hooker,
unable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk
out. ‘Almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at
Gondorff's belt. A small gun. A shot. Hooker clutches his

... back and fakls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from his

mouth. Polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into
Gondorff, who goes down in a heap. Pandemonium breaks loose.
The members of the boost race for the door. Lonnegan is —
totally stunned, First he lost his money and now he's in-
volved in a murder. Snyder rushes over to hin.

SNYDER
C'mon. We gotta get you outa here.

EXT. STREET

Snyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street
where an F.B.I. car is waiting. His bodyguards have long
since fled at the sight of the F.5.1. men.

LONNEGAN

. My money's back there.
SNYDER

We'll worry about that later.

Snyder gets in beside Lonnegan, and the car speeds away.

The pandemonium has now ceased. Those who could escape have;
the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking position,
Gondorff and Hooker lie on the floor dead. The loudspeaker

apparently oblivious to what's happened.
