SHOOTING DRAFT

October 14, 2002
FADE IN:

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

An immaculate pool -- clean, clear and placid -- crowds
the back yard, bouncing light against the house.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - AT WINDOW - DAY

The pool can be seen THROUGH filigreed metallic blinds.
ROY ENTERS FRAME, suited, coffee cup in hand, and peers
out at it for a spell. A calming moment to start his
day. Then:

He raises the blinds, wincing at the floor of sunlight.
He checks the window's lock, re-locks it for good
measure, then closes the shade again.

AT NEXT WINDOW

The ritual repeated: blinds up, window's locked, he re-
locks it.

AT THIRD

Repeated.

INT. ROY'S HALLWAY - MORNING

Three doors line the left wall; one divides the right;
all are shut. Roy emerges from the nearest door on the
left (a bedroom) and shuts it behind him. He crosses to
the single door on the right (a bathroom), opens it,
enters, and shuts it behind him. WATER RUNS and a TOILET
FLUSHES.

He reappears, shuts the door behind him, and enters the
middle door on the left (another bedroom, unoccupied).
He re-emerges with a handkerchief in hand, then in
pocket, and a beeper on his belt, and again shuts the
door behind him.

He starts for the far door (to a living room) but manages
only a few steps before he stops, turns, and heads back
to the bathroom door. He opens it and peers inside. A
three-count and he shuts it again.
INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - DAY

Roy rinses out his mug of coffee, washes the sink basin
clean of it, wipes down the kitchen countertop, already
spotless, and lets the faucet run as --

-- he takes from a cupboard an unlabeled vial of pills.
Pulls off the cap, taps two capsules into his palm. And
just stares at it. Anxious and exhausted.

Then: He tosses the pills down his throat, chases them
with tap water, and gives the faucet a firm tug off.

INT. ROY'S CHEVY CAPRICE - DAY

Window cracked just enough to suck out his cigarette
smoke. AM-FM forecasts the natural weather, region-by-
region.

RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
Elsewhere, temperatures in New
York in the high 80's, Chicago
reports rain, temperatures in the
high 70's...

EXT. STOPLIGHT - DAY

Roy slows to a halt behind a mini-van full of kids. They
laugh and scream and wave at Roy. His hands stay glued
at 2 and 10.

FRANK (V.O.)
No, ma'am, it's confirmed --

INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY

FRANK MERCER, younger than Roy, works the phones. A sea
of papers floods his desk, while the adjoining desk
(Roy's) is pristine. In lieu of decor there are stacks
of cardboard boxes piled everywhere.

FRANK
-- the Chevy Blazer, the Paris
vacation, or the Tiffany necklace.
It's okay if you don't remember
entering the contest, ma'am,
you've won --

The next call --

FRANK
-- do you have a water filtration
system in your house? Do you read
the papers or watch TV, sir? Then
you've probably seen our
advertisements --

The next call --

FRANK
-- we just have to wait for the
sponsor's rep to fly in for the
final drawing. That should be
next week sometime --

OMITTED 8

INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY 9
At his window, Frank watches Roy, frozen in his car.

FRANK
-- if you buy the Waterford II
water filtration system, the prize
gets recorded as a sales expense
and you don't pay any tax. Good
deal, huh?

Frank turns to one of the boxes marked "Waterford II" and
peels off a price sticker: $49.99.

FRANK
$398.00 even. You'd pay twice
that in stores.
SAME - MINUTES LATER 10

Roy enters, shuts the door behind him.

FRANK

You want to what? When will he be
home?

(beat)
Mrs. Fisk, my supervisor just
stepped into my office and he
would love to talk to you. Can
you hold just a sec?

(puts her on hold;

to Roy, overly sunny)
Good morning. Something on the
radio?

 

(he offers phone)
Irene Fisk. ‘Wants to talk to her
husband first.’

ROY
Who doesn't?

Roy declines Frank's phone, moves to his own. He plucks
up the receiver, cleans its mouthpiece with his
handkerchief, then un-holds Mrs. Fisk. The moment he

does, his

whole personality transforms.

ROY

Mrs. Fisk? John Goodhew, regional
vice-president at Allied
Affiliates. Congratulations!
Which prize are you hoping for?

(beat)
That would be my choice, too. Can
I ask you one question, Irene? Do
you have grandchildren?

(beat)
Five! How old? Well, you're a
very lucky woman. Yes, I agree:
they are our most precious
resource. I've got a six and two-
year old at home and I'll tell
you: the day I installed a
filtrator... Absolutely you can
taste the difference. Now I
understand you'd like to talk to
your husband about this first, and
I understand why, but the thing
is, Irene --

(confidentially)
-- my secretary is having a baby
this afternoon and the whole
office here is about to bug out
and go over to the hospital. Yes,
it's very exciting. But today is
our deadline, so you see...

Listening, Roy nods to Frank: she's in. Frank goes to
work -- calling a courier service on Roy's line (his

mouth grazing the receiver, Roy notices) -- as Roy

finishes up. And though his voice may be grinning, his
eyes betray him: he doesn't enjoy this.

ROY
Irene, that's sweet of you to
offer, and I'm sure she'd love
that, but we're in Chicago. Uh-
huh, cooped up in our corporate
offices on State Street. I'll
tell you, though, I rather be out
in sunny California with you today
‘cause it's just pouring up here.
Cats and dogs, exactly. Now let
me confirm your address for our
courier service...

INT. ROY'S CAPRICE (OFFICE PARKING LOT) - DAY 11

Roy behind the wheel; Frank knots his tie. Windows up
tight.

FRANK
You got any thoughts on lunch?

Roy nods. A long-standing joke: the non-answer answer.
Frank angles his foot up on the dash, and Roy points it
off.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 12

Roy moves briskly ahead of Frank along a sidewalk, his
hands thrust deep in his coat pockets, which he does
whenever he's outside.

EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS HOME 13

Door answered by a MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE. Roy and Frank
stand on her front porch. Roy presents identification.

ROY

Carolyn Schaffer?

(as she nods)
I'm Agent Kellaway, this is Agent
Cole, we're from the Federal Trade
Commission. Sorry to disturb you.
We'd like to ask you a few
questions if we could.

HOUSEWIFE
Is everything alright?
ROY
We hope so, ma'am. May we come
in?
EN - DAY 14

Roy and Frank sit at a breakfast table, across from the

Housewife
testimony:

and her HUSBAND. The Housewife gives her

HOUSEWIFE
He said there'd been a contest,
and I'd won a prize. He said
there'd be a drawing in a week,
and I'd either win a trip to, um,
France or Italy, I can't remember.
He said if I bought one of their
products, their filtration things,
I wouldn't have to pay tax of the
prize.

She indicates a Waterford II installed on her kitchen
faucet, then wilts under her husband's stare.

HUSBAND
Jesus, Carolyn...

HOUSEWIFE
(penitent, near tears)
I was going to surprise you...

ROY
I'm sorry to tell you this, ma'am,
but you won't be receiving any
prize. And I'm sorry to tell you
you've been the victim of fraud.

HUSBAND
(pissed, taking it out
on family dog who
scratches at door)
Otis! Knock it off!

FRANK
It's not the newest swindle in the
world, just new to some. They
bait you with something bogus,
then sell you something worthless.

(CONTINUED )

ROY
How much did you give them, Mrs.
Schaffer?
HOUSEWIFE

Seven hundred dollars.

HUSBAND
Ah, Jesus, Carolyn...
(to Frank and Roy)
What's it worth?

FRANK
Any hardware store they're about
fifty bucks --

ROY
But we've met people who paid
twice what you did.
(to Housewife)
You wrote a check, ma'am?
(as she nods)
Did you mail it to them?

HOUSEWIFE
A courier picked it up.

Roy and Frank exchange grimaces.

HUSBAND
What?

ROY
If they use the postal system,
it's mail fraud and we can go
after them. Otherwise, there's
not a lot we can do.

FRANK
Unless...

HUSBAND
Unless what?

ROY

A lot of these sons-of-bitches --

excuse me, ma'am -- they work in
syndicates. If they cashed your

check out of state, it's federal

and we can act. But we'd need a

signed clearance from you for your

bank to run a trace on the check,

and then --

chance feels inside
his pocket)
Wait, here we go.

the form and lays it before the Husband.

ROY
Here, use my pen.

As the Husband's eyes glaze over the small print, the DOG

SCRATCHES

at the door again.

HUSBAND
Let him out, will ya, Carolyn?

The Housewife slides open a glass door for the dog, then
returns to her seat -- without closing it behind her.
Roy's focus fixes on it. And every voice drifts into
the distance.

ROY
All we need is the name of your
bank, your account number and your
signature at the bottom. Any
luck, these guys were amateurs,
cashed your check in Nevada.

HUSBAND
See, darling? I told you: you're
too trusting. You gotta be more
careful of people.

FRANK
I'm sorry to say, ma'am, he's
absolutely right.

HUSBAND
(signing L-47)
Here ya go.

uneasy stare)
You alright?

Frank notices now, too -- Roy is sweating and uneasy,
fixated on the small wilderness outside -- and recognizes

the cause of his infirmity: the open door.

FRANK
Do you mind if I close this?

They don't. Frank rises and closes the glass door. Roy
snaps out of it. Sound within the room returns to normal.

ROY
Sorry. I'm fine, thanks.
(he takes L-47)
Thank you.

Frank smiles to allay the Husband's suspicions: What the
fuck was that about?

EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 15
Roy and Frank return to their car, Roy speedily.

FRANK
You're not taking your pills, are you?

Roy faces him, testily, but he never pauses in his effort
to get inside his car as fast as he can. Frank,
admonished, takes his time getting in.

FRANK
It's just that... you looked like
you were gonna whoopsy-daisy all
over those people's Oriental.

A breath to compose himself and Roy STARTS the CAR.

FRANK
You are taking your pills?
ROY
(at last)
Yes.
The car pulls out.
EXT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY Al6é

The Caprice pulls into the parking lot. Inside, Frank
splits up the day's take, fifty-fifty. Roy seems barely
interested.

FRANK

Well, it's not a fortune, but it
keeps me in diapers. Barely. One
look at those drapes I should have
known.

I saw that guy again last night:
Chuck. The guy I was telling you,
with the --

ROY
-- with the boat.

FRANK
(sing-song)
He's top-heavy.
(off no response
from Roy)
It's real money, Roy.

ROY
If it's real money, it's long con.
I don't do long con.

FRANK
You haven't done it lately.

Frank is looking for a glimmer of hope. Roy gives him none.

ROY
Without me, Frank.

Frank puts up his hands: never mind.

FRANK
Okay. I'd just like to, you know,
take a girl out somewhere nice
once in a while.

ROY
(beat)
You have to pay her extra for that?

16 INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT AISLE - DAY 16

Roy drops a half-dozen cans of Chicken-By-the-Sea on the
conveyor. The CHECK-OUT WOMAN totals them:

CHECK-OUT WOMAN
... four, five, six. And a pack
of Winston's.

For Roy, it's a standing order here.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02 10A.
EXT. ROY'S HOME - DAY 17

A modest one-story. Roy's Caprice pulls in the driveway.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 18

Roy, shoeless, skirts the living room rug to approach a
ceramic horse in the corner, next to a sofa. He slides
its head up and off its body and rests it on the floor,
then reaches into its hollow belly to withdraw a .38. He
removes from his jacket the day's take and stuffs it
inside the horse. He replaces the weapon atop it.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - AT TABLE - NIGHT 19
Roy eats dinner: tuna, straight from the can.

AT SINK

He washes out the empty can, then turns to his shoes,
rinsing and wiping down their soles.

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 20

Predictably Spartan. Roy wears pajamas to bed. He lies
down, head on his pillow, eyes toward the ceiling, wide
and anxious and exhausted and sad, to smoke himself to
sleep.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 21

The morning ritual again. Roy stares out his window,
coffee cup in hand, at the pool. And his moment of
serenity has been violated for --

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 22

Two leaves float atop the pool surface. Roy, with a
long-pole net, removes them.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN 23

Roy throws the leaves away in the trash below the sink,
then rinses out his coffee mug/washes down the
basin/cleans the countertop/lets the faucet run. Finds
his vial of pills and taps two capsules into his palm.
Sets the vial down beside the sink. Stares at the pills
again --

-- then throws them back in his throat and washes them
down with tap water (filtrated by a Waterford II). He
reaches to turn the faucet off --

-- and accidentally knocks the uncapped vial into the
sink, upending it and sending pills scattering.

ROY
Dammit!
He grabs for the vial, empty -- pills are swirling down
the drain -- then scrambles for the tap, slamming it off,

but too late: all the capsules have been swept away.

ROY
Shit!

Roy frets, thinks, decides. Rolling up his sleeve, he

dips his hand into the sink's disposal, patting around

its base for pills.

At last, he finds one. Pinches it and raises it into the
light. And Roy knows: there's no way he'll ever put

that thing in his mouth.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 24

Roy's on his portable phone, desperate.

ROY
Hi, I need to talk to Mancuso.
(beat)
Man-cus-o.
(beat)
What do you mean he...?
(beat)

You gotta be shitting me...

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

Roy frets, paces. He stops, looks down. He's been

walking on the living room rug -- disaster.

INT. ROY'S CLOSET 25

Roy yanks out his vacuum cleaner.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM 26

Roy VACUUMS the rug back-and-forth, back-and-forth, back-
and-forth. He STOPS. Studies the rug. Then looks up.
Suddenly everything looks dirty.

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN 27
Under the sink, Roy rifles through a gallery of cleaning
products -- Pine Sol, Murphy's Oil Soap, Ajax, Windex.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM 28

Roy cleans. Dishwashing gloves on, down on his knees.

Roy cleans behind the toilet. The PHONE RINGS in the
next room. Roy shows no interest in answering it.

FRANK (V.O.over message machine)
Roy, pick up. It's me, pick up,
Roy. Roy, where are you?

INT. ROY'S KITCHEN 30

Roy takes his lunch break, one dishwashing glove removed,
eating straight from the can again.

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE 31

Roy cleans all the windows, from the inside only --
SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK. The PHONE RINGS again.

INT. ROY'S HOUSE - MEDLEY OF PRISTINE ROOMS - LATER 32

FRANK (V.O.on machine again)
What the hell, Roy. I feel like a
chick. Okay, that's it. I'm
coming over.

ROY (0.S.)
Shit.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM 33

Roy sits prone on his couch. Eyes bloodshot and weary,
studying the carpet. There is a KNOCK at the front door.

FRANK (0.S.)
Roy! You in there? Roy!

Roy does not respond. Frank KNOCKS some more.

FRANK (0.S.)
Roy, goddammit! Your car's here,
I know you're here!

(beat)
I'll call the cops, I'll do it.
I'll put all my shit where they
can't find it, I'll call them and
they'll come down here!

Roy surrenders: he gets off the couch.
14.

34 AT HIS FRONT DOOR 34

Roy unlocks it, opens it, latch on. Frank's nose and
mouth appear in the opening.

Roy shuts

FRANK
(sigh of relief)
Thank Jesus. Open up, lemme in.

ROY
Take off your shoes.
FRANK
What? Why?
ROY
Take ‘em off, or you don't come
in.

You didn't take your pills, did
you?

the door, walks away.

FRANK (0.S.)
Okay, okay, shoes are coming off.

(as he takes them off)
Okay, Roy.

Roy returns, unlatches and opens the door. Frank enters
and the scent of ammonia slams his nostrils.

Roy can't.

FRANK
Mother... You get attacked by Mr.
Clean? Roy, you gotta open a
window.

ROY

No. Windows.
(as Frank just
stares at him)
Looking for something?

FRANK
My partner. You seen him? He's
been missing most of the week.

(beat)
Tell me you've left the house in
three days.

Besides canned tuna?

peculiar.

ROY
Watch -- the rug.

Frank stops short of it. Looks at Roy.

A beat.

FRANK
You didn't take your --

ROY
I spilled them. Down the garbage
disposal. By accident.

FRANK
You call Mancuso?

ROY
He moved.

FRANK

You gotta be shitting me.

ROY
That's what I said.

FRANK
Take a shower. I'm gonna make a
call. My aunt saw this shrink
after her divorce, he really --

Roy: you need to see someone.
Listen, don't think I'm doing this
just for you. You got money you
can retire, I got car payments,
you know. I don't need a partner
who's --

Frank pantomimes a mad-act spasm. Roy relents. As he
heads for the bathroom, Frank picks up the phone, dials.

ROY
Frank.

FRANK
Yeah?

ROY

Wipe that thing down when you're
done with it, okay?

A beat. Frank looks to be at the end of his rope.

FRANK
Go take that shower, Roy.

INT. SMALL OFFICE BUILDING COURTYARD 36

Beside a door, a plaque reads: "DR. HARRIS KLEIN, M.D."
Roy watches from a darkened breezeway, smoking, hands in
coat pockets. He stamps out his cigarette and approaches.

INT. DR. KLEIN'S OFFICE - DAY 37

Roy, at the far end of a small couch, stares at a pair of
Florsheims crossed atop an ottoman. They belong to DR.
KLEIN, who scans Roy's form.

DR. KLEIN
You mind if I put them up? It
helps my back.

ROY
Go ahead.

DR. KLEIN
(re: his form)
You're something of a clean slate,
Roy. This says you were on
medication but you don't know what
kind.
(CONTINUED )
37

CONTINUED:

17.

ROY
They were green capsules. I think
it said P.D.F. on them. Something
like that.

DR. KLEIN
You were getting them illegally?
(as Roy balks)
We're starting fresh today, Roy.
What happened in the past I don't
care about.

ROY
That's a funny thing for a shrink
to say.

Klein smiles; Roy doesn't.

ROY
Yes. I was getting them
illegally.

DR. KLEIN
Why?

ROY

So I wouldn't have to talk to
someone like you. Do you know
what they were?

DR. KLEIN
Yes. And at the dosage you say
you were taking, I'd say you were
lucky to be sitting up straight!--

ROY
Can you get me more of them?

DR. KLEIN
Let's talk a little first. It
says here you're --

ROY
-- I'm sorry, Doc, but my partner,
my buddy Frank --

DR. KLEIN
-- Beth Mercer's nephew --

(CONTINUED )
37

CONTINUED:

18.
(2) 37

ROY
-- he said I could come here and
you'd get me the pills I need. If
you can't do that, this session's
over before it's started.

DR. KLEIN
You certainly get to the point.

ROY
And you skirt it. Can you get me
the pills or not?

DR. KLEIN
Yes.

ROY
Then let's get that prescription
pad out.

DR. KLEIN

Roy, usually I don't prescribe
medicine unless I've had a little
chat with the patient first. If
you're inclined against that,
then!-- as you say -- this session
will be quite brief.

Roy stares the doctor down. Klein never blinks.

DR. KLEIN
It says here you're an antiques
dealer. How long you been in that
line?

Nothing from Roy. The face-off continues.

DR. KLEIN
Would you like to tell me what's
been bothering you?

And continues. Then, abruptly, Roy quits.

ROY
I get tired a lot, but I can't
sleep. Certain things distract
me, make me feel sick to my
stomach.

DR. KLEIN
What kinds of things?

ROY
When people leave doors open, or
windows. I don't like being
outdoors. They call that
agoraphobia, right?

DR. KLEIN
Incorrectly, but yes. Anything
else?

ROY

Dirt. Especially around moldings.

Klein makes a note.

A beat.

A beat.

DR. KLEIN
Have these distractions affected
your work of late?
(off Roy's nod)
And your personal relationships?

ROY
What personal relationships?

DR. KLEIN
When was the last time you were in
one? A relationship?

ROY
With a woman? A long time ago.
DR. KLEIN
Five years? Ten years?
ROY
Keep going.
DR. KLEIN

What was her name?

ROY
Heather.

DR. KLEIN
Were you married?
(off Roy's nod)
Kids?

(CONTINUED )
37

CONTINUED:

20.
(4) 37

ROY
Maybe.

DR. KLEIN
Maybe. That's a new one.

ROY
She was pregnant when she left me.
Maybe I got a kid, maybe I don't.

DR. KLEIN
You haven't seen her since?
ROY
No.
DR. KLEIN

You haven't spoken?

ROY

She left with a black eye, which I
gave her, and a bun in the oven,
which might have come from anyone.
So, no, I haven't. For all I know
she got hit by a bus. For all I
know she got rid of the baby,
‘cause she'd been down that path
before.

(a breath to cool

his temper)
Doc: I spent last Tuesday on my
living room sofa. Watching my
carpet. Watching fibers on my
carpet. And the whole time I was
watching my carpet I was worrying
that I might vomit, and the whole
time I was worrying I might vomit,
I was thinking: I’m a grown man,
I should know what's going on in
my head. And the more I thought
about it the more I realized I
should just blow my brains out and
end it all, but the more I wanted
to blow my brains out, the more I
thought about what that would do
to my goddamn carpet.

(beat)
And that was a good day, Doc. So
gimme some pills and let me get on
with my life.

Roy pushes a blue capsule out of a foil-bottom packet,
downs it with coffee. He stops to think.

AT TABLE

He opens the phone book, flips pages to "F." His finger
scans names, comes up empty. He closes the book in
surrender.

ON PHONE
He hasn't quit yet, poised with pen and pad.

What about in Orange County?

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT B39
Roy sits on the edge of the bed, staring at Heather's
number. He picks up his phone, starts to dial, then

hangs up. He's scared shitless. He closes his eyes,
breathless, sucks down part of a Winston. Then picks up

the phone again, dials.

I was young, she was very young.
We met in a bar. Discovered we
both had similar interests.
Basically, drinking and --

DR. KLEIN
Sexual intercourse.

That was later. After things got
bad. We fought a lot.

DR. KLEIN
About what?
ROY
What have you got? I wasn't sober
a lot then --
DR. KLEIN
Are you now?
ROY

(nods )

come home. She was pregnant two
months before she told me. Which
is why I...

DR. KLEIN
Hit her?

DR. KLEIN
Do you think about her much? What
could have been, what might have
been.

Roy shakes his head.

DR. KLEIN
And the baby?
ROY
If there's a baby.
DR. KLEIN
Do you think about that?
ROY
Sometimes. Rarely. If I seea

Roy waits. Dr. Klein appears from his stockroom/closet
and hands Roy a handful of unlabeled sampler packs.

DR. KLEIN
Congratulations. You bought
yourself a month's worth.

ROY
Doc, do you know of a way of...?
Just to find out...

DR. KLEIN
There's nothing wrong, Roy, with a
man telephoning his ex-wife.

ROY
I tried that last night.
(withdraws the
number from his

Couldn't say a word.
Klein looks surprised. Roy pushes the number on him.

ROY
Could you? Call her?

DR. KLEIN
I don't know, Roy. I, uh...

ROY
Just to find out.

Klein hesitates: This is unorthodox. But that's what Roy
wants. At last, Klein relents; he takes Heather's number.

No. She doesn't. I'm sorry. She
didn't understand it might help

ROY
You told her I was in therapy.

DR. KLEIN (V.O.on phone)
I told her I was a psychiatrist.
I can't lie, Roy. Angela wants to

Through the door: The unmistakable convulsions of a man
puking up everything he has. Then:

ROY (0.S.)
Where?

MOVING SHOT 47
MOVING UNDER a highway sign: SAN PEDRO.

Then DOWN TO: Roy's Caprice, Roy at the wheel, white
knuckles at two and ten.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK - DAY 48

Except for one young mother and her infant, empty.
Stopped across the street, Roy checks his watch -- he's
early. He burrows out a cigarette, lights it, and
unrolls his window an eighth of an inch.

SAME SCENE - LATER 49

Roy is chain-lighting his next cigarette, then pushing
the old butt through the window crack, when in his side
mirror: A YOUNG GIRL floats INTO VIEW atop a skateboard.
Pretty but not fully formed, slender but not fragile.

She rides past his Caprice, then dismounts and walks into
the park.

Roy doesn't move.

SAME SCENE - LATER 50

The Young Girl sits waiting, rolling her skateboard back-
and-forth. Roy remains in his car, watching, amazed,
bewildered.

SAME SCENE - LATER 51
The Girl stands, looks this way and that, then gives up.
She mounts her board and starts away, and as she passes
Roy's car, he can see: there's disappointment in her

eyes.

The Girl stops. Roy stumbles out of his Caprice, clothes
disheveled, cigarette dangling from his mouth.

ROY
You Angela?

ANGELA (YOUNG GIRL)
You Roy?

He nods. Father and daughter meet.

ON PARK SWINGS 52
Angela rocks gently. Roy stands nearby, on pavement, not
sand, hands deep in his pockets. He doesn't know what to
say, except:

ROY
So: You're fourteen.

ANGELA
Yep.

She swings a little more.

ANGELA
When'd you get out?

Of prison.

ROY
I'm not dead. I'm in antiques.

ANGELA
That's what the doctor said. On
the phone. When he said that, Mom
started to laugh.

Roy glances about, anxious.

ROY
You -- you hungry?
(as she shrugs)
Do you mind eating? It's just --
I'd feel better somewhere indoors.
I get uncomfortable sometimes
being outside.

She gives him a curious look.

INT. SAN PEDRO DINER 53

Angela is served an enormous meal (turkey, mashed and
gravy, chocolate shake), and Roy takes note from across
the table.

ROY
I thought you weren't hungry.

ANGELA
You're gonna get wet, might as
well go swimming.

I could have bulimia. That's when
you go in the bathroom after and

She continues to eat. Roy studies her face.

ANGELA
You're staring.

ROY
Sorry.

ANGELA

That's okay. I used to do it,
too. Look at your picture and see
if I got your nose or your eyes.
Mom used to say I got lucky and
only got your elbows.

ROY
How is your mom?

ANGELA
Fine.

Roy waits: Is there more information forthcoming?
Angela eats, deliberately: No, there isn't.

ROY
So you're in school, right?

ANGELA
Not now. It's summer.

ROY
Right. Well, school's real
important. If I had anything to
do over again, I'd work harder in
school.

ANGELA
You drop out?

Roy hesitates, then nods.

ANGELA
That why you ended up a criminal?

She takes a long, noisy slurp from her shake, sucking up

ANGELA
It's okay, you know. Whatever you
do. Everybody's done something
bad in their life --

ROY
-- I'm in antiques --
ANGELA

-- if you make it a career, it's just
a lot of something strung together --

ROY
Cut the shit, huh? I'm not a
criminal.

Sorry. I shouldn't've --
ANGELA

What -- what was that word?
‘Shi...t'?
(unfazed)

When's the last time you saw each
other, you and Mom?

ROY
Before you were born.

ANGELA
You still love her?

He doesn't know how to answer.

ANGELA
‘Cause she still hates you, you know.

ROY
Yeah. I pretty much figured that.
INT. HIS CAPRICE - MOVING 54

EXT. HEATHER'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 55

Roy pulls over. Time to say good-bye. He doesn't know
how.

ANGELA
Got a pen?

He does. She takes it, then his hand, and writes a
telephone number on his palm.

ANGELA
This is my private line. Mom got
it for me for my birthday. ‘Cause

my friend Carrie kept on calling
after midnight. Maybe we could go
bowling some time.

Roy is caught off-guard by the suggestion. Angela leaps
out, then leans back in.

ANGELA
Nice meeting you, Dad.

She closes the door. Roy watches her skate away, then
glances at the number written on his palm. It absolutely
bewilders him.
FRANK (V.O.)

What's more important than family?

ROY
Huh?

FRANK

You're smiling. You switch

Pills working?

Glad one of us is happy.

ROY

(moment's thought, then)
How much money you think we could

astonishment)
Figure I owe you one.

Frank can't believe it. He stares at Roy. Then back on
the phone:

FRANK
Mr. Schlickling? Hi, I'm sorry: you
waited too long, no prize for you.

And he hangs up.

EXT. CAR WASH - DAY 57

CHUCK FRECHETTE -- swarthy, forty-something, new-money

FRANK
It's a gentlemen's --
ROY
I know what it is. What's he do?
FRANK
Import/export.
ROY

He's not connected, is he?

FRANK
He and the mob are like this --

Frank holds two fingers far apart. Meanwhile,
Frechette's MERCEDES is as dry as it's gonna get. He
gets in and PEELS AWAY, leaving his dryer's upturned palm
empty.

He hangs up. A KNOCK at the door. Roy looks alarmed.

He just got off the phone with Frank -- who else could
that be?

AT FRONT DOOR

Opening on Angela, backpack and skateboard at her feet.

ANGELA
Remember me?

Roy nods, bemused.

ROY
You just in the neighborhood?

ANGELA
Took the bus. Think I could come
in a sec?

Panic flickers across Roy's face. No one but Frank has
crossed this threshold in many years. He opens the door
wider and she steps inside. She peers about.

ANGELA
Nice.

ROY
Huh?

ANGELA

It's nice. Your place. I bet
you're wondering how I got your
address.
He wasn't.

Off your car insurance, in your

Normally I go to Carrie's. Only
her family's on vacation. And I
thought, since we seemed to hit it
off so good last time --

(hoping Roy will

complete the thought;

he doesn't)

ROY

You wanna stay here?

ANGELA
I could pay you back by cleaning
up or something --
(as she gazes around
spotless room; then re:

You wear those to read? They make

He smiles, sheepishly.

ROY
There's a couch. If you want to
sit. Or there if you prefer. Or
the couch.

She moves to the couch, amused by his nervousness; of
course, she treads right across the carpet. Roy averts
his eyes, starts for the door...

ROY
You want me to pick up anything on
the way back? Ice cream?

ANGELA

New York Super Fudge Chunk.

Older.

How long's he been inside?

Twenty minutes.

ROY
You got your lines down?

FRANK
You got my money?

Roy withdraws the standard white envelope from his jacket
and flings it at Frank.

INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT 68
As glamorous an establishment as you might imagine. Roy
enters, pays the cover charge at the door and spots -- by
way of a mirror -- Chuck Frechette drinking alone at the

bar. He finds himself a table.

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 69
While Roy's away, Angela snoops. Here she opens drawers:

nothing here, not even dust. But from this perch, the
ceramic horse in the corner draws her attention.

INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT 72
As Roy sips a club soda:

STRIPPER
Good evening.

His eyes stray up to hers (who knows the last time he
faced a bare midriff) --

STRIPPER
Care for a dance?

-- then flash to the door as Frank enters. Frank spots
Roy and heads his way. Roy glances back at the bar:
Frechette, eyes on the girls, didn't notice Frank enter.

ROY
Not just now.

The Stripper departs, passing Frank.

FRANK
Thanks, honey. Come back later
for me, though, okay?

Frank stands over Roy and extends his hand.

FRANK
Arden. Hope I didn't keep you.

ROY
(rising to shake)
Good to see you, Bob.
(voice dropping)
At the bar. He missed you come
in.

Frank nods, then whistles to a passing waitress, loudly:

FRANK
Hey, can I get a Bud?!

who recognizes Frank.

Let's sit.

They do. Frechette starts off his barstool toward them.
Roy monitors his approach.

FRANK
We in business?

ROY
On my next drink.

Another stripper passes, and Roy's distracted an instant.

FRANK
I told you you'd like it here.

Roy picks up his drink, cueing Frank to reach into his
windbreaker, remove the white envelope, and drop it on
the table --

FRANK
Don't spend it all on one girl,
huh?

-- so that it lands just as Frechette arrives, tie tugged
loose, whiskey in hand.

FRECHETTE
Hey, Bob...

FRANK
(he turns)
Hey, Chuck, I didn't know you were
here.

Frank stands to shake hands, but Frechette's eyes drop to
the white envelope on the table: a slim stack of $100's

peeks out from within. Roy notes Frechette's glance and

quickly palms the envelope into his lap.

FRANK
(awkwardly)
Ah, Chuck Frechette, this is my
friend, Arden --
Roy shoots Frank a look: no names. Frank shuts up.

at Frank: get him out of here.

FRANK
(to Frechette,
confidentially)
Say, Chuck, we got a little
business to settle up here. You
mind if --

Frechette gets the idea fast: something not-quite-legal
is going down here, and he's not welcome.

FRECHETTE
Sure, Bob. I'1l be over at the
bar.
FRANK
Great. Thanks.
FRECHETTE
(to Roy)

Nice meeting you.

Frechette retreats, curiosity piqued. Frank sits back
down.

FRANK
Fish in a barrel.

Roy waits until Frechette has returned to his barstool
and is clandestinely watching and then --

FRECHETTE'S POV

-- he removes the manila envelope from his coat and hands
it to Frank/"Bob": a trade.

BACK WITH ROY AND FRANK

As Frank glances inside Roy's manila envelope (filled
with British pounds), Roy glances at Frechette, whose

attention jerks back to the girls.

Frank.

INT. SUPERMARKET - AT FREEZER - NIGHT 73

Roy picks his way through various cartons of ice cream.
Squints through his fogged glasses, then remembers he
does not need them.

AT SAME CHECK-OUT - NIGHT 74

A carton of New York Super Fudge Chunk makes its way down
the conveyor to join a few more cans of tuna. The Check-
Out Woman adds a pack of Winstons to the bunch.

CHECK-OUT WOMAN
Big night planned?

ROY
Huh? Oh, it's not for me.

CHECK-OUT WOMAN
Right. You have kids overnight?

Roy laughs at the absurdity of this. The Check-Out Woman
doesn't understand, of course, but she laughs with him.

You'd have to ask her.

ANGELA
I did. She didn't want to talk
about it. Called you names.
That's why we got into a fight.

Roy smiles. Touched she stuck up for him.
ANGELA
She said you were a bad guy. You
don't seem like a bad guy.

ROY
That's what makes me good at it.

He rises, heads to his room, and just before he turns off
the living room light, Angela rolls over under her
blanket, eyes closed, murmuring:

I don't think you're a bad guy.

Roy smiles, shuts the light off. Immediately: KNOCK-

Roy and Frank huddle on the sidewalk, Roy out of doors

FRANK
The second you left the place, he
was off his barstool. He's in.
Oh, man, is he in. He wants to

slightly: is Angela spying?

ROY
Push it to tomorrow. Lunch. Let

anything? I realize this is
sudden, Roy, and you may feel
unprepared, but trust me, they’re
not so difficult, kids. Most of
all you have to focus on the
basics: make sure they eat their
vegetables, don 't stay up too
late, and don't watch too much TV.
Otherwise just try to be as honest
and open with them as possible.

Roy eyes a picture of two little boys atop Klein's desk.

ROY
As honest and open as possible.

She's your daughter, Roy. Unless
there's another ex-wife you
haven't told me about, she's the
only one you got.

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY/GARAGE - DAY 82

Roy pulls home, pushing a pill from its packet,
swallowing it dry, his second dose of the day. He gets
out to find --

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 83

Angela lies by the pool on a beach towel in a bikini and
dark glasses, reading a magazine.

ANGELA
How'd the meeting go? Did it go
okay?

Confronted by his daughter's breasts, hips and calves,
Roy walks straight into the house.

ANGELA
What's the matter? You freaking
out about something?

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 84

Squash, broccoli, artichokes, cauliflower, etc. Standing
behind a cart, Roy stares at them blankly.

In the frozen food aisle, Roy reads directions on a
package of frozen spinach. Angela appears behind him,
carrying chips, cookies, and a six-pack of beer.

ROY
Who's that for?

ANGELA
Don't you drink?
ROY
(shakes his head)
Do you?

ANGELA
Come on. I'm fourteen.

Roy isn't sure which way to take that.

ROY

This one's better.
INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 86
Roy cooks. His first attempt in years.
He serves. Limp spinach and sauceless spaghetti. Seated
at his breakfast table, neither he nor Angela look too
ecstatic about digging in.
He surrenders. A pizza delivery box takes center stage
on the breakfast table; the spinach and pasta lie
untouched in the kitchen sink. Angela bites into a slice
as Roy forks a fresh can of tuna.
INT. ROY'S HALLWAY - MORNING 87
The morning ritual begins again. Roy, dressed, leaves
his bedroom, closes its door behind him, proceeds to the

bathroom door, opens it --

ANGELA (0.S.)
Just a minute.

Roy closes it fast.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY 88

Roy cleans his coffee mug/wipes down the sink/waits.
He's pissed his morning routine has been interrupted.

INT. ROY'S HALLWAY - DAY 89

Angela exits, in a towel, allowing Roy to enter --

INT. ROY'S BATHROOM - DAY 90

It looks like a circus act of seals has come and gone.
Water everywhere, used towels, underpants hanging from a
faucet. Roy uses a piece of toilet paper to remove them.

Roy, bespectacled again, sits at a table with Frank and
Frechette, who are halfway through lunch. Roy sticks
with just coffee.

ROY
Bob tells me you're a yachtsman.

FRECHETTE
Hardly. Just a forty-two footer I
take out on weekends. You sail?

ROY
I get seasick in the tub.
FRANK
Arden, you sure you don't want
something?
ROY

Thanks. I gotta fly in two hours.
(To Frechette)
The cast iron stomach again.

FRECHETTE
Where you off to?

ROY

Phoenix. A client's setting up a
funding account to bridge the
pound and the euro, I've got to
hold his hand.

(to passing waitress)
Hon: could you heat this up a
little, please?

FRECHETTE
That bad, huh?

ROY
For some folks, money is a foreign
film without subtitles. Anyway,
to the business at hand.

FRANK
To the business at hand.

ROY
I have one rule, Chuck: simple is

Five thousand pounds sterling.
One of the perks of working in the

FRECHETTE

ROY
No one's in particular. Justa
little money unaccounted for,
floating on top the books like a
layer of cream.

FRANK
And he just scoops it off.

ROY
It's a little more complicated
than that but again: simple is
safe.

FRECHETTE
Why not keep the money yourself?

ROY

As a bank employee any attempt I
make to change currency is
recorded and questioned. Bob has
a record. You, on the other hand,
no one bats an eye.

Now I hope you have something for
me.

nods, removes an envelope from his jacket and

reaches it under the table.

FRECHETTE
Five grand American.

Roy checks, pockets Frechette's money.

ROY
Congratulations. At today's

Roy goes off-book.

ROY
You have a daughter?

FRECHETTE
Two. Fifteen and twelve.

ROY
I have a fourteen-year-old.

FRECHETTE
It's a riot, huh? Training bras
hanging from your shower rod...

ROY

How do you get ‘em out of the

Frank reacts: what the hell is Roy talking about?

Stiffing his valet, Frechette drives his Mercedes away.
Frank and Roy watch him go. Frank sighs in relief.

FRANK
For a second I thought we were out
two grand.

ROY
You gotta spend money to make
money.

FRANK
But you gotta make it to spend it.

Roy hesitates, then:

EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT 95
Roy can be seen through the blinds, watching the pool,
turning its light on and off.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 96
An ashtray overflows on the coffee table. Roy waits on

the couch and lights a fresh one. He checks his watch:
it's late. A dull THUNK comes from the back of the

house.

INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT 97

As Roy opens the door: Angela is brushing off her jeans.
The window is open.

ROY
Where have you been?

Nowhere.

ANGELA
I told you, the arcade --

ROY
Why'd you sneak back in?

ANGELA
That's how I left. I don't have
keys to lock the door.

ROY
You didn't see my car?

Roy squats to pluck up specks of dirt Angela tracked in.

ANGELA
Jeez, you're worse than Mom.

ROY
Listen, Angela: I'm glad we met,
but I've got a business, a
partner, and I've got things a
certain way, and that's it. Sol
think it would be better, for you
most of all, if tomorrow morning I
took you back home.

Roy brushes the dirt into a trash can.

ANGELA
What did I do wrong?

ROY
You didn't do anything wrong.

ANGELA
I just went out. I didn't drink,
I didn't get high, and I didn't

Roy slides the head off his ceramic horse, checks his

As he counts it, FOOTSTEPS march down the hall,
punctuated by the front DOOR SLAMMING. Roy looks up.
Should he go after her? He turns back to his money: it
looks all there.

EXT. ROY'S STREET - NIGHT 99
Angela stalks away from Roy's house, book bag and

skateboard in hand. Roy emerges far behind her and runs
to catch her. She, meanwhile, mounts her board.

ROY
Angela! I wasn't kicking you out.
ANGELA
I don't want to stay where I'm not
wanted.
ROY
It's not that I don't want you.
ANGELA
Fooled me.
ROY

Will you stop?
He catches her.

ANGELA

Let me go.

(as he does)
You just don't want me going home
to Mom saying she was right all

boyfriends: I'm just something
you have to deal with in order to
screw her.

Roy takes his hand out of his coat pocket to wipe a tear
off her cheek. She recoils.

ROY
Will you come back home with me?
We can get pizza again.
She won't budge.
ROY
You can stay the whole weekend if

She won't budge. Roy doesn't know what else to offer

Why do you have a gun?

Roy stops.

ROY
I want to play this for the
drawing on the twenty-second.

CASHIER
You know the odds of the lottery
hitting the same numbers in the
same month, the same numbers ever?

ROY

That's why I changed one.

You're wasting your dollar.

You his financial advisor?
CASHIER

No.

No. You're a cashier at a 7-Eleven.

ANGELA
I've got longer nails.

Roy watches her scratch away with all her might.

ROY

Just the... right.
(beat)

Okay. Most important thing you
have to understand about this game
is: ninety percent of it is
variable. No matter how good your
plan is, you almost always get
thrown a curveball. So you have
to be flexible, prepared to roll
with anything. The one thing you
can control, though, is who your
mark is. That's your ten percent.

It's for yesterday's drawing.
That says the second, don't you

Angela inspects it, too: thanks to her and Roy's
handiwork, the date looks like the second, not the
twenty-second.

ANGELA
Probably a loser.

The Housewife nods, and Angela continues on her way. But
on second thought:

HOUSEWIFE
We should at least see if it hit.

lonesome without her.

Roy considers her as she bags his groceries.

ROY
I'll see you tomorrow.
(hesitates, then)
It's Kathy, right?
(off her nod)
I'm Roy.

KATHY (CHECK-OUT WOMAN)
Hi, Roy.

They shake. Two people meeting after seeing each other
every day for months.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 117

Roy walks through the terminal.

INT. TERMINAL LOUNGE - DAY 118

Before noon, the place is mostly deserted. One or two
layovers at the bar and a custodian vacuuming the floors.
Roy and Frank case the place. Roy, a standard-sized
black briefcase beside him, withdraws a cigarette; Frank
bums one from him.

FRANK
He said he wants to fly the money
straight to the Caymans. Afraid
he might get robbed.

ROY
As if someone would do that.
When's his flight?

Where do you think?

Roy points at...

LEATHER BANQUETTE

Roy sits facing the bar, against a wall, the standard-
sized black briefcase beside him.

ROY
You plant this before the meet.
And keep the table free. I'm
here, you sit him there, back to
the bar. Otherwise we blow it

off.
FRANK
Who's the drunk gonna be?
ROY
Ernie.
FRANK
Typecasting.
ROY
What do you expect for fifty
bucks?

Frank scans the place once more, a little nervous.

FRANK
There's only one problem.
(as Roy waits: what?)
I think I'm in love with you.

Frank lets out a whoop! He's going to be rich.

SAME SCENE - LATER 119

Roy stands alone in the middle of the lounge, looking
from table to bar, then to all the walls. Running the
plan over in his head.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY 120

Summer school lets out. Roy scours the young teens
flooding from the school from his Caprice across the
street.

She grins even wider. Roy blanches dramatically: Uh-oh.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY 121

Uh-oh was right. Angela lifts a bowling ball up to her
eyes, then lets it rip down an alley -- CRASH!

Meanwhile, Roy cleans his ball meticulously with his
handkerchief -- even the finger holes. It's his turn to
bowl now and, with a swallow for courage, he plunges his
fingers into the ball to pick it up. Angela passes him
on the way back to her seat.

ANGELA
I own you.

Roy glares at her, then steps up to the alley.
Concentrates. Approaches and releases his first roll.
Gutter ball. Keeping his chin high, he retreats to the
ball return.

ANGELA
(approaching
him gently)
Dad. The first thing you have to
understand about this game is:
ninety-percent of it is knocking
down at least one pin.

He grabs at her, and she screams with laughter. And just
then -- BEEP BEEP BEEP -- it's Roy's PAGER going off. He
checks it, sighs.
ANGELA

You want me to bowl for you?
AT PAY PHONE
Roy thinks about wiping the receiver down, but his
handkerchief has already gone dirtier places. Over the

MUSIC and CRASHING PINS, he yells:

Roy's face falls. Angela, bowling in the distance, rolls
a strike and leaps in the air.

INT. FRANK'S MUSTANG - DAY A122

Frank's on a cellular headset, rubbing his temples,
stressed.

FRANK
I know, I know, he bumped it up.
He says he won't be back for a
month.

I don't want to lose him, Roy.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY B122
Now Roy's stressed, too.

ROY
There's no time. I gotta get the
money, change, get Ernie... What

Roy's face falls. Angela, bowling in the distance, rolls
a strike and leaps in the air.

EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY 122

Roy exits, in a rush, and Angela trudges out behind,
pissed.

ROY
I'm sorry. It just came up. I
gotta take you home.

You want me to take the bus?

ROY
No. shit!

He doesn't know what to do.

ANGELA
Is it a job?
Roy nods.
ANGELA
(timidly)

Can I help?

Roy considers her, thinks, then:

ROY
Yes.
ANGELA
(excitedly)
Really?
Roy nods, unhappily.
ANGELA

What do I get to do?
Roy thinks. Is this the worst idea he's ever had?
ROY
Shit!

Roy, with standard-sized black briefcase, enters with

Roy and Angela approach the Clerk.
ROY
I'd like access to my safe deposit
box. J-215.
CLERK
(offering form)
Signature and pass code, please.

Roy starts to fill it out. Covers the pass code from
Angela's prying eyes. In whispers:

ANGELA
Why can't I see?

ROY
‘Cause it's a secret.

ANGELA
Then why does he get to?

Roy thinks. To the Clerk:
ROY
Can I add an access signature to
my account.

The Clerk nods, puts forth another form. Roy pushes it
toward Angela.

CLERK
Sign here and here.

ROY
Do it.

She does. Back to whispers:
ANGELA
So, what, now I can get into the

whatever-it-is?

ROY
No. You don't have the pass code.

Oh.

ROY

Don't weep for me too much. Now
wait here. I mean it.

125 INT. PRIVATE VIEWING ROOM 125

Roy opens his deposit box. Inside are bound, neat stacks
of hundred dollar bills and hundred-pound notes, piled
atop a fist-high ream of bonds. He starts picking up
stacks of cash and placing them in the black briefcase.

He closes the case, feels its weight. Then, to the guard
around the corner:

ROY
Hey: you got today's Times?
126 EXT. FIRST FEDERAL BANK - PARKING LOT

Roy exits with Angela.

ANGELA
How much is in there?
ROY
(re: briefcase)
I told you.
ANGELA

(re: bank)
No, in there. Three hundred
thousand?
He just smiles: not telling.

ANGELA
Five hundred thousand? A million?

He shrugs. Angela is flabbergasted.

ANGELA
How did you --
ROY
I've been doing this a long time.
ANGELA
Why aren't you -- why don't you go
live in Hawaii? Why don't you buy
Hawaii?
ROY
I told you: I don't like the
outdoors.

127 INT. CAPRICE (AIRPORT PARKING LOT)
Roy puts on his Arden glasses.

He gives her two hundreds from his wallet.

ROY
Take this. Just in case.

ANGELA
Stop worrying about me. I'm
barely even doing anything.

He gives the whole plan one more thought. Shakes his
head. She looks at him with puppy eyes.

ROY
What?

ANGELA
Please, can I have the pass code?

He has to laugh.

128 INT. TERMINAL LOUNGE 128

Roy enters, carrying the black briefcase, and immediately
he spots a problem: Frank sits in the banquette seat Roy
should have. Roy continues his approach, clasping his
back now and wincing. Frank and Frechette greet him.

FRANK
Arden, you okay?

ROY
My back. Strained it last night.

FRANK
I told you: You should do yoga.

ROY
(a joke)
I was doing yoga. You mind if I
sit there. The high back helps.

Frank and Roy change seats, Roy sneaking a reproachful
glance Frank's way: nice fucking job. As he sits, with
difficulty:

ROY
How are both of you?

Across the lounge, Angela peeks out from behind a
partition to watch Roy, Frank and Chuck. A waitress
delivers Roy a club soda and departs.

FRANK
So: who goes first?

Roy and Frechette face off: who will make the first
move?

ROY
I suppose ladies do. The Queen
before Ben Franklin.

Roy lifts his black briefcase onto an empty chair between
them and cracks it open just enough for Frechette to see:
a newspaper. Frechette pries underneath: wall-to-wall
British pounds inside.

FRECHETTE
That's eighty thousand? It looks
like less than I thought.

ROY
It always does.

Frechette reaches in to flip through a stack of bills:
they're all real.

FRECHETTE
Sorry. Had to check.

ROY
As long as you don't mind.

Roy closes the case and sets it down on the floor by his
feet. Meanwhile, Frechette replaces it with a gym bag.
As he unzips it, Roy steals a glance at the lounge
entrance: Angela is entering.

FRECHETTE
Go ahead. Do your worst.

Roy explores the gym bag: it's loaded with stacks of
hundred dollar bills.
ROY
(to Frank)
You count it?

Frank nods. A pregnant pause. Then:

ROY
It looks like we have a trade.

FRANK
God bless America.

FRECHETTE
Land that I love.

Roy salutes him with his soda, and Frank and Frechette
raise their Scotches to toast --

ROY
Enjoy the Caymans. Don't get too
much sun.

FRANK

You kidding? He's going there for
the shelter.

Suddenly, from the bar:

ANGELA (0.S.)
Oh, come on! I'm twenty-one!

Roy peers up and Frank and Frechette turn to look:
Angela is screaming at the lounge bartender.

ANGELA
My I.D. is in my luggage! My
plane doesn't leave for thirty
minutes! Can't I get a goddamn
beer?!

The bartender cautions her and she grabs a tumbler --

ANGELA
You touch me, I'll break every
glass in this place.

-- then hurls the GLASS down at the floor, SHATTERING it,
drawing every eye, including Frechette's, and that's when
Roy pulls the switch: the briefcase stowed beneath the
banquette for the identical one by his feet. Lightning
fast.

ANGELA
Hey, you! Airport bartender!

Angela backs out of the lounge, arms raised, giving the
finger with both hands to the bartender. And she's gone.
Frechette turns back, none the wiser. Frank knows, of
course -- Angela's tantrum was part of the act -- and he
looks at Roy incredulously.

FRECHETTE
Hope she isn't on my flight.
Speaking of which: it's about
that time. Who goes first?

ROY
You do. Just get up and take your
new briefcase with you. When I
leave, I'll take my new gym bag.

FRECHETTE
Simple is safe.

Roy nods to his wisdom, then pushes the briefcase at his
feet across to Frechette. Frechette picks it up, bids
Frank and Roy farewell --

FRECHETTE
Guys. Let's do it again some
time.

ROY

Have a safe flight.
-- and departs. Roy and Frank watch him go.
FRANK

(under his breath)
What the hell was that?

ROY
Go with him.

Roy reaches under the banquette and grabs the briefcase

there. A bag in one hand, the case in the other, he
takes off in the opposite direction.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 129

Roy exits briskly, crossing to the parking garage.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY A130

Roy emerges from a stairwell and Angela leaps from behind
a pillar to surprise him.

ANGELA
Boo!

Roy keeps walking, despite a minor cardiac, all business
as Angela bounces around him.

ANGELA
Did you see that old chick at the
bar? With all the makeup? She
almost died when I threw that
glass.

ROY
I saw her.

ANGELA
What happened on our end? You

He nods.

He looks at her, and she smiles: just joking. He's not

ANGELA
Do I get a cut?

ROY
You can ask Frank for his.

Roy stops behind a minivan pulling out of a spot, and he
turns to see:

-- the stairwell door fly open and Frechette appear, ina
fury, suitcase open and empty, looking this way and that.
He spots Roy instantly and starts toward him.

Roy punches the gas, around the minivan and away.

ANGELA
(oblivious to
Frechette)
Dad?!

Roy races down levels of parking lot as Frechette chases
on foot. With a fair lead, the Caprice comes to four
gated exit lanes, two cars in the three of them, one car
in the fourth. Roy chooses that one.

ANGELA
(frightened now)
Dad?

ROY
Roll up your window! Now! Get
down on the floor!

Angela does as she's told. His money ready, Roy waits
for the car ahead of him to pass through, but the
ATTENDANT seems to be taking forever to make change.
Meanwhile, the other lanes are clearing up quickly. Roy
considers backing up and choosing another exit, but the
minivan he passed now hovers behind him. He's trapped.

And Frechette appears in his sideview mirror, hustling
toward him. At last, Roy pulls up to the parking
Attendant, thrusts his money at her, then barks:

Roy hits the gas, and the Caprice slaps the gate as it
rises, but before they're clear, Frechette gets a clean
look at Angela hovering below the seat.

ROY

wheel)
Dammit!

No reply. Roy just seethes.

Located in the rear of a discount drugstore. Five people
stand on line for the white-coated, white-haired
PHARMACIST. Roy joins the back of the line, wild-eyed,
wild-haired, impatient.

ROY
C'mon, c'mon.

A few customers look back at Roy. He stares their
glances away. Soon he can wait no longer. He pushes to
the front of the line, empty packet in hand.

ROY
Hi, I need a refill of this. I
don't have a prescription, but --

PHARMACIST

Sir, please, wait your turn --
ROY

I know, but this is an

emergency !--

MAN IN LINE
Hey, buddy: ever hear of a line?

ROY
(turning)
Ever been dragged onto the
sidewalk and beaten till you piss
blood?

That decides it: nobody's screwing with Roy. The
Pharmacist scans the horizon for security, doesn’t see
anyone.

ROY
Please. I need a refill.

PHARMACIST
Do you have a prescription?

ROY
My shrink, my doctor, he gave me
these. They're samples of -- I
can't remember -- Prefex-
something.

PHARMACIST
I'm sorry. Without a
prescription!--

ROY
Look: I have the packet --

PHARMACIST
I can't help you, sir.

ROY
-- So I'm clearly allowed to have
them. I just need four or five of
these to cover the weekend.

PHARMACIST
(resigning)
Let me see it.

The Pharmacist takes the empty packet from Roy. Studies
it. Hands it back.

PHARMACIST
Those are vitamins.
ROY
What?
PHARMACIST
That packet contained vitamins.
ROY
No. My doctor gave it to me.
Prefex...
PHARMACIST

They're vitamins, sir. Supplifen.
Aisle four.

Roy stands there, incredulous, infuriated.
In aisle four, he rips open a box of Supplifen to find
the replica of the packet he was given. He crushes it.
EXT. KLEIN'S OFFICE - NEXT MONDAY 149
Klein exits his sedan. Fumbling for his office key, he
approaches the front door when Roy appears in the
breezeway behind him, shoulders heaving, threatening.
Klein gasps, startled, then:
DR. KLEIN
Roy? I'm not supposed to see you
‘till --

Klein appraises Roy: he is not to be trifled with right
now.

INT. KLEIN'S OFFICE 150

Klein enters with Roy, turns on a light.

DR. KLEIN
Would you like to sit?
ROY
I am sitting.
A beat.
DR. KLEIN
Roy: why do you think you need
medication?
ROY

You are not asking questions yet.
First you answer: did you give me

vitamins?

DR. KLEIN
Yes.

ROY
Why?

DR. KLEIN

Because you don’t need medication.

ROY
Look at me. I'm a mess.

DR. KLEIN

Agreed. But you weren't a mess
last week, and you weren't on
Prefexall then either.

(beat)
I have news for you, Roy. Your
neurosis is small-time. Your
conscience is another story.

(before Roy retorts)
Let me ask a question. Does what
you do make you happy?

ROY
Don't change the subject.

DR. KLEIN
This is the subject. What would
you do if you had to change
careers?

ROY
If I couldn't be an antiques
broker?

DR. KLEIN

If you couldn't be a criminal.
(beat)

This is a 17th Century

feet on for the last two months,
Roy. I've had computer
programmers tell me what a nice
piece it is.

ROY
I'm not a criminal. I'ma con
man.

DR. KLEIN
The difference being?

ROY
They give me their money.

DR. KLEIN
That's a nice rationalization,
Roy.

ROY

I never took anybody who didn't
let me out of greed or weakness.
I've never used violence.

DR. KLEIN
Would you say then you set an
example in your trade?

ROY
Sure.

Angela? Fine.
(as Klein waits
him out)
She wants back to her mom's.

DR. KLEIN
Have you spoken to her?
(as Roy shakes his

head)
Why not?
ROY
Do we have to talk about this?
DR. KLEIN
Why haven't you spoken?
ROY
(a beat)

Because she hates me.

DR. KLEIN
Why do you think she hates you?

Roy's face crumbles, and everything pours out:
ROY
Because I -- because I -- Oh,

girl! I lost my little girl!

You gotta do what you gotta do.
I'm sorry to lose you.

You want your forty g's?

ROY
Consider it a parting gift.

FRANK
We should part more often.

ROY
Thanks, Frank. For everything.

FRANK
Thank you, partner.

They shake hands. Frank gestures to the door.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM 153

The place is clean again. Roy opens a Radio Shack box,
pulls out a new portable phone. Reads its instructions.

INT. ROY'S BEDROOM 154
Roy sits on his bed, phone in hand. Gathering his nerve.

He twirls between his fingers the barrette he found in

his bathroom. At last, he dials. One ring, two rings.

EXT. SAN PEDRO PARK - DAY 155

Roy sits waiting. Looks up as Angela approaches on her
skateboard. Roy smiles. Angela does not.

I went to see a lawyer. He

of the child.

(off no reaction

from her)
There are things you have to do.
File paperwork, blood tests, go
before a judge. It would only be
for weekends and some holidays to
start.

Still no reaction.

ROY

I'd have to make some changes.
For one, I'm gonna have to stop
doing what I do for a living.

(as Angela stops,

turns away)
Honey, I'm sorry. I should have
asked you first.

She looks up at him, tears in her eyes, and throws her
arms around him.

ANGELA
Will you try? Please?

ROY
(soaring)
Yes. I'll try, honey. I'1l try.

He wraps his arms around her and holds her.

INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT 156

Roy and Angela celebrate, Angela in a new-bought dress,
which makes her fidget. A JAZZ COMBO PLAYS in the next

They're messy, aren't they?

ANGELA
Not if you train 'em. We can name
it Frank.

ROY

That's a good name.
They both smile. A WAITER pours Angela more Diet Coke.

WAITER
Mademoiselle...

Angela suppresses a laugh.

ON DANCE FLOOR IN NEXT ROOM

A few couples dance. Angela leads a reluctant Roy to the
floor. She holds up her arms for him to take, and he
balks.

ANGELA
Please...

He gives in. Takes her hands in his and, very
tentatively, begins to box-step. Concentrates mostly on
his feet, then remembers to concentrate on Angela. And
she, throughout, just beams.

INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 157

Dark. They enter, laughing. Angela is imitating the
French Waiter as Roy fumbles the key out of the lock.

Roy switches on a lamp, then leaps back: Chuck Frechette
is sitting on his sofa. Cigarette in hand, handgun
resting on the cushion beside him. Big smirk.

FRECHETTE
Hello, Roy. Hiya, sunshine.

Roy freezes/considers the variables: the open door
behind him, Angela before him.

FRECHETTE
Close the door.
(as Roy hesitates)
Close it.

Roy considers Frechette's gun, does as he says. Angela
trembles halfway between them.

ANGELA
Dad?

ROY
Go wait in your room, honey.

FRECHETTE
Let her stay. She's in this as
much as you are.

ROY
What do you want?

FRECHETTE
What do you think?

We haven't met, sweetie. My

FRECHETTE

FRECHETTE
Airport security cameras, Roy.
They got a nice look at her. That

ROY
There were no cameras in the

FRECHETTE
No. But there were in the gift

And suddenly it dawns on Roy, and his eyes drop down to
the coffee table, to the "I Love LA" ashtray atop it.
Angela's gift. Frechette extinguishes his cigarette in

it.

Frechette

In my business you need a few

FRECHETTE

Angela gasps. Frank meets Roy's stare with helpless,
horrified eyes. Roy blanches.

FRECHETTE
You look white as a ghost, Roy. I
don't want you to pass out before
you make your first payment. But
first things first. Let's have
back the money you took from me.

ROY
I don't have it.
FRECHETTE
Then let's start with what you do

have.

Again Roy eyes the gun, his daughter.

ROY
Four thousand. Maybe.
FRECHETTE
Where?
ROY

(staring toward it)
The horse.

FRECHETTE
No. Let her get it.

Roy stops. Angela looks up at him, frightened. He nods:
it'll be okay. She moves toward the horse. Takes its
head off, starts scooping out money.

FRECHETTE
Next: I'm in for half of what you
make from now on. Otherwise, I
call those cop friends of mine,
your little girl goes to juvie

Frank doesn't say a word. His eyes are fixed on
something. Frechette follows his stare to --

Angela, standing by the horse, Roy's .38 in her hands
leveled at him. Everyone freezes, including Roy.

ROY
Angela, put it down, honey. I'11l
take care of this.

ANGELA
(fixed on Frechette,
tears in her eyes)
I want you to go.

FRECHETTE
You know how to use that thing,
sweetie?

ROY
Put it down, Angela. Don't make
it worse.

Angela doesn't budge. A standstill. Then, a small voice
behind her:

FRANK
Do it.

ROY
Quiet, Frank.

Frank stumbles to his feet, aching, bloodthirsty.
Frechette, frightened now, moves his hand toward his gun.

ANGELA
Don't.

Frechette stops. Angela looks to Roy. All their dreams
are slipping through their fingers. Roy holds her
glance, apologizing for everything.

ANGELA

Roy turns. Frechette falls off the couch, blood seeping
from his shirt. Shaking, voiceless.

ANGELA
Dad...

Angela trembles, numb. Roy goes to her.

ROY
Frank: get his gun.

Frank hobbles over to Frechette. Roy holds Angela.

ANGELA
Daddy...

ROY
It's okay. It's okay.

FRANK
Roy? He's not gonna make it.

Roy looks over: Frechette is dying. Angela sees it,
too.

FRANK
Roy? What are we going to do,
Roy?

Roy's got a lot of thinking to do very fast.

EXT. ROY'S KITCHEN DOOR/DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 158

Frank pulls Chuck's Mercedes up the driveway to the side
door where Roy exits, holding a blanket over Angela's

shoulders. He opens the passenger door for her and she
gets in, nearly catatonic. Roy speaks past her to Frank:

ROY
You know where the Seven Palms
Motel is?

FRANK

ROY
Get a room. Ground floor if you

Take him to a hospital.

Frank realizes the risk Roy is running. Roy kneels
beside Angela.

He closes

Frechette is gone. Roy drops the sheets, does a three-
sixty, looking for places he might have crawled to.
Nothing. He spins --

Frechette is leaning against the wall behind him, deathly
pale, blood dripping down his legs. He lifts his gun up
unsteadily, points it between Roy's eyes --

-- and Roy pivots away just as --

BOOM!

HIS POV 162

An air-conditioner overhead; an I.V. in his arm; an
admission bracelet around his wrist; a uniformed COP
sitting in a chair; a surveillance camera above him.

COP
You awake?

The Cop rises and goes out the door. Roy tries to lift
himself onto one side, can't -- he's handcuffed to a bed
railing. He pokes at a bandage wrapped around his head.

He looks around the room: Spartan, antiseptic, an open
door to a mini-bathroom. He is --

IN HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Tiny. One bed, no TV, bars on the windows. The door
opens again, and two detectives (BISHOP and HOLT) come

BISHOP
You were given a pretty close
haircut the other night, Roy.
This little fella took out about
half an inch of your skull.

Bishop offers a couple of head X-rays. Roy can barely
sit up much less study X-rays. Bishop drops them.

BISHOP
You got lucky, Roy. Wish we could
say the same for Chuck.

Roy remembers slowly, wisely keeps his mouth shut.

ROY
Am I under arrest?

Roy peers through the open blinds as an intern checks his
vitals. From the bed, he can't see anything but a

freeway in the distance. Bishop and Holt return with Dr.
Klein in tow, a little agitated. The intern departs.

ROY
Hey, Doc.
DR. KLEIN
Hello, Roy.
(to Bishop)

May I sit down?
Bishop nods, and Klein takes a seat by the bed.

DR. KLEIN
How are you feeling?

Roy looks. Bishop, Holt and the cop haven't moved.

ROY
Can we have a little privacy?

BISHOP
That's not how it works, Roy.

Don't I have doctor-patient rights

Holt laughs.

Five minutes.

off the bed. For the first time in days, he stands, a
little wobbly, in nothing but a hospital gown.

eyes go wide. Dumbfounded, he moves down a brief hallway,

Blinding sunlight. Roy's hospital room resides within a

Roy can't believe it. He staggers around the trailer, to
the roof's edge, and looks down. The parking structure
overlooks a largely-deserted stretch of Los Angeles.

Roy feels his bandage again. Starts to unwrap it. Then
pulls it clean off. Gingerly feels about his skull. No
stitches, no fracture, no bullet hole. Just one mother

Roy gives his pass code to the Clerk. He wears the same
clothes and the same distant stare.

FRANK (V.O.)

‘But you always said if I gota
shot at a big score, I should take
it.’

INT. BANK VAULT 179

Roy's box is removed. Large but no longer heavy. Roy
touches his head wound.

FRANK (V.O.)
‘Sorry about the rubber bullet, by
the way. And for everything
else.'

INT. PRIVATE VIEWING ROOM 180

Roy sets the box on a table, pries off the lid,
revealing --

FRANK (V.O.)
‘If it's any consolation, you're
the best I ever saw. I'd never
find a better partner. Now I
won't have to.'

-- a single, thin stack of $100s.

FRANK (V.O.)
‘Enjoy the gift. Frank.'

EXT. UNDER HIGHWAY SIGN 181
BLASTING UNDER a highway sign: "SAN PEDRO," then DOWN
TO...

Roy's Caprice, Roy at the wheel. All four windows rolled
down, creating a windstorm inside his car.

EXT. HEATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 182
For the first time, Roy parks in front of the house. He
staggers to the front door and knocks, running on the

slenderest of hopes.

A moment passes before the door opens, and Heather stands
before him. They share a long moment of recognition.

HEATHER
Roy...

He looks numb, glass-eyed. He can barely speak.

ROY
She's not here, is she?

HEATHER
What?
ROY
Angela?
HEATHER

(at a complete loss)
Who? Roy, what are you talking

about -- ?
ROY

The baby! You were gonna have a

baby!

Heather is aghast.

HEATHER

That's -- that's why you're here?
ROY

You were pregnant.
She nods.

ROY
You were.

Tears come to her eyes, too, a painful memory.

His last hope dashed, all the revelations of the day come
to a point, and Roy crumbles. He gasps for air, clutches
his gut, and folds into himself.

HEATHER
Roy, Roy: you okay?

Heather stands helpless before him, then slowly --
because of their history, or despite it -- reaches out
and caresses him.

FADE OUT.
FADE IN:

EXT. BEHIND CARPETERIA - DAY 184

Roy on a smoke break.

MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 10/7/02 119-120.

CONTINUED: 184
His salesman's uniform is not terribly different from his
old costume, and he still wears his hair in a completely
unremarkable fashion, but his bearing has changed: he is

aman at ease. A CO-WORKER sticks his head out the back
door.

CO-WORKER
Roy: another live one.

Roy nods, flings his cigarette away, returns to work.

INT. CARPETERIA - DAY 185

Roy finds his next prospect: a twenty-year old SLACKER
flipping through Persians.

ROY
Afternoon.

(CONTINUED )
185

CONTINUED:

Roy turns.

SLACKER

(keeps flipping)
How ya doin'.

ROY
Help you with anything?
SLACKER
Yeah. I need a carpet.
ROY
For your home?
SLACKER
For my secretary's office.

(beat)
No, it's for my apartment. All
one room of it.

ROY
Big place, huh. You have a color
in mind?
SLACKER
I have a price in mind. Cheap.
ROY
So you don't need much, you don't
know what you want, but -- no

price is too low.

SLACKER
That's about me.

ROY
You're my perfect customer. Let's
dig into the remnants

SLACKER
Wait, I gotta wait. My girlfriend
knows better than I do what we need.
(off a DOOR CHIME)
That's her.

Angela enters the store. Looking nineteen at

least. Dark glasses and cutoff jeans. She comes
straight at her boyfriend, doesn't notice Roy at all.

ANGELA
What kind of pet store doesn't
carry collars? They've got dog
shampoo in there but no collars.

(CONTINUED )
122.

185 CONTINUED: (2) 185

Roy just stands there. Studying her. Making sure he's
not mistaken.

SLACKER
Then we'll go to another place.
(to Roy)

We just got a dog.

ROY
Let me guess. A Lab.

She freezes, recognizing his voice. She won't turn to
face him, while he keeps his eyes locked on her.

SLACKER
Eh. German shepherd.
ROY
My next guess.
SLACKER

There's no special carpet that
dogs like, is there?

A beat. Will Roy say something?
ROY
We call it Astroturf. C'mon,
remnants are back of the store.

IN BACK

Roy watches Angela and her boyfriend flip through carpet
fragments. Her attention is obviously divided.

SLACKER

I like that... I like that...
ROY

You folks just move in together?
SLACKER

Three weeks ago.
ROY

Big step.
SLACKER

You think? We only started dating
last month. If you're gonna get
wet --

ROY
-- might as well go swimming.

The Slacker laughs: that's what he was going to say.
Angela still won't face him.

SLACKER
Ooh, I really like that one.

ROY
That's a nice choice. Durable. You
barely notice stains it's so dark.

ANGELA
How much is it?

ROY
Sticker's seventy-five. But I can
knock off twenty percent if you
pay cash.

Angela and her boyfriend mull it over, under their breaths,
then agree: it's a sale. Angela dips into her purse...

He smirks

SLACKER
Our living arrangement. I pay the
rent, she buys all the carpets.

ANGELA
Shit. I think I left my... yeah,
I left my wallet in the car.
(to her boyfriend,
with a big sigh)
Can you get it for me? It
probably just fell under my seat.

at Roy -- what can he say? -- and heads off.

SLACKER
Be right back.

Roy and Angela watch him go, alone together. She turns
at last to face him. They lock eyes for a moment, then
she indicates the cigarettes in his shirt pocket.

ANGELA
Can I bum one?

EXT. BEHIND CARPETERIA 186

Roy lights Angela's cigarette, then his own.

ROY
When did you start smoking?

ANGELA
Long time ago. I was stealing
from your pack the whole time.
Surprised you didn't notice.

ROY
I was missing a lot back then.

ANGELA
You like this job?

ROY
(shrugs)
It's not that much different from
the old one really. Steadier.
Only been on it six months.

They smoke in silence. What to say?

ROY
You working this guy?

ANGELA
Nah. I'm retired. That was a
one-time deal.

ROY
No shit. You were good.
ANGELA
I had a good teacher.
(sheepishly)
Teachers.
ROY

I'm surprised to see you here.
Figured you would have moved to, I
don't know, Hawaii.

ANGELA
I had bills to pay. My mom was
real sick.

ROY
She get better?
(as Angela shakes
her head)
I'm sorry.

(CONTINUED )
125.
186 CONTINUED: (2) 186
ANGELA
I'm sorry, too. If it's any

consolation. You mad at me?

ROY
You didn't take it. I gave it to you.

She takes him in again: the new at-ease Roy.

ANGELA
Things are good with you, aren't they?

SLAM! Angela's boyfriend exits the back door.

SLACKER
There you are.

ANGELA
Just stealing a drag.

SLACKER
(empty-handed)
I looked everywhere.
She pulls out her wallet.

ANGELA
I found it. Sorry.

Her boyfriend gives her a look, and Angela gives him a
big kiss for his effort. Roy looks away.
187 EXT. CARPETERIA - FRONT - DAY 187

Roy helps the Slacker load and tie his and Angela's new
purchase onto the roof of their aging Honda Civic.

SLACKER
Thanks, man.

ROY
Enjoy it.

The Slacker gets in. For a fleeting moment, Angela and
Roy stand alone again before she gets in the car.

ANGELA
It's good to see you, Roy.

ROY
Good to see you, too.

A beat. She starts to open the car door, stops.

ANGELA
You're not gonna ask my name?
ROY
I know your name.
ANGELA
(smiles)

I'll see ya, Dad.

Then hops in the car. Roy watches the carpet-loaded
Civic pull creakily away. Looks up at the sun for a
moment before heading back into work.

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 188

Roy buys ice cream and frozen pizzas. A young man works
the check-out register.

INT. ROY'S CAPRICE -DAY 189

Driving home. Windows down. Roy keeps just one hand on
the wheel, only bringing the other up for a turn (when we
might notice: he's wearing a ring).

EXT. ROY'S HOME - DAY 190

Roy pulls his Caprice up the driveway and gets out.
Groceries in hand, he heads to the front door, unlocks
it, enters.

Turning to look inside the house: THROUGH the front
windows, for the first time open and unencumbered by
shades: Roy walks into the living room. A new carpet
replaces the old. He pays it no mind. He leafs through
mail, calls out a name, then turns as --

-- Kathy enters from the kitchen, wiping her hands clean
on a dishrag. She smiles and Roy smiles, too, explaining
what he got at the market and opening his market bag wide
for her to see. She rubs his head: nice job, then
kisses him, and he kisses back --

-- and when they break, she whispers sweetly in his ear,
and he smiles even more. He looks down to lay his palm
gently on her belly. They go into dinner.

FADE OUT.
