INT. GRIPPIN’S OPPICE - Day

No introduction, without any set up we are listening to WRITER
#1, 28, pitching a story. This is the first of four.

WRITER #1
Here's the idea for the movie.
Kevin Costner and Michelle
Pfeiffer are cops. He’s burned
out because his last partner was
just killed in a drug bust that
went bad. She's his new partner.

INT. GRIFFIN'S OFPICE - DAY
WRITER #2 is about forty, tired looking, anzious, failing.

WRITER #2
Kevin Costner and Harrison Pord
are brothers. They hate each -
other. They find a gold mine in
Borneo. And that's what the story
is, a gold mine. He open on...

INT. GRIPPIN'S OFPICE - DAY

WRITERS #3 AND #4 are a team, two singy comedy writers. They're
bouncing around the room, acting out the story, and as they do,
we see the ferson to whom they're pitching: GRIPPIN MILL, early
thirties. He gives nothing away.

And at the end he has to choose
between Geena Davis and Glenn
Close. I think he should go with
Davis, the smartest thing to do
would be to stick money in the
budget for two endings, and let
the audience decide, And I think
it would be a terrific part for

Griffin and Kahane enter. A smoky bar, fifty or so Asian men

in suits, a siew of hostesses and a piano bar, with a WOMAN
PIANIST playing Japanese standards. A drunk JAPANESE MAN holds

a microphone and sings, badly. A JAPANESE FRIEND grabs the mike
and completes the song, and he's a better singer. The men in

the room are barely paying attention. The HOSTESS comes up to
Griffin and Kahane and the writer starts talking to her in fluent
Japanese. We can see that Griffin is threatened by Kahane's
mastery. The Hostess leads them to a table, joking with Kahane.
When they're seated....

KAHANE
Beer okay?

GRIFPPIN
Beer's fine.

KAHANE

But you didn't.

Kahane gets up and walks to the piano bar. He whispers something
in Japanese to the pian.st. She's delighted by his Japanese,

and she starts to play the opening chords of “Goldfinger.” Kahane
sings the song. Everyone in the club stops talking and listens.
At one point Kahane faces Griffin and sings to him, showing off.
Griffin can't look him in the eyes.

Kahane finishes, to wild applause. Be bows to Griffin, and then
drops five dollars in the pianist's snifter, she refuses, he
makes her keep it. As Kahane leaves the bar the bad singer grabs
the microphone and in Japanese starts singing "From Russia With
Love.” Everyone in the room boos and he stops. The pianist leaves
the piano and puts on a tape.

The pianist passes Griffin. Griffin taps her ara.

GRIFFIN

He grabs Griffin's hand and takes it off his arm.

He pishes Griffin away.

done)
That was... that was... liberating.

He punches Griffin again. Now Griffin rams his shoulder into
Kahane and throws him against his car. Kahane pushes Griffin
back. Griffin sees their reflection in a window, it's like
lovers, dancers. The two men struggle.

KAHANE
Bribing writers, picking fights
in parking lots. .

And he punches Griffin again. Something changes in Griffin. He
collects his energy. He throws himself at Kahane and drags him
to the ground. They roll twice. Griffin is on the bottom, but
he has his hands on Kahane's throat. The rest happens like a
car crash, unstoppable, inevitable.

Nobody cares.
He tightens his grip.

KAHANE

The effort to say this costs Kahane the advantage, and Griffin
forces him off. They rel! again. Griffin ends up on top, sitting
on Kahane's chest. He has Kahane's elbows pinned under his knees
and his hand is around Kahane’s throat. Griffin is choking Kahane
with all of his strength now. Their eyes lock, Kahane can't quite
believe this is happening.

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 34

Griffin gets into his car. The adrenaline rush is over. He's
shaken, miserable, scared of the power he'd unleashed in himself.

He drives. But he can't drive. He's passing the theater.
He passes the sides street that leads to the parking lot.

The THEATER CASHIER has just run out to the sidewalk, and she's
screaming. Griffin slows down and opens his window.

CASHIER
Murder! Help! Murder!

Griffin, in horror, makes a slow left turn. He passes the woman.
He can see into the lot. A few people are huddled around a body
lying on the ground. Kahane.

Griffin speeds up. He has mixed emotions: fear (because he has
killed a man, and what if he gets caught?) and something else,
excitement, a thrill (he has killed a man, he has crossed a line,
and what if he gets away with it?).

black yarmulke from a basket and puts it on. :

BROTHER
Einstein said that God doesn't
play dice. I'd like to say that
we could console ourselves with
the thought that in God's plan,
David Kahsne's death is necessary
for the universe to unfold its
majestic design... .

He opens the door to the chapel.
INT. CHAPEL - DAY 5
The coffin. About thirty MOURNERS. The brother, 25, continues.

BROTHER
++» but I can't say that, because
David always laughed at mindless
faith. Someone in the night killed
him, and that person will have
to bear his guilt, and he'll never
know what he took from David's
triends and family.

 

Griffin take seat in the back row. A few people in the front
row turn to see who has come in. June looks at Griffin. She says
something to the MAN sitting next to her, who turns around to
see the last man who saw Kahane alive,

BROTHER
My brother died after seeing a
movie, which I guess is sort of
fitting. I hope you don't take
this the wrong way, but he really
loved movies, and I'm glad he
didn't die on his way in, you
know, before he saw it. That
would have hurt me a lot more
and this hurts a lot.

The pressure is too much for Griffin. He goes outside. We hear
the KADDISH from inside.

EXT, HILLSIDE MEMORIAL - DAY Se

Mourners shovel earth onto the casket in the open grave.
Pinished. People walk away. June walks to Griffin and offers

her hand.

Everyone gets up. As they're leaving, while they walk, Griffin
can sense Avery's dissatisfaction.

GRIFFIN
Something's bothering you, what
is it?

SUSAN AVERY
Did you follow David Kahane to

If I were a Pasadena homicide
detective with enough time, I'd
find out all I could about young
bucks like yourself, and when
I learned what a Walter Stuckel
knows about them, I'd call you
down to the station for another
chat.

GRIPFIN
What does a Walter Stuckel know?

WALTER STUCKEL
He knows that young bucks don't
hang out in theater lobb:es
waiting for writers. Did you know
he used to be a drug dealer?

GRIFFIN
Really?

- WALTER STUCKEL
I checked up on him. He was smart.
He didn’t put the profits up his
nose and he made a small killing
in real estate. Out of the trade
tor three years. The police don't
think his death had anything to
do with his past. You don't do
drugs anymore, do you?

I don't know you, I don't know
what your life is like, I'm sure
you've got good friends who can
help you througb this a lot better
than I can, but I think there's

a connection between us.

JUNE
I don't know if we should say
anymore, and I don‘t know exactly
how I feel right now, but there
is a connection. The night you
called, to speak to David, I had
a feeling about you, that I'd
hear from you again. I suppose
that's awful to admit, but I've
learned a lot from this, and it’s
important to say what you feel.
You can't find out what you feel
until you start to admit all your
feelings. And these feelings
change. Oh, God, I'm running at

not going to apologise.

Poor baby.

She kisses him on the cheek, like a sister. He wants more. White

spine. She drifts back to him. He reaches around and holds her
waist, and then draws his thumb up to touch the bottom of her
breast. He kisses her on the cheek and on the ear. She lowers
her head and offers her neck again.

Griffin catches Levison watching him. Levison grins. Neil Diamond

because I kept something from
you, because I didn’t tell an
old girlfriend that I'd be in
Mexico with another woman. I'm
just a guy, June. Maybe I have
a big office and a fancy car,
and I know how to wear a tuzedo
and call for a limousine, so it
looks like I have my life
together, but love confuses
everyone. I'm no esception.

GRIFFIN

This. isn't a party, Miss Avery.
PHIL BROPHY bounds into the lobby. He's in his maid-thirties,
energetic, focussed, and Griffin is a little jealous of someone
whose life has not brought him to the brink of ruin.

Griffin standing in front of the height graph painted on the
wall. There are six MEN in the lineup, three of them vaguely
Griffin's size and shape. Number S ig the COP he'd seen near
Avery's desk. They look at their reflections, and Griffin tries
to see beyond. Impossible. Griffin is number 3.

- SUSAN AVERY (V.0.)
Number one, step forward....
number five... turn sideways....
number three, step forward...

A pause. Griffin is out in front, alone, facing his reflection.

Griffin turns. Off his profile we move through the mirror. and
come back around to see him from the WITNESS’ POV. We don't see

SUSAN AVERY
The witness picked a cop.

GRIFFIN
I was thinking, you know, I was
on the street when he was killed.
And a witness to a murder might
have seen me there, and, in the
lineup, would have remembered

my face.
Walter Stuckel listens, quietly.

There you go with my defense.

INT. GAS CHAMBER - NIGHT : we

From the PRISONER'S POV: preparations for an execution. A
CHAPLAIN is reciting Psalms:

CHAPLAIN
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of Death, I fear no evil...
(etc.)

The WITNESSES are somber, looking at the prisoner inside the
chamber. The GUARDS strap the witness in: arms, legs, chest.

OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER: The EXECUTIONER prepares the cyanide
pellets. The WARDEN stands by a black phone. It RINGS. Everyone
is alert.

WARDEN
Yes, Governor... thank you
Governor.
(He puts the phone down,
and shakes his head.)
Let’s go.

The Chaplain makes the sign of the cross in front of the

prisoner. The guards and the chaplain leave the chamber. There
is an awful sound of the door being screwed shut.

ON THE EXECUTIONER

The pellets are released into the acid bath under the chair.

PRISONER'S POV:

The witnesses watch him die. THE SOUND OF THE PRISONER'S FINAL,
RASPING BREATHS. Suddenly the witnesses all look away.

OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER:

We see what they see, coming down the hall, with a shotgun in
his hand, looking crazed, is KEVIN COSTNER.

COSTNER
She didn't do it!

He BLASTS the window of the gas chamber and now we see MICHELLE

Turn on the fans!

Strong fans suck the gas out of the chamber. Pfieffer is barely
conscious, and Costner is at her side, kissing her.

PFEIFFER
What tock you so long?

COSTNER
The traffic was a bitch.

MUSIC UP as the lovers hug. It's a rough cut, and the film is
killed. The lights come up in the room, and as Griffin stands
up, applauding, we see the crew, Oakley, Civella, and Larry Levy,
in Griffin’s old seat. And this, superimposed:

Griffin is stunned. He's been living a lie. Everything he has

Griffin turns and without warning kicks the Writer in the balls.
The Writer drops his gun. The Writer is a haunted locking man,
mid-thirties, not unlike David Kahane, perhaps more intelligent
looking but not quite so much a part of the world. Griffin is
on him, and the fight is like the fight with Kahane. The same
choreography. They roll over the envelope, tearing it, money
surrounds them on the steps, there's a card in the envelope
that’s pulled out, too, we can't really read it. This time,

as Griffin chokes’ a writer, he doesn't let go. And this time,
the writer he’s choking is going to die. This time the Writer
pleads for his life.
