OVER BLACK

A MALE VOICE utters a single syllable- slowly, monotonously,
rhythmically.

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
Da... Da... Da... Da... Da...

FADE IN:

WHITE WINDOWLESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The voice belongs to DR. HARRY MCGURK. In CLOSE UP, he stares
into the camera, now repeating a DIFFERENT SYLLABLE.

MCGURK
---Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa...

Offscreen, a FRIENDLY VOICE addresses the audience.

FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
Close your eyes.

(beat)

Close them.
MCGURK

«..Da... Da... Da... Da... Da...
FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)

You hear “Da”. Now open them.
MCGURK

«Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa...

FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
You hear “Fa”. Close your eyes,
it’s “Da”. Open them, it’s “Fa”.
Weird, isn’t it?

(NOTE: This is a real neurological illusion. The McGurk
Effect. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-1N8vWm3m0 )

FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
Let’s try it a different way.

The SCREEN SPLITS into identical shots of Dr. McGurk. On the
LEFT, his mouth forms the word “Da”, on the RIGHT, “Fa”.

FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
Pick a side. I won’t tell you which
one. Is he saying Fa or Da?
(then)
(MORE )
FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Now look at the other side. What’s
he saying now?

(NOTE: Whoever looks left will hear ‘Da’ and whoever looks
right will hear ‘Fa’)

FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
The truth is that the sound hasn’t
changed- only the picture. All
we're hearing is ‘Da Da Da.’ But
when you look to the right, his
mouth forms the word ‘Fa.’ And your
poor brain, having seen lips form
this sound for your entire life is
powerless. It tells you to hear
‘fa.’ It discounts reality and
gives you what it perceives to be
true.

(then)
So what's the point of all this you
ask? It’s this- Reality is not what
you see. It’s what you think you
see.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN NYC STREET / JEWELRY STORE - DAY

AN UPTOWN WOMAN in her late thirties lingers at the window.
Liking what she sees, she waves to the MERCHANT inside. He
BUZZES her in.

MERCHANT
Good afternoon...

WOMAN
Hi. I love that necklace...
INT. JEWELRY STORE - LATER
The Woman holds up a DIAMOND AND JADE NECKLACE, smiling.

WOMAN
Oh this one’s great too.

MERCHANT
Pure Jade. Mid-century,
untreated...

She puts it on a VELVET TRAY with SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS, turns
her attention to the DISPLAY CASE.
WOMAN
What about that one...?

MERCHANT
The sautoir? Wonderful...

He opens the case and retrieves a SAUTOIR NECKLACE.

WOMAN
Ohh...

A light KNOCK at the door and the Merchant BUZZES another
CUSTOMER in. The woman holds the sautoir to her neck.

WOMAN (CONT'D)
Now this is beautiful. What do you
think?

 

The Merchant can’t help but notice how beautifully the
necklace drapes upon her cleavage.

MERCHANT
Perfect.

FRIENDLY VOICE (0.S.)
I prefer the one in your coat,
Janice.

The familiar voice belongs to NICKY SPURGEON (33), dressed in
a cheap suit worn by undercover cops and rental car agents.

He sidles up alongside her as his PARTNER- a larger,
similarly dressed man- flanks Janice on her other side.

WOMAN
(busted)
Oh fuck--
NICKY

Sorry sir, this woman’s been
working the area for about a week.

The partner starts REMOVING JEWELRY FROM THE WOMAN’S POCKETS
and putting it on the glass counter. The Merchant is shocked.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Look familiar? Yeah-

(to Partner)
Take her.

The partner whisks her off. Nicky grabs the Jade necklace
from the velvet tray.
NICKY (CONT'D)
You're an expert- is this real?

The Merchant is surprised at what he sees.

MERCHANT
That’s not mine.

NICKY
No. This one is.

Nicky picks up the real Jade necklace fished from the woman’s
pocket. He takes command of the room with an authoritative
confident tone.

NICKY (CONT'D)
That’s her scam-- while she’s
holding this here, she’s got your
focus. More pointedly- her breasts
do. Meanwhile, down here, she’s
taking a fake out of her pocket and
leaving it on the velvet. She asks
to see another- and she pockets the
real one.

The Merchant is aghast.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Even I can tell this is from the
Dollar Bin at Target. But all she
needs is a sparkly hint of green in
your peripheral vision until she’s
out the door.

TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHES MEN enter with haste. One begins
SNAPPING PHOTOS while Nicky looks to the other.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Pat- we've got cameras here, here,
here and here.

(to Merchant)
We're going to need the
surveillance drives. Can someone
help him with that?

Addled, the merchant looks to a SALESWOMAN across the store.

MERCHANT
Yes. Anna?

He gestures to her and she escorts Pat into the back. Nicky
keeps up the intensity on the merchant.
NICKY
Now look at me.
(he does)
Do I have your attention?
(he does)

Is this everything she touched? I
need you to be absolutely sure.

He nods compliantly.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Everything?

MERCHANT
Everything.

Nicky places a pile of EMPTY EVIDENCE BAGS on the counter.

NICKY

I need you to place any items she
touched into these bags.

(he complies)
One bag per item. Each bag has a
number and each of those numbers
are on this claim form. Are you
paying attention?

He SLAPS A SET OF FORMS on the counter.

NICKY (CONT'D)

This is your record. Please make
sure the numbers are correct. You
will receive two copies- one yellow-
one blue. The blue copy--

The man is checking the numbers intently.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Are you paying attention?

(nod)
The blue copy is your primary copy.
I suggest you put it somewhere
other than the yellow copy. But
only the blue copy can be used to
reclaim evidence. Are you paying
attention?

MERCHANT
Yes.

NICKY
Are the numbers correct?
MERCHANT
Uh-

NICKY
I thought you were paying
attention.

MERCHANT
They seem fine, um, yes.

He THRUSTS A PEN in the Merchant’s face.

NICKY
Good. I need you to sign here.
Initial here. Here and here.
Initial once more.

He TEARS OFF a blue copy and SLAPS it on the counter.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Do not lose it.

He tears off the yellow copy as Pat re-emerges from the back
with a four hard drives in an evidence bag.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Now my partner is coming back to
take a statement. It might be
helpful if you jot a few things
down while your memory’s still
fresh. Can you do that?

He nods as Nicky gathers up the evidence bags of jewelry.

NICKY (CONT'D)
If you have any questions, this is
my card, okay?

MERCHANT
Okay.

NICKY
We’re gonna get this done as soon
as possible. Promise.
(holds out his hand)
Pen.

MERCHANT
Huh?

NICKY
You stole my pen.
MERCHANT
Oh! Sorry.

The Merchant finds Nicky’s pen in his pocket, hands it back.

NICKY
Thank you.

Nicky heads for the door. The Merchant watches, concerned.

MERCHANT
Blue copy, right?
NICKY
(smiles)
You were paying attention. Very

good.
And with a wide smile, Nicky’s gone.

The Merchant looks to the business card. It’s BLANK. He
turns it over. BLANK.

Confused, he picks up the blue form. What he sees concerns
him: A SMILING CARPET LOGO above a company name- “MISTER
STEAMY CARPET CLEANING.” He looks up.
The store is EMPTY- every DISPLAY CASE has been cleaned out.
Anna emerges from the back, not yet aware...
ANNA

That policeman gave me a blank

card. Isn’t that funny?
And as the Merchant bolts for the door--

SMASH CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: “FOCUS”

EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - DUSK

High above the city in the cool blue gloam of twilight, Nicky
takes in the view from the BALCONY. He seems as distant as
the lights on the horizon, as he nibbles on a small package
of gummy bears.

He CRUMPLES the empty bag and returns to his room.
INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Nicky waits for the elevator. He notices a MOTHER and her
SON approaching from down the hall. He watches them.

DING! The doors open. Nicky enters the elevator, presses the
lobby button. The mother rushes for the elevator.

MOTHER
Coming...

Nicky pays no mind and doesn’t register the woman's
astonished face as the doors SHUT on her just inches away.

MOTHER (0.C.) (CONT'D)
Really?!

No reaction.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Nicky approaches a comely CONCIERGE. He turns on the charm.

NICKY
Hi, how are you tonight?
CONCIERGE
I'm fine, thanks- how can I help
you?
NICKY

Weren’t you working this morning?
You must be exhausted. I hope
they’re paying you enough.

CONCIERGE
Well, no, but thank you for
noticing.

NICKY

I know Elegio is reservation only,
but do they still accept walk-ins
at the bar?

CONCIERGE
Yes, but at eight it may not be
worth your time...

NICKY
That’s why I wanted to talk to you.
(smile)
(MORE )
NICKY (CONT'D)
Could you call them and tell them
Chef Julien Bardolejo of Las Losos
in Barcelona was hoping they’d save
a spot for him at the bar?

CONCIERGE
(smiles knowingly)
I suppose I could give it shot.

NICKY
You have a wonderful night.

He finishes with a wide smile that satisfies her. It quickly
fades as he heads for the door- passing a group of TOURISTS
posing for a photo. One of them EXTENDS A CAMERA to him.

TOURIST
Would you mind...?

He keeps walking, pretending not to hear.

INT. ELEGIO RISTORANTE - BAR - NIGHT

A high end hotel restaurant with a crowded bar- Nicky seated
prominently at the head of it, enjoying a glass of wine as a
WAITER places a PLATE of finely prepared food before him.

NICKY
Gracias, sefor.

He cuts into his food, takes a bite.

ON THE KITCHEN DOOR: A CHEF and SOUS CHEF sneak looks at him,
awaiting a reaction to their food. Nicky reaches for the
SALT. The chef is crushed.

CHEF
Dammit...

The sous chef tries to console him as he skulks off.

BACK ON NICKY: Looking around the bar, taking in the faces of
the strangers. Eventually, at the far end of the bar--

A beautiful young woman (JESS BARRETT) shoos off the advances
of a DRUNKEN STRANGER. We can’t hear, but reading her lips--

JESS
I'm waiting for someone. He'll be
here any minute...
10.

Nicky watches the drunk lean in close to her. She looks
around trying to ignore the clingy suitor, making brief eye
contact with Nicky. She SMIRKS at him as she gently PUSHES
the drunk away with a laugh.
Nicky smiles and returns to his food. He salts it again.
CHEF (0.S.)
(distant, from kitchen)
FUCK!
This amuses Nicky, until-

JESS (0.S.)
Are you a serial killer?

CUT WIDE to reveal JESS is standing next to him.

NICKY
No. Not anymore, at least.

She smiles.

JESS
Can you be my boyfriend for a
minute?

NICKY

Sure. Waiting for someone?

JESS
Not really. No.

NICKY
Join me for dinner?

JESS
Love to.

He turns to the bartender to order when she suddenly grabs
his plate and starts eating.

NICKY
I was going to--
(then)
Never mind.
(to Bartender)
Uno mas por favor.

JESS
This is really good.

NICKY
It is.
11.

JESS
Kinda salty though.
NICKY
Didn’t notice...
JESS
I'm Jess.
NICKY
Nicky.

They share a smile.

INT. ELEGIO RISTORANTE - BAR - LATER

Near closing time. The crowd has thinned. Jess and Nicky are
still at the bar, surrounded by half-empty wine glasses and a
mostly eaten dessert, clearly enjoying themselves.

JESS
What was this one again?

NICKY
Montrachet.

JESS
Montrachet. And this one?

NICKY
Gevrey Chambertin. Same region,
different grape.

JESS
Burgundy.

NICKY
Very good.

JESS
Yaaaaay...

A mini high five as Jess beams. Even to a guarded man like
Nicky, she’s disarming and sexy without trying.

JESS (CONT'D)
So confusing. How’d you learn all
this?

NICKY
Mostly by drinking. The more you
drink the more you learn...
12.

JESS
Well then that makes me the
foremost expert on Jaeger Bombs.

They laugh. The bartender gently places the BILL before
Nicky. The couple mourns it’s arrival.

BARTENDER
For the wine. Food is compliments
of the Chef.

Nicky nods politely and pulls out a huge roll of hundreds.

JESS
Does this mean it’s over? I still
have so much to learn.

NICKY
I’m afraid so.

JESS
Sad. Well thanks for the rescue...

NICKY
No problem, although I think your
nemesis has lost his sting.

He motions across the bar where the drunk guy has nodded off
with his head in his hand.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Can I walk you somewhere?

JESS
(pointing upstairs)
Actually I’m staying here.

NICKY
Oh...

JESS
So, yes.

A look. A beat.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Nicky and Jess kiss passionately as they back up to the bed,
landing on it with her atop him.

After a deep, deep kiss Jess sits up with a smoldering look.
She starts to remove her top when--
13.

SLAM! The door WHIPS OPEN to reveal a HUGE MAN with a GUN.

HUGE MAN
I knew you were here, bitch!

Jess flies off of Nicky who sits up quickly.

JESS
It’s my husband!

NICKY
You're married!?

HUGE MAN
Shut the fuck up!

JESS
Jared wait!

Jared rushes toward Nicky and SLAM! PINS HIM AGAINST THE
HEADBOARD-- holding the gun to his mouth.

JARED
I’m gonna fucking kill you!

JESS
NO Jared! Let him go!

JARED
No fucking way! You’re dead.
(gets in his face)
Give me one fucking reason I
shouldn't do it?!

Nicky, strangely calm, thinks a moment.

NICKY

I'm drawing a blank...
JARED

What?
NICKY

I think you should do it. I mean
let's be honest. You’ve been
aggrieved.

Jared and Jess are stymied.
JESS

Don’t mess around with him Nicky-
he’s done hard time!
14.

NICKY
(to Jared)
And frankly, if you had any idea
what I was planning to do to your
wife before you came in, you’d be
really aggrieved.

JARED
Shut up man!

NICKY
Dirty stuff. Really dirty stuff.
Real Apehouse stuff.

JESS
Wait a second- what kind of stuff
are we talking about?

NICKY
Tommy Lee kind of stuff. You should
definitely shoot.

JARED
Stop fucking around! I’1l do it!

NICKY
You'd be doing me a huge favor.
Seriously- I’ve got a brain tumor
the size of a softball.

Jared is surprised to hear this.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Please...

JARED
(conflicted)
Ah shit! You got cancer?

He backs away as Jess goes is suddenly defeated.

JESS
He’s onto to us. Are you a pro?
JARED
Shit. I told you this wasn’t going
to work.
JESS

Just give us the money.

NICKY
Or what?
15.

JESS
Or he’s gonna shoot you in the
neck.

JARED

I don’t want to shoot a guy with
cancer. Grandma Mikulski had

cancer...
JESS
He doesn’t have cancer you idiot!
(to Nicky)

Just give us the money.

NICKY

You guys really boned this. You’re
supposed to wait until she gets my
pants off so when you come in I
leave them behind when you tell me
to run. Then you got the cash and
I’m never coming back. Second-
whatever you heard- about how it’s
not a felony if there’s no bullets
in the gun? It’s crap. Deadly
weapon, loaded or not.

Jared and Jess completely drop their guard.

JESS
When did you make us?

NICKY
When you lifted the drunk guy’s
wallet.

JESS
What? Bullshit.

Nicky reaches into her jacket on the bed, pulls out a man’s
wallet and tosses it to her.

NICKY
Couldn’t have been more obvious...

She catches it, Nicky heads for the door.

JESS
It was good lift!

NICKY
Sure it was...

Nicky is gone, turns her frustration on Jared.
16.

JESS
Why didn’t you wait!?

JARED
How was I supposed to know when you
had his pants off!?

JESS
How many times did we go over this?
I say, “that’s the biggest one I’ve
ever seen” and then you come
through the door.

JARED
I did hear it! But now I’m thinking
it came from across the hall. What
are the chances!?

JESS
I should have never asked you to do
this!
JARED
Are you mad at me?
JESS
Yeah.
JARED

Can I still be your trainer?
Jess cools slightly.
JESS
(deep exhale)
Yeah...
JARED
Are you still gonna come to my
Zamba class?
JESS
...Yeah.
EXT. NYC STREET - CHELSEA - NIGHT

Nicky makes his way through the chilly night back to his
hotel. He’s seems pretty unfazed by the goings on.

JESS (0.S.)
That was not a shitty lift!

He stops, turns- Jess a few yards behind him and approaching.
17.

NICKY
The drummer from Def Leopard could
take the poke off a drunk. You
think that makes you special?

JESS
No. This does.

She pulls out a DIFFERENT WALLET. Nicky pauses. He pats his
breast pocket, it’s his. He’s impressed.

EXT. THE HIGH LINE - OPEN AIR CAFE - NIGHT

A romantic open air CAFE atop THE HIGH LINE. Nicky and Jess
have coffee at a cozy table. Nicky is mid story.

NICKY

..-my Grandfather used to pay Union
Pacific twenty grand a year to let
him run a game on their trains. Not
to the conductor- the owner
himself. Cash in hand. Never had a
problem, until one day the game got
held up by a team out of Toledo.
But one of the players had a little
derringer- thinks its a good time
to defend himself- whips it out-
misses. Other guys start firing.
Grandpa catches a bullet in the
eye. Shouldn’t have happened.

(then)
Know who knocked over the game?
My dad.

JESS
No. Did he know?

NICKY

Of course. He raised my dad in it
just like my dad raised me in it.
You see an angle- you play it. He
didn’t mean for it to go down that
way- thought he’d impress him later
by splitting up the money with him.
At least that’s what I was raised
to believe.

(then)
He was only eighteen years old...

JESS
Jesus.
18.

NICKY
You do this long enough, you see
everyone as a player or as someone
to be played. It’s no life.

JESS
What’s your thing? Inside? Roper?

NICKY
Everything- been in it so long.
Short grift, Big Store. Work the
whiz all over too. Cannon...

JESS
That’s what I want to do.

NICKY
No you don’t.

JESS
I want to learn it all. I want you
to show me.

NICKY
Look-

JESS
No- I wasn’t born into this like
you. I was a dyslexic foster kid-
no prospects, no future. It’s a
minor miracle I’m not a hooker
right now. I was lucky enough to
have a boyfriend to show me how to
lift and I’ve done okay. I know I
have a lot to learn but its not
like mentors are falling off trees.
You’re my shot.

NICKY
You want advice? Here- Stay off the
grift and stay away from the whiz
mobs. Because once you're in,
you're in. Stick to the pockets,
work alone. Save your money and one
day you get out and start a
business or something. Maybe you
fall in love or just have a life.

JESS
I can pay you. Just teach me.

NICKY
I don’t do that.
19.
A WAITER leans in and places the CHECK between them. Nicky
reaches for it, Jess stops him.

JESS
I got this.

The waiter EXITS, revealing Jess has PULLED THE WALLET FROM
THE WAITER’S POCKET WITH HER OTHER HAND.

JESS (CONT'D)
I’m good. You know I’m good.

She pulls out some cash. Nicky smiles.
NICKY

Not the point. Besides- I’m leaving
town tomorrow.

JESS
Where are you going?

NICKY
Detroit.

JESS

Now you're being a dick. No one
goes to Detroit.

NICKY
None of your business.
JESS
At least teach me something.
NICKY
I gotta go.
JESS

Just one thing? Can you show me

just one thing? Something new I

could use? Anything? Pleeease?
(off Nicky’s look)

I bought you coffee...

Nicky SIGHS.

EXT. HIGH LINE - 23RD STREET LAWN - LATER

Nicky demonstrates for Jess. His COAT hangs on a sign and he
uses his wallet in the front lapel pocket as an example.
20.

NICKY
I’1ll teach you how to do a few
touches but that’s it. I’1l assume
you can flip a leather on it’s
feet, throw it over if you need to-
and pull...

Quickly and smoothly he positions the wallet without moving
the coat and eventually pulls it out. Something to see. He
tosses it in another pocket.

NICKY (CONT'D)

Breast pocket is harder but we know
you've got that down- at least if
the guy’s had 6 MacCallans...

JESS
Ha ha...

NICKY
Sneaky is fine, but you can get
away with much more when you have
their attention.

He turns to her, taking control.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Look him in the eye. Shake his hand
maybe-

He gives her a shake. Once he lets go, he raises his other
hand to show her a PAIR OF GLASSES.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Did you feel that?

JESS
(smirk)
No.

NICKY
How about this?

He holds up her WATCH. She’s shocked.

JESS
You took that right off my wrist!

NICKY
It’s about distraction. It’s about
focus. The brain is slow and it
can’t multitask. You touch him here-
do what you want here-
21.

Nicky holds up a MEMBERSHIP CARD.

NICKY (CONT'D)
You take Zumba?

JESS
That’s not mine.

He continues with incredible agility and speed.

NICKY
Tap him here, take from here. Look
over there, he follows. Take from
here...

He’s showing her things from her pockets without her even
realizing his other hand is pulling out OTHER THINGS. It’s a
slick, flirtatious ballet and she’s in the middle of it.

NICKY (CONT'D)
What’s on your head?

Her GLASSES are now on her head. She smirks. How could she
not feel that?

NICKY (CONT'D)
Are you gonna slap me?

JESS
Why?

NICKY
If you knew where my hand was you'd
want to.

She looks down, but it’s too late- he’s already pulled her
iPhone out of her back pocket.

The show continues, becoming ever more seductive, until she
can’t take it anymore.

JESS
Okay okay okay... I get it.

Nicky takes a moment. He steps in close, stares in her eyes.
He gently raises her hand into frame...

...and PLACES HER OWN RING BACK ON HER FINGER. She’s wetter
than a submarine with screen doors.

NICKY
Now you've got something to
practice...
22.

He walks away, leaving her gobsmacked on the green expanse of
the 23rd Street Lawn.

FADE OUT.

INT. EMPTY BUNGALOW - DAY

Nicky and an older man, HORST, wander through a well worn but
empty house- peeking in room after room in relative silence.

NICKY
Why do I like this place?

HORST

No neighbors for one. Foreclosures
all around it. I tied ‘em all up
with offers just in case somebody
decides to buy a house down here
again.

(Nicky nods)
Follow me.

EXT. BUNGALOW BACKYARD - DAY

PALM TREES and SUN tell us we’re not in New York anymore.
Nicky and Horst emerge from the pastel 1920's bungalow to a
large yard with and empty pool and look at a UTILITY POLE.

HORST
Sub-junction. We can tie in to
multiple lines so we can diffuse
our footprint and keep hopping DNS
addresses. FIOS too...

Nicky nods again.
NICKY

How many bathrooms? Fat Ass Farhad
is flying in so--

HORST

Two and a half. He still got IBS?
NICKY

Yeah.
HORST

He should do a cleanse.

NICKY
He’s a 500 pound Persian, Horst-
he’s not gonna do a cleanse.
(MORE )
23.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Give him the half-bath. I don’t
want to hear it from Manny and Bob.

HORST
We'll be up and running by morning.
Where you been staying? Hyatt

again?

NICKY
I like the brunch. You should come
by.

HORST

No brunch. I’m doing a cleanse.

Nicky tunes him out.

EXT. MIAMI - DUSK

Various shots of Nicky driving Miami causeways and streets.

EXT. DOG TRACK —- HOLLYWOOD FLORIDA - SUNSET

GREYHOUNDS lit by late afternoon sun run the track as the
crowd CHEERS.

IN THE STANDS, Nicky takes in the last race with a beer. The
table before him is littered with CRUMPLED RACE TICKETS. His
somber face denotes concern.

And as the ANNOUNCER calls the end of the race, Nicky
CRUMPLES up yet another ticket and sighs.

INT. MIAMI BEACH HYATT HOTEL —- DAY

A crowded dining area by the pool, populated by FOOTBALL
FANS. Alone at a table, Nicky reads a PAPER and sips COFFEE.

WAITRESS (0.S.)
Will you be ordering from the menu
this morning or using the buffet?

NICKY
(not looking up)
Buffet.

WAITRESS (0.S.)
I think you’1l find the pancakes
are the best in all of Detroit.

He looks up. It’s Jess, proud of herself.
24.
NICKY
Impressive.

JESS
May I?

He nods and she sits.

NICKY

Hyatt rewards card in my wallet?
JESS

Yep.
NICKY

But why Miami?

JESS
It’s Super Bowl week. It’s sucker
central. Even I know that.

They take in the surrounding PATRONS, dressed in football
jerseys and drinking heavily.

JESS (CONT'D)
Mardi Gras for every lifter and
grifter in North America.

NICKY

How many Hyatts did you try?
JESS

All seven... three times each.
NICKY

Sounds boring.
JESS

Not so bad. Gave me time to

practice.
She turns over her purse- 24 WATCHES pour out onto the table.

JESS (CONT'D)

Thanks for showing me that.
(then)

Now I want in.

NICKY
Maybe I’m just here to see the
game.
He smiles.

25.

JESS
Everyone knows who ran the game on
the Union Pacific. You're Nicky
Spurgeon. Your grandfather was The
Limehouse Kid. Your father is Bucky
Spurgeon who’s like the best
insideman that’s ever been. I know
you're doing something big down
here. I just want in.

NICKY
I’m all crewed up.
JESS
Oh come on.
(he shrugs)

Look- Can we skip the part where I
speak with thinly veiled allure?
Where I lead you to believe there’s
gonna be some earth shattering hump
in the works? Please spare me that
because I suck at that kind of
stuff. I just want in.

NICKY

No thinly veiled allure?
JESS

Nope.
NICKY

No baby voice? No lingering eye
contact? No lippy mouthing of your

straw?
JESS
I’m hopeless.
NICKY
A hand grazing my knee?
JESS
Nope.
NICKY

But I love that stuff.

JESS
Sorry.
26.

NICKY
You really should learn. It’s a
useful tool, professionally.

She purses her lips and cocks her shoulders.
JESS
(baby voice)
Well maybe you can teach me... in
your room...

She sips from Nicky’s orange juice straw. He is appalled.

NICKY
Oh my God... that’s terrible.

JESS
I know! See?

NICKY
We should go.

Nicky gets up. Jess is excited.

JESS
Am I in?

NICKY
We should go.

She follows him, beaming.
CUT TO:

MONTAGE - SUPER BOWL WEEK IN MIAMI

INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a bar packed with fans of the opposing
teams as they drink and revel.

NICKY (V.O.)
Every minute there’s something
going on down here. Every bar,
restaurant, hotel, wherever...

SHOT CONTINUES as a BEARDED MAN bumps into a FAN, quickly
apologizing. TILT DOWN as HE TAKES THE FAN’S WALLET.

NICKY (V.O.)
Guys working alone, working in
teams. Not just cash either.
Identity theft is a big thing too.
27.

ON THE WALLET as the thief PULLS OUT a CREDIT CARD and HANDS
IT ANOTHER THIEF who SWIPES it on a HANDHELD CARD READER.

NICKY (V.O.)
You can skim the data off a credit
card in about a second...

The credit card is returned to the wallet, passed off again
and within seconds-- the WALLET IS BACK IN THE FAN’S BACK
POCKET and he is none the wiser.

NICKY (V.O.)
.--and by the time the mark gets
wise, he’s back in Youngstown
arguing with his wife over the card
statement.

SHOT CONTINUES to REVEAL NICKY AND JESS at the bar-
surrounded by a GANG of ROWDY GUYS. Nicky is mid-bet with a
one of them, a BALD GUY.

Nicky refers to two SHOT GLASSES before him. ONE filled to
the brim with BOURBON, the other with WATER.

NICKY
I’1l make the bourbon and the water
switch glasses without pouring them
into anything, including my mouth-

BALD GUY
No way. But hell- Fifty bucks? Why
the fuck not?

The other men start waving money around, wanting a piece of
the action. Jess COLLECTS it as:

Nicky grabs a COASTER, PUTS IT ON THE WATER FILLED SHOT GLASS-
turns it UPSIDE DOWN and puts it ON THE BOURBON GLASS.

He PULLS THE COASTER OUT SLIGHTLY to open up a little space
between the glasses and they all watch as PHYSICS TAKES OVER:

THE HEAVIER WATER FLOWS DOWN INTO THE BOURBON GLASS AND THE
LIGHTER BOURBON FLOATS UP INTO THE WATER GLASS. The men
explode in delighted disbelief.

ROWDY GUYS
OOOH! No way! Awesome! Etc...

NICKY
(checks his watch)
It’s been fun guys...

Smiling Nicky GRABS THE MONEY and they EXIT.
28.

EXT. LUXURY HOTEL - NIGHT
MONTAGE CONTINUES as Jess and Nicky emerge from a cab.

NICKY
There’s a flight landing every two
minutes at Miami International.
Average of 200 passengers per
flight. Whoevers not here for the
game is here for the party- every
one of them looking to drink big,
bet big, cheat on their spouse--
and it all costs money...

And as they enter the--

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

A busy lobby. PEOPLE mill about, OTHERS are lined up at the
registration desk with their luggage.

NICKY
(checking his watch)
There’s boost teams at all the
major hotels. They hit quick and
get out before anyone knows what
happened...

Nicky suddenly stops short and YELLS at Jess.

NICKY (CONT'D)
IF YOU THINK I’M GONNA LET YOUR
MOTHER TALK TO ME THAT WAY YOU'RE
FUCKING CRAZY!

THE ENTIRE LOBBY TURNS. Jess stands there perplexed and ready
to hit him. But as Nicky keeps YELLING--

QUICK CUTS all around the LOBBY as THIEVES DISGUISED AS
TOURISTS take advantage of the situation with amazing speed:

BY A GIFT SHOP: A passing thief SWAPS OUT a GUCCI SHOPPING
BAG at the feet of a rich woman, stealing hers.

ON THE REGISTRATION LINE: A “GUEST” places a FALSE BOTTOM
SUITCASE over someone else’s SMALLER SUITCASE and calmly
walks away with it inside.

All around, SWAPS AND LIFTS play out within seconds to other
unsuspecting people.

BACK TO NICKY and JESS. Nicky is suddenly contrite:
29.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Sorry sweetie, me and my temper...

He hugs her. She’s mystified.

JESS
What the hell was that?

NICKY
Don’t worry about it.

They resume their walk across the lobby.

JESS
Did I miss something...?

INT. HOTEL SUITE - EARLIER THAT DAY

CONTINUE MONTAGE as a group of HUSTLERS and CARD SHARPS hang
out in a room. It’s a cheater’s gymnasium-- some practice
double deals, others shuffle cards with staggering dexterity.

NICKY (V.O.)
There’s card games everywhere and
they let anyone with enough cash
in. Chances are at least one of
those guys you don’t know is a
mechanic who can work a deck like
Jascha Heifetz doing Tedesco...

A CARD MECHANIC shaves down the side of a card deck with
sandpaper. A HUSTLER passes out STACKS OF CASH to the others.

NICKY (V.O.)
Guys will shave down the entire
deck except for the aces so they
can feel them when they shuffle and
pull them out when they need them.

ANOTHER CARD SHARP puts in a CONTACT LENS.
NICKY (V.O.)
Some guys use marked cards you can
only see with polarized contacts
and glasses...
CUT TO:
CARD SHARP POV:

A PLAYER across from him holds a FIVE CARD HAND. The value of
his cards are CLEARLY MARKED IN RED on the backs.
30.

PLAYER
Trips...

CUT TO REVEAL WE’RE AT-—

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

A HIGH STAKES GAME at a raucous high end party in a
penthouse. A huge pile of chips and cash is in play.

The Card Sharp is opposite the PLAYER, shaking his head in
disbelief as he lays down FOUR OF A KIND.

POKER PLAYERS
Whoa! Shit! Etc...

CARD SHARP
I swear, I’ve never had a four of a
kind before!

The Player as well as TOBEY MAGUIRE and LEBRON JAMES suffer a
huge loss as the “surprised” Card Sharp rakes in the chips.

MONTAGE CONTINUES as CAMERA DRIFTS from the table to REVEAL
that Nicky and Jess are watching nearby.

NICKY
Come with me...

CAMERA CONTINUES past them, THROUGH THE WALL to reveal--

INT. HOTEL SUITE / HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

A MARK and BUXOM WOMAN are about to fornicate when- SLAM!
The door to the room is kicked open by a BIG BRUISER.

BUXOM WOMAN
It’s my husband!

As they scramble--

BRUISER
I’m gonna kill you!

MARK
(to woman)
Give me my pants!

BUXOM WOMAN
No! Just run!
31.

CAMERA FOLLOWS the pants-less mark as he dodges the Bruiser
and runs out the door and into the HALL-- PASSING JESS AND
NICKY from the opposite direction. Nicky looks to Jess--
clearly inferring that that is how it’s done.

NICKY
Married guys are the best- who are
they gonna tell?
A second woman SCREAMS from ANOTHER ROOM.

WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
That’s my husband!

ANOTHER PANTSLESS MARK bursts out of a different room,
running for the elevator as Jess and Nicky round the corner.

END MONTAGE as we CUT TO--

INT. NICKY’S CAR - NIGHT

CLOSE ON NICKY, driving. CLOSE ON JESS next to him. Looking
uneasy, she shoots an occasional GLANCE over her shoulder.

CUT WIDE to reveal FAT ASS FARHAD, the 500 pound Persian who
is filling up the back seat and scowling at Jess.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Who's she?

NICKY
That’s Jess, Farhad. She’s our
intern.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Oh...

A long silence, then--

FAT ASS FARHAD (CONT'D)
You hittin’ that?

JESS
(furls her brow)
I’m right here.

NICKY
No.

FAT ASS FARHAD
She's feisty.
Beat.

32.

NICKY
Yeah...

FAT ASS FARHAD
You should hit that.

JESS
Hello? I’m still right here.

FAT ASS FARHAD
(pointing ahead)
Next block. Take a left.

NICKY
Okay.

FAT ASS FARHAD
I'd totally hit that.

JESS
Is this a hazing thing? Like making
a frat boy blow a goat?
(then)
Now that I say that I guess I
shouldn't complain...

FAT ASS FARHAD
She talks a lot...

EXT. BANK - NIGHT

A BUSINESSMAN gets cash from an ATM machine and exits. A
moment later, FARHAD ENTERS FRAME.

He quickly REMOVES THE PLASTIC FACE OF THE MACHINE, revealing
that it is an exact replica of the machine face beneath it.

Nicky and Jess watch as he walks back to the car with it.

NICKY
A skimmer swipes the card and
records the keystrokes so you can
get the PIN too.

JESS
Wow. He made that?

NICKY
Few years back he replaced the
credit card terminals at 78
Starbucks in the Southwest.
(MORE )
33.

NICKY (CONT'D)

(then)
Took down a quarter million before
they caught on.

JESS
What’s a guy like that do with that
kind of money?

NICKY
Bought his mom a house, got the Lap
Band...

INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Nicky, Jess and Farhad (holding the ATM facade) enter the
bungalow. There’s STOLEN MERCHANDISE everywhere as well as a
group of GRIFTERS working a small BANK OF PHONES.

NICKY
We’re about 30 strong- everyone
makes a percentage. We cover bribes
and the fall money for anybody who
gets pinched, knock wood-

KNOCK KNOCK. Everyone else knocks wood along with Nicky.

NICKY (CONT'D)
We sell the ATM data to a guy in
Singapore and the shopaholics over
there...

(referring to phone bank)
..-buy merchandise we overnight to
ourselves and resell on the gray
market. Yesterday we bought 200
Canon Sure Shots...

They pass FAMILIAR FACES from the hotel lobby UNPACKING
stolen Louis Vuitton SUITCASES, finding JEWELRY, CASH,
PASSPORTS, etc...

JESS
Oh my god...

Jess picks up a beautiful DECO STYLE GARNET NECKLACE.
JESS (CONT'D)
This is so incredible. You think I
could--

Nicky grabs it from her.
34.

NICKY

Nope. We sell everything. Take no

chances.

She takes it back.

JESS

It could be an advance. Please...
NICKY

Advance? Don’t get ahead of

yourself.
He takes it from her again.

JESS
What about the big con? I thought
you were all big time, what’s the
big con?

NICKY
We’ll get to that.

They enter a nearby ROOM. CASH riffles through a counter next
to JENNY (55) who bundles stacks of bills and puts them in a
SAFE.

JESS
Whoa...

NICKY
Jenny- front me five K. I got bit
at the track.
Jenny has a MOMENT OF PAUSE, then tosses him a banded stack.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Have you seen Horst?

JENNY
Smoking.

Nicky nods, turns to Jess.
NICKY
I gotta take care of something. Be
right back.

She nods and watches as he goes outside, joining Horst on the
back porch.

She turns back toward the living room. Farhad motions for
her to join him. She reluctantly approaches.
35.

INT. BUNGALOW - LATER THAT NIGHT

A few of THE CREW stack MERCHANDISE AND MILL ABOUT. Jess and
Farhad sit at his computer, looking at something.

JESS
Awww- who’s that?

FAT ASS FARHAD
That's my little girl Mina.

JESS
Cute.

FAT ASS FARHAD
(click)
My son, Dani.

JESS
Sweet.

FAT ASS FARHAD
(click)
That's my wife Lida.

JESS
Pretty.

FAT ASS FARHAD
(click)
That’s my dick.

JESS
(ignoring)
Uh huh...

FAT ASS FARHAD
Sorry about that.
(click)
That’s my dog...

JESS
Awwww.

They click through a few more. Then-

JESS (CONT'D)
So you’ve known Nicky a long time?

FAT ASS FARHAD
Yeah. Ten years or so...

JESS
Are you friends?
36.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Yeah I guess I’m about the closest
thing he got to a friend.

JESS
How long have you known him?

FAT ASS FARHAD
Uh- ten years? Why?

JESS
Just wondering.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Okay you got me-- we’re sleeping
together okay? Like the Ancient
Greeks. It’s so beautiful.

Jess laughs.

FAT ASS FARHAD (CONT'D)
Actually, I don’t know. I like the
guy. I do. Trust him. But people
just aren’t his bag.

JESS
I guess you can’t blame him. I mean
he told me about that thing with
his dad and his grandfather. Crazy.

Farhad is surprised to hear this. A moment, then-

FAT ASS FARHAD
He told you that?
(then)
I mean- I’ve heard that story, but-
never from him.

HORST (0.S.)
Jess?

Horst is at the threshold.

HORST (CONT'D)
Are you Jess?

JESS
Yes. Hi.

HORST
Horst. Nice to meet you. Nicky says
you're quite a gifted wire.
37.

JESS
Never said that to me, but I’11
take the compliment.

HORST
He’d like to see you.

EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Jess comes out to the dim porch to find Nicky sitting on some
old patio furniture watching a HORSE RACE on a small TV.

JESS
Who you rooting for?

NICKY
The wrong horse.

He gets up.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Horst runs the whiz. He’s the
cannon and the steer. He’s also
your boss if you still want in.

JESS
Really!? Yes! Yes! Thank you!

She bounces and gives him an impulsive hug.

NICKY
Don’t thank me. You’ve got a busy
week coming.

He reaches into an envelope, hands her a CREDIT CARD.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Here’s a clean card. Jenny will
make you a Florida ID.

JESS
(regards card)
Ooh, Platinum. You know a good
hotel? I don’t know Miami really.

NICKY
I already got you a place.

She's pleasantly surprised.

JESS
Really? Is it nice?
38.
NICKY
Not bad. I think you’1l like it.

JESS
Thanks. How do I get there?

NICKY
Need a car?

JESS
I don’t really drive. New Yorker...

NICKY
Oh... Need a ride?

JESS
Really? Sure...

A moment as both of them think about this. A long beat.
JESS (CONT'D)
(a little nervous)
I mean... If that’s okay with
you...

He looks at her, thinks.

INT. SETAI HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

A ridiculously lush suite. Jess in the powder room in a
lightweight robe, looking in the mirror, primping.

As we watch Jess, we HEAR THE CONVERSATION from the PREVIOUS
SCENE CONTINUE:

NICKY (0.C.)
I'm fine with it. Are you?

She exits the powder room, relishing the luxury of her well
appointed suite as she approaches the BEDROOM SUITE...

JESS (0.C.)
You seem like a pretty good driver.
I’1ll take a chance.

NICKY (0.C.)
You can count on me.

She slowly pushes through the bedroom door--

JESS (0.C.)
Can I?
39.
NICKY (0.C.)
Most would say no.

JESS (0.C.)
I don’t know. You seem trustworthy.

NICKY (0.C.)
That would be your first mistake.

JESS (0.C.)
(laughs)

The bedroom is empty. Nicky is not in the room with her.

BACK TO:

EXT. BUNGALOW BACKYARD - EARLIER THAT NIGHT

Romantic tension is palpable as they look at one another.
Nicky seems to second guess his impulses for a moment. She
picks up on it and lets him off easy.

JESS
Maybe I’1l just take a cab.

Nicky gives a gentle nod. She walks away.

EXT. SETAI HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jess stands out on the BALCONY-- taking in the skyline of
Miami much the way Nicky did in New York.

Finally, a hard earned break.

FADE OUT.

INT. MALL - DAY
OPEN ON 6 inch stiletto heels, shakily walking.

REVEAL JESS- dressed provocatively, squeezed into a tight
dress, her bustline boosted by cutlets.

JESS
Why do I have to do this Horst? I’m
gonna sprain an ankle or I’m gonna
sprain a boob- I’m not sure which.

CUT WIDER to reveal Jess, Horst, the Bearded Thief from the
bar (GARETH) as they walk through a crowded mall.
40.

HORST
Any man pickpocket would kill to
have your figure. No one looks at
your hands when you’ve got that
working for you.

JESS
I can’t breathe.
(adjusting cutlets)
It’s like being felt up by The
Incredible Hulk.

HORST

First things first. We stick to
rich folks. And no one with a cane
or a wheelchair- it’s bad luck.

(then)
Gareth is the stall. All eyes on me
until I make the mark. Once I fan
him- I’1l tug my lapel. Two fingers
means the it’s a prat poke, three
fingers means the leather is an
insider. If it’s a cordeen or an
ox tongue I scratch my nose--
unless I use my thumb which means
I’m actually scrathing my nose.
Anything in the left tail or right
tail I’1l cock my head but nowadays
kiester kicks are 95 percent of it
so just do the touch and I ding the
poke in the nearest mailbox, okay?

JESS
(out of her depth)
Oh my God- what did you just say?
HORST
(sigh)
Okay, plan B--
INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
MUSIC as Nicky pulls into a parking garage, eventually
snagging a spot on Tangerine level.

INT. MALL — DAY

MUSIC CONTINUES as Nicky walks through the mall along the
UPPER LEVEL SHOPS.

He comes to a RAILING, looking down to the LEVEL BELOW.
41.

Nicky sees Jess admiring a dress in a shop window.

Nearby, Horst is eyeing the crowd while perusing his
cellphone. He SNAPS a photo.

ON JESS-- she receives a TEXTED PHOTO OF A RICH WOMAN ON HER
PHONE. She spots the woman in the oncoming crowd. And as the
RICH WOMAN passes behind her, Jess FOLLOWS.

Nicky watches with great interest, starts WALKING, keeping
pace with the action below.

NICKY POV: Jess GAINS on the woman, drawing closer until--

Gareth ‘accidentally’ BUMPS THE WOMAN’S LEFT SHOULDER as he
passes from the other direction. At the same time--

-- JESS PASSES HER ON THE RIGHT, effortlessly DIPS HER HAND
INTO THE WOMAN’S PRADA BAG and pulls out a leather WALLET.

It’s over before the woman even turns to apologize to Gareth.

Nicky is intrigued. She’s a natural. He keeps her in his
sights as she moves. Whatever she’s doing, it’s not over.

NICKY POV: Jess “bumps into” a group of young men, suddenly
taking on the body language of an apologetic, klutzy girl.

Nicky watches as she uses this as a chance to FAN THE MEN’S
CLOTHING as they try to put the ‘klutzy’ Jess at ease.

They look to be GIVING HER DIRECTIONS, unaware as Jess DIPS
into one pocket, then ANOTHER.

ON NICKY: Smirking as she shakes a guy’s hand and TAKES HIS
WATCH like Nicky showed her. She’s graceful and deft.

Nicky tries to keep her in his view as she moves on and
passes Horst. Imperceptibly, she DUMPS THE GOODS WITH HIM AND
KEEPS GOING.

This ballet continues, as does Nicky’s fascination with her.
She's making it look easy but it’s anything but that. He’s
never seen anything like her before... he’s enamoured.

Maybe more.

CUT TO:

INT. BUNGALOW BACKYARD - DAYS LATER - NIGHT

POP! Champagne corks fly as the team celebrates.
42.

Horst, Farhad, Jess are amidst the crowd of crooks, helping
Nicky pour out champagne from a few magnum bottles.

NICKY
A record setting week, everybody.
As of three this morning- One
point two million.

Cheers from the crowd.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Don’t forget to take your personal
belongings tonight- because by the
time the big game is over this
place will be bleached down and
repainted and everything not bolted

down is going in the incinerator.

(then)
Horst has your travel money.

Once

you're home, I’1l wire you all your

cut. Congratulations!

More cheers as they clink plastic glasses--

Farhad takes a swig and raises his glass

FAT ASS FARHAD

once again to Jess.

To the Rookie of the Year. Sorry if

I was a dick...

JESS

Wouldn't have it any other way

Farhad... you make me smile.

FAT ASS FARHAD

You're a cool chick Jess. I dig

your shit.

JESS
Thank you.

They clink glasses.

LATER THAT NIGHT, Jess mills through the
pleasantries with her new acquaintances.

She spots Nicky at the edge of the yard,
She heads over.

CUT TO:

party, exchanges

talking with Horst.

CUT TO:

ACROSS THE YARD, Horst hands Nicky a BLACK DUFFLE BAG.
43.

NICKY
That all of it? One point two?

HORST
(concerned)
Yeah. No ponies or dogs right?

NICKY
How long have you known me?
HORST
That’s my point. See you when I see

you.

They exchange smiles. Horst EXITS, revealing a nearby Jess
who overheard everything.

Nicky is pleased to see her.

NICKY
There she is- I wanted to ask you
something...

JESS
Yeah me too. No big cons? I
thought you were all big time.

NICKY
No big cons. It’s a volume
business. Not sexy, I know- but
it’s profitable, it’s safe and it
works. Hell, we may even offer
health care next year.

JESS
Kind of a gyp.

Nicky smiles at her forwardness.

NICKY
Maybe on the next one, George Raft.
But I just made you fifty K-
where’s the gratitude?

JESS
I’m an ingrate, I admit it. But I’m
ambitious - most people find it
charming.

NICKY
Very charming. But if I could steer
the conversation back to my opening
line. You feel like going to the
game tomorrow?
44,

JESS
Super Bowl? Really? Like, just us?

Nicky offers an affirmative shrug.

JESS (CONT'D)
Yeah. That’d be great.

NICKY
Good. Meet you there.

JESS
(sincere)
But, um, seriously- I want to thank
you for bringing me in on this.
Thanks for trusting me.

She extends her hand. He shakes.

NICKY
No offense, but I never trusted
you.

JESS

None taken. I assume you feel that
way about everybody.

NICKY
I had a dog once, but yeah.

JESS
Poor wounded bird lining his nest
with hundred dollar bills...

NICKY
It’s a sob story, I admit it. I
feel sorry for myself.

JESS
Genius must be such a burden.

NICKY
Crushing.

Jess smiles. Nicky too. A long pause. A kiss moment? Again
Nicky squelches it coolly.

JESS
So, I’ll see you tomorrow.

She walks off, Nicky reaches into his breast pocket.
45.

NICKY
Wait- I forgot to give you your
ticket...

JESS

No you didn’t.
She waves a SUPER BOWL TICKET over her shoulder as she exits
and he puts two and two together. He smirks, loving it,
dwelling on her exit.

PRELAP MUSIC as we CUT TO--

INT. SUN LIFE STADIUM - VARIOUS - DAY
SUPER BOWL. The air is electric, fans pour into the stadium.

At the turnstiles, Jess shows her ticket as she comes
through. A TICKET TAKER points her toward her destination.

CUT TO:

Jess rises to the top of an ESCALATOR- checking her ticket
and looking for a sign to guide her.

CUT TO:
ON AN UPPER LEVEL, a confused Jess approaches an USHER. He
leads her to a set of FROSTED GLASS DOORS which SLIDE OPEN.
INT. STADIUM HALLWAY - DAY

The din of the crowd is muffled within the enclosed hallway.
Eventually her ticket leads her to a door marked “SKY BOX 18”

She checks her ticket to be sure, then OPENS THE DOOR to find-

INT. SKYBOX 18 - CONTINUOUS

The ROAR of the crowd fills her ears as she enters a LUXURY
BOX overlooking the game.

The crowd is almost exclusively ULTRA RICH CHINESE MEN AND
WOMEN, enjoying the buffet, the bar, and the company of a few
SUPERMODELS and CELEBRITIES.

Jess wanders in, convinced she’s in the wrong place until--
Nicky waves from the BALCONY, motions for her to come over.
46.

INT. SKYBOX 18 - LATER

The game is in full swing as Nicky and Jess enjoy themselves
and watch from their prime seats on the balcony.

JESS
How’d you get these tickets?

He points out seven foot six YAO MING inside the suite. They
share a wave.

NICKY
Yao Ming’s a friend.

Jess and Nicky turn their attention back to the field.

JESS
Is this a bad time to mention I
don’t really like football? I mean
it just seems like a lot of
standing around all the time...

NICKY
Lots of standing, with brief
moments of head trauma.

An awkward beat, he looks to the crowd.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Well, if you don’t like football we
can still make it fun...

(sees something)
Okay, look-

He points to the STANDS BELOW where a VENDOR is preparing to
toss a HOT DOG to a FAN eight seats down the row.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Dollar says that guy misses the
catch.

JESS
(smiling, game )
Let’s make it a sawbuck.

NICKY
Done.

THEIR POV: The Vendor THROWS. The fan MISSES the hot dog.

JESS
AH!! How’d you know?
47.

NICKY
That guy can’t throw.

A ROAR as the crowd starts to DO THE WAVE on the other side
of the stadium.

JESS
(searching the crowd)
Okay- there- shirtless guy with
the body paint. Sawbuck says he’s
too drunk to get up for the wave.

NICKY
You sure? His team is on a drive.

JESS
You in or out?

NICKY
In.

The WAVE COMES AROUND- the man does not get up.

JESS
Yessss!! I know my drunks.

NICKY
Nice.

They're having fun. Nicky spots another opportunity.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Okay- there- the mamacita in the
short shorts...

In the stands below, a shapely CUBANA is making her way from
her seat down the row TOWARD THE AISLE.

NICKY (CONT'D)

How many guys will check her out on
the way up the aisle? Closest
without going over wins.

JESS
End seats only? At least ten.

NICKY
There’s a play on. I say three.

VOICE (0.S.)
Six.

They turn to see a CHINESE INDUSTRIALIST sitting nearby.
48.

INDUSTRIALIST

Can I get in on this?
JESS

Sure. Ten bucks- Mister...?
INDUSTRIALIST

Liyuan. I say six guys look. Sure

thing.

They nod in agreement and turn their attention to the
Mamacita as she steps onto the aisle. The FIRST GUY she
passes checks out her shorts.

JESS (0.S.)
That’s one.

THEIR POV: A SECOND GUY looks. Then a THIRD. Then a FOURTH.

NICKY
Damn...

A FIFTH, A SIXTH. She climbs to the last step, exiting-

LIYUAN
It’s six!

But at the last second a SEVENTH MAN turns and rubbernecks.

JESS
SEVEN! Yes!
(to Liyuan)
You’re over! Whooo! I know my
letches too!! Money money money!

She holds out her hand and Mr. Liyuan pays with a smile.

LIYUAN
(playful)
I want justice! I want my money
back! Make another bet.

NICKY / JESS
Sure... okay...

LIYUAN
Which team draws the next foul?

NICKY
Offense.

JESS
Uh- I don’t know football... you
boys play.
49.

LIYUAN
(to Nicky)
Okay, defense. A thousand dollars?
A moment. Unexpected, but Nicky is game.

NICKY
Good.

CUT TO:

ON THE FIELD: The play begins. In moments WHISTLES are blown,
a YELLOW FLAG FLIES.

The LEAD OFFICIAL announces the penalty.
LEAD OFFICIAL
Holding! Number 25. Offense. Five
yards, second down!

Liyuan loses, but takes it in stride. Jess is excited.

JESS
Whoa!

NICKY
Wooo!

Liyuan peels off 2000 DOLLARS from a big roll.
LIYUAN
No way that was a hold. Double or
nothing they make the first down.

Nicky thinks a beat. He seems to be fighting an urge. He
stretches his neck, then...

NICKY
Okay...
ON THE FIELD- The SNAP... the THROW... the CATCH... the
TACKLE... FIRST DOWN!

ON LIYUAN, cringing with another loss. Nicky reaches for the
cash. lLiyuan STOPS HIM, more MONEY in hand.

LIYUAN
Five thousand. Do they pass or run?

Jess tries to make eye contact with Nicky but in the grips of
his affliction he ignores her.

NICKY
Call it.
50.

LIYUAN
They run.

ON THE FIELD: The SNAP, the BLITZ, the QB cocks his arm back-

JESS
(hopeful)
Oh!

BACK ON THE QB: He sees an alley and RUNS. Liyuan WINS.

LIYUAN
Yeah!!!

Nicky smiles, beaten.

JESS
Ouch...

NICKY
Okay, I’ve learned my lesson.
(to waitress)
Can I get a beer?

Liyuan is charged up.

LIYUAN
I give you double or nothing. Your
bet.

Nicky takes a deep breath, thinking. As he exhales...

NICKY
Nah...

LIYUAN
Easy bet, easy bet. They make this
kick, you win. Good odds right?
They always make the kick. You
can’t lose.

Nicky considers it. Jess grows uncomfortable.

LIYUAN (CONT'D)
C’mon- I like to play. I like you.

NICKY
Fine. So what’s that?

LIYUAN
Ten thousand.

Nicky heaves a breath.
51.
LIYUAN (CONT'D)
Too much?

NICKY
I got it. You?

LIYUAN
I always play big.

He points to his BODYGUARD who holds a BRIEFCASE.

NICKY
Ten thousand they make it.
CUT TO:
ON THE FIELD: The SNAP, the KICK... DEFLECTED!
BACK TO:

JESS CRINGES at Nicky’s loss. Liyuan GROANS in faux sympathy.

LIYUAN
Oh no... sorry... I’m a lucky guy.

Nicky looks a little shaken. Jess is concerned.

JESS
Maybe we should g-

NICKY
(interrupting)
Fifty thousand.

Heads turn. Nicky has fire in his eyes.
NICKY (CONT'D)

Fifty thousand they down the punt.
No return.

LIYUAN
Ahhh. Now you make things
interesting.

(then)
Okay.

ON THE FIELD-- The PUNT flies down the field...
ON NICKY, JESS and LIYUAN-- Nerves fraying.

ON THE BALL as it descends into the arms of a RECEIVER and...
HE RUNS.
52.

ON NICKY, deflating, fifty grand lighter. Jess is sick to
her stomach. Liyuan is thrilled.

And before Jess can console Nicky--

NICKY
(defiant)
A hundred thousand!

JESS
Whoa!

LIYUAN
Hundred thousand? You don’t have a
hundred thousand...

NICKY
Sure I do.

Nicky reaches under his seat, pulls up THE BLACK DUFFLE BAG
HORST GAVE HIM and pulls out TEN BANDED STACKS OF HUNDREDS.

Jess recognizes the bag.

JESS
You can’t do that.
NICKY
It’s fine.
(to Liyuan)

How about you?

Liyuan’s bodyguard pops open the BRIEFCASE next to Liyuan.
It’s full of banded stacks of cash. Nicky nods.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Next pass - incomplete.

LIYUAN
(satisfied)
I say he catches it.

CUT TO:
ON THE FIELD: The SNAP... The BLITZ... The THROW.

...the CATCH. Nicky loses again.

BACK TO:

ON NICKY-- Shaken, absorbing the loss. The room goes eerily
QUIET except for the Rolling Stones’ SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL,
playing on the suite’s sound system.
53.

Liyuan smiles. Nicky might be in shock. Jess grabs him.

JESS
We're going.

She leads him to the door. Nicky looks like he’s
asphyxiating. The walls are closing in on him.

Jess reaches for the handle. And as the door opens, NICKY
TURNS, marches back and--

SPILLS THE WHOLE BAGFUL OF CASH ON A POKER TABLE in the
middle of the suite.

NICKY
All of it.

JESS
Nicky!

Liyuan comes forward. Interested. It’s a lot of cash.
JESS (CONT'D)
(sotto, pissed)
That’s my money too.

Nicky ignores her and grabs a nearby DECK of cards.

NICKY
Million one. High card takes it.

Liyuan is on the spot. He’s uncomfortable for a beat. Then
he blurts out a LAUGH--

LIYUAN
You're crazy! I like it!

He motions to his bodyguard to bring more cash.

NICKY
You first.

Liyuan steps up to the table, takes a breath. He reaches for
the deck, holds his hand on it- WAITING FOR HIS MOMENT. Then--

He CUTS the deck to show THE FIVE OF CLUBS.

The guests voice Liuyan’s disappointment with a COLLECTIVE
‘OOOH...’ Liyuan’s face falls. His first vulnerable moment.

LIYUAN
(in mandarin)
Ah fuck...
54.

Jess GASPS, semi relieved.

NICKY’S TURN. He puts his hand on the deck, staring down
Liyuan with an intense predatory stare.

Nicky smiles. He looks down. He CUTS and turns over...
THE THREE OF HEARTS. Nicky loses.

The world goes swimmy. Nicky’s suddenly a fly in Vaseline.
Jess's knees BUCKLE and she thuds into the sofa behind her.

LARGE CHINESE BODYGUARDS close in around Liyuan and the cash.
A walleyed Nicky watches helplessly until suddenly--

-he snaps out of it and hastily heads for the door, full of
sober self hatred. As he passes Jess-—

NICKY
Let’s go. It’s over.

He doesn’t even wait for her as marches out. She can’t speak.

A bodyguard OPENS THE DOOR wide as Nicky approaches. Then,
as he crosses the threshold--

LIYUAN
Sorry friend- that’s what happens
when you play with the big boys.

Nicky stops short. Things slow way down again. He burns.

JESS
(off Nicky’s expression)
Oh fuck me...
Nicky turns.
NICKY

Give me double or nothing.

LIYUAN
Oh man dude- what are you doing?
Just go home.

NICKY
Double or nothing. I’1l make it
worth your while.

Liyuan is a bit surprised. He thinks about it and--
55.

LIYUAN
No, I don’t think so. You got a
problem my friend.

NICKY
Take those binoculars. I'1l stay
here. Pick any player on or off the
field- any one at all. And I’1l
guess who it is.

Jess is aghast.

LIYUAN
Any player? That’s 60 to one.
NICKY
2 mill- I’m good for it.
LIYUAN
That's fucking crazy.
(bothered)

I don’t like it...

NICKY
Fine. Pick any player on the field.

He points to JESS.

NICKY (CONT'D)
.--and she’1l point him out.

JESS

(agog)
What!? No-

LIYUAN
(wowed)
You're fucking crazy!
(thinks about it, then)
But I can’t turn down free money.

All are abuzz as Liyuan grabs the binoculars and heads for
the balcony.

JESS
What are you doing?! Don’t drag me
into this? Its not enough you lost
everyone’s money. My money?!

Nicky puts a hand on her shoulder.

NICKY
Calm down.
56.
JESS
Get your hands off me! You’re sick!

LIYUAN (0.S.)
She reminds me of my wife...

Nicky tunes her out, turns his attention to Liyuan.
NICKY
It’s a big bet Liuyan. Take your
time.

Liyuan scans the field. He settles on something. A smile.

LIYUAN
Got one. Want me to write it down?
NICKY
I trust you.
(re: Jess)

Now it’s her turn.

JESS
I’m not doing this.
NICKY
Just pick.
JESS
No.
LIYUAN

He’s crazy, I know. But it will be
his fault, not yours.

With a deep breath, she reluctantly agrees. She joins Liyuan
by the balcony and takes the binoculars.

CUT TO:
JESS POV: She pans over the field pausing on various players.
ON JESS, the pressure is killing her.
ON NICKY, calm but concerned.
JESS POV: More scanning of the field, the sidelines...
ON JESS, clueless.

JESS
Uhhhbh...

ON LIYUAN, amused.
57.
JESS (CONT'D)
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Liyuan turns to Nicky.
LIYUAN
I give you a chance to back out
okay? No hard feelings.

Nicky just shakes his head. Tension mounting.

JESS
Oh god... I don’t know...

JESS POV: She pauses on Player #30 on the sidelines, moves
on a few to the right, then back to #30.

ON JESS:

JESS (CONT'D)
Well I guess number... wait--

She sees something, she pans back to the right.
CUT TO:

JESS POV: There, on the sidelines, an INCREDIBLY LARGE
LINEMAN catches her eye. She readjusts her view...

.-.IT’S FAT ASS FARHAD, in uniform number 55, talking to a
COACH on the sidelines.

JESS takes her eyes away from the binoculars, swallowing her
surprise. Nicky sees this from across the room, smiles.

JESS (CONT'D)
Number fifty five.

ON LIYUAN. All eyes are on him. He slowly shakes his head. Is
it a no? Or---

LIYUAN
I don’t believe it...
(blown away)
FUCK! That is unbelievable!!!

GASPS from the guests as they grapple with the upset. Jess
instinctively jumps into character.

JESS
(innocent)
I'm right?! Oh my God! I’m right?!
58.

LIYUAN
(wowed disbelief)
Yes!! You're fucking right!
Fucking shit!! You’re fucking
right!!! Crazy!!!

Nicky starts collecting the cash and the briefcase.

JESS
You’re not mad?

LIYUAN
(crazed delight)
Fuck no! We have to go to Vegas
right now!!! I have a jet!!! That
was incredible!!

Liyuan turns to anyone who will listen as
LIYUAN (CONT'D)
Did you see that!? Did you see what
she did!??
Jess slips over to Nicky as he finishes packing up the money--
LIYUAN (CONT'D)
And you dude! You have big fucking
balls! You are my new fucking hero!

Nicky smiles wide. Then--

NICKY
Double or nothing?

LIYUAN
(crazed delight)
No fucking way!!! Get the fuck out
of my suite!!!

And as they all LAUGH and make their exit--

INT. STADIUM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

ON THE SIDELINES, Farhad is talking to a COACH. We see now IT
IS THE MAN WHO LOST THE POKER HAND IN THE CROOKED HOTEL GAME.

FAT ASS FARHAD
I think I’m good coach. Consider
your debt settled.

Farhad grabs a Gatorade and walks off the field.
59.

EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY

Nicky and Jess walk with hastened pace to a waiting LIMO.

INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Nicky can finally relax as they drive off and Jess can no
longer contain herself.

JESS
I’m going to kill you!!!

NICKY
You did great.

She SWATS him repeatedly and excitedly.

JESS
How did you do that?!!

NICKY
Liyuan is a legendary gambler.
Bets on everything. Anything. Huge
cash bets all the time. Once- the
Bellagio kicked Bill Gates out of
the High Roller Suite because they
heard Liyuan was flying in. He’s
the perfect vic.

JESS
But how did you know who he was
gonna pick!?

NICKY
Because we told him to. We’ve been
telling him all day long...

CUT TO:

INT. FIVE STAR HOTEL CORRIDOR - EARLIER THAT DAY
BEGIN FLASHBACK SEQUENCE of earlier that day--
Liyuan exits his suite with bodyguards, enters the ELEVATOR.

NICKY (V.O.)
From the moment he left his room
this morning we've been priming him-
programming his subconscious. He’s
been seeing the number fifty five
all day long...
60.

IN THE ELEVATOR, an large ADVERTISEMENT for a WINE BAR in the
hotel named “55 Degrees”. Liyuan pays it little mind.

NICKY (V.O.)
On the elevator, in the lobby...

IN THE LOBBY, Liyuan is briefly CUT OFF by a group of FANS
(actually GARETH and some others we recognize from the con-
team). They are all WEARING #55 JERSEYS.

NICKY (V.O.)
...even the stickpin on the
Doorman.

AS HE EXITS, Liyuan is greeted by HORST, dressed as a
DOORMAN. PUSH IN ON HIS LAPEL to see a #55 STICK PIN.

I/E. LIMO AND MIAMI STREETS - DAY
Liyuan rides in a limo, occasionally glancing out the window.

NICKY (V.O.)
.+-Not only that, we loaded his
route from the hotel to the
stadium. He looks out the window,
primers are everywhere.

VARIOUS CUTS- seemingly EVERYDAY EVENTS outside the limo are
given a CLOSER LOOK.

Undercover ACCOMPLICES are everywhere: As PEDESTRIANS in
JERSEYS, as PROTESTERS wearing matching color TEES with 55 on
their SIGNS, BILLBOARDS featuring FARHAD, etc...

NICKY (V.O.)
..-He doesn’t see it, but he does.
Team colors, fifty fives, even
Farhad...

AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT: HONKING gets Liyuan’s attention. He
turns to see FARHAD DRIVING A TAXI- honking and yelling.

NICKY (V.O.)
Suggestions are everywhere- the
number of flowers in a vase, the
tramp stamp on the hooker we sent
to his room last night.

FLASH CUT TO A NAKED WOMAN’S LOWER BACK as Liyuan fucks her
from behind. The number 55 is disguised as a TRIBAL TATTOO.
61.

INT. SKYBOX 18 - EARLIER THAT DAY

An ACCOMPLICE replaces the iPod in the suite’s iPod DOCK and
PRESSES PLAY.

NICKY (V.O.)
It’s also what he hears- from the
words I choose, to the music in his
suite.

FLASHBACK of Nicky challenging Liyuan to the big bet as
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL plays on the iPod DOCK.

NICKY (V.O.)
The Mandarin word for five is
‘woo’. There are 124 woo-woos in

‘Sympathy For the Devil’...

FLASHBACK ON LIYUAN looking through the binoculars, scanning
the field and eventually spotting Farhad.

NICKY (V.O.)
He doesn’t register it, but its all
there. And when he looks through
those binoculars and he spots the
biggest guy on the field he’s ever
seen in his life with the number
fifty five on his Jersey? Some
little voice deep in the back of
his head says, “That’s it”. He
thinks it’s intuition and picks.

A sly smile on Liyuan’s face. Then, as we've already seen--

LIYUAN
I got one. Want me to write it
down?

NICKY
I trust you.
(re: Jess)
Now it’s her turn.

JESS
I’m not doing this!

And as the scene plays on-

NICKY (V.O.)
And you being in the dark and
flopping around like a trout ina
creel made it even more believable.
62.

INT. LIMO - DAY
BACK IN THE PRESENT, Jess’ excitement is unabated.
JESS
(delighted)
You are such an asshole!!

He laughs as she continues to swat at him.

JESS (CONT'D)
There’s no way that can really

work!
NICKY
Quick- what continent is Kenya on?
JESS
Africa.
NICKY
What are the colors of a chess
board?
JESS
Black and white?
NICKY
Name an animal.
JESS NICKY
Zebra. Zebra.

Jess is amazed.

NICKY (CONT'D)
85 percent of the time people say
zebra. The human brain. Hackable.

JESS
So you had an 85 percent chance?

NICKY
Farhad had it at about 59%. Better
odds than Vegas.

JESS
What if he picked wrong?

NICKY
Just double down again until it
happens. It’s probabilistic.
63.

JESS
Well you're still an asshole.
NICKY
You wanted to learn- welcome to the

grift.

She swats him again. He fights back a little as things become
more playful.

He gets a hold of her arms, neutralizing her attack until--
She darts forward, KISSING HIM HARD. He quickly reciprocates.
It’s a long kiss, but they break for air eventually- staring
at one another for an extended beat-- heaving breaths, eyes

speaking unheard doubts and desires. Then--

They resume- passionately and intensely. The chemistry is
undeniable, it’s real. It’s intimate. It’s building.

They manage the occasional comment between kisses.

NICKY (CONT'D)
I’ve wanted this a long time.

JESS
What the hell were you waiting for?

They’re consumed by one another instantly. Hands greedily
fumbling with clothing.

He reaches sensually into her hair and pulls her away from
him for a brief moment- admiring her.

NICKY
Didn't know if I could trust you...

He leans in, she holds him back for a beat.

JESS
And now...?

It burns in his eyes. He pulls her into a passionate kiss.

INT. SETAI HOTEL - JESS’ SUITE - NIGHT

Their two bodies lie still, facing one another, intertwined
in the sheets of Jess’ suite.

We move in slowly, closing in on Jess’ sleeping face.

CAMERA ARCS AROUND to reveal Nicky, awake and gazing at her.
64.
Jess stirs. Her sleepy eyes opening for a moment to find him
there. A small smile, then-

JESS
Go to sleep...

She reaches to pull him closer--

NICKY
You go to sleep...

She gives him a little kiss. She sleepily prods him--

JESS
Such a jerk... made me look like an
idiot...
NICKY
Next time you’1ll be in on it.
JESS
Promise?
NICKY
Promise.
JESS

Next time, you’re the idiot...
She smiles. He gives her a kiss and she drifts back to sleep.

Nicky reflects pleasantly. But soon his expression changes.
There’s concern. Conflict.

FADE OUT.

INT. SETAI HOTEL - JESS’ SUITE - MORNING

OPEN WIDE as sunlight floods the room, eventually REVEALING
Jess in the bed, alone.

She wakes, notices immediately he’s gone.

Rising slightly, she looks around with concern, but the
SOUNDS of milling about in the adjoining room of her suite
soothe her concerns.

She slips into a robe and heads for the door.

CUT TO:

Jess shuffles into the living room with a smile to find a
HOUSEKEEPER, not Nicky. Both are surprised.
65.
JESS
Oh...

Jess turns back as the Housekeeper apologizes in SPANISH, re-
entering her bedroom to find--

A FEW STACKS OF CASH on the dresser. Her cut.
A note. “Goodbye”
Pain wells in her eyes.

CUT TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK
“THREE YEARS LATER”

The searing WHINE of a 19000 RPM ENGINE and the gut pounding
RUMBLE of exhaust builds on the soundtrack until--

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. AUTODROMO BUENOS AIRES - DAY

A FORMULA ONE CAR screams around the track on a test run at
the famous racing complex.

It zooms past the near empty stands, where a daytime COCKTAIL
PARTY is in progress. A few of the fabulous crowd take notice
and CHEER, perched over the railing.

BACK ON THE CAR, circling the track, passing--

IN THE PIT other cars IDLE or are in various states of
maintenance. Members of RACING TEAM GARRIGA diligently work
their various jobs as their driver gets a feel for the track.

IN THE STANDS sits Spanish team owner RAFAEL LAMARCA GARCES
GARRIGA-- 40, wildly wealthy and even more powerful. It oozes
out of every pore.

He sits alone, sipping on an espresso and surveying his team
from on high.

GARRIGA POV: Through the bustle trackside we find NICKY
talking to a rather severe and ominous 60 year old WELSHMAN--
Garriga’s head of security, WILLIAM OWENS.

They huddle around a bank of monitoring equipment and Nicky
points out the readings on several LCD screens.
66.

Owens offers no emotion as he listens. Eventually, he steps
away-- headed for the stands.

Garriga takes another sip of his espresso, never taking his
eyes off the track until--

GARRIGA
I wasn’t expecting such a kind
face...

Owens is next to him now. He speaks in a thick WELSH BROGUE.

OWENS
The tech says his gizmo checks out.
But in complete candor I don’t like
this-- and I don’t like this boy.

GARRIGA
Why?

OWENS
He’s a con man, sir.

GARRIGA
That’s the point.

OWENS
I've dealt with guys like him when
I was at 85 Albert. Slippery fish.

GARRIGA
I did not say you had to trust him.
Just to be sure he does his job.
OWENS
That I will. My eyes are open and I
keep my 1911 well fed.

Garriga is amused.

GARRIGA
Invite him to lunch.

Owens nods even though Garriga has never removed his eyes
from the track.

EXT. RACETRACK LOUNGE - DAY

Before the huge windows in the empty dining area overlooking
the track, Garriga, Owens and Nicky have lunch.
67.

GARRIGA
You are a man known for great
skills of persuasion and deception.

Nicky nods gently.

GARRIGA (CONT'D)
You were very hard for me to find.

NICKY
I'd been out of it for a while.

GARRIGA
So why did you take my offer?

NICKY
Ran out of money.

Garriga smiles. He’s disarmingly charming.

GARRIGA

I love everything about what we do.
Drivers risk their lives for glory.
The competition, the constant
innovation, new materials, exotic
fabrication- all of it to gain a
fraction of a second on your
competition. It is a sport of
nanoseconds. Millions of dollars
to get the slightest edge.

(then)
My car- You saw it?

NICKY
Beautiful...

GARRIGA

Easily $400 million dollars in R
and D. Ferrari, McEwen, Lotus, they
spend half of that.

(then)
But still I have a problem. Ten
years ago at LeMans I was young and
I was drunk and I declared Team
Garriga would dominate the sport
within a decade. And over that
decade we have come very close.
This year McEwen is the only team
standing in my way.

(then)
But I have something none of them
have.
68.

NICKY
The EXR. The fuel burn algorithm.

GARRIGA
Yes, they all want it. My engineers
promise it guarantees me a win. But
that’s not enough for me. Perhaps I
am paranoid. Or perhaps I am too
proud. But I will not lose. That is
why I wanted you.

OWENS
This needs to be discreet. It needs
to be safe. No holes.

NICKY
The plan is as we’ve discussed. I
pose as a disgruntled contractor
offering to sell the EXR to the
McEwen Team. But that’s not what
I'll give them. I’11l give them a
fake designed by a friend of mine.
They’1l load it into their car's
tuning control unit. It will test
well- but it doesn’t do anything.
Basically it just gives a false
reading to their instruments. It’1ll
mislead the driver enough to give
you an added edge.

GARRIGA
How much of an edge?

NICKY
Not much. Two thirds of a second
every few laps? Imperceptible.
Undetectable.

GARRIGA
Two thirds of a second is a
gracious plenty.

Owens nods. Then-

OWENS
Just because the techs say it
checks out, what makes you think
you can convince them you're
absolutely real? That you’re
completely authentic? You can’t be
dicking around boy.
69.

NICKY
You don’t need to worry about that.
I’m well researched. We’re good to
go.
(then)
The Grand Prix Kickoff party at our
hotel tonight...

GARRIGA
Yes.

NICKY
I’ll be there early. I’1l be seen
drinking, bragging and boisterous.
At some point in the evening I'll
approach you in view of the McEwen
team. An argument ensues. I’1l
throw down my drink, I'll yell,
I‘1l shove you- Security will throw
me out. At that point it’1ll have
it’s own inertia. McEwen’11
probably contact me right there. If
not, I’1l go to him.

GARRIGA
Good.

NICKY
Just so we understand. Whatever I
sell it for- I keep all of it. Plus
the million from you.

Owens and Garriga agree.

EXT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NIGHT

Nestled into the beautiful city of Buenos Aires, a gorgeous
hip hotel plays host to a kickoff party of Grand Prix week.

Outside is a lavish affair where the race teams, dignitaries,
VIP spectators and generally fabulous folks enjoy themselves
as music thumps over it all.

Nicky arrives, working his way through the crowd. He passes
a RACE FAN COUPLE getting an autograph from a FAMOUS DRIVER.
The HUSBAND offers his camera to passing Nicky.

HUSBAND
Take our picture?

NICKY
Sure.
70.

Nicky gladly grabs the camera and quickly pops off a photo of
the couple and the driver.

NICKY (CONT'D)
One for safety...

He snaps another and returns the camera. Moving on, he spots
GARRIGA AND OWENS in a distant corner, regards them a moment,
then turns his gaze to ANOTHER SET OF VIP’S.

NICKY POV: A burly, ebullient AUSTRALIAN TEAM OWNER (MORGAN
MCEWEN, 50’s) hugs his DRIVER who wears a TEAM MCEWEN JACKET.

Nicky turns his attention to the BAR. He’s greeted by an
Argentine BARTENDER whose name tag reads, “MARCELLO”.

MARCELLO
(in SPANISH)
What may I get you sir?
NICKY
(in SPANISH)
Marcello, is it? I have a favor to
ask.
MARCELLO
Yes sir?
NICKY

I'm here on business with a client
who loves to drink. But I'ma
recovering alcoholic so when I
order a Vodka martini rocks can you
just give me water and olives
instead?

MARCELLO
(in English)
Of course sir. Understood.

NICKY
Vodka Martini. Rocks.

Marcello nods and prepares a drink.

EXT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

MUSIC as Nicky MINGLES at the party, talking to various
guests- LAUGHING, CHATTING and most of all, DRINKING.

ON NICKY, talking up a guest, “tipsy” and disparaging.
71.

NICKY
-.-he’s a real son of a bitch as
far as I’m concerned. Do you know
if Garriga is Spanish for thief?
(then)
Forget it. I don’t want to ruin the
party... sorry man...

In a BRIEF MONTAGE, we watch him grow increasingly “drunk” as
he downs several water Martinis.

He LAUGHS loudly and sloppily FLIRTS with a pretty woman-
briefly catching MCEWEN’S eye- just enough to make an
impression.

NICKY (CONT'D)
(pointing across room)

There he is right there. Commander

in Thief. Stole my designs. Could

have been millions in it for me.

Guess you can do whatever you want

if you're a rich prick...

PRETTY WOMAN
Maybe you should slow down a
little. Drink some water...

NICKY
No. I’m gonna talk to him. Its a
free country.

PRETTY WOMAN
Just calm down.

NICKY
I’m going...

He staggers off.

ON NICKY, heading across the room to Owens and Garriga.
Owens gives a subtle nod. Nicky acknowledges him.

But as he makes his way across to Garriga, he STOPS suddenly--
falling out of character. His face falls.

IT’S JESS, looking stunning in a gorgeous dress and making an
INCREDIBLE ENTRANCE from across the crowded space.

Confident on her heels, confident in all ways, she saunters
toward him with smoldering intensity. She seems a completely
different woman, but it’s definitely her.

Nicky is thrown for a loop as she comes closer. She doesn’t
see him but continues on, smiling at the sight of someone.
72.
Nicky turns to see who, only to find GARRIGA spreading his
arms at the sight of her.

She walks right into Garriga’s arms and gives him a more-than-
a-friend kiss.

Nicky tries to absorb this shocking development. Shaken, he
veers off course and heads for an EXIT.

CUT TO:
ON JESS, with Garriga, taking a sip from his drink.
JESS
Is this a Pisco Sour? I’1l have one

of these sweetie.

GARRIGA
Of course bonita...

And as Garriga orders a drink from a nearby WAITER, Jess
catches sight of Nicky leaving the party. She calmly
observes him and after a few moments leans close to Garriga.

JESS
I’m just gonna run to the ladies...

GARRIGA
Of course...
EXT. HOTEL TERRACE - NIGHT

Away from the party on a large terrace, Nicky looks out at
the beautiful grounds as he tries to process things.

After a few beats, the sound of women’s HEELS. He turns to
see Jess approaching. They silently size each other up.

JESS
Well hello.

NICKY
Hi.

JESS

What are you doing here?

NICKY
Just here for the race.
73.

JESS
Should be a good one.
(then, changing subject)
Long time.

NICKY
Yeah.
(then, changing subject)
So you're with um...?

JESS
Rafael Garriga. Yes. He owns one of
the teams.

Nicky pauses. Acknowledgment or a pang of jealousy?

NICKY
Oh. Great. Is he a mark?

JESS
No. We’re together. Have been for a
long time. I’m out of the game.

NICKY
Oh. Good. Good for you.
JESS
What about you?
NICKY
I--
JESS

I looked for you, you know.
Guilt plays behind his eyes.

NICKY
You shouldn’t have...

JESS
What was I supposed to do?

NICKY
Hate me. Forget me.

JESS
Is that what you did? Just forget?

NICKY
I made a mistake.
74.

JESS
What? Sleeping with me? Bringing me
in? Talking to me in that bar?

Before he can answer--

JESS (CONT'D)

You left me back at square one you
know? Wandering. So I did what you
said- worked alone. Got on the
party circuit, boosting watches and
traveling for a year before I met
Rafael in Valencia. We've been
together ever since. He’s a good
guy. Generous. Kind.

NICKY
Glad to hear it... I’m sorry if I--

JESS
No, you did me a favor. Rafael has
changed my entire life. I’m in
love. I’m happy. I should be
thanking you.
Nicky absorbs this. He smiles half-heartedly.

JESS (CONT'D)
Guess I’1ll see you around.

She gives a kiss on the cheek. A friend’s kiss.
JESS (CONT'D)
But look- he doesn’t know about my
past so-- you don’t know me. Okay?

He gets it, but it seems like it hurts to hear it.

NICKY
Yeah. Okay.

He’s left watching her walk away, regretful.

He reaches into his lapel pocket, searching for his wallet.
It’s still there.

EXT. HOTEL BAR AREA - LATER

Nicky bellies up to another bar at the party- raising a hand
to the BARTENDER.

NICKY
Vodka.
75.

The bartender places a drink before Nicky. Nicky takes a
gulp, but is quickly disappointed.

NICKY (CONT'D)
This is water.

BARTENDER
Yes sir. I have spoken with
Marcello.

Nicky looks across the party. Marcello looks back at him with
a big thumbs up. Nicky tries again.

NICKY
Give me a real one.
BARTENDER
Sir, I couldn't.
NICKY
It’s okay. I need a drink. Several
actually.
BARTENDER

He told me to be strong for you.

NICKY
I’1ll talk to Marcello.

EXT. HOTEL - MARCELLO’S BAR - MOMENTS LATER
Nicky bellies up to Marcello’s bar.

NICKY
Okay Marcello, you did a great job.
We're good now. But I really need a
drink so I want you to make me real
one. Alright?

MARCELLO
Understood sir.

NICKY
Actually make it a double.

MARCELLO
Coming right up.

CUT TO:

Marcello pours a huge one into a glass in front of Nicky. He
takes a swig.
76.

NICKY
This is water.

MARCELLO
(to be heard)
No sir, it is a real drink.
Absolutely one hundred percent
genuine.

NICKY
Who are you talking to? Just give
me a drink.

MARCELLO
I misunderstood sir. I’m sorry...

He turns to make another.

NICKY
No- do it here. Do it right in
front of me.

Marcello complies and begins to make the drink right before
him with the proper ingredients.

MARCELLO
What do I care? It is not my life.
What does it matter if you come
home at three a.m? If you yell and
scream at your wife while your
children cower under the bed afraid
for their mother’s life? Until one
day, one of those children comes
out from beneath the bed and pushes
YOU against the wall and yells NO
MORE PAPI! NO MORE! I am the man of
this family now and you can go to
hell!

Marcello places the drink in front of Nicky. He picks it up,
ignoring what he just heard and holds it in front of his lips
for a long beat. Then, guiltily-

NICKY
Fuck you Marcello.

He slams down the drink and storms off. Marcello is proud of
his tough love.
EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

ON A WAITER with a trayful of drinks. Nicky CUTS HIM OFF,
stopping him in his tracks.
77.

Nicky grabs the tray- and stares down the waiter until he
lets go of it.

EXT. HOTEL POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS

On Nicky, sitting on the diving board, drinking while
watching Jess and Garriga from afar. The tray is next to him,

half of the glasses are empty.

He remains indifferent as Owens joins him.

OWENS
Are you drunk?

NICKY
No.

OWENS

What part of the plan calls for a
tray full of Lemon Drops, Apple-
tinis, and Goldschlager shots? Are
you pledging a sorority house?

NICKY
I think I may need to rethink the
plan.

OWENS
Why? What’s going on? Something
wrong?

NICKY

No. I’m just not feeling it.

OWENS
You're not feeling it? This isn’t
Jazzfest, Thelonious. What’s your
reason?

NICKY
Nothing. Forget it. I’m fine. Just
waiting for the right time.

OWENS
You sure? Mr. Garriga is not a guy
you want to cross... me neither.

So if there’s something you need to
say, say it.

NICKY
I said it. I’m waiting for the
right time.
78.

OWENS
God damned primadonna delicate
science bullshit. You’re not
smashing atoms here. This isn’t
CERN. Just do what you’re being
paid to do.
(mutters )
Shitheel...

Owens exits. Nicky shoots back another drink.

EXT. HOTEL VIP AREA - NIGHT
Garriga and Jess LAUGH at an unheard joke. She swats him.

JESS
Rafael!!

GARRIGA
Funny, right?

NICKY (0.S.)
Hey you!!!

They turn to see a very drunk Nicky standing nearby. Owens
is tense. Jess is freaked out.

JESS
Oh God...

GARRIGA
Don’t worry. He’s a disgruntled
engineer.

SMASH! Nicky throws down his glass. Many guests, including
McEwen turn.

GARRIGA (CONT’D)
I expect you have to something to
say to m--

WHACK! Nicky knocks Garriga off his feet with a very
unexpected punch to the face.

OWENS
(surprised by punch)
Oh shit--
JESS

What are you doing!?

Garriga hits the ground as the whole room turns to watch.
McEwen is one of them. Owens rushes in as--
79.

WHAM!! Nicky dives atop Garriga, punching and wrestling with
him as Owens tries to pull him off.

GARRIGA
(to Nicky)
Why are you punching me? (WHACK) I
thought we were shoving. (WHACK)
NICKY
You take my ideas, you claim them
as you’re own. You stole from me!!
ON JESS: Not sure how to react.
ON NICKY, wildly attacking Garriga.

NICKY (CONT'D)
I’M SO DISGRUNTLED!!!

Owens and party SECURITY finally peel him off Garriga as Jess
tries to figure out what’s going on.

GARRIGA
Get him out of here!

MCEWEN watches as they drag Nicky away while Garriga tries to
urge the guests to resume enjoying the party. McEwen turns
and whispers something to his BODYGUARD standing next to him.
ON OWENS, yanking Nicky and whispering in his ear.

OWENS
Oversold it a bit didn’t you?

NICKY
I was caught in the moment...

Owens shoves him off, letting security take him out the rest
of the way.

ON JESS, icing Garriga’'s face as he sits recovering.

JESS
What was that?
GARRIGA
The racing business bonita. That’s

all...

INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

Security escorts Nicky out of the party and across the lobby
toward the front door.
80.

NICKY
You can’t throw me out-- I’m
staying here.

MASSIVE SECURITY GUARD
Let’s see your key.

Nicky digs in his pocket and produces his KEYCARD.
Satisfied, they THROW HIM to the floor and walk away.

Nicky lays on the refreshingly cool marble of the lobby floor
when TWO FEET settle to a stop next to his head.

He looks up to find McEwen’s hulking bodyguard, GORDON,
looking down at him.

GORDON
Mr. McEwen would like to have lunch
in his suite tomorrow. Information
is on the card.

Gordon drops a card on his chest and walks off. Nicky smiles
and slowly rises to his feet to make his way to his room so
that he can spend the night vomiting.

FADE OUT.

I/E. MCEWEN’S SUITE - DAY

Gordon lets Nicky into the palatial suite and escorts him
into the living room area. The drapes dance on the breeze
blowing in from the balcony doors.

Corpulent McEwen is outside, enjoying the view. MUSIC from
the pool area below can be heard as Nicky joins him by the
railing. They stare outward, side by side.

A long pause, then-

MCEWEN

Ever heard of Udo Pappenphus?
NICKY

No sir.
MCEWEN

An engineer for Ferrari for many
years. Brilliant. Moved on a few
times. McLaren, Toyota, different
teams. A fun fellow. Curious
fellow. With a name like Udo
Pappenphus you’d damn well better
be fun and curious...
81.

He has Nicky’s attention.

MCEWEN (CONT'D)
Well one day, Udo Pappenphus was
found behind a berm with his throat
cut ear to ear. Like a giant grin.
(then)
Udo Pappenphus, a corporate spy?
No. Udo Pappenphus was a good
father, a brilliant engineer and a
stupid cunt. Udo Pappenphus brought
home a one inch square of
experimental honeycomb carbon
composite to show his 10 year old
son...
(by rote)
..-and they cut his throat from ear
to ear like a giant grin or so the
story goes.

It hangs there.

MCEWEN (CONT'D)

Why tell you this tale? Other than
the fact I like the sound of Udo
Pappenphus as it strolls across my
tongue? It’s a warning... of what
you're getting yourself into. He
was Garriga’s man.

NICKY
I want three million dollars.

MCEWEN
That’s a lot of money.

NICKY
It’s the EXR.

MCEWEN
(surprised)
Great God almighty...
Nicky stares down at the pool party below.

NICKY
Mmm hmm...

NICKY POV: Jess is walking through the crowded pool area in a
sexy outfit.
82.

MCEWEN
I thought maybe you’d have some
shit like a dropped cockpit- blown
diffuser nonsense...

Nicky doesn’t answer, distracted.
MCEWEN (CONT'D)

But the EXR? You’re Father Bloody
Christmas come to me.

NICKY
(distracted)

Uh huh...
MCEWEN

It’s mine anyway- God knows he
stole all my engineers from me.

As McEwen talks, Nicky walks along the railing to get a
better look at her.

MCEWEN (CONT'D)
I’m going to need to see proof.

Nicky watches as Jess embraces Garriga, leaving McEwen
waiting for an answer.

MCEWEN (CONT'D)
Do you understand?

Still no answer from staring Nicky.

MCEWEN (CONT'D)
What the hell are you looking at?

Nicky snaps out of it as McEwen glances down to see.

NICKY
What?

MCEWEN
Did the pool go Euro?
(to inside)
Gordon! Get my field glasses.

McEwen squints, spotting Jess.

MCEWEN (CONT'D)

Ahhh. I see the one. She’s a
beauty. Bet she’s one of those
Formula One skanks who follows the
circuit.
83.

NICKY
(offended)
She’s not a race skank.
MCEWEN
Oh- do you know her?
NICKY
No, I’m just not getting a skanky
vibe.
MCEWEN
Oh sure she is. The hotel’s lousy
with them.
NICKY

She looks like a very nice girl.

MCEWEN
Sure. For the right price.

McEwen laughs. Nicky scowls as McEwen keeps leering.

MCEWEN (CONT'D)
Gah. Look at her buttocks.
(inside)
Gordon! Field glasses! Now!!
(then)
Chiseled marble lobes...

NICKY
(bothered)
Okay, can we get back to business?

MCEWEN
A little small on top, but who
cares?

NICKY
(wanting to punch him)
That's a very subjective topic.
One man’s small is another man’s
perfection.

MCEWEN
Maybe if you're booking a fashion
show, but I’m talking about
slapping balls!!

NICKY
(annoyed, short)
Listen- Do you want the stuff or
not?
84.

MCEWEN
Of course I do. GORDON GET ME MY
FIELD GLASSES YOU MOUTH BREATHING
YABBY!
(then, to Nicky)
But I’m gonna need proof first.

NICKY
You'll have it. I’11 contact you.
Then it’s three million. Cash.

Nicky exits, running into bodyguard GORDON as he’s delivering
SMALL BINOCULARS to McEwen.

Nicky grabs them from him and quickly breaks them in half.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Sorry.

He gives them back and exits.

EXT. POOL AREA BAR —- DAY

A cloistered pool bar partially separated from the pool area
by tall landscaping. Jess arrives with an empty glass. A
BLONDE BARTENDER helps her.

BLONDE BARTENDER
Sangria?

Jess nods as the bartender tops off her glass. Nicky appears
behind her.

NICKY
Let me get this one...

Jess is not pleased.

JESS
What are you doing?

NICKY
Just having a drink.

JESS
You don’t know me, remember?

NICKY
Just having a drink. Stranger.

JESS
What was that last night? Was that
about me?
85.

NICKY
No.
(then)
Well, a little bit about you.

JESS
Are you working an angle on Rafael?

NICKY
No. I’m working for him. It’s
nothing. Trust me.

JESS
Trust you. Of course.

NICKY
I know. I deserve that-- but...
when you grow up in this- with a
father like mine, you don’t just
trust people. It’s not done. It’s--

JESS
Is that it? It’s all your dad’s
fault? I get it. I forgive you
okay? But if Rafael sees us, I
don’t know what’s gonna happen.
He’s the jealous type. Goodbye.

NICKY
You're missing the point.
JESS
Oh really? Then tell me- what’s the
point?
NICKY
The point is... I don’t know what

the point is. A chance to explain?
Talk? I don’t know- make it up to
you?

She thinks. She’s wrestling with something. A deep breath,
a big sigh, then-

JESS
To be perfectly honest. I was kind
of happy to see you. It’s just-- I
mean, three years is a long time. I
guess I should just get over it...

Nicky leaves a silence, hoping she’1ll say more.
86.

JESS (CONT'D)

Things with Rafael are...
complicated. I was just painting a
pretty picture. I mean, things are
fine but... it’s a strange world
and sometimes...

She drifts off in thought for a moment, a vulnerability
behind her eyes.

JESS (CONT'D)

I could actually use a... a
distraction. You know? I get
lonely here. He’s so busy...

Her eyes start to well. She gathers herself.

JESS (CONT'D)
God- I must sound like such a train

wreck...
NICKY
No. No, no... not at all.
JESS
(big sigh)

It was fun in Miami wasn’t it?
Nicky smiles and nods. She moves closer.

JESS (CONT'D)
I kind of miss the game. I miss
you.

(she thinks)
If I were to slip away. I mean, if
I could... do you think...?

(then)
It’s a mistake, forget it.

He leans in, seeing his chance.

NICKY
We can do whatever you want to do.
I can keep you safe...

She leans in even closer, whispering-

JESS
You taught me so much. But I’ve
learned a lot since then. I'd
really love to show you all the
things I’ve learned...

Nicky would like that. She moves toward his lips.
87.

A KISS, gentle but simmering. Once it ends-

JESS (CONT'D)
Like how I learned how to play men
like I just played you.

Nicky instantly backs off, chiding himself. Jess smiles and
skewers him.

JESS (CONT'D)
You're pathetic. I think you’re
losing it.

NICKY
When did you learn that?

JESS
“I'll keep you safe?” BLECH! What
the hell was that? Does that get
you laid?

NICKY
That was not a line!

JESS
I'm not falling for your shit again
Nicky. And I’m very happy. Stay
away from me.
She walks away. Nicky admonishes himself. Then--

JESS (CONT'D)
And you're still an easy lift...

She tosses back his wallet as she disappears from view,
leaving Nicky wanting her more than ever.

FADE OUT:

EXT. ALEXANDER MCQUEEN BOUTIQUE - DAY

Jess emerges from Garriga’s Escalade and an Argentine
SALESWOMAN opens the door to greet her.

SALESWOMAN
We've been expecting you...
INT. ALEXANDER MCQUEEN FITTING AREA - DAY

Splendid dresses all around.
88.

SALESWOMAN (0.S.)
Seflor Garriga’s assistant called.
We pulled a few things they said
you might like...

Jess is at the mirror decked out in an amazing dress as the
saleswoman stands beside her.

JESS
I think this one would just about
kill him.

SALESWOMAN

It’s breathtaking, is it not?

It is.

EXT. BUENOS AIRES STREET - LATER
Jess is laden with bags, continuing her shopping expedition.

Passing a BUS STOP where several ELDERLY PEOPLE get on a bus,
she notices a PURSE on the ground nearby. She tries to get
the attention of the boarding passengers...

JESS
Whoa whoa-- wait! Hello? Hello!
(realizing)
I mean hola! Wait...

Too late-- the bus door CLOSES and it pulls away. Frustrated
for a moment, Jess is overcome by a touch of her pickpocket
past as she picks up the purse.

She looks around quickly then digs into the purse. Not much-
an ADDRESS BOOK, some KEYS and a WALLET with a few PESOS and
PICTURES of a SWEET OLD COUPLE - The wife beaming and the
husband in a WHEELCHAIR.

She is overcome with guilt. She flips to the first page of
the address book and quickly finds the woman’s information.

She dials the number. An OLD MAN answers.

OLD MAN (0.S.)
Hola?

JESS
Hola-- um, hi, your wife, um--
espousa? She--

OLD MAN (0.S.)
Que?
89.
JESS
Habla ingles?

OLD MAN (0.S.)
Que? No habla--

CLICK. He hangs up. Jess is stymied for a moment, then--

EXT. BUENOS AIRES SIDE STREET/COURTYARD - LATER
Jess scans building numbers, referring to the address book
periodically. The Escalade follows her slowly. She comes
upon a residential COURTYARD, entering to find--

NICKY
So you do still have a heart.

Grinning Nicky is seated at a garden table in the courtyard
with an open bottle of Malbec and two glasses. Jess is pissed

JESS
Oh God! Seriously?

NICKY
(as old man)
Si, estoy muy en serio.
She tosses the address book at him.
JESS
You are a dick! Stop wasting my
time!
She stomps off. He follows.
NICKY
C’mon just sit with me. Have a
little wine. Isn’t this romantic?

JESS
Yes! Stalking really turns my crank

She gets inside the Escalade and it drives off.

INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

Jess huffs at her situation when, DING! Her phone receives
a TEXT. She looks down to read--

"Sorry"

DING! Another text:
90.

“Didn't know how else to get your number"

JESS
Dammit...

She’s mad at herself, but also a little amused...

INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NICKY’S ROOM - NIGHT

It’s late. Nicky lounges on his bed, watching A_La Cama Con
Porcel on TV, eating gummy bears and drinking a beer.

DING. His phone lights up with a TEXT. It’s Jess.

“What's the matter? Can't sleep?”

He quickly sits up, spilling his beer. He thinks a moment.
DING. Another text: “Your light is still on.”

He looks to the window. Is she watching?

DING. Another text. “Be at the terrace garden in 5.”

A smile. He springs into action-- putting on a shirt and
quickly freshening up in the bathroom mirror.

He EXITS.

Beat.

He re-enters, smelling his armpits. Quickly applies
deodorant, leaves again.

EXT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL GARDEN - NIGHT

Nicky arrives at the garden on the hotel grounds. He looks
for Jess. No sign of her.

DING. A text: “Turn around”

He slowly turns. He’s facing the hotel.

DING. “Look up”

He does. Scanning upward a few floors until he sees--

Jess, in heavy shadow, silhouetted by the light spilling from
her suite.
91.
He watches as she slowly undoes the sash of her robe, not yet
opening it.

She turns and moves inside, diffused by the sheer curtains
and warm light inside.

Nicky walks with her as she enters the bedroom. He's rapt,
not noticing as he walks through a manicured flower bed.

She stops, her back to him, still diffused by the curtains.
He stops and watches as she DROPS HER ROBE. Although
obscured slightly by the curtains, he can see her turn her
head and he can discern a sly smile. Then--

Garriga enters the bedroom, shirtless, hairy and libidinous.

She turns to him and embraces him.

Nicky shoulders his disappointment and frustration as they
vanish from view.

FADE OUT.

EXT. TEST TRACK - DAY

A McEwen F-1 car on a test run speeds past the pit where the
McEwen team is gathered.

Nicky, McEwen and a McEwen TECH are huddled around a laptop.

MCEWEN
Well?

TECH
It’s real.

McEwen looks to Nicky.

MCEWEN
Three million huh?

NICKY
I can have the entire package
within 48 hours. Code,
documentation, analysis.
McEwen agrees.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Wait for my call.

Nicky closes the laptop and exits.
92.

EXT. BUENOS AIRES AIRPORT - DAY

Nicky pulls up outside the baggage claim area in his SUV,
glancing inside.

I/E. BUENOS AIRES AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON rolling LUGGAGE and FEET, purposefully walking to
the exit, PASSING THROUGH THE SLIDING DOORS and approaching
Nicky's car.

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Fat Farhad sits in the back of the car as Nicky drives.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Is the chimichurri good? Love that

shit.

NICKY
I’ll take you for asado. I owe you
one.

FAT ASS FARHAD
What’s with the coach seat?

NICKY
Sorry, last minute.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Godamnned connection in Sao Paolo?
Airport’s like JFK if it was in
Mogadishu. Orange fucking tile
gives me a headache.

NICKY
I'll make it up to you.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Damn right. They had me squeezed
between two fat guys. I swear we
flew at a 45 degree angle the whole
way down.

NICKY
Are you done complaining? There’s a
time issue.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Don’t question my professionalism.
If I have a pulmonary embolism, let
it hang on your head.
93.

NICKY
I told you to get up and walk every
hour. Did you get up and walk
every hour?

FAT ASS FARHAD
Why? So I can stand in front of a
bathroom door I can’t fit through?
Me and the fat guys were pissing in
Aquafina bottles like long haul
truckers.

NICKY
Sorry. Are you done?

FAT ASS FARHAD
You better have booked me a nice

hotel too.

NICKY
Motel.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Motel?!

NICKY
It’s actually nice. I checked it
out. Now are you done?

FAT ASS FARHAD
Yeah, just had to vent.
(then)
Where’s this going down?

Nicky points to a GPS like device, tracking something.

NICKY
Not sure yet. Mark is on the move.
Public though.

FAT ASS FARHAD
You sure about this? This isn’t my
speciality-

NICKY
Why are you still complaining? I’m
giving you a cut-

FAT ASS FARHAD
I haven't heard from you in a year.
And you haven't gigged in three
from what I hear, so forgive me my
impertinence.
94.
Nicky isn’t going to argue anymore.
EXT. PUBLIC SQUARE - DAY
A busy public square lined with shops, cafes, merchants, etc.

Nicky pulls in and parks.

INT. NICKY’S CAR - DAY

Nicky and Farhad scan the sea of crowded tables outside.

NICKY
Back there- next to the guy in the
yellow.
(then)

You got the piece?
FAT ASS FARHAD
In my bag.
EXT. SQUARE - DAY
Farhad carries a small bag as he works his way through the
crowded area. He negotiates his way past tables, eyeing

passersby wearily.

He turns his gaze ahead, locking in then palms the side
pocket of his bag, checking for the mysterious contents.

FARHAD POV: The crowd parts, revealing his mark at a table--

FAT ASS FARHAD
Hey there.

It’s JESS. She looks up to see him, pleasantly surprised.

JESS
Farhad!

FAT ASS FARHAD
Jess.

She leaps to her feet and they hug.
JESS
Oh my god! You’ve lost so much
weight!

He looks exactly the same.
They do.

95.

FAT ASS FARHAD
I did a cleanse.

JESS
You here with Nicky?

FAT ASS FARHAD
Sort of. Can I bend your ear?

JESS
Sure, sit down...

FAT ASS FARHAD
You've got Nicky all nuts.

JESS
I do? Good.

FAT ASS FARHAD
I’ve never seen him like this. You
know he hasn’t worked since Miami?

JESS
Seriously?

FAT ASS FARHAD
I know he’s an asshole. I mean, a
really big asshole. But he’s my
friend and I’m going to bat for
him. Can’t you give the asshole a
break?

JESS
Okay, he flew you down here just to
talk to me?

FAT ASS FARHAD
He knew you and me hit it off in
Miami with me showing you pictures
of my family and my dick and all.

JESS
Well yeah, that was special.

FAT ASS FARHAD
I don’t know- I think he thought
that maybe you would listen to me
being that we was so close.

JESS
I don’t know what to say Farhad,
it’s been a long time.
96.

FAT ASS FARHAD
He told me you got a thing going
with this Spanish dude, what’s his

face...

JESS
Yeah well that’s where things get
complex...

CUT TO:

ON NICKY, watching from the car, squinting at Farhad and Jess
through the crowd.

They gab and eventually LAUGH uproariously.
BACK TO:
Farhad and Jess continue their conversation.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Nothing in life is easy you know?

JESS
Listen- I know what he is. He may
be obsessed with me now, but he’1l
forget about me just like he did
before.

FAT ASS FARHAD
I don’t think you’ve got that
right. He seems different... and
I’ve known him a long time.

JESS
Yeah?

Farhad pulls a small box from his bag and hands it to her.
JESS (CONT'D)
(opening it)
What is it...?

She lifts the lid to find the DECO STYLE GARNET NECKLACE she
coveted way back in Miami.

FAT ASS FARHAD
He kept it for you. All this time.

Her eyes say it all.
97.

EXT. CAMINITO LA BOCA DISTRICT - DAY

Jess and Nicky walk along the blocks of brightly painted
homes in the historical neighborhood.

The mood is a bit awkward, but it’s a start.

JESS
So I’m here. What’d you want to say
to me?

NICKY

This feels like a job interview.

JESS
I don’t have all day.

NICKY
So cold. You’ve changed.

JESS
No. This isn’t how I treat people,
it’s how I treat you.

NICKY
So you're saying I have a special
place in your heart?

JESS
I don’t know about my heart.
Something south of that. It might
be pollups.

NICKY
You’re making this so easy.

JESS
No problem. I can’t wait for the
sucking sound of your empty
platitudes.

NICKY
You are so mean. I hope you’re not
a pet owner because you are
definitely a kick the dog type.

JESS
I have a lizard. You'd get along.

NICKY
Again with the mean. Have pity.

She stops him and makes eye contact.
98.

JESS
You. Are. A dick.

She turns and walks away.

She stops.

NICKY
I totally lost it, okay?

Turns around.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Never happened to me before. Never.
(stream of conscious)
I was laying there that night and I
couldn’t sleep and I was just
looking at you and I was totally
prepared to tell you anything.
Whatever you wanted to hear.
Everything. All my secrets...

JESS
Oh Jesus...
NICKY
That’s never happened to me. I- I -
I had images of us, like... like...
JESS
What?
NICKY

Like... together.

JESS
Like sexy stuff?

NICKY
No! Like normal stuff! Like camping
at Yosemite. Driving to Big Sur.
Eating crab at Fisherman's Wharf.
It was all in California for some
reason-- which is weird because
I’ve only been there once when I
was eight and I’m allergic to
shellfish.

JESS
I’m allergic to shellfish.

NICKY
Really? See how well we’re hitting
it off?
99.

JESS
Okay- we need to find someplace to
sit ‘cause I think you’re having a
meltdown.

EXT. PLAZOLETA DE LOS SUSPIROS - A SHORT TIME LATER

Jess and Nicky sit at the edge of a QUAINT WHARF overlooking
a harbor at the edge of the neighborhood. Colorful tugs and
fishing boats are moored nearby as Jess PUTS THE NECKLACE ON.

NICKY
Looks nice.

Jess accepts the compliment but changes the subject.

JESS
Farhad said you didn’t work for a
long time...

NICKY
Couple years, yeah. Didn’t feel
right. Actually started feeling bad
about doing it... which is not
something you want ina
professional con artist. Empathy, a
heart... what a disaster.

JESS
Yeah. God forbid.

NICKY
Seriously. Not so much about the
rich guys. But I think about some
of the ones when I was little. My
dad and I would run this scheme at
these churches. I’d speak in
tongues and he’d translate for a
donation. What happened to those
people? Or when I was 15, I rana
credit card scam on this video
store in Pennsylvania- back when
they had the carbon paper slips? I
drove back there last year and it’s
not there. Video store was gone.

JESS
Don’t you think that was online
streaming? Or Netflix or the big
red thing at the grocery stores?

NICKY
What is that thing?
100.

JESS
Don’t tell me you blame yourself
for Borders Books too.

NICKY
No. That was the Kindle.

JESS
Wow you really have become a wuss.

NICKY
It was a crisis of faith.

JESS
All brought on by sleeping with me?

NICKY
RedBox! That’s the thing at the
grocery store.

JESS
Did you just say that? Was that a
naughty inference?

NICKY
I think so.

JESS
Maybe you’re not such a wuss.

Smiles. Then--

NICKY
I even reached out to my dad.
Hadn't seen him in years. We
buried a lot of our crap. Asked him
if he’d ever gone straight. He was
like, “I go straight every time I’m
on parole.” He told me that you
can’t live this life and then not
live it. ‘Be a man and move on...’

JESS
And?

NICKY
I’m working on it.

Jess thinks a moment, reflecting.
101.

JESS
You said this was no way to live.
That I’d never be able to trust
anyone. I didn’t believe you then,
but I do now. I cut myself off.

NICKY
All brought on by sleeping with me?

JESS
I was headed that way anyway. It
wasn't that big of a deal.

NICKY
Was that a dig?

JESS
Just a little one.

NICKY
Clever.

JESS

Why’d you go to all this trouble
Nicky. Absolution? Forgiveness?
Piece of mind? What?

NICKY
I can convince anyone of anything.
One time I convinced a man that an
empty warehouse with a single chair
in it was the federal reserve. So
I’m good. A good liar.

JESS
Yeah. You’re the best.

NICKY
But what I wanted to do was tell
you the truth. To tell you the
truth and to look into your eyes
and...
(inhales)
I just need for you to believe me.

They stare at one another. Nicky awaits her answer.
JESS
I want to believe you Nicky. I
really do.

He’s disappointed.
102.
JESS (CONT'D)
I have to go.

MUSIC. He watches as she walks away, late afternoon sun
warmly reflecting off of her.

She approaches a TAXI and gets in. Nicky turns his gaze to
the sun setting on the harbor.

It’s not long before Farhad ambles up behind him and rests a
sympathetic hand on his shoulder.

FAT ASS FARHAD
Let’s get something to eat.
INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
A sullen Nicky rides the elevator. It stops. A COUPLE
boards. Down the hall an ELDERLY WOMAN makes her way toward

the door. She looks up just as the door closes.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Por favor.

Nicky put his arm out and holds the door. The woman enters.

ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT’D)
Gracias.

NICKY
De nada.
INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open. Nicky exits and makes his way back
to his room when he STOPS--

Jess sits at his door. She rises, she looks shaken, possibly
roughed up. He goes to her, quick to console.

NICKY

What happened? What’s wrong?
JESS

I don’t want to talk about it.
NICKY

Did he--
JESS

Just kiss me.
103.

He does. A loving kiss that’s been a long time in the making.
They quickly lose themselves as he backs her to the door.

Never breaking their embrace, Jess reaches into Nicky’s
pocket and pulls out his room key. Blindly fumbling for the
lock, Jess continues to kiss him as the door opens to reveal
a short HALLWAY leading to the bedroom.

CAMERA FOLLOWS SLOWLY as Jess and Nicky stumble down the
hallway, locked into each other, heading toward the BEDROOM.

CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY as they land on the bed and continue.
MATCH DISSOLVE:
CAMERA CONTINUES to move in as DAYLIGHT fills the bedroom and
arrives at the bed to settle on the couple intertwined with
one another the NEXT MORNING.
MUSICAL INTERLUDE as they look at one another, communicating
only with long looks and smiles- each enjoying the other’s
company without a word.

It’s a simple and pure moment, not cloying or forced. Totally
candid and unadorned, they are at once playful and loving.

Eventually Nicky’s face grows a touch more serious. There’s
something he has to say. Then-

NICKY
I’m leaving soon.

Conflict, concern play across Jess’ face but she says nothing

NICKY (CONT'D)
Come with me.

She clearly wants to but doesn’t say. He grasps for a reason.
NICKY (CONT'D)

I know you think you love him but I
want you to come with me. Tonight.

JESS
Nicky... I don’t love him. But the
thing is -
NICKY
You can’t trust me.
(then)

I know and it probably serves me
right. But I’ve changed and I know
I can’t prove that but I’ve
changed.
104.

JESS
Nicky there’s something -

NICKY
He’s going to be at the track. Go
get your stuff and come back here.
I just have to finish my business
and we’ll be gone.

She sighs. Unsure where to begin. But before she can say-
Nicky’s phone RINGS.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Shit...
(looks at phone)
It’s Owens. I gotta take it.

She grows concerned. He answers.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Hey.

OWENS (0.S.)
Where are you?

NICKY
Just in my room.

OWENS (0.S.)
Good. I’m at the door.

Nicky hangs up, wincing.

NICKY
He’s here.

Nicky gets up, grabs his pants as Jess puts on a nearby ROBE.

ON NICKY, heading down the hall for the front door, passing a
DIVIDER WALL that separates the bed and bath section of the
suite from the living area.

He opens the door to reveal a suspicious Owens holding a
SMALL PACKAGE. Nicky plays it cool.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Hey...

Owens comes in uninvited. Nicky leads him to the living area.
OWENS

Still sleeping? I thought you were
meeting with McEwen...
105.

NICKY
I’m on it. I have time.
OWENS
Yeah?
NICKY
Yeah.
OWENS

There’s a lazy Sunday softness to
your generation-- makes me
uncomfortable.

Owens wanders along the living area. It’s obvious he’s
looking for something or someone.

OWENS (CONT'D)
I like to be on my feet. I'11 lay
down when I get cancer. Or if I
fuck. Both of which will be done on
my back in case you were wondering.

He heads for the OPEN FRENCH DOORS that lead to the BEDROOM.

NICKY
I’m glad you decided to share your
life philosophy with me. I’m
already seeing the world ina
different light.

Owens arrives at the FRENCH DOORS just as Jess is DUCKING OUT
the other BEDROOM DOOR, CLOSING IT as she goes.

OWENS
Sarcasm. Another pillar of your
generation. You want to tell
somebody to fuck off, tell ‘em to
fuck off. Don’t say, ‘gee, what a
great jacket.’ It’s weakness.

Nicky rolls his eyes as Owens glances through to the bed.

OWENS (CONT'D)
That’s a messy bed.

NICKY
I don’t sleep well.

ON JESS, heading for the front door.

BACK ON OWENS, entering the bedroom.
106.

OWENS
Someone here?

NICKY
No.

Owens GRABS THE KNOB of the main bedroom door.
ON JESS, trying to quietly open the front door when--

OWENS OPENS the bedroom door, forcing her to duck into the
living room.

OWENS
You know why you don’t sleep well?
Added complexity to the point of
distraction.

He closes the door behind him and wanders down the hallway
that leads to the front door. JESS is on the other side of
the dividing wall in the living area, matching his pace.

OWENS (CONT'D)
All of you with your phones and
computers that bring nothing but a
barrage of useless information.

Nicky gets in front of him, hoping to lead him to the door
and facilitate his exit-- not noticing Owens grabbing a SMALL
TRASH CAN and setting a trap for Jess by putting it in front
of the bedroom door.

OWENS (CONT'D)
Fucking Twitter? Like anyone really
cares that you’re eating a turkey
sandwich for lunch.

(realizing)
Sorry... ‘Panini.’
NICKY
Sarcasm?
OWENS
Satire.
NICKY

Are you here for a reason?

OWENS
Who'd you pick up at the airport?

ON JESS, on the other side of the dividing wall. She catches
sight of the trap Owens laid- she can’t go through the
bedroom again.
107.

Nicky arrives at the door first, glancing back at the living
area and CATCHES A GLIMPSE of Jess SLIPPING ONTO THE BALCONY.

NICKY
Garriga has you following me?

OWENS
I got people there.

NICKY
He’s my computer guy.

Owens blows past him and re-enters the living area.

OWENS
Why? Is there a problem?

NICKY
There won’t be. Because he came.

OWENS
I got a little red hair on my taint
that tickles when something's
afoot. Lately I’ve been scratching
my nethers like a fucking Macaque.

He wanders toward the balcony. Nicky follows.

NICKY
Look. Nothing’s going on.
Everything’s on schedule. We’re
wrapping up. No one should get
spooked just because we’re near the
end.

This stops Owens for a moment- just short of the balcony. He
turns. He sizes Nicky up. Nicky gestures to the front door.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Now come on. Let me do my job.

Owens stares him down. And just when it seems he’s satisfied-
He turns and walks onto the balcony. Nicky cringes,

following him out to find--

EXT. BALCONY - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

NOTHING. Jess isn’t there, only Owens. He stares out at the
grounds resolutely.

OWENS
Nice day.
108.

He goes back inside, leaving Nicky looking around for Jess.
He looks to the NEXT BALCONY. The gap is impossibly wide, but-

JESS POKES HER HEAD UP. Somehow she made the jump and, from
the look of her it was terrifying. She’s rattled to the bone.

He mouths, ‘You okay?’ She manages a nod. He pulls his ROOM
KEY from his pocket and tosses it to her. She catches it.

He pantomimes, “Meet here. 7 O’clock...” then heads inside.

INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NICKY’S ROOM -— CONTINUOUS

Nicky enters to find Owens placing the small package on the
table and LOOKING AT HIS WATCH--

OWENS
Call us when you finish with
McEwen.

NICKY
Will you stop worrying? I’m on my
way.

EXT. MCEWEN TEST TRACK — DAY

In the pit, Nicky, McEwen and the Tech sit before monitors
that display the Garriga information. McEwen smiles broadly
and slaps him on the back.

TECH
Incredible...

MCEWEN
You're my favorite person. I swear
you're six inches taller and twice
as handsome as when you walked in
here.

Gordon the bodyguard approaches on McEwen’s signal and places
a bag of cash in front of Nicky. He shakes with McEwen.

NICKY
It’s been a pleasure, Mr. McEwen. I
wish you the best of luck.

MCEWEN
With friends like you, who needs
luck?

McEwen and his men laugh at his joke. Nicky joins in.
109.

EXT. BUENOS AIRES OUTSKIRTS - DAY

MUSIC as Nicky drives his rental car with 3 million dollars
in a bag at his side. He dials his cell, awaits an answer.

NICKY
(into phone)
Mr. Garriga? It’s done. I wish you
the best of luck.

GARRIGA (0.S.)
With friends like you? Who needs
luck?

Nicky smiles as Garriga LAUGHS. He hangs up and speeds down
the road.
EXT. BUENOS AIRES INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

MUSIC CONTINUES as Nicky pulls into a high end industrial
park arriving at the open garages of the LOTUS RACING TEAM.

He’s greeted by the LOTUS HEAD ENGINEER.

INT. LOTUS WORKSHOP - DAY

Nicky, the Head Lotus Engineer and a Lotus Tech sit before
monitors that display the Garriga information. The Engineer
smiles broadly and slaps him on the back.

LOTUS ENGINEER
Worth every penny.

A bag of cash is placed in front of Nicky. He shakes hands
with the Engineer.

NICKY
It’s been a pleasure, Mr.
Gallagher. I wish you the best of
luck.

LOTUS ENGINEER
With friends like you, who needs
luck?

The Lotus guys laugh at his joke. Nicky joins in.
110.

EXT. BUENOS AIRES HIGHWAY - DAY
MUSIC CONTINUES as Nicky drives his rental car with 6 million

dollars in the TWO BAGS at his side. He speeds down the road
with a satisfied grin.

EXT. TEAM RED BULL-RENAULT PIT - DAY

Nicky, the Head RENAULT ENGINEER and a RENAULT TECH sit
before monitors that display the Garriga information.

RENAULT ENGINEER
C’est magnifique!

A bag of cash is placed in front of Nicky. He shakes hands
with the Engineer.

NICKY
It’s been a pleasure, Monsieur. I
wish you the best of luck.
RENAULT ENGINEER
With friends like you, who needs
luck?

The Renault guys laugh at his joke. Nicky joins in.

INT. DIVE BAR - DAY
A man in a FERRARI JACKET slides a bag of money to Nicky.
FERRARI ENGINEER
With friends like you, who needs
luck?
They both LAUGH at his joke.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. HRT RACING TEAM WORKSHOP - DAY
Nicky LAUGHS with the HRT TEAM OWNER.

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. TEAM INDIA PIT - DAY
Nicky LAUGHS with the HEAD OF TEAM INDIA.

SMASH CUT TO:
111.

INT. MARUSSIA TEAM OFFICES - DAY
Nicky LAUGHS with the HEAD OF TEAM MARUSSIA.

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Nicky stuffs money into a duffel bag in his trunk, zips it
closed and SLAMS THE TRUNK SHUT.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

DING. The elevator doors open and Nicky emerges with TWO
FULL DUFFEL BAGS, headed for his suite.

INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NICKY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Nicky enters his suite and as the door shuts behind him--

NICKY
Hello?

No response. He walks into the living area.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Jess?

He looks at his WATCH: 7:05. He continues on to the
bedroom. No sign of her. He’s concerned. Anxious.

 

INT. NICKY’S SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Nicky is seated on the bed, waiting. Still anxious.

He glances at his watch: 7:30. This time it’s him who’s been
left alone.

Nicky chokes back his emotions and refocuses. He marches to
the front foyer, grabs the bags and opens the door to reveal:

JESS, luggage in hand, ready to go.

JESS
Sorry I’m late.

He’s relieved, but doesn't speak.
112.
JESS (CONT'D)
What...?

A smile.

INT. FARMACIA - NIGHT

CLOSE ON hulking GORDON, McEwen’s bodyguard, squinting,
looking for something, getting frustrated.

REVEAL he’s staring at a shelf of medical supplies. Finally
he finds what he’s looking for. A NIGHT GUARD mouthpiece.

CUT TO:
AT THE REGISTER, the CHECKOUT GIRL tallies up his items:
NIGHT GUARD, NECK BRACE, DUCT TAPE, A MARS BAR, RUBBING
ALCOHOL, GAUZE...

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Gordon enjoys a small meal at the bar, watching futbol on the
TV and drinking a cerveza.

ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
Gooo00000000000000a11111111!

The bar patrons explode with joy, but not Gordon.

GORDON
Fucking twats...

BEEP. His cellphone gets a text. He reads it, then matter
of factly motions for his check.

GORDON (CONT'D)
Cuenta...

And as he shovels down a few more bites--

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

Gordon exits the bar and heads for his SUV. He notices a dent
in his bumper.

GORDON
Ah bloody hell...

He’s pissed, looking for a culprit. Then, a beat later, he
LAUGHS to himself- as if hearing a joke in his head.
113.

He disregards the dent, gets in the vehicle and drives away.

INT. GORDON’S CAR - NIGHT

Gordon drives on a HIGHWAY, tuning in the game on the radio.
BEEP. Another TEXT. He reads it out of the corner of his eye.
He continues to drive a bit, then puts on his blinker and
EXITS AN OFF RAMP.

INT. GORDON’S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Gordon drives down a city street, looking for street signs.
Eventually he makes a turn and digs through the shopping bag
next to him until he pulls out the NIGHT GUARD he purchased.

He tries to open the packaging with great difficulty, finally
tearing it apart with his teeth. He PUTS THE MOUTHPIECE IN.

Still driving, LOUDLY BREATHING through the hole in the
mouthpiece. He reaches back into the bag for the NECK BRACE.

HE PUTS IT ON, turns up the game on the radio and SLAMS HIS
FOOT ON THE PEDAL.

VROOM! Within moments he’s moving at INCREDIBLE SPEED down
the city street.

CAMERA HOLDS ON GORDON as the car gets faster and faster, the
noise of the engine and the game BUILDING IN VOLUME until--

CRASH! The windows SHATTER, the AIRBAG EXPLODES-- absorbing
Gordon’s mass as best it can.

He stunned for a moment but soon shakes it off. He opens the
door and, removing his neckbrace--

EXT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Gordon exits the car, shedding the neckbrace.

He pulls a PISTOL from inside his jacket and spits out the
night guard just as he arrives at the CAR he just hit to find-

JESS AND NICKY, bloodied and disoriented in Nicky’s car.
They're alive enough to see a gun is pointed right at them.

CUT TO BLACK.

A few ominous beats of darkness.
114.

SLOW, REVERBERANT FOOTSTEPS are heard.

FADE IN:

INT. AUTO WORKSHOP - NIGHT

CLOSE ON expensive OXFORDS walking across the cold concrete
of a dimly lit INDUSTRIAL SPACE-- passing tools and equipment
and eventually revealing a disturbing TABLEAU--

Jess and Nicky, BOUND and GAGGED with tape, seated on CHAIRS.

Gordon sits watch nearby, tending to his own small wounds
with the rubbing alcohol and gauze he bought while holding
them at GUNPOINT.

The TWO DUFFELS OF CASH are opened in front of them.
They all look to the newly arrived man who stops before them.

GARRIGA (0.S.)
Remove the tape from his mouth.

REVEAL Garriga looking on them with disdain. Owens is a few
steps behind him, settling in as Gordon removes the tape,
from Nicky. Jess is left gagged. She’s scared.

GARRIGA (CONT’D)
Do you really think I’m such an
amateur that I would not have
someone on the inside with McEwen?
Someone to keep eyes on you?

(then)
Twenty years in this business teach
you never to be too careful. He’s
my secret weapon...

(then)
Now imagine my surprise when Gordon
showed me what you sold to McEwen.
Not some fake software as we
discussed. But my plans, my
designs,

(explodes )
THE REAL EXR! STOLEN FROM MY
SERVERS! STOLEN FROM ME!!!

(then)
What’s more- You sold it to McEwen
for three million dollars. But in
these bags there is 27 million
dollars which means YOU SOLD IT TO
EVERYONE!

His anger ECHOES through the facility.
115.

GARRIGA (CONT'D)
THIS IS MY REPUTATION. THIS IS MY
STANDING. YOU'VE MADE ME LOOK LIKE
AN AMATEUR!

NICKY
You hired a con man.

THWACK! Owens punches Nicky’s insolent mouth.

OWENS
Theiving piece of shite.

Garriga gets a tenuous hold on his rage.

GARRIGA
So- before the inevitable bloody
end, I want to know how. How did
you get the information?

He DARTS TOWARD JESS in a rage.

GARRIGA (CONT'D)
AND WHAT DID SHE HAVE TO DO WITH
IT!?

He GRABS HER by the throat with one hand, PINCHING HER NOSE
with the other.

NICKY
No no--

Nicky is powerless as Jess struggles for air.

GARRIGA
TELL ME!

NICKY
Stop! I'll tell you! She had
nothing to do with it! I/’11 tell
you!

He lets go, turns his glare on Nicky.

NICKY (CONT'D)
She's totally innocent. I have a
guy- he cracked your encryption,
found a backdoor into your servers,
it was easy. You should really fire
your I.T. guy by the way...

This angers Garriga.
116.

GARRIGA
No. You used my login, my password.
How did you get it?

NICKY
It’s easy. Just brute force.
Computer tries all possible
combinations. Infinite monkeys,
infinite typewriters-—

GARRIGA
Bullshit! Liar!

Garriga whips out a key fob SECURITY KEY (A real device for
high end cybersecurity that randomly generates passwords on
its small display).

GARRIGA (CONT’D)
This generates a new password every
15 minutes and it never leaves my
sight. How did you get it?!

NICKY
What’s it matter? It’s done.

GARRIGA
Tell me!

He pinches Jess’ nose again. Gordon cocks his pistol.

NICKY
Leave her alone!

GARRIGA
HOW? !

NICKY
Let go!

GARRIGA
HOW! ?

NICKY

ALL RIGHT FINE IT WAS HER!!!
Garriga backs off. Jess is shocked, she looks to Nicky.
NICKY (CONT'D)
But she didn’t know it. She didn’t
know anything.

Jess tries to speak, shocked. Garriga is intrigued.
117.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Your security is tight- tighter
than I expected.

QUICK FLASH: Nicky in his room, trying to hack into
Garriga’s servers with great difficulty.

NICKY (CONT'D)
I thought I could break the key,
but I couldn’t. I was ready to give
up- but when I saw Jess at the
party-

QUICK FLASH: Nicky and Jess talking at the party.

NICKY (CONT'D)
--once I knew you were together, I
had something to work with.

Jess, still bound, looks on with disbelief. She shakes her
head, trying to speak as Nicky’s eyes go cold.

NICKY (CONT'D)
(cold)
I used her. I’ve been using her.

He looks at Jess’ pained face, he has no sympathy for her.

NICKY (CONT'D)
There’s a science to winning
someone over. For a woman it’s all
about emotion. Connection.

QUICK FLASH: Nicky and Jess at the pool bar.

NICKY (CONT'D)
You have to make them believe you
feel emotion as strongly as they
do... It’s what they’ve been
waiting for all their lives...

QUICK FLASH: At the pool bar, Nicky talks about Miami.

NICKY (V.O.)
Shared history was my in. After
that you open her up.

QUICK FLASH: Farhad greeting Jess.

NICKY
A friendly face sets her off
balance, defuses aggression. You
talk about emotional matters.
118.

QUICK FLASH: Nicky pouring his heart out to Jess.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Body language- arms down, you’re
exposed. They pick up on it. And
once you get them talking, you move
into their personal space- not from
the front, that’s aggression-- but
from the side.

QUICK FLASH of Nicky and Jess talking in the Boca
neighborhood while he slides in next to her.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Sociologists call it the Gauchais
Reaction. They’re disarmed.

(then)
Now they’re open. You know you’re
there once they start to mimic you
unconsciously. A head bob, a hand
movement. It means you’re in sync.
Then you seal the deal. Tell her
she’s changed you. Changed how you
see the world. And then you
close...

FLASHBACK TO THE WATERFRONT as Jess puts the NECKLACE on.

NICKY (CONT'D)
Give her a talisman, a symbol, or
in this case, a gift that says ‘you
were always in my thoughts...’

CUT TO:
ON JESS, tied up, crying as Nicky keeps explaining.

NICKY (CONT'D)
There was a wireless keylogger in
the necklace.

QUICK FLASH: Jess returns to the suite with the necklace box.
and hides it in her drawer.

NICKY (CONT'D)
All she had to do was bring it back
to the room...

QUICK FLASH: Garriga works on his iPad in his room, he
glances at the display on his security key and starts typing
in a password with his WIRELESS KEYBOARD.
119.

NICKY (V.O.)
...It picked up the keystrokes and
I got it all.

QUICK FLASH: Nicky sits at his laptop in his room, RECEIVING
THE DATA on his laptop as JESS SLEEPS IN THE BACKGROUND.

NICKY (V.O.)
Then I logged into your server as
you and downloaded everything I
could find about the EXR...
And as he LOGS INTO GARRIGA’S SERVER--
BACK TO SCENE:

Garriga stares at Nicky, absorbing this. Jess closes her
teary eyes, devastated.

NICKY
It’s not her fault. She had no
idea. She got fooled, but she’s
not to blame. Just let her go.
He looks to teary Jess.

NICKY (CONT'D)
I’m sorry.

She shakes her head.
Garriga thinks. He looks to Owens. A beat, then--
He starts LAUGHING. Nicky is confused. Owens LAUGHS too.

NICKY (CONT'D)
What? What’s so funny?

GARRIGA
I think he’s lost his mind!

Laughing continues. Gordon seems perplexed. He laughs anyway.

NICKY
What?

Unable to talk, Garriga motions for Owens to pull off the
tape from Jess’ mouth.

NICKY (CONT'D)
What?

Owens removes the tape. Jess looks to Nicky.
120.

JESS
Oh my God you really do love me.

Nicky is flummoxed.

JESS (CONT'D)
We’re so screwed.

NICKY
What are you talking about?!

JESS
Garriga’s not my boyfriend. I
hardly even know him.

ON NICKY, absolutely blindsided.

NICKY
What!?

GARRIGA
What the hell were you saying about
me and her? She’s just a race
skank!

JESS
Race skank!? What is that?!

Nicky can’t believe his ears.

GARRIGA
She's been driving me crazy,
hanging around, flirting, teasing--
and the minute I try to get her up
to my room? A headache, a period.

The world’s longest period. She’s
never even been in my room.

NICKY
Jess? What the fuck?
JESS
I was just trying to make you
jealous.
NICKY
You did! I saw you in his room.
JESS
It was a hooker. I sent her up to
his room.
NICKY

That’s not true.
121.

GARRIGA
It’s true, I use prostitutas.

NICKY
(to Jess)
I saw your face!

JESS
You saw what I wanted you to see.
You taught me that, remember.

NICKY
You are a race skank.
JESS
I am not a race skank!
GARRIGA
Not a very good one at least.
NICKY
Then what the hell were you doing
with him?!
JESS

I was trying to steal his watch. I
was on him for a week, waiting for
my chance and then you showed up.

Garriga holds up his wrist, displaying a gorgeous timepiece.

GARRIGA
This watch?

NICKY
(to Jess)
You're still doing watches?

JESS
It’s a Richard Mille! It’s worth
500,000 dollars!

NICKY
You’re so much better than watches!

JESS
I’m good at it- It’s what I like!

NICKY
But he roughed you up!

JESS
He didn’t, he did.
122.

Jess motions to Owens. Nicky glares at him.

OWENS
She was stealing from him.

JESS
He caught me racking up charges on
Garriga’s credit line. He scared
the shit out of me.

GARRIGA
(to Owens)
This is unbelievable...

NICKY
(to Jess)
Just to make me jealous? Were you
ever gonna tell me?

JESS
I tried to!

GARRIGA
Enough.

NICKY
Like a killer whale playing with a
baby seal...

JESS
Oh that’s rich! Like you’re the
great communicator!

GARRIGA
Quiet!

NICKY
What was I supposed to say? “I’m
ripping off your boyfriend please
don’t tell him?”

JESS
Oh that’s a convenient excuse!

NICKY
It makes perfect sense! If it was
a lie, it was a white lie!

GARRIGA
QUIET!

NICKY
I care about you! I was worried
about you!
123.

JESS
You were worried about a duffle bag
full of cash is what you were
worried about!

NICKY
How can you say that? I just tried
to save your life!

JESS
By lying! Like you always do! Black
lies!

NICKY

We're both liars! That’s why we're
together! And if it wasn’t a white
lie then it was a grey one! A light
grey one--

BANG! Owens SHOOTS NICKY IN THE CHEST, flipping him backward
in his chair.

Jess SCREAMS as he lands on the floor, gasping. We’re
instantly back to a harsh reality.

JESS
Nicky!!

Garriga is as shocked as anyone.

GARRIGA
What the fuck are you doing?!

Jess continues to SCREAM.
OWENS
I couldn't take another fucking

word.

STAY ON JESS as she watches Nicky struggle to stay alive,
Garriga and Owens argue in the background.

GARRIGA
Control yourself with that cannon!
It will bring the police!!

Nicky is fading quickly. Jess throws herself off the chair,
landing on her knees, fighting her bonds to get to Nicky.

JESS
Nicky Nicky Nicky- look at me...

He’s writhing and gasping and delirious.
124.

NICKY
Toledo...? Is it Toledo...?

JESS
What? Nicky it’s me.

Nicky is quickly lost in a haze of pain and lack of air.

Owens holds the gun to Jess’ head. She’s too preoccupied with
dying Nicky to care.

OWENS
What about her?

Garriga thinks. He steps up to her.

GARRIGA
Look at me.

She ignores him, staring at dying Nicky.

Garriga grabs her chin, turning her head to him. She glares
at him--

Then SWINGS AT HIM WILDLY with her bound hands. He bats off
her attack easily, quickly gaining control.

She burns with hatred and despair.

GARRIGA (CONT’D)
Lo siento quierda...

He lets go. Headed for the door- motioning for Gordon to
follow him out.

GARRIGA (CONT’D)
(to Owens)
Kill her. Just do it quietly.

Garriga and Gordon EXIT as Jess returns her attention to
Nicky, who is slipping away fast.

JESS
Look at me look at me-- look at me.

Glassy eyed, Nicky barely manages to focus on her voice.
JESS (CONT'D)
I love you. I love you. Look at my
eyes. I believe you. I believe you.
I love you. I trust you.

A long moment and-- he’s gone.
125.

She collapses on him, devastated. And as she cries, the
sound of OWENS rummaging through METAL DRAWERS AND CABINETS
is heard.

She glances over to see OWENS-- collecting a strange
assortment of FRIGHTENING IMPLEMENTS AND DUCT TAPE from the
workshop shelves into a tool tray.

Jess could not care less, the quicker the better. And as he
heads over to her, she steals one more longing look at Nicky.

Something catches her eye beside his head. A metal PEN from
Nicky’s pocket.

An idea as Owens approaches ominously behind her. She
reaches for it with her bound hands. And as he comes to a
stop behind her--

SHE SWINGS AROUND and STABS him in the leg.

OWENS
AHHH! !

He drops the tray, showering Jess with the sharp metal
objects as he falls to his knees in pain.

OWENS (CONT'D)
What the fuck!

He backhands her in a rage-- swatting her away. He pulls out
the pen and grumbles through gritted teeth.

OWENS (CONT'D)
Do you want him to fucking die?!

Jess is flummoxed by his words-- WHICH ARE SUDDENLY SPOKEN IN
AN AMERICAN ACCENT. His Welsh accent is GONE.

OWENS (CONT'D)
Don’t you know anything?

Owens rummages through the tools on the ground-- finding an
OIL INJECTOR (basically a large SYRINGE) and turning his
attention to Nicky’s wound--

OWENS (CONT'D)
What kind of piker are you? You
never heard of a Toledo Panic
Button? Didn’t he tell you I was
inside?

Jess is absolutely speechless. She can only shake her head.
126.

OWENS (CONT'D)
Oh Jesus- you must be terrified.
Must’ve shaved a decade off your
life with panic...

He flips Nicky on his side, rips open his shirt around the
exit wound. He tears off some DUCT TAPE and covers the hole.

OWENS (CONT'D)
You shoot between the third and
fourth rib. About eleven O’clock of
the left nipple. It misses the
heart, all the major arteries.

Just punctures the lung. Works most
of the time. Well, fifty five
percent of the time. Probabilistic.

He flips Nicky on his back and tapes shut the entry wound.
OWENS (CONT'D)
Untreated, you’ve got ten minutes
tops before he drowns in his own
blood.

He STICKS the blunt injector needle through the tape and
DRAWS BACK the PLUNGER. It fills with BLOOD.

OWENS (CONT'D)
But patch it up and account for the
cavity pressure...

He PULLS THE PLUNGER OUT completely and--

SPLRT-WHOOOOSH. The blood clears as air rushes out of
Nicky’s chest cavity.

OWENS (CONT'D)
+..you got about two hours to get
to a hospital.

GASP. With a thunderous rush, Nicky DRAWS A MAMMOTH BREATH-
filling his lungs with blessed air.

Jess fills with hope.

JESS
Nicky!

Owens beams.

OWENS
There’s my boy.... there we go.
127.

Owens replaces the plunger in the syringe, equalizing the
pressure. As Nicky takes a few more breaths, Owens quickly
cuts Jess loose.

OWENS (CONT'D)
Keep an eye on that. Pull the
plunger if he can’t breathe.

She scrambles to Nicky, scooping him into her arms. He’s by
no means in good shape, but he’s alive.

JESS
You're alive... you’re alive...

Nicky manages his first pained words.

NICKY
Fuck you Dad!

Jess can’t believe her ears.

JESS
What?
OWENS
(to Nicky)
Language boy- I just saved your
life!
NICKY
You couldn’t have shot them
instead?
OWENS

And have the whole world rain down
on my head? This was your mess!
You pay for it. Three years I was
on the inside! For what? So you
could blow it to make cow eyes with
some race skank?

NICKY JESS
She is NOT a race skank!! I am NOT a race skank!!

OWENS (CONT'D)
I brought you in. You said you
could handle it. I should have
known with all your talk of regret
and ennui that you were gimped.
Live and learn I say.

He extends a hand to Jess with a big smile.
128.

OWENS (CONT'D)
I’m Bucky by the way.

She shakes.

JESS
Pleasure.

OWENS
I like you. You can take a punch.

JESS
Thanks.

A moment of calm. Owens looks at the nearby duffels.

OWENS
Well there it is, the ill gotten
gain...
(then)
We gotta get him to the hospital
before that other lung fills up
with blood.

CUT TO:

INT. MERCEDES SEDAN - DAWN
Owens drives as Jess tends to Nicky in the back seat.

OWENS

I’ve been working for this prick
Spaniard for three years. He’s got
a guy at McEwen and he doesn’t tell
me? What the hell happened to
trust?

(self-scolding)
Should have seen it. Sloppy. You
can be many things in this game but
sloppy ain’t one of them. Time to
get out.

JESS
It was a hell of con though. Sorry
we messed it up.

OWENS
Beaut wasn’t it?
(then)
You know what the hard part was?
The hard part wasn’t getting him to
hire a con man.
(MORE )
129.

OWENS (CONT'D)

No, no- the hard part was getting
him to think it was his idea to
hire a con man. Ah, fuck it-- the
hard part was not laughing. Too
rich.

(then)
You can’t con an honest man. Ever
heard that? They gotta have
larceny in their heart. Isn’t that
right Nicholas?

Nicky, bleary, nods.

OWENS (CONT'D)
Larceny in their heart. This guy’s
heart was black with the stuff. Low
hanging fruit.

He pulls over, parking across the street from a HOSPITAL. He
glances in the mirror at Jess and Nicky, happy together.

OWENS (CONT'D)
This life is no place for
lovebirds. There’s no happiness
here with that. Just think about
this honey-- you tricked my boy.
That’s no small feat. But the con
you pulled wasn’t for money. It was
for love. Now you got me choked up.
But this game is about the money
and if you’re not into that you
need to move to the land of the
regular people. Where trust isn’t a
tool to get you rich or get you
laid... it’s where trust is
everything.

(beat)

It’s all you got and all you’1ll
ever have. And like it or not,
that’s who you are now. Both of
you.

Another glance in rear view. They seem okay with his
assessment. It softens him a touch.

OWENS (CONT'D)
But look at you two. In love. It’s
a beautiful thing.
(he turns to them)
But I’m taking the money. All of
it.

Nicky doesn’t seem surprised as Owens gets out of the car and
pops the trunk.
130.
NICKY
That’s Dad...

JESS
Well that explains you...

Nicky smiles.

KNOCK KNOCK. Owens raps on the window. Jess rolls it down
to reveal his curmudegeonly face.

OWENS
I‘1l see you at Christmas.

He walks off with the two duffle bags of cash and disappears
into the gloam.
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN

MUSIC as Jess shoulders Nicky’s weight as they walk across
the street.

As they shuffle along, they seem strangely happy. Well
suited, content.

They head to the hospital. They head for the future. In love.
A GLINT catches Nicky’s eye. He looks to Jess’ wrist:
It's Garriga’s watch.

FADE OUT.

THE END
