INT. JEWELLER'S OFFICES AND STRONG ROOM. | DAY.

 

Something violent is happening in a Hatton Garden establishment.

Employees are rising in alarm. They disappear from view when the
reinforced glass of the office is splintered by a blast froma
sawn-off shot-gun. The gun swings round and shatters the lock of

the office door.

Three balaclaved figures burst through the door, pushing a
terrified customer before them. The first (OTTO) draws on a gun
and fires two shots at T.V. Cameras covering the room. A monitor
on a desk in foreground goes blank. OTTO sweeps it from the desk.
During these brief seconds the other two villains, GEORGE and KEN,
have forced the terrified employees to lie on the floor, hands on
their heads. OTTO moves swiftly to the steel grid of the strong
room, producing a small cross-bow as he goes. KEN runs back to
the entrance past him. os

The startled MANAGER comes out of the office and encounters
GEORGE's shot gun.

He blasts off a round from his gun.

GEORGE goes through the glass door of the Manager's office just as
OTTO vandalizes it. He is showered in splinters. KEN has climbed
onto the window sill. He disappears from sight.

one or two disguises. They jump into the car, which accelerates
away from the kerb. But it brakes sharply. They are all thrown
forward and GEORGE stares through the windscreen, startled.

MRS COADY has frozen a few yards into the road, beyond the next
car, and ds staring at him. WANDA swings the wheel and.

WANDA
Oh yes, speak it, speak it!

OTTO

WANDA

No! No, not here ...

OTTO
Yes! Now! (Singing) Nessuno dorme...

WANDA
No, no. No!! lLet’s go to your place. Quick ...

She tears herself away, recovers her shirt, and starts to put
it on when she freezes. So does OTTO. They can hear KEN
opening the flat door.

KEN (OOV)
Wanda?

They stay frozen. KEN is at the main door, listening. Satisfied,
he crosses to the tank and holds up the fishfood carton.

KEN
(Whispering) Look what I’ve got, Wanda. Treasure!

He shows the key to Wanda the fish. As he does so, WANDA the
girl peeps through the bedroom door which has been left
slightly ajar. Seeing KEN preoccupied, she opens it a crack
more and watches KEN put the key into a miniature treasure
chest on the floor of the aquarium. She checks on OTTO,

He‘s safely in the bathroom doing his hair. KEN withdraws
his arm from the water and dries it on the cloth always kept
by the tank for this purpose.

KEN
(To fish) Sssshh.
  

  

As KEN starts to feed the fish, WANDA wanders out of the bedr
casually towelling her hair. KEN jumps. WANDA starts. :

WANDA
Hm? My brother's using the bathroom.
KEN's eyes flash with suspicion and dislike.

KEN

WANDA
Yeah, we've just been to see George and...

But KEN is in the bedroom in a flash. OTTO stands by the
mirror in the bathroom. :

OTTO notes KEN's eyeline and takes his arm.

WANDA
(Controlling her tears) Yeah. I'm fine now.

 

REN does a take on WANDA's apparent mood change.

OTTO

And they accept their mistake so they’re offering
you this... (producing a stunning pendant) ...
which is worth over three times as much and...

WENDY
(Putting a hand on the locket which she’s
wearing) This is the nicest thing you’ve ever
given me that I absolutely love, and now you want
me to give it back.

ARCHTE
I don’t want you to give...
WENDY
Well they can’t have it.
ARCHIE

She runs into the garden. ARCHIE fumes impatently.

WANDA comes along the street, looking at the numbers of the
houses. She pauses and checks the number on Archie’s letter.

INT FRIEND’S FLAT DAY 85.

ARCHIE is preening the flat. He checks the champagne, turns
the music up, looks round, checks his appearance.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FRIEND'S FLAT. DAY. 86.
WANDA is outside the door of the flat. She opens her bag and

prepares to go into combat. A squirt of scent up her skirt, a
smudging of the eye make-up, a deep breath. She rings.

INT. _FRIEND‘S FLAT. DAY. 87.
ARCHIE opens the door. WANDA enters.

WANDA
Hi... hey. It’s nice.

spoke this morning. :

She admires a thick white rug by the fireplace. ARCHIE turns the

music up.

He polkas

ARCHIE
May I have the pleasure?

with her, rather well and flamboyantly, for a few
WANDA is surprised.

ARCHIE
You make me feel so free!

WANDA
eee Free?

ARCHIE
Wanda, have you any idea what it's like being English?
Being so correct all the time, so stifled by this dread
of saying the wrong thing, of asking someone whether
they're married and hearing "My wife left me this
morning", of saying "Do you have children?" and being
told "They all burned to death on Wednesday", or getting
somebody's name wrong or having our flies open at a
State Funeral. Wanda, we're terrified of embarrassment.
That's why we're 50 ... dead. Most of my friends are
dead you know. We have these piles of corpses to
dinner. But you're alive, God bless you. And I want to
be. I'm so bored with all this... I want to make love
with you Wanda. I'm a good lover. At least I used to
be, back in the early fourteenth century. Can we go to
bed?

WANDA
I thought you'd never ask.

-73- REVISED 6.7.87

ARCHIE suddenly sweeps her up in his arms, carries her into the
bedroom and lays her on the bed: OTTO is watching through the
louvered doors of the wardrobe.

ARCHIE
I think I love you Wanda.

WANDA
Oh you sweet man. Can I ask you something?

ARCHIE
Anything. Anything...

WANDA
Where's the locket?

ARCHIE
I couldn't get it, Wanda...

They are speaking so quietly that OTTO has to strain to hear.

WANDA
what?!

ARCHIE
Wendy won't give it back. Look, (producing the new
pendant) I got you this...

WANDA

have to have mine.

ARCHIE

OTTO missed this. He's frustrated.

ARCHIE
OK, OK. All right. I'11 get it for you.

The wardrobe door is opening slightly in the background.

ARCHIE

WANDA
It affects us Archie.

ARCHIE

WANDA

And especially if he says something about my jewels.
The wardrobe door is open wide. OTTO is moving closer to the bed.

ARCHIE
What?

WANDA
He has some jewels of mine and he won't tell me where
he's put them. You might be able to find out...

ARCHIE
Wanda, I can't...

WANDA
Archie! Please! Promise me. Sex is difficult for
me ... 4f I don't completely trust someone.

ARCHIE

WANDA

noise. ARCHIE hears it. His head comes up.

WANDA
You can say that again.
ARCHIE

WANDA

Oh he's so dumb. He once told me the Gettysberg address
was where Lincoln lived.

ARCHIE
Oh. And those terrible lies he told about the CIA! Oh
dear... painful... :

ARCHIE snorts with laughter. OTTO is silently imploding.
WANDA

And when he heard your daughter was named Portia , he
said "Why did they name her after a car?". :

OTTO, bemused for a moment, struggles for calm. ARCHIE laughs and
laughs. And laughs. WANDA watches ARCHIE with curiosity.

WANDA
(Not lying) ... I like the way you laugh, Archie.

There is a moment between them.
ARCHIE
And I like you.. You're funny. How can someone as ...
bright as you, have a brother who's so...
OTTO's head appears over the side of the bed, about two feet
from them. There is another moment between ARCHIE and WANDA.

OTTO
(Reasonably) Don't call me stupid.

They both see OTTO is there and cry out, and leap away from him
across the bed. /

WANDA
What are you doing here?! Get out of here!!

In a flash, OTTO has entangled ARCHIE in the bedspread, grabbed
WANDA by the wrist and is pulling her out of the bedroom,

WANDA.

OTTO shoves her out of the door of the flat into the corridor.

The camera is turning through 180 degrees and now pulls back
rapidly, to reveal ARCHIE dangling upside down out of the
window of the flat. OTTO is holding him by his ankles.

The road is deserted. A beaten-up “i Fora wa

MRS COADY appears with her two remaining ‘dogs fron the a
entrance to her block and turns away from the Ford.. The ‘Ford -
moves slowly off after her, and the reggae music is switched
off.

MRS COADY walks a few paces and then prepares to cross the
road. One of her dogs starts pulling her across the road.
The Ford accelerates. But the second dog tangles its leash
round a lamp post and hauls MRS COADY back onto the pavement.

Close on KEN as rasta, horrified. He swings the wheel to
avoid the dog in the road. He fails. It is flattened.

KEN
Aaah... oh £f£fffff... .
The Ford, swerving, hits a council rubbish bin and crashes to
a halt. MRS COADY, realising what's happened, runs towards ©

And sure enough you came along and fucked it up, Otto. *

I was dealing with something delicate there, Otto.
Delicate as in "Don't give it to a brain-damaged
gorilla." I was setting up a guy who's incredibly
important to us, who'll tell me if they're going to
arrest you, and where the loot is... and you come loping
in, like Rambo without a jockstrap and you dangle him
out of a fifth floor window. - Was that smart Otto?

Was that shrewd? Was it good tactics? Or was it
stupid!

Don't call me stupid.

WANDA
You're right. I'm sorry. To call you stupid would be
an insult to stupid people. I've known dresses with a .

ape?

OTTO
Apes don't read philosophy.

WANDA
Yes they do, Otto. They just don't understand it. Let
me tell you a couple of things, Otto. Aristotle was not
Belgian. The central message of Buddhism is not "Every
Man For Himself".

EXT. ROAD NEAR ARCHIE'S HOUSE. DAY. oo. 101.

OTTO approaches the house, muttering. He notes the absence of
cars from the drive, and looks at his watch. He pulls his gun out
and starts looking for cats, when he hears a distant breaking of
glass. He is curious.

OTTO comes through the back door, sees a movement - no more - at
the end of the corridor, creeps into the hall and glimpses ARCHIE
kneeling at a chest of drawers in the living room, rummaging.
ARCHIE rises. OTTO disappears. ARCHIE goes out into the hall,
and almost immediately comes spinning back in, with a raincoat
over his head and his arms pinned to his sides, followed by OTTo.
ARCHIE falls over a small table, and OTTO, in a trice, ties his
hands behind his back.

discovers his hands are tied. Then he hears WENDY coming
through the front door and reacts with horror. But WENDY
goes upstairs. ARCHIE sees the bag. He stares. From
upstairs comes a scream. And another. ARCHIE picks the bag
up with his teeth and scatters the contents. WENDY is
running down the stairs. ARCHIE sees the locket and somehow
gets it and the chain in his mouth and slumps, feigning
unconsciousness, just as WENDY bursts in. She sees him and
screams and runs to him. ARCHIE feigns waking up, making moaning
noises. WENDY kneels by him.

WENDY

ARCHIE bursts in, breathless. He looks at a clock, which

shows 5.03 p.m. He hurries to the kitchen. The appearance of the
flat has altered a little, but due to ARCHIE's haste, and the lack
of lingering shots, only the sharpest members of the cinema
audience notice anything. ARCHIE shoves the champagne into the
freezing compartment of the fridge, and puts some music on. As
the music swells, he checks his appearance.

He gives her another kiss. Half-way through, WANDA stiffens.

mouth. She takes it out, looks at it, looks at ARCHIE and
smiles.

leans against the wall and struggles to remain conscious, as a
drop of saliva creeps downwards from the corner of her mouth.

ARCHIE cavorts round the room, maintaining the flow of luscious
Russkie chat. WANDA, hardly undressed at all, appears at the
door, and watches. ARCHIE sees her and stops.

That's Wendy's. She's the rich one. Why?

WANDA
«+. Never mind.

She disappears. ARCHIE starts up the Russian again, removes his
underpants, flicks them up with his foot and tosses them away, and
Cavorts. The door of the flat opens and in walk the JOHNSTONE
FAMILY. A couple in their forties, three children, 13, 11 and 6,
and a nanny and a small child. They are all through the door
before they see ARCHIE and WANDA. They now all stare at each other
for a very long time. The parents are so astonished they do little
to restrain their children's natural curiosity. Eventually the
small child starts to cry.

MR JOHNSTONE
What the hell are you doing??

ARCHIE conceals his private parts with a photograph of Mrs
Johnstone, smiling.

There is a movement below. KEN peers. MRS COADY is emerging
slowly. KEN's eye goes to the telescopic sighted rifle in
position.

We see the telescope's POV. The cross wires are focussed on some
apparatus on the scaffolding.

MRS COALY moves out of the door towaras the pavement leading her
remaining dog. We see now above her a large block of stone
hanging from the scaffolding right above her.

 

KEN watches her for a moment, and then returns to the sight.

His non-telescope eye flickers between the stone ball to MRS
COADY. She moves to the edge of the step. KEN fires. The bullet
hits a pulley. A pause. The rope through the pulley suddenly
starts to feed through and the block descends. MRS COADY checks
for rain, as she always does. Hearing a thunderous roaring sound,
she steps back on to the steps, pulling the dog back with her, to
put her brolly up.

The stone block plummets on to the dog behind her. KEN screams.
MRS COADY gets the umbrella up and walks off. The leash tightens.
She returns for her dog. -But the leash terminates in a concrete
block, from which a stain emerges. She continues to look around

for her dog.
KEN screams again. And topples off the stool.

MRS COADY begins to realise what's happened. She shrieks. KEN
shrieks. She clasps her hand to her heart. KEN rolls around
making agonized noises. MRS COADY totters and falls to the
pavement, twitches and is still.

at the central table; and by a COURT USHER who has been
standing by the jury.

But GEORGE breaks free, gets to the witness box and grabs
WANDA who screams. ARCHIE grabs GEORGE from behind,

wrestling him away from WANDA. GEORGE hits ARCHIE who reels
back and lands. He lies quietly in the well of the court,
thinking about things. The activities around him take on a
dream-like quality. People pile on top of GEORGE. WANDA plays
shocked and innocent. The JUDGE restores order.

The JUDGE leaves by his private door behind his chair. The
melee continues.

She hurries across the road and tries to hail a cab. The cab

from the Old Bailey.

knocking the driver's hat off. The driver runs for his life.

ARCHIE checks his pockets. Nothing. He sees a ballpoint pen on
the desk and runs to get it. :

ARCHIE
Here! Write it!

KEN takes it, ARCHIE finds a magazine. KEN starts writing but the
pen won't work. ARCHIE shakes it. KEN grabs it back. ARCHIE
runs back to the desk but KEN has found a pencil. He starts to
write, very unsteadidly. ARCHIE waits. KEN pauses. ARCHIE grabs
the magazine and reads what KEN has written on it.

ARCHIE slams it back down. KEN resumes writing. ‘The lead breaks.
A moment of disbelief. KEN tries to continue writing but it
won't. ARCHIE runs around, sees a pentel with its cap off, but of
course it's dry. KEN is trying to find a knife to sharpen the
pencil, but all the kitchen ones are useless. ARCHIE joins KEN in
the kitchen, upends a drawer byt can't find a suitable knife.
Then he sees wanda's typewriter in the bedroom and runs to it. Be
hits a key. Nothing. He stares and starts trying to switch it
on. Nothing causes it to work. Ue checks the plug... It's out of
the socket. He puts it in, switches it on, opens the drawer. No
paper. He's frantic. He sees a Kleenex box and tries to feed a
Kleenex in. It gets mangled. KEN runs up with a ‘toothpaste tube
and tries to write with the paste on the dressing table surface
but the paste won't obey his wishes. ARCHIE suddenly sees a
penknife on the window ledge.

ARCHIE
Look! Knife...

He grabs it and opens it.

ARCHIE
Where's the pencil?

They look around. They have lost it. They run around
incredulously. They can't find the pencil anywhere. Suddenly KEN
holds it up. Triumph. But they've lost the knife. .

ARCHIE
I gave it to you.

KEN
Nnnnn...

ARCHIE runs out of the kitchen, KEN hot on his heels. He's found
an electric carving knife. He tries to sharpen the pencil with
it. Blood spurts everywhere. KEN runs off into bathroom for
repairs. ARCHIE sees a ketchup bottle, grabs it and starts
emptying it over the table.

ARCHIE
Ken! Here! Write in this...

But the ketchup won't flow. KEN appears, holding a newspaper as
tourniquet. ARCHIE grabsthe paper and runs to the typewriter
with it, tears off a sheet, and puts it in. It goes dead. He is
about to throw it out of the window, when KEN grabs him and drags
him across the room and points to the wall. He's written
‘Cathcart Towers' there in blood. ARCHIE stares.
