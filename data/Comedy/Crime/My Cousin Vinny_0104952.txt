EXT. ALABAMA BACK ROAD —- DAY

It’s a sunny, winter day on a paved country in south/western
Alabama. In the distance, peaking over a loping hill we see a
faded metallic green, 1964 Buick Skylark with a white
convertible top and New York plates, As it approaches, we see
two young men in the car, both with dark hair and sunglasses.
They look cool.

CLOSE SHOT ~ RADIO

A hand turns the dial in search of something contemporary -~
finding nothing but country music...

RADIO
(singing)
If you can’t live without me, then
why aren’t you dead...?

»»sand loca) ads with southern accents, farm reports,
evangelists, gospel singers, and a woman with marital problems
seeks guidance from a radio preacher.

ON THE ROAD

The two-lane paved country road passes through huge fields of
cotton plants - little shrubs with little, fluffy tufts of
white. On the side of the road, every 100 yards or so, we see
6’ X 8 X 20’ trussed-up, squared-off bales of cotton covered
with plastic tarps - waiting to be picked up and trucked off.

Up ahead they approach a long bed truck filled with logs on the
way to a sawmill -- this is also lumber country. They overtake
the truck.

They also pass a lot of things you see in the deep south that
you don’t see up north -- little, ramshackle fruit stands with
weather-beaten signs saying "We accept food stamps," crude
hand-lettered signs offering Vidalia onions, pecans, propane,
bulls for sale, a cattle crossing sign -=- a black silhouette of
a cow on a round yellow background with a black border, grain
silos -- big and small.

INT. CAR BACK SEAT

A Rolling Stone magazine, a People magazine, and a variety of
textbooks: The Rhetoric of No, Introduction to Physics,
Introduction to Political Science, and a WELCOME TO UCLA
pamphlet -~ these are college kids. Also in the back seat is a
old (broken) "ghetto blaster" with a tape coming out of it, som
empty soda cans, junk food wrappers, empty Sterno cans, an empt:
cooler, a map to the south (and a line drawn for the route),

a variety of socks, sweaters, etc. etc.

FRONT SEAT

Driving the car is BILL GAMBINO, 21, Italian-American descent,
from New York, optimistic and carefree. The passenger is STAN
ROTHSTEIN, also 21, Jewish, pessimistic, analytical and precise.
They’re bright, college kids in need of a shower and a shave,
but they could be confused for derelicts.

EXT. OFF THE ROAD ~ WOODS - STAN AND BILL ~ NIGHT

*camped out." Bill’s heating up a can of “beans and franks"
over a can of Sterno.

LATER THAT NIGHT

Tucked into sleeping bags. WE HEAR BUGS IN THE AIR. Stan slaps
at the bugs. Bill is fast asleep. TITLES END.

EXT. SAC-O-SUDS CONVENIENCE STORE ~ MORNING

Like a 7-11. Stan and Bill drive up, park and enter.

INT. SAC-O-SUDS - CAMERA PANS OVER BEANS

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Bill and Stan in the canned
vegetable section, looking over the beans. They’re holding cans
of beans, Sterno, tortillas -~ anything cheap, all cradled in
one arm, using their free hands to pick things off the shelves,

STAN
(points)
Here’s some for 3? cents.

BILL
{looking harder)
Here’s some for 32.

STAN
{victorious)
31.

They look more.

BILL
I think that’s it.

STAN
(still looking,
disappointed)
Don’t they have generics?

CONTINUED:

STAN
I think this is their generic.

BILL
(points, 31 cent can)
I’ve never heard of this brand...
(points, 32 cent can)
+..maybe we should get this
one...maybe it’s worth the penny.

STAN
(grabs 31 cent can)
Nah...you’re paying for
advertising.

They walk down the aisle, balancing the precarious ‘load of cans.

BILL
(sees something that
catches his eye)
Tuna. Should we get tuna?

STAN
(complaining)
Oh God, please -- no more tuna.
BILL
It’s got protein. We need
protein,
STAN

(moving on)
Beans have protein,

BILL
Beans make you fart.

STAN
We got a convertible.

BILL
I’m gettin’ it for nyself.

He reaches for it, almost dropping what he has ~ and there’s
little room for more. So he puts the can in his jacket pocket.

MICROWAVE - Stan is heating up a burrito.

The COUNTERMAN/CASHIER is a wiry, unfriendly guy. He serves
Bill a slush drink -- about two thirds full, then adds up the
grocery tab.

BILL
Can you fill this up?

The Cashier looks at the drink, he sighs, then fills it back up
and gives it back to Bill without comment, The Cashier then
puts the groceries into a brown paper bag as Stan and Bill dig
in their pockets.

EXT. SAC-O-SUDS .

Stan and Bill exit, get in their car and leave. Bill drives.
Nearby are row houses - small, box-like houses with severely
peeling paint on dusty-gray, old bare wood, meager~looking
porches, windows covered with rusted screens and sagging, rusty
metal roofs. :

INT. BUICK ~ BILL AND STAN - 20 MINUTES LATER
Driving along. Bill remembers about the tuna in his pocket. He

reaches into his POCKET...and pulls out the can of tuna. He
motions for Stan to look.

BILL
Look. I...forgot to pay for it.
STAN
(thinks)
You could’ve gotten caught.
(beat)

What if someone saw?
Bill shakes his head at the thought. It was a dumb thing.
STAN
The laws are medieval down here.
You know what the minimum age for
execution is in Alabama?

BILL
16?

STAN
TEN.

Bill can’t believe it. He glances in the mirror.

wolf-whistle.

STAN AND BILL’S CELL

A tiny room with a toilet, a chair, a sink and a DOUBLE bunk
bed, Bill and Stan enter - the door is shut behind them. Bill
sits. Stan paces - terrified. He sees a folded cot against
the wall.

A cannon, or a statue of Rober: E. Lee.

The streets around the courthouse have all the little stores
that service the small community of 2000; Western Auto, EZ
Finance company, a single floor, 3000 square foot department
store, a "package" store (liquor store}. Many of the signs are
done in hand lettering.

Some of the stores are so run down it’s hard to tell if they’ve
been abandoned or not. There are a few people walking past.
The setting is quiet, benign, serene. Wa HEAR BIRDS CHIRPING.
It is small town in every way.

THEN, WE HEAR IN THE DISTANCE THE BASS FROM A HIGH-POWERED CAR
STEREO (THUMPA THUMPA THUMPA). An obese woman in a floral-print
dress stops and turns toward the sound. It is unusual indeed.
She watches unapprovingly as she sees...

.-.a perfectly-restored, but muddied-around~the-wheels 1961
Cadillac Coupe de Ville convertible. As the car approaches,

we can identify the music - hip-hop - it’s Tone Loc’s Funky Cold
Medina. The car parks in front of the courthouse and stops.
Silence. The driver’s door opens and out steps VINCENT LA
GUARDIA GAMBONE, a tough New York Italian-American. He’s been
up driving for twenty hours straight and he looks it ~ unshaven,
wrinkled clothes and bloodshot eyes. He looks unquestionably
tough - you’d want him on your side in a gang fight. He’s
wearing Ray-Bans, and a weathered black leather blazer. He
carries a deck of cards in his shirt pocket.

Getting down on his knees, he checks out the front end of the
ear for something is wrong.

The passenger door opens and LISA, Vinny’s girlfriend, gets out
and stretches. Lisa’s pretty, with perfectly-coiffed, jet-black
hair. She’s more appropriately dressed for a New York club than
the deep south, which in these parts, looks downright trampy.
She’s got a small, instant~everything camera - and she takes
pictures of anything that looks interesting.

VINNY
(thick Brooklyn accent)
Boy, do you stick out.

LISA
(same accent)
Me? What about you?

VINNY

She walks ‘round the car into view - wearing very short black

Oh yeah, you’re gonna ‘blend’
perfectly.

Getting up, indicating car’s front suspension.

VINNY
Nothing out of whack as far I see.

LISA
It feels like the wheels went out
of balance right after we hit that
mud.

A black man with a gold STAR imbedded into his tooth is walking
past. He stops and watches as Vinny looks over the wheels.

VINNY
Nah, I don’t think that’s it,

LISA
I think you should put it ona
rack an@ take a look.

He couldn’t wait to meet you.

VINNY

Oh yeah?
BILL

He has lots of questions to ask
you. Go on, Stan.

STAN .
Well, I don’t know where to “s
start....have you had any murder
cases before?

VINNY
No..this would be ny first.

STAN
Your first? What have your other
cases been? Assault and battery?
Armed robbery?

VINNY
No, none of those.

BILL
I expect he’s done burglary, grand
theft auto, drugs...?

VINNY
Nope. Nothing like that.

BILL
(confused)
Vinny, you are a criminal
attorney, aren’t you?

VINNY
Actually, this will be my first
foray into the criminal arena.

STAN
(crushed)
First time?

at Vinny)

STAN
It does get worse.

You haven't been to court yet,

practicing?

VINNY
Six...weeks...

STAN looks at Bill, with a hopeless ‘what is this?’ expression.

BILL
But...you graduated from law
school six years ago, what’ve you
been doing since?

VINNY
Studying for the bar.

Six years? That’s a lotta

INT. COURTROOM ~ DAY
Vinny walks through the empty courtroom,

INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - JUDGE AND VINNY ~ LATE AFTERNOON

The most noticeable thing about the judge's chambers is the vast
expanse of books lining the walls. Vinny‘s seated in front of
SUDGE CHAMBERLAIN HALLER. Vinny is wearing a shirt and pants,
no jacket or tie.

JUDGE
A little informal aren't we? Not
wearing a coat or tie.

VINNY
oh. Sorry.

JUDGE
Well, approving an attorney from
out of state is a pretty informal
matter. I just have a few
questions.

VINNY
Fire away, Judge.

JUDGE
Where did you go to law school?

VINNY
Brooklyn Academy of Law.

Vinny looks up and sees the judge’s law diploma - from Yale
~summa cum laude.

JUDGE
The Brooklyn Academy of Law? Is
that an accredited law school?

The judge’s subtly elitist response makes Vinny instantly feel
he has somehow flunked the first question.

VINNY
(lies)
Oh...yes.

JUDGE
How long have you been practicing?

VINNY
(succumbs to lying big)
I’d say about...oh...gix...almost
six...sixteen years,

JUDGE
Any murder cases?

VINNY
Oh, quite a few, yes.

JUDGE
And what was the outcome?

VINNY
Well, you know: win some, lose
some.

JUDGE
This is not the forum to be
cavalier.

VINNY
of course not, lemme see, most
recently I had an ax murder -which
I won on grounds of temporary
insanity - would you like to hear
the facts of the case?

JUDGE
No.. What else?

VINNY
I had a cop killer...
(shakes head)
«++ lost that one.

JUDGE
Good.

VINNY
You’ve heard of Son of Sam?

JUDGE
The fellah who received orders
to kill from a dawg?

VINNY
Yes, that’s right.

JUDGE
You defended him?

arrested ~ who was found innocent.
Then they caught the real guy.

Vinny's trying to impress the judge has a deleterious effect
“the judge has a fear of appearing backwards.

JUDGE

Well...we don’t have any ‘serial
Killers’ in Beechum County, but
what we do have is every bit as
sophisticated a system of justice
as they do in the rest of the
country.

(beat)
You being from New York and all,
might have the impression that
law is practiced with a degree
of informality down here. It
isn't.

(explaining)
I tell you this because I want
you to know when it comes to
procedure, I’m not a patient man.
I advise you sir, when you cone
into my courtroom, you are to know
the letter of the law ~ I will
react harshly when I find you
don’t. Don’t think being from
New York that you’re gonna get
special treatment. You won’t.
You will be given no leeway
whatsoever.

He takes an official-looking, 700 page book titled Alabama Rules
ef Criminal Procedure off a shelf, and puts it on the desk in
front of Vinny.

JUDGE
I expect you to know this
information when you enter ny

Stan’s upset and Bill’s optimistic.

STAN
++.the ‘The Brooklyn Academy of
Law’ is a correspondence school!
It’s not even an accredited
school!

BILL
So? He passed, didn’t he?

STAN
Eventually. Bill - he’s not a
eriminal attorney - he’s not even
a trial attorney. He‘s a personal
injury attorney. We can’t go into
a murder trial represented by a
personal injury attorney.

BILL
He’s never lost a case ...

STAN
It’s impossible to losa a case
because it costs more to the
insurance company to fight than
to settle. That’s not like
winning, that’s more like legal
extortion.

BILL
So, what do you want to do?

STAN
I don’t know...
(thinks hard)
What are our options? -

They think ~ for the moment they have no options.

A beautiful red sunset contrasts with an ugly weather-beaten
sign in handdrawn paint that simply says HOTEL. Next door, but
sharing the same building of the hotel, is a greasy spoon with
one of those beat-up, simple, no-frills standard issue Coca Cola
signs common throughout the south -the kind with white below

he’s holding the book on court procedure. He sits on the bed.

LISA
This is going to be great.
‘vinny’s first case.’ So, what
can I do? What can I do to help?

Vinny shakes hie head ~ can’t think of anything, and starts
reading. Lisa’s frustrated.

LISA
Nothing? ‘

VINNY :
No. .

vinny keeps reading. Lisa looks around, wondering what to do,
She feels anxious. Vinny picks up on it. He pulis out the pack
of cards from his shirt pocket and gives it to Lisa. She looks
at him, she doesn’t get it. -

LISA
What?

VINNY
Somethin’ to do; play solitaire.

Not exactly what she had in mind. Vinny turns back to the book.
It’s difficult fer him to read. She takes a picture of hin.

sound...the hotel windows vibrate slightly.

industrial-looking building.

CLOSE SHOT ~ STEAM WHISTLE ~ It’s an old brass whistle,
about two feet tall and a half a foot thick, an enormous blast
of steam bursts from its mouth, sending a gray plume into the
air.

THE BLAST STOPS. Vinny closes the window.

The place is empty. Vinny and Lisa come in and sit down.
SUNIUS, a heavy-set, graying black man in a-too~small,
‘stay~prest’ shirt is at the griddle behind the counter.

VINNY

What’s the story with that
ineredibly loud whistle at 5:30

greasy-looking grain on the plate.

VINNY

Lisa takes out her camera, poised to document Vinny’s first
taste of grits. Vinny stares at grits, looks at Junius.

VINNY
So, what is a grit, anyways?

Se JUNIUS
It comes from corn. Hominy
grits.
VINNY
Hominy.
(this means nothing to
him)

How do you cook a grit?

JUNIUS
Simmer it in salted water for
about 15 to 20 minutes. Then you
put it on a plate. With a little
butter.

Vinny tries a small portion of it. Lisa snaps a picture. Vinny
shows no expression of like or dislike. He swallows. He
thinks.

VINNY
Well...I’ve tried grits.

It’s lined with old, dark wood, has water stains here and
peeling paint there - this is a poor county and repairs are a
long time coming. There’s also an Alabama and United States
flag. Vinny and Lisa come in, approach the gate and stop.
Vinny’s wearing his black leather blazer.

He looks to the bailiff, who waves him in, points to the table
on the right. Vinny goes and sits.

two ways to answer it: Guilty
or Not Guilty.

VINNY

Your Honor, my clients didn’t do
anything, they’re innocent, and...

JUDGE

Once again the communication
process has broken down. It
appears to me that you want to
skip the arraignment process, go
directly to trial, skip that and
get a dismissal. I‘m not about
to revamp the entire judicial
process because you find yourself
in the unique position of
defending clients who say they
‘didn’t do it’. The only thing
being tried today is my patience.

(slowly,

condescendingly)
Now, the next words out of your
mouth will either be ‘guilty’,
er ‘not guilty’. If I hear
anything other than ‘guilty’ or
‘not guilty’, you’1l be in
contempt. I don’t want to hear
commentary, argument or opinion,
I don’t even want to hear you
clear your throat - because if
you do, you will be in contempt.

playing solitaire. WE HEAR A DRIP COMING FROM THE BATHROOM. It
annoys Vinny.

VINNY

Is that a drip I hear?
LISA

Yeah?
VINNY

Well, weren’t you the last one
to use the bathroom?

LISA
So?
VINNY
Did you use the faucet?
LISA
Yeah.
VINNY

Why didn’t you turn it off?

LISA
I did turn it off.

VINNY
Tf you turned it off, then why
am I listening to it?

LISA
Did it ever occur to you that it
could be turned off and drip at
the same time?

VINNY
No. Because if it was turned off,
it wouldn’t drip.

LISA
Maybe it’s broken.

VINNY
Is that what you’re saying? That
it’s broken?

LISA
Yeah, that’s it, it’s broken.

VINNY
(beat, toying)
‘Are you sure’?

Bill’s right, this guy loves to argue - and he’s apparently net

his match.

LISA
Positive.

VINNY
Maybe you just didn’t twist it
hard enough.

LISA
I twisted it just right.

VINNY
How can you be so sure?

LISA
Because I used 16 foot pounds of
torque.

VINNY
Is that an adequate amount of
torquage?

(CONTINUED)

(2)

LISA

(tosses him People

magazine)
Look in the manual, you‘’ll see
that particular nodel faucet
requires a range of 10 to 16 foot
pounds of torque. I routinely
twist to the maximum allowable
torquage.

VINNY
How can you be so sure you used
16 foot pounds of torque?

LISA
Because I used a Craftsman model
10-19, laboratory edition,
signature series torque wrench
~ the kind used by Cal Tech
high-energy physicists, and NASA
engineers.

VINNY
How do you know it was accurate?

LISA

(grabs Tampon box)
Because, a split-second before
the torque wrench was applied to
the faucet handle, it had been
calibrated by top members of the
state and federal department of
weights and measures to be dead-on
balis-accurate.

(tosses him directions

from Tampon box)
Here’s the certificate of
validation.

VINNY
'Dead~on-balls-accurata’?

LISA
It’s an industry tern.

Vinny listens, we hear the drip continue.

VINNY

is broken.

district attorney has to build
a case. Building a case is like
building a house, and each piece
of evidence is one more building
block. He wants to make a brick
bunker of a building with serious,
solid-looking, bricks like this...

He indicates brick two feet thick.

Yeah...

He pulis playing cards from shirt pocket and takes out an ace.

got straight sides, he’ll show
you it’s got the right shape,
he‘’1l show it in a special way
so it appears to have everything
a brick should have. But, there’s
one thing he won’t show you. When
you look at the bricks from the
right angle...?

...they’re as thin as this playing
card. His whole case will bea
magic trick -- which is an
illusion.

big stacks of decuments. Lisa looks up. She’s reading.

LISA
What’s all that?

VINNY
Trotter’s files -- all of them!

 

LISA
You stole his files?

VINNY
No, I was just starting to finesse
him when he offers to have his
secretary copy everything, then
he insisted I double check to make
sure she didn’t miss anything!

LISA
That’s very impressive finessing.

files?

VINNY
I told you.

LISA

to book)
He has to ~- by law...you’re
entitled. It’s called disclosure,
you dickhead.

(waves the book at him)
He has to show you everything or
it could be a mistrial. He has
to give you a list of al) his
witnesses. You can talk to all
of his witnesses. Ha‘s not
allowed any surprises. They
didn’t teach you that in law

Yeah, I killed a little baby
deer...in front of its mother.

LISA

In front of it’s mother?

VINNY
Yeah. But that’s not the worse

opens an eye - there's something in the bed. He throws the
covers back and jumps out of bed. Lisa wakes up.

LISA
Whatsa matter?

VINNY
Something in the bed. Like a ...I
don‘t know ... a rat, or ...

In a flash, Lisa‘s out of the bed, along side Vinny.

VINNY

vinny yanks back the sheet ~ a tarantula-sized cockroach
scampers towards Vinny.

LISA
Look out it’s coming towards you!

Vinny jumps back - it goes under the bed. Vinny picks up a shoe
and hands it to Lisa.

VINNY

Mr. Gambone, I’m not going to let
you take part in jury selection
tomorrow. I just got a fax fron
the New York State Office of
Judicial Records -they have no _
records of any Vincent Gambone °*

the entire state of New York.

VINNY
You’re not going to find any
records of Vincent La Guardia
Gambone practicing in any court.

JUDGE
(impatiently)

Twelve men and.women sit in the jury box as Trotter qualifies
their suitability as JURORS. The first JUROR is a grim
middle-aged woman. Stan, Bill, Vinny, Lisa and Gibbons watch. *
More than 30 other potential jurors sit in the public seats, *
waiting. *

TROTTER
Can you participate in an endeavor
in which the ultimate result might
be death by electrocution?

JUROR
I think it should be left up to
the victim's families rather than
the courts,

TROTTER
The defendants are charged with
robbing a convenience store, tying

up the clerk, and shooting hin
point-blank in the back of the
head.

to prove these facts, would you...

fingernails clattering over the roof like a giant frightened
cockroach. Vinny jerks awake. WE HEAR IT AGAIN. Vinny looks
to the left. WE HEAR ANOTHER ONE. Vinny looks right. Vinny

The snake stares at Vinny. Gradually, Vinny realizes that the

Terrified, Vinny tries to speak but no sound comes out of his

BILL
Yeah.

vVinny’s day in court has finally arrived - he’s been waiting for
this moment for ten years. Slowly, the thought (nearly) sobers
and wakens him. He pours some water from the pitcher onto his
hand and splashes it on his face to help wake himself up. Stan
and Bill exchange looks and shudders with sympathetic dread.
VINNY rises and approaches the witness. Rain has stopped.
Gradually, sunshine comes in through the windows.

TIPTON
They were kinda walking away from
me.

VINNY

Would you say you got a better
shot of them going in, but not
Tuch comin’ out?

TIPTON
You could say that.
VINNY
I did say that. Would you say
that?
TIPTON
Yeah...

Is it possible the two youts who

What is a yout?

VINNY
I’m so sorry, your honor, two
youths. Is it possible the two
youths who entered the store were
not the same youths you saw
leaving the store?

TIPTON
(beat)
No. Why would they get into the
same car?

VINNY
Let me re-phrase the question.
Is it possible that the two
defendants entered the store,
picked out twenty-two specific
items off the shelves, heated up
a burrito, had the clerk pour a
slush drink, take money, make
change then...leave, then, two
DIFFERENT men drive up ina
similar looking car, go in, tie
up the clerk, rob him, shoot him
and leave?

TIPTON
(shakes head)
No. They didn’t have enough time.

VINNY
How much time were they in the

Regular, creamy or al dente?

TIPTON
Uh... just... regular, I guess.
VINNY

in TIPTON

No self-respecting southerner uses
instant grits. I take pride in
my grits.

Vinny beams - he knows he’s got Tipton on the ropes.

VINNY
So Mr. Tipton, how could it take
you only five minutes to cook your
grits - when it takes the entire
qrit-eating world TWENTY minutes?

The JURY responds to this - they know their grits.
STAN AND BILL - are riveted.

kitchen than any other place on
the face of the earth,

TIPTON

I dunno.
VINNY

Perhaps the laws of physics cease
to exist on your stove?

Tipton shrugs.

VINNY
Where these ‘magic grits’? Did
you buy them from the guy who sold
Jack his beanstalk beans?

Mrs. Riley, were you wearing your
glasses when you viewed the

RILEY
Yes, I was.

VINNY
Can you put them on?

She opens her purse, takes out her glasses and puts them on.
They are ammazingly thick and make her eyes look huge ~ one
hinge is broken, repaired with a safety pin. The jury is struck
by how thick they are.

RILEY
Since I was six.

VINNY
Were they as...thick as these?

RILEY
oh, no. They got thicker over
the years.

VINNY
So, as your eyes have gotten more
and more out of whack as you’ve
gotten older, how many different
levels of thickness have you gone
through?

RILEY

Oh, I don’t know, over 40 years,

VINNY

Your Honor, may we approach the
bench?

{Judge nods)
I object to this witness being
called at this time, we've been
given no prior notice that he'd
testify, no discovery of any tests
he has conducted or reports he
has prepared and, as the court
is aware, the defense is entitled
to advance notice of all witnesses
who will testify, particularly
those who will give scientific
evidence so that we can properly
prepare for cross-examination as
well as to give the defense the
opportunity to have the witness’
reports reviewed by a defense
expert who might then be in a
position to contradict the
veracity of his conclusions.

This speech is said with great speed and fluency almost in one
breath, yet with total clarity.

Mr. Gambino, that is a lucid,
intelligent, well thought out
objection.

we compared the tire marks they’re
the same model and size tire;
Michelin model XGV, size 75-R,
14 inch wheel.

TROTTER
They’re both the same size and
model tire. What else did you
find?

WILBUR

eo The car leaving the convenience
store spun its rear tires
dramatically, and left a residue
of rubber on the asphalt. I took
a sample of that rubber and
analyzed it. I alse took a sample
of rubber from the rear tires of

JUDGE
(to Lisa)
Can you answer the question?

LISA
No - it’s a trick question.

JUDGE
Why is it a trick question?

LISA

Chevy didn’t make a 327 engine
in ‘55. The 327 didn’t come out
‘til ‘62 and it wasn’t offered
in the Bel Air with a four barrel
carburetor ‘til ‘64.

(adding)
However, in ‘64, the correct
ignition timing would be 4 degrees
before top dead center.

and jury are impressed. Vinny’s proud.

TROTTER
(reluctantly, but
undeniably impressed)

She’s acceptable.

vinny gets up.

The Judge

VINNY
Your Honor, this is. a photograph
ny fiancee took outside the
Sac-O-Suds. Can we agree on
this?

TROTTER

Yes.

VINNY
I’d like to submit this
photograph of the tire marks as
evidence.

LISA
You know I did.

VINNY
And what is it of?

LISA
You know what it’s of.

VINNY
Ms. Vito, it has been arqued by
ne, the defense, that two sets
of guys met up at the same
‘Sac~O-Suds’ at the same time in
Wahzoo City, Beechum County,
Alabama, driving identical
metallic mint green 1964 Buick
Special convertibles. Can you
tell, by what you see in this
photograph, if the defense’s case
holds water?

Lisa looks at the photo again, but this time...INSERT TIRE
PHOTO...something occurs to her ~ what she sees in the picture
in incontrovertible proof of the boys’ innocence - it dawns on
her, Vinny will win the case - and she can help. She looks at
Vinny, smug as he can he. Vinny shrugs amiably.

VINNY
Ms. Vito, could you please answer
the question? Does the defense
case hold water?

LISA
No. The defense is wrong.

VINNY
(beat, toying)
‘Are you sure’?

LISA
Positive.

VINNY
How can you be so sure?

LISA
Because there‘’s no way these marks
could’ve been made by a ‘64 Buick
Skylark.
(leoks at photo)
These marks were made by a ‘63

Pontiac Tempest.

TROTTER
(hisses)
Objection, Your Honor. Could we
clarify to the court whether the
witness is stating opinion or
fact?

JUDGE
(to Lisa)
This is your opinion?

LISA
It’s a fact.

VINNY
I can’t believe this kind of
information can be ascertained
simply by looking at a photograph!

LISA
Would you like me to explain?

VINNY
I would love to hear this.
JUDGE
So would I.
LISA

{referring to photo}
The car that made these two, equal
length tire makes, had
Positraction - You can’t make
those marks without Positraction,
which was not available on a ‘64
Skylark.

VINNY
Why not? What is positraction?

LISA

It’s a limited slip differential
that distributes power equally
to both the right and left tires.

{Trotter and Wilbur

quietly exchange

words.)
The Skylark had a regular
differential which...anyone’s
who’s ever been stuck in the mud
in Alabama knows that when you
step on the gas, one tire spins
and the other does nothing.

The jury knows that, and so does the judge, and the bailiff.
Trotter knows it too, and his lack of expression says so.

VINNY
Is that it?

LISA
No, there’s more.
(points to picture)
When the right wheel went up on
the curb, the left tire mark
remains flat and even. The '64
Buick Skylark has a solid rear
axle, so when the right wheel goes
up...
(demonstrating with her
fingers)
».ethe left wheel tilts out and
rides on it’s left edge. But this
didn’t happen here.

LISA (Cont‘d)

This mark is flat, which means
this car had...

{demonstrates with

fingers)
...an independent rear suspension.

(in sum)
Now, in the sixties, there were
only two other cars made in
America with an independent rear
suspension, Positraction and
enough power to make these marks.
One was the Corvette, which cannot
be confused with a Buick Skylark.
The other car, however, had the
same body length, height, width,
weight, wheelbase, AND wheel track
as the 1964 Buick Special, - and
that was the 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

VINNY
And, because both cars were made
by G.M., were both available in

Metallic Mint Green paint?

LISA
They were.

VINNY
Thank you, Ms. Vito.
(to Judge) :
No more questions, thank you, very
much, you’ve been a lovely
witness.

122.

vinny goes and sits down with the boys. The boys are elated
~they pat Vinny on the back. Vinny and Lisa exchange loving
looks. Trotter is having an animated conversation with Wilbur.

JUDGE

Mr. Trotter? Would you like to

question Ms. Vito?

Trotter and Wilbur appear to be arguing. Wilbur is shaking his
head, Trotter is pressing, Wilbur continues to shake his head.

JUDGE
Mr. Trotter...?

Wilbur shakes his head some more.

 

The Judge doesn’t like it.

Trotter looks like kh quarterback who dropped the ball as Wilbur
takes the stand.

Trotter’s sick. The Sheriff enters at the back.

VINNY
Is there anyway in the world that
Buick driven by the defendants
could’ve made those tire marks?

WILBUR
(thinks, shakes head)
Actually, no.

VINNY
Thank you. No more questions.

Vinny turns and sees the Sheriff at the back. The Sheriff nods
at him.

VINNY
(dramatically) -

Your honor, I call ... Sheriff
Farley,

There is a hubbub in the court. The Sheriff takes the stand.

VINNY
Sheriff Farley. £r...ah...

exactly to’ ask)
What did you just find out?

SHERIFF

out if there was any information

ona ‘63 Pontiac Tempest stolen

or abandoned recently.

This computer read-out confirms

defendants’ description were

arrested two days ago by Sheriff

Tillman in Jasper County,

Georgia, for driving a stolen

I’ve got to get out of here by
three. Are the bags in the car?

She nods and goes.

She goes, he turns in a rush and runs into Stan, who has an
impromptu thank you speech for Vinny. He cheoses his words
, "carefully" which feels endless for Vinny .

STAN
Vinny, I’m sorry to have ever
doubted you at any time. For this
I apologize. I think, under the
circumstances, that you did a...
fantastic job, and...

Right? You win case after case

go up to someone and say ...
"thank you". Oh my God - what

Vinny gives her a "look" - pretending he’s angry, but he’s not
at all angry. In fact he feeis desperately romantic. And Lisa

know it.

VINNY
I won ny first case. You know
what this means, don’t you?
