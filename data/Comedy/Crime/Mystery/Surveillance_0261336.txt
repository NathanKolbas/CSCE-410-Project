INT. SHERIFF'S CAR - SAME

As the sheriff stares at the empty cruiser in front of him,

then at the darkened interior of the bank. The glass in the

front door and one of the windows is SHATTERED. He reaches for
& radio.

SHERIFF .

EXT. NOEL TOWN BANK - SAME

As the sheriff gets out of his cruiser and slowly walks up to
the bank. He stands in the doorway a moment staring into the
dark interior. He unhooks a maglight from his belt, takes a

deep breath, and goes...

INSIDE THE BANK

As the sheriff shines his flashlight about the bank, the big
man starts to sing to calm his nerves...

    

We come on

He shines his light on th ick walls, the old brass rails,
the dried floral arrangements finally the western-themed
paintings, one of which is sp da with BLOOD.

He shines his light on the floor where we see a BODY -- a guy
with rasta dreads, blood-soaked shirt, his eyes wide open --
leaning against the wall just below the painting.

He then puts his light on ANOTHER BODY, this one bent over the

teller's window, bright red hair, arms inked full with tattoos
hanging down to the floor.

The sheriff shines his light on a GUN, lying on the floor just
beyond the dead man's reach in a pool of blood.

SHERIFF
+-+-I feel so broke up, I wanna go...

The sheriff shines his light on a JAGGED OPENING cut into the
side of the old vault; more blood on the floor over here.
SHERIFF
Home.

He crouches down to shine his light inside the vault when
suddenly, we hear A BEEPING SOUND. He listens as we hear it
again: PAGER.

The sheriff shines his light on the dreadlocked body on the
floor, then the body slumped over the counter. We hear the
BEEPING again and now Sheriff moves behind the counter...

As he shines his light on the floor back here, we now see ONE
MORE BODY lying face down -- an outstretched hand clutching a
pistol -- an ocean of blood coagulating around it.

The sheriff gently turns over the body so that we see a like
face staring vacantly back at us; the sheriff's light plays ng
off a BADGE pinned to a dark green uniform. We hear the ING

The sheriff reaches down and takes a BRIGHT RED PAGER from his
Deputy's belt and shuts it off.

He sees something on the floor, what looks like A BUSINESS CARD
in a pool of BLOOD. He picks de up, reads it aloud...

SHERIFF
I must not use the stairs or elevators,
it is not safe for me.

Phil hurries out as the PAGER STARTS BEEPING AGAIN and the
Sheriff turns once more to the dead deputy, and we then...

And then I shave.

Chris starts crying. Chris pauses, holds the razor.
CHRIS (V.0.)
I still cry for no reason sometimes,
but I'm getting a handle on it...
He takes a breath, calms down, resumes shaving as he cries.
JUMP CUT TO: CHRIS' BEDROOM

As we again see Chris sit up in bed and look around the room.

Little yellow " t-it" notes are everywhere. On the clock

Sparsely furnished, but comfortable, with a view onto a small
ark across the street. Chris comes into the room dressed in a
rayed sports coat.

CHRIS (V.O.)

He bumps into a chair, moves it aside, then grabs his keys from
a peg by the door as we...

As we once again see Chris sit up and shut off the radio.

CHRIS (V.O.)
I wake up.

This time, Chris turns and looks at US as we then...

JUMP CUT TO: A CLASSROOM

As Chris looks up from a paper on his desk. All around him are
other adult STUDENTS. Some have shaved heads or scars like

Chris. Most of them have canes or crutches leaning against
their desks or sit in wheelchairs.

The walls are full of posters and slogans from various Head
Injury groups and government agencies for the disabled.

VOICE
Thirty more seconds.

The TEACHER -- a black man in jeans and leather vest -- sits in
a wheelchair at the front of the room. On the chalkboard behind
him is written, "SEQUENCING ESSAY: YOUR TYPICAL DAY."

Chris looks down at his paper...

INSERT - CHRIS' PAPER

The last line he's written: I WOKE UP. He runs his finger a
few lines up to where he's also written I WOKE UP. And then to
the top of the page where he's written I WOKE UP...

The teacher starts roll, up the row, collecting papers. Chris
hands him his...

EXT. KANSAS CITY CENTER FOR I: : ENT LIVING - DAY
As Chris walks to a battered vic, pats his pockets for
his KEYS. He presses his face window and looks inside:
he's LOCKED THE KEYS IN THE CAR. le)yshakes his head like this
happens all the time and then sit. wn right there on the icy
pavement and takes off his SHOE.

INT. ANOTHER CAR - ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

Four figures, their faces bared in shadow, watch Chris.

ONE OF THEM
The fuck is he doing?

EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

As Chris pulls A SPARE KEY from his shoe, gets up and unlocks
the door. He then gets in the car and drives off as we...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL: A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR

Tinted windows so we can't see who's inside. A couple of the
fenders are dented, one of them patched half-assed with grey-
blue bondo. The Lincoln pulls out a moment after Chris does.

EXT. CROWNE CENTER - DAY

Basically, Kansas City's version of Rockefeller Center -- a
courtyard created by the Westin Hotel and the Crown Center
shopping complex with an ice rink and (this time of year) a
giant istmas tree in the middle of it all.

Michael Peretzian

Chris sits on a bench watching a group of YOUNG BOYS play ice
hockey. He picks out one of them in particular-- clearly the
best of the , a leader... a winner...

Chris' watch BEEPS. He automatically pulls his notebook from
his jacket pocket and consults it. le looks once more at the
kid tearing up the ice and then gets up and moves on.

He stops in front of the HOTEL, stands outside the glass and
peers inside.

HIS POV - THE LOBBY

Where we see A BLONDE, Chris' age, working behind the concierge
desk. She senses something, looks up at us...

REVERSE - THE FRONT WINDOW

But Chris is gone.

EXT. CHRIS & LEWIS' APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

As Chris drives up and gets out of his car. He starts to walk
away walks back and locks the door. He then stands there
loo! ing confused at the row of identical apartments...

The BLACK TOWN CAR drives to the end of the block where it slows
down, makes a u-turn and starts back this way.

Chris takes a few steps in one direction, then doubles back as
he spote A RED LIGHT one of the stairwells and starts up
at one.

INT. CHRIS' APARTMENT

As Chris comes inside and 3 down hard in the chair. He fishes —
a spiral NOTEBOOK from a Pee consults it.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY
As Chris comes in, moves to a T, RDER and turns it on...

LEWIS' VOICE
Okay, kid, the menu tonight is Penne
Puttenesca. That's that spicy pasta
with the olives you like. The tomatoes
are on the counter...

Chris picks up one of the cans of stewed tomatoes...

capers in a bowl inside the fridge...
JUMP CUT TO: THE KITCHEN

Chris taking a pot out of a cupboard and setting it on the stove
where we see another post-it that reads... 8.H.1.T.

CHRIS
Stove Hot If Touched.

Michael Peretzian
He turns the flame to low and backs away from the stove. He
opens a drawer, rifles it, can't find what he's looking for,
opens another one, and then another one. He then scans the
counter, looks inside the sink, and then under the sink...

CHRIS
Huh.

He stands there, confused. He ms the fridge, looks inside.
Not there. Okay. He pulls the fridge away from the wall and
looks behind it. Not there. He opens the oven, not in there.

CHRIS
Shit.

He stands up, breathing hard now, looks at the stove, grabs the
pot by the dle to look inside it and burns his hand--

CHRIS
FUCK!

--and flings the pot across the room. He shakes out his hand,
then stares in horror at the still unopened can of tomatoes on
the counter.

CHRIS
Oh, no...

EXT. CHRIS' APARTMENT - FROM THE PARK - SAME

We BEGIN TO PULL BACK so that we can see that Lewis sits in
front of a huge WALL OF RADIOS. Our ears are assailed by A
CACOPHONY OF DIFFERENT VOICES AND BROADCAST SOUNDS--

LEWIS
Police. Fire. Ambulance. Gas company.
Department of Water & Power -- anybody
out there using a radio, a cellphone .
or_a baby monitor -- I can hear ‘em
all from right here.

Glass on three sides. The busy newsroom as well as the colorful
"KNKC NEWSCENTER 9" set can be seen in the b.g.

Lewis -- dressed in a bright yellow sweatsuit, black& white

Lewis smiles, reaches for a dial marked "FIRE," turns it up.

LEWIS
Here she comes...

LEWIS

The voice of an angel -- the most

Two little girls exchange looks with each other, roll their
eyes at this guy.

LEWIS :
Now the second I hear a key word like
"lume" on the fireband, which means
smoke, I let the news director know
about it and he sends a camera crew to
check it out.

A couple of the kids make faces at Lewis. He keeps smiling.
TEACHER
Well, I see that Kristi Koochek is
ready to show us the anchor desk.
A peroxide ANCHORBABE waves from outside the booth.

TEACHER
Let's all thank Mr. Canfield for his

Michael Peretzian
' 10.
A chorus of "Thank you, Mr. Canfield."

LEWIS
Thank you. Come back anytime.

Lewis sits there waving as the kids all file out of the booth.

LEWIS
Bye now. Have fun. Enjoy the rest of
your tour.

A_couple boys linger in the doorway, making faces at Lewis,
flipping him off. Lewis is facing them, but doesn't react.

TEACHER
Matthew. Thomas. Get over here!
The boys hurry after their class. Lewis spins his chair back
around to face the radios and we now realize -- if we hadn't
yet already -- that LEWIS CANFIELD IS SLIND.

We HEAR A BEEPING. Lewis pulls a PAGER from his belt, hits a
button and we hear...

SOOTHING WOMAN'S VOICE
Voice Net. Message One.

Lewis calmly shuts off<t! er, reaches for the phone and

CHRIS
Did you hear what I said? I CAN'T

LEWIS
All right, I'l] call ‘em.

CHRIS
I looked everywhere--

LEWIS
One of us could've easily thrown it
out by mistake.

CHRIS
Why would we do that?!

LEWIS
Take a deep breath, kid.

CHRIS

What am I gonna do?
LEWIS
You're gonna get in your car, and you're

LEWIS

He takes a step towards the coffee table, stopping right before
it. He walks to the couch, stops right before it, too. He
walks back to the chair, moves it a foot to one side.

INT. LEWIS' BEDROOM - SAME

Neat and tidy; the bed perfectly made. Lewis comes in and opens
the closet. We see a dozen sweat-suits of different colors
hang above pairs of white sneakers all lined up in a perfect
row. Lewis hangs up his coat, walks back out.

INT. CHRIS' BEDROOM - S.

Chris lies asleep on @ bed. We hear A SOFT KNOCK and
then Lewis opens the d 8 ds there a moment, listening to
the sound of Chris breath#n: le then backs out of the room.

As Lewis comes into the dark Q. steps on something metal
and stops.

REVEAL: THE ENTIRE KITCHEN SP

The refrigerator door is open, and the light that spills out is
just enough for us to make out the total disarray. The cupboards
are all open, the oven, too. The trash has been dumped onto

the floor. The drawers have all been pulled out and utensils
are scattered all over the floor.

Lewis carefully moves through the room, assessing the exact
magnitude of the mess with his hands and feet. ie finally sighs,
bends down and picks up a fallen drawer.

INT. CHRIS' ROOM - LATER

We hear MAHLER coming from the next room. Chris stirs, opens
his eyes and sits up.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

The lights are still off in here. We see the form of Lewis
moving about the dark kitchen cooking as Chris walks in.

CHRIS
Hey.

LEWIS
Hey, kid.

Michael Peretzian
13.

Chris turns on the light and we see that LEWIS HAS CLEANED UP
THE KITCHEN. Everything back in its proper place. The floor
and the counter are immaculate. Chris watches as Lewis feeds
dough into a pastamaker.

LEWIS
You can go ahead, chop some lettuce,
cucumber, whatever else you want for
the salad.

Chris goes to the fridge as Lewis opens a cu} rd and we can
see that all of the foodstuffs have been marked with TACTILE
LABELS. Lewis feels around, finds what he needs. Chris stops,
looks around the kitchen...

CHRIS
Something happened in here before.
LEWIS
No problem. Don't worry about it,
kid. Let's talk about your test.
Chris sets to work as Lewis pours olive oil into a measuring
cup, the two of them working in comfortable sync.
LEWIS
What'd Reggie have you do?

CHRIS
List a typical day.

I,

I kept going ba 2, "I woke up."
LEWIS.

CHRIS
A story, like how?

LEWIS
You know, like, "Once upon a time, I
woke up, took a piss, got in the shower,
beat off..." -- like that. See if
that doesn't help.

CHRIS
I don't know how to tell a story.
LEWIS
Then_use one you already know as a
model.
CHRIS
I don't know any story.
LEWIS
You know "Goldilocks and Three Bears?"

CHRIS
Where's the fucking cucumber?

Michael Peretzian

Lewis grabs one from a strainer in the sink, holds it up for

LEWIS

What's gotta happen first for that
story to work?

CHRIS
I don't know? Who gives a shit?

LEWIS

Come on. Think.
CHRIS

(beat)

The porridge's gotta be too hot.
LEWIS

Okay, then what?
CHRIS

The bears gotta go for a walk so it
can cool off.

LEWIS
Then Blondie walks into the house,
breaks a chair and goes to sleep.

She eats the porridge first.

Chris and Lewis at the table. Lewis pours himself a glass of
wine.

LEWIS
Your mother called. She wants to invite
me to Thanksgiving dinner.

CHRIS

CHRIS
Yeah, that's gotta be it.
Lewis knocks back some of the wine.
LEWIS
It's either that or she wants all her

CHRIS

I gotta go to work.
INT. CHRIS' CAR - NIGHT
Driving away from the city now. Dark farmland on either side
of him. Led Zeppelin on the stereo. And then we pass a sign
that reads "WELCOME TO NOEL."
EXT. MAIN STREET - NOEL, KANSAS - NIGHT

As Chris parke his car behind a building and gets out. He holds
his jacket closed against the cold, goes around to...

THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING

Which we can now see is THE NOEL TOWN BANK.

INT. NOEL TOWN BANK - NIGHT

Where we see the DOOR to the VAULT is wide open. Chris mops
the floor as the manager, MR. TUTTLE -- heavyset, in a ten-year-

old brown suit -- pulls the door closed, moves to a small metal
door mounted on the wall and opens it.

Michael Peretzian
16.

Three COMBINATION DIALS are inside. The door is on a spring-
hinge so Mr. Tuttle has to hold it open while he sets each of
the dials. He sets one, then sees is standing there.

CHRIS
You're working late.

MR.
Turn around, please.
Chris turns his back as Mr. Tuttle sets the other two dials.

CHRIS
The USDA money must be coming.
Mr. Tuttle looks at him. Chris smiles, says by rote...

CHRIS
It comes twice a year, once for pre-
planting and again in harvesting.

MR. TUTTLE
How do you know about that?

CHRIS
I've been working three afternoons a
week with Mrs. Lange. She told me the
subsidy checks went out and that we'll
probably be pretty busy next week.

TUTTLE
We will inde busy... which is why
I'd like yor<to te down "Bank Extra
Clean" in yo t notebook.
But Chris just stands_the: we hear several LOUD CLICKS as

the timelock bolts all slant h Mr. Tuttle then starts for
the door.
MR. worm 5
Good-night .

CHRIS
You said you'd think about giving me a
couple of hours at the window.

MR. TUTTLE
We've been over this, Chris, you have
to be able to add and subtract many--

CHRIS
I'm going to school. math skills
are a lot better now. jait--

Chris walks to a LITTLE DESK at the back of the bank. It's
full of post-its and notebooks. Photographs of a younger Chris
and a BLONDE in Polynesian outfits standing in front of a fake
beach backdrop... is in a HOCKEY uniform... Chris and his
FATHER, both with shotguns under their arms.

CHRIS
One second--

Mr. Tuttle watches impatiently as Chris opens the drawer --
more notebooks in here -- rifles through them until he finds
the one he's looking for, flips back a few pages as_he walks

over to Mr. Tuttle and starts to read, stammering slightly...

Michael Peretzian
17.

CHRIS
A good teller is primarily a good
counter. A teller counts and keeps
track of money all day long, taking
care to keep the corners on bills turned
straight and facing the same way.

Mr. Tuttle checks his watch, shifts his weight, doesn't bother
to hide how antsy he is to get the hell out of there.

CHRIS
At_the end of the day, the teller
balances the cash in the drawer against
the payrout tickets. Now is really
the test of a goot. teller.
teller can go for years without! being
eut of balance. Mrs. Lange says she's
never been out of balance yet.

Mr. Tuttle rolls his eyes at that one.

CHRIS
But, of course, the real key to being
a good teller isa friendly personality.
That's how you get customers to open a
new account, or buy a CD or somet: ig.
The motto of a good teller is Be
« friendly and accurate.

But mostly be accurate.

Where Chris sits alone at the crowded bar drinking a Sharpes
and watching the other patrons mingle, socialize.

As Chris watches, A GROUP_nearby raises their glasses as A GUY
makes a toast. Chris smiles, raises his own glass. .

The Guy cracks a joke, the group cracks up. So does Chris,
even though he didn't quite hear what they said. He drinks
with them. He turns away, sees the BART! ER watching him.
BARTENDER

Two-fifty. For. The. Beer.
Chris fumbles about for the right amount of cash, pays his tab.

BARTENDER
Thank. You. Very. Much.

The bartender gives Chris his version of a grin, moves away.
Chris takes a sip, looks around the bar. Suddenly, his eyes
get heavy, he's about to nod off when--

BARTENDER

Chris looks over as A-WOMAN sits down on the stool next to him.

Chris is trying to think’ thing to say when A MAN -- black
leather jacket, open-coll shirt tucked into black jeans

over black boots -- comes uf le her, doesn't look at her as
he orders a drink:

Chris watches as The Man now comes around to face the woman,
sees she’s watching the pool players.

You like pool?

Lewis sits down at the other end next to Dorothy on one side,
Cameron's date on the other. Dorothy opens a prayer book...

DOROTHY
If everyone will join hands...

Everyone bows their head, takes the hand of the person sitting
next to them. Cameron's date looks at Lewis who holds up his
hand. She hesitates, then finally takes Lewis' hand. Chris
looks about at the other stiffs at the table as...

DOROTHY

sports equipment. The only thing out of the teenage-ordinary
is the HOSPITAL BED that sits under a window.

Chris comes into the room and takes _in the hockey pogtezs the
cluttered desk... carefully avoids looking at the bed until he
has to. A DUFFEL BAG sits at the foot.

He looks over a bookcase full of titles like Don Quioxte and
The Odyssey and The Brothers Karamazov -- books for when one
has got nothing in life but time.

Chris finally moves to the duffel bag, unzips it and looks over
the contents, a few items of clothing, his old hockey uniform,
a yearbook. He flips through pages of that...

Bartender sets the phone down on the bar in front’ of him.

The guy doesn't react, doesn't move. Hell, with those dark
shades, it's hard to tell if the guy's even looking at Chris.
Chris watches as Gary grabs a passing waitress, pulls her down

to him and whispers something in her ear. Whatever it is, it
makes her smile. Gary then turns back to Chris...

GARY
What do you think of my club?

The Waitress reappears with a bottle of Patron on a tray and
some shot glasses. Chris watches as Gary pulls out a ck

roll of cash and peels off several bills, and hands them to
her. Gary pours them each a shot...

CHRIS
I'm really not supposed to drink.

One shot won't kill you.
Marty slides the glass to Chris. They all raise their glasses.

An interesting thing: every time that Luvlee kisses, abs,
nibbles on Chris, Marty gives the girl in his lap a kiss,
squeeze, whatever.

Chris watches as Gary flashes his cash roll for the waitress,

busboy, whoever, always peeling a few bills. He notices how
Luvlee and Maura watch, too.

out of a coat and tie -- bumps into Gary and spills his vodka
cranberry all down Gary's front.

Finance it, how?

 
  
 
   
 

Gary smiles, walks over to the pool table. He crouches down,
opens a door underneath and looks up at Chris.

GARY -
Take a look. e

The hidden cupboard is full of CASH.

CHRIS
Is that real?

(laughs)
Goddamn right, it's real.

CHRIS
Jesus... How much is that?

Michael Peretzian
sé.
GARY
Three million, little more. Go ahead,
take a better look.
Chris looks at Gary, then reaches in and grabs a brick of cash.

GARY
How's it feel?

CHRIS

Good.
GARY

--Right?
CHRIS

Real good.

They both smile, then something occurs to Chris.

CHRIS

Where'd you get it?
GARY

Where's money usually come from? I
stole it from a fuckin bank.

Chris looks at Gary, the smile gone now.

GARY
You up for s hing like that?

Something 11) a!
GAR’
Walking into a bi middle of the

CHRIS

I don't know...

GARY
You afraid?

Then, before Chris can answer.

GARY
Because I know I would be, I were you.
I've been to prison before and I don't e
ever wanna go back.
(then)
The simple truth is, Chris, you're
smart enough, you can get away with
’ cluding murder.

This gets Chris' attention.

GARY
You just gotta be careful, you gotta
take your time, and you gotta plan.

Chris nods like he's in total agreement.

Michaet Peretzian

GARY
And, in our case uu gotta pick the
absolute right bank. 3 P

CHRIS
Absolutely.

YY
Something in the middle of nowhere.
Little farm bank where they get all
that U.S.D.A. money. You know what
I'm talking about? The four to five
million cash that comes twice a year?

CHRIS
Farm subsidy money.

GARY
Gotta be rich these days to be a farmer,
Chris.

CHRIS
Absolutely.
(then
So we'd be stealing money from farmers?

GARY

No, Chris, we'd be stealing money from

the gov . And who really gives

GARY
No one even knows the 5p. RRS

CHRIS
Where did you say?

GARY
After all, isn't that the very same
reason you drive an hour and a half
each way to work there?
All of a sudden Chris looks like he might fall over.
CHRIS
I can't rob a bank.
GARY
You just said you could.
CHRIS
I wasn't serious.
GARY
Well, I took you seriously.

Chris looks at the cash still in his hand, quickly puts it down
on the pool table like its contaminated...

Michael Peretzian

GARY
I don't know, but if I got my life
ripped out from under me the way you
9. yours_ripped out from under you,
'a give less than half a shit ut
what's right and wrong anymore.

CHRIS
That was my own damn fault.

GARY
That's irrelevant. The point is,
want your old life back, don't you

CHRIS
What do you think?

GARY
Sorry. It's too late, you can't have
it back. No matter how hard you try.
And you know it.

Chris turns away and Gary moves to stay in front of him.

GARY
But I tell you what, Chris, I can give

even better.

CHRIS

GARY
There's a difference, Chris, between
making a living and having a life.

CHRIS
I'm learning about the banking business.

GARY
In fucking Noel, Kansas?

Michael Peretzian

Chris doesn't answer that. Gary laughs.
GARY
I went to prison for my sins, so I
don't. carry them around with me. Your
old man a tab, so now you
drive out Old Farm Road 24 once a week
to leave your flowers and keep fresh
in your mind, case you forgot, just
what a piece a shit you are.
Chris doesn't move.
GARY
You know what the irony is? The biggest
fuckin Joke of all?
en
Now that he's stepped up for you ur
old man respects you even Jess thak

u_respect yourself. Which means,
e'll never step up again.

I don't need my father for anything.

Hey; Chris, I just showed you three

I'm talking about the man has no fateh
in you. I'm talking about you as! ™m

CHRIS
If I asked my father for money, he'd
give it to me.

GARY
Yeah? Really? Tell you what--
Gary takes out a cellphone, sets it down on the pool table.

GARY
Let's call him right now and ask him.

GARY
Ask him if he'll loan you ten grand.
Ask him if he'll loan you one grand.

CHRIS
For what?

GARY
Tell him you have an idea, you wanna
start a business. It reaily doesn't
matter what you say-- he's not gonna

Chris stands there looking at Gary a moment. We hear LAUGHING,

if anybody ever comes by after that.

GARY
We go too late, any loud noise ina

CHRIS
What do you mean "loud noise?"

GARY
I'm talking about if the cutting torch
doesn't work and we end up having to
blow the vault. We're gonna need some
highway noise to cover for us and that
stops around midnight.
Chris looks at the photographs, the equipment...

CHRIS
So all I_have to do is let you in the

being every time he kills someone, he
wears the same pair of gloves his old
man used to wear back when he was a

Chris looks at the Bone, the guy shaking, drenched in sweat.
He steps forward, puts his gun to Chris's face.

a far corner. MUSIC COMES FR( RE DOWN THE HALL...
CUT TO: ANOTHER ROOM

Once a workroom, now set up as a kitchenette. A hot plate,

milk cartons, cereal boxes, soup cans, etc. are all over the
lace. THE MUSIC IS A LITTLE UDER IN THIS ROOM, BUT COMES
‘ROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.

LUVLEE, spiky hair, an extra large Pep-Boys t-shirt and pink
panties -- puts a CELLPHONE down on the counter, then moves
about the room bopping to the music while fixing a tray of food
(bologna sandwich, cookies, milk).

As she gets on her toes and reaches for something on a high
shelf, her t-shirt hikes up and we see_a SMALL PISTOL tucked _
into the back of her panties, the muzzle evidently nestled nice
and warm between her cheeks. On her feet, she wears a pair of
work boots; protection against all the bolts & screws.

Yessiree. Our kind of giz. She picks BP. the tray and starts
out of the room. We follow her through the maze of debris-strewn
hallways. Twice she has to stop, retrace her steps...

LUVLEE
Oh, fuck me...

She passes a room set up as a kind of bedroom. Down this hall,

then that one. Into another room where bright sunlight streams
in through the windows.

Michael Peretzian

Luvlee bops over to the counter, takes A KEY RING FROM OUT OF A
COFFEE , drops it on the tray and starts back out...

She walks down the hall to the next room, starts to unlock the
door as we then...

CUT TO: INSIDE THE ROOM

The MUSIC IS DEAFENING IN HERE. Mattresses cover the windows.
A bare bulb illuminates Lew: ni s hands
covering his ears. As in the rest of the place a. { around him,
the floor is littered with bolts and screws.

A "clearing" has_been swept away for him to sit in the center
of the floor while a "path" in the shrapnel leads to a toilet.

Behind him we see the door slowly swing open on its own. A
moment later, we see LUVLEE'S BARE LEG teasingly extend into
the Soorway - The rest of her, as in some bad strip routine,
slowly following.

Lewis, for his part, remains totally unaware; his senses too
preoccupied with the musical assault coming from the stereo
speakers mounted high up on the walls, out of his reach.

Now Luvlee's dancing with the tray, moving closer to Lewis.
She sets it down right in front of his face.

He smells the food, reaches out and touches the tray. Alert
now, he straightens up..,

I

Hello?!
Luvlee stands nearby, wat: as he reaches out and touches
the food on the tray. She ff her shirt, throws it to
the floor nearby. le feels t ze it makes as it settles.
LEWIS

Someone there?!

Topless now, she dances around him, moving her body close to
his face. He turns his head this way and that as he gets a
whiff of her, senses her moving past him...

LEWIS
(shouts)
Luvlee?! That you?!

She pulls a PURPLE SCARF from one_of her boots now and begins
twirling it about, and then finally blindfolds Lewis with it.

LEWIS
Ha. Ha.

She kisses him on the top of the head, picks up her shirt, dances
her way back out of the room. The MUSIC STOPS. She reappears
a moment later, pulling her shirt back on.

LEWIS

INT. PRATT KITCHEN - NIGHT

As Chris comes inside, straightaway opens the fridge, gulps
down half a carton of orange juice, shoves an apple in his mouth,
then hurries out of the room.

INT. CHRIS' OLD BEDROOM - NIGHT

As Chris heads for the closet, takes down the long "Mustangs"

duffel bag. He dumps out the yearbook, the hockey equipment;

then st 6 to stuff some of 8 old clothes into the bag. He
peels off his blood-splattered shirt, pulls on his old hockey

jersey. He starts out of the room, pausing for a quick second
to look at himself in the mirror: e old Chris.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

As Chris walks past, backs up, comes into the room. He stares
at all of the photographs of his father and him: at the hockey
xink, hunting, shooting clays fishing by a lake. He picks up
a trapshooting trophy and looks at it-a moment...

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
The duffel bag rests on the kitchen table foodstuffs and a six
pack of soda sticking out of it now. Chris sits at the table
writing a note. He finishes, looks a moment at what he's
written, then grabs the big duffel bag and walks out.

We HOLD on the note a moment, see "MOM AND DAD" written on the
outside in Chris' jagged scrawl. We hear THE DOOR CLOSE 0S.

the car and drives away.

Chris' car parked just off the road, headlights on. Chris, in
the wash of the headlights, shovels dirt back into a hole that
he's dug in the freshly cultivated earth. He finishes, takes
out his notebook, makes a note...

He then walks to where his car is parked and throws the shovel
in the back, which we can now see is EMPTY.

He walks around, gets in the car and drives away. We BOOM DOWN
TO where we see CHRIS' NOTEBOOK lying in the dirt.
