Kkeilled Nynant he wired Macaulay, using Wynent's
mame and told him to shut up the shop. He des-
troyeé all of Wynent's clothes, with +. the ex-
ception of his gateh chain: He figured that some
a@ay that might come in handy. Then he took
Wynant's becy ané buried it in the shop with
another man's clothes to threw us off the track.
He evan put a belt buckle with en “R" on 4t, hope
ing that we'd think it was Rosewater -- an old
enemy of Wynant's who arcpped out of sight years
age.

After our hero had illed Wynant, he gct 8

still collect money. ¥Wynant wes supposed to te oo
a trip - no one knew where - so Our dinner quest
wrote letters tq Mecaulay, signing Wynant's name;
so that Macauley weuld continue to send the money
to Julia. He even telephoned Macauley --

if it weren't his voice. .

Oh he was clever about that. He called when you
were out. Theat same afterncon, Julia telephoned to
him: She said thet you were coming, Mimi, to esk
about Wynant. He got terrified. He wes afraid thet :
