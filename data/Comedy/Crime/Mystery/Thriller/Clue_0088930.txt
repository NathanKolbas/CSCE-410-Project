CLUE

FADE IN:

EXT. A HOUSE ON A HILL - NIGHT
MUSIC: :

We are looking up at a house. It stands some distance
away, on a hill. From the moment WE SEE it we know that
it is a house of terror -- imposing, Gothic, gloomy,
menacing. Perhaps it is reminiscent of the house in
Psycho, perhaps -- though not a castle -- it has the
deserted soulless empty quality of Kane's house when
seen first through its gates.

The MUSIC WE HEAR is Thriller music, urgent strings,

‘suggesting panic, suggesting unspoken evil. Bernard

Hermann sort-of-music.

And the weather is overcast. There is a watery moon
struggling to break through racing clouds. -But a
thunderstorm is on the way.

Superimpose: MAIN TITLES

A car turns off a ‘highway onto a country lane leading
towards the house. The car would not be the-cat's whiskers
even in the year in which this story takes place.

END TITLES - SUPERIMPOSE "1954"

CAMERA ‘CRANES DOWN .and MOVES WITH the car AS it approaches
the gates of the house. They are closed. A man gets out
of the car. He is a BUTLER. He is dressed like a butler.
He has the manner of a butler. Even when opening gates
all alone he does so with the demeanour of a butler. ‘His
name is WADSWORTH. Having opened the gates, he sits back
in his car, and motors slowly up the private drive.

EXT. THE FRONT. DOOR - NIGHT

As THE BUTLER's car draws to a halt, there is a distant
RUMBLE of THUNDER. Lights can be seen through some of

the ground floor windows. A savage looking German Shepherd |
snarls and bares his teeth .at the arriving car. Another
German Shepherd is crapping on top of the front steps.

Both dogs are chained up.

WADSWORTH gets out of the car, locks it methodically, and
mounts the steps to the front door. ‘One of the dogs leaps
at him, trying to attack him. He throws a chunk of raw
meat at the dogs. They fall upon it hungrily, and retreat
to the side of the steps. WADSWORTH is relieved.

(CONTINUED)
     

REVISED 3/26/85

CONTINUED:

He steps back, eyes them - satisfied - produces a key
from his overcoat pocket, turns, steps in the dog
shit. :

INT. THE HALL - NIGHT

Methodically, WADSWORTH opens the front door. It creaks.
He comes in sniffs, makes a face, scrapes his shoe, shuts
the door, hangs up his coat on the coat stand. He wears
a black jacket, white tie, stiff collar and poinstripe
trousers. He walks across the marble floor, his foot-
steps echoing on the cold, grey stone. He stops at the
open Dining Room door and looks in. The table is
beautifully and meticulously laid for dinner for seven.

*

INT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

YVETTE is the French Maid. She is young, beautiful, with
a great figure which is tightly encased in a maid's uni-
form -- black dress, little white apron and cap, sheer
black stockings and dainty black shoes. But the skirt is
shorter than normal, and very tight over her bottom --
and her black dress is very low cut. Her ample bosom is
pushed right up and half out of the top of the dress.
She is an outrageous young lady, with an improbable French
accent which cannot be reproduced on the page. She has
been polishing a glass, and dancing to the latest poo
music on the radio. She bends forward to replace the
glass on the tray, her breasts falling beautifully forward.
WADSWORTH watches.
WADSWORTH |
Is everything ready?
YVETTE
Oui, Monsieur.
WADSWORTH
You have your instructions.

WADSWORTH leaves the library, YVETTE sniffs and makes a
face. WADSWORTH crosses the hall to the kitchen.
YVETTE looks at the bottom of her shoes, puzzled. We
HEAR a METALLIC SCRAPING SOUND.

   
 

 

   

INT. THE ‘KITCEEN - NIGHT

WADSWORTH comes in. The COOK, a plump but

inscrutable Chinese lady, is methodically sharpening *
a large shiny carving knife on a steel. In the
background is ‘film of SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY of
Wisconsin on a 1950's black and white TV set, per-
forming characteristically at a hearing on the House
Committee of Un-American Activities. (Actual film).

WADSWORTH
Everything all right, Mrs. Ho?

She stands-up, face to face with him.

MRS. HO
Dinner will be ready at nine-thirty.

‘And she settles down and watches the TV as WADSWORTH
leaves.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
A MAN'S hand -grasps hold of the bell-pull. Pulls.

INT. BELL TURRET - NIGHT
The bell jerks and clangs.

INT. THE HALL - NIGHT

WADSWORTH is crossing the Hall. The bell stops
clanging. He looks at his watch and nods. Every-
thing in order. He opens the door. WE SEE a
smartly turned out MAN. He is eyeing the dogs.

WADSWORTH
Good -evening.

He steps aside. But the MAN does not.come in.
The MAN's car is parked in the drive. The dogs
are back ‘beside their kennel, eating.

MAN
Good evening. I don't know if...

He falters. WADSWORTH comes to the rescue.

WADSWORTH
Yes indeed sir, you are expected,
Colonel.

The word 'Colonel' seems to reassure the MAN alittle.
He steps in, and WADSWORTH closes the front -door.
(CONTINUED)

 

 
8 CONTINUED (2):

WADSWORTH
2 (continuing)

May I take your coat? It is
Colonel ‘Mustard, isn't it?

He holds out his hand.

COLONEL MUSTARD
(for it is he!)
No, that's not my name. I'm
Colonel...

WADSWORTH holds up his right. hand, sharply. COLONEL
MUSTARD flinches. ‘He reminds -us.a little of Colonel
Hall in “Sergeant Bilko".

* “WADSWORTH
Forgive me but tonight you may
well feel obliged to my employer .
for the use of a pseudonym.

COLONEL MUSTARD didn't quite get all that. WADSWORTH
turns and-hangs up COLONEL MUSTARD'S coat on hook. The

COLONEL eyes him:suspiciously, and sniffs the.air, .and
then looks at his own feet.

SS Who are you?
WADSWORTH

I am-Wadsworth, sir. The Butler.

 

COLONEL MUSTARD

And he leads the way across the Hall. COLONEL MUSTARD

enters with reluctance and suspicion, looking up and

around the. high cold Gothic hall, lit by a flickering

chandelier and shafts of moonlight stealing through the
stained glass windows. .

“9 INT. LIBRARY = NIGHT

YVETTE is pouring champagne at the -drinks table, as
WADSWORTH and COLONEL MUSTARD enter. YVETTE and the
~ COLONEL look at each other with particular interest.
WADSWORTH notices.

WADSWORTH
Yvette, would you attend to the
Colonel and give him anything
he requires.
(a beat)
( Within reason, that is.

CONTINUED:

There is a RING at the DOORBELL again ... WADSWORTH
leaves, shutting the door behind him softly. The door,
like all the walls, is covered in bookshelves. COLONEL
MUSTARD turns to speak to WADSWORTH just as the door has
closed. He can't even see where the door was.

COLONEL MUSTARD
Wadsworth... (realizes)
Where'd he go?

EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

MRS. WHITE is standing there. She is a pale, tragic but
beautiful looking woman in her thirties. Dark har and
eyes, white skin, dressed in black. WADSWORTH opens the
door. ~

WADSWORTH
Do come in, Madam, you are
expected. :

She reminds us of a woman from a Charles Adams cartoon.
She is holding a letter.

MRS. WHITE
Do you know who I am?

WADSWORTH
Only that you are to be known
as... Mrs. White.

MRS. WHITE
It said so in the letter. But why?

_She steps inside. He helps her off with her coat.

He hangs it up. She sniffs, wrinkling her nose in
distaste. Then she checks her feet.

INT. THE LIBRARY

COLONEL MUSTARD is still looking for the door handle.
YVETTE is handing a drink to COLONEL MUSTARD. Suddenly
the door opens, and flattens him against the wall.
WADSWORTH enters, followed by MRS. WHITE.

WADSWORTH

Ah. May I introduce you -- Mrs.
White, this is Yvette, the maid --

(MRS. WHITE AND. YVETTE

flinch on seeing each

other)
I see you know each other.

(CONTINUED)

 
     

al CONTINUED:

MRS. WHITE and YVETTE eye each other -- then their eyes
Cy turn, in fear, to WADSWORTH. COLONEL MUSTARD appears.

 

WADSWORTH
- Are you all right, Colonel?

12 EXT. THE COUNTRY LANE - NIGHT

A rumble of THUNDER. A stunningly attractive woman,
whom we. shall call MISS SCARLET, is bending over the
open hood of her automobile. She is staring at the:
engine inidespair. She gets into the car, and turns
the starter again. The engine is dead.

In the distance she sees headlights coming toward her.

She tries to attract the attention -of the passing car.
13 INT. PROFESSOR PLUM'S CAR - NIGHT -

PROFESSOR PLUM is driving along.

He is listening to SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY coming live

froma hearing: of The House ‘Committee on Un-American
Activities. (Actual recording.) .He sees MISS SCARLET,

rl. and eyes her carefully as he drives past. Deciding that
Assit she's rather a dish, he slows down, stops and reverses
é back to her.

PROFESSOR PLUM
What's the trouble?

MISS SCARLET
My car.

PROFESSOR PLUM
Want a lift?

“She hesitates.
PROFESSOR PLUM
(continuing; leering)
It's perfectly safe.
MISS SCARLET

Yes, please. I'm late for a
dinner: date.

She gets in.

CONTINUED:

PROFESSOR PLUM
Me too. Where are you going?

MISS SCARLET
You know this part of the world?

PROFESSOR. PLUM
Nope. .

MISS SCARLET
Me neither. *
(she -gets a letter out
of ‘her purse.
I'm going to Hill House ... off
‘Route Forty-One.

PROFESSOR PLUM catches sight of the letter heading.

PROFESSOR PLUM
Wait a minute. Let me look at
that.
(he takes it from her
and .and ‘looks at it)
That's where I'm going. I got
a letter like this.

They look at each other with a mixture of interest and
suspicion. Heavy drops of rain start to fall-on the
windshield. He starts the windshield wipers, and
drives on. : :

INT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

WADSWORTH is introducing MRS. PEACOCK to MRS. WHITE and
COLONEL MUSTARD. MRS. .PEACOCK is a wealthy woman, with
jewels and a fur stole with fox tails and claws dangling
from-:it. She has considerable vanity .

WADSWORTH
And this is Mrs. Peacock.

COLONEL MUSTARD
How do you do?

MRS. WHITE
Hello.

WADSWORTH
Yvette, would you please go and
check that dinner will be ready

just as soon as.all the guests
have arrived? (CONTINUED )

~ YVETTE goes. .WADSWORTH too. MRS. PEACOCK watches her
go, with slight incredulity. YVETTE has apparently been
poured into her tight little dress.

Then MRS. PEACOCK sniffs and surreptitiously checks her
feet, then looks at the others' feet.

EXT. THE. HOUSE - NIGHT

Two more cars are parked in the driveway. MRS. PEACOCK's
and the car belonging to the dapper young man, tall, slim,
bespectacled and exquisitely turned out, who waits by the
front door.

WADSWORTH opens “it.

MR. GREEN
Is this the right address to
meet Mr. Boddy?

WADSWORTH nods and stands aside to. admit him. —

: WADSWORTH
You must be Mr. Green.

MR. GREEN nods anxiously. One of the two dogs is
straining.at the leash.

WADSWORTH
(continuing; firmly)
Sit!

MR. -GREEN immediately sits, on a chair just inside the
front door. WADSWORTH turns and sees him.

WADSWORTH .
(continuing) :
No, not you, sir.
INT. PROFESSOR PLUM'S CAR - NIGHT
PROFESSOR PLUM is. driving. MISS SCARLET is map reading.
MISS SCARLET
It should be just along here.
EXT. THE GATES - NIGHT

From the P.0.V. of the house and gates, WE SEE the car
turn off the road towards the house. The car stops.

CONTINUED:

PROFESSOR PLUM and MISS. SCARLET's P.O.V., WE SEE the
Gothic mansion. It is magnificent, imposing, and scary.
There is a tremendous flash of forked lightning, then .a
CRACK of THUNDER.

MISS SCARLET
Why has the car stopped?

PROFESSOR PLUM
It's frightened.

Another tremendous THUNDERCLAP and flash -- it is as if
the Gods are angry with Hilltop House. PROFESSOR PLUM
re-starts the engine, and as the .car moves ‘forward
through the gates the heavens open. A cloudburst. ‘Rain
beats down on the car and the gravel drive. Palm ‘trees
bending, nearly flattened ‘by the gale~force winds.

INT. .THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

COLONEL MUSTARD, MRS. WHITE, AND MRS. PEACOCK are standing
around with their glasses of champagne.

YVETTE offers one to MR. GREEN who takes it. They are
all aware of the tremendous ‘storm outside. Their eyes
turn apprehensively towards the mighty leaded windows,
which rattle as the rain drums against them.

EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

PROFESSOR PLUM and MISS SCARLET are hurrying out of their
car,. and up to the front door,. amid the torrential .
downpour. They RING the DOORBELL, and look about. In
only the few steps from the car they are soaking wet. He
is protecting her from the rain, his hand around her and
his -coat over her head.

‘PROFESSOR PLUM
(hushed)
What a God-forsaken place.

They look around, under the cover of the front porch.
WADSWORTH opens the door. He is surprised.

WADSWORTH
Professor Plum and Miss Scarlet?
I didn't realize you were
acquainted.

MISS SCARLET
We weren't.

INT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

COLONEL MUSTARD, MRS. WHITE, MRS. PEACOCK, and MR. GREEN
are standing around nervously, not talking to each other,
looking up and around at the great bookcases filled with
leather-bound volumes. WADSWORTH enters with PROFESSOR
PLUM and ‘MISS SCARLET.

‘WADSWORTH
May I present ... Professor Plum,
-and Miss “Scarlet.

They nod. He takes a silver salver from YVETTE and offers
the two glasses to MISS SCARLET and PROFESSOR PLUM.

MR. GREEN takes one. ' They all sip thier champagne. The *
log fire crackles and spits.

WADSWORTH
(continuing)
Of course, since you have each
been addressed by a pseudonym,
you will have realized that
nobody here is being .addressed
by eir real name.

-They all glance nervously at each other, with renewed

suspicion. ‘Suddenly there is .a terrifying CRASH!
Everyone jumps. MR. GREEN's champagne shoots out of
his glass and all over himself and MRS. PEACOCK.
CUT TO: |

INT. THE HALL

 

It -is the GONG, being forcefully struck by THE COOK.
INT. THE LIBRARY/HALL/DINING ROOM

WADSWORTH
Ah, dinner,

MR. GREEN is mopping up MRS.. PEACOCK.

(CONTINUED)

22 CONTINUED:

MR. GREEN
I'm sorry, I'm a little accident
prone.

 

And he leads everyone out of ‘the Library and across the
Hall. As they come into the Hall, THE COOK vanishes
into the Kitchen. WADSWORTH leads on into the. Dining
Room.

23 INT. DINING ROOM

‘They all crowd in through the door..and hesitate as they
see the beautiful long mahogany table, set.as if for a
college feast -- silver -cutlery, Wedgewood china, candles
and crystal decanters and goblets of varying sizes for
various wines. A vision of ‘Elegance.

WADSWORTH (V.0.)
You will find your names beside
your places. Please be seated.

They all sit at the table. Three on each side. There
is one empty place, at the head of the table. .

COLONEL ‘MUSTARD
Is this place for you?

a WADSWORTH
Indeed no, ‘sir. I «am merely a
humble butler.

COLONEL MUSTARD
Hmm! So. what exactly do you do?

WADSWORTH
I buttle, sir.

COLONEL ‘MUSTARD
Which means what?

WADSWORTH
The butler is head of the Kitchen
and dining room. I keep
everything... tidy, that's all.

COLONEL MUSTARD
I see, /

CONTINUED:

MRS. PEACOCK
(sitting)
Well, what's all this about,
Butler? This dinner party.

WADSWORTH
(smoothly)
"Ours not to reason why
Ours but to do and die... "

PROFESSOR PLUM looks up anxiously.

PROFESSOR PLUM
"Die"?

MUSIC! But WADSWORTH is ‘smiling reassuringly.

WADSWORTH
Merely quoting, sir, from Alfred
Lord Tennyson. .

COLONEL MUSTARD
I prefer Kipling myself. "The
female of the species is more
deadly than the male."

The LADIES.all stare at him coldly. He picks up a plate

of hors d'oeuvres and offers it to MISS SCARLET.
COLONEL MUSTARD
(continuing)
Do ‘you like Kipling, Miss Scarlet?

MISS SCARLET
Sure, I'll eat anything.

YVETTE has been going round the table, with soup bowls.

‘ YVETTE
‘Shark's fin soup, Madame?

MRS. PEACOCK gets some, then MISS SCARLET, then MRS.

WHITE, then PROFESSOR PLUM, and COLONEL MUSTARD. COLONEL

MUSTARD indicates the elegant Chippendale upright
armchair at the head of the table.

COLONEL: MUSTARD
So is this for our host?

CONTINUED (2):

WADSWORTH
No sir -- for the seventh guest.
Mr. Boddy. :

All the GUESTS look at each other, somewhat surprised.

MRS. WHITE

I thought Mr. Boddy was our host.
THE OTHERS

So did I!
MRS. WHITE

So who is our host, Wadsworth?

WADSWORTH ignores the question. But he is pouring the
wine -- perhaps he did not hear it.

PROFESSOR PLUM
Well, I'm going to start, while
it's still hot.

He picks up his spoon, then sees that not everyone has
been served.

MRS. PEACOCK
Shouldn't we wait for the other

guest?

YVETTE
I will keep ‘something warm for
him.

MISS SCARLET
(acidly) :
What did you have in mind, dear?

PROFESSOR PLUM sees that everyone has been served. He
starts eating. So do the others. The slurping sounds
of soup being eaten, as delicately .as possible, as
everyone is aware that they are all watching ---and
listening -- to each other. BIG CLOSE-UPS or TWO SHOTS
of each of the SIX GUESTS in turn.

YVETTE goes out to the Kitchen, followed by WADSWORTH.

After eating in silence for a while, MRS. PEACOCK speaks
nervously.

MRS. PEACOCK
Well...

(CONTINUED)

 
 

 

14.

23 CONTINUED ‘(3)::

All heads turn towards her. She loses her nerve
momentarily, then continues, speaking rather too quickly
with a slight air of hysteria.

 

MRS. PEACOCK
(continuing)

Somebody's got to break the ice,

so it might as well be me. I mean,

I'm used to being a hostess, it's

part of my husband's work, and

it's always difficult when a group

of new friends meet together for

the first time to get .acquainted,

so I'm perfectly prepared to

start the ball rolling, I mean,

I have absclutely no idea what

we're doing here or what I'm

doing here or what this place is

about but I'm determined to. enjoy

myself and very intrigued and oh -
my, this soup is delicious, isn't
it?

 

 

 

There is a pause. They all still looking at her.

MRS. “WHITE
You say you are used to being a
hostess as part of your husband's :
work?:

 

MRS. PEACOCK
Yes. It's an integral part of
your life when you're the wife
of a... :
(she stops herself)
But then, I forgot, we are not .
supposed to say who we really
are, are we, though Heavens to
Betsy. I don't know why.

COLONEL MUSTARD

 

Don't you?
There is another silence. MR. GREEN is staring at MRS.
PEACOCK.
MR. GREEN
(quietly)

I know who you are.
MRS. PEACOCK looks at him, surprised. :

‘CONTINUED (4):

MISS SCARLET
(mischievously)
Aren't you gonna tell us?

MR. GREEN shrugs. It's not up to him to say, but
MRS. PEACOCK can't leave it alone.

MRS. PEACOCK
How do you know who I am?

MR. -GREEN
I work in Washington too.

PROFESSOR PLUM
Washington?
(he looks at MRS. PEACOCK)
So you're a politician's wife?

MRS. PEACOCK realizes she has to brazen it out.

MRS. PEACOCK
Yes, I am.

They all stare at her, waiting for more information.

COLONEL MUSTARD
Come on then -- who's your husband?

The door opens suddenly. They all jump.a little.
WADSWORTH comes in. He indicates to YVETTE to come in'
and collect up the soup bowls. She does so in a tense
silence, and departs with WADSWORTH, who closes the door
behind them. Meanwhile, the conversation has

continued.

MRS. PEACOCK
And what does your husband do?

. MRS. WHITE
Nothing.

MRS. PEACOCK can't work out what MRS. WHITE means.

MRS. PEACOCK *
Nothing at_all? *
MRS. WHITE

Well, he just lies around on his
back all day.

MISS SCARLET
(dryly)
Sounds like hard work to me.

23 CONTINUED (5):
O They all look at MISS SCARLET. Suddenly a panel shoots
up behind them. They all jump. MR. GREEN spills food
or wine over MISS SCARLET. . *
MR. GREEN
I'm sorry, I'm a little accident
prone.

WE SEE it is a hatch into the Kitchen. YVETTE is
placing the main course in the hatch.

YVETTE
Excuse moi.

In the b.g., indistinctly, WE SEE COOK dishing up'‘food.

WADSWORTH comes into the Dining Room, and starts placing

the main course in front of each guest. It is Chinese

food -- a couple of bland looking main dishes with rice,
noodles and so forth. MRS. PEACOCK tastes it. |

MRS. PEACOCK ;
Mmm. Delicious |
(she glances admiringly
through the serving hatch)
This is one of my favorite recipes.

© WADSWORTH edges in front of the pass-through, so that *
MRS. PEACOCK -cannot ‘see the-COOK.

 

WADSWORTH
I know, Madam.

She looks at him with further curiosity. WADSWORTH
starts to pour the wine, topping up one or two glasses. 7

MRS. PEACOCK |

So what do you do in Washington :

: D.C., Mr. Green? |
|

MR. GREEN smiles and shakes his head. MRS. PEACOCK
persists.

MRS. . PEACOCK
(continuing)
Come on, what do you do? How
are we to get acquainted if we
don't say anything about ourselves?

 

 

MR. GREEN smiles a wintry smile.

“ MISS SCARLET
\ a Perhaps he doesn't. want to get
” . acquainted with you.

Cy Well, I don't know I'm sure.

conversation going we'd all be
sitting here in.an embarrassed

PROFESSOR PLUM
(curious)
Are you frightened of silence,
Mrs. Peacock?

-MRS. PEACOCK
(frightened)
No -- why?

PROFESSOR PLUM
. It just seems to me that you
are. You seem to suffer from
what we call pressure of speech.

: MISS SCARLET picks this up at once.

. MISS SCARLET
‘We? Who's "we"?

PROFESSOR PLUM hesitates.

MISS SCARLET
(continuing)
Are you a shrink?

PROFESSOR PLUM
Er... I do know a little about
psychological medicine, yes.

‘ MRS. WHITE
You're a doctor?

PROFESSOR PLUM
(evasively)
Iam, but I don't practice.

: MISS SCARLETT
But practice makes perfect.
(suggestively:)
I think most men need a little
practice. Don't you, Mrs. Peacock?

MRS. PEACOCK doesn't know what she's talking about.

MRS. WHITE
So what do you do, Professor?

PROFESSOR PLUM
I work for UNO. The united
Nations Organization.

COLONEL MUSTARD is not impressed.

COLONEL MUSTARD
Another politician? Jesus.

PROFESSOR PLUM
No. I. work for .a branch -of UNO.
W.H.O. The World Health Organization.

MRS. PEACOCK
What's your area of special concern?

 

 

PROFESSOR PLUM |
Family planning. \

MISS SCARLET
‘So, if we ever want to find out
about you know what, we could
go to UNO Wha?

 

MR. GREEN smiles .a little. They :eat in silence.

PROFESSOR -PLUM
So what about you, Colonel .
Mustard? Are you a real Colonel?

| COLONEL MUSTARD
. (diginified)
Iam, sir.

And COLONEL MUSTARD continues eating.

MISS SCARLET
You're not going ‘to mention the
coincidence that you also live
in Washington, D.C.

They all look at her, then at him. COLONEL MUSTARD stops |
eating, a forkful of food half-way to his mouth. . |

COLONEL MUSTARD
How did you know that? Have we met
before, Ma'am?

MRS. PEACOCK

Washington, D.C.?

I don't.

MR. GREEN is thinking.

MR. “GREEN
Yes, ‘but you work for UNO. A
government job. And the rest
‘Of us all live ‘in .a-government
town. Anyone here not earn
their living from the government
one way or another? .

They all look at each other.
COLONEL MUSTARD stands up.

COLONEL MUSTARD
Wadsworth -- where is our host,
and why have we been brought here?

WADSWORTH smiles enigmatically. And the DOORBELL RINGS.

INT. THE HALL

WADSWORTH walks down the Hall to the front door. TENSE
MUSIC. He opens the door, and standing there is an
unprepossessing MAN. One might almost describe him as
ugly if one were feeling charitable. Certainly his
features are ordinary enough, but there. is about ‘him an
air of malevolence, bitterness -- perhaps even evil! He
also bites his nails and picks his ‘teeth, nose, and other
orifices. He carries .a-small locked suitcase. As the
door opens there is a tremendous flash of lightning and

a CRASH ‘OF THUNDER.

WADSWORTH seems pleased to see him, in an odd sort of way.
WADSWORTH
Ah, Mr. Boddy. ‘You are eagerly
awaited.

This is not your place, I take
it?

WADSWORTH
No sir. It is on loan.

He steps aside to allow MR. BODDY to enter. He does.
MR. BODDY looks WADSWORTH up and down, with a sneer on
his already unpleasant features.

MR. BODDY
And what are you ‘supposed ‘to be?

WADSWORTH is closing the front door. The wind is howling.
WADSWORTH

I'm supposed to be polite.
Though when talking to you, I
find that the task is almost
beyond me.

They are talking loudly enough to be heard in the Dining

Room.

Yes, it's a long haul.

All the GUESTS are eating in silence. WADSWORTH enters,

followed by MR. BODDY. Everyone turns to look at MR. BODDY

MR. GREEN flashes a look at them both. Again he is quick

MR. BODDY

They all stare accusingly at PROFESSOR PLUM.

PROFESSOR PLUM
(angrily)
I-don't know. I'm-not a forensic
expert.

MRS. WHITE comments in her soft-spoken way:

MRS. WHITE
But one of us must have killed
him.

This quiet observation produces a fearful silence. They
all look at each other nervously, aware that .a murderer
is present amongst -them.

MR. GREEN
Iodidn't do it!!!

MRS. PEACOCK
I need a drink.

She puts down the dagger and picks up the brandy goblet
that MR. BODDY placed on the table near the door just
before the lights went out. She raises it to her lips,
and sips a little.

PROFESSOR PLUM
Maybe he was poisoned!

MRS. PEACOCK screams, and drops the glass. She continues
screaming, hysterically. After some moments of continued
screaming, MR. GREEN slaps her ‘face.

This stops her, abruptly.

They all look at him. More violence! Is he the murderer?

MR. GREEN

They all hurry over to the sofa and stare at MRS. PEACOCK.
She seems all right.

From another room comes a TERRIBLE SCREAMING SCOUND. *
They all freeze, and stare at each other in terror. Then,
at once, MR. GREEN starts screaming too.

MR. GREEN
‘Aaaaaaaagh!

COLONEL MUSTARD

The ‘screaming from the other room is still continuing too.
‘COLONEL MUSTARD grabs MR. GREEN by his lapels, then slaps
his face.

MR. GREEN

there on the. floor. MRS. PEACOCK sits on the sofa
again. They stare at the scene.

MR. GREEN
Is there no indication of how
he died?

PROFESSOR PLUM
No.

ANGLE ON WADSWORTH

 

WADSWORTH
This is terrible. This is
absolutely terrible. This is ‘
not what I'd intended. OH MY

He crosses to a chair and sits. MRS. WHITE realizes the
full impact of his remarks.

MRS. WHITE
Not what you intended?

Then they all stare at him. WADSWORTH mops his brow.

 

MISS SCARLET
So you're not the Butler?

WADSWORTH
I'm not the butler. But I am
a butler.” In fact,. I was his
butler.

And WADSWORTH points to the body of MR. BODDY.

PROFESSOR PLUM
So if he told you to invite us

They all take a seat. Unfortunately there are only

WADSWORTH
When I said that I was Mr. Boddy's
butler, this was both true and
misleading. I was once his butler,
but it was not his untimely death
this evening which brought my
employment with him to an end. Oh,
no!

COLONEL MUSTARD
When did it come to an end?

WADSWORTH
When my wife decided ‘to... end
her life. She too was being
blackmailed by this odious man
who now lies dead before us. He
hated my wife for the same reason
that he hated all of you. He
believed that you were all thoroughly
un-American, For some reason he
felt it was inappropriate for a
Senator to have a corrupt wife, -for
.a doctor to screw his patients, for
a wife to emasculate her husband,
and so forth.

He is speaking wihtout irony. WADSWORTH is a very
sincere fellow who always tries to understand.

MR. GREEN
But this is ridiculous. If he was
such a patriotic American, why
didn't he report us to the relevant
authorities?

WADSWORTH
He decided to turn his ‘information
to good use and make a little money
out of it. What could be more
American than that? Hr.Boddy was
truly an apostle of free enterprise.
He became -a rich man...

He rushes out of the Study. The OTHERS follow.

INT. THE HALL

Led by WADSWORTH, they all rush to the front -doer.
WADSWORTH throws open -the door, pulls :back his arm
rapidly -- preparatory to throwing the key into the

The MOTORIST thinks that WADSWORTH is about to punch
him, and he ‘half ducks and puts up his hands to defend
himself and to stave off the attack. WADSWORTH's
throwing arm ‘freezes.

WADSWORTH
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. ‘Um...
can we help?

MOTORIST'S. POV

He ‘sees that eight people are packed into the front door,
‘Staring at -him-with -varicus expressions of fear,
suspicion, and ‘hysteria.

MOTORIST
I'm sorry... I didn't.mean to
disturb the whole household...
but my car broke down out here
and I was wondering if I could
use your -phone?

. WADSWORTH
Just a moment, please.

MOTORIST'S POV - ALL EIGHT PEOPLE

turn in amongst themselves for a hasty whispered
-conference. -- Occasional words float out of the huddle:
"He wants to use the phone"... "I say ‘'no'"... "What's
he doing round here?"... "How can we say no?"... “All
right? Yes. Yes. Agree."

WADSWORTH turns, and tries to look as dignified and
normal as possible.

WADSWORTH
Very well, sir. Would you
like to come in?

The MOTORIST steps in. ALL EIGHT PEOPLE just stare at
him.

The MOTORIST, realizing that all eyes are on him,
follows WADSWORTH in an exact imiation of WADSWORTH's
idiosyncratic walk.

‘WADSWORTH indicates the phone to the MOTORIST.

WADSWORTH
When ‘you've made your call, perhaps
you would be good enough to wait

COLONEL MUSTARD leads off to the Library. ALL follow.
As they pass the Study door, the COLONEL stops and looks
in. MR. BODDY and the COOK are still lying dead on the
‘sofa.

COLONEL MUSTARD

Everyone stands around nervously. COLONEL MUSTARD pours
himself a stiff drink, and tries to take charge.

Well, what do you suggest??

The COLONEL pulls himself together and takes a swig of

have caused his brain to seize up.

COLONEL MUSTARD
There seems to be confusion
about whether or not we are
the-.only people in this ‘house.

WADSWORTH is getting angry now.

WADSWORTH
I told you there isn't.

Yes.

PROFESSOR PLUM looks around at the OTHERS. Clearly he

There is a pause, while they all consider what
happened to the COOK.

MR. GREEN

Are you willing to take that

COLONEL MUSTARD
What choice have we? : *

He waits, expecting a chorus of agreement. After
several moments, they all mutter -- "none;' ‘course *
not, ' not awfully convincing.

WADSWORTH, followed by ALL THE OTHERS, crosses the
Hall to the Kitchen.

INT. THE KITCHEN

WADSWORTH comes into the Kitchen, crosses to a drawer,
and produces a sharp carving knife. He turns abruptly,
knife in hand. THE OTHERS gasp, ‘step back, WADSWORTH
is unaware of this. He sets about cutting the

matches into eight different lengths. Then, carefully,
his back the THE OTHERS, he places the matches in-his
hand so that no one can tell their lengths. He turns
to face them.

WADSWORTH
Ready? The shortest with the
‘second shortest. Agreed?
And let's say the two shortest
search the cellar, and-so on up.

They nod and, -one by one, .accompanied by TENSE MUSIC,
they pick out the matchsticks. Then ‘they compare
lengths. And the result? WADSWORTH is paired with
MRS. WHITE, YVETTE with MR. GREEN, COLONEL MUSTARD

go up the main stairs. COLONEL MUSTARD and MISS SCARLET

slowly down the road towards it.

There is a COP alone in the patrol car. He sees the
MOTORIST's abandoned car. He eyes it suspiciously.
He pulls up some way past the MOTORIST's car.

removes the key from the lock in the Lounge door.

ANT. THE STUDY

We see the desk inthe Study. On it lies the
envelope from which WADSWORTH has earlier withdrawn
the letter which he reads to all the GUESTS.

The GLOVED HAND pulls the envelope from the desk. It
pulls out NEGATIVES and PHOTOGRAPHS, one of MR. BODDY,
another of THE COOK, another of MR. GREEN. Then one
of the MOTORIST, the MOTORIST, in Army uniform, at the
wheel of a Jeep.

NEW ANGLE

The photographs of COLONEL MUSTARD and YVETTE which
were earlier left on the table, are being examined.
We also see some letters and other papers. Then they
are stuffed back into the envelope, which is thrown
on to the blazing log fire. It burns up.

CAMERA MOVES WITH the GLOVED HAND, ACROSS TO the
cupboard. They key is inserted into the lock, the
door opens, and the weapons are revealed.

And she grabs a bottle of brandy from the sideboard.

MISS SCARLET and PROFESSOR PLUM whizz across the Hall and
into the Lounge just as MR. GREEN and the COP emerge from

doors.

Those two rooms.

Oh, those two rooms!

Yes.

after him, grabs his arm, and stops him.

The lights are off. The PHONOGRAPH is PLAYING, softly.
"I Ain't Got No Body,” an old 78 rpm record.

The COP switches the light. On the sofa MRS. WHITE is
sitting on the knee of the dead MR. BODDY. She is kissing
him on the mouth. He appears, from the COP'S POV to be
embracing her - but we can see that his arms and hands
are being manipulated by MRS. WHITE-like a big puppet.
The COP sees this, and his eyes turn to another couple:
the COOK is standing up in a corner, her arms around
COLONEL MUSTARD, and he appears.to be kissing her. The
COOK's hands are moving through his hair.

NEW ANGLE .

In the corner, we see that COOK's hands are behind her
back, and MRS. PEACOCK is concealed behind COOK - and it is
MRS, PEACOCK's hands which are caressing COLONEL MUSTARD.

The COP turns to MR. GREEN, who is watching open-mouthed.

CoP
It's not all. that shocking. Folks
are just having a good time.

He leaves the room, followed by MR. GREEN. MRS. PEACOCK
comes out from behind the dead COOK. She is looking
demented.

MRS. PEACOCK
Oh, my God!!

MRS. WHITE stops kissing MR. BODDY.

MRS. PEACOCK _

the bottle. He bends down and sniffs his breath.

He's drunk. Dead drunk.

Dead right.

The COP shakes the MOTORIST. The bottle slips to the floor.
The MOTORIST, not.surprisingly, doesn't wake up when shaken.
The COP bends down towards his ear.

COLONEL MUSTARD and MISS SCARLET enter the Kitchen.
COLONEL MUSTARD eyes a different cupboard door. He
moves steadily toward it, opens it -- and a fold-up
ironing board drops out and hits him on the head. He
reels. Then he looks around. His eye is caught by the
cupboard out of which the COOK fell.

He opens the door. It looks like a big broom cupboard.
Then, with an eerie creak, the back wall of the cupboard
moves -- and opens. Another secret passage!
