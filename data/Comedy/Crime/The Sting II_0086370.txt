THE STING, PART II
THAT'S WHY THE LADY IS A TRAMP

 

FADE IN
EXT. ATLANTIC CITY NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

It's a balmy night in August, 1940. We open on the exterior
of a swank Atlantic City nightclub, its dazzling facade
illuminating a passing parade of hipsters, which stops like
a freeze dance every time the club door opens and allows a
few bars of the music within to escape. It's the dream of
every hipster that a party of fifteen will come out, keeping
the door open long enough perhaps to hear Ziggy Elman's
entire trumpet solo on "Body and Soul'.

ANOTHER ANGLE

This time, however, only a couple emerges, accompanied at
best by a few diminished eighth notes. The man, elegantly
dressed and refined in manner, is immediately recognizable
as Kid Twist, the bogus telegra h operator in "The Sting."
On his arm is a statuesque blonde in clinging crepe. ey
proceed to a cab and slide in the back.

INT. CAB

As Twist leans forward to give instructions to the cabbie,
he fails to notice that the woman slides right out the other
side. He turns to find that her place has been taken by a
huge hulk of a man who says nothing and stares straight
ahead. Twist has seen that look before and moves to get out
the way he cam in, only to find that there is now a thug on
the other side of him too. This one closes the door beside
him and assumes the same pose as his friend. Twist realizes
that he's in trouble. The cabbie pulls out with no word
from the thugs. It doesn't matter. He knows better than
they do where they're going.

INT. A DOWNTOWN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The camera moves in slowly on a man sitting alone in the
dark, his head partially illuminated by the lights from the
amusement park across the street. The only sound in the
room comes from an unseen fan. The camera stops when we're
close enough to realize that the man is Doyle Lonnegan the
gangster/mark of "The Sting." His eyes are set and far off,

his face lost in thought. A knock is heard at the door,

and Lonnegan jumps a bit as if someone had just snuck up

on him. We hear a voice outside. It's Floyd, Lonnegan's
right-hand man.

FLOYD
Doyle. Homer's downstairs. They
made a clean snatch on Twist. You
want us to dump him?

: LONNEGAN
No, bring him here. I wanta see
him first.
FLOYD
Okay.

there's no light
coming under
the door)

You all right in there?

I'm all right.

as Floyd walks on down the hall.

INT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL ROOM
Lonnegan slips back into his reverie. The camera starts to

move in on him again. We burn into his eyes, which never
blink despite the play of the neon across them.

We hear: A sound montage of the replay of the last few
minutes of "The Sting."

1. he voice of Lonnegan placing his half million dollar
bet with great bravado, the call of a race in the b.g.

2. Kid Twist telling Lonnegan that he's bet incorrectly
and will lose all his money.

3. Lonnegan trying frantically almost hysterically, to get
his money back from the cashier.

4. A fusilade of gun shots.

5. The voice of Detective Snyder urging Lonnegan out of the
betting parlor.

Again a knock is heard at the door.-

; LONNEGAN
Come in.

The door opens to reveal Twist and his two captors sil-
houetted in the doorway. Lonnegan reaches out and turns

on a light, and for the first time we are able to see the
room. It looks like an expensive suite in any luxury hotel,
except that the walls are covered with photographs, 8 x 10
blowups of every single man involved in the con of Lonnegan
some four years before. Prominently displayed above the
others, like the leaders of some Eastern European politburo,
are shots of Gondroff and Hooker.

Lonnegan allows Twist to take in the room before he speaks.
Twist tries heard not to notice the photographs.

_ LONNEGAN |
What do you think of my pictures
Twist?

TWIST

My name's not Twist, and I don't
know much about pictures.

would be up there.

been proud of you, Twist. I wish
you could remember it. I had hoped
it would have meant more to you to
take a man like me.

job beautifully done.

Lonnegan has attempted to deliver all this with a "no hard
feelings" attitude, but Twist is not fooled. He knows there
will be no reprieve for him. He decides to go out like a
champ .

. TWIST |
Believe me, Lonnegan, it was the
greatest day of my life.

EXT. RIVER FRONT - NIGHT

Lonnegan and Floyd are sitting in a car looking out over

the river to a warehouse on the other side. All the lights
are out in the warehouse, except for one on the second story
at the top of a fifty-foot-long loading chute which runs
from the second floor out over the water. It is normally
used to convey cargo from the warehouse to freight barges

LONNEGAN us
Get the word out that Macalinski

A body, feet encased in concrete, goes speeding down the
loading chute and disappears below the surface of the black
water.

LONNEGAN
That's one.

With a gesture to Floyd, Lonnegan sits back grimly, and
the car moves off.

Main title and opening credits.

EXT. JOHNNY HOOKER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY EVENING 8
We pick up Johnny Hooker washing himself in a makeshift

shower that he's rigged up on the fire escape of his one~

room apartment. He uses old bed sheets for a curtain and
his shower head consists of.a comb taped over the end of

a garden hose which runs in through the window to a faucet
on the small sink which occupies one corner of his totally
undistinguished room.

Hooker is obviously in an expansive mood, as he sings along
to the radio which he's hung on the landing above him.
It's playing Helen Ward's version of "Goody Goody" with the
Benny Goodman orchestra. His rinse water, meanwhile, drips
through the grating of the fire escape to the pavement six
floors below, watering several window boxes on the way.
Hooker finishes up, and climbs back through his window.

INT. THE MARINE ROOM OF THE STEEL PIER - NIGHT 11

One of the great ballrooms of the era, in a class with the
Roseland in New York and the Aragon and Trianon in Chicago.
Featuring an ocean of hardwood dance floor, divided here
and there into inlets and bays by the arrangements of the
tables, the Marine was a must play date for all the big
swing bands of the forties. Not as elegant certainly as
the supper clubs, but more exciting.

The band's female vocalist is just getting into "You Turned
The Tables On Me" as Hooker and Eirie enter the ballroom.

EIRIE
She's at table sixteen, on the left
toward the front.

HOOKER'S POINT OF VIEW - TABLE SIXTEEN 12

Hooker's eyes search the floor and finally come to rest on
table sixteen. He's not quite ready for what he finds
there. He had expected the Woman to be rich, but he hadn't
expected her to be beautiful. Regal in bearing, she has
the untouchable beauty of a Hedy Lamarr. The kind that
turns passing strangers into employees. Hooker's first
instinct is to turn around and go home. He has barely
noticed the Older Woman to_her left, who is plainly dressed
and exudes a professional protectiveness toward her com-
panion.

a complete professional now. He takes off his watch and
hands it to Eirie, then snatches a flower out of a vase
and puts it in his lapel. We follow him as he makes his
way over to table sixteen.

Hooker immediately affects the demeanor of an entrepeneur.

Eirie beats a speedy retreat.

Both women are visibly frightened to have been in the pre-

sence of such a man. Veronique glances down at where Eirie
was sitting and something catches her eye -- there's a gold
watch on the seat. She picks it up quickly and hands it to
Hooker.

I think it's your friend's.

passes it to Giselle, who dips into her purse and adds her
money to it. She turns her body as she does so, so that
Hooker cannot see how much money she has. Hooker is amused
by her modesty. Giselle then licks the envelope and seals
it.

HOOKER
May I have the envelope a second?

Giselle hesitates, but Veronique makes her hand it over.

HOOKER
All right, you take the envelope
and stick it up under your arm,
inside your coat, like this.

Hooker demonstrates by slipping the envelope inside his
tuxedo coat and up into his armpit. By shooting from the
side, we see that there is already another envelope there,
the one with the cut paper.

HOOKER
That way you can feel it all the
time, and no pickpickets will be
looking for it there.

He reaches back inside his coat and pulls out the envelope,
but of course it's not the one he put in. It's the one with
the cut paper. He hands it to Veronique, who thanks him and
hands it to Giselle, who tucks it up inside her coat, glanc-
ing both ways to make sure no one saw her do it.

HOOKER .
I am sorry for all the commotion
here tonight. I hope you enjoyed
your evening, Countess.

Giselle allows herself a little smile that Hooker is finally

using the proper term of address. The Countess nods that her
evening has been satisfactory, and Hooker takes his leave.

lie around in the sun a little, maybe
borrow a few bucks.

HOOKER
I'm not goin' down there with my
hat in my hand. He thinks I don't
know how to take care of myself.

EIRIE
He's not gonna be like that. He's

INT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY 29
Eirie starts off toward his room as Hooker tries to open
the door to his own room. Suddenly the door opens by

itself and Hooker finds himself looking at a large Man in
a food-stained undershirt.

MAN
Somethin' I can do for you?

Yeh, this is my apartment.

Hooker gives Eirie a look that could melt a brick.

the den.

Without further ado, he closes the door.

Hooker and Eirie start back down the stairs.
EIRIE
’ You ready to go see Gondorff now?

HOOKER
Yeah, what the hell. You got some
clothes you could lend me?

EIRIE .
Sure, but we don't have nothin' for

INT. THE ATLANTIC CITY RAILROAD STATION - NIGHT 31

We pick up Hooker and Eirie as they come into the station
and fan out in different directions. Hooker is wearing
Eirie's clothes, which look ridiculous on him, The pants

and seeing none, slips the badge into his pocket.

into the passenger lobby. Eirie passes him and slips him
the tin badge.

INT. TRAIN STATION - ANOTHER SECTION 34

After scanning the area carefully for a minute, Hooker goes
up to a conservative-looking Businessman, who's busy reading

the little tin badge and then quickly closes it again.

We pick up a heavyset, middle-aged man, known in con circles
as the Big Ohio, picking cases of bourbon off the conveyor
line and loading them onto a forklift pallet. A shift fore-
man happens by and hands him an envelope, hunching his
shoulders to indicate he has no idea what's in it. The Big
Ohio stops to open it and pulls out a photo booth picture
of Gondorff with his hand to his nose in the traditional
confidence man's salute (the "office"). Below the picture
is nothing but the words: JERSEY GARDEN. 8:30 PM. THE
FOURTH.

The Big Ohio smiles knowingly to himself. Suddenly we hear
the splintering of bottles as the rapidly piling up cases
begin to be crushed at the end of the conveyor, spilling
bourbon all over the floor. The Big Ohio could care less.

he's sleeping or on a con. He has them in twelve different

Typhoon dances out to even more scattered applause. Hooker
and Eirie have been visibly moved by the Announcer's intro-
duction of Taylor. What poetry.

HOOKER
You watch my guy, Henry. He's got
the greatest right I've ever seen.

IN THE RING 60

The bell rings and the fighters come out. Immediately,
Typhoon backs Healy into a corner and unleashes the famous
right. It misses, crashing mightily into a ring ost. It
danm near splinters the thing. Hooker wasn't kidding.
Taylor has a great right. Unfortunately, we're about to
find out what he doesn't have -- any defense. While
Typhoon is busy admiring the damage he's done to the post,
Healy blasts two shots to the body and a left hook to the
chin. Typhoon goes on his face.

Hooker jumps up immediately and hops down to ringside to
talk to Taylor, whose head is hanging over the side of the
ring.

HOOKER

to where he went down last time.

door and goes inside.

INT. SMALL MEETING ROOM 69

Instead of hanging beef sides in the refrigerator, we find
a small meeting room. Around the table in the center are
Gondorff, Eirie, Singleton, the Big Ohio and the Tuxedo Kid.
Gondorff is dressed in his usual casual attire -- sleeve~-
less T-shirt, fedora hat and cigar. The Tuxedo Kid provides
a splash of color with a lime-green number. Hooker pulls up
a chair.

GONDORFF
All right, let's get started.
What's the news on this guy, J.J.?

Singleton organizes some notes he's made.

SINGLETON
I tell ya, Henry, Macalinski's been
around. He started as a strong-arm
at a carnival. Then he ran a shell
game, a monte booth, even did some
of the magic when the magician was
too soused to go on. But most of
all, he discouraged the customers
from takin’ too close a look at how
they were losin' their money. They
say he still likes to do a trick or
two at his parties when he gets a
few drinks in him. A guy walked
out once when he was doin' a rope
trick. They found him the next day
with his feet in a drill press. He
never walked at all after that, let
alone out of a party.

This piece of information has a very sobering effect on the
group.

So if he's not a carney worker
anymore, what the hell is he?

BIG OHIO .
He became an enforcer for Gandi
Bellino in '34. At the time,
Bellino was tryin' to nail down
all the prostitution in the city.
He put Macalinski in charge of
his gunsels. After Macalinski _
finished torpedoing the opposition,
he torpedoed Bellino. Now he runs
more gris than anybody on the |
island. He's still a shitty magi-
cian, though.

INDORF’
He musta made a few enemies during
all this.

_ BIG OHIO

Yeah, but nothin' he can't handle.
He's got some sore spots, though.
For one thing, he can't stand
Negroes. Guys like JoJo Berry and
Willie Bates. He says they give
prostitution a bad name by sellin’
cheap. It really frosts his butt
when they pick up the good white
talent.

Gondorff says nothing, but we can tell this bit of infor-

mation is not lost on him.

GONDORFF
Okay. Tuxedo, what do you got on
his personal habits?

oo, TUXEDO KID
Macalinski's the glamour type.
Snappy dresser, big tipper, owns
the Bluebird Club down on the pier.
Buys a new suit every day, wears it
once and then burns it. They say

few I'm not acquainted with, but
his biggest weakness is the janes.
He thinks he's death to women.

GONDORFF
Is he?
TUXEDO KID
You never see him with less than
four.

This creates a general feeling of disgust around the table.
If there's one thing a grifter can't stand in a mark, it's
pretention.

GONDORFF
Do any of these dames ever stay
tight with him?

TUXEDO KID

Naw, he doesn't like women that much.
He just can't stand it when they
don't like hin.

a woman on him in the setup.

GONDORFF

experience.

TUXEDO KID
He'd be a perfect mark except for
the fact t he probably knows all
the standard cons from his carney

days.

GONDORFF
Then we'll have to go with a new
one. Watchin’ hoon the other

night, I got an idea for a fight
con that might be good for this

Everyone looks to Hooker. Hooker would rather they looked
at somebody else.

Naw, we need somebody who can grift.

And Eirie said you were a Golden
Gloves champion.

HOOKER
Yeh, but that was fifteen years ago.
GONDORFF
It couldn't be any worse than when
Lonnegan's guys were shootin’ at ya.
Hooker realizes it's useless to protest. He nods his head

in acceptance of his role.

He stops in the boxing section and tries on a few pairs of
gloves, testing the feel by throwing a couple shadow punches.

HOOKER
That's good enough. I just need
somethin' to sharpen up on.

As the Salesman goes to ring up the purchases, Hooker hap-
pens to glance across the store.

HOOKER'S POINT OF VIEW ~ THE LINGERIE DEPARTMENT 71

He sees something in the lin nge rie department he can scarcely
believe. The woman behind the counter. He looks closer.
No doubt about it. It's Veronique, the part-time Countess.

HOOKER

Hooker sneaks over toward the lingerie department, taking

great care not to let Veronique see him. He takes a detour
through the toy department.

Hooker pauses to lift a pair of handcuffs.

We are seeing a new side of Veronique. No phony French

her customers.

She doesn't get to finish the sentence. Hooker grabs her
arms and starts to handcuff them behind her back. Veronique

are shocked.

the direction of Singleton and The Big Ohio. Construction
goes on everywhere -- heavy bags are suspended from the |
ceiling, speed bags are affixed to the walls and a ring is
under construction in the center. In addition, dressing |
rooms are being built at both ends. Gondorff, at present, is
using one of them as an office. Hooker strolls through the

The most exclusive club in Atlantic City and definitely in
the tradition of the great supper clubs of the early forties.
Characterized by its bold deco design, satin curtains and
tablecloths and an elevated bandstand with its Busby Berkeley
backdrops, the Bluebird prides itself on its elegance. The
bandstand is actually divided into three tiers, the top tier
(containing the drummer and piano player) a flood twelve feet
above the floor, The waiters are all dressed in black tux-
edos, the band in tails, and the cocktail waitresses and
cigarette girls in tuxedoettes -- backless tuxedo jackets,
tuxedo shorts with cummerbund, high heels with spats, and
top hat -- much like the girls in Fatha Hines Grand Terrace

Eirie apologizes profusely, but receives nothing but verbal
abuse in return.

While Macalinski is busy toweling off his suit, Gondorff
comes over and attempts to dry Macalinski's hair with a nap-
kin. He makes one swipe, and’ suddenly Macalinski is bald.

VERONICA

Macalinski reaches for the top of his head and feels only
skin. He has a terrible realization as Gondorff looks in
his napkin and holds up a slightly soggy hairpiece.

Unfortunately, Gondorff pulls away slightly as Macalinski

He holds it up for Gondorff and Veronica to see.

As Macalinski takes the queen back from Veronica, he palms
it and replaces it with the card up his sleeve, It's done

with everyone assuming it's still the queen.

time, but it's still not difficult to follow the card that
should have been the queen. It ends up in the middle again.

Well, which one is it?

Gondorff studies the cards. It seems like there's no way he
can win. None of them are queens. Gondorff puts his hands
on the two outside cards.

EXT. THE BLUEBIRD CLUB ~ LATER THAT NIGHT 96

Macalinski, accompanied by three bodyguards, comes out a side
door of the club and walks down the pier to the amusement
center. He's generally in a foul mood, and has sent the
women home for the night. :

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 97

A couple of concessionaires say hello to Macalinski, but he
doesn't respond. As he reaches the park entrance, Hooker
approaches from the side. He's dressed more working class
now, complete with a Cagney beret. He adopts the speech
pattern of a prizefighter.

. HOOKER
Mr. Macalinski.

Hooker gets no acknowledgement from Macalinski, but is imme-
diately surrounded by two bodyguards. Macalinski walks on
ahead.

HOOKER
I wanta see Macalinski.

“BODYGUARD
He don't wanna see nobody.

. HOOKER
Tell him it's about Ivory Berrigan.

One of the bodyguards hustles ahead to Macalinski. They have
a short conference and the Bodyguard waves Hooker and the |
second bodyguard forward. Macalinski, however, doesn't wait
for them. He continues on toward his objective.

HOOKER
Where are we goin'? Can't I talk to
him here?

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - AT PARACHUTE JUMP ~ NIGHT 98

Finally Macalinski reaches his destination -- the famous
Parachute Jump, an awesome tower of steel reaching 300 feet
into the air, culminating at the top in a brightly lit eight-
pronged platform. Suspended by long cables from each prong
of the platform are the flimsy-looking two-seater chairs,
which now dangle a few feet off the ground waiting for the
next round of riders. Having no weight in them at this
point, the chairs swing slightly in the breeze, sending
Pinging noises up the cables which just seem to disappear
in the dark sky above. Not a ride for the faint of heart.
The Operator of the parachute is quite familiar with
Macalinski.

. OPERATOR
Evening, Mr. Macalinski. Oughta be _
able to see all the way to Philadelphia

Macalinski just nods. For the first time, he turns to face
Hooker, who has caught up by now.

Hooker looks up at the tower. He's not at all sure he wants
to get in that seat.

Hooker nods weakly and gets into the seat. The Operator straps
them in and the chair begins to rise.

The height is about 240 feet now and the wind is beginning
to blow the chair around a little. Hooker is struggling to
maintain his cool.

Snyder has long since learned to let cracks like that roll
off his back. He feigns casualness, but is ready to move
at the slightest hint that Hooker is going to flee. Hooker,
on the other hand, is finely attuned to any sign that Snyder
may attack. Hooker's bicarbonate is brought to him by the
fountain attendant.

then sprints out the door with Snyder in close pursuit.

108 EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK PIER - NIGHT - ON HOOKER 108

racing down the amusement midway with Snyder at his heels,
both dodging the street vendors and the scattered people
still strolling the pier at this hour. Hooker makes for the
Fun House, leaping the turnstile much to the surprise of the
attendant. Snyder flashes his badge as he crashes through.

curt TO
109 INT. FUN HOUSE - NIGHT 109

Like most forties fun houses, this one consists of a series
of "obstacles" that one must pass through to get out. Once
you're in the progression, you have to go on. There's no
turning back. The obstacles are designed to be fun if taken
at a deliberate speed. If you're in a hurry, the place can
be treacherous. Neither Hooker nor Snyder are deliberating.

110 FUN HOUSE ENTRANCE TUNNEL 110

The first obstacle is a revolving drum just inside the
entrance tunnel. It's difficult enough to walk through.
But Hooker tries to take it at a dead run. He's thrown
down violently and tumbles several times, Snyder is able
to grab him for an instant, but is immediately thrown off
his feet too.

lll ANGLE 111

The two men grapple fiercely, tumbling head over heels,
banging off the walls, flailing at each other with arms and
legs. Neither is able to establish dominance because of
the constant revolving of the drum. Hooker finally kicks
himself free and scrambles out on hands and knees. Both
men have taken a terrible beating. .

112 ANOTHER TUNNEL IN THE FUN HOUSE 112

Hooker jumps to his feet and heads into another tunnel, this
one pitch dark. Still the two go as fast as they can, in an
effort to gain ground, crashing from side to side, tripping
on things, knocking over the laughing clowns and roaring
devils that pop out at them. :

#00406 67

AT A FOUR-LANE SLIDE IN THE FUN HOUSE 113

Hooker emerges from the tunnel at the top of a four-lane
slide. Usually one negotiates the slide by sitting on a
burlap sack. Hooker disdains the sack, flinging himself
down the slope head first. Both are getting skin burns to
go with the bruises they got in the barrel. Neither man is
having fun in this house.

IN THE FUN HOUSE ~- AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE 114

Hooker has his choice of the "Slanted House" or the "Mirror
Maze." A good mirror maze is truly a confounding expersence.
People have been known to get lost in them for upwards of

an hour.

IN THE FUN HOUSE ~ MIRROR MAZE 115

Snyder charges in after Hooker, and is brought to a quick
stop by the sight of sixteen different images of himself.
The pace of the chase now changes completely.

Snyder makes his way slowly through the maze, painstakingly
trying to discern the real path from all the reflected ones.
Every once in a while an image of Hooker will flash across
several mirrors, but Snyder has no idea which one to chase.
It's quiet now, the only sound, the labored breathing of the
two men. Hooker finally calls to Snyder from another part

Q e maze.

HOOKER
You never shoulda followed me in
here, Snyder. I've been through
this maze a hundred times.

-SNYDER
It don't matter what you do, Hooker.
I'm not leavin' Atlantic City with-
out you.

. HOOKER |
Guess I might as well give up then.

Suddenly, Hooker appears rig t off Snyder's left shoulder.

He cocks his arm for a punch, but Snyder catches him out of
the corner of his eye, whirls around, and smashes a mighty
blow to Hooker's gut. Or what he thought was Hooker. Un-
fortunately, it's just another mirror image. Hooker, because
of his experience in this maze, knew just where to stand to
create a single reflection. Snyder's punch splinters the
mirror to bits and opens a nasty cut on his head.

Snyder is an enraged bull now. Several images of Hooker
begin to appear in the mirrors. Snyder goes after all of
them, wildly clubbing them with his pistol butt, kicking
them with his boots, shattering mirror after mirror in a
frantic attempt to destroy the real Hooker. Finally all the
images of Hooker disappear, and Snyder hears his footsteps
receding rapidly in the distance. He knows by the time he
finds his way out, Hooker will be long gone. He looks back
at the trail of destruction he's left and then slumps back
against the wall in exhaustion. We hold a beat and:

Hooker searches quickly through some records and finds some-

the turntable and drops the needle. He moves a couple chairs
out of the way to make more room as the intro starts.
Veronica can't believe this. :

ANOTHER ANGLE 121

The beat comes up and Hooker and Veronica launch into the
most knock-down, killer-diller lindy jitterbug we have ever
seen, featuring all the great "air steps" and acrobatics the
early forties could muster. Veronica executes an amazing
series of twirls, kicks and jumps that come within inches of
taking Hooker's head off. Hooker, on the other hand, is a
great power dancer, whipping Veronica around like a top,
throwing her over his back, around ‘his shoulders and under
his legs. They're both dancing fluidly: but with a certain
savagery -- each one trying to outdo the other, each one
trying to push the dance into steps that the other can't
follow. It's a slam-bang two minutes. The Soul Train All-
Starts got nothin' on this.

The record ends and the dance finishes in a draw. Both Hooker
and Veronica maintain their nonchalance, like it was a walk

in the park, each trying hard to disguise the fact that they're
gasping for breath. Hooker chugs the last of his beer and :
picks up his hat.

That's too long. Hooker drops his arms and stops punching.

GONDORFF ‘
C'mon, you'll never get in shape
that way.

HOOKER

What difference does it make? I'm
gonna be down anyway.

GONDORFF
Yeah, but you gotta make it look good.
Macalinski’s gonna know somethin's
wrong if you fast go out there and
get pulverized.

Suddenly Eirie comes rushing into the gym.

Macalinski just drove up outside.

GONDORFF .
Okay, everybody, let's get movin’!

Immediately all the previously inert confidence men spring to
their feet and begin the various rigors of training. Some
work the speed bags and heavy bags, some get rubdowns, others
shadowbox. The Tuxedo Kid takes up a position next to
Gondorff, dressed in a gaudy, checkered sport coat. We

know this disguise is causing him great pain.

GONDORFF

rounds with Hooker. And Ohio....

Hooker and The Big Ohio quickly put on their protective head-

ee of the bodyguards, He surveys the scene a second and

then spots Hooker sparring in the ring. He comes over to
watch, standing a couple feet behind Gondorff and the Tuxedo
Kid, who pretend not to know he's there.

Up in the ring, Hooker is punching The Big Ohio all over the
lot, The Big Ohio, of course, exaggerating the impact of
every blow. Finally Hooker delivers a left hook, and The
Big Ohio, in a tour de force of acrobatics, flips over the
ropes and clean out of the ring. Gondorff calls Hooker and
pretends to be furious with hin.

GONDORFF

What the hell do ya think you're
doin'? I told you not to show that
left hook. What if some sports-
writer had seen that? You think
they'd ever believe you could lose
to Dann Kelley on the square with
a left hook like that?

, _ HOOKER
I'm sorry. I just forget my self.

None of this has been lost on Macalinski's ears. The Big Ohio
meanwhile, is staggering to his feet.

THE BIG OHIO
(dazed)
Sorry Berrigan, I've had enough.
GONDORFF

Yeah, all right.

(shouting up

to Hooker) .
Bobby, that's enough for a while.

Hooker climbs out of the ring and winks as he walks past
Macalinski. Gondorff turns around and for the first time
is face to face with Macalinski.

Well, I'll leave ya to tend to all

GONDORFF

Macalinski suppresses the urge to strangle Gondorff, and
leaves the gym with his guard dogs. On the way out, he

MACALINSKI
Does he know you're supposed to dump
the fight?

HOOKER

Hell, yes. He builds up a big bunch
a bets on me and he and Berrigan split
the take. Berrigan gets it comin' and

one line story that says Bobby Florian
went on his butt when Danny Kelley
breathed on him too hard. Berrigan
takes it on the lam to the Bahamas and
I wind up sellin' pencils. I tell ya,

What would you rather have, tuber-
culosis?

Savitt is pretty sure he'd rather not have tuberculosis. He
begins to do a little shadowboxing as does Hooker on the
other side. Even as he dances, Savitt begins to shake his
head a little, as if to clear it. Gondorff decides it's time
start. He claps his hands and the two fighters come out.

Hooker immediately begins dancing away from Savitt, realizing
that Savitt is getting groggy. Savitt stalks him and whips
out a few combinations, but Hooker is staying so far away
that they do no damage.

SAVITT
What's the matter, you scare of me,
Florian?

_ HOOKER
Just wanna give my legs some work
before I put you away.

Hooker continues to back away as Savitt stalks him all over
the ring. Macalinski doesn't like what he's seeing.

c'mon, Florian, fight, for chrissake.

Savitt decides he's had enough of this, too. He backs Hooker
into a corner and comes in to finish him off. Unfortunately
the methyl chloride is really getting to him now. He: throws

two wild haymakers which miss Hooker by a foot. Savitt is
shaking his head and blinking his eyes now. He looks ready

to fall asleep. Realizing his opportunity, Hooker steps
inside and smashes the right to Savitt's stomach. Savitt
doubles up, although he was probably getting ready to fall
down anyway. Then Hooker cranks up and unleashes his hardest
right to Savitt's chin. Savitt goes down and out like a light.

Macalinski is amazed. He comes up to Hooker as he starts to
untie his gloves.

_. MACALINSKI .
Nice work, kid. I didn't know you
had that kinda power. Get your-
self a shower and we'll go.

HOOKER _
Don't need a shower. Didn't even
work up a sweat. I'll just get the
gloves off and be right out.

As Hooker goes off to the dressing room, Gondorff comes over
to Macalinski.

and I ain't never seen a guy with a
punch like that. Where'd you find

Macalinski isn't talking. He just smiles and walks away.

Once they're all outside, Gondorff turns to all the gang with

a more than satisfied smile.

As she stumbles forward, he rears back and blasts her in the
face, knocking her all the way across the room and over a

Hooker's doing much the same thing Veronica has been doing,
only in accordance with his tastes, he's drinking beer and
listening to something a little more upbeat. Something like

Hooker gets a knock on his door. Unlike Vernoica, he immedi-

Veronica asks this question with real concern. She's not
being coy. Hooker leans forward and kisses her tenderly on
all the bruised areas of her face. He doesn't like her just
fine. Veronica is not at all upset by this response.

As before, Hooker tries to dance away from the combinations

and dodge the haymakers, but he can't avoid them all and his

face is turning puffy and red. Soon the cut is open again

Hooker's in trouble as he's slowing down and Kelly is scoring

legs too tired to move him.

ANOTHER ANGLE - IN THE RING 198

Even his flurry tactics don't slow Kelley, who wades in and
unleashes another barrage. Hooker can do nothing but try and
weather it. He gives up all pretense to offense. It's purely
a matter of survival now.

IN THE RING - THE FIGHT 209

Hooker comes out, and much to Kelley's surprise, doesn't back
away. Hooker throws a right-left combination and actually
lands one. Kelley counters with another swarm of blows, but
Hooker stands his ground and comes ripping back. He smashes
a right to the chest, a left to the ribs and an overhand right
to the head. The fight is becoming a real slugfest. Kelley
headhunting, throwing big haymakers, hooks and uppercuts.
Hooker duc ing inside, jolting shots to the ribs and mid-
section. Kelley's blows are more spectacularly visible from
even the cheap seats, but Hooker is dishing it out to the
body and Kelley is beginning to feel it. Hooker gains more
and more confidence, if nothing else than for the fact he's
still on his feet, It's turning into a helluva fight, and
the crowd is warming to it. All of them expect Lonnegan.

LONNEGAN

IN THE RING 211

Hooker and Kelley are literally toe to toe now, trading
punches as fast as their arms can work. One thing is be-
coming increasingly clear, however. Kelley is beg nmning to
tire.” He has trained too little and thrown enough punches
for three fights, and he's way behind on motivation. Hooker
senses it, and now his adrenalin really begins to flow.

He's taken Kelley's best shots and Kelly knows it.

Hooker rips a left to the stomach and follows with a right

to the side of the head. For the first time in the fight,

Kelley begins to backpeddle, looking for a little breathing
room.

stabs out with his right, but the zip is gone from his
punches. He tries to hold on, but Hooker pushes him away,
and starts pounding again.

Lonnegan is speechless. Floyd looks like he's growing

Hooker backs Kelley into a corner, Kelley's punches are just
awing the air now. Hooker, walking right through them, just
eeps ripping to the body, occasionally going to the head,

but mostly burning up the midsection. This is the first

round he's really thrown any punches, so unlike Kelley, he's
got something left despite the beating he's taken. Kelle

rops his guard to protect his aching ribs and Hooker rocks.

Eirie and The Big Ohio are going crazy in the corner. Birie
is filling the air with imagina punches in an effort to urge
Hooker on. He throws one so hard he falls down. Gondorff,

of course, has got to maintain his cool, having to preserve
the fiction that he's being double-crossed, but we know

that he's exploding inside.

IN THE RING 217
Hooker pummels away to the stomach again. Kelley's guard

comes down and Hooker straightens him up with a wicked upper-
cut that knocks Kelley's mouthpiece clean across the ring.
Kelley's arms are leaden. This time his guard stays down |

feet and blasts a right to the nose, a right-left to the jaw .

Kelley full on the chin. He wavers a second and pitches for-

Veronica.

Both Hooker and Eirie are stunned.

GONDORFF .
I sent her up to Chicago to get next
