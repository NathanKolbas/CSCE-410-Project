ANOTHER ANGLE:

Jack gets his motorcycle started and moves out to meet
Nick and Danny, For a moment, all three are aiming for
a head-on collision. Jack veers off to the right, Danny
veers off to the left. Unfortunately, Nick, in trying
to avoid Jack, goes in the same direction Jack is going
in. They narrowly miss hitting each other. Nick skids
around a field and finally drops his cycle and jumps
away from it. Jack manages to cut a wide arc and suddenly
realizes he's meeting Danny coming around from the other
direction. They pass each other with inches to spare,
both of them screaming at the top of their lungs. Nick
rolls around on the ground, laughing at the both of them,
in a helpless giggle. Finally Nick retrieves his motor-
cycle and moves down the road with Jack and Danny. :

As they travel, Nick's chuckling at their expense begins
to get under the skin of Danny and Jack. They trade
glances and move a little faster than Nick. Nick catches
up with them. They move a little faster. Before long
they're in an all out race.

When they get to the foot of the hill, they don't stop
there. But try to go all the way up the mountain. Nick,
with the more powerful machine is well in the lead, but
he hits a ditch and takes a spill.

Jack, concerned for him, doesn't watch where he's going
and plows into a large bush. He practically disappears
inside it. Danny, paying no attention to either of then,
chugs up the hill, till he gets to a plateau, stops his
motorbike, gets off and does. a victory dance. .

DANNY

Hah! I won! I'm victorious!

At the bottom of the hill, Kate and Anne are laughing as
Anne pours beer on Nick's skinned leg. Kate opens her
bag and removes a dozen items (bug spray, aspirin, etc.)
until she finds some antiseptic, which she sprays on
Nick's leg.

Jack ataggers out of the bushes and goes to Nick to see
if he's alright.

Across the fields, Claudia cups her hands to her mouth and
yells to Danny who is still doing his dance.
