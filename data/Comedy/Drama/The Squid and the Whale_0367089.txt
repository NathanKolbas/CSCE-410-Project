them sizzling soup.

MRS. GREENBERG
Walt, is there anything special you'd
like to order?

WALT
No, I’m just happy to have the same
amount of dishes as people. In my
family, it’s always one dish less the
number of people. That's our family
tradition, not ordering enough food.

MRS. GREENBERG
(laughing)
That’s funny. Oh, he’s funny, Sophie.

really wonderful. Have you met his

No. He talks about her with me,

He said you...he said you were upset.

JOAN
Yeah. I wanted to...I like him. You
know that. I just wanted to say...I

BERNARD
He called me right after. He said,

Oh...nope.
BERNARD

Actually, I have an extra room in my

And you wouldn’t have to blow your
super.

Bernard serves the ball off the table.

WALT
We're not allowed soda.

LILI
I guess there’s two kinds of parents,
those who allow soda and sugar cereal
and those who don’t.

We hear a “I can’t believe this shit!” from the attic.
Lili wipes her hands with a paper towel and tosses it in
the garbage.

WALT
We're not supposed to use paper towels
to wipe our hands. The cloth is for
that.

LILI
You’ re cute.

WALT
Thanks.

She touches his head, a kind of a gentle caress, and
disappears into the other room. Walt goes into the garbage
and finds the paper towel. He stuffs it in his pocket.

Where you going?

WALT
The movies. And then to a party.
With Sophie. What are you going to

They all spill out into the street. Joan approaches Walt,
apprehensively. Ivan horses around with Frank.

JOAN
I thought we‘d all have dinner. Ivan
suggested Gage and Tollner. We could
celebrate my book and your song.

WALT
Nah, I'm gonna go with Dad.

JOAN

Well, your Dad and I talked about all
of us going.

WALT
I don’t want to do that. See ya.

JOAN
Ivan and I came to see your show,
don’t treat us that way.

WALT
(sarcastic)
Oh, thanks for coming to see my show.
How nice of you.

Joan grabs both of Walt’s arms and pulls him toward her.

JOAN
You think you hate me, but I know you
don’t.

Walt yanks free and starts to walk away. Over his
shoulder, he flips her the finger. Joan grabs his arm,
whips him around and slaps him across the face.

Frank is startled, but sneaks out a smile. Other students
and parents watch this. Walt looks at her stunned and
humiliated. After a beat, he turns and walks away toward
Bernard and Lili, passing a kid who says to another kid:
“That's a Floyd song”.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 101
Bernard, Walt, Sophie and Lili look at their menus.

SOPHIE
Where did you come up with some of
those lyrics?

BERNARD
They were very dreamlike. Reminds me
of my second novel, End of The Line.
There's a rock star character in that.

LILI
I love that novel.
WALT *
A classic. The scenes with the baby *
in the middle are based on me as a *
baby. *
BERNARD *
That’s right. It’s Mailer’s favorite *
of my books. *
LILI *
And I loved your wife’s piece in the *
*

New Yorker.

BERNARD
Really? In The New Yorker?
(to Walt)

Did you know about that?

WALT
I guess I did.

BERNARD
How'd that happen?

LILI
It’s an excerpt.

WALT
She’s getting a novel published.

BERNARD
Really?

Bernard's face starts to drain of color.

SOPHIE
Walt showed it to me. It was kind of
sad, but really good.

Silence at the table. Bernard turns to his menu.

BERNARD
The portions are very big here, you
only need a half order.

WALT
Okay.

Walt and Lili meet eyes.
102 EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 102

Bernard still looks, disturbed as he hands his ticket to the
ATTENDENT. Walt stands with him, Lili and Sophie smoke in
the background, talking.

BERNARD
Jesus, fifteen dollars for parking.

WALT
What do you think I should do about
Sophie?

BERNARD
You'll make the right decision. I regret
sometimes I wasn’t more of a free agent when
I was younger. There was a woman who
approached me at a party at George
Plimpton’s after my first book. She was
very sexy. I could’ve gone home with her.

WALT
Why didn’t you?

BERNARD
I was with your mother.

WALT
Oh, right, of course. You should've
probably done it. It didn’t stop her.

They both soak in this remark.

BERNARD
Well, maybe you should sleep with her
once and see if you like it. It
doesn’t mean you can’t see other women
too.

WALT
(looking over at the girls)
I don’t know if Sophie will go for
that.

BERNARD
Well...after your performance tonight,
things might change for you.

WALT *
Don’t you think the first girl you
sleep with should be perfect?

BERNARD *
You’ve never made love with one of
your girlfriends?

WALT
No. I’ve done other things. I’ve
never really had many girlfriends.
This is the first one, really.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT 103

Walt and Sophie walk together.

SOPHIE
Should we go to my house? I thought
we could--

WALT
Jesus, you really want to do it, don’t
you.

SOPHIE
(embarrassed)
I don’t know.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

WALT
What's the obsession with sex?

SOPHIE
It’s not an obsession. I’m not so
sure I want to do it either. I'm
scared too.

WALT
Scared is not the issue. It’s just
that everything is so serious
suddenly. We're not getting married.
You’re going to Italy anyway for the
summer and then to college. I
just...we’re young, we shouldn’t tie
each other down.

SOPHIE
What are you saying?

WALT
Nothing, it’s just I don’t want to
feel pressure from you.

SOPHIE
Do you like someone else? Your Dad's
girlfriend?

WALT
No...why...no! And she’s not his
girlfriend.

SOPHIE

(she holds back tears)
My father said you have a weak
handshake which is a sign of
indecision.

WALT
(defensive)
His hands are so huge, I can’t get a
good grip.

SOPHIE
And my mother said that you don’t have
a very good model for relationships
because of your parents.

WALT
What? Your mother doesn’t know
anything.
(thrown)
I thought it went well. You told me
she said I was hilarious.

She bursts into tears. Walt stands there, completely
unprepared for her reaction. She just gets worse and
worse, crying harder and harder.

WALT (CONT'D)
Stop it. Sophie. Stop it. Don't be
difficult. Please.

Her crying stops. She looks at Walt, Silence.

SOPHIE
I’m not being difficult.

INT. LILI’'S ROOM - NIGHT 104

Walt sits on the bed next to Lili who’s in shorts,
crosslegged. He looks depressed.

LILI
You want a beer?

She rises and grabs two from a little fridge which is
stocked with stuff.

LILI (CONT'D)
I couldn’t take relying on your Dad’s
shopping habits anymore. You can have
anything you want whenever.

WALT
Thanks.

LILI
I’m going to read you a draft of my
new story. I want your thoughts <
first. Then I’m gonna show it to your
Dad.

Lili lights up a cigarette.

LILI (CONT'D)
You like Pink Floyd, huh?

WALT
What?

Walt tenses up, but she smiles warmly, indicating it’s
okay.

LILI
Don’t worry, I used to hand in Lou
Reed lyrics in my poetry class and
pass them off as my own. Although I
hope you don’t get caught. I always
did.

She touches his arm. He and she lock eyes for a moment.
Walt bows his head, his eyes on her bare thigh. The crease
in her knee. He focuses in on this. The silence seems to
go on forever.

LILI (CONT'D)
Do you--?

Walt nervously swings his head up, clocking her in the
nose.

LILI (CONT'D)
Oww! Fuck.

WALT
Sorry!

Her nose is bleeding.

WALT (CONT'D)
Lili, sorry.

She gets up and looks in the mirror.

LILI
Shit. S’okay. Just a bloody nose.

WALT
I‘m sorry.

She goes into the bathroom. A moment. She comes out, her
head tilted back, tissues soaking up the blood.

LILI
I think I might take a bath. Okay?

WALT
Oh... .okay.

A pause. He realizes he’s supposed to go.

WALT (CONT'D)

Okay...
LILI
Night.
He leaves the room.

EXT. JOAN’S HOUSE - MORNING 106

Joan and Ivan pack up Ivan’s car. Frank stands on the
stoop.

JOAN
When’s Bernard coming to get you?

FRANK
In an hour.

JOAN
Plan on thirty minutes. He’s always
early to get you. And late to bring

you back.
FRANK

I wish I could come with you guys.
IVAN

I heard that, brother.
JOAN

I know. But Dad's got you on

Saturday.

(pause)

Do you like his girlfriend?

FRANK
Is she his girlfriend?

JOAN
I thought so. She lives with you. He
doesn’t say?

FRANK
No. I think Walt loves her.
JOAN
So, they like the same women now too.
FRANK
What?

FRANK
You too, brother.

Frank watches, anxiously, as they start the car and drive
away.

INT. JOAN’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING 107

Frank waits at the window, looking out at the street.
Checks his watch, Goes to the phone and dials. Machine,

He waits and hangs up. Goes to the fridge and takes out a beer.
EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - MORNING 108

Bernard drives, Lili shotgun, Walt in back. Spirits are high.
EXT. BINGHAMPTON UNIVERSITY - DAY 110

Bernard, Walt and Lili are welcomed by JEB GELBER, who
wears a Sweater vest and bolo.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - DUSK lil

Bernard reads from Under Water at a podium. Not a well
attended event. Lili and Walt sit next to each other. His
arm brushes hers on the arm rest.

Bernard finishes. Applause. He grins. Gelber comes out

INT. JOAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 112

Tangerine Dream’s El theme from Risky Business plays on the

stereo, Frank, nude, drinking whiskey, stands at his *

mother’s dresser going through old photos and jewelry. He *

finds some condoms. Takes one out of its wrapper, looks at *

it, smells it. And puts it on his penis. He walks over to *

a mirror and looks at himself. The condom slips off his *

penis and lands on the floor. He retrieves it and tries to

put it back on. On the bed, we now see, he’s laid out his

mother’s underwear and bra and stockings on the comforter.

Leaning in to the mirror, he moves his nose around. Swigs

from his whiskey glass. Suddenly he doesn’t feel so great.

He spits on the floor. Waits. He vomits. He runs to the

bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 113

He throws up into the toilet. Tears stream down his face.

He rolls over onto the tile. A moment. He sneezes. He

looks into his hand and finds a cashew. CUT TO BLACK.

INT/EXT. FRANK’S SCHOOL - DAY 114

Bernard and Joan stare at MS. LEMON, Frank’s principal. *
BERNARD

This seems quite impossible.
Joan, stunned, says as if it’s happening to someone else:

JOAN
The poor boy.

MS. LEMON
I mean, masturbating is his own issue.
But Hector witnessed the locker
incident and then later semen was
found in the library...

BERNARD
Who’s Hector?

Ms. Lemon indicates a CUSTODIAN over to the side, who nods
politely.

BERNARD (CONT'D)

How do you know they were both
Frank's,

CONTINUED:

MS. LEMON
Well, I suppose it’s possible other
kids are masturbating and spreading
their semen around the school as
well...possible, yes, but also somewhat

unlikely.

BERNARD
Oh, it happens I'm sure much more than
we know.

JOAN
Bernard, have you ever done something
like this?

Bernard looks at Ms. Lemon, who nervously looks away, then
back at Joan. He says indignantly:

BERNARD
I’m not going to answer that.

MS. LEMON
Has anything been going on at home
that might’ve provoked this behavior?

JOAN
Well, Bernard left him behind for
three days last week.

BERNARD

(pause)
And, of course, Frank’s mother
divorced me earlier this year, which
might also have something to do with
it.

(suddenly, to Joan)
Did you tell Frank I’m unattractive?

JOAN
No. He just doesn’t want your bone
structure.
They all stare at each other uncomfortably.
EXT. FRANK’S SCHOOL - DAY 115
Ms. Lemon holds the front door for Bernard and Joan.
MS. LEMON
Ms. Berkman, I read your story in The

Bernard’s expression is completely blank. Bernard and Joan
start down the steps to the sidewalk.

JOAN (CONT'D)
You're living with a twenty year old.

BERNARD
It’s none of your business, Joan.
She’s older than twenty.

JOAN
It’s my business when you have our
kids. It’s confusing for them. Frank
says Walt’s in love with her.

BERNARD

(hesitates)
Walt has a girlfriend.

(suddenly angry)
Fuck off, Joan. I don’t ask about you
and Ivan. Stay out of my life. I
can’t believe you'd talk to me like
this. You left all those fucking
ticket stubs and letters lying around.
You wanted me to know. It was fucking
torture, Joan. Fucking torture.

Pink Floyd's version of “Hey You".

He walks to his car. He gets in, puts the key in the
ignition, but doesn’t turn it. He sinks down slightly in his
chair. .

INT. IVAN’S CAR - DAY 116

We FOLLOW Joan as she gets in. Frank sits in the passenger
seat, staring at the floor. She looks at him. Takes a
deep breath. Reaches over and touches his head.

INT. HIGHSCHOOL CLASSROOM - DUSK 117

Mr. Simic is now playing the Pink Floyd song for Bernard
and Joan on a tape deck. Bernard reads the liner notes.
They sit at desks across the aisle from each other and
listen in silence. Simic turns it off. Joan absent
mindedly peels skin off her lip.

BERNARD
He made his own interpretation.

MR. SIMIC
Well, he’s still going to have to give
the prize money back. But obviously
it’s a bigger problem. He isn’t doing
any of his school work either.

(CONTINUED)

BERNARD
His paper on Gatsby was quite
brilliant, I thought. It’s one of his
favorite books.

MR. SIMIC
That may be, but I don’t believe he’s
read it.
(pause)

You both should talk to him.

Bernard turns to Joan. She’s already looking at him. She
flicks some skin off her finger and says sadly:

JOAN
I think Bernard has to do it.

INT. WALT’S ROOM AT DAD'S - EVENING 118

Bernard stands in the doorway, Walt is on the floor with
his guitar in his lap.

BERNARD
He wants you to see a therapist.

WALT
I don’t need that.

BERNARD
That’s what I said. Does Simic know
both your parents have Ph.D.’s in
literature?

WALT
I’ve mentioned it.

BERNARD
T think he’s full of shit. These
public schools tend to hire well
meaning, but ultimately
unsophisticated bureaucrats.

WALT
Yeah. I don’t like him.

BERNARD
But you might have to do it. Just to
please the school.

WALT
I don't need it.

BERNARD
I know. And unfortunately probably a
guy with a BA in psychology. Not a real
shrink.
 

80.

119 INT. SCHOOL THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY 119

Walt sits across from the therapist, MR. WADDLES, 30’s, who
is already answering a question of Walt’s.

MR. WADDLES
I have an MA in Developmental
Psychology from the Yale Child Studies
Program.

WALT
Did you get a PhD?

MR. WADDLES
No, an MA is a masters.

WALT
Uh huh. Right.

MR. WADDLES
Do you have any thoughts about why
you're here, Walt?

WALT
Not really.

MR. WADDLES
Nothing?

WALT
No.

Waddles waits a moment, consults his notes.

MR. WADDLES
You said you wrote the song you played
in assembly. .

WALT
Uh huh.

MR. WADDLES
why?

WALT

I don’t know.

MR. WADDLES
Did you have a reason?

WALT
I felt I could've written it.

MR. WADDLES
Okay. But you didn’t. It was written
by Roger Waters of Pink Floyd. TI
think you know that.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Silence.

A silence

81.

WALT
Yes, but I felt I could've so the fact
that it was already written was kind
of a technicality.

MR. WADDLES
I see.
(pause)
I can imagine this is a little
uncomfortable for you to talk about.

WALT
I guess. It’s hard to explain.

MR. WADDLES
I wonder how you're feeling right now.

WALT
I don’t know.

MR. WADDLES
I’d like to know more about you. Why
don’t you tell me about something less
uncomfortable. A nice memory maybe.

WALT
Isn't that kind of a stock question
for a shrink?

MR. WADDLES
Yes, that’s more or less how this
works.
WALT
I can’t think of anything right now.
MR. WADDLES
Just think.
WALT

Come on...

MR. WADDLES
Just something. Meet me half way
here.

as Walt thinks.

WALT
Umm...let’s see...okay, when I was
around six, my Mom and I...she and I
ducked out of Julie Glynn’s birthday
party to watch “Robin Hood” together
on our TV.

(CONTINUED)
82.

MR. WADDLES
That sounds like a nice memory.

WALT
I liked Errol Flynn.

MR. WADDLES
Errol Flynn. That’s all?

WALT
And I was glad she let me leave the
party early to watch the movie. She
and I loved that movie. It's like...we
were pals then...we’d do things
together... we’d look at the knight
armor at the Met, The scary fish at
the Natural History Museum. I was
always afraid of the squid and whale
fighting. I can only look at it with
my hands in front of my face. When
we'd get home, after my bath, she’d go
through all the different things we saw
that day in the museum. And then we'd
get to the squid and whale and she’d
describe it for me which was still
scary, but less scary and it was fun.
It was fun to hear about it.

MR. WADDLES

Did your Dad live at home back then?
WALT

Yeah, why?
MR. WADDLES

You didn’t mention him. Where was he
during all of this?

WALT
He was...I don’t know exactly.
Downstairs maybe. He didn’t ever come
to the museum...This was...It was
before my brother was
born...before...it was earlier...

Walt stops for a moment, choked up. He looks at Waddles
with a surprised expression on his face. Waddles gives him
a “Not bad, eh?” shrug.

hears:
LILI’S VOICE
I’m not...not now, Bernard. I’m not
feeling like it.

BERNARD’S VOICE
Why not?

LILI’S VOICE
I'm just not, okay?

Walt peers in.
INT. LILI’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 121
Bernard has his hand up Lili’s shirt, kneading her breast.

BERNARD
Put me in your mouth.

Lili’s eyes meet Walt’s over Bernard’s shoulder.

WALT
Hi.

Bernard turns around to see his son. Walt just stares.

BERNARD
Hey, Walt.
WALT
Hi.
BERNARD
I'll be right there, we can...hang
out.

Walt leaves. Lili takes Bernard's hands off her.

LILI
I don’t want to do this anymore.

Lili walks to the other side of the cramped room. Bernard

says nothing, looking both hurt and angry. He walks past

her and down the stairs.

FRANK
Isn’t it Mom’s night?

Yeah, but I‘d like you to come over.

FRANK
Mmm mm.

Bernard looks at the bookshelf.

wrote.

Bernard turns to the ceiling high shelves full of books.
His eyes scan the titles. He finds the books with his name
on the spines. He can’t move. His face grows suddenly
emotional.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Dad, why are you taking me to your
house on Mom’s night?

BERNARD
Just a minute.

He stands there, motionless, soaking in the place. For a
brief moment, everything softens. His eyes grow watery.
He takes a deep breath. All the change of the last few
months seems to register. Joan enters from the kitchen.

JOAN
Oh...

BERNARD
Hi. Frank let me in. I didn’t
realize you were here.

JOAN
I’m here. It’s Monday.

BERNARD
I’d like to take him for just tonight.

I‘1l give you two Thursdays in a. row
or something.

FRANK
Mom...

JOAN
It’s my night. He wants to stay.

Bernard picks up a little toy soldier off an end table.
Inspects it.

JOAN (CONT'D)
Be careful, that’s an antique.

BERNARD
Where’s Walt?

JOAN
I don't know where Walt is.

He comes down the stairs and goes to the door.
EXT. HUNAN PALACE - DUSK 125

Walt looks in the window. His gaze goes from family to
family, sharing plates, kids trying to eat with chopsticks.
He finds Sophie and her parents at a table in the back. He
watches for a beat, She suddenly looks up and spots him.
He awkwardly ducks behind a menu that’s pasted to the
glass. He waits a moment and peers back out. She’s still
staring. He stares back too. Her parents turn and look at
him. A moment. Walt ducks back. He waits. He peeks back
out, but they’re not paying attention. He walks away.

EXT. PROSPECT PARK - DUSK 126

It's getting darker. Walt runs along the path. He
suddenly darts into the brush, pushing his way through the

“trees.

He emerges to a pond. No one is around. He walks toward
it and stops. He stares out over the water.

INT. BERNARD’S PEUGEOT/EXT. JOAN'S HOUSE - DUSK 127

Bernard sits in his car which is double parked. Starts it
up, changes his mind, and puts it in park. He sees Walt
running up the block. Walt, whose head is soaking wet,
doesn’t see Bernard watching.

Bernard waits for Walt to go inside Joan's, gets out of the
car and approaches the house. He wades through the front
garden and crouches down to the basement window. Inside,
Frank, shirtless, sits on his bed with a beer. Bernard
taps on the window. Frank looks up, startled.

INT. JOAN’S LIVING ROOM - DUSK 128

Walt walks in, his hair and face wet. Joan enters from the
kitchen. Her face lights up and she goes to hug him, but
backs off just before reaching him, afraid of scaring him
off.

JOAN
Chicken, what happened?
WALT
I dunked my head in that pond in the

park.

JOAN
The one near the zoo?

Sweety, that’s filthy. I hope you
didn't drink any of it.

Joan retrieves a towel from the bathroom and hands it to
Walt.

WALT
Some may have got in my mouth. I
tried not to swallow.
(pause)
I shouldn’t‘ve broken up with Sophie.

JOAN
Why did you?

WALT
I thought I could do better.

JOAN
Better how?

Walt gives this some thought. His answer comes as a
surprise to him.

WALT
I don’t know.

JOAN
That's good you miss her.

WALT
Yeah, but I don’t see myself as a
person who is in this situation. I
just don’t.
You know, I thought this could've been
a real thing. A real love affair. I
don’t see myself this way.

_ JOAN
Well, this is how it is.

WALT
Did you ever love Dad? Cause if you
didn’t, why did you ever marry him?
If you were going to leave him, why
did you put us all through this.

JOAN
It wasn’t planned. When we first met,
he was unlike anyone. In Columbus
there was no one like your Dad. We
were on the Ohio State campus and we'd
take our sdiW@Ridhes out to the green
and picnic together.

(CONTINUED)

He asked me who I preferred: Antonioni
or Fellini. I said Antonioni which was
the right answer, I guess, at the
time.

WALT
Is it Fellini now?

JOAN
I don’t know. I think it’s whoever
you like better.

They make eye contact for a second.

JOAN (CONT'D)
I had had an affair with a man before
your father. He worked in the college
bookstore. We used to make love in
the stock room. It got so that the
smell of text books made me think of
him.

WALT
Mom, I don’t want to hear about your
affairs, please.

JOAN
I’m sorry. I think I don’t know what
I can say to you.

WALT
You have a way of saying things
sometimes that are a way I don’t want
to hear them. Children shouldn't hear
these things from their Moms. You
should particularly watch it around
Frank.

JOAN
I know, chicken, it’s something I do.
It’s a bad habit.

WALT
Do you...do you remember when we
watched “Robin Hood”?

A moment, Joan jumps. Walt, startled, turns. Frank and
Bernard stand in the doorway.

Joan, let me ask you something. All
that work I did at the end of our
marriage, making dinners, cleaning up,
being more attentive. It never was
going to make a difference, was it?
You were leaving no matter what...

JOAN
You never made a dinner.

BERNARD
I made burgers the time you had
pneumonia.

JOAN
Only after I insisted!

BERNARD
Well, if I had made more dinners would
that've made a difference?

JOAN
I was ready to leave a long time ago.
I just didn’t know it then.

BERNARD
(hesitates)
I’ve been giving it some thought. I
mean, you called my father at the last
minute. You said something. Whatever
you said, he thought I could save the
marriage.

Bernard and Walt quickly meet eyes.

BERNARD (CONT'D)
You felt I wasn’t aggressive enough.
I’1ll make more of an effort to do
stuff. I’ve been cooking and doing
chores at my house. I make veal
cutlets which the boys love.

Frank looks at his father as if to say, “What are you
talking about?”

BERNARD (CONT'D)
Why don't we all have dinner and talk
more about this.

Joan starts to laugh. It catches her off guard. It’s
clearly out of her control. She tries to stop, she sucks
it in, but it erupts to a hysterical level. The two boys
and Bernard watch her as she continues to shake and laugh.
Nobody says anything. Finally it dies down. She wipes the
tears from her eyes. Coughs. She's exhausted.

JOAN
I‘m sorry... It’s
just...burgers...once,.

Joan loses it again, laughing, but struggles to control
herself. Bernard sighs, saddened by this. But as it sinks
in, he just grows angry.

BERNARD

I’1l sue you, Joan. You know I will.
You had an affair for four years with
that fucking shrink that ruined our
marriage and I can get the kids. I
talked to Eddie Goodman, who works on
these cases all the time and I have an
open and shut case.

(pause)
Frank, Walt, get in the car.

A pause.

JOAN
Sue me? That’s so...I can’t... You
only wanted joint custody cause you
pay less child support that way.
Because it was cheaper for you.

Joan stops herself. She pounds the top of the TV with her
fist, upset she said what she did. Walt looks at his Dad,
“Is this true?". Bernard goes to the front door and opens
it. Street noise enters the house.

BERNARD
Walt, Frank!
FRANK
I don’t want to go.
BERNARD
I don’t give a shit. Frank, get in

the car.
Frank doesn’t move.

BERNARD (CONT'D)
Frank!

Bernard grabs Frank's arm. Frank bursts into tears. Walt
steps between them.

WALT
Let him stay.

BERNARD
I’m just asking this one thing.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (5)

WALT
He wants to stay. Let him. I’1l go.

Frank and Walt meet eyes. Frank’s nose is running, tears
streaming down his face. Bernard turns to Walt.

BERNARD
Fine.

Frank and Walt stare at one another for an extended moment.

FRANK
Hold on...

Frank kneels down, picks up the CAT and hands him to Walt.

FRANK (CONT'D)
You want him tonight?

WALT
Okay. Thanks.

FRANK
That’s alright, my brother.

Bernard and Walt walk out the front door.
129 EXT. JOAN’S HOUSE - DUSK 129

Just as they step outside, the cat leaps out of Walt’s arms
and into the street. Joan screams.

JOAN
The cat!

It runs under a parked car. Bernard and Walt go after it,
surrounding the car, Bernard taking the street side and
Walt the curb. They both kneel down and look under the
vehicle. The cat mews from beneath it. Bernard reaches
under and grabs its tail. He and Walt meet eyes underneath
the car.

BERNARD
I got him. Joan, I got him! I got
him!
He turns to Joan and Frank who watch from the stoop. His
attention goes to a COP next to his double parked car,
writing a ticket.

BERNARD (CONT'D)
Goddammit !

Bernard releases the cat who darts down the block and out
of sight.

(CONTINUED)

WALT
Dad!

Bernard rises and starts toward the Cop.

BERNARD
I'm moving it!

A car SCREECHES on the breaks and swerves just avoiding
Bernard. The Cop looks up. The DRIVER yells, furious.

DRIVER
What’s your problem?

BERNARD
(under his breath)
Fuck off.

Ivan walks down the block toward them. He starts to pick
up the pace. Walt turns to Frank who has wandered closer.

WALT
Did you see him go?

Frank shakes his head, No and bursts into more tears.

JOAN
Frank, go inside. Where is he?

WALT
I don't know where he went.

Bernard reaches the Cop. His face red, he’s panting. The
Driver continues to shout at him. Ivan jogs over to the
scene.

IVAN
What's going on?

BERNARD
I had him.

Bernard’s breaths are audible, deep. He looks at the Cop.
The Driver curses. Ivan next to him. Joan and his kids. He
suddenly clutches his arm. And falls. Ivan drops to his
side.

IVAN
Bernard? Are you okay, man?
(pause)
Joan, call an ambulance!

Joan runs inside. Frank stares at Bernard. Walt races

over and kneels down to his father. Bernard squints at
Walt.

EXT, BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT 130

Bernard, awake, on a stretcher, is about to be loaded onto
the back of an ambulance. Joan and Frank wait on the
corner. Bernard says something to the PARAMEDICS and they
stop for a moment as Bernard waves for Joan to come over.
She approaches and leans down to him. He runs his thumb
over his lips and looks at her.

BERNARD
“Degeulasse”.

JOAN
What?

He starts to repeat the gesture, but stops self-
consciously.

BERNARD
It means, “Bitch”. Don’t you
remember?

JOAN
You're calling me a bitch?

BERNARD
No, don’t you remember the last line
in Godard’s *A Bout de Soufle”.
Belmondo calls Seberg a bitch.
“Degeulasse”. We saw it at the Thalia
with the Dicksteins. I got you in for
a children’s price. You were pregnant
with Walt.

JOAN
(long pause}
Like six weeks.

BERNARD
I still got you in for a children’s
ticket. You told me you didn’t like
Godard. You thought the jump cuts--

Bernard is suddenly thrust up in the air on the gurney and
rolled inside.

BERNARD (CONT'D)
I’d check for the cat behind the
asheans under the Golodner‘s stoop!

JOAN
Okay.

They meet eyes briefly. He gives a “Who would’ve thought”
kind of shrug. She nods. Ivan and Walt climb into the
back with Bernard and the door is shut.

The ambulance pulls away. Silence. Joan and Frank start
walking, surveying the block for the missing cat. Frank is a
bit stunned, his face smeared from crying.

FRANK

Do you think we'll find him?
JOAN

I hope so.
FRANK

Do you think one day we could go to
the Galapagos?

JOAN
I don’t know, Pickle.
(pause)
Ivan and I could take you to the
country on Saturday to see some real
turtles.

FRANK
Saturday's Dad’s day.

We see them from a distance, alone on an empty street.
INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT 131

The siren wails. Walt and Ivan sit in silence. Bernard is
sedated in the back, a paramedic at his side.

WALT

I didn’t write it.
IVAN

I know.
WALT

Pink Floyd did.

IVAN
It’s okay, brother.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 132
Walt. peers in. His Dad lies on a bed, looking pale and

thin, reading a detective novel. Bernard looks up, sees

Walt and smiles sheepishly.

BERNARD
There’s my son.

WALT
Hey. Are you okay?

BERNARD
I’m fine. Thought it was a
heartattack, but I think I’m just
exhausted. Doctor said I’m exhausted.

WALT
Too many veal cutlets?

BERNARD
(smiles)
Maybe.

WALT
Is that a good book?

BERNARD
Oh...this is pulp...it’s not serious...
it’s...you know it’s hard to read a
good book in the hospital. But this
isn’t bad of its kind. Leonard is the
filet of the crime genre.

Walt is silent.

BERNARD (CONT'D)
I'd like you to stay here for the day.
I need the company.

WALT
(pause)
Okay.

BERNARD
Lili moved out.

Bernard gives a “What can you do?” raise of his eyebrows,
Walt nods.

BERNARD (CONT'D)
Do me a favor, go out in the hall and
get me another pillow, my neck is
hurting.

Walt doesn’t move. Silence.
WALT
Dad, you know how for my birthday you

gave me Nikes.

BERNARD
What?

(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED: (2)

WALT
How you gave me my Nikes as a birthday
gift?

BERNARD
I wanted to get you something you could
use.

WALT

I know, but you know, since Mom gets
me winter coats and you get me
sneakers as part of your
divorce...anyway...

BERNARD
In our separation agreement, it says
I’m responsible for sneakers up to
fifty dollars, those Nikes were over
eighty.

WALT
Uh huh,

BERNARD
And I don’t think you told me anything
else specific that you wanted.

WALT
I know, I should’ve thought of some
things.

BERNARD

You actually get more presents now since
you get them from both your mother and
me. When we were together we gave them

jointly.
WALT

I know.
(flustered)

And I like the sneakers so it doesn’t
really matter. I’m not really angry
anymore. It's just...what bothers me
is you didn't...You didn’t try to...

He trails off. A moment as Bernard takes this in.

BERNARD
I got you the sneakers.

WALT
(takes a deep breath)
Maybe we could even things out a bit
and I could stay at Mom’s a few extra
days since I’ve been staying more at
yours...

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)

BERNARD
It’s not a good time right now, I’m
not going to be a hundred percent for
awhile. I’d like you around.

WALT
I don’t think I want to come for a
while.

BERNARD

It’s not up to you, Walt. You’re a
minor. You're in my custody. My home
is your home too.

WALT
I’m not coming.

BERNARD
Why?

Walt is about to say something. He doesn’t.

BERNARD (CONT'D)
That hurts my feelings.

Walt looks surprised.

BERNARD (CONT'D)
Don’t be difficult. If you like, we
can get you some more posters or make
your room better, paint it a different
color. I got Frank a turtle.
(indicating his blazer on the
back of the chair)
Look in the pocket of my jacket.

Walt walks over to the coat, he feels in the pockets.

removes a few little pieces of broken green clay.

BERNARD (CONT’D)
The guy said that was the best one.
It’s got a blue dot on it or something
that makes it worth more.

Walt holds it out to Bernard.
BERNARD (CONT’D)
Mmm. I guess it didn’t survive the
fall.
Walt looks at the shards and dust in his hand.

BERNARD (CONT‘D)
We won’t tell Frank.

WALT
No.

Tears suddenly stream down Walt’s face.

WALT (CONT'D)
He would've liked it.

BERNARD
I could lend you my first edition of
The Naked and The Dead.
(pause)
As a present.

WALT
Let me get you a pillow.

Walt goes out the door in the hallway. He pauses for a
moment, removes a pillow off a gurney and brings it back
into the room. Bernard awkwardly lifts his head and Walt
jams the pillow under his Dad’s neck. Bernard tries not to
look at his son's crying, he presses the nurse button a few
times, but doesn’t seem convinced it’s working. He finally
looks at Walt, moved himself. Bernard's voice cracks as he
says:

BERNARD
You used to be very emotional when you
were younger.

Walt nods.
BERNARD (CONT’D)
Did I look pretty silly out there,
falling on the concrete?
WALT
(pause)
Yeah.
Bernard bursts into laughter. Walt watches him curiously.

WALT (CONT'D)
What are you laughing at?

BERNARD
That was funny how you said, “Yeah”.
Good comic timing.

WALT
Thanks.

Bernard smiles at him warmly. He reaches out his hand.
Walt takes it. Bernard squeezes it. .

BERNARD
Why don’t we get some breakfast. See
if you can find the nurse out there.

Walt starts for the door.

Walt nods, turns and goes out the door.
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 133

Walt walks down the hall a bit. & Chinese NURSE
approaches. He stopa in front of her. She looks at him.
Silence. She waits for him to say something.

WALT
Excuse me. The man in that room wants
to order some breakfast

NURSE
Okay.

Walt watches her disappear into Bernard’s room. Pause. He
walks in the other direction. We FOLLOW him as he passes a
blonde Italian-looking nurse, goes by Ivan in the waiting
room, reaches the elevatore, presses the button, He goes
for the stairs.

INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 134

He jogs down the stairs, clutching the rail.

EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING 135

And now he’s outside. Morning rush. A crowded sidewalk.
He walks briskly for a bit. Turns a corner, keeps going.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - MORNING 136

He walks, head down. He looks up. The Museum of Natural
History, It’s just opening for the day.

INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - MOMENTS LATER 137

Walt enters the room with the big whale hanging from the
ceiling. He looks at the dioramas. Finding the one with
the squid and the whale he mentioned to the shrink earlier.
He approaches it a bit warily. It’s dark and scary. He
gazes into the black, finding the squid and then the whale.
We STAY on his face as he takes this in. Very slowly, he
leans his head against the glass. And rests.
