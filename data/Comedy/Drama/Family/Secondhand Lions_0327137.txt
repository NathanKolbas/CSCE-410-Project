INT. OPEN COCKPIT BIPLANE - FLYING - DAY 1

OLD MEN
YA-HOOOO! ! !

Wearing goggles and helmets, two old men SCREAM like crazy
kids as their SPUTTERING biplane loops and rolls.
EXT. BENEATH A SHADY HIGHWAY UNDERPASS - DAY 2

A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY naps inside his police cruiser.
Suddenly, his radar WAILS: it flashes "120".

ROAR! The biplane BLASTS past, upside down, the old men
HOLLER and wave. The cop SCREECHES off after the biplane
lights and SIREN BLAZING.

INT. OPEN COCKPIT BIPLANE - FLYING - DAY 3
Upside down, the old men CACKLE as the police cruiser

quickly, impotently falls away below.

EXT. LOW, ON THE GROUND - SUNSET 4
The plane flies away, barely under control: it careens

and SPUTTERS off into a huge heroic sunset.

INT. CLUTTERED ARTIST'S STUDIO - DAY 5

A phone RINGS. A hand sketches: a whimsical lion peers
out of a cornfield. The ARTIST picks up the phone:

ARTIST (into phone)
Hello?

TELEPHONE (V.0.)
Walter Caldwell...? I have bad
news. It's about your two uncles...
INT. MODERN-ERA CAR - MOVING - DAY 6

He drives past a lonely landscape. A distant voice ECHOES:

MAE (V.0.)
Walter...? Walter...?!
WHITE Revision - 8/25/02

INT. BEAT-UP MID-50'S CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY

MATCH DISSOLVE: a boy, WALTER stares out at the same
landscape. He is pale, quiet: one of life's wallflowers.
The clothes, the car, the road signs, the RADIO MUSIC...
all say the time is now the early 1960's.

His mother, MAE, drives; she is far deeper into her
desperate thirties than she will ever admit.

MAE
Walter! Good news! You're spending
the summer with your two uncles....

Walter CHOKES, lunges for the window and hangs out it
THROWING-UP. Mae scowls, fires up a long cigarette.

MAE (Cont'd)
It'll only be a few weeks, a month
or two, tops. I'll definitely
come get you before school starts.

Walter turns from the window and sits, pale.

WALTER
That's what you said at that summer
camp. And the time with the nuns.
And before that...

MAE
Walter! Look! I promise this
time. Scout's honor. OK...?
Cross-my-heart-hope-to-die! OK?

Walter still isn't buying it. Mae SIGHS.

MAE (Cont'd)
Walter: someday you're gonna have
to learn to trust people. Or you'll
grow up bitter and disappointed.

He looks bitter and disappointed right now.

WALTER
Where you going this time?

MAE
"The Fort Worth College of Court
Reporting". I met a guy last night,
he's pulling some strings. Court
Reporters have their pick of good
jobs, and their pick of good husband
material: lawyers, judges, cops...

Walter thinks; DISSOLVE TO:
WHITE Revision - 8/25/02

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - A COURTROOM

Dreamlike, a quick jump into Walter's head: in an imagined
courtroom, Mae busily court-reports, avoiding the admiring
smiles of respectable LAWYERS, COPS, THE JUDGE...

...and returns the lewd grin of a slimy CONVICT in chains.

BACK TO SCENE
Walter SIGHS, glumly looks back out the window.

MAE
You'll have fun with your uncles.
You'll see.

WALTER
Mom. You're an only child.
(off her look: )
I know what uncles are.

Mae colors slightly, exhales hard, a blast of smoke.

MAE
Well Mr. Smarty-pants, they really
are your uncles: your great uncles
my mother's brothers. They disap-
peared forty years ago and just
now showed up back here in Texas.

WALTER
Can't I come with you?

MAE
No! I'm gonna be working my little
tail off learning Court Reporting!
I'm doing everything I can to keep
this family together, Walter. How
about some help here?! OK?

He nods, retreats back into his silence.

MAE (Cont'd)
Now look. They say these two old
men got millions stashed away, in
cash. They got no kids, nobody to
leave all that money to. And me
and you, why, we're as close as
any family they got...

WALT
You want them to like me so they'll
die and leave us their money?

MAE
We could settle down, maybe buy a
house: wouldn't that be nice...?

(Walter looks wistful)

But watch out for other relatives.
You wouldn't believe all the crooks,
backstabbers and thieves we have
in this family...

 

Walter nods soberly. Mae turns the Cadillac onto a dirt
road; it's flanked by a huge terrifying sign: "NO
TRESPASSING! Violators will DISAPPEAR!" Walter GASPS.

MAE (Cont'd)
This is it! Oh, look at your face.

She TSK-TSKS, SPITS in a Kleenex, rubs it over his face,
as his big eyes follow more alarming signs: "DANGER!
EXPLOSIVES!" "KEEP OUT! WEAPONS TESTING RANGE!"

MAE (Cont'd)
By the way: I hear these two were
in some state nuthouse for forty
years, and got all their money
from a big lawsuit or something...

Walter GULPS. More signs: "LOOSE RABID ATTACK DOGS!"
"NUCLEAR RADIATION! PERSONNEL IN PROTECTIVE SUITS ONLY!"

WALTER
Maybe we should'a called first....

MAE
Naa! Older people just love
surprises.... Here we are!

The Cadillac pulls up; Walter looks out, GULPS:

EXT. THE UNCLES' HOME/COMPOUND - DAY 10

A ramshackle home: a tower leans crookedly. Beyond, a
wide, blue lake fades into the horizon. Motley chickens
loiter around an old barn. An old truck rusts silently.

Dogs HOWL: a pack of ugly stray dogs races up and SLAMS
into the car, HOWLING, WAILING, teeth SNAPPING.

MAE
Show them you're friendly. Let
them smell your hand.

Walter thinks not. The dogs are joined by a large
SQUEALING hog, another member of the dog pack. Then
GUNSHOTS: the dogs race off. More GUNSHOTS and YELLS.

MAE (Cont'd)
Sounds like they're down by that
lake. Come on.

EXT. SHORE OF THE LAKE - DAY 11
In shallow water, a catfish swims. The water EXPLODES.

Standing out in the lake, wearing big hip-waders, HUB and
GARTH fire shotguns down into the water. KA-BOOM!

HUB
Where'd it go?

GARTH
There! Between your feet!

HUB
Ha! Winged him!

GARTH
He's running for it!

Both BLAST AWAY at the frantic fish: BAM-BAM-BAM! CLICK

GARTH (Cont'd)
Damn! Empty!

HUB
You get ammo! I'll cover him!

MAE (0.S.)
Yoo hoo!

Startled, both look up: at the shoreline, Mae waves.

HUB
(to Garth, disgusted)
You sent for a hooker?

MAE
Uncle Hub! Uncle Garth! It's me!
Mae! Your niece! Pearl's daughter
And I brought Walter! Your nephew!

Behind her, Walter peers out timidly. The two men CURSE:

GARTH
Relatives!

HUB
Damn it!

EXT. UNCLE'S HOME BACK PORCH - DAY 12
The wet angry men storm up, pursued by the wheedling Mae.

HUB
We're old, dammit! Leave us alone

GARTH
Last thing we need is some little
Sissy-boy hanging around all summer

The furious men storm inside. Mae smiles at her son.

MAE
Walter honey? Why don't you stay
out here and play.

She goes in; Walter sits, hears the ARGUMENT CONTINUE:

MAE (0.S.) (Cont'd)
He can help out here! Do chores!

HUB (0.S.)
Help out? Look at him: the kid's
a damn weenie!

MAE (0.S.)
That's why he needs to be around
real men! Like you two!

Walter SIGHS. A shadow covers him: the pig glares right
in Walter's face, eyeball to eyeball, almost... hungrily.

WALTER
Good boy. Nice doggie! Go play.

The pig GROWLS, a pretty-fair dog imitation.
WALTER (Cont'd)
Mom. ..?
EXT. UNCLES HOME/BY THE CADILLAC - DAY 13

Mae STARTS THE ENGINE. Beside the car, Walter stands
miserable, shoulders slumped, a shoddy bag at his feet.

MAE
This is for your own good, Walter...
You know, I bet all that money's
hidden real close-by. Imagine!
Real buried treasure, like in those
books you're always reading!

Walter's misery remains impregnable. Mae gives up.

MAE (Cont'd)
Walter: maybe if you'd smile once
in a while, then people might like
you.

 

He sees two hostile uncles staring, arms crossed, furious.

MAE (Cont'd)
Now. Give me a big smile to
remember you by.

Walter tries: it's more of a grimace than a grin.

MAE (Cont'd)
You're gonna have to work on that
smile while I'm gone. OK?

Walter nods solemnly. Mae blows a kiss and motors off.
Morose, Walter watches the dogs chase the Cadillac away.

Walter picks up his bag, turns, looks up at the brothers:
OK, now what? Finally:

GARTH
Well. Supper time.

INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE - DAY 14

Walter watches the uncles wolf down fish, steak, sausage.
The dogs and the pig crowd to look in a porch window.

Walter stares down at huge portions of shot-up fish, steak
and sausage. He tries the fish, bites something hard,
SPITS a shotgun pellet out onto his plate: PLINK. SIGH.

He hacks off a chunk of steak, chews with all his strength.

WALTER
This steak is... weird.

HUB
Venison! Not steak!

Walter frowns, decides to try the sausage: not bad.

HUB (Cont'd)
Pork!

 

GARTH
We raise our own pigs.

Walter freezes mid-bite, looks at the window: now the pig
glares even more murderously at him, and GROWLS. Then,
Hub suddenly SLAMS his fist down on the table.

HUB
Know what I hate about houseguests?
This! Dinner table chit-chat!
Acting so damn nice and polite!

GARTH
Hell Hub! Then just be yourself!

Hub glares at Walter: well? Walter GULPS, nods, agrees.
Dinner resumes, in SILENCE. Walter eats and tries to
ignore the pig's now-murderous stare.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATE DAY 15

The uncles sit, sipping huge glasses of what may be iced
tea; beside them, two shotguns stand ready, close at hand.

Sitting on the porch steps, Walter wonders: they seem to
be waiting for something... Finally, he SIGHS.

WALTER
If my mom calls, can we hear the
phone out here?

GARTH
Don't have one.

WALTER
No telephone?

Walter thinks about that.

WALTER (Cont'd)
OK if I watch television?

GARTH
Ain't got one.

WALTER
No television? What do you do?

Dizzy, Walter wonders if he's fallen off the edge of the
planet. GRAVEL CRUNCHES: a car approaches.

Both men lean forward, PUMP their shotguns. Below, a
SMILING SALESMAN alights from his car.

SALESMAN
Gentlemen! Word is out you two
are sophisticated men of means.
Do you worry about the future? Of
course you do! That's why I, a
representative of the Mississippi
Mutual Insurance Company...

BLAM-BLAM! Hub and Garth fire BLASTS just over the
salesman's head. Walter YELPS, ducks. The Salesman
SHRIEKS, jumps in his car, SCREECHES off. The dogs HOWL
and chase the car away.

Walter shivers, stunned; he stares as the brothers calmly
sit back down, drink, and reload.

WALTER
There's plenty of entertainment on
TV. Educational stuff too! It's
a good thing to do in the evenings!

GRAVEL CRUNCHES again. The brothers raise their shotguns.
A GRINNING SALESMAN appears:

GRINNING SALESMAN
Rumor has it you two got millions
stashed away! Why not put that
money to work for you with the
high return only investing in gold
and silver can bring....

BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! Another salesman flees for his life.
The brothers sip reflectively, and reload.

WALTER
Everybody loves TV! You oughta
get one! You'd like it! Really!

The brothers consider that. Gravel CRUNCHES: A BEAMING
SALESMAN opens his trunk: a display of kitchen gadgets.
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The salesman hightails it away.
Finally, Hub turns to Walter, and says definitively:

HUB
No TV.

The brothers sit back reflectively.

GARTH
Nice evening... Peaceful.
INT. STAIRS LEADING UP - NIGHT 16

Walter gingerly cradles a lit lantern and his bag; he
stares up at narrow, steep stairs, winding up out of sight.

GARTH
You sleep up there... the tower

It sounds so ominous. Walter GULPS, nods, inches upstairs.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Hey! We don't know nothing about
kids. If you need something....

HUB
Find it yourself! Better yet
learn to do without!

GARTH
We're both gettin' old...

HUB
...and fixin' to die any minute!
If we kick off in the middle of
the night, you're on your own.

Eyes huge, Walter stares at them, his imagination whirls:

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE KITCHEN 17
In his p.j.s, Walter comes in for breakfast, YAWNS, calmly

sits at the table beside two clothed skeletons, the former
Hub and Garth. Walter nonchalantly MUNCHES his Cheerios.

BACK TO SCENE - WITH WALTER ON THE STAIRS 18
Walter flinches, nods; he continues up the steep steps.

HUB
Jumpy little feller.

GARTH
Mmmm. Quiet though....

INT. WALTER'S TOWER ROOM - NIGHT 19

Walter staggers in, looks around... the tower room is
heaped with debris, trunks, chests, suitcases, junk.

He opens his bag, takes out a toothbrush, sees a small
door by the stairs: a bathroom? He opens the door
something tumbles over him: an old Santa Claus costume.

He tries on the beard, admires his reflection in a murky
mirror. Then, he hears: downstairs, two snoring-world-
champions WARBLE and hit every SNORING-note Man can hear.
He SIGHS, BRUSHES his teeth, further explores the room:

One trunk is covered with exotic travel stickers. He
fingers the big padlock. Locked. Walter looks crushed.

He crawls into bed; as he leans out to blow out the candle
he grabs a big knob on the headboard... the knob comes
off in his hand, he tumbles onto the floor

Walter stares at the knob in his hand: a key falls out.
Walter looks at the key, then at the locked trunk. He
tries the key in the lock. CLICK: it fits. Slowly, he
opens the lid: CREAK... empty. No money, no jewels, only:

WALTER
Sand...?

 

Puzzled, he runs his fingers through sand that covers the
trunk bottom. Enchanted, he SNIFFS a handful: it smells
exotic. MUSIC ECHOES, evocative, Arabic perhaps.

Beneath the sand he sees something, picks it up: it's a
faded photo of the most beautiful woman he's ever seen;
dark hair, olive skin, piercing eyes. Walter wonders.

BANG! A door SLAMS. Walter leaps to the window, looks
out: below, Hub strides purposefully out of the house
carrying a toilet plunger; he disappears into darkness.

Walter runs out of the room, leaps down the stairs.

EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 20

Walter bursts out the front door, runs after Hub.

EXT. THE LAKE SHORE - NIGHT 21

Walter arrives at the lake, looks around: no one there.
It's spooky. A NOISE: startled, Walter turns... Hub
looms over him, the toilet plunger raised in attack.

WALTER
Aaaagh!

Walter cowers. But Hub stumbles on past, down towards
the water. Walter stares: Hub now stands at the shore,
waiting; silently, the dogs and pig all join walter.

WALTER (Cont'd)
He's sleep-walking!

The dogs lay down, eyes fixed on Hub. Watching. Waiting.

Hub smiles, a cold smile. Then, with a CRY, he swings
his plunger like a sword and begins to fight: parry,
thrust, savage overhead cut... Walter watches, eyes wide;
from far away, he hears echoes of SWORDS CLANGING,
HOOFBEATS, WHINNIES, CRIES OF MEN IN BATTLE.

Walter and the animals watch the thrilling moonlit battle

at the water's edge. MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THE LAKE SHORE - DAWN 22

Morning. Walter, the dogs, and the pig all sleep curled
up together. Walter stirs, sits up, looks around:

The lakeshore is deserted, Hub is gone. Walter wonders:
was it all a dream?

A rooster CROWS. Frantic, he runs toward the house.

EXT. BACK PORCH/REAR DOOR INTO KITCHEN - MORNING 23

Walter skulks up, looks in: at the table, Garth works on
huge stacks of mail. Garth stands, walks out.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 24

Walter sneaks in, starts for the stairs... but the stacks
of mail are too intriguing. He thumbs through the mail:

It's all coupon responses from magazines and mail order
catalogs; all have "Please have a salesman call" checked
or written in. Walter GASPS, shocked. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.
Walter panics, tries to look innocent, as Garth enters.

GARTH
Thought you'd run away.

Walter shakes his head "no". Garth hurriedly gathers up
the mail, puts it away. Then, Garth CRACKS eggs into a
huge frying pan full of SIZZLING sausage.

 

Walter sits, confused. Finally, he just has to ask:

WALTER
Y-y-you send mail to all those
salesmen? You ask them to come
here so you can shoot at them?

GARTH
(sighs, finally nods)
Don't tell Hub. It'd take all the
fun out, ruin it for him.
Walter looks even more confused. Garth stirs the eggs.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Every man needs a hobby.

Walter considers that. Hub enters, rubbing his shoulder.

HUB
Brand new mattress. And I'm still
waking up tired and sore.

Garth smiles knowingly, then sees Walter staring at Hub.
Garth wonders, dishes out eggs and sausage.

Walter eats, then freezes, he's being watched: in the
window, the pig now has an angry rooster perched on its
head; now two animals glare murderously at him. SIGH.

WALTER
So... you two disappeared for
forty whole years? Where were

you?
The brothers chew reflectively. Finally....

GARTH
Africa, mostly.

WALTER
Africa? Where in Africa?

GARTH
North Africa. Morocco, Algeria,
Kenya, the Sudan....

HUB
...but that was long ago, and we're
old and worthless now!

All eat. Silence. Walter tries again.

WALTER
Still, I bet you two sure got lotsa
good stories to tell, huh...?

HUB
Stories! Ain't nothing sadder
than a couple'a has-beens jabbering
about the "good old days". Those
days are through, and so are we!

All eat in silence. Long pause.

GARTH
I don't know how a feller can
concentrate on eating with all
this talk-talk-talk.

For just a second, Walter thinks he sees a twinkle in
Garth's eye. Then, it's gone.
WHITE Revision - 8/25/02 14.

EXT. THE GARDEN - DAY 25

The uncles and the boy hack at hard Texas earth, the start
of an ambitious garden. Walter struggles with a too-large
hoe. The dogs and pig watch, puzzled.

HUB
I_ hate this!

GARTH
We're retired. Gardening is what
retired people do.

HUB
Why the hell do we want any damn
vegetables, anyway?

GARTH
They're good for you. Make you
live to be a hundred.

HUB
To hell with that!

He throws down his hoe, storms off.

GARTH
Getting old's bad enough! Getting
pissed-off about it don't help!

Walter absorbs this. A horn HONKS: a car drives up, across
the new garden rows: loud relatives pile out, all talking
at once: RALPH; HELEN; MARTHA, 13; and TWO WILD BOYS, 9.

ALL (all talk)
Uncle Garth! Where's Uncle Hub?
Kids, say hello to Uncle Garth!

CHILDREN
Hello Uncle Garth!

ADULTS (all talk)
We're here for a nice long visit,
the whole weekend! We know how
lonely our favorite uncles get!

Garth CURSES, throws down his hoe, STORMS off. The loving
smiles instantly disappear: all turn and glare at walter.

RALPH
Who are you?

WALTER
W-W-Walter.

Walter nods. The others look confused. Helen explains:

HELEN (Cont'd)
Pearl's daughter. That loose widow-
woman, always "running around".

RALPH
Figures she'd try to muscle in.

HELEN
Is Mae here?
(Walter shakes his head)
How long are you here for?
(he shrugs, who knows?)
Well! We'll just see about that!

She storms off. SCREECH! The kids fly in all directions.
The dogpack YELPS, scatters. Ralph glares at Walter

RALPH
We know what you're up to. And
you're not getting away with it.

He stalks off. Walter thinks. Then he throws down his
hoe and walks toward the house.

26 EXT. BACK PORCH/REAR DOOR INTO KITCHEN - DAY 26
Walter reaches the door, starts to go in, but hears:

HELEN (0.S.)

Men at your age! Taking in that
strange little boy! He's probably
robbing you blind!

Inside, Walter sees Hub and Helen ARGUING, toe to toe.
HELEN (Cont'd)
If you want young people around
you're welcome to any of mine!
They're very well behaved!
Walter hears a SQUEAL behind him, turns: the two wild
boys ride the terrorized pig, BAWLING Indian war-whoops.
Walter rolls his eyes, looks back inside:

You'll be stuck with him!

WALTER - AT THE REAR SCREEN DOOR 28

Walter, miserable, backs away. He slinks off.

EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - DAY 29

Martha sits reading, sees Walter staring at her. She
raises a haughty eyebrow: "Well?" On the spot, he BABBLES:

WALTER
I read a lot of books too.

MARTHA
Oooh. I'm so impressed.

He peers at her book: "Horses". He starts to speak...

MARTHA (Cont'd)
Yes: horses. Daddy says when my
uncles die I can have a pony.

Walter blinks, scrambles to think of another opener.

WALTER
Uncle Hub and Uncle Garth told how
they used to live in Africa.

MARTHA
They're big fat liars. That's
what Daddy says. He should know.
He's a lawyer.

 

 

WALTER
But, but...! Then where were they
for forty years? Where'd they get
all their money?

MARTHA
They robbed banks.

The famous Santa Claus Bandits.

Walter GASPS, shaken. Dazed, he slowly goes inside.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY 30

HELEN
Take him to the county boy's home!
They know how to handle
troublemakers like him!

GARTH
If his momma doesn't show back up
soon, we may have to...

HUB
If we're lucky, we won't live that
long!

Walter slinks in. Hub and Helen stand toe-to-toe.
HELEN
I'm telling you: take him to the
orphanage right this minute!
HUB
Whether we take him to the orphanage
or tie him up and throw him in the
lake, it's our business, not yours!
Walter GASPS: all turn, see him standing there, wide-eyed.

RALPH
Here he is now! Spying!

Ralph roughly grabs Walter: Walter panics, kicks out and
SMACKS Ralph's knee hard; Ralph YELPS, Walter bolts away.
EXT. HIGH OVERLOOKING THE HOUSE - DAY 31

Walter races out the front door and down the driveway; he
streaks toward the road, running away as fast as he can.

A RECEPTIONIST puts on her hat and coat to leave; but one
last CALL COMES IN. She SIGHS, answers.

Oh, well, try Mae Carter....

Uh... no, I'm sorry...
WALTER

How about Mabel Cartwright? Mame
Callaway? Donna Tomko?

RECEPTIONIST
Young man, are you in some kind of

She's gotta be there! She just

Walter panics, hangs up. As darkness falls, a small figure
sits on the gas station's low front step and buries his
head in his knees.
EXT. RALPH'S NEW 1962 BUICK - NIGHT 34

A new 1962 Buick pulls up to a stop sign with three unhappy
men inside, out looking for Walter. Hub GRINDS the gears.

RALPH
Ouch! Hub! I don't know why you
have to drive, it's my car....

HUB
Stop whining!

Hub GRINDS the gears again. Ralph glowers.
RALPH
When we find him, that kid's gonna

Down a ways, Garth sees the gas station... and Walter.

There he is....

Walter studies a piece of paper.
The Buick pulls in, runs over the air hose: DING-DING.
Walter looks up, goes back to studying his paper

Walter studies his paper. Garth sits on the curb beside
Walter, motions for Hub to sit. Hub scowls, but sits.

They look at Walter's paper, a page ripped from a phone
book: it's the area code map of the United States.

GARTH
Planning your next move?

Walter nods. Studies his map.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Where you figure on going?

WALTER
Here. Area code 406... Montana.
GARTH
Why Montana?
WALTER
Their license plates say "Big Sky
Country".

Hub and Garth nod. It's a good choice. Pause.

HUB
Family...!
GARTH

hat Hub means is: sometimes, family
an be a real pain in the butt.

Walter's lower-lip quivers, he hides his face in his knees.
The two brothers look awkward.

GARTH (Cont'd)
How come you aren't heading to Ft.
Worth, where your momma is?

 

WALTER
She's not there. She lied. Again

Hub and Garth exchange troubled looks: uh oh.

GARTH
You got a father somewhere?

WALTER
Mom says he died. World War Two.

Hub and Garth exchange "wait a minute" looks.

GARTH
Kid. That war was over twenty
years ago!

WALTER

Yeah, she's not good with numbers.
He probably just took off before I
was old enough to remember.

GARTH
Look kid. We know you got your
heart set on Montana, but it's
late... Hub, help me out here.

HUB
Why? Sounds like his mind's made
up. Good luck in Montana, kid!

Hub stands to go; Garth yanks him back down.
GARTH
We got better maps than that one,
back at the house. Right Hub?
HUB
A man needs a good map, that's for
sure....
All nod: all agree on the importance of good maps.
WALTER
I've been in the orphan home before.
I don't wanna go back
HUB
Dammit kid! It ain't our fault
you got a lousy damn mother!
Hub is puzzled why Garth now glares furiously at him.

HUB (Cont'd)
What?!

Walter stands. Consults his map, orients himself.

WALTER
I should get going. Which way is

Hub points. Garth shoves Hub's hand down, glares at him.
Ralph angrily HONKS his horn. Hub notes it:

HUB
I'll say one thing for this kid:
he sure pisses off the relatives.

That gives Garth an idea, an inspired idea:

GARTH
Look kid: do us a favor! If you
come back to the house and stay
awhile, why, our relatives will
hate it! In fact, I bet they'll
hate it so much they'll go away
and leave us all the hell alone!

 

HUB
It's so crazy, it just might work!

GARTH
So kid. C'mon! Help us out here!

Walter hesitates. Hub frowns at his watch.
HUB
Make up your mind! We got salesmen
back home, waitin' on us!
WALTER
Oh. Guess I could come back, for
awhile. Seeing it's so important...

All stand and nod agreement, as if they've just concluded
a deal. Hub and Garth walk Walter back to the car
EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY 38

The relatives sit beaming at Hub and Garth with phony
smiles: they're still here. Hub looks over at Walter:

HUB
So, kid! How's that root beer?

Walter sips a huge root beer, nods: it's good. Then, he
blinks: the relatives now glare murderously at him. Hub
and Garth lean back, satisfied: "The Plan" is working.

Helen gives Ralph a "go on" sign. He clears his throat:

Uncle Hub, Uncle Garth, this has

I hate to bring this up: but did
you two look at those wills I left
you?

Hub and Garth shake their heads, and SPIT.

RALPH (Cont'd)
It's best to be prepared...

GARTH
We ain't planning on dying any
time soon.

HUB

Speak for yourself!

RALPH
You both need to be thinking about
these things, at your age.

GRAVEL CRUNCHES: a car pulls up. A salesman. Hub and
Garth smile, jack rounds into their shotguns: KA-CHUNK KA-

Helen SHRIEKS. Walter covers his ears.

Below, this SMART SALESMAN leaps out and quickly crouches
down behind his car, safe behind cover

HUB
Damn!

 

GARTH
He's been here before....

SMART SALESMAN (0.S.)
Don't shoot!

Safe behind his car, the salesman waves a white flag.

GARTH
This is no ordinary salesman...!

HUB
I like a challenge.

Walter tugs at Hub's shirt; Hub wheels around, SNAPS:
HUB (Cont'd)

WHAT? !
WALTER

W-W-Why not see what he's selling?
HUB

What the hell for?
WALTER

M-M-Maybe it's something you want!

To b-b-buy!

Hub and Garth exchange flabbergasted looks: it's never
occurred to them. This greatly upsets the relatives:

HELEN
Your uncles know better than to
squander their money like that

Helen yanks Walter away, but Walter still calls out:

WALTER
But what good is having all that
money if you never spend any?
(relatives look alarmed)
It's no good to you after you're
gone!

Ralph's hands reach for Walter's neck. The uncles think:

GARTH
Could be, the kid has a point...!

HUB
We'll see what the man's selling...
then we shoot him.

GARTH
Good plan!

Both lower their shotguns and amble toward the salesman.
Relatives GROAN. Walter breaks away and follows.
WHITE Revision - 8/25/02 25.

39 THE SALESMAN BESIDE HIS CAR 39
The wary, sweaty Salesman sees the brothers approach.

SMART SALESMAN
Gentlemen! After our previous
unsettling encounters, I've searched
the world over for the perfect
item for two exuberant sportsmen
such as yourselves. And I've found
it!

He pops open his trunk, removes a large contraption.

SMART SALESMAN (Cont'd)
Voila!

WALTER
What is it?

SMART SALESMAN
The sport of kings! Up to now,
only Heads of State could afford a
fine piece of equipment like this.
And it's simple enough this child
can operate it!

WALTER
Really?

SMART SALESMAN
My boy, just press this button...

Walter presses a button: a powerful arm flings a clay
pigeon skyward. The salesman grabs a shotgun out of his
trunk, swings it up, and KA-POW! He blasts the clay
pigeon. Hub and Garth GASP: it's Love At First Sight.

WALTER
wow!

SMART SALESMAN
The most powerful machine on the
market! And very reasonably priced!

The relatives all scowl and BABBLE:
HELEN
Why, that's the biggest waste of
money I've ever...!

HUB
Then LEAVE!

Garth pulls out a huge money-wad, peels off big bills.
Helen fumes, storms off; her furious family follows.

As Garth counts out money, the Salesman nearly faints:
the once-in-a-lifetime moment every salesman dreams of.

The relatives drive away: all glare daggers at Walter.

SUMMER MONTAGE - THE FRONT PORCH - NEXT DAY 40
EVOCATIVE MUSIC PLAYS. Walter stares, stunned, at the

front porch heaped with cases of targets and ammo.

SUMMER MONTAGE - LAKE SHORE - THE SKEET SHOOTING MACHINE 41

Walter, with make-shift hearing protection, loads up the
skeet machine, pulls the handle. CLANG!

Clay pigeons WHOOSH out over the lake. Hub and Garth

BLAST away, never miss.

SUMMER MONTAGE - A SEED SALESMAN 42
Walter watches Garth select a variety of colorful seed

packets from a SEED SALESMAN. Nearby, Hub scowls.

SUMMER MONTAGE - THE GARDEN 43
The uncles and Walter finish planting and admire their
handiwork. Hub pulls out his pouch of chewing tobacco,

gets a plug; he holds the pouch out to Garth, who takes

some. Without thinking, Hub then holds it out to Walter.
Walter anxiously peers deep into the tobacco pouch.

Bravely, he takes the smallest possible piece, puts it in

his mouth, chews... and SWALLOWS.

Hub a pained look of "How could you?" Hub scowls.

SUMMER MONTAGE - THE GARDEN 44
A sprout has just broken the soil. Beyond, Walter lies

on the ground, stares at it, amazed. The MUSIC ENDS.

EXT. THE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT 45

The house is dark, except for a light high up in the tower.

INT. THE TOWER - NIGHT 46

Walter sits in bed, stares at the evocative picture of
the mysterious beautiful woman. The ARABIC THEME PLAYS.

A door SLAMS downstairs. Walter jumps up, looks out:
Garth walks toward the barn. Walter runs downstairs.

INT. DOOR INTO THE BARN - NIGHT 47

Walter peers in: Garth pushes aside hay bales, reveals...
a trapdoor in the floor. Garth descends into the ground.

Walter GASPS: frightened, but fascinated. He skulks up
near the hole, peers down... he hears GARTH CLIMBING BACK
UP. He leaps into a pile of hay, burrows deep inside.

Garth emerges, counting a big wad of cash. He pushes hay
bales back into place and leaves. Beat.

WALT (0.S.)
Ahhh-choo!

Inside the haystack, two eyes open wide with wonder.

INT. THE HIDING PLACE UNDER THE BARN - NIGHT 48

A flashlight CLICKS on, Walter GASPS: the room is heaped
with canvas money bags. Bank bags. Loose bills lay
scattered everywhere. Walter inspects one bag's lettering:
"First Bank of New York". Suddenly: ARF! ARF!

Startled, Walter looks up: above, the dogs and pig stare
down at him curiously.

Oh! You scared me!

Yeah. Me too.

Walter thinks. He comes to a decision.

WALTER (Cont'd)
There's something we gotta do.

EXT. BY THE LAKE - LATE NIGHT 49

The dogs and pig watch Walter dig a hole. Walter picks
up: the Santa Claus costume.

WALTER
If the cops find this Santa Claus
costume, the uncles go to jail and
we're all homeless.

The dogs seem to understand. The pig SNIFFS the costume,
allows Walter to bury it. Walter TAMPS down the covered
hole. There. Then, the dogs BARK, run off.

Curious, Walter follows, sees: at the lake's edge, Hub
stands looking far out over the water. It's eerie.

WALTER (Cont'd)
U-u-uncle Hub?

No answer. Walter shivers, finally reaches out to Hub...
but a hand grabs him, Walter YELPS: it's Garth.

GARTH
Don't. I tried to wake him once,
he nearly took my head off. Let's
give him a few minutes....
(realizes)
What are you doing out this late?

Walter shrugs innocently. They sit on a rise, overlooking
the lake. Hub stands there, motionless. The wind BLOWS.

WALTER
What's wrong with him?
GARTH
Well... A man's body grows old,

but inside, his spirit can be as
young and restless as ever. And
him... in his day, he had more
spirit than twenty men.

Garth SIGHS sadly... and finally nods.

WALTER (Cont'd)
What? What's he looking for?

GARTH
He's looking for her.

WALTER
Who? What was her name?

Long pause. Finally, Garth answers.

GARTH
Jasmine.

Walter wonders, eyes wide, remembering the photo he found.

WALTER
OK! Tell me.

The dogs and pig gather closer, as if to listen themselves.
GARTH

You want me to tell the story?
Now? It'll take days....

WALTER
There's no TV: what else have we
got to do?

GARTH

Much of it's second, third hand.
Rumors, really. I wasn't there
for some of it, and Hub damn sure
won't talk about it.

Walter nods and waits, eyes pleading. Garth SIGHS.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Well. My brother was always too
restless for Texas. So he convinced
our folks he needed to go to Europe.
And that I needed to come along.
That was the summer of 1914.

A STEAMSHIP WHISTLE BLOWS. Walter's mind whirls:

YOUNG HUB AND GARTH, both late teens, leave a ship and
enter an exotic French port, full of colorful characters.

GARTH (0.S.)
Unfortunately, just as we arrived
in France, so did the Kaiser and
the entire German army.

They see headlines: "Germany Invades!"

GARTH (Cont'd)
I wanted to go home, but Hub said
we'd tour Europe one step ahead of
the Germans. So we did. What a
time that was! I remember these
girls from Toulon. Twins! We....

GARTH AND WALTER 51
Garth catches himself, COUGHS, skips that part.

GARTH
Anyway... eventually, we wound up
in Marseilles, with passage booked
on the last ship out of Europe,
leaving in the morning. My brother
decided we should spend our last
night enjoying the local nightlife.

A WILD BAR: full of CAN-CAN GIRLS, SAILORS, SOLDIERS.

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - A FIERCE TRENCH BATTLE - DAY 54

In a narrow front-line trench, Garth ducks: TWO ARABS on
horseback fly past just overhead. He leaps up, panics:

an ARAB HORSEMAN looms over him, sword high: Garth's a
goner. But then: Hub flies in, tackles the Arab, finishes
him, grins at his brother. Garth SIGHS, smiles his thanks.

GARTH
And, in four long years of fighting
all over North Africa, battling
Germans, Turks, and Arabs, nothing
ever did. He saved my life
countless times....

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - A FORTRESS PARAPET WALL - DAY 54A

TURKS with ladders attack a fortress wall: Garth tries to
fire, but his rifle's jammed... a huge TURK looms, sword
raised. Garth lamely fumbles for his sword... Hub flies
in, snatches up his rifle and SWINGS: arms flail as the
TURKS on the ladder fall away. Hub grins, hurries off.

GARTH
We fought in many battles, against
overwhelming odds, against countless
enemies, all fierce and worthy,
every one.

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - AN EPIC BATTLE - NIGHT 54B

Greatly outnumbered, Garth fights with swords on horseback.
A HUGE ARAB knocks Garth off his horse, he falls, can't
stand: his leg is broken. Helpless, Garth sees his
comrades fall: a line of ARABS, GERMANS, and TURKS overrun
the front line, SCREAMING... He's done for. But then:

out of the smoke, Hub gallops in, swings Garth up behind
him, they ride away, the last survivors of the epic battle.

He was promoted to Captain, me to
Lieutenant.

new North African governments to

put an end to the slave trade....

Horsemen top a hill: young Hub and his Bedouin GALLOP

Neither one of you got a lick of

Hub storms toward the house, shaking his head. Garth and
Walter exchange shrugs, stand, and follow.

EXT. THE UNCLES' MAILBOX - DAY 58

Walter's hand retrieves the mail, a lot of mail-order
catalogs. Then, Walter sees a letter from "Mae Caldwell".

Walter rips open the letter, reads....

MAE (V.0.)
"Dear Walter. How are you? Found
your uncles' money yet?"

"Here I am at school in Fort Worth
my nose to the Court Reporting
grindstone...."

Walter looks at the envelope, stares at the postmark
"Las Vegas, Nevada. America's Fun-Tier!" He crumbles

EXT. GARDEN - DAY 60

Hub, Garth, and Walter hoe: all three wear new bib-overalls
and straw hats. The plants are knee-high now, identical.

Walter watches Hub, fascinated: Hub attacks the ground as
if it was a fight to the death.

HUB
We need this much damn garden?

GARTH
Think how good all these vegetables
are gonna taste. Peas, beans
squash, tomatoes....

Walter scans the garden: it's all identical knee-high
green stalks, every plant just alike. He wonders...

WALTER
What's this row?

Garth glances at the row's seed packet on a stake.

GARTH
Beets.

WALTER
And what's this row?

GARTH
Cabbage.

Garth rows, unconcerned. Walter suspiciously compares
the beets and cabbages, back and forth: identical.

Now wait one damn minute! What's

Garth looks. The packet shows a big bushy plant of:

YANKING up seed packet stakes that don't match their rows.

HUB
Lettuce! Squash! Sweet potatoes!
Carrots! Bok Choi... Bok Choi?

paw darts out, just misses him. ROAR!

There. Now you can see out.

He looks in: the lion BELCHES contentedly. Walter goes.

The pig and dog rush up, stick their heads inside. ROAR!
All scatter, SQUEALING. From the crate: COUGH-COUGH-COUGH.

The lion stares out at the thick green jungle of leafy

stalks, just out of reach, with an urgent, primal longing.
JUNGLE DRUMS, JUNGLE SOUNDS ECHO.

EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - EVENING 65
Walter steps up and sits.

GARTH
You sure he can't get out?

WALTER
(nods)
She. It's a girl lion.

Hub frowns: it figures. He leans back, SIPS....

WALTER (Cont'd)
I named her "Jasmine".

Hub CHOKES, bolts upright, furious:
HUB
Dammit! Have you two been talking
about...?

Garth shrugs innocently. Hub glares at Walter: well?
WALTER
I-I-I got it out of a book of Fairy
Tales! It just seemed like a good
name! For a lion!
Hub storms inside, SLAMS the door.
GARTH
Thanks a lot! You trying to get
me killed?

Angry, Garth goes in. Walter wonders, SIGHS.

EXT. FEED STORE - DAY 66
Hub, Garth, and Walter follow a FEED STORE OWNER.

FEED STORE OWNER
Sorry it took awhile to come in.
In forty years I never had a call
for it. I wouldn'ta believed they
even made such a thing.

They join others, FARMERS mostly, staring down at a pallet
stacked with bags marked:

FARMER
"Purina Lion Chow". I'll be.

The farmers scratch their heads in wonder.
FEED STORE OWNER
If you'll wait a few minutes, my
boys will load you up.
Hub frowns, grabs a bag, throws it over his shoulder

HUB
Garth. Pay the man.

GARTH
Brother, be careful.

FEED STORE OWNER
Mr. McCann, those bags weigh fifty
pounds apiece....

Hub glares, stalks off. Even the farmers are impressed.
WHITE Revision - 8/25/02 42.

67 EXT. THE LOADING DOCK - DAY 67

Hub tosses the last of the bags into their old farm truck,
straightens his back. Garth and Walter watch, concerned.

HUB
There. If you two old ladies want
to get in now, we can go home.

Hub hops down off the dock... suddenly his eyes roll up
in his head: he collapses and he crumples to the ground.

GARTH
Hub!

68 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 68
Ignored by busy HOSPITAL PERSONNEL, Garth and Walter wait,
anxious: they closely watch a nearby open doorway where
hurried NURSES and DOCTORS rush in and out.

Walter trudges over to a water fountain.

69 WATER FOUNTAIN 69
Walter struggles to operate the water fountain.

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Psst! Little boy!

Walter sees a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN motion to him.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (Cont'd)
You're with those McCann brothers?
I know about them.
She motions him closer, lowers her voice:
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (Cont'd)
I_know... that they're ex-Mafia
hit-men, on the run with millions
they stole from Al Capone.

Uh huh. Excuse me.

GARTH

Why would a smart kid like you
want to hear hokey old stories?

WALTER
What else we got to do?

Walter waits expectantly. Finally, Garth SIGHS.

GARTH
OK, OK.... Now where was I?
71 WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE DESERT OASIS 71

Young Hub and his Bedouin again scatter slavetraders.

WALTER (0.S.)
"No one, slavetrader or Beduoin
alike, had ever seen anything like
him, this mad American who fought
like twenty men..."

GARTH (0.S.)
Oh yeah, right...

TIGHTEN on one particular veiled young WOMAN prisoner.

GARTH (0.S.) (Cont'd)
It just so happened that one women
Hub freed was a handmaiden to a
princess.

72 WALTER'S IMAGINATION - JASMINE'S PALACE 72

She is joyfully reunited with her mistress and HANDMAIDENS;
all wear veils. EUNUCHS stand guard.

GARTH
She told her mistress the story of
her rescue. Most of all, she told
her of the handsome heroic American.

The veiled PRINCESS's eyes sing and dance....
GARTH (Cont'd)
"I must meet this man," the Princess
said....

The women huddle together, GIGGLING. Plotting.

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE MEDITERRANEAN SHORE 73
Horse hoofs POUND the shoreline.

GARTH
One day, Hub rode his horse at
dawn, along the Mediterranean.

Young Hub rides his magnificent stallion, both horse and
rider at the peak of their youth, strength, and power.

GARTH (Cont'd)
When out of nowhere, there appeared
another rider who drew up alongside.

An Arab, face covered, turns to ride alongside.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Well! You know Hub. There was no
way he'd let any challenge pass.
It became a race....

The two ride at breathless speed, flat-out, neck and neck

GARTH (Cont'd)
Many considered Hub the finest
horseman in North Africa. He'd
never lost a horse race, not one.
But this rider stayed right with
him, neck and neck, as the race
went on and on. And on.

Hub looks at the mysterious rider in wonder

GARTH (Cont'd)
Then: a horse stumbled, the horses
collided, and both riders flew
into the sea. Hub leapt up, his
sword drawn, ready for anything.
So he thought. He wasn't ready at
all for what he saw next....

Hub pulls his sword, whirls... stares: the rider sits up
out of the sea, disguise gone, water streams from her
long black hair. She meets Hub's eyes, smiles, and LAUGHS.

GARTH (Cont'd)
She was the Princess. She was the
most beautiful woman he had ever
seen. She was....

WALTER (0.S.)
Jasmine!

She is, of course, the woman from the picture: Jasmine.
Hub laughs. And the two look into each other's eyes.

GARTH (0.S.)
Now most people don't believe in
such things nowadays: they say
it's something you only find in
stories. But when those two first
laid eyes on each other, it was
honest-to-god, no-kidding, sure-
enough, once-in-a-lifetime...
"Love At First Sight".

MUSIC SWELLS. The horses caper and court in the surf
behind the couple who have eyes only for each other.
WALTER 74

Walter listens blissfully; then his eyes focus, he realizes
Garth has finished. Walter becomes more and more bothered:

WALTER
Wait a minute. Where is she?

Garth looks at him, surprised. Walter talks in a rush.

WALTER (Cont'd)
If it was true love they would
have gotten married and lived
happily ever after and she'd be
right here with us now! Right?

A shadow of sadness sweeps across Garth's face.

GARTH
Aren't you jumping ahead of the
story?
WALTER
Well... OK. Keep going.
GARTH
Well... Things weren't easy for

them, back then: they were from
different worlds. She was from a
royal family, her father a Sultan.
But none of that mattered to them.
They arranged often, to meet....

GARTH (0.S.)
They made plans to run away
together. But there was one big
problem: she was promised to another
man, a powerful Sheik from a nearby
kingdom, an evil Sheik who wore a
patch over one eye.

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - AN OLD EVIL SHEIK

CLOSE-UP: An Arab whirls around and glares: the SHEIK
with one eye. An evil, brutal-looking, ugly old man.

GARTH (0.S.)
Surprisingly, despite his ruthless
ways, the evil Sheik was said to
be quite young and handsome....

WALTER

Walter jumps, startled. He rewinds his imagination:

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - A YOUNG EVIL SHEIK

An Arab whirls and glares, a different SHEIK: this Sheik's
young and handsome, but still one nasty customer. WIDEN,
REVEAL: in Jasmine's father's palace, the Sheik threatens

 

a kind-looking Sultan, JASMINE'S FATHER.

GARTH (0.S.)

The evil Sheik heard Jasmine loved
another: he threatened her father
to hand Jasmine over at once, for
their wedding to take place that
very night. Her father had no
choice. And so the evil Sheik
took Jasmine off to his kingdom
and locked her away in his harem.

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE EVIL SHEIK'S HAREM

Imprisoned in a fabulous harem, Jasmine SOBS. OTHER WIVES
try to comfort her, but Jasmine will have none of that.

GARTH
She told the other wives she'd
rather die than to be a wife to
the evil, heartless Sheik. She
hid away a knife, so that when the
Sheik came for her that night, she
could slit her own throat....

Why, he rescued her, of course...

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE EVIL SHEIK'S HAREM 81

Swords CLANG! Hub fights his way through the harem, past
WARRIORS and EUNUCHS; wives point him to an alcove where...

...knife poised, Jasmine is about to end her life. Hub
slashes the curtain aside. She is saved.

GARTH (0.S.)
As they galloped for the gates of
the city, there was only one
horseman brave enough to stand in
their way: the Sheik.

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - AT THE CITY GATES 82
On horseback, the Sheik waits ominously, sword drawn.

GARTH
It was a thrilling battle on
horseback, between two expert
swordsmen... but Hub drew first
blood, a mighty stroke that cut a
big long scar down the side of the
sheik's once-handsome face.

After a short but thrilling swordfight, Hub and Jasmine
race through the gates, toward the desert and freedom.

GARTH (Cont'd)
They galloped away, got married,
and lived together happily ever
after. The End.

THE HOSPITAL 83
Walter revels in the story's after-glow. But then....

WALTER
But wait! If they lived happily
ever after, she'd be here. So
where the heck is she?! Didn't
they have kids? Where are they?

Anxious, both turn to Hub's doorway. Suddenly, medical
supplies fly out of the room, SMASH against the wall.

HUB (0.S.)
Where the hell are my pants?!

Garth and Walter sit back and EXHALE, relieved.

CRASH: DOCTORS and NURSES spill out: Hub storms out, head
bandaged, wearing a hospital gown, carrying his clothes
trailing an I.V. bottle. He glares at Garth and walter

HUB (Cont'd)
Who brought me here? You two?

Garth and Walter shake their heads innocently.

INT. UNCLES' OLD FARM TRUCK - MOVING - DAY

The three ride along in silence: of course, Hub drives.

HUB
Hospitals! Lot of good they are!
GARTH

How would you know? You're never
in one long enough to find out!

Hub scowls; sweating, he squirms, tries to ease his back
pain. Garth and Walter see it, know it's getting worse.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Hey! You missed the turn!

HUB
Did not!

GARTH
Home is that way!

HUB
I want to go THIS way!

SLAP!: atop butcher paper, huge slabs of ribs, brisket,

and sausage are piled high by a SCRAWNY OLD WOMAN OWNER.

At a long bar-like counter, Walter, Hub, and Garth dig
in. Walter eats his barbecue, but he's all ears.

GARTH
Brother, someday you're going to
have to start acting your age.

HUB
What the hell does that mean?

GARTH
Your whole life, you've never been
afraid of anything. So what's

Hell no!

HUB
Being useless!

Pause. Finally Garth nods, he understands.

HUB (Cont'd)
Me and you, we shoulda died in the
last battle of the last war.

Unfortunately, we lived.

grins, embarrassed, his face smeared with grease.

WALTER
Good barbecue!

Bearing "Get Well" balloons, relatives peer into Hub's

Oh. I'm afraid he's gone....

The relatives try to hide joyful smirks and look somber

These days, nothing makes sense.
Nothing matters.

Through double screen-doors, a convertible SCREECHES UP
music BLARING. FOUR HOODS jump out: leather jackets

duck tails. They SLAM open both doors, swagger in, stare
around insolently as if they own the place.

Walter watches the old woman scurry into a door marked
"Ladies Room". SLAM. CLICK: she locks the door.

Three hoods help themselves to six-packs from a cooler
The leader, FRANKIE, sees the uncles, swaggers over.

FRANKIE
Hey! Old man! How's that barbecue?
Gimmie some!

HUB
Get lost, boy. We're busy here.

FRANKIE
What? What did you say?

Hub shakes his head, continues to Garth:

HUB
Here's a perfect example of what
I'm talking about. Since this boy
was suckling on his momma's teat
he's been given everything but
discipline. Now his idea of courage
and manhood is to get together
with a bunch of punk friends and
ride around irritating folks too
good-natured to put a stop to it.

Garth nods sadly. The punks are flabbergasted:
FRANKIE
What? Who do you think you are,
old man? Huh?
Frankie pushes Hub against the bar. Hub's eyes blaze.

Hub: he's just a dumb kid. Don't
kill him.
The punks LAUGH. Frankie takes a fighting stance.

Frankie swings... but Hub dodges easily. Hub grabs the
punk's throat, squeezes hard, lifts him off the ground.
Frankie GAGS. Hub's fierce eyes drill deep into the
startled, helpless punk's eyes. Hub GROWLS:

HUB

I'm Hub McCann. I've fought in

two world wars and countless smaller
ones on three continents. I've

led thousands of men into battle
with everything from horses and
swords to artillery and tanks.

I've seen the headwaters of the
Nile and tribes of natives no white
men had ever seen before. I've

won and lost a dozen fortunes
killed many men, and loved only

one woman with a passion a flea
like you could never begin to
understand. That's who I am.

Walter's huge eyes shine.

HUB (Cont'd)
Now. Go home... boy.

With one last patented-Hub-look, Hub tosses Frankie away.

HOOD # 1
You're the McCann brothers? We
know all about you!

HOOD # 2
Everybody in town says you're
escaped Nazi war criminals!

Walter rolls his eyes. Frankie pulls a switchblade: CLICK.

FRANKIE
Come on! We'll show this old
bastard who's tough.

The others pull knives: CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.

shotgun at the punks.

GARTH
OK, fine. You fight him...

...then I'll let you fight the
rest of 'em. OK?

Peeved, Hub knows better than to argue, nods angrily.
The hoods look confused. Garth points to Frankie.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Hey, you. Pick up that knife.

FRANKIE
Huh?

GARTH
Son, you need all the help you can
get.

Frankie snatches up his knife, crouches in front of Hub
and SWISHES the knife back and forth dramatically.

FRANKIE
Come on, old man!

HUB
You're holding the knife wrong.

FRANKIE
Huh?

When Frankie glances at his knife, Hub chops his arm, the
knife flies away, Hub elbows the hood hard in the face.

Garth turns to the other hoods, shakes his head:

GARTH
Sheesh. Oldest trick in the book

With a HOWL, Frankie rushes Hub, SLAMS into him, fists
flailing: The Fight Is On. The boy flails at Hub, lands
an occasional blow, but mostly just expends energy. Hub,
however, calmly and collectedly takes the young man apart.

HOODS
Frankie's losing!

GARTH
Then you three better get in there
and help him.

The other hoods charge in. And, for a minute, it appears
Hub is at a disadvantage.... But not for long.

Anxious, Walter joins Garth: Garth casually cleans his
fingernails with one of the hood's switchblades.

WALTER
How come you're not helping?

GARTH
My brother always hogs the bad
guys. He's selfish that way.

WALTER
But there's four of 'em...!

One hood SLAMS against the bar beside them, SLIDES to the
ground, unconscious.

WALTER (Cont'd)
...three of 'em! Couldn't you
both share?

 

GARTH
Naa. After forty years, I'm used
to it. Besides... right now, he

needs them worse than I do.

Hub fights, a grin on his face: he's having the most fun
he's had in years.

The lion COUGH-COUGHS, lazily stands, stretches. She

"Bye Uncle Hub! 'Bye Uncle Garth!

HELEN
Shut up! Get in the car!

The furious relatives drive away, for the very last time.
Finally, Walter leaves the cornfield: he gives up.

WALTER
She won't come out of the cornfield!

All watch: the lion paces, patrolling her corn-territory.

HUB

She thinks she's in the jungle....

(all realize he's right)
She's a zoo animal. This
cornfield's the closest thing to a
jungle she's ever seen.... The
jungle's in her blood. She knows
it's where she belongs.

The hoods shake their heads, amazed at all this. Far
off, jungle drumbeats ECHO, exotic birds CALL

GARTH
You boys hungry? Wanna stay for
supper?
The hoods shrug: why not? They follow Garth to the house.

FRANKIE
What are we having?

Garth peels the steak off Frankie's face.

GARTH
Meat. Lots of meat....

Hub nods; then, a rare sight: Hub smiles. Then, more
rare, Walter smiles, his first smile in a long, long time.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - EVENING 96

Walter and Garth sit, enjoying the evening. Down by the
hood's car, Hub intensely lectures to the young men. In
the cornfield the lion ROARS happily; COUGH-COUGH-COUGH

Garth expertly shuffles a deck of cards, with impressive
professional-gambler flourishes, deals a hand of solitaire.

WALTER
What's he saying to them?

GARTH
He's giving them his "What Every
Boy Needs to Know About Being a
Man" speech.

Below, Hub paces back and forth like Patton addressing
the troops. The hoods stand up straighter

GARTH (Cont'd)
A lot of men have heard that speech
over the years. A lot of men.

WALTER

Will he give the speech to me?
GARTH

Oh, I guarantee it... Assuming

he's still around, of course.
Walter nods, troubled at that.

WALTER
You didn't finish the story. About
Uncle Hub and Jasmine.

GARTH
Sure I did: "They got married and
lived happily ever after. The
End." Remember?

WALTER
But, what happened after that?
What happened to her?

ANGLES: Hub and Jasmine ride along a romantic beach.

GARTH (0.S.)
No two people were ever so happy,
so in love. It was perfect....
Except for one thing.

WALTER (0.S.)
The Sheik!

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE SHEIK'S PALACE 98
The Sheik rants and curses at his followers.

GARTH
Yes, the Sheik. He hated Hub for
stealing Jasmine and for scarring
his face. He put a price on Hub's
head: ten thousand pieces of gold
a fortune. Assassins came from
thousands of miles away....

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - A BUSY MARKETPLACE/BAZAAR 99

Hub and Jasmine shop: Hub leans down to smell spices... a
knife flies in and quivers just over his head.

TWO ASSASSINS with swords leap at them: Hub ducks, SLUGS
one; Jasmine throws red pepper in the other's face. He
COUGHS, blinded; Hub tosses him into a pile of melons.

GARTH
Many dangerous men tried to kill
Hub and get the fortune.

They turn a corner: THREE ASSASSINS rush them. The lovers
dart into a stall: Hub yanks out a tent pole, the awning
falls over the assassins, traps them.

As Hub and Jasmine exit the bazaar: FIVE MOUNTED ASSASSINS
DRAW SWORDS. The lovers run back into the crowd, hotly
pursued by five horsemen as they duck and dart through

the maze of merchant stalls...

Hub ducks: a SIXTH MOUNTED ASSASSIN swings, misses. Hub
YANKS him off the horse, leaps up, pulls Jasmine up behind
him. They GALLOP away....

WALTER 100

WALTER
So how come all those assassins
stopped coming? All we get here
now are salesman.

GARTH
Hub was furious at the constant
danger to Jasmine; he knew the
Sheik would never stop. There was
only one thing to do. So: one day
an assassin led Hub, bound in
chains, into the Sheik's fortress
to claim the ten thousand pieces

of gold.
WALTER
WHAT. ..?
WALTER'S IMAGINATION - SHEIK'S PALACE 101

NIGHT. Two riders on horseback approach the Sheik's
fortress: a masked Assassin leads Hub, covered with chains.

Inside, the Sheik's GUARDS surround a face-covered Assassin
leading the bound Hub before the evil Sheik.

GARTH (0.S.)
The Assassin was given bags and
bags full of gold, more than most
men could carry, as the cruel Sheik
ordered that Hub be taken down
into the Sheik's notorious "Dungeon
of One Thousand, Three Hundred and
Eighty-Seven Tortures"....

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE TORTURE CHAMBER 103

As the Assassin juggles his heavy burden of gold, his
facecloth slips just enough to reveal... it's Garth.

WALTER (0.S.)

A ha! It was a trick!
GUARDS lead the helpless, chained Hub into a nightmarish
torture chamber. Terrifying HOODED TORTURERS await.

GARTH (0.S.)

In the dungeon, I whipped out my
sword and singlehandedly killed
everyone and freed Hub, without
dropping a single gold coin....

Garth whips out a sword, easily defeats the bad guys, and
frees a grateful, humble Hub....

WALTER (0.S.)
Wait _a_minute! Wait a minute!

GARTH, WALTER 104
Walter looks very skeptical.

WALTER
You killed all the bad guys? You
saved Uncle Hub? And all that
time you were carrying hundreds of
pounds of gold?

GARTH
You don't believe I killed all
those men and saved Hub?
Walter shakes his head: nope, he doesn't. Garth SIGHS.

Hub throws off his chains and fights the Sheik's men.
Garth fumbles for his pistol, trying not to drop the gold.

GARTH (0.S.)
We were greatly outnumbered. We
fought incredible odds....

Garth tries to juggle gold and aim, but Hub is faster and
dispatches Garth's target first. Garth scowls as Hub
defeats the bad guys before Garth can fire a single shot.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Then we split up: we each knew
what we had to do....

At the doorway, Hub heroically salutes Garth, runs swiftly
away. Garth hobbles out with his heavy burden of gold.

WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE SHEIK'S BED CHAMBER 106

GARTH
High in his opulent bed chamber,
the Sheik slept. Until he awoke
with Hub's sword at his throat....

Hub stands atop the bed, his blade pins the Sheik

GARTH (Cont'd)
Terrified, the Sheik knew his life
was over, that Hub would certainly
kill him. Hub smiled... then
lowered his blade. He threw the
Sheik a sword, honorably offering
his lifelong enemy a fair fight.
"Defend yourself!" Hub cried.

The evil Sheik grins. The fight begins: CLANG-CLANG!

And almost instantly, faster than the eye can follow, Hub
sends the Sheik's sword flying and pins the Sheik once
again, against a pillar, his blade to the Sheik's throat.

GARTH (Cont'd)
It was over in a second: Hub had
humbled him. The Sheik knew he
was surely now a dead man, with no
right to even beg for mercy....

As Hub smiles and raises his blade high, the Sheik falls
to the floor, WHIMPERING, closing his eyes.... And nothing
happens. The Sheik looks up: Hub stands in a window.

Hub leaps out into darkness. The Sheik runs up, looks
out: far, far below, Hub and Garth GALLOP away into the
dark desert night.

GARTH (Cont'd)
From that moment on, the
assassination attempts stopped.
Some say it's because the Sheik
knew that, next time, Hub would
surely return and kill him, as he
had promised.

The Sheik feels his tender but still-intact throat, and
stares after the vanished horsemen.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Others say that since Hub had twice
spared the Sheik's life, the Sheik
felt it was a point of honor to
allow his enemy to live.

WALTER 107
Walter smiles blissfully. Either way sounds right.

GARTH
Personally, I think the Sheik just
got too darn busy once they
discovered oil in his kingdom and
he became one of the five richest
men in the world....

Garth does an amazing waterfall of cards a yard long.

GARTH
One of the ways....

Walter blinks. Below, Hub watches the hoods drive away.

WALTER
Hey, wait! You still didn't tell
me what happened to Jasmine! After
Uncle Hub defeated the Sheik there
was nothing standing in their way,
right? Then where the HECK is

Garth puts a finger to his lips: Hub stiffly ascends the
porch, plops down into his chair.

HUB
Those young men will be OK now.

GARTH
Will you?

Hub leans back painfully, exhales.

HUB
Damn it. I feel... old.

GARTH
You've been busy. Terrorizing

fishing poles in the water, having no luck. Hub looks

Walter sends a clay target flying, reaches into the box

A dog runs up, a ear of corn in its mouth to play catch.
Walter smiles, puts the corn on the machine: BOING

Hub and Garth blast the flying ear of corn out of the
sky. Both give Walter "atta boy" grins.

SLOW MOTION: ear after ear of corn poetically bites the
dust. By the machine, Garth loads up corn from a bushel.

Walter wrestles with a shotgun larger than he is, getting
lessons from Hub; Walter has a pillow tied to his butt.
Walter fires, the recoil knocks him onto his pillow-
cushioned-butt. Hub slaps Walter on the back

In the cornfield jungle, the lion watches, happy.

Walter struggles into his pants: he can't fasten them at
the waist, too small. He looks down: they're now too
short. With a surprised grin, Walter realizes: he's grown.

He looks into a murky mirror: he's filled out, his pale
complexion now more tanned. Compared to the timid, pale
child who arrived in early summer, he's blossomed.

A HONK from outside: Walter looks out the window: a truck
pulls into the farm carrying an old biplane.

circle the plane dubiously: half the propeller is missing.

That people are basically good.
That honor, virtue, and courage

power mean nothing. That good
always triumphs over evil. That

Doesn't matter if they're true or

things anyway. Because they are

criminals and they lied to you.

Walter starts to CRY. Mae clutches him to her chest.

MAE
My poor baby! In the arms of
vicious criminals! We rushed here
as soon as we knew, we've come to
take you away! Now tell Stan where
the money is and go pack your
things...

Walter looks up at her.

WALTER
Why do you need to know where the
money is?

STAN

It's stolen, it doesn't belong to
them. Bet it's buried outside,
isn't it?

Caught off guard, Walter almost nods, catches himself.

WALTER
But why do you need to know?

MAE
Walter!

Stan stands, takes out a big flashlight.

STAN
Walt, let's take a walk. You can
show us around the place.

At the door, Stan and Mae wait for Walter expectantly;
dazed, he joins them.

EXT. BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND BARN - PRE-DAWN 129

In the eerie, shimmering mists of pre-dawn, Stan shines

the light around, watches Walter closely for a reaction:

as the beam hits the barn, Walter's eyes widen. They

walk toward the barn: Stan uses the flashlight and Walter's
reactions as a divining rod.

STAN
Now Walter. Your mother and I
found this nice house, just like
you always wanted. But we don't
have enough for a down payment.
We could turn your uncles in for
the reward, but they'd go to jail...

He sees Walter shakes even more as they near the barn.

STAN (Cont'd)
I know you wouldn't like that. So
we thought: with all the money
your uncles have, they'd never
miss it if we took some. Especially
since we're doing them such a big
favor by keeping our mouths shut.

MAE
Since it's stolen, we have as much
right to it as they do.

STAN
Nobody gets hurt, and we get a
nice home and family. See?

MAE
Isn't it wonderful, Walter? It's
what you always wanted! So,
Walter.... where is it?

Walter's struggles build and build. Ahead, in the early
morning mist... the barn looms.

STAN
C'mon! They're old, they're gonna
die soon anyway. You want the
government to get it all?

MAE
We finally have our chance to be
happy, honey. Just tell us.

They're in front of the barn. Walter shakes, terrified,
torn. Then, softly, an Arab flute PLAYS hauntingly.

Suddenly, Walter's struggles cease; his trembling stops
He's made up his mind. He smiles.

WALTER
Hub and Garth didn't rob any banks.
They were in Africa.

MAE
Africa? Walter! Be serious!

WALTER
Really! They were shanghaied into
the Foreign Legion and had
adventures for forty years! They
couldn't have robbed any banks!

MAE
Then where'd they get the money?

WALTER
Well, Uncle Garth ransomed Uncle
Hub to this rich evil Sheik....

MAE
Walter!

WALTER
...who hated Hub for stealing the
Princess Jasmine out of his harem
and killing all his assassins....

STAN
Walter, you don't believe that!

WALTER
Yeah. Uh-huh. Sure I do!

MAE

You? Mr. Doubting-Thomas? Here,
Stan has actual evidence, and you
believe that Africa crap? Walter,
you've never believed in anything
your entire life! And now you
mean to tell me that out of all
the things you could have picked
to believe in, you believe this?
Harems? Princesses? Evil Sheiks?

Walter seems as surprised as her.

WALTER
Yeah...! Isn't that something?

MAE
Now I want you to think hard. Do
you really believe this Africa
nonsense? Really and truly? From
the bottom of your heart?

Walter thinks very, very hard. He seems to search his
soul. Then he smiles proudly.

WALTER
Yes. Yes I do.

Mae throws up her hands. Stan takes Walter's arm.
STAN
Mae, go inside and let us men talk.
Man to man.
Walter look troubled at this. So does Mae.

WALTER
Mom...?

STAN
Go on Mae. We'll be right in.

Mae bites her lip anxiously, then nods, walks off. Stan
takes Walter by the arm, pulls him into the barn.

INT. THE BARN - PRE-DAWN 130
Walter panics as they near the trap door; he struggles.

WALTER
Let go!

Stan SLAPS Walter hard. Walter is stunned. Stan drags
Walter to his feet: they're standing on the trap door.

STAN
Now. Let's me and you get a few
things straight: you and me can be
friends. Or we can be enemies.

The old Walter would have cringed, maybe started crying.
But this Walter glares right back

STAN (Cont'd)
I've had a run of crummy luck
lately, and some bad people are
looking to make things tough for
me. I need that money, I know
it's real close, and I'll be damned
if some little brat is gonna stand
in my way!

Walter glares back at Stan with Hub-like murderous fury.

STAN (Cont'd)
So. Are we friends? Or enemies?

Walter smiles. A very cold smile. A very Hub smile.
Somewhere, far off, Arabic music PLAYS.

WALTER
Defend yourself!
STAN

Huh?
Walter kicks the crouching Stan right in the crotch: THUD.

STAN (Cont'd)
QOOF!

Walter runs out of the barn. Stan stumbles after him:

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BARN - PRE-DAWN

Walter runs, looks back: Stan gains on him. Walter darts
toward the cornfield; but Stan tackles him.

Stan pins Walter to the ground, SLAPS him hard. Walter
SCREAMS. Stan puts his hand over Walter's mouth.

Beyond the struggle looms the cornfield. SLAP.

EXT. THE CORNFIELD - PRE-DAWN

The edge of the cornfield rustles: the lion looks out:
she sees Walter pinned on the ground, struggling. SLAP.

The lion's eyes narrow fiercely: a look never seen on

this lion before. GGGGRRRROOOWWWLLL !

STAN, WALTER

Stan freezes: what was that? Then, behind him, impossibly

fast, comes a speeding lion freight train. The lion SLAMS
into Stan, both fly off Walter. GRROWWLL!

 

Dazed, Walter sits up: what happened? He sees a lion
furiously attacking Stan with everything its got. A lion

in its prime... A real lion. GRROOWWLL!
WALTER
».. JASMINE. ..?!

EXT. THE UNCLES' HOUSE - LONG SHOT

Lights CLICK on: Hub and Garth run out, carrying shotguns.

EXT. RUNNING FROM FRONT PORCH TOWARD CORNFIELD - DAWN
Hub, Garth, and Mae run toward the frightful HOWLS:
GGGGRRROOO... The cry CHOKES and cuts off, mid-roar
there's one last death-rattle WHEEZE... then SILENCE.
EXT. NEAR THE CORNFIELD - PRE-DAWN

Hub, Garth, and Mae run up, see the lion sprawled atop
Stan, both lie still. Walter picks up the lion's head.

All see Walter's bruises, put two and two together

HUB (Cont'd)
What happened... did he do that?

Hub GROWLS and grabs Stan, but Garth stops him.
GARTH
We have to get him to the hospital.
Mae, get your car. Mae! Your
car!
Mae is nearly hysterical, but she nods, rushes off.

GARTH (Cont'd)
Let's get the lion off him.

All turn over the limp lion, look down. Garth WHISTLES.
GARTH (Cont'd)
I believe this man's gonna need
some stitches.

HUB
A lot of stitches.

But Walter only cares about Jasmine: he cradles the limp
head of the valiant lion in his lap.

WALTER
What happened to her?

GARTH
It looks like her old heart just
gave out in all the excitement.
She was plenty old, you know.

WALTER
Look! She's... smiling.

They look: she does indeed look as if she's smiling.

WALTER
She really was a real lion, wasn't
she? There, at the end. A real
jungle lion. A real Africa lion!

Hub and Garth nod. Beyond them, the cornfield rustles in
the pale early morning light. DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THE CORNFIELD - DAY 137

Inside the cornfield, wearing Sunday best: Walter, Hub,
Garth, and the animals surround a grave-mound: they've
buried the lion where she belonged, in the cornfield.

Walter SNIFFLES as he POUNDS in a wooden cross, says a
silent prayer, and looks up at his uncles. Pause.

GARTH
You finish packing?
(Walter nods sadly)
Your momma's gonna be back from
the hospital soon. You can wait
for her on the front porch.

He nods. The uncles sadly watch him trudge to the house.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY 138

Forlorn, Walter waits on the front porch, surrounded by
dogs and the pig, all in the same mournful mood.

Mae's Cadillac pulls up, with a bandaged Stan the front-
seat passenger. Mae exits, approaches:

MAE
So, all packed? Where's your
suitcase?

WALTER

Upstairs. In my room.

MAE
Let's go get it.
WHITE Revision - 8/25/02 87.

139 INT./EXT. THE CADILLAC - DAY 139

Stan is a mummy, immobilized in bandages head to toe.
His eyes widen in alarm as he sees Hub and Garth approach.

GARTH
Howdy, Stan.

STAN
Mmmm! = Mmmm-MMMM !

HUB
Stan, you were lucky... lucky that
lion got you before we did!

Stan's eyes grow very wide.

HUB (Cont'd)
Know they do to men who hurt kids
back in North Africa, Stan?
(Stan shakes his head)
Well! First they take a rope....

140 INT. THE TOWER ROOM - DAY 140
Walter looks around his tower room for the last time.

Outside the window, Mae sees the uncles lecture to Stan
with a lot of descriptive hand-and-arm motions.

MAE
I wonder what your uncles are saying
to Stan?

WALTER

Probably their "What Every Boy
Needs to Know About Being A Man"

speech.

MAE
I'm glad to see they're making
friends.

Walter carefully puts his precious photo of Jasmine atop
his clothes, closes his suitcase.

MAE (Cont'd)
There now. Ready?

HUB
...and then, after every bone in

pounds of salt....

Just getting warmed-up, Hub sees Walter and Mae approach.

HUB (Cont'd)
Oh well. To make a long story
short, Stan: you and me can be
friends.... or we can be enemies.

Hub gives him that look: the helpless Stan quakes. Hub
SLAPS Stan hard on the back: Stan MOANS, nearly faints.

MAE
I hope Walter wasn't too much
trouble.

HUB
We managed.

GARTH

(nods at Stan)
What are you gonna do about him?

HUB
Man like that's got no business
being around your boy.

MAE
Oh, of course! What kind of mother
would I be? We're just dropping
him off in Vegas on our way....

Time to say goodbye. Garth SIGHS, Hub looks uptight, the
dogs look miserable, and Walter's eyes grow wet. Pause.

WALTER
...I'll be back for the rest of
that speech... if... if...

Walter stumbles. But Hub answers definitively:

HUB
I'll be here.

Walter SNIFFLES, then rushes to Hub and hugs him, low.
Hub awkwardly pats him on the back. Walter turns to Garth.

INT. THE CADILLAC - DAY 142

The animals sadly press their noses against Walter's
window. As the car pulls away, he starts to cry.

EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY 143

The uncles sadly watch the Cadillac drive away.

 

HUB
Damn it! That woman don't deserve
that kid! Let's get us a lawyer!

GARTH
No judge is gonna take a child
away from its mother and give it
to two old bachelor uncles.

HUB
Maybe she'll sell him to us! How
much money we got?

GARTH
Hub! There's nothing we can do.

He looks out, sees the field of bluebonnets pass by.

WALTER
So. Where we going?
MAE
I told you. Las Vegas.
WALTER
I mean after. After we drop Stan
off.
MAE

Well now, honey, Stan's gonna need

She reaches over and pats Stan gently on the knee.
And suddenly Walter knows everything: he GASPS.

Walter grabs the car door, opens it, sees asphalt and
grass racing past... and starts to jump.

The Caddy SWERVES violently, Mae SLAMS on the brakes

Stan SMASHES into the windshield... and Walter jumps.

Walter rolls to a stop, jumps to his feet, scuffed but

unhurt. He runs up a small rise overlooking the road.

HUB
Whoop de do.

A dog's head goes up; so does another's. The uncles look
up: far down the road, a small figure approaches, on foot.
The uncles squint: who is it? The dogs run down the road
BARKING. Finally the uncles' eyes bug out: they drop
their shotguns and hustle down the steps to meet...

WALTER 150

Walter, carrying his bag, trudges up to the uncles, sets
down his bag, and smiles. All three--this new family--
grin at each other. Happily, this time.

WALTER
If I'm gonna live here, there's
some conditions....

HUB
CONDITIONS?

WALTER
One: you both stick around until
I'm through high school at least,
preferably college. You both got
responsibilities now: PTA, Boy
Scouts, Little League, the works.

Hub GROANS. Garth hides a smile. Finally, both nod.

HUB
Looks like we got no choice...!

yourselves: more vegetables, less
meat.

Sir, they've passed away.

A sketch: a child's lettered sign "Africa" points to a
cornfield where a whimsical lion sticks out her head.

The lion and her companion, a small boy in a pith helmet
explore an exotic African jungle cornfield. The strip is
entitled: "Walter and Jasmine".

TELEPHONE (Cont'd)
It's a blessing they didn't suffer.

Night: by a cornfield and lake is a familiar ramshackle
house, a light on at the top of its leaning tower

TELEPHONE (Cont'd)
And a blessing too, in a way, that
they went together...
A hand freezes over a drawing: the boy addresses his
"troops" that include a pack of dogs, chickens, and a
surly pig. The lion looks skeptical.

We had a bunch of reporters out
here earlier. Even CNN. I guess

flown by two ninety year-old men
with no pilots' licenses, well....

Both try to keep straight faces, finally both grin.

Here. I found their will.

A single piece of paper. Walt reads the scrawls:

WALT
"The kid gets it all. Just plant
us in the damn garden with the
stupid lion."

Walt's eyes become wet. He looks out at the garden, and
the lake beyond. Wind rustles stalks of corn.

WALT (Cont'd)
These last few months, my Uncle
Hub's been sick with pneumonia.
From sleepwalking. More and more
lately, we'd find him out there in
the middle of the night, staring
out over the water....

through rows of beautiful vegetables to the grave site,
between the tomatoes and the watermelons.

WALT'S WIFE arrives. TWO BOYS bounce out of the car,
dueling with curved plastic Arab swords.

By now, perhaps two dozen people stand among the

WALT (Cont'd)
Oh. Well.... In her life, my
mother made a lot of mistakes.
But once, by sheer accident, she
did do something right: she dumped
me off one summer with two crazy
old men. And there, in the most
unlikely of places, I found a home.
My home.

The wind blows softly, rustles the corn stalks.

WALT (Cont'd)
They had no idea of how to deal
with a troubled little kid. So,
they told me stories. Amazing,
unbelievable stories. Stories
about harems, sheiks and princesses,
valiant men and evil villains.
About courage. Honor. They knew
those stories were exactly what a
terrified young boy needed to hear.

Walt smiles wryly, shakes his head.

WALT (Cont'd)
Even though we cynical adults know
such tall tales can't possibly be
true, I believed them. In a way,
I still believe them. Because, as
my Uncle Hub taught me, just because
something isn't true, that's no
reason you shouldn't believe in
it. That's what fathers do for
sons: teach them the things that,
despite everything, are worth
believing in.

Some folks don't understand. But others do.

WALT (Cont'd)
It was the proudest day of my life
when I turned eighteen and Hub
gave me his full, unabridged, "What
Every Boy Needs to Know About Being
a Man" speech.

WALT (Cont'd)
Please, as you leave, help yourself
to all the vegetables you can carry.

LAUGHS. And it's over. All start to leave. But then:
WHOOSH! Airbrakes: two huge livestock trucks pull in.

Everyone looks puzzled. Big doors SLAM DOWN: SOLDIERS on
horseback leap out, riding beautiful Arabian stallions.
Foreign soldiers wearing kepis and kerchiefs, desert
uniforms. Foreign Legion uniforms.

WALT'S BOYS
It's The Legion!

The Legion forms up into a mounted Honor Guard. walt
can't believe his eyes. Nor can anyone.

Then, they see another vehicle drive up: a long, long
limo pulls up and parks; its doors open: a dozen ARAB
WOMEN wearing veils emerge in a dense pack, surrounding
someone of obvious importance. The pack approaches.

Walt's boys' eyes shine. They watch the Legion on
horseback, stallions prancing in glorious precision.

And then, at the garden's edge, the pack of women parts:
revealing an old, old man in a wheelchair, an ancient
SHEIK who wears an eyepatch and has a long scar running
down one side of his once-handsome but cruel face.

WALT'S BOYS (Cont'd)
Yikes!

Walt is startled; his sons jump behind him, and peer out:
The old sheik glares at the coffins with incredible fury.
The women start WAILING mournfully; the old sheik glares
at them, then shakes his fist at the two coffins.

Old enemies die hard.
