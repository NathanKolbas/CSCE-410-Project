GOOD BOYS

April 4, 2017
HIGH ABOVE THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. Suburban sprawl. Blue
pools and green yards as far as the eye can see. We slowly
DESCEND to --

EXT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SAME

Two teens -- HANNAH, 16, popular with strong, uninformed
opinions and LILY, 16, intense and captain of the varsity
field hockey team, sunbathe poolside. They pass a vape pen

between them.

HANNAH
I’m so over music festivals.

LILY
They're so fucking corporatized.

HANNAH
Totally, except for Coachella,
which is more than a festival.

LILY
Yeah, it’s more a way of life.

We HEAR a buzzing. They look up.
REVERSE ANGLE

A DRONE -- the PHANTOM 3 STANDARD QUADCOPTER -- hovers high
above them.

LILY (CONT'D)
What the fuck?

From inside, JASLYN, 16, approaches the sliding glass door.
She has the beauty of Kendall Jenner and the intelligence of
Kendall Jenner. She walks into the glass door.

JASLYN
Owww! Not again.

Jaslyn, holding her head, opens the slider and joins them.

LILY
Do you hear that buzzing?

JASLYN
(re her head)
You can hear that, too?
CUT TO:

THE SMILING FACES OF THREE SIXTH GRADE BOYS.
One of them mans the drone on an iPad, which feeds into a
FLAT SCREEN TV.

BOY
Tits.

EXT. HANNAH'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SAME
The girls quickly cover themselves.

JASLYN
I bet it’s that old guy who tried
taking pictures of your feet.

HANNAH
I know who it is.

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME
ON THE DRONE FEED, the girls give them the finger.

MAX
Why do they hate us? They don’t
even know us.

This is MAX, 12, flanked by the two other boys. He isn’t the
coolest or the smartest kid, but he’s cool and smart enough.
Loves dinosaurs and skateboards. Recently discovered
masturbation.

Two small hands snatch the iPad from Max.

QUENTIN
Holy fucking shit! Drop the towels!
Drop the towels!

This is QUENTIN, 12. He’s short and stout and isn’t happy
about it. Considers himself hyper-intelligent, but really
just parrots sentence fragments he hears adults say. Recently
discovered masturbation.

Another boy grabs a couch cushion and humps it wildly.

BOY/FABRIZIO
Ayyyyyyyyeeeeeeeee! !

This is FABRIZIO, 12. Hyper and horny foreign exchange student.
The language barrier is very real. Dresses like he’s about to
have lunch in Capri. Been masturbating for ten months.
QUENTIN
I’m going lower. Get ready for some
major titillation.

BOY’S VOICE (0.S.)
What the fuck?!

TURN TO REVEAL XAVIER-RAYMOND, 12, bounding down the stairs.
Everyone calls him X-Ray. Cool nickname, but he’s neurotic,
suffers from IBS and is prone to crying fits. He’s just come
from upstairs, where he was masturbating.

MAX
Your neighbor's in a bikini! And
she has friends over! Girls!
X-RAY
I don’t care! I fucking told you,
I’m not allowed to use my dad’s
stuff unless supervised. You guys
never listen to me!

QUENTIN
Just five more minutes.

X-RAY
No!

X-Ray lunges at Quentin, who yanks the control away.

BACK TO:

EXT. HANNAH'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SAME

The Girls stare up as the Drone LURCHES from side to side,
DROPS thirty feet, SPINS out of control.

BACK TO:

INT. X-RAY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Quentin and X-Ray jostle for control of the iPad. Fabrizio
now dry-humps the pillow from behind.

X-RAY
You're gonna break it! Give it!

QUENTIN
Fine!

Quentin lets go, sending X-Ray falling back. The iPad SLIDES
under the couch. They all GASP.
EXT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SAME

The Drone suddenly NOSEDIVES, going straight for the Girls,
who scream and DUCK for cover.

INT. X-RAY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

ON THE DRONE FEED

The boys watch in horror as the DRONE plummets. Max scrambles
to the couch and stretches out his arm. The iPad is just out

of reach.

MAX
Lift it!

The others can barely lift the couch, but it’s just enough
for Max to reach the iPad.

MAX (CONT'D)
Got it!
EXT. HANNAH'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SAME

The drone STABILIZES mere feet from the ground.

INT. X-RAY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME
The boys breathe a sigh of relief.
ON THE DRONE FEED

Almost like a zombie movie, the three GIRLS move toward the
drone, arms outstretched.

FABRIZIO
Go up! Go up! Go up!

Max jerks the iPad up. The Drone rises, barely escaping
Lily's outstretched hand.

The guys CHEER, until --

EXT. HANNAH'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - SAME

Hannah LAUNCHES herself off a chaise lounge, GRABBING the
landing skids of the drone and taking it down.
INT. X-RAY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

The camera shakes, catching images of grass, sky and then --
HANNAH'S FACE comes into focus. The boys stare in horror.

HANNAH
Listen, you little --

A hand covers the drone’s camera. The screen goes BLACK. After
a beat, all three girls appear in frame, smiling and flirty.

LILY
Hey guys, we want to hang out.
We’re soooo lonely over here.

JASLYN
I need someone to rub lotion on me.

ON THE BOYS
Slack-jawed. Quentin turns to the others.

QUENTIN
Let's go.

Fabrizio pulls a travel-sized Axe Body Spray from his pocket
and douses himself.

MAX
Wait! What if it’s a trap?

QUENTIN
Not everything is a trap, Max. Just
deal with the fact that they want
to party. We’ll go over there, lick
some tits, and get the drone back.

MAX
They’re four grades older than us!

FABRIZIO
They horny cougars.

MAX
We’re not going to a stranger's
house. We'll wait for your mom to
come home. She can walk us over.

QUENTIN
Fine. Whatever.

X-RAY
They have my dad’s drone. I’1l go
myself.
MAX
Wait, you can’t go over there alone.
They've been smoking drugs all day.

QUENTIN
We're coming with you. They could
be erratic.
They all head for the door. Quentin stops, considering:
QUENTIN (CONT'D)
I hope they don’t have STDs.
I/E. HANNAH’S HOUSE - DAY
Hannah opens the front door to REVEAL our four boys. They’ve

all combed their hair and tucked in their shirts. Hannah
towers over the boys.

FABRIZIO
Ciao, bella.
HANNAH
Come in, guys. We’ve been waiting

for you.
X-Ray clocks the drone on the kitchen island.

QUENTIN
Thank you. This is a lovely home.

The boys study the girls with a mix of fear and desire.
X-RAY
(quiet, to Max)
They’re huge.

As soon as they’ve stepped into the foyer, Lily appears
behind them and SLAMS the door shut, LOCKING them in.

QUENTIN
It’s a trap!

Lily and Jaslyn block the door.
HANNAH
You think it’s cool to objectify

women?

The boys clearly have no idea what “objectify” means.
MAX
(unsure)
We weren't. We were just looking at
your bodies.

HANNAH
We need a guarantee that you’1l
never objectify anyone again.

MAX
Like what?

CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S HOUSE - LATER
Hannah, Lily and Jaslyn stifle laughs.

LILY
Get out here!

The Boys enter, completely transformed: dresses, makeup,
painted fingernails, mascara, barrettes, the works.

JASLYN
Ooh, I want the little one. I want
to put her in my pocket.

QUENTIN
I’m not little. My doctor says I’m
going to be 5'9”, honey.

LILY
Relax, Munchkin.

Hannah holds up her phone and snaps PHOTOS.

MAX
What are you gonna do with those?

HANNAH
Maybe I’11 send them to my sister.
She's in eighth grade at John
Adams. Isn’t that where you go?
Hannah tosses the phone into her bright yellow BEACH BAG.

LILY
You’re gonna have to transfer schools.

X-Ray begins hyperventilating. Mascara RUNS down his face.
X-RAY
Give us... the ... drone!

Lily takes the Drone and puts it on the floor. She lifts her
foot over it, taunting him. Hannah and Jaslyn laugh.

X-Ray runs over and covers the Drone, protecting it.

QUENTIN (0.S.)
Fuck you, STD bitches!

They look over to see Quentin holding Hannah’s beach bag.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
I have her phone! Run!

Quentin races out the back, Hannah hot on his heels. X-Ray
BITES Lily in the calf.

LILY
Owww !

X-Ray scoops up the Drone and races for the yard.

Max and Fabrizio follow. Jaslyn jumps in front of them.
Fabrizio KICKS her in the crotch. She goes down.

MAX
That’s what you get!

BAM! From the ground, Jaslyn UPPERCUTS Max in his balls. He
crumples. X-Ray and Fabrizio scoop him up and keep running.
EXT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Quentin races alongside the pool. Hannah’s gaining.

He runs past a patio chair and knocks it down, TRIPPING
Hannah. The other boys hurdle over her and join Quentin.

They reach an EIGHT FOOT FENCE blocking them in. To them, it
might as well be twenty feet.

MAX
Ten fingers!

Max lifts Quentin up and over, followed by Fabrizio, who then
pulls Max up.

Max straddles the top of the fence and lowers his arm down to
X-Ray, who cradles the drone. Max strains to pull him up. x-
Ray looks back. The girls are gaining.
X-RAY
Pull! Pull!

He’s almost over when suddenly, he’s jerked back. Lily pulls
at the drone’s plastic frame.

X-RAY (CONT'D)
She’s too strong!

X-Ray loses his grip on the drone.

X-RAY (CONT'D)
It’s slipping!

Lily pulls the drone away from X-Ray. It falls to the ground.

She grabs his leg. X-Ray struggles to wrestle free and

accidentally KICKS her in the head.

LILY
Ow! You kicked me in the head!

X-RAY
On accident!

Lily SMASHES the drone.

X-RAY (CONT'D)
Nooo!

Max pulls X-Ray over the fence.
ON THE STREET

X-RAY (CONT'D)
She broke the drone!! FUCK!

QUENTIN
(calling over the fence)
Fucking cougars!!

A COUPLES passes pushing a stroller.

MOTHER
Language, girls!

BOYS
Sorry.

The boys RACE down the street, sundresses flapping in the wind.
CHYRON:

GOOD BOYS
10.
The boys run THROUGH THE TITLE and turn into X-Ray’s
driveway, just as a BMW pulls in.
A handsome, middle-aged man steps out. He carries himself
like a former athlete. This is X-RAY’S DAD. He looks the boys
up and down, taking in the dresses. He looks disgusted.
X-RAY’S DAD
(snapping)
Why are you dressed like that?
No one speaks. X-Ray’s Dad shakes his head.
X-RAY’S DAD (CONT’D)
Tell your friends you'll see them

tomorrow.

The boys watch as X-Ray’s Dad leads him to the front door --
dead man walking.

CUT TO:

INT. LILY'S MINI COOPER - THE NEXT DAY

Lily drives. Hannah sits shotgun, phone to her ear. Jaslyn
leans in from the back.

JASLYN
Those little shits aren’t picking up.

LILY
Should we call Jordy?

Whoever Jordy is, none of them jump at this idea.

JASLYN
Why were we even holding Jordy’s
drugs?

HANNAH

(as to a child)
When you have two strikes, you
can’t hold your own drugs, Jaslyn.
And we each get a free pill.

LILY
What if those kids open the bottle
and overdose on Molly? We put them
in a fucking Flintstones Vitamins
bottle!
11.

JASLYN
(optimistic)
Or what if they open the bottle,
take Molly, and have the best day
of their lives?!

Off the Girls, considering.

INT. BUS - DAY
CLOSE ON

Quentin, struggling mightily to open a FLINTSTONES VITAMIN
PILL CONTAINER.

QUENTIN
Whatever. Chewables suck. Gummies
are so much better.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Max, Quentin, and Fabrizio, all dressed in SCHOOL UNIFORMS,
sit at the front of the bus. They rummage through Hannah's
bag.

Fabrizio pulls out a tampon. Quentin snatches and inhales
deeply. Another KID peers over and gags.

KID
OH MY GOD! Gross!
(then, calling back)
Soren! They have a tampon!

SOREN, 12, who looks like the son of Cindy Crawford and Rande
Gerber, calls from the back of the bus.

SOREN
Hey, Quentin, stick it up your
pussy hole!

QUENTIN

Fuck you, you sexist bitch! I'1l
stick my dick up your nose!

Quentin stands on the seat and starts thrusting wildly in the
air. Max slouches in his seat, embarrassed.

MAX
(quiet)
Just sit down. This is why they’re
always making fun of us.
12.

QUENTIN
Who cares what he thinks? He has
the same haircut as my sister.

The bus STOPS and a few kids, including X-Ray, step on. He
looks terrible.

MAX
So what happened with your dad?

X-Ray hands Max a BROCHURE.

MAX (CONT'D)
(reading)
Camden Academy for Boys?
(then)
That’s that boarding school in
Nevada. Matt Chestnut went there.

X-RAY
It’s where my dad went. He thinks I
need it. He said I’m weak.

FABRIZIO
If he think that, he don’t know
you.

QUENTIN

You can’t go to boarding school.
You couldn't even make it through
tennis camp.

(then)
You need to stand up to him.

X-RAY
(defeated)
I know, okay?

X-Ray looks down.
X-RAY (CONT'D)
He’s looking for an excuse. He said

if I screw up again, I’m gone.

MAX
It’s just a stupid drone.

X-RAY
He doesn’t know that I broke it.

MAX
So when he finds out...
13.

X-RAY
(quiet)
++. I’m gone.

They take this in. Quentin pulls out his phone.

QUENTIN
Ridiculous. I’m texting my nanny.
She can go to the mall and get a
new drone. She has my dad’s credit
card for emergencies. Problem
solved.

X-Ray exhales, relieved.

The theme song of “PRETTY LITTLE LIARS” starts playing from
inside Max's backpack. He pulls out Hannah’s phone. The
caller ID reads: LILY.

MAX
They've called a thousand times.

Quentin takes the phone.
MAX (CONT'D)
Get her passcode so we can delete
the pictures.
Quentin answers.
QUENTIN
You smell like a fart and taste
like shit.

Quentin hangs up. Fabrizio, Quentin, and X-Ray laugh, pleased
with themselves.

MAX
You didn’t get the code.

QUENTIN
Who cares? We have the phone, what
are they going to do?
EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

To establish.

The bus pulls up to the curb. Waiting for them are HANNAH,
LILY, and JASLYN.
14.

INT. SCHOOL BUS - SAME

The other students get off the bus. Our guys just stare out
the window, terrified of the girls.

X-RAY
What do we do? We can’t go out
there.

QUENTIN

(calling to Bus Driver)
We need SCAB.

MAX
No way. We’1l look like losers.

QUENTIN
Do you wanna die??

CUT TO:

EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
SLO MO. Over Katy Perry’s “ROAR” --

Max, Quentin, X-Ray, and Fabrizio confidently step out of the
bus and join a PONY-TAILED TEACHER and eight of the LEAST
POPULAR STUDENTS in the school. They’re all wearing blue
smocks that read “STUDENT COALITION AGAINST BULLYING.”

SCAB MEMBERS
(chanting)
Bullying is whack, get on the right
track! Bullying is whack, get on
the right track!

Max is mortified. This is so uncool.

The SCAB MEMBERS, along with our boys, interlock arms to form
a HUMAN CHAIN. They march up to Hannah, Lily, and Jaslyn. The
SCAB LEADER, a boy with a wispy mustache and a heavy lisp,
addresses the girls.

SCAB LEADER
When you attack one of uth, you
attack all of uth! Your weakneth
giffs uth strength!

The Girls stare back, like “Is this happening?”
HANNAH

These kids stole my phone and my
bag! And there’s important stuff --
15.

SCAB LEADER
No, Bully! Not today!
(then)
Head out, headth up!

The Human Chain marches to the school. As they march, we see
the back of their smocks reads, “I’M A SCAB FOR LIFE.” Our
boys turn back to see the girls giving them the “slit your
throat” motion. Hannah’s shirt lifts up slightly, revealing a
hint of flesh. The boys notice.

QUENTIN
Did you see her belly button?

As the boys enter the school, “ROAR” switches from Katy Perry
to -- an ALL BOYS CHORUS.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

We pan over the bored faces of the STUDENTS until we land on
the faces of our four boys -- eyes closed, passionate, deeply
connected to the performance.

A music teacher, MS. GRANDY, 70s, basically deaf, accompanies
them on the piano.

BOYS
(singing)
“I got the eye of the tiger, a
fighter --"

On the word, “FIGHTER,” the boys all pantomime PUNCHING.
BOYS (CONT'D)
(singing)
“Dancing through the fire / Cause I
am the champion...”
On the word, “CHAMPION,” the boys raise their arms in triumph.
BOYS (CONT'D)
(singing)
“And you're gonna hear me roar!”

On the word, “ROAR,” the boys all pantomime ROARING by
rearing their heads back. The song concludes.

MS. GRANDY
That was great, guys!

The bell RINGS. All of the boys quickly head for the door.
16.

MS. GRANDY (CONT’D)
Wait, wait, wait. Big night tonight.
Everyone needs to be in costume by
five-thirty. And make sure to go to
the bathroom before we get on stage.
No accidents this year.

Quentin’s phone BUZZES. He looks around and then walks into a
closet with instruments. He closes the door behind him.

QUENTIN (0.S.)
(into phone)
Hola, Inez, que pasa?
INT. HALLWAY - SAME
Max, X-Ray, and Fabrizio exit. Soren calls out to Max.

SOREN
Max! Come over here.

X-Ray and Fabrizio are surprised. Max hides his excitement.

MAX
Be right back.

Max jogs over. Soren leans against his locker with two
equally cool kids. They all have the same haircut, where they
constantly flick the bangs out of their eyes.

SOREN

Hey, you were really fast in gym.
MAX

Thanks.
SOREN

So are you still coming to my party
after the recital?

MAX
Yeah, I can’t wait.
SOREN
I invited some seventh grade girls,
so... could turn into a kissing party.
MAX

I‘’1l bring gum for the guys.

Soren look over, notices X-Ray and Fabrizio imitating their
favorite DINOSAURS.
17.

SOREN
They are so random.

MAX
Yeah, but they’re kinda cool, too.

ANGLE ON

Quentin. He exits the Music Room, joining X-Ray and Fabrizio.

QUENTIN
Inez can't pick up the drone. Her
husband needs the car.

X-RAY
What the fuck?!

QUENTIN
Yeah, I don’t know why they don’t
get a second car. She’s loaded.
She's always sending money to her
family in Guatemala.

Quentin notices Max and Soren talking. They fist bump.
Quentin looks very concerned.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
What the shit?

Max returns to the others.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
Why were you bantering with that
individual?

(then, concerned)
You didn’t invite him to Benihana
after the recital, right? That’s
just us. That’s our tradition.

MAX
(lying)
Soren just had a question about math.
Max notices that X-Ray’s eye are welling up.

MAX (CONT'D)
What happened?

FABRIZIO
Inez can no drive.
18.

MAX
X-Ray, you can’t cry in school. It
makes us all look weak. Just hold
it in.
X-Ray lets out a squeak. He’s on the verge.

X-RAY
I’m not!

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
The four boys are huddled in a tight stall. X-Ray is BAWLING.

FABRIZIO
Is gonna be okay.

Quentin types into his phone.

QUENTIN
From here to the Fashion Square
Mall is... seventeen minutes.

The door from the hallway opens. They all shush one another.
They listen until they hear the sound of urination.

MAX
(whispering)
Okay, so we'll just miss lunch and
be back by fourth period.

VOICE (0.S.)
Who's crying?

Max peers over the stall to see ROBIN, 12, nosy, peeing.
ROBIN
Should I get a teacher? I’m gonna
get a teacher.
QUENTIN
No, Robin! This is why people call

you “narc.”

ROBIN
Why are you going to the mall?

Fabrizio pops up.

FABRIZIO
To fuck’a your mom!
19.

ROBIN
You wish. My mom’s in San Diego at
a wellness retreat.

Quentin pops up.

QUENTIN

Robin, get the fuck out of here!
ROBIN

I’m allowed to be here. It’s a free

country.
They return to their huddle and continue whispering.

X-RAY
Even if we can get to the mall, how
do we get five hundred dollars?

FABRIZIO
I know how get money. We sell
peaches.

QUENTIN
Peaches? Are you kidding?

MAX
First we get money, then we go to
the mall.
(to X-Ray)
We're not gonna let you get sent to
Camden.

X-RAY
Do you pledge it?

MAX
I pledge it.

Max extends his hand meaningfully. X-Ray takes it, forming
the clasp for the “Boys and Girls Club of America.”

ROBIN (0.S.)
Second bell’s about to ring.

Quentin pops up, his face red with anger.

QUENTIN
Go suck on your mom’s fat tits!

CUT TO:
20.

INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

Students roam the halls in between periods. An elderly
SECURITY GUARD sits at the entrance, reading an AARP Magazine
article about Antonio Banderas. The boys sneak past him.

EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

Quentin, X-Ray and Fabrizio stand on the ROOF, twenty feet
up. They look down nervously at Max, who’s on the ground.

MAX
Come on, it’s easy.

Fabrizio grabs onto a PALM FROND and STEPS OFF THE ROOF. His
weight LOWERS the frond all the way to the ground -- like a
SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON “ELEVATOR.” He lets go and the Palm
Frond snaps back up to the roof.

Quentin follows and lands on the ground. The frond snaps back
up to X-Ray.

X-RAY
I’m scared.

QUENTIN
Just wrap your thong around the
branch and slide down.
(then, to Max and Fabrizio)
You hear what I said to him?

X-Ray throws his bag to the ground and grabs the branch. He
starts to lower, but then it STOPS, leaving him DANGLING ten
feet above the ground. X-Ray’s weight is not enough to bring
the branch all the way down.

X-RAY
Help! Help!

QUENTIN
You should’ve kept your backpack on,
so you'd be heavier!

X-RAY
I took it off to be more nimble.

X-Ray shakes, but the branch doesn’t move. A BEE buzzes by X-
Ray’s face.

X-RAY (CONT'D)
Bee! I’m allergic!

He frantically tries blowing it away. The bee STINGS him.
21.

X-RAY (CONT'D)
Owww!! It stung me! Get my epi-pen!
My throat’s gonna close!
Fabrizio springs to action and grabs X-Ray’s bag, searching
for the epi-pen.

X-RAY (CONT'D)
Okay, I’m gonna drop. Catch me!

Max and Quentin gather underneath X-Ray, arms outstretched.
He DROPS and lands between them with a THUD.
X-RAY (CONT'D)
Owww!
Fabrizio pulls the pen out of X-Ray’s bag and JABS it into x-
Ray’s thigh.
X-RAY (CONT'D)
Owww!
CLOSE ON a UNI-BALL PEN sticking out of his leg.
X-RAY (CONT'D)
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
FABRIZIO
You say a’pen! A’pen!
X-RAY
Epi-pen! Epi-pen! Fucking idiot!
Max pulls the real EPIPEN out of the bag.
MAX
Found it!
Max jabs it into X-Ray’s other leg.

X-RAY
(weakly)

Thank you.
(then, to Fabrizio)

Sorry I called you an idiot.

FABRIZIO
Is okay.
EXT. WOODS BEHIND SCHOOL - LATER

22.

The school recedes in the background. X-Ray LIMPS behind the

others. His pants have puncture wounds and his cheek is

hugely swollen from the sting.
QUENTIN
«+. My sister said girls hate the
word, “moist.”

FABRIZIO
Why?

Quentin shrugs. Max smells his armpit.

MAX
I’m moist right now.

Quentin turns back and takes a photo of X-Ray’s face.

X-RAY
What are you doing?

QUENTIN
Taking a snap of that baby dick on
your cheek.
Max smacks Quentin’s hand.
MAX
No snaps, no stories. Nothing. We
can’t be tracked. We have to stay
off the grid.
Max's phone buzzes. He checks it. Quentin smacks Max's

QUENTIN
What about staying off the grid?

MAX
We got a buyer!

The guys CHEER. They step out of the woods and onto --

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

hand.

Their celebration is short-lived as a POLICE CRUISER, lights

flashing, pulls up alongside them.

QUENTIN
Lemme do the talking.

The OFFICER sticks his head out.
23.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
Hello, Officer. Just want to say
“All Lives Matter.”

POLICE OFFICER
Shouldn't you boys be in school?

A moment of panic as the guys all intuitively turn to Max. He
thinks quickly.

MAX
It’s a Jewish holiday. We're going
to temple.

POLICE OFFICER
Oh, you're Jews?
(then, gives them once-
over)
Stay on the sidewalks.

The Officer drives off.

X-RAY
That was genius!

FABRIZIO
I liked it!

Quentin’s annoyed that someone else is receiving adulation.

QUENTIN
I don’t think it’s “genius” to lie
about religion. With what’s
happening in the world today.

This seems like a deep observation. They contemplate it.

INT. FABRIZIO’S HOUSE - LATER

Quentin and Max play Grand Theft Auto while Fabrizio watches
with interest. X-Ray peers out the window, impatiently.

X-RAY
Where the hell is this guy? He was
supposed to be here already.

QUENTIN
He’s coming. Relax.

Max's Avatar lies prone on a rooftop, taking aim at a FEMALE
COP, who stands beside a trash can fire. He shoots and
misses.
24.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
Why are you shooting that cop?
You're wasting bullets.

MAX
That’s St. Cloud. She’s not even a
cop. She’s bad. She just dresses
like one to rob drug dealers.

QUENTIN
My dads say that these types of
games make you numb to violence.

St. Cloud comes at the Avatar and Max shoots her POINT-BLANK
in the face, causing her head to EXPLODE. None of them react.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
I wish you could see more brains in
her hair.

MAX
If you run her over, she'll shit
herself.

The doorbell RINGS.

X-RAY
(exasperated)
Finally.

He’s about to open the door when --

QUENTIN
(whispers)
Wait! What if he’s a pedophile?

MAX
(considers)
He can’t molest all of us.

X-RAY
He could if he drugs us.

QUENTIN
If he offers you anything to drink,
do not take it.

MAX
Maybe we should get some weapons,
just to be safe.
25.

X-RAY
(through the door)
One minute please! Just need to put
something on!

INT. FABRIZIO’S FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The boys are weaponed up: Max holds a broomstick. Quentin has
a tennis racket. X-Ray enters with a PAINTBALL GUN.

X-RAY
Check it out.

QUENTIN
Switch.

Quentin snatches the paintball gun and hands X-Ray the tennis
racket.

X-RAY
What the hell, Quentin? That was
mine.

QUENTIN
It’s not a toy, okay? Better that I
hold it.
Quentin tucks it in his elastic waistband.

Fabrizio races down the steps. He’s wearing an S&M MASK and
holding a set of ANAL BEADS.

X-RAY
Ugh, gross. Those smell like shit!

They all take a strong whiff.

MAX
What are those?

FABRIZIO
I dunno. I find in Bill and Nancy’s
bedroom. I use to hit.

Fabrizio whips the anal beads over his shoulder like
nunchucks and smacks X-Ray in the face.

X-RAY
Stop!

X-Ray opens the door to REVEAL -- a balding MAN wearing a
Vassar College t-shirt.
26.

He is surprised to be facing four twelve year old boys, one
wearing a leather S&M mask.

X-RAY (CONT'D)

Hi.
CLAUDE

Hello... I’m looking for Max?
MAX

I’m Max.

Max politely extends his hand. Claude shakes it uncertainly.

QUENTIN
Are you a pedophile?

MAX
(to Quentin)
If you were a pedophile, would you

admit it?
QUENTIN
No.
MAX
Then why would he?
CLAUDE
I’m not a pedophile.
MAX
See? We don’t know.
CLAUDE
I’m not!
X-RAY
Do you have the money, Claude?
CLAUDE
Yeah.
FABRIZIO

Okay, yes you come now to basement
but no shoes.
INT. FABRIZIO’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

CLOSE UP: A SEX DOLL’S lifeless eyes and open mouth. Claude
inspects the doll carefully, gently opens her mouth.
27.

CLAUDE
And is this her original mouth and
tongue?

FABRIZIO

I don’t know.

Claude notices the kids looking at him strangely.

CLAUDE
(covering)
Oh, oh. You think? No, no! I want
Peaches for the carpool lane... so

I can get home to my family faster.

BOYS

Ohhhhh...
QUENTIN

We thought you wanted to fuck it.
CLAUDE

Ha ha terrific! I think you mean,

“Fuck her.”
Claude hands Fabrizio a wad of cash.

CLAUDE (CONT'D)
Here you go. Four hundred.

MAX
No, it’s five-fifty. That’s what we
said in the ad.

CLAUDE
Yeah, but now that I’m here and
looking at it and it’s out of the
box -- I feel like it’s only worth
four.

Quentin holds up his hand.

QUENTIN
Claude, you have to see it from our
side: we're running a business
here. If you don’t like the price,
no hard feelings. Have a great day.

The boys look at Quentin like he’s crazy. Quentin turns to
Max.
28.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
Max, give that married couple a
call and tell them they can pick up
the doll.

Claude considers this.

CLAUDE
Well, I don’t want to lose her.

He pulls out some more bills, hands Fabrizio all the cash. He
pulls out a sundress from his satchel.

CLAUDE (CONT'D)
Can you help me dress her?

QUENTIN
Of course, Claude.

The Boys dutifully lift up the doll’s arms as Claude pulls a
sundress from his bag and slides it over her arms.

EXT. FABRIZIO’S HOUSE - DAY

The Boys struggle to carry Peaches to Claude’s Maxima.

CLAUDE
You can just toss her in the trunk.

He opens the trunk and motions for them to place her inside.
X-RAY
Didn't you need her up front for
the carpool lane?

CLAUDE
«+. Right.

He opens the passenger door and the guys put her in. Quentin
extends his hand.

QUENTIN
Best of luck with everything.

CLAUDE
... Thank you.

Claude gets in the car and drives off. They wave goodbye.

QUENTIN
I liked Claude. He was relatable.
29.

MAX
(realizing)
Dammit! We should’ve asked him for
a ride to the mall.

OVER DEMI LOVATO’S “CONFIDENT”:

EXT. FABRIZIO’S HOUSE - LATER

The garage OPENS and the boys step out, rolling out a woman’s
bike and a seven year old girl’s bike.

QUICK CUTS:

-- The boys apply liberal amounts of sunblock to any exposed
skin. They help each other apply lotion to their necks.

-- Velcro straps are fastened around ELBOW PADS.
-- HELMET straps are tightened.

-- Water bottles are inserted into water bottle slots ina
backpack.

-- X-Ray clips on a REFLECTOR VEST.
CHYRON: TWENTY MINUTES LATER
They’re about to set off.
QUENTIN
(checks watch)
Come on, come on! We’re behind

schedule.

Max runs back into the garage and comes out with the
PAINTBALL GUN.

X-RAY
Why are you bringing that?
MAX
You never know... if the girls come

at us...

(holds up gun)
We can bribe them with this to let
us go. Everyone loves paintball
guns.

Quentin holds the little pink bike.
30.

QUENTIN
I’m not riding this. It can’t fit
my balls.
(then, to X-Ray)
Switch.

Quentin takes X-Ray’s bike. Max leans over to X-Ray.

MAX

You gotta stand up for yourself.
X-RAY

It’s fine...
FABRIZIO (0.S.)

Let's a’go!

They look over to see Fabrizio. He’s riding a road bike with
clip-ons.

They pull out onto the street. Max sees Quentin isn’t wearing
his helmet.

MAX
Quentin, put on your helmet! We’re
going on a main street!

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Hannah sits in math class, bored. A MATH TEACHER motions to a
right triangle on the board.

MATH TEACHER
So if side “A” is 4, and side “B”
is 9, what is the length of the
hypotenuse?

Everyone is silent. Hannah looks up, notices Lily in the
little window in the classroom door. Hannah raises her hand.

MATH TEACHER (CONT'D)
Hannah! Give it a go, girl!

HANNAH
May I go to the bathroom?

MATH TEACHER
("why do I bother?”)
Take a pass.
31.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lily holds out her phone to Hannah and Jaslyn, who’s also
joined. A map with a blinking, moving cursor is on the screen.

LILY
I put on “Find Your iPhone.”

CLOSE ON
A map with a blinking, moving cursor on the screen.
HANNAH
That little shit left school. Where
is he going in the middle of a
school day?

LILY
Maybe they’re going to the cops.

JASLYN
Now I think we need to call Jordy.

HANNAH
No, we just need to find them
before Jordy finds out the molly’s
missing.
JASLYN
(staring at phone)
Where are they going?
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

The boys bike down an empty street, laughing and smiling.
They try to bike with no hands. This is freedom.

QUICK CUTS:

-- They unsuccessfully try to pull wheelies, jump curbs,
bunny-hop, etc.

-- The boys bike through a SPRINKLER, legs outstretched.
-- A dog runs up to the edge of a fence and BARKS at them.
The boys, startled, speed off, laughing. Pure joy.

EXT. CANOGA AVENUE - LATER

The boys walk their bikes through a cross-walk.
32.

MAX
«+. Did you know a blow job and
oral sex are the same thing?

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROSCOE BOULEVARD - LATER
The boys are stopped at a red light.

X-RAY
«+. Jeremy Renner is the best Jason
Bourne. He’s Hawkeye. Matt Damon
was only good in “We Bought a Zoo.”

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DEVONSHIRE STREET - LATER
The boys try getting air off a speed bump.

QUENTIN
... You know who’s gotten really
good at comebacks? Atticus L.

EXT. WHITE OAK AVENUE - LATER

The boys have stopped to rest. Max drinks from a water
bottle, passes it to the others.

A PICKUP TRUCK pulling a COVERED TRAILER slows to a stop.
Emblazoned on the side is “MONSTER ENERGY DRINK: UNLEASH THE
BEAST.”

Through a fenced-in window on the side of the trailer, TWO
YELLOW EYES appear.

FABRIZIO
Whoa!

QUENTIN
What is it?
(calling to Driver)
What do you have back there?

The Pick-Up Driver ignores the boys as he turns onto the
congested 101 on-ramp.

X-RAY
I wonder what was back there.
33.

MAX
Hey, doesn’t it feel like we’ve
been biking forever? How much
longer?

X-Ray checks his Apple Watch.

X-RAY
Seventeen minutes away.
MAX
That makes no sense. How far have

we gone?
Fabrizio checks his Fitbit.

FABRIZIO
180 calories.

MAX
No, in steps!

FABRIZIO
(pushes a button)
3144.

MAX
Let me see your watch.

Max looks at X-Ray’s GPS app.

MAX (CONT'D)
You put it in for car, not for a
bike!

He types.

MAX (CONT'D)
We’re an hour and a half away --
and that’s just one way.

This hits them like a ton of bricks.

MAX (CONT'D)

There’s no way we’re gonna be back
by the end of lunch. They’re gonna
know we‘re gone.

QUENTIN
If we get caught, they won’t let us
sing in the recital.

X-RAY
Quentin, you have Uber.
34.

QUENTIN
No way! It goes straight to my
dad’s phone. He’1l know.

FABRIZIO
We're a’fucked.

MAX
Forget the recital --

QUENTIN
FORGET THE RECITAL?? Did you forget
we have a duet?!

MAX
I didn’t mean, like, “forget about
the recital.” I mean, if we don’t
get that drone back, the next time
we see X-Ray, his face will be
covered in jizz.

X-RAY
What?? Why?

QUENTIN
Matt Chestnut told Aiden Price that
at Camden Academy, the eighth
graders jerk off on the seventh
graders’ faces. And if you don’t
say “Thank you,” they punch you in
the nuts.

X-Ray puts his head in his hands. Max puts his arm around
him.

MAX
Don’t worry, it’s probably just a
stupid rumor.

Quentin shakes his head at Max and Fabrizio like, “No, that’s
real.”

QUENTIN
Also, I heard they make everyone
shower after gym and the older kids
will punch you in the nuts if you
don’t have pubes.

MAX
Quentin!

QUENTIN
Well, hopefully, it won’t get to
that.
35.

X-RAY
How do we even make up time? I’m
pedaling as fast as I can.

FABRIZIO
(looking at phone)
I find shortcut.

I/E. LILY’S MINI COOPER - DAY

Top down. The radio plays. Jaslyn checks the “Find Your
iPhone” app.

LILY
He should be pretty close.
(then)
Turn right here.
She points to the 101 freeway on-ramp.
LILY (CONT'D)
I haven't driven on the freeway
without my dad.
Hannah rolls her eyes.

LILY (CONT'D)
Don’t roll your eyes at me!

HANNAH
I wasn’t. I was rolling my eyes at
the situation.

EXT. THE 101 - SAME

Bumper to bumper traffic. Cars honk. On the edge of the
southbound side --

MAX, QUENTIN, X-RAY, and FABRIZIO.

X-RAY
This is genius.

FABRIZIO
Grazie.

The boys step onto the FREEWAY and weave their way through
the gridlock.

DRIVERS poke their heads out of the car, shocked to see
twelve year olds on bikes crossing a major freeway.
36.
FEMALE DRIVER
Guys, get back to the side!

OLDER DRIVER
Are you crazy?!

QUENTIN
Eat my balls!

The Older Driver shakes his head as the boys reach the
MEDIAN.

ON LILY’S MINI COOPER stuck in traffic.
LILY
I don’t get it. It says we're,
like, on top of him.
JASLYN
(pointing)
There!
She points to the boys CROSSING the freeway.
LILY
Take the next exit and turn around!
We'll catch them on the shoulder!
ANGLE ON

The boys make their way to the MEDIAN. The northbound traffic
is still crawling along. The guys celebrate.

QUENTIN
(pointing)
Guys! Check it out! Celebrity
sighting!
They all look in the direction they just came from.

MAX
Holy shit...

TURN TO REVEAL
A blue and red eighteen wheel truck.

MAX/FABRIZIO
OPTIMUS PRIME!!

QUENTIN
I guarantee that’s the real one.
37.

X-RAY
Why would Optimus Prime have a
human driver? That makes no sense.

MAX
To throw off the Decepticons.

FABRIZIO
The Decepticons can a’lick my
asshole.

MAX
They just want to get home.

They all motion for the driver to honk his air horn, raising
and lowering their arms feverishly.

The DRIVER notices them, rolls down his window.

TRUCK DRIVER
What the fuck are you doing? Get
off the freeway!

BOYS
Blow your horn! Blow your horn!

The Driver shakes his head, then pulls on his air horn. The
boys explode in CHEERS and HIGH-FIVES.

MAX
Alright, we should keep going.

They turn around. The traffic has picked up. Cars now whiz by
at 70 MPH. The boys are startled by the sound of the zooming
cars.

MAX (CONT'D)
Fuck. What do we do?

X-RAY
We should go back.

They turn back to see that the southbound traffic has begun
moving as well.

X-RAY (CONT'D)
We're trapped!

Cars speed past them on both sides. Drivers honk and point.

QUENTIN
(nervous )
We're not trapped. We just need to
time it.
38.
FABRIZIO
Is like video game.
They nod. They stare at the traffic, trying to time it, then --

QUENTIN
Now!

Max, Quentin and Fabrizio pedal furiously across the freeway
amid the sounds of long honks and screeching brakes.

They make it across, followed closely by X-Ray, who RUNS WITH
HIS BIKE BESIDE HIM.

As he makes it to the safety of the shoulder, an SUV hits the
BACK WHEEL of his bike, sending it FLYING into an --

ONCOMING PRIUS.

The boys watch in horror as the Prius BRAKES to avoid the
FLYING BICYCLE, which causes --

The Monster Energy Drink TRUCK to SWERVE --

FLIPPING the hitched trailer onto its side. Sparks fly as it
rear-ends the Prius, which pancakes into the SUV. The
battered rear door of the trailer hangs from a hinge.

Cars behind them slam on the brakes, but it’s too late. Each
car SMASHES the one in front.

ON THE BOYS
Staring, slack-jawed.

MAX
We should go.

They hastily pull their bikes up the embankment.

ON THE FREEWAY

DRIVERS step out of their cars to survey the damage.
ANGLE ON

Claude and Peaches (the sex doll), now in the carpool lane.
Claude sighs, stares out the windshield at the gridlock.

CLAUDE
Come on!!

ON LILY’S MINI
39.
Now stopped in the gridlock. Hannah stands on her seat to get
a better view.
HANNAH

There's a trailer flipped on its

side. We’re gonna be here forever.
ON THE TRAILER
The crumpled rear door swings OPEN --

And the two yellow eyes EMERGE from the darkness.

They belong to a LION who surveys the unfamiliar surroundings
and lets out a mighty ROAR.

The Pick-Up Driver hops out of the cab, sees the lion, and
immediately hops back in and locks his door.

THE LION

In predator mode, the beast stalks its way through the
gridlock.

CLICK CLICK CLICK. In rapid succession, automatic locks snap
closed.

ON LILY’S MINI

Not moving. Jaslyn stands up on her seat to get a better
look. She immediately drops back down.

JASLYN
Close the top. Now. Right now!

The Lion emerges from between two cars and stops, studying
Lily’s convertible. It ROARS.

GIRLS
Abhh!!!

Lily slams the button to close the roof.
VRRRRRRR..-
The convertible roof motor slowly whirs to life.

It feels like an eternity. People watch from the safety of
their own cars.

LILY
Come on!
40.

JASLYN
Push harder!

HANNAH
This is as fast as it fucking goes,
Jaslyn!!

The Lion jumps onto the hood and lets out a ROAR.

GIRLS
AHHHHHH!

The Girls scream in terror, but that doesn’t stop Jaslyn from
pulling out her phone to record.

She turns the phone on herself and immediately makes a pouty
face as she continues to scream.

The Lion makes its way up the hood, putting its enormous paws
on the windshield. A single sheet of glass now separates
them.

It takes another step, just as the ROOF LOCKS INTO PLACE.

It crawls onto the roof, which begins to BUCKLE and jumps
off, disappearing between the stopped cars.

JASLYN
(into camera phone)
I am in shock. I almost just --

She lowers the phone, fixes her hair, and starts over.

JASLYN (CONT'D)
I am in shock. I almost just died.

Suddenly, they HEAR an earth-shattering SCREAM. The whip
around to see --

THE LION VIOLENTLY PULLING a WOMAN THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW OF
A PASSENGER SEAT.

It’s horrific.

Fortunately, it’s not a woman. It’s Peaches (the sex doll).
Claude desperately holds onto her by her legs.

CLAUDE
(to Lion)
No! Stop it! Bad!

The Lion tears Peaches’ head off and stalks away. It passes
Hannah's car with the head in his mouth. The girls let out a
blood-curdling scream.
41.

BACK ON CLAUDE

Staring at the headless doll. He opens the front of her
dress, making sure everything is intact. Breathes a sigh of
relief.

CLAUDE (CONT'D)
That could’ve been bad.

CUT TO:

EXT. VANOWEN STREET - LATER

Small shops and restaurants. The boys pedal furiously,
weaving in and out of pedestrian traffic.

X-Ray checks his watch.

X-RAY
We’re almost there --
(then)
Nope. Still in car mode.

Up ahead, a large demonstration blocks their path. PROTESTORS
hold signs and chant outside of a PLANNED PARENTHOOD. As the

boys get nearer, they make out the signs -- “I CHOOSE LIFE”;

“BABIES MURDERED HERE.”

QUENTIN
We need to get around this
nonsense.

A sweet-looking girl, WILLA, and a guy with a wispy goatee in
a faded “Mike Huckabee for President” t-shirt, GIDEON,
approach them, holding some pamphlets.

WILLA
Excuse me, can we have a minute of
your time?

MAX
«+. Okay.

GIDEON
Do you think that murdering babies
is wrong?

X-RAY
Of course. The murder of anyone is
wrong.
42.

GIDEON
What if I told you doctors were
killing babies?

BOYS
WHAT?!

GIDEON
(handing a pamphlet)
Read the literature. Why do you
think we're here?

MAX
(shrugs)
I thought maybe you were unemployed?

GIDEON
I’m a screenwriter.

QUENTIN
Nice, where are you repped? My
dad’s an agent at Don Buchwald and
Associates.

GIDEON
«+. I’m waiting to hear back on
some query letters.

QUENTIN
You know, if you get a manager,
they can help you get an agent.

WILLA
(jumping in)
So guys, we’re trying to recruit
more cool, young people to our
movement. Come protest with us!

X-RAY
We can’t. We have to get to the
mall.

WILLA

Come on, guys. You don’t really
think the mall is more important
than a human life.

FABRIZIO
Uno minuto, please.

The guys huddle up.
43.

FABRIZIO (CONT'D)
We need to a’help. Doctors are
a’killing babies. If a’not us, who?
If a’not now, when?

QUENTIN
This is our community we’re talking
about. Who are these doctors?! How
is this not in the news?!

MAX
We don’t know if it’s our community
or a different community.

X-RAY
Guys, maybe we can get on a mailing
list and help, but right now we
need to get to the mall!

MAX
X-Ray’s right.

Max turns to Willa and Gideon.

MAX (CONT'D)
You guys seem like really good
people, but we need to be back at
school before lunch ends or we’1l
get caught for ditching.

WILLA
Tell you what: let us take a few
pictures of you holding up signs
for our email blast and we’ll call
your school and pretend to be your
parents.

GIDEON
And then we'll drive you to the
mall. How’s that sound?

The boys light up -- all their problems are solved.

EXT. PLANNED PARENTHOOD - LATER

The boys watch as Gideon finishes up a phone call. He cups
the phone to drown out the noise of the protest.

GIDEON
(into phone)
«+. I will definitely make sure to
sign them out with you next time.
Okay, you, too.
44,

Gideon hangs up, turns to the guys.

GIDEON (CONT'D)
Okay, now you have to hold up your
end...

The boys enthusiastically raise signs and protest
aggressively.

BOYS
MURDERERS! MURDERERS !

ANGLE ON
The front of the protest. Willa speaks through a MEGAPHONE.

WILLA

Our movement is growing stronger
every day. And we will be here for
years to come. How do I know?
Because I’ve seen the future. And
it’s right here.

(then, to boys)
Come up here, guys.

The Protestors part to make a path. The boys, surprised, walk
uncertainly toward the front as the Protestors applaud them.

WILLA (CONT’D)
These guys get it.
(then, to boys)
I want you to tell this crowd what
you told me.

She hands the megaphone to Max, but Quentin snatches it away.

QUENTIN
Hello, Los Angeles!

The crowd hoots and hollers. Quentin loves the adulation.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)

Thank you. Thank you, friends.
(then)

We were on our way to the Fashion

Square mall when we were stopped

and told that doctors were killing

babies. And that ends now.

The crowds ERUPTS. Quentin begins pacing back and forth,
really getting into it.
45.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
So what do we do? Do we need to
give these babies guns?

The crowd loves this idea. Shouts of “YES!” A DOCTOR hustles
past the crowd toward the clinic entrance. Max takes the
megaphone.

MAX
(to Doctor)
You! A murder!

The Doctor enters.

MAX (CONT'D)
I don’t understand! Why isn’t he in
jail?

The crowd cheers.

MAX (CONT'D)
No. Really, why? I don’t get it.

GIDEON
Because we live in a world where
the Supreme Court says it’s okay
for a woman kill her unborn child!
(then, to crowd)
End abortion now!

Max lowers the megaphone. The boys look at each other.

X-RAY
What in the ass?

MAX
(confused)
Wait, wait, wait. Abortions are for
fetuses. You said babies.

QUENTIN
Yeah, my dads say that fetuses are
just cells.

WILLA
Fetuses are babies!

QUENTIN
(realizing)
Are you anti-abortion?
(then, to the other boys)
I think they’re anti-abortion!
46.
WILLA
We're pro-life!
The boys gasp.
QUENTIN
You don’t believe in a woman’s

right to choose?!?!

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. VANOWEN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Willa and Gideon toss their bikes to the ground.

GIDEON
Good luck not going up in hell!

QUENTIN
Good luck getting a response to
those query letters!

EXT. SHERMAN OAKS STREET - DAY

The Boys struggle up a steep hill except for Quentin, who
stands on Max’s pegs. X-Ray rides Quentin’s bike.

QUENTIN

I’m starving. We should get lunch.
INT. YOGURTLAND - DAY
OVER BEETHOVEN'S “SYMPHONY IN A MAJOR” --
CLOSE ON
A YOGURT spout as it fills a cup. And keeps filling and
filling. Quentin laughs in delight as the yogurt spills over
the side.

X-Ray lovingly ladles hot fudge onto his towering mound of
yogurt.

Max scoops every topping imaginable onto his. He reaches a
beautiful fruit section. He grimaces -- “gross” -- and walks
right past it.

Fabrizio puts his head under the spout and lets the yogurt
spill into his mouth. The middle-aged CASHIER sees him.
47.

CASHIER
(calling out)
Hey! Stop that!
FABRIZIO
What? What I do?
INT. YOGURTLAND - LATER
CLOSE ON TV

A Helicopter POV of the now-shut down 101. Cars are backed up
for miles.

CAPTION: Escaped Lion Decapitates Sex Doll, Shuts Down 101.

The boys are now seated and messily eating from their
overflowing bowls, completely oblivious.

X-RAY
Hey, Quentin, guess what?

QUENTIN
What?

X-Ray FARTS. The others laugh. A SENIOR CITIZEN COUPLE looks
over, disgusted. They get up from the table.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
Tonight is going to be so sweet.

Quentin FARTS.
QUENTIN (CONT'D)
Performing. And then we can have a
sleepover.

FABRIZIO
Sick.

QUENTIN
It’s almost literally a perfect
night.
Max looks down guiltily.
The CASHIER approaches their table.

CASHIER
Guys, you have to stop --

He suddenly recoils from the smell.
48.

CASHIER (CONT'D)
Ugh. You have to stop farting.
People are complaining.

X-RAY
That wasn’t us.

MAX
Yeah, I think it was those old
people that just left.

The Cashier rolls his eyes and begins to walk away. Fabrizio
releases a long, thin, slide-whistle FART.

The Cashier whips around.
CASHIER
Okay, that’s it. You’re gone.
EXT. YOGURT LAND - DAY
The boys cross the parking lot.

QUENTIN
He was outlandish!

X-RAY
What does that word mean?

QUENTIN
I can’t describe it. I can just use
it in a sentence.

X-RAY
Okay. Gimme the sentence.

QUENTIN
I already said it! “He was
outlandish!” I can’t be any
clearer.

They reach the bike rack. Lily’s Mini is waiting for them.

LILY

Hey, cuties. Miss us?
MAX

«+. No.
HANNAH

Just give me back my bag. I need my
phone and all my shit.
49,

MAX
Not until you give us the code to
your phone so we can delete the
pictures.

HANNAH
No! I have private texts and
pictures of family members!

JASLYN
Just give us the fucking bag.

QUENTIN
No!!

Hannah starts to open her door.

X-RAY
(panicked)
If you get out of the car, I’1l
scream.

The Girls roll their eyes.

LILY
If you don’t give us the bag, we'll
tell everyone at your school that
you’re homophobes.

FABRIZIO
(re Quentin)
His dads are gay!

QUENTIN
So lick my balls.
JASLYN
Fine, we'll say you’re racist.
X-RAY
No!
QUENTIN

I‘1l sue you for libel and take
your parent’s house, darling!

HANNAH
Okay, fuck this.

Hannah throws opens her door, when --

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
Hey!
50.

Hannah and the girls and our boys all look up to see a BIKE
COP approaching.

BIKE COP
Boys!

The Girls realize the Cop is addressing the Boys. They
quickly drive away.

BIKE COP (CONT'D)
Any reason you guys aren't in
school?

X-RAY
We go to a Jewish day school and
today’s a Jewish holiday.

BIKE COP
Oh, okay, gotcha.

The Bike Cop begins to pedal away.

QUENTIN
(calling out, politely)
Excuse me, Cop?

The Bike Cop looks up.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
There are some sketchy girls ina
Mini Cooper that were making anti-
semitic remarks and made us feel
unsafe.

MAX
Can you let the police know so
they’1l stop?

BIKE COP
I am the police.

X-RAY
No, like the ones with cars and
guns.

QUENTIN
And pants.
(then, helpful)
The real police.

BIKE COP
(annoyed)
I am the real police. I’1l talk to
the girls.
51.

X-RAY
Wait, I have a question. What’s
next? Do you become a horse cop and
then you get a car?

QUENTIN
Duh. It goes walking cop, bike cop,
horse cop.
(then)
Do you know anyone in SWAT?

FABRIZIO
Or a Navy SEAL?

MAX
Are you allowed to wear pants if
it’s raining?

The Bike Cop shakes his head and bikes off.
QUENTIN

What an asshole. He didn’t answer
any of our questions.

X-RAY
He’s probably upset because he
doesn’t have a car.

I/E. JASLYN’S CAR - DAY
Jaslyn drives.
LILY
If they narc’d on us, I’1l kill
them.

Lily’s phone BUZZES.

LILY (CONT'D)
It’s Jordy.

Jaslyn pulls up to a red light. Lily reads the text.

LILY (CONT'D)
(reading)
“Call me.” All caps.

JASLYN
Fuck! How are we supposed to
explain that a bunch of little kids
stole the Molly?
52.

HANNAH
Jordy’s Molly.
(then, correcting)
Six thousand bucks worth of Jordy’s
Molly. We are so fucked.

The Bike Cop pulls up next to them, KNOCKS on their window.
The Girls jump and SCREAM.

EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - LATER

Our boys, sweaty and tired, bike down the sidewalk of the
busy thoroughfare. They round a corner -- and then, like an
oasis in the desert -- they see --

The Fashion Square Mall.

MAX
We made it!

They cheer. High-fives all around.

EXT. MAGNOLIA BOULEVARD - DAY

The Bike Cop approaches Hannah’s car. Hannah rolls down her
window. Her eyes are welling up.

HANNAH
(choking back tears)
Am I in trouble?

The Bike Cop sighs.

BIKE COP
You don’t need to cry... What are
you girls doing out of school?

Lily leans over from the passenger seat. She’s crying, too.

LILY
(tearing up)
We have off-campus lunch
privileges.

From the back, also crying --

JASLYN
We're upperclassmen.

BIKE COP
(annoyed)
Seriously. Cut it with the crying.
53.

They all stop crying.

BIKE COP (CONT’D)
Second, stop harassing those kids.

HANNAH
They were harassing us!

BIKE COP
I don’t care! Be role models. Those
little boys look up to you.

LILY
Yes, sir.

HANNAH
That's really inspiring.

BIKE COP
Jesus Christ. Just go back to
school.
The Bike Cop walks off. Hannah turns to the others.

HANNAH
Call Jordy.

CUT TO:

EXT. TUJUNGA AVENUE - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

Lily’s Mini has pulled over, hazards flashing. A hulking Ford
F-150 with an illegal tint job pulls up behind them. They
tense, nervously awaiting their fate.

TRUCK NUTZ dangle from the back bumper.

The front door of the pickup opens, revealing a TATTOOED
HAND. A combat boot steps out.

HANNAH
(nervous )
Hey, Jordy.
TURN TO REVEAL
JORDY, 18 -- and she’s not happy. Inked up from her hands to

her neck. Dressed like Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider, tassled
suede jacket, ripped jeans.

LILY
(whispers)
Why does she dress like that?
54.

HANNAH
(whispers)
She went on “23 and Me” and found
out she’s one-sixteenth Apache.

Jordy stares the girls down. There’s a menace to her.

JORDY
I had to leave anger management
early to deal with this shit.
(then)
Hannah, come here.

Hannah doesn’t move.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Come here. I’m not gonna hurt you.
(then)

Once blood, always blood.

Hannah reluctantly walks over to Jordy.

JORDY (CONT'D)

And if your cunt dad hadn't
divorced my mom, we’d still be
sisters.

HANNAH
(nervous )
I still think of you as a sister.

A Minivan pulls up to a red light. The passenger window rolls
down. RAFI is playing. A little girl sits in a car seat. A
SUBURBAN DAD calls through the window:

SUBURBAN DAD
If you’re going to park here, you
should put on your hazards.

GIRLS
Okay, sorry. / We're moving.

JORDY
Don’t come at me.

SUBURBAN DAD
I was just saying, this is a really
busy street and the cars fly by.

Jordy takes a step toward his car.
55.

JORDY
You keep coming for me, but I
didn’t send for you. So don’t tell
me where I can stand, bitch.

The girls exchange a look -- Jordy'’s crazy.

Scared, he rolls up his window and stares straight ahead. The
light turns GREEN and the minivan PEELS OUT.

LILY
Hey, Jordy, we need to get back to
school, so...
JORDY
(dismissive)
Yeah, that’s not gonna happen.
Hannah rides with me.

INT. FASHION SQUARE MALL - CONTINUOUS

Your basic suburban mall. Muzak. Fountains. Food court.
Fluorescent lighting. Pac Sun. Lids. GNC. Aldo. Starbucks.
Starbucks-To-Go.

The doors automatically open and our boys step in.

They made it.

INT. FASHION SQUARE MALL - DAY

Max, Quentin, X-Ray and Fabrizio race up the escalator,
pushing past shoppers.

INT. BROOKSTONE - DAY
It’s mostly electric corkscrews and towel warmers.

Fabrizio plays with an electric corkscrew as the others
approach the check-out counter. The Brookstone SALESMAN, 35,
with thinning hair and goatee, looks up.

MAX
Hi. I called about the Phantom 3
Standard Quadcopter drone.

SALESMAN
I spoke to a woman.

MAX
That was me.
56.

SALESMAN
Oh. Well, we sold it.

X-RAY
What?! No!

SALESMAN

Oh yeah, just sold the last one.
Like, ten minutes ago.

The boys are shell-shocked. The Salesman laughs.

SALESMAN (CONT'D)
I’M JUST FUCKING WITH YOU, BRO.

He pulls it out from underneath the counter. They breathe a
sigh of relief.

SALESMAN (CONT'D)
Now, do you guys want the three
year warranty?

They hadn't considered this.

X-RAY
Do we need it?

SALESMAN
It’s piece of mind. It’s
protection. It’s a condom.

MAX
Oh okay, thanks.

In the b.g., Fabrizio sits in a vibrating massage chair.

SALESMAN
Very smart. And do you guys want
the guarantee?

QUENTIN
What about the warranty?

SALESMAN
The warranty’s great, but it
doesn’t cover everything. The
guarantee covers the rest.

X-RAY
(glancing at others)
Uh, okay.
57.

SALESMAN
Alright, we’re all set. Oh, wait. I
forgot the most important one: do
you want Brookstone Care?

QUENTIN
Do we need it?

SALESMAN
Do you travel internationally?

MAX
What?

Fabrizio flips over in the chair so that the front of his
body is pressed into the chair.

SALESMAN

Look, say you’re with your parents
in Spain and they start fighting in
some tapas restaurant. You’re like,
fuck it, I don’t need this. And you
go outside to play with your drone.
And then you fly the thing into a
thousand year old church. Hey,
that’s cool, I’ve got a warranty
and a guarantee, life is good...

(buzzer sound)
Ehhhh! Here’s what you don’t know.
The warranty and guarantee are only
good in the continental United
States and some parts of Canada.
Brookstone Care is worldwide. So
should I throw it in or do you want
to be fucked in Europe?

QUENTIN
«+. Okay. Let’s take it, just to be
safe.

Fabrizio is now straddling the chair, his legs dangling over
the arms. He’s really working the chair.

SALESMAN
Very smart. How old are you guys?
Eight? Nine?

QUENTIN X-RAY
Twelve and a half. Almost thirteen.

SALESMAN
Exactly, so I was in the range.

The Salesman rings up the drone.
58.

SALESMAN (CONT'D)
Okay, the drone is five-fifty and
then another three-twenty for the
protection plans, et cetera...
that’1l be... nine hundred nine
dollars and eighty-eight cents.

MAX
We only have enough money for the
drone.

SALESMAN

Why’d you let me go on about the
protection plans? I’ve got shit to
do. Fuck.

The Salesman removes the warranties from the price.

SALESMAN (CONT'D)
Five eighty-two and eighty-eight

cents.
MAX

No, just the drone.
SALESMAN

That is just the drone.
MAX

The drone is five-fifty.
SALESMAN

And tax. Are you familiar with tax?
X-RAY

Yeah, but we call them push pins.
SALESMAN

Sales tax! Jesus.
MAX

But this is all we have.
SALESMAN

Can’t help you.
QUENTIN

(re X-Ray)

Look, if we don’t get that drone,
his dad is going to kill him. He’s
crazy. He drinks wine every night.
And he once screamed at me for
going into his music memorabilia
room without permission.
59.

SALESMAN
This is my business...
MAX
Whoa, you’re Brookstone?
SALESMAN
Just... come back when you have
thirty-eight dollars or don’t come

back.
(then, noticing Fabrizio)
Hey, stop fucking the chair!

INT. FASHION SQUARE MALL - SECOND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
The boys stand dejectedly outside of Brookstone.

X-RAY
Fucking taxes. Now I get why my dad
hates paying them.

The other guys try to comfort him, but are clearly distracted
by something just off-screen.

QUENTIN
(glancing off)
We'll figure it out. There has to
be, um, a way of, um, the money.

MAX
(glancing off)
Yeah, um, your dad and, um, the

FABRIZIO
(staring)
Yes. Suck it, baby.

WIDEN TO REVEAL

A YOUNG MOTHER BREASTFEEDING ON A BENCH a few feet away. She
notices them staring at her.

YOUNG MOTHER
Can I help you?

QUENTIN
We just think your baby is
adorable.

The Young Mother rolls her eyes.
60.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
She would make so much money if she
charged for that.

X-RAY
I wish I had breasts. We’d get the
money so fast.

MAX
Wait, we have something better than
breasts.

CUT TO:

INT. FASHION SQUARE MALL - FOOD COURT - LATER

Half full. RETIREES read newspapers and eat alone. MALL
EMPLOYEES on lunch break. Tired MOTHERS contend with restless
children.

CLOSE ON QUENTIN

QUENTIN
(counting off)
A one, a two, a one two three...

CLOSE ON MAX

As he belts out the first lines of ADELE’s “Rolling in the
Deep” in an angelic falsetto.

MAX
(singing)
There’s a fire / starting in my
heart / Reaching a fever pitch / it
is bringing me out the dark...

Customers slowly look up from their food to find --

Fabrizio standing ON TOP OF A TABLE and singing his heart
out. He sings in perfect English.

FABRIZIO
(singing)
Finally I can see you crystal clear
/ Go ahead and sell me out and I’1l
lay your shit bare.

ANGLE ON
Max and Quentin, at the next table over. They begin

rhythmically pounding their fists onto the table, providing a
back beat.
61.

FABRIZIO (CONT'D)
(singing)

The scars of your love remind me of

us / They keep me thinking that we

almost had it all.

Fabrizio walks over to a SIX-YEAR OLD sitting with his mother
and musses his hair. The boy pushes Fabrizio away, who
continues to perform.

FABRIZIO (CONT'D)
(singing)

The scars of your love, they leave

me breathless / I can’t help

feeling...

ANGLE ON

The ESCALATOR. X-Ray RIDES down the bannister. At the bottom,
he jump off and dance-jogs into the Food Court. He joins
Fabrizio in the chorus.

FABRIZIO/MAX
(singing)
We could have had it allllllll.

Max and Quentin jump on their table and sing backup. Quentin
accidentally steps on an OLD MAN’s burrito.

MAX/QUENTIN
(singing backup)
You're gonna wish you never had met
me.

FABRIZIO/X-RAY
(singing)
Rolling in the deee-eeep.

MAX/QUENTIN
(singing backup)
Tears are gonna fall/rolling in the
deep.

FABRIZIO/X-RAY
(singing)
You had my heart inside of your
hand.

Max and Quentin grab two ORANGE TRAFFIC CONES nearby and sing
through them, like two synchronized trumpeters.

The Guys are way more into it than the Shoppers, although a
few mouth the words.
62.

SHOPPER
(singing along)
You're gonna wish --

Quentin immediately shushes her.

X-RAY/FABRIZIO
You're gonna wish you never had met
me.

Max comes over to Quentin and they sing to each other,
beaming, their faces just inches away.

MAX/QUENTIN
(singing)
And you played it to the beat.

A female SECURITY GUARD comes over. Instead of stopping, the
boys immediately surround her, dancing and singing, trying to
incorporate her in to the show.

SECURITY GUARD
Wrap it up, children.

BOYS
(singing)
We could’ve had it allll1l1ll.

X-Ray and Fabrizio grab squeeze bottles off of a table,
sending streams of ketchup and mustard into the air.

ANGLE ON
A stone-faced JANITOR watching.
The boys all clasp hands and bow deeply. Shoppers APPLAUD.
MAX
Thank you! If you enjoyed today’s
performance, please donate.
QUENTIN
And there are still seats available
for our winter recital tonight at
John Adams Middle School. God
bless.

The boys take their bike helmets and go table to table
soliciting money.

FABRIZIO
Grazie! Grazie!

CUT TO:
63.

INT. FASHION SQUARE MALL - MOMENTS LATER

The boys exit Brookstone, triumphant. X-Ray holds the large
Drone box over his head. They’re in high spirits.

X-RAY
Max, that was so genius. You don’t
even understand -- you saved my
life.

MAX

I can’t believe we still remembered
the routine from Sing Camp.

QUENTIN
That song is so old. It came out
when we were six!

WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
Max?

They look up to see a SUBURBAN MOTHER, early 40s, dressed in
workout clothes.

SUBURBAN MOTHER
What are you doing here? Shouldn't
you guys be in school?

They all look caught. This is really bad, then --

MAX
«+. My grandmother died.

SUBURBAN MOTHER
Oh my god! I’m so sorry.

MAX
She was murdered by a mugger in
Ottawa.

SUBURBAN MOTHER
That’s horrible!
(then)
So what are you doing here?

FABRIZIO
It’s a Jewish Holiday.

Max puts his arm on Fabrizio’s shoulder to quiet him.

MAX
My mom took us out of school. We
were all close to her.

(MORE )
64.

MAX (CONT'D)
And my grandmother loved malls, so
we came here.

The Woman nods, taking this in.

SUBURBAN MOTHER
(looking around)
Where’s your mom?

MAX
She's on the phone with the Ottawa
Police.

QUENTIN

No leads yet.

SUBURBAN MOTHER
Well, tell her how sorry I am and
that I’m thinking of her.

MAX
I will.

SUBURBAN MOTHER
(squeezes his shoulder)
And if you don’t want to come to
Soren’s birthday tonight, I’m sure
he’1l understand.
(then, to others)
Bye, guys.

She walks off. Max returns to the others, who are clearly

annoyed.

X-RAY
You're invited to Soren’s party?
When were you going to tell us?

MAX
I wasn’t going for sure.

X-RAY
Sounded like you were going.

QUENTIN
What’s that erratic piece of shit
doing this year? Did his dad rent
puppies again?

MAX
.-. It’s a kissing party.

FABRIZIO
Fuuuuuuck.
65.

QUENTIN
(covering)
No, no, it’s cool. You can finally
join the kissing club. Took you
long enough.
FABRIZIO
Girls a’love it when you lick the
back of their teeth.
EXT. WESTFIELD FASHION SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
The boys exit the mall.

X-RAY
It makes them wet.

MAX
Gross. Why?

X-RAY
I think from sweat.

Fabrizio sees something over Max’s shoulder. His eyes go
wide.

FABRIZIO
They a’found us!

The guys look over to see Lily’s MINI charging right at them.
They take off running. X-Ray struggles to keep up while
holding onto the drone box.

I/E. LILY'S CAR - SAME

Lily drives.

JASLYN
Go! Go! Gol

Lily FLOORS it, then brakes abruptly.

JASLYN (CONT'D)
Speed bump.

ON THE BOYS

Running for their lives. Behind them, Lily continues to floor
it, brake, gingerly go over a speed bump, and repeat.

Quentin turns back to X-Ray.
66.

QUENTIN
X-Ray, come on!

X-RAY
The box is heavy! I’m running as
fast as I can!

Quentin runs back and helps X-Ray carry the box.

MAX
We need to find an adult!

Suddenly, a black PICKUP TRUCK screeches to a stop, almost
running them over. It’s JORDY.

JORDY
Hey, kiddos.

Jordy swings open her door, KNOCKING X-Ray and the drone to
the ground.

MAX
Run!

They grab X-Ray and take off into the PARKING STRUCTURE.

X-RAY
The drone! We have to go back for
it.

FABRIZIO

I don’t wanna die!
ANGLE ON JORDY

She picks up the drone box from the ground and smiles.

INT. MALL PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER

Jordy's truck slowly drives down the aisles looking for the
boys... They’re nowhere to be seen.

JORDY
(to herself)
Come here, little babies... Come to
mama...

Hannah scans the garage from the passenger window. Nothing.
They pass a MINIVAN and continue down the row.

A WOMAN approaches the mini-van, gets in, and drives off,
REVEALING --
67.

OUR BOYS LYING IN THE NOW-EMPTY PARKING SPOT.

They stand, covered in dirt, grease, and oil and scurry off
to a nearby stairwell, narrowly avoiding --

LILY’S MINI.

She pulls up alongside Jordy’s truck. Lily rolls down her
window.

LILY
They’re not on the third floor.

JORDY
We don’t need to find them. They’11
come to us.

INT. PARKING LOT STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

The “Pretty Little Liars” theme song PLAYS. Max pulls out
Hannah’s phone, checks the caller ID. It reads: CRAZY BITCH.

MAX
(to others)
It says “Crazy Bitch.”

QUENTIN
Answer it. It could be important.

Max answers. The others listen.

MAX
Hello?

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. JORDY’S TRUCK - SAME
Jordy speaks into her truck’s bluetooth.
JORDY
I’m gonna make this real simple:
give me my Molly back and I'll let
you get back to recess.
Max covers the phone, turns to the others.

MAX
Who’s Molly?

The boys shrug.
68.

MAX (CONT'D)
(confused)
We don’t have your friend.

JORDY
Molly is drugs. You have Hannah’s
bag, which has my drugs.

MAX
(eyes go wide)
Illegal drugs?

JORDY
Yes, you stupid fucking cunt!

MAX
(covering phone, to others)
I think she’s angry.

JORDY
Do you know who you’re talking to?

MAX
Umm, you came up as “Crazy Bitch”
on the phone...?

Jordy shoots Hannah a dirty look.

CLICK.

JORDY
Alright, here's what’s gonna
happen: there’s a playground on the
corner of Chandler and Van Nuys.
Meet me there in thirty minutes.
Call the cops and you’ll never see
your family again.

Quentin holds out his phone to the others.

QUENTIN
I just looked it up. Molly is a sex
drug. We’re dealing with
nymphomaniacs.

This rocks them to their core.

MAX
We've been carrying illegal drugs
the whole time and we didn’t even
know. We’re such idiots.

Max opens his bag, pushes the paintball gun aside and grabs
HANNAH'S BAG. He pulls out the FLINTSTONES PILL BOX.
69.
Quentin takes the pill container and tries to open it. He
struggles with the child seal.

FABRIZIO
Let me try.

Fabrizio bangs the pill box against the metal railing.

FABRIZIO (CONT'D)
Fuuuuck!

QUICK CUTS:

-- They all take turns trying to open the container.
-- X-Ray throws it against the wall.

-- Max tries using the edge of the step as a fulcrum.

CHYRON: 10 MINUTES LATER

INT. PARKING LOT STAIRWELL - LATER
An ELDERLY WOMAN opens the pill bottle for them.

ELDERLY WOMAN
You'll get nice and strong now.

BOYS
Thank you!

She walks off. Fabrizio’s about to pull one out when Quentin
stops him.

QUENTIN
Never touch drugs.

Fabrizio carefully dumps a pill onto his outstretched shirt.
On the pill is a SMILEY FACE EMOJI. They look relieved.

X-RAY
I thought it would look different.
FABRIZIO
What if they spread them into our
community?
QUENTIN

Well, we don’t know if it’s our
community or some other community.

MAX
What if it’s a trap?
70.

QUENTIN
You think everything’s a trap! It’s
a business transaction. They’re
businesswomen. If they fuck us,
we'll never do business with them
again.

MAX
I don’t like it.

QUENTIN
Like I care.

X-RAY
My dad’s probably on his way home.
We have to get the drone.

MAX
It’s too dangerous.

X-RAY
(snatches pill box)
I’m making the trade, with or
without you.

QUENTIN
I’m coming with you.

FABRIZIO
I come, too.

QUENTIN
(pointed, to Max)
Friends don’t leave friends behind.

Max shakes his head.

MAX
I’m coming. It’s just... drugs on a
playground... I hope there’s no
kids there.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PLAYGROUND - LATER
The boys sit on the swings, waiting. X-Ray checks his watch.

QUENTIN
(looking around)
This playground is sweet. We should
come back here.
MAX
Totally. Check out those monkey
bars.

QUENTIN

Wasn’t talking to you.

71.

Jordy’s truck and Lily’s Mini pull up. The girls exit the car
and approach. Lily holds the drone box. The boys tense.

JORDY
Strip.
MAX
(nervous )
What, why??
JORDY
How do I know you’re not wearing a
wire?

The boys are petrified. They look at one another and then
slowly unlace their sneakers. Fabrizio casually begins

undressing.

JORDY (CONT'D)
(laughs)
I’m just fucking with you.
(then, serious)
Give me my shit.

Max pulls Hannah’s bag from his backpack.

MAX
Same time.

X-Ray approaches Lily. Max walks over to Jordy.

MAX (CONT'D)
One, two --
JORDY
(snatching bag)
Just give me the bag.

Lily gives X-Ray the drone box.

Jordy looks through the bag, pulls out the pill box.

a shake.

JORDY (CONT'D)
Good boys.

Hannah takes the bag, rifles through it.

Gives it
72.

HANNAH
My phone’s not in here.

Quentin holds up the phone.

QUENTIN
That wasn’t part of the deal.

HANNAH
Look, I just want my phone back.
I‘1l delete your pictures. We
weren't really going to post them.

MAX
How do we know we can trust you?

HANNAH
I promise.

X-RAY
Do you pledge it?

HANNAH
What?
(then)
I'll delete them right in front of
you.

Quentin looks at the other boys. They nod. Quentin walks over
and hands the phone to Hannah. She opens her phone to REVEAL
the pictures of the BOYS DRESSED IN DRAG.

Jordy looks over and cackles. She snatches the phone from
Hannah and starts typing.

JORDY
I’m posting these.

BOYS
No!!

HANNAH
Jordy, don't... we were just
messing with them.

JORDY
Yeah, that’s what I’m doing...
And... posted.

Jordy tosses the phone back to Hannah.

JORDY (CONT'D)
And if you delete them, I’11l crush
your skull with my thighs.

(MORE )
73.

JORDY (CONT'D)
(then)
Let's go.

Hannah, Jaslyn, and Lily look back at our boys, whose eyes
start to well up.

QUENTIN
(holding tears back)
Hannah’s sister will re-post it to
her 40,000 followers.

MAX
(quiet, holding back tears)
Do not cry in front of the girls.
The girls mouth “sorry” and follow after Jordy. The boys are
desperately trying to hold back their tears. As soon as the
girls hop in the car, the flood gates open.

All four boys BURST INTO TEARS.

EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - DAY

The boys, still crying, pedal down the sidewalk in silence.
The drone box sits in the basket of Max's bike.

QUENTIN
My life is over.

FABRIZIO
I move back to Italy.

Something catches Max’s eye. He drops to the ground.

MAX
Hide!

The boys quickly duck down between two parked cars.

FABRIZIO
What now?

Max points across the street. They all turn to see X-Ray’s
Dad exiting a jewelry store with a small bag. He heads to a
parked car.

X-RAY
(panicked)
Shit.

QUENTIN
I don’t think he saw us.
74.

FABRIZIO
(relieved)
Okay, he’s leaving...

A YOUNG WOMAN exits the jewelry store and follows X-Ray’s Dad
to his car. She gets in.

QUENTIN
Who’s that woman?

X-RAY
It’s Dana. She works with my dad.

X-Ray’s Dad and the Woman share a passionate KISS in the car.
The boys watch, shell-shocked, as the car drives off.

They all fall silent. None of them know what to say. After a
beat --

QUENTIN
(quiet)
Maybe they’re just friends.

X-RAY
«+. I don’t want to talk about it.
QUENTIN
What are you going to tell your
mom?
MAX

He doesn’t want to talk about it.
QUENTIN
My best friend is going through a
crisis, so can you mind your own
business?
Quentin awkwardly puts his arm around X-Ray.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
I’m here for you. We all are.

FABRIZIO
I do sleepover.

Max hesitates.

MAX
I’1l come by in the morn --
75.

QUENTIN
Are you kidding me right now? Our
friend needs us.

MAX
I already promised Soren. What do
you want me to do?

QUENTIN
I want you to be there for your
friend. You think Soren will be
there when shit goes down?

MAX
Fuck you, Quentin. I skipped
school. I don’t even know where the
fuck I am. I could get in so much
trouble. I’m risking everything for
my friend.

QUENTIN
That’s not because you’re a good
friend. That’s just because you
feel guilty. Admit you’d rather be
with Soren.

MAX
Yeah, maybe I do. He doesn’t freak
out every time I do something
without him and he can talk about
things other than singing. It’s
hard being your friend.

QUENTIN
I expect a lot because I give a
lot.
(then)
Fabrizio is a better friend than
you and we've only known him three
weeks.

FABRIZIO
Grazie.

QUENTIN
(to Max)
You're a...
(searching for word)
Travesty!

FABRIZIO
(stepping between them)
Okay, okay...
76.

MAX
You're the most insecure person
I’ve ever met.

QUENTIN
I thought you were woke, but you’re
the least woke person ever.

MAX
Fuck you, Quentin, you’re not woke!
QUENTIN
My dads are gay! Of course I’m
woke!
MAX

That’s your excuse for everything!

QUENTIN
Eat my ass, honey! You’re the
biggest traitor ever. Go jerk off
to Mrs. Huberty’s yearbook picture.

MAX
That was a secret!

Max pushes him. Quentin pushes him back.

FABRIZIO
Guys, a’stop.

They feint pushing one another.

MAX
It’s your fault we’re even here!

QUENTIN
Have fun when Soren drops you and
then you’ll have no squad!

Max lamely does a side kick.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
No karate!

SMASH!

They look over to see the drone box on the ground. X-Ray
picks it up and slams it to the ground. The boys watch in
shock.

He kicks the box, then picks it up and swings it into a
telephone pole. Fabrizio takes a step forward to stop him,
but Quentin holds him back.
77.

X-Ray drops the destroyed box in a trash can.

X-RAY
I’m going home.

X-Ray doesn’t wait for the others and starts to bike off.
They start to follow. Quentin turns to Max.

QUENTIN
Find your own way back.

CUT TO:
ON X-RAY AND FABRIZIO, WITH QUENTIN ON HIS PEGS --
Biking down a sidewalk.
ON MAX --
Biking down a different sidewalk, alone.
WIDEN TO REVEAL
They're all biking down opposite sides of the same street.

Max sees Quentin and the others turn down a side street and
disappear. He shakes his head.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HAZELTINE AVENUE - DUSK
Streetlights hum to life as the sun sets.
Max's phone RINGS.

He stops and pulls his phone from his backpack. Checks the
caller ID:

QUENTIN.
Max answers.
(cool)
Hey.
INTERCUT WITH:
TIGHT ON Quentin.

QUENTIN
So, we got stopped by some cops...
78.

MAX
Shit! Did you tell them you were
Jewish?

QUENTIN

They didn’t care. But we told them
everything about the girls and the
drugs. They’re being really cool
about it and said they’d let us go
if you bring the real drugs. Do you
still have them?

Max pulls a FLINTSTONES VITAMIN PILL BOX from his pocket.

MAX
Yeah. Text me the address.

Quentin nervously glances over his shoulder to REVEAL --

Jordy menacingly playing with a butterfly knife in an
ABANDONED RAILYARD.

QUENTIN
Okay.

MAX
Hey, and I’m sorry for earlier. I
didn’t mean what I said.

QUENTIN
And I’m sorry I told everyone that
you jerked off to the lunch lady.
Jordy shakes her head. She motions for Quentin to wrap it up.
MAX
Maybe the cops can give us a ride
back to school.
QUENTIN
Good idea. I’1ll ask.
(then, to Jordy)
Can you drive us back for our
recital, Officer St. Cloud?
BACK TO MAX
His eyes go wide -- “Officer St. Cloud?”
BACK TO RAILYARD

X-Ray and Fabrizio look up -- “Officer St. Cloud?”
Jordy glares at Quentin, doesn’t say anything. Quentin

nervously puts the phone back to his ear.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
Officer St. Cloud said yes.

MAX
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.
I’1ll see you soon.

Max hangs up. He thinks, then makes another call.

79.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SOREN’S BEDROOM - SAME

Soren studies three OUTFITS laid out on his bed. His phone

rings.

SOREN
(into phone)
What’s up, Bitch?

MAX
(urgent)
Hey, I need your help.

SOREN
What’s going on? Kinda in the
middle of something.

MAX
Some older girls kidnapped Quentin,
X-Ray and Fabrizio.

SOREN
What do you want me to do?

MAX
I didn’t know who else to call. The
girls are in your brother's grade.
Maybe he could call them or
something.

SOREN
I’m sure Quentin and those guys are
just being weak.

MAX
It’s real! They’re in trouble!

SOREN
I told you, I’m busy!
80.

MAX
«+. Okay, forget it.

Max hangs up, unsure what to do.

EXT. ABANDONED RAILYARD - SAME

Saticoy and Van Nuys. This is a far cry from the bright
lights of Ventura Boulevard. A graffitied billboard for a
long-shuttered strip club hangs above a blown out ticketing
office.

Jordy’'s headlights illuminate Quentin, X-Ray, and Fabrizio,
all huddled together on the ground.

Jordy grabs one of the boys’ bikes from the bed of her truck
and tosses it to the ground.

ANGLE ON
HANNAH, LILY, AND JASLYN
They speak in hushed tones.

HANNAH
We're literally involved in a
kidnapping.

LILY
Don’t be so dramatic. We didn’t
kidnap them. We just took them.

JASLYN
We're kidnapped, too.

LILY
No, we’re not.

JASLYN
Tell Jordy that we need to go.
What’s her problem?

HANNAH
She’s always been crazy. When she
was fourteen, she dated a thirty
year old.

LILY
Isn't that illegal?

JASLYN
Yeah. She should be in jail.
81.

LILY
Hannah, you need to tell her we
need to go.

Hannah shakes her head, scared.
Jordy grabs the other bikes from the back of her truck.

JORDY
You think you can switch out my
drugs for kids vitamins and there
won't be consequences?

She tosses the bike on top of the other and walks back to the
truck. She rummages inside, grabs something from the glove
compartment.

Quentin looks around for an escape.

QUENTIN
(whispers)
Okay, I’m going to cause a
diversion by pretending I have
appendicitis.

Behind them, Jordy walks over to the bikes and DOUSES them
with lighter fluid.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
(oblivious)
When they come over to see what’s
wrong, you guys grab the bikes and
haul ass.
(then)
Ready? On three --

WHOOSH! The boys’ bike IGNITE into a pyre of twisted metal
and rubber. The boys watch in horror as their only way home
goes up in flames.

JASLYN
Hey, Jordy, I need to get going. I
have dinner with my grand --

JORDY
No one goes anywhere.
EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - NIGHT
Max pedals furiously down the sidewalk. He skid stops and

races over to a TRASHCAN. He rummages through it until he
pulls out --
82.

THE DRONE.

He tears open the box and inspects the damaged contents. He
lifts a propeller that’s broken in half.

EXT. ABANDONED RAILYARD - SAME

Jordy sits on her truck bumper. The TRUCK NUTZ dangle between
her legs. She cracks her neck, checks her watch.

The remains of the bikes smolder in the background.

QUENTIN

I need to go to the bathroom.
JORDY

Hold it in.
QUENTIN

I could get a UTI!
JORDY
(shaking her head)
Hannah, take the dwarf.

Quentin bristles as Hannah leads him off.

EXT. ABANDONED RAILYARD - SIDE OF BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
Quentin has his back to Hannah. He looks over his shoulder.

QUENTIN
I can’t pee while you’re here.

HANNAH
Believe me, I’m not trying to look.

He starts to go.

QUENTIN

She didn’t have to say that.
HANNAH

What?
QUENTIN

That I’m a dwarf. I’m not a dwarf.

HANNAH
Okay.
83.

QUENTIN
I don't suffer from dwarfism.
That’s offensive to me and it’s
offensive to dwarfs.
(then)
Why are you friends with her?

HANNAH
When you’re in high school,
sometimes you're not friends with
your friends.

QUENTIN
My best friend is ditching us for
the popular kids because he thinks
we're losers.

HANNAH
Why?

QUENTIN
I don’t know. Because we’re not
into sports, we’re into singing.

HANNAH
Are you good?

QUENTIN
We won the tri-county Voice of an
Angel tournament last year.

HANNAH
That’s cool. I wish I could sing.
QUENTIN
Really?
HANNAH
Yeah, I’m so jealous of people who
can sing.

This buoys Quentin’s spirits. They start to head back,
Quentin walking a little bit taller.

QUENTIN
Hey, you should come to our recital
later.

HANNAH

I hate to break it to you, but I
don’t think we’re getting out of
here any time soon.
84.

EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - SAME

We HEAR a sputtering hum.

ON an OLDER COUPLE --

SOMETHING comes right at them. They duck out of the way.
ON A CAR --

The bored DRIVER’s eyes suddenly go wide and she REAR-ENDS
the car in front of her.

TURN TO REVEAL THE DRONE --

Sputtering down the middle of the street, like a drunken
bumble bee. The drone drops five feet, swerves to the left,
then coughs its way back to its flight path.

It turns down a street, rising higher and higher.

ON MAX --

Manning the drone from his iPhone while simultaneously
biking.

EXT. ABANDONED RAILYARD - SAME

EYE IN THE SKY POV

Taking in the location from above:

-- THE ABANDONED STRUCTURES

-- THE TRAIN TRACKS

-- THE BOYS HUDDLED BY THEIR BURNING BIKES

(Note: it has a striking resemblance to the GRAND THEFT AUTO
level the boys played earlier.)

ON MAX
Surveilling the layout on the drone controller.
ANGLE ON

THE DRONE, sputtering, flying erratically. It suddenly drops
twenty-five feet. Stabilizes, then drops again.

ON THE GIRLS
85.
LILY
Do you hear that noise?

Jordy and the girls look up to see the drone quickly
descending like a comet, flying past them and crashing into --

JORDY’S WINDSHIELD.

JORDY
What the fuck?!

She pulls the drone from the cracked windshield. She sees a
note attached to it. She opens it.

JORDY (CONT'D)
(reading)
“Moist.”

The Girls grumble.
GIRLS

Ugh! / I hate that word. / What
kind of pervert would write that?

QUENTIN
(to X-Ray and Fabrizio)
It’s Max!
FROM THE DARKNESS --
MAX (0.S.)

Leave now and you won’t get hurt!

Jordy flicks open her butterfly knife, waves it toward the
boys.

JORDY
I’m about to start cuttin’ off
fingers.
QUENTIN
(shrieking)
MAX!!
ON MAX
Perched on the roof, the paintball gun pressed into his
shoulder, like a sniper. His finger touches the trigger. He
adjusts the sight -- Jordy is in the CROSS-HAIRS.
And he FIRES --

And hits Fabrizio in the kneecap!
86.

FABRIZIO
Ahhhh!! I bleeding!
(then, checking)
No, it’s paint.

ON MAX

MAX
Dammit!

Max starts SHOOTING, spraying paint everywhere. They all take
cover, hiding behind Jordy’s car.

Jordy grabs Quentin and puts the knife to his fingers.

JORDY
Stop shooting or I cut his pinky!

GIRLS
Jordy! Stop! / What are you doing?!

JORDY
(calling to Max)
What’s it gonna be, tough guy?

In the shadows, Max cautiously steps down a wooden ladder
attached to the building, making certain to put both feet on
each rung. He jumps the last one, dropping eighteen inches to
the ground.

He lifts his arms up in surrender.

MAX
(nervously)
Don’t hurt me.

JORDY
I am gonna hurt you, but first
you're gonna give me the drugs.

REVERSE ANGLE

The paintball gun is messily taped to the back of Max’s T-
shirt.

Max pulls the Flintstone Pill Box from his pocket.

MAX
(re pills)
I won’t let you destroy my
community -- or any community --
with these.
87.

JORDY
I’m going to enjoy this.

She shoves Quentin out of the way and charges Max with the
outstretched knife.

Max reaches behind down his back for his paintball gun, but
he’s taped it TOO LOW.

He reaches up his back, but it’s TOO HIGH.

ON JORDY

Now running full speed, snarling and determined, just like
the pitbull chasing Josh Brolin through the river in “No
Country For Old Men.”

As she leaps, Max pulls his shirt over his head, giving him
access to the gun.

And at the last moment --
HE SHOOTS HER POINT BLANK IN THE FACE.

Jordy goes down, writhing on the ground, her face covered in
BLUE PAINT splatter.

JORDY (CONT'D)
Abhh!! Fuck! Ahhh! Fuck!!

Max DROPS the gun in shock -- that wasn’t a video game.

FABRIZIO
Holy sheet! You shot her in the
fucking face.

MAX
Oh my god.

Quentin runs to Jordy’s truck, hops in, and pulls the keys
from her visor.

QUENTIN
Got her keys!

MAX
Are you serious?

QUENTIN
She burned our bikes. It’s the only
way to make it back in time.
(then, to X-Ray)
But only if you still want to sing.
88.

X-RAY
Fuck, yeah I wanna sing. This might
be the last time we ever sing
together.

SPLAT! A paintball EXPLODES on the windshield beside X-Ray’s
face.

REVEAL

Jordy leveling the paintball gun on the boys. She has a
crazed look in her eye.

JORDY
I‘1l fucking end you!

SPLAT! SPLAT! SPLAT!
The guys jump into the truck, narrowly avoiding the paint.

Quentin turns the ignition and keeps turning it, shredding
the starter.

The truck REVERSES at high speed, kicking up a cloud of dust
before missing the exit and SMASHING THROUGH THE CHAIN LINK
FENCE, FISHTAILING out onto the street.

INT. JORDY’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Heavy breathing.

MAX
Seat belts.

We hear the CLICKS of belts being buckled.
Quentin puts the truck in DRIVE and takes off.
THE YARD

Disgusted, Jordy points the paintball gun at Hannah's face,
who instinctively puts her hands up.

JORDY
Take me to the recital, fam.

CUT TO:
89.

EXT. SHERMAN WAY - NIGHT

A HELL’S ANGEL rumbles down the street. He looks over to his
right to see Jordy’s truck -- he double takes as it looks
like the truck is driving itself.

I/E. JORDY'S TRUCK - SAME

The seat has been moved all the way forward and all the way
up, yet Quentin can still barely see over the steering wheel.
Max, X-Ray, and Fabrizio are crowded beside him. Max looks at
his phone’s GPS.

MAX
Take this ramp!

Quentin jerks across two lanes of traffic to make the 170
freeway entrance. He steadies the truck.

MAX (CONT'D)
You're doing good.

QUENTIN
Thanks.
(then, quiet)
You came back for us.

MAX
(solemn)
I pledged it.

Quentin reaches over and Max takes his hand -- they do the
“pledge” clasp.

Up ahead, the rush hour traffic is slowing down.

X-RAY
Shit. There’s too much traffic.
We’re not going to make it.

MAX
(pointing to the shoulder)
There’s no one in that lane.

QUENTIN
Good eye, Maxwell!

Quentin swerves onto the shoulder and guns it. The Truck
FLIES past the stopped traffic.

X-RAY
Why doesn’t anyone use this lane?!
90.

QUENTIN
Probably because people are sheep.

A SIREN SOUNDS. A STATE TROOPER IS BEHIND THEM, LIGHTS
FLASHING.

QUENTIN (CONT'D)
Fuck. Five-oh.

FABRIZIO
Now we’ll miss the recital.

MAX
We’re gonna get grounded.

QUENTIN
We're not getting grounded and
we're not gonna miss that recital.

Quentin SWERVES ACROSS FIVE LANES OF TRAFFIC TO GET ON TO THE
101 FREEWAY.

The boys cheer. The cheers fade when the see the gridlock up
ahead.

X-RAY
LA has a real traffic problem.

A SIREN screams as flashing lights pull up behind them.

I/E. POLICE CRUISER - SAME
The STATE TROOPER barks into the police radio.

STATE TROOPER
Code 3. 2-Adam-4 in pursuit of a
black Ford F-150 heading southbound
on the 405. Possible drunk driver.

JORDY’S TRUCK

QUENTIN
What’s happening?

Max tilts the REARVIEW MIRROR completely toward the passenger
side.

MAX
Cop's still there. Lose him! We
could get grounded!

QUENTIN
This guy’s so erratic!
91.

Quentin cuts the wheel, hops off the freeway and onto an
EMBANKMENT. The engine WHIRS as the truck OFFROADS up the
hill. The Cop Car attempts to follow them, but BOTTOMS OUT
when it hits the embankment, shooting SPARKS everywhere.

The black and white slides to a stop.

INT. HANNAH'S CAR - SAME

Silence. Hannah drives. Lily and Jaslyn sit in the back.
Jordy stares straight ahead, her finger dancing on the
trigger of Max’s PAINTBALL GUN. In the dark of night, with
the dried blue paint cracked across her skin, she looks
possessed.

EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - LATER

A dozen cars snake into the driveway, passing a school
Marquee that reads:

SIXTH GRADE CHORUS RECITAL
TONIGHT 645 PM

“WINTER CONCERT: MANIFEST DESTINY”

I/E. JORDY'S TRUCK - LATER
The boys pull up a block away from the school.

QUENTIN
We can walk from here.

MAX
Wait. I can’t bring drugs into the
school. It’s a drug-free zone.

X-RAY
If you leave it in the car, some
little kids might think they’re
vitamins and O.D.

Max pulls out a pen and writes a note. He tapes it to the
pill box.

MAX
We'll come back later and give it
to an adult.

Quentin shuts off the truck (leaving it in “Drive”). They
quickly exit and start running toward the school.
92.

BEHIND THEM --

JORDY’S TRUCK BEGINS TO SLOWLY ROLL DOWN THE STREET.

It picks up speed, side-swiping a row of parked cars and
leaving a trail of broken side mirrors in its wake. It hops
the curb, rolls through a grassy median.

Cars honk and swerve.

CUT TO:

I/E. POLICE CAR - SAME

A SPOTLIGHT shines from the Police Cruiser as a COP looks for
any sign of the truck. He talks into the radio.

COP
(into radio)
I’m on Hazeltine. Pretty quiet over
here. Wait, I’m hearing something --
A sound -- metal scraping? -- comes closer... and... closer.
Car alarms begin going off. The Cop shines his spotlight and
then stops on --
THE LION.
COP (CONT'D)
(into radio)
Holy shit!
The Cop looks back just in time --

To see Jordy’s truck barreling down the street BACKWARDS at
his cruiser.

CRASH!

The Truck T-BONES the POLICE CAR. The Lion runs off into the
woods.

EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT

The boys race up the stairs and burst into the school --

INT. JOHN ADAMS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

In the harsh fluorescent light, we see the toll the day has
taken on them: ripped and dirty clothes. Grimy faces. They
look like they’ve been through battle.
93.

The boys race down an empty hallway, turn a corner and reach
civilization: STUDENT VOLUNTEERS serve refreshments to
PARENTS, TEACHERS, and SIBLINGS. The boys freeze as people
look up and stare.

The boys race past them toward the side entrance to the
auditorium when they hear a stern voice.

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
Xavier Raymond.

They all turn to see X-Ray’s Dad. Quentin turns to X-Ray.

QUENTIN
I’m going to tell him it was my
fault.

MAX

We'll tell him it was all of us.

X-RAY
No.

X-Ray nervously walks over to his dad. The others watch.

X-RAY’S DAD
What happened to your clothes?
You're filthy. What’s going on with
you?

X-Ray stares at his feet.

X-RAY
(quiet)
I broke your drone.

X-RAY’S DAD
Speak up. Take responsibility for
your actions.
(then)
This is why you’re going to Camden
next year. You need to learn
character.

X-RAY
I don’t want to go.

X-RAY’S DAD
Well, it’s not your decision. After
the show, we’re going to sit down
and have a talk about respect and
honesty.

X-Ray looks his father directly in the eye.
94.
X-RAY
Is Dana going to be there?
Beat.

X-RAY’S DAD
Xavier-Raymond, it’s not --

X-RAY
Like I said, I don’t want to go.

X-Ray heads back to the others, surprised at his newfound
courage.

CUT TO:

I/E. JORDY’S TRUCK - NIGHT

Two other Black and Whites are on the scene, surveying the
damage of Jordy’s totaled Truck and the police cruiser.

A COP inspects the inside of the truck. Lowers the visor.
Pops open the glove compartment, pulls out the registration.

He’s about to step out when something on the floor catches
his eye.

He reaches over and picks it up.
It’s a FLINTSTONES PILL BOX with a note taped to the side.
“ILLEGAL SEX DRUGS -- DO NOT EAT”

Off his look.

INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
The guys frantically change into costume. Soren walks over.

SOREN
Hey bitches, saw your pics on
Instagram. Did it take you a long
time to do your makeup?

QUENTIN
(stymied)
-.. We didn’t do it ourselves.

The boys deflate.
95.

MAX
For the record, I’m not coming to
your birthday.

SOREN
(scoffs)
You think you’re still invited? You
and your squad is tragic.

QUENTIN
(correcting)
We are tragic.

Soren shakes his head and walks off. Robin, dressed in all
BLACK, runs up to them.

ROBIN
You’re not in costume?! You’re on
in thirty seconds!

QUENTIN
I’m on your mom in thirty seconds!

ROBIN
She's still in San Diego! I just
talked to her on the phone!

He races off. The boys hurriedly change into their costumes.

INT. AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER

The curtain is down. Mrs. Grandy, wearing an Old West-style
dress, walks onto the stage to polite applause. She sits down
at the piano and begins PLAYING the jaunty opening to “GHOST
RIDERS IN THE SKY.”

Robin pulls up the curtain to REVEAL --

THE BOYS CHORUS ENTERING FROM THE SIDES OF THE STAGE, ALL
DRESSED IN ADORABLE COWBOY OUTFITS.

IN THE AUDIENCE
Dozens of iPhones go up, poised to record.
ON THE STAGE

A few boys “ride” in on papier-maché horse heads connected to
broom sticks.

Our boys proudly step to the front row. Their LASSOS are
latched onto their pleather belts.
96.

As they sing, they use hand motions and choreography to act
out the lyrics and give the audience a better sense of the
song’s story.

BOYS CHORUS
(singing)
An old cowboy went riding out one
dark and windy daaaaaay / Upon a
ridge he rested as he went along
his waaaaaaay...

The SONG plays over the following --

EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME
The lights of the school can be seen a block away.

Jordy and the girls approach the accident scene. Police
lights, fire trucks and ambulances are everywhere.

The Girls are alarmed by the carnage.

LILY
Oh my god. They’re dead.

Jordy sees her crumpled up truck. She slams the dashboard and
tucks the paintball gun into her waistband.

JORDY
They’re dead.

INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME

Our boys step to the front, now holding their LASSOS. They
twirl them over their heads, while continuing to sing.

BOYS CHORUS
(singing)
A bolt of fear went through him as
they thundered through the
skyyyyy---

The boys now lower their lassos and deftly jump in and out of
the rope. The audience APPLAUDS.

BOYS CHORUS (CONT’D)
For he saw the riders coming hard
and he heard their mournful

CLYYYYY---

ON THE GIRLS
97.

Entering from the back. With her suede fringe jacket and face
paint, she looks like she’s part of the show.

In the audience, a FATHER nudges his daughter and points at
Jordy.

FATHER
Oh, look, it’s a Native American.

Jordy heads toward the stage, followed closely by the other
girls.

HANNAH
(whispering)
Are you nuts? There are parents
here.
BACK ON THE BOYS

They spot Jordy. Uh oh. They share a look -- there’s nowhere
to run.

BOYS CHORUS
Yippie yi oohhhh...

All the boys but Max drop their ropes and begin to form a
human pyramid, still singing.

ON THE GIRLS
Hannah, Lily, and Jaslyn step in front of Jordy.
JORDY
(growling)
MOVE.

She lifts her shirt and pulls out the PAINTBALL GUN. Lily and
Jaslyn, frightened, run back toward the exit.

BOYS CHORUS
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were
blurred / Their shirts all soaked
with sweat...
ON STAGE

Soren and some other bigger kid form the base, followed by x-
Ray, Fabrizio, and Quentin.

ON JORDY AND HANNAH

Hannah holds her ground. Jordy shoves Hannah out of the way.
98.

BOYS CHORUS (CONT’D)
He's riding hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught em yet...

Max climbs to the top and continues to twirl his rope. The
audience goes nuts.

ON JORDY

Leveling the paintball gun at Max.

As she’s about to shoot, Hannah SHOVES her from behind. Jordy
squeezes the trigger as she trips, which causes her to mis-—
fire and shoot Soren IN THE FACE.

Over the singing, we HEAR:

SOREN
Owww !

He collapses...

Which causes the whole pyramid to collapse. The deaf Mrs.
Grandy, eyes closed, oblivious, keeps playing.

The audience turns, sees Jordy wielding the paintball gun.
JORDY
Stay in your seats. It’s just a
paintball gu --
A rope LASSOS her.
REVEAL MAX

Lassoing Jordy with his lariat. Jordy struggles. She’s about
to break free when --

ANOTHER LARIAT

This one belonging to Quentin.

TWO MORE LARIATS

From Fabrizio and X-Ray.

Hannah jumps on top of Jordy to restrain her.
ON THE BACK DOORS

Lily and Jaslyn rush in, followed by several COPS. Mrs.
Grandy opens her eyes, sees the chaos, and abruptly stops.
99.

The Cops head over to Jordy and handcuff her. They pull her
from the auditorium.

JORDY (CONT'D)
(not so tough)
Call my dad!

ON STAGE
Quentin motions to Max, X-Ray, and Fabrizio.
QUENTIN
(whispers)
Come on, we need to finish. These
people paid for a show.
Our boys step forward. They’re the only ones left on stage.
BOYS
(singing)
Yippie yi yay... Ghost riders in
the skyyyyy-

The audience is quiet. Then we hear a few whoops. It’s
Hannah, Lily, and Jaslyn. They give the boys a knowing nod.

GIRLS
Woo!!

The audience, unsure, joins in. Quentin beams, takes the
hands of the other boys and they all take a deep bow.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - A WEEK LATER

The boys walk through the cafeteria carrying their trays.
Other kids pat them on the back. Girls smile at them.

WIDEN TO REVEAL
A CNN CAMERA CREW and REPORTER trailing them.
QUENTIN

This is where we eat lunch.

X-RAY
Some kids call it the lunch room,
but we call it the cafeteria.

I eat nine apple a’day.

They take a seat at their table. The Reporter sits down with

them.

REPORTER
You guys are pretty popular these
days.

QUENTIN

Thank you. As well, we're big fans.
It’s an honor to be on CNN Heroes.
