UNTITLED
By

Dave Eggers & Vendela Vida

November 2007

CAA/Sally Willcox
A woman, about 30, lies in bed, her head propped up by four

pillows. It’s very dark -- we see only her silhouette.

VERONA
(speaking to someone below
her)
Burt?

There’s some shuffling under the sheets.

VERONA
What’s wrong?

More shuffling in the bed. A voice from under the covers.

BURT
Nothing.

VERONA
That’s what I mean. Why’d you stop?

BURT
I'm trying to figure out the best
way to say what I’m about to say.

VERONA
It’s been a while since I waxed...

BURT
No, no.
(still trying to find the
best way to say it)
Uh. You taste different.

Verona sits up, sighing.

VERONA
Please. Last time you complained
about the taste I banned you from
my region for a year. You want me
to shower?

Burt emerges from under the covers and stares at Verona.
BURT
No, you’re clean. But you know a
woman can taste different depending
on various co-factors.

Verona sits up in a huff.

*
VERONA
I don’t want to hear this. And I
thought we agreed you wouldn’t use
the word “co-factor.”

BURT
I said I wouldn’t MISuse it. All
I’m saying is that from what I’ve
read about vaginal flavor--

VERONA
Jesus!

BURT
From what I’ve read, I know that
abrupt changes happen when a
woman’s either menopausal...
(registering a new,
momentous thought)
or--

Verona slaps him as hard as she can.

INT. DRUGSTORE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

They're at the checkout counter with two pregnancy tests.
It's evident they’ve pulled their clothes on hastily. Burt is
still holding his face where Verona slapped him.

VERONA
Sorry. I don’t know why I did that.
BURT
It’s okay.
VERONA
Have I ever done that before?
BURT
Nope.
VERONA
It just seemed the right thing at
the time.
BURT

It’s okay. After the initial shock,
it was kind of exciting.

BURT FARLANDER is white, about 30, looking like he could be
either an assistant professor or a lunatic shooting people
from a tower -- there’s that funny-crazy look in his eyes.

*
He’s very smart, very straightforward and earnest, but also
eccentric -- the type of guy who’s never done drugs, but has
often gone camping nude. He reads widely but not deeply
enough, and has many strange hobbies, which he indulges for
short periods of time but with utter seriousness. The last
such hobby was bear-tracking. He works in the insurance
industry.

VERONA DE TESSANT is of mixed race - her mom was white, her
father black. She’s very cute, diminutive, a bit feisty.
She’s a medical illustrator and has the necessary combination
of the artistic and the exacting. Of the pair, she is the
more socially presentable and stable, and finds herself
apologizing for her partner at least once a week. Still, she
is devoted to him and he to her. Her beauty and sense of
humor are alluring and inspire many admirers.

INT. CAR -- DRIVING HOME

Verona’s driving.

VERONA
I can’t wait.

BURT
What?

VERONA

I’m pulling over.

BURT
We’re ten minutes away. No.

She pulls over.

BURT
What're you...

Verona is already out of the car and pushing down her jeans.

BURT
At least get off the shoulder!

Sounds of urine hitting gravel.

BURT
It’ll be less accurate out here.

VERONA
What?
BURT
You're supposed to do this ina
bathroom. The air out here is
different. The alkaline...

VERONA
The alkaline? The alkaline? Just...
please. I’m done. Hold this on the
end here.

Verona hands him the stick. He holds it at a distance, the
way you would a steaming pot, while she pulls up her pants.

VERONA
Lay it flat.

BURT
Lay it flat? Like on the road?
Should I lay it on the road?

VERONA
No...on the dashboard or something.

Verona gets back in the driver’s seat. They’re
staring at the stick, which has been placed on

VERONA
It’s time. Turn on the light.

in the car,
the dash.

Burt turns on the light. It’s far too dim to see anything.

VERONA
That’s the light? That’s your
interior light?

BURT
What? Yes that’s my interior light?
What’s wrong with my interior
light? You've never had a problem
with my interior light before...

VERONA
Just-- Shut up. Turn on the
headlights.

She gets out and slams the door.

EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER -- IN FRONT OF THE CAR

They're both bathed in the white light of the headlights.
VERONA
Damn. I can’t tell. I need a
control sample. Here.

She hands him a second stick from the package.
BURT

No. This is insane. Let’s do it in
the bathroom.

Verona gives him a look. Burt turns away from the car. Sounds

of urine hitting gravel.

VERONA
Okay, now bring it over here.
BURT
But you said not on the road.
VERONA
I don’t care what I said. We need
the light.
Verona lays Burt’s stick next to the other one on the road.
Her movements are meticulous, precise. Burt reads the
instructions while they’re waiting.
BURT
So basically one line is nothing,
two lines is baby...
Verona holds up both test sticks to the beam of the
headlight. One stick shows one line, the other two.
Burt grins.
VERONA
Holy mother of God.
-- TITLE, CREDITS --
EXT. COLORADO TOWN -- FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN
We see a quick montage of local landscapes -- mountains,

trees, valleys, snow-capped peaks, ex-urban sprawl. This is

where our couple lives.

The montage blends seamlessly into a new, strange kind of

landscape.
The sun is rising over a hill. It’s beautiful but also stark
and perhaps even eerie, given that the hill is caramel-

colored.

INT. BEDROOM -- FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN -- MONTHS LATER

We back up a few inches and realize that the camera has lined
up so Verona’s belly -- 5 months pregnant -- looks like a
small round mountain, and the sun appears to be rising behind
it. We hear vague sounds of scraping.

Verona wakes up, turns over, sees Burt sitting up, with a

knife and

Verona is

a piece of wood.

BURT

Hey. I’m glad you’re up.
VERONA

What are you doing?
BURT

What does it look like? I’m

cobbling.
in disbelief.

BURT
I want to be a dad who knows how to
carve stuff out of wood. I want our
kid to get up in the morning and
find me cobbling.

VERONA
You're not cobbling.

BURT
I am cobbling. Look. I’ve got a
knife and some wood and I’m making
a toy...
(looking at the shapeless
blob of wood)
«+. stick. I’m cobbling.

VERONA
You’re not. That’s not what it’s
called.

BURT

Of course it is. How would you
know? You don’t have one of these.
(indicating the knife)
VERONA
Burt, cobbling is shoes. That’s why
they're called cobblers. You're not
cobbling. You’re carving.

Burt thinks for a while. It dawns on him that she’s right.
This takes some of the appeal out of it for Burt. He stops
carving. He rests his pathetic wooden worm/stick on Verona’s
stomach.

BURT
Look, she likes it. I saw her kick.

VERONA
No you didn’t.

BURT
I can do other things, too. I just
bought a book about knots. 300
knots, and I’m gonna learn them
all. And I’m gonna build a kiln.
We've got to be ready!

Verona goes into the bathroom. We follow her.

VERONA
Remember we go to your parents’
house at noon. Be ready for that.

Burt pops his head into the bathroom. He’s now wearing
goggles and fatigues.

BURT
I pushed it back to 12:30. I’ve got
that family-defense class today.

VERONA
No, no, no. You’ve been so normal
for the past few weeks...

BURT
I‘1l be back at noon. Might be
later if we get into some hand-to-
hand action. See you guys.

He leans down to kiss Verona’s lips passionately and her
stomach gently, and then walks out.

We follow Burt out of the house, where we see that it’s a
small ranch house, one step up from a trailer, attached to a
small grungy yard. He gets into a crumbling old Toyota and
drives off.
INT. KARATE-TYPE STUDIO

Burt is in a class with a dozen other men, lined up in neat
rows. The instructor is a Navy SEAL-type, also wearing
goggles. Behind him are inflatable models of a wife and two
small children. The wife is wearing a halter top and the
children both have (real) iPods attached to them.

INSTRUCTOR
Will you be there to defend your
family?
BURT
(in unison with the
others)
I will!
INSTRUCTOR

Do you have the skills to prevent
them from being taken from you,
leaving you bereft and emasculated?

BURT
(in unison with the
others)
I do!

With that, the instructor steps over to Burt and gives hima
kick round-house kick to the side of the head. Burt goes
down. We see the instructor from Burt’s perspective, hovering
over him, the inflatable family in the background.

INSTRUCTOR
Not yet you don’t.

INT. HOUSE -- VERONA’S OFFICE/STUDIO -- MIDMORNING

The sounds of huffing and puffing. We think for a second that
Verona’s exercising or in labor. But we turn the corner and
see Verona sitting at her drafting table, brush in hand,
working on a medical illustration.

It’s a cramped and messy place -- illustration board, a
drawing table, canvases, hundreds of markers and small paint
containers. All over the walls are insane photos of people
and animals in mid-surgery.

Verona’s on the phone, looking at a TV in the corner, where a
prenatal exercise video is playing. On screen, there are
three women doing supra-geeky aerobic routines.
10.

They look like they’re direct from 1986, with headbands and
leg-warmers and poofy hair. The decor is ridiculous -- as if
they're exercising in a “Price Is Right” living room
interior. The saddest thing is that this is a brand-new pre-
natal fitness DVD.

VERONA
I wish you could see this, Grace.

We see Grace, Verona’s sister, on the other end of the phone.
GRACE is striking-looking: caramel-skinned, thin, curvy.

She's immaculately dressed, projecting an air of
sophistication and professionalism. She paces around her

office at work -- a glass building in Phoenix, dramatic
desert view -- with a hands-free device attached to her ear.
VERONA
You want to hear the rhyming
couplets?

Instead of reaching for a bagel
Do another Kegel

GRACE
No!

VERONA
You like that? Jesus. Grace, tell
me: Do I have to be uncool for the
rest of my life?

GRACE
What are you doing? You’re talking
to me while you're exercising?

VERONA
No, I’m just watching it. I’ve got
a cranial surgery thing due Friday.
Trying to finish it before dinner
at Burt’s parents tonight.

We see that Verona is working on an illustration of a cranial
operation. The subject’s skin is peeled back, revealing the
brain, and there’s a scalpel entering the subject’s front
lobe via the nostril. It’s incredibly graphic, and Verona is
doing the work with incredible nonchalance -- she’s snacking
on cold lasagna set unsettling close to the open-brain
illustration.

GRACE
They must be out of their minds
excited.

+ HH HH
11.

VERONA

You have no idea.

(touching up part of the

painting where a scalpel

is inserted into the

skull via the nostril)
I think part of them is happy to be
the only set of grandparents. To
have the baby to themselves.

GRACE
Don’t say that.

Grace looks at a photo of her and Verona’s parents, on her
desk. In it, their parents are chasing the two girls -- 6 and
8 years old at the time -- in front of a big, funny old house
in the country. In the picture, it’s winter, a bit bleak.

GRACE
You’re so lucky to have them so
close. Burt’s lucky to have them
both still--

Now we see that Verona’s looking at the same picture of her
parents in her studio.

VERONA

I know, I know. That’s why we moved

here. I think it’s just a matter of

setting some boundaries.

Lost in her thoughts, she lets her brush drift a bit.

VERONA

Oh shit. I just gave this guy’s

brain a vulva.

INT. CAR -- DRIVING TO BURT’S PARENTS’ HOUSE

Verona is driving. Burt is holding ice to his head.

BURT
So lame.

VERONA
What?

BURT
Forget it.

(changing his mind)
Wait. Tell me something.
(MORE )
12.

BURT (cont'd)
Do I look like I can’t jump from a
two-story building?

VERONA
Wha-
BURT
Just tell me that. Just... let’s

Say you see me on the street, and
you have to make a judgment: can
that guy jump from a second-story
building or not?

VERONA
Burt—
BURT
Please. I need this.
VERONA
(seriously)

Yes. I think you could do it.

BURT
See! But those fuckers were...
Whatever. It doesn’t matter.

They pass over a river. The landscape is wintery and spare.

BURT
I really want her to have an epic
kind of childhood. I want her to
run along the streams and to know
how to work a canoe, and to be able
to entertain herself when she’s
outside. I want her childhood to be
Huck Finny, you know?

VERONA
I had that.

BURT
I know, that’s what I mean. I want
her to have what you had.

VERONA
Without it being in Arkansas.

BURT
Exactly.

Burt’s cellphone rings.
13.

BURT

Burt Farlander.
(listens)

Oh you old so-and-so! Sorry about
your Celtics, my friend. If you
think Paul Pierce can carry more
than a bucket of water, I have a
bridge you might be interested in!

Burt laughs uproariously. This entire time, he’s been
speaking in the voice of a 50s radio announcer. Actually, it
sounds eerily like Casey Kasem, and it’s obvious that this
voice-change Burt uses for clients drives Verona around the
bend.

BURT
Well thanks for calling back. I
wanted to talk to you about
hurricane season. I just.. No, I
know you’re covered, but are you
covered-covered?

When it’s clear the call will go on for a few minutes, Verona
pulls the car over on the highway and gets out, shutting
Burt/Casey Kasem inside.

Finally he motions to her that he’s almost done. She gets
back inside.

BURT
(finishing up)
Okay then. I will! I will! Ha ha.
Yes. Yes. Oh please. You’re too
much. Okay now. Talk to you soon.

They drive for a few minutes in silence. Verona is
contemplating divorce or murder.

BURT
They expect that from me.

VERONA
They expect you to sound like Casey
Kasem.

BURT
Listen, Rona, these guys are all in
their fifties and sixties. We’re
dealing with hundreds of millions
of dollars in insurance futures.
They don’t want to be dealing with
some 31-year-old who didn’t finish
college.
14.

Beat.

VERONA
So Casey Kasem finished college?

Beat.

BURT
Yes.

Silence for a few moments.

VERONA
Do you think your mom’s gonna grope
me this time?

BURT
She always gropes you. She loves
you. She wants to be you.

VERONA
Ten bucks your dad says I look
glorious.

BURT

Listen. He spent 18 months in
prison, Rone--

VERONA
White collar prison. They live
better than we do.

BURT
And now everything is glorious for
him. The English muffins are
glorious. The margarine is
glorious. I gave him my old
sandals, and those were
“spectacular.” But the baby is
really important to them. Now that
they’re retired and I really think
they’re gonna build their world
around little Zeus.

VERONA
It’s a girl. Her name isn’t Zeus.

BURT
(with purpose)
Jesus, Rona. Think about it: Zeus.
Excelsior. Farlander. Zeus
Farlander. That’s the name of a
girl of ... of...
15.

VERONA
Destiny?

BURT
Thank you. A girl of destiny.

INT. PARENTS’ HOME

It’s a very clean upper-middle-class home, a bit on the
overwrought side -- lots of figurines and glass and mirrors.
The door bursts open as Burt and Verona walk up the steps. We
see GLENDA, who is about 60, very fit, wearing a jean jacket
with a faux-fur collar, turned up. She has very short white
hair, cut in that severe style favored by many women her age.
Inexplicably, she’s also wearing a headband.

GLENDA
(to Verona)
Oh! Look at you! You look so big.
Good for you!

BURT
Your hair. What'd you do?
GLENDA
I cut it!
BURT
And the headband.
GLENDA
I know! I know! Come in, your dad’s

inside.

In the front hall, Burt stops upon a large fountain. It seems
to be a sculpture of a colonial pilgrim pumping water from a
tap into some kind of earthenware, held by a Native American
woman. Both are smiling gravely.

In the living room, Glenda is already sitting on the couch,
patting the cushion next to her.

GLENDA
Sit, Verona. Sit next to me and let
me hear the heartbeat.

VERONA
You can’t hear her heartbeat. The
placenta’s on this side--

Verona sits, trying to indicate that the placenta is on the
outside, and thus muffles the sound of the heartbeat...
16.

Too late. Glenda has already arranged her head on Verona’s
stomach. She has one hand on Verona’s thigh and the other
between her breasts and stomach. It’s very intimate. Verona
would be horrified if she were surprised, but she isn’t.

JIM, Burt’s father, enters the room. He is 65, handsome,
successful, with hair longer than Glenda’s, and is limping. A
self-made man, he grew up poor but cultivates an air of
incredible suaveness.

VERONA
Hey Jim! You're looking so much
better! You can barely see where
you broke it.

JIM
Thank you my dear. Verona, you look
glorious.

Verona smiles at Burt.

GLENDA
Did you bring the pictures from the
sonogram?

VERONA
We did.

Verona tries to get up but Glenda is burrowed into her so
deeply that she can't move.

BURT
I'll get them.

Burt removes an envelope from Verona's purse. He starts to
hand it to Glenda, but she’s so busy groping Verona that he
changes course and instead hands the envelope to Jim.

JIM
These are fabulous.
BURT
You haven't opened the envelope
yet.
JIM
I can just tell. He’s a beauty.
VERONA
It's a girl.
(to Burt)

Did --
17.

BURT
I told you that, Dad.

JIM
She's a beauty.

Jim finally opens the envelope.

JIM
Wow. Spectacular. Exquisite.

Glenda is now laying in Verona's lap.

GLENDA
Jim, do you want your glasses?

JIM
I’m fine, Love.

Jim, struggling without his glasses, is looking at the
pictures judiciously, like a doctor examining an X-ray. We
cut to a shot of the sonogram, which is horrifying. A
straight-on picture of the baby’s face, it looks almost
precisely like the skull of an alien with vast ocular
cavities and a row of fangs.

JIM
Talk about perfection!
GLENDA
So, how dark do you think she'll
be?
VERONA
Excuse me?
BURT
Mom.
GLENDA

No, really. Jim and I were kind of
disappointed when Burt’s brother
Courtney married that white woman.

Glenda indicates a wedding picture on the nearby end table,
of Courtney -- shaggy and appealing -- next to a fake-smiling
woman with what seem to be breast implants bursting from her
low-cut wedding dress.

BURT
Helena.

Glenda rolls her eyes at the name.

+ eH
18.

GLENDA
Jim and I think it would be
wonderful to have an African
granddaughter.

JIM
Glenda, the correct terminology is
African-American. It will be
wonderful to have a granddaughter
of African-American persuasion.

GLENDA
Forget the semantics. We're all
family. Verona, how black do you
think she'll be?

VERONA
(looking to Burt for help)
Uh, I don't really know...

GLENDA
Because you know she won't be very
dark at first. It takes a while for
the pigment to settle in.

VERONA
Well, maybe we could leave her out
in the sun for the first couple of
days...

Glenda and Jim look at each other like this might be a valid
option. A judicious look overtakes Jim.

JIM
Verona, are you on schedule?

Jim pronounces the word “shheduuel.”

GLENDA
Don’t ask her that. Verona, we’re
just concerned about your tilted
uterus...

Verona shoots dagger-eyes at Burt. He looks very surprised
that his mom remembered this detail.

GLENDA
Do you think that might present
problems during delivery?

BURT
Okay, that's enough.
(changing the subject)
(MORE )
19.

BURT (cont'd)
So we've been reading all these
books, trying to decide what kind
of birthing experience we want to
have...

JIM
That's terrific.

BURT
-..and we think we want to limit
the amount of people in the room.
Or near the room.

GLENDA
Oh you don’t have to worry about
that.

JIM

Right. No sweat.

BURT
And we decided that we don’t want
any videotaping.

JIM
Right. I won’t. Fabulous.

BURT
But we really want you to share
this with us. Your presence is
really important.

GLENDA
You are so right. We're so looking
forward to it. We will definitely
be there.

JIM
And the only reason we won't be
there is if we’re living in
Belgium.

Burt and Verona are dumbstruck. They have no idea what Jim’s
talking about.

GLENDA
(sitting forward now and
grinning maniacally)
We have news.

JIM
It’s big.
20.

BURT
What is it?

GLENDA
We're leaving in June.

JIM
We're finally doing it.

BURT
You're leaving in June? The baby’s
due in July.

JIM

Right. To Antwerp. City of Light.
BURT

That’s not--. No you’re not.
JIM

We are. It going to be superb.

BURT
Don’t say that word.

GLENDA
We thought you'd be proud of us.
We've been talking about this for
fifteen years and now we can
finally do it.

BURT
You're leaving a month before the
baby’s born? You’re moving 3000
miles away from your grandchild?

GLENDA
It’s more than 3000 miles, isn’t
it, Jim?

JIM
I think so.

BURT
I can’t believe this.

GLENDA
There are planes, Burt.

JIM
This is what we’ve been planning to
do forever, son. You know that.
(MORE )
21.

JIM (cont'd)
We'll make a fortune if we can
declare residency over there.

BURT
How long will you be gone?

GLENDA
Just two years.

BURT
Are you selling the house?

JIM
Well, that’s the best part. We were
going to rent out the house, with
the help of a very handsome
gentleman named Fareed. But no
one’s come forward yet--

BURT
How long have you planned this? Has
our house--

At that moment, Burt sees, on the coffee table, a large ad in
the paper offering the house he grew up in, for rent.

JIM
It’s just been running since
Christmas.

GLENDA
We heard from your old gym teacher!
He came here with another man. They
were both wearing...
(gesturing up and down her
leg to indicate stripes)
++. running suits.

This news is doubly disturbing to Burt.

GLENDA
But if we don’t get a renter in the
next month, you guys can stay here
while we're gone. You can have the
house for the next two years!

Jim is gesturing around him, as if showing the house to his
son for the first time.

JIM
Outstanding.
22.

Verona looks impressed with this idea. Burt, too, softens.
They share a brief day-dream of their daughter running
through the house, playing on the immaculate lawn, swimming
in the pool. The idea grows on them by the minute.

The phone rings, shaking them from their reverie.

Glenda goes to the kitchen to answer it. We hear Glenda’s
excited voice off-screen. Meanwhile, Burt and Verona notice
an unfamiliar sculpture in the living room.

BURT
That new?

It’s a bronze sculpture of a young Native American woman,
wearing little more than a cowhide bikini, raising her arms
to the sky, nipples insanely erect.

JIM
Magnificent, isn’t it? I was
wondering when you’d notice. Twelve
thousand dollars.

VERONA
I can’t believe it.
JIM
I know! She’s a Choctaw princess,

I’m told.

(nodding seriously)
It’s important that we honor our
Indian... Our indigent ... our
indigentous people.

Glenda returns, barely able to contain her excitement.

JIM
Was it Fareed?

Glenda nods.

JIM
Did he....?

Glenda nods quickly, barely containing her euphoria.

JIM
(turning to Burt and
Verona)
Well, it looks like we have some
more news for you two.

CUT TO:
23.

IN CAR -- AFTERNOON
They're driving home from Glenda and Jim’s house.

VERONA
They’re very strange people. I
always forget how strange they are.

Burt is fuming.

BURT
We can get different grandparents.
The second they said “Belgium” I
started thinking of ways to hurt
them. We’1ll make someone else the
grandparents. Our neighbors.
What're their names?

VERONA
I don’t know.

BURT
They look old enough. We can give
them nicknames and tell the baby
that those are the grandparents.
The baby won't know the difference.

VERONA
It really is an awful thing to do.
They knew we moved here for them. I
mean, we’ve only been here for a
year and now... They’1ll miss the
baby’s first two years. It sort of
takes selfishness to a new level.

This crosses a line with Burt.
BURT
It’s not like your parents are
doing anything.

VERONA
My parents are dead, Burt.

BURT
Still...

They drive in silence for a minute.
24.

INT. BURT AND VERONA’S HOUSE --NIGHT

Verona enters, Burt close behind. She stops after entering,
as if seeing their sad little home with new eyes. It’s
clearly freezing inside.

VERONA
I can see my breath.

BURT
I'll get the thing.

Burt pulls a space heater out from under Verona’s desk. The
second he plugs it in, the lights go out; he’s blown a fuse.

The house is in total darkness.

BURT
I’1ll get the candles.

The opening of drawers. A match is struck. This outtage is
routine. Now we see them in candlelight. The conversation
continues as they get candles lit all over their small house.

VERONA
There’s nothing keeping us here.
BURT
(busy with the candles)
Huh.
VERONA
Did you hear me? We could leave,
too.
BURT
(still not paying
attention)
Right.
VERONA

Burt. I’m serious.

BURT
Fine. Where do you want to go?

VERONA
Anywhere. We don’t have to live
here. We can live wherever we want.
I can do my job anywhere, and all
you need is a phone, right?

25.

VERONA (cont'd)
The only reason we’re here is
because your parents are here -- or
were here.

BURT
We don’t want to go back to
Chicago, do we? We did Chicago. And
don’t say Belgium.

Verona hadn’t thought this far.

VERONA
I don’t know.

Now Burt is excited by the idea.

Beat.

BURT
We could go to Idaho. Fishing and
everything. Lots of land. Idaho!

VERONA
Lots of Aryans.

BURT
Not lots. Some. And they’re all in
that one town. It’s better that way
-- we know where they are. Like ...
druids and... Stonehenge.

VERONA
What about Phoenix? We could live
near my sister. Think of that! Oh,
that would make me so happy. And
Lily and Sam live there.

BURT
(almost remembering)
Who are they?

VERONA
You met at their going-away party.
At the arcade.

BURT
Good party.

VERONA
They can be our friends in Phoenix.

BURT
But they weren’t our friends here.

VERONA
But they can be in Phoenix. They
can be our new good friends when we
live in Phoenix.

They sit for a moment, now surrounded by candles. The scene
is oddly beautiful and romantic.

BURT
We won’t need a space heater in
Phoenix...

VERONA

Yeah, but the snakes... And all
that turquoise...

BURT
(holding her from behind,
his arms draped over her
and rubbing her stomach)
Wherever we go, Rona, I will
protect you. From the cold.
(kisses her neck)
From the dark.
(kisses it again)
From the snakes.
(once again)
From the turquoise.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

Verona and Burt are waiting for the doctor to come in. Burt
is playing with the stirrups.

VERONA
I don't want you on that side when
the doctor's examining me.

BURT
Why not?

VERONA
Because you’re not a doctor.

BURT
(examining some
instruments in the
cabinet)
Rona, the only thing they’ve got
that I don’t is the nine years of
schooling.

27.

DR. HILL knocks on door and enters. She is young, blond, with
a kind face and bad jewelry. Burt is displaying his hands,
wearing Dr. Hill’s rubber gloves. She stares at the hands,
deeply confused.

DR. HILL
How are you doing, Verona?

Dr. Hill speaks in a slow whisper, as if she’s mixing her
meds.

VERONA
I'm good.

DR. HILL
Nothing surprising?

VERONA
No, everything’s pretty
predictable. I'll get a mole and
then look in the pregnancy book
under “moles” and it’1ll say “At
this point you may be getting
moles...”

A snap draws Dr. Hill’s attention to Burt. He’s just finished
putting on rubber gloves, as if he and Dr. Hill will be
performing the exam together.

VERONA
This is Burt.

BURT
I’m the husband.

VERONA
He’s not my husband.

BURT
I’m the father.

Dr. Hill looks to Verona to confirm this, which she does with
an almost reluctant closing of her eyes.

DR. HILL
(putting on gloves)
Okay. I'd like to listen to baby's
heartbeat and see if it's as...
(she hesitates, searching
for the right word)
relaxed as it was last time.
28.

Dr. Hill smooths gel on Verona's stomach and uses a Doppler
to listen to the baby. We hear the sounds of the heartbeat.
Verona smiles. Burt smiles. Dr. Hill frowns.

DR. HILL
It's still on the slow side. I
don't think it's anything to worry
about. Baby’s just...

VERONA
It’s a girl.

DR. HILL
She's just a little mellow.

BURT
(his face lighting up)
Could it mean she's an athlete?
Athletes have slow heartbeats.

DR. HILL
(dismissively)
No. It’s probably a bit soon to
know if she’ll be playing sports.
(turning to Verona)
Um... I'm going to do a quick exam
down there.

Burt switches positions so he’s standing near Verona’s head.

BURT
(to Dr. Hill)
She hasn't been able to shave. She
can’t see down there and she won’t
let me do it. But it’s a thicket,
right? You almost expect thorns,
blackberries--

DR. HILL
(proceeding with the exam,
ignoring Burt)
Well, your uterus has expanded, so
it's no longer tilted.

Verona gives Burt a triumphant look.
DR. HILL
Everything else there is looking
good. Nice job.

VERONA
Thanks.
29.

BURT
(now taking off the rubber
gloves)
Thanks.

Dr. Hill deposits her gloves in the garbage, and Burt does,
too, as if together they’ve just finished surgery.

DR. HILL
(suddenly wistful)
You're really, really lucky.

Verona and Burt recognize that Dr. Hill has things on her
mind. There’s a long awkward pause.

VERONA
What about traveling? Is there any
reason I can’t get on a plane?

DR. HILL
Where are you going? Don’t say
Dallas.

VERONA
No. Phoenix. And a few other
places.

BURT
We're looking for a new place to
live.

DR. HILL

Wow. That sounds nice. To get away.
To keep going. Like a quest...

Dr. Hill says the word like a Tolkein wizard would, while
staring at the walls. Instead of medical charts or cheerful
pictures, there’s a large self-portrait Dr. Hill has done.
It’s insanely depressing, seemingly painted with mud and hay.

DR. HILL
Are you videotaping?

VERONA
Huh?

DR. HILL
(pointing to Verona’s
stomach)
The stages? Your growth?

VERONA
Not yet.

a

 %
BURT
I am. I will.

Burt has just found a new hobby.

DR. HILL
You seem really happy, Verona.
VERONA
I am. I do feel happy. Sort of
exuberant.
DR. HILL

(saying the word like it’s

completely foreign)
Exuberant.

(thinking on it)
Well, be prepared. After birth, a
lot of people -- a lot of my
patients at least -- experience a
severe depression after giving
birth. There’s the usual baby
blues, but then there’s the real
deal. It’ll drag you through the
clouds till you can’t see the sun.

Burt and Verona begin feeling depressed, then and there.

DR. HILL
Just let me know and I can write
you a prescription. Most of my
patients are on Zoloft and they ...
love ... it.
(she takes a pad and rips
off the top page; it’s

pre-written -- she gives
the same drugs to
everyone)
Actually, here’s a script just in

case.

She pauses a moment, staring into the eyes of her self-

portrait.

DR. HILL
Just keep the end result in mind.
When you have your baby, it’1l be
just great.

30.

There is no way Dr. Hill, or anyone, could have said this in

a less convincing way.
31.

INT. DENVER AIRPORT -- DAY

Burt and Verona are sitting at the gate. They look not unlike
Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross at the end of The Graduate:
they’ve made a big decision and now are very unsure about it.

BURT
Now I’m wondering what we're doing.

VERONA
We're going to Phoenix. On an
airplane. This is where they keep
the airplanes.

BURT
But in general. Are we nuts?

VERONA
We’ll look around. See if we could
live there. We agree we need to be
near some kind of family, some
friends -- something, some
connection, someone we know. So
we'll see Phoenix, see my sister--

BURT
.+. and our new closest friends...

Burt can’t remember their names. He still has no idea who
these people are.

VERONA
Lily and Sam. And then we go to
Hartford for your job interview.

BURT
My what?
VERONA
(exasperated)

Oh god. Your interview. You're
meeting with Providential Life to
see if they’1l give you a better
commission. You set it up.

Verona removes a small plastic bag full of pre-cut carrots
from her bag. She eats them as they continue talking.

BURT
So then from Hartford we go home?
32.

VERONA
No. Did you look at the itinerary?
I stapled it to your jacket.
(Burt locates it -- it’s
actually stapled to the
inside of his jacket)
We go from Hartford to Montreal.
Montreal’s where I think we should
live if we don’t live in Phoenix.

BURT
Okay. Montreal.

VERONA
This is exciting, if you think
about it. We’re completely

untethered, Burt -- this is a dream
scenario!

BURT
Yeah!

They sit for a long, awkward moment. It’s not particularly
dreamy. Verona keeps eating her carrots.

In front of them, the DEPARTURES lists dozens of
destinations, from Houston to London to Mexico City.

VERONA
Then again, it seems weird, to just
decide on a place and move there.

BURT
C'mon! How did the pioneers do it,
Rona? They just spun that globe,
picked a spot because there was
gold there, or ... wheat ... and
then the whole family got moving,
in their covered wagons and with
their horses and oxen. They
traveled through rain and sleet,
over mountains and plains, and then
three-fourths of them died on the
way. We’re just following in their
footsteps, honey.

Burt lunges for a kiss, and they do, open-mouthed, until Burt
pulls away.

Burt spits out a mouthful of carrots. Now Verona begins
hacking the carrot shrapnel from her throat. Carrots all over
the airport carpet.
33.

A dozen people are watching them. Verona and Burt are used to
this. Their mouths carrot-free, they go back to making out.

INT. RENTAL CAR -- PHOENIX

They're parked at a 7-11. Verona is in the driver’s seat of
the rental car while Burt is inside the store.

Verona is on the phone with Lily.

VERONA
Sure... That sounds fun. We’ll get
there. No problem.

Burt is still in the store, trying on a visor that says
PHOENIX IS PHANTASTIC. Now he’s holding two bottles of wine
up to the glass for Verona’s approval. She points to the one
on the left.

VERONA
It’‘ll be good to see you, too.
What? Of course I can walk. I’m
only six months! What? No. No. Not
much. Okay. See you there.

Burt emerges from the store with the wine. To comment on the
incredible heat of Phoenix, he is walking in slow-motion, as
if swimming through molasses. By the time he’s near the car,
he’s on his knees.

VERONA
(to Burt, who is now
laying beside the car)
Lordy. I forgot about Lily’s mouth.
She’s a good person -- I mean, the
best when you’re really in trouble -
- but the shit that comes out of

her mouth...
BURT
(still laying on the
pavement)
Like what?
VERONA

She just asked if my discharge
smelled like broccoli.

BURT
(curious)
Huh.
(MORE )
34.

BURT (cont'd)

(beat)
Does it?
VERONA
Just... (dropping the subject)
You think we can bring wine to a
dog track?
BURT
(still laying on the
pavement)

Chardonnay? Sure.
(realizing what she’s
actually asking)

Wait. Are we going to a dog track?

VERONA
Yes.

BURT
Hold on.

He goes back into the 7-11.

EXT. GREYHOUND TRACK -- AFTERNOON

Verona and Burt -- who is now wearing the PHOENIX IS
PHANTASTIC visor -- get out of the car and wander through the
complex. At the fence near the track, they find LILY and SAM,
with their two children. LILY is 40, average-looking, a bit
matronly, wearing red cowboy boots which someone has told her
look sexy. SAM is rigid, with a mustache and short, gelled
hair. He wears a button-down shirt and shorts that are a size
too small. Their children are ASHLEY, 10 years old and a
tomboy, and TAYLOR, 6 years old and on the pudgy side. He’s
wearing a shirt that also says PHOENIX IS PHANTASTIC.

Lily is turning to tuck in Taylor’s shirt when she sees Burt
and Verona.

LILY

(rushing toward Verona)
Oh god, look at you! You’re only
six months in! Jesus, you're huge.
And your face! It’s like you’re
half Chinese. Wow. Come here and
give us a hug! Sam, come give a hug
to the most beautiful woman in the
world!

Sam walks over. Lily sees something in Sam’s face that
indicates he has no idea who these people are.
35.

LILY

Verona and I were desk buddies in
Chicago! At the agency! That was
before she broke out on her own...

(to Verona)
I still have no idea where you
learned how to paint the insides of
dead people. So fucking disgusting,
girlfriend!

(now to Burt)
She’s so talented! Our little
artiste!

Sam is still fuzzy.

LILY
You met them at our going away
party. At the arcade.

Now Sam remembers. Almost.

SAM
Good party.

Sam gives Verona an awkward hug and shakes Burt’s hand. He's
holding a half-full plastic cup of white wine. He sees the
bottle of wine in Burt’s hand.

SAM
Oh good.
(taking the bottle)
I was almost out. Can I get you
guys something?

VERONA
Water.

BURT
Beer would be good.

Sam gulps the contents of his plastic cup, chucks it into the
garbage and walks toward the concession stand.

Taylor is sitting on the ground, holding a Crayola marker and
a racing form, circling the dogs he thinks will win. Ashley
is standing against the fence, watching the action on the
track, wishing she were living a different life.

VERONA
So you're in Arizona! You're
Arizonans! I can’t believe how big
the kids are. Taylor’s so handsome!
36.

LILY
(laughs skeptically)
Well, thanks. We’re gonna do
something about the ears. You see
them? He looks like a trophy. You
know what I mean, one of those
trophies with the arms on it?

Lily is finding herself hugely amusing. She has been told a
few times that she should do stand-up comedy, and in her mind
she’s constantly testing out her material.

Lily now turns her attention to Ashley.

LILY

This one has that dyke look.

(wrinkling her nose)
Doesn't she? Isn’t that weird?
She’s only ten but I’m sure she’s a
dyke. She’s gonna be a point guard
for the WNBA. Aren’t they all
lesbians? I think that’s weird, how
the lesbians sort of rule that
whole sport. Walk for Verona,
Ashley. Show us your tough-girl
walk. Go butch on us.

Ashley doesn’t move or turn around.

LILY
Oh now she’s shy. And look at her
ass -- she’s got... what is it,

Sam? Junk in the trunk? She’s got

junk in her trunk. I don’t know if
the dykes go for that or not. Burt,
you worked with a dyke, didn’t you?

BURT
(whispering -- not wanting
the kids to hear more of
the conversation)
Yes, I--

LILY
(louder, defiant)
I can’t hear you.

BURT
(now in a louder whisper)
I just ... don’t know if we should

be talking like this in front of
the kids.
37.

LILY
Oh god. It’s just white noise to
them.

We see the kids for a second, and it’s clear that they’re
hearing every word.

Sam has returned with the drinks, and a corkscrew for the
wine.

SAM
(holding the corkscrew,
indicating the concession-
stand workers)
Those bastards didn’t want to give
me this. Fuck those motherfuckers.
Redneck pieces of redneck shit.

Burt is taken aback. Sam switches back to perfect
congeniality.

SAM
What’s your line again, Burt? Lily
was telling me but it was all
gibberish coming from her.

Burt takes a swig of his beer and seems very thankful for it.
He and Sam take a few steps toward the track -- having their
own conversation while Verona and Lily have theirs.

BURT
It’s not that complicated, really.
I trade insurance futures. Just
like you get insurance, insurance
companies need it themselves...

SAM
Dammit, right! Shit. Of course it
would come to this.

Sam is speaking in an urgent whisper, as if he’s finally
figured it all out.

BURT
What?

SAM
They made us afraid of everything.
Insurance for insurance for
insurance. Bunkers and bubbles and
.»+. aw hell. This country is shit.
Shit shit shit.

(MORE )
38.

SAM (cont'd)
But everyone else in the world is
just the flies on our shit, am I
right?

Burt has nothing to say. On the track, there is a brief
ceremony saluting the soldiers killed in Iraq.

SAM
Watch the big one, number 8. I’ve
got eight bills on him to place.

Sam pats Burt on the back and throws a steely-eyed glare
across the greyhound track.

LILY

(throwing her voice over

from the conversation

she’s having with Verona)
Hey Sam, I used to have boobs,
right? Verona doesn’t remember, I
don't think. I had nice tits,
right?

(indicating her kids)
They sucked me dry.

SAM
This is correct. I married a busty
woman, and now--

LILY
Now they look like rolls of
quarters stuck into two thin socks.
Are you ready for that, Burt? I can
tell you’re probably a boob-man.

Burt forces a weak chuckle. The dog race ends.
SAM
Ah shit.
(to Burt)
Looks like dinner’s on you.

Sam downs his wine.

SAM
Let’s do it.

CUT TO:
39.

INT. RESTAURANT ABOVE THE RACETRACK

LILY
So Burt, you excited about all
this?

Burt thinks she means the dog track.

BURT
Yeah, this is the best one I’ve
seen, I think.

He looks around approvingly.

LILY
No, the baby, dummy. Does this mean
you guys will finally get married?

SAM
(to Lily)
They're not married?

LILY
I told you that. Burt wants to, but
Verona doesn’t see the point.

SAM
The point? Insurance, for one. If
anyone, you should understand that,
Bart. Does anyone ever call you
Bart? That’d be sort of funny.

BURT
No.

SAM
Well, we didn’t have insurance when
Ashley was born.

LILY
We thought we did and then we
didn’t. And I couldn't get it --
pre-existing condition.

Burt and Verona are expected to know what this condition is,
but they don’t. She twirls her finger around her ear.

LILY
I'm crazy.

A wild giggle escapes her mouth.
40.

LILY
Or whatever.

SAM
(pointing to Ashley with
his thumb)
That girl cost us $24,000. Had to
borrow from every relative we were
still speaking to.

LILY
Every time she’s acting up or
whatever, you can’t help thinking,
“We shelled out 24-thou for this?”

Lily lets out a cackle. She thinks she’s hilarious.

LILY
(laying a hand on Ashley’s
shoulder)
You know I’m kidding, honey.

Ashley wants to disappear.

VERONA
I just don’t think the certificate
and a huge wedding will change the
way we feel about each other.

LILY
At the very least, it’1l keep you
from taking off in the middle of
the night when there’s trouble.

Sam is nodding vigorously.

LILY
I almost left Sam about a dozen
times. The kids don’t know that.

The kids, of course, are right in front of them.

LILY
But then you start thinking of the
wedding, all that money--

SAM
(pouring himself another
full cup of chardonnay)
$46,000 for ours. It was worth
maybe $31.
41.

LILY

(sighing)
I hope you guys move here. We’re
having a hell of a time getting
into the social world here. Seems
very cliquish. Or maybe it’s
something about Sam they don’t
like. I don’t know what it is. We
didn’t get into the good golf club.

SAM
Run by a Pakistani couple! How do
you like that? My family goes back
to the Santa Maria. I get turned
down by a Paki named Taqi.

Lily and Sam are greatly amused by this, though it’s clear
he’s used this anecdote a few dozen times.

LILY
You really think you might come
down here?

VERONA
(looking around, as if
judging the liveability
of Phoenix based on the
dog track)
Well...

LILY

Okay, it’s not perfect. But what
is? No place is perfect, just like
no marriage is perfect. Sam and I
have both had...

(searching for an

appropriate word)
dalliances, and we're still
plugging away. Good as ever. But
families are fucked up. They’re
created that way. There’s no way
around it, so there’s no use
pretending it can be all roses and
love and that shit.

EXT. PARKING LOT OF DOG TRACK -- EVENING
LILY

(gushing, utterly sincere)
Well, that was wonderful.
42.

Sam walks by, throws the bottle of wine, now empty, loudly
into the garbage can, and heads into the parking lot to find
the car. The kids shuffle after him. He says nothing to Burt
and Verona -- he’s either too drunk or has forgotten them
completely.

LILY
You know, people will offer all
sorts of advice to you, but
whatever you do, don’t listen to
any of it. Kids are resilient --
and they're genetically
predetermined anyway. They’1ll be
fine no matter what.

Ashley has wandered off and is leaning into the window of a
pickup truck -- talking to two middle-aged cowboys. Taylor is
nearby, picking gum off the hot cement.

EXT. HOTEL POOL, PHOENIX -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Burt and Verona are sitting on deck chairs by the pool,
positioned side-by-side, very much like sunbathers. It’s
about 9 o’clock and quite dark.

BURT
You think that’s right, that all
families are inherently screwed up,
that we can’t hope for any kind of
normal happiness?

VERONA
I don’t.

Beat. The sound of crickets.

BURT
Wait. You don’t what? You don’t
think it’s possible, or you don’t
agree with her?

VERONA
You know I don’t agree, Burt. I
hate that attitude -- “Everything's

broken so let’s
(putting her feet on the
ground and stomping, as
if crushing the shards of
a vase into dust)
break everything again and again
and again.”
43.

BURT
But you’re the one who won’t get
married. If you’re so optimistic...

VERONA
But it’s beside the point! I’m
saying we can be perfect, we can be
happy, and it doesn’t have anything
to do with paper titles or a ring
or a $42,000 wedding-- Was it
$42,000?

BURT
It was, but it was only worth $31.

They chuckle and stare into the starry sky.

BURT
Did you hear what Lily was saying
about her boobs? Did you know her
when she had boobs?

VERONA
She was huge.

This is very disturbing news to Burt. He hadn’t thought of
this, and would miss Verona’s medium-sized chest.

BURT
Oh god.

INT. HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Burt and Verona are moving about the room, unpacking and
changing into their sleep clothes.

BURT
So how do you prevent that? You
don’t wanna go flat, do you?

VERONA
No, but I don’t know how much
control I have over it.

BURT
Was your mom... Did she breastfeed
you guys?

VERONA

I don’t know.
44,

BURT
You don’t know?

VERONA
She died when I was twenty-four. I
didn’t get around to asking her.

INT. HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS
Burt and Verona are laying in bed. Burt is rubbing stretch-
mark cream on Verona’s stomach and hips. It’s a delicate

moment, but Burt can’t leave the subject alone.

He jumps up and grabs Verona’s wallet and finds her pictures
of her parents.

VERONA
What are you looking for?
BURT
Did your mom have... I can’t tell

from these...

VERONA
She looked like me, Burt.

BURT
After she had you guys, too?

Burt is beginning to brighten.

VERONA
Yes.

Now Burt realizes he shouldn’t be grinning about the size of
Verona’s dead mother’s breasts. He takes a more studious
approach.

BURT
But she might not have breast-fed
you guys...

VERONA

Please, Burt.

BURT
What?
VERONA
This is the most interest you've
ever shown in my mother, and it’s
about her boobs. It’s making me not
like you.

BURT

I just think we need to do the
research. I think we need to know
what kind of strategies there might
be. I mean, I see plenty of older
women who still have their boobs.
So there must be a way to keep
them. You like your boobs, right?

VERONA
Yes.
BURT
So you’d want to keep them if you
could...
VERONA
Sure.
BURT

Good. So I’'ll do the research. I’1l
figure out what it takes. I’m sure
there are some guidelines.

Beat.
BURT

Some tricks. Together we'll do
this. I’1l do this. For you.

INT. HOTEL -- LATER, CONTINUOUS

45.

Burt and Verona are laying in bed, spooning, each looking out

the window at the pulsing highway beyond.

BURT
I have good news.

VERONA
What?

Burt turns onto his back and stares at the ceiling,
folded across his chest.

his hands
46.

BURT
I decided wood-carving is just as
good as cobbling.
(now whispering, with much
gravitas)
Our daughter's father will be a
wood-carver.

He puts his leg over hers. She reaches back, grabbing his
ass, and pulls him closer. They drift off to sleep.

INT. CAR -- DRIVING TO SISTER’S HOTEL

Burt and Verona are driving to meet her sister, Grace. Grace
works as a concierge at a very high-end hotel in Phoenix.
Burt is driving, and this is a problem. He tends to push the
accelerator down in bursts, making anyone in his vehicle
seasick.

VERONA
This is why I don’t let you drive.

BURT
Tell me one more time why we’re not
staying at the hotel where your
sister works?

VERONA
They’ve been booked for year. A
conference of Belgians who now live
in the southwest.

BURT
No. Belgians?

As Burt pulls the car into the hotel parking lot, he sees
three men, perhaps Belgian, walking on the sidewalk. He honks
angrily.

BURT
What the fuck with the Belgians all
of a sudden? For thirty-three years
I have no interaction with Belgians
and now they’re fucking up every
aspect of my life.

Burt honks at another group of Belgians, this batch including
some children. They look startled and utterly innocent.

Burt parks the car. Verona adjusts her dress over her belly
and turns to Burt.
VERONA
Listen. Grace has been dating some
guy named Rob, who seems nice but
she thinks he’s boring. He likes
going to steakhouses, that kind of
thing.

BURT
Wait, was that a good thing, or a
bad thing, the steakhouses?

VERONA
Bad.

BURT
Like an Outback Steakhouse? Ruth’s
Chris Steak House?

VERONA
I honestly don’t know. But we need
to make him seem cool. She likes
you, Burt. She’1l value your
endorsement of this guy.

They get out of the car and make their way through the
parking lot.

BURT
So you want me to make steakhouses
sound cool?

VERONA
And sherbet.

BURT
No. Not sherbet.

VERONA
Apparently Rob’s family lives
around here and they had her over
for dinner. They served sherbet.
(registering Burt’s
confusion)
Instead of sorbet. This was a big
deal for Grace. It made her sad.

Burt is still at a loss.

VERONA
We just need to make him seem like
a good, decent man. And also an
exciting sort of guy. I don’t know.
(MORE )

47.
48.

VERONA (cont'd)
We'll figure it out. And don’t look
at her tits.

BURT
I’m over it. I was good last time.

VERONA
But she’s bigger now. She went on
the pill and now she’s complaining
about getting new bras and
everything.

Burt's eyes light up.

BURT
Huh....

There’s a long pause, where Burt tries to figure out the best
way to make his suggestion, and while it dawns on Verona that
he’s about to say what he’s about to say.

BURT
Why don’t you go on the pill?

VERONA
I’m pregnant, moron.

INT. HOTEL -- LUNCHTIME

While waiting for Grace, Verona and Burt see a MOM with her
two kids, 5 and eighteen months. The mother, white, is
talking to her kids very loudly, as if everyone nearby should
be interested in hearing what she says to her children -- and
all aspects of her fascinating child-rearing.

MOM
Yes, Martin Luther! That’s a fern!

Burt and Verona keep watching. Verona is getting annoyed.

MOM
Yes, that’s a cactus. And the
plural of cactus is...

MARTIN LUTHER
Cacti?

MOM
That's right! Oh Amelie, you've
dribbled on your new French dress!
49.

The mom looks around, expecting everyone in the vicinity to
smile at the wonder of childhood and her spectacular little
family. She finds only Verona, staring her down with a look
of unmitigated disgust.

VERONA
(to Burt, between her
teeth)
Performance moms. Nothing goes un-
narrated.

BURT
There’s Grace.

Grace is saying goodbye to a group of Belgians. She sends
them onto their tour bus and turns to see Verona and Burt.

GRACE
Hi!

VERONA
Hey!

GRACE

Wow, look at you! Finally showing!
You are radiant! Luminous!
Effervescent! Hey Burt!

She gives Burt a quick but very tight hug. She and Verona
think nothing of it, but Burt is in a momentary daze.

GRACE
You guys want to eat here, or go
out...?

BURT

We don’t want to go out there...
for a while. Feels like we’re being
cooked.

GRACE
Yeah, it’s hot.

BURT
No, I mean truly. Think about it.
If you were actually being cooked
by someone, that’s what it would
feel like. As if God had formed us
from clay, but it was the kind of
clay you needed to bake, as opposed
to the kind you just leave out to
dry.
50.

GRACE
(meaning it)
Wow, Burt. That is so stoney!

BURT
Well, it’s the Bible. QED.

INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT -- MIDDAY
Mid-conversation:

GRACE

Two days ago he asked me if I like
movies. Like movies are something
some people don’t like. He actually
posed the question like it was some
great conversation-starter.

(imitating his voice)
“Do you like movies?”

(looking into her salad)
It was painful.

BURT
I wish someone would ask me that
sometime. That’s a probing sort of
intelligence, I think.

GRACE
Really?

BURT
He doesn’t assume the obvious.

GRACE
But the way he dresses! He wears
basketball jerseys without any
shirt underneath.

BURT
It’s Phoenix.

GRACE
But he’s so white!

BURT
Is he buff?

GRACE
No.
51.

BURT
Most basketball players aren’t. Or
they didn’t use to be. You ever see
the Celtics from the 70s? They were
mostly white and not very buff. Is
this guy from Boston?

GRACE
I think his family is from Boston.
BURT
There you go.
GRACE
He drives a Cabriolet.
BURT
Great design. Good mileage.
GRACE
He uses the word “robust.”
BURT
Lots of things are robust!
GRACE
He took me to Long John Silver's.
BURT
(to Verona)
I thought you said it was a
steakhouse.
GRACE

When I told him I didn’t want the
steakhouse, he took me to Long John
Silver's.

BURT
He’s being sensitive to your needs
and desires. You say no turf, he
goes surf. He’s a quick thinker.

GRACE
But every time I have an issue with
something, he just accommodates me.
I tell him not to wear bleached
jeans and he doesn’t wear them. I
think he read somewhere that he’s
supposed to laugh at my jokes, so
for a week he would literally
double-over every time I made an
attempt. Like this:

(MORE )
GRACE (cont'd)
(she demonstrates by
throwing her head
forward)
You know, like even when he was
driving. I had to ask him to stop.

Verona gives Burt a look, like he needs to step up for Rob.

BURT
This guy seems like a goddamned
champ, Grace. He seems awesome. I’d
marry him if it wasn’t against the
law here.

Grace now sees through the gambit. Verona gives Burt a

withering look.

BURT
I’ll get the check.

Burt leaves the table and walks to the front desk.

seconds, he’s talking to the woman there, older and with a

sizable chest.

VERONA
Look at him. We’re having a baby
that might have three feet or one
eye and the thing he’s most worried
about is whether or not I‘’1ll keep
my boobs.

GRACE
I think that’s sexy.

Burt returns. He winks at Verona, like he’s got news for

later.

BURT
So I’m meeting Rob at the driving
range?

GRACE
Yeah. Hey thanks, Burt. It means a
lot to me. Just... get a feel for
him.

(mock-dramatically)
Tell me if I can be as happy with
him as Rona is with you.

Young Martin Luther, son of the Performance Mom, has appeared

at their table.
53.

KID
(pointing to Verona’s
stomach)
Baby!
PERFORMANCE MOM
(delighted)
Right, Martin Luther! This woman is
about to have a baby -- any day
now!
VERONA

Or in three months.
(giving the mom a fake
smile)

Thank you.

The kid is still at Verona’s side, inspecting her. The
Performance Mom thinks she has an audience and is thus more
delighted than ever.

PERFORMANCE MOM
Martin Luther, tell the pretty lady
what you know about babies.

The boy says nothing. He’s frozen up.

PERFORMANCE MOM
C’mon, tell the nice people.

The boy directs a malevolent look at his baby sister.

PERFORMANCE MOM
Martin. You’re being rude--

KID

(still staring at his

sister)
Babies like to breathe and are good
at hiding it. I put a pillow over a
baby and I thought she wasn’t
breathing but then she was. She was
sneaky. She was breathing the whole
time. But I’1l try again.

Ashen-faced, the Performance Mom and her kids leave.
Burt’s phone rings.
BURT
I’m gonna take this on the way to

meeting Rob. I’1l see you guys
later.
54.

He leaves.

BURT

(on phone, in loud, Casey

Kasem voice)
Ned! I can’t believe you're not
hiding under a rock with the way
your Titans played last Sunday! Ha
ha ha... What? Yes siree I had
money on it!

Grace wistfully watches him walk away.

GRACE
You got lucky, sister.

Verona ponders this for a second. She’s inclined to cut the
compliment with self-deprecating humor, but she refrains.

VERONA
Yeah. I know.

INT. BATHTUB SHOWROOM

Verona and Grace are walking through the aisles, touching the
bathtubs and fixtures. This is a high-end showroom for
decorators, and people with a lot of disposable income.

VERONA
So what would you think if we moved
here? You could be Auntie Grace all
the time. We could drive Burt
crazy.

GRACE
I would love it, Rone. You have no
idea. But I don’t know if I’m here
for the long haul.

VERONA
But you’re looking at seven-
thousand-dollar tubs!

GRACE
I can sell my house for twice what
I paid for it. I can live five
years off the profit. So... I just
might do that. I don’t know. And I
wouldn’t want you moving all the
way here just to see me leave.

They walk through the showroom.
55.

VERONA
It’s strange how we live, don’t you
think?

GRACE

How do you mean?

VERONA
You’re younger than me, you're
single, and you live in a 4,000-
square-foot house. Burt and I are
having a baby and we rent a three-
room ranch.

GRACE
It’s only because I try when it
comes to money, Rone. You have your
head in other places. I’m always
going to be good at making money
because I like making money. Why?
Because I’m good at it. I don’t
have a talent like you do.

VERONA
My talent is drawing people's
organs. I wouldn’t glamorize it too
much.

GRACE
Get in.

Grace is sitting inside a large white tub set atop giant claw
feet.

VERONA
I don’t need to get in. It’s a nice
tub.
(now really looking at it,
noticing something)
Looks like the one we used to have

at home.

GRACE
Come on. I’1l pretend to wash your
hair.

Verona sheepishly steps into the tub and sits with her back
to Grace. Grace takes her hair into her hands and kneads it,
pretending to lather shampoo into it.

GRACE
When was the last time you went
back?
56.

VERONA
Home? I haven’t. Not for ... a
while. When are you gonna sell that
place, anyway?

GRACE
You mean when are we going to sell *
it?

VERONA

I told you I don’t want anything to
do with it. You did the estate
sale, you sell the house, too.

GRACE
I feel funny selling it at the
prices they’re offering. I’m going
to wait -- I have a feeling the
neighborhood's going to turn
around. Just need some families to
come back.

+e * HF

VERONA
It’s weird to think the baby won't
have grandparents from our side.

GRACE
Yeah...

VERONA
It hits you again when these things
come up. When there are places they
should be but can’t be.

GRACE
Ah ha.
VERONA
What?
GRACE
Now I know why you won’t marry that
good man.
VERONA

That’s not it.

GRACE
You don’t want to have Uncle Mark
or someone else walking you down
the aisle...
57.

VERONA
It’s not--

GRACE
And giving you away! That would be
sad, I guess. I can understand
that. I’m not looking forward to it
myself. Maybe I’1l elope...

Verona’s eyes are wet, but Grace can’t see this. They sit in
silence for a moment.

GRACE
It’s not good to think about.

VERONA
No, it’s not.

GRACE
Let's go.

Grace steps out of the tub and then offers Verona a hand up.
Verona struggles but gets herself up and out.

INT. HOTEL -- EVENING

Verona is on the floor, doing pre-natal yoga stretches. Burt
bursts in.

BURT
That was the most boring afternoon
of my life.

He throws himself against the wall, as if shipwrecked and
finally finding dry land.

BURT
It’s hard to explain. He was
wearing Dockers. Everywhere -- on

his legs, on his head, his feet...

VERONA
Thanks for not saying anything to
Grace.

BURT

He had a Dockers shirt, a Dockers
phone holster...

VERONA
I’m sorry, honey.
58.

BURT
I can’t figure out how a guy can be
that boring. Even while he was
boring me, I thought maybe I could
study it, like, be interested in
how boring he was. But even that
failed. I was bored by being bored
by him. It was unprecedented.

VERONA
Well, I know she probably won't
stay with this guy, but at least we
might ween her off the bad boys.
Since high school all she wants is
the bad boys. Even the guy she was
engaged to was a bad boy.

BURT
The florist?
VERONA
Yeah.
BURT
The florist from Japan was a bad
boy?
VERONA
He was really rebellious.
BURT
What... Too much baby’s breath?

That kind of thing?
Verona is struggling to get off the floor.

VERONA
I’m so tired of being big.

Burt helps her up.

VERONA
I’m tired of not having sex.

BURT
Do you want to have sex?

VERONA
No.

Burt stares blankly.
59.

VERONA

We haven’t had sex in a month.
BURT

But you don’t want to have it now.
VERONA

No.
BURT

We had sex last week.

VERONA
No. You came on my boobs.

BURT
Oh. Right.
(quickly losing himself in
a reverie)

VERONA
It‘’‘ll be months before I get my
shape back.

BURT
So we don’t have sex for a while. I
was prepared for that. This is one
of those dips we go through. There
are periods when you don’t have
sex, Rone. I mean, what if I got
into a horrible boating accident,
and was covered in third-degree
burns on most of my body? We’d do
without sex then, right?

Verona can’t believe this. She grabs the ice bucket and heads
to the door. She stops.

VERONA
I’m pregnant, Burt. You didn’t get
in a boating accident. And how do
you get burns in a boating
accident?
(opening the door)
We don’t even HAVE a boat.

BURT
Yeah but--

She closes the door on him. Relief. We follow her all the way
down the hall, in utter silence. She savors the quiet, the
respite from Burt’s mouth.
60.

She gets the ice, and when returning, slows down as she comes
upon the door, almost knowing that as soon she opens it,
he’1l begin again -- as if the conversation had never paused.

She takes a breath. She opens the door. She was right.

BURT
Funny you mentioned not having a
boat. I meant to talk to you about
that. I want the baby to grow up
knowing the joys of the high seas.
I want to raise her on the water. I
want the salt water running through
her veins!

Verona throws herself onto the bed and buries her face in her
pillow. Burt misinterprets this as a sign that she’s still
upset about being big.

BURT
Rona? C’mon. Don’t be sad. You’re
not that big. And you’re still
super-sexy. Hot even.

She buries her face deeper.

BURT
Oh honey. I’11 always love you,
even if you're enormous. Even if it
takes you MONTHS to lose the
weight! A year! I‘’1l love you
always, Rone -- even if you GAIN
weight after the baby.

Verona makes no sign she’s hearing him.

BURT
(now quieter, as if he’s
saying something really
poignant now)
Even if you gain so much weight I
can’t find your vagina.

She screams into the pillow.

BURT
(now whispering)
Really. You can write that in
stone, in your heart. I ... will
-». love you ... even if... I can’t
find your vagina.
61.

INT. PLANE -- ON WAY TO HARTFORD

Verona is listening to the baby’s heartbeat with a portable
Doppler machine.

VERONA
Her heart-rate is still pretty
slow.
BURT
What is it?
VERONA
Like 115.
BURT
That’s normal enough, right?
VERONA
It’s supposed to be between 120 and
160.
BURT

She's just mellow. Mellow’s good.

VERONA
I don’t want mellow now. I want
lively now, mellow later.

BURT
I think it’s fine.

VERONA
It’s because you don’t want to
fight. We should fight more. Get
her riled up.

BURT
Didn't we fight last night?

VERONA
We discussed. We need to fight. You
never raise your voice.

BURT
Fine. Okay... You did something
wrong and I’m mad about it. Man, I
am cross. Real mad.

VERONA
No. It has to be convincing.
62.

BURT
Should I swear?

VERONA
No. Just raise your voice.

BURT
(suddenly screaming)
You cunt-sucker!

Half the plane turns.

VERONA
(in an urgent whisper)
I didn’t mean now!

BURT
But the element of surprise is
crucial! You’ve never heard me say
cunt-sucker, have you?

Verona has sunk so low in her seat that she’s talking into
her breasts.

VERONA
No!

BURT
See? I’ll get that heartrate up.
I know what I’m doing.

He pats her hand. She’s still recovering.

INT. CAR -- DRIVING TO HARTFORD CAMPUS

They drive through a nice part of Hartford, and the beginning
of a tree-filled college campus.

VERONA
This is nice.
BURT
Yeah. I haven’t seen Ellen in... I

have no idea when I saw her last.
VERONA

I can’t believe you thought to call

her.

Beat.
63.

BURT
Shit! My interview!

VERONA
It’s tomorrow.

BURT
How do you know?

She opens his jacket. The itinerary is no longer stapled to
the lining of his jacket.

VERONA
What did you do with it?

Burt smiles. He’s got it figured out. He reaches down and
takes off his shoe. He looks, but finds nothing inside. Now
the other shoe. Nothing.

VERONA
What?

BURT
I wore the wrong shoes.

They drive onto campus.

VERONA
So is Ellen a full professor, or an
associate or...? And which side is
she on -- she’s a first cousin?

BURT
Well, she’s not technically my
cousin. Her mom was an old friend
of my dad’s. I have no idea how.
They started calling us cousins
when we were kids. You met her at
my brother's wedding.

VERONA
She seemed really angry. She called
the band racist.

BURT
She doesn’t think white people
should play soul music.
Verona scoffs.

BURT
Be nice.
64.

EXT. AFTERNOON -- SMALL COLLEGE CAMPUS

They get out of their car and look around. Burt is trying to
call Ellen; he gets no answer.

VERONA
You didn’t get the address?

BURT
She told me to call when I got to
campus.

The first person they see is a professor -- a woman of about
38, with a baby in a stroller.

BURT
Excuse me. You wouldn’t happen to
know where Ellen Forney-Fisher’s
office is?

PROFESSOR
Ellen Forney-Fisher.
(she says the name with a
remarkable amount of
distaste)
Well I do know, as a matter of
fact. She’s in Altgeld Hall. Room
340. In the corner.

BURT
You think she’s there now? We’re
early.

PROFESSOR

Well, if she’s not in her office,
she’ll probably be around campus.
She'll be the mom without the
stroller.

They thank the professor and head toward Altgeld.

INT. ALTGELD HALL -- DAYTIME

They're walking through the halls of the building, looking
for the room number.

VERONA
She doesn’t have a stroller? I
thought you said she got some big
trust fund.

 %

+ eH
65.

BURT
She did. Her mother married a
Vanderbilt. Or a Carnegie. Which
one did the pants?

They arrive at the office. The door says LN HYLAND.

VERONA
I thought her name was Ellen. What
does L N stand for?

It dawns on Verona that “Ellen” is spelled “LN.”

VERONA
No.

BURT
She must have changed it. Don’t say
anything about it. Please.

He knocks on the door.

LN (0.S.)
It’s open!

They open the door upon a horrifying sight. There is a woman
standing behind a desk. The woman has one baby in a sling,
and this baby is sucking on her left nipple. On the desk
stands a four-year-old boy. He is sucking on her right
nipple.

LN
(waving)
Hello!

The four-year-old peels his lips from the nipple and waves,
too.

FOUR-YEAR-OLD
Welcome!

LN gestures them forward, in a “Come in! Come in!” sort of
way. Burt and Verona are frozen. LN is about 37, blond,
attractive, with luxurious curly hair. She’s wearing a woven
poncho.

LN
Come here, give me kisses!

Verona and Burt proceed, their feet leaden.

+ eH
66.

LN tucks her breasts back under her blouse and charges toward
Burt and Verona. The four-year-old wipes his mouth with the
back of his hand.

LN
How are you two? Look at you!
You're hardly showing! What a
beauty you are, Verona. I thought
something might have been wrong
when you were so late.

BURT
Sorry about that. I blacked out.

LN

How inventive! You used to be so
prompt, Burt. What are you doing to
him, Verona? He was always on
time... C’mon.

(getting her bag and

indicating the four-year-

old)
I have to get this one to crafting.

The four-year-old puts on what seems to be a coat -- no, it’s
a cape, black and velvet -- and they all leave the office.
EXT. CAMPUS -- LATE-LATE AFTERNOON

They're walking through the quad, on the way to their cars.

BURT
Sorry about that. We tried to call
you.

LN

Oh yeah. I never answer the phone
when I’m feeding. Not fair to the
children.

They walk past a protest -- dozens of students with signs
(THE CIA TRAINED BIN LADEN) objecting to CIA recruiting on
campus.

BURT
We got directions from a woman. She
seemed to know you. She had a baby,
very tall?

LN
Oh god. Ruby Eng. She hates me. I
breastfed her baby.
67.

VERONA
You what?

LN
I was babysitting and the child was
fussing -- he was starving, didn’t

want the bottle. So I fed him. Took
to me right away. I shouldn't have
told her; she didn’t appreciate it.
She has lactation problems. Now she
won’t let me babysit, or get near
her husband. How paranoid is that?
So should we eat in? Out?

BURT
How about in? We’ve been traveling
all day. Staying home would be so

nice.

LN
Okay... Let’s think of what I have
at home...

VERONA

Let us get the food! We have a car.
We can go to the store and get
whatever we need. It would be our
pleasure.

LN
Oh that’s great. Look at you, so
helpful. I guess it’s in the blood.

Verona has to take a second to figure out how many ways she
was just insulted. They’re still walking through campus.

LN
I’m so glad you guys got pregnant
so easily. To be honest, I had my
doubts, given Verona’s tilted
uterus. Oh, here I am.
(indicating her car -- a
Prius)
I’1ll see you at the house.

INT. RENTAL CAR -- ON WAY TO GROCERY STORE

Verona is driving. Fuming.
68.

VERONA
(furious)
You told her I have a tilted
uterus?

BURT
I don’t know. It might have been my
mom. Is your tilted uterus a

secret?

VERONA
Yeah my tilted uterus is a fucking
secret!

Something occurs to Burt.

BURT
Oh really, you fucking bitch? Your
fucking uterus is a motherfucking
secret? Well fuck you!

Verona is shocked.
Burt grabs the Doppler from the bag.

CUT TO:

INT. GROCERY STORE -- AFTERNOON
Burt is pushing the cart through the aisles.

BURT
Why don't we divide up? You get the
wine and some beer and I'll get the
pasta and vegetables.

VERONA
I don't want to get the wine.
People give me bad looks when I buy
wine.

BURT
You're being totally paranoid.
Rone, you have to trust me on this.
Nobody even notices you now that
you're pregnant.

VERONA
That's supposed to make me feel
better?
69.

Verona goes to the wine section. She selects a few bottles,
red and white, and a six-pack of beer. As she makes her way
back to Burt's cart, heads are turning, old women are
whispering. A mother pushing her child in a cart hisses.

She reunites with Burt near the checkout line.

BURT
We need a gift.

VERONA
Oh god. Really?

BURT
We should. My parents will kill me
if we don’t.
(alighting on an idea)
A stroller! They don’t have one!
We'll be heroes. Look!

He points out the window, across the parking lot, to a BABIES
R US.

VERONA
If you check out, I’1l get the
stroller.

Burt is suddenly distracted. He’s spotted one of the check-
out women, about 50, with large breasts.

BURT
(already making his way to
the checkout)
Good plan, good...

CUT TO:

EXT. BABY STORE
Verona loading a stroller into the back of the car.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. GROCERY STORE

Burt is talking intensely with the large-breasted checkout
woman. He’s got the checkout pen (the one on the spiral cord)
and he’s taking notes on an empty paper bag.

BURT
So you're saying the trick is--

a * + FH FH HH FF

*
70.

WOMAN
You gotta stop breastfeeding at 6
months.

BURT
Interesting...

There’s a loud buzzing or beeping sound from outside. Burt
and the woman briefly look up but then resume their
conversation.
WOMAN
And drink whole milk. And beer,
lots of beer. Good for the mams.
BURT
(admiring her chest)
They ARE good...

The noise from outside continues. They again look up, trying
to find the source of all the racket.

WOMAN
And the thing about stretchmarks--
Wait. Is she with you?
They both look up to see:

CUT TO:

INT. CAR
Verona leaning on the horn. It’s been her the whole time,
watching Burt through the glass, furious.
INT. LN’S HOUSE -- EVENING
Burt and Verona ring the bell.
VERONA
One question about LN’s boobs and I
throw you through that window.

She's pointing to a second-story window.

BURT
That one, huh? Okay. Gotcha.

LN opens the door, wearing a long flowing hippie robe-dress --
something like Joseph’s technicolor dreamcoat.

*
71.

LN
Namaste! *
Burt and Verona = blank looks. *
LN *
Come in! Come in! The spirit within *
me salutes the spirit within you! *

They step inside. We see that there's an elaborate cubby-hole *
like set-up of shoes and slippers.

LN
If you don’t mind...

Verona picks out a pair of black knitted slippers. Burt is
left with one option: an elf-like pair, with pointed toes.

Welcome to greater Hartford! *
VERONA
Here, we brought you something. *
Burt goes back to the porch to retrieve it. *
LN

(to Verona)
That is so sweet. Aren't you a
dumpling?

Burt presents the stroller, assembled, to LN. LN looks at it
like a rolling mound of pig shit is coming toward her.

LN
Oh no... no, no. We don’t use
those. No. Take it away.

BURT
What?

LN
This is my house. Respect that, at
LEAST! Take that thing away.
Burt begins to roll the stroller into a side room. *

LN
No! The porch. The door! Out!

Burt opens the front door and wheels it out. *
72.

BURT
What the hell, LN?

LN
Burt. I love my babies. Why would I
push them away from me like that?
(demonstrating with an
aggressive move of
pushing a stroller, as if
off a cliff)
No. We do continuum here.
(in a hush, still
traumatized)
Yes. Continuum.

VERONA
What is that -- continuum?

LN
Continuum?

VERONA
Yes.

LN
(as if any mother-to-be
should know)
Continuum.

LN and Verona stare each other down for a second.

VERONA
Please, LN, you should just cut the
shit and tell me.

Burt raises his eyebrows.

VERONA
(to Burt)
Sorry.
(faux-sweetly, to LN)
I can’t wait to hear.

Verona’s tone can’t keep LN from preaching the gospel.

LN
The Continuum movement recognizes
that the world will give your baby
plenty of alienation and despair in
good time, so while we can we
should hold them close.
73.

BURT
So you can’t push the kid ina
stroller?

LN
No, no. Why do you think this
country is so dysfunctional? Why we
feel disconnected from our homes
and loved ones?

VERONA
Because of strollers?

LN
In this house we carry the
children. We keep them attached. We
don’t sever the biological ties at
first opportunity.

BURT
What about sleeping?

CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY BEDROOM

Burt and Verona are standing behind LN, who is showing them a
smallish, dimly lit, wood-paneled bedroom, dominated entirely
by a huge mattress. It’s almost twice the size of a king-size
bed.

LN
We have one bed. Sleep-time is
their most fraught time, when they
most need to know that their
progenitors are near. Hi Roderick.

It wasn’t clear at first, but RODERICK, LN’s partner, is
laying on the bed. Roderick is tall, lanky, with longish
dirty-blond hair and a broad open face. He turns over and
greets them with a lazy wave. Both kids -- WOLF, 4, and
NEPTUNE, 2 -- are laying with him, attached, in slings. They
look barely able to breathe.

BURT
Hi. I don’t think we’ve met.

Burt tries to crawl over the bed on his knees, to shake
Roderick’s hand. Roderick makes almost no effort.

RODERICK
Yes we have. Burning Man. 1997.

74.

Verona looks at Burt, aghast. Burt quietly acknowledges that
this is true.

Burt and Verona take in the room. There are about two dozen
pictures of seahorses on the walls.

VERONA
What about sex?

RODERICK
What about it?

VERONA
You go out to the car or what?

LN
No we don’t go out to the car. Are
you planning to hide your
lovemaking from your kids, Burt? Do
you know what that does to a child,
to have their parents’ expression
of love kept a secret from them?

RODERICK
That’s why I have an Electra
Complex.
BURT
Which one is that again?
VERONA
That’s when a woman wants to do her

father.
(to Roderick)
Do you mean Oedipal Complex?

RODERICK
Don’t try to diagnose me, Verona.

BURT

(nodding toward the
paintings)

Why the seahorses, Rod?

Roderick tries to answer, but emotion has overcome him.
LN
In the seahorse community, the
males give birth.

She gives Roderick a sympathetic look, as if to apologize.
75.

RODERICK
The female inserts her ovipositor
into the male’s brood pouch. That’s
where she deposits her eggs.

LN
(with such tenderness)
If I could, I would lay my eggs in
your brood pouch.

RODERICK
(barely choking out the
words )
I know you would.

Burt and Verona are utterly stricken.

CUT TO:

INT. LN’S HOUSE -- EVENING -- DINNER TABLE

At dinner, Verona, Burt, Roderick and LN are joined by LN’s
son, WOLF, the four-year-old, wearing a sweater hand-made
from hemp. NEPTUNE is on LN’s lap, playing with something on
LN’s neck -- it appears to be a vial of blood.

LN
It’s so good to have you two here.

VERONA
(looking at the placemats,
which look like abstract
watercolors)
These are very unusual.

LN
Wolfie and Neptune helped make
them. Didn't you, Wolfie?

Wolf nods proudly.

RODERICK
So are you counting on this job
interview tomorrow? At.. Where is
it?

BURT
Providential. Not really. I already
do fine. This would just be a
better commission rate.

+e HF FF *

 %
76.

RODERICK
It’s weird what you do, isn’t it,
Burt? You sort of make money from
people’s fears. The more the
government and the media scares us,
the more cash you haul in.

Burt doesn’t take Roderick very seriously.

BURT
Nice to see you out of bed,
Roderick.

FOUR-YEAR-OLD
Would you like a dolma?

BURT
What is it?

FOUR-YEAR-OLD
It’s an amuse-bouche.

BURT
What?

FOUR-YEAR-OLD
It means “pleasing to the mouth.”
To whet your appetite.

BURT
Okay. Right. Thank you.

He takes one.

LN
Have you decided on a doula?

BURT
(holding up the appetizer
Wolf gave him)
I have one. Delicious.

LN
A doula, not a dolma.

VERONA
We're not using a doula.

LN
A midwife?
77.

BURT

(finally catching on)
Nope. No. Midwifes and doulas are
for when the husband is clueless or
doesn’t want to be involved. I am
neither of those things. You know,
I did successfully apply a
tourniquet to a man and I've been
doing some reading about the birth
process...

LN
The tourniquet? I was there. It was
camp. We were twelve. Don’t you
think Verona might need someone who
understands the female experience?

VERONA
We haven't decided yet exactly what
we're doing--

BURT
We don’t need some stranger in the
delivery room who looks like Joan

Baez.
LN
Who what?
BURT
You know this is true. Every
midwife I’ve seen -- they always

look like Joan Baez. You know, with

the short hair and the
(demonstrating)

pointy, lady sideburns.

LN
(changing the subject)
How’s Jim?

BURT
My parents are fine, LN. They’re
moving to Belgium.

LN
Belgium? Whose idea was that?
Sounds like Glenda’s.

BURT
What does that mean?
78.

LN
Uncle Jim was always more of a
romantic. He wouldn’t have chosen
Belgium. Don’t tell me they’re
going to Antwerp.

BURT
Just stop. You’re way inappropriate
about my dad. And don’t call him
Uncle Jim. He’s not your uncle.

Just ... gah.
VERONA
Burt-—
BURT

Dammit, LN, you've always done
this. You and your mom always got
too involved in my family. We
really -- just don’t give us advice
about the birth, okay?

RODERICK
Alice Walker says there’s nothing
more important than how you enter
this world, and I agree with her.
My mom had a hospital birth -- the
stirrups, the drugs, the machines.
And she wonders why I can’t hold
down a job, why I can’t walk into a
dry cleaners without vomiting. It’s
astonishing, her complicity in
everything. And when I’m twelve she
catches me with some peyote and I’m
like, “What’d you expect? You
started it with the epidural.”

BURT
(putting his silverware
down )
I’m going to ... put some quarters

in the parking meter.
Everyone knows there are no parking meters for miles, but no
one says a word. Burt walks out the front door.
EXT. LN’S DRIVEWAY

Verona has followed him outside. They’re standing in the
gravel driveway.
They hug,

79.

BURT
I’m sorry about that. If I didn’t
have to be almost related to her, I
wouldn’t even bother.

VERONA
It’s all right.

BURT
I swear I didn’t tell her about
your tilted uterus.

VERONA
Thanks.

and this leads to a small kiss, which leads to a

passionate one, which leads to some groping. The action is
getting heated.

VERONA
Stop.
BURT
What?
VERONA
We shouldn’t do this here.
BURT
What? Why?
VERONA

Do you know what it does to a child
to have their parents’ friends’
lovemaking kept a secret from them?
What if I came and Wolfie didn’t
get to witness it? I don’t want an
Electra complex on my conscience.
c'mon--

She takes off her shirt and pretends to walk back toward the

house.

BURT
Okay, okay. Let’s go.

He grabs her from behind and tries to lift her to wheel her
around. He grunts involuntarily -- she’s heavier than he
expected -- and never quite gets her off the ground.

INT. HOTEL -- LATER THAT NIGHT
80.

Burt and Verona are in the hotel room, both trying to
capitalize on the sexual mood.

VERONA

Okay, no more talking about LN.
BURT

Right.
VERONA

But she is nuts, right?

BURT
She’s an awful person. An unholy
union of intentions and
pretensions.

Burt is lying in the bed and Verona is putting on a
nightgown, something distinctly unflattering. We see Burt
examining the nightgown, forming a thought.

BURT
Hey Verona...

Verona immediately can sense that an unsolicited remark about
her appearance is coming.

VERONA
No thanks.
BURT
Can I tell you something?
VERONA
No. Burt. C’mon, don’t blow it.
BURT
I just want to tell you one little
thing.
VERONA

Burt, I’m helping you out here.
(kneeling on the bed,
crawling toward him)

Just stop talking. I don’t want to

hear it.

BURT
You don’t know what I’m going to
say.

VERONA

I do.
81.

Verona goes into the bathroom and closes the door. Burt gets
up and stands on the other side.

BURT
Verona. Listen.

No response.

BURT
Verona.
Nothing.
BURT
Please.
She opens the door.
VERONA
What?
BURT

I was just going to say that I
don’t think you look good in that.

She screams a frustrated scream and walks out of the room.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- LATER

Verona is sitting in the lobby, on the couch, in her
nightgown. She’s watching TV with the HOTEL MANAGER, Indian
and in his 60s. Burt takes a second to process the scene, and
then awkwardly sits between Verona and her new friend.

BURT
Sorry. I’m such a jerk.

Verona says nothing. There are tears of frustration in her
eyes. She gets up and walks toward the elevator. Burt
follows.

BURT
Man am I stupid.

Nothing from Verona.
82.

INT. ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

BURT
I am the worst. I know it.

Verona seems to be softening.

INT. HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

They walk in and Burt embraces Verona from behind, his hands
around her waist. Verona relents, resting her hands on his.

BURT
What can I do? Say it. Anything.

Verona smiles, thinking of something.

BURT
You want me to come on your tits?

Now she bawls.

EXT. HARTFORD -- LUNCH

Burt’s interview is over. He and Verona have gathered at a
cafe. Verona is at the counter, alone.

VERONA
Can I get a small latte?

BARRISTA
Are you sure?

VERONA
Am I sure about what?

BARRISTA
It has caffeine.

VERONA
That's the point.

The barrista points to Verona’s stomach. Now Verona gets it.
VERONA
Just give me the latte, Doctor. And

a muffin.

She gets her drink and muffin and finds Burt and sits down.
He has his laptop open.
83.

VERONA

Oh god. The myth that people are
nicer to pregnant women... White
men cut me in every line because
I'm slower -- they think I’m weak.
And every woman thinks the baby’s
theirs, that I’ve asked them to
judge me. The only people who know
how to treat me are black men.

At that moment, a black man in the cafe, maybe on the
effeminate side, notices her.

BLACK MAN
The goddess is alive!

VERONA
(to Burt)
See?
(stirring her coffee)
How was the interview?

BURT
Oh god.

VERONA
What?

BURT

It was so weird. He kept saying
things about how I didn’t look like
my picture, how he expected someone

else... He was confused. It was
awkward.
VERONA
Huh.
(something dawns on her)
Oh no.
BURT
What?
VERONA

Your website.

BURT
What about it?
84.

She grabs Burt’s laptop and types in a url. Up pops Burt’s
website, which features information about insurance futures,
and Burt's business philosophy, and, over the name BURT
FARLANDER, a picture of a handsome, silver-haired 58-year-old
man, in a perfect suit, sitting on the corner of a desk.

BURT
That was your idea.

VERONA
I thought it fit the voice. Sorry.

They sit in silence.

BURT
How long till the flight leaves?
VERONA
Six hours.
Beat.
VERONA
LN signed us up for a birth class.
BURT
Of course she did.
VERONA
We haven’t been to one. We have
nothing else to do.
Beat.
VERONA
Could be funny.
INT. BIRTH CLASS -- AFTERNOON

We join Burt and Verona as they’re leaving for a mid-class
break. They file out of the room with all of the other
couples. Trailing behind is CONNIE, the woman running the
class. She looks exactly like -- or is actually played by --
Joan Baez.

CONNIE
Ten minutes and come back. The hard
part is over.
85.

VERONA
(whispering to Burt)
I'm actually surprised. This class
has been almost completely normal.

BURT
She’s not all bad.

Verona goes to the bathroom. Burt is at the vending machines
when he’s approached by a man of about 35, bearded, athletic -
- he looks like a 70s-era football player.

BEARDED GUY
You gonna watch?

BURT
Excuse me?

Burt has his hand inside the machine, trying to retrieve his
Twizzlers.

BEARDED GUY
Which side of the curtain you gonna
be on?

BURT
In the delivery room? I’1l be right
there. I’m gonna watch every
minute.

BEARDED GUY
Don’t do it.

BURT
I’m gonna do it.

BEARDED GUY
Don't do it, man. Those movies we
watched (indicating the
classroom)... They don’t show
anything.

BURT
You've been through this?

BEARDED GUY
Yeah. My first wife. Listen. How
big a man are you?
(indicating Burt’s pants)
Let's assume you’re average.

He takes Burt’s Twizzlers and peels one strand of licorice
off the bunch.
86.

BEARDED GUY
Now, for years now, your Twizzler
has had a nice, warm, compact
docking bay waiting for it, right?

Burt tries to straighten the Twizzler, which has drooped.

BEARDED GUY
Now you’re sitting in the delivery
room, thinking “miracle of life,”
“spectacle of birth,” right? But
here’s your Twizzler. And here’s
the size of a baby. Once that
humanoid comes out of your wife,
are you ever gonna be able to see
your wife’s -- excuse me -- tootie
the same way again? No sir. That
space is no longer yours. It’s like
they built a superhighway in your
childhood bedroom.

BURT
A what? Where?

BEARDED GUY
My first wife did 1000 Kegels a day
and I swear she had the loosest
slot outside of Reno. I shit you
not -- I could stick a baby right
back in there with the hole she
had. Wouldn’t need a lubricant.
Ask me how much sex we had after
that.

BURT
No.

BEARDED GUY
None. Now ask me why we got
divorced.

BURT
No.

BEARDED GUY
Ask me why my son is living in
Mexico City with a semi-
professional soccer player they
call The Bandito.

BURT
No.
87.

BEARDED GUY
Stay behind the curtain, my man.
Don’t be a hero.

CUT TO:

INT. CLASS -- LATER

There are five or six other couples there, fairly
nondescript; if anything, they’re a bit on the artsy side.
They're gathered in a semi-circle.

CONNIE
Okay gang. Now, finally: If there’s
one thing I want you to take away
from this, it’s that the
placenta...

Here she removes the towel that has been covering a jar.
Inside the jar is what appears to be some kind of long-
pickled sea squid.

VERONA
(in an urgent whisper)
Oh Jesus. No.

The squid is purple, red, and tentacled. Burt’s jaw drops
open. He loves it.

CONNIE
.-.-is not your enemy....

She lifts the jar and begins walking it around the room.

VERONA
Oh lord god.

CONNIE
It’s not some disgusting thing to
be thrown away at first
opportunity. As you may know, in
some cultures...

VERONA
That’s always bad, when they say
“in some cultures...”

Burt is still enthralled.

CONNIE
«+. the placenta is buried in the
backyard after a birth.

(MORE )
88.

CONNIE (cont'd)
In others, it’s cooked and eaten by
the family....

Burt is still wide-eyed, while Verona looks pale, and is
listing heavily, as if seasick.

CONNIE
I want to introduce another option,
one that I’ve had the pleasure of
seeing work very well with many
couples at this facility. Are there
any artists here?

All but two of the attendees raise their hands. Everyone’s an
artist. Burt raises his, too. The one actual artist in the
room, Verona, has her arms folded.

CONNIE
So you know the pleasures of
working with archival-quality
watercolor paper. Now imagine the
power of a relief print of your
placenta, if applied to high-
density archival watercolor paper.

She holds up a sample. Oohs and ahhs ensue. There is general
agreement among the attendees that this is a superb idea.

BURT
Why do those look familiar...?
VERONA
Oh no.
It dawns on Burt and Verona that this is what LN’s placemats
were -- laminated placenta prints.
CONNIE

Now you’re probably wondering, “How
big should the paper be? And how
Many good transfers can you get
before the placenta becomes too
dry?”..

Verona sighs loudly, leans her head on Burt’s shoulder, and
closes her eyes.
INT. HOTEL -- LATER THAT AFTERNOON

They're packing to leave for the airport. Burt finds
something in his suitcase -- the video camera.
89.

BURT
Damn. We’ve totally forgotten to be
documenting.

VERONA

You’re not serious.

BURT
Rone, you want no record of this
whole miraculous transformation?

VERONA
I want no cheap ugly grainy video
record of this miraculous
transformation.

Burt’s already got the camera out and is hooking it into the
tripod.

BURT
Let’s go. Get naked. And get up
against the window there, with the
light. It’1l look cool.

Verona not-so-reluctantly complies. Soon she’s undressed and
standing near the window, with a soft light falling on her
curves.

BURT
That’s nice. Nice. Now stand on the
chair.

VERONA
What?

BURT

Please? You want it to look
artistic, don’t you? Stand on the
chair. Like this.

(indicating one leg up,

like a flamingo)

Soon she’s in the desired position, and Burt gets the video
camera ready.

BURT
So glad I brought the tripod. It’s
gonna be good... Okay, ready?

VERONA
Ready.

Burt turns the camera on. His eyes go wide.
90.

BURT
Oh Jesus.

VERONA
What?

Through the viewfinder, we see that there’s a tape already in
the camera. The frame shows a very un-pregnant Verona, naked,
standing in much the same position as she is at the moment.
The contrast is interesting: in the video, the color is lurid
and cheap. Just beyond, in the hotel room, Verona is
illuminated softly, and looks ethereal.

VERONA
What is it?

Burt is watching, eyes popping.

VERONA
You didn’t bring the tape.

BURT
(in quiet awe)
It’s in the camera.

Verona comes down off the chair and around to Burt. Together
they slowly sit down on the edge of the bed.

VERONA
Oh god. I haven’t seen this since
we made it.

Burt and Verona sit attentively on the edge of the bed. The
tape begins. It’s a homemade sex video. The camera has been
left on a bookshelf by their bed, and has captured Burt and
Verona engaging in a relatively standard sex session.

We watch Verona and Burt as they watch the tape, and the look
that comes over their faces is one of utter melancholy. They
miss those days.

A song begins as Verona and Burt both begin to get teary.
That song is “The Way We Were.” We watch them watch
themselves humping, and the lyrics begin.

Memories

Like the pages of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were...
gl.

INT. AIRPLANE -- EN ROUTE TO MONTREAL
“The Way We Were” continues, wall-to-wall.

Verona is sitting on the plane, alone, peaceful. The seat
next to her -- Burt’s -- is unoccupied.

Suddenly he appears behind her. Screaming. Though we can’t
hear him, it’s clear he’s cursing loudly. Verona’s eyes open.
Everyone on the plane turns, aghast.

“The Way We Were” continues.

INT. MONTREAL HOUSE -- NIGHT

Verona and Burt are outside a beautiful walk-up in a clean
and charming neighborhood of the city.**

VERONA
We went to the same college as
these guys. We graduated the same
year. How can they be so grown up
while we're...

BURT
Immature? Stunted? Confused?
American?

They ring the doorbell. The chime is a novelty -- the sound
of a mild electric shock, and someone reacting to it:

DOORBELL
Zzzzt. Ahhh!
Burt plays with the doorbell for a minute -- Zzzzt! Aaaaaah!

Zzzzzzt! Aaaaaah! A 5-year-old Chinese girl answers the door.

VERONA
Hi. Are your parents home?

YOUNG GIRL
They're in their room.

BURT
Hey Abigail. Abby. Remember me?

She shakes her head. Burt is mildly hurt.

VERONA
Should we come in?
92.

ABBY
Yeah.

Abby leads them into the house and into the TV room, where
four kids are splayed out all over a system of couches. The
kids are JAMES, 16 and white; on his lap is STUART, a 6-year-
old South African boy. Nearby is KATYA, 10, an adoptee from
Kazakhstan wearing a huge rainbow afro wig. Together they’re
all watching The Sound of Music.

ABBY
It’s almost over.

Verona and Burt are encouraged to sit and watch.

The movie is at the point where the Von Trapp children
perform their “So long, farewell,” song. Just after the song -
- and before any Nazis appear, the movie abruptly ends, and
the credits roll. The lights come on and the kids begin to

sit and stand up.

BURT
Wait. What--

TOM
Shh.

TOM GARNETT, the father of the children, appears. He’s about
37, handsome, unaffected, dressed to go clubbing. He walks
through the room, touching all of the children’s heads in a
very comfortable and very affectionate way. He’s a big-
hearted, magnanimous guy. Each of the kids loves the
attention -- their bond with him is undeniable -- though
Stuart, who thinks he’s a dinosaur, tries to bite Tom’s hand.

Tom now motions Burt out of the room. Verona follows and the
three of them huddle in the kitchen. Tom gives hugs to both
Burt and Verona.

TOM
Great to see you guys!
(to Verona)

You look amazing, Verona. Perfect.

BURT
So, uh...

Burt gestures back to the TV room.

TOM
We sorta edited it.
93.

BURT
You cut out the Nazis.

TOM
Yeah. We kinda figured, What’s the
point, you know?

BURT
They haven’t caught on?

TOM
Not yet. Not even the oldest. Or
maybe he has, but he plays along.
You won’t tell them about the
Nazis?

BURT
No.

TOM

(genuinely relieved)
Thanks man. I appreciate that.
There are always people who want
the kids to know everything right
away -- sex! war! genocide! But we
think the longer we can keep them
from knowing about the Nazis, the
better. They heard something about
Pol Pot a few months ago and I was
doing spin control for a week. Hey
Munch!

MUNCH, Tom’s wife, walks down the stairs and greets everyone.
Munch is casual, confident, with a huge and convincing smile.
She's also preppy, almost conservative-seeming at first
glance.

They all go back into the family room.

TOM
Kids, this is Verona and Burt. Your
mom and I went to college with
them.

Munch is staring at Verona, with sudden tears in her eyes.

Abby, the 5-year-old, pulls up a kids’ chair so she can stare
at Verona’s stomach; Munch keeps a strange distance.

Meanwhile, Stuart, the 6-year-old, takes Burt’s hand and
leads him to a corner of the couch. He positions Burt to sit
as if he’s lounging on the couch, about to take a nap. Stuart
then climbs onto the arm of the couch.
94.

Burt sits on the couch.

STUART
Lie there.

BURT
Okay.

Stuart arranges Burt so he’s on the couch, resting against
one end, as if taking a nap.

STU
Close your eyes.

BURT
Okay.

Burt closes his eyes.

BURT
Gah!

Stuart has jumped from the arm of the couch, onto Burt’s
stomach, feet first.

BURT
(to Munch and Tom)
What the hell was that?

MUNCH
That’s Garfield. You’re John. The
cartoon. You’re napping, he leaps
on you. This is the game.

STUART
Do it again.

Burt complies. Again Stuart jumps on him, which hurts like a
mother. This continues as someone is tapping Verona on the

shoulder.

TOM
(seeing over Verona’s
shoulder)
You have a visitor. Someone
important.

Verona turns around. There is a tall person, very small-
faced, wearing a raincoat. It’s Abby, sitting on the
shoulders of her sister Katya.
95.

ABBY
(in very serious, KGB
voice)
Ma’am.
VERONA
Yes.
ABBY
I have a question for you.
VERONA
Yes.
ABBY

Do you know the way to San Jose?

TOM
Okay you guys. We have to go now.
Your mom and dad are going to tear
up the town. James’1ll watch you.

Burt is still on the couch, getting assaulted by Stuart.

BURT
(with eyes closed)
How many times does John get woken
up by Garfield?

Blank stares all around. It could take a while.

STUART
Close your eyes.

TOM
We'll get the car and meet you out
front. James, we'll be back late.
Lock up and give Katya her
medicine. And you have my cell.

JAMES
I do. Have fun.

Burt slips away from Stuart and meets Tom near the hall --
they're putting on their coats.

BURT
Who’s that? The tall one... You
would have been about 18...

TOM
James? He’s not mine. He’s a kid
who lives down the street.

(MORE )
96.

TOM (cont'd)

He worked on our crew over the
summer, good with wood, drywall,
and ...

(as if it just occurred to

him)
I guess he lives with us now. His
dad’s a meth addict. His mom’s a
bassist. Good kid. Wants to be an
architect.

EXT. GARRETT’S HOUSE

Verona and Burt are walking down the steps, on the way to the
street. Verona clutches Burt’s sleeve.

VERONA
(rapturously)
This is the family I want. Every
part of it. The kids from all over
the world--

BURT
So you want to adopt?

VERONA
Yes!

BURT
(pointing to her stomach)
What about this one? Should we
trade her in? I bet we could get
two Chinese girls, or three
Russians--

VERONA
No. I want her, and them, too. I
want to live in a big house like
this, with all the kids, and the
couches, and carpets, and have
everyone laying all over each other
like that. This is a family.

BURT
Yeah. It works. It’s real.

VERONA
We should move here. Montreal.
These guys’ll be our best friends
and our daughter will be friends
with all these kids. And she won’t
have any of the American baggage!
(MORE )
97.

VERONA (cont'd)
She won’t have to pretend to be
Canadian when she backpacks through
Europe... Think of that.

Tom and Munch screech to a halt beside them, driving a small,
older sports car. Munch is already drinking from a flask. Tom
is at the wheel and is wearing driving gloves.

TOM
Let’s do this.

INT. TOM’S CAR

Tom is driving very fast. Verona and Burt are in the back
seat. They’re passing the flask around. Music blares. They've
gone into high party mode with incredible speed.

VERONA
So you still find time to go out?

TOM
We’re out a lot, I guess. Depends
on when. You have to find that
balance. I mean, the kids want you
there, but not all the time. They
need air as much as you do.

BURT
I think we’re moving here.

TOM
To Montreal? We already won the
competition? Over Hartford? Over
Phoenix? Hell yeah!

MUNCH
That’s wonderful news.
TOM
Let’s toast. Does anyone know a

toast?
No one knows a toast.
MUNCH
Okay. So... Yay for Burt and Verona
moving here. Probably if they’re
not stupid.

They all cheer.
98.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

They're at a casual bar, eating dinner while a jazz combo
plays in the background. Tom and Burt are turned toward the
band. Munch and Verona are having a private talk.

MUNCH
So did it take you guys a long time
to get pregnant?

VERONA
I think it was the first shot.
Beginner's luck.

MUNCH
Oh. That’s wonderful.

It’s clear that Munch doesn’t really find that news so
wonderful.

MUNCH
Any problems so far?

VERONA
Not so far.
(now sensing that she
shouldn’t be smug about

this)
I've been crying a little more than
usual.
MUNCH
Me too.
VERONA
You're not pregnant, are you? You
look--
MUNCH

No, no. No.
A couple walks by and sees Munch’s drink on the table. They
assume Verona is drinking while pregnant, and give her a
withering look.

VERONA
I can’t stand it.

Tom leans in.
99.

TOM
We need to eat real food. I need
bacon.

MUNCH
(to Verona)
He needs bacon.

INT. INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES -- MIDNIGHT

The four of them are in a booth. Tom is feasting on a large
stack of pancakes, with an enormous side of bacon. The other
three are drinking tea. Burt has a piece of apple pie.

TOM
(his face full of pig fat)
Wait. So you're still not married?
Burt, when are you going to
propose?

BURT
Propose? All I do is propose.
(to Verona)
Verona, will you marry me?

Verona does a quick shake of her head, as if she’s saying no
to fresh pepper on her salad.

MUNCH
(to Verona)
Is this true? It’s you who’s behind
this?

VERONA
I can’t see the point.

MUNCH
There isn’t any, really. Not unless
you have parents who care one way
or the other, which you don’t.
Maybe there isn’t really a point.
Is there a point, Tom?

Tom shakes his head.

MUNCH
It’s a nice tradition, though.

BURT
Your wedding was nice.
100.

MUNCH
It was, wasn’t it?

Now Tom has finished his bacon and is ready to expound.

TOM
You know what you need to be happy?

Munch rolls her eyes.

TOM
You need this.

Tom is holding up the maple syrup.

TOM
Here’s you two guys.

He takes two sugar cubes from the bowl on the table.

TOM
Or wait.

He replaces one of the sugars with a brown one.

VERONA
Thanks, Tom.

TOM
Okay. So you have you two. And
let’s say here’s the baby.

He takes a smaller brown cube and adds it to the plate.

TOM
And here’s your house.

He uses toothpicks to enclose the three of them in a very
crude house, with a coaster for a roof.

TOM
But what is this? Is that home, is
that a family? No, no. Course not.
That's just the raw material -- the
people, the walls, the furniture,
your jobs, maybe a nanny or
grandmother. The basics. That’s not
a family, that’s not a home. The
thing that binds it all together is
this.

Now he holds up the maple syrup.
101.

BURT
Awesome.

He begins to pour it all over the sugar and toothpicks.

TOM
This is love.

BURT
I knew it.

TOM

This is your love, guys, your
patience, your consideration, your
better selves. Man, you just have
no idea how good you can be! But
you have to use all of it.

(the syrup is everywhere

now, inches of it)
It’s not like simple brick and
mortar, where you use a little
layer of mortar between the bricks.
With this, you have to use TONS of
it. For every brick, there’s a half-
ton of mortar.

VERONA
I thought we were doing syrup.

TOM
Mortar, syrup, whatever. It’s the
same. It’s the glue. It’s all those
good things you have in you -- the
love, the wisdom, the generosity,
the selflessness, the patience.
Patience at 3am, patience after
work, patience when you feel like
your life is passing you by and
you're waiting for your baby to
burp -- you have to amp that
patience aspect so much it’1l make
you sick.

Reaction shot from Burt, who is staring at the mess of syrup
and sugar and coasters.

TOM
And you have to be willing to make
the family out of whatever you
have. We’ve got a Chinese girl, a
South African AIDS baby, a Russian
orphan.

(MORE )
102.

TOM (cont'd)
We've got a teenager from down the
street who wanted some stability --
he likes to eat dinner at 7 every
night. So he cooks for us sometimes
-- anything to know that at 7,
he'll be at a table, with six other
faces, a plate of hot food in front
of him. But the point is largesse,
is breaking the piggy bank of your
own love. Man, you have to be so
much better than you ever thought!

MUNCH
And once a week Tom and I go out
and at least one of us comes home
wasted... And it works, I think.

BURT
And the kids never know.

TOM
Once in a while Munch gives me a
hickey and I wear a turtleneck the
next day. The kids are none the
wiser.

INT. STRIP CLUB -- LATER

Burt and Tom are at a table near the stage, both of them
drunk. There is a sign near the bar that reads AMATEUR NIGHT.

BURT
There are a lot of couples here.

TOM
It’s Montreal. World capital of
this kind of shit. Where’s Verona?

BURT
Bathroom. Where’s Munch?

Tom points to the stage, onto which Munch is crawling. Cyndi
Lauper’s “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” kicks in and Munch
begins dancing.

Burt watches, aghast and fascinated. Munch is at first
awkward, beginning a routine, but then grows more
comfortable. She knows what she’s doing, and has done it
before. She takes off her blouse, revealing a slinky tank-
top.
103.

BURT
Uh oh. She’s using the pole now.
Don’t you want to say something?

TOM
Nah. Let her go.

Munch continues to dance -- a desperate sort of dance, a
dance of loss and defiance. The song, when you really listen
to it, is a sad one, too.

Someone takes a beautiful girl
And hides her away
From the rest of the world...

Verona walks into the room at that moment. She sees Munch on
the stage and freezes. After a moment, her eyes and Munch’s
meet; volumes pass between them.

TOM
(to Burt)
She had another miscarriage.

BURT
When?

TOM
Thursday.

BURT
No. Just this Thursday-- ?

TOM
Yeah.

Beat.

TOM
Hell, Burt. We’ve had too many
miscarriages. They take so much out
of you. This is her fifth. I know
she loves all those kids like they
were her own blood, but...

They watch Munch. Verona hasn’t moved -- she’s still
standing, frozen. The song is, in this context, powerful,
searing, and Munch’s dance is one of great melancholy and raw
power. At this point, Verona turns to Burt, and they lock
eyes. Tom continues talking to Burt, oblivious.

TOM
I wonder if we’ve been selfish,
people like us.

(MORE )
104.

TOM (cont'd)
We wait until we’re thirty-five and
then we’re surprised that the
babies aren’t so easy to make
anymore...

All the while, Burt and Verona are staring at each other.
They know how lucky they are.

TOM
..-And every day another million
fourteen-year-olds get pregnant
without trying... I just wish I
could make it work for her. If I
could fix it all and just grow a
baby for her. It’s terrible feeling
this helpless, man. You just watch
these babies grow and then fade and
you don’t know if you’re supposed
to name them or bury them or... I’m
sorry.

The song is ending and Munch is stepping down from the stage
to many cheers.

Tom helps Munch off the steps and she sits on his lap,
holding him fiercely.

From either side of the couple, Verona and Burt stare at each
other intensely, feeling very lucky.

INT. MONTREAL HOUSE -- NEXT MORNING

Verona wakes up, hearing what seems to be a muffled
conversation. She looks over and sees that Burt’s not there.
She looks around; the voice she hears is close, and is
Burt’s, but he’s not visible. She looks in the bathroom: no
Burt. She opens the door to the bedroom: no Burt in the
hallway. In fact, whenever she ventures from the bed, the
voice grows fainter.

Eventually she squats down, realizing that Burt is -- could
he really be? -- under the bed. She finds him there. He’s on
the phone. Finally he sees her.

BURT
(to the phone)
Hold on a sec. Rone’s up.
(to Verona)
It’s Courtney.
(back into the phone)
No. I’m telling her now.

BURT (cont'd)
(back to Verona)
We're going to Miami.

CUT TO:
Verona and Burt are getting dressed in a hurry.

VERONA
Why didn’t he tell you sooner?

BURT
He’s embarrassed. He’s my brother.

VERONA
I don’t get it. Grace would have
told me right away.

BURT
This is different. It’s
embarrassing if your wife leaves
you. She just left, Verona. They
never fought, nothing. That’s a
sign that there’s some other guy,
or she was just bored or whatever.
It’s hard enough that he’s a
dentist. He’s already sensitive
about that kind of thing.

VERONA
About being left.

BURT
About being boring. Helena was--
It’s not fair to say now, but she
was always a reach for him. She was-
- he knew I wasn’t that crazy about
her. I felt like she always had one
eye open for something better.

VERONA
Poor Courtney. How old is
Annabelle?

BURT
Eight.

VERONA
Jesus.

BURT
I know, I know.

They walk downstairs. The entire family is eating waffles.
Tom and Munch are wearing turtlenecks.
106.

ABBY
You guys want blueberry or
chocolate?

CUT TO:

INT. PLANE

This time, the plane ride is more melancholy. They have a lot
on their minds. Verona sleeps across Burt’s lap. All around
them are soldiers -- National Guard of all ages -- on their
way to or from Iraq or elsewhere.

INT. TAXI -- DAYTIME -- MIAMI

Burt and Verona ride, still preoccupied by the news of
Courtney's wife’s departure. The stunning scenery has no
effect on them.

EXT. COURTNEY'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

They arrive at Burt’s brother’s office. It’s in a small house
just outside of Miami’s downtown. The skyline is visible in
the background. It’s a cozy dentist’s office with signs out
front that welcome kids.

INT. BROTHER'S DENTAL OFFICE

It’s cozy inside too, though the waiting room is decorated
with posters and memorabilia celebrating the supremacy of the
70s art-rock band YES.

Sitting at the appointment window is not an adult secretary
but a girl of eight. She has a pencil behind her ear. This is
ANNABELLE.

She hears the bells when the door opens, but doesn’t look up.

ANNABELLE
Are you Mrs. Alvarez?
VERONA
No. Are you ... eight?

Annabelle looks up and brightens when she sees Verona. Burt
emerges from behind Verona and Annabelle’s face explodes into
a phosphorescent smile.
107.

ANNABELLE
Burp!

BURT
Hey Bellbottom! Come here.

Burt’s niece is cute in an awkward sort of way, with dark
rings around her eyes. Seeing Burt has her face contorted
into a wild sort of grin.

She can’t wait -- she crawls through the window and jumps off
the edge and into Burt’s arms. Burt lifts her over his head
and then hugs her for a long moment.

BURT
(whispering into her hair)
Hi sweetie-pie poop-a-loop. I
missed you so much.

Annabelle is too deep in a bliss-high to speak. She rests her
chin on Burt’s neck and chews her gum silently, her tiny
finger playing in Burt’s hair.

The moment is broken by a loud yelp from inside.

PATIENT
Holy mother of god!

In a few seconds, COURTNEY, about 37, with shaggy hair and
glasses, emerges. There’s blood on his uniform.

COURTNEY
(wiping his hands)
Hey! I thought you weren’t coming
till tonight.

BURT
We got an early flight.

COURTNEY
Verona! You look fantastic.

He gives her a warm hug. While they embrace, he sees Burt and
almost instantly tears up.

COURTNEY
Hey brother.

BURT
Hey brother.

BURT
Can you leave now?
108.

COURTNEY
Yeah. Maria?

Maria, a young dental assistant, walks in.

MARIA
Yes?
COURTNEY
Can you finish Mr. Hyland?
MARIA
I don’t--
COURTNEY

Do your best.

EXT--MIAMI STREET--DAY

They leave the office and walk out to the street. Courtney
looks up at the sun as if he hasn’t seen it in weeks.

COURTNEY
I'll drive. You hungry? I’m here.

They arrive at his car. It’s a new Volvo.

BURT
Nice.

Courtney can’t find his keys.

COURTNEY
I had em here.

He looks in his backpack. No luck. He checks and rechecks his
pockets.

COURTNEY
Belle, did I give em to you?

ANNABELLE
No.

Now he’s looking under the car.

BURT
You think they’re under the car?
COURTNEY
Shush! I have a spare down here.
(fumbling)

(MORE )
109.

COURTNEY (cont'd)
(from under the car)
GODDAMMIT.

He gets up, and slowly composes himself.

COURTNEY

(adopting a tone somewhere

between saccharine and

about-to-explode)
Bella, are you sure I didn’t give
them to you? Remember that
sometimes you’re wrong. You were
wrong yesterday when I asked if you
had already brought in the mail and
then we didn’t see that check that
Dad needed. Remember that?

Annabelle nods.

COURTNEY
So do you have them?

ANNABELLE
I'll go inside.

Courtney is vibrating. His frustration is far out of
proportion to the problem at hand.

BURT
C’mere, big brother.

Burt takes him aside and they huddle.

BURT
Hey. This isn’t you. I can’t let
you snap at Bella that way.

COURTNEY
I know, I know.

BURT
I don’t blame you, Cort. I mean,
this whole thing...

Burt sees Annabelle as she emerges from the office without
the keys. Seeing all four of them standing by the corner, a
cab slows, and Burt hails it.

BURT
Get in.

Courtney complies and they all pile in.
110.

EXT. WATERFRONT RESTAURANT -- EVENING -- LATER

They exit the restaurant and walk along the South Beach
promenade. Verona and Annabelle walk ahead, inexplicably
giving military salutes to everyone they pass. They pass a
parent with a five-year-old boy on a leash. Annabelle and
Verona exchange looks.

Burt and Courtney walk some distance behind.

BURT
Have you heard from her?

COURTNEY
Not a word.

They walk a few steps.

COURTNEY
Isn’t that strange? She was never
like that, really. She was kind of
normal, right?

BURT
She was pretty normal.

COURTNEY
You know how many times I’ve
checked our messages? I check them
ten times an hour. I got all the
lines to bounce to my cellphone.
Maybe she was kidnapped.

BURT

But you said she left a note.
COURTNEY

Yeah. But it might have been

coerced....
Beat. Courtney comes to his senses.

COURTNEY
I guess not. It’s so weird. I've
never felt so emasculated. I feel
like such a chump. And the rage!

BURT
(remembering the car-key
episode)
Yeah.
111.

COURTNEY
I have to invent new ways of
dealing with it every night. I
destroyed all the lawn furniture.

BURT
What’d you use?

COURTNEY
Nine iron.

BURT
(interested)
Not a wedge...

COURTNEY
I’m so confused, though. Part of me
is so angry I don’t want to ever
see her again. I mean, I have all
these daydreams of her in prison,
and getting painful tattoos all
over her body. And on the other
hand I just want her back and
things to be the same.

BURT
Belle seems okay.

COURTNEY
Yeah. That’s even weirder.

BURT
What’d you tell her?

COURTNEY
At first I said it was a business
trip. I made the mistake of telling
her it'd be five days. I actually
thought that was a conservative
estimate. I thought I’d have
figured it out by then. Then five
days went by and Belle wanted to
know where she was. So I said her
grandpa died.

Burt looks mildly shocked.
COURTNEY
It took her mind off of her mom for

a while.

They walk.
112.

COURTNEY
I really need help. With what to do
next. Sorry I called. I just... If

she’s really gone for good, I need
to know what to say. It’s wrong to
say Helena was murdered, right?

BURT
That might be traumatic.

COURTNEY
Yeah, but there’s finality there...

INT. COURTNEY'S HOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Courtney, Burt and Verona are all sitting on Annabelle’s bed,
acting out a story together.

COURTNEY
And then the bullfrog said...

Silence. All eyes are on Verona.

VERONA
Wait, was that me? I’m the
bullfrog, too?

The answer is yes. Verona looks at the page.

VERONA
(adopting the voice of a
bullfrog)
Where is my crown? I need my crown!

COURTNEY
And to that the wolverine said:

BURT
(in a German accent)
“You vill nevah have your crown,
stinky bullfrog! I have buried it
under zah giant acacia tree! Ha ha
ha ha ha!”

Burt’s wolverine voice and maniacal laugh are a bit over the
top.

COURTNEY
And so the story ends. At least
tonight it does. Say goodnight to
Uncle Burp and Verona.
113.

Burt and Verona each lean down and give hugs to Annabelle,
who seems desperately happy that they’re there.

Annabelle settles into bed and then looks at Verona.

ANNABELLE
Your boobs are soft.

VERONA
Thanks.

ANNABELLE

My mom’s are harder.
VERONA
Okay.
EXT. COURTNEY’S PORCH -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Burt and Courtney and Verona are on the porch. Verona is
asleep on an Adirondack chair.

Courtney pulls something from his wallet.

COURTNEY
You see this?

It’s Annabelle’s new school picture.
BURT

(examining it)
That’s cute. What’s on her upper

lip?

COURTNEY
Carrot juice.

BURT
Huh.

COURTNEY

She just took this on Monday.
Remember when we had to wait weeks
for the school pictures? Anyway...
So this is the picture. I don’t see
the carrot juice on her mouth when
she leaves the house. I’m never
going to see these things. Moms see
the carrot juice on their
daughters’ mouths. Moms know when
their daughters aren’t dressed
right.

(MORE )
114.

COURTNEY (cont'd)

Moms go shopping with them, and
make sure their hair doesn’t look
spazzy. In one fell swoop Helena
has changed this girl’s life from a
normal one, where she can be
popular and all that, to the
distinct likelihood that she’s
going to be introverted, a poor
dresser -- one of those girls who
looks longingly at the girls who
have new shoes and the right
backpack...

VERONA
(suddenly awake)
At least it was carrot juice. Not
whisky.

COURTNEY
It’s just the beginning, though.
Things devolve from here. I’1l be
spending every waking moment trying
to reconstruct a normal life, but
everyone around will have more
tools, more money, more ability to
form a regular family. And
Annabelle will always be the girl
without a mom.

INT. COURTNEY'S HOUSE, GUEST BEDROOM -- MUCH LATER

Verona wakes up, notices Burt’s not there. She hears his
muffled voice, looks out the window and sees him on the back
patio, with a phonebook open, pacing while talking on his

cellphone.

She comes downstairs and joins him.

VERONA
What are you doing?

BURT
I’m looking for her. I’m calling
anyone she knew. Her old company,
her friends --

VERONA
At 2 in the morning.

BURT
Right. Element of surprise.
115.

Verona notices the broken patio furniture -- victims of
Courtney's frustration.

VERONA
Stop, please.

Burt sits down. Then stands up. He’s so agitated he can’t
stay still. Finally he gets onto Annabelle’s trampoline -- a
big rectangular one, 3 feet off the ground.

BURT
(now jumping)
What kind of goddamned person would
leave her daughter?

VERONA
(watching him go up and
down )
I don’t know. Maybe not such a
strong person. Please stop.

BURT
(not stopping)
And there’s nothing we can do.
She's gone. This family can’t be
fixed. That’s it. What if one of us
freaks out like that?

VERONA
We won't. And it can be fixed and
you know it. And if you don’t stop
jumping I will find a way to hurt
you with that shovel.

She points to a large iron shovel. Burt stops jumping.

BURT
C'mere. Sit down.

He pulls her onto the trampoline. Soon they’re both on their
knees, facing each other.

BURT
But really -- what if something
happens to one of us and makes us
crazy? Like what if I walk by a
construction site and something
falls and my frontal lobe gets
chopped off and my personality is
altered and then I’m not a good
dad. What if that happens?

Verona doesn’t know how much she should humor him.
116.

VERONA
We'll be careful walking near
construction sites.

BURT
And what about Munch?

VERONA
She'll be careful near construction
sites, too.

BURT
No really. Don’t you just look at
her and want to give her everything
she wants? It’s insanely unfair
that she can’t--

VERONA
Of course it’s unfair. She can’t
conceive, and bad parents still get
to be parents, and good parents die
when their daughters are in high
school. So what.

BURT
I’m sorry, Rone.

VERONA
All we can do is be good for this
one baby. We don’t have control
over much else.

BURT
Let’s get married at least.

VERONA
Never.

Burt's visibly disappointed. He really thought she’d say yes
this time.

VERONA
But I’1l never leave you.
BURT
(dejected)
Yeah.
VERONA

I promise.
117.

BURT

Okay.

(pause)
You promise to never marry me
because you don’t want to marry me
without your parents there -- and I
get that -- and you promise to
never leave me. But do you promise
to never leave this baby we're
having? Unless maybe part of your
brain gets knocked off by an I-
beam?

VERONA
I do. And do you promise to stop
talking about your ability to find
or not find my vagina after I give

birth?
BURT
I do. And do you promise to let me
cobble--
VERONA
Carve.
BURT

To carve in my spare time and teach
our daughter the lure of the great
Mississippi?

VERONA
I do. And do you promise to never
try to make art out of my placenta
or any other bodily discharge?

CUT TO:

EXT. TRAMPOLINE -- CONTINUOUS -- LATER

They're lying down now, face to face. Burt has found a
tarpaulin and pulled it over themselves.

BURT
I do. And do you promise to let our
daughter be fat or skinny or any
weight at all because we want her
to be happy no matter what and
eating disorders are too stupid and
cliche for our daughter?
118.

VERONA
I do. And do you promise to raise
this kid without fear -- without
child-leashes and fences and
without buying into the insane and
almost totally unfounded child-
abduction paranoia crippling our
nation?

BURT
I do. And do you promise, if I get
one of those parasites that creeps
up your nose after you go swimming
in certain shallow lakes and then
slowly eats your brain and you die
within a week, that you’ll lie and
tell our daughter that her father
was killed by Russian soldiers in
intense hand-to-hand combat so he
could save 850 Chechnyan orphans?

They're both fading now. Verona’s eyes are closed.

VERONA
Yes, Chechnyan orphans... I do...
And do you promise that sometime
tonight we'll figure out where the
hell we’re going to live with this
baby, coming very soon into this
world?

BURT
I do.

EXT. COURTNEY'S BACK PATIO -- MORNING

Burt and Verona are entwined on the trampoline. They’ve
fallen asleep there, after talking half the night.

Annabelle comes outside, crawls onto the trampoline and
kneels next to them. She pokes Verona’s breast.

ANNABELLE
They really are softer.

Burt and Verona wake up.

ANNABELLE
You're supposed to come inside like
normal people and eat food that
normal people eat, inside like
normal people.
119.

She goes inside. Burt and Verona follow slowly. They catch
themselves, remembering what they decided the night before.

VERONA
I had a dream we made a really
strange decision.

BURT
I think it’s the right one, though.
Don’t you think?

VERONA
I honestly have no idea. All I know
is that I can barely breathe just
thinking about it.

ANNABELLE
(at the door, waiting)
Are you normal people or not?

INT. COURTNEY'S HOUSE -- MORNING

They're all eating breakfast. We catch them mid-conversation.
Burt and Verona have figured out where they’re going next --

where they’re probably going to live -- and have just told
Courtney.
BURT
You're welcome to come. There’s
room.
COURTNEY

It sounds good. I think it’s the
right thing for you guys. But no, I
better stay here for now.
Annabelle’s in the school play.
She’s the lead.

VERONA
(to Annabelle)
Really? What’s the play?

ANNABELLE
(with a mouth full of
oatmeal, using her spoon
to make a stabbing
motion)
Medea.

COURTNEY
But maybe someday. I don’t know. Is
Grace coming?
120.

VERONA
Ew. You can’t go after Grace now. I
know you always lusted after her
but that would be too weird.

COURTNEY
Hey -- I was just asking. Idle
curiosity.

Burt winks at him; they share a lascivious sort of look, both
thinking of Grace.

INT. BURT AND VERONA’S CAR -- DAYTIME -- ROLLING HILLS

It’s late Spring. Verona is a month or so more pregnant. Burt

and Verona are driving through an unfamiliar landscape.
Hilly, semi-rural, beautiful, maybe a bit run-down.

BURT
Is it starting to look familiar?
VERONA
(uncertain)
I think so... I want it to... But I

also want it to be new, you know?
New for us? New enough to feel like
we found it? Does that make sense?

BURT
It does.

VERONA
(seeing something)
Oh god, I remember that!

They both look at a tree in front of someone’s yard,
decorated with a dozen kinds of fruit -- apples, oranges,
bananas, pineapples. The owner has strung fake fruit from the
branches.

VERONA

I have to call Grace.

(she dials)
Yup, we’‘re almost there.

(pause)
No, I’m fine.

(pause)
It is! That’s why I called. We just
passed it. Pineapples! Yes. No, I
didn’t see the cantaloupe...

(to Burt)
Wait, that was it.

I’1ll call you after we get there.
Love you.

She hangs up. Sighs. Burt backs up.

BURT
You ready?

VERONA
I am. Are you?

BURT
I am.

They head down a narrow winding road canopied by wisteria and
kudzu. Burt is clearly in heaven; it’s the landscape of his
dreams.

EXT. BEAUTIFUL SEMI-RURAL CULDESAC

They pull up to a Victorian house, three-storied and grand,
though in disrepair.

VERONA
Oh! I forgot how beautiful it is.

We realize this is Verona’s childhood home, the same house we
saw in the photo in Grace and Verona’s offices. It’s
dilapidated but full of character and potential.

They park and get out of the car.

There’s a creek running through the property; a bridge over
it connects the driveway to the front door. Burt is
astounded, taking it all in.

BURT
I love your parents so much right
now. They were geniuses. This is
what I want for our baby.

Tears burst from Verona.

As they walk toward the front door, Verona leans on Burt for
strength. She hasn’t been back home in 10 years.

At the doorway, Burt opens it and Verona has to steady
herself on the frame. She slowly slides down until she’s
sitting, overwhelmed.

Burt sits with Verona, looking around the house, inside and
out.

BURT
This is really us, don’t you think?

VERONA
I think it is. I fucking hope so.

We pull back until we’re outside the door. The door closes.

THE END.
