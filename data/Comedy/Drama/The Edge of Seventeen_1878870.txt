BESTIES

EXT. NORFOLK POND - SUNSET

A murky green pond dotted with floating litter.

NADINE ROSTAMI (16) skinny, self-conscious posture, a face
that hasn't quite grown into her nose, stands on the pond's
BRIDGE staring into the muck. She clutches a LARGE DUFFLE BAG
and talks into her CELL PHONE.

NADINE
I just called to tell you I'm
chucking everything you ever gave
me into the Norfolk pond. Yes, that
disgusting scummy festering
cesspool they haven't drained in a
hundred years and that has like 8
Cheeto bags and a dead squirrel
floating in it right this very
moment. Every birthday present, all
our pictures, that Canada
sweatshirt you got me from Canada
that's my favorite because the
inside is still fuzzy after a
billion washes... yeah, even that.
That's how dead serious I am. I
just have one last thing to say to
you so listen closely because I'm
not going to repeat myself: I nev--

VOICEMAIL LADY (V.O.)
Thank you. Your message has been
sent.

NADINE
Motherfucker.

Nadine's not sure what to do. This really blows. After a
beat, she dials again.

BEEP.

KRISTA (V.O.)
It's Krista, leave a message and
try to keep it short because I
think I have ADD. No, I'm serious.

NADINE
Your stupid voicemail lady cut me
off and it wasn't very good
fricking timing.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Anyway, as I was saying: I'm never
talking to you again. This
friendship... is officially over.

She hangs up and unzips the bag, ready to dump its contents,
when we:

FADE IN:
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND/RECESS - DAY

NADINE (V.O.)

Krista and I had been best friends
since the day we met back in the
Spring of 2nd grade.

Crouched under the PLASTIC SLIDE, we find LITTLE NADINE (6),
heavy brows and the faintest hint of a mustache even at this
age, and LITTLE KRISTA (6), blonde, chubby, glasses an inch

thick, playing Barbies together. Nadine has KEN's pants off

and is making him hump Krista's SKIPPER doll.

KRISTA
My name's Krista, what's yours?

NADINE
Nadine Hamidi Yousefa Rostami.

KRISTA
(impressed)
Wow, that's abuncha words. You're
real good at the Ken, too.

NADINE
You think so?

Krista smiles. Nadine beams, making Ken hump even faster.
Then, an idea:

NADINE (CONT'D)
Hey, you wanna be best friends?

KRISTA
(shrugs)
Sounds good to me I guess.

NADINE (V.O.)
And that was it.

CUT TO:
B.F.F.S MONTAGE ---
EXT. NADINE'S SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
NADINE (V.O.)

From that day forward, we were

inseparable.
Covered in head-to-toe protective pads, Nadine and Krista
nervously roller-skate down the sidewalk, holding each
other's hands for support, both horribly uncoordinated.

Nadine's older brother, DARIAN (8), bikes by with his
friends.

LITTLE DARIAN
(startling them)
Lesbos!!!
They lose their balance and eat it.

EXT. SUBURBAN HOME DOORSTEP - HALLOWEEN NIGHT

NADINE (V.O.)
We started doing everything alike.

Dressed in matching SHREK COSTUMES, they rush up to a
doorstep, sticking out their plastic pumpkins for candy.

SUBURBAN MOM
Aww, you boys make such adorable
ogres.
INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

NADINE (V.O.)
We learned new things together.

Now 9-years-old, Nadine and Krista are frozen in front of the
television, their eyes as big as baseballs.

Turn to reveal: They found the CINEMAX channel.
Darian suddenly pops up from behind the couch.
LITTLE DARIAN
You big fat perverted molesters!
I'm telling mom!

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DAY

NADINE (V.O.)
And kept nothing secret.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

Now 12-years-old, a taller, lankier Nadine gets up off the
toilet, looks down into the bowl and SCREAMS.

She rips open the stall door and frantically calls Krista
inside, their faces awash with amazement and disgust.

INT. SAV-ON CHECK OUT LINE - LATER THAT DAY

A lone box of ULTRA ABSORBENT MAXI-PADS goes by on the
conveyer belt. Nadine and Krista hide their faces in
magazines as the MALE CASHIER rings them up.

NADINE
As we grew up, theoretically, we
should've grown apart.

INT. OPTOMETRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Now 14, Krista trades in her glasses for CONTACT LENSES. She
smiles for Nadine, showing off the 'new her.'

KRISTA
(blinking uncontrollably)
Whaddaya think?

NADINE
(sincerely impressed)
Wooocooowwwwww.

INT. ESTHETICIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

An ASIAN WOMAN rips a cloth strip off 14-year-old Nadine's
upper lip, taking her mustache with it.

NADINE
(to Krista)
Do I still look like him, or is it
better now?

She holds up a PHOTO of PEDRO FROM NAPOLEON DYNAMITE for
comparison. Even without the mustache, the resemblance is
uncanny.

KRISTA
You don't look like a small Mexican
boy at all anymore. We're so ready
for high school.

INT. SUNNY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL DANCE - NIGHT
Nadine and Krista are all dolled up... and sitting alone on

the bleachers, guy after guy walking right past them without
so much as a glance.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

NADINE (V.O.)
But as it turned out, growing up
just made us closer.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Fuck these people.

Krista nods in agreement. They head for the door.

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
That is, until it didn't...

RECORD SCREECHES TO A HALT and we END MONTAGE.
EXT. SUNNY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL QUAD - LUNCH TIME

Everyone is sectioned off into cliques: Mean Girls eyeing
their manicures and complaining about the heat. Jocks with
their pecks flexed. The Dorks. The Drama Kids. The one
pregnant chick and her boyfriend who knows his life is over,
aaaaaaaaaand-—

Nadine and Krista, now 16, still just the two of them. Nadine
has grown out her Pedro haircut and shaped her brows
(shooting for Kim Kardashian but landing somewhere around
Mayim Bialik). It's an awkward, grows-on-you kind of
cuteness. Krista is blonde, pretty in a tomboy sort of way,
wearing a Radiohead t-shirt. They're sitting under a tree
with a penis carved into it.

KRISTA
We have to relocate. The penistree
smells like barf.

NADINE
(eating an enormous burrito)
I love the penistree, it's been our
spot since freshman year.

KRISTA
Ehh. I feel like we need a change.

NADINE (V.O.)
That should've been my first clue:
Change. But I was too busy scouring
the quad for--

Nadine suddenly stops eating her burrito.
NADINE (CONT'D)

(dreamily)
Hot Soccer Dan...

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED: (2)

He's walking out of the cafeteria -- handsome, tan, and
wearing a bright red and green RONALDO JERSEY. Time stops and
the music swells as he runs his fingers through his hair.

Nadine gazes at him longingly, mesmerized. All of the sudden
her burrito SMASHES INTO HER FACE, beans and rice everywhere.

NADINE (CONT'D)
What the hell, idiot?!

Nadine's brother, Darian, cracks up. He's now 18, buff,
gorgeous, and insanely popular. He and his buddy FUTCH (17)
linebacker's build, carry JACK IN BOX bags.

DARIAN
Oh sorry, did I bump you? Tell mom
I'll be home late, Futch is having
a party.

NADINE
(wiping burrito off her
cheek)
Screw you, tell her your gay self!

DARIAN
You should try smiling more, it's
good for you.

NADINE
You should try.... not sucking
more! And not being so dumb and
retarded...more.

Darian frowns at her pitiful comeback. Feels bad for her.

DARIAN
I love you, Nadine.

Nadine rolls her eyes, watches as Darian walks over to the
FLAGPOLE where the popular people hang out. Every single
person stops what they're doing to greet Darian The King. He
owns this school.

CARLY CORVETTI (17), vampire-gorgeous with a hint of crazy,
makes tragic bedroom eyes at him. He hardly notices.

THREE SOPHOMORE GIRLS approach Nadine.
SOPHOMORE GIRL #1
Excuse me, is that true? You're

Darian Rostami's little sister?

She gets it. They think she's cool just by association.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED: (3)

NADINE
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I am.

SOPHOMORE GIRL #1

Wow! You guys are so different,
it's almost like--

(turns to her friends)
What's that old movie where it
turns out Arnold Schwarzenegger is
twins with that short fat bald guy?

(friends have no idea)
You know! It's on TBS a lot, it's
from the 80's? And Arnold's like
big and buff and good-looking and
cool? And then his twin is just
like the leftover waste of genetic
shit?

(they still have no idea)
Come on, I know you guys know this!

NADINE
Twins. The fucking movie is called
Twins.

SOPHOMORE GIRL #1
Twins! Exactly, exactly!
(realizes)
I mean, but no offense...
Nadine's smidgen of confidence has already been squashed.
EXT. "GOLF N STUFF" MINIGOLF & FAMILY FUN PARK - THAT NIGHT
Nadine and Krista play a round of minigolf.
NADINE

I hate every single person we go to
school with.

KRISTA
I'm telling you, those girls are
morons.

NADINE

And my stupid brother. I just want
to kick his annoying face off.

KRISTA
Hmmm.

NADINE
What?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

KRISTA
No, I was just wondering if that's
possible. Kicking someone's face
off.

NADINE
Oh yeah. Sure. Let's say I'm like a
small Asian Karate master and I
just keep kicking his face and
kicking his face, bah! bah! bah!,
and then finally after like 45
minutes, his face is all bloody and
mutilated and dangling off the bone
like roast beef and shit. Uh huh,
absolutely possible. 100%.

KRISTA
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll buy that.

NADINE
Anyway, whatever, let's not talk
about him. Hey, so I had an idea
for us for prom.

KRISTA
Yeah?

NADINE
Get this. Hot dog suits. Matching
ones. It'll be awesome, ‘cause
it'll be like, "Hey fuckers, You
know how much we give a shit about
prom? We're dressed like pork
wieners, that's how much." You know
what I'm saying?

KRISTA
That's awesome, I love it.

NADINE
Me too, me too. Is it kinda
pathetic, though? I don't wanna
look pathetic, ya know?

KRISTA
No, no. It's badass. We're totally
doing it.
Nadine grins.
ERWIN (0.S.)

Nadine, is that you?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED: (2)

Nadine spins around to find ERWIN KIM (16), Korean, stoop-

shouldered, velcro sandals with socks.

NADINE
Oh, hey....(searching)...Korean guy
from my Chem Class.

ERWIN
It's Erwin. Erwin Kim.

NADINE
Yep, yeah. What are you doing here?

ERWIN
Oh nothin', you know, just hanging
with my bros...
(butchers it)
Chillizzillin'...like a bowwss.

Just then, ERWIN'S PARENTS bark at him in Korean, gesturing
for him to rejoin their game. He pretends that didn't just

happen.

ERWIN (CONT'D)
Anyway, so, uh, you know that tree
you guys always sit under? I took
too much Tylenol Cold and
accidentally puked my lunch down
the trunk the other day. I was
aiming for the trash can, sorry.

Krista gives Nadine a "toldja" look.

KRISTA
We appreciate the honesty.

ERWIN
And, um, also...I really like your
sweatshirt, Nadine. It's nice.
She's wearing the CANADA SWEATSHIRT.

NADINE
Oh. Thanks.

ERWIN
So's your hair and shoes and eyes
and teeth and socks.

NADINE
Wow. Okay. Thanks.

Erwin turns red, realizing that might have been

overkill.

(CONTINUED )
10.
CONTINUED: (3)

ERWIN
‘kay, I gotta get back to my
friends now.

INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Nadine and Krista and sprawled out on the couch.

KRISTA

Erwin Kim is your new lover.
NADINE

Shut up.
KRISTA

He totally imagines you undressing
him. Sloooooowly un-velcroing his
man-sandals.

NADINE
Whatever. That guy on youtube with
the hundred pound Elephantitis
balls is your new lover.

KRISTA
Aww, I feel sorry for that guy.

NADINE
I know, me too. Sometimes I drift
off in class and I'm just like,
",..that poor man and his poor big
balls, what's he doing right now?"

KRISTA
You know what, screw it, for twenty
million bucks, I would be his
lover. Okay, maybe not lover, but
I'd give him a real quick handjob
just to be nice and make his day.

NADINE
Wow, I had no idea you were such a
humanitarian, Krista.

KRISTA
I try to ask myself What Would
Jesus Do...

They both laugh.

(CONTINUED )
11.
CONTINUED:

NADINE (0.S.)

But if I'd been paying attention,

I'd have known that Krista feeling
uncharacteristically charitable in
the Handy Department was actually

clue number two.

Through the front door comes Nadine's mom, MONA (43), poofed
hair, wearing every piece of jewelry she owns. Her boyfriend,
JERRY (45) follows behind, a muscled-out gym rat in a too-
tight Hawaiian shirt.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Hey, how was The Olive Garden?

MONA
Great. I ate 400 breadsticks and
Jerry shared some really exciting
news.

NADINE
(not interested)
That's nice.

JERRY
Well I didn't want to make a huge
deal of it, but... I was offered a

pretty sweet job today.

NADINE

(perks up)

Oh really? Like what kind of job?

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
As long it was in any other field.
ANY. OTHER. FIELD.

FLASH TO:
EXT. SUNNY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL PICK-UP ZONE - DAY

Jerry rolls up in a THREE WHEELER METER MAID VEHICLE to pick
up Nadine from school, still in his weight-lifting gloves.

NADINE
(mortified)
I said I'd take the bus!

Jerry spots somebody doing something illegal.

JERRY
What's this dipshit doing? Hey
dipshit!

(MORE )

(CONTINUED )
12.
CONTINUED:
JERRY (CONT'D)
Do you not see the Loading Zone
sign, or are you just an asshole?

Nadine looks up to see he's yelling at a NICE LITTLE OLD LADY
wearing a sweater with dancing penguins on it, who works in
the front office. Hot Soccer Dan is observing all this, too.
She sinks into her seat, dying.

BACK TO:
INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
JERRY
Parking Enforcement offered me a

job at headquarters. No more work
on the route for this guy.

NADINE
No more work on the route?! Are you
serious?!

JERRY

Got my own office now and
everything. Big desk, new computer,
window.

(then)
Phone, printer, eraser board,
carpet, automatic hole punch,
stapler, pack of multi-color
Sharpies. Hole punch.

NADINE
Wow, sounds like you're really
runnin' shit, Jerry.

MONA
Anyway, we think this calls for a
mini-vacation. Drive up to Santa
Barbara for the weekend to
celebrate, whaddaya say?

NADINE
Can Krista come?

MONA
You'll have to talk to Darian.
Corolla only seats five and he'll
probably want to bring Futch.

(CONTINUED )
13.
CONTINUED:

NADINE
Oh screw Futch. How's that fair?
Darian's out getting wasted with a
bunch of dumb sluts, I'm here
drinking Diet Sprite with my
parents. I'm the good child, I
should be rewarded.

JERRY
How about I flip a coin. Heads,
Krista. Tales, Futch.

NADINE
No. No way. That's totally un--

JERRY
(already flipped it)
Heads. Krista wins.

NADINE
Ha! Yes! Darian can suck it!
(mimes him sucking it)
He can suck it, suck it, suuuck it.
Aww yeah. And then slap it. Slap
it. Really slap it.
(mimes slapping it)

JERRY
Slap it? Why slap it?

NADINE
(walks away)
I'm a winner.
INT. NADINE'S DRIVEWAY - NEXT MORNING
They pack up the car for the trip.
DARIAN
A coin toss doesn't count if I'm
not there for it.

NADINE
You lost. Sorry, loser.

Nadine heads inside for her bag, Krista gets in the car.
DARIAN

Mom, let's talk about this, I don't
thin--

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

14.

MONA
Oh give it up, Darian. You've been
cut enough breaks in life, let your
poor sister at least have this.

NADINE
Jeez, mom, you make me sound like
some kind of reject.

MONA
Sorry. I thought you went inside.

INT. JERRY'S TOYOTA COROLLA - LITTLE LATER

They're all piled in the car, on the way.

No.

KRISTA
What's the address up there,
anyway? I told my mom I'd text her.

NADINE
Oh, change of plans.

KRISTA
What? No more Santa Barbara?

JERRY
Well, I thought about it and I was
like, you know what, we could go
there anytime. Let's go somewhere
really special. Somewhere
incredible, somewhere we'1ll--

NADINE
(cuts to the chase)
Casino Morongo.

KRISTA
We're going to an Indian Casino?

JERRY
With a buffet that's going to knock
your socks off. You guys like
seafood?

KRISTA NADINE
No.

JERRY (CONT'D)
Then they've got a hell of a
swimming pool.
15.

EXT. CASINO MORONGO SWIMMING POOL - A LITTLE LATER
It's 112 degrees out and the pool is UNDER RENOVATION.

JERRY
Whoops, maybe shoulda called first.

MONA
Gallagher's performing, you guys
should go see him.

NADINE
Who's Gallagher?

JERRY
He's a comedian from the 80's. He
smashes fruit with a big hammer.

NADINE
And that's funny?

JERRY
Of course it is, fruit's goddamn
hilarious. Welp, we'll be at the
blackjack table.

MONA
Wear sunscreen and just because you
got your own room doesn't mean you
can charge crap to it.

They head off, leaving them. Darian starts laughing.

DARIAN
God I'm so bummed Futch isn't here
for this raging fun time.

NADINE
Oh shut up.

DARIAN
You know, I don't know how it's
possible, but even when I lose, I
still manage to win.

NADINE
You didn't win, Darian. You did not
win in any way, shape, or form.

KRISTA

He really kinda did, though, didn't
he?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

16.

NADINE
Krista. Jeez.

DARIAN
I don't know, I think God just
watches out for me, ya know? I'm
like his little buddy. I'm like
Jesus Christ with a cooler haircut.

Nadine just stares at him a beat. Then:

NADINE
This is officially it. Tonight is
the night I kill you in your sleep
and feel no remorse.

INT. CASINO MORONGO LOBBY - A LITTLE LATER

They linger outside the casino, coming up with a plan.

KRISTA
So how are we doing this again?

NADINE
We just calmly, slowly stroll past
security. Don't walk fast, it's
suspicious. Just a nice casual
stroll.

DARIAN
You guys are so dumb if you think
anyone'll buy you're 21.

NADINE
Hey, you're lucky we're even
letting you hang out with us, okay?

DARIAN
Oh yeah, I'm real lucky.

NADINE
You are. You'd have nothing to do.
You'd have to watch Gallagher,
that's how fucked you'd be!

KRISTA
So after we stroll in?

NADINE
Right, so once we're in ear shot of
the guards, you'll be all like,

(MORE )

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

17.

NADINE (CONT'D)
"Ahhh, income tax sucks so hard"
and I'm like, "you should see my
commute to the office." And then we
order Vodka Gimlets and bitch about
our husbands pissing on the seat.

KRISTA
We have husbands? Are they hot?

NADINE
They're both insanely hot model-
slash-Veterinarians. Come on, balls
to the wall, let's do this.

They go in for the kill. They almost make it to a slot
machine when a MAN IN A SUIT (40's) approaches.

MAN IN SUIT
Excuse me, ladies, can I--

NADINE
(immediately)
We're underage, I'm so sorry!!!

MAN IN SUIT
(trails off)
«--get...you a drink...

NADINE
Shit.
(then, why not)
Two Vodka Gimlets?

INT. CASINO MORONGO SEAFOOD BUFFET - A LITTLE LATER

The three

of them sit in a booth, Darian eats a crab.

DARIAN
Well, I'm amazed. I'm just
absolutely amazed that didn't work.

NADINE
You know what? I hope that crab
wakes up and punches you in the
face.

DARIAN

You hope it wakes up? It's dead,
not sleeping.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

A BUS BOY

18.

NADINE
I hope that crab miraculously comes
back to life and claws the fucking
shit out of your face and pokes out
your eyeballs and then takes a big
dump on your head.

DARIAN
That's pretty elaborate for a crab,
wow.

KRISTA

Maybe they have a deck of cards in
the gift shop. We could play Spoons
or something.

NADINE
We're not playing Spoons.

KRISTA
What's wrong with Spoons?

NADINE
It's stupid and it's not fun, and
we're gonna have fun even if it
freaking sucks!

enters from the back room dollying a case of JIM

BEAM towards the bar.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Hold on. I have an idea.

Nadine gets up, trying to formulate a plan. She's got it. She
jogs overs to the bus boy, frantically taps his shoulder.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Excuse me, sir, that lady is
choking! Please, quick, you've
gotta help her!

BUSBOY
Who? What lady?!
NADINE
The elderly woman with the oxygen

tank!

He turns to look, and the entire restaurant is elderly women
with oxygen tanks. As he runs off to find the victim, Nadine
quickly snakes a couple of bottles.
19.

INT. CASINO MORONGO HOTEL ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
Nadine does a dance, sloshing booze into their cups.

NADINE
Who is awesome?! Who is just one
big fat awesomesauce sandwich with
extra awesome dressing?

DARIAN
Okay, you did good, shut up.

KRISTA
(checks the mini-fridge)
We need a mixer, what's in here?

NADINE
Not me, I have gum.

DARIAN
Gum? Are you retarded? You can't
use gum as a mixer.

NADINE
Yes you can, you mix it with your
spit the old fashion way. I've seen
it done on TV like a thousand
times.

DARIAN
No you haven't, who's ever done
that even once?

NADINE
Like basically everyone who's not a
big gigantic pussy, okay!
(knocks back a shot, grimaces)
GOD THAT'S DELICIOUSLY MINTY!!!

KRISTA
Nadine, you better pace yourself.

NADINE
(pouring herself another)
Thanks, mom!
INT. CASINO MORONGO HOTEL BATHROOM - LATER

Nadine is curled up in the bathtub, hammered and suddenly in
a very dark place.

(CONTINUED )
20.
CONTINUED:

NADINE
You know what my problem is in
life? I've really been thinking
about this a lot... It's my head.

Krista leans against the opposite wall, only slightly less
inebriated.

KRISTA
What's going on in your head?

NADINE
No, no, my actual head. My skull.
It's too small. Before I thought my
nose was too big, but now I'm
thinking it's actually just that my
head's too small. It makes me look
ridiculous. I think that's why no
guy I like ever likes me, like Hot
Soccer Dan. And here's the really
fucked up part, okay? There's no
surgery for it. Even if I win the
lotto or become the first female
president, I'll still be stuck with
a weird little shrunken Beetlejuice
head for the rest of my life. And
then I think... why even go on?

KRISTA
You do this every time you drink,
Nadine. Get all depressed.

NADINE
No I do not! I do not! Yes I do. I
do, I'm a depressed person with a
big nose and a tennis ball head and
that's the truth. I'm gonna barf
right here down the bathtub drain.

KRISTA
Okay.

Nadine leans over and pukes.
NADINE
That was good. And you wanna know
the other thing, too?

KRISTA
What?

But when Krista looks over, Nadine's passed out cold. She
rolls up a towel, wedges it under Nadine's head as a pillow.
INT. CASINO MORONGO HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

21.

Darian lies on the bed, watching TV, pretty wasted. Krista

stumbles in, trying to keep her balance.

KRISTA

What are you doing?
DARIAN

I'm boning a Pygmy goat.
KRISTA

Um, okay.
DARIAN

Hey, you know that joke I told
earlier about the Pygmy goat and
how I was boning it, but I really
wasn't because I was watching
Antique Roadshow instead?

KRISTA
Yeah?

DARIAN
That was hilarious.

KRISTA
It was pretty good.

DARIAN
Come're.

She walks over and Darian fills up her cup, then his.

DARIAN (CONT'D)
Cheers. My sister passed out?

KRISTA
I think she had too much.

DARIAN
Do me a huge favor and take my
socks off for me?

KRISTA
Ew, no.

DARIAN
Please. I'd do it myself but
they're so far away from my hands.

(CONTINUED )
22.

CONTINUED:
KRISTA
I'm not touching your gross socks,
Darian.
DARIAN
I'll give you a million dollars.
KRISTA
You don't have a million dollars.
DARIAN
I'll rob a bank.
KRISTA
You'll go to jail.
DARIAN
Then I'1ll-- OH SHHHHIT!
KRISTA
What?
DARIAN

Oh, no way. I'm gonna kill her.

KRISTA
What?

He sits up and turns his head around to reveal: Nadine's GUM
is stuck in the back of his hair. Krista starts cracking up.

DARIAN
I knew I smelled peppermint! Aw
crap, it's all matted in there,
too.

KRISTA
You need peanut butter.

DARIAN
Where am I gonna get peanut butter?

KRISTA
You need ice. Hold on. Come here.

She stumbles over to the ICE BUCKET, brings it back and plops
down right next to him on the bed.

DARIAN

(re: her sudden close proximity)
Well, okay then.

(CONTINUED )
23.
CONTINUED: (2)

KRISTA
Oh stop it.

DARIAN
I'm not saying anything.

KRISTA
Shhh. Hold still.

She applies an ice cube to the gum.

DARIAN
Did it work?

KRISTA
It's been one second.

DARIAN
(one more second)
Did it work now?

KRISTA
I'm gonna kill you.

He smirks.

DARIAN
Wow, I've never seen you this up
close. It's like I flipped over to
Krista HD. Helloooooo, pores.

KRISTA
(feeling exposed)
Oh god, jeez.

DARIAN
No, it's interesting. You have a
major shitload of freckles, too.

KRISTA
Thanks a lot.

DARIAN

You're Irish, right?
(singing, high-pitch Irish accent)
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes
are callin’...
That song's Irish, isn't it?

(awful "big band" voice)
From glen to glen, and down the
mountain side.
That was with a Sinatra twist that
time.

(CONTINUED )

CONTINUED: (3)

KRISTA
It's amazing you're not in glee
club.

DARIAN

I thought about it, but then I was
like, you know, the hours, the
commitment, having to tell my mom
I'm gay...

Krista practically spits up her drink laughing. She takes
some of his hair with her.

DARIAN (CONT'D)
Ouch, Jesus, you just ripped out
half my scalp!

KRISTA
(still laughing)
Sorry sorry sorry!

He watches her laugh, liking this side of her.

DARIAN
Oh my god, and you totally laugh
like Fran Drescher.

KRISTA
(laughs more)
No I do not!

DARIAN
No, you really do though.

KRISTA
Hey, you better be nice to me, I
could leave this thing where it's
at.

DARIAN
You're right, I apologize, your
laughter is like harp music. How we
doing back there? Progress?

KRISTA
Open your hand.

Krista deposits the HAIRY PIECE OF GUM into it.

DARIAN
Wow, that is...that is... just
horribly disgusting.

DARIAN (CONT'D)
I'm going to keep it for the rest
of life.

KRISTA
Shut up.

DARIAN
In a jar, on my shelf, and every
time I look at it, I'll think of...
well, probably not you, actually.
I'll probably just be like, "Ew,
shit, that gum's still there?!"

She laughs again. He smiles. And then, before either of them
knows what's happening, he's kissing her. Krista pulls away,

shocked.

KRISTA
Whoa! What the fuck, what the fuck,
what the fuh-uh-uck?!

DARIAN
I don't know, I don't know, that
was weird, I don't know!

They just look at each other for a second, freaked out. Then
just as quickly they're all over each other again.

INT. JERRY'S TOYOTA COROLLA - NEXT DAY

The car ride back. It's eerily silent. Nadine stares at
Krista, puzzled.

NADINE
Something's weird.

KRISTA
Hmmm?

NADINE

Something's weird, I can't put my
finger on it, but something's off.
It's a vibe.

KRISTA
Maybe you're car sick.

NADINE
That's not it.

KRISTA

Did you eat something bad? Maybe
your bacon was tainted.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

26.

NADINE
My bacon was outstanding. My
bacon's never been anything short
of it.

KRISTA
I have no idea then.

Darian just stares straight ahead, not saying a word.

INT. SHHHS GIRL'S BATHROOM / HANDICAPPED STALL - MORNING

Nadine sits on the rim of the toilet, trying to digest this.

KRISTA
I am so, so, so, so, so sorry! I
don't know how it happened!

NADINE
Oh my god. Oh my god, I can't
breathe. It's like, I wanna puke
but I also wanna gouge my eyes out
and I don't know which to do first!

KRISTA
I should've told you earlier, I
feel terrible!

NADINE
How far are we talking about here?
No, don't tell me. Yes, tell me.

No, don't.
KRISTA

It wasn't that far, I promise.
NADINE

How far is not far? Second base?
KRISTA

Uhhhhhhh.
NADINE

Nooooo! You went all the way to
third base?

KRISTA
Oh god, I'm so sorry!
NADINE
A handjob?! You gave my brother a

handjob?!

(CONTINUED )
27.
CONTINUED:

KRISTA
It was a really quick one though!
Like the fastest I've ever rubbed
one out in my life, I'm serious!

NADINE
(covers her ears)
Oh god oh god oh god! La la la la!

KRISTA
I'll shut up, I'll just shut up!

Nadine gets a hold of herself.

NADINE
Okay... I'm okay...

(beat)
Wait a minute. Don't tell me you
actually like him?

KRISTA
What? Noooooooo. I was drunk. I was
out of my mind.

NADINE
Because he's a gigantic asshat,
Krista.
KRISTA
I know.
NADINE
Like, the gigantic-est.
KRISTA
I know.
NADINE

And he farts constantly. And he
sticks his finger in his
bellybutton and then sniffs it.

KRISTA
He does?

NADINE
Like. It's. His. Job.

Krista looks horrified.
KRISTA

I don't like him, okay? Trust me, I
don't like him one bit.
28.

INT. SHHS / DARIAN'S LOCKER - BETWEEN CLASSES
Darian's walking to class with Futch when Nadine corners him.

NADINE
Why don't you just go ahead and
grow yourself a little mustache,
huh Darian?

DARIAN
What are you talking about?

NADINE
Just grow a little mustache and
start hanging out in a park
bathroom with a bag of candy
because that's what you are: one
big Molestersaurus Rex.

DARIAN
Oh Christ, are you kidding me?

She turns to Futch.

NADINE
That's right, Futch, your best
friend took advantage of an
innocent girl and scarred her for
life.

FUTCH
Okay, I don't what you're saying,
but you sound like a dumbass.

DARIAN
Hey. I'm the only who calls my
sister a dumbass.

FUTCH
(immediately)
Totally kidding, Nadine.

NADINE
Whatever. Just know this, Darian.
Know this and never forget it:
(long dramatic pause)
You...are...gross.

She turns and walks off.

(CONTINUED )
29.
CONTINUED:

NADINE (CONT'D)
I really wanted to exit on a better
insult than that, but my hamster
brain wasn't giving me shit.
Tomorrow in the shower I'll come up
with like 50 zingers. I always do
my best thinking in the shower. For
instance this morning it occurred
to me that if my hair is bigger,
it'll create the illusion that my
head is actually bigger. Who knows,
Maybe even normal-sized.

Just then, somebody slams into Nadine from behind. Her
CHEMISTY BOOK goes flying.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Hey, watch where you're--

But it's HOT SOCCER DAN.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Uh --

(immediately fluffs up her hair)
Hi.

HOT SOCCER DAN
Sorry. I'm late to my class.

He picks the book up, hands it to her.

NADINE
Yeah, no, that's completely alright
and cool.

He keeps walking.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Oh, and um, my name's--

But he's about 40 feet down the hall now. She curses herself.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Daaaah! Quicker, you have to be
quicker!

ERWIN
What's wrong? You look all--
(makes a frazzled face)

NADINE

Nothing. Crap, I just remembered I
forgot to do my Chem homework.

(CONTINUED )
30.
CONTINUED: (2)

ERWIN
You can copy mine.

NADINE
Are you serious?

ERWIN
Yeah, why not?

NADINE
No, I just feel bad. I feel like
you shouldn't just let me do that,

Erwin.
ERWIN

Okay, then you can't then.
NADINE
(beat)

Maybe if I just copy like 90% and
guess on the rest? That's not
really cheating.

He hands it to her. She looks at it a sec, then:

NADINE (CONT'D)

Hey, listen. I feel like maybe I
should go ahead and clear something
up though. I get the sense you
might have a little, I don't know,
crush on me, so I just want to be
up front: I don't really see you
like that. Like at all.

ERWIN
Um. Okay. But you don't even know
me.

NADINE

That's true.

ERWIN
I mean, what if you get to know me
and you're all like, "oh wow,
Erwin's even funnier than Will
Ferrell in that one movie." Or
"Whoa, Erwin's brain's so big he
makes Einstein look like a dumb-
dumb." What then?

NADINE

Did you just use the word "dumb-
dumb"?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

ERWIN
No.

NADINE
Okay, fine. Are you funnier than
Will Ferrell? Do you make Einstein
look dumb?

ERWIN
No, but once I rode my bike really
fast with my eyes closed and I eat
a frigging serious lot of lactose
despite my intolerance.

NADINE
Uh huh. I'm probably gonna stick
with my original plan. Sorry. Do
you want this back then?

She holds up his homework.

EXT. SHHS

ERWIN
I guess not.

/ KRISTA'S LOCKER - A LITTLE LATER

Krista digs through her locker - it's wallpapered with AL
PACINO pictures. Al in The Godfather, Al in Scarface, Al
holding his Oscar. Darian approaches.

DARIAN
Why would you think it was a good
idea to tell my sister that?

KRISTA
She's my best friend, I tell her
everything.

DARIAN
And I love how you twisted it into
me taking advantage of you when you
know it was you who was all up in
my bidnass.

KRISTA
Oh yeah right, in your dreams!

DARIAN
You were! You were basically like,
Oh, Darian. Let me help you get
that gum out of your hair...

(CONTINUED )
32.
CONTINUED:
DARIAN (CONT'D)
(imitates her, licking his
lips and rubbing his
nipples)

KRISTA
I've never done that nipple move in
my life and you didn't even say one
word to me the whole next day!

DARIAN
Well I wanted to, but it was weird!

Krista exhales. They just stand there a beat.

DARIAN (CONT'D)
So you wanna grab a burger tonight?

KRISTA
Are you serious?

DARIAN
Maybe.

KRISTA
What kind of burger.

DARIAN
Cheese. No cheese.

KRISTA
Um... okay.

DARIAN
Come by around 7, I'll be back from

practice.
INT. NADINE'S BATHROOM - THAT EVENING
Nadine is spraying her hair into what basically amounts to a
beehive, but not that good. She's checking herself out from
every angle. Darian walks in, sweaty from football.

DARIAN
I need to get in the shower.

NADINE
Nope.

She keeps teasing her hair, eyeing herself.

DARIAN
‘kay.

(CONTINUED )
33.
CONTINUED:

He walks past her, picks up the TOILET BRUSH, rubs it around
in the toilet water and points the dripping bristles at her.

NADINE
(inching away from it)
Whoa whoa whoa!
He forces her right out the door, SLAMS it shut, locks it.
NADINE (CONT'D)
A bristle hit my thumb, you idiot!
I hope I die of e-coli just so you
feel guilty the rest of your life!
The DOORBELL RINGS.
INT. NADINE'S FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Nadine opens it to find Krista at the threshold.

NADINE

Hey, what are you doing here?
KRISTA

Uh, well--
NADINE

It's good, I need your help with my
hair. I know it looks like a rat's
nest, but is it in a cool, hip, Amy
Winehouse kind of way? Or more just
like "hi, the mental hospital
confiscated my hairbrush"? Be
honest.

KRISTA
I think maybe more the second one.

NADINE
Crap, I kinda thought so.

Krista steps inside. Nadine heads up the stairs.

NADINE (CONT'D)

Hey, so any word if your mom's
friend can sew the hotdog suits for
us?

KRISTA
Yeah, she's gonna make ‘em out of
polyfiber foam, that way they'll
bend and breathe but still maintain
their hotdoggy shape. Cool, right?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

34.

NADINE
Love it. Genius.
(realizes)

Why are you still standing there?
Come upstairs.

KRISTA
Uh... well, actually, I need to
tell you something, and I don't
know how you're going to take it.

Nadine freezes.

NADINE
Oh no, is Hot Soccer Dan in a coma?
Oh god.

KRISTA
No, no, he's fine. It's just
that... I didn't really come here
to hang out.

NADINE
Okay...

KRISTA
I came here to grab a burger.

(beat)
With your brother.

Nadine says nothing. Absolutely nothing.

KRISTA (CONT'D)
I know. I know. This is very weird.
And I know I said I didn't like
him. But then he asked me to get a
burger. And then I said yes. And
then... Well that's pretty much the
whole story actually.

NADINE
Like...like a date?

KRISTA
No, I don't think it's a date. I
think it's more just two people
casually enjoying ground beef on a
bun together.

NADINE

That sounds like every date I've
ever imagined being on.

(CONTINUED )
35.
CONTINUED: (2)

Darian comes down the stairs, all spruced up for the date.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Oh my god he has his good jeans on!

DARIAN
See you later, Nader.

As they head out the door, Krista turns back to Nadine.

KRISTA
Are you okay? Tell me you're okay
and you're not pissed.

Nadine just stands there. Wordless, awestruck.

DARIAN
Eh, she's fine.

He shuts the door.
EXT. SHHS HALLWAY - MORNING

Nadine eats breakfast as Krista tentatively approaches.

NADINE
Hey. How are you?

KRISTA
Fine. You?

NADINE
Good. Hashbrown square?

She takes one, eyeing Nadine.

KRISTA
You're being weird.

NADINE
No I'm not. I just offered you a
hashbrown square, how's that weird?

KRISTA
This isn't you. It's like a
Terminator-version of you and I'm
supposed to think it's you, but I
can tell it's really a computerized
look-a-like sent from the future to
offer me hashbrowns and eat my
brains.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

36.

NADINE
Eat your brains? When does the
Terminator eat anyone's brains?

KRISTA
Stop bullshitting me, Nadine.

NADINE
What do you want me to say? You get
drunk, you hook up with my brother,
then you go on a date and don't
even have the decency to call me
from the bathroom!

KRISTA
You wanted me to call you from the
bathroom, that's what you're mad
about?

NADINE
You always call me from the
bathroom on dates. Don't act like
this is new!

KRISTA
The circumstances were a little
different this time!

NADINE
So is he your boyfriend now? You
guys are like an item all the
sudden?

KRISTA
It was one date.

NADINE
So it was a date!

KRISTA
Oh my god, Nadine.

NADINE
I'm not comfortable with this. I'm
not comfortable with it at all.

KRISTA
So what do you want me to do then?

NADINE
I want you to never go out with him
again. He's my brother.

(MORE )

(CONTINUED )
37.

CONTINUED: (2)
NADINE (CONT'D)
He's off limits. I don't like it
and that's it!

Krista stands there a second, thinking this over. Finally:

KRISTA
Fine.
NADINE
(beat)
Seriously?
KRISTA
Yes. Seriously.
NADINE
Sweet.
(beat)

‘nother hashbrown square?
EXT. SHHS QUAD / PENIS TREE - LUNCH TIME

Nadine stands under the penis tree spraying a CAN OF
DISINFECTANT. Krista walks up.

NADINE
I think I've almost stamped out the
Erwin barf smell for good. This
stuff is industrial grade, they use
it on bum piss at the Third Street
Promenade.

KRISTA
I take it back.

NADINE
You take what back.

KRISTA
I'm not not-seeing your brother.
I've been thinking about this and
you really like peanut butter cups,
right? Well, I would never ask you
to stop eating them just because
they make me uncomfortable.

NADINE
What? That's the worst analogy I've
ever heard. First of all, my
brother isn't a scrumptious
chocolate snack, and second, how
can peanut butter cups make you
uncomfortable?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

38.

KRISTA
Lots of ways. Maybe I have a peanut
allergy. Maybe I just have
nightmares about them jumping down
my throat and clogging up my
arteries.

NADINE
That's crazy! They're not even that
fatty! Whatever, you know what,
fine. I would, I would never touch
another goddamn peanut butter cup
as long as I live just for you. In
fact, I'd have them all put ona
big boat and dumped in the middle
of the ocean because that's just
how much of a good freaking friend
I am!

KRISTA
That would do nothing! That would
just kill a whole bunch of sea
life!

NADINE
I'd kill that sea life in the name
of our friendship! I'd murder fish
to make you happy!

Krista rubs her temples, sighs.

KRISTA
He asked me to go lunch at Jack In
The Box and I want to go, and I
want you to come with us.

NADINE
Are you fucking kidding me?

KRISTA
No. I'm not.

NADINE
No way in hell, Krista! I'd rather
eat alone! I'd rather sit here all
alone under this tree, just me and
the penis and this can of
disinfectant!

KRISTA
Nadine--

(CONTINUED )
39.
CONTINUED: (2)

NADINE
No, you know what? Go ahead! Have a
blast with Darian at Jack In The
Box because apparently that's what
you want to do sooooo bad!

KRISTA
Are you seriously being this
dramatic?

NADINE
Go! See ya later! G'bye, Krista!

Krista hangs there a moment. Then:

KRISTA
Fine. I will.

She turns and leaves. Nadine watches her go, then sits a beat
under the tree. She looks up at the penis carving, then over
at the disinfectant. A group of SENIORS walk by, eyeing her
sitting there all alone.

NADINE
(blurts self-consciously)
I'm waiting for someone!
Another moment passes. We go to an ultra-wide shot of Nadine
as a tiny little dot, the only person eating by herself in
the whole entire school. She can't handle it.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Dahhh!!!

She immediately grabs her stuff, runs after Krista.
INT. DARIAN'S PICK-UP TRUCK - A LITTLE LATER

Krista and Darian are up front. Nadine is scrunched in the
cab, straddling his STINKY PILE OF FOOTBALL PADS.

KRISTA
You okay back there?

The wind is tearing through the windows, whipping Nadine's
hair all over the place and stirring up the B.0. stink.

NADINE
I'm wonderful.

DARIAN

How do those football pads smell?
Glad you tagged along, sis?

(CONTINUED )
40.
CONTINUED:

NADINE
(not giving him the satisfaction)
I don't smell anything whatsoever.

DARIAN
Mmm hmm.

INT. JACK IN THE BOX - A LITTLE LATER

Carly Corvetti gets up from a table of her TWO ALMOST-AS-HOT
FRIENDS, saunters over.

CARLY
Well, look who's here...

DARIAN
Can't keep me away from those curly
fries, Carly.

CARLY
Curly fries are my favorite. They
remind me of something I just had
completely waxed off.

Darian raises his eyebrows. Carly smiles at him.

CARLY (CONT'D)
We're just leaving, but you're
coming to my party next week,
right? And I don't think I've met
your new little friends...

Darian puts his arm around Krista, pulls her towards him.

DARIAN
This... would be Krista.

Carly grins at Krista, but her face says, "You're having
lunch with this chick?"

DARIAN (CONT'D)
And that would be her friend,
Nadine. Who also happens to be my
sister.

NADINE
(pops out from behind him)
Helloooooo Miss Lady.
(no response)
From Step Brothers? No?
(beat)
Congratulations on your pubes.
41.

INT. JACK IN THE BOX BOOTH - A LITTLE LATER
The three of them eat their lunch. No one's talking.

NADINE
So this is what you guys did last
night? Silently chewed your food
and stared at each other? It's a
real blast, lemme tell ya.

DARIAN
Did you ever think that maybe it's
awkward because you're sitting

here?
NADINE
I'm impeding your conversation
then?
DARIAN
Maybe.
NADINE

And what would you be talking about
that you couldn't say in front of
me?

Darian lifts his eyebrows, looks at Krista conspiratorially.

NADINE (CONT'D)

Ew. You talk about your balls or
something? Is that what you guys
do? "Blah blah blah, Darian's
balls, Darian's penis, half an hour
of Darian's balls and penis" and
then you call it an evening?

KRISTA
Pretty much word for word.

NADINE
Don't be sarcastic right now.

DARIAN
She's right. There's no reason we
shouldn't act exactly the same as
we did last night.
(acting the same)
Hey, Krista?

KRISTA
Yeah?

(CONTINUED )
42.
CONTINUED:

DARIAN
You've got some sauce on your chin.

He leans over and runs his tongue all the way up her face,
slowly licking it off. Krista lets out a loud laugh, punching
him in the arm. Nadine throws her chicken sandwich down,
disgusted.

NADINE
You. Sick. Motherfuckers.

KRISTA
He did that for show. That didn't
really happen.

Nadine stands up, done.

NADINE
I'm waiting in the car.

INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Nadine is slumped on the couch, watching her mom do Wii
Aerobics.

MONA
I think it's great. Maybe they'll
fall in love and get married and
Krista will be your sister like
you've always wanted.

NADINE
Mom. Do not even say that.
(looks heavenward)
You didn't hear that, Universe!

MONA
You should have fun with it, why
don't you start going out with one
of Darian's friends? What about
Futch?

NADINE
I'm not going out with Futch. He's
fat and he barely talks and no.

MONA

Don't be mean to fat people. Your
mother's fat.

(CONTINUED )
43.
CONTINUED:

NADINE
You're not fat. Does Jerry tell you
that? Is that why you're doing
aerobics? I'll kill him.

MONA
No, no, Jerry thinks I'm beautiful.
He tells me all the time.

Nadine pauses, thinking about that.

NADINE

See, that's the thing, isn't it.
MONA

What?
NADINE

You're not beautiful unless
somebody thinks you are.

Mona turns around, faces her daughter.

MONA
I think you're beautiful, Nadine.

Nadine just looks at her.
NADINE

That's the most terrible thing
you've ever said to me, mom.

MONA
Why?

NADINE
Because I -- nevermind.

Nadine gets up, leaves the room. Mona frowns.
INT. NADINE'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nadine steps into the bathroom, closes the door behind her,
takes a deep breath, then addresses herself.

NADINE
Nadine, just relax, okay? You're
getting all worked up and crazy.
This whole thing is going to pass.

NADINE (CONT'D)

In fact, I'll bet you a million
bucks it already fizzled out after
that bizarro lunch today, I mean
you saw them, they have nothing in
common. Pretty soon this is going
to be one of those things you look
back and laugh about, alright
little buddy? Yep, you called
yourself little buddy, you really
did, and that's completely fine
because no one heard it except you.

She exhales, feeling better.

NADINE (CONT'D)
You're gonna be okay.

On her way out, something on the bathroom counter catches her
eye: A BAG FROM RITE AID. She looks inside, curious.
MOUTHWASH, OLD SPICE DEODORANT, and AXE BODY SPRAY.

She freezes, realizing. The pep talk immediately goes out the
window, and she bursts out of the bathroom towards Darian.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
NADINE
What's all that stuff from Rite Aid
for?

She corners him as he's coming down the hall.

DARIAN
Move, you're in the way.

NADINE
Why do you want to smell so goddamn
fresh suddenly, huh?

DARIAN
Move or I'll do it for you.

His CELL PHONE RINGS. He picks it up.

DARIAN (CONT'D)
Oh hey, Krista, what's up.

Nadine's eyes pop open. He slides right past her into his
room.

NADINE

What?! That's her? She's calling
you?

(CONTINUED )
45.
CONTINUED:

She tries to stop him, but he's already closed his door and
locked her out.

NADINE (CONT'D)
No. Uh-uh. No way.

She pulls out her own PHONE and dials Krista.

KRISTA (0.S.)
Oh how funny, I just called your
bro, can I call you right back?

NADINE
No you can't, Krista. I really
don't know how to feel about this
whole you suddenly phoning Darian

thing.

KRISTA
Okay, I don't really see what the
big--

NADINE

The big deal is you can just call
me, and after we talk, if there's
time, and he's around, and I have
any minutes left, I'll maybe
consider handing it to him.

Suddenly Darian's door flies open, he rips Nadine's cell
phone out of her hand, then shuts and locks it again. Nadine
screams, bangs on the door.

Mona walks up just in time to observe this.

MONA
Hey watch it, that's nice wood.

NADINE
If he thinks I'm just gonna sit
back as he steals my best friend
and tries to edge me out, he has no
idea how wrong he is! No idea!

She stomps to her room, SLAMS the door. Mona looks concerned.
She walks over to the door, knocks.

MONA
Honey, can I tell you something?
It worries me when you're nostril
does that thing.

There's no answer.
46.

EXT. SHHS / FLAGPOLE - LUNCH TIME

Darian is introducing Krista to the flagpole crowd. Except
for Carly, they all greet her warmly. HEATHER and EMILIE (18)
two cute popular blondes, befriend her immediately.

HEATHER
I love your outfit, your shirt is
so cute, where'd you get it?

KRISTA
Thanks. Forever 21 I think?

EMILIE
Wow, that's so cool you're not even
embarrassed to admit that. We
should totally all hang out
sometime.

Just then, Nadine comes up, squeezes herself between Krista
and Darian, puts an arm around each, big smile.

NADINE
So where are we going to lunch
today, kiddos?

KRISTA
You're in a good mood.

NADINE
You know, I thought about it more,
and I'm actually kind of looking
forward to all the time the three
of us will be spending together...

DARIAN
(Dream on)
All the time?

NADINE
Speaking of which, I know how busy
you are Darian, so I went ahead and
picked this up for you.

She pulls out his NEW MONTH'S PRESCRIPTION OF IBS PILLS,
makes a big spectacle of it. He reddens, grabs it away,
stuffs it in his backpack.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Don't be embarrassed. A lot of
people have IBS. I bet a ton of
your friends do, too.

now, Nad--
NADINE

EXCUSE ME EVERYBODY, DARIAN'S
CONCERNED HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS
REALLY BAD IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME
TO THE POINT OF SEEING LIKE 4
SPECIALISTS AND NOBODY CAN SOLVE
THE MYSTERY OF HIS SUPER OVERACTIVE
BUTTHOLE. WOULD YOU JUST RAISE YOUR
HAND IF YOU HAVE IT TOO?

Nobody raises their hand.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Huh. I guess I stand corrected.

Darian wants to die.

SMASH CUT TO:
ANNOY THE SHIT OUT OF DARIAN MONTAGE --
INT. JACK IN THE BOX - DAY

At lunch, Nadine monopolizes the conversation with Krista,
making it impossible for Darian to join in.

NADINE
-+. so he dicks her over at the
rose ceremony and she's sobbing in
the limo and the blonde chick with
the Jay Leno chin is just like "oh
wow, it's true, he loves me and my
chin," but really...
Darian's in hell having to listen to this crap.
INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Darian and Krista watch a scary movie. As the action swells,
they start to snuggle together, getting cozy.

Nadine leans in from out of frame, holds out a box of CANDY.

NADINE
Care for a Milk Dud?

It totally kills the moment. Darian grits his teeth.

(CONTINUED )
48.
CONTINUED:

DARIAN
(whispers)
Does she really have to be here?

KRISTA
She's my best friend.

INT. MALL — DAY

Nadine keeps yanking Krista into girlie stores to try stuff
on, making Darian wait outside the dressing room for them.
He's bored to death, falling asleep.

EXT. NADINE'S HOUSE - EVENING

Darian's on the front porch trying to give Krista a good-
night kiss, but can't relax enough to do it, since a few feet
away Nadine has the GARDEN HOSE out, watering the lawn.

DARIAN
You seriously have to do that right
now?

NADINE
Yeah, like the low precipitation is
my fault.

He rolls his eyes, really tired of dealing with this.

DARIAN
(to Krista)
I'll just see you later.

Nadine fights a smile. It's working.
INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - DAY

Erwin and Nadine are lab partners, doing an experiment. She
has the spring back in her step.

ERWIN
Did you guys find a new lunch spot
or something? I haven't seen you
around this week.

NADINE
It's a long story.

ERWIN
Oh. Does it have to do with Krista
officially becoming girlfriend-
boyfriend with Darian?

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

49.

NADINE
(immediately looks up)
What? When did this happen? That's
impossible!

ERWIN
I - I'm not sure of the exact time
and location.

A GOSSIPY GIRL in front of them turns around.

GOSSIPY GIRL
Yesterday at 11:45 by the flagpole.

NADINE
I can't believe this.

ERWIN
I kinda can, they've been hanging
out a lot.

NADINE
And it's been hellish the whole
time! God, why would she not tell
me? Now they're probably going to
that stupid slutty girl's party
tonight, too...

ERWIN
What stupid slutty girl?

NADINE
I forget her name. Brown hair, her
pubes remind her of curly fries?

The GOSSIPY GIRL spins around again.

GOSSIPY GIRL
Carly Corvetti. She went out with
Darian for a week sophomore year
before he dumped her and she tried
to kill herself with a Schick
Quattro. She's never gotten over
him. Never.

Nadine lets out a groan, puts her head in her hands.

NADINE
Everything sucks. Everything sucks
a big wang right now.

Erwin thinks a sec.

(CONTINUED )
50.
CONTINUED: (2)

ERWIN
Okay, but what if tonight you did
something really cool to just, you
know, get your mind off things?
Like we could go to the La Habra
Corn Festival where they have rides
and games and probably maybe corn?
Or we could play mini-golf again?
Or go to Souplantation and eat like
45 bowls of soup and just be like,
"woooo00e, we're eating so much
soup, we're having so much fun, la
la la la!"

Erwin waves his arms like he's on a roller coaster.

NADINE
I don't think so.

ERWIN
Yeah, I was totally just kidding
about all that. Ah ha ha ha...ehh.

INT. NADINE'S ROOM - FRIDAY NIGHT

Nadine eats PEANUT BUTTER CUPS and stares in the mirror,
giving herself fake plastic surgery with Q-tips. One in each
hand, she pinches her nose to make it smaller, then lifts up
her eyes, then peels her lips back for an Angelina Jolie
effect. It looks ridiculous.

Krista stands at her door.

KRISTA
Sorry I didn't tell you earlier, I
just wasn't sure how you'd take it.

NADINE
Are you kidding? I'm so happy for
you guys, I think it's great.

Nadine puts on a big fake smile. Krista's not sure whether to
buy it.

KRISTA
Then why won't you come to this
party with us, it'll be fun.

NADINE
I told you, I just feel like having
a night in, ya know? Clean my
room... Finally catch up with
Harold...

(CONTINUED )
51.
CONTINUED:

She gestures to Harold, her BETA FISH. She notices he's
floating upside down.

KRISTA
Is he okay?

NADINE
I think that's just how he sleeps.

She taps on his tank. Nothing. Maybe not.

DARIAN
(comes out of his room)
Let's do it.

He heads for the stairs.

KRISTA
Sure you don't wanna come?

NADINE
I'm good. Go, go, have fun.

Krista hesitates a sec, but Nadine waves her off with a grin.
She leaves and Nadine drops the smile, then moves to her
window, watching the two of them walk down the driveway hand
in hand, Darian sweetly helping Krista into the passenger
seat.

Something about it makes her feel like absolute shit.
There's a KNOCK at the door, Mona and Jerry pop in.

MONA
You're really gonna stay home
tonight? Why don't you just tag
along with us?

NADINE
Because I'm having some me-time,
why does everyone act like that's
so pathetic, it's actually very
healthy, okay?

JERRY
Not if it's a Friday night. That
just makes you a loser. Hell, even
at our age.

NADINE
Thanks, Jerry!

CONTINUED: (2)

MONA
He doesn't mean it like that. Come
on, we'll have fun. Believe it or
not, your mom is not that awful to
hang out with.

Nadine thinks about it, not so sure.

NADINE
What are you guys gonna do?

INT. SUPER K-MART - A LITTLE LATER

Jerry and Mona are huddled around the SCRATCHER LOTTO TICKET
VENDING MACHINE up near the cash registers. They've scratched
about 30 tickets and keep shoving dollars into the machine.
It's poor man's Las Vegas.

MONA
(holds up ticket)
Oh my god, I won 2 dollars!

JERRY

Yay! I'll go redeem it with the

guy. Here, scratch these, Nadine.

He hands her a STRIP OF TICKETS and a DIME for scratching.

NADINE

This is where you guys hang out on

weekends?
MONA

We go to Target, too, but you know,

they can get all uppity...

Mona cracks open a MIKE'S HARD LEMONADE from the 6-pack they
just purchased there.

NADINE
Can you just drink that here, mom?

MONA
Not really. I brought a thermos.

She pulls a THERMOS out of her purse. Nadine's in hell.
EXT. CARLY CORVETTI'S HOUSE PARTY / FRONT YARD - SAME TIME

Total madness. Kids passed out on the lawn, a dude peeing in
a BIRD FOUNTAIN.
53.

EXT. CARLY CORVETTI'S HOUSE PARTY / BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

As Krista and Darian make their way through the party, people
eye her up and down, checking out Darian's new catch. If he
likes her, she must be hot.

KRISTA
I might be paranoid and just need
medication, but I feel like
everyone here is staring at me.

DARIAN
They are. Follow me, I'm gonna grab
another beer.

As she follows him through the crowd, the SOPHOMORE GIRLS who
made the Twins comment to Nadine, gaze at her, mesmerized.

SOPHOMORE GIRL #1
You're so beautiful, your hair's so
awesome !

SOPHOMORE GIRL #2
I know, and I love how you own your
freckles and just said screw it to
orthodontia!

KRISTA
Uh, thanks...

One of them snaps a cell-phone pic of her, enamored.
INT. CARLY CORVETTI'S HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS

Darian cracks open a beer, hands her one. Just then, Heather
runs over from the makeshift dance floor, grabs Krista.

HEATHER
Come on, come dance with us!

Before she knows it, she's with a big group of POPULAR GIRLS
all dancing in a circle. They cheer, pushing her into the
center of it. She's tentative at first, but starts to let go,
having a blast with this newfound popularity.

INT. SOUPLANTATION - A LITTLE LATER
Nadine and Erwin make their way down a giant SOUP BUFFET.
NADINE
Thanks, I really appreciate it. You

didn't have to get all dressed up,
honestly.

CONTINUED:

Erwin's in a FULL-ON SUIT & TIE. He looks like he's going to
a wedding. And he's incredibly nervous.

ERWIN
Oh, no, no, I was just -- I was
just dressed like this when you

called.
Nadine nods, not buying it. She moves down the buffet line.

NADINE
Mmm, clam chowder.

ERWIN
Ooh, I love clam, I could eat clam
all night long.

(eyes bulge, realizing)
No! I didn't mean it like that.
I seriously meant the real clam,
not the other clam! No, I mean the
other one is fine, too, it's great!
(beat)

What I'm trying to tell you is that
I like shellfish and I also like
the other shellfish -- at least
hypothetically -- but only one of
those things would I announce at
full volume in the Souplantation.

Nadine just looks at him.

NADINE
Erwin?
ERWIN
Yes?
NADINE
Let's not have anymore caffeine
tonight.
ERWIN
(nods )

Just water.
EXT. LA HABRA CORN FESTIVAL - A LITTLE LATER
Erwin munches on a GIANT EAR OF CORN while Nadine eats

CHOCOLATE COVERED BACON. They wait in line for the FERRIS
WHEEL. Erwin's relaxed a little.

NADINE
You know, I thought chocolate bacon
would be bad, and I'm surprised to
say: It's actually worse than that.
It's just a total miss on every
level.

ERWIN
I'm sorry.

NADINE
It's not your fault. Unless you
invented it?

ERWIN
No. That was not me.

NADINE
That was a joke. I didn't actually
think you invented chocolate bacon.

ERWIN
Okay.

It's their turn. They buckle up in the FERRIS WHEEL.

ERWIN (CONT'D)
Here we go...

NADINE
(as it takes off)
Wooooo0o0!
They reach the top.
ERWIN

Wow, look at that view...

TREES and BUILDINGS are completely blocking the view. Nadine
laughs.

NADINE
I think I can see Catalina...

Erwin smiles. They settle in.

NADINE (CONT'D)
So, tell me something while we're
on the ferris wheel. What are your
hopes and dreams, Erwin? What do
want out of life?

ERWIN
Oh, I don't know. I'm just an
average guy I guess.

NADINE
But if you had to expand for the
two minutes we're on this ride.

ERWIN
Well, I guess I do kinda wish
people at school didn't just
automatically stereotype me as the
nerdy Asian kid... There's a lot
more to me than that, and I feel
like if they could see it, they'd
realize I'm actually, well... kinda
cool even.

NADINE
Yeah? Like how?

ERWIN
I'm mean, not to brag or sound
totally full of myself, but, for
instance... I'm a crazy talented
flautist.

NADINE
As in... you play the flute?

ERWIN
Not just boring Mozart stuff, I can
play anything, I really jam on that
thing. Not to brag.

Another beat.

NADINE
This is just a suggestion, Erwin,
but if the goal is to up your cool
factor, I'm not exactly sure
"flautist" is the best approach.

Erwin shrugs. Yeah, maybe not...

She sighs,

ERWIN
How about you? What do you want out

I like animals a lot. We don't

Someday I'd really love to own a
monkey...

ERWIN
A monkey?

NADINE
They're illegal, it's almost
impossible, I'd have to get like 20
permits. I've thought about buying
one off the internet, but I read
about this girl who spent her life
savings to get a Squirrel Monkey
from Thailand and then it died 2
days later. That story depressed
the crap out of me, I couldn't get
out of bed for days.

ERWIN
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.

NADINE
It's okay.

sort of sit there a second, reflecting on that.

Erwin leans over and open-mouth kisses her.

NADINE (CONT'D)
(pushing him off)
What the hell are you doing?!

ERWIN
What?! I don't know! Was that bad
timing?! I thought that was good
timing? We're on the ferris wheel,
you were sad about the monkey, I
was comforting you?

NADINE
Oh. My. God.

ERWIN
Okay. Sorry. That was weird then.
That was bad.

NADINE
We gotta get off this thing.

ERWIN

Excuse me, sir, can you let us off?
She'd like to be let--

But they keep going around for another turn.

NADINE
It's fine. It's okay.

ERWIN
No, I feel awful. I'm gonna make it
up to you. I don't know how yet,
but I am.
(beat)
Maybe I should pay you.

NADINE
You're not paying me.

ERWIN
Not. No I am not.

INT. CARLY CORVETTI'S HOUSE PARTY / LIVING ROOM - LATER

Krista is still dancing with the popular girls when across
the room, she notices Carly standing close to Darian,
flirting it up. Heather sees it, too.

HEATHER
Yeah, you prob'ly want to break
that up, actually. Carly's kind of
a massive ho if the way her labia's
hanging out of her shorts hadn't
clued you in.

Krista observes them, a little uncomfortable. She finally
goes over.

KRISTA
Hey...

Carly backs off a little, fake-smiles.

CARLY
Oh hi.

DARIAN
Tearin' it up out there.

CARLY
I know, your forehead-sweat is like
hello.

Krista wipes her face, self-conscious.
DARIAN
You look great. You ready to get
out of here soon?

KRISTA
Sure.

CARLY
Seriously? It's barely lam.

DARIAN
I'm an old man, Carly. I can't keep
up with you.

CARLY
So that was the problem?

Darian gives her a look, puts his arm around Krista.

DARIAN
Thanks for the party.

EXT. NADINE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Erwin pulls his parents' MINI VAN in front of Nadine's house.

ERWIN
I had a good time.

NADINE
Me, too. Thanks again. See you
Monday?

ERWIN

(smiles, thumbs up)
Monday funday.

Nadine jumps out and Erwin waves goodbye. As soon as she
closes the door, his smile drops.

ERWIN (CONT'D)
You're an idiot and you're going to
go kill yourself now, okay? Okay.
60.

INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The house is dark and quiet. Nadine puts down her stuff,
stands there a moment, not sure what to do. She flips on the
HOME COMPUTER, logs onto Facebook...

She scrolls through Status Updates and Mobile Uploads --
everyone in the entire world is having more fun than she is.

She clicks on DAN GODWIN'S PAGE (Hot Soccer Dan), her cursor
hangs over the SEND FRIEND REQUEST BUTTON for a moment. She
chickens out, goes back to the home page.

AND THAT'S WHERE SHE SEES IT: "Krista Kaller has changed her
profile picture."

She clicks it open to see: It's gone from a pic of Krista and
Nadine, to a PIC OF KRISTA AND DARIAN uploaded at the party.
They couldn't look happier.

Nadine stares at it in disbelief. Pissed, she goes to her own
page, clicks "UPLOAD NEW PROFILE PIC," then opens her iPhoto,
searching for a pic of herself with someone other than
Krista. Except... they're ALL with Krista.

She closes iPhoto, frustrated. Drums her nails. Then boom, an
IDEA!

EXT. NADINE'S BACKYARD - NEXT DAY
Jerry teaches Nadine to play CROQUET. Mona sunbathes nearby.

JERRY
So what you wanna do is line this
up real straight and keep your eyes
on the thingy, you see? Now just
take a little swing...

Nadine hits the ball and it goes right through the thingy.

JERRY (CONT'D)
See! See that?! Ha! I always said
to your mom, I don't understand why
the kids won't play croquet with
me, croquet's a damn good time,

So I saw you changed your profile
picture.
NADINE
Oh... did I? Yeah, I guess I did.
KRISTA
I'm...not really sure what to say

about it.

61.

Intercut

Krista leans into her computer screen, getting a closer look.

In the pic, Nadine is hanging out at Golf N Stuff with her
arm around...AL PACINO. It's a pretty good Photoshop job, but

the dimensions are still slightly off.

NADINE
Yeah, I'm still pretty speechless
myself...

KRISTA

You photoshopped yourself at Golf N
Stuff with my favorite actor.

NADINE
How do you know I photoshopped it?
You don't know that.

KRISTA
He's wearing a tuxedo.

NADINE
So. So what. He's Al Pacino, he's
very comfortable in formal wear.

KRISTA

NADINE
Listen, I've just been thinking a
lot lately, okay? And the thing is,
last night I realized something
important.

KRISTA
And what's that.

NADINE
We're not Siamese twins, so we have
to stop acting like them.

KRISTA
Okay...?

NADINE

It's not like we share a torso and
since you decided to become a
country singer I just have to stand
there smiling and playing the
tambourine even though I hate
country music and I'm only doing it
because you have the liver.

KRISTA
What are you trying to say right
now?

NADINE

My point is, we're too codependent.
I think we need space.

KRISTA
Space?

NADINE
Space.

KRISTA

Well, I don't want space.

NADINE
I know, it'll be very rough.

KRISTA
I don't know why you're saying all
this. I feel like it's because of
Darian.

NADINE
Nope. Nope. Not at all why.

KRISTA
I feel like it is.

NADINE
No. Anyway, this is good, we'll

Krista sighs.
EXT. SHHS / PERFORMING ARTS HALL - LUNCH TIME

Nadine approaches the school's concert hall when she gets a
TEXT from Krista: "WHERE R U? WAITING 4 U 4 LUNCH."

EXT. SHHS / PENIS TREE - CONTINUOUS

Krista waits under their tree, gets a text back from Nadine:
"SORRY. HAVE PLANS."

She's shakes her head, clicks off her phone.
INT. SHHS / PERFORMING ARTS HALL - CONTINUOUS

Inside the concert hall, Nadine finds a couple of BAND
MEMBERS practicing, Erwin taking his FLUTE out of its case.

NADINE
So this is where you eat lunch. I
never knew.

ERWIN
Oh hi. Hey. Yeah, we practice in
here sometimes. These are my
friends, Brandon and Boyd.

BRANDON and BOYD, 16, are identical twins. Blonde, lanky,
Rosacea-faced. They're not dressed the same, but close.

NADINE
Hey, has anyone told you guys you
kinda look alike?

They just stare blankly at her.
NADINE (CONT'D)
Interesting how much better that
joke was in my head.
ERWIN

We can go somewhere else if you
want.

NADINE
No, no, practice. I brought my
burrito.
ERWIN

Oh... well, I don't know...

NADINE
Don't be nervous, I won't look at
you, I'll just stare at my feet if
that helps.

ERWIN
Uh... alright.

As Erwin gets up his nerve, Nadine finds a seat in the
theatre, pulls out her burrito. Erwin starts out slow, then
gathers confidence, until finally breaking into an awesome
rendition of Come on Eileen by Dexy's Midnight Runners. He
jams on it, adding a badass beat-boxing element.

Nadine drops her burrito, watching him in awe. It's
absolutely fucking incredible. When he finishes, she gives
him a standing ovation.

NADINE
Holy shit, are you kidding me,
Erwin?!

He kicks the ground, bashful.

ERWIN
Oh, be quiet...
(then)
Wait, you mean that in, like, a
good way, right?

NADINE
I can't believe you just beat-boxed
on that thing. Who are you?!

ERWIN
That's a new technique I'm trying
out.

NADINE

I don't know how else to say this,
but you have single-handedly made
being a flautist insanely cool.

Erwin smiles ear to ear, he could receive no bigger
compliment.
65.

EXT. SHHS PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL

Nadine's still singing and snapping as she walks toward the
SCHOOL BUS pick-up.

NADINE
Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he
means, at this moment you mean
eeeeevverythinnnnng...

Just then, she spots Krista across the parking lot, kissing
Darian goodbye. He heads off to football practice, and jumps
into Heather's waiting CONVERTIBLE with FOUR OTHER POPULAR
GIRLS. Heather turns up her music and the girls hoot and
cheer as they screech off.

Nadine suddenly feels like absolute crap, a lump gathering in
her throat. Not only is her plan not working -- it's
completely backfiring.

INT. NADINE'S GARAGE - LATER

Darian is lifting weights in the garage when Nadine bursts
through the door, announces:

NADINE
Krista has dandruff!

DARIAN
What?

NADINE

There's a Costco-size bottle of
Head and Shoulders in her shower,
if you don't believe me. If she
doesn't use it? Flakes the size of
shaved coconut. Not exaggerating.

Darian sets down the weights, sensing what this is.
DARIAN
Nadine, I know exactly what you're
doing and it's not--
NADINE
In the 7th grade, she had chronic
bacne.

He starts pushing her out of the garage.

DARIAN
Get out.

NADINE
People used to call her Unusually
Lot Of Bacne Person. Nobody even
took the time to give her a clever
name!

DARIAN
Nadine--

He's forcing her out the door.
NADINE
One time, she ran out of pads and
used her dad's tube sock!

He's got her out of the garage.

DARIAN
G'bye!
NADINE
FRESHMAN YEAR SHE POOPED IN A
TUPPERWARE CONTAINER!

This tidbit makes Darian pause a beat. Then he slams the door
on her.

INT. NADINE'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
Nadine tosses and turns in bed, unable to sleep because she
can hear Darian on the phone with Krista. He's giggling and
doing a little cutesy-wootsey voice.
She finally throws a BOOK at the wall.
NADINE

You've been on the phone for 2

hours. And stop doing that baby

voice, you're a grown freaking man!
He just giggles louder. She gives up, switches on her TV,
turns the volume up to drown him out. Flipping through
channels, she lands on the 1970's film, Carrie.

She's about to change it, but then something about it
intrigues her...

KRISTA
Oh you mean like an actual
conversation? Not just rushing me
off the phone or disappearing on
me?

NADINE
I know, I'm sorry. But I figured
something out last night. Something
big.

KRISTA
Okay.

NADINE
I'm worried you'll freak out when I
tell you, though, because it's
really unfair to you and it might
involve pig's blood.

KRISTA
It might involve pig's blood?

NADINE
And worse possibly. Fires. John
Travolta's car exploding.

KRISTA
What the hell are you talking
about, Nadine.

NADINE
Have you ever seen the movie,
Carrie?

KRISTA
I've never even heard of that
movie.

NADINE

So there's this girl, Carrie, and
she's all dicked up 'cause her
mom's a psycho and makes her read
the bible 20 hours a day or some
shit, I missed the beginning. But
the point is, there are these prick
popular kids who think it's funny

prom drenched in blood and her
eyeballs go all freaky and she
murders like a bajillion people.

KRISTA
And so you're saying?

NADINE
That -- and I'm sorry because I
know this sucks to hear -- Darian's

been screwing with you, Krista.

Krista just looks at her.

KRISTA
You think he asked me to be his
girlfriend as a dare, basically.

NADINE
Or probably to get back at someone.
Or to make someone jealous. And
probably that girl with the curly
fry pubes is my best guess.

Krista's conflicted.

I'm sorry. Seriously. You don't
deserve this and I'm so sorry.

Krista swallows, suddenly feeling sick.

got those big perfect boobs that
every guy dreams of!

DARIAN
And she's psychotic! And she's on
50 anti-depressants! And those big
perfect boobs aren't even real!

KRISTA
They aren't?

DARIAN
No, they are, I just thought that
would help my argument.
Krista's not in the mood.
DARIAN (CONT'D)
No, you know what? I'm taking care
of this right now.
He shuts his locker, angry.

KRISTA
But the bell already rang.

DARIAN
Just follow me.

Darian stomps off, Krista hesitates a moment, then follows
after him. He heads into --

INT. NADINE'S HEALTH CLASS - CONTINUOUS

Darian marches right past MR. PERRY (40's) who's writing
something on the chalkboard. Nadine studies a PLASTIC UTERUS.

(CONTINUED )
70.
CONTINUED:

NADINE
What are you doing? You can't just
walk in here and interrupt our
learning!

DARIAN
(to the teacher)
I'm borrowing her for a second.

NADINE
He doesn't have a hall pass, Mr.
Perry! He's hurting my finger! Oh
god, he has me in a choke hold!

Mr. Perry just shrugs and turns back to his blackboard.
EXT. NADINE'S CHEMISTRY CLASS - CONTINUOUS

The two of them burst out the doors, Darian still has her
head lodged under his armpit.

NADINE
(noticing Krista)
What the hell is this?

DARIAN
Apologize and tell her you're a
dumbshit for what you said.

NADINE
I'm not telling her crap!

DARIAN
Tell her mom ate too much soft
cheese when she had you, and that's
why you're a retard and a dumbshit.

NADINE
Fuck you, she never cared for soft
cheese and you know it!

Nadine tries to kick his shins. Darian squeezes tighter.
Krista looks on, alarmed.

KRISTA
Darian, let go of her, don't do
this.

DARIAN

Tell her you're sorry for making up
stories about crapping in
Tupperware!

(CONTINUED )
71.
CONTINUED:

Krista's eyes bulge. What did he just say?

NADINE
Stop it, let go of me!

He finally lets go.

DARIAN
I'm going to class.

He walks off, leaving Krista and Nadine standing there.
Nadine straightens her clothes.

NADINE
Thanks a lot for the help there, my
neck's about to be snapped and
you're like--
(imitates, eyes her nails)
Wow, I should really get my
cuticles cut...

KRISTA
You told him about the tupperware?!

NADINE
What? I'm sorry...

KRISTA
Why would you tell him that?!

NADINE
I don't know, it just...slipped out
in conversation.

KRISTA
Did you at least say it was your
fault, because you refused to pull
over?!

NADINE
Because I was trying to get to
Harry Potter on time because
they're your favorite movies!

KRISTA
God, you are unbelievable. I'm so
sick of this bullshit!

NADINE
Oh whatever, you love every minute!
Oooh, I have five million new
Facebook friends, look at me, I'm
hot shit all the sudden!

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

72.
(2)

KRISTA
You just can't deal with the fact
that I'm actually happy and have a
boyfriend and a couple friends
other than you!

NADINE
Oh right, get over yourself!

KRISTA
You get over yourself! I'm so tried
of kissing your ass and begging you
to be okay with me and Darian, I
don't give a shit anymore! I'm
done!

NADINE
Good, you think I give a crap?! I'm
done, too! D-O-WN!
(realizes)
E!

Krista stalks off. Nadine watches her go, a lump gathering in
her throat.

INT. ERWIN'S PARENTS' MINIVAN - LATER

Erwin nervously fusses with the radio, adjusting the volume.

ERWIN
Is my talk radio too loud for you?

Nadine has the passenger seat reclined to the horizontal
position, her jacket over her face.

NADINE
It's fine.

Erwin eyes her anxiously, not sure what to do.

ERWIN
Do you want some food? I have a
Rice Krispie Treat in my glovebox,
I can check if it's expired?

NADINE
No.

Nadine pulls the jacket off her face, looks over at him.

NADINE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry you have to deal with me,
Erwin. You're always so nice.

(MORE )

(CONTINUED )
73.
CONTINUED:
NADINE (CONT'D)
It makes me feel like a horrible

person.
ERWIN
You're not horrible.
NADINE
I'm not good like you. I steal from
the nut bins at Vons... I don't

really like old people...

ERWIN
I'd steal nuts. I'd totally steal a
nut.

Nadine looks off, heaves a sigh.

NADINE
I want to just leave and run away
and move to Alaska...

Erwin looks concerned.
EXT. STARBUCKS - A LITTLE LATER

Krista sits with Heather and the other popular girls, sipping
Frappuccinos and studying. She can't concentrate, the fight
with Nadine replaying in her head. Heather notices.

HEATHER
You okay? Did you have too much
caffeine and now you can't
concentrate and it's making you
fidgety and frustrated and also a
little horny in a weird way?

KRISTA
Um. I think I just have a lot on my
mind.

HEATHER
Hmmm.

Krista shakes it off, tries to focus.
EXT. NADINE'S ROOF - A LITTLE LATER
While Mona and Jerry make dinner, Nadine is splayed out on

the living room floor, hollow eyes gazing hopelessly at the
popcorn ceiling.

(CONTINUED )
74.
CONTINUED:

MONA
I'm not sure you want to lay on the
carpet, I haven't vacuumed up the
cat hair in a while.

NADINE
Uh huh.

MONA
Come on, Nader, why don't you make
the hummus for me? We could use
some help.

NADINE
Please don't call me Nader, it's
too close to neuter, I don't like
it.

Mona shakes her head.

MONA
You're so sensitive lately.

Nadine's phone rings: KRISTA. She immediately snaps out of
her coma, takes the phone and runs out to--

EXT. NADINE'S FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Nadine tries to figure out how she's going to play this.
Finally:

NADINE
(Mad Men voice)
Good afternoon, Draper residence.

Krista rolls her eyes, plays along. INTERCUT with her outside
Starbucks.

KRISTA
Hi Betty, it's Joan. Just called to
say I boned your husband because my
boobies are massive and it's what
we've all been waiting for.

NADINE
I'm sorry, I believe you have the
wrong number. Goodbye.

KRISTA
Nadine, wait. I'm sorry for what I
said, I feel really bad about it, I
can't think about anything else.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:
Nadine softens, drops the act.

NADINE
I know, me too... I'm really sorry
I told him about... the incident. I
kinda spilled the beans on some
other stuff, too, I feel really
guilty...

KRISTA
I don't know if I want to know.

NADINE
Probably not.

KRISTA
I think maybe it would help if we
spent some time together, you know?
Quality time, just you and me, like
the olden days.

NADINE

I'd really like that.
KRISTA

How about this weekend?
NADINE

Great. Sounds like a dealio.

(beat)
Punch me if I ever say "sounds like
a dealio" again, ‘kay?

Krista laughs.

KRISTA
‘kay.

EXT. SHHS HALLWAY - NEXT DAY
Nadine and Erwin walk and talk.

ERWIN
Well, that's really positive.

NADINE
Yeah, I think so.

ERWIN
It's like the saying, "Sometimes it
takes a big fight to move along and
repair things and get all better
and stuff..."

75.

(CONTINUED )
76.
CONTINUED:

NADINE
That doesn't sound like a saying.

ERWIN
It's...a Korean proverb.

He's the worst liar ever. Absolutely terrible.
NADINE
(rolls her eyes, laughs)
I love you, Erwin.
Erwin grins.

EXT. CAFE 50'S RESTAURANT - FRIDAY NIGHT

A campy throw-back restaurant with WAITRESSES IN POODLE
SKIRTS, ON ROLLERSKATES.

INT. CAFE 50'S RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Nadine and Krista follow the HOSTESS, slide into the booth,
sit, just look at each other. It's almost like a first date.

NADINE
Well, here we are.

KRISTA
Here we are...

NADINE
Just you and me.

KRISTA
You and me.

KRISTA (CONT'D)
So... what's new with you?

NADINE
Not much. What's new with you as
long as it doesn't have to do with
Darian, fun things you've done
together, the flagpole, or Darian?

KRISTA
I guess not much either then.

They just stare at each other for a few more beats, not much
more to say. Krista clears her throat, picks up the menu.

KRISTA (CONT'D)
Tuna melt sounds good...

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

77.

NADINE
Oh god, you're reading off the menu
because we have nothing to talk

about.
KRISTA

No I'm not, I just like tuna melts.
NADINE

Since when?
KRISTA

Since... I don't know. Recently?
NADINE

(Dramatic soap opera voice)
It's like we don't even know each
other anymore...

Krista laughs.

KRISTA
Your hair looks good by the way.
NADINE
Really? I'm wearing a Bump-it.
KRISTA
Your head looks amazing. Huge and
amazing.
NADINE

You always know the exact right
thing to say to me.

Krista laughs.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Hey, I gotta see how our hotdog
suits turned out. She's done with
them, right?

KRISTA
Um, yeah.

NADINE
I just hope they don't chafe or get
a billion degrees, you know what I
mean?

KRISTA

(hesitates a sec)
Yeah, well, uh --

(CONTINUED )
78.
CONTINUED: (2)

Before she can finish, the WAITRESS roll over.

WAITRESS
So what are we having, ladies?
NADINE
Dos tuna melts and Dr. Peppers
please.
(clarifies)

Dos is Espanol for two.
The waitress gives her a look. You think I don't know that?

NADINE (CONT'D)
Oh. And Espanol is Spanish for
Spanish.

WAITRESS
(beat)
Thank you.

She rolls away. Nadine leans across table, lowers her voice.

NADINE
That's my new thing I do, I tell
people really obvious shit like
they don't know it. That nice green
stuff outside is called 'grass.' It
keeps me entertained.

Krista laughs at how weird this is.

KRISTA
I've missed you, dude.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - A LITTLE LATER

Krista keys their bowling names into the score board. Nadine
walks up with a couple of DRINKS.

NADINE
Awww yeah, take a sip of this.

KRISTA
(takes a sip)
Woah, how'd you...?

NADINE
(smiles big)
I made friends with the bartender.

KRISTA
That guy?

(CONTINUED )
79.
CONTINUED:

Krista eyes the CREEPY-LOOKING BARTENDER. He waves.

NADINE
All we have to do is take some pics
in his van later.

KRISTA
Sounds perfectly safe to me.

They clink glasses, having fun. Nadine picks up her ball.

NADINE
Alright God, if I get a strike
right now, it means Hot Soccer Dan
will be my future husband and
Krista will one day pee-pee and
wipe her you-know with hundred
dolla billz.

Nadine goes for it. It veers to the left, then back to the
right, aaaaaand.... STRIKE!

KRISTA
Hhhhhoooooca000! !!!

NADINE
(victory arms)
Double rainbow across the sky!
They high-five each other, dance around.

CUT TO:

HAPPY BOWLING MONTAGE

--Krista does a few twirls and throws the ball with much
pizazz. It goes right into the gutter.

--Nadine tosses the ball backwards through her legs, it
bounces into another lane, knocking somebody else's ball off
course.

--The BARTENDER slides two White Russians in front of the
girls, winks.

--Krista gutterballs it again. This time, she runs after it,
pulls it out, and bowls it again from the middle of the lane.

--Krista throws a spare. She and Nadine lock arms, doing a
square-dance jig.

(CONTINUED )
80.
CONTINUED: (2)

--Krista and Nadine pretend to ice skate in their slippery
bowling shoes.

--Krista and Nadine are now bowling with the ROUGH-LOOKING
OLD COUPLE next to them who wear matching bowling shirts with
FLAMING BALLS AND PINS. Another round of DRINKS.

--The old man shows Krista proper bowling form, while the old
woman takes Nadine on a tour of her numerous tatoos.

--Nadine and Krista are wearing the old couple's BOWLING
SHIRTS now, all four of them with their arms around each
other, swaying and singing Creedence Clearwater's Have You
Ever Seen The Rain at the top of their lungs.

EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATER
The girls help the couple into their 1980's MOTORHOME.

NADINE
You guys are invited to the
holidays, I just want you to know.

KRISTA
And next time we're all getting
matching tattoos.

NADINE
Yes! Badass ones. A dragon giving
it to a beaver or something.
(beat)
I'm just gonna leave it to the
tattoo artist.

Nadine closes the door, they wave and drive off. Krista
shakes her head.

KRISTA
Oh, what a night.
NADINE
(sings)
Oh what a night! Da da da da back
in '63!
KRISTA

(sings along)
What a very special time for me!

NADINE KRISTA
AS I REMEMBER, WHAT A NIGHT! AS I REMEMBER, WHAT A NIGHT!

(CONTINUED )
81.
CONTINUED:

NADINE
Gayest song ever.

KRISTA
How do we even know that song?

NADINE
Because we're humongous gaylords.

It's official, they're back in their old BFF swing.

HEATHER (0.S.)
Krista, no way, what are you doing
here?

They turn around to see Heather and her 4 popular friends
approaching. Nadine's demeanor immediately shifts.

KRISTA
Oh, hi. We're just leaving.
This is my best friend, Nadine.
Nadine, this is Heather, Jen,
Emily, and Sienna.

Nadine smiles awkwardly, suddenly feeling very uncool.

NADINE
Hola...

They all wave and say hi.

HEATHER
Hey, so did you end up getting that
dress you tried on or what?

KRISTA
Um...
(glances at Nadine)
Yeah. Yeah I did.

HEATHER
Cool, and Futch's Uncle's gonna pay
for our limo 'cause he's super-
loaded and wants to fuck Jen.

Jen nods. That's right.

KRISTA
Oh good. Great.

HEATHER

Anyway, we're meeting up with the
guys, but we'll see you later?

(CONTINUED )
82.
CONTINUED: (2)

KRISTA
Yeah, have fun.

As they walk off, Krista turns to Nadine, not sure what to
say.

NADINE
Dress...? Limo?

KRISTA
Well, uh --

NADINE

You're going to prom with them
instead then.

KRISTA
Nadine, I--

NADINE
Screw you, I don't want to go with
you anyway!

Nadine starts speed-walking away, pissed.

KRISTA
Nadine. Wait! NADINE!

Nadine walks faster, then turns around, adds--

NADINE
You know what? I hope your new
friends still think you're cool
after they get a load of the way
you dance!

Nadine imitates, doing robot-hands and humping the air with a
goofy facial expression.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Yeah. That's how it looks. I never
wanted to tell you.

Krista doesn't know what to say, kind of stung. Nadine turns
around, keeps walking.

EXT. NADINE'S STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

Nadine wanders up to her house. He feet are completely
blistered from the long walk. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.
INT. NADINE'S HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
She drags herself down the hallway, into --

INT. NADINE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

83.

Her room is dark. She flips on her lights and sees Krista

sitting on her bed, waiting for her.

NADINE
Ew. That was creepy!

KRISTA
Give me a chance to explain.

NADINE
I don't want hear it.

KRISTA
I was gonna tell you, I was gonna
ask you to go with us.

NADINE
Oh kiss my ass! We had plans and
you just flushed them down the
toilet without a second thought!

KRISTA
That's not true, I had the suits
made and everything, I was planning
on it and then--

NADINE
What?

KRISTA
And then--

NADINE

And then what, Krista?

KRISTA
And then I realized I don't want be
a freaking hotdog for prom! I don't
want to act like it's just some big
joke to me! I want to wear a dress
and do my hair and I want to go
with an actual date, not you!

This hits Nadine where it hurts.

NADINE
Get out.

(CONTINUED )
84.
CONTINUED:

KRISTA
I didn't mean it like--

NADINE
GET OUT OF MY ROOM!!!

Nadine grabs her by the shirt and pushes her towards the
door. Krista screams. Darian opens his bedroom door.

DARIAN
What the hell's going on?!

Nadine keeps pushing her down the hallway. Krista starts to
cry, runs off down the stairs. The front door SLAMS.

DARIAN (CONT'D)
Jesus! What is your problem?

Nadine fights back tears.
NADINE
Why'd you have to do it, Darian?
You have everything in the world,
why'd you have to take my one
friend, too?
Darian pauses. He never thought of it like this.

DARIAN
Nadine...

She runs back to her room, shuts the door.
FADE TO:
EXT. NORFOLK POND - DAY
Where we left off from the opening scene. Nadine unzips her
large DUFFLE BAG and begins to unload the contents, including
TWO MASSIVE FOAM HOTDOG SUITS. She gathers it all up in her
arms, ready to toss it in. A passing JOGGER sees her.
JOGGER
Excuse me, that's polluting. You
can't do that.
NADINE
What, you're gonna call the cops on
me? Go ‘head.

He takes his CELL PHONE out, starts dialing.

(CONTINUED )
85.
CONTINUED:

NADINE (CONT'D)
Ah, crap.

She quickly shoves it all back in the bag.

INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Krista keeps calling Nadine, but Nadine keeps pressing
IGNORE. Ring, ignore. Ring, ignore. Ring, ignore. It's like a
little dance.

EXT. SHHS HALLWAY - DAY

Krista passes Nadine in the hallway. She tries to talk to
her, but Nadine walks right on by.

INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Nadine de-friends Krista on Facebook. Then un-follows her on
Twitter. Then logs onto MYSPACE -- a billion blinking POP-UP
ADS clog the screen, it's a total assault on the eyes.

NADINE
Ahhhhhhh! Make it stop!

She can't handle it, immediately closes out of it.
INT. SHHS / PERFORMING ARTS HALL - LUNCH TIME

While Erwin practices the flute, Nadine plays Sudoku with the
twins.

INT. NADINE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

Krista knocks on Nadine's door again and again. Nadine won't
open it, turns ANIMAL PLANET up to an obnoxious volume to
drown her out.

EXT. SHHS FLAGPOLE - LUNCH TIME

The popular group is laughing and having a good time, but
Krista's mind is somewhere else. Darian squeezes her hand,
checking if she's alright. She nods, but this is taking a
toll on her.

EXT. SHHS - LUNCH TIME

The penis tree has been all alone for weeks now. Two NERDY

FRESHMAN BOYS walk by. They point and laugh at the carving,
then noticing the spot is now vacant, claim it as their own.

(CONTINUED )
86.
CONTINUED:

That's it -- there's no going back now.

FADE TO:

INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - DAY

The whole class has their MICROSCOPES out for an experiment
where they put a piece of hair on a slide and alter it with
chemicals.

ERWIN
Hey, um, come check out this crazy
thing I found in my microscope.

NADINE
What do enzymes do to the hair
again? Turn it to goo or something?

ERWIN
Sorta, but just come look real
quick. You have to see this.

Nadine goes over and looks into his microscope. Spelled out
in pieces of ERWIN'S HAIR are the words WILL YOU PLEASE GO TO
PROM WITH ME?

NADINE
Oh my god. How'd you do that?!

Erwin smiles, super proud of himself.
ERWIN

It was extremely hard, I worked on
it for three weeks.

NADINE
Wow, that's amazing!
ERWIN
I know it's last minute, but...

will you?

Erwin's smile is massive and sincere. Nadine suddenly feels
uncomfortable.

NADINE
Oh. Um... Erwin, that's so nice of
you...

His smile starts to fall, sensing where this is going.

(CONTINUED )
87.
CONTINUED:

NADINE (CONT'D)

The thing is, I just... I don't
think prom's really my thing, I
wasn't planning to go.

Erwin swallows, his heart suddenly in his throat. Just then,
Nadine overhears the GOSSIPY GIRL talking on her cell phone.

GOSSIPY GIRL
Wait, did she dump Darian or did
Darian dump her?

NADINE
(trying to hear)
What? What'd she say?

GOSSIPY GIRL
(covers phone, tells lab partner)
Krista dumped Darian! They're not
going to Prom tomorrow, she
returned her dress and everything!

NADINE
What?! She did?!

LAB PARTNER
Why?!

GOSSIPY GIRL

I don't know, something about a
girl!

(into phone)
What girl? Who's this girl?

(beat, announces)
She forgets her name but she's
hairy and kinda looks like a human-
version of Alf?

NADINE
Oh my god! I'm hairy and look like
Alf! It's totally me!

GOSSIPY GIRL
Whatever.

NADINE
No, it really is! Oh my god, Erwin,
can you believe this?

Erwin can't say a word, still flattened from her rejection.
88.

EXT. SHHS HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER

Nadine runs to find Krista. She's by her locker, Heather and
the girls gathered around consoling her. They see Nadine and
back off, giving them privacy. Krista's eyes are swollen.

NADINE
Hey... I heard what happened.

Krista wipes her nose, trying to hold it together.

NADINE (CONT'D)
I - I'm sorry.

KRISTA
Are we friends again then?
NADINE
Krista, of course, I...
KRISTA
(bursts into tears)

Good.

She covers her face, runs off. Nadine is stunned. A little
ways down, Erwin is getting books from his locker.

NADINE
God, I think she's really upset.

He doesn't respond, chucks his CHEM BOOK into his locker.

NADINE (CONT'D)
What's wrong with you?

ERWIN
Do you know how long it took me to
snip all those hairs and make them
into little letters, especially the
'S' on 'please'?

NADINE
Erwin--

ERWIN
Sometimes you're so busy thinking
about yourself, you-- you forget
about everybody else.

He shuts his locker, walks off. Nadine swallows.
INT. MONA'S BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

Nadine sits, fully clothed, in her mom's empty whirlpool tub.
She picks through a BOWL OF POTPOURRI, staring in a deep dark

void.
Mona pokes her head in.

MONA
What are you doing in here.

Mona notices the tears in her eyes, comes in.
MONA (CONT'D)
Well, based on the music Darian's
playing, I can take a wild guess
what this is about.
Nadine looks off, heaves a sigh.

NADINE
I feel awful...

Mona walks over to the tub.

MONA
Mind if I join?

Mona climbs into the empty tub next to Nadine. They just sit

there silently a moment.

MONA (CONT'D)
Isn't this what you were after the
whole time.

NADINE
Not like this...

Beat.

NADINE (CONT'D)
I've never seen Krista cry like
that before... it was so sad. And
then Erwin, I even hurt Erwin, and
he's the nicest person ever. Last
week he had a spider in his car and
felt too bad killing it so he just
kept trying to shoo it out the
window. It bit him like four times
in the process...

She shakes her head, thinking.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

90.

NADINE (CONT'D)
I don't know, mom... I just wanted
things to be like they were, you
know? When Darian came along it
just changed everything.

Mona puts an arm around Nadine, pulls her close.

MONA
Honey, being friends would be easy
if everything always stayed the
same... you always lived right down
the street from each other, had the
same hobbies, were single and not-—
single at the same time. But you
grow up and realize your lives
aren't always going to intersect so
neatly. Hell, next year you two may
go off to different colleges...
Couple years after that, maybe
she's married with a baby while
you're out freaking some Italian
guy you just met at the club. Do
they still call it "freaking" or is
that over now?

NADINE
Pretty sure that one's done.

MONA
You get my point though. A lot of
friendships can't handle change.
But the good ones... they adjust.
If you really care about each
other, you find a way to make it
work.

Nadine lets this sink in. After a moment, she puts her arms
around Mona, hugs her tight.

NADINE
I love you, mom.

MONA
I love you too, hon.
(beat, looks around)
I'm gonna take more baths.

EXT. DARIAN'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

REM's "Everybody Hurts" wails from Darian's room. Nadine

knocks.

(CONTINUED )
gl.
CONTINUED:

After a moment, he opens the door, turns down the music. He's
eating a BEEF STICK (he's already eaten like 12) and looks
like a wreck.

NADINE
I'm sorry I was an asshole.

Darian sits down on the edge of his bed.

DARIAN
I swear I never meant to mess up
your life, Nadine.

NADINE
Darian --

DARIAN
No, I'm serious. I really wish I
would've fallen for somebody else,
but I.... I can see why she's your
best friend. She's amazing.

Nadine can tell how sincere he is.

NADINE
You've gotta take her to prom
tomorrow.

DARIAN

She doesn't want to go.

NADINE
I have a plan to fix that. I kinda
need your assistance, though.

DARIAN
What do you need?

NADINE
A ride some places, help with a few
errands, and if you happen to know
the lead singer of Radiohead and/or
someone who does sky-writing?

DARIAN
(are you kidding me?)
No.
NADINE
Might have to switch some things
around then. No biggie.

Darian laughs, throws her a beef stick.

(CONTINUED )
92.
CONTINUED: (2)

DARIAN
Let's do it.

INT. MALL - AFTERNOON

Darian and Nadine burst through the mall doors, where they
meet Heather, quickly follow her up the ESCALATOR.

INT. SHHS / MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - EARLY EVENING
Nadine follows Darian into the empty men's locker room.

DARIAN
You can't tell anyone about this.

Nadine locks her lips, throws away the key.

NADINE
So this is the guy's locker room..

DARIAN
Exciting, huh.

NADINE
Smells like taco seasoning.

Darian approaches a STORAGE CLOSET labeled "FIELD
MAINTENANCE."

DARIAN
Pretty sure it's in here.

EXT. PARTY CITY - EVENING

Darian idles outside PARTY CITY. Nadine runs towards him, her
arms loaded with SHOPPING BAGS. She jumps in, he zooms off.

EXT. ERWIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Darian cuts the engine, quietly rolls up along Erwin's curb.
They quietly slide out of the car, creeping through the dark.
Nadine dives onto the grass, crawling on her belly military-
style.

DARIAN
(whispers )
You think that's necessary?

He's just walking normally.

NADINE
I did at first, but this grass is
really wet.

(MORE )

(CONTINUED )
93.
CONTINUED:
NADINE (CONT'D)
(beat)

‘kay, that's poop, I'm getting up.
She pops up. They tip-toe up the driveway.
EXT. HABIBI RESTAURANT & DANCE CLUB - NIGHT
Darian and Nadine approach a crowded Persian Dance Club, a
line of CLUB-GOERS down the block. Even from the street, you
can hear the Persian singer WAILING AWAY.

DARIAN
This is it?

NADINE
That's what mom told me...

They get in line, both looking very nervous about this.
INT. NADINE'S HALLWAY - LATER

It's 2am. Nadine and Darian are exhausted. They give each
other a tired high-five, Nadine collapses into bed.

FADE TO:
EXT. ERWIN'S FRONT PORCH - MORNING
ERWIN'S DAD opens the front door, bends down to pick up the
NEWSPAPER when something across the front yard catches his
eye. He stands bolt upright.
ERWIN'S DAD
(in Korean)
Erwin! Get out here right now!
Erwin comes to the door in his pajamas to behold:
His MINI-VAN has been decorated with a million colorful
streamers, balloons, confetti, the windows shoe-polished with
little stars and happy faces and messages like "Erwin
freaking rocks!"
A huge smile spreads across his face.
EXT. DARIAN'S PICK-UP TRUCK - A LITTLE LATER

Nadine driving Darian's pick-up when her phone rings.
Intercut between her and Erwin.

(CONTINUED )
94.
CONTINUED:

ERWIN (0.S.)
Did you happen to decorate my mom's
van with a bunch of streamers and
stuff?

NADINE
Maybe. Do you like it?

ERWIN
It's pretty amazing.

NADINE
So...is it too late to change my
mind about prom?

Erwin clears his throat.

ERWIN
For you, madame, I just may grant
an extension...

(beat)
That voice was kinda weird, sorry.

NADINE
(laughs)
I can't wait.
Nadine clicks the phone off just as she pulls up outside
KRISTA'S HOUSE, behind a parked MERCEDES. A person sitting in
the driver's seat waves to her. She waves back.

NADINE (CONT'D)
Show time.

Nadine swallows, nervous.
INT. KRISTA'S BEDROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Krista is folding laundry on her bed when she hears something
strange outside...

It almost sounds like Radiohead's Karma Police, except
something about it is not quite right.

She moves to the open window, looks down to see she's being
serenaded by --

A PERSIAN MAN (45) -- big mustache, long pony tail,

iridescent shirt unbuttoned to reveal copious chest hair and
gold jewelry.

(CONTINUED )
95.
CONTINUED:

He's standing below her window with a guitar, singing Karma
Police in a very thick accent, about 10x more up-tempo, and
with lots of little middle-eastern vocal trills.

He tosses his hair and dances in place, feeling the rhythm.

During this performance, Nadine pushes a little machine onto
Krista's front lawn. It's a FOOTBALL FIELD PAINTER. She
wheels it across the grass, spelling out he words "I'M
SORRY." It's not sky-writing, but close.

Krista can't help but laugh. The dude finishes the song and
they both clap.

NADINE
I wanted to get Thom Yorke but he
wasn't available, and, well, my
mom's cousin Hamayoun was. He's
kinda awesome though, right?

KRISTA
I can't believe you did all this.

NADINE
(re: field paint)
Don't freak out, it comes off. Oh,
also--

Nadine pulls a DRESS BAG out of the pick-up: Krista's
returned PROM GOWN.

NADINE (CONT'D)
We have an appointment at the salon
in 10 minutes.

Krista grins.

INT. HAIR SALON - A LITTLE LATER

QUICK SHOTS of the two girls getting beautified by the same
LADY who waxes Nadine's mustache:

1. Nadine's nails are painted fire engine red. She makes a
little claw with her hand. Arrrrggh.

2. Krista lets out a series of yelps as her eyebrows get
waxed.

3. Nadine's hair is flat-ironed, plumes of smoke coming off
it. "Smoke is normal, right? Smoke is fine?"

(CONTINUED )
96.
CONTINUED:

4. Krista's thin blonde hair is ratted and curled piece by
piece.

5. Nadine puckers her lips for lipstick application.
6. Krista holds still as the final false eyelash is glued on.
INT. HAIR SALON - LATER

Nadine is being sprayed with hair-spray when Krista walks out
of the back room, all ready: Dramatic make-up, hair in pin-
curls, a slinky floor-length electric blue dress. A whole
1950's Marilyn Monroe pin-up girl look.

NADINE
Holy crap, you look hot.

KRISTA
Wait, I just realized, what are you
gonna wear?

NADINE
I picked something up last night
when we got your dress back. I
might've lost my mind though.

Nadine ducks into the other room just as Erwin's still-
decorated minivan screeches up to the curb, streamers flying,
music blaring. Darian and Erwin hop out, both in tuxes,
pumped up for the night.

DARIAN
Who's ready for proooommmm
niiiiight?

ERWIN
Awwwww yeah! We're gonna party
on and on 'til the break of dawn!
Or 'til we get tired!

Nadine walks out in a SHORT, FUNKY, ZEBRA-PRINT DRESS. It's a
style all her own, she looks awesome.

DARIAN
Wow, sis.

NADINE
Is the zebra print too much? I was
aiming for something between "I'ma
party animal" and "I watch a lot of
Animal Planet." What do you think?

(CONTINUED )
97.
CONTINUED:

ERWIN
Bullseye.

KRISTA
You look amazing.

Nadine smiles.

NADINE (V.0)
All in all, prom night turned out
to be pretty big success.

INT. SHHS PROM - LATER

A LIVE BAND plays, everyone dances their asses off. Nadine,
Krista, Darian, and Erwin tear it up.

NADINE (V.O.)
The food was good. Lotta white guys
got drunk and thought they could
breakdance.

Futch tries to do a spin on his back, but just sort of
awkwardly rolls around on the floor.

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Erwin's friends seemed to be having
fun, too.

A few feet away, Erwin's twin buddies, Brandon and Boyd, are
wearing the HOTDOG SUITS and getting a shitload of attention
from girls, including Carly Corvetti. She vigorously freaks
one of the hotdogs.

CARLY
Is that a foot long?

He smiles huge.
Nadine turns to Krista.

NADINE
I'll be right back, 'kay?

She weaves through the crowd towards the LIVE BAND, when a
hand grabs her shoulder. She looks back to see the hand
belongs to Hot Soccer Dan.

NADINE (CONT'D)

(freezes, flushed)
Oh. Hi.

(CONTINUED )
98.
CONTINUED:

The moment has finally come. He looks her right in the eyes.

HOT SOCCER DAN
You...just stepped in vomit.

NADINE
(beat)
Thank you so much.

He nods and walks off. Nadine beams, cheerily stepping out of
the barf.

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Yep. Things were really looking up.

She heads towards the stage, whispers something to the LEAD
SINGER of the band. He nods and they start to play Michael
Jackson's Beat It. The crowd goes nuts.

Nadine gestures to one of the twins, who pulls Erwin's FLUTE
out of his hotdog suit, hands it to him.

ERWIN
Whoa. ..what?

NADINE
Why don't you show these assholes
who's boss.

Erwin's a deer in headlights. Nadine smiles, urging him on.
After a moment, he starts tentatively playing along. A small
crowd gathers. He gains confidence and the crowd gets bigger
and bigger until everyone at prom is watching him tear it up,
beat-boxing like a badass.

A NERDY LITTLE PROM-GOER looks at the massive cheering crowd,
disappointed in himself.

NERDY PROM-GOER
I should've never quit flute...

NADINE (V.O.)
From there the night was kind of a
blur, but went something like this:

TIME CUT --

NADINE (V.O.)
We danced a bunch more.

1. Krista does her famous humping-robot dance. 2. Nadine slow-
dances with a hotdog. 3. Erwin and Darian whip their hair to
Willow Smith's Whip My Hair.
99.

TIME CUT--

NADINE (V.O.)
We took some pictures.

INSERT: Series of funny, awkwardly-posed prom photos.

TIME CUT--
NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
They played the last song.
BAND'S LEAD SINGER
Last song, party people!
TIME CUT--

Everyone's arms are locked, singing along to Bye Bye Miss
American Pie.

NADINE (V.O.)
Some chicks cried.

As they sing along, several girls weep. "School's almost
over..." Even Nadine & Krista fight a tear.

TIME CUT--

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
We decided to go to Denny's.

They walk into Denny's. At 3am, it looks like the runway for
the apocalypse. Every patron seems vaguely suicidal.

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
We decided not to go Denny's.

TIME CUT--

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
We finally made it back home.

They pile out of Erwin's van with bags of In-n-Out.
INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
NADINE (V.O.)
And as I drifted off to sleep that
night--

They're spread across the living room in sleeping bags,
everyone passed out except Nadine.

(CONTINUED )
100.
CONTINUED:

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Erwin drooling peacefully on the
decorative pillow next to me,
Krista and Darian snoring in
perfect sync... I was overcome with
a rare but unmistakable feeling:

A small, almost undetectable smile comes across her face.

NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Things were pretty alright.
As Nadine's eyes flutter shut, we---

FADE OUT.

THE END.
