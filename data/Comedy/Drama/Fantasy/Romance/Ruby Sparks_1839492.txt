Fade up on a dreamy image of a woman, backlit by the sun.

WOMAN
There you are. I’ve been looking for you.

She walks toward camera with a strange uneven gait, then
stops.

WOMAN (CONT’D)
Have you seen my other shoe? I’m always
losing things.

She looks around for the shoe, then notices something.

WOMAN (CONT’D)
(to camera) What?

She smiles and moves in closer.

WOMAN (CONT’D)
Why are you looking at me like that?

BLARING ALARM SOUND.
CUT TO:
INT. CALVIN’S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING.
CALVIN (29) wakes, jolted, alone in bed. A porn DVD menu is
on the TV. Calvin turns the TV off with the remote, pulls
his sheets away from his body. They are sticky.
EXT. SILVERLAKE STREET. LATER
Calvin stands in his sweats at the side of the road. His
body has obviously not seen sunlight for quite some time.
Calvin's dog SCOTTY, small and sensitive, sniffs around.
CALVIN

Go potty. Go potty. Go potty. Go

potty. Go potty. Go potty. Scotty. Go

potty.
Scotty squats and pees like a girl dog.
INT. CALVIN’S KITCHEN. LATER.
This is a nicer house than we would expect a guy this young

to have. Very little furniture, but everything is expensive.
Calvin pours coffee. Toast pops up. Scotty waits for scraps.
He Loves Me 6/09/11 Draft 2.

INT. CALVIN’S OFFICE. LATER.

Calvin places the toast and coffee carefully next to the
typewriter on his desk. Everything in the room is white:
desk, floor, walls. Scotty tries to come in. Calvin shuts
the door.

CALVIN
No Scotty.

Calvin sits. Silence. He positions his hands over the keys.
A page sits in the typewriter. Blank. Calvin's face. Also
blank. CUT between the page and Calvin. It’s like a
staring contest.

The phone rings, loud, jarring. Calvin answers.

CALVIN (CONT'D)
Yes?

INT. GYM. MORNING.
Calvin and Harry are strapped into weight machines that bear

more than a passing similarity to Medieval torture devices.
Harry stands next to Calvin, spotting him.

HARRY

Great way to start the day, right?
CALVIN

I think I’m going to throw up.
HARRY

How was your date last week?
CALVIN

Okay.
HARRY

Okay as in you got laid?

CALVIN
Harry.

He gestures at a woman working out next to them, earbuds in.

HARRY
What? She can’t hear you.
(Loud)
Don’t you want to have sex? Like ever
again?

CALVIN
The only reason girls ever want to sleep
with me is that they read my book in high
school.

HARRY
So?

CALVIN
So they're not interested in me, they’re
interested in...some idea of me.

HARRY
That’s why you have to work out. So
they’11 want you for your body.

CALVIN
(RE: the machine)
What does this thing even do?

HARRY
It turns you into a god. Keep it up.

CALVIN
.-.-I had a weird dream last night.
There was this girl--

HARRY
What’d she look like?

CALVIN
...like a normal girl, someone I made up.

HARRY
Did you have sex?

CALVIN
No, she just talked to me.

HARRY
That's fucking depressing.

CALVIN
It was actually really nice.

HARRY
Seriously? You don’t even get laid in
your dreams? That’s just sad.
(He finishes his reps.)
So how’s the book coming?

INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE. LATE AFTERNOON.
CLOSE UP on Calvin's face, looking up at camera.

CALVIN
I don’t know. I don’t know. I get an
idea, a good idea, like, why don’t I
write about my dad? And BAM, I start
thinking that is the stupidest thing
ever, who wants to read about “He was
disappointed in me, bla bla bla.” But
then I’m sitting there, alone, in front
of my typewriter all day, and maybe I get
something to eat, and all I can think
about is how every second I’m getting
older and he was right, what am I doing
with my life? And also. Also I am
feeling ambivalent about Scotty.

A beat. We hold on Calvin.

CALVIN (CONT'D)

It’s true. I’m feeling very ambivalent
about Scotty. Dogs can be really
annoying. He slobbers. He chews things.
He pees like a girl, which for some
reason makes me feel inadequate. But
then I feel bad, because if I don’t love
him, who will?

(Pause)
Plus he needs to go outside a lot, and it
breaks up my day. Maybe that’s why I’m
not writing?

We see: DR. ROSENTHAL. Smart, fifties. He looks bemused.
DR. ROSENTHAL
Do you think that’s why you’re not
writing?

Calvin has somehow managed to squish his body into a fetal
position in the chair.

CALVIN
No.

DR. ROSENTHAL
Why do you think you’re not writing?

CALVIN
...Can I have Bobby now?

(CONTINUED)
He Loves Me 6/09/11 Draft 5.
CONTINUED: 7

DR. ROSENTHAL
Do you need Bobby now?

CALVIN
Yes.

Dr. Rosenthal gets up and goes to a cabinet. Calvin follows
him with his eyes.

DR. ROSENTHAL
Calvin. When was the last time you saw a
friend?

CALVIN
Harry, yesterday.

DR. ROSENTHAL
Someone other than your brother?

Calvin doesn’t answer. Dr. Rosenthal comes over and hands
him a plush teddy bear: Bobby. Calvin holds it. Dr.
Rosenthal goes back to his seat.

DR. ROSENTHAL (CONT'D)
How was your date Tuesday?

Calvin plays with Bobby's ears.

CALVIN
I don’t know that I’m really a dating
kind of person. Just the prospect of
like...childhood stories, relationship
histories, “You’re depressed? Oh my god
I’m depressed”... Besides, if I haven’t
written that day, that’s all I can think
about. Have you been giving Bobby to
your other patients?

DR. ROSENTHAL
No, Bobby’s just for you.

CALVIN
‘Cause he smells weird.

DR. ROSENTHAL
Calvin. When you were deciding to get

Scotty, what did we talk about? What did
you say you hoped for? Do you remember?

Calvin mutters something.

DR. ROSENTHAL (CONT'D)
A little louder please.

CALVIN
That he would be awesome and we’d take
hikes and stuff. And I would meet people
when they stopped to pet him. But Scotty
gets scared when people try to pet him.

DR. ROSENTHAL
Does that embarrass you?

CALVIN
(Big fat lie)
No.

DR. ROSENTHAL
.-.I want to give you a writing
assignment.

CALVIN
I can’t write.

DR. ROSENTHAL
Okay. This would just be for me. I'd
like you to write, just a page, about
someone who sees Scotty, all slobbery and
scared, and likes him anyway. Just the
way he is. Do you think you could do
that for me?

Beat.

CALVIN
Can it be bad?

DR. ROSENTHAL
I would like it to be very bad.

INT. HAMMER MUSEUM. EVENING.

CLOSE ON: Scattered hardcover books surround A BLOWN UP
POSTER OF A BOOK COVER propped on a table. It reads:

HEARTBROKEN OLD TIMES
By Calvin Weir-Fields
~Tenth Anniversary Edition~

LANGDON THARP (0.S.)

The first time I met Calvin, he was 19
years old and had already been at the top
of the New York Times Best Seller List
for months.

He Loves Me 6/09/11 Draft 7.

CONTINUED: 9

A crowd of well-dressed people sit watching: LANGDON THARP,
literary god. Late forties and enjoying the attention from
the stage.

LANGDON THARP (CONT'D)
I thought: who the fuck is this kid?
And how can I go back in time and be him?

Laughter. Calvin stands in the wings.

LANGDON THARP (CONT'D)
This skinny high school drop out with
acne still on his chin gave us what very
well may become a classic American novel.

Someone pats Calvin on the shoulder.

LANGDON THARP (CONT'D)

Since then, we've had the pleasure of
reading his short stories, and of course
last year’s novella “Breakfast for
Dinner.” But it wasn’t until I sat down
to re-read his novel--

(Holding up the book)
--in this beautiful new edition--that I
remembered quite how good Calvin Weir-
Fields is.

Langdon turns, a strange edge to his voice.
LANGDON THARP (CONT'D)
Ten years ago or ten years from now,
we're lucky to have him around. Ladies
and Gentlemen, Calvin Weir-Fields.

People applaud. Calvin walks onstage. Langdon shakes his
hand. Flashbulbs. Calvin takes the mic, ready to speak.

JUMP CUT TO:

INT. MUSEUM BATHROOM. LATER. 10*

Calvin splashes water on his face. Water drips off his hair,
nose, eyelashes. He looks like a drowning man.

INT. MUSEUM. HALL. JUST AFTER.
Calvin walks down the wall. Cyrus pops in from around the
corner. Cyrus is either a good guy who comes off as a douche,
or a douche who gives phenomenal “good-guy.” No one knows.
CYRUS
There’s the man!

He Loves Me 6/09/11 Draft 8.

CALVIN
You have to remind me about these things.

CYRUS
Check your messages buddy.

CALVIN
I would have at least worn a real shirt.

CYRUS
No one cares what you wear, you’re a
genius.

CALVIN
Don’t use that word.

INT. MUSEUM AUDITORIUM. JUST AFTER.

Calvin makes his way up the stairs out of the auditorium.
People press forward to speak to him.

PARTY-GOER 1
Phenomenal, man. Just brilliant.

PARTY-GOER 2
Brilliant.

CALVIN
Thanks for coming.

OLDER DUDE
Hey, man, you know that chapter where
Charlie goes to the whorehouse? Did you
make the whore’s dress blue because it
was the same color as his mother’s apron?

CALVIN
...Sorry, what?

A SORT OF WEIRD GUY cuts in, a little too close to Calvin.

SORT OF WEIRD GUY
Calvin. Calvin. Calvin. So. How did
you know where to send your manuscript?

CALVIN
Uh, I looked it up.

SORT OF WEIRD GUY
Where?

CALVIN
On the internet.

Is it weird for you that you used to be
so successful?
INT. MUSEUM. RECEPTION AREA (BY BILLY WILDER PORTRAIT).

Langdon pulls Calvin into a group of writers for a photo.

LANGDON THARP
Say “Disillusionment.”

No one smiles. Flashbulbs go off. Cyrus steps in.

CYRUS
Hey, Cyrus Modi, huge fan.

INT. MUSEUM. RECEPTION AREA. LATER.

The crowd mills about. The Sort Of Weird Guy chats up
Calvin. Cyrus interrupts.

CYRUS
Look, pink litchi-tinis!

CALVIN
I don’t want to hold this.

CYRUS
I know it looks gay. Try holding two of
them. Now go, sign copies, sell books.

CALVIN
I was thinking of heading home.

Cyrus laughs.
LATER. 12

Party is more intense. A CUTE HIPSTER GIRL tries to chat up
Calvin at the bar. They both have to shout over the noise.

CUTE HIPSTER GIRL
Mabel!

paper)

No, do you want my number?
LATER. ELEVATOR FOYER.

Calvin is sandwiched between the Coordinator and MICHAEL
SILVERBLATT, talking intently into his ear. They head into
the bookstore.

MICHAEL SILVERBLATT
You know my show Bookworm--?

CALVIN
Yeah, of course I--

MICHAEL SILVERBLATT
Well, I have to tell you I love the first
book, but what we really want is for you
to come on the show and talk about what
you’re working on now, NOW is the
question--

LATER. BOOKSTORE.
Langdon chats up some women.
LANGDON THARP
Of course, Calvin always had talent, but
that will only get you so far. I helped
hone him, give him some style. It was a
passing of the baton, really.
LATER.
Mabel continues to hit on Calvin as he signs her book.
MABEL
My favorite was that story you had in
McSweeny’s last fall? About the guy
trying to buy a jacket?

Langdon chats up some more women.

LANGDON THARP
Everyone sits at home and thinks, “I
could do that, a monkey could do that.”
But one’s muse is incredibly difficult.
You have to seduce her, finesse her.

LATER.

A tiny intimidating older FEMALE PROFESSOR intensely grips
Calvin’s arm.

FEMALE PROFESSOR
At first I resisted teaching your book,
but the longer I considered it, the more
I saw its corollary to Roth and Mailer,
so I thought, if I’m going to include
anyone contemporary, it really must be
Calvin Weir-Fields--

LATER.
Langdon chats up even more women.

LANGDON THARP
People think of writing as cerebral, but
its actually an incredibly physical,
almost sensual act. You should see me
write. I’m like an Olympian. With a pen.

LATER.

Mabel’s kneeling by the table as Calvin signs other people's
books. She has a drink.

MABEL
I was so in love with Charlie. He was
like my ideal in high school. I mean I
know he’s not real. But he kind of is,
right? Like, your name starts with “C”
and so does Charlie... I mean, it’s like
autobiographical, right?

LATER.
Quieter. Langdon leans against a wall by Calvin. Drunk.

LANGDON THARP
They love you and then they throw you
away. It’s easier if you’ve only ever
been mediocre. When you’ve been to the
top, it can kill you.

Also a puddle

Calvin examines the remains of the books. One of them was
his copy of “CATCHER IN THE RYE.” Calvin lets it drop from

his fingers in defeat or exhaustion.

Calvin throws his pillow and comforter on the couch and
collapses on top of them. He wraps himself in the comforter

Calvin is sitting on the grass, a book open in front of him.
Standing a few feet away is the GIRL from his dream. She

pretty much the best.

GIRL
Okay.
(Going back to her sketch)
But I don’t think you like him very much.

CALVIN
What?

GIRL
Naming your dog after him? It’s a little
disrespectful.

CALVIN
It’s a gesture.

GIRL
Yeah, an aggressive gesture. Think about
it: you're a novelist, you think this
guy is the greatest, you name your dog
after him to cut him down to size. Now
you can put him on a leash and yell “Bad
Scotty” and feel all superior ‘cuz you
pee inside. Kill your idols, man, I’m all

whiteout. Scotty runs in with a HIGH HEELED SHOE in his
mouth. Calvin looks at it weird, then throws it for Scotty.
Scotty chews on the high heel. Calvin types like a mad

You tell me.

Oh god Scotty.

It’s Scotty's?

No, asshole. Scotty’s been dragging
stuff in. I think he goes through my

So that’s some random dirty bra?

Gross.

Calvin walks to the hall, opens a drawer and drops the bra
in.

Apparently Calvin has been collecting women’s things. In
addition to the bra, there’s a pair of panties, a stocking, a

Women are different up close. I love

HARRY
I certainly didn’t pretend I invented
her, Calvin.

CALVIN
You said she was your dream girl. That’s
what happened to me. My heart got broken
in a thousand pieces, I didn’t think I
would ever love anyone again. And then I
had a dream, and the dream made me think,
hey, maybe there is a girl out there for
me. I imagined what she looked like and
smelled like and all her favorite things.
And one day I woke up and she was there.
And turns out, she makes me happy. She
makes me feel not alone on this planet.
Now I know this isn’t how most people

Harry laughs.

The unfortunate thing about having kids
is that for a few years, they only like
to show you the worst parts of
themselves. The good parts they save for
their friends. It’s fine. As long as I
know he isn’t like this all the time.

RUBY
..-He isn’t.

Gertrude raises her eyebrows at Ruby. Ruby just smiles.
Gertrude pulls the photo album across the table and flips a
few pages. She turns it toward Ruby.

GERTRUDE
Look.

CLOSE ON the photo: A MIDDLE AGED MAN with a gut in golf
gear grins at the camera. Next to him a conservatively
dressed woman holds his trophy. Ruby looks closely.

RUBY
Is that you?

GERTRUDE
And that was Jack.

RUBY
So handsome.

GERTRUDE
Yes. And very serious. Like Calvin.

Gertrude touches Jack’s face with one finger, tenderly.

RUBY
He was a golfer?

GERTRUDE
Jack tried many, many things. It was hard
for him...to see things come so easily
for Calvin. He couldn’t understand. A
great gift can be a burden in its own
right. It can be lonely.

Ruby nods.

You know what.

Oh, grow up.

Stop! You’re hurting me.

CALVIN
Explain what you were doing.

RUBY
You left me alone at a party where I
didn’t know anyone. I found someone to
talk to.

CALVIN
In your underwear.

RUBY
Would you have been mad if I was wearing
my bikini?

CALVIN
You weren’t wearing your bikini. Do you
know how it looked? My agent was there.
My ex was there!

RUBY
Lila was there? Why didn’t you tell me?

CALVIN
Because I was too busy getting you to PUT
YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON. You’re supposed to
be my girlfriend.

RUBY
I am your girlfriend.

CALVIN
So act like it!

RUBY
I’m sorry I wasn’t acting like your
platonic ideal of a girlfriend. You can
be such a fucking prude.

CALVIN
Because I don’t want you skinny dipping
with other men?

RUBY
Because you don’t want me doing ANYTHING!
You have all these rules! And you don’t
tell me what they are until, whoops, I’ve
broken them! And then you get to be
disappointed with me!

CALVIN
You want to know my rules? Don’t fuck
other men! Don’t let them think about
fucking you!

RUBY
So I’m responsible for what other people
are thinking?

CALVIN
You are responsible! When you act a
certain way, it leads people on. If you
take your clothes off at a party, it
makes people think you’re a slut. So I'd
really prefer if you didn’t do that. Is
that clear enough for you?

RUBY
Fuck you. I am not your child. You
don’t get to decide what I do.

Ruby starts to put on her coat.

CALVIN
Wanna bet?

RUBY
What?!

CALVIN

I’m pretty sure I can make you do
whatever I want.

RUBY
What are you gonna do, tie me up?

CALVIN
Nope. I don’t have to.

Calvin leaves the room, casually. Ruby stares after him.
INT. CALVIN’S OFFICE. JUST AFTER. 116

Calvin takes the manuscript out of its drawer, puts the last
page in the typewriter. Ruby comes to the door.

RUBY
Calvin. I’m leaving. I will call you
tomorrow.

Calvin types something quickly.

CALVIN
Fine. Go.

Ruby shakes her head and turns to leave. She stops abruptly,

as if she’s hit a wall. She tries again. Again.

RUBY

Futile.

What...? What is this? What’s going on?

Calvin pulls the paper out of the typewriter and hands it to

her. She reads:

Ruby could not leave Calvin’s house. She couldn’t
his office.

Ruby looks up at Calvin, equal parts confusion and

What the fuck is this?

This is my book. The one I haven’t been
working on. Wanna see?

He hands her the previous page. She skims over it.

Is this some kind of joke?

No, it’s pretty serious.

We see

Ruby picks up other pages of the manuscript. Calvin watches

her. As she reads, the color drains from her face.

RUBY
What...what is this? You’re writing
about me? How did you know this, about
my teacher? Have you been talking to
people about me?

CALVIN
No.

RUBY
This is private. You can’t do this, you
can’t write about me.

CALVIN
I’m not writing about you. I wrote you.
I made you up.

RUBY
What?!

CALVIN
I had a dream about a girl. I wrote it
down. I gave her a name. Ruby. I wrote
all kinds of things about her. And one
day I woke up and she--you--were living
in my house. I can make you do anything.
Because you’re not real.

Ruby stares at him.

RUBY
You're sick. Jesus, you made me up?!
Let me tell you something, Calvin: you
are not the center of the fucking
universe. If this is how you think of
other people, then you are in for a long,
lonely, fucked up life.

He types something.

RUBY (CONT'D)
Je te jure, tu ferais mieux d’ecoutez ce
que j’ai... Mon Dieu. Je parle francais?
Mais, je ne sais pas parler francais.
Qu’est-ce-que--

[I swear to god, you better listen to
what I'm-- Oh my god. Am I speaking
French? I don't know how to speak
French! What--]

Calvin picks up a page, shows her:

CALVIN
“Ruby speaks French.”

RUBY
Mon Dieu! Qu’est-ce-qui m’arrive?
[Oh my god. What's happening? ]

I told you. I can make you do anything.

[What is this? How are you doing this?]

CALVIN
It’s simple. I write it.
(Types something)
You do it.

Ruby’s fingers start snapping. She stares at her hand as if
it doesn't belong to her.

RUBY

Mon Dieu! Arrete! Arrete!

[Oh my god, stop! Stop!]
Calvin types something. Ruby starts to sing and strip.
The song continues over as we see:
Calvin types, Ruby does. The hammers of the typewriter, the
violence of his fingers hitting the keys. Glimpses of the
words he writes and fast cuts of:

--Ruby spinning and chanting “I love you, I’1l never leave
you.”

--Ruby down on her knees, barking like a dog.

--Ruby dancing and yelling “I love your mouth, I love your
face, I love your cock,” etc.

--Ruby jumping up and down and cheering “You’re a genius!”
FINALLY:

Calvin slams his hands down on the keyboard, jamming the
letters. Ruby collapses. They are both shaking, silent.

After a long beat, Calvin raises his head, afraid to look at
her. Ruby is on the ground, barely breathing.

Calvin edges toward her, terrified. She doesn’t move. He
puts a tentative hand on her--and she JUMPS UP and runs out
of the room. We hear the door slam behind her.

Calvin is alone.

122 INT. CALVIN’S OFFICE. 122

A page sits, waiting, in the typewriter. Calvin thinks.
After a moment he sits forward and types something. He
removes the page. Reads what he’s written.

CALVIN (V.O.)
As soon as Ruby left the house, the past
released her. She was no longer Calvin's
creation. From that moment on, only Ruby
could determine the course her life. She
was free.

Calvin walks down the hall and places the manuscript in front
of the bedroom door. On the title page is a post-it note:

“Ruby. Look at the last page. I love you. Calvin.”

Calvin sits, leaning against the wall, waiting for Ruby to
open the door.

CUT TO:
122A OMITTED 122A
123 LATER. 123

CLOSE ON Calvin's face. Scotty’s nose enters frame. He
kisses Calvin vigorously. Calvin opens his eyes and sees:

The bedroom door is ajar. The manuscript sits on the floor,
but the Post-it note is gone.

124 INT. CALVIN'S BEDROOM. JUST AFTER. 124

The bedroom is stripped of Ruby’s things. Calvin goes to the
closet. Empty hangers where Ruby’s clothes were. Calvin
curls up on the floor and cries. Scotty lies next to him,
keeping him company.

The light fades rapidly, day to night until we are in
complete darkness. Then:

A light snaps on. Calvin is still lying on the floor.
Scotty sits there chewing a shoe. Feet walk over to Calvin.
Harry crouches down into frame.

CALVIN
She’s gone.

Harry helps Calvin to his feet and wraps his arms around his
brother in a long embrace.

Harry and Calvin sit across from each other at the kitchen

table.

Calvin eats soup. Harry watches him. Calvin stalls

for a moment.

HARRY
Soup.

Calvin takes another bite.

EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY.

Harry puts. Calvin stands there, in position to swing, but
does not move.

Silence.

CALVIN
Nothing helps.

Harry stops and looks at Calvin.

HARRY
When was the last time you wrote, Callie?

CALVIN
I can’t write.

HARRY
Sure you can. That’s what you have over
every other poor schmuck out there with a
broken heart. You can write about it.

CALVIN
Who would want to read that?

HARRY
Lots of people. Why not? You’ve got a
pretty cool story.

Calvin considers this.

CALVIN
Everyone will think I’m crazy.

HARRY
No. They'll think it’s fiction.

INT. CALVIN’S OFFICE. DAY.

CLOSE ON: the typewriter. Calvin’s hands enter frame, pick
it up and remove it. The empty desk. His hands reenter
frame and place a NEW BLACK MACBOOK in its place.

“One may read this and think it’s magic--
but falling in love is an act of magic.
So is writing.”

We see in the small crowd: Mort, Gertrude, Harry, and Susie.

CALVIN (CONT'D)
“It was once said of Cather in the Rye,
‘That rare miracle of fiction has again
come to pass: a human being has been
created out of ink, paper, and the
imagination.’ I am no J.D. Salinger, but
I have witnessed a rare miracle. Any
writer can attest, in the luckiest,
happiest state, the words are not coming
from you, but through you.”

Calvin pauses, looks around the room.
CALVIN (CONT'D)
“She came to me wholly herself. I was
just lucky enough to be there to catch
her.”
LATER.
Calvin talks with his family. Cyrus sidles up.

CYRUS
Where have you been? I’ve got people
dying to meet you.

CALVIN
Cyrus, you've met my family.

Calvin gestures toward Gertrude, Mort, Harry, and Susie.

HARRY
Hey dude.

Mort gives Cyrus a big hug. Cyrus looks discombobulated.

MORT
Doesn’t his imagination just blow you
away? I mean, where does he come up with
these things, right?

Calvin looks at Harry. Harry winks at him. Calvin smiles.
We pan out from our little group, enjoying the party.

That I imagined her. Or went crazy for a

But the thing is: I don’t need to make

It’s fine. He’s so friendly.

She pets Scotty. Calvin crouches down, searching her face,
his heart racing. It’s definitely her...isn’t it?
