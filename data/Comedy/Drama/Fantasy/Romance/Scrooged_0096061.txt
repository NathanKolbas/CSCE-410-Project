ESTABLISHING SHOT of Santa's Workshop -- a quaint
"gingerbread" cottage nestled in a serene, snow-covered
valley. Smoke curls from the chimney. MUSIC: Silent

WE MOVE CLOSER and isolate details: :
A candy-striped column marked "NORTH POLE."

Below the glistening, icicle-trimmed eave, silhouetted

on the shade of a frost-veiled window, ELVES put the

final touches on some toys -- tapping an extra nail,
adding that last dab of paint.

 

REINDEER nervously paw the ground, gently jangling their
sleighbells as they shake the snow from their antlers.

A rusty, old weathervane CREAKS in the breeze. All the

Cheeks fat with acorns, a CHIPMUNK scampers across the
| arrows are stamped "Ss."

 

In the sleigh sits a huge sack overflowing with gifts
which include toy drums, bisque dolls, teddybears.

Backlit by the full moon, a SNOWY OWL hoots softly and
shuts his eyes.

The sky sparkles with stars but one:shines brighter than
the rest. Is it a falling star? No, it's a flaming
mortar shell that screams into the cottage and explodes
in a teeth-jarring fireball of MULTIPLE BLASTS.

MUSIC changes to standard Tv action fare as a
gritty-voiced ANNOUNCER cuts in.

INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY 18

REVEAL that we have been watching a TV screen in an
office at IBC -- the International Broadcasting Company.

The lights come up. The same silver IBC logo is mounted
on the wall. A table is ringed with network EXECUTIVES.
At. one end of the table is the big TV monitor. At the
other end sits FRANK CROSS, president of IBC, who
presides over the meeting.

Frank is trim, polished and good-looking. At
thirty-eight, he is young for the powerful position he
holds. The press still calls him a "TV wonderkind."
Co-workers call him the "Smiling Viper."

MRS. GRACE COOLEY, his attractive black secretary, sits
near him taking notes.

This is a power office -- bleak, modern and immense. It
is on the 22nd floor with huge grid windows that look
down on New York City. It's designed to impress and
intimidate. There is futuristic design furniture, a wall
of TV monitors, a private bathroom, a small kitchen, a
bar. Above the ultra~modern desk hangs a Picasso from
his 1907-8 “African-Negro" period. The walls are
decorated with primitive masks, the closest thing Frank
has to a hobby. The massive desk is littered with
Scrooge miscellany -- drawings, models, posters,
swatches, etc.

No one speaks, waiting for Frank's reaction. There are
a few nervous coughs.

Finally Frank leans forward in the chair.

FRANK
It sucks.

EXECUTIVE 1

Yeah, something's missing...I
don't know. _

WAYNE, a smarmy sycophant, leaps on the bandwagon.

WAYNE
The Chuck Norris thing was way
over the top.

FRANK
Chuck Norris was fine.

know why.

He comes back inside and bolts the door. Immediately,
KNOCKING STARTS, loud and getting louder, cracking the
plaster, rocking the frame, denting the door itself.

The POUNDING STOPS.

FRANK
Who's there?!?

The door explodes off its hinges, sailing across the
room, The force of the blast knocks Frank to the floor.

Frank stumbles to his feet, bleeding from a cut on the
cheek. .

The room is a shambles. As the dust settles, WE SEE a
man standing in the smouldering doorway. Or what's left
of a man.

It's LEW WEXLER, Frank's ex-boss and mentor at IBC. He
wears rotting golf togs complete with checkered pants,
tasseled shoes and a robin's egg blue alpaca sweater, and
he drags a big, bulky golf bag crammed with clubs. Lew
is a decayed corpse, a Rick Baker nightmare with moss
growing on him and a mouse-hole in his forehead.

LEW
Hi, Frank. Do you mind if I help
Myself to a drink?

Swinging a rusted putter, Lew ambles across the room to
the bar and pours himself a Scotch. His golf shoes click
on the parquet.

Frank is not easily rattled. He opens a drawer and pulls
out a revolver. Holding the gun police-style with both
hands, he empties it into’ Lew's back. Five shots hit him
with a dull "thek!" kicking upa little dust. It's like
shooting an old pillow. The other shot shatters the
glass of Scotch. .

Frank drops the gun. Now he's rattled.
Lew raises his glass in a toast ...

LEW
To old times.

++. And downs it. The Scotch cascades out the holes in
his throat and forms a puddle at his feet.

Frank steps forward, recognizing him.

FRANK
Oh my God! It's...

LEW
Lew Wexler. Your old boss. And
your best friend.

FRANK
But you're dead!

LEW
For seven years.

Frank stalls as he moves across the room toward a red
“panic: Button" security alarm near the door.

FRANK
Has it-been seven years? Gosh,
looking at you, I.wouldn't say
more than. three, tops.

LEW
You're in big trouble, Frank.

Frank edges closer to the button. A WHITE MOUSE peeks
out of the hole on Lew's skull.

the burden off your shoulders.

Frank looks from Brice to Rhinelander, totally confused.

BRICE
A lot of men in your position
would see me a threat. It's only
natural ...

Stunned and speechless, Frank can only watch Brice babble
on. The CLOCK STRIKES one. Frank stiffens, remembering
Lew Wexler's warning.

LEW (V.O. WITH ECHO)
You'll be visited by three
ghosts. Expect the first at one

at a cartoonish MIKE THE MAILMAN who wears an
exaggerated, corny mailman suit, bow tie and carries an
over-size mail pouch. WE ARE WATCHING a children's TV

The dog chews Mike's pant-leg, growling in front of a
whimsical dog house hand-lettered -- "KIDDIE KENNEL".

Let go of my leg! I've got
something in my mail bag for ya.

The dog still clings to his leg.

Mike pulls out a big, bone-shaped object wrapped in
Christmas paper with a red bow. A tag reads "MERRY

Frank looks at the Ghost who simply points towards the

He looks up at the floor lights. The car is still. He's
breathing hard. Suddenly with a wrenching metallic
sound, the walls of the elevator begin to close in on
him. The ceiling slowly drops. Frank jams his arms out,
trying to fight it, but the elevator tightens to fit his
body. The lights flicker and, in the instant before they
go out, WE SEE that the elevator car has become Frank's
coffin! .

From outside WE HEAR hands roughly grab the coffin and
turn it sideways.

Church bells RING loudly on the TV monitor above him.

Frank stops thrashing. He looks around, recognizing that
he's back safe on the 22nd floor. As the reality hits,
a big smile spreads across his face. He bounds to his
feet. He giggles, laughing louder, finally shouting with

joy.

FRANK

Eliot steps from around the corner, aiming a shotgun
squarely at Frank.

Not for long.

Frank brushes the gun aside and throws a brotherly arm
around Eliot..

Eliot climbs from behind the desk.
