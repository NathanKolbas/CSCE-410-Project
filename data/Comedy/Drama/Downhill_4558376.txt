IN BLACK:
The distant sound of a car engine, revving intermittently.

FADE IN:

EXT. AUTO-ROUTE - DAY

LOCKED FRAME of a road winding its way, side to side, up a
steep, snow-covered wall of the Alps. Eventually, a black
Mercedes SUV breaks the bottom of FRAME, ascending.

INT. SUV - DAY

At the wheel, PETE STANTON, confidently shifting gears.
Riding shotgun, his wife, BILLIE. She’s busy in her phone.
Their twin sons, EMERSON and FINN (10), are in the back. Finn
is focused on the scenery. Em is buried in a book. Yep. An
actual book. Pete takes a hard curve, dropping into the wrong
gear.

BILLIE
(amused)
We got it, Pete. You’re a man. Slow
down.

PETE
This is how they drive.

BILLIE
You’re not “they.”

PETE
There’s no speed limit here.

BILLIE
That’s Germany. This is Austria.

PETE
It’s the Autobahn.

This is a couple who love to give each other shit. It makes
things work.

BILLIE
(on phone)
Tell you what, I’11 look it up.

PETE
I looked it up. I read it.

*
JA 1st 2.

BILLIE
(calling bluff)
Great. Now, I’1l read it.

Pete concedes. Slows down.
PETE
I just want to get out on the
mountain.
BILLIE
(amused)
I’m very aware of what you want.

He glances in the rearview mirror.

PETE
Em, you’re missing it, buddy.

Em looks up, gets a quick glance, and returns to his book.
FINN

(off incline)
Are we going to ski this?

PETE
Maybe.
BILLIE
What? No. Why would you say...?
PETE BILLIE
I’m saying there will be He said “this.” Will we ski
steep stuff... “this?”
PETE
He knows what I meant...
FINN
(to Em)

We're going to ski this.
Em doesn’t even look up from his book. He could care less.

PETE
Like this, buddy. Like this.

Pete gives a playful “Oops” look.

BILLIE
Be. Clear.

She glances out the window.
JA 1st 3.

BILLIE’S POV of a passing sign/billboard for “Ischgl Ski
Resort.” A mixture of German and English, but their slogan is
undeniable: “Relax. If You Can...”

BACK TO SCENE, as...

BILLIE (CONT'D)
(scoffing, amused)
Kind of feels like a threat...

Just then, a LARGE BUS rounds the bend in Pete’s lane. Pete
slams the brakes. Everyone freaks a bit. The BUS DRIVER,
clearly annoyed, HONKS.

PETE
-+. Am I on the wrong side?

BILLIE
This is the side we've been on.
We've always been on this side...

The Bus Driver HONKS, again, and waves Peter to back up.

PETE
He wants me to back up.

BILLIE
You can’t back up.

PETE
Am I on the wrong side?

BILLIE
Have him back up.
(to Driver)
You back up. You back up.

PETE
It’s a bus. He can’t back up.

BILLIE
Buses can back up.

PETE
Am I in the wrong...?

BILLIE
Just go around.

Peter navigates to the other lane, BUT NOPE - there’s a
number of cars trailing the Bus in that lane.

PETE
Do we even get a lane?
JA 1st 4.

HONK. The Bus Driver waves Peter back, even more insistent.
In fact, he drives FORWARD.

PETE (CONT'D)
He’s coming at us.

BILLIE PETE
Okay, back up. Yeah, we have to back up.

Back to our LOCKED FRAME from the opening, as Pete slowly
backs up and the bus inches forward. It’s a long, awkward
process. Superimposed over this image, our title:

“DOWNHILL”

EXT. SKI MOUNTAIN - DAY

A still photo of our family: Twins center, flanked by Billie
and Peter. Mountains in the background, sun in their faces.

Snow blows across, the family shuffle. It’s not a still, it’s

live action.
PHOTOGRAPHER (0.S.)
Danke! Danke schon! Thank you -
yes. Ja. Next one.

The family moves around to pose for a series of photos. The

poised classical framing is all wonky. We struggle to see our

family, to focus on individuals, as Peter and Billie arrange
themselves and their kids until:

PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Jetzt mache schneeballe und wirf
sie. Ja?

Billie looks nonplussed. Peter doesn’t get it, either. But
then the photographer makes a snowball and they understand.

As other families pass by, we see the Stantons through their
eyes: looking good. Cavorting for the cameras and for each
other. Peter rough-housing the laughing boys, with just a
hint of an eye on the camera. Click click click.

PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
Wunderbar!

Happy days. Good times.

EXT. MOUNTAINS/SLOPES - DAY

Sun plays across the snow. The peaks are beautiful, but
terrifyingly, overwhelmingly massive.

 %
JA 1st 5.

Closer in: A blank white screen of snow. Billie, Pete, and
the Twins come down the mountain. All decent skiers, carving
long S shapes. They make a pretty pattern as they slip in-
between one another. A family in sync.

EXT. MID-MOUNTAIN - DAY

Peter and Billie stop. They breathe and just take in that
first run. Below them, the Austrian resort.

PETER
(facetious)
Wow. That was not too shitty.

BILLIE
Yeah, right? Better than I
imagined.

Billie glances at her boot, shaking it out a bit, as the
Twins arrive by their sides. Finn, all smiles. Emerson kicks
snow off his skis.

PETER
How about that, huh?
FINN
Awesome.
Em doesn’t pipe up.
BILLIE

Em? Pretty cool, huh?
EMERSON
(going along)
Uh-huh? Sure.

PETER
“Sure?” It’s more than “sure.”

Peter nudges/play-punches Emerson until he cracks a smile.

PETER (CONT'D)
Alright, everyone follow me.

BILLIE
Yeah, keep an eye on daddy.

PETER
We good?

Billie is back with her boot, shaking it.
JA 1st 6.

BILLIE
Yeah, let me just...

But, Pete is already off down the mountain. The Twins follow. *
As Billie scrambles a bit to gather herself and “catch up,”
We...

INT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - DAY

Peter and the Twins are gathered around a terminal where the
photos taken up at the top of the mountain can be viewed.
They point, laugh and argue over which ones to ‘tick’ and
print out.

Billie sits with a young SKI RENTAL KID, considering her
boot.

BILLIE
I think they're good. I just felt
that they might be a little tight *
here? It’s a little tight here but *

felt kind of loose there?

ON YOUNG SNOWBOARDER bursting in from outside, letting out a
piercing WHISTLE to get the Ski Rental Kid’s attention. *
Clearly, the Snowboarder wants to hit the mountain and is
getting impatient. A slightly heated German exchange for

which we receive no subtitles. Billie coughs to get the
attention back.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
So, here it’s tight. But, there *
it’s loose. Is that good? *

The Kid gives a cursory, meaningless touch of the boot.

SKI RENTAL KID
Is good.

Peter approaches.

PETER
She just felt a little sliding of
the foot and a little, too much
grip on the ankle.

SKI RENTAL KID
Is good.

PETER
Is good?
JA 1st 7.

SKI RENTAL KID

Is good.
PETER
(to Billie)
Is good?
BILLIE
Is good?
Billie considers.
PETER
(to the Kid)

We all got moulded boots but she
decided hers weren’t right, so?

BILLIE
I mean, they’re tight? Maybe I have
weird feet?
(conceding)
No. Good. Yeah?

Peter nods. Yes. Enough.

E/I. HOTEL - DAY

The family approach the front entrance. A whirlwind of
activity as the ski day comes to a close. SKIERS whisk by,
taking advantage of the “ski in/ski out.”

The family enters the...
LOBBY.

Billie clocks the GREGARIOUS GROUPS (all adults) passing
them, heading out towards town, beers/cocktails in hand. The
whole lobby is a madhouse. SKIERS/GUESTS of all nationalities
mill about, gather at the bar, etc.. A cacophony of different
languages echo throughout the space. The Twins take off
running.

BILLIE
(calling after)
Stay where I can see you.

DING! From Pete’s phone. A text. He checks.

BILLIE (CONT'D)

(to Pete)
Have you noticed there are no other
kids? Seems weird, right?
JA 1st 8.

PETE
(shrugging, lost in phone)
School schedules are different?

Billie hands an ATTENDANT a ticket for their luggage at
BAGGAGE CHECK. They had left them there in the urgency to get
on the mountain.

BILLIE
Still. You'd see some kids.

EMERSON/FINN (0.S.)
Mom!

ON TWINS, by a table decked out with an array of sweets and
coffee. They are pleading to “dive in,” hands in “prayer
mode.”

BILLIE
One thing each.

They scoop up two things each and immediately take a bite.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
I said one.

Deer in headlights. Both put the “bitten choices” back.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
No, don’t... Take them back.

They do. Again, deer. Now, what?

BILLIE (CONT'D)
Now, put the uneaten ones back.

Still deer.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
Okay. You get two. Two.

They take off running. Billie notices Pete, still in phone.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
Who are you texting?

PETE
It’s Zach. He and Rosie are in
Amsterdam, apparently.

ON PHONE SCREEN. “HIGH from Amsterdam!” There’s a series of
selfies of ZACH and ROSIE, a very youthful and free-spirited
couple. They are sporting backpacks.
JA 1st

BILLIE
And, they’re backpacking?

PETE
Yeah, travelling wherever. No real
agenda. See, I know this because it
says right here.

ON SCREEN. Below the photos, more text: "#NoAgenda

#LiveYourBestLife”

PETE (CONT'D)
(reading jokingly)

Hashtag no agenda. Hashtag live

your best life.

BILLIE
Hashtag get better hashtags.

They both laugh. The ATTENDANT brings out their bags.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
Okay, let’s not be in our phones.

PETE
No, totally. I’m just finishing it.

BILLIE
This is a family vacation, so let’s
be here. Not texting. Playing

 

games...

PETE
Absolutely. He texted me. I’m
just... I mean, you’ve been on your
phone...

If ever Billie gets adamant, it is with this.

BILLIE
Yeah. To deal with work stuff. And,
family stuff. I’m doing both.

PETE
No, totally...

BILLIE
And, now I’m done and I’m here.

PETE
I’m done, too. Great.

Pete puts away his phone. They nod to one another and

quick kiss. All good.

JA 1st 10.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Pete and Billie approach RECEPTION as a group of MIDDLE-AGED
GUYS on a men-only weekend are laughing/flirting with the
FEMALE RECEPTIONIST. The GUYS depart, laughing. The
receptionist is momentarily called away.

CHARLOTTE (50s), a worldly Scandinavian woman, approaches. *
She has packets of documents under her arm and an air of

someone very happy. (NOTE: She’s on the same side of the

counter as Billie/Pete.)

CHARLOTTE
Hello. I’m Charlotte. So. The
flight was okay? What time did you
check in?

BILLIE
Oh, uh, hi. Midday. Yes. All good.

PETE *
I wanted us to get right out on the

mountain.

*

Billie and Peter, confused by Charlotte’s role, glance back
in the direction of where the Receptionist had been. *

CHARLOTTE
Well, sorry I wasn’t there to meet
you. Now, what the fuck have I got
for you?

Billie and Peter clock one another. However, there’s little
time to process as Charlotte is a whirlwind of peculiarities.
She gives them envelopes, key cards and maps. *

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Okay. Resort map. Key cards. Um,
ski passes you got, right? *
With the pack? *

Finn and Emerson run up, grabbing onto Billie. She settles
them.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Well, hello, handsome ones.

BILLIE
This is Finn and Emerson. Our sons.

CHARLOTTE
Hello tiny men, yes?
JA 1st 11.

BILLIE
So, I’m curious. Are there more
kids around?

CHARLOTTE
Oh yes. Many.

Pete glances at Billie: “See?”

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Not here. The town of Fiss-- Maybe,
minutes of 20 from here-- Yes,
there is all families.

Billie looks at Pete: “Did you know this?” But, Pete shrugs
and shakes his head. It seems genuine, at least.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
But, here better, yes? Is lively.
The Ibiza of the Alps. Ski hard.
Then, party as hardest. Yes?

But, she offers no time for them to answer or process...

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Yes! Okay. Now. Restaurant
recommendations. Around the centre
you will find quite fine dining,
quite upmarket. And in the sauna.

She pronounces it Scandinavian style ‘sow-nah’.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
In Europe it’s considered
unhygienic to sauna in your swim
suits. So, please, the body is not
to be ashamed of, yes?

BILLIE
Well, speak for yourself.

CHARLOTTE
(dead serious)
No. Your body is good. Celebrate
it.
(nod to Pete)
Both.

Charlotte stays locked on them, waiting for confirmation.
PETE BILLIE

«.. Thank you. No, yeah. Celebrate. Thank
you.
JA 1st 12.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
(pleased, back to
business)
For your skiing, there are the easy
runs on the Austrian side. Over the
other, if you like, you can go
crazy in Switzerland.

BILLIE
Switzerland?

CHARLOTTE
Over the top is Switzerland and
everything is different. And so any
questions?

Maybe they do, but Charlotte doesn’t wait for them...

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Okay, so. We are finished. I’m here
as friend, yes? Do you want to be
my friend?

The slightly odd phrasing and European directness throws them
off. She holds their gaze.

PETE BILLIE
Um-— ++. Yes?

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Good. Then, we are friends.

Charlotte laughs. So, naturally Billie and Peter laugh.
Charlotte gives them her card.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Please call me. You are American.
You have paid, so you must have
everything!

As they make “good-byes,” Billie and Peter fumble with their
bags. They speak in hushed tones during the following:

BILLIE
Should you tip her?

PETE
I don’t - Who the fuck is she?

Peter presses a 20 Euro note into Charlotte’s hand. It wasn’t
quite expected. It’s hard to understand her expression:

BILLIE
Nope. You weren’t supposed to.
JA 1st 13.

PETE
Is she offended?

BILLIE
I don’t know...

PETE
Take it back?

BILLIE
No, you can’t...

PETE
Maybe, it wasn’t enough?

BILLIE
No, don’t add...

But, he does add tip. Charlotte is still hard to read,
staring.

PETE
She’s still there.

BILLIE
So, let’s not be, anymore.

They start off with their bags.

CHARLOTTE
No, silly friends. We bring bags.
You do nothing!

BILLIE
No, yes. Of course. That’s what we
were just discussing.
(can’t get away fast
enough)
Okay.

As they shuttle to the elevator,...

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Billie through the nice spacious arrangement,
complete with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a common area
with a full kitchen and dining table.

She passes the Twins’ room. They are tossing clothes out of
their bags, haphazardly.
JA 1st 14.

BILLIE
All that stuff in drawers, please.
And, hang up your ski stuff to dry.

We continue with Billie into...
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
Them sharing a queen will be a
disaster...

ON PETE, immediately tossing his phone on the bed as if it’s
on fire. Clearly, he was on it.

PETE
Now, I’m done.

Billie just playfully slaps his ass. They start to unpack.

PETE (CONT'D)
Zach kept texting. Asking questions
about Ischgl. Wondering where we
were staying...

BILLIE
We're not looking for them to “No
agenda” their way here, are we?

PETE
No, no, no. That’s why I was
finishing the conversation. No. I
see him enough at work.

Billie nods, “Good.” Pete pulls a vintage-looking, knit ski
hat out of his bag. Tad tacky. Very old school.

PETE (CONT'D)
Look. I found my Dad’s old hat.
Thought I'd bring it. Wear it on
the slopes. Have him here with me.

The moment catches Pete off guard. A little swell of emotion.
She rubs his back.

BILLIE
I love that.

She kisses him.

PETE
Sorry, if I’ve been...
JA 1st 15.
BILLIE
It’s okay.
She pats his heart.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
That’s why we’re here.

FINN (0.S.)
Dad! Come look!

Pete collects himself.

FINN/EMERSON (0.S.)

Dad!
PETE
I heard “Mom.”
BILLIE
(amused)

I know you did.

She pushes him toward the door, as we...

INT. BATHROOM/COMMON AREA - DAY
CLOSE ON a BIDET.
REVEAL Em, Finn and Pete hovered around it.

FINN
What is it?

PETE
It’s European.

EMERSON
What’s it for?

PETE
.+. For washing.

ON BILLIE, in COMMON AREA. She’s stacking and laying out ski
clothes for everyone for the next day.

EMERSON (0.S.)
For washing, what?

Curious, Billie approaches the bathroom door, as Pete
continue to struggle with what to say.
JA 1st 16.

PETE
For washing your, uh...
BILLIE
Feet. But, let’s not use it for
that. Or, anything. *

Billie nods toward Pete to follow her. He complies as they
get a safe distance from the twins.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
If we tell them what it’s really
for, we'll never get them off of
it.

PETE
So,... Don't be clear.

Pete smirks, giving her shit. Billie’s not connecting the
dots from the previous conversation.

PETE (CONT'D)
Here, we don’t be clear.

Now, she’s “up to speed.”

BILLIE
Yes. Because there will be hijinx.
PETE
So, don’t be clear when there’s a *

possibility of hijinx.

*

Billie swats him away and walks off as...

PETE (CONT’D) *
(as if committing to *

memory ) *

No chance of hijinx means full *

clarity. Chance of hijinx, lie. *

INT. HOTEL ROOM, MASTER - NIGHT *

Pete and Billie are on their bed, watching TV. There is a
tray with leftover room service between them. They pick at
the scraps which is mostly just fries and wine.

PETER
Okay, we should stop, yes?

BILLIE
Yes.
JA 1st 17.

Yet, they each take more fries.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
Okay, stop. We’re going to want to
eat a big breakfast.
Pete complies, pushing the tray away.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
I’m going to grab a shower.

PETER
I’m going to want to get out first
thing....

As she heads into the BATHROOM,...

BILLIE
I know you will.
PETER
Just so we account for that big

breakfast.

Off screen, the SHOWER starts. Now safe, Pete pulls a handful
of fries and downs them with great speed. He considers,
clears the fry debris with his tongue, takes a gulp of water
and heads into the bathroom.

CAMERA HOLDS outside during the following:
We HEAR the shower door, opening.
BILLIE (0.S.)
(half laughing/half
adamant)
.-. No. We’re not doing it in here.

PETE (0.S.)
It will be fast.

BILLIE (0.S.)
It never works.

PETE (0.S.)
There’s a bench...

BILLIE (0.S.)
No. Pete. This is my time...

Clearly, Pete is teasing and grabbing at her trying to win
her over. It works:
JA 1st 18.

BILLIE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Okay, we can do a quickie on the
bed when I’m out.

During the following, CAMERA slowly dollies back and PANS to
the bedroom window.

BILLIE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
But, go figure out what we’ll watch *
on TV afterwards. I don’t want you

sitting there and scrolling around

for half an hour....

CAMERA lands on the window and PUSHES IN. In the distance,
bright, white lights illuminate the mountain. Three SNOWCATS
ascend the slopes, grooming. We RACK FOCUS into the window,
giving us the reflection of Pete turning on the TV and
scrolling for show options.

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK *
SKI DAY 2 *
INT. HOTEL ROOM, MASTER - THE NEXT MORNING *

Billie and Pete are in bed, dead sleep. An alarm goes off.
QUICK CUTS OF:

- Pete slamming the alarm off.

- Pete and Billie swing out of bed. Second day excitement.

- The curtains part. Early dawn frames the dazzling, white
vista. *

- Billie and Pete grab their stacks of ski clothes. Em grabs
his, somewhat unenthusiastically. And Finn? He’s already at
the door, dressed to go.

- BATHROOM. Despite back-to-back dual sinks, with a two-sided *
mirror dividing them, Billie and Pete choose to share the *
space, brushing their teeth on the same side. *

- Billie tapes identifiable stickers to all the helmets. Pete *

passes by, carrying his dad’s knit hat. *
BILLIE
(re: stickers, "good idea, *
huh?”)
So, we don’t lose each other. *

*

(noticing dad's hat)
Under your helmet, yes? *
JA 1st 19.

PETE
No, yeah. For under.

- Pete puts on his dad’s knit hat, and then attempts to add
his helmet. Clearly, it’s not going to work. A bit bummed, he
goes with just the helmet.

EXT. SKI LIFT - DAY

Our first real taste of the madhouse that is the lift line.
It’s hovering just between order and chaos. Our family
navigates and attempts to figure out “how the system
operates.” Pete powers ahead, confident that he can figure it
out. Billie keeping tabs on the boys.

LATER - They are just shy of the front of the lift line. A
LIFT ATTENDANT is there checking everyone gets on safely. He
chunters away in German as people pass.

Before our family, there’s a GROUP OF THREE. The Lift
Attendant calls for someone from the SINGLES LINE to join
them to make it four. The SINGLE GUY scoots up past Pete. He
can’t help but notice that the Guy is skiing in a knit hat.
Old school. In fact, there’s a fair number of “non helmet”
skiers.

It’s the family’s turn. The scoot into position. As Billie
and Peter pass the Lift Attendant, he raps his knuckles on
their helmets.

LIFT ATTENDANT
Helme fiir die Kinder! Helme fiir die
Kinder!

Pete and Billie don’t know what to make of what he said.
(NOTE: We won’t get subtitles on this. Or, at all,
throughout.) Billie and Pete assume, incorrectly...

BILLIE
I think he just wants to know that
they’re on secure?

PETE
(knocking, cheery)
All good!
EXT. PISTE - DAY

The family descends. Not as compact as “day one.” Finn is out
in front, eager to show his parents what he can do.

*
JA 1st 20.

PETE
(calling out)
Slow up, Finn!

But, he doesn’t hear. He just keeps plowing ahead. Pete
pursues. Billie hangs back with Em, who makes a more
tentative descent.

EXT. SKI RESTAURANT - DAY
Finn stops just outside the agreed restaurant. Pete arrives.

PETE
We need to stick with the group.
Alright, buddy?

Finn nods. Pete pats Finn’s helmet. They both look up the
slope at Billie making wide curves ahead of an increasingly
slow Emerson.

Finally, Billie and Em join them. Finn looks at his brother
like: come on man, stop hamming it up. Emerson makes a fuck-
you face.

Billie raises her eyebrows at Peter, meaning: Jesus he took
his time.

As they start to unclip their boots, we...

EXT. SKI RESTAURANT - DAY

An outside terrace. Blue sky. Waiters come and go. The family
are looking at menus.

BILLIE
I’m thinking... How about if we
just have soup? Then, we can have
pastries at four and also be hungry
for a dinner? Is that a plan?

Peter is looking at a piste map.

PETER
Should we do this black after
lunch?

FINN

I’1l do that Dad.

BILLIE
Umm?
JA 1st 21.

Peter takes her lack of engagement as skepticism.

PETER
Oh, I don’t think it will be that
challening. It looks black, but
skis red. American blue. Several of
these blacks are really American
blues - European reds - but they
want them to be black for the
glamour?

Billie looks at the map.

BILLIE
Unless... Should we go find some
good powder? Get in some practice
in case we want to blow it out and

go for a--
She mimes ‘helicopter’ - not well. Rotors over her head --
PETER
Rodeo?

Off on the opposite hillside: a loud BANG! BANG!

Everyone on the terrace looks over to the mountain side. A
controlled explosion rumbles.

BILLIE
Whoa. Look at ...

PETER
Okay!

And, on a distant piste, an avalanche starts to roll. A low
rumble that soon grows, exponentially. The mass of snow
builds. It’s A BIG AVALANCHE. Suddenly, snow is filling the
whole valley.

BILLIE
Is that okay?

Peter, the man of the world, smiles but it’s billowing and
ADVANCING FAST. PANIC RISES. There’s a scream on the
restaurant terrace. It’s that moment when NORMALITY FADES and
you have to judge whether this is a life or death scenario.

THE AVALANCHE is going to be upon them in a second -- What
the fuck?!

Billie PUTS HER ARM AROUND the kids. Cries out in FEAR.
JA 1st 22.

Without time to think Peter STANDS, and FUMBLES A RETREAT. He
grabs his phone and STUMBLES FAST out of the shot just as
people SCREAM and the terrace is TOTALLY ENVELOPED IN SNOW.

SILENCE.
EVERYTHING IS WHITE.
Then:

BILLIE (CONT'D)
Pete!

FINN/EM
Dad!!

Confusion and PANIC reign. Muted shouts and screams. Then -
after the moment of maximum noise and panic, the shouts calm
down. And SLOWLY, the snow starts to settle. It was just a
plume of SLOWLY SETTLING POWDER. Not a mass of snow.

Everyone begins to realize that this was not a life or death
moment. There are even a couple of muffled LAUGHS, mild
mannered exclamations. The Waiters and Waitresses move into
action, to clear the DUSTING OF SNOW from the tables.

BILLIE
Are you okay? Kids? Are you okay?
EMERSON
Yep.
FINN
Yes.
BILLIE

We're okay. We’re okay.
Then, clomping back in his ski boots, comes Peter.

PETER
Whoa.

The family are silent. They look at him. He rejoins them.

PETER (CONT'D)
Wow. Huh?

Billie doesn’t know what to say.

BILLIE
Uh-huh.
JA 1st 23.

PETER
Are you all okay?

They nod, mutely.

PETER (CONT'D)
That was -- wasn’t it?

BILLIE
«+. Yeah.

More silence. Finally, a Waitress comes to their table to
dust off the snow.

PETER
Okay. Here we go.

Pete has an air of “back to normal.” Almost defiantly “not
fazed.”

PETE
So, we're all doing soup?

The kids and Billie look at him. He’s claiming it’s all over.

EXT. SLOPES - DAY

The family are out skiing again. Peter at the front. He
carves off ahead, unaware or unconcerned that behind him
Billie and the kids hang back.

Even Finn is taking it easy. He looks behind him for Emerson,
who looks behind him for Billie, who looks behind herself at
the mountain to assure that everything is safe. Just then, a
YOUNG SKIER flies past them all at full speed. They flinch.

INT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - DAY

The family is putting their gear away for the day in lockers
and racks. The atmosphere is chaotic as many SKIERS jostle to
do the same.

At one end of the shop are a series of floor-to-ceiling
movable racks for boots on runners. The racks can be shifted,
and different aisles created, to get to the boots.

Emerson is dawdling in one of the aisles, as he looks for the
spot to put his boots. A DUTCH SKIER on the next aisle pushes
the racks along their rails unaware that Emerson is in the
next aisle looking the other way. The big metal unit nears
his back --

JA 1st 24.

ON PETER, nearby, noticing.

PETER
Hey?

The Dutch Skier doesn’t hear, slides on. *

PETER (CONT'D)
Hey! Hey! Stop!

ON BILLIE, across the room, pulling off her boots. She looks
up as, Pete rushes over to put his hand up against the rack. *

PETER (CONT'D)
Watch what you're doing!

The Dutch Skier steps out. *

DUTCH SKIIER
Ontspannen. Ontspannen.
(what? )
Okay? Cool, yeah? Everything's
cool. *

PETE
It’s not cool. You could have
crushed my son?

Pete’s reaction to this feels a bit heightened.
Overcompensating?

PETE (CONT'D)
(to Em)
You alright?

EMERSON
Yeah.

The Dutch Skiier touches the big set of racks with a finger.

DUTCH SKIIER
They stop easy, yeah?

Billie has arrives, puts her attention on Em, too.

BILLIE
You okay?

EMERSON
Yeah, I'm fine.

PETE
This guy wasn’t looking. But, I *
took care of it. *
(MORE )
JA 1st 25.

PETE (CONT'D)
(then to Skier)
I don’t want trouble.

*

The Dutch Skier doesn’t either. He’s still not sure what all
the fuss was about. *

DUTCH SKIIER
Yes. I don’t... *

Billie watches as Pete shuttles Em away, consoling. She’s
still lost in this residual fog: What happened? Where was *
this Pete on the mountain? Does she believe this Pete? *

INT. HOTEL SUITE, COMMON AREA - NIGHT

The Twins are on the couch, dressed for bedtime, watching
television. It’s The Loud House or Spongebob Squarepants.
(Basically, whatever is popular for boys and is “cleared.”)
That said, it’s all in German with no subtitles. The Twins
don’t seem to mind.

INT. HOTEL SUITE, BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Billie stands at the dual sink, finishing her make-up. She’s
quite dressed up and very much still playing back the day in *
her head. Pete enters. *

PETE
You look pretty.

He kisses her neck.

BILLIE
«.. Thank you.

Pete reaches over her to grab his toothbrush. Billie zigs

when she should have zagged. The “ballet” at the sink before

is “out of sync” here. Eventually, Pete gets his toothpaste

and begins brushing. They stay on the same side of the sink
despite the “vibe.” Billie takes a moment. It’s clear she *
wants to ask about today. But, just as she opens her mouth... *

EMERSON (0.S.)
Stop!

FINN (0.S.)
Give it to me!

EMERSON (0.S.)
No!
JA 1st 26.

Pete heeds the call and heads out to investigate. He might
have welcomed it. From the other room, Pete and the boys:

FINN (0.S.)
He won’t give me the remote.

EMERSON (0.S.)
It’s my turn to choose.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - A LITTLE LATER

Pete is scrolling movie options on the television, while
Billie preps the twins. She’s holding the cordless hotel
phone.

BILLIE
Okay, this is the phone. You can
call us at any point from this on
our cell phones. Numbers are here.
Okay? They work. We checked.

OFF SCREEN, a soft KNOCK at the door. Pete heads to answer.
[During the following, we’ll hear the faint sound of Pete
conversing with Room Service. ]

BILLIE (CONT'D)

(lays out a piece of

paper)
Or, call reception. Or, the
restaurant. Or, one of you can even
come down. We’re right downstairs
at the restaurant off the lobby.
You saw where that was, remember?

Pete returns with a tray, complete with TWO covered plates.

PETE
Mom ordered a couple burgers and
fries. How cool is that? And, they
have movies in English. So, we can
pick one of those.

The boys seems a little wary. Perhaps residual feelings from
today.

BILLIE
And, we'll be back by the time the
movie ends to tuck you in, okay?

She smiles. As does Pete. The boys seem consoled.
JA 1st 27.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Billie and Peter walk down to dinner. Glances exchanged.
Smiles, flashed. Billie grapples. A need to start a talk.
Just as she’s about to speak--

An enthusiastic ITALIAN COUPLE exit their room up ahead, mid-
conversation. They continue down the corridor just ahead of
Billie and Peter.

Peter lets the back of his hand brush Billie’s. He offers a
hand-hold. Billie doesn’t take it right away, but eventually
gives in and they walk interlinked.

The Italian Couple peels off down a different corridor. Back
to silence. Billie lets her hand go passive, letting Pete’s
fingers ride interlinked with hers, but with no grip between
them. They slip away.

INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Peter and Billie are waiting to be seated. She glances at
Pete, a desire to start. Pete stays focused ahead. He feels
her gaze but chooses to be oblivious.

BILLIE
wee SOpeee

CHARLOTTE (0.S.)
Yay! My good friends! Yes!

ON CHARLOTTE in a banquette, waving. Her dinner companion,
CHARLIE, a slightly older British fellow, is excusing himself
to the restroom.

ON BILLIE/PETE, waving back.
PETE
(aside)
I think she wants us to...
BILLIE
(aside)
She's just waving...

Charlotte’s wave becomes a “waving over.” She gestures for
them to “join.”

BILLIE (CONT'D)
Let’s just make an excuse...

There’s NO WAY she heard that, but...
JA 1st 28.

CHARLOTTE
(calling over)
There is no reason I take!

Off Pete, giving a “What are we going to do?” to Billie,
We...

INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER

Peter and Billie are opposite Charlotte. A WAITER delivers
“first” drinks for Billie and Pete and “another round” for
Charlotte and her companion (still in bathroom. )

CHARLOTTE
(to Waiter)
And, bring another for my friends.

BILLIE PETE
Oh, I’m not sure I’ll... Yeah, I’m good for...

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
No smart to get now. Bar is crazy.
The Ibiza of the Alps, yes?

The Waiter heads off.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
I drink if you not. Going to clubs.

Charlotte does a small “dance groove.” Pete attempts to fish
out her precise role.

PETE
That's nice. So, a night off from--
(off Charlotte, not
clicking in)
Do you find you get enough time off
from your duties as a... ?

But, still no such luck--
CHARLOTTE
Oh sure. Enough to catch a dick
whenever I want!

Billie swallows with a gulp.

PETER BILLIE
That's... great. +.. Time is nice.

Charlie returns to the table. He slides next to Charlotte.
JA 1st 29.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
(introducing)
Charlie, this is Billie and Pete.
(then)
I was just talking about you?

CHARLIE
All good, I hope?
BILLIE
(with meaning)
Uh-huh, sure.

Charlie is gossipy and pally.

CHARLIE
What did she say?

BILLIE
Oh. Um?

CHARLOTTE

I said I can always catch a dick
when I like.

She smiles. Playful. But he’s not quite up to the challenge
of being so comic-casual about their liaison.

CHARLIE
Oh. Oh, right?

Charlie takes a swig of his drink. Smiles.

CHARLOTTE
Yeah?

CHARLIE
I mean. Okay, I just thought --

CHARLOTTE
I was kidding!
(off his slightly hurt
look)
Why, you think we're getting
married?

CHARLIE
No! God. No.
(beat, then)
I just thought. I had a nice time
today? This afternoon?

CHARLOTTE
Uh-huh.
JA 1st 30.

Charlie looks at her - aren’t you going to give me more?
Weird beat. Pete tries to break it...

PETER
And, you two know each other
from...?

CHARLIE

Here. I got in on Sunday? She
showed me around.

CHARLOTTE
Yeah, but you’re a quick learner.

Charlotte licks her lips. Charlie smiles, flattered but also
discombobulated. The Waiter returns for more drinks, loading
up Billie and Pete. He starts to offer menus, but...

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
No, I order for table. You’1l love.
(to Waiter)
You know what I’d say. All that and
bread. Yes?

The Waiter does know what she'd order and walks off.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
(to Billie/Pete)
So, what do you do?

BILLIE
Well, I’m a lawyer. Trademark law.
(joking)
So, yeah. Riveting.

CHARLOTTE
(dead serious)
No.

Billie is thrown.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Love it. Or, no do it.

BILLIE
Oh, no. I love it. For me. Yes.

Charlotte smiles. “Good.” She looks at Pete, cueing up.

PETE
I’m in real estate.
(then, quickly)
And, I love it.
JA 1st 31.

CHARLOTTE
And you guys have a good day on the
mountain?

PETER
(diving in)
Great day. Great conditions. Real
alpine experience.

Billie can’t let that fly--

BILLIE
I mean, we almost all died in an
avalanche but... Yeah, great.
CHARLOTTE
What?
PETER

("don’t exaggerate”)
Come on, Billie...

(to Charlotte/Charlie)
There was a moment...

BILLIE
There was an avalanche.
CHARLIE CHARLOTTE
Good Lord. Good fuck. Were you okay?
PETER

There was a - For a moment, it
could have felt dicey.

BILLIE
For more than a moment it did feel
dicey.

PETER

Okay. And, then it was over. And,
it was fine. We were fine...

BILLIE

The kids were scared...
PETER

Of course...
BILLIE

Pete. What they saw was...

Does Pete know where this sentence is going? About him?
Regardless, he wants to end this.
JA 1st

PETER
Yes. Scary. For them, for sure. It
was. But, now we’re here. And, the
boys are upstairs watching a movie.

So, I guess I just... Emotionally,
we've already been through a lot
lately...

(to Charlotte/Charlie)
My dad died eight months ago. And,
our sons adored him. We all did.
And, it’s been hard. More so than
certainly I thought it would be.
It’s all been a lot. So, we came
here. That’s why we’re here.

Pete glances at Billie. That’s for her. As she said earlier:

“That's why we’re here.”

PETER (CONT'D)
So, let’s just be here.

Billie nods, conceding in her mind to let go of the

conversation. She does know he’s been hurting. Pete reflects

on a memory.

PETER (CONT'D)
My dad was a travel agent for
thirty years. Not that he ever went
anywhere. What he knew of the world
was based on research. Anyway, when
he retired-- alongside one of his
good buddies-- They received these
beautiful, cut glasses. A set.

Billie has heard this story way too more times.

PETER (CONT'D)
Well, they were precious to my Dad.
He just kept them up on a shelf.
Even when we went to visit, he
wouldn’t get them down. He was
saving them for... Who knows? Maybe
nothing. Well, when we were back
home for his funeral, I went to see
Hughie. That was his buddy from
work. And, we had a little drink to
toast my Dad in those cut glasses.
And, later, he tossed them right
into the dishwasher. And I asked,
“You use these for everyday?” And,
do you know what he said?

Charlie and Charlotte shake their heads.

*
JA 1st 33.

BILLIE PETER
(under her breath) “Every day is all we have.”
“Every day is all we have.”

He just nods, letting his profundity lie there. While
respectful of the “sentiment,” Charlie and Charlotte choose
their words/reactions, carefully.

CHARLIE CHARLOTTE
(bone dry) Today might be it. Yes.
... Very powerful.

PETER (CONT'D)
(not picking up on)
Yeah. So, to me. Today was today.

Charlotte clocks Billie, who seems to be “conceding” her
feelings about the avalanche/today.

CHARLOTTE
Even so. Maybe you report to resort
safety, yes? If only to give you
ease?

Pete knows to agree here.

PETER
... No, yeah. For sure.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, BATHROOM - NIGHT

Billie is on her side of the dual sink, getting ready for
bed. Pete enters, choosing (probably wisely) to use the other
sink. A moment of silence, then...

PETER
It was an avalanche. And, it was
scary. We experienced an avalanche.
And, look... You suffered some
shock.

Billie could bust up over this, but--

BILLIE
We did suffer some shock.

More bubbles underneath, but for now a couple comes to an
agreement of facts.

PETER
I don’t know why I said we had a
great day.

*

a

*
JA 1st 34.

BILLIE
It was scary.

PETER
It was scary.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, MASTER - NIGHT

ON PETE, in bed. His eyes are closed, but it’s doubtful he’s
asleep. After a beat, he opens his eyes, sensing. He turns to
see Billie’s side of the bed is vacant.

From the BATHROOM, the faintest sound of TINNY MUSIC.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Billie sits on the toilet, with the top lid down. Her face
illuminated by her iphone. She’s playing an addictive, mind-
numbing game. Candy Crush or Tetris. The “candy” or “blocks”
tumble much like an “avalanche.”

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK

SKI DAY 3

INT. HOTEL ROOM, MAIN BEDROOM - DAY

Billie and Peter are dead asleep. The clock radio cuts the
silence. An aggressive German morning show blares. Peter hits
the clock radio, but it slides behind the side table, still
blaring.

Billie stirs awake as Peter fumbles to retrieve the clock
radio. Finally, success. Silence, again. Peter and Billie sit
up on the edges of their sides of the bed, backs to one
another.

QUICK CUTS OF:

- Pete parts the curtains. Bright sun reflects off the white
vista. Pete squints a little. It’s a lot.

- All the ski gear is in messy piles. Billie, Pete and Em
pick through it all. Everyone with bedheads, looking
exhausted. But, true to form: Finn is dressed at the door.

EXT. RESORT SAFETY OFFICE - DAY

A semi-municipal, semi-commercial set of low wooden
buildings. There is a red cross on one of the windows.
JA 1st 35.

Out front, a couple of snow-mobiles and an official yellow *
jeep with a resort logo. *

INT. RESORT SAFETY OFFICE, ALL PURPOSE AREA - DAY

Snow melts on the institutional carpet of the common area,
complete with small break room/kitchenette. On four chairs:
Billie, Peter, Finn and Emerson in their ski outfits. Two

RESCUE TEAM MEMBERS sit at the break table on their phones. *
The only sound in the space: The twins banging their ski

boots together. Clack, clack, clack. After a beat, Billie

gently silences them for everyone's sanity.

Suddenly, the door to the outside bursts open. In steps
MICHEL (60s), the resort safety chief. He’s an old mountain
goat of a man. A bit intimidating. Unshaven. Wind-burnt face,
complete with an outline of his sunglasses/goggles. It’s
doubtful he believes in sunscreen. He stomps the snow off his
boots, staring at our family.

Michel has a soft, hushed German exchange with the Team *
Members. Clearly, they are “filling Michel in” as to the *
reason for our family’s presence.
ON BILLIE/PETE, having their own hushed English exchange:
PETE

Please don’t let that be who we

have to...
Michel looks back over at the family.

PETE (CONT’D) BILLIE

Yep. Okay... Yep. This is our guy.
INT. RESORT SAFETY OFFICE - DAY

Michel sits behind his desk. Peter and Billie, opposite him.

PETE
So, we wish to make a complaint.

MICHEL
Yes.

Peter stalls a beat. Billie picks up the baton.
BILLIE

About an avalanche that we... That
caused alarm yesterday.
JA 1st 36.

MICHEL
Yes.

PETER
It was around one fifteen on the--
We were at the, uh...

BILLIE
We were eating outside Wonnealm...

MICHEL
(pronouncing it correctly)
Wonnealm.

BILLIE
(not getting it right)
Yes. Wonne--

MICHEL BILLIE
Wonnealm. That place.

PETE
And, there was an avalanche.

MICHEL
The controlled avalanche from
Zwolferkoph. Yes.

BILLIE
Well, you say it was ‘controlled’
but people freaked out.
Peter plays the ‘reasonable man’:

PETER
It caused alarm. For sure.

BILLIE
Considerable alarm.

MICHEL
So, you are coming to say you were
alarmed?

BILLIE
Considerably.

Pete knows he needs agree here.

PETE
-.. Considerable. Yes.

MICHEL
But, everyone was safe?
JA 1st 37.

BILLIE
Well, we don’t know?

MICHEL
Yes, I can tell you, obviously.
Everyone was safe.

PETER
Okay. That’s good. That helps...

BILLIE
Why wasn’t there a warning?

MICHEL
There was a warning, posted at
lifts and at hotel receptions.

BILLIE
Well, we didn’t see it.

Against his better judgement,...

PETE
«+. Well...
BILLIE
(to Pete)
No? Is that not correct?
PETE
Maybe? I mean, I think... I may
have seen something about snow
conditions?
MICHEL

Yes. They were everywhere.

BILLIE
(still on Pete)
So, you saw it?

Pete realizes he shouldn’t have gone down this road.

PETE
I don’t... I’m just saying... My
point is. The point I’m making...
(Off Billie, confused)
Warning or no warning. Seen it or
not. What happened was scary.

Pete locks in with Billie: “Correct? Scary?” Pete is trying
desperately to get back on the same page. Back to what they
already “agreed upon.” Billie “returns” to the task.
JA 1st

BILLIE
Yes, it was scary.

PETE
Right.
(with authority to Michel)
And, we'd like an acknowledgment
that it was handled poorly.

MICHEL
It was handled perfectly.

BILLIE
No. No it was not. You can’t tell
me that was supposed to go like
that. Snow came and it just --
Snow went over all the plates!

Michel lets that hang there a moment.

MICHEL
‘Snow went over the plates’?

PETER
It was everywhere.

MICHEL
So, you are here alarmed,
considerably, about the matter of
the snow on your plates?

BILLIE
You know what, this was a big event
that traumatized the family. I
don’t want to make this a legal
matter but,...

MICHEL
We are not in America where you sue
because your coffee is hot,
madame...

BILLIE
Screw you. I’m a lawyer.

38.

Pete gets up, hoping to calm the situation/end it and shuffle

Billie out the door.

PETE
Okay, look, you’ve heard our
complaint...

BILLIE

Someone needs to hear it..
JA

PETE

And, we'd like a record kept
of it.

(then)
I assure you that we’re not
ugly Americans. But,
obviously, my wife was shaken-
- I had a feeling it was
under control-- But, we both
wanted to bring this to your
attention. And, now we have.

PETE

lst 39.

BILLIE
And, know I could see you in
court. I mean, I do trademark
law-- And, I love it-- But,
know that there are
litagators at my firm. And,
you better believe they will
not hesitate to have my
back...

Thank you for your time...

BILLIE

A “no thank you” for your time from

me.

EXT. SKI LIFT - DAY

Our family is in line. Billie is still processing what
happened in the office. Pete is searching his mind for the

right place to start here.

PETE

What a jackass, huh?
BILLIE

«+. Yeah.
FINN

Who's a jackass?

PETE

The man supposedly in charge,

that’s who.

Billie can’t help but side glance at her husband:

“AR man

supposedly in charge.” Beat of silence.

PETE (CONT'D)
.»+. Yeah. Big jackass.

As they scoot up, Billie notices a SIGN near the front of the
LIFT LINE. It’s a posting/warning for snow conditions and

“controlled avalanche” alert.

BILLIE
(loaded)

Is that the sign you may have seen?
JA 1st 40.

She doesn’t wait for Pete’s reply. She can guess it. She just
scoots up ahead, as we...

INT. HOTEL ROOM, MASTER - THAT NIGHT *
Billie is asleep. Pete’s side is empty. Through the cracks of *
the closed door BATHROOM, we see that the lights are on.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

This time, Pete is sitting on the toilet (lid down) on his
phone.

ON SCREEN. He scrolls through Instagram, liking various
people’s photos. He passes by a post for ZACHATTACKSLIFE. *
(Yep. Zach’s “handle.”) It’s a photo of them on a train. *

“Zarich Bound with @RealRosiel” #Switzerland #Train #NoAgenda
#LiveYourBestLife #KeepingItRealWithRosie

Pete scrolls through the subsequent photos on the same post *
that show them having arrived in Zurich, eating outside a
cafe, etc..

As Pete “likes” the post,... *
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK *
SKI DAY 4

INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Billie and Peter are in bed. Both dead asleep. The clock
radio reads: “10:27 AM.” Was the clock not set? Sleeping in?

ON BILLIE as her eyes, slowly, peel open. Is she sensing *
something? She jolts back at the sight of...

ON FINN, dressed to go, watching her sleep. She looks at the
time. Instant panic.

BILLIE
«+. Shit.

She rolls over to nudge Pete, noticing that he feel asleep
with his phone on his chest. As she gives him a shove awake,
we...
JA 1st

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

The family waits out front in ski-gear. Silent and grumpy.

EMERSON
Where are we going?

PETER
It’s a treat. It’s a Daddy
surprise. Should I tell them?

Billie is thinking about practicalities. The kids are hungry,

whiney.
BILLIE
Should I get us something from the
buffet?
Peter checks his watch.

PETE
... We are late...

BILLIE
Maybe fruit? Something?

Their CAR is pulled around by a VALET.

PETE
It'll be fine. Let’s go.

Billie grapples, but goes with no buffet...

EXT. HELICOPTER LANDING AREA - DAY

At a small airfield. The SUV arrives, pulling up next toa

Heli-Ski company jeep.

Another YOUNG COUPLE are waiting in a small helicopter.
There’s a PILOT hanging by the chopper. A young HELI SKI
EMPLOYEE approaches with her clipboard.

PETER
(jumping out, eager)
Okay, we're here! Sorry.

HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
The Stantons?

PETER
Uh-huh. Yup. Yes. That’s us.

Peter unloads all the equipment.
JA 1st 42.

PETE
(to Twins)
It’s heli-skiing, guys! Sweet,
right?

FINN
Yeah!

Em seems less enthused.

PETE
Yeah, it’s Daddy’s treat!

EMERSON
«.. I’m hungry.

PETE
Once you get in that powder, buddy,
you'll forget about that!

BILLIE
(to Em)
Maybe, they have a protein bar or
something.

HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
They were just about to go. *

PETE
Yep. Sorry. We overslept.

The chopper blades start going.

BILLIE
Do you have a bar?

*

The Employee does not understand “a bar.” She takes a stab at

an understanding. *
HELI SKI EMPLOYEE *

... Uh, yes. This is a seatbelt. *

BILLIE *

... What? *

HELI SKI EMPLOYEE *

What? *

With the chopper going, it’s loud. Everyone has to shout. *

HELI SKI EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
We should climb on...
JA 1st 43.

Pete’s gathering all the equipment up. She doesn’t have to
say that twice.

BILLIE
Oh. Okay. Is there a briefing now?
Things we should know...?

HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
We can do it on the way.

PETER
Are we good?

EMERSON
... Where’s my glove?

But, no one hears him.

BILLIE

(to Employee)

So, we're just going to...? Is
there not more information?

HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
As in?

BILLIE
What’s going to happen?

PETE
We'll get all that on board.

EMERSON
(louder)
Mom! I can’t find my glove.

FINN
Why are you so stupid?

BILLIE
(mom mode)
Hey. Uh-uh. No. Come here.

Despite the “urgency,” Billie takes time for a “teachable
moment.” Finn steps over, face-to-face with Em.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
(to Finn)
What don’t we do?

FINN
Call people names.
JA 1st 44,

BILLIE
Why?

FINN
It’s mean.

BILLIE

So, what do you say now?

Finn looks down at his feet, and utters a soft:

FINN
I’m sorry.

BILLIE
No, you need to look him in the
eye, Finn. Say it loudly and
clearly so that he can hear it.

FINN
(he does)
I’m sorry.

Billie is satisfied. The Heli Ski Employee ushers them toward
the chopper.

HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
We should go. The weather may
change.

BILLIE
Yeah, hold on. We lost a -- Wait.
Change? To what?

PETE
(an excited child)
Let’s do this! “Every day is all we

ha--"
BILLIE

We lost a glove, Pete. He needs a

glove.

(to Employee)
Change to, what?

PETER
There'll be a spare.

BILLIE
(to Employee)
Are there spares?

HELI SKI EMPLOYEE
«+. I don’t know...

a

 %
JA 1st 45.
PETER
There will be spares, let’s go.

BILLIE
She said she didn’t know...

PETER
He can wear yours.

BILLIE
("what?”)
I'll get cold Peter.
Pete rectifies, immediately. He needs to.

PETER
He can wear mine, we should --

BILLIE
It won’t stay on, Pete--

He motions to the helicopter. The Pilot is motioning them
over.

PETER

We can figure it out...
BILLIE

We need gloves. We needed

breakfast.
Pete shouts to the Pilot.

PETER
Do you have gloves?! Protein bars?!

The Pilot can’t hear. He just holds his hand up to his ear.

PETE
(beyond frustrated)
Billie, this cost a couple of
grand. It’ll be fine, okay? This is
going to be the best, yeah?

Pete starts to walk away from them. That visual gets a
visceral reaction from her. She snaps.

BILLIE
No. No Pete. We’re missing a glove,
we haven't had breakfast and
there’s something about the weather
changing!
JA 1st 46.

HOLD ON Pete, looking at the family, imploringly.

CUT TO:

EXT. HELICOPTER LANDING AREA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

The helicopter takes off, leaving a blizzard of snow in its
wake. As the snow settles, we see Peter, Billie, Em and Finn
standing there, watching it leave.

Billie and the kids walk back to the car, as Peter watches
the helicopter disappear up, up and away.

ON CAR, as they round the back. Billie spots the glove in the
snow and just gives it to Emerson.

INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

The family (finally) has a very late breakfast/lunch. Billie
lugs more loaded-up plates from the buffet to the booth.

PETE
Okay! So we still have a whole
afternoon. What do we feel up for?

EMERSON
The beach?

Billie has to laugh. Her son is clever. Pete does, too, but
he stays determined to rescue this day.

PETE
If we gobble all this down, we
could still get in an hour, hour
and a half, on the mountain?

BILLIE
I think we should cut our losses
for today. Maybe, we hunker down
for the afternoon? Build a fire?
S'mores? Play Uno?

Finn and Em approve.

FINN/EM
Yeah!

BILLIE
And, later, you guys can watch a
movie and,...

Her eyes lock in on Pete.

HHH FH HH FF

JA 1st 47.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
We can have some time.

It’s clear what the “time” will be: To talk. Pete puts on a
good face.

PETE

Love that idea.
INT. HOTEL SUITE, COMMON AREA - DAY - LATER
Billie and the Twins are playing Uno. But, no Pete, at the
moment.
INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME
Pete is back on the toilet (lid down) on his phone.
ON SCREEN. He’s texting with ZACH: “You sure? Is it cool?”
Pete hovers over the keys, pondering.
As he starts to type: “Totally. Billie would love...”
WE HEAR an OVEN DOOR SLAMMING and...

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Billie and Pete are in the KITCHEN, having a very hushed
conversation. The stove top is active with a few things
cooking.

BILLIE
So, they just showed up?

PETE
No, they were nearby. And, actually
called...

BILLIE

(very suspicious)
They just happened to call?

PETE
(“why would I lie?”)
Billie. Yes. They called and... I
didn’t know how to play it on the
phone.

*

*

*
JA 1st 48.

IN COMMON AREA:

ZACH and ROSIE, sit on the couch, having cocktails. From the
KITCHEN, the words are inaudible, but the tone is obvious.
And, it’s certainly not fooling Rosie.

ROSIE
(pleasant, calling out)
Can we help?

IN KITCHEN AREA:

PETE
(overly pleasant)
No, we’re good! You guys relax!

Billie pops over to the MASTER BEDROOM to shut the door.
Inside, we get a glimpse of the Twins sitting on the bed
watching a movie. [NOTE: They both have on headphones,
listening to the movie. ]

BILLIE
(hushed)
Well, I hope they like garlic bread
and kids spaghetti because that’s
what I have.

PETER
I’m sorry. I should have--

BILLIE
Yep. But, now you can’t. So, let’s
go offer them gold fish and baby
carrots.

Billie, in fact, grabs two bowls of those very items. The
“appetizers.”

INT. HOTEL ROOM, COMMON AREA - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
Billie and Pete join Zach and Rosie.

PETE
(maybe too much)
So, let’s hear about this trip!

ZACH
(laughing)
From what we remember...? It’s been
pretty epic.

PETE
From what I’ve seen, yeah!
JA 1st 49.

Pete keeps chiming in, hoping it all stays light.

ROSIE
We've hit three countries in four
days. It’s insane. Just Tuesday, we
were having morning strudel in
Dusseldorf and by that afternoon,
we're hiking along the Rhine River
in France.

ZACH
And, there may have been some
shrooms on one or all of those
days.

PETE
You have to.

Billie can’t help but furrow her brow: “Really, Pete?”

ZACH
Yeah, there’s something about
sporting backpacks-- Strangers just
want to give you things...

ROSIE
And, talk to you. They’re all about
your business. Where you came from.
Where you’re headed. Who you are
and what you do.

(laughs )

It’s been fun to fuck with people.
Make up shit about ourselves.

ZACH
(to Pete, jokingly)
Did you know I’m an archeologist?
Heading on a dig?

PETE
You didn’t.

Billie’s eyes can’t roll back far enough.

ZACH
We just made a decision. Our lives
at home are complicated enough.
This doesn’t need to be.

PETE
Hashtag no agenda. Yeah, we love
that.
JA 1st 50.

ZACH
We didn’t even know what tonight
would be. Then, you texted. Now
we're here.

Shit. Billie shoots a glance at Pete. “Unbelievable.” Why
should she be surprised?

ZACH (CONT’D)
We don’t even have return tickets?
Who knows what’s next?

BILLIE
You kind of do. Work on Monday.

ZACH
No, yeah. We'll get flights home.

BILLIE
That's going to be an expensive
“What's next?”

Swigs wine. Air out of fun.

ROSIE
«+. SO, you guys been getting in
some good ski days?

PETE
Oh, yeah. Good. Great days.

Pete can feel (and see) Billie’s expression. “Are you telling
them or am I?” Pete attempts to get a head of it.

PETER
I mean, we did have one incident
that was unnerving. But, we got
over that and now we’re having a
great time.

Zach wants to nod past the difficulty, but...

ROSIE
Oh, okay? Was it...?

Zach looks like, “Shall we leave it?”
PETER
It was just an event we came

through was all.

Zach can feel the social temperature change and tries to ease
things along.
JA 1st 51.

ZACH
It’s good to come through events,
isn’t it?

PETER

That's right. We’re good now. It
was nothing.

Peter’s pushed it too far for Billie.

BILLIE
It wasn’t nothing.

PETER
Oh sure. No, that’s the wrong word.

BILLIE
It was something.

PETER
No, yeah.

Billie locks in with Zach and Rosie. She tells the story. In
complete control.

BILLIE
We were outside at a restaurant and
there was a bang. And, suddenly
this wall of snow was rumbling down
the mountain. And, it did not look
like it was going to stop. It
looked like it going to kill us...

ROSIE
Jesus...

PETE
For a moment,...

BILLIE
No. No.

Billie is not asking to tell this story together. Pete
concedes the floor. For now.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
And, it wasn’t just us that felt
this way. People were getting up,
screaming. And, I screamed. And the
kids screamed. And, it felt like
this was it. We were going to die.
I looked at Peter. And, he had
jumped up and grabbed his phone.
Gone. Pete ran. Pete left us.

(MORE )
JA 1st 52.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
I guess in his mind he left us
there to get buried because he
could make it away and we’re too
far away or on the other side or...
I don’t know. And so, we just
stayed there and I put my arm
around our sons and I waited for a
moment. I waited for us to die
together. And then, bang.

(beat)
I’m still there. And the kids stop
screaming. And we realize, we're
okay. And then, Peter comes back
and we just... we just have soup. *

+ HH HH

 %

Silence. Billie and Pete just stay locked on each other. Who *
goes next? There’s an air to Pete. A man holding strong. In

his head, spinning for sure. A man who knows he’s on trial.

His manhood, questioned. Rosie doesn’t hesitate to support

and recognize Billie’s experience.

ROSIE
That’s intense.

BILLIE
Yeah.

Rosie joins Billie in her look to Pete. She’s curious how
Pete could have done that. Zach, on the other hand, is trying

to defuse. *
ZACH
Wow. Yeah, that’s... I guess, there *
are... You know, when something

like that happens, it can be, it
can be like a survival reaction?

Zach looks to Peter: “Yeah?” But, Pete is focused on Billie *
still. Is he plotting a defense? Zach answers his own
question.

ZACH (CONT’D)
It’s almost like... You know when a
snail or something goes into it’s
shell? It’s an instinct...?

Pete settles on his next move:

PETER
How could I even have possibly run
away?

BILLIE

-.. What?
JA 1st

PETER
In ski boots? It’s not even
credible. Can you run in ski boots?

BILLIE
... What?
PETER
Zach, can you run in ski boots?
ZACH
--- Um... ?
BILLIE
Fine. “Clomp away.” “Walk,

briskly...”

PETER
You said “run.” Rosie, can you run
in ski boots?

ROSIE
I don’t... Not very...?

PETER
Boom. Exactly...

ROSIE
Regardless-- I wouldn't, like,
leave my family to die?

BILLIE PETER
(pointing at Rosie) No, nor would I. And, I
That's “boom exactly...” didn't.

ROSIE (CONT'D)
It’s just she said you did?

BILLIE
He did.

PETER
Oh, for fuck’s sake, Billie. Why
are you..? And, I didn't leave you
to be buried...

BILLIE
I don’t know...

PETER
I do! I was there. And, I saw it
differently.
JA 1st
BILLIE
Great. Tell me what happened,
differently!
PETER

There was the snow coming. Almost
like an avalanche...

BILLIE
Oh my-- Now, it’s not even a
avalanche?!
Pete powers on.
PETE

I checked you guys, visually. And,
once it was clear that it was going
to be okay, I went to get help. For
the aftermath.

BILLIE
That doesn’t even make sense! You
knew it was okay? So, you went to
get help?

PETER
It was all very confusing.
Everything happened fast. BUT, I
checked you were going to be okay
and I went to get help.

BILLIE
That’s not what happened.

PETER
I can accept your version of the
truth Billie, why can’t you accept

mine?
BILLIE
Simple. Mine is true. And, not
dumb.
PETER
Well, you weren’t there with me.
BILLIE
No! I was at the table. With our
sons!
PETER

I love that you are making me say
that what happened for you,
happened for me.

54.
JA 1st

55.

Billie is beside herself. She heads out of the room. Focus
falls on Zach, who is looking for a way to say something. He *

comes up with:

ZACH
.+. This is very difficult.

Met with silence.

ZACH (CONT’D)

You know a lot of times people
involved in road traffic accidents
get things totally wrong...

ROSIE
Stop pitching theories.

Billie returns, holding the hands of the twins, who have *

their headphones round their necks.

BILLIE
I’m sorry kids, but just one
question.
PETER
Billie? No, no.
The kids are surprised to be in the adult arena, on show.
BILLIE
We were just telling our friends
about how we were having lunch,
remember? And, there was the
avalanche coming? What did Mom and
Dad do?
The Twins hesitate.
BILLIE (CONT'D)
You can say. It’s for the story. *
They wanted to hear. They can say
right, Peter?
Peter is acting as if she’s gone over the edge: “I give up.” *
PETER
Sure.
BILLIE
The truth.

Emerson looks at the floor.
JA 1st 56.

EMERSON
-- Um, -- Dad ran away.

Billie acts lightly, jolly, like this is all a game:

BILLIE
Heheh. Yeah, okay, is that how you
remember it Finn?

FINN
Uh-huh.

BILLIE
Okay, well let’s get you back to
the movie!

Peter just sits there as Rosie and Zach look uncomfortable.
Painful beat. Zach tries to ease.

ZACH
«+. They’re such great kids.

Billie returns.

PETER
Are they okay?

BILLIE
Of course, they’re okay.

PETER
You might have traumatised them,
you know that?

BILLIE
Oh, I traumatised them?

PETER
You care about being right so
fucking much, don’t you?

BILLIE
I just want to get things straight.

PETER
No, you want to get them “right.”
You're “right.” Well, I guess,
Billie’s right. So,
congratulations, Billie! You win.
Come on, everyone, give her a round
of fucking applause. Billie’s won,
again!!
JA 1st 57.

Peter starts to clap and stands up. Zach smiles, tightly. He
can think of literally nothing to try to make things better.
HOWEVER, he opens his mouth, as if to speak and...

ROSIE
(under breath)

There is nothing you need to say

here.
INT. HOTEL SUITE, TWINS’ ROOM - NIGHT
Billie sleeps, cuddled up to Em and Finn. WE HEAR the muffled
sound of TV emanating from another part of the suite.
INT. HOTEL SUITE, MASTER - NIGHT - SAME TIME
Peter is drinking a beer, cross legged, mindlessly watching
an episode of “Murder, She Wrote” in German. (Or, some other
cleared show, current or old. Whatever it is, it’s dubbed

over.)

SKI DAY 4

INT. HOTEL SUITE, MASTER - THE NEXT MORNING

CLOSE ON ALARM. It turns from 6:59 to 7:00. BUZZZZ! A HAND
comes into frame, shutting it off.

REVEAL Billie, her hand on the alarm, standing by Pete’s side
of the bed. Pete wakes up.

BILLIE
I’m going to take a solo day.
PETE
«+. Oh okay...
BILLIE
You and the boys can have an
adventure.
PETE

Yeah. Great. Maybe, we’ll cross
paths on the mountain?

BILLIE
Actually, I saw a leaflet for those
alpine rail slides. The boys might
enjoy them. They have them over at
the family resort. The one just
“minutes of 20” from here?

*

*

+ eH
JA 1st 58.

Billie has a shit-eating grin focused on Pete. Does she
suspect he knew of the family resort’s existence?

PETE
-+. Yeah. Love that idea.

As she crosses off, we...

INT. SKI HIRE SHOP, LOCKERS - DAY

Billie is starting her “solo day,” putting on her
uncomfortable boots. She snaps them into place, wincing, as
she watches a couple of YOUNG GUYS renting out equipment. One
well-built SKI SHOP EMPLOYEE is grabbing a couple snowboards
from up-high, exposing his wash-board stomach.

CHARLOTTE (0.S.)
Getting an eyeful?

Charlotte is there, smiling insinuatingly. [NOTE: Charlotte
looks dressed for skiing, but there will be no presence of
actual ski equipment throughout the following exchange. ]

BILLIE
Oh. No, I was just-- No.

Billie grabs her stuff and heads to the exit. Charlotte
follows.

CHARLOTTE
So. Where is your team?

BILLIE
Oh, I just felt like a solo day.

CHARLOTTE
Yes. Good. Adventure just for you.

BILLIE
... Yes. Okay. Adventure.

Charlotte smiles, knowingly.

CHARLOTTE
And, fun. Yes? Fun just for you.

Charlotte nods, as if they are definitely on the same page.
Billie has no idea what page that is, but she nods if only to
complete the moment.

BILLIE
.«.. Okay, well...
JA 1st 59.

Charlotte holds the door open for Billie and continues with
her. Guess the moment is not “completed.”

EXT. TUNNEL - DAY

Billie steps onto the MOVING WALKWAY. Charlotte follows,
studying Billie. Once again, Billie tries to get a precise
fix on this woman:

BILLIE
Are you heading this way to get to
your job as...?

CHARLOTTE
I'm interested, your boys:
naturally conceived, or in vitro
fertilization?

BILLIE
Oh - um. Okay.

CHARLOTTE
I have a friend and she was
thinking about it. I apologize if
for you it’s very --

BILLIE
No. No. It’s personal, yes. But, I
don’t actually mind talking about
it.

CHARLOTTE
Because they’re twins and you are
very old, yes?

BILLIE
Well, at the time--

CHARLOTTE
They are ten, no? So, still--

BILLIE
Yes. Okay. Yes, correct. We
considered a surrogate but in the
end, yeah, it worked out with the
help of a clinic. So, yeah...
(off walkway)
This seems slow.

Billie opts to walk on the walkway and pick up the pace of
all of this. Charlotte stays right with her.
JA 1st 60.

CHARLOTTE
And was it okay? Or, lots of
heartbreak?

BILLIE
Oh, you know, okay. Then,
heartbreak. Then okay. It was
everything. It was hard. But, I
kind of just gritted my teeth.

CHARLOTTE
Yes. You’re strong.

BILLIE
... Maybe.

CHARLOTTE

No.
Charlotte actually grabs Billie’s arm and gazes right at her.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
You are strong.

Billie nods. But, Charlotte just holds her stare. Relentless.

BILLIE
Yeah, no, I know that...
(conceding)

I am strong.

Charlotte smiles. Approving. Billie: “Wtf?”

EXT. SKI LIFT - DAY

Billie plops her skis down in the snow, just shy of the long
line for the lift.

BILLIE
Okay, well, I’m where I wanted to
get to, so thank you...

CHARLOTTE
No, no. This wait is not for you.

Charlotte holds up the divider rope, indicating to Billie to
skip the line. Billie picks her skis back up, as we...

EXT. SKI GONDOLA - DAY

Billie places her skis in the gondola holders herself.
JA 1st 61.

BILLIE
Okay, well, now I’m where I wanted--
Thank you for...

Charlotte shuttles Billie on...

CHARLOTTE
Adventure, yes? Now. Fun?

Jeez. She will not let this go.

BILLIE
Yes. All that. Just for me.

Unbeknownst to Billie, Charlotte waves to a young ski
instructor, MAROUANE. He waves back and steps onto the
gondola behind them. Then, Charlotte boards with Billie. What
is happening?

INT. GONDOLA - DAY

Billie and Charlotte ride up. There’s a decent-sized group of
SENIOR SKIERS on board. From the sound of them, they are all
Austrian.

CHARLOTTE
So, can I ask you... Have you had a
varied life of sexual experience?

BILLIE
--. I’m sorry? Have I--?
CHARLOTTE BILLIE
Have you had a varied life of No, I’m not asking so you’1l
sexual---? repeat it---

Billie glances at the Senior Skiers, self-conscious.

CHARLOTTE
(re: Skiers)
At that age, they rarely bother
with English.

It seems true, at this moment. None of them are paying
attention, involved in their own conversations. And, all in
German.

BILLIE
(scoffing, “unbelievable” )
Boy, you just get right in there,
don’t you?
JA 1st 62.

CHARLOTTE
I'm sorry, it’s just - I don’t like
so much bullshit all the time.

For the first time, Billie really hears something from
Charlotte that resonates for her.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
I don’t see the point of bullshit.

BILLIE
«+. No yeah. I don’t like so much
bullshit. No, that’s good.

CHARLOTTE
You just seem to me, like...

BILLIE
What? A “one man” woman?

Charlotte’s silence tells her the answer:
BILLIE (CONT'D)

Well, you’d be surprised. I know my
way around the -

She gestures a “dick.” Charlotte doesn’t seem convinced. Yet.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
In college, I did my fair share of,
you know,...

A bad gesture of a “blow job.” A short, BURST OF LAUGHTER
emanates from somewhere in the gondola. Billie glances over
wondering if someone caught that/understood. But, nope. All
of them are still in their own German worlds.

CHARLOTTE
I don’t like to perform that.

BILLIE
Well, no one likes it.

CHARLOTTE
(dead serious)
So, why do you do it?

BILLIE
No, I'm kidding. I like it. I mean,
I don’t LOVE it. It’s fine.

*

+ eH
JA 1st 63.

CHARLOTTE
I just tend to only do what I like.
I masturbate. Every day. Because,
that’s for me...

BILLIE
(half joking/half
wondering)
And, having sex with guests, I
guess...? *
CHARLOTTE
Yes. That is very for me. *
BILLIE
But, you’re married, right? *

Charlotte’s ring is there on her finger. She nods.

BILLIE (CONT'D)

So, how does that work for you? *

With everything? With Mr. Charlie

and other “guy friends?” *
CHARLOTTE

Easy. I work the winters here. In
the summer, my husband and I have
our farm. What I eat, doesn’t make
him shit.

BILLIE
Oh, okay?

CHARLOTTE
I think that is a beautiful phrase.

BILLIE
("Is it?”) *
... No, yeah. Absolutely.
(then) *
But, will you tell your husband
about...?

*

CHARLOTTE
Can we shake hands?

Charlotte holds out her hand. Billie, apprehensive, shakes.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Now, will I tell my husband about
that? Will you? Should we? Our
bodies touched. We have a little
intimacy.
JA 1st

BILLIE
Well, that’s not exactly...

CHARLOTTE

Why is there this absurdity if
these two parts of our bodies
touch?

(waves hand)
No big deal. But, the other ones.

(she mimics huge shock)
No! The bodies touched! The special
parts! Oh my goodness, what shall
we do! God is angry in his heaven!
The marriage must be over, the
special parts have rubbed!

(the slightly alarming act

is over)
It’s superstition.

BILLIE
Well, shaking hands can’t make
babies, whereas --

CHARLOTTE
Oh please. Sex doesn’t need to make
babies and you don’t need sex to
make babies. So. Shall we all move
on now? Please?

They're approaching the top of the gondola.

BILLIE
No. Sure. I’m just not convinced
it’s as easy as you make it out.
Isn’t your arrangement,
complicated?

CHARLOTTE
Isn't everything?

BILLIE
I guess I just feel, a
relationship, it’s-- What is it,
but kind of a story? And, it’s
important you’re both in the same
one, right?

CHARLOTTE
I guess I make my own story.

BILLIE
... But, are you happy?

64.
JA 1st 65.

CHARLOTTE
Yes. Very. Are you?
BILLIE
... Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I’d say
yes.
CHARLOTTE
So, good. You have your story the *
way you want it. And, I have mine.
Yes?

Billie thinks a little too long about this. Which, might
surprise her, too.

BILLIE
~-. Yes.

They have arrived at the top. The Senior Skiers and Billie
step off, grabbing their skis. But, Charlotte stays on.

ON MAROUNE, getting off the next gondola.

CHARLOTTE
(waving him over)
Okay. Now. Maroune will be your *
instructor. *
BILLIE

--Wait. Who will be my what--?
Charlotte just winks as she travels away in the gondola.

SENIOR FEMALE SKIER

(to Billie, Austrian *

accent) *

I like to perform it. And, on him, *

I would. *

Yep. At least, she understood everything. As Maroune *
*

approaches, all sexy smile, we...

EXT. ALPINE RAIL SLIDE - DAY

The SUV pulls into the lot. Unlike where the family has been
staying, this place is flooded with FAMILIES WITH KIDS. The
whole vibe feels different. Definitely, with kids in mind. In
fact, all the signage includes, “Berta the Cow,” the resort
mascot. Yep. A cow.
JA 1st 66.

EXT. ALPINE RAIL SLIDE - DAY

Em, Finn and Pete (in that order) are all in their individual
slide cars. An ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE works her way along
them, checking that they each know how to operate the hand
brake.

ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE
(to Em)
Forward to go.

Em pushes the handle forward to show he understands.

ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
Back to brake.

Em shows her that. The Alpine Slide Employee gives Em a

“thumbs up” and points to a security camera pointed at them.
Clearly, for confirmation that they understood about safety.
Em gives a “thumbs up.” The Alpine Slide Employee moves back
to Finn and goes through the same instructions, then to Pete.

ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
(to Pete)
Forward to go.

Pete does.

ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
Back to brake.

PETE
(jokingly)
Won’t be needing to.
ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE
(not having it)
Back to brake.

Pete eats crow and shows that he understands, as we...

EXT. TOP OF MOUNTAIN - DAY

We’re back with Billie and Marouane, who it turns out, is
very French. They stand at the precipice of a slope.

MAROUANE
So, first thing of instruction.
Coffee!
JA 1st 67.

BILLIE
To be honest,...
(pronounced wrong)
Ma-ROON-ON

MAROUANE
Marouane.

BILLIE
Mar-OO-NON

MAROUANE
Marouane. Like, marijuana, without
the ‘a’. Marijuan-a. Marouane?

Billie carefully says “Marijuana” and conscientiously stops
before the “a.”

BILLIE
To be honest, Marijuan... I didn’t
ask for a, uh-- I’m actually a
pretty decent skier.
MAROUANE
Why stop at decent? There’s better
than decent?
He pulls a thermos from his knapsack.
MAROUANE (CONT'D)
(displaying)
See? Coffee. Decent.
Then, he pulls out a flask.

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
Alpine coffee. Better, no?

Billie considers.
BILLIE
Okay, yeah. Why not? I can be more
than decent.
He adds a healthy pour of the flask into her coffee.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
Oh. Okay. A lot more than decent.

He winks at her, as she “bottom’s ups.”
JA 1st 68.

EXT. ALPINE RAIL SLIDE - DAY

Finn, Em, and Pete ascend the mountain, spaced a good
distance apart. (It operates much like a “roller coaster,”
pulling you up to the top on the track.)

ON PETE, as we watches SKIERS whisk by. A hint of “I wish I
was doing that” is undeniable.

LATER - They make it to the top and, one by one, descend.
ON EM. Contrary to skiing, Em appears not to be afraid of
speed on the slide. He’s an expert at navigating the curves.
This is his thing.

ON FINN. He’s more hesitant, riding the brake. His pace is
much slower.

ON PETE. True to form, he’s all speed.
PETE’S POV of Finn, up ahead. He’s gaining on him.
BACK TO SCENE.
PETE
(joking)
I’m coming for you, Finn!
As he gets closer,...
PETE (CONT'D)
Ease up on the break, buddy. It’s
fun!

ON FINN. He does, speeding up a little.

PETE (CONT'D)
There you go!

BACK WITH EM, having the time of his life. While fast, Em is
being responsible about his brake. Safe. He passes a CAMERA
BOX that snaps photos for purchase as you pass by.

BACK WITH FINN. He’s coming up on a sharp curve. He brakes a
good bit.

ON PETE, pulling his brake, but fast approaching.
PETE (CONT'D)
(jokingly)
Alright, I’m gonna tap you!

FINN
Don’t.
JA 1st 69.

PETE
(doesn’t hear him)
What?
FINN
Don't!

But, he does. Not a slam, by any means. Truly a tap, but it
does jolt Finn.

ON CAMERA BOX, flashing a photo of that moment.

EXT. ALPINE RAIL SLIDE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

Post ride. CAMERA HOLDS ON Finn and Em, standing near the
entrance. Each has a PHOTO. Em’s photo is of him beaming on
the ride. Finn’s is of Pete bumping into him.

Behind them, in the distance and out of earshot, is Pete with
an ALPINE SLIDE EMPLOYEE. We can't hear them, but it’s pretty
clear Pete is being reprimanded.

After the “reprimand,” Pete approaches.

EMERSON
Did you get kicked out?
PETE
("yes")
No. I just thought we’d, you
know,... do other things.
EMERSON

Because, you got kicked out?

EXT. SLOPES - DAY

Billie is having a great run. She seems very relaxed.
Marouane follows closely behind, encouraging and instructing.
They get to a stopping point.

MAROUANE
Nice!

BILLIE
Whoa. That felt so different.

MAROUANE
Yes because you leaned into it.
With confidence. Just flow. No need
to work so hard.
JA 1st 70.

Billie likes that. “No need to work so hard.”

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
(pointing down slope)
Now, you tackle this.

Below, a good stretch of pronounced moguls.

BILLIE
Oh, I can’t do moguls. I know that.

Marouane is not having it. Presents her with the flask.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
(laughing)
So, just “alpine” now. No coffee?

MAROUANE
(sexy fucking smile)
Decent. Better.
(indicating flask)
Best.

Billie takes a huge swig off the flask.

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
Do like faster? Or slower?

Billie is confused.

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
(re: moguls/slope)
Do you want to go faster or slower?

BILLIE
«+. Faster.

Maroune steps up behind Billie, perhaps a bit too close, but
not invasive.

MAROUANE
(pointing at slope)
Hands out in front. Find a line and
Narrow your stance and go around
each bump. Not over. Maintain a
steady rhythm.

BILLIE
(little overwhelmed)
Maybe, I just follow you...?

MAROUANE
No. Find a line. Steady rhythm. Do
not look back. I will be there.
JA 1st 71.

Billie exhales, prepares. She takes off. It’s wonky, but she
finds a line. As Marouane follows, shouting instructions,
We...

INT. FAMILY RESORT RESTAURANT - DAY

The Twins are having hot cocoa and snacks. Again, the vibe is
different. FAMILIES everywhere. A costumed version of “Berta
The Cow” roams the room, taking photos with guests. Pete
approaches with a resort pamphlet.

PETE
Alright, let’s see what we can get
into here. Ski, obviously. Right?
We can ski. Ski park.

Pete glances up, slightly. He’s hoping the boys perked up to
those options. Nope. He keeps reading.

PETE (CONT'D)

What else? There’s a toboggan run.

Arcade. Indoor mini golf.
(actually surprised)

Indoor waterpark?

Pete starts perusing options, silently. Probably, to avoid
the evidence that this place is awesome.

PETE (CONT'D)
Okay. Yeah. A good amount of stuff.
What are we thinking?
But, the boys are silent.
PETE (CONT'D)
What’s wrong? Something on your
minds?

Em and Finn stall, looking at one another.

PETE (CONT’D)
You can tell me anything.

EMERSON
You don’t seem like you’re having
fun?

A dagger to his heart. Riddled with a guilty feeling.

PETE
«+. What? Why would you think--?
JA 1st 72.

FINN
Do you want to be here?

PETE
What? Of course-- Guys. Listen to
me. I love being with you. More
than anything. You know that,
right?

The boys are give nothing at first. And then, just shrugs.
They aren’t sure. Brutal.

PETE (CONT'D)
Is this about the slide? Daddy did
get kicked off. But, because Daddy
was having too much fun.

Nope. That doesn’t seem to be it.

PETE (CONT'D)
Is this about yesterday? The
helicopter? I just wanted that for
all of us. I messed that up. I
overslept. And, we should have had
food. Is that what makes you think
that I’m not having fun?

Em and Finn look at each other, again. Clearly, it’s because
of something else. But, maybe they don’t want to say? Pete
fears the worst: the avalanche.

PETE (CONT'D)
I love you two. So much. I’ve just
been--

Pete avoids “an excuse.”
PETE (CONT’D)
Let’s finish this day, right. Just
us boys. What are you thinking?

Pete slides the resort pamphlet in front of them. They glance
for a beat. But, then...

FINN
Can we have screen time? Back at
our hotel?
Pete flashes a big smile, hiding his stress.

PETE
... Yeah. Absolutely.

*
JA 1st 73.

EXT. SKI WARMING HUT - DAY

Billie descends more moguls, pretty expertly. Marouane right
behind. She comes to a stop, exuberant. She’s breathing
pretty hard.

BILLIE
That’s a lot of work.

MAROUANE
But, good, yes?

BILLIE
No, yeah. Worth it.

Billie is definitely winded.

MAROUANE
Let us rest, yes? Warm up? And
then, go again?

Off Billie’s nod, Marouane skis toward the WARMING HUT, as
We...

INT. SKI WARMING HUT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Marouane lights an oil heater. Billie can’t help but eye the
smooth back of Marouane’s neck. His back is spectacular, too.
A specimen. The light is flattering and cozy over the bare
room: Water; supplies; sleeping bags rolled up; emergency
equipment; table and chairs.

MAROUANE

How do your calves feel?
BILLIE

Oh, I can feel them alright.
MAROUANE

You might want to... For ten

minutes or so?

He’s taking his ski boots off. Billie starts to pull her feet
out of her boots.

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
(slapping his thighs)
It can burn here, no?

BILLIE
Oh yeah. Yup.
JA 1st 74.

MAROUANE
Sometimes I can give people, just
on the calves or something, a rub?

BILLIE
(wry) |
Oh. Sometimes you can do that, can
you?
MAROUANE

Yeah. That’s something I do.
Marouane kneels to rub her calf.
MAROUANE (CONT'D)
Yes? Just to relax out those
muscles a little. It’s recommended.

BILLIE
Oh well, if it’s “recommended.”

He rubs gently, but firmly. More sports massage than sensual
come-on. Not too much.

MAROUANE
Uh-huh?

BILLIE
Uh-huh. Um. That’s. Yeah. Uh-huh.

As he rubs, keeping his hand below her knee, Marouane seems
to be studying her.

MAROUANE
So, I’m curious. Who is Billie?

Billie scoffs. Is that a line?

BILLIE

... What?
MAROUANE

Why is that silly? To want to know?
BILLIE

It just sounds like a, uh... I

mean, “Who?” How do you even
answer...?

MAROUANE
(without missing a beat)
I am very confident, but never
afraid to admit when I am wrong. I
tend to fall in love too fast.
(MORE )
JA 1st 75.

MAROUANE (CONT'D)

And, heal too slow. I love to
paint. And, I’m good at it.
However, I cannot sing. But, that
does not stop me from doing it
everyday.

He heads up a bit higher, up above the knee, massaging the
front of her thighs. She shifts her body subtly to let him
know it’s okay.

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
Skiing is a passion, yes, but

teaching feeds my soul. To witness
someone surprise themselves. I live
for that. And, I am the only child
of a single mom and she is my hero.

He lets that sit, then...

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
That is how I answer.

Billie is flush. Her heart racing. He moves up higher,
massaging with his thumbs, up towards her inner thighs. It
feels good.

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
Uh-huh?

BILLIE
Uh-huh.

MAROUANE
You do not need to share with me
who you are, Billie. But, you must
promise me.

Marouane locks in, holding Billie’s gaze. His eyes stare
right at her lips.

MAROUANE (CONT'D)
You must promise that you will
never find it silly when people
want to make it about you.

And, with that, a kiss. A perfect kiss, but not lustful. The
kiss breaks. Marouane holds his gaze and slides his hand up
her body. But, Billie stops him.

BILLIE
Thank you. But, that’s where this
ends.

Marouane does not hesitate. He respects that. Backs off.
JA 1st

MAROUANE
I apologize if I...

BILLIE
No. I did what I wanted to do. And
now, I want to ski.

She starts to collect her things.

BILLIE (CONT'D)
But, make no mistake, I could fuck
you right through that wall. If I
wanted. But, I don’t. And, I
wouldn’t. That much I know about
me.

INT. SUV - DAY

Pete drives in silence. The boys in the back. Pete glances in

76.

the rearview, pondering. He needs to get back some “love.”

PETE
Hey, guys. The bidet-- The European
thing-- You know what that’s really
for?

The shake their heads.

PETE (CONT'D)
Cleaning your butt.

They perk up, looking at one another. Is he kidding?

PETE (CONT'D)
Yeah. It sprays water up and, uh...

Pete decides to double down on “cool points.”

PETE (CONT'D)
Yeah. It cleans the shit out of
your butthole.

The boys are a mixture of shock and joy.

FINN
Are you serious?

PETE
Yep. Mom said “feet,” but after you
take a dump, it’s to clean your
butthole.

*
JA 1st 77.
A giggle fit begins. The mood shifts. Pete feels better, but
thinks to be smart and safe...
PETE (CONT'D)
But, no hijinx now that you know.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
Billie squats in a little copse of fir trees, taking a piss.
She looks through the trees to where Marouane waits, leaning
on his poles, staring the other way out and down into the
valley.
She’s happy. Proud. Relaxed.

Over this image, WE HEAR: CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP, as we...

INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - DAY

Billie heads across reception. Clomping in her ski boots. A
woman on a mission. She heads into the...

RESTROOM.

INT. REST ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

She clomps straight into a STALL. From the looks of it, she’s
alone. Even if she wasn’t, she wouldn’t seem to mind.

IN STALL. She has it in mind to masturbate. What starts as
confidence slowly evolves into awkwardness as:

- She pulls off her gloves and lowers the zipper on her ski
suit. But, her jacket is bulky. Need to lose that.

- Her goggles and helmet clatter to the floor.

- She tries sitting on the toilet, trying to get her hand in
her pants. But, still too many layers.

- She stands, navigating zippers and straps. Tangled.

OFF SCREEN, “someone” enters. More CLOMPING boots. Billie
freezes. The FAUCET comes on. Whoever it is, is washing her
hands. Then, the powerful AIR DRYER comes on. Nice cover for
Billie.

- She leans back against the door, putting a foot up on the
toilet. Success. An angle. Just as she “begins,...”
JA 1st 78.

THE LATCH GIVES. She falls back onto the floor. Disheveled
but not indecent. Our BATHROOM WOMAN stands at the air dryer,
perplexed. Billie starts to collect herself and things, as...

BILLIE
I, uh, had a problem in there. I
think I just... I think it was just

one of those classic times when
your contact pops out and, uh...
Yeah I bent over and blacked out
when I stood up too fast. So,...

She trails off. The moment lingers a bit until...
BILLIE (CONT'D)
(clears throat)
Yeah, we don’t have to... This
doesn’t need to continue...

The Bathroom Woman goes back to air drying her hands.

INT. HOTEL SUITE, BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

Billie and Pete are at the dual sinks, separated by the
mirror. Plenty of tension. Mostly, felt by Pete.

PETE
... How was your solo day?

BILLIE
Great. Yeah. It was great.

PETE
That’s awesome.

Pete assumes she will reciprocate. Long beat. Nope. So,...

PETE (CONT'D)
Me and the boys had fun.

BILLIE
Good.

PETE
Yeah, we hit the slide for a good
while.

BILLIE

Until you got kicked off?

Doh. As she heads out, we...
JA 1st 79.

INT. HOTEL SUITE, MASTER - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER *
Pete emerges from the bathroom. No Billie. Guess she’s not *
sleeping there, again. Resigned, Pete heads to his side of *
the bed, as... *
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK *
SKI DAY 5 *

INT. HOTEL SUITE, MASTER - MORNING

QUICK IMAGES OF:

- Alarm goes off. “Pete’s” hand shuts it off.

- The room is dark. Pete sits on the side of his bed.

- Pete picks his ski stuff out of the piles. *

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Pete stands just outside the TWINS’ ROOM. The door is
slightly ajar.

PETE'S POV of Billie and the boys on bed, watching something
on an iPad together. Billie is holding it up so they can all
see as they lie on their backs.

BACK TO SCENE, as Pete lightly taps and opens the door.

PETE
Good morning.

EM/FINN
(staring at iPad)
Morning, dad.

BILLIE
.-. Morning.
PETE
Are we...?
BILLIE
I think we’re going to do this for
now.
PETE
«+. Okay. Zach texted about joining *

us. I think Rosie is sleeping in. *
JA 1st 80.

BILLIE
Great. You guys have fun.
Beat.
PETE
Should we meet up for dinner? Do
the restaurant?
BILLIE
Sure.
Beat.
PETE

You guys have fun.

But, the three are lost in the iPad.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Pete steps off the elevator. Zach, dressed to ski, is there.
And, he’s wearing a_knit cap.

ZACH
Let’s do this.

Pete considers.

PETER
Hold up.

As Pete heads back onto the elevator,...

CUT TO:

EXT. LIFT - DAY

Pete and Zach are in line. And yes, Pete is now wearing his
dad's old hat. No helmet for this cool motherfucker. Zach,
discreetly, takes a hit on his vape pen. He hands it to Pete
with a wink.

ZACH
A little Amsterdam in Austria.

Pete considers: “Why not?” Zach snaps a quick selfie with
Pete.

ZACH (CONT’D)
Hashtag it begins!
JA 1st 81.

LATER - Zach and Pete are at the front of the lift line. They *
shuffle into place. The same Lift Operator is there. Pete *
waits, but the Operator says nothing. He beams. He’s “cool.”

EXT. PISTE - DAY

Zach and Peter are at the top of a run. Pete can’t help it. *
This feels good. To be standing here now. Free.

PETE
How great is this?

ZACH
So great.

PETE
All I have to do, right now. My *
only obligation? Go down.

ZACH
Yeah. Live your best life.

PETE
Yeah. Every day is all we have.

They fist bump. And, with that, push off. Confident. Free. *

EXT. SLOPE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Pete’s having a great run. Maybe, a little loose from the
vape, but in control.

A SNOWBOARDER cuts across his path, nearly colliding. *
Pete loses his balance, struggles. He can’t stay up and bites *

it hard. His momentum carries him, sliding down the slope, in
a direct path with a SNOW GUN MACHINE.

*

He skids to a halt, hitting his head on the machine. Not too
hard, but he feels it. He sits up and checks the back of his *
head for blood. But, luckily, none.

EXT. SKI LIFT - DAY

Billie and the kids are in line for the lift. [NOTE: This a
two seater.] Rosie skis up into line.

ROSIE
Well, hello there. Going up? Mind
if I...?
JA 1st 82.

Billie doesn’t object. Rosie joins them as they approach the
front of the line.

BILLIE
You getting a late start, too?

ROSIE
Yeah, I got a massage.

Billie’s face, jealous. “Good for you.” They are next up.

BILLIE
Em, Finn, you go together. But,
wait at the top, okay?

The Twins shift into position and the lift takes them up. As
Billie passes the Ski Lift Operator, he raps his knuckles on
Billie’s head.

LIFT OPERATIVE
Helme sind fur Kinder!

ROSIE
Hallo...!

BILLIE
Oh, he’s just checking that it’s
secure...

ROSIE
Ein wenig Respekt bitte!

The Lift Operator switches to Italian:

LIFT OPERATIVE
li Vaffanculo, non capiscono.

ROSIE
(Italian)
Si lavora in fatto di ospitalita,
essere ospitali, cazzo!

Then, she switches to Spanish:

ROSIE (CONT'D)
Folla a tu madre y tu existencia!

The Lift Operator does not know Spanish. That was her hope.
Billie is surprised by Rosie’s multi-lingual assertiveness.
They shift into position, as...

BILLIE
What was all that?
JA 1st 83.

ROSIE
Basically, I told him he was a
piece of shit in three languages.

Rosie can’t leave it at that. One more scolding:
ROSIE (CONT'D)
(in Dutch)
Je bent een imbeciel!
(winking at Billie)
Four.

The lift scoops them up, as we...

EXT. LIFT CHAIR - DAY

Billie and Rosie ride up.

ROSIE
So, how are you doing today?
BILLIE
Better. I guess? I don’t know. I’m *
sorry that you were there for all
of that the other night. *
ROSIE
Why are you apologizing?
BILLIE
I shouldn’t have involved the kids.
ROSIE
Okay. But, you have nothing to
apologize about. What he did was *
fucked up.
BILLIE
Well, I shouldn’t have attacked *
him. His dad died eight months *
ago...
ROSIE

Yeah, well, people die. It sucks.
It happens. But, that doesn’t
excuse why he ran away like a
fucking pussy.

Billie lets that sink. Someone is validating her.
ROSIE (CONT'D)

You don’t owe him anything. You
have a right to be angry.
JA 1st 84.

Emotion swells up for Billie. All the shock. All the
confusion. She can’t hold it in anymore. Rosie lets her have *
the moment. Eventually, Billie collects herself.

BILLIE
«.. Thank you.

ROSIE
I‘1l tell you this much, if Zach
ever did that to me, I'd kick him
in the nuts and he’d never see me
again. It’s black and white.

Billie glances ahead. This part she may not agree with: “Is *
it black and white?” *
EXT. TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN BAR/RESTAURANT - DAY

Outside at a table, Zach and Peter are drinking lagers. Pete
is still feeling his head.

PETER
Do I seem okay?
ZACH
Yeah. I think. *
PETER
Should you run through the *
concussion protocol things? *

He points to his phone.

ZACH
Uh-uh, I think you’re fine. *
PETER
I haven't been repeating myself, *
have I?
ZACH
I don’t know? Like, you asked if *

you seemed okay a few times?

A BAR WOMAN, who might be a bit tipsy, approaches. She *
addresses Peter over the loud music: *
BAR WOMAN
Hi?
PETER

Hi.
JA 1st 85.

BAR WOMAN
Hi, yeah. My friend just wanted to
say hi.

PETER

Oh. Oh, okay?

BAR WOMAN
Yeah, she thinks... She likes the
way you carry yourself.

PETER
Oh, well that’s kind. Which
[woman]...?

He looks over to a group of YOUNG WOMEN in their twenties,
early thirties.

PETER (CONT'D)
That’s nice.

BAR WOMAN
She thinks you’re the best groomed
man in this bar.

PETER
Well, thank you.

She retreats.

ZACH
Nice!
PETER
Oh man. That’s embarrassing!

(beat)
Do you wanna...? Should we send
them a drink? Or you want to [go

over]... ?
ZACH
Oh, um, I don’t...
PETER
No. Sure.
(then)

I mean, it just doesn’t happen to
me all the time. Not like you.
Right?

ZACH
Oh, well. You know!

*
JA 1st 86.

PETER
Yeah. Come on.
ZACH
(laughing)
Well, me and Rosie... It’s been

pretty steady for a while, now!
PETER
Oh sure. But, still. It’s fun to
flirt, right?
Pete thinks about that. “Good times.”

PETER (CONT'D)
Yeah. I was good at that.

The Bar Woman returns.

BAR WOMAN
Hi. Sorry.

PETER
Hi.

BAR WOMAN

It wasn’t you.

PETER
... What’s that?

BAR WOMAN
It wasn’t you. She didn’t like the
way you carried yourself. It was
him.

She points behind them to a GOOD-LOOKING BAR GUY.

PETER
Oh. Cool.

BAR WOMAN
Uh-huh. Sorry.

PETER
(trying to flirt)
So, what’s your name?

BAR WOMAN
Bye.

She walks off. Peter is a bit drunk. He looks at the Good
Looking Guy.

*
JA 1st 87.

PETER
He is. He is a catch.
(shouts over)
You're a catch my friend!

Zach takes a shot at making it bettet for Pete.

ZACH

I can see a resemblance...
PETER

It’s okay, man. I’m not... Yeah.

All good. So much so.

EXT. VILLAGE STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

An active party scene, already. People have moved straight
from the slopes into the bars.

Pete and Zach, a bit drunk, are in line for a “Club. " But,
as of now, they are just waiting outside an “elevator.”
[NOTE: Most clubs in the village are below ground. ]

PETE
This place is the Ibiza of the
Alps!

ZACH
Who says that?

PETE
I say that!

Zach and Pete “high five.” Eww. As they step onto the
elevator, we...
INT. CLUB - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

The elevator door opens and our senses are in overload with
loud euro pop. It’s quite a scene.

LATER - Pete is on the packed dance floor, uninhibited and
quite drunk. Zach approaches with two more steins of lager.

Pete drinks down some more beer, noticing the...

GOOD-LOOKING GUY from the top of the mountain. Pete stumbles
over. He smiles at him. Then, out of nowhere he makes a
lunge. It’s a half hug, half wrestle. The weight of Pete
sends them to the floor.
JA 1st 88.

The Guy gets up and actually tries to help Pete off the

floor. But, Pete swats his hand away. It’s hard for the Guy, *
or us, to understand what’s going on in Pete’s head. His mood *
and behavior is erratic and all over of the place. *

Zach shuffles Pete out of there, as...

EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DUSK
The guys stumble along.

ZACH
Maybe we should get you some
coffee? Pizza?

PETER
Nope. No. I need to stay hungry.
For dinner. With my family.

ZACH
Some food might be smart...
PETER
I love my family.
ZACH
I know. *
PETER
Billie and I didn’t even do it for *

the longest time. Kids. But, then
we said if science says we're
parents, then we’ll be parents.
That’s awesome. If not, that’s
okay.

(beat)
And, science made us parents.

It’s hard to tell where he stands with that.

PETER (CONT'D)

I just... You lose a parent and the
ticking gets louder. Time is...

Want to know how old you are? Look
at your kids. Every day they
change.

ZACH
Yeah. We get older.

Pete grabs for the last tangible excuse in his mind?
JA 1st 89.

PETER
But, you can’t forget about you. It
happens. You think about yourself.
That’s all I did. That’s all that
was... I didn’t mean...

Pete stops. “To run away?” Was that what he was going to say?
Pete clams up, shaking off whatever he was thinking.

ZACH
I think coffee might be a good
thing.

PETER

I know that’s what I said.

INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Billie and the kids are already at the table, waiting.

I/E. HOTEL CORRIDOR/SUITE - SAME TIME

Peter walks down the hotel corridor towards his room with a
cup of coffee. Far from sober. At the suite door, Pete
breathes. Steadies himself. He opens the door. It’s empty.

PETER
Hi? Hello? People?

INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER
Billie and the Twins are now eating.

ON PETE with them at the table, showered and in his regular
clothes. Pete flashes a smile at his family trying to look as
sober as possible. He drops his knife. CLANK!

He regains himself and tries to cut a crostini in two with a
knife and fork. It crumbles and he tries to gather it up with
his finger tips as he imagines a sober man might. He pops it
into his mouth.

PETER
Mmm! Yum.
(he looks at Billie)
Yours?
BILLIE

I’m not that hungry.
JA 1st 90.

PETER
Oh, did you eat? I didn’t eat. To
stay hungry. So, I’m hungry.

BILLIE
Yeah I ate. We ate a little.

Peter sees an opportunity to be magnanimous, an example to
Billie and the world.

PETER
Oh, okay. I don’t mind.

That appears to be it for the dinner chat. Back to silence.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Peter and Billie walk behind the Twins, who rush ahead with
the key card. Peter has sobered up some, but his reactions
are still a bit off. Billie walks ahead of him. The Twins
head into the room.

PETER
Billie?

Billie stops outside the door.

PETER (CONT'D)
I just want to say I’m sorry.

BILLIE
You don’t need to do this now.

PETER

I want to.

(exhales )
What happened is what you said
happened. I ran. And, I don’t know
how to make sense of that. I was
just afraid to... If I said it out
loud, then it’s true. And then,
what? That’s who I am? I’m this
selfish, terrible person capable
of...

Emotion starts to bubble up...

PETER (CONT'D)

Which is, I guess, what I am. A
coward. But, it doesn’t mean that I
don’t love you. And, that I don’t
love the kids. I don’t know...
JA 1st gl.

Tears come.
PETER (CONT'D)
I’m so sorry. I didn’t know how to
make this better for you and the
boys. Or, for me. And, I still
don’t. I can’t stop an avalanche,
Billie.

His cry grows, odd and all-encompassing. His body shakes.
Billie regards this, somewhat cooly. After a beat:

BILLIE

This is what you say four days ago.
Instead, you made me feel like an
idiot. Like it was my fault. I
didn’t ask you to stop an
avalanche, Pete. I just want you to
want to survive one... with us.

As she heads into the room,...

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK

SKI DAY 6

INT. HOTEL SUITE - THE NEXT MORNING
QUICK FLASHES OF THE STATE OF THE ROOM:
- Multiple pairs of shriveled-up gloves on the radiator.

- BATHROOM. Almost-dry socks draped along the shower curtain
rod.

- Piles of ski clothes. A collective heap.

QUICK FLASHES OF OUR FAMILY:

- The Twins in their ROOM, asleep.

- Pete in bed, on his side. His eyes, open. Lost in thought.

- Billie sits on the couch, drinking coffee. The drapes still
closed. She looks over at the...

Pile of ski clothes.
QUICK FLASHES OF BILLIE:
- Pulling some dry socks down from the curtain rod.

- Collecting some dry gloves from the radiator.
JA 1st 92.

- Folding/stacking some of the ski clothes into piles.
QUICK FLASHES OF PETE:

- He stares at the alarm, waiting for 6:59 to become 7:00. It
does. And, as if a game show buzzer, he turns it off before
it even barely makes a sound.

- Pete opens the curtains. A wall of snow blankets most of
the window. Clearly, there was a huge dump last night.
Despite his low energy, Pete’s eyes can’t help but go wide.
His wet dream of conditions.

INT. HOTEL SUITE, COMMON AREA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Pete emerges from the Master. The Twins [still in pajamas]

are seated at the dining table. Billie brings them each a
bowl of oatmeal.

PETE

PETE

Looks like we got hit with a big
dump of snow.

Pete might be regretting his choice of words and the timing.
“We got hit with... snow.” Billie just glances up at Pete.
Not an angry glance. Not a forced smile. Just a look that
seems to “study her husband.”

Pete goes to grab his ski clothes, noticing that Billie
folded and stacked the Twins’ stuff. His stuff remains in a
pile.

INT. SKI-SHOP - DAY

CLOSE ON BOOTS, slammed down on a counter.

REVEAL Billie, standing with the Ski Rental Kid. The rest of
the family hang back, within earshot.

BILLIE
These are too tight. They pinch.

BILLIE
Okay, look, maybe you can’t
understand me. But, the safer bet
is you're pretending. These boots
are too fucking tight.

SKI RENTAL KID
It’s good to be tight.

The Kid looks over at Peter. Can you help me here? *
BILLIE
He’s not in my body. And, you're
not in my body. These hurt. I want
some that don’t.
He looks at the receipt she presents.

SKI RENTAL KID
You leave today?

BILLIE
Yeah, I put up with them for longer *
than I should have. But, I deserve *
to be comfortable. *

EXT. LIFT - DAY
The family is at the front of the line.

LIFT OPERATOR
Smart to get out early. Fresh foot

of powder at the top. Blue skies. *
Can't get better than that. *
PETE *
Oh yeah, great way to end our *
family vacation, for sure. *
Billie can’t help but offer up “side eye” to Peter. Really? *
Now, he calls it a “family vacation?" The family scoots into *
place for their chair, as... *
PETER *
Should we hit The Beast for a final
run? Cut the first tracks? Finn? *
FINN

Yeah!
JA 1st 94.

PETER
Em?

Em just shuffles along. Peter knows better than to ask, but
he knows he had to. He moves on quickly to...

PETER (CONT'D)
(aside to Billie)
Sound good? The Beast?

BILLIE
(aside back)
Sure. Unless, I decide to go to
Switzerland.

Peter laughs a bit. Hoping it’s a joke. But, Billie does not.

PETER
--. Yeah...

The chair scoops them up, and we...

EXT. LIFT - DAY

The family ascends. No one is speaking. After a beat:

EMERSON
I hate skiing.
FINN
No, he doesn’t.
BILLIE EMERSON
Finn,... (stealing mom’s line)

You're not in my body.

EMERSON
It’s cold and dumb. And, you're
always wet and it hurts when you
fall and it takes forever if you
have to go to the bathroom. And,
people are stupid. They don’t look
where they’re going. So, you’re
always scared you're going to die.
What’s fun about that?
(beat)
And, I have to go to the bathroom.

Smartly, no one protests or chimes in. Billie just puts her
hand on Em’s knee, letting him know he has been heard.

EXT. TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

We're back where the photo was taken in the beginning. The
family stands at the edge of The Beast, staring down the
steep incline. FEARLESS SKIERS swish right past them.

For some reason, no one is initiating a dissent. Not even
Pete. Em’s words still haunting?

Suddenly, BANG! BANG! BANG! From a far distance, an avalanche
is being set off. Despite the faintness, the whole family -
even Pete - flinch. Finn grabs his dad. Is he holding on for
comfort or is he afraid his dad will flee again?

A moment of clarity for Pete. A decision.

PETE
You know what I’m thinking I might
need. Some hot cocoa. Maybe, we
wait this out? Warm up? I’m not
sure I’m feeling this.

The boys nod. Billie glances at Pete. A hint of smile. It’s
about time. They start for the lift, but...

PETE (CONT’D)
(to Billie)

You should take the run. If you

want. We'll wait for you at the

bottom.

Billie considers, as we...

LATER - Billie watches from the top of The Beast as Pete and
the boys descend on the lift.

BILLIE’S POV of the boys, leaning onto their dad. Pete puts
his arms around them to get them warm.

BACK TO SCENE, as she looks down at the slope ahead of her:
The way back to her family. Then, she glances behind her:
Switzerland. As she ponders, we...

EXT. BASE OF MOUNTAIN - DAY

Peter and the boys wait at the base of the run, looking out
for Billie. An “avalanche” of skiers descend. But, no sign of
Billie. Long beat until,...

EMERSON
(a bit worried)
-.. Where is she?

*
JA 1st 96.

PETE
It’s okay. Your mom’s better than
all of us.

They scroll the area, but still no Billie. After another
beat,... A faint “Pete!” emanates from somewhere distant.
Peter listens intently until it’s clear... “Pete! Pete!”
Billie is calling out from up high. Without hesitation, Pete
pops off his skis.

PETE (CONT'D)
Stay right here...

EMERSON/FINN
Dad.

PETE
Everything's fine. Stay right here.

Pete runs up the slope, disappearing into the crowd of
skiers. We stay with Em and Finn, waiting. Long beat plays
out. Finally,...

Through the crowd, we see Peter appear, carrying Billie in
his arms. He sets her down.

EMERSON/FINN
Are you okay?

BILLIE
I am now.

She shares a glance with Pete. An understanding of what this
was: Letting their sons see their dad as a “hero for a
moment,” instead of “the coward they had witnessed.” Peter
seems grateful. Then,...

BILLIE (CONT'D)
(very casual)
I should get my skis.

With that, she just walks back up. But, not before...

BILLIE (CONT'D)
(whispering to Pete)

By the way, knee deep powder. Best

run of my life. And, you're not

going back up there.

She flashes a smile. And, Peter smiles back. He understands.

JA 1st 97.

INT. HOTEL SUITE/HALL CORRIDOR - DAY - LATER

The family is preparing to leave. All the roller suitcases
are packed and stationed by the door. Pete opens the door to
the room. The Twins chase one another out.

PETE
Hold up. You guys are more than
capable of taking your own bags.

The Twins return, grabbing their suitcases and head back out.

As Billie passes by Pete in the doorway, he stops her.

PETE (CONT'D)
I'll give you more reasons not go
to Switzerland.

A promise to be there. Shared smiles. Two people committing
to the story they want to be a part of. They kiss.

BILLIE
I hope you do. Because, I will kick
you in the nuts.

Pete seems confused, trying to decipher her words, but goes
with:

PETE
(“understood” )
«+. Sounds good to me.

With that, she heads out, as we...

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Pete, Billie and the Twins step off the elevator. The Twins
run ahead.

CHARLOTTE (0.S.)
No, this is not truth!

Charlotte approaches.

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
You must stay forever!

Pete, again, tries to pinpoint Charlotte’s “role.”

PETE
Thank you, Charlotte, for
everything you’ve done for us as

CHARLOTTE
Friend! This is of course! What the
fuck good am I if I’m not that?!

Charlotte laughs and hugs them, whether they want a hug or
not. “Good-byes” all around. Billie and Pete start to peel
off...

PETE
(to Billie, hushed)
Well, I tried...

BILLIE
(hushed)
Yep. Still don’t know who the fuck
she is?

Charlotte did not hear that, but she reaches out and lightly
grabs Billie’s arm. Stopping her. Pete heads over to the
Twins, as...

CHARLOTTE
So,... Your “lesson” good, yes?

Billie considers her answer.

BILLIE’S POV of Pete rough-housing with the Twins. A man
attentive. At this moment, a dad.

BACK TO SCENE. Billie, warmed by the image.

BILLIE
(nodding)
This story works for me.

Charlotte beams, approving. As Billie walks away, Charlotte
hones in on a group of YOUNG MALE SKIERS, passing by.

CHARLOTTE
My friends! I’m sorry I was not
here to meet you earlier! But, you
must have everything. And, you will
want everything from me!

EXT. HOTEL - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

The family make their way out to VALET. Nearby, Zach and
Rosie are handing their backpacks over to a SHUTTLE DRIVER.

BILLIE

Glad you did.

A genuine sentiment. A “thank you” to Rosie for hearing her.

ZACH
We'll see you back in the States.
PETE
What’s next for you guys before
that?
ZACH

Who knows...?

ROSIE

Oh my-- What is wrong with you?

(then, to Billie/Pete)
What's next is a shuttle to Zurich.
Layover in London. On standby in
Dallas. With hopes to be in LA by
midnight on Monday to be up for
work seven hours later.

ZACH
(smirks, shrugs)
Hey. Live your best life, right?

PETE BILLIE
You know it. Oh, yeah.

Zach and Rosie head onto the shuttle. Pete and Billie’s
smiles fade just a tad as, individually in their own
“worlds/heads,” they seem to be reflecting on that sentiment
differently, now. “Live you best lives.”

INT. SUV - DAY

Our family is in their same positions. As they round a
curve,...

POV of a LARGE BUS ascending from the opposite direction. It
and our SUV are on a path to intersect at the next curve.

BACK TO SCENE, as Pete and Billie glance at one another. A
sly smile comes to Billie’s face. Pete reciprocates. A mutual
decision.

Pete lays on the gas, booking it to beat the Bus to the
curve. The Twins’ excitement grows as, with finesse, Pete
smoothly navigates and dodges the Bus, successfully.

The whole family cheers the success!

BILLIE EMERSON/FINN
Nice. Awesome, Dad!/So cool!

A shared thrill. We watch as, slowly, this feeling dissipates
and things go “back to normal.” Back to silence. And,
gradually, the family returns to the tableau we met them in.
- Billie goes to her phone.

- Pete focuses on the drive.

- Finn looks out the window.

- Em goes back to his book.

BEAT.

ON PETE, glancing at Billie, on her phone (She won’t notice
it.) Then, he glances in the rearview at his sons in their

own worlds. Then, his eyes go back to the road.

ON BILLIE, looking up from her phone. She glances at Pete,
lost in the road. She studies him for a beat.

ON BILLIE/PETE as they stare out at the road ahead, lost in
their own thought: “Is this my best life?"

As they simultaneously glance out their side windows, we...

EXT. AUTO-ROUTE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

HOLD ON the SUV as it continues down the winding road.

And, again, a mix up of German and English. And, the slogan:
“Come Again! If You Can...”
