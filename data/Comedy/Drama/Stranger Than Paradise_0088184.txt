Scene 12 : Int. Evening. WILLIZ's room,

 

WILLIE and EVA are sitting (on their respective sleeping
places) watching a football game on television. As WILLIE
reacts to events in the game, EVA observes these reactions
as well as what is happening on the TV screen.

WILLIE: So you see the guy that has the ball?

EVA: Uh-huh. a

WILLIE: That's the ‘quarterback’. He can either hand

it to one of the other runners, or he can pass it

downfield. He's kind of like, uh, he's like the gen-

eral, you know? He's in charge of the offense. He con-

trols the offense.

EVA: Oh...So what does the quarterback do when his

team becomes the defense?

WILLIE: What?

EVA: What does the quarterback do when his team becomes

the defense?

WILLIZ: (pause) The...the quarterback's not on the defense

ever... don't know how I can explain this to you. Just

watch the game.

EVA: (after a long pause) I think this game is really

stupid. :

WILLIE sighs and continues watching the screen,

EVA walks over to the bed, and pulls a cheap upright vacuum
cleaner out. She takes it over to the kitchenette, and plugs
it into a socket.
WILLIE: (looking up from his paper) You know, its
really too formal to say "I want to vacuum the floor".
EVA: Oh. What do you say?
WILLI£: Well, you say " I want to choke the alligator.”
So if somebody comes in while you're doing that, you
say "I‘*m choking the alligator."
EVA: (smiling) Oh, okay. I'm “choking the alligator".

EVA turns on the vacuum cleaner and begins sweeping.
