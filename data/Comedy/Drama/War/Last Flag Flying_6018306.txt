EXT. SAL'S BAR & GRILL - NIGHT 1

A seedy neighborhood. LARRY "DOC" SHEPHERD, wearing a heavy
windbreaker, stands idly on the street. An AWOL bag is on the
sidewalk at his feet. A garment bag is slung over his
shoulder. He studies the little working-man's bar across the
street as the title "DECEMBER 13, 2003" comes up.

INT. SAL'S BAR & GRILL - NIGHT 2

Small and dark. A pool table, a few booths, not much decor.
SAL NEALON leans on his elbows on his side of the bar, doing
a crossword. He's in his late 50s and wears a cropped
mustache, going gray, like the sides of his short-cropped
hair. He wears a black T-shirt, revealing a USMC tattoo on
his arm. He smokes a cigar, chewing its end more than it
needs. An edgy dude - you wouldn't want to fuck with him. At
the other end of the bar, COPS is on a TV that hangs
suspended from the ceiling. On the show, a nervous couple try
to explain to a sarcastic cop what they are doing in the
projects if not buying drugs. Sal's only customer, O'TOOLE,
an old functioning alcoholic, is watching. At some point Doc
enters, pausing near the door. O'Toole gives him a cursory
glance. Doc hangs his garment bag on a hook on the stanchion
and takes a stool. He puts his AWOL bag on another stool and
settles down with a little uncertainty.

SAL
I ask you, you ever see these cops
catch a killer or a rapist on this
show? Ever see them put the cuffs
on some crooked CEO fuck?

Wanders over to Doc.

SAL (CONT'D)
What can I get you?

DOC
Beer.

SAL
What kind?

DOC

Doesn't matter.

SAL
Bottle or draft?

DOC
Draft.

(CONTINUED)
2.

Sal walks back over and starts filling up a glass while he
continues his conversation with O'Toole.

SAL
Nah, they're always just drug users
and johns... just people hurtin',
trying to find a little pleasure in
life.

O'TOOLE
What have you got against cops?

SAL
Nuttin'. What I got something
against is good ol' stupidity.

Sal wanders back to Doc and serves him the beer. Doc looks
into a manila envelope and withdraws a five dollar bill and
lays it on the bar.

SAL (CONT'D)
You comin' or goin'?

DOC
Passing through, kind of.
(about money)
Keep it.

Sal takes Doc's money, puts it in the register, and goes back
to his crossword.

DOC (CONT'D)

Good beer.
SAL
Yeah, it's from Pennsylvania.
DOC
How long have you had this place?
SAL
Too long.
DOC
It's real homey.
SAL
You think so? Where the hell do you

live?
Doc doesn't get Sal's wit.
DOC

New Hampshire. Portsmouth.

(CONTINUED)
Sal is back on his puzzle.

DOC (CONT'D)
Home of the Navy prison.

SAL
I know the place.
DOC
It's an okay town.
(drinks)

So you're Sal.

SAL
That I am.

DOC
So Sal, how do you suppose I knew
that?

SAL

Name's on the sign outside.
Doc smiles, looks around, turns to O'Toole.

DOC
Not exactly a hot spot, huh?

O'TOOLE
Not anymore.

DOC
I like it, though. It's homey.

SAL
Yeah, you said that. That's why I
was worried about where you lived.

DOC
You don't remember me, do you?

SAL
I don't remember half the women I
fucked, and that's just the ones I
didn't have to pay. How am I
supposed to remember you?

DOC
Well, I remember you.

Sal looks at him more closely, squints. The cigar droops.

(CONTINUED)
SAL
Can't be.

DOC
Could be.

SAL
No way.

DOC
Way.

SAL
Sweet Jesus... Doc?

DOC

(bemused )

Doc... Nobody's called me that ina
long, long time.

SAL

Fuck me. You made it, Doc.
DOC

Yeah.
SAL

O'Toole, look at this. Old buddy
from 'Nam. I saved his life once.

O'TOOLE
Then you must be some kind of
fuckin' hero.

DOC
He never saved my life.

O'TOOLE
Didn't think so.

SAL
And now he's come to kick my ass.

O'TOOLE
Long overdue and well deserved.
I'll hold his coat for him.

DOC
No, I'm not here for that.
SAL
You gotta excuse me, Doc. I'm shit

for names.

(CONTINUED)
DOC
Shepherd. Larry Shepherd.

SAL
Right. Shepherd. Nineteen year-old
kid. Navy corpsman.

DOC
Once.

SAL
Yeah, well, we were all something
once. Now we're something else.

DOC
So you do remember me?

SAL
â€˜Course I do, you saved my fuckin'
life.

O'TOOLE
I thought it was the other way
around.

DOC
You heard, I got busted down to E-
One?

SAL

Most unfair. The green weenie -
they broke it off in you. What can
I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?

DOC
How's Mueller?

SAL
Ol' Mueller the Mauler. Maybe he's
alive. How should I know? Have
another beer. On the house. Fuck,
I'll have one with you.

DOC
You're not in touch with him?

SAL
Saw him medevacked out, and that's
all she wrote.

DOC
Mueller got hit?

(CONTINUED)
SAL
Oh, yeah, you weren't there by
then... it was not pretty.

Sal now comes over closer to Doc.

SAL (CONT'D)
I still think I rate credit for a

save.
DOC
Who? What?
SAL
You, you fuck. I saved your life.
DOC
I don't remember anything like
that.
SAL

Captain said, Doc is coming
unhinged. He's gonna blow. Take him
for two days to Pleiku. Show him
around Disneyland.

DOC
I do remember Disneyland.

SAL
Hell yeah you do.

DOC
But all I remember is gettin' laid
and drunk.

SAL
Well, yeah... that's why it was
there.

DOC
Mueller was with us.

SAL
I did that too. I said, Cap'n,
Doc's too fucked up for one person
to handle. Take Mueller, he said.

DOC
(sarcastic)
Oh, yeah, and things were much
better after that.

(CONTINUED)
SAL
C'mon, Doc, we had a good time,
didn't we? We had some fun.

DOC
Sure we did. Not sayin' we didn't.

SAL
We did, the three of us.

DOC
Yeah. I laugh sometimes when I
think about it.

SAL
Really? Do you?

DOC
Yeah, kind of.

SAL
Why not? You got to laugh at every-
fuckin-thing. I laugh at my
prostate gland, little son of a
bitch, laugh every time the doctor
gives me a fingerwave, two times a
year.

DOC
It's good you know how to do that.
Wish I could do that.

SAL
So what was it, three years?
DOC
Ended up about two, with good
behavior.
SAL

That's not so bad.

DOC
It was pretty bad, but it was a
long time ago.

SAL
BCD?

DOC
Yeah, but at some point instead of
calling it a Bad Conduct Discharge,
I started calling it a better
career decision.

(CONTINUED)
SAL
Fuckin-A. You're alive and upright.
So you got out, and then what? You
stayed there?

DOC
Didn't really have anywhere else to
go.

SAL

Fuck all. Listen here, how did you
find my lonesome ass?

DOC
Easy. On the internet. You can find
anybody on the internet these days.

SAL
That's fucked.

Doc kind of laughs as O'Toole gives them fresh beers.

SAL (CONT'D)
So whaddaya do in Portsmouth, for a

living?

DOC
Stocking clerk, at the Navy
Exchange.

SAL

You're shitting me.

DOC
(old joke between them)
I wouldn't shit you, you're my
favorite turd.

LATER - O'Toole is asleep on the pool table. Doc is crawlirig
into a booth. Sal is also finding a spot to lay down.

DOC (CONT'D)
(stretching out)
Don't you go someplace when you
close?

SAL
Like where?

DOC
I don't know, home?

SAL
It'll be there tomorrow.
INT. MEN'S ROOM - MORNING 4

A dreadful little space full of generational stains and
graffiti. Sal washes his face, pulls out some paper towels
and dries. He looks at his reflection in the mirror. This is
the face he has earned. This is the place he has landed.

INT. SAL'S BAR & GRILL - MORNING 5

Doc and O'Toole are still asleep. Sal draws a beer, starts
eating a cold piece of pizza.

SAL
Reveille, reveille, drop your cocks
and grab your socks. Reveille!

Sal has to stir Doc. Finally he wakes up and looks at Sal.

SAL (CONT'D)
You want a beer? This is the last
of the pizza.

Doc shakes his head.

SAL (CONT'D)
I'm still a little fucked up from
last night. I'm getting too old for
this shit, frankly.

DOC
(sitting up)
What's the deal with the grill part
of Sal's Bar & Grill?

SAL

Gone to rust is the deal.
DOC

Too bad.
SAL

Used to put out a righteous burger.
Serious meat with a nice slice of
raw onion and nothin' else, except
for mustard and ketchup, of course.
No lettuce or pickles or any of
that crap. But people lost their
taste for honest hamburgers, so I
let the grill go. Why? You hungry?

DOC
Just curious.

(CONTINUED)
10.

SAL
There's Mexicans here now, so we
can get some chorizo con huevos.
Hell, we qualify for menudo. You
got the balls for that?

DOC
No, thanks. There's something I'd
like to show you, though, if you're
up for it.

SAL
I'm always up for it. Shoot.

DOC
You got a car?

SAL
I'm a fuckin businessman, of course
I got a car.
(stirs O'Toole)
Yo, O'Toole, open up for me today,
okay?

O'Toole nods his head, then goes back to sleep.
INT. SAL'S TAURUS - MORNING - MOVING 6

Not much of a car. A 20-year-old Taurus Wagon. Sal drives
through a light drizzle, on a rural road.

SAL
I just fuckin' love it, you know?
It's like priceless.

DOC
What is?

SAL
The Navy. They put the cock to
you, then they let you work at the
Navy fuckin' Exchange.

DOC
I got five people under me.

SAL
You're a fuckin' inspiration.

DOC
You know what amazes me about you?

(CONTINUED)
11.

SAL
Could be anything. I'm a pretty
amazing guy.

DOC
You turn over your bar to a
customer, you get in your car, and
you drive me to hell and gone, and
you don't even know where we're
going.

SAL

I didn't think it would take so

fuckin' long.
Doc refers to a folded up MapQuest sheet of paper.
EXT. RURAL CHURCH - MORNING 7
A humble building that might have been a barn once. It lacks
a steeple and stained glass, but it makes up for it with the
spirit we will encounter inside. We see the Taurus Wagon in

the parking lot.

SAL (0.S.)
You gotta be kiddin' me.

INT. SAL'S TAURUS - MORNING 8

Sal looks at the place, doubtfully.

DOC
C'mon, you're gonna love this. I
promise.

SAL

I don't know, Doc, you seen one,
you seen them all.

Doc grins as they start to get out of the car.
INT. CHURCH - MORNING 9
A small black congregation, listening intently to a sermon.
Sal and Doc enter, drawing some notice, but then space is
made for them. A middle-aged preacher is at the pulpit with
the aid of a cane. It is MUELLER.
MUELLER
..--Now remember, Jesus and Judas,
they were friends...

As the sermon continues, Sal leans toward Doc, whispers:

(CONTINUED)
12.

SAL
Oh. My. Fucking. God. Is that who I
think it is?

DOC
I told you you'd like this.

Sal is wildly amused. He turns and looks around at the
others, wanting to share his excitement.

MUELLER
But, oh, how a good man can be laid
low by a false friend, how havoc
can follow the lying smile...

CONGREGATION
Amen!

SAL
Amen, brother!
(whispers to Doc)
The dude was a world-class drinker,
gambler and cocksman.

DOC
Shhhh.

SAL
And likely a speed freak. How the
hell did you find this place?

DOC
The internet.

MUELLER
Oh, yes, in the spirit of
friendship, have a drink... have a
toke... have a snort... the devil
has a friendly face and a winning
way. But behind that smile, as
behind the kiss of Judas...

SAL
(whispers)
I think he's makin' this shit up
just for us.

Reverend Mueller eventually finishes his sermon, looking
closely at his two visitors... a long judgemental look. An
echoing of Amens rolls wall to wall.

SAL (CONT'D)

(shouting out)
Oh, Amen, brother! Amen!

(CONTINUED)
10

13.

MUELLER
Thank you, brothers and sisters,
and praise the Lord for our
fellowship here today.

SAL
Praise the Lord!

MUELLER
I see we have some visitors among
us today. Welcome to our Sunday
services. Would you like to stand
and introduce yourselves?

Sal needs no second invitation. He springs to his feet, snaps
off a salute and sounds off:

SAL
Salvatore Nealon, Sergeant, U.S.
Marine Corps, retired.

Heads in the congregation turn. Whispers become a buzz that
fill the church. The Reverend totters a bit at the pulpit,
holding on. RUTH, Mueller's concerned wife, studies how her
husband is responding. Doc tugs at Sal's sleeve, but Sal
pulls him to his feet.

SAL (CONT'D)
And guess who this lad is.

INT. PARSONAGE - AFTERNOON 10

Mueller, Ruth and their two guests sit at a table laden with
a ham and heaping bowls of vegetables and greens. Mueller
sits rigidly, his eyes on Sal and Doc, wary.

SAL
Man, oh, man, southern ham, thank
you, ma'am. Listen here, Ruth, I
hope this old man appreciates you.

RUTH
Oh, I think he does.

SAL
â€˜Cause if ever he don't, just pack
a bag and come live with Sal.

RUTH
You don't have a wife?

(CONTINUED)
14.

SAL
No, ma'am, neither chick nor child.
I do have a lady friend, but she
don't cook worth a damn. She has
other talents, if you know what I
mean.

Embarrassed, she turns to Doc.
RUTH

And you, Mr. Shepherd? Are you
single or married?

DOC
I married a wonderful woman, Mrs.
Mueller.

SAL

Bet she don't cook like this.

RUTH
I get it, Mr. Nealon, you haven't
been eating well.

SAL
Am now.

DOC
The light of my life, my Mary. A
heart as big as... anything. A
real pretty girl, with a great big
smile...

SAL
Nice...

DOC
She had a little... slowness...
because of a thing when she was
born.

SAL

What's that mean, she's retarded?

DOC
No, she could do anything anybody
else could, she was just kind of...
delayed. A great mom, a great
wife.

RUTH
What does she do?

(CONTINUED)
15.

DOC
Oh, no... I'm sorry. I lost her
last January. Breast cancer.

RUTH
I'm so sorry.

Sal stops with fork in mid path.

SAL
Sorry, Doc. You know me, I didn't
mean nothinâ€™.

MUELLER
We pay for the things we say,
Salvatore.

SAL
Well, then you can add it to my
tab.

DOC
That's all right. You didn't know.

MUELLER
Your tab is long overdue, I
suspect.

RUTH
Do you have any children, Doc?

DOC
(hesitates)
Just one, a son. Larry Junior.

RUTH
Richard and I have a boy and a
girl, and we have four
grandchildren.

SAL
Richard?

MUELLER
(quickly)
Honey, don't you have some coffee
and pie for our visitors, before we
send them on their way?

RUTH

(rising)
I have a peach cobbler for dessert.

(CONTINUED)
16.

SAL
Oh, man, peach cobbler... this is
livin'!

Ruth goes to the kitchen, looks over her shoulder at her
unusual guests.

MUELLER
(to Doc)
I'm glad to see you prevailing over
your hardships.

DOC
Doin' my best.

MUELLER
You, at least, seem to have turned
out to be a decent man.

DOC
Try to be.

MUELLER
I regret any role I played in all
that foolishness that happened back
in Vietnam.

Sal shakes his head, as if trying to defog his brain.

SAL
What the hell did you do with
Mueller the Mauler, preacher? He
in the witness protection program
or something? Where're you keepin'
him?

MUELLER
I grew up, Sal, and I found a
purpose along the way.

DOC
You don't have to feel sorry.

MUELLER
I always figured you for a lifer,
Sal. Is that the way it worked out?

SAL
I re-upped, sure. I was expectin'
all the dominoes to start fallin',
like they said they would. I was
all ready to kill commies in San
Diego, but they never showed up -
they just all kind of disappeared.

17.

SAL (CONT'D)
Can you believe people are now
going to Vietnam on fuckin'
vacations? They get their pictures
taken where fifty-two thousand
young Americans took their last
dump. Fuck me.

MUELLER
So you mustered out on principle.

SAL
I mustered out with a plate in my
fuckin' head and one-hundred
percent disability. That was the
good news.

MUELLER
How did that happen?

SAL
Fuck if I remember. Somebody hit me
on the head with something. I
believe drink was involved.

He laughs. The other two can't manage it.

LATER - They sit in the living room having cobbler and 11
coffee. Doc hasn't touched his, Sal digs into his, while
practically flirting with Ruth.

SAL (CONT'D)
..+.I was on the shy side of
insubordination most of the time,
but I could get away with it
because of my dashing good looks
and my boyish charm.

Mueller snorts.

MUELLER
I guess we're all just lucky to be
alive, praise God.

SAL
I tell myself that.

Doc sits with his arms on his knees, head down, sinking down
into himself. One by one they notice him. Sensing their
attention, he raises his head.

SAL (CONT'D)
(nodding to the untouched
cobbler)

You gonna eat that?

(CONTINUED)
MUELLER
You okay, Doc?
(a beat)

What's wrong?
Doc shakes his head.
RUTH
It's best to talk, whatever it is
that's bothering you.

DOC

My son... because of my son, I came

here, found you guys... Maybe I
shouldn't have...

RUTH
Your son?

DOC

Larry Junior. A year ago he joined

the corps.

SAL
Ooh-Rah.

DOC

But two days ago they came and told

me he had been killed.

SAL

Aw, shit, Doc. Why didn't you say

anything earlier?

DOC

He died in Baghdad. His convoy got

ambushed, and they said he had
unloaded his weapon on them and
died with his bayonet in his hand.
(beat)
He's coming home tonight. They're
gonna bury him at Arlington. Full
honors. A hero.
(beat)
Can you guys come with me?

18.

12 LATER - Sal smokes a cigar out on the porch. He listens to12
what is being said inside, Mueller all over Doc with sympathy

and God.

(CONTINUED)
19.

MUELLER
.Â»+. and I can promise you this:
someday you will meet your wife and
your son again, in a better place,
and all of this will seem like a
momentary separation.

That does it. Sal tosses his cigar and goes inside.

SAL
Oh come on... what better place did
they go to? Las Vegas? Miami Beach?

MUELLER
Doc knows the place I speak of.

SAL
Well, then show him. Doc's got a
map. Maybe he can find it on the
internet.

MUELLER
Only when you see it will you know
it, and in your case, Sergeant,
it's odds-on you'll never get to
see it.

SAL
Then I guess I won't miss it.

MUELLER
Oh, you will miss it dearly, every
moment of eternity. Do you know
how long eternity is?

SAL
It ain't going to matter, but of
all the billions of people floatin'
around in your heaven, how come
none of them ever got the word back
to the rest of us?

MUELLER
One of them did.

SAL
Oh, that guy... weak on exact
details, if you ask me.

MUELLER
I'm not asking you.

(CONTINUED)
20.

SAL
(to Doc)

Listen here, Doc, I'm sorry for
your loss, but I ain't gonna blow a
bunch of smoke up your ass. The
worst thing that can happen to
anybody has landed on you, and now
you got to deal with it.

MUELLER
You were a hazard when you were
young, and now you're just an old

fool.
SAL
I got your fool dangling, fool.
MUELLER
Fuck you.
SAL
There he is! That's the Mueller I
know!
DOC

Please, c'mon, I didn't mean to
cause trouble.

SAL
I'll help bury your boy. I might
not be able to get you into heaven,
but dammit, I can get you to
Arlington.

Ruth opens the door from the kitchen, pauses, listens.

DOC
Mueller?
MUELLER
(uncomfortable)

I'd certainly like to help, but...
SAL

Don't worry - he'll stay here and

pray for you... very valuable.
RUTH

Richard, could I see you for a

moment?

Mueller slowly gets up.

(CONTINUED)
21.

DOC
Please.

MUELLER
I don't get around so well, as you
can see.

DOC

It's just in the car.

As Mueller leaves the room, Sal is all smiles.

SAL
Oh, he's comin' with. That's
affirmative.

DOC

But he said...

SAL
Don't matter what he said. I
guarantee his old lady's gonna
shame him. Right now she's in there
saying, "You got to go with..."

13 INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 13
RUTH
+. with that poor man, Richard. He
needs you.
MUELLER

He'll have qualified people there
to counsel him.

RUTH
Yes, but who will protect him from
that... Sal person?
MUELLER
(chuckles )

Well, I do know that a lot of shit
can go sideways when Sal is around.

RUTH
What in the world has happened to
your vocabulary?

MUELLER
Sorry, dear.
RUTH
You can't refuse friends in a time

of need.

(CONTINUED)

22.

MUELLER
Friends? I haven't seen these guys
in decades.

RUTH
You can't refuse anyone. You're a
preacher.

MUELLER
They were a bad time in my life,
honey.

RUTH

The man lost his son, Richard.

They look at each other for a beat, the way long-married
people can do.

RUTH (CONT'D)
I'll pack you an overnight bag.

INT. SAL'S TAURUS - NIGHT - MOVING 14

Sal leans forward over the wheel. Doc is next to him, and
Mueller is in the back. Sal looks over to Doc.

SAL
That seat goes back a little.

Doc starts to make the adjustment.

SAL (CONT'D)
I've had this car 17 years. She's
been good to me. Technically it's
a Taurus, but I call it, a cli-
taurus...

Doc smiles, and Sal looks at Mueller in the rearview mirror,
giving him nothing.

SAL (CONT'D)
You have to wear that collar
everywhere you go?
(no answer)
Take it off, why don't you, and
relax, Richard.

MUELLER
I am relaxed.

SAL
Never knew that was your name. You
ever go by Richie? Dick?

(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
23.

SAL (CONT'D)
(a beat)
You like Dick?

Mueller refuses to take the bait.

SAL (CONT'D)
Never heard of any brothers named
Richard. Didn't think they named
them that.

MUELLER
Richard Pryor. Dick Gregory.
Little Richard...

SAL
Now he likes dick.

Even Doc laughs. The car suddenly fills with light. A semi
is tailgating them.

SAL (CONT'D)
The fuck..?

MUELLER
Change lanes. Get over.

Sal gets pissed.
SAL
All right fuck face, you want to
play, I'll play.

The speedometer moves to 70, 80...

MUELLER
Pull off the road! Get to the
side!

SAL

Hold tight. I'm gonna jackknife
this fucker!

MUELLER
You'll kill us all, you son of a
bitch!
Sal slows down and pulls over a bit, lowers the window, and
flips the semi the bird as the truck passes them. Mueller
slaps the back of Sal's head.

MUELLER (CONT'D)
What the hell was all that?

Sal's loving this.

SAL
Seems like you're gonna hafta
either tighten up your mouth or
loosen up your collar.

Mueller tries to calm himself down. He's too steamed. He
takes off the collar.

EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - NIGHT 15

The car is parked in front of the cemetery on a drizzling
Sunday night.

SAL (0.S.)
Where're we supposed to go, Doc?

INT. SAL'S TAURUS - NIGHT 16

Doc shuffles through a pile of internet maps and papers.

DOC
Dover Air Force Base.
SAL
That's in fuckin Delaware.
DOC
Right. Dover, Delaware.
SAL
So why're we here?
DOC
I don't know.
SAL
You said Arlington.
DOC
That's what they said.
SAL
But now you're saying Dover.
DOC
Yeah, I guess first... Dover. They

got to fly in somewhere, so they
fly to Dover.

Sal looks behind at Mueller, who looks away.
SAL

All right, Doc. Dover it is. I'm
guessing you got a map.

Mueller, my man, my mauling
brother, can I axe you a personal
question?

SAL'S TAURUS - NIGHT - MOVING 18

drives. Sal is in the passenger seat while Mueller has

MUELLER
I suspect you're going to anyway,
and since I'm stuck here in the
backseat you might as well...

SAL
On a Saturday night, are you still
up to giving your wife a good fuck?

DOC
C'mon Sal, that's... that's...

SAL
What? I'm curious is all.

Mueller gives him an icy look.

MUELLER
I don't discuss my sex life. It's
called respect for your wife, but
you wouldn't know anything about
that.

SAL
Hold on, I respect your wife. Of
course I do. I only wanted to know
if you can still cut the mustard.
Just makin' conversation on how the
years have treated you.

Not taking the bait, Mueller just stares off into the night.

SAL (CONT'D)
Now, Doc here, you don't even have
to ask. He don't need no Viagra to
fly the flag, do you, Doc?

(CONTINUED)
26.

DOC
I haven't had sex in two years.

SAL
Holy shit - why the hell not?

DOC
My wife was sick.

MUELLER
(to Sal)
Weren't you even listening?

SAL
Yeah, but life goes on.
(beat)
Don't it?

MUELLER
Apparently.

SAL
Remember your first time?

DOC
I told Mary all about that. I
confessed to everything. I wanted
no secrets from her.

SAL
Now that's just plain stupid.
Never do that.

MUELLER
It was never about you getting
laid, Doc. It was about Sal getting
you laid.

SAL
Duh.

MUELLER
He had to show you a good time, and
he only knew his way. Ignorant
soul.

SAL
As I recall, you was there too,
partaking, how shall we say, fully.

MUELLER
Yes, and I didn't know any more
than you did what a good time was,
back in those days.

(CONTINUED)
19

19

27.

SAL
Those days? It hasn't changed
much. A little whorin', a little
drinkin', a little fightin', all
things in moderation.

MUELLER
Sounds like the recipe for a wasted
life.

SAL

At least it's bullshit-free.

MUELLER
You positive about that?

They fall silent, crossing the Severn River Bridge into
Delaware.

EXT. DOVER AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT 19

GATEHOUSE - the Taurus Wagon is parked off to the side as our
three wait while the AIR PATROL GUARD finishes a phone call.

INT. SAL'S TAURUS - NIGHT 19

DOC
Wonder if anything is wrong?

SAL
He's a guard at a gate - he don't
know nothing.

DOC
Wonder if there'll be an honor
guard and all that?

SAL
There'll be something - it'll be
respectful. It's just not public -
there's a blackout on all that
stuff this time around.

MUELLER
Yeah, no pictures of coffins, no
reminders to the public.

DOC
People should know. Don't they owe
it to the guys who've sacrificed?

MUELLER

People are so ready to believe in
anything once it's called a war.

(CONTINUED)
20

21

28.

SAL
Yep.

MUELLER
Call it war, you got their support.
War on drugs, war on crime... it's

all fake. War itself is fake.

Eventually the GUARD comes to the car, and makes the gesture
of rolling down the window.

GUARD
Gentlemen, the body is in transit.
The plane's not due 'til 0800
tomorrow. Come back then and you'll
be able to wait in the hangar.

DOC
Okay. Thank you.

SAL
In transit. Somebody's always in
transit, even...
EXT. KING'S COURT MOTOR LODGE - NIGHT 20
A cheerless refuge from the rain.
INT. KING'S COURT MOTOR LODGE FRONT DESK - NIGHT 21

The guys are in mid check-in.

MUELLER
I thought I'd have my own room.

SAL
Don't get cranky on us old man.

Doc takes cash out of his envelope.

SAL (CONT'D)
Whoa... what's with the wad?

DOC
They took up a collection at the
Exchange, when they heard.

SAL

See? You got lots of friends.
DOC

They felt bad. They wanted to do

something.

(CONTINUED)
22

29.

A HYPED-UP EMPLOYEE enters the front area and changes the
channel on the TV that rumbles in the background.

HYPED-UP EMPLOYEE
You guys aren't watching this?

DOC
What?

HYPED-UP EMPLOYEE
They got him!

SAL
Who?

HYPED-UP EMPLOYEE
That sumbitch Saddam! They got him
in a spider hole!

He finds a news station that is showing some footage of the
captured Saddam Hussein, submitting to an inspection of body,
etc.

INT. KING'S COURT MOTOR LODGE ROOM - NIGHT 22

Two queen beds, a TV going with the Hussein footage, and an
empty pizza box at the foot of the bed. Doc already looks
asleep, while Mueller lays on his bed, almost asleep.

SAL
How's the rack, Padre?

MUELLER
It's fine.

Here they are, but where are they? Nothing to do, nowhere to
go. Sal just finishes the last piece of pizza and stares at
more Saddam Hussein footage.

EXT. KING'S COURT MOTOR LODGE PARKING LOT - MORNING 23

They make their way to the car and throw their bags into the
trunk.

DOC
I was wondering...you never went
home, so how did you get to pack a
bag?

SAL
I always keep one in the trunk.
Sometimes a lady friend wants me to
stay over. I hate to say no.

(CONTINUED)
24

30.

MUELLER
Is there one particular lady friend
or are there more?

SAL
One at the moment, but I'm always
holding auditions.
(slams down the trunk)
Let's do this.

INT. HANGAR - MORNING 24

Cold and hollow and cheerless. A folding table has been set
up with coffee and doughnuts. Only Sal partakes. Across the
hangar is a MOTHER, weeping. Her eyes are red from crying.

She holds a hanky against her face. Her HUSBAND is a large

man, a working man, and he is angry.

MOTHER
(through tears)
I want him to look nice...

FATHER
Irene, that ain't gonna be the boy
that walked out of our house, that
waved good-bye.

Another circle of four - mother, father, second wife, second
husband - huddle together. One more circle of three waits - a
mother, father and daughter.

The hangar door slides open. An Army major and a Marine Lt.
Colonel come in. Behind them are four coffins, each on a
wagon, each covered with a flag and each with an enlisted man
escort.

They space out the coffins. The escorts stand at attention.
Our three move toward the Marine. The COLONEL steps forward.
He is ramrod straight, around 40, used to being feared. He
addresses Sal in a lower voice suitable to the occasion.

COLONEL
Mister Shepherd?

Sal nods to Doc, who stands dumbly, his eyes on the flag-
covered box that contains his son. The Colonel extends his
hand. Doc shakes it.

COLONEL (CONTâ€™D)
Mr. Shepherd, I'm Colonel Willits.
The President of the United States
has asked me to express his deep
regret that your son was killed in
action.

(CONTINUED)
Sal can't help himself and rolls his eyes.

DOC
Thank you.

COLONEL WILLITS
He died a hero in the service of
his country. He was an inspiration
to his fellow Marines.

31.

WASHINGTON, the escort, stands at stony attention. He is a
young black man, also a lance corporal. Something is wrong
with his ear lobe. It is covered with tiny bumps and looks
like it is rotting away. He is 20 and though taught to kill

he gives off a sense of basic goodness.

DOC
Can I see him?

COLONEL WILLITS
Sir, that would be ill-advised.
Trust me on this. You do not want
to see him like that.

DOC
I don't know... I think I have to.

COLONEL WILLITS
Sir, Lance Corporal Shepherd was
hit in the back of head. I can

assure you he felt no pain... but
the exit wound in such a case is
devastating... to the face.

DOC

They were behind him? They shot him
from behind?

MUELLER
Take the Colonel's advice, Doc.
Best to remember him as he was.

Doc thinks about it, looks to Sal.

SAL
I'd have to see him, but that's me.
The thing is, you don't have to
listen to no colonels no more.
Those days are gone.

The Colonel seems to recoil, his jaw tightens. Washington

sees it and twitches.

(CONTINUED)
32.

DOC
I'm gonna see my son.

COLONEL WILLITS
What you see you will not be able
to un-see.

DOC
I understand... but I have to.

COLONEL WILLITS
As you wish. Lance Corporal
Washington, escort these two
gentlemen to the coffee mess.

Washington leads them away. At the table, they turn and watch
Doc. Washington holds his attention stance.

SAL
Listen up, why don't you stand at
ease, you're givin' me a stiff
neck.

WASHINGTON
(relaxing)
Man, never heard anyone talk to the
Colonel like that.

SAL
Colonels don't scare me, kid. Never
have, never will.

WASHINGTON
You a Marine?

Sal slides up his sleeve and reveals his tattoo.

WASHINGTON (CONTâ€™D)
I thought so.

SAL
I got more time in the chow line
than you got in the corps.

WASHINGTON
(to Mueller)
You too?
MUELLER

Semper Fi, do or die. How do you
think I got this cane?

(CONTINUED)
33.

SAL
Hey kid. The fuck's wrong your
ear?
WASHINGTON
Baghdad boil.
SAL
Say what?
WASHINGTON

Baghdad boil. Everybody's got one.
You get bit by a teeny sand fly.
They say it'll go away. In a year
or two.

SAL
That's one ugly ear.

MUELLER
This is a big mistake.

They look at Doc, who braces himself, then buckles at the
knees when the coffin lid is lifted. Sal takes a step toward
him, but Mueller gently stops him with the crook of his cane.

MUELLER (CONT'D)
Nothing you can do now. Or do you
just want to out-tough a colonel?

SAL
I don't want nothin'. I'm just
along for the ride.

MUELLER
Yeah right.

WASHINGTON
So you were in 'Nam with Larry's
dad?

MUELLER
We were.

WASHINGTON
You know what happened back then?

SAL
Naw, we were just pullin' triggers,
killin' gooks.

WASHINGTON

His dad wound up doing brig time
behind it.

(CONTINUED)
34.

MUELLER
That's all in the past.
SAL
What do you know about that?
WASHINGTON
Sounded like he fucked up some
dudes... or some dudes fucked him

up.
(nobody says anything)
You them dudes?

MUELLER
What exactly did he tell you?

WASHINGTON
Only some bad shit went down. I was
Larry's best friend. No one else
knew anything about it.

SAL
You were with him in the ambush?
WASHINGTON
Ambush?
SAL
Yeah, an ambush and a fire fight,
they said.
WASHINGTON
Okay.
SAL
Okay?
WASHINGTON

If that's what they're saying it
was, then that's what it was.

SAL
You were there. What the hell
happened?

Washington hesitates.

SAL (CONT'D)
Spit it out, kid. It's just us,
Marine to Marine.

WASHINGTON
(nervous )
It was fucked.
(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
Me and Shepherd and three other
dudes were all day humping school
supplies. Tablets, pencils, some
new books. It was our last run,
pissed-off mode, sand down our
throats and up our asses. One guy
said he wished he was in the
fuckin' Navy. We started dissin'
swabbies, calling them chickens of
the sea, shit like that. Then Shep
says, my old man was a swabby, a
medical corpsman, wound up with the
Marines in 'Nam. I asked him how
long he put in, and Shepherd says
about five years, but a couple of
them in the brig. Anyway, we was
always stoppin' at this little
store we called Abdul's Haji Mart
for Haji Cokes. It was my turn to
make the run but Shep said he'd do
it. So he gets out and we're
bullshitting. Then this raghead
comes up behind him, shouts out Ala
Akbar or whatever, you know, God is
great, and then he puts a cap in
Shep's head.

This sinks in.

SAL
What happened next?

WASHINGTON
Shit man, we went off. Lit â€˜em all
up - that raghead, Abdul, and damn
near the whole fuckin' hood.

Sal and Mueller just take this in.

WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
We carried Larry back to the Hummer
and went home. Fuck a whole bunch
of school supplies.

SAL
He's supposed to get a Bronze Star
behind this.

WASHINGTON
Oh, he'll get the Star. The more
Stars the better, right?

They look over at Doc as the Colonel lowers the coffin lid.

Doc still braces himself against it.

(CONTINUED)
36.

MUELLER

We can't tell him about this.
SAL

We can't?
MUELLER

Let him have his Bronze Star, his
burial at Arlington with honors.
Let him have his hero. Lord knows
he's had little enough in his life.

SAL

You mean, let him have the lie?
MUELLER

Yes. What's more important?
SAL

I don't know, but it's never the

lie.

Sal walks toward the coffin, toward Doc and the Colonel.
Mueller trails behind, slowed by his cane. Washington takes
Mueller's arm and they move a little faster that way. As they
get closer, they can overhear the Colonel.

COLONEL WILLITS
I'm sorry sir, but there is always
a sound reason for my
recommendations.

Doc is trembling, unable to speak. Sal puts a hand on his
shoulder. Doc goes into his arms. Sal holds him awkwardly.
These men are not used to hugs. He pats his back.

DOC
Sal... he don't have a face
anymore.

All Sal can offer is the universal spine stiffener, God's
blessing and curse combined:

SAL
Gotta be a man.

Doc nods into his shoulder and stands back, running a
handkerchief over his face. Sal takes a moment to stare down
the Colonel.

SAL (CONT'D)

How'd this boy wind up dead,
mister?

(CONTINUED)
37.

MUELLER
Sal...

COLONEL WILLITS
I beg your pardon?

SAL
Simple question. How'd it happen?

COLONEL WILLITS
The Lance Corporal acquitted
himself with dignity and honor, and
he died a hero.

SAL
Yeah, well, they're all heroes,
ain't they?

COLONEL WILLITS
That they are, sir.

SAL
All heroes, for sure. But how did
it happen that he was shot in the
back of his head, like a fuckin'
dog?

Doc looks at the uneasy Colonel through teary eyes.

COLONEL WILLITS
He was a brave Marine, a credit to
the corps, and he served his
country well.

SAL
So did we all - all of us here. And
we still have to when we get the

chance.
DOC
What's going on, Sal?
SAL
I don't know. That's why I'm
askin'.
MUELLER

Shouldn't we be making arrangements
for the funeral. Isn't that why
we're here?

SAL
Were you there, when it happened?

(CONTINUED)
25

38.

COLONEL WILLITS
No, I wasn't.

SAL
Where were you?

COLONEL WILLITS
With all due respect, that's none
of your business.

SAL
With all due respect, Doc here
ought to get to talk to somebody
who was. You weren't.
(to Washington)
Were you?

Washington hesitates, glances at the Colonel staring at him,
but then reluctantly answers.

WASHINGTON
I was there, sir.

The Colonel doesn't like how this is going at all, but it's
too late.

COLONEL WILLITS
Very well. Lance Corporal
Washington, tell him what happened.

Washington takes a deep breath.

LATER - Sal is at the coffee table. Mueller approaches fror?5
the hangar door. Doc is leaning back against the coffin,
considering what to do. The Colonel and Washington stand on
either side of him.

MUELLER
Where are we with this?

SAL
Where we was, pretty much. He'd
like his son's face back.

MUELLER
I called my wife. I'm going home.
I'll take the bus.

SAL
You quittin'?

MUELLER
Quitting what?

(CONTINUED)
39.

SAL
We'll know in a minute or two.

Sal sees the Colonel once again approaching Doc so he wanders
over to him.

SAL (CONT'D)
Yo, Doc.

Doc looks up.

SAL (CONT'D)
What's it gonna be here?

Doc stands up straight, looks the Colonel in the eye.

DOC
I can't bury him in Arlington. Not
now.

COLONEL WILLITS
He qualifies and he deserves that
honor.

Doc digs out his wallet, rifles through it, and produces a
photo of his son. He holds it out, in front of the Colonel's
face.

DOC

Here, this is what his face looked
like. He was a good-looking boy.

(shows the photo to the

others)
See? The high school girls were all
over him. He was a good-looking
boy. I'm taking Larry home.

COLONEL WILLITS
I assure you that is a bad decision
and you will come to regret it.

Doc tries to push the cart. Sal hands his cup to Mueller and
joins him. They push together.

COLONEL WILLITS (CONT'D)
Hold on. The Marines will transport
the body, at no cost to you,
anywhere you choose.

They keep on pushing.

(CONTINUED)
26

40.

COLONEL WILLITS (CONT'D)
Gentlemen. I cannot release the
Lance Corporal's body, except to a
licensed mortician...

Mueller steps up.

MUELLER
Or to a clergyman, isn't that the
case?

The Colonel hesitates, as Mueller hands him Sal's cup and
begins to put on his clerical collar.

COLONEL WILLITS
Correct.

MUELLER
So I guess that would be me.

Using his cane, Mueller walks behind Doc and Sal as they push
the coffin. Washington stands next to the Colonel, impressed.

EXT. HANGAR PARKING LOT â€”- MORNING 26

Sal and Doc push the cart, Mueller trailing behind. They come
to a stop, not before dinging the car.

DOC
Sorry about that.

SAL
Forget about it.

They stand silently, awkwardly for a moment. What now?

MUELLER
Now how you gonna get him home?
Strap that coffin to the roof of
Sal's car?

SAL
We could do that. We'd need help
liftin' it up. Maybe we...

MUELLER
Don't be ridiculous.

SAL
Why not? Tell me a better way to
be. You wish you could be
ridiculous, but it's too late now.

(CONTINUED)
41.

MUELLER
Doc, let the government take care
of the transport - that's the kinda
thing they're good at.

DOC
I don't like the government right
now.

MUELLER

You don't have to.

DOC
I don't trust it any more.

SAL
Hell, we could rent a truck.

DOC
Yeah, let's do that. We'll stay
here, and you can take the car and
go find a truck. Pay for it out of
this.

Doc gives him an envelope full of cash.

SAL
Consider it done. One truck,
comin' up.

MUELLER
(to Doc)
I'll be going with Sal. He can
drop me at the bus station. I
think I'll be going back home now.

For a moment no one says anything.

DOC
I understand, Mueller. I'm sorry
for dragging you up here.

MUELLER
I thought I could be of some help.
I thought we were going to a
funeral.

SAL
We ARE going to a funeral, it just
looks like it's going to take a
little longer to get there.

Doc doesn't want to make this any harder than it is.

(CONTINUED)
27

42.

DOC
It's okay, Mueller. I'm just glad
I got to see you again.

MUELLER
I'm sorry, lad.

A handshake and a hug, awkwardly trapping his cane against
him.

MUELLER (CONT'D)
Glad I got to see you too. God
bless you, Doc.

INT. SAL'S TAURUS - DAY - MOVING 27

Sal drives, Mueller next to him. They maintain a silence,
then -

MUELLER
We should stop and ask somebody
where the bus station is.

SAL
It's a small town, we'll run into
it. Give you a few more minutes to
enjoy my company.

MUELLER
Always a pleasure.

SAL
Before you bail on us.

Mueller stares straight ahead.

SAL (CONT'D)
So, what's on your agenda? Read the
bible all the way home, leftover
ham for supper, say a little
prayer...

MUELLER
Oh, I'll say a little prayer long
before that. The bigger question
is, what's on your agenda?

SAL
I feel I owe him one. Nothin' more,
nothin' less.

MUELLER

Even though he says you don't owe
him a thing?

(CONTINUED)
28

43.

SAL
All the more reason.
MUELLER
What would have happened, way back
then, if we hadn't... you know?
SAL

Doc wouldn't have ended up doing
two years in the brig, that's for
sure. And we wouldn't have had to
see what we did.

MUELLER
What was that?
SAL
You don't remember?
MUELLER
I remember a lot of shit... what

are you talking about?

SAL
A certain platoon buddy, shot,
writhing around on the ground
dying, with nothing to help him
cause we'd taken all the morphine
for ourselves.

MUELLER
He was going to die, anyway. He
had no chance. Minutes.

SAL
Maybe.

MUELLER
There was nothing we could do at
that point.

SAL
Yeah, and we did nothin'. Sometimes
you ought to do a little more.

Sal sees a Ryder agency and pulls to the curb.
INT. U-HAUL RENTAL AGENCY - DAY 28

A nervous older WOMAN, smoking a cigarette, is behind the
counter, dealing with Sal and Mueller.

(CONTINUED)
44,

WOMAN
I have a van that would work for
you, but you might be happier with
a truck that's got a hydraulic tail

lift.
SAL
Ohhh, a hydraulic lift. I like it.
WOMAN
What will you be hauling?
SAL
(hesitates)
Your truck with the lift'll handle
it.
WOMAN

Will you be dropping it off back
here or at another location?

It catches Sal short. He hadn't thought about that.

WOMAN (CONTâ€™D)
Don'tcha know?

SAL
Guess I'm gonna return it here.

WOMAN
And when will that be?

Again, Sal has to think about it. The agent's suspicions
start to grow. She grows more nervous. Terrorists?

WOMAN (CONTâ€™D)
You don't know how long you'll need
it?

SAL
Better give me a week.

MUELLER
Oh my, a week, he says.

Now she looks uneasily at Mueller as she taps her keyboard.
SAL
Now Mueller, it's outta your hands

now.

At "Mueller," the agent's head jerks slightly, not sure what
she heard.

(CONTINUED)
45.

SAL (CONT'D)
... Just have a seat and take a
load off. I'll handle this.

Mueller makes his way to a chair and sits. The woman is
fretting inwardly.

WOMAN
I need to see your driver's
license.

SAL

Yes, ma'am.

He empties one pocket of change and keys and a cigar cutter.
The woman looks at that with apprehension. Out of the other
pocket: cash, cards and hard candy. He finds the license.

WOMAN
Norfolk, Virginia?

SAL
Gotta live somewhere.

WOMAN
What brings you up here?

SAL
With all due respect, that's none
of your business.

Now she's really worried.

WOMAN
Just trying to be friendly.

SAL
Really? Okay. Well, I'm here
because of a death in the family.

WOMAN
I'm sorry.
SAL
(smiling)
That's all right. It wasn't my
family.

WOMAN
Will you be the only driver?

Again, he has to think about it.

(CONTINUED)
SAL
I'll have some help.

WOMAN
Then I'll need to see the other
driver's license. Is it that
gentleman there?

SAL
His holiness? His holiness can't

hardly walk, let alone handle a big
rig with a hydraulic lift.

WOMAN
Whoever, I'll need their license.

SAL
I'll drive it myself.

WOMAN
So you are the only driver?

SAL
Yes, ma'am. I be the wheelman.

Paranoia deepens.

WOMAN
Insurance on the vehicle?

SAL
What about it?

WOMAN
Would you like to get some?

SAL
Not necessary.

WOMAN
How will you be paying?

SAL
Cash.

He pulls out Doc's brown envelope.

MUELLER
And get directions.

SAL
Oh, yeah, where's the bus station?

She can't wait to call the police.
47.

29 EXT. STREET/INT. U-HAUL TRUCK - DAY - MOVING 29
Sal and Mueller are driving along in the rented truck.

SAL
Sixteen or sixty, put a dude behind
the wheel of a big rig, got to feel
like hot shit.

MUELLER
It's a rented U-Haul with an
automatic transmission.

SAL
Bigger than anything you ever
handled.

MUELLER

Look Sal, Doc's boy is dead. Try
not to forget that.

SAL
I haven't forgotten that. But
we're still alive, right? With
time tickin' fast away. If a minute
comes up that's not too terrible,
I'm gonna try to enjoy it. You used
to be up for some fun.

MUELLER
Still am.
SAL
Really?!
MUELLER
As long it's right in God's eyes.
SAL
â€˜God's eyes?' God don't have no
eyes.
MUELLER

Oh, He's got eyes. And ears too. He
hears every insult you send His
way. There will be a reckoning,
Sergeant.

SAL
A reckoning?

MUELLER
I assure you of that.

(CONTINUED)
48.

SAL
Then great - then I reckon I'll
take that opportunity to stand at
attention and say to God, "Hey,
where were You when they were
rapin' children or with the
genocide and all that? Where were
You when they flew airplanes into
buildings, killin' thousands of
folks just goin' to work, and the
murderers shouting Your name, or
You by some other name. Same
difference. Where were You when
Doc's kid was buyin' Cokes and some
raghead blew his face off?" You
see, I ain't gonna explain myself
to God, I'm gonna make Him explain
Himself to me!

MUELLER
I'm going to pray for your soul.

SAL
And I'm bettin' at the end of it,
if the fucker even exists he'll say
"Get your ass in here, you're my
kind of dude."

(beat)

At least that's what I'm hopin'. If
He's a tight-ass God, I'm fucked.

MUELLER
It might be time for a lube job on
that plate you got in your head.

SAL
Don't fuck with my plate, it's
pickin' up WOR in New York.

Mueller just stares at him. Sal notices the radio.

SAL (CONT'D)
Looky here.

He turns it on. Rap music. An Eminem song (something from
"The Eminem Show").

MUELLER
Turn that shit off.

SAL
(he doesn't)
You've heard this stuff, right?
(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
49,

SAL (CONT'D)
Now, I've been known to get ina
face or two, but even I find some
of this stuff offensive. And damn
hard to dance to...

MUELLER
For once you and I agree on
something.

SAL

Don't it make you a little ashamed
to be an African American?

MUELLER
No, not really.

SAL
Well, it ought to, dignified old
gentleman like you, who'd be the
first to agree just how far this
stuff is from Motown.

MUELLER
Why should I feel ashamed? This
dude is white.

The fuck ...!?

MUELLER
That's affirmative. White as rice.

SAL
That's comin' out of a white mouth?

MUELLER
Yep - a white sewer mouth.

SAL
Then, by God, fuck me. I ought to
feel ashamed myself. Only I never
did much identify with the white
race.

MUELLER
Oh really? Now I'm curious. What
race do you identify with?

SAL
Green. The corps - that was the
only culture ever made any sense to
me.
(beat)
You ever miss it?

(CONTINUED)

MUELLER
Not for a minute.

SAL
I don't believe you.

30 INT. BUS STATION - DAY 30

Sal carries Mueller's bag and waits while Mueller hobbles
back with his ticket in hand.

SAL
No problem?

MUELLER
Not unless being stuck on a bus for
the next seven hours is a problem.

SAL
Busses are real nice now.
Recliners, a shitter in the back.
Maybe you'll meet some poor redneck
and save his soul. How many points
you get for that? Is it a point
system?

MUELLER
I'm just hoping I can sleep. I
didn't sleep too well last night.

SAL
Me either. Remember when we could
sleep in a hole in the ground, with
bullets zinging just overhead?

MUELLER
You can't go back, Sal.

SAL
Who'd want to?

MUELLER
We can't redo the choices we made
back then. All we can do is learn
from them and try to do better in
the future.

SAL
Yeah, I know that.

MUELLER
But you're still gonna do it,
aren't you?

(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
51.

MUELLER (CONT'D)
You're gonna take Doc and his dead
son to Portsmouth and try to make
it fun.

SAL
You ought to come with.

MUELLER
Can't do that.

SAL
All right. Well, I'd better get
started.

He extends his hand and they share an affectionate shake.

SAL (CONT'D)
I still can't believe it, you of
all people, a preacher.

MUELLER
Goddam right.

SAL
Think we'll ever bump into each
other again? We're not that far

away.
MUELLER
Never know. He moves in mysterious
ways.
EXT. HANGAR - DAY 31

The back of the parked truck is open and Doc pushes the
coffin up to it as Sal joins him.

DOC
This is a lot of truck.
SAL
Never go small, kid. Check this

out.

He pulls a small lever and raises the lift up to the level of
the coffin. Together they half-slide, half-lift it off the
wagon and onto the lift. Sal leans back against the lift and
lights a cigar.

SAL (CONT'D)

I was wondering, though. What would
your kid have wanted?

(CONTINUED)
32

33

52.

Doc thinks about it for a beat.

DOC
To drink beer with his friends.
Chase girls. He was twenty-one, he
wasn't thinking about dying.

SAL
You can make this a lot easier on
yourself.

DOC
I don't want to make it easier on
myself.

SAL
(chuckles )
Yeah. Guys like you and me, we
take all the shit â€˜til it's
disaster, and then we're cool, the
worst has happened, like we always
knew it would.

DOC
They sent him to a God-forsaken
desert because... who knows why?

It wasn't to protect America.

It's like that jungle they sent us
to. It wasn't a threat to us. And
then they sent him back to me in
this, with more lies... a hero,
honors, Arlington. I ain't going to
bury no Marine. I gotta bury a son.

EXT. HANGAR - DAY 32

Washington stands outside the hangar, watching the U-Haul
truck pull away, wistfully. Then he walks away.

INT. U-HAUL TRUCK - DAY - MOVING 33
Sal drives toward the gate.

SAL
Some rig, huh?

Doc doesn't answer but is looking out the window. Something's
wrong. A DAFB Police Car pulls in front of them, slows,
bringing them almost to a stop. Another Police Car blocks
them from behind, trapping them. They come to a stop.

BULLHORN VOICE (0.S.)
Get out of the truck. Walk away,
hands above your head.
34

53.

INT. BUS STATION - DAY 34

Mueller sits in the waiting area, quietly reading his bible.
A man in a cheap RAINCOAT is talking to the ticket agent,
looking over at Mueller. Another man in a black ANORAK takes
a seat next to him.

ANORAK
Taking a bus today?

MUELLER
Yes, to Richmond. And you?

ANORAK
Richmond, huh. That home for you?

MUELLER
No, but it's getting close. Why?

Cheap Raincoat has walked over and is standing in front of
Mueller.

RAINCOAT
You're the one they call the
Mullah?

MUELLER
The what?

RAINCOAT
Mullah.

MUELLER
I'm waiting for a bus to Richmond,
reading the scriptures.

ANORAK
What, the Bible? Checking out the
competition?

MUELLER
Who are you two? What do you want
from me?

ANORAK
That depends.

RAINCOAT
We're from Homeland Security.

MUELLER
What?!
35

54.

INT. KING'S COURT MOTOR LODGE ROOM - NIGHT 35

Sal crushes an empty Bud can and tosses it the length of the
room, missing the basket. As he grabs for a fresh one, Doc
retrieves the empty and deposits it on top of the others in
the plastic-lined wastebasket of the very same room they
occupied the night before. Sal pops another can.

SAL
It used to mean something. There
used to be an esprit de corps, a
unity, a well-earned pride, some
goddamn common sense. I don't know
what it means anymore.

DOC
Fuck 'em. Fuck â€˜em all.

SAL
Fuck â€˜em all! I spent the best
years of my life defendin' this
country.

DOC
I think your best years are still
ahead of you, Sal.

SAL
Fuck you.

DOC
It's true. It can be true.

SAL
Will you sit the fuck down? Look at
me - all my future is behind me. I
got a scrambled brain held together
with a steel plate. And they look
at me and what do they see? A
fuckin' terrorist!

DOC
An apology would have been nice.

SAL
Oh they're sorry. Sorry they didn't
smoke our asses.

A KNOCK on the door. They look at each other, like, what now?
Sal eventually shrugs his shoulders and Doc cautiously opens
the door. Mueller steps in and drops his bag. He stares down
Sal. Sal gets off the bed he's been sitting on, Mueller's
bed. He smooths it, and steps aside. Mueller lies down in his
overcoat.

(CONTINUED)
55.

SAL (CONT'D)
You forget your toothbrush?

Mueller says nothing. He needs a moment. Then -

MUELLER
I called my wife from the police
station. The damn police station.
Only after they decided I was not a
Muslim radical. And not a mullah,
but an old preacher named Mueller.

Sal thinks this is hilarious.

SAL
Mullah the Mauler! Its all over -
this country's fucked.

DOC
Was Ruth upset?

MUELLER
Oh yeah, she wanted me to come
right home. But I told her that
when times demand it, even old men
should become threats.

SAL
(interrupting)
Fuckin' A right it is! It's like
during the pinko scare....

MUELLER
(icily)
I believe I was talking.

Sal raises his hands - sorry and continue.

MUELLER (CONT'D)
I told my wife I was not coming
home until we were done. Where's
your boy?

DOC
They've got him again.

MUELLER
Tomorrow we get him back and take
him home.
56.

36 INT. KING'S COURT MOTOR LODGE DESK - MORNING 36

Our three come into the lobby and are met by the Lt. Colonel
and Washington.

COLONEL WILLITS
Good morning, gentlemen.

SAL
What's the deal, colonel whatever
your name is - where's Larry?

COLONEL WILLITS
Willits. Colonel Willits. I've been
briefed on last night's snafu.
Totally ridiculous, the rental
agent apparently went off the deep
end, but there it is and what's
done is done.

He addresses Doc.

COLONEL WILLITS (CONT'D)
I hope, given further time for
reflection, that you can see that
Arlington is a resting place that
should not be refused in anger.
There lie heroes. The details of
the Lance Corporal's death are what
they are, but make no mistake: his
death was heroic. He was in a
foreign and hostile land doing the
decent thing. He deserves to lie
beneath the sacred soil of
Arlington. He would want that. I
urge you to choose that for him.

DOC
Thank you. I'm gonna take my son
home and bury him in New Hampshire.
Not in his uniform. I'm going to
bury him in his graduation suit.

COLONEL WILLITS
As you wish. Your government will
fly the coffin, at no expense to
you, to Portsmouth and a funeral
director of your choice.

DOC
No, we're taking him with us now.

(CONTINUED)
57.

COLONEL WILLITS
With all due respect, you're
cutting off your nose to spite your
face.

SAL
Take a look at these faces. Think
any of them care about your fuckin'
opinions? With all due respect.

DOC
We can go by train.

They all kind of look at each other for a moment and arrive
at a consensual "why not?"

COLONEL WILLITS

Okay, I'll make the arrangements.

(punches out a number on

his cell phone)
Lance Corporal Washington here will
be going with you.

(in phone)
Colonel Willits here. You are going
to make a few things happen, ASAP.

SAL
Hold on, Colonel, we don't need no
babysitter.
COLONEL WILLITS
(in phone)
Stand by.
(to Sal)

I wasn't implying you did.
Washington's on TDY, escort duty.
You don't want him, he goes right
back to Baghdad.

DOC
Guys?

MUELLER
We could use the help.

SAL
Does he pull per diem?

COLONEL WILLITS
Of course.

Sal grins at Washington.

(CONTINUED)
37

58.

SAL
Then fall in, Washington!
(to Colonel)
But he takes his orders from us.

COLONEL WILLITS
He takes his orders from ME. But,
he will accommodate you in any
reasonable way you ask, because I
just ordered him to. Is that
clear?

SAL
Well, you're a fuckin' force of
nature, ain't you? It would have
been fun to run into you in the
field in my younger days.

COLONEL WILLITS
You think so?

SAL
One of us woulda got fragged.

INT. HANGAR - MORNING 37

Everybody is back at the hangar where the casket has been
taken. They see six more flag-draped coffins being wheeled
into the hangar. Their casket is loaded onto one carryall
while the civilians pull away in another. Sal turns back to
see Washington, in the distance, standing at attention with
the Colonel in his face.

COLONEL WILLITS
I don't give a fuck what they say.
The Lance Corporal is ours. He's a
Marine until he goes into the
ground, and he remains a Marine for
the period he is under the ground,
plus one hundred years. I will not
have three over-the-hill veterans
pissing on my corps. Is that
understood?

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir!

COLONEL WILLITS
You're a Marine, and your mission
is to see your brother home. You're
in charge, and when IN charge, TAKE
charge. Understood?

(CONTINUED)
59.

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir!

COLONEL WILLITS
There's going to be a mortuary
affairs detail at every step of the
trip. You will protect the dignity
of that dead Marine, and see that
he is buried with honors. In his
uniform. Not in some pussy civilian
graduation suit! Understood?

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir!

COLONEL WILLITS
And don't let that Sal asshole
outflank you. He's old but he's
dangerous. Don't let that happen -
kill him first.

WASHINGTON
Sir?

COLONEL WILLITS
That is not an order.

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir.

COLONEL WILLITS
And just because that crippled
preacher reminds you of your
father, don't trust him.

WASHINGTON
I never knew my father, sir.

COLONEL WILLITS
Lance Corporal, do you have a
personal problem?

WASHINGTON
No, sir!

COLONEL WILLITS
Then get on it.

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir!

He jumps into the other carryall and it takes off.
38

EXT./INT. RAILROAD STATION - DAY 38

Alongside the train at the Wilmington, Delaware station, the
"mortuary detail" of six service members, including
Washington, carry the box containing the coffin. They
eventually load the container onto a cargo car. Washington
stands next to it in the car and salutes, as do the other
five, before walking away. Doc stands back a little as Sal
chats with the attendant, JOHN REDMAN, who also saluted.

REDMAN
I was there the first time. Gulf
War, they called it then.

SAL
You got back.

REDMAN
Yeah, and I'm not pissin' blood and
my babies are all okay. Filthy
little war. But righteous.

SAL
Oh yeah...

REDMAN
Can't let the big ones swallow up
the little ones.

Redman turns to Doc and shakes his hand.

REDMAN (CONT'D)
John Redman. Don't worry - I'll
look after your boy.

INT. TRAIN - DAY - MOVING 39

Sal and Doc sit next to each other, facing Mueller, who's
reading his bible. Sal watches him read.

SAL
When did you become so old?

MUELLER
I think it happened over the past
thirty years. Same as you.

SAL
I categorically deny it.

MUELLER
You can deny it all you want to,
but that ain't gonna stop the clock
or turn it back.

(CONTINUED)
61.

SAL
What do you make of that grunt,
Washington?

MUELLER
What about him?

SAL
I don't know, he don't say much,
him and his Baghdad boil... that's
some gnarly shit.

MUELLER
What do you want to know about him?

SAL
I don't want to know nothin' about
him.

MUELLER
Sounds to me like he is an
individual heavy on your mind.

SAL
Nothin' heavy about it. Just
wonderinâ€™.

MUELLER

Go back and talk to him, if he's
such a mystery to you.

SAL
Everything's a mystery to me...
except you.

MUELLER
Please.

SAL
I think I'll go back and talk to
him.

MUELLER
I'm sure he'll enjoy that.

DOC
Tell him he can come sit up here
with us.

SAL

I'll do an invite.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - MOVING 40

Alone in the restroom, Sal takes a toke on a joint, waving
away the smoke.

INT. CARGO CAR - DAY - MOVING 41

Sal enters, slowly walking over to Washington, sitting next
to the coffin.

SAL
You're welcome.

WASHINGTON
For what?

SAL
Are you on a train in Baghdad? No,
you're not.

Washington just kind of nods as Sal finds a seat on some
boxes.

SAL (CONT'D)
TDY. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes
it's a bitch.

WASHINGTON
I don't mind. He was my best
friend.

SAL

You didn't hang with the brothers?
Washington looks up at him.

WASHINGTON
There's no rule. I just liked the
dude. He had my back and I had his.
He was honest, said what he
thought. Simple, in a good way. He
never had an attitude.

SAL
Sounds a lot like his father.

WASHINGTON
What about the honest part?

SAL
Doc is not a dishonest man.

WASHINGTON
What about that brig time?

(CONTINUED)

EXT. /INT.

The train

SAL
That could have been any of us. He
got fucked. I know things you
don't.

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir.

SAL
Doc was a lot younger than us, a
kid, and technically he was in the
Navy. He wanted to be our friend
and we took advantage of it. We'd
done him a favor and now he was
doing one for us. But then it all
went to shit and someone had to
take the fall. C'mon up with us for
a while. Redman here will look
after your friend.

REDMAN
No problem.
WASHINGTON
That's all right.
SAL
No, you have to get out of here for
a while.
WASHINGTON
Why?
SAL

Come talk to Larry's father, say
something nice.

WASHINGTON
I don't know what I can say.

SAL
You'll come up with something.

PHILADELPHIA STATION - AFTERNOON 42

CONDUCTOR (V.O.)

Philadelphia... Arriving
Philadelphia.

INT. TRAIN CAR - AFTERNOON 43

Washington sits with the others, a bit uncomfortable. They
look out the window at the people on the platform, waiting
for the train, carrying shopping bags. Finally -

SAL
Look at them.

DOC
Who?

SAL

Them. All the shit they bought.
They don't have a clue.

MUELLER
Ordinary people, out for a day of
shopping.
SAL
Fuckin' sheep is what they are.
WASHINGTON
I wouldn't mind being one of them.
SAL
Well, yeah, it's better than being
shot at.
WASHINGTON

Rather be fighting them over there
than in our own backyard.

SAL
Sound familiar?

MUELLER
Oh yeah...

SAL

(to Washington)
See, we fought the commies in 'Nam
so we wouldn't have to fight them
on the beaches of Malibu.

WASHINGTON
Guess it worked.
(a beat)
Marine's gotta be willing to die on
order.

(CONTINUED)
65.

SAL
Yep - that's always been the
mission, and it's a bunch of crap.

MUELLER
There needs to be a reason. This
time we were told there was an
imminent danger. Arsenals of
horrible weapons... a possible
mushroom cloud.

SAL
Lies. It's always the same ol'
shit: stay the course, if we pull
out now, our heroes will have died
in vain...

MUELLER
But I want to believe in our
leaders, I want to believe in our
country. We're a good country.

SAL
Yes we are, but when you catch your
government lying to you, everything
changes.

Passengers hurry on board. The doors shut and the train pulls
away.

SAL (CONT'D)
So, how's the living over there?

WASHINGTON
It's all right. They got a shopping
mall out near the airport. There's
a new Burger King and Pizza Hut.
We're livin' pretty good for a
combat zone, but they sure hate us.

SAL
We gotta be the only occupying
force in histroy that expects
people to like us.

WASHINGTON
When you go out, you never know
what's gonna happen. But coming
from Oakland, I'm used to people
dying all of a sudden.

DOC
Really?

(CONTINUED)
66.

WASHINGTON
In high school, one of my best
friends was killed by a stray
bullet. My father was robbed on the
street, and they put one in him.
But I didn't even know who he was
â€˜til he turned up dead.

SAL
Jesus, kid...

WASHINGTON
I'm only sayinâ€™...

SAL
So you joined the Marines to get
away from all that in Oakland?

WASHINGTON
No, sir. I wanted to strengthen my
character. It was that way with
Larry too. We wanted to test
ourselves, to forge ourselves into
the men we wanted to become.

SAL
That's what we used to think.
Every generation has their war.
Men make wars, and wars make men...
Never gonna end.

MUELLER
Maybe we need to try something
else.

DOC

When Larry was little, he played
with toy soldiers. He dug trenches
for them. He put them through basic
training.

WASHINGTON
Mr. Shepherd, Larry was where he
wanted to be. He hated it. We all
hate it. But it's where we were
sent, and we'll do what we have to
do. We signed up for it.

DOC
He must have been embarrassed, me
sitting out the last part of our
war in the brig...

(CONTINUED)
67.

WASHINGTON
No, sir, Larry wasn't embarrassed -
he loved you. You know what made
him different from most of us in

the unit?

DOC
What?

WASHINGTON
He had a happy childhood.

DOC
He said that?

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir. He had a mother and
father who loved him... and each
other. Nice house to live in. Good
food to eat. School... football...
nice friends... on and on.

(beat)
Mr. Shepherd, it was my turn to get
the Cokes. That was my bullet, not
Larry's. I should have been the
one...

Mueller puts his hand on Washington's knee, letting him know
it's okay and not to think like that.

DOC
A gray car pulled up to the
house... a Marine Lieutenant and a

Navy chaplain. Shiny brass belt
buckles. I kept looking at those
shiny buckles. "The President has
asked me to express his deep
regret..." Killed in action. In
action - nothing about shot in the
back of the head buying Cokes for
the guys. Nothing about killed
trying to get the Baghdad school
system up and running.

(looks out the window,

looks back)
The school system in New Hampshire
is in rough shape.

(beat)
Why wasn't Larry back in New
Hampshire delivering stuff to our
own schools?

Nobody can say anything.

DOC (CONT'D)
Is that a stupid question?

INT. CAFE CAR - NIGHT - MOVING 44

With two glasses of beer, Sal wanders from the bar over to
the table where Doc and Mueller sit. Mueller has a cup of
coffee, and Doc a beer. As soon as Sal sits he downs a glass
in one gulp.

MUELLER
Thirsty?

SAL
Huh?

MUELLER

That went down awfully fast.

SAL
Well I'm drinking for two, now that
you've got all old and boring.

He starts to drink the other glass.

MUELLER
Might be you're an alcoholic. I am.
I recognized that and owned up to
it. That's the first step.

SAL
At least we're not drug addicts.

MUELLER
Not anymore, praise Jesus.

SAL
We never were.

MUELLER
We took the shit, didn't we?

SAL
We needed the shit.

MUELLER
If we needed it the corps would
have issued it to us.

SAL
In a way they did.

(CONTINUED)
45

DOC
That shit was meant for pain. All
drugs are.

SAL
So what's wrong with takin 'em
then?

MUELLER
Morphine? It's kind of addictive.

SAL
So's pain.

DOC
We weren't the ones who were in
pain, though.

SAL
The fuck we weren't.

MUELLER
That's a different kind of pain.

SAL
Pain is pain.

SAL (CONT'D)
Back from the war less than a day,
his best buddy in a coffin, and all
he's talking about is a Burger King
and Pizza Hut at the shopping mall.

DOC
He just doesn't want to talk about
it. We never did.

MUELLER
You asked him.
(new thought)
Next stop I need to call Ruth.

SAL
You need one of those mobile
phones. You could be talking to her
right now. Ten year-old kids have
â€˜em. They've practically quit
making pay phones.

SAL
I got your metaphoricals -
dangling! Stick to the story!

WASHINGTON
Wait a minute. They got a
Disneyland in Vietnam?

Everybody laughs.

MUELLER
That's what they called all the
bars and houses of ill-repute that
sprung up near the base.

SAL
And it was the company fucking
commander's doing! He's the one
who told us to take a couple of
days off and get Doc's ass over to
Disneyland before he had a total
meltdown.

DOC
I was having some problems...

SAL
He sure as shit was, and the
biggest one was that it was time
for him to get his cherry busted.
How old were you, Washington, first
time?

WASHINGTON
Thirteen.

SAL
I rest my fucking case! My point
exactly. Doc was eighteen.

DOC
I was nineteen.

(CONTINUED)
71.

SAL
One year worse. It was time.

DOC
No, it wasn't. The right time was
when I met Mary, and we committed
to each other.

MUELLER
I think thirteen is way too early,
too, by the way.

SAL
Don't wreck my story. Believe me
kid, he was ready. We killed some
time in the bars then found the
perfect little whorehouse.

WASHINGTON
That's so uncool.

SAL
What?

WASHINGTON

Paying for sex. Whores and pimps...
it's disgusting.

SAL
Jesus, what the hell has happened
to your basic GI?

WASHINGTON
I just think some things shouldn't
to be bought and sold.

DOC
Actually, it wasn't all that bad.

The others laugh. Mueller leans a little toward Washington.

MUELLER
Jesus had not yet entered my life.
I yielded to bad impulses.

SAL
Yielded to 'em? You smoked â€˜em,
drank â€˜em, and fucked every
impulse! Old Mueller the Mauler
here would get the five dollars/
five minute special - he was like a
jackrabbit.

Sal makes a quick humping motion. Mueller fights a smile.

MUELLER
Everything seems funny years later,

it was a dereliction of duty, pure
and simple.

SAL
I got your dir'liction swinging,
you old coot!

WASHINGTON
The whores I know, I don't want to
be around.

DOC
But this was like going to a
friend's house... and then you end

up having sex with the friend. And
then you pay them.

They laugh again. In spite of everything, they are having a
good time... a good moment at least.

SAL
Next day, I gotta admit, I was sick
of hearing about that little Asian
whore. Oh, Doc was quite proud of
himself. Said he had a hard-on so
big he couldn't bend his fingers or
blink his eyes.

Another round of big laughs.
SAL (CONT'D)

Fuck me... God, I really miss that,
having a boner you can hang a towel
on. My johnson used to stand up and
watch me shave, now it watches me
pull up my socks.

Which is right across the street. Sal turns and goes inside.
The others have no choice but to follow.

INT. BLARNEY STONE - NIGHT 49

They sit at the bar. Sal has escalated to a shot and a beer.
Mueller has a ginger ale; Doc, a beer.

MUELLER
How much time do we have?

SAL
Enjoy, old man. It's the Big Apple.
We got the time.

MUELLER
I have to call my wife.

SAL
See? Again, you need a fuckin'
wireless telephone. You could sit
right here and dial her up and you
wouldn't have to get off the stool
and hobble the full length of this
place and have to stand on your
feet next to the shitter just to
say, "I miss you, dear, I hope you
still love me, even though I used
to fuck whores."

Though on his way, Mueller swings his cane around toward
Sal's head, just missing as Sal ducks.

SAL (CONT'D)
I'm still too quick for you,
floatin' like a butterfly.
Mueller continues on as Sal waves to the bartender.

The bartender pours another shot. Doc takes some money out of
his brown envelope.

SAL (CONT'D)
Drink up. Here's to duty and honor.

Sal knocks back the shot.

DOC
I guess it woulda been an honor,
the whole Arlington thing.

SAL
Sometimes the real honor is turning
down the honor.

DOC
Wouldn't you be honored?

SAL
Don't matter to me. Drop me
anywhere. You know what I put down
when I have to write who to notify
in case of emergency?

DOC

Your lady friend?
SAL

County coroner.

50 LATER - Mueller has rejoined the group. 50

SAL (CONT'D)

Request permission to have another,

sir?
MUELLER

Ain't nobody gonna tell you you
can't have a drink. Someday you're
gonna have to tell yourself.

Sal signals the bartender to pour another.
SAL
Barkeep, I'm gonna have just one
more drink... and then I'm gonna
have another.

MUELLER
You have a drinking problem.

(CONTINUED)
75.

SAL
No problem, really. I think I got
it down.
(offers toast)
Born in pain, live in fear, die
alone.

He chugs it.

MUELLER
Could you be any more Irish right
now?

SAL

Nope, though my mom was half
Italian. I got the best of both -
I'm an Irish drinker and an Italian
lover.

Doc has been watching the TV above the bar. It's the same
footage of Saddam getting his physical exam, along with other
shots, like the picture of his two sons displayed after they
were killed.

DOC
I lost one, he lost two.

SAL
I guess he thought it was worth it.

DOC
It wasn't worth it. Not to me.

Now George Bush Jr. is on the TV, giving an interview.
DOC (CONT'D)
Would it be worth his twin
daughters? He's got twins, right?

SAL
Who? The cheerleader?

Sal gets up and goes over to the bartender.

DOC
Who?

MUELLER
He was a cheerleader in college.

DOC

Would it be worth their lives?
Even one of â€˜em?

(CONTINUED)
76.

MUELLER
Good luck gettin' that answered.

51 EXT. BLARNEY STONE - NIGHT 51

The three of them come out, Sal and Doc none too steady. They
go in one direction, stop to get their bearings, then go in
another direction. Sal spots a phone shop across the street
and attempts to cross in the middle. Mueller hooks him with
his cane and pulls him back.

52 INT. PHONE SHOP - NIGHT 52
An overwhelming display of hi-tech. A CLERK is helping them.

SAL
How many minutes do I get again?

CLERK
On this plan, five hundred.

SAL
Every month?

CLERK
Will that be enough?

SAL
Enough? How can anybody talk for
more than five hundred minutes a
month on a fuckin' telephone?

MUELLER
We're gonna miss our train, sure as
God made little green apples.

With a flourish, Sal slaps his MasterCard on the counter.

SAL
This goes through, you got a sale
young lady, and I go hi-tech.

53 LATER - as Sal signs the papers... 53

CLERK
You can call other people who use
this same plan and it won't count
against your minutes.

SAL

Get out. Now, that's a helluva
deal.

(CONTINUED)
77.

MUELLER
What do you care? Who do you know
on this plan?

SAL
You two fuckers! Get you some
phones, right now.

MUELLER
Don't need one, don't want one.

DOC
I wouldn't mind having one, to tell
you the truth. I've often thought
about it.

SAL
Done! Barkeep, a couple phones for
my partners here.

DOC
So he and I can talk anytime, even
though he's in Norfolk and I'm in
New Hampshire and it don't cost us
nothing, right?

CLERK
That's the deal.

DOC
C'mon, Mueller. With three-way
calling and all we can talk to each
other at the same time.

MUELLER
Well, we're doing that right now,
aren't we?

DOC
C'mon, Mueller.

MUELLER
What if I don't like it? Now I've
got a contract for two years?

SAL
What if you fall down? A real
possibility with your gimpy knee.
And you're in a ditch, and you
can't get up, and nobody can see
you, and it starts to rain, and the
ditch fills up with water? Looks
like you're gonna drown. Farewell,
old Reverend Mueller.

SAL (CONT'D)
Ah, but with your wireless phone
you can call for help.

CLERK
And 9-1-1 calls do not count
against your minutes.

Mueller looks like he is weakening.

SAL
Sold!

EXT. 35TH STREET - NIGHT 54

Sal hurries on ahead of the other two, dialing a number on
his new phone. He ducks into an enclave off the street and is
momentarily out of sight. Mueller's phone rings and he
fumbles to answer.

MUELLER
Hello?

SAL
(disguised voice)
Is this Reverend Mueller?

MUELLER
What?

SAL
This is God. It don't count
against your minutes to talk with
me.

They've now caught up with Sal, who emerges with a big smile
on his face.

MUELLER
Don't be burning my minutes with
foolishness.
He hangs up.

DOC
Call Redman back on the train.

They once again fall into pace together as Sal dials.

SAL

Hey, Redman, guess who this is!
Right!

chest)

He knew it was me. Listen up, John,

What's my phone number?

It's in the display.

SAL
What display? There's no number

DOC

It comes on when you turn on the

phone.

Sal turns it off and on. He takes a pen out of his pocket and

writes the number on his palm.

SAL
John? Shit, I lost him.
DOC
Well, you hung up on him.
SAL
Shit.
MUELLER
You don't even know how to use
thing.
He dials again.
SAL
John Redman, sorry about that.

What? Oh.

What's he saying?

SAL
They're on their way to Boston.

says they'll wait for us.

INT. PENN STATION - NIGHT 55

The three of them seem to be wandering in different
directions, getting information. Finally they come together.

SAL
Good news. We can catch the
express, right to Boston.

MUELLER
When?

SAL
Seven a.m.

DOC

Oh, jeez...
Mueller gives Sal a withering look.
INT. BAR - NIGHT 56

They're having dinner at the bar. Sal has his phone on the
bar. Mueller has put Doc between them. The bartender switches
the TV to a basketball game.

SAL
Oh look, a show on black history.
Is it that month already?

MUELLER
Very funny.

Back on the game, a player steals the ball, breaks away and
goes airborne. He stuffs it.

SAL
Let me point out something to you.
The butt-ugliest shot in basketball
is the slam dunk. What does it
mean, anyway? What does it say
about the dude who stuffs it?

DOC
That he's pretty darn tall.

(CONTINUED)
81.

SAL
Dudes were tall before. They didn't
go around hammerin' the ball
through the hoop every time down
the court. Ugly fuckin' shot and
now they're stuck with it. Hangin'
on the hoop, all that shit. Now,
you take the fade-away jump shot;
aman is covered, fenced away from
the basket, he goes up, drops back,
arcs that puppy over the defense.
Beautiful. Elegant. Earl-the-Pearl

skillful.

DOC
Free throws are what win or lose
the game.

SAL

Well, but they interrupt the
fucking action. They're boring and
there are too many of them. You're
not supposed to be bangin' into
each other. Fouls should be
shameful, but, fuck, there ain't no
shame anywhere anymore.

MUELLER
Look who's talking. Have you ever
been ashamed about anything? Ever
in your life?

SAL
Only once.

They fall silent, then resume their meal.

SAL (CONT'D)
Boston was where he was from.

He expects someone to say something but no one does.
SAL (CONT'D)
I'm checking to see if he's got any
family still there.

DOC
Why?

MUELLER
Because he's drunk.

SAL
What does that have to do with it?

(CONTINUED)
82.

MUELLER
This happen every time you drink?

SAL
Pretty much.

MUELLER
Then don't drink.

SAL
It's what I got instead of God.

MUELLER
Okay, I get it. I found God, Doc
did his time, and you got drunk.

SAL
And maybe he got the best of the
deal.

MUELLER

He was gonna die anyway, Sal.

SAL
But he didn't have to suffer. Not
that much anyway.

DOC

Jimmy Hightower! We can't even say
his name. We all feel guilty about
how he suffered as he was dying,
but did it ever occur to you that
Maybe nobody would have been shot
at all, and everyone would still be
alive if we'd all been doing our
jobs instead of fuckin' around?

57 EXT. PENN STATION - NIGHT 57
They make their way back to Penn Station.
MUELLER
Now we only got, what, three more
hours to wait.
SAL
On the town - two old jarheads and
a chicken of the sea.

DOC
Only we ain't dancing.

SAL
Fuck, we're hardly hobbling.

(CONTINUED)
83.

Even Mueller has to smile.

Suddenly we hear the odd electronic tones of Raindrops Keep
Falling on My Head. Sal jumps, spins around. The music is
coming from his chest.

SAL (CONT'D)
The fuck...!?

MUELLER
It's your fancy new phone.
SAL
It does that?
DOC
Answer it, Sal. It must be John

Redman.
Sal digs the phone out of his pocket.

SAL
(answering)
Hello?

FEMALE PHONE VOICE (0.S.)
(with Indian accent)
Mr. Nealon...?

SAL
Yeah.

FEMALE PHONE VOICE (0.S.)
My name is Sharon. How are you this
evening, Mr. Nealon?

SAL
Not all that great, frankly.

FEMALE PHONE VOICE (0.S.)
I'm sorry to hear that. I wanted to
let you know that my manager will
be in your area in the next few
days and would love to show you how
to make a twelve to twenty percent
return by investing in
international market funds.

SAL
Wait a minute... I don't even know
my own fuckin' number, how the hell
did you get it?

FEMALE PHONE VOICE (0.S.)
Have I called at an inconvenient
time?

SAL
What do you think, bitch?

He makes like he is going to throw the phone across the
street, then smiles and tucks it away.

INT. PENN STATION - EARLY MORNING 58

As the place comes to life, our three pull their aching bones
off the benches and try to wake up.

INT. TRAIN #2 - MORNING - MOVING 59

On the way to Boston, the three of them are half-asleep. Doc
stares out of the window.

DOC

What were their names?
SAL

Who?
DOC

His sons. Saddam's. The ones they
shot up and put on display like it
was the old Wild West.

SAL
Fuck, Doc, it's too early in the
day.

DOC

I was just thinking.

SAL
I don't know. Weird-ass A-rab
names. Hugo and Queasy, like that.

MUELLER
They were named Uday and Qusay.
Fairly simple names.

SAL
Sure, if you're used to Leteesha
and Kuamme.

MUELLER

You're a racist as well as an
alcoholic.

(CONTINUED)
85.

SAL
You forgot sexist. Fair to
everybody. What did you name your
kids?

MUELLER
Otis and Sally.

SAL
Now that's nice. A kid should
always be able to spell his own
name. Named her after me, didn't
you? Sally.

MUELLER
Say what?

SAL
After old Sal. I ever have a kid
I'll name him after you, Dick.
First he'll be little Dick, then
he'll grow up to be big Dick.

DOC
What if it was a girl?

MUELLER
Look at him, Doc. Even if he had
any left swimming in him, what
woman of childbearing age is gonna
spread her legs for him?

SAL
Your Sally, if you'll make the
introductions.

Sal once again jumps out of range of Mueller's cane.

MUELLER
I swear I'm gonna brain you, I
don't care if there's already a
plate in your head. I'll put
another one â€˜em there.

SAL
Seriously though, padre, can I ask
you a personal question?

MUELLER
No.

SAL
How come you married a black woman?

(CONTINUED)
86.

MUELLER
What?!

SAL
Don't you tell me you never had a
white woman. It was the 70s.

MUELLER
As I recall, white dudes finally
admitted having an eye for black
women .

SAL
Oh, yeah, I'm gaga for the sisters
myself. And they dig me too. Well,

a couple of â€˜em did... fora
time... then I'd say somethin'
stupid.

MUELLER

No, you? Say something stupid to a
black person?

SAL
â€˜Course I had a couple bouts of
yellow fever too... and always did

have a sweet tooth for the Latin
babes. I got nothin' against white
women, mind you. They're okay, some
of â€˜em. But we were talkin' about
you marrying a black woman.

MUELLER
First of all, who I married is none
of your business.

SAL
That's why I'm being so polite
about it.

MUELLER

I'll tell you why. God told me to.

SAL
Whoa. To marry a black girl?

MUELLER
No, to marry Ruth.

SAL
He told you that?

MUELLER
He did.

(CONTINUED)
87.

SAL
Like He told the Reverend Pat
Robertson who was gonna win the
election?

MUELLER
Pat Robertson is a complete phony.

SAL
How come God never talks to me?

MUELLER
Because you can't listen. And he
doesn't talk to Pat Robertson
either.

SAL
But He does talk to you?

MUELLER
I didn't say that. I said He told
me to marry Ruth and be a decent
man and to preach the word.

SAL
So he does speak to you.

MUELLER
He didn't talk to me in words. He
touched my heart.

DOC
Maybe it was Ruth who touched your
heart.

MUELLER

Oh, it was. It was God through
Ruth. I was down and out, and I
didn't care about nothing. A
recovering alcoholic with shot up
legs. Then one day I found Jesus...

SAL
Where was that, bump into him on
the street?

MUELLER
In my heart, the only place you can
find Him. I went down there like
it was a scary cave, which in a way
it was, a dark, unexplored place.
(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
60

88.

MUELLER (CONT'D)

Went down afraid and alone, came
back up fearless and with Jesus at
my side. Next Sunday I took myself
to church...

SAL
Hallelujah! And there was Ruth.

MUELLER
Right there, and everything came
together for me.

DOC

That's a beautiful story.
SAL

Sorry the fuck I asked.

(beat)
If God wants to keep holdin' out on
me, I get it. But would it kill
Him to pat me on the shoulder or
shake my hand like a man? And if
he'd also like to deliver a nice
black girl with a great ass, so
much the better.

EXT. BOSTON STATION - DAY 60

Walking just outside the Boston train station, Sal is in
front of the other two, talking on his cell phone.

DOC
What's he up to?

MUELLER
Look at him wheeling and dealing...
Mr. Cellular Phone.

Sal hears them talking about him and turns toward them, still
on the phone.

SAL
(to Doc and Mueller)
We've got an errand to run.

DOC
We got enough time?

SAL
Sure.

MUELLER

SAL
I'm on with Redman. He and
Washington just got to New
Hampshire. We'll see â€˜em there.
(to Redman)
We'll see you there.

He closes his phone.
INT. DOVER, NH STATION - DAY A60

Redman closes his phone and walks back over to the baggage
car, where Washington and 5 other service members are
starting to carry the box containing the coffin. Redman
salutes as they walk away.

We follow the mortuary affairs detail through the
baggage/storage area of the train station and down an
elevator to the loading dock where a hearse, and the funeral
director LELAND await.

INT. TAXI - DAY - MOVING 61
The taxi is driven by a turbaned driver.

MUELLER
She's been living with it all these
years. What good's it gonna do her?

SAL
We're long overdue, the way I
figure. She ought to know the truth
and we ought to be men enough to
say it.

MUELLER
How'd you find her?

SAL
I got O'Toole to call his
granddaughter and have her look it
up for us on the world wide web.

DOC
What can we possibly say to her?

SAL
The truth. If it'd a been me, I'd
want the other guys to go see my
family.

62

MUELLER
Where is your family?

SAL
They're all dead. I think I have a
cousin left, in Scranton.

The cab pulls up to a small house. They look at the place but
say nothing.

EXT. HIGHTOWER HOUSE - DAY 62

At the door: Mueller knocks with his cane. They wait. He
knocks again.

DOC
Maybe nobody lives here anymore,
maybe.

The door opens, revealing a woman in her 80s. She is wary.

MRS. HIGHTOWER
Yes?

None of them seems able to speak.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 63

Some time later, they're all sitting around in the living
room. Mrs. Hightower directs them through a series of framed
pictures and Christmas card photos that they pass around.

MRS. HIGHTOWER
This was the last picture we ever
got from Jimmy. And this is Jimmy's
little girl all grown up.

DOC
So, how old was she when he died?

MRS. HIGHTOWER
Four months old. Her mom eventually
remarried and they moved to San
Diego. Here's my great-grandkids.

MUELLER
Look at that. He'd be a
grandfather.

MRS. HIGHTOWER
I've never met them in person, but
they call every now and then. So
you three were with my Jimmy?

(CONTINUED)
91.

The old woman stares at him blankly.

SAL
Yes ma'am. We'd already fought us
a long year, and most of us were
still breathing. But that
extension... that four more months
they added on... some of us
couldn't handle it, and, I think we
didn't all...

MRS. HIGHTOWER
What was it all for?

SAL
They said they knew, and we
believed them. But now... we just
came here to tell you what
happened.

MRS. HIGHTOWER
Are you some of the men he saved?

Sal is just frozen. Doc and Mueller look at him wondering
how he's going to respond.

MRS. HIGHTOWER (CONT'D)
Thry told me he saved three or four
of his buddies, before...

SAL
Yes ma'am. We are.
MUELLER
He was a great guy, Jimmy.
DOC
Yeah, we've never forgotten him.
MUELLER
That's why we're here, ma'am. We
owe him.
SAL

We just wanted to come by and pay
our respects.

MUELLER
Let you know he's still in our
hearts.

MRS. HIGHTOWER
That is so sweet of you boys. I
can't thank you enough.

SAL
Take care of yourself.

MRS. HIGHTOWER
This makes my week. Please come
back anytime.

DOC
Thank you, ma'am.

MUELLER
Bless you, Mrs. Hightower.

MRS. HIGHTOWER
You boys be careful out there.

SAL
We will.

INT. TRAIN #3 - LATE AFTERNOON - MOVING 65

They sit in silence, not saying much. Even Sal stares out
the window at the sunset.

EXT. DOVER, NH STATION - NIGHT 66
Washington waits for them, next to a hearse and Leland.
INT. FUNERAL HOME LIMO - NIGHT - MOVING 67
Washington sits next to Leland. In the back seat are Sal, Doc
and Mueller. Outside the window are shells of abandoned

plants and factories, lying idle. Sal just stares out the
window.

SAL
Looks like things used to get made
here.

LELAND
Used to.

SAL

Even morticians better watch out -
they might be outsourcing
undertakin' next.

LELAND
Never happen - American funeral
directors are the best in the
world.

Sal mutters a monologue... not that anyone is much listening
at this point.

SAL

So were the American factories. We
could make anything, quality stuff.
That's how we won two world wars.
Don't be surprised if somebody
figures out that it's cheaper to
ship a body to Mexico and back than
to do it up here. They'll ship it
to China or India once they figure
out it'll save 'em a buck. Don't
matter how good you are.

(new mumbly thought)
Just a matter of time till they
start outsourcing soldiering.
Hell, get a bunch of starving young
people from all over the world, put
â€˜em in a uniform and tell â€˜em to
try to stay alive. When their tour
is over we ship 'em back to where
they came from... no VA hospitals,
or pensions. You lost an arm? You
got PTSD? Tough shit, we're
flushing you down...

EXT. DOC'S HOUSE - NIGHT 68

The limo pulls into the driveway. As the others get out, Sal
quickly goes to the nearest bush in the yard to pee.

MUELLER
If you had any more manners, you'd
be a dog.
Sal continues peeing, emphasizing his relief.

SAL
Now I'm seeing God.

In the small, dark den, embers glow in the fireplace.
Washington lies awake on the sofa.

INT. DOC'S ROOM - NIGHT 70

Mueller lies awake. He can't help but notice the pictures of
Doc and his wife, Larry Jr, etc. Actually, it feels like
Mary still lives there. It seems Doc's barely touched
anything since last January.

INT. LARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 71

Sal is laying on a trundle bed, pulled out from under Larry's
bed, where Doc rests. The room is lit by moonlight. Now an
as-he-left-it shrine to Larry, they're surrounded by the
various photos of family and friends, sports mementoes, music
posters, etc.

SAL
You gonna want to stay on here,
alone?

DOC
I don't know - haven't thought much
about it.

SAL

Portsmouth? The brig right there.
You might want to try another
place. A fresh start.

DOC
But Larry would be here. Mary, too.

SAL
You could always come visit. You
got close friends here?

DOC
Not too many. Not too close.

His voice trails, he's falling asleep. Sal jabs him in the

ribs.

DOC (CONT'D)

What?

SAL
Move to Norfolk. You could work in
my bar.

DOC

I never worked in a bar before.

SAL
Trust me - it ain't that hard.

(CONTINUED)
95.

DOC
Your place don't seem all that
busy.

SAL

That's my fault. I let it go. It
needs new blood. We could get the
grill part going again. I need a
partner.

DOC
A partner?

SAL
Yeah. The bar'd be half yours, and
when I bite it, it'll be all yours.

DOC
Sal... you don't owe me nothing.

SAL
This ain't paying off no debt. I
really do need a partner, and I got
nobody to leave the place to. You
could stay with me for a while, but
then you'd have to find your own
place, 'cause I like to pursue the
ladies and, frankly, you'd cramp my
style.

SAL (CONT'D)
You thinkin' about it?

DOC
I am. I'm picturing it. It's kinda
funny.
SAL
Might be time for another BCD in
your life.
Doc smiles.
DOC

Better career decision...

SAL
Yeah, and if nothin' else, it might
be fun. What's wrong with that?
72

INT. DOC'S HOUSE â€”- MORNING

Sal, Mueller and Washington are in the kitchen having
Sal punches some numbers in his cell phone, waits for
answer.

MUELLER
You purely love that thing, don't
you?

SAL

I can't get that fucker O'Toole to
answer. The place could be burned
down for all I know.

He puts the phone away. Doc comes in with a suit ona

hangar.

DOC
Larry's graduation suit.

WASHINGTON
Looks a little small.

DOC
You think?

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir. Larry bulked up. That's
gonna be way too tight on him.

DOC
I guess I could go down to Penny's
and buy him something new.

WASHINGTON
We still got his dress blues.

MUELLER
Remember how we used to call the
dress blues the tuxedo? By law you
could go to any formal function
wearing that uniform.

SAL
Not that we ever got invited to
one... or would have gone if we
did.

Still, it was good to know you were
always dressed for any occasion.

MUELLER
I do remember that feeling.

WASHINGTON
Yes, sir. I'm glad to know you
never forget it.

MUELLER
Larry must have looked sharp.

DOC
He did. He was proud as a peacock
in that uniform.

WASHINGTON
I know that for a fact.

SAL
Pride is the thing.
(to Mueller)
It's no sin.

MUELLER
No, of course not. Not that kind.

DOC
I could bury him in his dress
uniform, even if.

SAL
Yeah. It means you did something.
You served. Fuck what the
politicians did, you served. You
didn't weasel out of it. You didn't
think it was somebody else's job.
You took it on, man, and you looked
sharp doing it.

I'm gonna. I'm gonna bury him in

Establishing shot.
INT. FUNERAL HOME - MORNING 74

Doc is in the background, talking to Leland about various
details. Washington, forever on duty, stands next to the
coffin. In the foyer, Sal and Mueller sit on opposing
benches, waiting for Doc. Sal is studying Mueller, looking at
him over his folded arms.

MUELLER
Why're you looking at me like that?

SAL
I'm sizin' you up. I'm gonna buy
you a new suit of clothes.

MUELLER
Say what?

SAL
I'm gonna dress you up for the
occasion.

MUELLER
Why, may I ask?

SAL
Because I love you.

MUELLER
I don't need a new suit of clothes.
It's you needs some grooming.

SAL
Neither of us is properly dressed.
But we will be, you watch.

MUELLER
The things that come into your
head. And out of your mouth.

SAL
The loving you thing rattled you,
didn't it, old man?

MUELLER
It's very disturbing.

INT. LARRY'S ROOM - DAY 75

In close-ups: The ritual of a Marine putting on his uniform.
Then we see it is Sal... and Mueller... putting on uniforms
complete with the proper insignias.

SAL
Did I deliver or did I deliver?
MUELLER
The dude gave you these for
nothing?
SAL

On loan. Tailor-mades. Once I told
him why, no charge.

Now they each don the hats, positioning them just right.
Looking good. Doc comes inside and is stopped cold. He looks
at them, speechless. A flood of memories engulfs them all.

EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY 76

Mueller's cane leans against an empty folding chair. Doc sits
at the next chair. Friends and classmates of Larry have
gathered behind him. Next to the graveside is the headstone
of Doc's wife. Mueller stands at the head of the grave. Sal
at the foot, in their dress uniforms. On the other side,
Washington stands at attention as the minister backs away.
They salute. Ceremonially, Sal and Mueller fold the flag into
twelve tight triangular folds. Mueller takes Washington's arm
and Sal carries the flag over to Doc. Sal then holds out the
flag to Doc, whose eyes are red, his lower lip is quivering.

SAL
Doc, I don't know how grateful the
nation is... or how much the

President might regret your loss
and all that... but here it is,
your country's flag.

MUELLER
Put it somewhere and let it remind
you of what your son must have felt
in his heart.

Doc nods.

INT. DOC'S HOUSE - DAY 77
The post-funeral meal. A buffet is set up. The crowd of
mostly young people mills about and speaks in soft tones.

Sal, still in uniform, has a young pretty YOUNG WOMAN
cornered.

(CONTINUED)
100.

SAL
Well... technically speaking I'm no
longer on active duty... but if I

was, well, look at me. Could you
resist all this?

GIRL
It'd be hard.

78 INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY 78

Washington pulls down a pair of skivvies drying on a line in
the shower. He folds them and puts them into his AWOL bag.

The corner of an envelope is visible in a zippered pocket of
the bag. He takes it out. Guilt-stricken. He sits on the
toilet, looking at the sealed envelope.
79 EXT. BACK PORCH - DAY 79
Doc and Washington. Doc holds the envelope.
WASHINGTON

Everybody wrote one, sir. I gave
mine to Larry, he gave his to me.

DOC

What does it say?
WASHINGTON

I don't know, sir.
DOC

What did yours say?
WASHINGTON

(beat)
I forget.

They look at each other. Washington finally lowers his head.
80 INT. HOUSE - DAY 80

Mueller approaches Sal and the girl.

MUELLER
You have to come with me.

SAL
I'm in the middle of something,
padre.

GIRL

Bye, Sarge, nice talking to you.

(CONTINUED)

101.

She goes. He watches her longingly as she blends into the
group. He sighs.

SAL
Remember how it used to be?

EXT. BACK PORCH - DAY 81

Doc is sitting on his back porch. Mueller sits across from
him while Sal is still standing.

SAL
You gotta open it, Doc.

MUELLER
He wanted you to have it, so...

Doc looks from one to the other. He opens the envelope,
unfolds the letter.

As Doc reads silently, we soon see a series of images and we
hear his son Larry's voice. On a shelf in the living room we
pan through a series of photos on display: Larry Junior as a
kid, and in his graduation suit. Mary, a smiling Larry and
Larry Junior, a happy family portrait. The folded flag from
the funeral.

LARRY{V.O.)
Dear Dad. If you are reading this,
then you've been notified. I was
always prepared to sacrifice my
life for my country. You have to be
ready to die defending what you
love. I need you to understand that
I am honored to die in this way.
Don't feel bad that my life was so
short. It was a good life. I know
you never wanted me to join the
Marines, but you supported me even
so. I had the greatest father and I
love you. Now I am with mom. We
will both watch over you. Dad, I
want you to bury me in my uniform,
next to Mom. Your loving son,
Larry.

Sal is now sitting next to Mueller. Doc looks up at them,
saying nothing.

FADE OUT.
