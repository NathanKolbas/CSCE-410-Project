FADE IN

TITLES

WATERIOLE - STONEWALL PASS, NEVADA 1
The desert between Las Vegas and Tonopah, nothing but sage

and greasewood. Sound -- in the distance, a motor. It comes
closer then fades, comes closer, fades.

Pan off the waterhole in the direction of the sound. It
approaches again, a figure appears in the distance.

ON THE MOTORCYCLE 2
Only the rider's back, silver-streaked hair. This gaunt figure
circles lazily in the moonlight, motorcycle tires rumbling over
the alkali. The circles get bigger and now biccer, and as he
comes around this time, the moonlight catches his face, aristo-
cratic cheekbones, a stringy beard, a pilot's light windbreaker.
This is Howard, age 62, looks over 70.

ANOTHER ALIGLE - HOWARD . 3

sweeping under the moon, wider and wider and now he speeds
towards the waterhole, giving the Harley full throttle.

ON THE WATERHOLE 4

A knoll running up to the edge of it.

ON HOWARD 5

heading straicht for the knoll, the chopper kicking up sage
and greasewood and alkali behind it. Tremendous speed -- it
hits the knoll.

ON THE MOTORCYCLE 6

lioward flying through the air, his knees clutched around the
machine, his eyes wide with joy, laughter ringinc throuch the
desert.

The motorcycle clears the waterhole on the leap, Howard snug
in the saddle, lands in the mud on the other side, skids,
churns, the tires spitting mud, now he rolls out on the
desert again.

ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

sweeping into a figure eight, testing his motor now, picking
up speed once more, heading straight for the knoll.

ON THE KNOLL

The motorcycle invisible, only the sound blasting through the
night, louder, louder, and now the motorcycie hits the top of
the knoll. A rock, a stone, something, it kicks, it stutters,
it flies short.

ON HOWARD

His face exactly the same as before, exultation at the leap,
but there is no motorcycle under him now, only air.

ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

His momentum carrying him over the water and he lands with a
crunch on the other side, his head hits the mud, a flare of
blood spurts from his ear.

HOWARD'S POINT OF VIEW

His eye catching sight of his motorcycle fluttering down,
landing with a splash, bubbling as it disappears into the

waterhole.

TITLES OUT

ON HOWARD
picking himself up, stumbling across the desert, nothing but

silence around him, his feet kicking over the alkali. He
trips, a bobcat swings past, looks, moves on.

ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

faltering, falling.

Ne picks himself up, his face scratched, his lips crusted
with saliva, blood caked around his ear,

HOWARD'S POINT OF VIEW 14

Way in the distance, the headlights of a car.

ON HOWARD 15

He starts to raise his hand, almost furtively, but then he
draws it back. He does not want to wave,

He looks towards the moon, spins once like a shot~putter.
Now he falls.

The headlights pass on down the Interstate. Darkness.

LONG SHOT - A SINGLE HEADLIGUT 16

coning down the Interstate now. Sound -- a man singing. The
song is horrible, the voice joyous.

MELVIN (v.o.)
(singing)
‘Well, he called his elves together
To soup up his old sleigh
So Rudolph and the other reindeer
Could rest on Christmas Day....'

INT. CAR - ON MELVIN DUMMAR 17

a face with no secrets, a cowlick and sideburns, looking
younger than his thirties. Montgomery Ward pants and a
shirt with cowboy roses.’ .

NELVIN
(singing)
‘He's got a million miles to travel
And he'll do it in one day
Oh that's because old Santa Claus
Got a soured-up Santa sleich.'

The song trails off into a hun as ?elvin pulls off onto the
side of the road.

undoing his fly. As he reaches into his pants, the sound of
a car in the distance, he quickly turns to hide himself, the
car passes.

Now he reaches in again, but another car catches him in its
lights.

MELVIN
Jeesuz.

He climbs back into his car, stomps on the gas, and he zooms

off the highway and on to the alkali, up an old cattle road.

Now he scuds to a stop, steps out onto the emptiness of the
desert.

ANOTHER ANGLE ~ MELVIN 19
pissing, sighing with relief, his sich mingling with the
crackling of his urine as it hits the desert crust.

ON MELVIN'S FACE 20

Pleasure. The same pleasure he feels at eating, sleeping,
defecating, copulating.

Climbs back into his car. Starts up the motor, backs around,
and the headlight catches a body lying in the deserted cattle
road.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 21
blinks. Squints, now he throws the car into low gear, rolls
slowly towards the body, stops a few feet away.

ON MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW 22

The body doesn't move. Limp, dead.

ON MELVIN 23

following the shaft of the headlight, moving towards the body.
Poised a step away.

Now he crouches over it. A grunt. Melvin rolls it over. A
beard, Howard's long hair. He lifts him, the headlight shines
full into Howard's eyes, they open, flicker. Howard grunts
again.

MELVIN
Whut?

Howard doesn't stir, doesn't answer. Melvin cradles Howard's
head, and the ear comes into view, fresh blood trickling over
the clotting. Melvin heaves Howard up, half-stumbling, half-
carrying him towards the car, opens the passenger side and
shovels him in.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 24
slamming the door shut. Now Melvin looks out towards the
desert.

MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW 25

Only blackness and silence.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 26

climbs into the car on the driver's side, looks over at his
passenger. Howard has scrunched himself into a corner, his

eyes are wide open now, and wild with terror. Melvin catches
it.

Melvin smiles, nothing from Howard. Melvin smiles again.

MELVIN
Whut's the matter, ol' buddy?

Howard doesn't answer. He turns his head a little but as he
turns, blood oozes.

MELVIN
Whut are you doin’ out here?

Silence again. Howard doesn't take his eyes off Melvin.
Melvin leans toward him. Howard braces himself against the
door.

MELVIN
(peering into
Howard's face)
That ear don't look too good to me.
You want a doctor?

Howard shakes his head,

MELVIN (Cont'd) -
There's a doctor in Beatty. That
ain't but a few miles. Want to go
to Beatty?

Howard doesn't answer, just holds himself stiff against the
door.

MELVIN
We'll go to Beatty. Okay?

He throws the car into gear, spins around and heads off to-
wards the interstate.

INT. CAR 27

Melvin at the wheel, Howard hiding in the corner of the seat
offering Melvin as narrow a view of his face as possible.
Suddenly a clatter, Melvin’s head whips around, Howard has
been taken with the shakes, terrible heaves, his teeth chat-
tering.

Howard doubles over trying to warm himself, clutching both
shoulders cross-handed. Melvin reaches for the heater,
clicks it on, nothing happens.

MELVIN
This ain't but a '66 -- damn heater
never did work.

Howard shudders again, a terrible whistling through his teeth.
Melvin bangs the heater with his fist.

HOWARD
It's okay.

MELVIN
What do you mean it's okay? Now
you just hold on there.

Melvin pulls over to the side of the road.

ON MELVIN 28

climbing out, opening the trunk. The trunk light shows two
giant plastic bags full of white powder, some horse harness,

a bow and arrow, a fishing rod, stuffed animals and puli-toys,
a ratty blanket and a pillow.

He fishes out the blanket and pillow.

TWO-SHOT - HOWARD AND MELVIN 29

Melvin leans towards Howard, drapes the blanket over him, but
does not drape. It is about the size of a shirt and the pil-
low he places under his head would fit a doll.

Howard regards them.

MELVIN
They belong to my little girl. Can't
go to sleep without’ her bumby.

Melvin laughs.

MELVIN
Shit.

Howard shivers, the tiny blanket falls off him. He doesn't
have the strength to pick it up. Melvin bends over to re-
trieve it, as he does his head hits the dashboard and the
heater whirrs on.

MELVIN
Well, damn! Damn!

INT. CAR 29-A

He laughs again. Nothing fron Howard, still underneath the
baby blanket, but now allowing his head to ease back ever so
slightly into the pillow.

Melvin reaches his hand under the heater.

MELVIN
Warm as toast! You brought me luck,
ol' buddy. That heater ain't worked
since my wife kicked it last time I
undressed her in the car.

Howard stirs slightly, Melvin squints over at him. Melvin
reaches across Howard, flips open the glove compartment --
a torrent of bills and kleenex, a flashlight, half-eaten
candy bars, some knitting needles, a pair of scissors, old
Dixie cups.

Melvin rummages around in the mess.

MELVIN
I was lookin' for a band-aid.

HOWARD
Keep your eye on the road.

Melvin rummages some more, more Papers fall out, Howard half-
tries to pick them up.

MELVIN
Leave 'em. They ain't but a bunch
of collection notices.

He snaps the glove compartment shut, looks over at Howard's
ear.

MELVIN
We ain't gonna get to Beatty any
too soon.

HOWARD
No doctors.

MELVIN

There ain't no doctors there. Just
a public health nurse.

HOWARD
No nurses.

MELVIN
You don't like nurses?

HOWARD
No, I don't.

MELVIN

Okay, okay.
They ride in silence.
Howard is heaving now, Melvin watches him closely.

EXT. GABBS, NEVADA - BEFORE SUNRISE 39

The middle of nowhere. In the distance, dense, white chemical
smoke curling up off the ridge where a magnesium plant hovers. (xX)
Down below, almost a mile away, the town, rutted dirt streets
lined with trailers.

ON THE PLANT 40

The whistle blows. A handful of workers emerges, climb into
their battered cars. Graveyard moving out, day moving in.

ON MELVIN 41

driving down a baked-clay side street, dirty dogs clearing
out of the way. A battered Airstream trailer lies ahead on
the right. Pulling into the yard, grassless and sandy, a
plastic pool caked with mud. A pull toy straddling an old
clothes wringer. A clothesline, a child's snowsuit pinned
to it.

ON MELVIN 42

climbing out of the car, picking his way to the door of the
trailer, past a new Honda leaning against the air drums.

INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER 43

A dinette set fighting for space with a child's bicycle and
toys. A new TV, a dishrag from the evening meal draped over
it.

Melvin moves to a partition, a blanket strung on a piece of
twine.

MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

Darcy, a nymphet 10 years old, sound asleep. He bends to kiss
her, tucks the blanket around her. She smiles. Melvin adjusts
the heater, then moves off, pulling the partition closed.

ON LYNDA . 44

in her middle twenties, hunched sexy shoulders of an ex-cheer-
leader, busky and redolent with sleep now. Melvin peels off
his clothes, they drop at his ankles as he climbs into bed.

ON MELVIN AND LYNDA

He touches her. And she stirs. Melvin is glazed with the
heat of her sleep, the warmth of the bed, Lynda's proximity.
He rustles, she tries to cuiet him, but now he moves over
her. Excited by her, and now she by him, their intimacy
always contained, conscious of Darcy beyond the curtain.

LATER 45

Melvin falling asleep. Lynda awake beside him. The sound of
a car pulling up. Lynda freezes. A car door opens, shuts.

Another car door opens, shuts.

ON LYNDA

She doesn't move, tuned into the sounds, familiar with them
almost, dreading them. Now she gets up and goes to the win-
dow, looks out.

LYNDA'S POINT OF VIEW 46

A jump cable being connected to a battery in Melvin's car.
A spark flies, the car starts. Repossession men in their
Montgomery Ward suits, flip the cable off, throw it in the
trunk of their car. One starts to close the trunk, the other

stops him.
ON MELVIN'S MOTORCYCLE

One lifts the handlebars, the other the rear wheel, ¢ and they
heave it into their trunk.

ON LYNDA 47

Let's go back to when you got the
will, and everybody celebrated and
you were a national hero, Melvin.
And they asked you about your
getting over a hundred million
dollars and I think you sobbed,
choked, went into a sort of deep,
heavy mood. I was kind of caught
by it as I watched it on TV, but
then my wife said, 'My God, it is
just like the women on the game
shows!' I don't watch the game
shows myself, but soon after I
learned you had gotten your wife

so much better -- My God, I was a
child in Minnesota during the
Depression and I can remember, kind
of hoping one of those trucks going
by might have a box of chewing gum
on it and it would fall off. That
