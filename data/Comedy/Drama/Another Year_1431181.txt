ANOTHER YEAR
A film by
Mike Leigh
Title: ‘SPRING’

A big close-up. A middle-aged WOMAN. She is in pain. She
wears no make-up.

Another woman speaks, out of vision. We will discover that
she is a DOCTOR.

DOCTOR
So how long's this been going on
for?

WOMAN

I don't know.

DOCTOR
A few weeks?

WOMAN
A long time.

DOCTOR
A year?

(Pause)

WOMAN
I suppose so.

DOCTOR
A whole year? You've taken your
time to come and see me, haven't
you?

WOMAN
You think it's going to stop,
don't you?

DOCTOR
Right, I'm just going to take
your blood pressure. Can you pop
your arm on the desk for me?
(The close-up ends. From here on in, the shots vary.)
(The WOMAN puts her arm on the desk.)
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
There you go. Can you straighten
it up, and push up your sleeve?
(The WOMAN does so.)

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Are you dozing in the daytime?
WOMAN
Sometimes, so I just need
something to help me sleep.

DOCTOR
I know. How much sleep are you
getting at night?

(She wraps the cloth around the woman's arm.)

WOMAN
I'm not getting any, am I? That's
the problem - that's why I'm
here.

DOCTOR
I understand, sweetheart. Okay...
it's just going to go tight.

(She pumps up the apparatus. The measure rises in the
gauge. Tense, the WOMAN breathes heavily. The DOCTOR
removes the cloth.)

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Have you got any particular
worries at the moment?
(The WOMAN vaguely shakes her head.)

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
No financial problems?

WOMAN
No. I dunno what that's got to do
with it.

DOCTOR

What about at home? How are
things with husband?

(The WOMAN doesn't reply. The DOCTOR gets up, moves round
the WOMAN, and stands behind her with her stethoscope. We
see that the DOCTOR is pregnant, and black.)

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Okay, if you could just lean
forward for me and take a few
deep breaths, in through your
mouth.

(She does so; the DOCTOR listens to her back.)

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
And again.
(More breathing. )

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
‘Ts lovely and clear.

(The DOCTOR returns to her desk.)

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Have you got any kids?

WOMAN
Yes.

DOCTOR
Are they still at home with you?

WOMAN
Son is. Works with his Father.
Daughter's left - only see her
when she wants something.

DOCTOR
And how about you? Have you
started your menopause?

WOMAN
Yes.

DOCTOR
Everything okay?

WOMAN
(Shrugs. Then - ) So will you
give me some sleeping tablets?

DOCTOR
Maybe, but it might not solve
your problem.

WOMAN
Give me a night's sleep, though,
wouldn't it?

DOCTOR
How much alcohol are you
drinking?

WOMAN

I don't drink. My husband drinks.

DOCTOR
Is that a problem?

WOMAN
No.
DOCTOR
Are you taking any drugs?
Medication...?

WOMAN
(Shakes her head)

DOCTOR
How about coffee? Are you
drinking a lot to keep awake?

WOMAN
Coffee - yes.

DOCTOR
Tea?

WOMAN
Yes.

DOCTOR

Well, we might have to look at
that, mightn't we? (Pause.) Okay.
Your blood pressure is slightly
raised, but I'm not overly
concerned about that at the
moment. But I do want you to have
a blood test, just to check your
thyroid. You can make an
appointment at reception.

Alright?
WOMAN
Yes.
DOCTOR
Now... I will give you something

to help you sleep, but just
enough for a week.

WOMAN
What good's that?

DOCTOR
Insomnia isn't a disease.
Sleeping tablets won't make it go
away. We need to find the cause.
Now you're obviously anxious, and
a little depressed; so I want you
to come back, and speak to our
counsellor.

WOMAN
What for?

DOCTOR
I think she'd be able to help
you.
WOMAN
But you'll give me the
prescription now?

DOCTOR
Yes. But will you see the
counsellor? I think it will do
you some good. You think about it
for a moment.

(The WOMAN looks anxious, as the DOCTOR enters data onto
her computer.)

Pouring rain. A middle-aged couple scuttle out of a
reasonably large Edwardian semi-detached suburban house,
loading gardening equipment into the back of a large Volvo
estate car. They drive off.

An allotment. It has stopped raining. The couple are TOM
and GERRI. He has a beard, straggly hair and spectacles.
She has long hair. Both are informal and alternative in
demeanour and attire.

TOM is turning over soil with a spade. He stops, and joins
GERRI, who is planting.

GERRI
Don't do your back in.

TOM
I know. It doesn't get any
easier. Job for a younger man,
this.

GERRI
Joe used to love it here.

TOM
Did you speak to my son and heir?

GERRI
I left him a message on his
answer-phone. (She plants a
plant.)

TOM
It's going to rain again.
More heavy rain. TOM and GERRI are sitting in their nearby
shelter on the allotment, sipping mugs of tea. They share a
joke. They look happy and contented.

Clear, bright weather. A train passes a Land-Rover, which
drives across a barren piece of wasteland by the River
Thames. A motor barge on the water; the cityscape in the
distance. The car circles a drilling rig, and stops.

TOM gets out of the passenger seat, wearing a hard hat, a
suit and tie, and a yellow safety jacket. He and a young
male colleague, who has been driving, walk over to the rig.
Two men are laying out a long metal tube on a bench.

TOM (CONT'D)
Alright, then?

WORKER
Alright, boss.

TOM'S COLLEAGUE
What you got? You hit rock, then?

WORKER
Yeah - we just gone through. This
is the fourth, so I reckon, what?
... Seventeen-and-a-half, give or
take.

TOM'S COLLEAGUE
Seventeen and a half? (To TOM)
It's got to be a scour hollow.

TOM
Probably.

(The other WORKER joins them.)

TOM'S COLLEAGUE
Alright, Mick?

MICK
Alright?

TOM
Hello.

(MICK helps the first WORKER, who unscrews a small section
at one end of the tube.)

TOM (CONT'D)
How long will it take us to get
back?
TOM'S COLLEAGUE
Twenty-five, with traffic. Are
you hungry?

TOM
I am.

TOM'S COLLEAGUE
Good.

FIRST WORKER
There you go.
(He has removed the section. He holds it out to TOM, who
scrapes off a small sample of muddy clay with his fingers.
He inspects it for a second.)

TOM
(cheerfully) Yes! London clay!
Thank you!

TOM'S COLLEAGUE
Thanks, Andy - See you!

ANDY
Cheers!

TOM
Ta ta.

(TOM and his colleague get into the car and drive off, as
ANDY and MICK get on with the job.)

A large industrial shed. Long tables. Technicians
inspecting and logging sample of clay, etc. TOM’S COLLEAGUE
unwraps such a sample. He examines a small piece of clay

with a megnifier. TOM looks on.

TOM'S COLLEAGUE
Dusting of mica.

TOM
Let's have a look.

(TOM'S COLLEAGUE passes him the sample and the magnifier.)

TOM'S COLLEAGUE
‘Ts quite nice.

(TOM inspects it, and laughs. Warm, enthusiastic.)

TOM
Very nice.
(His COLLEAGUE is breaking off another chunk of earth. TOM
points to it.)

TOM (CONT'D)
It's just a dusting, isn't it?

TOM'S COLLEAGUE
Yeah.

The Medical Centre. Another small, unsympathetic room.
GERRI is counselling JANET, the insomniac from the first
scene.

GERRI
What would you say was the
happiest moment of your life?

JANET
What d'you mean?

GERRI
Your nicest memory. Have a think.

(JANET sits in silence. Miserable and expressionless. GERRI
waits for a while.)

GERRI (CONT'D)
When your children were born?
Your wedding day?

JANET
I don't know.

GERRI
Take your time.

JANET
I can't remember.

GERRI
Can't, or won't?

JANET
Mm?

GERRI

Can't or won't remember?

JANET
Don't know what I'm doing here -
I don't want to come. Don't want
to talk about my family - why
should I? None of your business.
(MORE)
JANET (CONT'D)
All I need is a good night's
sleep, and nobody's helping me.

GERRI
Janet, I want to
that's why we're
it's not easy to
personal things.

help you -

here. I know
talk about
Suppose the boot
and

was on the other foot,
someone came to you - say, your
daughter, and said “I haven't
been sleeping for months”. What
would you say to them?

JANET
Go to the doctor.

GERRI
What else would you say?

JANET
I don't know.

GERRI
What would you ask her?

JANET
Is she eating alright, or
something like that.

(GERRI looks at her for a few moments.)

GERRI
Good. Anything else?

JANET
That all she needed was a couple
of months of proper sleep, and
then that would sort it out.

GERRI
Sort what out?

JANET
The sleeping.

GERRI
Okay. (She reflects for a
moment.) On a scale of one to
ten, how happy would you say you
are, Janet?

JANET
One.
10.

GERRI
One. (Slight smile.) I think
there's room for improvement
there, don't you? What is the one
thing that would improve your
life apart from sleep?

JANET
A different life.

GERRI
A different life. Change is
frightening, isn't it?

JANET
Nothing changes.

(Pause. )

A little later. GERRI sees JANET out of the room.

GERRI
I hope to see you next week,
Janet. Same time. I'll be here,
but it's up to you. No pressure.
Bye.

(JANET walks out of the room without saying anything. GERRI
sighs, closes the door, and moves back into the room.)

Later still. Outside GERRI’s room. She comes out with a
CLIENT, who puts on his cap.

GERRI (CONT'D)
Bye, bye, Sam.

SAM
Bye.

(GERRI shuts her door, and crosses the waiting-room. )

GERRI
Look at you! You look like you're
fit to burst.

(She is addressing TANYA, the pregnant doctor we met
earlier. They walk along together, GERRI gently touching
TANYA's tummy.)
11.

TANYA
I am fit to burst. Big Boy's
wrestling his way down.

GERRI
Well, if he pops out, give me a
shout.

TANYA
Sweetheart, I'll do more than
shout!

(GERRI laughs and goes into an office. An attractive,
middle-aged woman with her hair pinned up and wearing a low-
cut dress, is sitting at a computer, surrounded by piles of
files. She is wearing reading glasses.)

WOMAN
Hi, Gerri.

GERRI
Hello, Mary

MARY
You're a sight for sore eyes.

GERRI
Can you process these for me?
(She is carrying some documents.)

MARY
Oh, well, seeing as it's you...

(She takes the documents.)

GERRI
How are you?
MARY
I'm... snowed under, to be

honest. (She takes off her
spectacles.) And I've got a
headache.

GERRI
Have you seen the doctor? (MARY
laughs.) Hello, Gemma!

(A young woman is passing her.)
MARY
I don't suppose you fancy a drink
tonight, do you?

GERRI
I'd love one.
12.

MARY

Oh, great - are you sure?
GERRI

I've only got an hour.
MARY

That's alright.
GERRI

Tom's cooking supper.
MARY

Oh, lovely!
GERRI

I'll see you later.

MARY
Yeah... Yeah.

(GERRI goes. MARY reflects for a moment, then resumes
work. )

In a busy bar. GERRI and MARY are seated at a table,
sharing a bottle of white wine.

MARY (CONT'D)
D’you know, Gerri, I've never
been with a man who could cook.

GERRI
Haven't you?

MARY
No. They could do lots of other
things. (Laughs.)

GERRI
That doesn't get you fed.

MARY
Yeah - keeps a girl happy,
though. (Giggles. )

GERRI
And you can't cook.

MARY
No. Well, I can a bit, but it's
not really my thing.

GERRI
No, it's not!
13.

MARY
Oh - don't remind me about that,
Gerri!

(She giggles again. GERRI smiles.)
GERRI

You could put an ad in the paper:
“Chef wanted.”

MARY
Yeah. “Chef-stroke-boyfriend
required for gorgeous girl” - no:

“mature woman, with cat.”
(Laughs.) No - “matur-ish.” We
don't want to put ‘em off, do we?

(MARY now observes a handsome middle-aged MAN in a suit.
He is standing at the bar, alone, drinking a glass of
wine. )

MARY (CONT'D)

Oh, it's really lovely the way
you and Tom do everything
together.

GERRI
We're very lucky.

MARY
Yeah, you are - but you deserve
it: you're both such lovely
people.

GERRI
Oops - me halo's slipping!

MARY
Yeah, Saint Gerri. (Chuckles. )
No, but I'm really comfortable
with where I am in my life, as
you know. I've got my lovely
little garden flat; I've got a
good job; I've got my health,
touch wood, I've got my
independence. I haven't got
anybody telling me what to do.
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's
not all rosy - I have good days
and bad days like everyone else,
don't I? But, hey!!

GERRI
Are you going to do something
about your garden this year?
14.

MARY
Oh Gerri, no - don't remind me,
I'm really guilty about that.
I've neglected it, haven't I?

GERRI
Yeah, you have.
MARY
Oh, but yesterday... I was just

brushing my teeth, and I looked
out the window, and I saw these
two little daffodils peeping over
the top of the grass. I must get
it cut this year.

GERRI
You have to get yourself that
lawn-mower, Mary.

MARY
Yeah, I know. Couldn't I just get
aman in? It wouldn't cost too

much.

GERRI
Hmm. “Gardener-stroke-chef-stroke-
boyfriend.”

MARY

(Laughing) Yeah. Oh, but no... I
don't want to spend too much

money at the moment, because I'm
going to get myself a little car.

GERRI
Oh, are you?

MARY
Yeah - I've decided, it's about
time.

GERRI

It's a big step.

MARY
Yeah, I know - it's exciting,
isn't it? I mean, I've got a
little bit of money - not a lot,
but... enough. But it does mean
I'm going to have to cut back on
my, you know - shoes, clothes,
jewellery, all my little knick-
knacky things. But that's alright
because I've got loads of
clothes. I mean, my wardrobe
isn't big enough.

(MORE )
15.

MARY (CONT'D)
In fact I'm not doing anything
this weekend, so I'm going to get
up really early,sort out all my
winter clothes, put ‘em into
plastic bags and shove ‘em under
the bed. (She picks up the wine
bottle, and aims for GERRI's
glass.) Can I top you up?

GERRI
No, I'm going now, Mary.

MARY
Oh, aren't you going to help me
finish the bottle?

GERRI
No, really.

MARY
Oh, alright. Well, I think I'm
going to stay for a little while.

(She pours herself the rest of the wine, and glances at the
MAN at the bar.)

MARY (CONT'D)
How's Joe? Have you heard from
him this week?

GERRI
No. But I'm sure he's fine.

MARY
Still not got a girlfriend?

GERRI
I've no idea.

MARY
He must have something on the go,
a good-looking boy like him.

(GERRI has put on her cape. She gets up, and kisses MARY.)

GERRI
See you on Thursday.
MARY
Oh...
GERRI
And you're coming for supper on
Saturday.
MARY

Oh, lovely. Thank you, Gerri.
Give my love to that lovely Tom.
16.

GERRI
I will. You take care.

MARY
Yeah.

(GERRI goes. MARY prepares to flirt with the MAN at the
bar, who for a moment glances in her direction. But almost
immediately, MARY's seductive expression melts to horror,
as an attractive YOUNG WOMAN with long, blonde hair and a
broad smile arrives, and embraces the man. They kiss on the
lips, and MARY looks crestfallen. )

GERRI is enjoying her ample, beautiful back garden. She
tends to a bush, takes a relaxing breath, and goes into her
conservatory, where she sprays a plant or two. Then she
picks a leaf, which she sniffs as she enters her expansive,
attractive kitchen. She crosses to the stove, where TOM is
stirring, He is wearing an apron. She puts her arms round
him from behind, and snuggles up.

GERRI
What's for supper?

TOM
Arrabiata. Are you hungry?

GERRI
I'm starving.

(TOM stops stirring, and turns to face her.)

TOM
Hello.

(He kisses her on the lips.)

TOM (CONT'D)
Have a taste.

(He holds out the wooden spoon.)

GERRI
I hope it's not too hot.

TOM
You can never tell with chillies.

(They taste the sauce in turn, GERRI first.)

GERRI
No...
(GERRI is

TOM

No?
GERRI

Oh! - it's comin’ out me ears!
TOM

Good. Glass of wine?
getting some plates.)
GERRI
No, I've had a couple. Oh, go on -
just a smidgeon.

TOM
That's the spirit.

some red wine. GERRI sets the plates on the

A few minutes later. They are sitting at the table, eating.

GERRI
How was your day?

TOM
Good. I was out and about;
getting my hands dirty. How about

(He does so.)

you?

GERRI
Disappointing. Pass me the
parsley.

TOM
No breakthroughs?

GERRI
I had my alcoholic teacher in
again.

TOM
Yeah.

GERRI

He was pissed as a fart.

TOM
(Amused) Really?
18.

GERRI
(Smiling) It was very upsetting,
actually.

TOM

How did you handle it?

GERRI
I bought him a double scotch.
No, I had to challenge him. I
told him it was up to him.

TOM
How did he take that?

GERRI
Well, I don't know. We'll have to
see.

TOM
Well, at least he came.

GERRI
Hmm. Have we heard from Joe?

TOM
No. But I haven't checked my
emails.

GERRI
I'll ring him later. I'd love to
see him.

TOM

He's alright.

(GERRI reflects, maternally.)

An airy room on a busy main street. Traffic noise outside.
Twenty or so chairs, arranged in a square. A few people are
waiting, This is a community law centre.

JOE enters, a young man of around thirty. He is carrying a
wrapped sandwich and a can of Coke. He addresses an elderly
MAN, who is with a young WOMAN.

JOE
Mr Gupta?

(MR GUPTA and the WOMAN get up. JOE shakes MR GUPTA's
hand. )

JOE (CONT'D)
Joe Hepple. Nice to meet you.
19.

WOMAN
I just came with him.

JOE
Ah - good. Just follow me this
way, please.

(He leads them out of the room.)

JOE (CONT'D)
This way.

An upstairs corridor. They follow him into his tiny,
cluttered office.

JOE (CONT'D)
Excuse the mess. You sit there,
Mr Gupta (He moves a chair.)
And... (to the WOMAN) ... I'll
pop you there.

(He closes the door.)

A little later. JOE is sitting at his desk. He has a letter
in his hand.

JOE (CONT'D)
Okay, now we've opened all these
letters, and I've seen all I need
to see for the time being.
Obviously, it's a sizeable
correspondence, and,
understandably, Mr Gupta hasn't
exactly been in a position to
open them, seeing as he's been in
hospital for the past ten weeks.
But, you're looking fit and
raring to go, Mr Gupta.

(MR GUPTA has not understood any of this, and turns to his
friend.)

MR GUPTA
Tieh?

(The WOMAN shakes her head, meaning to say, not to bother.
JOE picks up another document.)
20.

WOMAN
Excuse me...

JOE
Mm?

WOMAN

Er, how long will this take?

JOE
Oh, not too long.

WOMAN
Er, it’s, just, I have to get
back to work.

JOE
What d’you do?

WOMAN
Er,... restaurant; family
business.

JOE
Oh - tasty.

(She isn't amused.)

JOE (CONT'D)
Okay. Erm, it's important for Mr
Gupta to understand that at this
point he is in no danger of being
evicted.

(Speaking in Hindustani, the WOMAN explains the situation
to a confused MR GUPTA.)

JOE (CONT'D)
Okay? I'm just going to take you
briefly through what’s going to
happen in Court. Erm... I'll be
representing Mr Gupta on the day.
We'll put the case to the judge,
and... (a phone rings) he will
agree to adjourn, which will then
give us time to sort things out,
okay? So, I'll just... excuse me
(He answers the phone.) Hello?

Early on a Saturday evening. MARY puffs on a cigarette,
puts it out on the pavement, a scuttles across a busy main
road.
21.

Inside TOM and GERRI’s front hall. MARY arrives, and
knocks. As GERRI come to the door...

GERRI
I'll get it!

TOM
(elsewhere) Alright!

(GERRI opens the door. MARY is carrying a potted plant.)

GERRI
Hello, Mary!

MARY
Hi, Gerri. It's stopped raining,
thank goodness.

GERRI
I know. Welcome!

MARY
(entering) Oh, thank you. I
bought you a little present -
some thyme.

GERRI
That's lovely!

MARY
It's nothing much.

GERRI
(taking it) Thank you.

MARY
Oh, there he is!

TOM
Hello, love!

(MARY hugs TOM.)

MARY
Hello, Tom. Oh...! Oh, I'm sorry -
I just had to have a cigarette,
and I know you don't like the
smell.

TOM
(Laughing) Don't be daft!

MARY
I'm trying to give up though -
aren't I, Gerri?
22.

GERRI
Oh, are you?

MARY
Only, I've just had a bad
experience on the tube.

TOM
Are you alright?

GERRI
What happened?

MARY
There was this man...

GERRI
What did he do?

MARY
Well, he was lookin’ at me. I
mean, every time I looked up, he
was lookin’ at me...

TOM
Oh, dear.

MARY
Yeah, it was a bit unsettling, to
be honest.

GERRI
Well, you're here now.

MARY
Exactly. And I'm very happy to be
here with both of you.

(She pulls a bottle of wine out of her bag, and gives it to
TOM. )

MARY (CONT'D)
This is for you, Tom.

TOM
Ah!

MARY
It's nothing special.

TOM
(reading the label) Buenos Aires.

MARY
Yeah, because I thought - well,
you went there, didn't you, the
two of you? Argentina.
23.

TOM
No, we didn't - no.

GERRI
No.

MARY
Didn't you?

TOM
No.

GERRI
Tom's been to Brazil. Digging his
holes.

TOM
Yeah.

MARY

Oh, I'm so stupid sometimes!

TOM
That's alright.

GERRI
That's fine.

MARY
Oh, honestly, (She mimes shooting
herself in the head.) Oh, what
are you going to do with me, eh?
I'm just going to run upstairs -
is that alright? I won't be a
minute.

(She hurries upstairs. GERRI repeats MARY's shooting-
herself-in-the-head gesture. Amused, TOM and GERRI go into
the kitchen.)

A bit later, in the kitchen. TOM is chopping vegetables at
the table. GERRI is preparing salad. MARY has a glass of
white wine.

MARY (CONT'D)
I haven't seen you since
Christmas, Tom.

TOM
Really?

(MARY looks at the set table.)
24.

MARY
Oh, it's just the three of us
tonight.
GERRI
Yes.
MARY
Oh, I'm surprised.
GERRI
I did tell you.
MARY
Did you?
GERRI
Mm.
TOM
We wanted you all to ourselves,
Mary.
MARY
Oh...! Thank you, Tom. That's

what all the boys say.
(TOM looks at her.)

MARY (CONT'D)
No, I wasn't sure what to wear. I
didn't know if it was going to be
one of your lovely big dinner
parties, or just us - you know,
casual...

(TOM moves to the sink, next to MARY.)

TOM
I think you’ve got it just about
right, Mary.
GERRI
You look lovely.
MARY
Oh, thank you, Gerri. (She yawns)
Oh... sorry
GERRI
Did you have a late night?
MARY
Oh.... I stayed up, watching the

film. I couldn't wake up this
morning. No, but it was lovely,
having a lie-in on my day off.
25.

GERRI
We stayed in.
MARY
Did you?
GERRI
We listened to some music.
MARY
Oh...?
TOM

Amongst other things.
(A slightly chilly reaction to this from MARY.)

MARY
I thought Joe might be coming.

TOM
I don't think so.

(TOM collects the chopping board from the table.)

GERRI
He's coming tomorrow.

MARY
Oh, that's a shame. I won't see
him. Did Gerri tell you about me
getting a car, Tom?

TOM
Yes.
MARY
What d’you think?
TOM
Exciting. What’re you gonna get?
MARY
Well, I dunno.... er, something
small and.... red.
TOM
Small and red? Well, that narrows
it down.
MARY
Yeah.
GERRI

I hope you're hungry, Mary.
26.

MARY
Oh, I'm starving, Gerri. You know
me.

GERRI

We'll have to fatten you up.

MARY
Oh, it's lovely having your
dinner cooked for you. You don't
really bother when you're by
yourself, do you? I don't,

anyway.

TOM
You're looking well.

MARY
Oh, thank you, Tom!

GERRI
You're nice and slim.

MARY
Am I? Well, I've always been
slim, haven't I?

GERRI
Unlike me. Middle-aged spread.
(She pinches her “spare tyre"”.)

TOM
Shut up! You're perfect -
gorgeous in every way. (He kisses
her on the cheek.) And you know
it!

(Pause. TOM makes salad dressing. GERRI smiles at MARY, who
is looking a little bleak. She manages a half-smile, and
finishes her wine.)

GERRI
Sit yourself down, Mary. Help
yourself to another drink.
(MARY sits at the table. GERRI squeezes TOM's arm.)

GERRI (CONT'D)
How's that dressing coming along?

TOM
As well as can be expected.

(TOM gets on with it. GERRI stirs a pot on the stove. MARY
pours herself another drink, and continues to look bleak.)
27.

Later, in the living room. Dark outside. GERRI and MARY are
sitting, side by side, on the sofa. TOM is sitting ion a
armchair, facing them. All have glasses of wine on the go,
but only MARY is fairly drunk.

MARY
I hear you're going to the
Emerald Isle again, Tom.

TOM
That's correct. Rent a cottage,
take the car.

GERRI
Put the tent in the back.

TOM
And the sleeping-bags. If the
weather's nice we might do a bit
of camping.

MARY
Oh, no! I wouldn't fancy sleeping
in a tent, thank you very much.

TOM
No, I never had you down as one
of nature's Girl Guides, Mary.

MARY
No, Tom! But I am always
prepared. (Laughs)

GERRI
Yes, but what for?

MARY
For anything, Gerri. You know me!
(Laughs)

GERRI
(Chuckling) Yes, I do!

MARY
I'm not going to get a holiday
this year. But then, I never do,
do I, Gerri? Because I haven't
got anyone to go with. It's
alright for you two - you've got
each other.

GERRI
We're going to the Ring of Kerry.
28.

MARY
The what?

TOM
The Ring of Kerry. It's an area.

GERRI
Tralee, Dingle Bay...

MARY
Oh, lovely - you've been there
before, haven't you?

GERRI
That was Donegal.

MARY
Oh.

TOM

The geologist stands on the beach
with his back to the sea, and
looks at the cliffs.

GERRI
Whilst the geologist's wife
stands on the beach with her back
to the cliffs, looking at the
sea.

(MARY ponders this hazily, then - )

MARY
You see, I can't afford to buy my
car and have a holiday. But, if I
had more money, then I could do
both.

TOM
But when you've got your car,
Mary, you'll be able to go
wherever you want, very
reasonably.

MARY
Exactly, Tom. That's exactly why
I'm getting it. You see, I like
just taking off and escaping,
don't I, Gerri?

GERRI
Mm.

MARY
I feel like I'm being somebody
else.
29.

TOM
Really? Who's that, then?

GERRI
Tom!

(TOM grins. GERRI can't conceal a smile.)

MARY
I like to get on the train... But
you see, the car is cheaper than
the train, isn't it?

GERRI
Not environmentally.
MARY
Oh, what? You mean... (she stamps

her feet.) Those are my carbon
footprints, Gerri. (Giggles. )

GERRI
Yes, I know.

(MARY laughs uproariously.)

TOM
Financially, cars are cheaper.
That's why there's no incentive
to go by train.

GERRI
What about the airlines?

TOM
No government wants to increase
the duty on aviation fuel.

MARY
(vaguely) No.

TOM
And this government won't invest
in the railways, so anything we
do is a piss in the ocean.

MARY
Absolutely.

GERRI
And then there's the big
corporations, who keep their
lights on all night in empty
office blocks.
30.

TOM
And we're all expected to do our
bit with eco-bulbs.

MARY
I know. Should I stop recycling
then, Gerri?

GERRI
No.
TOM
You've got to set an example.
MARY
Yeah.
GERRI

Plant a few tomatoes.

TOM
Or courgettes.

(GERRI laughs quietly.)

MARY
I am very environmentally
friendly, actually.

TOM
Are you?

MARY
Yeah. I don't fly. I don't live
in a house that's more than I
need. I don't cook.

TOM
Other people cook for you,
though.

MARY
Who?!

TOM

You get take-aways, don't you?

MARY
That doesn't count. Everybody
gets take-aways. You've built
whole motorways, Tom. How
environmentally friendly is that?

TOM
Exactly!
31.

MARY
Yes! Cars, more cars, more
cars... At least, I'm buying an
old car.

GERRI
Recycled.

MARY
Yeah!

TOM

Yet we're constantly told that
the measure of a thriving economy
is the sale of new cars.

MARY
Yes, but, Tom... If I buy a new
car, that's another car.

TOM

You're absolutely right, Mary.
And would you like some coffee?

(MARY blinks vaguely. Then - )

MARY
No, thank you.

GERRI
I'd like my usual.

In the kitchen, TOM stirs the coffee in the cafetiere, and
waits for it to brew.

Meanwhile, in the living-room, MARY strokes GERRI’s arm.

MARY
Are you alright, Gerri?

GERRI
Yes, Mary, I'm fine. How are you?

(MARY reflects, exuding drink and sadness. Then - )

MARY
I'm happy!

GERRI
Good.
32.

MARY
I just wanted to say, that if you
ever need to share anything, I'm
here for you. I'm a very good
listener.

GERRI
Thank you, Mary. But I'm fine.

MARY
Yeah, I know.

(Pause. Then MARY throws her arms tightly around GERRI,
who is a little taken aback, though she doesn't show it to
MARY. )

GERRI
It's very kind of you, Mary.

(Staying in the clinch, MARY turns her head, so that she
and GERRI are now cheek-to-cheek. )

MARY
Oh, Gerri! Everybody needs
someone to talk to, don't they?

GERRI
Yes, Mary, they do.

(MARY breaks the embrace.)

MARY

Oh, well... Onwards and upwards!
GERRI

You'd better stay the night.
MARY

No.... no.
GERRI

Well, I think you should.

MARY
(saluting) Alright, Gerri -
you're the boss.

GERRI
We'll find you a t-shirt again.

MARY
Will you?
33.

Upstairs, on the landing. GERRI comes out of the bathroom,
holding a towel and a new toothbrush.

GERRI
I've found you a toothbrush.

(MARY is sitting on the stairs.)
MARY
I sometimes wonder what he's
doing; if he thinks about me - I
bet he does.

GERRI
How old was he?

MARY
He'll be sixty-four now.

(TOM is at the top of the stairs.)

TOM
Sixty-four? Blimey, he's older
than me!

GERRI

Almost a pensioner.
TOM
He'll be past it now, Mary - give
us your hand.
(MARY takes his hand, and he helps her up.)

MARY
Oh.... no, Tom.... he was lovely.

GERRI
Well, we all grow old.

(MARY leans unsteadily on the bannister rail. She lowers
her voice.)

MARY
Oh, no, but... he was very, very,
sexy Gerri - d'you know what I
mean?

TOM

Too much information!

(This amuses GERRI.)

MARY
I bet he regrets it, deep down. I
hope he does. (She leans in a
doorway.) He was my big love. But

he was married.
(MORE)
34.

MARY (CONT'D)

Well, what can you do, Tom? You
can't walk around with a label
saying, “Don't fall in love with
me, I'm married”, can you?

(She has now staggered to TOM at the bathroom door.)

TOM
Some people wear a ring. (He
displays his.)

MARY
He didn't. But he wasn't a bad
person. He loved me.

TOM
Sounds to me like he was a
duplicitous shit.

GERRI
Tom!

(TOM and GERRI exchange a look.)

MARY
D’you think it was my fault, Tom?

TOM
No, I don't, Mary. Honest.

GERRI
It takes two to tango.

(MARY staggers back to GERRI, and holds her hands. TOM
raises his eyebrows, and closes the bathroom door behind
him.)

MARY
Oh, so you think it was my fault,
Gerri?

GERRI

I didn't say that.

MARY
No, I know you didn't, really.

(Now she leans on the doorway of JOE's bedroom. )

MARY (CONT'D)
I blame my big heart.

GERRI
Well, we all have to make
choices, don't we?
35.

MARY

Why do I always get it wrong,
Gerri? I mean, look what happened
when I got divorced from that
shit! I let him palm me off with
five thousand nothing pounds. And
what am I left with now? Sod all!
I'm living in a poky rented flat
when I should have my own home at
my age. It's not fair!

(She is fraught. She turns around, staggers into the room,
and collapses onto the bed, face down.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Bastard!

(GERRI proceeds to put her to bed.)

A little later. TOM and GERRI are sitting up in bed,
reading books. Pause. GERRI closes her book, and takes off

her spectacles.

GERRI
My goodness!

TOM
Mm?

GERRI

She gets worse.

TOM
I know. Desperate.

(GERRI puts away her book and spectacles and turns off her
bedside light.)

GERRI

I feel a bit guilty.
TOM

What?
GERRI

Well, you know.

TOM
No....

(GERRI lies down next to TOM. He puts his arm around her.)

GERRI
No. You're right.
36.

TOM
I don't think I really enjoyed
History at school.

GERRI
Didn't you?

TOM
Maybe I did.

TOM (CONT'D)
It's just that the older you get
the more relevant it seems. (He
puts his book and spectacles
away.) To state the bleedin’
obvious.

GERRI
We'll be a part of History, soon.

TOM
Exactly.

(GERRI laughs.)

Next morning. Clear, Spring weather. TOM is outside his
house. Just as he opens the tail-gate of his car, JOE
arrives on his bicycle. He is wearing a cyclist’s safety
helmet.

TOM (CONT'D)
Aha!

JOE
Aha!

TOM
(funny voice) What are you doing,
riding on the pavement, young

man?
JOE
(Alighting) I'm breaking the law,
officer.
TOM
Ey, up!
JOE
Hiya!

(They embrace for a moment.)
37.

TOM
How long’d it take you?

JOE
About an hour.

TOM
Are you knackered?

JOE
I'm ready for bed.

TOM
Late night?

JOE
Hangover. D’you want a hand?

TOM
Yes, please.

JOE
I'll stick this away.

TOM
Alright.

(As he carries his bike towards the side door of the house,
GERRI and MARY appear at the front door. At first, MARY
doesn't see JOE.)

MARY
Oh, he's back. That was quick,
Tom. Did you get the manure?

TOM
Compost.

MARY
Here's Joe!

JOE
Hi, Mary.

MARY

Hello, Joe. What a surprise.
(JOE kisses MARY on her cheek.)

JOE
Are you alright?

MARY
I'm great. How are you - oh,
continental! (JOE has kissed her
on the other cheek.) Oh, he's all
sweaty! (She strokes JOE's
cheek. )
38.

JOE
I've been riding all morning.
MARY
Have you? I like your hat.
GERRI
Aha!
JOE
Aha!
(They hug.)
MARY
Ah, that's right.... never forget
to kiss your mum!
JOE
I never do.
MARY
No - you're a good boy, aren't
you?
JOE
Yeah.

(GERRI joins TOM at the car.)
MARY
I remember when you were this
big. You were a naughty boy.

(JOE unlocks the side door.)

JOE

I still am, from time to time.
MARY

Oh, really?
JOE

I like your coat.
MARY
Oh, thank you. I think I'ma bit
over dressed for a Sunday morning
- what d’you think?
(She opens her coat briefly.)

JOE
Is that what you wore in bed?

(He puts his bike inside. MARY joins him.)
39.

MARY
I slept in your bed, actually -
is that alright?

JOE
As long as you cleaned the
sheets!

MARY
No, I didn't actually - is that a
problem?

JOE
We'll have to wait and see, won't
we?

MARY
Oh, right. Oh, sorry, Tom! I'm in
your way.

(TOM is passing her with a bag of compost. MARY follows JOE
into the street, giggling.)

MARY (CONT'D)
All these strong men!

(JOE passes her with another bag of compost.)

Look at his muscles. (She feels
JOE's arm.)

GERRI
That's why we had him!

(MARY giggles. TOM and JOE join the women on the pavement.)

MARY
Alright, well.... I'm off, then.
TOM
You don't want a lift to the
station?
MARY

Oh, no, it's alright.

TOM
Are you sure?

MARY
Yeah, I'll be fine. I could do
with a walk.

GERRI
Yeah.

MARY
Sorry about.... you know....
40.

GERRI
It's okay.

TOM
It was good to see you.

MARY
Oh, thank you, Tom.

GERRI
Are you alright?

MARY
Yeah; you know... Had a bit of a
wild night, Joe. (Pause.) Well,
I'd best be off.

(She glances over her shoulder, away from the others, at
the horror of the lonely, empty day ahead of her.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh - thanks for saving me that
breakfast, Gerri. It was really
delicious!

GERRI
You're very welcome, Mary.

MARY
Yeah. It's lovely to see you,
Joe. I'll see you soon, I hope -
yeah?

JOE
See you soon.

MARY
Yeah, hopefully. (Pause) Well,
have a lovely day together, all

of you.
TOM
Right. Ta-ta, then.
MARY
Yeah.... bye.

(She walks off.)

MARY (CONT'D)
See you on Tuesday, Gerri.

GERRI
Bye, Mary. Take care!
4l.

MARY
(Over her shoulder) Bye. Bye,
Joe!
JOE
Bye.
MARY
Bye!
TOM
Bye!

(TOM and JOE unload more bags. After some distance, MARY
glances round at them for the last time. Then she
disappears.)

GERRI pushes a wheelbarrow through the allotments. Passing
aman hoeing, she joins TOM and JOE at their patch, and
sets down the barrow.

GERRI
There you go.

JOE
Delicious!

GERRI
Present for you.

(JOE empties the wheelbarrow of compost. TOM is working in
a kneeling position.)

JOE
Matt's getting married.
GERRI
Oh, Matthew!
TOM
Oh, is he? Matt with the guitar?
JOE
No, that's Paul.
TOM
Oh - Matt. Yeah.
GERRI
That’s great!
TOM
Have you met the young lady in
question?
JOE

I certainly have.
42.

TOM

Is she worthy of him?
JOE

No, they hate each other.
GERRI

You mean, is he worthy of her?
TOM

Oh! Beg your pardon, Mrs

Pankhurst!

(GERRI laughs)

TOM (CONT'D)
Where's the stag-do this time?
Buenos Aires?

JOE
No, Dublin.

GERRI
Ooh, lovely.

TOM
Another capital city brought to
its knees!

JOE
Well, we'll try and leave it as
we find it.

GERRI
When are you going?

JOE
July - the wedding's August.

GERRI
Lovely. I'll make some tea.

(She goes towards the shed. The men continue to work.)

TOM and GERRI sit side by side in their shed. JOE stands.
GERRI pours mugs of tea from a large Thermos flask.

GERRI (CONT'D)
So, when is it going to be your
turn?
43.

JOE
A week on Wednesday.
GERRI
Oh - you didn't say.
JOE
I didn't want to spoil the
surprise.
TOM
I knew.
GERRI

Oh, no! I haven't bought a hat!
(Pause. They drink.)

GERRI (CONT'D)
Any news? Nobody...?

JOE
No. Still quiet on that front.

(TOM gives GERRI a gently sardonic look.)

GERRI
What...?

(They both smile. But JOE gazes reflectively into the
distance. )

FADE TO BLACK

Title: ‘SUMMER’

A bright, sunny day. In a train. An overweight, slightly
dishevelled , middle-aged man staggers down the carriage,
carrying two cans of lager an a bag of potato crisps. His
attention is caught briefly by a young woman, who passes
him going the other way. Arriving at his window seat, he is
obliged to disturb a grumpy, middle-aged woman.

He is KEN.

KEN
Sorry, love. Excuse me.

(The woman gets up for him, and he sits down. Debris from
previous food and beer is on the table. He opens a beer,
and takes a swig. Then he starts on the crisps.)
44,

TOM and GERRI’s front door, from the inside. KEN’s figure
appears, through the frosted glass. He knocks vigorously.
TOM sprints out of the kitchen, followed by GERRI.
TOM
(half-singing) Who's that a-
knocking at my door?
(He opens the door.)

KEN
It's only me!

TOM
Bugger off!

KEN
Hello, Tom, mate!

(They hug each other.)

KEN (CONT'D)
Hiya, Gerri, love!

GERRI
Hi, Ken! How are you?

KEN
I'm alright!

(He hugs GERRI.)

GERRI

Oh - crushed ribs!!
KEN

Oh, sorry!
TOM

Give us your bag.
(He takes it.)
KEN
I'm bursting for a pee. I'll just
run upstairs - is that alright?
(He goes upstairs, followed by TOM.)
TOM

I'll put it on your bed. You're
in Joe's room.
45.

Moments later, TOM goes downstairs.

More moments later... KEN comes into the kitchen, taking
off his overcoat.

KEN
Ooh, that's better. I needed
that!

TOM

I'll take your coat.

KEN
Thanks, mate.

(TOM hangs the coat up in the hall.)

KEN (CONT'D)
Gerri!!

(He hugs her again.)

GERRI
(laughing) Careful, Ken! Would
you like a beer?

KEN
Oh, I'd love one - ta!

(TOM leaps onto KEN's back, so that KEN is giving hima
piggy-back. They rotate exuberantly for a few moments,
laughing and whooping, Then KEN puts TOM down. GERRI gives
KEN a beer. She and TOM pick up glasses of wine.)

GERRI
Maniacs.

(They all laugh.)

A bit later, at the kitchen table. The three of them are
eating supper and drinking wine. KEN also has a beer on the

go.

KEN has his jacket off, and his shirt open at the collar,
though he still has on his tie, very loosely. He munches
his food urgently, grunting.

KEN
It's great, this.
46.

GERRI
Thank you.
TOM
Better?
KEN
I haven't eaten since breakfast.
GERRI
(unconvinced) Haven't you?
KEN
No. It's great to see you both!
Cheers!
TOM
Cheers!
GERRI
Cheers!

(They clink glasses. TOM and GERRI chuckle together,
gently. KEN gulps down his wine, and returns to his plate.)

GERRI (CONT'D)
So how's your flat, Ken?

KEN
Oh, same old, same old.

GERRI
You employed a cleaner yet?

KEN
If I got a cleaner in there,
she'd turn around and walk
straight out again.

TOM
You never know - it might give
her a purpose in life.

KEN
It's a bit of a mess but it suits
me.

GERRI
Yeah.

KEN

Five minutes walk to work. I
usually get the bus, but... if
I'm late, I have to leg it, if I
miss the bus. I stop at the caff,
pick up breakfast; I have a
croissant if they haven't got any
iced buns. Cup of tea.

(MORE )
47.

KEN (CONT'D)
I have to smuggle it in. This lad
Steve, he's a right fascist.

TOM
That's your boss, isn't it?

KEN
Yeah, my boss. My “supervisor”.

GERRI
Is he still there?

KEN
Oh, yeah. He's only been with us
three - no, two years. Thirty-
five, looks twelve, treats me
like a child. Bloody graduate!

TOM
You're a graduate.

GERRI
We're all graduates, aren't we?

KEN
Oh, yeah. So we are!

GERRI
You forgot. Would you like some
salad, Ken?

KEN

No, no, I'm alright - ta.
GERRI

Sure.
KEN

Mm. I mean, you spend nearly
forty years trying to get people
out of the dole queue and into
jobs. What thanks do you get? I'm
sick of it!

TOM
At your age you could walk away,
couldn't you?

KEN
I dunno...

TOM
You’ve got a good retirement
package; index-linked pension.

KEN
I could’ve walked away two years
ago.
48.

TOM
Why didn't you?
GERRI
Well, it's not that easy, is it?
TOM
Isn't it?
GERRI

What would you do with your time
if you retired, Ken?

KEN
Pub. Eat, drink, be merry. I
don't know.

(He takes a large swig of wine. TOM and GERRI exchange

glances.)

How's Joe?

GERRI
He's fine.
TOM
He's well, yeah.
GERRI
You'll see him on Sunday.
KEN
Oh, great. Has he got a
girlfriend?
GERRI
No, I don't think so.
TOM
Not that we know of
KEN
Who else is coming to the
barbecue?
TOM
Jack and Janey...
GERRI
Tanya, a GP from work.
TOM
Mary.
KEN

Oh, Mary. Is she?

(GERRI looks at TOM.)
(Pause. )

49,

TOM
And then, of course, there's
yourself, sir. The guest of

honour!
GERRI
Hooray!
KEN
(Laughing) Oh, I don't know about
that!
TOM

What else you been up to?

KEN
Oh, nothing much. Oh - oh, no -
hey! Guess where I went, the
other week.

TOM
Where?
KEN
Hull versus Derby.
TOM
(Laughing) Who d’you cheer for?
KEN
Derby, of course!
TOM
Did you?
KEN

I had to keep quiet - I got stuck
with the Hull mob.

TOM
Was there ‘owt worth cheering?

KEN
No, it were crap.

TOM
I don't think my brother ever
missed one home game.

KEN
No. Me and me dad used to stand
with him on the terraces.
50.

GERRI
He always used to leave Carl at
your mum's on a Saturday
afternoon. Do you remember?

KEN
Oh, yeah.

GERRI
You could hear the roar of the
crowd from your front room,
couldn't you?

TOM
Course you could; it's only three
streets away.

KEN
Our house used to shake.

TOM
Ours did. They all did. During
the Clough Glory Years, we were
at the centre of the footballing
universe.

GERRI
You never went!

TOM
I did occasionally. I wasn't
manic, like him. (Indicating
KEN.) I don't think Ronnie can
afford to go now, the price of
season tickets.

KEN
How is Ronnie? I haven't seen him
for years.

TOM

He's seventy now, you know.
KEN

Is he?
GERRI

Carl's forty-one.

KEN
Bloody hell!

TOM
Linda's still working.

GERRI
She's kept him all his life.
She's worn out, poor woman.
51.

KEN
Is Carl still the same?

TOM
As far as we know. Very sad.

GERRI
Linda's heartbroken.

TOM
So's Ronnie.

GERRI
He's cut himself off.

KEN
I used to have a drink with
Ronnie. When my dad was in the
home, I'd go down to Derby. He
was always in the pub.

TOM
Yep! That's one of the advantages
of being free from the tyranny of
regular employment.

KEN
Yeah, he never bought a round.

TOM
Are you accusing my brother of
being a mean bastard?

KEN
Yeah, I am!

TOM
You're right, he is!

KEN
I know!

(They all laugh. KEN takes a swig of beer from the can.)

Later. It’s now dark. The three are sitting in TOM and
GERRI’s garden. KEN takes a swig from yet another can of
beer. He is smoking a cigarette, and he is drunk.

KEN (CONT'D)
I mean, I... you get to a certain
age... I can't go to the places I
used to; they don't like old
fogies.
52.

TOM
You don't have to go there.

KEN
Yeah, but they're my pubs.

TOM
Not any more, they're not.

KEN
Except they're not like pubs now.
They're all poncy bars.

TOM
Exactly. Things change.

KEN
When I started at work we'd all
socialise together. On a Friday
night everybody would go to the
pub for a drink. Go for a curry.
But now....

GERRI
It's hard, isn't it?

KEN
I mean, who would I go on holiday
with? There's nobody, let's face
it! The only time I went on
holiday was with Pam... Spain.
Nightmare.

TOM
Didn't you go away with Andrea?

GERRI
No, she went off with her sister.
You remember.

TOM
Oh, yeah.
KEN
Stood me up, the bitch.
TOM
It leaves a nasty taste, doesn't
it?
KEN

Girls in bikinis covered with
suntan oil. Boys flexing their
muscles on the beach. No, it's
not for me.

TOM
(Laughing) Oh, I don't know!
53.

GERRI
(Laughing) Sounds nice. You could
try a cultural holiday.

(TOM raises his eyebrows)

(They all

KEN
No, I'm not one for culture.

TOM
Pub culture!

KEN
Young people, young people.
Everything's for young people!
These bars, you know, they're
full of young people shouting
about nothing.

TOM
I seem to remember you got banned
from a number of pubs in Hull for
shouting about nothing. When you
were a young person.

KEN
(Laughing) Yeah... right.
“Ken: we like you. You're a good
bloke, you're good on the darts.
But if you talk about politics
again, you're barred.”

laugh.)

KEN (CONT'D)
No, but these kids. They're just
bloody noisy.

GERRI
Isle of Wight festival, 1968. We
were noisy, weren't we?

TOM
We weren't - he was.

GERRI
(To TOM) You were noisy.

TOM
(To GERRI) You were noisy.

GERRI
I know I was noisy. Remember
"Plastic Penny'?

KEN
Plastic Penny...
54.

GERRI
Where are they now?

TOM
You fancied Plastic Penny.

(GERRI laughs)

TOM (CONT'D)
It's the young person's
prerogative to be noisy.

KEN
Yeah, I know, I know. It's all my
own fault. I'm not meeting the
right people. I'm stuck in a rut.

GERRI
It's not your fault, Ken.

TOM
You are stuck in a rut. That's
why you can't face retirement.

KEN
Yeah, I know. (Pause.) I'm
dreading getting on that train
Sunday night. I always do.

GERRI
Why?

KEN
I know what I'll be thinking.
There's nothing for me in Hull
anymore. Except my job. Most of
my friends have gone.

TOM
Hit you hard when Gordon died,
didn't it?

GERRI

And his wife.

TOM
(To GERRI) She gone?

GERRI
(To TOM) Yes!

KEN
Oh, yeah, they're both gone, now.
Funnily enough, I was thinking
about him on the way down. I
looked out the window, somewhere
in Lincolnshire.... I saw this

fucking tree. It re...
(MORE)
55.
KEN (CONT'D)
(He starts to cry) It reminded me
of his funeral.
(He breaks down.)

GERRI
Oh, Ken! Ken, Ken!

(She gets up, puts her arms round him, and cradles him.)

GERRI (CONT'D)

Come on...
KEN
Gerri, I'm sorry.
GERRI
It's alright.
KEN
Sorry...
GERRI

It's alright, don't worry.

KEN
I'm sorry, Tom. I'm sorry.

(TOM looks on, a little helpless and in pain.)

In her bedroom, GERRI looks in the mirror, and combs her
long, grey hair.

TOM and KEN have moved to the end of the back garden. TOM
sways gently on JOE’s old swing, while KEN, who has sobered
up a bit, sits near him, smoking a cigarette.

TOM
How're you doin’?

KEN
I feel like shit.

TOM
You look like shit.

(KEN laughs.)
56.

TOM (CONT'D)
Apart from that, how are you
doing?

KEN

I still feel like shit.

(TOM laughs.)

TOM
I'll race you to the top.
KEN
What?
TOM
Snake Pass - I'll race you.
KEN
(Laughing) Oh, yeah.
TOM
When was the last time you sat on
a bike?
KEN

1896. Penny Farthing.

(TOM laughs.)

TOM
I tell you what. You and me,
we'll walk... from Edale to
Matlock Bath. Take as long as it
takes. Stay in nice pubs along
the way. What d’you reckon?

KEN
I tell you what: I'll stay in the
pubs, you do the walking.

(They both laugh.)

(Silence)

TOM
Bugger that! You're carrying the
bags!

TOM (CONT'D)

How about it? Serious. We'll go
in the Autumn.

TOM (CONT'D)
What're we going to do with you,
then, eh? You can't go on like
this, that's for sure.
57.

(Pause. )

The next morning. A bright, Summer’s day. Blue sky. Static
clouds. An electric pylon on the distant horizon.

GERRI strolls contentedly through the allotments. She
carries a large basket. She arrives at her plot, and stops.
She closes her eyes, enjoying the sun and the gentle breeze
on her face.

Meanwhile, four men pull their caddies across a golf course
- JOE, TOM’s friend JACK (a genial, middle-aged fellow),
TOM and KEN. Tall residential tower blocks in the distance.

JACK
So, is it every man for himself,
or are we having teams?

JOE
Teams.

TOM
If I may make so bold, I would
suggest that the best plays with
the worst, Jack.

JOE
Good idea.

TOM
In other words, you're with Ken.

JACK
Thanks. It's me and you, Ken! Is
there anything on it?

TOM
Bottle of wine.

JACK
You're on.

Now, under an expansive sky, they have parked their caddies
at the first tee. They prepare to play. Jack holds up a
coin.
58.

JACK (CONT'D)
Are you ready?

KEN
Yeah.

TOM
Yeah, go on.

(JACK drops the coin.)

(They all

(TOM gets

JACK
It's you.

laugh.)

TOM
Shall I kick off?

JOE
Yeah, you take the honour.

out his golf club.)

TOM
So, this father and son team.
JOE
The Double Hepple...
TOM
Yes, take on these unknown
mavericks...
JACK

That's us, Ken!

KEN
Good luck, Tom!

TOM
And good luck to you, Mo. (He
shakes KEN's hand.) Can I just
say what a great pleasure it is
to be playing with you once
again?

JOE
Yeah, yeah. Watch and learn, Ken.

JACK
There's wine on it.

TOM
Right. (He places his ball.) Off
we go.
59.

(He prepares to tee off. He has a practice swing. They all
watch him. Suddenly, just as he is about to hit the ball,
KEN does a very loud mock sneeze, putting his handkerchief
to his nose. He roars with laughter and runs off. TOM drops
his club, and runs after him, mock-hitting him as he goes.)

TOM (CONT'D)
I knew it! I knew you were going
to do that! All my life I've had
to put up with this nonsense from
you, and I'm not going to have it
any longer!

(They disappear over the horizon. JACK takes a shot
instead. )

A bit later. KEN is urinating behind a bush.

JOE
Don't scare the wildlife, Ken!
TOM
How many times a night do you go?
KEN
(emerging) I lose count.
JACK
You’ve got to get it sorted out,
Ken.
TOM
Yeah.

(KEN joins the others, who are playing at the base of an
enormous electricity pylon. JACK tees off.)

JACK
Oh! What a beauty!
TOM
Lovely!
JACK
(To KEN) Good shot, partner!
KEN
Oh, yeah - sorry. Good shot,
Jack!
JACK
Thank you.

(TOM puts his arm round KEN.)
60.

TOM
You alright?

KEN
(Out of breath) Yeah.

(JOE prepares his ball.)

Later. Three long shadows on the putting green - JOE’s,
TOM’s and JACK’s. We only see their feet.

JACK
You want it out, Joe?

JOE
Yep.

(JACK takes the flag out of the hole.)

TOM
Good luck, partner.

JOE
It's all down to this.

(He putts the ball. It proceeds directly towards the
hole...)

JOE (CONT'D)
Looks good...

(The ball drops into the hole. They all roar with delight.
We see the shadow of TOM shaking JOE's hand.)

Now a small, old red car drives erratically down TOM and
GERRI’s street. MARY is at the wheel. She parks clumsily,
half on the kerb. She gets out, with her bag and a bottle
of wine. She runs to TOM and GERRI’s front door. She
knocks, but gets no reply. She is agitated. She adjusts her
hair and her knickers. Then she suddenly realises
something, and rushes through the side entrance, and into
the back garden.

MARY
Gerri! Tom!

TOM
Ha! Here she is!
61.

GERRI
Hello, Mary!

(Grouped round a garden table near a barbecue are TOM,
GERRI, KEN, JACK and TANYA. GERRI is holding TANYA's baby.
The table displays the remains of a meal. TOM is wearing
shorts and his apron. MARY joins them excitedly.)

MARY
Sorry I'm so late!

TOM
What happened?

MARY
It's taken me three hours to get
here. I left home at two. I had
to ask a policeman in the end. I
got so lost.

GERRI
You got lost?
MARY
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
GERRI
You've been here loads of times.
MARY
I know.
GERRI

You know the way.

MARY
Yeah, but I came in my car,
Gerri. Oh, God!

TANYA
What's happened?

MARY
Oh, I'm so stupid! Why do I spoil
everything? I wanted it to be a

surprise.

TOM
You bought a car?

MARY
Yeah.

JOE

God help us.
MARY
I got it ever so cheap. I was
really chuffed with myself,
because they wanted seven hundred
but I offered six hundred; but we
settled at six-fifty. But they
were a really nice couple of
guys, though. I think they were
brothers. One of them had a gold
tooth.

TOM
Did he?

MARY
Yeah. But, they wanted cash. So I
had to go to the cash point on
Wednesday and Thursday and
Friday. So, I couldn't collect it
till after work on Friday. But
they rang on Friday morning to
find out what time I was going to
go round with the money, and had
I sorted out the insurance? Well,
that hadn't even crossed my mind!
So, I spent the whole of my lunch
break on Friday sorting that
out... And it was really
expensive because I haven't
driven since 1984. But I didn't
tell you on Thursday, Gerri,
because I knew I was coming here
today, and I wanted to surprise
you all.

TOM
Well, it is a surprise. Shall I
take that from you? (MARY is
still clutching the wine.)

MARY
Yeah - thanks, Tom.

TOM
Thank you.

MARY
(Giggling) Oh, Tom.... sorry.

(She gives him a hug.)
MARY (CONT'D)
Can I have a little glass,
please?

TOM
Are you sure.

62.
63.

MARY
Yeah.

GERRI
You shouldn't drive if you're
drinking, Mary.

MARY
Yeah - I know, Gerri. But, you're
allowed a couple of glasses,
aren't you, Tanya?

TANYA
Small ones.
MARY
Yeah - Yeah, is that alright,
Tom?
TOM
Yeah.

(He goes off into the house. MARY giggles.)

MARY
Hi, Gerri. (She kisses GERRI.)
I'm really sorry.

GERRI
Oh, don't be so daft.
MARY
Hi, Tanya. (She kisses TANYA.)
TANYA
Hello!
MARY

Oh, we really miss you at work,
don't we, Gerri?

TANYA
Sweetheart!

MARY
When you coming back from
maternity leave?

TANYA
Give us a chance!

(MARY laughs uproariously, and goes to JOE. She hugs him

MARY
Hi, Joe!
64.
JOE
Hi.
MARY
(Tighter still) Oh, it's really

lovely to see you.

JOE
You, too.

(MARY disengages herself from JOE.)

MARY
Hi, Ken.

(KEN moves towards her.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Are you alright?

KEN
Yeah...

(But MARY moves away.)

JOE
Come and sit down, Mary.

GERRI
Have a seat, Mary.

(MARY moves round the table.)

MARY

Is anyone sitting here?
TANYA

No.
GERRI

No.

(MARY sits at the table next to JACK.)

MARY
Oh, this is lovely. Hiya, Jack!

JACK
I thought you were going to miss
me out, Mary!

MARY
Oh, sorry.

(She kisses him on the cheek.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Where's Janey?
65.

JACK
Oh, she's a bit under the weather
this afternoon.

MARY
Oh, I’m sorry to hear that; I'm
starving. Oh - the baby!

TANYA
Oh yeah - the baby!

MARY
I'm sorry, Tanya.

TANYA
That's alright.

(MARY leans over the baby.)

MARY
Hello, little Isaac.

TANYA
Say hello. Don't mind the funny
lady!

MARY

(Giggling) I'm sorry. I didn't
recognise him. Oh, he's asleep.
Oh, hasn't he grown? He's got
ever so big.

TANYA
They do that.

(TOM has returned. He gives MARY a glass of white wine.)

TOM
Here you are.

MARY
Oh, thanks, Tom.

(MARY takes a long swig of wine. GERRI gets up and gives
ISAAC to TANYA. MARY returns to the table.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh, that's better.

GERRI
We've saved you some food, Mary.
I hope it's still warm.

(She takes a cloth off a bowl of food.)
MARY

Oh, thanks, Gerri. Oh, yeah,
that’1l be fine.
66.

(She helps herself to some meat.)

TOM
I'll do you some fresh, if you
like.

MARY
Oh, no, Tom. Don't worry about
me.

(TOM sits down. Everybody is now seated, except KEN, who is
still hovering.)

JOE
So you didn't get arrested then,
Mary?

MARY

No I didn't, Joe. He was very
kind to me, actually.

JACK
What cc is your car?

MARY
What d’you mean?

JACK
How big's the engine?

MARY
Oh I don't know... It's about
this big, I think.

(She demonstrates the size of her engine with her hands.
Loud amusement from all. She looks perplexed. She giggles.)

MARY (CONT'D)
What's so funny?

GERRI
Don't be cruel!

TOM
He means, how powerful is it,
Mary. How many cubic centimetres
is it?

JOE
You should know that.

JACK
On the back, there's numbers,
like one-point-six, or one-point-
nine.
67.

MARY TO ALL:
Oh yeah. I know, yeah. Well,
that's boys' stuff, isn't it?

TANYA
It's not important.

MARY
No, Tanya. I think I'm going to
have a cigarette before I eat
this.

JACK
(getting up) Excuse me - I'll get
out of your way.

GERRI
(getting up) Shall we take Isaac
over there?

TANYA
(getting up) Okay.

MARY
Oh, I thought you wouldn't mind,
cos we're outside.

GERRI
No, we don't, Mary. You carry on.

(TOM and JOE get up.)

TOM

You're alright - you're alright.
MARY

Yeah.
TANYA

It's okay - I fancy a swing.

(MARY giggles, and gets out a cigarette. KEN joins her. His
t-shirt reads “Less thinking - more drinking.")

KEN
Have one of these, Mary.

(He offers a cigarette.)
MARY
Oh, no, it's alright. I've got my
own, thank you.

(She starts to light her cigarette, but KEN beats her to it
with his lighter.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh. Thanks.
68.

(She isn't enthusiastic.)

KEN
I'll have a smoke with you.

(He sits next to her. She moves away from him a little.)

MARY
Well, I don't really smoke,
normally... just the occasional

one or two.
(They both have a drag. Mary gulps some wine. Pause.)

KEN
How're you doing?

MARY
Yeah, I'm... I’m really well,
thanks, Ken. (Another gulp of
wine. )

KEN
Still on your own, are you?

MARY
Yeah, I am, and I like it like
that - you know?

KEN
You're like me.

(An embarrassed silence. They both take drags on their
cigarettes. KEN sips his beer. Pause.)

Meanwhile, TANYA sits on the garden swing, while TOM stands
beside her, holding ISAAC, who is still asleep. During this
scene the camera slowly tracks across TANYA and TOM, ending
of GERRI and JACK.

TOM
He's good.

TANYA
He's great. He's a hungry bugger.

TOM
Is he?

TANYA
Just like his dad.
69.

TOM

Is he a good dad?
TANYA

Yeah.
TOM

Is he a nappy changer?
TANYA

Ish.
TOM

I expect you're too capable.
TANYA

Oh, I am.
TOM

Like Gerri was.

GERRI
Like Gerri was what?

(ISAAC whimpers a little.)

TOM
(To GERRI) Mind your own
business.
TANYA
We're talking about you, not to
you.
(GERRI laughs)
JACK

Hey, thanks for popping around on
Friday. Janey really appreciated

it.

GERRI
How is she?

JACK
Not good.

GERRI
No.

JACK

She’s exhausted all the time,
just getting up and down the
stairs - knocks her out.

GERRI
I noticed.
70.

JACK
And, you know, she could do with
losing a few pounds, but she's
not getting any exercise, so...

GERRI
How are you doing?

JACK
Oh, I'm alright. We stay
cheerful, you know? We don't let
things get us down.

GERRI
That's the spirit.

(Pause. GERRI sips her wine.)

The kitchen. MARY and KEN are at the fridge. MARY is
pouring herself some wine. KEN tries to do it for her.

MARY
No, it's alright, Ken. I can pour
my own wine, thank you very much.

(KEN lets go of the bottle.)

KEN
Sorry.

MARY
Look at the food in this fridge.
(She closes it.) I haven't got
anything in mine. I'll see you
later, alright?

(MARY rushes off. KEN looks helpless and sad.)

JOE and GERRI are sitting on the garden bench.

JOE
Here she comes.

MARY
Can I come in the middle?

GERRI
Course you can.
71.

(MARY sits.)

MARY
Never come between a mother and
her son. (Laughs) Oh, this is my
second one, Gerri.

JOE
Are you sure?

MARY
Yeah; and then that's it. (She
takes a mouthful.)

GERRI
This could be the making of you,
Mary.

MARY

Yeah. I think so, Gerri. I mean,
just driving here today, I felt
like a whole person...

GERRI
Did you?

MARY
Yeah, a free spirit. I mean, even
though the journey was a complete
nightmare from beginning to end -
it was awful, people were getting
so cross with me. D’you know what
I mean, Joe? It's a lovely little
car. I want you to come out and
see it later. I feel really good
behind the wheel - really
special. You looked so lovely
holding that baby, Gerri.

GERRI
He's delightful.

MARY
I expect you're looking forward
to being a grandmother, aren't

you?

GERRI
Hmm... you should ask my son
about that.

JOE

It's got nothing to do with me.
72.

MARY
(Laughing) He's great, isn't he?
You should come out and have a
drink with us some time, me and
your mum.

JOE
Yeah?

MARY
Yeah, why not? We often go, don't
we, Gerri?

GERRI
Occasionally, yes.

JOE
Yeah, I know you do.

MARY
Yeah, yeah. Or it doesn't even
have to be your mum - it could be
just us.

JOE
Just you and me?

MARY
Yeah, well we've known each other
a while, haven't we? We're old
friends, aren't we?

GERRI
Could you get me a refill, Joe?

JOE
(getting up) Yes, Mummy.

GERRI
Thank you.

(MARY laughs uproariously. As JOE crosses the garden to go
into the house, he stops for a moment to speak to TANYA,
who is changing ISAAC's nappy. As he goes into the
conservatory, KEN waddles out, holding a glass and a wine
bottle.)

MARY
Oh, here comes Ken.

(TOM comes out of the conservatory, overtaking KEN
quickly.)

TOM
Everything alright?
73.

TANYA
Yes.

(TOM picks up a bottle of sauce from the barbecue, and
returns to the house.)

TOM
He’s a good lad.

TANYA
Yes.

(KEN ambles towards TANYA. )

MARY
He could be quite good looking if
he wanted to.

(KEN and TANYA chat. We see all this from a distance, i.e.
from GERRI's and MARY's point of view.)

MARY (CONT'D)
He should lose a couple of stone,
shouldn't he?

GERRI
He was a good looking man when he
was young.

MARY
Was he?

GERRI
Mm. He's got a good heart.

(They watch him. Then GERRI turns to MARY.)

GERRI (CONT'D)
Life's not always kind, is it?

MARY
No, it isn't, Gerri.

(She reflects on this for a few moments. KEN and TANYA
chat.)

MARY (CONT'D)
I don't mind the grey hair; I
think that can look quite
distinguished on a man of his
age, but... (she shudders) ...
you know.

(GERRI looks at MARY for a moment, then looks away. MARY is
unsure as to GERRI's thoughts. She reflects again.)
74.

In front of the house. JACK leaves. TOM stands on his
doorstep, his hands in his pockets. He is still wearing his

apron.

(He goes.

TOM
I'll give you a ring in the week.
JACK
We'll have a proper game next
time.
TOM

Yeah. Ta-ta.

JACK
See yer.

TOM glances up and down the street, then goes

inside, closing the door. A dog barks in the distance.)

JOE crosses the back garden, and joins MARY, who is sitting
on the steps of a wooden cabin at the far end. She still
has her wine glass.

MARY
Hi, Joe.
JOE
Hi.
MARY
Have you come back to me?
JOE
I have.
MARY
They all come back in the end.
JOE
Do they?
MARY

In my nightmares.

JOE
Oh, it's as bad as that, is it?

MARY
Oh, let's not open that can of
worms.
75.

JOE
No, let's leave that closed.

MARY
Not today, anyway.

(She strokes his arm.)
MARY (CONT'D)

Oh, how are you, Joe? Is life
treating you kind?

JOE TO MARY:
Can't complain.

MARY
Really?

JOE
Yes.

MARY
Nothing you want to share with
me?

JOE
No, I don't think so.

MARY
Because you know that you can
come and talk to me... any time
you like.

JOE
Well, I'll come and find you if I
need you.

MARY

Yeah; yeah. I like to feel that
I'm always there for you.

JOE
Thanks, Mary. How are you?

(MARY finishes her wine.)

MARY
(introspective) Yeah, I'm
alright... (suddenly sparkling)

No, I'm great, actually!

JOE
Well, you look well.

MARY
Do I? Oh, thank you. (Laughs) I
suddenly feel really liberated.
76.

JOE
Well, you're a free spirit now,
aren't you?

MARY
I know!

JOE
You're your own woman.

(She laughs)

JOE (CONT'D)
The world's your oyster.

MARY
It's so exciting, isn't it? I
feel like Thelma and Louise.
This little car is going to
change my life.

JOE
Well, let's hope so.

MARY
I do feel a bit guilty, though.
But at the end of the day.... so
what? It's my little present to
me.

JOE

That's fair enough.

MARY
Yeah, because if I don't treat
myself, nobody else is going to,

are they?

JOE
What are you going to call this
car?

MARY

Ooh, I don't know. Why, do you
give names to things?

JOE
I've got names for everything.

MARY
(Giggling) Really? Like what?

JOE
Well, my nose is called Roger...

MARY
Oh, you mean... your body parts?
77.

JOE
Yeah, I'm not going to introduce
you to everyone, though.

MARY
(Laughing) What, not even little
Percy?
JOE
Oh, you've already met my knee,
then?
(MARY laughs)
MARY

Oh, Joe - we must go out and have
a drink one night. We have such a

laugh.
JOE
Yeah, we do.
MARY
You see, the thing about you and
me is... that we've always just

sort of clicked, haven't we?

JOE
Yeah.
(Pause. )
MARY
It's nice when that happens,
isn't it?

(Pause. JOE nods imperceptibly. MARY glances up at the
cabin.)

MARY (CONT'D)
D’you remember when you showed me
your little box?

JOE
Yes.
MARY
You wouldn't tell me what was in
it
JOE
I'm still not gonna tell you.
MARY
I know!
JOE

What?
78.

MARY
(Giggling) I'm not telling you.

(She climbs the steps of the cabin, and opens the upper
barn door.)

MARY (CONT'D)
I still think about that. We had
a barbecue that day, didn't we?
Oh, it still smells the same.
It's messy, isn't it? Your
kids’'1l will enjoy playing in
here, won't they? One day.

(Pause. She closes the door.)

MARY (CONT'D)
So, is there anyone special in
your life at the moment, Joe?

JOE
No.

(MARY comes down the steps.)

MARY
Oh, good. No - what I mean is,
that's alright, you're
comfortable with that, aren't
you?

JOE
Am I?

MARY
Well, the thing is, Joe, you're
young. You still want to be out
there, don't you?

JOE
What, sewing my wild oats?

MARY
Well, yeah. Live life while you
can. Don't think about tomorrow.

JOE
A lot of my friends are getting
married.

MARY
Oh, but... Yeah, you wanna be

careful, Joe, because...
See, I got married in my
twenties, and granted, he was the
wrong man, but I was too young -

I couldn't handle it.
(MORE)
79.

MARY (CONT'D)
But when I was in my thirties, I
met the right man, and I was
mature, I was ready for it.
(Pause.) I mean he left me,
but... what can you do?

JOE
It's never too late, Mary.

MARY

Oh, no, I know it isn't, Joe...
and you know me - I'm very much a
glass-half-full kind of girl. But
it's tricky, because... I meet
these older men who want somebody
younger, and that's great,
because I fit the bill. But...
when they find out that... you
know, I'm not as young as they
thought, they don't want to know.
My looks work against me. How old
do you think I look, Joe?

JOE
Sixty...? Seventy...?

(A brief moment of horror, then she realises.)

MARY
Oh, stop it!

(They laugh. But the laughter fades away. Pause.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh, it's alright - you don't have
to answer that. So, when are we
going to have this drink, then?

JOE
Oh, I don't know - I'll have to
check my diary.

MARY
Yeah, you do that. Give me a
call.

JOE
I will.

MARY
Promise.

JOE
I promise.

(Pause. JOE looks away, In these few moment, we see in
MARY's face a multitude of painful thoughts and emotions.)
80.

KEN is standing in the kitchen, by the hall door. He is
holding a glass of red wine and the bottle. TOM comes in

from the hall.

TOM
Hello, mate. Got to get your
train - we should get cracking.
I'll run you to the station.

GERRI
(entering) You've had too much to
drink, Tom.

TOM
(taking off his apron) No, I
haven't!

GERRI

I think you have.

TOM
I'm alright.

GERRI
We can get him a mini-cab.

KEN
No, I'll be fine on the tube.

MARY
(entering) Oh no, you don't want
to get a mini cab.

TOM
No, it might take twenty minutes
to turn up. We haven't got time.

MARY
I had a really bad experience in
a mini-cab once.

(Enter JOE.)

GERRI
You're going on the tube, aren't
you, Joe?

JOE
Of course.

MARY
Oh, no - don't go on the tube,
Joe. I can give you a lift - you
can be my navigator.
81.

JOE

Ooh, that sounds fun.
MARY

Yeah.
TOM

You can give them both a lift.
You're all going in the same
direction.

GERRI
I'm not sure Mary can manage
that.

MARY
Of course I can, Gerri. (She
looks at KEN) Oh, I don't know...

KEN
I'll be fine on the tube -
honest.

JOE

(putting on his coat) It's a
great idea.

MARY
I don't know how to get to King's
Cross, though.

JOE
I do. We can all go together. (He
goes out to the hall)

TOM
That's great. Is that alright
with you, Mary?

MARY
Yeah, of course it is, Tom. It'll
be good practice for me. I'm
gonna run upstairs, before we go
on the journey. (She goes)

GERRI
I'm not sure about this.

JOE
(returning) It'll be fine.

KEN
I'd better pack me bag.

(He follows JOE out of the room)

GERRI
Tom!
82.

TOM
What?

(GERRI laughs)

In the street. MARY leads them out to the car.

MARY
What d’you think, Tom?

TOM
Well, it's small and red. It's
what you asked for.

JOE
What’ve you done, Mary?!

(MARY rushes excitedly round to the driver's door.)

MARY
It's great, isn't it?

TOM
Nice bit of parking, Mary!

(MARY giggles then - )

MARY
Oh - ! Oh, God - I didn't lock
it! It's a good job it didn't get
pinched, isn't it? (She gets into
the car)

TOM
By the way, Mary, it's a one-
point-four.

MARY
(Giggling) Oh - thanks, Tom!

TOM
Well, you must come again. Now
you don't know the way.

(KEN starts to get into the car, but TOM stops him, and

gives him a hug. Then KEN hugs GERRI. As he gets into the
car, JOE hugs GERRI.)

MARY’s car races through London’s busy traffic.
83.

In the car. JOE is in the front, KEN behind.

MARY
Oh, God, Joe. What am I going to
do without you?

JOE
You'll be fine.

MARY
Can't you stay in the car just
till we get to King's Cross?

KEN
We'll be alright, Mary.

MARY
Ken, what are you talking about?
You don't even know London!!

JOE
It'll be sign-posted.

MARY
Oh, it's so lovely having you
sitting next to me, Joe. Telling
me where to go and what to do.

JOE
It's been a pleasure, Mary.

MARY
Oh, please! I'll take you
anywhere you want. I'll take you
home, if you like!

JOE
Just here’ll do.
MARY
Oh, God, alright - let me pull

in.
(She stops the car.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh... bye then.

(She kisses JOE.)
MARY (CONT'D)

Lovely to see you. Don't forget
to give me a ring, will you?
84.

JOE
No, I won't.

KEN
Bye, Joe.

JOE

Yeah, take care.
(JOE and KEN shake hands.)

KEN
See you soon.

JOE
Look after yourself.

MARY
Oh - Joe, where do I go?

JOE
Straight ahead, left round the
one-way system.

MARY
Yeah, okay. Oh, bye then... Bye.

(JOE gets out.)

KEN
I'll get in the front.

(He proceeds to do so.)
MARY
Oh, no, Ken. We haven't got time
for this!

(He pushes the front seat forwards.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh, for God's sake!

(He gets into the front, and closes the door.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh, no need to slam the door!

The car pulls up outside King’s Cross Station.

MARY (CONT'D)
Better hurry up.
85.

KEN
Yeah, I'll run.

MARY
Yeah. See you soon, then.

KEN
Good bye, Mary.

MARY
Bye.

(He leans towards her.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Bye, Ken.

(She proffers her cheek, and he kisses it. Then he puts his
arm round her.)

KEN
I like you, Mary.

MARY
No, Ken!

KEN
Can I phone you?

MARY
No.

KEN

Just for a chat.

MARY
No, you can't!

KEN
I could come down and see you.

MARY
Can you take your hand off of me
please, Ken?

(He removes it.)

KEN
Sorry.

MARY
Look, I'm gonna have to be honest
with you. I just don't have those
kind of feelings for you, Ken -
I'm really sorry.

KEN
Right.
86.

(He takes his bag from the back seat, accidentally hitting
her with it - which he doesn't notice.)

MARY
Oh.

KEN
Sorry, I got carried away. I
didn't mean to.

MARY
It's alright. But hurry up, your
train’s going in a minute.

KEN
Thanks for the lift.

MARY
Yeah, alright. Bye.

(He gets out, and rushes off.)

MARY (CONT'D)
God Almighty!

(She reverses erratically, confusing an unfortunate young

man who is trying to cross the road behind her. The car
drives off, making unhealthy noises.)

Under the Summer sky, KEN’s train races back to Hull.

FADE TO BLACK

Title: ‘AUTUMN’

The allotment, A crisp, Autumn day. Bright sunshine. TOM is
digging up pumpkins. GERRI is picking tomatoes.

Outside the house. TOM takes a box containing their produce
from the back of the car, and follows as GERRI, carrying
her green wellies, unlocks the front door, and enters.

GERRI
I'll put the kettle on.
87.
TOM
The sooner the better!
(TOM walks past the living-room doorway.)
TOM (CONT'D)
Oh!!

JOE
Ahh!!

(He is lying on the sofa, a book open in his hand. They
laugh. )

TOM
What‘re you doing here, you daft
bugger?!
(He puts the box in the hall. JOE gets up and hugs him.)

JOE
I've come to surprise you.

(TOM goes into the room.)

TOM
You certainly did that.
GERRI
(entering) It's lovely to see
you.
(She hugs JOE.)
TOM
Oh!!
GERRI
Uh?!!

(A young woman is behind the door.)
WOMAN
Hello!! Sorry! He made me hide
behind the door.

(Much amusement all round.)

GERRI
You frightened the life out of
me!

TOM

So who's this, then?

JOE
Mum, Dad - this is Katie.
88.

KATIE
Hello!
JOE
This is Tom, and Gerri.
KATIE
Tom and Gerri! That's brilliant!
TOM
Yeah, well... we've learnt to

live with it over the years.
(He puts an arm around GERRI.)

TOM (CONT'D)
So what's your name again?

KATIE/ JOE
Katie.

TOM
Katie.

JOE
So, have you been at the
allotment?

GERRI
Yes.

TOM

Yeah. Gathering the last of the
season's harvest...

GERRI
We've brought back some lovely
tomatoes - haven't we?

TOM
Yeah.
KATIE
Sounds gorgeous.
TOM
We were just going to have a
sandwich...
GERRI

Are you both hungry?

KATIE
I'm starving.

JOE
She's starving.
89.
GERRI
I'll just go and change.
(She goes out.)
TOM
Just get out of this filthy
clobber.
(He follows GERRI, who calls - )

GERRI
You go on through, Joe!

JOE
Alright.

(JOE and KATIE proceed towards the kitchen. They kiss. Then
he squeezes her bottom.)

In the kitchen. GERRI is putting flowers into a vase.

KATIE
This is a lovely big kitchen,
isn't it?

JOE

(ironic) It's gigantic.

KATIE
(humorous) Shut up!

(She gives JOE a loving squeeze. TOM takes food from the
fridge and puts it on the table.)

GERRI
Thank you for the flowers, Katie.

KATIE
Glad you like them.

GERRI
They're lovely.

KATIE
Oh, they're alright.

GERRI
Sit yourself down.

KATIE
Thank you.

(KATIE and JOE sit at the table.)
90.

TOM
So how did you two meet?

JOE
Our eyes met across a crowded
bar.

KATIE
We'd both been stood up by our
dates.

TOM

Ah, the bonding of the jilted.

JOE
Something like that.

KATIE
Pretty much.

GERRI
When was this?

KATIE
Oh, about three months ago,
wasn't it?

JOE
Yeah.

(TOM continues to set the table.)

GERRI
You never told us.

TOM
Master of discretion. I didn't
know he had it in him.

GERRI
My enigmatic son.

JOE
You know me!

TOM
Must be important.

KATIE
Oh, he's a dark horse.

JOE
I wanted to keep you a secret.

KATIE
Your son's a weirdo!
91.

GERRI
Yes, we know. He's having
treatment.

(TOM and GERRI sit at the table.)

TOM
Help yourself. Tuck in. Whatever
you want.

KATIE

Thank you. (To JOE) My mum and
dad know all about you.

JOE
Do they, now?

TOM
And what do they do, Katie?

KATIE
Oh, my dad's a postman, and my
mum works on a make-up counter.

TOM
Oh, yeah?

GERRI
And what do you work at, Katie?

KATIE
I'm an occupational therapist.

GERRI
Oh, are you? Where do you work?

KATIE
At the Royal Free.

GERRI
Oh, that's a great hospital.

KATIE
It's pretty good.

GERRI
Do you specialise?

KATIE
Yeah. Care of the elderly, and
stroke rehab.

TOM
What's straight rehab?

JOE
(Laughing) Stroke rehab!
92.

GERRI
You are going deaf.

TOM
Oh, stroke rehab - I thought you
said, “straight rehab”.

KATIE
What's straight rehab? What, for
gay men who are on the turn?

TOM
For straight men, who've tried
being gay, but want to be
rehabilitated into being
straight.

(JOE and KATIE laugh.)

KATIE
Joe tells me you're a counsellor,
Gerri.

GERRI

Yes, I am, for my sins.

KATIE
But it's great to come home at
the end of the day and feel like
you've made a contribution, isn't

it?
GERRI
Yes, of course.
TOM
Or not, as the case may be.
KATIE
(To TOM) Oh, I'm sure you
contribute!
TOM

I'm not talking about me. I'm
talking about you lot in the
caring professions. I don't care.

JOE
We know!

GERRI
Hard man.

KATIE

And I know you're a geologist,
Tom. But what exactly do you do?
93.

TOM
Ah, yes. Well, strictly speaking,
I'm actually an engineering
geologist, which means that I -

GERRI
He digs holes.

TOM
I investigate...

JOE
You dig holes!

TOM
Alright, I dig holes!

(Everybody laughs)

KATIE
That's just calling a spade a
spade, isn't it?

GERRI
I always call it a shovel.

TOM
You call it a fork. I call ita
trailer-mounted tripod cable
percussive boring unit.

GERRI
And that's why I love him.

TOM
No, I investigate the ground
beneath our feet, to test the
feasibility of various
engineering and building
projects.

KATIE
Oh, it sounds amazing. What are
you working on at the moment?

TOM
Ah, yes. Well, right now the main
project is an eight-metre
diameter tunnel, which is going
to alleviate the pressure on
London's Victorian sewage system.

KATIE
Blimey! Eight metres! That's big!
94.

TOM
Oh, yeah. And it'll follow the
path of the Thames for twenty
miles, up to eighty metres under

ground.
JOE
And that's just for this
household.
(KATIE laughs)
TOM

So, it's quite a big number. But
I'm not doing it on my own.
There's a few of us. And it won't
be finished till after I'm dead.

KATIE
Oh no! You’d better get a move
on!
(They all laugh.)
TOM

Help yourself. Anything you want.
D’you want some ham?

KATIE
Oh, no thanks. I'm a veggie,
actually.

TOM
Are you?

KATIE

Mm. This cheese is gorgeous,
though. Thank you.

GERRI
Help yourself.
KATIE
Thank you.
JOE
What you got planned later?
TOM
Ah, yes... We're having a
visitation.
JOE

Sounds ominous.

GERRI
Mary's coming for tea.
95.

JOE

Oh, I was right.
KATIE

Who's Mary?
GERRI

She's a friend from work.
KATIE

Oh, right.
TOM

Yes, she's er... Hmm, yes.
JOE

She's something else.

KATIE
I won't ask.

(KATIE laughs.)

A little later. JOE opens the front door to reveal MARY.

JOE
(singing) Ta-da!!

MARY
Oh, Joe! How lovely to see you!

(She comes in and throws her arms round him.)

MARY (CONT'D)
This is a surprise. How are you?

(TOM joins them.)

JOE
I'm good.
MARY
Oh, you look great!
JOE
So do you.
MARY

Oh, thank you!

(She laughs, and hugs him again.)
96.

TOM
Hello, Mary! I'm Tom, I'm his
father, I live here.

MARY
Oh, Tom! My two favourite men.

(She hugs TOM.)

JOE
In you go.

(MARY takes JOE's arm.)

MARY
You never rang me.

JOE
I'm sorry.

MARY
Whatever happened to that drink
we were going to have?

JOE
I've got a surprise for you.

MARY
Oh, Joe - you shouldn't have!

(KATIE comes out of the conservatory, holding a basil plant
in a pot. She is followed by GERRI.)

KATIE
Hello!

JOE
Katie, this is Mary. Mary, this
is Katie.

KATIE
Hello, Mary - it's nice to meet
you.

(She shakes MARY's hand.)

MARY
Oh, hi.

GERRI
This is Joe's girlfriend.

(MARY's ebullience drains away. She is devastated.)

KATIE
(To MARY) I like your jacket. (To
JOE) Look, your mum gave me a pot
of basil. Smell that.
97.

GERRI
She's going to make him some
pesto.

KATIE
Lovely.

TOM

Shall I take your jacket, Mary?

MARY
(subdued) Yeah, thanks, Tom.

(He takes it.)

GERRI
How are you, Mary?

MARY
Yeah, I'm really good, Gerri,
thanks, yeah.

GERRI
How was your journey?
MARY
It was alright.
GERRI
Good.
MARY

Oh, no, it wasn't, actually.

TOM
Didn't get lost again, did you?
MARY
Oh no - the journey was alright.
It's the car...

(JOE and KATIE sit at the table.)

TOM
Is it okay?
GERRI
What happened?
MARY
It wouldn't start.
TOM
Oh, no.
MARY

Yeah, it's a nightmare. I had to
come on the tube.
98.

TOM
Did you?
MARY
Yeah, and it got broken into last
night.
GERRI
Oh did it?
JOE
Oh, sorry to hear that.
KATIE
Oh, no.
MARY

Yeah, I did my big weekly
supermarket shop yesterday,

and... which is great, because I
couldn't do that before I had the
car, and erm... I went nice and

early, so it wouldn't be dark
when I got back... and I brought
three bags in, but I must have
left the fourth one on the front
seat... And I got in, I thought,
that's great, that's done. I can
chill out now and have a nice
little glass of wine, and... I
had a really nice evening,
actually. Em... but then, this
morning, I'm in the bathroom and
I'm sitting on the - because it's
the toilet roll that I've left in
the car. So I rush out, and my
window's been smashed; there's
glass everywhere, and all my
toilet rolls have been stolen.

JOE
It's probably kids.

MARY
Yeah, I think you're right, Joe.

KATIE
Are you insured, Mary?

MARY
Yeah, of course I'm insured.

KATIE
Well that's something, isn't it?
99.

MARY
You can't drive a car without
insurance, can you? It's illegal.

KATIE
I know, but what I'm saying is,
at least you'll be able to claim
for your window, won't you?

MARY
I know. Anyway, I'm.... I'm sick
of it. I just left it. It's just
a car. What does it matter?

GERRI
Go on, sit yourself down, Mary.
Put the kettle on, Tom.

TOM
Yeah, yeah. Good idea.

(He proceeds to do so.)

MARY
It's given me a lot of stress,
Tom.

TOM

That car's been a catalogue of
disaster, hasn't it?

MARY
I know.

TOM
Maybe you should cut your losses,
Mary, and get rid of it.

MARY
Yeah, but I've spent so much on
it, Tom. I can't just sell it
now.

TOM
Well, if you keep it, it's only
going to get worse, isn't it?

GERRI
Well, you know what I think,
Mary.

MARY

Yeah... yeah. I'm fed up with it,
to be honest, Tom. I've had three
punctures.

TOM
Three punctures?
100.

MARY
Yeah. My exhaust’s fallen off, I
had to get a new one, my
carburettor went...

TOM
You can't take it back to the
guys you got it from, can you?

MARY
No, well they said they'd
guarantee the labour for three
months but not the parts.
Bastards.

TOM
Other way round, probably, isn't
it? The parts for three months,
but not the labour.

MARY
No... Oh, yeah, that's right. Oh,
I don't know. Anyway, my
windscreen wiper got ripped off,
I got three points for speeding,
at sixty pounds each, so, I got
nine points on my driving
licence, haven't I, Gerri?

GERRI
Yes.

MARY
It keeps making funny noises. I
got towed away and I wasn't even
parked on a double yellow line;
I got seven parking tickets...
no, nine parking tickets... and
then, I broke down on the
motorway on the way to
Brighton... and I got towed to
Crawley, which is the last place
I wanna go to, cos I grew up
there, and I hate it. So, I had
to get the train home and then
the train back to Crawley the
next day, and the guy kept trying
to touch me up, and it cost me
nearly five hundred pounds and I
never even got my weekend in
Brighton, and that was supposed
to be my summer holiday, wasn't
it, Gerri?

GERRI
Yes.
101.

MARY

It's not fair, is it?
TOM

No.
GERRI

Well, never mind.

JOE
Come and sit down, Mary. Relax.

(She moves to the table.)

MARY
Yeah, thanks, Joe.
KATIE
Yeah, at least you're here now,
eh?
MARY
What did you say your name was?
KATIE
Katie.
GERRI

Well, the good news is, Mary:
I've made a cake in your honour.

MARY
Oh, thanks, Gerri.

TOM
She knew you were coming, so she
baked a cake.

(GERRI puts the cake on the table, and starts to cut it.)

KATIE
Don't forget to give me the
recipe, will you?

GERRI
No, I won't forget, Katie.

TOM
You haven't tasted it yet.

KATIE
Oh, it smells nice, anyway!

MARY
Yeah, I wouldn't mind having the
recipe for that, Gerri. I've
never baked a cake before.
102.

GERRI
Of course, you can.

JOE:
You can have a cake-off.

KATIE
Oh, I don't think so. I tried
making a fruit cake once.
Everything sank to the bottom, it
was horrible.

JOE
You're a good cook.

KATIE
Thank you.

(A loving moment between them.)

TOM
What about these two, then, Mary?

GERRI
Such a surprise.

(Irritated, MARY looks away.)

TOM
This monster hid this young lady
behind the sitting-room door.

GERRI
Made me jump.

KATIE
(Laughing) Yeah, poor Tom. I
thought I was going to give hima
heart attack.

JOE
She passed the test.

TOM
Surprised you passed the test. I
would have got rid of you on the
spot. (Chuckling) Terrible way to
treat someone.

KATIE
Yeah!

GERRI
We had absolutely no idea.

JOE
This is my big secret.
103.

KATIE
Oh, thanks very much!

TOM
It's obviously serious.

KATIE
Still, it's been really good to
meet you both, though. And we had
a lovely lunch.

MARY
You didn't say you were having
lunch, Gerri.

JOE
We have lunch every day.

MARY
Yeah, I know you have lunch
everyday, Joe.

TOM
Bread and cheese.

GERRI
Nothing special.

KATIE
I thought it was special. We had
some tomatoes from Tom and
Gerri's allotment. Have you
tasted them?

MARY
Yeah, loads of times. Gerri's
always giving me stuff from the
allotment. Aren't you, Gerri?

GERRI
I'll give you some to take home,
Mary.

MARY

Oh, great. Oh... yeah. I can take
them on the tube. (Pause.) So
what is it you do then, Jackie?

KATIE
Katie.

MARY
Katie.

KATIE

Don't worry. I'm an occupational
therapist.
104.

MARY
Oh.

GERRI
She looks after stroke victims,
and the elderly.

KATIE
And, I grew up just down the road
from you, in Croydon.

MARY
I only went to college in
Croydon.

KATIE

Oh, right? Which college?

MARY
Croydon College.

TOM
The aptly named!

(GERRI, TOM , KATIE and JOE laugh.)

KATIE
So which course did you do?
Secretarial?

MARY
What makes you think I'ma
secretary?

KATIE
Well, you are, aren't you? Gerri
said...

GERRI
Yes.

MARY

Well... I got my diploma. I look
after the doctors.

KATIE
Oh, brilliant! So have you two
worked together for a long
time...?

GERRI
Ooh, about twenty years, haven't
we, Mary?

MARY
Yeah.
105.

GERRI
Mary's known Joe since he was
ten.

KATIE

No way! I bet you've got some
embarrassing stories.

MARY
I've got some really nice
stories, actually. Joe and I have
shared some really special
moments together, haven't we,
Joe?

JOE
Yes, Mary.

MARY
It'll just have to be our secret,
won't it?

GERRI
She's almost like an auntie to
him.

MARY
I wouldn't say that.

GERRI
Well, we think of you as an
auntie.

TOM

Auntie Mary!

KATIE
I think that's really sweet.

GERRI
Right, who wants some cake?

KATIE
Yes, please.

(GERRI hands a slice of cake on a plate to JOE, who gives
it to KATIE. Then he hands one to MARY.)

JOE
Auntie Mary!

MARY
Thanks, Joe.

JOE
(To GERRI) Thanks, Mum.
106.

MARY
It must be really boring looking
after old people.

KATIE
No, I love it. You get to know
them really well, and, well...
we're all going to be old one
day, aren't we? Touch wood!

TOM
Some of us already are.

(JOE and KATIE laugh.)
MARY
We look after old people, don't

we, Gerri?

GERRI
No, not in the same way.

(TOM looks at GERRI. Long pause.)

KATIE
Amazing cake.

GERRI
Thank you, Katie.

(They all eat cake in silence.)

A little later. It is now dark outside. TOM leads them all
out of the kitchen, into the hall. KATIE is holding the pot
of basil. MARY hovers in the kitchen doorway.

TOM
Right, we'll see you when we see
you.

KATIE

Soon, hopefully.

JOE
And you'll never know when.

TOM
We'll probably find you hiding in
the shed, some afternoon.

KATIE
Lurking in the bathroom!
107.

JOE

Or down the toilet!
KATIE

Oh nice!
GERRI

You must come to supper.
TOM

Yeah.
KATIE

Yes, please! I hear you're both
excellent cooks - no pressure!

(JOE and KATIE put on their coats.)

GERRI
Tom makes a mean curry.

KATIE
Oh, I love curry.

(MARY taps JOE's arm, and kisses him on the cheek.)

TOM
Well, there's been no litigation
to date.

KATIE
I'll take my chances then.

JOE
(Kissing GERRI) I'll speak to you
later.

GERRI
Bye.

TOM

See you, boy!

JOE
Bye-bye. Take care.

(TOM and JOE hug.)

KATIE
Ah, thank you so much.

TOM
Yeah, take care. Bye.

GERRI
Thank you for the flowers.
108.

KATIE
Pleasure. (Kissing GERRI.) Lovely
to meet you.

GERRI
You too.
KATIE
Bye, Mary.
MARY
Yeah.
KATIE
Really nice to meet you.
MARY
Yeah.
KATIE
Hope you get your car sorted out.
GERRI
Bye, Katie.
KATIE
Bye.
TOM
Bye.
KATIE

Bye. See you soon.

TOM
Yeah, safe journey. Bye.

JOE / KATIE
Bye.

GERRI
Bye.

(JOE and KATIE leave. The front door closes.)

TOM
How about that, then?

GERRI
That's a turn up for the books.

TOM
You're not kidding. If you'll
excuse me, I've got a bit of work
to do.

GERRI
Alright.
109.

(TOM goes upstairs.)

MARY
I was going to bring you some
flowers, Gerri. I just couldn't
find anywhere open.

GERRI
Don't be silly.

(She disappears into the kitchen. MARY follows her. GERRI
starts clearing up the tea things.)

MARY
Gerri?

GERRI
What?

MARY

What d’you think of her?

GERRI
She's lovely, isn't she?

MARY
Well, I don't know...

GERRI
Joe likes her.

MARY
Yeah but - you know...

GERRI
They seem to connect.

MARY
Well, he's only young, isn't he?

GERRI
He's thirty years old, Mary.

MARY
No, but what I mean is, he
doesn't want to rush into
anything. He's only known her for
five minutes.

GERRI
I think Joe knows what he's
doing, actually.

MARY
Well... I hope so.

GERRI
Don't forget your tomatoes, Mary.
110.

MARY
No, I won't. (Half to herself) I
should have brought a bottle of
wine.

(GERRI ignores this, and continues to clear up. Pause.)

MARY (CONT'D)
I might head off in a minute.

GERRI
(smiling politely) Alright then,
Mary.

(She walks out of the room. MARY is confused and
perplexed. )

Outside. GERRI sees MARY out.

GERRI (CONT'D)
Thank you for coming, Mary.

MARY
Yeah, thanks, Gerri. I'll see you
on Tuesday, yeah?

GERRI
Yes. Bye, now.

MARY
Okay, bye.

(GERRI closes the door. MARY leaves.)

TOM and GERRI relax together on the living-room sofa. Each
has a glass of red wine. TOM is reading a newspaper.

TOM
Very sad.

GERRI
Really upsetting.

TOM
Yeah. Are you surprised?

GERRI
Of course I am. No, I'm not,
actually.
111.

TOM
No.

GERRI
It's disappointing.

TOM
So, when are you inviting her
round next?
(GERRI laughs and sips her wine.)

TOM (CONT'D)
Did you see this?

(An article in the newspaper.)

GERRI
It's extraordinary.
TOM
I like whats-her-name?
GERRI
Katie?
TOM
Yeah, she's a laugh, isn't she?
GERRI
She's lovely. He is a dark horse,

our son.
(TOM sips his wine.)
TOM
I think you'll find that we men

are.

(GERRI chuckles. TOM reads the paper.)

FADE TO BLACK.

Title: ‘WINTER’

Early morning. Frost on the ground. TOM and GERRI’s car
speeds up the Ml motorway. Much traffic.

Now it drives along a provincial street of gardenless
terraced houses.
112.

It stops. TOM, GERRI and JOE take various items from the
car, and walk to a small, shabby house with lace curtains.
TOM knocks on the door. They wait. They are dressed as for
a funeral, the two men in black ties.

TOM (CONT'D)
It hasn't changed much, has it?

(The door is opened by an elderly man with longish hair,
sideburns and a moustache. He is RONNIE, TOM's brother.)

TOM (CONT'D)
Hello, mate.

(He goes into the house, touching RONNIE on the shoulder.
He is followed by GERRI and JOE.)

GERRI
How are you, Ron?

(She kisses him.)

JOE
Hiya, Ronnie

TOM
D'you recognise Joe?

JOE
I've grown a bit.

(RONNIE closes the door.)

A few minutes later, in RONNIE’s drab living-room. TOM is
standing by the fireplace, JOE is sitting in an armchair,
and RONNIE sits by the table, smoking a cigarette. GERRI
stands by JOE.

GERRI

How are you managing, Ronnie?
RONNIE

I'll be glad when this is over.
GERRI

This is the hardest day.
TOM

Yeah.
GERRI

She was a lovely person.
113.

JOE
She was.

TOM
Very kind.

GERRI
Mm.

(She goes into the small kitchen, and pours some tea.)

TOM
Have you been eating over the
weekend, Ronnie?

RONNIE
I had some beans.

TOM
Need a bit more than that though,
don't you? D’you want something

now?

RONNIE
No.

GERRI
Are you sure?

RONNIE
Yeah.

JOE
We brought a load of sandwiches,
Ron.

TOM

Some beers.

GERRI
So where's Carl?

TOM
I told him when and where.

JOE
Question is, if he'll turn up.

TOM
Well, that's up to him.

RONNIE
He'd bloody better.

(GERRI gives JOE and TOM mugs of tea.)

JOE
Ta.
114.

TOM
Cheers, Gez.

GERRI
The hearse’1ll be here soon.

TOM
Yeah.

(GERRI brings a cup of tea for RONNIE.)

GERRI
There you are, Ronnie.

RONNIE
Can I have one of them beers now?

TOM
Yeah, you're alright - go on.

(GERRI gets RONNIE a can of beer from the kitchen.)

RONNIE
Ta.

(He opens it.)

TOM opens the front door, to reveal the hearse, the FUNERAL
DIRECTOR, and a young lady ASSISTANT.

TOM
Hello.

(The FUNERAL DIRECTOR removes his top hat.)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Hello; Mr Hepple?

TOM
Yes, I'm Tom Hepple. I think we
spoke on the phone.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Hello.

(They shake hands.)
TOM
This is my brother, Ronnie. He's
Linda's husband.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Hello.
115.

(RONNIE joins them.)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Are you all ready?

TOM
Yes, we are, yes. Just the four
of us.

(The FUNERAL DIRECTOR replaces his hat. GERRI and JOE
follow RONNIE into the street. TOM starts to close the
front door.)

TOM (CONT'D)
Have you got the keys, Ronnie?

RONNIE
Yeah.

(TOM closes the door.)

The hearse, followed by the car, drives slowly through the
frost-covered crematorium grounds. It stops outside the
chapel. The FUNERAL DIRECTOR greets the waiting VICAR, and
disappears with him into the building. Assistants open the
tail-gate of the hearse, and attend to the coffin.

The FUNERAL DIRECTOR comes out. He speaks to a young lady
ASSISTANT.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Thank you.

(The ASSISTANT opens the nearside doors of the car for TOM
and JOE, who get out.)

TOM
Thank you.

(GERRI and RONNIE alight on the other side of the car.)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Er, Mr Hepple

TOM
Yes.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
This is Robert, your Minister.

TOM
(To VICAR) Ah! I'm Tom Hepple.
116.

VICAR
Oh, yes.

TOM
This is my brother, Ronnie.
Linda's husband.

(The VICAR shakes hands with RONNIE.)

VICAR
Robert Saunter. I shall be taking
the service.

TOM
We're expecting Ronnie's son,
Carl, to be here, but he doesn't
appear to have turned up yet.

(Pause. They all look vaguely round for CARL.)

VICAR
Right. Well, we'd... er, best be
started.

TOM
Yes.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Are you all ready?

TOM / GERRI
Yes.

(The FUNERAL DIRECTOR speaks to the PALL-BEARERS, who are
waiting by the open hearse.)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Thank you.

(The PALL-BEARERS take the coffin out of the hearse, raise
it onto their shoulders, and wait. From inside the chapel,
recorded music begins (‘Air On a G-String’ from J.S.Bach's
Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D Major). The VICAR begins the

prayer.)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
Thank you.

(The PALL-BEARERS proceed into the Chapel, led by the
VICAR. The family follows. Three MOURNERS, two WOMEN and a

MAN, go in last.)

VICAR
“I am the resurrection and the
life, says the Lord. Those who
believe in me, even though they
die, will live.

(MORE)
117.

VICAR (CONT'D)
Everyone who lives and believes
in me will never die. I am
convinced that neither death, nor
life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor
powers, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor height, nor
depth, nor anything else in all
creation will be able to separate
us from the love of God in Christ
Jesus Our Lord.”

(A crematorium OFFICIAL closes the chapel doors, and walks
away.)

Inside the chapel, a little later. The coffin is on view.
TOM, GERRI, JOE and RONNIE sit on the front row. The three
MOURNERS are at the back, the MAN separate from the TWO
WOMEN. The rows of seats are otherwise empty.

VICAR (CONT'D)
We have entrusted our sister,
Linda Margaret, to God's mercy,
and we now commit her body to be
cremated. “Earth to earth, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust...”

(The automatic curtain closes round the coffin.)

VICAR (CONT'D)
“,..in sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life
through our Lord, Jesus Christ.
Who will transform our frail
bodies that they may be conformed
to his glorious body. Who died,
was buried and rose again for us.
To Him be glory forever. Amen.

(He faces the congregation.)

VICAR (CONT'D)
“May God give you His comfort and
His peace, His light and His joy,
in this world and the next. And
the blessing of God Almighty; The
Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit be upon you, and remain
with you always. Amen.”

(During the above, the doors at the back have opened
abruptly, and a severe-looking bearded man in black leather
has entered. He takes off a woollen hat to reveal a bald
head. The family turn to look at him.)
118.

VICAR (CONT'D)
You are welcome.

(CARL - for it is he - sits in the second row, immediately
behind TOM and GERRI.)

(The VICAR, having finished, leaves the pulpit. More
recorded music commences ('Nimrod', Variation 9 from
Elgar's ‘Enigma Variationa’). The VICAR leaves the chapel.)

(TOM, JOE, and RONNIE get up. So does CARL.)

CARL

You're joking, aren't you?
TOM

Hello, Carl.

(He shakes CARL's hand.)

CARL
Is that it?

GERRI
It's all over, Carl.

(She gets up)

GERRI (CONT'D)
I'm really sorry.

(CARL watches the family go out. He looks round the chapel.
The MOURNERS leave. He follows them.)

Outside the chapel, moments later. TOM, GERRI and RONNIE
come down the steps. CARL overtakes them. JOE is already in
the grounds, looking at some wreaths. The funeral
attendants stand by the car nearby.

CARL
Unbelievable!

(He confronts TOM, GERRI and RONNIE.)

CARL (CONT’D)
Why couldn't you wait?

TOM
There's another one coming up
behind us. You can't wait.

CARL
What, you can't wait five
minutes?
TOM
No.

GERRI
We did ask them.

TOM
We asked them.

CARL
Outrageous.

TOM
What happened to you?

CARL
Motorway was fucked up, wasn't
it?

TOM
You should have taken that into
account, shouldn't you?

CARL
I did.

TOM
Obviously not enough.

CARL
(To RONNIE) I'll never forgive
you for this. You know that,
don't you?

RONNIE
Yeah, don't blame me.

TOM
It's not his fault.

RONNIE
I might have known you'd pull a
stunt like this.

(CARL moves away. JOE joins him.)

JOE
Carl.

CARL
What?

JOE
It's Joe.

CARL

(uninterested) Oh, yeah. Right
120.

(JOE walks away. GERRI joins CARL, and kisses him on the
cheek. )

GERRI
Carl, I'm really sorry. We're
going back to the house, to your

mum's.

CARL
I’ve got to go back there any
road, so...

GERRI

Alright. We'll see you there.

CARL
Yeah.

(CARL leaves. GERRI and TOM talk to the MOURNERS. We half-
hear the conversation - that is, they all speak quietly,
and we are some distance away.)

TOM
Hello, I'm Tom. Ronnie's brother.
We're going back to the house if
you'd like to join us.

GERRI
Hello, are you friends of
Linda's? How long have you worked
with her? Are you coming back to
the house. Good. Alright, we'll
see you there.

MAN
Aye, I will. Thank you.

TOM
Do you have your own car? Did you
have transport? Do you know the
way?

GERRI
We’ll see you there.

(TOM and GERRI walk towards the car. JOE has already got
in. The three MOURNERS go off together in another
direction. )

Back in RONNIE’s house, in the living-room. GERRI sets out
bought sandwiches on a coffee-table, removing the plastic

lids. JOE and RONNIE are sitting at the table. TOM stands.
TOM and GERRI have mugs of tea. RONNIE has a beer. So does
JOE.
121.

GERRI (CONT'D)
When was the last time you saw
Carl?

RONNIE
A couple of years ago.

TOM
Just turns up out of the blue,
doesn't he?

RONNIE
When he can be bothered.
JOE
When did we last see him?
TOM
Can't remember. Five, ten years
ago?
GERRI
It was the year your mum died.
TOM
Was it?
GERRI
Mm.
RONNIE
1979.
TOM
No.
GERRI
No.
JOE
No, ninety-five.
TOM
Yeah.
RONNIE

Don't know.

JOE
So, hang on - when did he stay
with us in London?

TOM
That was in the eighties.

GERRI
You were nine.
122.

JOE

He always wore black, didn't he?
GERRI

Mm... It's tragic. He was such a

lovely kid. Full of fun.

RONNIE
Was ‘e?

(He takes a swig of beer.)

JOE opens the front door, revealing the three middle-aged
MOURNERS.

JOE
Hi. Come on in.

FIRST WOMAN
Thanks, love.

(They start to enter. TOM appears.)

TOM
Hello, come in.

FIRST WOMAN
Hiya.

TOM
D’you want to go through?

SECOND WOMAN
Thank you.

TOM
(To MAN) You find it, alright?

MAN
Aye, aye. No problem.

TOM
Shall I take your coat?

(JOE closes the front door.)
MAN
Er... No, you're alright, duck,
thanks.

(TOM and the MOURNERS have gone through to the living-room.
JOE stays near the front door to check his mobile.)
(JOE sees

(He picks

123.

TOM
(off) Shall I take your coats,
ladies? Right.

GERRI
Joe, is there another chair in
there?
a chair.)

JOE

Yeah.

it up, and takes it into the living-room. )

A little later. Tea and sandwiches. People variously
sitting and standing.

(Pause)

SECOND WOMAN
It was a very nice service.

TOM
It was, wasn't it? Simple,
straightforward. That's what you
wanted, wasn't it, Ronnie?
Nothing fancy.

RONNIE
No.

SECOND WOMAN
Good job it didn't rain.

(TOM and GERRI laugh politely)

TOM
Yes. It's a nice spot, that,
isn't it?

SECOND WOMAN
Hmm.

TOM
We've seen a few off from there,
haven't we?

MAN
Aye, we have over the years. Aye.

GERRI
Have you worked with Linda for
long at the bakery?
124.

SECOND WOMAN
About ten years.

GERRI
How about you, Maggie?

FIRST WOMAN (MAGGIE)
Not as long as that, no.

GERRI
She was a lovely lady.

FIRST WOMAN
She was, yeah.

SECOND WOMAN
We weren't that close.

FIRST WOMAN
She'll be much missed.

SECOND WOMAN
It was such a shock.

TOM
Be a big change for you, won't
it, Ronnie? Having to look after
yourself.

MAN
You get used to it though,
Ronnie. Eight years for me, now.

TOM
Is it?

MAN
Aye.

(We hear the sound of a key in the front door.)

JOE
It's Carl.

(CARL enters the house. He slams the door. He is wearing
his black woollen hat. He takes off a pair of shades and a
headset, and goes into the living-room. )

GERRI
Alright, Carl?

(CARL strides through the room.)

TOM
Eh up, Carl.

CARL
(To the MAN) Excuse me, mate!
125.

JOE
D’you want a drink, Carl?
TOM
You got tea, beers... couple of

bottles of wine.

CARL
Sort meself out, ta.

(He crosses the room, and goes into the kitchen.)

TOM
Are you local then, Frank?

MAN
Aye, aye, I'm just a few streets
down. You know, Almond Street.

TOM
Oh, yeah. I haven't lived in
Derby for forty years.

(GERRI joins CARL in the kitchen.)

GERRI
How are you, Carl?

CARL
I'm alright. How are you?

GERRI
We're all fine.

TOM
(off) We got up a fair bit when
my mam was still alive.

GERRI
This must have been a bit of
shock for you.

CARL
I'll say.
GERRI
Where you living?
CARL
Up in Yorkshire.
TOM
(off) ...not now...
GERRI

Are you working?
126.

CARL
Don't need an interrogation.

TOM
...there’s a new ring road... one-
way system...

(CARL picks up a pile of letters.)
GERRI
Well, there's food out here when
you want it.

SECOND WOMAN
(off) It’s all changed...

(CARL comes to the kitchen doorway, and hits RONNIE on his
leg with the mail.)

CARL
No post for me, then?
RONNIE
No. None from you, either.
CARL
Eh?
RONNIE
There's none from you.
CARL
Not lost your sense of humour,

then?

(He throws the letters down in the kitchen, and returns to
the doorway.)

CARL (CONT’D)
Who sorted all this lot out?

GERRI
We did.
TOM
We brought it with us.
CARL
From London?
TOM
Yeah.
CARL

Nice. You didn't get your arse in
gear then, Ronnie?
127.

TOM
He didn't need to - we offered.
CARL
Did you?
TOM
Yeah.
CARL
It's his responsibility, though
in't it?
TOM

I don't think you should
underestimate the shock he's had,
Carl.

CARL
Yeah, I know. Very fragile, in't
‘e, your brother?

TOM
His wife's just died.

CARL
His wife. Didn't much care for
her when she was alive.

TOM
Did you?
CARL
I beg your pardon?
TOM
Did you care for her, Carl?
GERRI
Tom!
CARL
I cared for her in me own way.
RONNIE
Carl!
TOM
What way was that, then?
CARL
She knew how I felt about her.
TOM
Did she?
RONNIE

Shut it!
128.

CARL
(To RONNIE) Don't tell me how to
behave in me own house!

TOM
It's not your house, though, is
it?

CARL
It's my house just as much as it
is his.

GERRI
Tom!

(TOM shrugs and sees fit to hold his peace.)

CARL
(To JOE, who is standing beside
him.) And what are you looking
at?

JOE
I'm looking at you, Carl.

CARL
Well, I don't like it.

(Now JOE sees fit to hold his peace, and takes a sip of his
beer. CARL turns on the SECOND WOMAN. )

CARL (CONT'D)
Don't feel like you need to hang
about, duck.

FIRST WOMAN
We'd best get going.

CARL
Excuse me.

(He crosses the room and goes upstairs.)

GERRI
I'm really sorry about this.

(They all get up.)
TOM

(peeved) Do you want your coats?
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

(He gets their coats.)

GERRI
Thank you for coming.
129.
MAN
Shall I drop you off?

FIRST WOMAN
Yeah. Thanks.

GERRI
You're welcome.

(RONNIE stands up, perplexed.)

TOM
Is that... can you do that,
Frank?

MAN

Aye. Aye. Give them a lift home.

TOM
That's great.

(At the front door. TOM and RONNIE see them out.)

FIRST WOMAN
Look after yourself, Ronnie.

(She goes out, followed by the other two.)

TOM
Thanks for coming. Sorry about
this. One of those things.

MAN
Ah, well. Not to worry, duck.

SECOND WOMAN
See you.

TOM
Thanks a lot. Take care. Ta-ta.

(He closes the door behind them, and sighs. He passes
RONNIE, then stops by him.)

TOM (CONT'D)
(exhales) Bloody hell. Are you
alright, Ronnie?

(He gently taps RONNIE's shoulder. RONNIE looks at him,
bewildered. )

RONNIE
I don't know what to do.

TOM
Ah, sod him. He'll bugger off
soon enough.
130.

(A look of terror in RONNIE's eyes. TOM hugs him. RONNIE
slowly responds. Pause. The TOM disengages himself.)

TOM (CONT'D)
Tell you what. Why don't you come
back with us? To London.

RONNIE
No, no. You're alright.

TOM
Well, why not? Just for a few
days, a week. Whatever it takes.
Then we'll put you on the train
back home.

RONNIE
I don't know...

TOM
Well... Think about it.

(He leaves RONNIE, who is lost, confused and in pain.)

A few moments later, in the living-room. RONNIE joins TOM,
GERRI and JOE.

TOM (CONT'D)
What d’you reckon?

GERRI
You might as well, till you feel
a bit better.

RONNIE
Are you sure?

TOM
Yeah.

GERRI
Mm.

RONNIE
Okay.

TOM
Good.

GERRI

Chuck a few things in a bag. (To
JOE) We'll clear up.

(CARL returns, from upstairs.)
131.

JOE
Yeah.

TOM
Have you got a bag?

RONNIE
Think so.

GERRI

Carl, your dad's coming home with
us for a couple of days.

CARL
Is he, now?

(GERRI and JOE start to clear up.)

RONNIE
I think there's one under the
bed.

TOM
Right.

CARL

How did she go?

RONNIE
Eh? (Pause.) She were dead when I
woke up. Satisfied?

(TOM goes upstairs. GERRI starts to collect some dirty
cups.)

GERRI
Excuse me, Carl.

(CARL takes the cups.)

CARL
I'll do that, Gerri.

GERRI
No, I'll do it.

CARL
No, you leave it. You sit
yourself down.

(He goes into the kitchen. GERRI, JOE and RONNIE watch him.
We hear a crash of crockery.)

CARL (CONT'D)
What am I doing this for? Save me
mam the trouble? She's fucking
dead now!
132.

(He storms past GERRI and JOE.)

GERRI
Carl, listen to me.

(She puts a hand on his shoulder. RONNIE goes upstairs.)

CARL
No, no, no, no, no.

(He collects his coat.)
CARL (CONT'D)
I'm going to get a bottle of

wine.

JOE
Carl, we've got loads of wine.

(CARL storms through the room, towards the front door.)

GERRI
Carl!

(CARL leaves, slamming the door behind him.)
(Pause. )

JOE
He won't be back.

(GERRI walks away from JOE.)

Up in RONNIE’s dark bedroom. TOM is packing an old
suitcase. RONNIE stands, watching.

TOM
Pyjamas... get some shirts. Are
you gonna change?

RONNIE
Yeah.

TOM
D’you want this?

RONNIE
Yeah.

(TOM gives him a clean shirt on a hanger. Then he folds and
packs another couple.)
TOM
How're you doing? Are you
alright?

RONNIE
Yeah, I'll be alright.

TOM
We'll be off soon.

At the allotment. A very cold and frosty day. GERRI is
pulling up wooden stakes, and TOM is stacking planks by the

shed.

Meanwhile, RONNIE sits quietly on their living-room sofa.
Pause. There is a knock at the front door. Slowly, RONNIE
gets up. He goes to the door, and opens it very slightly.

MARY is on the step. She is uncharacteristically
dishevelled. Hair awry. No make-up. Old clothes.

MARY
Oh, hi. Is Gerri in?
RONNIE
No.
MARY
Oh. Is Tom here?
RONNIE
No, they're out. What's it about?
MARY
I... I... I just wanted to see
‘em.
RONNIE
They didn't say nothing.
MARY
Oh... oh no, they don't... I just

came on the spur of the moment.
I'm a friend of Gerri's, I work
with her. Oh, have... have they
gone to the allotment?

RONNIE
Yeah.
134.

MARY
Yeah. Er... Can I come in? Just
to wait for them?

RONNIE
I don't know.
MARY
I'm really cold.
RONNIE
I'm here on me own.
MARY
Oh... I'm not going to burgle

you, or anything. I can give you
a description of the house, if
you like. When you go in the

kitchen,... the cooker's on the
right... and the sink's straight
in front of you, and on the left
is... a little cupboard -

RONNIE
Yeah, yeah.

MARY
Thanks.

(He lets her in, and shuts the door. Pause.)

MARY (CONT'D)
I'm Mary. What's your name?

RONNIE
Ronnie. Tom's me brother.

MARY
Oh. Oh - is it... your wife
that's just passed away?

RONNIE
Yeah.

MARY
I'm really sorry.

RONNIE
That's alright.
MARY
Would you like me to make you a

cup of tea?

RONNIE
No, thank you.
135.

MARY
Is it alright if I make one for
myself? I don't think Gerri and
Tom would mind.

RONNIE
Alright.

(He watches her go into the kitchen. She puts her bag on a
chair, and smiles at him. She sets about filling the
kettle. RONNIE goes slowly into the kitchen. MARY goes to
the fridge to get the milk.)

MARY
Have you come down for a few
days?

RONNIE
Yeah.

MARY

Yeah. I haven't had any
breakfast. Did you have

breakfast?
RONNIE
Yeah.
MARY
With Tom and Gerri?
RONNIE
Yeah.
(Pause. )
MARY
D’you want a cuddle?
(Pause. )

MARY (CONT'D)
You sure you don't want some tea?

RONNIE
Aye, go on.

MARY
Yeah.

(She proceeds to make the tea.)

Now they are both sitting at the kitchen table, each with a
mug of tea.
(Pause. )

(She sips

(Pause. )

136.

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh, that's better. It's really
lovely to be here. I haven't been
for months. They invite me a lot -
we're really old friends. Are you
sleeping in Joe's room?

RONNIE
Yeah.

MARY
Oh, yeah. All his little bits and
bobs. Did he go to the funeral?

RONNIE
Yeah.
MARY
With his girlfriend?
RONNIE
No.
MARY
Oh.
RONNIE

They're coming round later.

MARY
Oh, are they? (Pause.) Sorry I'm
such a mess. I didn't get to bed
‘til five. And then I couldn't
sleep. I just got up and came
straight here.

her tea.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Does Gerri ever mention me?

RONNIE
No.

MARY
Mary.

RONNIE
No.

MARY

You look like Tom.
137.

RONNIE
Oh, aye?

MARY
Yeah. You've got a nice face.
Tom's got a nice face, too. What
was your wife's name?

RONNIE
Linda.

MARY
Oh? Was she nice.

(RONNIE doesn't reply. He sips his tea.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Did you have dinner last night?

RONNIE
We had chicken.

MARY
Oh, lovely. They're good cooks,
aren't they?

RONNIE
Yeah.
MARY
I can't cook. Can you cook?
RONNIE
No.
(MARY laughs)
MARY
I didn't really eat anything
yesterday.
RONNIE

D’you want some toast?

MARY
No, I'm alright, thank you. I
wouldn't mind a cigarette,
though. Do you smoke?

RONNIE
Yeah.

MARY
Oh, good.

(RONNIE takes out a tin of tobacco.)
138.

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh, yeah. My friend used to roll
her own.

(He starts to roll one up.)

RONNIE
D’you want one of these?

MARY
Oh no, it's alright. I'll have
one of mine. Oh, no - go on,
then. For old time's sake.

RONNIE
Huh.

(She watches him.)

RONNIE (CONT'D)
We have to go out there.

MARY
Oh, we can stay in here, can't
we? They won't know.

(Pause. RONNIE doesn't react.)

In the conservatory. RONNIE and MARY are standing by the
plants with their mugs. They are smoking their roll-ups.
RONNIE has put on his coat.

MARY (CONT'D)
Takes me back. Did you ever smoke
dope?

RONNIE
Tried it a few times.

MARY
We used to. Me and my best
friend, Monica. Don't see her
anymore. Did you like the
Beatles?

RONNIE
They were alright. I was more
Elvis. Jerry Lee Lewis...

MARY
Yeah. (Sings) “I'm all shook up.”

RONNIE
Heh.
139.

(MARY giggles)

(Pause. )

(Pause. )

(Pause.

MARY

Have you got any children?
RONNIE

Got a son.
MARY

Is he married?

RONNIE
Don't know.

RONNIE (CONT'D)
You got kids?

MARY
No. Unfortunately. Have you got
to go back soon?

RONNIE
Yeah. Got a few things to sort
out.

MARY
I don't suppose your son will
help you.

RONNIE
No.

MARY
I could come up and give you a
hand, if you like... Have you got
to move?

RONNIE
No.

MARY

I could take a few days off work.

RONNIE
Are you warm enough?

MARY
Oh... I'll be alright. We'll just
finish these.

They smoke.)

MARY (CONT'D)
Oh... do you know Ken?
140.

RONNIE
Ken? Yeah.
MARY
Yeah. Did he go to the funeral?
RONNIE
No.
MARY

He's a bit weird, isn't he?

RONNIE
Is he?

(Pause. MARY thinks better of pursuing this, and lets it
go.)

MARY
I don't really smoke. I had too
much to drink last night. I had a
bit of a bad day. My car broke
down. It had to be towed away.
They said it wasn't worth
repairing. They gave me twenty
quid for it.

RONNIE
That's not much.

MARY
No. What can you do with twenty
quid? I bought myself a bottle of

champagne.

RONNIE
Yeah?

MARY
Yeah.

RONNIE

Did you finish it?

MARY
Yeah, I did.

RONNIE
Huh.

(MARY sniffs a bit.)
MARY
I might have to have a little bit
of a lie-down.

(Pause. )
141.

In the living-room. MARY is lying comfortably on the sofa.
RONNIE is sitting on the other side of the room.

MARY (CONT'D)
It's really lovely to have
someone to talk to.

RONNIE
Yeah.

MARY
It's peaceful here. I might move

away somewhere else. Start again.
I used to work in Mallorca.

(RONNIE looks out of the window.)

RONNIE
They'll be back soon.

(MARY sits up.)

MARY
Oh, yeah.

(Then she settles back again.)

TOM and GERRI unload stuff from the car.

TOM
There you go.

GERRI
Thank you.

(Tom locks the car. They walk up the path, and enter the
house. )

TOM
(calling) Hello, Ronnie!

GERRI
(calling) We're back!

(GERRI looks into the living-room and sees MARY.)

MARY
Hi, Gerri.
142.

GERRI
Hello, Mary.

(TOM joins GERRI.)

TOM
Bloody hell!

MARY
Hi, Tom.

GERRI

What are you doing here?

MARY
Well, I just... thought I'd...

(GERRI looks at her for a moment, then goes.)

TOM
Just get my boots off.

In the kitchen...

(He opens

(They put
to change
forehead.

(She goes
her.)

TOM (CONT'D)
Where'd she spring from?

the conservatory door.)

GERRI
Bloody nuisance. Specially today.

TOM
You're not kidding.

down their allotment stuff. TOM sits in a chair
his footwear. GERRI stops, sighs, and rubs her
MARY comes in.)

MARY
Are you alright, Gerri?

GERRI
Yes, Mary. I'm fine.

to the hall to take her coat off. MARY watches

TOM
D'you drive?

MARY
Oh... No, I came on the tube.
143.

TOM
Did you?

(GERRI returns)
GERRI
It might have been nice if you'd
phoned first, Mary.

MARY
Oh, I'm really sorry.

(TOM comes into the kitchen, and closes the conservatory
door. He passes MARY, taking off his hat and coat, and goes
to the hall. GERRI takes the milk out of the fridge.)

GERRI
Joe and Katie are coming.

MARY
Yeah, Ronnie said.

(GERRI looks at MARY, then walks away. RONNIE comes in,
followed by TOM, who pats him on the shoulder.)

TOM
Matey...

(TOM joins GERRI at the other end of the kitchen. MARY
looks at RONNIE but he doesn't particularly respond.)

TOM (CONT'D)
Tea, Ronnie?

RONNIE
Yeah.

(RONNIE moves off to join the others. MARY stands alone.)
GERRI
Come and sit yourself down, Mary,
and have a cup of tea.

(She joins them)

Later. Alone, in the living-room, RONNIE flicks through
several TV channels.

Upstairs in Tom’s study, he is working at his computer.
GERRI comes in and puts her arms round him.
144.

GERRI (CONT'D)
How's it going?

TOM
Inexorably.

GERRI
I don't know what to do.

TOM
Well, if you don't, I don't.

GERRI
I can't just chuck her out.

TOM
Can't you?

GERRI
(Chuckling) No! Look at the state
of her.

TOM
I know, poor woman. Joe and
Katie’ll be alright - they can
handle her.

GERRI
I know. I've got enough food.

TOM
Have you? That's alright, then.

GERRI
Oh, well. Here goes.

(She leaves. TOM carries on working.)

MARY is sitting at the kitchen table, her head in her
hands. We hear GERRI coming down the stairs. She enters,
goes to the wooden dresser, opens a drawer, and takes out
some place-mats. She puts these on the table.

MARY
D’you want me to give you a hand?

GERRI
No, thank you, Mary. Would you
like to stay for a bite to eat?

MARY
No, it's alright. I don't want to
be in the way.
145.

GERRI
You won't be. We've got plenty of
food.

(She takes some wine-glasses from a shelf.)

MARY
Are you still angry with me?

GERRI
Mary, I wasn't angry with you. I
just felt you'd let me down.

MARY
Oh, Gerri... (She gets up) I'd
never want to do that. I'm really
sorry.

GERRI
Yes, and I know you've
apologised.

MARY
I miss you. I mean, I know that I
see you at work, but we don't
seem to talk to each other any
more. I feel terrible.

GERRI
This is my family, Mary. You've
got to understand that.
(MARY starts to cry)

MARY
I do.

(GERRI puts down the glasses.)

GERRI
Oh... Come here.

(She embraces MARY. They hug. MARY sobs deeply.)

GERRI (CONT'D)
You have to take responsibility
for your actions.

MARY
(Sobbing) I know.

(GERRI disengages herself slightly, and looks at MARY
directly.)

GERRI
Now, listen Mary. You need to
talk to somebody.
146.

MARY
Oh, no, I don't want to do that.

GERRI
Well, I think it would help you.

MARY
I just want to talk to you.

GERRI
Why don't I have a word with one
of my colleagues?

MARY
As long as we're friends, then
I'm alright.

GERRI
Well, that's beside the point.
You need independent professional
help. You'd be much happier.
Let's talk about it on Tuesday,

shall we?
MARY
Yeah.
GERRI
And you have a think.
MARY
Yeah, we could have a drink.
GERRI
Why don't you help me lay the

table?
(MARY starts to set out the place-mats)

MARY
He's really nice, Ronnie, isn't
he?

(GERRI doesn't reply. She continues to put out the glances,
glancing at MARY for just a moment. MARY has finishes her
task. She stands helplessly.)

Later. It is still light. Using his key, JOE comes through
the front door, following by KATIE, who is wearing a
woollen hat and a long scarf. GERRI comes out of the living-
room.
147.

GERRI
Hello! I saw you through the
window. (She embraces JOE)

KATIE

Hello!
JOE

Hello, how are you?
GERRI

I'm fine - how are you?
JOE

I'm good.
GERRI

(embracing KATIE) Katie! Lovely
to see you!

KATIE
Aw... lovely to see you. How are
you?

GERRI
Fine.

(GERRI points to the living-room, and indicates silently
that MARY is present. KATIE does a momentary comic mock
exit towards the front door. TOM appears.)

TOM
Hello!

JOE
Aha!

(He gives TOM a bottle of wine.)

TOM
Aha!
KATIE
We brought you some chocolates.
GERRI
Oh!
TOM

Good. Ha! ha!

(He grabs the chocolates from KATIE and runs off with

them. )

KATIE
Oh no! Give them back! Give them
back!
148.

JOE
You'll never see them again!

(He walks away.)

GERRI
Can I take your things?

KATIE
Yeah - cheers.

(GERRI and KATIE share silent humour about MARY's presence.
KATIE mimes hanging herself with her scarf, with an
appropriate funny face. TOM joins them. KATIE takes off her
coat, followed by her scarf. TOM takes them.)

KATIE (CONT'D)
(while she takes it off) I've got
the longest scarf in the world -
sorry! Tea cosy on my head!

(TOM takes her stuff away.)

GERRI

Come and meet Ronnie.
KATIE

Ah, great!
GERRI

Mary's here.

KATIE:
Oh!

(They go into the living room, followed by JOE and TOM.)

KATIE
Hi, Mary! How are you?

MARY
Good, thanks.

KATIE
Excellent.

MARY
Hi Joe.

JOE
Hi.

(MARY kisses him.)
KATIE

Hi, you must be Ronnie.

(She shakes his hand.)
149.

KATIE (CONT'D)
I've heard a lot about you.
Lovely to meet you.

RONNIE
Hello.

JOE
This is Katie.

TOM
My big brother!

KATIE
Ah...

(MARY sits on the sofa.)

GERRI
Right, what are we having to
drink?

KATIE
I'll have what everyone else is
having.

TOM
Red wine for me.

GERRI
We're having fish.

JOE
I'll have white, then.

KATIE
Actually, I'll have white wine as
well, please.

TOM
Beer, Ronnie.
RONNIE
Er, yeah.
GERRI
White wine, Mary?
MARY
Er, yeah, please, if that's
alright.
TOM

I'll do that, Gez.

JOE
I'll get you a beer, Ronnie.
(GERRI, JOE and TOM leave.)

KATIE
So, I hear you're a massive Derby
fan, Ronnie.

RONNIE
Er, yeah.

KATIE
Great club. I'm a Palace
supporter myself, for my sins.
But I'm still holding onto the
hope we might crash back through
to the Premiership, at some

point!
RONNIE
Yeah.
KATIE
What d’you reckon to Derby's
chances?
RONNIE

Oh... not so bad.

KATIE
Well, fingers crossed!

150.

(She crosses them. MARY sits, alone and lonely.)

Later. Outside the house. It is now dark. Light from within

the house. A cyclist passes.

In the kitchen. They are all round the table,
pudding course. The camera slowly circles the
TOM, GERRI, JOE and KATIE talk. For a while,
RONNIE or MARY.

TOM
We met on our first day at
university in Manchester.

KATIE
Oh, your first day!

TOM
We were in the same halls of
residence.

eating the
table, as
we don’t see
151.

GERRI
We met on the stairs.
TOM
Yeah.
KATIE
Really?
TOM

I was falling down them, she was
going up them.

GERRI
I was falling up them!

JOE
Well, things haven't changed,
then.

GERRI
And Tom's first job, when we left
uni, was abroad for two years.

KATIE
And you tried not to take it
personally, eh? (Laughs)

TOM
We came down to London, didn't
we, for about nine months.

GERRI
Yeah...

TOM
I got my first geologist's job in
Western Australia in the outback.

KATIE
Oh, right

JOE
It was just him and a load of
Australian cowboys.

TOM
Yeah. It was like the Wild West
out there.

KATIE
Yeah, all cork hats, was it, and
beers?

GERRI

You've worked in Australia,
haven't you, Katie?
152.

KATIE
Yeah, I worked in Sydney for a
year.

TOM
Oh, yeah?

KATIE
Oh, I had the most wonderful time
there. They know how to enjoy
themselves, don't they, the
Aussies?

TOM
Oh, yeah. And then you came out
and visited, didn't you, my first
Christmas holiday?

GERRI
Yes. Yes, and we spent Christmas
on the beach.

KATIE
Barbie on the beach?

TOM
Yeah, oh, yeah.

GERRI
And then when Tom had finished
after two years, I joined him
again, and we...

JOE
You went on your grand tour,
didn't you?

GERRI
...we came back overland.

TOM
Yeah, yeah. It took us seven
months, I think. We got the boat
from Fremantle to Singapore and

then...
GERRI
Yeah... Singapore
TOM

Singapore to Malaysia, and then
onto Thailand...

GERRI
Thailand... Burma.
153.
JOE
And to India.

(The camera is now on RONNIE, who is eating his pudding and
sipping his beer contentedly.)

TOM

Yeah.
KATIE

Oh, I'd love to go to India.
JOE

Stoned in India.
GERRI

We went trekking in Nepal.
KATIE

Really?
TOM

.-..Nepal, trekking in Nepal, the
beach at Goa. Wonderful, holiday
of a lifetime.

KATIE
Up and down Everest.

GERRI
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran.
Turkey....

TOM

Yeah, yeah - Turkey.

GERRI
Over to the Greek Islands...

TOM
Greek Islands. The wonderful
thing was, because I'd been two
years working in Australia, and
earning relatively good money,
and nothing to spend it on
really. So, we didn't have to do
it on a really tight budget.

(Now the camera is on RONNIE and MARY. She smiles at him
but he doesn't really respond.)

GERRI
Because some people could just
hitch, but we could get buses and
trains and stuff.
(Laughter.

154.

TOM
Yeah, yeah.

KATIE
It must have made a difference.

TOM
You've been to the Greek Islands,
haven't you, Mary?

MARY
Yeah.
TOM
Which island was it?
MARY
Corfu.
TOM
Yeah?
KATIE
What were you doing on Corfu?
MARY
Oh, I only... ran a bar, on the
beach.
JOE

You were a cocktail waitress,
were you?

)

MARY
Yeah. (She smiles)

(The camera is now only on MARY.)

GERRI
So, when are you going to Paris.

KATIE
Oh, a week on Friday. Can't wait.

JOE
Yes. We've got an early start;
six twenty-two train.

TOM
Oh, no!

JOE
Yeah.
155.

KATIE
We get in at Paris, what is
it....?

JOE

About quarter to ten?

KATIE
Yeah - nine-fifty.

JOE
Something like that. Have
breakfast by the Seine.

(The dialogue starts to fade out slowly.)

KATIE
Breakfast...

TOM
Have you got your hotel booked?

KATIE
Yeah, we've got a lovely hotel,
haven't we?

JOE
Very nice, yeah.
KATIE
Beautiful. In the Marais area.
TOM
Oh, yeah?
KATIE

It will be brilliant for our
Christmas shopping.

(MARY drinks some wine.)

TOM
When are you coming back?

KATIE
--- On the Sunday...

(The dialogue has now faded to total silence.)

(We hold on MARY, in her pain, for a while.)

SLOW FADE TO BLACKOUT

The End
