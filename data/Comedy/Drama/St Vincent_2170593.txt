By: Theodore Melfi
The sex sounds made during...sex.

FADE IN:

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

A bedroom stuck in the 1970's. Felt wallpaper, cigarette
smoke stains, thick dust. Pictures everywhere of a MAN
(VINCENT) and a WOMAN (SANDY) in love. They couldn’t
look happier. Young, full of life.

On the bed, a Russian woman with a tortured Brooklyn
accent, DAKA, rides on top of someone we’1ll soon meet.
Daka is lost in her 30s, rough, tattooed, too much
makeup, and somewhere underneath it all...beautiful.
Furthermore, she’s pregnant. Who knows how long, she’s
so damn skinny.

Grinding away.

DAKA
You eat the breakfast yet?

She’s talking to VINCENT (mostly VIN.) Whom she’s
riding. He’s the guy from the pictures, although now in
his 60s/70s. Beat-to-hell, raw, irreverent. He gave up
on life years ago.

VINCENT
(puffing a cigarette)
You didn’t eat?

DAKA
I forget.

VINCENT
How do you forget to eat?

DAKA
It happens so.

Vincent returns his gaze to...the TV on top of his
dresser. An old Abbott & Costello movie is playing.
Daka adjusts herself, continues grinding on Vincent.
Then...

VINCENT
You want go to breakfast?

Sure.

INT. NAT’S BROOKLYN DINER - LATER

A greasy spoon in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Vincent and
Daka are in a booth eating breakfast. Daka is scarfing
down Huevos Rancheros, like she hasn’t eaten in days.
VINCENT
I get reflux just looking at you.

DAKA
They have pill for this.

VINCENT
Bastards have a pill for
everything. That’s a fact, lady.
Killing us all, ten milligrams at a
time.

Vincent sifts through his pill pouch. Pulls out a dozen
or so...the day’s dose.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Where’s the water? Didn’t I ask
for water?

DAKA
Ask fuck again.

VINCENT
Coming here twenty years, still
can’t get their shit together.
Calling off to a Mexican server (JESUS.)

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Jesus. Aqua. Pills.

Jesus smiles, nods.

DAKA
I never take this pills.

VINCENT
Just crack and meth. That’s a
better plan.

DAKA
Fuck you, Vin. Stay off me.

She reaches across the table for his toast.

DAKA (CONT'D)
You want this toast.

Jesus returns with a glass of water. Lots of ice.

JESUS
Here you go, Mr. Vincent.

VINCENT
Can you put more ice in it? I want
to make sure I choke while I’m
swallowing my poison.

Jesus is confused.
DAKA
He don’t want this ice.

JESUS
Oh. Si.

VINCENT
Yeah. Oh, si. Just like everyday
I come in here. Aqua no hielo.

No one really knows what to say. They've heard it all
before. Daily.

JESUS
Uno momento, Mr. Vincent.

Jesus walks off, nonplussed.

VINCENT
Uno momento.

Vin takes a pill, swallows.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
What did Jesus say to the Mexicans
before he left?

DAKA
This I don’t know.

VINCENT
Don’t do anything till I get back.

Daka doesn’t laugh.

DAKA
You speak for Jesus is not right.

VINCENT
Really. From you?

Vin takes another pill. Swallows.

EXT. A BANK - DAY - LATER

Standard bank. Vin'’s car’s parked outside. A very old
convertible MG Spider in shit shape.

INT. THE BANK — CONTINUOUS

Vin’s sitting across from a mortgage counselor, TERRY.
He’s reviewing paperwork.

VINCENT
(pointing)
That one there. Says the line’s
been frozen.
Terry shuffles.

TERRY
Uh-huh. Got it. Yes. Let’s
see...so...with these reverse
mortgages you can only borrow a
percentage of the equity you have
in the house. That’s called the
loan-to-value.

VINCENT
Don’t need a financial seminar. I
own the damn thing outright. 40
years.

TERRY
Yes. Yes. Well...you did. But
now, Since you’ve been getting
monthly payments from us for the
last...

(searches the papers)
eight years...you’ve reached the
cash out limit. That’s that loan-
to-value thing I just mentioned.

VINCENT
The house is worth-

TERRY
It was worth. Whatever it was
worth. And I’m sure you know
housing prices have fallen
dramatically since the financial
crisis. Right. Unless you’ve been
living under a rock.

His attempt at humor...not appreciated.

VINCENT
You do stand-up?

Vin rises.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
This is my life here, pal. I need
that money.

TERRY
I’m sorry, Mr. Canatella. There’s
really nothing I can do. It is
what it is.

VINCENT
Everybody's says that now. You
know what it means, “You're fucked,
and will remain fucked.”

He walks off.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
I’m closing my accounts forthwith.
You don’t get my business another
day.

THE TELLER LINE - MOMENTS LATER

Vin waits in line, steaming. Ding. An electronic arrow
points him to TELLER WINDOW #23.

TELLER WINDOW #23 - CONTINUOUS
Vin hands TELLER #23 his ATM card.

VINCENT
I want to close this account.

TELLER #23
I’m sorry to hear that, sir. May I
ask why?

VINCENT
Lady. You're just a spoke on a
wheel, trying to make a living like
the rest of us schmucks. I don’t
want to tell you to go fuck
yourself. Let’s just leave it at
that.

TELLER #23
Okay.

Tap, tap, tap on the keyboard.
TELLER #23 (CONT'D)

That’s one hundred twelve dollars
and fourteen cents.

VINCENT
Small bills.

TELLER #23
No, sir...you’re overdrawn that
much.

VINCENT

What’s that mean?

TELLER #23
It means you don’t-

VINCENT
I know what overdrawn means.

TELLER #23
We've sent several notices.
VINCENT

So. I can’t close my account.
TELLER #23

You can, when you get it back to

zero.

Vin takes his card. What’s to say.

INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Vin labors into the car. Daka is waiting in the
passenger seat. He hands her a few crumpled bills.

DAKA
What’s this?

VINCENT
What’s what?

DAKA

My shit is not lay-a-way. I am no
JC Penny. Fuck face.

VINCENT
I’m a little tight right now. You
know I’m good for it.

Daka looks him over.

DAKA
I don’t make like before, Vin.
Only few freaks like the belly.
Understand.

She gets out of the car.
DAKA (CONT'D)
Have to save for maternity leave.
You asshole.
She heads off down the sidewalk.

VINCENT
See you next week.

DAKA
Extras when you do.

Daka moves on, bag in hand, adjusting her junk. Vin
drives off. A few NEIGHBORHOOD MEN whistle at Daka. She
yells back at them.

DAKA (CONT'D)
I’m not dog! Fuck face.
EXT. THE BUCK - NIGHT

The local dive bar. SMOKERS outside litter the sidewalk.
The windows are painted with “Happy New Year” greetings.

INT. THE BUCK - CONTINUOUS

Old neon. Older PATRONS. Vin sits at the bar next to
LINDA and GUS, a weathered married couple in their late
60s. They’re dressed to the nines. The hanging TV set
plays New Year’s Eve coverage from around the country.

They're all fairly lit...although Vin’s in a class by
himself. Very thick tongued.

LINDA
You have a good Christmas, Vin?

VINCENT
(slurring)
Best Christmas I ever had. No
people. No presents. No bullshit.
Just celebrating the birth of the
baby Jesus.

Tips his tumbler to heaven.

LINDA
Ah, you don’t mean that, Mister.

VINCENT
What do you know what I mean,
Linda? You a psychic now?

GUS
Ay, ease up there, Vinny. We're
just talking.

VINCENT
You should get a talk show. You’re
so damn good at it. The “Linda and
Gus Just Fucking Talking Talk
Show.”

Vin flags the bartender, ROGER.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Rog. Another Maker's.

Roger steps over.

ROGER
Vin...we got three hours till the
ball drops there. Why don’t we
give it a break for a minute.

VINCENT
Give what a break?
ROGER
The liquor.
VINCENT
You're not gonna serve me?
ROGER
For a minute.
VINCENT

You know how much money I’ve spent
in this dump over the years?

Roger tries to keep it smooth.

ROGER
Don't be like that, Vin. I’m
watching out for you here.

VINCENT
Watching out for me?

Vin stands, wobbles. He’s drunker than even he realized.

VINCENT (CONT'D)

You serve poison to people
everyday. So they can die while
they’re alive. Now you’re watching
out...is that right?

Gus stands, tries to help Vin.

GUS
Let me give you a ride home.

VINCENT
Don’t touch me, Gus. Do not touch
me. I will drive home drunk like
I’ve done every night Roger here’s
been watching out for me.

Vin pushes free, walks to the door.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Happy New Year.

He’s out.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

The Spider whips into the driveway. Hits the picket
fence on the neighbor's border. Crash. It topples.

Hits his own mailbox on the other side. Crash. It flies
onto the lawn. He puts the top up.

Vin shuts the car off. Sits for a minute. Then steps
out and swerves to the toppled mailbox. Gets on all
fours, opens the door, gets the mail...pounds of it.
INT. ENTRANCE HALLWAY - LATER

Vin stares at a mountain of unopened mail, overflowing a
basket. He empties the basket onto the floor, then
tosses the new mail into the empty basket. All sorted.

INT. VIN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Vin puts his feet up on a weathered coffee table,
watching TV from his paisley pattered couch. The decor
is feminine inspired, twenty years ago. Coverage of the
Times Square New Year's Eve Celebration plays.

Vin’s cat, FELIX THE CAT, jumps onto his lap. Starts to
pur.

VINCENT
There you are. Where’d you go

tonight, ha? You out catting
around...

He rubs the cat all over. His only love.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
I bet you’re hungry, aren’t you?

He takes Felix in his arms, shuffles to the kitchen.

THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

The kitchen is trashed: dishes to China, mold, stacks of
newspapers a decade old. Vin opens a can of gourmet cat
food. Dumps it in a bowl. Felix waits patiently on the
counter...the food arrives. He eats like there’s no
tomorrow.

Vin needs another drink. He holds his tumbler to the ice
maker in the fridge door. It grinds. No ice. He opens
the freezer door and grabs a glob of ice cubes stuck
together, puts them on the counter.

Grabs a hammer from the junk drawer.

BANG. BANG. He smashes the ice into pieces, chips fly.
BANG! He hits his finger.

VINCENT
UGHHHH. Shit. AHHHH.

Vin stumbles with the pain. His foot gets ever so close
to an ice chip on the tile floor...

Slip. Flip. Smack.

Vin flies up in the air, lands on the floor. Crack! His
head hits the tile hard. He’s out. Or dead.
10.

Felix looks at his owner. Jumps down beside him. Laps
up some blood.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

TV insert. The ball is dropping in Times Square. 5, 4,
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year. PEOPLE hug, kiss, celebrate.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

MEN screaming in Spanish. We pan away from Vin’s house,
over towards the source of the racket.

In the neighbor’s driveway, a moving truck is backing
into the drive and ripping tree limbs along the way.
Vin’s tree limbs. A LATIN MOVER is screaming
instructions to the LATIN DRIVER.
LATIN MOVER
Alto! Alto! You hit the tree,
man. Come on!

LATIN DRIVER
Meda, I can’t see it!

He notices the roof: pealed like a sardine can.

LATIN MOVER
You broke the roof! Ay Dios mio!

They fight on.

INT. KITCHEN - VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Vin'’s where we left him: face down on the kitchen floor.
A small pool of blood sits stagnant under his face.

The yelling outside irks him to consciousness.
VINCENT
Shut up out there. People are
sleeping.

He groans. Holds himself up. Felix the Cat stares from
a safe distance.

Vin sees the blood.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Ah, piss.

He feels his face, and for the first time we see it: he
looks like a prize fighter after the twelfth round.
11.

A gash above his eye is the origin of the blood. It
probably needs stitches. He’1ll never get them.

Vin sits there for a second, collects himself.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Vin walks outside, searching for the commotion. He
shields the sun from his eyes. The fighting Movers are
still at it.

VINCENT
Hey! Hey! What’s the problem?
This is a neighborhood. People are
sleeping.
The Movers stop. Stare.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
You comprende?!

Nothing.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Habla English?

LATIN MOVER
We speak English, senor.

VINCENT
What the hell are you doing here?

Vin looks up, notices the tree ripped.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
What the?!? That’s my tree you
assholes hit?!

There's a large tree limb sitting on Vin’s car and across
the fence (which he knocked down last night.)

VINCENT (CONT'D)
And my fence! My damn car!?!

Silence.

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Do you speak English!?!

Just then a car pulls up, parks in front of the house. A
WOMAN in her late thirties steps out. This is MAGGIE,
Vin’s new neighbor. She'd be prettier if she weren’t
always so worried.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
I’m calling the cops.

Vin heads inside.
12.

MAGGIE
Excuse me...
He turns.
VINCENT
What do you want?
MAGGIE
I'm Maggie. I guess I’m your new
neighbor.
Really.
VINCENT
So.
MAGGIE
Yes. We’re moving in today.
VINCENT
I noticed that. These dipshits
with you?
MAGGIE

They're with the moving company.

Maggie walks to the fence, stands on her side. Looks
around.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Oh, boy.

VINCENT
Oh, shit...more like it. That
fence is twenty years old. The
car’s forty. And the tree’s older
than me.

MAGGIE
I’m really sorry. I don’t know
what to...this is not the way to
meet.

She turns to the Movers.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Did you guys do this?

VINCENT
Of course, they did it. What are
you stupid? Look at the scene.

Maggie doesn’t take kindly to being called stupid.

MAGGIE
Excuse me. There’s no need to be
rude. Okay. I’m just moving in
here. I hired this company. Okay.
Accidents happen.
13.

A LITTLE BOY comes up to Maggie’s side. This is OLIVER.
Twelve. Frail. Four eyes. Painfully awkward and very
sensitive. He’s one of those invisible types.

VINCENT
Accidents happen. What’re you a
fucking adjuster?

Maggie puts her arm around Oliver.

MAGGIE
Do you mind, mister?

Vin looks at Oliver. Absorbs him.

VINCENT
That car’s an antique, missy.
Worth a lot of money.

She looks at the car. More like a piece of shit.

MAGGIE
I'll figure out how to-

VINCENT
You. You don’t have any money. No
offense. You don’t look like you
do. And I'll bet Chico and the Man
over there are “off the books.”
No, thank you, blondie, I’1l sue
the moving company.

Vin walks off.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
You can buck up for the tree and
the fence.

He hits the front door. Oliver looks up at his mom.

OLIVER
That’s our new neighbor.

MAGGIE
Yep.

OLIVER

It’s gonna be a long life.

INT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Oliver's bedroom. The room has a bed in it, little else.
The evening ritual is in progress: bedtime book time.

Although...Oliver is the one reading: “The Giving Tree.”
Maggie’s on a beanbag on the floor, nursing a Chardonnay.
14.

OLIVER

(reading)
“I wish that I could give you
something, but I have nothing
left.” I am just an old stump. “I
don't need very much now," said the
boy. “Just a quiet place to sit and
rest. I am very tired." "Well,"
said the tree, straightening
herself up as much as she could,
"Well, an old stump is good for
sitting and resting. Come, Boy, sit
down. Sit down and rest." And the
boy did. And the tree was happy.

Maggie drinks her wine.

She gets

MAGGIE
God, that’s depressing.

up.

OLIVER
No, it’s not. The old tree was
made to give. So to be able to
give everything and have nothing
left is the best life the tree
could ever have.

She tucks Oliver into bed. Kisses his forehead.

MAGGIE
That’s a nice way to look at it.
Need you to catch the bus tomorrow.

OLIVER
It’s my first day.

MAGGIE
Mine too. Can’t be late.

Maggie goes to turn off the light.

OLIVER
Where’s the bus line?

MAGGIE
Get on the internet in the morning.
You're good at that. Good night,
love.

OLIVER
Night.

She turns the light off. Oliver settles into the

darkness.
15.
EXT. CITY STREET - THE NEXT MORNING

Bus stop. Maggie’s old Corolla sits in the bus lane.
Oliver’s outside the door, leaning in the window. He’s
dressed in a Catholic School uniform. Maggie hands him a
lunch box.

MAGGIE
Peanut butter and bananas.

OLIVER
Thanks, mom.

MAGGIE

Snack money in the pocket. You
have your key?

OLIVER
Yes.

MAGGIE
Map?

OLIVER
Yes.

MAGGIE
What time you get out?

OLIVER
2:45.

MAGGIE
Straight home, ‘kay. Start your
homework.

OLIVER
Okay.

A bus pulls up behind Maggie.

MAGGIE
(re: the bus)
This is yours. See you tonight.

OLIVER
Wait. Ma...you’re not picking me-

MAGGIE
I’m in the bus lane, Oliver. Be
good. Okay. I don’t need another
ticket.
Maggie blows him a kiss, pulls off.

Oliver backs away from the curb, as the bus pulls in.
16.

INT. BUS - LATER

Riding the bus. Oliver's sandwiched between an OLD
JEWISH LADY and a PIERCED HIPSTER. He’s looking at a
Mapquest print out.

INSERT —- THE MAP: AN “X” MARKS THE SCHOOL’S LOCATION -
ST. FRANCIS de SALES.

EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - LATER

PACKS OF STUDENTS mosey towards the campus. A classic
brick and stone Catholic School.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

St. Francis de Sales Catholic School is just like any
other middle school. Diverse. Modern. Noisy. Dozens
of KIDS crowd the hallways, dig through lockers,
socialize with FRIENDS.

Oliver can’t open his locker. He tries the combination
again...no dice. He looks around for help. No one makes
eye contact.

The tardy bell chimes.

Oliver gives up, drags all his stuff with him. Rushes
down the hallway.

INT. BROTHER CRESPI’S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Religious Studies class. Brother Crespi stands in front
of THIRTY CHATTY PRETEENS. Crespi’s in his thirties,
preppy and full of new teacher idealism. Oliver stands
at his side, he could pass out.

BROTHER CRESPI
Settle down. I know it’s hard to
come back to school after three
weeks of vaca...but your education
must continue. Believe me, you
need it.

The kids settle in.

BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
This is Oliver. He’s joining us
mid-stream here at St. Francis.
We're happy to have him. Aren't
we..?

The CLASS speaks in unison, albeit bored and cynical.

ENTIRE CLASS
Welcome to St. Francis, Oliver.
17.

BROTHER CRESPI
Such genuine caring. Okay, Oliver,
why don’t you lead us in morning
prayer?

Shit. Oliver is frozen. The class stares.

BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
Everyone does it sooner or later.

Oliver’s turning red. He leans in to Brother Crespi,
whispers something in his ear.

OLIVER
I think I’m Jewish.

BROTHER CRESPI
Okay. That’s good.
(to the class)
Oliver thinks he’s Jewish.

A few KIDS speak out.

RANDOM KIDS
(on top of each other)
So am I. I’m Buddhist. There is
no God.

Brother Crespi raises his hands before it gets out of
control.

BROTHER CRESPI
We celebrate all religions in this
classroom. That’s why we’re
called...

The kids complete:

ENTIRE CLASS
(with fun sarcasm)
Religions of the World, with
Brother Cary Crespi.

BROTHER CRESPI
Bravo. Now, I happen to be
Catholic, which is the very best
religion in the world. Because we
have the most rules. But some of
us are Buddhist, Agnostic, Baptist,
Presbyterian, Christian, and “I
don’t know.” Which seems to be the
fastest growing religion on the
planet. And now we have Oliver.
Who “thinks he’s Jewish.” Which is
a new one for us as well. But...it
doesn’t preclude you from morning
prayer duty. Bow your heads.

Heads down. Oliver has no idea where to begin. Crespi
whispers to him:
18.

BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
Say anything you want. Doesn't
have to be special.
Oliver bows his head.

OLIVER
Dear...

Silence.
BROTHER CRESPI
(whisper)
God...etc, etc.

OLIVER
Dear God. Thank you.

More silence.
BROTHER CRESPI
(whisper)
Amen.

OLIVER
Amen.

The class repeats.

ENTIRE CLASS
Amen.

Oliver breathes. Crespi smiles at him.

BROTHER CRESPI
You made it. Go grab your seat.

Oliver walks to his desk.
BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)

Let's wipe the dust off that

textbook, young ones. Chapter

twelve. Catholic Saints.
Books shuffle. Pages turn. Oliver sits down. Beyond
embarrassed.
EXT. YONKERS RACE TRACK - DAY

Horse track. Shitty cars litter the lot.

THE TRACK BREEZEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Vin’s filing out his race form. He closes his eyes, puts
the form to his temple. Channels the racing gods. It’s
his ritual.
19.

TRACKSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

A TRUMPETER sounds the BUGLE CALL as JOCKEY’S on HORSES
settle in their stalls. The gates open...and they’re
off.

Vin’s sitting in “his” booth. Eating lunch. Drinking.
He’s always drinking.

VINCENT
Come on. Come on. Dig in.

The horses fly around the track.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Dig. One time. One damn time.

And just like that, Vincent’s horse...loses.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Son of a bitch.

He crumples up his race form. Throws it on the floor.
It lands at a MAN’S FEET.

MAN (0.S.)
No need to get pissy, Vincenzo.
You lose all the time. Should be
comfortable by now.

Vincent looks up and sees...Zucko. His bookie. Dirty
fingernails. Hairy eyeballs.

VINCENT
Yeah. Rough day.

Zaucko sits. Takes a pull of Vin’s Maker's.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Help yourself.

ZUCKO
I'm thirsty, Vin. And you owe me.

VINCENT
I don’t have it right now, kid.
Got a situation I’m working out.

ZUCKO
The thing is, if you’re breathing,
we all have situation. I’m not a
sole proprietor here, Vinny. Got
my own people to answer to. You
know that.

VINCENT
I just need a little time, you
know.
20.

ZUCKO
What do I tell ‘em?

VINCENT
A month.

ZUCKO

I always loved your jokes. They
kill me. You’re funny, Vin.

VINCENT
I always pay, don’t I?

Zucko hits Vin’s Makers again.
ZUCKO
Split the difference. Ya got two
weeks.
Zucko stands.
ZUCKO (CONT'D)
I hear the inside on the fifth is
“Lucky By Numbers.” Right. But
you got your luck. So. Go the
other way.

He leaves. Vin pushes his lunch aside. Appetite gone.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM - DAY

Gym class. Oliver’s straining with all his might, trying
to do a sit-up. A PARTNER holds his feet.

On the mat next to him, ROBERT OZINSKI, the school bully
reps through sit-ups like a rabid Marine.

COACH MITCHELL blows the whistle, asks the PARTNERS for
the count. Oliver’s Partner holds up one finger.
THE TRACK - LATER

Relay races. Ozinski sprints past the finish line. He’s
a specimen for a twelve-year-old.

Oliver is at the farthest end of the track. Running in
slow motion. He’s lapped by a SMALL ASIAN GIRL.
CHIN-UP BARS - LATER

Ozinski’s ripping off chin-ups like a baboon. As a-
matter-of-fact, he looks like one. KIDS count off:

fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

Oliver’s on the next bar, shaking like a leaf. He may
die.
21.

Finally, COACH MITCHELL blows the whistle. Oliver’s
Partner holds up a goose egg.

COACH MITCHELL
Time. All right. Good job,
kiddos.
Ozinski drops to the floor.

COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
We're done.

Exodus towards the lockers. Coach Mitchell taps Oliver,
who’s still hell-bent on getting his chin to that bar.
It’s not going to happen.

COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
You can let go now.

Oliver looks down at the drop. He’s chicken shit. Coach
grabs him by the back, lowers him like a feather.

OLIVER
Thank you.

COACH MITCHELL
You have PE at your last school?

OLIVER
Yes, sir.

COACH MITCHELL
Did you take it?

OLIVER
Yes, sir.

COACH MITCHELL
Go get changed.

Oliver walks away, in the wrong direction.

COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
The other way. Those doors.

He stops, looks. Changes direction.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Oliver enters the locker room. Most of the KIDS are
fully dressed already, and leaving. Ozinski starts
heckling the moment he sees Oliver.

OZINSKI
There’s the strong man.

Laughs. One of Ozinski’s buddies (BROOKLYN) chimes in.
22.

BROOKLYN
“I think I’m Jewish.”

More laughs. Oliver takes a seat in front of his locker.

OLIVER
My name is Oliver.

OZINSKI
(like a retard)
My name is Oliver.
Just then Coach walks in.

COACH MITCHELL
You guys hear that bell?

Silence.

COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
That means get moving.

Shuffling.

COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
Go on. Get to class.

They're off.
COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
(to Oliver)
You need a map?
Oliver nods.

OLIVER
No, sir.

COACH MITCHELL
Double time it or you'll be late.

Oliver nods. Coach walks off.

He opens his locker. It’s empty. His pants,
uniform...everything’s gone.

OLIVER
Shit.
EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES —- SIDEWALKS - LATER

School's out. KIDS everywhere: jumping in cars, riding
bikes, walking home.

It's easy to spot Oliver in the crowd, he’s the only
student wearing short gym shorts, a tank top and
sneakers.
23.

As expected, STUDENTS comment, laugh, text, chide. It’s
not been a good first day for Oliver.

He reaches the crosswalk. Looks up at the street sign,
it doesn’t look vaguely familiar. He crosses anyway.
MONTAGE OF OLIVER WALKING - LOST

-- Oliver crosses a major Boulevard. Cars everywhere.

-- He stops in the middle of a block. Looks around.

Then turns and goes back in the direction from wince he
came.

-- Oliver walks in front of a row of houses. A DOG tears
up and jumps on the picket fence, barking. Oliver runs
off.

-- Oliver reads a street sign. Thinks. Walks on.

INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Vin’s driving through major traffic. He pulls up next to
a bus load of PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS. They stare at him. He
stares back. The light turns green, the bus pulls off.

Then in tandem, the WHOLE WINDOW ROW OF KIDS flip him
off. Damn kids. Vin lights a cigarette.

OLIVER WALKING - CONTINUOUS

Finally, Oliver recognizes his block. He runs towards
what he thinks is his house. Looks...that’s it. He’s
home.

EXT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Oliver, at the front door, reaches into his pocket for
the key. Damn. He’s not wearing his pants. His key and
phone were in the pockets of his stolen uniform.

He could cry. But he’s not the type. He slumps down in
resignation and sits on the cold concrete steps.

VIN’S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Vin’s car pulls in haphazardly. He runs over some of the
toppled fence. Curses, with the windows up...so it

sounds like Charlie Brown’s parents.

Vin climbs out of the car. Walks to the fallen mailbox,
lowers himself onto the lawn, pulls mail out until...
24.

OLIVER
Sir?

Vin hears something. Stops, looks around. Confused.

VINCENT
Take me, God. Don’t play with me.

Oliver steps forward, down the walk.

OLIVER
It’s me, sir.

Vin squints. Finally sees the kid.

VINCENT
Yeah. What?

OLIVER
I was wondering if I could use your
phone?

VINCENT
My phone?

OLIVER
Yes.

VINCENT
In my house?

OLIVER
Yes.

VINCENT
For what?

OLIVER

To call my mom. I’m locked out. I
was in gym class and these kids
took my pants and I had my-

Vin cuts him off.

VINCENT
I don’t need the whole story.

Vin stares at the little shit. Pulls himself up off the
lawn.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
One call.

Vin walks away. Oliver walks across the lawn and through
the demolished fence into Vin’s yard.
25.
INT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Oliver’s on an old rotary phone in the kitchen. Vin’s
fixing a Maker’s Mark in the background.

Ring. Ring. Ring. Voicemail.
OLIVER
Hi, Mom. I...ah...lost my key for
the house. So, I’m at the old
guy’s next door.
Oliver turns to Vin.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Sir...what’s your name?

VINCENT
Vincent.
OLIVER
Vincent.
(whispers )

The mean one...

The conversation trails.

VIN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Vin’s sitting in his La-Z-Boy, facing Oliver on the
couch. Felix the Cat is sitting in Vin’s lap, staring at
Oliver. They don’t get much company around here.

The silence lasts forever. And ever.

A little longer.

Then...
VINCENT
What’s your name?
OLIVER
Oliver.
More silence.
VINCENT

Don’t you think it’s a little cold
for shorts?

OLIVER
It’s a long story, sir.

VINCENT
I’m sure it is.

Silence.
26.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
I don’t like “sir.”

OLIVER
Sorry, sir.

VINCENT
It’s okay.

Hmm. The phone rings.

THE KITCHEN — CONTINUOUS

Vin picks up the phone.

VINCENT
Yes.

INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

The CAT scan lab. Maggie’s in scrubs, whispering in the
corner of the room. ANOTHER NURSE is manning the
controls, as a PATIENT (seen through the glass) is slid

into the

INTERCUT

tube.

MAGGIE
This is Maggie, Oliver's mom. Is
this Vincent?

WITH VIN IN THE KITCHEN

VINCENT
Your kid’s here.

MAGGIE
Yes. I just got his message. Is
that all right?

VINCENT
Is what all right?

MAGGIE
That he stays there?

VINCENT
Stays here. Like what, stays here?

MAGGIE
I’m at work and...we got a few more
cases. So, I don’t get off for a
couple of hours and I can’t get him
the key anyway. I’m ina little
bit of a bind right now...

VINCENT
You want me to baby-sit?
27.

MAGGIE
Well, he’s hardly a baby. He won’t
bother you. He’1ll just do his
homework.

Oliver walks into the kitchen.

OLIVER
Sir?

Vin holds up his hand, shushes Oliver.

VINCENT
What’re you paying?

MAGGIE
Excuse me?

VINCENT
For baby-sitting. I’m not a
philanthropy.

MAGGIE
Okay...ten dollars an hour.

VINCENT
Twelve.

Maggie is amazed.
MAGGIE

Fine. Great. Can I talk to him?
Vin puts the phone down on the counter, walks off.

VINCENT
Hey. It’s for you.

Oliver walks to the phone, picks it up.

VIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Oliver and Vin are sitting on the couch watching an old
Abbott & Costello movie. Vin’s smoking, drinking.

Felix the Cat is sitting in Oliver’s lap. Vin’s not
thrilled.

VINCENT
He doesn’t like many people.

OLIVER
I’m good with animals, sir.

VINCENT
Yeah. He doesn’t usually like
people who say they’re good with
animals.
28.

Oliver laughs at the movie. It’s rare.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
You've never seen Abbott &
Costello?

OLIVER
No, sir. Are they old?

VINCENT
No. They’re dead. That’s the
oldest you can be.

OLIVER
Or the youngest. Time freezes when
you die.
Hmm.
VINCENT
Where’d you learn that?
OLIVER
A book.
VINCENT
What book?
OLIVER
A kid's book, sir. I doubt you
know it.
Little shit. Then...
VINCENT
It’s dinner time. You hungry or

something?
Oliver looks at Vin, studies his face.

OLIVER
A little, sir.

Vincent looks annoyed. He’s the kind of guy that gets
annoyed when someone wants something, even if he offered.

VINCENT
That figures.

KITCHEN - VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Vin’s scouring the kitchen, looking for something to feed
the kid. All he finds is a tin of sardines and a package
of Saltines. He cracks the sardines open. Arranges like
it’s sushi. Decorates a dirty plate with concentric
circles of sardines and stale crackers. Not bad.
29.
VIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Oliver’s eating a sardine cracker sandwich. Watching the
movie. Perfectly at home.

Vin’s drinking his dinner, a huge stack of mail sitting
on his lap. Bank statements, overdraft notices. He rips
them up, one by one. His idea of filing.

The doorbell rings.

VINCENT
Probably your mother.

OLIVER
Probably, sir.

Oliver doesn’t move.

VINCENT
I guess I’ll get that.

OLIVER
Thank you, sir.

Vin aches his way out of the recliner.

THE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Vin peeks out the peep hole, then opens the door
for...Maggie.

MAGGIE
Hi. Vincent.

VINCENT
Yep.

He doesn’t instinctively let her in.

MAGGIE
Thank you so much for watching
Oliver. I just started a new job
and...

VINCENT
I don’t need the whole story.

MAGGIE
Ok. Right.

Maggie digs in her purse and pulls out some cash.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Here. Three hours. Twelve dollars
an hour-

VINCENT
Thirty six.
30.

MAGGIE
Yes, I know.

She hands him two twenties.

VINCENT
I don’t have change. Of course.

Really.

MAGGIE
That’s...fine.

Vin counts the money, puts it in his shirt’s breast
pocket.

VINCENT
Where's his father?

That’s personal.

MAGGIE
Well. That’s a long story...see...

VINCENT
Don’t worry about it then.

A beat. We hear Oliver laughing in the background.
Maggie smiles.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
How come you don’t have anyone to
watch this kid after school?

MAGGIE
We just moved in-

VINCENT
I was there.

MAGGIE
Right.

VINCENT
You gonna pay for my fence?

MAGGIE
Of course.

VINCENT
And the tree?

MAGGIE

The tree? How-

VINCENT
Everything has a price. You're an
adult, you should know that.
MAGGIE
Okay. How much?
VINCENT
I‘ll figure out something fair.
A beat.
MAGGIE
Let me know.
VINCENT

I can the watch the kid too. After
school for a few hours. Same
price.

Maggie is speechless.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
I‘1l1 do eleven bucks an hour if you
supply the snacks. Little shit ate
my last can of sardines.

INT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - LATER

Maggie and Oliver sit at a tiny round table,
kitchen. Oliver is chowing down on a frozen

MAGGIE
You ate at Vincent’s house, no?
OLIVER
Can we buy some sardines, ma?
MAGGIE
Sure. Remind me next time we’re at
the store.
OLIVER
Okay.
MAGGIE
You like him?
OLIVER
Who?
MAGGIE
Vincent.
OLIVER

He’s interesting. In an old,
grouchy sort of way.

MAGGIE
That he is.

A beat.

31.

off the
dinner.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
You know, he offered to watch you
after school.

OLIVER
He did?

MAGGIE
Yep. I was thinking maybe that’s
not such a horrible idea. It’s
right next door. Would save me
having to find a baby-sitter.

OLIVER
You'll be home though. Right.

MAGGIE
Late mostly, baby. We have to eat.
I have to work. Your
father’s...not helpful. The new
school isn’t cheap.

Oliver eats, thinks.

OLIVER
I guess he’s too old to be
dangerous and not too old to be too
dangerous either. If you know what
I mean.

MAGGIE
That’s what I thought. Maybe we’ll
give it a whirl. See what happens.

OLIVER
Sure.

Then...
OLIVER (CONT'D)
Ma, are we still Jewish?
INT. BROTHER CRESPI’S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
Crespi, teaching.

BROTHER CRESPI
What is a saint?

Hands go up. Never Oliver’s. He’s doodling.

BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
Rachele.

A tiny ASIAN GIRL answers.
RACHELE

Individuals who display and act out
of exceptional holiness.

32.
33.

Damn.
BROTHER CRESPI
Okay. That’s pretty perfect,
Rachele. Thank you. Who can name
a saint?
Hands.

BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
Keesha.

KEESHA
St. Michael the Archangel.

BROTHER CRESPI
Great. He’s a classic. Jeremiah?

A LATIN BOY answers.

JERMIAH
St. Jude.

BROTHER CRESPI
Good one. What’s he known for?

JERMIAH
He has a hospital.

Laughs.

BROTHER CRESPI
He sure does. Okay, anyone know a
modern day saint? Bridgette?

A tall, athletic girl pipes up.

BRIDGETTE
Mother Theresa.

BROTHER CRESPI
Excellent. So...saints are human
beings we celebrate for their
dedication and commitment to other
human beings. For their
sacrifices. Their work to make
society better for those around
them and those that’1l come after
them.

A KID calls out from the back.

ANOTHER KID
You're a saint, Brother Crespi.

BROTHER CRESPI
Yes. I am. Thank you.

Crespi turns on the Smart Board. The title on the
presentation: “Saints Among Us.”
34.

BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
And so, our semester project is
thus aptly named: “Saints Among

Us.” You're going to research an
actual Catholic saint that inspires
you...

Oliver doodles a word: “Saint.”

INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - LATER

Lockers. Maggie is packing up to go home after a long
shift. Her supervisor, GLEN, finds her.

GLEN
Maggie.

MAGGIE
Hi.

GLEN

Robin called in sick today. Got
about six cases backed up.

MAGGIE
I’m sorry. I have to pick up my
son.

GLEN
Ah. Got it. It’s double time, you
know.

She needs the money.

GLEN (CONT'D)
Doesn't happen that often.

Thinks.

MAGGIE
Let me see what I can do.

INT. VIN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vin’s sleeping in his recliner. The phone rings. He
opens his eyes, agitated.

THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Vin picks up the phone.

VINCENT
Yeah?
35.

INTERCUT WITH MAGGIE IN THE HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM

Maggie’s on her cell phone. She hears Vin’s voice, hangs
up.
Vin hears the click.
VINCENT
Cowards. Try to sell me something,
go ahead.

He hangs up. Moseys back.

HOSPITAL BREAK / SNACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Maggie can’t do it. Glen the Supervisor comes in.

GLEN

You ready? We’re seven deep now.
MAGGIE

Oh. I’m-
GLEN

All good, right? I already told
scheduling we're all set.

MAGGIE
Yeah. It’s good. Let me just-
(motions to the phone)
Finalize...
Glen exits.

GLEN
No problem.

Maggie is stuck.

INT. VIN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Vin’s almost sleeping again...when that fucking phone
rings. His eyes pop open.
VIN’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Vin picks up the phone, battle ready.
VINCENT

What!?

INTERCUT WITH MAGGIE IN THE HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM

MAGGIE
Vincent?
36.

VINCENT
I’m gonna wait till you give your
whole spiel before I hang up.

Maggie has no idea how to respond.

MAGGIE
Vincent?
Vin’s equally confused.
VINCENT
Who is this?
MAGGIE
Maggie.
VINCENT
Maggie? That’s a good one.
MAGGIE
Your next door neighbor?
VINCENT
Who? Oh. What the hell do you

want?

EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - CARPOOL - LATER

School pickup. Oliver’s an ant amongst the THRONGS OF
KIDS waiting for a ride home. He’s buried in a book,

when Vin’s car putters in. A thorn amongst the black

Crossovers.

Vin scans the CROWD OF KIDS, spots Oliver. Honks his
horn. Way too long. Everyone stares. Oliver looks up.
Mortified.

INT. VIN’S CAR - LATER

Vin’s driving. Oliver’s still recovering. A large
basket of clean laundry sits between them.

VINCENT
Better buckle up.

OLIVER
You’re not buckled.

VINCENT
My life is my problem.

Oliver buckles.

OLIVER
This the way home?
37.

VINCENT
No.

Then...

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Let’s lay down some S.O.P. here.

OLIVER
I don’t know what S.O.P. means,
sir.

VINCENT

Standard Operating Procedure. You
go where I go. Do what I say. Get
your homework done somewhere along
the way. And most importantly,
don’t annoy me. I’m not happy when
I’m annoyed.

OLIVER
Are you annoyed right now?

VINCENT
Not particularly.

OLIVER
Really.

Vin stares at him. Smart ass.

EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN STORE - LATER

Vin pulls into a convenience store.

INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Parks.
VINCENT

Here’s a quarter. Call your mom,
tell her you’re wearing your seat

belt.

OLIVER
Costs more than a quarter.

VINCENT
Since when.

OLIVER

Since before I was born.

VINCENT
What’s wrong with this country.

Vin digs some more change out of the ashtray.
38.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
If it’s more than that, call
collect.

Vin's out, to the 7-Eleven.

EXT. SIDE OF THE STORE - LATER

Oliver’s dialing a number, when FOUR KIDS ON SKATEBOARDS
round the corner. It’s Ozinski, Brooklyn and TWO OTHER
PUNKS.

Oliver turns his back. That won’t work. They wheel
right up.

OZINSKI
Hey. It’s dipshit.

BROOKLYN
You live in this neighborhood?

Oliver doesn’t talk.

OZINSKI
Probably got detention cause a you.
Asshole.

OLIVER

You probably got detention because
you took my stuff.

OZINSKI
How do you know I took it?

Ozinski flips his skateboard into his hand, moves in.

OZINSKI (CONT’D)
Fucking narc.

INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Vin’s back at the car. Leaning on his door, smoking a

cigarette. Watching Oliver get knocked around. It’s

entertaining for him. And embarrassing.

EXT. SIDE OF THE STORE - CONTINUOUS

Ozinski slams Oliver hard into the payphone. His nose
starts bleeding.

OZINSKI
You're a bleeder.

BROOKLYN
I got a band-aid.
39.

Oliver does the unimaginable: he swings at Ozinski.
Well, rather, he slaps him in the face. Ozinski barely
moves.

OZINSKI
What was that supposed to be?

BROOKLYN
He just slapped you.

Oliver tries to run. Brooklyn slides his skateboard
under him, and the little guy goes flying to the
pavement.

Ozinski rolls up. Wheelies his board, pins Oliver's
chest.

OLIVER
Please...that hurts.

From around the corner, Vin’s voice.

VINCENT (V.O.)
What’re you little shit heels
doing?

They turn to see Vincent, holding a tire iron.

VINCENT
That you Robert Ozinski?

OZINSKI
No, sir. My name’s John.

VINCENT
Bullshit, you little prick. You’re
Reesa’s kid. Reesa Ozinski. I
recognize you from your fat Polish
nose.

Vin walks towards them.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Just like your prick father’s nose.
Guess the apple doesn’t fall too
far from the rotten tree.

Vin lights a cigarette.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
I got a deal for you little bully
shits. Whatever you do to the
little guy there...I’m going to all
of your mothers.

Vin smashes a skateboard with the tire iron. It
shatters.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Ride this!
40.

Scared to shit, the four haul-ass out of there.

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Get on, pencil dicks!

Vin walks up to Oliver. Looks down at him. Offers his
hand. Oliver hesitates.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
You need a paper invitation?

Oliver takes his hand. Vin pulls him up to his feet,
heads to the car.

INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Driving.
VINCENT
Who taught you...how to slap?
OLIVER
I don’t know. Just an instinct, I
guess.
VINCENT

Well, you should unlearn that.

Vin lights a cigarette.

OLIVER
I'm allergic, sir.

VINCENT
To what?

OLIVER

Cigarette smoke.

Vin rolls down his window, hangs his cigarette outside.
Keeps smoking.

VINCENT
Your father never taught you how to
take care of yourself?

OLIVER
No, sir. He’s a pacifist.

VINCENT
Kid, this country wasn’t founded by
tree huggers. That’s for sure.
You gotta stand up for yourself or
you get mowed down.

OLIVER
I’m small, if you haven’t noticed.
41.

VINCENT
So was Hitler.

OLIVER
That’s not a great comparison.

VINCENT
Indeed. Making a point though,
fella. Small means nothing. It’s
what you got in here.
Vin points to his head.

OLIVER
Or here, sir.

Oliver points to his heart. Vin looks at the little
fella. This kid’s got something.

EXT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - DAY

An expensive, well-kept convalescent center. Vin'’s car
pulls in and parks in a handicapped spot.

INT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - CONTINUOUS
Vin and Oliver are walking down the hallway. Oliver's

carrying the laundry basket. Vin’s putting on a lab
coat, carrying an old-school, leather doctor's bag.

OLIVER
This is like a mansion.
VINCENT
When we get in there, don’t talk.
OLIVER
Where are we going?
VINCENT
How about you practice not talking

now.

Vin turns a corner.

PATIENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A WOMAN lies in a bed, watching TV. This is Vin’s wife.
SANDY. She has advanced Alzheimer's. Vin and Oliver
enter.

SANDY
There you are, doctor.

VINCENT
Good to see you, Sandy.
42.

Vin puts his doctor’s bag on the foot of her bed, digs in
it.

VINCENT (CONT’D)
How're we feeling?

SANDY
Today's my birthday.

It’s not. Vin pulls out an old stethoscope.

VINCENT
Okay. Well, happy birthday.
(to Oliver)
Put that stuff in the drawers over

there.
Oliver complies.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
Let’s see what the old ticker
sounds like.
Vin moves bedside, puts the stethoscope to Sandy’s chest.
SANDY
Can you tell them I don’t like the
green beans, when they put the
bacon bits chopped up in there with
them. It’s too greasy for me.

Vin moves some hair off Sandy’s face. Lightly touches
her cheek.

VINCENT
You bet, Sandy.
EXT. SUNNYSIDE GROUNDS - LATER
“Doctor” Vin and Oliver are sitting on a bench next to
Sandy (in a wheelchair,) in front of a gorgeous pond,

cluttered with ducks.

SANDY
They say I’m going home next week.

They don’t.

VINCENT
That’s the plan.

It’s not.

SANDY
Is that your grandson?

VINCENT
Nope.
43.

Sandy looks Oliver over.

SANDY
Is he a doctor?

VINCENT
Sure.

SANDY

What’s his specialty?
Vin looks him over too.

VINCENT
I don’t know.

NURSE'S STATION - LATER
Vin’s talking with Sandy’s nurse, ANA, a kind-eyed
Filipino lady in her forties. She hands him a bundle of
dirty laundry.
ANA

You know, we can do the laundry

here, Mr. Vincent. We have the

service.

VINCENT
Gives me something to do.

Vin hands the laundry off to Oliver.

ANA
Who’s your helper?

VINCENT
He’s twelve bucks an hour.

OLIVER
It’s Oliver actually.

ANA
Nice to meet you, Oliver. I’m Ana.

Vin heads off. Stops.

VINCENT
She doesn’t like the green beans.

ANA
I’1l make a note, Mr. Vincent.

Ana writes in a pad.
VINCENT
She always liked broccoli.
Broccoli's good.

Vin walks off. Oliver catches up.
44,

INT. VINCENT’S GARAGE - LATER

Oliver’s standing in a fight stance across from Vin,
who’s wearing a bandana, holding a Maker’s Mark in one
hand while leaning against a hanging heavy bag.

Oliver punches the bag. It’s like a butterfly kiss.

VINCENT
That's just going to get you beat
up real bad.

OLIVER

I don’t want to fight anyway.

VINCENT
No one wants to fight, kid. You
think I wanted to go to war? You
think an eighteen year old wants to
sit in a rice paddy while bullets
are screaming past his ears on both

sides?

OLIVER
When was that?

VINCENT
Vietnam.

OLIVER

You were there?

VINCENT
No, I’m imagining it.

Vincent steps back, thinks.

VINCENT (CONT’D)
All right. I’11 teach you one
thing, it’s probably the only hope
you got. If you do it right,
you'll break his nose with one
shot.

Oliver is rattled.

OLIVER
Break his nose.

VINCENT
Relax, you won’t do it right.
EXT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

Maggie’s walking to her car after work. She’s exhausted.
Just as she puts her key in the door...a MAN walks up.

MAN
Maggie?
45.

She turns, clutches her purse.

MAGGIE
I have mace.

MAN
I have papers.

The man holds up an envelope. Moves closer.

MAN (CONT'D)
LA County Family court.

He hands the papers to Maggie. She hates taking them.

MAN (CONT'D)
As they say, “You've been served.”

He turns off, stops.
MAN (CONT'D)
I didn’t mean to scare you. Just a
job.

Maggie nods, leans against the car.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

It's late. Maggie knocks on Vin’s door.

INT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER
Vin’s leading Maggie into the den.

VINCENT
I’m working up an estimate on the
fence. And we’re looking at three
hundred on the tree. Not gonna
negotiate with myself.

MAGGIE
I get paid at end of next week.

VINCENT
That’s nice for you. Working for a
living. Rough out there.

In the den, we find Oliver asleep on the couch. Felix
the Cat is curled up on top of him.

MAGGIE
I’ll pay you of course for the
extra time.

VINCENT
I wasn’t offering a rebate.
46.

Maggie scoops up a sleeping Oliver.

VINCENT (CONT’D)
What you been crying about?

It's very obvious that Maggie’s been bawling.

MAGGIE
It’s a long story.

VINCENT
‘Kay. What’s the punchline?

MAGGIE
Oliver's father wants custody.

Vin thinks.

VINCENT
There goes my job security.

Maggie smiles.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
That could've gone either way.
EXT. THE PINK CADILLAC - STRIP CLUB - THE NEXT DAY

Classic dumpy titty-bar in a rundown industrial strip.
Vin’s sitting in his car in the parking lot. Waiting.

Daka eventually comes rolling out a side door. Spots
Vin. Walks his way.

INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Daka hops in, pissed.

VINCENT
Who pissed in your Cheerios?

DAKA
I can dance no more.

VINCENT
That a surprise?

DAKA
Fuck you, Vin. I need this money.

VINCENT
The self-employed racket is a tough
road, I’'ll say that.
47.

DAKA
I should sue these. It’s...the
word...discrimination. Against the
pregnant woman. Yes?

VINCENT
I think you have case.
DAKA
(rubs belly)
This bump costing me much money.
VINCENT
Nowhere near what he’s gonna cost
ya.
DAKA
It’s not a “he.”
VINCENT
It’s a she?
DAKA
I do not wish for boy. Boys are
fucks.
VINCENT

You don’t know?

DAKA
What do I know?

VINCENT
The sex of the baby?

DAKA
How do I know this, Vin? I look
like the psychic to you?

VINCENT
They have technologies-—

DAKA
I know what they have. Maybe I ask
“employer” to fax insurance card to
pay ultrasound. Yes?

Vin gets it.

INT. OBGYN’S EXAMINING ROOM - LATER

Daka has her legs up in stirrups, as an ULTRASOUND TECH
squirts gel on her belly in preparation for an
ultrasound.

DAKA
This is cold.
48.

ULTRASOUND TECH
Sorry. Forgot to tell you that.
It’s cold. But just for a minute.

The Tech places the wand on Daka’s belly.

ULTRASOUND TECH (CONT’D)
I’m gonna move this around here and
take some pictures of the baby.

DAKA
For taking pictures?

ULTRASOUND TECH
Well. Sort of. More like images.
(motions to the monitor)

Daka looks at the monitor.
ULTRASOUND TECH (CONT’D)
It’s pretty cool. See...there...
Right...there. That’s the head.

DAKA
This is very big head. Maybe good.

ULTRASOUND TECH
Biggest part at this age.

Adjusts the wand.

ULTRASOUND TECH (CONT’D)
And these are her little legs.

DAKA
She? You see this?

ULTRASOUND TECH
Oh, it’s a girl. You didn’t know?
I'm sorry, did you not want to
know?

Daka could cry. But she won’t, she’s far too tough.
DAKA
No. It’s good to know.
INT. OBGYN’S LOBBY - LATER

Vin and Daka are checking out with a MEDICAL
RECEPTIONIST. Vin is digging through his wallet.

VINCENT
What’s my deductible running?

MEDICAL RECEPTIONIST
I couldn't verify her with your
insurance, Mr. Canatella.
49.

Daka butts in.

DAKA
We are just married.

VINCENT
That happened.

MEDICAL RECEPTIONIST
Really?

VINCENT
Yep. Told my insurance. You know
how slow they are. Paperwork.
Bureaucracy. State of the medical
profession in general.

DAKA
Don’t let him started.

The Receptionist doesn't believe a word of this.

VINCENT
What’s that deductible run?

MEDICAL RECEPTIONIST
Twenty dollars.

Daka puts her head on Vin’s shoulder. Plays the part.

DAKA
Thank you, sugar plum.

Vin forks over a twenty.
VINCENT
(under his breath)
You owe me, lady.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM —- CONTINUOUS

Dodge ball in progress. TWO TEAMS OF BOYS compete,
throwing the ball as hard as they can at each other.

Coach Mitchell’s on the opposite side of the gym, working
on basketball drills with the GIRLS.

Ozinski and Brooklyn are mowing down their OPPONENTS one
after another, until only Oliver remains. He’s hard to
hit, he’s so tiny.

Ozinski has the ball.

OZINSKI
Get ready for a red ass, shit bag.

He runs. Throws. Oliver jumps. The ball bounces under
him and hits the wall, heading back towards Ozinski.
50.

Oliver runs for the ball, as fast as his fawn legs will
take him. It’s like slow motion.

At the half line...the ball is feet away from crossing
back onto Ozinski’s side. Oliver dives for it.

Thud. He lands hard on the gym floor, his face smacks
the half line.

Ozinski grabs the ball. Smiles. Runs toward Oliver.

OZINSKI (CONT’D)
Say your prayers, you little pussy.

Ozinski winds up. Oliver stands, trying to get the hell
out of there.

Ozinski’s a few feet away. He hurls the ball at Oliver's
mug...

Thwwapppppp. Right on the kisser. This is bad.
Oliver’s glasses fly off his head. He crashes to the
floor in a heap. Both hands over his face.

Silence. You could hear a pin drop. KIDS gather around
Oliver, concerned, curious, scared. He’s not moving.

Even Ozinski looks worried. He walks over, closer to
Oliver.

A whistle blows. Coach Mitchell runs across the gym
towards the scene. He gets there, just as Oliver lifts
his head, uncovers his face. Blood everywhere.

Coach Mitchell pushes through the crowd. Ozinski backs
up. Out of nowhere, Oliver screams, a guttural kind of
attack call.

OLIVER
You mother fucking, ass-face, dick
bag...

He has the wildest, animalistic look in his eyes. And
he’s running directly at Ozinski.

The entire class is frozen in disbelief...what the hell
is he doing?

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Asshole, cock sucking, son-of-a-
whore...

With his hand in a sort of death grip-blow, he hits
Ozinski square in the nose...driving his schnoz up into
his brain.

Splickkkk! Ozinski’s nose explodes with blood. He falls
flat backwards, passing out along the way.

Thud. Ozinski smacks down on the gym floor. Game over.
51.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

Oliver runs up to the house, bangs on the front door.

Waits. Bangs again. Waits.

Finally, Daka opens the door, wearing one of Vin’s old

robes.
DAKA
What is for you?
OLIVER
Who are you?
DAKA
I am Daka. You are who?
OLIVER
I’m Oliver.
DAKA

Why you bang door so much?

OLIVER
He’s hard of hearing.

Vin screams from within.

VINCENT
Let him in.

DAKA
Don’t yell at me!?

Daka opens the door wide for Oliver.
DAKA (CONT'D)

Fuck face is yeller.

INT. VIN’S HOUSE - THE DEN - LATER

Vin and Daka are sitting on the couch. Oliver’s standing
in front of them, his eyeglasses are patched together

with tape.

VINCENT
(a tinge of pride)
You broke his nose.

OLIVER
Yes, sir. I think so. There was
blood everywhere. You should have
seen it.

VINCENT
You must have hit it just right.
Let me see.
52.

Oliver demonstrates: the hand position, the stance.

DAKA
You teach him fighting?

VINCENT
He’s a runt. Needs to learn how to
defend himself.

Daka stands, had enough.

DAKA
Where’s this money?

VINCENT
It’s on the dresser.

DAKA
Any extras?

VINCENT
It’s all there. Minus the
deductible.

Daka walks off.
DAKA

You don’t teach the children. Look
at you.

She’s gone.

OLIVER
Who is she?

VINCENT
A lady of the night.

OLIVER
What’s that?

Vin lights a cigarette.

VINCENT
One of the more honest ways to make
a living.

INT. YONKERS RACE TRACK - DAY - LATER
Vin and Oliver are staring up at the betting board.
VINCENT
The board tells you what the day’s
action looks like. Race number.

Who’s running, riding, so forth.

OLIVER
What’s 20 slash 1?
53.

VINCENT
Odds. Some bookie outta Vegas
thinks that horse has a one in
twenty chance of winning.

OLIVER
And what do you get if he does?

VINCENT
Twenty times your money.

OLIVER
That’s a good deal.

VINCENT
If you win. Sure.

THE ENCLOSURE - LATER

Vin and Oliver stand at the fence, watching HORSES and
JOCKEYS walk.

Beat.

VINCENT
(re: a horse)
That one there with the wraps...is

The kid is fast.

a dog.
OLIVER
Doesn't sound like a compliment.
VINCENT
The odds of him winning are
astronomical.
OLIVER
We should take him across the
board.
VINCENT

Don’t get ahead of yourself.

TRACKSIDE - LATER

Vin’s in his “booth.” Eyes closed, holding his racing
form to his temple. Oliver’s studying his own race form.
OLIVER
What’s a-
VINCENT

You see what I’m doing here?

OLIVER
Praying?
54.

VINCENT
Praying?

OLIVER
That’s what it looks like.

VINCENT
I thought we talked about talking.

Vin opens his eyes. Annoyed. Oliver could care.

OLIVER
What’s a trifecta?

VINCENT
You pick three horses to finish 1-2-
3, in the order they come in. High
risk, high reward.

OLIVER
Sounds improbable.

VINCENT
If you’re gonna gamble, you might
as well have the chance to win big.

Oliver scans the form, thinks.
OLIVER
Wishful Thinking. Sweeter Lady.
Champagne Flute. One, two, three.
800 to l.

VINCENT
How much money you got?

Oliver un-Velcros his wallet.

OLIVER
Seven dollars.
VINCENT
Lunch money?
OLIVER
Yes, sir.
VINCENT
You might as well learn the hard
way.

Vin pulls some cash from his wallet. Stands.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
I'll go in with you. That’s called
mitigation.

They're off to the betting window.
55.

THE FINISH LINE - LATER

The HORSES fly across. One. Two. Three. We whip over
to Vin and Oliver standing at the rail, screaming like
school kids. They hit it! The trifecta. For the first
time we see Vin’s smile. It’s the kind of smile that
lights up a life.

As Oliver jumps up and down...Vin catches Zucko in the
stands. He crumples his race form and starts to throw
his usual “just lost” tantrum. It’s a good act.
Oliver’s confused.

OLIVER
We won? Didn’t we win?

VINCENT
Roll with it, kid.

Without missing a beat, Oliver throws his hands in the
air. Tosses his race form.

OLIVER
Son-of-a-bitch.

Damn good.

VINCENT
Son-of-a-bitch.

Vin kicks his chair, walks off. Oliver follows.

OLIVER
Mother fuckers.

Zucko shakes his head at the losers.
VINCENT
(under )

Ease up there.
EXT. RACETRACK - PARKING LOT
Vin’s practically running. Ducking in, out, around and
between cars, a plastic shopping bag in his hand.
Oliver’s on his tail.
INT. VIN’S CAR - LATER
A wad of cash sits between the two. $5,600 to be exact.

VINCENT
Your mom can’t know about this.

OLIVER
Exactly.

Oliver nods.
56.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
She could really use it though.

VINCENT
Not if she knows where it came
from.

OLIVER

You keep my half for me?

Vin knows that’s not smart.

VINCENT
Well. I don’t want. Let’s not go
there.

OLIVER

What am I going to do with it?

INT. THE BANK — CONTINUOUS

Vin and Oliver sit at the banker’s desk, waiting. Terry
strolls up.

TERRY
Good afternoon.

He recognizes Vincent.

TERRY (CONT'D)
Mr. Canatella.

VINCENT
Kind of you to remember. Need to
open up a savings account for my
grandson here.

Terry has a seat. Vin slides a stack of cash across the
desk.

TERRY
Never too young to start banking.

Vin slides over a few more bills

VINCENT
And this'll get my account back to
zero. Close me out, while you’re
tapping away there.

Vin smiles a fuck you at him.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
(to Oliver)

Don’t grow up to be a pencil

pusher, kiddo. They’re spineless.
57.

INT. THE BUCK - NIGHT - LATER

Vin is dancing solo to Steely Dan's, “Do It Again.” He’s
wasted. Maker’s in one hand, a smoke in the other.

His dance is a bizarre mix of slow-motion Tai Chi moves
and yoga poses. In it we see the punch he taught Oliver.

From the bar, Oliver watches. Perplexed.

BAR - LATER

Celebration dinner. Vin and Oliver are bellied up to the
bar, eating a feast of bar food. Burgers, fries,
mozzarella sticks, onion rings, Coke, a few Maker's
Marks.

Oliver slurps his drink to the bottom.

VINCENT
You want another?

OLIVER
Yes, please.

VINCENT

Go for it. We’re living today.
Oliver calls out weakly to the bartender (Roger.)

OLIVER
Excuse me, sir.

VINCENT
You kids. Damn small talkers. No
point in yapping if nobody's
listening. Let’s hear it.

Oliver belts out.

OLIVER
Excuse me, sir.

VINCENT
Can't get nothing in this life
without being heard.
Roger walks over.

OLIVER
Another Coke, please.

VINCENT
You can hit me while you’re at it

Roger knows Vin is wasted.

ROGER
I’m all out Maker's, Vin. You

at the bar.

VINCENT
We're going to find another place
to our spend money.

OLIVER
He’s just doing his job, Vin.

Vin stares at Oliver.

VINCENT
Turncoats. Everywhere you look.
No loyalty anymore. Everyone
taking care of themselves in the
old U.S. of A. That’s why we’re
falling apart.

Vin drains his wet ice, then smashes his glass on the
bar. It shatters. His hand is ripped open.

ROGER
Damnit, Vin.
VINCENT
Just a cut, pal. I’ve had a lot of

them.

Vin gets woozy, leans into Oliver.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Let’s get you home, kiddo. Got
homework to do.

He passes out.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

A taxi pulls into the driveway. The headlights
illuminate a very pissed off Maggie, standing on Vin’s

lawn.

Vin and Oliver climb out of the car. Vin’s hand is

bandaged.
59.

OLIVER
Hi, mom.

MAGGIE
(to Vin)
Where the hell’s your car?

OLIVER
It broke down.

VINCENT
It broke down.

MAGGIE
Really. I don’t appreciate you
taking him anywhere without asking
me.

VINCENT
This is gonna be fun.

MAGGIE
Don’t be a smart ass for once. I
need to know where my son is at all
times, okay?

Oliver slumps off.

Oliver goes inside.

OLIVER
We went to eat.

VINCENT
He should starve?

MAGGIE
Get inside Oliver.

OLIVER
Mom-

MAGGIE
Go on.

OLIVER
Good night, Vin.

VINCENT
We'll see.

MAGGIE

He’s fighting at school. You know
about this?

VINCENT
Mentioned something like that.
60.

MAGGIE
Great. He tells you. Not his
mother.

VINCENT

If you haven’t noticed...you’re not
home much. Kinda hard to have a
conversation with someone who’s not
there.

MAGGIE
I love it when people like you give
people like me advice. Especially
parenting advice.

VINCENT
I didn’t sign on for hormones here,
deary. That’1ll cost you 15 bucks
an hour.

MAGGIE
You don’t have kids. You don’t
have anything to think about but
yourself.

Vin starts to walk away.

VINCENT
What do you know about me? Really?
Tell me. I’d love it.

Vin stops. Maggie thinks.

MAGGIE
Okay. You're right. I don’t know
a whole lot about you. Because you
don’t want much known. So you act
like a prick and everyone stays
away.

VINCENT
If it ain’t broken...

MAGGIE
It is broken. Look at it.

Vin goes into his house. Gets the last word in before he
closes the door.

VINCENT
I’m up to 40 hours this week. 41
starts time-and-a-half.

He’s gone.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

Oliver’s sitting on a bench outside the Principal's
office.
61.

Across from him, Ozinski’s sitting with his MOTHER

(REESA.) Ozinski’s nose is bandaged like a prize
fighter’s.
REESA
(to Oliver)
You're a real tiny fella, aren’t
ya.
OLIVER

Yes, ma'am.

REESA
You take Judo or something.

Ozinski is embarrassed.

OZINSKI
Ma.

REESA
Shut your face. You don’t talk for
a month.

Ozinski slumps.

REESA (CONT'D)
I'm glad it was a little shit that
knocked the snot outta-ya. Now ya
got no excuses.

INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Maggie’s sitting across from PRINCIPAL O'BRIEN, a puffy-
faced official looking gent in his fifties. Maggie’s
reading a report.

MAGGIE
I can’t even say these words.

PRINCIPAL O'BRIEN
They’re...creative.

MAGGIE
That’s one way to put it.

PRINCIPAL O’BRIEN
Adjusting to a new school is tough
on children at this age. At any
age. So, I don’t want to minimize
that...but is there anything else
going on that we should be aware
of?

MAGGIE
I don’t even know where to start.

PRINCIPAL O'BRIEN
How about his father?
62.

MAGGIE
Oh. Well. Please. That’1l take
up your whole day. We’re in the
middle of a divorce. Oliver's
father...was sleeping with his
assistant. And our accountant.
And her assistant. And my
hairdresser. While she was still
cutting my hair. That was fun.
Now he’s filed for custody of
Oliver. Full custody. And he
won't pay support till he gets his
way. You see. Plus he’s a lawyer,
so. So. I just took Oliver away
as fast as I could and took this
job at Mission Hills. I’m a CAT
scan tech, so I see a lot of rough
situations. Tumors. Cancer.
Cysts. Clots. All that. And of
course, I know what I see and I
can’t say anything to people. Which
is miserable, as you can imagine.
And I work really late, trying to
get our act together. Give Oliver
a better education and a semi-
normal life. And fight David and
this custody shit. Excuse me.
That’s his name. David. My ex.
He never wanted kids anyway. He
just doesn’t want me to be happy.
Oliver's adopted. Do you know
that? How would you. I’m not able
to have kids. Something about my
Fallopian tubes being twisted. I
think they were just recoiling from
David's sperm.

Maggie reaches for a tissue.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Do you mind?

Principal O’Brien shakes his head “no.” He has no words.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
I’m sure all of this has permeated
into Oliver’s little being. And as
they do in these situations...he’s
acting out. Right?

Principal O’Brien smiles. Maggie blows her nose.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - BATHROOM - LATER

Detention. Two adjacent bathroom stalls. Oliver’s in
one, Ozinski in the other. They’re scrubbing the
shitters, floors, walls, et al with scouring pads,
toothbrushes.

Quiet. Finally Ozinski breaks the silence.
63.

OZINSKI
My real name’s Robert. Ozinski is
my last name. People call me
Ozinski cause Crespi called me that
last year. Now everyone calls me
that.

Oliver stops scrubbing.

OZINSKI (CONT’D)
I don’t really like it. Ozinski.
Just too many kids call me that
now, so it’s not like I can go
‘round all day and tell ‘em, “Dick
wad, don’t call me Ozinski, my
name’s Robert.” Cause I would
spend my whole life doin’ that.

Oliver stands, takes a piss.

Then.

OZINSKI (CONT’D)
You takin a wiz?

OLIVER
Sorry, can’t hold it.

OZINSKI
Robert was my dad’s name. So, I’m
a junior. He’s not around though.
I don’t really know him, cause he
left when I was a baby.

OLIVER
My dad’s not around either. He did
some bad things to my mom and so we
left and I haven’t seen him ina
while.

OZINSKI
No shit.

Oliver flushes. Ozinski shuffles around. Then, Oliver's
cell phone slides under the stall, followed by his house

keys.

OZINSKI (CONT’D)
Your dad the one that taught ya how
ta fight?

Oliver takes his stuff.

OLIVER
No. My baby sitter.
64.

INT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - DAY - LATER

Tacky office. Vin’s sitting across from the rehab
director, SHIRLEY JORSTIN, a tight-lipped, tough egg in
her 50s.

SHIRLEY
There’s plenty of affordable health
care options, Mr. Canatella.
Sunnyside’s pricey. It’s not for
everyone.

VINCENT
My Sandy, she’s gotta have the
best. So, I’1ll just figure this
thing out.

She hands him a folder: invoices, bills, statements.

SHIRLEY
You’re months behind. We’re not in
the credit business, as you know.

VINCENT
I get that.

Vin looks inside, just a glance is enough to know he’s
fucked.

SHIRLEY
So...

VINCENT
So, what’s that mean?

SHIRLEY
We need payment in full and three
months in advance.

VINCENT
Got it.

SHIRLEY
By tomorrow.

VINCENT
Tomorrow.

SHIRLEY

We'll transfer her wherever you
decide to put her.

VINCENT
Put her. That’s it. Or we get the
boot?

SHIRLEY

That’s not the best way to phrase
what’s happening.
65.

Vin stands, pissed.

VINCENT
What is the best way to phrase it?

SHIRLEY
It is what it is.

Vin takes a deep breath. Exhales slowly.

EXT. SUNNYSIDE GROUNDS - LATER

Vin’s pushing Sandy around the pond. He’s wearing his
doctor’s getup.

SANDY
I can’t wait for autumn. They
plant the most beautiful mums all
around the water.

VINCENT
Yep.

Vin parks in front of their bench.
SANDY
Every color you can imagine. I
don’t know where they get them all.

VINCENT
At the garden store.

Sandy laughs. Touches his hand.

SANDY
You've always been so funny, Vin.

Vin...she said Vin.

VINCENT
Sandy.

A beat. Sandy looks confused.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
It’s me, babe. Vin.

And just like that, she’s gone.
SANDY
The ducks eat them though. We have
to shoo them away. It’s sucha
shame.

Vin could die. It’s just too much.
66.
INT. NURSE'S STATION - MOMENTS LATER
Vin gets the dirty laundry bag from Ana. The ritual.

VINCENT
It’s a lot lighter.

ANA
She didn’t change much this week.

VINCENT
Easier on my back.

Vin reaches into his pocket, pulls out some cash. A few
wrinkled bills. He hands them to Ana.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
You think we can get some plants or
something for the room.

ANA
Sure. I can have the concierge
order something.

VINCENT
Mums. Or the like. I’m not a
florist.

He gets a few more bucks.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Here. For the trouble.

ANA
No. No, sir, Mr. Vincent. This is
my job. I take care of people.
Please.

VINCENT
You go way beyond doing your job,
Ana. You been an angel for my
Sandy.

He puts the money in her smock pocket. Ana’s practically
blushing.

ANA
Okay, Mr. Vincent. We don’t make
habit now. Okay?

VINCENT
Deal. I’m shit broke anyway.

She laughs on her way out.

ANA
I go tell the concierge.

VINCENT
Thanks, doll.
67.

Ana disappears behind the station.

Vin looks at the cabinet on the wall behind the counter:
full of meds. He looks around.

EXT. SHITTY NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

The neighborhood is lined with decrepid houses, iron
gates shielding every window and door. Vin sits in his
car outside one of the more indigent shacks. Sunglasses
and a hat conceal his mug.

After too long...Daka comes waddling out of the house
with a paper bag. Leans into the window.

DAKA
Hundred dollars.

VINCENT
Hundred bucks? I pay more than
that for one prescription.

Daka pulls bottles of meds out of the bag. Names them.

DAKA
For the epilepsy. Prostate
flaring. To soften the shitting.

VINCENT
That should have some value.

DAKA
And to piss stronger.

VINCENT
Five hundred bucks. That stuff is
high dollar.

DAKA
He say one hundred, take or leave
it. You can’t sell this to get
high. You must to find some freak
or old fuck.

Vin just stares at her.
VINCENT
I’1l take the hundred.
INT. TELLER WINDOW NUMBER 23 - LATER
Vin’s at the bank, standing at TELLER WIDOW #23 again.
TELLER #23

You're account’s closed, Mr.
Canatella.
68.

VINCENT
I know that. Withdraw from my
grandson’s account there. I should
be on it.

Vin hands her his ID. She doesn’t think anything about
it.

TELLER #23
How much, sir?

VINCENT
What’s the balance?
THE TRACK BREEZEWAY - CONTINUOUS
Vin’s standing below the board, holding his race form to
his temple. Communicating with the racing gods.
INT. RACETRACK - CONTINUOUS
Vin slides a wad of cash through the window. Huge bet.
VINCENT
Lucky Lincoln. New Dime and
Sammy’s Savior. One, two, three in
the third.
The ATTENDANT takes the cash.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
That’s going to make me all better,

my friend.

Vin collects the ticket. Rubs it for good luck.

INT. RACETRACK - BAR
Vin’s watching the race on the bar TV.

The race trumpet blows. The HORSES writhe in their
stalls. The buzzer sounds. The gates fly open.
And...they’re off.

Vin can’t watch, he closes his eyes. Takes a long drink
of his Maker’s. Puffs his cigarette. Listens.

The ANNOUNCER calls the race.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And that’s New Dime taking the
early lead on the rails, followed
by Pretty Patty and Lucky Lincoln.

The Announcer keeps barking in the background. Vin never
opens his eyes.
69.

EXT. RACETRACK - LATER

Vin’s walking towards his car. He lost. It’s in his
gait.

INT. THE BUCK - LATER

Vin’s slumped, ruined in his mind. Head down. Cigarette
dangling from his lips. Gus and Linda are sitting on
their regular stools, playing Kino.

GUS
Vin give me a number?

VINCENT
Five grand.

GUS
A Kino number.

VINCENT
You got five grand I can borrow,
Gus? I’1l1 probably die before I
pay you back even.

GUS
You serious?

VINCENT
Dead serious.

GUS

If I had five grand, I wouldn’t be
sitting here. Let me tell ya.
We'd be on that Carnival Cruise
ship somewhere.

LINDA
The Alaskan one, Gus. They say
that one’s the prettiest.

GUS
Whatever one. Eating the buffet.
They say those buffets are like
something else. Endless crab and
lobster and salad bar.

LINDA
The drinks are gratis too.
Champagne in the morning with
orange juice. They gotta name for
it...

VINCENT
Mimosa.

LINDA
That’s it.
70.

Vin stands, lays some money on the bar.
VINCENT
(calls out to Roger)
Rog. Get these two some Mimosas on
me.
LINDA
(surprised in the least)
Oh. That’s sweet of ya, Vin.
Vin walks off.
VINCENT
I hope you two get to that cruise
one day.
He leaves. Gus and Linda are in shock.
LINDA
That was real nice a him.

EXT. CITY STREET - LATER

Vin’s car labors through traffic. Endless traffic.

EXT. VIN’S DRIVEWAY - LATER

He pulls into his driveway. Parks.

INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Vin sits there. Looking at his house. His life. What
now?

INT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Vin walks in. Shuts the door behind him. Turns when he
hears...

ZUCKO
You must think I’m not a very
serious person, Vinny.

How the hell did he get here?

VINCENT
You broke into my house?

ZUCKO
The back door was “ajar.”

VINCENT
You have no right to be here. How
the hell do you know where I live?
71.

ZUCKO
I do homework on assholes that owe
money.

Another THUG walks into the room from the bedroom. This
is ANTWAN. Big, dirty. He’s carrying an antique jewelry
box.

VINCENT
That's my wife’s, you son-of-a-
bitch.

Vin makes a move for the kitchen.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
I’m calling the police.

Zucko stands, pulls out a gun.

ZUCKO
You think that’s realistic? We’re
just gonna sit here and let you
pick up a phone and dial 911. Are
you that old? Or that stupid?

Vin turns to Antwan, yanks the jewelry box out of his
hands.

VINCENT
Get the hell away from that.

Antwan pushes Vin. He flies across the room. Hits the
fireplace wall. Jewelry everywhere.

ZUCKO
You always have to take the hard
way, Vin. Why is that?

VINCENT
It’s more interesting.

Vin rolls up his sleeves. Preparing to fight.
ZUCKO
It’s more painful. Even I know
that.
Vin takes a step towards Antwan.

VINCENT
Let’s do it then.

ANTWAN
This mother fucker’s crazy.

ZUCKO
Don’t kill him. But do get close.

Vin takes another step. Stops. Something’s wrong. He’s
wobbly. He grabs his head. Shakes it.
72.

ZUCKO (CONT'D)
What are you doing, old man?

Vin is blurry eyed. He drops to his knees. Hard. His
eyes roll back in his head. It looks like a seizure.

ANTWAN
He’s dying, man.

Vin falls face first onto the floor. Thud.
BLACK OUT.

ZUCKO (V.0.)
(in the darkness)
Don’t touch him. Leave that shit.

EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - SIDEWALKS
Oliver's walking out of the school with Ozinski.

OZINSKI
I have a cousin that’s Jewish. He
had a big shit party when he turned
13.

OLIVER
A barmitzah.

OZINSKI
Yeah. That’s it. Biggest party I
ever seen.

OLIVER
It’s a coming-of-age ceremony.
Supposedly a boy becomes a man at
that age.

Ozinski thinks long and hard. It hurts.
OZINSKI
Nah. My cousin ain’t no man. He’s
a little pussy. His wiener ain't
even shaved.

OLIVER
Circumcised.

They stop at Ozinski’s bike, chained to a rack.
OZINSKI
You know a lotta fancy words.
You’re like an Einstein.
Oliver smiles.

OLIVER
I read a lot.
73.

OZINSKI
That’s cool. See ya tomorrow.

OLIVER
Yep. Bye, Robert.

Ozinski nods. Oliver walks away. Then...
OZINSKI
Hey, how come ya don’t have a bike?
EXT. CITY STREET - LATER
Oliver’s riding on the back of Ozinski'’s bike. Scared
for his life, but loving every minute of it.
EXT. RESEDENTIAL STREET - LATER

Ozinski and Oliver arrive in front of Vin’s house.
Oliver jumps off the bike.

OZINSKI
Ya think I could meet the old
bastard?

OLIVER

Sure. Just know he’s not real
friendly at first. It takes hima
long time to warm up.

Ozinski parks his bike.

INT. VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Oliver keys in. Ozinski right on his tail. Something's
not right, the house, the energy.

FELIX THE CAT
Meow. Meow.

Felix rushes up to Oliver, hides behind his legs.
Oliver walks into the room...and sees...Vin. Sprawled
out on the floor, face first. Still.

INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - LATER

CAT Scan lab. Maggie and ANOTHER NURSE are strapping Vin
in. His eyes are open, but no one’s home.

MAGGIE
Hi, Vincent. It’s me Maggie.
Oliver’s mom.

He looks blankly at her.
74.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
We're going to put you in this
machine here and run some tests,
okay? It won’t hurt a bit.

ANOTHER NURSE
He can’t understand you, Maggie.

Maggie nods. Upset. Vincent grabs her hand. Holds it.
He understands.

MAGGIE
There you are. This takes about
thirty minutes, okay?

Vin says, “I understand” with his eyes.

THE WAITING ROOM - LATER

Oliver’s sitting in the waiting area. Amongst STRANGERS.
Maggie walks in, worried, looking for her son. Finally
she sees him...

OLIVER
He okay, ma?

She puts her arms around him.

MAGGIE
You’re such a brave little man.
OLIVER
We thought he was dead.
MAGGIE
Who’s we?
OLIVER
Robert Ozinski and I.
MAGGIE
The bully kid?
OLIVER
We're friends. Since I broke his
nose.
MAGGIE
I don’t even know what you’re doing
anymore.

Maggie starts to get teary, she rubs Oliver’s head.

OLIVER
Mother. Stop feeling sorry for me.
And yourself. We're doing good.
You're working hard, every day and
we need the money. It’s okay.
75.

Holy shit. Maggie is speechless, he’s a grown-up all of
a sudden.

MAGGIE
I think he’s had a stroke. You
know what that is?

OLIVER
I've seen some billboards. “Know
the signs of a stroke and call 911
immediately.” But they never say
what the signs are so...

MAGGIE
It’s a blockage in a brain artery.

Oliver knows this is serious.

OLIVER
That’s not good.

Maggie puts her arm around him.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - DAY

Crespi’s class. Oliver’s standing in front of the
darkened classroom, presenting, using the Smart Board.

OLIVER
I chose Saint William of Rochester,
the patron saint of adopted
children.

Oliver clicks the Smart Board and a picture of Saint
William pops up on the screen.

OLIVER (CONT'D)

As a young man, William led a “wild
and misspent youth.” Which
included gambling, womanizing,
drinking and other things
considered inappropriate-—

Brother Crespi interrupts (from the back of the room.)

BROTHER CRESPI
Why did you chose Saint William?

Throughout, Oliver clicks through slides on the Smart
Board.

OLIVER
Well, he found a baby on the church
steps and took it in and raised it
as his own. He named him David.

Click.
76.

OLIVER (CONT'D)

And then years later he went ona
pilgrimage to the Holy Land with
his son. And David went,
like...crazy, and clubbed Saint
William and cut his throat and then
robbed the body.

The slides are stock footage pictures of a crime scene.

Blood.

Mayhem.

BROTHER CRESPI
Ouch. Okay. Didn’t see that
coming.

OLIVER
It’s a pretty interesting story.
Which is why I chose it. The other
saints I looked at were all so...
“saintly” I guess.

BROTHER CRESPI
What does “saintly” mean to you?

OLIVER
I don’t know. I don’t really
believe in saints and all that
stuff. I mean, it seems like St.
William gets to be a saint just
because he was killed by the boy he
adopted. These days people get
killed all the time. They don’t
get to be saint for it.

BROTHER CRESPI
So you don’t think we have saints
living amongst us?

OLIVER
I don’t know any.

BROTHER CRESPI
Thank you, Oliver.

Oliver walks to his seat. Brother Crespi moves to the
front of the class.

BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
Despite young Oliver’s reticence.
I believe there are saints all
around us today. They might never
be recognized as such by a
religion, but they’re every bit as
important to our society as the
saints in the textbook.

He flips on the Smart Board: “Modern Day Saints” is the

heading.
77.

BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
Thus, you're going to research
someone you know, or know of, and
determine if they have the
qualities of a saint. Hence the
catchy title: Modern Day Saints.

Hands go up, lots of questions.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

Oliver’s walking home from school. He sees SOMEONE
sitting on Vin’s steps. It’s Daka.

DAKA
Where’s is he? The car is there.

OLIVER
He’s in the hospital.

DAKA
Why for?

Oliver just stares at her.

INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - LATER

Maggie, Oliver and Daka are walking down a hallway of
PATIENT rooms.

MAGGIE
How do you and Vincent know each
other?
DAKA
I work for this man.
MAGGIE
Doing what?
DAKA

Working for him.

Maggie looks at Oliver. He’s buttoned up.

INT. VIN’S HOSPITAL ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER

Vin’s lying in bed, wide-eyed. He looks pissed. A
SPEECH THERAPIST is trying to “therapize” Vin.

The stroke has caused Aphasia and language apraxia. It’s
a_struggle for Vin to talk, and hard to understand.

The Speech Therapist holds up a flash card with the word
“Dog” printed on it.
78.

SPEECH THERAPIST
Try to sound it out.

Vin pretends to think, then holds up his middle finger.

SPEECH THERAPIST (CONT'D)
Not quite.

Vin holds up the other middle finger. Double bird.
SPEECH THERAPIST (CONT'D)
You didn’t lose your sense of
humor.

Maggie, Oliver and Daka walk in.

MAGGIE
You have some company, Vin.

DAKA
I say hello only. The hospital is
shit place.
Oliver walks to Vin's bedside.

OLIVER
You look a lot better.

VINCENT
(slurred, re: Therapist)
Getttt this dippppshitt outta here.
Oliver’s confused with Vin’s slurred speech.

OLIVER
Wha’dya say?

VINCENT
Getttt this...dipppppp...

Vin gets frustrated, his mouth won’t work. He swipes
hospital effects off the bedside table.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Getttttt outtta herrrrr.

Maggie interrupts.
MAGGIE
Okay, Oli. Let’s let Vin work with
the therapist.

SPEECH THERAPIST
Thank you. We’1l be about an hour.

VINCENT
Fuccckkk you, annnnn hour.

SPEECH THERAPIST
Maybe less.
79.

Maggie covers Oliver's ears.
DAKA
Why mean, you are? You could stop
breathing.
Maggie pulls Daka and Oliver out of the room.

MAGGIE
Let’s go get a snack.

INT. HOSPITAL BREAK / SNACK ROOM - LATER

Maggie, Oliver and Daka are sitting in the visitor’s
lounge drinking coffee. Daka is eating a candy bar.

MAGGIE
He may talk like that for a while.
That's what happens sometimes when
a person has a stroke.

OLIVER
He sounds...

DAKA
Like the retard.

Out of anyone else’s mouth that would be offensive.
DAKA (CONT'D)
Well, he’s a stupid man anyway. So
retard is not far from.
Daka finishes her candy bar.
DAKA (CONT'D)
Do you have a dollar? I’m
starving. I eat nothing today.
Maggie digs in her purse.

MAGGIE
I do.

She opens her wallet. Pulls out a dollar.

DAKA
I think dollar half is better.
Maggie gives her two bucks.

DAKA (CONT'D)
Spasibo.

She's off to the vending machines.
MAGGIE

(re: her belly)
Is that Vincent’s...?
80.

OLIVER
Baby?

MAGGIE
Yea.

OLIVER

I don’t know. I avoid the whole
situation. It’s not polite to ask
a woman if she’s pregnant. So.

MAGGIE
Well. She’s obviously pregnant.
So...

OLIVER

Vin's like 90 something. That
would be inappropriate.

Daka returns with two chocolate bars. She offers one to
Oliver.

DAKA
If you hit this machine as first
candy drops, you can get two to
come down. Good?

Oliver takes it. Unwraps. The three of them sit
awkwardly comfortable together.

EXT. BROOKLYN - DAY

Time passes. Spring is in the air.

-- A Homeless Guy, wearing shorts, soaks up the sun from
a bus stop bench.

-- The Buck. An ARTIST is painting the front window for
St. Patty’s Day.

-- Doctor's Office. Ozinski gets his nose bandage
removed. His nose is completely crooked.

-- Vin’s House. The lawn is out of control. A foot
high. A MAILMAN bends down and puts mail in the toppled
mailbox.

INT. VIN'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY

Daka is feeding Felix the Cat the usual: gourmet cat
food.

DAKA
Don't eat fast, shit. I don’t come
for till tomorrow.
81.

Daka looks at the stacks of dishes, mold, dirt, grime,
shit everywhere. Fuck it. She rolls up her sleeves,
turns the sink on. Starts to clean.

INT. VIN’S HOSPITAL ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Vin’s perched in a recliner. Oliver is sitting on his
bed shuffling a stack of flash cards.

OLIVER
Try this one.

He holds up a card. It reads: “I want fresh crab.” Vin
studies the card. Then:

VINCENT
I waannnnnt fresssshh crap.

Oliver looks at the card. Damn Vin.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - ANOTHER DAY

Crespi’s class. Ozinski is presenting in front of the
class. His voice is nasally, due to the “new” nose
alignment.

OZINSKI
And for my real-life saint, I
picked...

He clicks the Smart Board. A picture of Oliver pops up.

OZINSKI (CONT’D)
Oliver Bronstein. He’s like one a
them martyrs. Cause he was
persecuted too, when he first got
here. Mostly by me. And a few
others, who I’m not gonna rat out.
You know who you are.

Ozinski stares directly at a few FELLAS in class.
Brooklyn sinks in his chair.

OZINSKI (CONT’D)
Anyways. He’s my saint. Cause he
forgave me for being such a
dingleberry, when I was acting like
an a-hole.

The CLASS laughs. Oliver is all smiles. He’s a hundred
feet tall.
IMAGES OVER MUSIC:

-- Daka is vacuuming Vin’s living room. It sounds like
she’s sucking up marbles. It’s so damn dirty.
82.

-- Vin and Oliver are racing down a hallway in
wheelchairs. It’s neck and neck. Vin'’s lit cigarette
drops in his lap. Oliver wins.

-- At a grocery store, Maggie and Oliver are buying cat
food. Lots.

-- Oliver wheels a piece of carryon luggage into Vin’s
room. He lays the luggage carefully on the bed and
unzips. Felix the Cat climbs out unaffected.

-- Vin's sitting in a wheelchair outside the hospital (in
street clothes.) A NURSE stands behind him. Daka pulls
up in Vin’s car. Honks. Vin stands up, walks to the car
using a cane.

-- Driving. Daka can barely steer the car over her about-—
to-pop belly. Vin lights a cigarette. Daka snatches it
out of his hand.

DAKA
What is wrong with you?

She tosses it out the window.

INT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

Living room. Daka leads Vin inside. The place is
spotless.

VINCENT
Wherrre’s mmmmmy dirt?
LIVING ROOM - LATER

Vin’s sitting on his couch, looking around. The place is
foreign to him.

Daka waddles in with a plate of food. A turkey sandwich
with a side of carrots. Healthy. Vin inspects.

VINCENT
Whhhhattt’re these?

DAKA
Vegetables, what. You don’t see
these?

VINCENT

Donnnnn’t eeeeat them.

DAKA
You do now, fuck.

Vin picks up the sandwich. Takes a damn bite. What
choice does he have?
83.

DAKA (CONT'D)
You pay me for the hours now, papa.

VINCENT
Whaaaattt for?

DAKA
What, for what? I take care of
your ass. And we don’t bump the
ugly parts no more. So don’t ask.
I’m too fat for this and you’re too
old.

Vin thinks. Shakes his head in agreement. The sandwich
is pretty good.

DAKA (CONT'D)
Fifteen dollars for the hours.
Plus the room and food.

Daka walks out. Vin damn near chokes.

EXT. LA COUNTY FAMILY COURT - ANOTHER DAY

A gray stone court house. A gray day.

INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Maggie, Oliver and their attorney, RICHARD WALTERS are on
one side. On the other side: Oliver’s father, DAVID
BRONSTEIN, tall, dark and disconnected, sits next to his
attorney BARRY BRILLSTERN.

JUDGE REYNOLDS presides, he’s examining a file full of
photos.

JUDGE REYNOLDS
(directed to Richard)
Who is Vincent Canatella?

Richard is stumped. He turns to Maggie.

RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
You know him?

MAGGIE
He’s our next door neighbor. He
watches Oliver sometimes.

RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
Your honor, he’s my client’s
neighbor. He occasionally watches
Oliver. Sometimes.

JUDGE REYNOLDS
He’s a baby sitter?

Again, Richard turns to Maggie.
84.

MAGGIE
Yes. Of sorts. I pay him. And
Oliver goes there after school for
a few hours while I’m at work.

RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
(to Judge)
He’s a baby sitter, your honor. Of
sorts. A paid position. May I ask
why this is relevant?

Judge Reynolds flips through more pictures.

JUDGE REYNOLDS
Is your client aware that Mr.
Canatella takes her son to a race
track and they gamble? He also
takes him to a local bar, The Buck?
And a strip club, The Pink
Cadillac?

Maggie is lost. She looks to Oliver.

OLIVER
We went to see the horses a few
times.

Maggie could die. She turns back to Richard.

MAGGIE
I...this...is news to me.

RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
My client is unaware of these
events. As am I. Which is a big
surprise, I must say, right now.

JUDGE REYNOLDS
I‘ll bet there are quite a few
surprises in this folder then.

Judge Reynolds holds up a pound of pictures. Maggie
gasps.

MAGGIE
Oh, God.

JUDGE REYNOLDS
Daka Parimova? Are you aware of
her occupation?

Richard turns to Maggie. Maggie turns to Oliver. Oliver
whispers in Maggie’s ear. She turns pale white. Maggie
whispers in Richard’s ear. He goes blank.

RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
Your honor, I need a few minutes to
confer with my client.
85.

INT. MAGGIE’S COROLLA - LATER

Driving.
avoiding

Maggie’s so mad, she’s past mad. Oliver's
eye contact.

MAGGIE
I guess gambling at the horse track
is like a math lesson. Have to
figure out how to bet and all that.

OLIVER
The odds.

MAGGIE
Thank you. And the bar...well I
imagine that could fall under
current events.

OLIVER
More like social studies.

MAGGIE
Nice. It’s the strip club and the
hooker that are the ones I can’t
wrap my head around.

OLIVER
Commerce. And biology?

MAGGIE
Don’t talk anymore.

VIN'’S BACKYARD —- CONTINUOUS

Vin’s wearing only underwear, watering the dirt pit he
calls a lawn. It hasn’t seen water in a month. Maggie
yells out from behind him.

MAGGIE
vin!

She yells louder.

He turns.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
vin!

VINCENT
Whyyy do you people think mmmmy
people cannn’t hear?

MAGGIE
What kind of man takes a child
gambling, drinking, smoking?

VINCENT
Oh. Gooodie.
86.

MAGGIE
Hanging out with prostitutes.

VINCENT
What kind of mother leaves her son
with a mannnnn like that?

Ouch.

MAGGIE
Fuck you, Vin.

VINCENT
Now we're talkinnnng.

MAGGIE
Fifty-fifty custody with his
asshole father now. I have you to
thank for that.

VINCENT
You have yourrrrrrself to thank for
that. He needs someone besides his
deadbeat mother.

That’s rough.

MAGGIE
Good one. Maybe I deserve it. I
left him with you. What the hell
was I thinking?

VINCENT
Mmmmy sentiments exactly.

MAGGIE
He can’t come over here anymore.
That’s a given. I/’11 get that
fence money to you real soon.

VINCENT
They'll be sommmme interest.

Maggie shakes her head, walks off. Vin squirts the hose,
it hits Maggie's back.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Sorrrryy. I’m a littttle slower
with the reaction time these days.

MAGGIE
You were never fast. Just stupid.

INT. VIN’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Vin sits at his counter. Looking at the biggest pile of
bills and mail. He fishes through, tossing most aside.
Eventually the answering machine comes into view. The
red light is blinking.
87.
Vin hits play.

ANA (V.O.)
Hello, Mr. Vincent. This is Ana
from Sunnyside. I have some news
about your wife, Sandy, sir.

INT. VIN’S CAR - THE NEXT DAY

Daka is driving. Vin riding. The answering machine
plays under.

ANA (V.O.)
(another message)

Mr. Vincent, this is Ana again at

Sunnyside, sir. I’ve left you a

few messages now. I hope that you

are okay...

INT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - CONTINUOUS

Vin’s walking down the hallway. The answering machine
continues.

SHIRLEY (V.O.)
Mr. Canatella, this is Shirley
Jorstin over here at Sunnyside.
Sir, I hate to be the bearer of bad
news, but your wife is dead. And
she’s been dead for a few weeks
now. And we haven’t heard from
you. Which is concerning as well.

SHIRLEY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Vin’s sitting at Shirley’s desk. Shirley enters with a
box of personal items.

SHIRLEY
Oookay, Mr. Canatella. Here we go.

Shirley sits. Puts the box on her desk.
SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
All her personal items are in
there, sir.

Vin looks at the box.

VINCENT
Where is shhhee?

SHIRLEY
Who?

VINCENT

My wwwife.
88.

SHIRLEY
She died, Mr. Canatella.

VINCENT
I know that. Where isss she?

SHIRLEY
(indicates the box)
She’s in there, sir.

VINCENT
Where?

SHIRLEY
In the box. Her remains.

Vin is speechless. For once.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
She died a few weeks ago, Mr.
Canatella. We tried to contact you
several times. So there’s that.
And when we didn’t hear back from
you. Well. We just went ahead and
followed your death directives,
sir.
She pushes a signed paper towards, Vin.
SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
You did want her cremated. That’s
what’s on the signed directives
there.

Vin looks at the paper, then back at the box.

VINCENT
She’s in that bbbox?

SHIRLEY
Her remains are, sir. Yes. Ina
box inside that box. We can’t

just keep a body lying around. I’m
sure you understand. That would be
inappropriate. And legally we just
can’t do that, of course. You
could imagine the litigation
potential.

Vin stands. Takes the box.
SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
I’m sorry for your loss, Mr.
Canatella.

Vin stares at here, then walks away.
89.

SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
There is the other matter of your
outstanding balance we should
discuss.

Vin keeps walking.
VINCENT
(over his back)
I’11 maiilll it to you.

He’s gone.

EXT. SUNNYSIDE GROUNDS - LATER

Vin’s sitting on the bench in front of the pond. Sandy’s
spot. Daka sits next to him. The box in the middle.

DAKA
This place is peace.

VINCENT
It wwwwas.

He lights a smoke.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
Tellll mmme what’s in there, would
ya.
Daka opens the lid on the box.

DAKA
A photo picture of...

Inspects it. Pulls it out. It’s Vin and Sandy’s wedding
picture.

DAKA (CONT'D)
Is this you?

Vin nods.

DAKA (CONT'D)
This is her?

He nods again.

DAKA (CONT'D)
You go downhill.

VINCENT
You’1ll ggget there.

She digs around in the box.
DAKA

There is another box. Like a suede
or leather kind cover.
90.

VINCENT
Dddon’t touch that one.

Fishes. Pulls out an envelope.

DAKA
This has “Vincent” on writing.

Vin takes the envelope. Opens it. Official looking
paperwork...and a key. Hmm.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM - ANOTHER DAY

Oliver and Ozinski are sitting against a wall. A dodge
ball game in progress in front of them.

OZINSKI
Being with your dad ain’t so bad.
Least he’s around. And wants to
see ya.

OLIVER
My mom’s the one who hates it.

OZINSKI
That’s her problem. These woman
gotta learn to let go.

Oliver is impressed with the rare deep thought.

OZINSKI (CONT’D)
I’m seeing a shrink.

OLIVER
That’s cool.

OZINSKI
My Ma’s makin’ me. Thinks me
acting out all the time is due to
the fact that my father left us and
I got no positive male role model
in my life. So I do bad shit to
get attention.

OLIVER
What’s the shrink say?

OZINSKI
He thinks my Ma is overbearing and
controlling and actually I’m acting
out to rebel against her.

OLIVER
That makes more sense.

OZINSKI
That's what I’m fucking thinkin’.
gl.

OLIVER
You talk to her about it.

OZINSKI
No. She’d whop my ass.

A whistle blows. The dodge ball game is over. Next up.
OZINSKI (CONT’D)
Let’s tag team these ass fags. You
go high, I’1ll shoot for the nuts.

Oliver and Ozinski run onto the court.

EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES —- SIDEWALKS

After school. KIDS everywhere. Oliver’s walking out
with Ozinski. A HORN honks. Maggie’s sitting in her car
in parent pickup.

INT. MAGGIE’S COROLLA - LATER

Maggie’s driving. Oliver’s riding. And a strange Latin
lady is sitting quietly in the backseat. This is AMELDA.
Oliver’s new nanny. Short, stout, pointless.

MAGGIE
It’s your father’s idea of safer
child care.

OLIVER
Does she speak English?

MAGGIE

(to Amelda)

Poquito?

AMELDA
Si.

MAGGIE
Guess that’s good enough.

AMELDA
Si.

MAGGIE
Yes. Si.

OLIVER
Everyday?

MAGGIE

And every other weekend when you go
to your dad’s.

Oliver’s not thrilled.
92.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
That’s the deal now. You get
shuffled back and forth between
your father and I.

OLIVER
He is my dad.

Maggie takes this in.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
I know he cheated on you. A bunch
of times. And that why we left.

MAGGIE
You know that?

OLIVER
It’s a secret? You tell anybody
who'll listen. Grandma, Aunt Judy,
all the cousins. It’s also your
Facebook status.

MAGGIE
I been meaning to change that

Maggie considers this.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
I'll just say that I’m single.
EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - DAY
Backyard. Vin’s sitting on a beach chair, staring at the
box with Sandy in it, perched on the lawn table in front

of him.

Oliver walks around the side of the house. Amelda’s
right behind him.

VINCENT
You cannnn’t be here.

OLIVER
Mom said I could say goodbye.

Oliver just stands there. Not knowing what to say.

VINCENT
That mmmy replacement?

OLIVER
Yea. I guess so.

VINCENT
She 1llllegal?

Amelda chimes in.
93.

AMELDA
Si.

VINCENT
Hate to havvvve to report your
mother to the immagrrrration and
naatturallll1111-
(to fucking hard to say)
(for Amelda)
She comprendes.

Amelda bulls up.

AMELDA
Mr. Oliver, vamanos.

She makes her way back from where she came.

OLIVER
What’s in the box?

VINCENT
Mmmmmy wife.

OLIVER
She...died?

VINCENT

No. Sssshe shrunk herself and now
she’s living in there rent free.

OLIVER
Oh. I’m really sorry, Vin.

VINCENT
Never understood wwwwhy people
sssssay that.

OLIVER
They don’t know what else to say.
VINCENT
Welllll, it’s a shit saying. How
‘bout, “What was she like?” “Do
you miss her?” “What're ya gonna

do now?”
Oliver has no words.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Listennnn. Do yourself a favor,
kid, and get a life. Oookay. Stop
living mine. It hasn’t been for
shit.

OLIVER
That’s not true.

Vin lashes out.
94.

VINCENT
The hhhell do you know about me?
You act like I’m some kinda role
model. Are you stupid?

Oliver strikes back.

OLIVER
Yeah, I’m stupid. Mostly for
thinking you were more than just a
drunk, mean, old man.

Oliver starts to tear.

VINCENT
Don’t cry while your fighting.

OLIVER
Don’t teach me any more gems, Vin.
Save ‘em for the nobody left in
your life.

Toe to toe. Vin backs down.

VINCENT
I guess that’s goodbye. Very
touching.

OLIVER
Your sad.

Oliver walks off. Vin stares at the box.

VIN'S BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS

Vin’s sitting on the bed. The box, next to him. He
talks to it.

VINCENT
I loved you to the moon there,
Sandy.

Then...

VINCENT (CONT'D)
So...what nnnnnow?

Vin inspects the room: packed full of shit, memories,
pictures. It hasn’t been touched since she left.

Vin grabs a picture of himself and a FEW MARINES posing
in Ho Chi Minh. He studies it. Then throws it in a bag.
He grabs another picture. Then another. Throwing
everything in site, all the memories, pictures,
knickknacks into the bag. Purging.
95.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Vin drags two full trash bag loads of junk across the
lawn. He dumps them into trash barrels.

INT. OLIVER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Oliver watches Vin from his bedroom window. He shuts the
blinds and sits on his bed. Thinking.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - LIBRARY - DAY

Computer lab. Oliver, Ozinski and OTHER STUDENTS are
working on computers, wearing headsets. Oliver digs in
his backpack and pulls out Vin’s Vietnam picture. The
one Vin tossed in the trash.

He flips the picture over, reads the handwritten
inscription: “la Drang, Vietnam, 1965. Sgt. Vincent
Canatella.”

Oliver pecks on his keyboard:

Insert - Google search bar typing: “Sgt. Vincent
Canatella.”

The search reveals several pages with headings: “War
Hero,” “Bronze Star,” “Sgt. Canatella Rescues Two
Officers,” “The Battle of la Drang.” Etc.

Oliver clicks on the first link and starts reading. A
picture of a younger Vin pops up. He’s a proud looking
soldier.

Oliver hits Ozinski. He leans over and looks.
OZINSKI
(too loud)
That’s the old fucker.

Oliver nods. Everyone and their mother heard that.

INT. CRESPI’S CLASS - LATER
Crespi’s concluding class. As kids shuffle out.

CRESPI
Two weeks, children. The grand
stage, as they say. Our “Saints”
assembly. Don’t forget to invite
your parents, significant others,
etc., etc.

Crespi stops Oliver and Ozinski.
96.

CRESPI (CONT'D)
No expletives in your presentation,
Ozinski.

OZINSKI
My name’s Robert, sir.

OLIVER
He doesn’t like Ozinski, Brother
Crespi. Never has.

And with that the two boys walk off.

INT. BANK — DAY

Vin’s being escorted through the vault by his favorite
banker, Terry. He’s looking through a file.

TERRY
She rented the box about eight
years ago, Mr. Canatella. Prepaid
to the end of this year actually.
They stop in front of a row of safety deposit boxes.

TERRY (CONT'D)
I have to key in with you.

Terry puts his key in the slot of a small box. Vin pulls
his key out of his jacket. Keys in. It opens.

Vin stares at Terry until...

TERRY (CONT'D)
I'll be outside, sir.

Vin opens the door to the box. There’s only one thing
inside of it: a trifold pamphlet. He pulls it out.
Unfolds it.

It’s a life insurance policy. Vin leans against the
boxes. Shakes his head at the blessing.

MONTAGE OF OLIVER RESEARCHING, VIN MOVING ON

EXT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - DAY

EXT. RACETRACK - PARKING LOT - DAY
Vin’s car. Daka is driving. Vin directs.

box. Hangs it on the rear-view mirror.

VINCENT
Best thing that ever happened to
me.

Daka pulls in.

INT. RACETRACK - BREEZEWAY - LATER

Zaucko's walking down a quiet breezeway, whistling. He
turns a corner.

CRACK! He’s hit in the face with a cane. Falls
backwards, dazed, bleeding from the mouth. Teeth are
gone.

Vin hovers above him, waving his cane.
98.

VINCENT
That’ssss the for the elder abuse,
asshole.
Vin tosses an envelope on Zucko’s chest.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
There’s my dues. Plus interest.
Don’t come around no more. I’m
done with the horses.

Vin walks off, a spring in his step.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM - ANOTHER DAY

The chin-up bar. Oliver's pulling with all his might. A
CROWD OF CLASSMATES, lead by Ozinski, scream him on from
the ground.

OZINSKI & CLASSMATES
Oliver! Oliver! Oliver! Oliver!

Coach Mitchell smiles, watching in anticipation.

Oliver strains, pulls, twists. And finally, his chin
goes over the bar. The kids erupt in cheers. Oliver
drops like a sack of potatoes.

EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - SIDEWALKS - DAY

Oliver is walking towards a new Jaguar parked in parent
pickup. It’s his dad, David, waiting.

INT. FROZEN YOGURT SHOP - LATER

So. How’s things?

Good. Can’t complain.

DAVID
Mom. Good?

OLIVER
Yep.

DAVID
Friends?

OLIVER

Dad. We don’t have to small talk.
Whatever happened between you and
mom, that’s your deal.

(MORE)
99.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
I don’t want to be in the middle.
We can just be us. Okay?

DAVID
Got it.

They eat in comfortable silence. Then...

DAVID (CONT'D)
How’s school?

Oliver smiles.

EXT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - ANOTHER DAY

holds the door open.

INT. OLIVER’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

all they know.

DAVID

MAGGIE
Sure.
DAVID
Okay, then.
MAGGIE
Yep.

David gets into the car. Maggie knocks on the passenger
window.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
You know, this is okay. I’m okay
with it. You’re his father. An
asshole. But still his father.
So. I’1l get over it. Just going
to take some time.
100.

DAVID
Good night.
MAGGIE
That’s all you’re going to say?
DAVID
I don’t disagree with anything you
said. So.
MAGGIE

Even the asshole part.

DAVID
Yes. Even that.

Maggie thinks.

MAGGIE
Alright. Good night.

DAVID
Good night.

David drives off.

INT. HOME DEPOT - ANOTHER DAY

INT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

Vin is peeking out the living room blinds. Watching
Oliver, Ozinski and Amelda fixing his fence.

VINCENT
(re: the fence)
Ttthat’1l be straight.

He shuts the blinds.
101.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Oliver, Ozinski and Amelda are working on the fence.
Amelda’s the “foreman,” as she’s the only one who knows
what she’s doing.

Daka pulls up in Vin’s car. Lumbers down the driveway
with a bag of groceries.

DAKA
Does he know you fix this?

OLIVER
He peeks through the blinds every
few minutes.

DAKA
He don’t come looking?

OLIVER
Nope.

DAKA

(disgusted)

This one. Still play the stroke
card.

INT. NAT’S BROOKLYN DINER - ANOTHER DAY

Oliver is interviewing Daka. Amelda is eating, along for
the ride. Daka is holding a flier for Oliver's school
assembly: “Saints Among Us.”

DAKA
Why you want him come see this?
He’s big asshole.

OLIVER
I think he’s just misunderstood.
By himself mostly.

DAKA
Cause asshole, yes?

OLIVER
That's a possibility.

Jesus comes over, refills Daka’s coffee.

DAKA
(to Jesus)
Jesus. I look for job application.
You have this?

JESUS
Si.

DAKA
You bring for me?
102.

JESUS
Si.
Jesus is off. Oliver's impressed.
DAKA
They need someone speak English for
here.

END OF MONTAGE

INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

Oliver’s room is full of Vin’s pictures. The memories
rescued from the trash. Oliver’s getting ready for
school. Standing in front of a mirror, tying a Windsor
Knot on his tie. Maggie calls from the kitchen.

MAGGIE (0.S.)
Oliver. Breakfast is ready.

Oliver furrows with confusion.

THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Oliver walks in to find a full pancake breakfast. Bacon.
Toast. The works. A big surprise in this household.
Maggie’s pouring OJ.

MAGGIE
Gotta have fuel for your big day.

Oliver is touched.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
I took the day off.

He hugs his mom.

OLIVER
Thanks, mom.

MAGGIE
You’re welcome, bub.

Somehow Maggie’s become a mother.

OLIVER
I love you.

MAGGIE
Don’t get sentimental on me.

She kisses his head.
103.

INT. VIN’S LIVING ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

Vin’s sitting is his Lazy Boy, zoned out on Abbott &
Costello. Daka rushes into the room.

DAKA
I think my water is broken.

VINCENT
Calllll a plumber.

She kicks his chair.

DAKA
Get up. Fuck.

Vin climbs out of his chair. Damn baby.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

The auditorium is packed to the gills with STUDENTS,
TEACHERS, PARENTS and GUESTS. The curtain opens and
Brother Crespi’s entire class walks out and takes seats
behind the on-stage podium. Oliver and Ozinski sit next
to each other. Friends for life.

A projection screen displays the banner, “Saints Among
Us.” The CROWD applauds.

INT. VIN’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Daka is driving like a nut. Vin’s white knuckled. He
tries to light a cigarette. Daka swipes it from his
mouth, tosses it out the window.

DAKA
When you become like man?

She shakes her head in disgust, then goes back to fake
deep breathing.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

Brother Crespi steps up to the podium and announces the
next speaker.

BROTHER CRESPI
Our next speaker is Mr. Oliver
Bronstein.

The CROWD claps. Maggie hoots from her seat. She’s
sitting next to ex-husband David. They may end up civil.

Oliver walks up to the podium. Strong. Courageous. A
different kid than the one who couldn’t utter a word in
front of his class. He clears his throat.
104.

OLIVER
Saints are human beings we
celebrate for their dedication and
commitment to other human beings.
Brother Cary Crespi, circa around
January...

Laughs.

EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES —- CONTINUOUS

Daka whips the car into the school's lot. Pulls into a
handicapped spot. Vin is suspect.

VINCENT
This isn’t the hospital.

Daka tosses the flier in his lap.

DAKA
Get inside.

Daka steps out of the car, moves on. Vin looks at the
flier.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

Oliver’s in mid-presentation. On the massive projection
screen behind him, we see a portrait of St. William of
Rochester. Click. The screen refreshes, and a picture
of Vin pops up.

OLIVER
For my modern day saint, I chose a
man who shares many of the same
qualities as St. William of
Rochester: Mr. Vincent Canatella.

He continues.

INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - CONTINUOUS

Outside the auditorium. Vincent stands in front of a
marquee board. It’s the “Saint Wall.” Under each
student's name are two pictures: a real Saint next to a
Modern Day Saint.

Under Oliver Bornstein, we find: St. William of Rochester
and...Vincent Canatella. And he’s one fucked-up looking
“saint.” Eyes black, face distorted, assuredly on drugs,
lying in his hospital bed.

Vin stares at the picture of himself.

He hears Oliver’s voice within. Walks to the auditorium
doors.
105.

OLIVER (0.S.)

Mr. Canatella was born in Newark,
NJ, in 1950, the son of first
generation Italian immigrants.

Vin cracks the door open. Just as he’s doing this a
PRIEST comes up behind him and opens it the rest of the
way.

FATHER
(whispers )
After you...

Vin defaults. Walks in first. He stands at the back of
the auditorium. Oliver continues:

OLIVER
Growing up poor on the streets of
New Jersey, Vincent learned all the
things a kid shouldn’t need to
know. Fighting, cursing and
gambling.

The slide show shuffles images of VINCENT AS A BABY.
Then a YOUNG BOY. Poor. Tough. Street. Pictures of a
hard life. All the memories Vin had tossed in the trash.

OLIVER (CONT'D)

In 1965, as a member of United
States Army’s 5th Regiment, Vincent
was among the 450 soldiers dropped
into the la Drang Valley, and
immediately ambushed by 2000 enemy
troops.

A headshot of Vincent as a young Marine in Vietnam.
Smoking a cigarette, proud, strong.

OLIVER (CONT'D)

There he heroically saved the lives
of two wounded officers pinned down
by enemy fire and carried them to
safety.

Newspaper clippings of Vin’s heroics. A picture of Vin
receiving the Bronze Star. In the back of the
auditorium, Vin is frozen...seeing his life through the
eyes of another.

OLIVER (CONT'D)

I imagine the best way I can tell
you who Vincent Canatella is...is
to tell you what he’s done for me.

For the first time, Oliver sees Vin standing in back.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
When my mom and I first moved here,
we knew no one.

(MORE)
106.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
And Mr. Canatella took me in. When
he didn’t have to. And probably
didn’t want to.

Laughter.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
But he did it anyhow. That’s what
saints do.

A wedding picture of Vin and Sandy pops up on the screen.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
We visited his wife of forty years,
Sandy, who recently passed away.
Vin's done her laundry every week
for the past eight years, long
after she no longer recognized him.

Another picture of Vin and Sandy.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Because saints never give up.

A picture of VIN AS A FIGHTER, with boxing gloves on.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
He taught me how to fight. How to
stand my ground and be brave. How
to speak up and be bold.

Maggie is crying. David hands her a tissue.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Because saints fight for themselves
and others. So that they might be
heard.

Vin is glued, hearing what he means to another, is the
warmth that melts an iceberg.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
He taught me how to gamble. Horse
racing, Keno, the over and under.
Which is a big reason why I’m
grounded till I’m eighteen.

Laughs.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
But in that I learned how to take
risks and go for broke. Because in
life the odds can be stacked
against you.

A picture of Vin’s cat, Felix.
107.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
This is Vin’s cat, Felix, who eats
gourmet cat food. While Vin eats
sardines.

The CROWD loves it.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Because saints make sacrifices.

Maggie, David and Daka are mesmerized, proud, inspired.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Mr. Vincent Canatella is flawed.
He’s rough, drinks too much, smokes
and curses. He’s angry, mad at the
world, and I’m sure full of
regrets.

Vin takes it in.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Because after all, saints are human
beings. Very human beings.

The picture of St. William next to Vincent replays on the
projection screen.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Courage, sacrifice, compassion and
humanity. These are the markings
of a saint. And what makes Mr.
Vincent Canatella not so far
removed from St. William of
Rochester...

Vin’s picture solos on the presentation.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
And with that, I’d like to present
my friend and baby sitter, Mr.
Vincent Canatella for sainthood.
And hereby proclaim him St. Vincent
of Van Wyck street.

The place is wild with applause.

Vin doesn’t know what to do. People are looking around
for him. Finally...he starts walking down the aisle.

Brother Crespi helps Vin up the steps. And towards
Oliver, who’s holding the “Saint Medal.”

Vin steps in front of Oliver. He leans over as Oliver
puts the medal around his neck.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Thank you, sir.
108.

VINCENT
Thanks, kkkid.

And...without warning...Vin gets a tear in his eye.
Maybe for the first time in his life.

PEOPLE rise in their seats to applaud him.

Oliver hugs Vin.

INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - ANOTHER DAY

The break room. Oliver and Vin stand in front of a
vending machine, considering their options. Vin’s
wearing scrubs. His speech impediment is not so
abstruse.

VINCENT
They got the same selection from
when I was a kid.

OLIVER
Surely not. They’d be really
rotten by now.

VINCENT
Nah. They’re all jacked up on
preservatives. Crap has the half
life of plutonium.

Oliver digs in his pocket for change.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
I got it. I owe you money anyhow.
What’s it going to be?

OLIVER
The hard pretzels.

VINCENT
Just what I was looking at.

Vin puts coins in the slot.
VINCENT (CONT'D)
Hit the buttons would ya. If I do
it, we’ll end up with Twinkies.
Oliver keys in the selection.
OLIVER
If you hit it just right...you
can...

Oliver hits the machine just as the bag of pretzels is
about to drop.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
«+.get two for the price of one.
109.

A second bag of pretzels drops down behind the first.

OLIVER (CONT'D)
Pretty cool.

Oliver grabs both bags, hands one to Vin.

VINCENT
And we call that stealing.

Oliver thinks about it. A NURSE pops her head into the
room.

NURSE
Mr. Canatella, it’s about that
time.
Vin rushes off.
VINCENT

Hold your horses.

Oliver stands there, eating his pretzels. He digs into
his pockets, grabs some change and slips it in the coin
slot. He walks off.

INT. LABOR & DELIVERY ROOM - LATER

Daka is in the final stages of giving birth. She’s calm
and focused. A DOCTOR between her legs calls out the
final push. The BABY is crowning.

DOCTOR
One more time. Big breath. Big
push.

DAKA
You say one more time every time
you say.

DOCTOR
This time I mean it. You’re almost
there.

Daka pushes. And a BABY is born. The doctor does his
thing, suctioning, inspecting.

DAKA
Let me look.

The doctor holds her up.

DOCTOR
Here she is.

The baby cries. A voice from the corner breaks the
moment :
110.

VINCENT (0.S.)
What is it?

Vin has one foot in the room, one out.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Black, white, ugly?

DAKA
Get out now. Fuck.

VINCENT
What’s wrong with asking?

A Nurse takes the baby.

NURSE
(to Daka)
You want him to cut the cord?

DAKA
No. No touch the child.

VINCENT
I’m a little shaky. Let a
professional handle that.

The Nurse cuts the cord. Vin sneaks a closer look at the
baby.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Sure aren’t pretty when they pop
out.

DAKA
Get out of here.

Vin walks off. Mumbles.
VINCENT
When she’s doped up...no sense ‘a
humor.
The doctor rests the baby on Daka’s bosom.
DAKA

Come here. My little princessa.
Let me hold you.

INT. VIN’'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

A “family” dinner. Daka is serving a homemade meal of
spaghetti and green beans. Fancy it’s not.

Oliver and Ozinski sit on one side of the table. Maggie
on the opposite side. The baby’s in a bassinet, set
within a high chair. And Vin is in the captain’s seat.
111.

VINCENT
(re: the food)
It’s colorful. I’11 say that.

DAKA
How you try don’t say nothing.

MAGGIE
I love green beans.

Oliver jumps in.

OLIVER
You do?

MAGGIE
Sure. Don’t get ‘em that often.

OZINSKI
My ma makes ‘em out of the can.

VINCENT
That's why your brain is stilted.

Daka sits. Vin starts to dig in.

VINCENT (CONT'D)
Well. Beats hunger. By a hair.

Everyone just stares at him.

OLIVER

Don’t you want to say something?
VINCENT

Like what?
OLIVER

A blessing or something.

Vin thinks. Lowers his head, closes his eyes. Thinks
better.

VINCENT
I better not.

Figures.

EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The camera pulls back from the house, as the MAILMAN, on
all fours on the front lawn, shoves mail in the felled
box.

VINCENT (0.S.)
You waiting for a paper invitation?
This crap ain’t good enough to eat
cold.
112.

We float past the “fixed” fence and up into the
atmosphere above Brooklyn.

FADE TO BLACK.

The end.
